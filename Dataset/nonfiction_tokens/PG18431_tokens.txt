preface
the
point
of
view
of
this
book
is
human
interest
in
the
other
worlds
around
us
it
presents
the
latest
discoveries
among
the
planets
of
the
solar
system
and
shows
their
bearing
upon
the
question
of
life
in
those
planets
it
points
out
the
resemblances
and
the
differences
between
the
earth
and
the
other
worlds
that
share
with
it
in
the
light
of
the
sun
it
shows
what
we
should
see
and
experience
if
we
could
visit
those
worlds
while
basing
itself
upon
facts
it
does
not
exclude
the
discussion
of
interesting
probabilities
and
theories
that
have
commanded
wide
popular
attention
it
points
out
for
instance
what
is
to
be
thought
of
the
idea
of
interplanetary
communication
it
indicates
what
must
be
the
outlook
of
the
possible
inhabitants
of
some
of
the
other
planets
toward
the
earth
as
far
as
may
be
it
traces
the
origin
and
development
of
the
other
worlds
of
our
system
and
presents
a
graphic
picture
of
their
present
condition
as
individuals
and
of
their
wonderful
contrasts
as
members
of
a
common
family
in
short
the
aim
of
the
author
has
been
to
show
how
wide
and
how
rich
is
the
field
of
interest
opened
to
the
human
mind
by
man
discoveries
concerning
worlds
which
though
inaccessible
to
him
in
a
physical
sense
offer
intellectual
conquests
of
the
noblest
description
and
finally
in
order
to
assist
those
who
may
wish
to
recognize
for
themselves
these
other
worlds
in
the
sky
this
book
presents
a
special
series
of
charts
to
illustrate
a
method
of
finding
the
planets
which
requires
no
observatory
and
no
instruments

introductory
other
worlds
and
their
inhabitants
are
remarkably
popular
subjects
of
speculation
at
the
present
time
every
day
we
hear
people
asking
one
another
if
it
is
true
that
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
communicate
with
some
of
the
globes
such
as
mars
that
circle
in
company
with
our
earth
about
the
sun
one
of
the
masters
of
practical
electrical
science
in
our
time
has
suggested
that
the
principle
of
wireless
telegraphy
may
be
extended
to
the
transmission
of
messages
across
space
from
planet
to
planet
the
existence
of
intelligent
inhabitants
in
some
of
the
other
planets
has
become
with
many
a
matter
of
conviction
and
for
everybody
it
presents
a
question
of
fascinating
interest
which
has
deeply
stirred
the
popular
imagination
the
importance
of
this
subject
as
an
intellectual
phenomenon
of
the
opening
century
is
clearly
indicated
by
the
extent
to
which
it
has
entered
into
recent
literature
poets
feel
its
inspiration
and
novelists
and
romancers
freely
select
other
planets
as
the
scenes
of
their
stories
one
tells
us
of
a
visit
paid
by
men
to
the
moon
and
of
the
wonderful
things
seen
and
adventures
had
there
lucian
it
is
true
did
the
same
thing
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
but
he
had
not
the
aid
of
hints
from
modern
science
to
guide
his
speculations
and
lend
verisimilitude
to
his
narrative
another
startles
us
from
our
sense
of
planetary
security
with
a
realistic
account
of
the
invasion
of
the
earth
by
the
terrible
sons
of
warlike
mars
seeking
to
extend
their
empire
by
the
conquest
of
foreign
globes
sometimes
it
is
a
trip
from
world
to
world
a
kind
of
celestial
pleasure
yachting
with
depictions
of
creatures
more
wonderful
than
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
that
is
presented
to
our
imagination
and
sometimes
we
are
informed
of
the
visions
beheld
by
the
temporarily
disembodied
spirits
of
trance
mediums
or
other
modern
thaumaturgists
flitting
about
among
the
planets
then
to
vary
the
theme
we
find
charming
inhabitants
of
other
worlds
represented
as
coming
down
to
the
earth
and
sojourning
for
a
time
on
our
dull
planet
to
the
delight
of
susceptible
successors
of
father
adam
who
become
henceforth
ready
to
follow
their
captivating
visitors
to
the
ends
of
the
universe
in
short
writers
of
fiction
have
already
established
interplanetary
communication
to
their
entire
satisfaction
thus
vastly
and
indefinitely
enlarging
the
bounds
of
romance
and
making
us
so
familiar
with
the
peculiarities
of
our
remarkable
brothers
and
sisters
of
mars
venus
and
the
moon
that
we
can
not
help
feeling
notwithstanding
the
many
divergences
in
the
descriptions
that
we
should
certainly
recognize
them
on
sight
wherever
we
might
meet
them
but
the
subject
is
by
no
means
abandoned
to
the
tellers
of
tales
and
the
dreamers
of
dreams
men
of
science
also
eagerly
enter
into
the
discussion
of
the
possibilities
of
other
worlds
and
become
warm
over
it
around
mars
in
particular
a
lively
war
of
opinions
rages
not
all
astronomers
have
joined
in
the
dispute
some
have
not
imagination
enough
and
some
are
waiting
for
more
light
before
choosing
sides
but
those
who
have
entered
the
arena
are
divided
between
two
opposed
camps
one
side
holds
that
mars
is
not
only
a
world
capable
of
having
inhabitants
but
that
it
actually
has
them
and
that
they
have
given
visual
proof
of
their
existence
and
their
intelligence
through
the
changes
they
have
produced
upon
its
surface
the
other
side
maintains
that
mars
is
neither
inhabited
nor
habitable
and
that
what
are
taken
for
vast
public
works
and
engineering
marvels
wrought
by
its
industrious
inhabitants
are
nothing
but
illusions
of
the
telescope
or
delusions
of
the
observer
mind
both
adduce
numerous
observations
telescopic
and
spectroscopic
and
many
arguments
scientific
and
theoretic
to
support
their
respective
contentions
but
neither
side
has
yet
been
able
to
convince
or
silence
the
other
although
both
have
made
themselves
and
their
views
intensely
interesting
to
the
world
at
large
which
would
very
much
like
to
know
what
the
truth
really
is
and
not
only
mars
but
venus
the
beauteous
twin
sister
of
the
earth
who
when
she
glows
in
the
evening
sky
makes
everybody
a
lover
of
the
stars
and
even
mercury
the
moor
among
the
planets
wearing
the
shadowed
livery
of
the
burnished
sun
to
whom
he
is
a
neighbor
and
near
bred
and
jupiter
saturn
and
the
moon
itself
all
these
have
their
advocates
who
refuse
to
believe
that
they
are
lifeless
globes
mere
reflectors
of
useless
sunshine
the
case
of
the
moon
is
in
this
respect
especially
interesting
on
account
of
the
change
that
has
occurred
in
the
opinions
held
concerning
its
physical
condition
for
a
very
long
time
our
satellite
was
confidently
and
almost
universally
regarded
as
an
airless
waterless
lifeless
desert
a
completely
dead
world
a
bare
desiccated
skull
of
rock
circling
about
the
living
earth
but
within
a
few
years
there
has
been
a
reaction
from
this
extreme
view
of
the
lifelessness
of
the
moon
observers
tell
us
of
clouds
suddenly
appearing
and
then
melting
to
invisibility
over
volcanic
craters
of
evidences
of
an
atmosphere
rare
as
compared
with
ours
yet
manifest
in
its
effects
of
variations
of
color
witnessed
in
certain
places
as
the
sunlight
drifts
over
them
at
changing
angles
of
incidence
of
what
seem
to
be
immense
fields
of
vegetation
covering
level
ground
and
of
appearances
indicating
the
existence
of
clouds
of
ice
crystals
and
deposits
of
snow
among
the
mountainous
lunar
landscapes
thus
in
a
manner
the
moon
is
rehabilitated
and
we
are
invited
to
regard
its
silvery
beams
not
as
the
reflections
of
the
surface
of
a
desert
but
as
sent
back
to
our
eyes
from
the
face
of
a
world
that
yet
has
some
slight
remnants
of
life
to
brighten
it
the
suggestion
that
there
is
an
atmosphere
lying
close
upon
the
shell
of
the
lunar
globe
filling
the
deep
cavities
that
pit
its
face
and
penetrating
to
an
unknown
depth
in
its
interior
recalls
a
speculation
of
the
ingenious
and
entertaining
fontenelle
in
the
seventeenth
century
recently
revived
and
enlarged
upon
by
the
author
of
one
of
our
modern
romances
of
adventure
in
the
moon
to
the
effect
that
the
lunar
inhabitants
dwell
beneath
the
surface
of
their
globe
instead
of
on
the
top
of
it
now
because
of
this
widespread
and
continually
increasing
interest
in
the
subject
of
other
worlds
and
on
account
of
the
many
curious
revelations
that
we
owe
to
modern
telescopes
and
other
improved
means
of
investigation
it
is
certainly
to
be
desired
that
the
most
important
and
interesting
discoveries
that
have
lately
been
made
concerning
the
various
globes
which
together
with
the
earth
constitute
the
family
should
be
assembled
in
a
convenient
and
popular
form
and
that
is
the
object
of
this
book
fact
is
admittedly
often
stranger
and
more
wonderful
than
fiction
and
there
are
no
facts
that
appeal
more
powerfully
to
the
imagination
than
do
those
of
astronomy
technical
books
on
astronomy
usually
either
ignore
the
subject
of
the
habitability
of
the
planets
or
dismiss
it
with
scarcely
any
recognition
of
the
overpowering
human
interest
that
it
possesses
hence
a
book
written
specially
from
the
point
of
view
of
that
subject
would
appear
calculated
to
meet
a
popular
want
and
this
the
more
because
since
proctor
wrote
his
other
worlds
than
ours
and
flammarion
his
pluralité
des
mondes
habités
many
most
important
and
significant
discoveries
have
been
made
that
in
several
notable
instances
have
completely
altered
the
aspect
in
which
the
planets
present
themselves
for
our
judgment
as
to
their
conditions
of
habitability
no
doubt
the
natural
tendency
of
the
mind
is
to
regard
all
the
planets
as
habitable
worlds
for
there
seems
to
be
deeply
implanted
in
human
nature
a
consciousness
of
the
universality
of
life
giving
rise
to
a
conviction
that
one
world
even
in
the
material
sense
is
not
enough
for
it
but
that
every
planet
must
belong
to
its
kingdom
we
are
apt
to
say
to
ourselves
the
earth
is
one
of
a
number
of
planets
all
similarly
circumstanced
the
earth
is
inhabited
why
should
not
the
others
also
be
inhabited
what
has
been
learned
of
the
unity
in
chemical
constitution
and
mechanical
operation
prevailing
throughout
the
solar
system
together
with
the
continually
accumulating
evidence
of
the
common
origin
of
its
various
members
and
the
identity
of
the
evolutionary
processes
that
have
brought
them
into
being
all
tends
to
strengthen
the
hypothesis
that
life
is
a
phenomenon
general
to
the
entire
system
and
only
absent
where
its
essential
and
fundamental
conditions
for
special
and
local
and
perhaps
temporary
reasons
do
not
exist
if
we
look
for
life
in
the
sun
for
instance
while
accepting
the
prevalent
conception
of
the
sun
as
a
center
of
intense
thermal
action
we
must
abandon
all
our
ideas
of
the
physical
organization
of
life
formed
upon
what
we
know
of
it
from
experimental
evidence
we
can
not
imagine
any
form
of
life
that
has
ever
been
presented
to
our
senses
as
existing
in
the
sun
but
this
is
not
generally
true
of
the
planets
life
in
our
sense
of
it
is
a
planetary
not
a
solar
phenomenon
and
while
we
may
find
reasons
for
believing
that
on
some
of
the
planets
the
conditions
are
such
that
creatures
organized
like
ourselves
could
not
survive
yet
we
can
not
positively
say
that
every
form
of
living
organism
must
necessarily
be
excluded
from
a
world
whose
environment
would
be
unsuited
for
us
and
our
contemporaries
in
terrestrial
life
although
our
sole
knowledge
of
animated
nature
is
confined
to
what
we
learn
by
experience
on
the
earth
yet
it
is
a
most
entertaining
and
by
no
means
unedifying
occupation
to
seek
to
apply
to
the
exceedingly
diversified
conditions
prevailing
in
the
other
planets
as
astronomical
observations
reveal
them
to
us
the
principles
types
and
limitations
that
govern
the
living
creatures
of
our
world
and
to
judge
as
best
we
can
how
far
those
types
and
limits
may
be
modified
or
extended
so
that
those
other
planets
may
reasonably
be
included
among
the
probable
abodes
of
life
in
order
to
form
such
judgments
each
planet
must
be
examined
by
itself
but
first
it
is
desirable
to
glance
at
the
planetary
system
as
a
whole
to
do
this
we
may
throw
off
in
imagination
the
dominance
of
the
sun
and
suppose
ourselves
to
be
in
the
midst
of
open
space
far
removed
both
from
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
in
this
situation
it
is
only
by
chance
or
through
foreknowledge
that
we
can
distinguish
our
sun
at
all
for
it
is
lost
among
the
stars
and
when
we
discover
it
we
find
that
it
is
only
one
of
the
smaller
and
less
conspicuous
members
of
the
sparkling
host
we
rapidly
approach
and
when
we
have
arrived
within
a
distance
comparable
with
that
of
its
planets
we
see
that
the
sun
has
increased
in
apparent
magnitude
until
now
it
enormously
outshines
all
the
other
stars
and
its
rays
begin
to
produce
the
effect
of
daylight
upon
the
orbs
that
they
reach
but
we
are
in
no
danger
of
mistaking
its
apparent
superiority
to
its
fellow
stars
for
a
real
one
because
we
clearly
perceive
that
our
nearness
alone
makes
it
seem
so
great
and
overpowering
and
now
we
observe
that
this
star
that
we
have
drawn
near
to
has
attending
it
a
number
of
minute
satellites
faintly
shining
specks
that
circle
about
it
as
if
charmed
like
insects
by
its
splendor
it
is
manifest
to
us
at
the
first
glance
that
without
the
sun
these
obedient
little
planets
would
not
exist
it
is
his
attraction
that
binds
them
together
in
a
system
and
his
rays
that
make
them
visible
to
one
another
in
the
abyss
of
space
although
they
vary
in
relative
size
yet
we
observe
a
striking
similarity
among
them
they
are
all
globular
bodies
they
all
turn
upon
their
axes
they
all
travel
about
the
sun
in
the
same
direction
and
their
paths
all
lie
very
nearly
in
one
plane
some
of
them
have
one
or
more
moons
or
satellites
circling
about
them
in
imitation
of
their
own
revolution
about
the
sun
their
family
relationship
to
one
another
and
to
the
sun
is
so
evident
that
it
colors
our
judgment
about
them
as
individuals
and
when
we
happen
to
find
upon
closer
approach
that
one
of
them
the
earth
is
covered
with
vegetation
and
water
and
filled
with
thousands
of
species
of
animated
creatures
we
are
disposed
to
believe
without
further
examination
that
they
are
all
alike
in
this
respect
just
as
they
are
all
alike
in
receiving
light
and
heat
from
the
sun
this
preliminary
judgment
arising
from
the
evident
unity
of
the
planetary
system
can
only
be
varied
by
an
examination
of
its
members
in
detail
one
striking
fact
that
commands
our
attention
as
soon
as
we
have
entered
the
narrow
precincts
of
the
solar
system
is
the
isolation
of
the
sun
and
its
attendants
in
space
the
solar
system
occupies
a
or
flat
circular
expanse
about
miles
across
and
relatively
very
thin
the
sun
being
in
the
center
from
the
sun
to
the
nearest
star
or
other
sun
the
distance
is
approximately
five
thousand
times
the
entire
diameter
of
the
solar
system
but
the
vast
majority
of
the
stars
are
probably
a
hundred
times
yet
more
remote
in
other
words
if
the
solar
system
be
represented
by
a
circular
ten
feet
across
the
nearest
star
must
be
placed
at
a
distance
of
nine
and
a
half
miles
and
the
great
multitude
of
the
stars
at
a
distance
of
nine
hundred
miles
or
to
put
it
in
another
way
let
us
suppose
the
sun
and
his
planets
to
be
represented
by
a
fleet
of
ships
at
sea
all
included
within
a
space
about
half
a
mile
across
then
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
shore
relatively
nearer
than
the
nearest
fixed
star
is
to
the
sun
we
should
have
to
place
our
fleet
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
ocean
while
the
distance
of
the
main
shore
of
the
starry
universe
would
be
so
immense
that
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
would
be
far
too
small
to
hold
the
expanse
of
ocean
needed
to
represent
it
from
these
general
considerations
we
next
proceed
to
recall
some
of
the
details
of
the
system
of
worlds
amid
which
we
dwell
besides
the
earth
the
sun
has
seven
other
principal
planets
in
attendance
these
eight
planets
fall
into
two
classes
the
terrestrial
planets
and
the
major
or
jovian
planets
the
former
class
comprises
mercury
venus
the
earth
and
mars
and
the
latter
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
i
have
named
them
all
in
the
order
of
their
distance
from
the
sun
beginning
with
the
nearest
the
terrestrial
planets
taking
their
class
name
from
the
earth
are
relatively
close
to
the
sun
and
comparatively
small
the
major
planets
or
the
jovian
planets
if
we
give
them
a
common
title
based
upon
the
name
of
their
chief
jupiter
or
jove
are
relatively
distant
from
the
sun
and
are
characterized
both
by
great
comparative
size
and
slight
mean
density
the
terrestrial
planets
are
all
included
within
a
circle
having
the
sun
for
a
center
about
miles
in
radius
the
space
or
gap
between
the
outermost
of
them
mars
and
the
innermost
of
the
jovian
planets
jupiter
is
nearly
two
and
a
half
times
as
broad
as
the
entire
radius
of
the
circle
within
which
they
are
included
and
not
only
is
the
jovian
group
of
planets
widely
separated
from
the
terrestrial
group
but
the
distances
between
the
orbits
of
its
four
members
are
likewise
very
great
and
progressively
increasing
between
jupiter
and
saturn
is
a
gap
miles
across
and
this
becomes
miles
between
saturn
and
uranus
and
more
than
miles
between
uranus
and
neptune
all
of
these
distances
are
given
in
round
numbers
finally
we
come
to
some
very
extraordinary
worlds
if
we
can
call
them
worlds
at
all
the
asteroids
they
form
a
third
group
characterized
by
the
extreme
smallness
of
its
individual
members
their
astonishing
number
and
the
unusual
eccentricities
and
inclinations
of
their
orbits
they
are
situated
in
the
gap
between
the
terrestrial
and
the
jovian
planets
and
about
of
them
have
been
discovered
while
there
is
reason
to
think
that
their
real
number
may
be
many
thousands
the
largest
of
them
is
less
than
miles
in
diameter
and
many
of
those
recently
discovered
may
be
not
more
than
ten
or
twenty
miles
in
diameter
what
marvelous
places
of
abode
such
little
planets
would
be
if
it
were
possible
to
believe
them
inhabited
we
shall
see
more
clearly
when
we
come
to
consider
them
in
their
turn
but
without
regard
to
the
question
of
habitability
the
asteroids
will
be
found
extremely
interesting
in
the
next
chapter
we
proceed
to
take
up
the
planets
for
study
as
individuals
beginning
with
mercury
the
one
nearest
the
sun
chapter
ii
mercury
a
world
of
two
faces
and
many
contrasts
mercury
the
first
of
the
other
worlds
that
we
are
going
to
consider
fascinates
by
its
grotesqueness
like
a
piece
of
chinese
ivory
carving
so
small
is
it
for
its
kind
and
so
finished
in
its
eccentric
details
in
a
little
while
we
shall
see
how
singular
mercury
is
in
many
of
the
particulars
of
planetary
existence
but
first
of
all
let
us
endeavor
to
obtain
a
clear
idea
of
the
actual
size
and
mass
of
this
strange
little
planet
compared
with
the
earth
it
is
so
diminutive
that
it
looks
as
if
it
had
been
cut
out
on
the
pattern
of
a
satellite
rather
than
that
of
an
independent
planet
its
diameter
miles
only
exceeds
the
by
less
than
one
half
while
both
jupiter
and
saturn
among
their
remarkable
collections
of
moons
have
each
at
least
one
that
is
considerably
larger
than
the
planet
mercury
but
insignificant
though
it
be
in
size
it
holds
the
place
of
honor
nearest
to
the
sun
it
was
formerly
thought
that
mercury
possessed
a
mass
greatly
in
excess
of
that
which
its
size
would
seem
to
imply
and
some
estimates
based
upon
the
apparent
effect
of
its
attraction
on
comets
made
it
equal
in
mean
density
to
lead
or
even
to
the
metal
mercury
this
led
to
curious
speculations
concerning
its
probable
metallic
composition
and
the
possible
existence
of
vast
quantities
of
such
heavy
elements
as
gold
in
the
frame
of
the
planet
but
more
recent
and
probably
more
correct
computations
place
mercury
third
in
the
order
of
density
among
the
members
of
the
solar
system
the
earth
ranking
as
first
and
venus
as
second
mercury
density
is
now
believed
to
be
less
than
the
earth
in
the
ratio
of
to
accepting
this
estimate
we
find
that
the
force
of
gravity
upon
the
surface
of
mercury
is
only
one
third
as
great
as
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
a
body
weighing
pounds
on
the
earth
would
weigh
only
pounds
on
mercury
this
is
an
important
matter
because
not
only
the
weight
of
bodies
but
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
and
even
the
nature
of
its
gaseous
constituents
are
affected
by
the
force
of
gravity
and
if
we
could
journey
from
world
to
world
in
our
bodily
form
it
would
make
a
great
difference
to
us
to
find
gravity
considerably
greater
or
less
upon
other
planets
than
it
is
upon
our
own
this
alone
might
suffice
to
render
some
of
the
planets
impossible
places
of
abode
for
us
unless
a
decided
change
were
effected
in
our
present
physical
organization
one
of
the
first
questions
that
we
should
ask
about
a
foreign
world
to
which
we
proposed
to
pay
a
visit
would
relate
to
its
atmosphere
we
should
wish
to
know
in
advance
if
it
had
air
and
water
and
in
what
proportions
and
quantities
however
its
own
peculiar
inhabitants
might
be
supposed
able
to
dispense
with
these
things
to
their
presence
would
be
essential
and
if
we
did
not
find
them
even
a
planet
that
blazed
with
gold
and
diamonds
only
waiting
to
be
seized
would
remain
perfectly
safe
from
our
invasion
now
in
the
case
of
mercury
some
doubt
on
this
point
exists
huggins
vogel
and
others
have
believed
that
they
found
spectroscopic
proof
of
the
existence
of
both
air
and
the
vapor
of
water
on
mercury
but
the
necessary
observations
are
of
a
very
delicate
nature
and
difficult
to
make
and
some
astronomers
doubt
whether
we
possess
sufficient
proof
that
mercury
has
an
atmosphere
at
any
rate
its
atmosphere
is
very
rare
as
compared
with
the
earth
but
we
need
not
on
that
account
conclude
that
mercury
is
lifeless
possibly
in
view
of
certain
other
peculiarities
soon
to
be
explained
a
rare
atmosphere
would
be
decidedly
advantageous
being
much
nearer
the
sun
than
the
earth
is
mercury
can
be
seen
by
us
only
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
sky
where
the
sun
itself
appears
as
it
revolves
in
its
orbit
about
the
sun
it
is
visible
alternately
in
the
evening
for
a
short
time
after
sunset
and
in
the
morning
for
a
short
time
before
sunrise
but
it
can
never
be
seen
as
the
outer
planets
are
seen
in
the
or
late
at
night
when
seen
low
in
the
twilight
at
evening
or
morning
it
glows
with
the
brilliance
of
a
bright
star
and
is
a
beautiful
object
though
few
casual
watchers
of
the
stars
ever
catch
sight
of
it
when
it
is
nearest
the
earth
and
is
about
to
pass
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
it
temporarily
disappears
in
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
and
likewise
when
it
it
is
farthest
from
the
earth
and
passing
around
in
its
orbit
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sun
it
is
concealed
by
the
blinding
solar
rays
consequently
except
with
the
instruments
of
an
observatory
which
are
able
to
show
it
in
broad
day
mercury
is
never
visible
save
during
the
comparatively
brief
periods
of
time
when
it
is
near
its
greatest
apparent
distance
east
or
west
from
the
sun
the
nearer
a
planet
is
to
the
sun
the
more
rapidly
it
is
compelled
to
move
in
its
orbit
and
mercury
being
the
nearest
to
the
sun
of
all
the
planets
is
by
far
the
swiftest
footed
among
them
but
its
velocity
is
subject
to
remarkable
variation
owing
to
the
peculiar
form
of
the
orbit
in
which
the
planet
travels
this
is
more
eccentric
than
the
orbit
of
any
other
planet
except
some
of
the
asteroids
the
sun
being
situated
in
one
focus
of
the
elliptical
orbit
when
mercury
is
at
perihelion
or
nearest
to
the
sun
its
distance
from
that
body
is
miles
but
when
it
is
at
aphelion
or
farthest
from
the
sun
its
distance
is
miles
the
difference
is
no
less
than
miles
when
nearest
the
sun
mercury
darts
forward
in
its
orbit
at
the
rate
of
miles
in
a
second
while
when
farthest
from
the
sun
the
speed
is
reduced
to
miles
now
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
consideration
of
the
wonderful
variations
in
mercury
distance
from
the
sun
for
we
shall
find
that
their
effects
are
absolutely
startling
and
that
they
alone
suffice
to
mark
a
wide
difference
between
mercury
and
the
earth
considered
as
the
abodes
of
sentient
creatures
the
total
change
of
distance
amounts
as
already
remarked
to
miles
which
is
almost
half
the
entire
distance
separating
the
planet
from
the
sun
at
perihelion
this
immense
variation
of
distance
is
emphasized
by
the
rapidity
with
which
it
takes
place
mercury
periodic
time
the
period
required
for
it
to
make
a
single
revolution
about
the
sun
or
in
other
words
the
length
of
its
year
is
of
our
days
in
just
one
half
of
that
time
or
in
about
six
weeks
it
passes
from
aphelion
to
perihelion
that
is
to
say
in
six
weeks
the
whole
change
in
its
distance
from
the
sun
takes
place
in
six
weeks
mercury
falls
miles
for
it
a
fall
though
in
a
curve
instead
of
a
straight
line
falls
miles
toward
the
sun
and
as
it
falls
like
any
other
falling
body
it
gains
in
speed
until
having
reached
the
perihelion
point
its
terrific
velocity
counteracts
its
approach
and
it
begins
to
recede
at
the
end
of
the
next
six
weeks
it
once
more
attains
its
greatest
distance
and
turns
again
to
plunge
sunward
of
course
it
may
be
said
of
every
planet
having
an
elliptical
orbit
that
between
aphelion
and
perihelion
it
is
falling
toward
the
sun
but
no
other
planet
than
mercury
travels
in
an
orbit
sufficiently
eccentric
and
approaches
sufficiently
near
to
the
sun
to
give
to
the
mind
so
vivid
an
impression
of
an
actual
stupendous
fall
next
let
us
consider
the
effects
of
this
rapid
fall
or
approach
toward
the
sun
which
is
so
foreign
to
our
terrestrial
experience
and
so
appalling
to
the
imagination
first
we
must
remember
that
the
nearer
a
planet
is
to
the
sun
the
greater
is
the
amount
of
heat
and
light
that
it
receives
the
variation
being
proportional
to
the
inverse
square
of
the
distance
the
distance
from
the
sun
being
miles
while
mercury
is
only
it
follows
to
begin
with
that
mercury
gets
on
the
average
more
than
six
and
a
half
times
as
much
heat
from
the
sun
as
the
earth
does
that
alone
is
enough
to
make
it
seem
impossible
that
mercury
can
be
the
home
of
living
forms
resembling
those
of
the
earth
for
imagine
the
heat
of
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
day
increased
six
or
seven
fold
if
there
were
no
mitigating
influences
the
face
of
the
earth
would
shrivel
as
in
the
blast
of
a
furnace
the
very
stones
would
become
incandescent
and
the
oceans
would
turn
into
steam
still
notwithstanding
the
tremendous
heat
poured
upon
mercury
as
compared
with
that
which
our
planet
receives
we
can
possibly
and
for
the
sake
of
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
effects
of
the
varying
distance
which
is
the
object
of
our
present
inquiry
find
a
loophole
to
admit
the
chance
that
yet
there
may
be
living
beings
there
we
might
for
instance
suppose
that
owing
to
the
rarity
of
its
atmosphere
the
excessive
heat
was
quickly
radiated
away
or
that
there
was
something
in
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
that
greatly
modified
the
effective
temperature
of
the
sun
rays
but
having
satisfied
our
imagination
on
this
point
and
placed
our
supposititious
inhabitants
in
the
hot
world
of
mercury
how
are
we
going
to
meet
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
rapid
changes
of
distance
the
swift
fall
of
the
planet
toward
the
sun
followed
by
the
equally
swift
rush
away
from
it
for
change
of
distance
implies
change
of
heat
and
temperature
it
is
true
that
we
have
a
slight
effect
of
this
kind
on
the
earth
between
midsummer
of
the
northern
hemisphere
and
midwinter
our
planet
draws
miles
nearer
the
sun
but
the
change
occupies
six
months
and
at
the
earth
great
average
distance
the
effect
of
this
change
is
too
slight
to
be
ordinarily
observable
and
only
the
astronomer
is
aware
of
the
consequent
increase
in
the
apparent
size
of
the
sun
it
is
not
to
this
variation
of
the
sun
distance
but
rather
to
the
changes
of
the
seasons
depending
on
the
inclination
of
the
earth
axis
that
we
owe
the
differences
of
temperature
that
we
experience
in
other
words
the
total
supply
of
heat
from
the
sun
is
not
far
from
uniform
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
the
variations
of
temperature
depend
upon
the
distribution
of
that
supply
between
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
which
are
alternately
inclined
sunward
but
on
mercury
the
supply
of
solar
heat
is
itself
variable
to
an
enormous
extent
in
six
weeks
as
we
have
seen
mercury
diminishes
its
distance
from
the
sun
about
one
third
which
is
proportionally
ten
times
as
great
a
change
of
distance
as
the
earth
experiences
in
six
months
the
inhabitants
of
mercury
in
those
six
pregnant
weeks
see
the
sun
expand
in
the
sky
to
more
than
two
and
a
half
times
its
former
magnitude
while
the
solar
heat
poured
upon
them
swiftly
augments
from
something
more
than
four
and
a
half
times
to
above
eleven
times
the
amount
received
upon
the
earth
then
immediately
the
retreat
of
the
planet
begins
the
sun
visibly
shrinks
as
a
receding
balloon
becomes
smaller
in
the
eyes
of
its
watchers
the
heat
falls
off
as
rapidly
as
it
had
previously
increased
until
the
aphelion
point
being
reached
the
process
is
again
reversed
and
thus
it
goes
on
unceasingly
the
sun
growing
and
diminishing
in
the
sky
and
the
heat
increasing
and
decreasing
by
enormous
amounts
with
astonishing
rapidity
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
way
in
which
atmospheric
influences
could
equalize
the
effects
of
such
violent
changes
or
any
adjustments
in
the
physical
organization
of
living
beings
that
could
make
such
changes
endurable
but
we
have
only
just
begun
the
story
of
mercury
peculiarities
we
come
next
to
an
even
more
remarkable
contrast
between
that
planet
and
our
own
during
the
paris
exposition
of
a
little
company
of
astronomers
was
assembled
at
the
juvisy
observatory
of
flammarion
near
the
french
capital
listening
to
one
of
the
most
surprising
disclosures
of
a
secret
of
nature
that
any
ever
confided
to
a
few
trustworthy
friends
while
awaiting
a
suitable
time
to
make
it
public
it
was
a
secret
as
full
of
significance
as
that
which
galileo
concealed
for
a
time
in
his
celebrated
anagram
which
when
at
length
he
furnished
the
key
still
remained
a
riddle
for
then
it
read
the
mother
of
the
loves
imitates
the
shapes
of
cynthia
meaning
that
the
planet
venus
when
viewed
with
a
telescope
shows
phases
like
those
of
the
moon
the
secret
imparted
in
confidence
to
the
knot
of
astronomers
at
juvisy
came
from
a
countryman
of
galileo
signor
schiaparelli
the
director
of
the
observatory
of
milan
and
its
purport
was
that
the
planet
mercury
always
keeps
the
same
face
directed
toward
the
sun
schiaparelli
had
satisfied
himself
by
a
careful
series
of
observations
of
the
truth
of
his
strange
announcement
but
before
giving
it
to
the
world
he
determined
to
make
doubly
sure
early
in
he
withdrew
the
pledge
of
secrecy
from
his
friends
and
published
his
discovery
no
one
can
wonder
that
the
statement
was
generally
received
with
incredulity
for
it
was
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
conclusions
of
other
astronomers
who
had
long
believed
that
mercury
rotated
on
its
axis
in
a
period
closely
corresponding
with
that
of
the
rotation
that
is
to
say
once
every
hours
discovery
if
it
were
received
as
correct
would
put
mercury
as
a
planet
in
a
class
by
itself
and
would
distinguish
it
by
a
peculiarity
which
had
always
been
recognized
as
a
special
feature
of
the
moon
that
of
rotating
on
its
axis
in
the
same
period
of
time
required
to
perform
a
revolution
in
its
orbit
and
while
this
seemed
natural
enough
for
a
satellite
almost
nobody
was
prepared
for
the
ascription
of
such
eccentric
conduct
to
a
planet
the
italian
astronomer
based
his
discovery
upon
the
observation
that
certain
markings
visible
on
the
disk
of
mercury
remained
in
such
a
position
with
reference
to
the
direction
of
the
sun
as
to
prove
that
the
planet
rotation
was
extremely
slow
and
he
finally
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
but
one
rotation
in
the
course
of
a
revolution
about
the
sun
that
of
course
means
that
one
side
of
mercury
always
faces
toward
the
sun
while
the
opposite
side
always
faces
away
from
it
and
neither
side
experiences
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
one
having
perpetual
day
and
the
other
perpetual
night
the
older
observations
from
which
had
been
deduced
the
long
accepted
opinion
that
mercury
rotated
like
the
earth
once
in
about
hours
had
also
been
made
upon
the
markings
on
the
planet
disk
but
these
are
not
easily
seen
and
their
appearances
had
evidently
been
misinterpreted
the
very
fact
of
the
difficulty
of
seeing
any
details
on
mercury
tended
to
prevent
or
delay
corroboration
of
schiaparelli
discovery
but
there
were
two
circumstances
that
contributed
to
the
final
acceptance
of
his
results
one
of
these
was
his
experience
as
an
observer
and
the
high
reputation
that
he
enjoyed
among
astronomers
and
the
other
was
the
development
by
george
darwin
of
the
theory
of
tidal
friction
in
its
application
to
planetary
evolution
for
this
furnished
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
a
body
situated
as
near
the
sun
as
mercury
is
could
have
its
axial
rotation
gradually
reduced
by
the
tidal
attraction
of
the
sun
until
it
coincided
in
period
with
its
orbital
revolution
accepting
the
accuracy
of
schiaparelli
discovery
which
was
corroborated
in
every
particular
in
by
percival
lowell
in
a
special
series
of
observations
on
mercury
made
with
his
telescope
at
flagstaff
arizona
and
which
has
also
been
corroborated
by
others
we
see
at
once
how
important
is
its
bearing
on
the
habitability
of
the
planet
it
adds
another
difficulty
to
that
offered
by
the
remarkable
changes
of
distance
from
the
sun
and
consequent
variations
of
heat
which
we
have
already
discussed
in
order
to
bring
the
situation
home
to
our
experience
let
us
for
a
moment
imagine
the
earth
fallen
into
mercury
dilemma
there
would
then
be
no
succession
of
day
and
night
such
as
we
at
present
enjoy
and
upon
which
not
alone
our
comfort
but
perhaps
our
very
existence
depends
but
instead
one
side
of
our
globe
it
might
be
the
asiatic
or
the
american
half
would
be
continually
in
the
sunlight
and
the
other
side
would
lie
buried
in
endless
night
and
this
condition
so
suggestive
of
the
play
of
pure
imagination
this
plight
of
being
a
world
like
the
god
janus
one
face
light
and
the
other
face
dark
must
be
the
actual
state
of
things
on
mercury
there
is
one
interesting
qualification
in
the
case
just
imagined
for
the
earth
supposing
it
to
retain
the
present
inclination
of
its
axis
while
parting
with
its
differential
rotation
there
would
be
an
interchange
of
day
and
night
once
a
year
in
the
polar
regions
on
mercury
whose
axis
appears
to
be
perpendicular
a
similar
phenomenon
affecting
not
the
polar
regions
but
the
eastern
and
western
sides
of
the
planet
is
produced
by
the
extraordinary
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
as
the
planet
alternately
approaches
and
recedes
from
the
sun
its
orbital
velocity
as
we
have
already
remarked
varies
between
the
limits
of
and
miles
per
second
being
most
rapid
at
the
point
nearest
the
sun
but
this
variation
in
the
speed
of
its
revolution
about
the
sun
does
not
in
any
manner
affect
the
rate
of
rotation
on
its
axis
the
latter
is
perfectly
uniform
and
just
fast
enough
to
complete
one
axial
turn
in
the
course
of
a
single
revolution
about
the
sun
the
accompanying
figure
may
assist
the
explanation
illustration
diagram
showing
that
owing
to
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
and
its
varying
velocity
mercury
although
making
but
one
turn
on
its
axis
in
the
course
of
a
revolution
about
the
sun
nevertheless
experiences
on
parts
of
its
surface
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
let
us
start
with
mercury
in
perihelion
at
the
point
the
little
cross
on
the
planet
stands
exactly
under
the
sun
and
in
the
center
of
the
illuminated
hemisphere
the
large
arrows
show
the
direction
in
which
the
planet
travels
in
its
revolution
about
the
sun
and
the
small
curved
arrows
the
direction
in
which
it
rotates
on
its
axis
now
in
moving
along
its
orbit
from
to
the
planet
partly
because
of
its
swifter
motion
when
near
the
sun
and
partly
because
of
the
elliptical
nature
of
the
orbit
traverses
a
greater
angular
interval
with
reference
to
the
sun
than
the
cross
moving
with
the
uniform
rotation
of
the
planet
on
its
axis
is
able
to
traverse
in
the
same
time
as
drawn
in
the
diagram
the
cross
has
moved
through
exactly
ninety
degrees
or
one
right
angle
while
the
planet
in
its
orbit
has
moved
through
considerably
more
than
a
right
angle
in
consequence
of
this
gain
of
the
angle
of
revolution
upon
the
angle
of
rotation
the
cross
at
is
no
longer
exactly
under
the
sun
nor
in
the
center
of
the
illuminated
hemisphere
it
appears
to
have
shifted
its
position
toward
the
west
while
the
hemispherical
cap
of
sunshine
has
slipped
eastward
over
the
globe
of
the
planet
in
the
next
following
section
of
the
orbit
the
planet
rotates
through
another
right
angle
but
owing
to
increased
distance
from
the
sun
the
motion
in
the
orbit
now
becomes
slower
until
when
the
planet
arrives
at
aphelion
the
angular
difference
disappears
and
the
cross
is
once
more
just
under
the
sun
on
returning
from
aphelion
to
perihelion
the
same
phenomena
recur
in
reverse
order
and
the
line
between
day
and
night
on
the
planet
first
shifts
westward
attaining
its
limit
in
that
respect
at
and
then
at
perihelion
returns
to
its
original
position
now
if
we
could
stand
on
the
sunward
hemisphere
of
mercury
what
to
our
eyes
would
be
the
effect
of
this
shifting
of
the
sun
position
with
regard
to
a
fixed
point
on
the
planet
surface
manifestly
it
would
cause
the
sun
to
describe
a
great
arc
in
the
sky
swinging
to
and
fro
in
an
east
and
west
line
like
a
pendulum
bob
the
angular
extent
of
the
swing
being
a
little
more
than
degrees
and
the
time
required
for
the
sun
to
pass
from
its
extreme
eastern
to
its
extreme
western
position
and
back
again
being
days
but
owing
to
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
the
sun
swings
much
faster
toward
the
east
than
toward
the
west
the
eastward
motion
occupying
about
days
and

westward
motion

in
the

he
looks
down
on
its
north
pole
another
effect
of
the
libratory
motion
of
the
sun
as
seen
from
mercury
is
represented
in
the
next
figure
where
we
have
a
view
of
the
planet
showing
both
the
day
and
the
night
hemisphere
and
where
we
see
that
between
the
two
there
is
a
region
upon
which
the
sun
rises
and
sets
once
every
days
there
are
in
reality
two
of
these
regions
one
at
the
east
and
the
other
at
the
west
each
between
and
miles
broad
at
the
equator
at
the
sunward
edge
of
these
regions
once
in
days
or
once
in
a
mercurial
year
the
sun
rises
to
an
elevation
of
degrees
and
then
descends
again
straight
to
the
horizon
from
which
it
rose
at
the
nightward
edge
once
in
days
the
sun
peeps
above
the
horizon
and
quickly
sinks
from
sight
again
the
result
is
that
neglecting
the
effects
of
atmospheric
refraction
which
would
tend
to
expand
the
borders
of
the
domain
of
sunlight
about
one
quarter
of
the
entire
surface
of
mercury
is
with
regard
to
day
and
night
in
a
condition
resembling
that
of
our
polar
regions
where
there
is
but
one
day
and
one
night
in
the
course
of
a
year
and
on
mercury
a
year
is
days
one
half
of
the
remaining
three
quarters
of
the
planet
surface
is
bathed
in
perpetual
sunshine
and
the
other
half
is
a
region
of
eternal
night
and
now
again
what
of
life
in
such
a
world
as
that
on
the
night
side
where
no
sunshine
ever
penetrates
the
temperature
must
be
extremely
low
hardly
greater
than
the
fearful
cold
of
open
space
unless
modifying
influences
beyond
our
ken
exist
it
is
certain
that
if
life
flourishes
there
it
must
be
in
such
forms
as
can
endure
continual
darkness
and
excessive
cold
some
heat
would
be
carried
around
by
atmospheric
circulation
from
the
sunward
side
but
not
enough
it
would
seem
to
keep
water
from
being
perpetually
frozen
or
the
ground
from
being
baked
with
unrelaxing
frost
it
is
for
the
imagination
to
picture
underground
dwellings
artificial
sources
of
heat
and
living
forms
suited
to
unearthlike
environment
what
would
be
the
mental
effects
of
perpetual
night
upon
a
race
of
intelligent
creatures
doomed
to
that
condition
perhaps
not
quite
so
grievous
as
we
are
apt
to
think
the
constellations
in
all
their
splendor
would
circle
before
their
eyes
with
the
revolution
of
their
planet
about
the
sun
and
with
the
exception
of
the
sun
itself
which
they
could
see
by
making
a
journey
to
the
opposite
hemisphere
all
the
members
of
the
solar
system
would
pass
in
succession
through
their
and
two
of
them
would
present
themselves
with
a
magnificence
of
planetary
display
unknown
on
the
earth
venus
when
in
opposition
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
is
scarcely
more
than
miles
from
mercury
and
showing
herself
at
such
times
with
a
fully
illuminated
disk
as
owing
to
her
position
within
the
orbit
of
the
earth
she
never
can
do
when
at
her
least
distance
from
us
she
must
be
a
phenomenon
of
unparalleled
beauty
at
least
four
times
brighter
than
we
ever
see
her
and
capable
of
course
of
casting
a
strong
shadow
the
earth
also
is
a
splendid
star
in
the
midnight
sky
of
mercury
and
the
moon
may
be
visible
to
the
naked
eye
as
a
little
attendant
circling
about
its
brilliant
master
the
outer
planets
are
slightly
less
conspicuous
than
they
are
to
us
owing
to
increase
of
distance
the
revolution
of
the
heavens
as
seen
from
the
night
side
of
mercury
is
quite
different
in
period
from
that
which
we
are
accustomed
to
although
the
apparent
motion
is
in
the
same
direction
from
east
to
west
the
same
constellations
remain
above
the
horizon
for
weeks
at
a
time
slowly
moving
westward
with
the
planets
drifting
yet
more
slowly
but
at
different
rates
among
them
the
nearer
planets
venus
and
the
earth
showing
the
most
decided
tendency
to
loiter
behind
the
stars
on
the
side
where
eternal
sunlight
shines
the
sky
of
mercury
contains
no
stars
forever
the
pitiless
blaze
of
day
forever
all
in
a
hot
and
copper
sky
the
bloody
sun
at
noon
as
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
water
can
exist
on
the
night
hemisphere
except
in
the
shape
of
perpetual
snow
and
ice
so
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
on
the
day
hemisphere
water
can
ever
be
precipitated
from
the
vaporous
form
in
truth
there
can
be
very
little
water
on
mercury
even
in
the
form
of
vapor
else
the
spectroscope
would
have
given
unquestionable
evidence
of
its
presence
those
who
think
that
mercury
is
entirely
waterless
and
almost
if
not
quite
airless
may
be
right
in
these
respects
it
would
then
resemble
the
moon
and
according
to
some
observers
it
possesses
another
characteristic
lunar
feature
in
the
roughening
of
its
surface
by
what
seem
to
be
innumerable
volcanic
craters
but
if
we
suppose
mercury
to
possess
an
atmosphere
much
rarer
than
that
of
the
earth
we
may
perceive
therein
a
possible
provision
against
the
excessive
solar
heat
to
which
it
is
subjected
since
as
we
see
on
high
mountains
a
light
air
permits
a
ready
radiation
of
heat
which
does
not
become
stored
up
as
in
a
denser
atmosphere
as
the
sun
pours
its
heat
without
cessation
upon
the
day
hemisphere
the
warmed
air
must
rise
and
flow
off
on
all
sides
into
the
night
hemisphere
while
cold
air
rushes
in
below
to
take
its
place
from
the
region
of
frost
and
darkness
the
intermediate
areas
which
see
the
sun
part
of
the
time
as
explained
above
are
perhaps
the
scene
of
contending
winds
and
tempests
where
the
moisture
if
there
be
any
is
precipitated
through
the
rapid
cooling
of
the
air
in
whelming
floods
and
wild
driven
by
hurrying
blasts
from
the
realm
of
endless
night
enough
seems
now
to
have
been
said
to
indicate
clearly
the
hopelessness
of
looking
for
any
analogies
between
mercury
and
the
earth
which
would
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
former
planet
is
capable
of
supporting
inhabitants
or
forms
of
life
resembling
those
that
swarm
upon
the
latter
if
we
would
still
believe
that
mercury
is
a
habitable
globe
we
must
depend
entirely
upon
the
imagination
for
pictures
of
creatures
able
to
endure
its
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
of
light
and
darkness
of
instability
swift
vicissitude
and
violent
contrast
in
the
next
chapter
we
shall
study
a
more
peaceful
and
world
yet
one
of
great
brilliancy
which
possesses
some
remarkable
resemblances
to
the
earth
as
well
as
some
surprising
divergences
from
it
chapter
iii
venus
the
twin
of
the
earth
we
come
now
to
a
planet
which
seems
at
the
first
glance
to
afford
a
far
more
promising
outlook
than
mercury
does
for
the
presence
of
organic
life
forms
bearing
some
resemblance
to
those
of
the
earth
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
for
regarding
venus
as
a
world
much
like
ours
is
based
upon
its
remarkable
similarity
to
the
earth
in
size
and
mass
because
thus
we
are
assured
that
the
force
of
gravity
is
practically
the
same
upon
the
two
planets
and
the
force
of
gravity
governs
numberless
physical
phenomena
of
essential
importance
to
both
animal
and
vegetable
life
the
mean
diameter
of
the
earth
is
miles
that
of
venus
is
miles
the
difference
is
so
slight
that
if
the
two
planets
were
suspended
side
by
side
in
the
sky
at
such
a
distance
that
their
disks
resembled
that
of
the
full
moon
the
eye
would
notice
no
inequality
between
them
the
mean
density
of
venus
is
about
nine
tenths
of
that
of
the
earth
and
the
force
of
gravity
upon
its
surface
is
in
the
ratio
of
about
to
as
compared
to
its
force
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
a
man
removed
to
venus
would
consequently
find
himself
perceptibly
lighter
than
he
was
at
home
and
would
be
able
to
exert
his
strength
with
considerably
greater
effect
than
on
his
own
planet
but
the
difference
would
amount
only
to
an
agreeable
variation
from
accustomed
conditions
and
would
not
be
productive
of
fundamental
changes
in
the
order
of
nature
being
like
mercury
nearer
to
the
sun
than
the
earth
is
venus
also
is
visible
to
us
only
in
the
morning
or
the
evening
sky
but
her
distance
from
the
sun
slightly
exceeding
miles
is
nearly
double
that
of
mercury
so
that
when
favorably
situated
she
becomes
a
very
conspicuous
object
and
instead
of
being
known
almost
exclusively
by
astronomers
she
is
perhaps
the
most
popular
and
most
admired
of
all
the
members
of
the
planetary
system
especially
when
she
appears
in
the
charming
rôle
of
the
evening
star
as
she
emerges
periodically
from
the
blinding
glare
of
the
sun
immediate
neighborhood
and
begins
to
soar
bright
as
an
electric
balloon
in
the
twilight
she
commands
all
eyes
and
calls
forth
exclamations
of
astonishment
and
admiration
by
her
singular
beauty
the
intervals
between
her
successive
reappearances
in
the
evening
sky
measured
by
her
synodic
period
of
days
are
sufficiently
long
to
give
an
element
of
surprise
and
novelty
to
every
return
of
so
dazzling
a
phenomenon
even
the
light
of
the
full
moon
silvering
the
tree
tops
does
not
exercise
greater
enchantment
over
the
mind
of
the
contemplative
observer
in
either
of
her
rôles
as
morning
or
as
evening
star
venus
has
no
rival
no
fixed
star
can
for
an
instant
bear
comparison
with
her
what
she
lacks
in
vivacity
of
light
none
of
the
planets
twinkles
as
do
all
of
the
true
stars
is
more
than
compensated
by
the
imposing
size
of
her
gleaming
disk
and
the
striking
beauty
of
her
clear
lamplike
rays
her
color
is
silvery
or
golden
according
to
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
while
the
distinction
of
her
appearance
in
a
dark
sky
is
so
great
that
no
eye
can
resist
its
attraction
and
i
have
known
an
unexpected
glimpse
of
venus
to
put
an
end
to
an
animated
conversation
and
distract
for
a
long
time
the
attention
of
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
social
occupation
that
had
brought
them
together
as
a
telescopic
object
venus
is
exceedingly
attractive
even
when
considered
merely
from
the
point
of
view
of
simple
beauty
both
mercury
and
venus
as
they
travel
about
the
sun
exhibit
phases
like
those
of
the
moon
but
venus
being
much
larger
and
much
nearer
to
the
earth
than
mercury
shows
her
successive
phases
more
effectively
and
when
she
shines
as
a
thin
crescent
in
the
morning
or
evening
twilight
only
a
very
slight
magnifying
power
is
required
to
show
the
sickle
form
of
her
disk
a
remarkable
difference
between
venus
and
mercury
comes
out
as
soon
as
we
examine
the
shape
of
the
former
orbit
venus
mean
distance
from
the
sun
is
miles
and
her
orbit
is
so
nearly
a
circle
much
more
nearly
than
that
of
any
other
planet
that
in
the
course
of
a
revolution
her
distance
from
the
sun
varies
less
than
a
million
miles
the
distance
of
the
earth
varies
miles
and
that
of
mercury
her
period
of
revolution
or
the
length
of
her
year
is
of
our
days
when
she
comes
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
she
approaches
us
nearer
than
any
other
planet
ever
gets
except
the
asteroid
eros
her
distance
at
such
times
being
miles
or
about
one
hundred
and
ten
times
the
distance
of
the
moon
being
nearer
to
the
sun
in
the
ratio
of
to
venus
receives
almost
twice
as
much
solar
light
and
heat
as
we
get
but
less
than
one
third
as
much
as
mercury
gets
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
her
axis
instead
of
being
considerably
inclined
like
that
of
the
earth
is
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
her
orbit
thus
venus
introduces
to
us
another
novelty
in
the
economy
of
worlds
for
with
a
perpendicular
axis
of
rotation
she
can
have
no
succession
of
seasons
no
winter
and
summer
flitting
one
upon
the
other
heels
to
and
fro
between
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
but
on
the
contrary
her
climatic
conditions
must
be
unchangeable
and
on
any
particular
part
of
her
surface
except
for
local
causes
of
variation
the
weather
remains
the
same
the
year
around
so
as
far
as
temperature
is
concerned
venus
may
have
two
regions
of
perpetual
winter
one
around
each
pole
two
belts
of
perpetual
spring
in
the
upper
middle
latitudes
one
on
each
side
of
the
equator
and
one
zone
of
perpetual
summer
occupying
the
equatorial
portion
of
the
planet
but
of
course
these
seasonal
terms
do
not
strictly
apply
to
venus
in
the
sense
in
which
we
employ
them
on
the
earth
for
with
us
spring
is
characterized
rather
by
the
change
in
the
quantity
of
heat
and
other
atmospheric
conditions
that
it
witnesses
than
by
a
certain
fixed
and
invariable
temperature
to
some
minds
it
may
appear
very
undesirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
animate
existences
that
there
should
be
no
alternation
of
seasons
on
the
surface
of
a
planet
but
instead
fixed
conditions
of
climate
yet
it
is
not
clear
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
might
not
be
preferable
to
that
with
which
we
are
familiar
even
on
the
earth
we
find
that
tropical
regions
where
the
seasonal
changes
are
comparatively
moderate
present
many
attractions
and
advantages
in
contrast
with
the
violent
and
often
destructive
vicissitudes
of
the
temperate
zones
and
nature
has
shown
us
within
the
pale
of
our
own
planet
that
she
is
capable
of
bringing
forth
harvests
of
fruit
and
grain
without
the
stimulus
of
alternate
frost
and
sunshine
even
under
the
reign
of
perpetual
summer
the
fields
and
trees
find
time
and
opportunity
to
rest
and
restore
their
productive
forces
the
circularity
of
venus
orbit
and
the
consequently
insignificant
change
in
the
sun
distance
and
heating
effect
are
other
elements
to
be
considered
in
estimating
the
singular
constancy
in
the
operation
of
natural
agencies
upon
that
interesting
planet
which
twin
of
the
earth
though
it
be
in
stature
is
evidently
not
its
twin
in
temperament
and
next
as
to
the
question
of
atmosphere
in
what
precedes
the
presence
of
an
atmosphere
has
been
assumed
and
fortunately
there
is
very
convincing
evidence
both
visual
and
spectroscopic
that
venus
is
well
and
abundantly
supplied
with
air
by
which
it
is
not
meant
that
venus
air
is
precisely
like
the
mixture
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
with
a
few
other
gases
which
we
breathe
and
call
by
that
name
in
fact
there
are
excellent
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
atmosphere
of
venus
differs
from
the
earth
quite
as
much
as
some
of
her
other
characteristics
differ
from
those
of
our
planet
but
however
it
may
vary
from
ours
in
constitution
the
atmosphere
of
venus
contains
water
vapor
and
is
exceedingly
abundant
listen
to
professor
young
its
venus
atmosphere
is
probably
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
times
as
extensive
and
as
dense
as
our
own
and
the
spectroscope
shows
evidence
of
the
presence
of
water
vapor
in
it
and
william
pickering
basing
his
statement
on
the
result
of
observations
at
the
mountain
observatory
of
arequipa
says
we
may
feel
reasonably
certain
that
at
the
planet
venus
surface
the
density
of
its
atmosphere
is
many
times
that
of
our
own
we
do
not
have
to
depend
upon
the
spectroscope
for
evidence
that
venus
has
a
dense
atmosphere
for
we
can
in
a
manner
her
atmosphere
in
consequence
of
its
refractive
action
upon
the
sunlight
that
strikes
into
it
near
the
edge
of
the
planet
globe
this
illumination
of
venus
atmosphere
is
witnessed
both
when
she
is
nearly
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
and
when
being
exactly
between
them
she
appears
in
silhouette
against
the
solar
disk
during
a
transit
of
this
kind
in
many
observers
and
the
present
writer
was
one
saw
a
bright
atmospheric
bow
edging
a
part
of
the
circumference
of
venus
when
the
planet
was
moving
upon
the
face
of
the
sun
a
most
beautiful
and
impressive
spectacle
even
more
curious
is
an
observation
made
in
by
lyman
of
yale
college
who
when
venus
was
very
near
the
sun
saw
her
atmosphere
the
form
of
a
luminous
a
little
fuller
explanation
of
this
appearance
may
be
of
interest
when
approaching
inferior
conjunction
passing
between
the
earth
and
sun
venus
appears
with
a
telescope
in
the
shape
of
a
very
thin
crescent
professor
lyman
watched
this
crescent
becoming
narrower
day
after
day
as
it
approached
the
sun
and
noticed
that
its
extremities
gradually
extended
themselves
beyond
the
limits
of
a
semicircle
bending
to
meet
one
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
invisible
disk
of
the
planet
until
at
length
they
did
meet
and
he
beheld
a
complete
ring
of
silvery
light
all
that
remained
visible
of
the
planet
venus
the
ring
was
of
course
the
illuminated
atmosphere
of
the
planet
refracting
the
sunlight
on
all
sides
around
the
opaque
globe
in
flammarion
witnessed
the
same
phenomenon
in
similar
circumstances
one
may
well
envy
those
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
behold
this
spectacle
to
actually
see
as
it
were
the
air
that
the
inhabitants
of
another
world
are
breathing
and
making
resonant
with
all
the
multitudinous
sounds
and
voices
that
accompany
intelligent
life
but
perhaps
some
readers
will
prefer
to
think
that
even
though
an
atmosphere
is
there
there
is
no
one
to
breathe
it

venus
atmosphere
seen
as
a
ring
of
light
as
the
visibility
of
venus
atmosphere
is
unparalleled
elsewhere
in
the
solar
system
it
may
be
worth
while
to
give
a
graphic
illustration
of
it
in
the
accompanying
figure
the
planet
is
represented
at
three
successive
points
in
its
advance
toward
inferior
conjunction
as
it
approaches
conjunction
it
slowly
draws
nearer
the
earth
and
its
apparent
diameter
consequently
increases
at
a
large
part
of
the
luminous
crescent

composed
of
the
planet
surface
reflecting
the
sunshine
at
the
ratio
of
the
reflecting
surface
to
the
illuminated
atmosphere
has
diminished
and
the
latter
has
extended
like
the
curved
arms
of
a
pair
of
calipers
far
around
the
unilluminated
side
of
the
disk
at
the
atmosphere
is
illuminated
all
around
by
the
sunlight
coming
through
it
from
behind
while
the
surface
of
the
planet
has
passed
entirely
out
of
the
light
that
is
to
say
venus
has
become
an
invisible
globe
embraced
by
a
circle
of
refracted
sunshine
we
return
to
the
question
of
life
with
almost
twice
as
much
solar
heat
and
light
as
we
have
and
with
a
deeper
and
denser
atmosphere
than
ours
it
is
evident
without
seeking
other
causes
of
variation
that
the
conditions
of
life
upon
venus
are
notably
different
from
those
with
which
we
are
acquainted
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
that
a
dense
atmosphere
together
with
a
more
copious
supply
of
heat
might
render
the
surface
temperature
of
venus
unsuitable
for
organic
life
as
we
understand
it
but
so
much
depends
upon
the
precise
composition
of
the
atmosphere
and
upon
the
relative
quantities
of
its
constituents
that
it
will
not
do
to
pronounce
a
positive
judgment
in
such
a
case
because
we
lack
information
on
too
many
essential
points
experiment
has
shown
that
the
temperature
of
the
air
varies
with
changes
in
the
amount
of
carbonic
acid
and
of
water
vapor
that
it
contains
it
has
been
suggested
that
in
past
geologic
ages
the
earth
atmosphere
was
denser
and
more
heavily
charged
with
vapors
than
it
is
at
present
yet
even
then
forms
of
life
suited
to
their
environment
existed
and
from
those
forms
the
present
inhabitants
of
our
globe
have
been
developed
there
are
several
lines
of
reasoning
which
may
be
followed
to
the
conclusion
that
venus
as
a
world
is
younger
than
the
earth
and
according
to
that
view
we
are
at
liberty
to
imagine
our
beautiful
sister
planet
as
now
passing
through
some
such
period
in
its
history
as
that
at
which
the
earth
had
arrived
in
the
age
of
the
carboniferous
forests
or
the
age
of
the
gigantic
reptiles
who
ruled
both
land
and
sea
but
without
making
any
assumptions
as
to
the
phase
of
evolution
which
life
may
have
attained
on
venus
it
is
also
possible
to
think
that
the
planet
thick
shell
of
air
with
its
abundant
vapors
may
serve
as
a
shield
against
the
excessive
solar
radiation
venus
is
extraordinarily
brilliant
its
reflective
power
being
greatly
in
excess
of
mercury
and
it
has
often
been
suggested
that
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
a
large
share
of
the
sunlight
falling
upon
it
is
turned
back
before
reaching
the
planet
surface
being
reflected
both
from
the
atmosphere
itself
and
from
vast
layers
of
clouds
even
when
viewed
with
the
most
powerful
telescopes
and
in
the
most
favoring
circumstances
the
features
of
venus
surface
are
difficult
to
see
and
generally
extremely
difficult
they
consist
of
faint
shadowy
markings
indefinite
in
outline
and
so
close
to
the
limit
of
visibility
that
great
uncertainty
exists
not
only
as
to
their
shape
and
their
precise
location
upon
the
planet
but
even
as
to
their
actual
existence
no
two
observers
have
represented
them
exactly
alike
in
drawings
of
the
planet
and
unfortunately
photography
is
as
yet
utterly
unable
to
deal
with
them
percival
lowell
in
his
special
studies
of
venus
in
using
a
telescope
of
great
excellence
in
the
clear
and
steady
air
of
arizona
found
delicate
spokelike
streaks
radiating
from
a
rounded
spot
like
a
hub
and
all
of
which
in
his
opinion
were
genuine
and
definite
markings
on
the
planet
surface
but
others
using
larger
telescopes
have
failed
to
perceive
the
shapes
and
details
depicted
by
lowell
and
some
are
disposed
to
ascribe
their
appearances
to
venus
atmosphere
lowell
himself
noticed
that
the
markings
seemed
to
have
a
kind
of
obscuring
veil
over
them
in
short
all
observers
of
venus
agree
in
thinking
that
her
atmosphere
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
serves
as
a
mask
to
conceal
her
real
features
and
the
possibilities
of
so
extensive
an
atmosphere
with
reference
to
an
adjustment
of
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
planet
to
the
requirements
of
life
upon
it
are
almost
unlimited
if
we
could
accurately
analyze
that
atmosphere
we
would
have
a
basis
for
more
exact
conclusions
concerning
venus
habitability
but
the
mere
existence
of
the
atmosphere
is
in
itself
a
strong
argument
for
the
habitability
of
the
planet
and
as
to
the
temperature
we
are
really
not
compelled
to
imagine
special
adaptations
by
means
of
which
it
may
be
brought
into
accord
with
that
prevailing
upon
the
earth
as
long
as
the
temperature
does
not
rise
to
the
point
beyond
which
our
experience
teaches
that
no
organic
life
can
exist
it
may
very
well
attain
an
elevation
that
would
mean
extreme
discomfort
from
our
point
of
view
without
precluding
the
existence
of
life
even
in
its
terrestrial
sense
and
would
it
not
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
vital
phenomena
on
other
planets
must
be
subject
to
exactly
the
same
limitations
that
we
find
circumscribing
them
in
our
world
that
kind
of
assumption
has
more
than
once
led
us
far
astray
even
in
dealing
with
terrestrial
conditions
it
is
not
so
long
ago
for
instance
since
life
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
was
deemed
to
be
demonstrably
impossible
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
we
were
assured
was
a
region
of
eternal
darkness
and
of
frightful
pressure
wherein
no
living
creatures
could
exist
yet
the
first
dip
of
the
trawl
brought
up
animals
of
marvelous
delicacy
of
organization
which
although
curiously
and
wonderfully
adapted
to
live
in
a
compressed
liquid
collapsed
when
lifted
into
a
lighter
medium
and
which
despite
the
assumed
perpetual
darkness
of
their
profound
abode
were
adorned
with
variegated
colors
and
furnished
with
organs
of
phosphorescence
whereby
they
could
create
for
themselves
all
the
light
they
needed
even
the
fixed
animals
of
the
sea
growing
like
plants
fast
to
the
rocks
are
frequently
vivid
with
living
light
and
there
is
a
splendid
suggestion
of
nature
powers
of
adaptation
which
may
not
be
entirely
inapplicable
to
the
problems
of
life
on
strange
planets
in
alexander
agassiz
statement
that
species
of
sea
animals
living
below
the
depths
to
which
sunlight
penetrates
may
dwell
in
total
darkness
and
be
illuminated
at
times
merely
by
the
movements
of
abyssal
fishes
through
the
forests
of
phosphorescent
alcyonarians
in
attempting
to
judge
the
habitability
of
a
planet
such
as
venus
we
must
first
as
far
as
possible
generalize
the
conditions
that
govern
life
and
restrict
its
boundaries
on
the
earth
we
find
animated
existence
confined
to
the
surface
of
the
crust
of
the
globe
to
the
lower
and
denser
strata
of
the
atmosphere
and
to
the
film
of
water
that
constitutes
the
oceans
it
does
not
exist
in
the
heart
of
the
rocks
forming
the
body
of
the
planet
nor
in
the
void
of
space
surrounding
it
outside
the
atmosphere
as
the
earth
condensed
from
the
original
nebula
and
cooled
and
solidified
a
certain
quantity
of
matter
remained
at
its
surface
in
the
form
of
free
gases
and
unstable
compounds
and
within
the
narrow
precincts
where
these
things
were
lying
like
a
thin
shell
between
the
huge
inert
globe
of
permanently
combined
elements
below
and
the
equally
unchanging
realm
of
the
ether
above
life
a
phenomenon
depending
upon
ceaseless
changes
combinations
and
recombinations
of
chemical
elements
in
unstable
and
temporary
union
made
its
appearance
and
there
only
we
find
it
at
the
present
time
it
is
because
air
and
water
furnish
the
means
for
the
continual
transformations
by
which
the
bodies
of
animals
and
plants
are
built
up
and
afterward
disintegrated
and
dispersed
that
we
are
compelled
to
regard
their
presence
as
prerequisites
to
the
existence
on
any
planet
of
life
in
any
of
the
forms
in
which
we
are
acquainted
with
it
but
if
we
perceive
that
another
world
has
an
atmosphere
and
that
there
is
water
vapor
in
its
atmosphere
both
of
which
conditions
are
fulfilled
by
venus
and
if
we
find
that
that
world
is
bathed
in
the
same
sunshine
that
stimulates
the
living
forces
of
our
planet
even
though
its
quantity
or
intensity
may
be
different
then
it
would
seem
that
we
are
justified
in
averring
that
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
those
who
would
deny
the
capability
of
such
a
world
to
support
inhabitants
the
generally
accepted
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
the
solar
system
leads
us
to
believe
that
venus
has
experienced
the
same
process
of
evolution
as
that
which
brought
the
earth
into
its
present
condition
and
we
may
fairly
argue
that
upon
the
rocky
shell
of
venus
exists
a
region
where
chemical
combinations
and
recombinations
like
those
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
are
taking
place
it
is
surely
not
essential
that
the
elements
should
exist
in
exactly
the
same
states
and
proportions
as
upon
the
earth
it
is
enough
if
some
of
them
are
manifestly
present
even
on
the
earth
these
things
have
undergone
much
variation
in
the
course
of
geological
history
coincidently
with
the
development
of
various
species
of
life
just
at
present
the
earth
appears
to
have
reached
a
stage
where
everything
contributes
to
the
maintenance
of
a
very
high
organization
in
both
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
so
each
planet
that
has
attained
the
habitable
stage
may
have
a
typical
adjustment
of
temperature
and
atmospheric
constitution
rendering
life
possible
within
certain
limits
peculiar
to
that
planet
and
to
the
special
conditions
prevailing
there
admitting
as
there
is
reason
for
doing
that
different
planets
may
be
at
different
stages
of
development
in
the
geological
and
biological
sense
we
should
of
course
not
expect
to
find
them
inhabited
by
the
same
living
species
and
since
there
is
also
reason
to
believe
that
no
two
planets
upon
arriving
at
the
same
stage
of
evolution
as
globes
would
possess
identical
gaseous
surroundings
there
would
naturally
be
differences
between
their
organic
life
forms
notwithstanding
the
similarity
of
their
common
phase
of
development
in
other
respects
thus
a
departure
from
the
terrestrial
type
in
the
envelope
of
gases
covering
a
planet
instead
of
precluding
life
would
only
tend
to
vary
its
manifestations
after
all
why
should
the
intensity
of
the
solar
radiation
upon
venus
be
regarded
as
inimical
to
life
the
sunbeams
awaken
life
it
is
not
impossible
that
relative
nearness
to
the
sun
may
be
an
advantage
to
venus
from
the
biologic
point
of
view
she
gets
less
than
one
third
as
much
heat
as
mercury
receives
on
the
average
and
she
gets
it
with
almost
absolute
uniformity
at
aphelion
mercury
is
about
two
and
four
tenths
times
hotter
than
venus
then
it
rushes
sunward
and
within
days
becomes
six
times
hotter
than
venus
in
the
meantime
the
temperature
of
the
latter
while
high
as
compared
with
the
earth
remains
practically
unchanged
not
only
may
mercury
temperature
reach
the
destructive
point
and
thus
be
too
high
for
organic
life
but
mercury
gets
nothing
with
either
moderation
or
constancy
it
is
a
world
both
of
excessive
heat
and
of
violent
contrasts
of
temperature
venus
on
the
other
hand
presents
an
unparalleled
instance
of
invariableness
and
uniformity
she
may
well
be
called
the
favorite
of
the
sun
and
through
the
advantages
of
her
situation
may
be
stimulated
by
him
to
more
intense
vitality
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
earth
it
is
open
at
least
to
the
writers
of
the
interplanetary
romances
now
so
popular
to
imagine
that
on
venus
life
while
encompassed
with
the
serenity
that
results
from
the
circular
form
of
her
orbit
and
the
unchangeableness
of
her
climates
is
richer
warmer
more
passionate
more
exquisite
in
its
forms
and
more
fascinating
in
its
experiences
keener
of
sense
capable
of
more
delicious
joys
than
is
possible
to
it
amid
the
manifold
inclemencies
of
the
colder
earth
we
have
seen
that
there
is
excellent
authority
for
saying
that
atmosphere
is
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
times
as
dense
and
as
extensive
as
ours
here
is
an
interesting
suggestion
of
aerial
possibilities
for
her
inhabitants
if
man
could
but
fly
how
would
he
take
to
himself
wings
and
widen
his
horizons
along
with
the
birds
give
him
an
atmosphere
the
double
in
density
of
that
which
now
envelopes
him
take
off
a
little
of
his
weight
thereby
increasing
the
ratio
of
his
strength
and
activity
put
into
his
nervous
system
a
more
puissant
stimulus
from
the
sun
and
perchance
he
fly
well
on
venus
apparently
these
very
conditions
actually
exist
how
then
do
intellectual
creatures
in
the
world
of
venus
take
wing
when
they
choose
upon
what
spectacle
of
fluttering
pinions
afloat
in
iridescent
air
like
a
raphael
dream
of
heaven
and
its
angels
might
we
not
look
down
if
we
could
get
near
enough
to
our
brilliant
evening
star
to
behold
the
intimate
splendors
of
its
life
as
venus
herself
would
be
the
most
brilliant
member
of
the
celestial
host
to
an
observer
stationed
on
the
night
side
of
mercury
so
the
earth
takes
precedence
in
the
midnight
sky
of
venus
for
the
inhabitants
of
venus
mercury
is
a
splendid
evening
and
morning
star
only
while
the
earth
being
an
outer
planet
is
visible
at
times
in
that
part
of
the
sky
which
is
directly
opposite
to
the
place
of
the
sun
the
light
reflected
from
our
planet
is
probably
less
dazzling
than
that
which
venus
sends
to
us
both
because
at
our
greater
distance
the
sunlight
is
less
intense
and
because
our
rarer
atmosphere
reflects
a
smaller
proportion
of
the
rays
incident
upon
it
but
the
earth
is
after
all
a
more
brilliant
phenomenon
seen
from
venus
than
the
latter
is
seen
from
the
earth
for
the
reason
that
the
entire
illuminated
disk
of
the
earth
is
presented
toward
our
sister
planet
when
the
two
are
at
their
nearest
point
of
approach
whereas
at
that
time
the
larger
part
of
the
surface
of
venus
that
is
turned
earthward
has
no
illumination
while
the
illuminated
portion
is
a
mere
crescent
owing
again
to
the
comparative
rarity
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
it
is
probable
that
the
inhabitants
of
venus
assuming
their
existence
enjoy
a
superb
view
of
the
continents
oceans
polar
snows
and
passing
clouds
that
color
and
variegate
the
face
of
the
earth
our
astronomers
can
study
the
full
disk
of
venus
only
when
she
is
at
her
greatest
distance
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sun
from
us
where
she
is
half
concealed
in
the
glare
the
astronomers
of
venus
on
the
other
hand
can
study
the
earth
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
of
observation
that
is
to
say
when
it
is
nearest
to
them
and
when
being
in
opposition
to
the
sun
its
whole
disk
is
fully
illuminated
in
fact
there
is
no
planet
in
the
entire
system
which
enjoys
an
outlook
toward
a
sister
world
comparable
with
that
which
venus
enjoys
with
regard
to
the
earth
if
there
be
astronomers
upon
venus
armed
with
telescopes
it
is
safe
to
guess
that
they
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
far
exceeding
in
minuteness
and
accuracy
the
knowledge
that
we
possess
of
the
features
of
any
heavenly
body
except
the
moon
they
must
long
ago
have
been
able
to
form
definite
conclusions
concerning
the
meteorology
and
the
probable
habitability
of
our
planet
it
certainly
tends
to
increase
our
interest
in
venus
when
granting
that
she
is
inhabited
we
reflect
upon
the
penetrating
scrutiny
of
which
the
earth
may
be
the
object
whenever
venus
as
happens
once
every
days
passes
between
us
and
the
sun
the
spectacle
of
our
great
planet
glowing
in
its
fullest
splendor
in
the
midnight
sky
pied
and
streaked
with
water
land
cloud
and
snow
is
one
that
might
well
excite
among
the
astronomers
of
another
world
so
fortunately
placed
to
observe
it
an
interest
even
greater
than
that
which
the
recurrence
of
total
solar
eclipses
occasions
upon
the
earth
for
the
inhabitants
of
venus
the
study
of
the
earth
must
be
the
most
absorbing
branch
of
observational
astronomy
and
the
subject
we
may
imagine
of
numberless
volumes
of
learned
memoirs
far
exceeding
in
the
definiteness
of
their
conclusions
the
books
that
we
have
written
about
the
physical
characteristics
of
other
members
of
the
solar
system
and
if
we
are
to
look
for
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
other
worlds
to
communicate
with
us
by
signals
across
the
ether
it
would
certainly
seem
that
venus
is
the
most
likely
source
of
such
efforts
for
from
no
other
planet
can
those
features
of
the
earth
that
give
evidence
of
its
habitability
be
so
clearly
discerned
of
one
thing
it
would
seem
we
may
be
certain
if
venus
has
intellectual
inhabitants
they
possess
far
more
convincing
evidence
of
our
existence
than
we
are
likely
ever
to
have
of
theirs
in
referring
to
the
view
of
the
earth
from
mercury
it
was
remarked
that
the
moon
is
probably
visible
to
the
naked
eye
from
venus
the
moon
is
not
only
visible
but
conspicuous
to
the
naked
eye
circling
about
the
earth
and
appearing
at
times
to
recede
from
it
to
a
distance
of
about
half
a
degree
equal
to
the
diameter
of
the
full
moon
as
we
see
it
the
disk
of
the
earth
is
not
quite
four
times
greater
in
diameter
than
that
of
the
moon
and
nowhere
else
in
the
solar
system
is
there
an
instance
in
which
two
bodies
no
more
widely
different
in
size
than
are
the
moon
and
the
earth
are
closely
linked
together
the
moons
of
the
other
planets
that
possess
satellites
are
relatively
so
small
that
they
appear
in
the
telescope
as
mere
specks
beside
their
primaries
but
the
moon
is
so
large
as
compared
with
the
earth
that
the
two
must
appear
as
viewed
from
venus
like
a
double
planet
to
the
naked
eye
they
may
look
like
a
very
wide
and
brilliant
double
star
probably
of
contrasted
colors
the
moon
being
silvery
white
and
the
earth
perhaps
now
of
a
golden
or
reddish
tinge
and
now
green
or
blue
according
to
the
part
of
its
surface
turned
toward
venus
and
according
also
to
the
season
that
chances
to
be
reigning
over
that
part
such
a
spectacle
could
not
fail
to
be
of
absorbing
interest
and
we
can
not
admit
the
possibility
of
intelligent
inhabitants
on
venus
without
supposing
them
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
moon
and
the
earth
with
the
utmost
intentness
the
passage
of
the
moon
behind
and
in
front
of
the
earth
and
its
eclipses
when
it
goes
into
the
earth
shadow
could
be
seen
without
the
aid
of
telescopes
while
with
such
instruments
these
phenomena
would
possess
the
highest
scientific
interest
and
importance
because
the
earth
has
a
satellite
so
easily
observable
the
astronomers
of
venus
could
not
remain
ignorant
of
the
exact
mass
of
our
planet
and
in
that
respect
they
would
outstrip
us
in
the
race
for
knowledge
since
on
account
of
the
lack
of
a
satellite
attending
venus
we
have
been
able
to
do
no
more
than
make
an
approximate
estimate
of
her
mass
with
telescopes
too
in
the
case
of
a
solar
eclipse
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
earth
opposition
they
could
see
the
black
spot
formed
by
the
shadow
of
the
moon
where
the
end
of
its
cone
moved
across
the
earth
like
the
point
of
an
invisible
pencil
and
could
watch
it
traversing
continents
and
oceans
or
thrown
out
in
bold
contrast
upon
the
white
background
of
a
great
area
of
clouds
indeed
the
phenomena
which
our
globe
and
its
satellite
present
to
venus
must
be
so
varied
and
wonderful
that
one
might
well
wish
to
visit
that
planet
merely
for
the
sake
of
beholding
them
thus
far
we
have
found
so
much
of
brilliant
promise
in
the
earth
twin
sister
that
i
almost
hesitate
to
approach
another
phase
of
the
subject
which
may
tend
to
weaken
the
faith
of
some
readers
in
the
habitability
of
venus
it
may
have
been
observed
that
heretofore
nothing
has
been
said
as
to
the
planet
rotation
period
but
without
specifically
mentioning
it
i
have
tacitly
assumed
the
correctness
of
the
generally
accepted
period
of
about
hours
determined
by
de
vico
and
other
observers
this
period
closely
accordant
with
the
earth
is
as
far
as
it
goes
another
argument
for
the
habitability
of
venus
but
now
it
must
be
stated
that
no
less
eminent
an
authority
than
schiaparelli
holds
that
venus
as
well
as
mercury
makes
but
a
single
turn
on
its
axis
in
the
course
of
a
revolution
about
the
sun
and
consequently
is
a
world
one
side
staring
eternally
at
the
sun
and
the
other
side
wearing
the
black
mask
of
endless
night
schiaparelli
made
this
announcement
concerning
venus
but
a
few
weeks
after
publishing
his
discovery
of
mercury
peculiar
rotation
he
himself
appears
to
be
equally
confident
in
both
cases
of
the
correctness
of
his
conclusions
and
the
certainty
of
his
observation
as
with
mercury
several
other
observers
have
corroborated
him
and
particularly
percival
lowell
in
this
country
lowell
indeed
seems
unwilling
to
admit
that
any
doubt
can
be
entertained
nevertheless
very
grave
doubt
is
entertained
and
that
by
many
and
probably
by
the
majority
of
the
leading
professional
astronomers
and
observers
in
fact
some
observers
of
great
ability
equipped
with
powerful
instruments
have
directly
contradicted
the
results
of
schiaparelli
and
his
supporters
the
reader
may
ask
why
so
readily
accept
schiaparelli
conclusions
with
regard
to
mercury
while
rejecting
them
in
the
case
of
venus
the
reply
is
twofold
in
the
first
place
the
markings
on
venus
although
lowell
sketched
them
with
perfect
confidence
in
are
by
the
almost
unanimous
testimony
of
those
who
have
searched
for
them
with
telescopes
both
large
and
small
extremely
difficult
to
see
indistinct
in
outline
and
perhaps
evanescent
in
character
the
sketches
of
no
two
observers
agree
and
often
they
are
remarkably
unlike
the
fact
has
already
been
mentioned
that
lowell
noticed
a
kind
of
veil
partially
obscuring
the
markings
and
which
he
ascribed
no
doubt
correctly
to
the
planet
atmosphere
but
he
thinks
that
notwithstanding
the
atmospheric
veil
the
markings
noted
by
him
were
unquestionably
permanent
features
of
the
planet
real
surface
inasmuch
however
as
his
drawings
represent
things
entirely
different
from
what
others
have
seen
there
seems
to
be
weight
in
the
suggestion
that
the
radiating
bands
and
shadings
noticed
by
him
were
in
some
manner
illusory
and
perhaps
of
atmospheric
origin
if
the
markings
were
evidently
of
a
permanent
nature
and
attached
to
the
solid
shell
of
the
planet
and
if
they
were
of
sufficient
distinctness
to
be
seen
in
substantially
the
same
form
by
all
observers
armed
with
competent
instruments
then
whatever
conclusion
was
drawn
from
their
apparent
motion
as
to
the
period
of
the
planet
rotation
would
have
to
be
accepted
in
the
case
of
mercury
the
markings
while
not
easily
seen
appear
to
be
sufficiently
distinct
to
afford
confidence
in
the
result
of
observations
based
upon
them
but
venus
markings
have
been
represented
in
so
many
different
ways
that
it
seems
advisable
to
await
more
light
before
accepting
any
extraordinary
and
in
itself
improbable
conclusion
based
upon
them
it
should
also
be
added
that
in
spectroscopic
observations
by
belopolski
at
pulkova
gave
evidence
that
venus
really
rotates
rapidly
on
her
axis
in
a
period
probably
approximating
to
the
hours
of
the
earth
rotation
thus
corroborating
the
older
conclusions
belopolski
observation
it
may
be
remarked
was
based
upon
what
is
known
as
the
doppler
principle
which
is
employed
in
measuring
the
motion
of
stars
in
the
line
of
sight
and
in
other
cases
of
rapidly
moving
sources
of
light
according
to
this
principle
when
a
source
of
light
either
original
or
reflected
is
approaching
the
observer
the
characteristic
lines
in
its
spectrum
are
shifted
toward
the
blue
end
and
when
it
is
retreating
from
the
observer
the
lines
are
shifted
toward
the
red
end
now
in
the
case
of
a
planet
rotating
rapidly
on
its
axis
it
is
clear
that
if
the
observer
is
situated
in
or
nearly
in
the
plane
of
the
planet
equator
one
edge
of
its
disk
will
be
approaching
his
eye
while
the
opposite
edge
is
retreating
and
the
lines
in
the
spectrum
of
a
beam
of
light
from
the
advancing
edge
will
be
shifted
toward
the
blue
while
those
in
the
spectrum
of
the
light
coming
from
the
retreating
edge
will
be
shifted
toward
the
red
and
by
carefully
noting
the
amount
of
the
shifting
the
velocity
of
the
planet
rotation
can
be
computed
this
is
what
was
done
by
belopolski
in
the
case
of
venus
with
the
result
above
noted
secondly
the
theory
that
venus
rotates
but
once
in
the
course
of
a
revolution
finds
but
slight
support
from
the
doctrine
of
tidal
friction
as
compared
with
that
which
it
receives
when
applied
to
mercury
the
effectiveness
of
the
sun
attraction
in
slowing
down
the
rotation
of
a
planet
through
the
braking
action
of
the
tides
raised
in
the
body
of
the
planet
while
it
is
yet
molten
or
plastic
varies
inversely
as
the
sixth
power
of
the
planet
distance
for
mercury
this
effectiveness
is
nearly
three
hundred
times
as
great
as
it
is
for
the
earth
while
for
venus
it
is
only
seven
times
as
great
while
we
may
admit
then
that
mercury
being
relatively
close
to
the
sun
and
subject
to
an
enormous
braking
action
lost
rotation
until
as
occurred
for
a
similar
reason
to
the
moon
under
the
tidal
attraction
of
the
earth
it
ended
by
keeping
one
face
always
toward
its
master
we
are
not
prepared
to
make
the
same
admission
in
the
case
of
venus
where
the
effective
force
concerned
is
comparatively
so
slight
it
should
be
added
however
that
no
certain
evidence
of
polar
compression
in
the
outline
of
venus
disk
has
ever
been
obtained
and
this
fact
would
favor
the
theory
of
a
very
slow
rotation
because
a
plastic
globe
in
swift
rotation
has
its
equatorial
diameter
increased
and
its
polar
diameter
diminished
if
venus
were
as
much
flattened
at
the
poles
as
the
earth
is
it
would
seem
that
the
fact
could
not
escape
detection
yet
the
necessary
observations
are
very
difficult
and
venus
is
so
brilliant
that
her
light
increases
the
difficulty
while
her
transits
across
the
sun
when
she
can
be
seen
as
a
round
black
disk
are
very
rare
phenomena
the
latest
having
occurred
in
and
and
the
next
not
being
due
until
upon
the
whole
probably
the
best
method
of
settling
the
question
of
venus
rotation
is
the
spectroscopic
method
and
that
as
we
saw
has
already
given
evidence
for
the
short
period
even
if
it
were
established
that
venus
keeps
always
the
same
face
to
the
sun
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
abandon
altogether
the
belief
that
she
is
habitable
although
of
course
the
obstacles
to
that
belief
would
be
increased
venus
orbit
being
so
nearly
circular
and
her
orbital
motion
so
nearly
invariable
she
has
but
a
very
slight
libration
with
reference
to
the
sun
and
the
east
and
west
lunes
on
her
surface
where
day
and
night
would
alternate
once
in
her
year
of
days
would
be
so
narrow
as
to
be
practically
negligible
but
owing
to
her
extensive
atmosphere
there
would
be
a
very
broad
band
of
twilight
on
venus
running
entirely
around
the
planet
at
the
inner
edge
of
the
light
hemisphere
what
the
meteorological
conditions
within
this
zone
would
be
is
purely
a
matter
of
conjecture
as
in
the
case
of
mercury
we
should
expect
an
interchange
of
atmospheric
currents
between
the
light
and
dark
sides
of
the
planet
the
heated
air
rising
under
the
influence
of
the
unsetting
sun
in
one
hemisphere
and
being
replaced
by
an
indraught
of
cold
air
from
the
other
the
twilight
band
would
probably
be
the
scene
of
atmospheric
conflicts
and
storms
and
of
immense
precipitation
if
there
were
oceans
on
the
light
hemisphere
to
charge
the
air
with
moisture
it
has
been
suggested
that
ice
and
snow
might
be
piled
in
a
vast
circle
of
glaciers
belting
the
planet
along
the
line
between
perpetual
day
and
night
and
that
where
the
sunbeams
touched
these
icy
deposits
near
the
edge
of
the
light
hemisphere
a
marvelous
spectacle
of
prismatic
hills
of
crystal
would
be
presented
it
may
be
remarked
that
it
would
be
the
inhabitants
of
the
dark
hemisphere
who
would
enjoy
the
beautiful
scene
of
the
earth
and
the
moon
in
opposition
chapter
iv
mars
a
world
more
advanced
than
ours
mars
is
the
fourth
planet
in
the
order
of
distance
from
the
sun
and
the
outermost
member
of
the
terrestrial
group
its
mean
distance
is
miles
variable
through
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
to
the
extent
of
about
miles
it
will
be
observed
that
this
is
only
a
million
miles
less
than
the
variation
in
mercury
distance
from
the
sun
from
which
in
a
previous
chapter
were
deduced
most
momentous
consequences
but
in
the
case
of
mars
the
ratio
of
the
variation
to
the
mean
distance
is
far
smaller
than
with
mercury
so
that
the
effect
upon
the
temperature
of
the
planet
is
relatively
insignificant
mars
gets
a
little
less
than
half
as
much
solar
light
and
heat
as
the
earth
receives
its
situation
in
this
respect
being
just
the
opposite
to
that
of
venus
its
period
of
orbital
revolution
or
the
length
of
its
year
is
of
our
days
the
diameter
of
mars
is
miles
and
its
density
is
per
cent
of
the
earth
density
gravity
on
its
surface
is
only
per
cent
of
terrestrial
gravity
a
one
weight
removed
from
the
earth
to
mars
would
there
weigh
but
pounds
mars
evidently
has
an
atmosphere
the
details
of
which
we
shall
discuss
later
the
poles
of
the
planet
are
inclined
from
a
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
at
very
nearly
the
same
angle
as
that
of
the
earth
poles
its
rotation
on
its
axis
is
also
effected
in
almost
the
same
period
as
the
earth
hours
minutes
when
in
opposition
to
the
sun
mars
may
be
only
about
miles
from
the
earth
but
its
average
distance
when
in
that
position
is
more
than
miles
and
may
be
more
than
these
differences
arise
from
the
eccentricities
of
the
orbits
of
the
two
planets
when
on
the
farther
side
of
the
sun
in
conjunction
with
the
sun
as
seen
from
the
earth
mars
average
distance
from
us
is
about
miles
in
consequence
of
these
great
changes
in
its
distance
mars
is
sometimes
a
very
conspicuous
object
in
the
sky
and
at
other
times
inconspicuous
the
similarity
in
the
inclination
of
the
axis
of
the
two
planets
results
in
a
close
resemblance
between
the
seasons
on
mars
and
on
the
earth
although
owing
to
the
greater
length
of
its
year
mars
seasons

winter
and
summer
visit
in
succession
its
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
just
as
occurs
on
the
planet
that
we
inhabit
and
the
torrid
temperate
and
frigid
zones
on
its
surface
have
nearly
the
same
angular
width
as
on
the

in
this
respect
mars
is
the
first
of
the
foreign
planets
we
have
studied
to
resemble
the
earth
around
each
of
its
poles
appears
a
circular
white
patch
which
visibly
expands
when
winter
prevails
upon
it
and
rapidly
contracts
sometimes
almost
completely
disappearing
under
a
summer
sun
from
the
time
of
sir
william
herschel
the
almost
universal
belief
among
astronomers
has
been
that
these
gleaming
polar
patches
on
mars
are
composed
of
snow
and
ice
like
the
similar
glacial
caps
of
the
earth
and
no
one
can
look
at
them
with
a
telescope
and
not
feel
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
planet
to
which
they
belong
for
they
impart
to
it
an
appearance
of
likeness
to
our
globe
which
at
first
glance
is
all
but
irresistible
to
watch
one
of
them
apparently
melting
becoming
perceptibly
smaller
week
after
week
while
the
general
surface
of
the
corresponding
hemisphere
of
the
planet
deepens
in
color
and
displays
a
constantly
increasing
wealth
of
details
as
summer
advances
across
it
is
an
experience
of
the
most
memorable
kind
whose
effect
upon
the
mind
of
the
observer
is
indescribable
early
in
the
history
of
the
telescope
it
became
known
that
in
addition
to
the
polar
caps
mars
presented
a
number
of
distinct
surface
features
and
gradually
as
instruments
increased
in
power
and
observers
in
skill
charts
of
the
planet
were
produced
showing
a
surface
diversified
somewhat
in
the
manner
that
characterizes
the
face
of
the
earth
although
the
permanent
forms
do
not
closely
resemble
those
of
our
planet
two
principal
colors
exist
on
the
disk
of
mars
dark
bluish
gray
or
greenish
gray
characterizing
areas
which
have
generally
been
regarded
as
seas
and
light
yellowish
red
overspreading
broad
regions
looked
upon
as
continents
it
was
early
observed
that
if
the
dark
regions
really
are
seas
the
proportion
of
water
to
land
upon
mars
is
much
smaller
than
upon
the
earth
for
two
especial
reasons
mars
has
generally
been
regarded
as
an
older
or
more
advanced
planet
than
the
earth
the
first
reason
is
that
accepting
laplace
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
planetary
system
from
a
series
of
rings
left
off
at
the
periphery
of
the
contracting
solar
nebula
mars
must
have
come
into
existence
earlier
than
the
earth
because
being
more
distant
from
the
center
of
the
system
the
ring
from
which
it
was
formed
would
have
been
separated
sooner
than
the
terrestrial
ring
the
second
reason
is
that
mars
being
smaller
and
less
massive
than
the
earth
has
run
through
its
developments
a
cooling
globe
more
rapidly
the
bearing
of
these
things
upon
the
problems
of
life
on
mars
will
be
considered
hereafter
and
now
once
more
schiaparelli
appears
as
the
discoverer
of
surprising
facts
about
one
of
the
most
interesting
worlds
of
the
solar
system
during
the
exceptionally
favorable
opposition
of
mars
in
when
an
american
astronomer
asaph
hall
discovered
the
planet
two
minute
satellites
and
again
during
the
opposition
of
the
italian
observer
caught
sight
of
an
astonishing
network
of
narrow
dark
lines
intersecting
the
continental
regions
of
the
planet
and
crossing
one
another
in
every
direction
schiaparelli
did
not
see
the
little
moons
that
hall
discovered
and
hall
did
not
perceive
the
enigmatical
lines
that
schiaparelli
detected
hall
had
by
far
the
larger
and
more
powerful
telescope
schiaparelli
had
much
the
more
steady
and
favorable
atmosphere
for
astronomical
observation
yet
these
differences
in
equipment
and
circumstances
do
not
clearly
explain
why
each
observer
should
have
seen
what
the
other
did
not
there
may
be
a
partial
explanation
in
the
fact
that
an
observer
having
made
a
remarkable
discovery
is
naturally
inclined
to
confine
his
attention
to
it
to
the
neglect
of
other
things
but
it
was
soon
found
that
schiaparelli
lines
to
which
he
gave
the
name
canals
merely
on
account
of
their
shape
and
appearance
and
without
any
intention
to
define
their
real
nature
were
excessively
difficult
telescopic
objects
eight
or
nine
years
elapsed
before
any
other
observer
corroborated
schiaparelli
observations
and
notwithstanding
the
sensation
which
the
discovery
of
the
canals
produced
they
were
for
many
years
regarded
by
the
majority
of
astronomers
as
an
illusion
but
they
were
no
illusion
and
in
schiaparelli
added
to
the
astonishment
created
by
his
original
discovery
and
furnished
additional
grounds
for
skepticism
by
announcing
that
at
certain
times
many
of
the
canals
geminated
or
became
double
he
continued
his
observations
at
each
subsequent
opposition
adding
to
the
number
of
the
canals
observed
and
charting
them
with
classical
names
upon
a
detailed
map
of
the
planet
surface
at
length
in
perrotin
at
nice
detected
many
of
canals
and
later
they
were
seen
by
others
in
schiaparelli
greatly
extended
his
observations
and
in
and
some
of
the
canals
were
studied
with
the
telescope
of
the
lick
observatory
and
in
the
year
a
very
elaborate
series
of
observations
upon
them
was
made
by
percival
lowell
and
his
associates
william
pickering
and
douglass
at
flagstaff
arizona
lowell
charts
of
the
planet
are
the
most
complete
yet
produced
containing
canals
to
which
separate
names
have
been
given
besides
more
than
a
hundred
other
markings
also
designated
by
individual
appellations
it
should
not
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
schiaparelli
discovery
in
excited
so
much
surprise
and
incredulity
that
no
glimpse
of
the
peculiar
markings
on
mars
had
been
obtained
earlier
than
that
at
least
as
long
ago
as
dawes
in
england
had
seen
and
sketched
half
a
dozen
of
the
larger
canals
or
at
least
the
broader
parts
of
them
especially
where
they
connect
with
the
dark
regions
known
as
seas
but
dawes
did
not
see
them
in
their
full
extent
did
not
recognize
their
peculiar
character
and
entirely
failed
to
catch
sight
of
the
narrower
and
more
numerous
ones
which
constitute
the
wonderful
network
discovered
by
the
italian
astronomer
schiaparelli
found
no
less
than
sixty
canals
during
his
first
series
of
observations
in
let
us
note
some
of
the
more
striking
facts
about
the
canals
which
schiaparelli
has
described
we
can
not
do
better
than
quote
his
own
words
there
are
on
this
planet
traversing
the
continents
long
dark
lines
which
may
be
designated
as
although
we
do
not
yet
know
what
they
are
these
lines
run
from
one
to
another
of
the
somber
spots
that
are
regarded
as
seas
and
form
over
the
lighter
or
continental
regions
a
network
their
arrangement
appears
to
be
invariable
and
permanent
at
least
as
far
as
i
can
judge
from
four
and
a
half
years
of
observation
nevertheless
their
aspect
and
their
degree
of
visibility
are
not
always
the
same
and
depend
upon
circumstances
which
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
does
not
yet
permit
us
to
explain
with
certainty
in
a
great
number
were
seen
which
were
not
visible
in
and
in
all
those
which
had
been
seen
at
former
oppositions
were
found
again
together
with
new
ones
sometimes
these
canals
present
themselves
in
the
form
of
shadowy
and
vague
lines
while
on
other
occasions
they
are
clear
and
precise
like
a
trace
drawn
with
a
pen
in
general
they
are
traced
upon
the
sphere
like
the
lines
of
great
circles
a
few
show
a
sensible
lateral
curvature
they
cross
one
another
obliquely
or
at
right
angles
they
have
a
breadth
of
two
degrees
or
kilometres
miles
and
several
extend
over
a
length
of
eighty
degrees
or
kilometres
nearly
miles
their
tint
is
very
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
seas
usually
a
little
lighter
every
canal
terminates
at
both
its
extremities
in
a
sea
or
in
another
canal
there
is
not
a
single
example
of
one
coming
to
an
end
in
the
midst
of
dry
land
this
is
not
all
in
certain
seasons
these
canals
become
double
this
phenomenon
seems
to
appear
at
a
determinate
epoch
and
to
be
produced
simultaneously
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
planet
continents
there
was
no
indication
of
it
in
during
the
weeks
that
preceded
and
followed
the
summer
solstice
of
that
world
a
single
isolated
case
presented
itself
in
on
the
of
december
this
year
a
little
before
the
spring
equinox
which
occurred
on
mars
on
the
of
january
i
noticed
the
doubling
of
the
nile
a
canal
thus
named
between
the
lakes
of
the
moon
and
the
ceraunic
gulf
these
two
regular
equal
and
parallel
lines
caused
me
i
confess
a
profound
surprise
the
more
so
because
a
few
days
earlier
on
the
and
the
of
december
i
had
carefully
observed
that
very
region
without
discovering
anything
of
the
kind
i
awaited
with
curiosity
the
return
of
the
planet
in
to
see
if
an
analogous
phenomenon
would
present
itself
in
the
same
place
and
i
saw
the
same
thing
reappear
on
the
of
january
one
month
after
the
spring
equinox
which
occurred
on
the
of
december
the
duplication
was
still
more
evident
at
the
end
of
february
on
this
same
date
the
of
january
another
duplication
had
already
taken
place
that
of
the
middle
portion
of
the
canal
of
the
cyclops
adjoining
elysium
elysium
is
a
part
of
one
of
the
continental
areas
yet
greater
was
my
astonishment
when
on
the
of
january
i
saw
the
canal
jamuna
which
was
then
in
the
center
of
the
disk
formed
very
rigidly
of
two
parallel
straight
lines
crossing
the
space
which
separates
the
niliac
lake
from
the
gulf
of
aurora
at
first
sight
i
believed
it
was
an
illusion
caused
by
fatigue
of
the
eye
and
some
new
kind
of
strabismus
but
i
had
to
yield
to
the
evidence
after
the
of
january
i
simply
passed
from
wonder
to
wonder
successively
the
orontes
the
euphrates
the
phison
the
ganges
and
the
larger
part
of
the
other
canals
displayed
themselves
very
clearly
and
indisputably
duplicated
there
were
not
less
than
twenty
examples
of
duplication
of
which
seventeen
were
observed
in
the
space
of
a
month
from
the
of
january
to
the
of
february
in
certain
cases
it
was
possible
to
observe
precursory
symptoms
which
are
not
lacking
in
interest
thus
on
the
of
january
a
light
shade
extended
alongside
the
ganges
on
the
and
the
one
could
only
distinguish
a
series
of
white
spots
on
the
the
shadow
was
still
indecisive
but
on
the
the
duplication
was
perfectly
clear
such
as
i
observed
it
until
the
of
february
the
duplication
of
the
euphrates
of
the
canal
of
the
titans
and
of
the
pyriphlegethon
also
began
in
an
uncertain
and
nebulous
form
these
duplications
are
not
an
optical
effect
depending
on
increase
of
visual
power
as
happens
in
the
observation
of
double
stars
and
it
is
not
the
canal
itself
splitting
in
two
longitudinally
here
is
what
is
seen
to
the
right
or
left
of
a
line
without
any
change
in
the
course
and
position
of
that
line
one
sees
another
line
produce
itself
equal
and
parallel
to
the
first
at
a
distance
generally
varying
from
six
to
twelve
degrees
from
to
kilometres
to
miles
even
closer
ones
seem
to
be
produced
but
the
telescope
is
not
powerful
enough
to
distinguish
them
with
certainty
their
tint
appears
to
be
a
quite
deep
reddish
brown
the
parallelism
is
sometimes
rigorously
exact
there
is
nothing
analogous
in
terrestrial
geography
everything
indicates
that
here
there
is
an
organization
special
to
the
planet
mars
probably
connected
with
the
course
of
its
seasons
footnote
vol
i
pp
schiaparelli
adds
that
he
took
every
precaution
to
avoid
the
least
suspicion
of
illusion
i
am
absolutely
sure
he
says
of
what
i
have
observed
i
have
quoted
his
statement
especially
about
the
duplication
of
the
canals
at
so
much
length
both
on
account
of
its
intrinsic
interest
and
because
it
has
many
times
been
argued
that
this
particular
phenomenon
must
be
illusory
even
though
the
canals
are
real
one
of
the
most
significant
facts
that
came
out
in
the
early
observations
was
the
evident
connection
between
the
appearance
of
the
canals
and
the
seasonal
changes
on
mars
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
spring
equinox
when
the
white
polar
caps
had
begun
to
melt
that
schiaparelli
first
noticed
the
phenomenon
of
duplication
as
the
season
advanced
the
doubling
of
the
canals
increased
in
frequency
and
the
lines
became
more
distinct
in
the
meantime
the
polar
caps
were
becoming
smaller
broadly
speaking
schiaparelli
observation
showed
that
the
doubling
of
the
canals
occurred
principally
a
little
after
the
spring
equinox
and
a
little
before
the
autumn
equinox
that
the
phenomenon
disappeared
in
large
part
at
the
epoch
of
the
winter
solstice
and
disappeared
altogether
at
the
epoch
of
the
summer
solstice
moreover
he
observed
that
many
of
the
canals
without
regard
to
duplication
were
invisible
at
times
and
reappeared
gradually
faint
scarcely
visible
lines
and
shadows
deepened
and
became
more
distinct
until
they
were
clearly
and
sharply
defined
and
these
changes
likewise
were
evidently
seasonal
the
invariable
connection
of
the
canals
at
their
terminations
with
the
regions
called
seas
the
fact
that
as
the
polar
caps
disappeared
the
sealike
expanses
surrounding
the
polar
regions
deepened
in
color
and
other
similar
considerations
soon
led
to
the
suggestion
that
there
existed
on
mars
a
wonderful
system
of
water
circulation
whereby
the
melting
of
the
polar
snows
as
summer
passed
alternately
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
served
to
reenforce
the
supply
of
water
in
the
seas
and
through
the
seas
in
the
canals
traversing
the
broad
expanses
of
dry
land
that
occupy
the
equatorial
regions
of
the
planet
the
thought
naturally
occurred
that
the
canals
might
be
of
artificial
origin
and
might
indicate
the
existence
of
a
gigantic
system
of
irrigation
serving
to
maintain
life
upon
the
globe
of
mars
the
geometrical
perfection
of
the
lines
their
straightness
their
absolute
parallelism
when
doubled
their
remarkable
tendency
to
radiate
from
definite
centers
lent
strength
to
the
hypothesis
of
an
artificial
origin
but
their
enormous
size
length
and
number
tended
to
stagger
belief
in
the
ability
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
world
to
achieve
a
work
so
stupendous
after
a
time
a
change
of
view
occurred
concerning
the
nature
of
the
expanses
called
seas
and
lowell
following
his
observations
of
developed
the
theory
of
the
water
circulation
and
irrigation
of
mars
in
a
new
form
he
and
others
observed
that
occasionally
canals
were
visible
cutting
straight
across
some
of
the
greenish
or
areas
that
had
been
regarded
as
seas
this
fact
suggested
that
instead
of
seas
these
dark
expanses
may
rather
be
areas
of
marshy
ground
covered
with
vegetation
which
flourishes
and
dies
away
according
as
the
supply
of
water
alternately
increases
and
diminishes
while
the
reddish
areas
known
as
continents
are
barren
deserts
intersected
by
canals
and
as
the
water
released
by
the
melting
of
the
polar
snows
begins
to
fill
the
canals
vegetation
springs
up
along
their
sides
and
becomes
visible
in
the
form
of
long
narrow
bands
according
to
this
theory
the
phenomena
called
canals
are
simply
lines
of
vegetation
the
real
canals
being
individually
too
small
to
be
detected
it
may
be
supposed
that
from
a
central
supply
canal
irrigation
ditches
are
extended
for
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
miles
on
each
side
thus
producing
a
strip
of
fertile
soil
from
forty
to
sixty
miles
wide
and
hundreds
or
in
some
cases
two
or
three
thousands
of
miles
in
length
the
water
supply
being
limited
the
inhabitants
can
not
undertake
to
irrigate
the
entire
surface
of
the
thirsty
land
and
convenience
of
circulation
induces
them
to
extend
the
irrigated
areas
in
the
form
of
long
lines
the
surface
of
mars
according
to
lowell
observation
is
remarkably
flat
and
level
so
that
no
serious
obstacle
exists
to
the
extension
of
the
canal
system
in
straight
bands
as
undeviating
as
arcs
of
great
circles
wherever
two
or
more
canals
meet
or
cross
a
rounded
dark
spot
from
a
hundred
miles
or
less
to
three
hundred
miles
in
diameter
is
seen
an
astonishing
number
of
these
appear
on
lowell
charts
occasionally
as
occurs
at
the
singular
spot
named
lacus
solis
several
canals
converging
from
all
points
of
the
compass
meet
at
a
central
point
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
in
other
cases
as
for
instance
that
of
the
long
canal
named
eumenides
with
its
continuation
orcus
a
single
conspicuous
line
is
seen
threading
a
large
number
of
round
dark
spots
which
present
the
appearance
of
a
row
of
beads
upon
a
string
these
circular
spots
which
some
have
regarded
as
lakes
lowell
believes
are
rather
oases
in
the
great
deserts
and
granting
the
correctness
of
his
theory
of
the
canals
the
aptness
of
this
designation
is
apparent
footnote
the
reader
can
find
many
of
these
canals
and
oases
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
regions
on
mars
that
have
received
names
in
the
frontispiece
wherever
several
canals
that
is
to
say
several
bands
of
vegetation
or
bands
of
life
meet
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
an
irrigated
and
habitable
area
of
considerable
extent
will
be
developed
and
in
such
places
the
imagination
may
picture
the
location
of
the
chief
centers
of
population
perhaps
in
the
form
of
large
cities
or
perhaps
in
groups
of
smaller
towns
and
villages
the
lacus
solis
is
one
of
these
localities
so
likewise
it
seems
but
natural
that
along
the
course
of
a
broad
band
a
number
of
expansions
should
occur
driving
back
the
bounds
of
the
desert
forming
rounded
areas
of
vegetation
and
thus
affording
a
footing
for
population
wherever
two
bands
cross
such
areas
would
be
sure
to
exist
and
in
almost
every
instance
of
crossing
the
telescope
actually
shows
them
as
to
the
gemination
or
duplication
of
many
of
the
lines
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
appear
single
it
may
be
suggested
that
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
the
vast
irrigation
system
of
the
planet
parallel
bands
of
cultivation
have
been
established
one
receiving
its
water
supply
from
the
canals
of
the
other
and
consequently
lagging
a
little
behind
in
visibility
as
the
water
slowly
percolates
through
the
soil
and
awakens
the
vegetation
or
else
the
character
of
the
vegetation
itself
may
differ
as
between
two
such
parallel
bands
one
being
supplied
with
plants
that
spring
up
and
mature
quickly
when
the
soil
about
their
roots
is
moistened
while
the
plants
in
the
twin
band
respond
more
slowly
to
stimulation
objection
has
been
made
to
the
theory
of
the
artificial
origin
of
the
canals
of
mars
on
the
ground
already
mentioned
that
the
work
required
to
construct
them
would
be
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
race
of
creatures
resembling
man
the
reply
that
has
been
made
to
this
is
twofold
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
theory
as
lowell
presents
it
does
not
assert
that
the
visible
lines
are
the
actual
canals
but
only
that
they
are
strips
of
territory
intersected
like
holland
or
the
center
of
the
plain
of
lombardy
by
innumerable
irrigation
canals
and
ditches
to
construct
such
works
is
clearly
not
an
impossible
undertaking
although
it
does
imply
great
industry
and
concentration
of
effort
in
the
second
place
since
the
force
of
gravity
on
mars
is
in
the
ratio
of
only
to
compared
with
the
earth
it
is
evident
that
the
diminished
weight
of
all
bodies
to
be
handled
would
give
the
inhabitants
of
mars
an
advantage
over
those
of
the
earth
in
the
performance
of
manual
labor
provided
that
they
possess
physical
strength
and
activity
as
great
as
ours
but
in
consequence
of
this
very
fact
of
the
slighter
force
of
gravity
a
man
upon
mars
could
attain
a
much
greater
size
and
consequently
much
greater
muscular
strength
than
his
fellows
upon
the
earth
possess
without
being
oppressed
by
his
own
weight
in
other
words
as
far
as
the
force
of
gravity
may
be
considered
as
the
decisive
factor
mars
could
be
inhabited
by
giants
fifteen
feet
tall
who
would
be
relatively
just
as
active
and
just
as
little
impeded
in
their
movements
by
the
weight
of
their
bodies
as
a
is
upon
the
earth
but
they
would
possess
far
more
physical
strength
than
we
do
while
in
doing
work
they
would
have
much
lighter
materials
to
deal
with
whether
the
theory
that
the
canals
of
mars
really
are
canals
is
true
or
not
at
any
rate
there
can
now
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
the
strange
lines
which
bear
that
designation
the
suggestion
has
been
offered
that
their
builders
may
no
longer
be
in
existence
mars
having
already
passed
the
point
in
its
history
where
life
must
cease
upon
its
surface
this
brings
us
to
consider
again
the
statement
made
near
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
that
mars
is
perhaps
at
a
more
advanced
stage
of
development
than
the
earth
if
we
accept
this
view
then
provided
there
was
originally
some
resemblance
between
mars
life
forms
and
those
of
the
earth
the
inhabitants
of
that
planet
would
at
every
step
probably
be
in
front
of
their
terrestrial
rivals
so
that
at
the
present
time
they
should
stand
well
in
advance
lowell
has
perhaps
put
this
view
of
the
relative
advancement
in
evolution
of
mars
and
its
inhabitants
as
picturesquely
as
anybody
in
mars
he
says
we
have
before
us
the
spectacle
of
a
world
relatively
well
on
in
years
a
world
much
older
than
the
earth
to
so
much
about
his
age
mars
bears
witness
on
his
face
he
shows
unmistakable
signs
of
being
old
advancing
planetary
years
have
left
their
mark
legible
there
his
continents
are
all
smoothed
down
his
oceans
have
all
dried
up
mars
being
thus
old
himself
we
know
that
evolution
on
his
surface
must
be
similarly
advanced
this
only
informs
us
of
its
condition
relative
to
the
planet
capabilities
of
its
actual
state
our
data
are
not
definite
enough
to
furnish
much
deduction
but
from
the
fact
that
our
own
development
has
been
comparatively
a
recent
thing
and
that
a
long
time
would
be
needed
to
bring
even
mars
to
his
present
geological
condition
we
may
judge
any
life
he
may
support
to
be
not
only
relatively
but
really
older
than
our
own
from
the
little
we
can
see
such
appears
to
be
the
case
the
evidence
of
handicraft
if
such
it
be
points
to
a
highly
intelligent
mind
behind
it
irrigation
unscientifically
conducted
would
not
give
us
such
truly
wonderful
mathematical
fitness
in
the
several
parts
to
the
whole
as
we
there
behold
quite
possibly
such
martian
folk
are
possessed
of
inventions
of
which
we
have
not
dreamed
and
with
them
electrophones
and
kinetoscopes
are
things
of
a
bygone
past
preserved
with
veneration
in
museums
as
relics
of
the
clumsy
contrivances
of
the
simple
childhood
of
the
race
certainly
what
we
see
hints
at
the
existence
of
beings
who
are
in
advance
of
not
behind
us
in
the
journey
of
life
footnote
mars
by
percival
lowell
granted
the
existence
of
such
a
race
as
is
thus
described
and
to
them
it
might
not
seem
a
too
appalling
enterprise
when
their
planet
had
become
decrepit
with
its
atmosphere
thinned
out
and
its
supply
of
water
depleted
to
grapple
with
the
destroying
hand
of
nature
and
to
prolong
the
career
of
their
world
by
feats
of
chemistry
and
engineering
as
yet
beyond
the
compass
of
human
knowledge
it
is
confidence
bred
from
considerations
like
these
in
the
superhuman
powers
of
the
supposed
inhabitants
of
mars
that
has
led
to
the
popular
idea
that
they
are
trying
to
communicate
by
signals
with
the
earth
certain
enigmatical
spots
of
light
seen
at
the
edge
of
the
illuminated
disk
of
mars
and
projecting
into
the
unilluminated
part
for
mars
although
an
outer
planet
shows
at
particular
times
a
gibbous
phase
resembling
that
of
the
moon
just
before
or
just
after
the
period
of
full
moon
have
been
interpreted
by
some
but
without
any
scientific
evidence
as
of
artificial
origin
upon
the
assumption
that
these
bright
points
and
others
occasionally
seen
elsewhere
on
the
planet
disk
are
intended
by
the
martians
for
signals
to
the
earth
entertaining
calculations
have
been
made
as
to
the
quantity
of
light
that
would
be
required
in
the
form
of
a
flash
signal
to
be
visible
across
the
distance
separating
the
two
planets
the
results
of
the
calculations
have
hardly
been
encouraging
to
possible
investors
in
interplanetary
telegraphy
since
it
appears
that
heliographic
mirrors
with
reflecting
surfaces
measured
by
square
miles
instead
of
square
inches
would
be
required
to
send
a
visible
beam
from
the
earth
to
mars
or
the
projections
of
light
on
mars
can
be
explained
much
more
simply
and
reasonably
various
suggestions
have
been
made
about
them
among
others
that
they
are
masses
of
cloud
reflecting
the
sunshine
that
they
are
areas
of
snow
and
that
they
are
the
summits
of
mountains
crowned
with
ice
and
encircled
with
clouds
in
fact
a
huge
mountain
mass
lying
on
the
terminator
or
the
line
between
day
and
night
would
produce
the
effect
of
a
tongue
of
light
projecting
into
the
darkness
without
assuming
that
it
was
or
capped
with
clouds
as
any
one
may
convince
himself
by
studying
the
moon
with
a
telescope
when
the
terminator
lies
across
some
of
its
most
mountainous
regions
to
be
sure
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
surface
of
mars
is
remarkably
flat
yet
even
so
the
planet
may
have
some
mountains
and
on
a
globe
the
greater
part
of
whose
shell
is
smooth
any
projections
would
be
conspicuous
particularly
where
the
sunlight
fell
at
a
low
angle
across
them
another
form
in
which
the
suggestion
of
interplanetary
communication
has
been
urged
is
plainly
an
outgrowth
of
the
invention
and
surprising
developments
of
wireless
telegraphy
the
human
mind
is
so
constituted
that
whenever
it
obtains
any
new
glimpse
into
the
arcana
of
nature
it
immediately
imagines
an
indefinite
and
all
but
unlimited
extension
of
its
view
in
that
direction
so
to
many
it
has
not
appeared
unreasonable
to
assume
that
since
it
is
possible
to
transmit
electric
impulses
for
considerable
distances
over
the
earth
surface
by
the
simple
propagation
of
a
series
of
waves
or
undulations
without
connecting
wires
it
may
also
be
possible
to
send
such
impulses
through
the
ether
from
planet
to
planet
the
fact
that
the
electric
undulations
employed
in
wireless
telegraphy
pass
between
stations
connected
by
the
crust
of
the
earth
itself
and
immersed
in
a
common
atmospheric
envelope
is
not
deemed
by
the
supporters
of
the
theory
in
question
as
a
very
serious
objection
for
they
contend
electric
waves
are
a
phenomenon
of
the
ether
which
extends
throughout
space
and
given
sufficient
energy
such
waves
could
cross
the
gap
between
world
and
world
but
nobody
has
shown
how
much
energy
would
be
needed
for
such
a
purpose
and
much
less
has
anybody
indicated
a
way
in
which
the
required
energy
could
be
artificially
developed
or
cunningly
filched
from
the
stores
of
nature
it
is
then
purely
an
assumption
an
interesting
figment
of
the
mind
that
certain
curious
disturbances
in
the
electrical
state
of
the
air
and
the
earth
affecting
delicate
electric
instruments
possessing
a
marked
periodicity
in
brief
intervals
of
time
and
not
yet
otherwise
accounted
for
are
due
to
the
throbbing
in
the
ether
of
impulses
transmitted
from
instruments
controlled
by
the
of
mars
whose
insatiable
thirst
for
knowledge
and
presumably
burning
desire
to
learn
whether
there
is
not
within
reach
some
more
fortunate
world
than
their
globe
has
led
them
into
a
desperate
attempt
to
call
up
the
earth
on
their
interplanetary
telephone
with
the
hope
that
we
are
wise
and
skilful
enough
to
understand
and
answer
them
in
what
language
they
intend
to
converse
no
one
has
yet
undertaken
to
tell
but
the
suggestion
has
sapiently
been
made
that
mathematical
facts
being
invariable
the
eternal
equality
of
two
plus
two
with
four
might
serve
as
a
basis
of
understanding
and
that
a
statement
of
that
truth
sent
by
electric
taps
across
the
ocean
of
ether
would
be
a
convincing
assurance
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
planet
from
which
the
message
came
at
least
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
a
education
but
while
speculation
upon
this
subject
rests
on
unverified
and
at
present
unverifiable
assumptions
of
course
everybody
would
rejoice
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
for
consider
what
zest
and
charm
would
be
added
to
human
life
if
messages
even
of
the
simplest
description
could
be
sent
to
and
received
from
intelligent
beings
inhabiting
other
planets
it
is
because
of
this
hold
that
it
possesses
upon
the
imagination
and
the
pleasing
pictures
that
it
conjures
up
that
the
idea
of
interplanetary
communication
once
broached
has
become
so
popular
a
topic
even
though
everybody
sees
that
it
should
not
be
taken
too
seriously
the
subject
of
the
atmosphere
of
mars
can
not
be
dismissed
without
further
consideration
than
we
have
yet
given
it
because
those
who
think
the
planet
uninhabitable
base
their
opinion
largely
upon
the
assumed
absence
of
sufficient
air
to
support
life
it
was
long
ago
recognized
that
other
things
being
equal
a
planet
of
small
mass
must
possess
a
less
dense
atmosphere
than
one
of
large
mass
assuming
that
each
planet
originally
drew
from
a
common
stock
and
that
the
amount
and
density
of
its
atmosphere
is
measured
by
its
force
of
gravity
it
can
be
shown
that
mars
should
have
an
atmosphere
less
than
one
fifth
as
dense
as
the
earth
johnstone
stoney
has
attacked
the
problem
of
planetary
atmospheres
in
another
way
knowing
the
force
of
gravity
on
a
planet
it
is
easy
to
calculate
the
velocity
with
which
a
body
or
a
particle
would
have
to
start
radially
from
the
planet
in
order
to
escape
from
its
gravitational
control
for
the
earth
this
critical
velocity
is
about
seven
miles
per
second
for
mars
about
three
miles
per
second
estimating
the
velocity
of
the
molecules
of
the
various
atmospheric
gases
according
to
the
kinetic
theory
stoney
finds
that
some
of
the
smaller
planets
and
the
moon
are
gravitationally
incapable
of
retaining
all
of
these
gases
in
the
form
of
an
atmosphere
among
the
atmospheric
constituents
that
according
to
this
view
mars
would
be
unable
permanently
to
retain
is
water
vapor
indeed
he
supposes
that
even
the
earth
is
slowly
losing
its
water
by
evaporation
into
space
and
on
mars
owing
to
the
slight
force
of
gravity
there
this
process
would
go
on
much
more
rapidly
so
that
in
this
way
we
have
a
means
of
accounting
for
the
apparent
drying
up
of
that
planet
while
we
may
be
led
to
anticipate
that
at
some
time
in
the
remote
future
the
earth
also
will
begin
to
suffer
from
lack
of
water
and
that
eventually
the
chasms
of
the
sea
will
yawn
empty
and
desolate
under
a
cloudless
sky
but
it
is
not
certain
that
the
original
supply
of
atmospheric
elements
was
in
every
case
proportional
to
the
respective
force
of
gravity
of
a
planet
the
fact
that
venus
appears
to
have
an
atmosphere
more
extensive
and
denser
than
the
earth
although
its
force
of
gravity
is
a
little
less
than
that
of
our
globe
indicates
at
once
a
variation
as
between
these
two
planets
in
the
amount
of
atmospheric
material
at
their
disposal
this
may
be
a
detail
depending
upon
differences
in
the
mode
or
in
the
stage
of
their
evolution
thus
after
all
theory
may
be
substantially
correct
and
yet
mars
may
retain
sufficient
water
to
form
clouds
to
be
precipitated
in
snow
and
to
fill
its
canals
after
each
annual
melting
of
the
polar
caps
because
the
original
supply
was
abundant
and
its
escape
is
a
gradual
process
only
to
be
completed
by
steps
even
though
the
evidence
of
the
spectroscope
as
far
as
it
goes
seems
to
lend
support
to
the
theory
that
there
is
no
water
vapor
in
the
atmosphere
of
mars
we
can
not
disregard
the
visual
evidence
that
nevertheless
water
vapor
exists
there
what
are
the
polar
caps
if
they
are
not
snow
frozen
carbon
dioxide
it
has
been
suggested
but
this
is
hardly
satisfactory
for
it
offers
no
explanation
of
the
fact
that
when
the
polar
caps
diminish
and
in
proportion
as
they
diminish
the
seas
and
the
canals
darken
and
expand
whereas
a
reasonable
explanation
of
the
correlation
of
these
phenomena
is
offered
if
we
accept
the
view
that

a

of

thin
veils

such
as
would
be

to
form
in
an
atmosphere
so
comparatively
rare
as
that
of

clouds
in
some
instances
at
least
appear

douglass
one
of
lowell
associates
in
the
observations
of
at
flagstaff
arizona
observed
what
he
believed
to
be
a
cloud
over
the
unilluminated
part
of
mars
disk
which
by
micrometric
measurement
and
estimate
was
drifting
at
an
elevation
of
about
fifteen
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
this
was
seen
on
two
successive
days
november
and
november
and
it
underwent
curious
fluctuations
in
visibility
besides
moving
in
a
northerly
direction
at
the
rate
of
some
thirteen
miles
an
hour
but
upon
the
whole
as
lowell
remarks
the
atmosphere
of
mars
is
remarkably
free
of
clouds
the
reader
will
remember
that
mars
gets
a
little
less
than
half
as
much
heat
from
the
sun
as
the
earth
gets
this
fact
also
has
been
used
as
an
argument
against
the
habitability
of
the
planet
in
truth
those
who
think
that
life
in
the
solar
system
is
confined
to
the
earth
alone
insist
upon
an
almost
exact
reproduction
of
terrestrial
conditions
as
a
qua
to
the
habitability
of
any
other
planet
venus
they
think
is
too
hot
and
mars
too
cold
as
if
life
were
rather
a
happy
accident
than
the
result
of
the
operation
of
general
laws
applicable
under
a
wide
variety
of
conditions
all
that
we
are
really
justified
in
asserting
is
that
venus
may
be
too
hot
and
mars
too
cold
for
of
course
if
we
adopt
the
opinion
held
by
some
that
the
temperature
on
mars
is
constantly
so
low
that
water
would
remain
perpetually
frozen
it
does
throw
the
question
of
the
kind
of
life
that
could
be
maintained
there
into
the
realm
of
pure
conjecture
the
argument
in
favor
of
an
extremely
low
temperature
on
mars
is
based
on
the
law
of
the
diminution
of
radiant
energy
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
together
with
the
assumption
that
no
qualifying
circumstances
or
no
modification
of
that
law
can
enter
into
the
problem
according
to
this
view
it
could
be
shown
that
the
temperature
on
mars
never
rises
above
but
it
is
a
view
that
seems
to
be
directly
opposed
to
the
evidence
of
the
telescope
for
all
who
have
studied
mars
under
favorable
conditions
of
observation
have
been
impressed
by
the
rapid
and
extensive
changes
that
the
appearance
of
its
surface
undergoes
coincidently
with
the
variation
of
the
seasons
it
has
its
winter
aspect
and
its
summer
aspect
perfectly
distinct
and
recognizable
in
each
hemisphere
by
turns
and
whether
the
polar
caps
be
snow
or
carbon
dioxide
at
any
rate
they
melt
and
disappear
under
a
high
sun
thus
proving
that
an
accumulation
of
heat
takes
place
professor
young
says
as
to
the
temperature
of
mars
we
have
no
certain
knowledge
on
the
one
hand
we
know
that
on
account
of
the
distance
from
the
sun
the
intensity
of
solar
radiation
upon
its
surface
must
be
less
than
here
in
the
ratio
of
to
only
about
per
cent
as
great
as
with
us
its
constant
must
be
less
than
calories
against
our
then
too
the
low
density
of
its
atmosphere
probably
less
at
the
planet
surface
than
on
the
tops
of
our
highest
mountains
would
naturally
assist
to
keep
down
the
temperature
to
a
point
far
below
the
of
water
but
on
the
other
hand
things
certainly
as
if
the
polar
caps
were
really
masses
of
and
deposited
from
vapor
in
the
atmosphere
and
as
if
these
actually
melted
during
the
martian
summer
sending
floods
of
water
through
the
channels
provided
for
them
and
causing
the
growth
of
vegetation
along
their
banks
we
are
driven
therefore
to
suppose
either
that
the
planet
has
sources
of
heat
internal
or
external
which
are
not
yet
explained
or
else
as
long
ago
suggested
that
the
polar
may
possibly
be
composed
of
something
else
than
frozen

up

the
amount

the

the

phobos
is
miles
from

of

only
from

deimos
completes
a
revolution
about
the
planet
in
thirty
hours
and
eighteen
minutes
and
phobos
in
the
astonishingly
short
period
although
of
course
it
is
in
strict
accord
with
the
law
of
gravitation
and
in
that
sense
not
astonishing
of
seven
hours
and
minutes
since
mars
takes
hours
and
minutes
for
one
rotation
on
its
axis
it
is
evident
that
phobos
goes
round
the
planet
three
times
in
the
course
of
a
single
martian
day
and
night
rising
contrary
to
the
general
motion
of
the
heavens
in
the
west
running
in
a
few
hours
through
all
the
phases
that
our
moon
exhibits
in
the
course
of
a
month
and
setting
where
the
sun
and
all
the
stars
rise
in
the
east
deimos
on
the
other
hand
has
a
period
of
revolution
five
or
six
hours
longer
than
that
of
the
planet
axial
rotation
so
that
it
rises
like
the
other
heavenly
bodies
in
the
east
but
because
its
motion
is
so
nearly
equal
in
angular
velocity
to
that
of
mars
rotation
it
shifts
very
slowly
through
the
sky
toward
the
west
and
for
two
or
three
successive
days
and
nights
it
remains
above
the
horizon
the
sun
overtaking
and
passing
it
again
and
again
while
in
the
meantime
its
protean
face
swiftly
changes
from
full
circle
to
from
to

from
crescent
back
to
half

from

to

so
on

during

is
rushing
through
the
sky
in
the
opposite
direction
as
if
in
defiance
of
the
fundamental
law
of

revolution
making
a
complete
circuit
three
times
every

and
changing
the
shape
of

disk
four
times
as
rapidly
as

does
truly
if
we
were
suddenly
transported

we
might
well
believe
that
we
had
arrived
in
the
mother
world
of
lunatics
and
that
its
two
moons
were
bewitched
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
the
peculiarities
just
mentioned
would
be
clearly
seen
from
the
surface
of
mars
by
eyes
like
ours
the
phases
of
phobos
would
probably
be
discernible
to
the
naked
eye
but
those
of
deimos
would
require
a
telescope
in
order
to
be
seen
for
notwithstanding
their
nearness
to
the
planet
mars
moons
are
inconspicuous
phenomena
even
to
the
martians
themselves
professor
young
estimate
is
that
phobos
may
shed
upon
mars
and
deimos
as
much
reflected
moonlight
as
our
moon
sends
to
the
earth
accordingly
a
moonlit
night
on
mars
can
have
no
such
charm
as
we
associate
with
the
phrase
but
it
is
surely
a
tribute
to
the
power
and
perfection
of
our
telescopes
that
we
have
been
able
to
discover
the
existence
of
objects
so
minute
and
inconspicuous
situated
at
a
distance
of
many
millions
of
miles
and
half
concealed
by
the
glaring
light
of
the
planet
close
around
which
they
revolve
if
mars
moons
were
as
massive
as
our
moon
is
they
would
raise
tremendous
tides
upon
mars
and
would
affect
the
circulation
of
water
in
the
canals
but
in
fact
their
tidal
effects
are
even
more
insignificant
than
their
powers
but
for
astronomers
on
mars
they
would
be
objects
of
absorbing
interest
upon
quitting
mars
we
pass

distinctive

the
asteroids
a
family
of
dwarf
worlds
beyond

in

terrestrial
from

jovian
planets
are
the
asteroids
of
which
nearly
five
hundred
have
been
discovered
and
designated
by
individual
names
or
numbers
but
any
statement
concerning
the
known
number
of
asteroids
can
remain
valid
for
but
a
short
time
because
new
ones
are
continually
found
especially
by
the
aid
of
photography
very
few
of
the
asteroids
are
of
measurable
size
among
these
are
the
four
that
were
the
first
to
be
discovered
ceres
pallas
juno
and
vesta
their
diameters
according
to
the
measurements
of
barnard
of
the
yerkes
observatory
are
as
follows
ceres
miles
pallas
miles
juno
miles
vesta
miles
it
is
only
necessary
to
mention
these
diameters
in
order
to
indicate
how
wide
is
the
difference
between
the
asteroids
and
such
planets
as
the
earth
venus
or
mars
the
entire
surface
of
the
largest
asteroid
ceres
does
not
equal
the
republic
of
mexico
in
area
but
ceres
itself
is
gigantic
in
comparison
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
asteroids
many
of
which
it
is
believed
do
not
exceed
twenty
miles
in
diameter
while
there
may
be
hundreds
or
thousands
of
others
still
smaller
ten
miles
five
miles
or
perhaps
only
a
few
rods
in
diameter
curiously
enough
the
asteroid
which
appears
brightest
and
which
it
would
naturally
be
inferred
is
the
largest
really
stands
third
in
the
order
of
measured
size
this
is
vesta
whose
diameter
according
to
barnard
is
only
miles
it
is
estimated
that
the
surface
of
vesta
possesses
about
four
times
greater
power
than
the
surface
of
ceres
some
observations
have
also
shown
a
variation
in
the
intensity
of
the
light
from
vesta
a
most
interesting
fact
which
becomes
still
more
significant
when
considered
in
connection
with
the
great
variability
of
another
most
extraordinary
member
of
the
asteroidal
family
eros
which
is
to
be
described
presently
the
orbits
of
the
asteroids
are
scattered
over
a
zone
about
miles
broad
the
mean
distance
from
the
sun
of
the
nearest
asteroid
eros
is
miles
and
that
of
the
most
distant
thule
miles
wide
gaps
exist
in
the
asteroidal
zone
where
few
or
no
members
of
the
group
are
to
be
found
and
daniel
kirkwood
long
ago
demonstrated
the
influence
of
jupiter
in
producing
these
gaps
almost
no
asteroids
as
he
showed
revolve
at
such
a
distance
from
the
sun
that
their
periods
of
revolution
are
exactly
commensurable
with
that
of
jupiter
originally
there
may
have
been
many
thus
situated
but
the
attraction
of
the
great
planet
has
in
the
course
of
time
swept
those
zones
clean
many
of
the
asteroids
have
very
eccentric
orbits
and
their
orbits
are
curiously
intermixed
varying
widely
among
themselves
both
in
ellipticity
and
in
inclination
to
the
common
plane
of
the
solar
system
considered
with
reference
to
the
shape
and
position
of
its
orbit
the
most
unique
of
these
little
worlds
is
eros
which
was
discovered
in
by
de
witt
at
berlin
and
which
on
account
of
its
occasional
near
approach
to
the
earth
has
lately
been
utilized
in
a
fresh
attempt
to
obtain
a
closer
approximation
to
the
true
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
earth
the
mean
distance
of
eros
from
the
sun
is
miles
its
greatest
distance
is
miles
and
its
least
distance
miles
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
although
all
the
other
asteroids
are
situated
beyond
mars
eros
at
its
mean
distance
is
nearer
to
the
sun
than
mars
is
when
in
aphelion
or
at
its
greatest
distance
eros
is
outside
of
the
orbit
of
mars
but
when
in
perihelion
it
is
so
much
inside
of
mars
orbit
that
it
comes
surprisingly
near
the
earth
indeed
there
are
times
when
eros
is
nearer
to
the
earth
than
any
other
celestial
body
ever
gets
except
the
moon
and
it
might
be
added
except
meteors
and
by
chance
a
comet
or
a
comet
tail
its
least
possible
distance
from
the
earth
is
less
than
miles
and
it
was
nearly
as
close
as
that
without
anybody
knowing
or
suspecting
the
fact
in
four
years
in
advance
of
its
discovery
yet
the
fact
strange
as
the
statement
may
seem
had
been
recorded
without
being
recognized
after
de
witt
discovery
of
eros
in
at
a
time
when
it
was
by
no
means
as
near
the
earth
as
it
had
been
some
years
before
pickering
ascertained
that
it
had
several
times
imprinted
its
image
on
the
photographic
plates
of
the
harvard
observatory
with
which
pictures
of
the
sky
are
systematically
taken
but
had
remained
unnoticed
or
had
been
taken
for
an
ordinary
star
among
the
thousands
of
star
images
surrounding
it
from
these
telltale
plates
it
was
ascertained
that
in
it
had
been
in
perihelion
very
near
the
earth
and
had
shone
with
the
brilliance
of
a
star
it
will
unfortunately
be
a
long
time
before
eros
comes
quite
as
near
us
as
it
did
on
that
occasion
when
we
failed
to
see
it
for
its
close

we
turn

extraordinary
conclusions
drawn

them

and
photographed
during
its
opposition
in
the
winter
of
several
observers
discovered
that
its
light
was
variable
to
the
extent
of
more
than
a
whole
magnitude
some
said
as
much
as
two
magnitudes
when
it
is
remembered
that
an
increase
of
one
stellar
magnitude
means
an
accession
of
light
in
the
ratio
of
to
and
an
increase
of
two
magnitudes
an
accession
of
to
the
significance
of
such
variations
as
eros
exhibited
becomes
immediately
apparent
the
shortness
of
the
period
within
which
the
cycle
of
changes
occurred
about
two
hours
and
a
half
made
the
variation
more
noticeable
and
at
the
same
time
suggested
a
ready
explanation
that
the
asteroid
was
rapidly
turning
on
its
axis
a
thing
in
itself
quite
in
accordance
with
the
behavior
of
other
celestial
bodies
and
naturally
to
be
expected
but
careful
observation
showed
that
there
were
marked
irregularities
in
the
light
fluctuations
indicating
that
eros
either
had
a
very
strange
distribution
of
light
and
dark
areas
covering
its
surface
or
that
instead
of
being
a
globular
body
it
was
of
some
extremely
irregular
shape
so
that
as
it
rotated
it
presented
successively
larger
and
smaller
reflecting
surfaces
toward
the
sun
and
the
earth
one
interesting
suggestion
was
that
the
little
planet
is
in
reality
double
the
two
components
revolving
around
their
common
center
of
gravity
like
a
close
binary
star
and
mutually
eclipsing
one
another
but
this
theory
seems
hardly
competent
to
explain
the
very
great
fluctuation
in
light
and
a
better
one
probably
is
that
suggested
by
pickering
that
eros
is
shaped
something
like
a
we
can
picture
such
a
mass
in
imagination
tumbling
end
over
end
in
its
orbit
so
as
to
present
at
one
moment
the
broad
sides
of
both
bells
together
with
their
connecting
neck
toward
the
sun
and
at
the
same
time
toward
the
observer
on
the
earth
and
at
another
moment
only
the
end
of
one
of
the
bells
the
other
bell
and
the
neck
being
concealed
in
shadow
in
this
way
the
successive
gain
and
loss
of
sixfold
in
the
amount
of
light
might
be
accounted
for
owing
to
the
great
distance
the
real
form
of
the
asteroid
is
imperceptible
even
with
powerful
telescopes
but
the
effect
of
a
change
in
the
amount
of
reflecting
surface
presented
produces
necessarily
an
alternate
waxing
and
waning
of
the
light
as
far
as
the
fluctuations
are
concerned
they
might
also
be
explained
by
supposing
that
the
shape
of
the
asteroid
is
that
of
a
flat
disk
rotating
about
one
of
its
larger
diameters
so
as
to
present
alternately
its
edge
and
its
broadside
to
the
sun
and
perhaps
in
order
completely
to
account
for
all
the
observed
eccentricities
of
the
light
of
eros
the
irregularity
of
form
may
have
to
be
supplemented
by
certain
assumptions
as
to
the
varying
reflective
capacity
of
different
parts
of
the
misshapen
mass
the
invaluable
harvard
photographs
show
that
long
before
eros
was
recognized
as
an
asteroid
its
light
variations
had
been
automatically
registered
on
the
plates
some
of
the
plates
pickering
says
had
had
an
exposure
of
an
hour
or
more
and
owing
to
its
motion
eros
had
formed
a
trail
on
each
of
these
plates
which
in
some
cases
showed
distinct
variations
in
brightness
differences
in
the
amount
of
variation
at
different
times
will
largely
depend
upon
the
position
of
the
earth
with
respect
to
the
axis
of
rotation
another
interesting
deduction
may
be
made
from
the
changes
that
the
light
of
eros
undergoes
we
have
already
remarked
that
one
of
the
larger
asteroids
and
the
one
which
appears
to
the
eye
as
the
most
brilliant
of
all
vesta
has
been
suspected
of
variability
but
not
so
extensive
as
that
of
eros
olbers
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
was
of
the
opinion
that
vesta
variations
were
due
to
its
being
not
a
globe
but
an
angular
mass
so
he
was
led
by
a
similar
phenomenon
to
precisely
the
same
opinion
about
vesta
that
has
lately
been
put
forth
concerning
eros
the
importance
of
this
coincidence
is
that
it
tends
to
revive
a
remarkable
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
asteroids
which
has
long
been
in
abeyance
and
in
the
minds
of
many
perhaps
discredited
this
theory
which
is
due
to
olbers
begins
with
the
startling
assumption
that
a
planet
perhaps
as
large
as
mars
formerly
revolving
in
an
orbit
situated
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
was
destroyed
by
an
explosion
although
at
first
glance
such
a
catastrophe
may
appear
too
wildly
improbable
for
belief
yet
it
was
not
the
improbability
of
a
world
blowing
up
that
led
to
a
temporary
abandonment
of
olbers
bold
theory
the
great
french
mathematician
lagrange
investigated
the
explosive
force
which
would
be
necessary
to
detach
a
fragment
of
matter
from
a
planet
revolving
at
a
given
distance
from
the
sun
and
published
the
results
in
the
connaissance
des
temps
for
applying
his
results
to
the
earth
lagrange
found
that
if
the
velocity
of
the
detached
fragment
exceeded
that
of
a
cannon
ball
in
the
proportion
of
to
the
fragment
would
become
a
comet
with
a
direct
motion
but
if
the
velocity
rose
in
the
proportion
of
to
the
motion
of
the
comet
would
be
retrograde
if
the
velocity
was
less
than
in
either
of
these
cases
the
fragment
would
revolve
as
a
planet
in
an
elliptic
orbit
for
any
other
planet
besides
the
earth
the
velocity
of
explosion
corresponding
to
the
different
cases
would
vary
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
square
root
of
the
mean
distance
it
would
therefore
manifestly
be
less
as
the
planet
was
more
distant
from
the
sun
in
the
case
of
each
of
the
four
smaller
planets
only
the
four
asteroids
ceres
pallas
juno
and
vesta
were
known
at
that
time
the
velocity
of
explosion
indicated
by
their
observed
motion
would
be
less
than
twenty
times
the
velocity
of
a
cannon
ball

instead
then
of
being
discredited
by
its
assumption
of
so
strange
a
catastrophe
olbers
theory
fell
into
desuetude
because
of
its
apparent
failure
to
account
for
the
position
of
the
orbits
of
many
of
the
asteroids
after
a
large
number
of
those
bodies
had
been
discovered
he
calculated
that
the
orbits
of
all
the
fragments
of
his
exploded
planet
would
have
nearly
equal
mean
distances
and
a
common
point
of
intersection
in
the
heavens
through
which
every
fragment
of
the
original
mass
would
necessarily
pass
in
each
revolution
at
first
the
orbits
of
the
asteroids
discovered
seemed
to
answer
to
these
conditions
and
olbers
was
even
able
to
use
his
theory
as
a
means
of
predicting
the
position
of
yet
undetected
asteroids
only
ceres
and
pallas
had
been
discovered
when
he
put
forth
his
theory
but
when
juno
and
vesta
were
found
they
fell
in
with
his
predictions
so
well
that
the
theory
was
generally
regarded
as
being
virtually
established
while
the
fluctuations
in
the
light
of
vesta
as
we
have
before
remarked
led
olbers
to
assert
that
that
body
was
of
a
fragmental
shape
thus
strongly
supporting
his
explosion
hypothesis
afterward
when
the
orbits
of
many
asteroids
had
been
investigated
the
soundness
of
olbers
theory
began
to
be
questioned
the
fact
that
the
orbits
did
not
all
intersect
at
a
common
point
could
easily
be
disposed
of
as
professor
newcomb
has
pointed
out
by
simply
placing
the
date
of
the
explosion
sufficiently
far
back
say
millions
of
years
ago
for
the
secular
changes
produced
by
the
attraction
of
the
larger
planets
would
effectively
mix
up
the
orbits
but
when
the
actual
effects
of
these
secular
changes
were
calculated
for
particular
asteroids
the
result
seemed
to
show
that
the
orbits
could
never
have
intersected
unless
some
of
them
have
in
the
meantime
been
altered
by
the
attraction
of
the
small
planets
on
each
other
such
an
action
is
not
impossible
but
it
is
impossible
to
determine
it
owing
to
the
great
number
of
these
bodies
and
our
ignorance
of
their
masses

yet
the
theory
has
never
been
entirely
thrown
out
and
now
that
the
discovery
of
the
light
fluctuations
of

lends
support
to
assertion
of
the
irregular
shape
of
some
of
the

it
is
very
interesting
to
recall
what
so
high
an
authority
as
professor
young
said
on
the
subject
before
the

it
is
true
as
has
often
been
urged
that
this
theory
in
its
original
form
as
presented
by
olbers
can
not
be
correct
no
explosion
of
a
planet
could
give
rise
to
the
present
assemblage
of
orbits
nor
is
it
possible
that
even
the
perturbations
of
jupiter
could
have
converted
a
set
of
orbits
originally
all
crossing
at
one
point
the
point
of
explosion
into
the
present
tangle
the
smaller
orbits
are
so
small
that
however
turned
about
they
lie
wholly
inside
the
larger
and
can
not
be
made
to
intersect
them
if
however
we
admit
a
of
explosions
this
difficulty
is
removed
and
if
we
grant
an
explosion
at
all
there
seems
to
be
nothing
improbable
in
the
hypothesis
that
the
fragments
formed
by
the
bursting
of
the
parent
mass
would
carry
away
within
themselves
the
same
forces
and
reactions
which
caused

original

so
that
they
themselves
would
be
likely
enough

attired
in

woven
largely
from

of

than
could

waif
of

one
night
as
i
was
waiting
watch
in
hand
for
an
occultation
and
striving
hard
to
keep
awake
for
it
had
been
a
hot
and
exhausting
summer
day
while
my
wife
we
were
then
in
our
honeymoon
sat
sympathetically
by
my
side
i
suddenly
found
myself
withdrawn
from
the
telescope
and
standing
in
a
place
that
appeared
entirely
strange
it
was
a
very
smooth
bit
of
ground
and
to
my
surprise
there
was
no
horizon
in
sight
that
is
to
say
the
surface
of
the
ground
disappeared
on
all
sides
at
a
short
distance
off
and
beyond
nothing
but
sky
was
visible
i
thought
i
must
be
on
the
top
of
a
stupendous
mountain
and
yet
i
was
puzzled
to
understand
how
the
face
of
the
earth
could
be
so
far
withdrawn
presently
i
became
aware
that
there
was
some
one
by
me
whom
i
could
not
see
you
are
not
on
a
mountain
my
companion
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
cold
shiver
ran
along
my
you
are
on
an
asteroid
one
of
those
miniature
planets
as
you
astronomers
call
them
and
of
which
you
have
discovered
several
hundred
revolving
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and

this
is
the
little
globe
that
you
have
glimpsed
occasionally
with
your
telescope
and
that
you
or
some
of
your
fellows
have
been
kind
enough
to
name
menippe
then
i
perceived
that
my
companion
whose
address
had
hardly
been
reassuring
was
a
gigantic
inhabitant
of
the
little
planet
towering
up
to
a
height
of
three
quarters
of
a
mile
for
a
moment
i
was
highly
amused
standing
by
his
foot
which
swelled
up
like
a
hill
and
straining
my
neck
backward
to
get
a
look
up
along
the
precipice
of
his
leg
which
curiously
enough
i
observed
was
clothed
in
rough
homespun
the
woolly
knots
of
the
cloth
appearing
of
tremendous
size
while
it
bagged
at
the
knee
like
any
terrestrial
trousers
leg
his
great
head
and
face
i
could
see
far
above
me
as
it
were
in
the
clouds
yet
i
was
not
at
all
astonished
this
is
all
right
i
said
to
myself
of
course
on
menippe
the
people
must
be
as
large
as
this
for
the
little
planet
is
only
a
dozen
miles
in
diameter
and
the
force
of
gravity
is
consequently
so
small
that
a
man
without
loss
of
activity
or
inconvenience
can
grow
three
quarters
of
a
mile
tall
suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
me
just
to
think
what
a
jump
i
can
make
why
only
the
other
day
i
was
figuring
it
out
that
a
man
could
easily
jump
a
thousand
feet
high
from
the
surface
of
menippe
and
now
here
i
actually
am
on
menippe
i
jump
the
sensation
of
that
glorious
rise
skyward
was
delightful
beyond
expression
my
legs
seemed
to
have
become
as
powerful
as
the
engines
of
a
transatlantic
liner
and
with
one
spring
i
rose
smoothly
and
swiftly
and
as
straight
as
an
arrow
surmounting
the
giant
foot
passing
his
knee
and
attaining
nearly
to
the
level
of
his
hip
then
i
felt
that
the
momentum
of
my
leap
was
exhausted
and
despite
my
efforts
i
slowly
turned
head
downward
glancing
in
affright
at
the
ground
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
me
on
which
i
expected
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
but
a
moment
thought
convinced
me
that
i
should
get
no
hurt
for
with
so
slight
a
force
of
gravity
it
would
be
more
like
floating
than
falling
just
then
the
menippean
caught
me
with
his
monstrous
hand
and
lifted
me
to
the
level
of
his
face
i
should
like
to
know
i
said
how
you
manage
to
live
up
here
you
are
so
large
and
your
planet
is
so
little
now
you
are
altogether
too
inquisitive
replied
the
giant
you
go
he
stooped
down
placed
me
on
the
toe
of
his
boot
and
drew
back
his
foot
to
kick
me
off
it
flashed
into
my
mind
that
my
situation
had
now
become
very
serious
i
knew
well
what
the
effects
of
the
small
attractive
force
of
these
diminutive
planets
must
be
for
i
had
often
amused
myself
with
calculations
about
them
in
this
moment
of
peril
i
did
not
forget
my
mathematics
it
was
clear
that
if
the
giant
propelled
me
with
sufficient
velocity
i
should
be
shot
into
space
never
to
return
how
great
would
that
velocity
have
to
be
my
mind
worked
like
lightning
on
this
problem
the
diameter
of
menippe
i
knew
did
not
exceed
twelve
miles
its
mean
density
as
near
as
i
could
judge
was
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
earth
its
attraction
must
therefore
be
as
its
radius
or
nearly
times
less
than
that
of
the
earth
a
formula
enables
us
to
compute
the
velocity
a
body
would
acquire
in
falling
from
an
infinite
distance
to
the
earth
or
any
other
planet
whose
size
and
force
of
gravity
are
known
the
same
formula
taken
in
the
opposite
sense
of
course
shows
how
fast
a
body
must
start
from
a
planet
in
order
that
it
may
be
freed
from
its
control
the
formula
is
v
square
root
of
gr
in
which
g
is
the
acceleration
of
gravity
equal
for
the
earth
to
feet
in
a
second
and
r
is
the
radius
of
the
attracting
body
on
menippe
i
knew
g
must
equal
about
one
twentieth
of
a
foot
and
r
feet
like
a
flash
i
applied
the
formula
while
the
muscles
were
yet
tightening
for
the
kick
the
square
root
of
which
is
a
fraction
more
than
feet
in
a
second
then
was
the
critical
velocity
with
which
i
must
be
kicked
off
in
order
that
i
might
never
return
i
perceived
at
once
that
the
giant
would
be
able
to
accomplish
it
i
turned
and
shouted
up
at
him
hold
on
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
dimly
saw
his
mountainous
face
puckered
into
mighty
wrinkles
out
of
which
his
eyes
glared
fiercely
and
the
next
moment
i
was
sailing
into
space
i
could
no
more
have
kept
a
balance
than
the
earth
can
stand
still
upon
its
axis
i
had
become
a
small
planet
myself
and
like
all
planets
i
rotated
yet
the
motion
did
not
dizzy
me
and
soon
i
became
intensely
interested
in
the
panorama
of
creation
that
was
spread
around
me
for
some
time
whenever
my
face
was
turned
toward
the
little
globe
of
menippe
i
saw
the
giant
partly
in
profile
against
the
sky
with
his
back
bent
and
his
hands
upon
his
knees
watching
me
with
an
occasional
approving
nod
of
his
big
head
he
looked
so
funny
standing
there
on
his
little
world
like
a
clown
on
a
performing
ball
that
despite
my
terrible
situation
i
shook
my
sides
with
laughter
there
was
no
echo
in
the
profundity
of
empty
space
soon
menippe
dwindled
to
a
point
and
i
saw
her
inhospitable
inhabitant
no
more
then
i
watched
the
sun
and
the
blazing
firmament
around
for
there
was
at
the
same
time
broad
day
and
midnight
for
me
the
sunlight
being
no
longer
diffused
by
an
atmosphere
did
not
conceal
the
face
of
the
sky
and
i
could
see
the
stars
shining
close
to
the
orb
of
day
i
recognized
the
various
planets
much
more
easily
than
i
had
been
accustomed
to
do
and
with
a
twinge
at
my
heart
saw
the
earth
traveling
along
in
its
distant
orbit
splendid
in
the
sunshine
i
thought
of
my
wife
sitting
alone
by
the
telescope
in
the
darkness
and
silence
wondering
what
had
become
of
me
i
asked
myself
how
in
the
world
can
i
ever
get
back
there
again
then
i
smiled
to
think
of
the
ridiculous
figure
i
cut
out
here
in
space
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
the
universe
a
rotating
gyrating
circumambulating
astronomer
an
animated
teetotum
lost
in
the
sky
i
saw
no
reason
to
hope
that
i
should
not
go
on
thus
forever
revolving
around
the
sun
until
my
bones
whitening
among
the
stars
might
be
revealed
to
the
superlative
powers
of
some
future
telescope
and
become
a
subject
of
absorbing
interest
the
topic
of
many
a
learned
paper
for
the
astronomers
of
a
future
age
afterward
i
was
comforted
by
the
reflection
that
in
airless
space
although
i
might
die
and
my
body
become
desiccated
yet
there
could
be
no
real
decay
even
my
garments
would
probably
last
forever
the
after
all
should
never
speculate
on
my
bones
i
saw
the
ruddy
disk
of
mars
and
the
glinting
of
his
icy
poles
as
the
beautiful
planet
rolled
far
below
me
if
i
could
only
get
there
i
thought
i
should
know
what
those
canals
of
schiaparelli
are
and
even
if
i
could
never
return
to
the
earth
i
should
doubtless
meet
with
a
warm
welcome
among
the
martians
what
a
lion
i
should
be
i
looked
longingly
at
the
distant
planet
the
outlines
of
whose
continents
and
seas
appeared
most
enticing
but
when
i
tried
to
propel
myself
in
that
direction
i
only
kicked
against
nothingness
i
groaned
in
desperation
suddenly
something
darted
by
me
flying
sunward
then
another
and
another
in
a
minute
i
was
surrounded
by
strange
projectiles
every
instant
i
expected
to
be
dashed
in
pieces
by
them
they
sped
with
the
velocity
of
lightning
hundreds
thousands
of
them
were
all
about
me
my
chance
of
not
being
hit
was
not
one
in
a
million
and
yet
i
escaped
the
sweat
of
terror
was
upon
me
but
i
did
not
lose
my
head
a
comet
has
met
me
i
said
these
missiles
are
the
meteoric
stones
of
which
it
is
composed
and
now
i
noticed
that
as
they
rushed
along
collisions
took
place
and
flashes
of
electricity
darted
from
one
to
another
a
pale
luminosity
dimmed
the
stars
i
did
not
doubt
that
as
seen
from
the
earth
the
comet
was
already
flinging
the
splendors
of
its
train
upon
the
bosom
of
the
night
while
i
was
wondering
at
my
immunity
amid
such
a
rain
of
bolts
i
became
aware
that
their
velocity
was
sensibly
diminishing
this
fact
i
explained
by
supposing
that
i
was
drawn
along
with
them
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
any
collision
with
my
body
the
overpowering
attraction
of
the
whole
mass
of
meteors
was
overcoming
my
tangential
force
and
bearing
me
in
their
direction
at
first
i
rejoiced
at
this
circumstance
for
at
any
rate
the
comet
would
save
me
from
the
dreadful
fate
of
becoming
an
asteroid
a
little
further
reflection
however
showed
me
that
i
had
gone
from
the
into
the
fire
the
direction
of
my
expulsion
from
menippe
had
been
such
that
i
had
fallen
into
an
orbit
that
would
have
carried
me
around
the
sun
without
passing
very
close
to
the
solar
body
now
being
swept
along
by
the
comet
whose
perihelion
probably
lay
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
sun
i
saw
no
way
of
escape
from
the
frightful
fate
of
being
broiled
alive
even
where
i
was
the
untempered
rays
of
the
sun
scorched
me
and
i
knew
that
within
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
miles
of
the
solar
surface
the
heat
must
be
sufficient
to
melt
the
hardest
rocks
i
was
aware
that
experiments
with
had
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
fact
but
perforce
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
at
any
rate
it
would
the
sooner
be
all
over
in
fact
i
almost
forgot
my
awful
situation
in
the
interest
awakened
by
the
phenomena
of
the
comet
i
was
in
the
midst
of
its
very
head
i
was
one
of
its
component
particles
i
was
a
meteor
among
a
million
millions
of
others
if
i
could
only
get
back
to
the
earth
what
news
could
i
not
carry
to
signor
schiaparelli
and
lockyer
and
bredichin
about
the
composition
of
comets
but
alas
the
world
could
never
know
what
i
now
saw
nobody
on
yonder
gleaming
earth
watching
the
magnificent
advance
of
this
specter
of
the
skies
would
ever
dream
that
there
was
a
lost
astronomer
in
its
blazing
head
i
should
be
burned
and
rent
to
pieces
amid
the
terrors
of
its
perihelion
passage
and
my
fragments
would
be
strewn
along
the
comet
orbit
to
become
in
course
of
time
particles
in
a
swarm
of
aerolites
perchance
through
the
effects
of
some
unforeseen
perturbation
the
earth
might
encounter
that
swarm
thus
only
could
i
ever
return
to
the
bosom
of
my
mother
planet
i
took
a
positive
pleasure
in
imagining
that
one
of
my
calcined
bones
might
eventually
flash
for
a
moment
a
falling
star
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
leaving
its
atoms
to
slowly
settle
through
the
air
until
finally
they
rested
in
the
soil
from
which
they
had
sprung
from
such
reflections
i
was
aroused
by
the
approach
of
the
crisis
the
head
of
the
comet
had
become
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
place
the
collisions
among
the
meteors
were
constantly
increasing
in
number
and
violence
how
i
escaped
destruction
i
could
not
comprehend
but
in
fact
i
was
unconscious
of
danger
from
that
source
i
had
become
in
spirit
an
actual
component
of
the
clashing
roaring
mass
tremendous
sparks
of
electricity
veritable
lightning
strokes
darted
about
me
in
every
direction
but
i
bore
a
charmed
life
as
the
comet
drew
in
nearer
to
the
sun
under
the
terrible
stress
of
the
solar
attraction
the
meteors
seemed
to
crowd
closer
crashing
and
grinding
together
while
the
whole
mass
swayed
and
shrieked
with
the
uproar
of
a
million
tormented
devils
the
heat
had
become
terrific
i
saw
stone
and
iron
melted
like
snow
and
dissipated
in
steam
stupendous
jets
of
vapor
shot
upward
and
driven
off
by
the
electrical
repulsion
of
the
sun
streamed
backward
into
the
tail
suddenly
i
myself
became
sensible
of
the
awful
heat
it
seemed
without
warning
to
have
penetrated
my
vitals
with
a
yell
i
jerked
my
feet
from
a
boiling
rock
and
flung
my
arms
despairingly
over
my
head
you
had
better
be
careful
said
my
wife
or
you
knock
over
the
telescope
i
rubbed
my
eyes
shook
myself
and
rose
i
must
have
been
dreaming
i
said
i
should
think
it
was
a
very
lively
dream
she
replied
i
responded
after
the
manner
of
a
young
man
newly
at
this
moment
the
occultation
began
chapter
vi
jupiter
the
greatest
of
known
worlds
when
we
are
thinking
of
worlds
and
trying
to
exalt
the
imagination
with
them
it
is
well
to
turn
to
jupiter
for
there
is
a
planet
worth
pondering
upon
a
world
thirteen
hundred
times
as
voluminous
as
the
earth
is
a
phenomenon
calculated
to
make
us
feel
somewhat
as
the
inhabitant
of
a
rural
village
does
when
his
amazed
vision
ranges
across
the
million
roofs
of
a
metropolis
jupiter
is
the
first
of
the
outer
and
greater
planets
the
major
or
jovian
group
his
mean
diameter
is
miles
and
his
average
girth
more
than
miles
an
inhabitant
of
jupiter
in
making
a
trip
around
his
planet
along
any
great
circle
of
the
sphere
would
have
to
travel
more
than
miles
farther
than
the
distance
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
the
polar
compression
of
jupiter
owing
to
his
rapid
rotation
amounts
in
the
aggregate
to
more
than
miles
the
equatorial
diameter
being
miles
and
the
polar
diameter
miles
jupiter
mean
distance
from
the
sun
is
miles
and
the
eccentricity
of
his
orbit
is
sufficient
to
make
this
distance
variable
to
the
extent
of
miles
but
in
view
of
his
great
average
distance
the
consequent
variation
in
the
amount
of
solar
light
and
heat
received
by
the
planet
is
not
of
serious
importance
when
he
is
in
opposition
to
the
sun
as
seen
from
the
earth
mean
distance
from
us
is
about
miles
his
year
or
period
of
revolution
about
the
sun
is
somewhat
less
than
twelve
of
our
years
years
his
axis
is
very
nearly
upright
to
the
plane
of
his
orbit
so
that
as
upon
venus
there
is
practically
no
variation
of
seasons
gigantic
though
he
is
in
dimensions
jupiter
is
the
swiftest
of
all
the
planets
in
axial
rotation
while
the
earth
requires
hours
to
make
a
complete
turn
jupiter
takes
less
than
ten
hours
nine
hours
minutes
and
a
point
on
his
equator
moves
in
consequence
of
axial
rotation
between
and
miles
in
an
hour
the
density
of
the
mighty
planet
is
slight
only
about
one
quarter
of
the
mean
density
of
the
earth
and
virtually
the
same
as
that
of
the
sun
this
fact
at
once
calls
attention
to
a
contrast
between
jupiter
and
our
globe
that
is
even
more
significant
than
their
immense
difference
in
size
the
force
of
gravity
upon
jupiter
surface
is
more
than
two
and
a
half
times
greater
than
upon
the
earth
surface
more
accurately
times
so
that
a
weight
removed
from
the
planet
on
which
we
live
to
jupiter
would
there
weigh
pounds
and
an
average
man
similarly
transported
would
be
oppressed
with
a
weight
of
at
least
pounds
but
as
a
result
of
the
rapid
rotation
of
the
great
planet
and
the
ellipticity
of
its
figure
the
unfortunate
visitor
could
find
a
perceptible
relief
from
his
troublesome
weight
by
seeking
the
equator
where
the
centrifugal
tendency
would
remove
about
twenty
pounds
from
every
one
hundred
as
compared
with
his
weight
at
the
poles
if
we
could
go
to
the
moon
or
to
mercury
venus
or
mars
we
may
be
certain
that
upon
reaching
any
of
those
globes
we
should
find
ourselves
upon
a
solid
surface
probably
composed
of
rock
not
unlike
the
rocky
crust
of
the
earth
but
with
jupiter
the
case
would
evidently
be
very
different
as
already
remarked
the
mean
density
of
that
planet
is
only
one
quarter
of
the
earth
density
or
only
one
third
greater
than
the
density
of
water
consequently
the
visitor
in
attempting
to
set
foot
upon
jupiter
might
find
no
solid
supporting
surface
but
would
be
in
a
situation
as
embarrassing
as
that
of
milton
satan
when
he
undertook
to
cross
the
domain
of
chaos
fluttering
his
pinions
vain
plumb
down
he
drops
ten
thousand
fathom
deep
and
to
this
hour
down
had
been
falling
had
not
by
ill
chance
the
strong
rebuff
of
some
tumultuous
cloud
instinct
with
fire
and
niter
hurried
him
as
many
miles
aloft
that
fury
stayed
quenched
in
a
boggy
syrtis
neither
sea
nor
good
dry
land
nigh
foundered
as
he
fares
treading
the
crude
consistence
half
on
foot
half
flying
the
probability
that
nothing
resembling
a
solid
crust
nor
perhaps
even
a
liquid
shell
would
be
found
at
the
visible
surface
of
jupiter
is
increased
by
considering
that
the
surface
density
must
be
much
less
than
the
mean
density
of
the
planet
taken
as
a
whole
and
since
the
latter
but
little
exceeds
the
density
of
water
it
is
likely
that
at
the
surface
everything
is
in
a
state
resembling
that
of
cloud
or
smoke
our
imaginary
visitor
upon
reaching
jupiter
would
under
the
influence
of
the
planet
strong
force
of
gravity
drop
out
of
sight
with
the
speed
of
a
shot
swallowed
up
in
the
vast
atmosphere
of
probably
hot
and
perhaps
partially
incandescent
gases
when
he
had
sunk
supposing
his
identity
could
be
preserved
to
a
depth
of
thousands
of
miles
he
might
not
yet
have
found
any
solid
part
of
the
planet
and
perchance
there
is
no
solid
nucleus
even
at
the
very
center
the
cloudy
aspect
of
jupiter
immediately
strikes
the
telescopic
observer
the
huge
planet
is
filled
with
color
and
with
the
animation
of
constant
movement
but
there
is
no
appearance
of
markings
like
those
on
mars
recalling
the
look
of
the
earth
there
are
no
white
polar
caps
and
no
shadings
that
suggest
the
outlines
of
continents
and
oceans
what
every
observer
even
with
the
smallest
telescope
perceives
at
once
is
a
pair
of
strongly
defined
dark
belts
one
on
either
side
of
and
both
parallel
to
the
planet
equator
these
belts
are
dark
compared
with
the
equatorial
band
between
them
and
with
the
general
surface
of
the
planet
toward
the
north
and
the
south
but
they
are
not
of
a
gray
or
neutral
shade
on
the
contrary
they
show
decided
and
at
times
brilliant
colors
usually
of
a
reddish
tone
more
delicate
tints
sometimes
a
fine
pink
salmon
or
even
light
green
are
occasionally
to
be
seen
about
the
equatorial
zone
and
the
borders
of
the
belts
while
near
the
poles
the
surface
is
shadowed
with
bluish
gray
imperceptibly
deepening
from
the
lighter
hues
of
the
equator
all
this
variety
of
tone
and
color
makes
of
a
telescopic
view
of
jupiter
a
picture
that
will
not
quickly
fade
from
the
memory
while
if
an
instrument
of
considerable
power
is
used
so
that
the
wonderful
details
of
the
belts
with
their
scalloped
edges
their
diagonal
filaments
their
many
divisions
and
their
curious
light
and
dark
spots
are
made
plain
the
observer
is
deeply
impressed
with
the
strangeness
of
the
spectacle
and
the
more
so
as
he
reflects
upon
the
enormous
real
magnitude
of
that
which
is
spread
before
his
eye
the
whole
earth
flattened
out
would
be
but
a
small
blotch
on
that
gigantic
disk
then
the
visible
rotation
of
the
great
jovian
globe
whose
effects
become
evident
to
a
practised
eye
after
but
a
few
minutes
watching
heightens
the
impression
and
the
presence
of
the
four
satellites
whose
motions
in
their
orbits
are
also
evident
through
the
change
in
their
positions
during
the
course
of
a
single
not
prolonged
observation
adds
its
influence
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
scene
indeed
color
and
motion
are
so
conspicuous
in
the
immense
spectacle
presented
by
jupiter
that
they
impart
to
it
a
powerful
suggestion
of
life
which
the
mind
does
not
readily
divest
itself
of
when
compelled
to
face
the
evidence
that
jupiter
is
as
widely
different
from
the
earth
and
as
diametrically
opposed
to
lifelike
conditions
as
we
comprehend
them
as
a
planet
possibly
could
be
the
great
belts
lie
in
latitudes
about
corresponding
to
those
in
which
the
blow
upon
the
earth
and
it
has
often
been
suggested
that
their
existence
indicates
a
similarity
between
the
atmospheric
circulation
of
jupiter
and
that
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
no
doubt
there
are
times
when
the
earth
seen
with
a
telescope
from
a
distant
planet
would
present
a
belted
appearance
somewhat
resembling
that
of
jupiter
but
there
would
almost
certainly
be
no
similar
display
of
colors
in
the
clouds
and
the
latter
would
exhibit
no
such
persistence
in
general
form
and
position
as
characterizes
those
of
jupiter
our
clouds
are
formed
by
the
action
of
the
sun
producing
evaporation
of
water
on
jupiter
whose
mean
distance
from
the
sun
is
more
than
five
times
as
great
as
ours
the
intensity
of
the
solar
rays
is
reduced
to
less
than
one
part
of
their
intensity
on
the
earth
so
that
the
evaporation
can
not
be
equally
active
there
and
the
tendency
to
form
aerial
currents
and
great
systems
of
winds
must
be
proportionally
slight
in
brief
the
clouds
of
jupiter
are
probably
of
an
entirely
different
origin
from
that
of
terrestrial
clouds
and
rather
resemble
the
chaotic
masses
of
vapor
that
enveloped
the
earth
when
it
was
still
in
a
seminebulous
condition
and
before
its
crust
had
formed
although
the
strongest
features
of
the
disk
of
jupiter
are
the
great
cloud
belts
and
the
white
or
colored
spots
in
the
equatorial
zone
yet
the
telescope
shows
many
markings
north
and
south
of
the
belts
including
a
number
of
narrower
and
fainter
belts
and
small
light
or
dark
spots
none
of
them
is
absolutely
fixed
in
position
with
reference
to
others
in
other
words
all
of
the
spots
belts
and
markings
shift
their
places
to
a
perceptible
extent
the
changes
being
generally
very
slow
and
regular
but
occasionally
quite
rapid
the
main
belts
never
entirely
disappear
and
never
depart
very
far
from
their
mean
positions
with
respect
to
the
equator
but
the
smaller
belts
toward
the
north
and
south
are
more
or
less
evanescent
round
or
oblong
spots
as
distinguished
from
belts
are
still
more
variable
and
transient
the
main
belts
themselves
show
great
internal
commotion
frequently
splitting
up
through
a
considerable
part
of
their
length
and
sometimes
apparently
throwing
out
projections
into
the
lighter
equatorial
zone
which
occasionally
resemble
bridges
diagonally
spanning
the
broad
space
between
the
belts
illustration
jupiter
as
seen
at
the
lick
observatory
in
the
great
red
spot
is
visible
together
with
the
indentation
in
the
south
belt
perhaps
the
most
puzzling
phenomenon
that
has
ever
made
its
appearance
on
jupiter
is
the
celebrated
great
red
spot
which
was
first
noticed
in
although
it
has
since
been
shown
to
be
probably
identical
with
a
similar
spot
seen
in
and
possibly
with
one
noticed
in
this
spot
soon
after
its
discovery
in
became
a
clearly
defined
red
oval
lying
near
the
southern
edge
of
the
south
belt
in
latitude
about
its
length
was
nearly
one
third
of
the
diameter
of
the
disk
and
its
width
almost
one
quarter
as
great
as
its
length
translated
into
terrestrial
measure
it
was
about
miles
long
and
miles
broad
in
it
seemed
to
deepen
in
color
until
it
became
a
truly
wonderful
object
its
redness
of
hue
irresistibly
suggesting
the
idea
that
it
was
something
hot
and
glowing
during
the
following
years
it
underwent
various
changes
of
appearance
now
fading
almost
to
invisibility
and
now
brightening
again
but
without
ever
completely
vanishing
and
it
is
still
faintly
visible
nobody
has
yet
suggested
an
altogether
probable
and
acceptable
theory
as
to
its
nature
some
have
said
that
it
might
be
a
part
of
the
crust
of
the
planet
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
clouds
others
that
its
appearance
might
be
due
to
the
clearing
off
of
the
clouds
above
a
heated
region
of
the
globe
beneath
rendering
the
latter
visible
through
the
opening
others
that
it
was
perhaps
a
mass
of
smoke
and
vapor
ejected
from
a
gigantic
volcano
or
from
the
vents
covering
a
broad
area
of
volcanic
action
others
that
it
might
be
a
vast
incandescent
slag
floating
upon
the
molten
globe
of
the
planet
and
visible
through
or
above
the
enveloping
clouds
and
others
have
thought
that
it
could
be
nothing
but
a
cloud
among
clouds
differing
for
unknown
reasons
in
composition
and
cohesion
from
its
surroundings
all
of
these
hypotheses
except
the
last
imply
the
existence
just
beneath
the
visible
cloud
shell
of
a
more
or
less
stable
and
continuous
surface
either
solid
or
liquid
when
the
red
spot
began
to
lose
distinctness
a
kind
of
veil
seemed
to
be
drawn
over
it
as
if
light
clouds
floating
at
a
superior
elevation
had
drifted
across
it
at
times
it
has
been
reduced
in
this
manner
to
a
faint
oval
ring
the
rim
remaining
visible
after
the
central
part
has
faded
from
sight
one
of
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
connected
with
the
mysterious
spot
is
a
great
bend
or
scallop
in
the
southern
edge
of
the
south
belt
adjacent
to
the
spot
this
looks
as
if
it
were
produced
by
the
spot
or
by
the
same
cause
to
which
the
spot
owes
its
existence
if
the
spot
were
an
immense
mountainous
elevation
and
the
belt
a
current
of
liquid
or
of
clouds
flowing
past
its
base
one
would
expect
to
see
some
such
bend
in
the
stream
the
visual
evidence
that
the
belt
is
driven
or
forced
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
spot
seems
complete
the
appearance
of
repulsion
between
them
is
very
striking
and
even
when
the
spot
fades
nearly
to
invisibility
the
curve
remains
equally
distinct
so
that
in
using
a
telescope
too
small
to
reveal
the
spot
itself
one
may
discover
its
location
by
observing
the
bow
in
the
south
belt
the
suggestion
of
a
resemblance
to
the
flowing
of
a
stream
past
the
foot
of
an
elevated
promontory
or
mountain
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
which
was
observed
early
in
the
history
of
the
spot
that
markings
involved
in
the
south
belt
have
a
quicker
rate
of
rotation
about
the
planet
axis
than
that
of
the
red
spot
so
that
such
markings
first
seen
in
the
rear
of
the
red
spot
gradually
overtake
and
pass
it
and
eventually
leave
it
behind
as
boats
in
a
river
drift
past
a
rock
lying
in
the
midst
of
the
current
this
leads
us
to
another
significant
fact
concerning
the
peculiar
condition
of
jupiter
surface
not
only
does
the
south
belt
move
perceptibly
faster
than
the
red
spot
but
generally
speaking
the
various
markings
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
move
at
different
rates
according
as
they
are
nearer
to
or
farther
from
the
equator
between
the
equator
and
latitude
or
there
is
a
difference
of
six
minutes
in
the
rotation
period
the
equatorial
parts
turn
round
the
axis
so
much
faster
than
the
parts
north
and
south
of
them
that
in
one
rotation
they
gain
six
minutes
of
time
in
other
words
the
clouds
over
equator
flow
past
those
in
the
middle
latitudes
with
a
relative
velocity
of
miles
per
hour
but
there
are
no
sharp
lines
of
separation
between
the
different
velocities
on
the
contrary
the
swiftness
of
rotation
gradually
diminishes
from
the
equator
toward
the
poles
as
it
manifestly
could
not
do
if
the
visible
surface
of
jupiter
were
solid
in
this
respect
jupiter
resembles
the
sun
whose
surface
also
has
different
rates
of
rotation
diminishing
from
the
equator
measured
by
the
motion
of
spots
on
or
near
the
equator
jupiter
rotation
period
is
about
nine
hours
fifty
minutes
measured
by
the
motion
of
spots
in
the
middle
latitudes
it
is
about
nine
hours
minutes
the
red
spot
completes
a
rotation
in
a
little
less
than
nine
hours
and
minutes
but
its
period
can
not
be
positively
given
for
the
singular
reason
that
it
is
variable
the
variation
amounts
to
only
a
few
seconds
in
the
course
of
several
years
but
it
is
nevertheless
certain
the
phenomenon
of
variable
motion
is
not
however
peculiar
to
the
red
spot
denning
who
has
studied
jupiter
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
says
it
is
well
known
that
in
different
latitudes
of
jupiter
there
are
currents
forming
the
belts
and
zones
moving
at
various
rates
of
speed
in
many
instances
the
velocity
changes
from
year
to
year
and
it
is
a
singular
circumstance
that
in
the
same
current
a
uniform
motion
is
not
maintained
in
all
parts
of
the
circumference
certain
spots
move
faster
than
others
so
that
if
we
would
obtain
a
fair
value
for
the
rotation
period
of
any
current
it
is
not
sufficient
to
derive
it
from
one
marking
alone
we
must
follow
a
number
of
objects
distributed
in
different
longitudes
along
the
current
and
deduce
a
mean
from
the
whole
footnote
the
observatory
no
december
nor
is
this
all
observation
indicates
that
if
we
could
look
at
a
vertical
section
of
jupiter
atmosphere
we
should
behold
an
equally
remarkable
contrast
and
conflict
of
motions
there
is
evidence
that
some
of
the
visible
spots
or
clouds
lie
at
a
greater
elevation
than
others
and
it
has
been
observed
that
the
deeper
ones
move
more
rapidly
this
fact
has
led
some
observers
to
conclude
that
the
spots
may
be
a
part
of
the
actual
surface
of
the
planet
but
if
we
could
think
that
there
is
any
solid
nucleus
or
core
in
the
body
of
jupiter
it
would
seem
on
account
of
the
slight
mean
density
of
the
planet
that
it
can
not
lie
so
near
the
visible
surface
but
must
be
at
a
depth
of
thousands
perhaps
tens
of
thousands
of
miles
since
the
telescope
is
unable
to
penetrate
the
cloudy
envelope
we
can
only
guess
at
the
actual
constitution
of
the
interior
of
jupiter
globe
in
a
spirit
of
mere
speculative
curiosity
it
has
been
suggested
that
deep
under
the
clouds
of
the
great
planet
there
may
be
a
comparatively
small
solid
globe
even
a
habitable
world
closed
round
by
a
firmament
all
its
own
whose
vault
raised
or
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
imprisoned
planet
appears
only
an
unbroken
dome
too
distant
to
reveal
its
real
nature
to
watchers
below
except
perhaps
under
telescopic
scrutiny
enclosing
as
in
a
shell
a
transparent
atmosphere
and
deriving
its
illumination
partly
from
the
sunlight
that
may
filter
through
but
mainly
from
some
luminous
source
within
but
is
not
jupiter
almost
equally
fascinating
to
the
imagination
if
we
dismiss
all
attempts
to
picture
a
humanly
impossible
world
shut
up
within
it
and
turn
rather
to
consider
what
its
future
may
be
guided
by
the
not
unreasonable
hypothesis
that
because
of
its
immense
size
and
mass
it
is
still
in
a
chaotic
condition
mention
has
been
made
of
the
resemblance
of
jupiter
to
the
sun
by
virtue
of
their
similar
manner
of
rotation
this
is
not
the
only
reason
for
looking
upon
jupiter
as
being
in
some
respects
almost
as
much
a
solar
as
a
planetary
body
its
exceptional
brightness
rather
favors
the
view
that
a
small
part
of
the
light
by
which
it
shines
comes
from
its
own
incandescence
in
size
and
mass
it
is
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
jupiter
is
eleven
times
greater
than
the
earth
in
diameter
and
thirteen
hundred
times
greater
in
volume
the
sun
is
ten
times
greater
than
jupiter
in
diameter
and
a
thousand
times
greater
in
volume
the
mean
density
of
jupiter
as
we
have
seen
is
almost
exactly
the
same
as
the
sun
now
the
history
of
the
solar
system
according
to
the
nebular
hypothesis
is
a
history
of
cooling
and
condensation
the
sun
a
thousand
times
larger
than
jupiter
has
not
yet
sufficiently
cooled
and
contracted
to
become
incrusted
except
with
a
shell
of
incandescent
metallic
clouds
jupiter
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
the
sun
has
cooled
and
contracted
until
it
is
but
slightly
if
at
all
incandescent
at
its
surface
while
its
thickening
shell
although
still
composed
of
vapor
and
smoke
and
still
probably
hot
has
grown
so
dense
that
it
entirely
cuts
off
the
luminous
radiation
from
within
the
earth
to
carry
the
comparison
one
step
further
being
more
than
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
jupiter
has
progressed
so
far
in
the
process
of
cooling
that
its
original
shell
of
vapor
has
given
place
to
one
of
solid
rock
a
sudden
outburst
of
light
from
jupiter
such
as
occurs
occasionally
in
a
star
that
is
losing
its
radiance
through
the
condensation
of
absorbing
vapors
around
it
would
furnish
strong
corroboration
of
the
theory
that
jupiter
is
really
an
extinguished
sun
which
is
now
on
the
way
to
become
a
planet
in
the
terrestrial
sense
not
very
long
ago
as
time
is
reckoned
in
astronomy
our
sun
viewed
from
the
distance
of
the
nearer
fixed
stars
may
have
appeared
as
a
binary
star
the
brighter
component
of
the
pair
being
the
sun
itself
and
the
fainter
one
the
body
now
called
the
planet
jupiter
supposing
the
latter
to
have
had
the
same
intrinsic
brilliance
surface
for
surface
as
the
sun
it
would
have
radiated
one
hundred
times
less
light
than
the
sun
a
difference
of
one
hundredfold
between
the
light
of
two
stars
means
that
they
are
six
magnitudes
apart
or
in
other
words
from
a
point
in
space
where
the
sun
appeared
as
bright
as
what
we
call
a
star
its
companion
jupiter
would
have
shone
as
a
star
many
stars
have
companions
proportionally
much
fainter
than
that
the
companion
of
sirius
for
instance
is
at
least
ten
thousand
times
less
bright
than
its
great
comrade
looking
at
jupiter
in
this
way
it
interests
us
not
as
the
probable
abode
of
intelligent
life
but
as
a
world
in
the
making
a
world
moreover
which
when
it
is
completed
if
it
ever
shall
be
after
the
terrestrial
pattern
will
dwarf
our
globe
into
insignificance
that
stupendous
miracle
of
which
is
dimly
painted
in
the
grand
figures
employed
by
the
writers
of
genesis
and
the
composers
of
other
cosmogonic
legends
is
here
actually
going
on
before
our
eyes
the
telescope
shows
us
in
the
cloudy
face
of
jupiter
the
moving
of
the
spirit
upon
the
face
of
the
great
deep
what
the
final
result
will
be
we
can
not
tell
but
clearly
the
end
of
the
grand
processes
there
in
operation
has
not
yet
been
reached
the
interesting
suggestion
was
made
and
urged
by
proctor
that
if
jupiter
itself
is
in
no
condition
at
present
to
bear
life
its
satellites
may
be
in
that
respect
more
happily
circumstanced
it
can
not
be
said
that
very
much
has
been
learned
about
the
satellites
of
jupiter
since
proctor
day
and
his
suggestion
is
no
less
and
no
more
probable
now
than
it
was
when
first
offered
there
has
been
cumulative
evidence
that
jupiter
satellites
obey
the
same
law
that
governs
the
rotation
of
our
moon
that
which
compels
them
always
to
keep
the
same
face
turned
toward
their
primary
and
this
would
clearly
affect
although
it
might
not
preclude
their
habitability
with
the
exception
of
the
minute
fifth
satellite
discovered
by
barnard
in
they
are
all
of
sufficient
size
to
retain
at
least
some
traces
of
an
atmosphere
in
fact
one
of
them
is
larger
than
the
planet
mars
and
another
is
of
nearly
the
same
size
as
that
planet
while
the
smallest
of
the
four
principal
ones
is
about
equal
to
our
moon
under
the
powerful
attraction
of
jupiter
they
travel
rapidly
and
viewed
from
the
surface
of
that
planet
they
would
offer
a
wonderful
spectacle
they
are
continually
causing
solar
eclipses
and
themselves
undergoing
eclipse
in
jupiter
shadow
and
their
swiftly
changing
aspects
and
groupings
would
be
watched
by
an
astronomer
on
jupiter
with
undying
interest
but
far
more
wonderful
would
be
the
spectacle
presented
by
jupiter
to
inhabitants
dwelling
on
his
moons
from
the
nearer
moon
in
particular
which
is
situated
less
than
miles
from
jupiter
surface
the
great
planet
would
be
an
overwhelming
phenomenon
in
the
sky
its
immense
disk
hanging
overhead
would
cover
a
circle
of
the
firmament
twenty
degrees
in
diameter
or
in
round
numbers
forty
times
the
diameter
of
the
full
moon
as
seen
from
the
earth
it
would
shed
a
great
amount
of
light
and
heat
and
thus
would
more
or
less
effectively
supply
the
deficit
of
solar
radiation
for
we
must
remember
that
jupiter
and
his
satellites
receive
from
the
sun
less
than
one
as
much
light
and
heat
as
the
earth
receives
the
maze
of
contending
motions
the
rapid
flow
and
eddying
of
cloud
belts
the
outburst
of
strange
fiery
spots
the
display
of
rich
varied
and
constantly
changing
colors
which
astonish
and
delight
the
telescopic
observer
on
the
earth
would
be
exhibited
to
the
naked
eye
of
an
inhabitant
of
jupiter
nearest
moon
far
more
clearly
than
the
greatest
telescope
is
able
to
reveal
them
to
us
here
again
the
mind
is
carried
back
to
long
past
ages
in
the
history
of
the
planet
on
which
we
dwell
it
is
believed
by
some
that
our
moon
may
have
contained
inhabitants
when
the
earth
was
still
hot
and
glowing
as
jupiter
appears
to
be
now
and
that
as
the
earth
cooled
and
became
habitable
the
moon
gradually
parted
with
its
atmosphere
and
water
so
that
its
living
races
perished
almost
coincidently
with
the
beginning
of
life
on
the
earth
if
we
accept
this
view
and
apply
it
to
the
case
of
jupiter
we
may
conclude
that
when
that
enormous
globe
has
cooled
and
settled
down
to
a
possibly
habitable
condition
its
four
attendant
moons
will
suffer
the
fate
that
overtook
the
earth
satellite
and
in
their
turn
become
barren
and
while
the
great
orb
that
once
nurtured
them
with
its
light
and
heat
receives
the
promethean
fire
and
begins
to
bloom
with
life
chapter
vii
saturn
a
prodigy
among
planets
one
of
the
first
things
that
persons
unaccustomed
to
astronomical
observations
ask
to
see
when
they
have
an
opportunity
to
look
through
a
telescope
is
the
planet
saturn
many
telescopic
views
in
the
heavens
disappoint
the
beginner
but
that
of
saturn
does
not
even
though
the
planet
may
not
look
as
large
as
he
expects
to
see
it
from
what
he
has
been
told
of
the
magnifying
power
employed
the
untrained
observer
is
sure
to
be
greatly
impressed
by
the
wonderful
rings
suspended
around
it
as
if
by
a
miracle
no
previous
inspection
of
pictures
of
these
rings
can
rob
them
of
their
effect
upon
the
eye
and
the
mind
they
are
overwhelming
in
their
inimitable
singularity
and
they
leave
every
spectator
truly
amazed
sir
john
herschel
has
remarked
that
they
have
the
appearance
of
an
elaborately
artificial
mechanism
they
have
even
been
regarded
as
habitable
bodies
what
we
are
to
think
of
that
proposition
we
shall
see
when
we
come
to
consider
their
composition
and
probable
origin
in
the
meantime
let
us
recall
the
main
facts
of
saturn
dimensions
and
situation
in
the
solar
system
saturn
is
the
second
of
the
major
or
jovian
group
of
planets
and
is
situated
at
a
mean
distance
from
the
sun
of
miles
we
need
not
consider
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
which
although
relatively
not
very
great
produces
a
variation
of
miles
in
its
distance
from
the
sun
because
at
its
immense
mean
distance
this
change
would
not
be
of
much
importance
with
regard
to
the
planet
habitability
or
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
saturn
can
never
be
nearer
than
miles
to
the
earth
or
eight
times
the
distance
from
us
it
receives
from
the
sun
about
one
ninetieth
of
the
light
and
heat
that
we
get
illustration
saturn
in
its
three
principal
phases
as
seen
from
the
earth
from
a
drawing
by
bond
saturn
takes
and
a
half
years
to
complete
a
journey
about
the
sun
like
jupiter
it
rotates
very
rapidly
on
its
axis
the
period
being
ten
hours
and
fourteen
minutes
its
axis
of
rotation
is
inclined
not
far
from
the
same
angle
as
that
of
the
earth
axis
so
that
its
seasons
should
resemble
ours
although
their
alternations
are
extremely
slow
in
consequence
of
the
enormous
length
of
saturn
year
not
including
the
rings
in
the
calculation
saturn
exceeds
the
earth
in
size
times
the
addition
of
the
rings
would
not
however
greatly
alter
the
result
of
the
comparison
because
although
the
total
surface
of
the
rings
counting
both
faces
exceeds
the
earth
surface
about
times
their
volume
owing
to
their
surprising
thinness
is
only
about
six
times
the
volume
of
the
earth
and
their
mass
in
consequence
of
their
slight
density
is
very
much
less
than
the
earth
perhaps
indeed
inappreciable
in
comparison
saturn
mean
diameter
is
miles
and
its
polar
compression
is
even
greater
than
that
of
jupiter
a
difference
of
miles
almost
comparable
with
the
entire
diameter
of
the
earth
existing
between
its
equatorial
and
its
polar
diameter
the
former
being
and
the
latter
miles
we
found
the
density
of
jupiter
astonishingly
slight
but
that
of
saturn
is
slighter
still
jupiter
would
sink
if
thrown
into
water
but
saturn
would
actually
float
if
not
like
a
cork
yet
quite
as
buoyantly
as
many
kinds
of
wood
for
its
mean
density
is
only
three
quarters
that
of
water
or
one
eighth
of
the
earth
in
fact
there
is
no
known
planet
whose
density
is
so
slight
as
saturn
thus
it
happens
that
notwithstanding
its
vast
size
and
mass
the
force
of
gravity
upon
saturn
is
nearly
the
same
as
upon
our
globe
upon
visiting
venus
we
should
find
ourselves
weighing
a
little
less
than
at
home
and
upon
visiting
saturn
a
little
more
but
in
neither
case
would
the
difference
be
very
important
if
the
relative
weight
of
bodies
on
the
surfaces
of
planets
formed
the
sole
test
of
their
habitability
venus
and
saturn
would
both
rank
with
the
earth
as
suitable
abodes
for
men
but
the
exceedingly
slight
density
of
saturn
seems
to
be
most
reasonably
accounted
for
on
the
supposition
that
like
jupiter
it
is
in
a
vaporous
condition
still
very
hot
within
although
but
slightly
if
at
all
incandescent
at
the
surface
and
therefore
unsuited
to
contain
life
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
speculate
about
any
solid
nucleus
within
because
even
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
or
probable
it
must
lie
forever
hidden
from
our
eyes
but
if
we
accept
the
theory
that
saturn
is
in
an
early
formative
stage
and
that
millions
of
years
hence
it
may
become
an
incrusted
and
habitable
globe
we
shall
at
least
follow
the
analogy
of
what
we
believe
to
have
been
the
history
of
the
earth
except
that
saturn
immense
distance
from
the
sun
will
always
prevent
it
from
receiving
an
amount
of
solar
radiation
consistent
with
our
ideas
of
what
is
required
by
a
living
world
of
course
since
one
can
imagine
what
he
chooses
it
is
possible
to
suppose
inhabitants
suited
to
existence
in
a
world
composed
only
of
whirling
clouds
and
a
poet
with
the
imagination
of
a
milton
might
give
us
very
imposing
and
stirring
images
of
such
creatures
and
their
chaotic
surroundings
but
fancies
like
these
can
have
no
basis
in
human
experience
and
consequently
can
make
no
claim
upon
scientific
recognition
or
as
an
alternative
it
might
be
assumed
that
saturn
is
composed
of
lighter
elements
and
materials
than
those
which
constitute
the
earth
and
the
other
solid
planets
in
the
more
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
sun
but
such
an
assumption
would
put
us
entirely
at
sea
as
regards
the
forms
of
organic
life
that
could
exist
upon
a
planet
of
that
description
and
like
sir
humphry
davy
in
the
vision
that
occupies
the
first
chapter
of
his
quaintly
charming
consolations
in
travel
or
the
last
days
of
a
philosopher
we
should
be
thrown
entirely
upon
the
resources
of
the
imagination
in
representing
to
ourselves
the
nature
and
appearance
of
its
inhabitants
yet
minds
of
unquestioned
power
and
sincerity
have
in
all
ages
found
pleasure
and
even
profit
in
such
exercises
and
with
every
fresh
discovery
arises
a
new
flight
of
fancies
like
butterflies
from
a
roadside
pool
as
affording
a
glimpse
into
the
mind
of
a
remarkable
man
as
well
as
a
proof
of
the
fascination
of
such
subjects
it
will
be
interesting
to
quote
from
the
book
just
mentioned
description
of
his
imaginary
inhabitants
of
saturn
i
saw
below
me
a
surface
infinitely
diversified
something
like
that
of
an
immense
glacier
covered
with
large
columnar
masses
which
appeared
as
if
formed
of
glass
and
from
which
were
suspended
rounded
forms
of
various
sizes
which
if
they
had
not
been
transparent
i
might
have
supposed
to
be
fruit
from
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
analogous
to
ice
streams
of
the
richest
tint
of
rose
color
or
purple
burst
forth
and
flowed
into
basins
forming
lakes
or
seas
of
the
same
color
looking
through
the
atmosphere
toward
the
heavens
i
saw
brilliant
opaque
clouds
of
an
azure
color
that
reflected
the
light
of
the
sun
which
had
to
my
eyes
an
entirely
new
aspect
and
appeared
smaller
as
if
seen
through
a
dense
blue
mist
i
saw
moving
on
the
surface
below
me
immense
masses
the
forms
of
which
i
find
it
impossible
to
describe
they
had
systems
for
locomotion
similar
to
those
of
the
morse
or
but
i
saw
with
great
surprise
that
they
moved
from
place
to
place
by
six
extremely
thin
membranes
which
they
used
as
wings
their
colors
were
varied
and
beautiful
but
principally
azure
and
rose
color
i
saw
numerous
convolutions
of
tubes
more
analogous
to
the
trunk
of
the
elephant
than
to
anything
else
i
can
imagine
occupying
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
upper
parts
of
the
body
it
was
with
a
species
of
terror
that
i
saw
one
of
them
mounting
upward
apparently
flying
toward
those
opaque
clouds
which
i
have
before
mentioned
know
what
your
feelings
are
said
the
genius

analogies
and
all
the
elements
of
knowledge
to
comprehend
the
scene
before
you
you
are
in
the
same
state
in
which
a
fly
would
be
whose
microscopic
eye
was
changed
for
one
similar
to
that
of
man
and
you
are
wholly
unable
to
associate
what
you
now
see
with
your
former
knowledge
but
those
beings
who
are
before
you
and
who
appear
to
you
almost
as
imperfect
in
their
functions
as
the
zoophytes
of
the
polar
sea
to
which
they
are
not
unlike
in
their
apparent
organization
to
your
eyes
have
a
sphere
of
sensibility
and
intellectual
enjoyment
far
superior
to
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
your
earth
each
of
those
tubes
which
appears
like
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
is
an
organ
of
peculiar
motion
or
sensation
they
have
many
modes
of
perception
of
which
you
are
wholly
ignorant
at
the
same
time
that
their
sphere
of
vision
is
infinitely
more
extended
than
yours
and
their
organs
of
touch
far
more
perfect
and
exquisite
after
descanting
upon
the
advantages
of
saturn

for
surveying
some
of
the
phenomena
of
the
solar
system
and
of
outer
space

the
consequent
immense
advances

the
marvelous
results
of
the
powers
possessed
by
these
highly
intellectual
beings
and
of
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
they
have
applied
and
modified
matter
those
columnar
masses
which
seem
to
you
as
if
rising
out
of
a
mass
of
ice
below
are
results
of
art

processes
are
going
on

be
performed
in
your
laboratories
or
more
properly
in
your
refined
culinary
apparatus

they
are
connected
with
their
system
of
nourishment
those
opaque
azure
clouds
to
which
you
saw
a
few
minutes
ago
one
of
those
beings
directing
his
course
are
works
of
art

places
in
which
they

the
quantity
of
light
most
fitted
for
their
philosophical
researches

most
convenient
for
the
purposes
of
life
footnote
davy
of
course
was
aware
that
owing
to
increase
of
distance
the
sun
would
appear
to
an
inhabitant
of
saturn
with
a
disk
only
one
ninetieth
as
great
in
area
as
that
which
it
presents
to
our
eyes
but
while
saturn
does
not
appear
with
our
present
knowledge
to
hold
out
any
encouragement
to
those
who
would
regard
it
as
the
abode
of
living
creatures
capable
of
being
described
in
any
terms
except
those
of
pure
imagination
yet
it
is
so
unique
a
curiosity
among
the
heavenly
bodies
that
one
returns
again
and
again
to
the
contemplation
of
its
strange
details
saturn
has
nine
moons
but
some
of
them
are
relatively
small
bodies
the
ninth
discovered
photographically
by
professor
pickering
in
being
especially
minute
and
others
are
situated
at
great
distances
from
the
planet
and
for
these
reasons
together
with
the
fact
that
the
sunlight
is
so
feeble
upon
them
that
surface
for
surface
they
have
only
one
ninetieth
as
much
illumination
as
our
moon
receives
they
can
not
make
a
very
brilliant
display
in
the
saturnian
sky
to
astronomers
on
saturn
they
would
of
course
be
intensely
interesting
because
of
their
perturbations
and
particularly
the
effect
of
their
attraction
on
the
rings
this
brings
us
again
to
the
consideration
of
those
marvelous
appendages
and
to
the
statement
of
facts
about
them
which
we
have
not
yet
recalled
if
the
reader
will
take
a
ball
three
inches
in
diameter
to
represent
the
globe
of
saturn
and
out
of
the
center
of
a
circular
piece
of
seven
inches
in
diameter
will
cut
a
round
hole
three
and
three
quarter
inches
across
and
will
then
place
the
ball
in
the
middle
of
the
hole
in
the
paper
he
will
have
a
very
fair
representation
of
the
relative
proportions
of
saturn
and
its
rings
to
represent
the
main
gap
or
division
in
the
rings
he
might
draw
a
little
more
than
three
eighths
of
an
inch
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
paper
disk
a
pencil
line
about
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
broad
perhaps
the
most
striking
fact
that
becomes
conspicuous
in
making
such
a
model
of
the
saturnian
system
is
the
exceeding
thinness
of
the
rings
as
compared
with
their
enormous
extent
they
are
about
miles
across
from
outer
edge
to
outer
edge
and
about
miles
broad
from
outer
edge
to
inner
edge
including
the
gauze
ring
presently
to
be
mentioned
yet
their
thickness
probably
does
not
surpass
one
hundred
miles
in
fact
the
sheet
of
paper
in
our
imaginary
model
is
several
times
too
thick
to
represent
the
true
relative
thickness
of
rings
several
narrow
gaps
in
the
rings
have
been
detected
from
time
to
time
but
there
is
only
one
such
gap
that
is
always
clearly
to
be
seen
the
one
already
mentioned
situated
about
miles
from
the
outer
edge
and
about
miles
in
width
inside
of
this
gap
the
broadest
and
brightest
ring
appears
having
a
width
of
about
miles
for
some
reason
this
great
ring
is
most
brilliant
near
the
gap
and
its
brightness
gradually
falls
off
toward
its
inner
side
at
a
distance
of
something
less
than
miles
from
the
planet
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
above
the
planet
for
the
rings
hang
directly
over
saturn
equator
the
broad
bright
ring
merges
into
a
mysterious
gauzelike
object
also
in
the
form
of
a
ring
which
extends
to
within
or
miles
of
the
planet
surface
and
therefore
itself
has
a
width
of
say
miles
in
consequence
of
the
thinness
of
the
rings
they
completely
disappear
from
the
range
of
vision
of
small
telescopes
when
as
occurs
once
in
every
fifteen
years
they
are
seen
exactly
edgewise
from
the
earth
in
a
telescope
powerful
enough
to
reveal
them
when
in
that
situation
they
resemble
a
thin
glowing
needle
run
through
the
ball
of
the
planet
the
rings
will
be
in
this
position
in
and
again
in
the
opacity
of
the
rings
is
proved
by
the
shadow
which
they
cast
upon
the
ball
of
the
planet
this
is
particularly
manifest
at
the
time
when
they
are
edgewise
to
the
earth
for
the
sun
being
situated
slightly
above
or
below
the
plane
of
the
rings
then
throws
their
shadow
across
saturn
close
to
its
equator
when
they
are
canted
at
a
considerable
angle
to
our
line
of
sight
their
shadow
is
seen
on
the
planet
bordering
their
outer
edge
where
they
cross
the
ball
the
gauze
ring
the
detection
of
which
as
a
faintly
luminous
phenomenon
requires
a
powerful
telescope
can
be
seen
with
slighter
telescopic
power
in
the
form
of
a
light
shade
projected
against
the
planet
at
the
inner
edge
of
the
broad
bright
ring
the
explanation
of
the
existence
of
this
peculiar
object
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
entire
system
which
instead
of
being
as
the
earliest
observers
thought
it
a
solid
ring
or
series
of
concentric
rings
is
composed
of
innumerable
small
bodies
like
meteorites
perhaps
in
size
circulating
independently
but
in
comparatively
close
juxtaposition
to
one
another
about
saturn
and
presenting
to
our
eyes
because
of
their
great
number
and
of
our
enormous
distance
the
appearance
of
solid
uniform
rings
so
a
flock
of
ducks
may
look
from
afar
like
a
continuous
black
line
or
band
although
if
we
were
near
them
we
should
perceive
that
a
considerable
space
separates
each
individual
from
his
neighbors
the
fact
that
this
is
the
constitution
of
saturn
rings
can
be
confidently
stated
because
it
has
been
mathematically
proved
that
they
could
not
exist
if
they
were
either
solid
or
liquid
bodies
in
a
continuous
form
and
because
the
late
james
keeler
demonstrated
with
the
spectroscope
by
means
of
the
doppler
principle
already
explained
in
the
chapter
on
venus
that
the
rings
circulate
about
the
planet
with
varying
velocities
according
to
their
distance
from
center
exactly
as
independent
satellites
would
do
it
might
be
said
then
that
saturn
instead
of
having
nine
satellites
only
has
untold
millions
of
them
traveling
in
orbits
so
closely
contiguous
that
they
form
the
appearance
of
a
vast
ring
as
to
their
origin
it
may
be
supposed
that
they
are
a
relic
of
a
ring
of
matter
left
in
suspension
during
the
contraction
of
the
globe
of
saturn
from
a
nebulous
mass
just
as
the
rings
from
which
the
various
planets
are
supposed
to
have
been
formed
were
left
off
during
the
contraction
of
the
main
body
of
the
original
solar
nebula
other
similar
rings
originally
surrounding
saturn
may
have
become
satellites
but
the
matter
composing
the
existing
rings
is
so
close
to
the
planet
that
it
falls
within
the
critical
distance
known
as
roche
limit
within
which
owing
to
the
tidal
effect
of
the
planet
attraction
no
body
so
large
as
a
true
satellite
could
exist
and
accordingly
in
the
process
of
formation
of
the
saturnian
system
this
matter
instead
of
being
aggregated
into
a
single
satellite
has
remained
spread
out
in
the
form
of
a
ring
although
its
substance
long
ago
passed
from
the
vaporous
and
liquid
to
the
solid
form
we
have
spoken
of
the
rings
as
being
composed
of
meteorites
but
perhaps
their
component
particles
may
be
so
small
as
to
answer
more
closely
to
the
definition
of
dust
in
these
rings
of
dust
or
meteorites
disturbances
are
produced
by
the
attraction
of
the
planet
and
that
of
the
outer
satellites
and
it
is
yet
a
question
whether
they
are
a
stable
and
permanent
feature
of
saturn
or
will
in
the
course
of
time
be
destroyed

it
has
been
thought
that
the
gauze
ring
is
variable
in
brightness
this
would
tend
to
show
that
it
is
composed
of
bodies
which
have
been
drawn
in
toward
the
planet
from
the
principal
mass
of
the
rings
and
these
bodies
may
end
their
career
by
falling
upon
the
planet
this
process
indefinitely
continued
would
result
in
the
total
disappearance
of
the
rings
saturn
would
finally
swallow
them
as
the
old
god
from
whom
the
planet
gets

name
is
fabled
to
have
swallowed
his
children
near
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
saturn
rings
have
been
regarded
as
habitable
bodies
that
of
course
was
before
the
discovery
that
they
were
not
solid
knowing
what
we
now
know
about
them
even
thomas
dick
the
great
scotch
popularizer
of
astronomy
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
would
have
been
compelled
to
abandon
his
theory
that
saturn
rings
were
crowded
with
inhabitants
at
the
rate
of
to
the
square
mile
he
reckoned
that
they
could
easily
contain
people
he
even
seems
to
have
regarded
their
edges
in
his
time
their
actual
thinness
was
already
well
known
as
useful
ground
for
the
support
of
living
creatures
for
he
carefully
calculated
the
aggregate
area
of
these
edges
and
found
that
it
considerably
exceeded
the
area
of
the
entire
surface
of
the
earth
indeed
dick
found
room
for
more
inhabitants
on
saturn
rings
than
on
saturn
itself
for
excluding
the
gauze
ring
undiscovered
in
his
day
the
two
surfaces
of
the
rings
are
greater
in
area
than
the
surface
of
the
globe
of
the
planet
he
did
not
attack
the
problem
of
the
weight
of
bodies
on
worlds
in
the
form
of
broad
flat
thin
surfaces
like
saturn
rings
or
indulge
in
any
reflections
on
the
interrelations
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
opposite
sides
although
he
described
the
wonderful
appearance
of
saturn
and
other
celestial
objects
as
viewed
from
the
rings
but
all
these
speculations
fall
to
the
ground
in
face
of
the
simple
fact
that
if
we
could
reach
saturn
rings
we
should
find
nothing
to
stand
upon
except
a
cloud
of
swiftly
flying
dust
or
a
swarm
of
meteors
swayed
by
contending
attractions
and
indeed
it
is
likely
that
upon
arriving
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
rings
they
would
virtually
disappear
seen
close
at
hand
their
component
particles
might
be
so
widely
separated
that
all
appearance
of
connection
between
them
would
vanish
and
it
has
been
estimated
that
from
saturn
surface
the
rings
instead
of
presenting
a
gorgeous
arch
spanning
the
heavens
may
be
visible
only
as
a
faintly
gleaming
band
like
the
milky
way
or
the
zodiacal
light
in
this
respect
the
mystic
swedenborg
appears
to
have
had
a
clearer
conception
of
the
true
nature
of
saturn
rings
than
did
dick
for
in
his
book
on
the
earths
in
the
universe
he
says
using
the
word
belt
to
describe
the
phenomenon
of
the
rings
being
questioned
concerning
that
great
belt
which
appears
from
our
earth
to
rise
above
the
horizon
of
that
planet
and
to
vary
its
situations
they
the
inhabitants
of
saturn
said
that
it
does
not
appear
to
them
as
a
belt
but
only
as
somewhat
whitish
like
snow
in
the
heaven
in
various
directions
in
view
of
such
observations
as
that
of
barnard
in
showing
that
a
satellite
passing
through
the
shadow
of
saturn
rings
does
not
entirely
disappear
a
fact
which
proves
that
the
rings
are
partially
transparent
to
the
sunlight
one
might
be
tempted
to
ask
whether
saturn
itself
considering
its
astonishing
lack
of
density
is
not
composed
at
least
in
its
outer
parts
of
separate
particles
of
matter
revolving
independently
about
their
center
of
attraction
and
presenting
the
appearance
of
a
smooth
uniform
shell
reflecting
the
light
of
the
sun
in
other
words
may
not
saturn
be
exteriorly
a
globe
of
dust
instead
of
a
globe
of
vapor
certainly
the
rings
incoherent
and
translucent
though
they
be
reflect
the
sunlight
to
our
eyes
at
least
from
the
brighter
part
of
their
surface
with
a
brilliance
comparable
with
that
of
the
globe
of
the
planet
itself
as
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
interior
condition
of
saturn
and
jupiter
it
should
perhaps
be
said
that
mathematical
considerations
based
on
the
figures
of
equilibrium
of
rotating
liquid
masses
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
those
planets
are
comparatively
very
dense
within
professor
darwin
puts
the
statement
very
strongly
as
follows
in
this
way
it
is
known
with
certainty
that
the
central
portions
of
the
planets
jupiter
and
saturn
are
much
denser
compared
to
their
superficial
portions
than
is
the
case
with
the
earth

the

the
full

then
when

there
ensues
a

of
fifteen

duration
also
whatever
appearance
the

may
present
from

at

in

what
has
been
said
of
jupiter
and
saturn
applies
also
to
the
remaining
members
of
the
jovian
group
of
planets
uranus
and
neptune
that
their
density
is
so
small
that
it
seems
probable
that
they
can
not
at
the
present
time
be
in
a
habitable
planetary
condition
all
four
of
these
outer
larger
planets
have
in
comparatively
recent
times
been
solar
orbs
small
companions
of
the
sun
the
density
of
uranus
is
about
one
fifth
greater
than
that
of
water
and
slightly
greater
than
that
of
neptune
uranus
is
miles
in
diameter
and
neptune
miles
curiously
enough
the
force
of
gravity
upon
each
of
these
two
large
planets
is
a
little
less
than
upon
the
earth
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
in
reckoning
gravity
on
the
surface
of
a
planet
not
only
the
mass
of
the
planet
but
its
diameter
or
radius
must
be
considered
gravity
varies
directly
as
the
mass
but
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
radius
and
for
this
reason
a
large
planet
of
small
density
may
exercise
a
less
force
of
gravity
at
its
surface
than
does
a
small
planet
of
great
density
the
mean
distance
of
uranus
from
the
sun
is
about
miles
and
its
period
of
revolution
is
years
neptune
mean
distance
is
about
miles
and
its
period
of
revolution
is
about
years
uranus
has
four
satellites
and
neptune
one
the
remarkable
thing
about
these
satellites
is
that
they
revolve
or
contrary
to
the
direction
in
which
all
the
other
satellites
belonging
to
the
solar
system
revolve
and
in
which
all
the
other
planets
rotate
on
their
axis
in
the
case
of
uranus
the
plane
in
which
the
satellites
revolve
is
not
far
from
a
position
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
but
in
the
case
of
neptune
the
plane
of
revolution
of
the
satellites
is
tipped
much
farther
backward
since
in
every
other
case
the
satellites
of
a
planet
are
situated
nearly
in
the
plane
of
the
planet
equator
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
same
rule
holds
with
uranus
and
neptune
and
that
being
so
we
must
conclude
that
those
planets
rotate
backward
on
their
axes
this
has
an
important
bearing
on
the
nebular
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
the
solar
system
and
at
one
time
was
thought
to
furnish
a
convincing
argument
against
that
hypothesis
but
it
has
been
shown
that
by
a
modification
of
laplace
theory
the
peculiar
behavior
of
uranus
and
neptune
can
be
reconciled
with
it
very
little
is
known
of
the
surfaces
of
uranus
and
neptune
indications
of
the
existence
of
belts
resembling
those
of
jupiter
have
been
found
in
the
case
of
both
planets
there
are
similar
belts
on
saturn
and
as
they
seem
to
be
characteristic
of
large
rapidly
rotating
bodies
of
small
density
it
was
to
be
expected
that
they
would
be
found
on
uranus
and
neptune
the
very
interesting
opinion
is
entertained
by
some
astronomers
that
there
is
at
least
one
other
great
planet
beyond
neptune
the
orbits
of
certain
comets
are
relied
upon
as
furnishing
evidence
of
the
existence
of
such
a
body
george
forbes
has
estimated
that
this
as
yet
undiscovered
planet
may
be
even
greater
than
jupiter
in
mass
and
may
be
situated
at
a
distance
from
the
sun
one
hundred
times
as
great
as
the
earth
where
it
revolves
in
an
orbit
a
single
circuit
of
which
requires
a
thousand
years
whether
this
planet
with
a
year
a
thousand
of
our
years
in
length
will
ever
be
seen
with
a
telescope
or
whether
its
existence
will
ever
in
some
other
manner
be
fully
demonstrated
can
not
yet
be
told
it
will
be
remembered
that
neptune
was
discovered
by
means
of
computations
based
upon
its
disturbing
attraction
on
uranus
before
it
had
ever
been
recognized
with
the
telescope
but
when
the
astronomers
in
the
observatories
were
told
by
their
mathematical
brethren
where
to
look
they
found
the
planet
within
half
an
hour
after
the
search
began
so
it
is
possible
the
suspected
great
planet
beyond
neptune
may
be
within
the
range
of
telescopic
vision
but
may
not
be
detected
until
elaborate
calculations
have
deduced
its
place
in
the
heavens
as
a
populous
city

said
to
furnish
the
best
for

escape

in

the
naked
eye
perceives
the
larger
configurations
of
the
lunar
surface
more
clearly
than
the
most
powerful
telescope
shows
the
details
on
the
disk
of
mars
long
before
the
time
of
galileo
and
the
invention
of
the
telescope
men
had
noticed
that
the
face
of
the
moon
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
appearance
that
the
earth
would
present
if
viewed
from
afar
off
in
remote
antiquity
there
were
philosophers
who
thought
that
the
moon
was
an
inhabited
world
and
very
early
the
romancers
took
up
the
theme
lucian
the
voltaire
of
the
second
century
of
our
era
mercilessly
scourged
the
pretenders
of
the
earth
from
an
imaginary
point
of
vantage
on
the
moon
which
enabled
him
to
peer
down
into
their
secrets
lucian
description
of
the
appearance
of
the
earth
from
the
moon
shows
how
clearly
defined
in
his
day
had
become
the
conception
of
our
globe
as
only
an
atom
in
space
especially
did
it
occur
to
me
to
laugh
at
the
men
who
were
quarreling
about
the
boundaries
of
their
land
and
at
those
who
were
proud
because
they
cultivated
the
sikyonian
plain
or
owned
that
part
of
marathon
around
oenoe
or
held
possession
of
a
thousand
acres
at
acharnæ
of
the
whole
of
greece
as
it
then
appeared
to
me
from

being
about
the
size
of
four
fingers
i
think
attica
was
in

a

so
that
i
wondered
on

condition
it
was
left
to
these
rich

to
be

footnote

translation
such
scenes
as
lucian
beheld
in
imagination
upon
the
earth
while
looking
from
the
moon
many
would
fain
behold
with
telescopic
aid
upon
the
moon
while
looking
from
the
earth
galileo
believed
that
the
details
of
the
lunar
surface
revealed
by
his
telescope
closely
resembled
in
their
nature
the
features
of
the
earth
surface
and
for
a
long
time
as
the
telescope
continued
to
be
improved
observers
were
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
moon
possessed
not
only
mountains
and
plains
but
seas
and
oceans
also
it
was
the
discovery
that
the
moon
has
no
perceptible
atmosphere
that
first
seriously
undermined
the
theory
of
its
habitability
yet
as
was
remarked
in
the
introductory
chapter
there
has
of
late
been
some
change
of
view
concerning
a
lunar
atmosphere
but
the
change
has
been
not
so
much
in
the
ascertained
facts
as
in
the
way
of
looking
at
those
facts
but
before
we
discuss
this
matter
it
will
be
well
to
state
what
is
known
beyond
peradventure
about
the
moon
its
mean
distance
from
the
earth
is
usually
called
for
the
sake
of
a
round
number
miles
but
more
accurately
stated
it
is
miles
this
is
variable
to
the
extent
of
more
than
miles
on
account
of
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
and
the
eccentricity
itself
is
variable
in
consequence
of
the
perturbing
attractions
of
the
earth
and
the
sun
so
that
the
distance
of
the
moon
from
the
earth
is
continually
changing
it
may
be
as
far
away
as
miles
and
as
near
as
miles
although
the
orbit
of
the
moon
is
generally
represented
for
convenience
as
an
ellipse
about
the
earth
it
is
in
reality
a
varying
curve
having
the
sun
for
its
real
focus
and
always
concave
toward
the
latter
this
is
a
fact
that
can
be
more
readily
explained
with
the
aid
of
a
diagram
illustration
the
moon
path
with
respect
to
the
sun
and
the
earth
in
the
accompanying
cut
when
the
earth
is
at
the
moon
is
between
it
and
the
sun
in
the
phase
called
new
moon
at
this
point
the
orbit
about
the
sun
is
more
curved
than
the
moon
and
the
earth
is
moving
relatively
faster
than
the
moon
so
that
when
it
arrives
at
it
is
ahead
of
the
moon
and
we
see
the
latter
to
the
right
of
the
earth
in
the
phase
called
first
quarter
the
earth
being
at
this
time
ahead
of
the
moon
the
effect
of
its
attraction
combined
with
that
of
the
sun
tends
to
hasten
the
moon
onward
in
its
orbit
about
the
sun
and
the
moon
begins
to
travel
more
swiftly
until
it
overtakes
the
earth
at
and
appears
on
the
side
opposite
the
sun
in
the
phase
called
full
moon
at
this
point
the
moon
orbit
about
the
sun
has
a
shorter
radius
of
curvature
than
the
earth
in
traveling
from
to
the
moon
still
moves
more
rapidly
than
the
earth
and
having
passed
it
appears
at
to
the
left
of
the
earth
in
the
phase
called
third
quarter
now
the
earth
being
behind
the
moon
the
effect
of
its
attraction
combined
with
the
sun
tends
to
retard
the
moon
in
its
orbit
about
the
sun
with
the
result
that
the
moon
moves
again
less
rapidly
than
the
earth
and
the
latter
overtakes
it
so
that
upon
reaching
the
two
are
once
more
in
the
same
relative
positions
that
they
occupied
at
and
it
is
again
new
moon
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
although
the
real
orbit
of
the
moon
has
the
sun
for
its
center
of
revolution
nevertheless
in
consequence
of
the
attraction
of
the
earth
combined
in
varying
directions
with
that
of
the
sun
the
moon
once
every
month
makes
a
complete
circuit
of
our
globe
the
above
explanation
should
not
be
taken
for
a
mathematical
demonstration
of
the
moon
motion
but
simply
for
a
graphical
illustration
of
how
the
moon
appears
to
revolve
about
the
earth
while
really
obeying
the
sun
attraction
as
completely
as
the
earth
does
there
is
no
other
planet
that
has
a
moon
relatively
as
large
as
ours
the
moon
diameter
is
miles
its
volume
compared
with
the
earth
is
in
the
ratio
of
to
and
its
density
is
about
six
tenths
of
the
earth
this
makes
its
mass
to
that
of
our
globe
about
as
to
in
other
words
it
would
take
moons
to
counterbalance
the
earth
before
speaking
of
the
force
of
gravity
on
the
moon
we
will
examine
the
character
of
the
lunar
surface
to
the
naked
eye
the
moon
face
appears
variegated
with
dusky
patches
while
a
few
points
of
superior
brilliance
shine
amid
the
brighter
portions
especially
in
the
southern
and
eastern
quarters
where
immense
craters
like
tycho
and
copernicus
are
visible
to
a
keen
eye
gleaming
like
polished
buttons
with
a
telescope
even
of
moderate
power
the
surface
of
the
moon
presents
a
scene
of
astonishing
complexity
in
which
strangeness
beauty
and
grandeur
are
all
combined
the
half
of
the
moon
turned
earthward
contains
an
area
of
square
miles
a
little
greater
than
the
area
of
south
america
and
a
little
less
than
that
of
north
america
of
these
square
miles
about
square
miles
are
occupied
by
the
gray
or
dusky
expanses
called
in
lunar
geography
or
selenography
seas
whatever
they
may
once
have
been
they
are
not
now
seas
but
dry
plains
bordered
in
many
places
by
precipitous
cliffs
and
mountains
varied
in
level
by
low
ridges
and
regions
of
depression
intersected
occasionally
by
immense
cracks
having
the
width
and
depth
of
our
mightiest
river
cañons
and
sprinkled
with
bright
points
and
crater
pits
the
remaining
square
miles
are
mainly
occupied
by
mountains
of
the
most
extraordinary
character
owing
partly
to
roughness
of
the
surface
and
partly
to
more
brilliant
reflective
power
the
mountainous
regions
of
the
moon
appear
bright
in
comparison
with
the
plains
some
of
the
lunar
mountains
lie
in
long
massive
chains
with
towering
peaks
profound
gorges
narrow
valleys
vast
amphitheaters
and
beetling
precipices
looking
at
them
with
a
powerful
telescope
the
observer
might
well
fancy
himself
to
be
gazing
down
from
an
immense
height
into
the
heart
of
the
untraveled
himalayas
but
these
imposing
though
they
are
do
not
constitute
the
most
wonderful
feature
of
the
mountain
scenery
of
the
moon
appearing
sometimes
on
the
shores
of
the
seas
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
broad
plains
sometimes
along
the
course
of
mountain
chains
and
sometimes
in
magnificent
rows
following
for
hundreds
of
miles
the
meridians
of
the
lunar
globe
are
tremendous
circular
chasms
called
craters
frequently
they
have
in
the
middle
of
their
depressed
interior
floors
a
peak
or
a
cluster
of
peaks
their
inner
and
outer
walls
are
seamed
with
ridges
and
what
look
like
gigantic
streams
of
frozen
lava
surround
them
the
resemblance
that
they
bear
to
the
craters
of
volcanoes
is
at
first
sight
so
striking
that
probably
nobody
would
ever
have
thought
of
questioning
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
they
are
such
craters
but
for
their
incredible
magnitude
many
of
them
exceed
fifty
miles
in
diameter
and
some
of
them
sink
two
three
four
and
more
miles
below
the
loftiest
points
upon
their
walls
there
is
a
chasm
miles
long
and
broad
named
newton
situated
about
miles
from
the
south
pole
of
the
moon
whose
floor
lies
feet
below
the
summit
of
a
peak
that
towers
just
above
it
on
the
east
this
abyss
is
so
profound
that
the
shadows
of
its
enclosing
precipices
never
entirely
quit
it
and
the
larger
part
of
its
bottom
is
buried
in
endless
night
one
can
not
but
shudder
at
the
thought
of
standing
on
the
broken
walls
of
newton
and
gazing
down
into
a
cavity
of
such
stupendous
depth
that
if
chimborazo
were
thrown
into
it
the
head
of
the
mighty
andean
peak
would
be
thousands
of
feet
beneath
the
observer
a
different
example
of
the
crater
mountains
of
the
moon
is
the
celebrated
tycho
situated
in
latitude
about
south
corresponding
with
the
latitude
of
southern
new
zealand
on
the
earth
tycho
is
nearly
circular
and
a
little
more
than
miles
across
the
highest
point
on
its
wall
is
about
feet
above
the
interior
in
the
middle
of
its
floor
is
a
mountain
or
feet
high
tycho
is
especially
remarkable
for
the
vast
system
of
whitish
streaks
or
rays
which
starting
from
its
outer
walls
spread
in
all
directions
over
the
face
of
the
moon
many
of
them
running
without
deviation
hundreds
of
miles
across
mountains
craters
and
plains
these
rays
are
among
the
greatest
of
lunar
mysteries
and
we
shall
have
more
to
say
of
them

situated
about
north
of
the
equator
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
of
the
moon
is
another
wonderful
object
miles
in
diameter
a
polygon
appearing
when
not
intently
studied
as
a
circle

deep

low

resembling

but

within
the
edge
of
the
great
plain
named
the
or
ocean
of
storms
and
farther
east
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
is
a
smaller
crater
mountain
named
kepler
which
is
also
enveloped
by
a
whitish
area
covering
the
lunar
surface
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
extensive
outflows
of
lava
in
one
important
particular
the
crater
mountains
of
the
moon
differ
from
terrestrial
volcanoes
this
difference
is
clearly
described
by
nasmyth
and
carpenter
in
their
book
on
the
moon
while
the
terrestrial
crater
is
generally
a
hollow
on
a
mountain
top
with
its
flat
bottom
high
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
country
those
upon
the
moon
have
their
lowest
points
depressed
more
or
less
deeply
below
the
general
surface
of
the
moon
the
external
height
being
frequently
only
a
half
or
one
third
of
the
internal
depth
it
has
been
suggested
that
these
gigantic
rings
are
only
basal
wrecks
of
volcanic
mountains
whose
conical
summits
have
been
blown
away
leaving
vast
crateriform
hollows
where
the
mighty
peaks
once
stood
but
the
better
opinion
seems
to
be
that
which
assumes
that
the
rings
were
formed
by
volcanic
action
very
much
as
we
now
see
them
if
such
a
crater
as
copernicus
or
the
still
larger
one
named
theophilus
which
is
situated
in
the
western
hemisphere
of
the
moon
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
of
nectar
ever
had
a
conical
mountain
rising
from
its
rim
the
height
attained
by
the
peak
if
the
average
slope
were
about
would
have
been
truly
stupendous
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
there
is
a
kind
of
ring
mountains
found
in
many
places
on
the
moon
whose
forms
and
surroundings
do
not
as
the
craters
heretofore
described
do
suggest
at
first
sight
a
volcanic
origin
these
are
rather
level
plains
of
an
oval
or
circular
outline
enclosed
by
a
wall
of
mountains
the
finest
example
is
perhaps
the
plato
situated
in
of
north
latitude
near
an
immense
mountain
uplift
named
the
lunar
alps
and
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
or
sea
of
showers
plato
appears
as
an
oval
plain
very
smooth
and
level
about
miles
in
length
and
completely
surrounded
by
mountains
quite
precipitous
on
the
inner
side
and
rising
in
their
highest
peaks
to
an
elevation
of
to
feet
enclosed
plains
bearing
more
or
less
resemblance
to
plato
sometimes
smooth
within
and
sometimes
broken
with
small
peaks
and
craters
or
hilly
ridges
are
to
be
found
scattered
over
almost
all
parts
of
the
moon
if
our
satellite
was
ever
an
inhabited
world
like
the
earth
while
its
surface
was
in
its
present
condition
these
valleys
must
have
presented
an
extraordinary
spectacle
it
has
been
thought
that
they
may
once
have
been
filled
with
water
forming
lakes
that
recall

illustration
the

at

it
is
not
my
intention
to
give
a
complete
description
of
the
various
lunar
features
and
i
mention
but
one
other
the
clefts
or
rills
which
are
to
be
seen
running
across
the
surface
like
cracks
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
these
is
found
in
the
near
the
aristarchus
which
is
famed
for
the
intense
brilliance
of
its
central
peak
whose
reflective
power
is
so
great
that
it
was
once
supposed
to
be
aflame
with
volcanic
fire
the
cleft
or
crack
in
question
is
very
erratic
in
its
course
and
many
miles
in
length
and
it
terminates
in
a
ringed
plain
named
herodotus
not
far
east
of
aristarchus
breaking
through
the
wall
of
the
plain
and
entering
the
interior
many
other
similar
chasms
or
cañons
exist
on
the
moon
some
crossing
plains
some
cleaving
mountain
walls
and
some
forming
a
network
of
intersecting
clefts
thomas
gwyn
elger
has
this
to
say
on
the
subject
of
the
lunar
clefts
if
as
seems
most
probable
these
gigantic
cracks
are
due
to
contractions
of
the
moon
surface
it
is
not
impossible
in
spite
of
the
assertions
of
the
to
the
effect
that
our
satellite
is
now
a
world
that
emanations
may
proceed
from
these
fissures
even
if
under
the
monthly
alternations
of
extreme
temperatures
surface
changes
do
not
now
occasionally
take
place
from
this
cause
also
should
this
be
so
the
appearance
of
new
rills
and
the
extension
and
modification
of
those
already
existing
may
reasonably
be
looked
for
elger
then
proceeds
to
describe
his
discovery
in
in
the
mersenius
of
a
cleft
never
noticed
before
and
which
seems
to
have
been
of
recent
formation

gravity
this
we
find
to
be
only
one
sixth
as
great
as
gravity
on

it
is
by
far
the

force
of

the
moon
could
attain
a
height
of
feet
without
being
relatively
more
unwieldy
than
a
descendant
of
adam
is
on
the
earth
whether
this
furnishes
a
sound
reason
for
assuming
that
the
lunar
inhabitants
if
any
exist
or
have
ever
existed
should
be
preposterous
giants
is
questionable
yet
such
an
assumption
receives
a
certain
degree
of
support
from
the
observed
fact
that
the
natural
features
of
the
moon
are
framed
on
an
exaggerated
scale
as
compared
with
the
earth
we
have
just
observed
that
the
moon
is
characterized
by
vast
mountain
rings
attaining
in
many
cases
a
diameter
exceeding
fifty
miles
if
these
are
volcanic
craters
it
is
evident
at
a
glance
that
the
mightiest
volcanoes
of
the
earth
fall
into
insignificance
beside
them
now
the
slight
force
of
gravity
on
the
moon
has
been
appealed
to
as
a
reason
why
volcanic
explosions
on
the
lunar
globe
should
produce
incomparably
greater
effects
than
upon
the
earth
where
the
ejected
materials
are
so
much
heavier
the
same
force
that
would
throw
a
volcanic
bomb
a
mile
high
on
the
earth
could
throw
it
six
miles
high
on
the
moon
the
giant
cannon
that
we
have
placed
in
one
of
our
coast
forts
which
is
said
to
be
able
to
hurl
a
projectile
to
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
could
send
the
same
projectile
ninety
miles
on
the
moon
an
athlete
who
can
clear
a
horizontal
bar
at
a
height
of
six
feet
on
the
earth
could
clear
the
same
bar
at
a
height
of
feet
on
the
moon
in
other
words
he
could
jump
over
a
house
unless
indeed
the
lunarians
really
are
giants
and
live
in
houses
proportioned
to
their
own
dimensions
and
to
the
size
of
their
mountains
in
that
case
our
athlete
would
have
to
content
himself
with
jumping
over
a
lunarian
whose
head
he
could
just
clear
with
the
hat
off
these
things
are
not
only
amusing
but
important
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
force
of
gravity
on
the
moon
actually
is
as
slight
as
it
has
just
been
described
so
even
without
calling
in
imaginary
inhabitants
to
lend
it
interest
the
comparative
inability
of
the
moon
to
arrest
bodies
in
motion
becomes
a
fact
of
much
significance
it
has
led
to
the
theory
that
meteorites
may
have
originally
been
shot
out
of
the
moon
great
volcanoes
when
those
volcanoes
were
active
and
may
have
circulated
about
the
sun
until
various
perturbations
have
brought
them
down
upon
the
earth
a
body
shot
radially
from
the
surface
of
the
moon
would
need
to
have
a
velocity
of
only
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
a
second
in
order
to
escape
from
the
moon
control
and
we
can
believe
that
a
lunar
volcano
when
in
action
could
have
imparted
such
a
velocity
all
the
more
readily
because
with
modern
gunpowders
we
have
been
able
to
give
to
projectiles
a
speed
one
half
as
great
as
that
needed
for
liberation
from
lunar
gravity
another
consequence
of
the
small
gravitative
power
of
the
moon
bears
upon
the
question
of
atmosphere
according
to
the
theory
of
johnstone
stoney
heretofore
referred
to
oxygen
nitrogen
and
water
vapor
would
all
gradually
escape
from
the
moon
if
originally
placed
upon
it
because
by
the
kinetic
theory
the
maximum
velocities
of
their
molecules
are
greater
than
a
mile
and
a
half
per
second
the
escape
would
not
occur
instantly
nor
all
at
once
for
it
would
be
only
the
molecules
at
the
upper
surface
of
the
atmosphere
which
were
moving
with
their
greatest
velocity
and
in
a
direction
radial
to
the
center
of
the
moon
that
would
get
away
but
in
the
course
of
time
this
gradual
leakage
would
result
in
the
escape
of
all
of
those
gases
footnote
the
discovery
of
free
hydrogen
in
the
earth
atmosphere
by
professor
dewar
bears
upon
the
theory
of
the
escape
of
gases
from
a
planet
and
may
modify
the
view
above
expressed
since
hydrogen
is
theoretically
incapable
of
being
permanently
retained
in
the
free
state
by
the
earth
its
presence
in
the
atmosphere
indicates
either
that
there
is
an
influx
from
space
or
that
it
emanates
from
the
crust
in
a
similar
way
it
may
be
assumed
that
atmospheric
gases
can
be
given
off
from
the
crust
of
the
moon
thus
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
supplying
the
place
of
the
molecules
that
escape
after
it
had
been
found
that
to
ordinary
tests
the
moon
offered
no
evidence
of
the
possession
of
an
atmosphere
and
before
theory
was
broached
it
was
supposed
by
many
that
the
moon
had
lost
its
original
supply
of
air
by
absorption
into
its
interior
the
oxygen
was
supposed
to
have
entered
into
combination
with
the
cooling
rocks
and
minerals
thus
being
withdrawn
from
the
atmosphere
and
the
nitrogen
was
imagined
to
have
disappeared
also
within
the
lunar
crust
for
it
seems
to
have
always
been
tacitly
assumed
that
the
phenomenon
to
be
accounted
for
was
not
so
much
the
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
as
its
but
disappearance
of
course
implies
previous
existence
in
like
manner
it
has
always
been
a
commonly
accepted
view
that
the
moon
probably
once
had
enough
water
to
form
lakes
and
seas
these
it
has
been
calculated
could
have
been
absorbed
into
the
lunar
globe
as
it
cooled
off
but
johnstone
stoney
theory
offers
another
method
by
which
they
could
have
escaped
through
evaporation
and
the
gradual
flight
of
the
molecules
into
open
space
possibly
both
methods
have
been
in
operation
a
portion
of
the
constituents
of
the
former
atmosphere
and
oceans
having
entered
into
chemical
combinations
in
the
lunar
crust
and
the
remainder
having
vanished
in
consequence
of
the
lack
of
sufficient
gravitative
force
to
retain
them
but
why
it
may
be
asked
should
it
be
assumed
that
the
moon
ever
had
things
which
it
does
not
now
possess
perhaps
no
entirely
satisfactory
reply
can
be
made
some
observers
have
believed
that
they
detected
unmistakable
indications
of
alluvial
deposits
on
lunar
plains
and
of
the
existence
of
beaches
on
the
shores
of
the
seas
loewy
and
puiseux
of
the
paris
observatory
whose
photographs
of
the
moon
are
perhaps
the
finest
yet
made
say
on
this
subject
there
exists
from
the
point
of
view
of
relief
a
general
similarity
between
the
of
the
moon
and
the
plateaux
which
are
covered
by
terrestrial
oceans
in
these
convex
surfaces
are
more
frequent
than
concave
basins
thrown
back
usually
toward
the
verge
of
the
depressed
space
in
the
same
way
the
of
the
moon
present
generally
at
the
edges
rather
pronounced
depressions
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
we
observe
normal
deformations
of
a
shrinking
globe
shielded
from
the
erosive
action
of
rain
which
tends
on
the
contrary
in
all
the
abundantly
watered
parts
of
the
earth
to
make
the
concave
surfaces
predominate
the
explanation
of
this
structure
such
as
is
admitted
at
present
by
geologists
seems
to
us
equally
valid
for
the
moon

it
might
be
urged
that
there
is
evidence
of
former
volcanic
activity
on
the
moon
of
such
a
nature
that
explosions
of
steam
must
have
played
a
part
in
the
phenomena
and
if
there
was
steam
of
course
there
was
water
but
perhaps
the
most
convincing
argument
tending
to
show
that
the
moon
once
had
a
supply
of
water
of
which
some
remnant
may
yet
remain
below
the
surface
of
the
lunar
globe
is
based
upon
the
probable
similarity
in
composition
of
the
earth
and
the
moon
this
similarity
results
almost
equally
whether
we
regard
the
moon
as
having
originated
in
a
ring
of
matter
left
off
from
the
contracting
mass
that
became
the
earth
or
whether
we
accept
the
suggestion
of
darwin
that
the
moon
is
the
veritable
offspring
of
the
earth
brought
into
being
by
the
assistance
of
the
tidal
influence
of
the
sun
the
latter
hypothesis
is
the
more
picturesque
of
the
two
and
at
present
is
probably
the
more
generally
favored
it
depends
upon
the
theory
of
tidal
friction
which
was
referred
to
in

offering
an
explanation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
rotation
of
the
planet
mercury
has
been
slowed
down
until
its
rotary
period
coincides
with
that
of
its

the
gist
of
the
hypothesis
in
question
is
that
at
a
very
early
period
in
its
history
when
the
earth
was
probably
yet
in
a
fluid
condition
it
rotated
with
extreme
rapidity
on
its
axis
and
was
at
the

time
greatly
agitated
by
the
tidal
attraction
of
the

detached

the

of

as
the

the

one
of
the
most
interesting
facts
about
the

is
that
its

affords
evidence
of
a
cataclysm
which
has
wiped
out
many
and
perhaps
nearly
all
of
the
records
of
its

destroying

the
accumulated
results

progress

on
the

these
effects
have
been
transcendent
the
story
of
the
tremendous
disaster
that
overtook
the

is
partly
written
in
its
giant
volcanoes
although
it
may
be
true
as
some
maintain
that
there
is

volcanic
action
going
on
upon

it
is
evident
that
such

must
be
insignificant
in

is
a
spot
in
the

on

of

a
feeling
of
awe
and
almost
of
shrinking

within
a

about
miles

is
an
exhibition
of
the
most
terrifying
effects

note

upon

the

also
notice

this
is
only
one
example
among
hundreds
scattered
all
over
the

which
show
how
the

has
suffered
upheaval
after
upheaval
it
is
possible
that
some
of
the
small
craters
not
included
within
the
walls
of
the
greater
ones
may
represent
an
early
stage
in
the
era
of
volcanic
activity
that
wrecked
the
moon
but
where
larger
and
smaller
are
grouped
together
a
certain
progression
can
be
seen
tending
finally
to
extinction
the
internal
energies
reached
a
maximum
and
then
fell
off
in
strength
until
they
died
out
completely
it
can
hardly
be
supposed
that
the
phase
of
lunar
history
if
there
ever
was
one
could
survive
the
outbreak
of
the

cataclysm
north
america

subjected
to
such
an
experience

continental
areas

be
in
proportion
worse
wrecked
than
the
most
fearfully
battered
steel
victim
of
a
modern
sea
fight
and
one
can
readily
understand
that
in
such
circumstances
those
now
beautiful
and
populous
continents
would
exhibit
from
a
distance
scarcely
any
token
of
their

say
nothing

there
are
other

to
be
had
of
an
older
world
in

that

beautified
for
us

a
broad
semicircular
bay
whose
shores
are
formed
by
the

named
fracastorius
it
is
evident
that
this
bay
and
the
larger
part
of
the
sea
of
nectar
have
been
created
by
an
outwelling
of
liquid
lavas
which
formed
a
smooth
floor
over
a
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
broke
down
and
submerged
a
large
part
of
the
mountain
ring
of
fracastorius
leaving
the
more
ancient
walls
standing
at
the
southern
end
while
outlined
by

and
corrugations
in
the
rocky

are
certain
forms
belonging

the

assume

its
great
volcanic
outburst
must
have
ceased
at
that
time
yet
the
possibility
may
be
admitted
that
life
could
reappear
upon
the
moon
after
its
surface
had
again
become
quiet
and
comparatively
undisturbed
germs
of
the
earlier
life
might
have
survived
despite
the
terrible
nature
of
the
catastrophe
but
the
conditions
on
the
moon
at
present
are
such
that
even
the
most
confident
advocates
of
the
view
that
the
lunar
world
is
not
entirely
dead
do
not
venture
to
assume
that
anything
beyond
the
lowest
and
simplest
organic
forms
mainly
if
not
wholly
in
the
shape
of
vegetation
can
exist
there
the
impression
that
even
such
life
is
possible
rests
upon
the

william
pickering
who
is
perhaps
more
familiar
with
the
telescopic
and
photographic
aspects
of
the
moon
than
any
other
american
astronomer
has
recorded
numberless
instances
of
change
in
minute
details
of
the
lunar
landscapes
he
regards
some
of
his
observations
made
at
arequipa
as
pointing
very
strongly
to
the
existence
of
vegetation
upon
the
surface
of
the
moon
in
large
quantities
at
the
present
time
the
valley
of
plato
is
one
of
the
places
in
the
lunar
world
where
the
visible
changes
have
been
most
frequently
observed
and
more
than
one
student
of
the
moon
has
reached
the
conclusion
that
something
very
like
the
appearances
that
vegetation
would
produce
is
to
be
seen
in
that
valley
professor
pickering
has
thoroughly
discussed
the
observations
relating
to
a
celebrated
crater
named
linné
in
the
and
after
reading
his
description
of
its
changes
of
appearance
one
can
hardly
reject
his
conclusion
that
linné
is
an
active
volcanic
vent
but
variable
in
its
manifestations
this
is
only
one
of
a
number
of
similar
instances
among
the
smaller
craters
of
the
moon
the
giant
ones
are
evidently
entirely
extinct
but
some
of
the
minor
vents
give
occasional
signs
of
activity
nor
should
it
be
assumed
that
these
relatively
slight
manifestations
of
volcanic
action
are
really
insignificant
as
professor
pickering
shows
they
may
be
regarded
as
comparable
with
the
greatest
volcanic
phenomena
now
witnessed
on
the
earth
and
speaking
again
of
plato
he
says
of
its
evidences
of
volcanic
action
it
is
i
believe
more
active
than
any
area
of
similar
size
upon
the
earth
there
seems
to
be
no
evidences
of
lava
but
the
white
streaks
indicate
apparently
something
analogous
to
snow
or
clouds
there
must
be
a
certain
escape
of
gases
presumably
steam
and
carbonic
acid
the
former
of
which
probably
aids
in
the
production
of
the
white
markings

to

we
owe
the
suggestion
that
the
wonderful
rays
emanating
from
tycho
consist
of
some
whitish
substance
blown
by
the
wind
not
from
tycho
itself
but
from
lines
of
little
volcanic
vents
or
craters
lying
along
the
course
of
the
rays
this
substance
may
be
volcanic
powder
or
snow
in
the
form
of
minute
ice
crystals
elger
remarks
of
this
theory
that
the
confused
network
of
streaks
around
copernicus
seems
to
respond
to
it
more
happily
than
the
rays
of
tycho
do
because
of
the
lack
of
definiteness
of
direction
so
manifest
in
the
case
of
the
rays
as
an
encouragement
to
amateur
observers
who
may
be
disposed
to
find
out
for
themselves
whether
or
not

the

will
prove
useful
and
interesting
in
reviewing
the
history
of
selenography
one
must
be
impressed
by
the
singular
fact
that
while
most
of
the
astronomers
who
have
made
a
special
study
of
the
moon
such
as
schroeter
maedler
schmidt
webb
neison
and
elger
have
all
believed
that
its
surface
was
still
subject
to
changes
readily
visible
from
the
earth
the
great
majority
of
astronomers
who
have
paid
little
attention
to
the
subject
have
quite
as
strenuously
denied
the
existence
of
such
changes
in
regard
to
the
lunar
atmosphere
it
may
be
said
in
a
word
that
even
those
who
advocate
the
existence
of
vegetation
and
of
clouds
of
dust
or
ice
crystals
on
the
moon
do
not
predicate
any
greater
amount
or
greater
density
of
atmosphere
than
do
those
who
consider
the
moon
to
be
wholly
dead
and
inert
professor
pickering
himself
showed
from
his
observations
that
the
horizontal
refraction
of
the
lunar
atmosphere
instead
of
being
less
than
as
formerly
stated
was
less
than
yet
he
found
visual
evidence
that
on
the
sunlit
side
of
the
moon
this
rare
atmosphere
was
filled
to
a
height
of
four
miles
with
some
absorbing
medium
which
was
absent
on
the
dark
side
and
which
was
apparently
an
emanation
from
the
lunar
crust
occurring
after
sunrise
and
loewy
and
puiseux
of
the
paris
observatory
say
after
showing
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
great
volcanic
eruptions
belong
to
a
recent
period
in
the
history
of
the
moon
that
the
diffusion
of
cinders
to
great
distances
infers
a
gaseous
envelope
of
a
certain
density
the
resistance
of
the
atmosphere
must
have
been
sufficient
to
retard
the
fall
of
this
dust
the
reference
is
to
the

those
from

we
come
now
to
a
brief
consideration
of
certain
peculiarities
in
the
motions
of
the
moon
and
in
the
phenomena
of
day
and
night
on
its
surface
the
moon
keeps
the
same
side
forever
turned
toward
the
earth
behaving
in
this
respect
as
mercury
does
with
regard
to
the
sun
the
consequence
is
that
the
lunar
globe
makes
but
one
rotation
on
its
axis
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
in
the
course
of
one
revolution
about
the
earth
some
of
the
results
of
this
practical
identity
of
the
periods
of
rotation
and
revolution
are
illustrated
in
the
diagram
on
page
the
moon
really
undergoes
considerable
libration
recalling
the
libration
of
mercury
which
was
explained
in
the
chapter
on
that
planet
and
in
consequence
we
are
able
to
see
a
little
way
round
into
the
opposite
lunar
hemisphere
now
on
this
side
and
now
on
the
other
but
in
the
diagram
this
libration
has
been
neglected
if
it
had
been
represented
we
should
have
found
that
instead
of
only
one
half
about
three
fifths
of
the

of
the

are
visible
from

phases

rotation
of
the
moon
perhaps
it
should
be
remarked
that
in
drawing
the
moon
orbit
about
the
earth
as
a
center
we
offer
no
contradiction
to
what
was
shown
earlier
in
this
chapter
the
moon
does
travel
around
the
earth
and
its
orbit
about
our
globe
may
for
our
present
purpose
be
treated
independently
of
its
motion
about
the
sun
let
the
central
globe
then
represent
the
earth
and
let
the
sun
be
supposed
to
shine
from
the
side
of
the
diagram
a
little
cross
is
erected
at
a
fixed
spot
on
the
globe
of
the
moon
at
the
moon
is
between
the
earth
and
the
sun
or
in
the
phase
of
new
moon
the
lunar
hemisphere
facing
the
earth
is
now
buried
in
night
except
so
far
as
the
light
reflected
from
the
earth
illuminates
it
and
this
illumination
it
is
interesting
to
remember
is
about
fourteen
times
as
great
reckoned
by
the
relative
areas
of
the
reflecting
surfaces
as
that
which
the
full
moon
sends
to
the
earth
an
inhabitant
of
the
moon
standing
beside
the
cross
sees
the
earth
in
the
form
of
a
huge
full
moon
directly
above
his
head
but
as
far
as
the
sun
is
concerned
it
is
midnight
for
him
in
the
course
of
about
seven
days
the
moon
travels
to
in
the
meantime
it
has
turned
one
quarter
of
the
way
around
its
axis
and
the
spot
marked
by
the
cross
is
still
directly
under
the
earth
for
the
lunar
inhabitant
standing
on
that
spot
the
sun
is
now
on
the
point
of
rising
and
he
sees
the
earth
no
longer
in
the
shape
of
a
full
moon
but
in
that
of
a
the
lunar
globe
itself
appears
at
the
same
time
from
the
earth
as
a
being
in
the
position
or
phase
that
we
call
first
quarter
seven
more
days
elapse
and
the
moon
arrives
at
opposite
to
the
position
of
the
sun
and
with
the
earth
between
it
and
the
solar
orb
it
is
now
high
noon
for
our
lunarian
standing
beside
the
cross
while
the
earth
over
his
head
appears
if
he
sees
it
at
all
only
as
a
black
disk
close
to
the
sun
or
as
would
sometimes
be
the
case
covering
the
sun
and
encircled
with
a
beautiful
ring
of
light
produced
by
the
refraction
of
its
atmosphere
recall
the
similar
phenomenon
in
the
case
of
venus
the
moon
seen
from
the
earth
is
now
in
the
phase
called
full
moon
another
lapse
of
seven
days
and
the
moon
is
at
in
the
phase
called
third
quarter
while
the
earth
viewed
from
the
cross
on
the
moon
which
is
still
pointed
directly
at
it
appears
again
in
the
shape
of
a
huge
during
the
next
seven
days
the
moon
returns
to
its
original
position
at
and
becomes
once
more
new
moon
with
full
earth
shining
upon
it
now
it
is
evident
that
in
consequence
of
the
peculiar
law
of
the
rotation
its
days
and
nights
are
each
about
two
of
our
weeks
or
fourteen
days
in
length
that
hemisphere
of
the
moon
which
is
in
the
full
sunlight
at
for
instance
is
buried
in
the
middle
of
night
at
the
result
is
different
than
in
the
case
of
mercury
because
the
body
toward
which
the
moon
always
keeps
the
same
face
directed
is
not
the
luminous
sun
but
the
earth
it
is
believed
that
the
moon
acquired
this
manner
of
rotation
in
consequence
of
the
tidal
friction
exercised
upon
it
by
the
earth
the
tidal
attraction
of
the
earth
exceeds
that
of
the
sun
upon
the
moon
because
the
earth
is
so
much
nearer
than
the
sun
is
and
tidal
attraction
varies
inversely
as
the
cube
of
the
distance
in
fact
the
braking
effect
of
tidal
friction
varies
inversely
as
the
sixth
power
of
the
distance
so
that
the
ability
of
the
earth
to
stop
the
rotation
of
the
moon
on
its
axis
is
immensely
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
this
power
was
effectively
applied
while
the
moon
was
yet
a
molten
mass
so
that
it
is
probable
that
the
moon
has
rotated
just
as
it
does
now
for
millions
of
years
as
was
remarked
a
little
while
ago
the
moon
traveling
in
an
elliptical
orbit
about
the
earth
has
a
libratory
movement
which
if
represented
in
our
picture
would
cause
the
cross
to
swing
now
a
little
one
way
and
now
a
little
the
other
and
thus
produce
an
apparent
pendulum
motion
of
the
earth
in
the
sky
similar
to
that
of
the
sun
as
seen
from
mercury
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
the
details
of
this
phenomenon
the
reader
if
he
chooses
can
deduce
them
for
himself
but
we
may
inquire
a
little
into
the
effects
of
the
long
days
and
nights
of
the
moon
in
consequence
of
the
extreme
rarity
of
the
lunar
atmosphere
it
is
believed
that
the
heat
of
the
sun
falling
upon
it
during
a
day
two
weeks
in
length
is
radiated
away
so
rapidly
that
the
surface
of
the
lunar
rocks
never
rises
above
the
freezing
temperature
of
water
on
the
night
side
with
no
warm
atmospheric
blanket
such
as
the
earth
enjoys
the
temperature
may
fall
far
toward
absolute
zero
the
most
merciful
figure
that
has
been
suggested
for
it
being
below
the
zero
of
our
ordinary
thermometers
but
there
is
much
uncertainty
about
the
actual
temperature
on
the
moon
and
different
experiments
in
the
attempt
to
make
a
direct
measurement
of
it
have
yielded
discordant
results
at
one
time
for
instance
lord
rosse
believed
he
had
demonstrated
that
at
lunar
noon
the
temperature
of
the
rocks
rose
above
the
of
water
but
afterward
he
changed
his
mind
and
favored
the
theory
of
a
low
temperature
in
this
and
in
other
respects
much
remains
to
be
discovered
concerning
our
interesting
satellite
and
there
is
plenty
of
room
and
an
abundance
of
original
occupation

new

the

are
the
main
things
to
be
noticed
right
ascension
by
the
way
expresses
the
distance
of
a
celestial
body
such
as
a
star
or
a
planet
east
of
the
vernal
equinox
or
the
first
point
of
aries
which
is
an
arbitrary
point
on
the
equator
of
the
heavens
which
serves
like
the
meridian
of
greenwich
on
the
earth
as
a
for
reckoning
longitude
the
entire
circuit
of
the
heavens
along
the
equator
is
divided
into
hours
of
right
ascension
each
hour
covering
of
space
if
a
planet
then
is
in
right
ascension
usually
printed
for
short
it
is
on
the
meridian
of
the
vernal
equinox
or
the
celestial
greenwich
if
it
is
in
it
will
be
found
east
of

the

north

of

with
these
explanations
we
may
proceed
to
find
a
planet
by
the
aid
of
the
nautical
almanac
and
our
charts
i
take
for
example
the
ephemeris
for
the
year
and
i
look
under
the
heading
jupiter
on
page
for
the
month
of
july
opposite
the
day
of
the
month
i
find
the
right
ascension
to
be
neglecting
the
seconds
now
minutes
are
so
near
to
half
an
hour
that
for
our
purposes
we
may
say
jupiter
is
in
i
set
this
down
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
then
examine
the
declination
column
where
i
find
that
on
july
jupiter
is
in
south
declination
the
sign
meaning
south
as
before
explained
which
is
almost
and
for
our
purposes
we
may
call
this
which
is
what
i
set
down
on
my
slip
illustration
chart
no
from
right
ascension
hours
to

declination
north
to

next
i
turn
to
chart
no
in
this
chapter
where
i
find
the
meridian
line
of
running
through
the
center
of
the
chart
i
know
that
jupiter
is
to
be
looked
for
about
east
or
to
the
left
of
that
line
at
the
bottom
and
top
of
the
chart
every
twenty
minutes
of
is
indicated
so
that
it
is
easy
with
the
eye
or
with
the
aid
of
a
ruler
to
place
the
vertical
line
at
some
point
of
which
jupiter
is
to
be
found
illustration
chart
no
from
right
ascension
hours
to
hours
declination
north
to
south
then
i
consult
my
note
of
the
declination
of
the
planet
it
is
south
on
the
vertical
borders
of
the
chart
i
find
the
figures
of
the
declination
and
i
observe
that
which
represents
the
equator
of
the
heavens
is
near
the
top
of
the
chart
while
each
parallel
horizontal
line
across
the
chart
indicates
north
or
south
of
its
next
neighbor
next
to
the
bottom
of
the
chart
i
find
the
parallel
of
and
i
see
that
every
five
degrees
is
indicated
by
the
figures
at
the
sides
by
the
eye
or
with
the
aid
of
a
ruler
i
easily
estimate
where
the
horizontal
line
of
would
fall
and
since
is
the
third
of
a
degree
i
perceive
that
it
is
for
the
rough
purpose
of
merely
finding
a
conspicuous
planet
negligible
although
it
too
can
be
included
in
the
estimate
if
thought
desirable
having
already
found
the
vertical
line
on
which
jupiter
is
placed
and
having
now
found
the
horizontal
line
also
i
have
simply
to
regard
their
crossing
point
which
will
be
the
situation
of
the
planet
among
the
stars
i
note
that
it
is
in
the
constellation
sagittarius
in
a
certain
position
with
reference
to
a
familiar
group
of
stars
in
that
constellation
and
when
i
look
at
the
heavens
there
in
the
place
thus
indicated
jupiter
stands
revealed
illustration
chart

declination
north
to
south
the
reader
will
readily
perceive
that
in
a
precisely
similar
manner
any
planet
can
be
located
at
any
time
of
the
year
and
at
any
point
in
its
course
about
the
heavens
but
it
may
turn
out
that
the
place
occupied
by
the
planet
is
too
near
the
sun
to
render
it
easily
or
at
all
visible
such
a
case
can
be
recognized
either
from
a
general
knowledge
of
the
location
of
the
constellations
at
various
seasons
or
with
the
aid
of
the
nautical
almanac
where
at
the
beginning
of
each
set
of
monthly
tables
in
the
calendar
the
sun
right
ascension
and
declination
will
be
found
in
locating
the
sun
if
you
find
that
its
right
ascension
differs
by
less
than
an
hour
one
way
or
the
other
from
that
of
the
planet
sought
it
is
useless
to
look
for
the
latter
if
the
planet
is
situated
west
of
the
sun
to
the
right
on
the
chart
then
it
is
to
be
looked
for
in
the
east
before
sunrise
but
if
it
is
east
of
the
sun
to
the
left
on
the
chart
then
you
must
seek
it
in
the
west
after
sunset
for
instance
i
look
for
the
planet
mercury
on
october
i
find
its
to
be
and
its
looking
at
the
place
for
october
i
find
it
to
be
and
placing
them
both
on
chart
no
i
discover
that
mercury
is
well
to
the
east
or
left
hand
of
the
sun
and
will
consequently
be
visible
in
the
western
sky
after
sundown
additional
guidance
will
be
found
by
noting
the
following
facts
about
the
charts
the
meridian
the
north
and
south
line
runs
through
the
middle
of
chart
no
between

note
well
also
these
particulars
about
the
charts
chart

includes
the
first
four
hours
of

from

inclusive
chart
no
includes

no

no

no

and
chart
no

which
completes
the
circuit
in
the
first
three
charts
the
line
of
or
the
equator
is
found
near
the
bottom
and
in
the
last
three
near
the
top
this
is
a
matter
of
convenience
in
arrangement
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
ecliptic
which
and
not
the
equator
marks
the
center
of
the
zodiac
indicates
the
position
of
the
tracks
of
the
planets
among
the
stars
and
the
ecliptic
being
inclined
to
the
plane
of
the
equator
lies
half
to
the
north
and
half
to
the
south
of
the
latter
those
who
after
all
may
not
care
to
consult
the
ephemeris
in
order
to
find
the
planets
may
be
able
to
locate
them
simply
from
a
knowledge
of
their
situation
among
the
constellations
some
ordinary
almanacs
tell
in
what
constellations
the
principal
planets
are
to
be
found
at
various
times
of
the
year
having
once
found
them
in
this
way
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
keep
track
of
them
thereafter
through
a
general
knowledge
of
their
movements
jupiter
for
instance
requiring
a
period
of
nearly
twelve
years
to
make
a
single
journey
around
the
sun
moves
about
eastward
among
the
stars
every
year
the
zodiacal
constellations
are
roughly
about
in
length
and
as
jupiter
was
in
sagittarius
in
he
will
be
in
capricornus
in
saturn
requiring
nearly
thirty
years
for
a
revolution
around
the
sun
moves
only
between
and
eastward
every
year
and
being
in
conjunction
with
jupiter
in
sagittarius
in
does
not
get
beyond
the
border
of
that
constellation
in
jupiter
having
been
in
opposition
to
the
sun
june
will
be
similarly
placed
early
in
august
the
time
from
one
opposition
of
jupiter
to
the
next
being
days
saturn
passes
from
one
opposition
to
the
next
in
days
so
that
having
been
in
that
position
july
it
reaches
it
again
about
july
mars
requires
about
days
to
complete
a
revolution
and
comes
into
conjunction
with
the
earth
or
opposition
to
the
sun
the
best
position
for
observation
on
the
average
once
every
days
mars
was
in
opposition
near
the
end
of
february
and
some
of
its
future
oppositions
will
be
in
march
may
july
and
september
the
oppositions
of
and
will
be
unusually
favorable
ones
for
they
will
occur
when
the
planet
is
comparatively
near
the
earth
when
a
planet
is
in
opposition
to
the
sun
it
is
on
the
meridian
the
north
and
south
line
at
midnight
mercury
and
venus
being
nearer
the
sun
than
the
earth
is
can
never
be
seen
very
far
from
the
place
of
the
sun
itself
venus
recedes
much
farther
from
the
solar
orb
than
mercury
does
but
both
are
visible
only
in
the
sunset
or
the
sunrise
sky
all
almanacs
tell
at
what
times
these
planets
play
their
respective
rôles
as
morning
or
as
evening
stars
in
the
case
of
mercury
about
days
on
the
average
elapse
between
its
reappearances
in
the
case
of
venus
about
days
the
latter
for
instance
having
become
an
evening
star
at
the
end
of
april
will
become
an
evening
star
again
in
december
with
the
aid
of
the
nautical
almanac
and
the
charts
the
amateur
will
find
no
difficulty
after
a
little
practise
in
keeping
track
of
any
of
the
planets
in
the
back
part
of
the
nautical
almanac
will
be
found
two
pages
headed
phenomena
planetary
configurations
with
the
aid
of
these
the
student
can
determine
the
position
of
the
planets
with
respect
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
with
respect
to
one
another
the
meaning
of
the
various
symbols
used
in
the
tables
will
be
found
explained
on
a
page
facing
the
calendar
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
from
these
tables
among
other
things
the
times
of
greatest
elongation
from
the
sun
of
the
planets
mercury
and
venus
can
be
found
it
may
be
added
that
only
bright
stars
and
stars
easily
seen
are
included
in
the
charts
and
there
will
be
no
danger
of
mistaking
any
of
these
stars
for
a
planet
if
the
observer
first
carefully
learns
to
recognize
their
configurations
neither
mars

eggleston
is

reliable
reporter

but
he
is
also
an
exceedingly
keen
critic
he
writes
history
without
the
effort
to
merge
the
critic
in

historian
his
sense

humor
is
never
dormant
he
renders
some
of
the
dullest
passages
in

actually
amusing
by
his
witty
treatment
of

he
finds
a
laugh
for
his

where
most

have
found
yawns
and
with

he
does
not

will
commend
eggleston
work
to
earnest
students
public
the
work
is
worthy
of
careful
reading
not
only
because
of
the
author
ability
as
a
literary
artist
but
because
of
his
conspicuous
proficiency
in
interpreting
the
causes
of
and
changes
in
american
life
and
character
it
is
noticeable
that
eggleston
has
followed
no
beaten
track
but
has
drawn
his
own
conclusions
as
to
the
early
period
and
they
differ
from
the
generally
received
version
not
a
little
the
book
is
stimulating

will
prove
of
great
value
to
the
student
of

the

the
value
