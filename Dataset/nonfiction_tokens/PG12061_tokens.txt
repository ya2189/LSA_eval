after
this
antoninus
secured
the
entire
power
nominally
he
ruled
with
his
brother
but
in
reality
alone
and
at
once
with
the
enemy
he
came
to
terms
withdrew
from
their
country
and
abandoned
the
forts
but
his
own
people
he
either
dismissed
as
papinianus
the
prefect
or
else
killed
as
euodus
his
nurse
castor
and
his
wife
plautilla
and
the
latter
brother
plautius
in
rome
itself
he
also
executed
a
man
who
was
renowned
for
no
other
reason
than
his
profession
which
made
him
very
conspicuous
this
was
euprepes
the
charioteer
he
killed
him
when
the
man
dared
to
show
enthusiasm
for
a
cause
that
the
emperor
opposed
so
euprepes
died
in
old
age
after
having
been
crowned
in
an
endless
number
of
he
had
won
seven
hundred
and
of
them
a
record
equaled
by
none
other
antoninus
had
first
had
the
desire
to
murder
his
brother
while
his
father
was
still
alive
but
had
been
unable
to
do
so
at
that
time
because
of
severus
or
later
on
the
road
because
of
the
legions
the
men
felt
very
kindly
toward
the
younger
son
especially
because
in
appearance
he
was
the
very
image
of
his
father
but
when
antoninus
arrived
in
rome
he
got
rid
of
this
rival
also
the
two
pretended
to
love
and
commend
each
other
but
their
actions
proved
quite
the
reverse
to
be
true
and
anybody
could
see
that
some
catastrophe
would
result
from
their
relations
this
fact
was
recognized
even
prior
to
their
reaching
rome
when
it
had
been
voted
by
the
senate
to
sacrifice
in
behalf
of
their
harmony
both
to
the
other
gods
and
to
harmony
herself
the
assistants
made
ready
a
victim
to
be
sacrificed
to
harmony
and
the
consul
arrived
to
do
the
slaughtering
yet
he
could
not
find
them
nor
could
the
assistants
find
the
consul
they
spent
nearly
the
whole
night
looking
for
each
other
so
that
the
sacrifice
could
not
be
performed
on
that
occasion
the
next
day
two
wolves
climbed
the
capitol
but
were
chased
away
from
that
region
one
of
them
was
next
encountered
somewhere
in
the
forum
and
the
other
was
later
slain
outside
the
pomerium
this
is
the
story
about
those
two
animals
sidenote
it
was
antoninus
wish
to
murder
his
brother
at
the
saturnalia
but
he
was
not
able
to
carry
out
his
intention
the
danger
had
already
grown
too
evident
to
be
concealed
as
a
consequence
there
were
many
violent
meetings
between
the
two
both
feeling
that
they
were
being
plotted
against
and
many
precautionary
measures
were
taken
on
both
sides
as
many
soldiers
and
athletes
abroad
and
at
home
day
and
night
were
guarding
geta
antoninus
persuaded
his
mother
to
send
for
him
and
his
brother
and
have
them
come
along
to
her
house
with
a
view
to
being
reconciled
geta
without
distrust
went
in
with
him
when
they
were
well
inside
some
centurions
suborned
by
antoninus
rushed
in
a
body
geta
on
seeing
them
had
run
to
his
mother
and
as
he
hung
upon
her
neck
and
clung
to
her
bosom
and
breasts
he
was
cut
down
bewailing
his
fate
and
crying
out
mother
that
bore
me
mother
that
bore
me
help
i
am
slain
sidenote
tricked
in
this
way
she
beheld
her
son
perishing
by
most
unholy
violence
in
her
very
lap
and
as
it
were
received
his
death
into
her
womb
whence
she
had
borne
him
she
was
all
covered
with
blood
so
that
she
made
no
account
of
the
wound
she
had
received
in
her
hand
she
might
neither
mourn
nor
weep
for
her
son
although
untimely
he
had
met
so
miserable
an
end
he
was
only
years
and
nine
months
old
on
the
contrary
she
was
compelled
to
rejoice
and
laugh
as
though
enjoying
some
great
piece
of
luck
all
her
words
gestures
and
changes
of
color
were
watched
with
the
utmost
narrowness
she
alone
augusta
wife
of
the
emperor
mother
of
emperors
was
not
permitted
to
shed
tears
even
in
private
over
so
great
a
calamity
sidenote
antoninus
although
it
was
evening
took
possession
of
the
legions
after
bawling
all
the
way
along
the
road
that
he
had
been
the
object
of
a
plot
and
was
in
danger
on
entering
the
fortifications
he
exclaimed
rejoice
for
now
i
have
a
chance
to
benefit
you
before
they
heard
the
whole
story
he
had
stopped
their
mouths
with
so
many
and
so
great
promises
that
they
could
neither
think
nor
speak
anything
decent
i
am
one
of
you
he
said
it
is
on
your
account
alone
that
i
care
to
live
that
so
i
may
afford
you
much
happiness
all
the
treasuries
are
yours
indeed
he
said
this
also
i
pray
if
possible
to
live
with
you
but
if
not
at
any
rate
to
die
with
you
i
do
not
fear
death
in
any
form
and
it
is
my
desire
to
end
my
days
in
warfare
there
should
a
man
die
or
nowhere
to
the
senate
on
the
following
day
he
made
various
remarks
and
after
rising
from
his
seat
he
went
towards
the
door
and
said
listen
to
a
great
announcement
from
me
that
the
whole
world
may
be
glad
let
all
the
exiles
who
have
been
condemned
on
any
complaint
whatever
in
any
way
whatever
be
restored
to
full
rights
thus
did
he
empty
the
islands
of
exiles
and
grant
pardon
to
the
worst
condemned
criminals
but
before
long
he
had
the
isles
full
again
sidenote
the
cæsarians
and
the
soldiers
that
had
been
with
geta
were
suddenly
put
to
death
to
the
number
of
twenty
thousand
men
and
women
alike
wherever
in
the
palace
any
of
them
happened
to
be
antoninus
slew
also
various
distinguished
men
among
them
papinianus
the
pretorians
accused
papianus
and
patruinus
footnote
this
is
valerius
patruinus
for
certain
actions
antoninus
allowed
the
complainants
to
kill
them
and
added
the
following
remark
i
hold
sway
for
your
advantage
and
not
for
my
own
therefore
i
defer
to
you
both
as
accusers
and
as
judges
he
rebuked
the
murderer
of
papinianus
for
using
an
axe
instead
of
a
sword
to
give
the
finishing
stroke
he
had
also
desired
to
deprive
of
life
cilo
his
nurse
and
benefactor
who
had
served
as
prefect
of
the
city
during
his
father
reign
whom
he
had
also
often
called
father
the
soldiers
sent
against
him
plundered
his
silver
plate
his
robes
his
money
and
everything
else
that
belonged
to
him
cilo
himself
they
conducted
along
the
sacred
way
making
the
palace
their
destination
where
they
prepared
to
give
him
his
quietus

had

slippers

open
and
disfigured
his
face
so
that
the
people
and

soldiers

in

antoninus
out

respect
and

for
them
met
the
party

soldiers
in

contingent
lost
their
lives
nominally
for
making
plots
but
really
for
not
having
killed
their
victim
sidenote
but
antoninus
was
so
anxious
to
appear
to
love
cilo
that
he
declared

who
have
plotted

him
have
plotted
against
me
commended
for
this
by
the
bystanders
he
proceeded
call
me
neither
hercules
nor
the
name
of
any
other
god
not
that
he
was
unwilling
to
be
termed
a
god
but
because
he
wished
to
do
nothing
worthy
of
a
god
he
was
naturally
capricious
in
all
matters
and
would
bestow
great
honors
upon
people
and
then
suddenly
disgrace
them
quite
without
reason
he
would
save
those
who
least
deserved
it
and
punish
those
whom

would
never
have
expected

with

and
after

had
walked

how
many
fasces
he
without

insulted
him
outrageously

called
his

not

of
the
distinguished
men
whom
he
killed
without

dio
because
the
slain
were
very
well
known
in
those
days
even
makes
a
list
of
them
for
me
it
suffices
to
say
that
he
crushed
the
life
out
of
everybody
he
chose
without
exception
whether
the
man
was
guilty
or
whether
he
was
not
footnote

homer
iliad
xv
verse
and
that
he
simply
mutilated
rome
by
rendering
it
bereft
of
excellent
men
antoninus
was
allied
to
three
races
and
he
possessed
not
a
single
one
of
their
good
points
but
included
in
himself
all
their
vices
the
lightness
the
cowardice
and
recklessness
of
gaul
were
his
the
roughness
and
cruelty
of
africa
the
abominations
of
syria
whence
he
was
on
his
side
veering
from
slaughter
to
sports
he
pursued
his
murderous
course
no
less
in
the
latter
of
course
one
would
pay
no
attention
to
an
elephant
rhinoceros
tiger
and
hippotigris
being
killed
in
the
theatre
but
he
took
equal
pleasure
in
having
gladiators
shed
the
greatest
amount
of
one
another
blood
one
of
them
bato
he
forced
to
fight
three
successive
men
on
the
same
day
and
then
when
bato
met
death
at
the
hands
of
the
last
he
honored
him
with
a
conspicuous
burial
sidenote
he
had
alexander
on
the
brain
to
such
an
extent
that
he
used
certain
weapons
and
cups
which
purported
to
have
belonged
to
the
great
conqueror
and
furthermore
he
set
up
many
representations
of
him
both
among
the
legions
and
in
rome
itself
he
organized
a
phalanx
sixteen
thousand
men
of
macedonians
alone
named
it
phalanx
and
equipped
it
with
the
arms
which
warriors
had
used
in
his
day
these
were
a
helmet
of
raw
oxhide
a
linen
breastplate
a
bronze
shield
long
pike
short
spear
high
boots
sword
not
even
this
however
satisfied
him
but
he
called
his
hero
the
eastern
augustus
once
he
wrote
to
the
senate
that
alexander
had
come
on
earth
again
in
the
body
of
the
augustus
footnote
antoninus
meant
himself
so
that
when
he
had
finished
his
own
brief
existence
he
might
enjoy
a
larger
life
in
the
emperor
person
the
aristotelian
philosophers
he
hated
bitterly
wishing
even
to
burn
their
books
and
he
abolished
the
common
messes
they
had
in
alexandria
and
all
the
other
privileges
they
enjoyed
his
grievance
as
stated
was
the
tradition
that
aristotle
had
been
an
accomplice
in
the
death
of
alexander
this
was
the
way
he
behaved
in
those
matters
and
by
jupiter
he
took
around
with
him
numbers
of
elephants
that
in
this
respect
too
he
might
seem
to
be
imitating
alexander
or
rather
perhaps
dionysus
sidenote
on
alexander
account
he
was
fond
of
all
the
macedonians
once
after
praising
a
macedonian
tribune
because
the
latter
had
shown
agility
in
jumping
upon
his
horse
he
enquired
of
him
first
from
what
country
are
you
then
learning
that
he
was
a
macedonian
he
pursued
what
is
your
name
having
thereupon
heard
that
it
was
antigonus
he
further
questioned
how
was
your
father
called
when
the
father
name
was
found
to
be
philip
he
declared
i
have
all
my
desire
he
straightway
bestowed
upon
him
the
whole
series
of
exalted
military
honors
and
before
a
great
while
appointed
him
one
of
the
senators
with
the
rank
of
an
there
was
another
man
who
had
no
connection
with
macedonia
but
had
committed
many
dreadful
crimes
and
for
this
reason
was
tried
before
him
in
an
appealed
case
his
name
proved
to
be
alexander
and
when
the
orator
accusing
him
said
repeatedly
the
bloodthirsty
alexander
the
alexander
the
emperor
became
angry
as
if
he
were
personally
slandered
and
spoke
out
if
alexander
does
suit
you
you
may
regard
yourself
as
dismissed
sidenote
now
this
great
alexandrophile
antoninus
kept
many
men
about
him
alleging
reasons
after
reasons
all
fictitious
and
wars
upon
wars
he
had
also
this
most
frightful
characteristic
that
he
was
fond
of
spending
money
not
only
upon
the
soldiers
but
for
all
other
projects
with
one
sole
end
in
view
to
strip
despoil
and
grind
down
all
mankind
and
the
senators
by
no
means
least
in
the
first
place
there
were
gold
crowns
that
he
kept
demanding
on
the
constant
pretext
that
he
had
conquered
some
enemy
or
other
i
am
not
speaking
about
the
actual
manufacture
of
the
crowns
for
what
does
that
amount
to
but
the
great
sums
of
money
constantly
being
given
under
that
name
by
the
cities
for
the
crowning
as
it
is
called
of
their
emperors
then
there
was
the
provisions
which
we
were
all
the
time
levying
in
great
abundance
from
all
quarters
sometimes
seizing
them
without
compensation
and
sometimes
spending
a
little
something
on
them
all
this
supply
he
presented
or
else
peddled
to
the
soldiers
and
the
gifts
which
he
demanded
from
wealthy
individuals
and
from
states
and
the
taxes
both
the
new
ones
which
he
published
and
the
ten
per
cent
tax
that
he
instituted
in
place
of
the
twenty
per
cent
to
apply
to
the
emancipation
of
slaves
to
bequests
left
to
any
one
and
to
all
gifts
for
he
abolished
in
such
cases
the
right
of
succession
and
exemption
from
taxes
which
had
been
accorded
to
those
closely
related
to
persons
deceased
this
accounts
for
his
giving
the
title
of
romans
to
all
the
men
in
his
empire
nominally
it
was
to
honor
them
but
his
real
purpose
was
to
get
an
increased
income
by
such
means
since
foreigners
did
not
have
to
pay
most
of
those
taxes
but
aside
from
all
these
we
were
also
compelled
to
build
at
our
own
expense
all
sorts
of
dwellings
for
him
whenever
he
took
a
trip
from
rome
and
costly
lodgings
in
the
middle
of
even
the
very
shortest
journeys
yet
not
only
did
he
never
live
in
them
but
he
had
no
idea
of
so
much
as
looking
at
a
single
one
moreover
without
receiving
any
appropriation
from
him
we
constructed
and
at
every
point
where
he
wintered
or
expected
to
winter
they
were
all
torn
down
without
delay
and
apparently
the
sole
purpose
of
their
being
called
into
existence
was
to
impoverish
us
sidenote
the
emperor
himself
kept
spending
the
money
upon
the
soldiers
as
we
said
and
upon
beasts
and
horses
he
was
forever
killing
great
collections
of
wild
beasts
of
horses
and
also
of
domestic
animals
forcing
us
to
contribute
the
majority
of
them
though
now
and
then
he
bought
a
few
one
day
he
slew
a
hundred
boars
at
once
with
his
own
hands
he
raced
also
in
chariots
and
then
he
would
wear
the
blue
costume
in
all
undertakings
he
was
exceedingly
and
exceedingly
fickle
and
besides
this
he
possessed
the
rascality
of
his
mother
and
of
the
syrians
to
which
race
she
belonged
he
would
put
up
some
kind
of
freedman
or
other
wealthy
person
as
director
of
games
merely
that
in
this
occupation
too
the
man
might
spend
money
from
below
he
would
make
gestures
of
subservience
to
the
audience
with
his
whip
and
would
beg
for
gold
pieces
like
one
of
the
lowliest
citizens
he
said
that
he
used
the
same
methods
of
as
the
sun
god
and
he
took
pride
in
the
fact
accordingly
during
the
whole
extent
of
his
reign
the
whole
earth
so
far
as
it
yielded
obedience
to
him
was
plundered
hence
the
romans
once
at
a
uttered
this
among
other
cries
we
are
destroying
the
living
in
order
to
bury
the
dead
the
emperor
would
often
say
no
man
need
have
money
but
me
and
i
want
it
to
bestow
it
on
the
soldiers
once
when
julia
chided
him
for
his
great
outlays
upon
them
and
said
no
longer
is
any
resource
either
just
or
unjust
left
to
us
he
replied
exhibiting
his
sword
cheer
up
mother
for
as
long
as
we
have
this
money
is
not
going
to
fail
us
sidenote
to
those
who
flattered
him
however
he
distributed
possessions
and
money
paulus
footnote
undoubtedly
a
mistake
for
the
subsequently
mentioned
was
a
man
of
consular
rank
who
was
a
great
chatterer
and
joker
and
would
not
refrain
from
aiming
his
shafts
of
wit
at
the
very
emperors
therefore
severus
had
him
taken
into
custody
though
without
constraints
when
he
still
continued
even
under
guard
to
make
the
sovereigns
the
objects
of
his
jests
severus
sent
for
him
and
swore
that
he
would
cut
off
his
head
but
the
man
replied
yes
you
can
cut
it
off
but
as
long
as
i
have
it
neither
you
nor
i
can
restrain
it
and
so
severus
laughed
and
released
him
he
granted
to
julius
paulinus
myriads
because
the
man
who
was
a
jester
had
been
led
though
involuntarily
to
make
a
joke
upon
him
paulinus
had
said
that
he
actually
resembled
a
man
getting
angry
for
somehow
he
was
always
assuming
a
fierce
expression
footnote
none
of
the
editors
any
more
than
the
casual
reader
has
been
able
to
find
anything
of
a
sidesplitting
nature
in
this
joke
the
trouble
is
of
course
that
the
utterance
sounds
like
a
plain
statement
of
fact
caracalla
natural
disposition
was
harsh
and
irritable
some
have
changed
the
word
man
to
pan
in
anger
but
without
gaining
very
much
i
offer
for
what
it
is
worth
the
suggestion
that
a
truth
especially
in
the
case
of
personal
characteristics
may
sound
very
amusing
when
pronounced
in
a
quizzical
or
fashion
by
a
person
possessing
sufficient
thus
we
may
conceive
paulinus
a
professional
jester
on
meeting
antoninus
to
have
blurted
out
in
a
tone
of
mock
surprise
why
anybody
would
really
think
you
are
angry
you
look
so
cross
all
the
time
there
would
then
be
a
point
in
the
jest
but
the
point
would
lie
not
in
the
words
but
in
the
voice
and
features
of
the
speaker
apart
from
this
explanation
of
the
possible
humor
of
the
remark
an
excerpt
of
peter
patricius
exc
vat
gives
us
to
understand
that
it
would
be
taken
as
a
compliment
by
antoninus
from
the
mouth
of
a
person
to
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
accord
some
liberties
since
antoninus
made
a
point
of
maintaining
at
all
times
this
character
of
harshness
and
abruptness
antoninus
made
no
account
of
anything
excellent
he
never
learned
anything
of
the
kind
as
he
himself
admitted
so
it
was
that
he
showed
a
contempt
for
us
who
possessed
something
approaching
education
severus
to
be
sure
had
trained
him
in
all
pursuits
bar
none
that
tended
to
inculcate
virtue
whether
physical
or
mental
so
that
even
after
he
became
emperor
he
went
to
teachers
and
studied
philosophy
most
of
the
day
he
also
took
oil
rubbings
without
water
and
rode
horseback
to
a
distance
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
stades
moreover
he
practiced
swimming
even
in
rough
water
in
consequence
of
this
antoninus
was
as
you
might
say
strong
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
culture
since
he
had
never
even
heard
the
name
of
it
still
his
language
was
not
bad
nor
did
he
lack
judgment
but
he
showed
in
almost
everything
a
keen
appreciation
and
talked
very
readily
for
through
his
authority
and
recklessness
and
his
habit
of
saying
right
out
without
reflection
anything
at
all
that
occurred
to
him
and
not
being
ashamed
to
air
his
thoughts
he
often
stumbled
upon
some
felicitous
expression
but
the
same
antoninus
made
many
mistakes
through
his
headstrong
opinions
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
know
everything
he
wanted
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
anything
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
have
all
power
he
would
be
the
only
one
with
any
power
hence
it
was
that
he
employed
no
counselor
and
was
jealous
of
such
men
as
knew
something
worth
while
he
never
loved
a
single
person
and
he
hated
all
those
who
excelled
in
anything
and
most
did
he
hate
those
whom
he
affected
most
to
love
many
of
these
he
destroyed
in
some
way
or
other
of
course
he
had
many
men
murdered
openly
but
others
he
would
send
to
provinces
not
suited
to
them
fatal
to
their
physical
condition
having
an
unwholesome
climate
thus
while
pretending
to
honor
them
excessively
he
quietly
got
rid
of
them
exposing
such
as
he
did
not
like
to
excessive
heat
or
cold
hence
though
he
spared
some
in
so
far
as
not
to
put
them
to
death
yet
he
subjected
them
to
such
hardships
that

on
him

him
in

terms

sidenote
now
we
shall
state
what
sort
of
person
he
showed
himself
in
war
abgarus
king
of
the
osrhoeni
when
he
had
once
got
control
of
the
kindred
tribes
inflicted
the
most
outrageous
treatment
upon
his
superiors
nominally
he
was
compelling
them
to
change
to
roman
customs
but
in
fact
he
was
making
the
most
of
his
authority
over
them
in
an
unjustifiable
way
he
tricked
the
king
of
the
osrhoeni
abgarus
inducing
him
to
visit
him
as
a
friend
and
then
arrested
and
imprisoned
him
this
left
osrhoene
without
a
ruler
and
he
subdued
it
the
king
of
the
armenians
had
a
dispute
with
his
own
children
and
antoninus
summoned
him
in
a
friendly
letter
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
making
peace
between
them
he
treated
these
princes
in
the
same
fashion
as
he
had
abgarus
the
armenians
however
instead
of
yielding
to
him
had
recourse
to
arms
and
not
one
of
them
thereafter
would
trust
him
in
the
slightest
particular
thus
he
was
brought
by
experience
to
understand
how
great
the
penalty
is
for
an
emperor
practicing
deceit
toward
friends
the
same
ruler
assumed
the
utmost
credit
for
the
fact
that
at
the
death
of
vologæsus
king
of
the
parthians
his
children
proceeded
to
fight
about
the
sovereignty
what
was
purely
accidental
he
pretended
had
come
about
through
his
own
connivance
he
ever
took
vehement
delight
in
the
actions
and
dissensions
of
the
brothers
and
generally
in
the
mutual
slaughter
of
foreign
potentates
he
did
not
hesitate
either
to
write
to
the
senate
regarding
the
rulers
of
the
parthians
who
were
brothers
and
at
variance
that
the
brothers
quarrel
would
work
great
harm
to
the
parthian
state
just
as
if
barbarian
governments
could
be
destroyed
by
such
procedure
and
yet
the
roman
state
had
been
preserved
just
as
if
it
had
not
been
on
the
contrary
almost
utterly
overthrown
it
was
not
merely
that
the
great
sums
of
blood
money
given
under
such
conditions
to
the
soldiers
for
his
brother
murder
served
to
demoralize
mankind
in
addition
vast
numbers
of
citizens
had
information
laid
against
them
not
only
those
who
had
sent
the
brother
letters
or
had
brought
him
presents

up

displayed

not
even
this
sufficed
him

more
than
ever
from
this
time
he
began
his

he
held
court

little
or
not
at
all
most
of
his
leisure
he
devoted
to
meddlesomeness
as
much
as
anything
people
from
all
quarters
brought
him
word
of
all
the
most
insignificant
occurrences
for
this
reason
he
gave
orders
that
the
soldiers
who
kept
their
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
for
these
details
should
be
liable
to
punishment
by
no
one
save
himself
this
enactment
too
produced
no
good
result
but
we
had
a
new
set
of
tyrants
in
them
but
the
thing
that
was
especially
unseemly
and
most
unworthy
both
of
the
senate
and
of
the
roman
people
we
had
a
eunuch
to
domineer
over
us
he
was
a
native
of
spain
by
name
sempronius
rufus
and
his
occupation
that
of
a
sorcerer
and
juggler
for
which
he
had
been
confined
on
an
island
by
severus
this
fellow
was
destined
to
pay
the
penalty
for
his
conduct
as
were
also
the
rest
who
laid
information
against
others
as
for
antoninus
he
would
send
word
that
he
should
hold
court
or
transact
any
other
public
business
directly
after
dawn
but
he
kept
putting
us
off
till
noon
and
often
till
evening
and
would
not
even
admit
us
to
the
so
that
we
had
to
stand
about
outside
somewhere
usually
at
a
late
hour
he
decided
that
he
would
not
even
exchange
greetings
with
us
that
day
meanwhile
he
was
largely
engaged
in
gratifying
his
inquisitiveness
as
i
said
or
was
driving
chariots

beasts
fighting
as

the
consequent
big

macedonian
phalanx
he
constructed
two
very
large
engines
for
the
armenian
and
for
the
parthian
war
so
that
he
could
take
them
to
pieces
and
carry
them
over
on
boats
into
syria
for
the
rest
he
was
staining
himself
with
more
blood
and
transgressing
laws
and
using
up
money
neither
in
these
matters
nor
in
any
others
did
he
heed
his
mother
who
gave
him
much
excellent
advice
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
entrusted
to
her
the
management
of
the
books
and
letters
both
save
the
very
important
ones
and
that
he
inscribed
her
name
with
many
praises
in
his
letters
to
the
senate
mentioning
it
in
the
same
connection
as
his
own
and
that
of
his
armies

a
statement
that
she
was

it
be
mentioned

she
greeted
publicly
all
the
foremost
men
just
as
her
son
did
but
she
continued
more
and
more
her
study
of
philosophy
with
these
persons
he
kept
declaring
that
he
needed
nothing
beyond
necessities
and
gave
himself
airs
over
the
fact
that
he
could
get
along
with
the
cheapest
kind
of
living
yet
there
was
nothing
on
earth
or
in
the
sea
or
in
the
air
that
we
did
not
keep
furnishing
him
privately
and
publicly
of
these
articles
he
used
extremely
few
for
the
benefit
of
the
friends
with
him
for
he
no
longer
cared
to
dine
with
us
but
the
most
of
them
he
consumed
with
his
freedmen
such
was
his
delight
in
magicians
and
jugglers

he
commended
and
honored

the
pretext
for
his
campaign
against
the
parthians
was
that
vologæsus
had
not
acceded
to
his
request
for
the
extradition
of
tiridates
and
a
certain
antiochus
with
him
antiochus
was
a
cilician
and
pretended
at
first
to
be
a
philosopher
of
the
cynic
school
in
this
way
he
was
of
very
great
assistance
to
the
soldiers
in
warfare
he
strengthened
them
against
the
despair
caused
by
the
excessive
cold
for
he
threw
himself
into
the
snow
and
rolled
in
it
and
as
a
result
he
obtained
money
and
honors
from
severus
himself
and
from
antoninus
elated
at
this
he
attached
himself
to
tiridates
and
in
his
company
deserted
to
the
parthian
prince
sidenote
antoninus
surely
maligned
himself
in
asserting
that
he
had
overcome
by
slyness
the
audacity
rapacity
and
faithlessness
of
the
celtæ
against
which
arms
were
of
no
avail
the
same
man
commended
fabricius
luscinus
because
he
had
refused
to
let
pyrrhus
be
treacherously
murdered

took
pride

put

the
vandili

were
friends

in
having
executed

the
accused
king

since
one
of
the
latter
associates
under
accusation
at
the
same
time
with
him
hanged
himself
before
execution
antoninus
delivered
his
corpse
to
the
barbarians
to
be
wounded
that
the
man
might
be
regarded
as
having
been
killed
in
pursuance
of
a
sentence
instead
of
dying
voluntarily
which
was
deemed
a
creditable
act
among
them
he
killed
cæcilius
æmilianus
governor
of
bætica
on
suspicion
that
he
had
asked
an
oracular
reply
from
hercules
at
gades
sidenote
before
leaving
nicomedea
the
emperor
held
a
gladiatorial
contest
there
in
honor
of
his
birthday
for
not
even
on
that
day
did
he
refrain
from
slaughter
here
it
is
said
that
a
combatant
being
defeated
begged
for
his
life
whereupon
antoninus
said
go
and
ask
your
adversary
i
am
not
empowered
to
spare
you
sidenote
and
so
the
wretch
who
would
probably
have
been
allowed
by
his
antagonist
to
go
if
the
above
words
had
not
been
spoken
lost
his
life
the
victor
did
not
dare
release
him
for
fear
of
appearing
more
humane
than
the
emperor
sidenote
for
all
that
while
so
engaged
and
steeped
in
the
luxury
of
antioch
even
to
the
point
of
keeping
his
chin
wholly
bare
he
gave
utterance
to
laments
as
if
he
were
in
the
midst
of
great
toils
and
dangers
and
he
reproved
the
senate
saying
for
one
thing
that
they
were
slothful
did
not
understand
readily
and
did
not
give
their
votes
separately
finally
he
wrote
i
know
that
my
behavior
does
please
you
but
the
reason
for
my
having
arms
and
soldiers
alike
is
to
enable
me
to
disregard
anything
that
is
said
about
me
sidenote
when
the
parthian
monarch
in
fear
surrendered
both
tiridates
and
antiochus
he
disbanded
the
expedition
at
once
but
he
despatched
theocritus
with
an
army
into
armenian
territory
and
suffered
defeat
amounting
to
a
severe
reverse
at
the
hands
of
the
inhabitants
theocritus
was
of
servile
origin
and
had
been
brought
up
in
the
orchestra
he
was
the
man
who
had
taught
antoninus
dancing
and
had
been
a
favorite
of
saoterus
and
through
the
influence
thus
acquired
he
had
been
introduced
to
the
theatre
at
rome
but
as
he
was
disliked
there
he
was
driven
out
of
rome
and
went
to
lugdunum
where
he
delighted
the
people
who
were
rather
provincial
and
from
a
slave
and
dancer
he
came
to
be
an
army
leader
and
prefect
he
advanced
to
such
power
in
the
household
of
antoninus
that
both
the
prefects
were
as
nothing
compared
to
him
likewise
epagathus
himself
also
a
cæsarian
had
equal
influence
with
him
and
committed
equal
transgressions
thus
theocritus
who
kept
traveling
back
and
forth
in
the
interest
of
securing
provisions
and
selling
them
at
retail
proved
the
death
of
many
persons
because
of
his
authority
and
for
other
reasons
one
victim
was
titianus
flavius
the
latter
while
procurator
in
alexandria
offended
him
in
some
way
whereupon
theocritus
leaping
from
his
seat
drew
his
sword
at
that
titianus
remarked
this
too
you
have
done
like
a
dancer
hence
the
other
in
a
rage
ordered
him
to
be
killed
sidenote
now
antoninus
in
spite
of
his
declaration
that
he
cherished
an
overwhelming
love
for
alexander
all
but
destroyed
utterly
the
whole
population
of
alexander
city
hearing
that
he
was
spoken
against
and
ridiculed
by
them
for
various
reasons
and
not
least
of
all
for
murdering
his
brother
he
set
out
for
alexandria
concealing
his
wrath
and
pretending
to
long
to
see
them
but
when
he
reached
the
suburbs
whither
the
leading
citizens
had
come
with
certain
mystic
and
sacred
symbols
he
greeted
them
as
if
he
intended
to
entertain
them
at
a
banquet
and
then
put
them
to
death
after
this
he
arrayed
his
whole
force
in
armor
and
marched
into
the
city
he
had
sent
previous
notice
to
all
the
people
there
to
remain
at
home
and
had
occupied
all
the
streets
and
in
addition
all
the
roofs
in
advance
and
to
pass
over
the
details
of
the
calamities
that
then
befell
the
wretched
city
he
slaughtered
so
many
individuals
that
he
dared
not
even
speak
about
the
number
of
them
but
wrote
the
senate
that
it
was
of
no
interest
how
many
of
them
or
who
had
died
for
they
all
deserved
to
suffer
this
fate
of
the
property
part
was
plundered
and
part
destroyed
sidenote
with
the
people
perished
also
many
foreigners
and
not
a
few
who
had
accompanied
antoninus
were
destroyed
for
want
of
identification
as
the
city
was
large
and
persons
were
being
murdered
all
over
it
by
night
and
by
day
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
anybody
no
matter
how
much
one
might
wish
it
they
simply
expired
as
chance
directed
and
their
bodies
were
straightway
cast
into
deep
trenches
to
keep
the
rest
from
being
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
that
was
the
fate
of
the
natives
the
foreigners
were
all
driven
out
except
the
merchants
and
even
they
had
all
their
wares
plundered
also
some
shrines
were
despoiled
in
the
midst
of
most
of
these
atrocities
antoninus
was
present
and
looked
on
and
personally
took
a
hand
but
sometimes
he
issued
orders
to
others
from
the
temple
of
serapis
he
lived
in
this
god
precinct
even
during
the
nights
and
days
that
witnessed
the
shedding
of
egyptian
blood
and
he
sent
word
to
the
senate
that
he
was
observing
purity
during
the
days
when
he
was
in
reality
sacrificing
there
domestic
beasts
and
human
beings
at
the
same
time
to
the
god
yet
why
should
i
have

the
next
thing
was
a
campaign
against
the
parthians
and
the
pretext
that
was
used
was
that
artabanus
had
refused
to
view
favorably
his
wooing
and
give
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
but
he
knew
well
enough
that
while
pretending
to
want
to
marry
her
he
in

was
anxious
to
detach

not

quarters

therefore
i
have
had
nothing
of
especial
interest
to
record
concerning
the
doings
of
that
expedition
except
perhaps
one
anecdote
two
soldiers
who
had
seized
a
skin
of
wine
came
to
him
each
claiming
the
booty
as
entirely
his
own
being
bidden
by
him
to
divide
the
wine
equally
they
drew
their
swords
and
cut
the
wine
skin
in
two
apparently
expecting
each
to
get
a
half
with
the
wine
in
it
they
so
dreaded
their
emperor
that
they
troubled
him
even
with
such
details
and
showed
such
scrupulousness
as
to
lose
both
wineskin
and
wine
now
the
barbarians
took
refuge
in
the
mountains
and
across
the
tigris
in
order
to
perfect
their
preparations
but
antoninus
suppressed
this
fact
and
assuming
that
he
had
utterly
vanquished
a
foe
whom
he
had
not
even
seen
he
displayed
becoming
pride
and
as
he
himself
wrote

was
particularly
gratified
because
a
lion
ran
down
from
the

on
his
side

fated

he
had
also
made
a
name
which
owed
its
origin
to
this
fact
accordingly
he
suborned
two
tribunes
stationed
in
the
pretorian

nemesianus
and
apollinarius
brothers
belonging
to
the
aurelian
gens
and
julius

had
a
private
grudge
against
antoninus
for
not
giving
him
the
post
of
centurion
on
request
thus
he
made
his
plot
and
it
was
carried
out
as
follows
on
the
eighth
of

when
the

had
set
out
from

had
dismounted
from

assassin
at

fled

would
have
escaped
detection

he
thrown
away

sword

weapon
led
to
his
being
recognized
by

of

scythians
on

him
not
merely
to
be
an
ally
of
his
but
as
keeping
guard
over
him
to
a
certain
extent

for
he
maintained
scythians

celtæ
about
him
free
and
slaves
alike
whom
he
had
taken
away
from
children
and
wives
and
had
equipped
with
arms

he
affected
to
place
more
dependence
upon
them
than
upon
the
soldiers
to
illustrate
he
kept
honoring
them
with
posts
as
centurions
and
he
called
them
lions
moreover
he
would
often
converse
with
emissaries
sent
from
the
very
provinces
and
in
the
presence
of
no
one
else
but
the
interpreters
would
urge
them
in
case
any
catastrophe
befell
him
to
invade
italy
and
march
upon
rome
assuring
them
that
it
was
very
easy
to
capture
and
to
prevent
any
inkling
of
his
talk
spreading
to
our
ears
he
would
immediately
put
to
death
the
interpreters
for
all
that
we
did
ascertain
it
later
from
the
barbarians
themselves
and
the
matter
of
the
poisons
we
learned
from
macrinus
it
seemed
that
he
partly
sent
for
and
partly
bought
quantities
of
all
kinds
of
poisons
from
the
inhabitants
of
upper
asia
spending
altogether
seven
hundred
and
fifty
myriads
upon
them
in
order
that
he
might
secretly
kill
in
different
ways
great
numbers
of
men
in
fine
whomsoever
he
would
they
were
subsequently
discovered
in
the
royal
apartments
and
were
all
consumed
by
fire
at
this
time
the
soldiers
both
for
this
reason
and
beyond
other
considerations
because
they
were
vexed
at
having
the
barbarians
preferred
to
themselves
were
not
altogether
so
enthusiastic
over
their
leader
as
of
yore
and
did
not
aid
him
when
he
became
the
victim
of
a
plot
such
was
the
end
that
he
met
after
a
life
of
years
and
four
days
for
he
had
been
born
on
the
fourth
of
april
and
after
a
reign
of
six
years
two
months
and
two
days
sidenote
there
are
many
things
at
this
point
too
in
the
story
that
occur
to
excite
my
surprise
when
he
was
about
to
start
from
antioch
on
his
last
journey
his
father
confronted
him
in
a
vision
girt
with
a
sword
and
saying
as
you
killed
your
brother
so
will
i
smite
you
unto
death
and
the
soothsayers
told
him
to
beware
of
that
day
using
so
direct
a
form
of
speech
as
this
the
gates
of
the
liver
are
shut
after
this
he
went
out
through
some
door
paying
no
heed
to
the
fact
that
the
lion
which
he
was
wont
to
call
rapier
and
had
for
a
table
companion
and
bedfellow
knocked
him
down
as
he
went
out
and
moreover
tore
some
of
his
clothing
he
kept
many
other
lions
besides
and
always
had
some
of
them
around
him
but
this
one
he
would
often
caress
even
publicly
it
was
thus
that
these
events
occurred
and
a
little
before
his
death
as
i
have
heard
a
great
fire
suddenly
fastened
upon
the
entire
interior
of
the
temple
of
serapis
in
alexandria
and
did
no
other
harm
whatever
save
only
to
destroy
that
sword
with
which
he
had
slain
his
brother
later
when
it
stopped
many
stars
shone
out
in
rome
too
a
spirit
wearing
the
likeness
of
a
man
led
an
ass
up
the
capitol
and
later
up
the
palatine
seeking
as
he
said
its
master
and
stating
that
antoninus
was
dead
and
jupiter
reigned
arrested
for
his
behavior
he
was
sent
by
maternianus
to
antoninus
and
he
declared
i
depart
as
you
bid
but
i
shall
face
not
this
emperor
but
another
afterwards
on
coming
to
capua
he
vanished
sidenote
this
took
place
while
the
prince
was
still
alive
at
the
held
in
memory
of
severus
reign
the
statue
of
mars
while
being
carried
in
procession
fell
down
this
perhaps
would
not
arouse
such
great
wonder
but
listen
to
the
greatest
marvel
of
all
the
green
faction
had
been
defeated
whereupon
catching
sight
of
a
jackdaw
which
was
screeching
very
loud
on
the
tip
of
a
javelin
they
all
gazed
at
him
and
all
of
a
sudden
as
if
by
previous
arrangement
cried
out
hail
martialius
martialius
hail
long
it
is
since
we
beheld
thee
it
was
not
that
the
jackdaw
was
ever
so
called
but
through
him
they
were
greeting
apparently
under
some
divine
inspiration
martialius
the
assassin
of
antoninus
to
some
indeed
antoninus
seemed
to
have
foretold
his
own
end
inasmuch
as
in
the
last
letter
that
he
sent
to
the
senate
he
had
said
cease
praying
that
i
may
reign
a
hundred
years
the
petition
mentioned
had
always
been
uttered
from
the
beginning
of
his
sovereignty
and
this
was
the
first
and
only
time
that
he
found
fault
with
it
thus
while
his
words
were
simply
meant
to
chide
them
for
offering
a
prayer
impossible
of
accomplishment
he
was
really
indicating
that
he
should
no
longer
rule
for
any
length
of
time
and
when
certain
persons
had
once
called
attention
to
this
fact
it
also
came
to
my
mind
that
when
he
was
giving
us
a
banquet
in
nicomedea
at
the
saturnalia
and
had
talked
a
good
deal
as
was
usual
at
a
symposium
then

nonsense
but
when
not
long
after
he
perished
the
fact
that
this
was
the
last
speech
he
uttered

me
was
thought
to
infuse
into
it
a

accordingly
the

was
then
burned

his
bones
brought
secretly
by

into
rome
were
deposited
in
the
mausoleum
of
the
antonines
all
the
senators
and
private
individuals
men
and
women
without

entertained
so
violent
a

of
him
that
all
their
words
and
actions
relating
to
him
were
such
as
would
befit
the
downfall
of
a
most
implacable
foe
he
was
not
officially
disgraced
because
the
soldiers
did
not
get
from
macrinus
the
state
of
peace
which
they
had
hoped
to
secure
by
a
change
deprived
of
the
profits
which
they
were
wont
to
receive
from
antoninus
they
began
to
long
for
him
again
indeed
their
wishes
subsequently
prevailed
to
the
extent
of
having
him
enrolled
among
the
heroes
of
course
this
was
voted
by
the
senate

no

some
called

was
in

very
small

very

in
spirit
very
audacious
and
very
bloodthirsty
sidenote
now
his
affairs
however
one
may
name
him
were
in
this
state
as
for
me
even
before
he
came
to
the
throne
it
was
foretold
me
in
a
way
by
his
father
that
i
should
write
this
account
just
after
his
death
methought
i
saw
in
a
great
plain
the
whole
power
of
rome
arrayed
in
arms
and
it
seemed
as
if
severus
were
sitting
on
a
knoll
there
and
on
a
lofty
tribunal
conversing
with
them
and
seeing
me
standing
by
to
hear
what
was
said

spoke

that
you
may
both
ascertain

that
is
said

done
such
was
the
life
and
the
overthrow
of

him
there
perished
also

who
had
shared
in
the
plot
against
him
some
at
once
and
others
before
a
great
while
his
intimate
companions
and
the
cæsarians
likewise
perished
he
had
been
as
it
were
coupled
with
a
spirit
of
murder
that
operated
equally
against
enemies
and
against
friends
sidenote
macrinus
by
race
a
moor
from
cæsarea
came
from
most
obscure
parents
so
that
with
considerable
justice
he
was
likened
to
the
ass
that
was
led
to
the
palatine
by
the
apparition
for
one
thing
his
left
ear
had
been
bored
according
to
the
custom
generally
in
vogue
among
the
moors
his
affability
was
even
more
striking
as
to
duties
his
comprehension
of
them
was
not
so
accurate
as
his
performance
of
them
was
faithful
thus
it
was
thanks
to
the
advocacy
of
a
friend
cause
that
he
became
known
to
plautianus
and
at
first
he
took
the
position
of
manager
of
the
latter
property
subsequently
he
ran
a
risk
of
perishing
together
with
his
employer
but
was
unexpectedly
saved
by
the
intercession
of
cilo
and
was
given
charge
of
the
vehicles
of
severus
that
passed
back
and
forth
along
the
flaminian
way
from
antoninus
after
securing
some
titles
of
a
procuratorship
he
obtained
an
appointment
as
prefect
and
administered
the
affairs
of
this
responsible
position
excellently
and
with
entire
justice
so
far
as
he
was
free
to
act
independently
this
then
was
his
general
character
and
these
the
steps
of
his
advancement
even
during
the
life
of
tarautas
he
was
led
in
the
way
that
i
have
described
to
harbor
in
his
mind
the
hope
of
empire
and
at
his
death
he
did
not
to
be
sure
either
that
day
or
the
two
following
days
occupy
the
office
in
order
to
avoid
the
imputation
of
having
killed
him
with
such
intentions
but
for
that
space
of
time
the
roman
state
remained
completely
bereft
of
a
ruler
possessing
authority
though
without
the
people
knowing
it
he
communicated
with
the
soldiers
in
every
direction
that
is
to
say
the
ones
who
were
in
mesopotamia
on
account
of
the
war
but
instead
of
being
in
one
body
were
scattered
all
about
and
he
won
their
allegiance
through
the
agency
of
his
footnote
reading
greek
ohi
dindorf
instead
of
greek
hos
friends
among
his
various
offers
being
a
suggestion
that
they
might
secure
a
respite
from
the
war
which
was
an
especial
cause
of
dissatisfaction
to
them
and
so
on
the
fourth
day
the
anniversary
of
severus
birthday
he
was
chosen
emperor
by
them
after
making
a
show
of
resistance
sidenote
he
delivered
an
address
full
of
good
points
and
held
out
hopes
of
many
advantages
to
the
rest
of
mankind
as
well
those
who
had
been
doomed
to
some

act

impiety

kind

is
so
named
with
reference
to
attitude
toward
emperors
were
absolved
from
their
sentence
and
complaints
of
that
nature
which
were
pending
were
dismissed
he
rescinded
the
measures
enacted
by
caracalla
relating
to
inheritances
and
emancipations
and
by
asseverating
that
it
was
a
sacrilege
to
kill
a
senator
he
succeeded
in
his
appeal
for
the
pardon
of
aurelianus
whose
surrender
was
demanded
by
the
soldiers
because
he
had
proved
most
obnoxious
to
them
in
many
previous

though
in
truth
he
was
praised
by
some
for
this
and
not
without
reason
still
he
incurred
on
the
part
of
the
sensible
a
censure
that
quite
counterbalanced
it
the
adverse
sentiment
in
question
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
enrolled
certain
persons
in
the
ranks
of
and
immediately
assigned
them
to
governorships
of
provinces
yet
he
refused
the
following
year
to
have
the
reputation
of
being
consul
twice
because
he
had
the
honors
of
this
was
a
practice
begun
during
the
reign
of
severus
and
followed
also
by
the
latter
son
this
procedure
however
both
in
his
own
case
and
in
that
of
adventus
was
lawful
enough
but
he
showed
great
folly
in
sending
marcius
agrippa
first
into
pannonia
and
later
into
dacia
to
govern
the
previous
officials
of
the
districts
mentioned
sabinus
and
castinus
he
summoned
at
once
to
his
side
pretending
that
he
wanted
their
company
but
really
because
he
feared
their
surpassing
spirit
and
their
friendship
for
caracalla
it
was
in
this
way
that
he
came
to
despatch
agrippa
to
dacia
and
deccius
triccianus

deccius

the
former

been

restored

with
the
rest
by

had
taken
charge
of
his
decisions
and
letters
and
finally
had
been
degraded
to
the
position
of

rank

these
were
some
of
the
grounds
that
led
many
persons
to
find
fault
with
him

his
elevation

been
appointed

still
later
was
advanced
to
a
position
as

old
age
prevented
him
from
seeing
lack
of
education
from
reading
and
want
of
experience
from
being
able
to
accomplish
anything
the
emperor
made
him
senator
and
prefect
of
the
city
this
upstart
had
dared
to
say
to
the
soldiers
after
the
death
of
caracalla
the
sovereignty
properly
belongs
to
me
since
i
am
elder
than
macrinus
but
inasmuch
as
i
am
extremely
old
i
make
way
for
him
his
behavior
was
regarded
as
nonsensical
as
was
also
that
of
macrinus
in
granting
the
greatest
dignity
of
the
senate
to
such
a
man
who
could
not
when
consul
carry
on
a
plain
conversation
with
anybody
in
the
senate
and
consequently
on
the
day
of
elections
pretended
to
be
sick
hence
before
long
macrinus
assigned
the
direction
of
the
city
to
marius
maximus
in
his
stead
it
looked
as
if
he
had
made
him
præfectus
urbi
with
the
sole
purpose
of
polluting
the
and
this
pollution
took
place
not
only
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
had
served
in
the
mercenary
force
and
had
performed
the
duties
belonging
to
executioners
scouts
and
centurions
but
in
that
he
had
secured
control
of
the
city
prior
to
fulfilling
the
demands
of
the
consulship
in
other
words
he
became
city
prefect
before
senator
macrinus
connived
at
his
promotion
with
the
definite
intention
of
blinding
the
public
in
regard
to
his
own
record
which
would
have
shown
that
he
had
seized
the
imperial
office
while
yet
a
knight
sidenote
besides
these
not
unmerited
censures
that
some
passed
upon
him
he
also
attracted
adverse
criticism
for
designating
as
prefects
ulpius
julianus
and
julianus
nestor
who
possessed
no
particular
excellence
and
had
not
been
tested
in
many
undertakings
but
had
become
quite
notorious
for
rascality
in
caracalla
reign
for
being
at
the
head
of
the
late
prince
messengers
footnote
mommsen
thinks
that
by
this
expression
dio
probably
means
the
position
of
they
had
been
of
great
assistance
to
him
in
his
unholy
meddling
however
only
a
few
citizens
took
account
of
these
details
which
did
not
tend
wholly
to
encourage
them
the
majority
of
individuals
in
view
of
their
having
recently
got
rid
of
tarautas
which
was
more
than
they
could
have
hoped
and
comparing
the
new
ruler
in
the
few
indications
afforded
with
the
old
and
in
view
of
all
the
other
considerations
and
expectations
did
not
deem
it
fitting
to
condemn
him
so
soon
and
for
this
reason
they
mourned
him
exceedingly
when
he
was
killed
though
they
would
certainly
have
felt
hatred
for
him
had
he
lived
longer
for
he
began
to
live
rather
more
luxuriously
and
he
took
official
notice
of
those
who
reproved
him
his
putting
maternianus
and
datus
out
of
the
way
was
not
reasonable
for
what
wrong
had
they
done
in
being
attentive
to
their
emperor
but
it
was
not
unlike
human
nature
since
he
had
been
involved
in
great
danger
but
he
made
a
mistake
in
venting
his
wrath
upon
the
rest
who
were
suspected
of
disliking
his
low
birth
and
his
unexpected
attempt
upon
the
sovereign
power
he
ought
to
have
done
precisely
the
opposite
realizing
what
he
had
been
at
the
outset
and
what
his
position
then
was
he
should
not
have
been
supercilious
but
should
have
behaved
moderately

the
genius
of
his
household
and
encouraged
men
by
good
deeds

that

as

it
was
because
the
deeds

of

made

shrink
from
the

the

restrained
him
from

suspected
that
it
was
because
he
wanted
the
disgracing
to
be
the
act
of
the
senate
and
the
people

than
his
own
especially
since
he
was
in
the

of
the
legions

did
say
that
tarautas
by
his
wrongdoing
had
been
chiefly
responsible
for
the
war
and
had
terribly
burdened
the
public
treasury
by
increasing
the
money
given
to
the
barbarians
inasmuch
as
it
was
of
equal
amount
with

no
one
dared
however
to
give
utterance
publicly
to
any
such
statement
against
him
and
vote
that
he
was
an
enemy
for
fear
of
immediate
annihilation
at
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
in
the
city
still
they
abused
him
in
their
own

heaped

upon

although
they
did

they
did

of
the

of

to
that

as
they
pretended

with
enconiums
and
with

they
also
showed
for
the

no
indication
of
annoyance
at

the
reason
being
that
they
were
so
overwhelmed
by
joy
on
account
of
the
death
of
tarautas
as
not
to
have
leisure
to
think
anything
about
his
humble
origin
and
they
were
glad
to
accept
him
as
emperor
they
were
less
concerned
about
whose
slaves
they
should
be
next
than
about
whose
yoke
they
had
shaken
off
and
were
impressed
with
the
idea
that
any
chance
comer
who
might
present
himself
would
be
preferable
to
their
former

all
the
unusual

were
rehearsed
that

been
made
not
only
by
the
roman
treasury
but
privately
for
any
persons
and
on
the
part
of
any
foreign
nations
as
a
result
of
the
former
sovereign
direction
and
thus
the
overthrow
of
those
charged
with
carrying
out
the
enactments
made
by
him
and
the
hope
that
in
the
future
nothing
similar
would

to
be
satisfied

the

however
they
soon
learned
that
aurelianus
was
dead
and
that
diadumenianus
son
of

had
been
appointed

last
was
nominally
the
act
of
the
soldiers
through
whose
ranks
he
passed
when
summoned
from
antioch
to
meet
his
father
but
really
it
was
accomplished
by

further
learned
that
their
ruler
had
assumed
the
name
of
antoninus
he
had
done
this
to
win
the
favor
of
the
soldiers
partly
to
avoid
seeming
to
dishonor
his
predecessor
memory
entirely
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
secretly
thrown
down
some
of
the
statues
offered
to
him
in
rome
by
alexander
and
set
on
pedestals
by
antoninus
himself
and
again
he
wanted
to
get
an
excuse
for
promising
them
seven
hundred
and
fifty
denarii
more

persons
began
to
think
differently
and
reflected
that
previously
they
had
held
him
in
no
esteem
taking
account
furthermore
of
all
the
additional
ignoble
manifestations
on
his
part
that
they
suspected
and
thought
likely
they
began
to
be

raised
a
loud
cry
at
the
on
the
birthday
of

which
fell
on

uttered
many
lamentations
asserting
that

destitute

they

exclaimed

this

we
have
all
so

it
is
that

respect
is
a

characteristic

element
and
contempt
a
characteristic
of
the
worse
for
these
two
now
regarded
macrinus
and
diadumenianus
as
henceforth
absolutely
and
trampled
upon
their
claims
as
though
they
were
already
dead
this
was
one
great
reason
why
his
soldiers
despised
him
and
paid
no
heed
to
what
was
done
to
win
their
favor
another
still
more
important
cause
lay
in
the
frequent
and
extraordinary
insolence
shown
toward
him
by
the
pergamenians
who
were
deprived
of
what
they
had
formerly
received
from
tarautas
and
for
this
conduct
he
imposed
upon
them
public
sentence
of
loss
of

sidenote
the
attitude
of
the
soldiers
is
straightway
to
be
described
at
this
time
macrinus
neither
sent
to
the
senate
as
they
were
demanding
nor
published
otherwise
any
document
of
the

either
truly

falsely
to
avoid
a
great
disturbance
that
none
such
had
been
found
in

royal
residence
for

had
either
destroyed
the
majority
of
those
containing
any
accusation
or
had
returned
them
to
the
senders
themselves
as
i

stated

the
passage
to
which
dio
refers
is
lost
to
the
end
that
no
proof
of
his
baseness
should
be
left
but
he
did
reveal
the
names
of
three
senators
whom
from
what
he
had
himself
discovered
he
deemed
to
be
especially
deserving
of
hatred
these
were
manilius

had
blackmailed

the

is
here
a
question
of
a

only
be

perhaps
the
person
entrusted
with
the
execution
of
this
ruling
was

of

the
orphans
probably
during
the
latter
portion
of
reign
as
also
under
commodus
the
funds
for
food
had
been
available
either
not
at
all
or
at
irregular
intervals
and
therefore
the
restitution
of
district
prefects
was
determined
upon
from
these
food
prefects
for
a
particular
district
those
officials
must
be
distinguished
who
bear
the
general
title
of
without
any
local
limitation
and
show
a
marked
difference
from
the
rest
in
that
they
are
invariably
of
consular
rank
whereas
the
position
of
district
prefect
like
that
of
curator
of
roads
was
usually
held
by
a
candidate
that
had
only
passed
the
prætorship
the
inscriptions
of
these
prefects
begin
not
earlier
than
the
end
of
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
perhaps
not
till
commodus
and
extend
to
the
time
of
macrinus
while
during
this
whole
time
a
period
that
is
of
about
forty
years
all
trace
of
the
district
prefects
vanishes
under
these
circumstances
the
conclusion
seems
to
me
inevitable
that
towards
the
end
of
the
second
century
probably
from
the
first
years
of
marcus
aurelius
on
the
district
prefecture
was
abolished
and
the
administration
was
centralized
in
rome
under
a
consular
whose
authority
extended
over
the
whole
of
italy
now
very
probably
it
was
the
introduction
under
marcus
aurelius
of
the
which
occasioned
this
change
even
if
not
immediately
and
that
these
duties
of
distribution
as
well
as
other
administrative
functions
were
placed
in
their
hands
one
thing
that
would
seem
to
recommend
this
view
particularly
is
that
their
position
in
general
tended
to
make
them
official
examiners
of
the
affairs
of
the
when
in
addition
we
have
evidence
that
macrinus
in
the
year
reduced
the
authority
of
the
to
the
limits
originally
imposed
by
marcus
aurelius
and
that
further
the
same
emperor
instituted
certain
rulings
for
the
amelioration
of
food
distribution
when
moreover
we
consider
in
connection
with
this
the
coincidence
of
the
disappearance
of
the
food
for
italy
on
the
one
hand
and
the
reappearance
of
the
district
on
the
other
it
will
not
appear
overbold
to
suppose
that
macrinus
in
the
course
of
the
reform
affecting
the
also
detached
from
them
the
right
to
supervise

restored
it
to

that

moreover
he
affected
to

to

so
this

sprung
from

the
fact
that
it
seemed

a

upon
the

this
accordingly
gave
rise
to
a
feeling
that
something
out
of
the
ordinary
was
in
process

consummation

the
idea
was
strengthened
by
the
behavior
on

the

i
am
now
to
describe
macrinus
seeing
that
artabanus
was
exceedingly
angry
at
the
way
he
had
been
treated
and
had
invaded
mesopotamia
with
a
large
force
at
first
of
his
own
accord
sent
him
the
captives
and
used
friendly
language
urging
him
to
accept
peace
and
laying
the
blame
for
the
past
upon
tarautas
but
the
other
would
not
entertain
his
proposition
and
furthermore
bade
him
build
up
the
forts
and
demolished
cities
abandon
mesopotamia
entirely
and
offer
satisfaction
in
general
but
particularly
for
the
damage
to
the
royal
tombs
for
trusting
in
the
large
force
that
he
had
gathered
and
despising
macrinus
as
an
unworthy
emperor
he
gave
reign
to
his
wrath
and
expected
that
even
without
the
roman
consent
he
could
accomplish
whatever
he
wished
macrinus
had
no
opportunity
to
think
it
over
but
meeting
the
enemy
already
on
the
way
to
nisibis
was
defeated
in
a
battle
begun
by
the
soldiers
about
water
while
encamped
opposite
each
other
and
he
came
very
near
losing
the
rampart
itself
but
some
and
happened
along
and
saved
it
in
their
confidence
they
had
started
out
ahead
and
made
a
rush
upon
the
barbarians
and
the
unexpectedness
of
their
sally
was
of
advantage
to
them
making
them
appear
to
be
armed
soldiers
and
not
mere
helpers
but
the
lacuna
both
was
not
present
then
and

the
night

and

as
a
result
lacuna
from
mesopotamia
especially
lacuna
they
overran
syria
lacuna
he
abandoned
sidenote
this
took
place
at
the
season
under
consideration
but
in
the
autumn
and
winter
during
which
macrinus
and
adventus
became
consuls
they
no
longer
came
to
blows
with
each
other
but
kept
up
an
interchange
of
envoys
and
heralds
until
they
had
reached
an
agreement
sidenote
for
macrinus
through
native
cowardice
being
a
moor
he
was
tremendously
timorous
and
by
reason
of
the
soldiers
lack
of
discipline
did
not
dare
to
begin
a
war
on
the
contrary
he
expended
for
the
sake
of
peace
enormous
amounts
in
the
shape
of
both
gifts
and
money
to
artabanus
himself
and
to
his
assistants
in
the
government
so
that
the
entire
outlay
came
to
five
thousand
myriads
and
the
emperor
was
not
unwilling
to
effect
a
reconciliation
both
for
the
reasons
mentioned
and
because
his
soldiers
were
extremely
restive
a
condition
due
to
their
having
been
away
from
home
an
unusual
length
of
time
as
well
as
to
the
scarcity
of
food
no
supplies
were
to
be
had
from
stores
since
there
were
no
stores
ready
nor
from
the
country
itself
because
part
had
been
devastated
and
part
was
controlled
by
forts
macrinus
however
did
not
forward
an
exact
account
of
all
their
proceedings
to
the
senate
and
consequently
triumphal
sacrifices
were
voted
him
and
the
name
of
parthicus
was
bestowed
but
this
he
would
not
accept
being
apparently
ashamed
to
adopt
the
appellation
of
an
enemy
by
whom
he
had
been
defeated
moreover
the
war
that
had
been
waged
in
the
regions
of
the
armenian
king
subsided
tiridates
received
the
diadem
sent
him
by
macrinus
and
got
back
his
mother
whom
tarautas
had
confined
in
prison
eleven
months
together
with
the
booty
captured
from
armenia
and
all
the
territory
that
his
father
possessed
in
cappadocia
with
hopes
of
obtaining
the
annual
payment
often
furnished
by
the
romans
and
the
dacians
after
damaging
parts
of
dacia
held
their
hands
in
spite
of
a
desire
for
further
conflict
and
got
back
the
hostages
that
caracalla
under
the
name
of
an
alliance
had
taken
from
them
this
was
the
course
of
these
events
sidenote
but
a
new
war
broke
upon
the
heads
of
the
romans
and
no
longer
a
foreign
but
a
civil
strife
it
was
the
soldiers
who
were
responsible
for
the
outbreak
they
were
somewhat
irritated
by
their
setbacks
but
their
behavior
was
owing
still
more
to
the
fact
that
they
would
no
longer
endure
any
hard
work
if
they
could
help
it
but
were
thoroughly
out
of
training
in
every
respect
and
wanted
to
have
no
emperor
that
ruled
with
a
firm
hand
but
demanded
that
they
get
everything
without
stint
and
chose
to
perform
no
task
that
was
fitting
for
them
they
were
further
angered
by
the
cutting
off
of
their
pay
and
the
deprivation
of
prizes
and
exemptions
these
last
among
the
privileges
of
the
military
which
they
had
gained
from
tarautas
even
though
they
personally
were
not
destined
to
be
affected
by
these
measures
their
resolution
was
definitely
strengthened
by
the
delay
which
they
had
undergone
in
practically
one
and
the
same
spot
while
wintering
in
syria
on
account
of
the
war
it
should
be
stated
that
macrinus
seemed
to
have
shown
good
generalship
and
to
have
acted
sensibly
in
debarring
the
men
in
arms
from
no
privilege
but
preserving
to
them
intact
all
the
rights
allowed
by
his
predecessor
whereas
he
gave
notice
to
such
as
intended
to
enlist
anew
that
they
would
be
enrolled
only
upon
the
old
schedule
published
by
severus
he
hoped
that
these
recruits
entering
the
army
a
few
at
a
time
would
hold
aloof
from
rebellion
at
first
through
peaceful
inclinations
and
fear
and
later
through
the
influence
of
time
and
custom
and
that
by
having
no
corrupting
effect
upon
the
rest
they
would
quiet
them
sidenote
if
this
had
been
done
after
the
members
of
the
army
had
retired
to
their
individual
fortresses
and
were
consequently
scattered
it
would
have
been
a
correct
move
perhaps
some
of
them
would
not
have
shown
indignation
believing
that
they
would
really
be
put
at
no
disadvantage
because
temporarily
they
suffered
no
loss
and
even
if
they
had
been
vexed
yet
each
body
being
few
in
number
and
subservient
to
the
commanders
sent
by
the
senate
they
could
have
accomplished
no
great
harm
but
united
in
syria
they
suspected
that
they
should
be
liable
to
innovations
if
they
separated
for
the
time
being
they
could
well
believe
they
were
being
pampered
on
account
of
the
demands
of
war
and
again
lacuna
so
the
others
killed
certain
soldiers
and
ravaged
portions
of
mesopotamia
and
these
men
butchered
not
a
few
of
their
own
number
and
also
overthrew
their
emperor
and
what
is
still
worse
they
set
up
another
similar
ruler
by
whom
nothing
was
done
save
what
was
evil
and
base
sidenote
it
seems
to
me
that
this
occurrence
had
been
foreshadowed
more
clearly
perhaps
than
any
previous
event
a
very
distinct
eclipse
of
the
sun
had
taken
place
about
that
time
and
the

seen
for
a
considerable
period
and
another
luminary
whose
tail
extended
from
the
west
to
the
east
for
several
nights
caused
us
terrible
alarm

that

he

came
quickly
to
the
alban
soldiers
at

and
appointed
his
son
emperor
in
spite
of
the
lad
being
but
ten
years
old
in
order
that
with
this
excuse
he
might
mollify
the
soldiers
by
various
means

among
which
should
be
the
promise
of
five
thousand

he
assigned
them
a

on

and
restored
to
the
rest
complete

of

everything
else
of
which
they
had
been
deprived
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
appease
them
with
this

end
in
view
he
bestowed
upon
the
populace
a
dinner
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
denarii
a
head
before
revealing
to
them
anything
about
the
uprising
for
he
wanted
it
to
be
thought
that
he
was
banqueting
them
not
because
of
that
event
but
to
show
honor
to
his
son
and
on
that
occasion
first
one
of
the
revolted
soldiers
approached
him
carrying
the
head
of
julianus
who
had
been
found
somewhere
in
hiding
and
slain
in
many
linen
cloths
and
tied
up
very
strongly
indeed
with
ropes
pretending
it
was
the
head
of
the
false
antoninus
he
had
sealed
the
package
with
the
finger
ring
of
julianus
after
doing
that
the
soldier
ran
out
when
the
head
was
uncovered
macrinus
upon
discovering
what
had
been
done
no
longer
dared
either
to
stay
where
he
was
or
to
assault
the
fortification
but
returned
to
antioch
with
all
speed
so
the
alban
legion
and
the
rest
who
were
wintering
in
that
region
likewise
revolted
the
opposing
parties
continued
their
preparations
and
both
sides
sent
messengers
and
letters
to
the
provinces
and
to
the
legions
as
a
result
perturbation
was
caused
in
many
places
by
the
first
communication
of
each
side
about
the
other
and
by
the
constant
messages
contradicting
each
other
in
the
course
of
the
uncertainty
numerous
on
both
sides
lost
their
lives
and
numbers
of
those
who
had
slain
the
followers
of
antoninus
or
had
not
immediately
attached
themselves
to
their
cause
were
censured
some
perished
on
this
account
and
some
merely
incurred
a
small
loss
hence
i
will
pass
over
most
of
this
it
is
all
very
much
alike
and
permits
of
no
considerable
description
in
detail
and
will
give
a
summary
of
what
took
place
in
egypt
sidenote
the
governor
of
that
country
was
basilianus
whom
macrinus
had
also
made
prefect
in
place
of
julianus
some
interests
were
managed
also
by
marius
secundus
although
he
had
been
created
senator
by
macrinus
and
was
at
the
head
of
affairs
in
phoenicia
in
this
way
both
of
them
were
dependent
upon
macrinus
and
for
that
reason
put
to
death
the
runners
of
the
false
antoninus
as
long
therefore
as
the
outcome
of
the
business
was
still
in
dispute
they
and
the
soldiers
and
the
individuals
were
in
suspense
some
wishing
and
praying
and
reporting
one
thing
and
others
the
opposite
as
always
in
factional
disturbances
when
the
news
of
the
defeat
of
macrinus
arrived
a
riot
of
some
magnitude
followed
in
which
many
of
the
populace
and
not
a
few
of
the
soldiers
were
destroyed
secundus
found
himself
in
a
dilemma
and
basilianus
fearing
that
he
should
lose
his
life
instanter
effected
his
escape
from
egypt
after
coming
to
the
vicinity
of
brundusium
in
italy
he
was
discovered
having
been
betrayed
by
a
friend
in
rome
to
whom
he
had
sent
a
secret
message
asking
for
food
so
he
was
later
taken
back
to
nicomedea
and
executed
sidenote
macrinus
wrote
also
to
the
senate
about
the
false
antoninus
as
he
did
also
to
the
governors
everywhere
calling
him
boy
and
saying
that
he
was
mad
he
wrote
also
to
maximus
the
præfectus
urbi
giving
him
such
information
as
one
might
expect
and
further
stating
that
the
soldiers
recently
enlisted
insisted
upon
receiving
all
that
they
were
wont
to
have
before
and
that
the
rest
who
had
been
deprived
of
nothing
made
common
cause
with
them
in
their
anger
at
what
was
withheld
and
to
omit
a
recital
he
said
of
all
the
many
means
devised
by
severus
and
his
son
for
the
ruin
of
rigid
discipline
it
was
impossible
for
the
troops
to
be
given
their
entire
pay
in
addition
to
the
donatives
which
they
were
receiving
for
the
increase
in
their
pay
granted
by
tarautas
amounted
to
seven
thousand
myriads
annually
and
could
not
be
given
partly
because
the
soldiers
and
again
because
lacuna
righteous
lacuna
but
the
recognized
expenditures
lacuna
and
the
lacuna
could
he
himself
and
the
child
as
lacuna
himself
lacuna
and
he
commiserated
himself
upon
having
a
son
but
said
that
he
found
it
a
solace
in
his
disaster
to
think
that
he
had
outlived
the
fratricide
who
attempted
to
destroy
the
whole
world
he
also
added
to
the
missive
something
like
the
following
i
know
that
there
are
many
who
are
more
anxious
to
have
emperors
killed
than
to
have
them
live
but
this
is
one
thing
i
can
not
say
in
respect
to
myself
that
any
one
could
either
desire
or
pray
that
i
should
perish
at
which
fulvius
diogenianus
exclaimed
we
have
all
prayed
for
it
sidenote
the
speaker
was
one
of
the
but
not
of
very
sound
mind
and
consequently
he
caused
himself
as
much
exasperation
as
he
did
other
people
he
also
lacuna
the
subscription
lacuna
of

to

to
the
lacuna

the
common
preserver

over

that
the
false
antoninus
finding
in
the
chests
of
macrinus
not
yet
lacuna
he
himself
voluntarily
lacuna
published
lacuna
calumny
lacuna
making
with
reference
to
the
soldiers
and
he
marched
so
quickly
against
him
that
macrinus
could
with
difficulty
encounter
him
in
a
village
of
the
antiochians
one
hundred
and
fifty
stades
distant
from
the
city
there
so
far
as
the
zeal
of
the
pretorians
went
he
had
him
conquered
he
had
taken
from
them
their
breastplates
scales
and
their
grooved
shields
and
had
thus
rendered
them
lighter
for
the
battle
but
he
was
beaten
by
his
own
cowardice
as
heaven
had
foreshown
to
him
for
on
that
day
when
his
first
letter
about
the
imperial
office
was
read
to
us
a
pigeon
had
lighted
upon
an
image
of
severus
whose
name
he
had
applied
to
himself
that
stood
in
the
and
subsequently
when
the
communication
about
his
son
was
sent
we
had
convened
not
at
the
bidding
of
the
consuls
or
the
prætors
for
they
did
not
happen
to
be
present
but
of
the
tribunes
a
practice
which
by
this
time
had
fallen
more
or
less
into
disuse
and
he
had
not
written
even
his
name
in
the
preface
of
the
letter
though
he
termed
him
cæsar
and
emperor
and
indicated
that
the
contents
emanated
from
them
both
also
in
the
rehearsal
of
events
he
mentioned
the
name
diadumenianus
but
left
out
that
of
antoninus
though
he
had
this
title
too
such
was
the
state
of
these
sidenote
affairs
and
by
jupiter
when
he
sent
word
about
the
uprising
of
the
false
antoninus
the
consuls
uttered
certain
formulæ
against
him
as
is
regularly
done
under
such
circumstances
and
one
of
the
prætors
and
another
of
the
tribunes
did
the
same
war
was
declared
and
solemnly
proclaimed
against
the
usurper
and
his
cousin
and
their
mothers
and
their
grandmother
and
immunity
was
granted
to
those
that
had
taken
part
in
the
uprising
in
case
they
should
submit
according
as
macrinus
had
promised
them
for
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
the
soldiers
was
read
aloud
as
a
result
of
this
we
all
condemned
still
more
strongly
his
abasement
and
folly
for
one
thing
he
was
most
constantly
calling
himself
father
and
diadumenianus
his
son
and
he
kept
holding
up
to
reproach
the
age
of
the
false
antoninus
though
he
had
designated
as
emperor
his
son
who
was
much
younger
now
in
the
battle
gannys
hurriedly
took
possession
of
the
narrow
place
in
front
of
the
village
and
disposed
his
soldiers
in
good
order
for
warfare
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
was
most
inexperienced
in
military
matters
of
such
surpassing
importance
is
good
fortune
in
comparison
with
other
qualifications
that
it
actually
bestows
understanding
upon
the
ignorant
but
his
army
made
a
very
weak
fight
and
the
men
would
not
have
stood
their
ground
had
not
mæsa
and
soæmias
for
they
were
already
in
the
boy
retinue
leaped
down
from
their
vehicles
and
rushing
among
the
fugitives
by
their
lamentations
restrained
them
from
flight
and
had
not
the
lad
himself
been
seen
by
them
by
some
divine
disposition
of
affairs
with
drawn
sword
on
horseback
charging
the
enemy
even
so
they
would
have
turned
their
backs
again
had
not
macrinus
fled
at
sight
of
their
resistance
sidenote
the
latter
having
been
thus
defeated
on
the
eighth
of
june
sent
his
son
in
charge
of
epagathus
and
some
other
attendants
to
artabanus
king
of
the
parthians
he
himself
went
to
antioch
giving
out
that
victory
was
his
to
the
end
that
he
might
be
offered
shelter
there
then
when
the
news
of
his
defeat
became
noised
abroad
in
the
midst
of
many
consequent
slaughters
both
along
the
roads
and
in
the
city
springing
from
somebody
favoring
the
one
side
or
the
other
he
made
his
escape
from
antioch
he
proceeded
by
night
on
horseback
with
his
head
and
whole
chin
shaved
and
attired
in
a
dark
garment
worn
over
his
purple
robe
in
order
that
he
might
so
far
as
possible
resemble
an
ordinary
citizen
in
this
way
with
a
few
companions
he
reached
ægæ
in
cilicia
and
there
by
pretending
to
be
one
of
the
soldiers
that
carried
messages
he
got
a
wagon
on
which
he
drove
through
cappadocia
and
galatia
and
bithynia
as
far
as
the
shipyard
of
eribolus
which
is
opposite
the
city
of
nicomedea
it
was
his
intention
to
make
his
way
back
to
rome
expecting
that
there
he
could
gain
some
assistance
from
the
senate
and
from
the
people
and
if
he
had
escaped
thither
he
would
certainly
have
accomplished
something
for
their
disposition
was
decidedly
more
favorable
to
him
in
view
of
the
hardihood
of
the
syrians
the
age
of
the
false
antoninus
and
the
uncontrolledness
of
gannys
and
comazon
so
that
even
the
soldiers
would
either
voluntarily
footnote

greek
instead
of

thnhêschontast
have
changed
their
attitude
or
refusing
to
do
so
would
have
been
overpowered
as
it
turned
out
however
if
any
one
recognized
him
in
the
course
of
his
journey
so
far
described
at
least
no
one
ventured
to
lay
hands
on
him
but
he
came
to
grief
on
his
voyage
from
eribolus
to
chalcedon
he
did
not
dare
to
enter
nicomedea
through
fear
of
the
governor
of
bithynia
cæcilius
aristo
and
so
he
sent
to
one
of
the
procurators
asking
for
money
and
in
this
way
he
became
known
he
was
overtaken
while
still
in

on
the
arrival

country
bordering
on
his

also
were

incurred
blame
because
they
were
not
pleased
with
what
he
was
doing
he
did
not
hesitate
to
write
this
statement
about
them
to
the
senate

called
them
investigators
of
his
habits

life

censors

proceedings
in

the
proofs

their
plot

said
because
it
would
be
useless
to
read
them
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
men
are
already
dead
there
was
another
cause
of
dislike
underlying
the
case
against
messala
the
point
namely
that
he
sturdily
made
public
many
facts
in
the
senate
this
was
what
led
the
emperor
at
the
outset
to
send
for
him
to
come
to
syria
pretending
to
have
very
great
need
of
him
whereas
his
real
fear
was
that
messala
might
bring
about
a
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
senators
the
cause
in
the
case
of
bassus
was
that
he
had
a
wife
both
fair
to
look
upon
and
of
noble
rank
she
was
a
descendant
of
claudius
severus

both
married

an
account

as
the
most
impious
of
men
to
be
sure
gannys
was
living
rather
luxuriously
and
was
fond
of
accepting
bribes
but
for
all
that
he
brought
no
injury
upon
anybody
and
bestowed
many
benefits
upon
many
people
most
of
all
he
always
showed
a
deep
respect
for
the
emperor
and
he
was
thoroughly
satisfactory
to
mæsa
and
soæmias
suiting
the
former
because
she
had
brought
him
up
and
the
latter
because
he
practically
lived
with
her
but
these
were
not
the
reasons
why
the
emperor
put
him
out
of
the
way
seeing
that
he
was
willing
to
give
him
a
marriage
contract
and
appoint
him
cæsar
it
was
rather
that
gannys
compelled
him
to
live
temperately
and
prudently
and
his
own
hand
was
the
first
to
give
his
minister
a
mortal
blow
since
no
one
of
the
soldiers
had
the
hardihood

their
heads
to

at

i
have
mentioned
them
alone
by
name
not
so
much

they
were
the
only
ones
who
appeared
entirely
insane

because
they

in

at
cyzicus
when
the
false
antoninus
was
wintering
at
nicomedea
and
there
were
many
others
elsewhere
so
that
it
became
a
very
ordinary
thing
for
those
who
so
wished
to
hazard
the
chance
of
fomenting
rebellion
and
becoming
emperor
they
were
encouraged
partly
by
the
fact
that
many
persons
had
entered
upon
the
supreme
office
without
expecting
or
deserving
it
let
no
one
be
incredulous
of
my
statements
for
the
facts
about
the
private
citizens
i
ascertained
from
men
who
are
worthy
of
confidence
and
of
what
i
have
written
about
the

i
gained
an
exact
knowledge
in

close
at
hand
the
affairs
of
which
as
also
of
smyrna
i
managed
having
been
assigned
to
duty
there
by
macrinus
and
in
view
of
this
attempt
none
of
the
others
seemed
at
all
incredible
to
me
sidenote
this
is
what
he
did
in
the
way
of
murders
his
acts
which
varied
from
our
ancestral
precedents
however
were
of
simple
character
and
inflicted
no
great
harm
upon
us
some
noteworthy
innovations
were
his
applying
to
himself
certain
titles
connected
with
his
sovereignty
before
they
had
been
voted
as
i
have
already
described
footnote
see
chapter
and
again
his
enrolling
himself
in
the
consulship
in
place
of
macrinus
when
he
had
not
been
elected
to
it
and
did
not
enter
upon
any
of
its
duties
the
time
expiring
too
soon
yet
at
first
in
three
letters
he
had
referred
to
the
year
by
the
name
of
adventus
as
if
assuming
that
the
latter
had
been
sole
consul
other
points
were
that
he
undertook
to
be
consul
a
second
time
without
having
secured
any
office
previously
or
the
privileges
of
any
office
and
that
while
consul
in
nicomedea
he
did
not
employ
the
triumphal
costume
on
the
day
of
vows

the
compitalia
iii
non
sidenote
with
his
infractions
of
law
is
connected
also
the
matter
of
elagabalus
the
offence
consisted
not
in
his
introducing
a
foreign
god
into
rome
or
in
his
exalting
him
in
very
strange
ways
but
in
his
placing
him
before
even
jupiter
and
having
himself
voted
his
priest
in
his
circumcising
his
foreskin
and
abstaining
from
swine
flesh
on
the
ground
that
his
devotion
would
be
purer
by
this
means
he
had
thought
of
cutting
off
his
genitals
altogether
but
that
was
an
idea
prompted
by
salaciousness
the
circumcision
which
he
actually
accomplished
was
a
part
of
the
priestly
requirements
of
elagabalus
hence
he
mutilated
in
like
manner
numerous
of
his
associates
a
further
offence
was
his
being
frequently
seen
in
public
clad
in
the
barbaric
dress
which
the
syrian
priests
employ
a
circumstance
which
had
more
to
do
than
anything
else

found
considerable
money
in
the
treasury
squandered
it
all
and
incomes
did
not
suffice
for
expenditures
sidenote
sidenote
as
to
his
marriage
he
espoused
cornelia
paula
in
order
that
he
might
sooner
these
are
his
words
become
a
father
he
who
could
not
even
be
a
man
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
not

the
senate

the
equestrian
order

also
the
wives

some
distribution
of
presents
the
people
were
given
a
banquet
at
the
per
capita
rate
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
denarii
and
the
soldiers
had
one
that
cost
a
hundred
more
there
were
contests
of
gladiators
at
which
the
prince
wore
a
toga
the
same
as
he
had
done
at
the
ludi
votivi
various
beasts
were
slain
among
them
an
elephant
and
tigers
a
greater
number
than
had
ever
yet
been
despatched

one
time
afterwards
he
dismissed
paula
on
the
pretext
that
she
had
some
blemish
on
her
person
and
cohabited
with
aqulia
severa
a
most
flagrant
breach
of
law
she
was
consecrated
to
vesta
and
yet
he
most
sinfully
ravished
her
and
actually
dared
to
say
i
did
it
in
order
that
godlike
children
may
spring
from
me
the
and
from
her
the
he
felicitated
himself
on
an
act
which
was
destined
to
lead
to
his
being
maltreated
in
the
forum
and
thrown
into
prison
and
subsequently
put
to
death
however
he
did
not
keep
even
this
woman
for
long
but
married
a
second
and
then
a
third
and
still
another
after
that
he
went
back
to
severa
sidenote
portents
had
been
taking
place
in
rome
one
of
them
on
the
statue
of
isis
which
is
borne
upon
a
dog
above
the
pediment
of
her
temple
it
consisted
in
her
turning
her
face
towards
the
sardanapalus
was
conducting
games
and
numerous
spectacles
in
which
helix
the
athlete
won
renown
how
far
he
surpassed
his
adversaries
is
shown
by
his
wishing
to
contend
in
both
wrestling
and
pancratium
at
olympia
and
by
his
winning
victories
in
both
at
the
capitolina
the
eleans
being
jealous
of
him
and
through
fear
that
he
might
prove
the
eighth
from
hercules
as
the
saying
is
footnote
the
history
and
significance
of
this
proverb
are
not
known
would
not
call
any
wrestler
into
the
stadium
in
spite
of
their
having
inscribed
this
contest
on
the
but
in
rome
he
won
each
of
the
two
games
a
feat
that
no
one
else
had
accomplished
sidenote
and
here
i
must
omit
mention
of
the
barbaric
chants
which
sardanapalus
chanted
to
elagabalus
and
his
mother
and
grandmother
all
three
as
also
of
the
secret
sacrifices
that
he
offered
to
him
at
these
he
slaughtered
boys
and
used
charms
besides
shutting
up
in
the
god
temple
a
live
lion
and
monkey
and
snake
throwing
in
among
them
human
genitals
and
practicing
other
unholy
rites
while
he
wore
invariably
innumerable
amulets
sidenote
but
to
run
briefly
over
these
matters
he
actually
most
ridiculous
of
all
courted
a
wife
for
elagabalus
on
the
assumption
that
the
god
wanted
marriage
and
children
such
a
wife
might
be
neither
poor
nor
and
so
he
chose
the
carthaginian
urania
summoned
her
to
come
thence
and
established
her
in
the
palace
he
gathered
wedding
gifts
for
her
from
all
his
subjects
as
he
might
have
done
in
the
case
of
his
own
wives
all
these
presents
that
were
given
during
his
lifetime
were
exacted
later
but
in
the
way
of
dowry
he
declared
that
nothing
should
be
brought
save
the
gold
lions
which
were
melted
down
sidenote
but
this
sardanapalus
who
thought
it
right
to
make
the
gods
cohabit
under
the
form
of
marriage
himself
lived
from
first
to
last
most
licentiously
he
married
many
women
and
had
liaisons
with
many
more
without
any
lawful
title
yet
it
was
not
that
he
cared
about
them
he
simply
wanted
to
imitate
their
actions
when
he
should
lie
with
his
lovers
and
get
accomplices
in
his
excesses
by
returning
to
them
indiscriminately
he
used
his
body
for
doing
and
allowing
many
unheard
of
things
which
no
one
would
endure
telling
or
hearing
but
his
most
conspicuous
acts
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceal
were
the
following
he
would
go
by
night
wearing
a
wig
of
long
hair
into
the
taverns
and
ply
the
trade
of
a
female
huckster
he
frequented
the
notorious
brothels
drove
out
the
prostitutes
and
prostituted
himself
finally
he
set
aside
a
room
in
the
palace
and
there
committed
his
indecencies
standing
all
the
time
naked
at
the
door
of
it
as
the
harlots
do
and
shaking
the
curtain
which
was
fastened
by
gold
rings
the
while
in
a
soft
and
melting
voice
he
solicited
the
certain
persons
had
been
given
special
orders
to
let
themselves
be
attracted
to
his
abode
for
as
in
other
matters
so
in
this
business
too
he
had
numerous
detectives
through
whom
he
sought
out
the
persons
who
could
please
him
most
by
their
foulness
he
would
collect
money
from
his
patrons
and
put
on
airs
over
his
gains
he
would
also
dispute
with
his
associates
in
this
shameful
occupation
saying
that
he
had
more
lovers
than
they
and
took
in
more
money
sidenote
this
is
the
way
he
behaved
to
all
alike
that
enjoyed
his
services
but
he
had
besides
one
chosen
man
whom
he
accordingly
desired
to
appoint
cæsar
also
arrayed
in
the
green
uniform
he
drove
a
chariot
privately
and
at
home
if
one
can
call
that
place
home
where
contests
were
conducted
by
the
foremost
of
his
suite
and
knights
and
cæsarians
the
very
prefects
his
grandmother
his
mother
his
women
and
likewise
several
members
of
the
senate
including
leo
the
præfectus
urbi
and
where
they
watched
him
playing
charioteer
and
begging
gold
coin
like
any
vagabond
and
bowing
down
before
the
managers
of
the
games
and
the
members
of
the
factions
now
in
trying
anybody
in
court
he
really
did
have
the
appearance
of
a
man
but
everywhere
else
his
actions
and
the
quality
of
his
voice
showed
the
wantonness
of
youth
for
instance
he
used
to
dance
not
only
in
the
orchestra
but
more
or
less
also
while
walking
performing
sacrifice
greeting
friends
or
making
speeches
and
finally
to
go
back
now
to
the
story
which
i
began
he
was
bestowed
in
marriage
and
was
termed
wife
mistress
queen
he
worked
in
wool
sometimes
wore
a
painted
his
eyes
daubing
them
with
white
lead
and
alkanet
and
once
he
shaved
his
chin
and
celebrated
a
festival
to
mark
the
event
after
that
he
went
with
smooth
face
because
it
would
help
him
appear
like
a
woman
and
he
often
reclined
while
greeting
the
senators
sidenote
her
husband
was
hierocles
a
carian
slave
once
the
favorite
of
gordius
from
whom
he
had
learned
it
was
in
this
connection
also
that
by
a
most
unexpected
chance
he
won
the
imperial
approbation
at
a
heirocles
fell
out
of
his
chariot
just
opposite
the
seat
of
sardanapalus
losing
his
helmet
in
his
fall
being
still
beardless
and
adorned
with
a
crown
of
yellow
hair
he
attracted
the
attention
of
the
prince
and
was
at
once
carried
hastily
to
the
palace
and
by
his
nocturnal
feats
he
captivated
sardanapalus
more
than
ever
and
rose
to
still
greater
power
consequently
his
influence
became
even
greater
than
his
patron
and
it
was
thought
a
small
thing
that
his
mother
while
still
a
slave
should
be
brought
to
rome
by
soldiers
and
be
numbered
among
the
wives
of
certain
other
persons
too
were
not
seldom
honored
by
the
emperor
and
became
powerful
some
because
they
had
joined
in
his
uprising
and
others
because
they
committed
adultery
with
him
for
he
was
anxious
to
have
the
reputation
of
committing
adultery
that
in
this
respect
too
he
might
imitate
the
most
lascivious
women
and
he
would
often
get
caught
voluntarily
and
in
the
very
act
then
for
his
conduct
he
would
be
brutally
abused
by
his
husband
and
would
be
beaten
so
that
he
had
black
eyes
his
affection
for
this
husband
was
no
light
inclination
but
a
serious
matter
and
a
firmly
fixed
passion
so
much
so
that
he
did
not
become
vexed
at
any
such
harsh
treatment
but
on
the
contrary
loved
him
the
more
for
it
and
actually
wished
to
appoint
him
cæsar
he
threatened
his
grandmother
when
she
interfered
and
chiefly
on
this
man
account
he
became
at
odds
with
the
soldiers
it
was
this
that
was
destined
to
lead
his
destruction
sidenote
as
for
aurelius
zoticus
a
native
of
smyrna
whom
they
also
called
cook
from
his
father
trade
he
incurred
the
sovereign
thorough
love
and
thorough
hatred
and
consequently
his
life
was
saved
this
aurelius
had
a
body
that
was
beautiful
all
over
as
if
ready
for
a
gymnastic
contest
and
he
surpassed
everybody
in
the
size
of
his
private
parts
the
fact
was
reported
to
the
emperor
by
those
who
were
on
the
lookout
for
such
features
and
the
man
was
suddenly
snatched
away
from
the
games
and
taken
to
rome
accompanied
by
an
immense
procession
larger
than
abgarus
had
in
the
reign
of
severus
or
tiridates
in
that
of
nero
he
was
appointed
cubicularius
before
he
had
been
even
seen
by
the
emperor
was
honored
by
the
name
of
his
grandfather
avitus
was
adorned
with
garlands
as
at
a
festival
and
entered
the
palace
the
center
of
a
great
glare
of
lights
sardanapalus
on
seeing
him
rose
with
modesty
the
newcomer
addressed
him
as
was
usual
my
lord
emperor
hail
whereupon
the
other
bending
his
neck
so
as
to
assume
a
ravishing
feminine
pose
and
turning
his
eyes
wide
open
upon
him
answered
without
hesitation
call
me
not
lord
for
i
am
a
lady
then
sardanapalus
immediately
took
a
bath
with
him
and
finding
his
guest
when
stripped
to
correspond
to
the
report
of
him
burned
with
even
greater
lust
reposed
upon
his
breast
and
took
dinner
like
some
loved
mistress
in
his
bosom
hierocles
began
to
fear
that
zoticus
would
bring
the
emperor
into
a
greater
state
of
subjection
than
he
himself
was
able
to
effect
and
that
he
might
suffer
some
terrible
fate
at
his
hands
as
often
happens
in
the
case
of
rival
lovers
therefore
he
had
the
who
were
to
him
administer
some
drug
that
abated
the
visitor
ferocity
and
so
zoticus
after
a
whole
night
of
embarrassment
being
unable
to
secure
an
erection
was
deprived
of
all
that
he
had
obtained
and
was
driven
out
of
the
palace
out
of
rome
and
later
out
of
the
remainder
of
italy
and
this
saved
his
life
however
the
emperor
drove
himself
to
such
a
frenzy
of
lewdness
that
he
asked
the
physicians
to
contrive
a
woman
vagina
in
his
person
by
means
of
an
incision
and
held
out
to
them
the
hope
of
great
pay
for
this
achievement
sidenote
sardanapalus
himself
was
destined
not
much
later
to
receive
his
pay
for
his
own
defilement
for
his
acting
in
this
way
and
for
making
himself
the
object
of
these
actions
he
became
hated
by
the
populace
and
by
the
soldiers
to
whom
he
was
most
attached
and
at
last
he
was
slain
by
them
in
the
very
camp
false
antoninus
was
despised
and
put
out
of
the
way
by
the
soldiers
when
any
persons
particularly
if
armed
have
accustomed
themselves
to
feel
contempt
for
their
rulers
they
set
no
limits
on
their
right
to
do
what
they
please
but
keep
their
arms
ready
to
use
even
against
the
very
man
who
gave
them
whatever
rights
they
possess
sidenote
this
is
how
it
happened
he
introduced
his
cousin
bassianus
before
the
senate
and
having
stationed
mæsa
and
soæmias
on
either
hand
adopted
him
as
his
child
then
did
he
congratulate
himself
on
being
suddenly
the
father
of
so
large
a
child
as
if
he
surpassed
him
in
age
and
declared
that
he
needed
no
other
offspring
to
keep
his
house
free
from
despondency
elagabalus
he
said
had
ordered
him
to
do
this
and
further
to
call
his
son
name
alexander
and
i
for
my
part
am
persuaded
that
it
came
about
in
very
truth
by
some
divine
intention
and
i
base
my
inference
not
upon
what
he
said
but
upon
what
was
said
to
him
by
some
one
that
an
alexander
would
come
from
emesa
to
succeed
him
and
again
on
what
took
place
in
upper
moesia
and
in
thrace
sidenote
a
little
before
this
a
spirit
declaring
that
he
was
the
famous
alexander
of
macedon
wearing
his
appearance
and
all
his
apparatus
started
from
the
regions
near
the
ister
appearing
there
in
i
know
not
what
way
it
traversed
thrace
and
asia
reveling
in
company
with
four
hundred
male
attendants
who
were
equipped
with
thyrsi
and
and
did
no
harm
the
fact
was
admitted
by
all
those
who
lived
in
thrace
at
that
time
that
lodgings
and
all
the
provisions
for
it
were
provided
at
public
expense
and
no
one
dared
to
oppose
it
either
by
word
or
by
deed
no
governor
no
soldier
no
procurator
no
heads
of
provinces
but
it
proceeded
as
if
in
a
daylight
procession
prescribed
by
proclamation
to
the
confines
of
bithynia
leaving
that
point
it
approached
the
chalcedonian
land
and
there
after
performing
some
sacred
rite
by
night
and
burying
a
wooden
horse
it
vanished
these
facts
i
ascertained
while
still
in
asia
as
i
stated
and
before
anything
at
all
had
been
done
about
bassianus
in
rome
day
the
same
man
said
this
i
have
no
need
of
titles
derived
from
war
and
blood
it
suffices
me
to
have
you
call
me
and
false
antoninus
on
receiving
praise
from
the
senate
one
day
remarked
yes
you
love
me
and
by
jupiter
so
does
the
populace
and
likewise
the
foreign
legions
but
i
do
not
satisfy
the
pretorians
to
whom
i
keep
giving
so
much
sidenote
sidenote
so
long
as
sardanapalus
continued
to
love
his
cousin
he
was
safe
but
since
he
was
suspicious
of
all
men
and
learned
that
their
favor
was
turning
solely
and
absolutely
to
the
boy
he
dared
to
change
his
mind
and
worked
in
every
way
to
effect
his
overthrow
persons
were
conversing
with
the
false
antoninus
and
remarked
how
fortunate
he
was
to
be
consul
along
with
his
son
he
rejoined
i
shall
be
more
fortunate
next
year
for
then
going
to
be
consul
with
my
son
the
moment
though
that
he
tried
to
destroy
him
he
not
only
accomplished
nothing
but
ran
the
risk
of
being
killed
himself
alexander
was
sedulously
guarded
by
his
mother
and
his
grandmother
and
the
soldiers
and
the
pretorians
on
becoming
aware
of
the
attempt
of
sardanapalus
raised
a
terrible
tumult
they
would
not
cease
their
rebellious
attitude
until
sardanapalus
with
alexander
visited
the
camp
and
he
poured
out
his
supplications
and
under
compulsion
gave
up
such
of
his
companions
in
lewdness
as
the
soldiers
demanded
in
behalf
of
hierocles
he
pled
piteously
and
lamented
him
with
tears
foretelling
his
own
death
and
adding
grant
me
this
one
man
whatever
you
are
pleased
to
suspect
about
him
or
else
kill
me
and
thus
with
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
appeasing
them
on
this
occasion
then
he
was
saved
though
with
difficulty
his
grandmother
hated
him
for
his
practices
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
not
the
son
of
antoninus
and
was
coming
to
favor
alexander
as
being
really
sprung
from
him
sidenote
later
he
again
made
a
plot
against
alexander
and
as
the
pretorians
raised
an
outcry
at
this
entered
the
camp
with
him
then
he
became
aware
that
he
was
under
guard
and
awaiting
execution
for
the
mothers
of
the
two
being
more
openly
at
variance
with
each
other
than
before
were
stirring
up
the
soldiers
to
action
he
then
made
an
attempt
to
flee
and
intended
to
escape
to
some
point
by
being
placed
in
a
box
but
was
discovered
and
slain
having
reached
eighteen
years
of
age
his
mother
who
embraced
and
clung

i
was
able
in
each
case
but
of
the
rest
i
have
not
found
it
feasible
to
give

for
the
reason
that
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
sojourn
in

after
going
from

to
bithynia
i
fell
sick
and
from
there
i

to

on
returning
to

i
was
almost
immediately
sent
to
govern
in
dalmatia
and
from
there
into
upper
pannonia
after
that
i
came
back
to
rome
and
on
reaching
campania
at
once
set
out
for
home
sidenote
for
these
reasons
then
i
have
not
been
able
to
compile
an
account
of
what
follows
similar
to
that
which
precedes
i
will
narrate
briefly
however
all
the
things
that
were
done
up
to
the
time
of
my
second
consulship
ulpianus
corrected
many
of
the
irregular
practices
instituted
by
sardanapalus
but
after
putting
to
death
flavianus
and
chrestus
that
he
might
succeed
them
he
was
himself
before
long
slain
by
the
pretorians
who
attacked
him
in
the
night
and
it
availed
nothing
that
ran
to
the
palace
and
took
refuge
with
the
emperor
himself
and
the
latter
even
during
his
lifetime
a
great
dispute
had
arisen
between
the
populace
and
the
pretorians
from
some
small
cause
with
the
result
that
they
fought
each
other
for
three
days
and
many
were
lost
by
both
sides
the
soldiers
on
getting
the
worst
of
it
directed
their
efforts
to
firing
the
buildings
and
so
the
populace
fearing
that
the
whole
city
would
be
destroyed
reluctantly
came
to
terms
with
them
besides
these
occurrences
epagathus

with
punishment
from
there
he
was

being
a

from

she
also
brought
home
for
her

a

whom
she
would
not
allow
to
be
addressed
as
augusta
after
a
time
however
she
separated
her
from
her
son
and
drove
her
away
to
libya
in
spite
of
the
woman
possessing
his
affections
alexander
however
could
not
oppose
his
mother
for
she
ruled
him
absolutely
sidenote
many
uprisings
were
made
by
many
persons
some
of
which
caused
serious
alarm
but
they
were
all
checked
but
affairs
in
mesopotamia
were
still
more
terrifying
and
provoked
in
the
hearts
of
all
not
merely
the
men
of
rome
but
the
rest
of
mankind
a
fear
that
had
a
truer
foundation
artaxerxes
a
persian
having
conquered
the
parthians
in
three
battles
and
killed
their
king
artabanus
made
a
campaign
against
hatra
which
he
endeavored
to
take
as
a
base
for
attacking
the
romans
he
did
make
a
breach
in
the
wall
but
as
he
lost
a
number
of
soldiers
through
an
ambuscade
he
transferred
his
position
into
media
of
this
district
as
also
of
parthia
he
acquired
no
small
portion
partly
by
force
and
partly
by
intimidation
and
then
marched
against
armenia
here
he
suffered
a
reverse
at
the
hands
of
the
natives
some
medes
and
the
children
of
artabanus
and
either
fled
as
some
say
or
as
others
assert
retired
to
prepare
a
larger
expedition
sidenote
he
accordingly
became
a
source
of
fear
to
us
for
he
was
encamped
with
a
large
army
over
against
not
mesopotamia
only
but
syria
also
and
boasted
that
he
would
win
back
everything
that
the
ancient
persians
had
once
held
as
far
as
the
grecian
sea
it
was
he
said
his
rightful
inheritance
from
his
forefathers
he
was
of
no
particular
account
himself
but
our
military
affairs
are
in
such
a
condition
that
some
joined
his
cause
and
others
refused
to
defend
themselves
the
troops
are
so
distinguished
by
wantonness
and
arrogance
and
freedom
from
reproof
that
those
in
mesopotamia
dared
to
kill
their
commander
flavius
heracleo
and
the
pretorians
found
fault
with
me
before
ulpianus
because
i
ruled
the
soldiers
in
pannonia
with
a
strong
hand
and
they
demanded
my
surrender
through
fear
that
some
one
might
compel
them
to
submit
to
a
régime
similar
to
that
of
the
pannonian
troops
sidenote
alexander
however
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
promoted
me
in
various
ways
appointing
me
to
be
consul
for
the
second
time
as
his
colleague
and
taking
upon
himself
personally
the
responsibility
of
meeting
the
expenditures
of
my
office
as
the
malcontents
evinced
displeasure
at
this
he
became
afraid
that
they
might
kill
me
if
they
saw
me
in
the
insignia
of
my
office
and
he
bade
me
spend
the
period
of
my
consulship
in
italy
somewhere
outside
of
rome
later
accordingly
i
came
both
to
rome
and
to
campania
to
visit
him
after
spending
a
few
days
in
his
company
during
which
the
soldiers
saw
me
without
offering
to
do
me
any
harm
i
started
for
home
being
released
on
account
of
the
trouble
with
my
feet
consequently
i
expect
to
spend
all
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
my
own
country
as
the
divine
presence
revealed
to
me
most
clearly
at
the
time
i
was
in
bithynia
once
in
a
dream
there
i
thought
i
saw
myself
commanded
by
it
to

who

of

numitor
silvia

ilia
a
priestess
of

so
that
she
might
remain
a
virgin
he
stood
in
terror
of
an
oracle
which
foretold
his
death
at
the
hands
of
the
children
of
numitor
for
this
reason
he
had
killed
ægestes
and
made
the
other
a
priestess
of
vesta
that
she
might
continue
a
virgin
and
childless
but
she
while
drawing
water
in

grove
conceived
and
bore
romulus
and
remus
the
daughter
of
amulius
by
supplication
rescued
her
from

she
gave
to

a
shepherd
husband
of
laurentia
to
expose
in
the
vicinity
of
the

these
the
shepherd
wife
took
and
reared
up
for
it
happened
that
she
had
about
that
time
brought
forth
a
infant
when
romulus
and
remus
were
grown
they
kept
flocks
in
the
fields
of
amulius
but
as
they
killed
some
of
the
shepherds
of
their
grandfather
numitor
a
watch
was
set
for
them
remus
being
arrested
romulus
ran
and
told
faustulus
and
he
ran
to
narrate
everything
to

finally
numitor
recognized
them
to
be
his
own

children
they
with
the
assistance
of

persons
killed
amulius
and
after
bestowing
the

of

on
their

numitor
themselves
made
a
beginning
of
founding

in
the
eighteenth

of

prior

romulus
founded
on
the

another

of

had
been
founded
by
a
romulus

the

how
æneas

though
these

say

see
how
tell
the
story
æneas
received
an
oracle
to
found
the
city
on
the
spot
where
his
companions
should
devour
their
own
tables
now
when
they
came
to
italy
and
were
in
want
of
tables
they
used
loaves
instead
of
tables
finally
they
ate
also
the
tables
or
the
loaves
æneas
consequently
understanding
the
oracle
founded
there
the
lavinian
city

if
the
ignorant
do
say

else
should
have

secondly
because
he
shrank
from
publishing
matters
involving
his
own
wrongdoing
he
was
difficult
of
access

hard
to
accost

showed
such
great

giving
the
preference
to

as

this

love
for

was

still
it

her

of

could
not

he
attempted

he
devised

in

he
compelled
her
to
submit
voluntarily
to
be
debauched
to
his
declaration
that
he
would
cut

she
paid
no
attention

would

listened

the

and
spread
the
report
that
he
had

he
was

fearing

had
so
happened
chose
to
yield

lose

good

perishing
at

for

reason
she
did
not
refuse
to
commit

but
afterward
she
made

a

beneath
the
pillow
and
sent
for
her

her

as
soon

those
whose
money
gave
them
influence
desired
to
surpass
their
inferiors
in
all
respects
as
though
they
were
their
sovereigns
and
the
weaker
citizens
sure
of
their
own
equal
rights
were
unwilling
to
obey
them
even
in
some
small
point
the
one
class
insatiate
of
freedom
sought
to
enjoy
the
property
of
the
other
and
this
other
uncontrolled
in
its
pride
of
place
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
the
former
labors
so
it
was
that
they
sundered
their
former
relations
wherein
they
were
wont
harmoniously
to
assist
each
other
with
mutual
profit
and
no
longer
made
distinctions
between
foreign
and
native
races
indeed
both
disdained
moderation
and
the
one
class
set
its
heart
upon
an
extreme
of
dominion
the
other
upon
an
extreme
of
resistance
to
voluntary
servitude
consequently
they
missed
the
results
accomplished
by
their
previous
allied
efforts
and
inflicted
many
striking
injuries
partly
in
defence
against
each
other
movements
and
partly
by

of
anticipating
them

at

they

this
then
was
the
beginning
of
their
suffering
more
harm
from
each
other
than
from
outside
nations
and
the
complexion
of
their
difficulties
inspires
me
to
pronounce
that
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
be
deprived

their

the

the

through

grew
conscious

the

was

it

the
celebration
of
the
triumphal
festivities
which
they
called
was
of
somewhat
the
following
nature
when
any
great
success
worthy
of
a
triumph
had
been
gained
the
general
was
immediately
saluted
as
imperator
by
the
soldiers
and
he
would
bind
twigs
of
laurel
upon
the
rods
and
deliver
them
to
the
runners
to
carry
who
announced
the
victory
to
the
city
on
arriving
home
he
would
assemble
the
senate
and
ask
to
have
the
triumph
voted
him
and
if
he
obtained
a
vote
from
the
senate
and
from
the
people
his
title
of
imperator
was
confirmed
if
he
still
held
the
office
in
the
course
of
which
he
happened
to
be
victorious
he
continued
to
enjoy
it
while
celebrating
the
festival
but
if
the
term
of
his
office
had
expired
he
received
some
other
name
connected
with
it
since
it
was
forbidden
a
private
individual
to
hold
a
triumph
arrayed
in
the
triumphal
dress
he
took
armlets
and
with
a
laurel
crown
upon
his
head
and
holding
a
branch
in
his
right
hand
he
called
together
the
people
after
praising
his
comrades
of
the
campaign
he
presented
some
both
publicly
and
privately
with
money
he
honored
them
also
with
decorations
and
upon
some
he
bestowed
armlets
and
spears
without
the
iron
crowns
too
he
gave
to
some
of
gold
and
to
others
of
silver
bearing
the
name
of
each
man
and
the
representation
of
his
particular
feat
for
example
either
a
man
had
been
first
to
mount
a

and
the
crown
bore
the
figure
of
a
wall
or
he
had
captured
some
point
by
storm
and
a
likeness
of
that
particular
place
had
been
made
a
man
might
have
won
a
battle
at
sea
and
the
crown
had
been
adorned
with
ships
or
one
might
have
won
a
cavalry
fight
and
some
equestrian
figure
had
been
represented
he
who
had
rescued
a
citizen
from
battle
or
other
peril
or
from
a
siege
had
the
greatest
praise
and
would
receive
a
crown
fashioned
of
oak
which
was
esteemed
as
far
more
honorable
than
all
both
the
silver
and
the
gold
and
these
rewards
would
be
given
not
only
to
men

as
each
had
shown
his
prowess

were
also
bestowed

and
resolved
that
the
rest
of
the
world
should
be
dependent
on
him
and
not
he
upon
other
persons
in
fine
he
paid
attention
to
the
nature
of
things
rather
than
to
their
reputed
good
points
as
often
as
the
two
did
not
happen
to
coincide
he
also
however
prized
extravagantly
whatever
he
needed
slaves
most
of
them
he
esteemed
in
that
way
and
beheld
them
willing
to
encounter
danger
for
him
even
contrary
to
their
own
advantage
for
these
reasons
he
often
himself
refrained
from
opportunities
for
gain
and
other
most
delightful
pleasures
but
gave
a
share
ungrudgingly
to
them
hence
he
could
get
them
to
be
not
unwilling
partners
in
hard
work
he
subjected
himself
not
only
to
the
same
conditions
of
living
as
these
men
but
also
to
the
same
dangers
and
was
the
first
to
accomplish
every
task
that
he
demanded
of
them
likewise
he
was
confident
that
they
too
without
pretexts
and
with
zeal
since
he
showed
his
care
for
them
not
in
words
only
would
help
him
effect
his
projects
toward
the
rest
he
always
behaved
quite
proudly
and
the
whole
multitude
in
consequence
felt
either
or
fear
toward
him
because
of
their
similar
conditions
of
life
on
the
one
hand
and
because
of
his
haughtiness
on
the
other
accordingly
he
was
fully
able
to
bring
low
the
towering
head
to
exalt
humility
and
to
inspire
all
whom
he
pleased
in
the
shortest
period
one
with
hesitation
another
with
boldness
with
hope
also
and
despair
regarding
most
important
matters
and
that
this
information
about
him
is
not
false
but
is
truthful
tradition
his
works
are
proof
much
of
spain
he
won
over
in
a
short
time
and
from
there
carried
the
war
into
italy
through
the
country
of
the
gauls
most
of
whom
were
not
only
not
in

with
him

actually
unknown

was
the
first
of
so
far
as
we
know
to
cross
the
alps
with
an
army
and
after
that
he
made
a
campaign
against
rome
itself
sundering
from
it
almost
all
its
allies
some
by
force
and
others
by
persuasion
this
however
he
achieved
by
himself
without
the
aid
of
the
carthaginian
government
he
was
not
sent
forth
in
the
beginning
by
the
magistrates
at
home
nor
did
he
later
obtain
any
considerable
assistance
from
them
while
they
were
on
the
eve
of
enjoying
the
greatest
glory
and
benefit
through
his
efforts
they
wished
rather
not
to
appear
to
be
leaving

in

coöperate

harbored
no
wrath
against
either
the
citizens
or
rufus
he
excused
them
for
an
act
prompted
by
human
nature
and
was
for
contenting
himself
if
in
any
way
they
might
survive
he
desired
the
preservation
and
victory
of
the
commonwealth
rather
than
an
individual
reputation
and
continued
to
believe
that
excellence
depends
not
on
decrees
but
on
each
man
spirit
and
that
a
man
is
better
or
worse
not
as
a
result
of
any
ordinance
but
as
a
result
of
his
own
wisdom
or
ignorance
rufus
however
who
had
not
shown
the
right
spirit
in
the
first
place
was
now
more
than
ever
puffed
up
and
could
not
contain
himself
because
he
had
obtained
through
his
insubordination
the
further
prize
of
equal
authority
with
the
dictator
and
so
he
kept
asking
for
the
right
to
hold
sole
sway
a
day
at
a
time
or
for
several
days
alternately
but
fabius
in
the
fear
that
he
might
work
some
harm
if
he
should
get
possession
of
the
undivided
power
would
not
consent
to
either
plan
of
his
but
divided
the
army
in
such
a
way
that
they
each
like
the
consuls
had
a
separate
force
and
immediately
rufus
encamped
apart
in
order
that
he
might
give
a
practical
illustration
of
the
fact
that
he
held
sway
in
his
own
right
and
not
subject
to
the
dictator
valesius
zonaras
it
is
customary
for
men
who
are
ruled
to
concur
in
opinion
easily
especially
often
do
they
join
forces
when
the
object
is
to
slander
men
of
good
reputation
for
the
reason
that
it
is
their
nature
to
help
in
augmenting
any
power
just
come
to
light
but
to
bring
low
what
has
already
obtained
preëminence
and
though
one
can
not
immediately
measure
one
self
with
men
who
surpass
one
through
ampler
resources
growth
in

unexpected
quarter

of
a

footnote

obtained

attitude

somehow
those
who
are
not
completely
fools
and
voluntarily
gave
up
his
leadership
and
for
this
all
praised
him
loudly
he
was
not
held
worthy
of
censure
because
he
had
failed
to
recognize
at
first
what
was
fitting
but
was
commended
for
not
hesitating
to
change
his
mind
they
deemed
it
an
act
of
good
fortune
for
a
man
to
choose
right
at
the
start
a
proper
course
of
conduct
but
they
thoroughly
approved
the
course
of
one
who
having
learned
from
practical
experience
the
better
way
was
not
ashamed
to
face
squarely
about
from
this
episode
too
it
was
clearly
shown
how
much
one
man
differs
from
another
and
true
excellence
from
the
reputation
therefor
what
had
been
taken
from
fabius

jealousy

fully

stood
higher

estimation
than
a

successful
commander

expecting
that
if
they
followed
their
own
bent
they
would
probably
meet
with
failure
but
if
they
heeded
his
counsel
they
would
meet
with
a
favorable
outcome
he
preferred
to
look
to
the
second
contingency
for
praise
and
the
consuls
were
not
unduly
bold
but
acted
on
the
suggestion
of
fabius
deeming
it
better
not
to
accomplish
any
important
result

to

excelled

the

but
excelled
also
in
discovering
at
a
moment
notice
what
needed
to
be
done
and
knew
how
to
employ
either
method
on
the
proper
occasion
the
duties
that
lay
before
him
he
reviewed
boldly
but
accomplished
their
fulfillment
as
if
with
timidity
therefore
by
his
fearless
detailed
investigation
he
obtained
accurate
knowledge
of
the
fitting
action
in
every
emergency
and
by
his
good
judgment
in
doubtful
cases
met
these
emergencies
safely
consequently
if
he
was
ever
brought
face
to
face
with
some
need
that
admitted
of
no
deliberation
as
is
wont
to
happen
in
the
contradictions
of
warfare
and
the
turns
of
fortune
not
even
then
did
he
miss
the
proper
course
through
accustoming
himself
to
regard
no
happening
as
unreasonable
he
was
not
unprepared
for
the
assault
of
sudden
events
but
through
his
incessant
activity
was
able
to
meet
the
unexpected
as
if
he
had
forseen
it
long
before
as
a
result
he
showed
himself
daring
in
matters
where
he
felt
he
was
right
and
ready
to
run
risks
where
he
felt
bold
in
bodily
frame
he
was
strong
as
the
best
of
the
soldiers
this
led
to
one
of
his
most
remarkable
characteristics
he
would
devise
movements
that
looked
advantageous
as
if
he
were
merely
going
to
command
others
and
at
the
time
of
action
would
execute
them
as
if
they
had
been
ordered
by
others
besides
not
swerving
from
the
ordinary
paths
of
rectitude
he
kept
faith
scrupulously
not
only
with
the
citizens
and
his
acquaintances
but
with
foreign
and
most
hostile
nations
this
too
brought
many
individuals
as
well
as
many
cities
to
his
standard
he
never
spoke
or
acted
without
due
consideration
or
through
anger
or
fear
but
as
a
result
of
the
certainty
of
his
calculations
he
was
ready
for
all
chances
he
had
thought
out
practically
all
human
possibilities
he
never
did
anything
unexpected
but
deliberated
every
matter
beforehand
according
to
its
nature
thus
he
perceived
very
easily
the
right
course
to
follow
even
before
there
was
any
necessity
and
pursued
it
with
firmness
these
are
the
reasons
or
chiefly
these
i
should
mention
also
his
moderation
and
amiability
that
he
alone
of
men
escaped
the
envy
of
his
peers
or
of
any
one
else
he
chose
to
make
himself
like
to
his
inferiors
not
better
than
his
equals
weaker
than
greater
men
and
so
passed
beyond
the
power
of
jealousy
which
harasses

the
noblest
men
