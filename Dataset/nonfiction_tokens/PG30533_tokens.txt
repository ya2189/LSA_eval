introduction
the
supraspecific
categories
of
the
chipmunks
as
in
most
other
groups
of
squirrels
have
been
a
source
of
controversy
for
many
years
before
presenting
new
evidence
and
a
review
of
older
evidence
bearing
on
the
problem
it
seems
desirable
to
review
briefly
in
chronological
order
the
taxonomic
history
of
the
genera
and
subgenera
of
the
chipmunks
historical
linnaeus
described
the
eastern
north
american
chipmunks
under
the
name
and
based
his
description
on
that
of
catesby
the
asiatic
chipmunk
was
first
described
under
the
name
by
laxmann
schreber
separated
the
asiatic
and
north
american
chipmunks
into
the
asiatic
and
american
varieties
gmelin
followed
schreber
and
employing
trinomials
used
the
names
striatus
and
illiger
proposed
as
the
generic
name
of
the
chipmunk
of
eastern
north
america
say
described
the
first
species
of
chipmunk
known
from
western
north
america
trouessart
proposed
as
the
subgeneric
name
to
include
the
western
north
american
and
asiatic
chipmunks
merriam
raised
to
full
generic
rank
in
so
doing
he
neither
listed
nor
described
any
characters
but
wrote
that
it
will
be
observed
that
the
name
proposed
by
trouessart
in
as
a
subgenus
of
is
here
adopted
as
a
full
genus
this
is
because
of
the
conviction
that
the
superficial
resemblance
between
the
two
groups
is
accidental
parallelism
in
no
way
indicative
of
affinity
in
fact
the
two
groups
if
my
notion
of
their
relationship
is
correct
had
different
ancestors
being
an
offshoot
of
the
of
the
subgenus
of
allen
and
of
the
subgenus
merriam
howell
proposed
as
the
subgeneric
name
for
the
chipmunks
of
western
north
america
of
the
genus
ellerman
gave
and
equal
subgeneric
rank
with
under
the
genus
on
pages
he
quoted
merriam
as
i
have
done
above
and
later
after
quoting
the
key
to
the
genera
and
subgenera
of
chipmunks
of
howell
ellerman
wrote
this
key
convinces
me
that
all
these
forms
must
be
referred
to
one
genus
only
the
characters
given
to
separate
from
are
based
only
on
the
absence
or
presence
of
the
functionless
premolar
and
on
the
colour
pattern
if
colour
pattern
is
to
be
used
as
a
generic
character
it
seems
will
require
a
new
name
when
compared
with
etc
and
again
the
asiatic
chipmunk
is
intermediate
between
typical
and
the
small
american
forms
in
many
characters
to
substantiate
this
ellerman
quotes
howell
in
comparing
the
subgenera
and
as
follows
ears
of
subgenus
are
broad
rounded
of
medium
height
much
as
in
postorbital
broad
at
base
tapering
to
a
point
much
as
in
interorbital
constriction
slight
as
in
upper
molariform
tooth
rows
slightly
convergent
posteriorly
as
in
ellerman
again
quotes
howell
of
asia
resembles
of
north
america
and
differs
from
american
in
a
number
of
characters
notably
the
shape
of
the
anteorbital
foramen
the
postorbital
process
the
breadth
of
the
interorbital
region
the
development
of
the
lambdoidal
crest
and
the
shape
of
the
external
ears
on
the
other
hand
american
agrees
with
the
asiatic
members
of
the
genus
in
the
shape
of
the
rostrum
the
striations
of
the
upper
incisors
the
presence
of
the
extra
premolar
and
in
the
pattern
of
the
dorsal
stripes
bryant
wrote
i
am
convinced
that
ellerman
interpretation
of
the
relationships
of
the
chipmunks
is
correct
after
commenting
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
is
of
significance
only
in
distinguishing
between
species
of
squirrels
bryant
adds
that
the
other
differences
between
the
eastern
and
the
western
chipmunks
do
not
appear
to
be
of
sufficient
phylogenetic
importance
to
warrant
the
retention
of
the
two
groups
as
genera
methods

characters
previously
mentioned
in
the
literature
as
having
taxonomic
worth
for
supraspecific
categories
of
chipmunks
were
checked
by
me
on
specimens
old
enough
to
have
worn
permanent
premolars
some
structural
features
not
previously
used
were
found
to
have
taxonomic
significance
the
baculum
in
each
of
the
supraspecific
categories
of
sciurids
of
north
america
was
examined
the
bacula
were
processed
by
the
method
described
by
white
to
obviate
variation
caused
by
shriveling
of
the
smaller
bacula
or
breaking
of
the
more
delicate
parts
of
the
larger
bacula
mallei
and
hyoid
bones
of
the
genera
and
subgenera
of
the
chipmunks
were
mostly
studied
in
the
dry

part
of
the
hyoid
musculature
in
these

was
dissected
in

treat
the

such
additional
characters
as
i
have
found
useful
in
characterizing
the
genera

some
of
the
findings
i
think
illustrate
how
study
of
such
mammalian

that
seem
to
be
little

the
changing

if
these
previously
were
estimated
only
from
other
parts
of
the
anatomy
of
recent

the
structural
features
and
characters
to
be
discussed
or
listed
below
may
be
arranged
in
three
categories
as

of
the
in
discussing
the
baculum
in
and
it
seems
desirable
to
do
so
in
the
light
of
the
structure
of
the
baculum
in
other
sciurids
the
bacula
of
north
american
sciurids
are
divisible
into
six
distinct
types
represented
by
those
of
the
genera
and
the
type
of
baculum
in
is
spoonshaped
with
a
ventral
process
that
is
spinelike
or
keellike
also
spines
usually
are
present
along
the
margin
of
the
spoon
the
base
proximal
end
of
the
baculum
is
broad
and
some
species
have
a
winglike
process
extending
dorsally
and
partly
covering
a
longitudinal
groove
the
shaft
is
more
or
less
curved
downward
in
the
middle
see
figs
in
the
baculum
is
greatly
enlarged
at
the
posterior
end
and
forms
a
shieldlike
surface
the
ventral
surface
of
the
base
is
flattened
and
the
ventral
surface
of
the
shaft
curves
slightly
ventrally
then
dorsally
to
the
tip
the
dorsal
region
of
the
base
culminates
in
a
point
from
which
there
is
a
ridge
that
extends
anteriorly
and
that
tapers
rapidly
into
the
shaft
near
the
tip
the
tip
dorsally
has
a
slight
depression
surrounded
by
knobs
which
are
more
or
less
well
defined
and
which
resemble
topographically
the
spines
described
for
see
fig
in
the
baculum
is
semispoonshaped
and
asymmetrical
there
is
a
winglike
process
on
one
side
and
a
spine
which
projects
lateroventrally
on
the
other
side
of
the
tip
the
base
of
the
baculum
is
broad
but
not
so
broad
as
in
most
species
of
extending
posteriorly
from
the
region
of
the
tip
at
which
point
a
spine
projects
lateroventrally
there
is
a
ridge
which
is
often
partly
ossified
and
that
extends
to
a
point
near
the
base
see
fig
in
the
baculum
is
absent
or
vestigial
layne
in
the
baculum
is
broad
at
the
base
and
the
shaft
tapers
distally
to
the
junction
of
the
shaft
and
tip
or
the
base
is
only
slightly
wider
than
any
part
of
the
shaft
the
tip
often
forms
an
abrupt
angle
with
the
shaft
and
there
is
a
keel
on
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
tip
see
figs
the
baculum
in
is
the
most
distinctive
of
that
of
any
american
sciurid
according
to
pocock
the
baculum
of
is
exceedingly
long
and
slender
slightly
sinuous
in
its
proximal
third
and
inclined
slightly
upwards
distally
the
extreme
apex
is
bifid
the
lower
process
being
rounded
the
upper
more
pointed
on
the
left
side
there
is
a
long
crest
running
from
the
summit
of
the
upper
terminal
process
and
ending
abruptly
behind
the
left
side
about
of
the
distance
from
the
proximal
end
of
the
bone
it
lies
over
a
groove
and
there
is
a
second
shallower
groove
on
the
right
side
of
the
bone
the
baculum
of
is
markedly
wider
more
flattened
and
shorter
than
in
the
crest
which
is
also
present
in
starts
from
the
upper
terminal
process
and
extends
to
the
base
of
the
baculum
on

left
side
there
is
a
knoblike
process
on
the
crest
at
a
point

baculum
from
its
base
the

american
sciurids
can
be
classified
into
six
structural
groups

rarely

suggesting
that

functional
in
older
chipmunks
in

normally

in

lacks
a

of

directly
to

the
projection

ellerman
and
bryant
think
that
the
presence

of
is
not
of
generic
significance
in
chipmunks
since
is
vestigial
and
probably
is
in
the
process
of
being
lost
and
since
this
character
is
rarely
used
as
a
generic
character
in
other
sciurids
i
think
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
together
with
the
projection
of
the
anterior
root
of
in
relation
to
the
masseteric
knob
is
of
generic
significance
for
squirrels
in
general
have
retained
the
dentition
and
dental
formula
of
a
primitive
rodent
and
any
change
in
the
pattern
of
the
teeth
or
in
dental
formula
is
in
my
opinion
of
a
fundamental
nature
of
tail
in
relation
to
total
the
tail
in
is
more
than
per
cent
of
the
total
length
whereas
in
the
tail
is
less
than
per
cent
of
the
total
length
in
this
respect
resembles
most
ground
squirrels
of
the
genus
the
chipmunks
vary
but
little
in
color
pattern
for
even
in
which
is
one
of
the
most
aberrant
of
the
chipmunks
in
color
pattern
the
pattern
is
characteristic
of
the
width
of
the
longitudinal
stripes
is
uniform
in
whereas
in
the
dorsal
longitudinal
light
stripes
are
more
than
twice
as
wide
as
the
other
stripes
in
only
the
two
lateralmost
dark
stripes
are
short
whereas
in
all
four
of
the
lateral
dark
stripes
are
short
none
extends
to
the
rump
or
to
the
shoulder
the
dark
median
stripe
is
present
in
both
and
as
well
as
in
other
genera
such
as
and
ellerman
characters
in
which
the
subgenus
eutamias
and
the
genus
tamias
agree
but
differ
from
the
subgenus
neotamias
of
the
infraorbital
in
the
subgenus
and
in
the
genus
the
infraorbital
foramen
is
rounded
whereas
in
most
species
of
the
subgenus
the
foramen
is
slitlike
in
however
the
infraorbital
foramen
is
rounded
as
much
as
in
the
subgenus
and
in
the
genus
of
the
postorbital
process
at
the
postorbital
process
is
broader
at
the
base
in
the
subgenus
and
in
the
genus
than
in
most
species
of
the
subgenus
in
however
this
process
is
relatively
as
broad
as
in
the
subgenus
and
in
the
genus
of
the
supraorbital
notch
in
relation
to
the
posterior
notch
of
the
zygomatic

the
subgenus
and
in
the
genus
the
supraorbital
notch
is
distinctly
anterior
to
the
posterior
notch
of
the
zygomatic
plate
whereas
in
the
subgenus
the
supraorbital
notch
is
only
slightly
anterior
to
the
posterior
notch
of
the
zygomatic
plate
this
difference
may
be
correlated
with
differences
in
size
since
specimens
of
the
subgenus
and
the
genus
are
larger
than
specimens
of
the

of

the

the

are
nearly

in
most

of

the

of

in

of
the

however
the
degree
of

of
the

is
approximately
the

as
in
the

and
the

structural
features
that
are
too
weakly
expressed
to
be
of
taxonomic
use
the
following
alleged
characters
have
been
mentioned
in
the
literature
since
the
degree
of
expression
of
these
features
is
so
slight
or
since
there
is
marked
variation
within
one
or
more
natural
groups
of
chipmunks
no
reliance
is
here
placed
on
these
features
they
are
as
follows

a
variation
that
does
not

fall
in
any
one
of
the
three
categories
mentioned
above
is
the
degree
of
development
of
the
lambdoidal

the
crest
is
least
developed
in
the
subgenus
and
most
developed
in
the
genus
the
larger
the
skull
the
more
the
lambdoidal
crest
is
developed
seemingly
therefore
the
degree
of
development
is
an
expression
of
size
of
the
skull
and
may
be
determined
by
heterogonic
growth
discussion
as
shown
in

there
are

discussion
chipmunks
are
small
striped
squirrels
that
inhabit
the
holarctic
realm
and
that
are
found
in
similar
niches
in
each
of
the
three
regions
palearctic
western
nearctic
and
eastern
nearctic
ellerman
and
bryant
placed
the
chipmunks
in
three
subgenera
corresponding
to
the
regions
mentioned
above
under
the
one
genus
critical
examination
of
new
and
old
evidence
reveals
nevertheless
that
the
subgenera
and
of
the
genus
are
more
closely
related
to
one
another
than
either
is
to
the
genus
this
relationship
can
be
seen
clearly
in
the
structure
of
the
malleus
baculum
hyoid
apparatus
hyoid
musculature
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
projection
of
the
anterior
root
of
in
relation
to
the
masseteric
knob
and
in
the
color
pattern
because
the
genera
and
occupy
similar
ecological
niches
the
structural
similarities
that
permit
these
animals
to
be
called
chipmunks
show
convergence
and
thus
can
be
assumed
to
be
adaptive
these
similarities
are
in
the
molars
in
shape
of
the
skull
in
color
pattern
and
in
other
features
which
have
been
used
by
many
systematists
to
interpret
the
phylogenetic
relationships
of
the
squirrels
pocock
however
reviewed
the
taxonomic
literature
on
sciurids
and
wrote
the
conclusion
very
forcibly
suggested
by
the
literature
of
the
subject
is
the
untrustworthiness
of
such
characters
pocock
correctly
in
my
opinion
then
established
a
supraspecific
classification
of
the
sciurids
based
almost
exclusively
on
the
structure
of
the
baculum
and
glans
penis
i
have
studied
the
baculum
in
chipmunks
and
in
all
the
major
supraspecific
groups
of
nearctic
squirrels
the
bacula
of
the
nearctic
squirrels
and
those
of
the
palearctic
and
indian
squirrels
other
than
the
chipmunks
are
described
and
figured
by
pocock
the
baculum
in
in

plan
of
structure
resembles
the
baculum
in
the
genera
and
of
the

callosciurini
simpson
the
baculum
in
in
general
plan
of
structure
resembles
that
in
and
of
the
tribe
marmotini
simpson
these
tribes
designated
by
simpson
are
based
on
the
corresponding
subfamilies
defined
by
pocock
primarily
on
differences
in
the
structure
of
the
baculum
i
assign
to
the
tribe
marmotini
i
assign
to
the
tribe
callosciurini
but
do
so
only
tentatively
because
i
have
not
at
first
hand
studied
the
bacula
of
most
of
the
callosciurini
the
fossil
record
is
too
incomplete
to
reveal
the
time
when
the
two
tribes
diverged
the
subgenera
and
are
closely
related
indications
are
that
the
divergence
of
the
two
subgenera
occurred
geologically
but
a
short
time
ago
possibly
in
pleistocene
time
conclusions
and
are
distinct

the

are
valid
for
differs

all
the
