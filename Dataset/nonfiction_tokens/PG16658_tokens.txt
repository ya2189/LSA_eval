preface
to
the
first
edition
i
here
present
to
the
musical
public
a
book
written
in
a
style
of
my
own
not
a
scientific
and
systematically
treatise
this
no
reasonable
man
would
expect
of
an
old
who
in
his
long
practice
in
the
realm
of
tones
could
not
arrive
at
learned
and
too
often
fruitless
deductions
nature
made
me
susceptible
to
that
which
is
good
and
beautiful
a
correct
instinct
and
a
tolerable
understanding
have
taught
me
to
avoid
the
false
and
the
vicious
a
desire
for
increased
knowledge
has
led
me
to
observe
carefully
whatever
i
met
with
in
my
path
in
life
and
i
may
say
without
hesitation
that
i
have
endeavored
according
to
my
ability
to
fill
the
position
to
which
i
have
been
called
this
is
no
vain
boast
but
only
the
justifiable
assertion
of
a
good
conscience
and
this
no
man
needs
to
withhold
for
these
reasons
i
have
been
unwilling
to
refrain
from
giving
to
the
world
a
true
expression
of
my
opinions
and
feelings
i
trust
they
will
meet
with
a
few
sympathizing
spirits
who
are
willing
to
understand
my
aims
but
i
shall
be
still
more
happy
if
here
and
there
a
will
adopt
the
views
here
set
forth
at
the
same
time
carefully
and
thoughtfully
supplying
many
things
which
it
did
not
enter
into
my
plan
to
explain
more
in
detail
abundant
material
lay
spread
out
before
me
and
even
increased
upon
my
hands
while
i
was
writing
art
is
indeed
so
comprehensive
and
every
thing
in
life
is
so
closely
connected
with
it
that
whoever
loves
and
fosters
it
will
daily
find
in
it
new
sources
of
enjoyment
and
new
incitements
to
study
the
most
experienced
teacher
of
art
must
be
a
constant
learner
i
have
always
held
and
still
hold
the
opinions
advanced
in
this
work
and
i
have
neglected
no
opportunity
to
impress
them
upon
my
pupils
i
may
be
allowed
to
mention
here
with
some
satisfaction
my
daughters
clara
and
marie
and
among
numerous
other
pupils
i
speak
with
equal
pleasure
of
the
estimable
herr
waldemar
heller
of
dresden
and
wenzel
of
leipzig
i
have
always
enjoyed
their
affection
and
gratitude
and
i
feel
a
pride
that
they
continue
to
defend
and
to
teach
the
principles
which
they
have
received
from
me
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
appeared
as
an
author
the
signale
für
die
musikalische
welt
as
well
as
the
neue
zeitschrift
für
musik
have
published
numerous
essays
from
my
pen
under
various
titles
the
approval
which
they
met
with
at
the
time
of
their
appearance
has
induced
me
to
undertake
this
larger
work
several
of
those
earlier
writings
are
included
in
this
book
but
in
a
partially
altered
form
the
frequently
recurring
character
the
teacher
dominie
originated
with
these
essays
i
need
hardly
say
that
he
represents
my
humble
self
those
who
are
otherwise
unacquainted
with
me
will
through
him
understand
my
character
and
will
moreover
see
that
a
man
of
such
caustic
brevity
can
be
by
no
means
a
master
of
polished
style
may
this
last
acknowledgment
appease
all
those
critics
whose
hair
is
made
to
stand
on
end
by
my
inelegant
mode
of
writing
i
will
make
no
further
apology
for
my
style
i
have
often
availed
myself
of
the
dialogue
form
because
it
was
conducive
to
brevity
not
less
frequently
i
have
made
use
of
the
form
of
the
epistle
and
of
personal
discourse
as
being
more
congenial
to
my
individual
manner
than
that
of
a
serious
treatise
i
have
also
undertaken
to
say
something
about
singing
a
if
he
is
possessed
of
mind
and
talent
as
i
suppose
him
to
be
whether
he
teaches
the
elements
or
occupies
himself
with
more
advanced
instruction
should
understand
the
art
of
singing
he
at
least
should
show
a
warm
interest
in
it
and
should
have
an
earnest
love
for
it
when
i
speak
in
general
of
singing
i
refer
to
that
species
of
singing
which
is
a
form
of
beauty
and
which
is
the
foundation
for
the
most
refined
and
most
perfect
interpretation
of
music
and
above
all
things
i
consider
the
culture
of
beautiful
tones
the
basis
for
the
finest
possible
touch
upon
the
piano
in
many
respects
the
piano
and
singing
should
explain
and
supplement
each
other
they
should
mutually
assist
in
expressing
the
sublime
and
the
noble
in
forms
of
unclouded
beauty
my
book
will
make
this
evident
to
many
but
whether
it
will
succeed
with
all
i
doubt
not
a
few
will
even
be
found
who
will
lay
aside
my
book
with
contempt
and
who
will
scorn
the
zeal
of
the
man
of
the
past
age
i
am
quite
prepared
for
this
it
is
the
fashion
at
present
to
undervalue
the
old
times
and
their
defenders
but
i
shall
continue
to
be
conservative
until
the
men
of
the
future
shall
be
able
to
show
me
results
which
shall
excel
those
of
the
past
or
at
least
shall
equal
them
and
now
i
commend
my
little
book
to
the
public
trusting
that
it
will
instruct
the
willing
correct
the
erring
incite
the
indolent
and
chastise

chapter

on
elementary

you
ask
my
dear
friend
for
some
particular
information
about
my
piano
method
especially
with
regard
to
my
mode
of
elementary
instruction
which
differs
essentially
from
that
in
common
use
i
give
you
here
the
main
points
and
if
you
place
confidence
in
my
experience
of
forty
years
and
if
you
will
supply
those
details
which
i
have
omitted
your
own
varied
experience
as
a
thoughtful
talented
and
earnest
will
enable
you
to
understand
my
theory
from
the
following
dialogue
between
my
humble
self
under
the
title
of
dominie
my
friend
and
the
little
bessie
dominie
my
dear
friend
how
have
you
managed
to
make
so
utterly
distasteful
to
little
susie
and
how
is
it
that
the
instruction
which
you
have
given
her
for
the
last
three
years
actually
amounts
to
nothing
friend
well
i
will
tell
you
how
i
have
proceeded
first
i
taught
her
the
names
of
the
keys
that
was
pretty
dull
work
for
her
then
i
made
her
learn
the
treble
notes
which
was
a
difficult
matter
after
that
i
taught
her
the
bass
notes
which
puzzled
her
still
more
then
i
undertook
to
teach
her
a
pretty
little
piece
which
she
hoped
to
perform
for
the
delight
of
her
parents
of
course
she
constantly
confused
the
bass
and
treble
notes
she
could
not
keep
time
she
always
used
the
wrong
fingers
and
could
not
learn
it
at
all
then
i
scolded
her
she
only
cried
i
tried
a
little
coaxing
that
made
her
cry
worse
finally
i
put
an
end
to
the
piano
lessons
and
she
begged
me
never
to
begin
them
again
and
there
you
have
the
whole
story
dominie
you
certainly
might
have
begun
more
judiciously
how
is
it
possible
for
a
child
to
climb
a
ladder
when
not
only
the
lower
rounds
but
a
great
many
more
are
wanting
nature
makes
no
leaps
least
of
all
with
children
friend
but
did
she
not
begin
to
climb
the
ladder
at
the
bottom
dominie
by
no
means
she
certainly
never
was
able
to
reach
the
top
i
should
say
rather
that
she
tumbled
down
head
foremost
to
speak
mildly
she
began
to
climb
in
the
middle
and
even
then
you
tried
to
chase
her
up
instead
of
allowing
her
carefully
and
quietly
to
clamber
up
one
step
at
a
time
bring
me
your
youngest
daughter
bessie
and
i
will
show
you
how
i
give
a
first
lesson
dominie
bessie
can
you
say
your
letters
after
me
so
bessie
dominie
go
on
bessie
dominie
once
more
the
first
four
again
then
the
next
four
right
now
all
the
eight
one
after
the
other
bessie
dominie
repeating
this
several
that
good
now
you
see
you
have
learned
something
already
that
is
the
musical
alphabet
and
those
are
the
names
of
the
white
keys
on
the
presently
you
shall
find
them
out
and
learn
to
name
them
yourself
but
first
you
must
take
notice
i
strike
the
keys
in
succession
with
my
finger
from
the
to
the
highest
treble
that
these
sounds
grow
higher
and
become
sharper
one
after
the
other
and
in
this
way
i
strike
the
keys
from
to
the
lowest
bass
you
hear
that
the
sounds
grow
lower
and
heavier
the
upper
half
to
the
right
is
called
the
treble
the
lower
half
is
the
bass
you
quite
understand
now
the
difference
between
the
high
sharp
tones
and
the
low
deep
ones
now
we
will
go
on
what
you
see
here
and
will
learn
to
play
upon
is
called
the
consisting
of
white
keys
and
black
ones
you
shall
presently
learn
to
give
the
right
names
both
to
the
white
keys
and
the
black
you
see
there
are
always
two
black
keys
and
then
three
black
keys
together
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
now
put
the
of
your
right
hand
on
the
lower
one
of
any
of
the
two
black
keys
that
are
together
and
let
it
slip
off
on
to
the
white
key
next
below
it
now
you
have
found
the
key
called
what
is
the
name
of
the
next
key
above
it
say
the
whole
musical
alphabet
bessie
dominie
well
then
that
key
is
called
bessie
then
this
one
must
be
dominie
and
now
comes
anywhere
on
the
you
can
find
just
as
easily
if
you
put
your
finger
on
the
lowest
of
any
three
black
keys
that
are
together
and
let
it
slip
off
on
to
the
white
key
next
below
it
if
you
remember
where
these
two
keys
and
are
both
in
the
treble
and
the
bass
you
can
easily
find
the
names
of
all
the
other
keys
now
what
is
the
next
key
above
bessie
and
then
dominie
now
we
will
say
over
several
times
the
names
of
the
keys
upwards
and
downwards
and
learn
to
find
them
skipping
about
in
any
irregular
order
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
we
will
try
them
over
once
more
and
before
the
next
lesson
you
will
know
the
names
of
all
the
white
keys
you
must
practise
finding
them
out
by
yourself
you
make
a
mistake
if
you
are
careful
to
remember
where
the
and
the
are
i
told
you
that
the
sounds
this
way
i
strike
the
keys
upward
grow
higher
and
this
way
i
strike
them
downwards
they
grow
lower
so
you
see
no
tones
are
just
alike
one
is
either
higher
or
lower
than
the
other
do
you
hear
the
difference
now
turn
round
so
as
not
to
see
the
keys
i
will
strike
two
keys
one
after
the
other
now
which
is
the
highest
the
sharpest
the
first
or
the
second
i
go
on
in
this
way
gradually
touching
keys
nearer
and
nearer
together
sometimes
in
order
to
puzzle
her
and
to
excite
close
attention
i
strike
the
lower
one
gently
and
the
higher
one
stronger
and
keep
on
sounding
them
lower
and
lower
towards
the
bass
according
to
the
capacity
of
the
pupil
i
suppose
you
find
it
a
little
tiresome
to
listen
so
closely
but
a
delicate
quick
ear
is
necessary
for
and
by
and
by
it
will
become
easier
to
you
but
i
wo
tire
you
with
it
any
more
now
we
will
go
on
to
something
else
can
you
count
bessie
yes
indeed
and
more
too
dominie
we
see
now
keep
counting
as
evenly
and
regularly
as
you
can
i
lead
her
to
count
steadily
and
strike
at
the
same
time
a
chord
in
three
even
now
we
see
if
you
can
count
evenly
by
yourself
i
count
of
the
chord
with
her
and
leave
her
to
count
and
by
herself
or
else
i
count
with
her
at
and
let
her
count
and
alone
but
i
am
careful
to
strike
the
chord
promptly
and
with
precision
afterwards
i
strike
the
chord
in
and
let
her
count
in
short
i
give
the
chord
in
various
ways
in
order
to
teach
her
steadiness
in
counting
and
to
confine
her
attention
in
the
same
way
i
teach
her
to
count
or
at
the
same
time
telling
her
that
music
is
sometimes
counted
in
triple
time
and
sometimes
in
or
time
now
bessie
you
have
learned
to
count
very
well
and
to
know
the
difference
in
the
tones
it
is
not
every
child
that
learns
this
in
the
first
lesson
if
you
do
get
tired
of
it
you
will
some
time
learn
to
be
a
good
player
as
soon
as
you
are
rested
i
will
tell
you
about
something
else
that
you
will
have
to
listen
to
very
carefully
bessie
but
i
like
it
and
will
take
pains
to
listen
just
as
closely
as
i
can
dominie
when
several
tones
are
struck
at
the
same
time
if
they
sound
well
together
they
make
what
we
call
a
chord
but
there
are
both
major
and
minor
chords
the
major
chord
sounds
joyous
gay
the
minor
sad
dull
as
you
would
say
the
former
laugh
the
latter
weep
now
take
notice
whether
i
am
right
i
strike
the
chord
of
c
major
then
after
a
short
pause
that
of
c
minor
and
try
by
a
stronger
or
lighter
touch
to
make
her
listen
first
to
the
major
and
then
to
the
minor
chords
she
usually
distinguishes
correctly
but
it
will
not
do
to
dwell
too
long
upon
these
at
first
or
to
try
to
enforce
any
thing
by
too
much
talk
and
explanation
now
i
will
tell
you
that
the
difference
in
the
sounds
of
these
chords
is
in
the
third
counted
upwards
from
the
lower
note
and
depends
upon
whether
you
take
it
half
a
tone
higher
or
lower
or
flat
i
shall
explain
this
better
to
you
by
and
by
when
you
come
to
learn
about
the
tonic
the
third
the
fifth
or
dominant
the
octave
and
so
on
it
is
advantageous
and
psychologically
correct
to
touch
occasionally
in
passing
upon
points
which
will
be
more
thoroughly
taught
later
it
excites
the
interest
of
the
pupil
thus
the
customary
technical
terms
are
sometimes
made
use
of
beforehand
and
a
needful
cursory
explanation
given
of
them
that
is
right
you
can
tell
them
pretty
well
already
now
we
will
repeat
once
more
the
names
of
the
keys
and
then
we
will
stop
for
just
see
how
many
things
you
have
learned
in
this
lesson
bessie
it
was
beautiful
dominie
i
hope
you
will
always
find
it
so
bessie
when
may
i
have
another
lesson
dominie
day
after
at
first
you
must
have
at
least
three
lessons
a
week
bessie
what
shall
i
do
in
the
next
lesson
dominie
i
shall
repeat
all
that
i
have
taught
you
but
i
shall
teach
you
a
great
deal
of
it
in
a
different
way
and
every
time
i
shall
teach
it
to
you
differently
so
that
it
shall
always
be
interesting
to
you
in
the
next
lesson
we
will
begin
to
play
first
on
the
table
and
at
last
on
the
piano
you
will
learn
to
move
your
fingers
lightly
and
loosely
and
quite
independently
of
the
arm
though
at
first
they
will
be
weak
and
you
will
learn
to
raise
them
and
let
them
fall
properly
besides
that
we
will
contrive
a
few
exercises
to
teach
you
to
make
the
wrist
loose
for
that
must
be
learned
in
the
beginning
in
order
to
acquire
a
fine
touch
on
the
piano
that
is
to
make
the
tones
sound
as
beautiful
as
possible
i
shall
show
you
how
to
sit
at
the
piano
and
how
to
hold
your
hands
you
will
learn
the
names
of
the
black
keys
and
the
scale
of
c
with
the
from
the
to
the
and
also
that
from
the
to
the
which
latter
is
called
the
leading
note
which
leads
into
this
is
quite
important
for
my
method
for
in
this
way
the
different
keys
can
be
clearly
explained
you
will
learn
to
find
the
chord
of
c
in
the
bass
and
the
treble
and
to
strike
them
with
both
hands
together
and
then
in
the
third
or
fourth
lesson
after
you
know
quite
perfectly
all
that
i
have
already
taught
you
i
will
teach
you
to
play
a
little
piece
that
will
please
you
and
then
you
will
really
be
a
player
a
pianist
friend
from
whom
have
you
learned
all
this
it
goes
like
the
dominie
a
great
many
people
can
learn
is
to
be
taught
but
it
is
to
be
taught
i
have
only
found
out
by
devoting
my
whole
mind
with
real
love
and
constant
thought
to
the
musical
improvement
and
general
mental
development
of
my
pupils
the
advancement
will
unquestionably
be
rapid
for
it
proceeds
step
by
step
and
one
thing
is
founded
upon
another
the
pupil
learns
every
thing
quietly
thoughtfully
and
surely
without
going
roundabout
without
any
hindrances
and
mistakes
to
be
unlearned
i
never
try
to
teach
too
much
or
too
little
and
in
teaching
each
thing
i
try
to
prepare
and
lay
the
foundation
for
other
things
to
be
afterwards
learned
i
consider
it
very
important
not
to
try
to
cram
the
child
memory
with
the
wisdom
as
is
often
done
in
a
crude
and
harsh
way
but
i
endeavor
to
excite
the
pupil
mind
to
interest
it
and
to
let
it
develop
itself
and
not
to
degrade
it
to
a
mere
machine
i
do
not
require
the
practice
of
a
vague
dreary
time
and
mind
killing
in
which
way
as
i
see
your
little
susie
was
obliged
to
learn
but
i
observe
a
musical
method
and
in
doing
this
always
keep
strictly
in
view
the
individuality
and
gradual
development
of
the
pupil
in
more
advanced
instruction
i
even
take
an
interest
in
the
general
culture
and
disposition
of
the
pupil
and
improve
every
opportunity
to
call
forth
the
sense
of
beauty
and
continually
to
aid
in
the
intellectual
development
friend
but
where
are
the
notes
all
this
time
dominie
before
that
we
have
a
great
deal
to
do
that
is
interesting
and
agreeable
i
keep
constantly
in
view
the
formation
of
a
good
technique
but
i
do
not
make
distasteful
to
the
pupil
by
urging
her
to
a
useless
and
senseless
mechanical
practising
i
may
perhaps
teach
the
treble
notes
after
the
first
six
months
or
after
sixty
or
eighty
lessons
but
i
teach
them
in
my
own
peculiar
way
so
that
the
mind
may
be
kept
constantly
active
with
my
own
daughters
i
did
not
teach
the
treble
notes
till
the
end
of
the
first
year
instruction
the
bass
notes
several
months
later
friend
but
what
did
you
do
meanwhile
dominie
you
really
ought
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
for
yourself
after
hearing
this
lesson
and
what
i
have
said
about
it
i
have
cultivated
a
musical
taste
in
my
pupils
and
almost
taught
them
to
be
skilful
good
players
without
knowing
a
note
i
have
taught
a
correct
light
touch
of
the
keys
from
the
fingers
and
of
whole
chords
from
the
wrist
to
this
i
have
added
the
scales
in
all
the
keys
but
these
should
not
be
taught
at
first
with
both
hands
together
the
pupil
may
gradually
acquire
the
habit
of
practising
them
together
later
but
it
is
not
desirable
to
insist
on
this
too
early
for
in
playing
the
scales
with
both
hands
together
the
weakness
of
the
fourth
finger
is
concealed
and
the
attention
distracted
from
the
feeble
tones
and
the
result
is
an
unequal
and
poor
scale
at
the
same
time
i
have
in
every
way
cultivated
the
sense
of
time
and
taught
the
division
of
the
bars
i
have
helped
the
pupils
to
invent
little
cadences
with
the
dominant
and
and
even
little
exercises
to
their
great
delight
and
advantage
and
i
have
of
course
at
the
same
time
insisted
on
the
use
of
the
correct
fingering
you
see
that
in
order
to
become
practical
i
begin
with
the
theory
so
for
instance
i
teach
the
pupil
to
find
the
triad
and
the
dominant
chord
of
the
seventh
with
their
transpositions
in
every
key
and
to
practise
them
diligently
and
to
make
use
of
these
chords
in
all
sorts
of
new
figures
and
passages
but
all
this
must
be
done
without
haste
and
without
tiring
the
pupil
too
much
with
one
thing
or
wearing
out
the
interest
which
is
after
that
i
teach
them
to
play
fifty
or
sixty
little
pieces
which
i
have
written
for
this
purpose
they
are
short
rhythmically
balanced
agreeable
and
striking
to
the
ear
and
aim
to
develop
gradually
an
increased
mechanical
skill
i
require
them
to
be
learned
by
heart
and
often
to
be
transposed
into
other
keys
in
which
way
the
memory
which
is
indispensable
for
piano
playing
is
unconsciously
greatly
increased
they
must
be
learned
and
played
well
often
according
to
the
capacity
of
the
pupil
even
finely
in
strict
time
counting
aloud
is
seldom
necessary
and
without
stumbling
or
hesitating
first
slowly
then
fast
faster
slow
again
this
mode
of
instruction
i
find
always
successful
but
i
do
not
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
without
previous
technical
instruction
begin
my
piano
lessons
with
the
extremely
difficult
acquirement
of
the
treble
and
bass
notes
in
a
word
i
have
striven
as
a
psychologist
and
thinker
as
a
man
and
teacher
for
a
culture
i
have
also
paid
great
attention
to
the
art
of
singing
as
a
necessary
foundation
for
i
have
devoted
some
talent
and
at
least
an
enthusiastic
unwearied
love
to
the
subject
i
have
never
stood
still
have
learned
something
of
teaching
every
day
and
have
sought
always
to
improve
myself
i
have
always
been
something
new
and
different
in
every
lesson
and
with
every
child
i
have
always
kept
up
a
cheerful
joyous
courage
and
this
has
usually
kindled
the
same
in
my
pupil
because
it
came
from
the
heart
moreover
i
have
never
been
a
man
of
routine
have
never
shown
myself
a
pedant
who
is
obliged
to
hold
fast
to
certain
ideas
and
views
i
have
lived
up
to
the
century
and
have
tried
to
understand
and
to
advance
the
age
have
heard
every
thing
great
and
fine
in
music
and
have
induced
my
pupils
also
to
hear
it
i
have
opposed
with
determination
all
the
prejudices
and
false
tendencies
of
the
times
and
never
have
allowed
impatient
parents
to
give
advice
about
my
lessons
i
have
insisted
upon
a
good
and
instrument
for
my
pupils
and
have
endeavored
to
merit
the
love
and
confidence
both
of
my
pupils
and
of
their
parents
in
fact
i
have
devoted
myself
thoroughly
to
my
calling
and
have
been
wholly
a
teacher
always
fixing
my
eye
on
the
true
the
beautiful
and
the
artistic
and
in
this
way
have
been
of
service
to
my
pupils
friend
but
how
do
you
find
parents
who
sympathize
with
your
ideas
and
with
your
lofty
views
dominie
i
have
found
that
almost
all
the
parents
of
my
pupils
have
entered
into
my
views
if
not
immediately
at
least
after
they
had
been
present
at
a
few
lessons
in
the
case
of
those
few
who
would
not
enter
into
them
i
have
abandoned
the
lessons
but
nevertheless
i
have
found
that
my
time
has
been
fully
occupied
my
friend
do
you
not
think
that
views
like
these
will
assist
in
the
training
of
young
and
inexperienced
teachers
who
are
striving
for
improvement
and
do
you
not
think
they
will
be
useful
even
to
those
who
already
possess
general
mental
culture
and
who
are
animated
by
an
ardent
love
for
their
calling
i
especially
avoid
giving
here
any
exclusive
method
a
servile
following
of
which
would
be
entirely
contrary
to
my
intentions
and
in
fact
contrary
to
my
method
but
as
for
the
rest
alas
all
those
who
do
not
understand
me
or
who
choose
to
misunderstand
me
those
are
the
worst
especially
the
people
the
people
who
bray
about
music
stride
straight
to
the
notes
and
have
no
patience
till
they
come
to
beethoven
who
foolishly
prate
and
fume
about
my
unclassical
management
but
at
bottom
only
wish
to
conceal
their
own
unskilfulness
their
want
of
culture
and
of
disinterestedness
or
to
excuse
their
habitual
drudgery
lazy
people
without
talent
i
can
not
undertake
to
inspirit
to
teach
and
to
cultivate
this
chapter
will
almost
by
itself
point
out
to
unprejudiced
minds
my
method
of
giving
more
advanced
instruction
and
will
show
in
what
spirit
i
have
educated
my
own
daughters
even
to
the
highest
point
of
musical
culture
without
using
the
slightest
severity
it
will
indeed
cause
great
vexation
to
the
and
even
to
the
polite
world
who
attribute
the
musical
position
of
my
daughters
in
the
artistic
world
to
a
tyranny
used
by
me
to
immoderate
and
practising
and
to
tortures
of
every
kind
and
who
do
not
hesitate
to
invent
and
industriously
to
circulate
the
most
absurd
reports
about
it
instead
of
inquiring
into
what
i
have
already
published
about
teaching
and
comparing
it
with
the
management
which
with
their
own
children
has
led
only
to
senseless
thrumming
chapter
ii
an
evening
entertainment
at
herr

herr
zach
a
not
very
his
wife
the
family
of
tz
rather
stock
son
years
old
is
studying
the
piano
thoroughly
buffalo
of
the
dominie
rather
gruff
cecilia
daughter
years
old
shy
zach
i
regret
that
i
was
unable
to
attend
the
concert
yesterday
i
was
formerly
musical
myself
and
played
on
the
flute
your
daughter
i
believe
plays
pretty
well
dominie
well
yes
perhaps
something
more
than
we
are
in
earnest
about
music
madame
of
the
tz
family
because
cecilia
received
applause
for
her
public
performance
yesterday
and
because
buffalo
had
been
unable
to
bring
out
stock
all
in
one
when
did
your
daughter
begin
to
play
just
how
old
is
she
now
does
she
like
playing
they
say
you
are
very
strict
and
tie
your
daughters
to
the
how
many
hours
a
day
do
you
make
her
practise
do
you
make
her
exert
herself
too
much
has
she
talent
is
she
sickly
dominie
do
you
think
she
looks
in
good
health
madam
tall
and
strong
for
her
years
madame
of
the
tz
family
but
perhaps
she
might
look
more
cheerful
if
she
was
not
obliged
to
play
on
the
piano
so
much
dominie
i
ca
exactly
say
zach
interrupting
and
holding
dominie
by
the
they
say
you
torment
and
your
daughters
dreadfully
that
the
eldest
was
obliged
to
practise
day
and
night
well
you
shall
hear
my
stock
play
this
evening
who
some
time
by
the
grace
of
god
is
to
take
the
place
of
thalberg
in
the
world
now
give
me
your
opinion
freely
of
course
i
was
only
to
praise
we
should
like
very
much
to
hear
what
you
think
about
his
playing
though
perhaps
buffalo
may
not
agree
with
you
buffalo
is
looking
through
the
and
picking
out
all
the
etudes
by
listening
to
which
dominie
is
to
earn
his
dominie
and
foreseeing
that
he
shall
be
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
the
industry
of
your
son
stock
what
are
you
studying
now
stock
stock
proud
rather
i
play
six
hours
a
day
two
hours
scales
with
both
hands
together
and
four
hours
etudes
i
have
already
gone
through
the
first
book
of
clementi
and
four
books
of
cramer
now
i
am
in
the
gradus
ad
parnassum
i
have
already
studied
the
right
fingering
for
it
dominie
indeed
you
are
very
much
in
earnest
that
speaks
well
for
you
and
for
buffalo
but
what
pieces
are
you
studying
with
the
etudes
hummel
mendelssohn
chopin
or
schumann
stock
buffalo
ca
bear
chopin
and
schumann
buffalo
lately
played
through
schumann
kinderscenen
that
people
are
making
such
a
talk
about
my
mamma
who
is
also
musical
and
used
to
sing
when
papa
played
the
flute
said
what
ridiculous
little
things
are
those
are
they
waltzes
for
children
and
then
the
babyish
names
for
them
he
may
play
such
stuff
to
his
wife
but
not
to
us
dominie
well
these
kinderscenen
curious
little
bits
for
men
hands
your
mother
is
right
they
are
too
short
there
certainly
ought
to
be
more
of
them
but
they
are
not
waltzes
stock
indeed
i
am
not
allowed
to
play
waltzes
at
all
my
teacher
is
very
thorough
first
i
shall
have
to
dig
through
all
the
gradus
ad
parnassum
and
then
he
is
going
to
undertake
a
concerto
of
with
me
and
will
write
the
proper
fingering
over
it
i
shall
play
that
in
public
and
then
as
he
and
my
aunt
say
i
shall
be
the
death
of
you
all
buffalo
has
overheard
him
steps
now
herr
dominie
how
do
you
like
my
method
perhaps
you
have
a
different
one
nevertheless
that
sha
prevent
our
being
good
friends
certainly
if
any
thing
is
to
be
accomplished
in
these
times
it
is
necessary
to
keep
at
work
that
is
my
doctrine
but
stock
here
has
unusual
patience
and
perseverance
he
has
worked
through
all
cramer
etudes
in
succession
without
grumbling
he
was
wretched
enough
over
them
but
his
papa
bought
him
a
to
ride
round
on
every
day
and
he
revived
in
the
fresh
air
zach
with
his
wife
and
an
old
aunt
are
playing
cards
in
the
further
dominie
but
do
you
not
combine
the
study
of
musical
pieces
with
the
study
of
exercises
in
order
that
the
cultivation
of
the
taste
may
go
hand
in
hand
with
mechanical
improvement
buffalo
my
dear
friend
you
are
too
there
you
make
a
mistake
taste
must
come
of
itself
from
much
playing
and
with
years
your
cecilia
played
the
two
new
waltzes
and
the
nocturne
of
chopin
and
beethoven
trio
very
nicely
but
then
that
was
all
drilled
into
her
we
could
tell
that
well
enough
by
hearing
it
stock
and
dominie
did
it
sound
unnatural
to
you
mannered
and
did
you
think
it
wooden
dry
dull
buffalo
not
exactly
that
but
the
trouble
was
it
sounded
the
public
applauded
it
is
true
but
they
do
know
any
thing
stock
and
i
thought
dominie
do
you
not
think
that
the
taste
for
a
beautiful
interpretation
may
be
early
awakened
without
using
severity
with
the
pupil
and
that
to
excite
the
feeling
for
music
to
a
certain
degree
even
in
early
years
is
in
fact
essential
the
neglect
of
this
very
thing
is
the
reason
that
we
are
obliged
to
listen
to
so
many
players
who
really
have
mechanically
practised
themselves
to
death
and
have
reduced
musical
art
to
mere
machinery
to
an
idle
trick
of
the
fingers
buffalo
that
all
nonsense
i
say
teach
them
the
scales
to
run
up
and
down
the
gamut
gradus
ad
parnassum
the
thing
classical
classical
yesterday
you
made
your
daughter
play
that
by
carl
meyer
altogether
too
it
tickles
the
ear
to
be
sure
especially
when
it
is
played
in
such
a
studied
manner
stick
to
clementi
and
cramer
and
to
hummel
the
good
old
school
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
with
your
eldest
daughter
dominie
the
world
does
not
seem
to
agree
with
you
madame
of
the
tz
family
listened
and
lost
a
trick
by
it
steps
up
quickly
and
says
you
must
agree
that
she
would
have
played
better
if
you
had
left
her
for
ten
years
with
cramer
and
clementi
we
do
like
this
tendency
to
schumann
and
chopin
but
what
folly
to
talk
one
must
be
careful
what
one
says
to
the
father
of
such
a
child
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
with
us
buffalo
is
bound
to
our
stock
by
no
bond
of
affection
he
follows
out
his
aim
without
any
hesitation
or
vanity
and
looks
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
straightforward
dominie
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
you
may
be
right
from
your
point
of
view
we
must
be
a
little
indulgent
with
sensitive
people
but
will
not
your
son
play
to
us
plays
two
etudes
of
clementi
three
of
cramer
and
four
from
the
gradus
but
did
not
even
grow
warm
over
them
the
horse
his
father
gave
him
has
made
him
quite
i
may
be
asked
but
how
did
stock
play
how
i
do
not
wish
to
write
a
treatise
my
plan
is
only
to
give
hints
and
suggestions
i
am
not
writing
in
the
interest
of
stock
buffalo
after
the
playing
we
went
to
supper
the
oysters
were
good
but
the
wine
left
a
little
sharp
taste
my
timid
daughter
did
not
like
oysters
but
she
ate
a
little
salad
and
at
table
listened
instead
of
talking
a
few
innocent
anecdotes
were
related
at
table
about
horses
and
balls
and
dogs
and
stock
future
on
taking
leave
madame
said
condescendingly
to
cecilia
if
you
keep
on
my
dear
one
of
these
days
you
will
play
very
nicely
chapter
iii
many
students
of
the
piano
and
few
players
a
letter
addressed
to
the
father
of
a
piano
pupil
it
is
a
pity
that
you
have
no
sons
for
a
father
takes
great
delight
in
his
sons
but
i
agree
with
you
when
you
say
that
if
you
had
one
you
would
rather
he
should
break
stones
than
pound
the
piano
you
say
you
have
many
friends
who
rejoice
in
that
paternal
felicity
and
whose
sons
great
and
small
bright
and
dull
have
been
learning
the
piano
for
three
years
or
more
and
still
can
do
nothing
you
are
doubtless
right
and
further
they
never
will
learn
any
thing
you
ask
of
what
use
is
it
to
man
or
boy
to
be
able
to
stammer
through
this
or
that
waltz
or
polonaise
or
mazurka
with
stiff
arms
weak
fingers
a
stupid
face
and
lounging
figure
what
gain
is
it
to
art
you
say
is
not
time
worth
gold
and
yet
we
are
offered
lead
and
the
poor
teachers
torment
themselves
and
the
boys
abuse
art
and
the
piano
and
at
the
end
of
the
evening
in
despair
torment
their
own
wives
after
they
have
all
day
long
been
scolding
cuffing
and
lamenting
without
success
or
consolation
you
speak
the
truth
i
have
had
the
same
experience
myself
though
not
to
the
same
degree
and
though
i
did
not
bring
home
to
my
wife
a
dreary
face
but
only
a
good
appetite
but
i
did
not
give
myself
up
to
lamentation
over
i
gathered
up
courage
and
rose
above
mere
drudgery
i
reflected
and
considered
and
studied
and
tried
whether
i
could
not
manage
better
as
i
found
i
could
not
succeed
with
the
boys
and
i
have
managed
better
and
succeeded
better
because
i
have
hit
upon
a
different
way
and
one
more
in
accordance
with
nature
than
that
used
in
the
piano
schools
i
laid
down
as
the
first
and
most
important
principle
the
necessity
for
the
formation
of
a
fine
touch
just
as
rely
upon
the
culture
of
a
fine
tone
in
order
to
teach
singing
well
i
endeavored
without
notes
to
make
the
necessary
exercises
so
interesting
that
the
attention
of
the
pupils
always
increased
and
that
they
even
after
a
short
time
took
great
pleasure
in
a
sound
tender
full
singing
tone
an
acquirement
which
unfortunately
even
many
do
not
possess
in
this
way
we
made
an
opening
at
the
beginning
not
in
the
middle
we
harnessed
the
horse
the
wagon
the
pupil
now
obtained
a
firm
footing
and
had
something
to
enjoy
without
being
tormented
at
every
lesson
with
dry
matters
to
be
learned
the
advantage
of
which
was
not
obvious
to
him
and
the
final
aim
of
which
he
did
not
perceive
until
a
correct
touch
has
been
acquired
it
is
of
no
use
to
talk
about
a
fine
singing
tone
how
can
we
expect
to
arouse
an
interest
by
mere
toneless
tinkling
while
stiff
inflexible
fingers
are
struggling
with
the
notes
while
the
pupil
sees
only
his
inability
to
do
any
thing
right
and
receives
nothing
but
blame
from
the
teacher
while
at
the
same
time
so
much
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
and
he
must
be
required
to
observe
the
time
and
to
use
the
right
fingers
poor
stupid
children
later
after
teaching
the
notes
i
did
not
fall
into
the
universal
error
of
selecting
pieces
which
were
either
too
difficult
or
such
as
though
purely
musical
were
not
well
adapted
to
the
piano
but
i
chose
short
easy
pieces
without
prominent
difficulties
in
the
correct
and
skilful
performance
of
which
the
pupil
might
take
pleasure
consequently
they
were
studied
carefully
slowly
willingly
and
with
interest
which
last
is
a
great
thing
gained
for
the
pupil
rejoiced
in
the
anticipation
of
success
the
struggle
over
single
difficult
places
destroys
all
pleasure
palsies
talent
creates
disgust
and
what
is
worse
it
tends
to
render
uncertain
the
confirmation
of
the
faculty
already
partially
acquired
of
out
a
fine
legato
tone
with
loose
and
quiet
fingers
and
a
yielding
movable
wrist
without
the
assistance
of
the
you
suppose
that
talent
is
especially
wanting
and
not
merely
good
teachers
for
otherwise
with
the
zealous
pursuit
of
in
saxony
we
should
produce
hundreds
who
could
at
least
play
correctly
and
with
facility
if
not
finely
here
you
are
mistaken
we
have
on
the
contrary
a
great
deal
of
musical
talent
there
are
also
even
in
the
provincial
cities
teachers
who
are
not
only
musical
but
who
also
possess
so
much
zeal
and
talent
for
teaching
that
many
of
their
pupils
are
able
to
play
tolerably
well
i
will
add
further
that
the
taste
for
music
is
much
more
cultivated
and
improved
even
in
small
places
by
and
by
public
and
private
concerts
than
was
formerly
the
case
we
also
have
much
better
aids
in
instruction
books
études
and
suitable
piano
pieces
but
still
we
find
everywhere
jingling
and
as
you
express
it
and
yet
no
let
us
consider
this
aspect
of
the
subject
a
little
more
closely
in
the
first
place
the
proper
basis
for
a
firm
structure
is
wanting
the
knowledge
of
the
notes
can
not
afford
a
proper
basis
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
of
service
in
the
execution
of
a
piece
of
what
use
are
the
notes
to
a
singer
if
he
has
no
attack
and
does
not
understand
the
management
of
the
voice
of
what
use
to
the
if
he
has
no
touch
no
tone
on
the
is
this
to
be
acquired
by
playing
the
notes
but
how
then
is
it
to
be
learned
one
thing
more
owing
to
an
for
education
children
are
kept
in
school
from
seven
to
ten
hours
in
a
day
and
then
they
are
required
to
work
and
commit
to
memory
in
their
free
hours
when
they
ought
to
be
enjoying
the
fresh
air
but
when
are
they
then
to
have
their
piano
lessons
after
they
have
escaped
from
the
and
consequently
when
the
children
are
exhausted
and
their
nerves
unstrung
what
cruelty
instead
of
bread
and
butter
and
fresh
air
piano
lessons
the
piano
ought
to
be
studied
with
unimpaired
vigor
and
with
great
attention
and
interest
otherwise
no
success
is
to
be
expected
besides
this
much
writing
in
itself
makes
stiff
inflexible
fingers
but
when
is
the
child
to
find
time
for
the
necessary
practice
of
the
piano
lessons
well
in
the
evening
after
ten
for
refreshment
while
papa
and
mamma
are
in
bed
and
now
after
the
are
happily
over
and
the
children
have
possibly
retained
their
red
cheeks
then
their
occupations
in
life
lay
claim
to
their
time
or
if
they
are
girls
they
are
expected
to
busy
themselves
with
embroidery
knitting
sewing
crochet
making
clothes
tea
parties
and
alas
with
balls
and
now
too
comes
the
time
for
lovers
do
you
imagine
that
the
fingers
of
pupils
sixteen
years
old
can
learn
mechanical
movements
as
easily
as
those
of
children
nine
years
old
in
order
to
satisfy
the
present
demands
in
any
degree
the
technique
should
be
settled
at
sixteen
under
all
these
circumstances
we
find
the
best
teachers
become
discouraged
and
fall
into
a
dull
routine
which
truly
can
lead
to
no
success
in
conclusion
i
beg
you
to
invite
the
piano
teacher
mr
strict
to
whom
you
have
confided
the
instruction
of
your
only
daughter
rosalie
to
pay
me
a
visit
and
i
will
give
him
particular
directions
for
a
gradual
development
in
up
to
beethoven
op
or
chopin
f
minor
concerto
but
i
shall
find
him
too
fixed
in
his
own
theories
too
much
of
a
composer
too
conceited
and
dogmatic
and
not
sufficiently
practical
to
be
a
good
teacher
or
to
exert
much
influence
and
indeed
he
has
himself
a
stiff
restless
clumsy
touch
that
expends
half
its
efforts
in
the
air
he
talks
bravely
of
études
scales
but
the
question
with
regard
to
these
is
they
are
the
practising
of
exercises
without
having
previously
formed
a
sure
touch
and
carefully
and
skilfully
fostering
it
is
not
much
more
useful
than
playing
pieces
but
i
hear
him
reply
with
proud
and
learned
music
music
classical
classical
spirit
expression
bach
beethoven

that
is
just
the
difficulty
look
at
his
pupils
at
his
pianists
see
how
his
children
are
musically
stifled
and
hear
his
daughter
sing
the
classical
arias
composed
by
himself
however
it
is
all
musical
farewell
chapter
iv
a
conversation
with
mrs
solid
and
four
lessons
to
her
daughter
mrs
solid
i
should
be
glad
to
understand
how
it
is
that
your
daughters
are
able
to
play
the
numerous
pieces
which
i
have
heard
from
them
so
correctly
and
intelligently
without
bungling
or
hesitation
and
with
so
much
expression
and
the
most
delicate
shading
in
fact
in
such
a
masterly
manner
from
my
youth
upwards
i
have
had
tolerable
instruction
i
have
played
scales
and
études
for
a
long
time
and
have
taken
great
pleasure
in
studying
and
industriously
practising
numerous
compositions
of
kalkbrenner
and
hummel
under
their
own
direction
i
have
even
been
celebrated
for
my
talent
but
nevertheless
i
never
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
execute
any
considerable
piece
of
music
to
my
own
satisfaction
or
that
of
others
and
i
fear
it
will
be
the
same
with
my
daughter
emily
dominie
in
order
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
to
your
question
i
will
lay
before
you
a
few
of
my
principles
and
opinions
in
respect
to
musical
culture
with
special
reference
to
educated
ladies
of
the
present
time
make
greater
pretensions
and
greater
demands
than
formerly
in
regard
to
music
and
musical
execution
and
consequently
their
own
performances
do
not
usually
correspond
with
their
more
or
less
cultivated
taste
for
the
beautiful
which
has
been
awakened
by
their
careful
general
education
thus
they
are
aware
that
they
are
not
able
to
give
satisfaction
either
to
themselves
or
to
others
and
from
this
arises
a
want
of
that
confidence
in
their
own
powers
which
should
amount
almost
to
a
consciousness
of
infallibility
in
order
to
produce
a
satisfactory
musical
performance
this
confidence
has
its
foundation
in
a
full
firm
clear
and
musical
touch
the
acquisition
of
which
has
been
and
is
still
too
much
neglected
by
masters
and
teachers
a
correct
mechanical
facility
and
its
advanced
cultivation
rest
upon
this
basis
alone
which
moreover
requires
special
attention
upon
our
softly
leathered
pianos
which
are
much
more
difficult
to
play
upon
than
the
instruments
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
a
correct
touch
which
alone
can
produce
a
good
execution
will
come
of
itself
through
the
practice
of
études
and
scales
even
with
masters
it
is
unusual
to
meet
with
a
sound
fine
unexceptionable
touch
like
that
of
field
and
moscheles
and
among
the
more
recent
that
of
thalberg
chopin
mendelssohn
and
henselt
i
will
speak
now
of
the
selection
of
pieces
our
ladies
are
not
contented
to
play
simple
music
which
presents
few
difficulties
and
requires
no
involved
fingering
and
from
which
they
might
gradually
advance
by
correct
and
persevering
study
to
more
difficult
pieces
they
at
once
seize
upon
grand
compositions
by
beethoven
von
weber
mendelssohn
chopin
and
others
and
select
also
for
the
sake
of
variety
the
bravoura
pieces
of
liszt
thalberg
henselt
how
can
they
expect
to
obtain
a
command
of
such
pieces
when
their
early
education
was
insufficient
for
our
exalted
demands
in
mechanical
skill
and
their
subsequent
instruction
has
also
been
faulty
and
without
method
if
you
were
to
request
me
to
supply
in
some
degree
your
own
deficiencies
before
i
proceed
to
the
further
education
of
your
daughter
i
should
not
begin
with
the
wisdom
of
our
friend
buffalo
madam
you
must
every
day
practise
the
major
and
minor
scales
in
all
the
keys
with
both
hands
at
once
and
also
in
thirds
and
in
sixths
and
you
must
work
three
or
four
hours
daily
at
études
of
clementi
cramer
and
moscheles
otherwise
your
playing
will
never
amount
to
any
thing
such
advice
has
frequently
been
given
by
teachers
like
buffalo
and
is
still
daily
insisted
on
but
we
will
for
the
present
set
such
nonsense
aside
i
shall
in
the
first
place
endeavor
to
improve
your
touch
which
is
too
thin
feeble
and
incorrect
which
makes
too
much
unnecessary
movement
and
tries
to
produce
the
tone
in
the
air
instead
of
drawing
it
out
with
the
keys
this
will
not
require
a
long
time
for
i
have
young
hands
to
work
upon
with
skilful
fingers
in
good
condition
i
will
employ
for
this
purpose
several
of
the
short
exercises
mentioned
in
my
first
chapter
and
shall
require
them
to
be
transposed
into
various
keys
and
played
without
notes
in
order
that
you
may
give
your
whole
attention
to
your
hands
and
fingers
above
all
things
i
wish
you
to
observe
how
i
try
to
bring
out
from
the
piano
the
most
beautiful
possible
tone
with
a
quiet
movement
of
the
fingers
and
a
correct
position
of
the
hand
without
an
uneasy
jerking
of
the
arm
and
with
ease
lightness
and
sureness
i
shall
certainly
insist
upon
scales
also
for
it
is
necessary
to
pay
great
care
and
attention
to
passing
the
thumb
under
promptly
and
quietly
and
to
the
correct
easy
position
of
the
arm
but
i
shall
be
content
with
the
practice
of
scales
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
each
day
which
i
require
to
be
played
according
to
my
discretion
fast
slow
with
one
hand
or
with
both
hands
according
to
circumstances
this
short
time
daily
for
is
sufficient
provided
always
that
i
have
no
stiff
fingers
or
unpractised
or
ruined
structure
of
the
hand
to
educate
for
very
young
beginners
with
weak
fingers
the
scales
should
be
practised
only
until
the
fingers
acquire
strength
i
should
continue
in
this
way
with
you
for
two
weeks
but
every
day
with
some
slight
change
after
a
short
time
i
would
combine
with
this
practice
the
study
of
two
or
three
pieces
suitably
arranged
for
the
piano
for
example
mozart
minuet
in
e
flat
arranged
by
schulhoff
and
his
or
similar
pieces
we
will
at
present
have
nothing
to
do
with
beethoven
you
are
perhaps
afraid
that
all
this
might
be
tedious
but
i
have
never
been
considered
tedious
in
my
lessons
i
wish
you
for
the
present
not
to
practise
any
pieces
or
exercises
except
in
my
presence
until
a
better
touch
has
been
thoroughly
established
you
must
also
give
up
entirely
for
a
time
playing
your
previous
pieces
for
they
would
give
you
opportunity
to
fall
again
into
your
faulty
mode
of
playing
i
shall
also
soon
put
in
practice
one
of
my
maxims
in
teaching
that
merely
for
the
acquisition
of
mechanical
facility
all
my
pupils
shall
be
in
the
habit
of
playing
daily
some
appropriate
piece
that
by
its
perfect
mastery
they
may
gain
a
fearless
confidence
they
must
regard
this
piece
as
a
companion
friend
and
support
i
wish
you
to
learn
to
consider
it
a
necessity
every
day
before
practising
or
studying
your
new
piece
of
music
to
play
this
piece
even
if
it
is
done
quite
mechanically
two
or
three
times
first
slowly
then
faster
for
without
ready
flexible
fingers
my
teaching
and
preaching
will
be
valueless
mrs
solid
but
what
pieces
for
instance
dominie
for
beginners
perhaps
one
or
two
of
hünten
etudes
melodiques
a
little
later
one
of
czerny
very
judicious
etudes
from
his
opus
and
for
more
advanced
pupils
after
they
are
able
to
stretch
easily
and
correctly
his
toccata
opus
a
piece
which
my
three
daughters
never
give
up
playing
even
if
they
do
not
play
it
every
day
they
practise
pieces
of
this
description
as
a
remedy
for
mechanical
deficiencies
changing
them
every
three
or
four
months
in
the
selection
of
these
i
aim
especially
at
the
practice
of
thirds
trills
stretches
scales
and
passages
for
strengthening
the
fourth
finger
and
i
choose
them
with
reference
to
the
particular
pieces
sonatas
variations
concertos
which
they
are
at
the
time
studying
likewise
in
the
choice
of
the
latter
i
pursue
a
different
course
from
that
which
the
teachers
alluded
to
above
and
others
are
accustomed
to
follow
though
i
hope
my
management
is
never
pedantic
but
cautious
artistic
and
psychologic
it
is
easy
to
see
that
many
teachers
by
giving
lessons
continually
particularly
to
pupils
without
talent
are
led
even
with
the
best
intentions
to
fall
into
a
mere
routine
we
find
them
often
impatient
and
unsympathetic
especially
in
the
teaching
of
their
own
compositions
and
again
by
their
opinions
and
capricious
requirements
by
devoting
attention
to
matters
of
small
importance
and
by
all
sorts
of
whimsicalities
they
contract
the
intellectual
horizon
of
their
pupils
and
destroy
their
interest
in
the
lessons
mrs
solid
your
careful
mode
of
proceeding
is
certainly
extremely
interesting
and
convincing
but
allow
me
to
request
an
answer
to
various
objections
and
considerations
which
are
now
and
then
brought
forward
particularly
by
teachers
dominie
to
that
i
am
quite
accustomed
the
good
and
the
beautiful
never
obtain
uncontested
recognition
no
one
has
ever
offered
any
new
improvement
and
fearlessly
spoken
the
truth
without
being
attacked
defamed
and
despised
or
entirely
misunderstood
our
age
can
show
many
proofs
of
this
for
example
let
us
remember
homoeopathy
and
magnetism
clara
wieck
was
not
appreciated
in
leipzig
until
she
had
been
admired
in
paris
nor
marie
wieck
because
she
does
not
play
exactly
as
her
sister
clara
does
the
same
is
the
case
with
my
present
book
which
relentlessly
treads
upon
the
incredible
follies
and
lamentable
errors
of
the
times
i
am
quite
prepared
for
opposition
of
any
kind
mrs
solid
i
should
like
to
suggest
to
you
that
there
are
other
teachers
who
have
given
themselves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
who
are
very
particular
but
it
is
not
their
good
fortune
to
have
daughters
like
yours
to
educate
dominie
have
given
themselves
a
great
deal
of
trouble
what
do
you
mean
by
that
if
they
do
not
take
pains
in
the
right
way
or
at
the
right
time
and
place
it
is
all
labor
in
vain
of
what
use
is
mere
unskilful
stupid
industry
for
instance
when
a
teacher
in
order
to
correct
a
stiff
use
of
the
fingers
and
wrist
and
the
general
faulty
touch
of
his
pupil
gives
some
wonderful
étude
or
a
piece
with
great
stretches
and
arpeggios
for
the
left
hand
and
gives
himself
unwearied
trouble
over
it
it
is
a
proof
of
abundant
painstaking
but
it
is
labor
thrown
away
and
only
makes
the
imperfect
mode
of
performance
the
worse
and
now
with
regard
to
my
daughters
it
has
been
their
fortune
to
have
had
me
for
a
father
and
teacher
they
certainly
have
talent
and
i
have
been
successful
in
rousing
and
guiding
it
envy
jealousy
pride
and
offended
egotism
have
tried
as
long
as
possible
to
dispute
this
but
at
last
the
effort
is
abandoned
they
say
that
it
requires
no
art
to
educate
such
talent
as
theirs
that
it
almost
comes
of
itself
this
assertion
is
just
as
false
and
contrary
to
experience
as
it
is
common
even
with
educated
and
thoughtful
people
who
belong
to
no
clique
lichtenburg
says
it
is
just
those
things
upon
which
everybody
is
agreed
that
should
be
subjected
to
investigation
well
i
have
made
a
thorough
investigation
of
these
accusations
with
regard
to
my
three
daughters
and
all
the
talented
pupils
whom
i
have
been
able
to
educate
for
good
amateurs
and
according
to
circumstances
for
good
public
performers
the
great
number
of
these
suffices
for
my
justification
i
must
add
still
further
that
it
is
exactly
the
great
talents
for
singing
or
for
the
piano
who
require
the
most
careful
thoughtful
and
prudent
guidance
look
around
at
the
multitude
of
abortive
talents
and
geniuses
talented
pupils
are
just
the
ones
who
have
an
irresistible
desire
to
be
left
to
their
own
discretion
they
esteem
destruction
by
themselves
more
highly
than
salvation
by
others
mrs
solid
but
it
is
said
that
you
have
been
able
to
educate
only
your
three
daughters
and
none
others
for
public
performers
dominie
madam
you
can
not
be
serious
if
i
were
to
declaim
list
you
might
justly
consider
it
an
exaggeration
but
if
instead
of
replying
to
you
i
should
urge
you
to
read
what
i
have
written
on
the
subject
or
if
i
should
present
your
daughter
emily
to
you
after
three
or
four
years
as
a
superior
performer
you
might
pardon
my
vanity
and
my
ability
i
do
not
possess
any
magic
wand
which
envy
and
folly
could
not
impute
to
me
as
an
offence
nevertheless
unless
circumstances
were
very
adverse
i
have
at
all
events
been
able
in
a
short
time
to
accomplish
for
my
pupils
the
acquisition
of
a
good
or
at
least
an
improved
musical
touch
and
have
thus
laid
a
foundation
which
other
teachers
have
failed
to
do
by
their
method
or
rather
want
of
method
but
you
have
something
else
on
your
mind
mrs
solid
you
anticipate
me
i
was
educated
in
berlin
and
in
that
capital
of
intelligence
a
taste
prevails
for
opposition
negation
and
thorough
criticism
how
can
you
educate
artists
and
when
you
yourself
are
so
little
a
you
are
not
even
a
composer
or
learned
contrapuntist
a
teacher
of
music
wins
much
greater
consideration
if
he
himself
plays
concertos
and
composes
pretty
things
and
if
he
can
calculate
and
give
vent
to
his
genius
in
double
and
triple
fugues
and
in
inverse
and
retrograde
canons
you
can
not
even
accompany
your
pupils
with
the
violin
or
flute
which
is
certainly
very
useful
and
improving
dominie
the
egotist
is
seldom
capable
of
giving
efficient
instruction
that
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
case
even
a
child
will
soon
perceive
whether
the
teacher
has
a
sole
eye
to
its
interest
or
has
other
and
personal
aims
in
view
the
former
bears
good
fruits
the
latter
very
doubtful
ones
i
will
say
nothing
about
the
of
those
egotistical
teachers
whose
first
aim
is
to
bring
themselves
into
prominence
and
who
at
the
same
time
are
perhaps
travelling
public
performers
and
composers
they
are
it
may
be
chiefly
occupied
with
double
and
triple
fugues
the
more
inverted
the
more
learned
and
they
consider
this
knowledge
the
only
correct
musical
foundation
at
the
same
time
they
often
possess
a
touch
like
that
of
your
brother
mr
strict
mentioned
in
my
third
chapter
and
are
utterly
devoid
of
true
taste
and
feeling
while
pursuing
their
fruitless
piano
lessons
which
are
quite
foreign
to
their
customary
train
of
thought
they
regard
their
occupation
only
as
a
milch
cow
and
they
obtain
the
money
of
sanguine
parents
and
sacrifice
the
time
of
their
pupils
you
may
try
such
agreeable
personages
for
yourself
i
could
wish
you
no
greater
punishment
and
now
i
will
speak
of
the
violin
and
the
flute
i
have
never
availed
myself
of
those
expedients
it
is
a
method
which
i
have
never
learned
i
will
describe
for
your
amusement
a
few
interesting
incidents
which
i
had
an
opportunity
to
witness
in
a
not
inconsiderable
city
while
on
a
journey
with
my
daughters
the
teacher
with
the
flute
was
a
gentle
quiet
mild
musician
he
was
on
very
good
terms
with
his
pupil
and
indulged
in
no
disputes
every
thing
went
on
peaceably
without
passion
and
in
time
they
both
twittered
tenderly
and
amicably
and
were
playing
in
celebration
of
the
birthday
of
an
old
aunt
who
was
rather
hard
of
hearing
a
sonata
by
kuhlau
which
was
quite
within
the
power
of
both
the
old
aunt
who
of
course
could
hear
but
little
of
the
soft
flute
tones
and
the
light
thin
modest
square
piano
kept
asking
me
is
not
that
exquisite
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
nodded
my
head
and
praised
it
for
the
music
was
modest
and
made
no
pretension
i
will
pass
next
to
the
violin
the
possessor
of
this
was
a
type
of
presumption
vulgarity
and
coarseness
and
understood
how
to
make
an
impression
on
his
pupils
and
their
parents
by
the
assumption
of
extraordinary
ability
he
consequently
enjoyed
a
certain
consideration
he
was
moreover
a
good
musician
and
played
the
violin
tolerably
in
accompanying
the
piano
in
beethoven
opus
and
in
this
portrait
you
have
a
specimen
of
the
violinist
as
a
piano
teacher
of
course
he
understood
nothing
of
and
took
no
interest
in
rubbish
about
beauty
of
tone
he
cared
only
for
beethoven
he
now
and
then
tried
to
sprawl
out
a
few
examples
of
fingering
in
a
fashion
but
they
were
seldom
successful
his
pupils
also
possessed
the
peculiar
advantage
of
playing
in
time
when
they
did
not
stick
fast
in
the
difficult
places
at
such
times
he
always
became
very
cross
and
severe
and
talked
about
precision
in
that
way
instilling
respect
his
pupils
did
not
jingle
but
they
had
a
peculiarly
short
pounding
touch
and
floundered
about
among
the
keys
with
a
sort
of
boldness
and
with
resolute
jerking
elbows
they
certainly
had
no
tone
but
the
violin
was
therefore
heard
the
better
and
after
each
performance
we
might
have
heard
am
i
not
the
first
teacher
in
europe
mrs
solid
you
certainly
have
shown
up
two
ridiculous
figures
dominie
true
but
i
leave
it
to
every
one
to
make
themselves
ridiculous
mrs
solid
i
am
very
glad
that
you
have
furnished
me
here
with
the
criticisms
of
which
i
stand
in
need
for
i
might
otherwise
have
been
in
danger
of
supplying
you
with
an
example
at
the
next
soirée
perhaps
at
the
banker
gold
but
as
i
should
like
to
hear
your
answer
i
will
listen
to
and
report
to
you
what
is
said
in
a
certain
though
not
very
numerous
clique
who
are
opposed
to
you
and
your
labors
dominie
those
people
would
act
more
wisely
if
they
were
to
study
my
writings
in
which
i
will
make
any
corrections
if
there
is
any
thing
that
i
can
add
to
them
for
the
advantage
of
truth
right
and
beauty
and
now
allow
me
miss
emily
since
you
are
pretty
well
advanced
and
are
not
quite
spoiled
to
show
you
in
a
few
lessons
how
to
study
these
variations
by
herz
les
trois
graces
no
on
a
theme
from
the
pirates
they
are
not
easy
but
i
will
teach
them
in
a
way
that
shall
not
weary
you
or
give
you
a
distaste
for
them
i
have
intentionally
chosen
these
variations
because
they
do
not
lay
claim
to
great
musical
interest
and
consequently
their
mode
of
performance
their
execution
gives
them
their
chief
value
moreover
they
possess
the
disadvantage
for
teaching
that
they
are
of
unequal
difficulty
and
require
therefore
the
more
skill
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
to
compensate
for
this
miss
emily
these
are
very
clear
graceful
variations
which
require
an
extremely
nice
delicate
execution
and
especially
a
complete
mechanical
mastery
of
their
various
difficulties
although
these
variations
may
seem
to
you
too
easy
i
am
governed
in
the
selection
of
them
by
the
maxim
that
what
one
would
learn
to
play
finely
must
be
below
the
mechanical
powers
of
the
pupil
the
theme
of
the
italian
song
which
is
the
basis
of
these
variations
is
very
well
chosen
and
you
must
take
great
pains
to
execute
it
as
finely
as
possible
and
to
produce
a
singing
effect
upon
the
after
the
piece
is
thoroughly
learned
you
will
be
greatly
aided
in
the
production
of
this
imitation
of
singing
by
the
careful
and
correct
use
of
the
pedal
which
raises
the
dampers
the
theme
does
not
offer
great
mechanical
difficulties
but
it
requires
a
loose
broad
full
and
yet
tender
touch
a
good
and
a
clear
and
delicately
shaded
delivery
for
you
must
remember
that
in
the
performance
of
a
simple
theme
the
pupil
may
be
recognized
emily
but
you
do
not
begin
at
the
beginning
there
is
an
introduction
to
the
piece
dominie
perhaps
we
shall
take
that
at
the
last
i
ca
tell
yet
when
a
great
many
things
in
my
instruction
will
seem
to
you
misplaced
it
may
be
that
the
final
result
will
restore
to
me
the
approval
which
i
desire
emily
do
you
always
give
such
a
preliminary
description
before
you
begin
a
piece
with
a
pupil
dominie
i
like
to
do
so
for
i
wish
to
create
an
interest
in
the
piece
and
to
state
in
connection
my
principles
and
views
about
music
and
now
we
will
try
the
theme
first
quite
slowly
and
then
the
first
easy
variation
with
the
last
bars
at
the
end
of
it
which
introduce
the
theme
once
more
and
which
should
be
played
very
clearly
and
smoothly
we
will
then
take
from
the
introduction
only
the
right
hand
and
study
the
most
appropriate
fingering
for
it
i
never
write
this
out
fully
but
only
intimate
it
here
and
there
in
order
not
to
interfere
with
the
spontaneous
activity
of
the
learner
we
will
also
take
a
few
portions
for
the
left
hand
from
the
finale
in
these
you
must
carefully
observe
the
directions
which
are
given
for
its
performance
and
try
to
execute
every
thing
correctly
and
clearly
for
a
careless
bass
is
prejudicial
to
the
very
best
playing
in
the
treble
my
lesson
is
now
at
an
end
for
we
have
taken
up
a
good
deal
of
time
at
the
beginning
with
the
scales
and
passing
the
thumb
under
correctly
with
the
different
species
of
touch
and
the
appropriate
exercises
for
these
i
do
not
wish
you
yet
to
practise
the
first
variation
with
both
hands
together
for
you
do
not
yet
strike
the
skipping
bass
evenly
enough
and
with
sufficient
precision
and
you
might
accustom
yourself
to
inaccuracies
especially
as
your
left
hand
has
as
usual
been
neglected
and
is
inferior
to
the
right
in
lightness
and
rapidity
we
shall
find
this
a
hindrance
for
the
object
is
not
to
practise
much
but
to
practise
correctly
therefore
play
these
passages
first
slowly
then
quicker
at
last
very
fast
then
slow
again
sometimes
sometimes
and
also
moderately
loud
but
never
when
the
hands
and
fingers
are
fatigued
therefore
not
too
continuously
but
many
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
always
with
fresh
energy
at
present
you
need
not
play
or
with
the
pedal
for
in
that
way
you
might
be
led
into
a
tramping
style
with
a
weak
stiff
touch
and
a
habit
of
striking
at
the
keys
with
straight
fingers
and
that
i
do
not
like
we
will
look
for
the
true
and
the
beautiful
in
a
very
different
treatment
of
the
piano
and
first
of
all
in
a
clear
unaffected
healthy
performance
free
from
any
forced
character
transposition
of
the
triads
and
dominant
chord
in
their
three
positions
and
in
various
kinds
of
measure
and
practice
of
these
with
careful
attention
to
a
correct
touch
and
loose
wrist
cadences
on
the
dominant
and
practice
of
the
skipping
bass
in
the
theme
and
in
the
first
and
third
variations
with
practice
in
striking
and
leaving
the
chords
observing
carefully
the
precise
value
of
the
notes
you
must
attend
also
to
striking
them
not
too
forcibly
or
too
feebly
and
take
special
care
with
regard
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
which
do
not
easily
give
the
tone
with
so
full
a
sound
as
the
other
three
fingers
now
we
will
try
the
theme
with
both
hands
together
and
consider
the
correct
expression
and
likewise
the
and
as
well
as
the
nicest
and
we
will
then
take
the
first
easy
variation
of
which
you
have
already
acquired
a
mastery
we
will
play
it
exactly
and
with
the
bass
chords
which
should
usually
be
given
and
which
must
be
played
with
delicacy
and
flexibility
but
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
practise
first
the
bass
part
once
alone
in
order
that
you
may
hear
whether
all
the
tones
sound
evenly
now
the
first
variation
will
go
pretty
well
with
both
hands
together
with
increasing
mastery
of
it
the
requisite
shading
in
the
right
hand
can
be
produced
as
your
right
hand
is
not
yet
tired
play
to
me
now
several
times
first
slowly
and
then
faster
the
passages
which
i
gave
you
from
the
introduction
when
the
right
hand
becomes
a
little
fatigued
take
a
portion
from
the
finale
for
the
left
hand
you
may
also
try
over
the
adagio
but
i
recommend
for
your
special
practice
the
part
for
the
right
hand
in
the
third
variation
you
can
not
make
a
mistake
about
it
if
you
do
not
try
to
play
it
too
fast
and
if
you
carefully
observe
the
fingering
indicated
now
i
will
play
the
theme
to
you
as
nearly
as
possible
as
i
heard
the
famous
tenor
rubini
sing
it
you
see
i
place
the
fingers
gently
upon
the
keys
and
avoid
raising
them
too
high
in
order
not
to
injure
the
nice
connection
of
the
tones
and
to
produce
a
singing
tone
as
far
as
possible
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
you
will
play
the
theme
to
me
once
more
i
perceive
you
play
it
with
too
much
embarrassment
and
not
freely
enough
it
will
go
still
better
two
days
hence
if
you
play
it
frequently
during
that
time
slowly
and
become
quite
accustomed
to
it
in
addition
you
will
practise
industriously
every
thing
which
we
have
gone
through
especially
the
first
variation
but
you
must
always
do
it
with
interest
and
never
with
weariness
of
course
you
will
practise
all
the
little
exercises
for
the
touch
and
for
the
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
and
the
cadences
other
little
exercises
trills
scales
with
shading
for
one
hand
alone
and
for
both
together
the
skipping
basses
we
will
begin
with
the
bass
part
of
the
second
variation
you
observe
that
often
there
are
even
eighth
notes
in
the
treble
while
in
the
bass
there
are
even
triplet
eighth
notes
in
order
to
play
these
properly
together
even
with
only
mechanical
correctness
it
is
necessary
that
the
left
hand
shall
acquire
a
perfectly
free
and
independent
movement
and
shall
bring
out
the
bass
with
perfect
ease
you
must
pay
special
attention
to
any
weak
notes
and
accustom
yourself
not
to
give
the
last
triplet
in
each
bar
and
the
last
note
of
this
triplet
too
hurriedly
too
sharply
or
with
too
little
tone
notice
how
much
difficulty
this
equal
playing
of
the
triplets
occasions
to
the
right
hand
which
moves
in
even
eighth
notes
while
you
play
the
left
hand
i
will
play
the
right
you
must
listen
as
little
as
possible
to
my
playing
and
preserve
your
own
independence
you
must
learn
to
play
this
variation
entirely
by
yourself
with
both
hands
together
but
we
must
not
be
too
much
in
a
hurry
about
it
and
must
give
time
to
it
all
restless
urging
all
hurry
leads
to
inaccuracies
in
playing
you
have
learned
enough
for
but
you
may
play
the
other
variations
with
the
whole
finale
straight
through
that
you
may
not
get
into
the
habit
of
stopping
at
the
difficult
passages
which
you
have
already
learned
new
exercises
for
striking
stretches
and
for
the
extension
of
the
hand
and
fingers
but
this
must
be
done
prudently
that
the
sound
touch
which
is
always
of
the
first
importance
shall
not
be
endangered
besides
this
the
repetition
of
the
exercises
learned
in
the
preceding
lessons
but
all
to
be
played
with
a
certain
shading
and
delicacy
we
will
begin
at
the
beginning
with
the
introduction
i
will
now
make
amends
for
my
want
of
regularity
and
show
you
that
i
can
begin
at
the
beginning
like
other
people
but
all
in
good
time
in
those
portions
of
which
you
have
acquired
a
mastery
we
will
give
particular
attention
to
the
expression
and
to
the
correct
use
of
the
pedal
if
what
i
suggest
to
you
with
regard
to
the
shading
at
any
place
does
not
entirely
correspond
to
your
understanding
of
the
piece
or
to
your
feeling
you
must
at
once
express
your
difference
of
opinion
and
ask
me
for
the
reason
of
my
view
you
perhaps
do
not
like
to
play
this
place
but
very
well
only
play
it
finely
in
your
own
way
it
will
also
sound
very
well
so
i
proposed
the
there
because
the
feeling
grows
more
intense
perhaps
in
the
next
lesson
you
will
acknowledge
that
i
was
right
this
place
i
should
play
a
very
little
slower
though
without
a
striking
then
a
little
faster
here
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be
played
or
we
must
try
in
this
variation
to
present
nicely
shaded
little
pictures
here
you
might
use
more
energy
and
decision
this
place
you
should
play
merely
with
a
correct
mechanical
execution
but
without
special
expression
for
we
require
shadow
in
order
that
the
succeeding
idea
eminently
suggestive
of
the
theme
shall
be
brought
out
with
more
brilliancy
in
general
the
whole
must
be
made
to
sound
natural
without
musical
pretension
and
as
if
it
were
the
production
of
the
moment
and
should
not
create
a
distorted
overdrawn
effect
or
exhibit
modern
affectation
each
piece
that
i
undertake
to
teach
you
will
give
me
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
you
a
great
deal
about
the
correct
expression
in
playing
and
about
its
innumerable
beauties
shades
and
delicacies
while
i
shall
pay
constant
attention
to
the
production
of
a
beautiful
singing
tone
the
next
piece
will
be
chopin
notturno
in
e
flat
for
your
touch
has
already
gained
in
fulness
and
is
now
unobjectionable
this
is
the
tyranny
with
regard
to
correct
execution
which
stupidity
and
folly
have
taxed
me
with
having
exercised
towards
my
daughters
expression
must
come
of
itself
how
cheap
is
this
lazy
subterfuge
of
the
followers
of
routine
and
of
teachers
wanting
in
talent
we
see
and
hear
a
great
many
old
and
young
with
and
without
talent
renowned
and
obscure
they
either
play
in
an
entirely
mechanical
manner
and
with
faulty
and
miserable
touch
or
else
which
is
less
bearable
they
strut
with
unendurable
affectation
and
produce
musical
monstrosities
in
order
to
conceal
their
indistinct
mode
of
execution
they
throw
themselves
upon
the
two
pedals
and
are
guilty
of
inconceivable
perversions
but
let
us
proceed
with
your
instruction
you
already
play
your
piece
intelligently
with
interest
and
enthusiasm
and
without
any
of
the
modern
empty
affectations
if
any
other
passage
should
occur
to
you
at
the
in
the
second
part
which
shall
lead
appropriately
to
the
dominant
try
it
and
combine
it
perhaps
with
that
which
is
written
you
may
make
two
passing
shakes
upon
the
four
final
sixteenth
notes
but
you
must
play
them
very
distinctly
and
clearly
and
the
last
one
weaker
than
the
first
in
order
to
give
it
a
delicate
effect
as
is
done
by
singers
with
light
variations
of
this
kind
it
is
allowable
to
introduce
various
ornaments
provided
they
are
in
good
taste
and
nicely
executed
the
case
is
quite
different
in
the
performance
of
the
compositions
of
beethoven
mozart
weber
and
others
where
reverence
for
the
composer
requires
a
stricter
interpretation
although
even
this
is
sometimes
carried
to
a
point
of
exaggeration
and
pedantry
now
try
the
first
variation
once
more
that
is
better
you
already
play
the
skipping
bass
with
more
precision
more
briskly
and
evenly
we
begin
to
perceive
the
correct
speaking
tone
in
the
bass
and
a
certain
delicacy
and
freedom
in
the
treble
you
need
not
play
both
hands
together
in
the
second
variation
which
is
the
most
difficult
until
the
next
lesson
you
may
first
play
the
bass
alone
while
i
play
the
treble
and
afterwards
we
will
change
parts
and
you
can
play
the
treble
while
i
play
the
bass
but
we
will
not
go
farther
than
the
fourth
variation
i
have
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
piece
we
will
begin
next
a
beautiful
etude
by
moscheles
which
i
recommend
highly
to
you
in
order
to
strengthen
and
give
facility
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
this
may
be
your
companion
and
friend
during
the
next
two
or
three
months
mrs
solid
your
very
careful
mode
of
instruction
assures
me
that
emily
will
acquire
a
mastery
of
these
variations
and
will
learn
to
perform
them
finely
dominie
she
will
be
able
after
a
week
or
two
to
execute
this
piece
with
understanding
and
confidence
and
to
play
it
to
her
own
satisfaction
and
that
of
others
while
her
awakened
consciousness
of
its
beauties
and
of
her
ability
to
interpret
it
will
preserve
her
interest
for
it
the
objection
is
quite
untenable
that
children
lose
their
pleasure
in
a
piece
if
they
are
obliged
to
practise
it
until
they
know
it
do
people
suppose
that
it
gives
more
pleasure
when
the
teacher
begins
in
a
stupid
helpless
way
and
tries
to
make
the
pupil
swallow
several
pieces
at
once
while
he
continually
finds
fault
and
worries
them
than
when
the
pupil
is
enabled
to
play
a
few
short
exercises
with
perfect
freedom
and
correctness
and
to
take
delight
in
his
success
or
when
afterwards
or
perhaps
at
the
same
time
he
is
conscious
that
he
can
play
one
piece
nicely
and
without
bungling
while
it
is
all
accomplished
in
a
quiet
and
pleasant
manner
mrs
solid
do
you
pursue
the
same
course
with
longer
and
more
difficult
pieces
dominie
certainly
on
the
same
principle
mrs
solid
but
if
you
are
so
particular
about
every
piece
and
always
take
so
much
pains
to
improve
the
touch
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
emily
will
be
able
to
execute
several
long
pieces
and
can
learn
other
new
ones
beside
dominie
do
you
wish
your
daughter
to
learn
to
jingle
on
the
piano
in
order
to
become
musical
or
shall
she
grow
more
musical
by
learning
to
play
finely
i
am
sure
the
latter
is
your
wish
as
it
is
mine
otherwise
you
would
be
contented
with
an
ordinary
teacher
you
must
consider
that
when
she
has
made
a
beginning
by
learning
to
play
one
piece
thoroughly
and
quite
correctly
the
following
pieces
will
be
learned
more
and
more
quickly
for
she
will
have
acquired
a
dexterity
in
playing
as
you
may
observe
with
yourself
and
with
every
one
to
be
able
to
drum
off
fifty
pieces
in
an
imperfect
manner
does
not
justify
the
expectation
that
the
piece
will
be
learned
more
easily
or
better
but
to
attain
a
perfect
mastery
of
four
or
five
pieces
gives
a
standard
for
the
rest
in
this
way
and
by
mechanical
studies
such
as
i
have
begun
with
emily
the
greatest
ease
in
reading
at
sight
is
gradually
developed
in
which
all
my
pupils
excel
when
they
have
remained
long
enough
under
my
instruction
and
in
which
my
daughters
are
but
for
this
it
is
necessary
to
continue
to
study
single
pieces
industriously
and
artistically
and
with
great
exactness
for
otherwise
the
practice
of
reading
at
sight
which
often
amounts
to
a
passion
leads
very
soon
to
slovenliness
in
and
to
more
or
less
vulgar
mrs
solid
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
a
style
of
instruction
which
is
illogical
intermittent
superficial
and
without
method
can
lead
to
no
good
result
or
at
least
to
nothing
satisfactory
even
with
extraordinary
talents
and
that
the
unsound
and
eccentric
manifestations
and
caricatures
of
art
which
cause
the
present
false
and
deplorable
condition
of
are
the
consequence
of
such
a
prevalent
mode
of
instruction
chapter
on
the
pedal
i
have
just
returned
exhausted
and
annihilated
from
a
concert
where
i
have
been
hearing
the
piano
pounded
two
grand
bravoura
movements
have
been
thundered
off
with
the
pedal
continually
raised
and
then
were
suddenly
succeeded
by
a
soft
murmuring
passage
during
which
the
thirteen
convulsed
and
quivering
bass
notes
of
the
were
all
the
time
resounding
it
was
only
by
the
aid
of
the
concert
programme
that
my
tortured
ears
could
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
this
confusion
of
tones
was
meant
to
represent
two
pieces
by
döhler
and
thalberg
cruel
fate
that
invented
the
pedal
i
mean
the
pedal
which
raises
the
dampers
on
the
piano
a
grand
acquisition
indeed
for
modern
times
good
heavens
our
piano
performers
must
have
lost
their
sense
of
hearing
what
is
all
this
growling
and
buzzing
alas
it
is
only
the
groaning
of
the
wretched
upon
which
one
of
the
modern
with
a
heavy
beard
and
long
hanging
locks
whose
hearing
has
deserted
him
is
blustering
away
on
a
bravoura
piece
with
the
pedal
incessantly
raised
with
inward
satisfaction
and
vain
truly
time
brings
into
use
a
great
deal
that
is
far
from
beautiful
does
then
this
raging
piano
revolutionist
think
it
beautiful
to
bring
the
pedal
into
use
at
every
bar
unhappy
delusion
but
enough
of
this
serious
jesting
hummel
never
used
the
pedal
he
was
an
extremist
and
in
his
graceful
clear
elegant
neat
though
not
grand
playing
often
lost
fine
effects
which
would
have
been
produced
by
the
correct
and
judicious
use
of
the
pedal
particularly
on
the
instruments
of
stein
brodmann
conrad
graff
and
others
then
in
use
which
were
usually
lightly
leathered
and
had
a
thin
sharp
tone
the
use
of
the
pedal
of
course
always
allowing
it
to
fall
frequently
with
precision
was
especially
desirable
in
the
upper
treble
in
cases
where
the
changes
of
the
harmony
were
not
very
frequent
for
the
tone
of
those
instruments
although
sweet
and
agreeable
had
not
much
depth
and
the
action
had
but
little
strength
and
elasticity
but
on
our
instruments
frequently
too
softly
leathered
which
have
a
full
tone
and
are
so
strong
and
penetrating
especially
in
the
bass
it
is
enough
to
endanger
one
sense
of
hearing
to
be
subjected
to
such
a
senseless
incessant
ridiculous
deafening
use
of
the
pedal
frequently
moreover
combined
with
a
hard
stiff
touch
and
an
unsound
incorrect
technique
a
musical
interpretation
in
any
degree
tolerable
is
out
of
the
question
you
can
not
call
that
art
it
can
not
even
be
called
manual
labor
it
is
a
freak
of
insanity
a
few
words
to
the
better
sort
of
players
the
to
the
right
on
the
raises
the
dampers
and
in
that
way
makes
the
tones
resound
and
sing
and
takes
from
them
the
dryness
shortness
and
want
of
fulness
which
is
always
the
objection
to
the
especially
to
those
of
the
earlier
construction
this
is
certainly
an
advantage
the
more
the
tone
of
the
resembles
singing
the
more
beautiful
it
is
but
in
order
not
to
injure
the
distinctness
and
detract
from
the
clear
phrasing
of
the
performance
a
very
skilful
and
prudent
use
of
the
pedal
is
necessary
in
rapid
changes
of
harmony
particularly
in
the
middle
and
lower
portion
of
the
instrument
you
all
use
the
pedal
too
much
and
too
often
especially
on
large
fine
concert
pianos
of
the
new
construction
which
with
their
heavy
stringing
have
in
themselves
a
fuller
more
vibrating
tone
at
least
you
do
not
let
it
fall
frequently
enough
and
with
precision
you
must
listen
to
what
you
are
playing
you
do
not
play
for
yourselves
alone
frequently
you
play
to
hearers
who
are
listening
for
the
first
time
to
the
pieces
you
are
performing
try
a
few
passages
without
pedal
for
instance
those
in
which
the
changes
of
the
harmony
succeed
each
other
rapidly
even
in
the
highest
treble
and
see
what
repose
what
serene
enjoyment
what
refreshment
is
afforded
what
delicate
shading
is
brought
out
or
at
first
listen
and
try
to
feel
it
in
the
playing
of
others
for
your
habit
is
so
deeply
rooted
that
you
no
longer
know
when
and
how
often
you
use
the
pedal
chopin
that
highly
gifted
elegant
sensitive
composer
and
performer
may
serve
as
a
model
for
you
here
his
widely
dispersed
artistic
harmonies
with
the
boldest
and
most
striking
suspensions
for
which
the
fundamental
bass
is
essential
certainly
require
the
frequent
use
of
the
pedal
for
fine
harmonic
effect
but
if
you
examine
and
observe
the
minute
critical
directions
in
his
compositions
you
can
obtain
from
him
complete
instruction
for
the
nice
and
correct
use
of
the
pedal
by
way
of
episode
to
my
sorrowful
lecture
on
the
pedal
we
will
take
a
walk
through
the
streets
some
beautiful
evening
what
is
it
that
we
hear
in
almost
every
house
unquestionably
it
is
but
what
playing
it
is
generally
nothing
but
a
continual
confusion
of
different
chords
without
close
without
pause
slovenly
passages
screened
by
the
raised
pedal
varied
by
an
empty
stiff
weak
touch
relying
upon
the
pedal
for
weight
we
will
escape
into
the
next
street
oh
horrors
what
a
thundering
on
this
piano
which
by
the
way
is
sadly
out
of
tune
it
is
a
grand
that
is
a
long
heavy
étude
with
the
most
involved
passages
and
a
peculiar
style
of
composition
probably
with
the
title
on
the
ocean
or
in
hades
or
fancies
of
the
insane
pounded
off
with
the
pedal
raised
through
the
most
marvellous
changes
of
harmonies
finally
the
strings
snap
the
pedal
creaks
and
moans
conclusion
sharp
sharp
resound
together
through
a
few
exhausted
bars
and
at
last
die
away
in
the
warm
soft
delicious
air
universal
applause
from
the
open
windows
but
who
is
the
frantic
musician
who
is
venting
his
rage
or
this
piano
it
is
a
parisian
or
other
travelling
composer
lately
arrived
with
letters
of
recommendation
who
has
just
been
giving
a
little
rehearsal
of
what
we
may
expect
to
hear
shortly
in
a
concert
at
the
hôtel
de
schmerz
chapter
vi
the
sentiment
you
exclaim
what
is
that
a
sentiment
for
the
soft
pedal
a
sentiment
of
any
kind
in
our
times
most
of
all
a
musical
sentiment
i
have
not
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
a
for
a
long
time
when
the
to
the
left
on
the
piano
is
pressed
down
the
is
thereby
moved
to
the
right
so
that
in
playing
the
hammers
strike
only
two
of
the
three
strings
in
some
pianos
only
one
in
that
way
the
tone
is
made
weaker
thinner
but
more
singing
and
more
tender
what
follows
from
this
many
performers
seized
with
a
piano
madness
play
a
grand
bravoura
piece
excite
themselves
fearfully
clatter
up
and
down
through
seven
octaves
of
runs
with
the
pedal
constantly
raised
bang
away
put
the
best
piano
out
of
tune
in
the
first
twenty
bars
snap
the
strings
knock
the
hammers
off
their
bearings
perspire
stroke
the
hair
out
of
their
eyes
ogle
the
audience
and
make
love
to
themselves
suddenly
they
are
seized
with
a
sentiment
they
come
to
a
or
and
no
longer
content
with
one
pedal
they
take
the
soft
pedal
while
the
loud
pedal
is
still
resounding
oh
what
languishing
what
soft
murmuring
and
what
a
sweet
tinkling
of
bells
what
tenderness
of
feeling
what
a
sentiment
the
ladies
fall
into
tears
enraptured
by
the
pale
young
artist
i
describe
here
the
period
of
piano
mania
which
has
just
passed
its
crisis
a
period
which
it
is
necessary
to
have
lived
through
in
order
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
such
follies
when
in
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
piano
attained
such
conspicuous
excellence
and
increased
power
greater
technical
skill
could
not
fail
to
be
called
out
but
after
a
few
years
this
degenerated
into
a
heartless
and
worthless
dexterity
of
the
fingers
which
was
carried
to
the
point
of
absurdity
and
resulted
in
intellectual
death
instead
of
aiming
to
acquire
before
all
things
a
beautiful
full
tone
on
these
instruments
which
admit
of
so
much
and
such
delicate
shading
essential
to
true
excellence
of
performance
the
object
was
only
to
increase
mechanical
facility
and
to
cultivate
almost
exclusively
an
immoderately
powerful
and
unnatural
touch
and
to
improve
the
fingering
in
order
to
make
possible
the
execution
of
passages
roulades
and
stretches
which
no
one
before
had
imagined
or
considered
necessary
from
this
period
dates
the
introduction
of
performances
with
their
glittering
tawdriness
without
substance
and
without
music
and
of
the
frightful
eccentricities
in
art
accompanied
by
immeasurable
vanity
and
the
age
of
it
is
indeed
a
melancholy
reflection
for
all
who
retain
their
senses
that
this
charlatanry
is
made
the
solitary
aim
of
numberless
ignoble
performers
sustained
by
the
applause
of
teachers
and
composers
equally
base
it
is
sad
to
see
how
engaged
in
artificial
formalisms
and
in
erroneous
mechanical
studies
players
have
forgotten
the
study
of
tone
and
of
correct
delivery
and
that
few
teachers
seek
to
improve
either
themselves
or
their
pupils
therein
otherwise
they
would
see
and
understand
that
on
a
good
piano
such
as
are
now
to
be
found
almost
everywhere
it
is
possible
with
correct
playing
founded
on
a
right
method
to
play
without
external
aids
in
a
word
with
every
degree
of
shading
and
with
at
least
formal
expression
and
that
this
style
of
playing
with
the
requisite
mechanical
skill
sounds
far
more
pure
and
is
more
satisfactory
than
when
a
feeling
is
affected
through
the
crude
unskilful
and
absurd
use
of
the
pedal
especially
of
the
soft
pedal
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
this
affectation
only
gives
one
more
proof
of
our
unhealthy
stupid
and
unmusical
infancy
in
piano
performances
a
public
drummed
up
and
brought
together
by
patient
persuasion
and
by
urgent
recommendations
of
which
can
obtain
an
abundance
for
the
tormented
cities
which
they
have
visited
can
not
otherwise
get
rid
of
them
attend
these
concerts
and
listen
to
dozens
of
such
inexperienced
one
plays
exactly
like
another
with
more
or
less
faulty
mechanical
execution
and
none
of
them
are
able
with
all
their
thumping
and
caressing
of
the
keys
to
bring
out
from
the
instrument
a
broad
healthy
full
and
beautiful
tone
delicately
shaded
and
distinct
even
to
the
softest
but
instead
of
this
they
fall
into
a
pedal
sentiment
they
play
with
outside
pretension
and
with
intrinsic
emptiness
you
unworthy
performers
who
have
so
disgusted
the
artistic
public
with
that
they
will
no
longer
listen
to
fine
intelligent
sensible
artists
whose
dignity
does
not
permit
them
to
force
themselves
into
the
or
to
drag
people
into
it
from
the
streets
you
base
mortals
who
have
exposed
this
beautiful
art
to
shame
i
implore
you
to
abandon
the
concert
platform
your
hack
at
the
piano
no
longer
find
positions
on
a
railroad
or
in
a
factory
there
you
may
perhaps
make
yourselves
useful
while
by
the
lessons
you
give
for
it
usually
comes
to
that
after
you
have
travelled
all
over
the
world
you
will
only
ruin
our
young
people
now
growing
up
with
promising
talent
for
and
will
produce
successors
like
yourselves
but
not
artists
i
must
whisper
one
thing
more
in
your
ear
i
will
say
nothing
about
simple
truthfulness
about
tenderness
and
sincerity
of
feeling
or
wholesome
refinement
about
poetry
inspiration
or
truly
impassioned
playing
but
if
your
ears
are
not
already
too
much
blunted
you
should
be
able
to
discover
at
least
in
a
very
few
minutes
on
any
instrument
unless
it
is
of
the
worst
sort
or
has
already
been
battered
to
pieces
by
you
how
far
you
can
carry
the
and
and
still
preserve
the
tone
within
the
limits
of
beauty
and
simplicity
you
will
thus
be
able
to
interpret
a
piece
with
at
least
superficial
correctness
without
mortally
wounding
a
cultivated
ear
by
exaggerations
and
by
maltreatment
of
the
instrument
and
its
two
pedals
this
style
of
playing
has
nevertheless
found
its
numerous
defenders
and
admirers
in
our
century
which
has
made
every
thing
possible
this
senseless
enslavement
and
abuse
of
the
piano
has
been
said
to
be
all
the
rage
a
fine
expression
of
our
piano
critics
to
justify
insane
stamping
and
sentimentality
how
far
what
i
have
here
said
relates
to
our
modern
errors
in
singing
and
how
far
it
may
be
applied
to
them
i
leave
to
the
intelligence
of
my
readers
and
to
my
explanations
in
subsequent
chapters
to
return
to
my
theme
i
have
still
one
word
on
this
subject
for
rational
players
even
they
use
the
soft
pedal
too
much
and
too
often
and
at
unsuitable
places
for
instance
in
the
midst
of
a
piece
without
any
preparatory
pause
in
melodies
which
require
to
be
lightly
executed
or
in
rapid
passages
which
are
to
be
played
this
is
especially
to
be
noticed
with
players
who
are
obliged
to
use
instruments
of
a
powerful
tone
and
stiff
heavy
action
on
which
it
is
difficult
to
insure
a
delicate
shading
in
and
for
this
reason
a
sensible
and
experienced
teacher
whose
sole
aim
is
the
true
and
the
beautiful
should
make
the
attainment
of
an
elastic
touch
and
style
of
playing
an
indispensable
requirement
i
prefer
that
the
soft
pedal
should
be
used
but
seldom
and
if
the
pedal
which
raises
the
dampers
is
used
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
only
with
the
greatest
nicety
the
soft
pedal
may
be
used
in
an
echo
but
should
be
preceded
by
a
slight
pause
and
then
should
be
employed
throughout
the
period
because
the
ear
must
accustom
itself
gradually
to
this
tender
maidenly
sentimental
tone
there
must
again
be
a
slight
pause
before
the
transition
to
the
usual
more
masculine
tone
with
the
three
strings
the
soft
pedal
is
moreover
most
effective
in
slow
movements
with
full
chords
which
allow
time
to
bring
out
the
singing
tone
in
which
consists
the
advantage
of
the
stroke
of
the
hammers
on
two
strings
alone
chapter
vii
a
musical
at
the
house
of
john
spriggins
i
once
more
introduce
my
readers
to
the
scenes
of
my
active
musical
life
with
an
invitation
to
accompany
me
to
a
musical
my
object
is
in
a
short
and
entertaining
manner
to
remove
very
common
prejudices
to
correct
mistaken
ideas
to
reprove
the
followers
of
mere
routine
to
oppose
to
malicious
cavilling
the
sound
opinions
of
an
experienced
teacher
to
scourge
dogmatic
and
in
this
way
to
advance
my
method
of
instruction

very
stern
emma
daughter
a
pianist
silent
and
musical
spriggins
so
this
is
your
daughter
who
is
to
give
a
concert
she
is
said
to
have
less
talent
than
your
eldest
daughter
with
her
they
say
nothing
requires
any
labor
dominie
you
must
ask
my
eldest
daughter
herself
about
that
i
have
hitherto
held
the
opinion
that
both
of
them
played
correctly
musically
and
perhaps
finely
and
yet
both
differently
that
is
the
triumph
of
a
musical
education
but
this
cheap
comparative
criticism
is
already
too
thoroughly
worn
out
pray
what
else
have
you
on
your
mind
have
you
not
yet
sent
your
younger
daughter
to
school
they
say
your
eldest
could
neither
read
nor
write
at
fourteen
years
of
age
dominie
my
daughters
always
have
a
private
teacher
in
the
house
in
connection
with
whom
i
instruct
them
in
music
in
order
that
their
literary
education
shall
occupy
fewer
hours
and
that
they
shall
have
time
left
for
exercise
in
the
open
air
to
invigorate
the
body
while
other
children
are
exhausted
with
nine
hours
a
day
at
schools
and
institutes
and
are
obliged
to
pay
for
this
with
the
loss
of
their
health
and
the
joyousness
of
youth
it
is
very
well
known
that
your
daughters
are
obliged
to
play
the
whole
day
long
dominie
and
not
all
night
too
you
probably
might
explain
their
skill
in
that
way
i
am
astonished
that
you
have
not
heard
that
too
since
you
have
picked
up
so
many
shocking
stories
about
me
and
my
daughters
the
subject
and
asks
now
just
how
old
is
your
daughter
emma
dominie
she
is
just
sixteen
years
and
seven
weeks
old
does
she
speak
french
dominie
oui
elle
parle
français
and
in
musical
tones
too
a
language
which
is
understood
all
over
the
world
but
she
is
so
silent
does
she
like
to
play
dominie
you
have
given
her
no
opportunity
to
speak
she
is
certainly
not
for
the
last
two
years
she
has
taken
great
pleasure
in
playing
you
acknowledge
then
that
formerly
you
had
to
force
her
to
it
dominie
in
the
earlier
years
of
her
natural
development
as
she
was
a
stranger
to
vanity
and
other
unworthy
motives
she
certainly
played
or
rather
pursued
her
serious
studies
chiefly
from
obedience
and
habit
does
your
daughter
of
thirteen
years
old
always
practise
her
exercises
without
being
required
to
do
so
does
she
like
to
go
to
school
every
day
does
she
always
sew
and
knit
without
being
reminded
of
it
oh
i
see
you
are
quite
in
love
with
your
daughters
but
they
say
you
are
terribly
strict
and
cruel
in
the
musical
education
of
your
children
and
in
fact
always
dominie
do
you
suppose
i
do
this
from
affection
or
do
you
infer
it
because
they
have
proved
artists
or
because
they
look
so
blooming
and
healthy
or
because
they
write
such
fine
letters
or
because
they
have
not
grown
crooked
over
embroidery
or
because
they
are
so
innocent
unaffected
and
modest
or
we
will
drop
that
subject
but
i
must
give
you
one
piece
of
good
advice
do
not
make
your
daughter
emma
exert
herself
too
much
as
you
have
done
with
your
eldest
daughter
dominie
if
that
is
so
spriggins
it
seems
to
have
agreed
with
her
very
well
but
she
would
have
been
better
dominie
if
she
had
not
played
at
all
that
i
ca
tell
exactly
as
i
said
yesterday
well
you
are
satisfied
now
with
emma
state
of
health
it
is
of
no
use
to
advise
such
people
as
you
dominie
i
have
always
devoted
myself
to
my
business
as
a
teacher
and
have
daily
taken
counsel
with
myself
about
the
education
of
my
daughters
and
of
other
pupils
whom
i
have
formed
for
artists
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
i
have
done
so
with
some
ability
attending
to
him
but
turning
to
but
does
it
not
make
your
fingers
ache
to
play
such
difficult
music
dominie
only
when
her
teacher
raps
her
on
the
knuckles
and
that
i
never
do
looks
at
the
parrot
which
is
hanging
in
the
parlor
and
strokes
the
great
john
spriggins
with
his
daughter
herr
dominie
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
hear
our
daughter
lizzie
play
and
advise
us
whether
to
continue
in
the
same
course
music
is
in
fact
hereditary
in
our
family
my
wife
played
a
little
too
in
her
youth
and
i
once
played
on
the
violin
but
my
teacher
told
me
i
had
no
talent
for
it
no
ear
and
no
idea
of
time
and
that
i
scraped
too
much
dominie
very
curious
he
must
have
been
mistaken
john
but
i
always
was
devotedly
fond
of
music
my
father
and
my
grandfather
on
our
estate
often
used
to
play
the
organ
for
the
organist
in
church
and
the
tenants
always
knew
when
they
were
playing
my
father
used
often
to
tell
that
story
at
table
ha
ha
it
was
very
droll
dominie
curious
john
well
to
return
to
my
violin
i
gave
it
up
after
a
year
because
it
seemed
rather
scratchy
to
me
too
dominie
curious
probably
your
ear
and
your
taste
had
become
more
cultivated
john
afterwards
when
i
accepted
an
office
my
wife
said
to
me
my
dear
what
a
pity
it
is
about
your
violin
so
i
had
it
restrung
and
took
a
teacher
it
seems
as
if
it
were
only
yesterday
dominie
down
his
eyes
the
servant
brings
that
was
very
curious
john
but
the
government
thought
he
could
not
get
on
in
duets
with
me
dominie
curious
so
you
were
obliged
to
play
only
solos
but
to
return
to
your
daughter
will
you
be
good
enough
to
play
me
something
miss
lizzie
in
a
low
she
is
a
little
timid
and
embarrassed
at
playing
before
your
daughter
emma
emma
you
really
need
not
be
so
bring
les
graces
by
herz
and
rosellen
tremolo
lizzie
but
mamma
i
have
forgotten
that
piece
by
herz
and
i
have
not
learned
the
tremolo
very
well
yet
that
is
always
the
way
with
me
shepard
says
i
may
console
myself
it
was
always
the
same
with
his
other
scholars
he
says
i
shall
finally
make
my
way
but
shepard
is
so
strict
are
you
very
strict
herr
dominie
why
my
child
you
have
heard
me
say
so
before
herr
dominie
is
the
very
strictest
but
he
will
not
acknowledge
it
dominie
there
is
one
thing
you
must
allow
spriggins
that
my
pupils
always
take
pleasure
in
my
lessons
and
that
must
be
the
case
because
their
progress
is
evident
and
gives
them
delight
and
every
thing
is
developed
in
the
most
natural
way
we
wo
discuss
that
but
how
are
your
daughters
able
to
play
so
many
pieces
to
people
and
moreover
without
notes
if
they
have
not
been
obliged
to
practise
all
day
long
and
if
you
have
not
been
very
cruel
with
them
while
my
lizzie
can
not
play
a
single
thing
without
bungling
dominie
allow
me
madam
it
must
be
the
fault
of
shep
no
no
you
must
excuse
me
but
we
do
permit
any
reflections
on
our
shepard
he
is
very
particular
and
unwearied
dominie
it
does
not
depend
entirely
upon
that
but
john
upon
my
honor
it
is
marvellous
to
see
how
talented
pupils
always
seem
to
flock
to
it
is
easy
to
teach
such
ha
ha
you
must
not
forget
however
that
my
grandfather
played
on
the
organ
now
lizzie
sit
down
and
play
something
chooses
a
cavatina
from
the
pirates
with
variations
the
introduction
begins
with
flat
in
unison
lizzie
strikes
in
unison
and
the
same
in
the
bass
and
exclaims
there
mamma
did
i
tell
you
so
i
do
remember
it
now
shepard
enters
steps
up
hastily
and
puts
her
finger
on
shepard
pardon
me
herr
dominie
i
will
only
set
her
going
it
makes
her
a
little
confused
to
play
before
such
connoisseurs
she
loses
her
eyesight
do
you
see
lizzie
there
are
three
flats
in
the
signature
john
courage
now
aha
lizzie
ca
get
at
the
pedal
the
is
lying
over
it
john
take
him
out
the
removal
of
the
lizzie
plays
as
far
as
the
fourth
bar
when
she
strikes
sharp
instead
of
and
never
mind
begin
again
herr
dominie
is
pleased
to
hear
that
he
has
gone
through
it
all
with
his
own
children
begins
again
at
the
beginning
and
goes
on
to
the
eighth
bar
where
she
sticks
shepard
do
make
me
ashamed
of
you
lizzie
now
begin
once
more
a
week
ago
it
went
quite
tolerably
begins
once
more
and
plays
or
rather
scrambles
through
it
as
far
as
the
eighteenth
bar
but
now
it
is
all
over
with
her
and
she
gets
dominie
skip
the
introduction
it
is
too
difficult
begin
at
once
on
the
theme
john
his
we
will
go
away
and
leave
the
gentlemen
alone
by
and
by
gentlemen
we
will
talk
about
it
further
over
a
cup
of
tea
refuses
to
dominie
shepard
let
lizzie
play
a
few
scales
or
some
chords
a
few
finger
exercises
or
some
easy
dance
without
notes
shepard
she
has
nothing
of
that
kind
ready
you
see
i
always
take
up
one
piece
after
another
and
have
each
one
played
as
well
as
i
can
she
repeats
the
difficult
parts
i
write
the
proper
fingering
over
them
and
am
very
particular
that
she
does
not
use
the
wrong
fingers
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
quite
worn
myself
out
over
the
lessons
lizzie
does
the
same
and
practises
her
pieces
two
hours
a
day
but
but
goes
away
with
dominie
shepard
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
you
will
never
accomplish
your
end
even
if
miss
lizzie
is
only
to
play
as
an
amateur
and
is
not
intended
for
any
thing
higher
for
which
in
fact
she
has
not
sufficient
talent
you
must
pay
some
attention
beforehand
to
the
acquirement
of
a
correct
tone
and
get
rid
of
this
touch
and
you
must
then
endeavor
by
scales
and
exercises
of
every
kind
to
give
to
her
hands
and
fingers
so
much
firmness
decision
and
dexterity
that
she
can
master
her
pieces
at
least
with
a
certain
distinct
tone
and
a
tolerable
touch
you
are
not
less
in
error
in
the
choice
of
her
pieces
which
are
far
too
difficult
a
fault
of
most
teachers
even
with
the
most
skilful
pupils
the
pieces
which
your
pupils
are
to
execute
should
be
below
their
mechanical
powers
for
otherwise
the
struggle
with
difficulties
robs
the
player
of
all
confidence
in
the
performance
and
gives
rise
to
stumbling
bungling
and
hurry
the
mechanical
powers
should
be
cultivated
by
studies
and
exercises
in
preference
to
pieces
at
least
to
those
of
certain
famous
composers
who
do
not
write
in
a
manner
adapted
to
the
piano
or
who
at
any
rate
regard
the
music
as
of
more
importance
than
the
player
this
may
apply
even
to
beethoven
in
the
higher
grade
of
composition
for
his
music
is
full
of
danger
for
the
performer
the
only
course
which
can
ever
lead
to
a
sure
result
without
wearying
both
pupil
and
parent
and
without
making
distasteful
is
first
to
lay
a
foundation
in
mechanical
power
and
then
to
go
on
with
the
easier
pieces
by
hünten
and
burgmüller
if
you
try
to
produce
the
mechanical
dexterity
essential
for
piano
performance
by
the
study
of
pieces
except
with
the
most
careful
selection
you
will
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
and
deprive
the
pupil
of
all
pleasure
and
interest
and
the
young
lizzie
will
be
much
more
interested
in
the
hope
of
a
husband
than
in
the
satisfaction
of
performing
a
piece
which
will
give
pleasure
to
herself
and
her
friends
there
can
be
no
success
without
gradual
development
and
culture
without
a
plan
without
consideration
and
reflection
in
fact
without
a
proper
method
how
can
there
be
any
good
result
if
the
pupil
has
to
try
at
the
same
time
to
play
with
a
correct
touch
with
the
proper
fingering
in
time
with
proper
phrasing
to
move
the
fingers
rightly
to
gain
familiarity
with
the
notes
and
to
avoid
the
confusion
between
the
treble
and
the
bass
notes
and
in
fact
has
to
struggle
with
every
thing
at
once
and
what
vexations
what
loss
of
time
without
success
listened
with
attention
and
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
upon
and
shepard
go
in
to
well
gentlemen
have
you
come
to
any
conclusion
is
not
lizzie
a
good
pupil
she
is
obliged
to
practise
two
hours
every
day
however
tired
she
may
be
do
you
think
we
should
continue
in
the
same
course
herr
dominie
shepard
herr
dominie
has
called
my
attention
to
some
points
which
will
be
of
use
to
me
dominie
only
a
few
trifles
john
after
tea
will
not
miss
emma
play
to
us
emma
the
piano
is
very
much
out
of
tune
some
of
the
keys
stick
the
action
is
too
light
and
the
instrument
generally
is
not
calculated
for
the
successful
execution
of
any
thing
john
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
considered
by
everybody
a
very
fine
instrument
when
we
bought
it
sixteen
years
ago
we
had
a
great
bargain
in
it
at
the
time
for
we
purchased
it
of
a
neighbor
who
had
improved
it
very
much
by
use
shepard
will
confirm
what
i
say
miss
bows
her
head
thoughtfully
and
looks
at
shepard
john
my
violin
has
very
much
improved
during
the
last
twenty
years
on
my
honor
if
lizzie
were
a
boy
she
should
learn
to
play
on
the
violin
to
keep
it
in
the
family
ha
ha
ha
dominie
that
would
be
curious
wishes
to
take
leave
with
his
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
us
again
soon
the
next
time
lizzie
will
play
you
rosellen
tremolo
and
miss
emma
must
play
us
a
piece
too
dominie
you
are
extremely
kind
chapter
viii
singing
and
a
letter
to
a
young
lady
singer
my
dear
miss
you
are
endowed
with
an
admirable
gift
for
singing
and
your
agreeable
though
not
naturally
powerful
voice
has
vivacity
and
youthful
charm
as
well
as
a
fine
tone
you
also
possess
much
talent
in
execution
yet
you
nevertheless
share
the
lot
of
almost
all
your
sisters
in
art
who
whether
in
vienna
paris
or
italy
find
only
teachers
who
are
rapidly
helping
to
annihilate
the
opera
throughout
europe
and
are
ruling
out
of
court
the
simple
noble
refined
and
true
art
of
singing
this
modern
unnatural
style
of
art
which
merely
aspires
to
superficial
effects
and
consists
only
in
mannerisms
and
which
must
ruin
the
voice
in
a
short
time
before
it
reaches
its
highest
perfection
has
already
laid
claim
to
you
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
rescue
your
talent
unless
convinced
that
you
have
been
falsely
guided
you
stop
entirely
for
a
time
and
allow
your
voice
to
rest
during
several
months
and
then
by
correct
artistic
studies
and
with
a
voice
never
forced
or
strong
often
indeed
weak
you
improve
your
method
of
attack
by
the
use
of
much
less
and
never
audible
breathing
and
acquire
a
correct
quiet
guidance
of
the
tones
you
must
also
make
use
of
the
voice
in
the
middle
register
and
strengthen
the
good
by
skilfully
lowering
them
you
must
equalize
the
registers
of
the
voice
by
a
correct
and
varied
use
of
the
and
by
diligent
practice
of
you
must
restore
the
unnaturally
extended
registers
to
their
proper
limits
and
you
have
still
other
points
to
reform
are
you
not
aware
that
this
frequent
tremulousness
of
the
voice
this
immoderate
forcing
of
its
compass
by
which
the
is
made
to
interfere
with
the
this
coquetting
with
the
deep
this
affected
offensive
and
almost
inaudible
nasal
the
aimless
jerking
out
of
single
tones
and
in
general
this
whole
false
mode
of
vocal
execution
must
continually
shock
the
natural
sentiment
of
a
cultivated
unprejudiced
hearer
as
well
as
of
the
composer
and
what
must
be
the
effect
on
a
voice
in
the
middle
register
when
its
extreme
limits
are
forced
in
such
a
reckless
manner
and
when
you
expend
as
much
breath
for
a
few
lines
of
a
song
as
a
correctly
educated
singer
would
require
for
a
whole
aria
how
long
will
it
be
before
your
voice
already
weakened
and
almost
always
forced
beyond
the
limits
of
beauty
shall
degenerate
into
a
hollow
dull
guttural
tone
and
even
into
that
explosive
or
tremulous
sound
which
proclaims
irremediable
injury
is
your
beautiful
voice
and
your
talent
to
disappear
like
a
meteor
as
others
have
done
or
do
you
hope
that
the
soft
air
of
italy
will
in
time
restore
a
voice
once
ruined
i
fall
into
a
rage
when
i
think
of
the
many
beautiful
voices
which
have
been
spoiled
and
have
dwindled
away
without
leaving
a
trace
during
the
last
forty
years
and
i
vent
my
overflowing
heart
in
a
brief
notice
of
the
many
whose
rise
and
influence
i
have
watched
for
twenty
years
past
the
whom
we
usually
find
even
in
large
cities
and
in
musical
institutions
i
exempt
from
any
special
criticism
for
they
would
not
be
able
to
understand
my
views
they
permit
soprano
voices
to
sing
scales
in
all
the
five
vowels
at
once
begin
with
instead
of
allow
a
long
holding
of
the
notes
in
order
to
bring
out
the
voice
until
the
poor
victim
rolls
her
eyes
and
grows
dizzy
they
talk
only
of
the
fine
which
must
be
elicited
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
will
not
even
listen
to
them
recognize
them
or
learn
to
distinguish
them
their
highest
principle
is
fudge
we
do
want
any
rubbish
of
teschner
miksch
and
wieck
sing
in
your
own
plain
way
what
is
the
use
of
this
murmuring
without
taking
breath
for
what
do
you
have
lungs
if
you
are
not
to
use
them
come
try
this
aria
produce
an
effect
down
on
your
knees
there
are
again
others
who
allow
screaming
the
more
the
better
in
order
to
produce
power
and
expression
in
the
voice
and
to
make
it
serviceable
for
public
performances
they
may
indeed
require
the
singing
of
and
prattle
about
the
requisite
equality
of
the
tones
and
they
consequently
make
the
pupil
practise
diligently
and
strongly
on
the
flat
where
kind
nature
does
not
at
first
place
the
voice
because
she
has
reserved
for
herself
the
slow
and
careful
development
of
it
as
for
the
unfortunate
gasping
medium
voices
which
are
still
less
docile
and
which
sigh
in
the
throat
and
after
all
can
only
speak
such
teachers
postpone
the
cultivation
of
these
to
the
future
or
else
they
exclaim
in
a
satisfied
way
now
we
will
sing
at
sight
hit
the
notes
let
us
have
classical
music
of
these
also
i
forbear
to
speak
and
as
for
the
whose
business
it
is
to
educate
the
voice
for
the
opera
of
the
future
i
am
really
unable
to
write
about
them
in
the
first
place
i
know
nothing
about
the
future
the
unborn
and
in
the
second
place
i
have
more
than
enough
to
do
with
the
present
and
now
i
come
to
those
who
honestly
wish
to
teach
better
and
who
in
a
measure
do
so
but
even
they
are
too
pedantic
with
prejudiced
views
they
pursue
aims
without
looking
around
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
or
forwards
and
without
daily
learning
reflecting
and
striving
they
run
in
a
groove
always
ride
their
particular
hobby
cut
every
thing
after
one
pattern
and
use
up
the
time
in
secondary
matters
in
incredible
trifles
for
the
formation
of
a
fine
tone
not
a
minute
should
be
lost
particularly
with
lady
singers
who
are
not
strong
and
usually
can
not
or
ought
not
to
sing
more
than
twenty
days
in
a
month
and
who
surely
ought
to
be
allowed
to
use
their
time
in
a
reasonable
manner
moreover
these
are
the
teachers
whom
it
is
most
difficult
to
comprehend
though
they
use
only
seven
tones
they
are
plunged
in
impenetrable
mysteries
in
incomprehensible
knowledge
and
a
multitude
of
secrets
out
of
which
indeed
nothing
can
ever
be
brought
to
light
for
this
however
they
do
not
consider
themselves
to
blame
not
even
their
but
as
they
say
the
higher
powers
we
will
for
once
suppose
that
of
the
measures
which
they
are
accustomed
to
employ
in
their
treatment
of
the
voice
and
of
the
individual
are
good
and
correct
the
same
is
true
of
many
but
the
remaining
fourth
is
sufficient
to
ruin
the
voice
or
to
prevent
its
proper
development
and
therefore
nothing
correct
is
to
be
gained
there
are
other
teachers
who
never
can
get
beyond
the
formation
of
the
tone
and
are
lost
in
the
pursuit
of
that
terrestrial
valley
of
tears
truly
a
beautiful
country
but
which
is
only
to
be
found
in
paradise
others
instead
of
thinking
i
will
try
for
the
present
to
do
better
than
others
have
done
so
harass
and
torment
the
poor
mortal
voices
with
their
aim
at
perfect
equality
and
perfect
beauty
of
tone
the
result
often
is
that
every
thing
becomes
unequal
and
far
from
beautiful
some
teachers
make
their
pupils
so
anxious
and
troubled
that
owing
to
their
close
attention
to
the
tone
and
the
breath
and
the
pronunciation
they
sing
their
songs
in
an
utterly
wooden
manner
and
so
in
fact
they
too
are
lost
in
optimism
and
in
tears
whereas
for
singing
a
happy
confidence
in
the
ability
to
succeed
is
essential
others
pursue
an
opposite
course
and
are
guilty
of
worse
faults
as
you
will
see
if
you
look
around
some
of
them
have
no
standard
of
perfection
but
use
up
the
time
in
an
exchange
of
ideas
with
their
pupils
with
mysterious
and
conceited
ifs
and
buts
they
are
very
positive
but
only
within
the
narrow
circle
of
their
own
ideas
they
make
no
advance
in
a
correct
medium
path
some
allow
pupils
to
practise
only
and
others
only
aiming
thereby
at
nobody
knows
what
some
allow
them
to
sing
too
loud
others
too
feebly
some
philosophize
earnestly
about
beauty
in
the
voice
and
others
grumble
about
unpleasantness
in
the
same
some
are
enthusiastic
about
extraordinary
talents
others
fret
about
the
want
of
talent
some
have
a
passion
for
making
all
the
sopranos
sing
alto
others
do
just
the
reverse
some
prefer
a
shadowy
others
a
clear
voice
they
all
rest
their
opinions
upon
the
authority
of
some
famous
who
has
written
a
upon
like
authority
some
cultivate
chiefly
the
deep
tones
because
it
is
very
fine
and
creates
an
effect
for
soprano
voices
to
be
able
suddenly
to
sing
like
men
or
rather
to
growl
and
because
it
is
the
fashion
in
paris
others
on
the
contrary
pride
themselves
upon
the
but
they
are
none
of
them
willing
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
medium
voices
that
is
too
critical
and
too
delicate
a
matter
and
requires
too
much
trouble
for
the
modern
art
of
singing
as
a
last
resort
they
bethink
themselves
of
kind
nature
and
lay
the
blame
upon
her
well
i
will
say
no
more
upon
this
point
but
will
proceed
have
i
not
already
in
my
piano
instructions
insisted
on
the
importance
of
a
gradual
and
careful
use
of
every
proper
expedient
to
extend
strengthen
beautify
and
preserve
the
voice
i
am
thought
however
to
infringe
upon
the
office
of
the
who
hold
their
position
to
be
much
more
exalted
than
that
of
the
poor
still
i
must
be
allowed
to
repeat
that
voices
are
much
more
easily
injured
than
fingers
and
that
broken
rigid
voices
are
much
worse
than
stiff
unmanageable
fingers
unless
after
all
they
amount
to
the
same
thing
i
demand
of
that
they
show
themselves
worthy
of
their
position
and
allow
no
more
voices
to
go
to
destruction
and
that
they
give
us
some
satisfactory
results
i
believe
in
fact
in
my
homely
simplicity
that
the
whole
thing
may
be
accomplished
without
any
mystery
without
trading
in
secrets
or
charlatanry
without
the
aid
of
modern
anatomical
improvement
or
rather
destruction
of
the
throat
through
shortening
or
increasing
the
flexibility
of
the
palate
through
the
removal
of
the
unnecessary
glands
or
by
attempts
to
lengthen
the
vocal
passage
or
by
remedying
a
great
many
other
things
in
which
nature
has
made
a
mistake
and
on
which
special
doctors
for
the
voice
in
paris
and
london
are
now
employed
we
supply
the
want
of
all
these
by
the
following
little
rule
three
trifles
are
essential
for
a
good
piano
or
finest
taste
the
deepest
feeling
the
most
delicate
ear
and
in
addition
the
requisite
knowledge
energy
and
some
practice
tout
i
can
not
devote
myself
to
the
treatment
of
the
throat
for
which
i
have
neither
time
not
fitness
and
my
lady
singers
are
so
busy
with
the
formation
of
true
tone
and
in
attention
to
the
care
and
preservation
of
their
voices
that
they
only
wish
to
open
their
mouths
for
that
object
and
not
for
anatomical
purposes
in
also
i
require
no
cutting
of
the
interdigital
fold
no
mechanical
no
accelerator
for
the
fingers
or
stretching
machine
and
not
even
the
invented
and
used
without
my
knowledge
by
a
famous
pupil
a
of
mine
for
the
proper
raising
of
the
third
and
fourth
fingers
my
dear
young
lady
if
the
creator
has
made
the
throat
badly
for
singing
he
alone
is
responsible
i
can
not
come
to
his
assistance
by
destroying
the
throat
with
lunar
caustic
and
then
reconstructing
it
if
the
throat
is
really
worn
out
may
it
not
perhaps
be
owing
to
the
teacher
and
to
his
mistaken
management
nature
does
many
things
well
and
before
the
introduction
of
this
modern
fashion
of
singing
produced
many
beautiful
voices
has
she
all
at
once
become
incapable
of
doing
any
thing
right
we
will
then
simply
return
to
the
and
in
these
we
will
live
and
work
with
all
our
heart
with
all
our
soul
and
with
all
our
mind
a
reference
is
here
made
to
robert
schumann
who
in
order
to
facilitate
the
use
of
the
weaker
fingers
employed
a
machine
for
raising
the
fingers
artificially
which
resulted
in
loss
of
power
over
them
and
necessitated
the
abandonment
of
chapter
ix
thoughts
on
singing
our
vocal
composers
followed
by
many
and
singing
institutions
have
almost
banished
from
music
the
true
art
of
singing
or
at
least
have
introduced
an
unnatural
faulty
and
always
disagreeable
mode
of
delivery
by
which
the
voice
has
been
destroyed
even
before
it
has
attained
its
full
development
the
consideration
of
this
fact
induces
me
to
communicate
some
portions
from
my
journal
and
to
unite
with
them
a
few
opinions
of
the
noted
teschner
of
berlin
must
we
again
and
again
explain
to
german
composers
that
though
we
do
not
require
them
to
compose
in
italian
they
ought
at
least
to
learn
to
write
in
german
in
a
manner
suited
for
singing
otherwise
in
their
amazing
ignorance
and
infatuation
they
will
wear
out
the
powers
of
opera
singers
and
torture
the
public
apparently
without
a
suspicion
that
it
is
possible
to
write
both
grand
and
light
operas
with
true
characteristic
german
thoroughness
even
german
opera
requires
a
constant
attention
to
the
right
use
of
the
voice
and
a
methodical
effective
mode
of
singing
it
tolerates
no
murderous
attacks
on
single
male
and
female
voices
or
on
the
full
opera
company
it
is
opposed
to
that
eager
searching
after
superficial
effect
which
every
sincere
friend
of
the
opera
must
lament
is
it
then
so
difficult
to
obtain
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
human
voice
and
to
study
the
scores
of
gluck
haydn
mozart
rossini
bellini
and
donizetti
with
a
special
regard
to
this
do
our
vocal
composers
make
too
great
a
sacrifice
to
their
creative
genius
in
making
a
study
of
those
things
which
are
essential
you
consider
it
mortifying
to
inquire
of
those
who
understand
singing
and
you
are
sensitive
about
any
disturbance
of
your
vain
of
your
own
powers
but
you
are
not
ashamed
to
cause
the
destruction
of
man
noblest
gift
the
human
voice
if
taste
feeling
and
a
fine
ear
are
and
always
must
be
the
chief
requirements
in
composing
for
the
great
public
i
ask
you
how
you
can
lay
claim
to
these
three
trifles
when
you
constantly
violate
them
composer
if
had
executed
my
aria
in
as
earnest
and
masterly
a
style
and
with
as
agreeable
a
voice
as
she
did
that
of
rossini
yesterday
she
would
have
given
as
much
satisfaction
for
it
is
much
more
interesting
and
expressive
both
musically
and
harmonically
and
written
with
more
dramatic
effect
singer
you
make
a
mistake
and
you
always
will
do
so
as
long
as
you
consider
the
study
of
the
voice
as
of
secondary
importance
or
in
fact
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
it
the
latter
aria
which
is
composed
with
a
regard
to
the
voice
and
to
the
employment
of
its
most
agreeable
tones
puts
me
into
a
comfortable
mood
and
gives
me
a
feeling
of
success
yours
on
the
contrary
into
one
of
dissatisfaction
and
anticipation
of
failure
of
what
importance
is
the
musical
value
of
a
composition
if
it
can
only
be
sung
with
doubtful
success
and
if
the
voice
is
obliged
to
struggle
with
it
instead
of
having
it
under
control
you
attach
less
importance
to
the
free
agreeable
exercise
of
the
voice
than
does
the
unanimous
public
i
do
not
wish
to
excite
compassion
but
to
give
pleasure
by
a
beautifully
developed
style
of
singing
you
pay
some
attention
to
adaptability
to
the
piano
or
the
violin
why
are
you
usually
regardless
of
fitness
for
the
voice
critics
have
often
asked
why
does
jenny
lind
sing
so
coolly
why
does
she
not
sing
grand
passionate
parts
why
does
she
not
select
for
her
performances
some
of
the
later
german
or
even
italian
operas
why
does
she
always
sing
amina
lucia
norma
susanna
in
reply
to
these
and
similar
questions
i
will
ask
why
does
she
wish
always
to
remain
jenny
lind
why
does
she
endeavor
to
preserve
her
voice
as
long
as
possible
why
does
she
select
operas
in
which
she
may
use
her
pure
artistic
refined
mode
of
singing
which
permits
no
mannerism
no
hypocritical
sentiment
and
which
possesses
an
ideal
beauty
why
does
she
choose
operas
in
which
she
can
give
the
most
perfect
possible
image
of
her
own
personality
why
operas
in
which
she
may
allow
the
marvellous
union
of
her
powers
of
song
to
shine
conspicuously
without
doing
violence
to
her
voice
and
forcing
its
tones
or
casting
doubt
upon
her
lofty
noble
and
beautiful
art
why
does
she
first
regard
the
singing
and
only
afterwards
the
music
or
both
united
this
is
the
answer
to
the
same
questions
which
are
likewise
asked
about
henrietta
sontag
and
all
great
singers
even
the
passionate
seldom
made
an
exception
to
this
rule
although
she
was
not
independent
of
the
theatres
these
questions
should
be
an
urgent
warning
to
our
young
female
singers
not
to
sacrifice
themselves
to
any
of
the
modern
screaming
operas
unsuited
for
singing
but
to
preserve
and
watch
over
their
voices
and
to
guard
them
from
immoderate
continued
and
often
inartistic
exertion
in
fact
to
sing
always
in
the
with
which
nature
has
endowed
them
and
never
to
shriek
to
renounce
the
present
fashionable
singing
effects
and
the
modern
as
jenny
lind
and
henrietta
sontag
have
always
done
then
their
voices
would
remain
useful
for
the
opera
as
was
formerly
the
case
from
ten
to
twenty
years
and
they
would
not
have
to
mourn
as
is
too
common
after
a
very
short
time
a
feeble
broken
voice
and
departed
health
let
jenny
lind
and
henrietta
sontag
be
placed
as
the
finest
models
before
our
young
gifted
ambitious
singers
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
miraculous
phenomena
especially
in
our
times
when
the
modern
style
of
singing
has
for
reasons
difficult
to
justify
so
widely
deviated
from
the
old
school
which
was
so
fruitful
in
brilliant
results
that
of
pistocchi
porpora
and
bernacchi
what
could
show
more
clearly
the
destructiveness
of
our
present
opera
style
than
the
sublime
beauty
of
their
singing
combined
with
their
noble
refined
sound
voices
such
as
may
perhaps
still
be
found
among
you
the
managers
of
our
theatres
are
in
want
of
tenor
singers
who
can
act
they
should
consider
that
tenors
who
have
any
voices
left
have
never
learned
to
act
and
tenors
who
are
able
to
act
no
longer
have
any
voices
because
as
a
rule
they
either
have
studied
too
little
or
have
studied
erroneously
unless
the
voice
has
received
a
correct
and
fine
culture
the
german
comic
operas
lead
immediately
to
destruction
of
the
voice
especially
of
the
sensitive
easily
injured
german
tenor
voice
here
i
take
occasion
to
remark
upon
the
universal
prejudice
that
a
tenor
ought
to
develop
the
as
far
as
possible
that
they
are
the
finest
in
tenors
with
very
few
exceptions
this
mistaken
treatment
has
been
speedily
followed
by
the
loss
both
of
voice
and
health
nicely
shaded
singing
from
onwards
is
thereby
rendered
impossible
and
tones
which
are
always
forced
must
remain
unpleasant
even
although
powers
thus
laboriously
gained
may
sometimes
have
a
fine
effect
in
the
opera
a
tenor
who
wishes
to
preserve
his
voice
and
not
to
scream
in
the
upper
tones
who
desires
always
to
have
a
at
command
and
to
possess
the
necessary
shading
and
lightness
as
well
as
elegance
and
flexibility
should
cultivate
the
and
endeavor
to
bring
it
down
as
far
as
possible
into
the
this
is
as
indispensable
as
is
the
use
of
the
for
the
soprano
when
the
has
too
striking
a
resemblance
to
the
and
is
even
inferior
to
it
in
power
it
is
the
result
of
want
of
perseverance
and
prudence
in
its
cultivation
it
ought
to
be
almost
imperceptibly
connected
with
the
by
the
introduction
of
the
mixed
tones
we
shall
probably
soon
be
called
upon
to
read
an
address
of
young
female
singers
to
the
composers
of
germany
as
follows
freedom
of
thought
freedom
in
composition
freedom
in
the
opera
but
no
annihilation
of
the
throat
you
are
hereby
notified
that
we
protest
against
all
operas
which
are
repugnant
to
the
true
art
of
singing
for
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
compensate
us
for
the
loss
of
our
voices
although
it
may
be
possible
for
you
after
using
up
our
talent
as
quickly
as
possible
to
look
around
for
others
with
whom
you
can
do
the
same
first
learn
to
understand
singing
or
rather
first
learn
to
sing
as
your
predecessors
have
done
and
as
italian
composers
still
do
and
then
we
will
talk
with
you
again
what
a
pedantic
outcry
about
german
want
of
adaptability
for
singing
pray
where
is
there
the
most
singing
it
is
i
agree
in
germany
is
not
singing
taught
in
the
public
schools
and
consider
too
the
innumerable
singing
clubs
singing
societies
and
singing
institutions
that
is
just
the
misfortune
which
requires
a
thorough
investigation
how
many
promising
voices
do
these
institutions
annually
follow
to
the
grave
who
is
it
who
sing
in
the
schools
boys
and
girls
from
thirteen
to
fifteen
years
old
but
boys
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
sing
while
the
voice
is
changing
and
girls
also
from
physical
reasons
ought
not
to
sing
at
all
at
that
age
and
what
kind
of
instructors
teach
singing
here
our
epistolary
and
age
overwhelms
our
superintendents
and
corporations
with
innumerable
petitions
and
proposals
but
no
true
friend
of
humanity
of
music
and
of
singing
has
yet
been
found
to
enlighten
these
authorities
and
to
prove
to
them
that
the
most
beautiful
voices
and
finest
talents
are
killed
in
the
germ
by
these
unsuitable
especially
in
the
public
schools
girls
voices
may
be
carefully
awakened
and
skilfully
practised
and
made
flexible
and
musical
but
they
should
be
used
only
in
and
only
until
the
period
of
their
development
or
up
to
the
thirteenth
year
or
a
few
months
sooner
or
later
this
ought
also
to
be
done
with
great
experience
delicacy
practical
knowledge
and
circumspection
but
where
are
we
to
find
suitable
and
who
is
to
pay
them
a
sufficient
salary
therefore
away
with
this
erroneous
instruction
of
children
in
singing
away
with
this
abortion
of
philanthropy
and
the
musical
folly
of
this
extravagant
age
can
such
a
premature
unrefined
faulty
screaming
of
children
or
croaking
in
their
throats
without
artistic
cultivation
and
guidance
compensate
for
the
later
inevitable
hoarseness
and
loss
of
voice
and
for
the
destruction
of
the
organs
of
singing
the
tenors
who
belong
to
these
singing
societies
and
institutions
force
out
and
sacrifice
their
uncultured
voices
and
scream
with
throat
palate
and
nasal
tones
in
the
execution
of
songs
by
this
or
that
famous
composer
which
are
far
from
beautiful
and
which
serve
only
to
ruin
the
voice
who
was
the
lady
who
sang
the
solo
in
yonder
singing
academy
that
girl
a
year
ago
had
a
fresh
beautiful
sonorous
voice
but
although
she
is
only
twenty
years
old
it
already
begins
to
fail
her
and
she
screws
and
forces
it
by
the
help
of
the
up
to
the
without
any
thing
having
ever
been
done
for
the
adjustment
of
the
and
for
the
use
of
the
and
without
proper
direction
from
a
competent
superintendent
instead
of
this
he
was
continually
exclaiming
loud
forcibly
espressione
while
even
the
street
boys
in
italy
sing
clearly
and
often
with
great
ability
their
national
songs
so
well
suited
to
the
voice
and
in
their
most
beautiful
language
our
northern
voices
which
are
obliged
to
contend
with
the
great
difficulties
of
the
german
language
are
sacrificed
in
the
most
and
manner
in
the
schools
and
singing
societies
while
all
artistic
preparation
by
which
alone
the
voice
may
be
preserved
and
cultivated
is
neglected
who
are
at
the
head
of
these
institutions
and
societies
musicians
it
is
true
but
they
are
strangers
to
any
special
education
in
singing
or
are
not
skilful
who
understand
how
to
combine
methodical
cultivation
of
the
voice
with
practical
execution
their
entire
instruction
consists
at
most
in
hitting
the
notes
and
keeping
time
these
musicians
say
whoever
joins
my
society
must
know
how
to
sing
what
does
that
mean
where
are
they
to
learn
it
and
even
when
you
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
your
academy
a
few
imprudent
but
singers
does
not
the
preservation
of
their
voices
then
require
the
greatest
care
and
watchfulness
is
that
in
your
power
have
you
the
requisite
knowledge
for
it
are
not
these
few
voices
obliged
to
sing
by
the
side
of
singers
who
have
been
taught
in
a
wrong
manner
and
who
have
no
pure
correct
intonation
then
what
do
these
societies
amount
to
do
they
improve
or
destroy
the
voice
they
make
the
members
musical
a
fine
consolation
for
the
loss
of
the
voice
they
teach
them
to
hit
the
notes
and
to
keep
time
a
great
comfort
after
the
voice
has
been
destroyed
by
false
culture
a
who
has
no
firm
decided
principle
who
is
constantly
wavering
backwards
and
forwards
and
who
frequently
leads
others
into
error
by
his
untenable
opinions
who
can
not
quickly
discern
the
special
talent
and
capacity
of
his
pupils
or
discover
the
proper
means
to
get
rid
of
what
is
false
or
wrong
and
adopt
the
speediest
road
to
success
without
any
theories
of
perfection
who
mistrusts
and
blames
worries
offends
and
depresses
instead
of
encouraging
who
is
always
dissatisfied
instead
of
cordially
acknowledging
what
is
good
in
the
pupil
who
at
one
time
rides
a
high
horse
instead
of
kindly
offering
a
helping
hand
and
at
another
time
praises
as
extravagantly
as
he
before
has
blamed
and
kills
time
in
such
ways
as
these
he
may
be
an
encyclopædia
of
knowledge
but
his
success
will
always
fall
short
of
his
hopes
firmness
decision
energy
and
a
delicate
quick
perception
the
art
not
to
say
too
much
or
too
little
and
to
be
quite
clear
in
his
own
mind
and
with
constant
considerate
kindness
to
increase
the
courage
and
confidence
of
his
pupils
these
are
requisite
above
all
things
for
a
as
well
as
for
a
my
singers
are
to
be
educated
for
the
public
for
the
stage
and
must
therefore
sing
loud
study
hard
force
their
execution
and
make
use
of
a
great
deal
of
breath
how
else
will
they
be
able
to
produce
an
effect
what
then
is
the
effect
of
your
culture
i
know
of
none
except
that
they
at
first
are
applauded
because
they
are
young
and
pretty
and
are
novelties
because
they
have
good
voices
and
the
benevolent
public
wishes
to
encourage
them
and
then
they
disappear
in
a
year
or
two
without
leaving
any
trace
the
can
succeed
in
cultivating
not
more
than
one
good
voice
in
twenty
with
any
noteworthy
result
hence
the
decadence
of
the
art
of
singing
unless
some
unusual
disturbance
or
sickness
occur
all
voices
improve
till
the
year
when
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
to
be
attributed
only
to
the
many
voices
acquire
a
sharp
tone
which
is
the
precursor
of
decay
all
voices
are
and
will
remain
more
or
less
tender
if
their
culture
is
correct
only
jenny
lind
and
henrietta
sontag
were
allowed
by
the
public
to
give
out
their
voices
naturally
and
lightly
without
straining
them
and
to
sing
and
and
their
celebrity
is
a
justification
of
this
privilege
but
how
would
they
have
obtained
their
celebrity
if
this
were
not
the
true
correct
and
pure
mode
of
singing
our
singers
also
try
the
and
but
they
can
produce
no
effect
on
their
audiences
by
it
as
you
may
see
every
day
good
heavens
i
should
think
so
with
such
a
with
strained
voices
faulty
attack
and
the
use
of
too
much
breath
a
which
only
gurgles
in
the
throat
or
deeper
that
i
do
not
mean
i
must
refer
you
again
to
the
three
trifles
mentioned
in
my
eighth
chapter
but
some
voices
have
no
and
many
singers
do
not
take
the
right
course
to
acquire
it
what
a
groundless
excuse
here
we
may
see
the
error
of
our
times
people
look
for
the
fault
outside
of
themselves
and
not
in
themselves
the
inventive
power
of
the
age
is
here
truly
astonishing
when
owing
to
false
management
the
voice
soon
degenerates
instead
of
improving
with
time
it
is
the
consequence
of
a
faulty
formation
of
the
throat
and
of
the
neglect
of
london
throat
brushes
if
such
badly
educated
voices
can
no
longer
produce
a
it
is
owing
to
the
unskilfulness
of
nature
and
to
the
false
construction
of
the
necessary
organs
if
the
is
only
a
wheeze
the
reason
is
found
in
the
deficiency
of
palate
and
excess
of
muscles
if
several
times
in
the
month
the
worn
out
weary
voice
can
only
groan
and
sigh
or
can
not
emit
a
sound
it
is
the
result
of
a
change
in
the
weather
or
other
meteorological
conditions
if
we
complain
of
unpleasant
shrieking
tones
occasioned
by
the
mouth
being
too
widely
stretched
then
the
rays
of
sound
take
an
oblique
instead
of
a
direct
course
if
the
poor
strained
medium
voice
even
with
the
help
of
a
great
deal
of
breath
can
only
produce
dull
hollow
veiled
and
unpleasant
tones
that
is
said
to
be
a
necessary
crisis
of
which
cruel
nature
requires
a
great
many
in
the
course
of
her
development
of
the
voice
finally
if
from
long
and
forced
holding
of
the
they
are
changed
into
noises
like
the
bellowing
of
calves
and
the
quacking
of
ducks
and
the
instructor
finally
perceives
it
then
again
we
have
a
crisis
and
alas
no
one
thinks
of
the
three
trifles
what
occasions
the
want
of
success
of
our
many
of
whom
are
musical
possess
a
delicate
ear
fine
culture
and
feeling
have
studied
systems
of
singing
and
exert
themselves
zealously
to
teach
rightly
they
fail
in
the
culture
of
the
tone
which
is
not
to
be
learned
from
books
or
by
one
self
but
only
from
verbal
communication
to
learn
to
produce
a
clear
tone
with
a
light
free
natural
attack
to
understand
how
to
draw
forth
the
sound
with
the
use
of
no
unnecessary
breath
and
to
cause
the
sound
to
strike
against
the
roof
of
the
mouth
above
the
upper
row
of
teeth
to
improve
the
pronunciation
to
adjust
the
registers
these
with
many
other
things
may
seem
very
easy
but
to
teach
them
all
in
the
shortest
time
without
wearing
out
the
voice
and
without
falling
into
errors
to
persevere
in
teaching
to
the
end
even
if
the
pupil
already
sings
correctly
to
know
what
is
still
wanting
and
how
it
is
to
be
attained
all
these
one
must
acquire
by
long
and
constant
experience
when
came
from
vienna
to
dresden
a
young
but
already
celebrated
singer
though
at
that
time
wanting
in
the
proper
foundation
for
singing
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
miksch
called
her
attention
to
this
deficiency
she
devoted
herself
thoroughly
to
the
primary
formation
of
the
tone
under
the
instruction
of
miksch
and
must
still
remember
the
old
master
and
his
extraordinary
practice
in
this
particular
miksch
learned
it
from
caselli
a
pupil
of
bernacchi
he
had
just
sung
as
a
young
tenor
with
great
applause
in
a
concert
and
introduced
himself
to
caselli
who
was
present
expecting
to
receive
his
approbation
but
the
latter
instead
of
commending
assured
him
frankly
that
his
mode
of
singing
was
false
and
that
with
such
misuse
his
voice
would
succumb
within
a
year
unless
he
adopted
a
correct
culture
of
tone
after
much
hard
struggle
the
young
miksch
renounced
all
further
public
applause
and
studied
the
formation
of
tone
assiduously
and
perseveringly
with
caselli
after
having
previously
allowed
his
voice
a
time
for
rest
if
a
has
by
chance
met
with
a
docile
pupil
possessed
of
a
voice
of
unusual
beauty
it
frequently
happens
that
the
studies
are
not
pursued
with
sufficient
perseverance
and
perhaps
are
continued
only
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
instead
of
allowing
a
year
or
more
according
to
circumstances
richard
wagner
agrees
with
me
when
he
says
why
then
write
operas
to
be
sung
when
we
no
longer
have
either
male
or
female
singers
since
modern
progress
has
come
to
regard
the
three
trifles
as
belonging
entirely
to
the
past
and
in
their
place
has
proclaimed
boldness
spirit
power
two
evil
spirits
have
had
rule
they
go
hand
in
hand
ruin
the
voice
wound
the
cultivated
ear
and
provide
for
us
only
empty
opera
houses
one
of
these
evils
has
been
frequently
alluded
to
by
me
it
is
the
expenditure
of
a
great
deal
too
much
breath
the
finest
voices
are
obliged
to
practise
with
full
breath
until
they
shriek
and
the
result
is
mere
sobbing
and
the
heavy
drawing
of
the
breath
just
at
the
time
when
the
tone
should
still
be
heard
even
if
every
thing
else
could
be
right
in
such
a
culture
of
the
tone
which
must
very
shortly
relax
the
muscles
of
the
voice
that
one
thing
in
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
destroy
all
promise
of
success
the
second
evil
endangers
even
the
male
voice
which
is
able
to
endure
much
while
the
female
voice
is
quickly
forced
by
it
into
a
piercing
shrillness
or
is
driven
back
into
the
throat
soon
to
be
entirely
exhausted
or
is
at
least
prevented
from
attaining
a
natural
fine
development
this
second
evil
is
the
reckless
and
destructive
straining
of
single
tones
to
their
extreme
limits
even
to
perfect
exhaustion
the
poor
singer
urges
and
squeezes
out
the
voice
and
quivers
to
the
innermost
marrow
in
order
that
the
two
requirements
of
boldness
and
power
may
be
satisfied
but
the
spirit
is
still
wanting
which
should
be
shown
in
a
light
and
delivery
the
effect
of
extreme
shading
however
is
accomplished
in
a
single
romanza
the
unfortunate
misdirected
singer
who
must
aim
at
effect
lays
out
so
much
force
on
single
tones
or
even
on
whole
lines
and
that
too
in
the
best
register
of
his
voice
the
other
registers
do
not
permit
this
that
the
succeeding
tones
are
forced
to
retire
powerless
into
the
throat
and
the
beautiful
fresh
youthful
tenor
or
bass
voice
concludes
with
exhausted
groaning
and
mere
speaking
tones
the
romanza
is
now
at
an
end
and
certainly
boldness
spirit
and
power
have
worked
in
union
the
task
is
executed
the
better
because
a
rude
accompaniment
has
probably
sustained
the
singer
in
a
most
striking
manner
and
has
completed
the
total
effect
by
such
management
to
which
i
must
emphatically
add
the
continual
holding
of
the
tones
even
in
the
voices
are
expected
to
come
out
to
be
developed
inspired
and
made
beautiful
what
healthy
ear
can
endure
such
enormities
in
tone
formation
such
tortures
in
singing
these
then
are
the
modern
contributions
for
the
embellishment
of
art
a
curse
on
these
evil
spirits
if
my
feeble
pen
shall
assist
in
bringing
such
to
their
senses
and
shall
help
to
save
only
a
few
of
our
fine
voices
i
shall
consider
my
mission
fulfilled
and
the
aim
of
this
book
so
far
as
it
concerns
singing
accomplished
i
have
heretofore
combated
many
prejudices
both
in
earnest
and
in
sport
successfully
and
unsuccessfully
but
one
i
find
very
obstinate
it
has
pursued
me
incessantly
for
years
a
with
a
rigid
strained
and
vicious
touch
proceeding
from
the
arm
may
play
a
great
deal
but
his
playing
is
thoroughly
vulgar
and
without
beauty
he
feels
this
himself
and
the
playing
of
my
pupils
pleases
him
better
he
wishes
me
to
change
his
style
to
their
better
manner
but
he
still
continues
to
pound
to
bang
to
exaggerate
and
to
play
in
his
own
way
and
only
wishes
his
style
to
be
improved
and
his
power
of
execution
to
be
increased
if
a
performer
of
this
sort
is
not
much
more
than
twenty
years
of
age
something
may
yet
be
done
for
the
improvement
of
his
touch
and
consequently
of
his
style
of
playing
but
this
is
only
possible
by
laying
aside
all
his
accustomed
pieces
of
music
and
by
diligently
practising
daily
small
easy
exercises
which
must
be
played
delicately
with
loose
fingers
and
without
allowing
the
arm
to
give
the
slightest
assistance
otherwise
all
labor
will
be
thrown
away
upon
him
how
else
can
you
begin
except
by
laying
a
proper
foundation
for
a
better
style
i
have
frequently
urged
this
principle
both
by
speech
and
in
writing
but
the
difficulty
always
returns
and
especially
in
the
cultivation
of
female
singers
a
girl
of
eighteen
comes
to
me
she
has
heard
of
the
excellent
cultivation
of
my
lady
singers
and
wishes
to
obtain
the
same
for
herself
in
order
that
i
may
hear
her
voice
she
selects
the
erlkönig
by
schubert
that
perilous
piece
which
is
apt
to
lead
even
highly
cultivated
singers
into
frightful
atrocities
heavens
what
must
i
hear
with
the
remains
of
a
fine
youthful
voice
whose
registers
are
already
broken
up
and
disconnected
she
shrieks
out
the
erlkönig
between
sobs
and
groans
with
and
many
modern
improprieties
but
nevertheless
with
dramatic
talent
the
piercing
voice
forced
to
its
utmost
fills
me
with
horror
but
also
with
pity
for
such
a
glorious
endowment
and
such
an
unnatural
development
at
the
conclusion
her
voice
succumbed
to
the
effort
and
she
could
only
groan
hoarsely
and
wheeze
without
emitting
a
sound
she
has
however
frequently
produced
great
effect
in
society
and
drawn
tears
with
this
performance
it
is
her
favorite
piece
let
us
abandon
this
singing
for
parties
this
melancholy
everywhere
so
obtrusive
the
girl
is
only
eighteen
years
old
is
she
beyond
salvation
i
endeavor
to
build
her
voice
up
again
gradually
by
gentle
practice
she
succeeds
very
well
in
it
and
after
six
lessons
her
natural
docility
arouses
hope
the
again
make
their
appearance
and
the
practice
of
brings
out
once
more
the
stifled
voice
which
had
been
forced
back
into
the
throat
by
senseless
exertions
a
better
attack
begins
to
be
developed
and
the
returns
to
its
natural
limits
she
now
declared
with
her
mother
approval
that
she
really
would
continue
to
study
in
this
way
but
she
could
not
give
up
the
performance
of
her
effective
and
spirited
conception
of
the
erlkönig
she
came
a
few
times
more
i
could
perceive
that
the
good
structure
was
tottering
after
a
few
months
she
had
entirely
sacrificed
her
voice
to
this
single
erlkönig
in
such
tender
years
one
such
idol
is
sufficient
what
a
price
for
an
erlkönig
the
old
experienced
miksch
of
dresden
with
the
exception
of
rossini
the
last
famous
champion
of
the
old
school
has
often
warned
me
that
radical
amendment
is
seldom
possible
with
such
and
broken
voices
which
already
are
obliged
to
struggle
with
enfeebled
muscles
even
although
youth
may
excite
great
and
decided
hopes
there
is
also
another
difficulty
that
one
of
these
strong
voices
must
hereafter
be
used
with
much
less
strength
if
we
wish
to
cultivate
a
correct
tone
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
when
they
are
restored
to
their
true
limit
will
ever
come
out
again
as
powerful
and
at
the
same
time
as
beautiful
let
no
musician
however
talented
and
cultivated
he
may
be
ever
adopt
the
teaching
of
singing
unless
he
can
combine
with
firmness
of
character
great
patience
perseverance
and
disinterestedness
otherwise
he
will
experience
very
little
pleasure
and
very
little
gratitude
even
if
the
erlkönig
does
not
stand
in
the
way
every
voice
presents
new
and
peculiar
difficulties
few
words
addressed
to
on
the
accompaniment
of
etudes
exercises
scales
it
is
common
for
teachers
to
play
their
accompaniments
as
furiously
as
if
they
had
to
enter
into
a
struggle
for
life
and
death
with
their
singers
at
the
beginning
of
the
lesson
the
lady
singer
ought
to
commence
quite
at
in
the
octave
and
to
sing
up
and
down
from
there
through
five
or
six
notes
without
any
expenditure
of
breath
and
should
guide
and
bring
out
her
voice
by
a
gentle
practice
of
and
yet
you
bang
and
pound
on
the
keys
as
if
you
had
to
accompany
drums
and
trumpets
do
you
not
perceive
that
in
this
way
you
induce
your
pupils
to
strain
and
force
their
voices
and
that
you
mislead
them
into
a
false
method
in
such
a
noise
and
while
you
are
making
such
a
monstrous
expenditure
of
strength
to
which
you
add
a
sharp
uneasy
touch
and
a
frequent
spreading
of
the
chords
how
can
you
watch
the
delicate
movements
of
the
singer
throat
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
explain
how
such
a
rude
accompaniment
must
interfere
with
the
effort
to
sing
firmly
and
delicately
are
you
not
aware
that
a
light
and
agreeable
but
at
the
same
time
firm
and
decided
accompaniment
encourages
and
sustains
the
singer
and
also
assists
and
inspires
her
you
ought
in
every
way
to
seek
to
cultivate
in
your
pupil
the
feeling
for
the
right
the
true
and
the
beautiful
but
what
is
the
girl
of
eighteen
to
think
of
culture
and
sentiment
if
you
pound
the
keys
as
if
you
were
one
of
the
while
this
is
your
mode
of
accompanying
the
études
how
then
do
you
accompany
the
aria
the
song
if
for
instance
the
pupil
is
singing
tenderly
and
wishes
to
bring
out
an
artistic
delicate
shading
you
take
advantage
of
that
occasion
to
make
yourself
heard
and
to
annoy
the
singer
and
the
audience
with
your
rough
shading
a
who
does
not
take
pains
to
acquire
a
good
delicate
touch
and
who
neglects
to
pay
constant
attention
to
it
is
wanting
in
the
first
requirement
and
this
is
closely
connected
with
the
want
of
the
three
trifles
chapter
x
visit
at
fatima
years
an
aunt
dominie
the
end
of
the
evening

the
piano

out
of

my
teacher
says
dominie
but
does
not
your
teacher
attend
to
having
your
piano
always
kept
in
tune
fatima
mamma
says
it
is
too
expensive
to
have
it
tuned
so
often
it
gets
out
of
tune
again
so
quickly
it
is
an
old
piano
as
you
see
mamma
is
always
saying

shall
have
a
chickering

regularly
once
in
three
months
the
time

not
yet
up
dominie
but
is
your
teacher
satisfied
with
the
tuning
of
your
piano
fatima
well
he
has
got
used
to
it
it
is
the
same
with
the
other
instruments
he
teaches
on
now

is
a
judge

but
what
shall

play
mamma
you
have
got
heaps
of
notes

but
i
do
know
which
pieces
miss
fatima
can
master
and
which
she
has
now
at
her
fingers
ends
aunt
pray
dominie
choose
any
thing
they
are
all
fine
pieces
it
makes
no
difference
to
her
which
she
plays
dominie
but
do
you
play
that
whole
heap
aunt
she
has
played
it
all
she
has
played
ever
since
she
was
ten
years
old
and
she
has
a
very
good
teacher
he
taught
here
when
my
sister
used
to
accompany
her
lover
solos
on
the
flute
oh
those
were
charming
musical
evenings
and
the
teacher
often
played
the
guitar
with
them
it
was
just
like
a
concert
dominie
indeed
that
must
have
been
very
fine
now
miss
i
beg
fatima
but
mamma
just
say
what
i
shall
play
dominie
is
not
your
teacher
here
this
evening
he
will
know
best
aunt
to
he
is
busy
this
evening
composing
some
grand
bravoura
variations
which
are
to
be
dedicated
to
fatima
on
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
day
after
you
must
come
to
see
us
on
that
day
fatima
will
play
them
at
sight
fatima
do
hold
back
any
longer
play
the
huguenots
by
thalberg
that
a
very
fine
piece
dominie
pray
do
i
have
not
heard
it
since
i
heard
thalberg
play
it
aunt
do
you
make
your
daughters
play
it
then
oh
that
magnificent
choral
that
brings
tears
to
my
eyes
but
the
dear
child
always
takes
it
too
fast
her
fingers
run
away
with
her
here
it
is
please
turn
round
so
that
you
can
see
her
hands
dominie
you
are
such
a
famous
teacher
perhaps
you
can
make
some
suggestions
was
expected
only
to
dominie
i
do
like
to
disturb
her
freedom
in
playing
but
i
will
turn
round
if
you
say
so
scurries
through
the
piece
excitedly
and
plays
in
a
bold
way
not
however
without
ability
but
with
a
feeble
touch
without
proper
fingering
without
tone
without
time
and
gets
over
the
first
two
pages
with
her
foot
always
on
the
pedal
in
such
a
senseless
indistinct
manner
that
dominie
in
despair
was
forced
to
interrupt
with
the
remark
but
you
might
take
the
a
little
more
quietly
leans
back
amazed
and
stops
playing
looking
at
her
mother
with
a
contemptuous
aunt
it
is
owing
to
her
great
execution
and
then
too
her
youthful
enthusiasm
do
you
like
her
natural
expression
fatima
my
teacher
always
makes
me
play
it
so
it
is
in
that
way
that
i
have
learned
to
play
so
much
at
sight
dominie
but
do
you
study
your
pieces
fatima
for
the
last
four
years
i
have
played
only
at
sight
so
that
now
i
can
get
on
anywhere
in
the
musical
clubs
that
is
what
mamma
likes
dominie
but
do
you
not
play
any
scales
and
études
do
you
not
practise
any
exercises
aunt
she
has
not
done
those
things
for
the
last
four
years
my
sister
thinks
it
is
rather
a
hindrance
and
is
too
pedantic
her
teacher
thinks
so
too
and
he
teaches
her
the
fine
concert
pieces
of
döhler
liszt
dreyschock
willmer
and
thalberg
she
learns
execution
by
these
she
has
gone
through
all
thalberg
music
and
we
have
sent
to
leipzig
for
willmer
pompa
di
festa
dominie
all
this
shows
great
enthusiasm
but
really
a
little
too
much
hot
haste
wishes
to
continue
the
conversation
in
order
to
escape
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
turning
round
to
the
piano
my
child
just
begin
again
at
the
beginning
and
let
us
enjoy
the
whole
of
the
huguenots
dominie
likes
it
consents
and
hurries
through
the
whole
potpourri
with
a
confident
conceited
air
to
the
great
despair
of
dominie
at
the
choral
the
aunt
taps
him
on
the
shoulder
and
aunt
is
not
that
touching
it
is
a
little
too
fast
you
will
agree
but
then
the
execution
has
not
the
girl
a
great
deal
of
talent
just
hear
but
what
did
dominie
say
after
the
performance
was
over
he
only
bowed
stiffly
and
what
he
said
to
himself
will
always
remain
a
secret
he
only
they
go
in
to
supper
all
who
submitted
to
hearing
the
daughter
perform
on
the
badly
tuned
piano
which
was
at
least
a
tone
and
a
half
too
low
were
invited
to
supper
and
handsomely
treated
the
wine
was
better
than
the
piano
presently
the
teacher
feeble
having
finished
his
birthday
bravoura
composition
appeared
and
was
introduced
fatima
whispered
to
him
giggling
i
played
the
whole
of
huguenots
it
went
splendidly
feeble
simpered
dominie
and
he
talked
together
unheard
at
the
end
of
the
table
dominie
the
young
lady
has
talent
feeble
feeble
indeed
she
has
dominie
how
is
it
feeble
that
she
does
not
combine
serious
studies
with
her
playing
feeble
oh
i
used
to
make
her
play
exercises
by
mueller
and
some
etudes
of
czerny
and
sometimes
a
few
scales
but
the
child
was
so
volatile
and
had
so
little
perseverance
and
was
so
quick
at
learning
every
thing
and
then
her
mother
wanted
her
to
play
modern
pieces
for
parties
and
we
had
to
busy
ourselves
with
those
but
our
method
has
borne
good
fruit
as
you
can
see
is
not
it
so
dominie
do
you
not
think
with
firmness
and
decision
you
could
have
set
on
the
right
track
could
not
you
cultivate
the
mechanical
powers
of
your
pupil
and
combine
an
understanding
of
the
musical
construction
of
the
piece
with
her
playing
at
sight
the
young
lady
not
to
speak
of
other
faults
has
no
tone
on
the
piano
feeble
she
can
use
the
pedal
for
that
and
when
she
is
older
she
will
acquire
more
strength
her
touch
is
a
little
too
weak
at
present
and
besides
she
is
not
to
play
in
public
for
money
but
only
in
company
and
because
it
is
the
fashion
indeed
my
dear
sir
if
i
insisted
on
scales
and
exercises
i
should
have
very
few
lessons
in
this
city
i
have
a
wife
and
children
to
support
and
my
old
father
the
former
organist
is
dependent
upon
me
you
can
do
all
this
with
your
own
children
but
think
how
much
time
it
requires
to
the
music
company
bid
each
other
fatima
to
i
believe
your
daughter
emma
is
a
very
good
player
but
they
say
she
has
not
so
much
talent
as
your
eldest
daughter
dominie
indeed
who
told
you
that
chapter
xi
secrets
a
discourse
on
delivered
to
an
audience
of
lady
pupils
ladies
as
i
am
about
to
make
a
journey
of
a
few
weeks
with
my
daughters
we
will
suspend
for
a
short
time
our
musical
meetings
on
my
return
you
will
resume
them
with
fresh
interest
we
will
then
not
only
play
and
sing
together
but
occasionally
talk
upon
kindred
subjects
your
friends
will
be
made
welcome
provided
they
are
really
interested
in
simple
and
noble
musical
performances
which
make
no
attempt
at
display
we
will
exclude
from
our
circle
malicious
criticism
and
idle
curiosity
we
require
the
accompaniment
of
the
violin
and
but
not
of
those
two
disturbing
elements
i
wish
to
propound
a
query
in
regard
to
to
the
partial
solution
of
which
you
will
perhaps
be
glad
to
give
some
attention
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
always
speak
only
upon
subjects
which
are
not
even
mentioned
in
the
most
crowded
why
is
it
that
our
young
educated
ladies
who
enjoy
the
advantages
of
sufficient
talent
industry
a
serious
purpose
and
all
the
necessary
aids
are
usually
dissatisfied
with
their
progress
and
with
their
success
in
their
education
is
a
sufficiently
careful
one
extending
to
all
branches
of
knowledge
but
their
intellectual
advancement
in
music
although
it
has
been
fostered
for
years
by
constantly
listening
to
good
music
and
frequently
to
the
performances
of
distinguished
players
and
by
a
critical
comparison
of
their
own
performances
with
these
is
still
small
in
proportion
to
their
power
of
execution
and
to
the
mechanical
facility
which
they
have
acquired
these
are
certainly
essential
to
a
correct
and
agreeable
rendering
of
a
piece
of
music
the
compositions
which
are
to
be
performed
ought
however
never
to
demand
the
exercise
of
all
the
mechanical
skill
which
has
been
acquired
for
in
that
case
by
the
struggle
with
mechanical
difficulties
only
embarrassment
discouragement
and
anxious
haste
are
apt
to
take
the
place
of
boldness
confidence
in
one
self
and
command
of
the
music
it
is
the
duty
of
teachers
in
choosing
studies
for
the
improvement
of
technique
to
select
only
such
as
are
within
the
mechanical
powers
of
the
pupil
in
order
that
he
may
make
steady
progress
and
may
acquire
a
pure
and
delicate
style
of
execution
retaining
at
the
same
time
a
lively
interest
in
his
pursuit
but
why
has
the
acquirement
of
this
technique
been
usually
unsuccessful
because
you
begin
to
acquire
it
too
late
in
order
to
gain
facility
and
flexibility
of
the
fingers
and
wrist
which
a
child
in
the
sixth
or
seventh
year
with
a
skilful
teacher
may
acquire
in
four
lessons
from
fifteen
to
twenty
lessons
according
to
the
construction
of
the
hand
are
necessary
with
persons
from
ten
to
fourteen
years
old
for
other
reasons
also
we
must
urge
that
the
mechanical
facility
should
usually
be
acquired
or
at
least
a
complete
foundation
for
it
laid
in
childhood
and
not
left
to
be
formed
by
a
course
which
is
destructive
of
all
spirit
at
an
age
when
labor
is
performed
with
an
age
when
our
ladies
are
talking
a
great
deal
of
musical
interpretations
of
tenderness
and
depth
of
feeling
of
poetry
and
inspiration
in
playing
to
which
they
are
led
by
the
possession
of
our
classical
piano
compositions
and
immortal
and
by
intellectual
friends
and
teachers
aiming
at
the
highest
culture
you
reply
but
even
if
your
mode
of
elementary
instruction
should
meet
with
faithful
disciples
how
in
such
young
pupils
are
we
to
find
perseverance
and
sense
enough
to
continue
these
severe
exercises
even
in
your
interesting
manner
my
dear
ladies
children
ought
to
do
it
merely
from
habit
although
in
many
cases
after
the
beginning
talent
and
correct
musical
instinct
may
make
their
appearance
uninterrupted
enjoyment
would
indeed
be
unnatural
and
where
you
find
it
vanity
will
usually
be
its
moving
spring
and
this
seldom
bears
good
fruit
you
may
as
well
ask
whether
our
great
literary
men
and
artists
always
like
to
go
to
school
or
whether
they
did
not
delight
in
a
holiday
let
this
be
the
answer
to
the
strange
question
do
your
daughters
like
to
play
good
heavens
after
they
are
able
to
play
and
that
without
much
effort
and
a
little
at
sight
when
they
can
master
with
a
musical
appreciation
easy
graceful
salon
music
or
even
the
easier
compositions
of
beethoven
mendelssohn
chopin
hummel
moscheles
then
they
take
pleasure
in
playing
and
they
play
a
great
deal
and
with
enthusiasm
but
in
case
children
should
sometimes
begin
in
their
sixth
year
you
must
remember
what
is
said
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
work
with
regard
to
the
prevalent
false
method
of
teaching
beginners
you
however
are
supposed
to
have
had
better
and
more
sensible
teachers
let
me
nevertheless
quote
for
your
amusement
the
remark
which
i
have
heard
so
frequently
in
the
course
of
my
long
life
as
a
in
the
beginning
a
poor
rattling
piano
that
is
forty
years
old
and
that
is
tuned
regularly
once
a
year
and
a
cheap
teacher
will
do
well
enough
as
soon
as
the
children
learn
to
play
really
well
then
we
will
have
a
better
piano
and
a
better
teacher
yes
but
that
time
never
comes
and
the
parents
soon
conclude
that
even
the
most
gifted
children
have
no
talent
and
take
no
pleasure
in
music
and
so
they
stop
learning
only
to
regret
it
when
they
are
older
but
the
parents
console
themselves
and
after
a
while
the
old
piano
is
never
tuned
at
all
but
as
i
have
told
you
i
do
not
refer
here
to
teachers
for
whom
i
have
a
personal
regard
and
who
teach
on
excellent
pianos
do
be
angry
with
me
for
my
suggestion
ladies
do
not
make
enough
use
of
the
while
our
learned
education
absorbs
so
much
time
while
our
friends
require
so
many
hours
while
alas
balls
and
dinners
consume
whole
days
we
must
be
sparing
of
the
remaining
minutes
now
i
must
rush
to
the
piano
i
must
go
to
dinner
in
ten
minutes
two
scales
two
finger
exercises
two
difficult
passages
out
of
the
piece
i
have
to
learn
and
one
exercise
to
invent
on
the
dominant
and
are
soon
done
and
then
the
dinner
will
taste
all
the
better
my
dear
agnes
we
might
talk
for
ever
about
this
dreadful
snow
it
wo
melt
the
sooner
for
it
how
do
you
like
this
passage
that
i
am
going
to
play
to
you
it
is
from
a
charming
nocturne
by
chopin
and
is
so
difficult
that
i
shall
have
to
play
it
over
fifty
times
or
else
i
shall
always
stumble
at
this
place
and
i
never
shall
know
the
nocturne
to
play
to
any
one
do
you
think
it
is
beautiful
so
spiritual
and
original
i
can
tell
you
it
will
be
something
to
boast
of
when
i
have
accomplished
that
you
like
it
better
the
oftener
i
play
it
so
do
i
we
have
an
invitation
out
mother
has
a
great
deal
to
arrange
and
directions
to
give
we
shall
have
to
go
in
ten
minutes
i
must
rush
to
the
piano
though
i
am
in
rather
an
inconvenient
toilette
i
may
as
well
accustom
myself
to
play
in
it
i
shall
have
to
spend
three
hours
this
evening
without
any
music
well
to
make
up
for
it
i
will
occupy
myself
for
the
next
ten
minutes
with
an
exercise
for
this
obstinate
fourth
finger
though
it
is
pretty
dry
that
weak
finger
has
been
a
hindrance
to
many
a
fine
passage
and
scale
that
is
better
now
i
can
put
on
my
tight
gloves
suppose
i
should
put
on
the
left
glove
on
the
way
well
my
young
ladies
how
many
hours
do
you
think
all
those
minutes
would
make
in
a
year
but
i
hear
you
say
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
to
pick
up
all
those
stray
minutes
like
lost
pins
we
have
a
whole
hour
to
practise
every
day
when
nothing
prevents
exactly
when
nothing
prevents
i
will
now
tell
you
a
few
of
my
secrets
for
piano
performers
if
in
or
in
any
art
you
wish
to
attain
success
you
must
resolve
to
work
every
day
at
least
a
little
on
the
technique
sickness
and
other
unavoidable
interruptions
deprive
you
of
days
enough
practise
always
with
unexhausted
energy
the
result
will
be
tenfold
do
you
not
frequently
use
the
time
for
practising
when
you
have
already
been
at
work
studying
for
five
or
six
hours
have
you
then
strength
and
spirit
enough
to
practise
the
necessary
exercises
for
an
hour
or
more
and
to
study
your
carefully
and
attentively
as
your
teacher
instructed
you
is
not
your
mind
exhausted
and
are
not
your
hands
and
fingers
tired
and
stiff
with
writing
so
that
you
are
tempted
to
help
out
with
your
arms
and
elbows
which
is
worse
than
no
practice
at
all
but
my
dear
ladies
if
you
practise
properly
several
times
every
day
ten
minutes
at
a
time
your
strength
and
your
patience
are
usually
sufficient
for
it
and
if
you
are
obliged
to
omit
your
regular
hour
practice
you
have
at
any
rate
accomplished
something
with
your
ten
minutes
before
breakfast
or
before
dinner
or
at
any
leisure
moment
so
i
beg
of
you
let
me
have
my
minutes
practise
often
slowly
and
without
pedal
not
only
the
smaller
and
larger
études
but
also
your
pieces
in
that
way
you
gain
at
least
a
correct
healthy
mode
of
playing
which
is
the
foundation
of
beautiful
playing
do
you
do
this
when
neither
your
teacher
nor
your
father
or
mother
is
present
to
keep
watch
over
you
do
you
never
say
nobody
is
listening
do
you
take
enough
healthy
exercise
in
the
open
air
active
exercise
in
all
weather
makes
strong
enduring
piano
fingers
while
subsisting
on
results
in
sickly
nervous
feeble
playing
strong
healthy
fingers
are
only
too
essential
for
our
present
style
of
which
requires
such
extraordinary
execution
and
for
our
heavy
instruments
so
i
still
beg
for
the
minutes
your
walks
take
up
hours
enough
excessive
and
fatiguing
feminine
occupations
and
drawing
or
painting
are
by
no
means
consistent
with
an
earnest
practical
musical
education
not
only
because
both
those
occupations
require
so
much
time
but
because
they
deprive
the
fingers
of
the
requisite
pliability
and
dexterity
while
knitting
according
to
the
latest
discoveries
produces
an
unnatural
nervous
excitement
which
is
unfavorable
to
healthy
progress
in
music
i
at
least
in
my
instruction
on
the
piano
have
never
been
able
to
accomplish
much
with
ladies
who
are
devoted
to
knitting
crochet
and
embroidering
my
dear
ladies
you
who
have
been
born
in
fortunate
circumstances
and
have
been
educated
by
your
parents
without
regard
to
expense
should
at
least
allow
the
poor
girl
in
the
country
who
is
obliged
to
hide
her
talents
under
a
bushel
the
small
privilege
of
making
a
collar
for
your
mother
or
your
aunt
birthday
present
i
assure
you
your
mother
or
your
aunt
if
you
surprise
them
instead
with
a
fine
piano
performance
will
be
as
much
pleased
as
if
you
strained
your
eyes
and
bent
your
back
for
days
and
nights
over
the
and
now
as
regards
painting
painting
and
music
though
theoretically
so
nearly
related
agree
but
poorly
in
practice
at
least
if
you
are
in
earnest
about
either
you
say
painters
often
play
on
the
guitar
and
the
flute
that
may
be
true
i
will
allow
them
those
two
instruments
but
stands
on
a
different
footing
even
for
mere
amateurs
sweet
melodies
on
those
instruments
may
afford
an
agreeable
companionship
for
the
painter
in
his
rambles
through
the
woods
and
over
the
hills
but
should
be
the
friend
of
a
ennobled
by
the
elevating
enjoyment
of
lofty
therefore
i
beg
you
do
not
dissipate
your
powers
too
much
leave
the
art
of
painting
to
your
friends
who
are
either
without
talent
for
music
or
who
have
no
opportunity
to
study
it
our
short
lives
do
not
allow
the
successful
practice
of
several
arts
of
what
advantage
to
our
higher
culture
is
it
to
be
able
to
do
ten
things
tolerably
well
what
gain
for
the
future
for
humanity
or
for
the
true
happiness
of
the
individual
and
even
if
you
can
succeed
in
painting
something
which
scarcely
can
be
said
to
resemble
a
rose
of
what
advantage
is
it
when
we
have
so
many
real
roses
to
admire
my
dear
ladies
i
warn
you
generally
do
not
be
afraid
of
the
classical
heavy
music
especially
beethoven
if
you
desire
to
learn
from
it
only
or
chiefly
repose
lightness
facility
elasticity
graceful
delicate
playing
and
a
fine
touch
it
is
necessary
to
play
such
music
after
those
brilliant
qualities
have
already
been
to
a
certain
degree
acquired
by
mere
studies
and
appropriate
pieces
it
is
however
still
more
foolish
and
impractical
when
parents
who
perhaps
are
skilful
musicians
but
who
have
no
recollection
of
their
own
youth
hold
the
mistaken
opinion
that
their
children
ought
from
the
very
beginning
to
practise
and
play
only
fine
classical
music
in
order
that
the
children
ears
may
not
be
injured
by
false
progressions
by
insignificant
finger
exercises
and
by
easily
comprehensible
italian
airs
and
that
they
themselves
may
not
be
ruined
body
and
soul
gracious
heavens
how
much
pure
music
suited
to
the
piano
have
not
my
daughters
as
well
as
many
others
whom
i
have
brought
up
to
be
fine
performers
played
and
studied
such
for
instance
as
the
music
of
hünten
czerny
burgmüller
kalkbrenner
and
schmitt
herz
and
many
others
who
finds
fault
now
with
their
musical
culture
with
their
sound
taste
or
their
want
of
love
for
classical
music
what
a
long
road
a
child
has
to
travel
through
etudes
of
cramer
moscheles
and
chopin
before
he
comes
to
bach
clavichord
or
before
he
is
able
or
ought
even
to
study
beethoven
sonate
pathétique
it
is
not
well
though
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
times
to
condemn
without
experience
from
one
own
prejudiced
point
of
view
the
methods
which
those
skilled
in
their
business
have
for
years
successfully
tried
and
practised
it
is
possible
to
make
pupils
musical
in
the
above
way
but
they
will
be
only
dull
clumsy
bunglers
on
the
piano
not
fine
artists
who
alone
can
give
a
worthy
and
noble
interpretation
of
classical
music
i
desire
that
my
daughters
may
never
forget
my
instructions
sustained
by
the
experience
of
many
years
and
that
they
may
in
grateful
remembrance
of
their
father
and
teacher
repay
to
their
pupils
what
they
owe
to
him
but
i
see
among
my
audience
several
beginners
in
singing
and
i
beg
to
be
allowed
a
word
to
them
so
long
as
many
of
our
german
song
composers
consider
it
beneath
their
dignity
to
study
the
art
of
singing
in
the
old
italian
and
under
the
guidance
of
singing
masters
as
gluck
naumann
hasse
händel
haydn
mozart
salieri
winter
and
others
have
done
i
warn
you
to
take
care
of
your
tender
voices
which
are
so
easily
ruined
and
not
to
allow
yourselves
to
be
misled
by
ingenious
opinions
and
by
music
otherwise
good
the
loss
of
your
voices
follows
in
the
footsteps
of
modern
tortures
in
singing
as
you
may
see
sufficiently
in
all
our
theatres
or
indeed
may
experience
yourselves
in
numberless
german
songs
apply
also
to
singing
what
i
have
just
said
about
as
you
should
choose
for
the
piano
music
suited
to
the
piano
so
for
your
studies
in
singing
select
only
that
which
is
adapted
to
the
voice
under
the
guidance
of
prudent
and
educated
teachers
not
of
modern
voice
breakers
who
allow
you
to
scream
in
order
to
bring
out
the
voice
when
you
have
acquired
a
good
technique
when
your
attack
is
sure
and
a
certain
skilfulness
in
singing
has
been
developed
then
only
you
may
try
by
way
of
experiment
a
few
pieces
of
such
spirited
but
unskilled
song
composers
who
frequently
commit
sins
in
every
line
against
correct
representation
the
register
of
the
voice
the
breathings
the
pronunciation
and
a
hundred
other
things
look
around
and
see
who
sing
these
classical
songs
they
are
either
singers
who
do
not
know
what
singing
is
and
who
have
no
taste
for
it
which
in
consequence
of
their
education
they
never
can
have
or
those
who
no
longer
have
any
voice
and
accordingly
sing
every
thing
or
rather
declaim
it
because
they
can
not
sing
i
recommend
you
to
sing
to
mention
the
names
of
two
only
of
our
most
excellent
song
composers
the
charming
songs
of
fr
schubert
and
mendelssohn
who
in
constant
intercourse
with
the
most
judicious
masters
of
singing
in
vienna
and
italy
have
striven
constantly
to
compose
scientifically
and
have
at
the
same
time
produced
clever
songs
but
you
should
sing
them
not
too
often
or
too
many
of
them
singing
in
the
german
language
and
in
syllables
and
often
with
clumsy
melodies
requires
a
great
deal
of
voice
and
easily
leads
to
many
faults
and
to
a
false
manner
remember
how
strictly
jenny
lind
selected
for
performance
in
her
concerts
the
songs
of
schubert
mendelssohn
and
schumann
in
this
way
she
succeeded
in
winning
great
success
even
with
small
short
songs
finally
one
more
secret
for
performers
which
weighs
heavy
in
the
balance
you
ought
especially
if
you
have
not
received
good
early
instruction
to
acquire
a
habit
of
moving
the
fingers
very
frequently
at
every
convenient
opportunity
and
particularly
of
letting
them
fall
loosely
and
lightly
upon
any
hard
object
while
the
hand
lies
upon
something
firm
in
an
extended
position
you
must
accustom
yourselves
to
do
this
unconsciously
for
example
while
reading
at
table
or
while
listening
to
music
allow
your
hand
to
lie
upon
the
table
raise
the
fingers
and
let
them
fall
one
at
a
time
quite
independently
of
the
wrist
particularly
the
weak
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
which
require
to
be
used
a
hundred
times
more
than
the
others
if
you
wish
to
acquire
evenness
in
the
scales
if
it
attracts
attention
to
do
this
on
the
table
then
do
it
in
your
lap
or
with
one
hand
over
the
other
to
drum
with
your
fingers
and
stretch
your
hands
on
the
backs
of
other
people
is
not
often
practicable
and
is
not
necessary
that
was
only
pardoned
in
the
zealous
and
original
adolph
henselt
who
though
otherwise
such
a
modest
and
amiable
artist
even
now
in
petersburg
makes
himself
ridiculous
in
this
way
by
his
practice
of
finger
movements
now
you
perceive
the
reason
why
i
can
not
answer
the
question
which
has
been
asked
me
innumerable
times
how
much
do
your
daughters
practise
i
can
not
count
up
the
finger
movements
and
the
stray
ten
minutes
just
spoken
of
but
it
is
certain
that
they
practise
fewer
hours
in
the
day
than
many
thousands
who
learn
nothing
for
they
never
practise
and
never
have
practised
wrongly
but
always
correctly
and
advantageously
one
thing
more
after
my
experienced
watchful
eye
had
observed
in
our
circle
many
moving
fingers
in
consequence
of
my
lecture
a
distinguished
lady
of
vienna
whispered
in
my
ear
but
my
dear
herr
wieck
my
amelia
is
not
to
be
a
professional
player
i
only
want
her
to
learn
a
few
of
the
less
difficult
sonatas
of
beethoven
to
play
correctly
and
fluently
without
notes
my
dear
ladies
i
do
not
aim
with
you
at
any
thing
more
than
this
a
great
many
circumstances
must
combine
for
the
formation
of
fine
concert
performers
in
fact
the
whole
education
from
the
earliest
youth
must
have
reference
to
this
end
if
this
were
not
so
germany
especially
on
account
of
its
natural
musical
talent
would
be
able
annually
to
furnish
thousands
of
performers
has
my
lecture
been
too
long
i
ask
your
pardon
my
desire
to
make
myself
useful
to
you
must
be
my
excuse
if
i
can
not
dispose
of
such
an
extensive
subject
in
a
few
words
i
have
not
yet
exhausted
it
chapter
xii
thoughts
on
my
daughters
play
the
music
of
all
the
principal
composers
and
also
the
best
salon
music
limited
views
of
any
kind
are
injurious
to
art
it
is
as
great
a
mistake
to
play
only
beethoven
music
as
to
play
none
of
it
or
to
play
either
classical
or
salon
music
solely
if
a
teacher
confines
himself
to
the
study
of
the
first
a
good
technique
a
tolerably
sound
style
of
playing
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
generally
sufficient
to
produce
an
interpretation
in
most
respects
satisfactory
the
music
usually
compensates
for
a
style
which
may
be
according
to
circumstances
either
dry
cold
too
monotonous
or
too
strongly
shaded
and
even
for
an
indifferent
or
careless
touch
interest
in
the
composition
frequently
diverts
the
attention
of
even
the
best
player
from
a
thoroughly
correct
and
delicate
mode
of
execution
and
from
the
effort
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
composition
and
to
increase
its
appreciation
with
the
hearer
in
the
performance
of
classical
music
inspiration
that
is
the
revelation
of
an
artistic
nature
and
not
empty
affectation
can
be
expected
only
from
an
artist
and
not
from
a
pupil
therefore
with
more
advanced
pupils
i
take
up
in
my
lessons
in
connection
with
a
sonata
by
beethoven
a
nocturne
or
waltz
by
chopin
and
a
piece
by
heller
or
schulhoff
henselt
meyer
elegance
and
polish
a
certain
coquetry
nicety
delicacy
and
fine
shading
can
not
be
perfected
in
the
study
of
a
sonata
by
beethoven
for
which
however
the
latter
pieces
present
much
greater
opportunities
besides
this
variety
is
much
more
sustaining
to
the
learner
it
excites
his
interest
he
does
not
so
soon
become
weary
and
is
guarded
from
carelessness
his
artistic
knowledge
is
increased
and
he
is
agreeably
surprised
to
find
himself
able
to
perform
three
pieces
so
distinct
in
character
expression
can
not
be
taught
it
must
come
of
itself
but
when
are
we
to
look
for
it
when
the
stiff
fingers
are
fifty
or
sixty
years
old
and
the
expression
is
imprisoned
in
them
so
that
nothing
is
ever
to
be
heard
of
it
this
is
a
delusion
let
us
look
at
a
few
of
those
to
whom
expression
has
come
of
itself
plays
skilfully
and
correctly
but
his
expression
continues
crude
cold
monotonous
he
shows
too
pedantic
a
solicitude
about
mechanical
execution
and
strict
time
he
never
ventures
on
a
uses
too
little
shading
in
and
plays
the
too
heavily
and
without
regard
to
the
instrument
his
and
are
inappropriate
often
coarse
and
brought
in
at
unsuitable
places
and
his
they
are
tedious
indeed
but
miss
plays
differently
and
more
finely
truly
she
plays
differently
but
is
it
more
finely
do
you
like
this
gentle
violet
blue
this
sickly
paleness
these
rouged
falsehoods
at
the
expense
of
all
integrity
of
character
this
sweet
embellished
languishing
style
this
and
dismembering
of
the
musical
phrases
this
want
of
time
and
this
sentimental
trash
they
both
have
talent
but
their
expression
was
allowed
to
be
developed
of
itself
they
both
would
have
been
very
good
players
but
now
they
have
lost
all
taste
for
the
ideal
which
manifests
itself
in
the
domain
of
truth
beauty
and
simplicity
if
pupils
are
left
to
themselves
they
imitate
the
improper
and
erroneous
easily
and
skilfully
the
right
and
suitable
with
difficulty
and
certainly
unskilfully
even
the
little
fellow
who
can
hardly
speak
learns
to
use
naughty
abusive
words
more
quickly
and
easily
than
fine
noble
expressions
what
has
not
been
surprised
at
this
facility
and
what
good
old
aunt
has
not
laughed
at
it
but
you
say
it
is
not
right
to
force
the
feelings
of
others
that
is
quite
unnecessary
but
it
is
possible
to
rouse
the
feelings
of
others
to
guide
and
educate
them
without
prejudicing
their
individuality
of
feeling
and
without
restraining
or
disturbing
them
unless
they
are
on
the
wrong
path
who
has
not
listened
to
performers
and
singers
who
were
otherwise
musical
but
whose
sentiment
was
either
ridiculous
or
lamentable
it
is
generally
acknowledged
that
among
other
things
i
have
succeeded
more
or
less
with
all
my
scholars
in
the
attainment
of
a
fine
touch
people
desire
to
obtain
from
me
the
requisite
exercises
for
the
development
of
this
but
not
much
can
be
gained
from
these
the
important
thing
is
and
they
are
to
be
used
and
that
most
careful
attention
shall
be
paid
in
the
selection
of
other
études
and
pieces
in
order
that
nothing
shall
be
played
which
shall
endanger
the
confirmation
of
the
correct
touch
already
acquired
or
shall
undo
what
has
been
accomplished
in
the
lessons
as
i
have
said
before
it
does
not
depend
upon
much
practising
but
upon
correct
practising
and
that
the
pupils
shall
not
be
allowed
to
fall
into
errors
i
am
constantly
asked
how
many
hours
a
day
do
your
daughters
practise
if
the
number
of
hours
spent
in
practising
gives
the
measure
of
the
standing
of
a
then
my
daughters
are
among
the
most
insignificant
or
in
fact
should
not
belong
to
the
order
at
all
this
is
the
place
for
me
to
explain
myself
more
fully
with
regard
to
playing
with
a
loose
wrist
in
order
that
i
shall
not
be
misunderstood
the
tones
which
are
produced
with
a
loose
wrist
are
always
more
tender
and
more
attractive
have
a
fuller
sound
and
permit
more
delicate
shading
than
the
sharp
tones
without
body
which
are
thrown
or
fired
off
or
tapped
out
with
unendurable
rigidity
by
the
aid
of
the
arm
and
a
superior
technique
can
with
few
exceptions
be
more
quickly
and
favorably
acquired
in
this
way
than
when
the
elbows
are
required
to
contribute
their
power
i
do
not
however
censure
the
performance
of
many
who
execute
rapid
octave
passages
with
a
stiff
wrist
they
often
do
it
with
great
precision
in
the
most
rapid
forcibly
and
effectively
it
must
after
all
depend
upon
individual
peculiarities
whether
the
pupil
can
learn
better
and
more
quickly
to
play
such
passages
thus
or
with
a
loose
wrist
the
present
style
of
bravoura
playing
for
can
not
dispense
with
facility
in
octave
passages
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
it
i
will
now
consider
the
use
of
loose
and
independent
fingers
in
playing
generally
in
that
of
more
advanced
pupils
who
have
already
acquired
the
necessary
elementary
knowledge
the
fingers
must
be
set
upon
the
keys
with
a
certain
decision
firmness
quickness
and
vigor
and
must
obtain
a
command
over
the
otherwise
the
result
is
only
a
tame
colorless
uncertain
immature
style
of
playing
in
which
no
fine
no
poignant
or
sprightly
accentuation
can
be
produced
every
thoughtful
teacher
striving
for
the
best
result
must
however
take
care
that
this
shall
only
be
acquired
gradually
and
must
teach
it
with
a
constant
regard
to
individual
peculiarities
and
not
at
the
expense
of
beauty
of
performance
and
of
a
tender
agreeable
touch
it
is
a
mortifying
fact
for
many
critics
artists
composers
and
teachers
that
the
general
public
show
much
more
correct
judgment
and
appreciation
of
a
fine
noble
piano
performance
and
of
a
simple
pure
style
of
singing
and
also
understand
the
characteristics
of
the
performer
much
more
quickly
than
they
do
the
sensibility
and
appreciation
of
beauty
with
the
public
is
less
prejudiced
less
spurious
more
receptive
and
more
artless
its
perceptions
are
not
disturbed
by
theories
by
a
desire
to
criticise
and
many
other
secondary
matters
the
public
do
not
take
a
biassed
or
stilted
view
the
admiration
for
jenny
lind
is
a
striking
proof
of
this
as
is
also
the
appreciation
of
many
the
age
of
progress
announces
in
also
a
higher
beauty
than
has
hitherto
existed
now
i
demand
of
all
the
defenders
of
this
new
style
wherein
is
this
superior
beauty
supposed
to
consist
it
is
useless
to
talk
in
a
vague
way
about
a
beauty
which
no
one
can
explain
i
have
listened
to
the
playing
no
the
thrumming
and
stamping
of
many
of
these
champions
of
the
modern
style
of
beauty
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
according
to
my
way
of
reasoning
that
it
ought
to
be
called
a
higher
quite
different
inverted
beauty
a
deformed
beauty
repugnant
to
the
sensibilities
of
all
mankind
but
our
gifted
age
of
the
future
protests
against
such
cold
conservatism
the
period
of
piano
fury
which
i
have
lived
to
see
and
which
i
have
just
described
was
the
introduction
to
this
new
essay
only
a
feeble
attempt
and
a
preliminary
to
this
piano
future
should
this
senseless
raging
and
storming
upon
the
piano
where
not
one
idea
can
be
intelligently
expressed
in
a
this
abhorrent
and
rude
treatment
of
a
grand
concert
piano
combined
with
frightful
misuse
of
both
pedals
which
puts
the
hearer
into
agonies
of
horror
and
spasms
of
terror
ever
be
regarded
as
any
thing
but
a
return
to
barbarism
devoid
of
feeling
and
reason
this
is
to
be
called
music
music
of
the
future
the
beauty
of
the
future
style
truly
for
this
style
of
music
the
ears
must
be
differently
constructed
the
feelings
must
be
differently
constituted
and
a
different
nervous
system
must
be
created
for
this
again
we
shall
need
surgeons
who
lie
in
wait
in
the
background
with
the
throat
improvers
what
a
new
and
grand
field
of
operations
lies
open
to
them
our
age
produces
monsters
who
are
insensible
to
the
plainest
truths
and
who
fill
humanity
with
horror
political
excesses
have
hardly
ceased
when
still
greater
ones
must
be
repeated
in
the
world
of
music
but
comfort
yourselves
my
readers
these
isolated
instances
of
madness
these
last
convulsions
of
musical
insanity
with
however
much
arrogance
they
may
be
proclaimed
will
not
take
the
world
by
storm
the
time
will
come
when
no
audience
not
even
eager
possessors
of
complimentary
tickets
but
only
a
few
needy
hirelings
will
venture
to
endure
such
concert
performances
of
the
future
i
ought
to
express
myself
more
fully
with
regard
to
expression
in
it
is
difficult
to
perform
this
task
at
least
in
writing
for
it
can
more
easily
be
practically
explained
to
individual
learners
intelligent
teachers
who
are
inclined
to
understand
my
meaning
will
find
abundant
material
as
well
as
all
necessary
explanations
in
the
preceding
chapters
and
i
will
merely
say
that
a
teacher
who
is
endowed
with
the
qualities
which
i
have
designated
as
the
three
trifles
will
seek
to
excite
the
same
in
his
pupils
will
refine
and
cultivate
them
according
to
his
ability
with
disinterestedness
with
energy
and
with
perseverance
and
truth
and
beauty
will
everywhere
be
the
result
thus
he
will
remain
in
the
present
where
there
is
so
much
remaining
to
be
accomplished
these
three
trifles
certainly
do
not
have
their
root
in
folly
want
of
talent
and
madness
therefore
the
possessors
of
the
latter
must
look
to
the
future
and
proclaim
a
higher
that
is
an
inverted
beauty
for
piano
you
must
never
begin
to
learn
a
second
piece
until
you
have
entirely
conquered
the
first
you
ought
to
fix
your
eyes
very
carefully
on
the
notes
and
not
to
trust
to
memory
otherwise
you
will
never
learn
to
play
at
sight
in
order
to
avoid
the
habit
of
false
fingering
you
should
not
play
any
piece
which
is
not
marked
for
the
proper
fingers
you
should
learn
to
play
chords
and
skipping
notes
without
looking
at
the
keys
as
this
interferes
with
a
prompt
reading
of
the
notes
you
must
learn
to
count
nicely
in
playing
in
order
always
to
keep
strict
time
to
use
for
once
the
language
of
the
times
which
boldly
proclaims
such
things
as
these
belong
to
a
which
we
have
already
reached
i
wish
that
the
musicians
of
the
future
may
as
happily
reach
their
not
by
hollow
phrases
and
flourishes
and
the
threshing
of
empty
straws
but
by
practical
successful
efforts
and
striving
for
that
which
is
better
what
is
the
value
of
your
method
in
the
instruction
of
pupils
who
have
for
years
played
many
pieces
from
notes
but
have
played
them
badly
and
whom
we
are
called
upon
to
lead
into
a
better
way
of
playing
a
reply
to
this
frequent
inquiry
can
be
found
in
my
first
chapter
above
all
things
let
the
notes
which
have
already
been
played
be
laid
aside
for
a
long
time
for
a
mistaken
style
of
playing
these
has
become
so
confirmed
that
to
improve
them
is
hopeless
and
the
tottering
edifice
must
fall
to
the
ground
first
improve
the
touch
help
to
acquire
a
better
and
more
connected
scale
teach
the
formation
of
different
cadences
on
the
dominant
and
and
the
construction
of
various
passages
on
the
chord
of
the
diminished
seventh
to
be
played
with
correct
even
and
quiet
fingering
and
and
pay
strict
attention
to
the
use
of
loose
fingers
and
a
loose
wrist
and
allow
no
inattentive
playing
you
may
soon
take
up
with
these
studies
some
entirely
unfamiliar
piece
of
music
suited
to
the
capacity
of
the
pupil
it
is
not
possible
or
desirable
to
attempt
to
make
a
sudden
and
thorough
change
with
such
pupils
even
if
they
should
show
the
best
intentions
and
docility
you
should
select
a
light
easy
piece
of
salon
music
but
of
a
nature
well
adapted
to
the
piano
which
shall
not
be
wearisome
to
the
pupil
and
in
the
improved
performance
of
which
he
will
take
pleasure
but
if
you
still
find
that
he
falls
into
the
old
faulty
manner
of
playing
and
that
the
recently
acquired
technique
which
has
not
yet
become
habitual
is
endangered
by
it
lay
this
too
aside
and
take
instead
some
appropriate
étude
or
perhaps
a
little
prelude
by
bach
if
in
the
place
of
these
you
choose
for
instruction
a
ponderous
sonata
in
which
the
music
would
distract
the
attention
of
the
pupil
from
the
improved
technique
you
give
up
the
most
important
aim
of
your
instruction
and
occupy
yourself
with
secondary
matters
you
will
censure
and
instruct
in
vain
and
will
never
attain
success
you
must
consider
reflect
and
give
your
mind
to
the
peculiar
needs
of
the
pupil
and
you
must
teach
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
psychology
you
will
succeed
after
a
while
but
precipitation
compulsion
and
disputes
are
useless
the
improvement
of
a
soprano
voice
ruined
by
requires
prudence
patience
calmness
and
modesty
and
a
character
of
a
high
type
generally
it
is
also
a
very
thankless
task
and
success
is
rare
while
on
the
piano
a
fair
result
may
always
be
accomplished
i
return
once
more
to
the
subject
so
frequently
discussed
that
i
may
try
to
relieve
the
universal
difficulty
of
our
lady
pianists
i
have
heard
much
playing
of
late
in
parties
both
small
and
large
on
and
on
pianos
on
those
with
which
the
performer
was
familiar
and
on
those
to
which
she
was
unaccustomed
from
the
timid
and
the
from
ladies
of
various
ages
possessed
of
more
or
of
less
talent
and
in
various
cities
the
result
was
always
the
same
we
hear
from
the
ladies
that
they
could
play
their
pieces
at
home
before
their
parents
or
their
teachers
but
this
is
never
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
save
their
hearers
from
weariness
anxiety
and
all
sorts
of
embarrassment
my
honored
ladies
you
play
over
and
over
again
two
mazourkas
two
waltzes
two
nocturnes
and
the
funeral
march
of
chopin
the
mazourka
and
other
pieces
by
schulhoff
the
and
the
tremolo
by
carl
meyer
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
which
you
might
be
able
to
master
these
pieces
pretty
well
but
instead
of
this
you
yourselves
are
mastered
you
become
embarrassed
and
your
hearers
still
more
so
the
affair
ends
with
apologies
on
both
sides
with
equivocal
compliments
with
encouragement
to
continue
in
the
same
course
with
acknowledgment
of
fine
hands
for
the
piano
with
uneasy
forced
congratulations
to
the
parents
and
teacher
but
it
is
always
a
happy
moment
when
the
fatal
soirée
is
over
the
next
day
i
am
forced
to
sigh
again
over
the
same
miserable
poorly
and
tediously
performed
funeral
march
of
chopin
and
over
the
timorous
b
major
mazourka
by
schulhoff
the
left
hand
is
always
left
in
the
lurch
in
the
difficult
skipping
basses
of
this
piece
and
in
others
of
the
present
style
which
are
rich
in
harmony
and
modulations
the
bass
part
in
this
piece
is
apt
to
suffer
from
timid
and
false
tones
frequently
the
fundamental
tone
is
omitted
or
the
little
finger
remains
resting
upon
it
instead
of
giving
the
eighth
note
with
a
crisp
elastic
and
sprightly
touch
and
the
chords
are
tame
and
incomplete
you
do
not
give
them
their
full
value
you
leave
them
too
quickly
because
you
are
afraid
of
not
striking
the
next
low
note
quickly
enough
but
on
the
other
hand
you
do
not
strike
it
at
all
and
one
missing
tone
brings
another
one
after
it
the
right
hand
being
the
most
skilful
is
supposed
to
play
with
expression
and
really
does
so
but
this
only
makes
the
performance
the
worse
the
fundamental
tone
is
wanting
and
you
are
led
to
make
a
mistake
in
the
skip
and
strike
the
wrong
key
finally
the
whole
thing
is
ended
in
terror
i
have
an
uneasy
night
i
dream
of
your
fine
hands
but
the
false
and
the
weak
notes
start
up
between
like
strange
spectres
or
will
o
the
wisps
and
i
wake
with
the
headache
instead
of
with
pleasant
memories
allow
me
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
play
and
practise
the
bass
part
a
great
deal
and
very
often
first
slowly
then
quicker
during
one
or
two
weeks
before
playing
the
right
hand
with
it
in
order
that
you
may
give
your
whole
attention
to
playing
the
bass
correctly
delicately
and
surely
even
when
you
can
get
through
the
mazourka
tolerably
well
you
must
not
think
on
that
account
that
you
will
be
able
to
play
it
in
company
under
trying
circumstances
you
ought
to
be
able
to
play
the
piece
by
yourself
with
ease
very
frequently
perfectly
and
distinctly
and
in
very
rapid
before
you
trust
yourself
to
perform
it
even
slowly
in
company
at
least
practise
the
more
difficult
passages
for
the
right
hand
very
frequently
particularly
the
difficult
and
bold
conclusion
that
it
may
not
strike
the
hearer
as
rough
weak
tame
or
hurried
it
is
an
old
rule
if
you
begin
well
and
end
well
all
is
well
you
ought
to
practise
the
skipping
bass
over
and
over
again
by
itself
otherwise
it
will
not
go
an
incorrect
or
deficient
bass
without
depth
of
tone
and
without
accentuation
ruins
every
thing
even
the
good
temper
of
the
hearer
one
thing
more
you
know
very
well
chopin
nocturne
in
e
flat
and
have
played
it
among
other
things
for
the
last
four
weeks
suddenly
you
are
called
upon
to
play
in
company
you
choose
this
nocturne
because
you
have
played
it
nearly
every
day
for
four
weeks
but
alas
the
piano
fiends
have
come
to
confuse
you
you
strike
a
false
bass
note
and
at
the
modulation
the
weak
little
finger
touches
too
feebly
bah
the
fundamental
tone
is
wanting
you
are
frightened
and
grow
still
more
so
your
musical
aunt
is
frightened
also
the
blood
rushes
to
your
teacher
face
and
i
mutter
to
myself
toujours
la
the
present
style
of
skipping
basses
requires
a
great
deal
of
practice
and
perfect
security
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
know
the
piece
by
heart
in
order
to
give
your
whole
attention
to
the
left
hand
it
is
also
essential
that
you
shall
have
acquired
a
clear
sound
touch
otherwise
you
can
not
give
a
delicate
accent
and
shading
you
must
never
allow
yourself
previous
to
play
those
pieces
of
music
in
company
in
which
an
elegant
mode
of
execution
is
otherwise
you
will
be
taken
by
surprise
by
unexpected
difficulties
you
must
always
pay
special
attention
to
the
fundamental
tones
even
if
there
should
be
imperfections
elsewhere
where
one
fault
is
less
important
than
another
of
two
evils
choose
the
least
you
have
been
playing
now
for
six
or
eight
years
are
you
repaid
for
the
trouble
if
it
only
enables
you
to
prepare
embarrassments
for
others
you
are
not
willing
to
play
easy
insignificant
pieces
and
such
pieces
as
you
choose
require
industry
earnestness
and
perseverance
young
ladies
it
is
easy
to
discover
the
character
of
a
person
from
his
manner
of
standing
walking
moving
and
speaking
from
the
way
he
bows
puts
on
and
takes
off
his
hat
or
the
arrangements
of
the
household
and
we
seldom
are
in
error
about
it
it
is
also
possible
to
infer
beforehand
how
you
will
play
and
what
sort
of
a
performance
you
will
give
from
the
manner
in
which
you
take
your
seat
at
the
piano
you
sidle
up
to
the
piano
lazily
bent
over
in
a
constrained
manner
in
your
embarrassment
you
place
yourself
before
the
or
instead
of
before
you
sit
unsteadily
either
too
high
or
too
low
only
half
on
the
seat
leaning
either
too
much
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
in
a
word
as
if
you
did
not
belong
to
the
fatal
your
manner
awakens
no
confidence
and
in
this
way
announces
that
you
have
none
yourself
how
do
you
expect
to
exercise
control
over
a
grand
seven
octave
piano
if
you
do
not
sit
exactly
in
the
middle
with
the
body
erect
and
the
feet
on
the
two
pedals
you
are
not
willing
to
look
the
friend
straight
in
the
face
with
whom
you
are
to
carry
on
a
friendly
confidential
discourse
even
if
your
attitude
and
bearing
were
not
so
injurious
and
dangerous
for
the
performer
as
it
is
still
propriety
and
good
sense
would
require
that
you
should
excite
the
confidence
of
your
hearers
in
you
and
in
your
playing
by
a
correct
position
of
the
body
and
by
a
certain
decision
and
resolution
and
should
prepare
him
to
form
a
good
opinion
of
you
there
are
indeed
many
who
think
they
give
evidence
of
genius
by
throwing
themselves
on
to
the
in
a
slovenly
lounging
manner
and
try
to
show
in
this
way
their
superiority
to
a
painstaking
performance
and
to
make
up
by
a
showy
for
what
is
wanting
in
their
playing
you
are
however
a
stranger
to
such
assertion
of
superior
genius
and
to
such
an
expression
of
intensity
of
feeling
you
do
it
only
from
embarrassment
and
from
a
modest
want
of
confidence
in
your
own
powers
which
is
quite
unnecessary
our
great
masters
such
as
field
hummel
moscheles
mendelssohn
and
others
had
no
taste
for
such
improprieties
for
such
manifestations
of
genius
they
applied
themselves
to
their
task
with
earnest
devotion
and
with
respect
for
the
public
chapter
xiii
on
musical
talent
a
large
and
varied
experience
is
required
for
a
correct
estimate
of
musical
talent
in
the
young
do
not
be
deceived
by
the
early
evidences
of
talent
for
instance
interest
in
melodies
correct
feeling
for
time
an
instinct
for
accenting
the
important
notes
inclination
for
some
peculiar
though
often
perverted
style
of
performance
quick
apprehension
a
natural
aptitude
for
playing
a
nice
hearing
animation
rapid
progress
docility
superficial
gayety
even
if
all
or
a
part
of
these
traits
are
observable
in
early
youth
they
must
not
excite
too
sanguine
hopes
i
have
often
met
with
such
phenomena
and
have
been
called
upon
to
educate
such
little
piano
prodigies
they
advanced
quite
rapidly
and
understood
every
thing
readily
if
i
did
not
make
too
much
demand
upon
their
wavering
attention
i
dreamed
of
the
extraordinary
surprises
that
these
marvellous
youths
would
create
at
twelve
or
fourteen
years
of
age
but
the
fulfilment
of
my
ideal
i
saw
only
in
my
mind
eye
for
just
then
the
improvement
came
to
a
sudden
a
fatal
moment
when
the
teacher
is
perplexed
to
know
what
to
do
next
the
musical
nature
seemed
to
have
exhausted
itself
to
have
itself
the
pupil
even
felt
this
his
interest
in
the
piano
and
in
music
generally
grew
feeble
his
playing
suddenly
became
careless
powerless
spiritless
he
played
with
evident
indifference
out
into
the
fresh
air
into
open
natural
scenes
now
for
a
journey
i
allowed
a
long
vacation
to
intervene
the
pupil
was
quite
contented
and
had
no
desire
for
the
piano
or
if
so
only
jingled
a
little
at
last
we
began
again
but
we
spent
our
time
without
much
result
he
was
nevertheless
still
musical
but
he
finally
ranked
at
best
with
dozens
of
other
players
and
ended
as
an
ordinary
piano
teacher
similar
halts
in
progress
occur
in
fact
with
all
pupils
especially
with
female
scholars
but
they
are
not
usually
so
lasting
so
discouraging
or
so
significant
of
exhaustion
they
are
surmounted
after
a
short
interval
by
the
discontinuance
of
serious
musical
studies
perhaps
by
reading
at
sight
for
a
while
by
occupying
the
pupil
for
a
time
with
the
theory
or
with
attempts
at
composition
or
improvisation
by
allowing
him
to
listen
to
other
players
better
or
worse
by
giving
him
interesting
books
to
read
by
making
him
acquainted
with
beethoven
or
in
other
ways
from
our
observation
of
such
sudden
changes
and
of
the
frequent
occurrence
of
unskilful
management
we
can
explain
the
sudden
appearance
and
equally
sudden
disappearance
of
innumerable
infant
prodigies
in
our
age
who
have
excited
hopes
and
have
almost
all
of
them
been
lost
or
have
passed
out
of
sight
and
resulted
in
nothing
of
value
i
have
always
preferred
a
gradual
even
a
slow
development
step
by
step
which
often
made
no
apparent
progress
but
which
still
proceeded
with
a
certain
constancy
and
with
deliberation
and
which
was
combined
with
dreamy
sensibility
and
a
musical
instinct
requiring
slow
awakening
and
even
with
a
certain
flightiness
one
for
which
the
patient
labor
and
perseverance
of
six
years
or
more
was
required
and
where
childishness
allowed
no
encouragement
to
sordid
speculations
for
the
future
in
such
cases
when
my
instructions
were
not
disturbed
by
untoward
circumstances
the
result
has
always
been
a
desirable
one
but
how
much
patience
and
perseverance
has
this
required
i
have
reflected
much
and
have
often
spoken
both
seriously
and
playfully
of
the
slow
advancement
of
my
pupils
allow
me
here
to
describe
five
phases
or
stages
of
human
development
in
the
first
two
or
three
years
man
is
far
behind
the
animal
whose
quick
instinct
distinguishes
the
good
from
the
bad
the
useful
from
the
injurious
the
child
without
hesitation
rolls
off
the
table
or
knocks
his
brains
out
or
destroys
himself
with
poisonous
herbs
or
arsenic
nevertheless
let
him
at
that
age
hear
plenty
of
pure
sounds
music
singing
he
will
soon
learn
to
listen
like
the
little
black
poodle
he
already
has
a
dim
suspicion
that
other
things
exist
which
are
not
evil
besides
mamma
papa
the
nurse
the
doll
and
the
sound
of
words
from
the
fourth
to
the
seventh
year
instinct
is
developed
which
in
the
animal
surprises
the
observer
in
the
first
two
weeks
of
life
now
we
should
begin
with
the
technique
at
least
with
the
correct
movement
of
the
fingers
upon
the
table
the
child
should
be
told
that
he
shall
soon
produce
the
pleasant
tones
which
he
has
been
accustomed
to
hear
from
infancy
but
that
for
this
a
quick
and
quiet
movement
of
the
fingers
is
necessary
which
must
be
acquired
by
daily
practice
this
is
entirely
in
accordance
with
nature
for
man
is
appointed
to
learn
let
the
child
lay
his
hand
upon
the
table
and
knock
upon
it
with
the
first
finger
the
thumb
stretched
out
without
using
the
muscles
of
the
arm
then
with
the
second
third
and
fourth
fingers
in
an
almost
perpendicular
position
and
with
the
fifth
finger
extended
then
let
him
strike
a
third
with
the
first
and
third
fingers
together
a
fourth
with
the
first
and
fourth
fingers
first
with
the
right
hand
then
with
the
left
hand
and
afterwards
with
both
together
from
the
seventh
to
the
twelfth
year
at
this
stage
unruliness
makes
its
appearance
and
at
the
same
time
the
notes
but
not
beethoven
that
would
indeed
be
an
unfortunate
musical
indulgence
violent
outbreaks
of
untamed
strength
unexpected
freaks
alternations
of
rude
instinct
and
quick
intelligence
of
lofty
fancy
and
artless
simplicity
disobedience
much
appetite
all
these
must
be
shaped
and
made
subservient
to
the
object
we
have
in
view
do
you
understand
me
gentlemen
excellent
parents
who
desire
to
see
the
ripe
fruits
of
your
care
and
labor
have
patience
first
there
comes
the
foreshadowing
of
manhood
a
very
interesting
period
the
youth
steps
out
of
the
animal
into
the
human
kingdom
and
often
is
unable
to
forget
his
earlier
condition
but
revels
in
sweet
remembrance
of
it
try
now
gently
and
timidly
beethoven
chopin
schumann
and
the
like
this
extraordinary
being
animal
and
human
requires
to
be
awakened
excited
and
to
have
the
imagination
aroused
and
above
all
requires
the
most
careful
guidance
it
is
necessary
to
stir
and
agitate
the
nature
in
order
that
reflection
conscience
the
sensibilities
of
the
soul
feeling
creative
power
and
all
inward
conditions
shall
be
developed
and
that
out
of
this
chaos
shall
be
brought
a
clear
and
beautiful
order
the
adult
man
in
his
eighteenth
year
the
year
however
varies
with
individuals
and
can
be
modified
at
will
if
i
should
enter
into
details
of
the
four
earlier
stages
of
humanity
and
treat
in
addition
of
the
adult
man
i
should
be
obliged
to
write
a
philosophical
work
on
the
subject
and
that
might
not
be
entertaining
i
should
be
obliged
to
beg
your
indulgence
for
a
tedious
book
and
my
daughters
certainly
would
not
thank
me
for
it
they
are
very
sensitive
but
i
must
nevertheless
secretly
whisper
in
your
ear
that
my
daughters
like
the
daughters
of
many
others
have
been
carried
through
these
five
stages
in
the
most
careful
and
thorough
manner
i
ought
to
know
that
best
here
you
have
the
answer
to
many
strange
questions
i
warn
pianists
and
others
also
in
playing
against
any
showy
and
unsuitable
display
why
should
you
wish
to
attract
attention
and
to
create
an
effect
by
foppishness
and
all
sorts
of
grimaces
or
by
curious
and
marvellous
exhibitions
of
you
have
only
to
play
musically
and
beautifully
and
to
deport
yourselves
with
modesty
and
propriety
direct
your
whole
attention
to
the
business
in
hand
that
is
to
your
performance
and
endeavor
to
secure
for
it
the
interest
of
the
public
who
are
so
easily
rendered
inattentive
we
want
no
more
public
performances
from
eccentric
geniuses
do
not
devote
yourself
exclusively
to
pieces
calculated
to
show
the
skill
of
the
performer
why
desire
always
to
show
off
your
power
in
octave
passages
your
trills
your
facility
in
skips
your
unprecedented
stretches
or
other
fantastic
feats
you
only
produce
weariness
satiety
and
disgust
or
at
least
you
make
yourselves
ridiculous
play
good
music
in
a
musical
and
rational
manner
the
public
are
tired
of
hearing
potpourris
made
up
of
odds
and
ends
tedious
etudes
rhapsodies
fantasias
without
fancy
dismal
monotonies
and
endless
cheap
silly
cadences
that
mean
nothing
learn
to
understand
the
age
and
the
world
in
which
you
live
do
not
make
yourselves
ridiculous
by
new
inventions
in
i
mention
for
example
one
of
the
most
foolish
affectations
of
modern
times
you
try
to
quiver
on
a
note
just
as
violin
and
players
are
unfortunately
too
much
inclined
to
do
do
not
expose
yourselves
to
the
derision
of
every
apprentice
in
piano
manufacture
have
you
no
understanding
of
the
construction
of
the
piano
you
have
played
upon
it
or
have
some
of
you
stormed
upon
it
for
the
last
ten
years
and
yet
you
have
not
taken
pains
to
obtain
even
a
superficial
acquaintance
with
its
mechanism
the
hammer
which
by
its
stroke
upon
the
string
has
produced
the
sound
falls
immediately
when
the
tone
resounds
and
after
that
you
may
caress
the
key
which
has
set
the
hammer
in
motion
fidget
round
on
it
as
much
as
you
please
and
stagger
up
and
down
over
it
in
your
intoxicated
passion
no
more
sound
is
to
be
brought
out
from
it
with
all
your
trembling
and
quivering
it
is
only
the
public
who
are
quivering
with
laughter
at
your
absurdity
give
up
the
practice
of
extreme
stretches
widely
dispersed
harmonies
may
sometimes
produce
a
good
effect
but
not
by
too
frequent
and
too
eager
an
employment
of
them
at
every
opportunity
even
the
greatest
beauties
in
art
can
lead
to
mannerism
and
this
again
to
art
should
be
and
you
must
never
produce
the
impression
that
you
are
inclined
to
make
the
means
an
end
i
beg
you
to
reflect
that
too
much
practice
of
very
wide
stretches
enfeebles
the
muscles
and
the
power
of
the
hand
and
fingers
endangers
an
even
sound
touch
and
makes
the
best
style
of
playing
a
doubtful
acquisition
teachers
ought
therefore
to
use
great
prudence
and
only
gradually
to
permit
their
pupils
especially
young
girls
to
practise
great
extensions
and
wide
stretches
to
learn
to
be
able
to
strike
ten
notes
is
quite
enough
before
you
perform
a
piece
play
a
few
suitable
chords
and
a
few
appropriate
passages
or
scales
up
and
down
but
play
no
stupid
trash
such
as
i
have
heard
from
many
in
order
to
try
whether
the
condition
of
the
instrument
presents
any
unexpected
difficulties
try
carefully
also
the
unavoidable
pedal
a
creaking
rattling
grating
pedal
is
a
frightful
annoyance
i
wonder
if
the
piano
of
the
future
is
to
suffer
from
this
also
chopin
funeral
march
with
obligato
accompaniment
of
a
squeaking
pedal
sentiment
even
although
the
omissions
and
mistakes
in
the
bass
do
not
occur
alas
who
can
describe
the
effect
of
this
melancholy
march
i
have
written
a
special
article
on
the
manner
of
sitting
at
the
piano
and
i
will
refer
you
once
more
to
that
use
no
mechanical
aids
in
practising
not
even
the
dumb
although
with
very
careful
use
that
is
not
without
value
strength
will
come
with
time
do
not
try
to
hurry
nature
the
table
is
the
best
dumb
as
i
have
already
explained
the
is
also
unnecessary
its
value
is
compensated
by
its
disadvantages
do
not
let
your
hearers
crowd
too
near
while
you
are
playing
do
not
play
the
same
piece
you
may
be
justified
in
breaking
off
in
the
midst
of
a
piece
if
there
is
loud
and
continuous
talking
i
hope
you
will
give
me
the
honor
of
your
company
again
at
my
soirées
i
am
no
writer
of
comedies
but
i
can
tell
you
a
great
deal
that
is
interesting
and
amusing
which
i
have
myself
experienced
chapter
xiv
extravagances
in
singing
and
an
evening
party
at
mr
gold
dramatis
personæ
gold
banker
fond
of
music
gold
sings
and
is
an
invalid
silver
formerly
a
singer
with
strauss
pious
friend
of
the
family
a
musical
impostor
and
a
hypocrite
generally
mr
forte
foreign
piano
virtuoso
of
weak
nerves
dominie
emma
gold
has
just
been
singing
in
the
modern
italian
manner
suddenly
alternating
exaggerated
high
and
low
tones
given
in
a
jerking
manner
with
inaudible
in
the
throat
and
quavering
on
every
note
with
many
ornaments
and
always
a
quarter
of
a
tone
too
flat
she
sang
all
the
four
verses
of
fondly
i
think
of
thee
by
dominie
will
you
not
go
on
gold
the
piano
is
a
little
too
high
and
you
are
obliged
to
accustom
yourself
a
little
to
it
gold
i
can
not
sing
any
more
that
beautiful
song
has
taken
such
hold
of
me
and
i
feel
so
badly
to
mr
forte
did
not
accompany
me
well
either
sometimes
he
did
not
come
in
right
and
played
too
feebly
and
sometimes
he
improvised
too
much
in
playing
and
overpowered
my
voice
which
is
a
little
weak
just
now
dominie
to
what
an
evening
of
singing
oh
dear
gold
has
been
earnestly
talking
about
stocks
all
the
evening
in
an
adjoining
room
rushes
in
but
rather
late
after
the
close
of
the
song
and
impetuously
presses
his
wife
marvellous
magnificent
delicious
wonderful
my
dear
you
are
in
excellent
voice
this
evening
if
jenny
lind
could
only
have
heard
you
pious
charming
superb
how
touching
there
is
a
religious
character
in
this
piece
something
holy
about
it
i
beg
of
you
do
sing
that
air
by
voss
true
happiness
that
will
make
our
enjoyment
complete
it
is
truly
ravishing
there
is
something
divine
in
singing
and
your
expression
your
feeling
madam
you
give
yourself
up
so
entirely
to
the
composition
gold
has
already
taken
up
true
happiness
and
can
hardly
wait
while
mr
forte
murmurs
off
the
introduction
quite
after
his
own
fancy
with
a
sentimental
pious
drops
a
tear
at
the
close
of
the
introduction
the
four
bars
of
which
have
been
transformed
into
eight
bars
by
the
great
during
the
tremulous
affected
performance
of
true
happiness
pious
rolls
up
his
moistened
eyes
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
verse
where
the
accompanist
once
more
gives
the
reins
to
his
fancy
he
says
i
am
speechless
i
can
not
find
words
to
express
my
emotion
dominie
to
that
you
may
call
forged
sentiment
the
counterfeit
of
feeling
you
hear
now
how
one
ought
to
sing
for
an
earnest
true
musician
such
a
warmth
in
singing
is
only
empty
affectation
disgusting
sentimental
rubbish
and
hollow
dissimulation
you
will
however
frequently
meet
with
such
amateur
infelicities
gold
has
finished
singing
all
the
verses
of
true
happiness
and
seems
now
to
have
almost
entirely
recovered
gold
continues
to
converse
about
stocks
in
the
adjoining
room
dominie
remains
with
emma
at
the
end
of
the
parlor
depressed
and
mr
forte
his
seat
at
the
piano
and
says
in
french
to
madam
you
have
reached
the
climax
of
the
beautiful
in
music
i
count
it
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
artistic
tour
to
be
allowed
to
breathe
out
my
soul
at
the
piano
in
the
presence
of
one
like
yourself
what
a
loss
that
your
position
must
prevent
you
from
elevating
the
german
opera
to
its
former
greatness
as
its
most
radiant
star
gold
this
time
quite
i
must
confess
that
jenny
lind
never
quite
satisfied
me
when
she
was
here
she
is
and
must
always
remain
a
swede
utterly
cold
if
she
had
been
educated
here
she
would
have
listened
to
more
passionate
models
than
in
stockholm
and
that
would
have
given
the
true
direction
to
her
sensibility
mr
forte
you
are
quite
right
you
have
a
just
estimate
of
her
in
paris
where
she
might
have
heard
such
examples
she
lived
in
perfect
retirement
i
was
giving
concerts
there
at
the
time
but
she
refused
to
sing
in
my
concerts
and
therefore
she
did
not
even
hear
me
silver
the
excitement
of
the
singing
has
at
length
do
you
feel
inclined
now
madam
to
execute
with
me
the
duet
from
the
creation
between
adam
and
eve
gold
here
is
the
creation
but
we
will
sing
it
by
and
by
mr
forte
is
just
going
to
play
us
his
latest
composition
for
the
left
hand
and
some
of
the
music
of
that
romantic
deeply
sensitive
chopin
gold
in
from
his
stock
oh
yes
chopin
b
major
mazourka
that
was
also
played
at
my
house
by
henselt
thalberg
and
dreyschock
oh
it
is
touching
all
silver
dominie
and
oh
how
touching
dominie
his
if
he
plays
it
in
the
same
manner
in
which
he
accompanied
true
happiness
you
will
hear
how
this
mazourka
should
be
played
it
by
the
way
is
not
at
all
it
gives
quite
boldly
the
polish
dance
rhythm
as
it
is
improvised
by
the
peasants
in
that
country
but
it
is
however
idealized
after
manner
forte
plays
several
perilous
runs
up
and
down
with
various
octave
passages
all
the
time
keeping
his
foot
on
the
pedal
and
connects
with
these
immediately
and
without
a
pause
the
mazourka
which
he
commences
he
played
it
without
regard
to
time
or
rhythm
but
with
a
constant
and
unmusical
jerks
a
few
notes
were
murmured
indistinctly
and
played
very
then
suddenly
a
few
notes
were
struck
very
rapidly
and
with
great
force
so
that
the
strings
rattled
and
the
final
b
major
chord
cost
the
life
of
one
gold
excellent
bravissimo
what
a
comprehension
of
the
piece
such
artistic
performances
make
one
even
forget
the
gold
you
agitate
my
inmost
nerves
the
english
poet
pope
holds
that
no
created
man
can
penetrate
the
secrets
of
nature
but
you
have
penetrated
the
secrets
of
my
soul
now
do
play
at
once
the
f
sharp
minor
mazourka
opus
pious
what
a
musical
evening
gold
has
prepared
for
us
what
sublime
sorrow
lies
in
this
production
silver
what
would
father
strauss
say
to
this
affected
unmusical
performance
that
bids
defiance
to
all
good
taste
dominie
gold
it
would
be
well
to
send
for
the
tuner
to
replace
this
broken
b
string
the
next
one
will
break
soon
for
it
is
already
cracked
and
its
tone
is
fallen
mr
forte
a
superior
it
is
of
no
consequence
that
frequently
happens
to
me
but
i
never
mind
it
the
piano
is
a
where
there
must
be
sacrifices
dominie
to
he
thinks
that
if
the
sound
is
not
musical
still
it
makes
a
noise
and
tones
out
of
tune
produce
more
effect
than
those
that
are
pure
emma
where
did
he
learn
dominie
my
child
he
has
not
it
that
is
genius
which
comes
of
itself
instruction
would
have
fettered
his
genius
and
then
he
would
have
played
distinctly
correctly
unaffectedly
and
in
time
but
that
would
be
too
much
like
the
style
of
an
amateur
this
uncontrolled
which
pays
no
regard
to
time
is
called
the
soaring
of
genius
forte
storms
through
various
unconnected
chords
with
the
greatest
rapidity
with
the
pedal
raised
and
passes
without
pause
to
the
f
sharp
minor
mazourka
he
accents
vehemently
divides
one
bar
and
gives
it
two
extra
quarter
notes
and
from
the
next
bar
he
omits
a
quarter
note
and
continues
in
this
manner
with
extreme
till
he
reaches
the
close
and
then
after
a
few
desperate
chords
of
the
diminished
seventh
he
connects
with
it
liszt
transcription
of
schubert
serenade
in
d
minor
the
second
string
of
the
b
snaps
with
a
rattle
and
there
ensues
a
general
whispering
whether
the
piece
is
by
mendelssohn
or
döhler
or
beethoven
or
proch
or
schumann
until
finally
silver
mentions
schubert
serenade
mr
forte
concludes
with
the
soft
pedal
which
in
his
inspired
moments
he
had
already
made
frequent
use
dominie
you
should
never
play
in
company
without
mentioning
previously
what
you
are
going
to
perform
you
observe
as
soon
as
the
serenade
was
mentioned
it
put
a
stop
to
the
guessing
all
silver
and
what
a
glorious
performance
what
an
artistic
treat
gold
what
spirituality
in
his
playing
silver
mr
forte
for
i
noticed
in
the
serenade
you
made
only
one
bar
of
the
two
where
it
modulates
to
f
major
in
your
rapid
playing
of
the
passage
was
that
accidental
emma
he
ought
to
have
played
a
little
slower
just
there
mr
forte
in
such
beautiful
passages
every
thing
must
be
left
to
the
suggestion
of
one
feelings
perhaps
another
time
i
may
make
three
bars
just
as
inspiration
and
genius
may
intimate
those
are
æsthetic
surprises
henselt
moscheles
thalberg
and
clara
wieck
do
not
execute
in
that
manner
and
consequently
can
produce
no
effect
and
do
not
travel
dominie
i
hope
that
your
natural
taste
and
your
musical
education
will
preserve
you
from
such
preposterous
extravagances
emma
such
playing
makes
one
feel
quite
uncomfortable
and
worried
probably
that
is
what
you
call
devilish
modern
dominie
yes
emma
but
do
people
like
it
dominie
certainly
a
great
many
people
do
it
has
the
superior
air
of
genius
and
sounds
very
original
gold
has
the
creation
in
her
hand
and
silver
leads
her
to
the
piano
for
the
execution
of
the
grand
duet
between
adam
and
eve
mr
forte
is
exhausted
and
dominie
plays
the
accompaniment
silver
sings
intelligently
and
unaffectedly
gold
as
before
but
with
still
less
regard
to
time
and
more
out
of
tune
but
she
tries
to
compensate
for
this
by
introducing
very
long
ornaments
at
the
in
the
sung
with
her
thin
piercing
voice
and
she
frequently
rolls
up
her
black
eyes
at
the
conclusion
gold
was
led
to
the
in
great
exhaustion
of
pious
the
divine
art
of
music
celebrates
its
perfect
triumph
in
such
interpretations
of
haydn
gold
were
those
delicious
of
your
own
invention
gold
no
the
charming
first
introduced
them
as
rosina
in
the
barber
of
seville
and
i
had
them
written
down
by
a
musician
in
the
theatre
but
the
employment
of
them
in
this
duet
is
my
own
idea
i
have
already
surprised
and
delighted
a
great
many
people
with
them
in
parties
the
grand
rushing
chromatic
scale
with
which
the
artistic
garcia
astonishes
every
one
when
acting
the
dreaming
fainting
amina
in
la
somnambula
i
introduce
in
the
grand
aria
of
the
divine
prophet
rather
timidly
it
is
true
for
the
boldness
of
a
garcia
can
only
be
acquired
on
the
stage
emma
but
father
jenny
lind
sang
in
this
duet
in
vienna
quite
simply
and
with
a
pure
religious
spirit
dominie
that
is
the
reason
gold
says
that
jenny
lind
sings
too
coldly
and
ought
to
listen
to
more
passionate
models
but
we
will
talk
more
about
this
at
home
gold
now
dominie
will
not
your
daughter
emma
play
us
some
little
trifle
afterwards
i
will
execute
with
silver
by
thy
loving
kindness
o
lord
and
a
few
duets
by
kücken
and
finish
if
the
company
wishes
with
the
grâce
aria
dominie
will
you
allow
me
first
to
replace
this
broken
string
dominie
has
finished
mr
forte
strides
up
to
the
piano
and
plays
his
etude
for
the
left
hand
with
the
right
hand
extended
towards
the
dominie
mr
forte
after
the
conclusion
of
the
would
it
not
have
been
easier
and
more
to
the
purpose
if
you
had
used
both
hands
mr
forte
we
must
forgive
old
people
such
pedantic
observations
you
entirely
mistake
my
do
you
not
see
that
i
am
standing
with
one
foot
in
the
future
are
you
not
aware
that
the
public
wish
not
only
to
listen
but
to
see
something
strange
do
you
not
perceive
also
that
my
appearance
of
produces
a
great
musical
effect
pious
do
you
not
feel
the
special
charm
and
the
fine
effect
which
is
produced
by
the
left
hand
playing
alone
and
no
less
by
the
right
hand
extended
dominie
is
it
so
well
probably
feeling
has
taken
a
false
direction
with
me
i
shall
be
obliged
to
accustom
myself
to
such
parisian
flights
of
sentiment
played
chopin
ballad
in
a
flat
major
after
dominie
had
previously
announced
it
the
company
were
mr
forte
the
bravo
a
very
good
beginning
dominie
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
obliged
to
take
leave
now
i
am
obliged
to
go
to
two
more
soirées
this
evening
and
have
many
letters
of
introduction
to
deliver
silver
miss
emma
i
have
just
heard
that
you
play
finely
a
great
deal
of
chopin
music
let
us
hear
his
two
latest
nocturnes
gold
have
you
heard
the
famous
camilla
pleyel
play
kalkbrenner
charming
d
minor
concerto
do
you
not
also
play
such
brilliant
music
for
example
döhler
beautiful
pathetic
notturno
in
d
flat
lately
played
that
to
us
enchantingly
emma
i
know
it
i
am
teaching
it
to
my
little
sister
cecilia
dominie
will
you
allow
her
now
to
play
chopin
two
nocturnes
opus
i
will
say
nothing
about
the
conclusion
of
the
singing
the
grâce
aria
at
midnight
there
was
a
grand
supper
washed
down
with
sweet
wine
and
seasoned
with
bitter
recollections
of
this
musical
evening
chapter
xv
conclusion
i
have
received
the
following
communication
from
an
old
literary
friend
to
whom
i
sent
my
eighth
chapter
requesting
his
opinion
of
it
motto
are
unreceptive
times
but
that
which
is
eternal
outlives
all
joh
von
müller
my
dear
friend
i
have
read
your
eighth
chapter
what
you
facetiously
call
the
three
trifles
seem
to
me
to
be
three
most
important
points
even
if
you
had
described
them
simply
as
taste
feeling
and
ear
who
expects
superlative
excellence
from
the
age
in
which
he
lives
and
who
dares
to
attack
it
in
its
most
vulnerable
parts
you
grow
more
harsh
and
disagreeable
and
you
do
not
seem
to
consider
how
many
enemies
you
make
among
those
who
think
that
they
have
long
ago
advanced
beyond
these
three
points
just
now
too
when
there
is
so
much
said
about
the
intellectual
in
music
and
about
the
inner
nature
of
the
future
and
when
such
fine
expressions
are
invented
about
it
you
come
forward
with
your
three
unseasonable
trifles
in
the
superlative
degree
do
you
imagine
that
our
intelligent
age
can
not
discern
your
hidden
satire
you
say
that
our
times
are
in
need
of
your
three
trifles
the
necessary
knowledge
and
experience
tout
as
for
prince
louis
ferdinand
dussek
clementi
himmel
hummel
weber
beethoven
who
has
not
heard
all
about
them
after
them
comes
the
period
of
piano
fury
and
the
compositions
appropriate
for
it
now
the
three
trifles
required
are
taste
feeling
and
a
ear
combined
with
the
necessary
superficiality
and
some
power
of
production
tout
after
that
musicians
bethink
themselves
once
more
of
the
genuine
three
trifles
and
return
to
reason
and
we
are
allowed
to
take
delight
in
chopin
mendelssohn
fr
schubert
robert
schumann
and
a
few
others
of
the
same
sort
and
again
in
beethoven
these
were
succeeded
by
mere
dry
imitators
they
were
not
however
of
much
significance
finally
the
very
latest
progress
introduces
a
still
more
extravagant
piano
fury
the
three
trifles
are
now
taste
feeling
and
ear
for
tone
and
with
these
are
required
the
necessary
audacity
immeasurable
vanity
senseless
exhibitions
of
strength
a
poor
touch
upon
the
piano
and
what
they
call
intellect
the
compositions
are
now
embellished
with
appropriate
pictures
on
the
cover
and
with
attractive
in
addition
there
is
much
talk
about
a
higher
beauty
the
which
have
been
already
surmounted
artistic
flights
and
the
misunderstanding
of
the
inner
consciousness
genius
must
be
free
my
old
conservative
friend
you
are
seen
through
your
influence
and
more
especially
your
ideas
about
singing
belong
only
to
a
past
age
they
date
from
the
last
century
you
will
be
derided
with
your
jenny
lind
and
henrietta
sontag
they
are
lifeless
images
of
singers
to
be
kept
in
a
glass
case
are
you
willing
to
remain
ignorant
of
the
magnificent
modern
style
of
voice
can
you
not
go
forward
with
the
advancing
age
progressive
philosophers
will
rap
you
over
the
knuckles
you
imagine
that
our
times
will
stop
for
a
couple
of
lectures
you
will
yet
have
to
learn
what
intellect
signifies
in
short
i
should
not
like
to
stand
in
your
shoes
you
should
conclude
your
book
with
pater
peccavi
even
in
misfortune
your
sympathizing
friend
