a
drastic

foreword
in
the
belief
that
the
establishment
of
a
system
worthy
of
twentieth
century
requirements
is
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
every
family
in
new
york
i
have
spent
considerable
time
during
the
past
few
months
investigating
markets
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
as
a
result
i
am
more
than
ever
conscious
of
the
need
for
an
enlightened
public
opinion
to
support
the
efforts
of
the
terminal
market
commission
to
secure
this
benefit
for
our
community
i
am
convinced
that
our
will
approve
the
requisite
expenditure
once
they
are
roused
to
a
realization
of
the
inadequacy
of
our
centers
in
the
hope
that
my
investigations
may
aid
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
reform
i
have
prepared
these
observations
comments
and
comparisons
it
is
true
that
the
problem
of
the
high
cost
of
living
is
afflicting
the
old
lands
of
europe
the
newer
countries
like
new
zealand
as
well
as
our
own
wide
territories
of
the
united
states
the
causes
vary
according
to
local
conditions
but
everywhere
it
is
agreed
that
a
potent
force
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
consumers
is
found
in
the
establishment
of
efficient
terminal
markets
under
municipal
control
for
all
progressive
cities
with
wise
administration
stringent
inspection
and
sound
safeguards
these
municipal
markets
benefit
both
producers
and
consumers
they
eliminate
considerable
intermediate
expense
delay
and
confusion
last
but
not
least
they
return
a
profit
to
the
city
treasury
it
is
because
our
new
york
markets
achieve
none
of
these
beneficent
results
that
i
issue
this
plea
for
the
establishment
of
an
adequate
system
i
appeal
to
all
who
have
the
welfare
of
their
city
at
heart
to
add
the
force
of
their
opinion
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
civic
improvement

no

the

has
testified
before

that
on

last

there
was

inconvenience
to
the

producers

the
extra

entailed
by
the
lack
of
modern

methods
the

has
almost
quadrupled
its

in
a
generation
but
the
markets
remain
about
as
they
were
many
other
cities
in
the
united

not
only
testify
to
the
value
of
municipal
markets
as
a
means
for
lowering
prices
to
the
consumer

so
guard
their
interests
as

it
will
be

that
no

comparable
to

fails
to
make
the

to

indeed

else
to
set
up
a

within
a

of
seven
miles
of

guildhall
and
this
privilege
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
a
charter
granted
by
edward

in
but
of
late
years
the
city
corporation
has
waived
its
rights
and
allowed
markets
to
be
established
in
various
districts
wherever
a
real
necessity
has
been

the
development

lowered

but
the
local
covered

the
reasons
given
for
the
falling
off
of
the
retail
trade
are
various
but
the
principal
causes
appear
to
be
the
growth
of
big
stores

local
branches

deliver
the
goods
at

thus
relieving
the

of
the

salesmen
at

as

the

growers
have
confidence
in

methods
in

retail

each
dealer

meat
pays
just

does
not

indicate
that

been
exacting
excessive
profits
it
merely
demonstrates
that
too
many
people
handle
the
produce
between
the
farm
and
the
fireside
the
provision
of
an
adequate
terminal
market
system
for
new
york
would
apply
the
remedy
new
york
stands
alone
for
a
city
of
its
importance
in
having
to
face
an
annual
deficit
on
its
markets
the
results
elsewhere
prove
that
the
deficit
could
be
turned
into
a
profit
by
the
creation
of
a
terminal
market
system
equipped
and
administered
on
twentieth
century
lines
america
is
exporting
less
foodstuffs
than
formerly
the
annual
value
has
fallen
in
eleven
years
the
growth
of
the
manufacturing
population
and
the
relative
decrease
of
the
agricultural
population
together
with
the
gradual
impoverishment
of
much
of
our
farm
land
will
soon
make
conditions
worse
unless
we
organize
our
food
distribution
the
first
step
for
new
york
is
the
establishment
of
a
terminal
market
system
it
is
estimated
that
new
york
population
will
continue
to
grow
at
the
rate
of
fully
a
year
so
this
problem
admits
of
no
further
procrastination
in
natural
resources
america
is
the
richest
country
in
the
world
other
nations
have
to
import
vast
quantities
of
produce
because
of
the
restricted
area
of
their
territory
the
comparative
unfruitfulness
of
their
soil
or
their
adverse
climatic
conditions
we
have
a
wide
land
of
boundless
fertility
never
wholly
in
the
grip
of
winter
cold
yet
we
no
more
escape
the
high
cost
of
living
than
these
less
favored
peoples
overseas
they
have
partially
compensated
for
their
disadvantages
by
organizing
their
markets
while
we
have
neglected
that
important
branch
of
civic
enterprise
everywhere
in
europe
the
provision
of
adequate
terminal
markets
under
municipal
control
is
pointed
to
as
a
powerful
aid
in
keeping
food
prices
down
there
is
a
lesson
in
that
for
new
york
and
other
american
cities
there
is
a
lesson
also
for
growers
in
districts
for
experience
shows
that
with
adequate
markets
supplying
produce
at
lower
rates
there
comes
a
demand
for
more
farm
and
garden
stuff
and
a
greater
variety
of
it
this
directly
aids
in
developing
rural
prosperity
and
enhances
the
value
of
agricultural
land
i
believe
a
marked
improvement
will
be
shown
if
a
bureau
is
maintained
to
inform
farmers
as
to
the
demands
of
the
market
and
the
best
method
of
packing
preparing
and
despatching
their
produce
so
as
to
reach
the
market
in
prime
condition
not
only
will
that
aid
the
market
but
it
will
have
a
powerful
influence
in
arresting
the
drift
from
the
land
to
the
cities
the
municipality
should
select
central
positions
for
its
markets
with
rail
and
river
access
it
should
have
effective
control
not
only
over
the
markets
but
the
adjacent
streets
wharves
and
railroad
sidings
so
as
to
obviate
evasion
of
the
market
tolls
the
rentals
should
not
be
high
and
no
should
be
allowed
under
any
circumstances
under
such
conditions
with
wise
administration
new
york
terminal
market
system
could
be
made
a
model
that
would
be
studied
by
other
cities
in
an
age
when
economic
questions
absorb
the
attention
of
all
our
men
and
women
in
the
interests
of
the
people
health
and
happiness
no
less
than
in
consideration
of
the
municipal
finances
all
should
rally
to
the
support
of
those
who
are
seeking
to
secure
the
consummation
of

urgent
reform
at
