in
the
sacred
memory
of
my
father
and
mother
to
the
reader
this
study
of
edgar
allan
poe
poet
and
man
is
simply
an
attempt
to
make
something
like
a
finished
picture
of
the
shadowy
sketch
the
biographers
hampered
by
the
limitations
of
proved
fact
must
at
best
give
us
to
this
end
i
have
used
the
license
to
present
the
facts
in
picturesque
form
yet
i
believe
i
have
told
a
true
story
true
to
the
spirit
if
not
to
the
letter
for
i
think
i
have
made
poe
and
the
other
persons
of
the
drama
do
nothing
they
may
not
have
done
say
nothing
they
may
not
have
said
feel
nothing
they
may
not
have
felt
in
many
instances
the
opinions
and
even
the
words
i
have
placed
in
poe
mouth
are
his
own
found
in
his
published
works
or
his
letters
i
owe
much
of
course
to
the
writers
of
poe
books
before
and
up
to
my
time
among
these
i
would
make
especial
and
grateful
acknowledgment
to
ingram
professor
george
woodberry
professor
james
harrison
and
susan
archer
weiss
but
more
than
to
any
one
of
his
biographers
i
am
indebted
to
poe
himself
for
the
revelations
of
his
personality
which
appear
in
his
own
stories
and
poems
the
most
part
of
which
are
clearly
autobiographic
the
dreamer
chapter
i
the
last
roses
of
the
year
were
in
bloom
in
the
richmond
gardens
and
their
petals
would
soon
be
scattered
broadcast
by
the
winds
which
had
already
stripped
the
trees
and
left
them
standing
naked
against
the
cold
sky
cold
indeed
it
looked
through
the
small
smoky
window
to
the
eyes
of
the
young
and
beautiful
woman
who
lay
dying
of
hectic
fever
in
a
dark
musty
room
back
of
the
shop
of
fipps
the
milliner
in
lower
main
street
cold
and
friendless
and
drear
she
was
still
beautiful
though
the
sparkle
in
the
great
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bleak
sky
had
given
place
to
deep
melancholy
and
her
face
was
pinched
and
wan
she
knew
that
she
was
dying
meanwhile
her
appearance
as
leading
lady
of
placide
company
of
high
class
players
was
flauntingly
announced
by
newspaper
and
the
advertisement
had
put
society
in
a
flutter
for
elizabeth
arnold
poe
was
a
favorite
with
the
public
not
only
for
her
graces
of
person
and
personality
her
charming
acting
singing
and
dancing
but
she
had
that
incalculable
advantage
for
an
actress
an
appealing
it
was
known
that
she
had
lately
lost
a
dearly
loved
and
loving
husband
whom
she
had
tenderly
nursed
through
a
distressing
illness
it
was
also
known
that
the
husband
had
been
a
descendant
of
a
proud
old
family
and
that
the
same
high
spirit
which
had
led
his
grandfather
general
poe
passionately
denouncing
british
tyranny
to
join
the
revolutionary
army
had
taking
a
different
turn
with
the
grandson
made
him
for
the
sake
of
the
gifted
daughter
of
old
england
who
had
captured
his
heart
actress
though
she
was
sever
home
ties
abandon
the
career
chosen
for
him
by
his
parents
and
devote
himself
to
the
profession
of
which
she
was
a
chief
ornament
a
brief
five
years
of
idylic
happiness
the
pair
had
spent
together
happiness
in
spite
of
much
work
and
some
tears
then
david
poe
had
succumbed
to
consumption
leaving
a
penniless
widow
with
three
children
to
support
the
eldest
a
boy
was
adopted
by
his
father
relatives
in
baltimore
the
other
two
a
boy
of
three
years
in
whom
were
blended
the
spirit
the
beauty
the
talent
and
the
ardent
nature
of
both
parents
and
a
cooing
baby
girl
were
clinging
about
their
mother
whenever
she
was
seen
off
the
stage
making
a
picture
that
was
the
admiration
of
all
beholders
the
last
roses
of
the
year
would
soon
be
gone
from
the
gardens
but
fipps
windows
blossomed
gallantly
with
garlands
and
sprays
more
wonderful
than
any
that
ever
grew
on
tree
or
shrub
not
for
many
a
long
day
had
the
shop
enjoyed
such
a
thriving
trade
for
no
sooner
had
the
news
that
placide
company
would
open
a
season
at
the
theatre
been
noised
abroad
than
the
town
beaux
addressed
themselves
to
the
task
of
penning
elegant
little
notes
inviting
the
town
belles
to
accompany
them
to
the
play
while
the
belles
themselves
scenting
an
opportunity
to
complete
the
wreck
of
masculine
hearts
that
was
their
chief
business
addressed
themselves
as
promptly
to
the
quest
of
the
most
ravishing
theatre
bonnets
which
the
latest
paris
fashions
as
interpreted
by
fipps
could
produce
as
that
lady
bustled
back
and
forth
among
her
customers
her
mouth
full
of
pins
and
hands
full
of
ribbons
feathers
flowers
and
what
not
her
face
wore
in
spite
of
her
prosperity
an
expression
of
unusual
gravity
could
not
get
the
lodger
in
the
back
room
off
her
placide
who
had
been
to
see
the
sick
woman
was
confident
that
her
disorder
was
nothing
serious
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
meet
her
engagements
and
charged
the
thrifty
dealer
in
fashionable
and
furnished
rooms
by
no
means
to
let
the
fact
that
the
star
was
ill
get
out
but
the
that
tinged
the
patient
pale
cheeks
and
the
cough
that
racked
her
wasted
frame
seemed
very
like
danger
signals
to
good
fipps
and
though
she
did
not
realize
the
hopelessness
of
the
case
her
spirits
were
oppressed
by
a
heaviness
that
would
not
be
shaken
off
ill
as
poe
or
miss
arnold
as
she
was
still
sometimes
called
was
she
had
managed
by
a
mighty
effort
of
will
and
the
aid
of
stimulants
to
appear
once
or
twice
before
the
footlights
but
her
acting
had
been
spiritless
and
her
voice
weak
and
it
finally
became
necessary
for
the
manager
to
explain
that
she
was
suffering
from
chills
and
fevers
from
which
he
hoped
rest
and
skillful
treatment
would
relieve
her
and
make
it
possible
for
her
to
take
her
usual
place
but
she
did
not
appear
gradually
her
true
condition
became
generally
known
and
in
the
hearts
of
a
kindly
public
disappointment
gave
place
to
sympathy
some
of
the
most
charitably
disposed
among
the
citizens
visited
her
bringing
comforts
and
delicacies
for
her
and
presents
for
the
pretty
innocent
babes
who
all
unconscious
of
the
cloud
that
hung
over
them
played
happily
upon
the
floor
of
the
dark
and
bare
room
in
which
their
mother
life
was
burning
out
nurse
betty
an
ample
motherly
soul
with
cheeks
like
winter
apples
and
eyes
like
blue
china
and
a
huge
ruffled
cap
hiding
her
straggly
grey
locks
from
view
versatile
betty
who
was
not
only
nurse
for
the
children
and
lady
maid
for
the
star
but
upon
occasion
appeared
in
small
parts
herself
hovered
about
the
bed
and
ministered
to
her
dying
mistress
as
the
hours
and
days
dragged
by
the
patient
grew
steadily
weaker
and
weaker
she
seldom
spoke
but
lay
quite
silent
and
still
save
when
shaken
by
the
torturing
cough
on
a
sunday
morning
early
in
december
she
lay
thus
motionless
but
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
that
broke
the
quiet
air
as
the
voice
of
the
last
bell
died
away
she
stirred
and
requested
in
faint
accents
that
a
packet
from
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
be
brought
to
her
when
this
was
done
she
asked
for
the
children
and
when
nurse
betty
brought
them
to
the
bedside
she
gave
into
the
hands
of
the
wondering
boy
a
miniature
of
herself
upon
the
back
of
which
was
written
for
my
dear
little
son
edgar
from
his
mother
and
a
small
bundle
of
letters
tied
with
blue
ribbon
she
clasped
the
baby
fingers
of
the
girl
about
an
enameled
of
artistic
workmanship
but
empty
for
its
contents
had
alas
gone
to
pay
for
food
she
then
motioned
that
the
little
ones
be
raised
up
and
allowed
to
kiss
her
after
which
a
frail
white
hand
fluttered
to
the
sunny
head
of
each
as
she
murmured
a
few
words
of
blessing
then
with
a
gentle
sigh
closed
her
eyes
in
her
last
long
sleep
the
baby
girl
began
to
whimper
with
fright
at
the
suddenness
with
which
she
was
snatched
up
and
borne
from
the
room
and
the
boy
looked
with
awe
into
the
face
of
the
weeping
nurse
who
holding
his
sister
in
one
arm
dragged
him
away
from
the
bedside
and
out
of
the
door
by
the
hand
there
was
much
hurried
tramping
to
and
fro
opening
and
closing
of
doors
and
drawing
to
of
these
unusual
sounds
filled
the
boy
with
a
vague
fear
that
night
the
children
were
put
to
bed
upon
a
pallet
in
fipps
own
room
and
fipps
herself
rocked
the
baby
rosalie
to
sleep
and
gave
the
little
edgar
in
addition
to
his
bread
and
milk
and
told
him
stories
of
heaven
and
beautiful
angels
playing
upon
golden
harps
the
next
day
the
children
were
taken
back
to
their
mother
room
the
shutter
to
the
window
which
let
in
the
one
patch
of
dim
light
was
now
closed
and
the
room
was
quite
dark
save
for
two
candles
that
stood
upon
stands
one
at
the
foot
the
other
at
the
head
of
the
bed
the
air
was
heavy
sickening
almost
with
the
odor
of
flowers
upon
the
bed
all
dressed
in
white
and
with
a
wreath
of
white
roses
on
her
dark
ringlets
lay
their
mother
with
eyelids
fast
shut
and
a
lovely
smile
on
her
lips
she
was
very
white
and
very
beautiful
but
when
her
little
boy
kissed
her
the
pale
lips
were
cold
on
his
rosy
ones
as
if
the
smile
had
frozen
there
it
was
very
beautiful
but
the
boy
was
a
little
frightened
mother
he
said
softly
pleadingly
wake
up
i
want
you
to
wake
up
the
weeping
nurse
placed
her
arm
around
him
and
knelt
beside
the
bed
she
will
never
wake
up
again
here
on
earth
eddie
darling
never
nevermore
she
has
gone
to
live
with
the
angels
where
you
will
be
with
her
some
day
but
never
nevermore
on
earth
with
that
she
fell
to
weeping
bitterly
hiding
her
face
on
his
little
shoulder
the
child
marvelling
softly
repeated
nevermore
nevermore
the
solemn
musical
word
with
the
picture
in
the
dim
light
of
the
sleeping
figure
asleep
to
wake
nevermore
and
so
white
so
white
all
save
the
dusky
curls
sank
deep
into
his
young
mind
and
memory
his
great
grey
eyes
were
wistful
with
the
beauty
and
the
sadness
and
the
mystery
of
it
all
the
next
day
the
boy
rode
in
a
carriage
with
fipps
and
nurse
betty
who
had
left
off
the
big
white
cap
and
was
enveloped
from
head
to
foot
in
black
up
a
long
hill
to
a
white
church
in
a
churchyard
where
the
grass
was
still
green
between
the
tombstones
the
bell
in
the
white
steeple
was
tolling
slowly
solemnly
soft
grey
clouds
hung
over
the
steeple
and
as
big
as
began
to
fill
the
air
presently
the
bell
ceased
tolling
and
he
and
nurse
betty
moved
up
the
aisle
behind
a
train
of
figures
in
black
with
black
streamers
floating
from
their
sleeves
the
figures
bent
beneath
a
heavy
burden
it
was
long
and
black
and
grim
but
the
flowers
that
covered
it
were
and
filled
the
church
with
a
sweet
smell
a
figure
led
the
way
up
the
aisle
repeating
as
he
walked
some
words
so
solemn
and
full
of
melody
that
they
sounded
almost
like
music
the
church
was
dim
and
quiet
and
nearly
empty
the
organ
began
to
play
oh
so
softly
it
was
very
beautiful
but
still
the
boy
shuddered
for
he
dimly
realized
that
the
grim
box
held
the
sleeping
form
that
seemed
to
be
his
mother
but
was
not
his
real
mother
kisses
were
not
frozen
and
was
in
heaven
with
the
angels
the
choir
sang
sweet
music
and
the
priest
said
more
solemn
words
that
were
like
spoken
music
then
the
procession
moved
slowly
down
the
aisle
again
and
out
of
the
door
the
bell
in
the
steeple
was
silent
now
and
the
organ
was
silent
silently
the
procession
moved
silently
the
snow
came
down
silently
and
softly
like
white
flowers
the
green
graves
were
white
with
it
now
like
the
flowers
on
the
coffin
lid
but
the
open
grave
in
the
churchyard
corner
near
the
wall
it
was
dark
and
deep
and
terrible
the
boy
heart
almost
stood
still
as
clinging
to
nurse
betty
hand
he
stared
into
its
yawning
mouth
he
felt
that
he
would
choke
would
suffocate
they
were
lowering
the
box
into
that
deep
dark
pit
what
if
the
sleeping
figure
should
awake
after
all
awake
to
the
darkness
and
narrowness
of
that
narrow
bed
with
a
piercing
shriek
the
child
broke
from
his
nurse
hand
and
thrust
himself
upon
the
arm
of
one
of
the
black
figures
who
held
the
ropes
in
a
wild
effort
to
stay
him
then
still
shrieking
was
borne
from
the
spot
chapter
ii
since
it
seems
you
have
set
your
heart
upon
this
thing
i
do
not
forbid
it
but
remember
you
are
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
my
judgment
and
advice
and
if
you
ever
live
to
regret
it
as
i
believe
you
shall
you
will
have
no
one
but
yourself
to
blame
john
allan
voice
was
harsher
more
positive
than
usual
his
shoulders
seemed
to
square
themselves
and
a
frowning
brow
hardened
an
always
austere
face
his
whole
manner
was
that
of
a
man
consenting
against
his
will
his
young
wife
hung
over
his
chair
vainly
endeavoring
to
smooth
with
little
pats
of
her
fair
hands
the
stubborn
locks
that
stand
on
end
like
the
bristles
of
a
brush
whatever
she
did
her
soft
and
vivacious
beauty
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
strength
and
severity
of
his
rugged
and
at
the
same
time
distinguished
countenance
his
narrow
eyes
deep
sunk
under
bushy
brows
and
a
high
but
narrow
forehead
were
shrewd
and
piercing
his
nose
was
large
and
like
a
hawk
beak
his
face
too
was
narrow
with
high
as
an
indian
his
mouth
was
large
but
firmly
closed
and
the
chin
below
it
was
long
and
prominent
and
was
carried
stiffly
above
the
high
stock
and
immaculate
starched
her
figure
as
she
leaned
against
the
chair
high
back
was
slender
and
girlish
childish
almost
in
its
empire
dress
of
some
filmy
stuff
the
pale
yellow
of
a
marshal
niel
rose
her
face
was
a
pure
oval
with
delicate
regular
features
her
hair
parted
in
the
middle
was
piled
on
top
of
her
small
head
and
airy
little
curls
hung
down
on
her
brow
on
either
side
of
the
part
her
eyes
the
color
of
her
hair
were
gentle
and
sweet
and
her
mouth
was
tenderly
curved
and
rosy
with
her
imploring
attitude
the
sweetness
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
and
the
warmth
of
her
plea
her
fresh
beauty
glowed
like
a
flower
newly
opened
all
unmoved
john
allan
repeated
you
will
have
no
one
but
yourself
to
blame
her
ardor
undimmed
by
the
chariness
of
the
consent
she
had
gained
she
showered
the
lowering
brow
with
cool
delicate
little
kisses
until
it
grew
smooth
in
spite
of
itself
oh
i
know
i
never
shall
regret
it
john
she
cooed
he
is
such
a
beautiful
boy
so
sweet
and
affectionate
so
merry
and
clever
just
what
i
should
like
our
own
little
boy
to
be
john
if
god
had
blessed
us
with
one
i
grant
you
he
seems
a
bonny
little
lad
enough
frances
but
i
realize
as
it
seems
you
do
not
the
risk
of
undertaking
to
rear
as
your
own
the
child
of
any
but
the
most
unquestionable
parentage
i
confess
the
thought
of
introducing
into
my
family
the
son
of
professional
players
is
extremely
distasteful
to
me
but
john
dear
you
know
these
poes
were
not
ordinary
players
the
father
was
one
of
the
maryland
poes
and
i
understand
the
mother
came
of
good
english
stock
she
certainly
seemed
to
be
a
lady
and
a
good
sweet
woman
poor
thing
the
mackenzies
have
decided
to
adopt
the
baby
rosalie
though
they
have
children
as
you
know
and
with
this
charming
little
edgar
for
my
very
own
i
shall
be
the
happiest
woman
alive
well
well
keep
your
pretty
little
pet
but
if
he
turns
out
to
be
other
than
a
credit
to
you
do
forget
that
you
were
warned
and
so
the
little
edgar
poe
the
players
child
became
edgar
allan
with
a
fond
and
admiring
young
mother
who
became
at
once
and
forever
his
slave
and
whose
chief
object
in
life
henceforth
was
to
stand
between
him
and
the
discipline
of
a
not
intentionally
harsh
or
unkind
but
strict
and
uncompromising
father
who
though
he
too
was
fond
of
the
boy
in
a
way
and
proud
of
his
beauty
and
little
accomplishments
was
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
the
cloven
foot
which
his
fixed
prejudice
against
the
child
parentage
made
him
certain
would
appear
in
her
delight
over
her
acquisition
frances
allan
was
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
she
almost
smothered
him
with
kisses
when
accepting
her
bribe
of
a
spaniel
pup
and
his
pockets
full
of
he
agreed
to
call
her
mother
with
her
own
fingers
she
made
him
the
quaintest
little
baggy
trousers
of
silk
pongee
and
a
velvet
jacket
and
a
tucker
of
the
finest
linen
his
cheap
cotton
stockings
were
discarded
for
scarlet
silk
ones
and
for
his
head
sunny
over
with
curls
of
bright
she
bought
from
fipps
the
prettiest
peaked
cap
of
purple
velvet
with
a
handsome
gold
tassel
that
fell
gracefully
over
on
one
shoulder
thus
arrayed
she
took
him
about
town
with
her
to
show
him
to
her
friends
who
were
ecstatic
in
their
admiration
of
his
pensive
features
his
big
grey
eyes
and
his
ringlets
of
his
charming
smile
and
the
frank
pretty
manner
in
which
he
gave
his
small
hand
in
greeting
oh
but
you
should
hear
him
recite
and
sing
the
proud
would
say
and
he
can
dance
too
she
gave
a
large
just
to
exhibit
the
accomplishments
of
her
treasure
actually
standing
him
upon
the
table
when
it
had
been
cleared
to
sing
and
recite
for
the
guests
even
her
husband
unbent
so
far
as
to
applaud
vigorously
the
modest
yet
grace
with
which
the
mite
drank
the
healths
of
the
assembled
company
making
a
neat
little
speech
that
his
new
mother
had
taught
him
the
boy
young
heart
responded
to
the
affection
of
the
to
a
certain
degree
but
mere
baby
though
he
was
his
real
heart
lay
deep
in
the
grave
on
the
where
the
earthly
part
of
that
other
mother
was
lying
so
still
so
white
with
the
roses
on
her
hair
and
the
frozen
smile
on
her
lips
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
was
but
a
short
distance
away
from
his
new
home
and
as
spring
opened
became
a
favorite
resort
of
nurses
and
children
the
negro
mammy
who
had
replaced
nurse
betty
used
often
to
take
him
there
and
often
as
she
chatted
with
other
mammies
her
charge
would
wander
from
her
side
to
the
grave
against
the
wall
where
he
would
stretch
his
small
body
full
length
upon
the
turf
and
whisper
the
thoughts
of
his
infant
mind
to
the
dear
one
below
for
who
knew
but
that
even
down
under
ground
she
might
be
glad
to
hear
through
her
white
sleep
her
little
boy
words
of
love
and
remembrance
though
never
nevermore
she
could
see
him
on
earth
he
would
even
imagine
her
replies
to
him
until
the
conversations
with
her
became
so
real
that
he
half
believed
they
were
true
at
night
when
came
he
said
his
prayers
at
the
knee
of
his
pretty
new
mother
who
told
him
jolly
stories
and
sang
him
jolly
songs
and
patted
him
and
soothed
him
with
caresses
which
he
found
very
agreeable
and
accepted
graciously
but
he
always
took
the
miniature
which
had
been
his
dying
mother
parting
gift
to
bed
with
him
and
he
was
glad
when
the
new
mother
kissed
him
goodnight
and
put
out
the
light
and
softly
closed
the
door
behind
her
for
it
was
then
with
the
picture
close
against
his
breast
that
the
visions
came
to
him
the
visions
of
angels
making
sweet
music
upon
golden
harps
and
among
them
his
lost
mother
with
her
sweet
face
saddened
but
made
sweeter
still
by
that
thought
of
nevermore
oh
that
wondrous
word
nevermore
its
music
charmed
him
its
hopelessness
filled
and
thrilled
him
with
a
strange
a
holy
sorrow
in
which
there
was
no
pain
with
the
lovely
vision
still
about
him
the
picture
still
clasped
to
his
breast
he
would
sink
into
healthful
sleep
to
wake
on
the
morrow
a
bright
joyous
boy
alive
to
all
the
pleasures
of
the
new
day
delighting
in
the
beauties
of
blue
sky
and
sunshine
of
whispering
tree
and
opening
flower
ready
for
sport
with
his
and
his
pets
and
full
of
all
manner
of
merry
pranks
and
jokes
for
in
the
frame
of
this
small
boy
there
dwelt
two
distinct
personalities
twin
brothers
yet
as
utterly
unlike
as
strangers
and
foreigners
thinking
different
thoughts
speaking
different
languages
and
dominating
him
spirit
and
body
by
turns
one
of
these
we
will
call
edgar
goodfellow
edgar
the
gay
the
the
daring
the
real
live
wholesome
normal
boy
keen
for
the
society
of
other
boys
and
liking
to
dance
to
run
to
jump
to
climb
even
to
fight
the
other
edgar
the
dreamer
fond
of
solitude
and
silence
and
darkness
for
they
aided
him
to
wander
far
away
from
the
everyday
world
to
one
of
make
believe
created
by
himself
and
filled
with
beings
to
whom
real
people
were
but
as
empty
shadows
but
a
world
that
the
death
and
burial
of
his
beautiful
and
adored
young
mother
and
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
those
scenes
had
tinged
with
an
eternal
sadness
which
hung
over
it
as
a
veil
the
life
of
edgar
the
dreamer
was
filled
with
the
subtle
charm
of
mystery
it
was
a
secret
life
the
world
in
which
he
moved
was
a
secret
world
an
invisible
world
to
whose
invisible
door
he
alone
held
the
key
edgar
the
dreamer
was
himself
an
invisible
person
for
the
only
outward
difference
between
him
and
his
twin
brother
edgar
goodfellow
lay
in
a
certain
quiet
listless
air
and
the
solemn
look
in
his
big
dark
grey
eyes
which
his
playmates
bored
and
intolerant
took
as
indications
that
edgar
was
in
one
of
his
moods
and
his
eyeing
him
keenly
and
with
marked
displeasure
as
an
equally
unmistakable
indication
that
he
was
hatching
mischief
there
were
times
when
in
the
midst
of
the
liveliest
company
this
mood
would
possess
the
child
he
would
fall
silent
his
mouth
would
become
pensive
his
dark
grey
eyes
would
seem
to
be
impenetrably
veiled
his
chin
would
drop
upon
his
hand
he
would
seem
utterly
forgetful
of
his
surroundings
the
familiar
edgar
edgar
goodfellow
would
have
given
place
to
edgar
the
dreamer
who
though
apparently
of
the
company
would
really
have
slipped
through
that
invisible
portal
and
wandered
far
afield
with
the
playmates
of
his
fancy
at
such
times
allan
would
say
eddie
what
are
you
thinking
about
and
brought
back
to
her
world
with
a
jolt
the
boy
would
answer
quickly
somewhat
guiltily
it
seemed
to
allan
noting
the
startled
expression
nothing
it
was
his
first
lie
and
a
very
little
one
but
one
that
was
often
repeated
for
he
that
would
guard
a
secret
must
be
used
to
practice
deception
allan
would
say
wake
up
wake
up
child
only
the
idle
sit
and
stare
at
nothing
and
think
of
nothing
you
be
growing
up
an
idle
trifling
boy
if
you
give
way
to
such
a
habit
between
the
allans
and
edgar
the
dreamer
a
great
gulf
lay
for
how
should
a
dreamer
of
reveal
himself
to
any
not
of
his
own
tribe
and
kind
upon
edgar
goodfellow
allan
doted
all
of
her
friends
agreed
with
her
that
so
remarkable
a
child
one
so
precocious
and
still
so
attractive
had
never
been
seen
and
allan
was
secretly
as
proud
of
his
wrestling
running
riding
and
other
triumphs
as
his
wife
was
of
his
pretty
parlor
accomplishments
their
friends
agreed
too
that
she
made
him
the
best
of
mothers
barring
the
fact
for
which
weakness
she
was
excusable
he
was
such
a
love
that
she
spoiled
him
and
perhaps
permitted
him
to
rule
her
too
absolutely
was
he
grateful
oh
well
that
would
come
in
time
appreciation
was
not
a
quality
to
be
expected
in
children
and
what
more
natural
than
that
the
boy
should
accept
as
a
matter
of
course
the
good
things
which
she
made
plain
it
was
her
chief
pleasure
in
life
to
shower
upon
him
she
was
indeed
as
good
a
mother
as
it
was
possible
for
a
mother
without
a
highly
developed
imagination
to
be
a
most
lovely
woman
was
frances
allan
justly
admired
and
liked
by
all
who
knew
her
she
was
pretty
and
gracious
and
and
charitable
both
to
society
and
the
poor
and
faithful
to
her
religious
duties
withal
a
notable
given
to
hospitality
fond
of
company
and
gifted
in
the
art
of
making
her
friends
feel
at
home
under
her
roof
if
she
was
not
gifted
with
a
lively
imagination
she
did
not
know
it
and
so
had
not
missed
it
as
allan
wife
she
had
not
needed
it
and
so
she
lavished
upon
edgar
goodfellow
everything
that
heart
could
wish
she
delighted
to
provide
him
with
pets
and
toys
and
good
things
to
eat
and
to
fill
his
little
pockets
with
money
for
him
to
spend
upon
himself
or
upon
treating
his
friends
fortunately
the
other
edgar
edgar
the
dreamer
was
not
dependent
upon
her
for
his
pleasures
for
the
beauties
of
sky
and
river
and
garden
and
wood
which
nourished
his
soul
were
within
his
own
reach
if
allan
had
known
edgar
the
dreamer
she
would
have
been
puzzled
and
alarmed
if
allan
had
known
him
he
would
have
been
angry
a
man
of
action
was
john
allan
a
canny
scotchman
he
who
owed
his
success
as
a
tobacco
merchant
to
energy
and
strict
attention
to
business
if
there
were
dreams
in
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
of
a
thrifty
dealer
in
the
weed
meditation
had
no
part
in
his
life
was
left
out
of
his
composition
he
believed
in
was
in
his
opinion
but
another
name
for
idling
and
idling
was
sin
the
son
of
their
adoption
vaguely
realized
the
lack
of
kinship
the
impossibility
of
contact
between
his
nature
and
theirs
and
as
time
went
on
drew
more
and
more
within
himself
the
life
of
edgar
the
dreamer
became
more
and
more
secret
so
often
however
did
the
warning
against
his
idle
habit
fall
upon
his
ears
that
the
plastic
conscience
of
childhood
made
note
of
it
confusing
the
will
of
a
blind
human
guardian
with
that
of
god
the
eden
of
his
dreams
guarded
by
the
flaming
sword
of
his
wrath
began
to
assume
the
aspect
because
by
parental
command
denied
him
of
an
evil
place
though
none
the
less
sweet
to
his
soul
and
it
was
with
a
consciousness
of
guilt
that
he
would
steal
in
and
wander
there
thus
the
habit
that
nurtured
genius
branded
as
sin
and
forbidden
might
have
been
broken
up
altogether
or
in
part
had
not
the
special
providence
that
looks
after
the
development
of
this
rare
exotic
transplanted
it
to
a
more
fertile
soil
a
more
congenial
clime
chapter
iii
upon
a
mellow
september
afternoon
three
years
after
the
newspapers
had
announced
the
death
in
richmond
virginia
of
elizabeth
arnold
the
popular
english
actress
generally
known
in
the
united
states
as
poe
the
ancient
town
of
in
the
suburbs
of
london
dozing
in
the
shadows
of
its
immemorial
elms
was
aroused
to
a
mild
degree
of
activity
by
the
appearance
upon
its
streets
of
three
strangers
evidently
americans
it
was
not
so
much
their
nationality
as
a
certain
distinguished
air
that
drew
attention
upon
the
dignified
and
proper
gentleman
in
broadcloth
and
immaculate
linen
the
pretty
and
fashionably
dressed
lady
and
especially
the
little
boy
of
six
or
seven
summers
with
the
large
wistful
eyes
and
pale
complexion
and
chestnut
ringlets
framing
a
prominent
white
brow
and
tumbling
over
a
broad
snowy
tucker
he
wore
pongee
knickerbockers
and
red
silk
stockings
and
on
his
curls
jauntily
rested
a
peaked
velvet
cap
from
which
a
heavy
gold
tassel
fell
over
upon
his
shoulder
the
denizens
of
old
gazed
upon
this
prosperous
trio
with
frank
curiosity
the
reader
has
already
recognized
john
allan
and
his
wife
frances
and
little
edgar
poe
their
adopted
child
the
sun
was
still
hot
and
the
refreshing
chill
in
the
dusky
street
under
its
arch
of
interlacing
boughs
was
grateful
to
the
tired
little
traveller
as
he
moved
along
clinging
to
allan
hand
his
big
eyes
gazing
as
far
as
they
might
up
the
long
cool
aisle
the
trees
made
the
hazy
green
distance
invited
his
fancy
the
odors
of
a
thousand
flowering
shrubberies
were
on
the
air
and
he
felt
that
it
was
good
to
be
in
this
dreaming
old
town
as
old
it
seemed
to
him
as
the
world
and
there
was
born
in
him
at
that
moment
though
he
could
not
have
defined
it
a
sense
of
the
picturesquesness
the
charm
the
fragrance
of
old
things
old
streets
old
houses
old
trees
old
turf
and
shrubberies
even
with
their
haunting
suggestions
of
bygone
days
and
scenes
they
passed
the
ancient
gothic
church
standing
solemn
and
serene
among
its
mossy
tombs
in
the
misty
blue
atmosphere
above
the
elms
the
fretted
steeple
seemed
to
the
boy
to
lie
imbedded
and
asleep
but
even
as
he
gazed
upon
it
the
churchbell
sounding
the
hour
broke
the
stillness
with
a
deep
hollow
roar
which
thrilled
him
with
mingled
awe
and
delight
ah
here
indeed
was
a
place
made
for
dreaming
in
the
midst
of
the
town
lay
the
manor
house
school
where
the
scholarly
bransby
who
preached
in
the
gothic
church
on
sundays
upon
instructed
boys
in
various
branches
of
polite
learning
and
also
frequently
flogged
them
this
school
was
the
destination
of
the
three
strangers
from
america
for
here
the
foundations
of
young
education
were
to
be
laid
during
the
several
years
residence
of
his
in
london
in
which
city
the
boy
himself
would
pass
his
holidays
and
sometimes
be
permitted
to
spend
the
ample
grounds
of
the
school
were
enclosed
from
the
rest
of
the
town
by
a
high
and
thick
brick
wall
dingy
with
years
which
seemed
to
frown
like
a
prison
wall
upon
the
grassy
and
pleasantly
shaded
freedom
without
at
one
corner
of
this
ponderous
wall
was
set
a
more
ponderous
gate
riveted
and
studded
with
iron
bolts
and
surmounted
with
jagged
iron
spikes
as
the
boy
passed
through
it
he
trembled
with
delicious
awe
which
was
deepened
by
the
ominous
creak
of
the
mighty
hinges
he
fancied
himself
entering
upon
a
domain
of
mystery
and
adventure
where
all
manner
of
grim
and
unearthly
monsters
might
cross
his
pathway
to
be
wrestled
with
and
destroyed
the
path
to
the
house
lay
through
a
small
parterre
planted
with
box
and
other
shrubs
and
beyond
stretched
the
playgrounds
as
for
the
house
itself
that
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
the
boy
as
a
veritable
palace
of
enchantment
it
was
a
large
grey
rambling
structure
of
the
elizabethan
age
within
it
was
like
a
labyrinth
edgar
wondered
if
there
were
any
end
to
its
windings
and
incomprehensible
divisions
and
to
its
narrow
dusky
passages
and
its
steps
down
and
up
up
and
down
to
its
odd
and
unexpected
nooks
and
corners
scarce
two
rooms
seemed
to
him
to
be
upon
the
same
level
and
between
continually
going
down
or
up
three
or
four
steps
in
a
journey
through
the
mansion
upon
which
bransby
guided
him
and
his
the
dazed
little
boy
found
it
almost
impossible
to
determine
upon
which
of
the
two
main
floors
he
happened
to
be
it
was
afterward
to
become
a
source
of
secret
satisfaction
to
him
that
he
never
finally
decided
upon
which
floor
was
the
dim
sleeping
apartment
to
which
he
was
introduced
soon
after
supper
and
which
he
shared
with
eighteen
or
twenty
other
boys
the
business
of
formally
entering
the
pupil
about
whom
the
allans
and
bransby
had
already
corresponded
in
the
school
was
soon
dispatched
and
once
more
the
iron
gate
swung
open
upon
its
weirdly
complaining
hinges
then
went
to
again
with
a
bang
and
a
clang
and
the
little
boy
from
far
virginia
with
the
wistful
grey
eyes
and
the
sunny
curls
was
alone
in
a
throng
of
curious
and
in
the
dimness
the
strangeness
the
vastness
of
a
hoary
mysterious
mansion
full
of
echoes
and
of
quaint
crannies
and
closets
where
shadows
lurked
by
day
as
well
as
by
alone
yet
not
unhappy
for
edgar
the
dreamer
was
holding
full
sway
with
the
departure
of
his
all
check
was
removed
from
his
fancy
which
could
and
did
run
riot
in
this
creepy
and
fascinating
old
place
and
at
night
he
had
to
comfort
him
the
miniature
of
his
mother
from
which
he
had
never
been
parted
for
an
hour
and
which
he
still
carried
to
bed
with
him
with
unfailing
regularity
he
had
always
known
that
his
mother
was
and
somehow
in
his
mind
there
seemed
to
be
some
mystic
connection
between
this
ancient
town
and
manor
house
and
the
green
graveyard
in
richmond
with
its
mouldy
tombstones
and
encompassing
wall
not
until
the
next
morning
was
the
new
pupil
ushered
into
the
the
largest
room
in
the
world
it
seemed
to
the
small
lonely
stranger
it
was
long
narrow
and
its
ceiling
was
of
oak
black
with
age
and
the
daylight
struggled
fitfully
in
through
pointed
gothic
windows
built
into
a
remote
and
corner
was
a
enclosure
eight
or
ten
feet
high
of
heavy
oak
like
the
ceiling
with
a
massy
door
of
the
same
sombre
wood
this
the
newcomer
soon
learned
was
the
sanctum
of
the
the
rev
bransby
whose
sour
visage
snuffy
habiliments
and
upraised
ferule
seemed
so
terrible
to
young
edgar
that
on
the
following
sunday
when
he
went
to
service
in
the
gothic
church
it
was
with
a
spirit
of
deep
wonder
and
perplexity
that
he
regarded
from
the
school
gallery
the
reverend
man
with
countenance
so
demurely
benign
with
robes
so
glossy
and
so
clerically
flowing
with
wig
so
minutely
powdered
so
rigid
and
so
vast
who
with
solemn
step
and
slow
ascended
the
high
pulpit
interspersed
about
the
crossing
and
recrossing
in
endless
irregularity
were
benches
and
desks
black
ancient
and
piled
desperately
with
much
bethumbed
books
and
so
beseamed
with
initial
letters
names
at
full
length
grotesque
figures
and
other
multiplied
efforts
of
the
knife
as
to
have
lost
what
little
of
original
form
might
have
been
their
portion
in
days
long
departed
a
huge
bucket
with
water
stood
at
one
extremity
of
the
room
and
a
clock
whose
dimensions
appeared
to
the
boy
to
be
stupendous
at
the
other
but
it
was
not
only
edgar
the
dreamer
who
came
to
manor
house
school
who
passed
out
of
the
great
iron
gate
and
through
the
elm
avenues
to
the
gothic
church
on
sundays
and
who
regularly
on
two
afternoons
in
the
week
made
a
decorous
escape
from
the
confinement
of
the
frowning
walls
and
in
company
with
the
whole
school
in
orderly
procession
and
duly
escorted
by
an
usher
tramped
past
the
church
and
into
the
pleasant
green
fields
that
lay
beyond
the
quaint
houses
of
the
village
edgar
goodfellow
was
there
too
edgar
the
gay
the
frolicsome
the
lover
of
sports
and
hoaxes
and
trials
of
strength
upon
the
evening
of
the
young
american
arrival
his
schoolmates
kept
their
distance
regarding
him
with
shy
curiosity
but
by
the
recess
hour
next
day
this
timidity
had
worn
off
and
they
crowded
about
him
with
the
pointed
questions
and
criticisms
which
constitute
the
breaking
in
of
a
new
scholar
the
boy
received
their
sallies
with
such
politeness
and
good
humor
and
with
such
an
air
of
modest
dignity
that
the
wags
soon
ceased
their
gibes
for
very
shame
and
the
began
to
show
in
their
manner
and
speech
an
air
of
approval
in
place
of
the
suspicion
with
which
they
had
at
first
regarded
him
when
the
questions
what
your
name
how
old
are
you
where
do
you
live
were
you
sick
at
sea
what
made
you
come
to
this
school
how
high
can
you
jump
can
you
box
can
you
fight
and
the
like
had
been
promptly
and
amiably
answered
there
was
a
lull
the
silence
was
broken
by
young
edgar
himself
drawing
himself
up
to
the
full
height
of
his
graceful
little
figure
and
thumping
his
chest
with
his
closed
fist
he
said
any
boy
who
wants
to
may
hit
me
here
as
hard
as
he
can
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
inquiringly
for
a
moment
they
were
uncertain
whether
this
was
a
specimen
of
american
humor
or
to
be
taken
literally
presently
the
largest
and
strongest
among
them
stepped
forward
he
was
a
stalwart
fellow
for
his
years
but
his
excessively
blond
coloring
together
with
the
effeminate
style
in
which
his
mother
insisted
upon
dressing
him
caused
the
boys
to
give
him
the
name
of
beauty
which
was
soon
shortened
into
beaut
and
had
finally
become
the
beau
will
you
let
hit
you
he
asked
yes
replied
edgar
count
three
and
hit
you
ca
hurt
me
as
the
beau
counted
one
two
three
edgar
gently
inflated
his
lungs
expanding
his
chest
to
its
fullest
extent
and
then
at
the
moment
of
receiving
the
blow
exhaled
the
air
he
did
not
stagger
or
flinch
though
his
antagonist
struck
straight
from
the
shoulder
with
a
brawny
small
fist
the
rest
of
the
boys
in
turn
struck
him
each
time
counting
three
with
the
same
result
finally
the
beau
said
hit
edgar
counted
one
two
three
and
struck
out
with
clenched
fist
but
the
beau
not
knowing
the
trick
was
promptly
bowled
over
on
the
grass
the
shock
making
quick
tears
start
in
his
blue
eyes
the
boys
were
one
and
all
open
and
clamorous
in
their
admiration
pshaw
said
young
edgar
indifferently
it
nothing
all
the
boys
in
virginia
can
do
that
can
you
play
asked
freckles
a
wiry
looking
little
fellow
with
carotty
locks
and
a
freckled
nose
whose
leaping
had
hitherto
been
unrivalled
i
show
you
was
the
reply
instantly
a
dozen
backs
were
bent
in
readiness
for
the
game
and
over
them
one
by
one
vaulted
edgar
with
the
lightness
of
a
bird
his
brown
curls
blowing
out
behind
him
as
his
baggy
yellow
thighs
and
thin
red
legs
flew
through
the
air
freckles
magnanimously
owned
himself
beaten
at
his
own
game
let
race
said
goggles
a
lean
swathy
boy
with
a
hooked
nose
and
bulging
black
eyes
like
a
flash
the
whole
lot
of
them
were
off
down
the
gravel
walk
under
the
elms
edgar
and
goggles
abreast
led
for
a
few
moments
then
edgar
gradually
gained
and
came
out
some
twenty
feet
ahead
of
goggles
and
double
that
ahead
of
the
foremost
of
the
others
it
was
not
only
these
accomplishments
in
themselves
that
made
the
american
boy
at
once
take
the
place
of
hero
and
leader
of
his
form
in
this
school
of
old
england
but
the
quiet
and
unassuming
mien
with
which
he
bore
his
superiority
not
seeming
in
the
least
to
despise
the
weakest
or
most
backward
of
his
competitors
and
initiating
them
all
into
the
little
secrets
of
his
success
in
performing
apparently
difficult
feats
it
was
the
same
way
with
his
lessons
without
apparent
effort
he
distanced
all
of
his
and
instead
of
pluming
himself
upon
it
was
always
ready
to
help
them
with
their
latin
or
their
sums
whose
answers
he
seemed
to
find
by
magic
almost
chapter
iv
during
the
winter
before
edgar
went
to
he
had
attended
an
infant
school
in
richmond
taught
by
a
somewhat
gaunt
but
spinster
with
big
spectacles
over
her
amiable
blue
eyes
a
starchy
cap
and
a
little
bunch
of
frosty
curls
on
each
side
of
her
face
as
a
child
she
had
played
with
allan
father
on
their
native
heath
in
ayrshire
and
to
her
little
edgar
was
always
her
ain
wee
laddie
she
had
spoiled
him
inordinately
and
unblushingly
also
as
she
contentedly
drew
at
the
pipe
filled
with
the
offerings
of
choice
which
he
frequently
turned
out
of
his
pockets
into
her
lap
she
had
taught
him
to
read
in
her
own
broad
scottish
accent
and
to
cypher
she
had
furthermore
drilled
him
in
making
pothooks
and
hangers
with
which
he
covered
his
slate
in
neat
rows
daily
but
it
was
at
the
manor
house
in
that
he
was
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
writing
his
hands
were
as
shapely
as
a
girl
with
deft
taper
fingers
that
seemed
made
to
hold
a
pen
or
brush
and
he
soon
developed
a
neat
small
but
beautifully
clear
and
graceful
this
new
accomplishment
became
at
once
a
delight
to
him
and
as
time
went
on
opened
a
new
world
to
edgar
the
dreamer
who
now
began
when
he
could
snatch
an
opportunity
to
do
so
unobserved
to
put
down
upon
paper
the
visions
of
his
awakening
soul
sometimes
these
scribblings
took
the
form
of
little
stories
crudely
conceived
and
incoherently
expressed
but
rich
in
the
picturesque
thought
and
language
of
an
exceptionably
imaginative
and
precocious
child
sometimes
they
were
in
verse
for
subjects
these
infant
effusions
had
generally
to
do
with
the
lonely
grave
in
the
churchyard
in
richmond
and
the
sad
joy
of
the
heart
that
mourns
evermore
with
the
beauty
of
flowers
the
more
beautiful
because
doomed
to
a
brief
life
with
the
gothic
steeple
asleep
in
the
still
blue
air
and
the
bell
in
whose
deep
iron
throat
dwelt
a
note
that
was
hollow
and
ghostly
with
the
great
wall
around
the
manor
house
grounds
and
with
the
mighty
gate
that
swung
upon
hinges
in
which
the
voice
of
a
soul
in
torment
seemed
to
be
imprisoned
and
with
other
things
which
filled
him
with
a
terror
that
was
not
fright
but
a
tremulous
delight
his
learning
to
write
bore
still
another
fruit
when
allan
had
first
adopted
him
and
set
apart
a
room
in
her
home
for
him
she
had
placed
in
a
little
cabinet
therein
the
packet
of
letters
his
dying
mother
had
given
him
she
had
not
opened
the
packet
for
she
felt
that
the
letters
were
for
the
actress
child
eye
alone
he
when
he
looked
at
it
did
so
with
a
feeling
of
mixed
reverence
and
fascination
which
was
deepened
by
his
inability
to
decipher
the
secrets
bound
together
by
the
bit
of
blue
ribbon
tied
around
it
how
the
sight
of
the
packet
recalled
to
him
that
sad
that
solemn
hour
in
which
it
had
been
given
into
his
hands
when
getting
him
ready
for
allan
had
packed
the
letters
with
his
other
belongings
for
she
was
a
woman
of
sentiment
and
she
felt
the
child
should
not
be
parted
from
this
gift
of
his
dying
mother
but
at
length
when
a
knowledge
of
writing
made
it
possible
for
him
to
read
the
letters
he
was
possessed
with
a
feeling
of
shrinking
from
doing
so
as
one
might
shrink
from
opening
a
message
from
the
grave
what
grim
what
terrible
secrets
might
not
the
little
bundle
of
letters
reveal
it
was
not
until
his
fifth
and
last
year
at
that
edgar
decided
one
day
to
look
into
the
packet
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
by
slight
indisposition
and
so
had
the
dormitory
to
himself
and
could
risk
opening
the
letters
without
fear
of
interruption
he
untied
the
blue
ribbon
and
the
thin
yellowed
papers
with
fragments
of
their
broken
seals
still
sticking
to
them
fell
apart
he
picked
up
the
one
bearing
the
earliest
date
and
began
to
read
it
was
from
his
father
to
his
mother
immediately
after
their
betrothal
his
interest
was
at
once
intensely
aroused
and
in
the
order
in
which
the
letters
came
he
read
and
read
and
read
with
the
absorption
with
which
he
might
have
read
his
first
novel
they
were
a
revelation
to
him
a
revelation
of
a
world
he
had
not
known
existed
though
it
seemed
it
lay
roundabout
him
these
of
his
parents
literally
throbbing
with
the
exalted
passion
of
two
young
ardent
poetic
spirits
the
boy
had
not
dreamed
that
anything
so
beautiful
could
be
as
this
undying
love
of
which
they
wrote
and
the
language
in
which
they
made
their
sweet
vows
to
each
other
his
own
heart
throbbed
in
answer
to
what
he
read
his
imagination
was
violently
wrought
upon
and
exquisite
feelings
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
awakened
in
his
breast
under
the
spell
of
the
letters
the
fell
in
love
not
with
any
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
for
his
entire
acquaintance
and
association
was
with
boys
but
with
the
ideal
of
his
inner
vision
from
that
time
his
poetic
outbursts
came
to
be
filled
with
more
than
aught
else
the
surpassing
beauty
the
worshipful
goodness
the
divine
love
of
woman
he
was
a
naturally
reverent
boy
but
for
these
more
than
mortal
beings
as
they
appeared
to
his
fancy
was
reserved
the
supreme
worship
of
his
romantic
soul
indeed
the
adoration
of
his
ideal
woman
perfect
in
body
in
mind
and
in
soul
became
and
was
to
be
always
a
religion
to
him
to
imagine
himself
rescuing
from
a
dark
prison
tower
hid
in
a
deep
wood
or
from
a
watery
grave
in
a
black
and
lake
at
midnight
some
lovely
maiden
whose
every
thought
and
would
thenceforth
be
for
him
alone
this
became
the
entrancing
inward
vision
of
edgar
the
dreamer
the
poet
the
lover
at
whom
edgar
goodfellow
with
whisper
as
insistent
as
the
voice
of
conscience
scoffed
and
sneered
seeking
to
make
him
ashamed
but
all
in
vain
of
course
it
was
to
follow
as
the
night
the
day
that
the
boy
would
find
someone
in
whom
to
dress
his
ideal
upon
a
sunday
soon
after
his
falling
in
love
he
saw
the
very
maiden
of
his
dreams
in
the
flesh
it
was
in
the
gothic
church
from
the
remote
pew
in
the
gallery
where
he
sat
with
his
he
looked
down
upon
a
wonderful
vision
of
white
and
gold
in
one
of
the
principal
pews
of
the
main
aisle
clad
all
in
white
and
with
a
shower
of
golden
tresses
falling
over
her
shoulders
she
was
like
a
glorious
lily
or
a
holy
angel
her
eyes
uplifted
in
the
rapture
of
worship
he
divined
rather
than
saw
were
of
the
hue
of
heaven
itself
he
loved
her
at
once
with
all
his
soul
might
her
name
her
home
these
were
mysteries
sacred
mysteries
whose
unfathomableness
but
added
to
her
charm
after
that
service
in
the
gothic
church
was
a
much
more
important
event
to
the
dreamer
than
before
an
event
looked
forward
to
with
trembling
from
sunday
to
sunday
after
that
too
upon
his
periodical
walks
with
the
school
he
would
look
up
at
the
quaint
old
homesteads
they
passed
with
their
hedged
gardens
ivied
walls
and
shrubberies
and
try
to
guess
which
was
the
in
which
she
dwelt
then
suddenly
one
sweet
may
afternoon
he
discovered
it
it
was
as
was
fitting
the
most
antique
the
most
distinguished
mansion
of
them
all
he
saw
her
through
the
bars
of
the
stately
entrance
gate
as
she
sat
beside
her
mother
on
a
tying
into
nosegays
the
flowers
that
filled
her
lap
stupified
by
the
shock
of
the
discovery
he
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
letting
his
go
on
ahead
of
him
she
was
much
nearer
him
than
she
had
been
in
the
dusky
church
and
upon
closer
view
she
seemed
even
more
lovely
more
more
angelic
than
ever
before
he
stared
upon
her
face
with
a
gaze
so
compelling
that
she
looked
up
and
smiled
at
him
then
with
sudden
impulse
gathered
her
flowers
in
her
apron
and
running
forward
handed
him
through
the
gate
a
fragrant
creamy
bud
that
she
happened
at
the
moment
to
have
in
her
hand
as
in
a
dream
he
stretched
his
fingers
for
it
he
tried
to
frame
an
expression
of
thanks
but
his
lips
were
dry
and
though
they
moved
no
sound
came
she
had
returned
at
once
to
her
seat
beside
her
mother
and
the
voice
of
the
usher
who
had
just
missed
him
sharply
calling
to
him
to
come
on
was
in
his
ears
he
hurried
forward
trembling
in
all
his
limbs
twice
he
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
the
bud
he
had
quickly
hidden
within
his
jacket
it
was
too
holy
a
thing
for
the
profane
eyes
of
his
to
look
upon
when
strength
and
reason
came
back
to
him
he
was
like
a
new
being
happiness
gave
wings
to
his
feet
and
he
walked
on
air
a
divine
song
seemed
to
be
singing
in
his
ears
mechanically
he
went
through
the
regular
routine
of
school
with
no
difference
that
others
could
see
to
himself
heart
and
soul
detached
and
divorced
from
his
body
seemed
soaring
in
a
new
and
beautiful
world
in
which
lessons
and
teachers
had
no
place
no
part
whenever
it
was
possible
for
him
to
do
so
unobserved
he
would
snatch
the
rose
from
his
bosom
and
kiss
and
caress
it
he
only
lived
to
see
sunday
come
round
but
on
the
next
sunday
and
the
next
she
was
absent
from
her
accustomed
place
such
a
thing
had
not
happened
before
since
he
had
first
seen
her
he
was
filled
with
the
first
real
anxiety
he
had
ever
known
here
was
a
mystery
in
which
there
was
no
charm
the
wednesday
after
the
second
sunday
upon
which
he
had
missed
her
was
a
day
dropped
out
of
heaven
the
mild
early
summer
air
that
floated
through
the
open
windows
into
the
gloomy
schoolroom
was
ambrosial
with
the
breathings
of
flowers
young
edgar
could
not
fix
his
thoughts
upon
the
page
before
him
the
world
was
calling
to
him
he
found
himself
listening
to
the
birds
in
the
trees
outside
and
gazing
through
the
narrow
pointed
windows
at
the
waving
branches
suddenly
his
heart
stopped
the
deep
sweet
hollow
ghostlike
voice
of
the
bell
in
the
steeple
tolling
for
a
funeral
was
borne
to
his
ears
in
a
moment
his
fevered
imagination
associated
the
tolling
with
the
absence
of
his
divinity
from
her
pew
and
in
spite
of
passionately
assuring
himself
that
it
could
not
be
and
recalling
how
lovely
and
full
of
health
she
had
been
when
he
saw
her
through
the
gate
he
was
possessed
by
deep
melancholy
the
days
and
hours
until
sunday
seemed
an
age
to
him
an
age
of
foreboding
and
dread
but
they
at
last
passed
by
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
he
walked
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
to
church
and
mounted
the
steps
to
the
school
gallery
it
was
early
few
of
the
worshippers
had
arrived
but
in
a
little
while
there
was
a
stir
near
the
door
a
group
of
figures
shrouded
in
the
black
habiliments
of
woe
were
moving
up
the
aisle
were
entering
pew
from
which
alas
was
again
absent
he
knew
that
she
would
enter
that
sacred
place
after
the
service
there
were
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
a
commotion
in
the
gallery
occupied
by
the
manor
house
school
and
it
was
said
in
reply
that
the
weather
being
excessively
hot
for
the
season
one
of
the
boys
had
fainted
chapter
the
june
following
young
edgar
eleventh
birthday
found
him
in
richmond
once
more
the
little
capital
was
all
greenery
and
roses
and
sunshine
and
and
laughter
and
he
felt
with
a
glow
that
it
was
good
to
be
back
in
the
five
years
of
his
absence
he
had
grown
quite
tall
for
his
age
with
a
certain
dignity
and
of
bearing
acquired
from
becoming
accustomed
to
depend
upon
himself
all
that
was
left
of
the
curls
that
used
to
flow
over
his
shoulders
were
the
clustering
ringlets
that
covered
his
head
and
framed
his
large
brow
his
absence
had
also
wrought
in
him
other
and
more
subtle
changes
which
did
not
appear
to
the
friends
who
remarked
upon
what
a
great
boy
he
had
grown
a
maturity
from
having
lived
in
another
world
from
having
had
his
thoughts
expanded
by
new
scenes
and
quickened
by
the
suggestions
of
historic
association
and
surroundings
but
with
his
return
england
and
sank
into
the
shadowy
past
their
spell
weakened
for
the
time
being
by
the
scenes
of
which
he
had
now
become
a
part
the
years
at
the
manor
house
school
were
as
a
dream
was
the
real
thing
was
home
ah
the
charm
of
that
word
and
all
it
implied
his
heart
swelled
his
eyes
grew
misty
as
he
said
it
over
and
over
to
himself
the
clatter
of
drays
down
town
was
like
music
in
his
ears
the
dusty
streets
of
the
residential
section
were
fair
to
his
eyes
for
old
time
sake
how
he
loved
the
very
pavement
under
his
feet
rough
and
uneven
as
it
was
how
dearly
he
loved
the
trees
that
he
had
climbed
and
would
climb
again
which
stretched
their
friendly
boughs
over
his
head
in
a
state
of
happy
excitement
he
rushed
about
town
visiting
his
old
haunts
to
see
if
they
were
still
there
and
the
same
comrade
his
brown
spaniel
his
favorite
of
all
his
pets
had
grown
old
and
sober
and
had
quite
forgotten
him
but
his
love
was
soon
reawakened
the
boys
he
had
played
with
too
had
almost
forgotten
him
but
his
return
called
him
to
mind
again
and
put
them
all
in
a
flutter
a
boy
who
had
lived
five
years
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
and
had
been
to
an
english
boarding
school
was
not
seen
in
richmond
every
day
allan
gave
him
a
party
to
which
all
of
the
children
in
their
circle
were
invited
in
anticipation
of
this
he
had
purchased
in
london
out
of
the
abundance
of
with
which
his
doting
always
saw
to
it
he
was
provided
a
number
of
little
gifts
to
be
distributed
among
the
boys
at
home
these
with
the
distinction
his
travels
gave
him
made
him
the
man
of
the
hour
among
richmond
children
and
how
much
he
had
to
tell
at
it
was
always
the
boys
at
home
that
were
the
heroes
of
the
stories
he
spun
by
the
yard
for
the
entertainment
of
his
the
literal
among
whom
had
come
to
believe
that
there
was
no
feat
a
virginia
boy
could
not
perform
now
that
he
was
in
richmond
the
boys
themselves
loomed
up
as
the
and
his
playmates
listened
with
admiration
and
with
such
expression
as
caesar
ghost
jiminy
cracky
and
the
like
as
he
narrated
his
tales
of
freckles
goggles
the
beau
and
the
rest
one
of
his
first
visits
after
reaching
home
was
to
his
old
black
mammy
in
the
tiny
cottage
with
its
prolific
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
in
which
allan
had
installed
her
and
her
husband
uncle
billy
before
leaving
virginia
mammy
was
expecting
him
with
one
half
of
her
attention
upon
the
white
cotton
socks
she
was
knitting
for
her
spouse
and
the
other
half
on
the
gate
of
her
small
garden
through
which
her
chile
would
come
she
sat
in
her
doorway
awaiting
him
she
was
splendidly
arrayed
in
her
new
purple
calico
and
a
big
white
apron
just
from
under
the
iron
her
gayest
bandanna
hankercher
covered
her
tightly
wropped
locks
from
view
and
the
snowiest
of
neckerchers
was
crossed
over
her
ample
bosom
her
kind
black
countenance
was
soft
with
thoughts
of
love
uncle
billy
too
was
spruced
for
the
occasion
indeed
he
was
quite
magnificent
in
a
biled
shut
with
ruffles
and
an
old
dresscoat
of
marster
his
were
elaborately
blacked
and
a
somewhat
battered
hat
crowned
his
bushy
grey
wool
each
of
the
old
folks
comfortably
smoked
a
pipe
mammy
saw
her
boy
coming
first
she
could
hardly
believe
it
was
he
he
was
so
tall
but
she
was
up
and
away
down
the
path
in
a
flash
to
the
gate
that
opened
on
the
little
back
street
she
met
him
and
enveloped
him
at
once
in
her
loving
arms
bless
de
lord
o
my
soul
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
a
sort
of
chant
as
she
held
him
against
her
bosom
and
rocked
back
and
forth
on
her
broad
feet
tears
of
joy
rolling
down
her
face

uncle

as
they
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
humble
abode
edgar
looked
around
upon
its
familiar
homely
snugness
with
satisfaction
at
the
huge
bed
covered
with
a
cheerful
log
cabin
quilt
made
of
scraps
of
calico
of
every
known
hue
and
pattern
at
the
walls
adorned
with
pictures
cut
from
old
books
and
magazines
at
the
shelf
as
mammy
called
the
with
its
lambrequin
of
scallopped
strips
of
newspaper
and
its
china
vases
filled
with
roses
and
pinks
at
the
spotless
bare
floor
and
homemade
chairs
at
the
small
but
bright
windows
with
their
rows
of
geraniums
and
verbenas
brilliantly
blooming
in
boxes
and
almost
all
that
mammy
could
say
was
lordy
lordy

risin
de
daid
skeery
sho
before
edgar
had
time
for
comment
upon
this
remarkable
apparition
mammy
set
before
him
the
snack
she
had
prepared
of
smoking
and
fresh
butter
on
her
best
china
plate
the
one
with
the
gilt
band
and
placed
at
his
right
hand
a
goblet
and
a
stone
pitcher
of
cool
a
luncheon
indeed
fit
to
be
set
before
royalty
though
it
is
not
likely
that
any
of
them
ever
had
such
an
one
offered
them
poor
things
edgar
did
full
justice
to
the
feast
and
was
warm
in
his
praises
of
it
then
before
taking
his
leave
he
placed
in
mammy
hands
a
parcel
containing
gifts
from
the
other
side
of
the
water
for
her
and
uncle
billy
there
is
nothing
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
an
negro
as
a
present
and
as
the
aged
couple
opened
the
package
and
drew
out
its
treasures
their
black
faces
fairly
shone
with
delight
mammy
could
not
forbear
giving
her
chile
a
hug
of
gratitude
and
freshly
springing
love
while
uncle
billy
heartily
declared
de
lord
will
bless
you
marster
fur
de
good
book
do
say
dat
he
do
love
one
chufful
giver
to
young
edgar
playmates
he
seemed
to
be
the
luckiest
boy
in
the
world
and
indeed
his
brief
existence
had
been
up
to
this
time
as
fortunate
as
it
appeared
to
them
even
the
beautiful
sorrow
of
his
mother
death
had
filled
his
life
with
poetry
and
brought
him
sympathy
and
affection
in
abundant
measure
but
bitterness
was
soon
enough
to
enter
his
soul
his
thoughts
from
the
moment
of
his
return
to
richmond
had
frequently
turned
to
the
white
church
and
churchyard
on
the
hill
and
to
the
grave
beside
the
wall
thither
he
was
determined
to
go
as
soon
as
he
possibly
could
but
it
was
too
sacred
a
pilgrimage
to
be
mentioned
to
anyone
it
must
be
as
secret
as
he
could
make
it
and
so
he
must
await
an
opportunity
to
slip
off
when
he
would
be
least
apt
to
be
missed
he
chose
a
sultry
afternoon
when
and
allan
were
taking
a
long
drive
into
the
country
he
waited
until
sunset
thinking
there
would
be
less
probability
of
meeting
anyone
in
the
churchyard
after
that
hour
than
earlier
and
set
out
taking
with
him
a
cluster
of
white
roses
from
the
in
the
garden
it
was
nearly
dusk
when
he
reached
the
church
and
climbed
the
steps
that
led
to
the
walled
graveyard
elevated
above
the
never
had
the
spot
looked
so
fair
to
him
the
white
spire
piercing
the
blue
sky
seemed
almost
to
touch
the
slender
new
moon
with
the
evening
star
glimmering
by
her
side
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
breath
of
roses
and
honeysuckle
and
the
graves
were
deeply
intensely
green
long
he
lay
upon
the
one
by
the
wall
near
the
head
of
which
he
had
placed
his
white
roses
looking
up
at
the
silver
spire
and
the
silver
star
and
the
silver
bow
so
long
that
he
forgot
the
passage
of
time
and
when
he
reached
home
and
went
in
out
of
the
night
to
the
bright
blinking
his
great
grey
eyes
to
accustom
them
to
the
supper
was
over
the
keen
eyes
of
john
allan
looked
sternly
upon
him
from
under
their
fierce
brows
the
boy
saw
at
once
that
his
was
very
angry
where
have
you
been
he
demanded
harshly
nowhere
replied
the
boy
what
have
you
been
doing
all
this
time
nothing
was
the
answer
nowhere
nothing
do
nowhere
and
nothing
me
sir
those
are
the
replies
the
lying
replies
of
a
boy
who
has
been
in
mischief
if
you
had
not
been
where
you
should
have
been
and
doing
as
you
have
done
you
would
not
be
ashamed
to
tell
now
sir
tell
me
at
once
where
you
have
been
and
what
you
have
been
doing
the
boy
grew
pale
but
made
no
reply
and
in
the
eyes
fixed
on
allan
face
was
a
provokingly
stubborn
look
the
man
wrath
waxed
warmer
his
voice
rose
in
a
tone
of
utter
exasperation
he
cried
tell
me
at
once
i
say
or
you
shall
have
the
severest
flogging
you
ever
had
in
your
life
the
boy
grew
paler
still
and
his
eyes
more
stubborn
a
scowl
settled
upon
his
brow
and
a
look
of
dogged
determination
about
his
mouth
but
still
he
spoke
not
a
word
allan
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
these
two
beings
husband
and
son
who
made
her
heart
world
the
evening
was
warm
and
she
wore
a
simple
white
dress
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
anxiety
clouded
her
lovely
face
yet
never
had
she
looked
more
girlishly
sweet
more
appealing
but
the
silent
plea
in
her
beautiful
troubled
eyes
was
lost
on
john
allan
much
as
he
loved
her
tell
him
eddie
dear
she
implored
do
be
afraid
speak
up
like
a
man
still
silence
she
walked
over
to
the
table
where
the
boy
sat
before
the
untouched
supper
that
had
been
saved
for
him
and
dropped
upon
one
knee
beside
him
she
placed
her
arm
around
him
and
drew
him
against
her
gentle
bosom
he
suffering
her
though
not
returning
the
caress
tell
eddie
darling
tell
mother
she
coaxed
the
grey
eyes
softened
the
brow
lifted
there
nothing
to
tell
mother
he
gently
replied
allan
rose
from
his
chair
i
give
you
five
minutes
in
which
to
find
something
to
tell
he
exclaimed
shaking
a
trembling
finger
at
the
culprit
then
stalked
out
of
the
room
in
his
absence
his
wife
fell
upon
the
neck
of
the
pale
frowning
child
covering
his
face
and
his
curly
head
with
kisses
and
beseeching
him
with
honeyed
endearments
to
be
a
good
boy
and
obey
his
father
but
the
little
figure
seemed
to
have
turned
to
stone
in
her
arms
in
less
than
the
five
minutes
allan
was
back
in
the
room
trimming
a
long
switch
cut
from
one
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
as
he
came
are
you
ready
to
tell
me
the
truth
he
demanded
no
answer
still
trimming
the
switch
he
approached
the
boy
frances
allan
trembled
rising
from
the
child
side
she
clasped
her
husband
arm
in
both
her
hands
do
john
do
please
john
dear
i
ca
stand
it
she
breathed
he
put
her
aside
firmly
do
be
silly
frances
you
are
interfering
with
my
duty
ca
you
see
that
i
must
teach
the
boy
to
make
you
a
better
return
for
your
kindness
than
lying
to
hide
his
mischief
but
suppose
that
he
is
telling
the
truth
john
and
that
he
has
been
doing
nothing
worse
than
wandering
about
the
streets
you
know
the
way
he
has
always
had
of
roaming
about
by
himself
at
times
and
do
you
think
roaming
about
the
streets
at
this
time
of
night
proper
employment
for
a
boy
of
eleven
would
you
have
him
grow
up
into
a
vagabond
a
boy
dependent
upon
the
bounty
of
strangers
can
ill
afford
to
cultivate
such
idle
habits
the
boy
already
large
and
dark
pupils
dilated
and
darkened
until
his
eyes
looked
like
black
pools
his
already
white
face
grew
livid
he
drew
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
and
fixed
upon
his
a
gaze
in
which
every
spark
of
affection
was
for
the
moment
dead
he
had
been
humiliated
by
the
threat
of
a
flogging
but
the
prospect
of
the
hardest
stroke
his
body
might
receive
was
as
nothing
to
him
now
his
sensitive
soul
had
been
smitten
a
blow
the
smart
of
which
he
would
carry
with
him
to
his
last
day
dependent
upon
the
bounty
of
strangers
strangers
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
the
darling
little
son
of
an
mother
and
though
his
had
been
at
times
stern
and
unsympathetic
with
him
no
hint
had
ever
before
dropped
from
him
to
indicate
that
the
child
was
not
as
much
his
own
as
the
sons
of
other
fathers
were
their
own
that
he
was
not
as
much
entitled
to
the
good
things
of
life
which
were
heaped
upon
him
without
the
asking
as
an
own
son
would
have
been
his
comforts
his
pleasures
had
been
so
easily
so
plentifully
bestowed
that
the
little
dreamer
had
never
before
awaked
to
a
realization
of
a
difference
between
his
relation
with
his
parents
and
the
relation
of
other
children
with
theirs
brought
face
to
face
with
this
hard
cold
fact
for
the
first
time
and
so
suddenly
he
was
for
the
moment
stunned
by
it
he
felt
that
a
flood
of
deep
waters
in
which
he
was
floundering
helplessly
was
overwhelming
him
a
deep
silence
had
followed
the
last
words
of
allan
who
continued
to
trim
the
switch
while
his
wife
sinking
into
a
chair
bowed
her
face
in
her
arms
folded
upon
the
table
and
began
to
cry
softly
the
gentle
sounds
of
her
weeping
seemed
but
further
to
infuriate
her
husband
come
with
me
he
commanded
placing
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
child
who
unresistingly
suffered
himself
to
be
pushed
along
toward
his
room
frances
allan
broke
into
wild
sobbing
and
placed
her
fingers
against
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
the
screams
of
her
pet
but
there
were
no
screams
silently
and
with
an
air
of
dignity
it
was
marvellous
so
small
a
figure
could
command
the
beautiful
boy
received
the
blows
when
one
soul
has
been
hurt
what
matters
mere
physical
pain
when
both
the
strength
and
the
passion
of
allan
had
been
somewhat
spent
he
ceased
laying
on
blows
and
asked
in
a
calmed
voice
are
you
ready
to
tell
me
the
truth
now
in
one
moment
of
time
the
child
lived
over
again
the
beautiful
hour
at
his
mother
grave
he
saw
again
the
silver
spire
and
the
silver
and
the
silver
star
smelled
the
blended
odors
of
honeysuckle
and
rose
made
sweeter
by
the
gathering
dews
and
felt
the
coolness
and
freshness
of
the
long
green
grass
that
covered
the
grave
who
knew
but
that
deep
down
under
the
sweet
grass
she
had
been
conscious
he
was
there
had
felt
his
heart
beat
and
heard
his
loving
whispers
as
of
old
and
loved
him
still
and
understood
though
she
would
see
him
nevermore
share
the
secret
of
that
holy
hour
with
anyone
of
all
people
with
this
wrathful
blind
unsympathizing
man
who
had
just
confessed
himself
a
stranger
to
him
never
a
faint
smile
full
of
peace
settled
upon
his
poet
face
but
he
answered
never
a
word
there
was
a
stir
at
the
door
john
allan
looked
toward
it
his
wife
stood
there
drying
her
eyes
he
turned
to
the
boy
again
go
with
your
mother
and
get
your
supper
he
commanded
i
do
want
it
was
the
reply
well
go
to
bed
then
and
tomorrow
afternoon
you
are
to
spend
in
your
own
room
where
i
hope
meditation
upon
your
idle
ways
may
bring
you
to
something
like
repentance
the
boy
paused
to
the
door
tomorrow
is
the
day
i
going
swimming
with
the
boys
you
promised
that
i
might
go
well
i
take
back
the
promise
that
all
do
you
think
you
punished
him
enough
for
this
time
john
timidly
asked
his
wife
no
boy
is
ever
punished
enough
until
he
is
conquered
was
the
reply
and
edgar
is
far
from
that
allan
with
her
arm
about
the
little
culprit
shoulder
went
with
him
to
his
room
how
she
wished
that
he
would
let
her
cuddle
him
in
her
lap
and
sing
to
him
and
tell
him
stories
and
then
hear
him
his
prayers
at
her
knee
and
tuck
him
in
bed
as
in
the
old
days
before
he
went
to
her
heart
ached
for
him
though
she
had
no
notion
of
the
bitterness
the
rebellion
that
were
rankling
in
his
as
she
kissed
him
goodnight
she
whispered
you
shall
have
your
swim
in
the
river
tomorrow
eddie
darling
see
that
you
do
do
you
ask
to
let
me
do
anything
he
protested
passionately
i
going
without
asking
him
he
disowned
me
for
a
son
i
disown
him
for
a
father
he
loved
her
but
he
was
glad
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
so
that
he
could
think
it
all
out
for
himself
in
the
dark
the
dear
dark
that
he
had
always
loved
so
well
and
that
was
now
as
balm
to
his
bruised
spirit
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
disown
john
allan
as
a
father
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
with
renewed
bitterness
that
he
was
indeed
and
by
no
fault
of
his
own
a
helpless
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
this
man
who
had
in
taunting
him
with
the
fact
wounded
him
so
grievously
his
impulse
was
to
run
away
but
where
could
he
go
though
his
small
purse
held
at
that
moment
a
generous
amount
of
spending
money
for
a
boy
going
on
twelve
it
would
be
a
mere
nothing
toward
taking
him
anywhere
it
would
not
afford
him
shelter
and
food
for
a
day
and
he
knew
it
it
would
not
take
him
to
the
only
place
where
he
knew
he
had
kindred
baltimore
and
what
if
he
could
get
as
far
as
baltimore
would
he
care
to
go
there
to
assert
his
independence
of
the
charity
of
john
allan
only
to
throw
himself
upon
the
charity
of
relatives
who
had
never
noticed
him
whom
he
hated
because
they
had
never
forgiven
his
father
for
marrying
the
angel
mother
around
whose
memory
his
fondest
dreams
clung
no
he
could
not
disown
allan
not
yet
but
the
good
things
of
life
received
from
his
hands
had
henceforth
lost
their
flavor
and
would
be
like
dead
sea
fruit
upon
his
lips
hitherto
though
he
knew
of
course
that
he
was
not
the
allans
own
child
he
had
never
once
been
made
to
feel
that
he
was
any
the
less
entitled
to
their
bounty
they
had
adopted
him
of
their
own
free
will
to
fill
the
empty
arms
of
a
woman
with
a
mother
heart
who
had
never
been
a
mother
and
that
woman
had
lavished
upon
him
almost
more
than
a
mother
love
certainly
more
than
a
prudent
mother
indulgence
he
had
been
the
most
spoiled
and
petted
child
of
his
circle
and
the
bounty
had
been
heaped
upon
him
in
a
manner
that
made
him
feel
child
though
he
was
the
joy
that
the
giving
brought
the
giver
and
therefore
no
burden
of
obligation
upon
himself
in
receiving
if
allan
had
been
strict
to
a
point
of
harshness
with
him
at
times
allan
was
a
born
disciplinarian
it
seemed
natural
for
him
to
be
stern
and
unsympathetic
and
those
who
knew
him
best
took
his
stiffness
and
hardness
with
many
grains
of
allowance
remembering
his
upright
life
and
his
charities
he
had
administered
punishment
upon
the
little
lad
when
he
was
naughty
in
the
years
before
he
went
away
to
school
and
the
little
lad
had
taken
his
medicine
philosophically
like
other
naughty
boys
had
cried
lustily
then
dried
his
eyes
and
forgotten
all
about
it
in
the
pleasure
which
the
goodies
and
petting
he
always
had
from
his
pretty
at
such
times
gave
him
but
was
different
he
was
a
big
lad
now
very
big
and
old
he
felt
far
too
big
to
be
flogged
quite
big
enough
to
visit
his
grave
if
he
chose
without
having
to
talk
about
it
and
he
had
not
only
been
flogged
because
he
would
not
reveal
his
sacred
sweet
secret
but
had
had
his
dependence
upon
charity
thrown
up
at
him
henceforth
he
felt
his
life
would
be
a
lonely
one
for
he
now
knew
that
he
was
different
from
other
boys
all
of
whom
in
his
acquaintance
had
fathers
to
whose
bounty
they
had
a
right
the
right
of
sonship
yes
he
was
a
very
big
boy
he
told
himself
and
he
had
not
cried
when
he
was
flogged
but
under
the
cover
of
the
kindly
dark
hot
tears
of
indignation
hurt
pride
and
pity
for
his
own
loneliness
his
singularity
made
all
his
pillow
wet
comfort
came
to
him
from
an
unexpected
source
the
door
of
his
room
had
been
closed
but
not
latched
it
was
now
pushed
open
by
comrade
his
old
spaniel
who
made
straight
for
his
side
first
pushing
his
nose
against
his
face
and
then
leaping
upon
the
bed
and
nestling
down
close
to
him
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
desolate
boy
welcomed
this
dumb
affectionate
companionship
the
feel
of
the
warm
soft
body
and
the
thought
of
the
velvety
brown
eyes
which
he
could
not
see
in
the
dark
but
knew
were
fixed
upon
him
with
their
intense
loving
gaze
were
soothing
to
his
overwrought
nerves
here
was
something
whose
love
could
be
counted
upon
something
as
dependent
upon
him
as
he
was
upon
allan
yet
what
a
joy
he
found
in
the
very
dependence
of
this
devoted
creature
never
would
he
taunt
comrade
with
his
dependence
upon
charity
no
he
said
his
hands
deep
in
the
silky
coat
i
would
not
insult
a
dog
as
he
has
insulted
me
never
mind
comrade
old
fellow
we
have
our
swim
in
the
river
tomorrow
and
he
may
flog
me
again
if
he
likes
but
he
was
not
flogged
the
next
day
an
important
business
engagement
occupied
allan
the
whole
afternoon
and
when
he
came
in
late
tired
and
he
found
edgar
fresh
and
glowing
from
his
exercise
in
the
river
the
curls
still
damp
upon
his
forehead
quietly
eating
his
supper
with
his
mother
knew
but
tender
creature
that
she
was
she
was
prepared
to
do
anything
short
of
fibbing
to
shield
her
pet
from
another
but
john
allan
still
absorbed
in
business
cares
hardly
looked
toward
the
boy
and
asked
not
a
question
chapter
vi
the
home
of
the
allans
was
never
quite
the
same
to
edgar
poe
after
that
night
a
wall
had
been
raised
between
him
and
his
that
would
never
be
scaled
he
was
still
indulged
in
a
generous
amount
of
pocket
money
which
he
invariably
proceeded
to
get
rid
of
as
fast
as
he
could
lavishing
it
upon
the
enjoyment
of
his
friends
as
freely
as
it
had
been
lavished
upon
him
he
had
plenty
of
pets
and
toys
went
to
dancing
school
in
which
his
natural
love
of
dancing
made
him
delight
and
was
given
stiff
but
merry
little
parties
at
which
old
cy
the
black
fiddler
played
and
called
the
figures
and
the
little
host
and
his
friends
conformed
to
the
strict
ceremonious
etiquette
observed
by
the
children
as
well
as
the
grown
people
of
the
day
for
these
indulgences
frances
allan
was
chiefly
responsible
the
one
weak
spot
in
the
armor
of
austerity
in
which
john
allan
clothed
himself
was
his
love
for
his
wife
and
it
was
often
against
what
he
felt
to
be
his
better
judgment
that
he
acquiesced
in
her
system
of
he
felt
a
solemn
responsibility
toward
the
boy
and
he
did
his
duty
by
him
as
he
saw
it
faithfully
it
was
not
in
the
least
his
fault
that
he
did
see
that
under
the
broad
white
brow
and
sunny
ringlets
was
a
brain
in
which
like
the
sky
in
a
a
whole
world
was
reflected
with
ever
changing
pageantry
and
that
the
abstracted
expression
in
the
boy
eyes
that
he
thought
could
only
mean
that
he
was
hatching
mischief
really
indicated
that
the
creative
faculty
in
budding
genius
was
awake
and
at
work
for
a
child
edgar
age
to
be
making
trials
at
writing
poetry
allan
regarded
as
sheer
idleness
to
be
promptly
suppressed
indeed
when
he
discovered
that
the
boy
had
been
guilty
of
such
foolishness
he
emphatically
ordered
him
not
to
repeat
it
to
counteract
the
effects
of
his
wife
spoiling
of
her
adopted
son
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
place
all
manner
of
restrictions
upon
his
liberty
which
the
boy
with
the
connivance
of
his
mother
and
the
negro
servants
who
adored
him
disregarded
whenever
it
was
possible
though
bathing
in
the
river
was
except
upon
rare
occasions
prohibited
edgar
became
before
summer
was
over
the
most
expert
swimmer
and
diver
of
his
years
in
town
and
many
an
afternoon
when
allan
supposed
that
he
was
in
his
room
to
which
he
had
been
ordered
for
the
purpose
of
disciplining
his
will
and
character
or
for
punishment
he
was
far
beyond
the
city
limits
roaming
the
woods
the
fields
or
the
joyously
and
without
a
prick
of
conscience
for
all
his
disobedience
feeding
his
growing
soul
upon
the
beauties
of
tree
and
sky
and
cliff
and
and
so
in
spite
of
the
melancholy
moods
in
which
he
was
occasionally
plunged
by
the
bitterness
which
had
found
lodgment
in
his
breast
the
summer
was
upon
the
whole
a
happy
one
to
the
boy
he
was
so
young
and
the
world
was
so
beautiful
he
could
not
remember
always
to
be
unhappy
edgar
goodfellow
as
well
as
edgar
the
dreamer
revelled
in
the
world
of
to
the
one
all
manner
of
muscular
sport
and
exercise
was
as
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
to
the
other
whose
favorite
stories
were
ancient
myths
and
all
natural
phenomena
possessed
vivid
personality
he
loved
to
trace
pictures
in
the
clouds
in
the
rustling
of
corn
or
the
stirring
of
leaves
in
the
trees
or
in
the
sound
of
running
waters
he
heard
voices
which
spoke
to
him
of
delightsome
things
bringing
to
his
full
grey
eyes
as
he
hearkened
a
soft
romantic
look
and
touching
his
lips
and
his
cheeks
with
a
radiant
spirituality
the
cottage
on
clay
street
to
which
the
allans
had
removed
soon
after
their
return
from
england
was
in
a
quiet
part
of
the
town
the
window
of
edgar
own
quaint
little
room
in
the
dormer
roof
with
its
shelving
walls
gave
him
a
fair
view
of
the
sky
and
brought
him
sweet
airs
wafted
across
the
garden
of
flowers
below
here
such
hours
as
he
spent
from
choice
or
by
command
were
not
lonely
for
sitting
by
the
little
window
many
a
story
or
poem
was
thought
out
or
buried
in
some
favorite
book
his
thoughts
would
be
borne
away
as
if
on
wings
to
a
world
where
imagination
was
king
in
the
fall
he
was
entered
at
clarke
school
the
with
its
walls
and
the
sun
pouring
in
unrestricted
through
the
commonplace
big
bare
windows
was
very
different
from
the
great
gloomy
gothic
room
at
old
so
full
of
mystery
and
suggestion
but
edgar
found
it
a
pleasant
place
in
which
to
be
upon
that
cool
fresh
morning
in
late
september
when
he
made
its
acquaintance
he
felt
full
of
mental
activity
and
ready
to
go
to
work
with
a
will
upon
his
latin
his
french
and
his
mathematics
since
his
return
from
england
in
june
he
had
become
acquainted
with
most
of
the
boys
who
were
to
be
his
and
he
took
at
once
to
the
professor
clarke
of
trinity
college
dublin
a
bachelor
of
irish
birth
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
a
very
human
creature
with
a
big
heart
a
high
ideal
of
what
boys
might
be
and
abundant
tolerance
of
what
they
generally
were
if
he
had
a
quick
temper
he
had
also
a
quick
wit
and
a
quick
appreciation
of
talent
and
sympathy
with
timorous
aspirations
it
had
been
master
clarke
suggestion
that
his
new
pupil
who
was
known
as
edgar
allan
should
put
his
own
name
upon
the
school
register
edgar
looking
questioningly
up
into
allan
face
was
glad
to
read
approval
there
and
with
a
thrill
of
pride
he
wrote
upon
the
book
in
the
small
clear
hand
that
had
become
characteristic
of
him
edgar
allan
poe
he
was
proud
of
his
name
and
proud
of
his
father
of
whom
he
remembered
nothing
but
in
whose
veins
he
knew
had
run
patriot
blood
and
who
had
had
the
independence
to
risk
all
for
love
of
the
beautiful
mother
of
worshipped
memory
it
was
with
straightened
shoulders
and
a
high
head
that
he
took
the
seat
assigned
him
at
the
clumsy
desk
in
the
bare
ugly
room
of
the
school
in
which
he
was
to
be
known
for
the
first
time
as
he
felt
that
in
coming
into
his
own
name
he
had
come
into
a
proud
heritage
clarke
irish
heart
warmed
toward
him
he
divined
in
the
boy
a
unique
and
gifted
personality
and
proceeded
with
the
uttermost
tact
to
do
his
best
toward
the
cultivation
of
his
talents
the
result
was
that
edgar
not
only
acquitted
himself
brilliantly
in
his
studies
but
progressed
well
in
his
which
though
since
allan
prohibition
it
had
been
kept
secret
in
his
home
was
freely
acknowledged
to
teacher
and
by
his
he
was
deemed
a
wonder
he
was
so
easily
first
among
them
in
everything
in
the
simple
athletics
with
which
they
were
familiar
as
well
as
in
studies
and
his
talent
for
rhyming
and
drawing
seemed
to
set
him
upon
a
sort
of
pedestal
in
the
first
blush
of
triumph
these
little
successes
gave
him
young
edgar
head
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
turned
he
saw
himself
in
fancy
the
leader
the
popular
favorite
of
the
whole
school
indeed
he
flattered
himself
he
had
leaped
at
a
single
bound
to
this
position
at
the
moment
almost
of
his
entrance
but
he
soon
began
to
see
that
he
was
mistaken
while
he
was
conscious
of
the
unconcealed
admiration
of
most
and
the
envy
of
a
few
of
the
boys
of
his
mental
and
physical
abilities
he
began
as
time
went
on
to
suspect
then
to
be
sure
that
for
some
reason
that
baffled
all
his
ingenuity
to
fathom
he
was
not
accorded
the
position
in
the
school
that
was
the
natural
reward
for
superiority
of
endowment
and
performance
this
place
was
filled
instead
by
nat
howard
a
boy
who
he
told
himself
he
was
without
the
slightest
vanity
bound
to
see
was
distinctly
second
to
him
in
every
way
he
noticed
that
whatever
nat
proposed
was
invariably
done
so
that
he
was
forced
either
to
follow
where
he
should
have
led
or
be
left
out
of
everything
often
when
he
joined
the
boys
listening
with
interest
to
nat
heavy
jokes
and
talk
a
silence
would
fall
upon
the
company
which
in
a
short
while
would
break
up
the
boys
going
off
in
twos
and
threes
leaving
him
to
his
own
society
or
that
of
a
small
minority
composed
of
two
or
three
boys
for
the
most
part
younger
than
himself
who
in
spite
of
the
popular
taste
for
nat
preferred
him
and
were
captivated
by
his
clever
accomplishments
that
there
was
some
reason
why
he
was
thus
shut
out
from
personal
intimacy
by
who
acknowledged
and
admired
his
powers
he
felt
sure
and
he
was
determined
to
ferrit
it
out
in
the
meantime
his
heart
always
peculiarly
responsive
to
affection
answered
with
warmth
to
the
devotion
of
the
small
coterie
who
were
independent
enough
to
swear
fealty
to
him
he
helped
them
with
their
lessons
initiated
them
into
the
mysteries
of
boxing
and
other
manly
exercises
went
swimming
and
gunning
with
them
and
occasionally
delighted
them
by
showing
them
his
poems
and
the
little
sketches
with
which
he
sometimes
illustrated
his
manuscript
in
the
making
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
was
little
in
these
compositions
to
set
the
world
afire
they
would
only
be
counted
remarkable
as
the
work
of
a
in
his
early
teens
and
were
practice
work
nothing
more
they
served
their
purpose
then
sank
into
the
oblivion
which
was
their
meet
destiny
but
to
jack
preston
dick
ambler
rob
stanard
and
rob
sully
and
one
or
two
others
they
were
these
boys
as
well
as
edgar
were
giving
serious
attention
to
their
linen
the
care
of
their
hands
and
the
precise
parting
of
their
hair
just
then
and
a
close
observer
might
often
have
detected
them
in
the
act
of
furtively
feeling
their
upper
lips
with
anxious
forefinger
in
the
vain
hope
of
discovering
the
appearance
if
ever
so
slight
of
a
downy
growth
thereupon
for
they
as
well
as
he
were
making
sheep
eyes
at
those
wonderful
visions
in
golden
locks
and
jetty
locks
with
brown
eyes
and
blue
eyes
with
fluttering
ribbons
and
snowy
pinafores
known
as
miss
jane
mackenzie
girls
who
were
the
inspiration
of
most
of
their
invocations
of
the
muse
the
little
hymns
in
praise
of
the
charms
of
these
girls
were
generally
adorned
with
pen
or
pencil
sketches
of
the
fair
charmers
themselves
poor
miss
jane
had
a
sad
time
of
it
as
the
accomplished
principal
of
a
choice
young
ladies
boarding
and
day
school
she
enjoyed
an
enviable
position
in
the
politest
society
in
town
parents
of
young
ladies
under
her
care
congratulated
themselves
alike
upon
her
strict
rule
and
her
learning
her
refinement
of
manners
and
conversation
and
her
distinguished
appearance
she
was
tall
and
stately
and
in
her
decorous
garb
of
black
silk
that
could
have
stood
alone
and
an
elegant
cap
of
real
lace
with
lavender
ribbons
softening
the
precise
waves
of
her
hair
she
made
a
most
impressive
figure
one
that
would
have
inspired
with
profound
respect
any
male
creature
living
saving
that
incorrigible
of
persons
and
personages
especially
of
lady
principals
the
boy
for
the
forming
of
young
ladies
miss
jane
had
a
positive
forte
but
the
genus
boy
was
an
unknown
quantity
to
her
and
worse
he
was
a
positive
terror
for
one
of
them
to
invade
the
sacred
precincts
of
her
school
or
its
grounds
seemed
to
her
maiden
soul
rank
sacrilege
to
scale
her
garden
wall
after
dark
for
the
purpose
of
attaching
a
letter
to
a
string
let
down
from
a
window
to
receive
it
was
nothing
short
of
criminal
for
one
of
her
girls
to
receive
offerings
of
candy
and
original
poetry
from
one
of
these
terrible
creatures
such
an
offence
was
unspeakably
shocking
yet
discovery
of
such
offences
happened
often
enough
to
give
her
repeated
shocks
and
to
confirm
her
in
her
belief
in
the
total
depravity
the
hopeless
wickedness
of
all
boys
especially
of
john
allan
adopted
son
in
spite
of
her
vigilance
edgar
poe
found
the
means
to
outwit
her
and
to
transmit
his
effusions
without
difficulty
to
her
fair
charges
who
with
tresses
primly
parted
and
braided
and
meek
eyes
bent
in
evident
absorption
upon
their
books
were
the
very
pictures
of
docile
obedience
and
bore
in
their
outward
looks
no
hint
of
the
guilty
consciences
that
should
by
rights
have
been
destroying
their
peace
miss
jane
was
the
sister
of
mackenzie
who
had
adopted
little
rosalie
poe
rosalie
was
at
miss
jane
invitation
a
pupil
in
the
school
but
ungrateful
girl
that
she
was
she
became
at
the
suggestion
of
her
handsome
and
charming
brother
edgar
whom
she
adored
the
willing
messenger
of
dan
cupid
and
furthered
much
secret
and
sentimental
correspondence
between
the
girls
and
the
young
scamps
who
admired
them
in
these
fascinating
flights
into
the
realms
of
flirtation
as
in
other
things
edgar
friends
acknowledged
his
superiority
his
romantic
personal
beauty
and
his
gift
for
rhyming
giving
him
a
decided
advantage
over
them
all
but
they
acknowledged
it
without
jealousy
for
there
was
much
of
hero
worship
in
their
attitude
toward
him
and
they
were
not
only
perfectly
contented
for
him
to
be
first
in
every
way
but
it
would
have
disappointed
them
for
him
not
to
be
the
captivating
charm
of
his
presence
in
his
gay
moods
made
it
unalloyed
happiness
for
them
to
be
with
him
they
were
always
ready
to
follow
him
as
far
as
he
led
in
daring
adventure
ready
to
fetch
and
carry
for
him
and
glowing
with
pride
at
the
least
notice
from
him
some
boys
would
have
taken
advantage
of
this
state
of
things
but
not
so
edgar
goodfellow
he
for
his
part
was
always
ready
to
contribute
to
their
pleasure
and
fairly
sunned
himself
in
the
unstinting
love
and
praise
of
these
boys
who
admired
while
but
half
divining
his
gifts
their
games
had
twice
the
zest
when
eddie
played
with
them
he
threw
himself
into
the
sport
with
such
heartfelt
zeal
that
they
were
inspired
to
do
their
best
many
a
ramble
in
the
woods
and
fields
around
richmond
he
took
with
them
telling
them
the
most
wonderful
stories
as
he
went
along
but
sometimes
quite
suddenly
during
these
outings
edgar
goodfellow
would
give
place
to
edgar
the
dreamer
and
they
would
wonderingly
realize
that
his
thoughts
were
off
to
a
world
where
none
of
them
could
follow
none
of
them
unless
it
were
rob
sully
who
was
himself
something
of
a
dreamer
and
could
draw
as
well
as
edgar
the
transformation
would
be
respected
his
companions
would
look
at
him
with
something
akin
to
awe
in
their
eyes
and
tell
each
other
in
low
tones
not
to
disturb
eddie
he
was
making
poetry
and
confine
their
chatter
to
themselves
holding
rather
aloof
from
the
young
poet
who
wandered
on
with
the
abstracted
gaze
of
one
walking
in
sleep
with
them
but
not
of
them
there
were
other
less
frequent
times
when
his
mood
was
as
much
respected
when
added
to
the
awe
there
was
somewhat
of
distress
in
their
attitude
toward
him
at
these
times
he
was
not
only
abstracted
but
a
deep
gloom
would
seem
to
have
settled
upon
his
spirit
without
apparent
reason
melancholy
claimed
him
and
though
he
was
still
gentle
and
courteous
they
had
a
nameless
sort
of
fear
of
him
he
was
so
unlike
other
boys
and
it
seemed
such
a
strange
thing
to
be
unhappy
about
nothing
it
was
positively
uncanny
at
these
times
they
did
not
even
try
to
be
with
him
they
knew
that
he
could
wrestle
with
what
he
called
his
blue
devils
more
successfully
alone
a
restlessness
generally
accompanied
the
mood
and
he
would
wander
off
by
himself
to
the
churchyard
the
river
or
the
woods
or
spend
whole
long
golden
afternoons
shut
up
in
his
room
poring
over
some
quaint
old
tale
or
writing
furiously
upon
a
composition
of
his
own
when
he
looked
at
the
boys
he
did
not
seem
to
see
them
but
would
gaze
beyond
them
the
pupils
of
his
full
soft
grey
eyes
darkening
and
dilating
as
if
they
were
held
by
some
weird
vision
invisible
to
all
eyes
save
his
own
and
indeed
the
belief
was
general
among
his
friends
that
he
was
endowed
with
the
power
of
seeing
visions
this
impression
had
been
made
even
upon
his
old
mammy
when
he
was
a
mite
of
a
lad
many
a
time
when
he
turned
that
abstracted
gaze
upon
her
she
had
said
to
him
what
dat
you
lookin
at
now
honey
you
is
bawn
to
see
evil
sho
and
now
a
glimpse
of
edgar
goodfellow
the
normal
edgar
whom
his
chums
saw
oftenest
and
loved
best
because
they
knew
him
best
and
understood
him
best
it
was
a
late
autumn
saturday
one
of
the
saturdays
sent
from
heaven
for
the
delight
of
bracing
but
not
cold
and
brilliant
little
robert
sully
looked
pensively
out
of
the
window
thinking
what
a
fine
day
it
would
be
for
a
country
tramp
if
only
he
were
like
other
boys
and
could
take
them
but
rob
was
of
frail
build
and
constitution
and
could
never
stand
much
exertion
in
his
eyes
was
the
expression
of
settled
wistfulness
that
frequent
disappointment
will
bring
to
the
eyes
of
a
delicate
child
in
the
droop
of
his
mouth
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
for
he
was
thinking
that
not
only
did
his
weak
body
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
keep
up
with
the
boys
but
that
it
was
no
doubt
a
relief
to
the
boys
to
leave
him
behind
that
when
he
could
be
with
them
he
was
perhaps
a
drag
on
their
pleasure
no
doubt
they
would
make
a
long
day
of
it
this
bright
bracing
saturday
for
the
persimmons
and
the
were
ripe
and
the
chinquapin
and
chestnut
burrs
were
opening
tears
of
sprang
to
his
eyes
but
they
were
quickly
dashed
away
as
he
heard
his
name
called
and
saw
his
beloved
eddie
flushed
and
glowing
with
anticipated
pleasure
at
the
gate
come
along
rob
he
was
calling
we
are
going
to
the
hermitage
woods
for
chinquapins
and
you
must
come
too
uncle
billy
is
going
for
a
load
of
and
we
can
ride
in
his
wagon
so
it
wo
tire
you
the
other
boys
were
waiting
at
the
corner
all
at
the
highest
pitch
of
mirth
for
they
saw
that
their
idol
eddie
was
in
one
of
his
happiest
moods
which
would
mean
a
morning
of
unbounded
fun
to
them
and
the
ride
with
old
uncle
billy
who
with
black
and
shiny
face
beaming
upon
them
in
an
excess
of
kindliness
hair
like
a
and
quaint
talk
was
an
unfailing
source
of
delight
to
them
the
saturday
freedom
was
in
their
blood
off
and
away
they
went
in
the
jolly
rumbling
wagon
past
houses
and
gardens
and
fields
and
into
the
enchanting
woods
where
bob
whites
were
calling
to
each
other
and
nuts
were
dropping
in
the
rustling
leaves
or
waiting
to
be
shaken
from
their
open
burrs
as
they
jolted
along
the
steady
stream
of
conversation
between
edgar
and
uncle
billy
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
the
rest
of
the
boys
edgar
with
grave
courteous
manner
discoursing
of
cunjurs
and
with
as
real
an
air
of
belief
as
that
of
the
old
man
himself
chapter
vii
the
allegiance
of
his
little
band
of
boon
companions
was
all
the
sweeter
to
the
young
poet
because
he
realized
more
and
more
fully
as
the
years
of
his
passed
that
for
some
reason
unknown
to
himself
he
was
systematically
and
plainly
with
intention
denied
intimacy
with
nat
howard
and
his
followers
as
has
been
said
they
did
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
his
success
in
all
sorts
of
mental
and
physical
trials
of
skill
but
in
a
formal
impersonal
way
there
was
never
the
least
familiarity
in
their
intercourse
with
him
this
naturally
produced
in
him
a
reserve
in
his
manner
toward
them
that
they
unreasonably
attributed
to
airs
their
coldness
wounded
and
chilled
the
sensitive
boy
as
much
as
the
love
of
his
devoted
adherents
warmed
him
it
was
not
until
near
the
end
of
his
third
session
in
the
school
that
the
riddle
was
quite
suddenly
solved
edgar
poe
was
now
in
his
fifteenth
year
one
perfect
may
day
when
the
song
of
birds
the
odors
of
flowers
the
whisper
of
soft
breezes
and
the
languor
of
mellow
sunshine
outside
of
the
open
school
windows
were
wooing
all
poetic
souls
to
come
out
and
live
and
let
musty
dry
books
go
to
the
deuce
little
rob
sully
found
it
impossible
to
fix
his
mind
upon
his
latin
as
for
edgar
mind
it
was
plain
from
his
expression
that
it
was
far
afield
but
then
edgar
had
the
power
of
knowing
his
lessons
intuitively
almost
rob
only
got
his
by
faithful
plodding
when
their
respective
classes
were
called
edgar
recited
brilliantly
while
rob
seemed
like
one
befuddled
and
making
a
dismal
failure
was
bidden
to
stay
in
and
study
at
recess
a
look
of
utter
woe
settled
upon
his
thin
pallid
face
which
lifted
as
impelled
to
look
toward
edgar
desk
he
caught
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
with
their
charming
smile
he
knew
well
what
the
eyes
were
saying
do
worry
rob
i
stay
in
and
help
you
and
stay
in
the
owner
of
the
eyes
did
patiently
going
over
and
over
the
lesson
with
the
confused
boy
until
the
hard
parts
were
made
easy
finally
when
he
saw
that
rob
had
mastered
it
edgar
walked
out
into
the
yard
for
the
few
minutes
left
of
recess
the
boys
were
all
drawn
up
in
a
group
a
little
way
from
the
house
and
were
being
harangued
by
his
rival
nat
howard
his
chums
rob
stanard
dick
ambler
and
jack
preston
were
standing
together
a
few
feet
apart
from
the
rest
their
faces
were
very
red
and
the
haranguing
seemed
to
be
addressed
directly
to
them
edgar
stopped
where
he
was
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
but
shy
of
joining
a
crowd
over
which
nat
was
presiding
the
speaker
voice
rose
to
a
higher
key
i
tell
you
boys
he
was
saying
if
you
persist
in
intimacy
with
this
fellow
you
need
expect
to
be
in
with
me
and
my
crowd
we
do
want
you
and
your
crowd
was
the
response
he
worth
all
of
you
rolled
into
one
edgar
heart
stood
still
was
nat
howard
talking
about
the
voice
went
on
i
grant
you
the
fellow
smart
enough
and
game
enough
but
he
not
in
our
class
and
i
for
one
wo
associate
with
him
intimately
his
family
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
honorable
in
the
country
said
robert
stanard
i
heard
my
father
say
so
yes
but
his
father
must
have
been
a
black
sheep
to
run
away
with
a
common
actress
the
harangue
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
the
enraged
edgar
had
sprung
forward
and
with
a
blow
in
the
face
struck
nat
howard
down
friends
were
lifting
him
up
and
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
and
dusting
his
clothing
while
edgar
own
friends
gathered
around
him
as
if
to
restrain
him
from
repeating
the
attack
he
shook
them
off
gazing
with
contempt
upon
his
limp
and
adversary
i
not
hit
him
again
until
he
repeats
his
offence
he
assured
the
boys
but
i
want
him
and
all
other
cowardly
dogs
to
know
what
waiting
for
them
when
they
insult
the
memory
of
my
father
and
mother
yes
my
mother
was
an
actress
god
gave
her
the
gifts
to
make
her
one
and
she
had
the
pluck
to
use
them
to
earn
bread
for
herself
and
for
her
children
yes
she
was
an
actress
she
had
the
lovely
face
and
form
the
high
intelligence
and
the
poetic
soul
for
the
making
of
a
perfect
woman
or
for
the
interpreter
of
genius
for
the
personification
of
a
juliet
a
rosalind
or
a
cordelia
yes
she
was
an
actress
and
i
proud
of
it
as
surely
as
i
proud
she
an
angel
in
heaven
and
i
proud
that
my
father
the
son
of
a
proud
family
had
the
spirit
for
her
sweet
sake
to
fly
in
the
face
of
convention
to
count
family
fortune
and
all
well
lost
to
become
her
husband
and
to
adopt
her
profession
to
learn
of
her
in
order
that
he
might
be
always
at
her
side
to
protect
her
and
to
live
in
the
light
of
her
presence
if
i
had
choice
of
all
the
surnames
and
of
all
the
lineage
in
the
world
i
would
still
choose
the
name
of
poe
and
to
be
the
son
of
david
and
elizabeth
poe
players
the
boys
were
silent
the
school
bell
was
ringing
and
edgar
poe
still
pale
and
trembling
with
passion
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
with
head
up
in
the
direction
of
the
door
rob
stanard
and
rob
sully
walked
one
on
each
side
of
him
while
dick
ambler
and
jack
preston
and
several
others
among
his
adherents
followed
close
a
little
way
behind
the
group
came
the
other
boys
their
still
leader
in
their
midst
good
burke
who
had
succeeded
clarke
as
guessed
as
they
came
in
and
took
their
seats
that
there
had
been
an
altercation
of
some
kind
and
that
his
two
brag
scholars
had
been
prominent
in
it
but
he
was
wise
in
his
generation
and
allowed
the
boys
to
settle
their
own
differences
without
asking
any
questions
unless
he
were
appealed
to
when
his
sympathy
and
interest
were
found
to
be
theirs
to
count
upon
the
afternoon
session
was
unsatisfactory
but
the
master
was
in
an
indulgent
mood
and
apparently
did
not
notice
what
each
boy
felt
a
confusion
and
abstraction
there
was
a
palpable
sense
of
relief
when
the
closing
hour
came
at
dinner
that
day
edgar
was
silent
and
evidently
under
a
cloud
and
scarcely
touched
his
food
frances
allan
looked
toward
him
anxiously
and
her
husband
suspiciously
when
his
lack
of
appetite
was
remarked
upon
he
truthfully
enough
pleaded
headache
allan
was
all
sympathy
at
once
you
study
too
hard
dear
she
said
you
may
have
a
holiday
tomorrow
if
you
like
and
go
and
spend
the
day
in
the
country
with
rosalie
and
the
mackenzies
no
no
replied
the
boy
i
just
stay
quiet
in
my
room
this
evening
i
be
all
right
by
tomorrow
what
have
you
been
eating
demanded
john
allan
gruffly
nothing
since
breakfast
sir
was
the
reply
headaches
are
for
nervous
women
when
a
healthy
boy
complains
of
one
and
declines
dinner
it
generally
means
that
he
has
been
robbing
somebody
strawberry
patch
or
up
a
stuffing
fruit
he
said
in
the
acid
suspicious
tone
that
the
boy
knew
it
was
beyond
john
allan
powers
to
imagine
any
but
physical
causes
for
a
boy
ailments
not
until
the
door
of
his
own
little
was
closed
behind
him
did
edgar
poe
even
try
to
collect
his
thoughts
then
he
sat
down
at
his
window
and
looked
out
over
the
fragrant
garden
to
the
quiet
sky
contemplation
of
which
had
so
often
soothed
his
spirit
and
tried
to
readjust
the
inner
world
he
lived
in
in
accordance
with
the
discovery
he
had
just
made
a
first
such
readjustment
his
world
had
experienced
three
years
before
when
allan
had
taunted
him
with
his
dependence
upon
charity
before
that
time
the
world
as
he
knew
it
had
held
only
love
and
beauty
sorrow
as
he
had
seen
it
being
but
a
solemn
and
poetic
form
of
beauty
the
change
in
such
a
world
made
by
the
discovery
that
his
being
an
adopted
son
set
him
apart
in
a
class
different
from
other
boys
a
class
unlovely
and
loveless
had
been
great
had
stolen
much
of
the
joy
from
living
but
he
was
very
young
then
and
the
joy
of
mere
living
and
breathing
was
strong
in
his
blood
and
he
had
gradually
become
accustomed
hardened
if
you
will
to
the
idea
of
his
dependence
upon
charity
but
here
was
a
change
far
more
terrible
and
coming
at
a
time
when
he
was
old
enough
to
feel
it
far
more
keenly
he
was
indeed
in
a
class
by
himself
he
was
held
in
contempt
because
of
what
his
angel
mother
had
been
his
holy
of
holies
had
been
profaned
the
sacred
fire
that
warmed
his
inner
life
had
been
spat
upon
it
seemed
he
had
been
from
the
beginning
despised
though
he
had
not
dreamed
it
for
that
which
he
held
most
dear
of
which
he
was
most
proud
the
little
aristocratic
world
he
lived
in
would
doubtless
always
despise
him
but
that
was
because
of
its
narrowness
and
ignorance
for
which
he
in
turn
would
despise
it
with
the
whimsical
he
had
always
had
that
the
dead
remain
conscious
through
their
long
sleep
he
wondered
if
his
beautiful
young
mother
with
the
roses
on
her
hair
down
under
the
green
earth
was
not
aware
of
the
love
and
loyalty
of
her
boy
and
if
her
spirit
soaring
the
highest
heavens
would
not
aid
him
in
carrying
out
the
resolution
which
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
he
then
and
there
made
the
resolution
to
bring
this
mean
little
puffed
up
world
to
do
honor
to
his
name
to
her
name
of
which
he
was
prouder
in
this
hour
when
others
would
trample
it
in
the
dust
than
he
had
ever
been
before
young
boy
though
he
was
he
was
conscious
of
his
endowments
he
felt
that
the
divine
fire
of
poetic
feeling
in
his
breast
was
an
immortal
thing
up
to
this
time
his
singing
had
been
as
the
singing
of
a
an
impulse
a
necessity
to
express
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
his
heart
he
had
never
looked
far
enough
ahead
to
consider
whether
he
should
or
should
not
publish
his
work
but
now
ambition
awoke
at
its
birth
and
set
him
afire
from
those
parents
whose
memory
had
been
insulted
he
had
received
god
willing
it
the
precious
heritage
of
brilliant
intellect
he
would
put
the
work
of
this
intellect
his
stories
and
his
poems
into
books
he
would
give
them
to
the
wide
world
he
would
win
recognition
for
the
name
of
poe
he
drew
from
within
his
coat
the
miniature
of
his
mother
her
dying
gift
he
gazed
upon
it
long
and
tenderly
and
with
it
still
exposed
to
view
brought
from
his
desk
the
little
packet
of
yellowed
letters
in
their
faded
blue
ribbon
he
knew
them
by
heart
but
he
read
them
each
one
over
again
as
carefully
as
if
it
had
been
the
first
time
they
were
not
many
and
those
not
long
but
ah
they
were
sweet
those
tender
quaint
that
had
passed
between
his
parents
in
their
brief
courtship
and
married
life
his
father
so
manly
so
strong
like
the
letters
of
a
soldier
his
mother
so
modest
so
tender
they
did
not
stir
his
pulses
so
wildly
now
as
they
did
upon
his
first
reading
of
them
when
a
little
lad
at
old
but
they
were
no
less
beautiful
to
him
now
than
then
the
sentences
made
him
think
of
the
dainty
sweet
aroma
of
pressed
roses
he
tied
the
packet
up
again
and
kissed
letters
and
picture
as
if
to
seal
the
promise
he
was
making
them
then
restored
them
to
their
with
the
bitter
knowledge
that
had
come
to
him
he
felt
that
years
had
passed
over
him
that
he
would
never
be
young
again
this
boy
of
fourteen
he
raised
his
deep
pensive
eyes
once
more
to
the
quiet
sky
and
his
spirit
cried
to
heaven
to
grant
him
power
to
accomplish
this
task
he
had
set
himself
to
lift
the
loved
name
of
his
parents
from
the
dust
where
it
lay
and
to
set
it
high
in
the
temple
of
fame
wreathed
with
immortal
myrtle
his
resolution
gave
to
his
poetic
face
and
his
slender
figure
an
air
of
mastery
as
though
some
new
high
quality
had
been
born
within
him
chapter
viii
in
the
days
that
followed
edgar
friends
found
him
unusually
silent
yet
not
morose
serenity
sat
on
his
broad
thoughtful
brow
and
in
his
great
soft
eyes
nat
howard
and
his
chums
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
and
wore
in
his
presence
the
air
of
offended
dignity
which
the
are
apt
to
assume
when
conscious
of
being
in
the
wrong
or
of
having
committed
an
injury
which
the
victim
has
received
with
credit
and
the
offender
has
not
forgiven
it
is
so
much
easier
to
grant
pardon
for
an
injury
received
than
for
one
given
edgar
own
friends
were
more
emphatic
in
their
devotion
to
him
than
ever
racking
their
young
brains
for
ways
in
which
to
show
their
loyalty
and
frequently
looking
into
his
face
with
the
expression
of
soft
adoration
and
trust
one
sees
in
the
eyes
of
a
faithful
dog
edgar
was
touched
and
gratified
and
his
sweet
spontaneous
smile
often
rewarded
their
efforts
but
his
face
would
soon
become
grave
again
and
the
boys
were
aware
that
the
mind
of
their
gifted
friend
was
busy
with
thoughts
in
which
they
had
no
part
this
gave
them
an
impression
of
distance
between
them
and
him
he
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
to
have
become
remote
as
though
a
chasm
by
what
power
they
knew
not
had
opened
between
them
making
their
love
for
him
as
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
they
knew
that
he
was
more
often
than
ever
before
working
upon
his
poetical
and
other
compositions
but
these
were
seldom
shown
or
even
mentioned
to
them
each
boy
in
his
own
way
sought
to
bridge
the
gulf
that
separated
them
from
their
idol
robert
sully
missed
his
latin
lesson
on
purpose
in
the
hope
that
eddie
would
stay
in
and
help
him
and
eddie
did
but
wore
that
same
detached
air
in
which
there
was
no
intimacy
or
comfort
when
the
lesson
was
learned
edgar
took
a
slate
from
the
desk
before
them
rubbed
off
the
problem
that
was
upon
it
and
quickly
wrote
down
a
little
poem
of
several
stanzas
he
held
it
out
with
a
smile
to
rob
telling
him
that
while
teaching
him
his
lesson
he
had
been
practicing
dividing
his
mind
and
that
while
one
part
of
his
brain
had
been
putting
english
into
latin
the
other
part
had
composed
the
verses
on
the
slate
the
dumfounded
rob
read
the
verses
aloud
but
before
he
could
express
his
amazement
edgar
had
taken
the
slate
from
him
and
with
one
swipe
of
the
damp
spunge
obliterated
the
rhymes
write
them
on
paper
for
me
please
plead
robert
the
brilliant
smile
of
the
flashed
upon
him
oh
they
were
not
worth
keeping
said
he
indifferently
they
were
merely
an
exercise
and
picking
up
his
books
and
hat
he
walked
out
of
the
door
whistling
in
clear
high
plaintive
notes
one
of
the
melodies
of
his
favorite
tom
moore
the
boy
left
behind
looked
after
him
with
a
troubled
heart
and
misty
eyes
this
wonderful
friend
of
his
was
as
kind
as
ever
yet
he
seemed
changed
it
was
clear
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
will
you
go
swimming
with
me
this
evening
eddie
said
dick
ambler
one
day
when
school
was
out
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
was
the
hearty
response
dick
went
home
to
his
dinner
with
a
singing
heart
if
anything
could
bring
edgar
down
from
the
clouds
to
his
own
level
surely
it
would
be
bathing
together
he
certainly
could
not
make
poetry
while
diving
and
swimming
naked
in
the
racing
and
tumbling
falls
of
james
river
a
merry
battle
with
those
energetic
waters
kept
a
fellow
wits
as
well
as
his
muscles
fully
occupied
but
even
this
attempt
was
a
failure
if
edgar
made
any
poetry
while
in
the
water
he
did
not
mention
it
but
he
was
and
unsociable
all
the
way
to
the
river
and
back
for
curious
listening
for
and
hunting
and
talking
almost
none
at
all
in
the
water
he
seemed
to
wake
up
and
never
dived
with
more
grace
or
daring
but
no
sooner
had
they
started
on
the
way
home
than
he
was
off
with
his
dreams
again
rob
stanard
was
more
successful
in
his
attempts
to
interest
his
friend
in
spite
of
their
intimacy
at
school
and
on
the
playground
edgar
had
up
to
this
time
never
visited
the
stanard
home
rob
had
enlisted
his
mother
sympathy
in
the
orphan
boy
and
she
had
suggested
that
he
should
invite
edgar
home
with
him
some
day
it
now
occurred
to
rob
that
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
do
so
and
knowing
his
friend
fondness
for
dumb
animals
he
offered
his
pets
as
an
attraction
asking
him
to
come
and
see
his
pigeons
and
rabbits
his
invitation
was
accepted
with
alacrity
edgar
had
seen
rob
mother
but
only
at
a
distance
he
knew
her
reputation
as
one
of
the
town
beauties
but
lovely
women
were
not
rare
in
richmond
and
though
he
was
he
had
never
had
any
especial
curiosity
in
regard
to
stanard
he
was
altogether
unprepared
for
the
vision
that
broke
upon
him
instead
of
going
through
the
house
rob
had
piloted
him
by
way
of
a
side
gate
directly
into
the
walled
garden
sweet
and
gay
with
roses
lilies
and
other
flowers
of
early
june
stanard
who
took
almost
as
much
pleasure
in
her
children
pets
as
they
did
was
standing
near
a
clump
of
holding
in
her
hands
a
plate
from
which
the
pigeons
were
feeding
she
was
at
this
time
though
the
mother
of
edgar
chum
not
thirty
years
of
age
and
her
pensive
beauty
was
in
its
fullest
flower
against
the
sombre
background
the
made
her
slight
figure
clad
in
soft
clinging
white
seemed
airy
and
sylphlike
her
dark
curling
hair
girlishly
bound
with
a
ribbon
snood
and
her
large
brown
eyes
were
in
striking
contrast
to
her
complexion
which
was
pale
with
the
radiant
and
warm
palor
of
a
or
a
pearl
her
features
were
daintily
modelled
and
like
slender
lilies
were
the
hands
holding
the
deep
blue
plate
from
which
the
pigeons
white
grey
and
bronze
fed
fluttering
about
her
with
soft
cooings
the
picture
was
so
much
more
like
a
poet
dream
than
a
reality
that
the
stepped
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
it
is
only
my
mother
explained
rob
she
be
glad
to
see
you
the
next
moment
she
had
perceived
the
boys
and
with
quick
impulse
set
the
plate
upon
the
ground
and
came
forward
and
before
a
word
of
introduction
could
be
spoken
had
taken
the
visitor
hand
between
both
her
own
fair
palms
holding
it
thus
with
gentle
gracious
pressure
in
a
pretty
cordial
way
she
had
while
she
greeted
him
the
soft
eyes
that
rested
on
his
face
filled
with
kindness
and
welcome
so
this
is
my
rob
friend
she
was
saying
in
a
low
musical
voice
rob
mother
is
delighted
to
see
you
for
his
sake
and
for
your
own
too
edgar
for
i
greatly
admired
gifted
mother
i
saw
her
once
only
when
i
was
a
young
girl
but
i
can
never
forget
her
lovely
face
and
sweet
plaintive
voice
it
was
one
of
the
last
times
she
ever
acted
and
she
was
ill
and
pale
but
she
was
exquisitely
beautiful
and
made
the
most
charming
juliet
she
interested
me
more
than
any
actress
i
have
ever
seen
edgar
poe
longed
to
fall
down
and
kiss
her
feet
to
worship
her
her
beauty
her
gentleness
and
her
gracious
words
so
stirred
his
soul
that
he
grew
faint
power
of
speech
almost
left
him
and
vastly
to
his
humiliation
he
could
with
difficulty
control
his
voice
to
utter
a
few
stumbling
words
of
thanks
he
who
was
usually
so
ready
of
speech
if
she
noticed
his
confusion
she
did
not
appear
to
do
so
her
heart
had
been
touched
by
all
she
had
heard
from
her
son
of
the
lonely
boy
and
she
had
also
been
interested
in
accounts
of
his
gifts
that
had
come
to
her
from
various
sources
the
beauty
the
poetry
the
pensiveness
of
his
face
moved
her
deeply
knowing
his
history
and
divining
the
lack
of
sympathy
one
of
his
bent
would
probably
find
in
the
allan
home
for
all
its
indulgences
she
sat
on
a
and
talked
to
him
for
a
time
in
her
gentle
understanding
way
and
then
not
wishing
to
be
a
restraint
upon
the
boys
after
placing
her
husband
fine
library
at
edgar
disposal
and
urging
him
to
come
often
to
see
rob
withdrew
into
the
house
the
motherless
boy
looked
after
her
until
she
had
disappeared
and
stared
at
the
door
that
had
closed
upon
her
until
he
was
recalled
from
his
reverie
by
the
voice
of
his
friend
suggesting
that
they
now
see
the
rabbits
edgar
looked
at
the
gentle
creatures
with
unseeing
eyes
though
he
appeared
to
be
listening
to
the
prattle
of
his
companion
concerning
them
suddenly
in
a
voice
filled
with
enthusiasm
and
with
a
touch
of
awe
in
it
he
said
rob
your
mother
is
divinely
beautiful
and
bully
was
the
nonchalant
reply
the
best
thing
about
her
is
the
way
she
takes
up
for
a
fellow
when
he
brings
in
a
bad
report
or
gets
into
a
scrape
fathers
always
think
it
their
sons
fault
you
know
edgar
flushed
he
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
the
adjective
applied
to
her
seemed
blasphemy
aloud
he
said
she
an
angel
she
the
one
i
always
dreamed
about
you
dreamed
about
mother
when
you
had
never
seen
her
questioned
the
astonished
rob
what
did
you
dream
nothing
in
the
way
you
mean
i
meant
she
is
like
my
idea
of
a
perfect
woman
the
kind
of
woman
a
man
could
always
be
good
for
or
would
gladly
die
to
serve
well
i
not
smart
enough
to
think
out
things
like
that
eddie
but
mother
certainly
is
all
right
what
you
say
about
her
sounds
nice
and
she
understand
it
too
i
just
bet
that
you
and
mother
be
the
best
sort
of
cronies
when
you
know
each
other
better
she
likes
all
those
queer
old
books
you
think
so
fine
and
she
knows
whole
pages
of
poetry
by
heart
when
you
and
she
get
together
it
will
be
like
two
books
talking
out
loud
to
each
other
i
wo
be
able
to
join
in
much
but
it
will
be
as
good
as
a
play
to
listen
the
young
poet
bent
his
steps
homeward
with
but
one
thought
one
hope
in
his
heart
and
that
a
consuming
one
to
look
again
upon
the
lovely
face
to
hear
again
the
voice
that
had
enthralled
him
had
taken
his
heart
by
storm
and
filled
it
with
a
veritable
the
rapturous
devotion
of
the
virgin
heart
of
an
ardent
and
romantic
youth
first
love
yet
so
much
more
than
ordinary
love
a
pure
passion
of
the
soul
in
which
there
was
much
of
worship
and
nothing
of
desire
surely
the
most
pure
and
holy
passion
the
world
has
ever
known
for
in
it
there
was
absolutely
nothing
of
self
like
dante
after
his
first
meeting
with
beatrice
this
virginia
had
entered
upon
a
a
new
life
made
all
of
beauty
what
difference
did
the
taunts
of
schoolmates
the
hardness
of
a
make
now
the
wounds
they
made
had
been
gratefully
healed
by
the
balm
of
her
beauteous
words
about
his
mother
those
old
wounds
were
as
nothing
neither
they
nor
anything
else
had
power
to
harm
him
now
in
the
new
life
that
had
opened
so
suddenly
before
him
he
would
bear
a
charmed
existence
he
went
to
his
room
before
the
usual
hour
that
night
for
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
dreams
with
his
newest
most
beautiful
dream
to
his
room
but
not
to
bed
life
was
too
beautiful
to
be
wasted
in
sleep
he
lighted
his
lamp
and
holding
his
mother
picture
within
its
circle
of
light
gazed
long
and
devotedly
upon
it
did
she
know
of
the
great
light
that
had
shone
out
of
what
seemed
a
sunless
sky
upon
her
boy
had
she
looking
out
from
high
heaven
seen
the
gracious
greeting
of
the
beautiful
being
who
was
madonna
and
psyche
in
one
had
she
heard
her
own
cause
so
sweetly
championed
her
own
name
so
sweetly
cleared
of
opprobrium
he
threw
himself
upon
his
lounge
and
lay
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
curly
head
still
dreaming
dreaming
dreaming
until
were
merged
into
real
dreams
for
he
was
fast
asleep
in
his
sleep
he
saw
the
lady
of
his
dreams
in
a
situation
of
peril
from
which
he
joyfully
rescued
her
he
awoke
with
a
start
his
lamp
had
burned
itself
out
but
a
late
moon
flooded
the
room
with
the
white
light
that
he
loved
a
breeze
laden
with
odors
caught
from
the
many
and
the
magnolias
now
in
full
bloom
it
had
come
across
stirred
the
curtain
his
nostrils
always
sensitive
to
the
odors
of
flowers
drank
it
in
rapturously
so
it
was
his
senses
swam
he
arose
and
looked
out
upon
the
blossoms
like
phantoms
under
the
moon
a
clock
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
was
striking
twelve
how
much
more
beautiful
was
the
world
now
at
high
noon
than
at
the
same
hour
of
the
day
all
the
house
save
himself
was
asleep
how
easy
it
would
be
to
escape
into
this
lovely
night
to
walk
through
this
ambrosial
air
to
the
in
which
doubtless
lay
like
a
closed
clasped
in
sleep
a
the
southland
nightingale
in
some
tree
or
bush
not
far
away
burst
into
melody
that
seemed
to
voice
as
no
words
could
his
own
emotion
down
the
stair
he
slipped
and
out
of
the
door
into
the
intoxicating
beauty
of
the
southern
summer
night
indeed
the
odors
of
the
flowers
the
moonlight
the
together
with
his
remembrance
of
his
lady
greeting
went
to
his
head
like
wine
as
he
strolled
along
some
lines
of
shelley
which
had
long
been
favorites
of
his
sang
in
his
brain
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
in
the
first
sweet
sleep
of
night
when
the
winds
are
breathing
low
and
the
stars
are
shining
bright
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
and
the
spirit
in
my
feet
has
led
me
who
knows
how
to
thy
sweet
the
wandering
airs
they
faint
on
the
dark
the
silent
stream
the
champak
odors
fail
like
sweet
thoughts
in
a
dream
the
nightingale
complaint
it
dies
upon
her
heart
as
i
must
die
on
thine
oh
beloved
as
thou
art
oh
lift
me
from
the
grass
i
die
i
faint
i
fail
let
thy
love
in
kisses
rain
on
my
lips
and
eyelids
pale
my
cheek
is
cold
and
white
alas
my
heart
beats
loud
and
fast
oh
press
it
close
to
thine
again
where
it
will
break
at
last
the
words
of
the
latter
half
of
this
serenade
were
meaningless
as
applied
to
his
case
to
have
quoted
them
even
mentally
in
any
literal
sense
would
have
seemed
to
him
profanation
yet
the
whole
poem
in
some
way
not
to
be
analysed
or
defined
expressed
his
mood
and
who
so
brutal
as
to
seek
to
reduce
to
the
emotions
of
a
in
the
springtime
of
life
at
length
he
was
before
the
closed
and
shuttered
house
standing
silent
and
asleep
opposite
were
the
grassy
slopes
of
capitol
square
with
the
pillared
white
capitol
in
its
midst
looking
in
the
moonlight
like
a
dream
of
old
greece
house
he
looked
upon
its
moonlit
ivied
walls
with
adoration
a
light
still
shone
from
one
upper
room
was
it
chamber
was
she
too
awake
and
alive
to
the
beauty
of
this
magic
night
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
at
the
thought
then
oh
wonder
his
knees
trembled
under
him
he
grew
dizzy
and
was
ready
indeed
to
cry
i
die
i
faint
i
fail
she
crossed
the
square
of
light
the
window
made
in
her
uplifted
hand
she
carried
the
lamp
from
which
the
light
shone
and
for
a
moment
her
slight
figure
clad
all
in
white
as
he
had
seen
her
in
the
garden
a
few
hours
before
and
softly
illuminated
was
framed
in
the
casement
but
for
a
moment
then
disappeared
but
the
trembling
and
poet
seemed
to
see
it
still
and
gazed
and
gazed
until
the
light
was
out
and
all
the
house
dark
he
stumbled
back
through
the
moonlight
to
his
home
he
crept
up
the
creaking
stair
again
to
his
little
room
but
sleep
was
now
more
than
ever
impossible
though
the
lamp
had
gone
out
a
candle
stood
upon
a
stand
at
the
head
of
his
bed
he
lighted
it
and
by
its
ray
wrote
under
the
spell
of
the
hour
the
first
utterance
in
which
he
edgar
poe
ascended
from
the
plane
of
a
maker
of
promising
verse
to
the
realm
of
the
true
poet
a
poem
to
the
lady
of
his
heart
dream
destined
though
he
little
guessed
it
to
make
her
name
immortal
and
to
send
the
fame
of
his
youthful
passion
down
the
ages
as
one
of
the
world
historic
what
was
her
name
he
wondered
he
had
never
heard
it
but
he
would
call
her
helen
the
ancient
synonym
of
womanly
beauty
but
the
loveliest
helen
he
believed
that
ever
set
piping
her
praise
and
so
to
helen
were
the
words
he
wrote
at
the
top
of
his
page
and
underneath
the
name
these
lines
helen
thy
beauty
is
to
me
like
those
nicean
barks
of
yore
that
gently
a
perfumed
sea
the
weary
wayworn
wanderer
bore
to
his
own
native
shore
on
desperate
seas
long
wont
to
roam
thy
hyacinth
hair
thy
classic
face
thy
naiad
airs
have
brought
me
home
to
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
lo
in
yon
brilliant
how
i
see
thee
stand
the
agate
lamp
within
thy
hand
ah
psyche
from
the
regions
which
are
holy
land
chapter
ix
with
his
meeting
with
helen
a
new
life
indeed
seemed
to
have
opened
for
edgar
the
dreamer
not
only
had
her
own
interest
and
sympathy
been
aroused
but
her
husband
a
learned
and
accomplished
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
also
received
him
cordially
and
became
deeply
interested
in
him
and
he
found
in
their
home
what
his
own
had
lacked
for
him
a
thoroughly
congenial
atmosphere
helen
stanard
listened
kindly
to
his
boyish
rhapsodies
about
his
favorite
poets
and
encouraged
him
to
bring
her
his
own
portefolio
of
verses
which
he
did
all
but
the
ones
addressed
to
herself
these
he
kept
secret
she
read
all
he
brought
her
carefully
and
intelligently
criticised
them
in
a
way
that
was
a
real
help
to
him
as
has
been
said
when
allan
had
discovered
that
his
adopted
son
was
a
rhymster
he
had
rebuked
him
severely
for
such
idle
waste
of
time
and
in
a
vain
attempt
to
clip
the
wings
of
pegasus
threatened
him
with
punishment
if
he
should
hear
of
such
folly
again
allan
on
the
contrary
though
she
was
not
a
bookish
woman
had
protested
against
her
husband
command
urging
that
edgar
be
encouraged
to
cultivate
his
talent
the
ability
to
compose
verse
seemed
to
her
in
a
boy
of
age
little
short
of
miraculous
and
proud
of
her
pet
accomplishment
she
heaped
indiscriminate
praise
upon
every
line
that
she
saw
of
his
writing
the
boy
hardly
knowing
which
way
to
escape
between
these
two
fires
that
bade
fair
to
work
the
ruin
of
his
gift
turned
eagerly
to
his
new
friend
helen
gently
told
him
that
she
believed
his
talent
to
be
a
sacred
trust
and
that
he
would
be
committing
sin
to
bury
it
even
though
by
so
doing
he
should
be
fulfilling
the
wishes
of
his
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
he
must
however
not
forget
his
duty
to
allan
in
regard
to
this
matter
as
in
other
things
but
treat
his
views
with
all
the
consideration
possible
above
all
things
he
was
never
to
depart
from
the
truth
in
talking
to
him
but
to
tell
him
in
a
straightforward
and
respectful
way
that
he
believed
it
his
duty
when
poetical
thoughts
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
to
set
them
down
and
even
to
encourage
and
invite
such
thoughts
at
the
same
time
she
earnestly
warned
him
against
being
overmuch
impressed
by
the
flattering
estimates
of
his
work
of
his
friends
especially
of
his
mother
who
was
far
too
partial
to
him
personally
to
be
a
safe
judge
of
his
writings
a
happier
summer
than
is
often
given
mortals
to
know
edgar
the
dreamer
passed
at
the
feet
of
the
lovely
young
matron
who
had
become
a
sort
of
to
him
happiness
which
with
a
touch
of
the
superstition
that
was
characteristic
of
him
he
often
told
himself
was
too
perfect
to
last
what
was
it
that
made
him
feel
sometimes
in
looking
upon
her
under
the
serene
sky
of
that
ideal
summer
that
a
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
threw
its
shadow
upon
her
was
it
that
faint
hint
of
sadness
in
her
dark
eyes
or
the
ethereal
radiance
of
her
pale
complexion
that
while
thrilling
him
with
delight
in
the
exquisite
quality
of
her
beauty
filled
him
with
foreboding
ere
the
frosts
of
autumn
had
robbed
her
garden
of
its
glory
blighting
sorrow
had
fallen
upon
her
tender
in
the
death
of
a
darling
baby
girl
beneath
this
blow
the
health
of
sweet
helen
always
frail
succumbed
and
her
home
became
thenceforth
as
a
living
tomb
in
which
the
few
who
ever
saw
her
again
trod
softly
and
spoke
in
hushed
voices
when
the
earliest
roses
were
in
bloom
in
her
garden
two
years
after
edgar
poe
first
saw
her
there
she
lay
in
her
coffin
and
for
him
the
world
seemed
to
have
come
to
an
end
she
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
new
cemetery
on
shockoe
hill
not
far
from
the
allan
home
the
bier
was
followed
by
its
black
procession
of
mourners
and
no
one
knew
that
the
heart
of
a
youth
who
followed
too
but
at
a
distance
was
breaking
though
husband
and
children
and
brother
and
sister
were
bowed
with
grief
he
told
himself
that
there
was
among
them
no
sorrow
like
unto
his
sorrow
who
had
not
even
the
right
of
kinship
to
mourn
for
her
of
what
business
of
his
he
fancied
out
of
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
the
world
saying
of
what
business
of
his
was
her
death
what
business
had
he
to
mourn
again
his
feet
kept
time
to
the
old
refrain
of
never
nevermore
that
hammered
in
his
brain
a
refrain
that
to
the
unrealizing
ear
of
the
child
of
three
had
been
sad
with
a
beautiful
rhythmic
sadness
that
was
rather
pleasurable
than
otherwise
that
to
the
youth
of
sixteen
was
still
musical
and
beautiful
though
filled
with
despair
as
at
many
another
time
his
poetical
gift
gave
him
a
merciful
vent
for
his
pent
up
feeling
so
now
it
came
to
his
aid
and
upon
the
night
of
the
day
when
she
was
laid
to
rest
he
poured
out
his
sorrow
in
the
paean
which
he
was
afterwards
to
revise
and
rename
lenore
an
anthem
for
the
queenliest
dead
that
ever
died
so
young
a
dirge
for
her
the
doubly
dead
in
that
she
died
so
young
as
during
his
childhood
and
afterwards
he
had
found
a
mournful
pleasure
in
visiting
the
grave
of
his
mother
in
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
so
now
he
found
a
blessed
solace
in
his
terrible
loneliness
in
pilgrimages
to
the
shrine
for
as
such
he
held
the
grave
of
his
saint
in
the
new
cemetery
these
pilgrimages
he
usually
made
at
night
his
grief
was
too
sacred
a
thing
to
be
flaunted
in
broad
daylight
many
a
night
during
the
spring
and
summer
found
him
slipping
down
the
stair
when
the
house
was
asleep
and
taking
his
way
through
the
silent
city
of
slumber
to
that
even
more
silent
city
of
death
oh
that
those
that
lay
there
not
much
more
still
than
they
who
lay
asleep
in
their
beds
in
that
other
city
might
arise
like
them
with
the
morrow
sun
often
as
he
walked
along
drinking
in
the
perfumed
night
air
that
he
loved
the
night
breeze
gratefully
lifting
the
ringlets
from
his
fevered
brow
often
he
thought
of
that
first
summer
night
when
with
the
sweet
words
of
shelley
serenade
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
singing
themselves
in
his
heart
he
had
gone
with
light
feet
to
worship
beneath
her
window
ah
the
world
was
young
then
for
sweet
hope
was
alive
the
iron
gates
of
the
cemetery
were
locked
but
the
wall
was
not
very
high
to
scale
it
but
added
zest
to
his
adventure
he
would
be
a
knight
unfit
for
his
vigil
if
he
were
to
let
himself
be
so
easily
balked
within
the
wall
the
odors
of
flowers
were
even
heavier
more
oppressively
sweet
than
without
and
the
silence
surpassed
the
silence
of
the
outer
city
even
as
the
stillness
of
the
sleepers
here
surpassed
the
stillness
of
those
yonder
he
listened
and
listened
to
the
silence
surely
if
she
should
speak
even
from
down
under
the
ground
he
could
hear
her
across
this
silence
which
was
as
a
void
a
black
and
terrible
void
his
first
pilgrimages
were
by
moonlight
but
when
the
moonless
nights
came
he
continued
his
vigils
he
would
have
known
the
way
by
that
time
with
his
eyes
shut
sometimes
he
was
afraid
horribly
afraid
he
seemed
in
the
shadows
to
descry
weird
moving
stealthily
in
the
silence
to
hear
ghostly
whispers
sometimes
he
fancied
he
heard
silence
but
in
the
very
fear
that
clutched
his
throat
there
was
a
fascination
a
lure
that
made
it
impossible
to
turn
back
his
sorrow
was
exquisite
his
terror
was
exquisite
his
loneliness
was
oh
how
exquisite
yet
in
courting
them
all
here
in
the
dead
of
night
prone
on
her
grave
he
found
the
only
balm
he
knew
the
only
sympathy
for
to
his
fancy
the
dark
and
the
quiet
had
always
seemed
sentient
things
and
he
felt
that
they
gave
him
a
sympathy
he
did
not
could
not
ask
of
people
a
breathless
night
in
july
found
him
at
the
familiar
tryst
at
an
earlier
hour
than
was
his
wont
he
lay
upon
the
grass
at
her
feet
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
and
his
face
turned
up
to
the
stars
there
was
moonlight
as
well
as
starlight
and
in
its
silvery
radiance
his
features
always
pale
had
the
frigid
whiteness
of
marble
the
eyes
that
stared
upward
to
the
stars
were
larger
darker
than
in
daylight
and
more
full
of
brooding
the
white
brow
with
its
crown
of
dark
ringlets
was
whiter
and
more
expansive
in
a
cottage
overlooking
a
rose
garden
on
clay
street
an
erect
gentleman
in
an
uncompromising
stock
and
immaculate
ruffles
with
narrow
blue
eyes
under
a
beetling
brow
and
a
somewhat
nose
sharply
questioned
a
fair
and
graceful
lady
with
an
anxious
expression
on
her
as
to
why
that
boy
did
not
come
home
to
his
supper
but
they
were
used
by
now
to
the
boy
strange
wayward
whims
and
so
did
not
marvel
much
only
they
had
not
seen
him
since
the
feat
that
had
set
the
town
ringing
with
his
name
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
would
have
been
natural
for
him
to
come
home
in
the
flush
of
his
triumph
and
tell
them
about
it
edgar
poe
had
that
day
created
the
sensation
of
the
hour
by
swimming
from
the
richmond
wharves
to
warwick
a
distance
of
six
miles
in
the
midsummer
sun
richmond
was
a
fair
and
pleasant
little
city
in
those
days
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
our
found
in
it
so
much
to
make
him
melancholy
the
merriest
place
in
america
thackeray
called
it
some
years
later
and
would
probably
have
said
the
same
of
it
then
had
he
been
there
the
blight
of
civil
war
had
not
touched
the
cheerful
temper
of
its
people
the
tenement
row
had
not
crowded
out
grass
and
flowers
it
was
more
a
large
village
than
a
town
with
gracious
homes
not
elbowing
each
other
for
foundation
room
but
standing
comfortably
apart
amid
their
green
lawns
and
with
wide
verandahs
overhanging
their
gardens
after
tea
on
warm
nights
the
houses
overflowed
into
these
verandahs
and
there
was
much
visiting
from
one
to
another
much
talk
and
happy
laughter
the
popular
theme
being
whatever
happened
to
be
the
news
it
was
the
day
of
contentment
for
wants
were
moderate
and
plentifully
supplied
the
day
of
satisfaction
in
wholesome
domestic
joys
the
day
of
hospitality
without
grudging
the
day
when
sweetness
extracted
from
little
pleasures
did
not
need
spicing
for
palates
were
not
jaded
the
day
of
the
ideal
simple
life
upon
this
night
as
on
other
nights
young
girls
who
were
not
yet
gone
to
the
springs
floated
along
the
fashionable
promenades
in
airy
muslins
with
their
cavaliers
beside
them
groups
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
sat
on
the
porches
and
children
played
chased
or
sat
on
the
steps
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
their
elders
and
everywhere
in
all
of
the
groups
the
chief
topic
was
the
boy
edgar
poe
and
his
wonderful
swim
and
the
boy
who
had
in
an
afternoon
become
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
foremost
figure
in
town
knew
it
but
did
not
care
to
lie
alone
on
the
grass
by
the
grave
of
his
dead
divinity
and
gaze
at
the
far
stars
and
brood
upon
his
young
sorrows
this
gave
him
more
satisfaction
than
to
be
the
central
figure
of
any
one
of
the
groups
singing
his
praise
filled
him
with
a
romantic
despair
that
to
his
soul
had
a
more
delicately
sweet
flavor
than
positive
pleasure
as
to
the
erect
gentleman
in
the
high
stock
and
the
pretty
lady
with
the
tender
anxious
face
they
had
for
the
present
no
part
in
his
thoughts
it
was
wrong
and
ungrateful
of
him
that
they
should
not
have
and
if
he
had
remembered
them
he
would
have
known
that
it
was
wrong
and
ungrateful
but
he
would
not
have
cared
and
as
for
his
food
he
had
supped
royally
and
without
compunction
upon
the
fruit
of
an
inviting
orchard
to
which
he
had
helped
himself
unblushingly
upon
his
way
into
town
a
reckless
mood
born
of
the
restlessness
that
was
in
his
blood
was
upon
him
the
truth
was
that
poignant
as
was
his
pleasure
in
dwelling
upon
his
poetical
sorrow
for
the
adored
helen
his
lost
lenore
it
did
not
fully
satisfy
him
his
youthful
heart
was
hungry
for
response
to
his
sentiment
for
the
more
robust
diet
of
mutual
love
in
plain
english
edgar
poe
wanted
and
wanted
badly
a
sweetheart
though
he
did
not
suspect
it
when
finally
he
scaled
the
cemetery
wall
and
took
his
way
homeward
he
did
not
go
directly
to
the
cottage
where
the
erect
gentleman
and
the
pretty
lady
awaited
him
just
as
he
was
approaching
it
he
heard
elmira
royster
guitar
in
the
porch
opposite
and
he
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
royster
gate
the
roysters
and
allans
had
been
neighbors
for
years
and
he
and
elmira
had
been
brought
up
together
at
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
the
guitar
grew
suddenly
silent
and
a
slight
rather
colorless
girl
in
a
white
dress
with
a
white
flower
in
her
fluffy
blonde
hair
came
from
out
the
shadow
of
the
microphilla
rose
that
embowered
the
porch
and
stood
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
giving
him
greeting
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
eddie
she
said
all
of
the
family
but
me
have
gone
to
a
party
and
i
so
lonesome
besides
i
like
everybody
else
in
town
want
a
chance
to
congratulate
you
congratulate
he
replied
with
a
shrug
as
he
took
a
seat
beside
her
under
the
roses
congratulate
in
their
hearts
they
all
despise
me
then
with
a
smile
you
see
the
blue
devils
have
the
upper
hand
of
me
tonight
myra
well
they
are
fibbing
devils
if
they
tell
you
you
are
despised
dick
ambler
was
over
at
your
house
looking
for
you
a
little
while
ago
and
he
stopped
by
and
told
me
about
your
swim
he
said
he
and
the
other
boys
that
followed
you
in
the
boat
had
never
seen
anything
so
exciting
in
their
lives
they
were
expecting
you
to
give
out
any
minute
and
so
much
afraid
that
if
you
did
you
would
go
under
before
they
could
get
hold
of
you
when
you
won
the
wager
they
were
so
proud
and
happy
that
they
were
almost
beside
themselves
oh
i
know
dick
and
the
rest
are
the
best
and
truest
friends
a
fellow
ever
had
bless
their
hearts
but
they
are
the
exceptions
nonsense
there
not
a
boy
in
town
tonight
who
would
not
give
his
head
to
be
in
your
shoes
and
shyly
the
girls
are
all
wild
about
you
the
hero
smiled
indulgently
no
woman
was
ever
thrown
with
edgar
poe
from
his
birth
up
but
in
some
fashion
or
degree
loved
him
and
to
him
all
women
were
angels
he
never
as
boy
or
man
entertained
a
thought
or
wrote
a
line
of
one
of
them
that
was
not
reverent
he
admired
in
varying
degree
all
types
of
feminine
loveliness
but
myra
though
he
liked
her
was
not
the
style
that
he
most
cared
for
he
had
always
thought
her
too
washed
out
the
soul
that
shone
through
her
rather
prominent
eyes
was
too
transparent
too
easily
read
he
found
more
interesting
the
brunette
type
and
the
complex
nature
that
goes
with
it
the
flashes
of
starlight
the
softness
and
the
warmth
of
brown
eyes
the
mysteries
that
lie
in
the
shadow
of
dusky
lashes
the
variety
of
rich
warm
tones
in
chestnut
and
auburn
tresses
but
myra
was
a
revelation
to
him
tonight
he
had
never
dreamed
that
she
could
look
so
pretty
very
as
she
did
now
in
her
white
dress
with
the
moonlight
filtering
through
the
foliage
upon
her
fair
hair
and
her
face
turned
full
of
liking
and
undisguised
admiration
upon
him
and
her
lovely
arms
bared
to
the
elbow
she
had
an
ethereal
appearance
that
was
bewitching
and
in
his
despondent
mood
her
frank
praise
was
more
than
sweet
still
his
answer
was
as
bitter
as
ever
oh
well
what
does
it
all
amount
to
they
would
say
the
same
of
any
acrobat
in
a
circus
whose
joints
were
a
bit
more
limber
than
those
of
the
rest
of
his
tribe
that
does
not
remove
their
contempt
for
me
personally
i
do
feel
contempt
for
you
eddie
she
gently
replied
just
breathing
it
myra
was
really
wonderful
tonight
he
had
not
known
her
voice
could
have
so
much
color
in
it
and
the
white
flower
in
her
hair
a
its
excessively
sweet
fragrance
told
him
gave
her
pale
beauty
the
touch
of
romance
it
had
always
lacked
the
poetic
eyes
that
looked
into
hers
mellowed
the
cynical
voice
softened
do
you
myra
well
you
better
cultivate
it
its
the
fashion
and
it
the
only
feeling
i
worth
eddie
she
said
earnestly
tenderly
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
wo
talk
that
way
any
more
at
least
not
to
it
hurts
me
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
was
as
fair
as
a
petal
from
the
jessamine
flower
in
her
hair
he
took
it
gently
in
his
dear
little
myra
little
playmate
he
said
you
are
my
friend
i
know
and
have
been
since
we
were
mere
babies
in
spite
of
knowing
as
you
do
what
a
naughty
idle
disobedient
boy
i
been
deserving
every
flogging
and
scolding
i
gotten
and
utterly
unworthy
all
the
good
things
that
have
come
my
way
including
your
dear
friendship
you
are
breaking
your
promise
already
she
said
you
run
yourself
down
to
me
i
think
you
are
the
nicest
boy
in
town
there
was
nothing
complex
about
myra
her
mind
was
an
open
book
and
he
suddenly
found
he
liked
it
so
liked
it
tremendously
her
unveiled
avowal
of
preference
for
him
was
most
soothing
to
his
restless
dissatisfied
mood
thank
you
myra
he
said
tenderly
kissing
the
hand
before
he
laid
it
down
he
had
a
strong
impulse
to
kiss
but
resisted
it
with
an
effort
and
abruptly
changed
the
subject
did
you
know
that
we
are
going
to
move
he
asked
and
that
i
going
to
the
university
next
winter
she
questioned
aghast
where
to
the
gallego
mansion
at
fifth
and
main
streets
allan
has
bought
it
the
dear
little
mother
who
i
say
if
you
let
me
is
so
much
better
to
me
than
i
deserve
is
full
of
plans
for
furnishing
it
and
is
going
to
fit
up
a
beautiful
room
in
it
for
me
it
will
be
a
delightful
home
for
us
and
quite
grand
after
our
modest
cottage
but
do
you
know
i
goose
enough
to
be
homesick
at
the
thought
of
giving
up
my
little
den
under
the
roof
myself
and
i
have
had
such
jolly
times
together
in
it
she
had
scarcely
heard
him
except
the
first
words
and
the
stunning
facts
they
contained
there
was
a
minute
silence
then
she
spoke
in
a
changed
quivering
voice
then
that
will
be
the
end
of
our
friendship
i
suspect
when
you
get
out
of
the
neighborhood
and
are
off
most
of
the
time
at
the
university
we
will
doubtless
see
little
more
of
you
her
clear
blue
eyes
were
shining
up
at
him
through
tears
her
mouth
was
tremulous
as
a
distressed
child
the
appeal
met
an
instant
response
from
the
poet
the
hands
were
captured
this
time
and
held
fast
in
spite
of
their
fluttering
the
excessively
sweet
fragrance
of
the
blossom
in
her
hair
was
in
his
nostrils
her
quick
short
breaths
told
him
of
the
tempest
in
her
tender
young
bosom
myra
little
myra
do
you
care
like
that
he
cried
then
let
the
friendship
go
and
be
my
dear
little
sweetheart
wo
you
i
dying
of
loneliness
and
the
want
of
somebody
to
love
and
to
love
me
somebody
who
understands
me
and
you
do
do
you
myra
darling
she
was
too
happy
to
answer
but
she
suffered
him
to
put
his
arms
around
her
and
kiss
her
soft
pale
hair
and
her
brow
and
her
tremulous
mouth
the
first
kisses
of
love
to
him
as
well
as
to
her
and
ah
how
sweet
he
laughed
happily
lifted
out
of
his
gloom
by
this
new
this
deliriously
sweet
dream
do
you
know
little
sweetheart
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
bubbling
with
joy
i
feel
that
you
have
cast
those
devils
out
of
me
forever
it
was
you
that
i
wanted
all
the
time
and
did
not
know
it
some
of
these
days
when
i
been
through
college
and
settled
down
we
will
be
married
and
wherever
our
home
is
we
must
always
have
a
porch
like
this
with
a
rose
on
it
and
kissing
her
brow
you
must
always
wear
a
jessamine
in
your
hair
and
so
the
and
his
girl
very
much
to
their
own
surprise
parted
affianced
lovers
and
a
long
vista
of
sunlit
days
seemed
to
beckon
the
dreamer
chapter
x
the
session
at
the
university
did
not
begin
until
the
middle
of
february
so
love
young
dream
was
not
to
be
interrupted
too
soon
meantime
its
sweetness
was
only
enhanced
by
thought
of
the
coming
separation
the
affair
had
too
the
interest
of
secrecy
for
the
youthful
lovers
well
knew
the
storm
of
opposition
that
would
be
raised
in
both
their
homes
if
it
should
be
discovered
this
need
of
secrecy
made
frequent
meetings
and
exchange
of
vows
impossible
but
it
gave
to
such
as
occurred
the
flavor
of
stolen
sweets
and
kept
the
young
sinners
in
a
tantalized
state
which
was
excruciating
and
at
the
same
time
delightful
and
which
still
further
fed
the
flames
and
convinced
them
of
the
realness
and
intensity
of
their
passion
when
they
did
meet
their
awed
joyous
confessions
of
mutual
love
charmed
the
lonely
romantic
boy
by
their
very
novelty
in
them
his
fairest
dreams
were
fulfilled
how
sweet
it
was
in
these
rare
stolen
moments
to
crush
the
pure
young
creature
who
would
be
his
own
some
day
against
his
wildly
beating
heart
how
passing
sweet
to
hear
against
his
ear
her
whispered
hesitating
vows
of
deep
everlasting
love
in
his
pretty
new
room
overlooking
the
terraced
garden
of
the
stately
mansion
which
had
become
his
home
edgar
poe
plunged
headlong
into
byron
and
in
the
mood
thus
induced
penned
many
a
verse
no
worse
and
not
much
better
than
the
rhymes
of
lovelorn
youths
the
world
over
and
time
out
of
mind
to
be
copied
into
myra
album
between
the
and
preparation
for
college
time
took
wings
in
what
seemed
an
incredibly
short
space
summer
and
fall
were
gone
christmas
with
its
festivities
was
over
and
the
new
year
the
year
had
opened
it
was
upon
valentine
day
that
with
a
feeling
of
solemnity
worthy
of
the
act
the
seventeen
year
old
lover
and
student
wrote
the
name
edgar
allan
poe
and
the
date
of
his
birth
upon
the
matriculation
book
of
the
university
of
virginia
open
for
its
second
session
upon
the
day
before
the
beauty
and
the
poetry
of
the
place
had
burst
upon
him
and
this
first
impression
still
held
his
soul
in
thrall
here
in
this
fair
virginia
vale
ringed
about
with
the
hills
of
the
blue
ridge
the
scholastic
village
conjured
by
fertile
imagination
lay
before
him
in
the
clear
winter
sunshine
its
lawns
and
its
gardens
were
just
now
white
with
an
unbroken
blanket
of
snow
the
young
trees
which
had
been
planted
in
avenues
along
the
lawns
but
which
were
as
yet
hardly
more
than
shrubs
glittered
with
icicles
and
above
them
rose
the
classic
columns
of
the
colonnaded
dormitories
and
professors
houses
while
at
one
end
of
the
oblong
square
the
majestic
dome
and
columns
of
the
rotunda
stood
out
against
the
sky
as
the
entranced
dreamer
gazed
and
gazed
trying
to
imagine
what
it
must
be
like
by
moonlight
what
it
would
be
in
spring
what
a
few
years
later
when
the
trees
should
have
grown
large
enough
to
arch
the
walks
in
summer
he
told
himself
that
surely
in
this
of
the
old
dominion
bricks
and
mortar
had
sprung
into
immortal
bloom
and
he
found
himself
quoting
a
line
of
his
own
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
upon
his
earliest
opportunity
he
sat
down
and
wrote
myra
a
rhapsody
upon
it
all
her
presence
he
felt
and
he
wrote
her
was
all
needed
to
make
the
place
a
paradise
under
his
name
upon
the
matriculation
book
he
had
written
with
confidence
schools
of
ancient
and
modern
languages
in
the
school
of
ancient
languages
were
taught
according
to
the
announcement
for
the
year
hebrew
rhetoric
ancient
history
and
geography
in
the
school
of
modern
languages
french
spanish
italian
german
and
the
english
language
in
its
anglo
saxon
form
also
modern
history
and
modern
geography
a
list
one
would
think
to
daunt
the
courage
of
a
seventeen
year
old
student
and
make
him
feel
that
he
had
the
world
on
his
shoulders
it
was
quite
the
contrary
with
the
dreamer
he
felt
instead
that
he
had
suddenly
developed
wings
learning
came
easy
to
him
he
was
already
a
good
french
and
latin
scholar
and
the
rest
did
not
frighten
him
not
only
was
he
not
in
the
least
burdened
by
thought
of
the
work
he
was
cutting
out
for
himself
but
he
was
elated
by
a
sense
of
freedom
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
always
before
both
at
home
and
at
school
he
had
been
under
surveillance
but
now
he
was
to
be
a
partaker
of
the
benefits
of
jefferson
theories
of
the
treatment
of
students
as
men
and
gentlemen
letting
their
conduct
be
a
matter
of
in
the
youth
of
seventeen
this
sudden
withdrawal
of
oversight
and
regulation
produced
an
exhilaration
that
was
indeed
pleasurable
among
the
unfrequented
hills
known
as
the
ragged
mountains
not
far
away
was
a
wild
and
romantic
region
that
invited
him
to
fascinating
exploration
perhaps
adventure
instead
of
having
to
beg
permission
or
to
steal
off
upon
the
solitary
rambles
which
he
loved
to
this
enchanting
country
he
could
and
did
go
when
he
chose
openly
and
with
no
questions
asked
or
rebukes
given
he
held
up
his
head
with
a
new
confidence
at
the
thought
and
took
his
dreams
of
ambition
and
love
whenever
he
could
allow
himself
time
to
do
so
to
the
enticing
new
region
as
unlike
anything
around
richmond
as
if
it
were
in
a
different
world
adjacent
to
which
for
the
time
his
lot
lay
he
did
not
neglect
his
classes
however
they
were
regularly
attended
and
his
standing
was
excellent
so
the
professors
had
no
cause
for
making
inquiry
into
the
pursuits
of
his
private
hours
the
library
too
in
the
beautiful
rotunda
was
a
new
if
different
field
for
his
exploration
and
one
that
gave
him
great
delight
for
he
found
there
many
volumes
of
quaint
and
curious
lore
whose
acquaintance
he
had
never
before
made
his
imaginary
wings
were
soon
enough
to
be
clipped
his
exhilaration
to
drop
from
him
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
did
not
hear
from
myra
he
watched
eagerly
for
the
mails
and
as
day
after
day
passed
without
bringing
him
a
letter
deep
dejection
claimed
him
finally
he
wrote
to
her
again
and
then
again
and
again
frantically
appealing
to
her
to
write
to
him
and
assure
him
of
her
constancy
if
she
would
save
his
life
still
no
word
from
her
the
truth
was
that
myra
at
home
in
richmond
was
awaiting
each
as
feverishly
as
he
the
faint
suggestion
of
rose
her
cheeks
usually
wore
had
entirely
disappeared
and
deep
circles
caused
by
lack
of
sleep
and
lost
appetite
made
her
light
blue
eyes
appear
more
prominent
than
ever
before
the
ethereal
look
that
had
been
her
chief
claim
to
beauty
had
become
exaggerated
into
a
ghastliness
that
was
not
in
the
least
bewitching
she
like
edgar
had
pocketed
her
pride
and
followed
her
first
letter
with
others
more
and
more
expressive
of
her
tender
maiden
passion
but
her
father
who
had
begun
to
suspect
an
affair
between
her
and
the
players
son
a
short
time
before
edgar
left
for
the
university
had
kept
diligent
watch
for
the
passage
of
letters
and
had
successfully
intercepted
them
and
so
the
unhappy
pair
pined
and
sighed
and
gloomed
each
reckoning
the
other
faithless
and
believing
that
life
was
forever
robbed
of
joy
edgar
poe
had
never
really
loved
the
girl
he
had
merely
loved
the
dream
to
which
her
tender
words
and
timid
caresses
gave
an
adorable
reality
but
now
in
his
disappointment
at
not
hearing
from
her
he
felt
that
her
love
and
loyalty
to
him
were
the
only
things
in
the
world
worth
having
and
persuaded
himself
that
without
her
there
as
no
incentive
to
live
or
to
strive
his
misery
was
increased
by
an
homesickness
to
escape
from
which
he
wandered
restlessly
about
vainly
seeking
excitement
and
forgetfulness
in
this
mood
he
eagerly
accepted
an
invitation
to
spend
the
evening
from
a
whose
room
in
rowdy
row
had
a
reputation
for
conviviality
his
own
room
shared
by
a
quiet
and
steady
richmond
boy
with
whom
he
had
a
slight
acquaintance
at
home
was
in
one
of
the
dormitories
opening
upon
the
main
lawn
while
edgar
poe
had
been
a
somewhat
wayward
and
at
times
a
disobedient
boy
at
home
he
had
never
been
a
boy
except
when
judged
by
john
allan
standards
and
had
never
been
in
the
least
wild
wines
were
used
upon
the
table
of
his
as
upon
the
tables
of
other
gentlemen
whose
homes
he
had
visited
and
he
had
always
been
permitted
to
drink
a
small
quantity
at
a
time
at
dinner
or
to
sip
a
little
from
the
goblet
passed
around
before
breakfast
and
supposed
to
be
conducive
to
appetite
and
healthful
digestion
but
he
had
never
thought
of
exceeding
this
allowance
as
to
cards
he
knew
nothing
of
them
save
as
an
innocent
social
pastime
in
which
he
found
pleasure
as
in
all
other
games
and
sports
especially
such
as
required
exercise
of
ingenuity
or
mental
skill
the
evening
in
rowdy
row
was
therefore
a
revelation
as
well
as
a
diversion
to
him
as
he
approached
the
end
of
this
arcaded
row
in
which
his
new
friend
room
was
situated
his
interest
received
a
spur
from
the
sounds
of
hilarity
that
greeted
him
and
his
spirits
began
to
rise
in
a
few
moments
more
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
exceedingly
jolly
youths
evidently
prepared
to
make
a
night
of
it
several
of
them
were
gathered
about
a
huge
bowl
in
which
they
were
mixing
a
variety
of
punch
which
they
called
others
were
seated
around
a
card
table
while
one
of
their
number
entertained
the
rest
with
what
seemed
to
be
almost
magical
tricks
these
edgar
joined
his
interest
was
immediately
aroused
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
with
intentness
upon
the
juggler
the
tricks
were
new
to
him
but
he
soon
amazed
the
crowd
by
showing
the
solution
of
them
all
finally
the
punch
was
declared
to
be
ready
other
packs
of
cards
were
produced
and
the
real
sport
of
the
evening
began
it
was
edgar
first
experience
in
drinking
with
boys
and
his
conscience
not
yet
hardened
to
it
kept
him
in
check
without
worrying
him
enough
to
destroy
his
pleasure
somewhat
of
his
old
exhilaration
returned
to
him
at
the
bare
thought
for
he
felt
himself
a
man
following
his
own
will
and
yet
not
disobeying
any
direct
command
in
spite
of
much
urging
he
only
drank
one
glass
of
the
but
thanks
to
a
jovial
ancestor
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
but
of
some
of
whose
sins
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
law
he
bore
the
marks
in
his
temperament
he
was
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
influences
of
strong
drink
and
as
he
drained
the
glass
at
a
gulp
a
new
freedom
seemed
to
enter
his
soul
the
dejection
which
had
oppressed
him
dropped
from
him
instantly
and
with
his
great
eyes
glowing
like
lamps
with
new
zest
in
life
he
sat
down
at
a
card
table
to
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
fascinating
game
of
which
had
lately
become
the
fashion
and
at
the
same
time
into
his
first
experience
in
playing
for
money
he
had
beginner
luck
held
good
hands
and
won
straight
through
the
game
his
success
with
the
effects
of
the
punch
developed
his
wittiest
vein
and
edgar
goodfellow
assumed
complete
ascendancy
his
new
acquaintances
were
charmed
and
encouraged
his
mood
by
loud
applause
and
congratulated
themselves
upon
having
added
to
their
number
such
good
company
from
that
night
edgar
poe
new
friends
who
constituted
what
was
known
as
the
fast
set
at
the
university
became
his
boon
companions
it
was
in
the
much
more
than
the
that
the
charm
for
him
lay
for
the
gambling
fever
had
entered
his
blood
with
his
first
winnings
but
in
the
combination
of
the
two
he
found
for
the
present
a
sure
cure
for
his
blue
devils
alas
helen
where
was
your
sweet
spirit
that
it
did
not
hover
as
guardian
angel
about
the
head
of
this
wayward
child
of
genius
in
his
hour
of
sore
need
when
temptations
gathered
thick
around
his
pathway
and
there
was
no
one
to
steer
him
into
safer
waters
no
one
to
restrain
his
feet
from
their
first
blind
steps
toward
that
disaster
to
which
ruinous
companionship
invited
him
with
syren
voice
true
his
staid
miles
george
raised
his
voice
in
warning
against
the
dangerous
intimacies
he
was
forming
but
miles
view
seemed
extreme
to
him
besides
he
found
at
the
university
the
same
caste
feeling
that
had
cut
him
off
from
familiar
intercourse
with
the
leaders
among
his
richmond
schoolmates
it
was
but
natural
therefore
that
he
should
have
turned
gratefully
to
the
society
where
his
welcome
was
sure
finally
words
passed
between
him
and
miles
ending
in
a
formal
meeting
with
seconds
on
both
sides
their
only
weapons
were
their
fists
and
they
shook
hands
afterward
but
the
idea
of
continuing
to
share
the
same
was
out
of
the
question
of
the
vacant
rooms
to
be
had
edgar
promptly
decided
upon
number
rowdy
row
and
the
second
step
in
a
wrong
direction
quickly
followed
the
first
he
was
hailed
by
the
rest
of
the
row
with
delight
and
he
promptly
decided
to
return
their
many
hospitalities
in
his
new
room
which
he
proceeded
to
elaborately
prepare
for
their
reception
the
result
was
an
early
and
noisy
the
guests
were
filled
with
admiration
to
find
the
walls
of
number
decorated
in
honor
of
the
occasion
with
charcoal
sketches
representing
scenes
from
byron
works
done
by
the
clever
hand
of
the
new
occupant
himself
they
also
found
edgar
goodfellow
in
the
character
of
host
presiding
over
his
own
and
his
own
bowl
a
generous
one
of
in
the
highest
feather
and
his
most
captivating
mood
chapter
xi
erelong
number
was
the
liveliest
and
most
popular
room
in
the
row
but
of
the
orgies
held
there
the
faculty
rested
in
blissful
unconsciousness
at
young
poe
was
invariably
in
his
place
and
invariably
the
pale
thoughtful
and
faultlessly
neat
and
youth
whose
intelligent
attention
and
admirable
recitations
were
the
joy
of
his
masters
they
heard
rumors
that
he
was
something
of
a
poet
and
were
not
surprised
the
suggestions
of
ideality
in
the
formation
of
his
brow
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
hinted
at
such
talent
and
so
long
as
he
did
not
let
the
muse
come
between
him
and
his
regular
work
he
should
not
be
discouraged
or
restrained
indeed
in
spite
of
the
sway
of
edgar
goodfellow
at
this
time
edgar
the
dreamer
was
often
present
too
and
during
solitary
tramps
into
the
wild
fastenesses
of
the
ragged
mountains
he
not
only
conceived
many
fancies
to
be
worked
into
poems
but
made
mentally
the
first
draft
of
a
story
to
win
fame
the
love
of
no
real
woman
came
to
supplant
the
seemingly
faithless
elmira
and
though
he
still
carried
his
mother
miniature
with
him
and
gazed
often
and
fondly
upon
it
the
sense
of
nearness
between
her
spirit
and
his
and
the
soul
satisfaction
he
had
found
in
this
nearness
in
the
past
were
gone
the
gambling
fever
that
had
fired
his
veins
and
the
nightly
potations
of
created
an
excitement
and
restlessness
that
blurred
the
images
his
memory
held
of
the
angel
mother
who
had
dominated
his
childhood
and
of
the
mistress
who
had
filled
the
dreams
of
his
early
youth
these
holy
dreams
became
for
the
time
being
a
reproach
to
him
for
they
aroused
his
conscience
to
an
unpleasant
activity
which
required
more
frequent
recourse
to
to
quiet
love
was
nevertheless
as
necessary
to
this
poet
soul
as
meat
and
drink
were
to
his
body
and
in
the
no
man
land
out
of
space
out
of
time
which
his
fancy
created
and
where
it
loved
to
stray
he
fashioned
for
himself
the
weirdest
strangest
lady
ever
loved
by
mortal
the
name
he
gave
her
was
ligeia
she
laid
upon
him
no
exactions
chastened
him
with
no
rebukes
demanded
of
him
no
service
save
that
he
should
dream
and
dream
and
dream
for
was
not
she
herself
formed
from
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
the
music
of
nature
had
long
possessed
a
sort
of
personality
for
edgar
poe
and
now
the
voices
the
motions
the
numberless
colors
of
the
world
about
him
took
definite
shape
in
his
fancy
of
a
wonderous
whom
he
worshipped
with
an
unearthly
poetic
passion
that
was
compared
to
the
passion
of
the
normal
man
to
flesh
and
blood
woman
as
moonlight
to
sunshine
a
passion
which
was
luminous
without
heat
dim
and
elusive
as
is
the
very
conception
of
ligeia
to
the
ordinary
mind
she
was
perfectly
real
to
her
creator
in
the
breeze
he
heard
the
music
of
her
voice
and
felt
the
delicious
coolness
of
her
caress
tall
swaying
trees
spoke
to
him
of
her
height
her
majesty
and
her
grace
he
perceived
the
softness
and
lightness
of
her
footfalls
in
the
passage
of
evening
shadows
across
a
lake
or
meadow
the
perfection
of
her
features
in
the
form
and
finish
of
flower
petals
and
the
delicate
tints
of
her
beauty
in
the
coloring
of
flowers
the
raven
hue
and
sweeping
length
of
of
her
tresses
in
the
drowning
shades
of
midnight
and
the
entrancing
veil
of
her
lashes
in
deep
mysterious
woods
and
when
in
fancy
he
looked
beneath
that
veil
into
her
eyes
as
unfathomable
as
the
ocean
itself
he
was
struck
dumb
with
reverence
and
wonder
for
they
held
in
keeping
all
the
secrets
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
of
dawn
and
sunset
of
green
things
growing
and
flowers
in
bloom
of
the
butterfly
in
the
crysalis
and
on
the
wing
of
still
waters
and
of
running
brooks
to
the
inner
vision
of
this
most
unusual
youth
ligeia
this
myth
called
into
being
by
the
enchantment
of
his
own
fancy
not
only
became
as
real
as
if
she
had
been
flesh
and
blood
his
pagan
soul
bowed
down
before
her
and
she
blotted
from
his
mind
for
the
time
all
thought
or
consciousness
of
more
robust
womanhood
she
became
in
imagination
the
sharer
of
his
studies
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
he
sat
at
her
feet
and
gladly
learned
from
her
the
beautiful
strange
secrets
of
this
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
world
he
was
sometimes
haunted
by
another
and
a
far
less
agreeable
vision
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
restraint
under
which
he
lived
and
the
fact
that
between
his
dreams
his
books
and
his
dissipations
there
seemed
little
opportunity
left
for
the
still
small
voice
to
make
itself
heard
there
were
times
when
his
better
self
shook
off
slumber
and
rose
before
him
like
a
ghost
that
for
all
his
efforts
would
not
be
laid
a
ghost
like
him
in
all
regards
save
for
the
sternness
of
its
look
and
of
the
voice
which
accused
him
in
whispers
to
which
all
others
ears
were
deaf
but
his
own
intensely
horribly
sensitive
it
was
generally
at
the
very
height
of
excitement
in
play
when
he
had
just
been
dealt
a
hand
which
he
told
himself
with
exultation
would
win
him
all
the
money
in
the
pool
or
perhaps
at
the
moment
when
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
anticipating
the
delicious
exhilaration
of
the
seductive
that
the
unwelcome
spectre
would
with
startling
suddenness
appear
before
his
eyes
his
face
would
blanch
his
own
voice
become
almost
as
hoarse
as
the
warning
whisper
that
was
in
his
ear
and
with
trembling
hand
he
would
put
down
the
cards
or
the
cup
and
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
evening
sport
his
companions
at
first
thought
these
attacks
the
result
of
some
physical
weakness
but
finally
became
accustomed
to
them
and
attributed
them
to
his
queerness
thus
the
youthful
poet
passed
his
year
at
college
dividing
his
time
between
his
dreams
his
classes
and
his
carousals
the
session
closed
in
december
the
final
examinations
occupied
the
early
part
of
the
month
and
when
the
faculty
met
upon
the
it
was
found
that
edgar
poe
had
not
only
stood
well
in
all
of
his
studies
but
in
two
of
them
latin
and
french
he
had
taken
the
highest
honors
in
spite
of
this
and
of
the
fact
that
at
no
time
during
the
session
had
he
come
under
the
censure
of
the
faculty
a
startling
revelation
was
made
edgar
poe
model
student
as
he
seemed
to
be
whose
only
fault
if
it
could
be
called
a
fault
as
the
faculty
knew
him
had
been
a
tendency
toward
a
romantic
dreaminess
that
had
led
him
upon
lonely
rambles
among
the
hills
rather
eccentric
in
a
boy
of
seventeen
edgar
poe
the
quiet
the
gentlemanly
the
immaculately
neat
the
scholarly
the
poetic
had
been
a
spendthrift
and
a
reckless
gambler
his
debts
for
a
boy
of
his
age
were
astounding
no
one
was
more
amazed
at
the
sum
of
them
than
edgar
himself
he
had
always
had
the
lordly
indifference
to
money
and
the
contempt
for
keeping
account
of
it
that
was
the
natural
result
of
being
used
to
have
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
unlimited
supply
to
draw
upon
with
the
earning
of
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
as
to
hoarding
it
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
hoarding
the
air
he
breathed
which
came
to
him
with
no
less
effort
he
was
unfortunately
as
heedless
of
what
he
owed
as
what
he
spent
lavishing
it
upon
his
companions
as
long
as
it
lasted
and
when
his
supply
of
cash
was
exhausted
running
up
accounts
with
little
thought
of
a
day
of
reckoning
though
of
course
he
fully
intended
to
pay
his
mind
was
indeed
too
much
engrossed
with
the
charming
creations
of
his
brain
to
leave
him
time
for
brooding
upon
such
sordid
matters
as
the
keeping
of
accounts
or
the
making
of
two
ends
meet
the
amount
of
his
indebtedness
was
now
however
sufficient
to
give
him
a
shock
which
thoroughly
aroused
him
and
he
was
genuinely
distressed
for
he
had
no
wish
to
ruthlessly
pain
his
the
haunting
better
self
not
only
arose
and
confronted
him
but
remained
with
him
keeping
close
step
with
him
and
upbraiding
him
and
condemning
him
in
the
whisper
audible
to
his
quick
imagination
and
so
terrifying
still
the
thought
that
allan
had
plenty
of
money
and
that
no
severe
sacrifice
would
be
needful
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
relieved
his
penitence
of
much
of
its
poignancy
that
allan
would
settle
these
debts
of
honor
as
he
called
them
as
the
fathers
and
guardians
of
boys
as
reckless
as
himself
had
done
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
but
as
will
be
seen
he
reckoned
without
allan
he
wrote
allan
a
dutiful
letter
confessing
all
and
expressing
his
sorrow
and
begging
to
be
permitted
to
repay
allan
for
settling
his
affairs
at
the
university
with
work
as
a
clerk
in
the
counting
house
the
letter
filled
the
tender
heart
of
the
with
yearning
the
sum
frightened
her
though
she
like
the
boy
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
her
husband
could
pay
it
without
embarrassment
still
she
trembled
to
think
of
his
wrath
her
chief
feeling
was
one
of
sympathy
for
her
erring
penitent
boy
how
natural
it
was
for
one
of
his
age
to
be
led
away
by
evil
associates
all
boys
she
supposed
must
sow
some
wild
oats
though
few
she
was
confident
showed
such
a
beautifully
penitent
spirit
and
it
would
be
a
small
matter
in
future
years
when
he
should
have
become
the
great
and
good
man
she
knew
he
was
going
to
be
how
noble
it
was
of
him
to
offer
to
give
up
or
postpone
the
completion
of
the
education
so
dear
to
his
heart
and
tie
himself
to
a
desk
in
that
tiresome
in
order
to
pay
his
debts
he
that
was
born
to
shine
as
a
poet
she
exulted
that
he
had
offered
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
but
he
should
never
make
it
never
while
had
breath
in
her
body
to
protest
how
her
heart
bled
for
him
in
his
sorrow
over
his
how
she
longed
to
fold
his
dear
curly
head
against
her
breast
and
tell
him
that
he
was
quite
quite
forgiven
she
would
reward
him
for
the
splendid
stand
in
his
classes
and
at
the
same
time
make
him
forget
his
troubles
on
account
of
the
debts
by
giving
him
the
loveliest
imaginable
christmas
uncle
billy
must
search
the
woods
for
the
brightest
greens
the
prettiest
holly
for
the
house
must
look
its
merriest
for
the
of
its
young
master
covered
with
honors
there
must
be
mistletoe
too
she
told
herself
her
mouth
dimpling
and
a
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
flashing
out
from
under
her
dewy
lashes
the
fatted
calf
should
be
killed
her
boy
should
make
merry
with
his
friends
the
dear
letter
was
kissed
and
cried
over
until
it
took
much
smoothing
on
her
knee
to
make
it
presentable
to
hand
over
to
her
husband
for
perusal
her
fingers
were
still
busy
stroking
out
the
crumples
though
her
tears
were
dried
and
her
thoughts
were
happily
engaged
with
plans
for
a
christmas
party
worthy
to
celebrate
the
of
her
darling
when
allan
came
in
to
supper
she
was
brought
back
to
recollection
of
the
confession
in
the
letter
and
her
apprehensions
as
to
how
it
would
be
received
with
a
start
and
before
timidly
handing
her
husband
the
open
letter
she
began
preparing
him
for
its
contents
and
excusing
the
writer
a
letter
from
eddie
john
dear
he
has
stood
splendidly
in
his
classes
but
asks
your
forgiveness
for
having
done
wrong
in
his
spare
time
he
is
so
manly
and
noble
in
his
confession
john
and
in
his
offer
to
make
reparation
john
allan
face
clouded
and
hardened
instantly
what
is
this
confession
reparation
give
me
the
letter
but
she
held
it
away
from
him
it
seems
he
has
gotten
into
a
set
who
have
led
him
away
further
than
he
realized
oh
do
look
like
that
john
he
is
so
young
and
you
know
how
evil
association
can
influence
the
best
of
boys
but
the
storm
gathered
fast
and
faster
on
john
allan
face
do
you
mean
the
boy
has
been
gambling
give
me
the
letter
she
could
withhold
it
no
longer
but
as
he
sat
down
to
read
it
she
threw
herself
upon
an
ottoman
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
hid
her
face
against
them
crying
oh
john
have
pity
have
pity
but
even
as
she
sobbed
out
the
words
she
felt
their
futility
she
knew
that
there
was
no
pity
to
be
expected
from
the
owner
of
that
face
of
stone
that
eye
of
steel
as
he
read
his
rage
became
too
great
for
the
relief
of
an
outburst
a
still
but
icy
calm
settled
upon
him
for
some
minutes
he
spoke
no
word
and
seemed
unconscious
of
the
tender
creature
so
appealing
in
her
loveliness
and
in
the
humility
of
her
attitude
beseeching
at
his
knee
the
truth
was
that
much
as
he
loved
her
his
contempt
for
what
he
called
her
weakness
for
the
son
of
her
adoption
but
added
to
his
harshness
in
judging
the
boy
presently
he
arose
impatiently
pushing
her
away
from
him
as
he
did
so
saying
pack
my
bag
and
order
an
early
breakfast
i
going
to
take
the
morning
stage
for
the
university
it
was
a
difficult
evening
for
the
little
in
the
stately
soft
lamplight
was
cheerily
reflected
by
gleaming
mahogany
and
bright
silver
and
china
upon
which
was
served
the
most
toothsome
of
suppers
but
the
meal
was
almost
untouched
and
the
mere
pretense
of
eating
was
carried
through
in
silence
and
gloom
in
the
afterward
the
firelight
leaped
saucily
against
shining
andirons
and
fender
bringing
forgetfulness
of
the
frosty
night
outside
while
the
carved
and
the
great
mirrors
and
paintings
in
their
gilded
frames
on
the
walls
and
the
deep
carpets
on
the
floors
spoke
of
comfort
but
the
beautiful
room
was
a
mockery
for
the
promised
comfort
was
not
there
only
futile
luxury
upon
that
bright
hearth
was
warmth
for
the
body
but
none
for
the
spirit
for
before
it
sat
the
master
and
mistress
the
presiding
geniuses
of
the
house
upon
whose
oneness
the
structure
of
the
must
stand
or
without
it
fall
into
ruin
there
they
sat
wrapped
in
moods
so
out
of
sympathy
and
tune
that
speech
was
as
impossible
between
them
as
if
they
had
been
of
different
tongues
and
each
unknown
to
the
other
meantime
edgar
poe
was
spending
his
last
hours
at
the
university
in
the
dust
and
ashes
of
and
regretful
retrospection
no
farewell
orgie
celebrated
his
only
one
of
his
friends
was
invited
to
his
room
that
night
and
he
no
denizen
of
rowdy
row
but
the
quiet
irreproachable
librarian
to
this
gentle
guest
the
dreamer
confided
his
past
sins
and
his
penitence
while
he
laid
upon
the
glowing
coals
the
year
accumulation
of
exercise
books
and
the
like
which
had
served
their
purpose
and
were
finished
and
done
with
and
watched
the
devouring
flames
leap
from
the
little
funeral
pyre
they
made
into
the
chimney
more
than
anything
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
he
told
his
companion
he
regretted
the
making
of
the
gambling
debts
for
which
allan
would
have
to
advance
the
money
to
pay
but
as
has
been
said
he
reckoned
without
allan
who
settled
all
other
obligations
but
utterly
ignored
the
debts
of
honor
debts
of
honor
he
queried
with
contempt
debts
of
i
consider
them
and
that
was
his
last
word
upon
the
subject
chapter
xii
the
late
january
night
was
bitterly
cold
and
clear
as
crystal
there
was
a
metallic
glitter
about
the
round
moon
shining
down
from
a
cloudless
blue
sky
too
bright
to
show
a
star
upon
the
black
and
bare
trees
and
shrubbery
in
the
terraced
garden
of
the
allan
homestead
edgar
poe
looked
from
his
casement
upon
the
splendor
of
the
beautiful
but
frigid
and
unsympathetic
night
bitterness
was
in
his
heart
contending
with
a
fierce
joy
at
last
it
had
come
the
breach
with
allan
and
he
was
going
away
he
knew
not
where
but
he
was
going
going
into
the
wide
world
to
seek
fame
and
fortune
he
had
much
to
regret
he
loved
richmond
loved
it
for
the
joy
and
pain
he
had
felt
in
it
for
the
dreams
he
had
dreamed
in
it
he
loved
it
exceedingly
for
the
two
dear
graves
one
in
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
and
one
in
the
new
cemetery
that
held
his
beloved
dead
yes
he
was
sorry
to
leave
this
if
not
of
his
birth
at
least
of
his
childhood
and
early
youth
and
his
soul
was
still
shaken
by
the
scene
with
his
through
which
he
had
just
passed
but
in
spite
of
all
his
heart
rejoicing
in
the
nearness
of
the
freedom
for
which
he
had
so
fiercely
longed
sang
and
stilled
his
sorrow
but
a
few
weeks
had
passed
since
his
return
from
the
university
a
few
weeks
they
seemed
to
him
years
and
each
one
had
left
a
feeling
of
increased
age
upon
his
spirit
the
had
not
been
altogether
unhappy
humiliating
as
it
was
in
spite
of
the
black
looks
of
his
the
little
mother
bless
her
had
welcomed
him
with
arms
and
eyes
beaming
with
undimmed
love
never
had
she
been
more
tenderly
sweet
and
dear
she
had
given
the
most
beautiful
christmas
party
with
all
his
best
friends
invited
and
everything
just
as
she
knew
he
would
like
it
her
husband
had
frowningly
consented
to
this
but
her
tears
and
entreaties
were
all
of
no
avail
to
win
his
consent
for
the
boy
return
to
college
vainly
had
she
plead
his
talents
which
she
believed
should
be
cultivated
and
the
injustice
since
they
had
voluntarily
assumed
the
responsibility
of
rearing
him
of
cutting
short
his
education
at
such
an
early
age
john
allan
was
adamant
and
so
after
the
holidays
he
had
taken
his
place
in
the
of
ellis
and
allan
distasteful
as
the
new
work
was
to
the
young
poet
he
was
determined
to
stick
to
it
and
would
probably
have
done
so
but
the
strict
surveillance
he
soon
realized
he
was
under
as
if
he
could
not
be
trusted
and
the
manner
of
allan
who
rarely
spoke
to
him
except
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
hopeless
criminal
would
have
been
unbearable
to
a
far
less
proud
and
sensitive
nature
than
edgar
poe
both
at
the
office
and
at
home
narrow
eyes
seemed
to
keep
constant
watch
under
their
beetling
brows
for
faults
or
blunders
and
it
seemed
to
the
driven
boy
that
no
matter
what
he
did
or
said
he
should
have
done
or
said
just
the
reverse
he
felt
constantly
that
a
storm
was
brewing
which
must
sooner
or
later
certainly
break
and
that
night
it
had
burst
forth
with
all
the
fury
of
the
tempest
which
has
been
a
long
time
gathering
he
hardly
knew
what
had
brought
it
on
or
how
it
had
begun
its
violence
was
so
great
as
to
almost
stun
him
until
at
length
without
being
more
than
half
conscious
of
the
significance
of
his
own
words
he
had
asked
if
it
would
not
be
better
for
him
to
go
away
and
earn
his
own
living
and
then
came
his
startlingly
ready
consent
with
the
warning
that
if
he
did
go
he
must
look
for
no
further
aid
from
him
his
heart
ached
for
the
pretty
tender
little
mother
how
soft
the
arms
that
had
clung
about
his
neck
the
lips
that
had
pressed
his
hot
brow
how
piteous
her
dear
tears
they
had
almost
robbed
him
of
his
resolution
but
he
had
succeeded
in
steeling
himself
against
this
weakness
he
had
folded
her
close
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
vowed
that
come
what
might
he
could
never
forget
her
or
cease
to
love
her
and
that
he
should
always
think
of
her
as
his
mother
and
himself
as
her
child
then
he
had
put
her
gently
from
him
for
for
all
his
vows
she
was
inseparably
bound
up
in
the
old
life
from
which
he
was
breaking
away
his
life
as
john
allan
adopted
son
she
could
have
no
real
place
in
his
future
yet
the
tie
that
bound
him
to
her
was
the
strongest
in
his
life
and
could
not
be
severed
without
keen
pain
in
the
world
into
which
he
was
going
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
he
told
himself
memory
of
her
would
be
one
of
his
inspirations
but
where
was
that
battle
to
be
fought
and
with
what
weapons
he
had
been
brought
up
as
a
rich
man
son
and
with
the
expectation
of
being
a
rich
man
heir
he
had
been
trained
to
no
work
physical
or
mental
and
now
he
was
to
fare
forth
into
the
great
world
where
there
was
not
a
familiar
face
even
to
earn
his
bread
what
could
he
do
that
would
bring
him
the
price
of
a
loaf
did
the
question
appal
him
not
in
the
least
he
had
youth
he
had
health
he
had
hope
he
had
his
beloved
talent
and
the
secret
training
he
had
given
himself
toward
its
cultivation
his
were
a
lute
he
felt
it
and
with
an
optimism
rare
for
him
he
also
felt
that
he
had
but
to
strike
upon
that
lute
and
the
world
must
needs
stop
and
listen
what
he
did
not
have
was
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
world
little
did
he
dream
how
small
a
part
of
the
busy
hive
would
turn
aside
to
hear
his
music
or
how
little
poetry
had
to
do
with
the
earning
of
daily
bread
his
trunk
was
standing
open
half
packed
though
his
destination
was
still
undecided
and
among
the
first
things
that
had
gone
into
it
was
a
box
containing
a
number
of
small
rolls
of
neat
manuscript
as
he
thought
of
them
his
heart
warmed
and
his
eyes
grew
soft
the
world
mine
oyster
and
with
my
good
pen
i
open
it
he
joyously
paraphrased
but
toward
what
part
of
the
world
should
he
turn
his
face
to
what
market
take
his
precious
wares
that
was
the
question
how
much
his
fortune
might
depend
upon
his
decision
as
he
stood
at
the
window
he
stared
into
the
brilliancy
and
the
shadows
of
the
icy
unresponsive
night
seeking
a
sign
but
the
cold
splendor
of
the
cloudless
sky
and
glittering
moon
and
the
inscrutible
shadows
in
the
garden
below
where
the
leafless
trees
and
bushes
cast
monster
shapes
upon
the
frozen
ground
alike
mocked
him
presently
there
was
the
first
hint
of
softness
in
the
night
it
came
like
a
sigh
of
tender
pity
across
the
stillness
and
he
bent
his
head
to
listen
it
was
the
voice
of
the
faintest
of
breezes
blowing
up
from
the
south
and
passing
his
window
he
threw
wide
his
arms
to
empty
space
as
if
to
embrace
some
invisible
form
ligeia
ligeia
my
beautiful
one
he
breathed
invoking
his
be
my
counsellor
and
guide
let
thy
sweet
voice
whisper
whither
i
must
go
but
the
voice
was
silent
and
all
the
night
was
still
again
he
turned
from
the
window
and
threw
himself
into
his
letting
his
eyes
rove
about
the
room
as
though
he
would
seek
a
sign
from
its
walls
suddenly
he
sat
erect
his
dilated
pupils
fixed
upon
a
point
above
the
upon
a
small
picture
it
was
a
little
sketch
done
by
the
hand
of
his
versatile
mother
and
found
among
her
belongings
after
her
death
like
her
miniature
and
her
letters
the
picture
had
followed
him
through
his
life
and
had
always
adorned
the
walls
of
his
room
often
and
over
he
had
studied
it
until
he
knew
by
heart
every
stroke
of
the
brush
that
entered
into
its
composition
yet
he
stared
at
it
now
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
finally
he
took
it
down
from
its
place
on
the
chimney
and
held
it
in
his
hands
gazing
upon
it
in
deep
abstraction
underneath
the
picture
was
written
its
title
boston
harbor
morning
and
upon
its
back
for
my
little
boy
edgar
who
must
love
boston
the
place
of
his
birth
and
where
his
mother
found
her
best
and
most
sympathetic
friends
the
picture
gave
him
the
sign
with
rising
excitement
he
decided
that
it
must
be
accepted
to
boston
of
course
he
would
go
boston
the
place
of
his
birth
and
where
his
angel
mother
had
found
her
best
most
sympathetic
friends
he
would
get
away
as
early
the
next
morning
as
possible
he
told
himself
he
would
waste
no
time
in
goodbyes
for
he
remembered
with
some
bitterness
there
were
few
to
say
goodbye
to
the
boys
were
all
off
at
college
again
now
that
the
holidays
were
over
and
as
for
myra
she
had
quickly
consoled
herself
and
was
already
a
wife
he
had
addressed
some
reproachful
verses
to
her
as
a
bride
then
dismissed
her
from
his
thoughts
he
arose
and
placed
the
picture
carefully
in
the
trunk
with
the
rest
of
his
treasures
and
then
went
to
bed
to
fall
into
the
easy
slumber
of
one
whose
mind
is
well
made
up
a
few
days
later
edgar
poe
had
looked
with
delight
and
ineffable
emotion
upon
the
real
boston
harbor
with
its
rocky
little
islets
and
its
varied
shipping
and
its
busy
wharves
and
for
him
its
suggestions
of
one
in
heaven
chapter
xiii
upon
his
arrival
in
boston
our
errant
knight
before
setting
out
upon
his
quest
for
the
fame
and
fortune
to
whose
service
he
was
sworn
spent
some
hours
in
wandering
about
the
old
town
with
mind
open
to
the
quickening
influences
of
historic
association
and
eye
to
the
irregular
picturesque
beauty
about
him
it
was
one
of
those
rare
days
that
come
sometimes
in
the
month
of
february
when
though
according
to
the
callendar
it
should
be
cold
there
is
a
warmth
in
the
sunshine
that
seems
borrowed
from
spring
tired
out
by
his
tramp
young
edgar
at
length
sat
down
upon
a
bench
in
the
common
under
an
elm
great
of
girth
and
the
sunshine
fell
pleasantly
upon
him
through
the
bare
branches
roundabout
were
other
splendid
but
now
bare
elms
and
he
sat
gazing
upward
into
their
sturdy
brown
branches
and
dreamily
picturing
to
himself
the
beauty
of
these
goodly
trees
clothed
in
the
green
vesture
of
summer
suddenly
by
a
whimsical
sequence
of
suggestion
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
the
sunshine
of
february
as
it
reached
him
under
the
tree
in
boston
common
vividly
called
to
mind
the
refreshing
coolness
of
the
shade
of
the
elms
in
full
leaf
as
he
a
little
lad
of
six
had
walked
the
streets
of
old
for
the
first
time
there
was
little
relation
between
that
first
and
this
present
parting
with
the
allans
yet
in
his
mind
they
became
inseparably
connected
he
recalled
his
happiness
in
his
first
essays
at
composition
made
at
the
manor
school
and
told
himself
that
though
he
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
that
was
the
first
step
toward
his
life
work
he
was
now
here
in
boston
the
city
of
his
birth
about
to
take
the
second
for
the
hour
had
arrived
when
his
work
would
be
given
to
the
world
across
his
knees
he
held
the
box
containing
his
precious
manuscripts
he
arose
from
the
bench
and
turning
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
common
walked
with
brisk
hopeful
step
down
town
in
the
direction
of
a
publishing
house
whose
location
he
had
already
ascertained
edgar
poe
had
known

and
imaginary
he
was
now
to
have
his
first
meeting
with
disappointment
bitter
and
grim
of
all
the
persons
who
had
ever
seen
his
work
every
one
had
been
warm
in
its
praise
everyone
saving
john
allan
only
some
had
been
positively
glowing
true
they
had
not
been
publishers
yet
among
them
there
had
been
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
taste
and
culture
but
here
was
a
different
matter
here
was
a
personage
with
whom
he
had
not
reckoned
but
who
was
the
door
as
it
were
through
which
his
work
must
pass
into
the
world
he
was
unmistakably
a
personage
his
bearing
though
modest
spoke
of
power
his
dress
though
unobtrusive
was
in
the
perfect
taste
which
only
the
prosperous
can
achieve
and
maintain
his
features
were
cast
in
the
mold
of
the
he
was
past
middle
age
and
his
naturally
fine
countenance
was
beautiful
with
the
ennobling
lines
which
time
leaves
upon
the
face
of
the
seeker
after
truth
he
was
courteous
most
bostonians
and
many
publishers
are
he
was
sympathetic
he
was
undoubtedly
intellectual
but
the
eyes
that
regarded
through
big
spectacles
the
romantic
beauty
the
prominent
brow
and
the
distinguished
air
of
the
youth
before
him
wore
a
not
only
thoughtful
but
something
more
a
distinctly
shrewd
and
practical
expression
in
them
was
no
awe
of
the
bare
mention
of
original
poetry
he
took
the
little
rolls
of
manuscript
into
his
strong
and
at
the
same
time
smooth
and
hands
and
drew
them
out
to
their
full
length
with
the
manner
of
one
who
handled
as
good
every
day
he
cast
his
eyes
rapidly
down
the
sheets
rapidly
it
seemed
to
the
poet
with
a
not
unkind
yet
critical
air
while
the
sensitive
youth
before
him
turned
red
and
white
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
learned
something
of
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
it
was
really
but
a
very
short
space
but
to
the
boy
who
seemed
suspended
between
a
life
and
a
death
sentence
it
was
an
age
finally
he
experienced
something
like
a
drowning
sensation
while
he
heard
a
voice
that
barely
penetrated
the
flood
of
deep
waters
that
was
rolling
over
his
head
saying
words
that
were
intended
to
be
kind
about
the
work
showing
promise
in
spite
of
an
absence
of
marketable
value
marketable
value
heavens
was
he
back
in
john
allan
counting
house
what
could
the
man
mean
it
was
as
literature
not
as
merchandize
that
he
wanted
his
poetry
to
be
judged
in
his
dismay
he
stammered
something
of
the
sort
only
to
be
told
that
when
his
poetry
was
made
into
a
book
it
would
become
merchandize
and
it
mattered
not
how
good
as
poetry
it
might
be
the
publisher
could
do
nothing
with
it
unless
as
merchandize
it
would
probably
be
valuable
too
then
he
had
been
politely
bowed
out
with
his
package
still
under
his
arm
during
the
few
minutes
he
had
spent
in
the
publisher
office
the
sky
had
become
overcast
and
a
biting
east
wind
had
blown
up
from
the
river
but
the
change
in
the
outside
world
was
as
nothing
to
that
within
him
he
had
not
known
how
large
a
part
of
himself
was
his
dream
of
becoming
a
poet
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
all
of
him
had
from
the
beginning
of
his
life
been
all
of
him
since
those
old
days
at
he
had
been
building
building
building
this
castle
in
the
air
now
at
one
fell
blow
the
whole
fabric
was
laid
in
ruin
weakness
seized
his
limbs
and
deep
dejection
his
spirits
his
life
might
as
well
come
to
an
end
for
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
live
for
how
indeed
was
he
to
live
when
the
only
work
he
knew
how
to
do
had
no
marketable
value
the
money
with
which
allan
supplied
him
before
he
left
home
to
give
him
a
start
would
soon
be
exhausted
what
if
he
should
not
be
able
to
make
more
though
he
was
in
the
city
of
his
birth
he
found
himself
an
absolute
stranger
if
any
of
those
who
had
been
sympathetic
friends
to
his
mother
were
left
he
had
no
idea
who
or
where
they
were
he
went
back
to
the
lodgings
he
had
engaged
to
a
night
of
bitter
sleepless
tossing
but
with
the
new
day
youth
and
hope
asserted
themselves
he
decided
that
he
would
not
accept
as
final
the
verdict
of
any
one
publisher
though
that
one
stood
at
the
head
of
the
list
with
others
however
it
was
just
the
same
and
another
night
of
even
greater
wretchedness
followed
upon
his
third
day
in
boston
he
felt
that
he
had
been
there
a
year
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
spirit
broken
ambition
gone
finally
in
washington
street
he
discovered
upon
a
small
door
a
modest
sign
bearing
the
legend
calvin
thomas
printer
with
freshly
springing
hope
he
entered
the
little
shop
and
was
received
by
a
pale
and
somewhat
threadbare
youth
of
about
his
own
age
who
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
announced
himself
as
mr
thomas
between
these
two
boys
as
they
stood
looking
frankly
into
each
eyes
that
mysterious
thing
which
we
call
sympathy
which
like
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
no
man
knoweth
whence
it
cometh
or
whither
it
goeth
sprang
instantly
into
being
the
one
found
himself
without
his
usual
diffidence
declaring
himself
a
poet
in
search
of
a
publisher
and
the
other
was
at
once
alert
with
interest
calvin
thomas
had
but
just
timorously
for
he
was
poor
as
well
as
young
set
up
his
little
shop
hoping
to
build
up
a
trade
as
a
printer
to
be
a
publisher
had
not
entered
into
his
wildest
imaginings
much
less
a
publisher
for
a
poet
but
he
was
like
his
visitor
a
dreamer
and
like
him
ambitious
why
should
he
not
be
a
publisher
as
well
as
a
printer
the
poet
had
not
his
manuscripts
with
him
but
offered
to
recite
some
extracts
which
he
did
with
glowing
voice
and
gesture
explaining
figures
of
speech
and
allusions
as
he
went
along
edgar
poe
sat
easily
upon
a
high
stool
in
the
little
shop
his
dress
was
handsome
and
as
always
exquisite
in
its
neatness
and
taste
his
whole
appearance
and
bearing
were
marked
by
an
air
which
deeply
impressed
the
young
printer
who
had
promptly
fallen
under
the
spell
of
his
personal
charm
he
had
laid
his
hat
upon
the
desk
baring
the
glossy
brown
ringlets
that
clustered
about
his
large
pale
brow
his
features
were
mobile
and
eager
his
dark
grey
eyes
full
of
life
his
voice
had
a
wonderful
musical
quality
becoming
passionate
when
as
at
present
his
feeling
was
deeply
aroused
his
poetry
recited
thus
gained
much
of
distinction
its
crudities
would
have
been
lost
to
a
great
extent
even
upon
a
critic
but
thomas
was
no
critic
he
was
simply
a
dreamy
youth
with
a
mind
open
to
the
beautiful
and
the
romantic
the
flights
of
the
poet
fancy
did
not
seem
to
him
obscure
or
too
fantastic
they
admitted
him
to
a
magic
world
in
which
he
sat
until
silence
brought
him
back
to
his
tiny
bare
shop
which
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
glorified
it
is
wonderful
he
breathed
he
began
to
picture
himself
as
not
only
sharing
the
wealth
but
the
fame
which
the
publication
of
these
gems
was
bound
to
bring
but
he
had
to
explain
that
he
was
poor
and
that
he
could
not
bring
out
the
poems
without
financial
aid
the
money
which
had
been
given
edgar
to
set
out
in
the
world
with
was
already
dwindling
but
he
managed
to
subscribe
a
sum
which
thomas
declared
would
be
sufficient
with
the
little
he
himself
could
add
for
the
printing
of
a
modest
edition
in
a
very
modest
garb
chapter
xiv
in
the
allan
mansion
in
richmond
there
was
a
stillness
that
was
oppressive
no
young
sounded
upon
the
stair
no
boyish
laughter
rang
out
in
rooms
or
hall
there
were
handsome
and
formal
dinners
occasionally
when
some
elderly
distinguished
stranger
was
entertained
but
there
were
no
more
merry
dancing
parties
with
old
cy
playing
the
fiddle
and
calling
the
figures
frances
allan
fair
and
graceful
still
though
looking
somewhat
out
of
health
and
broken
as
her
friends
remarked
to
one
another
trod
softly
about
the
stately
rooms
with
no
song
on
her
lip
no
gladness
in
her
step
her
husband
was
grown
suddenly
prematurely
old
and
his
speech
was
less
frequent
and
harsher
than
before
he
was
more
immersed
in
business
than
ever
and
was
prospering
mightily
but
the
fact
seemed
to
bring
him
no
satisfaction
even
the
old
servants
had
lost
much
of
their
mirth
their
black
faces
were
grown
solemn
and
their
tread
heavy
they
looked
with
awe
upon
their
mistress
when
as
frequently
happened
they
saw
her
quietly
enter
marse
eddie
room
and
close
the
door
behind
her
in
that
room
and
there
alone
the
fair
gentle
woful
creature
gave
free
reign
to
the
grief
of
her
stricken
the
room
was
kept
just
as
her
boy
had
left
it
for
she
constantly
hoped
against
hope
that
he
would
return
hers
was
the
aching
grief
of
a
mother
whose
child
is
dead
yet
she
is
denied
the
solace
of
mourning
here
was
the
bed
which
had
pillowed
his
dear
sunny
ringlets
here
were
his
favorite
chair
his
desk
his
books
in
a
little
trunk
against
the
wall
were
his
toys
with
some
of
the
pretty
clothes
made
with
her
own
fingers
in
which
it
had
been
her
pride
to
dress
him
when
he
was
a
wee
laddie
how
she
loved
to
finger
and
fondle
them
fifteen
years
she
had
been
his
mother
now
this
was
all
she
had
somewhere
in
the
same
world
with
her
he
was
living
was
walking
about
talking
eating
sleeping
yet
he
was
dead
to
her
oh
if
she
could
only
know
that
he
was
happy
that
he
was
well
that
he
lacked
nothing
in
the
way
of
creature
comfort
if
she
could
know
where
he
was
picture
him
at
work
or
in
his
leisure
hours
it
would
not
be
so
hard
to
bear
but
she
knew
nothing
nothing
save
that
he
had
gone
to
boston
one
letter
she
had
had
from
him
there
such
a
dear
one
she
knew
it
by
heart
in
it
he
had
called
her
mother
and
assured
her
of
his
constant
love
and
thought
of
her
he
had
arrived
safely
he
said
and
would
soon
be
busy
making
his
living
boston
was
a
fine
city
and
full
of
interest
to
him
when
his
ship
came
in
he
was
going
to
have
her
come
on
and
pay
him
a
visit
there
he
would
write
again
when
he
had
anything
worth
telling
days
had
passed
weeks
and
no
word
had
come
had
he
failed
to
obtain
employment
had
he
gone
further
to
new
york
perhaps
or
philadelphia
she
did
not
know
oh
if
she
could
but
was
he
ill
fear
clutched
her
heart
and
made
her
faint
the
suspense
was
terrible
and
she
had
no
one
to
go
to
for
sympathy
no
one
she
dared
not
mention
her
anxiety
to
her
husband
it
made
him
furious
he
could
not
stand
the
sound
of
eddie
name
even
her
darling
beautiful
eddie
her
arms
felt
so
empty
they
ached
winter
was
passing
the
garden
that
eddie
loved
so
dearly
was
coming
to
life
the
crocuses
for
which
he
always
watched
with
so
much
interest
were
come
and
gone
the
jonquils
were
in
bloom
and
the
first
sweet
hyacinths
blue
as
turquoises
she
had
gathered
and
put
in
his
room
it
cheered
her
to
see
them
there
somehow
they
made
the
room
look
more
ready
than
usual
as
if
he
might
come
home
that
day
he
did
not
come
but
something
else
did
a
letter
with
the
boston
she
had
so
longed
to
see
and
a
small
flat
package
addressed
to
her
in
his
dear
hand
she
broke
the
seal
of
the
letter
first
she
was
so
hungry
for
the
sight
of
the
familiar
mother
dear
and
to
know
how
he
fared
it
was
a
short
letter
but
ah
the
blessed
relief
of
knowing
he
was
well
and
happy
and
prospering
famously
for
he
told
her
he
was
sending
her
the
first
copy
off
the
press
of
his
book
of
poems
it
was
a
book
he
said
but
it
was
a
beginning
he
felt
within
him
that
he
would
have
much
bigger
and
better
things
to
show
her
erelong
for
the
present
he
was
hard
at
work
making
ready
for
a
revised
and
enlarged
edition
of
his
book
if
one
should
be
called
for
there
was
a
jubilant
note
in
the
letter
that
delighted
her
and
communicated
itself
to
her
own
spirits
she
eagerly
tore
the
wrappings
from
the
package
and
pressed
the
contents
against
her
lips
and
her
heart
it
was
but
a
slender
volume
cheaply
printed
and
bound
but
it
was
her
boy
first
published
work
and
a
wonderful
thing
in
her
eyes
she
already
saw
him
rich
and
famous
saw
him
come
home
to
her
crowned
with
honor
and
success
she
turned
the
pages
of
the
book
he
had
written
upon
the
some
precious
words
of
presentation
to
her
she
kissed
them
rapturously
and
passed
on
to
the
tamerlane
and
other
poems
by
a
bostonian
boston
calvin
thomas
printer
she
was
still
gloating
over
her
treasure
when
the
brass
knocker
on
the
front
door
was
sounded
and
a
minute
later
myra
royster
now
shelton
was
announced
taking
the
book
with
her
she
tripped
downstairs
singing
as
she
went
and
burst
in
upon
myra
as
she
sat
in
state
in
the
in
all
her
bridal
finery
myra
noticed
as
she
kissed
her
her
glowing
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
how
well
you
are
looking
today
allan
she
exclaimed
it
is
happiness
dear
i
just
had
such
a
delightful
letter
from
eddie
and
this
darling
little
book
it
is
his
poems
myra
myra
was
all
interest
to
think
of
knowing
a
real
live
author
she
exclaimed
i
was
sure
eddie
would
be
famous
some
day
but
had
no
idea
it
would
come
so
soon
do
you
wish
you
had
waited
for
him
teased
allan
laughing
happily
they
chatted
over
the
wonderful
news
until
nearly
and
after
they
had
parted
allan
sat
at
the
window
watching
for
her
husband
to
come
home
that
she
might
impart
it
to
him
at
the
earliest
moment
possible
but
when
at
last
he
appeared
she
put
off
the
great
moment
until
after
dinner
and
then
when
he
was
comfortably
smoking
a
fragrant
cigar
she
approached
him
timidly
and
placed
the
letter
and
the
book
in
his
lap
without
a
word
what
all
this
he
questioned
sharply
she
made
no
reply
but
hovered
about
his
chair
too
excited
to
trust
herself
to
speak
he
picked
up
the
letter
and
read
it
with
a
deepening
frown
then
opened
the
book
and
ran
his
eyes
hurriedly
down
one
or
two
of
its
pages
at
length
he
spoke
so
this
is
the
way
he
wasting
his
time
and
i
dare
say
his
money
too
will
the
boy
ever
amount
to
anything
i
wonder
the
happiness
in
frances
allan
face
gave
place
to
quick
distress
oh
john
she
cried
do
you
think
it
amounts
to
anything
for
a
boy
of
eighteen
to
have
written
and
published
a
book
of
poetry
poetry
this
stuff
is
bosh
utter
bosh
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
there
was
defiance
in
her
gentle
face
her
clinging
air
was
discarded
she
raised
her
head
and
with
flashing
eyes
and
rising
color
faced
him
you
think
that
because
you
can
not
understand
or
appreciate
it
she
retorted
with
spirit
neither
do
i
understand
it
but
i
can
see
that
it
is
wonderful
poetry
if
he
can
do
this
at
eighteen
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
make
himself
and
us
famous
before
many
years
are
past
her
husband
only
reply
was
an
astonished
and
piercing
stare
which
she
met
without
flinching
then
turned
and
swept
from
the
room
leaving
him
with
a
feeling
of
surprise
to
see
that
she
was
so
tall
her
self
assertion
was
but
momentary
as
she
ascended
the
stair
and
entered
eddie
room
all
the
elasticity
was
gone
from
her
step
all
the
brightness
from
her
cheeks
and
eyes
and
still
clasping
her
boy
letter
and
book
to
her
heart
she
threw
herself
upon
his
bed
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
meantime
the
elms
on
boston
common
were
clothed
with
tender
april
green
and
under
foot
sweet
soft
grass
was
springing
in
this
inspiring
cathedral
walked
edgar
poe
his
pale
face
and
deep
eyes
passionate
with
the
worship
of
beauty
that
filled
his
soul
lifted
to
the
greening
arches
above
him
his
sensitive
ears
entranced
with
the
that
fluted
through
the
cool
aisles
his
mind
was
teeming
with
new
poems
in
the
making
and
with
visions
of
what
he
should
do
if
his
book
should
sell
but
it
did
not
sell
the
leading
magazines
acknowledged
its
receipt
in
their
review
columns
but
with
the
merest
mention
which
was
exceedingly
disconcerting
it
was
discussed
but
with
disappointment
for
a
week
by
his
friends
at
home
and
at
the
university
to
whom
he
sent
copies
then
was
forgotten
and
now
its
author
was
for
the
first
time
within
his
recollection
beginning
to
feel
the
pinch
of
poverty
his
money
was
almost
gone
and
he
saw
no
immediate
hope
of
getting
more
he
moved
to
the
cheapest
boarding
house
he
could
find
but
he
did
not
mind
that
so
much
as
the
prospect
that
faced
him
of
soon
beginning
to
present
a
shabby
appearance
in
public
his
shoes
were
already
showing
wear
and
he
found
that
to
keep
his
linen
as
immaculate
as
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
have
it
cost
money
and
he
actually
had
to
economize
in
the
quantity
of
clothing
he
had
laundered
this
to
his
proud
and
fastidious
nature
was
humiliating
in
the
extreme
he
and
calvin
thomas
held
frequent
colloquies
as
to
ways
and
means
of
giving
his
book
wider
circulation
he
visited
the
offices
of
the
several
newspapers
of
the
town
in
the
hope
of
getting
work
in
the
line
of
journalism
reporting
reviewing
anything
in
the
way
of
the
only
business
or
profession
for
which
he
felt
that
he
had
any
aptitude
or
preparation
but
without
success
at
length
the
sign
of
calvin
thomas
printer
had
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
little
shop
in
washington
street
and
a
dismal
to
let
was
in
its
place
at
about
the
same
time
blanks
lost
the
handsome
quiet
young
gentleman
who
had
evidently
seen
better
days
from
her
unpretentious
lodging
house
and
the
walks
under
the
elms
in
boston
common
were
no
longer
trodden
by
the
dreamer
from
virginia
chapter
xv
where
was
edgar
poe
twice
since
he
shook
the
dust
of
richmond
joyfully
from
his
feet
fair
springtide
had
visited
the
terraced
garden
of
the
allan
home
twice
the
green
had
come
forth
first
like
a
misty
veil
then
like
a
mantle
enveloping
its
trees
and
its
shrubs
its
arbors
and
trellises
twice
the
procession
of
flowers
led
by
the
crocuses
in
their
petticoats
of
purple
and
yellow
had
tripped
from
underground
twice
the
homing
birds
had
built
in
the
myrtles
and
among
the
snowy
pear
and
cherry
blossoms
and
filled
all
the
place
with
music
twice
too
in
this
garden
the
pageant
of
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
had
passed
the
birds
had
flown
away
again
and
winter
snows
had
covered
all
with
their
whiteness
and
their
silence
and
still
the
garden
the
poet
the
dreamer
was
a
wanderer
where
oh
beautiful
ligeia
was
it
not
your
voice
that
now
and
again
whispered
in
the
and
among
the
flowers
could
you
not
did
you
not
bring
news
of
the
wanderer
if
she
did
there
was
no
human
being
to
whom
her
language
was
intelligible
and
the
trees
and
the
flowers
keep
their
secrets
well
within
the
homestead
there
was
little
change
save
a
deepening
of
the
quietness
that
had
fallen
upon
it
in
the
master
of
the
house
there
was
no
visible
difference
there
are
some
men
who
seen
from
year
to
year
seem
as
unchanging
as
the
sphinx
it
is
only
after
a
long
period
that
any
difference
in
them
can
be
detected
and
then
they
suddenly
appear
broken
and
aged
the
fair
lady
of
the
manor
was
as
fair
as
ever
but
with
the
pale
tremulous
fairness
of
a
late
star
in
the
grey
dawn
of
a
new
day
in
which
it
will
have
no
part
her
bloom
her
roundness
her
gaiety
all
these
were
gone
she
spent
more
time
than
ever
in
the
room
which
waiting
for
its
roving
tenant
became
more
and
more
like
a
death
chamber
the
silence
there
was
not
now
broken
by
her
sobs
even
for
it
was
with
grief
that
she
watched
and
waited
for
her
boy
these
days
watched
and
waited
and
prayed
ah
how
she
prayed
for
him
body
and
soul
prayed
that
wherever
he
might
be
he
might
be
kept
from
harm
and
strengthened
to
resist
temptation
was
it
her
agonized
petitions
that
kept
him
to
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
duty
during
those
two
years
amid
uncongenial
surroundings
and
hard
conditions
who
knows
yet
the
chair
and
the
desk
and
the
books
and
the
vases
of
fresh
flowers
on
the
mantel
and
the
resting
on
the
shining
andirons
ready
for
a
match
and
the
reading
lamp
with
trimmed
wick
and
bright
chimney
on
the
table
and
the
canopied
white
bed
still
waited
in
vain
his
coming
many
months
had
passed
since
the
name
of
eddie
had
been
spoken
between
husband
and
wife
but
though
she
held
her
peace
like
mary
of
old
like
mary
too
she
pondered
many
things
in
her
heart
he
loving
her
well
but
having
no
aptitude
for
divining
woman
ways
indulged
in
secret
satisfaction
for
he
took
her
silence
to
mean
that
she
was
coming
to
her
senses
and
regarding
the
boy
as
he
did
that
she
no
longer
importuned
him
to
enquire
into
edgar
whereabouts
with
the
intention
of
inviting
him
home
was
a
source
of
especial
relief
to
him
then
upon
a
day
two
years
after
she
had
triumphantly
placed
book
and
letter
in
his
hands
it
was
his
turn
to
bring
her
a
letter
you
see
the
bad
penny
has
turned
up
again
he
remarked
dryly
she
looked
questioningly
at
the
folded
sheet
its
was
fortress
monroe
and
the
was
not
familiar
to
her
what
is
it
she
asked
a
letter
from
archer
he
surgeon
at
the
fort
you
know
read
it
it
is
about
edgar
with
shaking
hands
and
a
blanched
face
she
spread
open
the
sheet
a
nameless
dread
possessed
her
a
letter
about
eddie
not
from
him
and
from
a
surgeon
for
a
moment
darkness
seemed
to
descend
upon
her
and
she
could
not
make
out
the
characters
before
her
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
in
sudden
alarm
her
husband
rushed
to
a
celaret
nearby
and
brought
out
a
decanter
of
wine
pouring
a
glass
he
pressed
it
to
her
lips
eddie
she
gasped
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
is
he
well
in
spite
of
john
allan
anxiety
he
was
irritated
and
showed
it
pshaw
frances
he
exclaimed
i
hoped
you
had
forgotten
the
boy
yes
he
well
and
i
glad
to
say
in
a
place
where
he
is
made
to
behave
she
calmed
herself
with
an
effort
and
began
to
read
the
letter
the
story
it
told
had
a
smack
of
romance
archer
had
he
wrote
been
called
to
the
hospital
in
the
fort
to
see
a
private
soldier
by
the
name
of
edgar
perry
who
was
down
with
fever
the
patient
spoke
but
little
but
the
doctor
was
struck
with
his
marked
refinement
of
look
and
manner
and
there
was
something
familiar
to
him
about
the
prominent
brow
and
full
grey
eyes
though
the
name
was
strange
to
him
his
attention
was
aroused
and
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
impression
that
he
had
seen
the
young
man
before
he
mentioned
the
fact
to
some
of
the
officers
and
found
at
once
that
his
patient
was
a
subject
of
deep
interest
to
them
they
felt
sure
they
told
him
that
he
had
a
story
his
polished
manners
and
bright
and
cultivated
conversation
seemed
to
them
incongruous
with
the
duties
of
a
private
soldier
and
they
laughingly
said
that
they
suspected
they
were
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
yet
his
duties
were
performed
with
the
utmost
faithfulness
and
efficiency
he
had
never
been
heard
to
speak
of
himself
or
his
past
in
a
way
which
would
throw
any
light
upon
his
history
and
his
reserve
was
of
the
kind
which
was
bound
to
be
respected
archer
had
grown
he
wrote
more
and
more
interested
in
his
patient
as
he
became
better
acquainted
with
him
and
being
convinced
that
the
young
man
had
for
some
reason
gotten
out
of
his
proper
sphere
he
determined
to
try
and
help
him
back
to
it
by
the
time
the
young
soldier
was
convalescent
the
doctor
had
won
his
confidence
and
obtained
from
him
the
confession
that
the
name
of
perry
was
an
assumed
one
and
that
he
was
none
other
than
allan
adopted
son
edgar
poe
whom
archer
had
not
seen
since
he
was
a
small
boy
the
discovery
of
his
identity
had
greatly
increased
the
good
interest
and
he
and
the
officers
of
the
fort
were
of
the
opinion
that
as
young
poe
had
made
a
model
soldier
having
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
for
good
conduct
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
for
him
was
to
secure
his
discharge
and
get
him
an
appointment
to
west
point
this
allan
could
bring
about
he
thought
through
men
of
influence
whose
friendship
the
doctor
knew
he
enjoyed
edgar
had
enlisted
for
five
years
he
had
confessed
that
at
the
time
he
had
been
almost
upon
the
point
of
starvation
and
had
turned
to
the
army
when
every
effort
to
find
other
means
of
livelihood
had
failed
the
doctor
and
other
officers
thought
that
it
would
be
a
great
sacrifice
to
leave
a
young
gentleman
of
edgar
abilities
to
three
more
years
of
such
uncongenial
life
he
was
quite
recovered
and
in
accordance
with
a
promise
made
the
doctor
was
writing
to
allan
at
that
moment
did
eddie
letter
come
too
allan
asked
as
she
finished
the
one
in
her
hand
without
a
word
her
husband
handed
it
over
to
her
in
it
edgar
expressed
much
contrition
for
the
trouble
which
his
larger
experience
in
life
told
him
he
had
cost
his
and
asked
his
forgiveness
he
also
asked
that
allan
would
follow
the
suggestion
of
archer
and
apply
for
a
discharge
from
the
army
for
him
and
an
appointment
to
west
point
he
had
not
written
his
mother
in
the
past
because
he
had
unfortunately
nothing
to
tell
which
he
believed
could
give
her
any
pleasure
but
he
sent
her
his
undying
love
frances
allan
looked
through
wet
lashes
into
her
husband
face
but
her
eyes
were
shining
through
the
tears
oh
john
she
said
breathlessly
you
will
have
him
to
come
and
make
us
a
little
visit
before
he
goes
to
west
point
wo
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
was
the
emphatic
reply
he
seems
to
be
getting
along
very
well
where
he
is
let
him
stick
it
out
feeling
how
vain
her
pleadings
would
be
yet
not
willing
to
give
up
hope
she
wept
she
prayed
she
hung
upon
john
allan
neck
she
brought
every
argument
that
starved
motherhood
could
conceive
to
bear
upon
him
to
think
that
eddie
was
in
virginia
just
down
at
old
point
the
cup
of
joy
was
too
near
her
lips
to
let
it
pass
without
a
mighty
effort
but
finally
she
gave
up
and
shrank
within
herself
drooping
like
the
palest
of
lilies
then
came
a
day
when
a
stillness
such
as
it
had
never
known
before
hung
over
the
allan
home
the
garden
was
at
its
fairest
the
halls
and
the
with
their
rich
furnishings
and
works
of
art
were
as
beautiful
as
ever
but
there
was
not
even
a
bereaved
mother
with
an
expression
on
her
face
like
that
of
mary
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
to
tread
the
lonely
floors
the
luxurious
rooms
were
quite
quite
empty
all
save
one
an
upper
chamber
where
upon
a
stately
carved
and
canopied
bed
lay
all
that
was
mortal
of
frances
allan
like
a
lily
indeed
when
pitiless
storm
has
laid
it
low
the
learned
doctors
who
had
attended
her
had
given
long
latin
names
to
her
malady
in
their
books
there
was
mention
of
no
such
ailment
as
heartbreak
and
so
happily
the
desolate
man
left
to
preside
in
lonely
state
over
the
goodly
which
her
presence
had
filled
and
made
sweet
and
satisfying
was
spared
a
suspicion
even
of
the
real
cause
of
her
untimely
end
his
one
consuming
desire
for
the
present
was
that
all
things
should
be
done
just
as
she
would
wish
and
so
all
minor
bitternesses
drowned
in
the
one
overwhelming
bitterness
of
his
loss
he
scribbled
a
few
hurried
lines
to
edgar
poe
acquainting
him
with
the
sad
news
and
telling
him
to
apply
for
a
leave
and
come
home
at
once
but
the
mails
and
travel
were
slow
in
those
days
and
when
the
young
soldier
reached
richmond
the
last
sad
rites
were
over
and
for
the
third
time
in
his
brief
career
the
grave
had
closed
over
a
beautiful
woman
who
had
loved
him
and
upon
whose
personality
had
been
based
in
part
that
ideal
of
woman
as
goddess
or
angel
before
which
his
spirit
throughout
his
life
with
all
its
vicissitudes
bowed
down
as
the
lumbering
old
stage
crawled
along
the
road
toward
richmond
he
lived
over
again
the
years
spent
in
the
sunshine
of
her
presence
her
death
was
a
profound
shock
to
him
how
strange
that
one
so
fair
so
merry
so
bubbling
with
should
cease
to
be
would
it
always
be
his
fate
he
wondered
to
love
where
untimely
death
was
lying
in
wait
upon
the
night
when
he
reached
home
and
every
night
till
his
furlough
over
he
returned
to
his
post
of
duty
at
fortress
monroe
he
lay
in
his
old
room
with
his
old
household
gods
his
books
in
their
shelves
his
pictures
on
the
walls
his
desk
and
deep
and
other
objects
made
dear
by
daily
use
in
their
accustomed
places
and
the
lamplight
gloating
around
him
he
was
touched
at
the
sweet
familiar
look
of
it
all
and
at
the
thoughtfulness
of
himself
of
which
he
saw
signs
everywhere
could
it
be
that
he
had
been
two
years
an
exile
from
these
homelike
comforts
or
had
it
been
only
one
of
his
dreams
in
spite
of
the
void
her
absence
made
it
was
good
to
be
back
good
after
his
wanderings
to
come
into
his
own
again
in
the
hush
and
loneliness
of
those
few
days
under
the
same
roof
the
man
and
youth
their
pride
broken
by
their
common
sorrow
came
nearer
together
than
they
ever
had
been
before
it
seemed
that
the
gentle
spirit
of
her
whom
each
had
loved
hovered
about
them
binding
them
to
each
other
by
invisible
but
sacred
cords
john
allan
spoke
to
the
players
son
in
tones
that
were
almost
fatherly
and
with
quick
response
the
youth
became
again
the
edgar
of
the
days
before
reminders
of
his
dependence
upon
charity
had
opened
his
eyes
to
the
difference
between
a
real
and
an
adopted
father
under
this
reconciling
influence
the
youth
poured
out
expressions
of
penitence
for
the
past
and
made
resolutions
for
the
future
and
allan
promised
to
apply
for
the
desired
appointment
to
west
point
but
added
that
thereafter
he
should
consider
himself
relieved
of
all
responsibility
concerning
edgar
this
blunt
and
ungracious
assurance
strained
the
bond
between
the
adopted
father
and
son
the
promised
letter
of
application
to
the
secretary
of
war
ruthlessly
shattered
it
that
his
indulgencies
during
his
year
at
the
university
of
virginia
so
freely
and
earnestly
repented
should
have
been
exposed
in
the
letter
seemed
to
the
boy
unnecessary
and
cruel
but
the
man
who
had
been
fifteen
years
his
father
the
husband
of
her
over
whom
the
grave
had
but
just
closed
and
who
had
always
loved
him
edgar
as
an
own
and
only
son
had
seen
fit
to
add
to
the
declaration
he
left
me
in
consequence
of
some
gambling
debts
at
the
university
a
disclaimer
of
even
a
sentimental
interest
in
him
frankly
sir
the
letter
said
i
do
declare
that
edgar
poe
is
no
relation
to
me
whatever
that
i
have
many
in
whom
i
have
taken
an
active
interest
in
order
to
promote
theirs
with
no
other
feeling
than
that
every
man
is
my
care
if
he
be
in
distress
edgar
poe
duly
presented
the
letter
but
the
bitterness
which
during
his
brief
visit
home
had
been
put
to
sleep
raised
its
head
and
robbed
him
of
all
pleasure
in
his
anticipated
change
and
of
much
of
the
incentive
to
put
forth
his
best
effort
in
it
he
felt
that
the
result
of
this
ungracious
letter
must
be
to
blot
the
new
leaf
which
he
had
so
ardently
desired
to
turn
with
shadows
of
his
past
which
no
effort
of
his
own
could
entirely
obliterate
for
the
soreness
of
finding
himself
disowned
as
allan
son
this
time
publicly
in
a
manner
he
found
somewhat
of
balm
in
the
letter
of
cordial
praise
addressed
to
the
honorable
secretary
of
war
in
his
behalf
by
the
father
of
his
old
friend
jack
preston
preston
described
him
as
a
young
gentleman
of
genius
who
had
already
gained
reputation
for
talents
and
attainments
at
the
university
of
virginia
and
added
i
would
not
write
this
recommendation
if
i
did
not
believe
he
would
remunerate
the
government
at
some
future
day
by
his
services
and
talents
for
whatever
may
be
done
for
him
happily
for
the
at
times
morbidly
sensitive
youth
he
had
soon
forgotten
the
sting
caused
by
the
letter
in
a
return
to
the
dreams
which
he
regarded
as
not
only
the
chief
joy
but
the
chief
business
of
his
life
for
though
he
was
preparing
himself
for
the
profession
of
a
soldier
he
had
never
for
a
moment
forsworn
the
muse
of
poetry
for
a
whole
year
before
being
transferred
to
fortress
monroe
he
had
been
stationed
at
fort
moultrie
in
charleston
harbor
there
his
wonderful
ligeia
had
seemed
especially
near
to
him
and
often
when
the
day
work
was
done
and
he
recognized
her
voice
in
the
music
of
the
waves
or
felt
her
kiss
in
the
soft
southern
air
blown
across
spicey
islets
he
would
up
and
away
with
her
across
the
world
on
the
silver
track
or
on
nights
when
no
moon
came
up
out
of
the
sea
would
wander
with
her
through
the
sky
there
was
one
fair
star
that
invited
his
fancy
with
peculiar
insistence
it
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
with
the
flashes
of
its
beams
he
questioned
ligeia
of
it
and
she
told
him
that
it
was
none
other
than
al
aaraaf
the
great
star
discovered
by
tycho
brahe
which
after
suddenly
appearing
and
shining
for
a
few
nights
with
a
brilliancy
surpassing
that
of
jupiter
disappeared
never
to
be
seen
again
never
except
by
him
the
dreamer
to
whom
it
was
given
not
only
to
gaze
upon
it
from
the
far
earth
but
with
her
as
his
guide
to
visit
it
and
to
explore
its
fairy
landscape
where
the
spirits
of
lost
sculptures
enjoyed
immortality
the
result
of
this
flight
of
fancy
to
a
magical
world
was
the
poem
al
aaraaf
he
spent
the
interim
between
his
honorable
discharge
from
the
army
and
his
entrance
at
west
point
in
a
happy
visit
to
baltimore
where
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
father
kindred
and
succeeded
in
publishing
the
new
poem
with
a
revised
edition
of
the
old
ones
for
the
first
time
his
work
appeared
under
his
own
signature
al
aaraaf
tamerlane
and
minor
poems
by
edgar
a
poe
the
new
poem
was
unintelligible
to
the
critics
but
what
of
that
he
asked
himself
one
of
his
optimistic
moods
was
upon
him
he
despised
the
critics
for
their
lack
of
perception
and
as
he
held
the
slim
volume
in
his
hands
and
gazed
upon
that
to
him
wondrous
his
countenance
shone
as
though
it
had
caught
the
reflection
of
the
magic
star
itself
what
mattered
all
the
wounds
all
the
woes
of
his
past
life
he
had
entered
into
a
land
where
dreams
came
true
for
the
first
time
too
his
work
received
recognition
as
poetry
in
the
literary
world
it
was
but
a
nod
yet
it
was
a
beginning
and
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
this
first
nod
of
greeting
as
a
poet
came
to
him
from
boston
where
his
mother
had
found
her
best
most
sympathetic
friends
before
publishing
his
new
book
he
had
sent
some
extracts
from
it
to
john
neal
editor
of
the
and
boston
literary
who
promptly
gave
them
a
place
in
his
paper
with
some
kind
words
commending
them
to
lovers
of
genuine
poetry
he
is
entirely
a
stranger
to
me
wrote
the
boston
editor
of
the
poet
but
with
all
his
faults
if
the
remainder
of
al
aaraaf
and
tamerlane
are
as
good
as
the
body
of
the
extracts
here
given
he
will
deserve
to
stand
high
very
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
shining
brotherhood
in
a
burst
of
gratitude
the
happy
poet
wrote
to
neal
his
thanks
for
these
very
first
words
of
encouragement
he
had
received
i
am
young
he
confided
to
this
earliest
friend
in
the
charmed
world
of
letters
i
am
young
not
yet
twenty
a
poet
if
deep
worship
of
all
beauty
can
make
me
one
and
wish
to
be
so
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
chapter
xvi
upon
a
dark
and
drizzling
november
night
of
the
year
four
cadets
of
west
point
academy
sat
around
a
cosy
open
fire
in
room
south
barracks
spinning
yarns
for
each
other
amusement
one
of
them
the
one
with
the
always
handsome
and
scholarly
at
times
soft
and
romantic
but
tonight
face
was
easily
recognizable
as
edgar
the
goodfellow
frequently
appearing
in
the
quite
opposite
character
of
edgar
the
dreamer
and
commonly
known
as
edgar
poe
his
fellow
cadets
had
dubbed
him
the
bard
two
of
this
young
companions
were
his
in
number
old
p
and
gibs
and
the
third
was
a
visitor
from
north
barracks
taps
had
sounded
sometime
since
and
the
barracks
were
supposed
to
be
wrapt
in
slumber
but
for
these
young
men
the
evening
had
just
begun
several
hours
had
elapsed
since
supper
and
it
is
a
fact
that
there
is
never
a
time
or
a
season
when
a
college
boy
is
not
ready
to
eat
someone
suggested
that
politeness
demanded
they
should
entertain
their
guest
with
a
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
benny
haven
shop
and
proposed
that
they
should
draw
straws
to
determine
which
of
the
three
hosts
should
fetch
the
necessary
supplies
they
had
no
money
but
the
accommodating
bard
agreed
to
sacrifice
his
blanket
in
the
cause
of
hospitality
and
armed
with
that
and
several
pounds
of
tallow
candles
gibs
upon
whom
the
lot
had
fallen
set
forth
to
run
the
blockade
to
benny
this
was
a
risky
business
for
the
vigilance
of
lieutenant
joseph
locke
one
of
the
instructors
in
tactics
who
was
also
a
sort
of
supervisor
of
the
morals
and
conduct
of
cadets
was
hard
to
elude
as
one
of
the
bard
own
effusions
ran
john
locke
was
a
very
great
name
joe
locke
was
a
greater
in
short
the
former
was
well
known
to
fame
the
latter
well
known
to
report
the
best
that
benny
would
give
in
addition
to
the
bottle
for
the
blanket
and
candles
was
an
old
gander
whose
stentorian
and
voice
he
obligingly
hushed
by
chopping
off
its
head
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
the
storm
gibs
succeeded
in
safely
returning
to
the
barracks
but
not
until
his
hands
and
his
shirt
were
reeking
with
the
gander
gore
the
bard
who
was
anxiously
awaiting
the
result
of
the
foraging
expedition
ventured
outside
to
meet
him
when
he
beheld
the
prize
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
good
for
you
but
you
look
like
a
murderer
caught
his
own
words
almost
before
they
left
his
lips
suggested
to
him
an
idea
for
a
mammoth
hoax
the
best
they
had
tried
yet
he
told
himself
he
hastily
and
in
whispers
unfolded
it
to
gibs
whom
he
found
all
sympathy
then
returned
alone
to
his
friends
in
number
reporting
that
he
had
seen
nothing
of
their
messenger
and
expressing
fear
that
he
had
met
with
an
accident
all
began
to
watch
the
door
with
anxiety
after
some
minutes
it
burst
open
and
gibs
who
had
carefully
laid
the
gander
down
outside
staggered
into
the
room
appearing
to
be
very
drunk
and
brandishing
a
knife
which
he
had
rubbed
against
the
fowl
bleeding
neck
old
and
the
visitor
from
north
barracks
too
frightened
for
words
sat
as
though
rooted
to
their
chairs
while
the
bard
sprang
to
his
feet
and
in
a
voice
exclaimed
heavens
gibs
what
has
happened
joe
locke
joe
locke
gasped
gibs
well
what
of
joe
locke
speak
man
he
wo
report
me
any
more
i
killed
him
pshaw
exclaimed
the
bard
in
disgust
this
is
another
of
your
practical
jokes
and
you
know
it
i
thought
you
would
say
that
so
i
cut
off
his
head
and
brought
it
along
here
it
is
with
that
he
quickly
opened
the
door
and
picked
up
the
gander
and
whirling
it
around
his
head
dashed
it
violently
at
the
one
candle
which
was
thus
knocked
over
and
extinguished
leaving
the
room
in
darkness
but
for
a
few
smouldering
embers
on
the
hearth
and
with
the
gruesome
addition
to
the
company
of
what
two
of
those
present
believed
to
be
the
severed
head
of
lieutenant
locke
the
visitor
with
one
bound
was
out
of
the
room
through
the
window
and
made
good
his
escape
to
his
own
quarters
in
north
barracks
where
he
spread
the
astounding
news
that
gibs
had
murdered
joe
locke
it
was
certainly
so
for
his
head
was
then
in
number
south
barracks
old
nearly
frozen
with
fright
did
not
move
from
his
place
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
the
bard
and
gibs
brought
him
back
to
a
normal
condition
and
induced
him
to
assist
in
preparing
the
fowl
which
had
played
the
part
of
joe
locke
head
in
the
little
comedy
for
the
belated
feast
which
was
merrily
partaken
of
but
without
the
guest
of
honor
edgar
poe
had
entered
west
point
in
july
but
hardly
had
its
doors
closed
behind
him
when
his
optimism
gave
place
to
wretchedness
and
he
began
to
feel
that
his
appointment
was
a
mistake
he
had
taken
a
fine
stand
in
his
classes
but
he
recognized
at
once
a
state
of
things
most
unpleasant
for
him
for
which
he
had
not
been
prepared
as
in
his
schooldays
in
richmond
and
at
the
university
a
number
of
the
boys
had
withheld
their
intimacy
from
him
on
account
of
caste
feeling
so
now
at
west
point
he
found
history
repeating
itself
but
with
a
difference
in
richmond
and
at
the
university
it
had
been
as
the
child
of
the
stage
and
as
a
dependent
upon
charity
that
the
line
was
drawn
against
him
with
the
aristocratic
cadets
it
was
because
of
his
promotion
from
the
ranks
yet
the
very
experience
which
brought
their
contempt
upon
him
gave
him
a
sense
of
superiority
that
made
their
manner
toward
him
the
harder
to
bear
and
drilling
with
green
boys
after
having
been
two
years
a
soldier
he
found
most
irksome
while
the
snubbing
to
which
he
was
subjected
was
general
enough
to
make
his
situation
extremely
unpleasant
however
it
was
by
no
means
unanimous
gibs
and
old
his
convivial
in
number
took
him
to
their
hearts
at
once
and
he
really
liked
them
when
he
was
in
the
mood
for
companions
of
their
type
but
they
wore
cruelly
upon
his
nerves
when
the
divine
fire
within
him
was
burning
so
indeed
would
any
for
at
home
always
and
most
of
the
time
at
the
university
one
of
his
chief
comforts
had
been
his
own
room
where
he
could
shut
out
all
the
world
and
be
alone
with
his
dreams
there
was
at
west
point
nothing
like
a
repetition
of
his
course
at
the
university
the
trouble
which
his
attack
of
gambling
fever
had
gotten
him
into
had
proved
a
severe
but
wholesome
lesson
and
he
had
let
cards
alone
at
once
and
forever
in
his
ignorance
of
his
own
family
history
he
did
not
know
that
for
one
of
his
blood
the
only
safety
lay
in
total
abstinence
from
the
cup
that
cheers
but
the
intense
and
instantaneous
excitement
he
found
a
single
glass
of
wine
produced
in
his
brain
an
excitement
amounting
almost
to
madness
was
in
itself
a
warning
to
him
and
kept
him
strictly
within
the
bounds
of
moderation
there
were
times
however
when
with
a
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
purchased
secretly
from
old
benny
and
smuggled
at
great
hazard
into
the
room
edgar
goodfellow
could
with
zest
join
his
rolicking
in
making
merry
and
in
spite
of
his
strict
adherence
to
the
single
glass
generally
them
at
their
own
games
but
there
was
no
place
in
that
room
for
edgar
the
dreamer
and
between
the
routine
and
discipline
of
classes
and
drills
with
youths
for
the
most
part
younger
than
himself
and
inferior
in
mentality
and
cultivation
but
who
bore
themselves
as
his
superiors
and
the
impossibility
of
an
hour
of
solitude
the
lovely
ligeia
became
unreal
and
remote
he
could
no
longer
catch
the
sounds
of
her
voice
or
feel
her
presence
near
his
muse
too
had
become
shy
and
difficult
and
when
she
deigned
to
visit
him
at
all
it
was
generally
in
the
quite
new
character
of
jester
in
cap
and
bells
under
whose
influence
he
dashed
off
humorous
and
satirical
squibs
at
the
expense
of
the
professors
and
students
of
which
the
lines
on
lieutenant
locke
are
a
specimen
these
he
recited
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
parties
that
gathered
in
number
by
whom
they
were
regarded
as
of
wit
and
were
circulated
through
the
school
but
he
took
no
real
pleasure
in
this
perversion
of
his
poetical
gift
and
feeling
his
soul
cramped
and
cabined
by
the
uncongeniality
of
his
surroundings
he
soon
became
convinced
that
west
point
was
not
the
place
for
him
and
that
he
should
leave
it
as
soon
as
possible
he
wrote
allan
of
his
dissatisfaction
begging
his
assistance
in
securing
a
discharge
at
no
time
would
this
request
have
been
granted
but
it
came
at
the
most
inopportune
moment
imaginable
some
time
before
certain
ladies
in
richmond
who
professed
to
know
the
signs
had
given
out
the
interesting
news
that
allan
was
taking
notice
true
it
was
that
though
such
a
thing
had
seemed
impossible
his
stocks
were
higher
and
more
precisely
folded
than
ever
his
broadcloth
was
of
a
finer
texture
his
shone
with
a
brighter
lustre
but
the
most
marked
change
in
him
was
a
certain
springiness
of
gait
altogether
new
to
his
calves
and
almost
youthful
and
a
pleased
expression
of
the
hitherto
stern
eyes
and
mouth
which
made
his
usually
solemn
vizage
look
as
if
it
might
break
out
into
smiles
at
any
moment
the
signs
the
ladies
said
dated
from
the
arrival
of
at
powhatan
the
country
seat
of
the
mayo
family
just
below
richmond
of
a
fair
guest
miss
louisa
patterson
of
philadelphia
this
lady
was
no
longer
young
according
to
the
severe
standards
of
that
time
of
early
marriages
and
correspondingly
early
but
so
much
the
better
as
she
was
therefore
of
suitable
age
for
the
elderly
though
spruce
and
prosperous
widower
she
was
withal
a
decidedly
personable
woman
with
the
elegant
manners
and
conversation
of
the
inner
circles
of
the
exclusive
stately
society
in
which
she
had
been
nurtured
just
the
woman
the
fair
prophetesses
said
to
rule
over
john
allan
for
everybody
knew
that
a
man
who
ruled
his
first
wife
was
invariably
ruled
by
his
second
and
to
preside
with
distinction
and
taste
over
his
and
his
board
she
was
as
suitable
in
fact
for
the
wife
of
ripe
age
as
the
frances
had
been
for
the
wife
of
youth
so
richmond
gave
its
unqualified
approval
nothing
could
have
been
more
out
of
harmony
with
the
sound
of
the
mellow
wedding
bells
pealing
for
this
happy
pair
than
a
reminder
of
the
first
wife
of
the
bridegroom
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
from
edgar
poe
when
poe
had
entered
west
point
his
had
drawn
a
long
breath
of
relief
he
believed
that
the
idle
youth
with
whom
his
dead
wife
had
been
so
strangely
infatuated
was
off
his
hands
for
good
and
all
when
the
letter
came
to
jar
upon
his
new
dream
of
love
he
was
irritated
and
in
his
brief
mention
of
the
matter
to
his
bride
it
was
very
apparent
and
left
upon
her
mind
the
impression
that
frances
allan
must
have
been
a
weak
and
silly
creature
indeed
to
have
fancied
an
idle
ungrateful
boy
who
spent
his
time
drinking
gambling
and
scribbling
ridiculous
poetry
the
son
of
an
actress
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
such
a
low
character
and
herself
to
have
remained
under
the
same
roof
for
a
day
she
was
sure
and
she
told
her
husband
so
imparting
to
her
tone
somewhat
of
the
pity
she
felt
to
think
of
his
having
been
yoked
for
years
to
such
a
morally
frail
specimen
of
womanhood
as
she
conceived
the
first
allan
to
have
been
so
allan
letter
of
refusal
to
help
edgar
escape
the
life
that
was
growing
more
and
more
irksome
to
him
was
as
decided
as
it
was
brief
but
edgar
was
unshaken
in
his
resolve
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
meantime
finding
no
outlet
for
his
restless
creative
faculty
that
would
not
remain
inactive
though
there
was
no
opportunity
for
its
satisfaction
he
gave
himself
over
by
turns
to
deepest
dejection
and
wildest
hilarity
finally
as
no
other
relief
was
at
hand
he
decided
to
force
his
discharge
by
deliberate
and
systematic
neglect
of
the
rules
the
plan
succeeded
so
well
that
before
the
session
was
out
he
was
expelled
from
the
academy
for
disobedience
of
orders
and
failure
to
attend
classes
and
chapter
xvii
happily
the
restraints
of
the
academy
and
his
environment
there
instead
of
crushing
out
young
edgar
impulse
to
dream
and
to
put
his
dreams
into
writing
as
a
longer
period
of
the
same
restraints
and
conditions
might
have
done
had
but
quickened
and
strengthened
these
very
impulses
and
he
had
now
but
one
wish
one
aspiration
in
regard
to
his
newly
acquired
freedom
and
that
was
to
dedicate
it
to
the
art
of
literature
which
had
become
more
and
more
his
passion
and
his
mistress
and
which
since
he
had
given
up
all
idea
of
the
army
he
was
resolved
to
make
his
sole
profession
his
first
step
toward
this
end
was
to
arrange
before
leaving
new
york
for
a
new
edition
of
his
already
published
work
adding
some
hitherto
unpublished
poems
which
even
in
the
unsympathetic
atmosphere
of
number
south
barracks
had
been
undergoing
a
refining
process
in
the
seething
crucible
of
his
brain
the
money
for
this
venture
dropped
into
his
lap
as
it
were
for
when
the
new
friends
in
whom
he
had
confided
passed
the
word
around
that
the
bard
was
going
to
get
out
a
book
of
poetry
the
cadets
in
anticipation
of
a
collection
of
ditties
cleverly
hitting
off
the
peculiarities
and
characteristics
of
the
professors
to
a
man
subscribed
in
advance
at
cents
per
copy
in
appreciation
of
their
recognition
of
his
genius
and
little
guessing
what
manner
of
book
they
expected
it
to
be
the
bard
gratefully
dedicated
the
new
volume
to
the
united
states
corps
of
cadets
happy
it
was
for
him
that
he
was
not
present
to
hear
those
he
had
thus
honored
set
up
their
throats
in
unanimous
expressions
of
disgust
when
the
dedication
leaf
turned
they
were
confronted
by
a
reprint
of
tamerlane
and
al
aaraaf
with
the
shorter
poems
to
helen
a
pæan
israfel
and
other
rubbish
as
they
promptly
pronounced
the
entire
contents
of
the
book
listen
fellows
said
one
of
the
disgusted
lot
with
the
open
volume
in
his
hand
heaven
a
spirit
doth
dwell
whose
heartstrings
are
a
lute
none
sing
so
wildly
well
as
the
angel
israfel
and
the
giddy
stars
so
legends
tell
ceasing
their
hymns
attend
the
spell
of
his
voice
all
mute
as
he
finished
this
opening
stanza
of
what
posterity
has
ranked
as
one
of
the
most
exquisite
lyrics
in
the
english
tongue
but
which
was
received
by
the
audience
of
cadets
with
guffaws
of
derision
the
reader
closed
the
book
with
a
snap
and
dashed
it
across
the
room
and
into
the
open
fire
did
you
ever
hear
crazier
rubbish
he
asked
with
contempt
highway
robbery
i
call
it
to
send
us
such
stuff
for
our
good
hard
cash
the
joke
on
us
this
time
and
no
doubt
about
it
said
the
also
chagrinned
but
more
philosophically
inclined
gibs
the
bard
means
well
though
and
no
doubt
he
thinks
the
stuff
is
poetry
old
solemnly
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
something
wrong
here
he
remarked
ominously
i
suspected
it
all
along
the
business
of
getting
his
book
published
dispatched
the
thoughts
turned
lovingly
toward
richmond
which
he
still
called
home
and
in
hand
and
a
package
of
copies
of
his
book
which
he
intended
as
presents
to
his
old
chums
under
his
arm
he
set
out
upon
the
journey
thither
the
streets
of
new
york
had
been
cold
and
bleak
but
he
told
himself
as
he
journeyed
that
april
days
at
home
were
quite
different
the
grass
would
be
already
green
upon
the
hillsides
many
of
the
trees
in
leaf
and
the
dear
spring
flowers
in
bloom
he
pictured
the
ample
comforts
of
the
allan
homestead
and
of
his
own
room
in
it
with
its
familiar
furnishings
of
course
he
had
no
idea
of
looking
to
allan
for
support
his
pen
must
give
him
that
now
but
during
the
visit
which
he
was
going
to
make
at
home
it
would
be
pleasant
to
sleep
once
more
in
that
room
with
all
of
its
associations
though
many
of
these
were
with
the
blunders
of
a
blinded
youth
as
he
thought
of
allan
and
his
last
meeting
with
him
his
heart
softened
he
would
try
and
keep
their
intercourse
upon
the
friendly
basis
upon
which
his
last
sad
visit
home
had
placed
it
would
as
far
as
possible
put
himself
in
his
place
and
see
things
as
he
saw
them
how
desolate
the
widowed
man
had
seemed
in
the
big
empty
house
during
those
chill
february
days
no
wonder
he
had
sought
escape
from
his
desolation
in
another
marriage
his
loneliness
without
the
lovely
little
mother
must
have
been
unbearable
what
was
the
new
wife
like
he
wondered
was
she
like
the
lady
of
the
manor
he
remembered
could
there
be
another
such
gentle
tender
woman
on
earth
in
his
unworldly
unpractical
dreamer
soul
it
did
not
occur
to
him
for
one
moment
that
her
existence
might
make
him
any
less
adopted
son
or
even
that
with
all
the
rooms
in
the
big
house
at
her
disposal
she
might
have
taken
a
fancy
to
rearrange
the
one
which
from
the
time
the
house
became
allan
property
had
been
eddie
room
and
which
had
so
long
stood
ready
for
his
occupancy
dedicated
as
it
was
to
his
own
belongings
at
last
he
was
on
the
sacred
soil
how
fair
and
comfortable
the
old
homestead
looked
in
its
setting
of
greening
lawn
and
flowering
garden
with
the
pleasant
sunshine
of
the
april
afternoon
over
all
how
cheerful
how
ample
how
homelike
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
commodious
front
porch
and
was
on
the
point
of
opening
the
door
when
some
impulse
he
could
not
define
made
him
pause
and
instead
of
turning
the
knob
announce
himself
with
a
rap
upon
the
shining
brass
knocker
one
of
the
old
family
servants
whom
he
had
known
and
loved
from
his
infancy
and
with
whom
he
had
always
been
a
pet
opened
the
door
and
with
beaming
face
and
eager
voice
greeted
him
with
the
enthusiastic
hospitality
of
his
kind
lifting
up
his
voice
and
his
hands
in
praise
to
god
that
he
was
once
more
in
this
world
permitted
to
look
upon
the
face
of
marse
eddie
the
whilom
young
master
of
the
house
was
equally
if
less
picturesquely
warm
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure
at
seeing
the
old
man
again
and
gave
him
his
with
instructions
to
take
it
to
his
room
and
to
tell
allan
that
he
was
there
the
venerable
darkey
face
fell
the
new
mistis
had
changed
the
house
around
some
he
explained
apologetically
and
marse
eddie
things
had
been
moved
to
one
of
the
servants
rooms
but
marse
eddie
old
room
was
a
guest
chamber
and
he
reckoned
that
would
be
the
place
to
take
the
bag
the
visitor
whole
manner
changed
at
once
the
flush
of
pleasure
died
out
of
his
face
and
left
it
pale
cold
and
stern
a
fierce
and
unreasonable
rage
possessed
him
had
dismantled
the
room
that
his
little
mother
had
arranged
for
him
and
sent
his
things
to
a
servant
room
was
this
insult
intentional
he
wondered
to
his
mind
his
little
mother
was
so
entirely
the
presiding
genius
of
the
place
he
could
not
realize
the
right
of
anyone
not
even
a
new
mistis
to
come
in
and
change
the
house
around
cut
to
the
quick
he
directed
the
old
butler
to
leave
the
bag
where
it
was
and
to
let
allan
know
that
he
was
in
the
no
announcement
could
have
given
that
lady
greater
surprise
she
regarded
edgar
leaving
west
point
after
her
husband
letter
as
direct
disobedience
and
his
presenting
himself
at
her
door
as
the
height
of
impertinence
something
of
this
was
in
the
frigid
dignity
with
which
she
received
him
standing
and
drawn
up
to
the
full
height
of
her
imposing
figure
she
had
never
been
within
speaking
distance
of
anyone
drunk
to
the
point
of
intoxication
but
somehow
she
had
received
an
impression
that
this
was
pretty
generally
the
case
with
the
young
man
now
before
her
and
when
he
began
somewhat
incoherently
in
his
foolish
rage
to
ask
her
confirmation
of
the
old
servant
statement
that
his
room
had
been
dismantled
she
was
convinced
that
it
was
his
condition
at
the
moment
turning
with
the
grand
air
for
which
she
was
noted
to
the
hoary
butler
who
stood
in
the
doorway
between
and
hall
respectfully
awaiting
orders
as
to
marse
eddie
bag
she
said
put
this
drunken
man
out
of
the
house
the
aged
slave
stood
aghast
between
the
stately
new
mistress
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
serve
and
the
beloved
young
master
whose
had
warmed
his
old
heart
what
should
he
do
he
stood
in
silence
his
lined
black
face
filled
with
sadness
his
chin
in
his
hand
his
eyes
bent
in
sorrow
and
shame
upon
the
floor
what
should
he
do
fortunately
the
new
mistress
did
not
see
his
indecision
as
she
swept
from
the
room
and
marse
eddie
quickly
relieved
him
of
the
embarrassing
dilemma
by
picking
up
the
and
passing
out
of
the
door
closing
it
behind
him
it
was
all
a
mistake
a
miserable
mistake
but
one
of
those
mistakes
in
understanding
between
blind
prejudiced
human
beings
by
which
hearts
are
broken
souls
lost
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
edgar
poe
paused
and
looked
back
at
the
massive
closed
door
it
seem
to
say
to
while
he
had
been
inside
the
house
one
of
those
sudden
changes
in
the
face
of
nature
of
which
his
superstitious
soul
always
made
note
had
taken
place
a
shower
from
a
passing
cloud
had
filled
the
depressions
in
the
uneven
pavement
where
before
only
sunshine
lay
with
little
pools
of
water
and
had
left
the
trees
weeping
as
he
fancifully
described
them
to
himself
he
walked
along
the
wet
streets
for
a
few
steps
by
the
side
of
the
wall
that
enclosed
house
and
grounds
then
he
paused
again
and
looked
over
into
the
dripping
garden
while
he
held
consultation
with
himself
as
to
what
he
should
do
next
as
he
looked
the
breath
of
drenched
violets
greeted
his
nostrels
he
noticed
that
the
lilacs
were
coming
into
blossom
the
fruit
trees
already
stood
like
brides
veiled
in
their
fresh
bloom
the
tulip
and
hyacinth
and
daffodil
beds
were
gay
with
color
how
their
newly
washed
faces
shone
in
the
sunshine
just
then
bursting
through
the
clouds
near
him
just
inside
the
wall
was
a
bed
of
he
was
seized
with
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
go
down
upon
his
knees
by
it
and
search
among
the
glistening
green
leaves
to
see
if
the
lilies
were
in
bloom
but
the
like
the
house
door
was
closed
upon
him
and
seemed
to
repeat
the
fateful
word
nevermore
whither
should
he
turn
his
steps
to
allan
office
never
his
intention
had
been
to
submit
himself
to
allan
as
far
as
his
would
let
him
to
consult
him
in
regard
to
the
literary
career
he
felt
himself
committed
to
now
that
as
he
recalled
with
satisfaction
the
bridges
between
him
and
any
other
profession
were
burnt
behind
him
his
own
plan
upon
which
he
was
resolved
to
ask
allan
opinion
would
be
to
seek
a
position
in
the
line
of
journalism
which
would
give
him
a
living
while
he
was
waiting
for
his
more
ambitious
work
to
find
buyers
but
since
the
interview
with
allan
he
realized
the
folly
of
this
dream
then
whither
should
he
go
to
the
chums
of
his
boyhood
rob
stanard
dick
ambler
rob
sully
jack
preston
where
were
they
good
dear
friends
they
had
been
but
it
seemed
so
long
since
they
had
played
together
what
should
they
find
to
say
to
each
other
now
they
were
busy
with
their
various
avocations
and
interests
what
room
in
their
hearts
and
homes
could
there
be
for
a
wanderer
like
himself
at
the
age
of
one
and
twenty
at
the
springtime
of
his
life
as
of
the
year
he
felt
himself
to
be
as
friendless
as
much
a
stranger
in
the
city
which
he
called
home
as
rip
van
winkle
after
his
long
sleep
had
felt
in
his
the
only
spots
toward
which
he
could
turn
with
any
confidence
for
sympathy
were
those
two
quiet
cities
within
this
city
where
lay
his
loved
and
lovely
dead
the
doubly
dead
in
that
they
died
so
young
how
different
my
life
would
be
if
they
had
lived
he
murmured
to
the
flowers
yet
how
fair
was
this
world
in
which
he
had
no
place
even
to
a
mere
how
fair
was
this
mansion
in
its
setting
of
april
green
and
bloom
which
had
once
owned
him
as
its
young
its
future
master
above
it
hope
stretched
her
shining
wings
but
the
hope
was
not
for
him
for
him
the
closed
door
and
the
closed
gate
said
only
no
more
nevermore
but
whither
should
he
go
whither
as
he
turned
from
the
garden
and
walked
slowly
aimlessly
down
the
street
his
great
grey
eyes
fixed
ponderingly
upon
the
breaking
clouds
a
rainbow
bright
symbol
of
promise
spanned
the
heavens
his
eyes
widened
his
lips
parted
at
the
wonder
and
the
beauty
and
the
suddenness
of
it
whither
should
he
go
behold
an
answer
meet
for
a
poet
whither
whither
the
dark
eyes
in
the
pale
cameo
face
turned
skyward
the
eyes
of
him
who
had
declared
himself
to
be
a
deep
worshipper
of
all
beauty
grew
more
dreamy
whither
indeed
but
to
the
end
of
the
rainbow
by
what
path
obscure
and
lonely
the
quest
would
lead
him
he
knew
not
but
he
would
follow
it
to
the
bitter
end
for
there
perchance
he
would
find
if
not
the
traditional
pot
of
gold
at
least
a
wreath
of
laurel
as
he
wandered
down
the
street
his
eyes
still
upon
the
bow
his
dream
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
hearty
voice
of
one
of
his
friends
and
his
sister
rosalie
adopted
brother
jack
mackenzie
hello
edgar
he
cried
did
you
drop
from
the
clouds
evidently
for
i
see
your
head
is
still
in
them
he
returned
the
greeting
with
joy
how
good
it
was
to
feel
the
of
friendship
and
welcome
he
had
always
liked
jack
for
the
moment
he
loved
him
and
where
are
you
bound
you
and
your
bag
asked
jack
not
to
allan
for
you
are
going
in
the
wrong
direction
no
replied
the
dreamer
with
a
whimsical
smile
i
was
going
there
but
i
found
the
door
shut
so
i
changed
my
mind
and
had
just
decided
to
make
the
end
of
the
rainbow
my
destination
jack
spontaneous
laugh
rang
out
the
same
old
edgar
he
said
well
i
wo
interfere
with
your
journey
except
to
defer
it
a
bit
you
are
going
home
with
me
to
lodge

to
supper
and
spend
the
night
and
to
stay

much
longer
as
pleases
you
rose
and
the
rest
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
chapter
xviii
where
was
edgar
poe
again
the
question
was
being
asked
in
many
quarters
and
with
varying
degrees
of
interest
it
was
repeated
but
it
still
remained
unanswered
in
richmond
it
was
asked
by
the
chums
of
his
youth
as
they
sat
under
their
comfortable
vines
and
or
stopped
each
other
on
a
corner
for
a
few
moments
social
chat
or
catching
some
one
of
the
rumors
that
were
afloat
concerning
the
gifted
companion
of
their
golden
days
looked
up
from
their
desks
in
office
or
to
ask
each
other
the
question
their
faces
were
keen
with
interest
for
their
admiration
and
affection
for
the
dreamer
had
been
sincere
yet
it
was
not
strong
enough
after
the
lapse
of
years
to
make
any
one
of
them
lay
down
work
and
go
forth
to
seek
a
solution
of
the
mystery
such
an
errand
not
one
of
them
felt
to
be
his
business
a
quixotic
errand
it
would
indeed
have
been
considered
and
one
which
if
half
the
rumors
were
true
might
have
necessitated
a
journey
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
prove
but
a
errand
after
all
the
question
was
one
with
which
john
allan
little
concerned
himself
a
robust
son
and
heir
had
come
in
his
late
middle
age
to
fill
all
his
thoughts
with
new
interest
and
plans
for
the
present
and
the
future
the
patter
of
little
feet
of
his
own
child
on
the
stairs
and
halls
of
his
home
drowned
the
ghostly
memories
of
other
and
less
welcome
footfalls
that
had
once
echoed
there
he
too
had
heard
rumors
of
the
adventures
and
the
misadventures
of
edgar
poe
but
he
did
not
consider
it
his
business
as
it
was
certainly
not
his
pleasure
to
investigate
them
in
baltimore
too
the
question
was
asked
by
the
kinsfolk
whose
acquaintance
edgar
had
made
during
his
visit
there
but
they
had
never
held
themselves
in
the
least
responsible
for
this
eccentric
son
of
their
brother
david
the
actor
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
surely
it
was
none
of
business
to
follow
him
upon
any
chase
his
foolish
fancy
might
lead
him
but
still
when
the
rumors
that
were
rife
reached
their
ears
it
was
with
no
small
degree
of
curiosity
that
they
asked
each
other
the
question
where
was
edgar
poe
what
had
become
of
him
had
he
as
some
believed
met
death
upon
the
high
seas
or
in
a
foreign
land
was
he
the
real
hero
of
stories
of
adventure
which
floated
across
the
ocean
from
russia
from
france
from
greece
he
had
certainly
contemplated
going
abroad
the
superintendent
of
west
point
academy
had
had
a
letter
from
him
sometime
after
he
left
there
declaring
his
intention
of
seeking
an
appointment
in
the
polish
army
had
he
gone
or
was
he
as
some
would
have
it
going
in
and
out
among
them
there
in
baltimore
but
unknown
and
unrecognized
his
identity
hidden
under
assumed
name
and
ingenious
disguise
who
could
tell
the
wonder
of
it
was
not
in
the
existence
of
the
unanswered
question
of
the
mystery
but
that
the
question
could
remain
unanswered
the
mystery
remain
unsolved
and
no
attempt
be
made
to
lift
the
veil
that
a
young
man
a
gentleman
of
prominent
connections
of
handsome
features
and
distinguished
bearing
and
address
of
rare
mental
gifts
and
cultivation
and
of
magnetic
personality
could
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
could
almost
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
fellows
step
from
the
glare
of
the
world
in
which
he
moved
into
the
abyss
of
absolute
obscurity
or
impenetrable
mystery
and
create
no
stir
that
no
one
should
deem
it
his
or
her
business
to
seek
or
to
find
an
answer
to
the
question
a
reading
of
the
riddle
not
until
two
years
after
edgar
poe
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
closed
door
of
the
allan
mansion
in
richmond
and
stepped
as
it
seemed
from
the
edge
of
a
world
in
which
he
was
not
wanted
into
the
unknown
did
such
an
one
arise
and
that
one
was
as
an
especially
good
friend
of
edgar
poe
was
most
likely
to
be
a
woman
between
this
woman
maria
poe
clemm
a
widow
of
middle
age
and
the
dreamer
there
existed
the
close
of
aunt
and
nephew
for
she
was
the
own
sister
of
his
father
david
poe
more
than
that
there
existed
though
they
had
never
seen
each
other
a
soul
kinship
rare
between
persons
of
the
same
blood
and
which
for
all
they
had
never
seen
each
other
she
with
the
woman
unerring
instinct
that
sometimes
seems
akin
to
inspiration
divined
she
too
was
something
of
a
dreamer
with
an
ear
for
the
voices
of
nature
and
a
mind
open
to
the
influences
of
its
beauty
but
with
a
goodly
ballast
of
strong
common
sense
she
was
but
a
young
girl
when
her
handsome
and
idolized
brother
david
scandalized
the
family
by
marrying
an
actress
and
himself
taking
to
the
stage
but
she
had
seen
the
bewitching
miss
arnold
at
the
theatre
in
baltimore
had
with
fascinated
eyes
followed
her
twinkling
feet
through
the
mazy
dance
had
listened
with
charmed
ears
to
her
exquisite
voice
had
sat
under
her
acting
to
her
childish
mind
the
stage
had
become
a
and
miss
arnold
its
presiding
genius
that
brother
david
should
love
and
marry
her
seemed
like
something
out
of
a
fairy
book
did
not
blame
brother
david
she
secretly
entirely
approved
of
him
in
her
later
years
the
death
of
the
husband
of
her
own
youth
who
had
been
romantically
passionately
loved
had
left
her
penniless
but
not
disillusioned
with
her
own
living
to
get
and
a
little
daughter
with
a
face
like
a
luca
della
robbia
chorister
and
a
voice
that
went
with
the
face
but
who
had
the
requirements
of
other
flesh
and
blood
children
to
be
provided
for
this
child
was
the
sunshine
of
the
lonely
widow
life
yet
she
only
in
part
filled
the
great
mother
heart
of
her
nature
had
made
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
son
as
well
as
a
daughter
then
mockingly
it
would
seem
denied
her
but
in
her
dreams
she
worshipped
the
son
she
had
never
borne
and
deep
in
her
heart
was
stored
like
unshed
tears
the
love
she
would
have
lavished
upon
him
had
her
whole
mission
in
life
been
fulfilled
she
had
heard
little
of
her
brother
david
son
edgar
but
that
little
had
always
interested
her
she
was
living
away
from
baltimore
during
his
visit
there
just
before
he
entered
west
point
and
so
she
did
not
meet
him
but
upon
the
death
of
her
husband
soon
afterward
she
had
returned
to
the
home
of
her
girlhood
and
established
herself
in
modest
but
respectable
quarters
to
earn
a
livelihood
for
the
little
virginia
and
herself
by
the
use
of
her
skillful
needle
it
was
soon
afterward
that
with
a
concern
which
no
one
but
herself
had
felt
she
learned
of
the
mystery
surrounding
the
whereabouts
of
her
nephew
she
yearned
over
the
wanderer
and
longed
to
mother
him
as
somehow
she
knew
he
needed
to
be
mothered
she
kept
near
her
a
copy
of
his
last
little
book
of
poems
which
she
had
read
again
and
again
in
the
earlier
ones
she
saw
a
loose
handful
of
jewels
in
the
rough
yet
she
recognized
the
sparkle
which
distinguishes
the
genuine
from
the
false
in
the
later
ones
she
perceived
gems
of
purest
ray
serene
polished
and
strung
and
ready
to
be
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
priceless
she
was
a
tall
woman
and
with
large
but
and
strong
features
and
handsome
deepset
gray
eyes
which
habitually
wore
the
expression
of
one
who
has
loved
much
and
sorrowed
much
she
had
been
called
stately
before
her
proud
spirit
had
bowed
itself
in
submission
to
the
chastenings
of
grief
since
when
she
had
borne
the
seal
of
meekness
but
there
was
a
distinction
about
her
that
neither
grief
nor
poverty
could
destroy
she
was
so
unmistakably
the
in
the
simple
but
dainty
white
cap
with
its
floating
strings
which
modestly
covered
her
dark
waving
hair
the
plain
black
dress
and
prim
collar
fastened
with
its
mourning
pin
she
made
a
reposeful
picture
of
the
conception
of
a
widow
indeed
her
hands
were
not
her
least
striking
feature
they
were
large
but
perfectly
modelled
and
they
were
deft
capable
full
of
character
and
feeling
in
their
touch
there
was
a
wonderfully
soothing
quality
in
winter
they
always
possessed
just
the
pleasantest
degree
of
warmth
in
summer
just
the
most
grateful
degree
of
coolness
no
one
ever
received
a
greeting
from
them
without
being
impressed
with
the
friendliness
the
sympathy
of
their
clasp
as
she
bent
her
fine
face
over
them
and
the
work
they
held
while
the
little
virginia
sat
nursing
a
doll
at
her
feet
she
often
stitched
into
the
garments
that
they
fashioned
yearnings
thoughts
questionings
of
the
youth
her
brother
child
whose
picture
as
she
had
conceived
him
from
descriptions
she
had
heard
she
carried
in
her
heart
she
knew
too
well
the
weakness
that
was
his
inheritance
and
she
knew
too
what
perils
were
in
waiting
to
ensnare
the
feet
of
untried
youth
poor
homeless
and
without
the
restraining
influences
of
friends
and
kindred
whatever
their
inheritance
might
be
sometimes
she
felt
that
the
yearning
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
and
that
she
must
arise
and
go
forth
and
seek
this
straying
sheep
of
the
fold
of
poe
but
alas
she
was
but
a
woman
without
money
and
without
a
clue
upon
which
to
begin
to
work
save
such
as
wild
improbable
and
contradictory
rumors
afforded
that
was
after
all
what
she
most
needed
a
clue
if
she
could
only
find
a
clue
poor
as
she
was
she
would
follow
it
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
upon
a
summer
day
two
years
after
edgar
disappearance
and
when
she
had
almost
given
up
hope
the
clue
came
it
was
placed
in
her
hand
by
her
cousin
and
edgar
neilson
poe
who
had
no
faith
in
its
value
but
passed
it
on
to
her
as
it
had
come
to
him
for
what
it
was
worth
as
he
expressed
it
it
was
a
strange
story
that
clemm
cousin
neilson
told
her
and
which
had
been
told
him
he
said
by
an
acquaintance
of
his
from
richmond
who
had
known
edgar
poe
in
his
boyhood
it
seems
that
this
richmond
man
had
during
a
visit
to
baltimore
gone
to
a
brickyard
to
arrange
for
the
shipment
home
of
bricks
for
a
new
house
he
was
building
as
he
sat
in
the
office
talking
to
the
manager
of
the
yard
a
line
of
men
bearing
freshly
molded
bricks
to
the
kiln
passed
the
open
window
there
was
something
about
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
laborers
that
struck
the
richmond
man
as
familiar
and
he
turned
quickly
to
the
manager
and
asked
the
name
of
the
man
pointing
him
out
the
name
given
him
was
a
strange
one
to
him
and
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
thoughts
and
returned
to
his
business
talk
upon
his
way
to
his
hotel
however
the
appearance
of
the
and
the
impression
that
somewhere
he
had
seen
him
before
returned
to
his
mind
and
it
came
upon
him
in
a
flash
first
that
the
likeness
was
to
edgar
poe
and
then
the
conviction
that
the
man
was
none
other
than
poe
himself
though
emaciated
and
aged
to
a
degree
that
with
his
shabby
dress
and
unshaven
chin
made
him
scarcely
recognizable
though
he
had
been
but
a
casual
acquaintance
of
edgar
he
was
deeply
touched
at
seeing
him
so
evidently
in
distress
and
returned
to
the
brickyard
early
the
next
morning
for
the
purpose
of
speaking
to
him
and
of
helping
him
back
into
the
sphere
in
which
he
belonged
and
from
which
he
had
so
long
disappeared
but
the
man
he
sought
was
not
there
and
no
one
knew
where
his
lodgings
were
he
was
a
recent
employe
of
the
yard
they
said
and
so
gloomy
and
unsociable
that
he
had
made
no
friends
he
was
capable
of
a
great
amount
of
work
which
he
performed
faithfully
but
kept
to
himself
and
had
little
to
say
to
anybody
upon
the
day
before
he
had
looked
ill
and
had
stopped
work
before
the
day
was
over
he
was
evidently
suffering
from
exhaustion
but
had
declared
that
he
needed
nothing
and
after
sitting
down
to
rest
upon
a
pile
of
bricks
for
a
while
had
gone
off
to
his
home
wherever
that
might
be
as
usual
alone
this
story
neilson
poe
set
down
as
highly
sensational
he
did
not
believe
he
said
with
a
laugh
that
his
cousin
when
found
would
be
doing
anything
half
so
energetic
or
useful
as
carrying
bricks
he
would
have
more
hope
of
him
if
he
could
believe
it
the
laborer
real
or
fancied
likeness
to
edgar
was
but
a
case
of
chance
resemblance
that
was
all
but
that
was
not
enough
for
maria
clemm
she
folded
her
sewing
and
laid
it
away
with
an
air
of
finality
which
plainly
said
that
she
had
found
other
and
more
pressing
work
to
do
the
sewing
must
wait
a
more
convenient
season
then
she
went
out
into
the
streets
sweltering
in
the
summer
heat
and
turned
her
face
toward
that
obscure
quarter
of
the
town
where
human
beings
who
could
not
afford
to
rest
or
to
dine
might
at
least
secure
a
corner
in
which
to
lodge
and
the
right
if
not
the
appetite
to
eat
for
an
infinitesimal
sum
for
it
was
in
this
quarter
that
strange
as
it
might
seem
her
instinct
told
her
her
search
must
be
made
in
this
quarter
that
edgar
poe
the
rich
merchant
pampered
edgar
poe
the
poet
the
scholar
the
exquisite
in
dress
in
taste
and
in
manners
would
be
found
when
she
did
find
him
the
mystery
that
had
surrounded
him
was
stripped
of
the
last
shred
of
its
romance
in
a
room
compared
to
which
the
little
chamber
back
of
the
shop
of
fipps
the
milliner
in
which
his
mother
had
drawn
her
last
breath
and
in
which
frances
allan
had
found
and
fallen
in
love
with
him
was
luxurious
he
lay
upon
a
bed
of
straw
thrown
into
a
dark
corner
tossing
with
fever
and
in
his
delirium
literally
babbling
of
green
fields
the
but
ignorant
and
uncleanly
slattern
who
sought
with
lodgings
to
let
to
keep
the
souls
of
herself
and
family
in
their
bodies
gave
him
as
much
attention
as
the
demands
of
a
numerous
brood
of
little
slatterns
and
a
drunken
husband
would
permit
and
sighed
with
real
sorrow
as
she
admitted
that
the
poor
gentleman
was
in
a
very
bad
way
it
was
her
opinion
he
had
seen
better
days
she
confided
to
the
three
other
lodgers
who
were
just
then
renting
the
three
straw
beds
in
the
three
other
corners
of
the
same
dark
squalid
and
room
he
was
so
and
if
he
poor
as
a
church
mouse
pity
he
had
no
folks
nor
nobody
to
keer
nothin
about
it
was
not
at
once
that
clemm
found
him
she
had
sought
him
diligently
in
what
would
be
known
as
the
slum
districts
of
the
city
descending
the
scale
of
respectability
lower
and
lower
until
she
thought
she
had
reached
the
bottom
but
without
success
then
upon
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
of
her
search
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
little
virginia
was
watching
anxiously
from
the
window
for
muddie
return
a
wagon
stopped
before
her
door
and
out
of
it
and
into
the
house
was
borne
a
stretcher
upon
which
lay
an
apparently
dying
man
ghastly
unshaven
and
muttering
broken
unintelligible
sentences
keeping
pace
with
the
wagon
as
it
crept
along
the
street
might
have
been
seen
the
stately
widow
clemm
when
the
wagon
stopped
she
stopped
and
directed
the
careful
lifting
of
the
stretcher
from
it
then
she
turned
and
opened
the
door
of
her
small
house
and
led
the
way
to
her
neat
where
upon
her
own
immaculate
bed
the
sick
man
was
gently
laid
henceforth
as
long
as
need
be
a
cot
in
the
would
be
good
enough
for
her
the
little
virginia
her
soft
eyes
filled
with
wonder
had
followed
her
mother
upon
who
is
it
muddie
she
questioned
in
an
awed
whisper
the
anxiety
in
the
widow
face
gave
place
to
a
look
of
exaltation
which
fairly
transfigured
her
her
deep
eyes
shone
with
the
hoarded
love
for
the
son
so
long
denied
her
she
gathered
her
little
daughter
to
her
breast
and
kissed
her
tenderly
it
is
your
brother
darling
she
gently
said
god
has
given
me
a
son
well
she
knew
that
he
was
not
yet
entirely
her
own
that
she
would
have
to
wrestle
fiercely
with
death
for
his
possession
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
win
the
battle
death
not
have
him
she
passionately
told
herself
but
the
next
moment
overwhelmed
with
a
realization
of
human
helplessness
she
was
upon
her
knees
at
his
bedside
crying
oh
god
do
not
let
him
die
i
have
but
just
found
him
spare
him
to
me
now
if
but
a
little
while
chapter
xix
for
many
days
the
sick
man
lay
with
eyes
closed
in
uneasy
sleep
or
open
but
unseeing
and
with
body
writhing
and
tongue
loosed
but
incoherent
showing
that
these
hours
as
well
as
the
sleeping
ones
were
horror
haunted
finally
the
most
terrible
of
dreams
visited
him
the
circumstances
of
his
life
had
caused
him
from
his
infancy
to
dwell
much
upon
the
subject
of
death
he
had
oftentimes
taken
a
gruesome
pleasure
in
trying
to
imagine
all
the
sensations
of
the
grim
passage
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
even
to
the
closing
of
the
and
the
descent
into
the
grave
now
in
his
the
dreadful
details
and
sensations
imagined
in
health
came
to
him
but
with
tenfold
vividness
at
the
point
when
in
the
blackness
and
suffocation
of
conscious
burial
horror
had
reached
its
extremest
limit
and
the
sufferer
was
upon
the
verge
of
real
death
from
sheer
terror
relief
came
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
freed
from
the
closeness
the
maddening
fight
for
breath
of
the
coffin
and
gently
surely
borne
upward
out
of
the
abyss
upward
upward
into
air
light
life
for
a
long
while
he
lay
quite
still
too
exhausted
to
move
hand
or
foot
to
raise
his
eyelids
even
but
content
more
happy
perfectly
happy
in
the
glorious
consciousness
of
being
able
just
to
lie
still
and
breathe
the
sweet
air
of
day
presently
as
he
began
to
feel
rested
the
great
grey
eyes
opened
for
the
first
time
since
the
conqueror
fever
had
overthrown
him
and
bound
him
to
the
uneasy
bed
of
straw
they
were
clear
as
the
sky
after
a
storm
swept
clean
of
every
cloud
but
their
lucid
depths
were
filled
with
surprise
for
they
opened
upon
a
cool
light
homelike
chamber
the
walls
around
him
were
white
but
were
relieved
here
and
there
by
restful
prints
in
narrow
black
frames
the
bed
upon
which
he
lay
was
canopied
and
the
large
bright
windows
were
curtained
with
snowiest
dimity
but
the
draperies
of
both
were
drawn
and
he
could
look
out
at
the
trees
and
the
sky
now
roseate
with
the
hues
of
evening
in
a
set
of
shelves
that
nearly
reached
the
ceiling
stood
row
on
row
of
friendly
looking
books
upon
a
high
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
with
its
polished
brass
trimmings
and
little
swinging
stood
a
white
and
gold
porcelain
vase
filled
with
asters
purple
white
and
pink
while
before
it
in
a
deep
a
little
girl
of
ten
or
eleven
years
with
a
face
like
a
luca
della
robbia
chorister
or
like
one
of
the
children
of
sunny
italy
that
served
for
old
luca
model
was
curled
up
stroking
a
large
white
cat
which
lay
purring
in
her
lap
upon
the
child
the
wondering
eyes
of
the
sick
man
lingered
longest
and
to
her
they
returned
when
their
survey
of
the
rest
of
the
room
was
done
suddenly
impelled
by
the
steadiness
of
his
gaze
she
lifted
her
own
dark
soft
eyes
and
let
them
rest
for
a
moment
upon
his
she
started
then
was
up
and
across
the
floor
in
a
flash
carrying
the
cat
upon
her
shoulder
muddie
muddie
she
cried
from
the
door
the
new
buddie
is
awake
then
still
carrying
her
pet
she
walked
to
his
bedside
and
gazed
earnestly
and
unabashed
into
the
new
buddie
face
her
eyes
had
the
velvety
softness
of
pansy
petals
and
as
they
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
sick
man
recalled
to
his
clearing
mind
the
expression
of
mixed
love
and
questioning
in
the
eyes
of
his
spaniel
comrade
the
faithful
friend
of
his
boyhood
at
length
he
spoke
who
is
she
my
mother
and
you
are
my
new
brother
that
has
come
to
live
with
us
always
a
radiant
smile
illumined
the
pale
and
haggard
face
thank
heaven
for
that
he
said
and
who
brought
me
up
out
of
the
grave
the
child
was
spared
the
necessity
of
puzzling
over
this
startling
question
it
was
no
other
than
he
thought
she
who
at
this
moment
appeared
at
the
open
door
the
tall
figure
of
a
woman
or
angel
who
in
the
next
moment
was
kneeling
beside
him
with
a
heaven
of
protecting
love
in
her
face
it
was
no
other
through
all
of
his
dreams
he
had
been
dimly
conscious
of
her
saving
him
from
death
and
despair
now
for
the
first
time
in
the
light
of
life
and
in
his
new
consciousness
he
saw
her
plainly
edgar
poe
convalescence
was
slow
but
it
was
steady
and
even
in
his
weakness
he
felt
a
peace
and
happiness
such
as
he
had
rarely
tasted
this
frugal
but
restful
home
in
which
he
found
himself
with
the
ministrations
of
muddie
and
sissy
as
he
playfully
called
his
aunt
and
the
little
cousin
who
had
adopted
him
as
her
buddie
were
to
him
after
his
struggle
with
hunger
fever
and
death
like
a
safe
harbor
to
a
sailor
the
little
virginia
claimed
him
as
her
own
from
the
beginning
as
long
as
he
was
weak
enough
to
need
to
be
waited
upon
her
small
feet
and
hands
never
wearied
in
his
service
but
as
he
grew
better
it
was
he
who
served
her
there
never
were
such
stories
as
he
could
tell
such
games
as
he
could
play
and
he
took
her
cat
to
his
heart
with
gratifying
promptness
when
they
walked
out
together
the
world
seemed
turned
into
a
fairyland
as
with
her
hand
held
fast
in
his
he
told
her
wonderful
secrets
about
the
clouds
the
trees
the
flowers
the
birds
and
even
about
the
stones
under
her
feet
it
was
fascinating
to
her
too
to
lie
and
listen
to
him
read
and
talk
with
muddie
she
was
not
wise
enough
to
understand
much
that
they
said
but
at
night
when
she
had
been
tucked
into
bed
he
would
sit
under
the
lamp
and
read
aloud
from
one
of
the
books
in
the
shelves
or
from
the
long
strips
of
paper
upon
which
he
wrote
and
wrote
and
though
she
did
not
understand
the
words
she
delighted
to
listen
for
his
voice
made
the
sweetest
lullaby
music
with
the
return
of
health
and
strength
energy
and
the
impulse
for
life
battle
began
to
return
to
edgar
poe
and
with
them
a
new
incentive
he
began
to
awaken
to
the
fact
that
muddie
and
sissy
were
poor
and
that
his
presence
in
their
home
was
making
them
poorer
that
the
struggle
to
support
this
modest
establishment
was
a
severe
one
and
that
he
must
arise
and
add
what
he
could
to
the
earnings
of
the
deft
needle
the
three
little
editions
of
his
poems
had
brought
him
no
money
he
had
begun
to
despair
of
their
ever
bringing
him
any
he
had
sometime
since
turned
his
attention
to
prose
but
the
manuscripts
of
such
stories
as
he
had
offered
the
publishers
had
come
back
to
him
with
unflattering
promptness
he
began
now
however
with
fresh
heart
to
write
and
to
arrange
a
number
of
those
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
his
best
for
a
book
to
which
he
proposed
to
give
the
title
tales
of
the
folio
club
but
the
new
tide
of
hope
was
soon
at
a
low
ebb
the
editors
and
publishers
would
have
none
of
his
work
when
the
repeated
return
to
him
of
the
stories
poems
and
essays
he
sent
out
had
begun
to
make
him
lose
faith
in
their
merit
and
to
question
his
own
right
to
live
since
the
world
had
no
use
for
the
only
commodity
he
was
capable
of
producing
muddie
came
in
one
evening
with
an
unusually
bright
eager
look
in
her
eyes
and
a
copy
of
saturday
a
weekly
paper
published
in
baltimore
in
her
hand
here
your
chance
eddie
she
said
in
big
capitals
upon
the
first
page
of
the
paper
was
an
announcement
to
the
effect
that
the
would
give
two
prizes
one
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
best
short
story
and
one
of
fifty
dollars
for
the
best
poem
submitted
to
it
anonymously
three
gentlemen
of
the
city
would
act
as
judges
and
the
names
of
the
successful
contestants
would
be
published
upon
the
twelfth
of
october
with
trembling
hands
the
discouraged
young
applicant
for
place
as
an
author
made
a
neat
parcel
of
six
of
his
tales
of
the
folio
club
and
a
recently
written
poem
the
coliseum
and
left
them
that
very
night
at
the
door
of
the
office
of
saturday
how
eagerly
he
and
muddie
and
sissy
awaited
the
fateful
twelfth
the
hours
and
the
days
dragged
by
on
leaden
wings
but
the
twelfth
came
at
last
it
found
edgar
poe
at
the
office
of
the
an
hour
before
time
for
the
paper
to
be
issued
but
at
length
he
held
the
scarcely
dry
sheet
in
his
hand
and
there
with
his
name
at
the
end
was
the
story
that
had
taken
the
prize
the
found
in
a
bottle
more
in
the
following
wonderful
most
wonderful
words
it
seemed
to
him
the
judges
declared
their
decision
among
the
prose
articles
were
many
of
various
and
distinguished
merit
but
the
singular
force
and
beauty
of
those
sent
by
the
author
of
of
the
folio
club
leave
us
no
room
for
hesitation
in
that
department
we
have
awarded
the
premium
to
a
tale
entitled
found
in
a
bottle
it
would
hardly
be
doing
justice
to
the
writer
of
this
collection
to
say
that
the
tale
we
have
chosen
is
the
best
of
the
six
offered
by
him
we
can
not
refrain
from
saying
that
the
author
owes
it
to
his
own
reputation
as
well
as
to
the
gratification
of
the
community
to
publish
the
entire
volume
these
tales
are
eminently
distinguished
by
a
wild
vigorous
and
poetical
imagination
a
rich
style
a
fertile
invention
and
varied
curious
learning
signed
john
kennedy
latrobe
james
miller
here
was
the
fulfilment
of
hope
long
deferred
here
was
a
brimming
cup
of
joy
which
the
widowed
aunt
and
little
cousin
who
had
taken
him
in
and
made
him
a
son
and
brother
could
share
with
him
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
yet
there
it
was
in
plain
black
and
white
with
the
signatures
of
the
three
gentlemen
whose
opinion
everyone
would
respect
at
the
end
what
wealth
that
hundred
dollars
the
first
earnings
of
his
pen
seemed
what
comforts
for
the
modest
home
it
would
buy
this
was
no
mere
nod
of
recognition
from
the
literary
world
but
a
cordial
drawing
him
safely
within
that
magic
but
hitherto
frowning
portal
he
felt
as
if
he
were
walking
on
air
as
he
hurried
home
to
tell
muddie
and
sissy
of
his
and
their
good
fortune
and
how
proud
muddie
was
of
her
boy
how
lovingly
little
sissy
hung
on
his
neck
and
gave
him
kisses
of
congratulation
though
but
little
realizing
the
significance
of
his
success
and
how
he
in
turn
beamed
upon
them
the
grey
eyes
had
lost
all
of
their
melancholy
and
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
wells
of
sunshine
in
imagination
he
pictured
these
loved
ones
raised
forever
from
want
for
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
only
sell
for
a
goodly
price
all
the
rest
of
the
tales
of
the
folio
club
but
under
the
happy
influence
of
his
success
he
would
write
many
more
and
far
better
stories
still
to
be
promptly
exchanged
for
gold
bright
and
early
monday
morning
he
made
ready
with
muddie
aid
for
a
round
of
visits
to
the
members
of
the
committee
to
thank
them
for
their
kind
words
his
clothes
hat
boots
and
gloves
were
all
somewhat
worse
for
wear
and
his
old
coat
hung
loosely
upon
his
shoulders
wasted
as
they
still
were
by
the
effects
of
his
long
illness
but
he
whistled
while
he
brushed
and
muddie
darned
and
carefully
inked
the
worn
seams
and
finally
it
was
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
quite
presentable
that
he
kissed
his
hands
to
his
two
good
angels
and
ran
gaily
down
the
steps
hope
gave
him
a
debonair
mien
that
belied
his
apparel
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
john
kennedy
prominent
lawyer
and
the
author
of
that
pleasant
book
swallow
barn
then
newly
published
and
the
talk
of
the
town
answered
a
knock
upon
his
office
door
with
a
quick
come
in
at
the
same
time
he
raised
his
eyes
and
confronted
those
of
the
young
author
whom
he
had
been
instrumental
in
raising
from
the
verge
of
despair
the
face
of
the
older
man
was
one
of
combined
strength
and
amiability
evidences
of
talent
were
there
but
combined
with
common
sense
there
was
benevolence
in
the
expansive
brow
and
kindliness
and
humor
as
well
as
character
about
the
lines
of
the
nose
and
the
wide
mouth
and
the
eyes
diffused
a
light
which
was
not
only
bright
but
genial
and
which
robbed
them
of
keenness
as
they
rested
upon
the
pathetic
and
at
the
same
time
distinguished
figure
before
him
what
the
kindly
eyes
took
in
a
glance
was
that
the
pale
and
haggard
young
stranger
with
the
big
brow
and
eyes
and
the
features
the
military
carriage
and
the
shabby
but
neat
frock
coat
buttoned
to
the
throat
where
it
met
the
fashionable
black
stock
and
with
the
modest
and
exquisite
manners
was
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
but
poor
probably
even
hungry
they
kindled
with
added
interest
when
the
visitor
introduced
himself
as
edgar
poe
the
author
of
tales
of
the
folio
club
the
strong
pleasant
face
and
the
cordial
hand
that
grasped
his
own
then
placed
a
chair
for
him
invited
the
young
author
confidence
a
confidence
that
always
responded
promptly
to
kindness
and
he
had
soon
poured
into
the
attentive
ear
of
john
kennedy
not
only
profuse
thanks
for
the
encouraging
words
in
the
but
his
whole
history
deeply
touched
by
the
young
man
refined
and
intellectual
beauty
partially
obscured
as
it
was
by
the
unmistakable
marks
of
illness
and
want
by
his
frank
confiding
manners
by
the
evidences
in
thought
and
expression
of
gifts
of
a
high
order
and
by
the
moving
story
he
told
heart
went
out
to
him
and
he
sent
him
on
his
way
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
other
members
of
the
committee
rejoicing
in
offers
of
friendship
and
hospitality
and
promises
of
aid
in
securing
publishers
for
his
writings
edgar
poe
had
been
loved
of
women
he
had
been
adored
by
small
boys
he
had
received
many
material
benefits
from
his
foster
father
he
had
been
kindly
treated
by
his
teachers
but
he
was
now
for
the
first
time
taken
by
the
hand
spiritually
as
well
as
physically
by
a
a
man
of
mental
and
moral
force
and
of
position
in
the
world
a
man
moreover
who
with
rare
divination
appreciated
out
of
his
own
strength
the
weaknesses
and
the
needs
as
well
as
the
gifts
and
graces
of
his
new
acquaintance
and
who
took
his
dreams
and
ambitions
seriously
the
sane
wholesome
companionship
which
the
dreamer
found
in
him
and
at
his
hospitable
fireside
acted
like
a
tonic
upon
his
spirits
and
improvement
in
his
health
both
of
mind
and
body
were
rapid
though
warning
him
against
being
over
much
elated
at
his
success
and
an
expectation
of
growing
suddenly
either
rich
or
famous
kennedy
was
as
good
as
his
word
in
regard
to
helping
him
find
a
market
for
his
work
a
proud
moment
it
was
when
the
young
author
received
a
note
from
his
patron
inviting
him
to
dine
with
wilmer
the
editor
of
saturday
which
had
given
him
the
prize
and
some
other
gentlemen
of
the
profession
of
journalism
but
his
pleasure
was
followed
by
quick
mortification
should
he
wear
still
holding
the
open
note
in
his
hand
he
looked
down
ruefully
at
his
clothes
his
only
ones
for
all
their
brushing
and
darning
they
were
unmistakably
shabby
utterly
unfit
to
grace
a
nearly
all
of
the
hundred
dollars
which
had
seemed
such
a
fortune
had
already
been
spent
to
pay
bills
incurred
during
his
illness
and
to
buy
provisions
for
the
bare
little
home
which
had
sheltered
him
in
his
need
and
which
had
become
so
dear
to
his
heart
no
he
could
not
go
to
the
dinner
but
what
excuse
could
he
make
that
would
seem
to
kennedy
sufficient
to
warrant
him
in
not
only
declining
his
hospitality
but
putting
from
him
the
chance
of
meeting
the
editor
of
the
under
such
auspices
at
length
he
decided
that
in
this
case
absolute
frankness
was
his
only
course
my
dear
kennedy
he
wrote
your
invitation
to
dinner
has
wounded
me
to
the
quick
i
can
not
come
for
reasons
of
the
most
humiliating
nature
my
personal
appearance
you
may
imagine
my
mortification
in
making
this
disclosure
to
you
but
it
is
necessary
as
he
was
about
in
bitterness
of
soul
to
add
his
signature
a
sudden
thought
caused
him
to
pause
pen
poised
in
air
a
thought
a
temptation
would
perhaps
be
a
better
word
it
bade
him
consider
carefully
before
throwing
away
his
chance
who
knew
who
could
tell
it
questioned
how
much
might
depend
upon
this
meeting
his
fortune
might
be
made
by
it
almost
certainly
it
would
lead
to
the
sale
of
some
more
of
his
stories
to
the
kennedy
believed
that
it
would
have
this
result
for
this
purpose
he
had
arranged
it
after
taking
so
much
pains
for
his
benefit
he
would
undoubtedly
be
disappointed
seriously
disappointed
if
his
plan
should
fail
kennedy
had
been
so
kind
so
generous
doubtless
he
would
gladly
advance
him
a
sum
sufficient
to
make
himself
presentable
for
the
dinner
to
be
paid
by
the
first
check
received
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
a
very
modest
sum
would
do
he
might
manage
it
he
thought
with
twenty
dollars
finally
he
drew
his
unfinished
note
before
him
again
and
added
to
what
he
had
written
if
you
will
be
my
friend
so
far
as
to
loan
me
twenty
dollars
i
will
be
with
you
tomorrow
otherwise
it
will
be
impossible
and
i
must
submit
to
my
fate
sincerely
yours

the
dinner
went
off
charmingly
in
addition
to
several
journalists
latrobe
and
miller
who
with
kennedy
had
formed
the
committee
that
awarded
the
prize
to
edgar
poe
were
there
and
the
meeting
between
the
young
guest
of
honor
and
his
patrons
engendered
a
spirit
of
that
was
palpable
to
all
under
its
spell
the
spirits
rose
yet
he
was
quiet
listening
with
deep
attention
to
the
conversation
of
his
elders
but
having
little
to
say
until
the
repast
was
half
over
when
he
responded
to
the
evident
desire
of
his
host
to
draw
him
out
the
conversation
had
turned
upon
a
favorite
theme
of
his
the
power
of
words
he
threw
himself
into
it
with
zest
and
with
brilliant
play
of
expression
animating
his
splendid
eyes
and
pale
features
and
the
graceful
unrestrained
gestures
of
one
thoroughly
at
ease
and
entirely
unconscious
of
self
he
held
the
table
with
a
flow
of
sparkling
talk
in
which
his
own
exquisite
choice
of
words
delighted
his
hearers
no
less
than
the
originality
and
beauty
of
his
thought
in
the
young
editor
of
saturday
he
promptly
found
a
second
friend
among
men
of
letters
wilmer
already
prejudiced
in
his
favor
by
the
success
of
the
found
in
a
bottle
and
its
cordial
reception
by
the
public
and
by
kennedy
warm
words
of
recommendation
yielded
at
once
to
the
witchery
of
the
poetic
eyes
the
courtly
manners
and
the
charmed
tongue
and
not
only
befriended
him
by
inviting
and
accepting
his
writings
for
publication
but
gave
him
as
time
went
on
what
proved
to
be
a
stimulant
to
good
work
as
well
as
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
the
intimate
companionship
of
a
man
of
congenial
tastes
and
near
his
own
age
the
winter
that
followed
was
one
of
the
happiest
of
the
life
a
lull
in
a
tempest
a
dream
of
peace
within
a
dream
of
storm
and
stress
he
was
soon
able
to
return
the
twenty
dollars
to
kennedy
the
newspapers
kept
him
busy
and
while
the
returns
were
so
far
small
he
was
hopeful
he
felt
that
he
had
made
a
beginning
and
that
the
future
promised
well
his
work
was
praised
and
he
became
something
of
a
lion
the
doors
of
many
a
proud
baltimore
home
opening
graciously
to
his
touch
he
cared
little
for
general
society
however
his
greatest
pleasure
he
found
in
his
evenings
with
the
kennedys
for
kennedy
had
taken
him
in
as
promptly
as
her
husband
or
in
a
canter
far
into
the
country
on
the
saddle
horse
which
kennedy
noting
his
pallor
and
thinking
that
exercise
would
be
of
benefit
to
him
kindly
placed
at
his
disposal
or
in
walks
in
the
fields
and
lanes
beyond
the
city
with
his
new
chum
wilmer
many
a
fine
afternoon
saw
these
two
cronies
often
accompanied
by
the
sprite
virginia
with
her
airy
movements
and
vivid
beauty
rambling
in
the
suburbs
and
beyond
with
heads
close
in
intimate
communion
of
thought
and
fancy
what
he
enjoyed
most
of
all
was
the
time
spent
at
his
desk
in
the
shelter
of
the
haven
of
rest
with
the
happy
muddie
and
sissy
nearby
this
little
family
circle
was
unique
there
was
an
unmistakably
element
in
the
nature
of
the
widow
which
was
apparent
to
some
degree
even
in
her
outward
appearance
in
the
stateliness
and
dignity
of
her
figure
and
carriage
an
element
of
sturdiness
and
which
made
it
her
pleasure
to
be
clung
to
looked
up
to
leaned
upon
the
character
of
her
son
was
on
the
contrary
he
was
constantly
reaching
out
tendrils
of
craving
for
love
for
appreciation
for
understanding
more
for
advice
for
guidance
such
tendrils
seeking
a
make
a
strong
appeal
to
every
womanly
woman
she
sees
in
them
a
call
to
her
nobility
of
soul
to
the
mother
that
is
a
part
of
her
spiritual
nature
a
call
that
gives
her
pleasant
sensations
that
soften
her
heart
and
flatter
her
to
the
widow
clemm
with
her
and
her
highly
developed
maternal
instinct
the
appeal
was
irresistible
and
between
her
and
the
dreamer
the
ivy
and
oak
relation
was
promptly
established
while
in
the
little
virginia
he
found
a
heartsease
blossom
to
be
loved
and
sheltered
by
both
the
loveliest
of
heartsease
blossoms
whose
beauty
whose
purity
and
innocence
and
the
stored
sweets
of
whose
nature
were
all
for
him
the
three
lived
indeed
for
each
other
only
in
a
apart
from
and
invisible
to
the
rest
of
the
world
for
their
dreams
of
which
it
was
constructed
made
it
theirs
and
theirs
alone
their
dreams
piled
beautiful
mountains
around
the
valley
through
which
peace
flowed
as
a
gentle
river
while
love
and
contentment
and
innocent
pleasures
were
as
flowers
besprinkling
the
grass
and
speaking
to
their
hearts
of
the
love
and
the
glory
of
god
and
the
fancies
with
which
they
beguiled
the
time
were
as
tall
fantastic
trees
moved
by
soft
zephyrs
and
because
of
the
bright
flowers
ever
springing
in
the
green
turf
that
carpeted
the
valley
they
named
it
the
of
the
and
to
the
three
the
with
its
peace
and
its
beauty
and
its
sweet
seclusion
was
the
real
world
while
all
the
wilderness
outside
of
it
where
other
men
dwelt
was
the
unreal
one
happy
effect
of
these
peaceful
days
upon
the
dreamer
was
that
there
was
in
them
no
temptation
to
excess
no
restless
craving
for
excitement
the
bohemian
the
edgar
goodfellow
side
of
him
found
it
is
true
an
outlet
but
a
harmless
one
he
found
it
in
the
genial
atmosphere
of
the
widow
meagher
modest
where
he
and
his
new
crony
wilmer
passed
many
a
jolly
hour
the
widow
an
elderly
portly
dame
with
a
kind
irish
heart
and
keen
irish
wit
had
the
power
of
diffusing
a
wonderful
cheerfulness
around
her
her
shop
was
clean
if
plain
her
oysters
were
savory
if
cheap
like
all
women
she
petted
edgar
poe
and
hearing
from
wilmer
that
he
was
a
poet
she
at
once
gave
him
the
name
by
which
the
west
point
boys
had
called
him
and
to
all
of
the
frequenters
of
her
shop
he
was
known
as
the
bard
her
shop
had
not
only
an
oyster
counter
but
a
bar
and
a
room
for
cards
and
smoking
but
these
had
little
attraction
for
poe
at
this
period
of
his
career
much
to
the
widow
dissatisfaction
for
she
wished
the
bard
to
be
merry
and
did
not
like
to
see
him
neglect
what
she
honestly
and
unblushingly
believed
to
be
the
really
good
things
of
life
but
though
to
her
pressing
invitations
bard
take
a
hand
bard
take
a
nip
he
was
generally
deaf
he
was
more
accomodating
when
after
getting
off
an
unusually
clever
bit
of
pleasantry
putting
her
customers
into
an
uproar
of
laughter
she
would
turn
to
him
with
bard
put
it
in
poethry
and
put
it
in
poethry
he
did
to
the
increased
hilarity
of
the
crowd
the
month
of
february
brought
an
interruption
to
the
smooth
and
pleasant
course
of
the
dreamer
life
a
long
time
had
passed
since
he
had
heard
anything
of
his
friends
down
in
virginia
and
it
was
therefore
with
quick
interest
that
he
broke
the
seal
of
a
letter
bearing
the
richmond
and
addressed
to
him
in
the
unforgotten
hand
of
his
early
admirer
rob
sully
dear
old
rob
the
sight
of
the
familiar
alone
warmed
the
dreamer
heart
and
brought
the
soft
melting
expression
to
his
eyes
the
object
of
the
letter
was
to
tell
him
that
allan
was
extremely
ill
dying
some
thought
though
the
end
might
not
be
immediate
rob
was
taking
it
upon
himself
to
write
because
he
felt
that
eddie
ought
to
know
allan
had
lately
been
heard
to
speak
kindly
of
eddie
he
had
been
told
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
eddie
might
like
to
come
on
and
have
a
word
of
forgiveness
from
him
before
he
died
as
eddie
read
the
pleasure
the
first
sight
of
the
letter
had
given
him
turned
to
sudden
sharp
pain
allan
and
he
had
never
thought
of
associating
the
two
under
the
influence
of
the
shock
his
heart
became
all
tenderness
and
regret
he
hurriedly
packed
his
kissed
clemm
and
virginia
goodbye
and
set
out
for
richmond
and
the
homestead
on
main
and
fifth
streets
he
did
not
stop
to
lift
the
brass
knocker
this
time
the
forlorn
details
of
his
last
visit
his
lack
of
right
to
cross
that
threshold
uninvited
what
mattered
such
considerations
now
they
were
indeed
forgotten
everything
was
forgotten
everything
save
that
the
man
who
had
stood
in
the
position
of
father
to
him
was
dying
dying
without
a
word
of
pardon
to
him
the
most
wayward
he
felt
at
that
moment
of
severe
contrition
most
of
prodigal
sons
everything
was
forgotten
save
that
he
was
having
a
race
with
death
a
race
for
a
father
blessing
he
flung
wide
the
massive
front
door
and
hastened
through
the
spacious
hall
up
the
stair
and
into
the
room
where
the
ill
man
sat
in
an
on
the
threshold
he
paused
for
a
moment
allan
saw
and
recognized
him
and
at
once
the
misunderstanding
of
the
actions
of
his
adopted
son
for
which
he
seemed
to
have
a
gift
asserted
itself
construing
the
visit
as
an
unpardonable
liberty
the
only
motive
allan
could
imagine
which
could
have
prompted
edgar
poe
to
force
himself
as
it
seemed
to
him
into
his
presence
at
this
time
was
a
mercenary
one
and
burning
with
indignation
his
eyes
gleaming
with
something
like
their
old
fire
he
half
raised
himself
from
the
chair
how
dare
you
he
screamed
in
the
grating
tones
of
angry
old
age
then
grasping
the
cane
at
his
side
in
trembling
fingers
and
raising
it
with
threatening
gesture
he
ordered
his
visitor
to
leave
the
room
at
once
edgar
poe
stood
aghast
for
a
moment
then
fled
down
the
stair
and
out
of
the
door
and
turning
his
back
for
the
last
time
upon
the
house
whose
young
master
he
had
been
with
the
word
nevermore
ringing
like
a
knell
in
his
ears
made
his
way
again
to
the
abode
of
love
and
peace
in
baltimore
which
held
his
whole
heart
and
which
had
become
his
home
a
few
weeks
later
allan
died
leaving
the
whole
of
his
fortune
to
his
second
wife
and
her
children
it
now
became
more
important
than
ever
for
edgar
poe
to
earn
a
living
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
allan
was
known
to
have
lost
all
regard
for
him
his
friends
had
always
believed
that
he
would
be
remembered
in
the
will
they
believed
that
john
allan
rigid
sometimes
even
strained
idea
of
justice
would
cause
him
to
provide
for
the
boy
for
whom
he
had
voluntarily
albeit
against
his
own
judgment
made
himself
responsible
the
fact
that
the
boy
had
turned
out
to
be
in
opinion
trifling
that
he
refused
to
engage
in
any
useful
work
and
that
at
five
and
twenty
years
of
age
he
had
not
established
himself
in
any
paying
business
would
those
who
knew
allan
best
believed
be
with
him
but
another
reason
for
ensuring
against
want
his
first
spoiled
darling
who
was
evidently
incapable
of
taking
care
of
himself
and
therefore
so
they
believed
he
would
argue
so
much
the
more
his
care
possibly
the
dreamer
may
have
taken
this
view
himself
however
that
may
be
the
opening
of
the
will
silenced
all
conjecture
and
as
has
been
said
made
the
need
of
his
making
his
work
produce
money
more
pressing
than
ever
his
friend
wilmer
did
his
best
for
him
publishing
his
stories
in
saturday
from
time
to
time
and
paying
him
as
well
as
he
was
able
but
wilmer
and
his
paper
were
poor
themselves
was
only
a
small
weekly
with
a
modest
subscription
list
it
had
little
to
pay
however
good
the
copy
and
that
little
and
mother
clemm
earnings
put
together
barely
kept
the
wolf
from
the
door
when
the
frequent
and
welcome
summons
to
the
bountiful
board
of
the
kennedys
came
the
young
poet
blushed
for
shame
in
the
pleasure
he
could
not
help
feeling
in
anticipation
of
the
chance
to
satisfy
his
chastened
appetite
and
he
often
found
himself
fearing
that
the
hunger
with
which
he
ate
the
good
things
which
these
kind
friends
placed
upon
his
plate
would
betray
the
necessary
frugality
of
the
dear
muddie
which
was
one
of
the
sacred
secrets
of
the
sweet
home
sometimes
his
pride
would
make
him
go
so
far
as
to
decline
delicious
morsels
in
the
hope
of
correcting
such
an
impression
if
it
should
exist
he
racked
his
brain
to
find
a
means
of
making
his
work
bring
him
more
money
upon
kennedy
advice
he
sent
his
tales
of
the
folio
club
to
the
philadelphia
publishing
house
of
carey
and
lea
after
several
weeks
of
anxious
waiting
he
received
a
letter
accepting
the
collection
for
publication
but
frankly
admitting
that
his
receiving
any
profit
from
the
sale
of
the
book
was
an
exceedingly
doubtful
matter
they
suggested
however
that
they
be
permitted
to
sell
some
of
the
tales
to
publishers
of
the
then
popular
annuals
reserving
the
right
to
reprint
them
in
the
book
to
this
the
author
gladly
consented
and
received
with
a
joy
that
was
pathetic
the
sum
of
fifteen
dollars
from
the
souvenir
which
had
purchased
one
of
the
tales
at
a
dollar
a
printed
page
he
and
wilmer
put
their
heads
together
in
dreams
of
literary
work
by
which
a
man
could
live
one
of
these
dreams
took
form
in
the
prospectus
of
a
purely
literary
journal
of
the
highest
class
which
was
to
be
in
its
criticisms
and
editorial
opinions
fearless
independent
and
sternly
just
but
the
scheme
required
capital
and
never
got
beyond
the
glowing
prospectus
in
spite
of
the
small
sums
that
came
to
him
as
veritable
from
the
sale
of
his
stories
and
from
odd
jobs
on
the
and
other
journals
edgar
poe
was
poor
miserably
poor
and
just
as
he
had
begun
to
flatter
himself
that
he
did
not
mind
that
he
would
bear
it
with
the
nonchalance
of
the
true
philosopher
he
believed
he
had
become
it
assumed
the
shape
of
horror
unspeakable
to
him
not
for
himself
if
there
were
only
himself
to
think
of
he
felt
assured
he
could
laugh
poverty
want
even
to
scorn
but
that
his
little
virginia
should
feel
the
pinch
was
damnable
two
years
had
made
marked
changes
in
virginia
she
was
losing
the
formless
plumpness
of
childhood
and
growing
rapidly
into
a
slight
and
graceful
maiden
a
rare
and
radiant
maiden
with
the
tender
light
of
womanhood
beginning
to
dawn
in
her
velvet
eyes
and
to
sweeten
the
curves
of
her
lips
a
maiden
lovelier
by
far
than
the
child
had
been
but
with
the
same
divine
purity
and
innocence
that
had
always
been
hers
that
were
his
for
her
beauty
her
purity
and
innocence
and
the
stored
sweets
of
her
nature
were
still
for
him
alone
and
for
him
alone
too
was
her
sweet
companionship
her
comradeship
of
which
he
never
wearied
under
his
guidance
her
mind
had
unfolded
like
a
flower
she
was
beginning
to
speak
fluently
in
french
and
in
italian
how
he
loved
the
musical
southern
accents
on
her
tongue
and
she
was
developing
an
exquisite
singing
voice
her
voice
was
her
crowning
grace
her
voice
was
his
delight
of
delights
as
he
gazed
into
the
shadows
that
lay
under
her
long
black
lashes
and
listened
to
her
voice
with
its
hint
of
hidden
springs
of
passion
his
pulses
stirred
at
the
thought
that
this
lovely
flower
of
dawning
womanhood
was
his
little
virginia
and
his
own
heart
ached
to
think
that
any
desire
of
hers
should
ever
be
denied
in
his
desperation
he
thought
of
teaching
and
applied
for
a
position
in
a
school
but
without
success
but
relief
was
at
hand
while
the
dreamer
and
his
friend
the
editor
of
saturday
had
been
building
literary
in
baltimore
a
journal
destined
to
take
something
approaching
such
a
stand
as
their
ideal
was
actually
founded
in
richmond
under
the
title
of
southern
literary
its
owner
and
publisher
thomas
white
was
no
dreamer
but
a
practical
printer
and
an
enterprising
man
of
business
early
in
this
year
the
year
white
wrote
to
kennedy
requesting
a
contribution
from
his
pen
for
the
new
magazine
and
as
was
to
be
expected
kennedy
with
his
wonted
thoughtfulness
of
his
literary
protegé
wrote
back
commending
to
white
notice
the
work
of
a
remarkable
young
man
by
the
name
of
edgar
poe
at
kennedy
suggestion
edgar
bundled
off
some
of
the
tales
of
the
folio
club
for
white
inspection
with
the
result
that
in
the
march
number
of
the
the
weird
story
berenice
appeared
it
and
its
author
became
at
once
the
talk
of
the
hour
and
when
the
history
of
the
adventures
of
hans
phaal
came
out
in
the
june
number
it
found
the
reading
public
ready
and
waiting
to
fall
upon
and
devour
it
other
stories
and
articles
followed
in
quick
succession
and
the
pungent
critiques
and
reviews
of
the
new
pen
were
looked
for
and
read
with
as
great
interest
as
the
tales
in
a
glow
over
the
prosperity
which
the
popularity
of
the
new
writer
was
bringing
his
magazine
white
wrote
to
him
offering
him
the
position
of
assistant
editor
with
a
salary
of
five
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
a
year
to
begin
with
of
course
the
offer
was
to
be
accepted
the
salary
small
as
it
was
seemed
to
the
dreamer
in
comparison
to
the
diminutive
and
irregular
sums
he
had
been
accustomed
to
receive
almost
like
wealth
but
its
acceptance
would
mean
for
the
present
anyhow
separation
a
break
in
the
small
home
circle
where
had
been
with
all
of
its
deprivations
so
much
of
joy
a
dissolving
of
the
magical
valley
of
the
grass
not
for
a
moment
he
vowed
to
mother
clemm
and
virginia
was
this
separation
to
be
looked
upon
as
permanent
just
so
soon
as
he
should
be
able
to
provide
a
home
for
them
in
richmond
he
would
have
them
with
him
again
and
there
they
would
reconstruct
their
but
for
the
present
the
present
in
spite
of
the
new
prosperity
was
unbearable
in
vain
the
mother
with
the
patience
born
of
her
superior
years
and
experience
assured
them
that
time
had
wings
and
that
the
days
of
absence
would
be
quickly
past
to
the
youthful
poet
and
the
little
maid
who
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
him
a
month
a
week
a
day
apart
seemed
an
eternity
in
the
midst
of
their
woe
at
the
prospect
a
miracle
happened
a
miracle
and
a
discovery
it
fell
upon
a
serene
summer
afternoon
when
the
two
children
they
were
both
that
at
heart
wandered
along
a
sweet
shady
lane
leading
from
the
outskirts
of
town
into
the
country
it
was
to
be
their
last
walk
together
for
who
knew
who
could
tell
how
long
the
poet
great
grey
eyes
wore
their
deepest
melancholy
and
the
little
maid
soft
brown
ones
too
were
full
of
trouble
for
had
not
their
love
turned
to
pain
they
spoke
little
for
the
love
and
the
pain
were
alike
too
deep
for
words
but
the
heart
of
each
was
filled
with
broodings
and
musings
upon
the
love
it
bore
the
other
and
upon
the
agony
of
parting
how
could
he
leave
her
the
poet
asked
himself
his
cherished
comrade
whose
beauty
whose
purity
and
innocence
the
stored
sweets
of
whose
nature
were
for
him
alone
into
his
life
of
loneliness
of
lovelessness
of
despair
a
life
from
which
everyone
who
had
really
cared
for
him
had
been
snatched
by
untimely
death
and
shut
away
from
him
forever
in
an
early
grave
a
life
where
there
had
been
not
only
sorrow
but
bitterness
where
there
had
been
pain
and
want
and
homelessness
and
desolate
wanderings
and
longings
for
the
unattainable
where
there
had
been
misunderstanding
and
distrust
and
temptation
and
defeat
into
such
a
life
this
wee
bit
of
maidenhood
this
true
heartsease
had
crept
and
blossomed
filling
heart
and
life
with
beauty
and
hope
and
love
with
blessed
healing
how
could
he
leave
her
to
others
she
seemed
wrapped
in
timid
reserve
he
only
had
the
key
to
the
fair
realm
of
her
unfolding
mind
how
could
he
bear
to
leave
her
for
even
a
little
while
how
barren
his
life
would
be
without
her
how
shorn
of
all
beauty
and
grace
and
what
would
her
life
be
without
him
to
whom
had
been
offered
up
all
her
beauty
and
the
stored
sweets
of
her
nature
who
would
guard
her
from
other
eyes
that
as
her
beauty
and
charm
came
to
their
full
bloom
might
look
covetously
upon
her
for
the
first
time
and
the
bare
suggestion
seemed
profanation
it
occured
to
him
that
a
day
might
come
when
as
this
slip
of
maidenhood
walked
forth
in
her
surpassing
beauty
and
her
precious
innocence
and
purity
the
eyes
of
a
man
might
make
note
of
her
loveliness
her
altogether
desirableness
might
rest
upon
her
with
hopes
of
possession
and
he
not
there
to
kill
him
upon
the
spot
what
if
in
his
absence
another
hand
should
be
stretched
to
pluck
his
heartsease
blossom
that
left
unguarded
unprotected
by
him
another
should
snatch
it
in
its
beauty
its
purity
and
innocence
to
his
bosom
the
thought
was
hell
faint
and
trembling
he
gazed
down
upon
her
as
they
strolled
along
compelling
her
soft
eyes
to
meet
his
anguished
ones
his
face
was
white
and
strained
with
his
misery
she
was
pale
and
trembling
too
and
there
was
dew
on
the
sweeping
lashes
and
as
she
lifted
them
and
looked
into
his
face
she
trembled
more
he
looked
upon
her
tenderly
marvelling
to
see
in
her
at
once
the
loveliest
of
children
and
of
women
a
woman
with
her
first
grief
there
was
in
his
voice
for
himself
and
for
her
as
he
murmured
brokenly
words
of
love
and
of
comfort
in
her
ear
and
in
her
voice
as
she
brokenly
answered
him
the
sun
was
setting
a
pageant
in
which
they
both
were
wont
to
take
exquisite
delight
but
they
could
not
look
at
the
glowing
heavens
for
the
heaven
of
love
and
of
beautiful
sorrow
that
each
found
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
suddenly
they
knew
the
knowledge
burst
upon
them
like
an
illumining
flood
how
or
whence
it
came
they
could
not
tell
nor
did
they
question
but
they
knew
that
the
love
they
bore
each
other
was
no
brother
and
sister
love
but
that
what
time
they
had
been
calling
each
other
buddie
and
sissy
there
had
been
growing
growing
in
their
hearts
the
red
red
rose
of
romance
the
love
betwixt
man
and
maid
of
which
poets
tell
knew
that
in
that
sweet
that
sad
that
wondrous
eventide
the
rose
had
burst
into
glorious
flower
they
trembled
in
the
presence
of
this
sweetest
miracle
the
beauty
and
solemnity
of
it
well
nigh
deprived
them
of
the
power
of
speech
a
divine
silence
fell
upon
them
and
they
slowly
softly
took
their
way
homeward
through
the
gathering
dusk
hand
in
hand
but
with
few
words
to
tell
the
mother
to
the
widow
their
disclosure
came
as
a
shock
at
first
she
thought
the
silly
pair
must
be
joking
then
that
they
were
mad
finally
she
realized
their
earnestness
and
their
happiness
and
saw
that
the
situation
was
serious
and
must
be
dealt
with
with
the
utmost
tact
still
she
could
hardly
believe
what
she
saw
and
heard
was
it
possible
that
the
demure
girl
talking
to
her
so
seriously
of
love
and
marriage
was
her
little
virginia
her
baby
and
that
these
two
should
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
cousins
brother
and
sister
almost
and
with
such
disparity
in
ages
thirteen
and
she
had
lived
long
enough
however
to
know
that
love
is
governed
by
no
rules
or
regulations
and
besides
she
had
kept
through
all
the
changes
and
chances
of
her
checkered
life
a
belief
in
true
love
as
fresh
as
a
girl
this
was
too
sacred
a
thing
to
be
carelessly
handled
only
it
was
not
what
she
would
have
chosen
yet
was
it
not
a
new
thought
came
to
her
a
revelation
inspiration
what
you
will
and
sunk
her
in
deep
revery
why
was
this
not
what
she
would
have
chosen
why
not
a
union
between
her
children
her
all
her
own
days
were
fast
running
out
she
could
not
live
and
make
a
home
for
them
always
then
what
would
become
of
them
she
would
die
happy
when
her
time
came
if
she
could
see
them
in
their
own
home
bound
by
the
most
sacred
the
most
indissoluble
of
ties
bound
together
until
death
should
part
them
she
fell
asleep
with
a
heart
full
of
thankfulness
to
god
for
his
mercies
a
quite
different
view
of
the
matter
was
taken
by
other
members
of
the
poe
connection
in
baltimore
particularly
the
men
who
positively
refused
to
regard
the
love
affair
as
anything
more
than
sentimental
nonsense
moonshine
they
called
it
which
would
be
as
fleeting
as
it
was
foolish
their
cousin
judge
neilson
poe
who
had
made
a
pet
of
virginia
was
especially
active
in
his
opposition
and
brought
every
argument
he
could
think
of
to
bear
upon
the
young
lovers
and
upon
clemm
in
his
endeavor
to
induce
them
to
break
the
engagement
but
he
only
succeeded
in
sending
virginia
flying
with
frightened
face
to
buddie
arms
vowing
as
much
to
cousin
neilson
disgust
she
hung
upon
his
neck
that
she
would
never
give
him
up
while
buddie
holding
her
close
assured
her
in
the
language
that
they
both
loved
that
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
take
her
from
him
chapter
xxi
midsummer
found
edgar
poe
in
richmond
and
regularly
at
work
upon
his
new
duties
in
the
office
of
southern
literary
he
felt
that
if
he
had
not
actually
reached
the
end
of
the
rainbow
it
was
at
least
in
sight
and
it
rested
upon
the
place
of
all
others
most
gratifying
to
him
the
dear
city
of
his
boyhood
whose
esteem
he
so
ardently
desired
most
soothing
to
his
pride
he
found
it
after
his
several
ignominious
retreats
to
return
in
triumph
a
successful
author
called
to
a
place
of
acknowledged
distinction
for
all
its
meagre
income
the
playmates
of
his
youth
now
substantial
citizens
of
the
little
capital
called
promptly
upon
him
at
his
they
were
glad
to
have
him
back
and
they
showed
it
glad
of
his
success
and
glad
and
proud
to
find
their
early
faith
in
his
powers
justified
their
early
astuteness
proven
all
richmond
indeed
received
him
with
open
arms
and
if
there
were
some
few
persons
who
could
not
forget
his
at
the
university
and
his
seeming
ingratitude
to
allan
who
they
declared
had
been
the
kindest
and
most
indulgent
of
fathers
to
him
and
who
did
not
invite
him
to
their
homes
or
accept
invitations
to
parties
given
in
his
honor
they
were
the
losers
he
had
friends
and
to
spare
yet
he
was
not
happy
the
ivy
had
been
torn
from
the
oak
and
there
was
no
sweet
heartsease
blossom
to
make
glad
his
road
to
made
daily
hourly
offerings
to
him
and
him
alone
of
the
beauty
physical
and
spiritual
that
his
soul
worshipped
of
beauty
and
of
unquestioning
love
and
sympathy
and
approbation
in
other
words
the
dreamer
was
sick
miserably
sick
with
the
disease
of
longing
longing
for
the
modest
home
and
the
invigorating
presence
of
the
mother
longing
that
was
exquisite
pain
for
the
sight
the
sound
the
touch
the
daily
companionship
of
the
child
who
without
losing
one
whit
of
the
purity
the
innocence
the
charm
of
childhood
had
so
suddenly
so
sweetly
become
a
woman
a
woman
embodying
all
of
his
dreams
a
woman
who
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
him
life
no
matter
what
else
it
might
give
life
without
the
soft
glance
of
her
eye
the
sweet
sound
of
her
voice
the
pure
touch
of
her
hand
within
his
hand
her
lips
upon
his
lips
was
become
an
empty
aching
void
after
two
years
of
the
sheltered
fireside
in
baltimore
whose
seclusion
had
made
the
dream
of
the
valley
of
the
grass
possible
the
with
its
hideous
clatter
its
gossip
and
its
commonplaceness
was
the
merest
of
a
home
it
was
stifling
how
was
a
dreamer
to
breathe
in
a
he
was
even
homesick
for
the
purr
and
the
comfortable
airs
of
the
old
white
cat
whenever
he
could
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
and
tried
to
forget
it
but
the
clatter
and
the
gossip
seemed
to
follow
him
their
din
lingering
in
his
ears
as
he
paced
the
streets
in
a
fever
of
disgust
and
longing
for
the
first
time
since
edgar
poe
had
opened
his
eyes
upon
the
tasteful
homelikeness
of
the
widow
clemm
chamber
and
the
tender
dark
eyes
of
virginia
searching
his
face
with
soft
wonder
the
old
restlessness
and
dissatisfaction
with
life
and
the
whole
scheme
of
things
were
upon
him
the
blue
devils
which
he
believed
had
been
exorcised
forever
had
him
in
their
clutches
whither
should
he
fly
from
their
harrassments
by
what
road
should
he
escape
at
the
answer
the
only
answer
vouchsafed
him
he
stood
aghast
no
no
he
cried
within
him
not
that
not
that
seeking
to
deafen
his
ears
to
a
voice
that
at
once
charmed
and
terrified
him
for
it
was
the
voice
of
a
demon
which
possessed
the
allurements
of
an
angel
a
demon
he
reckoned
he
had
long
ago
fast
bound
in
chains
from
which
it
would
never
have
the
strength
to
arise
it
was
the
voice
that
dwelt
in
the
cup
the
single
cup
so
innocent
seeming
so
really
innocent
for
many
yet
so
ruinous
for
him
for
with
all
its
promises
of
cheer
and
comfort
it
led
and
he
knew
it
to
disaster
bitterly
he
fought
to
drown
the
sounds
of
the
voice
but
the
more
he
deafened
his
ears
the
more
insistent
the
clearer
the
more
alluring
its
tones
became
and
it
followed
him
everywhere
at
every
board
where
he
was
a
guest
the
brimming
cup
stood
beside
his
plate
at
every
turn
of
the
street
he
was
buttonholed
by
some
friend
old
or
new
with
the
invitation
to
join
him
in
the
cup
of
kindness
at
every
evening
party
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
bevies
of
charming
young
hebes
who
as
innocent
as
angels
of
any
intention
of
doing
him
a
wrong
implored
him
to
propose
them
a
toast
how
could
he
refuse
them
especially
when
acquiescence
meant
escape
from
this
horrible
horrible
this
weight
that
was
bearing
his
spirits
down
crushing
them
therein
lay
the
tempter
power
not
in
appetite
he
was
no
swine
to
swill
for
love
of
the
draught
when
he
did
yield
he
drained
the
cup
scarce
tasting
its
contents
but
ah
the
freedom
from
the
sickness
that
tortured
him
the
weight
that
oppressed
him
and
ah
the
exhilaration
physical
and
mental
the
delightful
exhilaration
which
put
melancholy
to
flight
loosed
his
tongue
and
started
the
machinery
of
his
brain
which
robbed
the
past
of
regret
and
made
the
present
and
the
future
rosy
it
was
in
the
promise
of
this
exhilaration
that
the
seductiveness
of
the
dreaded
tones
lay
even
his
kindly
old
physician
diagnosing
the
pallor
of
his
cheeks
and
melancholy
in
his
eyes
as
a
touch
of
malaria
added
a
note
of
insistence
to
the
voice
as
he
prescribed
that
panacea
of
the
day
a
mint
julep
before
breakfast
yet
he
still
sternly
and
stoutly
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
voice
of
the
charmer
while
dejection
drew
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
its
depths
until
one
day
he
found
he
could
not
write
his
pen
seemed
suddenly
to
have
lost
its
power
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
office
of
the
with
paper
before
him
with
pens
and
ink
at
hand
but
his
brain
refused
to
produce
an
idea
and
for
such
vague
as
came
to
him
he
could
find
no
words
to
give
expression
he
was
seized
upon
by
terror
had
his
gift
of
the
gods
deserted
him
better
death
than
life
without
his
gift
without
it
the
very
ground
under
his
feet
seemed
uncertain
and
unsafe
then
he
fell
driven
to
the
wall
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
took
the
only
road
he
saw
that
led
or
seemed
to
lead
to
deliverance
he
yielded
his
will
to
the
voice
of
the
tempter
he
tasted
the
freedom
the
exhilaration
the
wild
joy
that
his
imagination
had
pictured
drank
deep
of
it
and
then
he
paid
the
price
he
had
known
all
along
he
would
have
to
pay
though
in
the
hour
of
his
severest
temptation
the
knowledge
had
not
had
power
to
make
him
strong
neither
in
that
hour
had
he
been
able
to
foresee
how
hard
the
price
would
be
that
shadowy
yet
very
real
other
self
his
avenging
conscience
in
whose
approval
he
had
so
long
happily
rested
arose
in
its
wrath
and
rebuked
him
as
he
had
never
been
rebuked
before
it
scourged
him
it
held
up
before
him
his
bright
prospects
his
lately
acquired
and
enviable
social
position
assuring
him
as
it
held
them
up
of
their
insecurity
it
pointed
with
warning
finger
to
the
end
of
the
rainbow
and
the
road
leading
to
it
seemed
to
have
suddenly
grown
ten
times
longer
and
rougher
than
before
finally
it
held
up
the
images
of
his
two
good
angels
muddie
with
her
heart
of
oak
and
her
tender
face
and
virginia
whose
soft
eyes
were
a
heaven
of
trustful
love
whose
beauty
whose
purity
and
innocence
the
stored
sweets
of
whose
nature
were
for
him
alone
and
to
whom
he
was
as
faultless
as
supreme
as
the
sun
in
heaven
it
was
too
much
the
dejection
into
which
his
blue
devils
had
cast
him
was
as
nothing
to
the
remorse
that
overwhelmed
him
now
on
his
knees
before
heaven
he
confessed
that
his
last
estate
was
worse
than
his
first
and
cried
aloud
for
forgiveness
for
the
past
and
strength
for
the
future
in
this
mood
he
sat
down
to
write
to
kennedy
who
had
been
absent
upon
a
summer
vacation
when
he
left
baltimore
a
letter
of
acknowledgment
for
his
benefactions
for
whatever
the
dreamer
was
it
is
very
certain
that
he
was
ungrateful
the
date
he
placed
at
the
top
of
his
page
was
september
i
received
a
letter
yesterday
he
wrote
which
tells
me
you
are
back
in
town
i
hasten
therefore
to
write
you
and
express
by
letter
what
i
have
always
found
it
impossible
to
express
orally
my
deep
sense
of
gratitude
for
your
frequent
and
effectual
assistance
and
kindness
through
your
influence
white
has
been
induced
to
employ
me
in
assisting
him
with
the
editorial
duties
of
his
magazine
at
a
salary
of
per
annum
he
had
not
intended
to
mention
his
troubles
to
kennedy
but
with
each
word
he
wrote
the
impulse
to
unburden
himself
which
he
always
felt
when
talking
to
this
kind
sympathetic
man
grew
stronger
and
he
found
his
pen
almost
automatically
taking
an
unexpected
turn
it
was
out
of
the
abundance
of
his
anguished
heart
that
he
added
the
situation
is
agreeable
to
me
for
many
reasons
but
alas
it
appears
that
nothing
can
now
give
me
pleasure
or
the
slightest
gratification
excuse
me
my
dear
sir
if
in
this
letter
you
find
much
incoherency
my
feelings
at
this
moment
are
pitiable
indeed
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
am
still
miserable
in
spite
of
the
great
improvement
in
my
circumstances
for
a
man
who
is
writing
for
effect
does
not
write
thus
my
heart
is
open
before
you
if
it
be
worth
reading
read
it
i
am
wretched
and
know
not
why
console
me
for
you
can
convince
me
that
it
is
worth
one
while
to
live
persuade
me
to
do
what
is
right
you
will
not
fail
to
see
that
i
am
suffering
from
a
depression
of
spirits
which
will
ruin
me
if
it
be
long
continued
write
me
then
and
quickly
urge
me
to
do
what
is
right
your
words
will
have
more
weight
with
me
than
the
words
of
others
for
you
were
my
friend
when
no
one
else
was
some
men
of
more
goodness
than
wisdom
might
have
read
this
letter
with
impatience
perhaps
disgust
and
tossed
it
into
the
waste
basket
not
deeming
it
worth
an
answer
or
it
to
be
answered
in
a
more
convenient
season
which
would
probably
never
have
arrived
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
contempt
with
which
john
allan
would
have
perused
it
not
so
john
kennedy
busy
lawyer
and
successful
man
of
letters
and
of
the
world
though
he
was
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
stretch
a
hand
to
the
gifted
starveling
he
had
discovered
struggling
for
a
foothold
on
the
bottommost
rung
of
the
ladder
of
literary
fame
and
had
not
only
helped
him
up
the
ladder
but
had
drawn
him
in
his
weakness
and
his
strength
into
the
circle
of
his
friendship
and
now
he
had
no
idea
of
letting
him
go
kennedy
was
a
great
lawyer
with
a
great
tenderness
for
human
nature
born
of
a
great
knowledge
of
it
he
did
not
expect
young
men
even
talented
ones
to
be
faultless
or
to
be
fountains
of
sound
sense
or
even
always
to
be
strong
of
will
when
he
received
edgar
wail
he
had
just
returned
to
his
office
after
a
long
vacation
and
found
himself
over
head
and
ears
in
work
but
he
responded
at
once
if
it
had
seemed
to
him
a
foolish
letter
he
did
not
say
so
if
it
had
shocked
or
disappointed
him
he
did
not
say
so
he
wrote
in
the
kindly
tolerant
and
understanding
tone
he
always
took
with
his
protegé
a
letter
wholesome
and
bracing
as
a
breath
from
the
salt
sea
my
dear
poe
he
began
in
his
simple
familiar
way
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
in
such
plight
as
your
letter
shows
you
in
it
is
strange
that
just
at
the
time
when
everybody
is
praising
you
and
when
fortune
has
begun
to
smile
upon
your
hitherto
wretched
circumstances
you
should
be
invaded
by
these
villainous
blue
devils
it
belongs
however
to
your
age
and
temper
to
be
thus
buffeted
but
be
assured
it
only
wants
a
little
resolution
to
master
the
adversary
forever
rise
early
live
generously
and
make
cheerful
acquaintances
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
send
these
misgivings
of
the
heart
all
to
the
devil
you
will
doubtless
do
well
henceforth
in
literature
and
add
to
your
comforts
as
well
as
your
reputation
which
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
tell
you
is
everywhere
rising
in
popular
esteem
this
and
more
he
wrote
in
kind
encouraging
vein
and
closed
his
letter
with
a
friendly
invitation
write
to
me
frequently
and
believe
me
very
truly
yours
john
p
kennedy
the
same
post
that
brought
kennedy
letter
brought
the
dreamer
other
mail
from
baltimore
brought
him
letters
from
both
virginia
and
mother
clemm
they
had
an
especial
reason
for
writing
each
said
they
had
news
for
him
news
which
was
most
disturbing
to
them
and
they
feared
it
would
be
to
him
disturbing
indeed
was
the
news
the
letters
brought
it
drove
him
into
a
rage
and
aroused
him
into
action
which
made
him
forget
all
of
his
late
troubles
their
cousin
neilson
and
his
wife
they
wrote
him
had
not
ceased
to
bring
every
argument
they
could
think
of
to
bear
upon
virginia
to
induce
her
to
break
her
engagement
and
had
finally
proposed
that
they
should
take
her
into
their
home
treat
her
as
an
own
daughter
or
young
sister
providing
for
her
all
things
needful
and
desirable
for
a
young
girl
of
her
station
until
her
eighteenth
birthday
after
which
if
she
and
edgar
had
not
changed
their
minds
they
could
be
married
he
dashed
off
and
posted
answers
to
the
letters
at
once
making
violent
protest
against
a
scheme
that
seemed
to
him
positively
iniquitous
and
pleading
with
muddie
to
keep
virginia
for
him
but
writing
was
not
enough
he
determined
to
answer
in
person
a
day
or
two
later
virginia
and
her
mother
were
in
the
act
of
discussing
his
letters
which
had
just
come
when
the
door
quietly
opened
and
there
stood
the
man
who
was
all
the
world
to
them
virginia
with
a
scream
of
delight
was
in
his
arms
in
a
flash
and
began
telling
him
breathlessly
what
a
fright
she
had
been
in
for
fear
cousin
neilson
would
take
her
away
and
she
would
never
see
him
again
with
a
rising
tide
of
tenderness
for
her
and
rage
against
their
cousin
he
kissed
the
trouble
from
her
eyes
do
be
afraid
sweetheart
he
murmured
he
shall
never
take
you
from
me
i
have
come
back
to
marry
you
to
marry
her
exclaimed
clemm
at
once
do
you
mean
at
once
today
or
tomorrow
for
i
must
be
getting
back
to
richmond
as
soon
as
possible
do
you
see
muddie
that
this
is
just
a
plot
of
neilson
to
separate
us
he
never
cared
for
me
he
loves
virginia
and
is
determined
i
shall
not
have
her
but
we
outwit
him
we
be
married
at
once
we
have
to
keep
it
secret
at
first
until
i
am
able
to
provide
a
home
for
my
little
wife
and
our
dear
mother
in
richmond
but
i
will
go
away
with
peace
of
mind
and
leave
her
in
peace
of
mind
for
once
she
is
mine
only
death
can
come
between
us
we
will
keep
it
secret
dear
he
added
with
his
lips
on
the
dusky
hair
of
the
little
maid
who
was
still
held
fast
in
his
arms
we
will
keep
it
secret
but
if
neilson
poe
becomes
troublesome
you
will
only
have
to
show
him
your
marriage
certificate
virginia
joyfully
agreed
to
this
plan
while
the
widow
finding
opposition
useless
finally
consented
too
and
the
impetuous
lover
was
off
for
a
license
it
was
a
unique
little
wedding
which
took
place
next
day
in
christ
church
when
a
beautiful
dreamy
looking
youth
with
intellectual
brow
and
classic
profile
and
a
beautiful
maid
half
his
age
plighted
their
troth
the
only
attendant
was
mother
clemm
in
her
habitual
plain
black
dress
and
widow
cap
with
floating
sheer
and
snowy
white
no
music
no
flowers
no
witnesses
even
save
the
widowed
mother
and
the
aged
sexton
who
was
bound
over
to
strict
secrecy
but
in
the
dim
still
empty
church
the
beautiful
words
of
the
old
old
rite
seemed
to
this
strange
pair
of
lovers
to
take
on
new
solemnity
as
they
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
white
robed
priest
and
sank
deep
into
their
young
hearts
filling
and
thrilling
them
with
fresh
hope
and
faith
and
love
and
high
resolve
chapter
xxii
in
the
following
spring
edgar
poe
and
virginia
clemm
were
strange
as
it
may
seem
principals
in
another
wedding
the
months
intervening
between
the
two
ceremonies
had
been
teeming
with
interest
to
them
both
filled
with
work
and
with
happiness
just
short
of
that
perfect
satisfaction
that
completeness
that
unattainable
which
it
is
part
of
being
a
mortal
with
an
immortal
mind
and
soul
to
be
continually
striving
after
and
missing
and
will
be
until
the
of
this
world
is
merged
into
the
light
ineffable
of
the
one
to
come
the
dreamer
had
returned
from
his
brief
visit
to
baltimore
a
new
man
the
blue
devils
were
gone
the
heart
and
mind
which
they
had
made
their
were
swept
clean
of
every
vestige
of
them
and
were
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
sweet
and
rare
presence
the
presence
of
her
who
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
him
for
he
felt
that
her
spirit
was
with
him
at
every
moment
of
the
day
though
her
fair
body
was
other
whither
the
consciousness
of
the
secret
he
carried
in
his
heart
flooded
his
nature
with
sunshine
because
of
it
he
carried
his
head
more
proudly
wore
a
new
dignity
which
his
friends
attributed
entirely
to
the
success
of
his
work
upon
the
magazine
he
was
filled
with
peace
and
good
will
to
all
the
world
he
was
happy
and
wanted
everybody
else
to
be
happy
it
was
apparent
in
himself
and
in
his
work
in
his
dreamy
moods
his
fancy
spread
a
broader
a
stronger
wing
and
soared
with
new
daring
to
heights
unexplored
before
when
edgar
goodfellow
was
in
the
ascendency
he
threw
himself
with
unwonted
zest
into
the
pleasures
that
were
like
poppies
spread
in
the
way
of
the
successful
author
and
editor
the
literary
lion
of
the
town
he
had
always
been
an
enthusiastic
and
graceful
dancer
and
now
nothing
else
seemed
to
give
him
so
natural
a
vent
for
the
happiness
that
was
beating
in
his
veins
his
feet
seemed
like
his
pen
to
be
inspired
he
felt
that
he
could
dance
till
doomsday
and
all
the
prettiest
most
bewitching
girls
let
him
see
how
pleased
they
were
to
have
him
for
a
partner
in
the
brief
glowing
rests
between
the
dances
he
rewarded
them
with
charming
talk
and
verses
in
praise
of
their
loveliness
which
seemed
to
fall
without
the
slightest
effort
from
his
tongue
into
their
pretty
delighted
ears
or
from
his
pencil
into
their
albums
there
was
at
least
one
fair
damsel
a
slight
willowy
creature
with
violet
eyes
and
flaxen
ringlets
who
treasured
the
graceful
lines
he
dedicated
to
her
with
a
feeling
warmer
than
friendship
she
was
pretty
eliza
white
the
daughter
of
his
employer
the
owner
of
the
literary
she
was
herself
a
lover
of
poetry
and
romance
and
a
dreamer
of
dreams
all
of
which
had
erelong
merged
into
one
sweet
dream
so
secret
so
sacred
that
she
scarce
dared
own
it
to
her
own
inner
self
and
its
central
figure
was
her
father
handsome
assistant
editor
who
rested
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
havoc
he
was
making
in
her
maiden
heart
engrossed
as
he
was
in
his
own
secret
his
own
romance
new
energy
new
zest
new
life
seemed
to
have
entered
his
blood
he
had
endless
capacity
for
work
as
well
as
for
pleasure
and
could
write
all
day
and
dance
half
the
night
and
then
lie
awake
the
other
half
and
rise
ready
and
eager
for
the
day
work
in
the
morning
such
a
tonic
such
a
stimulant
did
his
love
for
his
faraway
bride
and
his
consciousness
of
her
love
for
him
prove
he
was
happy
very
very
happy
but
he
desired
to
be
happier
still
the
simple
beautiful
words
of
the
old
old
rite
uttered
in
the
dim
empty
church
had
woven
an
invisible
bond
between
him
and
the
maiden
whom
he
loved
to
call
in
his
heart
his
wife
though
the
time
when
he
could
claim
her
before
the
world
was
not
yet
the
miracle
that
this
bond
wrought
in
him
was
a
revelation
to
him
was
the
priest
a
wizard
did
the
words
of
the
ancient
rite
possess
any
intrinsic
power
of
enchantment
undreamed
of
by
the
uninitiated
he
had
not
believed
it
possible
for
mortal
to
love
more
wholly
more
madly
than
he
had
loved
the
little
virginia
before
that
sacred
ceremony
but
after
it
he
knew
there
were
heights
of
love
of
which
he
had
not
hitherto
had
a
glimpse
just
the
right
to
say
to
his
heart
she
is
my
own
my
wife
made
her
tenfold
more
precious
than
she
had
ever
been
before
but
it
also
made
the
separation
tenfold
harder
to
bear
made
it
beyond
his
power
to
bear
the
valley
of
the
grass
had
been
dissolved
the
spell
that
had
brought
it
into
being
broken
by
the
separation
and
he
longed
with
a
longing
that
was
as
hunger
and
thirst
to
reconstruct
this
magical
world
in
which
he
and
his
virginia
dwelt
apart
with
her
who
was
mother
to
them
both
in
richmond
and
so
poor
as
he
was
he
arranged
to
bring
virginia
and
mother
clemm
to
richmond
and
establish
them
in
a
boarding
house
where
he
could
see
them
often
and
wait
with
better
grace
the
still
happier
day
of
making
his
marriage
public
the
day
came
more
speedily
than
they
had
let
themselves
hope
the
popularity
of
the
and
the
fame
of
its
assistant
editor
had
grown
with
leaps
and
bounds
the
new
year
brought
the
welcome
gift
of
promotion
to
full
editorship
with
an
increase
of
salary
with
the
opening
spring
began
plans
for
the
divulging
of
the
great
secret
for
public
acknowledgment
of
the
marriage
but
how
was
it
to
be
done
that
was
the
question
edgar
poe
knew
too
well
the
disapproval
with
which
the
world
regarded
secret
marriages
with
which
he
himself
regarded
them
ordinarily
his
sense
of
refinement
of
fitness
of
the
sacredness
of
the
marriage
tie
revolted
from
the
very
idea
in
what
fashion
then
could
he
and
his
little
bride
proclaim
their
secret
that
would
not
do
violence
to
their
own
taste
or
set
a
buzz
of
gossip
going
that
the
horrid
lips
of
gossip
should
so
much
as
breathe
the
name
of
his
virginia
that
grundy
should
dare
shrug
her
decorous
shoulders
if
ever
so
slightly
at
mention
of
that
sacred
name
the
bare
suggestion
was
intolerable
at
last
a
solution
offered
itself
to
his
mind
not
for
an
instant
did
he
regret
the
sacred
ceremony
in
christ
church
baltimore
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
cut
short
for
one
moment
of
time
the
duration
of
the
beautiful
spiritual
marriage
when
he
had
been
able
to
say
to
himself
she
whose
presence
fills
my
heart
and
my
life
whose
spirit
i
can
feel
near
me
at
my
work
in
my
hours
of
recreation
and
in
my
dreams
is
my
wife
but
of
this
exquisite
this
inexpressibly
dear
union
the
world
was
in
utter
ignorance
it
was
known
only
to
the
mother
the
priest
and
the
aged
sexton
to
these
witnesses
always
as
to
themselves
their
marriage
would
date
from
the
moment
when
the
blessing
was
invoked
above
their
bowed
heads
in
christ
church
but
to
the
world
why
not
let
it
date
from
the
day
in
which
they
would
claim
each
other
before
the
world
in
richmond
the
thing
was
most
simple
a
second
ceremony
in
the
presence
of
a
few
friends
a
brief
announcement
in
next
day
paper
and
their
life
would
be
begun
with
the
dignity
the
prestige
of
public
marriage
the
sixteenth
of
may
was
the
day
chosen
for
the
event
which
was
more
like
a
wedding
in
arcady
than
in
society
as
at
the
secret
ceremony
the
customary
preparations
for
a
wedding
were
conspicuously
absent
yet
was
not
the
whole
town
gala
with
sunshine
and
verdure
and
and
edgar
poe
looked
every
inch
a
bridegroom
as
with
his
upon
his
arm
he
stepped
forth
from
yarrington
opposite
the
green
slopes
of
capitol
square
a
bridegroom
indeed
plainly
but
perfectly
apparelled
handsome
proud
fearless
his
great
eyes
luminous
with
solemn
joy
the
simplest
of
white
frocks
became
virginia
innocence
and
beauty
more
than
costly
bridal
array
and
the
nosegay
of
white
violets
above
her
chaste
bosom
was
her
only
ornament
with
this
sweet
pair
came
the
happy
mother
and
a
little
train
of
close
friends
it
was
late
afternoon
the
sunshine
was
mellow
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
delicious
insense
which
in
the
majestic
paulonia
tree
drops
from
its
purple
bells
and
which
is
the
very
breath
of
the
south
no
line
of
carriages
stood
at
the
door
no
awning
shut
the
picture
they
made
from
admiring
eyes
but
happily
the
little
party
chatted
together
as
they
strolled
under
greenery
to
the
corner
of
main
and
seventh
streets
where
in
the
prim
parlor
of
the
presbyterian
minister
the
words
were
pronounced
which
told
the
world
that
edgar
poe
and
virginia
clemm
were
one
upon
the
return
of
the
party
to
yarrington
a
cake
was
cut
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
bride
and
groom
were
drunk
in
wine
of
muddie
own
make
and
the
modest
festival
was
over
how
happy
the
young
lovers
and
dreamers
were
in
their
their
housekeeping
and
furnishings
were
the
simplest
but
love
made
everything
beautiful
and
sufficient
they
had
a
garden
in
which
they
planted
all
their
favorite
flowers
and
to
which
came
the
birds
the
birds
with
whom
they
had
discovered
a
sudden
kinship
for
they
too
were
nesting
and
filled
it
with
music
and
they
sang
and
chatted
as
happily
as
the
birds
themselves
as
the
pretty
business
progressed
how
delightful
it
was
to
receive
their
friends
together
in
their
own
home
and
at
their
own
board
eddie
old
friends
especially
rob
stanard
now
a
prosperous
lawyer
and
rob
sully
whose
reputation
as
an
artist
was
growing
were
the
first
to
call
and
present
their
compliments
to
the
bride
and
groom
and
how
cordial
they
were
how
affectionate
to
eddie
how
warm
in
their
expressions
of
friendship
for
the
virginia
found
it
the
greatest
fun
imaginable
to
go
to
market
with
muddie
with
a
basket
hanging
from
her
pretty
arm
the
market
men
and
women
began
to
daily
watch
for
the
sweet
face
and
tripping
step
of
the
exquisite
child
whom
it
seemed
so
comical
to
address
as
poe
and
who
rewarded
their
open
admiration
with
the
loveliest
smile
the
prettiest
words
of
greeting
and
interest
the
merriest
rippling
laugh
that
rang
through
the
market
place
and
waked
echoes
in
many
a
heart
that
had
believed
itself
a
stranger
to
joy
and
the
valley
of
the
grass
was
reconstructed
in
even
more
than
its
old
beauty
the
flowers
of
love
and
contentment
and
innocent
pleasure
that
besprinkled
its
green
carpet
had
never
been
so
many
or
so
gay
the
that
shut
it
in
from
the
rest
of
the
world
were
as
fair
as
sunset
clouds
and
the
peace
that
flowed
through
it
as
a
river
broke
into
singing
as
it
flowed
meantime
edgar
poe
worked
and
worked
and
worked
every
number
of
the
contained
page
after
page
of
the
brilliantly
conceived
and
artistically
worded
product
of
his
brain
and
pen
his
heart
his
imagination
satisfied
and
at
rest
in
the
love
and
comradeship
of
a
woman
who
fulfilled
his
ideal
of
beauty
of
character
and
of
charm
whose
mind
he
himself
had
taught
and
trained
to
appreciate
and
to
love
the
things
that
meant
most
to
him
whose
sympathy
responded
to
his
every
mood
whose
voice
soothed
his
tired
nerves
with
the
music
that
was
one
of
the
necessities
of
his
temperament
a
woman
withal
who
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
him
his
harassing
devils
cast
out
by
this
true
heartsease
edgar
poe
industry
and
his
power
of
mental
production
were
almost
past
belief
as
he
worked
a
dream
that
had
long
been
in
his
brain
took
definite
shape
and
became
the
moving
influence
of
the
intellectual
side
of
his
life
his
literary
conscience
had
always
been
strict
even
exacting
with
him
making
him
push
the
quest
for
the
right
word
in
which
to
express
his
idea
just
the
right
word
no
other
to
its
farthest
limit
urged
by
this
conscience
he
could
rarely
ever
feel
that
his
work
was
finished
but
kept
revising
polishing
and
republishing
it
in
improved
form
even
after
it
had
been
once
given
to
the
world
he
had
in
his
youth
contemplated
serving
his
country
as
a
soldier
he
now
began
to
dream
of
serving
her
as
a
captain
of
literature
as
it
were
as
a
defender
of
purity
of
style
for
this
dream
which
became
the
most
serious
purpose
of
his
life
was
of
raising
the
standard
of
american
letters
to
the
ideal
perfection
after
which
he
strove
in
his
own
writings
for
his
campaign
a
trusty
weapon
was
at
hand
in
the
editorial
department
of
the
literary
which
he
turned
into
a
sword
of
fearless
merciless
criticism
literary
criticism
so
called
in
america
had
been
hitherto
mere
puffery
puffery
for
the
most
part
of
weak
prolix
commonplace
scribblings
of
little
authors
and
poets
a
reformation
in
criticism
therefore
edgar
poe
conceived
to
be
the
only
remedy
for
the
prevalent
mediocrity
in
writing
that
was
vitiating
the
taste
of
the
day
the
only
hope
of
placing
american
literature
upon
a
footing
of
equality
with
that
of
england
in
a
word
for
bringing
about
anything
approaching
the
perfection
of
which
he
dreamed
the
new
kind
of
criticism
to
which
he
introduced
his
readers
created
a
sensation
by
reason
of
its
very
novelty
his
brilliant
but
withering
critiques
were
more
eagerly
looked
for
than
the
most
thrilling
of
his
stories
and
though
the
little
authors
whom
the
gleaming
sword
mowed
down
by
tens
were
his
and
the
enemies
for
life
the
interested
readers
that
were
gathered
in
by
hundreds
were
loud
in
their
praise
of
the
progressiveness
of
the
magazine
and
the
genius
of
the
man
who
was
making
it
in
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
the
name
of
edgar
poe
was
now
on
many
lips
and
serious
attention
began
to
be
paid
to
the
opinion
of
the
literary
chapter
xxiii
between
his
literary
work
his
home
and
his
social
life
in
richmond
it
would
seem
that
every
need
of
the
dreamer
being
was
now
satisfied
and
the
days
of
his
life
were
moving
in
perfect
harmony
but
the
little
rift
within
the
lute
all
too
soon
made
its
appearance
it
was
caused
by
the
alarm
of
white
the
owner
and
founder
of
the
little
tom
white
was
a
most
admirable
man
within
his
limitations
if
he
was
not
especially
interesting
his
daughter
eliza
of
the
violet
eyes
was
and
he
was
reliable
which
was
better
he
had
a
kind
little
heart
and
a
clear
little
business
head
and
his
advice
upon
all
matters
within
his
experience
was
safe
though
he
saw
from
the
handsome
increase
in
the
number
of
the
subscribers
that
his
young
editor
was
a
valuable
aid
he
did
not
realize
how
valuable
indeed
edgar
poe
and
his
style
of
writing
were
entirely
outside
of
white
experience
they
were
so
altogether
unlike
anything
he
had
known
before
that
in
spite
of
the
praise
of
the
thousands
of
readers
which
they
had
brought
to
the
magazine
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
tens
of
little
authors
alarmed
him
edgar
poe
found
him
one
morning
in
a
state
of
positive
trepidation
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
office
with
the
morning
mail
an
unusually
large
pile
of
it
before
him
in
it
there
were
a
number
of
new
subscriptions
several
letters
from
the
little
authors
protesting
against
the
manner
in
which
their
works
were
handled
in
the
review
columns
of
the
magazine
and
one
or
two
from
and
highly
respected
country
gentlemen
expressing
their
disapproval
of
the
in
edgar
poe
tales
and
poems
white
appreciated
the
genius
of
his
editor
within
his
limitations
but
he
was
afraid
of
it
and
these
letters
made
him
more
afraid
of
it
he
saw
that
he
must
speak
to
edgar
add
his
protest
to
the
protests
of
the
little
authors
and
the
country
gentlemen
and
see
if
he
could
not
persuade
him
to
tone
down
the
sharpness
of
his
criticisms
and
the
strangeness
of
his
stories
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
he
saw
the
trim
figure
of
the
young
editor
and
author
at
the
door
for
he
would
like
to
settle
the
business
before
him
at
once
his
manner
was
grave
solemn
as
he
approached
the
subject
upon
which
his
employe
must
be
spoken
to
edgar
he
said
when
had
been
exchanged
i
want
you
to
read
these
letters
they
are
in
the
same
line
as
some
others
we
have
been
receiving
lately
but
more
so
decidedly
more
so
ah
said
the
dreamer
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
desk
and
began
to
unfold
and
glance
over
the
letters
little
tom
watched
his
face
with
a
feeling
of
wonder
at
the
look
of
mixed
scorn
and
amusement
that
appeared
in
the
expressive
eyes
and
mouth
as
he
read
finally
the
anxious
little
man
laid
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
his
unruly
assistant
with
an
air
of
kindly
patronage
you
have
talent
edgar
he
said
with
a
touch
of
condescension
good
talent
especially
for
criticism
and
will
some
day
make
your
mark
in
that
line
if
you
will
stick
to
it
and
let
these
weird
stories
alone
we
must
have
fewer
of
the
stories
in
future
and
more
critiques
but
milder
ones
it
is
the
critiques
that
the
readers
want
but
in
both
stories
and
critiques
you
must
put
a
restraint
on
that
pen
of
yours
edgar
in
the
stories
less
of
the
weird
the
strange
in
the
critiques
less
of
the
satirical
let
moderation
be
your
watchword
my
boy
cultivate
moderation
in
your
writing
and
with
your
endowment
you
will
make
a
name
for
yourself
as
well
as
the
magazine
edgar
poe
was
all
attention
respectful
attention
that
was
most
encouraging
while
white
was
speaking
and
when
he
had
finished
sat
with
a
contemplative
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
weighing
the
words
he
had
just
heard
presently
he
looked
up
and
with
the
expression
of
face
and
voice
of
one
who
in
all
seriousness
seeks
information
asked
is
moderation
really
the
word
you
are
after
white
or
is
it
mediocrity
the
announcement
at
the
very
moment
when
the
question
was
put
of
a
visitor
a
welcome
one
for
he
brought
a
new
subscription
precluded
a
reply
and
in
the
busy
day
that
followed
the
broken
thread
of
conversation
was
never
taken
up
again
but
the
unanswered
question
left
white
with
a
confused
sense
which
stayed
with
him
during
the
whole
day
and
at
intervals
all
through
it
he
was
asking
himself
what
edgar
poe
meant
truly
his
talented
employe
was
a
puzzling
fellow
could
it
be
possible
that
the
question
asked
with
that
serious
face
that
quiet
respectful
air
was
intended
for
a
joke
that
the
impudent
fellow
could
have
been
quizzing
him
no
wonder
his
stories
gave
people
shivers
there
was
at
times
something
about
the
fellow
himself
which
was
positively
uncanny
that
he
and
little
tom
would
always
see
opposite
sides
of
the
picture
became
more
and
more
apparent
to
the
dreamer
as
time
went
on
and
along
with
this
difficulty
another
and
a
more
serious
one
arose
though
the
amount
of
work
of
successful
work
for
it
brought
the
a
steadily
increasing
stream
of
new
subscribers
which
he
was
now
putting
forth
should
have
surrounded
the
beloved
wife
and
mother
with
luxuries
and
placed
him
beyond
the
reach
of
financial
embarrassment
the
returns
he
received
from
the
entire
fruitage
of
his
brilliant
talent
his
untiring
pen
at
this
the
of
his
life
in
the
fullness
of
mental
and
physical
vigour
was
so
small
that
he
was
constantly
harrassed
by
debt
and
frequently
reduced
to
the
humiliating
necessity
of
borrowing
from
his
friends
to
make
two
ends
meet
the
plain
truth
was
gradually
borne
in
upon
him
the
prizes
of
fame
and
wealth
that
for
the
sake
of
his
sweet
bride
he
coveted
more
earnestly
than
ever
before
were
not
to
be
found
by
him
in
richmond
or
as
an
employe
of
white
but
the
hues
of
the
bow
of
promise
with
which
hope
spanned
the
sky
of
his
inward
vision
were
still
bright
and
he
believed
that
at
its
end
the
coveted
prizes
would
surely
still
be
found
provided
he
did
not
lose
heart
and
give
up
the
quest
indications
of
the
growth
of
his
reputation
at
the
north
had
been
many
in
the
north
the
facilities
for
publishing
were
so
much
more
abundant
than
in
the
south
the
publishing
houses
and
the
periodicals
of
new
york
of
boston
and
of
philadelphia
would
create
a
demand
for
literary
work
and
from
these
large
cities
his
message
to
the
world
would
go
out
with
greater
authority
than
from
a
small
town
like
richmond
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
he
finally
resolved
to
make
the
break
and
sent
in
his
resignation
to
the
in
the
three
years
since
his
first
appearance
in
its
columns
the
number
of
names
upon
its
subscription
list
had
increased
from
seven
hundred
to
five
thousand
though
edgar
poe
connection
with
the
magazine
as
editor
was
at
an
end
white
took
pains
to
announce
that
he
was
to
continue
to
be
a
regular
contributor
and
the
appearance
of
his
serial
story
arthur
gordon
pym
then
running
was
to
be
uninterrupted
it
was
a
far
cry
from
the
gardens
and
porches
and
open
houses
of
richmond
to
the
streets
of
new
york
from
the
easy
going
country
town
where
society
held
but
one
circle
to
a
city
with
its
locked
doors
and
its
wheels
within
wheels
indeed
the
single
circle
in
richmond
bound
together
as
it
was
by
the
elastic
but
secure
tie
of
virginia
cousinship
and
neighborliness
then
regarded
as
almost
the
same
thing
as
relationship
was
practically
one
big
family
whoever
was
not
your
cousin
or
your
neighbor
was
the
next
best
thing
either
your
cousin
or
your
cousin
neighbor
so
there
you
were
though
edgar
and
virginia
poe
and
the
widow
clemm
had
no
blood
kin
in
richmond
they
were
during
those
two
years
residence
there
taken
into
the
very
heart
of
this
pleasant
kindly
circle
and
it
was
with
keen
homesickness
that
they
realized
that
in
a
whole
cityful
friends
they
had
none
but
if
this
trio
of
dreamers
felt
strangely
out
of
place
in
the
streets
of
new
york
they
looked
more
so
as
they
sauntered
along
in
their
leisurely
southern
fashion
their
picturesque
appearance
arrested
the
gaze
of
many
a
hurrying
in
contrast
to
the
alert
crowd
upon
the
busy
streets
the
air
of
distinction
which
marked
them
everywhere
was
more
pronounced
than
ever
they
gave
the
impression
of
a
certain
exquisite
fineness
of
quality
combined
with
quaintness
that
one
is
sensible
of
in
looking
upon
rare
china
in
and
out
in
and
out
among
the
crowds
of
these
streets
where
being
a
stranger
he
felt
himself
peculiarly
alone
edgar
the
dreamer
walked
many
days
in
his
quest
for
work
here
there
and
everywhere
his
pale
face
and
solemn
eyes
with
less
and
less
of
hope
in
them
were
seen
he
had
been
right
in
believing
that
his
reputation
was
growing
and
had
reached
new
york
yet
no
one
wanted
his
work
the
supply
of
literature
exceeded
the
demand
he
was
told
everywhere
it
is
true
that
he
succeeded
in
placing
an
occasional
article
for
which
he
would
be
paid
the
merest
pittance
man
should
not
expect
to
live
by
writing
alone
he
found
to
be
the
general
opinion
he
should
have
a
business
or
profession
and
do
his
scribbling
in
the
hours
still
his
appearance
at
the
door
of
a
newspaper
magazine
or
book
publisher
office
accompanied
by
the
announcement
of
his
name
brought
him
respect
and
a
polite
hearing
if
that
could
afford
any
satisfaction
to
a
man
whose
darling
wife
was
growing
wan
from
insufficient
food
one
devoted
friend
he
and
his
family
made
in
gowans
a
scotchman
and
a
of
means
and
cultivation
whose
fancy
for
them
went
so
far
as
to
induce
him
to
become
a
member
of
the
unique
little
family
in
the
dingy
wooden
shanty
which
they
had
succeeded
in
renting
for
a
song
to
this
old
gentleman
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
something
of
a
crank
the
dreamer
conversation
and
virginia
beauty
and
exquisite
singing
were
wells
of
delight
while
the
generous
sum
that
he
paid
for
the
privilege
of
sharing
their
home
was
an
equal
benefit
to
them
and
went
a
long
way
toward
supplying
the
simple
table
the
little
checks
which
little
tom
white
sent
for
the
monthly
instalments
of
arthur
gordon
pym
upon
which
his
industriously
worked
were
also
most
welcome
but
with
all
they
could
scrape
together
the
income
was
insufficient
to
keep
three
souls
within
three
bodies
and
three
bodies
decently
covered
before
the
year
in
new
york
was
out
the
rainbow
was
pale
in
the
sky
its
colors
were
faded
and
its
end
was
invisible
obscured
by
lowering
clouds
at
the
moment
when
it
seemed
faintest
it
came
out
clear
again
this
time
setting
toward
philadelphia
whose
name
the
hope
that
rarely
left
him
for
long
at
a
time
whispered
in
the
dreamer
ear
why
not
philadelphia
philadelphia
then
the
acknowledged
seat
of
the
empire
of
letters
philadelphia
the
city
of
penn
the
city
of
brotherly
love
there
was
for
one
of
the
dreamer
superstitious
turn
of
mind
and
his
love
of
words
and
belief
in
their
power
an
attraction
a
significance
in
the
very
names
he
said
them
over
and
over
again
to
himself
rolled
them
on
his
tongue
fascinated
with
their
sound
and
with
their
suggestiveness
he
bade
virginia
and
muddie
keep
up
brave
hearts
for
they
would
turn
their
backs
upon
this
cold
inhospitable
new
york
and
set
up
their
household
gods
in
the
city
of
brotherly
love
the
city
of
penn
he
added
was
the
place
for
one
of
his
calling
laughing
as
he
spoke
at
the
feeble
pun
but
there
was
new
hope
and
life
in
the
laugh
in
city
even
if
disappointments
should
come
they
would
be
able
to
bear
them
for
how
should
human
beings
suffer
in
the
city
of
brotherly
love
chapter
xxiv
the
year
was
waning
the
year
when
edgar
poe
removed
his
family
from
new
york
about
the
hour
of
noon
upon
a
pleasant
day
of
the
spring
following
he
might
have
been
seen
to
turn
from
the
paved
streets
of
the
city
of
brotherly
love
and
to
enter
and
walk
briskly
along
a
grassy
thoroughfare
of
spring
garden
a
suburb
he
was
going
home
to
virginia
and
the
mother
to
a
new
home
in
this
village
which
they
had
been
first
tempted
to
explore
by
its
delightful
name
and
which
they
had
found
seeing
was
to
love
for
in
its
appearance
the
name
was
justified
the
quiet
streets
were
lined
with
trees
just
coming
into
leaf
in
which
birds
were
building
happy
and
unafraid
and
spring
flowers
were
blooming
in
little
plots
before
many
of
the
unpretentious
homes
the
place
also
possessed
a
more
practical
attraction
in
the
reasonableness
of
its
delightfully
low
was
the
price
asked
for
a
small
cottage
that
was
just
to
their
minds
it
was
small
yet
quite
large
enough
to
hold
the
three
and
their
modest
possessions
and
about
it
hung
a
quaint
charm
that
might
have
been
wanting
in
a
more
ambitious
abode
though
in
excellent
preservation
it
had
a
pleasantly
air
and
there
was
moss
in
velvety
green
patches
on
its
sloping
roof
it
was
set
somewhat
back
from
the
street
with
a
bit
of
garden
spot
in
front
of
it
in
whose
rich
soil
violets
and
single
hyacinths
blue
and
white
were
blooming
and
its
square
porch
supported
a
climbing
rose
heavy
with
buds
that
only
needed
training
to
make
it
a
bower
of
beauty
after
having
tried
several
more
or
less
unsatisfactory
homes
during
their
brief
residence
in
philadelphia
they
felt
that
they
had
at
last
found
one
that
filled
their
requirements
and
had
promptly
moved
in
there
were
no
servants
maids
would
have
been
in
the
way
they
happily
told
each
other
but
virginia
and
her
mother
had
positive
genius
for
neatness
and
order
at
their
touch
things
seemed
to
fly
by
magic
into
the
places
where
they
would
look
best
and
at
the
same
time
be
most
convenient
and
it
was
astonishing
how
quickly
the
arrangement
of
their
small
belongings
converted
the
cottage
into
a
home
it
was
with
light
heart
and
step
that
the
master
of
the
house
took
his
way
homeward
to
the
meal
the
periodicals
of
the
city
of
brotherly
love
were
keeping
him
busy
and
there
was
at
that
moment
money
in
his
pocket
not
much
but
still
it
was
money
that
day
received
for
his
latest
story
as
he
drew
near
a
corner
just
around
which
his
new
stood
he
stopped
suddenly
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
listens
peal
after
peal
of
rippling
laughter
was
filling
the
air
with
music
in
his
vivid
eyes
as
he
listened
shone
the
soft
light
of
love
and
a
smile
of
infinite
tenderness
played
about
his
lips
well
he
knew
from
what
lovely
girlish
throat
came
the
merry
sounds
sweet
and
clear
as
a
chime
of
silver
bells
a
quickened
step
brought
him
instantly
in
view
of
her
and
the
cause
of
her
mirth
she
stood
in
the
doorway
leaning
upon
a
broom
her
cheeks
were
pink
with
the
exertion
she
had
been
making
and
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
leaving
her
dimpled
white
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
her
soft
eyes
were
radiant
and
she
was
laughing
for
sheer
delight
in
the
picture
the
stately
muddie
made
the
palings
that
enclosed
the
wee
from
the
street
when
she
saw
her
husband
at
the
gate
she
dropped
her
broom
and
ran
into
his
arms
like
a
child
oh
buddie
buddie
she
cried
are
not
our
palings
beautiful
muddie
did
them
for
a
surprise
for
you
buddie
was
enthusiastic
in
admiration
of
the
white
palings
and
praised
the
gentle
to
the
skies
then
the
three
happy
workers
went
inside
to
their
simple
repast
which
the
sauce
of
content
turned
into
a
banquet
the
door
had
been
left
open
to
the
sunshine
and
the
result
was
an
unexpected
guest
a
handsome
kitten
which
strayed
in
to
ask
a
share
of
their
meal
she
paused
timidly
upon
the
threshold
for
a
moment
then
fixing
her
amber
eyes
upon
the
dreamer
made
straight
for
him
and
arching
her
back
and
waving
her
tail
like
a
plume
in
the
air
she
rubbed
her
glossy
sides
against
his
ankle
in
a
manner
that
was
truly
irresistible
all
three
gave
her
a
warm
welcome
edgar
regarded
her
appearance
as
a
good
omen
virginia
was
delighted
to
have
a
pet
and
catalina
as
they
named
her
became
from
the
moment
a
regular
and
favorite
member
of
the
family
the
cottage
contained
but
five
rooms
three
downstairs
including
the
kitchen
and
upstairs
two
with
shelving
walls
and
narrow
little
slits
of
windows
on
a
level
with
the
floor
but
as
has
been
said
it
was
large
enough
large
enough
to
shelter
love
and
happiness
and
genius
large
enough
to
hold
the
dream
of
the
valley
of
the
grass
with
its
fair
river
and
its
enchanted
trees
and
flowers
in
which
the
three
dreamers
lived
apart
and
for
each
other
only
it
was
large
enough
for
the
freest
expansion
the
world
had
yet
seen
of
the
imagination
of
edgar
poe
night
and
day
his
brain
was
busy
fancy
unto
fancy
linking
and
the
periodicals
teemed
with
his
work
in
american
of
baltimore
appeared
his
fantastic
ligeia
with
his
theory
of
the
power
of
the
human
will
for
a
text
his
favorite
of
all
of
his
tales
favorite
in
the
weakness
of
whose
own
will
lay
the
real
tragedy
of
his
life
in
of
philadelphia
appeared
a
little
later
the
dramatic
william
wilson
with
its
pictures
of
at
old
baltimore
gave
the
thrilling
fable
silence
to
the
world
the
weirdly
beautiful
haunted
palace
and
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
followed
in
quick
succession
in
american
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
brought
the
dreamer
a
back
from
little
tom
white
who
in
writing
of
the
tale
in
southern
literary
informed
the
world
we
always
predicted
that
poe
would
reach
a
high
grade
in
american
literature
only
we
wish
poe
would
stick
to
the
department
of
criticism
there
he
is
an
able
professor
wrote
james
russell
lowell
of
the
same
story
had
its
author
written
nothing
else
it
would
have
been
enough
to
stamp
him
as
a
man
of
genius
the
cottage
in
spring
garden
was
large
enough
too
for
the
sweet
uses
of
hospitality
by
the
time
the
roses
on
the
porch
were
open
friends
and
admirers
began
to
find
their
way
to
it
and
all
who
came
through
the
gate
and
sat
down
in
the
porch
or
passed
through
it
into
the
bright
and
tasteful
rooms
felt
the
poetic
charm
which
this
son
of
genius
and
his
exquisite
bit
of
a
wife
and
the
stately
mother
with
the
mater
dolorosa
expression
threw
over
their
simple
surroundings
among
those
who
found
their
way
thither
was
billy
burton
an
englishman
and
an
actor
who
though
a
graduate
of
cambridge
was
better
known
as
a
commedian
than
as
a
literary
man
he
had
written
several
books
however
and
was
the
publisher
of
gentleman
of
philadelphia
here
too
came
intimately
alexander
one
of
the
founders
of
saturday
evening
to
which
the
dreamer
was
a
frequent
contributor
and
clarke
first
editor
of
and
others
of
what
edgar
poe
friend
wilmer
would
have
dubbed
the
press
gang
of
philadelphia
to
be
intimate
with
the
dreamer
meant
to
adore
the
little
wife
with
the
face
of
a
luca
della
robbia
chorister
and
the
voice
which
should
have
belonged
to
one
with
the
merry
irresistible
ways
of
a
perfectly
happy
child
and
to
revere
the
mother
the
cottage
was
also
found
to
be
large
enough
as
the
fame
of
its
master
grew
to
be
the
destination
of
letters
from
the
literary
stars
of
the
day
longfellow
and
lowell
and
washington
irving
on
this
side
of
the
water
and
dickens
in
england
were
among
edgar
poe
numerous
correspondents
while
a
dweller
in
the
cottage
in
spring
garden
in
addition
to
the
stories
poems
essays
and
critiques
which
the
indefatigable
dreamer
was
putting
out
he
found
time
to
publish
a
collection
of
his
tales
of
the
grotesque
and
arabesque
in
book
form
he
was
also
unfortunately
for
him
induced
to
prepare
a
work
on
for
the
use
of
schools
the
conchologist
first
book
it
was
called
this
was
unmistakably
a
mere
and
confessedly
a
compilation
but
it
set
the
little
authors
whose
works
the
defender
of
the
purity
of
style
in
american
letters
had
consigned
to
an
early
grave
like
a
nest
of
hornets
buzzing
about
his
ears
plagarism
was
the
burden
of
their
hum
even
while
the
discordant
chorus
was
being
chanted
however
his
wonderfully
original
tales
continued
to
make
their
appearance
at
intervals
chiefly
in
gentleman
whose
editor
at
billy
burton
invitation
he
had
become
in
the
midst
of
all
this
activity
one
of
his
old
and
most
cherished
dreams
took
more
definite
shape
than
ever
before
the
dream
of
becoming
himself
the
founder
of
a
magazine
in
which
he
could
write
as
his
genius
and
his
fancy
should
dictate
without
having
to
be
constantly
making
compromises
with
editors
and
proprietors
a
periodical
which
would
fulfil
his
ideal
of
magazine
literature
which
he
predicted
would
be
the
leading
literature
of
the
future
with
his
prophetic
eye
he
foresaw
the
high
pressure
under
which
the
american
of
coming
years
would
live
and
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
express
the
opinion
that
the
reader
of
the
future
would
give
preference
to
the
essay
or
story
or
poem
which
could
be
read
at
a
sitting
which
would
waste
no
time
in
preamble
or
conclusion
but
in
which
every
word
would
be
chosen
by
the
literary
artist
with
the
nicety
with
which
the
painter
selects
the
exact
tint
he
needs
and
in
which
every
word
would
tell
and
such
works
he
conceived
it
would
be
especially
the
province
of
the
magazine
to
present
he
went
so
far
as
to
prepare
a
prospectus
and
advertise
for
subscribers
to
penn
as
he
proposed
naming
this
child
of
his
hopes
and
his
proposition
to
enter
the
field
of
magazine
publishing
not
only
as
an
editor
but
as
a
proprietor
bade
fair
to
be
the
rock
upon
which
he
and
his
friend
billy
burton
would
split
they
came
to
an
understanding
finally
however
for
when
burton
a
little
later
decided
to
abandon
gentleman
and
devote
himself
exclusively
to
the
theatre
he
said
to
george
graham
the
owner
of
to
whom
he
sold
out
by
the
way
graham
there
one
thing
i
want
to
ask
and
that
is
that
you
will
take
care
of
my
young
editor
edgar
poe
was
at
the
moment
lost
in
the
happy
dream
of
his
own
which
he
conceived
would
not
only
take
care
of
him
and
his
family
but
would
give
his
genius
free
rein
he
was
resolved
to
put
the
best
of
himself
into
it
and
the
best
of
outside
contributions
he
could
succeed
in
procuring
its
criticisms
should
be
sternly
just
guided
only
by
the
purest
rules
of
art
analyzing
and
urging
these
rules
as
it
applied
them
holding
itself
aloof
from
all
personal
bias
acknowledging
no
fear
save
that
of
outraging
the
right
it
would
endeavor
to
support
the
general
interests
of
the
republic
of
letters
regarding
the
world
at
large
as
the
true
audience
of
the
author
he
determined
and
he
declared
in
his
prospectus
dear
to
his
heart
as
was
this
dream
of
dreams
of
his
intellectual
life
he
was
soon
to
realize
that
its
fulfilment
was
not
to
be
at
least
not
yet
for
he
comforted
his
own
heart
and
virginia
and
muddie
with
the
assurance
that
it
was
but
a
case
of
hope
deferred
again
as
he
was
bracing
himself
for
this
fresh
disappointment
graham
the
purchaser
of
gentlemen
which
he
proposed
to
combine
with
in
the
creation
of
sat
in
his
office
with
a
paper
before
him
which
the
initiated
would
have
at
once
recognized
as
an
edgar
poe
manuscript
it
was
a
long
narrow
strip
formed
by
pasting
pages
together
endwise
and
had
been
submitted
in
a
tight
roll
which
graham
unrolled
as
he
read
the
title
at
the
top
of
the
strip
in
the
dreamer
neat
legible
handwriting
was
the
man
of
the
crowd
there
was
nothing
gruesome
about
graham
his
candid
brow
his
kindling
blue
eye
his
cheeks
the
genial
curve
of
his
lip
and
his
strong
but
amiable
chin
spoke
of
a
sunshiny
nature
with
neither
taste
nor
turn
for
the
weird
but
as
he
read
the
strange
moved
him
held
him
in
a
grip
of
intense
interest
wove
a
spell
around
him
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
original
material
undoubtedly
he
had
it
in
this
manuscript
he
recalled
billy
burton
last
words
to
him
take
care
of
my
young
editor
a
smile
lighted
his
pleasant
face
he
had
his
own
mental
endowments
generous
ones
and
without
the
least
conceit
he
knew
it
but
he
had
no
ambition
to
patronize
genius
the
writer
of
this
story
is
quite
able
to
take
care
of
himself
he
informed
his
inner
consciousness
and
if
i
can
only
form
a
connection
with
him
it
will
doubtless
be
a
case
of
the
young
editor
taking
care
of
me
upon
the
next
afternoon
graham
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
to
spring
garden
though
it
was
november
the
air
was
mild
and
the
sunshine
was
mellow
was
the
sky
always
so
blue
in
spring
garden
he
wondered
he
found
the
cottage
without
difficulty
for
he
had
obtained
minute
directions
the
roses
were
all
gone
but
the
foliage
was
still
green
and
the
little
garden
was
bright
with
the
flowers
of
autumn
flowers
and
cottage
stood
bathed
in
the
light
of
the
golden
afternoon
the
picture
of
serenity
what
marked
this
quaint
small
homestead
set
back
from
the
quiet
village
street
tucked
away
behind
its
from
the
din
of
the
world
what
made
it
different
from
others
of
its
neighborhood
and
character
was
it
just
a
notion
of
his
graham
wondered
that
made
him
feel
that
here
was
poetry
pure
and
simple
poetry
with
sensations
of
keen
interest
he
lifted
the
knocker
edgar
poe
himself
opened
the
door
and
his
captivating
smile
cordial
and
words
of
warm
as
well
as
courtly
greeting
raised
the
visitor
instantly
from
the
ranks
of
the
caller
to
the
place
of
a
friend
graham
had
met
edgar
poe
before
and
had
felt
his
charm
but
he
now
told
himself
that
to
know
him
one
must
see
him
under
his
own
roof
and
in
the
character
of
host
as
the
door
was
opened
a
flood
of
music
floated
out
a
divinely
sweet
voice
was
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
harp
as
the
master
of
the
house
flung
wide
the
door
and
announced
the
visitor
the
sounds
ceased
but
the
musician
sat
with
her
hands
resting
upon
the
gilded
strings
for
a
moment
her
eyes
turned
in
inquiry
toward
the
door
then
rose
and
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
came
forward
to
place
her
hand
in
that
of
graham
mother
clemm
who
sat
near
the
window
with
a
piece
of
sewing
in
her
lap
also
arose
and
with
gentle
dignity
came
forward
to
be
introduced
and
to
do
her
part
in
making
the
guest
welcome
as
he
took
the
seat
proffered
him
and
entered
upon
the
exchange
of
commonplace
phrases
with
which
a
visit
of
a
comparative
stranger
is
apt
to
begin
graham
blue
eyes
gathered
in
the
details
of
the
reposeful
picture
of
which
he
had
become
a
part
the
open
fire
the
sunshine
lying
on
the
bare
but
spotless
floor
the
vases
filled
with
flowers
the
few
simple
pieces
of
furniture
so
fitly
disposed
that
they
produced
a
sense
of
unusual
completeness
and
satisfaction
the
row
of
books
the
harp
the
cat
dosing
upon
the
hearth
and
finally
the
people
the
master
of
the
house
distinguished
handsome
dominant
genial
his
young
wife
the
embodiment
of
soft
poetic
beauty
and
the
mother
with
her
face
and
gentle
composed
manner
her
expressive
hands
busy
with
her
needle
work
was
it
possible
that
such
a
home
such
a
household
was
always
there
keeping
the
even
tenor
of
its
way
among
the
unpicturesque
conventions
of
the
modern
world
after
the
first
formalities
had
been
exchanged
he
had
delicately
intimated
that
he
had
come
on
business
but
he
soon
began
to
see
that
whatever
his
business
might
be
it
was
to
be
dispatched
right
there
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
this
was
irregular
and
unusual
yet
somehow
it
did
not
seem
unnatural
and
he
found
that
the
presence
of
the
women
of
the
poet
household
was
not
the
least
restraint
upon
the
freedom
of
their
discussion
after
some
words
of
commendation
of
the
story
the
man
of
the
crowd
which
he
accepted
for
the
next
number
of
his
magazine
he
came
to
the
real
business
of
the
afternoon
poe
said
he
i
believe
you
know
that
with
the
new
year
gentleman
and
will
be
combined
to
form
which
it
is
my
intention
to
make
the
best
monthly
in
contributed
articles
and
editorial
opinion
in
this
country
poe
i
want
an
editor
capable
of
making
it
this
want
what
do
you
say
to
undertaking
it
as
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dreamer
eyes
waiting
for
an
answer
he
could
not
see
the
quick
clasping
of
the
widow
hands
the
uplifting
of
her
expressive
face
which
plainly
said
thank
god
or
the
sudden
illumination
in
the
soft
eyes
of
virginia
but
the
transformation
in
the
beautiful
face
of
the
man
before
him
held
him
edgar
poe
great
eyes
were
glowing
with
sudden
pleasure
the
curves
of
his
mouth
grew
sweet
his
whole
countenance
softened
this
is
very
good
of
you
graham
he
said
his
low
musical
voice
warm
with
feeling
your
offer
places
me
upon
firm
ground
once
more
to
be
frank
with
you
the
failure
through
lack
of
capital
of
my
attempt
to
establish
a
magazine
of
my
own
since
the
severing
of
my
connection
with
burton
which
gave
me
my
only
regular
income
has
left
me
hanging
by
the
eyelids
as
it
were
and
i
have
been
wondering
how
long
i
could
hold
on
with
only
the
small
irregular
sums
coming
in
from
the
sale
of
my
stories
to
depend
upon
your
offer
at
this
time
means
more
to
me
than
i
can
express
his
stole
to
his
side
and
with
pretty
grace
unembarrassed
by
the
presence
of
graham
leaned
over
his
chair
and
pressed
her
lips
upon
his
brow
but
you
know
buddie
she
murmured
in
a
voice
that
was
like
a
dove
i
always
told
you
something
would
come
along
darkness
fell
and
lamps
were
lighted
and
still
graham
sat
on
and
on
as
though
too
fascinated
by
the
charm
of
the
little
circle
to
move
to
his
own
surprise
he
found
himself
accepting
the
invitation
to
remain
to
supper
the
simple
table
was
beautiful
with
the
dainty
touch
of
mother
clemm
and
virginia
and
the
very
frugality
of
the
meal
seemed
a
virtue
after
supper
his
host
not
the
least
of
whose
accomplishments
was
the
rare
one
of
reading
aloud
acceptably
was
persuaded
to
read
some
of
his
own
poems
graham
asking
for
certain
special
pieces
among
these
were
the
lines
to
helen
which
were
recited
with
a
fervor
approaching
solemnity
tell
him
about
helen
eddie
murmured
virginia
who
sat
by
his
side
yes
do
tell
me
urged
graham
quickly
and
with
his
eyes
brooding
and
dreamy
the
poet
went
over
in
touching
and
beautiful
words
the
story
of
what
he
always
felt
and
declared
to
be
the
first
pure
passion
of
his
soul
in
the
silence
that
followed
he
arose
and
took
from
the
wall
a
small
picture
a
of
a
lovely
head
this
is
a
drawing
of
her
made
by
myself
he
said
it
was
done
from
memory
but
is
a
good
likeness
i
needed
no
sitting
to
make
her
likeness
when
he
had
shown
graham
the
picture
he
hung
it
back
in
its
place
and
a
gentle
hush
fell
upon
the
little
group
speech
seemed
out
of
place
after
the
moving
recital
and
the
four
sat
gazing
into
the
embers
each
sunk
in
his
or
her
own
dreams
the
poet
was
the
first
to
speak
some
music
sissy
he
said
turning
to
virginia
i
want
graham
to
hear
you
she
arose
at
once
and
seating
herself
at
the
harp
struck
some
soft
chords
while
she
waited
for
buddie
to
decide
what
she
should
sing
let
it
be
something
sweet
and
low
he
said
and
simple
something
of
tom
moore
for
instance
you
know
my
theory
anything
but
the
simplest
music
to
be
appreciated
to
reach
the
soul
must
be
heard
alone
the
harp
accompaniment
rippled
forth
and
in
a
moment
more
melted
into
the
rich
sweet
passionate
tones
of
her
voice
as
she
told
in
musical
numbers
a
story
of
love
and
parting
ballad
after
ballad
followed
while
the
little
audience
sat
entranced
finally
when
the
singer
returned
to
her
seat
by
the
side
of
her
husband
the
conversation
turned
upon
music
graham
commented
upon
his
theory
that
all
music
but
the
simplest
should
for
its
best
effect
be
listened
to
in
solitude
yes
said
the
dreamer
it
is
like
the
happiness
felt
in
the
contemplation
of
natural
scenery
much
enhanced
by
seclusion
the
man
who
would
behold
aright
the
glory
of
god
as
expressed
in
dark
valleys
gray
rocks
waters
that
silently
smile
and
forests
that
sigh
in
uneasy
slumbers
and
the
proud
watchful
mountains
that
look
down
upon
all
the
man
that
would
not
only
look
upon
these
with
his
natural
eye
but
feed
his
soul
upon
them
as
a
sacrament
must
do
so
in
solitude
and
so
too
i
hold
should
one
listen
to
the
deep
harmonies
of
music
of
the
highest
class
at
length
the
hour
came
when
graham
felt
that
he
must
tear
himself
away
bring
this
strange
visit
to
an
end
before
going
he
felt
moved
by
an
impulse
to
express
something
of
the
effect
it
had
had
upon
him
poe
he
said
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
one
of
the
most
delightful
evenings
of
my
life
and
for
having
taken
me
into
the
heart
of
your
home
i
can
find
no
words
in
which
to
express
my
appreciation
tonight
at
your
fireside
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
had
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
clear
understanding
of
the
word
happiness
edgar
poe
smiled
dreamily
why
should
we
not
be
happy
here
he
answered
concerning
happiness
my
dear
graham
i
have
a
little
creed
of
my
own
if
i
could
only
persuade
others
to
adopt
it
there
would
be
more
happy
people
far
more
contented
ones
in
the
world
and
the
articles
of
your
creed
queried
graham
are
only
four
first
free
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
plenty
of
it
this
brings
health
which
is
a
kind
of
happiness
in
itself
that
attainable
by
any
other
means
is
scarcely
worth
the
name
second
love
of
woman
i
need
not
tell
you
that
my
life
fulfils
that
condition
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
ineffable
tenderness
wandered
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
involuntarily
in
the
direction
of
his
wife
the
third
condition
is
contempt
for
ambition
would
that
i
could
tell
you
that
i
have
attained
to
that
when
i
do
there
will
be
little
in
this
world
to
be
desired
by
me
the
fourth
and
last
is
an
object
of
unceasing
pursuit
this
is
the
most
important
of
all
for
i
believe
that
the
extent
of
one
happiness
is
in
proportion
to
the
spirituality
of
this
object
in
this
i
am
especially
fortunate
for
no
more
elevating
pursuit
exists
i
think
than
that
of
systematically
endeavoring
to
bring
to
its
highest
perfection
the
art
of
literature
i
notice
you
do
not
mention
money
in
your
creed
remarked
his
guest
no
neither
do
i
mention
air
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
essential
to
life
and
to
the
keeping
together
of
body
and
soul
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
necessities
of
life
are
necessary
to
happiness
but
money
meaning
wealth
while
it
makes
indulgence
in
pleasures
possible
has
nothing
to
do
with
happiness
indeed
the
very
pleasure
it
ensures
often
obscure
highest
happiness
the
happiness
of
exaltation
of
the
soul
of
exercise
of
the
intellect
what
has
money
to
do
with
happiness
it
is
a
happiness
to
wonder
it
is
a
happiness
to
dream
your
rich
man
or
woman
is
too
deeply
embedded
in
flesh
and
sense
to
do
either
no
he
mused
his
eyes
on
the
glowing
coals
in
the
grate
no
i
have
no
desire
for
wealth
for
more
than
enough
money
to
keep
my
wife
and
mother
comfortable
they
like
myself
have
learned
the
lesson
of
being
poor
and
happy
but
i
keep
them
above
want
i
keep
them
above
want
as
he
repeated
the
words
the
meditative
mood
dropped
from
him
he
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
with
sudden
energy
his
voice
trembled
and
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
in
place
of
the
dreamy
look
his
eyes
flamed
with
passion
graham
he
exclaimed
to
see
those
you
love
better
than
your
own
soul
in
want
and
in
spite
of
working
like
mad
to
be
powerless
to
raise
them
out
of
it
is
hell
a
second
time
the
exquisite
slipped
quickly
noiselessly
to
his
side
and
with
the
same
easy
grace
leaned
over
and
touched
his
brow
with
her
lips
but
this
time
instead
of
moving
away
remained
hanging
over
the
back
of
his
chair
her
fair
hand
gently
toying
with
the
ringlets
on
his
brow
he
was
calm
in
an
instant
i
mean
of
course
such
a
condition
would
be
intolerable
provided
it
should
ever
exist
he
added
as
the
visitor
stepped
from
the
cottage
door
into
the
chill
of
the
bright
november
night
and
made
his
way
down
the
little
path
of
flagstones
irregularly
shaped
and
clumsily
laid
down
so
that
mossy
turf
which
was
still
green
appeared
between
them
he
felt
that
he
was
stepping
back
into
a
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
world
from
one
of
the
enchanted
regions
out
of
space
out
of
time
of
poe
own
creation
he
had
indeed
had
a
revelation
of
harmonious
such
as
he
had
not
guessed
existed
in
a
world
of
the
music
the
poetry
of
living
he
had
had
a
glimpse
into
the
valley
of
the
grass
chapter
xxv
the
next
morning
found
graham
still
under
the
spell
of
the
evening
with
the
poes
he
caught
himself
impatiently
watching
the
clock
for
the
man
under
whose
charm
he
had
come
was
to
call
at
a
certain
hour
to
confer
with
him
in
regard
to
the
magazine
he
could
hear
him
coming
stepping
briskly
and
whistling
a
moore
melody
before
the
rap
upon
the
door
announced
him
he
came
in
with
the
bright
alert
air
of
a
man
ready
for
action
for
which
he
has
appetite
his
rarely
heard
laugh
rang
out
fresh
and
spontaneous
several
times
during
the
interview
his
manners
were
at
all
times
those
of
a
prince
but
graham
had
never
seen
him
so
genial
so
gay
the
mantle
of
dreamer
and
poet
had
suddenly
dropped
from
him
but
the
new
mood
had
a
charm
all
its
own
when
business
had
been
dispatched
and
they
sat
on
to
finish
their
cigars
graham
reiterated
his
expressions
of
pleasure
in
his
visit
of
the
evening
before
you
gave
me
food
for
thought
poe
said
he
i
been
pondering
on
that
creed
of
yours
for
finding
and
keeping
the
secret
of
true
happiness
it
is
about
the
most
wholesome
and
sane
doctrine
i
met
with
for
some
time
i
determined
to
adopt
it
and
to
at
least
endeavor
to
practice
it
his
companion
smiled
good
said
he
i
only
hope
you
have
better
success
in
living
up
to
it
than
i
have
graham
eyebrows
went
up
i
thought
that
was
just
what
you
did
was
his
answer
so
it
is
at
times
but
when
the
blues
or
the
imp
of
the
perverse
get
hold
of
me
all
my
philosophy
goes
to
the
devil
and
i
realize
what
an
arch
humbug
i
am
the
imp
of
the
perverse
questioned
graham
that
is
my
name
for
the
principle
that
lies
hidden
in
weak
human
nature
the
principle
of
antagonism
to
happiness
which
with
unholy
impishness
tempts
man
to
his
own
destruction
do
you
think
it
an
apt
name
i
do
believe
i
follow
you
then
let
me
explain
did
you
never
when
standing
upon
some
high
point
become
conscious
of
an
influence
irresistibly
urging
you
to
cast
yourself
down
as
you
listened
fascinated
and
horrified
to
the
voice
did
you
not
feel
an
almost
overwhelming
curiosity
to
see
what
the
sensations
accompanying
such
a
fall
would
be
to
know
the
extremest
terror
of
it
your
tempter
was
the
of
the
did
you
never
feel
a
sense
of
glee
to
find
that
something
you
had
said
or
done
had
shocked
someone
whose
good
opinion
you
should
have
desired
did
you
never
feel
a
desire
to
depart
from
a
course
you
knew
to
be
to
your
interest
and
follow
one
that
would
bring
certain
harm
possible
disaster
upon
you
did
you
never
feel
like
breaking
loose
from
all
the
restraints
which
you
knew
to
be
for
your
good
throwing
off
every
shackle
of
propriety
and
right
and
decency
mr
graham
did
you
never
feel
like
throwing
yourself
to
the
devil
for
no
reason
at
all
other
than
the
desire
to
be
perverse
could
any
desire
be
more
impish
i
will
illustrate
by
my
own
case
i
am
in
one
respect
not
like
other
men
an
exceptionally
nervous
temperament
makes
alcoholic
stimulants
poison
to
me
it
works
like
madness
in
my
brain
and
in
my
blood
the
glass
of
wine
that
you
can
take
with
pleasure
and
perhaps
with
benefit
drives
me
wild
makes
me
commit
all
manner
of
reckless
deeds
that
in
my
sane
moments
fill
me
with
sorrow
and
sometimes
produces
physical
illness
followed
by
depression
of
spirits
horrible
in
the
extreme
more
an
inherited
desire
for
stimulation
and
the
exhilaration
produced
by
wine
makes
it
well
nigh
impossible
for
me
once
i
have
yielded
my
will
so
far
as
to
take
the
single
glass
to
resist
the
second
which
is
more
than
apt
to
be
followed
by
a
third
and
so
on
i
am
fully
aware
therefore
of
the
danger
that
lies
for
me
in
a
thing
harmless
to
many
men
and
that
my
only
safety
and
happiness
and
the
happiness
of
those
far
dearer
to
me
than
myself
lies
in
the
strictest
most
rigid
abstinence
knowing
all
this
one
would
suppose
that
i
would
fly
from
this
temptation
as
it
were
the
plague
i
do
generally
at
present
several
years
have
passed
since
i
yielded
an
inch
but
there
have
been
times
and
there
may
be
times
again
when
the
imp
of
the
perverse
will
command
me
to
drink
and
fully
aware
of
the
risk
i
drink
and
will
go
down
into
hell
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
afterward
during
this
lecture
upon
one
of
his
favorite
hobbies
the
low
voice
of
the
dreamer
was
vibrant
with
earnestness
he
spoke
out
of
bitter
experience
and
as
he
who
bore
the
reputation
of
a
reserved
man
laid
his
soul
bare
his
vivid
eyes
held
the
eyes
of
his
companion
by
the
very
intensity
the
deep
sincerity
of
their
gaze
graham
last
conversation
with
his
new
editor
had
dazed
him
this
one
dazed
him
still
more
what
manner
of
man
was
this
he
asked
himself
with
whom
he
had
formed
a
league
he
could
not
say
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
undoubtedly
original
and
interesting
admirable
qualities
for
an
editor
both
the
readers
of
the
new
monthly
thoroughly
agreed
with
him
the
history
of
edgar
poe
career
as
editor
of
southern
literary
promptly
began
to
repeat
itself
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
been
engaged
as
editor
immediately
drew
the
attention
of
the
reading
world
toward
and
it
soon
became
apparent
that
in
the
new
position
he
was
going
to
himself
the
rapidity
with
which
his
brilliant
and
caustic
critiques
and
essays
and
weird
stories
followed
upon
the
heels
of
one
another
was
enough
to
take
one
breath
away
he
alternately
raised
the
hair
of
his
readers
with
of
unearthly
imaginings
and
diverted
them
with
playful
studies
in
autography
and
exhibitions
of
skill
in
reading
secret
writing
about
the
time
of
his
beginning
his
duties
at
he
must
needs
have
had
a
visit
from
some
fairy
godmother
the
touch
of
whose
enchanted
wand
left
him
with
a
new
gift
this
was
a
wonderfully
developed
power
of
analysis
which
he
found
pleasure
in
exercising
in
every
possible
way
to
quote
his
own
words
as
the
strong
man
exults
in
his
physical
ability
delighting
in
such
exercises
as
bring
his
muscles
into
action
so
glories
the
analyst
in
that
moral
activity
which
disentangles
he
derives
pleasure
from
even
the
most
trivial
occupations
bringing
his
talent
into
play
he
tried
the
newly
discovered
talent
upon
everything
in
his
papers
on
autography
he
practised
it
in
the
reading
of
character
from
and
in
his
deciphering
of
secret
writing
he
carried
it
so
far
and
awakened
the
interest
and
curiosity
of
the
public
to
such
extent
that
it
bade
fair
to
be
the
ruin
of
him
for
it
seemed
his
correspondents
would
have
him
drop
literature
and
devote
himself
and
the
columns
of
for
the
rest
of
his
life
to
the
solving
of
these
puzzles
finally
having
proved
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
them
to
compose
a
cypher
he
could
not
read
in
less
time
than
its
author
had
spent
in
inventing
it
he
took
advantage
of
his
only
safeguard
and
positively
declined
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
them
but
he
found
a
much
more
interesting
way
of
exercising
his
power
of
analysis
in
the
april
number
of
he
tried
it
upon
a
story
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
which
set
all
the
world
buzzing
and
drew
the
interested
attention
of
france
upon
him
in
the
next
number
while
the
murders
were
still
the
talk
of
the
hour
he
made
an
excursion
into
the
world
of
the
result
of
which
was
his
thrilling
descent
into
the
maelstrom
but
later
in
the
same
month
he
returned
to
his
experiments
in
analysis
publishing
in
saturday
evening
an
review
of
charles
dickens
story
barnaby
rudge
which
was
just
beginning
to
come
out
in
serial
form
in
the
review
he
predicted
correctly
the
whole
development
and
conclusion
of
the
story
it
brought
him
a
letter
from
dickens
expressing
astonishment
owning
that
the
plot
was
correct
and
enquiring
if
edgar
poe
had
dealings
with
the
devil
soon
followed
the
colloquy
of
monos
and
una
in
which
in
the
exquisite
prose
poetry
of
which
the
dreamer
was
a
consummate
master
his
imagination
sought
to
pierce
the
veil
between
this
world
and
the
next
to
lay
bare
the
secrets
of
the
soul
passage
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
whatever
else
edgar
poe
wrote
he
continued
to
pour
out
through
the
editorial
columns
of
a
steady
stream
of
criticism
of
current
books
while
entertaining
or
amusing
the
public
as
far
as
power
to
do
so
in
him
lay
he
did
not
for
a
moment
permit
anything
to
come
between
him
and
the
duties
of
his
post
as
defender
of
purity
of
style
in
american
letters
he
was
unsparing
in
the
use
of
his
pruning
hook
upon
the
work
of
his
contemporaries
and
the
height
of
art
to
which
by
his
fearless
candid
and
at
times
cruel
criticism
he
sought
to
bring
others
he
exacted
of
himself
in
spite
of
the
amount
of
work
he
produced
each
sentence
that
dropped
from
his
pen
in
this
time
of
his
maturity
his
ripeness
was
the
perfection
of
clear
and
polished
english
but
the
evidences
of
this
conscientiousness
in
his
own
work
did
not
make
the
little
authors
one
whit
less
sore
under
his
lash
privately
they
writhed
and
they
squirmed
publicly
they
denounced
all
save
one
an
rufus
griswold
himself
a
critic
of
ability
who
would
like
to
have
been
like
the
dreamer
a
poet
as
well
as
a
critic
when
edgar
poe
praised
the
prose
writings
of
griswold
but
said
he
was
no
poet
griswold
like
the
other
little
authors
writhed
and
squirmed
secretly
very
secretly
but
openly
he
smiled
and
in
smooth
easy
words
professed
friendship
for
poe
and
bided
his
time
as
for
poe
himself
he
had
by
close
and
devoted
study
of
the
rules
which
govern
poetic
and
prose
composition
rules
which
he
evolved
for
himself
by
analysis
of
the
work
of
the
masters
so
added
to
his
own
natural
gifts
of
imagination
and
power
of
expression
so
perfected
his
taste
that
crude
writing
was
disgusting
to
his
literary
palate
he
had
made
literature
his
intellectual
mistress
and
from
the
day
he
had
declared
his
allegiance
to
her
he
had
served
her
faithfully
passionately
and
he
could
brook
no
flagging
service
in
others
both
his
growing
power
of
analysis
and
his
highly
developed
artistic
feeling
were
brought
into
full
play
in
this
review
work
under
his
guidance
the
writings
of
his
contemporaries
whether
they
were
the
little
authors
or
the
giants
such
as
in
england
tennyson
who
was
a
prime
favorite
with
him
macauley
dickens
elizabeth
barrett
or
in
america
longfellow
lowell
hawthorne
irving
emerson
stood
forth
illumined
the
weak
spots
laid
bare
the
strong
points
gleaming
bright
he
unfalteringly
declared
his
admiration
of
hawthorne
then
almost
unknown
in
which
the
future
so
fully
justified
him
the
tales
of
hawthorne
he
declared
belonged
to
the
highest
region
of
art
an
art
subservient
to
genius
of
a
very
lofty
order
even
the
work
of
the
little
authors
was
indebted
to
him
for
many
a
good
word
but
the
little
authors
hated
him
and
returned
the
brilliant
sallies
his
pungent
pen
directed
toward
their
writings
with
vollies
of
mud
aimed
at
his
private
character
no
matter
what
his
subject
however
edgar
poe
always
wrote
with
power
with
intensity
he
seemed
by
turns
to
dip
his
pen
into
fire
into
gall
into
vitriol
at
times
into
his
own
heart
blood
of
the
last
named
type
was
the
story
eleonora
which
appeared
not
in
but
in
for
the
new
year
and
wherein
was
set
forth
in
phrases
like
strung
jewels
the
story
of
the
valley
of
the
grass
the
whole
fabric
of
this
loveliest
of
his
conceptions
is
like
a
web
wrought
in
some
fairy
loom
of
bright
strands
of
silk
of
every
hue
and
studded
with
fairest
gems
in
it
is
no
hint
of
the
gruesome
or
the
sombre
even
though
the
angel
of
death
is
there
it
is
all
pure
beauty
a
perfect
flower
from
the
fruitful
tree
of
his
genius
at
the
height
of
its
power
all
of
edgar
poe
work

much
by
being
read
aloud
for
the
eye
alone
can
not
fully
grasp
the
music
that
is
in
his
prose
as
well
as
his
verse
eleonora
was
read
aloud
in
every
city
and
hamlet
of
the
united
states
and
at
firesides
far
from
the
beaten
paths
the
traveled
roads
that
led
to
the
cities
for
it
was
written
when
every
word
from
the
pen
of
edgar
poe
was
looked
for
waited
for
with
eager
impatience
and
when
had
been
made
in
one
little
year
by
his
writing
and
the
writing
of
others
whom
he
had
induced
to
contribute
to
its
pages
to
lead
the
thought
of
the
day
in
america
and
the
success
of
the
dreamer
made
him
a
lion
in
the
city
of
brotherly
love
as
it
had
made
him
a
lion
in
richmond
the
doors
of
the
most
exclusive
the
most
cultivated
homes
of
that
fastidious
city
stood
open
to
welcome
him
the
loveliest
women
whether
the
grey
ladies
of
the
society
of
friends
or
the
brightly
plumaged
birds
of
the
gayer
world
smiled
their
sweetest
upon
him
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
would
whisper
to
one
another
there
goes
poe
did
you
notice
his
eyes
they
say
he
has
the
most
expressive
eyes
in
philadelphia
throughout
this
year
of
almost
dazzling
triumph
the
little
cottage
with
its
porch
in
spring
garden
had
been
a
veritable
snug
harbor
to
the
dreamer
in
winter
when
the
deep
spotless
snow
lay
round
about
it
in
spring
when
the
violets
and
hyacinths
came
back
to
the
and
the
singing
birds
to
the
trees
that
overhung
it
in
summer
when
the
climbing
green
rose
was
heavy
with
bloom
and
in
autumn
when
the
wind
whistled
around
it
but
there
was
a
bright
blaze
upon
the
hearth
inside
his
heart
turned
joyously
many
times
a
day
and
his
feet
at
eventide
when
his
work
at
the
office
in
the
city
was
over
toward
this
sacred
haven
and
edgar
the
dreamer
was
happy
he
should
have
been
rich
and
would
have
been
but
for
the
meagre
returns
from
literary
work
in
his
time
men
were
then
supposed
to
write
for
fame
and
very
little
money
was
deemed
sufficient
reward
for
the
best
work
the
poverty
of
authors
was
proverbial
and
to
starve
cheerfully
was
supposed
to
be
part
of
being
one
still
with
his
post
as
editor
of
and
the
frequency
with
which
his
signature
was
seen
in
other
magazines
he
was
making
a
living
the
howl
of
the
wolf
or
his
sickening
scratching
at
the
door
were
no
more
heard
and
in
the
valley
of
the
grass
the
three
dreamers
laughed
together
and
in
the
streets
of
the
city
of
brotherly
love
edgar
goodfellow
whistled
a
gay
air
or
arm
in
arm
with
some
boon
companion
of
the
press
gang
threaded
his
way
in
and
out
among
of
the
human
stream
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
the
light
of
gladness
in
living
in
his
eyes
and
why
should
he
not
be
happy
he
asked
himself
he
had
the
snuggest
little
home
in
the
world
and
in
it
the
loveliest
little
wife
in
the
world
and
the
dearest
mother
in
the
world
he
was
upon
the
top
of
the
wave
of
prosperity
his
fame
was
growing
had
already
reached
france
where
the
murders
were
still
being
talked
about
why
should
he
not
be
happy
his
devils
had
ceased
to
plague
him
this
long
while
the
blues
he
was
becoming
a
stranger
to
them
the
imp
he
had
not
had
a
single
glimpse
of
him
during
the
year
he
was
temperate
ah
therein
lay
man
safety
and
happiness
by
strict
abstinence
his
capacity
for
enjoyment
was
exalted
purified
he
would
let
the
cup
forever
alone
upon
that
he
was
resolved
this
was
not
always
easy
sometimes
it
had
been
exceedingly
hard
and
there
had
been
a
fierce
battle
between
himself
and
the
call
that
was
in
his
blood
the
thirst
not
for
the
stuff
itself
but
for
its
effects
for
the
excitement
the
exhilaration
but
he
had
won
every
time
and
he
felt
stronger
for
the
battle
and
for
the
victory
the
victory
of
will
man
doth
not
yield
himself
to
the
angels
or
to
death
utterly
he
quoted
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
feeble
will
upon
continued
resistence
continued
victory
he
was
resolved
and
in
the
resolution
he
was
happy
best
of
all
virginia
was
happy
and
muddie
dear
patient
muddie
the
two
women
chatted
like
magpies
over
their
sewing
or
or
as
they
watered
the
flowers
they
like
himself
had
made
friends
neighbors
dropped
in
to
chat
with
them
or
to
borrow
a
pattern
or
to
hear
virginia
sing
and
they
had
had
a
long
visit
from
the
eliza
white
what
a
pleasure
it
had
been
to
have
the
sweet
fair
creature
with
them
he
little
guessed
how
tremulously
happy
the
little
eliza
had
been
to
bask
for
a
time
in
his
presence
just
to
be
near
the
great
man
and
meanwhile
guard
all
the
more
diligently
the
secret
that
filled
her
white
soul
and
kept
her
for
all
her
beauty
and
charm
and
her
many
suitors
a
spinster
eliza
had
brought
them
a
great
budget
of
richmond
news
it
had
been
like
a
breath
of
spring
to
hear
it
she
talked
and
they
listened
and
they
all
laughed
together
from
pure
joy
how
virginia
laugh
had
rippled
out
upon
the
air
it
filled
all
the
cottage
with
music
it
was
and
he
sat
gazing
into
the
heart
of
the
open
coal
fire
going
over
it
all
the
whole
brilliant
full
year
sissy
he
said
suddenly
do
you
remember
the
birthday
parties
i
used
to
tell
you
about
that
i
had
given
me
when
i
was
a
boy
living
with
the
allans
yes
indeed
and
the
cake
with
candles
on
it
and
all
your
best
friends
to
wish
you
many
happy
returns
well
you
know
the
nineteenth
will
be
my
birthday
and
i
want
to
have
a
party
and
a
cake
with
candles
and
all
our
best
friends
here
to
wish
you
and
me
many
happy
returns
of
the
happiest
birthday
we
have
spent
together
i
only
wish
old
cy
were
here
to
play
for
us
to
dance
i
give
something
pretty
to
have
him
and
his
fiddle
here
just
to
see
what
these
penn
folk
would
think
of
them
my
would
they
make
a
sensation
in
the
of
brotherly
love
he
began
whistling
as
clearly
and
correctly
as
a
piccolo
the
air
of
a
recently
published
waltz
after
a
few
bars
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
still
whistling
quickly
shoved
the
table
and
chairs
to
the
wall
clearing
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
tune
stopped
long
enough
for
him
to
say
come
sweetheart
you
must
dance
this
with
me
my
feet
refuse
to
be
still
tonight
then
was
taken
up
again
the
beautiful
girl
was
in
his
arms
in
an
instant
and
while
muddie
in
her
seat
by
the
window
lifted
her
deep
eyes
from
the
work
in
her
hands
and
let
them
rest
with
a
smile
of
indulgent
bliss
upon
her
children
they
glided
round
and
round
the
room
to
the
time
of
the
fascinating
new
dance
at
length
they
stopped
breathless
and
rosy
and
the
poet
with
elaborate
ceremony
handed
his
fair
partner
to
a
chair
and
began
fanning
her
with
muddie
fan
he
was
in
a
glow
of
warmth
and
pleasure
his
wonderful
eyes
shone
like
lamps
his
pale
cheeks
were
tinged
with
faint
pink
while
fanning
virginia
with
one
hand
he
gently
mopped
the
pleasant
moisture
from
his
brow
with
the
other
eyes
shot
sunshine
her
laughter
bubbled
up
like
a
of
pure
joy
what
would
people
say
if
they
could
see
the
great
poe
the
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
poe
the
author
of
of
the
grotesque
and
arabesque
who
supposed
to
be
continually
from
his
condor
wings
invisible
woe
said
she
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
the
idea
was
so
vastly
amusing
to
her
that
she
laughed
until
the
shining
eyes
were
filled
with
dew
if
they
could
know
half
the
pleasure
i
got
out
of
that
they
say
anything
he
replied
they
would
be
dumb
with
envy
i
suppose
my
mother
in
me
but
i
just
dance
sometimes
and
this
waltz
in
spite
of
all
the
prudes
say
against
it
it
is
the
divinest
thing
in
the
way
of
motion
that
ever
was
invented
it
exercise
fit
for
the
gods
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
and
her
lips
it
was
heavenly
heavenly
sis
said
he
and
i
do
suppose
even
the
prudes
could
object
to
a
man
waltzing
with
his
own
wife
i
wonder
will
we
ever
dance
to
old
cy
fiddle
again
chapter
xxvi
it
was
a
very
modest
party
but
a
merry
one
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
unsullied
whiteness
of
snow
and
the
coming
of
most
of
the
guests
was
heralded
by
the
tintinnabulation
of
the
little
silver
bells
so
charming
to
the
ear
of
the
host
the
grahams
were
among
the
first
to
be
welcomed
out
of
the
frosty
night
into
the
glow
of
lamp
and
candle
and
firelight
by
the
cordial
hand
and
voice
of
edgar
goodfellow
graham
was
in
tune
to
most
heartily
take
part
in
the
commemoration
of
the
birthday
of
the
man
who
was
making
the
success
of
the
publishing
world
in
america
his
kindling
blue
eyes
had
never
been
kinder
his
smile
never
more
bland
alexander
founder
of
saturday
evening
which
so
gladly
published
and
paid
for
everything
that
edgar
poe
would
spare
it
from
was
the
next
and
close
following
him
cottrell
clarke
first
editor
of
the
and
his
charming
wife
captain
and
mayne
reid
who
were
among
the
most
admiring
and
affectionate
friends
of
the
poe
trio
were
also
there
and
other
congenial
spirits
they
came
in
twos
and
threes
their
laughter
as
light
and
clear
as
the
tinkle
of
their
and
rufus
griswold
was
there
the
dreamer
with
his
deep
reverence
for
intellectual
ability
had
a
sincere
admiration
for
griswold
though
he
did
say
he
was
no
poet
he
desired
the
approval
the
friendship
of
this
brainy
man
and
was
proud
and
happy
to
have
him
of
his
party
coming
in
after
the
rest
of
the
company
had
assembled
the
brainy
big
frame
topped
by
his
big
head
with
his
prominent
brow
and
piercing
eyes
his
straight
thick
nose
his
large
mouth
his
square
jaw
with
the
fringe
of
beard
sharply
outlining
it
produced
a
decided
effect
he
seemed
to
fill
up
a
surprisingly
large
portion
of
the
room
instinctively
the
gentleman
who
had
occupied
the
largest
and
heaviest
chair
vacated
it
and
invited
him
to
be
seated
in
it
which
he
did
instinctively
he
was
a
young
man
under
thirty
but
looked
much
older
his
face
was
a
strange
one
it
could
not
have
been
called
ugly
by
some
indeed
it
was
considered
handsome
it
was
strong
but
it
was
strange
there
was
an
indefinable
something
unpleasant
something
to
awaken
distrust
fear
about
it
across
the
dome
of
the
brow
ran
horizontally
a
series
of
wavy
furrows
that
produced
in
place
of
the
benevolent
air
the
lofty
brow
might
have
given
a
sinister
expression
the
eyes
beneath
the
wrinkled
brow
were
piercing
and
spoke
of
the
fire
of
active
mentality
but
they
were
always
downcast
and
turned
slightly
askance
so
that
few
people
caught
the
full
force
of
their
gleam
and
there
was
sternness
and
coldness
as
well
as
will
in
the
prominent
chin
and
jaw
he
came
late
but
he
was
a
little
more
cordial
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure
in
coming
than
any
of
those
before
him
his
bows
to
virginia
and
clemm
were
more
profound
his
estimation
of
virginia
beauty
he
made
at
once
apparent
in
the
intense
admiring
gaze
he
bestowed
upon
her
his
words
of
congratulation
and
good
will
for
his
host
were
more
extravagant
than
those
of
any
of
the
others
and
were
uttered
in
a
voice
as
smooth
as
fluent
as
oil
while
he
rubbed
his
large
fleshy
hands
together
in
a
manner
betokening
cordiality
when
his
host
spoke
he
turned
his
ear
toward
him
though
his
eyes
glanced
aside
and
downward
with
an
air
of
marked
attention
and
agreed
emphatically
with
his
views
or
laughed
uproariously
at
his
pleasantries
yet
at
rufus
griswold
heart
jealousy
was
gnawing
heaven
had
endowed
him
with
mind
to
recognize
genius
yet
had
denied
him
its
possession
he
that
would
have
worn
the
laurel
himself
was
born
to
be
but
the
trumpeter
of
others
victories
he
like
edgar
poe
had
an
open
eye
and
ear
for
beauty
for
harmony
he
could
feel
the
divine
fire
of
inspiration
in
the
creations
of
master
minds
yet
he
could
not
himself
create
he
was
a
brilliant
critic
but
as
has
been
said
his
ambition
was
to
be
like
poe
also
a
poet
his
quick
intuition
had
divined
the
genius
of
poe
at
their
first
meeting
he
knew
in
a
flash
that
the
neat
slender
polished
gentleman
with
the
cameo
face
the
large
brow
and
the
luminous
eyes
and
with
the
vibrant
voice
was
one
of
the
few
he
had
ever
met
of
whom
he
could
say
with
assurance
there
goes
a
genius
and
of
those
few
the
topmost
poe
writing
especially
his
poetry
enthralled
him
to
have
been
able
to
come
before
the
world
as
the
author
of
such
work
he
would
have
sold
his
soul
and
this
man
who
had
caught
him
in
a
net
woven
of
mingled
fascination
and
envy
and
hate
had
oh
bitter
while
generously
applauding
him
as
a
critic
and
reviewer
as
a
compiler
and
preserver
of
other
work
had
added
but
but
he
is
no
poet
he
had
received
the
stab
without
an
apparent
flinch
he
had
even
laughed
and
declared
that
poe
was
right
that
he
himself
knew
he
was
no
poet
he
did
not
aspire
to
be
a
real
one
but
only
dropped
into
verse
now
and
then
by
way
of
pastime
the
lie
had
slipped
easily
from
his
tongue
but
his
eyes
drooped
ever
so
little
more
than
usual
as
it
did
so
their
shifty
gleam
glanced
ever
so
little
more
sidewise
and
though
he
came
late
to
the
birthday
feast
his
words
of
friendship
were
emphatic
and
the
laugh
that
told
of
his
pleasure
in
being
there
was
loud
and
frequent
and
he
smiled
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
bided
his
time
and
edgar
poe
was
pleased
immensely
pleased
on
his
gala
night
with
the
complimentary
manner
and
the
complimentary
words
of
this
welcome
guest
of
this
big
brainy
man
whose
good
opinion
he
so
much
desired
alas
hapless
dreamer
did
the
gleam
of
those
eyes
cast
alway
slightly
downward
slightly
askance
give
you
no
discomfort
did
the
teeth
when
the
thick
lips
opened
to
pour
forth
birthday
wishes
or
streams
of
uproarious
laughter
and
the
square
lines
of
the
jaw
suggest
to
your
ready
imagination
no
hint
of
cruelty
if
you
could
but
have
known
that
what
time
he
laughed
and
talked
with
your
guests
and
feasted
at
your
board
with
its
tasty
viands
and
its
cake
with
lighted
candles
and
bent
his
furtive
glance
upon
the
beauty
of
your
guileless
virginia
if
you
could
but
have
known
that
in
his
black
heart
the
canker
jealousy
was
gnawing
and
that
behind
the
smile
he
wore
as
a
mask
the
brainy
man
was
biding
his
time
it
was
a
goodly
little
company
a
coming
together
of
bright
wits
and
for
the
most
part
of
kind
hearts
and
the
talk
was
crisp
and
fresh
and
charming
supper
was
served
early
my
wife
and
her
mother
have
thought
that
you
penn
folk
might
like
to
sit
down
to
a
virginia
supper
said
the
host
as
he
led
graham
to
the
table
and
stood
for
a
moment
while
virginia
designated
the
seats
to
be
taken
then
still
standing
said
every
man
a
priest
to
his
own
household
is
our
virginia
rule
but
as
we
have
with
us
tonight
one
who
before
he
took
up
letters
wore
the

all
heads
were
bowed
while
the
little
ceremonial
was
performed
then
seats
were
taken
and
the
repast
begun
virginia
presided
over
the
while
clemm
occupied
the
seat
nearest
the
door
opening
on
the
kitchen
that
she
might
slip
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
out
and
back
again
when
necessary
but
most
of
the
serving
was
done
by
the
guests
themselves
each
of
whom
helped
the
dish
nearest
his
or
her
plate
and
passed
the
plates
from
hand
to
hand
all
of
the
supper
save
the
dessert
and
fresh
supplies
of
hot
waffles
was
on
the
table
there
were
oysters
and
turkey
salad
and
virginia
ham
and
there
were
hot
rolls
and
made
of
virginia
meal
with
plenty
of
butter
eggs
and
milk
and
a
spoonful
of
boiled
rice
stirred
in
and
there
was
a
sally
lunn
light
brown
and
also
hot
and
plenty
of
waffles
in
the
little
spaces
between
the
more
important
dishes
there
were
pickles
and
preserves
stuffed
mangoes
and
preserved
quinces
and
currant
jelly
and
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
the
beautiful
birthday
cake
frosted
by
virginia
dainty
fingers
and
brilliant
with
its
lighted
candles
there
was
just
enough
room
left
for
the
three
slender
decanters
that
were

edgar
poe
said
tapping
the
stopper
of
a
decanter
of
cider
near
his
plate
all
understood
he
had
served
the
cider
that
he
might
join
with
them
in
their
pledges
of
friendship
and
good
will
without
breaking
through
the
rule
of
abstemiousness
in
which
he
was
finding
so
much
benefit
the
toasts
were
clever
as
well
as
complimentary
and
the
light
and
sparkling
finally
both
clemm
and
virginia
arose
to
clear
the
table
for
the
dessert
you
see
my
friends
we
keep
no
maid
or
butler
said
the
host
but
i
sure
you
will
all
agree
with
me
in
feeling
that
we
would
not
exchange
our
two
hebes
for
any
and
they
take
serving
you
as
a
privilege
the
cake
was
cut
and
served
with
jelly
quivering
and
ruby
red
and
velvety
after
supper
virginia
harp
was
brought
out
of
its
corner
and
she
sang
to
them
with
adorable
sweetness
and
simplicity
she
gave
each
favorite
song
as
it
was
asked
for
filling
all
the
cottage
with
her
pure
sweet
tones
accompanied
by
the
rippling
notes
of
the
harp
the
company
sat
entranced
all
eyes
upon
the
lovely
girl
from
whose
throat
poured
the
streams
of
melody
she
seemed
but
a
child
for
all
she
had
been
married
six
years
she
had
but
just
passed
out
of
her
teens
and
might
easily
have
been
taken
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
her
hair
it
is
true
was
tucked
up
but
the
innocence
in
the
upturned
velvet
eyes
the
soft
childish
outlines
of
the
face
the
dimpled
hands
and
arms
against
the
harp
glided
strings
the
simple
little
frock
of
white
dimity
all
combined
to
give
her
a
babyfied
look
which
was
most
appealing
and
which
her
title
of
poe
seemed
rather
to
accentuate
than
otherwise
rufus
griswold
furtive
eye
rested
balefully
upon
her
and
this
exquisite
being
too
belonged
to
that
man
as
if
the
gods
had
not
already
given
him
enough
from
a
far
corner
of
the
room
her
husband
gazed
upon
her
and
bathed
his
senses
in
contemplation
of
her
beauty
while
his
soul
soared
with
her
song
mother
clemm
noiselessly
passing
near
him
to
snuff
a
candle
on
the
table
upon
which
his
elbow
propping
his
head
rested
paused
for
a
moment
and
laid
a
caressing
hand
upon
his
hair
he
impulsively
drew
her
down
to
a
seat
beside
him
oh
muddie
muddie
look
at
her
look
at
her
he
whispered
there
is
no
one
anywhere
so
beautiful
as
my
little
wife
and
no
voice
like
hers
outside
of
heaven
ah
what
was
the
matter
was
his
virginia
ill
even
as
he
spoke
her
voice
broke
upon
the
middle
of
a
note
then
stopped
one
hand
clutched
the
harp
the
other
flew
to
her
throat
from
which
came
only
an
inarticulate
sound
like
a
struggle
for
utterance
terror
was
in
the
innocent
eyes
and
the
deathly
white
baby
face
for
a
tense
moment
the
little
company
of
birthday
guests
sat
rooted
to
their
places
with
horror
then
rushed
in
a
mass
toward
the
singer
but
her
husband
was
there
first
his
face
like
marble
his
arms
were
around
her
but
with
a
repetition
of
that
inarticulate
gurgling
sound
she
fell
limp
against
his
breast
in
a
swoon
from
the
sweet
lips
where
so
lately
only
melody
had
been
a
tiny
stream
of
blood
oozed
and
trickled
down
and
stained
her
pretty
white
dress
back
all
of
you
commanded
the
low
clear
voice
of
edgar
poe
as
with
the
dear
burden
still
in
his
arms
he
sank
gently
to
the
floor
and
propping
her
head
in
his
lap
disposed
her
limbs
in
comfortable
and
her
dress
in
orderly
manner
back
do
crowd
a
doctor
one
of
the
guests
from
nearby
who
knew
the
neighborhood
had
already
slipped
from
the
door
and
gone
to
fetch
the
nearest
doctor
the
others
sat
and
listened
for
his
step
in
breathless
stillness
edgar
poe
bent
his
marble
face
above
the
prostrate
form
of
his
wife
calling
to
her
in
endearing
whispers
while
with
his
handkerchief
he
wiped
from
her
lips
the
oozing
crimson
stream
his
teeth
chattered
once
before
he
had
seen
such
a
stream
it
was
long
ago
long
ago
but
he
remembered
it
well
he
was
back
a
little
boy
a
mere
baby
in
the
small
dark
room
behind
fipps
millinery
shop
in
richmond
and
a
stream
like
this
came
from
the
lips
of
his
mother
who
lay
so
still
so
white
upon
the
bed
and
his
mother
had
been
dying
he
had
seen
her
thus
he
would
see
her
nevermore
would
the
doctor
never
come
many
days
the
angel
of
death
spread
his
wings
over
the
cottage
in
the
valley
of
the
grass
their
shadow
cast
a
great
stillness
upon
the
cottage
outside
was
a
white
silent
world
snow
had
fallen
snow
on
snow
until
it
lay
deep
deep
upon
the
and
deep
in
the
streets
outside
there
was
no
wind
and
the
trees
that
were
as
sentinels
round
about
the
cottage
stood
still
they
seemed
to
listen
and
to
wait
inside
in
the
upstairs
under
the
shelving
walls
of
the
low
dutch
roof
the
dreamer
heartsease
blossom
lay
broken
and
wan
upon
the
white
bed
it
was
a
very
white
little
blossom
and
the
dark
eyes
seemed
darker
larger
than
ever
before
as
they
looked
out
from
the
pale
face
but
they
had
never
seemed
so
soft
and
a
smile
like
an
angel
played
now
and
again
about
her
lips
beside
her
with
his
lips
pressed
upon
the
tiny
white
hand
which
he
held
in
both
his
own
was
the
bowed
figure
of
a
man
of
a
poet
and
a
lover
who
like
the
trees
seemed
to
listen
and
to
wait
of
a
man
whose
countenance
from
being
pale
was
become
ghastly
whose
eyes
from
being
luminous
were
wild
with
a
divine
despair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
sat
a
woman
with
saintlike
face
uplifted
in
resignation
and
aspiration
for
once
the
busy
hands
were
idle
and
were
clasped
in
her
lap
she
too
listened
and
waited
as
she
had
listened
and
waited
for
days
oh
love
oh
life
are
these
the
happy
trio
who
lived
for
each
other
only
in
the
valley
of
the
grass
the
silence
was
only
broken
when
the
lips
of
the
invalid
moved
to
murmur
some
loving
words
or
to
babble
of
the
flowers
in
the
valley
she
was
in
no
pain
but
she
was
very
tired
she
was
not
unhappy
for
the
two
whom
she
loved
and
who
loved
her
were
with
her
and
though
she
was
tired
she
soon
would
rest
in
heaven
when
she
spoke
of
going
the
man
heart
stood
still
with
terror
he
held
the
hand
closer
and
pressed
his
lips
more
fiercely
upon
it
he
would
not
let
her
go
he
vowed
there
was
no
power
in
heaven
or
hell
to
whom
he
would
yield
her
but
she
sweetly
plead
that
he
would
not
try
to
detain
her
that
he
would
learn
to
bear
the
idea
of
her
leaving
him
which
now
gave
her
no
unhappiness
but
for
one
thought
the
thought
that
after
a
season
he
might
in
the
love
of
some
other
maiden
forget
the
sweet
life
he
had
lived
with
her
in
the
valley
and
that
because
of
his
forgetting
it
would
not
be
given
to
him
to
join
her
at
last
in
the
land
where
she
would
be
waiting
for
him
the
land
of
rest
at
her
words
he
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
beside
her
bed
and
offered
up
a
vow
to
herself
and
to
heaven
that
he
would
never
bind
himself
in
marriage
to
any
other
daughter
of
earth
or
in
any
way
prove
himself
forgetful
of
her
memory
and
her
love
and
to
make
the
vow
the
stronger
he
invoked
a
curse
upon
his
head
if
he
should
ever
prove
false
to
his
promise
and
as
she
listened
her
soft
eyes
grew
brighter
and
she
in
turn
made
a
vow
to
him
that
even
after
her
departure
she
would
watch
over
him
in
spirit
and
if
it
were
permitted
her
would
return
to
him
visibly
in
the
watches
of
the
night
but
if
that
were
beyond
her
power
would
at
least
give
him
frequent
indications
of
her
presence
sighing
upon
him
in
the
evening
winds
or
filling
the
air
which
he
breathed
with
perfume
from
the
censers
of
the
angels
and
she
sighed
as
if
a
deadly
burden
had
been
lifted
from
her
breast
and
trembled
and
wept
and
vowed
that
her
bed
of
death
had
been
made
easy
by
his
vow
but
it
was
not
to
be
the
bed
of
death
little
by
little
the
shadow
lifted
from
over
the
cottage
the
shadow
of
the
wings
of
the
angel
of
death
and
sunshine
fell
where
the
shadow
had
been
and
a
soft
zephyr
made
music
that
was
like
the
music
of
the
voice
of
ligeia
in
the
trees
which
dropped
their
sheath
of
ice
and
the
snow
disappeared
from
the
streets
and
from
the
which
was
all
green
underneath
and
by
the
time
the
crocuses
were
up
health
and
happiness
reigned
once
more
in
the
cottage
but
it
was
a
happiness
with
a
difference
a
happiness
which
for
all
it
was
so
sweet
was
tinctured
with
the
bitter
of
remorse
during
the
illness
of
his
beloved
wife
edgar
poe
had
lived
over
and
over
again
through
the
horror
of
her
death
and
burial
with
all
of
the
details
with
which
the
circumstances
of
his
life
had
so
early
made
him
familiar
and
had
tasted
the
desolation
for
him
which
must
follow
while
his
soul
had
been
overwhelmed
with
this
supreme
sorrow
his
mind
had
been
unusually
clear
and
alert
he
had
been
alive
to
the
slightest
change
in
her
condition
anticipating
her
every
whim
he
had
nursed
her
with
the
tenderness
the
untiring
devotion
of
a
mother
with
her
babe
through
all
his
grief
he
was
quiet
efficient
but
with
the
first
glimmer
of
hope
his
head
reeled
his
reason
which
had
stood
the
shock
of
despair
or
seemed
to
stand
it
gave
way
before
the
return
of
happiness
a
wild
delirium
possessed
him
joy
drove
him
mad
and
already
drunk
with
joy
mad
with
it
he
flung
prudence
philosophy
resolutions
to
the
wind
and
drank
wine
and
drank
and
drank
when
where
how
much
he
did
not
know
but
at
last
merciful
illness
overtook
him
and
stopped
him
in
his
wild
career
with
his
convalescence
his
right
mind
returned
to
him
but
he
felt
as
he
did
when
he
awoke
to
consciousness
in
mother
clemm
in
baltimore
that
he
had
been
down
into
the
grave
and
back
again
only
then
there
was
no
remorse
no
fiercely
accusing
conscience
to
make
him
wish
from
his
soul
that
he
might
have
remained
in
the
abyss
in
and
slippers
he
sat
weak
and
tremulous
in
an
drawn
close
to
the
open
fire
in
the
cottage
about
him
hovered
his
two
angels
anticipating
his
every
need
pausing
at
his
side
now
and
again
to
bestow
a
delicate
caress
virginia
was
more
beautiful
since
her
illness
her
face
and
figure
had
lost
their
plumpness
and
with
it
their
childish
curves
but
a
something
exalted
and
ethereal
had
taken
their
place
her
eyes
were
softer
more
wistful
than
ever
through
her
fair
transparent
skin
glowed
the
faintest
most
exquisite
bloom
her
harp
was
mute
her
singing
voice
was
gone
but
the
deep
low
tones
of
her
speaking
voice
full
of
restrained
feeling
could
only
be
compared
by
her
husband
to
the
melodious
voice
of
the
ligeia
they
recalled
to
him
the
impression
that
the
voice
of
the
priest
as
he
read
the
funeral
rite
over
his
dead
mother
had
made
upon
his
infant
mind
the
impression
of
music
his
virginia
could
no
longer
sing
but
every
word
that
fell
from
her
lips
was
music
as
she
and
her
tall
mother
quietly
stepped
about
the
rooms
ministering
to
his
comfort
lifting
the
work
of
preparing
the
simple
meals
mending
the
fire
and
keeping
the
rooms
bright
into
a
sacred
rite
by
the
grace
the
care
the
dignity
with
which
it
was
performed
no
word
no
look
escaped
either
save
of
tenderness
patience
and
boundless
love
all
the
reproaches
came
from
within
his
own
breast
from
that
inner
self
that
boldly
tearing
the
veil
from
his
deeds
filled
him
with
loathing
of
himself
the
years
his
troubles
and
his
illness
had
wrought
a
great
change
in
him
outwardly
the
dark
ringlets
that
framed
his
face
were
still
untouched
with
rime
and
the
dark
grey
eyes
were
as
vivid
as
in
expression
as
before
but
the
large
brow
wore
a
furrow
and
over
it
and
the
features
and
the
emaciated
cheeks
was
a
settled
pallor
the
face
was
still
very
beautiful
but
in
repose
it
was
melancholy
and
about
the
mouth
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
illumining
smile
still
flashed
out
at
times
and
filled
all
his
countenance
with
sweetness
and
light
but
it
was
rarer
than
formerly
he
had
many
reasons
for
being
happy
for
being
thankful
the
genius
with
which
he
was
conscious
he
was
endowed
in
larger
measure
than
others
of
his
generation
was
being
recognized
he
had
fame
growing
fame
and
money
enough
for
his
needs
he
had
what
was
as
necessary
to
his
soul
as
meat
was
to
his
body
the
love
of
a
woman
who
understood
him
in
all
his
moods
and
who
was
beautiful
enough
in
mind
and
in
body
and
pure
enough
in
spirit
for
him
to
worship
as
well
as
to
love
to
satisfy
his
soul
as
well
as
his
senses
and
this
woman
at
the
very
moment
when
he
thought
himself
about
to
lose
her
forever
had
been
given
back
to
him
given
back
clothed
upon
with
a
finer
a
more
exquisite
beauty
than
she
had
possessed
before
he
had
indeed
found
the
end
of
the
rainbow
but
what
did
it
amount
to
he
was
dissatisfied
not
with
what
life
was
giving
him
but
with
what
he
was
doing
with
his
life
at
the
moment
when
his
cup
was
fairly
overflowing
with
happiness
and
he
should
have
been
strongest
he
had
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
by
the
imp
of
the
perverse
and
had
spoiled
all
nothing
he
had
ever
been
made
to
taste
he
told
himself
was
so
unbearably
bitter
as
this
dissatisfaction
this
disgust
with
self
yet
when
again
the
tiny
crimson
stream
stained
the
sweet
lips
of
his
virginia
and
again
the
angel
of
death
spread
a
dread
wing
for
a
season
over
the
valley
of
the
grass
all
his
knowledge
of
the
bitterness
the
loathing
of
remorse
was
not
sufficient
to
make
him
strong
for
the
struggle
with
grief
and
despair
again
the
reason
of
edgar
poe
gave
way
before
the
strain
and
again
he
fell
chapter
xxvii
a
day
when
the
porch
was
once
more
and
the
a
riot
of
color
and
the
birds
singing
in
the
trees
round
about
found
graham
seated
at
edgar
poe
desk
in
the
office
of
the
door
behind
him
opened
and
he
raised
his
head
from
his
writing
and
quickly
glanced
over
his
shoulder
the
look
of
inquiry
in
his
blue
eyes
instantly
kindled
into
one
of
welcome
come
in
come
in
griswold
he
exclaimed
i
am
more
than
glad
to
see
you
we
are
overwhelmed
with
work
just
now
and
perhaps
we
induce
you
to
lend
a
hand
the
visitor
came
forward
with
outstretched
hand
stooping
and
bowing
his
huge
bulk
as
he
came
in
a
manner
that
to
a
less
artless
mind
than
graham
might
have
suggested
a
touch
of
the
obsequious
his
furtive
but
watchful
eye
had
already
marked
the
fact
that
it
was
at
desk
not
his
own
that
graham
sat
which
was
as
he
had
anticipated
poe
laid
up
again
he
queried
yes
he
seems
to
be
having
quite
an
obstinate
attack
this
time
the
visitor
sadly
shook
his
head
ah
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
do
you
think
his
condition
serious
asked
graham
with
anxiety
griswold
cast
a
glance
of
the
furtive
eye
over
his
shoulder
and
around
the
room
then
stooped
nearer
graham
did
you
know
he
questioned
in
a
lowered
tone
only
that
the
failure
of
his
wife
health
has
been
a
sad
blow
to
him
and
that
after
each
of
her
attacks
he
has
had
a
is
there
anything
more
griswold
stooped
nearer
still
and
brought
his
voice
to
a
yet
lower
key
whiskey
he
whispered
graham
drew
back
and
the
candid
brows
went
up
ah
ah
he
exclaimed
then
fell
silent
and
serious
did
you
never
suspect
it
asked
his
companion
never
i
used
to
hear
rumors
when
he
was
with
billy
burton
but
i
never
saw
any
indications
that
they
were
true
and
did
believe
them
how
could
i
think
of
the
work
the
man
turns
out
its
quantity
its
quality
he
is
at
once
the
most
brilliant
and
the
most
industrious
man
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
meet
and
withal
the
most
perfect
gentleman
exquisite
in
his
manners
and
habits
and
the
soul
of
honor
did
you
ever
know
a
man
addicted
to
drink
to
be
so
immaculately
neat
as
he
always
is
or
so
refined
in
manners
and
speech
or
so
exact
in
his
dealings
there
is
no
one
to
whom
i
would
more
readily
advance
money
or
with
greater
assurance
that
it
will
be
faithfully
repaid
in
his
best
most
painstaking
work
to
the
last
penny
griswold
face
took
on
a
look
of
deep
concern
the
more
the
pity
the
more
the
pity
said
he
a
good
man
gone
wrong
then
with
a
hesitating
somewhat
diffident
air
you
say
that
you
need
help
which
i
might
perhaps
give
graham
was
the
energetic
business
man
once
more
visit
was
most
opportune
he
said
for
while
he
had
on
hand
a
good
deal
of
copy
for
the
next
number
of
the
magazine
furnished
by
poe
before
his
illness
there
were
one
or
two
important
reviews
that
must
be
written
and
griswold
would
be
the
very
man
to
write
them
if
he
would
as
rufus
griswold
seated
himself
at
edgar
poe
desk
a
look
that
was
almost
diabolic
came
into
his
face
the
temporary
substitution
was
but
a
step
he
told
himself
to
permanent
succession
as
editor
of
the
magazine
which
under
poe
management
had
come
to
dominate
thought
in
america
he
could
speak
to
an
audience
such
as
he
had
not
had
before
could
make
or
mar
literary
reputations
and
he
could
bring
the
public
to
recognize
him
as
a
poet
it
so
chanced
that
upon
that
very
day
the
editor
of
found
himself
sufficiently
recovered
from
his
illness
to
go
out
for
the
first
time
as
he
fared
forth
gaunt
and
tremulous
the
midsummer
beauty
of
effected
him
curiously
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
the
rose
on
the
porch
should
be
so
gay
that
the
sunshine
should
lie
so
golden
upon
the
houses
and
in
the
streets
of
spring
garden
that
birds
should
be
singing
and
the
whole
world
going
happily
on
when
his
heart
held
such
black
despair
as
he
went
on
however
the
fresh
sweet
air
gave
him
a
sense
of
physical
that
buoyed
his
spirits
in
spite
of
the
bitterness
of
his
thoughts
he
was
going
to
work
again
and
he
was
glad
of
it
but
he
made
no
resolutions
for
the
future
in
the
past
when
he
had
fallen
and
had
braced
himself
up
again
he
had
sworn
to
himself
that
he
would
be
strong
thereafter
that
he
would
never
never
yield
to
the
temptation
to
touch
wine
again
but
he
had
not
been
strong
and
now
he
looked
the
deplorable
truth
straight
in
the
face
he
hoped
with
all
his
soul
that
he
would
not
fall
again
he
would
give
everything
he
possessed
to
ensure
himself
from
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
taste
the
wild
exhilaration
the
freedom
the
forgetfulness
to
say
to
the
cup
nevermore
to
ensure
himself
from
having
to
pay
the
price
of
his
yielding
in
the
agony
of
remorse
that
was
a
descent
into
hell
but
he
would
deceive
himself
with
no
lying
pledges
he
hoped
he
longed
to
be
strong
but
he
could
not
swear
that
he
would
be
he
did
not
know
whether
he
would
be
or
not
the
temptation
was
not
upon
him
now
he
loathed
the
very
thought
of
it
now
but
the
temptation
would
most
certainly
return
sooner
or
later
he
hoped
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
that
he
would
resist
it
but
he
feared
nay
in
his
secret
heart
he
believed
that
he
would
yield
and
because
he
believed
it
he
loathed
himself
as
he
drew
near
the
office
he
thought
of
graham
how
kind
he
was
how
trustful
he
wondered
if
graham
knew
the
cause
of
his
illnesses
and
if
not
how
long
it
would
before
he
would
know
it
and
if
the
attacks
were
repeated
how
long
he
would
be
able
to
hold
the
place
that
had
shown
him
the
end
of
the
rainbow
how
bitter
it
would
be
to
some
day
find
added
to
all
the
other
disastrous
results
of
his
weakness
of
will
to
find
another
in
the
editorial
chair
of
just
at
this
point
in
his
soliliquy
he
reached
his
destination
he
mounted
the
steps
leading
to
the
office
of
and
opened
the
door
quietly
for
a
moment
the
two
men
in
the
office
each
deep
in
his
own
work
were
unaware
of
his
presence
and
he
stood
staring
upon
their
backs
as
they
sat
at
their
desks
graham
was
in
his
accustomed
seat
and
in
his
the
dreamer
the
giant
frame
of
the
man
whose
big
brain
he
admired
though
he
was
no
poet
the
frame
of
rufus
griswold
horror
clutched
his
heart
graham
evidently
knew
and
knowing
had
supplied
his
place
without
deeming
him
worth
the
trouble
of
notifying
even
had
supplied
it
moreover
with
the
one
man
who
he
himself
believed
would
fill
it
with
credit
the
readers
would
be
satisfied
he
would
not
be
missed
he
turned
and
stumbled
blindly
down
the
stairs
graham
heard
him
and
hurrying
to
the
door
recognized
and
followed
him
trying
to
explain
and
to
persuade
him
to
return
but
he
was
too
much
excited
to
listen
his
reason
prompted
him
to
listen
but
the
imp
of
the
perverse
laughed
reason
to
scorn
seeing
disaster
ahead
he
rushed
headlong
to
embrace
it
he
understood
he
understood
he
reiterated
there
was
nothing
to
explain
graham
had
secured
griswold
services
graham
had
done
well
no
not
for
any
inducement
would
he
consider
returning
he
was
gone
he
was
in
the
street
a
wanderer
a
beggar
he
told
himself
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
for
an
hour
then
exhausted
in
mind
and
body
he
turned
his
face
wearily
in
the
direction
of
spring
garden
with
its
cottage
sheltering
exquisite
beauty
unalterable
love
unfailing
forgiveness
he
must
go
home
and
tell
muddie
and
sissy
that
he
was
a
ruined
man
oh
if
they
would
only
give
him
his
desert
for
once
if
they
would
only
punish
him
as
he
felt
he
should
be
punished
but
they
would
not
they
could
not
for
they
were
angels
they
were
more
they
were
loving
women
filled
with
that
to
which
his
mind
and
his
soul
bowed
down
and
worshipped
as
reverently
as
they
worshipped
god
in
heaven
woman
love
with
its
tenderness
its
purity
and
its
unwavering
steadfastness
they
would
suffer
that
horrible
fear
the
fear
of
the
wolf
at
the
door
which
they
had
not
known
in
their
beloved
spring
garden
and
since
he
had
been
with
would
again
rob
them
of
peace
they
would
bear
it
with
meek
endurance
but
they
would
not
be
able
to
hide
it
from
him
he
would
see
it
in
the
wistful
eyes
of
virginia
and
in
the
patient
eyes
of
muddie
but
they
would
utter
no
reproach
they
would
soothe
him
with
winning
endearments
and
bid
him
be
of
good
cheer
and
would
make
a
gallant
fight
to
show
him
that
they
were
perfectly
happy
during
the
year
and
a
half
of
edgar
poe
connection
with
he
had
raised
the
number
of
subscribers
from
five
thousand
to
thousand
his
salary
like
that
he
had
received
from
had
been
a
mere
pittance
for
such
service
as
he
gave
but
also
like
what
he
received
from
it
had
been
a
regular
income
a
dependence
with
the
addition
of
the
little
checks
paid
him
for
brilliant
work
in
other
periodicals
it
had
amply
served
as
has
been
said
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
in
order
to
make
as
much
without
a
regular
salary
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
sell
a
great
many
articles
and
that
they
should
be
promptly
paid
for
and
so
he
wrote
and
wrote
and
wrote
while
muddie
took
the
little
rolls
of
manuscript
around
and
around
seeking
a
market
for
them
her
stately
figure
and
saintlike
face
became
familiar
at
the
doors
of
all
the
editors
and
publishers
in
philadelphia
it
was
a
weary
business
but
her
strength
and
courage
seemed
never
to
flag
sometimes
she
succeeded
in
selling
a
story
or
a
poem
promptly
and
receiving
prompt
pay
then
there
was
joy
in
the
cottage
sometimes
after
placing
an
article
payment
was
put
off
time
and
time
again
until
hope
deferred
made
sick
the
hearts
of
all
three
dwellers
in
the
cottage
oftentimes
they
were
miserably
poor
sometimes
they
were
upon
the
verge
of
despair
yet
through
all
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
happiness
that
nothing
could
destroy
they
had
each
other
and
even
at
the
worst
they
still
dreamed
the
dream
of
the
valley
of
the
grass
even
though
the
heartsease
blossom
drooped
and
drooped
virginia
attacks
continued
to
come
at
intervals
and
each
time
the
shadow
hung
more
persistently
and
with
deeper
gloom
over
the
cottage
it
would
be
lifted
at
length
but
not
until
the
husband
and
mother
had
suffered
again
all
the
agonies
of
parting
not
until
what
they
believed
to
be
the
last
goodbyes
had
been
said
and
the
imagination
running
ahead
of
the
actual
had
gone
through
each
separate
detail
of
death
and
burial
the
dreamer
thoughts
dwelt
constantly
upon
these
scenes
and
details
until
finally
the
dirges
of
his
hope
one
melancholy
burden
bore
of
never
nevermore
under
the
influence
of
the
state
of
mind
that
was
thus
induced
a
new
poem
began
to
take
shape
in
his
brain
a
poem
of
the
death
of
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
and
the
despair
and
grief
of
the
lover
left
to
mourn
her
in
loneliness
as
it
wrote
itself
in
his
mind
the
word
that
had
thrilled
and
charmed
and
frightened
him
at
the
bedside
of
his
mother
and
to
whose
time
his
feet
had
so
often
marched
as
to
a
measure
the
mournful
mellifluous
word
nevermore
became
its
refrain
the
composition
of
his
new
poem
became
an
obsession
with
him
his
brain
busied
itself
with
its
perfection
automatically
not
only
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
pen
in
hand
frequently
it
happened
that
at
these
times
the
divine
fire
refused
to
kindle
though
he
blew
and
blew
but
at
other
times
without
effort
on
his
part
the
spark
was
struck
the
flames
flashed
forth
and
ran
through
his
thoughts
like
when
he
was
helping
virginia
to
water
the
flowers
in
the
garden
when
he
walked
the
streets
with
dreaming
eyes
raised
skyward
studying
the
clouds
when
he
sat
with
virginia
and
the
mother
under
the
evening
lamp
or
with
feet
on
the
fender
gazed
into
the
heart
of
the
red
embers
or
when
he
lay
in
his
bed
in
the
quiet
and
dark
wherever
he
was
whatever
he
did
the
phrases
and
the
rhythm
of
the
new
poem
were
filtering
through
his
being
polished
and
made
perfect
indeed
the
poem
in
the
making
cast
a
spell
upon
him
and
he
passed
his
days
and
his
nights
as
though
in
a
trance
virginia
and
mother
clemm
knew
that
he
was
in
the
throes
of
creation
and
they
respected
his
mood
stepping
softly
and
talking
little
but
often
by
a
silent
pressure
of
his
hand
or
a
light
kiss
upon
his
brow
saying
that
they
understood
they
were
happy
for
they
knew
the
state
of
mind
that
enveloped
him
to
be
one
of
profound
happiness
to
him
though
the
brooding
look
that
was
often
in
his
grey
eyes
told
them
that
the
visions
he
was
seeing
had
to
do
with
sorrow
they
waited
patiently
feeling
certain
that
in
due
course
would
be
laid
before
them
a
work
in
prose
or
verse
presenting
in
word
and
phrase
scenes
in
some
strange
fascinating
country
which
it
would
charm
them
to
explore
at
last
it
was
done
he
told
them
while
they
sat
at
the
evening
meal
i
have
something
to
read
to
you
two
critics
after
supper
he
said
a
poem
upon
which
i
have
been
working
i
do
know
whether
it
is
of
any
account
or
not
the
two
gentle
critics
were
all
interest
virginia
was
breathless
with
enthusiasm
and
could
hardly
wait
to
finish
her
supper
i
knew
you
were
doing
something
great
she
exclaimed
i
it
is
great
nothing
you
have
ever
done
has
wrapped
you
up
so
completely
you
been
in
a
beautiful
trance
for
weeks
and
muddie
and
i
have
been
almost
afraid
to
breathe
for
fear
of
waking
you
up
too
soon
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
he
brought
out
one
of
the
familiar
narrow
rolls
of
manuscript
and
smilingly
drew
it
out
for
them
to
see
its
length
giving
virginia
one
end
to
hold
while
he
held
the
other
she
read
aloud
in
pondering
tone
the
two
words
that
appeared
at
the
top
the
raven
then
as
she
let
go
the
end
she
held
the
manuscript
coiled
up
as
if
it
had
been
a
spring
and
the
poet
rolled
it
closely
in
his
hands
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
began
not
to
read
but
slowly
to
recite
his
voice
filled
the
room
with
deep
sonorous
melody
saving
which
there
was
no
sound
when
the
last
words
and
my
soul
from
out
that
shadow
that
lies
floating
on
the
floor
shall
be
lifted
nevermore
had
been
said
there
was
a
moment
of
tense
silence
then
virginia
cast
herself
into
his
arms
in
a
passion
of
tears
oh
eddie
she
sobbed
it
is
beautiful
beautiful
but
so
sad
i
feel
as
i
were
the
lenore
and
you
the
poor
lover
but
when
i
leave
you
you
must
not
break
your
heart
like
that
you
and
muddie
will
have
each
other
and
soon
you
will
come
after
me
and
we
will
all
be
happy
together
again
in
heaven
no
word
passed
the
lips
of
the
mother
her
silvered
head
was
bowed
in
grief
and
prayer
she
too
saw
in
lenore
her
darling
child
and
she
felt
in
anticipation
the
loneliness
and
sorrow
of
her
own
heart
she
spoke
no
word
but
from
her
saintly
eyes
two
large
bright
tears
rolled
down
her
patient
cheeks
upon
the
folded
hands
in
her
lap
and
thus
the
raven
was
heard
for
the
first
time
soon
afterward
it
was
recited
again
edgar
poe
carried
it
himself
to
graham
and
offered
it
for
the
magazine
graham
promised
to
examine
it
and
give
him
an
answer
next
day
that
night
he
read
it
over
several
times
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
about
it
its
weirdness
its
music
its
despair
affected
him
greatly
but
graham
was
a
business
man
and
he
doubted
whether
from
a
business
point
of
view
the
poem
was
of
value
would
people
like
it
would
it
he
would
consult
griswold
about
it
griswold
was
a
man
of
safe
judgment
regarding
such
matters
griswold
was
indeed
a
man
of
literary
judgment
and
of
taste
the
beauty
of
the
poem
startled
him
it
would
bring
to
the
genius
of
edgar
poe
he
said
to
himself
the
poetic
genius
acknowledgment
such
as
it
had
never
had
before
it
was
a
poem
to
be
published
he
had
bided
his
time
and
the
hour
of
his
revenge
was
come
he
would
have
given
his
right
hand
to
have
been
able
to
publish
such
a
poem
over
his
own
signature
but
the
world
must
not
know
that
poe
could
write
such
an
one
the
candid
eyes
of
graham
as
he
awaited
his
opinion
were
upon
his
face
his
own
eyes
wore
their
most
furtive
look
cast
down
and
sidelong
his
tone
was
depressed
and
full
of
pity
as
he
said
poor
poe
it
is
too
bad
that
when
he
must
be
in
need
he
can
not
or
does
not
write
something
saleable
of
course
you
could
not
set
such
stuff
as
this
before
the
readers
of
for
once
graham
was
disposed
to
question
his
opinion
i
do
know
about
that
he
said
the
poem
has
a
certain
power
it
seems
to
me
it
might
repel
it
might
fascinate
i
should
like
to
buy
it
just
to
give
the
poor
fellow
a
little
lift
the
lovely
eyes
of
that
fragile
wife
of
his
haunt
me
it
was
finally
decided
to
let
poe
read
the
poem
to
the
office
force
and
take
the
vote
upon
it
they
were
all
drawn
up
in
a
even
the
small
office
boy
who
sat
with
solemn
eyes
and
mouth
open
and
who
felt
the
importance
of
being
called
upon
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
a
piece
of
poetry
edgar
poe
stood
opposite
them
and
for
the
second
time
recited
his
new
poem
then
withdrew
while
the
vote
was
taken
griswold
was
the
first
to
cast
his
vote
and
at
once
emphatically
pronounced
his
no
the
rest
agreed
with
him
that
the
poem
was
too
queer
but
as
a
solace
for
the
poet
disappointment
some
one
passed
around
a
hat
and
the
next
day
a
hamper
of
delicacies
was
sent
to
poe
with
the
compliments
of
the
staff
at
albeit
the
raven
was
rejected
by
graham
magazine
and
others
enough
of
edgar
poe
work
was
bought
and
published
to
keep
his
name
and
fame
before
the
public
just
enough
poorly
paid
as
it
was
to
keep
the
souls
of
himself
and
his
wife
and
his
more
than
mother
within
their
bodies
and
though
graham
would
none
of
the
raven
he
paid
its
author
dollars
for
a
new
story
the
gold
bug
this
sum
seemed
a
small
fortune
to
the
dreamer
at
the
time
but
he
was
to
do
better
than
that
with
his
story
dollar
of
new
york
offered
a
prize
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
best
short
story
submitted
to
it
poe
had
nothing
by
him
but
some
critical
essays
but
remembering
his
early
success
in
baltimore
with
the
found
in
a
bottle
he
was
anxious
to
try
so
he
hastened
with
the
critiques
to
and
offered
them
in
place
of
the
story
graham
agreed
to
the
exchange
and
the
gold
bug
was
promptly
dispatched
to
new
york
where
it
was
awarded
the
prize
when
it
was
published
in
dollar
it
made
a
great
noise
in
the
world
and
a
day
in
the
life
of
edgar
poe
the
hundred
dollars
brought
indeed
a
season
of
comfort
and
cheer
in
the
midst
of
the
hardest
times
the
cottage
in
spring
garden
had
known
but
the
last
penny
was
finally
spent
winter
came
on
the
winter
of
it
was
a
severe
winter
to
the
cottage
the
bow
of
promise
that
had
spanned
it
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
to
such
a
vast
height
above
it
that
its
outlines
were
indistinct
its
colors
well
nigh
faded
out
the
reading
public
still
trumpeted
the
praise
of
edgar
the
dreamer
his
friends
still
believed
in
him
from
many
quarters
their
letters
and
the
letters
of
the
great
ones
of
the
day
fluttered
to
the
cottage
and
not
only
letters
came
but
the
of
the
day
in
person
glad
to
sit
at
edgar
poe
feet
their
hearts
glowing
with
the
eloquence
of
his
speech
and
aching
as
they
recognized
in
the
lovely
eyes
of
the
the
light
that
beckons
to
the
tomb
but
there
were
other
visitors
that
winter
and
less
welcome
ones
though
the
master
of
the
cottage
wrote
and
wrote
filling
the
new
york
and
philadelphia
papers
and
magazines
with
a
stream
of
translations
sketches
stories
and
critiques
for
which
he
was
sometimes
paid
and
sometimes
not
the
aggregate
sum
he
received
was
pitifully
small
and
the
wolf
scratched
at
the
door
and
the
gaunt
features
of
cold
and
want
became
familiar
to
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
of
the
grass
in
desperation
the
driven
poet
turned
this
way
and
that
in
a
wild
effort
to
provide
the
necessities
of
life
for
himself
and
those
who
were
dearer
to
him
than
self
occasionally
appearing
upon
the
lecture
platform
and
finally
attempting
but
without
success
to
secure
government
office
in
washington
and
oftener
and
oftener
and
for
longer
each
time
the
shadow
rested
upon
the
cottage
making
the
valley
dark
and
drear
and
dimming
the
colors
of
the
grass
and
the
flowers
the
dread
shadow
of
the
wing
of
the
angel
of
death
even
at
such
times
the
dreamer
made
a
manful
struggle
to
coin
his
brains
into
gold
to
bring
to
the
cottage
the
comforts
the
conveniences
the
delicacies
that
the
precious
invalid
should
have
had
an
exceedingly
appealing
little
invalid
she
lay
upon
her
bed
in
the
upper
chamber
whose
shelving
ceiling
almost
touched
her
head
and
sometimes
muddie
and
eddie
fanned
her
and
sometimes
they
chafed
her
hands
and
her
feet
and
placed
her
pet
catalina
grown
now
to
a
large
comfortable
cat
in
her
arms
that
the
warmth
of
the
soft
body
and
thick
fur
might
comfort
her
shuddering
frame
and
oftentimes
as
she
lay
there
eddie
sat
at
a
table
nearby
and
wrote
upon
the
long
strips
of
paper
which
he
rolled
into
the
neat
little
rolls
which
he
or
muddie
took
around
to
the
editors
and
sometimes
the
editors
were
glad
to
have
them
and
to
pay
little
checks
for
them
and
sometimes
not
the
truth
was
that
though
the
fame
of
edgar
poe
was
well
established
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
opposition
to
him
that
kept
the
price
of
his
work
down
the
little
authors
venomous
with
spite
and
jealousy
the
little
authors
chief
among
whom
was
rufus
griswold
of
the
furtive
eye
and
deprecating
voice
were
sending
forth
little
whispers
defaming
his
character
exaggerating
his
weakness
and
damning
his
work
with
faint
praise
or
emphatic
abuse
a
day
came
when
edgar
poe
realized
that
he
must
move
on
that
the
city
of
brotherly
love
had
had
enough
of
him
that
to
remain
must
mean
starvation
what
removal
would
mean
he
did
not
know
that
might
mean
starvation
too
but
as
least
he
did
not
know
it
it
was
hard
to
leave
the
cottage
it
was
april
and
about
spring
garden
and
the
cottage
the
old
old
miracle
of
the
renewal
of
life
was
begun
the
birds
were
nesting
and
the
earliest
flowers
were
in
bloom
it
was
bitter
to
leave
it
but
there
was
no
money
for
the
rent
his
fame
had
been
greatest
in
new
york
of
late
the
new
york
papers
had
been
the
most
hospitable
to
his
work
it
was
bitter
to
leave
spring
garden
but
perhaps
somewhere
about
new
york
they
would
find
another
cottage
virginia
was
unusually
well
for
the
present
and
the
prospect
of
a
change
carried
with
it
a
possibility
of
prosperity
who
could
tell
what
good
fortune
they
might
fall
upon
in
new
york
edgar
goodfellow
had
suddenly
made
his
appearance
for
the
first
time
in
many
moons
was
the
thing
they
all
needed
he
told
himself
in
change
there
was
hope
he
placed
mother
clemm
and
catalina
temporarily
with
some
friends
of
the
city
of
brotherly
love
who
had
invited
them
and
accompanied
by
his
virginia
who
was
looking
less
wan
than
for
long
past
fared
forth
in
the
highest
spirits
to
seek
for
the
second
time
a
home
in
new
york
chapter
xxviii
new
york
once
more
they
went
by
rail
to
amboy
and
the
remaining
forty
miles
by
steamboat
certain
cities
like
certain
persons
are
witches
they
have
power
to
cast
a
spell
new
york
is
one
of
them
edgar
and
virginia
poe
had
known
hard
times
in
new
york
the
bitterness
of
hard
times
in
a
city
large
enough
for
each
man
to
mind
his
own
business
and
leave
his
neighbors
to
mind
theirs
yet
as
the
boat
slowed
down
and
neared
the
wharf
and
past
the
shipping
they
descried
the
houses
and
spires
of
town
looming
ghostlike
through
the
enveloping
mist
of
the
soft
grey
april
day
it
was
with
a
thrill
that
these
two
standing
hand
in
hand
like
children
upon
the
deck
clasped
each
other
fingers
with
closer
pressure
and
whispered
new
york
once
more
it
was
their
first
little
journey
in
the
world
just
together
just
they
two
and
much
as
they
loved
the
dear
mother
their
kind
earthly
providence
as
they
laughingly
called
her
there
was
something
very
sweet
about
it
it
was
almost
like
a
wedding
journey
the
star
of
hope
which
never
deserted
them
for
long
no
matter
what
their
disappointments
and
griefs
might
be
shone
bright
above
their
horizon
their
beautiful
faces
reflected
its
light
by
it
the
lines
of
care
and
bitterness
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
smoothed
out
of
edgar
face
and
under
its
influence
virginia
merry
laugh
rippled
out
upon
the
moist
air
causing
the
eyes
of
her
to
turn
admiringly
her
way
many
times
her
husband
hovered
tenderly
near
her
drawing
her
shawl
with
solicitous
hand
closer
about
her
shoulders
and
standing
upon
the
windward
side
of
her
to
protect
her
from
the
damp
and
keen
breeze
he
noted
with
delight
the
fresh
color
of
her
cheeks
the
life
and
color
in
her
eyes
do
you
know
sweetheart
he
said
you
have
not
coughed
once
since
we
left
philadelphia
the
change
is
doing
you
good
already
both
were
blythe
as
birds
as
the
boat
tied
up
at
the
wharf
a
gentle
shower
set
in
but
it
did
not
effect
their
spirits
he
left
her
on
board
with
some
ladies
whose
acquaintance
she
had
made
during
the
journey
while
he
fared
forth
in
the
rain
in
quest
of
a
as
he
stepped
ashore
he
met
a
man
selling
umbrellas
he
bought
quite
a
substantial
one
for
cents
and
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
in
the
lucky
meeting
and
the
good
bargain
in
greenwich
street
he
found
what
he
sought
a
house
with
boarders
wanted
upon
a
card
in
the
window
another
good
bargain
was
made
and
hailing
a
passing
hack
he
hastened
back
to
the
boat
for
virginia
and
her
trunk
and
soon
they
were
rattling
over
the
cobblestones
why
this
is
quite
a
mansion
exclaimed
the
little
wife
as
she
peered
out
at
the
house
before
which
the
carriage
stopped
for
while
the
gentility
of
the
establishment
was
of
the
proverbial
shabby
variety
the
porch
and
pillars
gave
it
an
air
of
unmistakable
dignity
not
long
after
their
arrival
the
rang
and
they
found
themselves
responding
with
alacrity
when
they
took
the
seats
assigned
them
and
their
hungry
eyes
took
in
the
feast
spread
before
them
they
squeezed
each
other
hands
under
the
table
these
romantic
young
lovers
and
dreamers
they
had
been
happy
in
spite
of
frugality
many
a
time
while
hunger
gnawed
they
had
kissed
each
other
and
vowed
they
wanted
nothing
high
heaven
pardoning
the
gallant
lie
yet
now
the
traveller
appetite
making
their
palates
keen
the
travellers
weariness
in
their
limbs
they
were
seized
upon
by
an
unblushing
joy
at
finding
themselves
seated
at
an
ample
board
with
a
kindly
landlady
at
the
head
pouring
tea
strong
and
hot
whose
aroma
was
as
the
breath
of
roses
in
their
nostrels
while
her
portly
and
beaming
spouse
at
the
foot
with
blustering
hospitality
pressed
the
bounty
of
the
table
upon
them
a
bounteous
table
indeed
this
decidedly
cheap
and
somewhat
shabby
spread
and
to
their
eager
appetites
everything
seemed
delicious
there
were
wheat
bread
and
rye
bread
butter
and
cheese
cold
country
ham
and
cold
spring
veal
generous
slices
of
both
piled
up
like
little
mountains
and
in
like
abundance
they
feasted
daintily
exquisitely
as
they
did
everything
but
they
feasted
heartily
for
the
first
time
in
months
after
supper
they
went
to
their
room
a
spacious
and
comfortably
though
plainly
furnished
one
with
a
bright
fire
burning
in
a
jolly
little
stove
their
spirits
knew
no
bounds
what
would
catalina
say
to
this
solid
comfort
sis
queried
eddie
i
think
she
would
faint
for
joy
for
answer
virginia
smiled
upon
him
through
a
mist
of
tears
why
virginia
my
heart
he
cried
in
amazement
what
is
it
only
that
it
is
too
beautiful
she
managed
to
say
and
to
think
that
muddie
and
catalina
are
not
here
to
share
it
with
us
just
as
soon
as
i
can
scrape
together
enough
money
to
pay
for
board
and
travelling
expenses
we
will
have
them
with
us
he
assured
her
she
dried
her
eyes
and
perched
upon
his
knee
while
he
went
through
his
pockets
and
bringing
out
all
the
money
he
had
counted
it
into
her
palm
four
dollars
and
a
half
he
said
not
much
but
we
are
fortunate
to
have
that
and
with
such
fine
living
as
we
get
here
so
cheap
it
will
go
quite
a
long
way
let
me
see
the
price
of
board
and
lodging
is
only
three
and
a
half
a
week
for
both
of
us
seven
dollars
would
pay
our
way
for
a
fortnight
and
in
a
fortnight
time
there
no
telling
what
may
turn
up
some
editor
might
buy
raven
or
money
due
me
for
work
already
sold
might
come
in
if
i
could
only
contrive
to
raise
this
sum
to
seven
dollars
we
could
rest
easy
for
at
least
a
fortnight
i
tell
you
how
said
virginia
you
have
acquaintances
here
hunt
up
some
of
them
and
borrow
three
dollars
then
you
would
have
enough
to
pay
two
weeks
board
ahead
and
fifty
cents
over
for
pocket
money
wise
little
head
exclaimed
he
tapping
her
brow
the
very
idea
and
forthwith
all
care
as
to
ways
and
means
was
thrown
from
both
their
minds
and
they
gave
themselves
up
to
an
evening
of
enjoyment
of
the
comforts
of
their
mansion
while
virginia
was
resting
her
husband
went
out
for
a
little
shopping
to
be
done
with
part
of
the
fifty
cents
they
had
allowed
themselves
for
spending
money
first
he
exchanged
a
few
cents
for
a
tin
pan
to
be
filled
with
water
and
placed
on
top
of
the
stove
for
the
comfort
of
virginia
who
had
been
oppressed
by
the
dry
heat
then
a
few
cents
more
went
for
two
buttons
his
coat
lacked
a
skein
of
thread
to
sew
them
on
with
and
a
skein

close
contact
with

of
the

next
day
was
a
bright
beautiful
spring
sunday
the
sky
and
budding
trees
had
the
aspect
often
seen
after
a
season
of
rain
the
sound
of
was
on
the
air
the
streets
were
filled
with
people
in
their
best
clothes
and
the
new
boarders
in
greenwich

fortified
with
a
breakfast
of
ham
and
eggs
and

jubilantly
joined

stream
of

flowed
toward
the
point

pierced

clear
sky
on
monday
edgar
poe
was
taken
with
what
he
called
a
writing
fit
for
several
days
during
which
edgar
goodfellow
remained
in
the
ascendency
the
fit
remained
on
him
and
he
wrote
incessantly
only
pausing
long
enough
now
and
then
to
read
the
result
to
virginia
this
will
earn
us
the
money
to
bring
muddie
and
catalina
to
new
york
he
said
with
confidence
at
last
the
manuscript
was
finished
and
no
sooner
was
the
ink
dry
upon
the
paper
than
he
took
it
to
which
promptly
bought
and
paid
for
it
and
upon
the
next
sunday
april
printed
it
not
as
a
story
but
as
news
astounding

by
express

a
passage
of
hours
from

to
land
full
particulars
of
the
voyage
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
astounding
news
was
received
by
the
people
of
new
york
for
fact
there
was
a
rush
for
copies
of
the
which
announced
with
truth
that
it
was
the
only
paper
in
possession
of
the
news
and
not
until
denial
came
from
charleston
several
days
later
was
it
suspected
that
the
news
was
all
a
hoax
and
that
edgar
goodfellow
was
simply
having
a
little
fun
at
the
expense
of
the
public
the
story
did
indeed
earn
money
with
which
to
bring
muddie
and
catalina
to
new
york
it
did
more
it
brought
the
editors
to
greenwich
street
looking
for
manuscript
they
begged
for
stories
as
clever
and
as
sensational
as
the
balloon
hoax
but
in
vain
edgar
goodfellow
had
vanished
and
in
his
place
was
edgar
the
dreamer
who
only
had
to
tell
of
a
wild
weird
clime
that
lieth
sublime
out
of
space
out
of
time
where
the
traveller
meets
aghast
sheeted
memories
of
the
past
shrouded
forms
that
start
and
sigh
as
they
pass
the
wanderer
by
forms
of
friends
long
given
in
agony
to
the
earth
and
heaven
it
was
in
vain
that
the
editors
besought
him
to
try
something
else
in
the
vein
of
the
balloon
hoax
assuring
him
that
that
was
what
his
readers
were
expecting
of
him
after
his
recent
hit
that
was
what
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
him
for
pay
him
well
was
it
the
imp
of
the
perverse
that
caused
him
to
positively
decline
and
to
persist
that
dreamland
was
all
he
had
to
offer
just
then
it
was
graham
who
finally
accepted
this
quaint
and
beautiful
poem
and
who
published
it
in
the
june
number
of
in
october
following
the
return
of
the
poes
to
new
york
october
of
the
year
nathaniel
willis
who
was
then
editor
of
evening
and
had
been
editor
of
dollar
when
it
awarded
the
prize
of
a
hundred
dollars
to
the
gold
bug
was
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
mirror
office
when
in
response
to
his
come
in
a
stranger
appeared
in
his
doorway
a
woman
a
lady
in
the
best
sense
of
a
word
almost
become
obsolete
a
describes
her
best
of
all
she
was
a
gentlewoman
then
past
middle
age
yet
beautiful
with
the
high
type
of
beauty
that
only
ripe
years
beautifully
lived
can
bring
the
beauty
that
compensates
for
the
fading
of
the
rose
on
cheek
and
lip
the
dimming
of
the
light
in
the
eyes
for
the
frost
on
the
brow
the
beauty
of
patience
of
tenderness
of
faith
unquenchable
by
fire
or
flood
of
adversity
a
history
was
written
on
the
face
a
history
in
which
there
was
plainly
much
of
tragedy
yet
not
one
bitter
line
was
there
it
was
a
face
withal
which
could
only
have
belonged
to
a
mother
and
might
well
have
belonged
to
the
mother
niobe
in
figure
she
was
tall
and
stately
with
a
gentle
dignity
her
dress
was
simple
to
plainness
and
might
have
been
called
shabby
had
it
been
less
beautifully
neat
it
was
of
unrelieved
black
and
she
wore
a
conventional
widow
bonnet
with
floating
white
strings
the
reader
needs
no
introduction
to
this
stranger
to
willis
who
in
a
gentle
voice
with
a
certain
mournful
cadence
in
it
announced
herself
as
clemm
the
of
mr
poe
no
connection
with
a
famous
author
was
needed
to
inspire
willis
with
respect
for
his
visitor
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
angel
upon
earth
and
it
was
with
an
air
approaching
reverence
that
he
handed
her
to
the
most
comfortable
chair
the
office
afforded
her
errand
was
quickly
made
known
edgar
poe
was
ill
and
not
able
to
come
out
himself
his
wife
was
an
invalid
and
so
it
devolved
upon
her
to
seek
employment
for
him
in
spite
of
his
fame
she
said
and
of
his
industry
his
manuscripts
brought
him
so
little
money
that
he
was
in
need
of
the
necessities
of
life
regular
work
with
a
regular
income
however
small
she
felt
to
be
his
only
hope
of
being
able
to
rise
above
want
willis
was
distressed
and
promptly
offered
all
he
could
it
was
not
much
but
it
was
better
than
nothing
it
was
the
place
of
assistant
editor
of
his
paper
for
months
following
the
figure
of
edgar
poe
was
a
familiar
one
in
the
office
of
the
neither
in
his
character
of
edgar
the
dreamer
nor
that
of
edgar
goodfellow
was
he
especially
known
there
but
simply
as
a
modest
industrious
doing
the
work
of
a
mechanical
paragraphist
as
quietly
as
unobtrusively
as
a
machine
with
rarely
a
smile
and
rarely
a
word
he
stood
from
morning
till
night
at
his
desk
in
a
corner
of
the
editorial
room
pale
still
and
beautiful
as
a
statue
punctual
and
efficient
and
the
embodiment
of
courtesy
always
and
quietly
and
unobtrusively
his
personality
made
itself
felt
willis
came
to
love
him
for
his
innate
charm
and
for
his
faithfulness
to
duty
but
the
desk
of
a
could
not
long
hold
a
genius
like
edgar
poe
he
bore
its
drudgery
without
complaint
but
when
an
opening
that
seemed
to
invite
his
ambition
as
well
as
to
promise
better
pay
came
he
hailed
it
with
enthusiasm
in
march
of
the
next
year
he
formed
a
partnership
with
two
new
york
journalists
as
editors
and
managers
of
broadway
a
few
months
later
saw
him
sole
proprietor
as
well
as
editor
and
for
a
short
bright
period
his
old
dream
of
a
magazine
of
his
own
in
which
he
could
write
as
he
pleased
came
true
its
realization
seemed
to
inspire
him
with
new
energy
how
many
heads
how
many
right
hands
had
the
man
his
readers
asked
each
other
that
he
could
turn
out
such
a
mass
of
work
of
such
high
order
his
own
and
many
other
of
the
magazines
of
the
day
were
filled
with
reviews
and
criticisms
that
made
him
the
terror
of
other
writers
and
with
stories
and
poems
that
made
him
the
marvel
of
readers
everywhere
his
works
were
translated
into
the
tongues
of
france
germany
and
spain
and
his
fame
grew
in
all
of
those
countries
yet
the
most
that
he
could
afford
in
the
way
of
a
home
was
up
two
flights
of
stairs
two
rooms
in
the
third
story
of
a
dingy
old
house
in
east
broadway
mother
clemm
and
virginia
kept
them
bright
and
spotless
and
catalina
dosing
on
the
hearth
gave
a
final
touch
of
comfort
and
they
were
far
above
the
noise
and
dust
of
the
streets
with
windows
opening
upon
a
goodly
view
of
the
sky
they
had
a
front
and
a
back
room
so
that
the
beauties
of
the
dawn
and
the
noontide
of
sunset
and
moonrise
were
all
theirs
and
the
wolf
came
not
near
the
door
and
the
three
whose
natures
were
like
to
the
natures
of
the
oak
the
vine
and
the
heartsease
and
who
lived
for
each
other
only
dreamed
again
the
dream
of
the
wonderful
valley
the
valley
of
the
grass
chapter
xxix
up
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
sprang
the
dreamer
one
white
january
day
and
burst
in
upon
mother
clemm
who
was
preparing
dinner
and
virginia
who
was
mending
his
coat
he
was
in
a
great
glee
he
caught
muddie
in
his
arms
where
she
stood
with
her
hands
deep
in
a
tray
of
dough
and
kissed
her
then
stooped
over
virginia
and
kissed
and
dropped
into
her
lap
a
crisp
ten
dollar
bank
note
she
gave
a
little
scream
of
delight
where
did
you
get
it
she
cried
from
willis
i
sold
him
raven
he
vastly
taken
with
it
and
not
only
paid
me
the
ten
in
advance
but
will
give
the
poem
an
editorial
puff
in
the
of
the
nineteenth
he
showed
me
a
rough
draft
he
will
say
that
it
is
most
effective
example
of
fugitive
poetry
ever
published
in
this
country
and
predict
that
it
will
in
the
memory
of
everybody
who
reads
it
and
it
will
it
will
cried
virginia
especially
that
i
done
everything
in
time
to
it
since
the
first
night
you
read
it
to
us
i
done
everything
in
time
to
it
since
i
was
three
years
old
murmured
her
husband
he
drew
the
miniature
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
where
he
had
carried
it
close
against
his
heart
throughout
his
life
and
gazed
long
upon
it
in
his
grey
eyes
was
the
tender
brooding
expression
which
the
picture
always
called
forth
ever
since
i
heard
that
word
for
the
first
time
from
the
lips
of
my
old
nurse
when
she
took
me
in
to
see
my
mother
robed
for
the
grave
my
feet
and
my
thoughts
have
kept
time
to
it
and
generally
when
my
steps
and
my
face
have
been
set
toward
hope
and
happiness
it
has
risen
before
me
like
a
wall
blocking
my
way
virginia
arose
from
her
chair
letting
her
work
and
the
bank
note
fall
unheeded
from
her
lap
and
went
to
him
gently
taking
the
miniature
from
his
hands
she
restored
it
to
its
place
in
his
pocket
and
then
with
a
hand
on
each
of
his
shoulders
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
buddie
she
said
calling
him
by
the
old
pet
name
of
their
earliest
days
you
frighten
me
sometimes
the
miniature
is
beautiful
but
it
makes
you
so
sad
and
when
you
talk
that
way
about
raven
i
feel
as
if
i
could
hear
your
tears
dropping
on
my
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
mood
her
laugh
rang
out
and
she
pressed
her
lips
upon
his
i
have
you
know
she
said
i
not
dead
yet
and
you
will
not
have
to
journey
to
any
aidenn
to
me
no
thank
god
he
breathed
crushing
her
to
him
it
was
upon
january
that
the
raven
appeared
with
introductory
puff
in
spite
of
griswold
and
the
staff
of
it
created
an
instant
furor
it
was
published
and
republished
upon
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
to
quote
a
contemporary
writer
everybody
was
about
it
except
a
few
waspish
foes
who
would
do
its
author
more
good
than
harm
it
brought
to
the
two
bright
rooms
up
the
two
flights
of
stairs
visitors
by
the
score
eager
to
congratulate
the
poet
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
interesting
wife
and
mother
and
to
assure
all
three
of
their
welcome
to
homes
approached
by
steps
and
it
brought
letters
by
the
score
some
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
among
these
was
one
from
miss
elizabeth
barrett
soon
to
become
the
wife
of
robert
browning
your
has
produced
a
sensation
here
in
england
she
wrote
some
of
my
friends
are
taken
by
the
fear
of
it
and
some
by
its
music
i
hear
of
persons
haunted
by
the
and
one
of
my
friends
who
has
the
misfortune
of
possessing
a
bust
of
pallas
never
can
bear
to
look
at
it
in
the
twilight
browning
is
much
struck
by
the
rhythm
of
the
poem
then
there
is
that
tale
of
yours
case
of
valdemar
throwing
us
all
into
a
admired
disorder
and
dreadful
doubts
as
to
whether
can
be
true
as
children
say
of
ghost
stories
the
certain
thing
in
the
tale
in
question
is
the
power
of
the
writer
and
the
faculty
he
has
of
making
horrible
improbabilities
seem
near
and
familiar
of
all
the
letters
from
far
and
near
this
was
the
one
that
gave
the
dreamer
most
pleasure
and
as
for
virginia
and
the
mother
they
read
it
until
they
knew
it
by
heart
when
some
months
later
his
new
book
the
raven
and
other
poems
came
out
its
dedication
was
to
the
noblest
of
her
sex
miss
elizabeth
barrett
of
england
and
there
was
joy
in
the
two
rooms
up
two
flights
of
stairs
where
edgar
poe
sat
at
his
desk
reeling
off
his
narrow
little
strips
of
manuscript
by
the
yard
his
work
filled
broadway
and
overflowed
into
many
other
periodicals
while
he
created
stories
and
poems
he
gave
more
attention
than
ever
to
the
duties
of
his
cherished
post
as
defender
of
purity
of
style
for
american
letters
and
the
fame
to
which
he
had
risen
giving
him
new
authority
he
made
or
marred
the
reputation
of
many
a
literary
aspirant
exposition
of
plagiarism
became
a
hobby
with
him
and
his
attacks
upon
longfellow
upon
this
ground
brought
on
a
controversy
between
him
and
the
gentle
poet
which
reached
such
a
heat
that
it
was
dubbed
the
longfellow
war
all
attempts
of
friends
and
fellow
journalists
to
make
him
more
moderate
in
his
criticisms
were
in
vain
they
seemed
indeed
but
to
excite
the
imp
of
the
perverse
under
whose
influence
he
became
more
merciless
than
ever
an
admirer
of
this
virtue
carried
to
such
an
extreme
that
it
became
a
serious
fault
as
it
was
assuredly
a
grievous
mistake
humorously
characterized
him
in
a
parody
upon
the
raven
containing
the
following
stanza
neither
rank
nor
station
heeding
with
his
foes
around
him
bleeding
sternly
singly
and
alone
his
course
he
kept
upon
that
floor
while
the
countless
foes
attacking
neither
strength
nor
valor
lacking
on
his
goodly
armor
hacking
wrought
no
change
his
visage
as
with
high
and
honest
aim
he
still
his
falchion
proudly
bore
resisting
error
evermore
many
of
the
waspish
foes
thus
made
turned
their
stings
upon
his
private
character
against
which
there
was
already
a
secret
poison
working
the
poison
that
fell
from
the
tongue
and
the
pen
of
rufus
griswold
he
had
the
ear
of
numbers
of
edgar
poe
friends
in
the
literary
world
and
what
time
the
dreamer
dreamed
his
dreams
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
unfriendliness
toward
him
of
the
big
man
whose
big
brain
he
admired
the
big
man
watched
for
his
chance
to
insert
the
poison
it
was
invariably
hidden
in
a
coating
of
sugar
poe
was
a
wonderful
genius
he
would
declare
his
imagination
his
style
they
were
marvellous
marvelous
his
was
all
right
but
the
but
always
came
in
a
lowered
tone
full
of
commiseration
his
allowance
should
of
course
be
made
for
his
innate
lack
of
principle
he
should
not
be
held
responsible
his
habits
well
known
to
everyone
of
course
no
they
were
not
even
suspected
many
of
his
listeners
replied
might
not
griswold
be
mistaken
they
asked
was
it
possible
that
an
habitual
drunkard
could
turn
out
such
a
mass
of
brilliant
and
artistic
work
and
consider
the
exquisite
neatness
of
his
manuscript
peradventure
the
listener
persisted
in
believing
his

the

therefore
escaped

to

an
event
in

seem
to

there
is
something
uncanny
about
him

up
of
the

and
women
best
worth

she
became
one
of
the

most
intimate

and
always
made
him
and
his

welcome
at
her
evenings
it
was
not
long
after
the
raven
had
set
the
town
marching
to
the
word
nevermore
that
he
made
his
first
visit
there
a
visit
which
long
stood
out
clear
in
the
memories
of
all

in
the
cavernous

huge
grate
full
of
glowing

a
ruddy
warmth
into

waxen
tapers
in

and
in

and
in

filled
the
apartment
with
a
blaze
of
soft
light

up
the
sparkling
eyes
and
bright
intellectual
faces
of

showed
to

miss

stood
at
one
end
of
the
room
between
the
richly
curtained
windows
and
immediately
in
front
of
a
narrow
mirror
which
reached
from
the
frescoed
ceiling
to
the
floor
and
reflected
her
gracious
figure
to
advantage
she
was
listening
with
interested
attention
to

for

at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
a
lovely
woman
in
a
chippendale
chair
was
the
central
figure
of
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
each
of
whom
hung
upon
her
least
word
with
an
interest
amounting
to
affection
she
was
a
woman
who
looked
like
a
girl

thirty
years

been

brown
hair

griswold

whose
furtive
glance
had
she
been
less
free
from

might
have
read
an
admiration
fiercer
than
that
of

with
a
kindly
word
for
everybody
the
falling
softly
upon
his
flowing
silver
locks
and
his
beaming
ruddy
countenance
suddenly
there
was
a
slight
stir
in
the
room
a
cessation
of
talk
a
turning
toward
one
point
there
is
now
said
gillespie
to
miss
lynch
and
followed
her
as
with
hand
and
cordial
smile
she
hastened
toward
the
door
where
stood
the
trim
erect
figure
of
edgar
poe
with
his
prominent
brow
and
his
big
dreamy
eyes
and
his
wife
pale
as
a
after
her
many
illnesses
and
as
lovely
as
one
and
still
looking
like
a
child
upon
his
arm
instant
pleasure
and
welcome
were
written
upon
every
face
present
save
one
and
even
that
quickly
assumed
a
smile
as
its
owner
came
forward
bowing
and
stooping
in
an
excess
of
courtesy
the
pair
became
immediately
the
centre
of
attraction
everybody
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
them
it
made
virginia
thoroughly
happy
to
see
eddie
appreciated
and
she
chatted
blythely
and
freshly
with
all
her
spontaneous
laugh
bearing
testimony
to
her
enjoyment
while
the
dreamer
yielded
himself
with
his
wonted
modesty
and
grace
to
the
hour
answering
questions
as
to
whether
he
believe
in
ghosts
and
whether
the
experiments
in
mesmerism
in
his
story
the
case
of
valdemar
had
foundation
in
fact
with
his
captivating
but
enigmatic
smile
and
a
little
frenchified
shrug
of
the
shoulders
it
would
have
seemed
at
first
that
he
had
diverted
attention
from
the
fair
author
of
the
poetry
of
flowers
to
himself
but
erelong
no
one
knew
just
how
it
came
to
pass
edgar
poe
was
sitting
upon
an
ottoman
drawn
close
to
the
chippendale
chair
and
the
two
lions
were
deep
in
earnest
and
intimate
conversation
upon
which
no
one
else
dared
intrude
the
furtive
eye
of
rufus
griswold
marked
well
the
evident
attraction
between
these
two
beautiful
and
gifted
beings
and
something
like
murder
awoke
in
his
heart
the
was
interrupted
by
miss
lynch
who
declared
that
she
voiced
the
wish
of
all
present
in
requesting
that
poe
would
recite
the
raven
all
the
candles
save
enough
to
make
with
the
fire
glow
a
dim
twilight
were
put
out
and
the
poet
took
his
stand
at
one
end
of
the
long
room
a
hush
fell
upon
the
company
and
in
a
quiet
clear
musical
voice
he
began
the
familiar
words
there
was
scarcely
a
gesture
just
the
motionless
figure
the
pale
classic
face
which
was
dim
in
the
and
the
deep
rich
voice
miss
lynch
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
following
the
final
nevermore
moving
toward
him
with
her
easy
distinguished
step
she
thanked
him
in
a
few
words
osgood
rising
gracefully
from
her
chair
followed
her
example
with
griswold
at
her
heels
and
in
a
few
moments
more
the
whole
room
was
in
an
awed
and
subdued
hum
the
came
in
for
her
share
of
the
lionizing
her
appearance
was
in
marked
contrast
to
that
of
the
richly
apparelled
women
about
her
the
simplest
dress
was
the
only
kind
within
her
reach
for
which
she
may
have
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
the
kind
that
most
adorned
her
she
wore
tonight
a
little
frock
made
by
her
own
fingers
of
some
crimson
woolen
stuff
without
a
vestige
of
ornament
save
a
bit
of
lace
yellow
with
age
at
the
throat
her
hair
was
parted
above
the
placid
brow
looped
over
her
ears
and
twisted
in
a
loose
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
in
the
prevailing
fashion
for
a
young
matron
which
with
her
youthful
face
gave
her
a
most
quaint
and
charming
appearance
her
husband
coat
had
seen
long
service
but
it
was
neatly
brushed
and
darned
and
the
ability
to
wear
threadbare
clothing
with
distinction
was
not
the
least
of
edgar
poe
talents
beside
his
worn
but
apparel
costly
dress
often
seemed
tawdry
out
from
the
warmth
and
the
light
and
the
perfume
and
the
luxury
and
the
praise
of
the
beautiful
with
its
distinguished
assemblage
out
into
the
streets
of
new
york
into
the
bleakness
and
the
darkness
of
the
winter
night
stepped
edgar
poe
and
his
wife
virginia
was
wrapped
against
the
cold
in
a
paisley
shawl
that
had
been
one
of
mother

presents
while
edgar
wore
the
military
cape
he
had
at

and
which
except

of
unusual
prosperity
had
served
him
as
a
ever
since
through
the
streets
slippery
with
ice
and
they
made
their
way
to
the
two
rooms
up
two
flights
of
stairs
where
the
widow
clemm
mended
the
fire
with
a
few
coals
at
a
time
and
sewed
by
a
single
candle
as
she
waited
for
them
the

of

most
distinguished
circle
in

and
his
beautiful

back
from
a
world
of
dreams
created
by
a
company
of
dreamers
to
the
reality
of
an
empty
larder
and
a
low
fuel

a
dun

the
landlord

whom
they
rented
the
two

brought
its

were
clamoring
for

supplying

as
fast
as
one

could
and
some
of
them
were
sending
their
little
checks
promptly
in
return
and
some
were
promising
little
checks
some
day
but
broadway
had
failed
for
lack
of
capital
it
was
the
old
story
he
had
no
regular
income
and
the
irregularly
appearing
little
checks
only
provided
a
sort
of
living
for
the
three
yet
they
had
their

of

anxiety
for

health
and

the

and
comforts

enough
to
arouse

devils
and
they
did
why
detail
the
harassments
of
the
rest
of
that
winter
during
which
the
dreamer
led
a
strange
double
life
a
life
in
the
public
eye
of
distinction
prosperity
popularity
but
in
private
a
hunted
life
a
life
of
constant
dread
of
the
wrath
of
a
too
long
indulgent
landlord
or
grocer
a
flitting
from
one
cheap
lodgement
to
another
one
gleam
of
genuine
sunshine
brightened
the
dreary
days
the
acquaintance
with
frances
osgood
begun
at
miss
lynch
salon
soon
ripened
into
close
friendship
she
found
her
way
up
the
two
flights
of
stairs
and
edgar
and
virginia
and
the
mother
received
her
with
as
ready
courtesy
and
welcome
as
though
the
two
rooms
that
looked
on
the
sky
had
been
a
palace
her
intimacy
became
so
complete
her
understanding
of
and
sympathy
with
the
three
who
lived
for
each
other
only
so
perfect
that
it
was
almost
as
if
she
had
been
admitted
to
the
valley
of
the
grass
upon
her
the
dreamer
bestowed
in
abundant
measure
that
poetic
love
which
the
normal
heart
is
no
more
capable
of
feeling
than
the
normal
mind
is
capable
of
producing
his
poetry
a
love
which
was
like
his
landscapes
not
of
this
world
or
of
the
earth
earthy
a
love
of
the
mind
the
imagination
the
poetic
faculty
a
love
whose
desire
was
not
to
possess
but
to
kneel
to
in
his
rhapsodies
over
the
phantasmal
women
his
genius
created
or
the
real
ones
whose
charm
he
felt
it
was
never
of
flesh
and
blood
beauty
of
blooming
cheek
or
rounded
form
that
he
sang
but
of
the
expression
of
the
eye
the
tones
of
the
voice
the
graces
and
gifts
of
the
spirit
and
the
intellect
in
return
for
this
love
he
asked
only
sympathy
sympathy
such
as
he
drew
from
the
sky
and
the
forest
and
the
lake
and
the
winds
of
heaven
mood
sympathy
it
was
a
love
quite
beyond
the
imagination
of
rufus
griswold
to
conceive
of
even
his
furtive
eye
was
on
the
watch
his
jealous
heart
was
filled
with
foul
surmises
and
he
added
a
new
poison
to
the
old
with
which
he
was
working
drop
by
drop
upon
the
good
name
of
edgar
poe
meantime
the
poet
harassed
by
troubles
of
divers
kinds
but
innocent
of
the
new
poison
as
he
had
been
of
the
old
welcomed
the
intimacy
of
this
congenial
woman
friend
as
balm
to
his
tried
spirit
and
delved
away
at
his
work
upon
his
desk
one
morning
were
piled
a
number
of
the
small
rolls
of
narrow
manuscript
with
which
the
reader
is
familiar
these
were
a
series
of
critical
sketches
entitled
the
literati
of
new
york
by
which
he
hoped
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
some
days
virginia
was
listening
for
a
step
on
the
stair
for
she
had
written
osgood
a
note
that
morning
begging
her
to
come
to
them
and
she
knew
that
she
would
respond
the
door
opened
and
the
slight
graceful
figure
and
delicate
face
with
the
gentle
eyes
she
looked
for
appeared
what
are
all
these
asked
the
visitor
when
she
had
embraced
virginia
warmly
and
when
the
poet
had
after
bowing
over
her
hand
which
he
lightly
touched
with
his
lips
led
her
to
a
chair
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
pile
of
manuscripts
one
of
them
is
yourself
madam
replied
the
poet
myself
she
questioned
in
amazement
he
bowed
gravely
yourself
as
one
of
the
literati
of
new
york
in
each
one
of
these
one
of
you
is
rolled
up
and
discussed
i
will
show
you
by
the
difference
in
their
length
the
varying
degrees
of
estimation
in
which
i
hold
you
literary
folk
come
virginia
and
help
me
the
fair
visitor
smiled
as
they
drew
out
to
the
full
length
roll
after
roll
of
the
manuscript
letting
them
fly
together
again
as
if
they
had
been
spiral
springs
the
largest
they
saved
for
the
last
the
poet
lifted
it
from
its
place
and
gave
an
end
to
his
wife
and
like
two
merry
laughing
children
they
ran
to
opposite
corners
stretching
the
manuscript
diagonally
across
the
entire
space
between
and
whose
sweetness
long
drawn
out
is
that
asked
the
visitor
hear
her
cried
edgar
goodfellow
who
was
in
the
ascendent
for
the
first
time
in
many
a
long
day
hear
her
just
as
if
her
vain
little
heart
did
tell
her
it
herself
but
the
moment
of
playfulness
was
a
rarity
and
all
the
more
enjoyed
for
that
the
papers
came
out
in
due
course
serially
and
created
a
new
sensation
and
brought
their
little
reward
but
they
also
plunged
their
author
into
a
succession
of
unsavory
quarrels
as
each
one
appeared
it
was
looked
for
with
eagerness
and
read
with
intense
interest
by
the
public
but
frequently
with
as
intense
anger
by
the
subject
perhaps
the
most
caustic
of
all
the
critiques
was
the
one
upon
the
work
of
thomas
dunn
english
whom
poe
contemptuously
dubbed
thomas
done
brown
english
bitterly
retorted
with
an
attack
upon
his
critic
private
character
a
fierce
controversy
followed
in
which
english
became
so
abusive
that
poe
sued
and
recovered
two
hundred
and
dollars
damages
which
goes
to
prove
that
even
an
ill
wind
can
blow
good
long
after
the
papers
had
been
published
the
scene
of
playful
idleness
with
all
its
holiday
charm
when
edgar
poe
drew
out
the
strips
of
manuscript
in
which
were
rolled
up
the
literati
of
new
york
remained
in
osgood
memory
and
in
his
own
to
him
it
was
indeed
a
gleam
of
brightness
amid
a
throng
of
earnest
woes
a
season
of
calm
in
a
tumultous
sea
but
as
been
said
why
dwell
upon
the
details
of
that
bleak
despairing
winter
spring
brought
a
change
which
makes
a
more
pleasant
picture
ever
since
they
had
left
philadelphia
the
poes
had
clung
in
memory
to
the
cottage
in
spring
garden
there
they
told
each
other
they
had
a
home
to
their
minds
it
was
the
dear
muddie
their
ever
faithful
earthly
providence
to
whom
they
were
already
so
deeply
indebted
who
discovered
in
the
suburb
of
fordham
a
tiny
cottage
which
had
much
of
the
charm
of
which
they
dreamed
even
to
the
infinitesimal
price
for
which
it
could
be
rented
it
was
only
a
story
and
a
half
high
but
there
was
a
commodious
and
cheerful
room
down
stairs
with
four
windows
and
from
the
narrow
hallway
a
quaint
little
winding
stair
led
to
an
attic
which
though
its
roof
was
low
and
sloping
contained
a
room
large
enough
to
serve
the
double
purpose
of
and
study
there
was
a
pleasant
porch
across
the
front
of
the
cottage
which
would
make
an
ideal
summer
and
study
when
the
upon
it
should
have
been
nursed
and
trained
to
screen
it
from
the
sun
the
cottage
stood
upon
a
green
hill
in
cherry
trees
just
then
in
full
bloom
and
filled
with
nearby
was
a
grove
of
pines
and
a
short
walk
away
was
the
harlem
river
with
its
picturesque
high
stone
bridge
it
was
an
abode
fit
to
be
in
paradise
edgar
told
virginia
and
the
mother
and
within
a
few
days
they
and
their
few
small
possessions
including
catalina
were
as
well
established
there
as
if
they
had
never
known
any
other
home
the
moving
in
recalled
the
earliest
days
of
their
life
at
spring
garden
again
muddie
was
busy
not
with
soap
and
water
only
but
with
the
whitewash
brush
again
their
hearts
were
blythe
with
the
pleasing
sense
of
change
of
the
opening
up
of
a
new
vista
of
there
was
no
knowing
what
happiness
just
as
children
welcome
any
change
for
the
change
itself
always
expecting
to
find
pleasant
surprises
upon
a
new
and
untried
road
but
there
was
a
difference
in
themselves
since
the
moving
into
the
spring
garden
cottage
which
had
been
so
gradual
that
they
were
scarcely
conscious
of
it
the
years
since
then
lay
heavily
upon
them
they
showed
plainly
in
the
deepened
lines
in
mother
clemm
face
in
the
deepened
anxiety
in
her
mater
dolorosa
eyes
in
the
frost
upon
the
locks
that
peeped
from
under
her
immaculate
widow
cap
they
showed
in
the
fragile
figure
of
virginia
once
so
full
of
sweet
curves
in
the
ethereal
look
that
had
come
into
the
once
rounded
cheeks
and
full
pouting
lips
in
the
transparency
of
her
skin
and
in
the
sweet
eyes
that
when
not
filled
with
the
merry
laughter
that
had
through
thick
and
thin
filled
her
dwelling
place
with
sunshine
and
music
had
a
faraway
expression
in
them
as
if
they
were
looking
into
another
world
they
showed
most
of
all
in
the
dreamer
himself
to
him
these
years
had
been
years
of
fierce
battle
battle
not
for
wealth
but
for
bread
battle
not
so
much
for
selfish
ambition
as
for
his
country
and
in
a
high
sense
for
he
had
fought
valiantly
to
win
a
place
for
america
in
the
world
of
letters
battle
with
himself
with
the
devils
that
sought
mastery
over
his
spirit
the
devil
of
excitement
and
exhilaration
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
cup
the
devil
of
blessed
forgetfulness
accompanied
by
magical
dreams
that
dwelt
in
the
heart
of
the
poppy
the
devil
of
melancholy
and
gloom
to
whom
he
felt
a
certain
charm
in
yielding
himself
the
devil
of
restlessness
and
dissatisfaction
with
whatsoever
lay
within
his
grasp
a
sort
of
desire
to
drop
the
prize
in
hand
in
a
chase
after
that
of
his
vision
the
impish
devil
of
the
perverse
at
times
he
had
been
victorious
at
other
times
there
had
been
defeat
but
always
the
warfare
had
been
fierce
and
the
scars
remained
to
tell
the
story
they
remained
in
the
emaciation
and
the
deep
lines
of
his
still
beautiful
face
remained
in
the
drooping
curves
of
the
mouth
remained
above
all
in
the
ineffable
sadness
of
the
large
deep
luminous
eyes
yet
that
sweet
spring
day
when
the
three
were
moving
into
fordham
cottage
the
years
that
had
wrought
upon
them
thus
were
as
they
had
not
been
their
little
possessions
had
dwindled
pitifully

had

of
the

gone
to
pay

debt

by
one
others
of
their
household
gods
had
provided
bread
but
the
spurt
of
prosperity
the
damages
recovered
in
the
thomas
done
brown
suit
brought
made
possible
a
new
checked
matting
for
the
floor
and
so
bright
and
clean
did
it
look
that
they
felt
it
almost
furnished
the
room
of
itself
it
would
mean
much
to
them
in
saving
the
dear
mother
the
most
laborious
feature
of
her
labor
it
was
a
more
difficult
matter
than
formerly
for
her
to
get
down
upon
her
knees
to
scrub
the
floor
and
it
had
become
impossible
for
the
frail
virginia
to
help
her
in
such
work
yet
as
long
as
the
floor
was
bare
she
had
kept
it
as
spotless
and
nearly
as
white
as
new
fallen
snow
when
the
matting
had
been
laid
eddie
took
her
beautiful
worn
hands
in
his
and
kissed
first
one
and
then
the
other
no
more
scrubbing
of
the
floor
dear
hands
he
playfully
said
in
addition
to
the
matting
there
were
in
the
way
of
furnishings
only
a
few
chairs
some
a
picture
or
two
vases
for
flowers
some
and
of
course
edgar
desk
above
the
desk
hung
the
of
helen
from
which
somehow
he
was
always
able
to
draw
inspiration
sometimes
the
wings
of
his
imagination
would
droop
his
pen
would
halt
in
desperation
he
would
look
up
at
the
could
it
be
he
would
ask
himself
that
her
spirit
had
come
to
dwell
in
this
representation
of
her
which
he
had
made
from
memory
her
eyes
seemed
to
look
at
him
through
the
eyes
in
the
picture
the
past
came
back
to
him
as
it
sometimes
did
when
the
mingled
scent
of
magnolias
and
roses
on
the
summer
night
air
placed
him
back
beneath
her
window
from
this
portrait
of
the
lovely
dead
upon
the
wall
from
the
miniature
of
the
lovely
dead
that
he
carried
always
next
his
heart
and
from
the
lovely
being
who
walked
in
life
by
his
side
but
toward
whose
bosom
death
had
this
long
time
pointed
a
warning
finger
came
all
his
inspiration
in
the
new
as
in
each
of
the
old
homes
upstairs
close
under
the
sloping
roof
was
the
bare
barer
than
the
one
below
for
there
was
no
checked
matting
upon
the
floor
and
there
were
only
such
pieces
of
furniture
as
were
an
absolute
necessity
but
against
a
small
window
in
the
end
of
the
room
leaned
a
great
the
windows
were
open
and
the
faint
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
floated
in
with
the
song
and
gossip
of
the
nesting
birds
edgar
and
virginia
laughed
together
like
happy
children
and
told
each
other
that
they
would
play
that
their
room
under
the
roof
was
a
nest
in
the
tree
which
was
so
much
more
poetical
than
living
in
an
attic
and
roundabout
the
cottage
on
the
green
hill
with
its
screen
of
blossoming
cherry
trees
and
hardby
its
dusky
grove
of
pines
and
its
views
of
the
river
and
walk
leading
to
the
bridge
the
three
who
lived
for
each
other
only
had
erelong
reconstructed
the
wonderful
the
valley
of
the
grass
and
the
cottage
at
fordham
became
a
mecca
to
the
literati
of
new
york
even
as
the
cottage
at
spring
garden
had
been
a
mecca
to
the
literati
of
philadelphia
among
those
who
made
pilgrimages
thither
were
many
of
the
starry
sisterhood
of
poetesses
chief
of
whom
was
the
fair
frances
osgood
yet
in
his
retirement
the
dreamer
enjoyed
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
left
spring
garden
long
intervals
of
relief
from
company
and
in
the
and
on
the
bridge
overlooking
the
river
he
found
what
his
soul
had
long
hungered
for
silence
and
solitude
under
their
influence
he
conceived
the
idea
of
a
new
work
a
more
ambitious
work
than
anything
he
had
hitherto
attempted
a
work
in
the
form
of
a
prose
poem
upon
no
less
subject
than
the
universe
whose
deep
secrets
it
was
designed
to
reveal
with
the
title
eureka
ah
dreamer
could
we
but
call
the
curtain
here
could
we
but
leave
you
in
your
cottage
on
the
overlooking
the
river
with
the
trees
full
of
blossom
and
music
about
it
and
the
wood
inviting
your
fancy
where
as
you
pace
back
and
forth
with
your
hands
clasped
behind
you
your
great
deep
eyes
are
filled
with
the
mellow
light
that
illumines
them
when
they
are
turned
inward
exploring
the
treasures
of
your
brain
leave
you
deep
in
the
high
joy
of
meditation
upon
god
universe
but
the
play
is
the
tragedy
and
it
is
only
for
the
dread
conqueror
to
give
the
word

chapter
xxxi
all
too
soon
the
wolf
scratched
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
on
fordham
hill
all
too
soon
the
shadow
that
had
so
often
enveloped
the
cottage
in
spring
garden
the
shadow
from
the
wing
of
the
angel
of
death
fell
upon
the
cottage
among
the
cherry
trees
the
dreamer
sat
before
his
desk
under
the
picture
of
helen
for
hours
and
hours
or
when
virginia
was
too
ill
to
be
up
at
a
little
table
beside
her
bed
in
the
chamber
which
was
like
a
nest
in
a
tree
in
fair
weather
and
foul
the
stately
figure
and
sorrowful
eyes
of
mother
clemm
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
streets
of
new
york
as
she
went
about
offering
the
narrow
rolls
of
manuscript
for
sale
as
fast
as
they
were
finished
or
trying
to
collect
the
little
checks
from
those
already
sold
and
published
yet
with
all
they
could
do
had
it
not
been
for
the
generous
gifts
of
friends
the
three
must
needs
have
succumbed
to
cold
and
hunger
and
all
the
time
the
poison
that
fell
from
rufus
tongue
was
at
work
even
the
visits
of
the
angels
of
mercy
who
ministered
to
him
and
his
invalid
wife
in
this
their
darkest
hour
were
made
by
the
working
of
this
poison
to
appear
as
things
of
evil
how
was
one
of
the
furtive
eye
and
the
black
heart
of
a
rufus
griswold
to
understand
love
of
woman
of
which
reverence
was
a
chief
ingredient
these
ministering
angels
osgood
gove
marie
louise
shew
and
others
whose
love
for
the
racked
and
broken
dreamer
and
for
herself
virginia
so
perfectly
understood
virginia
the
guileless
with
her
sense
for
spiritual
things
and
her
warm
responsive
heart
brought
to
the
cottage
not
only
encouragement
and
sympathy
but
medicines
and
delicacies
which
were
offered
in
such
manner
that
even
one
of
edgar
poe
sensitive
pride
could
accept
them
without
shame
summer
passed
and
autumn
and
winter
drew
on
filling
the
dwellers
in
fordham
cottage
with
fear
of
they
knew
not
what
miseries
there
had
been
ups
and
downs
there
had
been
happiness
and
woe
there
had
been
times
of
strength
and
times
of
weakness
of
weakness
when
the
dreamer
unable
to
hold
out
in
the
desperate
battle
of
life
as
he
knew
it
hungry
cold
and
heartbroken
at
the
sight
of
his
wife
with
that
faraway
look
in
her
eyes
had
fallen
had
sought
and
found
forgetfulness
only
to
know
a
horrible
awakening
that
was
despair
and
that
was
oftentimes
accompanied
by
illness
now
there
was
added
to
every
thing
else
the
knowledge
that
she
his
wife
his
heartsease
flower
and
the
mother
in
spite
of
all
his
striving
for
them
were
objects
of
charity
when
some
of
his
friends
in
the
kindness
of
their
hearts
published
in
one
of
the
papers
an
appeal
to
the
admirers
of
edgar
poe
work
for
aid
for
him
and
his
family
in
their
distress
he
came
out
in
a
proud
denial
of
their
need
for
aid
the
need
was
great
enough
god
knows
but
the
pitiful
exposure
was
more
painful
than
the
pangs
of
cold
and
hunger
at
last
the
day
drew
near
of
whose
approach
all
who
had
visited
the
cottage
knew
but
of
which
they
had
schooled
themselves
not
to
think
january
was
waning
for
many
days
the
ground
had
not
been
seen
the
branches
of
the
cherry
trees
gleamed
not
with
flowers
but
with
icicles
as
they
leaned
against
the
windows
of
the
under
the
roof
sometimes
as
the
winter
blast
stirred
them
they
knocked
against
the
panes
with
a
sound
the
knuckles
of
a
skeleton
might
have
made
there
was
not
the
slightest
suggestion
of
the
ligeia
in
that
harsh
horrible
sound
upon
the
bed
the
lay
well
nigh
as
still
and
as
white
as
the
snow
outside
now
and
again
she
coughed
a
weak
ghostly
sort
of
cough
over
her
wasted
body
in
addition
to
the
thin
lay
her
husband
old
military
cape
against
her
breast
nestled
catalina
purring
contentedly
while
she
kept
the
heart
of
her
mistress
warm
a
little
longer
near
the
foot
of
her
bed
the
mother
sat
a
more
perfect
picture
than
ever
of
the
mater
dolorosa
chafing
the
tiny
cold
feet
at
the
head
her
husband
bent
over
her
and
chafed
her
hands
about
the
room
but
not
near
enough
to
intrude
upon
the
sacred
grief
of
the
stricken
mother
and
husband
sat
several
of
the
good
women
whose
friendship
had
been
the
mainstay
of
the
three
through
the
window
gaining
brilliance
from
the
branches
outside
fell
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
glorifying
the
room
and
the
bed
scarce
a
word
was
spoken
but
upon
the
request
of
the
dying
girl
for
music
one
of
the
visitors
began
to
sing
in
low
tremulous
tones
the
beautiful
old
hymn
jerusalem
the
golden
to
the
man
bowed
beneath
his
woe
as
it
had
been
a
physical
weight
the
words
came
as
a
knell
and
a
blacker
despair
than
ever
settled
upon
his
wild
eyes
and
haggard
face
to
his
dying
wife
they
were
a
promise
the
smile
upon
her
lip
and
the
look
of
wonder
in
her
eyes
showed
that
she
was
already
beholding
the
glories
of
which
the
old
hymn
told
and
so
wandered
her
spirit
out
of
the
cold
and
the
want
and
the
gloom
that
had
darkened
and
chilled
the
valley
of
the
grass
into
the
regions
of
bliss
beyond
compare
but
her
husband
left
behind
was
as
the
man
in
his
own
story
silence
who
sat
upon
a
rock
the
gray
and
ghastly
rock
of
desolation
with
his
brow
lofty
with
thought
and
his
eyes
wild
with
care
and
the
fables
of
sorrow
and
weariness
and
disgust
with
mankind
written
in
furrows
upon
his
cheek
he
sat
upon
the
lonely
grey
rock
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
looked
out
upon
the
desolation
she
was
no
more
no
more
the
maiden
who
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
him
his
wife
in
all
the
storm
and
stress
of
his
troubled
life
his
true
heartsease
out
of
the
desolation
he
perceived
a
thing
that
was
formless
that
was
invisible
but
that
was
appalling
silence
that
made
him
shrink
and
quake
he
that
had
loved
had
longed
for
silence
silence
would
crush
him
now
and
solitude
how
often
he
had
craved
it
he
had
solitude
a
plenty
now
like
a
hunted
animal
he
looked
about
for
a
refuge
from
the
silence
and
the
solitude
that
gave
him
chase
but
he
knew
that
however
fast
he
might
flee
they
would
be
hard
on
his
heels
how
white
she
was
and
how
still
nevermore
to
hear
the
sounds
of
her
low
sweet
voice
nevermore
to
hear
her
merry
laughter
nevermore
her
light
that
like
her
voice
and
her
laugh
was
music
to
his
ears
nevermore
for
she
was
wrapped
in
the
silence
the
last
great
silence
of
all
nevermore
would
she
sit
beside
him
as
he
worked
or
plant
flowers
about
the
door
or
lay
her
hand
in
his
and
explore
with
him
the
wonderful
nevermore
lay
her
sweet
lips
upon
his
or
raise
the
lids
from
her
eyes
and
shine
on
him
from
under
their
long
jetty
fringes
henceforth
a
solitude
as
vast
as
the
silence
would
be
his
portion
their
sweet
friend
marie
louise
shew
robed
her
for
the
tomb
and
over
the
snow
they
bore
her
to
rest
in
a
vault
in
the
village
churchyard
then
for
many
weeks
edgar
poe
lay
in
the
under
the
roof
desperately
ill
for
the
most
part
unconscious
the
mother
bereaved
of
her
child
had
no
time
to
give
herself
over
to
mourning
for
as
she
had
wrestled
with
death
for
the
possession
of
a
son
when
he
was
first
given
into
her
keeping
even
more
fiercely
did
she
wrestle
now
that
he
must
be
son
and
daughter
too
the
kind
friends
who
had
made
virginia
last
days
comfortable
aided
her
in
the
battle
and
finally
the
victory
was
won
pale
shaken
the
personification
of
woe
made
beautiful
the
dreamer
came
forth
into
the
air
of
heaven
once
more
and
as
spring
opened
was
to
be
seen
as
of
old
walking
among
the
pines
or
beside
the
river
and
ever
and
anon
his
chastened
features
and
his
great
solemn
eyes
were
turned
skyward
especially
at
night
when
the
heavens
were
sown
with
stars
for
from
some
one
of
those
bright
worlds
peradventure
would
she
whose
absence
made
the
solitude
and
the
silence
be
looking
down
upon
him
and
as
he
gazed
and
dreamed
high
thoughts
took
form
in
his
brain
thoughts
of
the
material
and
spiritual
universe
its
essence
its
origin
its
creation
its
present
condition
and
its
destiny
thoughts
to
be
made
into
a
book
dedicated
to
those
who
feel
rather
than
to
those
who
think
to
the
dreamers
and
those
who
put
faith
in
dreams
as
in
the
only
realities
thoughts
for
his
projected
work
eureka
out
of
the
silence
and
the
solitude
came
the
development
and
completion
of
this
strange
prose
poem
like
an
uneasy
spirit
he
wandered
night
and
day
up
and
down
the
river
bank
in
the
wood
or
in
the
churchyard
that
held
the
tomb
of
his
virginia
meanwhile
the
mother
still
kept
the
cottage
bright
she
asked
no
questions
when
he
went
forth
night
or
day
or
when
he
came
in
night
or
day
but
her
heart
bled
for
him
and
sometimes
when
he
would
throw
himself
into
a
deep
chair
and
sit
by
the
hour
seemingly
staring
at
nothing
but
really
she
knew
by
the
harassed
and
brooding
look
in
the
great
deep
eyes
dreaming
dreams
no
mortal
ever
dared
to
dream
before
she
would
steal
gently
to
his
side
and
with
her
long
slim
expressive
fingers
stroke
the
large
brow
until
natural
sleep
brought
respite
from
painful
memories
her
ministrations
were
grateful
to
him
yet
he
was
barely
conscious
of
her
presence
not
even
for
her
and
far
less
for
any
other
human
being
did
he
feel
kinship
at
this
time
his
vision
when
not
turned
within
looked
far
beyond
human
companionship
to
the
wonders
of
the
universe
the
stars
and
the
mountains
and
the
forests
and
the
rivers
but
his
only
real
companion
was
his
own
stricken
heart
many
times
he
said
to
his
heart
in
the
prophetic
words
of
his
fantastic
creation
morella
thy
days
henceforth
shall
be
days
of
sorrow
that
sorrow
which
is
the
most
lasting
of
impressions
as
the
cypress
is
the
most
enduring
of
trees
for
the
hours
of
thy
happiness
are
over
and
joy
is
not
gathered
twice
in
a
lifetime
as
the
roses
of
paestum
twice
in
a
year
yet
as
the
back
is
fitted
to
the
burden
and
the
wind
tempered
to
the
shorn
lamb
so
again
as
in
his
early
griefs
the
sorrow
of
the
dreamer
was
not
all
pain
there
was
an
element
of
beauty
of
poetry
in
it
that
made
it
possible
to
be
endured
out
of
the
depths
of
the
solitude
and
the
silence
he
said
to
his
soul
it
is
a
happiness
to
wonder
it
is
a
happiness
to
dream
and
more
than
ever
before
in
his
life
his
whole
existence
had
become
a
dream
the
realities
being
mere
shadows
to
dream
to
wonder
to
work
to
work
to
wonder
to
dream
thus
were
the
hours
the
hours
of
sorrow
spent
the
hours
of
which
the
poet
lost
all
count
for
between
his
dreams
and
his
work
so
intensely
full
were
the
hours
of
vivid
mental
living
that
each
day
was
as
a
lifetime
in
itself
and
as
he
wandered
under
the
pines
or
along
the
river
wrapped
in
his
dreams
and
wondering
thoughts
of
heaven
and
earth
or
leaned
from
the
window
of
the
chamber
under
the
low
sloping
roof
the
chamber
that
had
been
the
chamber
of
death
and
looked
beyond
the
embowering
cherry
trees
upon
the
sky
or
at
dead
of
night
sat
under
his
lamp
pondering
over
his
books
always
everywhere
he
listened
listened
for
the
voice
and
the
of
virginia
as
he
had
listened
in
his
earlier
days
for
the
voice
and
the
footfalls
of
the
mythical
ligeia
for
had
she
not
promised
that
she
would
watch
over
him
in
spirit
and
if
possible
give
him
frequent
indications
of
her
presence
sighing
upon
him
in
the
evening
winds
or
filling
the
air
which
he
breathed
with
perfume
from
the
censers
of
the
angels
and
her
promises
were
faithfully
kept
for
often
as
he
listened
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
swinging
of
the
censers
of
the
angels
and
streams
of
a
holy
perfume
floated
about
him
and
when
his
heart
beat
heavily
the
winds
that
bathed
his
brow
came
to
him
laden
with
soft
sighs
and
indistinct
murmurs
filled
the
night
air
and
so
the
green
spring
and
the
flowery
summer
passed
and
autumn
drew
on
then
came
a
day
of
days
a
soft
october
day
when
merely
to
exist
was
to
be
happy
and
to
hope
and
new
life
like
some
sweet
rejuvenating
cordial
seemed
to
enter
and
course
through
the
veins
of
the
dreamer
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
silence
and
the
solitude
had
enveloped
the
cottage
he
laughed
as
he
flung
wide
the
windows
of
the
chamber
that
had
been
the
chamber
of
death
to
let
in
the
day
and
as
he
looked
forth
he
said
again
quoting
the
words
of
his
morella
the
winds
lie
still
in
heaven
there
is
a
dim
moisture
over
all
the
earth
and
a
warm
glow
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
forest
a
rainbow
a
bow
of
promise
from
the
firmament
has
surely
fallen
it
is
not
a
day
for
sorrow
but
for
joy
for
it
is
a
day
out
of
aidenn
itself
and
i
feel
that
ere
it
has
passed
i
shall
hold
sweeter
more
real
communion
with
her
that
is
in
aidenn
than
ever
before
he
went
forth
and
wandered
through
the
radiance
of
that
perfect
day
hours
on
hours
and
as
he
paced
the
solemn
aisles
of
the
pine
wood
or
strolled
along
the
river
walk
which
was
veiled
in
a
golden
haze
and
carpeted
thick
with
the
yellow
and
crimson
and
brown
leaves
of
october
he
heard
clearly
the
sound
of
the
swinging
of
the
censers
of
the
angels
as
his
senses
were
bathed
in
the
holy
perfume
and
the
zephyrs
that
blew
about
his
brow
were
laden
with
audible
sweet
murmurs
as
evening
fell
a
pleasant
languor
possessed
his
limbs
a
wholesome
weariness
from
his
long
wanderings
and
he
lay
down
upon
a
bank
littered
with
fallen
leaves
and
slept
and
as
he
slept
in
the
fading
light
the
spirit
of
virginia
approached
him
more
nearly
more
tangibly
than
ever
before
and
finally
when
the
red
sun
had
sunk
into
the
river
and
when
the
afterglow
in
the
sky
and
the
rainbow
that
lay
upon
the
forest
were
alike
blotted
out
by
the
shadows
of
night
and
the
moon
a
lustrous
blur
through
the
haze
wandered
uncertainly
up
the
sky
she
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
pressed
a
fluttering
kiss
such
a
kiss
as
a
butterfly
might
bestow
upon
a
flower
upon
his
lips
then
sighing
drew
away
the
sleeper
awoke
with
a
start
a
start
of
heavenly
bliss
followed
by
instant
pain
for
as
he
peered
into
the
night
he
saw
that
he
was
alone
with
the
silence
and
the
solitude
the
winds
lay
still
in
heaven
and
bore
him
no
whisper
or
sigh
the
perfume
from
the
censers
of
the
angels
still
filled
the
air
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
great
void
a
pain
unbearable
the
kiss
had
awakened
a
thousand
thronging
memories
the
kiss
had
robbed
of
their
charm
the
elusive
perfume
and
the
ghostly
whisper
of
fluttering
garments
and
the
shadowy
and
the
faint
faraway
sighs
henceforth
these
would
cease
to
satisfy
the
kiss
had
made
him
know
the
want
of
his
heart
for
love
and
companionship
such
as
the
living
virginia
had
given
him
he
listened
and
listened
but
the
winds
lay
still
in
heaven
and
he
was
alone
with
the
silence
the
dread
silence
and
the
and
the
despair
then
he
arose
from
his
bed
of
withered
and
sere
leaves
and
as
one
distraught
wandered
through
the
shadows
of
the
misty
weird
night
in
the
wood
and
by
the
waters
he
wandered
while
the
night
wore
on
and
the
moon
held
its
way
still
a
lustrous
blur
in
the
heavens
on
on
he
wandered
seeking
peace
for
his
soul
and
finding
none
till
the
moon
was
out
and
the
stars
fainted
in
the
twilight
of
the
approaching
day
when
lo
above
the
end
of
the
path
through
the
wood
the
morning
star
astarte
bediamonded
crescent
arose
upon
his
vision
and
as
he
gazed
with
wonder
and
delight
upon
the
beautiful
star
hope
was
born
anew
in
his
heart
for
he
said
it
is
the
star
of
love
he
that
had
always
looked
for
signs
in
the
skies
had
he
not
found
one
what
could
it
mean
this
rising
of
the
star
of
love
upon
the
hour
of
his
bitterest
need
but
a
sign
of
hope
of
peace
vainly
did
his
soul
upbraid
him
and
warn
him
not
to
trust
the
beacon
to
fly
from
its
alluring
light
and
cast
aside
its
spell
all
deaf
to
the
warning
he
eagerly
followed
the
star
which
promised
renewal
of
hope
and
love
and
relief
from
the
solitude
and
the
silence
the
desolation
that
the
kiss
had
made
so
real
and
intolerable
but
alas
as
he
wandered
on
and
on
his
eyes
upon
the
star
his
feet
following
blindly
without
marking
the
path
into
which
they
had
turned
his
progress
was
suddenly
checked
through
the
misty
twilight
of
the
approaching
dawn
there
loomed
an
obstacle
to
his
steps
it
was
with
horror
unspeakable
that
he
recognized
the
vault
in
which
lay
in
her
last
sleep
his
loved
virginia
then
his
heart
it
grew
ashen
and
sober
as
the
leaves
that
were
crispéd
and
sere
as
the
leaves
that
were
withering
and
sere
the
star
of
love
was
fading
in
the
eastern
sky
and
through
the
ghostly
dawn
he
turned
and
fled
aghast
to
the
cottage
among
the
cherry
trees
mother
clemm
who
had
lain
waiting
and
watching
for
him
all
night
arose
from
her
uneasy
couch
when
she
heard
the
latch
of
the
gate
lifted
and
opened
the
door
he
came
in
and
walked
past
her
like
a
wraith
his
eyes
were
wild
his
face
was
bloodless
and
haggard
his
hair
damp
and
disordered
the
mother
eyes
were
filled
with
dumb
pain
he
suffered
her
to
take
his
hand
in
hers
and
to
gaze
into
his
eyes
with
pity
and
even
raised
the
hand
that
held
his
own
to
his
lips
as
though
to
reassure
her
but
he
spake
no
word
made
no
attempt
at
explanation
and
she
asked
no
questions
for
a
moment
he
remained
beside
her
then
straight
to
his
desk
he
walked
and
began
arranging
writing
materials
before
him
while
she
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
and
started
a
blaze
under
a
pot
of
coffee
that
stood
upon
the
little
stove
he
wrote
rapidly
furiously
without
pausing
for
thought
or
for
the
fastidious
choice
of
words
that
was
apt
to
make
him
halt
frequently
in
the
act
of
composition
and
the
words
that
he
wrote
were
the
wild
words
wild
but
beautiful
and
moving
as
an
echo
from
israfel
own
lute
of
the
poem
ulalume
the
skies
they
were
ashen
and
sober
the
leaves
they
were
crispéd
and
sere
the
leaves
they
were
withering
and
sere
it
was
night
in
the
lonesome
october
of
my
most
immemorial
year
after
that
eventful
night
a
change
came
over
him
that
sat
upon
the
rock
of
desolation
the
solitude
and
the
silence
still
enfolded
him
but
the
star
of
love
had
arisen
in
his
firmament
ushering
in
a
new
day
and
new
hope
to
his
soul
and
he
no
longer
trembled
as
he
sat
upon
the
rock
but
with
new
energy
he
worked
and
with
exceeding
patience
he
waited
and
as
he
worked
interest
in
life
returned
to
him
and
ambition
returned
one
day
he
copied
ulalume
upon
a
long
narrow
slip
of
paper
and
rolled
it
into
one
of
the
tight
little
rolls
that
all
the
editors
knew
and
mother
clemm
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
city
especially
on
account
of
it
first
she
tried
it
at
union
which
promptly
rejected
it
it
was
too
queer
the
editor
said
but
american
agreed
to
take
it
and
to
print
it
without
signature
for
this
poem
must
be
published
anonymously
if
at
all
the
poet
insisted
it
soon
afterward
appeared
and
willis
copied
it
into
the
next
number
of
home
with
complimentary
editorial
comment
the
result
was
a
new
sensation
the
reader
everywhere
declared
himself
to
be
brought
under
a
magic
spell
by
the
words
of
this
remarkable
poem
though
he
frankly
owned
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
them
which
was
as
edgar
poe
intended
even
the
old
dream
of
founding
a
magazine
returned
and
possessed
him
as
it
had
so
often
possessed
him
before
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
magazine
which
he
still
proposed
to
name
that
he
determined
to
give
his
new
work
eureka
as
a
lecture
in
various
places
he
did
give
it
once
in
new
york
coming
out
of
his
seclusion
for
the
first
time
upon
a
frosty
february
night
the
rhapsody
delivered
in
his
low
but
musical
and
dramatic
tones
thrilled
his
audience
but
it
was
a
small
audience
and
when
soon
afterward

chapter
xxxii
autumn
with
its
enchanted
october
night
and
winter
filled
with
work
and
spent
in
deep
seclusion
at
fordham
and
spring
with
its
revival
of
plans
for
and
the
appearance
of
eureka
as
a
book
and
its
author
return
to
the
world
as
a
lecturer
slipped
by
about
midsummer
the
dreamer
lay
a
night
in
the
old
town
of
providence
it
was
a
warm
night
and
the
window
of
his
room
was
open
letting
in
a
flood
of
light
from
the
full
moon
he
leaned
from
the
window
which
looked
upon
a
plot
of
flowers
whose
many
odors
rising
enveloped
him
in
incense
sweet
as
the
incense
from
the
censers
of
the
angels
when
the
spirit
of
his
virginia
was
near
but
it
was
not
of
virginia
that
the
fragrance
told
him
tonight
something
about
the
blended
odors
combined
with
the
sensuous
warmth
of
the
night
and
the
light
of
the
moon
transported
him
suddenly
magically
back
through
the
years
to
his
boyhood
and
to
the
little
room
in
the
allan
cottage
on
clay
street
hanging
like
this
room
over
a
space
of
flowers
the
night
following
the
day
when
he
had
first
seen
rob
stanard
mother
back
back
into
the
long
dead
past
he
wandered
the
broken
and
jaded
edgar
poe
was
dreaming
again
the
dream
of
the
fresh
enthusiastic
boy
edgar
poe
how
every
incident
of
that
day
and
night
stood
out
in
his
memory
he
could
feel
again
the
wonder
that
he
felt
when
he
saw
the
beautiful
helen
standing
against
the
in
the
garden
could
see
her
graceful
approach
to
meet
and
greet
him
the
lonely
orphan
boy
could
hear
her
gracious
words
in
praise
of
his
mother
while
she
held
his
hand
in
both
her
own
as
he
lived
it
all
over
again
with
the
silver
moonlight
enfolding
him
and
the
breath
of
the
flowers
filling
his
nostrils
a
clock
somewhere
in
the
house
struck
the
night
noon
hour
he
started
even
so
it
had
been
that
other
night
in
the
long
past
he
half
believed
that
if
he
should
go
forth
into
this
night
as
he
had
gone
into
that
he
should
see
once
more
the
lady
of
his
dream
with
the
lamp
in
her
hand
framed
in
the
window
and
seeing
worship
as
he
had
worshipped
then
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
he
arose
and
hurrying
down
the
stair
was
in
the
street
the
streets
were
strange
to
him
but
there
was
a
pleasant
sense
of
adventure
in
wandering
through
them
he
knew
not
whither
and
the
sweet
airs
of
the
flowers
were
everywhere
suddenly
he
stopped
while
all
the
town
slept
there
was
one
beside
himself
who
kept
vigil
clad
all
in
white
she
half
reclined
upon
a
violet
bank
in
an
old
garden
where
the
moon
fell
on
the
upturned
faces
of
a
thousand
roses
and
on
her
own
upturned
alas
in
sorrow
faint
with
the
beauty
and
the
poetry
of
the
scene
he
leaned
upon
the
gate
of
the
enchanted
garden
where
no
wind
dared
to
stir
unless
on
tiptoe
he
dared
not
speak
or
give
any
sign
of
his
presence
but
he
gazed
and
gazed
until
to
his
entranced
eyes
it
seemed
that
the
pearly
lustre
of
the
moon
went
out
the
mossy
banks
and
the
meandering
paths
the
happy
flowers
and
the
repining
trees
were
seen
no
more
all
was
lost
to
his
vision
save
only
the
divine
light
in
those
eyes
save
but
the
soul
in
those
uplifted
eyes
he
continued
to
gaze
until
the
moon
disappeared
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
and
he
watched
the
figure
glide
away
like
a
ghost
amid
the
entombing
trees
yet
still
it
seemed
to
him
the
eyes
remained
they
lighted
his
lonely
footsteps
home
that
night
and
he
told
himself
that
they
would
light
him
henceforth
through
the
years
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
that
october
night
when
the
star
of
love
ushering
in
a
new
morning
had
prophesied
to
him
of
new
hope
nearly
a
year
through
which
he
had
waited
patiently
but
not
in
vain
the
time
had
evidently
come
for
the
prophecy
to
be
fulfilled
and
fate
had
led
him
to
this
town
and
the
spot
in
this
town
where
she
that
was
to
be
he
was
convinced
the
hope
the
guide
the
savior
of
his
lonesome
latter
years
awaited
him
who
was
she
so
so
ethereal
she
seemed
as
robed
in
white
and
veiled
in
silvery
she
sat
among
the
slumbering
roses
and
as
she
was
gathered
into
the
shadows
of
the
entombing
trees
that
she
might
almost
have
been
the
lady
ligeia
yet
he
knew
that
she
was
not
the
lady
ligeia
had
been
but
the
creation
of
his
own
brain
very
fair
she
had
been
to
his
dreaming
vision
very
sweet
her
companionship
had
been
to
his
imagination
sufficient
for
all
the
needs
of
his
being
in
his
youthful
days
when
sorrow
was
but
a
beautiful
sentiment
when
terror
was
not
fright
but
a
tremulous
delight
but
how
was
such
an
one
as
she
to
bind
up
the
broken
heart
of
a
man
it
was
the
element
in
the
eyes
of
her
that
sat
among
the
roses
that
enchained
him
ethereal
as
she
was
the
eyes
upturned
in
sorrow
were
the
eyes
of
no
spirit
but
of
a
woman
from
them
looked
a
human
soul
with
the
capacity
and
the
experience
to
offer
sympathy
meet
for
human
needs
the
needs
even
of
a
man
how
dark
the
woe
how
sublime
the
hope
how
intense
the
pride
how
daring
the
ambition
how
deep
how
fathomless
the
capacity
for
love
that
looked
as
from
a
window
from
those
eyes
upturned
in
sorrow
in
the
moonlight
while
all
the
town
slept
who
was
she
this
lady
of
sorrows
and
by
what
sweet
name
was
she
known
to
the
citizens
of
this
old
town
surely
fate
that
had
brought
her
to
the
bank
of
violets
beneath
the
moon
fate
that
had
led
him
to
her
garden
gate
would
in
fate
own
time
reveal
as
helen
whitman
flitted
as
noiselessly
as
the
ghost
she
seemed
to
be
up
the
dark
stairway
to
her
chamber
and
without
closing
the
casement
that
admitted
the
moonlight
and
the
garden
odors
lay
down
upon
her
canopied
bed
she
trembled
what
was
it
that
she
had
been
aware
of
in
the
garden
that
presence
that
consciousness
of
communion
between
her
spirit
and
his
upon
whom
all
her
thoughts
had
dwelt
of
late
herself
a
poet
from
her
earliest
knowledge
of
the
work
of
edgar
poe
she
had
seemed
to
feel
a
kinship
between
her
mind
and
his
such
as
she
had
known
in
regard
to
no
other
she
had
followed
his
career
step
by
step
and
out
of
the
many
sorrows
of
her
own
life
had
been
born
deep
sympathy
for
him
since
his
last
greatest
blow
she
had
more
than
ever
mourned
with
him
in
spirit
for
she
too
was
widowed
she
too
had
sat
upon
the
rock
of
desolation
and
knew
the
silence
and
the
solitude
she
and
the
dreamer
had
at
least
one
mental
trait
in
common
a
tendency
toward
spiritualism
a
more
than
half
belief
in
the
communion
of
the
spirits
of
the
dead
with
those
of
the
living
and
of
those
of
the
living
with
each
other
what
had
led
her
into
the
moonlit
garden
when
all
the
world
slept
she
knew
not
she
only
knew
that
she
had
felt
an
impelling
influence
a
call
to
her
spirit
to
come
out
among
the
slumbering
roses
she
had
not
questioned
nor
sought
to
define
it
she
had
heard
it
and
she
had
obeyed
and
then
the
presence
she
had
never
seen
edgar
poe
yet
she
felt
that
he
had
been
there
in
the
spirit
if
not
in
the
flesh
she
had
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
eyes
and
she
had
half
expected
him
to
step
from
the
shadows
around
her
and
to
say
i
upon
whom
your
thoughts
have
dwelt
i
who
am
the
comrade
and
the
complement
of
your
inner
life
i
whose
spirit
called
to
you
ere
you
came
into
the
garden
i
am
here
it
was
almost
immediately
upon
the
dreamer
return
to
fordham
and
when
he
was
still
under
the
spell
of
the
night
at
providence
that
the
identity
of
the
lady
of
the
garden
was
revealed
to
him
in
a
manner
seemingly
accidental
but
which
he
felt
to
be
but
another
manifestation
of
the
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
some
casual
words
concerning
the
appearance
and
character
of
whitman
spoken
by
a
casual
visitor
lifted
the
curtain
so
the
lady
of
the
garden
was
helen
whitman
whose
poetry
had
impressed
him
favorably
and
whose
acquaintance
he
had
desired
helen
whitman
as
he
repeated
the
name
his
heart
stood
still
even
in
her
name
he
heard
the
voice
of
fate
the
name
of
the
good
angel
of
his
boyhood
were
his
dreams
of
morella
and
of
ligeia
to
come
true
was
he
to
know
in
reality
the
miracle
he
had
imagined
and
written
of
in
these
two
phantasies
the
reincarnation
of
personal
identity
was
he
in
this
second
helen
in
this
second
garden
to
find
again
the
worshipped
helen
of
his
boyhood
he
turned
to
the
lines
he
had
written
so
long
ago
in
richmond
when
he
had
gone
forth
into
the
midsummer
moonlight
even
as
he
had
gone
forth
in
providence
and
had
worshipped
under
a
window
even
as
he
had
worshipped
at
a
garden
gate
he
read
the
first
two
stanzas
through
as
he
read
he
gave
himself
up
to
an
overwhelming
sense
of
fatality
could
anything
be
more
fitting
more
descriptive
the
end
of
the
days
of
miracles
was
not
yet
this
his
helen
of
a
thousand
dreams
his
impulse
was
to
seek
an
introduction
at
once
but
this
seemed
too
tamely
conventional
besides
he
was
in
the
hands
of
fate
he
dared
not
stir
fate
having
so
clearly
manifested
itself
would
find
a
way
his
correspondence
was
always
heavy
letters
clippings
from
papers
and
so
forth
came
to
him
by
every
post
from
friends
and
from
enemies
with
and
without
signatures
yet
from
all
the
mass
he
knew
at
once
that
the
valentine
unsigned
as
it
was
was
from
her
by
way
of
acknowledgment
he
turned
down
a
page
of
a
copy
of
the
raven
and
other
poems
at
the
lines
to
helen
and
mailed
it
to
her
he
waited
in
anxious
suspense
for
a
reply
but
the
lady
was
coy
days
passed
and
still
no
answer
the
desire
for
communication
with
her
became
irresistible
and
taking
pen
and
paper
he
wrote
at
the
top
of
the
page
even
as
long
ago
he
had
written
the
words
to
helen
and
underneath
wrote
a
new
poem
especially
for
this
new
helen
in
which
he
described
the
vision
of
her
in
the
garden
but
placing
it
in
the
far
past
and
his
feelings
as
he
gazed
upon
her
i
saw
thee
once
once
only
years
ago
i
must
not
say
many
but
not
many
clad
all
in
white
upon
a
violet
bank
i
saw
thee
half
reclining
while
the
moon
fell
on
the
upturned
faces
of
the
roses
and
on
thine
own
upturned
alas
in
sorrow
was
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
was
it
not
fate
whose
name
is
also
sorrow
that
bade
me
pause
before
that
to
breathe
the
incense
of
those
slumbering
roses
no
footstep
stirred
the
hated
world
all
slept
save
only
thee
and
me
oh
heaven
oh
god
how
my
heart
beats
in
coupling
those
two
words
save
only
thee
and
me
the
paper
trembled
in
the
hands
tiny
and
of
helen
whitman
her
soul
answered
emphatically
it
fate
so
he
had
been
there
in
the
flesh
near
her
in
the
shadows
of
that
mystic
night
the
presence
was
no
creation
of
an
overwrought
imagination
it
was
fate
tremulously
she
penned
her
answer
to
his
appeal
but
was
it
fate
again
which
caused
the
letter
to
miscarry
it
reached
him
finally
in
richmond
of
all
places
whither
he
had
gone
to
deliver
to
audiences
of
his
old
friends
his
lecture
upon
the
poetic
principle
in
the
interest
of
the
establishment
of
his
magazine
what
could
have
been
more
fitting
than
that
the
gracious
words
of
helen
of
a
thousand
dreams
should
come
to
him
in
richmond
not
many
days
later
and
he
was
under
her
own
roof
in
providence
he
waited
in
the
dimness
of
her
curtained
ear
strained
for
the
first
sound
of
her
footstep
noiselessly
as
a
sunbeam
or
a
shadow
she
entered
the
room
her
gauzy
white
draperies
floating
about
her
slight
figure
as
she
came
while
his
great
eyes
drank
in
with
reverent
joy
each
detail
of
her
ethereal
loveliness
her
face
the
same
he
had
seen
in
the
garden
pale
as
a
pearl
and
as
softly
radiant
and
framed
in
clustering
dark
ringlets
which
escaped
in
profusion
from
the
confinement
of
a
lacy
widow
cap
the
tremulous
mouth
the
eyes
mysterious
and
unearthly
from
which
the
soul
looked
out
for
one
moment
she
paused
in
the
doorway
her
hand
pressed
upon
her
wildly
beating
heart
then
with
hesitating
step
advanced
to
meet
him
her
words
of
greeting
were
few
and
so
low
and
faltering
as
to
be
quite
unintelligible
but
the
tones
of
her
voice
fell
on
his
ear
like
strangely
familiar
music
the
man
spoke
no
word
as
her
eyes
rested
for
one
brief
moment
upon
his
then
fell
before
the
intensity
of
his
gaze
he
was
conscious
of
spiritual
influences
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
in
a
tremulous
ecstacy
he
bent
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
the
hand
that
lay
within
his
own
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
restrained
himself
from
falling
upon
his
knees
before
her
in
actual
worship
three
evenings
of
all
heavenly
delight
he
spent
in
her
companionship
sometimes
in
the
seclusion
and
dusk
of
her
quiet
sometimes
walking
among
the
roses
in
her
garden
or
among
the
mossy
tombs
in
the
town
cemetery
their
sympathetic
natures
finding
expression
in
such
conversation
as
poets
delight
in
under
the
intoxicating
spell
of
her
presence
all
other
dreams
passed
for
the
time
into
nothingness
and
he
passionately
cried
helen
i
love
now
for
the
first
and
only
time
yet
he
was
poor
and
the
weaknesses
which
had
caused
him
to
fall
in
the
past
might
cause
him
to
fall
in
the
future
how
could
he
plead
for
a
return
of
his
love
his
very
made
his
plea
more
strong
still
she
did
not
yield
too
suddenly
true
she
too
was
under
the
spell
but
she
resisted
it
as
he
found
his
voice
and
his
eloquence
filled
the
room
a
restlessness
possessed
her
now
she
sat
quite
still
by
his
side
now
rose
and
wandered
about
the
apartment
now
stood
with
her
hand
resting
upon
the
back
of
his
chair
while
his
nearness
thrilled
her
there
were
objections
she
told
him
she
was
older
than
he
has
the
soul
age
helen
he
answered
her
can
immortality
regard
time
can
that
which
began
never
and
shall
never
end
consider
a
few
wretched
years
of
its
incarnate
life
do
you
not
perceive
that
it
is
my
diviner
nature
my
spiritual
being
that
burns
and
pants
to
commingle
with
your
own
she
urged
her
frail
health
as
an
objection
for
that
he
would
love
worship
her
the
more
he
said
he
plead
for
her
pity
upon
his
loneliness
his
sorrows
and
swore
that
he
would
comfort
and
soothe
her
in
hers
through
life
and
when
death
should
come
joyfully
go
down
with
her
into
the
night
of
the
grave
finally
he
appealed
to
her
ambition
was
i
right
helen
in
my
first
impression
of
you
in
the
impression
that
you
are
ambitious
if
so
and
if
you
will
have
faith
in
me
i
can
and
will
satisfy
your
wildest
desires
would
it
not
be
glorious
to
establish
in
america
the
sole
unquestionable
aristocracy
that
of
the
intellect
to
secure
its
supremacy
to
lead
and
control
it
still
the
that
so
often
seemed
trembling
upon
her
lips
was
not
spoken
she
received
his
almost
daily
letters
and
his
frequent
visits
listened
to
his
rapturous
trembling
blushing
letting
him
see
that
she
was
under
the
spell
that
she
loved
him
indeed
she
could
not
have
helped
his
seeing
it
had
she
wished
but
when
he
spoke
of
marriage
she
hesitated
tantalizing
him
to
the
point
of
madness
almost
what
was
it
that
held
her
back
she
too
believed
that
it
was
the
hand
of
fate
that
had
brought
them
together
that
they
were
to
cheer
each
other
latter
years
to
establish
that
intellectual
aristocracy
of
which
he
dreamed
yet
she
shrank
from
taking
the
step
when
his
great
solemn
eyes
were
upon
her
his
beautiful
face
pale
and
haggard
with
excess
of
feeling
turned
toward
her
his
eloquent
words
of
love
in
her
ears
she
sat
as
one
entranced
bewitched
yet
she
would
not
give
the
word
he
longed
for
the
word
of
willingness
to
embark
with
him
upon
the
sea
of
life
checked
her
such
an
uncharted
sea
it
seemed
to
her
she
dared
not
say
him
yea
the
truth
was
the
poison
was
working
the
griswold
poison
the
wildest
rumors
came
to
her
ears
of
the
worse
than
follies
of
her
lover
she
knew
that
they
were
at
least
overdrawn
possibly
altogether
false
yet
they
frightened
her
do
you
know
helen
whitman
wrote
one
of
the
dreamer
enemies
to
griswold
of
course
you
have
heard
it
rumored
that
she
is
to
marry
poe
well
she
has
seemed
to
me
a
good
girl
and
you
know
what
poe
is
has
whitman
no
friend
in
your
knowledge
that
can
faithfully
explain
poe
to
her
but
rufus
griswold
had
already
explained
poe
to
those
whom
he
knew
would
take
pains
to
pass
the
explanation
on
to
helen
had
dropped
the
poison
where
he
reckoned
it
would
work
with
the
greatest
speed
and
effect
the
explanation
with
the
usual
indirectness
of
a
griswold
was
sugared
with
a
compliment
poe
has
great
intellectual
power
he
said
with
emphasis
intellectual
power
but
he
added
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
the
furtive
eye
and
a
confidential
drop
in
the
voice
but
he
has
no
principle
no
moral
sense
the
poison
reached
the
destination
for
which
it
was
intended
the
ears
of
helen
whitman
in
due
course
and
it
terrified
her
as
had
none
of
the
rumors
she
had
heard
before
still
her
lover
floundered
in
the
dark
baffled
wondering
not
able
to
make
her
out
why
did
she
tantalize
him
torture
him
thus
keeping
him
dangling
between
heaven
and
hell
he
asked
himself
and
he
asked
her
over
and
over
again
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
there
was
a
reason
what
was
it
finally
she
gave
it
to
him
in
its
baldness
and
its
brutality
just
as
it
had
come
to
her
wrote
it
to
him
in
a
letter
it
brought
him
a
rude
awakening
from
his
dream
of
bliss
that
such
a
charge
should
be
brought
against
him
at
all
was
bitter
enough
but
that
it
could
be
repeated
to
him
by
helen
seemed
unbelievable
you
do
not
love
me
he
sadly
wrote
in
reply
or
you
would
not
have
written
these
terrible
words
then
he
swore
a
great
oath
by
the
god
who
reigns
in
heaven
i
swear
to
you
that
my
soul
is
incapable
of
dishonor
that
with
the
exception
of
occasional
follies
and
excesses
which
i
bitterly
lament
but
to
which
i
have
been
driven
by
intolerable
sorrow
i
can
call
to
mind
no
act
of
my
life
which
would
bring
a
blush
to
my
cheek
or
to
yours
he
followed
the
letter
with
a
visit
again
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
and
thrilling
her
with
his
eloquence
and
with
the
magic
of
his
personality
she
gave
him
a
half
promise
and
said
she
would
write
to
him
in
lowell
where
he
had
engaged
to
deliver
a
lecture
in
this
town
was
a
which
was
a
haven
of
rest
to
the
dreamer
beneath
it
dwelt
his
friend
and
confidant
annie
richmond
his
sweet
sister
as
he
loved
to
call
her
and
there
he
waited
with
a
chastened
joy
for
he
felt
assured
that
the
long
wished
for
was
about
to
be
said
yet
dared
not
give
himself
over
prematurely
to
the
ecstacy
that
would
soon
be
his
in
the
pleasant
friendly
family
circle
of
the
richmonds
he
sat
during
those
chill
november
evenings
seeing
pictures
in
the
glowing
fire
as
he
held
sweet
annie
sympathetic
hand
in
his
while
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
was
the
ticking
of
the
grandfather
clock
in
a
shadowy
corner
thus
quietly
patiently
he
waited
but
in
providence
the
griswold
poison
was
at
work
all
the
friends
and
relatives
of
helen
were
possessed
of
full
vials
of
it
which
they
industriously
poured
into
her
ears
against
it
the
recollection
of
the
night
in
the
garden
and
her
belief
that
fate
had
ordained
her
union
with
the
poet
had
no
avail
the
letter
that
she
sent
her
lover
was
more
colder
than
any
he
had
received
from
her
before
yet
there
was
still
enough
of
indecision
in
it
to
keep
him
tantalized
in
a
state
of
mind
well
nigh
distraction
he
bade
annie
and
her
cheerful
fireside
farewell
and
set
his
face
toward
providence
but
he
went
in
a
dream
the
demon
despair
possessing
him
unstrung
unmanned
almost
bereft
of
reason
his
old
dissatisfaction
with
himself
and
the
world
overtook
him
a
longing
to
be
out
of
it
all
for
forgetfulness
for
peace
yea
even
the
peace
of
the
grave
why
not
a
passionate
longing
a
homesickness
for
the
sure
the
steadfast
the
unvariable
love
of
his
beautiful
virginia
consumed
him
oh
if
he
could
but
lie
down
and
sleep
and
forget
until
one
sweet
day
he
should
wake
in
the
land
where
she
awaited
him
and
where
they
would
construct
anew
and
for
eternity
the
valley
of
the
grass
he
listened
for
the
first
time
since
the
star
of
love
had
ushered
in
a
new
day
in
his
life
he
heard
the
swinging
of
the
censers
of
the
angels
he
inhaled
the
incense
he
heard
the
voice
of
virginia
in
the
sighing
wind
she
seemed
to
call
to
him
i
am
coming
heartsease
he
whispered
as
he
quaffed
the
potion
that
he
reckoned
would
bear
him
to
her
but
it
was
not
to
be
when
he
awaked
weak
and
ill
but
sane
he
found
himself
with
friends
calmness
and
strength
returned
and
with
them
horror
at
the
deed
he
had
so
nearly
committed
and
deep
contrition
with
all
haste
he
again
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
helen
beseeching
her
to
marry
him
at
once
and
save
him
as
he
believed
she
only
could
from
himself
and
the
consequences
of
her
indecision
making
her
more
alarmed
for
him
than
she
had
formerly
been
for
herself
she
agreed
to
an
engagement
though
not
to
immediate
marriage
he
returned
to
fordham
and
to
faithful
mother
clemm
a
wreck
of
his
former
self
but
engaged
to
be
married
yet
he
was
not
happy
a
new
horror
possessed
him
as
in
the
night
when
the
star
of
love
first
rose
upon
his
vigil
it
had
stopped
over
the
door
of
a
legended
tomb
so
now
again
was
his
pathway
closed
turn
which
way
he
would
the
tomb
of
virginia
seemed
to
frown
upon
him
he
remembered
his
promise
to
her
that
upon
no
other
daughter
of
earth
would
he
look
with
the
eyes
of
love
vainly
did
he
seek
to
justify
himself
to
his
own
heart
for
breaking
the
promise
no
one
could
ever
supplant
her
or
fill
the
void
in
his
life
her
death
had
made
he
told
himself
this
new
love
was
something
different
and
in
no
way
disturbed
her
memory
but
the
tomb
still
stood
in
his
way
i
am
calm
and
tranquil
he
wrote
helen
and
but
for
a
strange
shadow
of
coming
evil
which
haunts
me
i
should
be
happy
that
i
am
not
supremely
happy
even
when
i
feel
your
dear
love
at
my
heart
terrifies
me
later
he
wrote
you
say
that
all
depends
on
my
own
firmness
if
this
be
so
all
is
safe
henceforward
i
am
strong
but
all
does
not
depend
dear
helen
upon
my
firmness
all
depends
upon
the
sincerity
of
your
love
a
month
later
the
skies
of
providence
shone
brightly
upon
him
he
returned
there
was
received
by
whitman
as
her
affianced
lover
delivered
his
brilliant
lecture
upon
the
poetic
principle
to
a
great
throng
of
enthusiastic
hearers
and
won
a
promise
from
his
lady
to
marry
him
at
once
and
return
with
him
to
fordham
he
scribbled
a
line
to
mother
clemm
notifying
her
to
be
ready
to
receive
him
and
his
bride
and
went
so
far
as
to
engage
the
services
of
a
clergyman
and
to
sign
a
marriage
contract
in
which
whitman
property
was
made
over
to
her
mother
but
just
at
this
point
a
note
was
slipped
into
the
hand
of
helen
informing
her
that
her
lover
had
been
seen
drinking
wine
in
the
hotel
when
he
called
at
her
house
soon
afterward
she
received
him
surrounded
by
her
family
and
though
there
were
no
signs
of
the
wine
said
no
to
him
emphatically
for
the
first
time
he
plead
but
she
remained
firm
receiving
his
passionate
words
of
remonstrance
with
sorrowful
silence
while
her
mother
impatient
at
his
persistence
showed
him
the
door
he
prayed
that
she
would
at
least
speak
one
word
to
him
in
farewell
what
can
i
say
she
questioned
say
that
you
love
me
helen
i
love
you
with
these
words
in
his
ears
he
was
gone
as
he
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
out
of
her
life
he
saw
or
fancied
he
saw
through
the
veiled
window
a
white
figure
beckoning
to
him
but
his
steps
were
sternly
set
toward
the
opposite
direction
his
whole
being
crying
within
him
nevermore
nevermore
she
had
stretched
out
her
spiritlike
hands
but
to
draw
them
back
again
in
the
fashion
that
fascinated
and
at
the
same
time
maddened
him
once
too
often
the
wave
of
romantic
feeling
which
had
borne
him
along
since
his
vision
of
her
in
the
garden
suddenly
subsided
leaving
him
disillusioned
cold
the
reaction
was
so
violent
that
instead
of
the
magnetic
attraction
she
had
had
for
him
he
felt
himself
positively
repelled
by
the
thought
of
her
unearthly
beauty
her
mysterious
eyes
he
went
straight
to
the
depot
and
took
the
train
just
leaving
which
would
bear
him
back
to
the
cottage
among
the
cherry
trees
mother
clemm
expecting
him
to
bring
home
a
bride
had
spent
the
day
putting
an
extra
touch
of
brightness
upon
the
simple
but
already
spotless
home
a
cheerful
fire
was
in
the
grate
branches
of
holly
cedar
and
such
other
such
bits
of
beauty
as
the
woods
afforded
were
everywhere
about
the
house
and
the
mother
herself
in
the
snowiest
of
caps
with
the
sheerest
of
floating
strings
and
a
gallant
look
of
welcome
upon
her
sorrowful
face
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
for
the
coming
of
the
son
that
heaven
had
given
her
and
the
woman
who
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
daughter
that
heaven
had
taken
away
from
her
her
nature
had
quailed
at
the
thought
but
it
had
withstood
many
a
blast
it
could
weather
one
more
and
after
all
if
eddie
were
happy
in
the
far
distance
a
figure
emerged
out
of
the
gathering
dusk
a
man
could
it
be
eddie
alone
yes
it
surely
was
he
the
carriage
of
the
head
the
military
cloak
the
walk
were
unmistakable
but
he
was
alone
she
grew
weak
in
the
the
shock
of
joy
more
nearly
unnerved
her
than
had
the
pain
she
had
braced
herself
to
bear
the
pain
she
recovered
her
composure
and
hastened
to
the
door
just
in
time
to
be
folded
into
the
arms
of
the
figure
in
the
cloak
helen
she
queried
is
dead
to
me
he
answered
with
his
arms
still
about
her
we
will
have
nothing
more
to
say
of
her
except
this
muddie
i
have
been
in
a
dream
from
which
thank
god
i
am
now
awake
in
the
darkness
of
my
loneliness
of
my
misery
of
which
you
alone
have
the
slightest
conception
i
saw
a
light
which
i
fancied
would
lead
me
to
the
love
for
which
my
soul
is
starving
to
the
sympathy
which
is
sweeter
even
than
love
to
the
broken
heart
of
a
man
i
followed
it
i
was
deceived
it
was
no
real
light
but
a
mere
will
o
the
wisp
bred
in
the
dank
tarn
of
despair
he
released
her
to
hang
up
the
cloak
in
the
little
entrance
hall
then
taking
her
hand
which
he
raised
to
his
lips
drew
her
into
the
sitting
room
ah
but
it
is
good
to
be
at
home
again
he
exclaimed
his
whole
manner
changed
a
mighty
weight
seemed
to
roll
from
his
shoulders
as
he
stretched
his
legs
before
the
fire
his
old
merry
laugh
the
laugh
of
edgar
goodfellow
rang
out
as
he
told
muddie
of
the
success
of
his
lecture
in
providence
of
the
great
audience
and
the
applause
muddie
he
cried
my
dream
of
will
come
true
yet
a
few
more
such
audiences
and
the
money
will
be
in
sight
and
let
me
add
i
am
done
with
literary
women
henceforth
literature
herself
shall
be
my
sole
mistress
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
profession
of
letters
is
the
only
one
fit
for
a
man
of
brain
there
is
little
money
in
it
of
course
but
i
rather
be
a
author
earning
a
bare
living
than
a
king
beyond
a
living
what
does
a
man
of
brain
want
with
money
anyhow
muddie
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
all
that
is
really
valuable
to
a
man
of
talent
especially
to
a
poet
is
absolutely
unpurchasable
love
fame
the
dominion
of
intellect
the
consciousness
of
power
the
thrilling
sense
of
beauty
the
free
air
of
heaven
exercise
of
body
and
mind
with
the
physical
and
moral
health
that
these
bring
these
and
such
as
these
are
really
all
a
poet
cares
about
then
why
should
he
mind
what
the
world
calls
poverty
why
indeed
echoed
happy
muddie
it
was
so
delightful
to
have
her
son
back
at
home
and
in
this
hopeful
contented
frame
she
would
have
agreed
with
him
in
almost
any
statement
he
chose
to
make
he
gave
her
loving
messages
from
annie
and
told
her
in
the
bright
humorous
way
which
was
characteristic
of
edgar
goodfellow
of
many
pleasant
little
incidents
of
his
journey
one
of
the
nights
to
look
back
upon
and
to
gloat
over
in
memory
was
this
night
by
the
fireside
at
fordham
cottage
with
the
mother
a
night
of
calm
and
content
under
the
after
tempestuous
wandering
a
quiet
sweet
christmas
they
spent
together
he
reading
writing
or
talking
over
plans
for
new
work
while
she
sat
by
with
her
sewing
and
catalina
dozed
on
the
hearth
part
of
every
day
wrapped
in
the
old
cape
he
walked
in
the
pine
wood
or
beside
the
river
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
feverish
dream
of
new
love
had
come
to
him
he
was
able
to
visit
the
tomb
of
virginia
and
to
dwell
with
happiness
and
with
a
clear
conscience
upon
her
memory
during
these
days
of
serenity
a
ballad
suggested
by
thoughts
of
her
and
his
life
with
her
in
the
lovely
valley
of
the
grass
took
form
in
his
mind
it
was
no
song
of
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
but
a
song
of
a
fair
kingdom
by
the
sea
and
in
contrast
to
the
sombre
ulalume
he
gave
to
the
maiden
in
the
new
poem
the
pleasant
sounding
name
of
annabel
lee
out
of
these
days
too
came
the
bells
and
the
exquisite
sonnet
to
his
more
than
mother
one
flash
of
the
false
light
that
had
lured
him
reached
the
dreamer
at
fordham
he
held
a
letter
addressed
to
him
in
the
familiar
handwriting
of
helen
whitman
long
in
his
hand
without
opening
it
this
flame
was
burned
out
he
told
himself
why
rake
its
cold
ashes
yet
he
felt
that
nothing
that
she
could
say
would
have
power
to
disturb
his
new
peace
still
the
mother
though
she
kept
her
own
counsel
trembled
for
herself
and
for
him
as
she
was
aware
without
looking
up
from
her
sewing
that
he
had
broken
the
seal
some
minutes
of
tense
stillness
passed
then
shall
i
read
you
her
letter
he
asked
as
you
will
then
i
will
it
is
in
verse
and
the
place
from
which
she
dates
it
is
our
island
of
dreams
which
she
explains
in
a
is
by
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
faery
lands
forlorn
a
line
which
she
has
borrowed
from
keats
this
is
what
she
writes
tell
him
i
lingered
alone
on
the
shore
where
we
parted
in
sorrow
to
meet
nevermore
the
blew
cold
on
my
desolate
heart
but
colder
those
wild
words
of
doom
must
part
the
dark
heaving
waters
i
sent
forth
a
cry
save
the
wail
of
those
waters
there
came
no
reply
i
longed
like
a
bird
the
billows
to
flee
from
our
lone
island
home
and
the
moan
of
the
sea
away
far
away
from
the
wild
ocean
shore
where
the
waves
ever
murmur
more
nevermore
where
i
wake
in
the
wild
noon
of
midnight
to
hear
the
lone
song
of
the
surges
so
mournful
and
drear
where
the
clouds
that
now
veil
from
us
heaven
fair
light
their
soft
silver
lining
turn
forth
on
the
night
when
time
shall
the
vapors
of
falsehood
dispel
he
shall
know
if
i
loved
him
but
never
how
well
silence
followed
the
reading
of
the
finally
the
mother
asked
will
you
go
back
he
placed
the
letter
upon
the
top
of
a
pile
in
the
same
handwriting
tied
them
together
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
and
laid
them
in
a
small
drawer
of
his
desk
then
rising
he
leaned
over
the
back
of
muddie
chair
and
lightly
touching
her
seamed
forehead
with
his
lips
replied
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
then
took
up
a
garland
of
evergreen
which
he
had
been
making
when
the
mother
came
in
with
the
mail
and
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
churchyard
with
its
legended
tomb
chapter
xxxiii
back
in
richmond
the
richmond
he
loved
best
richmond
full
of
sunshine
and
flowers
and
the
sweet
southern
social
life
out
of
doors
in
gardens
and
porches
richmond
in
summertime
in
spite
of
the
changes
his
observant
eye
marked
as
he
rattled
over
the
cobblestones
toward
the
swan
tavern
on
broad
and
ninth
streets
he
almost
felt
that
he
was
back
in
boyhood
it
was
just
such
a
day
just
this
time
of
year
that
as
a
lad
of
eleven
he
had
seen
richmond
first
after
his
five
years
absence
in
england
how
good
it
was
to
be
back
upon
the
sacred
soil
how
sweet
the
air
was
and
how
beautiful
were
the
roses
when
before
had
he
seen
a
magnolia
tree
in
bloom
with
its
dense
shade
its
dark
green
shining
foliage
and
its
blossoms
was
there
anything
in
the
world
so
sweet
as
its
odor
combined
with
that
of
the
roses
and
the
other
flowers
that
filled
the
gardens
it
was
worth
coming
all
the
way
from
new
york
just
to
see
and
to
smell
them
he
caught
glimpses
of
one
or
two
familiar
figures
as
he
drove
along
how
impatient
he
was
to
see
his
old
friends
everybody
white
and
colored
old
and
young
masculine
and
feminine
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
to
the
tavern
remove
the
dust
of
travel
and
sally
forth
upon
the
round
of
visits
he
intended
to
make
his
spirits
went
up
and
up
and
finally
it
was
edgar
goodfellow
in
the
flesh
who
stepped
jauntily
from
the
door
of
swan
tavern
arrayed
for
calling
in
spite
of
the
summer
temperature
he
looked
the
personification
of
coolness
and
comfort
the
taste
of
prosperity
his
lectures
had
brought
him
was
evident
in
his
modest
but
spruce
apparel
he
had
discarded
the
habitual
black
cloth
for
a
coat
and
trousers
of
white
linen
exquisitely
laundered
by
mother
clemm
capable
and
loving
hands
which
he
wore
with
a
black
velvet
vest
for
which
he
had
also
to
thank
the
mother
and
her
skilled
needle
a
panama
hat
shaded
his
pale
features
and
the
grey
eyes
which
glowed
with
happiness
as
with
proudly
carried
head
and
quick
easy
gait
he
bore
westward
up
broad
street
no
single
person
passed
him
that
did
not
turn
to
look
with
admiration
upon
the
handsome
distinguished
stranger
and
to
mentally
ask
who
is
he
it
so
happened
that
jack
mackenzie
was
the
first
acquaintance
he
met
edgar
he
said
as
their
hands
joined
in
affectionate
grasp
do
you
remember
once
years
ago
i
met
you
in
the
street
and
you
said
you
were
going
to
look
for
the
end
of
the
rainbow
well
you
look
as
if
you
had
found
it
i
have
was
the
reply
an
hour
ago
it
was
here
in
richmond
all
the
time
and
i
did
know
it
and
like
a
poor
fool
have
been
wandering
the
world
over
in
a
vain
search
for
it
the
trouble
is
i
was
looking
for
the
wrong
thing
i
was
looking
for
fame
and
fortune
thought
of
which
blinded
my
eyes
to
something
far
better
scenes
and
friendships
of
jack
he
continued
as
arm
in
arm
the
two
friends
made
their
way
up
the
street
jack
life
is
a
great
schoolmaster
but
why
does
it
take
so
long
to
drub
any
sense
into
these
blockheads
of
ours
damned
if
i
know
replied
his
companion
who
was
more
truthful
always
than
either
poetic
or
philosophic
but
if
you
mean
that
you
decided
to
come
back
to
richmond
to
live
i
mighty
glad
to
hear
it
that
what
i
mean
i
came
only
for
a
visit
and
to
lecture
but
made
up
my
mind
on
the
way
from
the
depot
to
come
for
good
as
soon
as
i
can
arrange
to
do
so
i
think
it
was
a
magnolia
tree
in
bloom
the
first
i
had
seen
in
many
a
year
that
decided
me
well
all
of
your
old
friends
will
be
glad
to
have
you
back
one
in
particular
that
i
might
mention
do
you
remember
elmira
royster
she
a
comely
widow
now
with
a
comfortable
fortune
and
she
always
had
a
lingering
fondness
for
you
i
advise
you
to
hunt
her
up
the
dreamer
face
clouded
women
are
angels
jack
he
said
they
are
the
salt
that
will
save
this
world
if
it
is
to
be
saved
and
for
poor
sinners
like
me
there
would
be
simply
no
hope
in
either
this
world
or
the
next
but
for
them
but
they
will
have
no
more
part
in
my
life
save
as
friends
a
true
friend
of
mine
however
i
believe
myra
is
i
saw
her
during
my
brief
visit
here
last
ah
rob
my
boy
howdy
the
two
friends
had
turned
into
sixth
street
and
as
they
drew
near
the
corner
of
sixth
and
grace
almost
ran
into
rob
stanard
now
a
prominent
lawyer
and
one
of
the
leading
gentlemen
of
the
town
eddie
poe
as
i
alive
he
exclaimed
with
a
hearty
my
my
what
a
pleasure
i
on
my
way
home
to
dinner
boys
come
in
both
of
you
and
take
with
us
my
wife
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
the
invitation
was
accepted
as
naturally
as
it
was
given
and
the
three
mounted
together
the
steps
of
the
beautiful
house
and
were
received
in
the
charmingly
homelike
opening
from
the
wide
hall
by
rob
wife
a
kentucky
belle
who
had
stepped
gracefully
into
her
place
as
mistress
of
one
of
the
notable
homes
in
virginia
capital
as
she
gave
her
jewelled
hand
to
edgar
poe
her
handsome
black
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
she
was
not
only
sincerely
glad
to
receive
the
friend
of
her
husband
boyhood
but
keen
appreciation
of
intellectual
gifts
made
her
feel
that
to
know
him
was
a
distinction
some
of
the
servants
who
had
known
marse
eddie
in
the
old
days
were
still
of
the
household
having
come
to
robert
stanard
as
part
of
his
estate
and
they
were
to
their
intense
gratification
pleasantly
greeted
by
the
visitor
that
evening
and
many
subsequent
evenings
the
dreamer
spent
at
duncan
lodge
with
the
mackenzies
and
their
friends
a
series
of
sunlit
days
followed
days
of
lingering
in
rob
sully
studio
or
in
the
familiar
office
of
southern
literary
where
the
editor
john
thompson
himself
a
poet
gave
him
a
warm
welcome
always
and
gladly
accepted
and
published
in
anything
the
famous
former
editor
would
let
him
have
days
of
wandering
in
the
woods
or
by
the
tumbling
river
he
had
loved
as
a
lad
days
of
searching
out
old
haunts
and
making
new
ones
and
everywhere
he
found
welcome
delightful
little
parties
were
given
in
his
honor
when
in
return
for
the
courtesies
paid
him
he
charmed
the
company
by
reciting
the
raven
as
he
alone
could
recite
it
his
lectures
upon
the
poetic
principle
and
the
philosophy
of
composition
and
his
readings
in
the
assembly
rooms
of
the
exchange
hotel
drew
the
elite
of
the
city
who
sat
spellbound
while
he
erect
and
still
and
pale
as
a
statue
filled
their
ears
with
the
music
of
his
voice
and
their
souls
with
wonder
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
thought
and
words
subscriptions
to
poured
in
at
last
this
dream
of
his
life
seemed
an
assured
fact
one
door
one
only
in
all
the
town
did
not
swing
wide
to
receive
him
the
closed
portal
of
the
mansion
of
which
he
had
been
the
proud
young
master
still
said
to
him
nevermore
and
he
always
had
a
creepy
sensation
when
he
passed
it
which
even
the
sight
of
the
he
had
loved
in
fullest
bloom
did
not
overcome
the
golden
days
ran
into
golden
weeks
and
the
weeks
into
months
and
still
edgar
poe
was
making
holiday
in
richmond
the
first
holiday
he
had
had
since
as
a
youth
of
seventeen
he
had
quarrelled
with
john
allan
and
gone
forth
to
the
battle
of
life
in
the
long
long
battle
since
then
there
had
been
more
of
joy
than
they
knew
who
looking
on
had
seen
the
toil
and
the
defeat
and
the
despair
but
from
whose
eyes
the
exaltation
he
had
felt
in
the
act
of
creation
or
in
the
contemplation
of
the
works
of
nature
and
the
happiness
he
found
in
his
frugal
home
were
hidden
but
as
has
been
said
there
had
been
no
holiday
until
now
when
he
had
come
back
to
richmond
an
older
and
a
sadder
and
a
more
experienced
edgar
poe
an
edgar
poe
upon
whom
the
silence
and
the
solitude
had
fallen
and
had
left
shaken
broken
yet
that
personal
identity
upon
the
mystery
of
which
he
liked
to
ponder
the
unquenchable
immortal
was
there
and
it
was
for
all
the
outward
and
inward
changes
the
same
edgar
poe
with
his
two
natures
dreamer
and
goodfellow
alternately
dominating
him
who
had
come
back
to
find
the
real
end
of
the
rainbow
in
revisiting
old
scenes
renewing
old
friendships
awakening
old
memories
and
had
paused
to
make
holiday
even
in
these
golden
days
there
were
occasional
falls
for
the
cup
of
kindness
was
everywhere
and
in
his
blood
was
the
same
old
strain
which
made
madness
for
him
in
the
single
glass
the
single
drop
almost
and
in
spite
of
all
the
great
schoolmaster
life
had
taught
him
there
was
in
his
will
the
same
old
element
of
weakness
had
it
been
otherwise
he
had
not
been
edgar
poe
at
times
too
the
blue
devils
raised
their
heads
had
it
been
otherwise
he
had
not
been
edgar
poe
but
on
the
whole
the
holiday
was
a
bright
dream
of
paradise
regained
at
a
time
when
more
than
ever
before
his
feet
had
seemed
to
march
only
to
the
cadence
of
the
old
sad
word
nevermore
two
sacred
pilgrimages
he
made
early
in
this
holiday
to
the
two
shrines
of
his
romantic
boyhood
to
shockoe
cemetery
where
he
not
only
visited
helen
tomb
but
laid
a
wreath
upon
the
grave
of
frances
allan
his
little
foster
mother
and
to
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
the
white
steeple
still
slept
serenely
in
the
blue
atmosphere
above
the
church
and
as
of
yore
the
bell
called
in
deep
sweet
tones
to
prayer
but
how
the
churchyard
had
filled
since
he
saw
it
last
graves
graves
everywhere
it
was
appalling
he
stepped
between
the
graves
old
and
new
stooping
to
read
the
inscriptions
upon
the
slabs
so
many
that
he
remembered
as
merry
boys
and
girls
and
hale
men
and
women
still
in
their
prime
could
they
really
be
dead
gone
forever
from
the
scenes
which
had
known
them
and
of
which
they
seemed
an
integral
part
oh
mystery
of
mysteries
how
was
it
possible
yet
here
were
their
names
plainly
written
upon
the
marbles
the
church
builded
by
men
hands
the
trees
planted
by
men
hands
the
monuments
fashioned
by
men
hands
remained
but
the
living
breathing
men
where
were
they
could
it
be
that
highest
creation
was
a
more
perishable
thing
than
the
lifeless
work
of
its
own
hand
his
spirit
cried
out
within
him
against
such
a
thought
no
it
could
not
be
gone
from
earth
or
holden
from
mortal
vision
they
assuredly
were
departed
but
dead
no
finally
he
came
to
the
grave
beside
the
wall
no
marble
tomb
told
the
that
there
lay
the
body
of
elizabeth
poe
yet
what
matter
was
her
sleep
the
less
peaceful
was
her
tired
spirit
the
less
free
if
in
its
flight
it
should
visit
this
spot
where
it
had
laid
the
burden
of
the
body
down
surely
it
would
find
for
all
there
was
no
carven
stone
to
mark
it
a
most
sweet
spot
the
greenest
of
grass
and
clover
with
blossoms
white
and
red
waved
over
it
the
summer
breeze
rippling
through
them
with
pleasant
sound
and
the
tall
trees
hung
a
green
canopy
between
it
and
the
midday
sun
as
he
laid
his
offering
of
roses
among
the
clover
blooms
and
turned
to
go
away
the
bell
in
the
steeple
began
to
toll
how
the
past
came
back
he
stood
with
uncovered
and
bowed
head
and
counted
the
strokes
suddenly
there
was
a
sound
of
horses
tramping
in
the
street
below
the
wall
then
through
the
gate
and
down
the
walk
it
came
the
solemn
procession
he
waited
until
the
last
of
the
mourners
had
passed
into
the
church
then
followed
and
as
the
bell
stopped
tolling
and
the
organ
began
to
play
the
familiar
moving
chant
he
passed
in
and
took
a
seat
near
the
door
whose
funeral
service
he
was
attending
he
knew
not
but
he
was
back
in
childhood
and
it
was
beautiful
to
him
to
hear
once
more
in
this
very
church
the
words
of
spoken
music
and
the
old
familiar
hymns
he
had
heard
that
day
when
his
infant
heart
had
been
filled
with
a
beautiful
sorrow
that
was
not
pain
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
turned
to
see
the
owner
of
the
fine
tenor
voice
that
joined
in
the
singing
of
the
hymns
and
resting
for
a
moment
upon
the
dark
uplifted
eyes
of
edgar
poe
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
not
of
this
earth
as
he
left
the
church
and
churchyard
he
noted
many
changes
in
its
immediate
neighborhood
but
the
only
one
upon
which
his
eye
lingered
was
a
smug
brick
house
of
commodious
proportions
and
genteel
aspect
a
pleasant
green
yard
afforded
space
for
a
few
trees
and
flowers
a
dignified
and
prosperous
but
not
in
the
least
romantic
house
it
was
a
house
with
no
rambling
wings
giving
opportunities
for
winding
passageways
and
odd
nooks
and
corners
no
unexpected
closets
where
skeletons
might
be
in
hiding
or
dusky
stairways
to
creak
in
the
dead
of
night
or
upon
which
even
by
day
one
was
almost
certain
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
shadowy
figure
flying
before
him
as
he
groped
his
way
up
or
down
them
a
house
with
no
mysteries
just
the
house
in
which
one
might
have
expected
to
find
elmira
royster
who
as
the
widow
shelton
the
prudent
housewife
and
good
manager
of
a
prosperous
estate
was
simply
the
frank
girl
he
had
known
grown
older
he
would
call
upon
elmira
sometime
but
not
now
little
son
so
that
she
could
only
use
the
income
was
duly
signed
and
sealed
the
wedding
ring
was
bought
with
visions
of
a
new
start
in
life
of
which
there
were
many
happy
years
in
store
for
him
why
not
he
was
only
forty
the
dreamer
set
out
on
his
way
back
to
fordham
to
settle
up
his
affairs
and
bring
mother
clemm
to
richmond
to
witness
his
marriage
and
to
take
up
her
abode
with
him
and
his
bride
in
the
brick
house
on
the
hill
he
had
been
upon
a
holiday
but
he
carried
with
him
a
goodly
sum
of
money
realized
from
his
lectures
and
a
long
list
of
subscribers
to
surely
fortune
had
never
shown
him
a
more
smiling
face
baltimore
why
did
his
way
lie
through
baltimore
baltimore
with
its
memories
of
virginia
baltimore
where
he
had
come
up
out
of
the
grave
to
the
heaven
of
her
love
and
where
had
been
first
constructed
the
most
beautiful
of
all
his
dreams
the
dream
of
the
valley
of
the
grass
in
which
he
and
she
and
the
mother
had
lived
for
each
other
only
in
baltimore
again
he
found
his
way
stopped
by
the
vision
of
a
legended
tomb
it
was
paralyzing
he
could
go
no
further
upon
his
journey
but
lingered
in
baltimore
wandering
the
streets
like
one
bereft
the
words
the
prophetic
words
of
his
own
poem
to
one
in
paradise
haunted
him
a
voice
from
out
the
future
cries
on
but
the
past
dim
gulf
my
spirit
hovering
lies
mute
motionless
aghast
and
again
the
words
of
his
bridal
ballad
more
prophetic
still
would
to
god
i
could
awaken
for
i
dream
i
know
not
how
and
my
soul
is
sorely
shaken
lest
an
evil
step
be
taken
lest
the
dead
who
is
forsaken
may
not
be
happy
now
and
that
merciless
other
self
his
accusing
conscience
arose
and
with
whisper
louder
and
more
terrible
than
ever
before
upbraided
him
reminding
him
of
the
vow
he
had
made
his
wife
upon
her
bed
of
death
alas
the
vow
that
solemn
sacred
vow
how
could
he
have
so
utterly
forgotten
it
how
plainly
he
could
see
her
lying
upon
the
snowy
pillow
her
face
not
much
less
white
her
trustful
eyes
on
his
eyes
as
he
knelt
by
her
side
and
swore
that
he
would
never
bind
himself
in
marriage
to
another
invoking
from
heaven
a
terrible
curse
upon
his
soul
if
he
should
ever
prove
traitorous
to
his
oath
alas
where
had
been
his
will
that
he
had
so
soon
forgotten
his
vow
how
he
despised
himself
for
his
weakness
he
that
had
boasted
in
the
words
of
old
joseph
glanvil
until
he
had
almost
made
them
his
own
words
doth
not
yield
himself
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
will
hours
on
hours
he
wandered
the
streets
of
the
city
whose
every
paving
stone
seemed
to
speak
to
him
of
his
virginia
the
city
where
he
had
walked
with
her
where
he
had
first
spoken
of
love
to
her
and
heard
her
sweet
confession
where
in
the
holy
church
the
beautiful
words
of
the
old
old
rite
had
made
them
one
all
day
he
wandered
and
all
night
driven
cruelly
driven
by
the
upbraiding
whisper
in
his
ear
while
before
him
still
he
saw
her
white
face
with
the
soft
eyes
looking
out
it
seemed
to
him
in
reproach
finally
the
longing
which
had
come
upon
him
in
providence
the
longing
for
the
peace
of
the
grave
and
reunion
in
death
with
virginia
was
strong
upon
him
again
pressed
him
hard
mastered
him
it
was
sometime
in
the
early
morning
that
he
swallowed
the
draught
the
draught
that
would
free
his
spirit
that
would
enable
him
to
lay
down
the
burden
of
his
body
and
to
fly
from
the
steps
that
dogged
steps
from
the
voice
that
whispered
upbraidings
he
would
lay
his
body
down
by
the
side
of
her
body
in
the
legended
tomb
while
his
spirit
would
fly
to
join
her
spirit
in
that
far
aidenn
where
they
would
be
happy
together
forever
as
he
fell
asleep
he
murmured
again
quoting
himself
and
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
when
he
opened
his
wondering
eyes
upon
the
white
walls
of
the
hospital
he
was
feeble
and
weak
in
his
limbs
as
an
infant
but
his
brain
was
unclouded
gentle
hands
ministered
to
him
and
a
woman
voice
read
him
words
from
the
gospel
of
john
but
the
draught
had
done
its
work
he
lingered
some
days
and
then
on
sunday
morning
the
seventh
day
of
october
of
the
year
his
spirit
took
its
flight
his
last
words
were
a
prayer
lord
have
mercy
on
my
poor
soul
many
were
the
friends
who
rose
up
to
comfort
the
stricken
mother
and
who
hastened
to
bring
rosemary
to
the
poet
grave
but
there
was
one
whom
he
had
believed
to
be
his
friend
a
big
man
whose
big
brain
he
had
admired
in
whose
furtive
eye
was
an
unholy
glee
about
whose
thick
lips
played
a
smile
which
slightly
revealed
his
teeth
to
him
was
entrusted
the
part
of
literary
executor
it
had
been
the
dreamer
own
request
in
his
power
it
would
lie
to
give
to
the
world
his
own
account
of
this
man
who
had
said
he
was
no
poet
and
had
distanced
him
in
the
race
for
a
woman
favor
the
day
was
at
hand
when
rufus
griswold
would
have
his
full
revenge
upon
the
fair
fame
of
edgar
the
dreamer
out
out
are
the
lights
out
all
and
over
each
quivering
form
the
curtain
a
funeral
pall
comes
down
with
the
rush
of
a
storm
and
the
angels
all
pallid
and
wan
uprising
unveiling
affirm
that
the
play
is
the
tragedy
and
its
hero
the
conqueror
