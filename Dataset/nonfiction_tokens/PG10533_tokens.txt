héloïse
love
when
adam
and
eve
were
expelled
from
paradise
they
yet
found
one
flower
wherever
they
wandered
blooming
in
perpetual
beauty
this
flower
represents
a
great
certitude
without
which
few
would
be
happy
subtile
mysterious
inexplicable
a
great
boon
recognized
alike
by
poets
and
moralists
pagan
and
christian
yea
identified
not
only
with
happiness
but
human
existence
and
pertaining
to
the
soul
in
its
highest
aspirations
allied
with
the
transient
and
the
mortal
even
with
the
weak
and
corrupt
it
is
yet
immortal
in
its
nature
and
lofty
in
its
aims
at
once
a
passion
a
sentiment
and
an
inspiration
to
attempt
to
describe
woman
without
this
element
of
our
complex
nature
which
constitutes
her
peculiar
fascination
is
like
trying
to
act
the
tragedy
of
hamlet
without
hamlet
himself
an
absurdity
a
picture
without
a
central
figure
a
novel
without
a
heroine
a
religion
without
a
sacrifice
my
subject
is
not
without
its
difficulties
the
passion
or
sentiment
i
describe
is
degrading
when
perverted
as
it
is
exalting
when
pure
yet
it
is
not
vice
i
would
paint
but
virtue
not
weakness
but
strength
not
the
transient
but
the
permanent
not
the
mortal
but
the
immortal
all
that
is
ennobling
in
the
aspiring
soul
socrates
says
legouvé
who
caught
glimpses
of
everything
that
he
did
not
clearly
define
uttered
one
day
to
his
disciples
these
beautiful
words
are
two
venuses
one
celestial
called
urania
the
heavenly
who
presides
over
all
pure
and
spiritual
affections
and
the
other
polyhymnia
the
terrestrial
who
excites
sensual
and
gross
desires
the
history
of
love
is
the
eternal
struggle
between
these
two
divinities
the
one
seeking
to
elevate
and
the
other
to
degrade
plato
for
the
first
time
in
his
beautiful
hymn
to
the
venus
urania
displayed
to
men
the
unknown
image
of
love
the
educator
and
the
moralist
so
that
grateful
ages
have
consecrated
it
by
his
name
centuries
rolled
away
and
among
the
descendants
of
teutonic
barbarians
a
still
lovelier
and
more
ideal
sentiment
burst
out
from
the
lips
of
the
christian
dante
kindled
by
the
adoration
of
his
departed
beatrice
and
as
she
courses
from
star
to
star
explaining
to
him
the
mysteries
the
transported
poet
exclaims
ah
all
the
tongues
which
the
muses
have
inspired
could
not
tell
the
thousandth
part
of
the
beauty
of
the
smile
of
beatrice
as
she
presented
me
to
the
celestial
group
exclaiming
art
redeemed
o
woman
in
whom
lives
all
my
hope
who
hast
deigned
to
leave
for
my
salvation
thy
footsteps
on
the
throne
of
the
eternal
thou
hast
redeemed
me
from
slavery
to
liberty
now
earth
has
no
more
dangers
for
me
i
cherish
the
image
of
thy
purity
in
my
bosom
that
in
my
last
hour
acceptable
in
thine
eyes
my
soul
may
leave
my
body
thus
did
dante
impersonate
the
worship
of
venus
urania
spiritual
tenderness
overcoming
sensual
desire
thus
faithful
to
the
traditions
of
this
great
poet
did
the
austere
michael
angelo
do
reverence
to
the
virtues
of
vittoria
colonna
thus
did
the
lofty
corneille
present
in
his
pauline
a
divine
model
of
the
love
which
inspires
great
deeds
and
accompanies
great
virtues
thus
did
shakspeare
in
his
portrait
of
portia
show
the
blended
generosity
and
simplicity
of
a
woman
soul
for
you
my
lord
bassanio
i
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
a
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
or
in
his
still
more
beautiful
delineation
of
juliet
paint
an
absorbing
devotion
my
bounty
is
as
boundless
as
the
sea
my
love
as
deep
the
more
i
give
to
thee
the
more
i
have
for
both
are
infinite
thus
did
milton
in
his
transcendent
epic
show
how
a
paradise
was
regained
when
woman
gave
her
generous
sympathy
to
man
and
reproduced
for
all
coming
ages
the
image
of
spiritual
love
the
inamorata
of
dante
and
petrarch
the
inspired
and
consoling
guide
but
the
muse
of
the
poets
even
when
sanctified
by
christianity
never
sang
such
an
immortal
love
as
the
middle
ages
in
sober
prose
have
handed
down
in
the
history
of
héloïse
the
struggle
between
the
two
venuses
of
socrates
and
the
final
victory
of
urania
though
not
till
after
the
temporary
triumph
of
polyhymnia
the
inamorata
of
earth
clad
in
the
vestments
of
a
sanctified
recluse
and
purified
by
the
chastisements
of
heaven
saint
theresa
dies
longing
to
join
her
divine
spouse
but
saint
theresa
is
only
a
héloïse
looking
towards
heaven
héloïse
has
an
earthly
idol
but
her
devotion
has
in
it
all
the
elements
of
a
supernatural
fervor
the
crucifixion
of
self
in
the
glory
of
him
she
adored
he
was
not
worthy
of
her
idolatry
but
she
thought
that
he
was
admiration
for
genius
exalted
sentiment
into
adoration
and
imagination
invested
the
object
of
love
with
qualities
superhuman
nations
do
not
spontaneously
keep
alive
the
memory
of
those
who
have
disgraced
them
it
is
their
heroes
and
heroines
whose
praises
they
sing
those
only
who
have
shone
in
the
radiance
of
genius
and
virtue
they
forget
defects
if
these
are
counterbalanced
by
grand
services
or
great
deeds
if
their
sons
and
daughters
have
shed
lustre
on
the
land
which
gave
them
birth
but
no
lustre
survives
egotism
or
vice
it
only
lasts
when
it
gilds
a
noble
life
there
is
no
glory
in
the
name
of
jezebel
or
cleopatra
or
catherine
de
medici
brilliant
and
fascinating
as
were
those
queens
but
there
is
glory
in
the
memory
of
héloïse
there
is
no
woman
in
french
history
of
whom
the
nation
is
prouder
revered
in
spite
of
early
follies
by
the
most
austere
and
venerated
saints
of
her
beclouded
age
and
hallowed
by
the
tributes
of
succeeding
centuries
for
those
sentiments
which
the
fires
of
passion
were
scarcely
able
to
tarnish
for
an
exalted
soul
which
eclipsed
the
brightness
of
uncommon
intellectual
faculties
for
a
depth
of
sympathy
and
affection
which
have
become
embalmed
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
for
a
living
piety
which
blazes
all
the
more
conspicuously
from
the
sins
which
she
expiated
by
such
bitter
combats
she
was
human
in
her
impulses
but
divine
in
her
graces
one
of
those
characters
for
whom
we
can
not
help
feeling
the
deepest
sympathy
and
the
profoundest
admiration
a
character
that
has
its
contradictions
like
that
who
was
after
god
own
heart
in
spite
of
his
crimes
because
his
soul
thirsted
for
the
beatitudes
of
heaven
and
was
bound
in
loving
loyalty
to
his
maker
against
whom
he
occasionally
sinned
by
force
of
mortal
passions
but
whom
he
never
ignored
or
forgot
and
against
whom
he
never
persistently
rebelled
as
a
but
religious
age
produced
a
david
with
his
strikingly
double
nature
perpetually
at
war
with
itself
and
looking
for
aid
to
god
his
sun
his
shield
his
hope
and
joy
so
an
equally
unenlightened
but
devout
age
produced
a
héloïse
the
impersonation
of
sympathy
disinterestedness
suffering
forgiveness
and
resignation
i
have
already
described
this
dark
sad
turbulent
superstitious
ignorant
period
of
strife
and
suffering
yet
not
without
its
poetic
charms
and
religious
aspirations
when
the
convent
and
the
castle
were
its
chief
external
features
and
when
a
life
of
meditation
was
as
marked
as
a
life
of
bodily
activity
as
if
old
age
and
youth
were
battling
for
supremacy
a
very
peculiar
state
of
society
in
which
we
see
the
loftiest
speculations
of
the
intellect
and
the
highest
triumphs
of
faith
blended
with
puerile
enterprises
and
misdirected
physical
forces
in
this
age
héloïse
was
born
about
the
year
nobody
knew
who
was
her
father
although
it
was
surmised
that
he
belonged
to
the
illustrious
family
of
the
montmorencies
which
traced
an
unbroken
lineage
to
pharimond
before
the
time
of
clovis
she
lived
with
her
uncle
fulbert
an
ignorant
old
canon
of
the
cathedral
church
of
notre
dame
in
paris
he
called
her
his
niece
but
whether
niece
or
daughter
or
adopted
child
was
a
mystery
she
was
of
extraordinary
beauty
though
remarkable
for
expression
rather
than
for
regularity
of
feature
in
intellect
she
was
precocious
and
brilliant
but
the
qualities
of
a
great
soul
shone
above
the
radiance
of
her
wit
she
was
bright
amiable
affectionate
and
sympathetic
the
type
of
an
interesting
woman
the
ecclesiastic
was
justly
proud
of
her
and
gave
to
her
all
the
education
the
age
afforded
although
not
meaning
to
be
a
nun
she
was
educated
in
a
neighboring
convent
for
convents
even
in
those
times
were
female
seminaries
containing
many
inmates
who
never
intended
to
take
the
veil
but
the
convent
then
as
since
was
a
living
grave
to
all
who
took
its
vows
and
was
hated
by
brilliant
women
who
were
not
religious
the
convent
necessarily
and
logically
according
to
the
theology
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
retreat
from
the
world
a
cell
of
expiation
and
yet
it
was
the
only
place
where
a
woman
could
be
educated
héloïse
it
would
seem
made
extraordinary
attainments
and
spoke
latin
as
well
as
her
native
tongue
she
won
universal
admiration
and
in
due
time
at
the
age
of
eighteen
returned
to
her
uncle
house
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
on
the
island
called
the
cité
where
the
majestic
cathedral
and
the
castle
of
the
king
towered
above
the
rude
houses
of
the
people
adjoining
the
church
were
the
cloisters
of
the
monks
and
the
episcopal
school
the
infant
university
of
paris
over
which
the
archdeacon
of
paris
william
of
champeaux
presided
in
scholastic
dignity
and
pride
next
to
the
bishop
the
most
influential
man
in
paris
the
teachers
of
this
school
or
masters
and
doctors
as
they
were
called
and
the
priests
of
the
cathedral
formed
the
intellectual
aristocracy
of
the
city
and
they
were
frequent
visitors
at
the
house
of
fulbert
the
canon
his
niece
as
she
was
presumed
to
be
was
the
great
object
of
attraction
there
never
was
a
time
when
intellectual
frenchmen
have
not
bowed
down
to
cultivated
women
héloïse
though
only
a
girl
was
a
queen
of
such
society
as
existed
in
the
city
albeit
more
admired
by
men
than
women
poetical
imaginative
witty
ready
frank
with
a
singular
appreciation
of
intellectual
excellence
dazzled
by
literary
fame
and
looking
up
to
those
brilliant
men
who
worshipped
her
in
truth
héloïse
was
a
prodigy
she
was
vastly
superior
to
the
men
who
surrounded
her
most
of
whom
were
pedants
or
sophists
or
bigots
dignitaries
indeed
but
men
who
exalted
the
accidental
and
the
external
over
the
real
and
the
permanent
men
who
were
fond
of
quibbles
and
sophistries
jealous
of
each
other
and
of
their
own
reputation
dogmatic
and
positive
as
priests
are
apt
to
be
and
most
positive
on
points
which
either
are
of
no
consequence
or
can
not
be
solved
the
soul
of
héloïse
panted
for
a
greater
intellectual
freedom
and
a
deeper
sympathy
than
these
priests
could
give
she
pined
in
society
she
was
isolated
by
her
own
superiority
superior
not
merely
in
the
radiance
of
the
soul
but
in
the
treasures
of
the
mind
nor
could
her
companions
comprehend
her
greatness
even
while
they
were
fascinated
by
her
presence
she
dazzled
them
by
her
personal
beauty
perhaps
more
than
by
her
wit
for
even
mediaeval
priests
could
admire
an
expansive
brow
a
deep
blue
eye
et
penétrant
a
mouth
varying
with
unconscious
sarcasms
teeth
strong
and
regular
a
neck
long
and
flexible
and
shoulders
sloping
and
gracefully
moulded
over
which
fell
ample
and
golden
locks
while
the
attitude
the
complexion
the
blush
the
thrilling
accent
and
the
gracious
smile
languor
and
passion
depicted
on
a
face
both
pale
and
animated
seduced
the
imagination
and
commanded
homage
venus
polyhymnia
stood
confessed
in
all
her
charms
for
the
time
triumphant
over
that
venus
urania
who
made
the
convent
of
the
paraclete
in
after
times
a
blessed
comforter
to
all
who
sought
its
consolations
among
the
distinguished
visitors
at
the
house
of
her
uncle
the
canon
attracted
by
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
was
a
man
years
of
age
of
noble
birth
but
by
profession
an
ecclesiastic
whose
large
forehead
fiery
eye
proud
air
plain
negligent
dress
and
aristocratic
manners
by
turns
affable
and
haughty
stamped
him
as
an
extraordinary
man
the
people
in
the
streets
stopped
to
gaze
at
him
as
he
passed
or
rushed
to
the
doors
and
windows
for
a
glimpse
for
he
was
as
famous
for
genius
and
learning
as
he
was
distinguished
by
manners
and
aspect
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
breton
nobleman
who
had
abandoned
his
inheritance
and
birthright
for
the
fascinations
of
literature
and
philosophy
his
name
was
peter
abélard
on
the
whole
the
most
brilliant
and
interesting
man
whom
the
middle
ages
produced
not
so
profound
as
anselm
or
learned
as
peter
lombard
or
logical
as
thomas
aquinas
or
acute
as
albertus
magnus
but
the
most
eloquent
expounder
of
philosophy
of
whom
i
have
read
he
made
the
dullest
subjects
interesting
he
clothed
the
dry
bones
of
metaphysics
with
flesh
and
blood
he
invested
the
most
abstruse
speculations
with
life
and
charm
he
filled
the
minds
of
old
men
with
envy
and
of
young
men
with
admiration
he
thrilled
admirers
with
his
wit
sarcasm
and
ridicule
a
sort
of
galileo
mocking
yet
amusing
with
a
superlative
contempt
of
dulness
and
pretension
he
early
devoted
himself
to
dialectics
to
all
the
arts
of
intellectual
gladiatorship
to
all
the
sports
of
logical
tournaments
which
were
held
in
such
value
by
the
awakened
spirits
of
the
new
civilization
such
was
abélard
precocious
ability
even
as
a
youth
that
no
champion
could
be
found
to
refute
him
in
the
whole
of
brittany
he
went
from
castle
to
castle
and
convent
to
convent
a
philosophical
seeking
intellectual
adventures
more
intent
however
on
and
conquest
than
on
the
establishment
of
the
dogmas
which
had
ruled
the
church
since
saint
augustine
he
was
a
born
logician
as
bossuet
was
a
born
priest
loving
to
dispute
as
much
as
the
bishop
of
meaux
loved
to
preach
not
a
serious
man
but
a
bright
man
ready
keen
acute
turning
fools
into
ridicule
and
pushing
acknowledged
doctrines
into
absurdity
not
to
bring
out
the
truth
as
socrates
did
or
furnish
a
sure
foundation
of
knowledge
but
to
revolutionize
and
overturn
his
spirit
was
like
that
of
lucien
desiring
to
demolish
without
substituting
anything
for
the
dogmas
he
had
made
ridiculous
consequently
he
was
mistrusted
by
the
old
oracles
of
the
schools
and
detested
by
conservative
churchmen
who
had
intellect
enough
to
see
the
tendency
of
his
speculations
in
proportion
to
the
hatred
of
orthodox
ecclesiastics
like
anselme
of
laon
and
saint
bernard
was
the
admiration
of
young
men
and
of
the
infant
universities
nothing
embarrassed
him
he
sought
a
reason
for
all
things
he
appealed
to
reason
rather
than
authority
yet
made
the
common
mistake
of
the
scholastics
in
supposing
that
metaphysics
could
explain
everything
he
doubtless
kindled
a
spirit
of
inquiry
while
he
sapped
the
foundation
of
christianity
and
undermined
faith
he
was
a
nominalist
that
is
he
denied
the
existence
of
all
eternal
ideas
such
as
plato
and
the
early
fathers
advocated
he
is
said
to
have
even
adduced
the
opinions
of
pagan
philosophers
to
prove
the
mysteries
of
revelation
he
did
not
deny
revelation
nor
authority
nor
the
prevailing
doctrines
which
the
church
indorsed
and
defended
but
the
tendency
of
his
teachings
was
to
undermine
what
had
previously
been
received
by
faith
he
exalted
reason
therefore
as
higher
than
faith
his
spirit
was
offensive
to
conservative
teachers
had
he
lived
in
our
times
he
would
have
belonged
to
the
most
progressive
schools
of
thought
and
inquiry
probably
a
rationalist
denying
what
he
could
not
prove
by
reason
and
scorning
all
supernaturalism
a
philosopher
of
the
school
of
hume
or
strauss
or
renan
and
yet
after
assailing
everything
venerable
and
turning
his
old
teachers
into
ridicule
and
creating
a
spirit
of
rationalistic
inquiry
among
the
young
students
of
divinity
who
adored
him
abélard
settled
back
on
authority
in
his
old
age
perhaps
alarmed
and
shocked
at
the
mischief
he
had
done
in
his
more
brilliant
years
this
exceedingly
interesting
man
with
all
his
vanity
conceit
and
arrogance
had
turned
his
steps
to
paris
the
centre
of
all
intellectual
life
in
france
after
he
had
achieved
a
great
provincial
reputation
he
was
then
only
twenty
a
bright
and
daring
youth
conscious
of
his
powers
and
burning
with
ambition
he
was
not
ambitious
of
ecclesiastical
preferment
for
aristocratic
dunces
occupied
the
great
sees
and
ruled
the
great
monasteries
he
was
simply
ambitious
of
influence
over
students
in
philosophy
and
religion
fond
of
and
fame
as
a
teacher
the
universities
were
not
then
established
there
were
no
chairs
for
professors
nor
even
were
there
scholastic
titles
like
those
of
doctor
and
master
but
paris
was
full
of
students
disgusted
with
the
provincial
schools
the
cathedral
school
of
paris
was
the
great
attraction
to
these
young
men
then
presided
over
by
william
of
champeaux
a
very
respectable
theologian
but
not
a
remarkable
genius
like
aquinas
and
bonaventura
who
did
not
arise
until
the
dominican
and
franciscan
orders
were
established
to
combat
heresy
abélard
being
still
a
youth
attended
the
lectures
of
this
old
theologian
who
was
a
realist
not
an
original
thinker
but
enjoying
a
great
reputation
which
he
was
most
anxious
to
preserve
the
youthful
prodigy
at
first
was
greatly
admired
by
the
veteran
teacher
but
abélard
soon
began
to
question
him
and
argue
with
him
admiration
was
then
succeeded
by
jealousy
some
sided
with
the
venerable
teacher
but
more
with
the
flippant
yet
brilliant
youth
who
turned
his
master
teachings
into
ridicule
and
aspired
to
be
a
teacher
himself
but
as
teaching
was
under
the
supervision
of
the
school
of
notre
dame
paris
was
interdicted
to
him
he
was
not
allowed
to
combat
the
received
doctrines
which
were
taught
in
the
cathedral
school
so
he
retired
to
melun
about
thirty
miles
from
paris
and
set
up
for
a
teacher
and
lecturer
on
philosophy
all
the
influence
of
william
of
champeaux
and
his
friends
was
exerted
to
prevent
abélard
from
teaching
but
in
vain
his
was
crowded
the
most
astonishing
success
attended
his
lectures
not
contented
with
the
he
received
he
now
meditated
the
discomfiture
of
his
old
master
he
removed
still
nearer
to
paris
and
so
great
was
his
success
and
fame
that
it
is
said
he
compelled
william
to
renounce
his
realism
and
also
his
chair
and
accept
a
distant
bishopric
william
was
conquered
by
a
mere
stripling
but
that
stripling
could
have
overthrown
a
goliath
of
controversy
not
with
a
sling
but
with
a
giant
sword
abélard
having
won
a
great
dialectical
victory
which
brought
as
much
fame
as
military
laurels
on
the
battlefield
established
himself
at
geneviève
just
outside
the
walls
of
paris
where
the
pantheon
now
stands
which
is
still
the
centre
of
the
latin
quarter
and
the
residence
of
students
he
now
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
divinity
and
attended
the
lectures
of
anselm
of
laon
this
celebrated
ecclesiastic
though
not
so
famous
or
able
as
anselm
of
canterbury
was
treated
by
abélard
with
the
same
arrogance
and
flippancy
as
he
had
bestowed
on
william
of
champeaux
i
frequented
said
the
young
mocker
the
old
man
school
but
soon
discovered
that
all
his
power
was
in
length
of
practice
you
would
have
thought
he
was
kindling
a
fire
when
instantly
the
whole
house
was
filled
with
smoke
in
which
not
a
single
spark
was
visible
he
was
a
tree
covered
with
thick
foliage
which
to
the
distant
eye
had
charms
but
on
near
inspection
there
was
no
fruit
to
be
found
a
such
as
our
lord
did
curse
an
oak
such
as
lucan
compared
pompey
to
magni
nominis
what
a
comment
on
the
very
philosophy
which
abélard
himself
taught
what
better
description
of
the
scholasticism
of
the
middle
ages
but
original
and
brilliant
as
was
the
genius
of
abélard
he
no
more
could
have
anticipated
the
new
method
which
bacon
taught
than
could
thomas
aquinas
all
the
various
schools
of
the
mediaeval
dialecticians
realists
and
nominalists
alike
sought
to
establish
old
theories
not
to
discover
new
truth
they
could
not
go
beyond
their
assumptions
so
far
as
their
assumptions
were
true
they
rendered
great
service
by
their
inexorable
logic
in
defending
them
they
did
not
establish
premises
that
was
not
their
concern
or
mission
assuming
that
the
sun
revolved
around
the
earth
all
their
astronomical
speculations
were
worthless
even
as
the
assumption
of
the
old
doctrine
of
atoms
in
our
times
has
led
scientists
to
the
wildest
conclusions
the
metaphysics
of
the
schoolmen
whether
they
were
sceptical
or
reverential
simply
sharpened
the
intellectual
faculties
without
advancing
knowledge
abélard
belonged
by
nature
to
the
sceptical
school
he
delighted
in
negations
and
in
the
work
of
demolition
so
far
as
he
demolished
or
ridiculed
error
he
rendered
the
same
service
as
voltaire
did
he
prepared
the
way
for
a
more
inquiring
spirit
he
was
also
more
liberal
than
his
opponents
his
spirit
was
progressive
but
his
method
was
faulty
like
all
those
who
have
sought
to
undermine
the
old
systems
of
thought
he
was
naturally
vain
and
conceited
he
supposed
he
had
accomplished
more
than
he
really
had
he
became
bold
in
his
speculations
and
undertook
to
explain
subjects
beyond
his
grasp
thus
he
professed
to
unfold
the
meaning
of
the
prophecies
of
ezekiel
he
was
arrogant
in
his
claims
to
genius
it
is
not
by
long
study
said
he
that
i
have
mastered
the
heights
of
science
but
by
the
force
of
my
mind
this
flippancy
accompanied
by
wit
and
eloquence
fascinated
young
men
his
auditors
were
charmed
the
first
philosopher
they
said
had
become
the
first
divine
new
pupils
crowded
his
and
he
united
lectures
on
philosophy
with
lectures
on
divinity
theology
and
philosophy
encircled
his
brow
with
a
double
garland
so
popular
was
he
that
students
came
from
germany
and
italy
and
england
to
hear
his
lectures
the
number
of
his
pupils
it
is
said
was
more
than
five
thousand
and
these
included
the
brightest
intellects
of
the
age
among
whom
one
was
destined
to
be
a
pope
the
great
innocent
iii
nineteen
to
be
cardinals
and
one
hundred
to
be
bishops
what
a
proud
position
for
a
young
man
what
an
astonishing
success
for
that
age
and
his
pupils
were
as
generous
as
they
were
enthusiastic
they
filled
his
pockets
with
gold
they
hung
upon
his
lips
with
rapture
they
extolled
his
genius
wherever
they
went
they
carried
his
picture
from
court
to
court
from
castle
to
castle
and
convent
to
convent
they
begged
for
a
lock
of
his
hair
for
a
shred
of
his
garment
never
was
seen
before
such
idolatry
of
genius
such
unbounded
admiration
for
eloquence
for
he
stood
apart
and
different
from
all
other
lights
as
a
teacher
of
philosophy
he
reigned
says
lamartine
by
eloquence
over
the
spirit
of
youth
by
beauty
over
the
regard
of
women
by
which
penetrated
all
hearts
by
musical
melodies
repeated
by
every
mouth
let
us
imagine
in
a
single
man
the
first
orator
the
first
philosopher
the
first
poet
the
first
musician
of
the
age
cicero
plato
petrarch
schubert
all
united
in
one
living
celebrity
and
we
can
form
some
idea
of
his
attractions
and
fame
at
this
period
of
his
life
such
was
that
brilliant
but
unsound
man
with
learning
fame
personal
beauty
fascinating
eloquence
dialectical
acumen
aristocratic
manners
and
transcendent
wit
who
encountered
at
the
most
beautiful
gracious
accomplished
generous
and
ardent
woman
that
adorned
that
time
only
eighteen
thirsting
for
knowledge
craving
for
sympathy
and
intensely
idolatrous
of
intellectual
excellence
but
one
result
could
be
anticipated
from
such
a
meeting
they
became
passionately
enamored
of
each
other
in
order
to
secure
a
more
uninterrupted
intercourse
abélard
sought
and
obtained
a
residence
in
the
house
of
fulbert
under
pretence
of
desiring
to
superintend
the
education
of
his
niece
the
ambitious
vain
unsuspecting
priest
was
delighted
to
receive
so
great
a
man
whose
fame
filled
the
world
he
intrusted
héloïse
to
his
care
with
permission
to
use
blows
if
they
were
necessary
to
make
her
diligent
and
obedient
and
what
young
woman
with
such
a
nature
and
under
such
circumstances
could
resist
the
influence
of
such
a
teacher
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
familiar
story
how
mutual
admiration
was
followed
by
mutual
friendship
and
friendship
was
succeeded
by
mutual
infatuation
and
the
gradual
abandonment
of
both
to
a
mad
passion
forgetful
alike
of
fame
and
duty
it
became
tedious
said
abélard
to
go
to
my
lessons
i
gave
my
lectures
with
negligence
i
spoke
only
from
habit
and
memory
i
was
only
a
reciter
of
ancient
inventions
and
if
i
chanced
to
compose
verses
they
were
songs
of
love
not
secrets
of
philosophy
the
absence
of
his
mind
evinced
how
powerfully
his
new
passion
moved
his
fiery
and
impatient
soul
he
consumed
his
time
in
writing
verses
to
the
niece
and
even
as
hercules
in
the
gay
court
of
omphale
threw
down
his
club
in
order
to
hold
the
distaff
so
abélard
laid
aside
his
sceptre
as
a
monarch
of
the
schools
to
sing
sonnets
at
the
feet
of
héloïse
and
she
also
still
more
unwisely
in
the
mighty
potency
of
an
absorbing
love
yielded
up
her
honor
and
her
pride
this
mutual
infatuation
was
it
would
seem
a
gradual
transition
from
the
innocent
pleasure
of
delightful
companionship
to
the
guilt
of
unrestrained
desire
it
was
not
premeditated
design
not
calculation
but
insidious
dalliance
thou
how
guiltless
first
i
met
thy
flame
when
love
approached
me
under
friendship
name
guiltless
i
gazed
heaven
listened
when
you
sung
and
truths
divine
came
mended
from
your
tongue
from
lips
like
those
what
precept
failed
to
move
too
soon
they
taught
me
was
no
sin
to
love
in
a
healthy
state
of
society
this
mutual
passion
would
have
been
followed
by
the
marriage
ties
the
parties
were
equal
in
culture
and
social
position
and
abélard
probably
enjoyed
a
large
income
from
the
fees
of
students
and
could
well
support
the
expenses
of
a
family
all
that
was
needed
was
the
consecration
of
emotions
which
are
natural
and
irresistible
a
mystery
perhaps
but
ordained
and
without
which
marriage
would
be
mere
calculation
and
negotiation
passion
doubtless
is
blind
but
in
this
very
blindness
we
see
the
hand
of
the
creator
to
baffle
selfishness
and
pride
what
would
become
of
our
world
if
men
and
women
were
left
to
choose
their
partners
with
the
eye
of
unclouded
reason
expediency
would
soon
make
a
desert
of
earth
and
there
would
be
no
paradise
found
for
those
who
are
unattractive
or
in
adverse
circumstances
friendship
might
possibly
bring
people
together
but
friendship
exists
only
between
equals
and
people
of
congenial
tastes
love
brings
together
also
those
who
are
unequal
it
joins
the
rich
to
the
poor
the
strong
to
the
weak
the
fortunate
to
the
unfortunate
and
thus
defeats
the
calculations
which
otherwise
would
enter
into
matrimonial
life
without
the
blindness
of
passionate
love
the
darts
of
cupid
would
be
sent
in
vain
and
the
helpless
and
neglected
as
so
many
are
would
stand
but
little
chance
for
that
happiness
which
is
associated
with
the
institution
of
marriage
the
world
would
be
filled
with
old
bachelors
and
old
maids
and
population
would
hopelessly
decline
among
virtuous
people
no
scandal
would
have
resulted
from
the
ardent
loves
of
abélard
and
héloïse
had
they
been
united
by
that
sacred
relation
which
was
ordained
in
the
garden
of
eden
if
any
woman
says
legouvé
may
stand
as
the
model
of
a
wife
in
all
her
glory
it
is
héloïse
passion
without
bounds
and
without
alloy
enthusiasm
for
the
genius
of
abélard
jealous
care
for
his
reputation
a
vigorous
intellect
learning
sufficient
to
join
in
his
labors
and
an
unsullied
name
but
those
false
sophistical
ideas
which
early
entered
into
monastic
life
and
which
perverted
the
christianity
of
the
middle
ages
presented
a
powerful
barrier
against
the
instincts
of
nature
and
the
ordinances
of
god
celibacy
was
accounted
as
a
supernal
virtue
and
the
marriage
of
a
priest
was
deemed
a
lasting
disgrace
it
obscured
his
fame
his
prospects
his
position
and
his
influence
it
consigned
him
to
ridicule
and
reproach
he
was
supposed
to
be
married
only
to
the
church
and
would
be
unfaithful
to
heaven
if
he
bound
himself
by
connubial
ties
says
saint
jerome
take
axe
in
hand
and
hew
up
by
the
roots
the
sterile
tree
of
marriage
god
permits
it
i
grant
but
christ
and
mary
consecrated
virginity
alas
what
could
be
hoped
when
the
church
endorsed
such
absurd
doctrines
hildebrand
when
he
denounced
the
marriage
of
priests
made
war
on
the
most
sacred
instincts
of
human
nature
he
may
have
strengthened
the
papal
domination
but
he
weakened
the
restraints
of
home
only
a
dark
and
beclouded
age
could
have
upheld
such
a
policy
upon
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
we
lay
the
blame
of
these
false
ideas
she
is
in
a
measure
responsible
for
the
follies
of
abélard
and
héloïse
they
were
not
greater
than
the
ideas
of
their
age
had
abélard
been
as
bold
in
denouncing
the
stupid
custom
of
the
church
in
this
respect
as
he
was
in
fighting
the
monks
of
denis
or
the
intellectual
intolerance
of
bernard
he
would
not
have
fallen
in
the
respect
of
good
people
but
he
was
a
slave
to
interest
and
conventionality
he
could
not
brave
the
sneers
of
priests
or
the
opinions
of
society
he
dared
not
lose
caste
with
those
who
ruled
the
church
he
would
not
give
up
his
chances
of
preferment
he
was
unwilling
either
to
renounce
his
love
or
to
avow
it
by
an
honorable
open
union
at
last
his
intimacy
created
scandal
in
the
eyes
of
the
schools
and
of
the
church
he
had
sacrificed
philosophy
and
fame
to
a
second
delilah
and
héloïse
was
even
more
affected
by
his
humiliation
than
himself
she
more
than
he
was
opposed
to
marriage
knowing
that
this
would
doom
him
to
neglect
and
reproach
abélard
would
perhaps
have
consented
to
an
open
marriage
had
héloïse
been
willing
but
with
a
strange
perversity
she
refused
his
reputation
and
interests
were
dearer
to
her
than
was
her
own
fair
name
she
sacrificed
herself
to
his
fame
she
blinded
herself
to
the
greatest
mistake
a
woman
could
make
the
excess
of
her
love
made
her
insensible
to
the
principles
of
an
immutable
morality
circumstances
palliated
her
course
but
did
not
excuse
it
the
fatal
consequences
of
her
folly
pursued
her
into
the
immensity
of
subsequent
grief
and
though
afterwards
she
was
assured
of
peace
and
forgiveness
in
the
depths
of
her
repentance
the
demon
of
infatuated
love
was
not
easily
exorcised
she
may
have
been
unconscious
of
degradation
in
the
boundless
spirit
of
which
she
was
willing
to
make
for
the
object
of
her
devotion
but
she
lost
both
dignity
and
fame
she
entreated
him
who
was
now
quoted
as
a
reproach
to
human
weakness
since
the
languor
of
passion
had
weakened
his
power
and
his
eloquence
to
sacrifice
her
to
his
fame
to
permit
her
no
longer
to
adore
him
as
a
divinity
who
accepts
the
homage
of
his
worshippers
to
love
her
no
longer
if
this
love
diminished
his
reputation
to
reduce
her
even
if
necessary
to
the
condition
of
a
woman
despised
by
the
world
since
the
glory
of
his
love
would
more
than
compensate
for
the
contempt
of
the
universe
what
reproaches
said
she
should
i
merit
from
the
church
and
the
schools
of
philosophy
were
i
to
draw
from
them
their
brightest
star
and
shall
a
woman
dare
to
take
to
herself
that
man
whom
nature
meant
to
be
the
ornament
and
benefactor
of
the
human
race
then
reflect
on
the
nature
of
matrimony
with
its
littleness
and
cares
how
inconsistent
it
is
with
the
dignity
of
a
wise
man
saint
paul
earnestly
dissuades
from
it
so
do
the
saints
so
do
the
philosophers
of
ancient
times
think
a
while
what
a
ridiculous
association
the
philosopher
and
the
chambermaids
and
cradles
books
and
distaffs
pens
and
spindles
intent
on
speculation
when
the
truths
of
nature
and
revelation
are
breaking
on
your
eye
will
you
hear
the
sudden
cry
of
children
the
lullaby
of
nurses
the
turbulent
bustling
of
disorderly
servants
in
the
serious
pursuits
of
wisdom
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
believe
me
as
well
withdraw
totally
from
literature
as
attempt
to
proceed
in
the
midst
of
worldly
avocations
science
admits
no
participation
in
the
cares
of
life
remember
the
feats
of
xanthippe
take
counsel
from
the
example
of
socrates
who
has
been
set
up
as
a
beacon
for
all
coming
time
to
warn
philosophers
from
the
fatal
rock
of
matrimony
such
was
the
blended
truth
irony
and
wit
with
which
héloïse
dissuaded
abélard
from
open
marriage
he
compromised
the
affair
and
contented
himself
with
a
secret
marriage
after
a
night
spent
in
prayer
said
he
in
one
of
the
churches
of
paris
on
the
following
morning
we
received
the
nuptial
blessing
in
the
presence
of
the
uncle
of
héloïse
and
of
a
few
mutual
friends
we
then
retired
without
observation
that
this
union
known
only
to
god
and
a
few
intimates
should
bring
neither
shame
nor
prejudice
to
my
renown
a
cold
and
selfish
act
such
as
we
might
expect
in
louis
xiv
and
madame
de
maintenon
yet
nevertheless
the
feeble
concession
which
pride
and
policy
make
to
virtue
the
triumph
of
expediency
over
all
heroic
and
manly
qualities
like
maintenon
héloïse
was
willing
to
seem
what
she
was
not
only
to
be
explained
on
the
ground
that
concubinage
was
a
less
evil
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
than
marriage
in
a
priest
but
even
a
secret
marriage
was
attended
with
great
embarrassment
the
news
of
it
leaks
out
through
the
servants
the
envious
detractors
of
abélard
rejoice
in
his
weakness
and
his
humiliation
his
pride
now
takes
offence
and
he
denies
the
ties
and
so
does
héloïse
the
old
uncle
is
enraged
and
indignant
abélard
justly
fearing
his
resentment
yea
being
cruelly
maltreated
at
his
instigation
removes
his
wife
to
the
convent
where
she
was
educated
and
induces
her
to
take
the
veil
she
obeys
him
she
obeys
him
in
all
things
she
has
no
will
but
his
she
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
reputation
and
interest
she
forgets
herself
entirely
yet
not
without
bitter
anguish
she
accepts
the
sacrifice
but
it
costs
her
infinite
pangs
she
is
separated
from
her
husband
forever
nor
was
the
convent
agreeable
to
her
it
was
dull
monotonous
dismal
imprisonment
in
a
tomb
a
living
death
where
none
could
know
her
agonies
but
god
where
she
could
not
even
hear
from
him
who
was
her
life
yet
immolation
in
the
dreary
convent
where
for
nearly
forty
years
she
combated
the
recollection
of
her
folly
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
for
her
it
was
a
cruel
necessity
in
the
convent
she
was
at
least
safe
from
molestation
she
had
every
opportunity
for
study
and
meditation
she
was
free
from
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
removed
from
its
scandals
and
reproach
the
world
was
crucified
to
her
christ
was
now
her
spouse
to
a
convent
also
abélard
retired
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
penitence
at
denis
he
assumed
the
strictest
habits
mortified
his
body
with
severe
austerities
and
renewed
with
ardor
his
studies
in
philosophy
and
theology
he
was
not
without
mental
sufferings
but
he
could
bury
his
grief
in
his
ambition
it
would
seem
that
a
marked
change
now
took
place
in
the
character
of
abélard
he
was
less
vain
and
conceited
and
sought
more
eagerly
the
consolations
of
religion
his
life
became
too
austere
for
his
brother
monks
and
they
compelled
him
to
leave
this
aristocratic
abbey
he
then
resumed
his
lectures
in
the
wilderness
he
retreated
to
a
desert
place
in
champagne
where
he
constructed
a
small
oratory
with
his
own
hands
but
still
students
gathered
around
him
they
too
constructed
cells
like
ancient
anchorites
and
cultivated
the
fields
for
bread
then
as
their
numbers
increased
they
erected
a
vast
edifice
of
stone
and
timber
which
abélard
dedicated
to
the
holy
comforter
and
called
the
paraclete
it
was
here
that
his
best
days
were
spent
his
renewed
labors
and
his
intellectual
boldness
increased
the
admiration
of
his
pupils
it
became
almost
idolatry
it
is
said
that
three
thousand
students
assembled
at
the
paraclete
to
hear
him
lecture
what
admiration
for
genius
when
three
thousand
young
men
could
give
up
the
delights
of
paris
for
a
wilderness
with
abélard
what
marvellous
powers
of
fascination
he
must
have
had
this
renewed
success
in
the
midst
of
disgrace
created
immeasurable
envy
moreover
the
sarcasms
boldness
and
new
views
of
the
philosopher
raised
a
storm
of
hatred
galileo
was
not
more
offensive
to
the
pedants
and
priests
of
his
generation
than
abélard
was
to
the
schoolmen
and
monks
of
his
day
they
impeached
both
his
piety
and
theology
he
was
stigmatized
as
unsound
and
superficial
yet
he
continued
his
attacks
his
ridicule
and
his
sarcasms
in
proportion
to
the
animosities
of
his
foes
was
the
zeal
of
his
followers
who
admired
his
boldness
and
arrogance
at
last
a
great
clamor
was
raised
against
the
daring
theologian
saint
bernard
the
most
influential
and
profound
ecclesiastic
of
the
day
headed
the
opposition
he
maintained
that
the
foundations
of
christianity
were
assailed
even
abélard
could
not
stand
before
the
indignation
and
hostility
of
such
a
saint
a
man
who
kindled
crusades
who
made
popes
who
controlled
the
opinions
of
the
age
abélard
was
obliged
to
fly
and
sought
an
asylum
amid
the
rocks
and
sands
of
brittany
the
duke
of
this
wild
province
gave
him
the
abbey
of
gildas
but
its
inmates
were
ignorant
and
disorderly
and
added
insubordination
to
dissoluteness
they
ornamented
their
convent
with
the
trophies
of
the
chase
they
thought
more
of
bears
and
wild
boars
and
stags
than
they
did
of
hymns
and
meditations
the
new
abbot
now
a
grave
and
religious
man
in
spite
of
his
opposition
to
the
leaders
of
the
orthodox
party
endeavored
to
reform
the
monks
a
hopeless
task
and
they
turned
against
him
with
more
ferocity
than
the
theologians
they
even
poisoned
it
is
said
the
sacramental
wine
he
was
obliged
to
hide
among
the
rocks
to
save
his
life
nothing
but
aid
from
the
neighboring
barons
saved
him
from
assassination
thus
fifteen
years
were
passed
in
alternate
study
glory
suffering
and
shame
in
his
misery
abélard
called
on
god
for
help
his
first
great
advance
in
that
piety
which
detractors
depreciated
he
wrote
also
to
a
friend
a
history
of
his
misfortunes
by
accident
this
history
fell
into
the
hands
of
héloïse
then
abbess
of
the
paraclete
which
abélard
had
given
her
and
where
she
was
greatly
revered
for
all
those
virtues
most
esteemed
in
her
age
it
opened
her
wound
afresh
and
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband
such
as
has
seldom
been
equalled
for
pathos
and
depth
of
sentiment
it
is
an
immortal
record
of
her
grief
her
unsubdued
passion
her
boundless
love
not
without
gentle
reproaches
for
what
seemed
a
cold
neglect
and
silence
for
fifteen
long
and
bitter
years
yet
breathing
forgiveness
admiration
affection
the
salutation
of
that
letter
is
remarkable
héloïse
to
her
lord
to
her
father
to
her
husband
to
her
brother
his
servant
yes
his
daughter
his
wife
yes
his
sister
thus
does
she
begin
that
tender
and
long
letter
in
which
she
describes
her
sufferings
her
unchanged
affections
her
ardent
wishes
for
his
welfare
revealing
in
every
line
not
merely
genius
and
sensibility
but
a
lofty
and
magnanimous
soul
she
glories
in
what
constitutes
the
real
superiority
of
her
old
lover
she
describes
with
simplicity
what
had
originally
charmed
her
his
songs
and
conversation
she
professes
still
an
unbounded
obedience
to
his
will
and
begs
for
a
reply
if
for
nothing
else
that
she
may
be
stimulated
to
a
higher
life
amid
the
asperities
of
her
gloomy
convent
yet
write
oh
write
all
that
i
may
join
grief
to
thy
griefs
and
echo
sighs
to
thine
years
still
are
mine
and
these
i
need
not
spare
love
but
demands
what
else
were
shed
in
prayer
no
happier
task
these
faded
eyes
pursue
to
read
and
weep
is
all
i
now
can
do
abélard
replies
to
this
touching
letter
coldly
but
religiously
calling
her
his
sister
in
christ
but
not
attempting
to
draw
out
the
earthly
love
which
both
had
sought
to
crush
he
implores
her
prayers
in
his
behalf
the
only
sign
of
his
former
love
is
a
request
to
be
buried
in
her
abbey
in
anticipation
of
a
speedy
and
violent
death
most
critics
condemn
this
letter
as
heartless
yet
it
is
but
charitable
to
suppose
that
he
did
not
wish
to
trifle
with
a
love
so
great
and
reopen
a
wound
so
deep
and
sacred
all
his
efforts
now
seem
to
have
been
directed
to
raise
her
soul
to
heaven
but
his
letter
does
not
satisfy
her
and
she
again
gives
vent
to
her
passionate
grief
in
view
of
the
separation
o
inclement
clemency
o
unfortunate
fortune
she
has
so
far
consumed
her
weakness
upon
me
that
she
has
nothing
left
for
others
against
whom
she
rages
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
the
miserable
the
most
unhappy
of
the
unhappy
this
letter
seems
to
have
touched
abélard
and
he
replied
to
it
more
at
length
and
with
great
sympathy
giving
her
encouragement
and
consolation
he
speaks
of
their
mutual
sufferings
as
providential
and
his
letter
is
couched
in
a
more
christian
spirit
than
one
would
naturally
impute
to
him
in
view
of
his
contests
with
the
orthodox
leaders
of
the
church
and
it
also
expresses
more
tenderness
than
can
be
reconciled
with
the
selfish
man
he
is
usually
represented
he
writes
see
dearest
how
with
the
strong
nets
of
his
mercy
god
has
taken
us
from
the
depths
of
a
perilous
sea
observe
how
he
has
tempered
mercy
with
justice
compare
our
danger
with
the
deliverance
our
disease
with
the
remedy
i
merit
death
and
god
gives
me
life
come
and
join
me
in
proclaiming
how
much
the
lord
has
done
for
us
be
my
inseparable
companion
in
an
act
of
grace
since
you
have
participated
with
me
in
the
fault
and
the
pardon
take
courage
my
dear
sister
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chastiseth
sympathize
with
him
who
suffered
for
your
redemption
approach
in
spirit
his
sepulchre
be
thou
his
spouse
then
he
closes
with
this
prayer
when
it
pleased
thee
o
lord
and
as
it
pleased
thee
thou
didst
join
us
and
thou
didst
separate
us
now
what
thou
hast
so
mercifully
begun
mercifully
complete
and
after
separating
us
in
this
world
join
us
together
eternally
in
heaven
no
one
can
read
this
letter
without
acknowledging
its
delicacy
and
its
loftiness
all
his
desires
centred
in
the
spiritual
good
of
her
whom
the
church
would
not
allow
him
to
call
any
longer
his
wife
yet
to
whom
he
hoped
to
be
reunited
in
heaven
as
a
professed
nun
she
could
no
longer
with
propriety
think
of
him
as
an
earthly
husband
for
a
priest
to
acknowledge
a
nun
for
his
wife
would
have
been
a
great
scandal
by
all
the
laws
of
the
church
and
the
age
they
were
now
only
brother
and
sister
in
christ
nothing
escaped
from
his
pen
which
derogates
from
the
austere
dignity
of
the
priest
but
héloïse
was
more
human
and
less
conventional
she
had
not
conquered
her
love
once
given
it
could
not
be
taken
back
she
accepted
her
dreary
immolation
in
the
convent
since
she
obeyed
abélard
both
as
husband
and
as
a
spiritual
father
but
she
would
have
left
the
convent
and
rejoined
him
had
he
demanded
it
for
marriage
was
to
her
more
sacred
than
the
veil
she
was
more
emancipated
from
the
ideas
of
her
superstitious
age
than
even
the
bold
and
rationalistic
philosopher
with
all
her
moral
and
spiritual
elevation
héloïse
could
not
conquer
her
love
and
as
a
wedded
wife
why
should
she
conquer
it
she
was
both
nun
and
wife
if
fault
there
was
it
was
as
wife
in
immuring
herself
in
a
convent
and
denying
the
marriage
it
should
have
been
openly
avowed
the
denial
of
it
placed
her
in
a
false
position
as
a
fallen
woman
yet
as
a
fallen
woman
she
regained
her
position
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
was
a
lady
abbess
it
was
impossible
for
a
woman
to
enjoy
a
higher
position
than
the
control
of
a
convent
as
abbess
she
enjoyed
the
friendship
and
respect
of
some
of
the
saintliest
and
greatest
characters
of
the
age
even
of
such
a
man
as
peter
the
venerable
abbot
of
cluny
and
it
is
impossible
that
she
should
have
won
the
friendship
of
such
a
man
if
she
herself
had
not
been
irreproachable
in
her
own
character
the
error
in
judging
héloïse
is
that
she
as
nun
had
no
right
to
love
but
the
love
existed
long
before
she
took
the
veil
and
was
consecrated
by
marriage
even
though
private
by
the
mediaeval
and
conventional
stand
point
it
is
true
the
wife
was
lost
in
the
nun
that
is
the
view
that
abélard
took
that
it
was
a
sin
to
love
his
wife
any
longer
but
héloïse
felt
that
it
was
no
sin
to
love
him
who
was
her
life
she
continued
to
live
in
him
who
ruled
over
her
and
to
whose
desire
her
will
was
subject
and
obedient
according
to
that
eternal
law
declared
in
the
garden
of
eden
nor
could
this
have
been
otherwise
so
long
as
abélard
retained
the
admiration
of
héloïse
and
was
worthy
of
her
devotion
we
can
not
tell
what
changes
may
have
taken
place
in
her
soul
had
he
been
grovelling
or
tyrannical
a
slave
of
degrading
habits
or
had
he
treated
her
with
cruel
harshness
or
ceased
to
sympathize
with
her
sorrows
or
transferred
his
affections
to
another
object
but
whatever
love
he
had
to
give
he
gave
to
her
to
the
end
so
far
as
the
ideas
of
his
age
would
permit
his
fault
was
in
making
a
nun
of
his
wife
which
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
virtual
repudiation
even
though
from
a
principle
of
sublime
obedience
and
she
consented
to
the
separation
was
josephine
to
blame
because
she
loved
a
selfish
man
after
she
was
repudiated
héloïse
was
simply
unable
to
conquer
a
powerful
love
it
was
not
converted
into
hatred
because
abélard
in
her
eyes
seemed
still
to
be
worthy
of
it
she
regarded
him
as
a
saint
forced
by
the
ideas
of
his
age
to
crush
a
mortal
love
which
she
herself
could
not
do
because
it
was
a
sentiment
and
sentiment
is
eternal
she
was
greater
than
abélard
because
her
love
was
more
permanent
in
other
words
because
her
soul
was
greater
in
intellect
he
may
have
been
superior
to
her
but
not
in
the
higher
qualities
which
imply
generosity
and
sympathy
qualities
which
are
usually
stronger
in
women
than
in
men
in
abélard
the
lower
faculties
ambition
desire
of
knowledge
vanity
consumed
the
greater
could
be
contented
with
the
gratification
of
these
even
as
men
of
a
still
lower
type
can
renounce
intellectual
pleasures
for
the
sensual
it
does
not
follow
that
héloïse
was
weaker
than
he
because
she
could
not
live
outside
the
world
of
sentiment
but
rather
loftier
and
nobler
these
higher
faculties
constituted
her
superiority
to
abélard
it
was
sentiment
which
made
her
so
great
and
it
was
this
which
really
endeared
her
to
abélard
by
reason
and
will
he
ruled
over
her
but
by
the
force
of
superior
sentiment
she
ruled
over
him
sentiment
indeed
underlies
everything
that
is
great
or
lovely
or
enduring
on
this
earth
it
is
the
joy
of
festivals
the
animating
soul
of
patriotism
the
bond
of
families
the
beauty
of
religious
political
and
social
institutions
it
has
consecrated
thermopylae
the
parthenon
the
capitol
the
laurel
crown
the
conqueror
triumphal
procession
the
epics
of
homer
the
eloquence
of
demosthenes
the
muse
of
virgil
the
mediaeval
cathedral
the
of
flanders
the
colleges
of
oxford
and
cambridge
the
struggles
of
the
puritans
the
deeds
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
marseilles
hymn
the
farewell
address
of
washington
there
is
no
poetry
without
it
nor
heroism
nor
social
banqueting
what
is
christmas
without
the
sentiments
which
hallow
the
evergreen
the
anthem
the
mistletoe
the
family
reunion
what
is
even
tangible
and
without
a
party
to
enjoy
them
and
what
is
the
life
of
the
party
but
the
interchange
of
sentiments
why
is
a
cold
or
the
ascent
of
a
mountain
or
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
or
a
rough
journey
under
torrid
suns
to
the
consecrated
places
why
are
these
endurable
and
even
pleasant
it
is
because
the
sentiments
which
prompt
them
are
full
of
sweet
and
noble
inspiration
the
last
supper
and
bethany
and
the
sepulchre
are
immortal
because
they
testify
eternal
love
leonidas
lives
in
the
heart
of
the
world
because
he
sacrificed
himself
to
patriotism
the
martyrs
are
objects
of
unfading
veneration
because
they
died
for
christianity
in
the
same
way
héloïse
is
embalmed
in
the
affections
of
all
nations
because
she
gave
up
everything
for
an
exalted
sentiment
which
so
possessed
her
soul
that
neither
scorn
nor
pity
nor
ascetic
severities
nor
gloomy
isolation
nor
ingratitude
nor
a
living
death
could
eradicate
or
weaken
it
an
unbounded
charity
which
covered
with
its
veil
the
evils
she
could
not
remove
that
and
sentiment
was
the
admiration
of
ideal
virtues
and
beauties
which
her
rapt
and
excited
soul
saw
in
her
adored
lover
such
as
dante
saw
in
his
departed
beatrice
it
was
unbounded
admiration
for
abélard
which
first
called
out
the
love
of
héloïse
and
his
undoubted
brilliancy
and
greatness
were
exaggerated
in
her
loving
eyes
by
her
imagination
even
as
mothers
see
in
children
traits
that
are
hidden
from
all
other
mortal
eyes
so
lofty
and
godlike
did
he
seem
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
schools
and
his
triumph
over
all
the
dignitaries
that
sought
to
humble
him
so
interesting
was
he
to
her
by
his
wit
sarcasm
and
eloquence
that
she
worshipped
him
and
deemed
it
the
most
exalted
honor
to
possess
exclusively
his
love
in
return
which
he
gave
certainly
to
no
one
else
satisfied
that
he
the
greatest
man
of
the
world
as
he
seemed
and
as
she
was
told
he
was
should
give
to
her
what
she
gave
to
him
she
exulted
in
it
as
her
highest
glory
it
was
all
in
all
to
her
but
not
to
him
see
then
how
superior
héloïse
was
to
abélard
in
humility
as
well
as
she
was
his
equal
and
yet
she
ever
gloried
in
his
superiority
see
how
much
greater
too
she
was
in
lofty
sentiments
since
it
was
the
majesty
of
his
mind
and
soul
which
she
adored
he
was
comparatively
indifferent
to
her
when
she
became
no
longer
an
object
of
desire
but
not
so
with
her
since
she
was
attracted
by
his
real
or
supposed
greatness
of
intellect
which
gave
permanence
to
her
love
and
loftiness
also
he
was
her
idol
since
he
possessed
those
qualities
which
most
powerfully
excited
her
admiration
this
then
is
love
when
judged
by
a
lofty
standard
worship
of
what
is
most
glorious
in
mind
and
soul
and
this
exalted
love
is
most
common
among
the
female
sex
since
their
passions
are
weaker
and
their
sentiments
are
stronger
than
those
of
most
men
what
a
fool
a
man
is
to
weaken
this
sympathy
or
destroy
this
homage
or
outrage
this
indulgence
or
withhold
that
tenderness
that
delicate
attention
that
toleration
of
foibles
that
sweet
appreciation
by
which
the
soul
of
woman
is
kept
alive
and
the
lamp
of
her
incense
burning
and
woe
be
to
him
who
drives
this
confiding
idolater
back
upon
her
technical
obligations
the
form
that
holds
these
certitudes
of
the
soul
may
lose
all
its
beauty
by
rudeness
or
neglect
and
even
if
the
form
remains
what
is
a
mortal
body
without
the
immortal
soul
which
animates
it
the
glory
of
a
man
or
of
a
woman
is
the
real
presence
of
spiritual
love
which
brings
peace
to
homes
alleviation
to
burdens
consolation
to
sufferings
rest
to
labors
hope
to
anxieties
and
a
sublime
repose
amid
the
changes
of
the
world
that
blessed
flower
of
perennial
sweetness
and
beauty
which
adam
in
his
despair
bore
away
from
eden
and
which
alone
almost
compensated
him
for
the
loss
of
paradise
it
is
not
my
object
to
present
abélard
except
in
his
connection
with
the
immortal
love
with
which
he
inspired
the
greatest
woman
of
the
age
and
yet
i
can
not
conclude
this
sketch
without
taking
a
parting
glance
of
this
brilliant
but
unfortunate
man
and
i
confess
that
his
closing
days
strongly
touch
my
sympathies
and
make
me
feel
that
historians
have
been
too
harsh
in
their
verdicts
historians
have
based
their
opinions
on
the
hostilities
which
theological
controversies
produced
and
on
the
neglect
which
abélard
seemed
to
show
for
the
noble
woman
who
obeyed
and
adored
him
but
he
appears
to
have
employed
his
leisure
and
tranquil
days
in
writing
hymns
to
the
abbess
of
the
paraclete
in
preparing
homilies
and
in
giving
her
such
advice
as
her
circumstances
required
all
his
later
letters
show
the
utmost
tenderness
and
zeal
for
the
spiritual
good
of
the
woman
to
whom
he
hoped
to
be
reunited
in
heaven
and
doing
for
héloïse
what
jerome
did
for
paula
and
fénelon
for
madame
guyon
if
no
longer
her
lover
he
was
at
least
her
friend
and
moreover
at
this
time
he
evinced
a
loftier
religious
life
than
he
has
the
credit
of
possessing
he
lived
a
life
of
study
and
meditation
but
his
enemies
would
not
allow
him
to
rest
even
in
generous
labors
they
wished
to
punish
him
and
destroy
his
influence
so
they
summoned
him
to
an
ecclesiastical
council
to
answer
for
his
heresies
at
first
he
resolved
to
defend
himself
and
bernard
his
greatest
enemy
even
professed
a
reluctance
to
contend
with
his
superior
in
dialectical
contests
but
abélard
seeing
how
inflamed
were
the
passions
of
the
theologians
against
him
and
how
vain
would
be
his
defence
appealed
at
once
to
the
pope
and
rome
of
course
sided
with
his
enemies
he
was
condemned
to
perpetual
silence
and
his
books
were
ordered
to
be
burned
to
this
sentence
it
would
appear
that
abélard
prepared
to
submit
with
more
humility
than
was
to
be
expected
from
so
bold
and
arrogant
a
man
but
he
knew
he
could
not
resist
an
authority
based
on
generally
accepted
ideas
any
easier
than
henry
iv
could
have
resisted
hildebrand
he
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
the
supreme
authority
of
the
church
but
bitterly
felt
the
humiliation
and
the
wrong
broken
in
spirit
and
in
reputation
abélard
now
an
old
man
set
out
on
foot
for
rome
to
plead
his
cause
before
the
pope
he
stopped
on
his
way
at
cluny
in
burgundy
that
famous
monastery
where
hildebrand
himself
had
ruled
now
however
presided
over
by
peter
the
venerable
the
most
benignant
and
charitable
ecclesiastical
dignitary
of
that
age
and
as
abélard
approached
the
gates
of
the
venerable
abbey
which
was
the
pride
of
the
age
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
misfortune
he
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
lordly
abbot
and
invoked
shelter
and
protection
how
touching
is
the
pride
of
greatness
when
brought
low
by
penitence
or
grief
like
that
of
theodosius
at
the
feet
of
ambrose
or
henry
ii
at
the
tomb
of
becket
but
peter
raises
him
up
receives
him
in
his
arms
opens
to
him
his
heart
and
the
hospitalities
of
his
convent
not
as
a
repentant
prodigal
but
as
the
greatest
genius
of
his
age
brought
low
by
religious
persecution
peter
did
all
in
his
power
to
console
his
visitor
and
even
privately
interceded
with
the
pope
remembering
only
abélard
greatness
and
his
misfortunes
and
the
persecuted
philosopher
through
the
kind
offices
of
the
abbot
was
left
in
peace
and
was
even
reconciled
with
bernard
an
impossibility
without
altered
opinions
in
abélard
or
a
submission
to
the
church
which
bore
all
the
marks
of
piety
the
few
remaining
days
of
this
extraordinary
man
it
seems
were
spent
in
study
penitence
and
holy
meditation
so
beloved
and
revered
was
he
by
the
community
among
whom
he
dwelt
that
for
six
centuries
his
name
was
handed
down
from
father
to
son
among
the
people
of
the
valley
and
town
of
cluny
at
the
extremity
of
a
retired
valley
says
lamartine
flanked
by
the
walls
of
the
convent
on
the
margin
of
extensive
meadows
closed
by
woods
and
near
to
a
neighboring
stream
there
exists
an
enormous
under
the
shade
of
which
abélard
in
his
closing
days
was
accustomed
to
sit
and
meditate
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
paraclete
which
he
had
built
and
where
héloïse
still
discharged
the
duties
of
abbess
but
even
this
pensive
pleasure
was
not
long
permitted
him
he
was
worn
out
with
sorrows
and
misfortunes
and
in
a
few
months
after
he
had
crossed
the
hospitable
threshold
of
cluny
he
died
in
the
arms
of
his
admiring
friend
under
the
instinct
of
a
sentiment
as
sacred
as
religion
itself
peter
felt
that
abélard
above
and
héloïse
on
earth
demanded
of
him
the
last
consolation
of
a
reunion
in
the
grave
so
quietly
in
the
dead
of
night
dreading
scandal
yet
true
to
his
impulses
without
a
hand
to
assist
or
an
eye
to
witness
he
exhumed
the
coffin
which
had
been
buried
in
the
abbey
cemetery
and
conveyed
it
himself
to
the
paraclete
and
intrusted
it
to
héloïse
she
received
it
with
tears
shut
herself
up
in
the
cold
vault
with
the
mortal
remains
of
him
she
had
loved
so
well
while
peter
that
aged
saint
of
consolation
pronounced
the
burial
service
with
mingled
tears
and
sobs
and
after
having
performed
this
last
sad
office
and
given
his
affectionate
benediction
to
the
great
woman
to
whom
he
was
drawn
by
ties
of
admiration
and
sympathy
this
venerable
dignitary
wended
his
way
silently
back
to
cluny
and
for
the
greater
consolation
of
héloïse
penned
the
following
remarkable
letter
which
may
perhaps
modify
our
judgment
of
abélard
it
is
no
easy
task
my
sister
to
describe
in
a
few
lines
the
holiness
the
humility
and
the
which
our
departed
brother
exhibited
to
us
and
of
which
our
whole
collected
brotherhood
alike
bear
witness
never
have
i
beheld
a
life
and
deportment
so
thoroughly
submissive
i
placed
him
in
an
elevated
rank
in
the
community
but
he
appeared
the
lowest
of
all
by
the
simplicity
of
his
dress
and
his
abstinence
from
all
the
enjoyments
of
the
senses
i
speak
not
of
luxury
for
that
was
a
stranger
to
him
he
refused
everything
but
what
was
indispensable
for
the
sustenance
of
life
he
read
continually
prayed
often
and
never
spoke
except
when
literary
conversation
or
holy
discussion
compelled
him
to
break
silence
his
mind
and
tongue
seemed
concentrated
on
philosophical
and
divine
instructions
simple
straightforward
reflecting
on
eternal
judgments
shunning
all
evil
he
consecrated
the
closing
hours
of
an
illustrious
life
and
when
a
mortal
sickness
seized
him
with
what
fervent
piety
what
ardent
inspiration
did
he
make
his
last
confession
of
his
sins
with
what
fervor
did
he
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
life
with
what
confidence
did
he
recommend
his
body
and
soul
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
saviour
such
was
the
death
of
abélard
as
attested
by
the
most
venerated
man
of
that
generation
and
when
we
bear
in
mind
the
friendship
and
respect
of
such
a
man
as
peter
and
the
exalted
love
of
such
a
woman
as
héloïse
it
is
surely
not
strange
that
posterity
and
the
french
nation
especially
should
embalm
his
memory
in
their
traditions
héloïse
survived
him
twenty
years
a
priestess
of
god
a
mourner
at
the
tomb
of
abélard
and
when
in
the
solitude
of
the
paraclete
she
felt
the
approach
of
the
death
she
had
so
long
invoked
she
directed
the
sisterhood
to
place
her
body
beside
that
of
her
husband
in
the
same
leaden
coffin
and
there
in
the
silent
aisles
of
that
it
remained
for
five
hundred
years
until
it
was
removed
by
lucien
bonaparte
to
the
museum
of
french
monuments
in
paris
but
again
transferred
a
few
years
after
to
the
cemetery
of
père
la
chaise
the
enthusiasm
of
the
french
erected
over
the
remains
a
beautiful
monument
and
there
still
may
be
seen
day
by
day
the
statues
of
the
immortal
lovers
decked
with
flowers
and
coronets
perpetually
renewed
with
invisible
hands
the
silent
tribute
of
the
heart
of
that
consecrated
sentiment
which
survives
all
change
thus
do
those
votive
offerings
mysteriously
convey
admiration
for
the
constancy
and
sympathy
with
the
posthumous
union
of
two
hearts
who
transposed
conjugal
tenderness
from
the
senses
to
the
soul
who
spiritualized
the
most
ardent
of
human
passions
and
changed
love
itself
into
a
holocaust
a
martyrdom
and
a
holy
sacrifice

joan

heroic
women
perhaps
the
best
known
and
most
popular
of
heroines
is
joan
of
arc
called
the
maid
of
orleans
certainly
she
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
characters
in
the
history
of
france
during
the
middle
ages
hence
i
select
her
to
illustrate
heroic
women
there
are
not
many
such
who
are
known
to
fame
though
heroic
qualities
are
not
uncommon
in
the
gentler
sex
and
a
certain
degree
of
heroism
enters
into
the
character
of
all
those
noble
and
strongly
marked
women
who
have
attracted
attention
and
who
have
rendered
great
services
it
marked
many
of
the
illustrious
women
of
the
bible
of
grecian
and
roman
antiquity
and
especially
those
whom
chivalry
produced
in
mediaeval
europe
and
even
in
our
modern
times
intrepidity
and
courage
have
made
many
a
woman
famous
like
florence
nightingale
in
jewish
history
we
point
to
deborah
who
delivered
israel
from
the
hands
of
jabin
and
to
jael
who
slew
sisera
the
captain
of
jabin
hosts
and
to
judith
who
cut
off
the
head
of
holofernes
it
was
heroism
which
is
ever
allied
with
magnanimity
that
prompted
the
daughter
of
jephtha
to
the
most
remarkable
recorded
in
history
there
was
a
lofty
heroism
in
abigail
when
she
prevented
david
from
shedding
innocent
blood
and
among
the
pagan
nations
who
does
not
admire
the
heroism
of
such
women
as
we
have
already
noticed
chivalry
too
produced
illustrious
heroines
in
every
country
of
europe
we
read
of
a
countess
of
march
in
the
reign
of
edward
who
defended
dunbar
with
uncommon
courage
against
montague
and
an
english
army
a
countess
of
montfort
shut
herself
up
in
the
fortress
of
hennebon
and
successfully
defied
the
whole
power
of
charles
of
blois
jane
hatchett
repulsed
in
person
a
considerable
body
of
burgundian
troops
altrude
countess
of
bertinora
advanced
with
an
army
to
the
relief
of
ancona
bona
lombardi
with
a
body
of
troops
liberated
her
husband
from
captivity
isabella
of
lorraine
raised
an
army
for
the
rescue
of
her
husband
queen
philippa
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
in
scotland
stationed
herself
in
the
castle
of
bamborough
and
defied
the
threats
of
douglas
and
afterwards
headed
an
army
against
david
king
of
scotland
and
took
him
prisoner
and
shut
him
up
in
the
tower
of
london
but
these
illustrious
women
of
the
middle
ages
who
performed
such
feats
of
gallantry
and
courage
belonged
to
the
noble
class
they
were
identified
with
aristocratic
institutions
they
lived
in
castles
they
were
the
wives
and
daughters
of
feudal
princes
and
nobles
whose
business
was
war
and
who
were
rough
and
turbulent
warriors
and
sometimes
no
better
than
robbers
but
who
had
the
virtues
of
chivalry
which
was
at
its
height
during
the
wars
of
edward
iii
and
yet
neither
the
proud
feudal
nobles
nor
their
courageous
wives
and
daughters
took
any
notice
of
the
plebeian
people
except
to
oppress
and
grind
them
down
no
virtues
were
developed
by
feudalism
among
the
people
but
submission
patience
and
loyalty
and
thus
it
is
extraordinary
that
such
a
person
should
appear
in
that
chivalric
age
as
joan
of
arc
who
rose
from
the
humblest
class
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
a
peasant
girl
without
friends
or
influence
living
among
the
vosges
mountains
on
the
borders
of
champagne
and
lorraine
she
was
born
in
in
the
little
obscure
village
of
domremy
on
the
meuse
on
land
belonging
to
the
french
crown
she
lived
in
a
fair
and
fertile
valley
on
the
line
of
the
river
on
the
other
side
of
which
were
the
burgundian
territories
the
lorraine
of
the
vosges
was
a
mountainous
district
covered
with
forests
which
served
for
royal
hunting
parties
the
village
of
domremy
itself
was
once
a
dependency
of
the
abbey
of
remy
at
rheims
this
district
had
suffered
cruelly
from
the
wars
between
the
burgundians
and
the
adherents
of
the
armagnacs
one
of
the
great
feudal
families
of
france
in
the
middle
ages
joan
or
jeanne
was
the
third
daughter
of
one
of
the
peasant
laborers
of
domremy
she
was
employed
by
her
mother
in
spinning
and
sewing
while
her
sisters
and
brothers
were
set
to
watch
cattle
her
mother
could
teach
her
neither
to
read
nor
write
but
early
imbued
her
mind
with
the
sense
of
duty
joan
was
naturally
devout
and
faultless
in
her
morals
simple
natural
gentle
fond
of
attending
the
village
church
devoting
herself
when
not
wanted
at
home
to
nursing
the
sick
the
best
girl
in
the
village
strong
healthy
and
beautiful
a
spirit
lowly
but
poetic
superstitious
but
humane
and
fond
of
romantic
adventures
but
her
piety
was
one
of
her
most
marked
peculiarities
and
somehow
or
other
she
knew
more
than
we
can
explain
of
scripture
heroes
and
heroines
one
of
the
legends
of
that
age
and
place
was
that
the
marches
of
lorraine
were
to
give
birth
to
a
maid
who
was
to
save
the
realm
founded
on
an
old
prophecy
of
merlin
it
seems
that
when
only
thirteen
years
old
joan
saw
visions
and
heard
celestial
voices
bidding
her
to
be
good
and
to
trust
in
god
and
as
virginity
was
supposed
to
be
a
supernal
virtue
she
vowed
to
remain
a
virgin
but
told
no
one
of
her
vow
or
her
visions
she
seems
to
have
been
a
girl
of
extraordinary
good
sense
which
was
as
marked
as
her
religious
enthusiasm
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
young
peasant
girl
is
that
she
claimed
to
have
had
visions
and
heard
voices
which
are
difficult
to
be
distinguished
from
supernatural
something
like
the
daemon
of
socrates
she
affirmed
that
saint
michael
the
archangel
appeared
to
her
in
glory
also
saint
catherine
and
saint
margaret
encouraging
her
in
virtue
and
indicating
to
her
that
a
great
mission
was
before
her
that
she
was
to
deliver
her
king
and
country
such
claims
have
not
been
treated
with
incredulity
or
contempt
by
french
historians
especially
barante
and
michelet
in
view
of
the
wonderful
work
she
was
instrumental
in
accomplishing
at
this
period
france
was
afflicted
with
that
cruel
war
which
had
at
intervals
been
carried
on
for
nearly
a
century
between
the
english
and
french
kings
and
which
had
arisen
from
the
claims
of
edward
i
to
the
throne
of
france
the
whole
country
was
distracted
forlorn
and
miserable
it
was
impoverished
overrun
and
drained
of
fighting
men
the
war
had
exhausted
the
resources
of
england
as
well
as
those
of
france
the
population
of
england
at
the
close
of
this
long
series
of
wars
was
less
than
it
was
under
henry
ii
those
wars
were
more
disastrous
to
the
interests
of
both
the
rival
kingdoms
than
even
those
of
the
crusades
and
they
were
marked
by
great
changes
and
great
calamities
the
victories
of
crécy
poictiers
and
agincourt
which
shed
such
lustre
on
the
english
nation
were
followed
by
reverses
miseries
and
defeats
which
more
than
balanced
the
glories
of
edward
the
black
prince
and
henry
provinces
were
gained
and
lost
yet
no
decisive
results
followed
either
victory
or
defeat
the
french
kings
driven
hither
and
thither
with
a
decimated
people
and
with
the
loss
of
some
of
their
finest
provinces
still
retained
their
sovereignty
at
one
time
about
the
year
edward
iii
had
seemed
to
have
attained
the
supreme
object
of
his
ambition
france
lay
bleeding
at
his
feet
he
had
won
the
greatest
victory
of
his
age
normandy
already
belonged
to
him
guienne
was
recovered
aquitaine
was
ceded
to
him
flanders
was
on
his
side
and
the
possession
of
brittany
seemed
to
open
his
way
to
paris
but
in
fourteen
years
these
conquests
were
lost
the
plague
scourged
england
and
popular
discontents
added
to
the
perplexities
of
the
once
fortunate
monarch
moreover
the
house
of
commons
had
come
to
be
a
power
and
a
check
on
royal
ambition
the
death
of
the
black
prince
consummated
his
grief
and
distraction
and
the
heroic
king
gave
himself
up
in
his
old
age
to
a
disgraceful
profligacy
and
died
in
the
arms
of
alice
pierce
in
the
year
fifty
years
pass
by
and
henry
is
king
of
england
and
renews
his
claim
to
the
french
throne
the
battle
of
agincourt
gives
to
henry
the
same
that
the
victory
of
crécy
had
bestowed
on
edward
iii
again
the
french
realm
is
devastated
by
triumphant
englishmen
the
king
of
france
is
a
captive
his
queen
is
devoted
to
the
cause
of
henry
the
duke
of
burgundy
is
his
ally
and
he
only
needs
the
formal
recognition
of
the
estates
to
take
possession
of
the
french
throne
but
in
the
year
in
the
midst
of
his
successes
he
died
of
a
disease
which
baffled
the
skill
of
all
his
physicians
leaving
his
kingdom
to
a
child
only
nine
years
old
and
the
prosecution
of
the
french
war
to
his
brother
the
duke
of
bedford
who
was
scarcely
inferior
to
himself
in
military
genius
at
this
time
when
charles
vi
of
france
was
insane
and
his
oldest
son
louis
dead
his
second
son
charles
declared
himself
king
of
france
as
charles
vii
but
only
southern
france
acknowledged
charles
who
at
this
time
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
years
all
the
northern
provinces
even
guienne
and
gascony
acknowledged
henry
the
infant
son
of
henry
of
england
charles
affairs
therefore
were
in
a
bad
way
and
there
was
every
prospect
of
the
complete
conquest
of
france
even
paris
was
the
prey
alternately
of
the
burgundians
and
the
armagnacs
the
last
of
whom
were
the
adherents
of
charles
the
dauphin
the
legitimate
heir
to
the
throne
he
held
his
little
court
at
bourges
where
he
lived
as
gaily
as
he
could
sometimes
in
want
of
the
necessaries
of
life
his
troops
were
chiefly
gascons
lombards
and
scotch
who
got
no
pay
and
who
lived
by
pillage
he
was
so
hard
pressed
by
the
duke
of
bedford
that
he
meditated
a
retreat
into
dauphiné
it
would
seem
that
he
was
given
to
pleasures
and
was
unworthy
of
his
kingdom
which
he
nearly
lost
by
negligence
and
folly
the
duke
of
bedford
in
order
to
drive
charles
out
of
the
central
provinces
resolved
to
take
orleans
which
was
the
key
to
the
south
a
city
on
the
north
bank
of
the
loire
strongly
fortified
and
well
provisioned
this
was
in
the
probabilities
were
that
this
city
would
fall
for
it
was
already
besieged
and
was
beginning
to
suffer
famine
in
this
critical
period
for
france
joan
of
arc
appeared
on
the
stage
being
then
a
girl
of
sixteen
some
say
eighteen
years
of
age
although
joan
as
we
have
said
was
uneducated
she
yet
clearly
comprehended
the
critical
condition
of
her
country
and
with
the
same
confidence
that
david
had
in
himself
and
in
his
god
when
he
armed
himself
with
a
sling
and
a
few
pebbles
to
confront
the
giant
of
the
philistines
inspired
by
her
heavenly
visions
she
resolved
to
deliver
france
she
knew
nothing
of
war
she
had
not
been
accustomed
to
equestrian
exercises
like
a
woman
of
chivalry
she
had
no
friends
she
had
never
seen
great
people
she
was
poor
and
unimportant
to
the
eye
of
worldly
wisdom
her
resolution
was
perfectly
absurd
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
joan
finally
obtained
an
interview
with
boudricourt
the
governor
of
vaucouleurs
and
he
laughed
at
her
and
bade
her
uncle
take
her
home
and
chastise
her
for
her
presumption
she
returned
to
her
humble
home
but
with
resolutions
unabated
the
voices
encouraged
her
and
the
common
people
believed
in
her
again
in
the
red
coarse
dress
of
a
peasant
girl
she
sought
the
governor
claiming
that
god
had
sent
her
there
was
something
so
strange
so
persistent
so
honest
about
her
that
he
reported
her
case
to
the
king
meanwhile
the
duke
of
lorraine
heard
of
her
and
sent
her
a
and
the
people
of
vaucouleurs
came
forward
and
helped
her
they
gave
her
a
horse
and
the
dress
of
a
soldier
and
the
governor
yielding
to
her
urgency
furnished
her
with
a
sword
and
a
letter
to
the
king
she
left
without
seeing
her
parents
which
was
one
of
the
subsequent
charges
against
her
and
prosecuted
her
journey
amid
great
perils
and
fatigues
travelling
by
night
with
her
four
armed
attendants
after
twelve
days
joan
reached
chinon
where
the
king
was
tarrying
but
here
new
difficulties
arose
she
could
not
get
an
interview
with
the
king
it
was
opposed
by
his
most
influential
ministers
and
courtiers
why
waste
precious
time
said
they
when
orleans
is
in
the
utmost
peril
to
give
attention
to
a
mad
who
if
not
mad
must
be
possessed
with
a
devil
a
sorceress
to
be
avoided
what
can
she
do
for
france
the
archbishop
of
rheims
the
of
charles
especially
was
against
her
the
learned
doctors
of
the
schools
derided
her
claims
it
would
seem
that
her
greatest
enemies
were
in
the
church
and
the
universities
not
many
wise
not
many
mighty
are
called
the
deliverers
of
nations
in
great
exigencies
rarely
have
the
favor
of
the
great
but
the
women
of
the
court
spoke
warmly
in
joan
favor
for
her
conduct
was
modest
and
irreproachable
and
after
two
days
she
was
admitted
to
the
royal
castle
the
count
of
vendôme
leading
her
to
the
royal
presence
charles
stood
among
a
crowd
of
nobles
all
richly
dressed
but
in
her
visions
this
pure
enthusiast
had
seen
more
glories
than
an
earthly
court
and
she
was
undismayed
to
the
king
she
repeated
the
words
which
had
thus
far
acted
liked
a
charm
i
am
joan
the
maid
sent
by
god
to
save
france
and
she
demanded
troops
but
the
king
was
cautious
he
sent
two
monks
to
her
native
village
to
inquire
all
about
her
while
nobles
and
ecclesiastics
her
she
was
however
treated
courteously
and
given
in
charge
to
the
lieutenant
whose
wife
was
a
woman
of
virtue
and
piety
many
distinguished
people
visited
her
in
the
castle
to
which
she
was
assigned
on
whom
she
made
a
good
impression
by
her
modesty
good
sense
and
sublime
enthusiasm
it
was
long
debated
in
the
royal
council
whether
she
should
be
received
or
rejected
but
as
affairs
were
in
an
exceedingly
critical
condition
and
orleans
was
on
the
point
of
surrender
it
was
concluded
to
listen
to
her
voice
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
age
was
exceedingly
superstitious
and
the
statesmen
of
the
distracted
and
apparently
ruined
country
probably
decided
to
make
use
of
this
girl
not
from
any
cordial
belief
in
her
mission
but
from
her
influence
on
the
people
she
might
stimulate
them
to
renewed
efforts
she
was
an
obscure
and
ignorant
it
was
true
but
god
might
have
chosen
her
as
an
instrument
in
this
way
very
humble
people
with
great
claims
have
often
got
the
ear
and
the
approval
of
the
wise
and
powerful
as
instruments
of
almighty
providence
when
moody
and
sankey
first
preached
in
london
it
was
the
lord
chancellor
and
lord
who
happened
to
be
religious
men
that
amid
the
cynicism
of
ordinary
men
of
rank
gave
them
the
most
encouragement
and
frequently
attended
their
meetings
and
the
voices
which
inspired
the
maid
of
orleans
herself
what
were
these
who
can
tell
who
can
explain
such
mysteries
i
would
not
assert
nor
would
i
deny
that
they
were
the
voices
of
inspiration
what
is
inspiration
it
has
often
been
communicated
to
men
who
can
deny
that
the
daemon
of
socrates
was
something
more
than
a
fancied
voice
when
did
supernatural
voices
first
begin
to
utter
the
power
of
god
when
will
the
voices
of
inspiration
cease
to
be
heard
on
earth
in
view
of
the
fact
that
accomplish
her
mission
the
voices
which
inspired
this
illiterate
peasant
to
deliver
france
are
not
to
be
derided
who
can
sit
in
judgment
on
the
ways
in
which
providence
is
seen
to
act
may
he
not
choose
such
instruments
as
he
pleases
are
not
all
his
ways
mysterious
never
to
be
explained
by
the
reason
of
man
did
not
the
occasion
seem
to
warrant
something
extraordinary
here
was
a
great
country
apparently
on
the
verge
of
ruin
to
the
eye
of
reason
and
experience
it
seemed
that
france
was
to
be
henceforth
ruled
as
a
subjugated
country
by
a
foreign
power
royal
armies
had
failed
to
deliver
her
loyalty
had
failed
to
arouse
the
people
feudal
envies
and
enmities
had
converted
vassals
into
foes
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
most
powerful
vassal
of
france
was
in
arms
against
his
liege
lord
the
whole
land
was
rent
with
divisions
and
treasons
and
the
legitimate
king
who
ought
to
have
been
a
power
was
himself
feeble
frivolous
and
amid
all
his
perils
could
not
save
the
country
who
could
save
it
there
were
no
great
generals
universal
despair
hung
over
the
land
the
people
were
depressed
military
resources
were
insufficient
if
france
was
to
be
preserved
as
an
independent
and
powerful
monarchy
something
extraordinary
must
happen
to
save
it
the
hope
in
feudal
armies
had
fled
in
fact
only
god
could
rescue
the
country
in
such
perils
and
under
such
forlorn
circumstances
joan
of
arc
believed
in
god
that
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
that
he
was
a
power
to
be
supplicated
and
she
prayed
to
him
to
save
france
since
princes
could
not
save
the
land
divided
by
their
rivalries
and
jealousies
and
ambitions
and
the
conviction
after
much
prayer
and
fasting
was
impressed
upon
her
mind
no
matter
how
but
it
impressed
upon
her
that
god
had
chosen
as
his
instrument
that
it
was
her
mission
to
raise
the
siege
of
orleans
and
cause
the
young
dauphin
to
be
crowned
king
at
rheims
this
conviction
gave
her
courage
and
faith
and
intrepidity
how
could
she
unacquainted
with
wars
and
sieges
show
the
necessary
military
skill
and
genius
she
did
not
pretend
to
it
she
claimed
no
other
wisdom
than
that
which
was
communicated
to
her
by
celestial
voices
if
she
could
direct
a
military
movement
in
opposition
to
leaders
of
experience
it
was
only
because
this
movement
was
what
was
indicated
by
an
archangel
and
so
decided
and
imperative
was
she
that
royal
orders
were
given
to
obey
her
one
thing
was
probable
whether
a
supernatural
wisdom
and
power
were
given
her
or
not
she
yet
might
animate
the
courage
of
others
she
might
stimulate
them
to
heroic
action
and
revive
their
hopes
for
if
god
was
with
them
who
could
be
against
them
what
she
had
to
do
was
simply
this
to
persuade
princes
and
nobles
that
the
lord
would
deliver
the
nation
let
the
conviction
be
planted
in
the
minds
of
a
religious
people
that
god
is
with
them
and
in
some
way
will
come
to
their
aid
if
they
themselves
will
put
forth
their
own
energies
and
they
will
be
almost
sure
to
rally
and
here
was
an
inspired
woman
as
they
supposed
ready
to
lead
them
on
to
victory
not
by
her
military
skill
but
by
indicating
to
them
the
way
as
an
interpreter
of
the
divine
will
this
was
not
more
extraordinary
than
the
repeated
deliverances
of
the
hebrew
nation
under
religious
leaders
the
signal
deliverance
of
the
french
at
that
gloomy
period
from
the
hands
of
the
english
by
joan
of
arc
was
a
religious
movement
the
maid
is
to
be
viewed
as
a
religious
phenomenon
she
rested
her
whole
power
and
mission
on
the
supposition
that
she
was
inspired
to
point
out
the
way
of
deliverance
she
claimed
nothing
for
herself
was
utterly
without
vanity
ambition
or
pride
and
had
no
worldly
ends
to
gain
her
character
was
without
a
flaw
she
was
as
near
perfection
as
any
mortal
ever
was
religious
fervent
unselfish
gentle
modest
chaste
patriotic
bent
on
one
thing
only
to
be
of
service
to
her
country
without
reward
and
to
be
of
service
only
by
way
of
encouragement
and
pointing
out
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
direction
of
god
so
joan
fearlessly
stood
before
kings
and
nobles
and
generals
yet
in
the
modest
gentleness
of
conscious
virtue
to
direct
them
what
to
do
as
a
sort
of
messenger
of
heaven
what
was
rank
or
learning
to
her
if
she
was
sent
by
a
voice
that
spoke
to
her
soul
and
that
voice
was
from
god
what
was
human
greatness
to
her
it
paled
before
the
greatness
which
commissioned
her
in
the
discharge
of
her
mission
all
men
were
alike
in
her
eyes
the
distinctions
of
rank
faded
away
in
the
mighty
issues
which
she
wished
to
bring
about
even
the
rescue
of
france
from
foreign
enemies
and
which
she
fully
believed
she
could
effect
with
god
aid
and
in
the
way
that
he
should
indicate
whether
the
ruling
powers
fully
believed
in
her
or
not
they
at
last
complied
with
her
wishes
and
prayers
though
not
until
she
had
been
subjected
to
many
insults
from
learned
priests
and
powerful
nobles
whom
she
finally
won
by
her
modest
and
wise
replies
said
one
of
them
mockingly
if
it
be
god
will
that
the
english
shall
quit
france
there
is
no
need
for
to
whom
she
replied
the
must
fight
and
god
shall
give
the
victory
she
saw
no
other
deliverance
than
through
fighting
and
fighting
bravely
and
heroically
as
the
means
of
success
she
was
commissioned
she
said
to
stimulate
the
men
to
fight
not
to
pray
but
to
fight
she
promised
no
rescue
by
supernatural
means
but
only
through
natural
forces
france
was
not
to
despond
but
to
take
courage
and
fight
there
was
no
imposture
about
her
only
zeal
and
good
sense
to
impress
upon
the
country
the
necessity
of
bravery
and
renewed
exertions
the
maid
set
out
for
the
deliverance
of
the
besieged
city
in
a
attire
deeming
it
more
modest
under
her
circumstances
and
exposing
her
to
fewer
annoyances
she
was
arrayed
in
a
suit
of
beautiful
armor
with
a
banner
after
her
own
device
white
embroidered
with
lilies
and
a
sword
which
had
been
long
buried
behind
the
altar
of
a
church
under
her
inspiring
influence
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
was
soon
collected
commanded
by
the
ablest
and
most
faithful
generals
who
remained
to
the
king
and
accompanied
by
the
archbishop
of
rheims
who
though
he
had
no
great
faith
in
her
claims
yet
saw
in
her
a
fitting
instrument
to
arouse
the
people
from
despair
before
setting
out
from
blois
she
dictated
a
letter
to
the
english
captains
before
the
besieged
city
which
to
them
must
have
seemed
arrogant
insulting
and
absurd
in
which
she
commanded
them
in
god
name
to
return
to
their
own
country
assuring
them
that
they
fought
not
merely
against
the
french
but
against
him
and
hence
would
be
defeated
the
french
captains
had
orders
to
obey
their
youthful
leader
but
not
seeing
the
wisdom
of
her
directions
to
march
to
orleans
on
the
north
side
of
the
loire
they
preferred
to
keep
the
river
between
them
and
the
forts
of
the
english
not
daring
to
disobey
her
they
misled
her
as
to
the
position
of
orleans
and
advanced
by
the
south
bank
which
proved
a
mistake
and
called
forth
her
indignation
since
she
did
not
profess
to
be
governed
by
military
rules
but
by
divine
direction
the
city
had
been
defended
by
a
series
of
forts
and
other
fortifications
of
great
strength
all
of
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
besiegers
only
the
walls
of
the
city
remained
joan
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
for
herself
on
a
white
charger
through
one
of
the
gates
and
the
people
thronged
to
meet
her
as
an
angel
of
deliverance
with
the
wildest
demonstrations
of
joy
her
first
act
was
to
repair
to
the
cathedral
and
offer
up
thanks
to
god
her
next
was
to
summon
the
enemy
to
retire
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
french
troops
entered
the
city
with
supplies
they
then
issued
from
the
gates
to
retake
the
fortifications
which
were
well
defended
cheered
and
encouraged
by
the
heroic
maid
who
stimulated
them
to
daring
deeds
the
french
were
successful
in
their
first
assault
which
seemed
a
miracle
to
the
english
yeomen
who
now
felt
that
they
were
attacked
by
unseen
forces
then
other
forts
were
assailed
with
equal
success
joan
seeming
like
an
inspired
heroine
with
her
eyes
flashing
and
her
charmed
standard
waving
on
to
victory
the
feats
of
valor
which
the
french
performed
were
almost
incredible
joan
herself
did
not
fight
but
stimulated
the
heroism
of
her
troops
the
captains
led
the
assault
the
maid
directed
their
movements
after
most
of
the
forts
were
retaken
the
troops
wished
to
rest
joan
knew
no
rest
nor
fear
nor
sense
of
danger
she
would
hear
of
no
cessation
from
bloody
strife
until
all
the
fortifications
were
regained
at
the
assault
on
the
last
fort
she
herself
was
wounded
but
she
was
as
insensible
to
pain
as
she
was
to
fear
as
soon
as
her
wound
was
dressed
she
hurried
to
the
ramparts
and
encouraged
the
troops
who
were
disposed
to
retire
by
evening
the
last
fort
or
bastile
was
taken
and
the
english
retired
baffled
and
full
of
vengeance
the
city
was
delivered
the
siege
was
raised
not
an
englishman
survived
south
of
the
loire
but
only
part
of
the
mission
of
this
heroic
woman
was
fulfilled
she
had
delivered
orleans
and
saved
the
southern
provinces
she
had
now
the
more
difficult
work
to
perform
of
crowning
the
king
in
the
consecrated
city
which
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
as
well
as
the
whole
country
between
orleans
and
rheims
this
task
seemed
to
the
king
and
his
court
to
be
absolutely
impossible
so
was
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
orleans
according
to
all
rules
of
war
although
priests
nobles
and
scholars
had
praised
the
courage
and
intrepidity
of
joan
and
exhorted
the
nation
to
trust
her
since
god
seemed
to
help
her
yet
to
capture
a
series
of
fortified
cities
which
were
in
possession
of
superior
forces
seemed
an
absurdity
only
the
common
people
had
full
faith
in
her
for
as
she
was
supposed
to
be
specially
aided
by
god
nothing
seemed
to
them
an
impossibility
they
looked
upon
her
as
raised
up
to
do
most
wonderful
things
as
one
directly
inspired
this
faith
in
a
girl
of
eighteen
would
not
have
been
possible
but
for
her
exalted
character
amid
the
most
searching
from
the
learned
she
commanded
respect
by
the
wisdom
of
her
replies
every
inquiry
had
been
made
as
to
her
rural
life
and
character
and
nothing
could
be
said
against
her
but
much
in
her
favor
especially
her
absorbing
piety
gentleness
deeds
of
benevolence
and
utter
unselfishness
there
was
therefore
a
great
admiration
and
respect
for
this
girl
leading
to
the
kindest
and
most
honorable
treatment
of
her
from
both
prelates
and
nobles
but
it
was
not
a
chivalric
admiration
she
did
not
belong
to
a
noble
family
nor
did
she
defend
an
institution
she
was
regarded
as
a
second
deborah
commissioned
to
deliver
a
people
nor
could
a
saint
have
done
her
work
bernard
could
kindle
a
crusade
by
his
eloquence
but
he
could
not
have
delivered
orleans
it
required
some
one
who
could
excite
idolatrous
homage
only
a
woman
in
that
age
was
likely
to
be
deified
by
the
people
some
immaculate
virgin
our
remote
german
ancestors
had
in
their
native
forests
a
peculiar
reverence
for
woman
the
priestesses
of
germanic
forests
had
often
incited
to
battle
their
warnings
or
encouragements
were
regarded
as
voices
from
heaven
perhaps
the
deification
and
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
so
hearty
and
poetical
in
the
middle
ages
may
have
indirectly
aided
the
mission
of
the
maid
of
orleans
the
common
people
saw
one
of
their
own
order
arise
and
do
marvellous
things
bringing
kings
and
nobles
to
her
cause
how
could
she
thus
triumph
over
all
the
inequalities
of
feudalism
unless
divinely
commissioned
how
could
she
work
what
seemed
to
be
almost
miracles
if
she
had
not
a
supernatural
power
to
assist
her
like
the
she
was
and
if
she
was
unlike
common
mortals
perhaps
an
inspired
woman
what
she
promised
would
be
fulfilled
in
consequence
of
such
a
feeling
an
unbounded
enthusiasm
was
excited
among
the
people
they
were
ready
to
do
her
bidding
whether
reasonable
or
unreasonable
to
them
for
there
was
a
sacred
mystery
about
her
a
reverence
that
extorted
obedience
statesmen
and
prelates
had
not
this
unbounded
admiration
although
they
doubtless
regarded
her
as
a
moral
phenomenon
which
they
could
not
understand
her
advice
seemed
to
set
aside
all
human
prudence
nothing
seemed
more
rash
or
unreasonable
than
to
undertake
the
conquest
of
so
many
fortified
cities
with
such
feeble
means
it
was
one
thing
to
animate
starving
troops
to
a
desperate
effort
for
their
deliverance
it
was
another
to
assault
fortified
cities
held
by
the
powerful
forces
which
had
nearly
completed
the
conquest
of
france
the
king
came
to
meet
the
maid
at
tours
and
would
have
bestowed
upon
her
royal
honors
for
she
had
rendered
a
great
service
but
it
was
not
honors
she
wanted
she
seemed
to
be
indifferent
to
all
personal
rewards
and
even
praises
she
wanted
only
one
thing
an
immediate
march
to
rheims
she
even
pleaded
like
a
sensible
general
she
entreated
charles
to
avail
himself
of
the
panic
which
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
orleans
had
produced
before
the
english
could
recover
from
it
and
bring
reinforcements
but
the
royal
council
hesitated
it
would
imperil
the
king
person
to
march
through
a
country
guarded
by
hostile
troops
and
even
if
he
could
reach
rheims
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
take
the
city
than
to
defend
orleans
the
king
had
no
money
to
pay
for
an
army
the
enterprise
was
not
only
hazardous
but
impossible
the
royal
counsellors
argued
but
to
this
earnest
and
impassioned
woman
seeing
only
one
point
there
was
no
such
thing
as
impossibility
the
thing
be
done
the
council
gave
reasons
she
brushed
them
away
as
cobwebs
what
is
impossible
for
god
to
do
then
they
asked
her
if
she
heard
the
voices
she
answered
yes
that
she
had
prayed
in
secret
complaining
of
unbelief
and
that
the
voice
came
to
her
which
said
daughter
of
god
go
on
go
on
i
will
be
thy
help
her
whole
face
glowed
and
shone
like
the
face
of
an
angel
the
king
half
persuaded
agreed
to
go
to
rheims
but
not
until
the
english
had
been
driven
from
the
loire
an
army
was
assembled
under
the
command
of
the
duke
of
alençon
with
orders
to
do
nothing
without
the
maid
advice
joan
went
to
selles
to
prepare
for
the
campaign
and
rejoined
the
army
mounted
on
a
black
charger
while
a
page
carried
her
furled
banner
the
first
success
was
against
jargeau
a
strongly
fortified
town
where
she
was
wounded
but
she
was
up
in
a
moment
and
the
place
was
carried
and
joan
and
alençon
returned
in
triumph
to
orleans
they
then
advanced
against
baugé
another
strong
place
not
merely
defended
by
the
late
besiegers
of
orleans
but
a
powerful
army
under
sir
john
falstaff
and
talbot
was
advancing
to
relieve
it
yet
baugé
capitulated
the
english
being
before
the
city
could
be
relieved
then
the
french
and
english
forces
encountered
each
other
in
the
open
field
victory
sided
with
the
french
and
falstaff
himself
fled
with
the
loss
of
three
thousand
men
the
whole
district
then
turned
against
the
english
who
retreated
towards
paris
while
a
boundless
enthusiasm
animated
the
whole
french
army
soldiers
and
leaders
now
were
equally
eager
for
the
march
to
rheims
yet
the
king
ingloriously
held
back
and
the
coronation
seemed
to
be
as
distant
as
ever
but
joan
with
unexampled
persistency
insisted
on
an
immediate
advance
and
the
king
reluctantly
set
out
for
rheims
with
twelve
thousand
men
the
first
great
impediment
was
the
important
city
of
troyes
which
was
well
garrisoned
after
five
days
were
spent
before
it
and
famine
began
to
be
felt
in
the
camp
the
military
leaders
wished
to
raise
the
siege
and
return
to
the
south
the
maid
implored
them
to
persevere
promising
the
capture
of
the
city
within
three
days
we
would
wait
six
said
the
archbishop
of
rheims
the
chancellor
and
chief
adviser
of
the
king
if
we
were
certain
we
could
take
it
joan
mounted
her
horse
made
preparations
for
the
assault
cheered
the
soldiers
working
far
into
the
night
and
the
next
day
the
city
surrendered
and
charles
attended
by
joan
and
his
nobles
triumphantly
entered
the
city
the
prestige
of
the
maid
carried
the
day
the
english
soldiers
dared
not
contend
with
one
who
seemed
to
be
a
favorite
of
heaven
they
had
heard
of
orleans
and
jargeau
chalons
followed
the
example
of
troyes
then
rheims
when
the
english
learned
of
the
surrender
of
troyes
and
chalons
made
no
resistance
and
in
less
than
a
month
after
the
march
had
begun
the
king
entered
the
city
and
was
immediately
crowned
by
the
archbishop
joan
standing
by
his
side
holding
her
sacred
banner
this
coronation
was
a
matter
of
great
political
importance
charles
had
a
rival
in
the
youthful
king
of
england
the
succession
was
disputed
whoever
should
first
be
crowned
in
the
city
where
the
ancient
kings
were
consecrated
was
likely
to
be
acknowledged
by
the
nation
the
mission
of
joan
was
now
accomplished
she
had
done
what
she
promised
amid
incredible
difficulties
and
now
kneeling
before
her
anointed
sovereign
she
said
gracious
king
now
is
fulfilled
the
pleasure
of
god
and
as
she
spoke
she
wept
she
had
given
a
king
to
france
and
she
had
given
france
to
her
king
not
by
might
not
by
power
had
she
done
this
but
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
she
asked
no
other
reward
for
her
magnificent
service
than
that
her
native
village
should
be
forever
exempt
from
taxation
feeling
that
the
work
for
which
she
was
raised
up
was
done
she
would
willingly
have
retired
to
the
seclusion
of
her
mountain
home
but
the
leaders
of
france
seeing
how
much
she
was
adored
by
the
people
were
not
disposed
to
part
with
so
great
an
instrument
of
success
and
joan
too
entered
with
zeal
upon
those
military
movements
which
were
to
drive
away
forever
the
english
from
the
soil
of
france
her
career
had
thus
far
been
one
of
success
and
boundless
enthusiasm
but
now
the
tide
turned
and
her
subsequent
life
was
one
of
signal
failure
her
only
strength
was
in
the
voices
which
had
bidden
her
to
deliver
orleans
and
to
crown
the
king
she
had
no
genius
for
war
though
still
brave
and
dauntless
though
still
preserving
her
innocence
and
her
piety
she
now
made
mistakes
she
was
also
thwarted
in
her
plans
she
became
perhaps
and
and
assumed
prerogatives
that
only
belonged
to
the
king
and
his
ministers
which
had
the
effect
of
alienating
them
they
never
secretly
admired
her
nor
fully
trusted
her
charles
made
a
truce
with
the
great
duke
of
burgundy
who
was
in
alliance
with
the
english
joan
vehemently
denounced
the
truce
and
urged
immediate
and
uncompromising
action
but
timidity
or
policy
or
political
intrigues
defeated
her
counsels
the
king
wished
to
regain
paris
by
negotiation
all
his
movements
were
dilatory
at
last
his
forces
approached
the
capital
and
occupied
denis
it
was
determined
to
attack
the
city
one
corps
was
led
by
joan
but
in
the
attack
she
was
wounded
and
her
troops
in
spite
of
her
were
forced
to
retreat
notwithstanding
the
retreat
and
her
wound
however
she
persevered
though
now
all
to
no
purpose
the
king
himself
retired
and
the
attack
became
a
failure
still
joan
desired
to
march
upon
paris
for
a
renewed
attack
but
the
king
would
not
hear
of
it
and
she
was
sent
with
troops
badly
equipped
to
besiege
la
charité
where
she
again
failed
for
four
weary
months
she
remained
inactive
she
grew
desperate
the
voices
neither
encouraged
nor
discouraged
her
she
was
now
full
of
sad
forebodings
yet
her
activity
continued
she
repaired
to
compiègne
a
city
already
besieged
by
the
enemy
which
she
wished
to
relieve
in
a
sortie
she
was
outnumbered
and
was
defeated
and
taken
prisoner
by
john
of
luxemburg
a
vassal
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
news
of
this
capture
produced
great
exhilaration
among
the
english
and
burgundians
had
a
great
victory
been
won
the
effect
could
not
have
been
greater
it
broke
the
spell
the
maid
was
human
like
other
women
and
her
late
successes
were
attributed
not
to
her
inspiration
but
to
demoniacal
enchantments
she
was
looked
upon
as
a
witch
or
as
a
sorceress
and
was
now
guarded
with
especial
care
for
fear
of
a
rescue
and
sent
to
a
strong
castle
belonging
to
john
of
luxemburg
in
paris
on
receipt
of
the
news
the
duke
of
bedford
caused
to
be
sung
in
all
the
churches
and
the
university
and
the
vicar
of
the
inquisition
demanded
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
that
she
should
be
delivered
to
ecclesiastical
justice
the
remarkable
thing
connected
with
the
capture
of
the
maid
was
that
so
little
effort
was
made
to
rescue
her
she
had
rendered
to
charles
an
inestimable
service
and
yet
he
seems
to
have
deserted
her
neither
he
nor
his
courtiers
appeared
to
regret
her
captivity
probably
because
they
were
jealous
of
her
gratitude
was
not
one
of
the
virtues
of
feudal
kings
what
sympathy
could
feudal
barons
have
with
a
peasant
girl
they
had
used
her
but
when
she
could
be
useful
no
longer
they
forgot
her
out
of
sight
she
was
out
of
mind
and
if
remembered
at
all
she
was
regarded
as
one
who
could
no
longer
provoke
jealousy
jealousy
is
a
devouring
passion
especially
among
nobles
the
generals
of
charles
vii
could
not
bear
to
have
it
said
that
the
rescue
of
france
was
effected
not
by
their
abilities
but
by
the
inspired
enthusiasm
of
a
peasant
girl
she
had
scorned
intrigues
and
baseness
and
these
marked
all
the
great
actors
on
the
stage
of
history
in
that
age
so
they
said
it
was
a
judgment
of
heaven
upon
her
because
she
would
not
hear
counsel
no
offer
for
her
ransom
no
threats
of
vengeance
came
from
beyond
the
loire
but
the
english
who
had
suffered
most
from
the
loss
of
orleans
were
eager
to
get
possession
of
her
person
and
were
willing
even
to
pay
extravagant
rewards
for
her
delivery
into
their
hands
they
had
their
vengeance
to
gratify
they
also
wished
it
to
appear
that
charles
vii
was
aided
by
the
devil
that
his
cause
was
not
the
true
one
that
henry
vi
was
the
true
sovereign
of
france
the
more
they
could
throw
discredit
and
obloquy
upon
the
maid
of
orleans
the
better
their
cause
would
seem
it
was
not
as
a
prisoner
of
war
that
the
english
wanted
her
but
as
a
victim
whose
sorceries
could
only
be
punished
by
death
but
they
could
not
try
her
and
condemn
her
until
they
could
get
possession
of
her
and
they
could
not
get
possession
of
her
unless
they
bought
her
the
needy
john
of
luxemburg
sold
her
to
the
english
for
ten
thousand
livres
and
the
duke
of
burgundy
received
political
favors
the
agent
employed
by
the
english
in
this
nefarious
business
was
couchon
the
bishop
of
beauvais
who
had
been
driven
out
of
his
city
by
joan
an
able
and
learned
man
who
aspired
to
the
archbishopric
of
rouen
he
set
to
work
to
inflame
the
university
of
paris
and
the
inquisition
against
her
the
duke
of
bedford
did
not
venture
to
bring
his
prize
to
paris
but
determined
to
try
her
in
rouen
and
the
trial
was
intrusted
to
the
bishop
of
beauvais
who
conducted
it
after
the
forms
of
the
inquisition
it
was
simply
a
trial
for
heresy
joan
tried
for
heresy
on
that
ground
there
was
never
a
more
innocent
person
tried
by
the
inquisition
her
whole
life
was
notoriously
virtuous
she
had
been
obedient
to
the
church
she
had
advanced
no
doctrines
which
were
not
orthodox
she
was
too
ignorant
to
be
a
heretic
she
had
accepted
whatever
her
spiritual
teacher
had
taught
her
in
fact
she
was
a
catholic
saint
she
lived
in
the
ecstasies
of
religious
faith
like
a
saint
theresa
she
spent
her
time
in
prayer
and
religious
exercises
she
regularly
confessed
and
partook
of
the
sacraments
of
the
church
she
did
not
even
have
a
single
sceptical
doubt
she
simply
affirmed
that
she
obeyed
voices
that
came
from
god
nothing
could
be
more
cruel
than
the
treatment
of
this
heroic
girl
and
all
under
the
forms
of
ecclesiastical
courts
it
was
the
diabolical
design
of
her
enemies
to
make
it
appear
that
she
had
acted
under
the
influence
of
the
devil
that
she
was
a
heretic
and
a
sorceress
nothing
could
be
more
forlorn
than
her
condition
no
efforts
had
been
made
to
ransom
her
she
was
alone
and
unsupported
by
friends
having
not
a
single
friendly
counsellor
she
was
carried
to
the
castle
of
rouen
and
put
in
an
iron
cage
and
chained
to
its
bars
she
was
guarded
by
brutal
soldiers
was
mocked
by
those
who
came
to
see
her
and
finally
was
summoned
before
her
judges
predetermined
on
her
death
they
went
through
the
forms
of
trial
hoping
to
extort
from
the
maid
some
damaging
confessions
or
to
entangle
her
with
their
sophistical
and
artful
questions
nothing
perhaps
on
our
earth
has
ever
been
done
more
diabolically
than
under
the
forms
of
ecclesiastical
law
nothing
can
be
more
atrocious
than
the
hypocrisies
and
acts
of
inquisitors
the
judges
of
joan
extorted
from
her
that
she
had
revelations
but
she
refused
to
reveal
what
these
had
been
she
was
asked
whether
she
was
in
a
state
of
grace
if
she
said
she
was
not
she
would
be
condemned
as
an
outcast
from
divine
favor
if
she
said
she
was
she
would
be
condemned
for
spiritual
pride
all
such
traps
were
set
for
this
innocent
girl
but
she
acquitted
herself
wonderfully
well
and
showed
extraordinary
good
sense
she
warded
off
their
cunning
and
puerile
questions
they
tried
every
means
to
entrap
her
they
asked
her
in
what
shape
saint
michael
had
appeared
to
her
whether
or
no
he
was
naked
whether
he
had
hair
whether
she
understood
the
feelings
of
those
who
had
once
kissed
her
feet
whether
she
had
not
cursed
god
in
her
attempt
to
escape
at
beauvoir
whether
it
was
for
her
merit
that
god
sent
his
angel
whether
god
hated
the
english
whether
her
victory
was
founded
on
her
banner
or
on
herself
when
had
she
learned
to
ride
a
horse
the
judges
framed
seventy
accusations
against
her
mostly
frivolous
and
some
unjust
to
the
effect
that
she
had
received
no
religious
training
that
she
had
worn
mandrake
that
she
dressed
in
man
attire
that
she
had
bewitched
her
banner
and
her
ring
that
she
believed
her
apparitions
were
saints
and
angels
that
she
had
blasphemed
and
other
charges
equally
absurd
under
her
rigid
trials
she
fell
sick
but
they
restored
her
reserving
her
for
a
more
cruel
fate
all
the
accusations
and
replies
were
sent
to
paris
and
the
learned
doctors
decreed
under
english
influence
that
joan
was
a
heretic
and
a
sorceress
after
another
series
of
insulting
questions
she
was
taken
to
the
of
rouen
to
receive
sentence
and
then
returned
to
her
gloomy
prison
where
they
mercifully
allowed
her
to
confess
and
receive
the
sacrament
she
was
then
taken
in
a
cart
under
guard
of
eight
hundred
soldiers
to
the
place
of
execution
rudely
dragged
to
the
funeral
pile
fastened
to
a
stake
and
fire
set
to
the
faggots
she
expired
exclaiming
jesus
jesus
my
voices
my
voices
thus
was
sacrificed
one
of
the
purest
and
noblest
women
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
a
woman
who
had
been
instrumental
in
delivering
her
country
but
without
receiving
either
honor
or
gratitude
from
those
for
whom
she
had
fought
and
conquered
she
died
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
patriotism
not
for
religion
but
for
her
country
she
died
among
enemies
unsupported
by
friends
or
by
those
whom
she
had
so
greatly
benefited
and
with
as
few
religious
consolations
as
it
was
possible
to
give
never
was
there
greater
cruelty
and
injustice
inflicted
on
an
innocent
and
noble
woman
the
utmost
ingenuity
of
vindictive
priests
never
extorted
from
her
a
word
which
criminated
her
though
they
subjected
her
to
inquisitorial
examinations
for
days
and
weeks
burned
as
an
infidel
her
last
words
recognized
the
saviour
in
whom
she
believed
burned
as
a
witch
she
never
confessed
to
anything
but
the
voices
of
god
her
heroism
even
at
the
stake
should
have
called
out
pity
and
admiration
but
her
tormentors
were
insensible
to
both
she
was
burned
really
from
vengeance
because
she
had
turned
the
tide
of
conquest
the
jews
says
michelet
never
exhibited
the
rage
against
jesus
that
the
english
did
against
the
pucelle
in
whom
purity
sweetness
and
heroic
goodness
dwelt
never
was
her
life
stained
by
a
single
cruel
act
in
the
midst
of
her
torments
she
did
not
reproach
her
tormentors
in
the
midst
of
her
victories
she
wept
for
the
souls
of
those
who
were
killed
and
while
she
incited
others
to
combat
she
herself
did
not
use
her
sword
in
man
attire
she
showed
a
soul
pity
and
gentleness
were
as
marked
as
courage
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
insolvable
questions
in
history
why
so
little
effort
was
made
by
the
french
to
save
the
maid
life
it
is
strange
that
the
university
of
paris
should
have
decided
against
her
after
she
had
rendered
such
transcendent
services
why
should
the
priests
of
that
age
have
treated
her
as
a
witch
when
she
showed
all
the
traits
of
an
angel
why
should
not
the
most
unquestioning
faith
have
preserved
her
from
the
charge
of
heresy
alas
she
was
only
a
peasant
girl
and
the
great
could
not
bear
to
feel
that
the
country
had
been
saved
by
a
peasant
even
chivalry
which
worshipped
women
did
not
come
to
aid
how
great
must
have
been
feudal
distinctions
when
such
a
heroic
woman
was
left
to
perish
how
deep
the
ingratitude
of
the
king
and
his
court
to
have
made
no
effort
to
save
her
joan
made
one
mistake
after
the
coronation
of
charles
vii
she
should
have
retired
from
the
field
of
war
for
her
work
was
done
such
a
transcendent
heroism
could
not
have
sunk
into
obscurity
but
this
was
not
to
be
she
was
to
die
as
a
martyr
to
her
cause
after
her
death
the
english
carried
on
war
with
new
spirit
for
a
time
and
henry
vi
of
england
was
crowned
in
paris
at
notre
dame
he
was
crowned
however
by
an
english
not
by
a
french
prelate
none
of
the
great
french
nobles
even
were
present
the
coronation
was
a
failure
gradually
all
france
was
won
over
to
the
side
of
charles
he
was
a
contemptible
monarch
but
he
was
the
legitimate
king
of
france
all
classes
desired
peace
all
parties
were
weary
of
war
the
treaty
of
arras
in
restored
peace
between
charles
and
philip
of
burgundy
and
in
the
same
year
the
duke
of
bedford
died
in
charles
took
possession
of
paris
in
henry
vi
married
margaret
of
anjou
a
kinswoman
of
charles
vii
in
charles
invaded
normandy
and
expelled
the
english
from
the
duchy
which
for
four
hundred
years
had
belonged
to
the
kings
of
england
soon
after
guienne
fell
in
calais
alone
remained
to
england
after
a
war
of
one
hundred
years
at
last
a
tardy
justice
was
done
to
the
memory
of
her
who
had
turned
the
tide
of
conquest
the
king
ungrateful
as
he
had
been
now
ennobled
her
family
and
their
descendants
even
in
the
female
line
and
bestowed
upon
them
pensions
and
offices
in
twenty
years
after
the
martyrdom
the
pope
commissioned
the
archbishop
of
rheims
and
two
other
prelates
aided
by
an
inquisitor
to
inquire
into
the
trial
of
joan
of
arc
they
met
in
notre
dame
messengers
were
sent
into
the
country
where
she
was
born
to
inquire
into
her
history
and
all
testified
priests
and
peasants
to
the
moral
beauty
of
her
character
to
her
innocent
and
blameless
life
her
heroism
in
battle
and
her
good
sense
in
counsel
and
the
decision
of
the
prelates
was
that
her
visions
came
from
god
that
the
purity
of
her
motives
and
the
good
she
did
to
her
country
justified
her
in
leaving
her
parents
and
wearing
a
man
dress
they
pronounced
the
trial
at
rouen
to
have
been
polluted
with
wrong
and
calumny
and
freed
her
name
from
every
shadow
of
disgrace
the
people
of
orleans
instituted
an
annual
religious
festival
to
her
honor
the
duke
of
orleans
gave
a
grant
of
land
to
her
brothers
who
were
ennobled
the
people
of
rouen
raised
a
stone
cross
to
her
memory
in
the
where
she
was
burned
in
later
times
the
duchess
of
orleans
wife
of
the
son
and
heir
of
louis
philippe
modelled
with
her
own
hands
an
exquisite
statue
of
joan
of
arc
but
the
most
beautiful
and
impressive
tribute
which
has
ever
been
paid
to
her
name
and
memory
was
a
of
three
days
continuance
in
on
the
anniversary
of
the
deliverance
of
orleans
when
the
celebrated
bishop
dupanloup
pronounced
one
of
the
most
eloquent
eulogies
ever
offered
to
the
memory
of
a
heroine
or
benefactor
that
ancient
city
never
saw
so
brilliant
a
spectacle
as
that
which
took
place
in
honor
of
its
immortal
deliverer
who
was
executed
so
cruelly
under
the
superintendence
of
a
christian
bishop
one
of
those
iniquities
in
the
name
of
justice
which
have
so
often
been
perpetrated
on
this
earth
it
was
a
powerful
nation
which
killed
her
and
one
equally
powerful
which
abandoned
her
but
the
martyrdom
of
joan
of
arc
is
an
additional
confirmation
of
the
truth
that
it
is
only
by
that
great
deliverances
have
been
effected
nothing
in
the
moral
government
of
god
is
more
mysterious
than
the
fate
which
usually
falls
to
the
lot
of
great
benefactors
to
us
it
seems
sad
and
unjust
and
nothing
can
reconcile
us
to
the
same
but
the
rewards
of
a
future
and
higher
life
and
yet
amid
the
flames
there
arise
the
voices
which
save
nations
joan
of
arc
bequeathed
to
her
country
especially
to
the
common
people
some
great
lessons
namely
not
to
despair
amid
great
national
calamities
to
believe
in
god
as
the
true
deliverer
from
impending
miseries
who
however
works
through
natural
causes
demanding
personal
heroism
as
well
as
faith
there
was
great
grandeur
in
that
peasant
girl
in
her
exalted
faith
at
domremy
in
her
heroism
at
orleans
in
her
triumph
at
rheims
in
her
trial
and
martyrdom
at
rouen
but
unless
she
had
suffered
nothing
would
have
remained
of
this
grandeur
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
the
injustice
and
meanness
with
which
she
was
treated
have
created
a
lasting
sympathy
for
her
in
the
hearts
of
her
nation
she
was
great
because
she
died
for
her
country
serene
and
uncomplaining
amid
injustice
cruelty
and
ingratitude
the
injustice
of
an
ecclesiastical
court
presided
over
by
a
learned
bishop
the
cruelty
of
the
english
generals
and
nobles
the
ingratitude
of
her
own
sovereign
who
made
no
effort
to
redeem
her
she
was
sold
by
one
potentate
to
another
as
if
she
were
merchandise
as
if
she
were
a
slave
and
those
graces
and
illuminations
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
exalted
her
into
a
catholic
saint
like
an
elizabeth
of
hungary
or
a
catherine
of
sienna
were
turned
against
her
by
diabolical
executioners
as
a
proof
of
heresy
and
sorcery
we
repeat
again
never
was
enacted
on
this
earth
a
greater
injustice
never
did
a
martyr
perish
with
more
triumphant
trust
in
the
god
whose
aid
she
had
so
uniformly
invoked
and
it
was
this
triumphant
christian
faith
as
she
ascended
the
funeral
pyre
which
has
consecrated
the
visions
and
the
voices
under
whose
inspiration
the
maid
led
a
despairing
nation
to
victory

glorious

i
have
already

in

to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
pagan
woman
of
antiquity
revelling
in
the
pleasures
of
vanity
and
sensuality
with
a
feeble
moral
sense
and
without
any
distinct
recognition
of
god
or
of
immortality
the
genius
of
paganism
was
simply
the
deification
of
the
venus
polyhymnia
the
adornment
and
pleasure
of
what
is
perishable
in
man
it
directed
all
the
energies
of
human
nature
to
the
pampering
and
decorating
of
this
mortal
body
not
believing
that
the
mind
and
soul
which
animate
it
and
which
are
the
sources
of
all
its
glory
would
ever
live
beyond
the
grave
a
few
sages
believed
differently
men
who
rose
above
the
spirit
of
paganism
but
not
such
men
as
alexander
or
caesar
or
antony
the
foremost
men
of
all
the
world
in
grand
ambitions
and
successes
taking
it
for
granted
that
this
world
is
the
only
theatre
for
enjoyment
or
action
or
thought
men
naturally
said
let
us
eat
and
drink
and
be
merry
for
we
die
and
hence
no
higher
life
was
essayed
than
that
which
furnished
sensual
enjoyments
or
incited
an
ambition
to
be
strong
and
powerful
of
course
riches
were
sought
above
everything
since
these
furnished
the
means
of
gratifying
those
pleasures
which
were
most
valued
or
stimulating
that
vanity
whose
essence
is
with
this
universal
rush
of
humanity
after
pleasures
which
centred
in
the
body
the
soul
was
left
dishonored
and
uncared
for
except
by
a
few
philosophers
i
do
not
now
speak
of
the
mind
for
there
were
intellectual
pleasures
derived
from
conversation
books
and
works
of
art
and
some
called
the
mind
divine
in
distinction
from
matter
some
speculated
on
the
nature
of
each
and
made
mind
and
matter
in
perpetual
antagonism
as
the
good
and
evil
forces
of
the
universe
but
the
prevailing
opinion
was
that
the
whole
man
perished
or
became
absorbed
in
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
or
reappeared
again
in
new
forms
upon
the
earth
to
expiate
those
sins
of
which
human
nature
is
conscious
to
some
men
were
given
longings
after
immortality
not
absolute
convictions
men
like
plato
socrates
and
cicero
but
i
do
not
speak
of
these
illustrious
exceptions
i
mean
the
great
mass
of
the
people
especially
the
rich
and
powerful
and
those
whose
supreme
delight
was
in
banquets
palaces
or
intoxicating
excitements
like
and
gladiatorial
shows
yea
triumphal
processions
to
raise
the
importance
of
the
individual
self
and
stimulate
vanity
and
pride
hence
paganism
put
a
small
value
comparatively
on
even
intellectual
enjoyments
it
cultivated
those
arts
which
appealed
to
the
senses
more
than
to
the
mind
it
paid
dearly
for
any
sort
of
intellectual
training
which
could
be
utilized
oratory
for
instance
to
enable
a
lawyer
to
gain
a
case
or
a
statesman
to
control
a
mob
it
rewarded
those
poets
who
could
sing
blended
praises
to
bacchus
and
venus
or
who
could
excite
the
passions
at
the
theatre
but
it
paid
still
higher
prices
to
athletes
and
dancers
and
almost
no
price
at
all
to
those
who
sought
to
stimulate
a
love
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
men
like
socrates
for
example
who
walked
barefooted
and
lived
on
fifty
dollars
a
year
and
who
at
last
was
killed
out
of
pure
hatred
for
the
truths
he
told
and
the
manner
in
which
he
told
them
this
martyrdom
occurring
in
the
most
intellectual
city
of
the
world
in
both
greece
and
rome
there
was
an
intellectual
training
for
men
bent
on
utilitarian
ends
even
as
we
endow
schools
of
science
and
technology
to
enable
us
to
conquer
nature
and
to
become
strong
and
rich
and
comfortable
but
there
were
no
schools
for
women
whose
intellects
were
disdained
and
who
were
valued
only
as
servants
or
animals
either
to
drudge
or
to
please
the
senses
but
even
if
there
were
some
women
in
paganism
of
high
mental
education
if
women
sometimes
rose
above
their
servile
condition
by
pure
intellect
and
amused
men
by
their
wit
and
humor
still
their
souls
were
little
thought
of
now
it
is
the
soul
of
woman
not
her
mind
and
still
less
her
body
which
elevates
her
and
makes
her
in
some
important
respects
the
superior
of
man
himself
he
has
dominion
over
her
by
force
of
will
intellect
and
physical
power
when
she
has
dominion
over
him
it
is
by
those
qualities
which
come
from
her
soul
her
superior
nature
greater
than
both
mind
and
body
paganism
never
recognized
the
superior
nature
especially
in
woman
that
which
must
be
fed
even
in
this
world
or
there
will
be
constant
unrest
and
discontent
and
inasmuch
as
paganism
did
not
feed
it
women
were
unhappy
especially
those
who
had
great
capacities
they
may
have
been
comfortable
but
they
were
not
contented
hence
women
made
no
great
advance
either
in
happiness
or
in
power
until
christianity
revealed
the
greatness
of
the
soul
its
perpetual
longings
its
infinite
capacities
and
its
future
satisfactions
the
spiritual
exercises
of
the
soul
then
became
the
greatest
source
of
comfort
amid
those
evils
which
once
ended
in
despair
with
every
true
believer
the
salvation
of
so
precious
a
thing
necessarily
became
the
end
of
life
for
christianity
taught
that
the
soul
might
be
lost
in
view
of
the
soul
transcendent
value
therefore
the
pleasures
of
the
body
became
of
but
little
account
in
comparison
riches
are
good
power
is
desirable
eating
and
drinking
are
very
pleasant
praise
flattery
admiration
all
these
things
delight
us
and
under
paganism
were
sought
and
prized
but
christianity
said
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
christianity
then
set
about
in
earnest
to
rescue
this
soul
which
paganism
had
disregarded
in
consequence
of
this
women
began
to
rise
and
shine
in
a
new
light
they
gained
a
new
charm
even
moral
beauty
yea
a
new
power
so
that
they
could
laugh
at
ancient
foes
and
say
triumphantly
when
those
foes
sought
to
crush
them
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
there
is
no
beauty
among
women
like
this
moral
beauty
whose
seat
is
in
the
soul
it
is
not
only
a
radiance
but
it
is
a
defence
it
protects
women
from
the
wrath
and
passion
of
men
with
glory
irradiating
every
feature
it
says
to
the
boldest
thus
far
shalt
thou
come
and
no
farther
it
is
a
benediction
to
the
poor
and
a
welcome
to
the
rich
it
shines
with
such
unspeakable
loveliness
so
rich
in
blessing
and
so
refined
in
ecstasy
that
men
gaze
with
more
than
admiration
even
with
sentiments
bordering
on
that
adoration
which
the
middle
ages
felt
for
the
mother
of
our
lord
and
which
they
also
bestowed
upon
departed
saints
in
the
immortal
paintings
of
raphael
and
murillo
we
get
some
idea
of
this
moral
beauty
which
is
so
hard
to
copy
so
woman
passed
gradually
from
contempt
and
degradation
to
the
veneration
of
men
when
her
soul
was
elevated
by
the
power
which
paganism
never
knew
but
christianity
in
the
hands
of
degenerate
romans
and
gothic
barbarians
made
many
mistakes
in
its
efforts
to
save
so
priceless
a
thing
as
a
human
soul
among
other
things
it
instituted
monasteries
and
convents
both
for
men
and
women
in
which
they
sought
to
escape
the
contaminating
influences
which
had
degraded
them
if
paganism
glorified
the
body
monasticism
despised
it
in
the
fierce
protests
against
the
peculiar
sins
which
had
marked
pagan
life
gluttony
unchastity
ostentatious
vanities
and
turbulent
mirth
monasticism
decreed
abstinence
perpetual
virginity
the
humblest
dress
the
entire
disuse
of
ornaments
silence
and
meditation
these
were
supposed
to
disarm
the
demons
who
led
into
foul
temptation
moreover
monasticism
encouraged
whatever
it
thought
would
make
the
soul
triumphant
over
the
body
almost
independent
of
it
whatever
would
feed
the
soul
it
said
should
be
sought
and
whatever
would
pamper
the
body
should
be
avoided
as
a
natural
consequence
of
all
this
piety
gradually
came
to
seek
its
most
congenial
home
in
monastic
retreats
and
to
take
on
a
dreamy
visionary
and
introspective
mood
the
saints
saw
visions
of
both
angels
and
devils
and
a
superstitious
age
believed
in
their
revelations
the
angels
appeared
to
comfort
and
sustain
the
soul
in
temptations
and
trials
and
the
devils
came
to
pervert
and
torment
it
good
judgment
and
severe
criticism
were
lost
to
the
church
and
moreover
the
gloomy
theology
of
the
middle
ages
all
based
on
the
fears
of
endless
physical
torments
for
the
wretched
body
was
the
source
of
all
evil
and
therefore
must
be
punished
gave
sometimes
a
repulsive
form
to
piety
itself
intellectually
that
piety
now
excites
our
contempt
because
it
was
so
much
mixed
up
with
dreams
and
ecstasies
and
visions
and
hallucinations
it
produces
a
moral
aversion
also
because
it
was
austere
inhuman
and
sometimes
cruel
both
monks
and
nuns
when
they
conformed
to
the
rules
of
their
order
were
sad
solitary
people
although
their
faces
shone
occasionally
in
the
light
of
ecstatic
visions
of
heaven
and
the
angels
but
whatever
mistakes
monasticism
made
however
repulsive
the
religious
life
of
the
middle
ages
in
fact
all
its
social
life
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
aim
of
the
time
was
high
men
and
women
were
enslaved
by
superstitions
but
they
were
not
pagan
our
own
age
is
in
some
respects
more
pagan
than
were
the
darkest
times
of
mediaeval
violence
and
priestly
despotism
since
we
are
reviving
the
very
things
against
which
christianity
protested
as
dangerous
and
false
the
pomps
the
banquets
the
ornaments
the
arts
of
the
old
pagan
world
now
all
this
is
preliminary
to
what
i
have
to
say
of
saint
theresa
we
can
not
do
justice
to
this
remarkable
woman
without
considering
the
sentiments
of
her
day
and
those
circumstances
that
controlled
her
we
can
not
properly
estimate
her
piety
that
for
which
she
was
made
a
saint
in
the
roman
calendar
without
being
reminded
of
the
different
estimate
which
paganism
and
christianity
placed
upon
the
soul
and
consequently
the
superior
condition
of
women
in
our
modern
times
nor
must
we
treat
lightly
or
sneeringly
that
institution
which
was
certainly
one
of
the
steps
by
which
women
rose
in
the
scale
both
of
religious
and
social
progress
for
several
ages
nuns
were
the
only
charitable
women
except
queens
and
princesses
of
whom
we
have
record
but
they
were
drawn
to
their
calm
retreats
not
merely
to
serve
god
more
effectually
nor
merely
to
perform
deeds
of
charity
but
to
study
as
we
have
elsewhere
said
the
convents
in
those
days
were
schools
no
less
than
asylums
and
hospitals
and
were
especially
valued
for
female
education
however
in
these
retreats
religion
especially
became
a
passion
there
was
a
fervor
in
it
which
in
our
times
is
unknown
it
was
not
a
matter
of
opinion
but
of
faith
in
these
times
there
may
be
more
wisdom
but
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
more
zeal
and
more
unselfishness
and
more
intensity
all
which
is
illustrated
by
the
sainted
woman
i
propose
to
speak
of
saint
theresa
was
born
at
avila
in
castile
in
the
year
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
but
she
really
belonged
to
the
middle
ages
since
all
the
habits
customs
and
opinions
of
spain
at
that
time
were
mediaeval
the
reformation
never
gained
a
foothold
in
spain
none
of
its
doctrines
penetrated
that
country
still
less
modified
or
changed
its
religious
customs
institutions
or
opinions
and
hence
saint
theresa
virtually
belonged
to
the
age
of
bernard
and
anselm
and
elizabeth
of
hungary
she
was
of
a
good
family
as
much
distinguished
for
virtues
as
for
birth
both
her
father
and
mother
were
very
religious
and
studious
reading
good
books
and
practising
the
virtues
which
catholicism
ever
enjoined
to
the
poor
and
kindness
to
the
sick
and
infirm
truthful
chaste
temperate
and
they
had
twelve
children
all
good
though
theresa
seems
to
have
been
the
favorite
from
her
natural
sprightliness
and
enthusiasm
among
the
favorite
books
of
the
middle
ages
were
the
lives
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
the
history
of
these
martyrs
made
so
great
an
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
youthful
theresa
that
she
and
one
of
her
brothers
meditated
a
flight
into
africa
that
they
might
be
put
to
death
by
the
moors
and
thus
earn
the
crown
of
martyrdom
as
well
as
the
eternal
rewards
in
heaven
which
martyrdom
was
supposed
to
secure
this
scheme
being
defeated
by
their
parents
they
sought
to
be
hermits
in
the
garden
which
belonged
to
their
house
playing
the
part
of
monks
and
nuns
at
eleven
theresa
lost
her
mother
and
took
to
reading
romances
which
it
seems
were
books
of
at
the
close
of
the
chivalric
period
these
romances
were
innumerable
and
very
extravagant
and
absurd
and
were
ridiculed
by
cervantes
afterwards
in
his
immortal
don
quixote
although
spain
was
mediaeval
in
its
piety
in
the
sixteenth
century
this
was
the
period
of
its
highest
intellectual
culture
especially
in
the
drama
de
vega
and
cervantes
were
enough
of
themselves
to
redeem
spain
from
any
charges
of
intellectual
stupidity
but
for
the
inquisition
and
the
dominican
monks
and
the
jesuits
and
the
demoralization
which
followed
the
conquests
of
cortés
and
pizarro
spain
might
have
rivalled
germany
france
and
england
in
the
greatness
of
her
literature
at
this
time
there
must
have
been
considerable
cultivation
among
the
class
to
which
theresa
belonged
although
she
never
was
sullied
by
what
are
called
mortal
sins
it
would
appear
that
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
theresa
was
like
most
other
girls
fond
of
dress
and
perfumes
and
ornaments
elaborate
and
of
anything
which
would
make
the
person
attractive
her
companions
also
were
gay
young
ladies
of
rank
as
fond
of
finery
as
she
was
whose
conversation
was
not
particularly
edifying
but
whose
morals
were
above
reproach
theresa
was
sent
to
a
convent
in
her
native
town
by
her
father
that
she
might
be
removed
from
the
influence
of
gay
companions
especially
her
male
cousins
who
could
not
be
denied
the
house
at
first
she
was
quite
unhappy
finding
the
convent
dull
and
strict
i
can
not
conceive
of
a
convent
being
a
very
pleasant
place
for
a
worldly
young
lady
in
any
country
or
in
any
age
of
the
world
its
monotony
and
routine
and
mechanical
duties
must
ever
have
been
irksome
the
pleasing
manners
and
bright
conversation
of
theresa
caused
the
nuns
to
take
an
unusual
interest
in
her
and
one
of
them
in
particular
exercised
a
great
influence
upon
her
so
that
she
was
inclined
at
times
to
become
a
nun
herself
though
not
of
a
very
strict
order
since
she
was
still
fond
of
the
pleasures
of
the
world
at
sixteen
theresa
poor
health
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
return
to
her
father
house
when
she
recovered
she
spent
some
time
with
her
uncle
afterwards
a
monk
who
made
her
read
good
books
and
impressed
upon
her
the
vanity
of
the
world
in
a
few
months
she
resolved
to
become
a
nun
out
of
servile
fear
rather
than
love
as
she
avers
the
whole
religious
life
of
the
middle
ages
was
based
on
fear
the
fear
of
being
tortured
forever
by
devils
and
hell
so
universal
and
powerful
was
this
fear
that
it
became
the
leading
idea
of
the
age
from
which
very
few
were
ever
emancipated
on
this
idea
were
based
the
excommunications
the
interdicts
and
all
the
spiritual
weapons
by
which
the
clergy
ruled
the
minds
of
the
people
on
this
their
ascendency
rested
they
would
have
had
but
little
power
without
it
it
was
therefore
their
interest
to
perpetuate
it
and
as
they
ruled
by
exciting
fears
so
they
themselves
were
objects
of
fear
rather
than
of
love
all
this
tended
to
make
the
middle
ages
gloomy
funereal
repulsive
austere
there
was
a
time
when
i
felt
a
sort
of
poetic
interest
in
these
dark
times
and
called
them
ages
of
faith
but
the
older
i
grow
and
the
more
i
read
and
reflect
the
more
dreary
do
those
ages
seem
to
me
think
of
a
state
of
society
when
everything
suggested
wrath
and
vengeance
even
in
the
character
of
god
and
when
this
world
was
supposed
to
be
under
the
dominion
of
devils
think
of
an
education
which
impressed
on
the
minds
of
interesting
young
girls
that
the
trifling
sins
which
they
committed
every
day
and
which
proceeded
from
the
exuberance
of
animal
spirits
justly
doomed
them
to
everlasting
burnings
without
expiations
a
creed
so
cruel
as
to
undermine
the
health
and
make
life
itself
a
misery
think
of
a
spiritual
despotism
so
complete
that
confessors
and
spiritual
fathers
could
impose
or
remove
these
expiations
and
thus
open
the
door
to
heaven
or
hell
and
yet
this
despotism
was
the
logical
result
of
a
generally
accepted
idea
instead
of
the
idea
being
an
outgrowth
of
the
despotism
since
the
clergy
who
controlled
society
by
working
on
its
fears
were
themselves
as
complete
victims
and
slaves
as
the
people
whom
they
led
this
idea
was
that
the
soul
would
be
lost
unless
sins
were
expiated
and
expiated
by
torments
on
the
body
paul
taught
a
more
cheerful
doctrine
of
forgiveness
based
on
divine
and
infinite
love
on
faith
and
repentance
the
middle
ages
also
believed
in
repentance
but
taught
that
repentance
and
penance
were
synonymous
the
asceticism
of
the
church
in
its
conflict
with
paganism
led
to
this
perversion
of
apostolic
theology
the
very
idea
that
christianity
was
sent
to
subvert
that
is
the
old
oriental
idea
of
seen
among
the
fakirs
and
sofis
and
brahmins
alike
and
in
a
less
repulsive
form
among
the
pharisees
became
once
again
the
ruling
idea
of
theologians
the
theologians
of
the
middle
ages
taught
this
doctrine
of
penance
and
with
peculiar
zeal
and
sincerity
and
fear
rather
than
love
ruled
the
christian
world
hence
the
austerity
of
convent
life
its
piety
centred
in
the
perpetual
crucifixion
of
the
body
in
the
suppression
of
desires
and
pleasures
which
are
perfectly
innocent
the
highest
ideal
of
christian
life
according
to
convent
rules
was
a
living
and
protracted
martyrdom
and
in
some
cases
even
the
degradation
of
our
common
humanity
christianity
nowhere
enjoins
the
eradication
of
passions
and
appetites
but
the
control
of
them
it
would
not
mutilate
and
disfigure
the
body
for
it
is
a
sacred
temple
to
be
made
beautiful
and
attractive
on
the
other
hand
the
middle
ages
strove
to
make
the
body
appear
repulsive
and
the
most
loathsome
forms
of
misery
and
disease
to
be
hailed
as
favorite
modes
of
penance
and
as
christ
suffered
agonies
on
the
cross
so
the
imitation
of
christ
was
supposed
to
be
a
cheerful
and
ready
acceptance
of
voluntary
humiliation
and
bodily
torments
the
more
dreadful
to
bear
the
more
acceptable
to
deity
as
a
propitiation
for
sin
is
this
statement
denied
read
the
biographies
of
the
saints
of
the
middle
ages
see
how
penance
and
voluntary
suffering
and
unnecessary
exposure
of
the
health
and
eager
attention
to
the
sick
in
loathsome
and
contagious
diseases
and
the
severest
and
most
protracted
fastings
and
vigils
enter
into
their
piety
and
how
these
extorted
popular
admiration
and
received
the
applause
and
rewards
of
the
rulers
of
the
church
i
never
read
a
book
which
left
on
my
mind
such
repulsive
impressions
of
mediaeval
piety
as
the
life
of
catherine
of
sienna
by
her
confessor
himself
one
of
the
great
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
of
the
age
i
never
read
anything
so
debasing
and
degrading
to
our
humanity
one
turns
with
disgust
from
the
narration
of
her
lauded
penances
so
we
see
in
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
the
church
of
saint
theresa
two
great
ideas
struggling
for
the
mastery
yet
both
obscured
and
perverted
faith
in
a
crucified
redeemer
which
gave
consolation
and
hope
and
penance
rather
than
repentance
which
sought
to
impose
the
fetters
of
the
ancient
spiritual
despotisms
in
the
early
church
faith
and
repentance
went
hand
in
hand
together
to
conquer
the
world
and
to
introduce
joy
and
peace
and
hope
among
believers
in
the
middle
ages
faith
was
divorced
from
repentance
and
took
penance
instead
as
a
companion
an
old
enemy
so
that
there
was
discord
in
the
christian
camp
and
fears
returned
and
joys
were
clouded
sometimes
faith
prevailed
over
penance
as
in
the
monastery
of
bec
where
anselm
taught
a
cheerful
philosophy
or
in
the
monastery
of
clairvaux
where
bernard
lived
in
seraphic
ecstasies
his
soul
going
out
in
love
and
joy
and
then
again
penance
prevailed
as
in
those
grim
retreats
where
hard
inquisitors
inflicted
their
cruel
torments
but
penance
on
the
whole
was
the
ruling
power
and
cast
over
society
its
funereal
veil
of
dreariness
and
fear
yet
penance
enslaving
as
it
was
still
clung
to
the
infinite
value
of
the
soul
the
grandest
fact
in
all
revelations
and
hence
society
did
not
relax
into
paganism
penance
would
save
the
soul
though
surrounding
it
with
gloom
maceration
heavy
labors
bitter
tears
terrible
anxieties
the
wearied
pilgrim
the
isolated
monk
the
weeping
nun
the
groaning
peasant
the
penitent
baron
were
not
thrown
into
absolute
despair
since
there
was
a
possibility
of
appeasing
divine
wrath
and
since
they
all
knew
that
christ
had
died
in
order
to
save
some
yea
all
who
conformed
to
the
direction
of
those
spiritual
guides
which
the
church
and
the
age
imposed
such
was
catholic
theology
when
theresa
an
enthusiastic
amiable
and
virtuous
girl
of
sixteen
but
at
one
time
giddy
and
worldly
wished
to
enter
a
convent
for
the
salvation
of
her
soul
she
says
she
was
influenced
servile
and
not
by
love
it
is
now
my
purpose
to
show
how
this
servile
fear
was
gradually
subdued
by
divine
grace
and
how
she
became
radiant
with
in
short
an
emancipated
woman
in
all
the
glorious
liberty
of
the
gospel
of
christ
although
it
was
not
until
she
had
passed
through
a
most
melancholy
experience
of
bondage
to
the
leading
ideas
of
her
church
and
age
it
is
this
emancipation
which
made
her
one
of
the
great
women
of
history
not
complete
and
entire
but
still
remarkable
especially
for
a
spanish
woman
it
was
love
casting
out
fear
after
a
mental
struggle
of
three
months
theresa
resolved
to
become
a
nun
but
her
father
objected
partly
out
of
his
great
love
for
her
and
partly
on
account
of
her
delicate
and
fragile
body
her
health
had
always
been
poor
she
was
subject
to
fainting
fits
and
burning
fevers
whether
her
father
at
last
consented
to
her
final
retirement
from
the
world
i
do
not
discover
from
her
biography
but
with
his
consent
or
without
it
she
entered
the
convent
and
assumed
the
religious
habit
not
without
bitter
pangs
on
leaving
her
home
for
she
did
violence
to
her
feelings
having
no
strong
desire
for
monastic
seclusion
and
being
warmly
attached
to
her
father
neither
love
to
god
nor
a
yearning
after
monastic
life
impelled
the
sacrifice
as
she
admits
but
a
perverted
conscience
she
felt
herself
in
danger
of
damnation
for
her
sins
and
wished
to
save
her
soul
and
knew
no
other
way
than
to
enter
upon
the
austerities
of
the
convent
which
she
endured
with
remarkable
patience
and
submission
suffering
not
merely
from
severities
to
which
she
was
unaccustomed
but
great
illness
in
consequence
of
them
a
year
was
passed
in
protracted
miseries
amounting
to
martyrdom
from
fainting
fits
heart
palpitations
and
other
infirmities
of
the
body
the
doctors
could
do
nothing
for
her
and
her
father
was
obliged
to
order
her
removal
to
a
more
healthful
monastery
where
no
vows
of
enclosure
were
taken
and
there
she
remained
a
year
with
no
relief
to
her
sufferings
for
three
months
her
only
recreation
was
books
which
fortified
her
courage
she
sought
instruction
but
found
no
one
who
could
instruct
her
so
as
to
give
repose
to
her
struggling
soul
she
endeavored
to
draw
her
thoughts
from
herself
by
reading
she
could
not
even
pray
without
a
book
she
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
herself
her
situation
was
made
still
worse
by
the
fact
that
her
superiors
did
not
understand
her
when
they
noticed
that
she
sought
solitude
and
shed
tears
for
her
sins
they
fancied
she
had
a
discontented
disposition
and
added
to
her
unhappiness
by
telling
her
so
but
she
conformed
to
all
the
rules
irksome
or
not
and
endured
every
mortification
and
even
performed
acts
of
devotion
which
were
not
required
she
envied
the
patience
of
a
poor
woman
who
died
of
the
most
painful
ulcers
and
thought
it
would
be
a
blessing
if
she
could
be
afflicted
in
the
same
way
in
order
as
she
said
to
purchase
eternal
good
and
this
strange
desire
was
fulfilled
for
a
severe
and
painful
malady
afflicted
her
for
three
years
again
was
she
removed
to
some
place
for
cure
for
her
case
was
desperate
and
here
her
patience
was
supernal
yet
patience
under
bodily
torments
did
not
give
the
peace
it
happened
that
a
learned
ecclesiastic
of
noble
family
lived
in
this
place
and
she
sought
relief
in
confessions
to
him
with
a
rare
judgment
and
sense
and
perhaps
pride
and
delicacy
she
disliked
to
confess
to
ignorant
priests
she
said
that
the
did
her
more
harm
than
good
the
learned
were
probably
more
lenient
to
her
and
more
in
sympathy
with
her
and
assured
her
that
those
sins
were
only
venial
which
she
had
supposed
were
mortal
but
she
soon
was
obliged
to
give
up
this
confessor
since
he
began
to
confess
to
her
and
to
confess
sins
in
comparison
with
which
the
sins
she
confessed
were
venial
indeed
he
not
only
told
her
of
his
slavery
to
a
bad
woman
but
confessed
a
love
for
theresa
herself
which
she
of
course
repelled
though
not
with
the
aversion
she
ought
to
have
felt
it
seems
that
her
pious
talk
was
instrumental
in
effecting
his
deliverance
from
a
base
bondage
he
soon
after
died
and
piously
she
declared
so
that
she
considered
it
certain
that
his
soul
was
saved
theresa
remained
three
months
in
this
place
in
most
grievous
sufferings
for
the
remedy
was
worse
than
the
disease
again
her
father
took
her
home
since
all
despaired
of
her
recovery
her
nervous
system
being
utterly
shattered
and
her
pains
incessant
by
day
and
by
night
the
least
touch
was
a
torment
at
last
she
sank
into
a
state
of
insensibility
from
sheer
exhaustion
so
that
she
was
supposed
to
be
dying
even
to
be
dead
and
her
grave
was
dug
and
the
sacrament
of
extreme
unction
was
administered
she
rallied
from
this
prostration
however
and
returned
to
the
convent
though
in
a
state
of
extreme
weakness
and
so
remained
for
eight
months
for
three
years
she
was
a
cripple
and
could
move
about
only
on
but
she
was
resigned
to
the
will
of
god
it
was
then
amid
the
maladies
of
her
body
that
she
found
relief
to
her
soul
in
prayer
she
no
longer
prayed
with
a
book
mechanically
and
by
rote
but
mentally
with
earnestness
and
with
the
understanding
and
she
prayed
directly
to
god
almighty
and
thereby
came
she
says
to
love
him
and
with
prayer
came
new
virtues
she
now
ceases
to
speak
ill
of
people
and
persuades
others
to
cease
from
all
detractions
so
that
absent
people
are
safe
she
speaks
of
god
as
her
heavenly
physician
who
alone
could
cure
her
she
now
desires
not
sickness
to
show
her
patience
but
health
in
order
to
serve
god
better
she
begins
to
abominate
those
forms
and
ceremonies
to
which
so
many
were
slavishly
devoted
and
which
she
regards
as
superstitious
but
she
has
drawbacks
and
relapses
and
is
pulled
back
by
temptations
and
vanities
so
that
she
is
ashamed
to
approach
god
with
that
familiarity
which
frequent
prayer
requires
then
she
fears
hell
which
she
thinks
she
deserves
she
has
not
yet
reached
the
placidity
of
a
pardoned
soul
perfection
is
very
slow
to
be
reached
and
that
is
what
the
middle
ages
required
in
order
to
exorcise
the
fears
of
divine
wrath
not
however
until
these
fears
are
exorcised
can
there
be
the
liberty
of
the
gospel
or
the
full
triumph
of
love
thus
for
several
years
theresa
passed
a
miserable
life
since
the
more
she
prayed
the
more
she
realized
her
faults
and
these
she
could
not
correct
because
her
soul
was
not
a
master
but
a
slave
she
was
drawn
two
ways
in
opposite
directions
she
made
good
resolutions
but
failed
to
keep
them
and
then
there
was
a
deluge
of
tears
the
feeling
that
she
was
the
weakest
and
wickedest
of
all
creatures
for
nearly
twenty
years
she
passed
through
this
tempestuous
sea
between
failings
and
risings
enjoying
neither
the
sweetness
of
god
nor
the
pleasures
of
the
world
but
she
did
not
lose
the
courage
of
applying
herself
to
mental
prayer
this
fortified
her
this
was
her
stronghold
this
united
her
to
god
she
was
persuaded
if
she
persevered
in
this
whatever
sin
she
might
commit
or
whatever
temptation
might
be
presented
that
in
the
end
her
lord
would
bring
her
safe
to
the
port
of
salvation
so
she
prayed
without
ceasing
she
especially
insisted
on
the
importance
of
mental
prayer
which
is
i
suppose
what
is
called
holy
meditation
as
a
sort
of
treaty
of
friendship
with
her
lord
at
last
she
feels
that
the
lord
assists
her
in
his
great
love
and
she
begins
to
trust
in
him
she
declares
that
prayer
is
the
gate
through
which
the
lord
bestows
upon
her
his
favors
and
it
is
only
through
this
that
any
comfort
comes
then
she
begins
to
enjoy
sermons
which
once
tormented
her
whether
good
or
bad
so
long
as
god
is
spoken
of
for
she
now
loves
him
and
she
can
not
hear
too
much
of
him
she
loves
she
delights
to
see
her
lord
picture
since
it
aids
her
to
see
him
inwardly
and
to
feel
that
he
is
always
near
her
which
is
her
constant
desire
about
this
time
the
confessions
of
saint
augustine
were
put
into
theresa
hands
one
of
the
few
immortal
books
which
are
endeared
to
the
heart
of
christians
this
book
was
a
comfort
and
enlightenment
to
her
she
thinking
that
the
lord
would
forgive
her
as
he
did
those
saints
who
had
been
great
sinners
because
he
loved
them
when
she
meditated
on
the
conversion
of
saint
augustine
how
he
heard
the
voice
in
the
garden
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
lord
equally
spoke
to
her
and
thus
she
was
filled
with
gratitude
and
joy
after
this
her
history
is
the
enumeration
of
the
favors
which
god
gave
her
and
of
the
joys
of
prayer
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
very
joys
of
heaven
she
longs
more
and
more
for
her
divine
spouse
to
whom
she
is
spiritually
wedded
she
pants
for
him
as
the
hart
pants
for
the
she
can
not
be
separated
from
him
neither
death
nor
hell
can
separate
her
from
his
love
he
is
infinitely
precious
to
her
he
is
chief
among
ten
thousand
she
blesses
his
holy
name
in
her
exceeding
joy
she
cries
o
lord
of
my
soul
o
my
eternal
good
in
her
ecstasy
she
sings
absent
from
thee
my
saviour
dear
i
call
not
life
this
living
here
ah
lord
i
my
light
and
living
breath
take
me
oh
take
me
from
this
death
and
burst
the
bars
that
sever
me
from
my
true
life
above
think
how
i
die
thy
face
to
see
and
can
not
live
away
from
thee
o
my
eternal
love
thus
she
composes
canticles
and
dries
her
tears
feeling
that
the
love
of
god
does
not
consist
in
these
but
in
serving
him
with
fidelity
and
devotion
she
is
filled
with
the
graces
of
humility
and
praises
god
that
she
is
permitted
to
speak
of
things
relating
to
him
she
is
filled
also
with
strength
since
it
is
he
who
strengthens
her
she
is
perpetually
refreshed
since
she
drinks
from
a
divine
fountain
she
is
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
delight
from
the
enjoyment
of
divine
blessings
her
soul
is
elevated
to
rapture
she
feels
that
her
salvation
through
grace
is
assured
she
no
longer
has
fear
of
devils
or
of
hell
since
with
an
everlasting
love
she
is
beloved
and
her
lover
is
christ
she
has
broken
the
bondage
of
the
middle
ages
and
she
has
broken
it
by
prayer
she
is
an
emancipated
woman
and
can
now
afford
to
devote
herself
to
practical
duties
she
visits
the
sick
she
dispenses
charities
she
gives
wise
counsels
for
with
all
her
visionary
piety
she
has
good
sense
in
the
things
of
the
world
and
is
as
practical
as
she
is
spiritual
and
transcendental
and
all
this
in
the
midst
of
visions
i
will
not
dwell
on
these
visions
the
weak
point
in
her
religious
life
though
they
are
visions
of
beauty
not
of
devils
of
celestial
spirits
who
came
to
comfort
her
and
who
filled
her
soul
with
joy
and
peace
a
little
bird
i
am
shut
from
the
fields
of
air
and
in
my
cage
i
sit
and
sing
to
him
who
placed
me
there
well
pleased
a
prisoner
to
be
because
my
god
it
pleases
thee
she
is
bathed
in
the
glory
of
her
lord
and
her
face
shines
with
the
radiance
of
heaven
with
the
moral
beauty
which
the
greatest
of
spanish
painters
represents
on
his
canvas
and
she
is
beloved
by
everybody
is
universally
venerated
for
her
virtues
as
well
as
for
her
spiritual
elevation
the
greatest
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
come
to
see
her
and
encourage
her
and
hold
converse
with
her
for
her
intellectual
gifts
were
as
remarkable
as
her
piety
her
conversation
it
appears
was
charming
her
influence
over
the
highest
people
was
immense
she
pleased
she
softened
and
she
elevated
all
who
knew
her
she
reigned
in
her
convent
as
madame
de
staël
reigned
in
her
she
was
supposed
to
have
reached
perfection
and
yet
she
never
claimed
perfection
but
sadly
felt
her
imperfections
and
confessed
them
she
was
very
fond
of
the
society
of
learned
men
from
first
to
last
but
formed
no
friendships
except
with
those
whom
she
believed
to
be
faithful
servants
of
god
at
this
period
theresa
meditated
the
foundation
of
a
new
convent
of
the
carmelite
order
to
be
called
joseph
after
the
name
of
her
patron
saint
but
here
she
found
great
difficulty
as
her
plans
were
not
generally
approved
by
her
superiors
or
the
learned
men
whom
she
consulted
they
were
deemed
impracticable
for
she
insisted
that
the
convent
should
not
be
endowed
nor
be
allowed
to
possess
property
in
all
the
monasteries
of
the
middle
ages
the
monks
if
individually
poor
might
be
collectively
rich
and
all
the
famous
monasteries
came
gradually
to
be
as
well
endowed
as
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
were
this
proved
in
the
end
an
evil
since
the
monks
became
lazy
and
luxurious
and
proud
they
could
afford
to
be
idle
and
with
idleness
and
luxury
came
corruption
the
austere
lives
of
the
founders
of
these
monasteries
gave
them
a
reputation
for
sanctity
and
learning
and
this
brought
them
wealth
rich
people
who
had
no
near
relatives
were
almost
certain
to
leave
them
something
in
their
wills
and
the
richer
the
monasteries
became
the
greedier
their
rulers
were
theresa
determined
to
set
a
new
example
she
did
not
institute
any
stricter
rules
she
was
emancipated
from
austerities
but
she
resolved
to
make
her
nuns
dependent
on
the
lord
rather
than
on
rich
people
nor
was
she
ambitious
of
founding
a
large
convent
she
thought
that
thirteen
women
together
were
enough
gradually
she
brought
the
provincial
of
the
order
over
to
her
views
and
also
the
celebrated
friar
peter
of
alcantara
the
most
eminent
ecclesiastic
in
spain
but
the
townspeople
of
avila
were
full
of
opposition
they
said
it
was
better
for
theresa
to
remain
where
she
was
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
another
convent
and
that
it
was
a
very
foolish
thing
so
great
was
the
outcry
that
the
provincial
finally
withdrew
his
consent
he
also
deemed
the
revenue
to
be
too
uncertain
then
the
advice
of
a
celebrated
dominican
was
sought
who
took
eight
days
to
consider
the
matter
and
was
at
first
inclined
to
recommend
the
abandonment
of
the
project
but
on
further
reflection
he
could
see
no
harm
in
it
and
encouraged
it
so
a
small
house
was
bought
for
the
nuns
must
have
some
shelter
over
their
heads
the
provincial
changed
his
opinion
again
and
now
favored
the
enterprise
it
was
a
small
affair
but
a
great
thing
to
theresa
her
friend
the
dominican
wrote
letters
to
rome
and
the
provincial
offered
no
further
objection
moreover
she
had
bright
visions
of
celestial
comforters
but
the
superior
of
her
convent
not
wishing
the
enterprise
to
succeed
and
desiring
to
get
her
out
of
the
way
sent
theresa
to
toledo
to
visit
and
comfort
a
sick
lady
of
rank
with
whom
she
remained
six
months
here
she
met
many
eminent
men
chiefly
ecclesiastics
of
the
dominican
and
jesuit
orders
and
here
she
inspired
other
ladies
to
follow
her
example
among
others
a
noble
nun
of
her
own
order
who
sold
all
she
had
and
walked
to
rome
barefooted
in
order
to
obtain
leave
to
establish
a
religious
house
like
that
proposed
by
theresa
at
last
there
came
letters
and
a
brief
from
rome
for
the
establishment
of
the
convent
and
theresa
was
elected
prioress
in
the
year
but
the
opposition
still
continued
and
the
most
learned
and
influential
were
resolved
on
disestablishing
the
house
the
matter
at
last
reached
the
ears
of
the
king
and
council
and
an
order
came
requiring
a
statement
as
to
how
the
monastery
was
to
be
founded
everything
was
discouraging
theresa
as
usual
took
refuge
in
prayer
and
went
to
the
lord
and
said
this
house
is
not
mine
it
is
established
for
thee
and
since
there
is
no
one
to
conduct
the
case
do
thou
undertake
it
from
that
time
she
considered
the
matter
settled
nevertheless
the
opposition
continued
much
to
the
astonishment
of
theresa
who
could
not
see
how
a
prioress
and
twelve
nuns
could
be
injurious
to
the
city
finally
opposition
so
far
ceased
that
it
was
agreed
that
the
house
should
be
unmolested
provided
it
were
endowed
on
this
point
however
theresa
was
firm
feeling
that
if
she
once
began
to
admit
revenue
the
people
would
not
afterwards
allow
her
to
refuse
it
so
amid
great
opposition
she
at
last
took
up
her
abode
in
the
convent
she
had
founded
and
wanted
for
nothing
since
alms
all
unsolicited
poured
in
sufficient
for
all
necessities
and
the
attention
of
the
nuns
was
given
to
their
duties
without
anxieties
or
obstruction
in
all
the
dignity
of
voluntary
poverty
i
look
upon
this
reformation
of
the
carmelite
order
as
very
remarkable
the
nuns
did
not
go
around
among
rich
people
supplicating
their
aid
as
was
generally
customary
for
no
convent
or
monastery
was
ever
rich
enough
in
its
own
opinion
still
less
did
they
say
to
rich
people
ye
are
the
lords
and
masters
of
mankind
we
recognize
your
greatness
and
your
power
deign
to
give
us
from
your
abundance
not
that
we
may
live
comfortably
when
serving
the
lord
but
live
in
luxury
like
you
and
compete
with
you
in
the
sumptuousness
of
our
banquets
and
in
the
costliness
of
our
furniture
and
our
works
of
art
and
be
your
companions
and
equals
in
social
distinctions
and
be
enrolled
with
you
as
leaders
of
society
on
the
contrary
they
said
we
ask
nothing
from
you
we
do
not
wish
to
be
rich
we
prefer
poverty
we
would
not
be
encumbered
with
useless
impediments
too
much
camp
equipage
while
marching
to
do
battle
with
the
forces
of
the
devil
christ
is
our
captain
he
can
take
care
of
his
own
troops
he
will
not
let
us
starve
and
if
we
do
suffer
what
of
that
he
suffered
for
our
sake
shall
we
not
suffer
for
his
cause
the
convent
of
joseph
was
founded
in
after
theresa
had
passed
years
in
the
convent
of
the
incarnation
she
died
at
the
age
of
after
twenty
years
of
successful
labors
in
the
convent
she
had
founded
revered
by
everybody
the
friend
of
some
of
the
most
eminent
men
in
spain
including
the
celebrated
borgia
of
candia
and
general
of
the
jesuits
who
took
the
same
interest
in
theresa
that
fénelon
did
in
madame
guyon
she
lived
to
see
established
sixteen
convents
of
nuns
all
obeying
her
reformed
rule
and
most
of
them
founded
by
her
amid
great
difficulties
and
opposition
when
she
founded
the
carmelite
convent
of
toledo
she
had
only
four
ducats
to
begin
with
some
one
objected
to
the
smallness
of
the
sum
when
she
replied
theresa
and
this
money
are
indeed
nothing
but
god
and
theresa
and
four
ducats
can
accomplish
anything
it
was
amid
the
fatigues
incident
to
the
founding
a
convent
in
burgos
that
she
sickened
and
died
it
was
not
however
merely
from
her
labors
as
a
reformer
and
nun
that
saint
theresa
won
her
fame
but
also
for
her
writings
which
blaze
with
genius
although
chiefly
confined
to
her
own
religious
experience
these
consist
of
an
account
of
her
own
life
and
various
letters
and
mystic
treatises
some
description
of
her
spiritual
conflicts
and
ecstasies
others
giving
accounts
of
her
religious
labors
in
the
founding
of
reformed
orders
and
convents
while
the
most
famous
is
a
rapt
portrayal
of
the
progress
of
the
soul
to
the
highest
heaven
her
own
memoirs
remind
one
of
the
confessions
of
saint
augustine
and
of
the
imitation
of
christ
by
thomas
à
kempis
people
do
not
read
such
books
in
these
times
to
any
extent
at
least
in
this
country
but
they
have
ever
been
highly
valued
on
the
continent
of
europe
the
biographers
of
saint
theresa
have
been
numerous
some
of
them
very
distinguished
like
ribera
yepez
and
sainte
marie
bossuet
while
he
condemned
madame
guyon
for
the
same
mystical
piety
which
marked
saint
theresa
still
bowed
down
to
the
authority
of
the
writings
of
the
saint
while
fleury
quotes
them
with
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
trent
but
saint
theresa
ever
was
submissive
to
the
authority
of
the
pope
and
of
her
spiritual
directors
she
would
not
have
been
canonized
by
gregory
xv
had
she
not
been
so
long
as
priests
and
nuns
have
been
submissive
to
the
authority
of
the
church
the
church
has
been
lenient
to
their
opinions
until
the
reformation
there
was
great
practical
freedom
of
opinion
in
the
catholic
church
nor
was
the
church
of
the
sixteenth
century
able
to
see
the
logical
tendency
of
the
mysticism
of
saint
theresa
since
it
was
not
coupled
with
rebellion
against
spiritual
despotism
it
was
not
until
the
logical
and
dogmatic
intellect
of
bossuet
discerned
the
spiritual
independence
of
the
jansenists
and
quietists
that
persecution
began
against
them
had
saint
theresa
lived
a
century
later
she
would
probably
have
shared
the
fate
of
madame
guyon
whom
she
resembled
more
closely
than
any
other
woman
that
i
have
read
of
in
her
social
position
in
her
practical
intellect
despite
the
visions
of
a
dreamy
piety
in
her
passionate
love
of
the
saviour
in
her
method
of
prayer
in
her
spiritual
conflicts
in
the
benevolence
which
marked
all
her
relations
with
the
world
in
the
divine
charity
which
breathed
through
all
her
words
and
in
the
triumph
of
love
over
all
the
fears
inspired
by
a
gloomy
theology
and
a
superstitious
priesthood
both
of
these
eminent
women
were
poets
of
no
ordinary
merit
both
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
the
most
eminent
men
of
their
age
both
craved
the
society
of
the
learned
both
were
of
high
birth
and
beautiful
in
their
youth
and
fitted
to
adorn
society
by
their
brilliant
talk
as
well
as
graceful
manners
both
were
amiable
and
sought
to
please
and
loved
distinction
and
appreciation
both
were
catholics
yet
permeated
with
the
spirit
of
protestantism
so
far
as
religion
is
made
a
matter
between
god
and
the
individual
soul
and
marked
by
internal
communion
with
the
deity
rather
than
by
outward
acts
of
prescribed
forms
both
had
confessors
and
yet
both
maintained
the
freedom
of
their
minds
and
souls
and
knew
of
no
binding
authority
but
that
divine
voice
which
appealed
to
their
conscience
and
heart
and
that
divine
word
which
is
written
in
the
scriptures
after
the
love
of
god
had
subdued
their
hearts
we
read
but
little
of
penances
or
or
forms
of
worship
or
church
ceremonies
or
priestly
rigors
or
any
of
the
slaveries
and
formalities
which
bound
ordinary
people
their
piety
was
mystical
sometimes
visionary
and
not
always
intelligible
but
deep
sincere
and
lofty
of
the
two
women
i
think
saint
theresa
was
the
more
remarkable
and
had
the
most
originality
madame
guyon
seems
to
have
borrowed
much
from
her
especially
in
her
methods
of
prayer
the
influence
of
saint
theresa
life
and
writings
has
been
eminent
and
marked
not
only
in
the
catholic
but
in
the
protestant
church
if
not
direct
it
has
been
indirect
she
had
that
active
ardent
nature
which
sets
at
defiance
a
formal
piety
and
became
an
example
to
noble
women
in
a
more
enlightened
if
less
poetic
age
she
was
the
precursor
of
a
madame
de
chantal
of
a
francis
de
sales
of
a
mère
angelique
the
learned
and
saintly
port
royalists
in
many
respects
were
her
disciples
we
even
see
a
resemblance
to
her
spiritual
exercises
in
the
thoughts
of
pascal
we
see
her
mystical
love
of
the
saviour
in
the
poetry
of
cowper
and
watts
and
wesley
the
same
sentiments
she
uttered
appear
even
in
the
devotional
works
of
jeremy
taylor
and
jonathan
edwards
the
protestant
theology
of
the
last
century
was
in
harmony
with
hers
in
its
essential
features
in
the
pilgrim
progress
of
bunyan
we
have
no
more
graphic
pictures
of
the
sense
of
sin
the
justice
of
its
punishment
and
the
power
by
which
it
is
broken
than
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
this
saintly
woman
in
no
protestant
hymnals
do
we
find
a
warmer
desire
for
a
spiritual
union
with
the
author
of
our
salvation
in
none
do
we
see
the
aspiring
soul
seeking
to
climb
to
the
regions
of
eternal
love
more
than
in
her
exultant
melodies
for
uncreated
charms
i
burn
oppressed
by
slavish
fears
no
more
for
in
whom
i
may
discern

theresa
in
fact
to
all
those
who
have
been
distinguished
for
an
inward
life
from
saint
augustine
to
richard

unselfish
love

divine

meditation
too
deep
for

this

it

both
among
catholic

protestant
saints
it
may
seem
to
some

to
others

but
this
has
been
the
life
and

it
has
raised
them
above
the
despair

as
one
of
those

women
who
have
exerted
a
powerful
influence
on
the
political
destinies
of
a
nation
since
she
was
the
life
of
the
french
monarchy
for
more
than
thirty
years
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
in
the
earlier
part
of
her
career
she
was
a
queen
of
society

her
social
triumphs
pale
before
the
lustre
of
that
power
which
she
exercised
as
the
wife
of
the
greatest
monarch
of
the
age
so
far
as
splendor
and
magnificence
can
make
a
monarch
great
no
woman
in
modern
times
ever
rose
so
high
from
a
humble
position
with
the
exception
of
catherine
i
wife
of
peter
the
great
she
was
not
born
a
duchess
like
some
of
those
brilliant
women
who
shed
glory
around
the
absolute
throne
of
the
proudest
monarch
of
his
century
but
rose
to
her
magnificent
position
by
pure
merit
her
graces
her
virtues
and
her
abilities
having
won
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
overlauded
but
sagacious
king
of
france
and
yet
she
was
well
born
so
far
as
blood
is
concerned
since
the
protestant
family
of
to
which
she
belonged
was
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
kingdom
her
father
however
was
a
man
of
reckless
extravagance
and
infamous
habits
and
committed
follies
and
crimes
which
caused
him
to
be
imprisoned
in
bordeaux
while
in
prison
he
compromised
the
character
of
the
daughter
of
his
jailer
and
by
her
means
escaped
to
america
he
returned
and
was
again
arrested
his
wife
followed
him
to
his
cell
and
it
was
in
this
cell
that
the
subject
of
this
lecture
was
born
subsequently
her
miserable
father
obtained
his
release
sailed
with
his
family
to
martinique
and
died
there
in
extreme
poverty
his
wife
returned
to
france
and
got
her
living
by
her
needle
until
she
too
worn
out
by
poverty
and
misfortune
died
leaving
her
daughter
to
strive
as
she
had
striven
with
a
cold
and
heartless
world
this
daughter
became
at
first
a
humble
dependent
on
one
of
her
rich
relatives
and
the
future
wife
of
louis
xiv
could
be
seen
on
a
morning
assisting
the
coachmen
to
groom
the
horses
or
following
a
flock
of
turkeys
with
her
breakfast
in
a
basket
but
she
was
beautiful
and
bright
and
panted
like
most
ambitious
girls
for
an
entrance
into
what
is
called
society
society
at
that
time
in
france
was
brilliant
intellectual
and
wicked
there
was
the
blending
of
calculating
interest
and
religious
asceticism
when
women
of
the
world
after
having
exhausted
its
pleasures
retired
to
cloisters
and
sacrificed
their
natural
affections
to
family
pride
it
was
an
age
of
intellectual
idlers
when
men
and
women
having
nothing
to
do
spent
their
time
in
and
learned
the
art
of
conversation
which
was
followed
by
the
art
of
to
reach
the
of
and
people
where
rank
and
wealth
were
balanced
by
wit
became
the
desire
of
the
young
mademoiselle
her
entrance
into
society
was
effected
in
a
curious
way
at
that
time
there
lived
in
paris
about
the
year
a
man
whose
house
was
the
centre
of
gay
and
literary
people
those
who
did
not
like
the
stiffness
of
the
court
or
the
pedantries
of
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
his
name
was
scarron
a
popular
and
ribald
poet
a
comic
dramatist
a
buffoon
a
sort
of
rabelais
whose
inexhaustible
wit
was
the
admiration
of
the
city
he
belonged
to
a
good
family
and
originally
was
a
man
of
means
his
uncle
had
been
a
bishop
and
his
father
a
member
of
the
parliament
of
paris
but
he
had
wasted
his
substance
in
riotous
living
and
was
reduced
to
a
small
pension
from
the
government
his
profession
was
originally
that
of
a
priest
and
he
continued
through
life
to
wear
the
ecclesiastical
garb
he
was
full
of
maladies
and
miseries
and
his
only
relief
was
in
society
in
spite
of
his
poverty
he
contrived
to
give
suppers
they
would
now
be
called
dinners
which
were
exceedingly
attractive
to
his
house
came
the
noted
characters
of
the
day

even
ninon
de
all
bright
and
fashionable
people
whose
wit
and
raillery
were
the
admiration
of
the
city
it
so
happened
that
to
a
reception
of
the
abbé
scarron
was
brought
one
day
the
young
lady
destined
to
play
so
important
a
part
in
the
history
of
her
country
but
her
dress
was
too
short
which
so
mortified
her
in
the
splendid
circle
to
which
she
was
introduced
that
she
burst
into
tears
and
scarron
was
obliged
to
exert
all
his
tact
to
comfort
her
yet
she
made
a
good
impression
since
she
was
beautiful
and
witty
and
a
letter
which
she
wrote
to
a
friend
soon
after
which
letter
scarron
happened
to
see
was
so
remarkable
that
the
crippled
dramatist
determined
to
make
her
his
wife
she
only
sixteen
he
so
infirm
that
he
could
not
walk
and
so
poor
that
the
guests
frequently
furnished
the
dishes
for
the
common
entertainments
and
with
all
these
physical
defects
for
his
body
was
bent
nearly
double
and
notwithstanding
that
he
was
one
of
the
coarsest
and
profanest
men
of
that
ungodly
age
she
accepted
him
what
price
will
not
an
aspiring
woman
pay
for
social
position
for
even
a
marriage
with
scarron
was
to
her
a
step
in
the
ladder
of
social
elevation
did
she
love
this
bloated
and
crippled
sensualist
or
was
she
carried
away
by
admiration
of
his
brilliant
conversation
or
was
she
actuated
by
a
policy
i
look
upon
her
as
a
born
female
jesuit
believing
in
the
principle
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
nor
is
such
jesuitism
incompatible
with
pleasing

amiability
of

and
great

radiance
it
equally
marked
i
can
fancy
jezebel
cleopatra
and
catherine
de
médicis
moreover
in
france
it
has
long
been
the
custom
for
poor
girls
to
seek
eligible
matches
without
reference
to
love
it
does
not
seem
that
this
hideous
marriage
provoked
scandal
in
fact
it
made
the
fortune
of
mademoiselle
she
now
presided
at
entertainments
which
were
the
gossip
of
the
city
and
to
which
stupid
dukes
aspired
in
vain
for
scarron
would
never
have
a
dull
man
at
his
table
not
even
if
he
were
loaded
with
diamonds
and
could
trace
his
pedigree
to
the
paladins
of
charlemagne
but
by
presiding
at
parties
made
up
of
the
of
the
fashionable
and
cultivated
society
of
paris
this
ambitious
woman
became
acquainted
with
those
who
had
influence
at
court
so
that
when
her
husband
died
and
she
was
cut
off
from
his
and
reduced
to
poverty
she
was
recommended
to
madame
de
montespan
the
king
mistress
as
the
governess
of
her
children
it
was
a
judicious
appointment
madame
scarron
was
then
in
the
pride
of
womanly
grace
and
dignity
with
rare
intellectual
gifts
and
accomplishments
there
is
no
education
more
effective
than
that
acquired
by
constant
intercourse
with
learned
and
witty
people
even
the
is
no
bad
school
for
one
naturally
bright
and
amiable
there
is
more
to
be
learned
from
conversation
than
from
books
the
living
voice
is
a
great
educator
madame
scarron
on
the
death
of
her
husband
was
already
a
queen
of
society
as
the
governess
of
montespan
children
which
was
a
great
position
since
it
introduced
her
to
the
notice
of
the
king
himself
the
fountain
of
all
honor
and
promotion
her
habits
of
life
were
somewhat
changed
life
became
more
sombre
by
the
irksome
duties
of
educating
unruly
children
and
the
forced
retirement
to
which
she
was
necessarily
subjected
she
could
have
lived
without
this
preferment
since
the
pension
of
her
husband
was
restored
to
her
and
could
have
made
her
the
resort
of
the
best
society
but
she
had
deeper
designs
not
to
be
the
queen
of
a
fashionable
circle
did
she
now
aspire
but
to
be
the
leader
of
a
court
but
this
aim
she
was
obliged
to
hide
it
could
only
be
compassed
by
transcendent
tact
prudence
patience
and
good
sense
all
of
which
qualities
she
possessed
in
an
eminent
degree
it
was
necessary
to
gain
the
confidence
of
an
imperious
and
jealous
mistress
which
was
only
to
be
done
by
the
most
humble
assiduities
before
she
could
undermine
her
in
the
affections
of
the
king
she
had
also
to
gain
his
respect
and
admiration
without
allowing
any
improper
intimacy
she
had
to
disarm
jealousy
and
win
confidence
to
be
as
humble
in
address
as
she
was
elegant
in
manners
and
win
a
selfish
man
from
pleasure
by
the
richness
of
her
conversation
and
the
severity
of
her
own
morals
little
by
little
she
began
to
exercise
a
great
influence
over
the
mind
of
the
king
when
he
was
becoming
wearied
of
the
railleries
of
his
exacting
favorite
and
when
some
of
the
delusions
of
life
were
beginning
to
be
dispelled
he
then
found
great
solace
and
enjoyment
in
the
society
of
madame
scarron
whom
he
enriched
enabling
her
to
purchase
the
estate
of
maintenon
and
to
assume
its
name
she
soothed
his
temper
softened
his
resentments
and
directed
his
attention
to
a
new
field
of
thought
and
reflection
she
was
just
the
opposite
of
montespan
in
almost
everything
the
former
won
by
the
solid
attainments
of
the
mind
the
latter
by
her
sensual
charms
the
one
talked
on
literature
art
and
religious
subjects
the
other
on
fêtes
balls
reviews
and
the
glories
of
the
court
and
its
innumerable
scandals
maintenon
reminded
the
king
of
his
duties
without
sermonizing
or
moralizing
but
with
the
insidious
flattery
of
a
devout
worshipper
of
his
genius
and
power
montespan
directed
his
mind
to
pleasures
which
had
lost
their
charm
maintenon
was
always
amiable
and
sympathetic
montespan
provoked
the
king
by
her
resentments
her
imperious
exactions
her
ungovernable
fits
of
temper
her
haughty
sarcasm
maintenon
was
calm
modest
judicious
wise
montespan
was
passionate
extravagant
unreasonable
maintenon
always
appealed
to
the
higher
nature
of
the
king
montespan
to
the
lower
the
one
was
a
sincere
friend
dissuading
from
folly
the
other
an
exacting
lover
demanding
perpetually
new
favors
to
the
injury
of
the
kingdom
and
the
subversion
of
the
king
dignity
of
character
the
former
ruled
through
the
reason
the
latter
through
the
passions
maintenon
was
irreproachable
in
her
morals
preserved
her
and
tolerated
no
improper
advances
having
no
great
temptations
to
subdue
steadily
adhering
to
that
policy
which
she
knew
would
in
time
make
her
society
indispensable
montespan
was
content
to
be
simply
mistress
with
no
forecast
of
the
future
and
with
but
little
regard
to
the
interests
or
honor
of
her
lord
maintenon
became
more
attractive
every
day
from
the
variety
of
her
intellectual
gifts
and
her
unwearied
efforts
to
please
and
instruct
montespan
although
a
bright
woman
amidst
the
glories
of
a
dazzling
court
at
last
wearied
disgusted
and
repelled
and
yet
the
woman
who
gradually
supplanted
madame
de
montespan
by
superior
radiance
of
mind
and
soul
openly
remained
her
friend
through
all
her
waning
influence
and
pretended
to
come
to
her
rescue
the
friendship
of
the
king
for
madame
de
maintenon
began
as
early
as
and
during
the
twelve
years
she
was
the
governess
of
children
she
remained
discreet
and
dignified
i
dismiss
him
said
she
always
despairing
never
repulsed
what
a
transcendent
actress
what
astonishing
tact
what
shrewdness
blended
with
she
conformed
herself
to
his
tastes
and
notions
at
the
of
her
palsied
husband
she
had
been
gay
unstilted
and
simple
but
with
the
king
she
became
formal
prudish
ceremonious
fond
of
etiquette
and
pharisaical
in
her
religious
life
she
discreetly
ruled
her
royal
lover
in
the
name
of
virtue
and
piety
in
the
king
created
her
marquise
de
maintenon
on
the
disgrace
of
madame
de
montespan
when
the
king
was
madame
de
maintenon
still
remained
at
court
having
a
conspicuous
office
in
the
royal
household
as
mistress
of
the
robes
to
the
dauphiness
so
that
her
nearness
to
the
king
created
no
scandal
she
was
now
a
stately
woman
with
sparkling
black
eyes
a
fine
complexion
beautiful
teeth
and
exceedingly
graceful
manners
the
king
could
not
now
live
without
her
for
he
needed
a
counsellor
whom
he
could
trust
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
great
colbert
on
whose
shoulders
had
been
laid
the
burdens
of
the
monarchy
had
recently
died
on
the
death
of
the
queen
louis
made
madame
de
maintenon
his
wife
she
being
about
fifty
and
he
this
private
and
secret
marriage
was
never
openly
divulged
during
the
life
of
the
king
although
generally
surmised
this
placed
madame
de
maintenon
for
she
went
by
this
title
in
a
false
position
to
say
the
least
it
was
humiliating
amid
all
the
splendors
to
which
she
was
raised
for
if
she
were
a
lawful
wife
she
was
not
a
queen
some
perhaps
supposed
she
was
in
the
position
of
those
favorites
whose
fate
again
and
again
has
been
to
fall
one
thing
is
certain
the
king
would
have
made
her
his
mistress
years
before
but
to
this
she
would
never
consent
she
was
too
politic
too
ambitious
too
discreet
to
make
that
immense
mistake
yet
after
the
dismissal
of
montespan
she
seemed
to
be
such
until
she
had
with
transcendent
art
and
tact
attained
her
end
it
is
a
flaw
in
her
character
that
she
was
willing
so
long
to
be
aspersed
showing
that
power
was
dearer
to
her
than
reputation
bossuet
when
consulted
by
the
king
as
to
his
intended
marriage
approved
of
it
only
on
the
ground
that
it
was
better
to
make
a
foolish
marriage
than
violate
the
seventh
commandment
la
chaise
the
jesuit
confessor
who
travelled
in
a
coach
and
six
recommended
it
because
madame
de
maintenon
was
his
tool
but
louvois
felt
the
impropriety
as
well
as
fénelon
and
advised
the
king
not
thus
to
commit
himself
the
dauphin
was
furious
the
archbishop
of
paris
simply
did
his
duty
in
performing
the
ceremony
doubtless
reasons
of
state
imperatively
demanded
that
the
marriage
should
not
openly
be
proclaimed
and
still
more
that
the
widow
of
scarron
should
not
be
made
the
queen
of
france
louis
was
too
much
of
a
politician
and
too
proud
a
man
to
make
this
concession
had
he
raised
his
unacknowledged
wife
to
the
throne
it
would
have
resulted
in
political
complications
which
would
have
embarrassed
his
whole
subsequent
reign
he
dared
not
do
this
he
could
not
thus
scandalize
all
europe
and
defy
all
the
precedents
of
france
and
no
one
knew
this
better
than
madame
de
maintenon
herself
she
appeared
to
be
satisfied
if
she
could
henceforth
live
in
virtuous
relations
her
religious
scruples
are
to
be
respected
it
is
wonderful
that
she
gained
as
much
as
she
did
in
that
proud
cynical
and
worldly
court
and
from
the
proudest
monarch
in
the
world
but
louis
was
not
happy
without
her
a
proof
of
his
respect
and
love
at
the
age
of
he
needed
the
counsels
of
a
wife
amid
his
increasing
embarrassments
he
was
already
wearied
sickened
and
disgusted
he
now
wanted
repose
friendship
and
fidelity
he
certainly
was
guilty
of
no
error
in
marrying
one
of
the
most
gifted
women
of
his
kingdom
perhaps
the
most
accomplished
woman
of
the
age
interesting
and
even
beautiful
at
fifty
she
was
then
in
the
perfection
of
mental
and
moral
fascinations
he
made
no
other
sacrifice
than
of
his
pride
his
fidelity
to
his
wife
and
his
constant
devotion
to
her
until
he
died
proved
the
sincerity
and
depth
of
his
attachment
and
her
marvellous
influence
over
him
was
on
the
whole
good
with
the
exception
of
her
religious
intolerance
as
the
wife
of
louis
xiv
the
power
of
madame
de
maintenon
became
almost
unbounded
her
ambition
was
gratified
and
her
end
was
accomplished
she
was
the
dispenser
of
court
favors
the
arbiter
of
fortunes
the
real
ruler
of
the
land
her
reign
was
political
as
well
as
social
she
sat
in
the
cabinet
of
the
king
and
gave
her
opinions
on
state
matters
whenever
she
was
asked
her
counsels
were
so
wise
that
they
generally
prevailed
no
woman
before
or
after
her
ever
exerted
so
great
an
influence
on
the
fortunes
of
a
kingdom
as
did
the
widow
of
the
poet
scarron
the
court
which
she
adorned
and
ruled
was
not
so
brilliant
as
it
had
been
under
madame
de
montespan
but
was
still
magnificent
she
made
it
more
decorous
though
probably
more
dull
she
was
opposed
to
all
foolish
expenditures
she
discouraged
the
endless
fêtes
and
balls
and
masquerades
which
made
her
predecessor
so
popular
but
still
versailles

unparalleled

almost

and
all
these

were
filled

poured

to
reflect
the
splendors
of
an
absolute
throne
never
was
there
such
an
about
a
court
it
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
age
and
louis
never
lost
his
taste
for
this
outward
grandeur
he
was
ceremonious
and
exacting
to
the
end
he
never
lost
the
sense
of
his
own
omnipotence
in
his
latter
days
he
was
sad
and
dejected
but
never
exhibited
his
weakness
among
his
worshippers
he
was
always
dignified
and
he
loved
pomp
as
much
as
michael

loved

even
in
his
bitterest
reverses
he
still
maintained

air
of
the
grand
monarque

henri

etiquette
without
accepting
the
extravagant
restraints
which
the
court
of
france
endured
and
which
french
genius
would
not
support
assumed
an
unknown
extension
proportioned
to
the
increase
of
royal
splendor
it
was
adapted
to
serve
the
monarchy
at
the
expense
of
the
aristocracy
and
tended
to
make
functions
prevail
over
birth
the
great
dukes
and
peers
were
multiplied
in
order
to
reduce
their
importance
and
the
king
gave
the
marshals
precedence
over
them
the
court
was
a
scientific
and
complicated
machine
which
louis
guided
with
sovereign
skill
at
all
hours
in
all
places
in
the
most
trifling
circumstances
of
life
he
was
always
king
his
affability
never
contradicted
itself
he
expressed
interest
and
kindliness
to
all
he
showed
himself
indulgent
to
errors
that
could
not
be
repaired
his
majesty
was
tempered
by
a
grave
familiarity
and
he
wholly
refrained
from
those
pointed
and
ironical
speeches
which
so
cruelly
wound
when
falling
from
the
lips
of
a
man
that
none
can
answer
he
taught
all
by
his
example
the
most
exquisite
courtesy
to
women
manners
acquired
unequalled
elegance
the
fêtes
exceeded
everything
which
romance
had
dreamed
in
which
the
fairy
splendors
that
wearied
the
eye
were
blended
with
the
noblest
pleasures
of
the
intellect
but
whether
appearing
in
mythological
ballets
or
riding
in
tournaments
in
the
armor
of
the
heroes
of
antiquity
or
presiding
at
plays
and
banquets
in
his
ordinary
apparel
with
his
thick
flowing
hair
his
loose
surtout
blazing
with
gold
and
silver
and
his
profusion
of
ribbons
and
plumes
always
his
air
and
port
had
something
unique
always
he
was
the
first
among
all
his
whole
life
was
like
a
work
of
art
and
the
rôle
was
admirably
played
because
he
played
it
conscientiously
the
king
was
not
only
sacred
but
he
was
supposed
to
have
different
blood
in
his
veins
from
other
men
his
person
was
inviolable
he
reigned
it
was
universally
supposed
by
divine
right
he
was
a
divinely
commissioned
personage
like
saul
and
david
he
did
not
reign
because
he
was
able
or
powerful
or
wealthy
because
he
was
a
statesman
or
a
general
but
because
he
had
a
right
to
reign
which
no
one
disputed
this
adoration
of
royalty
was
not
only
universal
but
it
was
deeply
seated
in
the
minds
of
men
and
marked
strongly
all
the
courtiers
and
generals
and
bishops
and
poets
who
surrounded
the
throne
of
louis
bossuet
and
fénelon
as
well
as
colbert
and
louvois
racine
and
molière
as
well
as
condé
and
turenne
especially
the
nobility
of
the
realm
looked
up
to
the
king
as
the
source
and
centre
of
their
own
honors
and
privileges
even
the
people
were
proud
to
recognize
in
him
a
sort
of
divinity
and
all
persons
stood
in
the
presence
of
royalty
all
this
reverence
was
based
on
ideas
which
have
ever
moved
the
world
such
as
sustained
popes
in
the
middle
ages
and
emperors
in
ancient
borne
and
patriarchal
rule
among
early
oriental
peoples
religion
as
well
as
law
and
patriotism
invested
monarchs
with
this
sacred
and
inalienable
authority
never
greater
than
when
louis
xiv
began
to
reign
but
with
all
his
grandeur
louis
xiv
did
not
know
how
to
avail
himself
of
the
advantages
which
fortune
and
accident
placed
in
his
way
he
was
simply
magnificent
like
xerxes
like
a
man
who
had
entered
into
a
vast
inheritance
which
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
he
had
no
profound
views
of
statesmanship
like
augustus
or
tiberius
he
had
no
conception
of
what
the
true
greatness
of
a
country
consisted
in
hence
his
vast
treasures
were
spent
in
useless
wars
silly
pomps
and
inglorious
pleasures
his
grand
court
became
the
scene
of
cabals
and
rivalries
scandals
and
follies
his
wars
from
which
he
expected
glory
ended
only
in
shame
his
great
generals
passed
away
without
any
to
take
their
place
his
people
instead
of
being
enriched
by
a
development
of
national
resources
became
poor
and
discontented
while
his
persecutions
decimated
his
subjects
and
sowed
the
seeds
of
future
calamities
even
the
learned
men
who
shed
lustre
around
his
throne
prostituted
their
talents
to
nurse
his
egotism
and
did
but
little
to
elevate
the
national
character
neither
pascal
with
his
intense
hostility
to
spiritual
despotism
nor
racine
with
the
severe
taste
which
marked
the
classic
authors
of
greece
and
rome
nor
fénelon
with
his
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
clear
perception
of
the
moral
strength
of
empires
dared
to
give
full
scope
to
his
genius
but
all
were
obliged
to
veil
their
sentiments
in
vague
panegyrics
of
ancient
heroes
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
great
intellectual
lights
had
disappeared
under
the
withering
influences
of
despotism
as
in
ancient
rome
under
the
emperors
all
manly
independence
had
fled
and
literature
went
through
an
eclipse
that
absorbing
egotism
which
made
louis
xiv
jealous
of
the
fame
of
condé
and
luxembourg
or
fearful
of
the
talents
of
louvois
and
colbert
or
suspicious
of
the
influence
of
racine
and
fénelon
also
led
him
to
degrade
his
nobility
by
menial
offices
and
institute
in
his
court
a
burdensome
formality
in
spite
of
his
great
abilities
no
monarch
ever
reaped
a
severer
penalty
for
his
misgovernment
than
did
louis
like
solomon
he
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
bursting
of
all
the
bubbles
which
had
floated
before
his
intoxicated
brain
all
his
delusions
were
dispelled
he
was
oppressed
with
superstitious
fears
he
was
weary
of
the
very
pleasures
of
which
he
once
was
fondest
he
saw
before
him
a
gulf
of
national
disasters
he
was
obliged
to
melt
up
the
medallions
which
commemorated
his
victories
to
furnish
bread
for
starving
soldiers
he
lost
the
provinces
he
had
seized
he
saw
the
successive
defeat
of
all
his
marshals
and
the
annihilation
of
his
veteran
armies
he
was
deprived
of
his
children
and
grandchildren
by
the
most
dreadful
malady
known
to
that
generation
a
feeble
infant
was
the
heir
of
his
dominions
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
national
disgrace
he
found
no
counsellors
whom
he
could
trust
no
friends
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
his
sorrows
the
infirmities
of
age
oppressed
his
body
the
agonies
of
remorse
disturbed
his
soul
the
fear
of
hell
became
the
foundation
of
his
religion
for
he
must
have
felt
that
he
had
a
fearful
reckoning
with
the
king
of
kings
such
was
the
man
to
whom
the
best
days
of
madame
de
maintenon
were
devoted
and
she
shared
his
confidence
to
the
last
she
did
all
she
could
to
alleviate
his
sorrows
for
a
more
miserable
man
than
louis
xiv
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
never
was
seated
on
a
throne
well
might
his
wife
exclaim
save
those
who
occupy
the
highest
places
i
know
of
none
more
unhappy
than
those
who
envy
them
this
great
woman
attempted
to
make
her
husband
a
religious
man
and
succeeded
so
far
as
a
rigid
regard
to
formalities
and
technical
observances
can
make
a
man
religious
it
may
be
asked
how
this
formal
and
proper
woman
was
enabled
to
exert
upon
the
king
so
great
an
influence
for
she
was
the
real
ruler
of
the
land
no
woman
ever
ruled
with
more
absolute
sway
from
queen
esther
to
madame
de
pompadour
than
did
the
widow
of
the
profane
and
crippled
scarron
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
she
exerted
this
influence
by
mere
moral
and
intellectual
force
the
power
of
physical
beauty
retreating
before
the
superior
radiance
of
wisdom
and
virtue
la
vallière
had
wearied
and
montespan
had
disgusted
even
a
sensual
king
with
all
their
remarkable
attractions
but
maintenon
by
her
prudence
her
tact
her
wisdom
and
her
friendship
retained
the
empire
she
had
won
thus
teaching
the
immortal
lesson
that
nothing
but
respect
constitutes
a
sure
foundation
for
love
or
can
hold
the
heart
of
a
selfish
man
amid
the
changes
of
life
whatever
the
promises
made
emphatic
by
passion
whatever
the
presents
or
favors
given
as
tokens
of
everlasting
ties
whatever
the
raptures
consecrating
the
endearments
of
a
plighted
troth
whatever
the
admiration
called
out
by
the
scintillations
of
genius
whatever
the
gratitude
arising
from
benefits
bestowed
in
sympathy
all
will
vanish
in
the
heart
of
a
man
unless
confirmed
by
qualities
which
extort
esteem
the
most
impressive
truth
that
can
be
presented
to
the
mind
of
woman
her
encouragement
if
good
her
sentence
to
misery
if
bad
so
far
as
her
hopes
centre
around
an
earthly
idol
now
madame
de
maintenon
whatever
her
defects
her
pharisaism
her
cunning
her
ambition
and
her
narrow
religious
intolerance
was
still
it
would
seem
always
respected
not
only
by
the
king
himself
a
great
discerner
of
character
but
by
the
court
which
she
controlled
and
even
by
that
gay
circle
of
wits
who
met
around
the
of
her
first
husband
the
breath
of
scandal
never
tarnished
her
reputation
she
was
admired
by
priests
as
well
as
by
nobles
from
this
fact
which
is
well
attested
we
infer
that
she
acted
with
transcendent
discretion
as
the
governess
of
the
duke
of
maine
even
when
brought
into
the
most
intimate
relations
with
the
king
and
that
when
reigning
at
the
court
after
the
death
of
the
queen
she
must
have
been
supposed
to
have
a
right
to
all
the
attentions
which
she
received
from
louis
xiv
and
what
is
very
remarkable
about
this
woman
is
that
she
should
so
easily
have
supplanted
madame
de
montespan
in
the
full
blaze
of
her
dazzling
beauty
when
the
king
was
in
the
maturity
of
his
power
and
in
all
the
pride
of
external
circumstance
she
born
a
protestant
converted
to
catholicism
in
her
youth
under
protest
poor
dependent
a
governess
the
widow
of
a
vulgar
buffoon
and
with
antecedents
which
must
have
stung
to
the
quick
so
proud
a
man
as
was
louis
xiv
with
his
severe
taste
his
experience
his
discernment
with
all
the
cynical
and
hostile
influences
of
a
proud
and
worldly
court
and
after
a
long
and
searching
intimacy
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
he
could
have
loved
and
honored
her
to
his
death
if
she
had
not
been
worthy
of
his
esteem
and
when
we
remember
that
for
nearly
forty
years
she
escaped
the
scandals
which
made
those
times
unique
in
infamy
we
are
forced
to
concede
that
on
the
whole
she
must
have
been
a
good
woman
to
retain
such
unbounded
power
for
over
thirty
years
is
a
very
remarkable
thing
to
do
madame
de
maintenon
however
though
wise
and
virtuous
made
many
grave
mistakes
as
she
had
many
defects
of
character
great
as
she
was
she
has
to
answer
for
political
crimes
into
which
from
her
narrow
religious
prejudices
she
led
the
king
the
most
noticeable
feature
in
the
influence
which
madame
de
maintenon
exercised
on
the
king
was
in
inciting
a
spirit
of
religious
intolerance
and
this
appeared
even
long
before
madame
de
montespan
had
lost
her
ascendency
for
ten
years
before
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
there
had
been
continual
persecution
of
the
protestants
in
france
on
the
ground
that
they
were
heretics
though
not
rebels
and
the
same
persecuting
spirit
was
displayed
in
reference
to
the
jansenists
who
were
catholics
and
whose
only
sin
was
intellectual
boldness
anybody
who
thought
differently
from
the
monarch
incurred
the
royal
displeasure
intellectual
freedom
and
honesty
were
the
real
reasons
of
the
disgrace
of
racine
and
fénelon
for
the
king
was
a
bigot
in
religion
as
well
as
a
despot
on
a
throne
he
fancied
that
he
was
very
pious
he
was
regular
in
all
his
religious
duties
he
was
an
earnest
and
conscientious
adherent
to
all
the
doctrines
of
the
catholic
church
in
his
judgment
a
departure
from
those
doctrines
should
be
severely
punished
he
was
as
sincere
as
torquemada
or
alva
or
saint
dominic
his
wife
encouraged
this
bigotry
and
even
stimulated
his
resentments
toward
those
who
differed
from
him
at
last
in
the
fatal
blow
was
struck
which
decimated
the
subjects
of
an
irresponsible
king
the
glorious
edict
which
henry
iv
had
granted
and
which
even
richelieu
and
mazarin
had
respected
was
repealed
there
was
no
political
necessity
for
the
crime
it
sprang
from
unalloyed
religious
intolerance
and
it
was
as
suicidal
as
it
was
uncalled
for
and
cruel
it
was
an
immense
political
blunder
which
no
enlightened
monarch
would
ever
have
committed
and
which
none
but
a
cold
and
narrow
woman
would
ever
have
encouraged
there
was
no
excuse
or
palliation
for
this
abominable
persecution
any
more
than
there
was
for
the
burning
of
john
huss
it
had
not
even
as
much
to
justify
it
as
had
the
slaughter
of
bartholomew
for
the
huguenots
were
politically
hostile
and
dangerous
it
was
an
act
of
wanton
cruelty
incited
by
religious
bigotry
i
wonder
how
a
woman
so
so
intelligent
and
so
politic
as
madame
de
maintenon
doubtless
was
could
have
encouraged
the
king
to
a
measure
which
undermined
his
popularity
which
cut
the
sinews
of
natural
strength
and
raised
up
implacable
enemies
in
every
protestant
country
i
can
palliate
her
detestable
bigotry
only
on
the
ground
that
she
was
the
slave
of
an
order
of
men
who
have
ever
proved
themselves
to
be
the
inveterate
foes
of
human
freedom
and
who
marked
their
footsteps
wherever
they
went
by
a
trail
of
blood
louis
was
equally
their
blinded
tool
the
order
the
society
of
jesus
was
created
to
extirpate
heresy
and
in
this
instance
it
was
carried
out
to
the
bitter
end
the
persecution
of
the
protestants
under
louis
xiv
was
the
most
cruel
and
successful
of
all
known
persecutions
in
ancient
or
modern
times
it
annihilated
the
protestants
so
far
as
there
were
any
left
openly
to
defend
their
cause
it
drove
out
of
france
from
two
hundred
thousand
to
four
hundred
thousand
of
her
best
people
and
executed
or
confined
to
the
galleys
as
many
more
they
died
like
sheep
led
to
the
slaughter
they
died
not
with
arms
but
bibles
in
their
hands
i
have
already
presented
some
details
of
that
inglorious
persecution
in
my
lecture
on
louis
and
will
not
repeat
what
i
there
said
it
was
deemed
by
madame
de
maintenon
a
means
of
grace
to
the
king
for
in
her
way
she
always
sought
his
conversion
and
when
the
bloody
edict
went
forth
for
the
slaughter
of
the
best
people
in
the
land
she
wrote
that
the
king
was
now
beginning
to
think
seriously
of
his
salvation
if
god
preserve
him
there
will
be
no
longer
but
one
religion
in
the
kingdom
this
foul
stain
on
her
character
did
not
proceed
from
cruelty
of
disposition
but
from
mistaken
zeal
what
a
contrast
her
conduct
was
to
the
policy
of
elizabeth
yet
she
was
no
worse
than
le
tellier
la
chaise
and
other
fanatics
religious
intolerance
was
one
of
the
features
of
the
age
and
of
the
roman
catholic
church
but
religious
bigotry
is
eternally
odious
to
enlightened
reason
no
matter
how
interesting
a
man
or
woman
may
be
in
most
respects
if
stained
with
cruel
intolerance
in
religious
opinions
he
or
she
will
be
repulsive
it
left
an
indelible
stain
on
the
character
of
the
most
brilliant
and
gifted
woman
of
her
times
and
makes
us
forget
her
many
virtues
with
all
her
excellences
she
goes
down
in
history
as
a
cold
and
intolerant
woman
whom
we
can
not
love
we
can
not
forget
that
in
a
great
degree
through
her
influence
the
edict
of
nantes
was
repealed
the
persecution
of
the
protestants
however
partially
reveals
the
narrow
intolerance
of
madame
de
maintenon
she
sided
but
with
those
whose
influence
was
directed
to
the
support
of
the
recognized
dogmas
of
the
church
in
their
connection
with
the
absolute
rule
of
kings
the
interests
of
catholic
institutions
have
ever
been
identical
with
absolutism
bossuet
the
ablest
theologian
and
churchman
which
the
catholic
church
produced
in
the
seventeenth
century
gave
the
whole
force
of
his
vast
intellect
to
uphold
an
unlimited
royal
authority
he
saw
in
the
bold
philosophical
speculations
of
descartes
malebranche
spinoza
leibnitz
and
locke
an
insidious
undermining
of
the
doctrines
of
the
church
an
intellectual
freedom
whose
logical
result
would
be
fatal
alike
to
church
and
state
his
eagle
eye
penetrated
to
the
core
of
every
system
of
human
thought
he
saw
the
logical
and
necessary
results
of
every
theory
which
pantheists
or
rationalists
or
quietists
or
jansenists
advanced
whatever
did
not
support
the
dogmas
of
mediaeval
and
patriotic
theologians
such
as
the
papal
church
indorsed
was
regarded
by
him
with
suspicion
and
aversion
every
theory
or
speculation
which
tended
to
emancipate
the
mind
or
weaken
the
authority
of
the
church
or
undermine
an
absolute
throne
was
treated
by
him
with
dogmatic
intolerance
and
persistent
hatred
he
made
war
alike
on
the
philosophers
the
jansenists
and
the
quietists
whether
they
remained
in
the
ranks
of
the
church
or
not
it
was
the
dangerous
consequences
of
these
speculations
pushed
to
their
logical
result
which
he
feared
and
detested
and
which
no
other
eye
than
his
was
able
to
perceive
bossuet
communicated
his
spirit
to
madame
de
maintenon
and
to
the
king
who
were
both
under
his
influence
as
to
the
treatment
of
religious
or
philosophical
questions
louis
and
his
wife
were
both
devout
supporters
of
orthodoxy
that
is
the
received
doctrines
of
the
church
partly
from
conservative
tendencies
and
partly
from
the
connection
of
established
religious
institutions
with
absolutism
in
government
whatever
was
established
was
supported
because
it
was
established
they
would
suffer
no
innovation
not
even
in
philosophy
anything
progressive
was
abhorred
as
much
as
anything
destructive
when
fénelon
said
i
love
my
family
better
than
myself
my
country
better
than
my
family
and
the
human
race
better
than
my
country
he
gave
utterance
to
a
sentiment
which
was
revolutionary
in
its
tendency
when
he
declared
in
his
télémaque
what
were
the
duties
of
kings
that
they
reigned
for
the
benefit
of
their
subjects
rather
than
for
themselves
he
undermined
the
throne
which
he
openly
supported
it
was
the
liberal
spirit
which
animated
fénelon
as
well
as
the
innovations
to
which
his
opinions
logically
led
which
arrayed
against
him
the
king
who
admired
him
the
woman
who
had
supported
him
and
the
bishop
who
was
jealous
of
him
although
he
charmed
everybody
with
whom
he
associated
by
the
angelic
sweetness
of
his
disposition
his
refined
courtesies
of
manner
and
his
sparkling
but
inoffensive
wit
a
born
courtier
as
well
as
philosopher
the
most
interesting
and
accomplished
man
of
his
generation
still
neither
bossuet
nor
madame
de
maintenon
nor
the
king
could
tolerate
his
teachings
so
pregnant
were
they
with
innovations
and
he
was
exiled
to
his
bishopric
madame
de
maintenon
who
once
delighted
in
fénelon
learned
to
detest
him
as
much
as
bossuet
did
when
the
logical
tendency
of
his
writings
was
seen
she
would
rivet
the
chains
of
slavery
on
the
human
intellect
as
well
as
on
the
devotees
of
rome
or
the
courtiers
of
the
king
while
fénelon
would
have
emancipated
the
race
itself
in
the
fervor
and
sincerity
of
his
boundless
love
this
hostility
to
fénelon
was
not
caused
entirely
by
the
political
improvements
he
would
have
introduced
but
because
his
toleration
sought
to
protect
the
sentimental
pantheism
which
madame
guyon
inculcated
in
her
maxims
of
disinterested
love
and
voluntary
passivity
of
the
soul
towards
god
in
opposition
to
that
rationalistic
pantheism
which
spinoza
defended
and
into
which
he
had
inexorably
pushed
with
unexampled
logic
the
deductions
of
malebranche
the
men
who
finally
overturned
the
fabric
of
despotism
which
richelieu
constructed
were
the
philosophers
the
clear
but
narrow
intellect
of
the
king
and
his
wife
instinctively
saw
in
them
the
natural
enemies
of
the
throne
and
hence
they
were
frowned
upon
if
not
openly
persecuted
we
are
forced
therefore
to
admit
that
the
intolerance
of
madame
de
maintenon
repulsive
as
it
was
arose
in
part
like
the
intolerance
of
bossuet
from
zeal
to
uphold
the
institutions
and
opinions
on
which
the
church
and
the
throne
were
equally
based
the
jesuits
would
call
such
a
woman
a
nursing
mother
of
the
church
a
protector
of
the
cause
of
orthodoxy
the
watchful
guardian
of
the
royal
interests
and
those
of
all
established
institutions
any
logically
carried
out
would
land
any
person
on
the
ground
where
she
stood
but
while
madame
de
maintenon
was
a
foe
to
everything
like
heresy
or
opposition
to
the
catholic
church
or
true
intellectual
freedom
she
was
the
friend
of
education
she
was
the
founder
of
the
celebrated
school
of
cyr
where
three
hundred
young
ladies
daughters
of
impoverished
nobles
were
educated
gratuitously
she
ever
took
the
greatest
interest
in
this
school
and
devoted
to
it
all
the
time
her
numerous
engagements
would
permit
she
visited
it
every
day
and
was
really
its
president
and
director
there
was
never
a
better
school
for
aristocratic
girls
in
a
catholic
country
she
directed
their
studies
and
superintended
their
manners
and
brought
to
bear
on
their
culture
her
own
vast
experience
if
bossuet
was
a
born
priest
she
was
a
born
teacher
it
was
for
the
amusement
of
the
girls
that
racine
was
induced
by
her
to
write
one
of
his
best
dramas
queen
esther
a
sort
of
religious
tragedy
in
the
severest
taste
which
was
performed
by
the
girls
in
the
presence
of
the
most
distinguished
people
of
the
court
madame
de
maintenon
exerted
her
vast
influence
in
favor
of
morality
and
learning
she
rewarded
genius
and
scholarship
she
was
the
patron
of
those
distinguished
men
who
rendered
important
services
to
france
whether
statesmen
divines
generals
or
scholars
she
sought
to
bring
to
the
royal
notice
eminent
merit
in
every
department
of
life
within
the
ranks
of
orthodoxy
a
poet
or
painter
or
orator
who
gave
remarkable
promise
was
sure
of
her
kindness
and
there
were
many
such
for
the
world
is
full
at
all
times
of
remarkable
young
men
and
women
but
there
are
very
few
remarkable
men
at
the
age
of
fifty
and
her
influence
on
the
court
was
equally
good
she
discouraged
levities
gossip
and
dissipation
if
the
palace
was
not
so
gay
as
during
the
reign
of
madame
de
montespan
it
was
more
decorous
and
more
intellectual
it
became
fashionable
to
go
to
church
and
to
praise
good
sermons
and
read
books
of
casuistry
tartuffe
grew
pale
before
escobar
bossuet
and
bourdaloue
were
equal
oracles
with
molière
and
racine
great
preachers
were
all
the
fashion
the
court
became
very
decorous
if
it
was
hypocritical
the
king
interested
himself
in
theological
discussions
and
became
as
austere
as
formerly
he
was
gay
and
merry
he
regretted
his
wars
and
his
for
both
were
discouraged
by
madame
de
maintenon
who
perceived
that
they
impoverished
the
nation
she
undertook
the
mighty
task
of
reforming
the
court
itself
as
well
as
the
morals
of
the
king
and
she
partially
succeeded
the
proud
nebuchadnezzar
whom
she
served
was
at
last
made
to
confess
that
there
was
a
god
to
whom
he
was
personally
responsible
and
he
was
encouraged
to
bear
with
dignity
those
sad
reverses
which
humiliated
his
pride
and
drank
without
complaint
the
dregs
of
that
bitter
cup
which
retributive
justice
held
out
in
mercy
before
he
died
it
was
his
wife
who
revealed
the
deceitfulness
the
hypocrisy
the
treachery
and
the
heartlessness
of
that
generation
of
vipers
which
he
had
trusted
and
enriched
she
was
more
than
the
guardian
of
his
interests
she
was
his
faithful
friend
who
dissuaded
him
from
follies
so
that
outwardly
louis
xiv
became
a
religious
man
and
could
perhaps
have
preached
a
sermon
on
the
vanity
of
a
worldly
life
that
whatever
is
born
in
vanity
must
end
in
vanity
it
is
greatly
to
the
credit
of
madame
de
maintenon
that
she
was
interested
in
whatever
tended
to
improve
the
morals
of
the
people
or
to
develop
the
intellect
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
impressible
by
grand
sentiments
she
would
have
admired
madame
de
staël
or
madame
roland
not
their
opinions
but
their
characters
politics
was
perhaps
the
most
interesting
subject
to
her
as
it
has
ever
been
to
very
cultivated
women
in
france
and
it
was
with
the
details
of
cabinets
and
military
enterprises
that
she
was
most
familiar
it
was
this
political
knowledge
which
made
her
so
wise
a
counsellor
and
so
necessary
a
companion
to
the
king
but
her
reign
was
nevertheless
a
usurpation
she
triumphed
in
consequence
of
the
weakness
of
her
husband
more
than
by
her
own
strength
and
the
nation
never
forgave
her
she
outraged
the
honor
of
the
king
and
detracted
from
the
dignity
of
the
royal
station
louis
xiv
certainly
had
the
moral
right
to
marry
her
as
a
nobleman
may
espouse
a
but
it
was
a
which
the
proud
idolaters
of
rank
could
not
excuse
and
for
this
usurpation
madame
de
maintenon
paid
no
inconsiderable
a
penalty
she
was
insulted
by
the
royal
family
to
the
day
of
her
death
the
dauphin
would
not
visit
her
even
when
the
king
led
him
to
the
door
of
her
apartments
the
courtiers
mocked
her
behind
her
back
her
rivals
thrust
upon
her
their
envenomed
libels
even
racine
once
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
allude
in
her
presence
to
the
miserable
farces
of
the
poet
scarron
an
unpremeditated
and
careless
insult
which
she
never
forgot
or
forgave
moreover
in
all
her
grandeur
she
was
doomed
to
the
most
exhaustive
formalities
and
duties
for
the
king
exacted
her
constant
services
which
wearied
and
disgusted
her
she
was
born
for
freedom
but
was
really
a
slave
although
she
wore
gilded
fetters
she
was
not
what
one
would
call
an
unhappy
or
disappointed
woman
since
she
attained
the
end
to
which
she
had
aspired
but
she
could
not
escape
humiliations
she
was
in
a
false
position
her
reputation
was
aspersed
she
was
only
a
wife
whose
marriage
was
concealed
she
was
not
a
queen
all
she
gained
she
extorted
in
rising
to
the
exalted
height
of
ruling
the
court
of
france
she
yet
abdicated
her
throne
as
an
untrammelled
queen
of
society
and
became
the
slave
of
a
pompous
ceremonious
egotistical
selfish
peevish
tyrannical
exacting
disenchanted
old
voluptuary
and
when
he
died
she
was
treated
as
a
usurper
rather
than
a
wife
and
was
obliged
to
leave
the
palace
where
she
would
have
been
insulted
and
take
up
her
quarters
in
the
convent
she
had
founded
the
king
did
not
leave
her
by
his
will
a
large
fortune
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
curtail
her
charities
madame
de
maintenon
lived
to
be
and
retained
her
intellectual
faculties
to
the
last
retiring
to
the
abbey
of
cyr
on
the
death
of
the
king
in
and
surviving
him
but
four
years
she
was
beloved
and
honored
by
those
who
knew
her
intimately
she
was
the
idol
of
the
girls
of
cyr
who
worshipped
the
ground
on
which
she
trod
yet
she
made
no
mark
in
history
after
the
death
of
louis
xiv
all
her
greatness
was
but
the
reflection
of
his
glory
her
life
successful
as
it
was
is
but
a
confirmation
of
the
folly
of
seeking
a
position
which
is
not
legitimate
no
position
is
truly
desirable
which
is
a
false
one
which
can
be
retained
only
by
art
and
which
subjects
one
to
humiliation
and
mortifications
i
have
great
admiration
for
the
many
excellent
qualities
of
this
extraordinary
and
gifted
woman
although
i
know
that
she
is
not
a
favorite
with
historians
she
is
not
endeared
to
the
heart
of
the
nation
she
indirectly
ruled
she
is
positively
disliked
by
a
large
class
not
merely
for
her
narrow
religious
intolerance
but
even
for
the
arts
by
which
she
gained
so
great
an
influence
yet
liked
or
disliked
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
in
french
history
a
greater
or
more
successful

sarah
duchess
of
marlborough
the
woman
of
the
world
in
the
career
of
madame
de
maintenon
we
have
seen
in
a
woman
an
inordinate
ambition
to
rise
in
the
world
and
control
public
affairs
in
the
history
of
the
duchess
of
marlborough
we
see
the
same
ambition
the
same
love
of
power
the
same
unscrupulous
adaptation
of
means
to
an
end
yet
the
aim
and
ends
of
these
two
remarkable
political
women
were
different
the
frenchwoman
had
in
view
the
reform
of
a
wicked
court
the
interests
of
education
the
extirpation
of
heresy
the
elevation
of
men
of
genius
the
social
and
religious
improvement
of
a
great
nation
as
she
viewed
it
through
a
man
who
bore
absolute
sway
the
englishwoman
connived
at
political
corruptions
was
indifferent
to
learning
and
genius
and
exerted
her
great
influence
not
for
the
good
of
her
country
but
to
advance
the
fortunes
of
her
family
madame
de
maintenon
if
narrow
and
intolerant
was
unselfish
charitable
religious
and
patriotic
the
duchess
of
marlborough
was
selfish
grasping
avaricious
and
worldly
in
all
her
aspirations
both
were
ambitious
the
one
to
benefit
the
country
which
she
virtually
ruled
and
the
other
to
accumulate
honors
and
riches
by
cabals
and
intrigues
in
the
court
of
a
weak
woman
whom
she
served
and
despised
madame
de
maintenon
in
a
greater
position
as
the
wife
of
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
christendom
was
gentle
amiable
condescending
and
the
duchess
of
marlborough
was
haughty
insolent
and
acrimonious
both
were
beautiful
bright
witty
and
intellectual
but
the
frenchwoman
was
immeasurably
more
cultivated
and
was
impressible
by
grand
sentiments
and
yet
the
duchess
of
marlborough
was
a
great
woman
she
was
the
most
prominent
figure
in
the
court
of
queen
anne
and
had
a
vast
influence
on
the
politics
of
her
day
her
name
is
associated
with
great
statesmen
and
generals
she
occupied
the
highest
social
position
of
any
woman
in
england
after
that
of
the
royal
family
she
had
the
ear
and
the
confidence
of
the
queen
the
greatest
offices
were
virtually
at
her
disposal
around
her
we
may
cluster
the
leading
characters
and
events
of
the
age
of
queen
anne
sarah
jennings
the
future
duchess
of
marlborough
was
born
in
she
belonged
to
a
good
though
not
a
noble
family
which
for
many
generations
possessed
a
good
estate
in
hertfordshire
her
grandfather
sir
john
jennings
was
a
zealous
adherent
to
the
royal
cause
before
the
revolution
and
received
the
order
of
the
bath
in
company
with
his
patron
charles
then
prince
of
wales
when
sarah
was
twelve
years
of
age
she
found
a
kind
friend
in
the
duchess
of
york
mary
beatrice
eleanora
princess
of
modena
an
adopted
daughter
of
louis
xiv
who
married
james
brother
of
charles
ii
the
young
girl
was
thus
introduced
to
the
dangerous
circle
which
surrounded
the
duke
of
york
and
she
passed
her
time
not
in
profitable
studies
but
in
amusements
and
revels
she
lived
in
the
ducal
household
as
a
playmate
of
the
princess
anne
and
was
a
beautiful
bright
and
witty
young
lady
though
not
well
educated
in
the
year
she
became
acquainted
with
john
churchill
a
colonel
of
the
army
and
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
to
the
duke
of
york
the
latter
a
post
of
honor
but
of
small
emolument
he
was
at
that
time
years
of
age
a
and
gallant
soldier
who
had
already
distinguished
himself
at
the
siege
of
tangier
he
had
also
fought
under
the
banners
of
marshal
turenne
in
the
low
countries
by
whom
he
was
called
the
handsome
englishman
at
the
siege
of
maestricht
he
further
advanced
his
fortunes
succeeding
the
famous
earl
of
peterborough
in
the
command
of
the
english
troops
then
in
alliance
with
louis
xiv
he
was
not
a
man
of
intellectual
culture
nor
was
he
deeply
read
it
is
said
that
even
his
spelling
was
bad
but
his
letters
were
clear
and
forcible
he
made
up
his
deficiency
in
education
by
irresistibly
pleasing
manners
remarkable
energy
and
a
coolness
of
judgment
that
was
seldom
known
to
err
his
acquaintance
with
the
beautiful
sarah
jennings
soon
ripened
into
love
but
he
was
too
poor
to
marry
nor
had
she
a
fortune
they
however
became
engaged
to
each
other
and
the
betrothal
continued
three
years
it
was
not
till
that
the
marriage
took
place
the
colonel
was
domestic
in
his
tastes
and
amiable
in
his
temper
and
his
home
was
happy
he
was
always
fond
of
his
wife
although
her
temper
was
quick
and
her
habits
exacting
she
was
proud
irascible
and
overbearing
while
he
was
meek
and
gentle
in
other
respects
they
were
equally
matched
since
both
were
greedy
ambitious
and
worldly
a
great
stain
too
rested
on
his
character
for
he
had
been
scandalously
intimate
with
barbara
villiers
mistress
of
charles
who
gave
him
with
which
he
bought
an
annuity
of
a
year
thus
enabling
him
to
marry
miss
jennings
in
charles
ii
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
the
duke
of
york
as
james
ii
the
new
king
rewarded
his
favorite
colonel
churchill
with
a
scotch
peerage
and
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
guards
james
two
daughters
the
princesses
mary
and
anne
now
became
great
personages
but
from
mutual
jealousy
they
did
not
live
together
very
harmoniously
mary
the
elder
daughter
was
much
the
superior
of
her
sister
and
her
marriage
with
william
of
orange
was
particularly
happy
the
princess
anne
was
weak
and
far
from
being
interesting
but
she
was
inordinately
attached
to
lady
churchill
who
held
a
high
post
of
honor
and
emolument
in
her
household
it
does
not
appear
that
the
attachment
was
mutual
between
these
two
ladies
but
the
forms
of
it
were
kept
up
by
lady
churchill
who
had
ambitious
ends
to
gain
she
gradually
acquired
an
absolute
ascendency
over
the
mind
of
the
princess
who
could
not
live
happily
without
her
companionship
and
services
lady
churchill
was
at
this
time
remarkably
striking
in
her
appearance
with
a
clear
complexion
regular
features
majestic
figure
and
beautiful
hair
which
was
dressed
without
powder
she
also
had
great
power
of
conversation
was
frank
outspoken
and
amusing
but
without
much
tact
the
princess
wrote
to
her
sometimes
four
times
a
day
always
in
the
strain
of
humility
and
seemed
utterly
dependent
upon
her
anne
was
averse
to
reading
spending
her
time
at
cards
and
frivolous
pleasures
she
was
fond
of
etiquette
and
exacting
in
trifles
she
was
praised
for
her
piety
which
would
appear
however
to
have
been
formal
and
technical
she
was
placid
phlegmatic
and
had
no
conversational
gifts
she
played
tolerably
on
the
guitar
loved
the
chase
and
rode
with
the
hounds
until
disabled
by
the
gout
which
was
brought
about
by
the
pleasures
of
the
table
in
she
married
prince
george
of
denmark
and
by
him
had
thirteen
children
not
one
of
whom
survived
her
most
of
them
died
in
infancy
as
the
daughter
of
james
she
was
of
course
a
tory
in
her
political
opinions
lady
churchill
was
also
at
that
time
a
moderate
tory
and
fanned
the
prejudices
of
her
mistress
but
in
order
to
secure
a
still
greater
intimacy
and
freedom
than
was
consistent
with
their
difference
in
rank
the
two
ladies
assumed
the
names
of
morley
and
freeman
in
the
correspondence
between
them
the
character
of
the
princess
appears
to
the
greater
advantage
since
she
was
at
least
sincere
in
her
admiration
and
friendship
she
assumes
no
superiority
in
any
respect
in
her
intellectual
dependence
she
is
even
humble
anne
was
seemingly
disinterested
in
her
friendship
with
lady
churchill
having
nothing
to
gain
but
services
for
which
she
liberally
compensated
her
but
the
society
of
a
weak
woman
could
not
have
had
much
fascination
for
so
independent
and
a
person
as
was
the
proud
peeress
it
eventually
became
irksome
to
her
but
there
was
no
outward
flaw
in
the
friendship
until
anne
ascended
the
throne
in
not
even
for
several
years
after
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
in
changed
the
position
of
anne
to
whom
the
nation
now
looked
as
a
probable
future
queen
she
was
at
that
time
severely
censured
for
her
desertion
of
her
father
james
and
her
conduct
seemed
both
heartless
and
frivolous
but
she
was
virtually
in
the
hands
of
an
unscrupulous
woman
and
the
great
ministers
of
state
on
the
flight
of
the
king
james
the
princess
anne
retired
to
chatsworth
the
magnificent
seat
of
the
earl
of
devonshire
accompanied
by
lady
churchill
her
inseparable
companion
two
days
before
the
coronation
of
william
and
mary
lord
churchill
was
created
earl
of
marlborough
and
was
sworn
a
member
of
the
privy
council
and
a
lord
of
the
bedchamber
this
elevation
was
owing
to
his
military
talents
which
no
one
appreciated
better
than
the
king
who
however
never
personally
liked
marlborough
and
still
less
his
ambitious
wife
he
was
no
stranger
to
their
boundless
cupidity
though
he
pretended
not
to
see
it
he
was
politic
not
being
in
a
position
to
dispense
with
the
services
of
the
ablest
military
general
of
his
realm
william
iii
was
a
remarkably
wise
and
clearheaded
prince
and
saw
the
dangers
which
menaced
him
the
hostility
of
louis
the
rebels
in
ireland
and
the
disaffection
among
the
jacobite
nobility
in
england
who
secretly
favored
the
exiled
monarch
so
he
rewarded
and
elevated
a
man
whom
he
both
admired
and
despised
william
had
many
sterling
virtues
he
was
sincere
and
patriotic
and
he
was
a
stanch
protestant
of
the
calvinistic
school
and
very
attentive
to
his
religious
duties
but
with
all
his
virtues
and
services
to
the
english
nation
he
was
not
a
favorite
his
reserve
coldness
and
cynicism
were
in
striking
contrast
with
the
affability
of
the
stuarts
he
had
no
imagination
and
no
graces
he
disgusted
the
english
nobles
by
drinking
holland
gin
and
by
his
brusque
manners
but
nothing
escaped
his
eagle
eye
on
the
field
of
battle
he
was
as
ardent
and
fiery
as
he
was
dull
and
phlegmatic
at
hampton
court
his
favorite
residence
he
was
capable
of
warm
friendships
uninteresting
as
he
seemed
to
the
english
nobles
but
he
was
intimate
only
with
his
dutch
favorites
like
bentinck
and
keppel
whom
he
elevated
to
english
peerages
he
spent
only
a
few
months
in
england
each
year
of
the
thirteen
of
his
reign
being
absorbed
in
war
most
of
the
time
with
louis
xiv
and
the
irish
rebels
william
found
that
his
english
throne
was
anything
but
a
bed
of
roses
the
tories
in
the
tumults
and
dangers
attending
the
flight
of
james
had
promoted
his
elevation
but
they
were
secretly
hostile
and
when
dangers
had
passed
broke
out
in
factious
opposition
the
clergy
disliked
a
calvinistic
king
in
sympathy
with
dissenters
the
irish
gave
great
trouble
under
tyrconnel
and
old
marshal
schomberg
the
latter
of
whom
was
killed
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne
a
large
party
was
always
in
opposition
to
the
unceasing
war
with
louis
whom
william
hated
with
implacable
animosity
the
earl
of
marlborough
on
the
accession
of
william
was
a
moderate
tory
and
was
soon
suspected
of
not
being
true
to
his
sovereign
his
treason
might
have
resulted
in
the
return
of
the
stuarts
but
for
the
energy
and
sagacity
of
queen
mary
in
whose
hands
the
supreme
executive
power
was
placed
by
william
when
absent
from
the
kingdom
she
summoned
at
once
the
parliament
prevented
the
defection
of
the
navy
and
ferreted
out
the
hostile
intrigues
in
which
the
godolphin
was
also
implicated
but
for
the
fortunate
naval
victory
of
la
hogue
over
the
french
fleet
which
established
the
naval
supremacy
of
england
the
throne
of
william
and
the
protestant
succession
would
have
been
seriously
endangered
for
william
was
unfortunate
in
his
flemish
campaigns
when
the
king
was
apprised
of
the
treasonable
intrigues
which
endangered
his
throne
he
magnanimously
pardoned
godolphin
and
the
duke
of
shrewsbury
but
sent
marlborough
to
the
tower
although
he
soon
after
released
him
when
it
was
found
that
several
of
the
letters
which
compromised
him
had
been
forged
for
some
time
marlborough
lived
in
comparative
retirement
while
his
wife
devoted
herself
to
politics
and
her
duties
about
the
person
of
the
princess
anne
who
was
treated
very
coldly
by
her
sister
the
queen
and
was
even
deprived
of
her
guards
but
the
bickerings
and
quarrels
of
the
royal
sisters
were
suddenly
ended
by
the
death
of
mary
from
the
which
then
fearfully
raged
in
london
the
grief
of
the
king
was
sincere
and
excessive
as
well
as
that
of
the
nation
and
his
affliction
softened
his
character
and
mitigated
his
asperity
against
marlborough
shortly
after
the
death
of
his
queen
william
made
marlborough
governor
of
the
duke
of
gloucester
then
a
very
promising
prince
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
age
this
prince
only
surviving
son
of
anne
had
a
feeble
body
and
was
unwisely
crammed
by
bishop
burnet
his
preceptor
and
overworked
by
marlborough
who
taught
him
military
tactics
neither
his
body
nor
his
mind
could
stand
the
strain
made
upon
him
and
he
was
carried
off
at
the
age
of
eleven
by
a
fever
the
untimely
death
of
the
prince
was
a
great
disappointment
to
the
nation
and
cast
a
gloom
over
the
remaining
years
of
the
reign
of
william
who
from
this
time
declined
in
health
and
spirits
one
of
his
last
acts
was
to
appoint
the
earl
of
marlborough
general
of
the
troops
in
flanders
knowing
that
he
was
the
only
man
who
could
successfully
oppose
the
marshals
of
france
only
five
days
before
his
death
the
king
sent
a
recommendation
to
parliament
for
the
union
of
scotland
and
england
and
the
last
act
of
parliament
to
which
he
gave
his
consent
was
that
which
fixed
the
succession
in
the
house
of
hanover
at
the
age
of
while
planning
the
campaign
which
was
to
make
marlborough
immortal
william
received
his
which
was
accidental
he
was
riding
in
the
park
of
hampton
court
when
his
horse
stumbled
and
he
was
thrown
dislocating
his
the
bone
was
set
and
might
have
united
but
for
the
imprudence
of
the
king
who
insisted
on
going
to
kensington
on
important
business
fever
set
in
and
in
a
few
days
this
noble
and
heroic
king
died
march
the
greatest
of
the
english
kings
since
the
wars
of
the
roses
to
whom
the
english
nation
owed
the
peaceful
settlement
of
the
kingdom
in
times
of
treason
and
rebellion
the
princess
anne
at
the
age
of
quietly
ascended
the
throne
and
all
eyes
were
at
once
turned
to
marlborough
on
whom
the
weight
of
public
affairs
rested
he
was
now
active
wise
well
poised
experienced
and
generally
popular
in
spite
of
his
ambition
and
treason
he
had
as
we
have
already
remarked
been
a
moderate
tory
but
as
he
was
the
advocate
of
war
measures
he
now
became
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
whig
party
indeed
he
was
at
this
time
the
foremost
man
in
england
on
account
of
his
great
talents
as
a
statesman
and
diplomatist
as
well
as
general
and
for
the
ascendency
of
his
wife
over
the
mind
of
the
queen
next
to
him
in
power
was
the
godolphin
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
ties
of
friendship
family
alliance
and
political
principles
like
marlborough
godolphin
had
in
early
life
been
attached
to
the
service
of
the
house
of
stuart
he
had
been
page
to
charles
and
lord
chamberlain
to
mary
of
modena
the
princess
anne
when
a
young
lady
became
attached
to
this
amiable
and
witty
man
and
would
have
married
him
if
reasons
of
state
had
not
prevented
after
the
revolution
of
his
merits
were
so
conspicuous
that
he
was
retained
in
the
service
of
william
and
mary
and
raised
to
the
peerage
in
sound
judgment
extraordinary
sagacity
untiring
industry
and
unimpeached
integrity
he
resembled
lord
burleigh
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
and
like
him
rendered
great
public
services
grave
economical
cautious
upright
courteous
in
manners
he
was
just
the
man
for
the
stormy
times
in
which
he
lived
he
had
his
faults
being
fond
of
play
the
passion
of
that
age
and
of
women
says
swift
who
libelled
him
as
he
did
every
prominent
man
of
the
whig
party
he
could
scratch
out
a
song
in
praise
of
his
mistress
with
a
pencil
on
a
card
or
overflow
with
tears
like
a
woman
when
he
had
an
object
to
gain
but
the
real
ruler
of
the
land
on
the
accession
of
anne
was
the
favored
wife
of
marlborough
if
ever
a
subject
stood
on
the
very
pinnacle
of
greatness
it
was
she
all
the
foreign
ambassadors
flattered
her
and
paid
court
to
her
the
greatest
nobles
solicited
or
bought
of
her
the
lucrative
offices
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
she
was
the
dispenser
of
court
favors
as
mesdames
de
maintenon
and
pompadour
were
in
france
she
was
the
admiration
of
gifted
circles
in
which
she
reigned
as
a
queen
of
society
poets
sang
her
praises
and
extolled
her
beauty
statesmen
craved
her
influence
nothing
took
place
at
court
to
which
she
was
not
privy
she
was
the
mainspring
of
all
political
cabals
and
intrigues
even
the
queen
treated
her
with
deference
as
well
as
loaded
her
with
gifts
and
godolphin
consulted
her
on
affairs
of
state
the
military
fame
of
her
husband
gave
her
unbounded
no
englishwoman
ever
had
such
an
exalted
social
position
she
reigned
in
as
well
as
in
the
closet
of
the
queen
and
she
succeeded
in
marrying
her
daughters
to
the
proudest
peers
her
eldest
daughter
henrietta
was
the
wife
of
an
earl
and
prime
minister
her
second
daughter
anne
married
lord
charles
spencer
the
only
son
of
the
earl
of
sunderland
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
whig
party
and
secretary
of
state
her
third
daughter
became
the
wife
of
the
earl
afterwards
duke
of
bridgewater
and
the
fourth
and
youngest
daughter
had
for
her
husband
the
celebrated
duke
of
montague
of
the
order
of
the
bath
thus
did
sarah
jennings
rise
her
daughters
were
married
to
great
nobles
and
statesmen
her
husband
was
the
most
famous
general
of
his
age
and
she
herself
was
the
favorite
and
confidential
friend
and
adviser
of
the
queen
upon
her
were
showered
riches
and
honor
she
had
both
influence
and
power
influence
from
her
talents
and
power
from
her
position
and
when
she
became
duchess
after
the
great
victory
of
blenheim
and
a
princess
of
the
german
empire
she
had
nothing
more
to
aspire
to
in
the
way
of
fortune
or
favor
or
rank
she
was
the
first
woman
of
the
land
next
to
the
queen
whom
she
ruled
while
nominally
serving
her
there
are
very
few
people
in
this
world
whether
men
or
women
who
remain
unchanged
under
the
influence
of
boundless
prosperity
so
rare
are
the
exceptions
that
the
rule
is
established
wealth
honor
and
power
will
produce
luxury
pride
and
selfishness
how
few
can
hope
to
be
superior
to
solomon
mohammed
constantine
theodosius
louis
madame
de
maintenon
queen
elizabeth
maria
theresa
or
napoleon
in
that
sublime
which
looks
down
on
the
temptations
of
earth
with
the
placid
indifference
of
a
marcus
aurelius
even
prosperous
people
in
comparatively
humble
life
generally
become
arrogant
and
opinionated
and
like
to
have
things
in
their
own
way
now
lady
marlborough
was
both
proud
by
nature
and
the
force
of
circumstances
she
became
an
incarnation
of
arrogance
which
she
could
not
conceal
and
which
she
never
sought
to
control
when
she
became
the
central
figure
in
the
court
and
in
the
state
flattered
and
sought
after
wherever
she
went
before
whom
the
greatest
nobles
burned
their
incense
and
whom
the
people
almost
worshipped
in
a
country
which
has
ever
idolized
rank
and
power
she
assumed
airs
and
gave
vent
to
expressions
that
wounded
her
friend
the
queen
anne
bore
her
friend
intolerable
pride
blended
with
disdain
for
a
long
time
after
her
accession
but
her
own
character
also
began
to
change
sovereigns
do
not
like
dictation
from
subjects
however
powerful
and
when
securely
seated
on
her
throne
anne
began
to
avow
opinions
which
she
had
once
found
it
politic
to
conceal
she
soon
became
as
jealous
of
her
prerogative
as
her
uncle
charles
and
her
father
james
had
been
of
theirs
she
was
at
heart
a
tory
as
was
natural
and
attached
to
the
interests
of
her
banished
relatives
she
looked
upon
the
whigs
as
hostile
to
what
she
held
dear
she
began
to
dislike
ministers
who
had
been
in
high
favor
with
the
late
king
especially
lord
chancellor
somers
and
charles
montague
earl
of
halifax
since
these
powerful
nobles
allied
with
godolphin
and
marlborough
ruled
england
thus
the
political
opinions
of
the
queen
came
gradually
to
be
at
variance
with
those
advanced
by
her
favorite
whose
daughters
were
married
to
great
whig
nobles
and
whose
husband
was
bent
on
continuing
the
war
against
louis
xiv
and
the
exiled
stuarts
but
as
we
have
said
anne
for
a
long
time
suppressed
her
feelings
of
incipient
alienation
produced
by
the
politics
and
haughty
demeanor
of
her
favorite
and
still
wrote
to
her
as
her
beloved
freeman
and
signed
her
letters
as
usual
as
her
humble
morley
her
treatment
of
the
countess
continued
the
same
as
ever
full
of
affection
and
confidence
she
could
not
break
with
a
friend
who
had
so
long
been
indispensable
to
her
nor
had
she
strength
of
character
to
reveal
her
true
feelings
meanwhile
a
renewed
war
was
declared
against
louis
xiv
on
account
of
his
determination
to
place
his
grandson
on
the
throne
of
spain
the
tories
were
bitterly
opposed
to
this
war
of
the
spanish
succession
as
unnecessary
expensive
and
ruinous
to
the
development
of
national
industry
they
were
also
jealous
of
marlborough
whose
power
they
feared
would
be
augmented
by
the
war
as
the
of
the
united
dutch
and
english
forces
and
the
result
was
indeed
what
they
feared
his
military
successes
were
so
great
in
this
war
that
on
his
return
to
england
he
was
created
a
duke
and
soon
after
received
unusual
grants
from
parliament
controlled
by
the
whigs
which
made
him
the
richest
man
in
england
as
well
as
the
most
powerful
politically
yet
even
up
to
this
time
the
relations
between
his
wife
and
the
queen
were
apparently
most
friendly
but
soon
after
this
the
haughty
favorite
became
imprudent
in
the
expressions
she
used
before
her
royal
mistress
she
began
to
weary
of
the
drudgeries
of
her
office
as
mistress
of
the
robes
and
turned
over
her
duties
partially
to
a
who
was
destined
ultimately
to
supplant
her
in
the
royal
favor
the
queen
was
wounded
to
the
quick
by
some
things
that
the
duchess
said
and
did
which
she
was
supposed
not
to
hear
or
see
for
the
duchess
was
now
occasionally
careless
as
well
as
insolent
the
queen
was
forced
to
perceive
that
the
duchess
disdained
her
feeble
intellect
and
some
of
her
personal
habits
and
was
moreover
hostile
to
her
political
opinions
and
she
began
to
long
for
an
independence
she
had
never
truly
enjoyed
but
the
duchess
intoxicated
with
power
and
success
did
not
see
the
ground
on
which
she
stood
yet
if
she
continued
to
rule
her
mistress
it
was
by
fear
rather
than
love
about
this
period
the
struggles
and
hostilities
of
the
whigs
and
tories
were
at
their
height
we
have
in
these
times
but
a
feeble
conception
of
the
bitterness
of
the
strife
of
these
two
great
parties
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
divided
families
and
filled
the
land
with
slanders
and
intrigues
the
leaders
of
both
parties
were
equally
aristocratic
and
equally
opposed
to
reform
both
held
the
people
in
sovereign
contempt
the
struggle
between
them
was
simply
a
struggle
for
place
and
emolument
the
only
real
difference
in
their
principles
was
that
one
party
was
secretly
in
favor
of
the
exiled
family
and
was
opposed
to
the
french
war
and
the
other
was
more
jealously
protestant
and
was
in
favor
of
the
continuance
of
the
war
the
tories
accused
marlborough
of
needlessly
prolonging
the
war
in
order
to
advance
his
personal
interests
from
which
charge
it
would
be
difficult
to
acquit
him
one
of
the
most
prominent
leaders
of
the
tories
was
harley
afterwards
earl
of
oxford
who
belonged
to
a
puritan
family
in
hertfordshire
and
was
originally
a
whig
he
entered
parliament
in
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
william
macaulay
who
could
see
no
good
in
the
tories
in
his
violent
political
prejudices
maintained
that
harley
was
not
a
man
of
great
breadth
of
intellect
and
exerted
an
influence
in
parliament
disproportionate
to
his
abilities
but
he
was
a
most
insidious
and
effective
enemy
he
was
sagacious
enough
to
perceive
the
growing
influence
of
men
of
letters
and
became
their
patron
and
friend
he
advanced
the
fortunes
of
pope
arbuthnot
and
prior
he
purchased
the
services
of
swift
the
greatest
master
of
satire
blended
with
bitter
invective
that
england
had
known
harley
was
not
eloquent
in
speech
but
he
was
industrious
learned
exact
and
was
always
listened
to
with
respect
nor
had
he
any
scandalous
vices
he
could
not
be
corrupted
by
money
and
his
private
life
was
decorous
he
abhorred
both
gambling
and
drunkenness
the
fashionable
vices
of
that
age
he
was
a
refined
social
and
cultivated
man
this
statesman
perceived
that
it
was
imperatively
necessary
for
the
success
of
his
party
to
undermine
the
overpowering
influence
of
the
duchess
of
marlborough
with
the
queen
he
detested
her
arrogance
disdain
and
grasping
ambition
moreover
he
had
the
firm
conviction
that
england
should
engage
only
in
maritime
war
he
hated
the
dutch
and
moneyed
men
and
dissenters
of
every
sect
although
originally
one
of
them
and
when
he
had
obtained
the
leadership
of
his
party
in
the
house
of
commons
he
brought
to
bear
the
whole
force
of
his
intellect
against
both
the
duke
and
duchess
it
was
by
his
intrigues
that
the
intimate
relations
between
the
duchess
and
the
queen
were
broken
up
and
that
the
duke
became
unpopular
the
great
instrument
by
which
he
effected
the
disgrace
of
the
imperious
duchess
was
a
woman
who
was
equally
his
cousin
and
the
cousin
of
the
duchess
and
for
whom
the
favorite
had
procured
the
office
of
and
dresser
in
other
words
a
position
which
in
an
inferior
rank
is
called
that
of
for
the
duchess
was
wearied
of
constant
attendance
on
the
queen
and
to
this
woman
some
of
her
old
duties
were
delegated
the
name
of
this
woman
was
abigail
hill
she
had
been
in
very
modest
circumstances
but
was
a
person
of
extraordinary
tact
prudence
and
discretion
though
very
humble
in
her
address
qualities
the
reverse
of
those
which
marked
her
great
relative
nor
did
the
proud
duchess
comprehend
miss
hill
character
and
designs
any
more
than
the
madame
de
montespan
comprehended
those
of
the
widow
scarron
when
she
made
her
the
governess
of
her
children
but
harley
understood
her
and
their
principles
and
aims
were
in
harmony
abigail
hill
was
a
bigoted
tory
and
her
supreme
desire
was
to
ingratiate
herself
in
the
favor
of
her
royal
mistress
especially
when
she
was
tired
of
the
neglect
or
annoyed
by
the
railleries
of
her
exacting
favorite
by
degrees
the
humble
obtained
the
same
ascendency
over
the
queen
that
had
been
exercised
by
the
mistress
of
the
robes
in
the
one
case
secured
by
humility
assiduous
attention
and
constant
flatteries
in
the
other
obtained
by
talent
and
brilliant
fascinations
abigail
was
ruled
by
harley
sarah
was
ruled
by
no
one
but
her
husband
who
understood
her
caprices
and
resentments
and
seldom
directly
opposed
her
moreover
she
was
a
woman
who
could
listen
to
reason
after
her
fits
of
passion
had
passed
away
the
first
thing
of
note
which
occurred
showing
to
the
duchess
that
her
influence
was
undermined
was
the
refusal
of
the
queen
to
allow
lord
cowper
the
lord
chancellor
to
fill
up
the
various
livings
belonging
to
the
crown
in
spite
of
the
urgent
solicitations
of
the
duchess
this
naturally
produced
a
coolness
between
freeman
and
morley
harley
was
now
the
confidential
adviser
of
the
queen
and
counselled
her
to
go
alone
that
is
to
throw
off
the
shackles
which
she
had
too
long
ignominiously
worn
and
anne
at
once
appointed
divines
tories
of
course
to
the
two
vacant
bishoprics
the
of
faction
was
flowing
unseen
but
deep
and
strong
which
the
infatuated
duchess
did
not
suspect
the
great
victory
of
ramillies
gave
so
much
to
marlborough
that
the
outbreak
between
his
wife
and
the
queen
was
delayed
for
a
time
that
victory
gave
a
new
lease
of
power
to
the
whigs
harley
and
john
the
secret
enemies
of
the
duke
welcomed
him
with
their
usual
smiles
and
flatteries
and
even
voted
for
the
erection
of
blenheim
one
of
the
most
expensive
palaces
ever
built
in
england
meanwhile
harley
pursued
his
intrigues
to
effect
the
downfall
of
the
duchess
miss
hill
unknown
to
her
great
relative
and
patroness
married
masham
equerry
to
prince
george
who
was
shortly
after
made
a
and
peer
nothing
could
surpass
the
indignation
of
the
duchess
when
she
heard
of
this
secret
marriage
that
it
should
be
concealed
from
her
while
it
was
known
to
the
queen
showed
conclusively
that
her
power
over
anne
was
gone
and
still
further
she
perceived
that
she
was
supplanted
by
a
relative
whom
she
had
raised
from
obscurity
she
now
comprehended
the
great
influence
of
harley
at
court
and
also
the
declining
favor
of
her
husband
it
was
a
bitter
reflection
to
the
proud
duchess
that
the
alienation
of
the
queen
was
the
result
of
her
own
folly
and
pride
rather
than
of
royal
capriciousness
she
now
paid
no
inconsiderable
penalty
for
the
neglect
of
her
mistress
and
the
gratification
of
her
pride
pride
has
ever
been
the
chief
cause
of
the
downfall
of
royal
favorites
it
ruined
louvois
wolsey
and
thomas
cromwell
it
broke
the
chain
which
bound
louis
xiv
to
the
imperious
montespan
it
ever
goes
before
destruction
the
duchess
of
marlborough
forgot
that
her
friend
morley
was
also
her
sovereign
the
queen
she
might
have
retained
the
queen
favor
to
the
end
in
spite
of
political
opinions
but
she
presumed
too
far
on
the
ascendency
which
she
had
enjoyed
for
nearly
thirty
years
there
is
no
height
from
which
one
may
not
fall
and
it
takes
more
ability
to
retain
a
proud
position
than
to
gain
it
there
are
very
few
persons
who
are
beyond
the
reach
of
envy
and
detraction
and
the
loftier
the
position
one
occupies
the
more
subtle
numerous
and
desperate
are
one
secret
enemies
the
duchess
was
not
however
immediately
disgraced
as
the
expression
is
in
reference
to
great
people
who
lose
favor
at
court
she
still
retained
her
offices
and
her
apartments
in
the
royal
palace
she
still
had
access
to
the
queen
she
was
still
addressed
as
my
dear
mrs
freeman
but
masham
had
supplanted
her
and
harley
through
the
influence
of
the
new
favorite
ruled
at
court
the
disaffection
which
had
long
existed
between
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
lord
treasurer
deepened
into
absolute
aversion
it
became
the
aim
of
both
ministers
to
ruin
each
other
the
queen
now
secretly
sided
with
the
tories
although
she
had
not
the
courage
to
quarrel
openly
with
her
powerful
ministers
or
with
her
former
favorite
nor
was
the
great
breach
made
public
but
the
angry
and
disappointed
duchess
gave
vent
to
her
wrath
and
vengeance
in
letters
to
her
husband
and
in
speech
to
godolphin
she
entreated
them
to
avenge
her
quarrel
she
employed
spies
about
the
queen
she
brought
to
bear
her
whole
influence
on
the
leaders
of
the
whigs
she
prepared
herself
for
an
open
conflict
with
her
sovereign
for
she
saw
clearly
that
the
old
relations
of
friendship
and
confidence
between
them
would
never
return
a
broken
friendship
is
a
broken
jar
it
may
be
mended
but
never
restored
its
glory
has
departed
and
this
is
one
of
the
bitterest
experiences
of
life
on
whomsoever
the
fault
may
be
laid
the
fault
in
this
instance
was
on
the
side
of
the
duchess
and
not
on
that
of
her
patron
the
arrogance
and
dictation
of
the
favorite
had
become
intolerable
it
was
as
hard
to
bear
as
the
insolence
of
a
petted
servant
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
lord
godolphin
took
up
the
quarrel
with
zeal
they
were
both
at
the
summit
of
power
and
both
were
leaders
of
their
party
the
victories
of
the
former
had
made
him
the
most
famous
man
in
europe
and
the
greatest
subject
in
england
they
declined
to
serve
their
sovereign
any
longer
unless
harley
were
dismissed
from
office
and
the
able
secretary
of
state
was
obliged
to
resign
but
anne
could
not
forget
that
she
was
forced
to
part
with
her
confidential
minister
and
continued
to
be
ruled
by
his
counsels
she
had
secret
nocturnal
meetings
in
the
palace
with
both
harley
and
masham
to
the
chagrin
of
the
ministers
the
court
became
the
scene
of
intrigues
and
cabals
not
only
was
harley
dismissed
but
also
henry
john
afterwards
the
famous
lord
bolingbroke
the
intimate
friend
and
patron
of
pope
he
was
secretary
of
war
and
was
a
man
of
great
ability
of
more
genius
even
than
harley
he
was
an
infidel
in
his
religious
opinions
and
profligate
in
his
private
life
like
harley
he
was
born
of
puritan
parents
and
like
him
repudiated
his
early
principles
he
was
the
most
eloquent
orator
in
the
house
of
commons
which
he
entered
in
as
a
whig
at
that
time
he
was
much
admired
by
marlborough
who
used
his
influence
to
secure
his
entrance
into
the
cabinet
his
most
remarkable
qualities
were
political
sagacity
and
penetration
into
the
motives
and
dispositions
of
men
he
gradually
went
over
to
the
tories
and
his
alliance
with
harley
was
strengthened
by
personal
friendship
as
well
as
political
sympathies
he
was
the
most
interesting
man
of
his
age
in
society
witty
bright
and
courtly
in
conversational
powers
he
was
surpassed
only
by
swift
meanwhile
the
breach
between
the
queen
and
the
duchess
gradually
widened
and
as
the
former
grew
cold
in
her
treatment
of
her
old
friend
she
at
the
same
time
annoyed
her
ministers
by
the
appointment
of
tory
bishops
to
the
vacant
sees
she
went
so
far
as
to
encroach
on
the
prerogatives
of
the
general
of
her
armies
by
making
military
appointments
without
his
consent
this
interference
marlborough
properly
resented
but
his
influence
was
now
on
the
wane
as
the
nation
wearied
of
a
war
which
as
it
seemed
to
the
tories
he
needlessly
prolonged
moreover
the
duke
of
somerset
piqued
by
the
refusal
of
the
general
to
give
a
regiment
to
his
son
withdrew
his
support
from
the
government
the
duke
of
shrewsbury
and
other
discontented
noblemen
left
the
whig
party
the
unwise
prosecution
of
sacheverell
for
a
seditious
libel
united
the
whole
tory
party
in
a
fierce
opposition
to
the
government
which
was
becoming
every
day
more
unpopular
harley
was
indefatigable
in
intrigues
he
fasted
with
religious
zealots
and
feasted
with
convivial
friends
he
promised
everything
to
everybody
but
kept
his
own
counsels
in
such
a
state
of
affairs
with
the
growing
alienation
of
the
queen
it
became
necessary
for
the
proud
duchess
to
resign
her
offices
but
before
doing
this
she
made
one
final
effort
to
regain
what
she
had
lost
she
besought
the
queen
for
a
private
interview
which
was
refused
again
importuned
her
majesty
sullenly
granted
the
interview
but
refused
to
explain
anything
and
even
abruptly
left
the
room
and
was
so
rude
that
the
duchess
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
which
she
could
not
restrain
not
tears
of
grief
but
tears
of
wrath
and
shame
thus
was
finally
ended
the
memorable
friendship
between
morley
and
freeman
which
had
continued
for
years
the
queen
and
duchess
never
met
again
soon
after
in
followed
the
dismissal
of
lord
godolphin
as
lord
treasurer
who
was
succeeded
by
harley
created
earl
of
oxford
sunderland
too
was
dismissed
and
his
post
of
secretary
of
state
was
given
to
john
created
viscount
bolingbroke
lord
cowper
resigned
the
seals
and
sir
simon
harcourt
an
avowed
adherent
of
the
pretender
became
lord
chancellor
the
earl
of
rochester
the
bitterest
of
all
the
tories
was
appointed
president
of
the
council
the
duke
of
marlborough
however
was
not
dismissed
from
his
high
command
until
one
reason
for
his
dismissal
was
that
he
was
suspected
of
aiming
to
make
himself
supreme
on
his
return
from
the
battle
of
malplaquet
he
had
coolly
demanded
to
be
made
for
life
such
a
haughty
demand
would
have
been
regarded
as
dangerous
in
a
great
crisis
it
was
absurd
when
public
dangers
had
passed
away
even
lord
cowper
his
friend
the
chancellor
shrunk
from
it
with
amazement
such
a
demand
would
have
been
deemed
arrogant
in
wallenstein
amid
the
successes
of
gustavus
adolphus
no
insignificant
cause
of
the
triumph
of
the
tory
party
at
this
time
was
the
patronage
which
the
tory
leaders
extended
to
men
of
letters
and
the
bitter
political
tracts
which
these
literary
men
wrote
and
for
which
they
were
paid
in
that
age
the
speeches
of
members
of
parliament
were
not
reported
or
published
and
hence
had
but
little
influence
on
public
opinion
even
ministers
resorted
to
political
tracts
to
sustain
their
power
or
to
undermine
that
of
their
opponents
and
these
were
more
efficient
than
speeches
in
the
house
of
commons
bolingbroke
was
the
most
eloquent
orator
of
his
day
but
no
orators
arose
in
anne
reign
equal
to
pitt
and
fox
in
the
reign
of
george
iii
hence
the
political
leaders
availed
themselves
of
the
writings
of
men
of
letters
with
whom
they
freely
associated
and
this
intercourse
was
deemed
a
great
condescension
on
the
part
of
nobles
and
cabinet
ministers
in
that
age
great
men
were
not
those
who
were
famous
for
genius
but
those
who
were
exalted
in
social
position
still
genius
was
held
in
high
honor
by
those
who
controlled
public
affairs
whenever
it
could
be
made
subservient
to
their
interests
foremost
among
the
men
of
genius
who
lent
their
pen
to
the
service
of
nobles
and
statesmen
was
jonathan
swift
clergyman
poet
and
satirist
but
he
was
more
famous
for
his
satire
than
for
his
sermons
or
his
poetry
everybody
winced
under
his
terrible
assaults
he
was
both
feared
and
hated
especially
by
the
great
hence
they
flattered
him
and
courted
his
society
he
became
the
intimate
friend
and
companion
of
oxford
and
bolingbroke
he
dined
with
the
prime
minister
every
sunday
and
in
fact
as
often
as
he
pleased
he
rarely
dined
at
home
and
almost
lived
in
the
houses
of
the
highest
nobles
who
welcomed
him
not
only
for
the
aid
he
gave
them
by
his
writings
but
for
his
wit
and
agreeable
discourse
at
one
time
he
was
the
most
influential
man
in
england
although
poor
and
without
office
or
preferment
he
possessed
two
or
three
livings
in
ireland
which
together
brought
him
about
on
which
he
lived
generally
in
london
at
least
when
his
friends
were
in
power
they
could
not
spare
him
and
he
was
intrusted
with
the
most
important
secrets
of
state
his
insolence
was
superb
he
affected
equality
with
dukes
and
earls
he
condescended
to
accept
their
banquets
the
first
time
that
bolingbroke
invited
him
to
dine
his
reply
was
that
if
the
queen
gave
his
lordship
a
dukedom
and
the
garter
and
the
treasury
also
he
would
regard
them
no
more
than
he
would
a
groat
this
assumed
independence
was
the
habit
of
his
life
he
indignantly
returned
to
harley
which
the
minister
had
sent
him
as
a
gift
he
did
not
work
for
money
but
for
influence
and
a
promised
bishopric
but
the
queen
a
pious
woman
of
the
conventional
school
would
never
hear
of
his
elevation
to
the
bench
of
bishops
in
consequence
of
the
tale
of
a
tub
in
which
he
had
ridiculed
everything
sacred
and
profane
he
was
the
bitterest
satirist
that
england
has
produced
the
most
his
powerful
friends
could
do
for
him
was
to
give
him
the
deanery
of
patrick
in
dublin
worth
about
a
year
swift
was
first
brought
to
notice
by
sir
william
temple
in
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
he
being
sir
william
secretary
at
first
he
was
a
whig
and
a
friend
of
addison
but
neglected
by
marlborough
and
godolphin
who
cared
but
little
for
literary
genius
he
became
a
tory
in
he
became
associated
with
harley
john
atterbury
and
prior
in
the
defence
of
the
tory
party
but
he
never
relinquished
his
friendship
with
addison
for
whom
he
had
profound
respect
and
admiration
swift
life
was
worldly
but
moral
he
was
remarkably
temperate
in
eating
and
drinking
and
parsimonious
in
his
habits
one
of
his
most
bitter
complaints
in
his
letters
to
stella
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
was
of
the
expense
of
in
his
visits
to
nobles
and
statesmen
it
would
seem
that
he
creditably
discharged
his
clerical
duties
he
attended
the
daily
service
in
the
cathedral
and
preached
when
his
turn
came
he
was
charitable
to
the
poor
and
was
a
friend
to
ireland
to
whose
people
he
rendered
great
services
from
his
influence
with
the
government
he
was
beloved
greatly
by
the
irish
nation
in
spite
of
his
asperity
parsimony
and
bad
temper
he
is
generally
regarded
by
critics
as
a
selfish
and
heartless
man
and
his
treatment
of
the
two
women
whose
affections
he
had
gained
was
certainly
inexplicable
and
detestable
his
old
age
was
miserable
and
sad
he
died
insane
having
survived
his
friends
and
his
influence
but
his
writings
have
lived
his
gulliver
travels
is
still
one
of
the
most
famous
and
popular
books
in
our
language
in
spite
of
its
revolting
and
vulgar
details
swift
like
addison
was
a
great
master
of
style
clear
forcible
and
natural
and
in
vigor
he
surpassed
any
writer
of
his
age
it
was
the
misfortune
of
the
duchess
of
marlborough
to
have
this
witty
and
malignant
satirist
for
an
enemy
he
exposed
her
peculiarities
and
laid
bare
her
character
with
fearless
effrontery
it
was
thus
that
he
attacked
the
most
powerful
woman
in
england
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
appropriated
a
year
out
of
her
allowance
for
certain
uses
which
the
lady
received
or
was
to
pay
to
the
lady
or
her
order
when
called
for
but
after
eight
years
it
appeared
upon
the
strictest
calculation
that
the
woman
had
paid
but
and
sunk
for
her
own
pocket
it
is
but
supposing
instead
of
and
by
that
you
may
judge
what
the
pretensions
of
modern
merit
are
when
it
happens
to
be
its
own
paymaster
who
could
stand
before
such
insinuations
the
duchess
afterwards
attempted
to
defend
herself
against
the
charge
of
peculation
as
the
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
but
no
one
believed
her
she
was
notoriously
avaricious
and
unscrupulous
swift
spared
no
personage
in
the
party
of
the
whigs
when
by
so
doing
he
could
please
the
leaders
of
the
tories
and
he
wrote
in
an
age
when
libels
were
scandalous
and
savage
libels
which
would
now
subject
their
authors
to
punishment
the
acrimony
of
party
strife
at
that
time
has
never
since
been
equalled
even
poets
attacked
each
other
with
savage
recklessness
there
was
no
criticism
after
the
style
of
writers
sought
either
to
annihilate
or
to
extravagantly
praise
the
jealousy
which
poets
displayed
in
reference
to
each
other
productions
was
as
unreasonable
and
bitter
as
the
envy
and
strife
between
country
doctors
or
musicians
at
the
opera
there
was
one
great
writer
in
the
age
of
queen
anne
who
was
an
exception
to
this
nearly
universal
envy
and
bitterness
and
this
was
addison
who
was
as
serene
and
calm
as
other
critics
were
furious
and
unjust
even
swift
spared
this
amiable
and
accomplished
writer
although
he
belonged
to
the
whig
party
joseph
addison
born
in
was
the
most
fortunate
man
of
letters
in
his
age
perhaps
in
any
succeeding
age
in
english
history
he
was
early
distinguished
as
a
writer
of
latin
poems
and
in
at
the
age
of
the
young
scholar
was
sent
by
montague
at
the
recommendation
of
somers
to
the
continent
on
a
pension
of
a
year
to
study
languages
with
a
view
to
the
diplomatic
service
on
the
accession
of
anne
addison
was
obliged
to
return
to
literature
for
his
support
solicited
by
godolphin
under
the
advice
of
halifax
to
write
a
poem
on
the
victories
of
marlborough
he
wrote
one
so
popular
that
he
rapidly
rose
in
favor
with
the
whig
ministry
in
he
was
made
secretary
for
ireland
under
lord
wharton
and
entered
parliament
he
afterwards
was
made
secretary
of
state
married
a
peeress
and
spent
his
last
days
at
holland
house
but
addison
was
no
politician
nor
did
he
distinguish
himself
in
parliament
or
as
a
political
writer
he
could
not
make
a
speech
not
having
been
trained
to
debate
he
was
too
timid
and
his
taste
was
too
severe
for
the
arena
of
politicians
he
is
immortal
for
his
essays
in
which
his
humor
is
transcendent
and
his
style
easy
and
graceful
as
a
writer
he
is
a
great
artist
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
equal
him
in
the
charming
simplicity
of
his
style
macaulay
a
great
artist
himself
in
the
use
of
language
places
addison
on
the
summit
of
literary
excellence
and
fame
as
an
essayist
one
is
at
loss
to
comprehend
why
so
quiet
and
unobtrusive
a
scholar
should
have
been
selected
for
important
political
positions
but
can
easily
understand
why
he
was
the
admiration
of
the
highest
social
circles
for
his
wit
and
the
elegance
of
his
conversation
he
was
the
personification
of
urbanity
and
every
gentlemanly
quality
as
well
as
one
of
the
best
scholars
of
his
age
but
it
was
only
in
an
aristocratic
age
when
a
few
great
nobles
controlled
public
affairs
that
such
a
man
could
have
been
so
recognized
rewarded
and
honored
he
died
beloved
and
universally
lamented
and
his
writings
are
still
classics
and
likely
to
remain
so
he
was
not
an
oracle
in
general
society
like
mackintosh
and
macaulay
but
among
congenial
and
trusted
friends
he
gave
full
play
to
his
humor
and
was
as
charming
as
washington
irving
is
said
to
have
been
in
his
chosen
circle
of
admirers
although
he
was
a
whig
we
do
not
read
of
any
particular
intimacy
with
such
men
as
marlborough
and
godolphin
marlborough
though
an
accomplished
and
amiable
man
was
not
fond
of
the
society
of
wits
as
were
halifax
montague
harley
and
john
as
for
the
duchess
she
was
too
proud
and
grand
for
such
a
retired
scholar
as
addison
to
feel
at
ease
in
her
worldly
coteries
she
cared
no
more
for
poetry
or
severe
intellectual
culture
than
politicians
generally
do
she
shone
only
in
a
galaxy
of
ladies
of
rank
and
fashion
i
do
not
read
that
she
ever
took
a
literary
man
into
her
service
and
she
had
no
more
taste
for
letters
than
the
sovereign
she
served
she
was
doubtless
intellectual
shrewd
and
discriminating
but
her
intellect
was
directed
to
current
political
movements
and
she
was
coarse
in
her
language
she
would
swear
like
queen
elizabeth
when
excited
to
anger
and
her
wrath
was
terrible
on
the
dismissal
of
the
great
duke
from
all
his
offices
and
the
disgrace
of
his
wife
at
court
they
led
a
comparatively
quiet
life
abroad
the
duchess
had
parted
with
her
offices
with
great
reluctance
even
when
the
queen
sent
for
the
golden
keys
which
were
the
badge
of
her
office
she
refused
to
surrender
them
no
one
could
do
anything
with
the
infuriated
termagant
and
all
were
afraid
of
her
she
threatened
to
print
the
private
correspondence
of
the
queen
as
morley
the
ministers
dared
not
go
into
her
presence
so
fierce
was
her
character
when
offended
to
take
from
her
the
badge
of
office
was
like
trying
to
separate
a
fierce
lioness
from
her
whelps
the
only
person
who
could
manage
her
was
her
husband
and
when
at
last
he
compelled
her
to
give
up
the
keys
she
threw
them
in
a
storm
of
passion
at
his
head
and
raved
like
a
maniac
it
is
amazing
how
the
queen
could
have
borne
so
long
with
the
duchess
ungovernable
temper
and
still
more
so
how
her
husband
could
but
he
was
always
mild
and
meek
in
the
retirement
of
his
home
a
truly
domestic
man
to
whom
pomp
was
a
weariness
moreover
he
was
a
singularly
fortunate
man
his
ambition
and
pride
and
avarice
were
gratified
beyond
precedent
in
english
history
he
had
become
the
foremost
man
in
his
country
and
perhaps
of
his
age
and
his
wife
was
still
looked
to
as
a
great
personage
not
only
because
of
her
position
and
rank
but
for
her
abilities
which
were
doubtless
great
she
was
still
a
power
in
the
land
and
was
surrounded
by
children
and
grandchildren
who
occupied
some
of
the
highest
social
positions
in
england
but
she
was
not
happy
what
can
satisfy
a
restless
and
ambitious
woman
whose
happiness
is
in
external
pleasures
there
is
a
limit
to
the
favors
which
fortune
showers
and
when
the
limits
of
success
are
reached
there
must
be
disappointment
the
duchess
was
discontented
and
became
morose
quarrelsome
and
hard
to
please
her
children
did
not
love
her
and
some
were
in
bitter
opposition
to
her
she
was
perpetually
embroiled
in
family
quarrels
nothing
could
soften
the
asperity
of
her
temper
or
restrain
her
unreasonable
exactions
at
last
england
became
hateful
to
her
and
she
and
her
husband
quitted
it
and
resided
abroad
for
several
years
in
the
retirement
of
voluntary
exile
she
answered
the
numerous
accusations
against
her
for
she
was
maligned
on
every
side
and
generally
disliked
since
her
arrogance
had
become
insupportable
even
to
her
daughters
meanwhile
the
last
days
of
queen
anne
weary
existence
were
drawing
to
a
close
she
was
assailed
with
innumerable
annoyances
her
body
was
racked
with
the
gout
and
her
feeble
mind
was
distracted
by
the
contradictory
counsels
of
her
advisers
any
allusion
to
her
successor
was
a
knell
of
agony
to
her
disturbed
soul
she
became
suspicious
and
was
even
alienated
from
harley
whom
she
dismissed
from
office
only
a
few
days
before
her
death
which
took
place
she
died
without
signing
her
will
by
which
omission
masham
was
deprived
of
her
legacy
she
died
childless
and
the
elector
george
of
hanover
ascended
her
throne
on
the
death
of
the
queen
marlborough
returned
to
england
and
it
was
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
new
king
to
restore
to
him
the
post
of
of
the
land
forces
while
his
sunderland
was
made
of
ireland
a
whig
cabinet
was
formed
but
the
duke
never
regained
his
old
political
influence
and
he
gradually
retired
to
private
life
residing
with
the
duchess
almost
wholly
at
holywell
his
peaceful
retirement
for
which
he
had
longed
came
at
last
he
employed
his
time
in
surveying
the
progress
of
the
building
of
blenheim
in
which
palace
he
was
never
destined
to
live
and
in
simple
pleasures
for
which
he
never
lost
a
taste
his
wife
occupied
herself
in
matrimonial
projects
for
her
grandchildren
seeking
alliances
of
ambition
and
interest
in
the
duke
of
marlborough
was
attacked
with
a
paralytic
fit
from
the
effects
of
which
he
only
partially
recovered
to
restore
his
health
he
went
to
bath
then
the
fashionable
and
favorite
whose
waters
were
deemed
beneficial
to
invalids
and
here
it
was
one
of
the
scandals
of
the
day
that
the
rich
nobleman
would
hobble
from
the
public
room
to
his
lodgings
in
a
cold
dark
night
to
save
sixpence
in
his
enjoyments
were
now
few
and
transient
his
nervous
system
was
completely
shattered
after
so
many
labors
and
exposures
in
his
numerous
campaigns
he
lingered
till
when
he
died
leaving
a
fortune
of
a
million
and
a
half
pounds
sterling
besides
his
vast
estates
no
subject
at
that
time
had
so
large
an
income
he
left
a
military
fame
never
surpassed
in
england
except
by
wellington
and
a
name
unstained
by
cruelty
so
distinguished
a
man
of
course
received
at
his
death
unparalleled
funeral
honors
he
was
followed
to
his
temporary
in
the
vaults
of
westminster
by
the
most
imposing
procession
that
england
had
ever
seen
the
duchess
of
marlborough
was
now
the
richest
woman
in
england
whatever
influence
proceeds
from
rank
and
riches
she
still
possessed
though
the
titles
and
honors
of
the
dukedom
descended
by
act
of
parliament
in
to
the
countess
of
godolphin
with
whom
she
was
at
war
the
duchess
was
now
with
unbroken
health
and
inextinguishable
ambition
she
resided
chiefly
at
windsor
lodge
for
she
held
for
life
the
office
of
ranger
of
the
forest
it
was
then
that
she
was
so
severely
castigated
by
pope
in
his
satirical
lines
on
atossa
that
she
is
said
to
have
sent
to
the
poet
to
suppress
the
libel
her
avarice
and
wrath
giving
way
to
her
policy
and
pride
for
twenty
years
after
the
death
of
her
husband
she
continued
an
intriguing
politician
but
on
with
sir
robert
walpole
the
prime
minister
whom
she
cordially
hated
more
because
of
money
transactions
than
political
disagreement
she
was
a
very
disagreeable
old
woman
yet
not
without
influence
if
she
was
without
friends
she
had
at
least
the
merit
of
frankness
for
she
concealed
none
of
her
opinions
of
the
king
nor
of
his
ministers
nor
of
distinguished
nobles
she
was
querulous
and
full
of
complaints
and
exactions
one
of
her
bitterest
complaints
was
that
she
was
compelled
to
pay
taxes
on
her
house
in
windsor
park
she
would
even
utter
her
complaints
before
servants
litigation
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
if
she
had
reason
on
her
side
whether
she
had
law
or
not
it
was
not
the
good
fortune
of
this
but
unhappy
woman
to
assemble
around
her
in
her
declining
years
children
and
grandchildren
who
were
attached
to
her
she
had
alienated
even
them
she
had
no
intimate
friends
a
woman
not
beloved
by
her
own
children
can
have
but
little
claim
to
the
affections
of
others
as
we
have
already
said
the
duchess
was
at
open
variance
with
her
oldest
daughter
henrietta
the
countess
of
godolphin
to
whom
she
was
never
reconciled
her
quarrels
with
her
granddaughter
lady
anne
egerton
afterwards
duchess
of
bedford
were
violent
and
incessant
she
lived
in
perpetual
altercation
with
her
youngest
daughter
the
duchess
of
montague
she
never
was
beloved
by
any
of
her
children
at
any
time
since
they
were
in
childhood
and
youth
intrusted
to
the
care
of
servants
and
teachers
while
the
mother
was
absorbed
in
political
cabals
at
court
she
consulted
their
interest
merely
in
making
for
them
grand
alliances
to
gratify
her
family
pride
her
whole
life
was
absorbed
in
pride
and
ambition
nor
did
the
mortification
of
a
dishonored
old
age
improve
her
temper
she
sought
neither
the
consolation
of
religion
nor
the
intellectual
stimulus
of
history
and
philosophy
to
the
last
she
was
as
worldly
as
she
was
morose
to
the
last
she
was
a
dissatisfied
politician
she
reviled
the
whig
administration
of
walpole
as
fiercely
as
she
did
the
tory
administration
of
oxford
she
haughtily
refused
the
order
of
the
bath
for
her
grandson
the
duke
of
marlborough
which
walpole
offered
contented
with
nothing
less
than
the
garter
madam
replied
walpole
they
who
take
the
bath
will
sooner
have
the
garter
in
her
old
age
her
ruling
passion
was
hatred
of
walpole
i
think
she
wrote
is
thought
wrong
to
wish
anybody
dead
but
i
hope
is
none
to
wish
he
may
be
hanged
her
wishes
were
partly
gratified
for
she
lived
long
enough
to
see
this
great
statesman
so
long
supreme
driven
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
tower
for
his
son
horace
she
had
equal
dislike
and
he
returned
her
hatred
with
malignant
satire
old
marlborough
is
dying
said
the
wit
but
who
can
tell
last
year
she
had
lain
a
great
while
ill
without
speaking
and
her
physician
told
her
that
she
must
be
blistered
or
she
would
die
she
cried
out
wo
be
blistered
and
i
wo
die
she
did
indeed
last
some
time
longer
but
with
increasing
infirmities
her
amusements
and
pleasures
became
yearly
more
circumscribed
in
former
years
she
had
sometimes
occupied
her
mind
with
the
purchase
of
land
for
she
was
shrewd
and
rarely
made
a
bad
bargain
even
at
the
age
of
eighty
she
went
to
the
city
to
bid
in
person
for
the
estate
of
lord
yarmouth
but
as
her
darkened
day
approached
its
melancholy
close
she
amused
herself
by
dictating
in
bed
her
vindication
after
spending
thus
six
hours
daily
with
her
secretary
she
had
recourse
to
her
chamber
organ
the
eight
tunes
of
which
she
thought
much
better
to
hear
than
going
to
the
italian
opera
even
society
in
which
she
once
shone
for
her
intellect
was
bright
and
her
person
beautiful
at
last
wearied
her
and
gave
her
no
pleasure
like
many
lonely
discontented
women
she
became
attached
to
animals
she
petted
three
dogs
in
which
she
saw
virtues
that
neither
men
nor
women
possessed
in
her
disquiet
she
often
changed
her
residence
she
went
from
marlborough
house
to
windsor
lodge
and
from
windsor
lodge
to
wimbledon
only
to
discover
that
each
place
was
damp
and
unhealthy
wrapt
up
in
flannels
and
wheeled
up
and
down
her
room
in
a
chair
she
discovered
that
wealth
can
only
mitigate
the
evils
of
humanity
and
realized
how
wretched
is
any
person
with
a
soul
filled
with
discontent
and
bitterness
when
animal
spirits
are
destroyed
by
the
infirmities
of
old
age
all
the
views
of
this
spoiled
favorite
of
fortune
were
bounded
by
the
scenes
immediately
before
her
while
she
was
not
sceptical
she
was
far
from
being
religious
and
hence
she
was
deprived
of
the
highest
consolations
given
to
people
in
disappointment
and
sorrow
and
neglect
the
older
she
grew
the
more
tenaciously
did
she
cling
to
temporal
possessions
and
the
more
keenly
did
she
feel
occasional
losses
her
intellect
remained
unclouded
but
her
feelings
became
callous
while
she
had
no
reverence
for
the
dead
she
felt
increasing
contempt
for
the
living
forgetting
that
no
one
however
exalted
can
live
at
peace
in
an
atmosphere
of
disdain
at
last
she
died
in
unlamented
and
unloved
in
the
year
of
her
age
and
was
interred
by
the
side
of
her
husband
in
the
tomb
in
the
chapel
of
blenheim
she
left
a
year
to
her
grandson
lord
john
spencer
provided
he
would
never
accept
any
civil
or
military
office
from
the
government
she
left
also
to
lord
chesterfield
together
with
her
most
valuable
diamond
but
only
small
sums
to
most
of
her
relatives
or
to
charities
the
residue
of
her
property
she
left
to
that
other
grandson
who
inherited
the
title
and
estates
of
her
husband
a
year
her
estimated
income
besides
a
costly
collection
of
jewels
one
of
the
most
valuable
in
europe
were
a
great
property
when
few
noblemen
at
that
time
had
over
a
year
the
life
of
sarah
duchess
of
marlborough
is
a
sad
one
to
contemplate
with
all
her
riches
and
honors
let
those
who
envy
wealth
or
rank
learn
from
her
history
how
little
worldly
prosperity
can
secure
happiness
or
esteem
without
the
solid
virtues
of
the
heart
the
richest
and
most
prosperous
woman
of
her
times
was
the
object
of
blended
derision
contempt
and
hatred
throughout
the
land
which
she
might
have
adorned
why
then
it
may
be
asked
should
i
single
out
such
a
woman
for
a
lecture
a
woman
who
added
neither
to
human
happiness
national
prosperity
nor
the
civilization
of
her
age
why
have
i
chosen
her
as
one
of
the
beacon
lights
of
history
because
i
know
of
no
woman
who
has
filled
so
exalted
a
position
in
society
and
is
so
prominent
a
figure
in
history
whose
career
is
a
more
impressive
warning
of
the
dangers
to
be
shunned
by
those
who
embark
on
the
perilous
and
troubled
seas
of
mere
worldly
ambition
god
gave
her
that
to
which
she
aspired
and
which
so
many

of

as
madame
récamier
so
i
select
her
as
the
representative
of
her
class
it
was
in
italy
that
women
first
drew
to
their
the
distinguished
men
of
their
age
and
exercised
over
them
a
commanding
influence
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
olympia
fulvia
morata
was
the
pride
of
ferrara
eloquent
with
the
music
of
homer
and
virgil
a
miracle
to
all
who
heard
her
giving
public
lectures
to
nobles
and
professors
when
only
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
vittoria
colonna
was
the
ornament
of
the
court
of
naples
and
afterwards
drew
around
her
at
rome
the
choicest
society
of
that
elegant
capital
bishops
princes
and
artists
equally
the
friend
of
cardinal
pole
and
of
michael
angelo
and
reigning
in
her
retired
apartments
in
the
benedictine
convent
of
anne
even
as
the
duchesse
de
longueville
shone
at
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
with
de
retz
and
la
rochefoucauld
at
her
feet
this
was
at
a
period
when
the
italian
cities
were
the
centre
of
the
new
civilization
which
the
renaissance
created
when
ancient
learning
and
art
were
cultivated
with
an
enthusiasm
never
since
surpassed
the
new
position
which
women
seem
to
have
occupied
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
italy
was
in
part
owing
to
the
wealth
and
culture
of
cities
ever
the
paradise
of
ambitious
women
and
the
influence
of
poetry
and
chivalry
of
which
the
italians
were
the
earliest
admirers
provençal
poetry
was
studied
in
italy
as
early
as
the
time
of
dante
and
veneration
for
woman
was
carried
to
a
romantic
excess
when
the
rest
of
europe
was
comparatively
rude
even
in
the
eleventh
century
we
see
in
the
southern
part
of
europe
a
respectful
enthusiasm
for
woman
coeval
with
the
birth
of
chivalry
the
gay
troubadours
expounded
and
explained
the
subtile
metaphysics
of
love
in
every
possible
way
a
peerless
lady
was
supposed
to
unite
every
possible
moral
virtue
with
beauty
and
rank
and
hence
chivalric
love
was
based
on
sentiment
alone
provence
gave
birth
both
to
chivalry
and
poetry
and
they
were
singularly
blended
together
of
about
five
hundred
troubadours
whose
names
have
descended
to
us
more
than
half
were
noble
for
chivalry
took
cognizance
only
of
noble
birth
from
provence
chivalry
spread
to
italy
and
to
the
north
of
france
and
normandy
became
a
country
of
noble
deeds
though
not
the
land
of
song
it
was
in
italy
that
the
poetical
development
was
greatest
after
chivalry
as
an
institution
had
passed
away
it
still
left
its
spirit
on
society
there
was
not
however
much
society
in
europe
anywhere
until
cities
arose
and
became
centres
of
culture
and
art
in
the
feudal
castle
there
were
chivalric
sentiments
but
not
society
where
men
and
women
of
cultivation
meet
to
give
expression
and
scope
to
their
ideas
and
sentiments
nor
can
there
be
a
high
society
without
the
aid
of
letters
society
did
not
arise
until
scholars
and
poets
mingled
with
nobles
as
companions
this
sort
of
society
gained
celebrity
first
in
paris
when
women
of
rank
invited
to
their
literary
men
as
well
as
nobles
the
first
person
who
gave
a
marked
impulse
to
what
we
call
society
was
the
marquise
de
rambouillet
in
the
seventeenth
century
she
was
the
first
to
set
the
fashion
in
france
of
that
long
series
of
social
gatherings
which
were
a
sort
of
institution
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
her
father
was
a
devoted
friend
of
henry
belonged
to
one
of
the
first
families
of
france
and
had
been
ambassador
to
rome
she
was
married
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
fifteen
when
she
had
acquired
a
distaste
for
the
dissipations
of
the
court
and
everything
like
crowded
assemblies
she
was
among
the
first
to
discover
that
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
does
not
constitute
society
nothing
is
more
foreign
to
the
genius
of
the
highest
cultivated
life
than
a
crowded
where
conversation
on
any
interesting
topic
is
impossible
where
social
life
is
gilded
but
frivolous
and
empty
where
especially
the
loftiest
sentiments
of
the
soul
are
suppressed
from
an
early
period
such
crowds
gathered
at
courts
but
it
was
not
till
the
seventeenth
century
that
the
arose
in
which
woman
was
a
queen
and
an
institution
the
famous
queens
of
society
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
do
not
seem
to
have
mixed
much
in
miscellaneous
assemblies
however
brilliant
in
dress
and
ornament
they
were
more
exclusive
they
reserved
their
remarkable
talents
for
social
reunions
perhaps
in
modest
where
among
distinguished
men
and
women
they
could
pour
out
the
treasures
of
the
soul
and
mind
where
they
could
inspire
and
draw
out
the
sentiments
of
those
who
were
gifted
and
distinguished
madame
du
deffand
lived
quietly
in
the
convent
of
joseph
but
she
gathered
around
her
an
elegant
and
famous
circle
until
she
was
eighty
and
blind
the
saturday
assemblies
of
mademoiselle
de
scudéry
frequented
by
the
most
distinguished
people
of
paris
were
given
in
a
modest
apartment
for
she
was
only
a
novelist
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
receptions
of
madame
de
la
sablière
who
was
a
childless
widow
of
moderate
means
the
duchesse
de
longueville
another
of
those
famous
queens
saw
her
best
days
in
the
abbey
of
port
royal
madame
récamier
reigned
in
a
small
apartment
in
the
all
these
carried
out
in
their
the
rules
and
customs
which
had
been
established
by
madame
de
rambouillet
it
was
in
her
that
the
french
academy
originated
and
its
first
members
were
regular
visitants
at
her
hotel
her
conversation
was
the
chief
amusement
we
hear
of
neither
cards
nor
music
but
there
were
frequent
parties
to
the
country
walks
in
the
woods
a
perpetual
animation
where
ceremony
was
banished
the
brilliancy
of
her
parties
excited
the
jealousy
of
richelieu
hither
resorted
those
who
did
not
wish
to
be
bound
by
the
stiffness
of
the
court
at
that
period
this
famous
hotel
had
its
pedantries
but
it
was
severely
intellectual
hither
came
mademoiselle
de
scudéri
mademoiselle
de
montpensier
granddaughter
of
henry
iv
vaugelas
and
others
of
the
poets
also
balzac
voiture
racan
the
duc
de
montausier
madame
de
sévigné
madame
de
la
fayette
and
others
the
most
marked
thing
about
this
hotel
was
the
patronage
extended
to
men
of
letters
those
great
french
ladies
welcomed
poets
and
scholars
and
encouraged
them
and
did
not
allow
them
to
starve
like
the
literary
men
of
grub
street
had
the
english
aristocracy
extended
the
same
helping
hand
to
authors
the
condition
of
english
men
of
letters
in
the
eighteenth
century
would
have
been
far
less
unfortunate
authors
in
france
have
never
been
excluded
from
high
society
and
this
was
owing
in
part
to
the
influence
of
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
which
sought
an
alliance
between
genius
and
rank
it
is
this
blending
of
genius
with
rank
which
gave
to
society
in
france
its
chief
attraction
and
made
it
so
brilliant
mademoiselle
de
scudéry
madame
de
la
sablière
and
madame
de
longueville
followed
the
precedents
established
by
madame
de
rambouillet
and
madame
de
maintenon
and
successively
reigned
as
queens
of
society
that
is
of
chosen
circles
of
those
who
were
most
celebrated
in
france
raising
the
intellectual
tone
of
society
and
inspiring
increased
veneration
for
woman
herself
but
the
most
celebrated
of
all
these
queens
of
society
was
madame
récamier
who
was
the
friend
and
contemporary
of
madame
de
staël
she
was
born
at
lyons
in
not
of
high
rank
her
father
bernard
being
only
a
prosperous
notary
through
the
influence
of
calonne
minister
of
louis
he
obtained
the
lucrative
place
of
receiver
of
the
finances
and
removed
to
paris
while
his
only
daughter
juliette
was
sent
to
a
convent
near
lyons
to
be
educated
where
she
remained
until
she
was
ten
years
of
age
when
she
rejoined
her
family
education
was
continued
at
home
under
her
mother
superintendence
but
she
excelled
in
nothing
especially
except
music
and
dancing
and
was
only
marked
for
grace
beauty
and
among
the
visitors
to
her
father
house
was
jacques
rose
récamier
a
rich
banker
born
in
lyons
hospitable
and
cultivated
but
of
frivolous
tastes
in
during
the
reign
of
terror
being
he
married
the
beautiful
daughter
of
his
friend
she
being
but
fifteen
this
marriage
seems
to
have
been
one
of
convenience
and
vanity
with
no
ties
of
love
on
either
side
scarcely
friendship
or
even
sentiment
for
a
few
years
madame
récamier
led
a
secluded
life
on
account
of
the
troubles
and
dangers
incident
to
the
times
but
when
she
did
emerge
from
retirement
she
had
developed
into
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
france
and
was
devoted
to
a
life
of
pleasure
her
figure
was
flexible
and
elegant
her
head
her
complexion
brilliant
with
a
little
rosy
mouth
pearly
teeth
black
curling
hair
and
soft
expressive
eyes
with
a
carriage
indicative
of
indolence
and
pride
yet
with
a
face
beaming
with
and
sympathy
such
was
madame
récamier
at
eighteen
so
remarkable
for
beauty
that
she
called
forth
murmurs
of
admiration
wherever
she
appeared
as
it
had
long
been
a
custom
in
paris
and
still
is
to
select
the
most
beautiful
and
winning
woman
to
hand
round
the
purse
in
churches
for
all
charities
she
was
selected
by
the
church
of
roche
the
most
fashionable
church
of
that
day
and
so
great
was
the
enthusiasm
to
see
this
beautiful
and
bewitching
creature
that
the
people
crowded
the
church
and
even
mounted
on
the
chairs
and
though
assisted
by
two
gentlemen
she
could
scarcely
penetrate
the
crowd
the
collection
on
one
occasion
amounted
to
twenty
thousand
francs
equal
perhaps
to
ten
thousand
dollars
this
adaptation
of
means
to
an
end
has
never
been
disdained
by
the
catholic
clergy
what
would
be
thought
in
philadelphia
or
new
york
in
an
austere
and
solemn
presbyterian
church
to
see
the
most
noted
beauty
of
the
day
handing
round
the
plate
but
such
is
one
of
the
forms
which
french
levity
takes
even
in
the
consecrated
precincts
of
the
church
the
fashionable
drive
and
promenade
in
paris
was
longchamps
now
the
champs
élysées
and
it
was
madame
récamier
delight
to
drive
in
an
open
carriage
on
this
beautiful
avenue
especially
on
what
are
called
the
holy
days
wednesdays
and
fridays
when
her
beauty
extorted
salutations
from
the
crowd
of
course
such
a
woman
excited
equal
admiration
in
the
and
was
soon
invited
to
the
fêtes
and
parties
of
the
directory
through
barras
one
of
her
admirers
there
she
saw
bonaparte
but
did
not
personally
know
him
at
that
time
at
one
of
these
fêtes
rising
at
full
length
from
her
seat
to
gaze
at
the
general
sharing
in
the
admiration
for
the
hero
she
at
once
attracted
the
notice
of
the
crowd
who
all
turned
to
look
at
her
which
so
annoyed
bonaparte
that
he
gave
her
one
of
his
dreadful
and
withering
frowns
which
caused
her
to
sink
into
her
seat
with
terror
in
récamier
bought
the
house
which
had
récamier
belonged
to
necker
in
what
is
now
the
chaussée
this
led
to
an
acquaintance
between
madame
récamier
and
madame
de
staël
which
soon
ripened
into
friendship
in
the
following
year
récamier
now
very
rich
established
himself
in
a
fine
chateau
at
clichy
a
short
distance
from
paris
where
he
kept
open
house
thither
came
lucien
bonaparte
at
that
time
years
of
age
bombastic
and
consequential
and
fell
in
love
with
his
beautiful
hostess
as
everybody
else
did
but
madame
récamier
with
all
her
fascinations
was
not
a
woman
of
passion
nor
did
she
like
the
brother
of
the
powerful
first
consul
and
politely
rejected
his
addresses
he
continued
however
to
persecute
her
with
his
absurd
for
a
year
when
finding
it
was
hopeless
to
win
so
refined
and
virtuous
a
lady
as
madame
récamier
doubtless
was
partly
because
she
was
a
woman
of
high
principles
and
partly
because
she
had
no
great
temptations
the
pompous
lover
then
home
minister
ceased
his
addresses
but
napoleon
who
knew
everything
that
was
going
on
had
a
curiosity
to
see
this
woman
who
charmed
everybody
yet
whom
nobody
could
win
and
she
was
invited
to
one
of
his
banquets
although
she
obeyed
his
summons
she
was
very
modest
and
timid
and
did
not
try
to
make
any
conquest
of
him
she
was
afraid
of
him
as
madame
de
staël
was
and
most
ladies
of
rank
and
refinement
he
was
a
hero
to
men
rather
than
to
women
at
least
to
those
women
who
happened
to
know
him
or
serve
him
that
cold
and
cutting
irony
of
which
he
was
master
that
haughty
carriage
and
air
which
he
assumed
that
selfish
and
unsympathetic
nature
that
exacting
slavery
to
his
will
must
have
been
intolerable
to
women
who
believed
in
affection
and
friendship
of
which
he
was
incapable
and
which
he
did
not
even
comprehend
it
was
his
intention
that
the
most
famous
beauty
of
the
day
should
sit
next
to
him
at
this
banquet
and
he
left
the
seat
vacant
for
her
but
she
was
too
modest
to
take
it
unless
specially
directed
to
do
so
by
the
consul
which
either
pride
or
etiquette
prevented
this
modesty
he
did
not
appreciate
and
he
was
offended
and
she
never
saw
him
again
in
private
but
after
he
became
emperor
he
made
every
effort
to
secure
her
services
as
to
one
of
the
princesses
through
his
minister
fouché
in
order
to
ornament
his
court
it
was
a
flattering
honor
since
she
was
only
the
wife
of
a
banker
without
title
but
she
refused
it
which
stung
napoleon
with
vexation
since
it
indicated
to
him
that
the
fashionable
and
women
of
the
day
stood
aloof
from
him
many
a
woman
was
banished
because
she
would
not
pay
court
to
him
madame
de
staël
the
duchesse
de
chevreuse
and
others
madame
récamier
was
now
at
the
height
of
fashion
admired
by
frenchmen
and
foreigners
alike
not
merely
by
such
men
as
the
montmorencys
narbonne
jordan
barrère
moreau
bernadotte
la
harpe
but
also
by
metternich
then
secretary
of
the
austrian
embassy
who
carried
on
a
flirtation
with
her
all
winter
all
this
was
displeasing
to
napoleon
more
from
wounded
pride
than
fear
of
treason
in
the
midst
of
her
social
triumphs
after
having
on
one
occasion
received
uncommon
honor
napoleon
now
emperor
bitterly
exclaimed
that
more
honor
could
not
be
shown
to
the
wife
of
a
marshal
of
france
a
remark
very
indicative
of
his
character
showing
that
in
his
estimation
there
was
no
possible
rank
or
fame
to
be
compared
with
the
laurels
of
a
military
hero
a
great
literary
genius
or
woman
of
transcendent
beauty
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
great
scholar
or
philosopher
is
to
a
vulgar
rich
man
in
making
up
his
parties
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
social
successes
that
the
husband
of
madame
récamier
lost
his
fortune
he
would
not
have
failed
had
he
been
able
to
secure
a
loan
from
the
bank
of
france
of
a
million
of
francs
but
this
loan
the
government
peremptorily
refused
doubtless
from
the
hostility
of
napoleon
so
that
the
banker
was
ruined
because
his
wife
chose
to
ally
herself
with
the
old
aristocracy
and
refuse
the
favors
of
the
emperor
in
having
pursued
such
a
course
madame
récamier
must
have
known
that
she
was
the
indirect
cause
of
her
husband
failure
but
she
bore
the
reverse
of
fortune
with
that
equanimity
which
seems
to
be
peculiar
to
the
french
and
which
only
lofty
characters
or
people
of
considerable
mental
resources
are
able
to
assume
or
feel
most
rich
men
when
they
lose
their
money
give
way
to
despondency
and
grief
conscious
that
they
have
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
that
without
money
they
are
nothing
madame
récamier
at
once
sold
her
jewels
and
plate
and
her
fine
hotel
was
offered
for
sale
neither
she
nor
her
husband
sought
to
retain
anything
amid
the
wreck
and
they
cheerfully
took
up
their
abode
in
a
small
apartment
which
conduct
won
universal
sympathy
and
respect
so
that
her
friends
were
rather
increased
than
diminished
and
she
did
not
lose
her
social
prestige
and
influence
which
she
would
have
lost
in
cities
where
money
is
the
highest
and
sometimes
the
only
test
of
social
position
madame
de
staël
wrote
letters
of
impassioned
friendship
and
nobles
and
generals
paid
unwonted
attention
the
death
of
her
mother
soon
followed
so
that
she
spent
the
summer
of
in
extreme
privacy
until
persuaded
by
her
constant
friend
madame
de
staël
to
pay
her
a
visit
at
her
near
geneva
where
she
met
prince
frederick
of
prussia
nephew
of
the
great
frederic
who
became
so
enamored
of
her
that
he
sought
her
hand
in
marriage
princes
in
those
days
had
such
a
lofty
idea
of
their
rank
that
they
deemed
it
an
honor
to
be
conferred
on
a
woman
even
if
married
to
take
her
away
from
her
husband
for
a
time
madame
récamier
seemed
dazzled
with
this
splendid
proposal
and
she
even
wrote
to
the
old
banker
her
husband
asking
for
a
divorce
from
him
i
think
i
never
read
of
a
request
so
preposterous
or
more
disgraceful
the
greatest
flaw
i
know
in
her
character
showing
the
extreme
worldliness
of
women
of
fashion
at
that
time
and
the
audacity
which
is
created
by
universal
flattery
what
is
even
more
surprising
her
husband
did
not
refuse
the
request
but
wrote
to
her
a
letter
of
so
much
dignity
tenderness
and
affection
that
her
eyes
were
opened
she
saw
the
protector
of
her
youth
whose
indulgence
had
never
failed
her
growing
old
and
despoiled
of
fortune
and
to
leave
him
who
had
been
so
good
to
her
even
if
she
did
not
love
him
seemed
rightly
the
height
of
ingratitude
and
meanness
so
the
prince
was
dismissed
very
much
to
his
surprise
and
chagrin
and
some
there
were
who
regarded
récamier
as
a
very
selfish
man
to
appeal
to
the
feelings
and
honor
of
his
wife
and
thus
deprive
her
of
a
splendid
destiny
such
were
the
morals
of
fashionable
people
in
europe
during
the
eighteenth
century
madame
récamier
did
not
meddle
with
politics
like
madame
de
staël
and
other
women
before
and
since
but
her
friendship
with
a
woman
whom
napoleon
hated
so
intensely
as
he
did
the
authoress
of
delphine
and
germany
caused
her
banishment
to
a
distance
of
forty
leagues
from
paris
one
of
the
customary
acts
which
the
great
conqueror
was
not
ashamed
to
commit
and
which
put
his
character
in
a
repulsive
light
nothing
was
more
odious
in
the
character
of
napoleon
than
his
disdain
of
women
and
his
harsh
and
severe
treatment
of
those
who
would
not
offer
incense
to
him
madame
de
staël
on
learning
of
the
resentment
towards
her
friend
implored
her
not
to
continue
to
visit
her
as
it
would
certainly
be
reported
to
the
government
and
result
in
her
banishment
but
madame
récamier
would
obey
the
impulses
of
friendship
in
the
face
of
all
danger
and
the
result
was
indeed
her
exile
from
that
city
which
was
so
dear
to
her
as
well
as
to
all
fashionable
women
and
all
gifted
men
in
exile
this
persecuted
woman
lived
in
a
simple
way
first
at
chalons
and
then
at
lyons
for
her
means
were
now
small
her
companions
however
were
great
people
as
before
her
banishment
and
in
the
days
of
her
prosperity
in
which
fact
we
see
some
modification
of
the
heartlessness
which
so
often
reigns
in
fashionable
circles
madame
récamier
never
was
without
friends
as
well
as
admirers
her
amiability
wit
and
extraordinary
fascinations
always
attracted
gifted
and
accomplished
people
of
the
very
highest
rank
it
was
at
lyons
that
she
formed
a
singular
friendship
which
lasted
for
life
and
this
was
with
a
young
man
of
plebeian
origin
the
son
of
a
printer
with
a
face
disfigured
and
with
manners
uncouth
ballanche
whose
admiration
amounted
to
absolute
idolatry
and
who
demanded
no
other
reward
for
his
devotion
than
the
privilege
of
worship
to
be
permitted
to
look
at
her
and
listen
to
her
was
enough
for
him
though
ugly
in
appearance
and
with
a
slow
speech
he
was
well
versed
in
the
literature
of
the
day
and
his
ideas
were
lofty
and
refined
i
have
never
read
of
any
one
who
has
refused
an
unselfish
idolatry
the
incense
of
a
worshipper
who
has
no
outward
advantage
to
seek
or
gain
not
even
a
king
if
it
be
the
privilege
of
a
divinity
to
receive
the
homage
of
worshippers
why
should
a
beautiful
and
woman
reject
the
respectful
adoration
of
a
man
contented
with
worship
alone
what
could
be
more
flattering
even
to
a
woman
of
the
world
especially
if
this
man
had
noble
traits
and
great
cultivation
such
was
ballanche
who
viewed
the
mistress
of
his
heart
as
dante
did
his
beatrice
though
not
with
the
same
sublime
elevation
for
the
object
of
dante
devotion
was
on
the
whole
imaginary
the
worship
of
qualities
which
existed
in
his
own
mind
alone
whereas
the
admiration
of
ballanche
was
based
on
the
real
presence
of
flesh
and
blood
animated
by
a
lovely
soul
soon
after
this
friendship
had
begun
madame
récamier
made
a
visit
to
italy
travelling
in
a
not
a
private
carriage
and
arrived
at
rome
in
passion
week
when
the
pope
was
a
prisoner
of
napoleon
at
fontainebleau
and
hence
when
his
capital
was
in
mourning
sad
and
dull
guarded
and
occupied
by
french
soldiers
the
only
society
at
rome
in
that
eventful
year
which
preceded
the
declining
fortunes
of
napoleon
was
at
the
palace
of
prince
torlonia
the
banker
but
the
modest
apartment
of
madame
récamier
on
the
corso
was
soon
filled
with
those
who
detested
the
rule
of
napoleon
soon
after
ballanche
came
all
the
way
from
lyons
to
see
his
star
of
worship
and
she
kindly
took
him
everywhere
for
even
in
desolation
the
eternal
city
is
the
most
interesting
spot
on
the
face
of
the
globe
from
rome
she
went
to
naples
december
when
the
king
murat
was
forced
into
the
coalition
against
his
in
spite
of
the
hatred
of
napoleon
his
sister
the
queen
of
naples
was
devoted
to
the
queen
of
beauty
who
was
received
at
court
as
an
ambassadress
rather
than
as
an
exile
on
the
fall
of
napoleon
the
next
year
the
pope
returned
from
his
thraldom
and
madame
récamier
being
again
in
rome
witnessed
one
of
the
most
touching
scenes
of
those
eventful
days
when
all
the
nobles
and
gentry
went
out
to
meet
their
spiritual
and
temporal
sovereign
and
amid
the
exultant
shouts
and
rapture
of
the
crowd
dragged
his
gilded
carriage
to
peter
church
where
was
celebrated
a
solemn
but
madame
récamier
did
not
tarry
long
in
italy
she
hastened
back
to
paris
for
the
tyrant
was
fallen
she
was
now
no
longer
beaming
in
youthful
charms
with
groups
of
lovers
at
her
feet
but
a
woman
of
middle
age
yet
still
handsome
for
such
a
woman
does
not
lose
her
beauty
at
with
fresh
sources
of
enjoyment
and
a
keen
desire
for
the
society
of
intellectual
and
gifted
friends
she
now
gave
up
miscellaneous
society
that
is
fashionable
and
dissipated
crowds
of
men
and
women
in
noisy
receptions
and
ceremonious
parties
and
drew
around
her
the
lines
of
a
more
exclusive
circle
hither
came
to
see
her
ballanche
now
a
resident
of
paris
mathieu
de
montmorency
de
châteaubriand
the
due
de
broglie
and
the
most
distinguished
nobles
of
the
ancient
regime
with
the
literary
lions
who
once
more
began
to
roar
on
the
fall
of
the
tyrant
who
had
silenced
them
including
such
men
as
barante
and
benjamin
constant
also
great
ladies
were
seen
in
her
for
her
husband
fortunes
had
improved
and
she
was
enabled
again
to
live
in
her
old
style
of
splendor
among
these
ladies
were
the
duchesse
de
cars
the
marchionesses
de
podences
castellan
and
and
the
of
sweden
also
distinguished
foreigners
sought
her
society
wellington
madame
krüdener
the
friend
of
the
emperor
alexander
the
beautiful
duchess
of
devonshire
the
duke
of
hamilton
and
whoever
was
most
distinguished
in
that
brilliant
circle
of
illustrious
people
who
congregated
at
paris
on
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
in
occurred
the
second
failure
of
récamier
which
necessarily
led
again
to
a
new
and
more
humble
style
of
life
the
home
which
madame
récamier
now
selected
and
where
she
lived
until
was
the
while
her
father
and
her
husband
the
latter
now
lived
in
a
small
lodging
in
the
vicinity
she
occupied
in
this
convent
a
large
old
building
in
the
rue
de
sèvres
a
small
in
the
third
story
with
a
brick
floor
and
uneven
at
that
she
afterwards
removed
to
a
small
on
the
first
floor
which
looked
upon
the
convent
garden
here
in
this
seclusion
impoverished
and
no
longer
young
madame
récamier
received
her
friends
and
guests
and
they
were
among
the
most
distinguished
people
of
france
especially
the
duc
de
montmorency
and
the
viscount
châteaubriand
the
former
was
a
very
religious
man
and
the
breath
of
scandal
never
for
a
moment
tainted
his
reputation
or
cast
any
reproach
on
the
memorable
friendship
which
he
cultivated
with
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
france
this
illustrious
nobleman
was
at
that
time
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
was
sent
to
the
celebrated
congress
of
vienna
where
metternich
the
greatest
statesman
of
the
age
presided
and
inaugurated
a
reaction
from
the
principles
of
the
revolution
but
more
famous
than
he
was
châteaubriand
then
ambassador
at
london
and
afterwards
joined
with
montmorency
as
delegate
to
the
congress
of
vienna
and
still
later
minister
of
foreign
affairs
who
held
during
the
reign
of
louis
xviii
the
most
distinguished
position
in
france
as
a
statesman
a
man
of
society
and
a
literary
man
the
author
of
the
genius
of
christianity
was
aristocratic
moody
fickle
and
vain
almost
spoiled
with
the
incense
of
popular
idolatry
no
literary
man
since
voltaire
had
received
such
incense
he
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
french
literature
a
man
of
illustrious
birth
noble
manners
poetical
temperament
vast
acquisitions
and
immense
social
prestige
he
took
sad
and
desponding
views
of
life
was
intensely
conservative
but
had
doubtless
a
lofty
soul
as
well
as
intellectual
supremacy
he
occupied
distinct
spheres
was
poet
historian
statesman
orator
and
the
oracle
of
fashionable
although
he
loved
seclusion
and
detested
crowds
the
virtues
of
his
private
life
were
unimpeached
and
no
man
was
more
respected
by
the
nation
than
this
cultivated
scholar
and
gentleman
of
the
old
school
it
was
between
this
remarkable
man
and
madame
récamier
that
the
most
memorable
friendship
of
modern
times
took
place
it
began
in
the
year
at
the
bedside
of
madame
de
staël
but
did
not
ripen
into
intimacy
until
when
he
was
fifty
and
she
was
his
genius
and
accomplishments
soon
conquered
the
first
place
in
her
heart
and
he
kept
that
place
until
his
death
in
thirty
years
of
ardent
and
reproachless
friendship
her
other
friends
felt
great
inquietude
in
view
of
this
friendship
fearing
that
the
incurable
melancholy
and
fitful
moods
of
the
viscount
would
have
a
depressing
influence
on
her
but
she
could
not
resist
his
fascinations
any
easier
than
he
could
resist
hers
the
viscount
visited
her
every
day
generally
in
the
afternoon
and
when
absent
on
his
diplomatic
missions
to
the
various
foreign
courts
he
wrote
her
every
day
all
the
details
of
his
life
as
well
as
sentiments
he
constantly
complained
that
she
did
not
write
as
often
as
he
did
his
attachment
was
not
prompted
by
that
unselfish
devotion
which
marked
ballanche
who
sought
no
return
only
the
privilege
of
adoration
châteaubriand
was
exacting
and
sought
a
warmer
and
still
increasing
affection
which
it
seems
was
returned
madame
récamier
nature
was
not
passionate
it
was
simply
affectionate
she
sought
to
have
the
wants
of
her
soul
met
she
rarely
went
to
parties
or
assemblies
and
seldom
to
the
theatre
she
craved
friendship
and
of
the
purest
and
loftiest
kind
she
was
tired
of
the
dissipation
of
society
and
even
of
flatteries
of
which
the
viscount
was
equally
weary
the
delusions
of
life
were
dispelled
in
her
case
at
forty
in
his
at
fifty
this
intimacy
reminds
us
of
that
of
louis
xiv
and
madame
de
maintenon
neither
could
live
without
the
other
but
their
correspondence
does
not
reveal
any
improper
intimacy
it
was
purely
spiritual
and
affectionate
it
was
based
on
mutual
admiration
it
was
strengthened
by
mutual
respect
for
each
other
moral
qualities
and
the
friendship
gave
rise
to
no
scandal
nor
was
it
in
any
way
misrepresented
every
day
the
statesman
when
immersed
even
in
the
cares
of
a
great
office
was
seen
at
her
modest
dwelling
at
the
same
hour
about
four
and
no
other
visitors
were
received
at
that
hour
after
unbending
his
burdened
soul
or
communicating
his
political
plans
or
detailing
the
gossip
of
the
day
all
to
the
end
of
securing
sympathy
and
encouragement
from
a
great
woman
he
retired
to
his
own
hotel
and
spent
the
evening
with
his
sick
wife
one
might
suppose
that
his
wife
would
have
been
jealous
the
wife
of
carlyle
never
would
have
permitted
her
husband
to
visit
on
such
intimate
terms
the
woman
he
most
admired
lady
ashburton
without
a
separation
but
châteaubriand
wife
favored
rather
than
discouraged
the
intimacy
knowing
that
it
was
necessary
to
his
happiness
nor
did
the
friendship
between
madame
récamier
and
the
due
de
montmorency
the
political
rival
of
châteaubriand
weaken
the
love
of
the
latter
or
create
jealousy
a
proof
of
his
noble
character
and
when
the
pious
duke
died
both
friends
gave
way
to
the
most
sincere
grief
it
was
impossible
for
madame
récamier
to
live
without
friendship
she
could
give
up
society
and
fortune
but
not
her
friends
the
friendly
circle
was
not
large
but
as
we
have
said
embraced
the
leading
men
of
france
her
limited
means
made
no
difference
with
her
guests
since
these
were
friends
and
admirers
her
attraction
to
men
and
women
alike
did
not
decrease
with
age
or
poverty
the
fall
of
charles
in
led
of
course
to
the
political
downfall
of
châteaubriand
and
of
many
of
madame
récamier
best
friends
but
there
was
a
younger
class
of
an
opposite
school
who
now
came
forward
and
the
more
eminent
of
these
were
also
frequent
visitors
to
the
old
queen
of
society
ampère
thiers
mignet
guizot
de
tocqueville
nor
did
she
lose
the
friendship
in
her
altered
fortunes
of
queens
and
nobles
she
seems
to
have
been
received
with
the
greatest
cordiality
in
whatever
chateau
she
chose
to
visit
even
louis
napoleon
on
his
release
from
imprisonment
in
the
castle
of
ham
lost
no
time
in
paying
his
respects
to
the
woman
his
uncle
had
formerly
banished
one
of
the
characteristic
things
which
this
interesting
lady
did
was
to
get
up
a
soiree
in
her
apartments
at
the
convent
in
aid
of
the
sufferers
of
lyons
from
an
inundation
of
the
rhône
from
which
she
realized
a
large
sum
it
was
attended
by
the
of
paris
lady
byron
paid
a
hundred
francs
for
her
ticket
the
due
de
noailles
provided
the
refreshments
the
marquis
de
verac
furnished
the
carriages
and
châteaubriand
acted
as
master
of
ceremonies
rachel
acted
in
the
rôle
of
esther
not
yet
performed
at
the
theatre
while
garcia
rubini
and
lablache
kindly
gave
their
services
it
was
a
very
brilliant
entertainment
one
of
the
last
in
which
madame
récamier
presided
as
a
queen
of
society
it
showed
her
kindness
of
heart
which
was
the
most
conspicuous
trait
of
her
character
she
wished
to
please
but
she
desired
still
more
to
be
of
assistance
the
desire
to
please
may
arise
from
blended
vanity
and
the
desire
to
be
useful
is
purely
disinterested
in
all
her
intercourse
with
friends
we
see
in
madame
récamier
a
remarkable
power
of
sympathy
she
was
not
a
woman
of
genius
but
of
amazing
tact
kindness
and
amiability
she
entered
with
all
her
heart
into
the
private
and
confidential
communications
of
her
friends
and
was
totally
free
from
egotism
forgetting
herself
in
the
happiness
of
others
if
not
a
woman
of
genius
she
had
extraordinary
good
sense
and
her
advice
was
seldom
wrong
it
was
this
union
of
sympathy
kindness
tact
and
wisdom
which
made
madame
récamier
friendship
so
highly
prized
by
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
but
she
was
exclusive
she
did
not
admit
everybody
to
her
salon
only
those
whom
she
loved
and
esteemed
generally
from
the
highest
social
circle
sympathy
can
not
exist
except
among
equals
we
associate
paula
with
jerome
the
countess
matilda
with
hildebrand
vittoria
colonna
with
michael
angelo
hannah
more
with
johnson
friendship
is
neither
patronage
nor
philanthropy
and
the
more
exalted
the
social
or
political
or
literary
position
the
more
rare
friendship
is
and
the
more
beautiful
when
it
shines
it
was
the
friendships
of
madame
récamier
with
distinguished
men
and
women
which
made
her
famous
more
than
her
graces
and
beauty
she
soothed
encouraged
and
fortified
the
soul
of
châteaubriand
in
his
fits
of
depression
and
under
political
disappointments
always
herself
cheerful
and
full
of
vivacity
an
angel
of
consolation
and
spiritual
radiance
her
beauty
at
this
period
was
moral
rather
than
physical
since
it
revealed
the
virtues
of
the
heart
and
the
quickness
of
spiritual
insight
in
her
earlier
days
the
object
of
universal
and
unbounded
admiration
from
her
unparalleled
charms
and
fascinations
she
may
have
coquetted
more
than
can
be
deemed
decorous
in
a
lady
of
fashion
but
if
so
it
was
vanity
and
love
of
admiration
which
were
the
causes
she
never
appealed
to
passion
for
as
we
have
said
her
own
nature
was
not
passionate
she
was
satisfied
to
be
worshipped
the
love
of
admiration
is
not
often
allied
with
that
passion
which
loses
and
buries
one
in
the
gulf
of
mad
infatuation
the
mainspring
of
her
early
life
was
to
please
and
of
her
later
life
to
make
people
happy
a
more
unselfish
woman
never
lived
those
beauties
who
lure
to
ruin
as
did
the
sirens
are
ever
heartless
and
selfish
like
cleopatra
and
madame
de
pompadour
there
is
nothing
on
this
earth
more
selfish
than
what
foolish
and
inexperienced
people
often
mistake
for
love
there
is
nothing
more
radiant
and
inspiring
than
the
moral
beauty
of
the
soul
the
love
that
this
creates
is
tender
sympathetic
kind
and
benevolent
nothing
could
be
more
unselfish
and
beautiful
than
the
love
with
which
madame
récamier
inspired
ballanche
who
had
nothing
to
give
and
nothing
to
ask
but
sympathy
and
kindness
one
of
the
most
touching
and
tender
friendships
ever
recorded
was
the
intercourse
between
châteaubriand
and
madame
récamier
when
they
were
both
old
and
infirm
nothing
is
more
interesting
than
their
letters
and
daily
interviews
at
the
convent
where
she
spent
her
latter
days
she
was
not
only
poor
but
she
had
also
become
blind
and
had
lost
all
relish
for
fashionable
society
not
a
religious
recluse
saddened
and
penitent
like
the
duchesse
de
longueville
in
the
vale
of
chevreuse
but
still
a
cheerful
woman
fond
of
music
of
animated
talk
and
of
the
political
news
of
the
day
châteaubriand
was
old
disenchanted
disappointed
melancholy
and
full
of
infirmities
yet
he
never
failed
in
the
afternoon
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
abbaye
driven
in
a
carriage
to
the
threshold
of
the
salon
where
he
was
placed
in
an
and
wheeled
to
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
when
he
poured
out
his
sorrows
and
received
consolation
once
on
one
of
those
dreary
visits
he
asked
his
friend
to
marry
him
he
being
then
and
she
and
bear
his
illustrious
name
why
said
she
should
we
marry
at
our
age
there
is
no
impropriety
in
my
taking
care
of
you
if
solitude
is
painful
to
you
i
am
ready
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
you
the
world
will
do
justice
to
the
purity
of
our
friendship
years
and
blindness
give
me
this
right
let
us
change
nothing
in
so
perfect
an
affection
the
old
statesman
and
historian
soon
after
died
broken
in
mind
and
body
living
long
enough
to
see
the
fall
of
louis
philippe
in
losing
this
friend
of
thirty
years
madame
récamier
felt
that
the
mainspring
of
her
life
was
broken
she
shed
no
tears
in
her
silent
and
submissive
grief
nor
did
she
repel
consolation
or
the
society
of
friends
but
the
sad
smile
which
played
on
her
lips
was
while
witnessing
the
decline
of
this
noble
genius
she
had
struggled
with
singular
tenderness
against
the
terrible
effect
of
years
upon
him
but
the
long
struggle
had
exhausted
her
own
strength
and
all
motives
for
life
were
gone
though
now
old
and
blind
yet
like
mme
du
deffand
at
eighty
madame
récamier
attractions
never
passed
away
the
great
and
the
distinguished
still
visited
her
and
pronounced
her
charming
to
the
last
her
vivacity
never
deserted
her
nor
her
desire
to
make
every
one
happy
around
her
she
was
kept
interesting
to
the
end
by
the
warmth
of
her
affections
and
the
brightness
of
her
mind
as
it
is
the
soul
which
is
the
glory
of
a
woman
so
the
soul
sheds
its
rays
of
imperishable
light
on
the
last
pathway
of
existence
no
beauty
ever
utterly
passes
away
when
animated
by
what
is
immortal
madame
récamier
died
at
last
of
cholera
that
disease
which
of
all
others
she
had
ever
most
dreaded
and
avoided
on
the
of
may
amid
weeping
relatives
and
kneeling
servants
and
sacerdotal
prayers
this
interesting
woman
passed
away
from
earth
to
her
might
be
applied
the
eulogy
of
burke
on
marie
antoinette
madame
récamier
place
in
society
has
never
since
been
filled
with
equal
grace
and
fascination
she
adopted
the
customs
of
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
certain
rules
which
good
society
has
since
observed
she
discouraged
the
in
a
low
voice
in
a
mixed
company
if
any
one
in
her
circle
was
likely
to
have
especial
knowledge
she
would
appeal
to
him
with
an
air
of
deference
if
any
one
was
shy
she
encouraged
him
if
a
was
particularly
happy
she
would
take
it
up
and
show
it
to
the
company
presiding
in
her
own
she
talked
but
little
herself
but
rather
exerted
herself
to
draw
others
out
without
being
learned
she
exercised
great
judgment
in
her
decisions
when
appeals
were
made
to
her
as
the
presiding
genius
she
discouraged
everything
pedantic
and
pretentious
she
dreaded
exaggerations
she
kept
her
company
to
the
subject
under
discussion
and
compelled
attention
she
would
allow
no
slang
she
insisted
upon
and
amiability
which
more
than
anything
else
marked
society
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
read
so
much
of
those
interesting
reunions
in
the
of
distinguished
people
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
that
we
naturally
seek
to
know
what
constituted
their
peculiar
charm
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
conversation
which
is
both
an
art
and
a
gift
in
these
exclusive
meetings
women
did
not
reign
in
consequence
of
their
beauty
so
much
as
their
wit
their
vivacity
intelligence
and
tact
i
may
add
also
their
were
a
veil
to
cover
up
all
eccentricities
it
was
when
madame
du
deffand
was
eighty
and
blind
that
horace
walpole
pronounced
her
to
be
the
most
interesting
woman
in
france
madame
de
staël
never
beautiful
was
the
life
of
a
party
at
madame
récamier
was
in
her
glory
at
fifty
hannah
more
was
most
sought
when
she
was
sixty
there
can
be
no
high
society
where
conversation
is
not
the
chief
attraction
and
men
seldom
learn
to
talk
well
when
not
inspired
by
gifted
women
they
may
dictate
like
johnson
or
preach
like
coleridge
in
a
circle
of
admirers
or
give
vent
to
sarcasms
and
paradoxes
like
carlyle
but
they
do
not
please
like
horace
walpole
or
dazzle
like
wilkes
or
charm
like
mackintosh
when
society
was
most
famous
at
paris
it
was
the
salon
not
the
card
table
or
the
banquet
or
the
ball
which
was
most
sought
by
cultivated
men
and
women
where
conversation
was
directed
by
gifted
women
women
are
nothing
in
the
social
circle
who
can
not
draw
out
the
sentiments
of
able
men
and
a
man
of
genius
gains
more
from
the
inspiration
of
one
brilliant
woman
than
from
all
the
bookworms
of
many
colleges
in
society
a
bright
and
witty
woman
not
merely
shines
but
she
reigns
conversation
brings
out
all
her
faculties
and
kindles
all
her
sensibilities
and
gives
expression
to
her
deepest
sentiments
her
talk
is
more
than
music
it
is
music
rising
to
the
heights
of
eloquence
she
is
more
even
than
an
artist
she
is
a
goddess
before
whom
genius
delights
to
burn
its
incense
success
in
this
great
art
of
conversation
depends
as
much
upon
the
disposition
as
upon
the
brains
the
remarkable
women
who
reigned
in
the
salons
of
the
last
century
were
all
distinguished
for
their
based
on
toleration
and
kind
feeling
rather
than
on
insipid
acquiescence
there
can
be
no
animated
talk
without
dissent
and
dissent
should
be
disguised
by
the
language
of
courtesy
as
vanity
is
one
of
the
mainsprings
of
human
nature
and
is
nearly
universal
the
old
queens
of
society
had
the
tact
to
hide
what
could
not
easily
be
extirpated
and
they
were
adepts
in
the
still
greater
art
of
seeming
to
be
unconscious
those
people
are
ever
the
most
agreeable
who
listen
with
seeming
curiosity
and
who
conceal
themselves
in
order
to
feed
the
vanity
of
others
nor
does
a
true
artist
force
his
wit
a
confirmed
punster
is
as
great
a
bore
as
a
patronizing
moralist
moreover
the
life
of
society
depends
upon
the
general
glow
of
the
party
rather
than
the
prominence
of
an
individual
so
that
a
brilliant
talker
will
seek
to
bring
out
the
coincidence
which
strengthens
conviction
or
the
dissent
which
sharpens
sagacity
rather
than
individual
experiences
which
ever
seem
to
be
egotistical
in
agreeable
society
all
egotism
is
to
be
crushed
and
crucified
even
a
man
who
is
an
oracle
if
wise
will
suggest
rather
than
seem
to
instruct
in
a
congenial
party
all
differences
in
rank
are
for
the
time
ignored
it
is
in
bad
taste
to
remind
or
impress
people
with
a
sense
of
their
inferiority
as
in
chivalry
all
degrees
were
forgotten
in
an
assemblage
of
gentlemen
animated
conversation
amuses
without
seeming
to
teach
and
transfers
ideas
so
skilfully
into
the
minds
of
others
that
they
are
ignorant
of
the
debt
and
mistake
them
for
their
own
it
kindles
a
healthy
enthusiasm
promotes
repels
pretension
and
rebukes
vanity
it
even
sets
off
beauty
and
intensifies
its
radiance
said

your
varying
expression
so
brightens
and
adorns
your
beauty
that
there
is
nothing
so
brilliant
as
yourself
every

you
utter
adds
to
the
brightness
of
your

and
while
it
is

that

impresses
only
the

it
is
quite
certain
that
yours
enchants
the

at

of
the
poet
scarron
we
can
not
easily
overrate
the
influence
of
those
who
inspire
the
social
circle
they
give
not
only
the
greatest
pleasure
which
is
known
to
cultivated
minds
but
kindle
lofty
sentiments
they
draw
men
from
the
whirlpools
of
folly
break
up
degrading
habits
dissipate
the
charms
of
and
raise
the
value
of
the
soul
how
charming
how
delightful
how
inspiring
is
the
eloquence
which
is
kindled
by
the
attrition
of
gifted
minds
what
privilege
is
greater
than
to
be
with
those
who
reveal
the
experiences
of
great
careers
especially
if
there
be
the
absence
of
vanity
and
ostentation
and
encouragement
by
those
whose
presence
is
safety
and
whose
smiles
are
an
inspiration
it
is
the
blending
of
the
beatitudes
of
bethany
with
the
artistic
enjoyments
of
weimar
causing
the
favored
circle
to
forget
all
cares
and
giving
them
strength
for
those
duties
which
make
up
the
main
business
of
human
life
when
woman
accomplishes
such
results
she
fills
no
ordinary
sphere
she
performs
no
ordinary
mission
she
rises
in
dignity
as
she
declines
in
physical
attractions
like
a
queen
of
beauty
at
the
tournament
she
bestows
the
rewards
which
distinguished
excellence
has
won
she
breaks
up
the
distinctions
of
rank
she
rebukes
the
arrogance
of
wealth
she
destroys
pretensions
she
kills
she
even
gains
consideration
for
her
husband
or
brother
for
many
a
stupid
man
is
received
into
a
select
circle
because
of
the
attractions
of
his
wife
or
sister
even
as
many
a
silly
woman
gains
consideration
from
the
talents
or
position
of
her
husband
or
brother
no
matter
how
rich
a
man
may
be
if
unpolished
ignorant
or
rude
he
is
nobody
in
a
party
which
seeks
the
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
he
is
utterly
insignificant
rebuked
and
humiliated
even
as
a
brainless
beauty
finds
herself
in
a
circle
of
wits
such
a
man
may
have
consideration
in
the
circle
which
can
not
appreciate
anything
lofty
or
refined
but
none
in
those
upper
regions
where
art
and
truth
form
subjects
of
discourse
where
the
aesthetic
influences
of
the
heart
go
forth
to
purify
and
exalt
where
the
soul
is
refreshed
by
the
communion
of
gifted
and
sympathetic
companions
and
where
that
which
is
most
precious
and
exalted
in
a
man
or
woman
is
honored
and
beloved
without
this
influence
which
woman
controls
a
learned
man
is
in
danger
of
becoming
a
pedant
a
religious
man
a
bigot
a
vain
man
a
fool
and
a
man
a
slave
no
man
can
be
truly
genial
unless
he
has
been
taught
in
the
school
where
his
wife
or
daughter
or
sister
or
mother
presides
as
a
sun
of
radiance
and
beauty
it
is
only
in
this
school
that
boorish
manners
are
reformed
egotisms
rebuked
stupidities
punished
and
cynicism
exorcised
but
this
exalting
influence
can
not
exist
in
society
without
an
attractive
power
in
those
ladies
who
compose
it
a
crowd
of
women
does
not
necessarily
make
society
any
more
than
do
the
empty
stupid
and
noisy
receptions
which
are
sometimes
held
in
the
houses
of
the
rich
still
less
those
silly
flippant
ignorant
pretentious
unblushing
and
exacting
girls
who
have
just
escaped
from
a
fashionable
school
who
elbow
their
brothers
into
corners
and
cover
with
confusion
their
fathers
and
mothers
a
mere
assemblage
of
men
and
women
is
nothing
without
the
charms
of
refinement
vivacity
knowledge
and
these
are
not
born
in
a
day
they
seldom
mark
people
till
middle
life
when
experiences
are
wide
and
feelings
deep
when
flippancy
is
not
mistaken
for
wit
nor
impertinence
for
ease
a
frivolous
slave
of
dress
and
ornament
can
no
more
belong
to
the
circle
of
which
i
now
speak
than
can
a
pushing
masculine
woman
to
the
sphere
which
she
occasionally
usurps
not
dress
not
jewelry
not
pleasing
manners
not
even
innocence
is
the
charm
and
glory
of
society
but
the
wisdom
learned
by
experience
the
knowledge
acquired
by
study
the
quickness
based
on
native
genius
when
woman
has
thus
acquired
these
great
resources
by
books
by
travel
by
extended
intercourse
and
by
the
soaring
of
an
untrammelled
soul
then
only
does
she
shine
and
guide
and
inspire
and
become
not
the
equal
of
man
but
his
superior
his
mentor
his
guardian
angel
his
star
of
worship
in
that
favored
and
glorious
realm
which
is
alike

and

madame
de

woman
in
literature
it
was
two
hundred
years
after
woman
began
to
reign
in
the
great
cities
of
europe
as
queen
of
society
before
she
astonished
the
world
by
brilliant
literary
successes
some
of
the
most
famous
women
who
adorned
society
recorded
their
observations
and
experiences
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
but
these
productions
were
generally
in
the
form
of
memoirs
and
letters
which
neither
added
to
nor
detracted
from
the
splendid
position
they
occupied
because
of
their
high
birth
wit
and
social
fascinations
these
earlier
favorites
were
not
courted
by
the
great
because
they
could
write
but
because
they
could
talk
and
adorn
courts
like
madame
de
sévigné
but
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
class
of
women
arose
and
gained
great
celebrity
on
account
of
their
writings
like
hannah
more
miss
burney
macaulay
madame
dacier
madame
de
la
fayette
women
who
proved
that
they
could
do
something
more
than
merely
write
letters
for
which
women
ever
have
been
distinguished
from
the
time
of
héloïse
at
the
head
of
all
these
women
of
genius
madame
de
staël
stands
not
only
over
literary
women
but
also
over
most
of
the
men
of
letters
in
her
age
and
country
and
it
was
only
a
great
age
which
could
have
produced
such
a
woman
for
the
eighteenth
century
was
more
fruitful
in
literary
genius
than
is
generally
supposed
the
greatest
lights
indeed
no
longer
shone
such
men
as
shakspeare
bacon
milton
corneille
racine
boileau
molière
but
the
age
was
fruitful
in
great
critics
historians
philosophers
economists
poets
and
novelists
who
won
immortal
fame
like
pope
goldsmith
johnson
addison
gibbon
bentley
hume
robertson
priestley
burke
adam

in
england
klopstock

and
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
marmontel
montesquieu
rollin
buffon
lavoisier
raynal
lavater
in
france
all
of
whom
were
remarkable
men
casting
their
fearless
glance
upon
all
subjects
and
agitating
the
age
by
their
great
ideas
in
france
especially
there
was
a
notable
literary
awakening
a
more
brilliant
circle
than
ever
assembled
at
the
hôtel
de
rambouillet
met
in
the
salons
of
madame
geoffrin
and
madame
de
tencin
and
madame
du
deffand
and
madame
necker
to
discuss
theories
of
government
political
economy
human
rights
in
fact
every
question
which
moves
the
human
mind
they
were
generally
irreligious
satirical
and
defiant
but
they
were
fresh
enthusiastic
learned
and
original
they
not
only
aroused
the
people
to
reflection
but
they
were
great
artists
in
language
and
made
a
revolution
in
style
it
was
in
this
inquiring
brilliant
yet
infidel
age
that
the
star
of
madame
de
staël
arose
on
the
eve
of
the
french
revolution
she
was
born
in
paris
in
when
her
father
necker
was
amassing
an
enormous
fortune
as
a
banker
and
financier
afterwards
so
celebrated
as
finance
minister
to
louis
xvi
her
mother
susanne
curchod
of
humble
swiss
parentage
was
yet
one
of
the
remarkable
women
of
the
day
a
lady
whom
gibbon
would
have
married
had
english
prejudices
and
conventionalities
permitted
but
whose
marriage
with
necker
was
both
fortunate
and
happy
they
had
only
one
child
but
she
was
a
minerva
it
seems
that
she
was
of
extraordinary
precocity
and
very
early
attracted
attention
as
a
mere
child
marmontel
talked
with
her
as
if
she
were
at
fifteen
she
had
written
reflections
on
montesquieu
spirit
of
laws
and
was
solicited
by
raynal
to
furnish
an
article
on
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
so
brilliant
a
girl
was
educated
by
her
wealthy
parents
without
regard
to
expense
and
with
the
greatest
care
she
was
fortunate
from
the
start
with
unbounded
means
surrounded
with
illustrious
people
and
with
every
opportunity
for
improvement
both
as
to
teachers
and
society
doubtless
one
important
cause
of
her
subsequent
success
for
very
few
people
climb
the
upper
rounds
of
the
ladder
of
literary
fame
who
are
obliged
to
earn
their
living
their
genius
is
fettered
and
their
time
is
employed
on
irksome
drudgeries
madame
de
staël
when
a
girl
came
very
near
losing
her
health
and
breaking
her
fine
constitution
by
the
unwise
cramming
on
which
her
mother
insisted
for
although
a
superior
woman
madame
necker
knew
very
little
about
the
true
system
of
education
thinking
that
study
and
labor
should
be
incessant
and
that
these
alone
could
do
everything
she
loaded
her
daughter
with
too
many
restraints
and
bound
her
by
a
too
rigid
discipline
she
did
all
she
could
to
crush
genius
out
of
the
girl
and
make
her
a
dictionary
or
a
machine
or
a
piece
of
formality
and
conventionalism
but
the
father
wiser
and
with
greater
insight
and
truer
sympathy
relaxed
the
cords
of
discipline
unfettered
her
imagination
connived
at
her
flights
of
extravagance
and
allowed
her
to
develop
her
faculties
in
her
own
way
she
had
a
remarkable
fondness
for
her
father
she
adored
him
and
clung
to
him
through
life
with
peculiar
tenderness
and
devotion
which
he
appreciated
and
repaid
before
she
was
twenty
she
wrote
poetry
as
a
matter
of
course
most
girls
do
i
mean
those
who
are
bright
and
sentimental
still
she
produced
but
indifferent
work
like
cicero
when
he
was
young
and
soon
dropped
rhyme
forever
for
the
greater
freedom
of
prose
into
which
she
poured
from
the
first
all
the
wealth
of
her
poetic
soul
she
was
a
poet
disdaining
measure
but
exquisite
in
rhythm
for
nothing
can
be
more
musical
than
her
style
as
remarked
in
the
lecture
on
madame
récamier
it
is
seldom
that
people
acquire
the
art
of
conversation
till
middle
life
when
the
mind
is
enriched
and
confidence
is
gained
the
great
conversational
powers
of
johnson
burke
mackintosh
coleridge
wilkes
garrick
walpole
sydney
smith
were
most
remarkable
in
their
later
years
after
they
had
read
everything
and
seen
everybody
but
madame
de
staël
was
brilliant
in
conversation
from
her
youth
she
was
the
delight
of
every
circle
the
admiration
of
the
most
gifted
men
not
for
her
beauty
for
she
was
not
considered
beautiful
but
for
her
wit
her
vivacity
her
repartee
her
animated
and
sympathetic
face
her
electrical
power
for
she
could
kindle
inspire
instruct
or
bewitch
she
played
she
sang
she
discoursed
on
everything
a
priestess
a
sibyl
full
of
inspiration
listened
to
as
an
oracle
or
an
idol
to
hear
her
says
sismondi
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
the
experience
of
many
souls
mingled
into
one
i
looked
and
listened
with
transport
i
discovered
in
her
features
a
charm
superior
to
beauty
and
if
i
do
not
hear
her
words
yet
her
tones
her
gestures
and
her
looks
convey
to
me
her
meaning
it
is
said
that
though
her
features
were
not
beautiful
her
eyes
were
remarkable
large
dark
lustrous
animated
flashing
confiding
and
bathed
in
light
they
were
truly
the
windows
of
her
soul
and
it
was
her
soul
even
more
than
her
intellect
which
made
her
so
interesting
and
so
great
i
think
that
intellect
without
soul
is
rather
repulsive
than
otherwise
is
cold
critical
arrogant
cynical
something
from
which
we
flee
since
we
find
no
sympathy
and
sometimes
no
toleration
from
it
the
soul
of
madame
de
staël
immeasurably
towered
above
her
intellect
great
as
that
was
and
gave
her
eloquence
fervor
sincerity
poetry
intensified
her
genius
and
made
her
irresistible
it
was
this
combination
of
wit
sympathy
and
conversational
talent
which
made
madame
de
staël
so
inordinately
fond
of
society
to
satisfy
longings
and
cravings
that
neither
nature
nor
books
nor
home
could
fully
meet
with
all
her
genius
and
learning
she
was
a
restless
woman
and
even
friendship
for
which
she
had
a
great
capacity
could
not
bind
her
or
confine
her
long
to
any
one
place
but
paris
which
was
to
her
the
world
not
for
its
shops
or
fashions
or
churches
or
museums
and
or
historical
monuments
and
memories
but
for
those
coteries
where
blazed
the
great
wits
of
the
age
among
whom
she
too
would
shine
and
dazzle
and
inspire
she
was
not
without
heart
as
her
warm
and
lasting
friendships
attest
but
the
animating
passion
of
her
life
was
love
of
admiration
which
was
only
equalled
by
a
craving
for
sympathy
that
no
friendship
could
satisfy
a
want
of
her
nature
that
reveals
an
ardent
soul
rather
than
a
great
heart
for
many
a
woman
can
live
contentedly
in
retirement
whether
in
city
or
country
which
madame
de
staël
could
not
not
even
when
surrounded
with
every
luxury
and
all
the
charms
of
nature
such
a
young
lady
as
mademoiselle
necker
so
gifted
so
accomplished
so
rich
so
elevated
in
social
position
could
aspire
very
high
and
both
her
father
and
mother
were
ambitious
for
so
remarkable
a
daughter
but
the
mother
would
not
consent
to
her
marriage
with
a
catholic
and
she
herself
insisted
on
a
permanent
residence
in
paris
it
was
hard
to
meet
such
conditions
and
yet
make
a
brilliant
match
for
after
all
her
father
though
minister
was
only
a
clever
and
rich
swiss
financier
not
a
nobleman
or
a
man
of
great
family
influence
the
baron
de
then
secretary
to
the
swedish
embassy
afterwards
ambassador
from
sweden
was
the
most
available
suitor
since
he
was
a
nobleman
a
protestant
and
a
diplomatist
and
mademoiselle
necker
became
his
wife
in
at
twenty
years
of
age
with
a
dowry
of
two
millions
of
francs
her
social
position
was
raised
by
this
marriage
since
her
husband
was
a
favorite
at
court
and
she
saw
much
of
the
queen
and
of
the
great
ladies
who
surrounded
her
but
the
marriage
was
not
happy
the
husband
was
extravagant
and
the
wife
panted
for
beatitudes
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
give
so
they
separated
after
a
while
but
were
not
divorced
both
before
and
after
that
event
however
her
house
was
the
resort
of
the
best
society
of
the
city
and
she
was
its
brightest
ornament
thither
came
grimm
talleyrand
barnave
lafayette
narbonne
sieyès
all
friends
she
was
an
to
the
terrible
scenes
of
the
revolution
and
escaped
judicial
assassination
almost
by
miracle
at
last
she
succeeded
in
making
her
escape
to
switzerland
and
lived
a
while
in
her
magnificent
near
geneva
surrounded
with
illustrious
exiles
soon
after
she
made
her
first
visit
to
england
but
returned
to
paris
when
the
violence
of
the
revolution
was
over
she
returned
the
very
day
that
napoleon
as
first
consul
had
seized
the
reins
of
government
she
had
hailed
the
revolution
with
transport
although
she
was
so
nearly
its
victim
she
had
faith
in
its
ideas
she
believed
that
the
people
were
the
ultimate
source
of
power
she
condoned
the
excesses
of
the
revolution
in
view
of
its
aspirations
napoleon
gained
his
first
great
victories
in
defence
of
its
ideas
so
at
first
in
common
with
the
friends
of
liberty
she
was
prepared
to
worship
this
rising
sun
dazzled
by
his
deeds
and
deceived
by
his
lying
words
but
she
no
sooner
saw
him
than
she
was
repelled
especially
when
she
knew
he
had
trampled
on
the
liberties
which
he
had
professed
to
defend
her
instincts
penetrated
through
all
the
plaudits
of
his
idolaters
she
felt
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
a
great
cause
was
heartless
unboundedly
ambitious
insufferably
egotistic
a
who
would
brush
away
everything
and
everybody
that
stood
in
his
way
and
she
hated
him
and
she
defied
him
and
her
house
became
the
centre
of
opposition
the
headquarters
of
enmity
and
wrath
what
was
his
glory
as
a
conqueror
compared
with
the
cause
she
loved
trodden
under
foot
by
an
iron
rigid
jealous
irresistible
despotism
nor
did
napoleon
like
her
any
better
than
she
liked
him
not
that
he
was
envious
but
because
she
stood
in
his
way
he
expected
universal
homage
and
devotion
neither
of
which
would
she
give
him
he
was
exceedingly
irritated
at
the
reports
of
her
bitter
sayings
blended
with
ridicule
and
sarcasm
he
was
not
merely
annoyed
he
was
afraid
her
arrows
said
he
would
hit
a
man
if
he
were
seated
on
a
rainbow
and
when
he
found
he
could
not
silence
her
he
banished
her
to
within
forty
leagues
of
paris
he
was
not
naturally
cruel
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
allow
so
bright
a
woman
to
say
her
sharp
things
about
him
to
his
generals
and
courtiers
it
was
not
the
worst
thing
he
ever
did
to
banish
his
greatest
enemy
but
it
was
mean
and
cruel
to
persecute
her
as
he
did
after
she
was
banished
so
from
paris
to
her
the
hub
of
the
universe
madame
de
staël
with
wandering
steps
and
slow
took
her
solitary
way
expelled
from
the
eden
she
loved
she
sought
to
find
some
place
where
she
could
enjoy
society
which
was
the
passion
of
her
life
weimar
in
germany
then
contained
a
constellation
of
illustrious
men
over
whom
goethe
reigned
as
johnson
once
did
in
london
thither
she
resolved
to
go
after
a
brief
stay
at
coppet
her
place
in
switzerland
and
her
ten
years
exile
began
with
a
sojourn
among
the
brightest
intellects
of
germany
she
was
cordially
received
at
weimar
especially
by
the
court
although
the
dictator
of
german
literature
did
not
like
her
much
she
was
too
impetuous
impulsive
and
masculine
for
him
schiller
and
wieland
and
schlegel
liked
her
better
and
understood
her
better
her
great
works
had
not
then
been
written
and
she
had
reputation
chiefly
for
her
high
social
position
and
social
qualities
possibly
her
exceeding
vivacity
and
wit
seemed
superficial
as
witty
french
people
then
seemed
to
both
germans
and
english
doubtless
there
were
critics
and
philosophers
in
germany
who
were
not
capable
of
appreciating
a
person
who
aspired
to
penetrate
all
the
secrets
of
art
philosophy
religion
and
science
then
known
who
tried
to
master
everything
and
who
talked
eloquently
on
everything
and
that
person
a
woman
and
a
frenchwoman
goethe
was
indeed
an
exception
to
most
german
critics
for
he
was
an
artist
as
few
germans
have
been
in
the
use
of
language
and
he
like
humboldt
had
universal
knowledge
yet
he
did
not
like
madame
de
staël
not
from
envy
he
had
too
much
to
be
envious
of
any
man
still
less
a
woman
envy
does
not
exist
between
the
sexes
a
musician
may
be
jealous
of
a
musician
a
poet
of
a
poet
a
theologian
of
a
theologian
and
it
is
said
a
physician
has
been
known
to
be
jealous
of
a
physician
i
think
it
is
probable
that
the
gifted
frenchwoman
overwhelmed
the
great
german
with
her
prodigality
of
wit
sarcasm
and
sentiment
for
he
was
inclined
to
coldness
and
taciturnity
madame
de
staël
speaks
respectfully
of
the
great
men
she
met
at
weimar
but
i
do
not
think
she
worshipped
them
since
she
did
not
fully
understand
them
especially
fichte
whom
she
ridiculed
as
well
as
other
obscure
though
profound
writers
who
disdained
style
and
art
in
writing
for
which
she
was
afterwards
so
distinguished
i
believe
of
german
literature
is
wasted
on
europeans
for
lack
of
clearness
and
directness
of
style
although
the
involved
obscurities
which
are
common
to
german
philosophers
and
critics
and
historians
alike
do
not
seem
to
derogate
from
their
literary
fame
at
home
and
have
even
found
imitators
in
england
like
coleridge
and
carlyle
nevertheless
obscurity
and
affectation
are
eternal
blots
on
literary
genius
since
they
are
irreconcilable
with
art
which
alone
gives
perpetuity
to
learning
as
illustrated
by
the
classic
authors
of
antiquity
and
such
men
as
pascal
rousseau
and
macaulay
in
our
times
although
the
pedants
have
always
disdained
those
who
write
clearly
and
luminously
and
lost
reverence
for
genius
the
moment
it
is
understood
since
clear
writing
shows
how
little
is
truly
original
and
makes
a
disquisition
on
a
bug
a
comma
or
a
date
seem
trivial
indeed
hitherto
madame
de
staël
had
reigned
in
rather
than
on
the
throne
of
letters
until
her
visit
to
germany
she
had
written
but
two
books
which
had
given
her
fame
one
on
literature
considered
in
its
relations
with
social
institutions
and
a
novel
entitled
delphine
neither
of
which
is
much
read
or
prized
in
these
times
the
leading
idea
of
her
book
on
literature
was
the
perfectibility
of
human
nature
not
new
since
it
had
been
affirmed
by
ferguson
in
england
by
kant
in
germany
and
by
turgot
in
france
and
even
by
roger
bacon
in
the
middle
ages
but
she
claimed
to
be
the
first
to
apply
perfectibility
to
literature
if
her
idea
simply
means
the
progress
of
the
human
mind
with
the
aids
that
providence
has
furnished
she
is
doubtless
right
if
she
means
that
the
necessary
condition
of
human
nature
unaided
is
towards
perfection
she
wars
with
christianity
and
agrees
with
rousseau
the
idea
was
fashionable
in
its
day
especially
by
the
disciples
of
rousseau
who
maintained
that
the
majority
could
not
err
but
if
madame
de
staël
simply
meant
that
society
was
destined
to
progressive
advancement
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
view
will
be
generally
accepted
since
god
rules
this
world
and
brings
good
out
of
evil
some
maintain
we
have
made
no
advance
over
ancient
india
in
either
morals
or
literature
or
science
or
over
greece
in
art
or
rome
in
jurisprudence
and
yet
we
believe
the
condition
of
humanity
is
superior
to
what
it
has
been
on
the
whole
in
any
previous
age
of
our
world
but
let
us
give
the
credit
of
this
advance
to
god
and
not
to
man
her
other
book
delphine
published
in
made
a
great
sensation
like
a
modern
novel
but
was
severely
criticised
sydney
smith
reviewed
it
in
a
slashing
article
it
was
considered
by
many
as
immoral
in
its
tendency
since
she
was
supposed
to
attack
marriage
the
greatest
critic
of
the
age
defends
her
against
this
charge
but
the
book
was
doubtless
very
emotional
into
which
she
poured
all
the
warmth
of
her
ardent
and
ungoverned
soul
in
its
restless
agitation
and
cravings
for
sympathy
a
record
of
herself
blasted
in
her
marriage
hopes
and
aspirations
it
is
a
sort
of
new
héloïse
and
though
powerful
is
not
healthy
these
two
works
however
stamped
her
as
a
woman
of
genius
although
her
highest
triumphs
were
not
yet
won
with
the
éclat
of
these
two
books
she
traversed
germany
studying
laws
literature
and
manners
assisted
in
her
studies
by
august
schlegel
the
translator
of
shakspeare
who
was
tutor
to
her
children
on
a
salary
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
expenses
she
had
great
admiration
for
this
distinguished
scholar
who
combined
with
his
linguistic
attainments
an
intense
love
of
art
and
a
profound
appreciation
of
genius
in
whatever
guise
it
was
to
be
found
with
such
a
cicerone
she
could
not
help
making
great
acquisitions
he
was
like
jerome
explaining
to
paula
the
history
of
the
sacred
places
like
johnson
teaching
ethics
to
hannah
more
like
michael
angelo
explaining
the
principles
of
art
to
vittoria
colonna
she
mastered
the
language
of
which
frederick
the
great
was
ashamed
and
for
the
first
time
did
justice
to
the
german
scholars
and
the
german
character
she
defended
the
ideal
philosophy
against
locke
and
the
french
materialists
she
made
a
remarkable
analysis
of
kant
she
warmly
praised
both
goethe
and
schiller
she
admired
wieland
she
had
a
good
word
for
fichte
although
she
had
ridiculed
his
obscurities
of
style
the
result
of
her
travels
was
the
most
masterly
dissertation
on
that
great
country
that
has
ever
been
written
an
astonishing
book
when
we
remember
it
was
the
first
of
any
note
which
had
appeared
of
its
kind
to
me
it
is
more
like
the
history
of
herodotus
than
any
book
of
travels
which
has
appeared
since
that
accomplished
scholar
traversed
asia
and
africa
to
reveal
to
his
inquisitive
countrymen
the
treasures
of
oriental
monarchies
in
this
work
which
is
intellectually
her
greatest
she
towered
not
only
over
all
women
but
over
all
men
who
have
since
been
her
competitors
it
does
not
fall
in
with
my
purpose
to
give
other
than
a
passing
notice
of
this
masterly
production
in
order
to
show
what
a
marvellous
woman
she
was
not
in
the
realm
of
sentiment
alone
not
as
a
writer
of
letters
but
as
a
critic
capable
of
grasping
and
explaining
all
that
philosophy
art
and
literature
have
sought
to
accomplish
in
that
as
germany
was
then
regarded
she
revealed
a
new
country
to
the
rest
of
europe
she
described
with
accuracy
its
manners
and
customs
she
did
justice
to
the
german
intellect
she
showed
what
amazing
scholarship
already
existed
in
the
universities
far
surpassing
both
paris
and
oxford
she
appreciated
the
german
character
its
simplicity
its
truthfulness
its
sincerity
its
intellectual
boldness
its
patience
its
reserved
power
afterwards
to
be
developed
in
war
qualities
and
attainments
which
have
since
raised
germany
to
the
foremost
rank
among
the
european
nations
this
brilliant
frenchwoman
accustomed
to
reign
in
the
most
cultivated
social
circles
of
paris
shows
a
remarkable
catholicity
and
breadth
of
judgment
and
is
not
shocked
at
phlegmatic
dulness
or
hyperborean
awkwardness
or
laughable
simplicity
because
she
sees
what
nobody
else
then
saw
a
patience
which
never
wearies
a
quiet
enthusiasm
which
no
difficulty
or
disgust
destroys
and
a
great
insight
which
can
give
richness
to
literature
without
art
discrimination
to
philosophy
without
conciseness
and
a
new
meaning
to
old
dogmas
she
ventures
to
pluck
from
the
forbidden
tree
of
metaphysics
and
reckless
of
the
fiats
of
the
schools
she
entered
fearlessly
into
those
inquiries
which
have
appalled
both
greek
and
schoolman
think
of
a
woman
making
the
best
translation
and
criticism
of
kant
which
had
appeared
until
her
day
her
revelations
might
have
found
more
value
in
the
eyes
of
pedants
had
she
been
more
obscure
but
as
sir
james
mackintosh
says
dullness
is
not
accuracy
nor
is
an
elegant
writer
necessarily
superficial
divest
german
metaphysics
of
their
obscurities
and
they
might
seem
commonplace
take
away
the
clearness
of
french
writers
and
they
might
pass
for
profound
clearness
and
precision
however
are
not
what
the
world
expects
from
its
teachers
it
loves
the
with
nothing
but
leaves
it
adores
the
magni
nominis
the
highest
proof
of
severe
culture
is
the
use
of
short
and
simple
words
on
any
subject
whatever
and
he
who
can
not
make
his
readers
understand
what
he
writes
about
does
not
understand
his
subject
himself
i
am
happy
to
have
these
views
corroborated
by
one
of
the
best
writers
that
this
country
has
produced
i
mean
william
matthews
the
french
who
if
not
the
most
original
are
certainly
the
acutest
and
most
logical
thinkers
in
the
world
are
frequently
considered
frivolous
and
shallow
simply
because
they
excel
all
other
nations
in
the
difficult
art
of
giving
literary
interest
to
philosophy
while
on
the
other
hand
the
ponderous
germans
who
living
in
clouds
of
smoke
have
a
positive
genius
for
making
the
obscure
obscurer
are
thought
to
be
original
because
they
are
so
chaotic
and
clumsy
but
we
have
yet
to
learn
that
lead
is
priceless
because
it
is
weighty
or
that
gold
is
valueless
because
it
glitters
the
damascus
blade
is
none
the
less
keen
because
it
is
polished
nor
the
corinthian
shaft
less
strong
because
it
is
fluted
and
its
capital
curved
the
production
of
such
a
woman
in
that
age
in
which
there
is
so
much
learning
combined
with
eloquence
and
elevation
of
sentiment
with
acute
observation
and
the
graces
of
style
with
the
spirit
of
philosophy
candid
yet
eulogistic
discriminating
yet
enthusiastic
made
a
great
impression
on
the
mind
of
cultivated
europe
napoleon
however
with
inexcusable
but
characteristic
meanness
would
not
allow
its
publication
the
police
seized
the
whole
edition
ten
thousand
and
destroyed
every
copy
they
even
tried
to
get
possession
of
the
original
copy
which
required
the
greatest
tact
on
the
part
of
the
author
to
preserve
and
which
she
carried
with
her
on
all
her
travels
for
six
years
until
it
was
finally
printed
in
london
long
before
this
great
work
was
completed
for
she
worked
upon
it
six
years
madame
de
staël
visited
with
sismondi
that
country
which
above
all
others
is
dear
to
the
poet
the
artist
and
the
antiquarian
she
entered
that
classic
and
hallowed
land
amid
the
glories
of
a
southern
spring
when
the
balmy
air
the
beautiful
sky
the
fresh
verdure
of
the
fields
and
the
singing
of
the
birds
added
fascination
to
scenes
which
without
them
would
have
been
enchantment
châteaubriand
the
only
french
writer
of
her
day
with
whom
she
stood
in
proud
equality
also
visited
italy
but
sang
another
song
she
bright
and
radiant
with
hope
and
cheerfulness
an
admirer
of
the
people
and
the
country
as
they
were
he
mournful
and
desponding
yet
not
less
poetic
with
visions
of
departed
glory
which
the
vast
debris
of
the
ancient
magnificence
suggested
to
his
pensive
soul
o

italy
land
of
associations
whose
history
never
tires
whose
antiquities
are
perpetual
studies
whose
works
of
art
provoke
to
hopeless
imitation
whose
struggles
until
recently
were
equally
chivalric
and
unfortunate
whose
aspirations
have
ever
been
with
liberty
yet
whose
destiny
has
been
successive

madame
de
staël
lingered
more
than
a
year
visiting
every
city
which
has
a
history
and
every
monument
which
has
antiquity
and
the
result
of
that
journey
was
corinne
one
of
the
few
immortal
books
which
the
heart
of
the
world
cherishes
which
is
as
fresh
as
it
was
nearly
one
hundred
years
ago
a
novel
a
critique
a
painting
a
poem
a
tragedy
interesting
to
the
philosopher
in
his
study
and
to
the
woman
in
her
boudoir
since
it
is
the
record
of
the
cravings
of
a
great
soul
and
a
description
of
what
is
most
beautiful
or
venerated
in
nature
or
art
it
is
the
most
wonderful
book
ever
written
of
italy
with
faults
of
course
but
a
transcript
of
profound
sorrows
and
lofty
aspirations
to
some
it
may
seem
exaggerated
in
its
transports
but
can
transports
be
too
highly
colored
can
any
words
be
as
vivid
as
a
sensation
enthusiasm
when
fully
expressed
ceases
to
be
a
rapture
and
the
soul
that
fancies
it
has
reached
the
heights
of
love
or
beauty
or
truth
claims
to
comprehend
the
immortal
and
the
infinite
it
is
the
effort
of
genius
to
express
the
raptures
and
sorrows
of
a
lofty
but
unsatisfied
soul
the
glories
of
the
imperishable
in
art
and
life
which
gives
to
corinne
its
peculiar
charm
it
is
the
mirror
of
a
wide
and
deep
experience
a
sort
of
divine
comedy
in
which
a
dante
finds
a
beatrice
not
robed
in
celestial
loveliness
coursing
from
circle
to
circle
and
star
to
star
explaining
the
mysteries
of
heaven
but
radiant
in
the
beauty
of
earth
and
glowing
with
the
ardor
of
a
human
love
every
page
is
masculine
in
power
every
sentence
is
condensed
thought
every
line
burns
with
passion
yet
every
sentiment
betrays
the
woman
seeking
to
reveal
her
own
boundless
capacities
of
admiration
and
friendship
to
be
appreciated
to
be
loved
with
that
fervor
and
disinterestedness
which
she
was
prepared
to
lavish
on
the
object
of
her
adoration
no
man
could
have
made
such
revelations
although
it
may
be
given
to
him
to
sing
a
greater
song
while
no
woman
could
have
composed
the
iliad
or
the
novum
organum
or
the
critique
of
pure
reason
or
othello
no
man
could
have
written
corinne
or
adam
bede
in
painting
corinne
madame
de
staël
simply
describes
herself
as
she
did
in
delphine
with
all
her
restless
yet
not
in
too
flattering
colors
since
i
doubt
if
there
ever
lived
a
more
impassioned
soul
with
greater
desires
of
knowledge
or
a
more
devouring
thirst
for
fame
or
a
profounder
insight
into
what
is
lofty
and
eternal
than
the
author
of
corinne
like
héloïse
she
could
love
but
one
yet
unlike
héloïse
she
could
not
renounce
even
for
love
the
passion
for
admiration
or
the
fascinations
of
society
she
does
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
immense
sacrifices
which
love
exacts
and
marriage
implies
but
which
such
a
woman
as
héloïse
is
proud
to
make
for
him
whom
she
deems
worthy
of
her
own
exalted
sentiments
and
she
shows
in
the
person
of
corinne
how
much
weakness
may
coexist
with
strength
and
how
timid
and
dependent
is
a
woman
even
in
the
blaze
of
triumph
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
haughty
freedom
she
paints
the
most
shrinking
delicacy
with
the
greatest
imprudence
and
boldness
contempt
for
the
opinions
and
usages
of
society
with
the
severest
giving
occasion
for
scandal
yet
escaping
from
its
shafts
triumphant
in
the
greatness
of
her
own
dignity
and
in
the
purity
of
her
unsullied
soul
corinne
is
a
disguised
sarcasm
on
the
usages
of
society
among
the
upper
classes
in
madame
de
staël
day
when
a
man
like
lord
neville
is
represented
as
capable
of
the
most
exalted
passion
and
almost
ready
to
die
for
its
object
and
at
the
same
time
is
unwilling
to
follow
its
promptings
to
an
honorable
issue
ready
even
at
last
to
marry
a
woman
for
whom
he
feels
no
strong
attachment
or
even
admiration
in
compliance
with
expediency
pride
and
family
interests
but
corinne
is
not
so
much
a
romance
as
it
is
a
description
of
italy
itself
its
pictures
its
statues
its
palaces
its
churches
its
antiquities
its
literature
its
manners
and
its
aspirations
and
it
is
astonishing
how
much
is
condensed
in
that
little
book
the
author
has
forestalled
all
poets
and
travellers
and
even
guidebooks
all
successive
works
are
repetitions
or
amplifications
of
what
she
has
suggested
she
is
as
exhaustive
and
condensed
as
thucydides
and
true
to
her
philosophy
she
is
all
sunshine
and
hope
with
unbounded
faith
in
the
future
of
italy
an
exultant
prophet
as
well
as
a
critical
observer
this
work
was
published
in
paris
in
when
napoleon
was
on
the
apex
of
his
power
and
glory
and
no
work
by
a
woman
was
ever
hailed
with
greater
enthusiasm
not
in
paris
merely
but
throughout
europe
yet
nothing
could
melt
the
iron
heart
of
napoleon
and
he
continued
his
implacable
persecution
of
its
author
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
continue
her
travels
though
travelling
like
a
princess
again
she
visited
germany
and
again
she
retired
to
her
place
near
geneva
where
she
held
a
sort
of
court
the
star
of
which
next
to
herself
was
madame
récamier
whose
transcendent
beauty
and
equally
transcendent
loveliness
of
character
won
her
admiration
and
friendship
in
madame
de
staël
married
rocca
of
italian
or
spanish
origin
who
was
a
sickly
and
dilapidated
officer
in
the
french
army
little
more
than
half
her
age
he
being
and
she
a
strange
marriage
almost
incredible
if
such
marriages
were
not
frequent
he
though
feeble
was
an
accomplished
man
and
was
taken
captive
by
the
brilliancy
of
her
talk
and
the
elevation
of
her
soul
it
is
harder
to
tell
what
captured
her
for
who
can
explain
the
mysteries
of
love
the
marriage
proved
happy
however
although
both
parties
dreaded
ridicule
and
kept
it
secret
the
romance
of
the
thing
if
romance
there
was
has
been
equalled
in
our
day
by
the
marriages
of
george
eliot
and
miss
burdett
coutts
only
very
strong
characters
can
afford
to
run
such
risks
the
caprices
of
the
great
are
among
the
unsolved
mysteries
of
life
a
poor
wounded
unknown
young
man
would
never
have
aspired
to
such
an
audacity
had
he
not
been
sure
of
his
ground
and
the
probability
is
that
she
not
he
is
to
be
blamed
for
that
folly
if
a
woman
is
to
be
blamed
for
an
attachment
which
the
world
calls
an
absurdity
the
wrath
of
napoleon
waxing
stronger
and
stronger
madame
de
staël
felt
obliged
to
flee
even
from
switzerland
she
sought
a
rest
in
england
but
england
was
hard
to
be
reached
as
all
the
continent
save
russia
was
in
bondage
and
fear
she
succeeded
in
reaching
vienna
then
russia
and
finally
sweden
where
she
lingered
as
it
was
the
fashion
to
receive
attentions
and
admiration
from
all
who
were
great
in
position
or
eminent
for
attainments
in
the
northern
capitals
of
europe
she
liked
even
russia
she
saw
good
everywhere
something
to
praise
and
enjoy
wherever
she
went
moscow
and
petersburg
were
equally
interesting

old
and
the
new

stupendous

of
the
other
romanzoff
orloff
the
empress
elizabeth
and
the
emperor
alexander
himself
gave
her
distinguished
honors
and
hospitalities
and
she
saw
and
recorded
their
greatness
and
abandoned
herself
to
pleasures
which
were
new
after
a
delightful
winter
in
stockholm
she
sailed
for
england
where
she
arrived
in
safety
twenty
years
after
her
first
visit
and
in
the
ninth
of
her
exile
her
reception
in
the
highest
circles
was
enthusiastic
she
was
recognized
as
the
greatest
literary
woman
who
had
lived
the
prince

sought
her
acquaintance
the
greatest

feted
her
in

at
lord

at

literary
dinners
at

everywhere
she
was
admired
and
honored
sir
james
mackintosh
the
idol
and
oracle
of
english
society
at
that
time
pronounced
her
the
most
intellectual
woman
who
had
adorned
the
world
not
as
a
novelist
and
poet
merely
but
as
philosopher
and
critic
grappling
with
the
highest
questions
that
ever
tasked
the
intellect
of
man
byron
alone
stood
aloof
he
did
not
like
women
any
more
than
goethe
did
especially
if
they
were
not
beautiful
but
he
was
constrained
to
admire
her
at
last
nobody
could
resist
the
fascination
and
brilliancy
of
her
conversation
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
she
did
not
write
a
book
on
england
which
on
the
whole
she
admired
although
it
was
a
little
too
conventional
for
her
but
she
was
now
nearly
worn
out
by
the
excitements
and
the
sorrows
of
her
life
she
was
no
longer
young
her
literary
work
was
done
and
she
had
to
resort
to
opium
to
rally
from
the
exhaustion
of
her
nervous
energies
on
the
fall
of
napoleon
madame
de

returned
to
paris
the
city
she
loved
so
well
the

so
dear

exile
from
this
city
has
ever
been
regarded
as
a
great
calamity
as
great
as
exile
was
to
romans
even
to
cicero
see
with
what
eagerness
thiers
himself
returned
to
this
charmed
capital
when
permitted
by
the
last
napoleon
in
this
city
after
her
ten
years
exile
madame
de
staël
reigned
in
prouder
state
than
at
any
previous
period
of
her
life
she
was
now
at
home
on
her
own
throne
as
queen
of
letters
and
also
queen
of

all

the

caught
inspiration
from
her
presence
never
was
woman
seated
on
a
prouder
throne
but
she
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
her
unparalleled
social
honors
she
was
stifled
like
voltaire
by
the
incense
of
idolaters
the
body
could
no
longer
stand
the
strain
of
the
soul
and
she
sunk
at
the
age
of
in

a
few
months
before
her

it

she
ever
tenderly

madame
de

died
prematurely
as
precocious
people
generally
do
like
raphael
pascal
schiller
i
may
add
macaulay
and
mill
but
she
accomplished
much
and
might
have
done
more
had
her
life
been
spared
for
no
one

her
genius
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
female
writer
who
has
lived
on
the
whole
george
sand
is
the
only
frenchwoman
who
has
approached
her
in
genius
and
fame
madame
de
staël
was
novelist
critic
essayist
and
philosopher
grasping
the
profoundest
subjects
and
gaining
admiration
in
everything
she
attempted
i
do
not
regard
her
as
a
happy
woman
since
her
marriages
were
either
unfortunate
or
unnatural
in
the
intoxicating
blaze
of
triumph
and
admiration
she
panted
for
domestic
beatitudes
and
found
the
earnest
cravings
of
her
soul
unsatisfied
she
sought
relief
from
herself
in
society
which
was
a
necessity
to
her
as
much
as
friendship
or
love
but
she
was
restless
and
perpetually
travelling
moreover
she
was
a
persecuted
woman
during
the
best
ten
years
of
her
life
she
had
but
little
repose
of
mind
or
character
and
was
worldly
vain
and
ambitious
but
she
was
a
great
woman
and
a
good
woman
in
spite
of
her
faults
and
errors
and
greater
in
her
womanly
qualities
than
she
was
in
her
writings
remarkable
as
these
were
she
had
a
great
individuality
like
johnson
and
thomas
carlyle
and
she
lives
in
the
hearts
of
her
countrymen
like
madame
récamier
for
it
was
not
the
beauty
and
grace
of
this
queen
of
society
which
made
her
beloved
but
her
amiability
power
of
friendship
freedom
from
envy
and
generous
soul
in
the
estimation
of
foreigners
of
those
great
critics
of
whom
jeffrey
and
mackintosh
were
the
representatives
madame
de
staël
has
won
the
proud
fame
of
being
the
most
powerful
writer
her
country
has
produced
since
voltaire
and
rousseau
historically
she
is
memorable
for
inaugurating
a
new
period
of
literary
history
with
her
began
a
new
class
of
female
authors
whose
genius
was
no
longer
confined
to
letters
and
memoirs
and
sentimental
novels
i
need
not
enumerate
the
long
catalogue
of
illustrious
literary
women
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
france
in
germany
in
england
and
even
in
the
united
states
the
greatest
novelist
in
england
since
thackeray
was
a
woman
one
of
the
greatest
writers
on
political
economy
since
adam
smith
was
a
woman
one
of
the
greatest
writers
in
astronomical
science
was
a
woman
in
america
what
single
novel
ever
equalled
the
success
of
uncle
cabin
what
schools
are
better
kept
than
those
by
women
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
since
it
is
generally
felt
that
women
are
better
educated
than
men
outside
of
the
great
professions
and
why
not
since
they
have
more
leisure
for
literary
pursuits
than
men
who
now
sneers
at
the
intellect
of
a
woman
who
laughs
at
who
denies
the
insight
the
superior
tact
the
genius
of
woman
what
man
does
not
accept
woman
as
a
in
the
field
of
letters
and
yet
there
is
one
profession
which
they
are
more
capable
of
filling
than
men
that
of
physicians
to
their
own
sex
a
profession
most
honorable
and
requiring
great
knowledge
as
well
as
great
experience
and
insight
why
may
not
women
cope
with
men
in
the
proudest
intellectual
tournaments
why
should
they
not
become
great
linguists
and
poets
and
novelists
and
artists
and
critics
and
historians
have
they
not
quickness
brilliancy
sentiment
acuteness
of
observation
good
sense
and
even
genius
do
not
women
speak
french
before
their
brothers
can
translate
the
easiest
lines
of
virgil
i
would
not
put
such
gentle
refined
and
cultivated
creatures
these
flowers
of
paradise
spreading
the
sweet
aroma
of
their
graces
in
the
calm
retreats
from
toil
and
sin
i
would
not
push
them
into
the
noisy
arena
of
wrangling
politics
into
the
suffocating
and
impure
air
of
a
court
of
justice
or
even
make
them
professors
in
a
college
of
unruly
boys
but
because
i
would
not
do
them
this
great
cruelty
do
i
deny
their
intellectual
equality
or
seek
to
dim
the
lustre
of
the
light
they
shed
or
hide
their
talents
under
the
vile
bushel
of
envy
cynicism
or
contempt
is
it
paying
true
respect
to
woman
to
seek
to
draw
her
from
the
beautiful
sphere
which
she
adorns
and
vivifies
and
inspires
where
she
is
a
solace
a
rest
a
restraint
and
a
benediction
and
require
of
her
labors
which
she
has
not
the
physical
strength
to
perform
and
when
it
is
seen
how
much
more
attractive
the
wives
and
daughters
of
favored
classes
have
made
themselves
by
culture
how
much
more
capable
they
are
of
training
and
educating
their
children
how
much
more
dignified
the
family
circle
may
thus
become
every
man
who
is
a
father
will
rejoice
in
this
great
step
which
women
have
recently
made
not
merely
in
literary
attainments
but
in
the
respect
of
men
take
away
intellect
from
woman
and
what
is
she
but
a
toy
or
a
slave
for
my
part
i
see
no
more
cheering
signs
of
the
progress
of
society
than
in
the
advancing
knowledge
of
favored
women
and
i
know
of
no
more
splendid
future
for
them
than
to
encircle
their
brows
whenever
they
have
an
opportunity
with
those
proud
laurels
which
have
ever
been
accorded
to
those
who
have
advanced
the
interests
of
truth
and
the
dominion
of
the
soul
which
laurels
they
have
lately
won
and
which
both
reason
and

assure
us
they

one
of
the
useful
and
grateful
tasks
of
historians
and
biographers
is
to
bring
forward
to
the
eye
of
every
new
generation
of
men
and
women
those
illustrious
characters
who
made
a
great
figure
in
the
days
of
their
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
yet
who
have
nearly
faded
out
of
sight
in
the
rush
of
new
events
and
interests
and
the
rise
of
new
stars
in
the
intellectual
firmament
extraordinary
genius
or
virtue
or
services
may
be
forgotten
for
a
while
but
are
never
permanently
hidden
there
is
always
somebody
to
recall
them
to
our
minds
whether
the
interval
be
short
or
long
the
italian
historian
vico
wrote
a
book
which
attracted
no
attention
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
in
fact
was
forgotten
but
was
made
famous
by
the
discoveries
of
niebuhr
in
the
vatican
library
and
became
the
foundation
of
modern
philosophical
history
some
great
men
pass
out
of
view
for
a
generation
or
two
owing
to
the
bitterness
of
contemporaneous
enemies
and
detractors
and
others
because
of
the
very
unanimity
of
admirers
and
critics
leading
to
no
opposition
we
weary
both
of
praise
and
censure
and
when
either
praise
or
censure
stops
the
object
of
it
is
apparently
forgotten
for
a
time
except
by
the
few
who
are
learned
yet
i
repeat
real
greatness
or
goodness
is
never
completely
hidden
it
reappears
with
new
lustre
when
brought
into
comparison
with
those
who
are
embarked
in
the
same
cause
thus
the
recent
discussions
on
the
education
of
women
recall
to
our
remembrance
the
greatest
woman
who
lived
in
england
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
hannah
more
who
devoted
her
long
and
prosperous
and
honorable
life
to
this
cause
both
by
practical
teaching
and
by
writings
which
arrested
the
attention
and
called
forth
the
admiration
of
the
best
people
in
europe
and
america
she
forestalled
nearly
everything
which
has
been
written
in
our
times
pertaining
to
the
life
of
woman
both
at
school
and
in
society
and
she
evinced
in
her
writings
on
this
great
subject
an
acuteness
of
observation
a
good
sense
a
breadth
and
catholicity
of
judgment
a
richness
of
experience
and
a
high
moral
tone
which
have
never
been
surpassed
she
reminds
us
of
the
wise
madame
de
maintenon
in
her
school
at
cyr
the
pious
and
philanthropic
mary
lyon
at
the
mount
holyoke
seminary
and
the
more
superficial
and
worldly
but
truly
benevolent
and
practical
emma
willard
at
her
institution
in
troy
the
last
two
mentioned
ladies
being
the
pioneers
of
the
advanced
education
for
young
ladies
in
such
colleges
as
vassar
wellesley
and
smith
and
others
i
could
mention
the
wisdom
tact
and
experience
of
madame
de
maintenon
the
first
great
woman
who
gave
a
marked
impulse
to
female
education
in
our
modern
times
were
not
lost
on
hannah
more
who
seems
to
have
laid
down
the
laws
best
adapted
to
develop
the
mind
and
character
of
woman
under
a
high
civilization
england
seems
to
have
been
a
century
in
advance
of
america
both
in
its
wisdom
and
folly
and
the
same
things
in
london
life
were
ridiculed
and
condemned
with
unsparing
boldness
by
hannah
more
which
in
new
york
have
called
out
the
vigorous
protests
of
morgan
dix
the
educators
of
our
age
and
country
can
not
do
better
than
learn
wisdom
from
the
strictures
on
the
modern
system
of
female
education
as
well
as
the
thoughts
on
the
manners
of
the
great
which
appeared
from
the
pen
of
hannah
more
in
the
latter
part
of
the
century
in
which
she
appears
as
both
moralist
and
teacher
getting
inspiration
not
only
from
her
exalted
labors
but
from
the
friendship
and
conversation
of
the
great
intellectual
oracles
of
her
age
i
have
not
read
of
any
one
woman
in
england
for
the
last
fifty
years
i
have
not
heard
or
known
of
any
one
woman
in
the
united
states
who
ever
occupied
the
exalted
position
of
hannah
more
or
who
exercised
so
broad
and
deep
an
influence
on
the
public
mind
in
the
combined
character
of
a
woman
of
society
author
and
philanthropist
there
have
been
since
her
day
more
brilliant
queens
of
fashion
greater
literary
geniuses
and
more
prominent
philanthropists
but
she
was
enabled
to
exercise
an
influence
superior
to
any
of
them
by
her
friendship
with
people
of
rank
by
her
clear
and
powerful
writings
and
by
her
lofty
piety
and
morality
which
blazed
amid
the
vices
of
fashionable
society
one
hundred
years
ago
it
is
well
to
dwell
on
the
life
and
labors
of
so
great
and
good
a
woman
who
has
now
become
historical
but
i
select
her
especially
as
the
representative
of
the
grandest
moral
movement
of
modern
times
that
which
aims
to
develop
the
mind
and
soul
of
woman
and
give
to
her
the
dignity
of
which
she
has
been
robbed
by
paganism
and
philistinism
i
might
have
selected
some
great
woman
nearer
home
and
our
own
time
more
intimately
connected
with
the
profession
of
educating
young
ladies
but
i
prefer
to
speak
of
one
who
is
universally
conceded
to
have
rendered
great
service
to
her
age
and
country
it
is
doubly
pleasant
to
present
hannah
more
because
she
had
none
of
those
defects
and
blemishes
which
have
often
detracted
from
the
dignity
of
great
benefactors
she
was
about
as
perfect
a
woman
as
i
have
read
of
and
her
virtues
were
not
carried
out
to
those
extremes
of
fanaticism
which
have
often
marked
illustrious
saints
from
the
want
of
or
because
of
visionary
theories
strict
and
consistent
as
a
moralist
she
was
never
led
into
any
extravagances
or
fanaticisms
stern
even
as
a
disciplinarian
she
did
not
proscribe
healthy
and
natural
amusements
if
i
may
use
a
modern
contemptuous
phrase
she
never
rebelled
against
the
ordinances
of
nature
or
the
laws
dictated
by
inspiration
she
was
a
model
woman
beautiful
yet
not
vain
witty
yet
never
irreverent
independent
yet
respectful
to
authority
exercising
private
judgment
yet
admired
by
bishops
learned
without
pedantry
hospitable
without
extravagance
fond
of
the
society
of
the
great
yet
spending
her
life
among
the
poor
alive
to
the
fascinations
of
society
yet
consecrating
all
her
energies
of
mind
and
body
to
the
good
of
those
with
whom
she
was
brought
in
contact
as
capable
of
friendship
as
paula
as
religious
as
madame
guyon
as
charming
in
conversation
as
récamier
as
practical
as
elizabeth
as
broad
and
tolerant
as
fénelon
who
was
himself
half
woman
in
his
nature
as
the
most
interesting
men
of
genius
are
apt
to
be
nothing
cynical
or
bitter
or
extravagant
or
contemptuous
appears
in
any
of
her
writings
most
of
which
were
published
anonymously
from
humility
as
well
as
sensitiveness
vanity
was
a
stranger
to
her
as
well
as
arrogance
and
pride
embarking
in
great
enterprises
she
never
went
outside
the
prescribed
sphere
of
woman
masculine
in
the
force
and
vigor
of
her
understanding
she
was
feminine
in
all
her
instincts
proper
amiable
and
gentle
a
woman
whom
everybody
loved
and
everybody
respected
even
to
kings
and
queens
hannah
more
was
born
in
a
little
village
near
bristol
and
her
father
was
the
village
schoolmaster
he
had
been
well
educated
and
had
large
expectations
but
he
was
disappointed
and
was
obliged
to
resort
to
this
useful
but
irksome
way
of
getting
a
living
he
had
five
daughters
of
whom
hannah
was
the
fourth
as
a
girl
she
was
very
precocious
in
mind
as
well
as
beautiful
and
attractive
in
her
person
she
studied
latin
when
only
eight
years
of
age
her
father
it
would
seem
was
a
very
sensible
man
and
sought
to
develop
the
peculiar
talents
which
each
of
his
daughters
possessed
without
the
usual
partiality
of
parents
who
are
apt
to
mistake
inclination
for
genius
three
of
the
girls
had
an
aptitude
for
teaching
and
opened
a
in
bristol
when
the
oldest
was
only
twenty
the
school
was
a
great
success
and
soon
became
fashionable
and
ultimately
famous
to
this
school
the
early
labors
of
hannah
more
were
devoted
and
she
soon
attracted
attention
by
her
accomplishments
especially
in
the
modern
languages
in
which
she
conversed
with
great
accuracy
and
facility
but
her
talents
were
more
remarkable
than
her
accomplishments
and
eminent
men
sought
her
society
and
friendship
who
in
turn
introduced
her
to
their
own
circle
of
friends
by
all
of
whom
she
was
admired
thus
she
gradually
came
to
know
the
celebrated
dean
tucker
of
gloucester
cathedral
ferguson
the
astronomer
then
lecturing
at
bristol
the
elder
sheridan
also
giving
lectures
on

in
the
same
city

on
the
eve
of
his
retirement
from
the
stage
johnson

reynolds
montagu
in
whose
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
age
assembled
as
the
headquarters
of

then

for
bristol
in
the

gibbon

cadell
the
great
publisher
bishop
porteus
rev
john
newton
and
sir
james
stonehouse
an
eminent
physician
with
all
these
stars
she
was
on
intimate
terms
visiting
them
at
their
houses
received
by
them
all
as
more
than
an
equal
for
she
was
not
only
beautiful
and
witty
but
had
earned
considerable
reputation
for
her
poetry
garrick
particularly
admired
her
as
a
woman
of
genius
and
performed
one
of
her
plays
percy
twenty
successive
nights
at
drury
lane
writing
himself
both
the
prologue
and
the
epilogue
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
when
first
admitted
to
the
choicest
society
of
london
at
the
houses
not
merely
of
literary
men
but
of
great
statesmen
and
nobles
like
lord
camden
lord
spencer
the
duke
of
newcastle
lord
pembroke
lord
granville
and
others
she
was
teaching
in
a
girls
school
at
bristol
and
was
a
young
lady
under
thirty
years
of
age
it
was
as
a
literary
woman
when
literary
women
were
not
so
numerous
or
ambitious
as
they
now
are
that
hannah
more
had
the
into
the
best
society
under
the
patronage
of
the
greatest
writers
of
the
age
she
was
a
literary
lion
before
she
was
she
attracted
the
attention
of
sheridan
by
her
verses
when
she
was
scarcely
eighteen
her
search
after
happiness
went
through
six
editions
before
the
year
her
tragedy
of
percy
was
translated
into
french
and
german
before
she
was
thirty
and
she
realized
from
the
sale
of
it
the
fatal
falsehood
was
also
much
admired
but
did
not
meet
the
same
success
being
cruelly
attacked
by
envious
rivals
her
bas
bleu
was
praised
by
johnson
in
unmeasured
terms
it
was
for
her
poetry
that
she
was
best
known
from
to
the
period
when
she
lived
in
the
fashionable
and
literary
world
and
which
she
adorned
by
her
wit
and
brilliant
conversation
not
exactly
a
queen
of
society
since
she
did
not
set
up
a
but
was
only
an
honored
visitor
at
the
houses
of
the
great
a
brilliant
and
beautiful
woman
whom
everybody
wished
to
know
i
will
not
attempt
any
criticism
on
those
numerous
poems
they
are
not
much
read
and
valued
in
our
time
they
are
all
after
the
style
of
johnson
and
pope
the
measured
and
artificial
style
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
imitation
of
the
ancient
classics
and
of
french
poetry
in
which
the
wearisome
rhyme
is
the
chief
peculiarity
smooth
polished
elaborate
but
pretty
much
after
the
same
pattern
and
easily
imitated
by
the
taste
of
this
age
created
by
burns
byron
wordsworth
browning
tennyson
longfellow
and
others
is
very
different
but
the
poems
of
hannah
more
were
undoubtedly
admired
by
her
generation
and
gave
her
great
and
considerable
pecuniary
emolument
and
yet
her
real
fame
does
not
rest
on
those
artificial
poems
respectable
as
they
were
one
hundred
years
ago
but
on
her
writings
as
a
moralist
and
educator
during
this
period
of
her
life
from
to
she
chiefly
resided
with
her
sisters
in
bristol
but
made
long
visits
to
london
and
to
the
houses
of
famous
or
titled
personages
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
these
years
were
the
most
brilliant
but
not
most
useful
period
of
her
life
at
first
she
was
intoxicated
by
the
magnificent
attentions
she
received
and
had
an
intense
enjoyment
of
cultivated
society
it
was
in
these
years
she
formed
the
most
ardent
friendships
of
her
life
of
all
her
friends
she
seems
to
have
been
most
attached
to
garrick
the
idol
of
society
a
general
favorite
wherever
he
chose
to
go
a
man
of
irreproachable
morals
and
charming
conversational
powers
at
whose
house
and
table
no
actor
or
actress
was
ever
known
to
be
invited
except
in
one
solitary
instance
from
which
it
would
appear
that
he
was
more
desirous
of
the
attentions
of
the
great
than
of
the
sympathy
and
admiration
of
the
people
of
his
own
profession
it
is
not
common
for
actors
to
be
gifted
with
great
conversational
powers
any
more
than
for
artists
as
a
general
thing
to
be
people
especially
in
history
hannah
more
was
exceedingly
intimate
with
both
garrick
and
his
wife
and
his
death
in
saddened
and
softened
his
great
worshipper
after
his
death
she
never
was
present
at
any
theatrical
amusement
she
would
not
go
to
the
theatre
to
witness
the
acting
of
her
own
dramas
not
even
to
see
siddons
when
she
appeared
as
so
brilliant
a
star
in
fact
after
garrick
death
miss
more
partially
abandoned
fashionable
society
having
acquired
a
disgust
of
its
heartless
frivolities
and
seductive
vices
with
the
death
of
garrick
a
new
era
opened
in
the
life
of
hannah
more
although
for
the
succeeding
five
years
she
still
was
a
frequent
visitor
in
the
houses
of
those
she
esteemed
both
literary
lions
and
people
of
rank
it
would
seem
during
this
period
that
johnson
was
her
warmest
friend
whom
she
ever
respected
for
his
lofty
moral
nature
and
before
whom
she
bowed
down
in
humble
worship
as
an
intellectual
dictator
he
called
her
his
child
sometimes
he
was
severe
on
her
when
she
differed
from
him
in
opinion
or
when
caught
praising
books
which
he
as
a
moralist
abhorred
like
the
novels
of
fielding
and
smollet
for
the
only
novelist
he
could
tolerate
was
richardson
once
when
she
warmly
expatiated
in
praise
of
the
jansenists
the
overbearing
autocrat
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
thunder
madam
let
me
hear
no
more
of
this
do
quote
your
popish
authorities
to
me
i
want
none
of
your
popery
but
seeing
that
his
friend
was
overwhelmed
with
the
shock
he
gave
her
his
countenance
instantly
changed
his
lip
quivered
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
gently
took
her
hand
and
with
the
deepest
emotion
exclaimed
child
never
mind
what
i
have
said
follow
true
piety
wherever
you
find
it
this
anecdote
is
a
key
to
the
whole
character
of
johnson
interesting
and
uninteresting
for
this
rough
tyrannical
dogmatist
was
also
one
of
the
tenderest
of
men
and
had
a
soul
as
impressible
as
that
of
a
woman
the
most
intimate
woman
friend
it
would
seem
that
hannah
ever
had
was
garrick
both
before
and
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
the
wife
of
garrick
was
a
roman
catholic
hannah
more
usually
spent
several
months
with
this
accomplished
and
woman
at
her
house
in
hampton
generally
from
march
to
july
this
was
often
her
home
during
the
london
season
after
which
she
resided
in
bristol
with
her
sisters
who
made
a
fortune
by
their
after
hannah
had
entered
into
the
literary
field
she
supported
herself
by
her
writings
which
until
were
chiefly
poems
and
dramas
now
almost
forgotten
but
which
were
widely
circulated
and
admired
in
her
day
and
by
which
she
kept
her
position
in
fashionable
and
learned
society
after
the
death
of
garrick
as
we
have
said
she
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
disgust
of
the
gay
and
fashionable
society
which
at
one
time
was
so
fascinating
she
found
it
frivolous
vain
and
even
dull
she
craved
sympathy
and
intellectual
conversation
and
knowledge
she
found
neither
at
a
fashionable
party
only
outside
show
gay
dresses
and
unspeakable
follies
no
conversation
for
how
could
there
be
either
the
cultivation
of
friendship
or
conversation
in
a
crowd
perchance
of
empty
people
for
the
most
part
as
to
london
says
she
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
out
of
it
everything
is
great
and
vast
and
late
and
magnificent
and
dull
i
very
seldom
go
to
these
parties
and
i
always
repent
when
i
do
my
distaste
of
these
scenes
of
insipid
magnificence
i
have
not
words
to
tell
every
faculty
but
the
sight
is
starved
and
that
has
a
surfeit
i
like
conversation
parties
of
the
right
sort
whether
of
four
persons
or
forty
but
it
is
impossible
to
talk
when
two
or
three
hundred
people
are
continually
coming
in
and
popping
out
or
nailing
themselves
to
a
card
table
conceive
said
she
of
the
insipidity
of
two
or
three
hundred
people
all
dressed
in
the
extremity
of
fashion
painted
as
red
as
bacchanals
poisoning
the
air
with
perfumes
treading
on
each
dresses
not
one
in
ten
able
to
get
a
chair
when
fainting
with
weariness
i
never
now
go
to
these
things
when
i
can
possibly
avoid
it
and
stay
when
there
as
few
minutes
as
i
can
thus
she
wrote
as
early
as
she
went
through
the
same
experience
as
did
madame
récamier
learning
to
prefer
a
small
and
select
circle
where
conversation
was
the
chief
charm
especially
when
this
circle
was
composed
only
of
gifted
men
and
women
in
this
incipient
disgust
of
gay
and
worldly
society
chiefly
because
it
improved
neither
her
mind
nor
her
morals
because
it
was
stupid
and
dull
as
it
generally
is
to
people
of
real
culture
and
high
intelligence
she
seems
to
have
been
gradually
drawn
to
the
learned
prelates
of
the
english
church
like
porteus
bishop
of
chester
afterwards
of
london
the
bishop
of
asaph
and
home
then
dean
of
canterbury
she
became
very
intimate
with
wilberforce
and
rev
john
newton
while
she
did
not
give
up
her
friendship
for
horace
walpole
pepys
and
other
lights
of
the
social
world
about
this
time
she
retired
to
cowslip
green
a
pretty
cottage
ten
miles
from
bristol
and
spent
her
time
in
reading
writing
and
gardening
the
country
with
its
green
pastures
and
still
waters
called
her
back
to
those
studies
and
duties
which
are
most
ennobling
and
which
produce
the
most
lasting
pleasure
in
this
humble
retreat
she
had
many
visitors
from
among
her
illustrious
friends
she
became
more
and
more
religious
without
entirely
giving
up
society
corresponding
with
the
eminent
men
and
women
she
visited
especially
montagu
porteus
boscawen
pepys
and
rev
john
newton
in
the
charming
seclusion
of
cowslip
green
she
wrote
her
treatise
on
the
manners
of
the
great
the
first
of
that
series
in
which
she
rebuked
the
fashions
and
follies
of
the
day
it
had
an
immense
circulation
and
was
published
anonymously
this
very
popular
work
was
followed
in
by
a
volume
on
an
estimate
of
the
religion
of
the
fashionable
world
which
produced
a
still
deeper
sensation
among
the
great
and
was
much
admired
the
bishop
of
london
porteus
was
full
of
its
praises
so
was
john
newton
although
he
did
not
think
that
any
book
could
wean
the
worldly
from
their
pleasures
thus
far
most
of
the
associations
of
hannah
more
had
been
with
the
fashionable
world
by
which
she
was
petted
and
flattered
seeing
clearly
its
faults
she
had
sought
to
reform
it
by
her
writings
and
by
her
conversation
but
now
she
turned
her
attention
to
another
class
the
poor
and
ignorant
and
labored
for
them
she
instituted
a
number
of
schools
for
the
poor
in
her
immediate
neighborhood
superintended
them
raised
money
for
them
and
directed
them
as
madame
de
maintenon
did
the
school
of
cyr
only
with
this
difference
that
while
the
frenchwoman
sought
to
develop
the
mind
and
character
of
a
set
of
aristocratic
girls
to
offset
the
practical
infidelity
that
permeated
the
upper
walks
of
life
hannah
more
desired
to
make
the
children
of
the
poor
religious
amid
the
savage
profligacy
which
then
marked
the
peasant
class
the
first
school
she
established
was
at
cheddar
a
wild
and
sunless
hollow
amid
yawning
caverns
about
ten
miles
from
cowslip
green
the
resort
of
pleasure
parties
for
its
picturesque
cliffs
and
fissures
around
this
weird
spot
was
perhaps
the
most
degraded
peasantry
to
be
found
in
england
without
even
spiritual
instruction
for
the
vicar
was
a
and
his
living
was
worth
but
a
year
in
her
efforts
to
establish
a
school
in
such
a
barbarous
and
pagan
locality
hannah
met
with
serious
obstacles
the
farmers
and
petty
landholders
were
hostile
to
her
scheme
maintaining
that
any
education
would
spoil
the
poor
and
make
them
discontented
even
the
farmers
themselves
were
an
ignorant
and
brutal
class
very
depraved
and
with
intense
prejudices
for
a
whole
year
she
labored
with
them
to
disarm
their
hostilities
and
prejudices
and
succeeded
at
last
in
collecting
two
hundred
and
fifty
children
in
the
schoolhouse
which
she
had
built
their
instruction
was
of
course
only
elemental
but
it
was
religious
from
cheddar
hannah
more
was
led
to
examine
into
the
condition
of
neighboring
places
thirteen
contiguous
parishes
were
without
a
resident
curate
and
nine
of
these
were
furnished
with
schools
with
over
five
hundred
scholars
her
theory
was
a
suitable
education
for
each
and
a
christian
education
for
all
while
she
was
much
encouraged
by
her
ecclesiastical
aristocratic
friends
she
still
encountered
great
opposition
from
the
farmers
she
also
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
dissenters
for
thus
invading
the
territory
of
ignorance
all
her
movements
were
subjected
to
prelates
and
clergymen
of
the
church
of
england
for
their
approval
for
she
put
herself
under
their
patronage
and
yet
the
brutal
ignorance
of
the
peasantry
was
owing
in
part
to
the
neglect
of
these
very
clergymen
who
never
visited
these
poor
people
under
their
charge
as
an
excuse
for
them
it
may
be
said
that
at
that
time
there
were
parishes
in
england
and
wales
in
which
a
clergyman
could
not
reside
if
he
would
for
lack
of
a
parsonage
at
that
time
even
in
puritan
new
england
every
minister
was
supposed
to
live
in
a
parsonage
not
one
parish
in
ten
is
provided
with
that
desirable
auxiliary
not
only
were
the
labors
of
hannah
more
extended
to
the
ignorant
and
degraded
by
the
establishment
of
schools
in
her
neighborhood
at
an
expense
of
about
a
year
part
of
which
she
contributed
herself
but
she
employed
her
pen
in
their
behalf
writing
at
the
solicitation
of
the
bishop
of
london
a
series
of
papers
or
tracts
for
the
times
with
special
reference
to
the
enlightenment
of
the
lower
classes
on
those
subjects
that
were
then
agitating
the
country
the
whole
land
was
at
this
time
inundated
with
pamphlets
full
of
infidelity
and
discontent
fanned
by
the
french
revolution
then
passing
through
its
worst
stages
of
cruelty
atheism
and
spoliation
burke
about
the
same
time
wrote
his
reflections
which
are
immortal
for
their
wisdom
and
profundity
but
he
wrote
for
the
upper
classes
not
merely
in
england
but
in
america
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
hannah
more
wrote
for
the
lower
classes
and
in
a
style
of
great
clearness
and
simplicity
her
admirable
dialogue
called
village
politics
by
will
chip
a
country
carpenter
exposed
the
folly
and
atrocity
of
the
revolutionary
doctrines
then
in
vogue
its
circulation
was
immense
the
government
purchased
several
thousand
copies
for
distribution
it
was
translated
into
french
and
italian
similar
in
spirit
was
the
tract
in
reply
to
the
infidel
speech
of
dupont
in
the
french
convention
in
which
he
would
divorce
all
religion
from
education
the
circulation
of
this
tract
was
also
very
great
these
were
followed
in
by
the
cheap
repository
a
periodical
designed
for
the
poor
with
religious
tales
most
of
which
have
since
been
published
by
tract
societies
among
them
the
famous
story
of
the
shepherd
of
salisbury
plain
the
cheap
repository
was
continued
for
three
years
and
circulated
in
every
village
and
hamlet
of
england
and
america
it
almost
equalled
the
popularity
of
the
progress
two
millions
of
these
tracts
were
sold
in
the
first
year
in
hannah
more
great
work
entitled
strictures
on
the
modern
system
of
female
education
appeared
which
passed
through
twenty
editions
in
a
few
years
it
was
her
third
ethical
publication
in
prose
and
the
most
powerful
of
all
her
writings
testimonies
as
to
its
value
poured
in
upon
her
from
every
quarter
nothing
was
more
talked
about
at
that
time
except
perhaps
robert
hall
sermons
it
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
works
of
its
kind
that
any
country
or
age
had
produced
it
made
as
deep
an
impression
on
the
english
mind
as
the
émile
of
rousseau
did
on
the
french
half
a
century
earlier
but
was
vastly
higher
in
its
moral
tone
i
know
of
no
treatise
on
education
so
full
and
so
sensible
as
this
it
ought
to
be
reprinted
for
the
benefit
of
this
generation
for
its
author
has
forestalled
all
subsequent
writers
on
this
subject
there
is
scarcely
anything
said
by
rev
morgan
dix
in
his
excellent
lenten
lectures
which
was
not
said
by
hannah
more
in
the
last
century
herbert
spencer
may
be
more
original
possibly
more
profound
but
he
is
not
so
practical
or
clear
or
instructive
as
the
great
woman
who
preceded
him
more
than
half
a
century
the
fundamental
principle
which
underlies
all
hannah
more
theories
of
education
is
the
necessity
of
christian
instruction
which
herbert
spencer
says
very
little
about
and
apparently
ignores
she
would
not
divorce
education
from
religion
women
especially
owe
their
elevation
entirely
to
christianity
hence
its
influence
should
be
paramount
to
exalt
the
soul
as
well
as
enlarge
the
mind
all
sound
education
should
prepare
one
for
the
duties
of
life
rather
than
for
the
enjoyment
of
its
pleasures
what
good
can
i
do
should
be
the
first
inquiry
it
is
christianity
alone
that
teaches
the
ultimate
laws
of
morals
hannah
more
would
subject
every
impulse
and
every
pursuit
and
every
study
to
these
ultimate
laws
as
a
foundation
for
true
and
desirable
knowledge
she
would
repress
everything
which
looks
like
vanity
she
would
educate
girls
for
their
homes
and
not
for
a
crowd
for
usefulness
and
not
for
admiration
for
that
period
of
life
when
external
beauty
is
faded
or
lost
she
thinks
more
highly
of
solid
attainments
than
of
accomplishments
and
would
incite
to
useful
rather
than
unnecessary
works
she
would
have
a
girl
learn
the
languages
though
she
deems
them
of
little
value
unless
one
can
think
in
them
she
would
cultivate
that
sensibility
which
has
its
seat
in
the
heart
rather
than
the
nerves
anything
which
detracts
from
modesty
and
delicacy
and
makes
a
girl
bold
forward
and
pushing
she
severely
rebukes
she
would
check
all
extravagance
in
dancing
and
would
not
waste
much
time
on
music
unless
one
has
a
talent
for
it
she
thinks
that
the
excessive
cultivation
of
the
arts
has
contributed
to
the
decline
of
states
she
is
severe
on
that
style
of
dress
which
permits
an
indelicate
exposure
of
the
person
and
on
all
forms
of
senseless
extravagance
she
despises
children
balls
and
ridicules
children
rights
and
liliputian
coquetry
with
ribbons
and
feathers
she
would
educate
women
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
daughters
wives
and
mothers
rather
than
to
make
them
dancers
singers
players
painters
and
actresses
she
maintains
that
when
a
man
of
sense
comes
to
marry
he
wants
a
companion
rather
than
a
creature
who
can
only
dress
and
dance
and
play
upon
an
instrument
yet
she
does
not
discourage
ornamental
talent
she
admits
it
is
a
good
thing
but
not
the
best
thing
that
a
woman
has
she
would
not
cut
up
time
into
an
endless
multiplicity
of
employments
she
urges
mothers
to
impress
on
their
daughters
minds
a
discriminating
estimate
of
personal
beauty
so
that
they
may
not
have
their
heads
turned
by
the
adulation
that
men
are
so
prone
to
lavish
on
those
who
are
beautiful
while
she
deprecates
harshness
she
insists
on
a
rigorous
discipline
she
would
stimulate
industry
and
the
cultivation
of
moderate
abilities
as
more
likely
to
win
in
the
long
race
of
life
even
as
a
barren
soil
and
ungenial
climate
have
generally
produced
the
most
thrifty
people
she
would
banish
frivolous
books
which
give
only
superficial
knowledge
and
even
those
abridgments
and
compendiums
which
form
too
considerable
a
part
of
ordinary
libraries
and
recommends
instead
those
works
which
exercise
the
reasoning
faculties
and
stir
up
the
powers
of
the
mind
she
expresses
great
contempt
for
english
sentimentality
french
philosophy
italian
poetry
and
german
mysticism
and
is
scarcely
less
severe
on
the
novels
of
her
day
which
stimulate
the
imagination
without
adding
to
knowledge
she
recommends
history
as
the
most
improving
of
all
studies
both
as
a
revelation
of
the
ways
of
providence
and
as
tending
to
the
enlargement
of
the
mind
she
insists
on
accuracy
in
language
and
on
avoiding
exaggerations
she
inculcates
with
man
and
not
rivalry
or
struggle
for
power
what
she
says
about
rights
which
it
seems
was
a
question
that
agitated
even
her
age
is
worth
quoting
since
it
is
a
woman
and
not
a
man
who
speaks
is
it
not
more
wise
to
move
contentedly
in
the
plain
path
which
providence
has
obviously
marked
out
for
the
sex
and
in
which
custom
has
for
the
most
part
rationally
confirmed
them
rather
than
to
stray
awkwardly
unbecomingly
unsuccessfully
in
a
forbidden
road
to
be
the
lawful
possessors
of
a
lesser
domestic
territory
rather
than
the
turbulent
usurpers
of
a
wider
foreign
empire
to
be
good
originals
rather
than
bad
imitators
to
be
the
best
thing
of
one
kind
rather
than
an
inferior
thing
even
if
it
were
of
a
higher
kind
to
be
excellent
women
rather
than
indifferent
men
let
not
woman
view
with
envy
the
keen
satirist
hunting
vice
through
all
the
doublings
and
windings
of
the
heart
the
sagacious
politician
leading
senates
and
directing
the
fate
of
empires
the
acute
lawyer
detecting
the
obliquities
of
fraud
or
the
skilful
dramatist
exposing
the
pretensions
of
folly
but
let
her
remember
that
those
who
thus
excel
to
all
that
nature
bestows
and
books
can
teach
must
add
besides
that
consummate
knowledge
of
the
world
to
which
a
delicate
woman
has
no
fair
avenues
and
which
even
if
she
could
attain
she
would
never
be
supposed
to
have
come
honestly
by
women
possess
in
a
high
degree
that
delicacy
and
quickness
of
perception
and
that
nice
discernment
between
the
beautiful
and
defective
which
comes
under
the
denomination
of
taste
both
in
composition
and
action
they
excel
in
details
but
they
do
not
so
much
generalize
their
ideas
as
men
nor
do
their
minds
seize
a
great
subject
with
so
large
a
grasp
they
are
acute
observers
and
accurate
judges
of
life
and
manners
so
far
as
their
own
sphere
of
observation
extends
but
they
describe
a
smaller
circle
and
they
have
a
certain
tact
which
enables
them
to
feel
what
is
just
more
instantaneously
than
they
can
define
it
they
have
an
intuitive
penetration
into
character
bestowed
upon
them
by
providence
like
the
sensitive
and
tender
organs
of
some
timid
animals
as
a
kind
of
natural
guard
to
warn
of
the
approach
of
danger
beings
who
are
often
called
to
act
defensively
but
whatever
characteristic
distinctions
may
exist
between
man
and
woman
there
is
one
great
and
leading
circumstance
which
raises
woman
and
establishes
her
equality
with
man
christianity
has
exalted
woman
to
true
and
undisputed
dignity
christ
jesus
there
is
neither
rich
nor
poor
bond
nor
free
male
nor
female
so
that
if
we
deny
to
women
the
talents
which
lead
them
to
excel
as
lawyers
they
are
preserved
from
the
peril
of
having
their
principles
warped
by
that
too
indiscriminate
defence
of
right
and
wrong
to
which
the
professors
of
the
law
are
exposed
if
we
question
their
title
to
eminence
as
mathematicians
they
are
exempted
from
the
danger
of
looking
for
demonstration
on
subjects
which
by
their
very
nature
are
incapable
of
affording
it
if
they
are
less
conversant
with
the
powers
of
nature
the
structure
of
the
human
frame
and
the
knowledge
of
the
heavenly
bodies
than
philosophers
physicians
and
astronomers
they
are
delivered
from
the
error
into
which
many
of
each
of
these
have
sometimes
fallen
from
the
fatal
habit
of
resting
on
second
causes
instead
of
referring
all
to
the
first
and
let
women
take
comfort
that
in
their
very
exemption
from
privileges
which
they
are
sometimes
disposed
to
envy
consist
their
security
and
their
happiness
thus
spoke
hannah
more
at
the
age
of
with
a
wider
experience
of
society
and
a
profounder
knowledge
of
her
sex
than
any
englishwoman
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
as
distinguished
for
her
intellectual
gifts
and
cultivation
as
she
was
for
her
social
graces
and
charms
the
pet
and
admiration
of
all
who
were
great
and
good
in
her
day
both
among
men
and
women
bear
these
facts
in
mind
ye
obscure
inexperienced
discontented
envious
ambitious
seekers
after
notoriety
or
novelty
ye
rebellious
and
defiant
opponents
of
the
ordinances
of
god
and
the
laws
of
nature
if
such
women
there
are
remember
that
the
sentiments
i
have
just
quoted
came
from
the
pen
of
a
woman
and
not
of
a
man
of
a
woman
who
was
the
best
friend
of
her
sex
and
the
most
enlightened
advocate
of
their
education
that
lived
in
the
last
century
and
a
woman
who
if
she
were
living
now
would
undoubtedly
be
classed
with
those
whom
we
call
and
perhaps
masculine
and
ambitious
she
recognizes
the
eternal
distinction
between
the
sphere
of
a
man
and
the
sphere
of
a
woman
without
admitting
any
inferiority
of
woman
to
man
except
in
physical
strength
and
a
sort
of
masculine
power
of
generalization
and
grasp
and
would
educate
woman
for
her
own
sphere
not
for
the
sphere
of
man
whatever
christianity
or
experience
or
reason
may
define
that
sphere
to
be
she
would
make
woman
useful
interesting
lofty
she
would
give
dignity
to
her
soul
she
would
make
her
the
friend
and
helpmate
of
man
not
his
rival
she
would
make
her
a
christian
woman
since
with
christian
virtues
and
graces
and
principles
she
will
not
be
led
astray
but
i
would
not
dwell
on
ground
which
may
be
controverted
and
which
to
some
may
appear
discourteous
or
discouraging
to
those
noble
women
who
are
doomed
by
dire
and
hard
misfortunes
by
terrible
necessities
to
labor
in
some
fields
which
have
been
assigned
to
man
and
in
which
departments
they
have
earned
the
admiration
and
respect
of
men
themselves
this
subject
is
only
one
in
a
hundred
which
hannah
more
discussed
with
clearness
power
and
wisdom
she
is
equally
valuable
and
impressive
in
what
she
says
of
conversation
a
realm
in
which
she
had
no
superior
hear
what
she
says
about
this
gift
or
art
do
we
wish
to
see
women
take
a
lead
in
metaphysical
disquisitions
to
plunge
in
the
depths
of
theological
polemics
do
we
wish
to
enthrone
them
in
the
chairs
of
our
universities
to
deliver
oracles
harangues
and
dissertations
do
we
desire
to
behold
them
inflated
with
their
original
powers
laboring
to
strike
out
sparks
of
wit
with
a
restless
anxiety
to
shine
and
with
a
labored
affectation
to
please
which
never
pleases
all
this
be
far
from
them
but
we
wish
to
see
the
conversation
of
women
rescued
from
vapid
commonplaces
from
uninteresting
tattle
from
trite
communications
from
frivolous
earnestness
from
false
sensibility
from
a
warm
interest
about
things
of
no
moment
and
an
indifference
to
topics
the
most
important
from
a
cold
vanity
from
the
overflows
of
exhibiting
itself
under
the
smiling
mask
of
an
engaging
flattery
and
from
all
the
factitious
manners
of
artificial
intercourse
we
wish
to
see
the
time
passed
in
polished
and
intelligent
society
considered
as
the
pleasant
portion
of
our
existence
and
not
consigned
to
premeditated
trifling
and
systematic
unprofitableness
women
too
little
live
or
converse
up
to
their
understandings
and
however
we
deprecate
affectation
and
pedantry
let
it
be
remembered
that
both
in
reading
and
conversing
the
understanding
gains
more
by
stretching
than
stooping
the
mind
by
applying
itself
to
objects
below
its
level
contracts
and
shrinks
itself
to
the
size
of
the
object
about
which
it
is
conversant
in
the
faculty
of
speaking
well
ladies
have
such
a
happy
promptitude
of
turning
their
slender
advantages
to
account
that
though
never
taught
a
rule
of
syntax
they
hardly
ever
violate
one
and
often
possess
an
elegant
arrangement
of
style
without
having
studied
any
of
the
laws
of
composition
and
yet
they
are
too
ready
to
produce
not
only
pedantic
expressions
but
crude
notions
and
hackneyed
remarks
with
all
the
vanity
of
conscious
discovery
and
all
from
reading
mere
abridgments
and
scanty
sketches
rather
than
exhausting
subjects
equally
forcible
are
her
remarks
on
society
perhaps
said
she
the
interests
of
friendship
elegant
conversation
and
true
social
pleasure
never
received
such
a
blow
as
when
fashion
issued
the
decree
that
must
be
acquainted
with
the
decline
of
instructive
conversation
has
been
effected
in
a
great
measure
by
the
barbarous
habit
of
assembly
where
one
hears
the
same
succession
of
unmeaning
platitudes
mutual
insincerities
and
aimless
inquiries
it
would
be
trite
however
to
dwell
on
the
vapid
talk
which
must
almost
of
necessity
mark
those
who
assemble
in
crowds
and
which
we
are
taught
to
call
society
which
really
can
not
exist
without
the
free
interchange
of
thought
and
sentiment
hence
society
only
truly
shines
in
small
and
select
circles
of
people
of
high
intelligence
who
are
drawn
together
by
friendship
as
well
as
admiration
about
two
years
after
this
work
on
education
appeared
education
in
the
broadest
sense
pertaining
to
woman
at
home
and
in
society
as
well
as
at
school
hannah
more
moved
from
her
little
thatched
cottage
and
built
barley
wood
a
large
villa
where
she
could
entertain
the
increasing
circle
of
her
friends
who
were
at
this
period
only
the
learned
the
pious
and
the
distinguished
especially
bishops
like
porteus
and
horne
and
philanthropists
like
wilberforce
the
beauty
of
this
new
residence
amid
woods
and
lawns
attracted
her
sisters
from
bath
who
continued
to
live
with
her
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
to
with
her
in
deeds
of
benevolence
in
this
charming
retreat
she
wrote
perhaps
the
most
famous
of
her
books
coelebs
in
search
of
a
wife
not
much
read
i
fancy
in
these
times
but
admired
in
its
day
before
the
great
revolution
in
was
made
by
sir
walter
scott
yet
this
work
is
no
more
a
novel
than
the
dialogues
of
plato
like
rasselas
it
is
a
treatise
a
narrative
essay
on
the
choice
of
a
wife
the
expansion
and
continuation
of
her
strictures
on
education
and
fashionable
life

in
when
the
writer
was
years
of
age
as
on
former
occasions
she
now
not
only
assumed
an
anonymous
name
but
endeavored
to
hide
herself
under
deeper
incognita

no

with
this

her
literary
career
virtually
closed

were
written
amid
the
pains
of
disease
and
many
distractions
especially
visits
from
distinguished
and
curious
people
which
took
up
her
time
and
sadly
interrupted
her
labors
at
the
age
of
eighty

still
receiving

visitors
continued
to

her
house
to
the

impelled
by
admiration
or
curiosity

she
was
obliged
at
length
to
limit
her
to
the
hours
between
one
and
three
hannah
more
lived
at
barley
wood
nearly
thirty
years
in
dignified
leisure
with
an
ample
revenue
and
in
considerable
style
keeping
her
carriage
and
horses
with
a
large
number
of
servants
dispensing
a
generous
hospitality
and
giving
away
in
charities
a
considerable
part
of
her
income
she
realized
from
her
pen
and
her
sisters
also
had
accumulated
a
fortune
by
their
school
in
bristol
her
property
must
have
been
considerable
since
on
her
death
she
bequeathed
in
charities
nearly
beside
endowing
a
church
she
spent
about
a
year
in
charities
the
last
few
years
of
her
residence
at
barley
wood
were
disturbed
by
the
ingratitude
and
dishonesty
of
her
servants
they
deceived
and
robbed
her
especially
those
to
whom
she
had
been
most
kind
and
generous
she
was
at
her
advanced
age
entirely
dependent
on
these
servants
so
that
she
could
not
reform
her
establishment
there
was
the
most
shameless
peculation
in
the
kitchen
and
money
given
in
charity
was
appropriated
by
the
servants
who
all
combined
to
cheat
her
out
of
her
sight
they
were
disorderly
they
gave
nocturnal
suppers
to
their
friends
and
drank
up
her
wines
so
she
resolved
to
discharge
the
whole
of
them
and
sell
her
beautiful
place
and
when
she
finally
left
her
home
these
servants
openly
insulted
her
she
removed
to
a
house
in
clifton
where
she
had
equal
comfort
and
fewer
cares
in
this
house
she
spent
the
remaining
four
years
of
her
useful
life
dispensing
charities
and
entertaining
the
numerous
friends
who
visited
her
and
the
crowd
who
came
to
do
her
honor
she
died
in
september
at
the
age
of
retaining
her
intellectual
faculties
like
madame
de
maintenon
nearly
to
the
last
she
was
buried
with
great
honors
a
beautiful
monument
was
erected
to
her
memory
in
the
parish
church
where
her
mortal
remains
were
laid
the
subscription
to
this
monument
being
five
times
greater
than
the
sum
needed
hannah
more
was
strongly
attached
to
the
church
of
england
and
upheld
the
authority
of
the
established
religious
institutions
of
the
country
she
excited
some
hostility
from
the
liberality
of
her
views
for
she
would
occasionally
frequent
the
chapels
of
the
dissenters
and
partake
of
their
communion
she
was
supposed
by
many
to
lean
towards
methodism
as
everybody
was
accused
of
doing
in
the
last
century
in
england
who
led
a
strictly
religious
life
she
was
evangelical
in
her
views
but
was
not
calvinistic
nor
was
she
a
believer
in
instantaneous
conversions
any
more
than
she
was
in
baptismal
regeneration
she
contributed
liberally
to
religious
and
philanthropic
societies
the
best
book
she
thought
that
was
ever
published
was
jeremy
taylor
holy
living
and
dying
but
her
opinion
was
that
john
howe
was
a
greater
man
she
was
a
great
admirer
of
shakspeare
whom
she
placed
on
the
highest
pedestal
of
human
genius
she
also
admired
sir
walter
scott
poetry
especially
marmion
she
admitted
the
genius
of
byron
but
had
such
detestation
of
his
character
that
she
would
not
read
his
poetry
the
best
and
greatest
part
of
the
life
of
hannah
more
was
devoted
to
the
education
and
elevation
of
her
sex
her
most
valuable
writings
were
educational
and
moral
her
popularity
did
not
wane
with
advancing
years
no
literary
woman
ever
had
warmer
friends
and
these
she
retained
she
never
lost
a
friend
except
by
death
she
had
to
lament
over
no
broken
friendships
since
her
friendships
were
based
on
respect
and
affection
her
nature
must
have
been
very
genial
for
so
strict
a
woman
in
her
religious
duties
she
was
very
tolerant
of
human
infirmities
she
was
faithful
in
reproof
but
having
once
given
her
friendship
she
held
on
to
it
with
great
tenacity
she
clung
to
the
worldly
horace
walpole
as
she
did
to
johnson
the
most
intimate
woman
friend
of
her
long
life
was
a
catholic
hannah
was
never
married
which
was
not
her
fault
for
she
was
jilted
by
the
man
she
loved
for
whom
however
she
is
said
to
have
retained
a
friendly
feeling
to
the
last
though
unmarried
she
was
addressed
as
not
miss
more
and
she
seems
to
have
insisted
on
this
which
i
think
was
a
weakness
since
the
dignity
of
her
character
her
fame
and
high
social
position
needed
no
conventional
crutch
to
make
her
appear
more
matronly
as
a
mere
fashionable
woman
of
society
her
name
would
never
have
descended
to
our
times
as
a
moralist
she
is
immortal
so
far
as
any
writer
can
be
as
an
author
i
do
not
regard
her
as
a
great
original
genius
but
her
successful
and
honorable
career
shows
how
much
may
be
done
by
industry
and
perseverance
her
memory
is
kept
especially
fresh
from
the
interest
she
took
in
the
education
of
her
sex
and
from
her
wise
and
sage
counsels
based
on
religion
and
a
wide
experience
no
woman
ever
had
better
opportunities
for
the
study
of
her
sex
or
more
nobly
improved
them
she
was
the
most
enlightened
advocate
of
a
high
education
for
women
that
her
age
and
even
her
century
produced
now
what
is
meant
by
a
high
education
for
women
for
in
our
times
the
opinions
of
people
in
regard
to
this
matter
are
far
from
being
harmonious
indeed
on
no
subject
is
there
more
disagreement
there
is
no
subject
which
provokes
more
bitter
and
hostile
comments
there
is
no
subject
on
which
both
men
and
women
wrangle
with
more
acerbity
even
when
they
are
virtually
agreed
for
the
instincts
of
good
women
are
really
in
accord
with
the
profoundest
experience
and
reason
of
men
in
the
few
remarks
to
which
i
am
now
limited
i
shall
not
discuss
the
irritating
and
disputed
question
of
of
the
sexes
which
can
only
be
settled
by
experience
on
this
subject
we
have
not
yet
sufficient
facts
for
a
broad
induction
on
the
one
hand
it
would
seem
that
so
long
as
young
men
and
women
mingle
freely
together
in
amusements
at
parties
and
balls
at
the
theatre
and
opera
in
the
in
churches
and
most
public
meetings
it
is
not
probable
that
any
practical
evils
can
result
from
educational
competition
of
the
two
sexes
in
the
same
especially
when
we
consider
that
many
eminent
educators
have
given
their
testimony
in
its
favor
so
far
as
it
has
fallen
under
their
observation
and
experience
but
on
the
other
hand
the
of
the
sexes
may
imply
that
both
girls
and
boys
by
similarity
of
studies
are
to
be
educated
for
the
same
sphere
boys
study
the
higher
mathematics
not
merely
for
mental
discipline
but
in
order
to
be
engineers
astronomers
surveyors
and
the
like
so
too
they
study
chemistry
in
its
higher
branches
to
be
chemists
and
physicians
and
miners
if
girls
wish
to
do
this
rough
work
let
them
know
that
they
seek
to
do
men
work
if
they
are
to
do
women
work
it
would
seem
that
they
should
give
more
attention
to
music
the
modern
languages
and
ornamental
branches
than
boys
do
since
few
men
pursue
these
things
as
a
business
the
question
is
is
it
wise
for
boys
and
girls
to
pursue
the
same
studies
in
the
more
difficult
branches
of
knowledge
i
would
withhold
no
study
from
a
woman
on
the
ground
of
assumed
intellectual
inferiority
i
believe
that
a
woman
can
grasp
any
subject
as
well
as
a
man
can
so
far
and
so
long
as
her
physical
strength
will
permit
her
to
make
exhaustive
researches
there
are
some
studies
which
task
the
physical
strength
of
men
to
its
utmost
tension
if
any
woman
has
equal
physical
power
with
men
to
master
certain
subjects
let
her
pursue
them
for
success
even
with
men
depends
upon
physical
endurance
as
well
as
and
thus
the
question
is
one
of
physical
strength
and
endurance
and
women
must
settle
for
themselves
whether
they
can
run
races
with
men
in
studies
in
which
only
the
physically
strong
can
hope
to
succeed
then
again
i
would
educate
women
with
reference
to
the
sphere
in
which
they
must
forever
move
a
sphere
settled
by
the
eternal
laws
of
nature
and
duty
against
which
it
is
folly
to
rebel
does
any
one
doubt
or
deny
that
the
sphere
of
women
different
from
the
sphere
of
men
can
it
be
questioned
that
a
class
of
studies
pursued
by
women
who
are
confined
for
a
considerable
period
of
life
to
domestic
duties
like
the
care
of
children
and
the
details
of
household
economy
and
attendance
on
the
sick
and
ornamental
art
labors
should
not
be
different
from
those
pursued
by
men
who
undertake
the
learned
professions
and
the
government
of
the
people
and
the
accumulation
of
wealth
in
the
hard
drudgeries
of
banks
and
and
stores
and
commercial
travelling
there
is
no
way
to
get
round
this
question
except
by
maintaining
that
men
should
not
be
exempted
from
the
cares
and
duties
which
for
all
recorded
ages
have
been
assigned
to
women
and
that
women
should
enter
upon
the
equally
settled
sphere
of
man
and
become
lawyers
politicians
clergymen
members
of
congress
and
of
state
legislatures
sailors
merchants
commercial
travellers
bankers
railway
conductors
and
steamship
captains
i
once
knew
the
discontented
wife
of
an
eminent
painter
with
a
brilliant
intellect
who
insisted
that
her
husband
should
leave
his
studio
and
spend
five
hours
a
day
in
the
drudgeries
of
the
nursery
and
kitchen
to
relieve
her
and
that
she
should
spend
the
five
hours
in
her
studio
as
an
amateur
that
they
thus
might
be
on
an
equality
the
husband
died
in
a
after
dying
for
a
year
with
a
broken
heart
and
a
crushed
ambition
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
his
wife
demand
or
fight
from
morning
to
night
and
from
night
to
morning
and
as
he
was
a
man
of
peace
he
quietly
yielded
up
his
prerogative
do
you
admire
the
one
who
prevailed
over
him
she
belonged
to
that
class
who
are
called
but
she
was
perverted
as
some
noble
minds
are
by
atheistic
and
spiritualistic
views
and
thought
to
raise
women
by
lifting
them
out
of
the
sphere
which
god
has
appointed
if
then
there
be
distinct
spheres
divinely
appointed
for
women
and
for
men
and
an
education
should
be
given
to
fit
them
for
rising
in
their
respective
spheres
the
question
arises
what
studies
shall
woman
pursue
in
order
to
develop
her
mind
and
resources
and
fit
her
for
happiness
and
usefulness
this
question
is
only
to
be
answered
by
those
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
the
education
of
young
ladies
i
would
go
into
no
details
i
would
only
lay
down
the
general
proposition
that
a
woman
should
be
educated
to
be
interesting
both
to
her
own
sex
and
to
men
to
be
useful
in
her
home
to
exercise
the
best
influence
on
her
female
and
male
companions
to
have
her
affections
as
well
as
intellect
developed
to
have
her
soul
elevated
so
as
to
be
kindled
by
lofty
sentiments
and
to
feel
that
there
is
something
higher
than
the
adornment
of
the
person
or
the
attracting
of
attention
in
those
noisy
crowds
which
are
called
society
she
should
be
taught
to
become
the
friend
and
helpmate
of
man
never
his
rival
she
is
to
be
invested
with
those
graces
which
call
out
the
worship
of
man
which
cause
her
to
shine
with
the
radiance
of
the
soul
and
with
those
virtues
which
men
rarely
reach
a
superior
loftiness
of
character
a
greater
purity
of
mind
a
heavenlike
patience
and
magnanimity
she
is
not
an
angel
but
a
woman
yet
she
should
shine
with
angelic
qualities
and
aspire
to
angelic
virtues
and
prove
herself
morally
and
spiritually
to
be
so
superior
to
man
that
he
will
render
to
her
an
instinctive
deference
not
a
mock
and
ironical
deference
because
she
is
supposed
to
be
inferior
and
weak
but
a
real
deference
a
genuine
respect
on
which
all
permanent
friendship
rests
and
even
love
itself
which
every
woman
as
well
as
every
man
craves
from
the
bottom
of
the
soul
and
without
which
life
has
no
object
no
charm
and
no
interest
is
woman
necessarily
made
a
drudge
by
assuming
those
domestic
duties
which
add
so
much
to
the
unity
and
happiness
of
a
family
and
which
a
man
can
not
so
well
discharge
as
he
can
the
more
arduous
labors
of
supporting
a
family
are
her
labors
in
directing
servants
or
educating
her
children
more
irksome
than
the
labors
of
a
man
in
heat
and
cold
often
among
selfish
and
disagreeable
companions
is
woman
in
restricting
herself
to
her
sphere
thereby
debarred
from
the
pleasures
of
literature
and
art
as
a
rule
is
she
not
already
better
educated
than
her
husband
however
domestic
she
may
be
can
not
she
still
paint
and
sing
and
read
and
talk
on
the
grandest
subjects
is
she
not
really
more
privileged
than
her
husband
or
brother
with
more
time
and
less
harassing
cares
and
anxieties
would
she
really
exchange
her
graceful
labors
for
the
rough
and
turbulent
work
of
men
but
here
i
am
stopped
with
the
inquiry
what
will
you
do
with
those
women
who
are
unfortunate
who
have
no
bright
homes
to
adorn
no
means
of
support
no
children
to
instruct
no
husbands
to
rule
women
cast
out
of
the
sphere
where
they
would
like
to
live
and
driven
to
hard
and
uncongenial
labors
forced
to
run
races
with
men
or
starve
to
such
my
remarks
do
not
apply
they
are
exceptions
and
not
the
rule
to
them
i
would
say
do
cheerfully
what
providence
seems
to
point
out
for
do
the
best
you
can
even
in
the
sphere
into
which
you
are
forced
if
you
are
at
any
time
thrown
upon
your
own
resources
and
compelled
to
adopt
callings
which
task
your
physical
strength
accept
such
lot
with
resignation
but
without
any
surrender
of
your
essentially
feminine
and
womanly
qualities
do
not
try
to
be
like
men
for
men
are
lower
than
you
in
their
ordinary
tastes
and
occupations
and
i
would
urge
all
women
rich
and
poor
to
pursue
some
one
art
like
music
or
painting
or
decoration
not
only
for
amusement
but
with
the
purpose
to
carry
it
so
far
that
in
case
of
misfortune
they
can
fall
back
upon
it
and
get
a
living
for
proficiency
in
these
arts
belongs
as
much
to
the
sphere
of
women
as
of
men
since
it
refines
and
cultivates
them
but
again
some
may
say
not
those
who
are
unfortunate
and
seemingly
driven
from
the
glories
and
beatitudes
of
woman
sphere
but
those
who
are
peculiarly
intellectual
and
aspiring
and
in
some
respects
very
interesting
why
should
not
we
embark
in
some
of
those
callings
which
heretofore
have
been
assigned
to
or
usurped
by
man
and
become
physicians
and
professors
in
colleges
and
lawyers
and
merchants
not
because
we
are
driven
to
get
a
living
but
because
we
prefer
them
and
hence
in
order
to
fit
ourselves
for
these
departments
why
should
we
not
pursue
the
highest
studies
which
task
the
intellect
of
man
to
such
i
would
reply
do
so
if
you
please
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
you
should
not
try
nor
will
you
fail
unless
your
frailer
bodies
fail
as
fail
they
will
in
a
long
race
for
do
what
you
will
to
strengthen
and
develop
your
physical
forces
for
a
million
of
years
you
will
still
be
women
and
physically
weaker
than
men
that
is
your
nervous
system
can
not
stand
the
strain
of
that
and
intense
application
which
all
professional
men
are
compelled
to
exert
in
order
to
gain
success
but
if
you
have
in
any
individual
case
the
physical
strength
of
a
man
do
what
you
please
so
long
as
you
preserve
the
delicacy
and
purity
of
womanhood
practise
medicine
or
law
keep
school
translate
books
keep
boarders
go
behind
a
counter
yea
keep
a
shop
set
types
keep
accounts
give
music
and
french
lessons
sing
in
concerts
and
churches
do
whatever
you
can
do
as
well
as
men
you
have
that
right
nobody
will
molest
you
or
slander
you
if
you
must
or
if
you
choose
to
labor
so
god
help
you
so
then
the
whole
question
of
woman
education
is
decided
by
physical
limitations
concerning
which
there
is
no
dispute
and
against
which
it
is
vain
to
rebel
and
we
return
to
the
more
agreeable
task
of
pointing
out
the
supreme
necessity
of
developing
in
woman
those
qualities
which
will
make
her
a
guide
and
a
radiance
and
a
benediction
in
that
sphere
to
which
nature
and
providence
and
immemorial
custom
would
appear
to
have
assigned
her
let
her
become
great
as
a
woman
not
as
a
man
let
her
maintain
her
rights
but
in
doing
so
let
her
not
forget
her
duties
the
bible
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
former
and
very
much
about
the
latter
let
her
remember
that
she
is
the
complement
of
a
man
and
hence
that
what
is
most
feminine
about
her
is
most
interesting
to
man
and
useful
to
the
world
god
made
man
and
woman
of
one
flesh
yet
unlike
and
who
can
point
out
any
fundamental
inferiority
or
superiority
between
them
the
only
superiority
lies
in
the
superior
way
in
which
each
discharges
peculiar
trusts
and
responsibilities
it
is
in
this
light
alone
that
we
see
some
husbands
superior
to
their
wives
and
some
wives
superior
to
their
husbands
no
sensible
person
would
say
that
a
girl
is
superior
to
her
brother
because
she
has
a
greater
aptness
for
mathematics
than
he
but
because
she
excels
in
the
attributes
and
virtues
and
duties
peculiar
to
her
own
sex
and
belonging
to
her
own
sphere
that
sphere
so
beautiful
that
when
she
abdicates
it
it
is
like
being
expelled
from
paradise
for
once
lost
it
can
never
be
regained
that
education
is
best
even
for
a
great
woman
great
in
intellect
as
in
soul
which
best
develops
the
lofty
ideal
of
womanhood
which
best
makes
her
a
real
woman
and
not
a
poor
imitation
of
man
and
gives
to
her
the
dignity
and
grace
of
a
queen
over
her
household
and
brings
out
that
moral
beauty
by
which
she
reigns
over
her
heart
and
inspires
the
reverence
which
children
ought
to
feel
do
we
derogate
from
the
greatness
of
women
when
we
seek
to
kindle
the
brightness
of
that
moral
beauty
which
outshines
all
the
triumphs
of
mere
intellectual
forces
should
women
murmur
because
they
can
not
be
superior
in
everything
when
it
is
conceded
that
they
are
superior
in
the
best
thing
nor
let
her
clutch
what
she
can
neither
retain
nor
enjoy
in
the
primeval
paradise
there
was
one
tree
the
fruit
of
which
our
mother
eve
was
forbidden
to
touch
or
to
eat
there
is
a
tree
which
grows
in
our
times
whose
fruit
when
eaten
by
some
produces
unrest
discontent
rebellion
against
god
unsatisfied
desires
a
revelation
of
unrealized
miseries
the
mere
contemplation
of
which
is
enough
to
drive
to
madness
and
moral
death
yet
of
all
the
other
trees
of
life
garden
may
woman
eat
those
trees
that
grow
in
the
boundless
field
which
modern
knowledge
and
enterprise
have
revealed
to
woman
and
which
if
she
confine
herself
thereto
will
make
her
a
blessing
and
a
glory

woman
as

since
the
dawn
of
modern
civilization
every
age
has
been
marked
by
some
new
development
of
genius
or
energy
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
we
notice
gothic
architecture
the
rise
of
universities
the
scholastic
philosophy
and
a
general
interest
in
metaphysical
inquiries
the
fourteenth
century
witnessed
chivalric
heroism
courts
of
love
tournaments
and
amorous
poetry
in
the
fifteenth
century
we
see
the
revival
of
classical
literature
and
grecian
art
the
sixteenth
century
was
a
period
of
reform
theological
discussions
and
warfare
with
romanism
in
the
seventeenth
century
came
contests
for
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
discussions
on
the
theological
questions
which
had
agitated
the
fathers
of
the
church
the
eighteenth
century
was
marked
by
the
speculations
of
philosophers
and
political
economists
ending
in
revolution
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
distinguished
for
scientific
discoveries
and
inventions
directed
to
practical
and
utilitarian
ends
and
a
wonderful
development
in
the
literature
of
fiction
it
is
the
age
of
novelists
as
the
fifteenth
century
was
the
age
of
painters
everybody
now
reads
novels
bishops
statesmen
judges
scholars
as
well
as
young
men
and
women
the
shelves
of
libraries
groan
with
the
weight
of
novels
of
every
description
novels
sensational
novels
sentimental
novels
historical
novels
philosophical
novels
social
and
novels
which
discuss
every
subject
under
the
sun
novelists
aim
to
be
teachers
in
ethics
philosophy
politics
religion
and
art
and
they
are
rapidly
supplanting
lecturers
and
clergymen
as
the
guides
of
men
accepting
no
rivals
but
editors
and
reviewers
this
extraordinary
literary
movement
was
started
by
sir
walter
scott
who
made
a
revolution
in
introducing
a
new
style
freeing
romances
from
bad
taste
vulgarity
insipidity
and
false
sentiment
he
painted
life
and
nature
without
exaggerations
avoided
interminable
scenes
of
and
gave
a
picture
of
society
in
present
and
past
times
so
fresh
so
vivid
so
natural
so
charming
and
so
true
and
all
with
such
inimitable
humor
that
he
still
reigns
without
a
peer
in
his
peculiar
domain
he
is
as
rich
in
humor
as
fielding
without
his
coarseness
as
inventive
as
swift
without
his
bitterness
as
moral
as
richardson
without
his
tediousness
he
did
not
aim
to
teach
ethics
or
political
economy
directly
although
he
did
not
disguise
his
opinions
his
chief
end
was
to
please
and
instruct
at
the
same
time
stimulating
the
mind
through
the
imagination
rather
than
the
reason
so
healthful
that
fastidious
parents
made
an
exception
of
his
novels
among
all
others
that
had
ever
been
written
and
encouraged
the
young
to
read
them
sir
walter
scott
took
off
the
ban
which
religious
people
had
imposed
on
then
came
dickens
amazingly
popular
with
his
grotesque
descriptions
of
life
his
exaggerations
his
impossible
characters
and
improbable
incidents
yet
so
genial
in
sympathies
so
rich
in
humor
so
indignant
at
wrongs
so
broad
in
his
humanity
that
everybody
loved
to
read
him
although
his
learning
was
small
and
his
culture
superficial
greatly
superior
to
him
as
an
artist
and
a
thinker
was
thackeray
whose
fame
has
been
steadily
increasing
the
greatest
master
of
satire
in
english
literature
and
one
of
the
truest
painters
of
social
life
that
any
age
has
produced
not
so
much
admired
by
women
as
by
men
accurate
in
his
delineation
of
character
though
sometimes
bitter
and
fierce
felicitous
in
plot
teaching
lessons
in
morality
unveiling
shams
and
hypocrisy
contemptuous
of
all
fools
and
quacks
yet
sad
in
his
reflections
on
human
life
in
the
brilliant
constellation
of
which
dickens
and
thackeray
were
the
greater
lights
was
bulwer
lytton
versatile
subjective
in
genius
sentimental
and
yet
not
sensational
reflective
yet
not
always
sound
in
morals
learned
in
general
literature
but
a
charlatan
in
scientific
knowledge
worldly
in
his
spirit
but
not
a
pagan
an
inquisitive
student
seeking
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
nature
as
well
as
to
paint
characters
and
events
in
other
times
and
leaving
a
higher
moral
impression
when
he
was
old
than
when
he
was
young
among
the
lesser
lights
yet
real
stars
that
have
blazed
in
this
generation
are
reade
kingsley
black
james
trollope
cooper
howells
wallace
and
a
multitude
of
others
in
france
and
germany
as
well
as
england
and
america
to
say
nothing
of
the
thousands
who
have
aspired
and
failed
as
artists
yet
who
have
succeeded
in
securing
readers
and
in
making
money
and
what
shall
i
say
of
the
host
of
female
novelists
which
this
age
has
produced
women
who
have
inundated
the
land
with
productions
both
good
and
bad
mostly
feeble
penetrating
the
cottages
of
the
poor
rather
than
the
palaces
of
the
rich
and
making
the
fortunes
of
magazines
and
from
maine
to
california
but
there
are
three
women
novelists
writing
in
english
standing
out
in
this
group
of
mediocrity
who
have
earned
a
just
and
wide
fame
charlotte
bronté
harriet
beecher
stowe
and
marian
evans
who
goes
by
the
name
of
george
eliot
it
is
the
last
of
these
remarkable
women
whom
it
is
my
object
to
discuss
and
who
burst
upon
the
literary
world
as
a
star
whose
light
has
been
constantly
increasing
since
she
first
appeared
she
takes
rank
with
dickens
thackeray
and
bulwer
and
some
place
her
higher
even
than
sir
walter
scott
her
fame
is
prodigious
and
it
is
a
glory
to
her
sex
indeed
she
is
an
intellectual
phenomenon
no
woman
ever
received
such
universal
fame
as
a
genius
except
perhaps
madame
de
staël
or
as
an
artist
if
we
except
madame
dudevant
who
also
bore
a
de
georges
sand
she
did
not
become
immediately
popular
but
the
critics
from
the
first
perceived
her
remarkable
gifts
and
predicted
her
ultimate
success
for
vivid
description
of
natural
scenery
and
rural
english
life
minute
analysis
of
character
and
psychological
insight
she
has
never
been
surpassed
by
men
while
for
learning
and
profundity
she
has
never
been
equalled
by
women
a
deep
serious
sad
writer
without
vanity
or
egotism
or
pretension
a
great
but
not
always
sound
teacher
who
by
common
consent
and
prediction
will
live
and
rank
among
the
classical
authors
in
english
literature
marian
evans
was
born
in
warwickshire
about
twenty
miles
from
the
county
of
shakspeare
one
of
the
most
fertile
and
beautiful
in
england
whose
parks
and
lawns
and
hedges
and
picturesque
cottages
with
their
gardens
and
flowers
and
thatched
roofs
present
to
the
eye
a
perpetual
charm
her
father
of
welsh
descent
was
originally
a
carpenter
but
became
by
his
sturdy
honesty
ability
and
abiding
sense
of
duty
land
agent
to
sir
roger
newdigate
of
arbury
hall
evans
sterling
character
probably
furnished
the
model
for
adam
bede
and
caleb
garth
sprung
from
humble
ranks
but
from
conscientious
and
religious
parents
who
appreciated
the
advantage
of
education
miss
evans
was
allowed
to
make
the
best
of
her
circumstances
we
have
few
details
of
her
early
life
on
which
we
can
accurately
rely
she
was
not
an
egotist
and
did
not
leave
an
autobiography
like
trollope
or
reminiscences
like
carlyle
but
she
has
probably
portrayed
herself
in
her
early
aspirations
as
madame
de
staël
did
in
the
characters
she
has
created
the
less
we
know
about
the
personalities
of
very
distinguished
geniuses
the
better
it
is
for
their
fame
shakspeare
might
not
seem
so
great
to
us
if
we
knew
his
peculiarities
and
infirmities
as
we
know
those
of
voltaire
rousseau
and
carlyle
only
such
a
downright
honest
and
good
man
as
johnson
can
stand
the
severe
scrutiny
of
after
times
and
destructive
criticism
it
would
appear
that
miss
evans
was
sent
to
a
school
in
nuneaton
before
she
was
ten
and
afterwards
to
a
school
in
coventry
kept
by
two
excellent
methodist
ladies
the
misses
franklin
whose
lives
and
teachings
enabled
her
to
delineate
dinah
morris
as
a
we
are
told
that
she
had
the
manners
and
appearance
of
a
woman
her
hair
was
pale
brown
worn
in
ringlets
her
figure
was
slight
her
head
massive
her
mouth
large
her
jaw
square
her
complexion
pale
her
eyes
and
her
voice
rich
and
musical
she
lost
her
mother
at
sixteen
when
she
most
needed
maternal
counsels
and
afterwards
lived
alone
with
her
father
until
when
they
removed
to
foleshill
near
coventry
she
was
educated
in
the
doctrines
of
the
low
or
evangelical
church
which
are
those
of
calvin
although
her
calvinism
was
early
modified
by
the
arminian
views
of
wesley
at
twelve
she
taught
a
class
in
a
at
twenty
she
wrote
poetry
as
most
bright
girls
do
the
of
the
grammar
school
in
coventry
taught
her
greek
and
latin
while
signor
brizzi
gave
her
lessons
in
italian
french
and
german
she
also
played
on
the
piano
with
great
skill
her
learning
and
accomplishments
were
so
unusual
and
gave
such
indication
of
talent
that
she
was
received
as
a
friend
in
the
house
of
charles
bray
of
coventry
a
wealthy
where
she
saw
many
eminent
literary
men
of
the
progressive
school
among
whom
were
james
anthony
froude
and
ralph
waldo
emerson
at
what
period
the
change
in
her
religious
views
took
place
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
probably
between
the
ages
of
and
by
which
time
she
had
become
a
remarkably
woman
of
great
conversational
powers
interesting
because
of
her
intelligence
brightness
and
sensibility
but
not
for
her
personal
beauty
in
fact
she
was
not
merely
homely
she
was
even
ugly
though
many
admirers
saw
great
beauty
in
her
eyes
and
expression
when
her
countenance
was
lighted
up
she
was
unobtrusive
and
modest
and
retired
within
herself
at
this
period
she
translated
from
the
german
the
life
of
jesus
by
strauss
feuerbach
essence
of
christianity
and
one
of
works
why
should
a
young
woman
have
selected
such
books
to
translate
how
far
the
writings
of
rationalistic
and
atheistic
philosophers
affected
her
own
views
we
can
not
tell
but
at
this
time
her
progressive
and
advanced
opinions
irritated
and
grieved
her
father
so
that
as
we
are
told
he
treated
her
with
intolerant
harshness
with
all
her
paganism
however
she
retained
the
sense
of
duty
and
was
devoted
in
her
attentions
to
her
father
until
he
died
in
she
then
travelled
on
the
continent
with
the
brays
seeing
most
of
the
countries
of
europe
and
studying
their
languages
manners
and
institutions
she
resided
longest
in
a
near
geneva
amid
scenes
renowned
by
the
labors
of
gibbon
voltaire
and
madame
de
staël
in
sight
of
the
alps
absorbed
in
the
theories
of
simon
and
proudhon
a
believer
in
the
necessary
progress
of
the
race
as
the
result
of
evolution
rather
than
of
revelation
or
revolution
miss
evans
returned
to
england
about
the
year
the
year
of
the
great
exhibition
and
soon
after
became
of
the
westminster
review
at
one
time
edited
by
john
stuart
mill
but
then
in
charge
of
john
chapman
the
proprietor
at
whose
house
in
the
strand
she
boarded
there
she
met
a
large
circle
of
literary
and
scientific
men
of
the
radical
school
those
who
looked
upon
themselves
as
the
more
advanced
thinkers
of
the
age
whose
aim
was
to
destroy
belief
in
supernaturalism
and
inspiration
among
whom
were
john
stuart
mill
francis
newman
herbert
spencer
james
anthony
froude
lewes
john
roebuck
and
harriet
martineau
dreary
theorists
mistrusted
and
disliked
equally
by
the
old
whigs
and
tories
and
evangelical
dissenters
clever
thinkers
and
learned
doubters
but
arrogant
discontented
and
defiant
it
was
then
that
the
friendly
attachment
between
miss
evans
and
lewes
began
which
ripened
into
love
and
ended
in
a
scandal
lewes
was
as
homely
as
wilkes
and
was
three
years
older
than
miss
evans
a
very
bright
witty
versatile
learned
and
accomplished
man
a
brilliant
talker
novelist
playwright
biographer
actor
essayist
and
historian
whose
life
of
goethe
is
still
the
acknowledged
authority
in
germany
itself
as
carlyle
frederic
the
great
is
also
regarded
but
his
fame
has
since
been
eclipsed
by
that
of
the
woman
he
pretended
to
call
his
wife
and
with
whom
his
legal
wife
being
still
alive
he
lived
in
open
defiance
of
the
seventh
commandment
and
the
social
customs
of
england
for
twenty
years
this
unfortunate
connection
which
saddened
the
whole
subsequent
life
of
miss
evans
and
tinged
all
her
writings
with
the
gall
of
her
soul
excluded
her
from
that
high
conventional
society
which
it
has
been
the
aim
of
most
ambitious
women
to
enter
but
this
exclusion
was
not
perhaps
so
great
an
annoyance
to
miss
evans
as
it
would
have
been
to
hannah
more
since
she
was
not
fitted
to
shine
in
general
society
especially
if
frivolous
and
preferred
to
talk
with
authors
artists
actors
and
musical
geniuses
rather
than
with
prejudiced
idle
patricians
who
had
such
attractions
for
addison
pope
mackintosh
and
other
lights
of
literature
who
unconsciously
encouraged
that
idolatry
of
rank
and
wealth
which
is
one
of
the
most
uninteresting
traits
of
the
english
nation
nor
would
those
fashionable
people
whom
the
world
calls
great
have
seen
much
to
attract
them
in
a
homely
and
unconventional
woman
whose
views
were
discrepant
with
the
established
social
and
religious
institutions
of
the
land
a
class
that
would
not
tolerate
such
a
genius
as
carlyle
would
not
have
admired
marian
evans
even
if
the
stern
etiquette
of
english
life
had
not
excluded
her
from
envied
and
coveted
and
she
herself
doubtless
preferred
to
them
the
brilliant
society
which
assembled
in
chapman
parlors
to
discuss
those
philosophical
and
political
theories
of
which
comte
was
regarded
as
the
and
his
positivism
the
essence
of
all
progressive
wisdom
how
far
the
gloomy
materialism
and
superficial
rationalism
of
lewes
may
have
affected
the
opinions
of
miss
evans
we
can
not
tell
he
was
her
teacher
and
constant
companion
and
she
passed
as
his
wife
so
it
is
probable
that
he
strengthened
in
her
mind
that
dreary
pessimism
which
appeared
in
her
later
writings
certain
it
is
that
she
paid
the
penalty
of
violating
a
fundamental
moral
law
in
the
neglect
of
those
women
whose
society
she
could
have
adorned
and
possibly
in
the
silent
reproaches
of
conscience
which
she
portrayed
so
vividly
in
the
characters
of
those
heroines
who
struggled
ineffectually
in
the
conflict
between
duty
and
passion
true
she
accepted
the
penalty
without
complaint
and
labored
to
the
end
of
her
days
with
masculine
strength
to
enforce
a
life
of
duty
and
on
her
readers
to
live
at
least
for
the
good
of
humanity
nor
did
she
court
notoriety
like
georges
sand
who
was
as
indifferent
to
reproach
as
she
was
to
shame
miss
evans
led
a
quiet
studious
unobtrusive
life
with
the
man
she
loved
sympathetic
in
her
intercourse
with
congenial
friends
and
devoted
to
domestic
duties
and
lewes
himself
relieved
her
from
many
irksome
details
that
she
might
be
free
to
prosecute
her
intense
literary
labors
in
this
lecture
on
george
eliot
i
gladly
would
have
omitted
all
allusion
to
a
mistake
which
impairs
our
respect
for
this
great
woman
but
defects
can
not
be
unnoticed
in
an
honest
delineation
of
character
and
no
candid
biographers
from
those
who
described
the
lives
of
abraham
and
david
to
those
who
have
portrayed
the
characters
of
queen
elizabeth
and
oliver
cromwell
have
sought
to
conceal
the
moral
defects
of
their
subjects
aside
from
the
translations
already
mentioned
the
first
literary
efforts
of
miss
evans
were
her
articles
in
the
westminster
review
a
heavy
quarterly
established
to
advocate
philosophical
radicalism
in
this
review
appeared
from
her
pen
the
article
on
carlyle
life
of
sterling
madame
de
la
sablière
evangelical
teachings
heine
silly
novels
by
lady
novelists
the
natural
history
of
german
life
worldliness
and
unworldliness
all
powerfully
written
but
with
a
vein
of
bitter
sarcasm
in
reference
to
the
teachers
of
those
doctrines
which
she
fancied
she
had
outgrown
her
connection
with
the
review
closed
in
when
she
left
chapman
home
and
retired
to
a
small
house
in
cambridge
terrace
hyde
park
on
a
modest
but
independent
income
in
she
revisited
the
continent
with
lewes
spending
her
time
chiefly
in
germany
it
was
in
that
the
first
tales
of
miss
evans
were
published
in
blackwood
magazine
when
she
was
in
the
full
maturity
of
her
mind
the
sad
fortunes
of
amos
barton
was
the
first
of
the
series
called
scenes
of
clerical
life
which
appeared
blackwood
saw
at
once
the
great
merit
of
the
work
and
although
it
was
not
calculated
to
arrest
the
attention
of
ordinary
readers
he
published
it
confident
of
its
ultimate
success
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
written
by
a
man
or
by
a
woman
he
only
knew
that
he
received
it
from
the
hand
of
lewes
an
author
already
well
known
as
learned
and
brilliant
it
is
fortunate
for
a
person
in
the
conventional
world
of
letters
as
of
society
to
be
well
introduced
this
story
though
gloomy
in
its
tone
is
fresh
unique
and
interesting
and
the
style
good
clear
vivid
strong
it
opens
with
a
beautiful
description
of
an
country
church
with
its
high
and
square
pews
in
which
the
devout
worshippers
could
not
be
seen
by
one
another
nor
even
by
the
parson
this
functionary
went
to
church
in
and
after
his
short
sermon
of
platitudes
dined
with
the
squire
and
spent
the
remaining
days
of
the
week
in
hunting
or
fishing
and
his
evenings
in
playing
cards
quietly
drinking
his
ale
and
smoking
his
pipe
but
the
hero
of
the
story
amos
barton
is
a
different
sort
of
man
from
his
worldly
and
easy
rector
he
is
a
churchman
and
yet
intensely
evangelical
and
devoted
to
his
humble
duties
on
a
salary
of
with
a
large
family
and
a
sick
wife
he
is
narrow
but
truly
religious
and
disinterested
the
scene
of
the
story
is
laid
in
a
retired
country
village
in
the
midland
counties
at
a
time
when
the
evangelical
movement
was
in
full
force
in
england
in
the
early
part
of
last
century
contemporaneous
with
the
religious
revivals
of
new
england
when
the
bucolic
villagers
had
little
to
talk
about
or
interest
them
before
railways
had
changed
the
face
of
the
country
or
the
people
had
been
aroused
to
political
discussions
and
reforms
the
sorrows
of
the
worthy
clergyman
centered
in
an
indiscreet
and
in
part
unwilling
hospitality
which
he
gave
to
an
artful
needy
pretentious
selfish
woman
but
beautiful
and
full
of
soft
flatteries
which
hospitality
provoked
scandal
and
caused
the
poor
man
to
be
driven
away
to
another
parish
the
tragic
element
of
the
story
however
centres
in
barton
who
is
an
angel
radiant
with
moral
beauty
affectionate
devoted
and
uncomplaining
who
dies
at
last
from
overwork
and
privations
and
the
cares
of
a
large
family
of
children
there
is
no
plot
in
this
story
but
its
charm
and
power
consist
in
a
vivid
description
of
common
life
minute
but
not
exaggerated
which
enlists
our
sympathy
with
suffering
and
misfortune
deeply
excites
our
interest
in
commonplace
people
living
out
their
weary
and
monotonous
existence
this
was
a
new
departure
in
fiction
a
novel
without
or
happy
marriages
or
thrilling
adventures
or
impossible
catastrophes
but
there
is
great
pathos
in
this
homely
tale
of
sorrow
with
no
attempts
at
philosophizing
no
digressions
no
wearisome
chapters
that
one
wishes
to
skip
but
all
spontaneous
natural
free
showing
reserved
power
the
precious
buds
of
promise
destined
to
bloom
in
subsequent
works
till
the
world
should
be
filled
with
the
aroma
of
its
author
genius
and
there
is
also
great
humor
in
this
clerical
tale
of
which
the
following
is
a
specimen
dear
said
patten
falling
back
in
her
chair
and
lifting
up
her
withered
hands
would
gilfil
say
if
he
was
worthy
to
know
the
changes
as
have
come
about
in
the
church
in
these
ten
years
i
understand
these
new
sort
of
doctrines
when
barton
comes
to
see
me
he
talks
about
my
sins
and
my
need
of
marcy
now
hackett
never
been
a
sinner
from
the
first
beginning
when
i
went
into
service
i
did
my
duty
to
my
employers
i
was
as
good
a
wife
as
any
in
the
country
never
aggravating
my
husband
the
used
to
say
that
my
cheeses
was
to
be
depended
upon
to
describe
clerical
life
was
doubtless
the
aim
which
miss
evans
had
in
view
in
this
and
the
two
other
tales
which
soon
followed
in
these
as
indeed
in
all
her
novels
the
clergy
largely
figure
she
seems
to
be
profoundly
acquainted
with
the
theological
views
of
the
different
sects
as
well
as
with
the
social
habits
of
the
different
ministers
so
far
as
we
can
detect
her
preference
it
is
for
the
broad
church
or
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
especially
those
who
were
half
squires
and
half
parsons
in
districts
where
conservative
opinions
prevailed
for
though
she
was
a
philosophical
radical
she
was
reverential
in
her
turn
of
mind
and
clung
to
poetical
and
consecrated
sentiments
always
laying
more
stress
on
woman
than
on
her
the
second
of
the
clerical
series
gilfil
love
story
is
not
so
well
told
nor
is
it
so
interesting
as
the
first
besides
being
more
after
the
fashion
of
ordinary
stories
we
miss
in
it
the
humor
of
good
patten
nor
are
we
drawn
to
the
parson
although
the
description
of
his
early
unfortunate
love
is
done
with
a
powerful
hand
the
story
throughout
is
sad
and
painful
the
last
of
the
series
janet
repentance
is
i
think
the
best
the
hero
is
again
a
clergyman
an
evangelical
whose
life
is
one
long
succession
of
protracted
martyrdoms
an
expiation
to
atone
for
the
desertion
of
a
girl
whom
he
had
loved
and
ruined
while
in
college
here
we
see
for
the
first
time
in
george
eliot
writings
that
inexorable
fate
which
pursues
and
which
so
prominently
stands
out
in
all
her
novels
the
singular
thing
is
that
she
at
this
time
an
advanced
liberal
should
have
made
the
sinning
young
man
in
the
depth
of
his
remorse
to
find
relief
in
that
view
of
christianity
which
is
expounded
by
the
calvinists
but
here
she
is
faithful
and
true
to
the
teaching
of
those
by
whom
she
was
educated
and
it
is
remarkable
that
her
art
enables
her
apparently
to
enter
into
the
spiritual
experiences
of
an
evangelical
curate
with
which
she
had
no
sympathy
she
does
not
mock
or
deride
but
seems
to
respect
the
religion
which
she
had
herself
repudiated
and
the
same
truths
which
consoled
the
curate
are
also
made
to
redeem
janet
herself
and
secure
for
her
a
true
repentance
this
heroine
of
the
story
is
the
wife
of
a
drunken
brutal
village
doctor
who
dies
of
delirium
tremens
she
also
is
the
slave
of
the
same
degrading
habit
which
destroys
her
husband
but
unlike
him
is
a
victim
of
remorse
and
shame
in
her
despair
she
seeks
advice
and
consolation
from
the
minister
whom
she
had
ridiculed
and
despised
and
through
him
she
is
led
to
seek
that
divine
aid
which
alone
enables
a
confirmed
drunkard
to
conquer
what
by
mere
force
of
will
is
an
unconquerable
habit
and
here
george
eliot
for
that
is
the
name
she
now
goes
by
is
in
accord
with
the
profound
experience
of
many
the
whole
tale
though
short
is
a
triumph
of
art
and
abounds
with
acute
observations
of
human
nature
it
is
a
perfect
picture
of
village
life
with
its
gossip
its
jealousies
its
enmities
and
its
religious
quarrels
showing
on
the
part
of
the
author
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
theological
controversies
and
the
religious
movements
of
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
so
vivid
is
her
description
of
rural
life
that
the
tale
is
really
an
historical
painting
like
the
dutch
pictures
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
be
valued
as
an
accurate
delineation
rather
than
a
mere
imaginary
scene
madonnas
saints
and
such
like
pictures
which
fill
the
churches
of
italy
and
spain
works
of
the
old
masters
are
now
chiefly
prized
for
their
grace
of
form
and
richness
of
coloring
exhibitions
of
ideal
beauty
charming
as
creations
but
not
such
as
we
see
in
real
life
george
eliot
novels
on
the
contrary
are
not
works
of
imagination
like
the
frescos
in
the
sistine
chapel
but
copies
of
real
life
like
those
of
wilkie
and
teniers
which
we
value
for
their
fidelity
to
nature
and
in
regard
to
the
passion
of
love
she
does
not
portray
it
as
in
the
novels
leading
to
fortunate
marriages
with
squires
and
baronets
but
she
generally
dissects
it
unravels
it
and
attempts
to
penetrate
its
mysteries
a
work
decidedly
more
psychological
than
romantic
or
sentimental
and
hence
more
interesting
to
scholars
and
thinkers
than
to
ordinary
readers
who
delight
in
thrilling
adventures
and
exciting
narrations
the
scenes
of
clerical
life
were
followed
the
next
year
by
adam
bede
which
created
a
great
impression
on
the
cultivated
mind
of
england
and
america
it
did
not
create
what
is
called
a
sensation
i
doubt
if
it
was
even
popular
with
the
generality
of
readers
nor
was
the
sale
rapid
at
first
but
the
critics
saw
that
a
new
star
of
extraordinary
brilliancy
had
arisen
in
the
literary
horizon
the
unknown
author
entered
as
she
did
in
janet
repentance
an
entirely
new
field
with
wonderful
insight
into
the
common
life
of
uninteresting
people
with
a
peculiar
humor
great
power
of
description
rare
felicity
of
dialogue
and
a
deep
undertone
of
serious
and
earnest
reflection
and
yet
i
confess
that
when
i
first
read
adam
bede
years
ago
i
was
not
much
interested
and
i
wondered
why
others
were
it
was
not
dramatic
enough
to
excite
me
many
parts
of
it
were
tedious
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
too
much
spun
out
and
its
minuteness
of
detail
wearied
me
there
was
no
great
plot
and
no
grand
characters
nothing
heroic
no
rapidity
of
movement
nothing
to
keep
me
from
laying
the
book
down
when
the
rang
or
when
the
time
came
to
go
to
bed
i
did
not
then
see
the
great
artistic
excellence
of
the
book
and
i
did
not
care
for
a
description
of
obscure
people
in
the
midland
counties
of
england
which
by
the
way
suggests
a
reason
why
adam
bede
can
not
be
appreciated
by
americans
as
it
is
by
the
english
people
themselves
who
every
day
see
the
characters
described
and
hear
their
dialect
and
know
their
sorrows
and
sympathize
with
their
privations
and
labors
but
after
a
closer
and
more
critical
study
of
the
novel
i
have
come
to
see
merits
that
before
escaped
my
eye
it
is
a
study
a
picture
of
humble
english
life
painted
by
the
hand
of
a
master
to
be
enjoyed
most
by
people
of
critical
discernment
and
to
be
valued
for
its
rare
fidelity
to
nature
it
is
of
more
true
historical
interest
than
many
novels
which
are
called
historical
even
as
the
paintings
of
rembrandt
are
more
truly
historical
than
those
of
horace
vernet
since
the
former
painted
life
as
it
really
was
in
his
day
imaginative
pictures
are
not
those
which
are
most
prized
by
modern
artists
or
those
pictures
which
make
every
woman
look
like
an
angel
and
every
man
like
a
hero
like
those
of
gainsborough
or
reynolds
however
flattering
they
may
be
to
those
who
pay
for
them
i
need
not
dwell
on
characters
so
well
known
as
those
painted
in
adam
bede
the
hero
is
a
painstaking
faithful
journeyman
carpenter
desirous
of
doing
good
work
scotland
and
england
abound
in
such
men
and
so
did
new
england
fifty
years
ago
this
honest
mechanic
falls
in
love
with
a
pretty
but
vain
empty
silly
selfish
girl
of
his
own
class
but
she
had
already
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
young
squire
of
the
village
a
fellow
of
generous
impulses
but
essentially
selfish
and
thoughtless
and
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
his
duty
the
carpenter
when
he
finds
it
out
gives
vent
to
his
wrath
and
jealousy
as
is
natural
and
picks
a
quarrel
with
the
squire
and
knocks
him
down
an
act
of
violence
on
the
part
of
the
inferior
in
rank
not
very
common
in
england
the
squire
abandons
his
victim
after
ruining
her
character
not
an
uncommon
thing
among
young
aristocrats
and
the
girl
strangely
accepts
the
renewed
attentions
of
her
first
lover
until
the
logic
of
events
compels
her
to
run
away
from
home
and
become
a
vagrant
the
tragic
and
interesting
part
of
the
novel
is
a
vivid
painting
of
the
terrible
sufferings
of
the
ruined
girl
in
her
desolate
wanderings
and
of
her
trial
for
abandoning
her
infant
child
to
death
the
inexorable
law
of
fate
driving
the
sinner
into
the
realms
of
darkness
and
shame
the
story
closes
with
the
prosaic
marriage
of
adam
bede
to
dinah
morris
a
methodist
preacher
who
falls
in
love
with
him
instead
of
his
more
pious
brother
seth
who
adores
her
but
the
love
of
adam
and
dinah
for
one
another
is
more
spiritualized
than
is
common
is
very
beautiful
indeed
showing
how
love
divine
elements
can
animate
the
human
soul
in
all
conditions
of
life
in
the
fervid
spiritualism
of
dinah
love
for
adam
we
are
reminded
of
a
saint
theresa
seeking
to
be
united
with
her
divine
spouse
dinah
is
a
religious
rhapsodist
seeking
wisdom
and
guidance
in
prayer
and
the
divine
will
is
in
accordance
with
her
desires
my
soul
said
she
to
adam
is
so
knit
to
yours
that
it
is
but
a
divided
life
if
i
live
without
you
the
most
amusing
and
character
in
this
novel
is
a
secondary
one
poyser
but
painted
with
a
vividness
which
scott
never
excelled
and
with
a
wealth
of
humor
which
fielding
never
equalled
it
is
the
wit
and
humor
which
george
eliot
has
presented
in
this
inimitable
character
which
make
the
book
so
attractive
to
the
english
who
enjoy
these
more
than
the
americans
the
latter
delighting
rather
in
what
is
grotesque
and
extravagant
like
the
elaborate
absurdities
of
mark
twain
but
this
humor
is
more
than
that
of
a
shrewd
and
thrifty
english
farmer
wife
it
belongs
to
human
nature
we
have
seen
such
voluble
sharp
sagacious
ironical
and
worldly
women
among
the
of
new
england
and
heard
them
use
language
when
excited
or
indignant
equally
idiomatic
though
not
particularly
choice
strike
out
the
humor
of
this
novel
and
the
interest
we
are
made
to
feel
in
commonplace
people
and
the
story
would
not
be
a
remarkable
one
adam
bede
was
followed
in
a
year
by
the
mill
on
the
floss
the
scene
of
which
is
also
laid
in
a
country
village
where
are
some
people
mostly
vulgar
and
uninteresting
this
novel
is
to
me
more
powerful
than
the
one
which
preceded
it
having
more
faults
perhaps
but
presenting
more
striking
characters
as
usual
with
george
eliot
her
plot
in
this
story
is
poor
involving
improbable
incidents
and
catastrophes
she
is
always
unfortunate
in
her
attempts
to
extricate
her
heroes
and
heroines
from
entangling
difficulties
invention
is
not
her
forte
she
is
weak
when
she
departs
from
realistic
figures
she
is
strongest
in
what
she
has
seen
not
in
what
she
imagines
and
here
she
is
the
opposite
of
dickens
who
paints
from
imagination
there
was
never
such
a
man
as
pickwick
or
barnaby
rudge
sir
walter
scott
created
characters
like
jeannie
deans
but
they
are
as
true
to
life
as
sir
john
falstaff
maggie
tulliver
is
the
heroine
of
this
story
in
whose
intellectual
developments
george
eliot
painted
herself
as
madame
de
staël
describes
her
own
restless
in
delphine
and
corinne
nothing
in
fiction
is
more
natural
and
than
the
of
maggie
when
she
goes
fishing
with
her
tyrannical
brother
and
when
the
two
children
quarrel
and
make
up
she
affectionate
and
yielding
he
fitful
and
overbearing
many
girls
are
tyrannized
over
by
their
brothers
who
are
often
exacting
claiming
the
guardianship
which
belongs
only
to
parents
but
maggie
yields
to
her
obstinate
brother
as
well
as
to
her
unreasonable
and
vindictive
father
governed
by
a
sense
of
duty
until
with
her
rapid
intellectual
development
and
lofty
aspiration
she
breaks
loose
in
a
measure
from
their
withering
influence
though
not
from
technical
obligations
she
almost
loves
philip
wakem
the
son
of
the
lawyer
who
ruined
her
father
yet
out
of
regard
to
family
ties
she
refuses
while
she
does
not
yet
repel
his
love
but
her
real
passion
is
for
stephen
gurst
who
was
betrothed
to
her
cousin
and
who
returned
maggie
love
with
intense
fervor
why
did
he
love
her
curious
fools
be
still
is
human
love
the
fruit
of
human
will
she
knows
she
ought
not
to
love
this
man
yet
she
combats
her
passion
with
poor
success
allows
herself
to
be
compromised
in
her
relations
with
him
and
is
only
rescued
by
a
supreme
effort
of
a
principle
which
runs
through
all
george
novels
in
which
we
see
the
doctrines
of
buddha
rather
than
those
of
paul
although
at
times
they
seem
to
run
into
each
other
maggie
erred
in
not
closing
the
gate
of
her
heart
inexorably
and
in
not
resisting
the
sway
of
a
purely
physiological
law
the
vivid
description
of
this
sort
of
love
with
its
strange
agitations
and
agonizing
ecstasies
would
have
been
denounced
as
immoral
fifty
years
ago
the
is
an
improbable
catastrophe
on
a
tidal
river
in
the
rising
floods
of
which
maggie
and
her
brother
are
drowned
a
favorite
way
with
the
author
in
disposing
of
her
heroes
and
heroines
when
she
can
no
longer
manage
them
the
secondary
characters
of
this
novel
are
numerous
varied
and
natural
and
described
with
great
felicity
and
humor
none
of
them
are
interesting
people
in
fact
most
of
them
are
very
uninteresting
vulgar
material
selfish
such
as
are
seen
among
those
to
whom
money
and
worldly
prosperity
are
everything
with
no
perception
of
what
is
lofty
and
disinterested
and
on
whom
grand
sentiments
are
lost
yet
in
the
main
and
in
the
case
of
the
dobsons
redeemed
by
a
sort
of
family
pride
the
moral
of
the
story
is
the
usual
one
with
george
eliot
the
conflict
of
duty
with
passion
and
the
inexorable
fate
which
pursues
the
sinner
she
brings
out
the
power
of
conscience
as
forcibly
as
hawthorne
has
done
in
his
scarlet
letter
the
mill
on
the
floss
was
soon
followed
by
silas
marner
regarded
by
some
as
the
gem
of
george
eliot
novels
and
which
certainly
though
pathetic
and
sad
as
all
her
novels
are
does
not
leave
on
the
mind
so
mournful
an
impression
since
in
its
outcome
we
see
redemption
the
principal
character
the
poor
neglected
forlorn
weaver
emerges
at
length
from
the
everlasting
nay
into
the
everlasting
yea
and
he
emerges
by
the
power
of
love
love
for
a
little
child
whom
he
has
rescued
from
the
snow
the
storm
and
death
driven
by
injustice
to
a
solitary
life
to
abject
penury
to
despair
the
solitary
miser
gloating
over
his
gold
pieces
which
he
has
saved
by
the
hardest
privation
and
in
which
he
trusts
finds
himself
robbed
without
redress
or
sympathy
but
in
the
end
he
is
consoled
for
his
loss
in
the
love
he
bestows
on
a
helpless
orphan
who
returns
it
with
the
most
noble
disinterestedness
and
lives
to
be
his
solace
and
his
pride
nothing
more
touching
has
ever
been
written
by
man
or
woman
than
this
short
story
as
full
of
pathos
as
adam
bede
is
full
of
humor
what
is
remarkable
in
this
story
is
that
the
plot
is
exactly
similar
to
that
of
jermola
the
potter
the
masterpiece
of
a
famous
polish
novelist
a
marvellous
coincidence
or
plagiarism
difficult
to
be
explained
but
shakspeare
the
most
original
of
men
borrowed
some
of
his
plots
from
italian
writers
and
mirabeau
appropriated
the
knowledge
of
men
more
learned
than
he
which
by
felicity
of
genius
he
made
his
own
and
webster
too
did
the
same
thing
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
except
in
the
way
of
putting
things
after
the
publication
of
the
various
novels
pertaining
to
the
rural
and
humble
life
of
england
with
which
george
eliot
was
so
well
acquainted
into
which
she
entered
with
so
much
sympathy
and
which
she
so
marvellously
portrayed
she
took
a
new
departure
entering
a
field
with
which
she
was
not
so
well
acquainted
and
of
which
she
could
only
learn
through
books
the
result
was
romola
the
most
ambitious
and
in
some
respects
the
most
remarkable
of
all
her
works
it
certainly
is
the
most
learned
and
elaborate
it
is
a
novel
the
scene
of
which
is
laid
in
florence
at
the
time
of
savonarola
the
period
called
the
renaissance
when
art
and
literature
were
revived
with
great
enthusiasm
a
very
interesting
period
the
glorious
morning
as
it
were
of
modern
civilization
this
novel
the
result
of
reading
and
reflection
necessarily
called
into
exercise
other
faculties
besides
accurate
observation
even
imagination
and
invention
for
which
she
is
not
distinguished
in
this
novel
though
interesting
and
instructive
we
miss
the
humor
and
simplicity
of
the
earlier
works
it
is
overloaded
with
learning
not
one
intelligent
reader
in
a
hundred
has
ever
heard
even
the
names
of
many
of
the
eminent
men
to
whom
she
alludes
it
is
full
of
digressions
and
of
reflections
on
scientific
theories
many
of
the
chapters
are
dry
and
pedantic
it
is
too
philosophical
to
be
popular
too
learned
to
be
appreciated
as
in
some
of
her
other
stories
highly
improbable
events
take
place
the
plot
is
not
felicitous
and
the
ending
is
unsatisfactory
the
italian
critics
of
the
book
are
not
on
the
whole
complimentary
george
eliot
essayed
to
do
with
prodigious
labor
what
she
had
no
special
aptitude
for
carlyle
in
ten
sentences
would
have
made
a
more
graphic
picture
of
savonarola
none
of
her
historical
characters
stand
out
with
the
vividness
with
which
scott
represented
queen
elizabeth
and
mary
queen
of
scots
or
with
which
even
bulwer
painted
rienzi
and
the
last
of
the
barons
critics
do
not
admire
historical
novels
because
they
are
neither
history
nor
fiction
they
mislead
readers
on
important
issues
and
they
are
not
so
interesting
as
the
masterpieces
of
macaulay
and
froude
yet
they
have
their
uses
they
give
a
superficial
knowledge
of
great
characters
to
those
who
will
not
read
history
the
field
of
history
is
too
vast
for
ordinary
people
who
have
no
time
for
extensive
reading
even
if
they
have
the
inclination
the
great
historical
personage
whom
george
eliot
paints
in
romola
is
savonarola
and
i
think
faithfully
on
the
whole
in
the
main
she
coincides
with
villani
the
greatest
authority
in
some
respects
i
should
take
issue
with
her
she
makes
the
religion
of
the
florentine
reformer
to
harmonize
with
her
notions
of
she
makes
him
preach
the
religion
of
humanity
which
was
certainly
not
taught
in
his
day
he
preached
duty
indeed
and
appealed
to
conscience
but
he
preached
duty
to
god
rather
than
to
man
the
majesty
of
a
personal
god
fearful
in
judgment
and
as
represented
by
the
old
jewish
prophets
was
the
great
idea
of
savonarola
theology
his
formula
was
something
like
this
punishment
for
sin
is
a
divine
judgment
not
the
effect
of
inexorable
laws
repentance
is
a
necessity
unless
men
repent
of
their
sins
god
will
punish
them
unless
italy
repents
it
will
be
desolated
by
his
vengeance
catholic
theology
which
he
never
departed
from
has
ever
recognized
the
supreme
allegiance
of
man
to
his
maker
because
demands
it
even
among
the
jesuits
with
their
corrupted
theology
the
motto
emblazoned
on
their
standard
was
majorem
dei
but
the
great
dominican
preacher
is
made
by
george
eliot
to
be
the
spokesman
of
humanity
made
divine
not
of
deity
made
human
make
your
marriage
vows
said
he
to
romola
an
offering
to
the
great
work
by
which
sin
and
sorrow
are
made
to
cease
but
savonarola
is
only
a
secondary
character
in
the
novel
he
might
as
well
have
been
left
out
altogether
the
real
hero
and
heroine
are
romola
and
tito
and
they
are
identified
with
the
life
of
the
period
which
is
the
renaissance
a
movement
more
pagan
than
christian
these
two
characters
may
be
called
creations
romola
is
an
italian
woman
supposed
to
represent
a
learned
and
noble
lady
four
hundred
years
ago
she
has
lofty
purposes
and
aspirations
she
is
imbued
with
the
philosophy
of
her
life
is
devoted
to
others
first
to
her
father
and
then
to
humanity
but
she
is
as
cold
as
marble
she
is
the
very
reverse
of
corinne
even
her
love
for
tito
is
made
to
vanish
away
on
the
first
detection
of
his
insincerity
although
he
is
her
husband
she
becomes
as
hard
and
implacable
as
fate
and
when
she
ceases
to
love
her
husband
she
hates
him
and
leaves
him
and
is
only
brought
back
by
a
sense
of
duty
yet
her
hatred
is
incurable
and
in
her
wretched
disappointment
she
finds
consolation
only
in
a
sort
of
stoicism
how
far
george
eliot
notions
of
immortality
are
brought
out
in
the
spiritual
experiences
of
romola
i
do
not
know
but
the
immortality
of
romola
is
not
that
which
is
brought
to
light
by
the
gospel
it
is
a
vague
and
indefinite
sentiment
kindred
to
that
of
indian
sages
that
we
live
hereafter
only
in
our
teachings
or
deeds
that
we
are
absorbed
in
the
universal
whole
that
our
immortality
is
the
living
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
men
not
personally
hereafter
among
the
redeemed
to
quote
her
own
fine
thought
oh
may
i
join
the
choir
invisible
in
pulses
stirred
to
generosity
in
deeds
of
daring
rectitude
in
scorn
for
miserable
aims
that
end
in
self
in
thoughts
sublime
that
pierce
the
night
like
stars
and
with
their
mild
persistence
urge
man
search
to
vaster
issues
tito
is
a
more
natural
character
with
generous
impulses
he
is
interesting
in
spite
of
his
faults
he
is
accomplished
versatile
and
brilliant
but
he
is
inherently
selfish
and
has
no
moral
courage
he
gradually
in
his
egotism
becomes
utterly
false
and
treacherous
though
not
an
ordinary
villain
he
is
the
creature
of
circumstances
his
weakness
leads
to
falsehood
and
falsehood
ends
in
crime
which
crime
pursues
him
with
unrelenting
vengeance
not
the
agonies
of
remorse
for
he
has
no
conscience
but
the
vindictive
and
persevering
hatred
of
his
foster
father
whom
he
robbed
the
vengeance
of
baldassare
is
almost
preternatural
it
surpasses
the
wrath
of
achilles
and
the
malignity
of
shylock
it
is
the
wrath
of
a
demon
from
which
there
is
no
escape
it
would
be
tragical
if
the
subject
of
it
were
greater
though
tito
perishes
in
an
improbable
way
he
is
yet
the
victim
of
the
inexorable
law
of
human
souls
but
if
romola
has
faults
it
has
remarkable
excellences
in
this
book
george
eliot
aspires
to
be
a
teacher
of
ethics
and
philosophy
she
is
not
humorous
but
intensely
serious
and
thoughtful
she
sometimes
discourses
like
epictetus
and
so
my
lillo
says
she
at
the
conclusion
if
you
mean
to
act
nobly
and
seek
to
know
the
best
things
god
has
put
within
reach
of
man
you
must
learn
to
fix
your
mind
on
that
end
and
not
on
what
will
happen
to
you
because
of
it
and
remember
if
you
were
to
choose
something
lower
and
make
it
the
rule
of
your
life
to
seek
your
own
pleasure
and
escape
what
is
disagreeable
calamity
might
come
just
the
same
and
it
would
be
a
calamity
falling
on
a
base
mind
which
is
the
one
form
of
sorrow
that
has
no
balm
in
it
and
that
may
well
make
a
man
say
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
i
had
never
been
born
three
years
elapsed
between
the
publication
of
romola
and
that
of
felix
holt
which
shows
to
what
a
strain
the
mind
of
george
eliot
had
been
subjected
in
elaborating
an
historical
novel
she
now
returns
to
her
own
peculiar
field
in
which
her
great
successes
had
been
made
and
with
which
she
was
familiar
and
yet
even
in
her
own
field
we
miss
now
the
genial
humanity
and
inimitable
humor
of
her
earlier
novels
in
felix
holt
she
deals
with
social
and
political
problems
in
regard
to
which
there
is
great
difference
of
opinion
for
the
difficult
questions
of
political
economy
have
not
yet
been
solved
felix
holt
is
a
political
economist
but
not
a
vulgar
radical
filled
with
discontent
and
envy
he
is
a
mechanic
tolerably
educated
and
able
to
converse
with
intelligence
on
the
projected
reforms
of
the
day
in
cultivated
language
he
is
and
conscientious
but
unpractical
and
gets
himself
into
difficulties
escaping
penal
servitude
almost
by
miracle
for
the
crime
of
homicide
the
heroine
esther
lyon
is
supposed
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
dissenting
minister
who
talks
theology
after
the
fashion
of
the
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
unknown
to
herself
however
she
is
really
the
daughter
of
the
heir
of
large
estates
and
ultimately
becomes
acknowledged
as
such
but
gives
up
wealth
and
social
position
to
marry
felix
holt
who
had
made
a
vow
of
perpetual
poverty
such
a
is
not
common
in
england
even
a
paula
would
hardly
have
accepted
such
a
lot
only
one
inspired
with
the
philosophy
of
marcus
aurelius
would
be
capable
of
such
a
willing
sacrifice
very
noble
but
very
improbable
the
most
powerful
part
of
the
story
is
the
description
of
the
remorse
which
so
often
accompanies
an
illicit
love
as
painted
in
the
proud
stately
stern
unbending
aristocratic
transome
though
youth
has
faded
and
joy
is
dead
and
love
has
turned
to
loathing
yet
memory
like
a
relentless
fury
pursues
the
woman
who
hides
within
her
breast
a
heavy
load
of
shame
and
dread
illicit
love
is
a
common
subject
with
george
eliot
and
it
is
always
represented
as
a
mistake
or
crime
followed
by
a
terrible
retribution
sooner
or
later
if
not
outwardly
at
least
inwardly
in
the
sorrows
of
a
wounded
and
soul
no
one
of
george
eliot
novels
opens
more
beautifully
than
felix
holt
though
there
is
the
usual
disappointment
of
readers
with
the
close
and
probably
no
description
of
a
rural
district
in
the
midland
counties
fifty
years
ago
has
ever
been
painted
which
equals
in
graphic
power
the
opening
chapter
the
old
coach
turnpike
the
roadside
inns
brilliant
with
polished
tankards
the
pretty
the
repartees
of
jocose
hostlers
the
announced
by
the
many
blasts
of
the
bugle
the
green
willows
of
the
the
patient
the
cows
the
rich
pastures
the
picturesque
milkmaids
the
shepherd
with
his
slouching
walk
the
laborer
with
his
bread
and
bacon
the
tidy
the
golden
the
bushy
hedgerows
bright
with
the
blossoms
of
the
wild
convolvulus
the
comfortable
parsonage
the
old
parish
church
with
its
towers
the
thatched
cottage
with
double
daisies
and
geraniums
in
the
these
and
other
details
bring
before
our
minds
a
rural
glory
which
has
passed
away
before
the
power
of
steam
and
may
never
again
return
felix
holt
was
published
in
and
it
was
five
years
before
middlemarch
appeared
a
very
long
novel
thought
by
some
to
be
the
best
which
george
eliot
has
written
read
fifteen
times
it
is
said
by
the
prince
of
wales
in
this
novel
the
author
seems
to
have
been
ambitious
to
sustain
her
fame
she
did
not
like
trollope
dash
off
three
novels
a
year
and
all
alike
she
did
not
write
mechanically
as
a
person
grinds
at
a
mill
nor
was
she
greedy
of
money
to
be
spent
in
running
races
with
the
rich
she
was
a
conscientious
writer
from
first
to
last
yet
middlemarch
with
all
the
labor
spent
upon
it
has
more
faults
than
any
of
her
preceding
novels
it
is
as
long
as
the
history
of
sir
charles
grandison
it
has
a
miserable
plot
it
has
many
tedious
chapters
and
too
many
figures
and
too
much
theorizing
on
social
science
rather
than
a
story
it
is
a
panorama
of
the
doctors
and
clergymen
and
lawyers
and
business
people
who
live
in
a
provincial
town
with
their
various
prejudices
and
passions
and
avocations
it
is
not
a
cheerful
picture
of
human
life
we
are
brought
to
see
an
unusual
number
of
misers
harpies
quacks
cheats
and
hypocrites
there
are
but
few
interesting
characters
in
it
dorothea
is
the
most
so
a
very
noble
woman
but
romantic
and
making
great
mistakes
she
desires
to
make
herself
useful
to
somebody
and
marries
a
narrow
jealous
aristocratic
pedant
who
had
spent
his
life
in
elaborate
studies
on
a
dry
and
worthless
subject
of
course
she
awakes
from
her
delusion
when
she
discovers
what
a
small
man
with
great
pretensions
her
learned
husband
is
but
she
remains
in
her
dreariness
of
soul
a
generous
virtuous
and
dutiful
woman
she
does
not
desert
her
husband
because
she
does
not
love
him
or
because
he
is
uncongenial
but
continues
faithful
to
the
end
like
maggie
tulliver
and
romola
she
has
lofty
aspirations
but
marries
after
her
husband
death
a
versatile
brilliant
shallow
bohemian
as
for
her
serious
nature
as
the
dreary
casaubon
himself
nor
are
we
brought
in
sympathy
with
lydgate
the
fashionable
doctor
with
grand
aims
since
he
allows
his
whole
scientific
aspirations
to
be
defeated
by
a
selfish
and
extravagant
wife
rosamond
vincy
is
however
one
of
the
best
drawn
characters
in
fiction
such
as
we
often
see
pretty
accomplished
clever
but
incapable
of
making
a
sacrifice
secretly
thwarting
her
husband
full
of
wretched
complaints
utterly
insincere
attractive
perhaps
to
men
but
despised
by
women
caleb
garth
is
a
second
adam
bede
and
cadwallader
the
aristocratic
wife
of
the
rector
is
a
second
poyser
in
the
glibness
of
her
tongue
and
in
the
thriftiness
of
her
ways
bullstrode
the
rich
banker
is
a
character
we
unfortunately
sometimes
find
in
a
large
country
town
a
man
of
varied
charities
a
pillar
of
the
church
but
as
full
of
cant
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
in
fact
a
hypocrite
and
a
villain
ultimately
exposed
and
punished
the
general
impression
left
on
the
mind
from
reading
middlemarch
is
sad
and
discouraging
in
it
is
brought
out
the
blended
stoicism
humanitarianism
buddhism
and
agnosticism
of
the
author
she
paints
the
struggle
of
noble
natures
struggling
vainly
against
the
currents
of
a
poor
kind
of
world
without
trust
in
an
invisible
rock
higher
than
themselves
to
which
they
could
entreat
to
be
lifted
up
in
another
five
years
george
eliot
produced
daniel
deronda
the
last
and
most
unsatisfactory
of
her
great
novels
written
in
feeble
health
and
with
exhausted
nervous
energies
as
she
was
passing
through
the
shadows
of
the
evening
of
her
life
in
this
work
she
doubtless
essayed
to
do
her
best
but
she
could
not
always
surpass
herself
any
more
than
could
scott
or
dickens
nor
is
she
to
be
judged
by
those
productions
which
reveal
her
failing
strength
but
by
those
which
were
written
in
the
fresh
enthusiasm
of
a
lofty
soul
no
one
thinks
the
less
of
milton
because
the
paradise
regained
is
not
equal
to
the
paradise
lost
many
are
the
immortal
poets
who
are
now
known
only
for
two
or
three
of
their
minor
poems
it
takes
a
michael
angelo
to
paint
his
grandest
frescos
after
reaching
eighty
years
of
age
or
a
gladstone
to
make
his
best
speeches
when
past
the
age
of
seventy
only
people
with
a
wonderful
physique
and
unwasted
mental
forces
can
go
on
from
conquering
to
conquer
people
moreover
who
have
reserved
their
strength
and
lived
temperate
and
active
lives
although
daniel
deronda
is
occasionally
brilliant
and
laboriously
elaborated
still
it
is
regarded
generally
by
the
critics
as
a
failure
the
long
digression
on
the
jews
is
not
artistic
and
the
subject
itself
is
uninteresting
especially
to
the
english
who
have
inveterate
prejudices
against
the
chosen
people
the
hebrews
as
they
choose
to
call
themselves
are
doubtless
a
remarkable
people
and
have
marvellously
preserved
their
traditions
and
their
customs
some
among
them
have
arisen
to
the
foremost
rank
in
scholarship
statesmanship
and
finance
they
have
entered
at
different
times
most
of
the
cabinets
of
europe
and
have
held
important
chairs
in
its
greatest
universities
but
it
was
a
utopian
dream
that
sent
daniel
deronda
to
the
orient
to
collect
together
the
scattered
members
of
his
race
nor
are
enthusiasts
and
proselytes
often
found
among
the
jews
we
see
talent
but
not
visionary
dreamers
to
the
english
they
appear
as
peculiarly
practical
bent
on
making
money
sensual
in
their
pleasures
and
only
distinguished
from
the
people
around
them
by
an
extravagant
love
of
jewelry
and
a
proud
and
cynical
rationalism
yet
in
justice
it
must
be
confessed
that
some
of
the
most
interesting
people
in
the
world
are
jews
in
daniel
deronda
the
cheerless
philosophy
of
george
eliot
is
fully
brought
out
mordecai
in
his
obscure
and
humble
life
is
a
good
representative
of
a
patient
sufferer
but
in
his
views
and
aspirations
is
a
sort
of
jewish
mazzini
the
hero
of
the
story
is
disciple
who
has
discovered
his
hebrew
origin
of
which
he
is
as
proud
as
his
aristocratic
mother
is
ashamed
the
heroine
is
a
spoiled
woman
of
fashion
who
makes
the
usual
mistake
of
most
of
george
eliot
heroines
in
violating
conscience
and
duty
she
marries
a
man
whom
she
knows
to
be
inherently
depraved
and
selfish
marries
him
for
his
money
and
pays
the
usual
penalty
a
life
of
silent
wretchedness
and
secret
sorrow
and
unavailing
regret
but
she
is
at
last
fortunately
delivered
by
the
accidental
death
of
her
detested
husband
by
drowning
of
course
remorse
in
seeing
her
murderous
wishes
accomplished
though
not
by
her
own
hand
but
by
pursuing
fate
awakens
a
new
life
in
her
soul
and
she
is
redeemed
amid
the
throes
of
anguish
and
conscious
guilt
theophrastus
such
the
last
work
of
george
eliot
is
not
a
novel
but
a
series
of
character
sketches
full
of
unusual
bitterness
and
withering
sarcasm
thackeray
never
wrote
anything
so
severe
it
is
one
of
the
most
cynical
books
ever
written
by
man
or
woman
there
is
as
much
difference
in
tone
and
spirit
between
it
and
adam
bede
as
between
proverbs
and
ecclesiastes
as
between
sartor
resartus
and
the
pamphlets
and
this
difference
is
not
more
marked
than
the
difference
in
style
and
language
between
this
and
her
earlier
novels
critics
have
been
unanimous
in
their
admiration
of
the
author
style
in
silas
marner
and
the
mill
on
the
floss
so
clear
direct
simple
natural
as
faultless
as
swift
addison
and
goldsmith
those
great
masters
of
english
prose
whose
fame
rests
as
much
on
their
style
as
on
their
thoughts
in
theophrastus
such
on
the
contrary
as
in
some
parts
of
daniel
deronda
the
sentences
are
long
involved
and
often
almost
unintelligible
in
presenting
the
works
of
george
eliot
i
have
confined
myself
to
her
prose
productions
since
she
is
chiefly
known
by
her
novels
but
she
wrote
poetry
also
and
some
critics
have
seen
considerable
merit
in
it
yet
whatever
merit
it
may
have
i
must
pass
without
notice
i
turn
from
the
criticism
of
her
novels
as
they
successively
appeared
to
allude
briefly
to
her
closing
days
her
health
began
to
fail
when
she
was
writing
middlemarch
doubtless
from
her
intense
and
continual
studies
which
were
a
severe
strain
on
her
nervous
system
it
would
seem
that
she
led
a
secluded
life
rarely
paying
visits
but
receiving
at
her
house
distinguished
literary
and
scientific
men
she
was
fond
of
travelling
on
the
continent
and
of
making
short
visits
to
the
country
in
conversation
she
is
said
to
have
been
witty
tolerant
and
sympathetic
poetry
music
and
art
absorbed
much
of
her
attention
she
read
very
little
contemporaneous
fiction
and
seldom
any
criticisms
on
her
own
productions
for
an
unbeliever
in
historical
christianity
she
had
great
reverence
for
all
earnest
christian
peculiarities
from
roman
catholic
asceticism
to
methodist
fervor
in
her
own
belief
she
came
nearest
to
the
positivism
of
comte
although
he
was
not
so
great
an
oracle
to
her
as
he
was
to
lewes
with
whom
twenty
years
were
passed
by
her
in
congenial
studies
and
labors
they
were
generally
seen
together
at
the
opening
night
of
a
new
play
or
the
of
a
famous
singer
or
actor
and
sometimes
within
a
limited
circle
they
attended
a
social
or
literary
reunion
in
george
eliot
lost
the
companion
of
her
literary
life
and
yet
two
years
afterward
at
the
age
of
she
surprised
her
friends
by
marrying
john
walter
cross
a
man
much
younger
than
herself
no
one
can
fathom
that
mystery
but
cross
did
not
long
enjoy
the
felicities
of
married
life
in
six
months
from
her
marriage
after
a
pleasant
trip
to
the
continent
she
took
cold
in
attending
a
sunday
concert
in
london
and
on
the
of
december
she
passed
away
from
earth
to
join
her
choir
invisible
whose
thoughts
have
enriched
the
world
it
is
not
extravagant
to
say
that
george
eliot
left
no
living
competitor
equal
to
herself
in
the
realm
of
fiction
i
do
not
myself
regard
her
as
great
a
novelist
as
scott
or
thackeray
but
critics
generally
place
her
second
only
to
those
great
masters
in
this
department
of
literature
how
long
her
fame
will
last
who
can
tell
admirers
and
rhetoricians
say
as
long
as
the
language
in
which
her
books
are
written
she
doubtless
will
live
as
long
as
any
english
novelist
but
do
those
who
amuse
live
like
those
who
save
will
the
witty
sayings
of
dickens
be
cherished
like
the
almost
inspired
truths
of
plato
of
bacon
of
burke
nor
is
popularity
a
sure
test
of
posthumous
renown
the
question
for
us
to
settle
is
not
whether
george
eliot
as
a
writer
is
immortal
but
whether
she
has
rendered
services
that
her
country
and
mankind
will
value
she
has
undoubtedly
added
to
the
richness
of
english
literature
she
has
deeply
interested
and
instructed
her
generation
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
owe
to
her
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
the
enjoyment
she
has
afforded
them
how
many
an
idle
hour
has
she
not
beguiled
how
many
have
felt
the
artistic
delight
she
has
given
them
like
those
who
have
painted
beautiful
pictures
as
already
remarked
we
read
her
descriptions
of
rural
character
and
life
as
we
survey
the
masterpieces
of
hogarth
and
wilkie
it
is
for
her
delineation
of
character
and
for
profound
psychological
analysis
that
her
writings
have
permanent
value
she
is
a
faithful
copyist
of
nature
she
recalls
to
our
minds
characters
whom
everybody
of
large
experience
has
seen
in
his
own
village
or
town
the
conscientious
clergyman
and
the
minister
who
preaches
like
a
lecturer
the
angel
who
lifts
up
and
the
sorceress
who
pulls
down
we
recall
the
misers
we
have
scorned
and
the
hypocrites
whom
we
have
detested
we
see
on
her
canvas
the
vulgar
rich
and
the
struggling
poor
the
pompous
man
of
success
and
the
man
of
misfortune
philanthropists
and
drunkards
lofty
heroines
and
silly
butterflies
benevolent
doctors
and
smiling
politicians
quacks
and
scoundrels
and
fools
mixed
up
with
noble
men
and
women
whose
aspirations
are
for
a
higher
life
people
of
kind
impulses
and
weak
wills
of
attractive
personal
beauty
with
meanness
of
mind
and
soul
we
do
not
find
exaggerated
monsters
of
vice
or
faultless
models
of
virtue
and
wisdom
we
see
such
people
as
live
in
every
christian
community
true
it
is
that
the
impression
we
receive
of
human
life
is
not
always
pleasant
but
who
in
any
community
can
bear
the
severest
scrutiny
of
neighbors
it
is
this
fidelity
to
our
poor
humanity
which
tinges
the
novels
of
george
eliot
with
so
deep
a
gloom
but
the
sadness
which
creeps
over
us
in
view
of
human
imperfection
is
nothing
to
that
darkness
which
enters
the
soul
when
the
peculiar
philosophical
or
theological
opinions
of
this
gifted
woman
are
insidiously
but
powerfully
introduced
however
great
she
was
as
a
delineator
of
character
she
is
not
an
oracle
as
a
moral
teacher
she
was
steeped
in
the
doctrines
of
modern
agnosticism
she
did
not
believe
in
a
personal
god
nor
in
his
superintending
providence
nor
in
immortality
as
brought
to
light
in
the
gospel
there
are
some
who
do
not
accept
historical
christianity
but
are
pervaded
with
its
spirit
even
carlyle
when
he
cast
aside
the
miracles
of
christ
and
his
apostles
as
the
honest
delusions
of
their
followers
was
almost
a
calvinist
in
his
recognition
of
god
as
a
sovereign
power
and
he
abhorred
the
dreary
materialism
of
comte
and
mill
as
much
as
he
detested
the
shallow
atheism
of
diderot
and
helvetius
but
george
eliot
went
beyond
carlyle
in
disbelief
at
times
especially
in
her
poetry
she
writes
almost
like
a
follower
of
buddha
the
individual
soul
is
absorbed
in
the
universal
whole
future
life
has
no
certainty
hope
in
redemption
is
buried
in
a
sepulchre
life
in
most
cases
is
a
futile
struggle
the
great
problems
of
existence
are
invested
with
gloom
as
well
as
mystery
thus
she
discourses
like
a
pagan
she
would
have
us
to
believe
that
theocritus
was
wiser
than
pascal
that
marcus
aurelius
was
as
good
as
saint
paul
hence
as
a
teacher
of
morals
and
philosophy
george
eliot
is
not
of
much
account
we
question
the
richness
of
any
moral
wisdom
which
is
not
in
harmony
with
the
truths
that
christian
people
regard
as
fundamental
and
which
they
believe
will
save
the
world
in
some
respects
she
has
taught
important
lessons
she
has
illustrated
the
power
of
conscience
and
the
sacredness
of
duty
she
was
a
great
preacher
of
the
doctrine
that
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
reap
she
showed
that
those
who
do
not
check
and
control
the
first
departure
from
virtue
will
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
hopelessly
fall
these
are
great
certitudes
but
there
are
others
which
console
and
encourage
as
well
as
intimidate
the
domine
of
the
dying
xavier
on
the
desolate
island
of
sancian
pierced
through
the
clouds
of
dreary
blackness
which
enveloped
the
nations
he
sought
to
save
christianity
is
full
of
promises
of
exultant
joy
and
its
firmest
believers
are
those
whose
lives
are
gilded
with
its
divine
radiance
surely
it
is
not
intellectual
or
religious
narrowness
which
causes
us
to
regret
that
so
gifted
a
woman
as
george
eliot
so
justly
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
ornaments
of
modern
literature
should
have
drifted
away
from
the
rock
which
has
resisted
the
storms
and
tempests
of
nearly
two
thousand
years
and
abandoned
if
she
did
not
scorn
the
faith
which
has
animated
the
great
masters
of
thought
from
augustine
to
bossuet
the
stern
mournfulness
which
is
produced
by
most
of
her
novels
gives
us
the
idea
of
one
who
does
not
know
or
who
has
forgotten
that
the
stone
was
rolled
away
from
the
heart
of
the
world
on
the
morning
when
christ
arose
from
the
tomb

rather

the

would
not
be

while
after

in
