conceded
always
everywhere
and
by

to
have
the

subject
that

the
text
of
this
remarkable
volume
the
story
of
the
origin

evolution
of

our
country
almost
from
the
very
inception
of
the
game
until
the
present
time
as
player
manager
and
magnate
spalding
has
been
closely
identified
with
its
interests
not
infrequently
he
has
been
called
upon
in
times
of
emergency
to
prevent
threatened
disaster
but
for
him
the
national
game
would
have
been
syndicated
and
controlled
by
elements
whose
interests
were
purely
selfish
and
personal
the
book
is
a
veritable
repository
of
information
concerning
players
clubs
and
personalities
connected
with
the
game
in
its
early
days
and
is
written
in
a
most
interesting
style
interspersed
with
enlivening
anecdotes
and
accounts
of
events
that
have
not
heretofore
been
published
the
response
on
the
part
of
the
press
and
the
public
to
efforts
to
perpetuate
the
early
history
of
the
national

has
been
very
encouraging

is
in
receipt
of
hundreds
of
letters

believe

just
at

particularly
perhaps
if

an
opportunity
to

not

thus
deserves
to
rank
with
other
great
men

who
have
contributed
to
its
success
it
would
have
added
to

albert
spalding
who
really
grew
up
with
the
sport
has
written
national
game
which
he
describes
as
not
a
history
but
the
simple
story
of
the
game
as
he
has
come
to
know
it
his
book
therefore
is
full
of
living
interest

is
a
volume
generously
illustrated
and
abounds
in

memories

a
mass
of
interesting
information
regarding

might
be
expected
in
spalding

game
it
is
safe
to
say
that
before
spalding
there
was
no
base
ball
the
book
is
no
record
of
games
and
players
but
it
is
historical
in
a
broader
sense
and
the
author
is
able
to
give
his
personal
decisive
testimony
about
many
disputed
points

albert

has
contributed
in
many
respects
the
most
interesting
work
pertaining
to

the
national
game
which
has
been
written
there
is
so
much
in
it
of
interest
that
the
temptation
not
to
put
it
down
until
it
is
completed
is
strong
within
the
mind
of
every
person
who
begins
to
read
it
as
a
historical
record
it
is
one
of
those
volumes
which
will
go
further
to
straighten
some
disputed
points

all
of

be
advanced

the

encountered

is
an
interesting
volume
for
anyone
who
follows
the
national

and
a
valuable
addition
to
any
library
no
book
on
base

has
ever
been
written
that
is
superior
to
this
one
by

the
book
is
admirably
written
yet
without
any
frills
many
of
the
more
notable
incidents
recounted
in
this
book
are
having
wide
publication
by
themselves
the
book
is
practically
a
compendium
of
the
salient
incidents
in
the
evolution
of
professional
base

spalding
is
fitted
to
perform
this
service
his
connection
with
the
game
having
been
contemporaneous
with
its
development
as
player
club
owner
and
league
director
this
work
appeals
with
peculiar
force
to
the
public
spalding
name
is
almost
synonymous
with
base
ball
he
has
worked
to
the
end
of
producing
a
volume
which
tells
the
story
of
the
game
vividly
and
accurately
taken
altogether
this
is
a
most
valuable
and
entertaining
work

it
is
most
appropriate
as
a
veteran
of

well
qualified
to
do
so
spalding
has
committed
to
print
a
professional
version
of
the
distinctly
american
game
this
well
known
base
ball
celebrity
has
a
store
of
familiar
anecdotes
embracing
the
entire

events
which
were
instrumental
in
guiding
the
destinies
of
the

during
the
trying
period

early
days
to
write
upon

in
a
historical
manner

yet
not
fall
into
the
habit
of
quoting
interminable
statistics
is
a
feat

accomplish

saw
it
and
no
man
has
been
in
position
to
see
more
when
spalding
the
sinewy
pitcher
of
nearly
forty
years
ago
came
into

the

through

approaches

reads

i
can

introduction
in
preparing
this
issue
of
spalding
official
base
ball
guide
for
the
season
of
it
has
occurred
to
the
editor
that
the
season
of
and
the
period
which
followed
its
completion
have
been
filled
with
a
great
deal
of
unusual
and
uncommon
vicissitude
in
the
first
place
the
personnel
of
the
national
league
the
oldest
base
ball
organization
in
the
world
has
been
greatly
changed
by
reason
of
death
and
purchase
of
one
franchise
new
owners
have
brought
new
faces
into
the
game
and
when
the
national
league
starts
on
this
campaign
there
will
be
some
younger
but
equally
as
ambitious
men
at
the
heads
of
some
of
the
clubs
the
players
have
effected
an
organization
that
too
is
an
incident
of
interest
for
it
is
well
within
the
memory
of
the
base
ball
fans
of
this
day
what
happened
when
another
organization
was
perfected
in
the
past
for
this
organization
it
may
be
said
that
the
members
promise
that
it
will
be
their
object
to
bring
about
better
deportment
on
the
part
of
their
own
associates
and
that
they
will
work
their
best
for
the
advancement
of
base
ball
from
a
professional
standpoint
if
they
do
this
they
will
be
of
benefit
to
the
sport
if
they
work
from
selfish
motives
it
is
inevitable
that
eventually
there
will
be
a
clash
as
there
was
in
the
past
the
last
world
series
which
was
played
was
the
greatest
special
series
of
games
which
has
been
played
in
the
history
of
the
national
pastime
there
may
have
been
single
games
and
there
may
have
been
series
which
have
attracted
their
full
measure
of
interest
from
the
base
ball
fans
but
there
never
has
been
a
special
series
so
filled
with
thrills
and
excitement
as
that
between
the
new
york
and
boston
clubs
the
guide
this
year
enters
into
the
subject
thoroughly
with
photographs
and
a
story
of
the
games
and
feels
that
the
readers
will
enjoy
the
account
of
the
contests
some
innovations
have
been
attempted
in
this
number
of
the
guide
which
should
interest
base
ball
readers
attention
is
called
to
the
symposium
by
prominent
base
ball
writers
which
brings
up
a
subject
of
interest
in
regard
to
future
world
series
there
are
other
special
articles
including
something
about
the
base
ball
writers
of
the
south
who
have
decided
to
organize
a
chapter
of
their
own
the
year
was
one
of
progress
and
advancement
on
the
part
of
base
ball
throughout
the
world
it
not
only
is
stronger
than
ever
as
america
national
game
but
it
is
making
fast
progress
in
other
countries
because
of
the
attractiveness
of
the
pastime
the
editor
of
the
guide
wishes
its
thousands
of
readers
an
even
more
enjoyable
base
ball
year
in
than
they
had
in
this
publication
is
now
one
of
worldwide
circulation
and
carries
the
gospel
of
base
ball
not
only
across
the
atlantic
ocean
but
across
the
pacific
ocean
as
well
one
of
these
days
it
may
be
its
province
to
report
a
series
for
the
international
championship
and
then
base
ball
will
have
become
the
universal
game
of
the
world
a
place
toward
which
it
is
rapidly
tending

foster
progress
of
america
national
game
two
more
nations
have
been
conquered
by
the
national
game
of
the
united
states
a
whole
race
has
succumbed
to
the
fascinations
of
the
greatest
of
all
outdoor
sports
both
france
and
sweden
have
announced
their
intention
of
organizing
base
ball
leagues
that
of
sweden
is
well
under
way
indeed
they
have
a
club
in
stockholm
and
there
are
more
to
follow
while
the
french
who
have
gradually
been
awakening
to
the
joys
of
athletic
pastime
in
which
they
have
hitherto
chosen
to
participate
in
other
ways
hope
to
have
a
new
league
by
the
expiration
of
the
present
summer
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
their
intention
to
play
base
ball
they
are
making
efforts
to
procure
suitable
players
from
the
united
states
to
coach
them
and
the
french
promoters
of
the
sport
are
determined
that
their
young
men
shall
be
given
every
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
the
game
of
which
they
have
heard
so
much
and
have
seen
so
little
last
year
in
the
guide
it
was
the
pleasure
of
the
editor
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
japanese
had
so
thoroughly
grasped
base
ball
that
they
were
bent
on
some
day
playing
an
american
team
for
the
international
championship
it
is
not
probable
that
such
a
series
will
take
place
within
the
next
five
years
but
not
improbable
that
it
will
take
place
within
the
next
decade
when
the
japanese
learn
to
bat
better
and
with
more
effect
they
will
become
more
dangerous
rivals
to
the
peace
of
mind
of
the
american
players
they
have
grasped
the
general
theory
of
the
game
amazingly
well
and
they
field
well
but
they
have
yet
to
develop
some
of
those
good
old
fashioned
clean
up
hitters
in
which
the
fans
of
the
united
states
revel
this
season
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
editor
of
the
guide
that
more
progress
has
been
made
in
china
in
regard
to
base
ball
than
in
any
fifty
years
preceding
true
there
was
not
much
base
ball
in
the
fifty
years
preceding
but
now
there
is
there
is
a
league
at
hong
kong
there
are
base
ball
teams
at
shanghai
and
other
cities
eliot
former
president
of
harvard
who
recently
returned
from
a
trip
around
the
world
holds
that
base
ball
has
done
more
to
humanize
and
civilize
the
chinese
than
any
influence
which
has
been
introduced
by
foreigners
basing
his
statement
on
the
fact
that
the
introduction
of
the
sport
among
the
younger
chinese
has
exerted
a
tremendous
restraint
upon
their
gambling
propensities
it
is
a
rather
queer
fact
that
where
the
civilizations
are
older
in
the
countries
of
the
occident
there
is
a
greater
tendency
to
gamble
especially
among
the
young
than
there
is
in
the
newer
america
doubtless
this
is
largely
due
to
the
lack
of
athletic
pastime
the
young
of
those
countries
know
little
or
nothing
about
simple
amusements
which
are
so
popular
in
the
united
states
and
acquire
from
their
elders
their
knowledge
of
betting
and
taking
part
in
games
of
chance
two
evils
which
unquestionably
have
done
much
to
degrade
the
race
as
a
whole
base
ball
has
caught
the
fancy
of
the
younger
generation
and
the
boys
once
they
get
a
ball
and
a
bat
in
their
hands
they
are
better
satisfied
with
them
than
with
all
the
gambling
devices
which
have
been
bequeathed
to
them
by
a
long
and
eminent
line
of
forefathers
so
it
would
appear
that
the
introduction
of
the
national
game
of
the
united
states
into
china
is
likely
to
exert
a
humanizing
influence
which
shall
go
further
than
legislation
or
sword
and
if
only
the
missionaries
had
grasped
earlier
the
wishes
and
the
tendency
of
the
younger
element
of
the
chinese
population
the
country
might
be
further
along
than
it
is
with
its
progressive
movement
in
the
philippine
islands
the
younger
generation
simply
has
gone
wild
over
base
ball
progress
has
been
noted
in
the
guide
from
time
to
time
of
the
increase
of
interest
but
it
is
now
at
such
a
pitch
that
the
boys
of
the
islands
wherever
base
ball
has
been
introduced
simply
have
deserted
everything
for
it
they
will
play
nothing
else
the
cockfights
and
the
gambling
games
which
were
also
a
part
of
the
amusement
of
the
younger
men
have
been
given
up
the
little
fellows
who
wear
not
much
more
than
a
breechclout
play
base
ball
they
have
picked
up
many
of
the
american
terms
and
one
of
the
most
amusing
of
experiences
is
to
stand
outside
the
walls
of
old
manila
and
hear
the
little
brown
boys
call
shoot
it
over
line
it
out
and
the
like
returning
to
their
native
language
and
jabbering
excitedly
in
filipino
whenever
they
arrive
at
some
point
of
play
in
which
their
command
of
english
fails
them
twenty
years
from
now
a
league
including
cities
of
the
philippines
china
and
japan
is
by
no
means
out
of
the
question
and
it
may
be
that
the
introduction
of
base
ball
into
all
three
countries
will
result
in
a
better
understanding
between
the
peoples
and
perhaps
bring
all
three
races
to
a
better
frame
of
mind
as
relates
to
their
personal
ambitions
and
rivalries
in
connection
with
the
widespread
influence
which
base
ball
is
having
on
both
sides
of
the
world
on
the
shores
of
the
pacific
ocean
and
on
those
of
the
atlantic
ocean
the
editor
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
theory
which
has
been
advanced
by
spalding
the
founder
of
the
guide
as
to
the
efficacy
of
base
ball
for
the
purpose
of
training
athletes
that
has
a
worldwide
application
spalding
contends
that
base
ball
has
lent
no
small
assistance
to
the
athletes
of
the
united
states
in
helping
them
to
win
premier
honors
at
the
olympic
games
since
their
reintroduction
spalding
was
the
first
american
commissioner
to
the
olympic
games
appointed
to
that
post
the
honor
being
conferred
upon
him
in
when
the
late
president
mckinley
gave
him
his
commission
to
represent
the
united
states
at
paris
in
spalding
with
his
analytical
mind
has
reasoned
out
a
theory
which
is
undoubtedly
of
great
accuracy
and
which
is
further
corroborated
by
an
interview
given
out
in
london
strangely
enough
on
the
same
day
that
spalding
gave
utterance
to
his
ideas
in
los
angeles
by
sullivan
american
commissioner
to
the
olympic
games
at
stockholm
last
year
while
returning
to
the
united
states
after
witnessing
the
triumphs
of
the
americans
spalding
said
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
at
all
surprised
at
the
result
at
stockholm
history
has
been
repeating
itself
in
this
way
ever
since
the
celebration
of
the
olympic
games
was
inaugurated
at
athens
america
won
the
victory
there
in
she
triumphed
again
at
paris
in
our
athletes
defeated
the
contestants
at
louis
in
the
victory
was
ours
at
london
in
and
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
we
would
win
at
stockholm
but
there
is
food
for
thought
in
this
uninterrupted
succession
of
triumphs
why
do
our
athletes
always
win
all
other
things
being
equal
the
contestants
in
the
country
holding
the
event
should
naturally
come
to
the
front
their
numbers
are
always
greater
than
those
from
any
other
country
and
the
home
grounds
influence
is
strong
however
that
advantage
has
not
in
any
case
prevented
american
success
therefore
there
must
be
a
cause
what
is
it
measured
by
scale
and
tape
our
athlete
are
not
so
much
superior
as
a
class
the
theory
of
beef
must
be
discarded
we
may
not
lay
claim
to
having
all
the
best
trainers
of
the
world
we
must
look
to
some
other
source
for
american
prowess
i
may
be
a
prejudiced
judge
but
i
believe
the
whole
secret
of
these
continued
successes
is
to
be
found
to
the
kind
of
training
that
comes
with
the
playing
of
america
national
game
and
our
competitors
in
other
lands
may
never
hope
to
reach
the
standard
of
american
athletes
until
they
learn
this
lesson
and
adopt
our
pastime
the
question
should
the
training
of
a
child
begin
has
been
wisely
answered
by
the
statement
that
it
should
antedate
his
birth
the
training
of
base
ball
may
not
go
back
quite
that
far
but
it
approaches
the
time
as
nearly
as
practicable
for
america
starts
training
of
future
olympian
winners
very
early
in
life
youngsters
not
yet
big
enough
to
attend
school
begin
quickening
their
eyesight
and
sharpening
their
wits
and
strengthening
their
hands
and
arms
and
legs
by
playing
on
base
ball
fields
ready
at
hand
in
the
meadows
of
farms
the
commons
of
villages
and
the
parks
of
cities
all
over
the
land
base
ball
combines
running
jumping
throwing
and
everything
that
constitutes
the
athletic
events
of
the
olympian
games
but
above
all
it
imparts
to
the
player
that
degree
of
confidence
in
competition
that
indefinable
something
that
enables
one
athlete
to
win
over
another
who
may
be
his
physical
equal
but
who
is
lacking
the
american
spirit
begotten
of
base
ball
an
analysis
of
the
olympian
games
shows
that
the
american
showed
to
best
advantage
in
contests
where
the
stress
of
competition
was
hardest
in
the
dashes
they
were
supreme
in
the
hurdles
they
were
in
a
class
by
themselves
and
in
the
high
jump
and
pole
vault
there
was
no
one
worthy
of
their
steel
whenever
quick
thinking
and
acting
was
required
an
american
was
in
front
does
not
this
fact
prove
that
the
american
game
of
base
ball
enables
the
player
to
determine
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
what
to
do
to
defeat
his
contestant
what
a
season
of
base
ball
costs
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
say
a
few
words
in
regard
to
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
base
ball
there
are
some
sensational
writers
whose
hobby
is
to
inform
the
public
about
the
great
receipts
in
base
ball
usually
they
exaggerate
from
to
per
cent
now
as
to
the
expense

dozen
and
one
other
things
to
say
nothing
of
that
old
item
wear
and
tear
the
receipts
of
base
ball
barely
cover
these
expenditures
the
alleged
profits
of
base
ball
mostly
are
fanciful
dreams
of
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
practical
side
of
the
sport
and
are
stunned
when
they
are
made
acquainted
with
the
real
financial
problems
which
confront
club
owners
but
the
money
that
is
contributed
to
the
support
of
the
game
almost
immediately
finds
its
way
back
into
public
channels
less
than
thirty
per
cent
of
base
ball
clubs
realize
what
a
business
man
would
call
a
fair
return
on
the
amount
invested
a
writer
on
economic
topics
interviewed
owners
of
base
ball
clubs
as
to
their
income
and
outgo
one
of
the
best
known
of
the
national
league
men
took
the
writer
into
his
office
and
spread
the
cash
book
of
the
club
business
before
him
you
may
go
through
it
if
you
wish
said
the
owner
but
here
is
the
balance
for
the
last
day
of
the
year
it
read
as
follows
receipts
expenditures
that
answer
enough
for
me
said
the
writer
i
am
through
with
any
more
essays
on
the
affluence
of
base
ball
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
extend
them
the
hand
of
charity
than
the
mailed
fist
the
new
organization
of
players
the
formation
of
an
organization
on
the
part
of
the
major
league
ball
players
during
the
closing
days
of
the
season
of
was
looked
upon
with
some
misgivings
by
those
who
remember
only
too
well
what
happened
when
a
prior
organization
of
ball
players
was
formed
in
the
present
instance
those
foremost
in
perfecting
the
organization
have
also
been
foremost
in
asserting
that
the
players
principal
aim
is
to
with
the
club
owners
if
this
object
is
followed
with
fidelity
and
to
its
ultimate
conclusion
there
is
no
necessity
to
fear
any
grave
disturbances
but
there
is
a
dread
that
dread
which
is
the
fear
of
the
child
that
has
had
its
hands
burned
by
the
flame
that
a
selfish
coterie
of
players
might
obtain
control
of
the
organization
set
up
a
policy
of
unscrupulous
defiance
and
destructive
opposition
and
retard
for
a
moment
the
higher
development
of
the
game
there
is
no
organization
either
of
unscrupulous
base
ball
players
or
unscrupulous
club
owners
which
will
ever
find
it
possible
to
destroy
organized
base
ball
the
results
that
organized
base
ball
have
brought
about
will
never
be
annihilated
although
grave
injury
could
be
temporarily
wrought
by
a
force
defiant
to
tie
unusual
demands
made
by
the
sport
to
perpetuate
itself
successfully
it
is
simply
out
of
the
question
to
control
base
ball
as
one
would
control
the
affairs
of
a
department
store
base
ball
has
its
commercial
side
but
its
commercial
side
can
not
maintain
it
with
success
there
must
be
a
predominant
factor
based
upon
the
encouragement
that
brings
forth
admiration
for
a
high
class
sport
this
factor
can
only
be
fostered
by
the
ability
to
maintain
not
one
but
a
group
of
high
class
teams
any
ball
player
imbued
with
the
idea
that
the
stars
should
be
grouped
together
in
the
city
best
able
to
pay
the
highest
salaries
simply
is
an
enemy
to
his
career
and
to
those
of
his
fellow
players
without
some
handicap
to
assist
in
the
equalizing
of
the
strength
of
base
ball
nines
of
the
professional
leagues
there
will
be
no
prosperity
for
the
leagues
or
the
clubs
individually
no
better
evidence
may
be
cited
to
prove
this
than
the
fact
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
in
the
smaller
leagues
base
ball
enthusiasts
in
the
city
best
able
to
pay
the
largest
salaries
frequently
withdraw
their
support
of
the
team
because
it
wins
all
the
time
base
ball
in
its
professional
atmosphere
is
nearer
an
ideal
sport
a
better
managed
sport
and
a
more
fairly
and
equitably
adjusted
sport
than
it
ever
has
been
which
is
manifest
proof
of
its
superior
evolution
had
results
been
otherwise
it
would
have
retrograded
and
possibly
passed
out
of
existence
carefully
comparing
its
management
with
that
of
all
other
sports
in
history
the
editor
of
the
guide
believes
that
it
is
the
best
managed
sport
in
the
world
it
is
true
that
improvements
can
be
made
it
is
evident
that
there
are
still
commercialized
owners
not
over
capitalized
with
a
spirit
of
sport
it
is
undeniable
that
there
are
ball
players
not
imbued
with
a
high
tone
of
the
obligations
which
they
owe
to
their
employers
and
to
the
public
but
it
is
as
certain
as
the
existence
of
the
game
that
progress
has
been
made
and
that
it
has
not
ceased
to
move
forward
for
that
reason
players
and
owners
must
be
guided
by
a
sense
of
lofty
ideals
and
not
be
led
astray
by
foolish
outbursts
over
trivial
differences
of
opinion
easily
to
be
adjusted
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
common
sense
base
ball
played
in
sweden
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
base
ball
for
all
the
world
for
which
the
guide
expounds
and
spreads
the
gospel
the
editor
would
submit
a
very
interesting
letter
received
by
him
from
sweden
it
reads
as
follows
westeras
sweden
to
the
editor
of
the
guide
we
hereby
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
two
copies
of
the
rules
translated
and
issued
by
the
westeras
base
ball
club
into
swedish
from
the
spalding
base
ball
guide
the
work
of
getting
the
book
out
has
been
somewhat
slow
on
account
of
that
the
work
of
translating
proofreading
all
had
to
be
done
on
our
spare
time
but
it
is
done
now
and
i
think
we
have
succeeded
pretty
well
everything
considered
the
books
will
be
distributed
by
a
book
firm
bjork
boyeson
stockholm
and
will
soon
be
available
in
all
the
bookstores
in
sweden
we
got
some
advance
copies
out
just
in
time
for
the
olympic
games
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
presenting
some
copies
to
commissioner
thompson
manager
halpin
and
others
of
the
american
olympic
committee
as
you
know
so
did
we
have
a
game
of
base
ball
at
stockholm
with
one
of
the
finland
teams
and
as
it
may
be
of
some
interest
to
you
to
know
the
preliminaries
to
the
game
i
am
writing
to
relate
how
it
happened
in
trying
to
arrange
for
some
amusements
in
the
evenings
at
the
stadium
the
olympic
committee
wrote
us
if
we
would
be
willing
to
take
part
in
a
game
of
base
ball
at
stadium
some
evening
during
the
stadium
week
as
our
club
this
year
was
in
poor
condition
on
account
of
some
of
our
best
players
being
out
on
military
duties
we
hesitated
at
first
but
then
decided
to
risk
it
knowing
very
well
that
whoever
we
would
play
against
they
would
not
rub
in
to
us
too
hard
we
pointed
out
to
the
olympic
committee
that
it
would
not
be
very
hard
to
get
a
team
of
base
ball
players
picked
out
from
the
american
athletes
taking
part
in
the
contests
but
as
they
would
not
be
prepared
for
base
ball
suits
and
other
needed
articles
had
to
be
provided
for
we
were
then
told
to
get
necessary
things
ordered
and
so
we
did
we
ordered
suits
from
a
tailor
in
this
town
after
a
pattern
that
i
got
from
spalding
this
spring
the
suits
were
of
gray
flannel
with
blue
trimmings
for
our
team
and
red
trimmings
for
the
american
i
also
ordered
bats
and
gloves
and
with
the
things
our
club
already
had
we
were
very
well
equipped
the
olympic
committee
stockholm
then
received
a
letter
from
the
olympic
committee
new
york
saying
that
if
a
game
of
base
ball
could
be
arranged
for
during
the
olympian
games
they
would
bring
two
teams
along
on
the
finland
the
olympic
committee
cabled
to
come
along
and
sent
us
a
copy
of
sullivan
letter
i
knew
of
course
that
if
the
game
could
be
played
by
two
american
teams
it
would
be
a
much
better
game
than
if
our
team
took
part
and
told
the
olympic
committee
and
wanted
to
withdraw
but
as
they
did
not
know
for
sure
how
it
would
be
told
us
to
go
ahead
with
the
arrangements
just
the
same
and
so
we
did
and
by
the
time
the
finland
arrived
everything
had
been
arranged
for
the
olympic
committee
has
selected
the
evening
of
the
of
july
for
the
game
and
thought
that
this
would
be
suitable
to
the
americans
but
as
some
of
the
players
had
to
take
part
in
the
contests
halpin
would
not
risk
them
then
so
it
was
finally
decided
that
a
game
should
be
played
the
the
americans
to
play
six
innings
between
themselves
and
then
six
innings
against
us
well
we
had
a
game
at
the
training
grounds
we
played
six
innings
and
halpin
was
kind
enough
to
let
us
have
a
pitcher
and
catcher
from
his
men
the
score
was
to
and
it
could
just
as
well
been
to
perhaps
well
at
any
rate
it
was
the
first
base
ball
game
as
far
as
i
know
that
ever
took
place
in
europe
between
an
american
team
and
a
european
team
with
england
possibly
excepted
halpin
said
that
the
americans
were
going
to
play
a
game
the
next
morning
between
themselves
but
that
game
did
not
come
off
there
was
probably
no
time
for
it
as
the
finland
left
stockholm
the
same
day
very
likely
the
american
boys
were
somewhat
disappointed
in
not
being
able
to
play
between
themselves
as
anticipated
and
perhaps
i
should
not
have
pushed
our
game
ahead
but
as
long
as
there
was
a
base
ball
team
in
sweden
it
would
have
been
strange
if
it
had
not
played
and
it
gave
our
boys
a
chance
to
see
how
the
game
should
be
played
and
they
certainly
did
take
it
in
had
the
game
been
played
as
it
was
intended
and
advertised
on
the
in
the
stadium
there
would
very
likely
have
been
a
bigger
crowd
present
and
the
game
would
also
have
been
more
talked
about
in
the
papers
but
then
we
will
have
to
be
satisfied
as
it
is
our
club
has
been
practicing
all
summer
twice
a
week
and
on
the
of
august
we
gave
an
exhibition
game
here
at
westeras
between
two
teams
from
our
club
the
suits
made
for
the
olympic
games
coming
in
very
handy
i
send
you
herewith
a
clipping
from
a
local
paper
describing
the
game
and
also
a
picture
of
the
two
teams
with
myself
and
the
umpire
included
at
our
game
here
we
distributed
the
description
of
base
ball
written
by
you
and
translated
into
swedish
and
it
came
of
good
use
next
year
we
intend
to
have
our
teams
appear
in
the
nearby
cities
around
here
so
as
to
give
people
a
chance
to
see
the
game
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
they
will
start
it
in
stockholm
so
i
think
the
game
is
bound
to
be
popular
here
also
george
wright
of
boston
was
the
umpire
at
the
stockholm
games
and
as
he
was
very
kind
to
us
we
would
like
to
send
him
the
picture
of
the
club
and
hope
that
you
will
forward
us
his
address
i
am
for
westeras

truly
edwin
johnson
electrical
engineer
the
new
national
agreement
unlimited
satisfaction
must
be
had
by
all
who
are
connected
with
base
ball
over
the
greatly
improved
conditions
by
which
the
season
of
is
begun
under
the
new
national
agreement
while
it
perhaps
might
be
exaggerated
boastfulness
to
affirm
that
base
ball
as
a
professionally
organized
sport
has
attained
perfection
it
is
not
out
of
reason
indeed
quite
within
reason
to
observe
that
base
ball
never
had
such
a
well
balanced
and
perfect
organization
as
that
by
which
it
is
regulated
at
the
present
time
the
principal
fact
of
congratulation
lies
in
the
safeguards
and
provisions
which
have
been
thrown
around
the
players
of
the
minor
leagues
and
in
the
equitable
and
just
measures
which
have
been
agreed
upon
to
provide
for
their
future
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
players
of
the
major
leagues
can
take
care
of
themselves
that
is
to
say
their
positions
if
they
are
expert
in
their
calling
and
conscientious
in
their
deportment
really
take
care
of
them
no
club
owner
unless
he
is
maliciously
or
foolishly
inclined
will
jeopardize
the
interests
of
his
team
by
acting
in
a
wilfully
unjust
manner
toward
a
player
who
is
cheerfully
and
uprightly
offering
his
services
we
may
hear
of
occasional
exceptions
to
this
condition
of
things
but
if
these
occasional
exceptions
chance
to
arise
it
is
inevitably
certain
that
the
owner
in
the
long
run
will
suffer
to
a
greater
degree
than
the
player
with
whom
he
deals
unfairly
it
is
the
history
of
base
ball
that
more
inequitable
treatment
has
arisen
by
fifty
per
cent
in
the
minor
leagues
than
has
had
its
origin
in
the
major
leagues
the
reason
for
this
existed
almost
wholly
in
the
inability
of
base
ball
as
a
whole
to
bring
the
minor
league
owners
to
a
realization
of
the
injury
that
they
might
be
doing
and
to
extend
such
punishment
and
insist
upon
such
regulation
as
were
necessary
to
change
this
undesirable
condition
by
the
organization
of
the
national
association
of
base
ball
clubs
the
minor
leagues
for
the
first
time
in
their
history
placed
themselves
in
a
position
where
they
could
demand
proper
enforcement
of
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
sport
and
by
their
alliance
with
the
major
league
clubs
under
the
articles
of
the
national
agreement
a
general
working
basis
was
effected
whereby
compliance
with
rules
could
be
insisted
upon
the
result
of
this
admirable
condition
of
affairs
is
that
wisdom
and
equity
now
rule
where
there
once
existed
chaos
and
at
times
something
akin
to
anarchy
in
sport
at
no
time
in
the
history
of
the
game
which
is
so
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
has
the
general
legislative
and
executive
body
been
so
well
equipped
by
the
adoption
of
pertinent
and
virile
laws
to
insist
upon
justice
to
all
concerned
as
at
the
present
moment
the
new
national
agreement
is
an
improvement
upon
the
old
and
the
old
was
a
long
long
step
in
advance
of
anything
which
had
preceded
it
the
mere
fact
that
club
owners
and
leagues
were
so
willing
to
adopt
a
system
better
than
its
predecessor
wholly
confutes
the
absurd
assertions
of
the
radical
element
that
there
is
no
consideration
shown
for
the
player
to
the
contrary
every
consideration
has
been
shown
to
the
player
but
the
latter
must
not
confound
with
the
consideration
shown
to
him
the
idea
that
his
interests
are
the
only
interests
at
stake
in
base
ball
the
man
who
is
willing
to
furnish
the
sinews
of
war
has
as
good
standing
in
court
as
the
player
who
furnishes
the
base
hits
and
the
phenomenal
catches
so
perfect
is
the
system
which
is
being
attempted
to
be
set
in
force
by
the
new
national
agreement
that
the
young
man
who
now
essays
to
play
professional
base
ball
may
be
assured
of
steady
advancement
in
this
profession
and
a
generally
improving
condition
if
he
will
be
as
honest
by
his
employer
as
he
expects
his
employer
to
be
honest
by
him
the
graduated
system
of
assisting
players
step
by
step
from
the
least
important
leagues
to
the
most
important
is
the
most
perfect
plan
of
its
kind
that
has
ever
been
devised
there
may
be
flaws
in
it
but
if
there
are
they
will
be
remedied
and
if
modifications
are
necessary
to
make
it
more
perfect
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
modifications
will
be
agreed
upon
as
proof
of
what
the
new
national
agreement
may
do
although
it
has
barely
had
time
to
be
considered
the
editor
of
the
guide
would
submit
the
following
for
consideration
ever
since
the
national
agreement
was
organized
the
members
have
always
striven
to
aid
the
players
in
their
efforts
to
gain
the
top
rank
in
the
great
national
game
they
have
had
a
hard
proposition
in
handling
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
brought
to
their
attention
but
their
decisions
in
all
cases
were
absolutely
fair
and
impartial
then
the
matter
of
the
new
agreement
occasioned
many
hours
of
laborious
work
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
the
commission
and
when
the
instrument
was
finally
announced
it
meant
that
all
of
the
parties
to
such
an
agreement
were
satisfied
and
that
there
could
be
no
improvement
there
was
one
detail
that
covered
a
wide
field
and
that
was
in
the
matter
of
players
drafted
by
the
two
big
leagues
and
later
sent
back
to
the
minors
under
the
old
national
agreement
it
was
possible
to
pick
up
a
player
by
means
of
the
annual
draft
from
one
of
the
class
c
leagues
and
just
before
the
opening
of
the
season
send
him
back
to
the
club
from
whence
he
came
without
ever
having
given
him
a
chance
to
land
with
a
club
in
some
higher
organization
realizing
that
such
players
were
not
given
a
chance
to
advance
in
the
base
ball
profession
this
matter
was
thoroughly
thrashed
out
and
the
new
ruling
under
which
all
of
the
national
agreement
clubs
operate
was
adopted
now
it
is
possible
for
a
player
in
any
of
the
smaller
leagues
to
be
drafted
by
a
major
league
club
and
when
the
latter
party
does
not
care
to
retain
possession
of
such
a
player
he
is
first
offered
to
the
class
aa
clubs
all
of
these
clubs
must
waive
on
him
before
he
can
be
dropped
farther
down
in
the
list
and
if
such
should
be
the
case
he
would
then
be
offered
to
the
class
a
clubs
in
that
way
the
player
although
he
is
not
fast
enough
to
remain
in
the
two
major
leagues
is
always
given
a
chance
to
advance
for
if
any
of
the
clubs
in
those
classes
higher
than
that
from
which
he
came
had
grabbed
him
he
was
bound
to
receive
an
increase
in
salary
that
meant
that
he
had
his
chance
to
advance
and
that
was
the
sole
purpose
of
the
national
agreement
in
drafting
such
a
rule
during
the
past
drafting
season
there
were
players
drafted
by
the
two
major
league
clubs
and
of
that
number
have
already
been
sent
back
to
the
minor
leagues
the
class
aa
and
a
clubs
claimed
all
of
these
and
it
is
more
than
likely
that
there
will
also
be
many
more
who
will
be
given
trials
by
the
big
league
clubs
during
the
spring
training
season
and
who
may
later
be
turned
back
to
the
minors
of
the
players
thus
far
sent
back
seventeen
of
them

their

much
discussion
arose
after
the
finish
of
the
last
world
series
as
to
whether
the
adjustment
of
dates
had
worked
satisfactorily
the
contention
was
that
playing
off
a
tie
game
on
the
ground
where
the
game
had
been
scheduled
might
work
some
inconvenience
to
fans
and
result
in
an
inequitable
allotment
of
dates
simply
to
conform
to
custom
it
was
asserted
that
the
importance
of
the
series
demanded
that
it
be
a
affair
dates
to
alternate
regularly
regardless
of
all
ties
or
drawn
games
to
obtain
opinion
that
is
sound
and
practical
the
editor
of
the
guide
sent
forth
the
following
letter
new
york
january
during
the
recent
world
series
it
so
happened
that
a
tie
was
played
in
one
of
the
cities
which
compelled
both
teams
to
remain
in
that
city
for
another
date
before
the
series
was
over
this
arrangement
resulted
in
one
club
having
five
games
on
its
home
grounds
and
the
other
club
having
but
three
games
on
its
home
grounds
it
has
seemed
to
some
that
it
is
unjust
it
is
also
contended
that
it
is
unfair
to
the
patrons
of
the
game
to
schedule
a
contest
and
then
not
play
in
the
city
specified
after
some
had
traveled
many
miles
to
see
it
will
you
please
give
the
guide
your
opinion
as
to
whether
a
change
would
be
advisable

of
opinion
as
follows
so
far
as
having
any
effect
on
the
chances
of
the
two

is
concerned
i
do
think
having
to
play
more
games
on
one
ground
than
on
the
other
makes
any
material
difference
where
cities
are
sufficiently
near
each
other
for
games
to
be
alternated
daily
it
would
perhaps
be
fairer
to
spectators
to
do
so
irrespective
of
ties
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
a
tie
on
one
grounds
should
be
played
off
the
next
day
in
the
same
city
hanna
york
in
my
opinion
the
arrangement
on
tie
games
in
the
contests
is
a
poor
one
i
saw
the
result
of
it
in
the
series
between
the
cubs
and
white
sox
last
fall
two
tie
games
were
played
and
the
confusion
and
inconvenience
it
caused
the
fans
was
deplorable
it
is
unjust
to
the
followers
who
support
base
ball
it
is
also
unjust
in
a
small
way
to
the
club
which
has
to
play
two
or
more
games
on
its
opponent
field
players
when
away
from
their
home
grounds
in
a
fall
series
are
more
or
less
under
a
nervous
strain
if
there
was
confusion
inconvenience
and
difficulty
in
a
local
series
as
a
result
of
a
tie
game
the
folly
of
the
arrangement
must
appear
more
absurd
when
towns
like
new
york
and
boston
are
involved
dates
should
alternate
tie
or
not
tie
oscar
reichow
daily
we
are
in
receipt
of
your
favor
of
the
and
wish
to
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
presented
it
is
our
opinion
that
a
tie
game
was
played
and
it
should
be
considered
as
a
game
either
side
had
an
opportunity
to
win
and
any
advantage
that
the
home
club
might
have
had
was
lost
when
it
failed
to
break
the
tie
it
is
therefore
our
belief
that
this
game
should
have
been
played
in
the
other
city
as
to
it
being
unfair
to
the
patrons
who
had
traveled
so
far
to
see
the
scheduled
contest
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
were
afforded
a
sufficient
amount
of
amusement
and
excitement
for
their
trouble
in
witnessing
a
closely
played
contest
spink

it
seems
to
me
that
the
game
should
be
alternated

the
contending
cities

of

the
tie
game
gave
boston
five
games
on
the
home
grounds
while
the

had
only
three
besides
many
persons
who
traveled
to
see
the
games
in

inconvenienced

think
that
the

of

any
extra
playing
or
should
be
done

now
prevails
while
the
situation
which
arose
last

did
seem
unjust
to
the

think
the
very
fact
that
boston
had
five
games
on
its
home

the

three
on

was
an
answer

to
raise
the
cry
of
hippodroming
that
same
situation
is
not
likely
to
again
arise
for
a
long
time
and
i
believe
the
rule
as
it
stands
is
a
guarantee
to
the
public

the
strict
honesty

i

it
might
be
fairer

both

play
a
regular
schedule
regardless
of
the
fact
that
any
tie

may
arise
in

under
the
old
system
of
playing
the
tie
off
in
the
city
where
the
tie

is
played
it
brings
about
a
great
deal
of
confusion
many

make
arrangements
to
see
a
game
on
a
certain
day
and
are
greatly
disappointed
when
the

is
played
in
a
different
city

the
old
rule
of
playing
the
game
on
the

as
the

is
fair
to

the
rules
regarding
the
manner
of
scheduling
games
for

should
not
be
changed
there
are
times
when
they
apparently
work
a
hardship
to
one
team
or
the
followers
of
one
club
but
after
all
they
help
to
throw
the
necessary
safeguards
around
the
contests
as
for
the
argument
for
not
playing
off
a
tie
game
on
the
same
grounds
thus
disarranging
the
dates
and
inconveniencing
the
fans
patrons
of
the
world
series
games
are
accustomed
to
this
since
bad
weather
frequently
cuts
into
the
event
and
causes
postponements
in
a
way
it
does
not
appear
fair
that
one
club
should
have
the
privilege
of
playing
five
games
at
home
to
three
games
at
home
for
its
opponents
the
rule
of
playing
off
a
tie
game
on
the

is
a
fixture
in

this
was
a
question

have
to
trust
to
luck
as
to
the
number
of
games
they
will
see
in

william

evening
it
was
of
course
to
the
disadvantage
of

to
be
obliged
to
play
five
of
the
eight
games
in
the
series
last
fall
on
the
grounds
of
their
opponents
but
this
came
as
a
result
of
one
tie
game
on
the
boston
grounds
and
being
outlucked
on
the
toss
to
determine
where
the
deciding
game
should
be
played
this
tie
game
unquestionably
caused
much
inconvenience
to
patrons
because
of
the
change
in
the
schedule
made
necessary
because
of
it
it
is
not
clear
to
me
however
just
now
these
things
can
be
remedied
without
disturbing
the
balance
of
an
even
break
for
both
teams
more
violently
than
was
the
case
last
fall
i
do
not
believe
there
will
be
another
series
just
like
the
one
of
and
so
in
my
opinion
an
immediate
change
in
the
conditions
governing
these
series
would
not
be
advisable
it
is
not
clear
to
me
just
what
changes
could
be
made
one
club
or
the
other
is
bound
to
have
the
advantage
of
an
extra
game
on
its
own
grounds
providing
seven
games
are
necessary
the
championship
in
nine
out
of
ten
contests
will
be
decided
in
seven
games
or
less
then
as
to
having
the
games
played
according
to
an
arbitrarily
fixed
schedule
so
as
not
to
inconvenience
patrons
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
being
open
to
the
objection
that
it
would
then
be
possible
to
have
every
game
that
figures
in
the
result
of
the
series
played
on
the
home
grounds
of
one
of
the
contestants
for
instance
tie
games
or
unfavorable
weather
which
would
prevent
a
game
being
played
in
one
city
would
throw
all
the
games
to
the
other
city
where
there
might
be
no
tie
games
nor
unfavorable
weather
that
would
mean
four
straight
if
it
so
happened
that
the
home
team
won
the
games
and
the
loser
would
never
have
gotten
action
on
its
own
grounds
that
would
be
considerably
worse
than
five
to
three
so
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
patrons
would
have
to
take
their
chances
in
the
future
as
they
have
in
the
past
james
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
to
alternate
in
case
of
a
tie
as
a
team
able
to
tie
its
opponent
on
a
hostile
field
would
be
entitled
to
consideration
for
this
performance
i
am
very
certain
however
that
the
players
of
both
clubs
in
the
recent
world
series
were
satisfied
with
an
arrangement
which
minimized
the
amount
of
traveling
they
were
called
upon
to
do
persons
who
had
seen
a
tie
game
terminated
by
rain
would
hardly
be
satisfied
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
as
to
alternating
ball
parks
should
be
applied
strictly
but
only
in
case
the
tie
game
involved
went
nine
innings
or
more
francis
eaton
editor
boston
to
me
the
feasible
thing
to
do
appears
to
be
to
insert
a
clause
in
stipulations
covering
all
short
series
of
a
special
character
such
as
intercity
and
world
series
making
it
compulsory
for
the

to
alternate

would
it

up

where
an
equal
number
of
games
had
been
played
in

in
cases
where

not

it

john

foster
not
for
some
time
has
there
been
such
a
turning
over
of
the
leaves
of
history
in
the
national
league
as
during
and
because
of
this
there
are
many
new
faces
peering
out
of
the
album
there
have
also
been
changes
in
the
minor
circuits
and
one
prominent
change
in
the
american
league
the
death
of
john
brush
removed
from
base
ball
a
dean
of
the
national
league
wise
in
the
lore
of
the
game
a
man
more
of
the
future
than
of
the
present
as
he
always
foresaw
that
which
some
of
his
contemporaries
were
less
alert
in
perceiving
it
meant
no
easy
task
to
be
his
successor
prior
to
the
death
of
brush
there
was
a
great
deal
of
curious
and
some
idle
speculation
as
to
his
ultimate
successor
in
case
of
decease
or
in
the
event
of
his
retirement
because
of
bodily
weariness
one
or
two
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
upon
his
death
andrew
freedman
would
return
to
prominence
in
base
ball
because
he
was
the
real
owner
of
the
new
york
club
once
and
for
all
the
writer
would
like
to
put
the
personal
stamp
of
absolute
denial
on
the
repeated
statements
made
by
certain
individuals
in
new
york
and
chicago
that
andrew
freedman
retained
the
control
of
the
new
york
club
after
john
brush
was
reported
to
have
purchased
it
freedman
retained
nothing
of
the
kind
not
that
brush
objected
to
him
as
a
partner
but
when
brush
purchased
the
stock
he
purchased
the
control
outright
although
he
did
request
freedman
to
hold
a
few
shares
and
not
give
up
his
personal
interest
in
base
ball
for
freedman
had
a
great
liking
for
the
game
in
spite
of
his
stormy
career
the
assertions
that
freedman
was
the
real
owner
and
brush
the
nominal
owner
were
made
with
malicious
intent
of
which
the
writer
has
proof
and
through
a
desire
if
possible
to
combat
the
popularity
and
the
success
of
the
giants
this
digression
has
been
made
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
while
rumor
was
plentiful
as
to
the
future
control
of
the
giants
brush
was
carefully
grooming
a
young
man
his
hempstead
to
take
his
place
to
a
few
it
was
known
that
hempstead
was
acquiring
such
experience
and
information
as
would
be
necessary
to
assume
the
control
of
an
undertaking
which
has
grown
so
big
as
the
organization
of
the
giants
in
new
york
the
business
details
of
the
club
have
quadrupled
and
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
the
man
at
the
head
have
increased
in
proportion
the
giants
as
successful
as
they
have
been
under
the
control
of
john
brush
and
john
mcgraw
the
men
who
have
been
the
executive
heads
in
both
the
business
and
the
playing
departments
of
the
game
are
as
susceptible
to
reverses
as
if
they
were
the
lowliest
club
in
the
organization
it
is
only
by
constant
and
severe
application
that
the
club
affairs
may
be
kept
at
the
best
pitch
hempstead
brings
to
base
ball
the
advantage
of
youth
a
keen
business
sagacity
developed
beyond
his
years
coolness
a
disposition
that
is
sunny
and
not
easily
ruffled
and
a
reputation
for
unvarying
fairness
and
the
highest
type
of
business
and
sport
ideals
quite
a
list
of
qualities
but
they
are
there
if
characteristics
of
that
description
fail
to
maintain
the
high
standard
of
the
new
york
club
then
it
will
be
due
to
the
fact
that
our
standards
of
business
deportment
have
turned
william
locke
is
the
new
president
and
part
owner
of
the
philadelphia
club
he
and
hempstead
are
the
junior
presidents
of
the
league
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
editor
of
the
guide
to
enter
into
any
long
and
fulsome
praise
as
to
william
locke
his
career
speaks
for
itself
and
he
speaks
for
himself
a
young
man
of
the
finest
attributes
he
has
brought
nothing
to
the
mill
of
base
ball
to
grind
except
that
which
was
the
finest
and
the
cleanest
grain
the
writer
has
known
locke
almost
it
seems
from
boyhood
and
esteems
him
for
his
worth
not
only
as
one
who
has
administered
the
affairs
of
base
ball
with
skill
and
intelligence
but
as
one
who
wrote
of
base
ball
with
understanding
and
excellent
taste
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
locke
is
a
newspaper
graduate
into
the
ranks
of
the
great
sport
the
affairs
of
which
fill
a
little
corner
of
the
hearts
of
so
many
of
america
citizens
perhaps
no
young
man
ever
left
a
newspaper
office
to
become
a
base
ball
president
with
more
good
wishes
behind
him
than
william
locke
he
served
his
apprenticeship
as
secretary
of
the
pittsburgh
club
and
he
served
it
well
he
is
a
high
class
delightful
young
man
every
inch
of
him
and
philadelphia
will
soon
become
as
proud
of
him
as
pittsburgh
is
now
still
another
newspaper
writer
has
been
claimed
from
the
desk
by
the
national
league
he
is
herman
nickerson
formerly
sporting
editor
of
the
boston
journal
who
is
now
the
secretary
of
the
boston
national
league
club
nick
is
known
from
one
end
of
the
national
league
circuit
to
the
other
as
one
of
the
most
solid
and
substantial
of
the
writing
force
and
also
as
one
of
the
most
demure
and
modest
in
addition
to
his
great
fund
of
information
on
base
ball
topics
he
is
an
author
and
the
sword
of
bussy
a
book
which
was
published
during
the
winter
is
even
more
clever
than
some
of
the
author
best
base
ball
yarns
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
in
behalf
of
a
man
wedded
to
base
ball
another
change
in
the
national
league
was
the
selection
of
frank
stevens
of
new
york
as
one
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
new
york
national
league
club
this
brings
into
base
ball
one
of
new
york
cleverest
and
brightest
young
business
men
one
who
is
forging
so
rapidly
to
the
front
in
business
circles
in
the
big
metropolis
that
many
an
older
head
goes
to
him
for
advice
stevens
knows
a
lot
about
base
ball
which
is
of
even
greater
importance
in
the
game
and
is
not
afraid
to
swing
any
venture
that
will
put
with
fairness
a
championship
team
into
the
big
city
he
is
a
son
of
harry
stevens
whom
everybody
knows
rich
and
poor
alike
in
the
american
league
the
death
of
thomas
noyes
president
of
the
washington
club
a
young
man
who
left
behind
naught
but
friends
left
a
vacancy
in
the
organization
which
was
filled
by
the
selection
of
benjamin
minor
the
new
president
of
the
club
has
had
practical
experience
in
base
ball
and
perhaps
plenty
of
it
as
almost
everybody
has
had
in
washington
but
he
is
a
wideawake
progressive
and
ambitious
man
who
is
of
just
the
type
to
keep
base
ball
going
now
that
it
has
struck
its
gait
in
the
national
capital
and
the
future
of
the
sport
looks
all
the
brighter
for
his
connection
with
it
the
umpires
the
umpires
are
always
with
us
and
the
umpire
problem
has
been
a
vexation
of
base
ball
since
the
beginning
of
base
ball
time
yet
neither
the
umpires
the
public
the
club
owners
nor
the
league
officials
need
be
discouraged
for
it
was
fully
proved
in
that
umpiring
as
a
fine
art
has
advanced
a
step
nearer
perfection
we
may
well
doubt
that
perfection
in
its
every
quality
shall
ever
be
achieved
but
we
may
all
feel
sanguine
that
it
is
possible
to
realize
better
results
it
is
true
that
some
men
make
better
umpires
than
others
exactly
as
some
men
make
better
ball
players
than
others
but
it
is
also
true
that
if
the
men
who
find
it
the
hardest
task
to
become
the
most
expert
umpires
would
be
given
a
little
more
encouragement
they
might
be
a
little
more
successful
to
the
staff
of
umpires
of
the
national
league
and
the
american
league
it
is
but
fair
to
render
a
compliment
for
their
work
of
last
season
some
of
them
made
mistakes
but
the
general
average
of
work
on
the
part
of
the
judges
of
play
was
excellent
there
was
less
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
umpires
to
render
their
decisions
without
being
in
a
position
to
follow
the
play
correctly
they
were
occasionally
willing
to
concede
that
they
might
have
been
wrong
when
an
analysis
of
the
play
was
brought
to
their
attention
and
they
were
firm
in
asserting
discipline
without
becoming
overheated
on
their
own
account
to
the
mind
of
the
editor
of
the
guide
in
the
general
light
of
observation
the
most
serious
blunders
committed
by
the
umpires
in
were
in
making
decisions
before
the
play
took
place
this
did
happen
and
more
than
once
to
illustrate
by
an
example
the
editor
of
the
guide
had
exhibited
to
him
some
photographs
taken
during
in
which
a
player
had
been
waved
out
before
he
actually
had
arrived
at
the
base
granting
the
desire
of
the
umpires
to
be
alert
and
ready
to
render
decisions
promptly
it
is
equally
apparent
that
giving
decisions
in
advance
of
the
completion
of
plays
is
likely
to
imbue
the
spectators
with
an
idea
that
the
umpire
is
either
partisan
or
incompetent
young
umpires
in
their
haste
to
make
good
in
the
major
leagues
are
apt
to
overdo
rather
than
fail
to
be
on
time
while
it
is
not
a
pleasant
subject
to
discuss
it
is
a
fact
that
some
umpires
had
been
accustomed
to
use
the
very
language
to
players
on
the
field
that
they
were
presumed
in
their
official
capacity
as
umpires
to
correct
the
writer
knows
of
instances
where
this
took
place
it
has
ever
been
the
policy
of
the
guide
to
stand
for
clean
and
high
class
base
ball
twenty
per
cent
more
women
attend
ball
games
now
than
did
ten
years
ago
eighty
per
cent
more
women
spectators
are
likely
to
attend
five
years
from
now
to
encourage
their
attendance
every
effort
should
be
made
to
eliminate
all
disgraceful
conversation
on
the
field
wherever
it
may
be
ascertained
that
an
umpire
has
used
profane
or
vulgar
language
on
the
field
the
editor
of
the
guide
believes
that
he
should
be
fined
and
punished
as
sternly
as
an
offending
player
it
is
contended
that
the
position
of
the
umpire
has
been
rendered
more
arduous
by
reason
of
the
world
series
the
argument
is
advanced
that
the
players
are
more
intractable
by
reason
of
their
eagerness
to
play
in
the
games
that
argument
would
be
stronger
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
some
of
the
worst
disturbances
emanate
from
the
players
of
the
clubs
that
have
no
chance
to
play
in
the
world
series
as
a
general
rule
two
good
reasons
may
be
advanced
for
disputes
on
the
part
of
players
first
desire
to
cover
up
the
player
own
blunder
second
general
cussedness
there
are
players
who
make
honest
objection
on
the
excitement
of
the
moment
from
sheer
desire
to
win
but
their
lapses
from
base
ball
etiquette
are
so
few
and
far
between
that
their
transgressions
usually
may
be
forgiven
with
some
grace
the
editor
of
the
guide
would
offer
one
suggestion
to
league
presidents
and
umpires
it
is
this
whenever
two
possible
plays
occur
in
conjunction
instruct
the
chief
umpire
always
to
turn
to
the
spectators
and
inform
them
which
player
is
out
for
instance
if
a
player
is
at
bat
and
another
on
the
bases
and
two
are
out
and
an
attempt
is
made
to
steal
second
as
the
chief
umpire
calls
the
batter
out
on
strikes
the
public
should
be
clearly
informed
that
the
batter
is
out
if
the
play
looks
close
at
second
base
the
crowd
frequently
believes
the
runner
has
been
called
out
and
resents
it
accordingly
in
line
with
the
same
play
when
the
runner
is
called
out
and
the
fourth
ball
at
the
same
time
is
called
on
the
batter
the
chief
umpire
should
turn
to
the
spectators
and
to
the
press
box
and
make
it
clearly
understood
that
the
batter
has
been
given
a
base
on
balls
it
saves
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
and
fault
finding
by
the
way
although
it
has
been
said
elsewhere
the
editor
of
the
guide
would
beg
the
indulgence
of
repetition
by
stating
that
the
work
of
the
umpires
during
the
world
series
of
was
one
of
the
finest
exhibitions
of
its
kind
ever
seen
on
a
ball
field
and
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
the
players
would
they
but
deport
themselves
during
all
series
as
they
did
during
the
world
series
might
find
that
there
are
more
good
umpires
in
the
world
after
all
than
bad
ones
base
ball
writers
of
the
south
while
the
base
ball
writers
of
the
cities
which
comprise
the
southern
association
have
no
organized
membership
similar
to
the
base
ball
writers
association
of
the
major
leagues
and
the
organizations
which
are
best
known
as
the
class
aa
leagues
they
are
a
clever
group
of
young
men
who
have
labored
in
season
and
out
of
season
not
only
to
build
up
base
ball
but
to
build
it
up
on
the
right
lines
experience
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
most
abundantly
proved
that
the
standard
of
base
ball
has
steadily
been
elevated
it
needs
no
compilation
of
fact
nor
any
dogmatic
assertion
on
the
part
of
the
editor
of
the
guide
to
attest
that
fact
it
is
a
present
condition
which
speaks
for
itself
the
general
tone
of
the
players
is
far
higher
than
it
was
and
there
has
come
into
evidence
a
marked
improvement
in
the
spirit
of
the
men
who
own
base
ball
clubs
in
the
earlier
history
of
the
sport
there
was
a
tendency
to
win
by
any
means
that
did
not
actually
cross
the
line
of
dishonesty
later
there
came
a
season
when
the
commercial
end
of
the
game
tended
to
encroach
upon
the
limits
of
the
pastime
this
has
been
repressed
in
the
last
two
seasons
and
the
morale
of
base
ball
is
of
a
higher
type
than
it
ever
has
been
in
the
history
of
the
pastime
it
is
a
high
class
sport
in
the
main
managed
by
high
class
men
for
high
class
purposes
going
through
the
early
stages
of
building
up
a
successful
league
which
by
the
way
is
the
severest
of
all
tasks
and
even
now
at
intervals
confronted
with
changes
in
the
league
circuit
the
southern
writers
have
steadily
been
sowing
the
seeds
of
high
class
base
ball
and
they
have
seen
results
prior
to
this
date
for
base
ball
has
become
popular
and
has
been
handsomely
and
loyally
supported
in
sections
in
which
fifteen
years
ago
it
would
have
been
considered
impossible
to
achieve
such
results
it
is
true
that
business
reverses
and
adverse
conditions
have
had
at
times
their
effect
upon
base
ball
in
the
south
and
possibly
may
produce
similar
results
again
but
the
admirable
offset
to
this
fact
is
that
none
of
these
conditions
at
any
time
has
daunted
the
spirit
and
the
resolution
of
the
young
men
who
have
zealously
been
preaching
the
cause
of
clean
and
healthy
base
ball
very
likely
to
their
zeal
their
courage
their
tact
and
their
ability
it
is
possible
to
ascribe
the
increase
in
good
ball
players
which
is
making
itself
manifest
in
the
south
more
high
class
and
attractive
athletes
are
coming
from
the
southern
states
in
these
days
than
ever
was
the
case
before
base
ball
is
very
glad
to
have
them
when
a
representative
major
league
team
is
made
up

has

nearer
an
ideal

a
national

ever
before

pulls

the
object
of
this
hall
of

is
not
necessarily
to
portray
the
very
top
men
of
each
department
of
the
national

for
it
frequently
happens
in
these
days
when
players
take
part
in
only
a
few
innings
now
and
then
that
they
become
entitled
to
mention
in
the
records
although
they
do
not
bear
the
real

national

first
of

daubert
has
earned
his
place
at
first
base
for
the
season
of
threatening
in
other
years
to
become
one
of
the
group
of
leading
players
he
performed
so
well
in
the
season
past
that
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
his
right
there
is
a
new
player
at
second
base
the
regularity
with
which
egan
of
cincinnati
performed
for
the
reds
earned
him
a
place
as
the
banner
second
baseman
at
third
base
the
honor
goes
to
lobert
the
third
baseman
of
the
philadelphia
club
in
this
particular
instance
lobert
was
crowded
not
for
efficiency
but
in
the
number
of
games
played
by
byrne
third
baseman
of
pittsburgh
and
herzog
third
baseman
of
new
york
in
the
matter
of
chances
undertaken
on
the
field
herzog
surpassed
both
lobert
and
byrne
but
in
justice
to
lobert
the
honor
seems
to
be
fairly
deserved
by
him
john
wagner
the
brilliant
veteran
of
the
pittsburgh
club
fought
his
way
to
the
position
of
shortstop
in
his
fielding
was
better
than
that
of
his
rivals
and
at
times
he
played
the
position
as
only
a
man
of
his
sterling
worth
can
play
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
able
secretary
of
the
national
league
john
heydler
has
compiled
two
methods
of
comparing
pitchers
the
hall
of
fame
in
the
national
league
this
year
will
include
two
faces
they
are
those
of
hendrix
of
the
pittsburgh
club
and
tesreau
of
the
new
york
club
the
former
won
the
greater
percentage
of
games
under
the
old
rule
in
vogue
of
allotting
percentage
upon
victories
tesreau
however
under
a
new
rule
which
classifies
pitchers
by
earned
runs
easily
led
the
league
the
editor
of
the
record
is
very
much
inclined
toward
heydler
earned
run
record
in
fact
has
suggested
a
record
based
upon
the
construction
of
making
every
pitcher
responsible
for
runs
and
computing
his
average
upon
the
percentage
of
runs
for
which
he
is
responsible
that
places
tesreau
in
the
front
row
with
mathewson
second
there
are
two
catchers
who
run
a
close
race
for
the
hall
of
fame
in
they
are
meyers
of
new
york
and
gibson
of
pittsburgh
meyers
caught
by
far
the
larger
number
of
games
and
basing
the
work
of
catcher
upon
the
average
chances
per
game
seems
to
lead
his
pittsburgh
rival
both
men
are
sterling
performers
and
meyers
is
an
instance
of
the
greatest
improvement
on
the
part
of
a
catcher
of
any
member
of
the
major
leagues
for
the
position
of
leading
outfielder
all
things
considered
carey
of
pittsburgh
is
selected
for
the
hall
of
fame
not
only
did
he
play
in
the
greatest
number
of
games
of
any
outfielder
but
his
general
work
in
the
outfield
was
sensational
for
the
position
of
leading
batsman
the
hall
of
fame
honors
zimmerman
the
powerful
batter
of
the
chicago
club
his
work
with
the
bat
in
approached
in
many
ways
that
of
the
high
class
and
powerful
batters
of
old
he
batted
steadily
with
the
exception
of
one
very
slight
slump
and
his
work
as
batter
undoubtedly
was
of
tremendous
assistance
to
chicago
zimmerman
did
not
shine
alone
as
the
best
batter
as
he
was
also
the
leading
maker
of
home
runs
and
the
best
hitter
of
the
season
that
gives
him
a
triple
honor
the
best
hitter
of
the
league
was
the
quiet
wilson
of
pittsburgh
though
not
so
high
in
rank
as
a
batsman
as
some
of
his
contemporaries
there
was
none
in
the
organization
who
could
equal
his
ability
to
get
to
third
base
on
long
hits
bescher
as
in
earned
in
the
position
of
leading
base
runner
in
the
national
league
he
stole
more
bases
than
any
other
player
of
the
league
and
was
also
the
best
run
getter
that
is
to
say
scored
more
runs
than
any
other
player

rath
is
a
newcomer
to
the
chicago
club
but
by
all
around
good
work
he
earned
the
place
at

not
so
heavy
a
batter
as
some
of
his
rivals
he
covered
a
great
amount
of
ground
for
the
chicagos
and
steadied
the
infield
throughout
the
year
for
the
position
of
shortstop
mcbride
of
washington
is
the
logical
selection
day
in
and
day
out
he
was
one
of
the
most
reliable
shortstops
in
the
american
league
at
third
base
john
turner
of
the
cleveland
club
retains
the
honor
which
he
earned
for
himself
in
and
he
is
one
of
the
few
players
who
is
a
member
of
the
hall

two
years
in
succession
in
the
outfield
for
all
around
work
the
place
of
honor
goes
to
amos
strunk
the
young
player
of
the
philadelphia
club
he
was
in
center
field
and
in
left
field
and
he
was
a
busy
young
man
for
most
of
the
year
pitching
at
a
standard
higher
than
the
american
league
had
seen
for
years
wood

is
given
the

his
average
of
winning
games
was
very
high
and
he
was
compelled
to
fight
hard
for
many
of
his
victories
the
man
who
caught
him
seems
entitled
to
be
considered

with
which
he
was
identified
up
to
his
death
he
worked
as
a
clerk
in
several
cities
in
the

and
finally
went
to
indianapolis
in
to
open
a
clothing
store
the
store
still
occupies
the
same
building
and
brush
continued
at
the
head
of
the
business
until
his
death
it
was
in
the
early
that
he
first
became
interested
in
base
ball
in
indianapolis
and
he
made
himself
both
wealthy
and
famous
as
a
promoter
in

enlisted
in
the

died
in

career
in
base
ball
a
sport
to
which
he
was
devotedly
attached
and
for
which
he
had
the
highest
ideals
and
aims
began
with
the
indianapolis
club
of
the
national
league
it
has
been
somewhat
inaccurately
stated
that
he
entered
base
ball
by
chance
this
was
not
strictly
speaking
the
case
prior
to
his
first
immediate
association
with
the
national
game
he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
sport
although
not
connected
with
it
in
any
capacity
as
owner
he
was
what
might
be
called
with
accurate
description
a
base
ball
fan
in
the
earlier
stages
of
development
an
opportunity
presented
itself
by
which
it
was
possible
to
procure
for
the
city
of
indianapolis
a
franchise
in
the
national
league
brush
was
quick
to
perceive
the
advantages
which
this
might
have
in
an
advertising
way
for
the
city
with
which
he
had
cast
his
lot
and
subscribed
to
the
stock
like
many
such
adventures
in
the
early
history
of
the
sport
there
came
a
time
when
the
cares
and
the
duties
of
the
club
had
to
be
assumed
by
a
single
individual
and
it
was
then
that
he
became
actively
identified
as
a
managing
owner
as
the
duty
of
caring
for
the
club
fell
upon
his
shoulders
from
that
date
until
the
date
of
his
death
he
was
actively
interested
in
every
detail
relating
to
base
ball
which
might
pertain
to
the
advancement
of
the
sport
and
his
principal
effort
in
his
future
participation
in
the
game
was
to
see
that
it
advanced
on
the
lines
of
the
strictest
integrity
and
in
such
a
manner
that
its
foundation
should
be
laid
in
the
rock
of
permanent
success
naturally
this
was
bound
to
bring
him
into
conflict
with
some
who
looked
upon
base
ball
as
an
idle
pastime
in
which
only
the
present
moment
was
to
be
consulted
the
earliest
environment
of
base
ball
was
not
wholly
of
a
substantial
nature
it
was
a
game
intrinsically
good
of
itself
in
which
the
hazards
had
always
been
against
the
weak
there
was
not
that
consideration
of
equity
which
would
have
been
for
its
best
interests
but
this
was
not
entirely
the
fault
of
the
separate
members
of
the
base
ball
body
but
the
result
of
conditions
in
which
those
whose
thought
was
only
for
the
moment
overshadowed
the
best
interests
of
the
pastime
there
was
an
inequity
in
regulations
governing
the
sport
by
which
the
clubs
in
the
smaller
cities
were
forced
against
the
will
of
their
owners
to
be
the
weaker
organizations
and
possibly
this
was
less
due
to
a
desire
upon
the
more
fortunate
and
larger
clubs
to
maintain
such
a
state
of
affairs
than
to
the
fact
that
the
organization
generally
had
expanded
upon
lines
with
little
regard
to
the
future
the
first
general
complaint
arose
from
the
players
who
composed
the
membership
of
the
smaller
clubs
they
demurred
at
the
fact
that
they
were
asked
to
perform
equally
as
well
as
the
players
of
the
clubs
in
the
larger
cities
at
smaller
salaries
not
that
they
did
not
try
to
do
their
best
for
this
they
stoutly
attempted
under
all
conditions
it
was
the
effect
of
a
discrimination
which
was
the
result
of
the
imperfect
regulations
that
existed
relative
to
the
management
of
the
game
this
attitude
of
the
players
resulted
at
length
in
the
formation
of
a
body
known
as
the
brotherhood
to
offset
not
the
brotherhood
but
the
cause
which
led
to
its
formation
brush
devised
the
famous
classification
plan
imperfectly
understood
in
what
it
intended
to
do
for
the
players
it
was
seized
upon
as
a
reason
for
the
revolt
of
the
players
and
the
organization
of
the
brotherhood
league
at
heart
it
was
the
idea
of
brush
so
to
equalize
salaries
that
the
players
of
all
clubs
should
be
reimbursed
in
an
equitable
manner
as
always
had
been
the
case
and
probably
always
is
likely
to
be
the
players
who
received
the
larger
salaries
were
in
no
mood
to
share
with
their
weaker
brothers
any
excess
margin
of
pay
which
they
thought
that
they
had
justly
earned
and
it
was
not
a
difficult
matter
for
them
to
obtain
the
consent
of
players
who
might
really
have
benefited
by
the
plan
to
with
them
on
the
basis
of
comradeship
the
motives
of
brush
were
thoroughly
misconstrued
by
some
and
if
grasped
by
others
they
were
disregarded
because
they
conflicted
with
their
immediate
temporary
prosperity
the
dead
base
ball
organizer
had
looked
further
ahead
than
his
time
his
plan
was
born
under
the
best
of
intentions
but
it
unfortunately
devolved
upon
the
theory
that
players
would
be
willing
to
share
alike
for
their
common
good
later
in
life
through
another
and
unquestionably
even
better
method
he
succeeded
in
bringing
forth
a
plan
which
attained
the
very
end
for
which
he
sought
in
the
but
in
the
second
resort
by
a
far
more
efficacious
method
the
brotherhood
league
came
into
existence
and
rivaled
the
national
league
the
players
of
the
national
league
and
the
american
association
deserted
to
join
the
brotherhood
league
upon
a
platform
that
promised
utopia
in
base
ball
unquestionably
it
was
the
idea
of
the
general
brotherhood
organization
that
the
national
league
would
abandon
the
fight
and
succumb
but
the
national
league
owners
were
built
of
sterner
stuff
they
fought
back
resolutely
and
hard
and
while
for
a
time
they
were
combated
by
a
fickle
opinion
based
upon
sentiment
it
developed
within
two
months
that
the
public
had
learned
thoroughly
the
reasons
for
the
organization
of
the
new
league
and
declined
to
lend
it
that
support
which
had
been
predicted
and
expected
meanwhile
base
ball
had
received
a
setback
greater
than
any
which
had
befallen
the
sport
in
an
organized
sense
from
a
professional
standpoint
the
brotherhood
league
was
a
pronounced
and
emphatic
failure
this
is
not
the
verdict
of
personal
opinion
but
a
record
which
is
indelibly
impressed
upon
base
ball
history
it
was
the
theory
of
the
brotherhood
league
that
it
in
part
should
be
governed
by
representative
players
but
the
players
would
not
be
governed
by
players
discipline
relaxed
teams
did
pretty
much
as
they
pleased
and
the
public
remained
away
from
the
games
it
may
be
added
with
truth
that
the
national
league
games
were
not
much
better
patronized
but
that
was
due
to
the
prevalent
apathy
in
base
ball
affairs
throughout
the
united
states
when
the
brotherhood
league
was
formed
and
withdrew
so
many
players
from
the
national
league
the
latter
organization
undertook
to
strengthen
itself
where
it
could
and
when
brooklyn
and
cincinnati
applied
for
membership
in
the
circuit
both
were
admitted
the
new
york
national
league
club
had
lost
many
of
its
players
and
upon
the
substitution
of
cincinnati
for
indianapolis
in
the
national
league
circuit
procured
from
brush
many
players
of
note
among
them
rusie
glasscock
buckley
bassett
and
denny
relative
to
the
withdrawal
of
indianapolis
from
the
circuit
it
may
be
said
that
brush
flatly
refused
to
give
up
his
club
asserting
stoutly
that
he
was
perfectly
able
to
continue
the
fight
but
when
he
felt
that
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
demanded
that
cincinnati
become
a
member
he
agreed
to
give
up
the
franchise
providing
that
he
be
permitted
to
retain
his
membership
in
the
national
league
and
transfer
such
of
his
players
as
new
york
desired
to
the
latter
city
it
has
been
alleged
that
he
demanded
an
exorbitant
price
from
new
york
for
the
transfer
of
the
players
this
is
untrue
he
asked
the
price
of
his
franchise
the
value
of
his
players
and
the
worth
of
giving
up
a
base
ball
year
in
a
city
in
which
there
was
to
be
no
conflicting
club
and
as
he
had
expressed
full
confidence
in
his
ability
to
make
a
winning
fight
for
the
national
league
it
was
agreed
that
his
rights
to
be
considered
could
not
be
overlooked
to
retain
his
national
league
membership
he
accepted
stock
in
the
new
york
club
toward
the
close
of
the
base
ball
season
the
brotherhood
league
dealt
what
it
believed
to
be
a
death
blow
to
the
national
league
by
the
purchase
of
the
cincinnati
franchise
it
proved
to
be
a
boomerang
for
before
the
first
day
of
january
the
brotherhood
league
had
passed
out
of
existence
the
backers
of
the
organization
tired
of
the
general
conduct
of
the
sport
were
only
too
willing
to
come
to
an
acceptable
agreement
and
retire
spalding
john
brush
frank
de
hass
robison
charles
byrne
and
soden
were
prominent
members
of
the
national
league
to
bringing
this
result
about
of
these
spalding
and
soden
survive
but
have
retired
from
active
participation
in
base
ball
affairs
it
was
through
this
settlement
resulting
upon
the
base
ball
war
that
brush
activities
were
turned
toward
cincinnati
the
national
league
had
a
franchise
in
that
city
but
no
one
to
operate
it
brush
agreed
to
take
up
the
franchise
and
attempt
to
operate
and
rebuild
that
club
that
however
is
a
detail
which
relates
purely
to
the
continuance
of
a
major
league
circuit
the
next
most
noticeable
achievement
in
brush
base
ball
career
and
to
the
mind
of
more
than
one
the
greatest
successful
undertaking
in
the
history
of
the
game
was
a
complete
revolution
in
the
distribution
of
financial
returns
by
his
success
in
effecting
this
brush
brought
about
the
very
purpose
which
he
had
sought
to
attain
by
his
classification
plan
but
the
method
was
better
for
the
instruments
of
this
readjustment
of
conditions
were
the
owners
and
not
the
players
briefly
it
was
the
following
there
was
still
war
in
base
ball
between
the
american
association
and
the
national
league
recognizing
that
the
best
method
to
bring
about
a
cessation
of
this
war
was
to
effect
an
amalgamation
of
the
conflicting
forces
brush
sought
with
the
assistance
of
others
to
weld
both
leagues
into
one
he
was
aided
in
this
task
though
indirectly
because
spalding
was
actively
out
of
base
ball
by
that
gentleman
frank
de
hass
robison
christopher
von
der
abe
and
francis
richter
editor
of
sporting
life
of
philadelphia
the
writer
also
essayed
in
the
task
in
an
advisory
capacity
the
amalgamation
was
brought
about
though
not
without
some
opposition
indeed
much
opposition
it
was
conceded
at
that
time
that
a
league
which
was
the
object
sought
was
cumbersome
and
unwieldy
but
there
was
no
other
plan
of
possible
accomplishment
which
suggested
itself
but
the
principal
consideration
and
the
result
accomplished
in
this
consolidation
of
leagues
was
that
all
gate
receipts
should
be
divided
share
and
share
alike
so
far
as
general
admissions
were
concerned
that
was
the
greatest
and
most
achievement
in
the
history
of
base
ball
prior
to
that
time
the
principle
of
a
fixed
guarantee
for
each
game
played
had
given
each
home
club
a
stupendous
bulk
of
the
sums
paid
by
the
public
toward
the
maintenance
of
the
sport
the
inevitable
outcome
of
such
an
arrangement
was
that
the
clubs
in
the
larger
cities
completely
overshadowed
the
clubs
in
the
smaller
cities
the
teams
in
the
cities
of
less
population
were
expected
to
try
to
place
rival
organizations
on
the
field
that
would
equal
in
playing
strength
those
of
new
york
boston
and
chicago
but
they
were
unable
to
do
so
unless
their
owners
were
willing
to
go
on
year
after
year
with
large
deficits
staring
them
in
the
face
when
brush
and
his
associates
succeeded
in
placing
base
ball
upon
a
plane
of
absolute
fairness
so
far
as
the
proper
distribution
of
the
returns
of
the
sport
could
be
made
between
clubs
base
ball
began
to
prosper
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
its
history
the
owners
of
smaller
clubs
felt
that
they
could
go
forward
and
try
to
rival
their
bigger
fellows
with
equally
strong
combinations
more
than
that
and
which
to
the
ball
player
is
most
important
of
all
it
jumped
the
salaries
of
the
players
in
the
smaller
clubs
until
they
were
on
equal
terms
with
their
fellow
players
in
the
larger
clubs
so
that
brush
helped
to
accomplish
by
this
plan
the
very
aim
which
he
had
at
heart
when
he
proposed
the
classification
plan
a
just
impartial
and
equal
reimbursement
to
every
player
in
the
game
so
far
as
the
finances
of
each
club
would
permit
and
without
that
bane
to
all
players
a
salary
limit
thus
while
it
is
always
probable
that
some
players
may
receive
more
than
others
based
upon
their
preponderance
of
skill
it
is
now
a
fact
that
of
the
major
league
ball
players
of
the
present
day
owe
their
handsome
salaries
to
the
system
which
john
brush
so
earnestly
urged
and
for
which
he
fought
against
odds
which
would
have
daunted
a
man
with
less
fixity
of
purpose
having
brought
forth
this
new
condition
in
base
ball
which
was
so
just
that
its
results
almost
immediately
began
to
make
themselves
manifest
the
owner
of
the
cincinnati
club
devoted
his
time
and
his
energies
to
the
endeavor
to
place
a
championship
club
in
cincinnati
he
never
was
successful
in
that
purpose
although
his
ill
fortune
was
no
greater
than
that
of
his
predecessors
the
time
came
that
brush
learned
that
the
new
york
base
ball
club
could
be
purchased
he
obtained
the
stock
necessary
to
make
him
owner
of
the
new
york
organization
from
andrew
freedman
but
before
he
did
so
another
base
ball
war
had
begun
between
the
national
league
and
the
american
league
a
disagreement
starting
from
the
simplest
of
causes
but
which
like
many
another
such
disagreement
resulted
in
the
most
damaging
of
conditions
to
the
prosperity
of
the
pastime
as
had
been
the
case
in
the
prior
war
brought
about
by
the
organization
of
the
brotherhood
league
brush
fought
staunchly
for
his
rights
prominent
national
league
players
were
taken
by
the
american
league
clubs
and
this
brought
retaliation
at
length
the
national
league
opened
negotiations
to
obtain
certain
american
league
players
and
succeeded
in
doing
so
among
these
were
the
manager
of
the
baltimore
club
john
mcgraw
who
felt
that
he
was
acting
perfectly
within
his
rights
in
joining
the
new
york
national
league
club
directly
upon
his
acceptance
of
the
management
of
the
new
york
club
brush
became
its
owner
and
the
era
of
prosperity
was
inaugurated
in
new
york
which
was
soon
enjoyed
by
every
club
throughout
the
united
states
in
its
first
year
under
the
new
management
the
team
was
not
in
condition
to
make
a
good
fight
but
the
next
year
it
was
ready
and
since
then
has
won
four
national
league
championships
and
one
world
championship
in
the
spring
of
at
the
very
dawn
of
the
national
league
season
the
grand
stand
of
the
new
york
national
league
club
burned
to
the
ground
a
man
less
determined
would
have
been
overcome
by
such
a
blow
nothing
daunted
and
while
the
flames
were
not
yet
quenched
brush
sent
for
engineers
to
devise
plans
for
the
magnificent
stadium
which
bears
his
name
and
which
on
the
polo
grounds
in
new
york
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
the
most
massive
monument
to
professional
base
ball
in
the
world
in
connection
with
this
wonderful
new
edifice
of
steel
and
stone
which
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
new
world
it
is
appropriate
to
add
that
two
world
series
have
been
played
on
the
field
of
the
polo
grounds
since
it
has
been
erected
the
rules
for
these
world
series
were
formulated
and
adopted
upon
the
suggestion
and
by
the
advice
of
brush
and
since
a
regular
series
season
has
been
a
feature
of
base
ball
the
national
game
has
progressed
with
even
greater
strides
than
was
the
case
in
the
past
at
a
meeting
of
the
national
league
the
following
resolutions
were
adopted
the
death
of
john
brush
president
of
the
new
york
national
league
base
ball
club
comes
as
a
sad
blow
to
organized
professional
base
ball
and
particularly
to
us
his
associates
in
the
national
league
as
the
dean
of
organized
professional
base
ball
his
wise
counsel
his
unerring
judgment
his
fighting
qualities
and
withal
his
eminent
fairness
and
integrity
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
national
game
will
be
surely
missed
he
was
a
citizen
of
sterling
worth
of
high
moral
standards
and
of
correct
business
principles
and
his
death
is
not
only
a
grievous
loss
to
us
but
to
the
community
at
large
as
well
be
it
therefore
that
the
members
of
the
national
league
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
in
session
express
their
profound
grief
at
the
loss
of
their
friend
associate
and
counsellor
and
extend
to
the
members
of
his
bereaved
family
their
sincere
sympathy
in
the
great
loss
which
they
have
sustained
by
his
death
be
it
further
that
a
copy
of
these
resolutions
be
spread
on
the
records
of
the
league
in
connection
with
the
death
of
brush
ben
johnson
president
of
the
american
league
said
brush
was
a
power
in
base
ball
he
will
be
missed
as
much
in
the
american
league
as
in
the
national
league
more
than
three
hundred
friends
relatives
business
acquaintances
lodge
brothers
and
base
ball
associates
attended
the
funeral
of
brush
on
friday
november
at
paul
episcopal
church
indianapolis
fifty
or
more
of
brush
base

associates
and
acquaintances
principally
from
the

were

the

was
conducted
by
the

also
were
represented
the

was
given
impressively
the
rev
brown
in
reviewing
the
life
of
brush
spoke
of
him
as
one
of
the
remarkable
men
of
america
who
in
his
youth
gave
no
promise
of
being
in
later
life
a
national
figure
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
brown
said
the
death
of
john
tomlinson
brush
removes
from
our
midst
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
our
generation
his
life
was
that
of
a
typical
american
he
began
in
the
most
unpretentious
manner
and
died
a
figure
of
national
importance
he
went
through
the
civil
war
so
quietly
that
the
fact
was
unknown
to
some
of
his
most
intimate
friends
he
was
mustered
out
with
honor
and
entered
the
business
world
in
indianapolis
his
labors
here
put
him
at
the
forefront
for
sagacity
squareness
honorable
treatment
and
generosity
his
love
of
sport
made
him
a
patron
of
the
national
game
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
he
went
from
manager
of
the
local
team
to
proprietor
of
the
new
york
giants
he
was
a
bismarck
in
plan
and
a
napoleon
in
execution
his
aim
was
and
he
won
place
by
the
consent
of
all
the
recent
spectacular
outpouring
of
people
and
colossal
financial
exhibit
in
the
struggle
for
the
pennant
between
new
york
and
boston
were
but
the
legitimate
outcome
of
his
marvelous
skill
he
was
an
early
member
of
the
masonic
fraternity
he
took
his
blue
lodge
degree
in
his
native
town
and
to
demonstrate
his
attachment
he
never
removed
his
membership
where
he
had
been
raised
to
the
sublime
degree
of
a
master
there
he
wished
to
keep
his
affiliation
always
he
became
a
knight
templar
in
rapier
commandery
and
was
one
of
its
past
eminent
commanders
he
was
a
member
of
the
scottish
rite
bodies
in
the
valley
of

the

series

no
individual
whether
player
manager
owner
critic
or
spectator
who
went
through
the
world
series
of
ever
will
forget
it
there
never
was
another
like
it
years
may
elapse
before
there
shall
be
a
similar
series
and
it
may
be
that
the
next
to
come
will
be
equally
sensational
perhaps
more
so
viewed
from
the
very
strict
standpoint
that
all
base
ball
games
should
be
played
without
mistake
or
blunder
this
world
series
may
be
said
to
have
been
inartistic
but
it
is
only
the
hypercritical
theorist
who
would
take
such
a
view
of
the
series
from
the
lofty
perch
of
the
bleacherite
it
was
a
series
crammed
with
thrills
and
gulps
cheers
and
gasps
pity
and
hysteria
dejection
and
wild
exultation
recrimination
and
adoration
excuse
and
condemnation
and
therefore
it
was
what
may
cheerfully
be
called
ripping
good
base
ball
there
were
plays
on
the
field
which
simply
lifted
the
spectators
out
of
their
seats
in
frenzy
there
were
others
which
caused
them
to
wish
to
sink
through
the
hard
floor
of
the
stand
in
humiliation
there
were
stops
in
which
fielders
seemed
to
stretch
like
india
rubber
and
others
in
which
they
shriveled
like
parchment
which
has
been
dried
there
were
catches
of
fly
balls
which
were
superhuman
and
muffs
of
fly
balls
which
were
superawful
there
were
beautiful
long
hits
which
threatened
to
change
the
outcome
of
games
and
some
of
them
did
there
were
opportunities
for
other
beautiful
long
hits
which
were
not
made
no
ingenuity
of
stage
preparation
no
prearranged
plot
of
man
no
cunningly
devised
theory
of
a
world
series
could
have
originated
a
finale
equal
to
that
of
the
eighth
and
decisive
contest
apparently
on
the
verge
of
losing
the
series
after
the
saturday
game
in
boston
the
giants
had
gamely
fought
their
way
to
a
tie
with
boston
and
it
was
one
of
the
pluckiest
and
gamest
fights
ever
seen
in
a
similar
series
and
just
as
the
golden
apple
seemed
about
to
drop
into
the
hands
of
the
new
york
players
they
missed
it
because
dame
fortune
rudely
jostled
them
aside
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
new
york
players
were
champions
of
the
world
for
nine
and
one
half
innings
for
they
led
boston
when
the
first
half
of
the
extra
inning
of
the
final
game
was
played
within
the
next
six
minutes
they
had
lost
all
the
advantage
which
they
had
gained
it
was
a
combination
of
bad
fielding
and
lack
of
fielding
which
cost
the
new
york
team
its
title
and
if
only
mathewson
had
not
given
yerkes
a
base
on
balls
in
the
tenth
inning
the
game
might
not
have
been
won
even
with
the
fielding
blunders
but
mathewson
was
pitching
with
all
the
desperation
and
the
cunning
which
he
could
muster
to
fool
the
batter
and
failed
to
do
so
such
sudden
and
complete
reversal
on
the
part
of
the
mental
demeanor
of
spectators
was
never
before
seen
on
a
ball
field
in
a
world
series
the
boston
enthusiasts
had
given
up
and
were
willing
to
concede
the
championship
to
new
york
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
there
was
a
muffed
fly
a
wonderful
catch
by
the
same
player
who
muffed
the
ball
snodgrass
a
base
on
balls
to
yerkes
a
missed
chance
to
retire
speaker
easily
on
a
foul
fly
then
a
base
hit
by
speaker
to
right
field
on
which
engel
scored
another
base
on
balls
to
lewis
and
then
the
long
sacrifice
fly
to
right
field
by
gardner
which
sent
yerkes
over
the
plate
with
the
winning
run
before
entering
upon
a
description
of
the
games
it
is
appropriate
to
say
that
the
umpiring
in
this
series
was
as
near
perfection
as
it
could
be
it
was
by
far
the
best
of
any
since
the
series
had
been
inaugurated
the
umpires
were
william
klem
and
charles
rigler
of
the
national
league

innings
will
be
touched
upon
in
which
there
were
men
on
bases
tesreau
pitched
the
opening
game
for
new
york
and
the
first
man
to
bat
for
boston
was
hooper
tesreau
gave
him
a
base
on
balls
the
next
three
batters
were
retired
in
succession
devore
and
doyle
the
first
two
batters
for
new
york
were
retired
and
snodgrass
hit
cleanly
to
center
field
the
first
base
hit
in
the
series
murray
was
given
a
base
on
balls
but
merkle
flied
to
short
in
the
second
inning
the
bostons
started
as
bravely
as
they
had
in
the
first
as
gardner
the
first
batter
was
safe
on
fletcher
fumble
stahl
batted
to
tesreau
and
gardner
was
forced
out
wagner
was
given
a
base
on
balls
after
stahl
had
been
thrown
out
trying
to
steal
second
and
cady
flied
to
murray
the
bostons
started
with
a
man
on
base
in
the
third
wood
was
given
a
base
on
balls
by
tesreau
and
hooper
sacrificed
doyle
threw
yerkes
out
and
speaker
was
given
a
base
on
balls
but
lewis
died
easily
on
a
weak
fly
to
short
in

half
of
this
inning
the
giants
scored
twice
tesreau
first
at
bat
struck
out
devore
was
given
a
base
on
balls
and
doyle
batted
wickedly
to
left
field
for
two
bases
snodgrass
was
fooled
into
striking
out
but
murray
smashed
the
ball
to
center
field
for
a
single
and
sent
two
men
over
the
rubber
murray
was
caught
at
second
trying
to
get
around
the
bases
while
doyle
was
going
home
with
one
out
herzog
hit
safely
in
the
fourth
inning
but
did
not
score
in
the
fifth
with
two
out
doyle
batted
safely
but
failed
to
score
in
the
sixth
the
bostons
made
their
first
runs
on
speaker
triple
to
left
field
and
lewis
out
if
snodgrass
in
making
a
desperate
effort
to
catch
the
fly
had
permitted
the
ball
to
go
to
devore
the
chances
are
that
speaker
hit
would
have
resulted
in
an
out
so
that
new
york
lost
on
the
play
snodgrass
was
safe
in
the
sixth
on
wagner
fumble
but
was
doubled
off
first
when
murray
drove
a
line
hit
straight
to
stahl
the
seventh
was
the
undoing
of
the
giants
with
one
out
wagner
batted
safely
to
center
field
cady
followed
with
another
hit
to
the
same
place
wood
batted
to
doyle
who
made
a
beautiful
stop
but
with
a
double
play
in
hand
was
overbalanced
and
unable
to
complete
it
that
cost
new
york
three
runs
although
it
was
unavoidable
cady
was
forced
out
but
hooper
hit
to
right
field
for
two
bases
sending
wagner
and
wood
home
yerkes
followed
with
a
clean
hit
to
left
field
for
a
base
and
won
the
first
game
for
boston
with
that
hit
in
new
york
half
of
the
inning
with
one
out
meyers
was
hit
by
a
pitched
ball
but
no
damage
was
done
other
than
to
meyers
feelings
in
the
ninth
wagner
batted
crandall
for
a
hit
crandall
having
been
substituted
for
tesreau
in
the
eighth
inning
as
mccormick
had
batted
for
tesreau
in
the
seventh
cady
made
a
sacrifice
but
the
next
two
batters
were
easily
retired
then
began
the
exciting
finish
and
if
the
giants
had
made
but
a
single
more
they
probably
would
have
begun
the
series
with
a
victory
instead
of
a
defeat
with
one
out
merkle
batted
the
ball
over
second
base
for
a
single
and
the
spectators
who
had
started
toward
the
exits
halted
herzog
followed
with
a
slow
low
fly
to
right
field
which
fell
safely
meyers
crashed
into
the
ball
for
a
that
struck
the
wall
in
right
field
and
the
crowd
began
to
believe
that
wood
had
gone
up
in
smoke
the
boston
players
encouraged
him
with
all
their
best
vocal
efforts
and
when
fletcher
came
to
the
plate
wood
was
using
all
the
speed
with
which
he
was
possessed
it
was
evident
that
fletcher
sole
desire
was
to
bat
the
ball
safely
to
right
field
for
if
he
did
so
both
of
the
runners
could
cross
the
plate
and
the
giants
would
win
twice
he
met
the
ball
and
both
times
it
sailed
in
the
right
direction
but
with
no
result
as
it
was
foul
then
he
struck
out
crandall
perhaps
one
of
the
best
pinch
hitters
in
the
major
leagues
also
struck
out
and
the
boston
enthusiasts
who
were
present
fell
back
in
their
chairs
from
sheer
exhaustion
but
when
they
had
recovered
with
their
band
leading
them
marched
across
the
field
and
cheered
mayor
fitzgerald
of
boston

was
present
as
a
spectator
of
the
contest
in
company
with

on

was
acting
behind

plate
this
contest
was
remarkable
more
for
the
misplays
of
the
new
york
players
which
gave
the
bostons
a
chance
to
save
themselves
from
defeat
than
for
any
undue
familiarity
with
the
pitching
of
mathewson
it
was
the
universal
opinion
of
partisans
of
both
teams
that
mathewson
deserved
to
win
because
he
outpitched
his
opponents
the
weather
was
fair
and
the
ground
in
excellent
condition
in
the
first
inning
snodgrass
began
with
a
clean
hit
into
the
left
field
seats
but
neither
doyle
becker
nor
murray
was
able
to
help
him
across
the
plate
a
run
scored
in
that
inning
with
such
a
fine
start
would
probably
have
won
the
game
for
the
giants
in
boston
half
hooper
hit
safely
to

yerkes
batted

muffed

hit
safely
toward

filling
the
bases
lewis
batted
to
herzog
who
made
a
fine
play
on
the
ball
and
caught
hooper
at
the
plate
this
should
have
been
the
third
out
and
would
have
retired
boston
without
a
run
gardner
was
put
out
by
a
combination
play
on
the
part
of
mathewson
doyle
and
merkle
scoring
yerkes
and
stahl
came
through
with
a
hard
line
hit

the
inning
netted

three
runs
which
were

hooper
got
a
hit
in
the
same
inning
but
two
were
out
at
the
time
and
fletcher
easily
threw
out
yerkes
who
was
the
next
batter
in
the
fourth
inning
murray
began
with
a
clean
hit
to
center
field
merkle
fouled
out
to
the
third
baseman
but
herzog
long
fly
to
speaker
was
an
excellent
sacrifice
and
murray
scored
meyers
again
hit
for
a
single
but
was
left
on
the
bases
the
bostons

this
run
back
in

last
half
of

lewis
began
with
a
single
and
got
as
far
as
third
base
but
could
not
score
the
giants
started
bravely
in
the
seventh
when
herzog
hit
the
ball
for
a
base
and
stole
second
there
were
three
chances
to
get
him
home
but
meyers
who
had
been
hitting
collins
hard
failed
to
make
a
single
and
fletcher
and
mathewson
were
both
retired
in
the
eighth
the
new
york
players
made
one
of
the
game
rallies
for
which
they
became
famed
all
through
the
series
and
went
ahead
of
their
rivals
snodgrass
was
the
first
batter
and
lifted
an
easy
fly
to
lewis
the
boston
player
got
directly
under
the
ball
and
made
a
square
muff
of
it
doyle
followed
along
with
a
sharp
hit
to
center
field
for
a
base
and
although
he
was
forced
out
by
becker
the
latter
drove
the
ball
hard
murray
came
through
with
a
long
to
left
center
and
snodgrass
and
becker
scored
that
tied
the
score
and
also
put
an
end
to
work
in
the
box
stahl
took
him
out
and
substituted
hall
merkle
fouled
weakly
to
the
catcher
but
herzog
caught
the
ball
on
the
nose
and
hit
sharp
and
clean
to
center
field
for
two
bases
sending
murray
home
with
the
run
which
put
the
giants
in
the
lead
another
base
hit
would
have
won
for
new
york
but
meyers
perished
on
a
hard
hit
to
wagner
which
was
fielded
to
first
ahead
of
the
batter
unfortunately
for
new
york
with
two
out
in
the
last
half
of
the
inning
lewis
batted
the
ball
to
left
field
for
two
bases
murray
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
it
he
tumbled
backward
over
the
fence
into
the
bleachers
and
for
a
few
moments
there
were
some
who
thought
that
he
had
been
seriously
injured
gardner
followed
with
a
single
to
center
and
stahl
hit
to
right
for
a
base
but
wagner
struck
out
and
the
bostons
were
down
with
only
a
run
in
the
ninth
hall
gave
a
remarkable
exhibition
fletcher
and
mathewson
were
retired
in
succession
then
snodgrass
doyle
and
becker
were
given
bases
on
balls
filling
the
bags
it
seemed
certain
that
a
run
might
score
and
perhaps
one
would
have
scored
had
it
not
been
for
an
excellent
stop
by
wagner
murray
hit
the
ball
at
him
like
a
shot
but
he
got
it
and
retired
becker
at
second
the
giants
took
the
lead
in
the
tenth
and
once
more
it
appeared
as
if
the
game
would
be
theirs
merkle
began
with
a
long
hit
to
center
field
herzog
batted
to
wagner
and
merkle
played
safe
refusing
to
try
to
score
while
the
batter
was
being
put
out
at
first
meyers
was
given
a
base
on
balls
and
shafer
ran
for
him
fletcher
lifted
a
long
fly
to
left
field
and
merkle
scored
from
third
mathewson
could
not
advance
the
runners
and
died
on
an
infield
fly
yerkes
was
the
first
batter
for
the
bostons
and
was
retired
at
first
base
speaker
hit
to
deep
center
field
there
were
some
scorers
who
gave
the
batter
but
three
bases
on
the
hit
insisting
that
wilson
who
was
then
catching
for
new
york
should
have
got
the
throw
to
the
plate
and
retired
the
batter
in
any
event
wilson
missed
the
ball
and
speaker
scored
lewis
followed
with
a
which
would
have
scored
speaker
if
the
latter
had
not
tried
to
run
home
so
wilson
failure
to
retrieve
the
throw
became
more
conspicuous
other
scorers
gave
speaker
a
clean
home
run
and
it
is
not
far
out
of
the
way
to
say
that
he
deserved
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
neither
team
scored
in
the
eleventh
inning
although
snodgrass
was
hit
by
a
pitched
ball
he
was
the
first
batter
he
tried
to
steal
second
but
failed
to
make
it
this
contest
was
conspicuous
because
of
the
wonderfully
good
fielding
of
doyle
and
wagner
the
former
made
two
stops
along
the
right
field
line
which
seemed
to
be
not
far
from
superhuman
wagner
killed
at
least
two
safe
hits
over
second
base
for
new
york
and
both
of
the
plays
were
of
the
greatest

of
the
best
games
of
his
career
and

until
the

inning
by
far
the
most
notable
play
of
the
game
on
the
field
was
made
by
devore
in
the
ninth
inning
when
he
ran
for
more
than
thirty
feet

caught
an
almost
impossible
fly

over

not
dropped
a
throw
to

base
wagner
stole
second
no
attention
being
paid
to
him
and
then

made
his
wonderfully
good
catch
of
hard
drive
and
the

had
won
their
first
game
in
the
series
marquard
outpitched
both
of

the
fourth
game
of

was
played
in

on
the
following
day
for
most
of
the
forenoon
it
looked
as
if
there
would
be
no
game
because
of
rain
toward
noon
it
cleared
up
slightly
and
although
the
ground
was
a
little
soft
it
was
decided
to
play
in
view
of
the
fact
that
so
many
spectators
had
come
a
long
distance
to
witness
the
contest
the
soft
ground
was
in
favor
of
the
boston
players
for
the
ball
was
batted
very
hard
by
new
york
most
of
the
afternoon
but
the
diamond
held
and
the
infielders
were
able
to
get
a
good
grasp
on
grounders
which
would
ordinarily
have
been
very
difficult
to
handle
tesreau
pitched
for
new

and
wood
for

as
was
the
case
in
the
opening
game
of
the
series
hooper
who
batted
with
much
success
on
the
polo
grounds
began
with
a
single
to
center
and
although
yerkes
was
safe
on
meyers
wild
throw
the
giants
got
out
of
a
bad
predicament
handily
because
of
the
excellent
stops
which
were
made
by

hits
by

by

gardner

on
balls
stahl
forced
him
out
at
second
then
stahl
stole
second
to
the
immediate
surprise
of
the
boston
players
and
the
chagrin
of
the
new
york
catcher
wagner
out
at
first
helped
him
along
and
when
cady
pushed
a
weak
single
to

just
out

reach
of

tesreau

followed
with

extraordinarily
good
stop

in

the
verdict
was
general
that

inning

run
lost
the
game
for

the
next
two

and
for
the
remainder
of
the
contest
boston
never
had
a
man
on

base
mathewson
pitching
marvelous
ball
by
far
the
best
game
of
the
series
as
it
should
easily
have
been
a

contest

not

the

more
than
their
opponents
in

inning
of
the
game
the

scored

runs
and
the
contest
was
never
in
doubt
after
that
made
a
costly
balk
in
the
first
inning
and
the
boston
players
generally
seemed
to
be
less
energetic
and

confident
than

been
expected
from
a
team
which
had

one

the
disposition

the

to
blunder
badly
at
vital
moments
were
at

in

simply
overwhelmed

this
contest
more
than
any

they
had
the

players
confused
and
uncertain
cady
did
not
know
whether
to
throw
the
ball
or
hold
it
and
the
general
exhibition
of
speed
on
the

which
was
made
by
new

was
characteristic
of
the
team
dash
in
the
race
for
the
championship
of
the
national
league

a
system
which

attendance
on
the
following
day
before
the
smallest
crowd
of
the
series
the
final
game
was
played
in
boston
many
boston
fans
disgruntled
at
the
manner
in
which
some
of
them
had
been
seated
deliberately
remained
away
the
air
was
cold
and
bleak
and
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
the
enthusiasts
of
boston
had
given
up
the
fight
which
merely
goes
to
show
the
uncertainty
of
base
ball
the
new
york
players
unquestionably
had
the
championship
won
for
nine
and
one
half
innings
of
the
final
game
and
then
by
the
simplest
of
errors
overturned
all
of
the
good
which
they
had
accomplished
in
their
wonderful
rally
of
the
two
days
preceding
after
outplaying
the
bostons
in
a
manner
which
showed
some
thing
of
the
caliber
of
the
teams
when
both
were
going
at
top
speed
the
new
york
team
stopped
short
as
one
wit
dryly
put
it
boston
did
not
win
the
championship
but
new
york
lost
it
mathewson
pitched
for

and

for

until
the
end
of
the
seventh
inning
with
two

for
the

in

snodgrass

and

scored
in
the
fourth
herzog
started
with
a
and
if
the
ground
rule
had
not
been
changed
he
would
have
had
an
easy
triple
and
ultimately
a
run
which
would
have
changed
all
the
outcome
of
the
game
as
it
was
he
did
not
score
in
the
fifth
devore
began
with
a
single
and
was
out
stealing
second
after
doyle
had
flied
out
and
hooper
had
made
the
most
wonderful
catch
of
the
series
reaching
over
the
right
field
fence
to
get
the
ball
with
his
bare
band
snodgrass
singled
and
murray
fouled
out
in
the
sixth
meyers
received
a
base
on
balls
with
two
out
but
did

score
with

out
yerkes
singled
to

field
and
speaker
got
a
base
on
balls
but
no
run
followed
in
the
seventh
mathewson
began
with
a
single
and
was
forced
out
by
devore
who
was
left
on
bases
while
two
batters
were
retired
for
boston
with
one
out
stahl
hit
safely
to
center
field
it
was
a
pop
fly
which
fell
between
three
men
fletcher
murray
and
snodgrass
wagner
was
given
a
base
on
balls
and
cady
was
an
easy
out
henriksen
batting
for
bedient
with
two
strikes
against
him
drove
the
ball
on
a
line
toward
third
base
in
fact
it
hit
third
base
it
bounded
so
far
back
that
stahl
scored
the
tieing
run
of
the
game
no
runs
were
scored
by
either
team
in
the
eighth
or
the
ninth
innings
in
the
tenth
with
one
out
murray
lined
a
double
to
left
field
and
scored
on
merkle
hard
single
over
second
that
put
the
giants
in
the
lead
with
merkle
on
second
herzog
struck
out
and
wood
threw
out
meyers
the
ball
had
been
batted
so
hard
by
meyers
to
wood
that
it
crippled
the
pitcher
hand
and
compelled
him
to
cease
playing
it
was
fortunate
for
boston
that
the
hit
kept
low
so
much
speed
had
been
put
into
it
by
the
stalwart
indian
catcher
that
had
the
ball
got
into
the
outfield
it
would
have
gone
to
the
fence
it
was
the
undoing
of
wood
but
it
really
led
to
the
victory
of
boston
engle
batted
for
wood
in
the
tenth
he
rapped
a
long
fly
to
center
field
which
was
perfectly
played
by
snodgrass
but
the
center
fielder
dropped
the
ball
engle
went
to
second
base
on
top
of
his
simple
muff
snodgrass
made
a
magnificent
catch
of
fly
which
seemed
to
be
good
for
three
bases
mathewson
bent
every
energy
to
strike
out
yerkes
but
the
batter
would
not
go
after
the
wide
curves
which
were
being
served
to
him
by
the
new
york
pitcher
and
finally
was
given
a
base
on
balls
speaker
hit
the
first
ball
pitched
for
an
easy
foul
which
should
have
been
caught
by
merkle
the
ball
dropped
between
merkle
meyers
and
mathewson
as
was
afterward
proved
the
capture
of
this
foul
would
have
saved
the
championship
for
the
giants
speaker
with
another
life
singled
to
right
and
engle
scored
the
tieing
run
the
giants
still
had
a
chance
but
a
feeble
one
for
yerkes
was
on
third
with
but
one
out
gardner
flied
to
devore
the
new
york
outfielder
caught
the
ball
and
made
a
game
effort
to
stop
the
flying
yerkes
at
the
plate
but
failed
to
do
so
and
the
game
was
over
and
the
series
belonged
to
boston
yet
so
keen
had
been
the
struggle
so
great
the
excitement
so
wonderful
the
rally
of
the
new
york
club
after
having
once
given
the
series
away
that
it
was
the
opinion
generally
that
the
defeated
were
as
great
in
defeat
as
the
victors
were
great
in
victory

spurts
of
energy
on
the
part
of
different
clubs
unexpected
ill
fortune
on
the
part
of
others
and
marked
variations
of
form
which
ranged
from
the
leaders
almost
to
the
lowliest
teams
of
the
second
division
injected
spasmodic
moments
of
excited
interest
into
the
national
league
race
for
and
marked
it
by
more
vicissitudes
than
any
of
its
immediate
predecessors
by
careful
analysis
it
is
not
a
difficult
matter
to
ascertain
why
the
new
yorks
won
their
speed
as
a
machine
was
much
superior
to
that
of
any
of
their
opponents
every
factor
of
base
ball
which
can
be
studied
demonstrates
that
fact
they
led
the
national
league
in
batting
and
they
led
it
in
base
running
they
were
keenly
alive
to
the
opportunities
which
were
offered
to
them
to
win
games
indeed
their
fall
from
the
high
standard
which
they
had
set
prior
to
the
fourth
of
july
was
quite
wholly
due
to
the
fact
that
they
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
situations
daily
as
they
had
earlier
in
the
season
and
their
return
to
that
winning
form
later
in
the
season
which
assured
them
of
the
championship
was
equally
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
regained
their
ability
to
make
the
one
run
which
was
necessary
to
win
that
after
all
is
the
vital
essential
of
base
ball
to
earn
the
winning
run
not
by
hook
or
crook
but
to
earn
it
by
excelling
opponents
through
superior
play
in
a
department
where
the
opponents
are
weak
is
the
story
of
capturing
a
pennant
they
were
dangerous
men
to
be
permitted
to
get
on
bases
and
their
dearest
and
most
bitter
enemies
on
the
ball
field
with
marked
candor
confessed
that
such
was
the
case
opposing
leaders
admitted
that
when
two
or
three
of
the
new
york
players
were
started
toward
home
plate
one
or
two
of
them
were
likely
to
cross
the
plate
and
that
too
when
one
run
might
tie
the
score
and
two
runs
might
win
the
game
while
there
were
some
who
were
quite
sanguine
before
the
beginning
of
the
season
that
the
giants
would
win
the
championship
there
were
others
who
were
convinced
that
they
would
have
a
hard
time
to
hold
their
title
and
after
the
season
was
over
both
factions
were
fairly
well
satisfied
with
their
preliminary
forecast
the
runaway
race
which
new
york
made
up
to
the
fourth
of
july
gave
abundant
satisfaction
to
those
who
said
they
would
win
and
the
setback
which
the
team
received
after
the
fourth
of
july
until
the
latter
part
of
august
afforded
solace
to
those
who
were
certain
in
their
own
minds
that
the
new
yorks
would
have
much
trouble
to
repeat
their
victory
of
it
must
not
be
forgotten
too
that
the
new
york
team
had
the
benefit
of
excellent
pitching
throughout
the
year
in
the
new
record
for
pitchers
which
has
been
established
this
season
by
secretary
heydler
of
the
national
league
and
which
in
part
was
the
outcome
of
the
agitation
in
the
guide
for
a
new
method
of
records
in
which
the
various
base
ball
critics
of
the
major
league
cities
so
ably
contributed
their
opinions
tesreau
leads
all
the
pitchers
in
the
matter
of
runs
which
were
earned
from
his
delivery
mathewson
is
second
ames
is
fifth
marquard
seventh
and
wiltse
and
crandall
lower
and
while
both
the
latter
were
hit
freely
in
games
in
which
they
were
occasionally
substituted
for
others
they
pitched
admirably
in
games
which
they
won
on
their
own
account
in
the
opinion
of
the
writer
this
new
method
which
has
been
put
into
usage
by
secretary
heydler
is
far
superior
to
anything
which
has
been
offered
in
years
as
a
valuable
record
of
the
actual
work
of
pitchers
it
holds
the
pitcher
responsible
for
every
run
which
is
made
from
his
delivery
it
does
not
hold
him
responsible
for
any
runs
which
may
have
been
made
after
the
opportunity
has
been
offered
to
retire
the
side
nor
does
it
hold
him
responsible
for
runs
which
are
the
result
of
the
fielding
errors
of
his
fellow
players
on
the
other
hand
if
he
gives
bases
on
balls
if
he
is
batted
for
base
hits
if
he
makes
balks
and
if
he
makes
wild
pitches
he
must
stand
for
his
blunders
and
have
all
such
runs
charged
against
him
as
earned
runs
nothing
proves
more
conclusively
the
strength
of
this
manner
of
compiling
pitchers
records
than
that
rucker
by
the
old
system
dropped
to
place
in
the
list
of
national
league
pitchers
finished
third
in
the
earned
run
computation
showing
that
if
he
had
been
given
proper
support
he
probably
would
have
been
one
of
the
topmost
pitchers
of
the
league
even
on
the
basis
of
percentage
of
games
won
which
is
more
vainglorious
than
absolutely
truthful
the
giants
are
to
be
commended
for
playing
clean
sportsmanlike
base
ball
there
were
less
than
a
half
dozen
instances
in
which
they
came
into
conflict
with
the
umpires
the
president
of
the
national
league
complimented
manager
mcgraw
in
public
upon
the
excellent
conduct
of
his
team
upon
the
field
and
the
players
deserved
the
approbation
of
the
league
chief
executive
the
general
work
of
the
pittsburgh
team
throughout
the
year
was
good
it
must
have
been
good
to
have
enabled
the
players
to
finish
second
in
the
championship
contest
but
the
team
speaking
in
the
broadest
sense
seemed
to
be
just
good
enough
not
to
win
the
championship
as
one
man
dryly
but
graphically
put
it
pittsburgh
makes
me
think
of
a
wedding
cake
without
the
frosting
fred
clarke
manager
of
the
team
adhered
resolutely
to
his
determination
not
to
play
it
was
not
for
the
reason
that
the
impulse
to
play
did
not
seize
upon
him
more
than
once
but
he
had
formed
a
conviction
or
at
least
he
seemed
to
have
formed
one
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
organization
if
the
younger
blood
were
permitted
to
make
the
fight
it
was
the
opinion
of
more
than
one
that
clarke
incorrectly
estimated
his
own
ball
playing
ability
in
other
words
that
he
was
a
better
ball
player
than
he
credited
himself
with
being
as
batters
the
pittsburghs
were
successful
as
fielders
they
were
superior
to
the
team
that
won
the
championship
as
they
were
not
the
equal
of
the
giants
in
brief
fewer
opportunities
were
accepted
to
make
runs
by
a
much
larger
percentage
than
was
the
case
with
the
new
york
club
which
can
easily
be
verified
by
a
careful
study
of
the
scores
of
the
two
teams
as
they
opposed
one
another
and
as
they
played
against
the
other
clubs
of
the
league
it
took
more
driving
power
to
get
the
pittsburgh
players
around
the
bases
than
it
did
those
of
new
york
in
tight
games
where
the
advantage
of
a
single
run
meant
victory
the
greater
speed
of
the
new
york
players
could
actually
be
measured
by
yards
in
the
difference
of
results
naturally
it
was
not
always
easy
for
the
pittsburgh
enthusiasts
to
see
why
a
team
which
assuredly
fielded
better
than
the
champions
and
batted
almost
equally
as
well
could
not
gain
an
advantage
over
its
rivals
but
the
inability
of
pittsburgh
base
ball
patrons
to
comprehend
the
lack
of
success
on
the
part
of
their
team
existed
in
the
fact
that
they
had
but
few
opportunities
comparatively
speaking
to
watch
the
new
york
players
and
found
it
difficult
to
grasp
the
true
import
of
that
one
great
factor
of
speed
which
had
been
so
insistently
demanded
by
the
new
york
manager
of
the
men
who
were
under
his
guidance
pittsburgh
had
an
excellent
pitching
staff
even
better
results
would
have
been
obtained
from
it
if
adams
had
been
in
better
physical
condition
an
ailing
arm
bothered
him
while
he
fell
below
the
standard
of
other
years
one
splendid
young
pitcher
rapidly
developed
in
hendrix
and
robinson
a
with
practically
no
major
league
experience
pushed
his
way
to
a
commanding
position
in
the
work
which
he
did
until
the
giants
made
their
last
visit
to
pittsburgh
in
the
month
of
august
the
western
team
threatened
to
come
through
with
a
finish
which
would
give
them
a
chance
to
swing
into
first
place
during
the
month
of
september
but
the
series
between
new
york
and
pittsburgh
turned
the
scale
against
the
latter
fired
with
the
knowledge
that
they
were
at
the
turning
point
in
the
race
the
new
york
players
battled
desperately
with
their
rivals
on
pittsburgh
home
field
and
won
even
the
pittsburgh
players
were
filled
with
admiration
for
the
foe
whom
they
had
met
and
while
they
were
not
in
the
mood
to
accept
defeat
with
equanimity
they
did
accept
it
graciously
and
congratulated
the
victors
as
they
left
pittsburgh
after
playing
the
last
game
of
the
season
which
had
been
scheduled
between
them
on
forbes
field
first
base
had
long
bothered
clarke
frequent
experiments
had
been
made
to
obtain
a
first
baseman
who
could
play
with
accuracy
on
the
field
and
bat
to
the
standard
of
the
team
generally
clarke
transferred
miller
from
second
base
to
first
and
the
change
worked
well
more
graceful
and
more
accurate
first
basemen
have
been
developed
than
miller
but
in
his
first
year
of
play
at
the
bag
he
steadied
the
team
perceptibly
and
unquestionably
gave
confidence
to
the
other
men
but
making
a
first
baseman
out
of
miller
took
away
a
second
baseman
and
second
base
gave
clarke
more
or
less
concern
all
of
the
season
at
that
pittsburgh
was
not
so
poorly
off
in
second
base
play
as
some
other
of
the
teams
of
the
senior
circuit
two
important
factors
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
chicagos
in
for
a
few
days
they
threatened
to
assume
the
leadership
of
the
national
league
with
the
opportunity
almost
within
their
grasp
the
machine
which
had
been
patched
for
the
moment
fell
to
pieces
and
the
cubs
brought
to
a
climax
in
their
work
by
all
the
personal
magnetism
and
the
driving
power
of
which
chance
was
capable
were
exhausted
by
their
strongest
effort
the
courage
and
the
wish
were
there
but
the
team
lacked
the
playing
strength
to
return
to
the
factors
which
contributed
to
the
club
success
they
were
the
restoration
to
health
of
evers
and
a
complete
change
in
the
manner
of
playing
second
base
added
to
the
consistent
and
powerful
batting
of
zimmerman
the
latter
led
the
league
in
batting
and
repeatedly
pulled
his
club
through
close
contests
by
the
forceful
manner
in
which
he
met
the
ball
with
men
on
bases
a
third
contributing
force
though
less
continuous
was
the
brief
spurt
which
was
made
by
the
chicago
pitchers
in
the
middle
of
the
season
they
were
strongest
at
the
moment
that
the
new
york
team
was
playing
its
poorest
game
and
their
temporary
success
assisted
in
pushing
the
chicagos
somewhat
rapidly
toward
the
top
of
the
league
they
were
not
resourceful
enough
nor
strong
enough
to
maintain
their
average
of
victories
and
finished
the
season
somewhat
as
they
had
begun
the
most
of
chicago
success
began
to
date
from
the
early
part
of
july
when
lavender
pitching
for
the
cubs
won
from
marquard
of
the
giants
who
to
that
time
had
nineteen
successive
victories
to
his
credit
chicago
continued
to
win
and
the
new
york
team
made
a
very
poor
trip
through
the
west
lavender
physical
strength
held
up
well
for
a
month
and
then
it
became
quite
evident
that
he
had
pitched
himself
out
then
was
the
time
that
the
chicagos
could
have
used
to
good
advantage
two
and
certainly
one
steady
and
reliable
pitcher
who
had
been
through
the
fire
of
winning
pennants
and
would
not
be
disturbed
by
the
importance
which
attached
to
games
in
which
his
club
was
for
the
moment
the
in
the
championship
race
chicago
managed
to
hold
its
own
fairly
well
against
the
new
york
team
indeed
the
cubs
beat
the
new
yorks
on
the
series
for
the
season
but
there
were
other
clubs
pittsburgh
louis
and
cincinnati
which
won
from
chicago
when
victories
were
most
needed
by
the
cubs
and
their
hope
to
capture
the
pennant
deserted
them
as
they
were
making
their
last
trip
through
the
east
the
race
was
not
without
its
bright
side
for
chicago
even
if
the
cubs
did
finish
third
for
the
first
time
since
chance
had
been
manager
of
the
organization
it
was
a
welcome
sight
to
see
evers
apparently
in
as
good
form
as
ever
and
zimmerman
so
strong
with
the
bat
that
the
leadership
of
the
batters
finally
returned
to
chicago
after
it
had
been
absent
for
years
cincinnati
under
the
management
of
henry
finished
fourth
in
the
race
it
was
by
no
means
a
weak
showing
for
the
new
manager
in
view
of
the
team
which
he
was
compelled
to
handle
until
the
new
york
club
played
its
first
series
in
cincinnati
which
began
may
the
reds
were
booming
along
at
the
top
of
the
league
apparently
with
no
intention
that
they
might
ever
drop
back
it
was
new
york
that
won
three
out
of
the
five
games
played
and
took
the
lead
in
the
race
and
when
that
happened
cincinnati
never
was
in
front
again
to
the
other
managers
who
had
been
watching
the
work
of
the
cincinnatis
it
was
apparent
that
sooner
or
later
the
break
would
have
to
come
for
the
reason
that
as
the
season
progressed
better
pitching
would
have
to
be
faced
by
the
cincinnati
club
while
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
cincinnati
pitchers
could
do
any
better
than
they
were
doing
the
manager
seemed
to
have
known
this
for
when
the
break
did
come
and
the
reds
began
to
totter
he
said
in
reference
to
their
downfall
that
no
team
could
be
expected
to
win
with
only
ordinary
pitching
to
assist
it
in
this
manner
cincinnati
played
through
the
middle
of
the
season
always
just
a
little
behind
most
of
its
opponents
as
the
latter
days
of
the
year
began
to
dawn
the
reds
began
to
improve
and
not
the
least
of
which
was
in
the
better
work
of
the
pitchers
they
did
well
enough
to
beat
philadelphia
for
fourth
place
and
while
did
not
have
the
satisfaction
of
finding
his
first
year
as
a
manager
generous
enough
to
him
to
make
him
the
for
the
championship
team
he
actually
put
his
club
in
the
first
division
which
is
something
in
which
many
managers
have
failed
and
some
of
them
managers
of
long
experience
misfortune
and
ill
luck
always
attaches
itself
in
a
minor
degree
to
every
team
which
engages
in
a
championship
contest
but
most
assuredly
philadelphia
had
more
of
its
share
of
reverses
through
accidents
to
players
and
illness
than
any
team
of
the
national
league
yet
the
philadelphias
were
courageous
players
from
whom
little
complaint
was
heard
they
took
their
misfortunes
with
what
grace
they
could
and
played
ball
with
what
success
they
could
achieve
whether
they
had
their
best
team
in
the
field
or
their
poorest
strangely
enough
they
played
an
important
part
in
the
results
of
the
race
frequently
they
defeated
the
chicagos
all
too
frequently
for
the
comfort
of
the
chicago
base
ball
enthusiasts
and
when
the
loss
of
a
game
or
two
by
the
philadelphias
to
the
chicagos
might
have
turned
the
race
temporarily
one
way
or
the
other
the
philadelphias
with
decided
conviction
refused
to
lose
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
of
absolute
fairness
in
the
contests
for
championships
in
the
various
leagues
which
comprise
base
ball
in
its
organized
form
the
day
has
passed
when
the
base
ball
enthusiast
permits
his
mind
to
dwell
much
upon
that
sort
of
thing
if
ever
he
did
but
if
it
were
necessary
to
advance
an
argument
as
to
the
integrity
of
the
sport
and
the
high
class
of
the
men
who
are
engaged
in
the
summer
season
in
playing
professional
base
ball
there
could
be
nothing
better
to
prove
that
the
price
of
victory
is
the
one
great
consideration
greater
than
the
fact
of
philadelphia
success
against
a
team
which
was
a
strong
contender
against
that
which
finally
won
the
championship
as
much
as
philadelphia
desired
that
new
york
should
be
beaten
for
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
teams
in
a
ball
playing
way
the
fighting
spirit
and
the
predominant
desire
to
add
to
the
column
of
victories
as
many
games
as
possible
brought
forth
the
best
efforts
of
the
team
of
ill
fortune
against
chicago
and
struck
telling
blows
against
chicago
success
at
the
most
timely
moments
as
a
whole
the
louis
team
did
not
play
as
well
in
as
it
did
in
the
preceding
year
there
was
some
bad
luck
for
louis
as
well
as
philadelphia
the
players
did
not
get
started
as
well
as
they
had
in
the
previous
two
years
their
spring
training
was
more
or
less
disastrous
for
they
were
one
of
the
clubs
to
run
into
the
most
contrary
of
spring
weather
perhaps
the
worst
trouble
which
the
louis
team
had
take
the
season
through
from
beginning
to
finish
was
in
regard
to
the
pitchers
there
were
two
or
three
young
men
on
the
team
who
seemed
at
the
close
of
the
season
of
to
be
likely
to
develop
into
high
class
pitchers
in
they
pitched
well
in
at
intervals
one
day
it
seemed
as
if
they
at
last
had
struck
their
stride
and
the
next
they
faltered
and
their
unsteadiness
gave
their
opponents
the
advantage
which
they
sought
perhaps
if
the
louis
team
had
been
a
little
stronger
to
batting
it
would
have
rated
higher
among
the
organization
of
the
national
league
several
games
were
lost
which
would
have
been
taken
into
camp
by
a
better
display
at
bat
in
fielding
the
team
was
much
stronger
and
the
success
of
the
infield
combined
with
some
excellent
outfield
work
now
and
then
frequently
held
the
team
up
in
close
battles
but
when
the
pitchers
faltered
on
the
path
the
fielders
were
not
able
to
bear
the
force
of
the
attack
for
three
seasons
in
succession
brooklyn
seems
to
have
been
fated
to
start
the
season
with
bad
luck
and
misfortune
the
spring
training
trip
did
not
bring
to
brooklyn
all
that
had
been
expected
owing
to
the
inclement
weather
when
the
team
began
the
season
at
washington
park
a
tremendous
crowd
filled
the
stands
long
before
it
was
time
for
the
game
to
begin
the
spectators
became
unruly
and
swarmed
over
the
field
it
was
impossible
for
the
ground
police
to
do
anything
with
the
excited
enthusiasts
and
at
last
the
city
police
were
asked
to
assist
they
tried
to
clear
the
field
but
only
succeeded
in
driving
the
crowd
from
the
infield
spectators
were
so
thick
in
the
outfield
that
they
crowded
upon
the
bases
and
prevented
the
players
from
doing
their
best
for
that
matter
the
outfielders
could
not
do
much
of
anything
a
ground
rule
of
two
bases
into
the
crowd
was
established
and
the
new
york
players
who
were
the
opponents
of
brooklyn
took
advantage
of
it
to
drive
the
ball
with
all
their
force
trusting
that
it
would
sail
over
the
heads
of
the
fielders
and
drop
into
the
crowd
they
were
so
successful
that
they
made
a
record
for
hits
and
brooklyn
was
overwhelmed
this
unfortunate
beginning
appeared
to
depress
the
brooklyn
team
the
players
recovered
slightly
but
had
barely
got
into
their
stride
again
when
accidents
to
the
men
began
to
happen
some
of
them
became
ill
and
the
manager
was
put
to
his
wits
end
to
get
a
team
on
the
field
which
should
make
a
good
showing
fighting
against
these
odds
brooklyn
made
the
best
record
that
it
could
as
the
season
warmed
into
the
hotter
months
the
infield
had
to
be
rearranged
there
was
disappointment
in
the
playing
of
some
of
the
infielders
it
was
also
necessary
to
reconstruct
the
outfield
unable
to
get
all
of
the
men
whom
he
would
have
desired
the
manager
continued
to
experiment
and
his
experiments
brought
forth
good
fruit
for
unquestionably
the
excellent
work
of
moran
who
played
both
right
field
and
center
field
for
brooklyn
was
a
great
help
to
the
pitchers
by
the
time
that
the
base
ball
playing
year
was
almost
concluded
brooklyn
had
so
far
recovered
that
it
was
able
to
place
a
better
nine
on
the
diamond
than
had
been
the
case
all
of
the
year
boston
never
was
expected
to
be
a
championship
organization
the
material
was
not
there
for
a
championship
organization
but
boston
did
play
better
ball
than
in
and
that
is
to
the
credit
of
players
manager
and
owner
the
club
had
changed
hands
but
the
new
owner
had
not
been
able
to
readjust
all
of
the
positions
to
suit
him
he
put
the
best
nine
possible
in
the
field
with
what
he
had
never
threatening
to
become
a
championship
winning
team
boston
played
steadily
with
what
strength
it
possessed
and
always
a
little
better
than
in
so
that
the
year
could
not
fairly
be
considered
unsuccessful
at
its
finish
going
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
looking
over
the
contest
for
the
national
league
championship
of
it
is
not
uninteresting
indeed
it
is
of
much
interest
to
call
attention
to
the
remarkably
odd
record
which
was
made
by
new
york
to
win
the
pennant
in
that
record
stands
the
story
of
the
fight
with
striking
shifts
from
week
to
week
the
first
game
played
by
the
giants
was
against
brooklyn
as
has
been
related
and
it
was
won
by
new
york
and
that
by
the
way
was
the
game
in
which
marquard
began
his
admirable
record
as
a
pitcher
for
the
season
the
giants
lost
the
next
three
games
two
of
them
were
to
brooklyn
and
one
to
boston
and
the
players
of
the
new
york
team
began
to
wonder
a
little
as
to
what
had
happened
to
them
then
new
york
won
nine
straight
games
from
the
eastern
clubs
being
stopped
finally
by
philadelphia
on
the
polo
grounds
but
that
defeat
did
not
check
them
they
started
on
another
winning
spurt
and
played
throughout
the
west
without
a
defeat
until
they
arrived
in
cincinnati
this
total
of
victories
was
nine
all
of
the
games
on
the
schedule
were
not
played
because
of
inclement
weather
cincinnati
won
twice
from
new
york
and
then
the
giants
turned
the
tables
on
the
reds
who
had
been
leading
the
league
they
threw
them
out
of
the
lead
which
they
never
regained
and
won
another
succession
of
nine
victories
that
made
three
times
consecutively
that
they
had
won
a
total
of
games
in
groups
of
nine
assuredly
an
unusual
result
losing
one
game
they
again
entered
the
winning
class
this
time
they
won
six
games
in
succession
then
they
lost
a
game
after
this
single
defeat
they
won
but
three
games
their
charm
of
games
in
blocks
of
nine
had
deserted
them
they
were
beaten
twice
after
winning
three
and
pittsburgh
was
the
team
then
they
won
another
single
game
and
immediately
after
that
victory
lost
to
brooklyn
but
that
was
the
last
defeat
for
a
long
time
well
into
the
race
with
their
condition
excellent
and
playing
better
ball
than
they
had
played
since
their
wonderful
spurt
of
the
month
of
september
in
they
won
sixteen
games
in
succession
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
july
dawned
hot
and
sultry
the
air
was
thick
and
muggy
and
without
life
the
giants
were
scheduled
to
play
two
games
that
day
with
brooklyn
the
first
in
the
morning
and
the
second
in
the
afternoon
if
they
won
both
of
them
they
would
tie
a
former
record
which
had
been
made
by
the
new
york
team
for
consecutive
victories
perhaps
it
may
have
been
reaction
after
the
long
strain
of
winning
or
it
may
have
been
an
uncommonly
good
streak
of
batting
on
the
part
of
brooklyn
surely
brooklyn
batted
well
enough
as
the
morning
game
went
to
the
latter
team
by
the
score
of
to
in
the
afternoon
brooklyn
again
beat
the
giants
by
the
score
of
to
wiltse
pitched
for
new
york
and
stack
for
brooklyn
the
new
york
team
went
to
chicago
and
won
twice
then
it
lost
the
fourth
game
was
won
from
chicago
and
then
the
giants
lost
two
in
succession
they
won
one
game
and
immediately
after
that
lost
four
in
succession
chicago
began
to
have
visions
of
winning
the
pennant
from
chicago
the
giants
went
to
pittsburgh
stood
firm
in
a
series
of
three
games
winning
two
and
losing
one
their
next
call
was
at
cincinnati
and
beginning
with
that
series
they
got
back
to
form
a
trifle
and
won
five
games
in
succession
returning
home
they
were
beaten
on
the
polo
grounds
three
games
in
succession
by
chicago
after
that
new
york
settled
into
a
winning
stride
again
and
won
six
games
in
succession
pittsburgh
came
to
the
polo
grounds
and
stopped
the
winning
streak
of
the
champions
by
defeating
them
three
times
in
succession
that
was
a
hard
jolt
for
any
team
to
stand
yet
the
giants
rallied
and
won
the
test
game
of
the
pittsburgh
series
it
was
but
a
momentary
pause
for
after
another
victory
louis
beat
new
york
the
giants
won
another
game
and
the
next
day
lost
to
louis
that
finished
the
home
games
for
new
york
and
the
team
started
west
facing
a
desperate
fight
they
lost
the
first
game
to
chicago
won
the
next
and
lost
the
third
going
from
chicago
to
louis
they
won
three
games
in
succession
returning
to
chicago
lost
a
postponed
game
with
the
cubs
from
chicago
their
path
led
them
to
pittsburgh
where
they
lost
the
first
contest
then
they
made
the
stand
of
the
season
when
they
beat
the
pittsburghs
four
games
in
succession
cincinnati
turned
the
tables
on
the
giants
to
the
consternation
of
the
new
york
fans
and
won
twice
when
it
seemed
as
if
the
giants
were
about
to
start
on
a
career
which
would
safely
land
the
championship
the
giants
returned
home
and
beat
brooklyn
in
the
first
game
and
lost
the
second
they
won
the
next
two
and
then
lost
again
the
championship
was
still
in
abeyance
again
they
won
and
then
lost
to
philadelphia
here
came
another
test
in
a
philadelphia
series
at
philadelphia
which
contained
postponed
games
and
once
more
rallying
with
all
their
might
won
four
games
and
lost
the
last
of
this
series
of
five
following
that
they
won
three
games
and
then
lost
to
louis
they
won
three
times
in
succession
and
then
lost
four
games
to
chicago
and
cincinnati
but
all
of
this
time
chicago
was
gradually
falling
away
because
it
was
necessary
that
the
cubs
should
continue
to
win
successive
victories
if
they
were
to
beat
new
york
for
the
championship
the
giants
atoned
for
the
four
defeats
at
the
hands
of
chicago
and
cincinnati
by
winning
the
next
four
games
in
succession
and
while
this
did
not
actually
settle
the
championship
that
is
the
definite
championship
game
had
not
been
played
the
race
was
practically
over
and
all
that
was
left
to
fight
for
in
the
national
league
was
second
place
in
which
chicago
and
pittsburgh
were
most
interested
the
pitching
staff
of
the
chicagos
had
worn
out
under
the
strain
and
the
cubs
were
beaten

pittsburgh

predictions
in
base
ball
do
not
carry
much
weight
individually
but
when
many
minds
looking
at
the
game
from
different
angles
agree
on
the
main
points
there
usually
is
good
reason
behind
such
near
unanimity
outside
of
boston
it
is
doubtful
if
any
experienced
critic
of
base
ball
in
the
country
expected
the
red
sox
to
be
converted
from
a
second
division
team
into
pennant
winners
in
one
short
season
if
such
expectancy
existed
in
boston
it
was
partially
a
case
of
the
wish
fathering
the
thought
the
majority
of
men
believed
the
machine
with
which
connie
mack
had
achieved
two
league
and
two
world
championships
was
good
for
at
least
one
more
american
league
pennant
that
expectation
was
based
on
the
comparative
youth
of
the
important
cogs
in
the
athletic
machine
yet
this
dope
went
all
wrong
the
athletics
were
beaten
out
by
two
teams
which
were
in
the
second
division
in
one
of
them
as
low
as
seventh
place
the
reason
for
these
form
reversals
were
several
the
boston
and
washington
teams
improved
magically
in
new
hands
while
the
athletics
went
back
a
bit
partly
because
of
too
much
prosperity
and
partly
because
of
adversity
having
come
from
behind
in
and
made
a
winning
from
a
wretched
start
the
mackmen
apparently
thought
they
could
do
it
again
and
delayed
starting
their
fight
until
it
was
too
late
the
loss
of
the
services
of
dan
murphy
for
more
than
half
of
the
season
also
was
a
prime
factor
the
white
sox
were
the
season
sensations
both
ways
and
for
a
time
kept
everybody
guessing
by
their
whirlwind
start
under
new
management
they
walked
over
every
opponent
they
tackled
for
the
first
few
weeks
then
began
to
slip
and
it
required
herculean
efforts
to
keep
them
in
the
first
division
at
the
finish
the
chicago
team
always
was
a
puzzle
to
all
parties
to
the
race
including
itself
from
the
outset
there
was
almost
no
hope
for
the
other
four
teams
in
the
league
cleveland
and
detroit
occasionally
broke
into
the
upper
circles
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
early
weeks
of
the
season
but
not
far
enough
to
rouse
any
false
anticipations
among
their
supporters
louis
and
new
york
quickly
gravitated
to
the
lower
strata
and
remained
there
the
yankees
finally
losing
out
in
their
battle
with
the
browns
to
keep
out
of
last
place
five
american
league
teams
started
the
season
under
new
managers
one
of
the
three
which
began
the
race
under
leaders
retained
from
the
previous
year
changed
horses
in
jake
stahl
harry
wolverton
clark
griffith
harry
davis
and
james
callahan
were
the
new
faces
in
the
managerial
gallery
some
of
them
were
not
exactly
new
to
the
job
but
were
in
new
jobs
of
these
stahl
griffith
and
callahan
proved
successful
leaders
and
the
first
named
became
the
hero
of
a
championship
team
when
the
last
ball
of
the
series
was
caught
davis
resigned
during
the
season
and
was
succeeded
by
joe
birmingham
who
almost
duplicated
the
feat
of
george
stovall
in
putting
new
life
into
the
cleveland
team
and
starting
a
spurt
which
made
the
race
for
position
interesting
wolverton
stuck
the
season
out
in
spite
of
handicaps
that
would
have
discouraged
anybody
then
handed
in
his
resignation
wallace
who
started
the
year
at
the
helm
again
in
louis
cheerfully
handed
over
the
management
to
stovall
who
had
been
transplanted
into
the
mound
city
in
the
hope
of
making
davis
task
easier
in
cleveland
stovall
made
the
browns
a
hard
team
to
beat
and
had
the
mild
satisfaction
of
hoisting
them
out
of
the
cellar
which
they
had
occupied
for
the
better
part
of
three
seasons
an
unpleasant
feature
of
the
season
but
one
which
had
beneficial
results
was
the
strike
of
the
detroit
players
entailing
the
staging
of
a
farcical
game
in
philadelphia
between
the
athletics
and
a
team
of
this
incident
grew
out
of
an
attack
on
a
new
york
spectator
by
ty
cobb
while
in
uniform
and
the
immediate
suspension
of
the
player
for
an
indefinite
period
the
prompt
and
unyielding
stand
taken
by
president
johnson
against
the
action
of
the
detroit
players
and
the
diplomatic
efforts
of
president
navin
of
that
club
averted
serious
or
extended
trouble
and
undoubtedly
furnished
a
warning
against
any
similar
act
in
the
near
future
another
excellent
result
was
the
effort
made
by
club
owners
to
prevent
the
abuse
of
the
right
of
free
speech
by
that
small
element
of
the
patronage
which
finds
its
greatest
joy
in
abusing
the
players
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
it
is
practically
protected
from
personal
injury
in
retaliation
in
the
development
of
new
players
of
note
the
league
enjoyed
an
average
season
and
a
considerable
amount
of
new
blood
was
injected
into
the
game
in
the
persons
of
players
who
made
good
without
attracting
freakish
attention
the
rise
of
the
washington
team
from
seventh
to
second
place
brought
its
youngsters
into
the
limelight
prominently
and
of
these
foster
and
moeller
were
commended
highly
gandil
who
had
his
second
tryout
in
fast
company
plugged
the
hole
at
first
base
which
had
worried
washington
managers
for
some
time
shanks
also
made
a
reputation
for
himself
as
a
fielder
these
men
were
helped
somewhat
by
the
showing
of
their
team
but
the
case
of
gandil
would
have
been
notable
in
any
company
his
first
advent
into
the
majors
with
the
white
sox
showed
him
to
be
an
exceedingly
promising
player
but
for
some
reason
his
work
fell
off
until
he
was
discarded
into
the
international
league
there
he
quickly
recovered
his
stride
and
when
he
did
come
back
shortly
after
the
season
opened
last
spring
he
demonstrated
that
he
had
the
ability
to
hit
consistently
and
proved
a
tower
of
strength
to
griffith
team
baumgardner
of
the
louis
browns
was
an
example
of
a
youngster
making
good
in
spite
of
comparatively
poor
company
his
pitching
record
with
a
team
which
finished
in
seventh
place
stamps
him
as
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
of
the
slab
finds
of
the
year
jean
dubuc
of
detroit
was
another
find
of
rare
value
and
still
another
was
buck
of
boston
but
these
had
the
advantage
over
baumgardner
of
getting
better
support
both
in
the
field
and
at
bat
in
particular
was
fortunate
to
break
in
with
a
championship
team
the
white
sox
introduced
three
youngsters
who
made
good
and
promise
to
keep
on
doing
so
two
of
them
george
weaver
and
morris
rath
started
the
season
with
chicago
and
the
third
baker
borton
joined
the
team
late
in
the
summer
still
later
kay
schalk
started
in
to
make
what
looks
like
a
name
for
himself
as
a
catcher
no
better
illustration
of
the
slight
difference
between
a
pennant
winning
machine
and
a
losing
team
in
the
american
league
has
occurred
recently
than
the
boston
red
sox
furnished
last
year
it
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
team
of
which
compelled
the
use
of
the
nickname
speed
boys
jake
stahl
was
a
member
of
that
team
and
except
for
the
absence
of
stahl
in
the
champions
of
were
composed
of
practically
the
same
men
who
finished
in
the
second
division
only
the
year
before
but
for
the
showing
of
the
whole
credit
for
last
season
transformation
might
be
attributed
to
manager
stahl
much
of
it
unquestionably
is
his
by
right
and
there
is
no
intent
here
to
deprive
him
of
any
of
the
high
honors
he
achieved
to
stahl
arrangement
of
his
infield
probably
is
due
much
of
the
improvement
in
the
team
the
outfield
trio
of
wonderful
performers
did
not
perform
any
more
wonders
last
year
than
in
the
previous
season
but
what
had
been
holes
on
the
infield
were
plugged
tightly
many
looked
askance
when
larry
gardner
supposedly
a
second
baseman
was
assigned
to
third
but
the
results
more
than
justified
the
move
and
it
made
room
at
second
for
yerkes
a
player
who
had
proved
only
mediocre
on
the
other
side
of
the
diamond
this
switch
and
the
return
of
stahl
who
is
a
grand
mark
to
throw
at
on
first
base
gave
the
infield
the
same
dash
and
confidence
as
the
outfield
possessed
and
the
addition
of
some
pitching
strength
in
bedient
and
did
the
rest
it
is
the
ability
to
discover
just
the
right
combination
that
differentiates
the
real
manager
from
the
the
red
sox
were
in
the
race
from
the
start
but
they
were
eclipsed
for
a
time
by
the
white
sox
in
spite
of
that
the
bostonians
never
faltered
but
kept
up
a
mighty
consistent
gait
all
the
way
and
wore
down
all
competitors
before
the
finish
stahl
men
never
were
lower
than
second
place
in
the
race
with
the
exception
of
three
days
early
in
may
when
washington
poked
its
nose
in
front
of
the
red
sox
and
started
after
the
white
sox
only
to
be
driven
back
into
third
place
by
the
men
of
callahan
themselves
for
more
than
a
week
in
april
boston
was
in
the
lead
then
chicago
went
out
and
established
a
lead
so
long
that
it
lasted
until
near
the
middle
of
june
boston
attended
strictly
to
its
knitting
however
without
stopping
in
their
steady
stride
the
red
sox
hung
on
waiting
for
the
callahans
to
slump
when
their
chance
came
in
june
the
bostonians
jumped
into
the
lead
june
was
the
exact
date
and
never
thereafter
did
they
take
any
team
dust
by
the
fourth
of
july
boston
had
a
lead
of
seven
games
over
the
athletics
the
red
sox
kept
right
along
at
their
even
gait
and
a
month
later
were
leading
by
the
same
margin
over
washington
which
had
displaced
the
former
champions
on
september
boston
lead
was
thirteen
games
but
it
was
not
until
september
that
the
american
league
pennant
was
actually
cinched
beyond
the
possibility
of
losing
it
all
season
stahl
men
were
known
as
a
lucky
ball
team
delving
into
the
files
for
the
dope
revealed
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
reports
of
about
every
third
game
they
played
on
the
average
contained
some
reference
to
boston
luck
this
does
not
detract
anything
from
their
glory
no
team
ever
won
a
major
league
pennant
unless
it
was
lucky
no
team
ever
had
as
steady
a
run
of
luck
as
boston
enjoyed
in
unless
that
team
made
a
lot
of
its
own
luck
by
persistently
hammering
away
when
luck
was
against
it
and
keeping
ever
on
the
alert
to
take
advantage
of
an
opening
that
is
the
explanation
of
the
unusual
consistency
that
marked
the
work
of
the
red
sox
all
season
and
the
fact
they
did
not
experience
a
serious
slump
in
the
first
month
of
the
season
they
won
twelve
games
and
lost
eight
the
second
month
of
the
race
was
their
poorest
one
the
nearest
they
came
to
a
slump
in
that
month
they
won
eight
and
lost
ten
games
in
the
third
month
boston
won
and
lost
seven
games
the
fourth
month
saw
them
win
twenty
games
and
lose
eight
and
in
the
fifth
month
their
record
was
twenty
victories
and
five
defeats
in
the
final
stages
of
the
race
the
red
sox
were
not
under
as
strong
pressure
from
behind
and
naturally
did
not
travel
as
fast
after
sighting
the
wire
but
the
figures
produced
explain
why
boston
won
the
pennant
it
started
well
and
kept
going
faster
until
there
was
no
longer
need
for
speed
the
annexation
of
the
world
championship
in
a
record
breaking
series
with
the
new
york
giants
was
a
fitting
climax
to
their
achievement
when
clark
griffith
stalked
through
the
west
on
his
first
invasion
of
the
season
with
a
team
of
youngsters
some
of
them
practically
unknown
and
declared
he
was
going
after
the
pennant
everybody
laughed
or
wanted
to
a
few
weeks
later
everybody
who
had
laughed
was
sorry
and
those
who
only
wanted
to
laugh
were
glad
they
did
for
griffith
kept
his
men
keyed
up
to
the
fighting
pitch
during
the
greater
part
of
the
season
and
when
they
did
start
slumping
in
september
he
made
a
slight
switch
on
his
infield
applied
the
brakes
and
started
them
going
up
again
the
result
was
that
washington
finished
second
for
the
first
time
in
its
major
league
history
winning
that
position
in
the
closing
days
of
the
race
after
a
bitter
tussle
with
the
passing
world
champions
the
acquisition
of
gandil
from
montreal
plugged
a
hole
at
first
base
which
had
defied
the
efforts
of
several
predecessors
to
stop
and
it
helped
make
a
brilliant
infield
for
it
gave
the
youngsters
something
they
were
not
afraid
to
throw
at
in
giving
credit
for
the
work
of
griffith
infield
the
inclination
is
to
overestimate
the
worth
of
the
new
stars
but
there
was
a
tower
of
strength
at
short
in
george
mcbride
who
has
been
playing
steadily
and
consistently
at
that
position
for
several
seasons
without
being
given
the
credit
his
work
has
merited
the
washington
team
at
one
time
or
another
occupied
every
position
in
the
race
except
the
first
and
last
the
senators
were
in
seventh
place
for
a
few
days
in
the
opening
weeks
of
the
season
but
not
anywhere
nearly
as
long
as
they
were
in
second
place
later
on
they
climbed
out
of
the
second
division
by
rapid
stages
and
after
may
they
were
driven
back
into
it
only
once
during
the
rest
of
the
year
that
was
for
three
days
in
the
beginning
of
june
in
the
meantime
they
had
knocked
boston
out
of
second
place
for
a
short
while
in
may
and
most
of
the
way
had
enjoyed
a
close
fight
with
philadelphia
for
third
and
fourth
spots
near
the
middle
of
june
after
the
red
sox
had
ousted
their
white
namesakes
from
first
place
the
senators
also
passed
chicago
and
started
after
boston
but
the
youngsters
were
not
yet
hardened
to
the
strain
and
soon
fell
back
to
third
and
fourth
on
july
washington
went
into
second
place
and
held
onto
it
with
the
exception
of
three
days
for
a
period
of
two
months
september
brought
a
slump
and
griffith
men
surrendered
the
position
to
the
athletics
for
about
two
weeks
then
came
back
and
took
it
away
from
the
mackmen
at
the
end
what
happened
to
the
world
champion
athletics
the
public
did
not
really
know
until
after
the
middle
of
the
season
then
the
suspensions
of
chief
bender
and
rube
oldring
blazoned
the
fact
that
manager
splendid
system
of
handling
a
base
ball
team
by
moral
suasion
had
fallen
down
in
the
face
of
overconfidence
and
too
much
prosperity
few
people
saw
any
reason
for
changing
their
belief
in
the
prowess
of
the
athletics
during
the
first
half
of
the
season
because
they
were
in
as
good
position
most
of
the
time
as
they
had
been
the
year
previous
at
the
same
stage
of
the
race
they
were
expected
to
make
the
same
strong
finish
that
swept
everything
before
it
in
not
until
the
second
half
of
the
season
was
well
under
way
did
the
adherents
of
the
mackmen
give
up
the
battle
philadelphia
sterling
young
infield
seemed
to
stand
up
all
right
all
the
year
but
the
outfield
and
the
slab
staff
gave
connie
mack
sleepless
nights
when
dan
murphy
was
injured
in
chicago
in
june
it
was
discovered
what
he
had
meant
to
the
team
dan
was
what
the
final
punch
is
to
a
boxing
star
his
timely
batting
was
missed
in
knocking
out
opponents
and
the
injury
kept
him
out
all
the
rest
of
the
season
the
strain
which
jack
coombs
gave
his
side
in
the
world
series
of
proved
more
serious
and
lasting
than
was
expected
and
if
eddie
plank
had
not
come
back
into
grand
form
it
would
have
been
a
tougher
season
than
it
was
for
the
athletics
the
mackmen
made
a
bad
beginning
for
champions
and
on
may
were
in
the
second
division
during
all
of
may
and
part
of
june
they
climbed
into
the
first
division
and
fell
out
of
it
with
great
regularity
not
until
near
the
middle
of
june
did
the
athletics
gain
a
strangle
hold
on
the
upper
half
of
the
league
standing
from
that
time
on
they
kept
above
the
mark
and
toward
the
end
of
june
they
met
the
white
sox
coming
back
there
was
a
short
scuffle
during
the
early
part
of
july
among
the
athletics
senators
and
white
sox
for
the
possession
of
the
position
next
to
boston
then
chicago
was
pushed
back
leaving
philadelphia
and
washington
to
fight
it
out
the
rest
of
the
way
trimming
the
phillies
four
out
of
five
games
in
their
city
series
did
not
lessen
the
gloom
of
the
athletics
the
white
sox
by
their
meteoric
career
demonstrated
the
value
of
good
condition
at
the
start
although
the
chicagoans
experienced
tough
weather
in
texas
last
spring
they
fared
better
than
any
of
the
other
teams
in
their
league
and
that
fact
combined
with
the
readiness
with
which
youth
gets
into
playing
trim
enabled
the
white
sox
to
walk
through
the
early
weeks
of
their
schedule
with
an
ease
that
astonished
everybody
even
prophets
who
were
friendly
to
them
had
expected
no
such
showing
so
fast
did
the
callahans
travel
that
on
may
they
had
lost
only
four
games
having
won
thirteen
in
that
time
but
boston
was
hanging
on
persistently
chicago
margin
over
the
red
sox
varied
from
four
to
five
and
a
half
games
during
may
on
the
fourteenth
of
that
month
the
white
sox
had
won
games
and
lost
only
five
giving
them
the
percentage
of
during
part
of
this
time
they
were
on
their
first
invasion
of
the
east
may
saw
the
chicago
men
five
and
a
half
games
in
the
lead
and
their
constituents
were
dreaming
of
another
world
pennant
almost
every
night
even
the
doubters
were
beginning
to
believe
manager
callahan
had
found
the
right
combination
just
then
came
the
awakening
the
luck
which
had
been
coming
their
way
began
breaking
against
them
with
remarkable
persistency
plays
that
had
won
game
after
game
went
wrong
and
youth
was
not
resourceful
enough
to
offset
the
breaks
the
white
sox
began
to
fall
away
fast
in
percentage
but
managed
to
cling
to
the
lead
until
june
boston
passed
them
right
there
and
the
chicagoans
kept
on
going
by
manager
callahan
was
fighting
to
keep
his
men
in
the
first
division
and
their
slump
did
not
end
until
they
landed
in
fifth
place
for
a
couple
of
days
in
august
then
in
desperation
callahan
began
switching
his
and
by
herculean
effort
and
the
help
of
ed
walsh
climbed
back
into
the
upper
quartet
and
stuck
there
to
the
finish
it
was
a
desperate
remedy
to
take
harry
lord
off
third
base
where
he
had
played
during
most
of
his
professional
career
and
try
to
convert
him
into
an
outfielder
a
position
in
which
he
had
had
no
experience
at
all
but
lord
was
too
good
an
offensive
player
to
take
out
of
the
game
in
spite
of
his
slump
at
third
base
and
he
was
willing
to
try
the
outfield
results
justified
the
move
lord
learned
outfielding
rapidly
and
zeider
proved
that
third
base
was
his
natural
position
the
acquisition
of
borton
for
first
base
enabled
callahan
to
put
collins
in
the
outfield
and
the
white
sox
in
reality
were
a
stronger
team
when
they
finished
than
when
they
started
their
runaway
race
in
april
with
one
more
reliable
pitcher
to
take
his
turn
regularly
on
the
slab
all
season
the
white
sox
would
have
kept
in
the
race
callahan
men
made
up
for
some
of
the
disappointment
they
produced
by
beating
the
cubs
in
a
series
after
the
cubs
had
won
three
victories
two
of
the
nine
games
were
drawn
and
one
other
went
into
extra
innings
making
a
more
extended
combat
than
the
world
series
cleveland
experience
was
almost
identical
with
that
of
even
to
swapping
managers
in
harry
davis
for
years
first
lieutenant
to
connie
mack
took
the
management
or
the
naps
under
a
severe
handicap
he
succeeded
a
temporary
manager
george
stovall
who
had
made
good
in
the
latter
half
of
the
previous
season
but
who
could
not
be
retained
without
abrogating
a
previous
agreement
with
davis
the
public
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
situation
when
the
naps
failed
to
get
into
the
fight
and
the
new
management
had
a
pitching
staff
of
youngsters
with
out
much
of
a
catching
staff
to
help
them
out
when
in
trouble
the
cleveland
team
never
was
prominent
in
the
race
after
the
first
fortnight
although
it
retained
a
respectable
position
at
the
top
of
the
second
division
with
an
occasional
journey
into
the
first
division
during
the
first
month
or
six
weeks
in
the
middle
of
june
the
naps
dropped
back
into
sixth
place
below
detroit
for
a
while
then
took
a
brace
and
reclaimed
the
leadership
of
the
second
squad
for
part
of
july
midway
in
august
found
cleveland
apparently
anchored
in
sixth
spot
and
with
the
consent
of
the
cleveland
club
owners
manager
davis
resigned
his
position
the
management
was
given
to
joe
birmingham
who
took
hold
of
it
with
enthusiasm
but
without
experience
just
as
stovall
did
the
previous
year
he
infused
new
life
into
the
team
shook
it
up
a
bit
and
improved
its
playing
so
much
that
cleveland
passed
detroit
before
the
end
of
the
race
and
was
threatening
to
knock
chicago
out
of
fourth
place
at
one
time
this
would
have
happened
but
for
the
brace
of
the
white
sox
profiting
by
previous
experience
the
club
owners
did
not
look
around
for
a
permanent
manager
until
they
saw
what
birmingham
could
do
and
in
consequence
were
in
position
to
offer
him
the
leadership
of
the
naps
for
the
season
of
what
was
left
to
manager
jennings
from
the
great
detroit
team
that
had
won
three
straight
pennants
was
slowing
up
with
the
exception
of
tyrus
cobb
who
has
yet
to
reach
the
meridian
of
his
career
and
the
georgian
got
into
trouble
fairly
early
in
the
season
with
the
result
that
he
was
suspended
for
a
considerable
period
that
and
the
strike
of
the
tigers
in
philadelphia
threw
a
into
the
machinery
resulting
in
a
tangle
which
jennings
was
unable
to
straighten
out
all
the
season
there
was
a
problem
at
first
base
which
he
had
a
hard
time
solving
the
break
in
del
gainor
wrist
the
season
before
had
not
mended
as
it
should
have
done
and
he
was
unable
to
play
the
position
regularly
moriarty
was
pressed
into
service
there
and
did
good
work
in
an
unfamiliar
position
then
the
infield
was
shifted
several
times
without
marked
benefit
donovan
who
had
always
been
of
great
help
on
the
slab
in
hot
weather
was
not
equal
to
the
task
of
another
year
and
was
made
manager
of
the
providence
team
jean
dubuc
was
the
only
one
of
the
young
pitchers
who
proved
a
star
but
his
work
kept
the
tigers
from
being
a
lot
more
disappointing
proposition
than
they
were
louis
and
new
york
were
outclassed
from
the
start
two
weeks
after
the
season
opened
it
was
apparent
they
were
doomed
to
fight
it
out
for
the
last
round
on
the
ladder
that
the
browns
finally
escaped
the
cellar
in
the
closing
days
of
the
race
was
due
largely
to
the
efforts
of
stovall
who
was
made
manager
to
succeed
wallace
near
the
middle
of
the
season
as
early
as
the
first
of
may
it
was
seen
the
browns
and
yankees
were
destined
to
trail
the
new
york
team
quickly
gravitated
to
the
bottom
it
started
without
the
services
of
catcher
eddie
sweeney
who
held
out
for
a
larger
salary
and
it
had
a
manager
at
the
helm
who
was
inexperienced
in
major
league
leadership
not
until
april
did
new
york
win
a
game
and
in
that
time
it
had
lost
seven
straight
postponements
accounting
for
the
rest
of
the
time
louis
got
a
little
better
start
and
for
a
while
was
inclined
to
dispute
sixth
place
with
detroit
but
on
may
the
browns
found
only
new
york
between
them
and
the
basement
in
the
middle
of
may
the
yankees
passed
louis
and
ran
seventh
in
the
race
until
july
but
accident
and
injury
and
the
loss
of
cree
shot
the
yankees
to
pieces
for
nearly
six
weeks
however
it
was
a
battle
royal
between
new
york
and
louis
to
escape
the
last
hole
but
in
the
middle
of
august
the
yankees
again
established
their
superiority
retaining
seventh
place
until
after
the
middle
of
september
in
the
homestretch
the
new
blood
given
stovall
enabled
him
to
pull
his
men
out
of
the
last
notch
just
before
the
schedule
ran
out
this
feat
was
soon
forgotten
in
the
defeat
of
the
browns
by
the
cardinals
in
their
series
for
the
championship
of
the
mound
city
the
year
was
not
prolific
of
freak
or
performances
in
the
american
league
walter
johnson
of
washington
and
joe
wood
of
boston
were
credited
with
sixteen
straight
victories
which
raised
the
american
league
record
in
that
respect
from
fourteen
straight
formerly
held
by
jack
chesbro
of
the
yankees
mullin
of
detroit
and
hamilton
of
louis
added
their
names
to
the
list
of
hurlers
who
have
held
opponents
without
a
safe
hit
in
nine
innings
mullin
performed
his
hitless
feat
