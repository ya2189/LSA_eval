the
the
shining

two
wonderful
gulfs
were
busy
with
fishing
boats
and
little
ships
the
vessels
came
under
their
square
sails
and
were
driven
by
with
great
oars
a
greek
boy
standing
two
thousand
years
ago
on
the
wonderful
mountain
of
the
that
leaps
suddenly
from
the
plain
above
corinth
to
a
pinnacle
over
a
thousand
feet
high
could
see
the
boats
come
sailing
from
the
east
where
they
hailed
from
the
piræus
and
ephesus
and
the
marble
islands
of
the
ægean
sea
turning
round
he
could
watch
them
also
coming
from
the
west
up
the
gulf
of
corinth
from
the
harbours
of
the
gulf
and
even
from
the
adriatic
sea
and
brundusium
in
between
the
two
gulfs
lay
the
isthmus
of
corinth
to
which
the
men
on
the
ships
were
sailing
and
rowing
the
people
were
all
in
holiday
dress
for
the
great
athletic
sports
were
to
be
held
on
that
day
and
the
next
the
sports
that
drew
in
those
ancient
days
over
thirty
thousand
greeks
from
all
the
country
round
from
the
towns
on
the
shores
of
the
two
gulfs
and
from
the
of
greece
from
parnassus
and
helicon
and
delphi
from
athens
and
the
villages
on
the
slopes
of
hymettus
and
even
from
sparta
these
sports
which
were
some
of
the
finest
ever
held
in
the
whole
world
were
called
because
they
were
held
on
this
isthmus
the
isthmian
games
the
athletes
wrestled
they
boxed
with
leather
straps
over
their
knuckles
they
fought
lions
brought
across
the
mediterranean
the
great
sea
as
they
called
it
from
africa
and
tigers
carried
up
the
khyber
pass
across
persia
from
india
they
flung
spears
threw
quoits
and
ran
amid
the
wild
cheering
of
thirty
thousand
throats
the
charioteers
drove
their
frenzied
horses
lathered
with
foam
around
the
roaring
stadium
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
races
has
a
strange
hold
on
the
imagination
it
was
a
this
is
how
it
was
run
men
bearing
torches
stood
in
a
line
at
the
starting
point
each
man
belonged
to
a
separate
team
away
in
the
distance
stood
another
row
of
men
waiting
each
of
these
was
the
comrade
of
one
of
those
men
at
the
starting
point
farther
on
still
out
of
sight
stood
another
row
and
then
another
and
another
at
the
word
go
the
men
at
the
starting
point
leapt
forward
their
torches
burning
they
ran
at
top
speed
towards
the
waiting
men
and
then
gasping
for
breath
each
passed
his
torch
to
his
comrade
in
the
next
row
he
in
turn
seizing
the
flaming
torch
leapt
forward
and
dashed
along
the
course
toward
the
next
relay
who
again
raced
on
and
on
till
at
last
one
man
dashed
past
the
winning
post
with
his
torch
burning
ahead
of
all
the
others
amid
the
applauding
cheers
of
the
multitude
the
greeks
who
were
very
fond
of
this
race
coined
a
proverbial
phrase
from
it
translated
it
runs
let
the
hand
on
the
flame
to
the
others
or
let
those
who
have
the
light
pass
it
on
that
of
is
a
living
picture
of
the
wonderful
of
heroes
who
right
through
the
centuries
have
with
dauntless
courage
and
a
scorn
of
danger
and
difficulty
passed
through
thrilling
adventures
in
order
to
carry
the
light
across
the
continents
and
oceans
of
the
world
the
the
long
race
of
those
who
have
borne
and
still
carry
the
torches
passing
them
on
from
hand
to
hand
runs
before
us
a
little
ship
puts
out
from
seleucia
bearing
a
man
who
had
caught
the
fire
in
a
blinding
blaze
of
light
on
the
road
to
damascus
paul
crosses
the
sea
and
then
threads
his
way
through
the
cities
of
cyprus
and
asia
minor
passes
over
the
blue
ægean
to
answer
the
call
from
macedonia
we
see
the
light
quicken
flicker
and
glow
to
a
steady
blaze
in
centre
after
centre
of
life
till
at
last
the
reaches
his
goal
in
rome
yes
without
cheer
of
sister
or
of
daughter
yes
without
stay
of
father
or
of
son
lone
on
the
land
and
homeless
on
the
water
pass
i
in
patience
till
the
work
be
done
centuries
pass
and
men
of
another
age
taking
the
light
that
paul
had
brought
carry
the
torch
over
apennine
and
alp
through
dense
forests
where
wild
beasts
and
wilder
savages
roam
till
they
cross
the
north
sea
and
the
light
reaches
the
angles
of
britain
on
whose
name
augustine
had
exercised
his
punning
humour
when
he
said
not
angles
but
angels
from
north
and
south
through
columba
and
aidan
wilfred
of
sussex
and
bertha
of
kent
the
light
came
to
britain
is
not
our
life
said
the
aged
seer
to
the
mercian
heathen
king
as
the
missionary
waited
for
permission
to
lead
them
to
christ
like
a
sparrow
that
flies
from
the
darkness
through
the
open
window
into
this
hall
and
flutters
about
in
the
torchlight
for
a
few
moments
to
fly
out
again
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
even
so
we
know
not
whence
our
life
comes
nor
whither
it
goes
this
man
can
tell
us
shall
we
not
receive
his
teaching
so
the
english
through
these
come
into
the
light
the
centuries
pass
by
and
in
the
little
bearing
christian
descendants
of
those
heathen
angles
new
struggles
through
frightful
tempests
to
plant
on
the
american
continent
the
new
england
that
was
indeed
to
become
the
forerunner
of
a
new
world
a
century
and
a
half
passes
and
down
the
estuary
of
the
thames
creeps
another
sailing
ship
the
government
officer
shouts
his
challenge
what
ship
is
that
and
what
is
her
cargo
the
rings
back
the
answer
under
captain
wilson
bearing
missionaries
to
the
south
sea
the
puzzled
official
has
never
heard
of
such
beings
but
the
little
ship
passes
on
and
after
adventures
and
tempests
in
many
seas
at
last
reaches
the
far
pacific
there
the
pass
from
island
to
island
and
the
light
flames
like
a
beacon
fire
across
many
a
blue
lagoon
and
coral
reef
one
after
another
the
great
heroes
sail
out
across
strange
seas
and
penetrate
hidden
continents
each
with
a
torch
in
his
hand
livingstone
the
pathfinder
in
africa
goes
out
as
the
fearless
explorer
the
dauntless
and
resourceful
missionary
faced
by
poisoned
arrows
and
the
guns
of
arabs
and
marched
with
only
his
black
companions
for
thousands
of
miles
through
marsh
and
forest
over
mountain
pass
and
across
river
swamps
in
loneliness
and
hunger
often
with
bleeding
feet
on
and
on
to
the
little
hut
in
old
village
in
ilala
where
he
crossed
the
river
livingstone
is
the
of
our
great
crusade
john
williams
who
in
his
own
words
could
never
be
content
with
the
limits
of
a
single
reef
built
with
his
own
hands
and
almost
without
any
tools
on
a
cannibal
island
the
wonderful
little
ship
messenger
of
in
which
he
sailed
many
thousands
of
miles
from
island
to
island
across
the
pacific
ocean
these
are
only
two
examples
of
the
men
whose
adventures
are
more
thrilling
than
those
of
our
story
books
and
yet
are
absolutely
true
and
we
find
them
in
every
country
and
in
each
of
the
centuries
so
as
we
look
across
the
ages
we
see
the
race
of
pass
the
torch
from
hand
to
hand
in
this
book
the
stories
of
a
few
of
them
are
told
as
yarns
to
boys
and
girls
round
a
every
one
of
the
tales
is
historically
true
and
is
accurate
in
detail
in
that
ancient
greek
the
prize
to
each
winner
was
simply
a
wreath
of
leaves
cut
by
a
priest
with
a
golden
knife
from
trees
in
the
sacred
grove
near
the
sea
the
grove
where
the
temple
of
neptune
the
god
of
the
ocean
stood
it
was
just
a
crown
of
wild
olive
that
would
wither
away
yet
no
man
would
have
changed
it
for
its
weight
in
gold
for
when
the
proud
winner
in
the
race
went
back
to
his
little
city
set
among
the
hills
with
his
already
withering
wreath
all
the
people
would
come
and
hail
him
a
victor
and
wave
ribbons
in
the
air
a
great
sculptor
would
carve
a
statue
of
him
in
imperishable
marble
and
it
would
be
set
up
in
the
city
and
on
the
head
of
the
statue
of
the
young
athlete
was
carved
a
wreath
in
the
great
of
the
world
many
athletes
men
and
women
have
won
great
fame
by
the
speed
and
skill
and
daring
with
which
they
carried
forward
the
torch
and
themselves
dropping
in
their
tracks
have
passed
the
flame
on
to
the
next
runner
paul
francis
penn
livingstone
mackay
florence
nightingale
and
a
host
of
others
and
many
who
have
run
just
as
bravely
and
swiftly
have
won
no
fame
at
all
though
their
work
was
just
as
great
but
the
fame
or
the
forgetting
really
does
not
matter
the
fact
is
that
the
race
is
still
running
has
not
yet
been
whose
team
will
win
that
is
what
matters
the
world
is
the
stadium
teams
of
evil
run
rapidly
and
teams
of
good
too
the
great
heroes
and
heroines
whose
story
is
told
in
this
book
have
run
across
the
centuries
over
the
world
to
us
some
of
them
are
alive
as
heroic
as
those
who
have
gone
but
all
of
them
say
the
same
thing
to
us
of
the
new
world
who
are
coming
after
them
take
the
torch
the
greatest
of
them
all
when
he
came
to
the
very
end
of
his
days
as
he
fell
and
passed
on
the
torch
to
others
said
i
have
run
my
course
but
to
us
who
are
coming
on
as
after
him
he
spoke
in
urgent
words
written
to
the
people
at
corinth
where
the
isthmian
races
were
run
do
you
not
know
that
they
which
run
in
a
race
all
run
but
one
wins
the
prize
so
run
that
ye
may
be
victors

on
the
tawny
stones
of
the
roman
road
on
the
high
plateau
of
asia
minor
one
bright
fresh
morning
they
had
just
come
out
under
the
arched
gateway
through
the
thick
walls
of
the
roman
city
of
the
great
aqueduct
of
stone
that
brought
the
water
to
the
city
from
the
mountains
on
their
right
looked
like
a
string
of
giant
camels
turned
to
stone
of
the
three
men
one
was
little
more
than
a
boy
he
had
the
oval
face
of
his
greek
father
and
the
glossy
dark
hair
of
his
jewish
mother
the
older
men
whose
long
tunics
were
caught
up
under
their
girdles
to
give
their
legs
free
play
in
walking
were
brown
grizzled
sturdy
travellers
they
had
walked
a
hundred
leagues
together
from
the
hot
plains
of
syria
through
the
passes
of
the
taurus
mountains
and
over
the
levels
of
the
high
plateau
their
muscles
were
as
tireless
as
whipcord
their
courage
had
not
quailed
before
robber
or
blizzard
the
night
yells
of
the
hyena
or
the
stones
of
angry
mobs
for
the
youth
this
was
his
first
adventure
out
into
the
glorious
unknown
world
he
was
on
the
open
road
with
the
glow
of
the
sun
on
his
cheek
and
the
sting
of
the
breeze
in
his
face
a
strong
staff
in
his
hand
with
his
wallet
stuffed
with
food
cheese
olives
and
some
flat
slabs
of
bread
and
by
his
side
his
own
great
hero
paul
their
sandals
rang
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
road
which
ran
straight
as
a
strung
bowline
from
the
city
away
to
the
west
the
boy
carried
over
his
shoulder
the
cloak
of
paul
and
carried
that
cloak
as
though
it
had
been
the
royal
purple
garment
of
the
roman
emperor
himself
instead
of
the
worn
faded
cloak
of
a
wandering
the
two
older
men
whose
names
were
paul
the
tarsian
and
silas
had
trudged
six
hundred
miles
their
younger
companion
whose
name
was
fear
god
or
timothy
as
we
say
with
his
greek
fondness
for
perfect
athletic
fitness
of
the
body
proudly
felt
the
taut
wiry
muscles
working
under
his
skin
on
they
walked
for
day
after
day
from
dawn
when
the
sun
rose
behind
them
to
the
hour
when
the
sun
glowed
over
the
hills
in
their
faces
they
turned
northwest
and
at
last
dropped
down
from
the
highlands
of
this
plateau
of
asia
minor
through
a
long
broad
valley
until
they
looked
down
across
the
plain
of
troy
to
the
bluest
sea
in
the
world
timothy
eyes
opened
with
astonishment
as
he
looked
down
on
such
a
city
as
he
had
never
seen
the
great
roman
seaport
of
troy
the
marble
stadium
where
the
chariots
raced
and
the
gladiators
fought
gleamed
in
the
afternoon
light
the
three
companions
could
not
stop
long
to
gaze
they
swung
easily
down
the
and
across
the
plain
into
troy
where
they
took
lodgings
they
had
not
been
in
troy
long
when
they
met
a
doctor
named
luke
we
do
not
know
whether
one
of
them
was
ill
and
the
doctor
helped
him
we
do
not
know
whether
doctor
luke
who
was
a
greek
worshipped
when
he
met
them
æsculapius
the
god
of
healing
of
the
greek
people
the
doctor
did
not
live
in
troy
but
was
himself
a
visitor
i
live
across
the
sea
luke
told
his
three
friends
paul
silas
and
timothy
stretching
his
hand
out
towards
the
north
i
live
he
would
say
proudly
in
the
greatest
city
of
all
macedonia
philippi
it
is
called
after
the
great
ruler
philip
of
macedonia
then
paul
in
his
turn
would
be
sure
to
tell
doctor
luke
what
it
was
that
had
brought
him
across
a
thousand
miles
of
plain
and
mountain
pass
hill
and
valley
to
troy
this
is
how
he
would
tell
the
story
in
such
words
as
he
used
again
and
again
i
used
to
think
he
said
that
i
ought
to
do
many
things
to
oppose
the
name
of
jesus
of
nazareth
i
had
many
of
his
disciples
put
into
prison
and
even
voted
for
their
being
put
to
death
i
became
so
exceedingly
mad
against
them
that
i
even
pursued
them
to
foreign
cities
then
as
i
was
journeying
to
damascus
with
the
authority
of
the
chief
priests
themselves
at
i
saw
on
the
way
a
light
from
the
sky
brighter
than
the
blaze
of
the
sun
shining
round
about
me
and
my
companions
and
as
we
were
all
fallen
on
to
the
road
i
heard
a
voice
saying
to
me
saul
why
do
you
persecute
me
it
is
hard
for
you
to
kick
against
the
goad
and
i
said
are
you
lord
the
answer
came
am
jesus
whom
you
persecute
then
paul
went
on
i
was
not
disobedient
to
the
heavenly
vision
but
i
told
those
in
damascus
and
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judæa
aye
and
the
foreign
nations
also
that
they
should
repent
and
turn
to
god
later
on
said
paul
i
fell
into
a
trance
and
jesus
came
again
to
me
and
said
i
will
send
you
afar
to
the
nations
that
paul
would
say
to
luke
is
why
i
walk
among
perils
in
the
city
in
perils
in
the
wilderness
in
perils
in
the
sea
in
labour
and
work
in
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
to
tell
people
everywhere
of
the
love
of
god
shown
in
jesus
christ
call
to
cross
the
one
night
after
one
of
these
talks
as
paul
was
asleep
in
troy
he
seemed
to
see
a
figure
standing
by
him
surely
it
was
the
of
luke
the
doctor
from
macedonia
holding
out
his
hands
and
pleading
with
paul
saying
come
over
into
macedonia
and
help
us
now
neither
paul
nor
silas
nor
timothy
had
ever
been
across
the
sea
into
the
land
that
we
now
call
europe
but
in
the
morning
when
paul
told
his
companions
about
the
dream
that
he
had
had
they
all
agreed
that
god
had
called
them
to
go
and
deliver
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
to
the
people
in
luke
city
of
philippi
and
in
the
other
cities
of
macedonia
so
they
went
down
into
the
busy
harbour
of
troy
where
the
singing
were
bumping
bales
of
goods
from
the
backs
of
camels
into
the
holds
of
the
ships
and
they
took
a
passage
in
a
little
coasting
ship
she
hove
anchor
and
was
rowed
out
through
the
entrance
between
the
ends
of
the
granite
piers
of
the
harbour
the
seamen
hoisting
the
sails
the
little
ship
went
gaily
out
into
the
ægean
sea
all
day
they
ran
before
the
breeze
and
at
night
anchored
under
the
lee
of
an
island
at
dawn
they
sailed
northward
again
with
a
good
wind
till
they
saw
land
behind
the
coast
on
high
ground
the
columns
of
a
temple
glowed
in
the
sunlight
they
ran
into
a
spacious
bay
and
anchored
in
the
harbour
of
a
new
city
neapolis
as
it
was
called
the
port
of
philippi
landing
from
the
little
ship
paul
silas
timothy
and
luke
climbed
from
the
harbour
by
a
glen
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
then
on
for
three
or
four
hours
of
hard
walking
till
their
sandals
rang
on
the
pavement
under
the
marble
arch
of
the
gate
through
the
wall
of
philippi
and
as
paul
and
his
friends
walked
about
in
the
city
they
talked
with
people
for
instance
with
a
woman
called
lydia
who
also
had
come
across
the
sea
from
asia
minor
where
she
was
born
she
and
her
children
and
slaves
all
became
christians
so
the
men
and
women
of
philippi
soon
began
to
talk
about
these
strange
teachers
from
the
east
one
day
paul
and
silas
met
a
slave
girl
dressed
in
a
flowing
coloured
tunic
she
was
a
who
earned
money
for
her
masters
by
looking
at
people
and
trying
to
see
at
a
glance
what
they
were
like
so
that
she
might
tell
their
fortunes
the
girl
saw
paul
and
silas
going
along
and
she
stopped
and
called
out
loud
so
that
everyone
who
went
by
might
hear
these
men
are
the
slaves
of
the
most
high
god
they
tell
you
the
way
of
salvation
the
people
stood
and
gaped
with
astonishment
and
still
the
girl
called
out
the
same
thing
until
a
crowd
began
to
come
round
then
paul
turned
round
and
with
sternness
in
his
voice
spoke
to
the
evil
spirit
in
the
girl
and
said
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
i
order
you
out
of
her
from
that
day
the
girl
lost
her
power
to
tell
people
fortunes
so
that
the
money
that
used
to
come
to
her
masters
stopped
flowing
they
were
very
angry
and
stirred
up
everybody
to
attack
paul
and
silas
a
mob
collected
and
searched
through
the
streets
until
they
found
them
then
they
clutched
hold
of
their
arms
and
robes
shouting
to
the
prætors
to
the
prætors
the
prætors
were
great
officials
who
sat
in
marble
chairs
in
the
forum
the
central
square
of
the
city
the
masters
of
the
slave
girl
dragged
paul
and
silas
along
at
their
heels
came
the
shouting
mob
and
when
they
came
in
front
of
the
prætors
the
men
cried
out
see
these
fellows
jews
as
they
are
they
are
upsetting
everything
in
the
city
they
tell
people
to
take
up
customs
that
are
against
the
law
for
us
as
romans
to
accept
yes
yes
yelled
the
crowd
flog
them
flog
them
the
prætors
without
asking
paul
or
silas
a
single
question
as
to
whether
this
was
true
or
allowing
them
to
make
any
defence
were
fussily
eager
to
show
their
roman
patriotism
standing
up
they
gave
their
orders
strip
them
flog
them
the
slaves
of
the
prætors
seized
paul
and
silas
and
took
their
robes
from
their
backs
they
were
tied
by
their
hands
to
the
the
crowd
gathered
round
to
see
the
foreigners
thrashed
the
lictors
that
is
the
of
the
prætors
untied
their
bundles
of
rods
then
each
lictor
brought
down
his
rod
with
cruel
strokes
on
paul
and
silas
the
rods
cut
into
the
flesh
and
the
blood
flowed
down
then
their
robes
were
thrown
over
their
shoulders
and
the
two
men
with
their
tortured
backs
bleeding
were
led
into
the
black
darkness
of
the
cell
of
the
city
prison
shackles
were
snapped
on
to
their
arms
and
their
feet
were
clapped
into
stocks
their
bodies
ached
the
other
prisoners
groaned
and
cursed
the
filthy
place
stank
sleep
was
impossible
but
paul
and
silas
did
not
groan
they
sang
the
songs
of
their
own
people
such
as
the
verses
that
paul
had
learned
as
all
jewish
children
did
when
he
was
a
boy
at
school
for
instance
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
therefore
will
we
not
fear
though
the
earth
do
change
and
though
the
mountains
be
moved
in
the
heart
of
the
seas
though
the
waters
thereof
roar
and
be
troubled
though
the
mountains
shake
with
the
swelling
thereof
as
they
sang
there
came
a
noise
as
though
the
mountains
really
were
shaking
the
ground
rocked
the
walls
shook
the
chains
were
loosened
from
the
stones
the
stocks
were
wrenched
apart
their
hands
and
feet
were
free
the
heavy
doors
crashed
open
it
was
an
earthquake
the
jailor
leapt
to
the
entrance
of
the
prison
the
moonlight
shone
on
his
sword
as
he
was
about
to
kill
himself
thinking
his
prisoners
had
escaped
do
not
harm
yourself
shouted
paul
we
are
all
here
torches
torches
yelled
the
jailor
the
jailor
like
all
the
people
of
his
land
believed
that
earthquakes
were
sent
by
god
he
thought
he
was
lost
he
turned
to
paul
and
silas
who
he
knew
were
teachers
about
god
sirs
he
said
falling
in
fear
on
the
ground
what
must
i
do
to
be
saved
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
they
replied
and
you
and
your
household
will
all
be
saved
the
jailor
wife
then
brought
some
oil
and
water
and
the
jailor
washed
the
poor
wounded
backs
of
paul
and
silas
and
rubbed
healing
oil
into
them
the
night
was
now
passing
and
the
sun
began
to
rise
there
was
a
tramp
of
feet
the
lictors
who
had
thrashed
paul
and
silas
marched
to
the
door
of
the
prison
with
an
order
to
free
them
the
jailor
was
delighted
the
prætors
have
sent
to
set
you
free
he
said
come
out
then
and
go
in
peace
he
had
the
greatest
surprise
in
his
life
when
instead
of
going
paul
turned
and
said
no
indeed
the
prætors
flogged
us
in
public
in
the
forum
and
without
a
trial
flogged
roman
citizens
they
threw
us
publicly
into
prison
and
now
they
are
going
to
get
rid
of
us
secretly
let
the
prætors
come
here
themselves
and
take
us
out
surely
it
was
the
boldest
message
ever
sent
to
the
powerful
prætors
but
paul
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
when
the
roman
prætors
heard
the
message
they
knew
that
he
was
right
they
would
be
ruined
if
it
were
reported
at
rome
that
they
had
publicly
flogged
roman
citizens
without
trial
their
prisoner
paul
was
now
their
judge
they
climbed
down
from
their
marble
seats
and
walked
on
foot
to
the
prison
to
plead
with
paul
and
silas
to
leave
the
prison
and
not
to
tell
against
them
what
had
happened
will
you
go
away
from
the
city
they
asked
we
are
afraid
of
other
riots
so
paul
and
silas
consented
but
they
went
to
the
house
where
lydia
lived
the
home
in
which
they
had
been
staying
in
philippi
paul
cheered
up
the
other
christian
folk
lydia
and
luke
and
timothy
and
told
them
how
the
jailor
and
his
wife
and
family
had
all
become
christians
keep
the
work
of
spreading
the
message
here
in
philippi
going
strongly
said
paul
to
luke
and
timothy
be
cheerfully
prepared
for
trouble
and
then
he
and
silas
instead
of
going
back
to
their
own
land
went
out
together
in
the
morning
light
of
the
early
winter
of
away
along
the
western
road
over
the
hills
to
face
perils
in
other
cities
in
order
to
carry
the
good
news
to
the
people
of
the
west
trail
of
the
so
paul
the
dauntless
pioneer
set
his
brave
face
westwards
following
the
long
trail
across
the
roman
empire
the
of
christ
nothing
could
stop
him
not
scourgings
nor
stonings
prison
nor
robbers
blizzards
nor
he
went
on
and
on
till
at
last
as
a
prisoner
in
rome
he
laid
his
head
on
the
block
of
the
executioner
and
was
slain
these
are
the
brave
words
that
we
hear
from
him
as
he
came
near
to
the
end
i
have
fought
a
good
fight
i
have
run
my
course
i
have
kept
the
faith
long
years
afterward
men
who
were
christians
in
rome
carried
the
story
of
the
kingdom
of
jesus
christ
across
europe
to
some
savages
in
the
north
sea
islands
called
britons
paul
handed
the
torch
from
the
near
east
to
the
people
in
rome
they
passed
the
torch
on
to
the
people
of
britain
and
from
britain
many
years
later
men
sailed
to
build
up
the
new
great
nation
in
america
so
the
torch
has
run
from
east
to
west
from
that
day
to
this
and
from
those
people
of
long
ago
to
us
but
we
owe
this
most
of
all
to
paul
the
first
missionary
who
gave
his
life
to
bring
the
good
news
from
the
lands
of
syria
and
judæa
where
our
lord
jesus
christ
lived
and
died
and
rose
again

ii
the
men
of
the
shingle
beach
of
date
born
incidents
and
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
a
man
named
wilfrid
sailed
along
the
south
coast
of
a
great
island
in
the
north
seas
with
him
in
the
ship
were
a
hundred
and
twenty
companions
the
voyage
had
started
well
but
now
the
captain
looked
anxious
as
he
peered
out
under
his
curved
hand
looking
first
south
and
then
north
there
was
danger
in
both
directions
the
breeze
from
the
south
stiffened
to
a
gale
the
mast
creaked
and
strained
as
the
gathering
storm
tore
at
the
mainsail
the
ship
reeled
and
pitched
as
the
spiteful
waves
smote
her
high
bow
and
swept
hissing
and
gurgling
along
the
deck
she
began
to
jib
like
a
horse
and
refused
to
obey
her
rudder
wind
and
current
were
carrying
her
out
of
her
course
in
spite
of
all
the
captain
the
ship
was
being
driven
nearer
to
the
dreaded
low
shingle
beach
of
the
island
that
stretched
along
the
northern
edge
of
the
sea
the
captain
did
not
fear
the
coast
itself
for
it
had
no
rocks
but
the
lines
deepened
on
his
face
as
he
saw
gathering
on
the
shelving
beach
the
wild
men
of
the
island
the
ship
was
being
carried
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
coast
all
on
board
could
now
see
the
men
of
the
shingle
beach
waving
their
spears
and
axes
the
current
and
the
wind
swung
the
ship
still
closer
to
the
shore
and
now
even
above
the
whistle
of
the
gale
in
the
cordage
the
crew
heard
the
wild
whoop
of
the
wreckers
these
men
on
the
beach
were
the
sons
of
pirates
but
they
were
now
cowards
compared
with
their
fathers
for
they
no
longer
lived
by
the
wild
fight
that
had
made
their
fathers
blood
leap
with
the
joy
of
the
battle
they
lived
by
a
crueller
craft
waiting
till
some
such
vessel
as
this
was
swept
ashore
they
would
swoop
down
on
it
harry
and
slay
the
men
carry
the
women
and
children
off
for
slaves
break
up
the
ship
and
take
the
wood
and
stores
for
fire
and
food
they
were
an
extra
swing
of
the
tide
a
great
wave
and
with
a
thud
the
ship
was
aground
stuck
fast
on
the
yielding
sands
with
a
wild
yell
and
with
their
tawny
manes
streaming
in
the
wind
the
wreckers
rushed
down
the
beach
brandishing
their
spears
wilfrid
striding
to
the
side
of
the
ship
raised
his
hand
to
show
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
the
chief
but
the
island
men
rushed
on
like
an
avalanche
and
started
to
storm
the
ship
snatching
up
arms
poles
whatever
they
could
find
the
men
on
board
beat
down
upon
the
heads
of
the
savages
as
they
climbed
up
the
ship
slippery
side
one
man
after
another
sank
wounded
on
the
deck
the
fight
grew
more
obstinate
but
at
last
the
men
of
the
beach
drew
back
up
the
sands
baffled
the
men
of
the
shingle
beach
might
have
given
up
the
battle
had
not
a
fierce
priest
of
their
god
of
war
leapt
on
to
a
mound
of
sand
and
lifting
his
naked
arms
to
the
skies
called
on
the
god
to
destroy
the
men
in
the
ship
the
savages
were
seized
with
a
new
frenzy
and
swept
down
the
beach
again
wilfrid
had
gathered
his
closest
friends
round
him
and
was
quietly
kneeling
on
the
deck
praying
to
his
god
for
deliverance
from
the
enemy
the
fight
became
desperate
again
the
savages
were
driven
back
up
the
beach
once
more
they
rallied
and
came
swooping
down
on
the
ship
but
a
pebble
from
the
sling
of
a
man
on
the
ship
struck
the
savage
priest
on
the
forehead
he
tottered
and
fell
on
the
sand
this
infuriated
the
savages
yet
it
took
the
heart
out
of
these
men
who
had
trusted
in
their
god
of
war
meanwhile
the
tide
had
been
creeping
up
it
swung
in
still
further
and
lifted
the
ship
from
the
sand
the
wind
veered
the
sails
strained
slowly
but
with
gathering
speed
the
ship
stood
out
to
sea
followed
by
howls
of
rage
from
the
men
on
the
beach
some
years
passed
by
yet
wilfrid
in
all
his
travels
had
never
forgotten
the
men
of
the
beach
and
strangely
enough
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
them
at
last
the
time
came
when
he
could
do
so
this
time
he
did
not
visit
them
by
sea
after
he
had
preached
among
the
people
in
a
distant
part
of
the
same
great
island
wilfrid
with
four
faithful
companions
eappa
padda
burghelm
and
oiddi
walked
down
to
the
south
coast
of
the
island
as
he
came
to
the
tribe
he
found
many
of
them
gathered
on
the
beach
as
before
but
the
fierceness
was
gone
they
tottered
with
weakness
as
they
walked
the
very
bones
seemed
ready
to
come
through
their
skin
they
were
starving
with
hunger
and
thirst
from
a
long
drought
when
no
grain
or
food
of
any
kind
would
grow
and
now
they
were
gathered
on
the
shore
and
a
long
row
of
them
linked
hand
in
hand
would
rush
down
the
very
beach
upon
which
they
had
attacked
wilfrid
and
would
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
to
get
out
of
the
awful
agonies
of
their
hunger
are
there
not
fish
in
the
sea
for
food
asked
wilfrid
yes
but
we
can
not
catch
them
they
answered
wilfrid
showed
the
wondering
men
of
the
shingle
beach
how
to
make
large
nets
and
then
launched
out
in
the
little
boats
that
they
owned
and
let
the
nets
down
for
hour
after
hour
wilfrid
and
his
companions
fished
while
the
savages
watched
them
from
the
beach
with
hungry
eyes
as
the
fish
were
drawn
gleaming
and
struggling
into
the
boats
at
last
as
evening
drew
on
the
nets
were
drawn
in
for
the
last
time
and
wilfrid
came
back
to
the
beach
with
hundreds
of
fish
in
the
boats
with
eager
joy
the
men
of
the
beach
lit
fires
and
cooked
the
fish
their
hunger
was
stayed
the
rain
for
which
wilfrid
prayed
came
they
were
happy
once
more
then
wilfrid
gathered
them
all
around
him
on
the
beach
and
said
words
like
these
you
men
tried
to
kill
me
and
my
friends
on
this
beach
years
ago
trusting
in
your
god
of
war
you
there
is
no
god
of
war
there
is
but
one
god
a
god
not
of
war
but
of
love
who
sent
his
only
son
to
tell
about
his
love
that
son
jesus
christ
who
fed
the
hungry
multitudes
by
the
side
of
the
sea
with
fish
sent
me
to
you
to
show
love
to
you
feeding
you
with
fish
from
the
sea
and
feeding
you
with
his
love
which
is
the
bread
of
life
the
wondering
savages
spear
in
hand
shook
their
matted
hair
and
could
not
take
it
in
at
once
yet
they
and
their
boys
and
girls
had
already
learned
to
trust
wilfrid
and
soon
began
to
love
the
god
of
whom
he
spoke
now
those
savages
were
the
great
great
great
grandfathers
and
mothers
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
the
north
sea
island
was
britain
the
beach
was
at
selsey
near
chichester
on
the
south
coast
and
the
very
fact
that
you
and
i
are
alive
the
shelter
of
our
homes
the
fact
that
we
can
enjoy
the
wind
on
the
heath
in
camp
our
books
and
sport
and
school
all
these
things
come
to
us
through
men
like
wilfrid
and
patrick
columba
and
ninian
augustine
and
others
who
in
the
days
of
long
ago
came
to
lift
our
fathers
from
the
wretched
quarrelsome
life
and
from
the
starving
helplessness
of
the
men
of
the
shingle
beach
the
people
of
the
north
sea
islands
and
of
america
and
the
rest
of
the
christian
world
have
these
good
things
in
their
life
because
there
came
to
save
our
forefathers
heroic
missionaries
like
wilfrid
columba
and
augustine
there
are
men
of
the
south
sea
islands
who
are
even
more
helpless
than
our
saxon
grandfathers
to
get
without
giving
is
mean
to
take
the
torch
and
not
to
pass
it
on
is
to
fail
to
play
the
game
we
must
hand
on
to
the
others
the
light
that
has
come
to
us

the

of

dates
b
i
a
little
old
man
barefooted
and
bareheaded
and
riding
upon
an
ass
went
through
the
cities
and
towns
and
villages
of
europe
in
the
eleventh
century
carrying
not
a
lance
but
a
crucifix
when
he
came
near
a
town
the
word
ran
like
a
forest
fire
it
is
peter
the
hermit
all
the
people
rushed
out
their
hearts
burned
as
they
heard
him
tell
how
the
tomb
of
jesus
christ
was
in
the
hand
of
the
moslem
turk
of
how
christians
going
to
worship
at
his
tomb
in
jerusalem
were
thrown
into
prison
and
scourged
and
slain
knights
sold
lands
and
houses
to
buy
horses
and
lances
peasants
threw
down
the
axe
and
the
spade
for
the
pike
and
bow
and
arrows
led
by
knights
on
whose
armour
a
red
cross
was
emblazoned
the
people
poured
out
in
their
millions
for
the
first
crusade
it
is
said
that
in
the
spring
of
an
expeditionary
force
of
six
million
people
was
heading
toward
palestine
the
crusades
were
caused
partly
by
the
cruelty
of
the
followers
of
mohammed
the
moslem
turks
who
believed
that
they
could
earn
entrance
into
paradise
by
slaying
infidel
christians
the
moslems
every
day
and
five
times
a
day
turn
their
faces
to
mecca
in
arabia
saying
there
is
no
god
but
god
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
allah
they
believe
is
wise
and
merciful
to
his
own
but
not
holy
nor
our
father
nor
loving
and
forgiving
nor
desiring
pure
lives
on
earth
and
in
paradise
women
have
no
place
save
to
serve
men
the
first
crusade
ended
in
the
capture
of
jerusalem
july
and
godfrey
de
bouillon
became
king
of
jerusalem
but
godfrey
refused
to
put
a
crown
upon
his
head
for
he
said
i
will
not
wear
a
crown
of
gold
in
the
city
where
our
lord
jesus
christ
wore
a
crown
of
thorns
the
fortunes
of
christian
and
moslem
ebbed
and
flowed
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
during
which
time
there
were
seven
crusades
ending
at
the
fall
of
acre
into
the
hands
of
the
turks
in
the
way
of
the
sword
had
failed
though
indeed
the
crusades
had
probably
been
the
means
of
preventing
all
europe
from
being
overrun
by
the
moslems
at
the
time
when
the
last
crusade
had
begun
a
man
was
planning
a
new
kind
of
crusade
different
in
method
but
calling
for
just
as
much
bravery
as
the
old
kind
we
are
going
to
hear
his
story
now
ii
young
knight
in
the
days
of
the
last
of
the
crusades
a
knight
of
majorca
in
the
mediterranean
sea
stood
on
the
shore
of
his
island
home
gazing
over
the
water
raymund
lull
from
the
beach
of
palma
bay
where
he
had
played
as
a
boy
now
looked
out
southward
where
boats
with
their
tall
rakish
brown
sails
ran
in
from
the
great
sea
the
knight
was
dreaming
of
africa
which
lay
away
to
the
south
of
his
island
he
had
heard
many
strange
stories
from
the
sailors
about
the
life
in
the
harbours
of
that
mysterious
african
seaboard
but
he
had
never
once
in
his
years
set
eyes
upon
one
of
its
ports
it
was
the
year
when
prince
edward
of
england
out
on
the
mad
futile
adventure
of
the
last
crusade
was
felled
by
the
poisoned
dagger
of
an
assassin
in
nazareth
and
when
eleanor
we
are
told
drew
the
poison
from
the
wound
with
her
own
lips
yet
raymund
lull
who
was
a
knight
so
skilled
that
he
could
flash
his
sword
and
set
his
lance
in
rest
with
any
of
his
peers
had
not
joined
that
crusade
his
brave
father
carried
the
scars
of
a
dozen
battles
against
the
moors
yet
when
the
last
crusade
swept
down
the
mediterranean
lull
stood
aside
for
he
was
himself
planning
a
new
crusade
of
a
kind
unlike
any
that
had
gone
before
he
dreamed
of
a
crusade
not
to
the
holy
land
but
to
africa
where
the
crescent
of
mohammed
ruled
and
where
the
cross
of
christ
was
never
seen
save
when
an
arrogant
moslem
drew
a
cross
in
the
sand
of
the
desert
to
spit
upon
it
it
was
the
desire
of
raymund
lull
life
to
sail
out
into
those
perilous
ports
and
to
face
the
fierce
saracens
who
thronged
the
cities
he
longed
for
this
as
other
knights
panted
to
go
out
to
the
holy
land
as
crusaders
he
was
rich
enough
to
sail
at
any
time
for
he
was
his
own
master
why
then
did
he
not
take
one
of
the
swift
craft
that
rocked
in
the
bay
and
sail
it
was
because
he
had
not
yet
forged
a
sharp
enough
weapon
for
his
new
crusade
his
deep
resolve
was
that
at
all
costs
he
would
be
prepared
for
every
of
the
saracen
whose
tongue
was
as
swift
and
sharp
as
his
scimitar
what
powers
do
we
think
a
man
should
have
in
order
to
convince
fanatical
moslems
who
knew
their
own
sacred
book
the
koran
of
the
truth
of
christianity
control
of
his
own
temper
courage
patience
knowledge
of
the
moslem
religion
and
of
the
bible
suggest
themselves
iii
preparation
of
so
lull
turned
his
back
on
the
beach
and
on
africa
and
plunged
under
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
arched
gateway
through
the
city
wall
up
the
narrow
streets
of
palma
a
servant
opened
the
heavy
studded
door
of
his
father
mansion
the
house
where
lull
himself
was
born
he
hastened
in
and
calling
to
his
saracen
slave
strode
to
his
own
room
the
moor
obediently
came
bowed
before
his
young
master
and
laid
out
on
the
table
manuscripts
that
were
covered
with
mysterious
writing
such
as
few
people
in
europe
could
read
lull
was
learning
arabic
from
this
sullen
saracen
slave
he
was
studying
the
koran
the
bible
of
the
mohammedans
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
strive
with
the
saracens
on
their
own
ground
for
lull
knew
that
he
must
be
master
of
all
the
knowledge
of
the
moslem
if
he
was
to
win
his
battles
just
as
a
knight
in
the
fighting
crusades
must
be
swift
and
sure
with
his
sword
and
this
is
how
lull
spoke
of
the
crusade
on
which
he
was
to
set
out
i
see
many
knights
he
said
going
to
the
holy
land
beyond
the
seas
and
thinking
that
they
can
acquire
it
by
force
of
arms
but
in
the
end
all
are
destroyed
before
they
attain
that
which
they
think
to
have
whence
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
ought
not
to
be
attempted
except
in
the
way
in
which
christ
and
his
apostles
achieved
it
namely
by
love
and
prayers
and
the
pouring
out
of
tears
and
blood
suddenly
as
he
and
the
saracen
slave
argued
together
the
moor
blurted
out
passionately
a
horrible
blasphemy
against
the
name
of
jesus
lull
blood
was
up
he
leapt
to
his
feet
leaned
forward
and
caught
the
moor
a
swinging
blow
on
the
face
with
his
hand
in
a
fury
the
saracen
snatched
a
dagger
from
the
folds
of
his
robe
and
leaping
at
lull
drove
it
into
his
side
raymund
fell
with
a
cry
friends
rushed
in
the
saracen
was
seized
and
hurried
away
to
a
where
he
slew
himself
lull
as
he
lay
day
after
day
waiting
for
his
wound
to
heal
and
remembering
his
wild
blow
at
the
saracen
realised
that
although
he
had
learned
arabic
he
had
not
yet
learned
the
first
lesson
of
his
own
new
way
of
crusading
to
be
master
of
himself
iv
preparation
of
so
raymund
lull
at
home
and
in
rome
and
paris
set
himself
afresh
to
his
task
of
preparing
at
last
he
felt
that
he
was
ready
from
paris
he
rode
through
forest
and
across
plain
over
mountain
and
pass
till
the
gorgeous
palaces
and
the
thousand
masts
of
genoa
came
in
sight
he
went
down
to
the
harbour
and
found
a
ship
that
was
sailing
across
the
mediterranean
to
africa
he
booked
his
passage
and
sent
his
goods
with
all
his
precious
manuscripts
aboard
the
day
for
sailing
came
his
friends
came
to
cheer
him
but
lull
sat
in
his
room
trembling
as
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
in
shame
he
saw
the
fiery
persecuting
saracens
of
tunis
whom
he
was
sailing
to
meet
he
knew
they
were
glowing
with
pride
because
of
their
triumphs
over
the
crusaders
in
palestine
he
knew
they
were
blazing
with
anger
because
their
brother
moors
had
been
slaughtered
and
tortured
in
spain
he
saw
ahead
of
him
the
rack
the
and
the
boot
the
long
years
in
a
slimy
dungeon
at
the
best
the
executioner
scimitar
he
simply
dared
not
go
the
books
were
brought
ashore
again
the
ship
sailed
without
lull
the
ship
has
gone
said
a
friend
to
lull
he
quivered
under
a
torture
of
shame
greater
than
the
agony
of
the
rack
he
was
wrung
with
bitter
shame
that
he
who
had
for
all
these
years
prepared
for
this
crusade
should
now
have
shown
the
white
feather
he
was
indeed
a
craven
knight
of
christ
his
agony
of
spirit
threw
him
into
a
high
fever
that
kept
him
in
his
bed
soon
after
he
heard
that
another
ship
was
sailing
for
africa
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
his
friends
lull
insisted
that
they
should
carry
him
to
the
ship
they
did
so
but
as
the
hour
of
sailing
drew
on
his
friends
were
sure
that
he
was
so
weak
that
he
would
die
on
the
sea
before
he
could
reach
africa
so
this
time
in
spite
of
all
his
pleading
they
carried
him
ashore
again
but
he
could
not
rest
and
his
agony
of
mind
made
his
fever
worse
soon
however
a
third
ship
was
making
ready
to
sail
this
time
lull
was
carried
on
board
and
refused
to
return
the
ship
cast
off
and
threaded
its
way
through
the
shipping
of
the
harbour
out
into
the
open
sea
from
this
moment
said
lull
i
was
a
new
man
all
fever
left
me
almost
before
we
were
out
of
sight
of
land
v
first
passing
corsica
and
sardinia
the
ship
slipped
southward
till
at
last
she
made
the
yellow
coast
of
africa
broken
by
the
glorious
gulf
of
tunis
she
dropped
sail
as
she
ran
alongside
the
busy
wharves
of
goletta
lull
was
soon
gliding
in
a
boat
through
the
short
ancient
canal
to
tunis
the
mighty
city
which
was
head
of
all
the
western
mohammedan
world
he
landed
and
found
the
place
beside
the
great
mosque
where
the
scholars
bowed
over
their
korans
and
spoke
to
one
another
about
the
law
of
mohammed
they
looked
at
him
with
amazement
as
he
boldly
came
up
to
them
and
said
i
have
come
to
talk
with
you
about
christ
and
his
way
of
life
and
mohammed
and
his
teaching
if
you
can
prove
to
me
that
mohammed
is
indeed
prophet
i
will
myself
become
a
follower
of
him
the
moslems
sure
of
their
case
called
together
their
wisest
men
and
together
they
declaimed
to
lull
what
he
already
knew
very
well
the
watchword
that
rang
out
from
minaret
to
minaret
across
the
roofs
of
the
vast
city
as
the
first
flush
of
dawn
came
up
from
the
east
across
the
gulf
there
is
no
god
but
god
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
yes
he
replied
the
allah
of
mohammed
is
one
and
is
great
but
he
does
not
love
as
does
the
father
of
jesus
christ
he
is
wise
but
he
does
not
do
good
to
men
like
our
god
who
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
son
jesus
christ
to
and
fro
the
argument
swung
till
after
many
days
to
their
dismay
and
amazement
the
moslems
saw
some
of
their
number
waver
and
at
last
actually
beginning
to
go
over
to
the
side
of
lull
to
forsake
the
faith
of
mohammed
is
by
their
own
law
to
be
worthy
of
death
a
moslem
leader
hurried
to
the
sultan
of
tunis
see
he
said
this
learned
teacher
lull
is
declaring
the
errors
of
the
faith
he
is
dangerous
let
us
take
him
and
put
him
to
death
the
sultan
gave
the
word
of
command
a
body
of
soldiers
went
out
seized
lull
dragged
him
through
the
streets
and
threw
him
into
a
dark
dungeon
to
wait
the
death
sentence
but
another
moslem
who
had
been
deeply
touched
by
lull
teaching
craved
audience
with
the
sultan
see
he
said
this
learned
man
lull
if
he
were
a
moslem
would
be
held
in
high
honour
being
so
brave
and
fearless
in
defence
of
his
faith
do
not
slay
him
banish
him
from
tunis
so
when
lull
in
his
dungeon
saw
the
door
flung
open
and
waited
to
be
taken
to
his
death
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
led
from
the
dungeon
through
the
streets
of
tunis
taken
along
the
canal
thrust
into
the
hold
of
a
ship
and
told
that
he
must
go
in
that
ship
to
genoa
and
never
return
but
the
man
who
had
before
been
afraid
to
sail
from
genoa
to
tunis
now
escaped
unseen
from
the
ship
that
would
have
taken
him
back
to
safety
in
order
to
risk
his
life
once
more
he
said
to
himself
the
motto
he
had
written
he
who
loves
not
lives
not
he
who
lives
by
the
life
can
not
die
he
was
not
afraid
now
even
of
martyrdom
he
hid
among
the
wharves
and
gathered
his
converts
about
him
to
teach
them
more
and
more
about
christ
vi
last
at
last
however
seeing
that
he
could
do
little
in
hiding
lull
took
ship
to
naples
after
many
adventures
during
a
number
of
years
in
a
score
of
cities
and
on
the
seas
the
now
lull
sailed
into
the
curved
bay
of
bugia
farther
westward
along
the
african
coast
in
the
bay
behind
the
frowning
walls
the
city
with
its
glittering
mosques
climbed
the
hill
behind
rose
two
glorious
mountains
crowned
with
the
dark
green
of
the
cedar
and
far
off
like
giant
moors
wearing
white
turbans
rose
the
distant
mountain
peaks
crowned
with
snow
lull
passed
quietly
through
the
arch
of
the
city
gateway
which
he
knew
so
well
for
among
other
adventures
he
had
once
been
imprisoned
in
this
very
city
he
climbed
the
steep
street
and
found
a
friend
who
hid
him
away
there
for
a
year
lull
taught
in
secret
till
he
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
go
out
boldly
and
dare
death
itself
one
day
the
people
in
the
of
bugia
heard
a
voice
ring
out
that
seemed
to
some
of
them
strangely
familiar
they
hurried
toward
the
sound
there
stood
the
old
hero
with
arm
uplifted
declaring
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
north
african
day
the
love
of
god
shown
in
jesus
christ
his
son
the
saracens
murmured
they
could
not
answer
his
arguments
they
cried
to
him
to
stop
but
his
voice
rose
ever
fuller
and
bolder
they
rushed
on
him
dragged
him
by
the
cloak
out
of
the
down
the
streets
under
the
archway
to
a
place
beyond
the
city
walls
there
they
threw
back
their
sleeves
took
up
great
jagged
stones
and
hurled
these
grim
messengers
of
hate
at
the
apostle
of
love
till
he
sank
senseless
to
the
ground
it
was
word
for

wild
cries
of

accomplish

he

he
had
conquered
his
old
self

had
in

fit
of
temper
smitten
his
saracen
slave
now
smiled
on
the
men
who
stoned
him
and
the
lull
who
had
showed
the
white
feather
of
fear
at
genoa
now
defied
death
in
the
of
bugia
and
in
that
love
and
heroism
in

of
hate
and
death

had
shown
men

iv
francis
francis
of
date
of
incident
i
the
dark
blue
sky
of
an
italian
night
was
studded
with
sparkling
stars
that
seemed
to
be
twinkling
with
laughter
at
the
pranks
of
a
lively
group
of
gay
young
fellows
as
they
came
out
from
a
house
up
the
steep
street
of
the
little
city
of
assisi
as
they
strayed
together
down
the
street
they
sang
the
of
their
country
and
then
a
rich
strong
voice
rang
out
singing
a
song
in
french
that
is
francis
bernardone
one
neighbour
would
say
to
another
nodding
his
head
for
francis
could
sing
not
only
in
his
native
italian
but
also
in
french
he
lives
like
a
prince
yet
he
is
but
the
son
of
a
cloth
merchant
rich
though
the
merchant
be
so
the
neighbours
we
are
told
were
always
grumbling
about
francis
the
wild
spendthrift
for
young
francis
dressed
in
silk
and
always
in
the
latest
fashion
he
threw
his
about
with
a
free
hand
he
loved
beautiful
things
he
was
very
sensitive
he
would
ride
a
long
way
round
to
avoid
seeing
the
dreadful
face
of
a
poor
leper
and
would
hold
his
nose
in
his
cloak
as
he
passed
the
place
where
the
lepers
lived
he
was
handsome
in
face
gallant
in
bearing
idle
and
careless
a
jolly
companion
with
beautiful
courtly
manners
his
dark
chestnut
hair
curled
over
his
smooth
rather
small
forehead
his
black
twinkling
eyes
looked
out
under
level
brows
his
nose
was
straight
and
finely
shaped
when
he
laughed
he
showed
even
white
closely
set
teeth
between
thin
and
sensitive
lips
he
wore
a
short
black
beard
his
arms
were
shortish
his
fingers
long
and
sensitive
he
was
lightly
built
his
skin
was
delicate
he
was
witty
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
powerful
and
sonorous
yet
and
very
clear
for
him
to
be
the
son
of
a
merchant
seemed
to
the
gossips
of
assisi
all
wrong
as
though
a
grey
goose
had
hatched
out
a
gorgeous
peacock
the
song
of
the
revellers
passed
down
the
street
and
died
away
the
little
city
of
assisi
slept
in
quietness
on
the
slopes
of
the
apennine
mountains
under
the
dark
clear
sky
a
few
nights
later
however
no
song
of
any
revellers
was
heard
francis
bernardone
was
very
ill
with
a
fever
for
week
after
week
his
mother
nursed
him
and
each
night
hardly
believed
that
her
son
would
live
to
see
the
light
of
the
next
morning
when
at
last
the
fever
left
him
he
was
so
feeble
that
for
weeks
he
could
not
rise
from
his
bed
gradually
however
he
got
better
as
he
did
so
the
thing
that
he
desired
most
of
all
in
the
world
was
to
see
the
lovely
country
around
assisi
the
mountains
the
umbrian
plain
beneath
the
blue
skies
the
dainty
flowers
at
last
one
day
with
aching
limbs
and
in
great
feebleness
he
crept
out
of
doors
there
were
the
great
apennine
mountains
on
the
side
of
which
his
city
of
assisi
was
built
there
were
the
grand
rocky
peaks
pointing
to
the
intense
blue
sky
there
was
the
steep
street
with
the
houses
built
of
stone
of
a
strange
delicate
pink
colour
as
though
the
light
of
dawn
were
always
on
them
there
were
the
dark
green
olive
trees
and
the
lovely
tendrils
of
the
vines
the
gay
italian
flowers
were
blooming
stretching
away
in
the
distance
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
landscapes
of
the
world
the
broad
umbrian
plain
with
its
browns
and
greens
melting
in
the
distance
into
a
bluish
haze
that
softened
the
lines
of
the
distant
hills
how
he
had
looked
forward
to
seeing
it
all
to
being
in
the
sunshine
to
feeling
the
breeze
on
his
hot
brow
but
what
he
wondered
had
happened
to
him
he
looked
at
it
all
but
he
felt
no
joy
it
all
seemed
dead
and
empty
he
turned
his
back
on
it
and
crawled
indoors
again
sad
and
sick
at
heart
he
was
sure
that
he
would
never
feel
again
the
wild
joys
of
living
as
francis
went
back
to
his
bed
he
began
to
think
what
he
should
do
with
the
rest
of
his
life
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
waste
it
any
longer
but
he
did
not
see
clearly
what
he
should
do
with
it
a
short
time
after
francis
begged
a
young
nobleman
of
assisi
who
was
just
starting
to
fight
in
a
war
if
he
might
go
with
him
the
nobleman
walter
of
brienne
agreed
so
francis
bought
splendid
trappings
for
his
horse
and
a
shield
sword
and
spear
his
armour
and
his
horse
harness
were
more
splendid
than
even
those
of
walter
so
they
went
clattering
together
out
of
assisi
but
he
had
not
gone
thirty
miles
before
he
was
smitten
again
by
fever
after
sunset
one
evening
he
lay
dreamily
on
his
bed
when
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
francis
it
asked
what
could
benefit
thee
most
the
master
or
the
servant
the
rich
man
or
the
poor
the
master
and
the
rich
man
answered
francis
in
surprise
why
then
went
on
the
voice
dost
thou
leave
god
who
is
the
master
and
rich
for
man
who
is
the
servant
and
poor
then
lord
what
will
thou
that
i
do
asked
francis
return
to
thy
native
town
and
it
shall
be
shown
thee
there
what
thou
shall
do
said
the
voice
he
obediently
rose
and
went
back
to
assisi
he
tried
to
join
again
in
the
old
revels
but
the
joy
was
gone
he
went
quietly
away
to
a
cave
on
the
mountain
side
and
there
he
lay
as
young
mahomet
had
done
you
remember
five
centuries
before
to
wonder
what
he
was
to
do
then
a
vision
came
to
him
all
at
once
like
a
flash
his
mind
was
clear
and
his
soul
was
full
of
joy
he
saw
the
love
of
jesus
christ
who
had
lived
and
suffered
and
died
for
love
of
him
and
of
all
men
that
love
was
to
rule
his
own
life
he
had
found
his
captain
the
master
of
his
life
the
lord
of
his
service
christ
yet
even
now
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
he
went
home
and
told
his
friends
as
well
as
he
could
of
the
change
in
his
heart
some
smiled
rather
pityingly
and
went
away
saying
to
one
another
poor
fellow
a
little
mad
you
can
see
very
sad
for
his
parents
others
simply
laughed
and
mocked
one
day
very
lonely
and
sad
at
heart
he
clambered
up
the
mountain
side
to
an
old
church
just
falling
into
ruin
near
which
in
a
cavern
lived
a
priest
he
went
into
the
ruin
and
fell
on
his
knees
francis
a
voice
in
his
soul
seemed
to
say
dost
thou
see
my
house
going
to
ruin
buckle
to
and
repair
it
he
dashed
home
saddled
his
horse
loaded
it
with
rich
garments
and
rode
off
to
another
town
to
sell
the
goods
he
sold
the
horse
too
trudged
back
up
the
hill
and
gave
the
fat
purse
to
the
priest
no
said
the
priest
i
dare
not
take
it
unless
your
father
says
i
may
but
his
father
who
had
got
rumour
of
what
was
going
on
came
with
a
band
of
friends
to
drag
francis
home
francis
fled
through
the
woods
to
a
secret
cave
where
he
lay
hidden
till
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
face
all
he
came
out
and
walked
straight
towards
home
soon
the
townsmen
of
assisi
caught
sight
of
him
a
madman
they
yelled
throwing
stones
and
sticks
at
him
all
the
boys
of
assisi
came
out
and
hooted
and
threw
pebbles
his
father
heard
the
riot
and
rushed
out
to
join
in
the
fun
imagine
his
horror
when
he
found
that
it
was
his
own
son
he
yelled
with
rage
dashed
at
him
and
clutching
him
by
the
robe
dragged
him
along
beating
and
cursing
him
when
he
got
him
home
he
locked
him
up
but
some
days
later
francis
mother
let
him
out
when
his
father
was
absent
and
francis
climbed
the
hill
to
the
church
the
bishop
called
in
francis
and
his
father
to
his
court
to
settle
the
quarrel
you
must
give
back
to
your
father
all
that
you
have
said
he
i
will
replied
francis
he
took
off
all
his
rich
garments
and
clad
only
in
a
he
put
the
clothes
and
the
purse
of
money
at
his
father
feet
now
he
cried
i
have
but
one
father
henceforth
i
can
say
in
all
truth
father
who
art
in
heaven
a
peasant
cloak
was
given
to
francis
he
went
thus
without
home
or
any
money
a
wanderer
he
went
to
a
monastery
and
slaved
in
the
kitchen
a
friend
gave
him
a
tunic
some
shoes
and
a
stick
he
went
out
wandering
in
italy
again
he
loved
everybody
he
owned
nothing
he
wanted
everyone
to
know
the
love
of
jesus
as
he
knew
and
enjoyed
that
love
there
came
to
francis
many
adventures
he
was
full
of
joy
he
sang
even
to
the
birds
in
the
woods
many
men
joined
him
as
his
disciples
in
the
way
of
obedience
of
poverty
and
of
love
men
in
italy
in
spain
in
germany
and
in
britain
caught
fire
from
the
flame
of
his
simple
love
and
careless
courage
never
had
europe
seen
so
clear
a
vision
of
the
love
of
jesus
his
followers
were
called
the
lesser
brothers
friars
minor
all
who
can
should
read
the
story
of
francis
life
as
for
us
we
are
here
going
simply
to
listen
to
what
happened
to
him
on
a
strange
and
perilous
adventure
ii
about
this
time
people
all
over
europe
were
agog
with
excitement
about
the
crusades
four
crusades
had
come
and
gone
richard
was
dead
but
the
passion
for
fighting
against
the
saracen
was
still
in
the
hearts
of
men
the
tomb
of
our
lord
in
jerusalem
is
in
the
hands
of
the
saracen
the
cry
went
up
over
all
europe
followers
of
jesus
christ
are
slain
by
the
scimitars
of
islam
let
us
go
and
wrest
the
holy
city
from
the
hands
of
the
saracen
there
was
also
the
danger
to
europe
itself
the
mohammedans
ruled
in
spain
as
well
as
in
north
africa
in
egypt
and
in
the
holy
land
so
rich
men
sold
their
lands
to
buy
horses
and
armour
and
to
fit
themselves
and
their
foot
soldiers
for
the
fray
poor
men
came
armed
with
pike
and
helmet
and
leather
jerkin
the
knights
wore
a
cross
on
their
white
tunics
in
thousands
upon
thousands
with
john
of
brienne
as
their
the
brother
of
that
walter
of
brienne
with
whom
you
remember
francis
had
started
for
the
wars
as
a
knight
they
sailed
the
mediterranean
to
fight
for
the
cross
in
egypt
they
attacked
egypt
because
the
sultan
there
ruled
over
jerusalem
and
they
hoped
by
defeating
him
to
free
jerusalem
at
the
same
time
as
francis
saw
the
knights
going
off
to
the
crusades
in
shining
armour
with
the
trappings
of
their
horses
all
and
and
as
he
thought
of
the
lands
where
the
people
worshipped
not
the
god
and
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
but
the
sultan
in
the
sky
the
allah
of
mahomet
his
spirit
caught
fire
within
him
francis
had
been
a
soldier
and
a
knight
only
a
few
years
before
he
could
not
but
feel
the
stir
of
the
holy
war
in
his
veins
the
tingle
of
the
desire
to
be
in
it
he
heard
the
stories
of
the
daring
of
the
crusaders
he
heard
of
a
great
victory
over
the
saracens
francis
indeed
wanted
jesus
christ
to
conquer
men
more
than
he
wanted
anything
on
earth
but
he
knew
that
men
are
only
conquered
by
jesus
christ
if
their
hearts
are
changed
by
him
even
if
the
saracens
are
put
to
the
sword
and
overwhelmed
still
they
are
not
saved
he
said
to
himself
as
he
thought
these
things
he
felt
sure
that
he
heard
them
calling
to
him
as
the
man
from
macedonia
had
called
to
paul
come
over
and
help
us
paul
had
brought
the
story
of
jesus
christ
to
europe
and
had
suffered
prison
and
scourging
and
at
last
death
by
the
executioner
sword
in
doing
it
must
not
francis
be
ready
to
take
the
same
message
back
again
from
europe
to
the
near
east
and
to
suffer
for
it
i
will
go
he
said
but
to
save
the
saracens
not
to
slay
them
he
was
not
going
out
to
fight
yet
he
had
in
his
heart
a
plan
that
needed
him
to
be
braver
and
more
full
of
resource
than
any
warrior
in
the
armies
of
the
crusades
he
was
as
much
a
hero
as
richard
himself
and
was
far
wiser
and
indeed
more
powerful
so
he
took
a
close
friend
brother
illuminato
with
him
and
they
sailed
away
together
over
the
seas
they
sailed
from
italy
with
walter
of
brienne
with
one
of
the
crusading
contingents
in
many
ships
southeast
they
voyaged
over
the
blue
waters
of
the
mediterranean
sea
francis
talked
with
the
crusaders
on
board
and
much
that
they
said
and
did
made
him
very
sad
they
squabbled
with
one
another
the
knights
were
arrogant
and
sneered
at
the
foot
soldiers
the
did
not
trust
the
knights
they
had
the
cross
on
their
armour
but
few
of
them
had
in
their
hearts
the
spirit
of
jesus
who
was
nailed
to
the
cross
at
last
the
long
yellow
of
egypt
was
sighted
behind
it
lay
the
minarets
and
white
roofs
of
a
city
they
were
come
to
the
eastern
mouth
of
the
nile
on
which
stood
the
proud
city
of
damietta
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
smote
down
upon
the
army
of
the
crusaders
as
they
landed
the
sky
and
the
sea
were
of
an
intense
blue
the
sand
and
the
sun
glared
at
one
another
francis
would
just
be
able
to
hear
at
dawn
the
cry
of
the
muezzin
from
the
minarets
of
damietta
come
to
prayer
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mahomet
is
his
prophet
come
to
prayer
prayer
is
better
than
sleep
john
of
brienne
began
to
muster
his
men
in
battle
array
to
attack
the
sultan
of
egypt
a
name
which
means
the
perfect
prince
francis
however
was
quite
certain
that
the
attempt
would
be
a
ghastly
failure
he
hardly
knew
what
to
do
so
he
talked
it
over
with
his
friend
brother
illuminato
i
know
they
will
be
defeated
in
this
attempt
he
said
but
if
i
tell
them
so
they
will
treat
me
as
a
madman
on
the
other
hand
if
i
do
not
tell
them
then
my
conscience
will
condemn
me
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
my
brother
said
illuminate
what
does
the
judgment
of
the
world
matter
to
you
if
they
say
you
are
mad
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
francis
therefore
went
to
the
crusaders
and
warned
them
they
laughed
scornfully
the
order
for
advance
was
given
the
crusaders
charged
into
battle
francis
was
in
anguish
tears
filled
his
eyes
the
saracens
came
out
and
fell
upon
the
christian
soldiers
and
slaughtered
them
over
of
them
either
fell
under
the
scimitar
or
were
taken
prisoner
the
crusaders
were
defeated
francis
mind
was
now
fully
made
up
he
went
to
a
cardinal
who
represented
the
pope
with
the
crusading
army
to
ask
his
leave
to
go
and
preach
to
the
sultan
of
egypt
no
said
the
cardinal
i
can
not
give
you
leave
to
go
i
know
full
well
that
you
would
never
escape
to
come
back
alive
the
sultan
of
egypt
has
offered
a
reward
of
gold
to
any
man
who
will
bring
to
him
the
head
of
a
christian
that
will
be
your
fate
do
suffer
us
to
go
we
do
not
fear
death
pleaded
francis
and
illuminato
again
and
again
i
do
not
know
what
is
in
your
minds
in
this
said
the
cardinal
but
beware
if
you
go
that
your
thoughts
are
always
to
god
we
only
wish
to
go
for
great
good
if
we
can
work
it
replied
francis
then
if
you
wish
it
so
much
the
cardinal
at
last
agreed
you
may
go
so
francis
and
illuminato
girded
their
loins
and
tightened
their
sandals
and
set
away
from
the
crusading
army
towards
the
very
camp
of
the
enemy
as
he
walked
francis
sang
with
his
full
loud
clear
voice
these
were
the
words
that
he
sang
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff
they
comfort
me
as
they
walked
along
over
the
sandy
waste
they
saw
two
small
sheep
nibbling
the
sparse
grass
growing
near
the
nile
be
of
good
cheer
said
francis
to
illuminato
smiling
it
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
gospel
words
i
send
you
as
sheep
in
the
midst
of
wolves
then
there
appeared
some
saracen
soldiers
they
were
at
first
for
letting
the
two
unarmed
men
go
by
but
on
questioning
francis
they
grew
angrier
and
angrier
are
you
deserters
from
the
christian
camp
they
asked
no
replied
francis
are
you
envoys
from
the
commander
come
to
plead
for
peace
no
was
the
answer
again
will
you
give
up
the
infidel
religion
and
become
a
true
believer
and
say
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mahomet
is
his
prophet
no
no
cried
francis
we
are
come
to
preach
the
good
news
of
jesus
christ
to
the
sultan
of
egypt
the
eyes
of
the
saracen
soldiers
opened
with
amazement
they
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
their
faces
flushed
under
their
dark
skins
with
anger
chain
them
they
cried
to
one
another
beat
them
the
infidels
chains
were
brought
and
snapped
upon
the
wrists
and
ankles
of
francis
and
illuminato
then
they
took
rods
and
began
to
beat
the
two
men
just
as
paul
and
silas
had
been
beaten
eleven
centuries
earlier
as
the
rods
whistled
through
the
air
and
came
slashing
upon
their
wounded
backs
francis
kept
crying
out
one
word
soldan
soldan
that
is
sultan
sultan
he
thus
made
them
understand
that
he
wished
to
be
taken
to
their
so
they
decided
to
take
these
strange
beings
to
as
the
sultan
sat
in
his
pavilion
francis
and
illuminato
were
led
in
they
bowed
and
saluted
him
courteously
and
returned
the
salute
have
you
come
with
a
message
from
your
commander
said
the
sultan
no
replied
francis
you
wish
then
to
become
saracens
worshippers
of
allah
in
the
name
of
mahomet
nay
nay
answered
francis
saracens
we
will
never
be
we
have
come
with
a
message
from
god
it
is
a
message
that
will
save
your
life
if
you
die
under
the
law
of
mahomet
you
are
lost
we
have
come
to
tell
you
so
if
you
listen
to
us
we
will
show
all
this
to
you
the
sultan
seems
to
have
been
amused
and
interested
rather
than
angry
i
have
bishops
and
archbishops
of
my
own
he
said
they
can
tell
me
all
that
i
wish
to
know
of
this
we
are
glad
replied
francis
send
and
fetch
them
if
you
will
the
sultan
agreed
he
sent
for
eight
of
his
moslem
great
men
when
they
came
in
he
said
to
them
see
these
men
they
have
come
to
teach
us
a
new
faith
shall
we
listen
to
them
sire
they
answered
him
at
once
thou
knowest
the
law
thou
art
bound
to
uphold
it
and
carry
it
out
by
mahomet
who
gave
us
the
law
to
slay
infidels
we
command
thee
that
their
heads
be
cut
off
we
will
not
listen
to
a
word
that
they
say
off
with
their
heads
the
great
men
having
given
their
judgment
solemnly
left
the
presence
of
the
sultan
the
sultan
turned
to
francis
and
illuminato
masters
he
said
to
them
they
have
commanded
me
by
mahomet
to
have
your
heads
cut
off
but
i
will
go
against
the
law
for
you
have
risked
your
lives
to
save
my
immortal
soul
now
leave
me
for
the
time
the
two
christian
missionaries
were
led
away
but
in
a
day
or
two
called
them
to
his
presence
again
if
you
will
stay
in
my
dominions
he
said
i
will
give
you
land
and
other
possessions
yes
said
francis
i
will
stay
on
one
condition
that
you
and
your
people
turn
to
the
worship
of
the
true
god
see
he
went
on
let
us
put
it
to
the
test
your
priests
here
and
he
pointed
to
some
who
were
standing
about
they
will
not
let
me
talk
with
them
will
they
do
something
have
a
great
fire
lighted
i
will
walk
into
the
fire
with
them
the
result
will
shew
you
whose
faith
is
the
true
one
as
francis
suggested
this
idea
the
faces
of
the
moslem
leaders
were
transfigured
with
horror
they
turned
and
quietly
walked
away
i
do
not
think
said
the
sultan
with
a
sarcastic
smile
at
their
retreating
backs
that
any
of
my
priests
are
ready
to
face
the
flames
to
defend
their
faith
well
i
will
go
into
the
fire
said
francis
if
i
am
burned
it
is
because
of
my
sins
if
i
am
protected
by
god
then
you
will
own
him
as
your
god
no
replied
the
sultan
i
will
not
listen
to
the
idea
of
such
a
trial
of
your
life
for
my
soul
but
he
was
astonished
beyond
measure
at
the
amazing
faith
of
francis
so
francis
withdrew
from
the
presence
of
the
sultan
who
at
once
sent
after
him
rich
and
costly
presents
you
must
take
them
back
said
francis
to
the
messengers
i
will
not
take
them
take
them
to
build
your
churches
and
support
your
priests
said
the
sultan
through
his
messengers
but
francis
would
not
take
any
gift
from
the
sultan
he
left
him
and
went
back
with
illuminato
from
the
saracen
host
to
the
camp
of
the
crusaders
as
he
was
leaving
the
sultan
secretly
spoke
with
francis
and
said
will
you
pray
for
me
that
i
may
be
guided
by
an
inspiration
from
above
that
i
may
join
myself
to
the
religion
that
is
most
approved
by
god
the
sultan
told
off
a
band
of
his
soldiers
to
go
with
the
two
men
and
to
protect
them
from
any
molesting
till
they
reached
the
camp
there
is
a
legend
though
no
one
now
can
tell
whether
it
is
true
or
not
that
when
the
sultan
of
egypt
lay
dying
he
sent
for
a
disciple
of
francis
to
be
with
him
and
pray
for
him
whether
this
was
so
or
not
it
is
quite
clear
that
francis
had
left
in
the
memory
of
the
sultan
such
a
vision
of
dauntless
faith
as
he
had
never
seen
before
or
was
ever
to
see
again
the
crusaders
failed
to
win
egypt
or
the
holy
land
but
men
are
going
from
america
and
britain
in
the
footsteps
of
francis
of
assisi
the
christian
missionary
to
carry
to
the
people
in
egypt
in
the
holy
land
and
in
all
the
near
east
the
message
that
francis
took
of
the
love
of
jesus
christ
the
stories
of
some
of
the
deeds
they
have
done
and
are
doing
we
shall
read
in
later
chapters
in
this
book
book
two
the
island
adventurers
chapter
v
the
adventurous
ship
date
of
incident
a
ship
crept
quietly
down
the
river
thames
on
an
she
was
slipping
out
from
the
river
into
the
estuary
when
suddenly
a
challenge
rang
out
across
the
grey
water
what
ship
is
that
was
the
answer
that
came
back
from
the
little
ship
whose
captain
had
passed
through
a
hundred
hairsbreadth
escapes
in
his
life
but
was
now
starting
on
the
strangest
adventure
of
them
all
whither
bound
came
the
challenge
again
from
the
that
had
hailed
them
otaheite
came
the
answer
which
would
startle
the
government
officer
for
tahiti
as
we
now
call
it
was
many
thousands
of
miles
away
in
the
heart
of
the
south
pacific
ocean
indeed
it
had
only
been
discovered
by
captain
cook
years
earlier
in
was
a
small
such
as
one
of
our
american
ocean
liners
of
could
put
into
her
dining
saloon
what
cargo
the
question
came
again
from
the
officer
on
the
missionaries
and
provisions
was
captain
wilson
answer
the
captain
was
puzzled
he
did
not
know
what
strange
beings
might
be
meant
by
missionaries
he
was
suspicious
were
they
pirates
perhaps
in
disguise
we
can
understand
how
curious
it
would
sound
to
him
when
we
remember
that
although
wilfrid
and
augustine
and
columba
had
gone
to
britain
as
missionaries
over
a
thousand
years
before
started
down
the
thames
no
cargo
of
missionaries
had
ever
before
sailed
from
those
north
sea
islands
of
britain
to
the
savages
of
other
lands
like
the
south
sea
islands
there
was
a
hurried
order
and
a
scurry
on
board
the
government
ship
a
boat
was
let
down
into
the
thames
and
half
a
dozen
sailors
tumbled
into
her
and
rowed
to
what
did
the
officer
find
he
was
met
at
the
rail
by
a
man
who
had
been
through
scores
of
adventures
captain
wilson
the
son
of
the
captain
of
a
newcastle
collier
wilson
had
grown
up
a
sailor
boy
he
enlisted
as
a
soldier
in
the
american
war
became
captain
of
a
vessel
trading
with
india
and
was
then
captured
and
imprisoned
by
the
french
in
india
he
escaped
from
prison
by
climbing
a
great
wall
and
dropping
down
forty
feet
on
the
other
side
he
plunged
into
a
river
full
of
alligators
and
swam
across
escaping
the
jaws
of
alligators
only
to
be
captured
on
the
other
bank
by
indians
chained
and
made
to
march
barefoot
for
miles
then
he
was
thrust
into
hyder
ali
loathsome
prison
starved
and
loaded
with
irons
and
at
last
at
the
end
of
two
years
was
set
free
this
was
the
daring
hero
who
had
now
undertaken
to
captain
the
little
across
the
oceans
of
the
world
to
the
south
seas
with
captain
wilson
the

but
on
trying
to

violent
gales
that
captain

turned
her
in

tracks
and
headed
back
across
the
atlantic
for
the
cape

after

for
thousands
and
thousands
of

we
see

island
the
boys
on
board
would
ask
captain
wilson
day
after
day
he
shook
his
head
but
one
night
he
said
if
the
wind
holds
good
we
shall
see
an
island
in
the
morning
but
not
the
island
where
we
shall
stop

a
sailor
from
the
masthead
in
the
morning
and
sure
enough
they
saw
away
on
the
horizon
like
a
cloud
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
the
island
of
toobonai
as
they
passed
toobonai
the
wind
rose
and
howled
through
the
rigging
it
tore
at
the
sail
of
duff
and
the
great
pacific
waves
rolled
swiftly
by
rushing
and
hissing
along
the
sides
of
the
little
ship
and
tossing
her
on
their
foaming
crests
but
she
weathered
the
storm
and
as
the
wind
dropped
and
they
looked
ahead
they
saw
cutting
into
the
the
mountain
tops
of
tahiti
it
was
saturday
night
when
the
island
came
in
sight
early
on
the
sunday
morning
by
seven
swung
round
under
a
gentle
breeze
into
matavai
bay
and
dropped
anchor
but
before
she
could
even
anchor
the
whole
bay
had
become
alive
with
tahitians
they
thronged
the
beach
and
leaping
into
canoes
sent
them
skimming
across
the
bay
to
the
ship
captain
wilson
scanning
the
canoes
swiftly
and
anxiously
saw
with
relief
that
the
men
were
not
armed
but
the
missionaries
were
startled
when
the
savages
climbed
up
the
sides
of
the
ship
and
with
wondering
eyes
rolling
in
their
wild
heads
peered
over
the
rail
of
the
deck
they
then
leapt
on
board
and
began
dancing
like
mad
on
the
deck
with
their
bare
feet
from
the
canoes
the
tahitians
hauled
up
pigs
fowl
fish
bananas
and
held
them
for
the
white
men
to
buy
but
captain
wilson
and
all
his
company
would
not
buy
on
that
day
for
it
was
sunday
the
missionaries
gathered
together
on
deck
to
hold
their
sunday
morning
service
the
tahitians
stopped
dancing
and
looked
on
with
amazement
as
the
company
of
white
men
with
their
children
knelt
to
pray
and
then
read
from
the
bible
the
tahitians
could
not
understand
this
strange
worship
with
no
god
that
could
be
seen
but
when
the
white
fathers
and
mothers
and
children
sang
the
savages
stood
around
with
wonder
and
delight
on
their
faces
as
they
listened
to
the
strange
and
beautiful
sounds
but
the
startling
events
of
the
day
were
not
over
for
out
from
the
beach
came
a
canoe
across
the
bay
and
in
it
two
swedish
sailors
named
like
some
fishermen
of
long
ago
peter
and
andrew
these
white
men
knew
some
english
but
lived
not
as
christians
but
as
the
natives
lived
and
after
them
came
a
great
and
aged
chief
named
haamanemane
this
great
chief
went
up
to
the
chief
of
the
ship
captain
wilson
and
called
out
to
him
taio
they
did
not
know
what
this
meant
till
peter
the
swede
explained
that
haamanemane
wished
to
be
the
brother
the
of
captain
wilson
they
were
even
to
change
names
captain
wilson
would
be
called
haamanemane
and
haamanemane
would
be
called
wilson
so
captain
wilson
said
taio
and
he
and
the
chief
who
was
also
high
priest
of
the
gods
of
tahiti
were
brothers
captain
wilson
said
to
haamanemane
through
peter
who
translated
each
to
the
other
we
wish
to
come
and
live
in
this
island
haamanemane
said
that
he
would
speak
to
the
king
and
queen
of
tahiti
about
it
so
he
got
down
again
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
into
the
canoe
and
the
paddles
of
his
boatman
flashed
as
they
swept
along
over
the
breakers
to
the
beach
to
tell
the
king
of
the
great
white
chief
who
had
come
to
visit
them
all
these
things
happened
on
the
sunday
on
tuesday
word
came
that
the
king
and
the
queen
would
receive
them
so
captain
wilson
and
all
his
missionaries
got
into
the
and
pulled
for
the
shore
the
natives
rushed
into
the
water
seized
the
boat
and
hauled
her
aground
out
of
reach
of
the
great
waves
they
were
startled
to
see
the
king
and
queen
come
riding
on
the
shoulders
of
men
even
when
one
bearer
grew
tired
and
the
king
or
the
queen
must
get
upon
another
they
were
not
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
the
reason
was
that
all
the
land
they
touched
became
their
own
and
the
people
carried
them
about
so
that
they
themselves
might
not
lose
their
land
and
houses
by
the
king
and
queen
touching
them
so
at
that
place
under
the
palm
trees
of
tahiti
with
the
beating
of
the
surf
on
the
shore
before
them
and
the
great
mountain
forests
behind
these
brown
islanders
of
the
south
seas
gave
a
part
of
their
land
to
captain
wilson
and
his
men
that
they
might
live
there
the
sons
of
the
wild
men
of
the
north
sea
islands
had
met
their
first
great
adventure
in
bringing
to
the
men
of
the
south
sea
islands
the
story
of
the
love
of

the

beacon
fires
date
of
incident
the
edge
of
the
sea
was
just
beginning
to
gleam
with
the
gold
of
the
rising
sun
the
captain
of
a
little
ship
that
tossed
and
rolled
on
the
tumbling
ocean
looked
out
anxiously
over
the
bow
around
him
everywhere
was
the
wild
waste
of
the
pacific
ocean
through
day
after
day
he
had
tacked
and
veered
baffled
by
contrary
winds
now
with
little
food
left
in
the
ship
starvation
on
the
open
ocean
stared
them
in
the
face
they
were
searching
for
an
island
of
which
they
had
heard
but
which
they
had
never
seen
the
captain
searched
the
horizon
again
but
he
saw
nothing
except
that
ahead
of
him
on
the
to
the
great
clouds
had
gathered
he
turned
round
and
went
to
the
the
hero
and
explorer
and
shipbuilder
john
williams
saying
we
must
give
up
the
search
or
we
shall
all
be
starved
john
williams
knew
that
this
was
true
yet
he
hated
the
thought
of
going
back
he
was
a
scout
exploring
at
the
head
of
god
navy
he
had
left
his
home
in
london
and
with
his
young
wife
had
sailed
across
the
world
to
the
south
seas
to
carry
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
to
the
people
there
he
was
living
on
the
island
of
raiatea
but
as
he
himself
said
i
can
not
be
confined
within
the
limits
of
a
single
reef
he
wanted
to
pass
on
the
torch
to
other
islands
so
he
was
now
on
this
voyage
of
discovery
it
was
seven
when
the
captain
told
john
williams
that
they
must
give
up
the
search
in
an
hour
time
said
williams
we
will
turn
back
if
we
have
not
sighted
rarotonga
so
they
sailed
on
the
sun
climbed
the
sky
the
cool
dawn
was
giving
way
to
the
heat
of
day
go
up
the
mast
and
look
ahead
said
williams
to
a
south
sea
island
native
then
he
paced
the
deck
hoping
to
hear
the
cry
of
land
but
nothing
could
the
native
see
go
up
again
cried
williams
a
little
later
and
again
there
was
nothing
four
times
the
man
climbed
the
mast
and
four
times
he
reported
only
sea
and
sky
and
cloud
gradually
the
sun
heat
had
gathered
up
the
great
mountains
of
cloud
and
the
sky
was
clear
to
the
edge
of
the
ocean
then
there
came
a
sudden
cry
from
the
masthead
teie
teie
taua
fenua
nei
here
here
is
the
land
we
have
been
seeking
all
rushed
to
the
bows
as
the
ship
sailed
on
and
they
came
nearer
they
saw
a
lovely
island
mountains
towering
peak
on
peak
with
deep
green
valleys
between
brown
rocky
heights
hung
with
vines
and
the
great
ocean
breakers
booming
in
one
white
line
of
foaming
surf
on
the
reef
of
living
coral
made
it
look
like
a
vision
of
fairyland
they
had
discovered
rarotonga
but
what
of
the
people
of
the
island
they
were
said
to
be
cannibals
would
they
receive
the
missionaries
with
clubs
and
spears
who
would
go
ashore
on
board
the
ship
were
brown
south
sea
men
from
the
island
where
john
williams
lived
they
had
burned
their
idols
and
now
they
too
were
missionaries
of
jesus
christ
their
leader
was
a
fearless
young
man
papeiha
he
was
so
daring
that
once
when
everybody
else
was
afraid
to
go
from
the
ship
to
a
cannibal
island
he
bound
his
bible
in
his
loin
cloth
tied
them
to
the
top
of
his
head
and
swam
ashore
defying
the
sharks
and
unafraid
of
the
still
more
cruel
islanders
so
at
rarotonga
when
the
call
came
who
will
go
ashore
and
a
canoe
was
let
down
from
the
ship
side
two
men
papeiha
and
his
friend
vahineino
leapt
into
it
those
two
fearlessly
paddled
towards
the
shore
which
was
now
one
brown
stretch
of
rarotongans
crowded
together
to
see
this
strange
ship
with
wings
that
had
sailed
from
over
the
sea
edge
the
rarotongans
seemed
friendly
so
papeiha
and
vahineino
who
knew
the
ways
of
the
water
from
babyhood
and
could
swim
before
they
could
walk
waited
for
a
great
pacific
breaker
and
then
swept
in
on
her
foaming
crest
the
canoe
grated
on
the
shore
they
walked
up
the
beach
under
the
shade
of
a
grove
of
trees
and
said
to
the
rarotongan
king
makea
and
his
people
we
have
come
to
tell
you
that
many
of
the
islands
of
the
sea
have
burned
their
idols
once
we
in
those
islands
pierced
each
other
with
spears
and
beat
each
other
to
death
with
clubs
we
brutally
treated
our
women
and
the
children
taken
in
war
were
strung
together
by
their
ears
like
fish
on
a
line
we
come
before
you
have
destroyed
each
other
altogether
in
your
wars
to
tell
you
of
the
great
god
our
father
who
through
his
son
jesus
christ
has
taught
us
how
to
live
as
brothers
king
makea
said
he
was
pleased
to
hear
these
things
and
came
in
his
canoe
to
the
ship
to
take
the
other
native
teachers
on
shore
with
him
the
ship
stood
off
for
the
night
for
the
ocean
there
is
too
deep
for
anchorage
papeiha
and
his
brown
friends
with
their
wives
went
ashore
night
fell
and
they
were
preparing
to
sleep
when
above
the
thud
and
hiss
of
the
waves
they
heard
the
noise
of
approaching
crowds
the
footsteps
and
the
talking
came
nearer
while
the
little
group
of
christians
listened
intently
at
last
a
chief
carried
by
his
warriors
came
near
he
was
the
fiercest
and
most
powerful
chief
on
the
island
when
he
came
close
to
papeiha
and
his
friends
the
chief
demanded
that
the
wife
of
one
of
the
christian
teachers
should
be
given
to
him
so
that
he
might
take
her
away
with
him
as
his
twentieth
wife
the
teachers
argued
with
the
chief
the
woman
wept
but
he
ordered
the
woman
to
be
seized
and
taken
off
she
resisted
as
did
the
others
their
clothes
were
torn
to
tatters
by
the
ferocious
rarotongans
all
would
have
been
over
with
the
christians
had
not
tapairu
a
brave
rarotongan
woman
and
the
cousin
of
the
king
opposed
the
chiefs
and
even
fought
with
her
hands
to
save
the
teacher
wife
at
last
the
fierce
chief
gave
in
and
papeiha
and
his
friends
before
the
sun
had
risen
hurried
to
the
beach
leapt
into
their
canoe
and
paddled
swiftly
to
the
ship
we
must
wait
and
come
to
this
island
another
day
when
the
people
are
more
friendly
said
every
one
except
papeiha
who
never
would
turn
back
let
me
stay
with
them
said
he
he
knew
that
he
might
be
slain
and
eaten
by
the
savage
cannibals
on
the
island
but
without
fuss
leaving
everything
he
had
upon
the
ship
except
his
clothes
and
his
native
testament
he
dropped
into
his
canoe
seized
the
paddle
and
with
swift
strong
strokes
that
never
faltered
drove
the
canoe
skimming
over
the
rolling
waves
till
it
leapt
to
the
summit
of
a
breaking
wave
and
ground
upon
the
shore
the
savages
came
jostling
and
waving
spears
and
clubs
as
they
crowded
round
him
let
us
take
him
to
makea
so
papeiha
was
led
to
the
chief
as
he
walked
he
heard
them
shouting
to
one
another
i
have
his
hat
i
have
his
jacket
have
his
shirt
at
length
he
reached
the
chief
who
looked
and
said
speak
to
us
o
man
that
we
may
know
why
you
persist
in
coming
i
come
he
answered
looking
round
on
all
the
people
so
that
you
may
all
learn
of
the
true
god
and
that
you
like
all
the
people
in
the
islands
of
the
sea
may
take
your
gods
made
of
wood
of
birds
feathers
and
of
cloth
and
burn
them
a
roar
of
anger
and
horror
burst
from
the
people
what
they
cried
burn
the
gods
what
gods
shall
we
then
have
what
shall
we
do
without
the
gods
they
were
angry
but
there
was
something
in
the
bold
face
of
papeiha
that
kept
them
from
slaying
him
they
allowed
him
to
stay
and
did
not
kill
him
soon
after
this
papeiha
one
day
heard
shrieking
and
shouting
and
wild
roars
as
of
men
in
a
frenzy
he
saw
crowds
of
people
round
the
gods
offering
food
to
them
the
priests
with
faces
blackened
with
charcoal
and
with
bodies
painted
with
stripes
of
red
and
yellow
the
warriors
with
great
waving
of
birds
feathers
and
white
papeiha
without
taking
any
thought
of
the
peril
that
he
rushed
into
went
into
the
midst
of
the
people
and
said
why
do
you
act
so
foolishly
why
do
you
take
a
log
of
wood
and
carve
it
and
then
offer
it
food
it
is
only
fit
to
be
burned
some
day
soon
you
shall
make
these
very
gods
fuel
for
fire
so
with
the
companion
who
came
to
help
him
brown
papeiha
went
in
and
out
of
the
island
just
as
brave
paul
went
in
and
out
in
the
island
of
cyprus
and
wilfrid
in
britain
he
would
take
his
stand
now
under
a
grove
of
bananas
on
a
great
stone
and
now
in
a
village
where
the
people
from
the
huts
gathered
round
and
again
on
the
beach
where
he
would
lift
up
his
voice
above
the
boom
of
the
ocean
breakers
to
tell
the
story
of
jesus
and
some
of
those
degraded
savages
became
christians
one
day
he
was
surprised
to
see
one
of
the
priests
come
to
him
leading
his
boy
take
care
of
my
boy
said
the
priest
i
am
going
to
burn
my
god
and
i
do
not
want
my
god
anger
to
hurt
the
boy
ask
your
god
to
protect
him
so
the
priest
went
home
next
morning
quite
early
before
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
great
papeiha
looked
out
and
saw
the
priest
tottering
along
with
bent
and
aching
shoulders
on
his
back
was
his
cumbrous
wooden
god
behind
the
priest
came
a
furious
crowd
waving
their
arms
and
crying
out
madman
madman
the
god
will
kill
you
you
may
shout
answered
the
priest
but
you
will
not
change
me
i
am
going
to
worship
jehovah
the
god
of
papeiha
and
with
that
he
threw
down
the
god
at
the
feet
of
the
teachers
one
of
them
ran
and
brought
a
saw
and
first
cut
off
its
head
and
then
sawed
it
into
logs
some
of
the
rarotongans
rushed
away
in
dread
others
even
some
of
the
newly
converted
christians
hid
in
the
bush
and
peered
through
the
leaves
to
see
what
would
happen
papeiha
lit
a
fire
the
logs
were
thrown
on
the
first
rarotongan
idol
was
burned
you
will
die
cried
the
priests
of
the
fallen
god
but
to
show
that
the
god
was
just
a
log
of
wood
the
teachers
took
a
bunch
of
bananas
placed
them
on
the
ashes
where
the
fire
had
died
down
and
roasted
them
then
they
sat
down
and
ate
the
bananas
the
watching
people
looked
to
see
the
teachers
fall
dead
but
nothing
happened
the
islanders
then
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
the
god
of
papeiha
was
not
the
true
god
within
a
year
they
had
got
together
hundreds
of
their
wooden
idols
and
had
burned
them
in
enormous
bonfires
which
flamed
on
the
beach
and
lighted
up
the
dark
background
of
trees
those
bonfires
could
be
seen
far
out
across
the
pacific
ocean
like
a
beacon
light
the
flames
of
love
which
papeiha
bravely
lighted
through
perils
by
water
and
club
and
cannibal
feast
have
shone
right
across
the
ocean
and
some
of
the
grandchildren
of
those
very
rarotongans
who
were
cannibals
when
papeiha
went
there
have
sailed
away
as
we
shall
see
later
on
to
preach
papeiha
gospel
of
the
love
of
god
to
the
cannibal
papuans
on
the
steaming
shores
of
new

the
daybreak
call
date
of
incident
two
men
leaned
on
the
rail
of
the
brig
as
she
swept
slowly
along
the
southern
side
of
the
island
of
erromanga
in
the
western
pacific
a
steady
breeze
filled
her
sails
the
sea
heaved
in
long
silky
billows
the
red
glow
of
the
rising
sun
was
changing
to
the
full
clear
light
of
morning
the
men
as
they
talked
scanned
the
closely
there
was
the
grey
beach
and
behind
the
beach
the
dense
bush
and
the
waving
fronds
of
palms
behind
the
palms
rose
the
volcanic
hills
of
the
island
the
elder
man
straightened
himself
and
looked
keenly
to
the
bay
from
which
a
canoe
was
swiftly
gliding
he
was
a
broad
sturdy
man
with
thick
brown
hair
over
keen
watchful
eyes
his
open
look
was
fearless
and
winning
his
hands
which
grasped
the
rail
had
both
the
strength
and
the
skill
of
the
trained
mechanic
and
the
writer
for
john
williams
could
build
a
ship
make
a
boat
and
sail
them
both
against
any
man
in
all
the
pacific
he
could
work
with
his
hammer
at
the
forge
in
the
morning
make
a
table
at
his
bench
in
the
afternoon
preach
a
powerful
sermon
in
the
evening
and
write
a
chapter
of
the
most
thrilling
of
books
on
missionary
travel
through
the
night
yet
next
morning
would
see
him
in
his
ship
with
her
sails
spread
moving
out
into
the
open
pacific
bound
for
a
distant
island
it
is
strange
williams
was
saying
to
his
friend
cunningham
but
i
have
not
slept
all
through
the
night
how
came
it
that
this
man
who
for
over
twenty
years
had
faced
tempests
by
sea
who
had
never
flinched
before
perils
from
savage
men
and
from
fever
on
the
shores
of
a
hundred
islands
in
the
south
seas
should
stay
awake
all
night
as
his
ship
skirted
the
strange
island
of
erromanga
it
was
because
having
lived
for
all
those
years
among
the
coral
islands
of
the
brown
polynesians
of
the
eastern
pacific
he
was
now
sailing
to
the
new
hebrides
where
the
fierce
black
cannibal
islanders
of
the
western
pacific
slew
one
another
as
he
thought
of
the
fierce
men
of
erromanga
he
thought
of
the
waving
forests
of
brown
hands
he
had
seen
the
shouts
of
come
back
again
to
us
that
he
had
heard
as
he
left
his
own
islands
he
knew
how
those
people
loved
him
in
the
samoan
islands
but
he
could
not
rest
while
others
lay
far
off
who
had
never
heard
the
story
of
jesus
i
can
not
be
content
he
said
within
the
narrow
limits
of
a
single
reef
but
the
black
islanders
were
wild
men
who
covered
their
dark
faces
with
soot
and
painted
their
lips
with
flaming
red
yet
their
cruel
hearts
were
blacker
than
their
faces
and
their
anger
more
fiery
than
their
scarlet
lips
they
were
treacherous
and
violent
savages
who
would
smash
a
skull
by
one
blow
with
a
great
club
or
leaping
on
a
man
from
behind
would
cut
through
his
spine
with
a
single
stroke
of
their
tomahawks
and
then
drag
him
off
to
their
cannibal
oven
john
williams
cared
so
much
for
his
work
of
telling
the
islanders
about
god
their
father
that
he
lay
awake
wondering
how
he
could
carry
it
on
among
these
wild
people
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
he
should
hold
back
to
save
himself
from
danger
it
was
for
this
work
that
he
had
crossed
the
world
let
down
the
his
voice
rang
out
without
a
tremor
of
fear
his
eyes
were
on
the
canoe
in
which
three
black
erromangans
were
paddling
across
the
bay
as
the
boat
touched
the
water
he
and
the
crew
of
four
dropped
into
her
with
captain
morgan
and
two
friends
harris
and
cunningham
the
oars
dipped
and
flashed
in
the
morning
sun
as
the
flew
along
towards
the
canoe
when
they
reached
it
williams
spoke
in
the
dialects
of
his
other
islands
but
none
could
the
three
savages
in
the
canoe
understand
so
he
gave
them
some
beads
and
as
a
present
to
show
that
he
was
a
friend
and
again
his
boat
shot
away
toward
the
beach
they
pulled
to
a
creek
where
a
brook
ran
down
in
a
lovely
valley
between
two
mountains
on
the
beach
stood
some
erromangan
natives
with
their
eyes
half
fierce
half
frightened
looking
out
under
their
matted
jungle
of
hair
picking
up
a
bucket
from
the
boat
williams
held
it
out
to
the
chief
and
made
signs
to
show
that
he
wished
for
water
from
the
brook
the
chief
took
the
bucket
and
turning
ran
up
the
beach
and
disappeared
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
waited
and
for
half
an
hour
at
last
when
the
sun
was
now
high
in
the
sky
the
chief
returned
with
the
water
williams
drank
from
the
water
to
show
his
friendliness
then
his
friend
harris
swinging
himself
over
the
side
of
the
boat
waded
ashore
through
the
cool
sparkling
shallow
water
and
sat
down
the
natives
ran
away
but
soon
came
back
with
and
opened
them
for
him
to
drink
see
said
williams
there
are
boys
playing
on
the
beach
that
is
a
good
sign
yes
answered
captain
morgan
but
there
are
no
women
and
when
the
savages
mean
mischief
they
send
their
women
away
williams
now
waded
ashore
and
cunningham
followed
him
captain
morgan
stopped
to
throw
out
the
anchor
of
his
little
boat
and
then
stepped
out
and
went
ashore
leaving
his
crew
of
four
brown
islanders
resting
on
their
oars
williams
and
his
two
companions
scrambled
up
the
stony
beach
over
the
grey
stones
and
boulders
alongside
the
tumbling
brook
for
over
a
hundred
yards
turning
to
the
right
they
were
lost
to
sight
from
the
captain
morgan
was
just
following
them
when
he
heard
a
terrified
yell
from
the
crew
in
the
boat
williams
and
his
friends
had
gone
into
the
bush
harris
in
front
cunningham
next
and
williams
last
suddenly
harris
who
had
disappeared
in
the
bush
rushed
out
followed
by
yelling
savages
with
clubs
harris
rushed
down
the
bank
of
the
brook
stumbled
and
fell
in
the
water
dashed
over
him
and
the
erromangans
with
the
red
fury
of
slaughter
in
their
eyes
leapt
in
and
beat
in
his
skull
with
clubs
cunningham
with
a
native
at
his
heels
with
lifted
club
stooped
picked
up
a
great
pebble
and
hurled
it
full
at
the
savage
who
was
pursuing
him
the
man
was
stunned
turning
again
cunningham
leapt
safely
into
the
boat
williams
leaving
the
brook
had
rushed
down
the
beach
to
leap
into
the
sea
reaching
the
edge
of
the
water
where
the
beach
falls
steeply
into
the
sea
he
slipped
on
a
pebble
and
fell
into
the
water
cunningham
from
the
boat
hurled
stones
at
the
natives
rushing
at
williams
who
lay
prostrate
in
the
water
with
a
savage
over
him
with
uplifted
club
the
club
fell
and
other
erromangans
rushing
in
beat
him
with
their
clubs
and
shot
their
arrows
into
him
until
the
ripples
of
the
beach
ran
red
with
his
blood
the
hero
who
had
carried
the
flaming
torch
of

on

to

his
head
and
great
tears
welled
out
from
the
eyes
of

dark
islander
and
ran
down
his
cheeks
the

pélé
the
the

goddess
will
hurl
her
thunder
and
her
stones
and
will
slay
you
cried
the
angry
priests
of
hawaii
you
no
longer
pay
your
sacrifices
to
her
once
you
gave
her
hundreds
of
hogs
but
now
you
give
nothing
you
worship

great
pélé
will
come
upon
you
she
and
the
husband
of
thunder
with
the
and
the
they
will
destroy
you
altogether
the
listening
hawaiians
shuddered
as
they
saw
the
shaggy
priests
calling
down
the
anger
of
pélé
one
of
the
priests
was
a
gigantic
man
over
six
feet
five
inches
high
whose
strength
was
so
terrible
that
he
could
leap
at
his
victims
and
break
their
bones
by
his
embrace
away
there
in
the
volcanic
island
in
the
centre
of
the
greatest
ocean
in
the
world
the
pacific
ocean
they
had
always
as
children
been
taught
to
fear
the
great
goddess
they
were
christians
but
they
had
only
been
christians
for
a
short
time
and
they
still
trembled
at
the
name
of
the
goddess
pélé
who
lived
up
in
the
mountains
in
the
boiling
crater
of
the
fiery
volcano
and
ruled
their
island
their
fathers
had
told
them
how
she
would
get
angry
and
would
pour
out
rivers
of
molten
stone
that
would
eat
up
all
the
trees
and
people
and
run
hissing
into
the
pacific
ocean
there
to
that
day
was
that
river
of
stone
a
long
tongue
of
cold
hard
lava
stretching
down
to
the
shore
of
the
island
and
here
across
the
trees
on
the
could
be
seen
even
now
the
smoke
of
her
anger
perhaps
after
all
pélé
was
greater
than
jehovah
she
was
certainly
terrible
and
she
was
very
near
if
you
do
not
offer
fire
to
her
as
you
used
to
do
the
priests
went
on
she
will
pour
down
her
fire
into
the
sea
and
kill
all
your
fish
she
will
fill
up
your
fishing
grounds
with
the
pahoehoe
lava
and
you
will
starve
great
is
pélé
and
greatly
to
be
feared
the
priests
were
angry
because
the
preaching
of
the
missionaries
had
led
many
away
from
the
worship
of
pélé
which
of
course
meant
fewer
hogs
for
themselves
and
now
the
whole
nation
on
hawaii
that
volcanic
island
of
the
seas
seemed
to
be
deserting
her
the
people
began
to
waver
under
the
threats
but
a
woman
with
strong
fearless
eyes
that
looked
out
with
scorn
on
pélé
priests
was
not
to
be
terrified
it
is
kapiolani
the
chieftainess
murmured
the
people
to
one
another
she
is
christian
will
she
forsake
jehovah
and
return
to
pélé
only
four
years
before
this
kapiolani
had
according
to
the
custom
of
the
hawaiian
chieftainesses
married
many
husbands
and
she
had
given
way
to
drinking
habits
then
she
had
become
a
christian
giving
up
her
drinking
and
sending
away
all
her
husbands
save
one
she
had
thrown
away
her
idols
and
now
taught
the
people
in
their
huts
the
story
of
christ
pélé
is
nought
she
declared
i
will
go
to
kilawea
the
mountain
of
the
fires
where
the
smoke
and
stones
go
up
and
pélé
shall
not
touch
me
my
god
jehovah
made
the
mountain
and
the
fires
within
it
too
as
he
made
us
all
so
it
was
noised
through
the
island
that
kapiolani
the
queenly
would
defy
pélé
the
goddess
the
priests
threatened
her
with
awful
torments
of
fire
from
the
goddess
her
people
pleaded
with
her
not
to
dare
the
fires
of
kilawea
but
kapiolani
pressed
on
and
eighty
of
her
people
made
up
their
minds
to
go
with
her
she
climbed
the
mountain
paths
through
lovely
valleys
hung
with
trees
up
and
up
to
where
the
hard
rocky
cut
the
feet
of
those
who
walked
upon
it
day
by
day
they
asked
her
to
go
back
and
always
she
answered
if
i
am
destroyed
you
may
believe
in
pélé
if
i
live
you
must
all
believe
in
the
true
god
jehovah
as
she
drew
nearer
to
the
crater
she
saw
the
great
cloud
of
smoke
that
came
up
from
the
volcano
and
felt
the
heat
of
its
awful
fires
but
she
did
not
draw
back
as
she
climbed
upward
she
saw
by
the
side
of
the
path
low
bushes
and
on
them
beautiful
red
and
yellow
berries
growing
in
clusters
the
berries
were
like
large
currants
it
is
chelo
said
the
priests
it
is
pélé
berry
you
must
not
touch
them
unless
we
ask
her
she
will
breathe
fire
on
you
kapiolani
broke
off
a
branch
from
one
of
the
bushes
regardless
of
the
horrified
faces
of
the
priests
and
she
ate
the
berries
without
stopping
to
ask
the
goddess
for
her
permission
she
carried
a
branch
of
the
berries
in
her
hand
if
she
had
told
them
what
she
was
going
to
do
they
would
have
been
frenzied
with
fear
and
horror
up
she
climbed
until
the
full
terrors
of
the
boiling
crater
of
kilawea
burst
on
her
sight
before
her
an
immense
gulf
yawned
in
the
shape
of
the
crescent
moon
eight
miles
in
circumference
and
over
a
thousand
feet
deep
down
in
the
smoking
hollow
hundreds
of
feet
beneath
her
a
lake
of
fiery
lava
rolled
in
flaming
waves
against
precipices
of
rock
this
lake
of
molten
fire
is
called
the
house
of
everlasting
burning
this
surging
lake
was
dotted
with
tiny
mountain
islets
and
from
the
tops
of
their
little
peaks
pyramids
of
flame
blazed
and
columns
of
grey
smoke
went
up
from
some
of
these
little
islands
streams
of
blazing
lava
rolled
down
into
the
lake
of
fire
the
air
was
filled
with
the
roar
of
the
furnaces
of
flame
even
the
fearless
kapiolani
stood
in
awe
as
she
looked
but
she
did
not
flinch
though
here
and
there
as
she
walked
the
crust
of
the
lava
cracked
under
her
feet
and
the
ground
was
hot
with
hidden
fire
she
came
to
the
very
edge
of
the
crater
to
come
so
far
without
offering
hogs
and
fish
to
the
fiery
goddess
was
in
itself
enough
to
bring
a
fiery
river
of
molten
lava
upon
her
kapiolani
offered
nothing
save
defiance
audacity
they
thought
could
go
no
further
here
a
priestess
of
pélé
came
and
raising
her
hands
in
threat
denounced
death
on
the
head
of
kapiolani
if
she
came
further
kapiolani
pulled
from
her
robe
a
book
in
it
for
it
was
her
new
testament
she
read
to
the
priestess
of
the
one
true
loving
then
kapiolani
did
a
thing
at
which
the
very
limbs
of
those
who
watched
trembled
and
shivered
she
went
to
the
edge
of
the
crater
and
stepped
over
onto
a
jutting
rock
and
let
herself
down
and
down
toward
the
sulphurous
burning
lake
the
ground
cracked
under
her
feet
and
sulphurous
steam
hissed
through
crevices
in
the
rock
as
though
the
demons
of
pélé
fumed
in
their
frenzy
hundreds
of
staring
wondering
eyes
followed
her
fascinated
and
yet
horrified
then
she
stood
on
a
ledge
of
rock
and
offering
up
prayer
and
praise
to
the
god
of
all
who
made
the
volcano
and
who
made
her
she
cast
the
pélé
berries
into
the
lake
and
sent
stone
after
stone
down
into
the
flaming
lava
it
was
the
most
awful
insult
that
could
be
offered
to
pélé
now
surely
she
would
leap
up
in
fiery
anger
and
with
a
hail
of
burning
stones
consume
kapiolani
but
nothing
happened
and
kapiolani
turning
climbed
the
steep
ascent
of
the
crater
edge
and
at
last
stood
again
unharmed
among
her
people
she
spoke
to
her
people
telling
them
again
that
jehovah
made
the
fires
she
called
on
them
all
to
sing
to
his
praise
and
for
the
first
time
there
rang
across
the
crater
of
kilawea
the
song
of
christians
the
power
of
the
priests
was
gone
and
from
that
hour
the
people
all
over
that
island
who
had
trembled
and
hesitated
between
pélé
and
christ
turned
to
the
worship
of
our
lord
jesus
the
son
of
god
the
father
almighty

looked
like
a
tiny

canoe
far
away
across
the

as
elikana
glanced
back
from
his
place
at
the
tiller
he
sang
meantime
quietly
to
himself
an
air
that
still
rang
in
his
ears
the
tune
that
he
and
his
brother
islanders
had
sung
in
praise
of
the
power
and
providence
of
god
at
the
services
on
manihiki
for
the
christian
people
of
the
penrhyn
group
of
south
sea
islands
had
come
together
in
april
for
their
yearly
meeting
paddling
from
the
different
quarters
in
their
canoes
through
the
white
surge
of
the
breakers
that
thunder
day
and
night
round
the
island
elikana
looked
ahead
to
where
his
own
island
of
rakahanga
grew
clearer
every
moment
on
the
ahead
of
them
though
each
time
his
craft
dropped
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
between
the
green
curves
of
the
ocean
rollers
the
island
was
lost
from
sight
he
and
his
six
companions
were
sailing
back
over
the
thirty
miles
between
manihiki
and
rakahanga
two
of
the
many
little
lonely
ocean
islands
that
stud
the
pacific
like
stars
they
sailed
a
strange
craft
for
it
can
not
be
called
raft
or
canoe
or
hut
it
was
all
these
and
yet
was
neither
two
canoes
feet
long
sailed
side
by
side
between
the
canoes
were
spars
stretching
across
from
one
to
the
other
lashed
to
each
boat
and
making
a
platform
between
them
six
feet
wide
on
this
was
built
a
hut
roofed
with
the
beautiful
braided
leaves
of
the
palm
overhead
stretched
the
infinite
sky
underneath
lay
thousands
of
fathoms
of
ocean
whose
cold
hidden
deeps
among
the
mountains
and
valleys
of
the
awful
ocean
held
strange
goblin
and
on
the
surface
this
hut
of
leaves
and
bamboo
swung
dizzily
between
sky
and
ocean
on
the
frail
canoes
and
in
the
canoes
and
the
hut
were
six
brown
rakahangan
men
two
women
and
a
chubby
child
who
sat
contented
and
tired
being
lapped
to
sleep
by
the
swaying
waters
above
them
the
great
sail
made
of
matting
of
fibre
strained
in
the
breeze
that
drove
them
nearer
to
the
haven
where
they
would
be
already
they
could
see
the
gleam
of
the
rakahanga
beach
with
the
rim
of
silver
where
the
waves
broke
into
foam
then
the
breeze
dropped
the
flapped
uneasily
against
the
mast
while
the
two
little
canvas
sails
hung
loosely
as
the
wind
with
little
warning
swung
round
and
smiting
them
in
the
face
began
to
drive
them
back
into
the
ocean
again
elikana
and
his
friends
knew
the
sea
almost
like
fish
from
the
time
they
were
babies
and
they
were
little
troubled
by
the
turn
of
the
breeze
save
that
it
would
delay
their
homecoming
they
tried
in
vain
to
make
headway
slowly
but
surely
they
were
driven
back
from
land
till
they
could
see
that
there
was
no
other
thing
but
just
to
turn
about
and
let
her
run
back
to
manihiki
in
the
canoes
were
enough
to
feed
them
for
days
if
need
be
and
two
large
calabashes
of
water
the
swift
night
fell
but
the
wind
held
strong
and
one
man
sat
at
the
tiller
while
two
others
baled
out
the
water
that
leaked
into
the
canoes
they
kept
a
keen
watch
expecting
to
sight
manihiki
but
when
the
dawn
flashed
out
of
the
sky
in
the
east
where
the
island
should
have
been
there
was
neither
manihiki
nor
any
other
land
at
all
they
had
no
chart
nor
compass
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
stretched
the
wastes
of
the
pacific
for
hundreds
of
leagues
only
here
and
there
in
the
ocean
and
all
unseen
to
them
like
little
groups
of
mushrooms
on
a
limitless
prairie
lay
groups
of
islets
they
might
indeed
sail
for
a
year
without
ever
sighting
any
land
and
one
wave
of
the
great
ocean
could
smite
their
little
craft
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
they
gathered
together
in
the
hut
and
with
anxious
faces
talked
of
what
they
might
do
they
knew
that
far
off
to
the
southwest
lay
the
islands
of
samoa
and
rarotonga
so
they
set
the
bows
of
their
craft
southward
morning
grew
to
blazing
noon
and
fell
to
evening
and
night
and
nothing
did
they
see
save
the
glittering
sparkling
waters
of
the
uncharted
ocean
cut
here
and
there
by
the
cruel
fin
of
a
waiting
shark
it
was
saturday
when
they
started
and
night
fell
seven
times
while
their
wonderful
crept
southward
along
the
water
till
the
following
friday
then
the
wind
changed
and
springing
up
from
the
south
drove
them
wearily
back
once
more
in
their
tracks
and
then
bore
them
eastward
for
another
week
they
drove
before
the
breeze
feeding
on
the
but
the
water
in
the
calabashes
was
gone
then
on
the
morning
of
the
second
friday
the
fourteenth
day
of
their
just
when
the
sun
in
mid
heaven
was
blazing
its
upon
them
and
most
of
the
little
crew
were
lying
under
the
shade
of
the
hut
and
the
sail
to
doze
away
the
hours
of
tedious
hunger
they
heard
the
cry
of
land
and
leaping
to
their
feet
gazed
ahead
at
the
welcome
sight
with
sail
and
paddle
they
urged
the
craft
on
toward
the
island
then
night
fell
and
with
it
squalls
of
wind
and
rain
came
and
buffeted
them
till
they
had
to
forsake
the
paddles
for
the
to
keep
the
boat
afloat
taking
down
the
sails
they
spread
them
flat
to
catch
the
pouring
rain
and
then
poured
this
precious
fresh
water
true
water
of
life
to
them
into
their
calabashes
but
when
morning
came
no
land
could
be
seen
anywhere
it
was
as
though
the
island
had
been
a
land
of
enchantment
and
mirage
and
now
had
faded
away
yet
hope
sprang
in
them
erect
and
glad
next
day
when
land
was
sighted
again
but
the
sea
and
the
wind
as
though
driven
by
the
spirits
of
contrariness
smote
them
back
for
two
more
days
they
guided
the
canoe
with
the
tiller
and
tried
to
set
her
in
one
steady
direction
then
tired
and
out
of
heart
after
sixteen
days
of
ceaseless
and
useless
effort
they
gave
it
up
and
let
her
drift
for
the
winds
and
currents
to
take
her
where
they
would
at
night
each
man
stood
in
his
canoe
almost
starving
and
parched
with
thirst
with
aching
back
stooping
to
dip
the
water
from
the
canoe
and
rising
to
pour
it
over
the
side
for
hour
after
hour
while
the
calm
moon
slowly
climbed
the
sky
each
slaved
at
his
dull
task
lulled
by
the
heave
and
fall
of
the
rollers
as
they
slid
under
the
keels
of
the
canoes
the
men
nearly
dropped
asleep
where
they
stood
the
quiet
waters
crooned
to
them
like
a
mother
singing
an
old
lullaby
crooned
and
called
till
a
voice
deep
within
them
said
it
is
better
to
lie
down
and
sleep
and
die
than
to
live
and
fight
and
starve
then
a
moan
from
the
sleeping
child
or
a
sight
of
a
streaming
ray
of
moonlight
on
the
face
of
its
mother
would
send
that
nameless
voice
shivering
back
to
its
deep
and
the
man
would
stoop
and
bail
again
each
evening
as
it
fell
saw
their
anxious
eyes
looking
west
and
north
and
south
for
land
and
always
there
was
only
the
weary
waste
of
waters
and
as
the
sun
rose
they
hardly
dared
open
their
eyes
to
the
unbroken
rim
of
that
circled
them
like
a
steel
prison
they
saw
the
thin
edge
of
the
moon
grow
to
full
blaze
and
then
fade
to
a
corn
sickle
again
as
days
and
nights
grew
to
weeks
and
a
whole
month
had
passed
every
morning
as
the
sea
turned
to
pink
and
then
to
gleaming
blue
they
knelt
on
the
raft
between
the
canoes
and
turned
their
faces
up
to
their
father
in
prayer
and
never
did
the
sun
sink
behind
the
rim
of
waters
without
the
sound
of
their
voices
rising
into
the
limitless
sky
with
thanks
for
slowly
the
pile
of
lessened
each
one
of
them
with
its
sweet
milk
and
flesh
was
more
precious
to
them
than
a
golden
chalice
set
with
rubies
the
drops
of
milk
that
dripped
from
them
were
more
than
ropes
of
pearls
at
last
eight
sundays
had
followed
one
upon
another
and
now
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
was
only
the
half
of
one
remaining
when
that
was
gone
all
would
be
over
so
they
knelt
down
under
the
cloudless
sky
on
an
evening
calm
and
beautiful
they
were
on
that
invisible
line
in
the
great
pacific
where
the
day
ends
and
begins
those
seven
on
the
tiny
craft
were
indeed
we
can
not
but
believe
the
last
worshippers
in
all
the
great
of
god
as
sunday
drew
to
its
end
just
where
they
were
was
it
to
be
the
last
time
that
they
would
pray
to
god
in
this
life
prayer
ended
night
was
falling
elikana
the
leader
who
had
kept
their
spirits
from
utterly
failing
stood
up
and
gazed
out
with
great
anxious
eyes
before
the
last
light
should
fail
look
there
upon
the
edge
of
the
sea
where
the
sun
sets
is
it
he
could
hardly
dare
to
believe
that
it
was
not
the
mirage
of
his
weary
brain
but
one
and
another
and
then
all
peered
out
through
the
swiftly
waning
light
and
saw
that
indeed
it
was
land
then
a
squall
of
wind
sprang
up
blowing
them
away
from
the
land
was
this
last
hope
by
a
fine
ecstasy
of
torture
to
be
dangled
before
them
and
then
snatched
away
but
with
the
danger
came
the
help
with
the
wind
came
the
rain
cool
sweet
refreshing
water
then
the
squall
of
wind
dropped
and
changed
they
hoisted
the
one
sail
that
had
not
blown
to
tatters
and
drove
for
land
yet
their
most
awful
danger
still
lay
before
them
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
cruel
coral
reef
caught
their
ears
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
risk
the
peril
they
were
among
the
breakers
which
caught
and
tossed
them
on
like
eggshells
the
scourge
of
the
surf
swept
them
a
woman
a
man
even
the
child
were
torn
from
them
and
ground
on
the
ghastly
teeth
of
the
coral
five
were
swept
over
with
the
craft
into
the
still
blue
lagoon
and
landing
they
fell
prone
upon
the
shore
just
breathing
and
no
more
after
the
giant
buffeting
of
the
thundering
rollers
following
the
long
slow
starvation
of
their
wonderful
journey
in
the
hut
on
the
canoes
among
the
waters
of
the
wondrous
isles
wake
the
silver
dusk
returning
up
the
beach
of
darkness
brims
and
the
ship
of
sunrise
burning
strands
upon
the
eastern
rims
ii
thrown
up
by
the
ocean
in
the
darkness
like
driftwood
elikana
and
his
companions
lay
on
the
grey
shore
against
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
and
beyond
the
beach
of
darkness
they
could
see
the
fronds
of
the
palms
waving
the
five
survivors
were
starving
and
the
green
hung
above
them
filled
with
food
and
drink
but
their
bodies
broken
and
tormented
as
they
were
by
hunger
and
the
battering
breakers
refused
even
to
rise
and
climb
for
the
food
that
meant
life
so
they
lay
there
as
though
dead
over
the
ridge
of
the
beach
came
a
man
his
pale
copper
skin
shone
in
the
fresh
sunlight
of
the
morning
his
quick
black
eyes
were
caught
by
the
sight
of
torn
clothing
hanging
on
a
bush
moving
swiftly
down
the
beach
of
pounded
coral
he
saw
a
man
lying
with
arms
thrown
out
face
downward
turning
the
body
over
faivaatala
found
that
the
man
was
dead
taking
the
body
in
his
arms
he
staggered
with
it
up
the
beach
and
placed
it
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
returning
he
found
the
living
five
their
gaunt
bodies
and
the
broken
craft
on
the
shore
told
him
without
words
the
story
of
their
long
drifting
over
the
wilderness
of
the
waters
without
stopping
to
waste
words
in
empty
sympathy
with
starving
men
faivaatala
ran
to
the
nearest
tree
and
climbing
it
threw
down
luscious
nuts
those
below
quickly
knocked
off
the
tops
drank
deep
draughts
of
the
cool
milk
and
then
ate
coming
down
again
faivaatala
kindled
a
fire
and
soon
had
some
fish
grilling
for
these
strange
wanderers
thrown
up
on
the
tiny
islet
they
had
no
time
to
thank
him
before
he
ran
off
and
swiftly
paddled
to
motutala
the
island
where
he
lived
to
tell
the
story
of
these
strange
castaways
he
came
back
with
other
helpers
in
canoes
and
the
five
getting
aboard
were
swiftly
paddled
to
motutala
as
the
canoes
skimmed
over
the
surface
of
the
great
lagoon
elikana
and
his
friends
could
see
spread
out
in
a
great
that
stretched
to
the
horizon
the
long
low
coral
islets
crowned
with
palms
which
form
part
of
the
ellice
islands
the
islanders
men
women
and
children
ran
down
the
beach
to
see
the
newcomers
and
soon
had
set
apart
huts
for
them
and
made
them
welcome
elikana
gathered
them
round
him
and
began
to
tell
them
about
the
love
of
jesus
and
the
protecting
care
of
god
the
father
it
all
seemed
strange
to
them
but
quickly
they
learned
from
him
and
he
began
to
teach
them
and
their
children
this
went
on
for
four
months
till
one
day
elikana
said
i
must
go
away
and
learn
more
so
that
i
can
teach
you
more
but
they
had
become
so
fond
of
elikana
that
they
said
no
you
must
not
leave
us
and
it
was
only
when
he
promised
to
come
back
with
another
teacher
to
help
him
that
they
could
bring
themselves
to
part
with
him
so
when
a
ship
came
to
the
island
to
trade
in
elikana
went
aboard
and
sailed
to
samoa
to
the
london
missionary
society
training
college
there
at
malua
a
ship
a
ship
the
cry
was
taken
up
through
the
island
and
the
people
running
down
the
beach
saw
a
large
sailing
vessel
boats
put
down
and
sculls
flashed
as
sailors
pulled
swiftly
to
the
shore
they
landed
and
the
people
gathered
round
to
see
and
to
hear
what
they
would
say
come
onto
our
ship
said
these
men
who
had
sailed
there
from
peru
and
we
will
show
you
how
you
can
be
rich
with
many
knives
and
much
calico
but
the
islanders
shook
their
heads
and
said
they
would
stay
where
they
were
then
a
wicked
white
man
named
tom
rose
who
lived
on
the
island
and
knew
how
much
the
people
were
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
elikana
would
come
back
to
teach
them
went
to
the
traders
and
whispered
what
he
knew
to
them
so
the
peruvian
traders
with
craft
shining
in
their
eyes
turned
again
to
the
islanders
and
said
if
you
will
come
with
us
we
will
take
you
where
you
will
be
taught
all
that
men
can
know
about
god
at
this
the
islanders
broke
out
into
glad
cries
and
speaking
to
one
another
said
let
us
go
and
learn
these
things
the
day
came
for
sailing
and
as
the
sun
rose
hundreds
of
brown
feet
were
running
to
the
beach
children
dancing
with
excitement
women
saying
goodbye
to
their
husbands
men
who
for
the
first
time
in
all
their
lives
were
to
leave
their
tiny
islet
for
the
wonderful
world
beyond
the
ocean
so
two
hundred
of
them
went
on
board
the
sails
were
hoisted
and
they
went
away
never
to
return
sailed
away
not
to
learn
of
jesus
but
to
the
sting
of
the
lash
and
the
shattering
bullet
the
bondage
of
the
plantations
and
to
death
at
the
hands
of
those
merciless
beasts
of
prey
the
peruvian
slavers
years
passed
and
a
little
trading
vessel
came
to
anchor
outside
the
reef
one
man
and
then
another
and
another
got
down
into
the
little
boat
and
pulled
for
the
shore
elikana
had
returned
the
women
and
children
ran
down
to
meet
him
but
few
men
were
there
for
nearly
all
had
gone
where
is
this
one
where
is
the
other
cried
elikana
with
sad
face
as
he
looked
around
on
them
gone
gone
came
the
answer
carried
away
by
the
ships
elikana
turned
to
the
white
missionary
who
had
come
with
him
to
ask
what
they
could
do
we
will
leave
joane
and
his
wife
here
replied
murray
so
a
teacher
from
samoa
stayed
there
and
taught
the
people
while
elikana
went
to
begin
work
in
an
island
near
by
a
white
lady
missionary
has
gone
to
live
in
the
ellice
islands
and
the
people
are
christians
and
no
can
come
to
snatch
them
away
so
there
sailed
over
the
waters
of
the
wondrous
isles
first
the
boat
of
sunrise
and
then
the
ship
of
darkness
and
last
of
all
the
ship
of
the
peace
of
god
the
ship
of
darkness
had
seemed
for
a
time
to
conquer
but
her
day
is
now
over
and
on
that
beach
as
the
sunlight
brims
over
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
a
new
lord
day
dawns
you
may
hear
the
islanders
sing
their
praise
to
the
light
of
the
world
who
shines
upon
them
and
keeps
them

the
brown
crew
of
southern
breathed
freely
again
as
the
anchor
swung
into
place
and
the
schooner
began
to
nose
her
way
out
into
the
open
pacific
they
were
hardened
to
dangers
but
the
island
of
tawny
cannibals
had
strained
their
nerve
by
its
hourly
perils
from
club
and
flying
arrow
the
men
were
glad
to
see
their
ship
bows
plunge
freely
again
through
the
rollers
as
they
set
her
course
to
the
island
of
santa
cruz
the
crew
talked
together
of
the
men
of
the
island
they
had
left
in
his
cabin
sat
a
great
bronzed
bearded
man
writing
a
letter
to
his
own
people
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
here
are
the
very
words
that
he
wrote
as
he
told
the
story
of
one
of
the
dangers
through
which
they
had
just
passed
on
the
island
as
i
sat
on
the
beach
with
a
crowd
about
me
most
of
them
suddenly
jumped
up
and
ran
off
turning
my
head
i
saw
a
man
from
the
boat
they
saw
two
coming
to
me
with
club
uplifted
i
remained
sitting
and
held
out
a
few
to
him
but
one
or
two
men
jumped
up
and
seizing
him
by
the
waist
forced
him
off
after
a
few
minutes
i
went
back
to
the
boat
i
found
out
that
a
poor
fellow
called
moliteum
was
shot
dead
two
months
ago
by
a
white
trader
for
stealing
a
bit
of
calico
the
wonder
was
not
that
they
wanted
to
avenge
the
death
of
their
kinsman
but
that
others
should
have
prevented
it
how
could
they
possibly
know
that
i
was
not
one
of
the
wicked
set
yet
they
did
the
plan
of
going
among
the
people
unarmed
makes
them
regard
me
as
a
friend
then
he
says
of
these
men
who
had
just
tried
to
kill
him
the
people
though
constantly
fighting
and
cannibals
and
the
rest
of
it
are
to
me
very
attractive
the
ship
sailed
on
till
they
heard
ahead
of
them
the
beating
of
the
surf
on
the
reef
of
santa
cruz
behind
the
silver
line
of
the
breakers
the
waving
fronds
of
her
palms
came
into
sight
they
put
southern
in
cast
anchor
and
let
a
boat
down
from
her
side
into
the
boat
tumbled
a
british
sailor
named
pearce
a
young
englishman
named
atkin
and
three
brown
island
boys
from
the
missionary
training
college
for
native
teachers
on
norfolk
island
and
their
leader
bishop
patteson
the
white
man
who
having
faced
the
clubs
of
savages
on
a
score
of
islands
never
flinched
from
walking
into
peril
again
to
lead
them
to
know
of
the
best
man
in
the
world
jesus
christ
these
brown
boys
were
young
helpers
of
bishop
patteson
and
one
of
them
especially
fisher
young
would
have
died
for
his
great
white
leader
gladly
they
were
like
father
and
son
the
reef
covered
at
with
curling
waters
mottled
with
the
foam
of
the
broken
waves
was
alive
with
men
while
the
beach
beyond
was
black
with
crowds
of
the
wild
islanders
who
had
come
down
to
see
the
strange
visitors
from
the
ship
the
four
men
sculled
the
boat
on
to
the
edge
of
the
reef
and
then
rested
on
their
oars
as
patteson
swung
himself
over
the
side
into
the
cool
water
he
waded
across
the
reef
between
the
hosts
of
savages
and
in
every
hand
was
a
club
or
spear
or
a
wooden
bow
with
an
arrow
ready
to
notch
in
its
bamboo
string
patteson
had
come
to
make
friends
with
them
so
he
entered
a
dark
wattled
house
and
sat
down
to
talk
the
doorway
was
filled
with
the
faces
of
wondering
men
as
he
looked
on
them
a
strange
gleam
of
longing
came
into
his
eyes
and
a
smile
of
great
tenderness
softened
the
strength
of
his
brown
face
the
longing
and
the
tenderness
of
a
shepherd
looking
for
wandering
sheep
who
are
lost
on
the
wild
mountains
of
the
world
then
he
rose
left
the
house
and
went
back
to
the
boat
the
water
was
now
one
seething
cauldron
of
men
walking
splashing
swimming
some
as
patteson
climbed
into
his
boat
caught
hold
of
the
gunwale
and
could
hardly
be
made
to
loosen
their
hold
the
four
young
fellows
in
the
boat
swung
their
oars
and
got
her
under
way
but
they
had
made
barely
half
a
dozen
strokes
when
without
warning
an
arrow
whizzed
through
the
air
into
the
boat
a
cloud
of
arrows
followed
six
canoes
were
now
filled
with
savage
santa
cruzans
who
surrounded
the
boat
and
joined
in
the
shooting
patteson
who
was
in
the
stern
between
his
boys
and
the
bowmen
had
not
shipped
the
rudder
so
he
held
it
up
as
the
boat
shot
ahead
of
the
canoes
to
shield
off
arrows
turning
round
to
see
whither
his
now
rudderless
boat
was
being
pulled
he
saw
that
they
were
heading
for
a
little
bay
in
the
reef
which
would
have
wrecked
their
hopes
of
safety
pull
port
oars
pull
on
steadily
shouted
patteson
and
they
made
for
southern
as
he
called
to
them
he
saw
pearce
the
young
british
sailor
lying
between
the
thwarts
with
the
long
shaft
of
an
arrow
in
his
chest
and
a
young
norfolk
islander
with
an
arrow
under
his
left
eye
the
arrows
flew
around
them
in
clouds
and
suddenly
fisher
young
the
polynesian
whom
he
loved
as
a
son
who
was
pulling
stroke
gave
a
faint
scream
he
was
shot
through
the
left
wrist
look
out
sir
close
to
you
cried
one
of
his
crew
but
the
arrows
were
all
around
him
all
the
way
to
the
schooner
the
canoes
skimmed
over
the
water
chasing
the
boat
the
four
youths
including
the
wounded
pulled
on
bravely
and
steadily
at
last
they
reached
the
ship
and
climbed
on
board
while
the
canoes
fearing
vengeance
from
the
men
on
the
schooner
turned
and
fled
once
aboard
bishop
patteson
knelt
by
the
side
of
pearce
drew
out
the
arrow
which
had
run
more
than
five
inches
deep
into
his
chest
and
bound
up
his
wound
turning
to
fisher
he
found
that
the
arrow
had
gone
through
the
wrist
and
had
broken
off
in
the
wound
taking
hold
of
the
point
of
the
arrow
where
it
stood
out
on
the
lower
side
of
the
wrist
patteson
pulled
it
through
though
the
agony
of
the
boy
was
very
great
the
arrows
were
and
not
poisoned
the
wounds
seemed
to
be
healing
but
a
few
days
later
fisher
said
i
ca
make
out
what
makes
my
jaws
feel
so
stiff
fisher
young
was
the
grandson
of
fierce
foul
pitcairn
island
cannibals
and
was
himself
a
brave
and
pure
christian
lad
he
had
faced
death
with
his
master
many
times
on
coral
reefs
in
savage
villages
on
wild
seas
and
under
the
clubs
of
pacific
islanders
now
he
was
face
to
face
with
something
more
difficult
than
a
swift
and
dangerous
adventure
the
slow
dying
agony
of
lockjaw
he
grew
steadily
worse
in
spite
of
everything
that
patteson
could
do
near
to
the
end
he
said
faintly
kiss
me
i
am
very
glad
i
was
doing
my
duty
tell
my
father
that
i
was
in
the
path
of
duty
and
he
will
be
so
glad
poor
santa
cruz
people
he
spoke
in
that
way
of
the
people
who
had
killed
him
the
young
brown
hero
lies
as
he
would
have
wished
in
the
port
that
was
named
after
the
bishop
whom
he
loved
and
who
was
his
hero
port
patteson
i
loved
him
said
patteson
as
i
think
i
never
loved
anyone
else
fisher
love
to
his
bishop
had
been
that
of
a
youth
to
the
hero
whom
he
worships
but
patteson
had
led
that
brown
islander
still
further
for
he
had
taught
the
boy
to
love
the
hero
of
all
heroes

the
masts
of
the
schooner
southern
swung
gently
to
and
fro
across
the
darkening
sky
as
the
long
calm
rollers
of
the
pacific
slipped
past
her
hull
her
bows
spread
only
a
ripple
of
water
as
the
slight
breeze
bore
her
slowly
towards
the
island
of
nukapu
on
deck
stood
a
group
of
men
their
brown
faces
turned
to
a
tall
bearded
man
as
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
gleamed
on
his
bronze
face
it
kindled
his
brave
eyes
and
showed
the
grave
smile
that
played
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
they
all
looked
on
him
with
that
worship
which
strong
men
give
to
a
hero
who
can
be
both
brave
and
kindly
but
he
wist
not
that
his
face
shone
for
them
patteson
read
to
these
young
men
from
a
book
and
the
words
that
he
read
were
these
and
they
stoned
stephen
calling
upon
god
and
saying
jesus
receive
my
spirit
and
he
knelt
down
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
asleep
when
he
had
spoken
to
them
strongly
on
these
words
and
said
how
it
may
come
to
any
man
who
worships
jesus
to
suffer
so
bishop
patteson
and
all
except
the
man
on
watch
went
to
their
sleep
the
south
sea
island
men
and
the
young
englishman
who
were
there
remembered
all
their
lives
what
patteson
had
said
that
evening
partly
because
these
men
themselves
had
seen
him
brave
such
a
death
as
stephen
again
and
again
and
indeed
they
had
themselves
stood
in
peril
by
his
side
face
to
face
with
threatening
savages
but
even
more
because
of
the
adventure
that
came
to
them
on
the
next
day
at
dawn
they
sighted
land
and
by
eleven
they
were
so
near
that
they
could
see
shimmering
in
the
heat
of
the
midsummer
sun
the
white
beach
of
coral
sand
and
the
drooping
palms
that
make
all
the
island
of
nukapu
green
looking
out
under
their
hands
to
the
island
the
men
aboard
southern
could
see
four
great
canoes
with
their
sails
set
hovering
like
hawks
about
the
circling
reef
which
lay
between
them
and
the
island
on
the
reef
the
blue
waves
beat
and
broke
into
a
gleaming
line
of
cool
white
foam
the
slight
breeze
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
help
the
ship
to
make
the
island
it
was
as
though
she
knew
the
danger
of
that
day
and
would
not
carry
patteson
and
his
men
into
the
perils
that
lay
hidden
behind
the
beauty
of
that
island
of
nukapu
patteson
knew
the
danger
he
knew
that
but
a
little
time
before
their
visit
white
men
had
come
in
a
ship
had
let
down
their
boats
and
rowed
to
the
men
of
the
island
had
pretended
to
make
friends
and
then
shooting
some
and
capturing
others
had
sped
back
to
the
ship
carrying
off
the
captives
to
work
for
them
on
the
island
of
fiji
the
law
of
the
savages
of
the
islands
was
blood
for
blood
and
to
them
all
white
men
belonged
to
one
tribe
the
peril
that
lay
before
patteson
was
that
they
might
attack
him
in
revenge
for
the
foul
crime
of
those
white
traders
just
before
noon
the
order
was
given
to
lower
a
boat
from
southern
patteson
went
down
into
it
and
sat
in
the
stern
while
atkin
his
english
helper
stephen
taroniara
james
minipa
and
john
nonono
came
with
him
to
row
the
boat
swung
toward
the
reef
between
the
reef
and
the
island
lay
two
miles
of
the
blue
and
glittering
lagoon
by
the
time
the
boat
reached
the
reef
six
canoes
full
of
warriors
had
come
together
there
the
tide
was
not
high
enough
to
float
the
boat
across
the
reef
the
nukapuan
natives
said
they
would
haul
the
boat
up
on
to
the
reef
but
the
bishop
did
not
think
it
wise
to
consent
then
two
of
the
savages
said
to
bisipi
as
they
called
the
bishop
will
you
come
into
our
canoe
without
a
moment
hesitation
knowing
that
confidence
was
the
best
way
to
win
them
he
stepped
into
the
canoe
as
he
entered
they
gave
him
a
basket
with
yams
and
other
fruit
in
it
as
the
tide
was
low
the
bishop
and
the
savages
were
obliged
to
wade
over
the
reef
dragging
the
canoe
across
to
the
deeper
lagoon
within
the
boat
crew
of
southern
stopped
in
the
outer
sea
drifting
on
the
tide
with
the
other
four
nukapu
canoes
they
watched
the
bishop
cross
the
lagoon
in
the
canoe
and
land
far
off
upon
the
beach
then
he
went
from
their
sight
the
brown
men
and
the
white
man
in
the
boat
were
trying
to
talk
to
the
islanders
in
the
remaining
canoes
outside
the
reef
when
suddenly
a
savage
jumped
up
in
the
nearest
canoe
not
ten
yards
from
them
and
called
out
in
his
native
language
have
you
anything
like
this
he
drew
his
bow
to
his

and
shot
a
yard
arrow
his
companions
in
the
other
canoes
leapt
to
their
feet
and
sent
showers
of
arrows
whizzing
at
the
men
in
the
boat
shouting
as
they
aimed

patteson
men
were
soon
out
of
range
but
an
arrow
had
nailed
john
nonono
cap
to
his
head
stephen
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
six
arrows
in
his
chest
and
shoulders
atkin
the
white
man
had
one
in
his
left
shoulder
they
reached
the
ship
and
were
helped
on
board
the
arrow
head
was
drawn
out
from
atkin
shoulder
and
was
found
to
be
made
of
a
sharpened
human
bone
no
sooner
was
the
arrow
head
out
than
atkin
leapt
back
into
the
boat
insisting
on
going
back
to
find
patteson
he
alone
knew
how
and
where
the
reef
could
be
crossed
on
the
tide
that
was
now
rising
so
they
got
a
boat
crew
from
the
ship
put
a
beaker
full
of
water
and
some
food
in
the
boat
and
pulled
toward
the
reef
at
four
the
tide
was
high
enough
to
carry
them
across
and
they
rowed
over
looking
through
their
glasses
anxiously
at
the
white
shore
which
was
lined
with
brown
figures
a
canoe
rowed
out
towards
them
bringing
another
canoe
in
tow
as
the
boat
went
towards
the
island
one
canoe
cast
off
the
other
and
went
back
the
second
canoe
drifted
towards
them
slowly
on
the
still
waters
of
the
blue
lagoon
as
it
came
nearer
they
saw
that
in
the
middle
of
it
lay
something
motionless
covered
with
matting
they
pulled
alongside
leaned
over
the
canoe
and
lifted
into
their
boat
the
body
of
patteson
the
empty
canoe
now
drifted
away
a
yell
went
up
from
the
savages
on
the
shore
the
boat
was
pulled
towards
the
ship
and
then
the
body
lifted
up
and
laid
on
the
deck
it
had
been
rolled
in
the
native
matting
as
a
shroud
tied
at
the
head
and
feet
they
unrolled
the
mat
and
there
on
the
face
of
the
dead
bishop
was
still
that
wonderful
patient
and
winning
smile
as
of
one
who
at
the
moment
when
his
head
was
beneath
the
uplifted
club
said
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
and
had
then
fallen
asleep
there
was
a
palm
leaf
fastened
over
his
breast
in
its
long
leaflets
five
knots
were
made
on
the
body
in
the
head
the
side
and
the
legs
were
five
wounds
and
five
men
in
fiji
were
at
work
in
the
plantations
men
captured
from
nukapu
by
brutal
white
traders
it
was
the
vengeance
of
the
savage
the
call
of
blood
for
blood
and
the
death
of
patteson
lies
surely
upon
the
head
of
those
white
traders
who
carried
death
and
captivity
to
the
white
coral
shore
of
nukapu

xii
the
boy
of
the
adventurous
heart
the
born
martyred
the
rain
had
poured
down
in
such
torrents
that
even
the
hardy
boys
of
inverary
in
scotland
had
been
driven
indoors
now
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
sun
was
shining
again
after
the
great
storm
the
boys
were
out
again
and
a
group
of
them
were
walking
toward
the
little
stream
of
aray
which
tumbled
through
the
glen
down
to
loch
fyne
but
the
stream
was
little
no
longer
as
the
boys
came
near
to
the
place
called
the
three
bridges
where
a
rough
wooden
bridge
crossed
the
torrent
they
walked
faster
towards
the
stream
for
they
could
hear
it
roaring
in
a
perfect
flood
which
shook
the
timbers
of
the
bridge
the
great
rainfall
was
running
from
the
hills
through
a
thousand
streamlets
into
the
main
torrent
suddenly
there
came
a
shout
and
a
scream
a
boy
dashed
toward
them
saying
that
one
of
his
schoolmates
had
fallen
into
the
rushing
water
and
that
the
full
spate
of
the
aray
was
carrying
him
away
down
to
the
sea
the
boys
stood
horrified
all
except
one
who
rushed
forward
pulling
off
his
jacket
as
he
ran
leapt
down
the
bank
to
the
lower
side
of
the
bridge
and
clinging
to
the
timber
held
to
it
with
one
arm
while
he
stretched
out
the
other
as
the
drowning
boy
was
being
carried
under
the
bridge
seized
him
and
held
him
tightly
with
his
left
hand
james
chalmers
the
boy
who
had
gone
to
the
rescue
though
only
ten
years
old
could
swim
letting
go
of
the
bridge
while
still
holding
the
other
boy
with
one
arm
he
allowed
the
current
to
carry
them
both
down
to
where
the
branches
hung
over
the
bank
to
the
water
surface
seizing
one
of
these
he
dragged
himself
and
the
boy
toward
the
bank
whence
he
was
helped
to
dry
land
by
his
friends
the
boy
whom
young
james
chalmers
had
saved
belonged
to
a
rival
school
often
the
boys
like
their
fierce
highland
ancestors
who
fought
clan
against
clan
had
attacked
the
boys
of
this
school
and
had
fought
them
james
whose
father
was
a
stonemason
and
whose
mother
was
a
highland
lassie
born
near
loch
lomond
was
the
leader
in
these
battles
but
all
the
fighting
was
forgotten
when
he
heard
that
a
boy
was
in
danger
of
his
life
and
so
he
had
plunged
in
as
swiftly
to
save
him
as
he
would
have
done
for
any
boy
from
his
own
school
we
do
not
hear
that
james
was
clever
at
lessons
in
his
school
but
when
there
was
anything
to
be
done
he
had
the
quickest
hand
the
keenest
eye
the
swiftest
mind
and
the
most
daring
heart
in
all
the
village
though
he
loved
the
hills
and
glens
and
the
mountain
torrent
james
above
everything
else
revelled
in
the
sea
one
day
a
little
later
on
after
the
rescue
of
his
friend
from
drowning
james
stood
on
the
quay
at
inverary
gazing
across
the
loch
and
watching
the
sails
of
the
fishing
boats
when
he
heard
a
loud
cry
he
looked
round
there
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
stood
a
mother
wringing
her
hands
and
calling
out
that
her
child
had
fallen
into
the
water
and
was
drowning
james
ran
along
the
quay
and
taking
off
his
coat
as
he
dashed
to
the
spot
he
dived
into
the
water
and
seizing
the
little
child
by
the
dress
drew
him
ashore
the
child
seemed
dead
but
when
they
laid
him
on
the
quayside
and
moved
his
arms
his
breath
began
to
come
and
go
again
and
the
colour
returned
to
his
cheeks
twice
chalmers
had
saved
others
from
drowning
three
times
he
himself
as
the
result
of
his
daring
adventures
in
the
sea
was
carried
home
supposed
to
be
dead
by
drowning
at
another
time
he
with
two
other
boys
thrust
a
tarred
into
the
sea
from
the
sandy
shore
between
the
two
rocky
points
where
the
western
sea
came
up
the
narrow
loch
fyne
look
at
james
shouted
one
of
the
boys
to
his
companions
as
chalmers
leapt
into
the
box
it
almost
turned
over
and
he
swayed
and
rolled
and
then
steadied
as
the
box
swung
out
from
the
shore
the
other
boys
laughing
and
shouting
towed
him
and
his
boat
through
the
sea
as
they
walked
along
the
shore
suddenly
as
they
talked
they
staggered
forward
the
cord
had
snapped
and
they
fell
on
the
sand
still
laughing
but
when
they
stood
up
again
the
laughter
died
on
their
lips
james
was
being
swiftly
carried
out
by
the
current
to
sea
and
in
a
tarred
he
had
no
paddle
and
his
hands
were
of
no
effect
in
trying
to
move
the
boat
toward
the
shore
the
boys
shouted
there
came
an
answering
cry
from
the
door
of
a
cottage
in
the
village
a
fisherman
came
swinging
down
the
beach
strode
to
his
boat
took
the
two
boys
into
it
and
taking
an
oar
himself
and
giving
the
other
to
the
two
boys
they
pulled
out
with
the
tide
they
reached
james
and
rescued
him
just
as
the
was
sinking
he
went
home
to
the
little
cottage
where
he
lived
and
his
mother
gave
him
a
proper
thrashing
some
of
james
schoolfellows
used
to
go
on
sundays
to
a
school
in
inverary
he
made
up
his
mind
to
join
them
the
class
met
in
the
vestry
of
the
united
presbyterian
church
there
after
their
lesson
they
went
together
into
the
church
to
hear
a
closing
address
meikle
the
minister
who
was
also
superintendent
of
the
school
one
afternoon
took
from
his
pocket
a
magazine
a
copy
of
the
presbyterian
record
from
this
magazine
he
read
a
letter
from
a
brave
missionary
in
the
cannibal
islands
of
fiji
the
letter
told
of
the
savage
life
there
and
of
how
already
the
story
of
jesus
was
leading
the
men
no
longer
to
drag
their
victims
to
the
cannibal
ovens
nor
to
pile
up
the
skulls
of
their
enemies
so
as
to
show
their
own
bravery
the
writer
said
they
were
beginning
happier
lives
in
which
the
awful
terror
of
the
javelin
and
the
club
and
the
horror
of
demons
and
witches
was
gone
when
meikle
had
finished
reading
the
magazine
he
folded
it
up
again
and
then
looked
round
on
all
the
boys
in
the
school
saying
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
boy
here
this
afternoon
who
will
become
a
missionary
and
by
and
by
bring
the
gospel
to
other
such
cannibals
as
those
even
as
the
minister
said
those
words
the
adventurous
heart
of
young
chalmers
leapt
in
reply
as
he
said
to
himself
yes
god
helping
me
i
will
he
was
just
a
freckled
boy
with
hazel
eyes
a
boy
tingling
with
the
joy
of
the
open
air
and
with
the
love
of
the
heave
and
flow
of
the
sea
but
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
a
thing
however
great
the
difficulties
or
dangers
james
usually
carried
it
through
so
it
came
about
that
some
years
later
in
having
been
trained
and
accepted
by
the
london
missionary
society
chalmers
as
a
young
man
walked
across
the
gangway
to
a
fine
new
clipper
ship
it
had
been
christened
after
the
great
hero
missionary
who
gave
up
his
life
on
the
beach
of
erromanga
this
boy
who
loved
the
sea
and
breathed
deep
with
joy
in
the
face
of
adventure
and
peril
had
set
his
face
towards
the
deep
long
breakers
of
the
pacific
he
was
going
to
carry
to
the
south
seas
the
story
of
the
hero
and
saviour
whom
he
had
learnt
to
love
within
the
sound
of
the
atlantic
breakers
that
dashed
and
fretted
against
the
rocks
of
western
scotland

the

of

to
break
the

of
the
mysterious
aivai
river
on
the

were
three
white
people
two
men
and
a
woman
they
were
the
first
who
had
ever
broken
the
silence
of
that
stream
they
gazed
out
under
the
morning
sun
along
the
dead
level
of
the
purari
delta
for
they
had
left
behind
them
the
rolling
breakers
of
the
gulf
of
papua
in
order
to
explore
this
dark
river
away
to
the
south
rolled
the
blue
waters
between
this
vast
island
of
new
guinea
and
northern
australia
they
saw
on
either
bank
the
wild
tangle
of
twisted
mangroves
with
their
roots
higher
than
a
man
twined
together
like
writhing
serpents
they
peered
through
the
thick
bush
with
its
green
leaves
drooping
down
to
the
very
water
edge
but
mostly
they
looked
ahead
over
the
bow
of
the
boat
along
the
water
that
lay
ahead
of
them
dappled
with
sunlight
under
the
trees
for
they
were
facing
an
unknown
district
where
savage
papuans
lived
as
wild
as
hawks
they
did
not
know
what
adventure
might
meet
them
at
the
next
bend
of

cried
one
of
the
white

a
bearded
giant
whose
flashing

and
mass
of
brown
hair
gave
him
the
look
of

lion
we
will
make

bravo
and
he
turned
to
abel
whose
face
lit
up
with
pleasure
at
his
happy
excitement
no
white
man
has
even
seen
the
people
of

said
tamate
for
that
was
the
native
name
given
to
james
chalmers
the
scottish
boy
who
had
now
gone
out
to
papua
as
a
missionary
iko
there
and
he
pointed
to
a
stalwart
papuan
who
stood
by
the
funnel
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
seen
them
and
can
speak
their
tongue
it
is
dangerous
for
your
wife
to
go
among
these
people
he
went
on
turning
to
abel
but
she
will
help
us
more
than
anything
else
possibly
can
to
make
friends
and
abel
nodded
for
he
knew
that
when
the
papuans
mean
to
fight
they
send
their
women
and
children
away
and
that
when
they
saw
abel
they
would
believe
that
the
white
people
came
as
friends
and
not
enemies
as
the
steamer
carried
this
scouting
party
against
the
swift
current
up
the
river
toward
iala
tamate
wanted
to
find
how
far
up
the
river
the
village
lay
so
he
beckoned
iko
to
him
tamate
did
not
know
a
word
of
the
dialect
which
iko
spoke
but
he
had
with
him
an
old
wrinkled
papuan
who
knew
iko
language
and
who
looked
out
with
worshipping
eyes
at
the
great
white
man
who
was
his
friend
so
tamate
wishing
to
ask
iko
how
far
away
the
village
of
iala
was
spoke
first
to
old
vaaburi
and
then
vaaburi
asked
iko
iko
stretched
out
his
dark
forefinger
and
made
them
understand
that
that
finger
meant
the
length
of
their
journey
to
iala
then
with
his
other
hand
he
touched
his
forefinger
under
the
second
joint
to
show
how
far
they
had
travelled
on
their
journey
not
a
third
of
the
distance
hour
after
hour
went
by
as
the
steamer
drove
her
way
through
the
swiftly
running
waters
of
aivai
and
ever
iko
pointed
further
and
further
up
his
finger
until
at
last
they
had
reached
his
nail
by
three
the
middle
of
the
nail
was
reached
the
eyes
of
all
looked
anxiously
ahead
at
every
curve
of
the
river
they
strained
their
sight
to
see
if
iala
were
in
view
how
would
these
savage
people
welcome
the
white
men
and
woman
in
their
snorting
great
canoe
that
had
no
paddles
nor
oars
there
came
a
sharp
bend
in
the
river
and
then
a
long
straight
reach
of
water
lying
between
the
banks
suddenly
iko
called
out
and
tamate
and
and
abel
peered
ahead
the
great
trees
of
the
river
nearly
met
above
their
heads
and
only
a
narrow
strip
of
sky
could
be
seen
there
in
the
distance
were
the
houses
of
iala
close
clustered
on
both
banks
of
the
steaming
river
they
stood
on
piles
of
wood
driven
into
the
mud
like
houses
on
stilts
and
their
bamboo
roofs
stood
out
over
the
river
like
gigantic
slow
shouted
tamate
to
the
engineer
the
slackened
speed
till
she
just
stemmed
the
running
current
and
no
more
it
will
be
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
them
said
tamate
to
his
friends
to
see
this
launch
we
will
give
them
time
to
get
their
wits
together
again
looking
ahead
through
their
glasses
the
white
men
and
abel
could
see
canoes
swiftly
crossing
and
the
river
and
men
rushing
about
full
speed
ahead
cried
tamate
again
and
then
after
a
few
revolutions
of
the
engine
go
slow
it
will
never
do
he
said
to
drop
amongst
them
while
they
are
in
that
state
they
will
settle
down
presently
and
then
as
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
between
the
waving
branches
of
the
giant
trees
we
have
got
a
good
two
hours
daylight
yet
he
said
life
and
death
to
tamate
and
his
friends
hung
in
the
balance
for
they
were
three
people
unarmed
and
here
were
dark
savage
warriors
in
hundreds
everything
depended
on
his
choosing
just
the
right
moment
for
going
into
the
midst
of
these
people
so
he
watched
them
closely
knitting
his
shaggy
eyebrows
together
as
he
measured
their
state
of
mind
by
their
actions
he
was
the
scout
of
christ
in
papua
and
he
must
be
watchful
and
note
all
those
things
that
escape
most
men
but
mean
so
much
to
trained
eyes
tamate
seemed
to
have
a
strange
gift
that
made
him
able
even
where
other
men
could
tell
nothing
to
say
exactly
when
it
was
and
when
it
was
not
possible
to
go
among
a
wild
untouched
tribe
now
the
bewildered
ialan
savages
had
grown
quieter
tamate
called
to
the
engineer
to
drive
ahead
once
more
slowly
the
launch
forged
her
way
through
the
running
waters
and
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
centre
of
iala
there
on
either
side
stood
the
houses
in
long
rows
stretching
up
the
river
and
on
the
banks
hundreds
of
men
stood
silent
and
as
still
as
trees
their
canoes
lay
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
water
ready
for
instant
launching
in
each
canoe
stood
its
crew
erect
and
waiting
all
the
women
and
children
had
been
sent
away
for
these
men
were
out
to
fight
they
did
not
know
whether
this
strange
house
upon
the
water
with
the
smoke
coming
from
its
chimney
was
the
work
of
gods
or
devils
still
they
stood
there
to
face
the
strange
thing
and
if
need
be
to
fight
brown
iko
stood
in
the
bows
of
the
near
him
stood
tamate
then
the
engine
stopped
and
the
anchor
was
dropped
overboard
the
savages
stood
motionless
not
a
weapon
could
be
seen
the
engineer
hearing
the
rattle
through
the
hole
blew
the
in
simple
high
spirits
as
the
shriek
of
the
whistle
echoed
under
the
arches
of
the
trees
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
the
ialan
warriors
swung
their
long
bows
from
behind
their
bodies
without
stooping
each
caught
up
an
arrow
that
stood
between
his
toes
and
with
one
movement
fixed
it
and
pulled
the
bamboo
strings
of
their
black
bows
till
the
notch
of
the
arrows
touched
their
ears
a
hundred
arrows
were
aimed
at
the
hearts
of
tamate
and
and
abel
swiftly
iko
stood
upon
the
bulwark
of
the
and
shouted
just
one
word
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
was
the
ialan
word
for
peace
and
again
he
shouted
it
and
yet
again
peace
peace
then
he
cried
out
pouta
it
was
the
name
of
the
chief
of
these
savages
they
had
but
to
let
the
arrows
from
their
bows
and
all
would
have
been
over
there
was
silence
what
order
would
pouta
give
then
from
the
bank
on
their
right
came
the
sound
of
an
answering
voice
in
a
flash
every
arrow
was
taken
from
its
bow
and
again
not
a
weapon
was
to
be
seen
iko
then
called
out
again
to
pouta
and
tamate
told
iko
what
he
was
to
say
to
his
friend
the
savage
chief
for
some
minutes
the
conversation
went
on
at
last
iko
came
to
the
point
of
asking
for
a
canoe
to
take
them
ashore
chief
pouta
hesitated
then
he
gave
his
command
and
a
large
canoe
was
launched
from
the
bank
into
the
river
and
slowly
paddled
towards
the
as
the
canoe
came
towards
them
tamate
turned
to
abel
who
had
stood
there
without
flinching
with
all
the
arrows
pointed
toward
the
boat
and
he
spoke
words
like
these
your
bravery
is
our
strength
seeing
you
makes
them
believe
that
we
come
for
peace
you
give
them
greater
confidence
in
us
than
all
our
words
by
this
time
the
canoe
had
paddled
alongside
the
launch
tamate
went
over
the
side
first
into
the
canoe
then
abel
then
abel
iko
and
vaaburi
the
canoe
pushed
off
again
and
paddled
toward
the
landing
place
where
a
crowd
of
ialan
savages
filled
every
inch
of
space
as
soon
as
the
bow
of
the
canoe
touched
the
bank
tamate
without
hesitating
a
second
stepped
out
with
iko
together
they
walked
up
to
the
chief
pouta
and
tamate
put
his
arms
around
him
in
an
embrace
of
peace
pouta
standing
on
a
high
place
shouted
to
all
his
warriors
but
none
of
the
white
people
knew
a
word
of
his
meaning
look
where
they
would
in
every
direction
this
white
woman
and
the
two
men
were
completely
surrounded
by
an
unbroken
mass
of
wild
and
armed
savages
who
stood
gazing
upon
the
strange
apparitions
in
their
midst
tamate
without
a
pause
perfectly
calm
and
showing
no
signs
of
fear
spoke
to
pouta
and
his
men
through
old
vaaburi
and
iko
we
have
come
he
said
so
that
we
may
be
friends
we
have
come
without
weapons
we
have
brought
with
us
a
woman
of
our
tribe
for
we
come
in
peace
we
are
strangers
but
we
come
with
great
things
to
tell
some
day
we
will
come
again
and
will
stay
with
you
and
will
tell
you
all
our
message
we
come
only
to
make
friends
then
iko
closed
his
eyes
and
prayed
in
the
language
of
the
people
of
iala
turning
to
his
friends
when
the
prayer
was
over
tamate
said
quietly
now
we
must
get
aboard
as
quickly
as
we
possibly
can
my
plan
for
a
first
visit
is
to
come
make
friends
and
get
away
again
swiftly
when
we
are
gone
they
will
talk
to
one
another
about
us
next
time
we
come
we
shall
meet
friends
so
they
walked
down
through
an
avenue
of
armed
papuans
to
the
bank
and
got
into
the
canoe
again
the
paddles
flashed
as
she
drove
swiftly
through
the
water
toward
the
launch
as
they
climbed
her
side
the
anchor
was
weighed
the
swung
round
her
engines
started
and
carried
down
by
the
swift
stream
she
slipped
past
the
packed
masses
of
silent
men
who
lined
the
banks
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
a
pathfinder
through
a
country
which
no
man
has
penetrated
before
but
it
is
a
greater
thing
to
do
as
these
did
on
their
journey
up
the
aivai
and
find
a
path
of
friendship
into
savage
lives
to
do
that
was
the
greatest
joy
in
tamate
life
for
he
said
when
he
had
spent
many
years
in
this
work
recall
the
years
give
me
back
all
its
experiences
give
me
its
shipwrecks
give
me
its
standings
in
the
face
of
death
give
it
me
surrounded
with
savages
with
spears
and
clubs
give
it
me
back
again
with
spears
flying
about
me
with
the
club
knocking
me
to
the

give

me
back
and
i
will
still
be

about

a
dark
night
and

the

lapping
of
the
waters
on
the
port
moresby
beach
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
immense
island
of

filled
the
air
with
a
quiet
hush
of
expectation
in
a
little
white
house
sat
a
tall
dark
man
with
his
wife
the
man
was
ruatoka
if
you
had
asked
who
is
ruatoka
of
all
the
papuans
for
miles
around
port
moresby
they
would
have
wondered
at
your
ignorance
ruatoka
they
would
have
told
you
was
a
jesus
man
he
walked
among
their
villages
and
did
not
fear
them
when
they
threatened
him
with
spears
and
clubs
he
gave
them
medicines
when
they
were
ill
and
nursed
them
he
spoke
strong
words
to
them
which
made
their
hearts
turn
to
water
within
them
when
he
showed
that
they
did
wrong
he
often
stopped
them
from
fighting
ruatoka
with
his

had
sailed
from
the
south

islands
with
tamate
who
was
to
them
their
great
hero
my
fathers
of
old
were
heathen
savage
men
on
the
island
of
mangaia
he
would
say
the
white
men
came
to
them
and
brought
the
story
of
jesus
now
we
are
happy
but
we
too
must
go
to
the
men
of
new
guinea
just
as
the
white
men
came
to
us
the
new
guinea
papuans
are
savage
cannibals
and
heathen
they
will
know
jesus
and
be
as
happy
as
we
are
so
ruatoka
had
been
trained
as
a
teacher
and
preacher
as
well
as
a
and
carpenter
and
his
wife
was
taught
how
to
teach
children
as
well
as
good
housekeeping
this
was
the
brown
man
ruatoka
who
sat
that
night
in
his
little
house
at
port
moresby
on
the
shore
behind
the
great
reef
of
papua
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
his
door
the
door
opened
and
the
black
frightened
faces
of
papuans
with
staring
eyes
looked
at
him
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
and
they
told
him
that
as
they
came
at
sunset
along
the
path
from
the
people
of
larogi
to
port
moresby
they
found
by
the
side
of
the
path
a
white
man
he
was
dying
they
said
we
were
afraid
to
touch
him
if
we
touched
him
and
he
died
his
ghost
would
haunt
us
for
evermore
ruatoka
stood
up
at
once
and
reached
for
his
lantern
and
turning
to
the
men
said
come
and
guide
me
to
the
place
they
said
no
we
are
afraid
of
the
demon
spirit
it
is
night
the
man
will
die
we
are
afraid
of
the
spirits
we
will
not
go
ruatoka
father
had
told
him
when
he
was
a
boy
how
his
own
people
in
the
years
before
had
dreaded
the
of
mangaia
but
that
he
must
learn
that
there
were
no
spirits
to
be
dreaded
that
one
great
ruled
above
all
and
would
take
care
of
his
children
and
that
all
those
children
must
love
one
another
so
rua
as
they
called
him
knowing
that
the
white
man
who
lay
sick
by
the
roadside
in
the
night
though
of
another
colour
was
yet
a
brother
and
knowing
that
no
demon
spirit
could
harm
him
in
the
dark
lighted
his
lantern
poured
water
into
a
bottle
took
a
long
piece
of
cloth
folded
it
up
and
started
out
under
the
stars
he
walked
for
mile
after
mile
up
steep
hills
and
down
into
valleys
along
the
path
but
nothing
did
he
hear
save
the
cry
of
a
night
bird
at
last
he
had
gone
five
miles
and
was
wondering
whether
he
could
ever
find
the
sick
man
for
the
long
grass
towered
up
on
either
side
and
all
was
still
when
he
heard
a
low
moaning
listening
intently
he
found
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
then
moved
towards
it
he
found
there
at
the
side
of
the
path
a
white
man
named
neville
nearly
dead
he
was
moaning
with
the
pain
of
the
fever
yet
unconscious
taking
his
bottle
ruatoka
poured
a
little
water
down
the
throat
of
the
man
he
then
took
the
long
piece
of
cloth
wound
it
round
neville
took
the
two
ends
in
his
hands
and
stooping
he
pulled
and
strained
with
all
his
great
strength
until
at
last
neville
lay
like
a
sack
upon
his
shoulders
staggering
along
ruatoka
climbed
the
hills
that
rose
feet
high
again
and
again
he
was
bound
to
rest
for
the
man
on
his
shoulders
was
as
heavy
as
ruatoka
himself
he
tottered
down
the
hill
path
and
at
last
just
as
the
first
light
of
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
eastern
hills
ruatoka
staggered
into
his
home
laid
the
sick
man
upon
the
only
bed
he
had
and
then
himself
laid
down
upon
the
floor
wearied
almost
to
death
there
he
slept
while
his
wife
nursed
and
tended
the
neville
back
to
life
over
a
thousand
years
before
that
day
wilfrid
had
brought
life
and
joy
to
the
starving
saxons
of
the
south
coast
of
england
a
hundred
years
before
that
day
white
men
the
of
those
saxons
had
started
out
in
and
sailing
across
the
world
had
taken
life
and
joy
in
the
place
of
the
terror
of
demons
and
the
death
by
the
club
to
the
men
of
the
islands
of
the
seas
now
ruatoka
the
south
sea
islander
having
in
his
heart
the
same
brave
spirit
of
the
good
shepherd
that
spirit
of
the
good
samaritan
of
help
and
preparedness
of
courage
and
of
chivalry
had
carried
life
and
joy
back
to
the
north

briton

had
fallen
by
the
roadside
in
papua

letter
to
a
missionary
who

end

the
letter
hear
my
wish

is
a
great
wish
the
remainder
of
my
strength
i
would
spend
in
the
place
where
tamate
was
killed
in
that
village
i
would
live
in
that
place
where
they
killed
men
jesus
christ

and
his
word
i
would
teach
to
the
people
that
they
may
become

the

who
would
go
on

born
died
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
in
the
hot
african
air
as
two
bronzed
scots
strode
along
the
narrow
forest
path
the
one
a
young
doctor
glanced
quickly
through
the
trees
and
occasionally
turned
aside
to
pick
some
strange
orchid
and
to
slip
it
into
his
collecting
case
the
other
strode
steadily
along
with
that
curious
resolute
forward
tread
of
his
he
was
david
livingstone
behind
them
came
a
string
of
african
bearers
carrying
in
bundles
on
their
heads
the
tents
and
food
of
the
explorers
suddenly
with
a
crunch
livingstone
heel
went
through
a
white
object
half
hidden
in
the
long
grass
a
thing
like
an
ostrich
egg
he
stooped
and
his
strong
bronzed
face
was
twisted
with
mingled
sorrow
and
anger
as
looking
into
the
face
of
his
younger
friend
he
gritted
out
between
his
clenched
teeth
the
again
it
was
the
whitening
skull
of
an
african
boy
for
weeks
those
two
britons
had
driven
their
little
steamer
the
they
called
her
because
of
her
wheezing
engines
up
the
zambesi
river
and
were
now
exploring
its
tributary
the
shiré
each
morning
before
they
could
start
the
ship
engines
they
had
been
obliged
to
take
poles
and
push
from
between
the
paddles
of
the
wheels
the
dead
bodies
of
africans
men

and
children
slain
bodies
which
had
floated
down
from
the
villages

had

and
sacked

was
out
on
the
long
bloody
trail
of
the
slaver
the
trail
that
stretched
on
and
on
into
the
heart
of
africa
where
no
white
man
had
ever
been
this
negro
boy
skull
whitening
on
the
path
was
only
one
more
link
in
the
long
sickening
of
slavery
that
girdled
africa
the
two
men
strode
on
the
forest
path
opened
out
to
a
broad
clearing
they
were
in
an
african
village
but
no
voice
was
heard
and
no
step
broke
the
horrible
silence
it
was
a
village
of
death
the
sun
blazed
on
the
charred
heaps
which
now
marked
the
sites
of
happy
african
homes
the
gardens
were
desolate
and
utterly
destroyed
the
village
was
wiped
out
those
who
had
submitted
were
far
away
trudging
through
the
forest
under
the
lash
of
the
slaver
those
who
had
been
too
old
to
walk
or
too
brave
to
be
taken
without
fight
were
slain
the
heart
of
livingstone
burned
with
one
great
resolve
he
would
track
this
foul
thing
into
the
very
heart
of
africa
and
then
blazon
its
horrors
to
the
whole
world
the
two
men
trudged
back
to
the
river
bank
again
now
with
their
brown
companions
they
took
the
shallow
boat
that
they
had
brought
on
the
deck
of
the
and
headed
still
farther
up
the
shiré
river
from
the
zambesi
toward
the
unknown
highlands
of
central
africa
spears
and
only
the
chant
of
the
africans
as
they
swung
their
paddles
and
the
frightened
shriek
of
a
glittering
parrot
broke
the
stillness
as
the
boat
pushed
northward
against
the
river
current
the
paddles
flashed
again
and
as
the
boat
came
round
a
curve
in
the
river
they
were
faced
by
a
sight
that
made
every
man
sit
paddle
in
hand
motionless
with
horror
the
bank
facing
them
in
the
next
curve
of
the
river
was
black
with
men
the
ranks
of
savages
bristled
with
spears
and
arrows
a
chief
yelled
to
them
to
turn
back
then
a
cloud
of
arrows
flew
over
the
boat
go
on
said
livingstone
quietly
to
the
africans
their
paddles
took
the
water
and
the
boat
leapt
toward
the
savage
on
the
bank
the
water
was
shallower
now
before
any
one
realised
what
was
happening
livingstone
had
swung
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
up
to
his
waist
in
water
was
wading
ashore
with
his
arms
above
his
head
it
is
peace
he
called
out
and
waded
on
toward
the
barbs
of
a
hundred
arrows
and
spears
the
men
in
the
boat
sat
breathless
waiting
to
see
their
leader
fall
with
a
score
of
spears
through
his
body
but
the
savages
on
the
bank
were
transfixed
with
amazement
at
livingstone
sheer
audacity
awed
by
something
in
this
unflinching
and
unarmed
courage
no
finger
let
fly
a
single
arrow
you
think
he
called
to
the
chief
that
i
am
a
for
livingstone
knew
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
wanderings
been
attacked
by
africans
save
where
they
had
first
been
infuriated
by
the
cruel
raiders
the
chief
scowled
see
cried
livingstone
baring
his
arm
to
show
his
white
skin
as
he
again
and
again
had
done
when
threatened
by
africans
is
this
the
colour
of
the
men
who
come
to
make
slaves
and
to
kill
the
savages
gazed
with
astonishment
they
had
never
before
seen
so
white
a
skin
no
livingstone
went
on
this
is
the
skin
of
the
tribe
that
has
heart
toward
the
african
almost
unconsciously
the
man
had
dropped
the
spear
points
and
arrow
heads
as
he
was
speaking
the
chief
listened
while
livingstone
who
was
now
on
the
bank
told
the
savages
how
he
had
come
across
the
great
waters
from
a
land
with
a
message
of
peace
and
goodwill
unarmed
and
with
a
dauntless
heroism
the
white
man
who
would
go
on
had
won
a
great
victory
over
that
tribe
he
now
passed
on
in
his
boat
up
the
river
and
over
rapids
toward
the
wonderful
shining
highlands
in
the
heart
of
africa
deliverance
to
the
captives
kirk
was
recalled
to
england
by
the
british
government
but
livingstone
trudged
on
in
increasing
loneliness
over
mountains
and
across
rivers
and
lakes
plunging
through
marshes
racked
a
score
of
times
with
fever
robbed
of
his
medicines
threatened
again
and
again
by
the
guns
of
the
arabs
and
the
spears
and
clubs
of
savage
bearing
on
his
bent
shoulders
the
cross
of
the
negroes
agony
slavery
till
at
last
alone
and
on
his
knees
in
the
dead
of
night
our
greatheart
crossed
his
last
river
into
the
presence
of
his
father
in
heaven
yet
still
though
his
body
was
dead
his
spirit
would
go
on
for
the
life
livingstone
lived
the
death
he
died
and
the
record
he
wrote
of
the
horrible
cruelties
thrilled
all
britain
to
heal
that
open
sore
of
the
world
queen
victoria
made
kirk
her
consul
at
zanzibar
and
told
him
to
make
the

all

because
of
david
livingstone
through
all
the

of

over
which
he
trod
no

dare
lay
the
shackles

livingstone
saw

may
hear
the

crying

a

asked
a
very
old
african
in
matabeleland
whether
as
a
boy
he
remembered

oh
yes
replied
the
aged
matabele
he
came
into
our
village
out
of
the
bush
walking
thus
and
the
old
man
got
up
and
stumped
along
imitating
the
determined
tread
of
livingstone
which
after
sixty
years
was
the
one
thing
he
remembered
chapter
xvi
the
black
prince
of
africa
dates
the
present
day
one
day
men
came
running
into
a
village
in
south
africa
to
say
that
a
strange
man
whose
body
was
covered
with
clothes
and
whose
face
was
not
black
was
walking
toward
their
homes
he
was
coming
from
the
south
never
before
had
such
a
man
been
seen
in
their
tribe
so
there
was
great
excitement
and
a
mighty
chattering
went
through
the
round
wattle
of
mud
huts
with
their
circular
thatched
roofs
the
african
chief
sekhome
who
was
the
head
of
this
bamangwato
tribe
and
who
was
also
a
noted
started
out
along
the
southward
trail
to
meet
the
white
man
by
his
side
ran
his
eldest
son
he
was
a
lithe
blithe
boy
his
chocolate
coloured
skin
shone
and
the
muscles
rippled
as
he
trotted
along
he
was
so
swift
that
his
name
was
the
name
of
the
antelope
that
gallops
across
the
veldt
cama
is
what
the
bamangwato
call
the
antelope
khama
is
how
we
spell
the
boy
name
he
gazed
in
wonder
as
he
saw
a
sturdy
man
wearing
clothes
such
as
he
had
not
seen
before
what
we
call
coat
and
hat
trousers
and
boots
he
looked
into
the
bronzed
face
of
the
white
man
and
saw
that
his
eyes
and
mouth
were
kind
together
they
walked
back
into
the
village
chief
sekhome
found
that
the
white
man
name
was
david
livingstone
and
that
he
was
a
kind
doctor
who
could
make
boys
and
men
better
when
they
were
ill
with
medicines
out
of
a
black
japanned
box
when
evening
came
the
boy
khama
saw
the
strange
white
man
open
another
box
and
take
out
a
curious
thing
which
seemed
to
open
yet
was
full
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
leaves
khama
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
in
his
life
and
he
could
not
understand
why
livingstone
opened
it
and
kept
looking
at
it
for
a
long
time
for
he
had
never
seen
a
book
before
and
did
not
even
know
what
letters
were
or
what
reading
was
it
seemed
wonderful
to
him
when
he
heard
that
that
book
could
speak
to
livingstone
without
making
any
sound
and
that
it
told
him
about
the
one
infinite
holy
loving
god
who
is
father
of
all
men
black
or
brown
or
white
and
whose
son
jesus
christ
came
to
teach
us
all
to
love
god
and
to
love
one
another
for
the
book
was
the
bible
which
livingstone
all
through
his
heroic
exploring
of
africa
read
each
day
so
livingstone
passed
on
from
the
village
but
this
boy
khama
never
forgot
him
and
in
time
as
we
shall
see
other
white
men
came
and
taught
khama
himself
to
read
that
same
book
and
worship
that
same
god
fight
with
the
meanwhile
strange
adventures
came
to
the
growing
young
khama
this
is
the
story
of
some
of
them
the
leaping
flames
of
a
hunting
threw
upon
the
dark
background
of
thorn
trees
weird
shadows
of
the
men
who
squatted
in
a
circle
on
the
ground
talking
the
men
were
all
africans
the
picked
hunters
from
the
tribe
of
the
bamangwato
they
were
out
on
the
spoor
of
a
great
lion
that
had
made
himself
the
terror
of
the
tribe
night
after
night
the
lion
had
leapt
among
their
oxen
and
had
slain
the
choicest
in
the
chief
herds
again
and
again
the
hunters
had
gone
out
on
the
trail
of
the
ferocious
beast
but
always
they
returned
though
boasting
loudly
of
what
they
would
do
when
they
should
face
the
lion
yes
cried
a
young
bamangwato
hunter
rolling
his
eyes
i
will
slay
e
the
fierce
lion
the
voices
of
the
men
rose
on
the
night
air
as
the
whole
group
declared
that
the
beast
should
ravage
their
herds
no
more
the
whole
group
except
one
this
young
man
tense
face
and
the
keen
eyes
that
glowed
in
the
firelight
showed
his
contempt
for
those
who
swaggered
so
much
and
did
so
little
he
was
khama
the
son
of
sekhome
the
chief
the
wild
flames
gleamed
on
him
as
he
stood
there
full
six
feet
of
tireless
manhood
leaning
on
his
gun
like
a
superb
statue
carved
in
ebony
those
swift
spare
limbs
of
his
that
could
keep
pace
with
a
galloping
horse
gave
him
the
right
to
his
name
khama
the
antelope
the
voices
dropped
and
the
men
rolling
themselves
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
lay
down
and
slept
all
except
one
whose
eyes
watched
in
the
darkness
as
sleeplessly
as
the
stars
when
they
were
asleep
khama
took
up
his
gun
and
went
out
into
the
starry
night
the
night
passed
as
the
first
flush
of
dawn
paled
the
stars
and
the
men
around
the
cold
ashes
of
the
fire
sat
up
they
gazed
in
awed
amazement
for
they
saw
striding
toward
them
their
tall
young
chieftain
and
over
his
shoulders
hung
the
tawny
skin
and
mane
of
a
king
lion
alone
in
the
night
he
had
slain
the
terror
of
the
tribe
the
men
who
had
boasted
of
what
they
meant
to
do
and
had
never
performed
never
heard
khama
either
at
that
time
or
later
make
any
mention
of
this
great
feat
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
great
bamangwato
tribe
looked
at
the
tall
silent
resolute
young
chieftain
and
comparing
him
with
his
crafty
father
sekhome
and
his
treacherous
cowardly
younger
brother
khamane
said
khama
is
our
our
confidence
fight
with
the
the
years
went
by
and
that
fierce
old
villain
sekhome
plotted
and
laid
ambush
against
the
life
of
his
valiant
son
khama
men
who
followed
david
livingstone
into
africa
had
come
as
missionaries
to
his
tribe
and
had
taught
him
the
story
of
jesus
and
given
him
the
knowledge
of
reading
and
writing
so
khama
had
become
a
christian
though
sekhome
his
father
was
still
a
heathen
khama
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
horrible
ceremonies
by
which
the
boys
of
the
tribe
were
initiated
into
manhood
nor
would
he
look
on
the
heathen
incantations
though
his
father
smoked
with
anger
against
him
under
a
thousand
insults
and
threats
of
death
khama
stood
silent
never
insulting
nor
answering
again
and
always
treating
with
respect
his
unnatural
father
you
as
the
son
of
a
great
chief
must
marry
other
wives
said
old
sekhome
whose
wives
could
not
be
numbered
young
khama
firmly
refused
for
the
word
of
god
which
ruled
his
life
told
him
that
he
must
have
but
one
wife
sekhome
foamed
with
futile
rage
you
must
call
in
the
to
make
rain
said
sekhome
as
the
parched
earth
cracked
under
the
flaming
sun
khama
knew
that
their
wild
incantations
had
no
power
to
make
rain
but
that
god
alone
ruled
the
heavens
so
he
refused
sekhome
now
made
his
last
and
most
fearful
attack
he
was
a
and
master
of
the
whose
ghoulish
incantations
made
the
bamangwato
tremble
in
terror
of
unseen
devils
one
night
the
persecuted
khama
woke
at
the
sound
of
strange
clashing
and
chanting
looking
out
he
saw
the
fitful
flame
of
a
fire
going
out
from
his
hut
he
saw
the
or
court
in
front
of
it
lit
up
with
weird
flames
round
which
the
black
wizards
danced
with
horns
and
lions
teeth
clashing
about
their
necks
and
with
manes
of
hair
waving
above
their
horrible
faces
as
they
danced
they
cast
charms
into
the
fire
and
chanted
loathsome
spells
and
terrible
curses
on
khama
as
a
boy
he
had
been
taught
that
these
had
the
power
to
slay
or
to
smite
with
foul
diseases
he
would
have
been
more
than
human
if
he
had
not
felt
a
shiver
of
nameless
dread
at
this
lurid
and
horrible
dance
of
death
yet
he
never
hesitated
he
strode
forward
swiftly
anger
and
contempt
on
his
face
scattering
the
from
his
path
and
leaping
full
upon
their
fire
of
charms
stamped
it
out
and
scattered
its
embers
broadcast
the
wizards
fled
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
fight
with
the
kaffir
at
last
khama
treacherous
old
father
sekhome
died
khama
was
acclaimed
the
supreme
chief
of
all
the
bamangwato
he
galloped
out
at
the
head
of
his
horsemen
to
pursue
lobengula
the
ferocious
chief
of
the
matabele
who
had
struck
fear
into
the
bamangwato
for
many
years
even
lobengula
who
to
his
dying
day
carried
in
his
neck
a
bullet
from
khama
gun
said
of
him
the
bamangwato
are
dogs
but
khama
is
a
man
khama
had
now
freed
his
people
from
the
terror
of
the
lion
the
tyranny
of
and
the
dread
of
the
matabele
yet
the
deadliest
enemy
of
khama
and
the
most
loathsome
tyrant
of
the
bamangwato
was
still
in
power
the
strong
drink
which
degrades
the
african
to
unspeakable
depths
even
as
khama
charged
at
the
head
of
his
men
into
the
breaking
ranks
of
the
matabele
his
younger
brother
khamane
whom
he
had
put
in
charge
of
his
city
in
his
absence
said
to
the
people
you
may
brew
beer
again
now
many
of
the
people
did
not
obey
but
others
took
the
corn
of
the
tribe
and
brewed
beer
from
it
at
night
the
cries
of
beaten
women
rose
and
the
weird
chants
of
incantations
and
of
foul
unclean
dances
were
heard
khamane
called
the
older
men
together
around
his
fire
pots
of
beer
passed
from
hand
to
hand
as
the
men
grew
fuddled
they
became
bolder
and
more
boastful
khamane
then
spoke
to
them
and
said
why
should
khama
rule
you
remember
he
forbids
you
to
make
and
to
drink
beer
he
has
done
away
with
the
dances
of
the
young
men
he
will
not
let
you
make
charms
or
throw
enchanted
dice
or
make
incantations
for
rain
he
is
a
christian
if
i
ruled
you
you
should
do
all
these
things
when
khama
rode
back
again
into
his
town
he
saw
men
and
women
lying
drunk
under
the
eaves
of
their
huts
and
others
reeling
along
the
road
at
night
the
sounds
of
chants
and
drinking
dances
rose
on
the
air
his
anger
was
terrible
for
once
he
lost
his
temper
he
seized
a
burning
torch
and
running
to
the
hut
of
khamane
set
fire
to
the
roof
and
burned
the
house
down
over
his
drunken
brother
head
he
ordered
all
the
beer
that
had
been
brewed
to
be
seized
and
poured
it
out
upon
the
veldt
he
knew
that
he
was
fighting
a
fiercer
enemy
than
the
matabele
a
foe
that
would
throttle
his
tribe
and
destroy
all
his
people
if
he
did
not
conquer
it
the
old
men
of
the
tribe
muttered
against
him
and
plotted
his
death
he
met
them
face
to
face
his
eyes
flashed
when
i
was
still
a
lad
he
said
i
used
to
think
how
i
would
govern
my
town
and
what
kind
of
a
kingdom
it
should
be
one
thing
i
determined
i
would
not
rule
over
a
drunken
town
or
people
i
will
not
have
drink
in
this
town
if
you
must
have
it
you
must
go
fight
with
the
white
man
khama
had
conquered
for
the
moment
but
white
men
englishmen
came
to
the
town
they
set
up
stores
and
in
the
stores
they
began
to
sell
brandy
from
large
casks
the
drinking
of
spirits
has
more
terrible
effects
on
the
african
than
even
on
white
men
once
he
starts
drinking
the
african
can
not
stop
and
is
turned
into
a
sot
the
ships
of
the
white
man
have
been
responsible
to
a
terrible
extent
for
sending
out
the
to
africa
khama
called
the
white
traders
in
the
tribe
together
it
is
my
desire
he
said
that
no
strong
drink
shall
be
sold
in
my
town
we
will
not
bring
the
great
casks
of
brandy
they
replied
but
we
hope
you
will
allow
us
to
have
cases
of
bottles
as
they
are
for
medicine
i
consent
said
khama
but
there
must
be
no
drunkenness
certainly
the
white
men
replied
there
shall
be
no
drunkenness
in
a
few
days
one
of
the
white
traders
had
locked
himself
into
his
house
in
drunken
delirium
naked
and
raving
morning
after
morning
khama
rose
before
daybreak
to
try
and
get
to
the
man
when
he
was
sober
but
all
the
time
he
was
drunk
then
one
morning
this
man
gathered
other
white
men
together
in
a
house
and
they
sat
drinking
and
then
started
fighting
one
another
a
boy
ran
to
khama
to
tell
him
the
chief
went
to
the
house
and
strode
in
the
room
was
a
wreck
the
men
lay
senseless
with
their
white
shirts
stained
with
blood
khama
with
set
stern
face
turned
and
walked
to
the
house
where
he
often
went
for
counsel
the
home
of
his
friend
hepburn
the
missionary
hepburn
lay
ill
with
fever
khama
told
him
what
the
white
men
had
done
hepburn
burned
with
shame
and
anger
that
his
own
should
so
disgrace
themselves
ill
as
he
was
he
rose
and
went
out
with
the
chief
and
saw
with
his
own
eyes
that
it
was
as
khama
said
i
will
clear
them
all
out
of
my
town
cried
the
chief
it
was
saturday
night
decisive
on
the
monday
morning
khama
sent
word
to
all
the
white
men
to
come
to
him
it
was
a
cold
dreary
day
the
chief
sat
waiting
in
the
while
the
white
men
came
together
before
him
hepburn
the
missionary
sat
by
his
side
those
who
knew
khama
saw
as
soon
as
they
looked
into
his
grim
face
that
no
will
on
earth
could
turn
him
from
his
decisions
that
day
you
white
men
he
said
to
them
sternly
have
insulted
and
despised
me
in
my
own
town
because
i
am
a
black
man
if
you
despise
us
black
men
what
do
you
want
here
in
the
country
that
god
has
given
to
us
go
back
to
your
own
country
his
voice
became
hard
with
a
tragic
sternness
i
am
trying
he
went
on
to
lead
my
people
to
act
according
to
the
word
of
god
which
we
have
received
from
you
white
people
and
yet
show
them
an
example
of
wickedness
such
as
we
never
knew
you
and
his
voice
rose
in
burning
scorn
you
the
people
of
the
word
of
god
you
know
that
some
of
my
own
brothers
he
was
referring
to
khamane
especially
have
learned
to
like
the
drink
and
you
know
that
i
do
not
want
them
to
see
it
even
that
they
may
forget
the
habit
yet
you
not
only
bring
it
in
and
offer
it
to
them
but
you
try
to
tempt
with
it
i
make
an
end
of
it
go
take
your
cattle
and
leave
my
town
and
come
back
no
man
moved
or
spoke
they
were
utterly
shamed
and
bewildered
then
one
white
man
who
had
lived
in
the
town
since
he
was
a
lad
pleaded
with
khama
for
pity
as
an
old
friend
you
said
the
chief
with
biting
irony
my
friend
you
the
ringleader
of
those
who
despise
my
laws
you
are
my
worst
enemy
you
pray
for
pity
no
for
you
i
have
no
pity
it
is
my
duty
to
have
pity
on
my
people
over
whom
god
placed
me
and
i
am
going
to
show
them
pity
and
that
is
my
duty
to
them
and
to
god
go
and
they
all
went
then
the
chief
ordered
in
his
young
warriors
and
huntsmen
no
one
of
you
he
said
is
to
drink
beer
then
he
called
a
great
meeting
of
the
whole
town
in
serried
masses
thousand
upon
thousand
the
bamangwato
faced
their
great
chief
he
lifted
up
his
voice
i
khama
your
chief
order
that
you
shall
not
make
beer
you
take
the
corn
that
god
has
given
to
us
in
answer
to
our
prayers
and
you
destroy
it
nay
you
not
only
destroy
it
but
you
make
stuff
with
it
that
causes
mischief
among
you
there
was
some
murmuring
his
eyes
flashed
like
steel
you
can
kill
me
he
said
but
you
can
not
conquer
me
black
prince
of
if
you
rode
as
a
guest
toward
khama
town
over
seventy
years
after
those
days
when
livingstone
first
went
there
as
you
came
in
sight
of
the
great
stone
church
that
the
chief
has
built
you
would
see
tearing
across
the
african
plain
a
whirlwind
of
dust
it
would
race
toward
you
with
the
soft
thunder
of
hoofs
in
the
loose
soil
when
the
horses
were
almost
upon
you
with
a
hand
of
steel
chief
khama
would
rein
in
his
charger
and
his
bodyguard
would
pull
up
behind
him
over
eighty
years
old
grey
and
wrinkled
he
would
spring
from
his
horse
without
help
to
greet
you
still
khama
the
antelope
old
as
he
is
he
is
as
alert
as
ever
he
heard
that
a
great
all
africa
aeroplane
route
was
planned
after
the
great
war
at
once
he
offered
to
make
a
great
aerodrome
and
the
day
at
last
came
when
khama
years
old
who
had
seen
livingstone
the
first
white
man
to
visit
his
tribe
stood
watching
the
first
aeroplane
come
bringing
a
young
officer
from
the
clouds
he
stands
there
the
splendid
chief
of
the
bamangwato
he
is
the
black
prince
of
africa
who
has
indeed
won
his
spurs
against
the
enemies
of
his
people
and
if
you
were
to
ask
him
the
secret
of
the
power
by
which
he
has
done
these
things
khama
the
silent
who
is
not
used
to
boasting
would
no
doubt
lead
you
at
dawn
to
the
before
his
huts
there
at
every
sunrise
he
gathers
his
people
together
for
their
morning
prayers
at
the
feet
of
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
captain
and

the
when
david
livingstone
lay
dying
in
his
hut
in
the
heart
of
africa
with
his
black
companions
susi
and
chumah
attending
him
almost
his
last
words
were
how
far
away
is
the
luapula
he
knew
that
the
river
to
which
the
africans
gave
that
name
was
only
a
short
distance
away
and
that
it
flowed
northward
he
thought
that
it
might
be
the
upper
reaches
of
the
nile
which
had
been
sought
by
men
through
thousands
of
years
but
which
none
had
ever
explored
livingstone
died
in
that
hut
and
never
knew
what
stanley
following
in
his
footsteps
discovered
later
that
the
luapula
was
really
the
upper
stretch
of
the
congo
the
second
largest
river
in
the
world
miles
long
flowing
into
the
atlantic
the
basin
of
the
congo
would
cover
the
whole
of
europe
from
the
black
sea
to
the
english
channel
in
the
year
when
livingstone
died
and
before
stanley
started
to
explore
the
congo
a
young
man
who
had
been
thrilled
by
reading
the
travels
of
livingstone
sailed
to
the
west
coast
of
africa
to
the
kameruns
his
name
was
george
grenfell
a
cornish
boy
born
at
sancreed
four
miles
from
penzance
in
england
who
was
brought
up
in
birmingham
he
was
apprenticed
at
fifteen
to
a
firm
of
hardware
and
machinery
dealers
here
he
picked
up
as
a
lad
some
knowledge
of
machinery
that
helped
him
later
on
the
congo
he
had
been
thrilled
to
meet
at
bristol
college
where
he
was
trained
for
his
missionary
work
a
thin
worn
heroic
man
of
tried
steel
alfred
saker
the
great
kamerun
missionary
and
grenfell
leapt
for
joy
to
go
out
to
the
dangerous
west
coast
of
africa
where
he
worked
hard
teaching
the
africans
to
make
tables
and
bricks
and
to
print
and
read
healing
them
and
preaching
to
them
when
stanley
came
down
the
congo
to
the
sea
and
electrified
the
world
by
the
story
of
the
great
river
grenfell
and
the
baptist
missionary
society
which
he
served
conceived
the
daring
and
splendid
plan
of
starting
a
chain
of
mission
stations
right
from
the
mouth
of
the
congo
eastward
across
africa
in
grenfell
was
on
his
way
up
the
river
travelling
along
narrow
paths
flanked
by
grass
often
fifteen
feet
high
and
crossing
swamps
and
rivers
till
after
thirteen
attempts
and
in
eighteen
months
he
reached
stanley
pool
february
a
thousand
miles
of
river
lay
between
stanley
pool
and
stanley
falls
and
even
above
stanley
falls
lay
thirteen
hundred
miles
of
navigable
river
canoes
were
perilous
hippopotami
upset
them
and
men
were
dragged
down
and
eaten
by
crocodiles
they
must
have
a
steamer
right
up
there
beyond
the
falls
in
the
very
heart
of
africa
grenfell
went
home
to
england
and
the
steamer
was
built
on
the
thames
grenfell
watching
everything
being
made
from
the
crank
to
the
funnel
she
was
built
launched
and
tried
on
the
thames
then
taken
to
pieces
and
packed
in
packages
weighing
lbs
each
and
taken
to
the
mouth
of
the
congo
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
a
thousand
men
the
whole
ship
and
the
food
of
the
party
were
carried
past
the
rapids
over
a
thousand
miles
along
narrow
paths
in
peril
of
snakes
and
leopards
and
enemy
savages
over
streams
crossed
by
bridges
of
through
swamps
across
ravines
grenfell
engineer
who
was
to
have
put
the
ship
together
died
at
last
they
reached
stanley
pool
grenfell
with
eight
negroes
started
to
try
to
build
the
ship
it
was
a
tremendous
task
grenfell
said
the
was
prayed
together
it
was
prayer
and
hard
work
and
gumption
at
last
the
ship
was
launched
steam
was
up
the
began
to
move

she
lives
shouted
the
excited
africans
a
thousand
thrilling
adventures
came
to
him
as
he
steamed
up
and
down
the
river
teaching
and
preaching
often
in
the
face
of
poisoned
arrows
and
spears
we
are
now
going
to
hear
the
story
of
one
adventure
steamer
the
crocodiles
drowsily
dosing
in
the
slime
of
the
congo
river
bank
stirred
uneasily
as
a
strange
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
blazing
african
morning
they
lifted
their
heavy
jaws
and
swung
their
heads
down
stream
their
beady
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
thing
mightier
than
a
thousand
crocodiles
it
was
pushing
its
way
slowly
up
stream
the
sound
was
the
throb
of
the
screw
of
the
steamer
from
whose
funnel
a
light
ribbon
of
smoke
floated
across
the
river
an
awning
shaded
the
whole
deck
from
bow
to
stern
on
the
top
of
the
awning
under
a
little
square
canopy
stood
a
tall
young
negro
the
muscles
in
his
sturdy
arms
and
his
broad
shoulders
rippled
under
his
dark
skin
as
the
wheel
swung
round
in
his
swift
strong
hands
the
steamer
drove
up
stream
while
the
crocodiles
startled
by
the
wash
of
the
boat
slid
sullenly
down
the
bank
and
dived
a
short
bearded
man
dressed
in
white
duck
stood
on
deck
at
the
bows
where
the
steamer
name
was
painted
he
was
george
grenfell
his
keen
eyes
gleamed
through
the
spectacles
that
rested
on
his
strong
arched
nose
by
his
side
stood
his
wife
looking
out
up
the
river
they
were
searching
for
the
and
the
of
some
friendly
town
at
last
as
the
bows
swung
round
the
next
bend
in
the
river
they
saw
a
village
the
africans
rushed
to
the
bank
and
hurriedly
pushed
out
their
canoes
grenfell
shouted
an
order
a
bell
rang
the
screw
stopped
and
the
steamer
while
he
climbed
down
into
the
ship
canoe
and
was
paddled
ashore
the
wondering
people
pushed
and
jostled
around
them
to
see
this
strange
man
with
his
white
face
slave
as
they
walked
up
among
the
huts
speaking
with
the
men
of
the
town
grenfell
came
to
an
open
space
as
his
quick
eyes
looked
about
he
saw
two
little
girls
standing
bound
with
cords
they
were
tethered
like
goats
to
a
stake
their
little
faces
and
round
eyes
looked
all
forlorn
even
the
wonder
of
the
strange
bearded
white
man
hardly
kept
back
the
tears
that
filled
their
eyes
what
are
these
he
asked
turning
to
the
chief
the
african
pointed
up
the
river
grenfell
heart
burned
in
him
as
the
chief
told
how
he
and
his
men
had
swept
up
the
river
in
their
canoes
armed
with
their
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
and
had
raided
another
tribe
and
these
said
the
chief
pointing
to
the
girls
who
began
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
these
are
two
girls
that
we
captured
they
are
some
of
our
booty
they
are
slaves
they
are
tied
there
till
someone
will
come
and
buy
them
grenfell
could
not
resist
the
silent
call
of
their
woeful
faces
quickly
he
gave
beads
and
cloth
to
the
chief
and
took
the
little
girls
back
with
him
down
to
the
river
bank
as
they
jumped
into
the
canoe
to
go
aboard
the
the
two
girls
wondered
what
this
strange
new
master
would
do
with
them
would
he
be
cruel
yet
his
eyes
looked
kind
through
those
funny
round
shining
things
balanced
on
his
nose
the
girls
at
once
forgot
all
their
sorrows
when
they
jumped
on
board
this
wonderful
river
monster
they
felt
it
shiver
and
throb
and
begin
to
move
the
bank
went
farther
and
farther
away
the
had
again
started
up
stream
the
girls
stood
in
wonder
and
gazed
with
open
eyes
as
the
banks
slid
past
they
saw
the
birds
all
green
and
red
flashing
along
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
huge
hippopotami
sullenly
plunging
into
the
river
like
the
floating
islands
of
earth
that
sail
down
the
congo
their
quick
eyes
noted
the
quaint
iguana
like
giant
lizards
sunning
themselves
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
over
the
stream
and
then
dropping
like
stones
into
the
stream
as
the
steamer
passed
slave
girl
then
suddenly
as
they
came
round
a
bend
in
the
river
all
was
changed
there
ahead
grenfell
saw
a
river
town
the
canoes
were
being
manned
rapidly
by
warriors
the
bank
bristled
with
spears
in
the
hands
of
ferocious
savages
whose
faces
were
made
horrible
by
gashes
and
loathsome
tattooing
in
each
canoe
men
stood
with
bows
in
their
hands
and
arrows
drawn
to
the
head
the
throb
of
the
engines
ceased
the
ship
slowed
up
but
the
canoes
came
on
the
men
of
this
congo
town
only
knew
one
thing
enemies
had
only
a
few
weeks
earlier
come
from
had
raided
their
town
burned
their
huts
killed
many
of
their
braves
and
carried
away
their
children
here
were
men
who
had
also
come
from
down
the
river
they
must
therefore
be
enemies
their
chief
shouted
an
order
in
an
instant
a
score
of
spears
hurtled
at
the
ship
and
rattled
on
the
steel
screens
around
the
deck
the
yell
of
the
of
the
tribe
echoed
and
down
the
river
grenfell
was
standing
by
the
little
girls
suddenly
one
of
them
with
dancing
eyes
shouted
and
waved
her
arms
what
is
it
cried
grenfell
to
her
see
see
she
cried
pointing
to
a
warrior
in
a
canoe
who
was
just
poising
a
spear
that
is
my
brother
that
is
my
brother
this
is
my
town
call
to
him
said
grenfell
her
thin
childish
voice
rang
out
but
no
one
heard
it
among
the
warriors
again
she
cried
out
to
her
brother
the
only
answer
was
a
hail
of
spears
and
arrows
grenfell
turned
rapidly
and
shouted
an
order
to
the
engineer
instantly
a
shriek
more
wild
and
piercing
than
the
combined
yells
of
the
whole
tribe
rent
the
air
again
the
shriek
went
up
the
warriors
stood
transfixed
with
spear
and
arrow
in
hand
like
statues
in
ebony
there
was
a
moment
intense
and
awful
silence
they
had
never
before
heard
the
whistle
of
a
steamer
shout
again
quickly
whispered
grenfell
to
the
little
african
girl
in
a
second
the
child
shrill
voice
rang
out
in
the
silence
across
the
water
crying
first
her
brother
name
and
then
her
own
the
astonished
warrior
dropped
his
spear
caught
up
his
paddle
and
in
a
few
swift
strokes
drove
his
canoe
towards
the
steamer
his
astonishment
at
seeing
his
sister
aboard
overcame
all
his
dread
of
this
shrieking
floating
island
that
moved
without
sails
or
paddles
quickly
she
told
her
story
of
how
the
strange
white
man
in
the
great
canoe
that
smoked
had
found
her
in
the
village
of
their
enemies
had
saved
her
from
slavery
and
now
had
brought
her
safely
home
again
the
story
passed
from
lip
to
lip
every
spear
and
bow
and
arrow
was
dropped
the
girls
were
quickly
put
ashore
and
as
grenfell
walked
up
the
village
street
every
warrior
who
had
but
a
few
moments
before
been
seeking
his
blood
was
now
gazing
at
this
strange
friend
who
had
brought
back
to
the
tribe
the
daughters
whom
they
thought
they
had
lost
for
ever
grenfell
went
on
with
his
work
in
face
of
fever
fighting
the
horrors
of
wife
and
at
funerals
and
in
some
ways
worse
still
the
horrible
cruelties
of
the
belgian
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
june
accompanied
by
his
negro
companions
he
lay
at
yalemba
sick
with
fever
two
of
the
africans
wrote
a
letter
for
help
to
other
missionaries
we
are
very
sorrow
they
wrote
because
out
master
is
very
sick
so
now
we
beging
you
one
of
you
let
him
come
to
help
mr
grenfell
please
we
think
now
is
near
to
die
but
we
do
know
how
to
do
with
him
yours
disasi
makulo
mascoo
luvusu
all
up
the
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
congo
waterway
the
power
of
the
work
done
by
grenfell
and
the
men
who
came
with
him
and
after
him
has
changed
all
the
life
gone
are
the
the
wars
the
cruelties
of
the
white
men
along
that
line
there
stand
instead
negroes
who
cap
make
bricks
build
houses
turn
a
lathe
engineers
printers
bookbinders
blacksmiths
carpenters
worshipping
in
churches
built
with
their
own
hands
but
beyond
and
among
the
myriad
tributaries
and
the
vast
forests
millions
of
men
have
never
yet
even
heard
of
the
love
of
god
in
jesus
christ
and
still
work
their
hideous
cruelties
so
grenfell
like
livingstone
opened
a
door
it
stands
open
chapter
xviii
a
man
who
can
turn
his
hand
to
anything
dates
the
inquisitive
village
folk
stared
over
their
garden
gates
at
mackay
the
minister
of
the
free
kirk
of
rhynie
a
small
aberdeenshire
village
as
he
stood
with
his
boy
gazing
into
the
road
at
their
feet
the
father
was
apparently
scratching
at
the
stones
and
dust
with
his
stick
the
villagers
shook
their
heads
fat
the
minister
glowerin
at
wi
his
loon
alic
among
the
stoor
o
the
turnpike
asked
the
villagers
of
one
another
the
minister
certainly
was
powerful
in
the
pulpit
but
his
ways
were
more
than
they
could
understand
he
was
for
ever
hammering
at
the
rocks
on
the
moor
and
lugging
ugly
lumps
of
useless
stone
homeward
containing
fossils
as
he
called
them
now
mackay
was
standing
looking
as
though
he
were
trying
to
find
something
that
he
had
lost
in
the
road
if
they
had
been
near
enough
to
alec
and
his
father
they
would
have
heard
words
like
these
you
see
alec
this
is
the
zambesi
river
running
down
from
the
heart
of
africa
into
the
indian
ocean
and
here
running
into
the
zambesi
from
the
north
is
a
tributary
the
shiré
livingstone
going
up
that
river
found
wild
savages
who
so
the
father
was
tracing
in
the
dust
of
the
road
with
the
point
of
his
stick
the
course
of
the
zambesi
which
livingstone
had
just
explored
for
the
first
time
on
these
walks
with
his
father
alec
with
his
blue
eyes
wide
open
used
to
listen
to
stories
like
the
yarn
we
have
read
of
the
marvellous
adventures
of
livingstone
sometimes
mackay
would
stop
and
draw
triangles
and
circles
with
his
stick
then
alec
would
be
learning
a
problem
in
euclid
on
this
strange
blackboard
of
the
road
he
learned
the
euclid
but
he
preferred
the
zambesi
and
livingstone
one
day
alec
was
off
by
himself
trudging
down
the
road
with
a
fixed
purpose
in
his
mind
a
purpose
that
seemed
to
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
either
africa
or
euclid
he
marched
away
from
his
little
village
of
rhynie
where
the
burn
runs
around
the
foot
of
the
great
granite
mountain
across
the
strath
he
trudged
on
for
four
miles
then
he
heard
a
shrill
whistle
would
he
be
late
after
all
he
ran
swiftly
toward
the
little
railway
station
a
ribbon
of
smoke
showed
over
the
cutting
away
to
the
right
alec
entered
the
station
and
ran
to
one
end
of
the
platform
as
the
train
slowed
down
and
the
engine
stopped
just
opposite
where
he
stood
he
gazed
at
the
driver
and
his
mate
on
the
footplate
he
followed
every
movement
as
the
driver
came
round
the
engine
with
his
and
opened
and
shut
small
brass
lids
and
felt
the
bearings
with
his
hand
to
see
whether
they
were
hot
the
guard
waved
his
green
flag
the
whistle
of
the
engine
shrieked
and
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
along
the
burnside
toward
huntly
alec
gazed
down
the
line
till
the
train
was
out
of
sight
and
then
turning
left
the
station
and
trudged
homeward
when
he
reached
rhynie
he
had
walked
eight
miles
to
look
at
a
railway
engine
for
two
and
a
half
minutes
and
he
was
happy
as
he
went
along
the
village
street
he
heard
a
familiar
sound
clang
ssssssss
it
was
irresistible
he
stopped
and
stepped
into
the
magic
cavern
of
darkness
gleaming
with
the
where
george
lobban
the
smith
having
hammered
a
glowing
horseshoe
into
shape
gripped
it
with
his
pincers
and
flung
it
hissing
into
the
water
having
cracked
a
joke
with
the
laughing
smith
alec
dragged
himself
away
from
the
smithy
past
the
green
and
looked
in
at
the
stable
to
the
pony
and
enjoy
feeling
the
little
beast
muzzle
nosing
in
his
hand
for
oats
he
let
himself
into
the
manse
and
ran
up
to
his
where
he
began
to
print
off
some
pages
that
he
had
set
up
on
his
little
printing
press
at
supper
his
mother
looked
sadly
at
her
boy
with
his
dancing
eyes
as
he
told
her
about
the
wonders
of
the
railway
engine
in
her
heart
she
wanted
him
to
be
a
minister
and
she
did
not
see
any
sign
that
this
boy
would
ever
become
one
this
lad
of
hers
who
was
always
running
off
from
his
books
to
peer
into
the
furnaces
of
the
gas
works
or
to
tease
the
village
carpenter
into
letting
him
plane
a
board
or
to
sit
with
chin
in
hands
and
elbows
on
knees
watching
the
saddler
cutting
and
padding
and
stitching
his
leather
or
to
creep
into
the
like
the
budge
and
toddy
whose
lives
he
had
read
to
see
weels
go
wound
it
was
a
bitter
cold
night
in
the
christmas
vacation
fourteen
years
later
alec
mackay
now
a
young
engineering
student
was
lost
to
all
sense
of
time
as
he
read
of
the
hairbreadth
escapes
and
adventures
told
by
the
african
explorer
stanley
in
his
book
i
found
he
read
these
words
of
stanley
for
four
months
and
four
days
i
lived
with
livingstone
in
the
same
house
or
in
the
same
boat
or
in
the
same
tent
and
i
never
found
a
fault
in
him
each
day
life
with
him
added
to
my
admiration
for
him
his
gentleness
never
forsakes
him
his
hopefulness
never
deserts
him
his
is
the
spartan
heroism
the
inflexibility
of
the
roman
the
enduring
resolution
of
the
the
man
has
conquered
me
alexander
mackay
put
down
stanley
book
and
gazed
into
the
fire
since
the
days
when
he
had
trudged
as
a
boy
down
to
the
station
to
see
the
railway
engine
he
had
been
a
schoolboy
in
the
grammar
school
at
aberdeen
and
a
student
in
edinburgh
and
while
there
had
worked
in
the
great
shipbuilding
yards
at
leith
amid
the
clang
and
roar
of
the
rivetters
and
the
engine
shop
he
was
now
studying
in
berlin
drawing
the
designs
of
great
engines
far
more
wonderful
than
the
railway
engine
he
had
almost
worshipped
as
a
boy
on
the
desk
at
mackay
side
lay
his
diary
in
which
he
wrote
his
thoughts
in
that
diary
were
the
words
that
he
himself
had
written
this
day
last
year
livingstone
died
a
scotsman
and
a
christian
loving
god
and
his
neighbour
in
the
heart
of
africa
thou
and
do
likewise
mackay
wondered
could
it
ever
be
that
he
would
go
into
the
heart
of
africa
like
livingstone
it
seemed
impossible
what
was
the
good
of
an
engineer
among
the
lakes
and
forests
of
central
africa
on
the
table
by
the
side
of
stanley
i
found
lay
a
newspaper
the
edinburgh
mackay
glanced
at
it
then
he
snatched
it
up
and
read
eagerly
a
letter
which
appeared
there
it
was
a
new
call
to
central
africa
the
call
through
stanley
from
king
of
uganda
that
home
of
massacre
and
torture
these
are
some
of
the
words
that
stanley
wrote
king
of
uganda
has
been
asking
me
about
the
white
god
oh
that
some
practical
missionary
would
come
here
would
give
him
anything
that
he
desired
houses
land
cattle
ivory
it
is
the
practical
christian
who
can
cure
their
diseases
build
dwellings
teach
farming
and
turn
his
hand
to
anything
like
a
sailor
this
is
the
man
who
is
wanted
such
a
one
if
he
can
be
found
would
become
the
saviour
of
africa
stanley
called
for
a
practical
man
who
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
he
can
be
the
words
burned
their
way
into
mackay
very
soul
if
he
can
be
found
why
here
here
in
this
very
room
he
sits
the
boy
who
has
worked
in
the
village
at
the
carpenter
bench
and
the
saddler
table
in
the
smithy
and
the
mill
when
his
mother
wished
him
to
be
at
his
books
the
lad
who
has
watched
the
ships
building
in
the
docks
of
aberdeen
and
has
himself
with
hammer
and
file
and
lathe
built
and
made
machines
in
the
engineering
works
he
is
here
the
man
who
can
turn
his
hand
to
anything
and
he
had
we
remember
already
written
in
his
diary
livingstone
died
a
scotsman
and
a
christian
loving
god
and
his
neighbour
in
the
heart
of
africa
thou
and
do
likewise
mackay
did
not
hesitate
then
and
there
he
took
pen
and
ink
and
paper
and
wrote
to
london
to
the
church
missionary
society
which
was
offering
in
the
daily
paper
that
lay
before
him
to
send
men
out
to
king
the
words
that
mackay
wrote
were
these
my
heart
burns
for
the
deliverance
of
africa
and
if
you
can
send
me
to
any
one
of
those
regions
which
livingstone
and
stanley
have
found
to
be
groaning
under
the
curse
of
the
i
shall
be
very
glad
within
four
months
mackay
with
some
other
young
missionaries
who
had
volunteered
for
the
same
great
work
was
standing
on
the
deck
of
the
as
she
steamed
out
from
southampton
for
zanzibar
he
was
in
the
footsteps
of
livingstone
a
scotsman
and
a
christian
making
for
the
heart
of
africa
and
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
anything
for
the
sake
of
him
who
as
the
carpenter
of
nazareth
made
common
things
for
god

mackay
with
his
companions
and
bearers
started
on
his
tramp
of
hundreds
of
miles
along
narrow
footpaths
often
through
swamps
delayed
by
fierce
greedy
chiefs
who
demanded
many
cloths
before
they
would
let
the
travellers
pass
one
of
the
little
band
of
missionaries
had
already
died
of
fever
when
hundreds
of
miles
from

coast
mackay
was
stricken
with
fever
and
nearly
died
his
companions
sent
him
back
to
the
coast
again
to
recover
and
they
themselves
went
on
and
put
together
the
the
boat
which
the
bearers
had
carried
in
sections
on
their
heads
on
the
shore
of
victoria
nyanza
so
mackay
racked
with
fever
was
carried
back
by
his
africans
over
the
weary
miles
through
swamp
and
forest
to
the
coast
at
last
he
was
well
again
and
with
infinite
labour
he
cut
a
great
wagon
road
for
miles
to
mpapwa
with
pick
and
shovel

and
saw
they
cleared
the
road
of
trees

sat
at
night

certainly
yet
be
a
highway

thousand

mackay
reached
the
southern
shore
of
victoria
nyanza
at
kagei
to
find
that
his
surviving
companions
had
gone
on
to
uganda
in
an
arab
leaving
on
the
shore
the
which
had
been
too
small
to
carry
them
on
the
beach
by
the
side
of
that
great
inland
sea
victoria
nyanza
in
the
heart
of
africa
mackay
found
the
now
broken
and
leaking
her
cedar
planks
were
twisted
and
had
warped
in
the
blazing
sun
till
every
seam
gaped
a
hippopotamus
had
crunched
her
bow
between
his
terrible
jaws
many
of
her
timbers
had
crumbled
before
the
still
greater
foe
of
the
african
the
white
ant
now
under
her
shadow
lay
the
man
who
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
on
his
back
with
hammer
and
chisel
in
hand
he
was
rivetting
a
plate
of
copper
on
the
hull
of
the
already
he
had
nailed
sheets
of
zinc
and
lead
on
stern
and
bow
and
had
driven
cotton
wool
picked
from
the
bushes
by
the
lake
into
the
seams
to
caulk
some
of
the
leaks
around
the
boat
stood
crowds
of
africans
their
dark
faces
full
of
astonishment
at
the
white
man
mending
his
big
canoe
why
should
a
man
toil
so
terribly
hard
they
wondered
the
tribesmen
of
the
lake
had
only
canoes
hollowed
out
from
a
or
made
of
some
planks
sewn
together
with
fibres
from
the
banana
tree
at
last
mackay
had
his
boat
ready
to
sail
up
the
victoria
nyanza
the
whole
of
the
length
of
that
great
sea
itself
larger
than
his
own
native
scotland
still
separated
mackay
from
the
land
of
uganda
for
which
he
had
left
britain
over
fifteen
months
earlier
all
through
his
disappointments
and
difficulties
mackay
fought
on
with
him
as
with
livingstone
nothing
had
power
to
break
his
spirit
or
quench
his
burning
determination
to
carry
on
his
plan
to
serve
africa
every
use
of
saw
and
hammer
and
chisel
every
trick
of
the
tool
true
trade
all
the
training
in
the
shipbuilding
yards
and
engineering
shops
at
edinburgh
and
in
germany
helped
mackay
to
invent
some
new
daring
and
ingenious
way
out
of
every
fresh
difficulty
wreck
of
the
daisy
now
at
last
the
was
on
the
water
again
and
mackay
and
his
bearers
went
aboard
and
hoisting
sail
from
kagei
ran
northward
before
they
had
gone
far
black
storm
clouds
swept
across
the
sky
night
fell
lightning
blazed
unceasingly
and
flung
up
into
silhouette
the
wild
outlines
of
the
mountains
to
the
east
the
roar
of
the
thunder
echoed
above
the
wail
of
the
wind
and
the
threshing
of
the
waves
all
through
the
dark
mackay
and
those
of
his
men
who
could
handle
an
oar
rowed
unceasingly
again
and
again
he
threw
out
his
line
but
in
vain
he
made
out
a
dim
line
of
precipitous
cliffs
yet
the
water
seemed
fathomless
the
only
map
in
existence
was
a
rough
one
that
stanley
had
made
at
last
the
lead
touched
bottom
at
fourteen
fathoms
in
the
dim
light
of
dawn
they
rowed
and
sailed
toward
a
shady
beach
before
the
cliffs
and
anchored
in
three
and
a
half
fathoms
of
water
the
storm
passed
but
the
waves
from
the
open
sea
came
roaring
in
and
broke
over
the
the
bowsprit
dipped
under
the
anchor
chain
and
the
whole
bulwark
on
the
weatherside
was
carried
away
the
next
sea
swept
into
the
open
and
now
sinking
boat
by
frantic
efforts
they
heaved
up
the
anchor
and
the
next
wave
swung
the
with
a
crash
onto
the
beach
where
the
waves
pounded
her
to
a
complete
wreck
wrenching
the
planks
from
the
keel
but
mackay
and
his
men
managed
to
rescue
her
cargo
before
she
went
to
pieces
they
were
wrecked
on
a
shore
where
stanley
the
great
explorer
had
years
before
had
a
hairbreadth
escape
from
massacre
at
the
hands
of
the
wild
savages
but
stanley
living
up
to
the
practice
he
had
learned
from
livingstone
had
turned
enemies
into
friends
and
now
the
natives
made
no
attack
on
the
shipwrecked
mackay
for
eight
weeks
mackay
laboured
there
hard
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
living
on
the
beach
in
a
tent
made
of
spars
and
sails
with
hammer
and
chisel
and
saw
he
worked
unsparingly
at
his
task
he
cut
the
middle
eight
feet
from
the
boat
and
bringing
her
stern
and
stem
together
patched
the
broken
ends
with
wood
from
the
middle
part
after
two
months
work
the
now
dumpier
took
the
water
again
and
carried
mackay
and
his
men
safely
up
the
long
shores
of
victoria
nyanza
to
the
goal
of
all
his
travelling
the
capital
of
king
of
uganda
the
rolling
tattoo
of
drums
filled
the
royal
of
king
as
the
great
tyrant
entered
with
his
chiefs
his
dark
cruel
heavy
face
in
vivid
contrast
with
his
spotless
white
robe
sat
heavily
down
on
his
stool
of
state
while
brazen
trumpets
sent
to
him
from
england
blared
as
mackay
entered
the
chiefs
squatted
on
low
stools
and
on
the
before
the
king
at
his
side
stood
his
prime
minister
the
katikiro
a
smaller
man
than
the
king
but
swifter
and
more
the
katikiro
was
dressed
in
a
arab
gown
covered
by
a
black
mantle
trimmed
with
gold
in
his
hard
guilty
face
treacherous
cunning
and
masterful
cruelty
were
blended
was
gracious
to
mackay
and
gave
him
land
on
which
to
build
his
home
more
important
to
mackay
than
even
his
hut
was
his
workshop
where
he
quickly
fixed
his
forge
and
anvil
vise
and
lathe
and
grindstone
for
he
was
now
in
the
place
where
he
could
practise
his
skill
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
left
home
and
friends
and
pressed
on
in
spite
of
fever
and
shipwreck
to
serve
africa
and
lead
her
to
the
worship
of
jesus
christ
by
working
and
teaching
as
our
lord
did
when
on
earth
one
day
the
wide
thatched
roof
of
that
workshop
shaded
from
the
flaming
rays
of
the
sun
a
crowded
circle
of
the
chiefs
of
uganda
with
their
slaves
who
loved
to
come
to
hear
the
bellows
roar
they
were
gazing
at
mackay
whose
strong
bare
right
arm
was
swinging
his
hammer
then
a
ruddy
glow
lit
up
the
dark
faces
of
the
watchers
and
the
bronzed
face
of
the
white
man
who
in
the
centre
of
his
workshop
was
blowing
up
his
forge
fire
gripping
in
his
pincers
the
iron
hoe
that
was
now
mackay
hammered
it
into
shape
and
then
plunged
it
all
hissing
into
the
bath
of
water
that
stood
by
him
hardly
had
the
cloud
of
steam
risen
from
the
bath
when
mackay
once
more
gripped
the
hoe
and
moving
to
his
grindstone
placed
his
foot
on
the
pedal
and
set
the
edge
of
the
hoe
against
the
whirling
stone
the
sparks
flew
high
a
murmur
came
from
the
uganda
chiefs
who
stood
around
it
is
witchcraft
they
said
to
one
another
it
is
witchcraft
by
which
makes
the
hard
iron
tenfold
harder
in
the
water
it
is
witchcraft
by
which
he
sends
the
wheels
round
and
makes
our
hoes
sharp
surely
he
is
the
great
wizard
mackay
caught
the
sound
of
the
new
name
that
they
had
given
him
the
they
called
him
by
this
name
because
to
them
it
was
very
strange
that
any
man
should
work
with
his
own
hands
women
are
for
work
said
the
chiefs
men
go
to
talk
with
the
king
and
to
fight
and
eat
mackay
paused
in
his
work
and
turned
on
them
no
he
said
you
are
wrong
god
made
man
with
one
stomach
and
with
two
hands
in
order
that
he
may
work
twice
as
much
as
he
eats
and
mackay
held
out
before
them
his
own
hands
blackened
with
the
work
of
the
smithy
rough
with
the
handling
of
hammer
and
saw
the
file
and
lathe
but
you
and
he
turned
on
them
with
a
laugh
and
pointed
to
their
sleek
bodies
as
they
shone
in
the
glow
of
the
forge
fire
you
are
all
stomach
and
no
hands
they
grinned
sheepishly
at
one
another
under
this
attack
and
as
mackay
let
down
the
fire
and
put
away
his
tools
they
strolled
off
to
the
hill
on
which
the
king
thatched
palace
was
built
mackay
climbed
up
the
hill
on
the
side
of
which
his
workshop
stood
from
the
ridge
he
gazed
over
the
marsh
from
which
the
women
were
bearing
on
their
heads
the
he
knew
that
the
men
and
women
of
the
land
were
suffering
from
fearful
illnesses
he
now
realised
that
the
fevers
came
from
the
poisonous
waters
of
the
marsh
he
made
up
his
mind
how
he
could
help
them
with
his
skill
they
must
have
pure
water
yet
they
knew
nothing
of
wells
mackay
at
once
searched
the
with
his
spade
and
found
a
bed
of
clay
emerging
from
the
side
of
the
hill
he
climbed
sixteen
feet
higher
up
the
hill
and
bringing
the
men
who
could
help
him
together
began
digging
he
knew
that
he
would
reach
spring
water
at
the
level
of
the
clay
for
the
rains
that
had
filtered
through
the
earth
would
stop
there
the
baganda
thought
that
he
was
mad
whoever
they
asked
one
another
heard
of
digging
in
the
top
of
a
hill
for
water
when
the
hole
is
so
deep
said
mackay
measuring
out
sixteen
feet
water
will
come
pure
and
clean
and
you
will
not
need
to
carry
it
up
the
hill
from
the
marsh
they
dug
and
dug
till
the
hole
was
too
deep
to
hurl
the
earth
up
over
the
edge
then
mackay
made
a
pulley
which
seemed
a
magic
thing
to
them
for
they
could
not
yet
understand
the
working
of
wheels
and
with
rope
and
bucket
the
earth
was
pulled
up
exactly
at
the
depth
of
sixteen
feet
the
water
welled
in
the
baganda
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
with
delight
mackay
is
the
great
wizard
he
is
the
mighty
spirit
they
cried
the
king
must
come
to
see
this
king
himself
wondered
at
the
story
of
the
making
of
the
well
and
the
finding
of
the
water
he
gave
orders
that
he
was
to
be
carried
to
view
this
great
wonder
his
eyes
rolled
with
astonishment
as
he
saw
it
and
heard
of
the
wonders
that
were
wrought
by
the
work
of
men
yet
and
his
men
still
wondered
why
any
man
should
work
hard
mackay
tried
to
explain
this
to
the
king
when
he
sat
in
his
work
mackay
told
is
the
noblest
thing
a
man
can
do
and
he
told
him
how
jesus
christ
the
son
of
the
great
who
made
all
things
did
not
himself
feel
that
work
was
a
thing
too
mean
for
him
for
our
lord
when
he
lived
on
earth
at
nazareth
worked
with
his
own
hands
at
the
carpenter
bench
and
made
all
labour
forever

fighting

trade
date
in
the
court
of
king
mackay
always
saw
many
boys
who
used
to
drive
away
the
flies
from
the
king
face
with
fans
carry
stools
for
the
chiefs
and
visitors
to
squat
upon
run
messages
and
make
themselves
generally
useful
most
of
these
boys
were
the
sons
of
chiefs
when
they
were
not
occupied
with
some
errand
they
would
lounge
about
playing
games
with
one
another
in
the
open
space
just
by
the
king
hut
often
when
mackay
came
to
speak
with
the
king
he
had
to
wait
in
this
place
before
he
could
have
audience
of
he
would
bring
with
him
large
sheets
of
paper
on
which
he
had
printed
in
his
workshop
the
alphabet
and
some
sentences
the
printing
was
actually
done
with
the
little
that
mackay
had
used
in
his
attic
when
he
was
a
boy
in
his
old
home
in
rhynie
he
had
taken
it
with
him
all
the
way
to
uganda
and
now
was
setting
up
letters
and
sentences
in
a
language
which
had
never
been
printed
before
the
baganda
boys
who
had
gathered
round
the
with
wondering
eyes
as
he
with
his
magic
printed
the
sheets
of
paper
now
crowded
about
him
as
he
unrolled
one
of
these
white
sheets
with
the
curious
black
smudges
on
them
mackay
made
the
noise
that
we
call
a
and
then
b
and
pointed
to
these
objects
which
we
call
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
then
he
got
them
to
make
the
noise
and
point
to
the
letter
that
represented
that
sound
at
last
the
keenest
of
the
boys
really
could
repeat
the
alphabet
right
through
and
begin
to
read
whole
words
from
another
sheet
baganda
words
so
that
at
length
they
could
read
whole
sentences
two
of
these
pioneer
boys
became
very
good
scholars
one
named
mukasa
became
a
christian
and
was
baptised
with
the
name
samweli
samuel
another
called
kakumba
was
baptised
yusufu
joseph
a
third
boy
had
been
captured
from
a
tribe
in
the
north
and
his
skin
was
of
a
much
lighter
brown
than
that
of
the
baganda
boys
this
captured
slave
was
named
lugalama
each
of
these
boys
felt
that
it
was
a
very
proud
day
when
at
last
he
could
actually
read
a
whole
sheet
of
printing
from
beginning
to
end
in
his
own

from
our
father
down
to
the

the

and
the

amen
one
morning
these
leapt
to
their
feet
as
they
heard
the
familiar
rattle
of
the
drums
that
heralded
the
coming
of
king
they
bowed
as
he
entered
the
hall
and
sat
heavily
on
his
stool
while
his
chiefs
ranged
themselves
about
him
on
a
stool
near
the
king
sat
mackay
the
his
bronzed
face
was
set
in
grim
determination
for
he
knew
that
on
that
morning
he
had
a
difficult
battle
to
fight
another
loud
battering
of
filled
the
air
the
entrance
to
the
hut
was
darkened
by
a
tall
swarthy
arab
in
long
flowing
robes
followed
by
who
cast
on
the
ground
bales
of
cloth
and
guns
the
arab
wore
on
his
head
a
red
fez
round
which
a
coloured
turban
scarf
was
wound
he
was
a
from
the
coast
who
had
come
from
the
east
to
in
uganda
to
buy
men
and
women
and
children
to
carry
them
away
into
slavery
king
was
himself
not
only
a
but
a
he
sent
his
fierce
gangs
of
warriors
out
to
raid
a
tribe
away
in
the
hills
to
the
north
they
would
dash
into
a
village
slay
the
men
and
drag
the
boys
and
girls
and
women
back
to
as
slaves
the
boy
lugalama
was
a
young
slave
who
had
been
captured
on
one
of
these
bloodthirsty
raids
and
who
often
sent
out
his
executioners
to
slay
his
own
people
by
the
hundred
to
please
the
dreaded
and
horrible
god
of
would
also
sell
his
people
by
the
hundred
to
get
guns
for
his
soldiers
the
arab
bowed
to
the
earth
before
king
who
signalled
to
him
to
speak
i
have
come
said
the
arab
pointing
to
the
guns
on
the
floor
to
bring
you
these
things
in
exchange
for
some
men
and
women
and
children
see
i
offer
you
guns
and
percussion
caps
and
cloth
and
he
spread
out
lengths
of
the
red
cloth
and
held
out
one
of
the
guns
with
its
gleaming
barrel
king
eyes
lighted
up
with
desire
as
he
saw
the
muskets
and
the
ammunition
these
he
thought
are
the
things
that
will
make
me
powerful
against
my
enemies
i
will
give
you
the
arab
went
on
one
of
these
lengths
of
red
cloth
in
exchange
for
one
man
to
be
sold
to
me
as
a
slave
one
of
these
guns
for
two
men
and
one
hundred
of
these
percussion
caps
for
a
woman
as
a
slave
mackay
looked
into
the
cruel
face
of
and
he
could
see
how
the
ambitious
king
longed
for
the
guns
should
he
risk
the
favour
of
the
king
by
fighting
the
battle
of
a
few
slaves
yet
mackay
remembered
as
he
sat
there
how
livingstone
great
fight
against
the
had
made
him
as
a
student
vow
that
he
too
would
go
out
and
fight
slavery
in
africa
the
memory
nerved
him
for
the
fight
he
was
now
to
make
mackay
turned
to
and
said
words
like
these
o
king
you
are
set
as
father
over
all
your
multitude
of
people
they
are
your
children
it
is
they
who
make
you
a
great
king
remember
o
king
that
the
sultan
of
zanzibar
himself
has
signed
a
decree
that
no
slaves
shall
be
taken
in
all
these
lands
and
sold
to
other
lands
down
beyond
the
coast
whither
this
arab
would
lead
your
children
therefore
if
you
sell
slaves
you
break
his
law
will
you
then
sell
your
own
people
that
they
may
be
taken
out
of
their
homeland
into
a
strange
country
they
will
be
chained
to
one
another
beaten
with
whips
scourged
and
kicked
and
many
will
be
left
at
the
wayside
to
die
till
the
peoples
of
the
coast
shall
laugh
at
uganda
and
say
is
how
king
lets
strangers
treat
his
children
we
can
imagine
how
the
arab
turned
and
scowled
fiercely
at
mackay
his
heart
raged
and
he
would
have
given
anything
to
plunge
the
dagger
hidden
in
his
robe
into
mackay
heart
who
was
this
white
man
who
dared
to
try
to
stop
his
trade
but
mackay
went
on
see
he
said
pointing
to
the
boys
and
the
chiefs
your
children
are
wonderfully
made
their
bones
which
are
linked
together
are
clothed
with
flesh
and
from
the
heart
in
their
breasts
the
blood
that
gives
men
life
flows
to
and
fro
through
their
bodies
while
the
breath
goes
in
and
out
of
their
lungs
and
makes
them
live
god
the
father
and
maker
of
all
men
alone
can
create
such
wonders
no
men
who
ever
lived
could
if
they
worked
all
through
their
lives
make
one
thing
so
marvellous
as
one
of
these
boys
will
you
then
sell
one
of
these
miracles
one
of
your
children
for
a
bit
of
red
rag
which
any
man
can
make
in
a
day
all
eyes
turned
to
king
to
learn
what
he
would
say
the
king
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
dismissed
the
scowling
arab
while
he
took
counsel
with
his
chiefs
and
came
to
this
decision
my
people
shall
no
more
be
made
slaves
a
decree
was
written
out
and
king
put
his
hand
to
it
the
crestfallen
arab
and
his
men
gathered
up
their
guns
and
cloths
marched
down
the
hill
to
buy
ivory
instead
of
slaves
for
their
bales
of
red
cloth
and
went
out
of
the
dominions
of
king
across
the
great
lake
homeward
mackay
had
won
the
first
battle
against
slavery
his
heart
was
very
glad
yet
he
knew
that
although
he
had
scored
a
triumph
in
this
fight
with
the
he
had
not
won
in
his
great
campaign
the
king
was
generally
kind
to
mackay
for
he
was
proud
to
have
so
clever
a
white
man
in
his
country
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
become
a
christian
heart
had
not
really
changed
his
of
other
tribes
might
still
go
on
the
horrible
butcherings
of
his
people
to
turn
away
the
dreaded
anger
of
the
gods
would
continue
mackay
felt
he
must
press
on
with
his
work
he
was
slowly
opening
a
road
through
the
jungle
of
cruelty
and
the
marshes
of
dread
of
the
gods
that
made
the
life
of
the
baganda
people
dark
and
dreadful
all
uganda
waited
breathless
one
day
as
though
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
king
is
dead
the
cry
went
out
through
all
the
land
the
people
waited
in
dread
and
on
tiptoe
of
eagerness
till
the
new
king
was
selected
by
the
chiefs
from
the
sons
of
the
dead
ruler
at
last
a
great
cheer
went
up
from
the
palace
has
eaten
uganda
they
shouted
by
this
the
people
meant
that
a
young
son
of
only
eighteen
years
old
had
been
made
king
he
was
however
a
boy
with
no
power
the
mere
feeble
tool
of
the
katikiro
the
prime
minister
and
of
mujasi
the
captain
of
the
king
own
bodyguard
of
soldiers
both
of
these
great
men
of
the
kingdom
fiercely
hated
mackay
for
they
were
jealous
of
his
power
over
the
old
king
so
they
whispered
into
the
young
ears
stories
like
this
you
know
that
men
say
that
uganda
will
be
eaten
up
by
an
enemy
from
the
lands
of
the
rising
sun
mackay
and
the
other
white
men
are
making
ready
to
bring
thousands
of
white
soldiers
into
your
land
to
it
up
and
to
kill
you
so
began
to
refuse
to
speak
to
mackay
then
because
the
king
was
afraid
to
attack
him
he
began
to
lay
plots
against
the
boys
one
morning
mackay
started
out
from
his
house
with
five
or
six
boys
and
the
crew
of
his
boat
to
march
down
to
the
lake
among
the
boys
were
young
lugalama
the
now
a
and
a
servant
to
mackay
and
kakumba
who
had
you
remember
been
baptised
joseph
the
king
and
the
katikiro
had
given
mackay
permission
to
go
down
to
the
lake
and
sail
across
it
to
take
letters
to
a
place
called
msalala
from
which
the
carriers
would
bear
them
down
to
the
coast
down
the
hill
the
party
walked
the
crew
carrying
the
baggage
and
the
oars
on
their
heads
mackay
and
his
colleague
ashe
who
had
come
out
from
england
to
work
with
him
walked
behind
to
their
surprise
there
came
running
down
the
path
behind
them
and
past
them
a
company
of
soldiers
where
are
you
going
asked
mackay
of
one
of
the
soldiers
mujasi
the
captain
of
the
bodyguard
he
replied
has
sent
us
to
capture
some
of
the
king
wives
who
have
run
away
another
and
yet
another
body
of
soldiers
rushed
past
them
mackay
became
more
and
more
suspicious
that
some
foul
plot
was
being
brewed
he
and
his
company
had
walked
ten
miles
and
the
lake
was
but
two
miles
away
divided
from
them
by
a
wood
suddenly
there
leapt
out
from
behind
the
trees
of
the
wood
hundreds
of
men
headed
by
mujasi
himself
they
levelled
their
guns
and
spears
at
mackay
and
his
friends
and
yelled
go
back
go
back
we
are
the
king
friends
replied
mackay
and
we
have
his
leave
to
travel
how
dare
you
insult
us
and
they
pushed
forward
but
the
soldiers
rushed
at
them
snatched
their
from
them
and
began
to
jostle
them
mackay
and
ashe
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
path
mujasi
came
up
to
them
where
are
you
walking
he
asked
we
are
travelling
to
the
port
with
the
permission
of
king
and
the
katikiro
you
are
a
liar
replied
mujasi
mujasi
stood
back
and
the
soldiers
rushed
at
the
missionaries
dragged
them
to
their
feet
and
held
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
within
a
few
inches
of
their
chests
mackay
turned
with
his
boys
and
marched
back
to
the
capital
he
and
ashe
were
allowed
to
go
back
to
their
own
home
on
the
side
of
the
hill
but
the
five
boys
were
marched
to
the
king
headquarters
and
imprisoned
the
katikiro
when
mackay
went
to
him
refused
to
listen
at
first
then
he
declared
that
mackay
was
always
taking
boys
out
of
the
country
and
returning
with
armies
of
white
men
and
hiding
them
with
the
intention
of
conquering
uganda
the
katikiro
waved
them
aside
and
the
angry
waiting
mob
rushed
on
the
missionaries
yelling
mine
shall
be
his
coat
mine
his
trousers
no
mine
shouted
another
as
the
men
scuffled
with
one
another
mackay
and
ashe
at
last
got
back
to
their
home
and
knelt
in
prayer
later
on
the
same
evening
they
decided
to
attempt
to
win
back
the
king
and
the
prime
minister
and
mujasi
by
gifts
so
that
their
imprisoned
boys
would
be
freed
from
danger
mackay
spoke
to
his
other
boys
telling
them
to
go
and
fly
for
their
lives
or
they
would
be
killed
in
the
morning
mackay
heard
that
three
of
the
boys
who
had
been
captured
on
the
previous
day
were
not
only
bound
as
prisoners
but
that
mujasi
was
threatening
to
burn
them
to
death
the
boys
were
named
seruwanga
kakumba
and
lugalama
the
eldest
was
fifteen
the
youngest
twelve
the
boys
were
led
out
with
a
mob
of
howling
men
and
boys
around
them
mujasi
shouted
to
them
oh
you
know
isa
masiya
jesus
christ
you
believe
you
will
rise
from
the
dead
i
shall
burn
you
and
you
will
see
if
this
is
so
a
hideous
roar
of
laughter
rose
from
the
mob
the
boys
were
led
down
the
hill
towards
the
edge
of
a
marsh
behind
them
was
a
plantation
of
banana
trees
some
men
who
had
carried
bundles
of
firewood
on
their
heads
threw
the
wood
into
a
heap
others
laid
hold
of
each
of
the
boys
and
cut
off
their
arms
with
hideous
curved
knives
so
that
they
should
not
struggle
in
the
fire
seruwanga
the
bravest
refused
to
utter
a
cry
as
he
was
cut
to
pieces
but
kakumba
shouted
to
mujasi
who
was
a
mohammedan
you
believe
in
allah
the
merciful
be
merciful
but
mujasi
had
no
mercy
we
are
told
that
the
men
who
were
watching
held
their
breath
with
awed
amazement
as
they
heard
a
boy
voice
out
of
the
flame
and
smoke
singing
daily
daily
sing
to
jesus
sing
my
soul
his
praises
due
as
the
executioners
came
towards
the
youngest
and
feeblest
lugalama
he
cried
oh
do
not
cut
off
my
arms
i
will
not
struggle
i
will
not
fight
only
throw
me
into
the
fire
but
they
did
their
ghastly
work
and
threw
the
mutilated
boy
on
a
wooden
framework
above
the
slow
fire
where
his
cries
went
up
till
at
last
there
was
silence
one
other
christian
stood
by
named
musali
mujasi
with
eyes
bloodshot
and
inflamed
with
cruelty
came
towards
him
and
cried
ah
you
are
here
i
will
burn
you
too
and
your
household
you
are
a
follower
of
isa
jesus
yes
i
am
replied
musali
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
it
was
a
marvel
of
courage
to
say
in
the
face
of
the
fire
and
knife
what
peter
dared
not
say
when
the
in
jerusalem
laughed
at
him
perhaps
the
heroism
of
musali
awed
even
the
mujasi
in
any
case
he
left
musali
alone
for
a
little
time
ceased
to
persecute
the
christians
but
the
wily
arabs
whispered
in
his
ear
that
the
white
men
were
still
trying
to
eat
up
his
country
was
filled
with
mingled
anger
and
fear
then
his
fury
burst
all
bounds
when
mujasi
said
to
him
there
is
a
great
white
man
coming
from
the
rising
sun
behind
him
will
come
thousands
of
white
soldiers
send
at
once
and
kill
him
cried
the
demented
a
boy
named
balikudembe
a
christian
heard
the
order
and
he
could
not
contain
himself
but
broke
out
oh
king
why
are
you
going
to
kill
a
white
man
your
father
did
not
do
so
but
the
soldiers
went
out
travelled
east
along
the
paths
till
they
met
the
great
bishop
hannington
being
carried
in
a
litter
stricken
with
fever
they
took
him
prisoner
and
after
some
days
slew
him
as
he
stood
defenceless
before
them
hannington
had
been
sent
out
to
help
mackay
and
his
then
the
king
fell
ill
he
believed
that
the
boy
balikudembe
who
had
warned
him
not
to
kill
the
bishop
had
bewitched
him
so
soldiers
went
and
caught
the
lad
and
led
him
down
to
a
place
where
they
lit
a
fire
and
placing
the
boy
over
it
burned
him
slowly
to
death
all
through
this
time
mackay
alone
had
not
been
really
seriously
threatened
for
his
work
and
what
he
was
made
the
king
and
the
katikiro
and
even
mujasi
afraid
to
do
him
to
death
then
there
came
a
tremendous
thunderstorm
a
flash
of
lightning
smote
the
king
house
and
it
flamed
up
and
burned
to
ashes
then
king
seemed
to
go
mad
he
threatened
to
slay
mackay
himself
take
seize
burn
the
christians
he
cried
and
his
executioners
and
their
minions
rushed
out
captured
men
and
boys
slashed
their
arms
from
their
bodies
with
their
cruel
curved
knives
so
that
they
could
not
struggle
and
then
placed
them
over
the
ghastly
flames
which
slowly
wrung
the
lives
from
their
tortured
bodies
yet
the
numbers
of
the
christians
seemed
to
grow
with
persecution
the
king
himself
beat
one
boy
apolo
kagwa
with
a
stick
and
smote
him
on
the
head
then
knocked
him
down
kicked
and
stamped
upon
him
then
the
king
burned
all
his
books
crying
never
read
again
the
other
men
and
boys
who
had
become
christians
were
now
scattered
over
the
land
in
fear
of
their
lives
mackay
however
come
what
may
determined
to
hold
on
he
set
his
little
printing
press
to
work
and
printed
off
a
letter
which
he
sent
to
the
scattered
christians
in
mackay
letter
was
written
these
words
in
days
of
old
christians
were
hated
were
hunted
were
driven
out
and
were
persecuted
for
jesus
sake
and
thus
it
is
our
beloved
brothers
do
not
deny
our
lord
jesus
at
last
mad
cruelties
grew
so
frightful
that
all
his
people
rose
in
rebellion
and
drove
him
from
the
throne
so
that
he
had
to
wander
an
outcast
by
the
mackay
at
that
time
was
working
by
the
lake
and
he
offered
to
shelter
the
deposed
king
who
had
only
a
short
time
before
threatened
his
life
two
years
passed
and
mackay
on
the
was
building
a
new
boat
in
which
he
hoped
to
sail
to
other
villages
to
teach
the
people
then
a
fever
struck
him
he
lay
lingering
for
some
days
then
he
died
aged
only
if
mackay
instead
of
becoming
a
missionary
had
entered
the
engineering
profession
he
might
have
become
a
great
engineer
when
he
was
a
missionary
in
africa
the
british
east
africa
company
offered
him
a
good
position
he
refused
it
general
gordon
offered
him
a
high
position
in
his
army
in
egypt
he
refused
it
he
held
on
when
his
friends
and
the
church
missionary
society
called
him
home
this
is
what
he
said
to
them
what
is
this
you
write
home
surely
now
in
our
terrible
dearth
of
workers
it
is
not
the
time
for
anyone
to
desert
his
post
send
us
only
our
first
twenty
men
and
i
may
be
tempted
to
come
to
help
you
to
find
the
second
twenty
he
died
when
quite
young
homeless
after
a
life
in
constant
danger
from
fever
and
from
a
tyrant
king
his
christian
disciples
having
been
burned
was
it
worth
while
the
prime
minister
of
uganda
is
apolo
kagwa
who
as
a
boy
was
kicked
and
beaten
and
stamped
upon
by
king
for
being
a
christian
and
the
king
of
uganda
daudi
son
is
a
christian
at
the
capital
there
stands
a
fine
cathedral
in
which
brown
baganda
clergy
lead
the
prayers
of
the
christian
people
on
the
place
where
the
boys
were
burned
to
death
there
stands
a
cross
put
there
by
baganda
christians
in
memory
of
the
young
martyrs
was
their
martyrdom
worth
while
all
the
slave
raiding
has
ceased
for
ever
innocent
people
are
not
slaughtered
to
appease
the
gods
the
burning
of
boys
alive
has
ceased
mackay
began
the
work
he
made
the
first
rough
road
and
as
he
made
it
he
wrote
this
will
certainly
yet
be
a
highway
for
the
king
himself
and
all
that
pass
this
way
will
come
to
know
his
name
and
a
highway
shall
be
there
and
a
way
and
it
shall
be
a
way
of
holiness
but
the
way
is
not
finished
and
the
last
words
that
mackay
wrote
were
here
is
a
sphere
for
your
energies
bring
with
you
your
highest
education
and
your
greatest
talents
and
you
will
find
scope
for
the
exercise
of
them
all
footnotes
footnote
there
is
no
record
of
the
precise
words
but
mackay
gives
the
argument
in
a
letter
home
chapter
xxi
the
black
apostle
of
the
lonely
lake
in
the
garden
in
africa
where
you
remember
david
livingstone
plighted
troth
with
mary
moffat
as
they
stood
under
an
almond
tree
there
lived
years
ago
a
boy
his
name
was
shomolekae
his
work
was
to
go
among
the
fruit
trees
when
the
peaches
and
apricots
were
growing
and
to
shout
and
make
a
noise
to
scare
away
the
birds
if
he
had
not
done
this
they
would
have
eaten
up
all
the
fruit
this
boy
was
born
in
africa
over
years
ago
when
victoria
was
a
young
queen
in
the
same
garden
was
a
gardener
also
an
african
with
a
dark
face
and
crisp
curly
hair
the
gardener
one
day
stole
some
of
the
fruit
off
the
trees
and
he
went
to
the
little
boy
shomolekae
and
offered
him
some
apricots
now
shomolekae
had
learned
to
love
the
missionary
mackenzie
who
had
come
to
live
in
the
house
at
kuruman
he
knew
that
it
was
very
wrong
of
the
gardener
to
steal
the
fruit
and
throw
the
blame
on
the
birds
so
he
said
that
he
would
not
touch
the
fruit
he
went
to
an
old
black
friend
of
his
named
paul
and
said
to
him
the
gardener
has
stolen
the
apples
and
plums
and
has
asked
me
to
eat
them
he
has
robbed
mackenzie
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
and
old
paul
went
and
told
john
mackenzie
who
took
notice
of
the
boy
shomolekae
and
learned
to
trust
him
many
months
passed
by
and
two
years
later
john
mackenzie
was
going
to
a
place
further
north
in
africa
than
kuruman
the
name
of
this
town
was
shoshong
where
mackenzie
would
live
and
teach
the
people
about
jesus
christ
so
he
went
to
the
father
of
shomolekae
whose
name
was
sebolai
sebolai
said
john
mackenzie
i
want
to
take
your
son
shomolekae
with
me
to
shoshong
sebolai
replied
i
am
willing
that
my
son
should
come
to
live
with
you
but
one
thing
i
desire
it
is
that
he
should
be
taught
his
reading
and
to
know
the
stories
in
the
bible
and
such
things
to
this
john
mackenzie
quickly
agreed
for
he
too
desired
that
the
boy
should
read
so
the
sixteen
oxen
were
yoked
to
the
big
wagon
and
amid
much
shouting
and
cracking
of
whips
and
lowing
of
oxen
and
creaking
of
john
mackenzie
shomolekae
and
the
others
started
from
kuruman
northward
to
shoshong
now
at
shoshong
the
chief
was
sekhome
who
you
remember
in
our
last
story
was
father
to
khama
so
when
they
were
at
shoshong
shomolekae
the
young
man
who
was
cook
and
khama
the
young
man
who
was
the
son
of
the
chief
worshipped
in
the
same
little
church
together
it
was
not
such
a
church
as
you
go
to
in
our
country
but
just
a
little
place
made
of
mud
bricks
that
had
been
dried
in
the
sun
there
were
holes
instead
of
windows
and
there
was
no
door
in
the
open
doorway
and
on
the
top
of
the
little
building
was
a
roof
of
rough
reedy
grass
these
were
the
days
that
you
heard
of
in
the
last
story
when
khama
seeing
his
tribe
attacked
by
the
fierce
lobengula
rode
out
on
horseback
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
of
cavalry
and
fought
them
and
beat
them
and
drove
away
lobengula
with
a
bullet
in
his
neck
for
two
years
shomolekae
learning
to
read
better
every
day
and
serving
john
mackenzie
faithfully
in
his
house
lived
at
shoshong
sometimes
shomolekae
took
long
journeys
with
wagon
and
oxen
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
went
with
mackenzie
a
great
way
in
order
to
buy
windows
doors
hinges
nails
corrugated
iron
and
timber
with
which
to
build
a
better
church
at
shoshong
when
shomolekae
came
back
again
with
the
wagons
loaded
up
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
tribe
hammers
and
saws
and
chisels
were
busy
day
after
day
and
the
missionary
and
his
helpers
laid
the
bricks
one
upon
another
until
there
rose
up
a
strong
church
with
windows
and
a
door
a
place
in
which
the
people
went
to
worship
god
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
again
shomolekae
went
away
by
wagon
and
this
time
he
travelled
away
by
the
edge
of
the
desert
southward
until
at
last
he
reached
the
garden
at
kuruman
where
as
a
boy
he
used
to
frighten
the
birds
from
the
fruit
trees
he
was
now
a
very
clever
man
at
driving
wagons
and
oxen
this
as
you
know
is
not
so
easy
as
driving
a
wagon
with
two
horses
is
in
britain
for
there
were
as
many
as
sixteen
and
even
eighteen
oxen
harnessed
two
by
two
to
the
long
iron
chains
in
front
of
the
wagon
there
were
no
roads
only
rough
tracks
and
the
wagon
would
drag
through
the
deep
sand
or
bump
over
great
boulders
of
rock
or
sink
into
wet
places
by
the
river
but
at
such
times
one
of
the
natives
always
led
the
two
front
oxen
through
the
river
with
a
long
thong
that
was
fastened
to
their
horns
so
in
order
to
drive
a
wagon
well
shomolekae
needed
to
be
able
to
manage
sixteen
oxen
all
at
once
and
keep
them
walking
in
a
straight
line
he
needed
to
know
which
were
the
ones
and
which
were
the
good
and
which
pulled
best
in
one
part
of
the
span
and
which
in
another
and
how
to
keep
them
all
pulling
together
and
not
lunging
at
one
another
with
their
horns
shomolekae
also
had
to
be
so
bold
and
daring
that
if
lions
came
to
eat
the
oxen
at
night
he
could
go
with
the
gun
and
either
frighten
them
away
or
actually
shoot
them
so
you
see
shomolekae
was
very
clever
and
was
full
of
good
courage
while
he
was
living
at
kuruman
a
man
came
to
him
one
day
and
said
john
mackenzie
is
alone
at
shoshong
and
there
is
no
one
who
can
drive
his
wagon
well
for
him
the
man
who
told
him
this
was
as
it
happened
going
by
wagon
to
shoshong
where
john
mackenzie
lived
let
me
go
with
you
said
shomolekae
so
he
got
up
into
the
wagon
and
away
they
went
day
after
day
northward
on
the
same
journey
that
shomolekae
had
taken
when
he
was
a
boy
so
shomolekae
served
mackenzie
for
years
as
wagon
driver
at
shoshong
at
last
the
time
came
when
mackenzie
himself
left
the
tribe
at
shoshong
left
khama
and
all
his
people
and
travelled
southward
to
build
at
kuruman
a
kind
of
small
school
where
he
could
train
young
black
men
to
be
missionaries
to
their
own
people
and
shomolekae
himself
went
to
kuruman
with
mackenzie
he
set
to
work
with
his
own
hands
and
he
helped
to
make
and
lay
bricks
to
put
in
the
doors
and
windows
and
to
place
the
roof
on
the
walls
until
at
last
the
little
school
was
built
and
when
it
was
actually
built
shomolekae
himself
went
to
be
a
student
there
and
mackenzie
began
to
train
him
to
be
a
preacher
and
a
teacher
to
his
own
people
for
three
years
shomolekae
worked
hard
in
the
college
learning
more
and
more
about
jesus
christ
preparing
himself
to
go
among
his
own
people
to
tell
them
about
him
at
last
the
time
came
when
he
was
ready
to
go
and
he
started
out
and
travelled
long
long
miles
through
sandy
places
and
then
by
a
river
until
at
last
he
reached
a
town
of
little
thatched
huts
called
pitsani
which
means
the
town
of
the
little
hyena
in
that
town
he
gathered
the
men
and
women
and
the
boys
and
girls
together
and
taught
them
the
things
that
he
knew
while
shomolekae
was
at
pitsani
there
came
into
that
part
of
africa
a
new
missionary
whose
name
was
wookey
it
was
decided
that
wookey
should
go
a
long
long
journey
and
settle
down
by
the
shores
of
lake
ngami
which
you
remember
david
livingstone
had
discovered
long
years
before
shomolekae
wished
to
go
out
with
wookey
into
this
country
and
to
help
so
he
took
the
wagon
and
yoked
the
oxen
to
it
loaded
it
up
with
food
and
all
the
things
needed
for
cooking
as
they
travelled
along
and
drove
the
oxen
dragging
the
wagon
over
many
hundreds
of
miles
of
country
in
which
leopards
barked
and
lions
roared
until
at
last
they
came
to
the
land
near
lake
ngami
when
they
came
into
this
land
and
found
a
place
in
which
to
settle
down
clever
shomolekae
mixed
earth
into
mud
just
as
boys
and
girls
do
in
order
to
make
but
he
made
the
mud
into
the
shape
of
bricks
and
then
placed
the
bricks
of
mud
out
into
the
sun
to
dry
the
sunshine
was
very
very
hot
indeed
so
hot
that
the
bricks
became
hard
and
dry
and
strong
day
after
day
shomolekae
worked
until
he
had
made
a
big
heap
of
bricks
with
these
he
built
a
little
house
for
wookey
to
live
in
but
these
bricks
soon
spoil
if
they
get
wet
so
he
had
to
build
a
verandah
to
keep
the
rain
from
the
walls
when
the
house
was
built
and
wookey
was
settled
in
it
they
travelled
still
further
up
the
river
to
learn
what
people
were
living
there
after
a
while
it
was
decided
that
shomolekae
should
go
and
live
in
a
small
village
by
the
river
and
there
again
begin
his
work
of
telling
the
men
and
women
of
jesus
christ
and
teaching
the
boys
and
girls
to
read
in
his
satchel
which
was
made
of
odd
bits
of
calico
print
of
different
patterns
shomolekae
had
a
with
music
the
was
written
in
the
language
of
the
people
the
sechuana
language
and
shomolekae
taught
them
from
the
book
to
sing
hymns
the
music
was
the
notation
this
is
one
of
the
hymns
yesu
oa
me
oa
nthata
leha
ke
le

mo

etc
this
is
what
these
words
mean
in
english
i
expect
you
know
them
very
well
jesus
loves
me
this
i
know
for
the
bible
tells
me
so
little
ones
to
him
belong
they
are
weak
but
he
is
strong
yes
jesus
loves
me
yes
jesus
loves
me
yes
jesus
loves
me
the
bible
tells
me
so
jesus
loves
me
he
who
died
heaven
gate
to
open
wide
he
will
wash
away
my
sin
let
his
little
child
come
in
yes
jesus
loves
me
etc
but
you
see
the
missionary
had
to
alter
the
words
sometimes
so
as
to
make
the
sechuana
lines
come
right
for
the
music
and
the
second
verse
really
means
my
jesus
loves
me
he
has
paid
my
debt
he
has
brought
me
back
from
where
i
strayed
he
has
washed
my
heart
yes
my
jesus
yes
my
jesus
yes
my
jesus
mine
in
love
they
would
learn
the
words
off
by
heart
because
there
was
only
the
one
and
they
would
sing
them
together
shomolekae
voice
leading
they
learned
them
so
well
that
sometimes
when
the
mothers
were
out
hoeing
in
the
fields
or
the
little
boys
were
paddling
in
their
canoes
and
fishing
in
the
marshy
waters
you
would
hear
them
singing
the
hymns
that
they
learned
in
shomolekae
little
school
hut
then
on
sunday
they
would
have
and
when
that
was
over
shomolekae
would
gather
the
men
and
women
and
boys
and
girls
together
all
who
would
come
and
he
would
teach
them
to
kneel
down
and
pray
to
the
one
god
who
is
our
father
and
they
would
sing
the
hymns
that
they
had
learned
and
then
he
would
speak
to
them
a
simple
little
address
telling
them
of
the
lord
jesus
but
shomolekae
desired
always
to
go
further
and
further
even
though
it
was
dangerous
and
difficult
so
he
got
a
canoe
and
launched
it
in
the
river
by
the
village
and
paddled
further
and
further
up
the
stream
under
the
overhanging
trees
and
sometimes
across
the
deep
pools
in
which
the
big
and
fierce
hippopotami
and
crocodiles
lived
he
paddled
up
the
river
okanvango
though
many
times
he
was
in
danger
of
his
life
the
river
was
not
like
rivers
in
our
own
country
deep
and
with
strong
banks
it
was
often
filled
all
over
with
reeds
and
as
shallow
as
a
swamp
and
poor
shomolekae
had
to
push
his
way
with
difficulty
through
these
reeds
always
at
night
the
poisonous
mosquitoes
came
buzzing
and
humming
around
him
the
hippopotamus
would
suddenly
come
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
with
his
wicked
beady
eyes
and
great
cavernous
mouth
with
its
enormous
teeth
yawning
at
shomolekae
as
though
he
quite
meant
to
swallow
him
whole
on
the
banks
at
night
the
lions
would
roar
and
then
the
hyenas
would
howl
but
shomolekae
brave
heart
held
on
and
he
pushed
on
up
the
river
to
preach
and
teach
the
people
in
the
villages
near
the
river
so
through
many
years
with
high
courage
and
simple
faith
shomolekae
worked
a
good
many
boys
and
girls
in
england
before
they
are
ten
years
old
own
many
more
books
than
shomolekae
ever
had
and
have
read
more
than
he
they
also
have
better
homes
than
he
for
he
pushed
on
from
one
mud
hut
to
another
along
the
rivers
and
lakes
and
all
the
possessions
that
he
had
in
the
world
could
be
put
into
the
bottom
of
his
canoe
but
our
heavenly
father
who
loves
you
and
me
went
with
him
every
step
of
the
way
when
shomolekae
taught
the
boys
and
girls
to
sing
hymns
in
praise
of
jesus
even
in
a
little
mud
hut
he
was
there
just
as
he
is
in
the
most
beautiful
church
when
we
worship
him
now
god
has
taken
shomolekae
across
the
last
river
to
be
with
himself
shomolekae
was
a
negro
with
dark
skin
and
curly
hair
we
are
white
children
with
fair
faces
and
light
hair
but
god
is
his
father
as
well
as
ours
and
loves
us
all
alike
and
wishes
to
gather
us
together
round
him
loving
him

with

those

they

and
thought
of
livingstone

and
read
in

of

on

where
the

slid
from
the

banks
into
the
water
visions
of
the
barracoons
on
the
shore
in
which
the
captured
negroes
were
penned
as
they
waited
for
the
pictures
of
villages
where
trembling
prisoners
dipped
their
hands
in
boiling
oil
to
test
their
guilt
and
wives
were
strangled
to
go
with
their
dead
chief
into
the
visions
of
the
fierce
chiefs
who
could
order
a
score
of
men
to
be
beheaded
for
a
cannibal
feast
and
then
sell
a
hundred
more
to
be
hounded
away
into

outer

of
slavery
the
calabar
where
the
missionaries
of
her
church
were
fighting
the
black
darkness
of
the
most
savage
people
of
the
world
mary
slessor
made
up
her
mind
to
go
out
and
give
her
whole
life
to
africa
so
she
offered
herself
a
timorous
girl
who
could
not
cross
a
field
with
a
cow
in
it
as
a
missionary
for
cannibal
calabar
in
west
africa
for
twelve
years
she
worked
at
the
centre
of
the
mission
in
calabar
and
then
flung
herself
into
pioneer
work
among
the
terrible
tribe
of
okoyong
no
one
had
ever
been
able
to
influence
them
they
defied
british
administration
for
fifteen
years
she
strove
there
and
won
a
power
over
the
ferocious
okoyong
savages
such
as
no
one
has
ever
wielded
i
a
wee
wee
wifie
she
said
no
very
bookit
but
i
grip
on
well
none
the
less
over
two
thousand
square
miles
of
forest
and
rivers
the
dark
savages
as
they
squat
at
night
in
the
forest
around
their
tell
one
another
stories
of
the
and
the
stories
they
tell
are
like
these
ii
the
healing
of
the
chief
the
forest
in
the
a
strange
quiet
lay
over
all
the
village
by
the
river
for
the
chief
lay
ill
in
his
hut
the
calabar
people
were
waiting
on
the
of
suspense
for
if
the
chief
died
many
of
them
would
be
slain
to
go
with
him
into
the
his
wives
and
some
of
his
soldiers
and
slaves
suddenly
a
strange
african
woman
who
had
come
over
from
another
village
entered
the
chief
harem
she
spoke
to
the
wives
of
the
chief
saying
there
lives
away
through
the
forest
at
ekenge
a
white
ma
who
can
cast
out
by
her
magic
the
demons
who
are
killing
your
chief
my
son
child
was
dying
but
the
white
ma
saved
her
and
she
is
well
many
other
wonders
has
she
done
by
the
power
of
her
juju
let
your
chief
send
for
her
and
he
will
not
die
there
was
silence
and
then
eager
chattering
for
the
women
knew
that
their
very
lives
depended
on
the
chief
getting
well
if
he
died
they
would
be
killed
they
sent
in
word
to
the
chief
about
the
strange
white
ma
let
her
be
sent
for
he
ordered
send
a
bottle
and
four
rods
value
about
a
shilling
and
messengers
to
ask
her
to
come
all
through
the
day
the
messengers
hurried
over
stream
and
hill
through
village
after
village
and
along
the
forest
paths
till
at
last
after
eight
hours
journey
they
came
to
the
village
of
ekenge
going
to
the
courtyard
of
the
chief
they
told
him
the
story
of
their
sick
chief
and
their
desire
that
the
white
ma
who
lived
in
his
village
should
come
and
heal
him
she
will
say
for
herself
what
she
will
do
said
the
chief
so
he
sent
a
messenger
to
mary
slessor
she
soon
came
over
from
her
little
house
to
learn
what
was
needed
of
her
the
story
of
the
sick
chief
was
again
told
what
is
the
matter
with
your
chief
asked
mary
slessor
blank
faces
and
nodding
heads
showed
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
i
must
go
to
him
she
declared
she
knew
that
the
way
was
full
of
perils
and
that
she
might
be
killed
by
warriors
and
wild
beasts
but
she
knew
too
that
if
she
did
not
go
and
if
the
chief
died
hundreds
of
lives
might
be
sacrificed
chief
edem
said
there
are
warriors
out
in
the
woods
and
you
will
be
killed
you
must
not
go
ma
eme
a
tall
fat
african
widow
of
ekenge
village
who
loved
mary
slessor
said
no
you
must
not
go
the
streams
are
deep
the
rains
are
come
you
could
never
get
there
but
mary
slessor
said
i
go
then
i
will
send
women
with
you
to
look
after
you
and
men
to
protect
you
said
chief
edem
mary
slessor
went
back
to
her
house
to
prepare
to
start
on
her
long
dangerous
journey
in
the
morning
she
could
not
sleep
for
wondering
whether
she
was
indeed
right
to
risk
her
life
and
all
her
work
on
the
of
saving
this
distant
sick
chief
she
knelt
down
and
asked
god
to
guide
her
then
she
felt
in
her
heart
that
she
must
go
in
the
morning
at
dawn
a
guard
of
ekenge
women
came
to
her
door
the
men
will
join
us
outside
the
village
they
said
the
skies
were
grey
the
rain
was
falling
as
they
started
when
the
village
lay
behind
them
the
rain
began
to
pour
in
sheets
it
came
down
as
only
an
african
rain
can
unceasing
torrents
of
pitiless
deluge
soon
mary
slessor
soaked
boots
became
impossible
to
walk
in
she
took
them
off
and
threw
them
into
the
bush
then
her
stockings
went
and
she
ploughed
on
in
the
mud
in
her
bare
feet
they
had
walked
for
three
hours
when
as
the
weather
began
to
clear
mary
slessor
came
out
into
a
for
neighbouring
villages
the
hundreds
of
africans
who
were
bartering
in
the
turned
and
stared
at
the
strange
white
woman
who
swiftly
passed
through
their
midst
and
disappeared
into
the
bush
beyond
so
she
pressed
on
for
hour
after
hour
her
head
throbbing
with
fever
her
dauntless
spirit
driving
her
trembling
timid
body
onward
till
at
last
when
she
had
been
walking
almost
ceaselessly
for
over
eight
hours
she
tottered
into
the
village
of
the
sick
chief
healing
mary
slessor
aching
from
head
to
foot
with
fever
and
overwhelming
weariness
did
not
lie
down
even
for
a
moment
rest
but
walked
straight
to
the
chief
who
lay
senseless
on
his
mat
on
the
mud
floor
having
examined
him
she
took
from
her
little
medicine
chest
a
drug
and
gave
a
dose
to
the
chief
but
she
could
see
at
once
that
more
of
this
medicine
was
needed
than
she
had
with
her
she
knew
that
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
some
hours
distant
another
missionary
was
working
you
must
go
across
the
river
to
ikorofiong
for
more
medicine
no
no
they
said
we
dare
not
go
they
will
slay
any
man
who
goes
there
she
was
in
despair
then
someone
said
there
is
a
man
of
that
country
living
in
his
canoe
on
the
river
perhaps
he
would
go
they
ran
down
to
the
river
and
found
him
after
much
persuading
he
at
last
went
and
returned
next
day
with
the
medicine
the
chief
whom
the
women
had
believed
to
be
almost
dead
gradually
recovered
consciousness
then
sat
up
and
took
food
at
last
he
was
quite
well
all
the
village
laughed
and
sang
for
joy
there
would
be
no
slaying
they
gathered
round
mary
slessor
in
grateful
wonder
at
her
magic
powers
she
told
them
that
she
had
come
to
them
because
she
worshipped
the
great
physician
jesus
christ
the
son
of
the
father
god
who
made
all
things
then
she
gathered
them
together
in
the
morning
and
evening
and
led
them
as
with
bowed
heads
they
all
thanked
god
for
the
healing
of
the
chief
iii
valiant
in
fight
years
passed
by
and
mary
slessor
name
was
known
in
all
the
villages
for
many
miles
she
was
to
them
the
white
ma
who
was
brave
and
wise
and
kind
she
was
mad
they
thought
because
she
was
always
rescuing
the
twin
babies
whom
the
calabar
people
throw
out
to
die
and
the
mothers
of
twins
whom
they
often
kill
but
in
some
strange
way
they
felt
that
her
wisdom
her
skill
in
healing
men
and
her
courage
which
was
more
heroic
than
that
of
their
bravest
warriors
came
from
the
spirit
who
made
all
things
she
would
wrench
guns
from
the
hands
of
drunken
savage
men
who
were
three
times
as
strong
as
she
was
at
last
she
used
to
sit
with
their
chief
as
judge
of
quarrels
and
many
times
in
palavers
between
villages
she
stopped
the
people
from
going
to
war
the
forest
one
day
a
secret
message
came
to
her
that
in
some
villages
far
away
a
man
of
one
village
had
wounded
the
chief
in
another
village
and
that
all
the
warriors
were
arming
and
holding
councils
of
war
i
must
go
and
stop
it
said
mary
slessor
you
can
not
said
her
friends
at
ekenge
the
steamer
is
coming
to
take
you
home
to
britain
because
you
are
so
you
will
miss
the
boat
you
are
too
ill
to
walk
the
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
will
kill
you
the
savage
warriors
are
out
and
will
kill
you
in
the
dark
not
knowing
who
you
are
but
i
must
go
she
answered
the
chief
insisted
that
she
must
have
two
armed
men
with
lanterns
with
her
and
that
she
must
get
the
chief
of
a
neighbouring
village
to
send
out
his
drummer
with
her
so
that
people
might
know
as
they
heard
the
drum
that
a
protected
person
was
travelling
who
must
not
be
harmed
it
was
night
and
mary
slessor
with
her
two
companions
marched
out
into
the
darkness
the
lanterns
throwing
up
strange
shadows
that
looked
like
fierce
men
in
the
darkness
through
the
night
they
walked
till
at
midnight
they
reached
the
village
where
they
were
to
ask
for
the
drum
the
chief
was
surly
you
are
going
to
a
warlike
people
he
said
they
will
not
listen
to
what
a
woman
says
you
had
better
go
back
i
will
not
protect
you
mary
slessor
was
on
her
mettle
when
you
think
of
the
woman
power
she
said
to
the
chief
you
forget
the
power
of
the
woman
god
i
shall
go
on
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
savages
in
the
villages
she
went
on
into
the
darkness
surely
she
must
be
mad
she
defied
their
chief
who
had
the
power
to
kill
her
she
had
walked
on
into
a
forest
where
ferocious
leopards
abounded
ready
to
spring
out
upon
her
and
where
men
were
drinking
themselves
into
a
fury
of
war
and
for
what
to
try
with
a
woman
tongue
to
stop
the
fiery
chiefs
and
the
savages
of
a
distant
warlike
tribe
from
fighting
surely
she
was
mad
the
she
pressed
on
through
the
darkness
then
she
saw
the
dim
outlines
of
huts
mary
slessor
had
reached
the
first
town
in
the
war
area
she
found
the
hut
where
an
old
calabar
woman
lived
who
knew
the
white
ma
who
is
there
came
a
whisper
from
within
but
even
as
she
replied
there
was
a
swift
patter
of
bare
feet
out
of
the
darkness
leapt
a
score
of
armed
warriors
they
were
all
round
her
from
all
parts
dark
shadows
sprang
forward
till
scores
of
men
with
their
chiefs
were
jostling
chattering
and
threatening
what
have
you
come
for
they
asked
i
have
heard
that
you
are
going
to
war
i
have
come
to
ask
you
not
to
fight
she
replied
the
chiefs
hurriedly
talked
together
then
they
came
to
her
and
said
the
white
ma
is
welcome
she
shall
hear
all
that
we
have
to
say
before
we
fight
all
the
same
we
shall
fight
for
here
you
see
are
men
wounded
we
wipe
out
the
disgrace
that
is
put
upon
us
now
she
must
rest
women
you
take
care
of
the
white
ma
we
will
call
her
at
when
we
start
this
meant
an
hour
sleep
mary
slessor
lay
down
in
a
hut
it
seemed
as
though
her
eyes
were
hardly
shut
before
she
was
wakened
again
she
stood
tottering
with
tiredness
when
she
heard
the
cry
run
ma
run
the
warriors
were
off
down
the
hill
away
to
the
fight
she
ran
but
they
were
quickly
out
of
sight
on
the
way
to
the
attack
was
all
her
trouble
in
vain
she
pressed
on
weak
and
breathless
but
determined
she
heard
wild
yells
and
the
roll
of
the
war
drum
the
warriors
she
had
followed
were
feverishly
making
ready
to
fight
a
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
enemy
village
she
went
up
to
them
and
spoke
sternly
behave
like
men
she
said
not
like
fools
do
not
yell
and
shout
hold
your
peace
i
am
going
into
the
village
there
she
pointed
to
the
enemy
then
she
walked
forward
ahead
of
her
stood
the
enemy
in
unbroken
ranks
of
dark
warriors
they
stood
like
a
solid
wall
she
hailed
them
as
she
walked
forward
there
was
an
ominous
silence
she
laughed
how
perfect
your
manners
are
she
exclaimed
she
was
about
to
walk
forward
and
force
them
to
make
way
for
her
when
an
old
chief
stepped
out
toward
her
and
to
her
amazement
knelt
down
at
her
feet
ma
he
said
we
thank
you
for
coming
to
us
we
own
that
we
wounded
the
chief
over
there
it
was
only
one
of
our
men
who
did
it
it
was
not
the
act
of
all
our
town
we
ask
you
that
you
will
speak
with
our
enemy
to
bring
them
to
peace
with
us
healed
she
looked
into
the
face
of
the
chief
then
she
saw
to
her
joy
that
this
was
the
very
chief
whom
she
had
toiled
through
the
rain
to
heal
long
ago
because
of
what
she
had
done
then
he
was
now
at
her
feet
asking
her
to
make
peace
should
she
run
back
and
tell
the
warriors
who
a
hundred
yards
away
were
spoiling
for
a
fight
that
was
her
first
joyful
thought
then
she
saw
that
she
must
first
make
her
authority
stronger
over
the
whole
band
of
warriors
stay
where
you
are
she
said
some
of
you
find
a
place
where
i
can
sit
in
comfort
and
bring
me
food
i
will
not
starve
while
men
fight
choose
two
or
three
men
to
speak
well
for
you
and
we
will
have
two
men
from
your
enemies
these
grim
warriors
so
sullen
and
threatening
a
few
moments
ago
obeyed
her
every
word
at
length
two
chiefs
came
from
the
other
side
and
stood
on
one
side
of
her
while
the
two
chiefs
chosen
in
the
village
came
and
threw
down
their
arms
and
knelt
at
their
feet
your
chief
they
said
was
wounded
by
a
drunken
youth
do
not
let
us
shed
blood
through
all
our
villages
because
of
what
he
did
if
you
will
cease
from
war
with
us
we
will
pay
to
you
any
fine
that
the
white
ma
shall
say
she
too
pressed
them
to
stop
their
fighting
word
went
back
to
the
warriors
on
both
sides
who
became
wildly
excited
some
agreed
others
stormed
and
raged
till
they
were
in
a
frenzy
would
they
fight
even
over
her
body
furious
warriors
came
moving
up
from
both
sides
but
by
arguing
and
appealing
at
last
she
persuaded
the
warlike
tribe
to
accept
a
fine
promise
of
the
town
whose
drunken
youth
had
wounded
the
enemy
chief
at
once
paid
a
part
of
the
fine
they
used
no
money
so
the
fine
was
paid
in
casks
and
bottles
of
trade
gin
mary
slessor
trembled
for
as
the
boxes
of
gin
bottles
were
brought
forward
the
warriors
pranced
with
excitement
and
made
ready
to
get
drunk
she
knew
that
this
would
make
them
fight
after
all
what
could
she
do
the
roar
of
voices
rose
she
could
not
make
her
own
voice
heard
a
daring
idea
flashed
into
her
mind
according
to
the
law
of
these
egbo
people
clothes
thrown
over
anything
give
it
the
protection
of
your
body
she
snatched
off
her
skirt
and
all
the
clothing
she
could
spare
and
spread
them
over
the

jesus
christ

name
she
had
come

she
said
go
to
your
rest
and
fight
no
more
and
the
tribes
kept
their
promise
to
her

that
when

and
time
of
incidents
about
arab
one
day
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
two
young
arabs
abdallah
and
sabat
rode
on
their
camels
toward
a
city
that
was
hidden
among
the
tawny
hills
standing
upon
the
skyline
the
sun
was
beginning
to
drop
toward
the
edge
of
the
desert
away
in
the
direction
of
the
red
sea
the
shadows
of
the
long
swinging
legs
of
the
camels
wavered
in
grotesque
lines
on
the
sand
there
was
a
look
of
excited
expectation
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
arabs
for
by
sunset
their
feet
would
walk
the
city
of
their
dreams
they
were
bound
for
mecca
the
birthplace
of
mohammed
the
holy
city
toward
which
every
man
of
the
mohammedan
world
turns
five
times
a
day
as
he
cries
there
is
no
god
but
allah
and
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
allah
to
have
worshipped
in
mecca
before
the
sacred
kaaba
and
to
have
kissed
the
black
stone
in
its
wall
this
was
to
make
paradise
certain
for
them
both
having
done
that
pilgrimage
these
two
arabs
sabat
and
abdallah
would
be
able
to
take
the
proud
title
of
haji
which
would
proclaim
to
every
man
that
they
had
been
to
mecca
the
holy
of
holies
so
they
pressed
on
by
the
valley
between
the
hills
till
they
saw
before
them
the
roofs
and
the
minarets
of
mecca
itself
as
darkness
rushed
across
the
desert
and
the
stars
came
out
the
tired
camels
knelt
in
the
courtyard
of
the
khan
and
sabat
and
abdallah
alighted
and
stretched
their
cramped
legs
and
took
their
sleep
these
young
men
sabat
and
abdallah
the
sons
of
notable
arab
chiefs
had
struck
up
a
great
friendship
now
each
in
company
with
his
chum
they
were
together
at
the
end
of
the
greatest
journey
that
an
arab
can
take
as
the
first
faint
flush
of
pink
touched
the
mountain
beyond
mecca
the
cry
came
from
the
minaret
come
to
prayer
prayer
is
better
than
sleep
there
is
no
god
but
allah
sabat
and
abdallah
were
already
up
and
out
and
that
day
they
said
the
mohammedan
prayer
before
the
kaaba
itself
with
other
pilgrims
who
had
come
from
many
lands
from
egypt
and
abyssinia
from
constantinople
and
damascus
baghdad
and
bokhara
from
the
defiles
of
the
khyber
pass
from
the
streets
of
delhi
and
the
harbour
of
zanzibar
we
do
not
know
what
abdallah
looked
like
he
was
probably
like
most
young
arab
chieftains
a
tall
sinewy
man
with
hair
and
a
beard
that
were
between
brown
and
black
his
friend
sabat
was
however
so
striking
that
even
in
that
great
crowd
of
many
pilgrims
people
would
turn
to
look
at
him
they
would
turn
round
for
one
reason
because
of
sabat
voice
even
when
he
was
just
talking
to
his
friend
his
voice
sounded
like
a
roar
when
he
got
excited
and
in
a
passion
as
he
very
often
did
it
rolled
like
thunder
and
was
louder
than
most
men
shouting
as
he
spoke
his
large
white
teeth
gleamed
in
his
wide
mouth
his
brown
face
and
black
arched
eyebrows
were
a
dark
setting
for
round
eyes
that
flashed
as
he
spoke
his
black
beard
flowed
over
his
tawny
throat
and
neck
gold
earrings
swung
with
his
agitation
and
a
gold
chain
gleamed
round
his
neck
he
wore
a
bright
silk
jacket
with
long
sleeves
and
long
trousers
and
richly
embroidered
shoes
with
toes
from
a
girdle
round
his
waist
hung
a
dagger
whose
handle
and
hilt
flashed
with
jewels
abdallah
and
sabat
were
better
educated
than
most
arabs
for
they
could
both
read
but
they
were
not
men
who
could
stay
in
one
place
and
read
and
think
in
quiet
when
they
had
finished
their
worship
at
mecca
they
determined
to
ride
far
away
across
the
deserts
eastward
even
to
kabul
in
the
mountains
of
afghanistan
so
they
rode
first
northward
up
the
great
toward
damascus
and
then
eastward
in
spite
of
robbers
and
hungry
jackals
through
mountain
gorges
over
streams
across
the
syrian
desert
from
oasis
to
oasis
and
then
across
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
they
went
till
they
had
climbed
rung
by
rung
the
mountain
ranges
that
hold
up
the
great
plateau
of
persia
at
last
they
broke
in
upon
the
rocky
valleys
of
afghanistan
and
came
to
the
gateway
of
india
to
kabul
they
presented
themselves
to
zeman
shah
the
ruler
of
afghanistan
and
he
was
so
taken
with
capacity
that
he
asked
him
to
be
one
of
his
officers
in
the
court
so
abdallah
stayed
in
kabul
but
the
restless
fiery
sabat
turned
the
face
of
his
camel
westward
and
rode
back
into
persia
to
the
lovely
city
of
bokhara
the
in
kabul
there
was
an
armenian
whose
name
we
do
not
know
but
he
owned
a
book
printed
in
arabic
a
book
that
abdallah
could
read
the
armenian
lent
it
to
him
there
were
hardly
any
books
in
arabic
so
abdallah
took
this
book
and
read
it
eagerly
as
he
read
he
thought
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
heard
of
such
wonderful
things
and
he
could
feel
in
his
very
bones
that
they
were
true
he
read
four
short
true
stories
in
this
book
they
were
what
we
call
the
gospels
according
to
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
as
he
read
abdallah
saw
in
the
stories
someone
who
was
infinitely
greater
than
mohammed
one
who
was
so
strong
and
gentle
that
he
was
always
helping
children
and
women
and
people
who
were
ill
so
good
that
he
always
lived
the
very
life
that
god
willed
and
so
brave
that
he
died
rather
than
give
in
to
evil
men
our
lord
jesus
christ
i
worship
him
said
abdallah
in
his
heart
then
he
did
a
very
daring
thing
he
knew
that
if
he
turned
christian
it
would
be
the
duty
of
mohammedans
to
kill
him
why
not
keep
quiet
and
say
nothing
about
his
change
of
heart
but
he
could
not
he
decided
that
he
must
come
out
in
the
open
and
confess
the
new
captain
of
his
life
he
was
baptized
a
christian
the
moslems
were
furious
to
save
his
life
abdallah
fled
on
his
camel
westward
to
bokhara
but
the
news
that
he
had
become
a
christian
flew
even
faster
than
he
himself
rode
as
he
went
along
the
streets
of
bokhara
he
saw
his
friend
sabat
coming
toward
him
as
a
friend
sabat
desired
to
save
abdallah
but
as
a
moslem
the
cruel
law
of
mohammed
said
that
he
must
have
him
put
to
death
and
sabat
was
a
fiery
moslem
i
had
no
pity
sabat
told
his
friends
afterward
i
delivered
him
up
to
morad
shah
the
king
so
abdallah
was
bound
and
carried
before
the
moslem
judges
his
friend
sabat
stood
by
watching
just
as
saul
had
stood
watching
them
stone
stephen
nearly
eighteen
centuries
earlier
you
shall
be
given
your
life
and
be
set
free
they
said
if
you
will
spit
upon
the
cross
and
renounce
christ
and
say
is
no
god
but
allah
i
refuse
said
abdallah
a
sword
was
brought
forward
and
unsheathed
abdallah
arm
was
stretched
out
the
sword
was
lifted
it
flashed
and
abdallah
hand
cut
clean
off
fell
on
the
ground
while
the
blood
spurted
from
his
arm
your
life
will
still
be
given
you
if
you
renounce
christ
and
proclaim
allah
and
mohammed
as
his
prophet
this
is
how
sabat
himself
described
what
happened
next
abdallah
made
no
answer
but
looked
up
steadfastly
toward
heaven
like
stephen
the
first
martyr
his
eyes
streaming
with
tears
he
looked
at
me
said
sabat
but
it
was
with
the
countenance
of
forgiveness
abdallah
other
arm
was
stretched
out
again
the
sword
flashed
and
fell
his
other
hand
dropped
to
the
ground
he
stood
there
bleeding
and
handless
he
bowed
his
head
and
his
neck
was
bared
to
the
sword
again
the
blade
flashed
he
was
beheaded
and
sabat
sabat
who
had
ridden
a
thousand
miles
with
his
friend
and
had
faced
with
him
the
blistering
sun
of
the
desert
and
the
of
the
mountain
saw
abdallah
head
lie
there
on
the
ground
and
the
dead
body
carried
away
abdallah
had
died
because
he
was
faithful
to
jesus
christ
and
because
sabat
had
obeyed
the
law
of
mohammed
old
sabat
and
the
the
news
spread
through
bokhara
like
a
forest
fire
they
could
hardly
believe
that
a
man
would
die
for
the
christian
faith
like
that
as
sabat
told
his
friends
afterward
all
bokhara
seemed
to
say
new
thing
is
this
but
sabat
was
in
agony
of
mind
nothing
that
he
could
do
would
take
away
from
his
eyes
the
vision
of
his
friend
face
as
abdallah
had
looked
at
him
when
his
hands
were
being
cut
off
he
plunged
out
on
to
the
camel
tracks
of
asia
to
try
to
forget
he
wandered
far
and
he
wandered
long
but
he
could
not
forget
or
find
rest
for
his
tortured
mind
at
last
he
sailed
away
on
the
seas
and
landed
on
the
coast
of
india
at
madras
the
british
east
india
company
then
ruled
in
india
and
they
gave
sabat
a
post
in
the
civil
courts
as
mufti
as
an
expounder
of
the
law
of
mohammed
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
a
coast
town
north
of
madras
called
vizagapatam
a
friend
handed
to
him
there
a
little
book
in
his
native
language
arabic
it
was
another
translation
of
those
stories
that
abdallah
had
read
in
kabul
it
was
the
new
testament
sabat
sat
reading
this
new
book
he
then
took
up
the
book
of
mohammed
law
the
koran
which
it
was
his
daily
work
to
explain
he
compared
the
two
the
truth
came
as
he
himself
said
like
a
flood
of
light
he
too
began
to
worship
jesus
christ
whose
life
he
had
read
now
for
the
first
time
in
the
new
testament
sabat
decided
that
he
must
follow
in
abdallah
footsteps
he
became
a
christian
he
was
then
years
of
age
brother
in
the
world
of
the
east
news
travels
like
magic
by
arab
dhow
sailing
ship
and
camel
caravan
very
quickly
the
news
was
in
arabia
that
sabat
had
renounced
mohammed
and
become
a
christian
at
once
brother
rose
girded
on
his
dagger
left
the
tents
of
his
tribe
mounted
his
camel
and
coursed
across
arabia
to
a
port
there
he
took
ship
for
madras
landing
he
disguised
himself
as
an
indian
and
went
up
to
vizagapatam
to
the
house
where
his
brother
sabat
was
living
sabat
saw
this
indian
as
he
appeared
to
be
standing
before
him
he
suspected
nothing
suddenly
the
disguised
brother
put
his
hand
within
his
robe
seized
his
dagger
and
leaping
at
sabat
made
a
fierce
blow
at
him
sabat
flung
out
his
arm
he
spoilt
his
brother
aim
but
he
was
too
late
to
save
himself
he
was
wounded
but
not
killed
the
brother
threw
off
his
disguise
and
sabat
remembering
the
forgiveness
of
abdallah
forgave
his
brother
gave
him
many
presents
and
sent
loving
messages
to
his
mother
sabat
decided
that
he
could
no
longer
work
as
an
expounder
of
moslem
law
he
wanted
to
do
work
that
would
help
to
spread
the
christian
faith
he
went
away
north
to
calcutta
and
there
he
joined
the
great
men
who
were
working
at
the
task
of
translating
the
bible
into
different
languages
and
printing
them
this
work
pleased
sabat
for
was
it
not
through
reading
an
arabic
new
testament
that
all
his
own
life
had
been
changed
because
sabat
knew
persian
as
well
as
arabic
he
was
sent
to
help
a
very
clever
young
chaplain
from
england
named
henry
martyn
who
was
busily
at
work
translating
the
new
testament
into
persian
and
arabic
so
sabat
went
up
the
ganges
to
cawnpore
with
henry
martyn
sabat
fiery
temper
nearly
drove
martyn
wild
his
was
a
flaming
arab
spirit
and
impetuous
yet
he
would
be
ready
to
die
for
the
man
he
cared
for
proud
and
often
ignorant
yet
simple
as
martyn
said
an
artless
child
of
the
desert
sabat
knowledge
of
persian
was
not
really
so
good
as
he
himself
thought
it
was
and
some
of
the
indian
translators
at
calcutta
criticised
his
translation
at
this
he
got
furiously
angry
and
like
peter
the
fiery
impetuous
apostle
he
denied
jesus
christ
and
spoke
against
christianity
with
his
heart
burning
with
rage
and
his
great
voice
thundering
with
anger
sabat
left
his
friends
went
aboard
ship
and
sailed
down
the
bay
of
bengal
by
the
coast
till
he
came
to
penang
where
he
began
to
live
as
a
trader
but
by
this
time
the
fire
of
his
anger
had
burnt
itself
out
he
again
like
peter
remembered
his
denial
of
his
master
and
when
he
saw
in
a
penang
newspaper
an
article
saying
that
the
famous
sabat
who
had
become
a
christian
and
then
become
a
mohammedan
again
had
come
to
live
in
their
city
he
wrote
a
letter
which
was
published
in
the
newspaper
at
penang
declaring
that
he
was
now
and
for
good
and
all
a
christian
a
british
officer
named
colonel
macinnes
was
stationed
at
penang
sabat
went
to
him
my
mind
is
full
of
great
sorrow
he
said
because
i
denied
jesus
christ
i
have
not
had
a
moment
peace
since
satan
made
me
do
that
bad
work
i
did
it
for
revenge
i
only
want
to
do
one
thing
with
my
life
to
spend
it
in
undoing
this
evil
that
has
come
through
my
denial
sabat
left
the
house
of
the
mohammedan
with
whom
he
was
living
in
penang
he
found
an
old
friend
of
his
named
johannes
an
armenian
christian
merchant
who
had
lived
in
madras
in
the
very
days
when
sabat
first
became
a
christian
every
night
johannes
the
armenian
and
sabat
the
arab
got
out
their
bibles
and
far
into
the
night
sabat
would
explain
their
meaning
to
johannes
prince
from
one
day
all
penang
was
agog
with
excitement
because
a
brown
prince
from
acheen
a
malay
state
in
the
island
of
sumatra
had
suddenly
sailed
into
the
harbour
he
was
in
flight
from
his
own
land
where
rebels
had
attacked
him
the
people
of
acheen
were
wild
and
ferocious
many
of
them
were
cannibals
i

said
sabat
to
the
fugitive
prince
i
am
going
said
sabat
to
colonel
macinnes
to
see
if
i
can
carry
the
message
of
christianity
to
this
fierce
people
so
sabat
and
the
prince
with
others
went
aboard
a
sailing
ship
and
crossed
the
strait
of
malacca
to
sumatra
they
landed
and
for
long
the
struggle
with
the
rebels
swayed
from
side
to
side
the
prince
was
so
pleased
with
sabat
that
he
made
him
his
prime
minister
but
the
struggle
dragged
on
and
on
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
of
triumph
at
last
sabat
decided
to
go
back
to
penang
one
day
he
left
the
prince
and
started
off
but
soldiers
of
the
syfoolalim
captured
him
great
was
the
joy
of
the
rebels
their
powerful
enemy
was
in
their
hands
they
bound
him
threw
him
into
a
boat
hoisted
him
aboard
a
sailing
ship
and
clapped
him
in
the
stifling
darkness
of
the
hold
as
he
lay
there
he
pierced
his
arm
to
make
it
bleed
and
with
the
blood
that
came
out
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
was
smuggled
out
and
sent
to
penang
to
colonel
macinnes
the
agonies
that
sabat
suffered
in
the
gloom
and
filth
of
that
hold
no
one
will
ever
know
we
can
learn
from
the
words
that
he
wrote
in
the
blood
from
his
own
body
that
they
loaded
worse
horrors
upon
him
because
he
was
a
christian
all
the
scene
is
black
but
out
of
the
darkness
comes
a
voice
that
makes
us
feel
that
sabat
was
faithful
at
the
end
in
his
last
letter
to
colonel
macinnes
he
told
how
he
was
now
ready
like
his
friend
abdallah
to
die
for
the
sake
of
that
master
whom
he
had
in
his
rage
denied
then
one
day
his
cruel
gaolers
came
to
the
hold
where
he
lay
and
binding
his
limbs
thrust
him
into
a
sack
which
they
then
closed
in
the
choking
darkness
of
the
sack
he
was
carried
on
deck
and
dragged
to
the
side
of
the
ship
he
heard
the
lapping
of
the
waves
he
felt
himself
lifted
and
then
hurled
out
into
the
air
and
down
down
with
a
crash
into
the
waters
of
the
sea
which
closed
over
him

ever

for

that

he
worked
with
an
englishman
named
henry
martyn
sabat
was
almost
a
giant
henry
martyn
was
slight
and
not
very
strong
yet
as
we
shall
see
in
the
story
that
follows
henry
martyn
was
braver
and
more
constant
than
sabat
himself
as
a
boy
henry
who
was
born
and
went
to
school
in
truro
in
cornwall
in
the
west
of
england
was
violently
passionate
sensitive
and
physically
rather
fragile
and
at
school
was
protected
from
bullies
by
a
big
boy
the
son
of
admiral
kempthorne
he
left
school
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
shot
and
read
till
he
was
seventeen
in
he
became
an
undergraduate
at
john
college
cambridge
he
was
still
very
passionate
for
instance
when
a
man
was
ragging
him
in
the
college
hall
at
dinner
he
was
so
furious
that
he
flung
a
knife
at
him
which
stuck
quivering
in
the
panelling
of
the
wall
kempthorne
his
old
friend
was
at
cambridge
with
him
they
used
to
read
the
bible
together
and
martyn
became
a
real
christian
and
fought
hard
to
overcome
his
violent
temper
he
was
a
very
clever
scholar
and
became
a
fellow
of
jesus
college
in
he
at
that
time
took
orders
in
the
church
of
england
he
became
very
keen
on
reading
about
missionary
work

story
of
nine
years
work
in
and
the
report
on
vanderkemp
in

i
read
nothing

while
it
lasted
he
said
of
the
vanderkemp
report
he
was
accepted
as
a
chaplain
of
the
east
india
company
they
could
not
sail
till
admiral
nelson
gave
the
word
because
the
french
were
waiting
to
capture
all
the
british
ships
five
convoyed
them
when
they
sailed
in
they
waited
off

because
the
immediate

by

was
threatened
on

martyn
worked
hard
at
hindustani
bengali
and
portuguese
he
already
knew
greek
latin
and
hebrew
he
arrived
at
madras
south
india
and
calcutta
and
thence
went
to
cawnpore
it
is
at
this
point
that
our
yarn
begins
a
voice
like
thunder
speaking
in
a
strange
tongue
shouted
across
an
indian
garden
one
night
in
the
new
moon
looking
like
a
ball
of
ebony
in
an
ivory
cup
as
one
who
was
there
that
night
said
threw
a
cold
light
over
the
palm
trees
and
aloes
on
the
man
who
was
speaking
and
on
those
who
were
seated
around
him
at
the
table
in
the
bungalow
beyond
the
garden
the
life
of
cawnpore
moved
in
its
many
streets
the
shout
of
a
the
shrill
of
a
bugle
from
the
barracks
broke
sharply
through
the
muffled
sounds
of
the
city
the
june
wind
heavy
with
the
waters
of
the
ganges
which
flows
past
cawnpore
made
the
night
insufferably
hot
but
the
heat
did
not
trouble
sabat
the
wild
son
of
the
arabian
desert
who
was
talking
as
he
always
did
in
a
roaring
voice
that
was
louder
than
most
men
shouting
he
was
telling
the
story
of
abdallah
brave
death
as
a
christian
martyr
quietly
listening
to
sabat
voice
though
he
could
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
was
a
young
italian
padre
julius
cæsar
a
monk
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
on
his
head
was
a
little
over
his
body
a
robe
of
fine
purple
satin
held
with
a
girdle
of
twisted
silk
near
him
sat
an
indian
scholar
on
his
dark
head
a
full
turban
and
about
him
robes
on
the
other
side
sat
a
little
thin
bengali
dressed
in
white
and
a
british
officer
in
his
scarlet
and
gold
uniform
with
his
wife
who
has
told
us
the
story
of
that
evening
not
one
of
these
brightly
dressed
people
was
however
the
strongest
power
there
a
man
in
black
clothes
was
the
real
centre
of
the
group
very
slight
in
build
not
tall
with
a
high
forehead
and
sensitive
lips
young
henry
martyn
seemed
a
stripling
beside
the
flaming
arab
yet
sabat
with
all
his
sound
and
fury
was
no
match
for
the
young
englishman
henry
martyn
was
a
chaplain
in
the
army
of
the
east
india
company
which
then
ruled
in
india
he
was
the
only
one
of
those
who
were
listening
to
sabat
who
could
understand
what
he
was
saying
when
sabat
had
finished
his
story
martyn
turned
and
in
his
clear
musical
voice
translated
it
from
the
persian
into
latin
mixed
with
italian
for
padre
julius
cæsar
into
hindustani
for
the
indian
scholar
into
bengali
for
the
bengal
gentleman
and
into
english
for
the
british
officer
and
his
wife
martyn
could
also
talk
to
sabat
himself
both
in
arabic
and
in
persian
as
martyn
listened
to
the
rolling
sentences
of
sabat
the
christian
arab
he
seemed
to
see
the
lands
beyond
india
away
across
the
khyber
pass
where
sabat
had
travelled
mesopotamia
arabia
persia
henry
martyn
knew
that
in
all
those
lands
the
people
were
mohammedans
he
wanted
one
thing
above
everything
else
in
the
world
that
was
to
give
them
all
the
chance
of
doing
what
sabat
and
abdallah
had
done
the
chance
of
reading
in
their
own
languages
the
one
book
in
the
world
that
could
tell
them
that
god
was
a
father
the
book
of
letters
and
of
biographies
that
we
call
the
new
testament
toil
of
there
was
not
in
the
world
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
in
good
persian
to
make
one
henry
martyn
slaved
hard
far
into
the
hot
sultry
indian
nights
with
scores
of
mosquitoes
pinging
round
his
lamp
and
his
head
grinding
at
his
persian
grammar
so
that
he
could
translate
the
life
of
jesus
christ
into
that
language
even
while
he
was
listening
to
sabat
story
in
the
bungalow
at
cawnpore
martyn
knew
that
he
was
so
ill
that
he
could
not
live
for
many
years
more
the
doctor
said
that
he
must
leave
india
for
a
time
to
be
in
a
healthier
place
should
he
go
home
to
england
where
all
his
friends
were
he
wanted
that
but
much
more
he
wanted
to
go
on
with
his
work
so
he
asked
the
doctor
if
he
might
go
to
persia
on
the
way
home
and
he
agreed
so
martyn
went
down
from
cawnpore
to
calcutta
and
in
a
boat
down
the
hoogli
river
to
the
little
arab
coasting
sailing
ship
the
which
hoisted
sail
and
started
on
its
voyage
round
india
to
bombay
martyn
read
while
on
board
the
old
testament
in
the
original
hebrew
and
the
new
testament
in
the
original
greek
so
that
he
might
understand
them
better
and
make
a
more
perfect
translation
into
persian
he
read
the
koran
of
mohammed
so
that
he
could
argue
with
the
persians
about
it
and
he
worked
hard
at
arabic
grammar
and
read
books
in
persian
yet
he
was
for
ever
cracking
jokes
with
his
fellow
travellers
cooped
up
in
the
little
ship
on
the
hot
tropical
seas
from
bombay
the
governor
granted
martyn
a
passage
up
the
persian
gulf
in
the
a
ship
in
the
indian
navy
that
was
going
on
a
cruise
to
finish
the
exciting
work
of
hunting
down
the
fierce
arab
pirates
of
the
persian
gulf
so
on
lady
day
the
sailors
got
her
under
weigh
and
tacked
northward
up
the
gulf
till
at
last
on
may
the
roofs
and
minarets
of
bushire
hove
in
sight
martyn
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
could
see
the
town
jutting
out
into
the
gulf
on
a
spit
of
sand
and
the
sea
almost
surrounding
it
that
day
he
set
foot
for
the
first
time
on
the
soil
of
persia
persia
on
a
aboard
ship
martyn
had
allowed
his
beard
and
moustache
to
grow
when
he
landed
at
bushire
he
bought
and
wore
the
clothes
of
a
persian
gentleman
so
that
he
should
escape
from
attracting
everybody
notice
by
wearing
clothes
such
as
the
people
had
never
seen
before
no
one
who
had
seen
the
pale
clergyman
in
black
silk
coat
and
trousers
in
cawnpore
would
have
recognised
the
henry
martyn
who
rode
out
that
night
on
his
pony
with
an
armenian
servant
zechariah
of
isfahan
on
his
long
one
hundred
and
seventy
mile
journey
from
bushire
to
shiraz
he
wore
a
conical
cap
of
black
astrakhan
fur
great
baggy
trousers
of
blue
bright
red
leather
boots
a
light
tunic
of
chintz
and
over
that
a
flowing
cloak
they
went
out
through
the
gates
of
bushire
on
to
the
great
plain
of
burning
sand
that
stretched
away
for
ninety
miles
ahead
of
them
they
travelled
by
night
because
the
day
was
intolerably
hot
but
even
at
midnight
the
heat
was
over
degrees
it
was
a
fine
moonlight
night
the
stars
sparkled
over
the
plain
the
bells
tinkled
on
the
necks
as
they
walked
across
the
sand
all
else
was
silent
at
last
dawn
broke
martyn
pitched
his
little
tent
under
a
tree
the
only
shelter
he
could
get
gradually
the
heat
grew
more
and
more
intense
he
was
already
so
ill
that
it
was
difficult
to
travel
when
the
thermometer
was
above
degrees
fever
heat
says
martyn
i
began
to
lose
my
strength
fast
it
became
intolerable
i
wrapped
myself
up
in
a
blanket
and
all
the
covering
i
could
get
to
defend
myself
from
the
air
by
this
means
the
moisture
was
kept
a
little
longer
upon
the
body
i
thought
i
should
have
lost
my
senses
the
thermometer
at
last
stood
at
degrees
i
concluded
that
death
was
inevitable
at
last
the
sun
went
down
the
thermometer
crept
lower
it
was
night
and
time
to
start
again
but
martyn
had
not
slept
or
eaten
he
could
hardly
sit
upright
on
his
pony
yet
he
set
out
and
travelled
on
through
the
night
next
morning
he
had
a
little
shelter
of
leaves
and
branches
made
and
an
arab
poured
water
on
the
leaves
and
on
martyn
all
day
to
try
to
keep
some
of
the
frightful
heat
from
him
but
even
then
the
heat
almost
slew
him
so
they
marched
on
through
another
night
and
then
camped
under
a
grove
of
date
palms
i
threw
myself
on
the
burning
ground
and
slept
martyn
wrote
when
the
tent
came
up
i
awoke
in
a
burning
fever
all
day
i
had
recourse
to
the
wet
towel
which
kept
me
alive
but
would
allow
of
no
sleep
at
nine
that
night
they
struck
camp
the
ground
threw
up
the
heat
that
it
had
taken
from
the
sun
during
the
day
so
frightfully
hot
was
the
air
that
even
at
midnight
martyn
could
not
travel
without
a
wet
towel
round
his
face
and
neck
as
the
night
drew
on
the
plain
grew
rougher
then
it
began
to
rise
to
the
foothills
and
mountains
at
last
the
pony
and
mules
were
clambering
up
rough
steep
paths
so
wild
that
there
was
as
martyn
said
nothing
to
mark
the
road
but
the
rocks
being
a
little
more
worn
in
one
place
than
in
another
suddenly
in
the
darkness
the
pony
stopped
dimly
through
the
gloom
martyn
could
see
that
they
were
on
the
edge
of
a
tremendous
precipice
a
single
step
more
would
have
plunged
him
over
to
be
smashed
on
the
rocks
hundreds
of
feet
below
martyn
did
not
move
or
try
to
guide
the
beast
he
knew
that
the
pony
himself
was
the
safest
guide
in
a
minute
or
two
the
animal
moved
and
step
by
step
clambered
carefully
up
the
at
last
they
came
out
on
the
mountain
top
but
only
to
find
that
they
were
on
the
edge
of
a
flat
high
plain
a
tableland
the
air
was
pure
and
fresher
the
mules
and
the
travellers
revived
martyn
pony
began
to
trot
briskly
along
so
as
dawn
came
up
they
came
in
sight
of
a
great
courtyard
built
by
the
king
of
that
country
to
refresh
pilgrims
through
night
after
night
they
tramped
across
plateau
and
mountain
range
till
they
climbed
the
third
range
and
then
plunged
by
a
winding
rocky
path
into
a
wide
valley
where
at
a
great
town
called
kazrun
in
a
garden
of
cypress
trees
was
a
martyn
lay
down
on
the
floor
but
could
not
sleep
though
he
was
horribly
weary
there
seemed
he
said
to
be
fire
within
my
head
my
skin
like
a
cinder
his
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
they
went
on
climbing
another
range
of
mountains
first
tormented
by
mosquitoes
then
frozen
with
cold
martyn
was
so
overwhelmed
with
sleep
that
he
could
not
sit
on
his
pony
and
had
to
hurry
ahead
to
keep
awake
and
then
sit
down
with
his
back
against
a
rock
where
he
fell
asleep
in
a
second
and
had
to
be
shaken
to
wake
up
when
zechariah
the
armenian
mule
driver
came
up
to
where
he
was
they
had
at
last
climbed
the
four
mountain
rungs
of
the
ladder
to
persia
and
came
out
on
june
on
the
great
plain
where
the
city
of
shiraz
stands
here
he
found
the
host
jaffir
ali
khan
to
whom
he
carried
his
letters
of
introduction
martyn
in
his
persian
dress
seated
on
the
ground

ali
khan
had
a
lovely
garden
of
orange
trees
and
in
the
garden
martyn
sat
ill
as
he
was
he
worked
day
in
and
day
out
to
translate
the
life
of
jesus
christ
in
the
new
testament
from
the
greek
language
into
pure
and
simple
persian
the
kind
host
put
up
a
tent
for
martyn
in
the
garden
close
to
some
beautiful
vines
from
which
hung
lovely
bunches
of
purple
grapes
by
the
side
of
his
tent
ran
a
clear
stream
of
running
water
all
the
evening
nightingales
sang
sweetly
and
mournfully
as
he
sat
there
at
his
work
men
came
hundreds
of
miles
to
talk
with
this
holy
man
as
they
felt
him
to
be
moslems
they
yet
travelled
even
from
baghdad
and
bosra
and
isfahan
to
hear
this
infidel
speak
of
jesus
christ
and
to
argue
as
to
which
was
the
true
religion
prince
abbas
mirza
invited
him
to
come
to
speak
with
him
and
as
martyn
entered
the
prince
courtyard
a
hundred
fountains
began
to
send
up
jets
of
water
in
his
honour
at
last
they
came
to
him
in
such
numbers
that
martyn
was
obliged
to
say
to
many
of
them
that
he
could
not
see
them
he
hated
sending
them
away
what
was
it
forced
him
to
do
so
race
against
it
was
because
he
was
running
a
race
against
time
he
knew
that
he
could
not
live
very
long
because
the
disease
that
had
smitten
his
lungs
was
gaining
ground
every
day
and
the
thing
that
he
had
come
to
persia
for
the
object
that
had
made
him
face
the
long
voyage
the
frightful
heat
and
the
freezing
cold
of
the
journey
the
life
thousands
of
miles
from
his
home
in
cornwall
was
that
he
might
finish
such
a
translation
of
the
new
testament
into
persian
that
men
should
love
to
read
years
and
years
after
he
had
died
so
each
day
martyn
finished
another
page
or
two
of
the
book
written
in
lovely
persian
letters
he
began
the
work
within
a
week
of
reaching
shiraz
and
in
seven
months
february
it
was
finished
three
more
months
were
spent
in
writing
out
very
beautiful
copies
of
the
whole
of
the
new
testament
in
this
new
translation
to
be
presented
to
the
shah
of
persia
and
to
the
heir
to
the
throne
prince
abbas
mirza
then
he
started
away
on
a
journey
right
across
persia
to
find
the
shah
and
prince
so
that
he
might
give
his
precious
books
to
them
on
the
way
he
fell
ill
with
great
fever
he
was
so
weak
and
giddy
that
he
could
not
stand
one
night
his
head
ached
so
that
it
almost
drove
him
mad
he
shook
all
over
with
fever
then
a
great
sweat
broke
out
he
was
almost
unconscious
with
weakness
but
at
midnight
when
the
call
came
to
start
he
mounted
his
horse
and
as
he
says
set
out
rather
dead
than
alive
so
he
pressed
on
in
great
weakness
till
he
reached
tabriz
and
there
met
the
british
ambassador
martyn
was
rejoiced
and
felt
that
all
his
pains
were
repaid
when
sir
gore
ouseley
said
that
he
himself
would
present
the
sacred
book
to
the
shah
and
the
prince
when
the
day
came
to
give
the
book
to
prince
abbas
poor
henry
martyn
was
so
weak
that
he
could
not
rise
from
his
bed
before
the
other
copy
could
be
presented
to
the
shah
martyn
had
died
this
is
how
it
came
about
last
his
great
work
was
done
the
new
testament
was
finished
he
sent
a
copy
to
the
printers
in
india
he
could
now
go
home
to
england
and
try
to
get
well
again
he
started
out
on
horseback
with
two
armenian
servants
and
a
turkish
guide
he
was
making
along
the
old
track
that
has
been
the
road
from
asia
to
europe
for
thousands
of
years
his
plan
was
to
travel
across
persia
through
armenia
and
over
the
black
sea
to
constantinople
and
so
back
to
england
for
days
he
moved
on
often
going
as
much
as
ninety
miles
and
generally
as
much
as
sixty
in
a
day
he
slept
in
filthy
inns
where
fleas
and
lice
abounded
and
mosquitoes
tormented
him
horses
cows
buffaloes
and
sheep
would
pass
through
his
and
the
stench
of
the
stables
nearly
poisoned
him
yet
he
was
so
ill
that
often
he
could
hardly
keep
his
seat
on
his
horse
he
travelled
through
deep
ravines
and
over
high
mountain
passes
and
across
vast
plains
his
head
ached
till
he
felt
it
would
split
he
could
not
eat
fever
came
on
he
shook
with
ague
yet
his
remorseless
turkish
guide
hassan
dragged
him
along
because
he
wanted
to
get
the
journey
over
and
go
back
home
at
last
one
day
martyn
got
rest
on
damp
ground
in
a
hovel
his
eyes
and
forehead
feeling
as
though
a
great
fire
burnt
in
them
i
was
almost
frantic
he
wrote
martyn
was
in
fact
dying
yet
hassan
compelled
him
to
ride
a
hundred
and
seventy
miles
of
mountain
track
to
tokat
here
on
october
he
wrote
in
his
journal
no
horses
to
be
had
i
had
an
unexpected
repose
i
sat
in
the
orchard
and
thought
with
sweet
comfort
and
peace
of
my
god
in
solitude
my
company
my
friend
my
comforter
it
was
the
last
word
he
was
ever
to
write
alone
without
a
human
friend
by
him
he
fell
asleep
but
the
book
that
he
had
written
with
his
the
persian
new
testament
was
printed
and
has
told
thousands
of
persians
in
far
places
where
no
christian
man
has
penetrated
that
story
of
the
love
of
god
that
is
shown
in
jesus
christ

meet

with

of

land
as
were
the
wrinkled
faces
of
the
turbaned
assyrian
village
men
who
stood
before
him
for
he
was
born
out
here
in
persia
on

seir
and
he
had
lived
here
as
a
boy
and
a
man

for
the
time
when
his
splendid
american
father
had
sent
him
to
marietta
ohio
for
some
of
his
schooling
and
to
princeton
for
his
final
training
his
dark
brown
moustache
and
short
beard
covered
a
firm
mouth
and
a
strong
chin
his
vigorous
expression
and
his
strongly
roman
nose
added
to
the
commanding
effect
of
his
presence
a
haunting
terror
had
driven
these
ragged
village
people
into
the
city
of
urumia
to
ask
help
of
this
wonderful
american
leader
whom
they
almost
worshipped
because
he
was
so
strong
and
just
and
good
for
the
bloodthirsty
turks
and
the
even
more
cruel
and
wilder
kurds
of
the
mountains
were
marching
on
the
land
the
great
war
was
raging
across
the

and
even
the
hidden

were

the

ancient

in

which
in

centuries
had
a

right
across

to
peking

wild
fierce
moslems
the
persians
the
turks
and
the
russians
struggled
together
in
front
of
william
ambrose
shedd
there
stood
an
old
man
from
the
villages
his
long
grey
hair
and
beard
and
his
wrinkled
face
were
agitated
as
he
told
the
american
his
story
the
old
man
dress
was
covered
with
patches
an
eyewitness
counted
patches
all
of
different
colours
on
one
side
of
his
cloak
and
loose
baggy
trousers
my
field
in

village
i
can

he
said
for
we
have
no
ox
the
kurds
have
taken
our
possessions
you
are
our
father
grant
us
an
ox
to
plough
and
draw
for
us
shedd
saw
that
the
old
man
spoke
truth
he
scribbled
a
few
words
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
the
old
man
went
out
satisfied
so
for
hour
after
hour
men
and
women
from
all
the
country
round
came
to
this
strange
missionary
who
had
been
asked
by
the
american
government
to
administer
relief
yes
and
to
be
the
consul
representing
america
itself
in
that
great
territory
they
came
to
him
from
the
villages
where
around
the
fire
in
the
khans
at
night
men
still
tell
stories
of
him
as
one
of
the
great
of
their
race
these
are
the
kind
of
stories
that
they
tell
of
the
courage
and
the
gentleness
of
this
man
who
while
he
was
a
fine
american
scholar
yet
knew
the
very
heart
of
the
eastern
peoples
in
northwestern
persia
as
no
american
has
ever
done
in
all
our
history
one
day
says
one
old
village
assyrian
greybeard
shedd
was
sitting
at
meat
in
his
house
when
his
servant
meshadi
ran
into
the
room
crying
kurds
have
been
among
our
people
they
have
taken
three
girls
three
christian
girls
and
are
carrying
them
off
they
have
just
passed
the
gate
the
kurds
were
all
bristling
with
daggers
and
pistols
shedd
simply
picked
up
the
cane
that
he
holds
in
his
hand
when
he
walks
he
hurried
out
of
the
house
with
meshadi
ran
up
the
hill
to
the
kurd
village
that
lies
there
entered
said
to
the
fierce
kurds
back
those
girls
to
us
and
they
as
they
looked
into
his
face
could
not
resist
him
though
they
were
armed
and
he
was
not
so
they
gave
the
assyrian
girls
back
to
him
and
he
led
them
down
the
hill
to
their
homes
so
he
also
stood
between
turks
and
five
hundred
assyrians
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
missionary
compound
and
stopped
the
turks
from
massacring
the
christians
but
even
as
he
worked
in
this
way
the
tide
of
the
great
war
flowed
towards
urumia
the
people
there
were
mostly
assyrians
with
some
armenians
they
were
christians
they
looked
southward
across
the
mountains
to
the
british
army
there
in
mesopotamia
for
aid
but
as
the
assyrians
looked
up
from
urumia
to
the
north
they
could
already
see
the
first
turks
coming
down
upon
the
city
thousands
upon
thousands
of
the
assyrians
from
the
country
villages
crowded
into
the
city
and
into
the
american
missionary
compound
till
actually
even
in
the
mission
they
were
sleeping
three
deep
one
lot
on
the
floor
another
lot
on
the
seats
of
the
desks
and
a
third
on
the
top
of
the
desks
themselves
hold
on
resist
the
help
of
the
british
will
come
said
shedd
to
the
people
agha
petros
with
a
thousand
of
our
men
has
gone
to
meet
the
british
and
he
will
come
back
with
them
and
will
throw
back
the
turks
the
turks
and
the
kurds
came
on
from
the
north
many
of
the
armenian
and
assyrian
men
were
out
across
the
plains
to
the
east
getting
in
the
harvest
and
no
sign
of
succour
came
from
the
south
ii
through
the
fierce
hot
days
of
july
the
people
held
on
because
shedd
said
that
they
must
but
at
last
on
the
afternoon
of
july
there
came
over
all
the
people
a
strange
irresistible
panic
they
gathered
all
their
goods
together
and
piled
them
in
wagons
food
clothes
saucepans
jewelry
gold
silver
babies
old
women
mothers
all
were
huddled
and
jumbled
together
the
wagons
creaked
the
oxen
lurched
down
the
roads
to
the
south
the
little
children
cried
with
hunger
and
fright
the
boys
trudged
along
rather
excited
at
the
adventure
yet
rather
scared
at
the
awful
hullabaloo
and
the
strange
feeling
of
horror
of
the
cruel
kurdish
horsemen
and
of
the
crafty
turk
shedd
made
one
last
vain
effort
to
persuade
the
people
to
hold
on
to
their
city
but
it
was
impossible
they
had
gone
as
it
seemed
mad
with
fright
he
and
his
wife
went
to
bed
that
night
but
not
to
sleep
at
two
the
telephone
bell
rang
the
turks
and
kurds
are
advancing
all
the
people
are
leaving
came
the
message
it
is
impossible
to
hold
on
any
longer
said
shedd
to
his
wife
i
will
go
and
tell
all
in
the
compound
you
get
things
ready
shedd
got
up
and
began
to
collect
what
was
needed
she
packed
up
food
bread
tea
sugar
nuts
raisins
and
so
on
a
frying
pan
a
kettle
a
saucepan
water
jars
saddles
extra
ropes
lanterns
a
spade
and
bedding
by
the
baggage
wagon
and
two
red
cross
carts
were
ready
shedd
and
shedd
got
up
into
the
wagon
the
driver
cried
to
his
horses
and
they
started
as
they
went
out
of
the
city
on
the
south
the
turks
and
kurds
came
raging
in
on
the
north
within
two
hours
the
turks
and
kurds
were
crashing
into
houses
and
burning
them
to
the
ground
but
most
of
the
people
had
gone
for
shedd
was
practically
the
last
to
leave
urumia
ahead
of
them
were
the
armenians
and
syrians
in
flight
they
came
to
a
little
bridge
a
mass
of
sticks
with
mud
thrown
over
them
here
and
at
every
bridge
pandemonium
reigned
this
is
how
shedd
describes
the
scene
the
jam
at
every
bridge
was
indescribable
confusion
every
kind
of
vehicle
that
you
could
imagine
ox
carts
buffalo
wagons
red
cross
carts
troikas
foorgans
like
prairie
schooners
russian
phaëtons
and
many
others
invented
and
fitted
up
for
the
occasion
the
animals
donkeys
horses
buffaloes
oxen
cows
with
their
calves
mules
and
herds
of
thousands
of
sheep
and
goats
all
through
the
day
they
moved
on
at
the
end
of
the
procession
shedd
planning
out
how
he
could
best
get
his
people
safely
away
from
the
turks
who
he
knew
would
soon
come
pursuing
them
down
the
plain
to
the
mountains
night
fell
and
they
were
in
a
long
line
of
wagons
close
to
a
narrow
bridge
built
by
the
russians
across
the
baranduz
river
they
had
come
some
eighteen
miles
from
urumia
so
they
lay
down
in
the
wagons
to
try
to
sleep
but
they
could
not
and
at
two
in
the
night
they
moved
on
crossed
the
river
and
drove
on
for
hour
after
hour
toward
the
mountains
that
rose
in
a
wall
before
them
the
poor
horses
were
not
strong
so
the
wagon
had
to
be
lightened
assyrian
boys
took
loads
on
their
heads
and
trudged
up
the
rocky
mountain
road
while
the
wagon
jolted
and
groaned
as
it
bumped
its
way
along
the
trail
of
the
mountain
pass
was
littered
with
samovars
tea
urns
copper
kettles
carpets
bedding
and
here
and
there
the
body
of
someone
who
had
died
on
the
way
at
the
very
top
of
the
pass
lay
a
baby
thrown
aside
there
and
just
drawing
its
last
breath
so
for
two
days
they
jolted
on
hardly
getting
an
hour
sleep
at
last
at
midday
on
the
third
day
they
left
hadarabad
at
the
south
end
of
lake
urumia
two
hours
later
the
sound
of
booming
guns
was
heard
a
horseman
galloped
up
the
turks
are
in
hadarabad
he
said
they
are
attacking
the
rear
of
the
procession
it
seemed
said
shedd
as
if
at
any
moment
we
should
hear
the
screams
of
those
behind
as
the
enemy
fell
upon
them
the
wagons
hurried
on
to
the
next
town
called
memetyar
and
there
shedd
waited
lightening
his
own
wagons
by
throwing
away
everything
that
they
could
spare
oil
potatoes
charcoal
every
box
except
his
bible
and
a
small
volume
of
browning
poems
then
they
started
again
along
a
road
that
was
littered
with
the
discarded
goods
of
the
people
then
they
saw
on
the
a
little
baby
girl
that
had
been
left
by
her
parents
she
was
not
a
year
old
and
sat
there
all
alone
in
a
desolate
spot
left
to
die
shedd
looked
at
his
wife
and
she
at
him
he
pulled
up
the
horse
and
jumped
down
picked
up
the
baby
and
put
her
in
the
wagon
they
went
along
till
they
came
to
a
large
village
here
they
found
a
kurdish
mother
take
care
of
this
little
girl
till
we
come
back
said
shedd
and
here
is
some
money
for
looking
after
her
we
will
give
you
more
when
we
come
back
if
she
is
well
looked
after
iii
suddenly
cannon
were
fired
from
the
mountains
and
the
people
in
panic
threw
away
their
goods
and
hurried
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
down
the
mountain
passes
they
passed
on
to
the
plain
and
then
as
they
were
in
a
village
guns
began
to
be
fired
three
hundred
turks
and
persians
were
attacking
under
majdi
sultana
of
urumia
shedd
riding
his
horse
gathered
together
some
armenian
and
assyrian
men
with
guns
and
stayed
with
them
to
help
them
hold
back
the
enemy
while
the
women
drove
on
he
was
a
good
target
sitting
up
there
on
his
horse
but
without
thinking
of
his
own
danger
he
kept
his
men
at
it
for
he
felt
like
a
shepherd
with
a
great
flock
of
fleeing
sheep
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
protect
panic
seized
the
people
strong
men
left
their
old
mothers
to
die
mothers
dropped
their
babies
and
ran
one
of
my
shedd
says
afterward
told
me
how
she
had
left
her
baby
on
the
bank
and
waded
with
an
older
child
through
the
river
when
the
enemy
were
coming
after
them
she
could
carry
both
the
memory
of
her
deserted
baby
is
always
with
her
the
line
of
the
refugees
stretched
for
miles
along
the
road
the
enemy
fired
from
behind
boulders
on
the
mountain
sides
the
armenians
and
syrians
fired
back
from
the
road
or
ran
up
the
mountains
to
chase
them
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
driving
the
enemy
off
but
shedd
object
was
to
hold
them
off
till
help
came
so
he
went
up
and
down
on
his
horse
encouraging
the
men
while
the
bullets
whizzed
over
the
wagons
i
feared
said
shedd
that
the
enemy
might
get
the
better
of
us
and
we
should
have
to
leave
the
carts
and
run
for
our
lives
while
they
were
plundering
the
wagons
and
the
loads
we
would
get
away
i
looked
about
me
to
see
what
we
might
carry
there
was
little
may
six
years
old
the
daughter
of
one
of
their
syrian
teachers
who
had
unconcernedly
curled
herself
up
on
the
seat
for
a
nap
i
wrapped
a
little
bread
in
a
cloth
put
my
glasses
in
my
pocket
and
took
the
bag
of
money
so
that
i
should
be
ready
on
a
moment
notice
for
shedd
if
they
should
swoop
down
upon
us
all
day
long
the
firing
went
on
from
the
mountain
side
as
the
tired
horses
pulled
along
the
rough
trail
the
sun
began
to
sink
toward
the
horizon
what
would
happen
in
the
darkness
then
they
saw
ahead
of
them
coming
from
the
south
a
group
of
men
in
khaki
they
were
nine
british
tommies
with
three
lewis
guns
under
captain
savage
they
had
come
ahead
from
the
main
body
that
had
moved
up
from
baghdad
in
order
to
defend
the
rear
of
the
great
procession
the
little
company
of
soldiers
passed
on
and
the
procession
moved
forward
that
tiny
company
of
nine
british
tommies
ten
miles
farther
on
was
attacked
by
hundreds
of
turks
all
day
they
held
the
road
like
horatius
on
the
bridge
till
at
night
the
cavalry
came
up
and
drove
off
the
enemy
and
at
last
the
shedds
reached
the
british
camp
why
are
you
right
at
the
tail
end
of
the
retreat
asked
one
of
the
syrian
young
men
who
had
hurried
forward
into
safety
i
would
much
rather
be
there
said
shedd
with
some
scorn
in
his
voice
than
like
you
leave
the
unarmed
the
sick
the
weak
the
women
and
the
children
to
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
he
was
rejoiced
that
the
british
had
come
there
was
said
shedd
a
ring
in
his
voice
a
light
in
his
eyes
a
buoyancy
in
his
step
that
i
had
not
seen
for
months
he
had
shepherded
his
thousands
and
thousands
of
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
through
the
mountains
into
the
protection
of
the
british
squadron
of
troops
iv
later
that
day
shedd
began
to
feel
the
frightful
heat
of
the
august
day
so
exhausting
that
he
had
to
lie
down
in
the
cart
which
had
a
canvas
cover
open
at
both
ends
and
was
therefore
much
cooler
than
a
tent
he
got
more
and
more
feverish
so
shedd
got
the
assyrian
boys
to
take
out
the
baggage
and
she
made
up
a
bed
for
him
on
the
floor
of
the
cart
the
english
doctor
was
out
with
the
cavalry
who
were
holding
back
and
dispersing
the
turkish
force
then
a
british
officer
came
and
said
we
are
moving
the
camp
forward
under
the
protection
of
the
mountains
it
was
late
afternoon
the
cart
moved
forward
into
the
gathering
darkness
shedd
crouched
beside
her
husband
on
the
floor
of
the
cart
attending
to
him
expecting
the
outriders
to
tell
her
when
they
came
to
the
british
camp
for
hours
the
cart
rolled
and
jolted
over
the
rough
mountain
roads
at
last
it
stopped
it
was
so
dark
they
could
not
see
the
road
they
were
in
a
gully
and
could
not
go
forward
where
is
the
british
camp
asked
shedd
we
passed
it
miles
back
on
the
road
was
the
reply
it
was
a
terrible
blow
the
doctor
the
medicines
the
comfort
the
nursing
that
would
have
helped
shedd
were
all
miles
away
and
he
was
so
ill
that
it
was
impossible
to
drive
him
back
over
that
rough
mountain
track
in
the
inky
darkness
of
the
night
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
just
stay
where
they
were
send
a
messenger
to
the
camp
for
the
doctor
and
wait
for
the
morning
only
a
few
drops
of
oil
were
left
in
the
lantern
shedd
tells
us
but
i
lighted
it
and
looked
at
shedd
i
could
see
that
he
was
very
sick
indeed
and
asked
two
of
the
men
to
go
back
for
the
doctor
it
was
midnight
before
the
doctor
reached
us
the
men
shedd
continues
set
fire
to
a
deserted
cart
left
by
the
refugees
and
this
furnished
fire
and
light
all
night
they
arranged
for
guards
in
turn
and
lay
down
to
rest
on
the
roadside
hour
after
hour
i
crouched
in
the
cart
beside
my
husband
massaging
his
limbs
when
cramps
attacked
him
giving
him
water
frequently
for
while
he
was
very
cold
to
the
touch
he
seemed
feverish
we
heated
the
hot
water
bottle
for
his
feet
and
made
coffee
for
him
at
the
blaze
we
had
no
other
nourishment
he
got
weaker
and
weaker
and
a
terrible
fear
tugged
at
my
heart
fifty
thousand
hunted
refugees
had
passed
on
the
desolate
rocky
mountains
loomed
above
us
darkness
was
all
about
us
and
heaven
seemed
too
far
away
for
prayer
to
reach
a
deserted
baby
wailed
all
night
not
far
away
when
the
doctor
came
he
gave
two
hypodermic
injections
and
returned
to
the
camp
saying
we
should
wait
there
for
him
to
catch
up
to
us
in
the
morning
after
the
injections
shedd
rested
better
but
he
did
not
again
regain
consciousness
when
the
light
began
to
reveal
things
i
could
see
the
awful
change
in
his
face
but
i
could
not
believe
that
he
was
leaving
me
shortly
after
light
the
men
told
me
that
we
could
not
wait
as
they
heard
fighting
behind
and
it
was
evident
the
english
were
attacked
so
in
his
dying
hour
we
had
to
take
him
over
the
rough
stony
road
after
an
hour
or
two
capt
reed
and
the
doctor
caught
up
to
us
we
drew
the
cart
to
the
side
of
the
road
where
soon
he
drew
a
few
short
sharp
breaths
and
i
was
alone
so
the
british
officers
with
a
little
hoe
on
the
mountain
side
dug
the
grave
of
this
brave
american
shepherd
who
had
given
his
life
in
defending
the
assyrian
flock
from
the
turkish
wolf
they
made
the
grave
just
above
the
road
beside
a
rock
and
on
it
they
sprinkled
dead
grass
so
that
it
might
not
be
seen
and
polluted
by
the
enemy
the
people
shedd
loved
were
safe
the
enemy
whose
bullets
he
had
braved
for
day
after
day
was
defeated
by
the
british
soldiers
but
the
great
american
leader
whose
tired
body
had
not
slept
while
the
assyrians
and
armenians
were
being
hunted
through
the
mountains
lies
there
dreamless
on
the
mountain
side
these
are
words
that
broke
from
the
lips
of
assyrian
sheiks
when
they
heard
of
his
death
he
bore
the
burdens
of
the
whole
nation
upon
his
shoulders
to
the
last
breath
of
his
life
as
long
as
we
obeyed
his
advice
and
followed
his
lead
we
were
safe
and
prosperous
but
when
we
ceased
to
do
that
destruction
came
upon
us
he
was
and
ever
will
be
the
moses
of
the
assyrian
people
he
lies
there
where
his
heart
always
was
in
that
land
in
which
the
turk
the
assyrian
the
armenian
the
persian
the
russian
and
the
arab
meet
he
is
there
waiting
for
the
others
who
will
go
out
and
take
up
the
work
that
he
has
left
the
work
of

were
at

the
tinkle
of
as
a
caravan
of
laden
beasts
swung
by
the
quick
of
donkeys
hoofs
the
howl
of
a
turkish
dog
the
cry
of

these
and
other
sounds
of
the
city
came
through
the
open
window
of
the
ward
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
ward
lay
a
bearded
man
a
turk
who
lived
in
this
ancient
city
of
konia
the
iconium
of
paul
day
his
brown
face
and
grizzled
beard
were
oddly
framed
in
the
white
of
the
spotless
pillow
and
sheets
his
face
turned
to
the
door
as
it
opened
and
the
matron
entered
the
eyes
of
the
turk
as
he
lay
there
followed
her
as
she
walked
toward
one
of
her
deft
assistant
nurses
who
in
their
neat
uniforms
with
their
faces
framed
in
dark
hair
went
from
bed
to
bed
tending
the
patients
giving
medicine
to
a
boy
here
shaking
up
a
pillow
for
a
sick
man
there
taking
a
temperature
yonder
those
skilled
nurses
were
armenian
girls
the
armenians
are
a
christian
nation
who
have
been
ruled
by
the
turks
for
centuries
and
often
have
been
massacred
by
them
yet
these
armenian
girls
were
nursing
the
turks
in
the
hospital
but
the
matron
of
the
hospital
was
not
a
turk
nor
an
armenian
she
had
come
four
thousand
miles
across
the
sea
to
heal
the
turks
and
the
armenians
in
this
land
she
was
an
american
the
turk
in
bed
turned
his
eyes
from
the
nurses
to
a
picture
on
the
wall
a
frown
came
on
his
face
he
began
to
mutter
angry
words
into
his
beard
as
a
turk
he
had
always
been
taught
even
as
a
little
boy
that
the
great
prophet
mohammed
had
told
them
they
must
have
no
pictures
of
prophets
and
he
knew
from
what
he
had
heard
that
the
picture
on
the
wall
showed
the
face
of
a
prophet
it
was
a
picture
of
a
man
with
a
kind
strong
face
dressed
in
garments
of
the
lands
of
the
east
and
wearing
a
short
beard
he
was
stooping
down
healing
a
little
child
it
was
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
great
physician
as
miss
cushman
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
matron
moved
toward
his
bed
the
turk
burst
into
angry
speech
have
that
picture
taken
down
he
said
roughly
pointing
to
it
she
turned
to
look
at
the
picture
and
then
back
at
him
and
said
words
like
these
no
that
is
the
picture
of
jesus
the
great
doctor
who
lived
long
ago
and
taught
the
people
that
god
is
love
it
is
because
he
taught
that
and
has
called
me
to
follow
in
his
steps
that
i
am
here
to
help
to
heal
you
but
the
turk
who
was
not
used
to
having
women
disobey
his
commands
again
ordered
angrily
that
the
picture
should
be
taken
down
but
the
american
said
gently
but
firmly
no
the
picture
must
stay
there
to
remind
us
of
jesus
if
you
can
not
endure
to
see
the
picture
there
then
if
you
wish
you
may
leave
the
hospital
of
course
and
so
she
passed
on
the
turk
lay
in
his
bed
and
thought
it
over
he
wished
to
get
well
if
the
doctors
in
this
hospital
dodd
and
post
did
not
attend
him
and
if
the
nurses
did
not
give
him
his
medicine
he
would
not
he
therefore
decided
to
make
no
more
fuss
about
the
picture
so
he
lay
looking
at
it
and
was
rather
surprised
to
find
in
a
few
days
that
he
liked
to
see
it
there
and
that
he
wanted
to
hear
more
and
more
about
the
great
jesus
then
he
had
another
tussle
of
wills
with
miss
cushman
the
white
nurse
from
across
the
seas
it
came
about
in
this
way
women
who
are
mohammedans
keep
their
faces
veiled
but
the
armenian
christian
nurses
had
their
faces
uncovered
surely
they
are
shameless
women
he
thought
in
his
heart
and
they
are
armenians
too
christian
infidels
so
he
began
to
treat
them
rudely
but
the
white
nurse
would
not
stand
that
miss
cushman
went
and
stood
by
his
bed
and
said
i
want
you
to
remember
that
these
nurses
of
mine
are
here
to
help
you
to
get
well
they
are
to
you
even
as
daughters
tending
their
father
and
you
must
behave
to
them
as
a
good
father
to
good
daughters
so
the
turk
lay
in
bed
and
thought
about
that
also
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
take
it
in
for
he
had
always
been
taught
to
hate
the
armenians
and
to
think
low
thoughts
about
their
womenfolk
but
in
the
end
he
learnt
that
lesson
also
at
last
the
turk
got
well
left
his
bed
and
went
away
he
was
so
thankful
that
he
was
better
that
he
was
ready
to
do
just
anything
in
the
world
that
miss
cushman
wanted
him
to
do
the
days
passed
on
in
the
hospital
and
always
the
white
nurse
from
across
the
seas
and
the
armenian
nurses
tended
the
turkish
and
other
patients
and
healed
them
through
the
heats
of
that
summer
and
as
summer
came
near
to
its
end
there
broke
on
the
world
the
dreadful
day
when
all
europe
went
to
war
miss
cushman
colleagues
the
american
doctors
at
the
hospital
left
konia
for
service
in
the
war
soon
turkey
entered
the
war
the
fury
of
the
turks
against
the
armenians
burst
out
into
a
flame
you
might
see
in
konia
two
or
three
turks
sitting
in
the
shadow
of
a
little
saddler
shop
by
the
street
smoking
their
and
saying
words
like
these
the
armenians
are
plotting
to
help
the
enemies
of
turkey
we
shall
have
to
kill
them
all
yes
wipe
them
out
the
accursed
infidels
the
turks
hate
the
armenians
because
their
religion
islam
teaches
them
to
hate
the
infidel
christians
they
are
of
a
foreign
race
and
foreign
religion
in
countries
ruled
by
turks
though
the
armenians
were
there
first
and
the
armenians
are
cleverer
business
men
than
the
turks
who
hate
to
see
their
subjects
richer
than
themselves
and
hope
by
massacre
to
seize
armenian
wealth
yet
all
the
time
as
the
wounded
turks
were
sent
from
the
gallipoli
front
back
to
konia
the
armenian
nurses
in
the
hospital
there
were
healing
them
but
the
turkish
government
gave
its
orders
vile
bands
of
turkish
soldiers
rushed
down
on
the
different
cities
and
villages
of
the
armenians
one
sunny
morning
a
troop
of
turkish
soldiers
came
dashing
into
a
quiet
little
armenian
town
among
the
hills
an
order
was
given
the
turks
smashed
in
the
doors
of
the
houses
a
father
stood
up
before
his
family
a
bayonet
was
driven
through
him
and
soldiers
dashed
over
his
dead
body
they
looted
the
house
they
smashed
up
his
home
others
seized
the
mother
and
the
daughters
the
mother
had
a
baby
in
her
arms
the
baby
was
flung
on
the
ground
and
then
picked
up
dead
on
the
point
of
a
bayonet
and
though
the
mother
and
daughters
were
not
bayoneted
then
it
would
have
been
better
to
die
at
once
than
to
suffer
the
unspeakable
horrors
that
came
to
them
and
that
happened
in
hundreds
of
villages
and
cities
to
hundred
of
thousands
of
armenians
while
hundreds
of
thousands
more
scattered
down
the
mountain
passes
in
flight
towards
konia
orphan
boys
and
as
miss
cushman
and
her
armenian
nurses
looked
out
through
the
windows
of
the
hospital
their
hearts
were
sad
as
they
saw
some
of
these
armenian
refugees
trailing
along
the
road
like
walking
skeletons
what
was
to
happen
to
them
it
was
very
dangerous
for
anyone
to
show
that
they
were
friends
with
the
armenians
but
the
white
matron
was
as
brave
as
she
was
kind
so
she
went
out
to
do
what
she
could
to
help
them
one
day
she
saw
a
little
boy
so
thin
that
the
bones
seemed
almost
to
be
coming
through
his
skin
he
was
very
dirty
his
hair
was
all
matted
together
and
there
were
bugs
and
fleas
in
his
clothes
and
in
his
hair
the
hospital
was
so
full
that
not
another
could
be
taken
in
but
the
boy
would
certainly
die
if
he
were
not
looked
after
properly
his
father
and
his
mother
had
both
been
slain
by
the
turks
he
did
not
know
where
his
brothers
were
he
was
an
orphan
alone
in
all
the
world
miss
cushman
knew
armenian
people
in
konia
and
she
went
to
one
of
these
homes
and
told
them
about
the
poor
boy
and
arranged
to
pay
them
some
money
for
the
cost
of
his
food
so
she
made
a
new
home
for
him
the
next
day
she
found
another
boy
and
then
a
girl
and
so
she
went
on
and
on
discovering
little
orphan
armenian
boys
and
girls
who
had
nobody
to
care
for
them
and
finding
them
homes
until
she
had
over
six
hundred
orphans
being
cared
for
it
is
certain
that
nearly
all
of
them
would
have
died
if
she
had
not
looked
after
them
so
miss
cushman
gathered
the
six
hundred
armenian
children
together
into
an
orphanage
that
was
half
for
the
boys
and
half
for
the
girls
she
was
a
hundred
times
better
than
the
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
because
though
she
had
so
many
children
she
know
what
to
do
she
taught
them
to
make
nearly
everything
for
themselves
in
the
mornings
you
would
see
half
the
boys
figuring
away
at
their
sums
or
learning
to
write
and
read
while
the
other
boys
were
hammering
and
sawing
and
planing
at
the
carpenter
bench
cutting
leather
and
sewing
it
to
make
shoes
for
the
other
boys
and
girls
cutting
petrol
tins
up
into
sheets
to
solder
into
kettles
and
saucepans
and
cutting
and
stitching
cloth
to
make
clothes
a
young
american
red
cross
officer
who
went
to
see
them
wrote
home
the
kids
look
happy
and
healthy
and
as
clean
as
a
whistle
people
on
the
as
miss
cushman
looked
out
again
from
the
hospital
window
she
saw
men
coming
from
the
country
into
the
city
jogging
along
on
little
donkeys
in
the
villages
all
across
the
plain
they
said
to
her
are
armenian
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
they
are
starving
many
are
without
homes
wandering
about
in
rags
till
they
simply
lie
down
on
the
ground
worn
out
and
die
miss
cushman
sent
word
to
friends
far
away
in
america
and
they
sent
food
from
america
to
turkey
in
ships
and
a
million
dollars
of
money
to
help
the
starving
children
so
miss
cushman
got
together
her
boys
and
girls
and
some
other
helpers
and
soon
they
were
very
busy
all
day
and
every
day
wrapping
food
and
clothes
into
parcels
next
a
caravan
of
snorting
camels
came
swinging
in
to
the
courtyard
and
grumbling
and
rumbling
knelt
down
to
be
loaded
up
the
parcels
were
done
up
in
big
bales
and
strapped
on
to
the
camels
backs
then
at
a
word
from
the
driver
the
camels
rose
from
their
knees
and
went
lurching
out
from
konia
into
the
country
over
the
rough
rolling
tracks
to
carry
to
the
people
the
food
and
clothes
that
would
keep
them
alive
the
wonderful
thing
is
that
these
camels
were
led
by
a
turk
belonging
to
the
people
who
hate
the
armenians
yet
he
was
carrying
food
and
clothes
to
them
why
did
this
turk
in
konia
go
on
countless
journeys
travelling
over
thousands
of
miles
with
tens
of
thousands
of
parcels
containing
wheat
for
bread
and
new
shirts
and
skirts
and
other
clothes
for
the
armenians
whom
he
had
always
hated
and
never
lose
a
single
parcel
why
did
he
do
it
this
is
the
reason
before
the
war
when
he
was
ill
in
the
hospital
miss
cushman
had
nursed
him
with
the
help
of
her
armenian
girls
and
had
made
him
better
he
was
so
thankful
that
he
would
just
run
to
do
anything
that
she
wished
him
to
do
stay
or
not
to
stay
but
at
last
miss
cushman
worn
out
with
all
this
work
fell
ill
with
a
terrible
fever
for
some
time
it
was
not
certain
that
she
would
not
die
of
it
for
a
whole
month
she
lay
sick
in
great
weakness
president
wilson
had
at
this
time
broken
off
relations
between
america
and
turkey
the
turk
now
thought
of
the
american
as
an
enemy
and
miss
cushman
was
an
american
she
was
in
peril
what
was
she
to
do
it
is
not
safe
to
stay
said
her
friends
you
will
be
practically
a
prisoner
of
war
you
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
turks
you
know
what
the
turk
is
as
treacherous
as
he
is
cruel
they
can
if
they
wish
rob
you
or
deport
you
anywhere
they
like
go
now
while
the
path
is
open
before
it
is
too
late
you
are
in
the
very
middle
of
turkey
hundreds
of
miles
from
any
help
the
dangers
are
terrible
as
soon
as
she
was
well
enough
miss
cushman
went
to
the
turkish
governor
of
konia
a
bitter
mohammedan
who
had
organised
the
massacre
of
forty
thousand
armenians
to
say
that
she
had
been
asked
to
go
back
to
america
what
shall
you
do
if
i
stay
she
asked
i
beg
you
to
stay
said
the
governor
you
shall
be
protected
you
need
have
no
fear
your
words
are
beautiful
she
replied
but
if
american
and
turkey
go
to
war
you
will
deport
me
if
she
stayed
she
knew
the
risks
under
his
rule
she
was
still
weak
from
her
illness
there
was
no
colleague
by
her
side
to
help
her
there
seemed
to
be
every
reason
why
she
should
sail
away
back
to
america
but
as
she
sat
thinking
it
over
she
saw
before
her
the
hospital
full
of
wounded
soldiers
the
six
hundred
orphans
who
looked
to
her
for
help
the
plain
of
a
hundred
villages
to
which
she
was
sending
food
no
one
could
take
her
place
yet
she
was
weak
and
tired
after
her
illness
and
in
america
rest
and
home
friends
and
safety
called
to
her
it
was
she
wrote
later
to
her
friends
a
heavy
problem
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
orphans
and
other
helpless
people
who
depended
on
me
for
life
what
would
you
have
done
what
do
you
think
she
did
for
what
reason
should
she
face
these
perils
not
in
the
heat
of
battle
but
in
cool
quiet
thought
all
alone
among
enemies
she
saw
her
path
and
took
it
she
did
not
count
her
life
her
own
she
was
ready
to
give
her
life
for
her
friends
of
all
nations
she
decided
to
stay
in
the
heart
of
the
enemies
country
and
serve
her
god
and
the
children
many
a
man
has
had
the
cross
of
honour
for
an
act
that
called
for
less
calm
courage
that
deed
showed
her
to
be
one
of
the
great
undecorated
heroes
and
heroines
of
the
lonely
path
so
she
stayed
on
from
all
over
the
turkish
empire
prisoners
were
sent
to
konia
there
was
great
confusion
in
dealing
with
them
so
the
people
of
konia
asked
miss
cushman
to
look
after
them
they
even
wrote
to
the
turkish
government
at
constantinople
to
tell
them
to
write
to
her
to
invite
her
to
do
this
work
there
was
a
regular
hue
and
cry
that
she
should
be
appointed
because
everyone
knew
her
strong
will
her
power
of
organising
her
just
treatment
her
good
judgment
and
her
loving
heart
so
at
last
she
accepted
the
invitation
prisoners
of
eleven
different
nationalities
she
helped
including
british
french
italian
russian
indians
and
arabs
she
arranged
for
the
nursing
of
the
sick
the
feeding
of
the
hungry
the
freeing
of
some
from
prison
she
went
on
right
through
the
war
to
the
end
and
beyond
the
end
caring
for
her
orphans
looking
after
the
sick
in
hospital
sending
food
and
clothes
to
all
parts
of
the
country
helping
the
prisoners
without
caring
whether
they
were
british
or
turkish
armenian
or
indian
she
gave
her
help
to
those
who
needed
it
and
because
of
her
splendid
courage
thousands
of
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
are
alive
and
well
who
without
her
would
have
starved
and
frozen
to
death
in
and
around
konia
an
army
officer
who
has
been
there
tells
us
the
people
do
not
say
if
allah
wills
but
if
miss
cushman
wills
it
is
that
officer
way
of
letting
us
see
how
through
her
brave
daring
her
love
and
her
hard
work
that
served
everybody
british
armenian
turk
indian
and
arab
she
has
become
the
uncrowned
queen
of
konia
whose
bidding
all
the
people
do
because
she
only
cares
to
serve
them
not
counting
her
own
life
dear
to
her
footnotes
footnote
in
reading
this
part
of
the
story
to
younger
children
discretion
should
be
exercised
some
of
the
details
on
this
page
are
horrible
but
it
is
right
that
older
children
should
realize
the
evil
and
how
miss
cushman
courage
faced
it
chapter
xxvii
on
the
desert
camel
trail
time
of
incident
boy
who
an
schoolboy
sat
one
evening
in
a
crowded
meeting
in
salisbury
his
eyes
wide
open
with
wonder
as
he
heard
a
bronzed
and
bearded
man
on
the
platform
telling
of
his
adventures
in
africa
the
man
was
robert
moffat
it
was
a
hot
summer
night
in
august
the
walls
of
the
building
where
the
meeting
was
held
seemed
to
have
disappeared
and
the
boy
archibald
forder
could
in
imagination
see
the
plain
of
a
thousand
villages
that
livingstone
had
seen
when
this
same
robert
moffat
had
called
him
to
africa
many
years
before
as
the
boy
archibald
heard
moffat
he
too
wished
to
go
out
into
the
foreign
field
many
things
happened
as
he
grew
up
but
he
never
forgot
that
evening
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
left
home
and
was
apprenticed
to
the
grocery
and
baking
business
in
he
married
at
this
time
he
read
in
a
magazine
about
missionary
work
in
kerak
beyond
the
river
jordan
in
moab
among
the
arabs
where
a
young
married
man
ready
to
rough
it
was
needed
he
sailed
with
his
wife
for
kerak
on
september
and
left
jerusalem
by
camel
on
september
on
the
four
days
journey
across
jordan
to
kerak
three
times
they
were
robbed
by
brigands
on
this
journey
forder
worked
there
till
he
then
left
and
travelled
through
america
to
secure
support
for
an
attempt
to
penetrate
central
arabia
with
the
first
effort
to
carry
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
there
the
story
that
follows
tells
how
forder
made
his
pioneer
journey
into
the
arabian
desert
adventure
into
the
two
were
stamping
their
hoofs
impatiently
outside
a
house
in
jerusalem
in
the
early
morning
a
week
or
two
before
christmas
inside
the
house
a
man
was
saying
to
his
wife
and
his
three
children
he
was
dressed
as
an
arab
with
a
long
scarf
wrapped
about
his
head
and
on
the
top
the
black
rope
of
twisted
goats
hair
that
the
arab
puts
on
when
he
becomes
a
man
will
you
be
long
father
asked
his
little
boy
the
father
could
not
answer
for
he
was
going
out
from
jerusalem
for
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
sun
and
the
thirst
of
the
desert
to
the
land
of
the
fiercest
arabs
moslems
whose
religion
tells
them
that
they
must
kill
the
infidel
christians
it
was
difficult
to
tear
himself
from
his
wife
and
his
children
and
go
out
to
face
death
in
the
desert
but
he
had
come
out
here
to
carry
to
the
arab
the
story
of
jesus
christ
who
himself
had
died
on
a
cross
outside
this
very
city
so
he
kissed
his
little
boy
wrenched
himself
away
climbed
on
top
of
the
load
on
one
of
the
pack
horses
and
rode
out
through
the
gate
into
the
unknown
he
thought
as
his
horses
picked
their
way
down
the
road
from
jerusalem
toward
jericho
of
how
jesus
christ
had
been
put
to
death
in
this
very
land
over
his
left
shoulder
he
saw
the
slopes
of
the
mount
of
olives
down
below
across
the
ravine
on
his
right
was
the
garden
of
gethsemane
in
a
short
time
he
was
passing
through
bethany
where
mary
and
martha
lived
down
the
steep
winding
road
amongst
the
rocks
he
went
and
took
a
cup
of
cold
water
at
the
inn
of
the
good
samaritan
then
with
the
wilderness
of
desolation
stretching
its
tawny
tumbled
desert
hills
away
to
the
left
he
moved
onward
down
and
down
until
the
road
came
out
a
thousand
feet
below
among
the
huts
and
sheepfolds
of
jericho
where
he
slept
that
night
with
his
face
toward
the
dawn
that
came
up
over
the
hills
of
moab
in
the
distance
he
was
off
again
over
the
plain
with
the
dead
sea
on
his
right
across
the
swiftly
flowing
jordan
and
climbing
the
ravines
that
lead
into
the
mountains
of
gilead
that
night
he
stayed
with
a
circassian
family
in
a
little
house
of
only
one
room
into
which
were
crowded
his
two
horses
a
mule
two
donkeys
a
yoke
of
oxen
some
sheep
and
goats
a
crowd
of
cocks
and
hens
four
small
dirty
children
and
their
father
and
mother
and
a
great
multitude
of
fleas
the
mother
fried
him
a
supper
of
eggs
with
bread
and
after
it
he
showed
them
something
that
they
had
never
seen
before
he
took
out
of
his
pack
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
translated
into
arabic
he
read
bits
out
of
it
and
talked
to
them
about
the
love
of
god
early
next
morning
his
stuffed
with
a
batch
of
loaves
which
the
woman
had
baked
first
thing
in
the
morning
specially
for
him
he
set
out
again
how
could
a
whole
batch
of
loaves
be
stuffed
in
one
the
loaves
are
flat
and
circular
like
a
pancake
the
dough
is
spread
on
a
kind
of
cushion
the
woman
takes
up
the
cushion
with
the
dough
on
it
pushes
it
through
the
opening
and
slaps
the
dough
on
the
inner
wall
of
a
big
mud
oven
out
of
doors
that
has
been
heated
with
a
fire
of
twigs
and
in
a
minute
or
two
pushes
the
cushion
in
again
and
the
cooked
bread
falls
on
to
it
so
forder
climbed
up
the
mountain
track
till
he
came
out
on
the
high
plain
he
saw
the
desert
in
front
of
him
like
a
vast
rolling
ocean
of
glowing
gold
it
stretched
away
and
away
for
close
on
a
thousand
miles
eastward
to
the
persian
gulf
forder
knew
that
only
here
and
there
in
all
those
blazing
sandy
wastes
were
oases
where
men
could
build
their
houses
round
some
well
or
little
stream
that
soon
lost
itself
in
the
sand
all
the
rest
was
desert
across
which
man
and
beast
must
hurry
or
die
of
thirst
he
must
follow
the
from
oasis
to
oasis
where
they
could
find
a
well
of
water
therefore
drink
for
man
and
camel
and
so
turning
north
he
pressed
on
till
on
the
sixth
day
out
from
jerusalem
the
clouds
came
up
with
the
dawn
and
hail
and
rain
carried
by
a
biting
east
wind
beat
down
upon
him
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
horizon
he
saw
ahead
the
sturdy
castle
and
thick
walls
of
the
ancient
city
of
bosra
stumbling
through
the
storm
along
the
narrow
winding
streets
he
met
to
his
disgust
a
man
whose
dress
showed
that
he
was
a
turkish
government
official
he
knew
that
the
turkish
government
would
be
against
a
christian
and
a
foreigner
going
into
their
land
who
are
you
asked
the
official
stopping
him
where
are
you
from
where
are
you
going
forder
told
him
and
the
man
said
come
with
me
i
will
find
you
and
your
horses
shelter
at
the
governor
house
forder
followed
him
into
a
large
room
in
the
middle
of
which
on
the
floor
a
fire
was
burning
i
must
examine
all
your
cases
said
the
official
get
up
open
your
boxes
never
said
forder
this
is
not
a
your
boxes
are
full
of
powder
for
arming
the
arabs
against
the
turkish
government
replied
the
official
i
will
not
open
them
said
forder
unless
you
bring
me
written
orders
from
the
turkish
governor
in
damascus
and
from
the
british
consul
off
went
the
official
to
consult
the
headman
the
equivalent
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
the
headman
came
and
asked
many
questions
at
last
he
said
well
my
orders
are
to
turn
back
all
europeans
and
not
to
let
any
stay
in
these
parts
however
as
you
seem
to
be
almost
an
arab
may
god
go
with
you
and
give
you
peace
so
forder
and
the
headman
of
the
ancient
city
of
bosra
got
talking
together
forder
opened
his
satchel
and
drew
out
an
arabic
new
testament
and
together
they
read
parts
of
the
story
of
the
life
of
jesus
christ
and
talked
about
him
till
ten
at
night
as
the
headman
rose
to
go
to
his
own
rooms
forder
offered
to
him
and
he
gladly
took
the
copy
of
the
new
testament
in
arabic
to
read
for
himself
by
the
next
morning
early
forder
had
his
horses
loaded
and
started
off
with
his
face
to
the
dawn
the
track
now
led
toward
the
great
castle
of
sulkhund
which
he
saw
looming
up
on
the
horizon
miles
away
against
the
dull
sky
but
mist
came
down
wind
rain
and
hail
buffeted
him
the
horses
to
escape
the
hail
in
their
faces
turned
aside
and
the
trail
was
lost
mist
hid
everything
forder
compass
showed
that
he
was
going
south
so
he
turned
east
again
but
he
could
not
strike
the
narrow
broken
stony
trail
suddenly
smoke
could
be
seen
and
then
a
hamlet
of
thirty
houses
loomed
up
forder
opened
a
door
and
a
voice
came
calling
welcome
he
went
in
and
saw
some
arabs
crouching
there
out
of
the
rain
a
fire
of
dried
manure
was
made
the
smoke
made
forder
eyes
smart
and
the
tears
run
down
his
cheeks
he
changed
into
another
man
clothes
and
hung
his
own
up
in
the
smoke
to
dry
where
are
we
he
asked
the
men
told
him
that
he
was
about
two
and
a
half
hours
ride
from
the
castle
and
two
hours
off
the
track
that
he
had
left
in
the
mist
the
men
came
in
from
the
other
little
houses
to
see
the
stranger
and
sip
coffee
forder
again
brought
out
an
arabic
new
testament
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
some
of
the
men
could
read
quite
well
and
were
very
keen
on
his
books
so
they
bought
some
of
the
bibles
from
him
they
had
no
money
but
paid
him
in
dried
figs
flour
and
eggs
at
last
they
left
him
to
curl
up
on
the
hard
floor
and
in
spite
of
the
cold
and
draughts
and
the
many
fleas
he
soon
fell
asleep
as
dawn
came
up
he
rose
and
started
off
there
as
he
climbed
out
of
the
hollow
in
which
the
hamlet
lay
he
could
see
the
castle
sulkhund
he
knew
that
the
turks
did
not
want
any
foreigner
to
enter
that
land
of
the
arabs
and
that
if
he
were
seen
he
would
certainly
be
ordered
back
yet
he
could
not
hide
for
the
path
ran
close
under
the
castle
and
on
the
wall
strode
the
sentry
the
plain
was
open
there
was
no
way
by
which
he
could
creep
past
at
last
he
came
to
the
hill
on
which
the
castle
stood
at
that
very
moment
a
dense
mist
came
down
he
walked
along
lost
the
track
and
found
it
again
then
there
came
a
challenge
from
the
sentry
he
could
not
see
the
sentry
or
the
sentry
him
so
he
called
back
in
arabic
that
he
was
a
friend
and
so
passed
on
in
the
mist
at
last
he
was
out
on
the
open
ground
beyond
both
the
castle
and
the
little
town
by
it
five
minutes
later
the
mist
blew
away
the
sun
shone
the
castle
was
passed
and
the
open
plains
lay
before
him
the
mist
had
saved
him
in
an
hour
he
came
to
a
large
town
named
orman
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
sandy
plains
and
here
he
stayed
for
some
weeks
his
horses
were
sent
back
to
jerusalem
instead
of
towns
and
villages
of
huts
he
would
now
find
only
the
tents
of
wandering
arabs
who
had
to
keep
moving
to
find
bits
of
sparse
growth
for
their
few
sheep
and
camels
while
he
was
at
orman
he
managed
to
make
friends
with
many
of
the
arabs
and
with
their
chief
he
asked
the
chief
to
help
him
on
toward
kaf
an
oasis
town
across
the
desert
do
go
the
chief
and
his
people
said
the
arabs
there
are
bad
when
we
go
we
never
let
our
rifles
out
of
our
hands
so
the
old
chief
told
him
of
the
dangers
of
the
desert
death
from
thirst
or
from
the
fiery
arabs
of
kaf
i
am
trusting
god
to
protect
and
keep
me
said
forder
i
believe
he
will
do
so
so
forder
handed
the
chief
most
of
his
money
to
take
care
of
and
sewed
up
the
rest
into
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
it
is
as
safe
as
a
bank
to
hand
your
money
to
an
arab
chief
who
has
entertained
you
in
his
tent
if
you
have
eaten
his
salt
he
will
not
betray
or
rob
you
absolute
loyalty
to
your
guest
is
the
unwritten
law
that
no
true
arab
ever
breaks
caravan
of
two
thousand
at
last
the
old
chief
very
unwillingly
called
a
man
told
him
to
get
a
camel
load
up
forder
things
on
it
and
pass
him
on
to
the
first
arab
tent
that
he
found
two
days
passed
before
they
found
a
group
of
bedouin
tents
he
was
allowed
to
sleep
in
a
tent
but
early
in
the
morning
he
woke
with
a
jump
the
whole
of
the
tent
had
fallen
right
on
him
he
crawled
out
he
saw
the
arab
women
standing
round
they
had
pulled
the
tent
down
why
do
you
do
this
so
early
he
asked
the
men
they
replied
have
ordered
us
to
move
to
another
place
they
fear
to
give
shelter
to
a
christian
one
that
is
unclean
and
would
cause
trouble
to
come
on
us
so
the
tribesmen
with
their
women
and
flocks
made
off
leaving
forder
his
guide
and
the
camel
alone
in
the
desert
that
afternoon
he
found
a
tent
and
heard
that
a
great
caravan
was
expected
to
pass
that
night
on
the
way
to
kaf
to
get
salt
night
fell
it
was
a
full
moon
forder
sat
with
the
others
in
the
tent
doorway
round
the
fire
a
man
ran
up
to
them
i
hear
the
bells
of
the
camels
he
said
quickly
forder
goods
were
loaded
on
a
camel
he
jumped
on
top
he
was
led
off
into
the
open
plain
away
across
the
desert
clear
in
the
moonlight
came
the
dark
mass
of
the
caravan
with
the
tinkle
of
innumerable
bells
arabs
galloped
ahead
of
the
caravan
they
drew
up
their
horses
shouting
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
then
came
fifty
horsemen
with
long
spears
in
their
hands
rifles
slung
from
their
shoulders
swords
hanging
from
their
belts
and
revolvers
stuck
in
their
robes
they
were
guarding
the
first
section
made
up
of
four
hundred
camels
there
were
four
sections
each
guarded
by
fifty
warriors
as
they
passed
the
man
with
forder
shouted
out
the
names
of
friends
of
his
who
he
thought
would
be
in
the
caravan
sixteen
hundred
camels
passed
in
the
moonlight
but
still
no
answer
came
then
the
last
section
began
to
pass
the
cry
went
up
again
of
the
names
of
the
men
at
last
an
answering
shout
was
heard
the
men
they
sought
were
found
forder
guide
explained
who
he
was
and
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
kaf
his
baggage
was
swiftly
shifted
onto
another
camel
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
mounted
and
his
camel
was
swinging
along
with
two
thousand
others
into
the
east
for
hour
after
hour
the
tireless
camels
swung
on
and
on
tawny
beasts
on
a
tawny
desert
under
a
silver
moon
that
swam
in
a
deep
indigo
sky
in
which
a
million
stars
sparkled
the
moon
slowly
sank
behind
them
ahead
the
first
flush
of
pink
lighted
the
sky
but
still
they
pushed
on
at
last
at
six
in
the
morning
they
stopped
forder
flung
himself
on
the
sand
wrapped
in
his
his
arab
cloak
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
asleep
in
fifteen

awakened
him

moved
on

in

afternoon
the
camels
moved
on
and
on
unhasting
unresting
as
the
camels
were
kneeling
to
be
unloaded
a
shout
went
up
forder
looking
up
saw
ten
robbers
on
horseback
on
a
mound
like
the
wind
the
caravan
warriors
galloped
after
them
firing
rapidly
and
at
last
captured
them
and
dragged
them
back
to
the
camp
start
again
the
command
went
round
and
in
fifteen
minutes
the
two
thousand
camels
swung
grumbling
and
groaning
out
on
the
endless
trail
of
the
desert
the
captured
arabs
were
marched
in
the
centre
all
through
the
night
the
caravan
went
on
from
moonrise
to
moonset
and
through
the
morning
from
dawn
till
ten
for
they
dared
not
rest
while
the
tribe
from
whom
they
had
captured
the
prisoners
could
get
near
them
then
they
released
the
captives
and
sent
them
back

saw
the
green
palms
of

they
sought

thirty
minutes
in

hours

grunts

dropped
on
their
knees
and
were
freed
from
their
loads
and
began
hungrily
to
eat
their
food
forder
leapt
down
and
was
so
glad
to
be
in
kaf
that
he
ran
into
some
palm
gardens
close
by
and
sang
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
jumped
for
joy
and
then
washed
all
the
sweat
and
sand
from
himself
in
a
hot
spring
of
sulphur
water
lying
down
on
the
floor
of
a
little
house
to

to
the
jowf
said
the
chief
what
do
you
think
of
it
if
i
took
a
christian
to
the
jowf
replied
the
caravan
leader
i
am
afraid
johar
the
chief
there
would
kill
me
for
doing
such
a
thing
i
can
not
do
it
yes
another
said
turning
to
forder
if
you
ever
want
to
see
the
jowf
you
must
turn
moslem
as
no
christian
would
be
allowed
to
live
there
many
days
well
said
the
chief
closing
the
discussion
i
will
see
more
about
this
as
the
men
sat
smoking
round
the
fire
forder
pulled
a
book
out
from
his
pouch
they
watched
him
curiously
can
any
of
you
read
he
asked
there
were
a
number
who
could
so
forder
opened
the
book
which
was
an
arabic
new
testament
at
john
gospel
chapter
iii
will
you
read
he
asked
so
the
arab
read
in
his
own
language
this
chapter
as
we
read
the
chapter
through
ourselves
it
is
interesting
to
wonder
which
of
the
verses
would
be
most
easily
understood
by
the
arabs
when
the
arab
who
was
reading
came
to
the
words
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
forder
talked
to
them
telling
what
the
words
meant
they
listened
very
closely
and
asked
many
questions
it
was
all
quite
new
to
them
will
you
give
me
the
book
asked
the
arab
who
was
reading
forder
knew
that
he
would
only
value
it
if
he
bought
it
so
he
sold
it
to
him
for
some
dates
and
eight
or
nine
men
bought
copies
from
him
next
day
the
chief
tried
to
get
other
passing
arabs
to
conduct
forder
to
the
jowf
but
none
would
take
the
risk
so
at
last
he
lent
him
two
of
his
own
servants
to
lead
him
to
ithera
an
oasis
four
hours
camel
ride
across
the
desert
so
away
they
went
across
the
desert
and
in
the
late
afternoon
saw
the
palms
of
ithera
we
have
brought
you
a
christian
shouted
the
servants
as
they
led
forder
into
a
room
full
of
men
and
dumped
his
goods
down
on
the
floor
we
stick
him
on
to
you
do
what
you
can
with
him
this
is
neither
a
christian
nor
a
jew
nor
an
infidel
shouted
one
of
the
men
but
a
pig
he
did
not
know
that
forder
understood
arabic
men
he
replied
boldly
i
am
neither
pig
infidel
nor
jew
i
am
a
christian
one
that
worships
god
the
same
god
as
you
do
if
you
are
a
christian
exclaimed
the
old
chief
go
and
sit
among
the
cattle
so
forder
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
and
sat
between
an
old
white
mare
and
a
camel
soon
a
man
came
in
and
walking
over
to
forder
put
his
hand
out
and
shook
his
he
sat
down
by
him
and
talking
very
quietly
so
that
the
others
should
not
hear
said
who
are
you
and
from
where
do
you
come
from
jerusalem
said
forder
i
am
a
christian
preacher
if
you
value
your
life
went
on
the
stranger
you
will
get
out
of
this
as
quickly
as
you
can
or
the
men
who
are
a
bad
lot
will
kill
you
i
am
a
druze
but
i
pretend
to
be
a
moslem
what
sort
of
a
man
is
the
chief
of
ithera
asked
forder
very
kind
was
the
reply
so
the
friendly
stranger
went
out
forder
listened
carefully
to
the
talk
let
us
cut
his
throat
while
he
is
asleep
said
one
man
no
said
the
chief
i
will
not
have
the
blood
of
a
christian
on
my
house
and
town
let
us
poison
his
supper
said
another
but
the
chief
would
not
agree
drive
him
out
into
the
desert
to
die
of
hunger
and
thirst
suggested
a
third
no
said
the
chief
whose
name
was
we
will
leave
him
till
the
morning
forder
was
then
called
to
share
supper
with
the
others
and
afterwards
the
chief
led
him
out
to
the
palm
gardens
so
that
his
evil
influence
should
not
make
the
beasts
ill
half
an
hour
later
fearing
he
would
spoil
the
by
his
presence
the
chief
led
him
to
a
filthy
tent
where
an
old
man
lay
with
a
disease
so
horrible
that
they
had
thrust
him
out
of
the
village
to
die
the
next
day
forder
found
that
later
in
the
week
the
old
chief
himself
was
going
to
the
jowf
ripping
open
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
forder
took
out
four
french
napoleons
gold
coins
worth
each
and
went
off
to
the
chief
whom
he
found
alone
in
his
guest
room
walking
up
to
him
forder
held
out
the
money
saying
if
you
will
let
me
go
to
the
jowf
with
you
find
me
camel
water
and
food
i
will
give
you
these
four
pieces

them
to
me

said
and
we
will
start
after
no
replied
forder
you
come
outside
and
before
the
men
of
the
place
i
will
give
them
to
you
they
must
be
witnesses
so
in
the
presence
of
the
men
the
bargain
was
made
in
the
morning
the
camels
were
got
together
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
of
them
with
eighty
men
some
of
whom
came
round
forder
and
patting
their
daggers
and
guns
said
these
things
are
for
using
on
christians
we
shall
leave
your
dead
body
in
the
sand
if
you
do
not
change
your
religion
and
be
a
follower
of
mohammed
after
these
cheerful
encouragements
the
caravan
started
at
one
for
four
hours
they
travelled
then
a
shout
went
up
look
behind
looking
round
forder
saw
a
wild
troop
of
bedouin
robbers
galloping
after
them
as
hard
as
they
could
ride
the
camels
were
rushed
together
in
a
group
the
men
of
ithera
fired
on
the
robbers
and
went
after
them
after
a
short
sharp
battle
the
robbers
made
off
and
the
men
settled
down
where
they
were
for
the
night
during
which
they
had
to
beat
off
another
attack
by
the
robbers
forder
said
what
brave
fellows
you
are
this
praise
pleased
them
immensely
and
they
began
to
be
friendly
with
him
and
forgot
that
they
had
meant
to
leave
his
dead
body
in
the
desert
though
they
still
told
him
he
would
be
killed
at
the
jowf
for
three
days
they
travelled
on
without
finding
any
water
and
even
on
the
fourth
day
they
only
found
it
by
digging
up
the
sand
with
their
fingers
till
they
had
made
a
hole
over
six
feet
deep
where
they
found
some
the
heart
of
the
at
last
forder
saw
the
great
mass
of
the
old
castle
no
one
knows
how
old
that
guards
the
jowf
that
great
isolated
city
with
its
thousands
of
lovely
green
date
palms
in
the
heart
of
the
tremendous
ocean
of
desert
men
women
and
children
came
pouring
out
to
meet
their
friends
for
a
desert
city
is
like
a
port
to
which
the
wilderness
is
the
ocean
and
the
caravan
of
camels
is
the
ship
and
the
friends
go
down
as
men
do
to
the
harbour
to
meet
friends
from
across
the
sea
may
allah
curse
him
they
cried
scowling
when
they
heard
that
a
christian
stranger
was
in
the
caravan
the
enemy
of
allah
and
the
prophet
unclean

johar
the
great
chief

sat
listening
for

and
prayed

silence

a
few
seconds
for

knew
that
on
his
answer

or

depend

yards
when
to
his

amazement
three
men
came
from
behind
him
and
standing
in

and
his
assailants
pulled
out
their
revolvers
and
shouted

christian
the
murderous
crowd
halted
forder
slowly
walked
backwards
toward
his
room
his
defenders
doing
the
same
and
the
crowd
melted
away
he
then
turned
to
his
three
defenders
and
said

come
to
defend
me
as
you
did

been
to
india

answered
and
we
have
seen
the
christians
there
and
we
know
that
they
do
no
harm
to
any
man

have
also
seen
the
effect
of

and
we
will
always
help
christians
when

other
adventures
came
to
forder
in
the
jowf
and
he
read
the
new
testament
with
some
of
the
men
who
bought
the
books
from
him
to
read
at
last
the
chief
of
ithera
who
had
brought
forder
to
the
jowf
said
that
he
must
go
back
and
forder
who
had
now
learned
what
he
wished
about
the
jowf
and
had
put
the
books
of
the
gospel
into
the
hands
of
the
men
decided
to
return
to
his
wife
and
boys
in
jerusalem
to
prepare
to
bring
them
over
to
live
with
him
in
that
land
of
the
arabs
so
he
said
farewell
to
the
chief
johar
and
rode
away
on
a
camel
with
many
things
he
suffered
from
fever
and
hunger
from
heat
and
thirst

vermin

reached
jerusalem
once
more

his
little
boy
clapped

with
joy

he
saw
his
father
come
back
after
those
long
months
of
peril
and
hardship

the
