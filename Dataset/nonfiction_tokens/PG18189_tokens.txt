introduction
growing
nuts
in
the
north
only
a
few
books
have
been
written
on
the
subject
of
nut
trees
and
their
bearing
habits
and
very
little
of
that
material
applies
to
their
propagation
in
cold
climates
for
these
reasons
i
am
relating
some
of
the
experiences
i
have
had
in
the
last
years
in
raising
nut
trees
in
wisconsin
to
me
this
has
been
a
hobby
with
results
both
practical
and
ornamental
far
beyond
my
original
conception
i
hope
that
the
information
i
am
giving
will
be
of
help
and
interest
to
those
who
like
myself
enjoy
having
trees
in
their
dooryards
and
that
it
will
prevent
their
undergoing
the
failures
and
disappointments
i
sometimes
met
with
in
pioneering
along
this
line
since
my
purpose
is
to
give
advice
and
assistance
to
those
whose
interest
parallels
mine
by
relating
my
successes
and
failures
and
what
i
learned
from
each
i
have
included
only
those
details
of
technique
which
are
pertinent
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
hobby
that
takes
one
that
in
itself
suggests
healthful
thought
and
living
the
further
association
of
working
with
trees
as
with
any
living
things
brings
one
into
the
closest
association
with
nature
and
god
i
hope
this
book
may
help
someone
achieve
that
attitude
of
life
in
which
i
have
found
such
great
pleasure
and
inner
satisfaction
anyone
wishing
to
make
a
planting
of
a
few
nut
trees
in
his
dooryard
or
a
small
orchard
planting
should
join
the
northern
nut
association
this
association
can
be
joined
by
writing
the
current
secretary
but
since
that
office
may
be
changed
from
time
to

conclusion
chapter
first
encounters
almost
everyone
can
remember
from
his
youth
trips
made
to
gather
nuts
those
nuts
may
have
been
any
of
the
various
kinds
distributed
throughout
the
united
states
such
as
the
butternut
black
walnut
beechnut
chestnut
hickory
hazel
or
pecan
i
know
that
i
can
recall
very
well
when
i
was
a
child
and
visited
my
grandparents
in
new
ulm
and
peter
in
southern
minnesota
the
abundance
of
butternuts
black
walnuts
and
hazels
to
be
found
along
the
roads
and
especially
along
the
minnesota
and
cottonwood
river
bottoms
since
such
nut
trees
were
not
to
be
found
near
springfield
where
my
parents
lived
which
was
just
a
little
too
far
west
i
still
associate
my
first
and
immature
interest
in
this
kind
of
horticulture
with
those
youthful
trips
east
the
only
way
we
children
could
distinguish
between
butternut
and
black
walnut
trees
was
by
the
fruit
itself
either
on
the
tree
or
shaken
down
this
is
not
surprising
however
since
these
trees
are
closely
related
both
belonging
to
the
family
the
black
walnut
is
known
as
and
the
butternut
or
white
walnut
as
the
similarity
between
the
trees
is
so
pronounced
that
the
most
experienced
horticulturist
may
confuse
them
if
he
has
only
the
trees
in
foliage
as
his
guide
an
experience
i
recently
had
is
quite
suggestive
of
this
i
wished
to
buy
some
furniture
in
either
black
walnut
or
mahogany
and
i
was
hesitating
between
them
noting
my
uncertainty
the
salesman
suggested
a
suite
of
french
walnut
my
curiosity
and
interest
were
immediately
aroused
i
had
not
only
been
raising
many
kinds
of
walnut
trees
but
i
had
also
run
through
my
own
sawmill
logs
of
walnut
and
butternut
i
felt
that
i
knew
the
various
species
of
walnut
very
thoroughly
so
i
suggested
to
him
you
must
mean
circassian
or
english
walnut
which
is
the
same
thing
it
grows
abundantly
in
france
you
are
wrong
in
calling
it
french
walnut
though
because
there
is
no
such
species
he
indignantly
rejected
the
name
i
gave
it
and
insisted
that
it
was
genuine
french
walnut
perhaps
i
advised
him
that
is
a
trade
name
to
cover
the
real
origin
just
as
plucked
muskrat
is
termed
hudson
seal
that
too
he
denied
we
were
both
insistent
i
was
sure
of
my
own
knowledge
and
stubborn
enough
to
want
to
prove
him
wrong
i
pulled
a
drawer
from
the
dresser
of
the
french
walnut
suite
and
asked
him
to
compare
its
weight
with
that
of
a
similar
drawer
from
a
black
walnut
suite
nearby
black
walnut
weighs
forty
pounds
per
cubic
foot
while
butternut
weighs
only
he
was
forced
to
admit
the
difference
and
finally
allowed
my
assertion
to
stand
that
french
walnut
was
butternut
stained
and
finished
to
simulate
black
walnut
since
it
would
have
been
illegal
to
claim
that
it
was
black
walnut
the
attractive
but
meaningless
label
of
french
walnut
had
been
applied
although
it
is
less
expensive
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
butternut
is
not
an
excellent
wood
for
constructing
furniture
it
ranks
high
in
quality
and
is
probably
as
durable
as
black
walnut
i
do
say
though
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
know
both
the
species
names
and
the
relative
weights
of
each
wood
to
be
able
to
distinguish
between
them
indisputably
an
instance
in
which
the
nuts
themselves
were
useless
for
purposes
of
identification
occurred
when
i
sent
some
black
walnuts
to
the
division
of
pomology
at
washington
these
were
the
ohio
variety
which
i
had
grafted
on
butternut
roots
the
tree
had
been
bearing
for
three
or
four
years
but
this
was
the
first
year
the
nuts
had
matured
during
their
bearing
period
these
black
walnuts
had
gradually
changed
in
appearance
becoming
elongated
and
very
deeply
and
sharply
corrugated
like
butternuts
although
they
still
retained
the
black
walnut
flavor
because
of
this
mixture
of
characteristics
the
government
experts
had
great
difficulty
in
identifying
the
variety
although
the
ohio
was
well
known
to
them
another
variety
of
black
walnut
the
thomas
i
have
also
known
to
be
influenced
by
the
butternut
stock
on
which
it
was
grafted
when
in
one
of
my
trees
bore
black
walnuts
whose
meat
had
lost
its
characteristic
flavor
and
assumed
that
of
the
butternut
illustration
genuine
original
ohio
black
walnut
from
parent
nut
produced
by
grafting
ohio
on
i
also
liked
to
pick
hazelnuts
when
i
was
a
boy
these
are
probably
the
least
interesting
among
the
wild
nuts
since
they
are
usually
small
and
hard
to
crack
there
is
much
variation
in
wild
hazels
however
and
many
people
may
recall
them
as
being
reasonably
large
one
of
the
two
species
abundant
in
minnesota
or
beak
hazel
has
fine
hairs
on
its
husk
which
are
sure
to
stick
into
one
fingers
disagreeably
when
the
husk
is
removed
resembles
a
small
acorn
it
does
not
produce
in
southern
minnesota
and
central
wisconsin
as
well
as
the
common
hazel
does
nor
is
its
flavor
as
pleasing
to
most
people
it
is
lighter
in
color
than
the
common
hazel
and
has
a
thinner
shell
of
course
some
hazels
are
intermediate
or
natural
hybrids
between
these
two
species
and
if
the
nuts
of
such
hybrids
are
planted
they
generally
revert
to
one
of
the
parents
when
mature
enough
to
bear
this
natural
hybridization
occurs
among
all
plants
between
those
of
the
same
species
the
same
genera
or
the
same
family
it
is
very
rare
between
plants
of
different
families
the
process
is
a
very
important
one
in
horticulture
and
i
shall
explain
some
of
the
crosses
which
are
later
in
this
book
chapter
first
attempts
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
old
my
family
moved
to
paul
minnesota
where
my
home
now
is
and
where
my
experimental
work
with
nuts
was
begun
paul
is
in
the
north
parallel
but
although
it
is
farther
north
it
is
as
favorable
for
the
growth
of
nut
trees
as
new
ulm
or
peter
because
it
lies
in
the
mississippi
river
valley
and
is
farther
east
bodies
of
water
and
altitudes
have
as
great
an
influence
on
plant
life
as
latitude
at
least
they
can
have
and
these
are
factors
that
must
be
understood
thoroughly
soil
conditions
also
vitally
affect
plant
life
particularly
trees
such
as
nut
trees
usually
are
each
has
its
own
requirements
hickory
japanese
heartnut
and
persian
walnuts
favor
an
alkaline
soil
which
chestnuts
wanting
acid
will
not
grow
in
chestnuts
thrive
best
in
a
slightly
acid
soil
hazels
will
grow
in
either
alkaline
or
acid
soil
as
will
black
walnuts
and
butternuts
almonds
need
a
light
sandy
soil
similar
to
that
suitable
to
plums
pecans
do
well
in
either
rich
river
bottoms
which
may
be
slightly
acid
or
in
clay
soil
on
high
hillsides
which
are
alkaline
a
deep
sandy
or
graveltype
soil
is
usually
accepted
by
the
chestnuts
even
though
it
may
not
be
slightly
acid
and
successful
orchards
have
been
grown
on
a
deep
clay
soil
on
hillsides
it
is
not
always
easy
to
obtain
black
walnuts
and
butternuts
to
eat
hickory
nuts
have
been
a
favorite
of
mine
since
i
first
tasted
them
and
i
often
have
found
it
difficult
to
procure
fresh
ones
ones
that
were
not
slightly
rancid
because
i
liked
eating
these
nuts
i
thought
i
would
try
to
grow
some
for
my
own
consumption
and
so
avoid
having
to
depend
on
a
grocer
occasional
supply
of
those
shipped
in
always
a
little
stale
raising
nuts
appealed
to
me
economically
too
since
obviously
trees
would
need
little
care
and
after
they
had
begun
to
bear
would
supply
nuts
that
could
be
sold
at
interesting
prices
i
turned
the
back
yard
of
my
home
in
paul
into
an
experimental
plot
here
i
set
out
some
of
each
kind
of
tree
i
planted
or
grafted
at
my
farm
in
wisconsin
i
had
purchased
a
farm
miles
east
of
paul
beyond
the
influence
of
the
croix
river
valley
my
experiments
really
began
there
the
farm
was
covered
with
butternut
trees
hazel
bushes
and
a
wild
hickory
called
bitternut
this
last
is
for
i
have
never
found
an
animal
other
than
a
squirrel
that
could
endure
its
nuts
possibly
the
mouse
or
could
i
do
know
he
usually
eats
anything
a
squirrel
does
i
learned
to
appreciate
these
bitternut
trees
later
and
they
became
a
source
of
experience
and
interest
to
me
as
i
learned
to
graft
on
them
many
varieties
species
and
hybrids
of
hickory
they
served
as
a
and
shortened
the
length
of
time
required
to
test
dozens
of
hickory
types
helping
me
in
that
way
to
learn
within
one
lifetime
what
types
of
nuts
are
practical
for
growing
in
the
north
remembering
the
nut
trees
in
southern
minnesota
i
first
thought
to
procure
black
walnut
and
hickory
trees
from
some
farmer
in
that
district
through
acquaintances
in
peter
i
did
locate
some
black
walnut
trees
only
to
find
that
it
was
impractical
to
dig
and
transport
trees
of
the
size
i
wanted
a
nursery
near
paul
supplied
me
with
some
and
i
bought
large
seedling
black
walnut
trees
i
was
too
eager
to
get
ahead
with
my
plans
and
i
attempted
the
first
year
these
trees
were
planted
to
graft
all
of
them
my
ability
to
do
this
was
not
equal
to
my
ambition
though
and
all
but
two
of
the
trees
were
killed
i
was
successful
in
grafting
one
of
them
to
a
stabler
black
walnut
the
other
tree
persisted
so
in
throwing
out
its
natural
sprouts
that
i
decided
it
should
be
allowed
to
continue
doing
so
that
native
seedling
tree
which
i
could
not
graft
now
furnishes
me
with
bushels
of
walnuts
each
year
which
are
planted
for
understocks
this
is
the
name
given
to
the
root
systems
on
which
good
varieties
are
grafted
in
an
effort
to
replace
these
lost
trees
i
inquired
at
the
university
of
minnesota
farm
and
was
given
the
addresses
of
several
nurserymen
who
were
then
selling
grafted
nut
trees
their
catalogues
were
so
inviting
that
i
decided
it
would
be
quite
plausible
to
grow
pecans
and
english
walnuts
at
this
latitude
so
i
neglected
my
native
trees
that
year
for
the
sake
of
more
exotic
ones
one
year
sufficed
the
death
of
my
whole
planting
of
english
walnuts
and
pecans
turned
me
back
to
my
original
interest
my
next
order
of
trees
included
grafted
black
walnuts
of
four
accepted
varieties
to
be
planted
in
orchard
form
the
stabler
thomas
ohio
and
ten
eyck
i
ordered
a
few
hickories
at
the
same
time
but
these
eventually
died
my
experience
with
hickories
was
very
discouraging
since
they
were
my
favorite
nuts
and
i
had
set
my
heart
on
growing
some
i
think
i
should
have
given
up
attempting
them
had
not
one
dealer
jones
urged
that
i
buy
just
three
more
hickory
trees
of
the
beaver
variety
he
gave
me
special
instructions
on
how
to
prepare
them
against
winter
i
have
always
felt
that
what
he
told
me
was
indeed
special
and
very
valuable
since
those
three
trees
lived
subsequently
i
bought
several
hundred
dollars
worth
of
trees
from
him
more
than
that
we
became
friends
i
visited
him
at
his
nurseries
in
lancaster
pennsylvania
and
he
again
demonstrated
his
interest
and
generosity
by
giving
me
both
horticultural
information
and
the
kindest
hospitality
my
friendship
with
him
was
but
one
of
many
that
i
have
formed
while
traveling
and
corresponding
in
the
interests
of
nut
culture
true
and
lasting
friends
such
men
make
too
with
no
circumstances
of
selfish
import
to
taint
the
pleasure
of
the
relationship
since
i
wanted
to
have
many
black
walnut
trees
some
day
i
decided
to
plant
ten
bushels
of
black
walnuts
in
rows
i
thought
i
could
later
graft
these
myself
and
save
expense
the
theory
was
all
right
but
when
i
came
to
practice
it
i
found
i
had
not
taken
squirrels
into
consideration
these
rats
dug
up
one
complete
bed
which
contained
two
bushels
of
nuts
and
reburied
them
in
haphazard
places
around
the
farm
when
the
nuts
started
to
sprout
they
came
up
in
the
fields
in
the
gardens
and
on
the
lawn
everywhere
except
where
i
had
intended
them
to
be
i
later
was
grateful
to
those
squirrels
though
because
through
their
redistributing
these
nuts
i
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
effect
of
soil
on
black
walnut
trees
even
discovering
that
what
i
thought
to
be
suitable
was
not
the
trees
which
the
squirrels
planted
for
me
are
now
large
and
lend
themselves
to
experimental
grafting
on
them
i
have
proved
and
am
still
proving
new
varieties
of
the
english
walnut
the
other
eight
bushels
had
been
planted
near
a
roadside
and
close
to
some
farm
buildings
the
constant
human
activity
thereabouts
probably
made
the
squirrels
less
bold
for
although
they
carried
off
at
least
a
bushel
of
walnuts
about
two
thousand
seedlings
grew
i
had
planted
these
too
close
together
and
as
the
trees
developed
they
became
so
crowded
that
many
died
the
remaining
seedlings
supplied
me
with
for
experimental
work
which
proved
very
valuable
i
have
always
suspected
the
squirrels
of
having
been
responsible
for
the
fact
that
my
first
attempt
to
grow
hickory
seedlings
was
unsuccessful
i
planted
a
quart
of
these
nuts
and
not
one
plant
came
up
no
doubt
the
squirrels
dug
them
up
as
soon
as
i
planted
them
and
probably
they
enjoyed
the
flavor
as
much
as
i
always
have
in
i
ordered
one
hundred
small
beechnut
trees
from
the
sturgeon
bay
nurseries
at
sturgeon
bay
wisconsin
the
company
was
very
generous
and
sent
me
three
hundred
of
them
i
planted
these
trees
in
a
heavy
clay
soil
with
limestone
running
near
the
surface
they
grew
well
the
first
year
except
that
there
was
heavy
mortality
during
cold
weather
in
working
with
these
trees
my
lack
of
experience
and
horticultural
knowledge
was
against
me
they
could
not
tolerate
the
soil
and
within
three
years
they
were
all
dead
to
give
variety
to
the
landscape
at
my
farm
i
planted
several
other
kinds
of
trees
among
these
were
kentucky
which
have
beautiful
bronze
foliage
in
the
spring
and
honey
locusts
i
planted
five
hundred
douglas
fir
but
unfortunately
i
put
these
deep
in
the
woods
among
heavy
timber
where
they
were
so
shaded
that
only
a
few
lived
later
i
moved
the
surviving
fir
trees
into
an
open
field
where
they
still
flourish
about
two
hundred
fifty
pines
of
mixed
varieties
white
norway
and
jack
that
i
planted
in
the
woods
also
died
i
decided
then
that
evergreens
might
do
better
if
they
were
planted
from
seeds
i
followed
instructions
in
james
toumey
seeding
and
planting
in
the
practice
of
forestry
in
bed
culture
and
spot
seeding
in
the
latter
one
tears
off
the
sod
in
favorable
places
and
throws
seed
on
the
unprotected
ground
in
doing
this
i
ignored
the
natural
requirements
of
forest
practice
which
call
for
during
the
first
two
to
three
years
of
growth
thousands
of
seedlings
sprouted
but
they
all
died
either
from
disease
or
from
attacks
by
cows
and
sheep
one
should
never
attempt
to
raise
trees
and
stock
in
the
same
field
because
of
these
misfortunes
i
determined
to
study
the
growth
of
evergreens
i
invested
in
such
necessary
equipment
as
frames
and
lath
screening
better
equipped
with
both
information
and
material
i
grew
thousands
of
evergreen

among
the

many
of
the
limber
pines
came
into
bearing
about
fifteen
years
after
the
seed
was
planted
at
that
age
they
varied
in
height
from
three
to
fifteen
feet
one
little
tree
had
several
large
cones
full
of
seed
each
tree
varied
in
the
quality
and
size
of
its
seeds
although
it
might
be
possible
to
graft
the
best
varieties
on
young
seedling
stocks
in
all
the
hundreds
of
grafts
i
have
made
on
pine
i
have
been
successful
only
once
i
doubt
that
such
a
thing
would
ever
be
practical
from
a
commercial
standpoint
unless
some
new
method
were
discovered
by
which
a
larger
percentage
of
successful
grafts
could
be
realized
i
cultivated
the
douglas
fir
white
norway
and
colorado
blue
varieties
of
spruce
besides
these
i
planted
balsam
fir
red
cedar
and
white
cedar
practically
all
of
these
trees
are
still
growing
and
many
of
them
bear
seed
i
wish
to
describe
the
limber
pine
for
it
is
not
only
a
good
grower
and
quite
hardy
but
it
is
also
a
very
ornamental
nut
pine
which
grows
to
be
a
broad
tree
to
feet
high
the
young
bark
is
pale
grey
or
silver
the
old
bark
is
very
dark
in
square
plates
the
wood
itself
is
light
soft
and
having
a
color
that
varies
from
yellow
to
red
the
needles
which
are
found
in
clusters
of
five
are
slender
to
inches
long
and
are
dark
green
they
are
shed
during
the
fifth
or
sixth
year
the
buds
of
the
tree
are
found
bunched
at
the
branch
tips
and
are
scaly
and
pointed
the
limber
pine
has
flowers
like
those
of
the
white
pine
except
that
they
are
although
the
fruit
is
described
as
annual
i
have
found
that
in
this
locality
it
takes
about
fifteen
months
from
the
time
the
blossoms
appear
for
it
to
reach
maturity
that
is
the
fruit
requires
two
seasons
for
growth
maturing
its
seeds
the
second
september
the
cones
of
the
limber
pine
which
vary
from
three
to
seven
inches
in
length
are
purple
having
thick
rounded
scales
and
being
abruptly
peaked
at
the
apex
the
seeds
are
wingless
or
have
only
very
narrow
wings
around
them
with
the
idea
of
getting
practical
results
sooner
since
nut
trees
mature
slowly
i
interplanted
my
nut
trees
with
varieties
of
apple
plum
and
cherry
doing
so
also
served
to
economize
on
ground
since
ultimately
nut
trees
require
a
great
deal
of
space
for
best
growth
walnut
trees
for
example
should
be
set
to
feet
apart
in
each
direction
illustration
flexilus
nut
seeds
natural
i
learned
a
variety
of
facts
during
these
first
years
of
trial
and
error
i
discovered
for
instance
that
iron
fence
posts
rust
away
in
an
acid
soil
that
one
must
use
cedar
or
oak
conversely
in
alkaline
soil
iron
will
last
indefinitely
but
that
the
nitrogenous
bacteria
will
quickly
rot
wooden
posts
i
found
that
the
secret
of
growing
hickories
successfully
lies
in
giving
them
plenty
of
room
with
no
forest
trees
around
to
cut
off
their
supply
of
sunlight
and
air
i
learned
that
it
is
impractical
to
graft
a
large
forest
tree
of
butternut
or
hickory
incidental
to
that
i
learned
that
a
branch
of
a
butternut
tree
which
looks
large
enough
to
support
a
man
weight
near
the
trunk
will
not
do
so
when
the
branch
is
green
and
alive
but
that
a
dead
branch
of
similar
size
will
contrariwise
even
a
small
green
limb
of
a
will
bear
my
weight
but
an
old
limb
though
several
inches
thick
becomes
so
brittle
after
it
is
dead
for
several
years
that
it
will
break
under
slight
pressure
fortunately
falls
from
trees
do
not
usually
result
in
serious
injuries
but
i
did
acquire
quite
a
few
bruises
learning
these
distinctions
there
is
always
a
natural
mortality
in
planting
trees
but
in
those
first
years
lacking
experience
i
lost
more
than
nearly
all
of
them
started
to
grow
but
died
during
the
first
few
winters
those
which
survived
were
the
start
of
a
nursery
filled
with
hardy
trees
which
can
endure
the
climate
of
the
north
in
looking
back
i
appreciate
how
fortunate
i
was
in
having
sought
and
received
advice
from
experienced
nurserymen
had
i
not
done
so
frequent
failures
would
surely
have
discouraged
me
as
it
was
the
successes
i
did
have
were
an
incentive
which
made
me
persist
and
which
left
me
with
faith
enough
in
an
ultimate
success
to
go
on
buying
seeds
and
trees
and
to
make
greater
and
more
varied
experiments
chapter
black
walnuts
i
have
spent
more
of
my
time
cultivating
black
walnuts
than
any
other
kind
of
nut
tree
and
given
more
of
my
ground
area
over
to
them
yet
it
was
with
no
great
amount
of
enthusiasm
that
i
started
working
with
these
trees
obviously
there
could
be
nothing
new
or
extraordinary
resulting
from
my
planting
trees
of
this
species
either
on
my
farm
or
at
my
paul
home
since
there
already
were
mature
bearing
black
walnut
trees
at
both
places
it
was
only
with
the
idea
that
they
would
be
an
attractive
addition
to
the
native
butternut
groves
that
i
decided
to
plant
some
black
walnut
seedlings
this
did
not
prove
feasible
as
i
first
attempted
it
i
had
engaged
a
miller
at
peter
to
procure
wild
black
walnut
trees
for
me
since
they
grew
near
that
town
he
was
to
dig
these
trees
with
as
much
of
the
root
system
included
as
possible
and
ship
them
to
my
farm
but
the
winter
season
came
before
this
had
been
accomplished
and
both
miller
and
i
deciding
the
idea
was
not
as
practical
as
we
had
hoped
it
would
be
abandoned
it
later
that
same
autumn
i
found
that
a
nursery
just
outside
of
paul
had
several
rows
of
overgrown
black
walnut
trees
which
they
would
sell
me
quite
reasonably
i
bought
them
and
sent
instructions
to
the
tenant
at
my
farm
to
dig
large
holes
in
which
to
plant
them
packed
in
straw
and
burlap
the
trees
weighed
about
pounds
i
found
this
was
much
too
heavy
and
cumbersome
to
pack
in
my
old
touring
car
so
i
hunted
around
for
some
sort
of
vehicle
i
could
attach
to
my
car
as
a
trailer
in
an
old
blacksmith
shop
i
came
upon
an
antiquated
pair
of
buggy
wheels
they
looked
as
though
they
were
ready
to
fall
apart
but
i
decided
that
with
repairs
and
by
cautious
driving
they
might
last
out
the
trip
of
miles
so
i
paid
the
blacksmith
his
asking
price
cents
the
spokes
rattled
and
the
steel
tires
were
ready
to
roll
off
their
wooden
rims
but
the
axles
were
strong
my
and
i
puttered
and
pounded
strengthened
and
tightened
until
we
felt
our
was
in
order
it
might
have
been
too
if
the
roads
in
the
country
had
been
rough
and
frozen
so
hard
that
they
hammered
on
the
solid
unresisting
tires
and
spokes
until
almost
within
sight
of
the
farm
one
wheel
dismally
collapsed
as
the
wheel
broke
the
trailer
slid
off
the
road
into
a
ditch
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
send
on
to
the
farm
for
the
plow
horses
to
haul
out
the
car
the
trailer
and
the
trees
the
horses
finished
hauling
the
trees
to
that
part
of
the
farm
where
holes
had
been
dug
for
them
i
had
told
my
tenant
to
dig
large
holes
and
large
holes
he
had
certainly
dug
most
of
them
were
big
enough
to
bury
one
of
the
horses
in
such
was
my
amateurish
first
endeavor
it
was
not
until
december
of
that
year
that
the
trees
were
finally
planted
although
the
ground
was
already
somewhat
frozen
and
the
trees
poorly
planted
as
a
result
most
of
them
started
to
grow
in
the
spring
they
would
probably
be
living
now
if
i
had
not
been
too
ambitious
to
convert
them
from
seedlings
into
grafted
varieties
such
as
the
ohio
thomas
and
stabler
which
i
had
learned
of
during
a
winter
study
of
available
lore
i
obtained
scionwood
from
jones
part
of
which
i
put
on
these
abused
trees
and
the
remainder
of
which
i
grafted
on
butternut
trees
at
that
time
i
must
admit
i
was
much
more
interested
in
trying
the
actual
work
of
grafting
than
i
was
in
developing
or
even
conceiving
a
methodical
plan
to
be
worked
out
over
a
period
of
years
in
order
to
facilitate
my
grafting
work
that
spring
i
pitched
a
tent
in
the
woods
and
lived
there
for
a
week
at
a
time
doing
my
own
cooking
and
roughing
it
generally
cows
were
being
pastured
in
this
part
of
the
woods
and
they
were
very
interested
in
my
activities
if
i
were
absent
for
a
long
time
during
the
day
on
my
return
i
would
find
that
noticeable
damage
had
been
done
to
my
tent
and
food
supplies
by
these
curious
cows
while
preparing
some
scionwood
inside
the
tent
one
day
i
heard
a
cow
approaching
and
picked
up
a
heavy
hickory
club
which
i
had
for
protection
at
night
intending
to
rush
out
and
give
the
animal
a
proper
lesson
in
minding
its
own
business
the
cow
approached
the
tent
from
the
side
opposite
the
door
and
pushed
solidly
against
the
canvas
with
its
nose
and
head
this
so
aggravated
me
that
i
jumped
over
to
that
part
of
the
tent
and
gave
the
cow
a
hard
whack
over
the
nose
with
my
hickory
stick
it
jumped
away
fast
for
such
a
big
animal
this
seemed
to
end
all
curiosity
on
the
part
of
these
cows
and
i
was
allowed
to
carry
on
my
work
in
peace
with
beginner
luck
i
succeeded
with
many
of
the
butternut
grafts
as
well
as
with
some
of
the
grafts
on
the
planted
black
walnuts
however
all
of
the
grafted
black
walnut
trees
ultimately
died
with
the
exception
of
one
grafted
stabler
this
large
tree
was
a
monument
of
success
for
twenty
years
bearing
some
nuts
every
year
and
maturing
them
and
in
a
good
season
producing
bushels
of
them
one
other
of
these
seedlings
survived
but
as
it
would
not
accept
any
grafts
i
finally
let
it
live
as
nature
intended
in
i
began
ordering
grafted
black
walnut
trees
as
well
as
grafted
hickory
trees
from
jones
who
had
the
largest
and
best
known
of
the
nurseries
handling
northern
nut
trees
some
of
these
grafted
trees
were
also
planted
at
my
home
in
paul
using
the
two
locations
as
checks
against
each
other
the
site
in
paul
eventually
proved
unsatisfactory
because
of
the
gravelly
soil
and
because
the
trees
were
too
crowded
the
varieties
of
black
walnuts
i
first
experimented
with
were
the
thomas
ohio
stabler
and
ten
eyck
which
were
planted
by
hundreds
year
after
year
if
i
had
not
worked
on
this
large
scale
there
would
be
no
reason
for
me
to
write
about
it
today
as
the
mortality
of
these
black
walnuts
was
so
high
that
probably
none
would
have
lived
to
induce
in
me
the
ambition
necessary
to
support
a
plan
involving
lengthy
systematic
experimentation
some
of
these
early
trees
survive
today
however
and
although
few
in
number
they
have
shown
me
that
the
experiment
was
a
worthy
one
since
it
laid
the
foundation
for
results
which
came
later
in
fact
i
feel
that
both
the
time
and
money
i
spent
during
that
initial
era
of
learning
were
investments
in
which
valuable
dividends
of
knowledge
and
development
are
still
being
paid
in
grafting
black
walnuts
on
butternut
trees
i
very
foolishly
attempted
to
work
over
a
tree
more
than
a
foot
in
diameter
and
i
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
single
graft
to
grow
on
it
other
younger
trees
from
three
to
six
inches
in
diameter
i
successfully
grafted
some
of
these
are
still
living
but
clearly
show
the
incompatibility
of
the
two
species
when
black
walnut
is
grafted
on
butternut
the
opposite
combination
of
butternut
on
black
walnut
is
very
successful
and
produces
nuts
earlier
and
in
greater
abundance
than
butternut
does
when
grafted
on
its
own
species
the
expense
of
buying
trees
by
hundreds
was
so
great
that
after
a
year
i
decided
that
i
could
very
easily
plant
black
walnuts
to
obtain
the
young
trees
needed
as
understocks
when
they
had
grown
large
enough
i
would
graft
them
over
myself
i
wrote
to
my
friend
in
peter
miller
and
he
told
me
where
i
could
obtain
walnuts
by
the
bushel
soon
i
was
making
trips
to
the
countryside
around
peter
buying
walnuts
from
the
farmers
there
i
planted
about
five
bushels
of
these
at
the
river
falls
farm
and
the
rest
another
two
bushels
at
paul
soon
i
had
several
thousand
young
walnut
trees
which
all
proved
hardy
to
the
winters
when
pruning
the
black
walnut
trees
purchased
from
jones
for
transplanting
i
saved
the
tops
and
grafted
them
to
the
young
trees
with
a
fair
degree
of
success
in
a
few
years
i
was
using
my
own
trees
to
fill
up
spaces
left
vacant
by
the
mortality
of
the
trees
i
did
not
neglect
seeding
to
provide
stocks
of
the
eastern
black
walnut
also
which
is
almost
a
different
species
from
the
local
black
walnut
but
these
seedling
trees
proved
to
be
tender
toward
our
winters
and
only
a
few
survived
after
they
had
grown
into
large
trees
these
few
were
grafted
to
english
walnuts
the
difference
between
the
eastern
black
walnut
and
the
local
native
black
walnut
is
quite
apparent
when
the
two
trees
are
examined
side
by
side
even
the
type
of
fruit
is
different
although
i
do
not
know
of
any
botanical
authority
who
will
confirm
my
theory
that
they
are
different
species
they
are
probably
to
be
considered
as
geographically
distinct
rather
than
as
botanically
different
species
for
several
years
i
continued
to
graft
black
walnuts
on
butternut
trees
with
the
intention
of
converting
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
these
wild
trees
over
to
prolific
cultured
black
walnuts
i
did
not
realize
my
mistake
in
doing
this
until
ten
years
had
elapsed
i
believed
that
since
the
tops
were
growing
the
trees
would
shortly
produce
nuts
today
they
are
still
growing
bigger
and
better
yet
most
of
these
grafted
trees
bear
no
nuts
having
only
a
crop
of
leaves
a
few
nuts
result
from
these
grafts
however
and
some
of
the
trees
bear
a
handful
of
nuts
from
tops
of
such
size
that
one
would
expect
the
crops
to
be
measured
in
bushels
the
kind
which
bore
the
best
was
the
ohio
variety
in
another
chapter
i
shall
relate
parallel
experience
in
hickory
grafting
which
i
carried
on
simultaneously
with
grafting
of
black
walnut
on
butternut
my
first
big
disappointment
in
my
black
walnut
orchard
was
when
in
about
having
a
fairly
good
crop
of
nuts
i
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
sell
them
to
local
stores
they
were
not
interested
in
anything
except
walnut
kernels
and
to
them
a
wild
walnut
kernel
was
the
same
as
a
cultivated
one
as
long
as
it
was
this
so
cooled
my
enthusiasm
and
hopes
for
a
black
walnut
orchard
that
i
ceased
experimenting
with
them
except
to
try
out
new
varieties
being
discovered
through
nut
contests
carried
on
by
the
northern
nut
association
the
contest
produced
a
number
of
black
walnut
possibilities
among
them
being
such
named
varieties
as
the
rohwer
paterson
throp
vandersloot
pearl
and
adams
the
neglected
and
walnut
seedlings
now
began
to
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
grafting
the
new
varieties
which
i
obtained
for
testing
in
this
locality
these
were
propagated
by
obtaining
scionwood
from
the
originators
of
the
variety
and
grafting
it
on
these
seedling
trees
my
technical
knowledge
had
increased
by
this
time
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
usually
certain
of
of
the
grafts
growing
the
behavior
of
the
rohwer
and
paterson
in
invited
nursery
propagation
on
a
greater
scale
than
did
other
types
because
of
their
qualities
of
hardiness
and
in
the
spring
of
these
native
seedlings
were
again
offered
to
the
spirit
of
propagation
when
a
large
part
of
the
scionwood
of
english
walnuts
i
had
imported
from
the
carpathian
mountains
of
poland
was
grafted
on
them
the
success
of
my
grafting
in
this
instance
was
only
about
showing
that
something
was
decidedly
wrong
two
conclusions
were
possible
either
the
scionwood
had
been
injured
by
transportation
and
the
severe
winter
temperatures
during
january
and
february
of
during
which
they
were
stored
or
incompatibility
existed
between
the
imported
walnuts
and
our
local
ones
my
conclusion
now
is
that
when
these
stocks
are
fifteen
years
old
or
more
and
are
thrifty
they
will
support
grafting
of
the
carpathian
english
walnuts
much
more
successfully
than
they
will
in
their
first
decade
of
growth
results
have
shown
that
these
local
stocks
will
accept
such
grafts
however
and
that
crops
of
english
walnuts
will
be
produced
the
fertility
of
the
soil
must
be
maintained
carefully
since
the
english
walnut
top
tends
to
overgrow
its
black
walnut
and
unless
nutritional
substance
for
the
support
of
these
tops
is
fed
to
the
meager
crops
if
any
will
result
i
might
note
in
comparison
to
the
success
i
had
in
this
grafting
that
during
the
same
season
i
put
several
hundred
scions
of
these
same
english
walnuts
on
the
eastern
black
walnut
stocks
without
a
single
successful
graft
occurring
in
and
many
of
these
experimentally
grafted
walnuts
such
as
vandersloot
paterson
and
rohwer
as
well
as
others
were
planted
in
orchard
formation
in
digging
these
trees
we
took
care
to
get
all
of
the
root
possible
and
to
take
a
ball
of
dirt
with
the
root
in
spite
of
these
precautions
some
of
the
trees
died
not
having
sufficient
vitality
and
root
development
to
withstand
transplantation
this
was
a
result
not
only
of
the
crowded
condition
under
which
the
stocks
had
grown
but
also
of
the
poor
soil
which
had
nourished
them
the
soil
was
heavy
blue
clay
underlaid
with
limestone
within
two
feet
of
the
top
of
the
ground
enough
trees
were
set
out
in
orchard
formation
which
are
growing
well
and
bearing
annual
crops
to
give
us
the
proof
we
need
in
drawing
conclusions
of
superiority
among
these
varieties
black
walnuts
will
keep
for
several
years
if
they
are
properly
dried
and
then
stored
in
a
cool
but
not
too
damp
place
storing
nuts
in
attics
which
are
likely
to
become
excessively
hot
in
the
summer
time
causes
rancidity
sooner
than
any
other
method
nuts
keep
very
well
in
attics
during
the
winter
but
they
should
be
transferred
to
a
basement
during
hot
weather
if
the
basement
is
very
damp
though
nuts
will
mould
there
for
general
storage
without
having
to
move
them
from
one
place
to
another
for
different
seasons
nuts
can
be
kept
most
practically
in
a
barn
or
outside
shed
the
only
precaution
necessary
under
such
circumstances
is
that
they
should
be
in
a
box
or
steel
barrel
to
prevent
squirrels
and
mice
from
feeding
on
them
since
barns
and
sheds
are
easily
accessible
to
these
animals
the
kernels
of
black
walnuts
need
not
be
discolored
if
the
hulls
of
the
fresh
nuts
are
removed
as
soon
as
the
nuts
are
ripe
at
my
farm
we
have
done
this
with
an
ordinary
the
nuts
having
been
hulled
this
way
are
then
soaked
in
water
for
a
few
hours
to
remove
any
excess
coloring
matter
left
on
their
shells
after
which
they
are
dried
for
several
days
although
not
exposed
to
the
sun
since
this
might
cause
them
to
crack
open
thorough
drying
is
necessary
before
sacking
to
prevent
moulding
kernels
extracted
from
nuts
treated
this
way
are
very
light
in
color
like
english
walnuts
this
enhances
their
market
value
and
they
command
a
higher
price
when
they
are
to
be
used
for
culinary
purposes
such
as
cake
frosting
and
candies
where
there
is
exposure
of
large
pieces
or
halves
of
the
nut
kernel
i
find
black
walnuts
are
exceptionally
delicious
when
used
in
a
candy
called
divinity
fudge
the
strong
flavor
of
the
black
walnut
kernel
although
appreciated
by
many
people
is
not
as
popular
as
that
of
the
butternut
of
which
more
is
said
in
another
chapter
the
food
value
of
black
walnut
kernels
is
high
since
they
are
composed
of
concentrated
fat
and
protein
similar
to
the
english
walnut
the
hickory
nut
and
the
pecan
there
is
also
the
advantage
which
john
harvey
kellogg
of
battle
creek
michigan
has
pointed
out
that
nuts
are
a
food
of
high
purity
being
entirely
free
from
disease
bacteria
one
could
safely
say
of
unshelled
nuts
that
there
is
not
a
disease
germ
in
a
carload
there
was
a
time
when
black
walnut
hulls
were
purchased
by
producers
of
insecticides
the
black
walnut
hull
when
dried
and
pulverized
produces
a
substance
which
gives
body
to
the
concentrated
pyrethrum
extract
which
is
the
essential
ingredient
of
many
insecticides
one
can
not
leave
a
discussion
of
black
walnuts
without
reflecting
on
the
furniture
which
has
been
possible
only
through
the
use
of
vast
forests
of
black
walnut
timber
beautiful
veneers
have
come
from
the
burl
walnut
being
formed
by
protuberances
on
the
trunks
of
the
trees
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
there
is
a
variety
of
black
walnut
which
we
have
been
experimenting
with
for
quite
a
few
years
called
the
lamb
which
has
a
beautifully
figured
grain
as
this
appears
only
in
mature
timber
ours
is
not
yet
old
enough
to
show
it
i
have
found
that
the
ohio
black
walnut
is
prone
to
hybridize
with
butternut
trees
in
its
vicinity
and
others
have
told
me
of
its
hybridizing
with
english
walnut
trees
near
it
which
shows
it
to
be
almost
as
vacillating
in
character
as
our
japanese
walnuts
or
heartnuts
ohio
black
walnuts
when
planted
usually
produce
vigorous
stocks
many
of
which
show
hybridity
of
some
sort
if
one
examines
the
nuts
of
the
ohio
and
finds
them
dwarfed
or
deformed
he
may
be
sure
that
they
have
been
pollinized
by
something
other
than
a
black
walnut
planting
such
nuts
then
will
grow
hybrid
trees
most
of
us
have
enough
curiosity
to
want
to
try
this
as
an
experiment
thomas
walnut
seedlings
have
produced
more
thrifty
trees
than
ohio
nuts
have
however
the
best
understocks
are
those
produced
from
seeds
of
native
grown
trees
it
is
well
understood
that
rarely
does
a
specific
type
such
as
the
ohio
thomas
or
stabler
reproduce
itself
exactly
from
seeds
in
raising
black
walnut
seedlings
my
experience
has
taught
me
that
the
nuts
should
be
planted
in
the
fall
and
not
too
deep
one
to
two
inches
below
the
surface
being
all
the
depth
necessary
they
may
never
sprout
if
they
are
four
to
six
inches
under
ground
the
black
walnut
tree
is
a
glutton
for
food
seemingly
it
will
use
all
the
fertilizer
that
it
is
given
although
no
doubt
there
is
a
practical
limit
it
must
have
plenty
of
food
to
produce
successive
crops
of
nuts
and
barnyard
manure
is
the
safest
and
most
practical
kind
to
use
this
can
be
put
on
as
a
heavy
mulch
around
the
trees
but
some
of
it
should
also
be
spaded
into
the
ground
one
must
always
remember
that
the
feeding
roots
of
a
tree
are
at
about
the
same
circumference
as
the
tips
of
the
branches
so
that
fertilizer
put
close
to
the
trunk
will
do
little
good
except
in
very
young
trees
since
we
have
been
watching
a
small
native
walnut
which
came
into
bearing
while
in
a
nursery
row
this
tree
bore
such
fine
nuts
and
lent
itself
so
readily
to
being
propagated
by
graftage
and
had
so
many
other
good
characteristics
that
we
have
selected
it
as
representative
of
the
black
walnut
varieties
for
the
north
and
have
named
it
the
weschcke
walnut
and
patented
the
variety

a
friend
of
mine
who
lives
in
mason
wisconsin
discovered
a
black
walnut
tree
growing
in
that
vicinity
since
mason
is
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
about
parallel
north
this
tree
grows
the
farthest
north
of
any
large
black
walnut
i
know
of
i
would
estimate
its
height
at
about
feet
and
its
trunk
diameter
at
about
sixteen
inches
at
because
of
the
short
growing
season
there
the
nuts
do
not
mature
being
barely
edible
due
to
their
shrinkage
while
drying
some
seasons
this
failure
to
mature
nuts
also
occurs
in
such
varieties
as
the
thomas
the
ohio
and
even
the
stabler
at
my
river
falls
farm
which
is
nearly
miles
south
of
mason
such
nuts
will
sprout
however
and
seedlings
were
raised
from
the
immature
nuts
of
this
northern
tree
incidentally
these
seedlings
appear
to
be
just
as
hardy
in
wood
growth
as
their
parent
tree
i
have
also
grafted
scionwood
from
the
original
tree
on
black
walnut
stocks
at
my
farm
in
order
to
determine
more
completely
the
quality
of
this
variety
since
grafted
these
trees
have
borne
large
easy
to
crack
mature
nuts
and
are
propagated
under
the
varietal
name
bayfield
since
the
parent
tree
is
in
sight
of
lake
superior
at
bayfield
wisconsin
many
of
our
best
nut
trees
from
man
point
of
view
have
inherent
faults
such
as
the
inability
of
the
staminate
bloom
of
the
weschcke
hickory
to
produce
any
pollen
whatsoever
as
has
been
scientifically
outlined
in
the
treatise
by
mckay
under
the
chapter
on
hickories
in
the
weschcke
walnut
we
have
a
peculiarity
of
a
similar
nature
as
it
affects
fruiting
when
the
tree
is
not
provided
with
other
varieties
to
act
as
pollinators
it
has
been
quite
definitely
established
by
observation
over
a
period
of
ten
or
more
years
that
the
pollen
of
the
weschcke
variety
black
walnut
does
not
cause
fruiting
in
its
own
pistillate
blooms
although
this
is
not
uncommon
among
some
plants
such
as
the
chestnut
and
the
filbert
where
it
is
generally
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
yet
in
the
black
walnuts
species
the
pollen
from
its
own
male
or
staminate
flowers
is
generally
capable
of
exciting
the
ovule
of
the
female
pistillate
flower
into
growth
such
species
are
known
as
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
chestnuts
which
receive
no
cross
pollination
and
the
pistillate
flowers
develop
into
perfect
burrs
with
shrunken
meatless
imperfect
nuts
the
weschcke
black
walnut
when
standing
alone
or
when
the
prevailing
winds
prevent
other
nearby
pollen
from
reaching
any
or
but
few
of
its
pistillate
bloom
goes
on
to
produce
fine
looking
nuts
practically
all
of
which
are
without
seed
or
kernels
such
therefore
is
the
importance
of
knowing
the
correct
pollinators
for
each
variety
of
nut
tree
in
the
of
filberts
the
failure
of
results
in
an
absence
of
nuts
or
in
very
few
rather
than
a
full
crop
of
seedless
fruits
such
as
the
common
chestnut
and
the
weschcke
black
walnuts
produces
this
is
the
only
black
walnut
that
has
come
to
the
attention
where
its
pollen
acting
on
its
pistillate
bloom
has
affected
the
production
of
nuts
in
just
this
way
but
the
variety
of
black
walnut
known
as
the
ohio
one
of
the
best
sorts
for
this
northern
climate
except
for
hardiness
has
often
demonstrated
that
it
has
a
peculiarity
which
might
be
caused
by
lack
of
outside
pollen
or
because
of
the
action
of
its
own
pollen
on
its
pistillate
bloom
this
peculiarity
is
the
often

fast
in

i
noticed
that

of

my
curiosity
led
me
to
taste
this

i
found
it
very
sweet
and
heavy
i
mean
to
experiment
some
time
in
making
syrup
from
the
sap
of
this
tree
as
i
believe
its
sugar
content
to
be
much
higher
than
that
of
the
local
sugar

this
makes
the
stabler
a
tree
the
first

the
second
being

third
being
at
the

the

is
one
of

having

weeping
willow
this
is
another
point
in
its
favor
its
being
an
ornamental
tree
worthy
of
any
lawn
however
the
stabler
is
now
considered
as
a
tender
variety
and
is
not
recommended
for

by
the
aesthetic
value
of
the
black
walnut
does
not
cease
here
since
there
are
some
varieties
which
are
exceptionally
attractive
one
of
these
is
the
black
walnut
which
has
the
ordinary
compound
leaf
but
whose
individual
leaflets
are
so
scalloped
and
serrated
that
they
resemble
a
male
fern
everyone
who
has
seen
one
of
these
has
evinced
pleasurable
surprise
at
this
new
form
of
leaf
and
it
may
become
very
popular
with
horticulturists
in
the
future
another
interestingly
different
variety
is
the
deming
purple
walnut
which
although
orthodox
in
leaf
form
has
a
purplish
tint
bordering
on
red
in
some
cases
coloring
leaf
wood
and
nuts
resulting
in
a
distinctly
decorative
tree
this
tree
was
named
for
deming
who
was
the
founder
of
the
northern
nut
association
neither
the
laceleaf
nor
deming
purple
are
hardy
for
this
climate
but
survived
several
years
nevertheless
before
succumbing
to
one
of
our
periodical
test
winters
chapter
hazels
and
filberts
in
october
i
ordered
from
jones
one
hundred
plants
of
what
is
known
as
the
rush
hazel
which
was
at
that
time
the
best
known
of
the
propagated
hazels
in
ordering
these
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
i
expected
to
get
layered
plants
or
grafted
ones
jones
wrote
me
at
once
to
say
that
the
plants
he
had
were
seedlings
of
the
rush
hazel
which
are
said
to
come
very
true
to
seed
but
that
if
i
did
not
want
them
as
seedlings
he
would
cancel
the
order
rather
than
lacking
a
profitable
filler
between
the
orchard
trees
i
accepted
the
order
of
one
hundred
plants
and
received
from
him
a
fine
lot
of
hazels
which
took
good
root
and
began
to
grow
luxuriantly
it
was
several
years
before
any
of
them
began
to
bear
and
when
one
or
two
did
the
nuts
were
not
hazels
at
all
but
filberts
and
hybrids
in
most
cases
these
nuts
were
larger
and
better
than
those
of
the
original
rush
hazel
one
of
these
seedlings
grew
into
a
bushy
tree
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
for
several
years
it
bore
a
crop
which
though
meager
was
composed
of
large
attractive
nuts
shaped
like
those
of
the
common
american
hazel
but
very
unlike
the
true
rush
hazelnut
one
year
this
tree
began
to
fail
and
i
tried
to
save
it
or
propagate
it
by
layering
and
sprouting
seeds
unfortunately
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
that
time
to
graft
it
to
a
wild
hazel
to
perpetuate
it
i
still
lament
my
oversight
as
the
tree
finally
died
and
a
very
hardy
plant
was
lost
which
was
apparently
able
to
fertilize
its
own
blossoms
i
ordered
four
winkler
hazel
bushes
from
snyder
of
center
point
iowa
in
march
asking
them
to
send
me
plants
that
were
extra
strong
and
of
bearing
size
i
planted
these
that
spring
but
the
following
summer
was
so
dry
that
all
four
died
i
ordered
twelve
more
winklers
in
september
for
spring
delivery
requesting
smaller
ones
this
time
two
to
three
feet
half
of
these
were
shipped
to
me
with
bare
roots
the
others
being
balled
in
dirt
for
experimental
purposes
four
of
the
latter
are
still
living
and
producing
nuts
in
april
i
planted
a
dozen
jones
hybrid
hazels
but
only
two
of
them
survived
more
than
two
years
i
think
the
reason
they
lasted
as
well
as
they
did
was
that
around
each
plant
i
put
a
guard
made
of
laths
four
feet
high
bound
together
with
wire
and
filled
with
forest
leaves
i
drove
the
laths
several
inches
into
the
ground
and
covered
them
with
window
screening
fastened
down
with
tacks
to
keep
mice
out
of
the
leaves
although
somewhat
most
of
the
plants
lived
during
the
first
winter
these
guards
were
used
the
second
winter
more
plants
died
and
i
did
use
the
guards
after
that
the
two
jones
hybrids
that
lived
produced
flowers
of
both
sexes
for
several
years
but
they
did
not
set
any
nuts
one
day
while
reading
a
report
of
one
of
the
previous
conventions
of
the
northern
nut
association
i
discovered
an
article
by
conrad
vollertsen
in
which
he
stressed
the
importance
of
training
filberts
into
a
single
truncated
plant
allowing
no
root
sprouts
or
suckers
to
spring
up
since
such
a
condition
prevents
the
bearing
of
nuts
i
followed
his
advice
with
my
two
jones
hybrids
and
removed
all
surplus
sprouts
this
resulted
in
more
abundant
flowers
and
some
abortive
involucres
but
still
no
nuts
developed
in
the
spring
of
i
systematically
fertilized
numerous
pistillate
flowers
of
these
plants
with
a
pollen
mixture
on
the
branches
so
treated
a
fairly
good
crop
of
nuts
similar
to
those
of
the
orthodox
jones
hybrid
appeared
i
had
cut
off
a
few
branches
from
the
jones
hybrids
when
i
received
them
and
grafted
these
to
wild
hazels
this
had
been
suggested
by
robert
morris
in
his
book
nut
growing
as
an
interesting
experiment
which
might
prove
to
be
practical
it
did
not
prove
to
be
so
for
me
for
although
the
grafting
itself
was
successful
i
found
it
tiresome
to
prune
repeatedly
the
suckers
which
constantly
spring
up
during
the
growing
period
and
which
are
detrimental
to
grafts
although
they
lived
for
five
years
these
grafts
suffered
a
great
deal
of
and
they
never
bore
nuts
the
one
which
lived
for
the
longest
time
became
quite
large
and
overgrew
the
stock
of
the
wild
hazel
this
same
plant
produced
both
staminate
and
pistillate
blossoms
very
abundantly
for
several
seasons
but
it
did
not
set
any
nuts
in
spite
of
the
many
wild
hazels
growing
nearby
which
gave
it
access
to
pollen
it
is
now
known
that
this
hybrid
is
and
must
have
pollinators
of
the
right
variety
in
order
to
bear
my
next
work
with
members
of
the
genus
corylus
was
discouraging
in
april
i
bought
one
hundred
hazel
and
filbert
plants
from
conrad
vollertsen
of
rochester
new
york
which
included
specimens
of
the
rush
hazel
and
of
the
following
varieties
of
filberts
italian
red
merribrook
kentish
cob
early
globe
zellernuts
white
lambert
althaldensleben
medium
long
bony
bush
large
globe
minnas
zeller
marveille
de
bollwyller
although
many
of
these
filberts
bore
nuts
the
first
year
they
were
planted
within
two
years
they
were
all
completely
in
i
received
ten
filbert
bushes
from
gellatly
of
west
bank
british
columbia
these
consisted
of
several
varieties
of
glover
best
introductions
and
some
pearson
seedlings
i
planted
them
on
the
south
side
of
a
high
stone
wall
a
favorable
location
for
plants
they
appeared
to
be
thrifty
and
only
slightly
during
the
first
two
years
but
by
all
but
two
of
the
bushes
had
died
or
were
dying
although
as
plants
they
have
been
of
little
value
to
me
their
pollen
has
been
of
great
service
i
found
an
unusually
fine
wild
hazel
growing
in
the
woods
on
my
farm
and
in
i
began
an
experiment
in
hybridizing
it
i
crossed
the
pistillate
flowers
of
the
native
hazel
with
pollen
from
a
gellatly
filbert
and
obtained
four
hybrid
plants
which
i
have
called
hazilberts
in
the
spring
of
three
of
these
hybrids
had
pistillate
flowers
but
no
staminate
blooms
as
i
was
very
eager
to
see
what
the
new
crosses
would
be
like
i
fertilized
the
blossoms
with
a
gunshot
mixture
of
pollen
from
other
plants
such
as
the
winkler
hazel
the
european
filbert
and
the
jones
hybrid
hazel
certain
difficulties
arose
in
making
these
hybrids
mainly
due
to
the
curiosity
of
the
squirrels
who
liked
to
rip
open
the
sacks
covering
the
blossoms
which
were
being
treated
deer
mice
too
i
found
have
a
habit
of
climbing
the
stems
of
hazel
bushes
and
gnawing
at
the
nuts
long
before
they
are
mature
enough
to
use
for
seed
later
i
learned
to
protect
hybrid
nuts
by
lacing
flat
pieces
of
window
screening
over
each
branch
thus
making
a
enclosure
even
after
gathering
the
nuts
i
discovered
that
precautions
were
necessary
to
prevent
rodents
from
reaching
them
the
best
way
i
found
to
do
this
is
to
plant
nuts
in
cages
of
galvanized
hardware
cloth
of
by
mesh
countersunk
in
the
ground
one
foot
and
covered
completely
by
a
frame
of
the
same
material
reinforced
with
boards
and
laths
the
most
interesting
hazilbert
that
has
developed
bears
nuts
of
outstanding
size
typically
filberts
in
every
detail
of
appearance
although
the
plant
itself
looks
more
like
a
hazel
being
bushy
and
having
many
suckers
after
more
testing
this
hybrid
may
prove
to
be
a
definite
asset
to
nursery
culture
in
our
cold
northern
climate
fulfilling
as
it
does
all
the
requirements
for
such
a
plant
the
second
hazilbert
resembles
the
first
closely
except
that
its
nuts
which
are
also
large
are
shaped
like
those
of
corylus
americana
the
third
hazilbert
has
smaller
nuts
but
its
shell
is
much
thinner
than
that
of
either
of
the
others
in
reference
to
the
hazilberts
i
am
reminded
of
certain
correspondence
i
once
had
with
jones
he
had
sent
me
samples
of
the
rush
hazel
and
although
i
was
impressed
by
them
i
mentioned
in
replying
to
him
that
we
had
wild
hazels
growing
in
our
pasture
which
were
as
large
or
larger
than
the
rush
hazelnuts
i
admitted
that
ours
were
usually
very
much
infested
with
the
hazel
weevil
jones
was
immediately
interested
in
wild
hazels
of
such
size
and
asked
me
to
send
him
samples
of
them
he
wrote
that
he
had
never
seen
wild
hazels
with
worms
in
them
and
would
like
to
learn
more
about
them
i
sent
him
both
good
and
wormy
nuts
from
the
wild
hazel
bush
to
which
i
had
referred
he
was
so
impressed
by
them
that
he
wished
me
to
dig
up
the
plant
and
ship
it
to
him
writing
that
he
wished
to
cross
it
with
filbert
pollen
as
an
experiment
i
sent
it
as
he
asked
but
before
he
was
able
to
make
the
cross
he
intended
his
death
occurred
several
years
later
his
daughter
mildred
wrote
to
me
about
this
hazel
bush
asking
if
i
knew
where
her
father
had
planted
it
unfortunately
i
could
give
her
no
information
about
where
among
his
many
experiments
this
bush
would
be
so
that
the
plant
was
lost
sight
of
for
a
time
later
miss
jones
sent
me
nuts
from
a
bush
which
she
thought
might
be
the
one
i
had
sent
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
identify
those
nuts
as
being
indeed
from
that
bush
in
the
spring
of
i
crossed
the
winkler
hazel
with
filbert
pollen
the
european
hazel
with
winkler
pollen
the
gellatly
filbert
with
jones
hybrid
pollen
these
crosses
produced
many
plants
which
will
be
new
and
interesting
types
to
watch
and
build
from
i
have
already
made
certain
discoveries
about
them
by
close
examination
of
about
forty
plants
i
have
been
able
to
determine
that
at
least
five
are
definitely
hybrids
by
the
color
shape
and
size
of
their
buds
this
is
a
very
strong
indication
of
hybridity
with
wild
hazel
or
winkler
on
one
of
these
plants
about
high
i
found
staminate
bloom
which
i
consider
unusual
after
only
two
seasons
growth
during
the
fall
of
i
became
interested
in
a
phenomenon
of
fruit
determination
previous
to
actual
fructification
of
the
plant
by
detailed
examinations
of
its
buds
i
noticed
for
instance
that
large
buds
generally
meant
that
the
plant
would
produce
large
nuts
and
small
buds
indicated
small
nuts
to
come
the
color
of
the
buds
whether
they
were
green
bronze
green
or
reddish
brown
could
be
fairly
well
depended
upon
to
indicate
their
hybridity
in
many
cases
these
tests
were
not
wholly
reliable
but
the
percentage
of
indication
was
so
high
that
i
was
tempted
to
make
predictions
at
that
time
hazilbert
no
had
not
borne
nuts
the
bush
resembled
a
wild
hazel
so
much
that
i
had
begun
to
doubt
its
hybridity
upon
examining
its
buds
i
found
indications
in
their
color
that
it
was
a
hybrid
although
the
nuts
apparently
would
not
be
large
it
would
be
an
important
plant
to
me
only
if
its
pollen
should
prove
to
be
effective
on
the
other
hazilberts
at
the
time
this
was
only
a
wishful
hope
because
the
pollen
of
the
wild
hazel
which
this
plant
resembles
apparently
does
not
act
to
excite
the
ovules
of
either
filberts
or
filbert
hybrids
with
filbert
characteristics
pure
filbert
pollen
seemed
to
be
necessary
in
its
pollen
did
prove
to
be
acceptable
to
the
other
hazilberts
and
my
hope
for
a
good
pollinizer
was
realized
in
it
from
the
conclusions
i
reached
through
my
study
of
the
buds
i
made
sketches
of
which
i
believed
the
nuts
of
no
would
be
like
in
size
and
shape
in
march
these
sketches
were
used
as
the
basis
of
the
drawing
given
here
a
comparison
of
this
drawing
with
the
photograph
taken
in
september
of
the
actual

of

show
how
accurate
such
a
predetermination
can
be
i
am
convinced
from
the
work
i
have
done
and
am
still
doing
that
we
are
developing
several
varieties
of
hazilberts
as
hardy
and
adaptable
to
different
soils
as
the

is

prior

of
chapter
hazels
filberts
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
in
the
minds
of
many
people
regarding
the
difference
between
filberts
and
hazels
both
of
which
belong
to
the
genus
corylus
some
think
them
identical
and
call
them
all
hazels
dividing
them
only
into
european
and
american
types
i
see
no
reason
for
doing
this
filbert
is
the
name
of
one
species
of
genus
corylus
just
as
english
walnut
is
the
commercial
name
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
juglans
family
there
is
as
much
difference
between
a
filbert
and
a
common
wild
hazelnut
as
there
is
between
a
cultivated
english
walnut
and
wild
black
walnut
for
ordinary
purposes
the
nuts
sold
commercially
whether
imported
or
grown
in
this
country
are
called
filberts
while
those
nuts
which
may
be
found
growing
prolifically
in
woodlands
and
pastures
over
almost
the
whole
united
states
but
which
are
not
to
be
found
on
the
market
are
called
hazelnuts
this
lack
of
commercialization
of
hazelnuts
should
be
recognized
as
due
to
the
smallness
of
the
nut
and
the
thickness
of
its
shell
rather
than
to
its
lacking
flavor
its
flavor
which
seldom
varies
much
regardless
of
size
shape
or
thickness
of
shell
is
both
rich
and
nutty
the
three
main
food
components
of
the
hazelnut
carbohydrate
protein
and
oil
are
balanced
so
well
that
they
approach
nearer
than
most
other
nuts
the
ideal
food
essential
to
man
the
english
walnut
contains
much
oil
and
protein
while
both
chestnuts
and
acorns
consist
largely
of
carbohydrates
one
salient
feature
which
definitely
separates
the
species
corylus
americana
or
wild
hazel
from
others
of
its
genus
is
its
resistance
to
hazel
blight
a
native
fungus
disease
of
which
it
is
the
host
controversies
may
occur
over
the
application
of
the
names
hazel
and
filbert
but
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
effect
of
this
infection
on
members
of
genus
corylus
imported
from
europe
although
there
is
wide
variety
in
appearance
and
quality
within
each
of
the
species
especially
among
the
european
filberts
and
although
filberts
may
resemble
hazels
sufficiently
to
confuse
even
a
horticulturist
the
action
of
this
fungus
is
so
specific
that
it
divides
corylus
definitely
into
two
species
corylus
americana
and
corylus
cornuta
through
long
association
have
become
comparatively
immune
to
its
effects
and
quickly
wall
off
infected
areas
while
filbert
plants
are
soon
killed
by
contact
with
it
hybrids
between
filberts
and
hazels
will
usually
be
found
to
retain
some
of
the
resistance
of
the
hazel
parent
the
ideal
nut
of
genus
corylus
should
combine
qualities
of
both
hazels
and
filberts
such
a
hybrid
should
have
the
bushy
characteristics
of
the
american
hazel
with
its
properties
and
its
ability
to
reproduce
itself
by
stolons
or
it
should
bear
fruit
having
the
size
general
shape
cracking
qualities
and
good
flavor
of
the
filbert
as
popularly
known
the
hybrids
i
am
growing
at
my
farm
which
i
call
hazilberts
and
which
are
discussed
later
seem
to
fulfill
these
requirements
the
plants
may
be
grown
as
bushes
or
small
trees
they
are
and
their
nuts
are
like
filberts
in
appearance
three
varieties
of
these
hazilberts
have
kernels
which
are
practically
free
of
pellicle
or
fibre
they
have
a
good
flavor
a
comparison
of
the
ripening
habits
and
the
effect
of
frost
on
the
various
members
of
the
genus
corylus
growing
in
my
nursery
in
the
fall
of
is
shown
by
these
extracts
taken
from
daily
records
of
the
work
done
there
it
should
be
noted
that
the
summer
season
that
year
was
rainy
and
not
as
hot
as
usual
so
that
most
nuts
ripened
two
to
three
weeks
later
than
they
normally
do
september
and
wild
hazels
ripe
and
picked
at
this
time
their
kernels
showed
no
shrinkage
by
october
september
and
i
picked
ripe
nuts
from
hazilbert
no
which
seems
to
be
the
first
to
ripen
also
picked
half
of
the
european
filberts
there
was
slight
shrinkage
in
the
kernels
of
the
latter
a
few
weeks
later
showing
that
they
could
have
stayed
on
the
trees
another
week
to
advantage
all
of
the
nuts
of
a
jones
hybrid
which
is
a
cross
between
rush
and
some
european
variety
such
as
italian
red
could
have
been
picked
as
they
were
ripe
some
were
picked
the
filbert
classified
as
the
white
aveline
type
was
not
quite
ripe
neither
were
hazilberts
no
and
no
nor
the
gellatly
filberts
wild
hazelnuts
at
this
time
had
dry
husks
and
were
falling
off
the
bushes
or
being
cut
down
by
mice
september
and
the
remaining
european
filberts
of
the
imported
plants
were
picked
also
i
picked
half
of
the
white
aveline
type
nuts
illustration
hazilberts
no
about
this
is
the
earliest
ripening
and
thinnest
shell
of
the
large
type
hazilberts
not
the
largest
size
however
carlola
weschcke
shown
in

photo
by
september
and
we
picked
most
of
the
nuts
remaining
on
hazilbert
no
and
the
remainder
of
the
white
aveline
type
at
this
time
we
record
a
heavy
frost
which
occurred
during
the
previous
week
that
is
between
september
and
since
it
froze
water
it
was
considered
a
killing
frost
however
the
damage
was
spotty
all
over
the
orchard
most
things
continuing
to
develop
and
ripen
winkler
hazels
picked
and
examined
at
this
time
showed
them
far
from
ripe
hazilberts
growing
next
to
limestone
walls
on
the
south
side
showed
no
signs
of
frost
damage
whereas
the
winkler
on
higher
ground
showed
severe
damage
to
the
leaves
and
the
husks
of
the
nuts
which
immediately
started
to
turn
brown
leaves
of
other
filbert
plants
in
the
vicinity
showed
no
frost
damage
and
the
very
few
nuts
that
had
been
left
on
such
as
those
of
the
jones
hybrid
were
undamaged
october
and
picked
all
of
hazilbert
no
except
the
last
two
nuts
gellatly
filberts
were
picked
about
october
and
were
ripe
at
that
time
october
to
two
english
walnuts
were
picked
and
found
to
be
as
ripe
as
they
would
get
these
as
well
as
the
black
walnuts
showed
distinct
signs
of
lacking
summer
heat
needed
for
their
proper
development
the
last
two
nuts
on
hazilbert
no
and
the
only
nut
on
hazilbert
no
were
picked
at
this
time
and
were
ripe
chestnut
burrs
had
opened
up
and
the
nuts
enclosed
were
fully
mature
october
and
i
found
the
last
of
the
winkler
hazelnuts
had
been
picked
during
the
previous
week
approximately
october
these
were
left
the
longest
on
the
bush
of
any
hazel
and
still
were
not
ripe
although
they
were
not
entirely
killed
by
the
several
frosts
occurring
before
that
time
they
are
always
much
later
than
the
wild
hazel
on
october
i
had
an
opportunity
of
comparing
the
action
of
frost
on
the
leaves
of
these
plants
those
of
the
white
aveline
type
had
not
changed
color
and
were
very
green
the
leaves
of
the
jones
hybrid
showed
some
coloration
but
nothing
to
compare
with
those
of
the
winkler
hazel
many
of
which
had
the
most
beautiful
colors
of
any
of
the
trees
on
the
farm
red
orange
and
yellow
bronze
hazilbert
no
which
resembles
a
wild
hazel
in
appearance
and
habits
of
growth
had
colored
much
earlier
in
reaction
to
the
frost
and
was
as
brightly
tinted
as
the
wild
hazel
and
winkler
plants
except
that
like
the
wild
hazel
it
had
already
lost
much
of
its
foliage
some
of
the
wild
hazels
were
entirely
devoid
of
leaves
at
this
time
hazilbert
no
showed
the
best
color
effects
with
no
second
and
no
last
the
color
of
the
leaves
and
the
action
of
the
frost
on
the
plants
during
the
autumn
is
another
thing
in
my
opinion
that
helps
to
differentiate
between
and
to
classify
european
filberts
american
hazels
and
their
hybrids
my
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
frost
is
that
the
reaction
of
the
winkler
hazel
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
wild
hazel
in
color
but
exceeding
it
in
beauty
since
its
leaves
do
not
drop
as
soon
after
coloring
at
this
time
the
leaves
had
not
changed
color
on
the
imported
european
plants
the
gellatly
filberts
from
british
columbia
or
the
white
aveline
type
they
had
turned
only
slightly
on
the
jones
hybrid
i
think
an
accurate
idea
of
the
general
hardiness
of
a
plant
is
indicated
by
the
effect
of
frost
and
by
early
dropping
of
leaves
using
the
sturdy
wild
hazel
as
the
limit
of
hardiness
and
assuming
that
its
hardiness
is
shown
by
both
degree
of
coloration
and
early
dropping
of
leaves
in
noting
the
action
of
frost
on
the
winkler
hazel
i
have
mentioned
that
it
was
more
like
that
on
the
american
hazel
than
on
the
european
filberts
the
winkler
has
always
been
considered
a
native
woodland
hazel
but
although
it
does
show
several
similarities
to
corylus
americana
i
have
also
noticed
certain
qualities
which
definitely
suggest
some
filbert
heritage
i
have
based
my
theory
on
a
study
of
the
winkler
hazels
which
have
been
bearing
annually
at
my
farm
for
six
years
bearing
more
regularly
in
fact
than
even
the
wild
hazels
growing
nearby
my
comparisons
have
been
made
with
wild
hazels
in
both
minnesota
and
wisconsin
and
with
european
filberts
i
found
the
first
point
of
similarity
with
the
filbert
is
in
the
involucre
covering
the
nut
in
the
wild
hazel
this
folds
against
itself
to
one
side
of
the
nut
while
in
the
filbert
it
is
about
balanced
and
if
not
already
exposing
a
large
part
of
the
end
of
the
nut
is
easily
opened
the
involucre
of
the
winkler
hazel
is
formed
much
more
like
that
of
the
filbert
than
that
of
the
hazel
in
corylus
americana
this
involucre
is
usually
thick
tough
and
watery
while
in
the
filbert
it
is
thinner
and
drier
so
that
while
a
person
may
be
deceived
in
the
size
of
a
hazelnut
still
in
its
husk
he
can
easily
tell
that
of
a
filbert
this
is
also
true
of
the
winkler
whose
involucre
is
fairly
thick
but
outlines
the
form
of
the
enclosed
nut
another
feature
about
the
involucre
of
the
winkler
which
classes
it
with
the
filberts
rather
than
the
hazels
is
in
its
appearance
and
texture
which
is
smooth
and
velvety
while
that
of
the
hazel
is
hairy
and
wrinkled
the
staminate
blooms
of
the
winkler
hazel
show
similarity
to
those
of
both
filberts
and
hazels
sometimes
they
appear
in
formation
at
the
ends
of
branches
much
as
those
of
the
european
filberts
do
in
overlapping
groups
of
three
or
four
again
they
may
be
found
at
regular
intervals
at
the
axis
of
leaf
stems
very
much
as
in
the
case
of
the
american
hazel
the
buds
on
the
winkler
hazel
are
dull
red
which
is
also
true
of
those
on
the
hybrid
hazilberts
another
indication
of
hybridity
the
initial
growth
of
the
embryo
nut
is
very
slow
in
the
winkler
as
it
is
in
the
filbert
as
contrasted
with
the
very
rapid
development
of
the
native
hazel
embryo
which
matures
in
this
latitude
about
one
month
ahead
of
the
winklers
and
some
filberts
although
winkler
nuts
are
shaped
like
hazels
and
have
the
typically
thick
shells
of
hazelnuts
their
size
is
more
that
of
a
filbert
usually
three
times
as
large
as
a
native
hazel
during
the
years
between
and
many
new
hybrids
between
filberts
and
hazels
were
produced
four
wild
varieties
of
hazels
which
had
unusual
characteristics
such
as
tremendous
bearing
and
large
size
nuts
and
others
having
very
early
maturing
or
very
thin
shelled
nuts
were
used
as
the
female
parents
in
making
the
crosses
pollen
was
obtained
from
other
parts
of
the
or
from
filbert
bushes
which
were
growing
on
the
place
crosses
included
pollen
of
the
barcelona
duchilly
red
aveline
white
aveline
purple
aveline
the
italian
red
daviana
and
several
hybrids
between
other
filberts
and
hazels
by
the
number
of
these
plants
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
and
by
considerable
knowledge
had
been
gained
as
to
the
hardiness
blight
resistance
to
the
common
hazel
blight
known
scientifically
as
cryptosporella
anomala
freedom
from
the
curculio
of
the
hazelnuts
commonly
known
as
the
hazel
weevil
and
resistance
to
other
insect
pests
also
considerable
data
had
been
accumulated
by
cataloging
over
trees
each
year
for
five
years
cataloging
included
varied
and
detailed
studies
of
their
growth
bearing
habits
ability
to
resist
blight
curculio
and
other
insects
the
size
of
the
nut
the
thinness
of
the
shell
and
the
flavor
of
the
kernel
several
books
of
all
this
detail
were
accumulated
in
trying
to
nail
down
several
commercial
varieties
that
would
be
propagated
from
this
vast
amount
of
material
although
some
bushes
produced
good
nuts
at
the
rate
of
as
much
as
two
tons
to
the
acre
measured
on
the
basis
of
space
that
they
took
up
in
the
test
orchard
the
most
prolific
kind
seemed
to
be
the
ones
that
had
a
tendency
to
revert
to
the
wild
hazel
type
the
better
and
types
more
resembling
the
filberts
seemed
to
be
shy
bearers
so
that
there
being
a
host
of
new
plants
to
catalog
more
than
which
had
not
indicated
their
bearing
characteristics
we
included
these
among
the
possible
ideal
plants
we
were
seeking
although
there
were
several
plants
that
could
be
considered
commercial
in
the
original
group
of
over
it
has
been
thought
that
the
waiting
of
a
few
more
years
to
ascertain
whether
there
would
be
something
better
in
the
next
plants
to
bear
that
would
be
worthwhile
waiting
for
and
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
propagate
the
earlier
tested
plants
some
of
these
tested
hybrids
proved
to
have
nuts
that
were
classed
as
giants
being
much
larger
than
the
filberts
produced
by
male
or
pollen
parent
such
as
the
barcelona
duchilly
or

pecans
and
their
hybrids
at
the
same
time
october
that
i
purchased
beaver
hickory
trees
from
jones
i
also
procured
from
him
three
specimens
each
of
three
commercial
varieties
of
pecan
trees
the
posey
indiana
and
niblack
as
well
as
some
hiccan
trees
hybrids
having
pecan
and
hickory
parents
only
one
tree
survived
a
niblack
pecan
which
after
sixteen
years
was
only
about
eighteen
inches
in
height
its
annual
growth
was
very
slight
and
it
was
killed
back
during
the
winter
almost
the
full
amount
of
the
year
growth
in
the
year
this
tree
was
dead
in
september
at
a
convention
of
the
northern
nut
association
in
louis
missouri
i
became
acquainted
with
a
man
whose
experience
in
the
industry
was
wide
and
who
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
types
of
hickory
and
pecan
trees
in
iowa
he
was
snyder
of
center
point
iowa
he
later
became
president
of
the
association
in
one
of
his
letters
to
me
the
following
summer
snyder
mentioned
that
there
were
wild
pecan
trees
growing
near
des
moines
and
burlington
i
decided
i
wanted
to
know
more
about
them
and
at
my
request
he
collected
ten
pounds
of
the
nuts
for
me
i
found
they
were
the
long
type
of
pecan
small
but
surprisingly
and
having
a
kernel
of
very
high
quality
i
first
planted
these
nuts
in
an
open
garden
in
paul
but
after
a
year
i
moved
them
to
my
farm
where
i
set
them
out
in
nursery
rows
in
an
open
field
the
soil
there
was
a
poor
grade
of
clay
not
really
suited
to
nut
trees
but
even
so
most
of
the
ones
still
remaining
there
have
made
reasonably
good
growth
i
used
a
commercial
fertilizing
compound
around
about
half
of
these
seedlings
which
greatly
increased
their
rate
of
growth
although
they
became
less
hardy
than
the
unfertilized
ones
after
five
years
i
transplanted
a
number
of
them
to
better
soil
in
orchard
formation
although
i
have
only
about
fifty
of
the
original
three
hundred
seedlings
having
lost
the
others
mainly
during
droughts
these
remaining
ones
have
done
very
well
some
of
these
trees
have
been
bearing
small
crops
of
nuts
during
the
years
to
date
the
most
mature
nuts
of
these
were
planted
and
to
date
i
have
second
generation
pure
pecan
trees
to
testify
as
to
the
ability
of
the
northern
pecan
to
become
acclimated
i
gave
several
of
the
original
seedlings
to
friends
who
planted
them
in
their
gardens
where
rich
soil
has
stimulated
them
to
grow
at
twice
the
rate
of
those
on
my
farm
there
were
four
individual
pecan
trees
growing
in
or
near
paul
from
my
first
planting
the
largest
being
about
feet
high
with
a
caliber
of
five
inches
a
foot
above
ground
although
this
tree
did
not
bear
nuts
i
have
used
it
as
a
source
of
scionwood
for
several
years
these
graftings
made
on
bitternut
hickory
stock
have
been
so
successful
that
i
am
continuing
their
propagation
at
my
nursery
having
named
this
variety
the
hope
pecan
for
joseph
hope
the
man
who
owns
the
parent
tree
and
who
takes
such
an
interest
in
it
illustration
the
use
of
a
zinc
metal
tag
fastened
by
or
gauge
copper
wire
to
branch
of
by
the
year
the
tree
had
such
a
straggly
appearance
although
still
healthy
and
growing
but
being
too
shaded
by
large
trees
on
the
boulevard
that
hope
caused
it
to
be
cut
down
the
variety
is
still
growing
at
my
farm
grafted
on
bitternut
stocks
and
although
blossoming
it
has
never
produced
a
nut
up
to
this
time
another
tree
given
to
joseph
posch
of
the
city
of
paul
minnesota
had
made
even
better
growth
and
was
luxuriantly
healthy
and
in
bloom
when
it
was
cut
down
by
the
owner
because
the
branches
overhung
the
fence
line
into
a
neighbor
yard
this
was
done
in
about
another
tree
given
to
wm
eldridge
of
paul
still
flourishes
and
is
quite
large
in
at
breast
height
inches
in
diameter
but
being
in
a
dense
shade
it
has
not
borne
any
nuts
the
fourth
tree
given
to
john
straus
the
famous
skate
maker
presumably
exists
at
his
lake
residence
north
of
paul
i
have
not
seen
it
in
the
last
seven
or
eight
years
although
they
are
not
as
hardy
as
bitternut
stocks
i
have
found
the
wild
iowa
pecan
seedlings
satisfactory
for
grafting
after
five
growth
i
use
them
as
an
understock
for
grafting
the
posey
indiana
and
major
varieties
of
northern
pecan
and
find
them
preferable
to
northern
bitternut
stocks
with
which
the
pecans
are
not
compatible
for
long
as
a
rule
such
a
union
resulting
in
a
stunted
tree
which
is
easily
although
the
posey
continued
to
live
for
several
years
our
severe
winters
finally
put
an
end
to
all
these
fine
pecans
the
root
system
of
the
seedling
understock
continued
to
live
however
i
chanced
to
discover
an
interesting
thing
in
the
fall
of
which
suggests
something
new
in
pecan
propagation
there
were
two
small
pecans
growing
in
the
same
rows
as
the
large
ones
planted
fifteen
years
previously
when
i
noticed
them
i
thought
they
were
some
of
this
same
planting
and
that
they
had
been
injured
or
frozen
back
to
such
an
extent
that
they
were
mere
sprouts
again
for
this
has
happened
i
decided
to
move
them
and
asked
one
of
the
men
on
the
farm
to
dig
them
up
when
he
had
dug
the
first
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
was
a
sprout
from
the
main
tap
root
of
a
large
pecan
tree
which
had
been
taken
out
and
transplanted
the
same
was
true
of
the
second
one
except
that
in
this
case
we
found
three
tap
roots
the
two
outside
ones
both
having
shoots
which
were
showing
above
the
ground
another
remarkable
circumstance
about
this
was
that
these
tap
roots
had
been
cut
off
twenty
inches
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
the
sprouts
had
to
come
all
that
distance
to
start
new
trees
all
of
this
suggests
the
possibility
of
pecan
propagation
by
root
cuttings
these
two
pecans
at
least
show
a
natural
tendency
to
do
this
and
i
have
marked
them
for
further
experimentation
along
such
lines
on
the
advice
of
the
late
harry
weber
of
cincinnati
ohio
an
eminent
nut
culturist
who
after
visiting
my
nursery
in
became
very
anxious
to
try
out
some
of
the
indiana
varieties
of
pecans
in
our
northern
climate
i
wrote
to
ford
wilkinson
a
noted
propagator
of
nut
trees
at
rockport
indiana
suggesting
that
he
make
some
experimental
graftings
at
my
farm
both
wilkinson
and
weber
gathered
scionwood
from
all
the
black
walnut
pecan
hiccan
and
hickory
trees
at
their
disposal
for
this
trial
there
was
enough
of
it
to
keep
three
of
us
busy
for
a
week
grafting
it
on
large
trees
our
equipment
was
carried
on
a
trailer
attached
to
a
tractor
and
we
were
saved
the
trouble
of
having
to
carry
personally
scions
packing
material
wax
pots
knives
pruning
shears
tying
material
canvas
and
ladders
into
the
woods
wilkinson
remarked
on
starting
out
that
in
the
interests
of
experimental
grafting
he
had
travelled
on
foot
on
horseback
by
mule
team
and
in
rowboats
but
that
this
was
his
first
experience
with
a
tractor
when
he
saw
the
type
of
grafting
with
which
i
had
been
getting
good
results
wilkinson
was
astounded
he
declared
that
using
a
graft
in
the
south
resulted
in
failure
while
i
had
more
than
success
with
it
he
was
willing
to
discard
his
type
of
grafting
for
mine
which
was
adequate
for
the
work
we
were
doing
but
i
wanted
to
check
his
grafting
performance
and
urged
him
to
continue
with
his
own
an
adaptation
of
the
graft
to
the
end
of
a
stub
we
both
used
paper
sacks
to
shade
our
grafts
although
results
proved
that
my
methods
averaged
a
slightly
higher
percentage
of
successful
graftings
in
this
latitude
and
for
the
type
of
work
we
were
doing
his
would
nonetheless
be
superior
in
working
over
trees
larger
than
four
inches
in
diameter
and
having
no
lateral
branches
up
to
eight
feet
above
ground
at
which
height
it
is
most
convenient
to
cut
off
a
large
hickory
preparatory
to
working
on
it
in
the
late
fall
of
that
year
we
cut
scionwood
of
the
season
growth
and
inverted
large
burlap
bags
stuffed
with
leaves
over
the
grafts
the
bags
braced
on
the
inside
by
laths
to
prevent
their
collapsing
on
the
grafts
so
we
have
perpetuated
the
following
varieties
hickories
cedar

taylor
barnes
fairbanks
hiccans
mcalester
bixby

moines
rockville

the
varieties
were
finally

that

six

of

only
one
has
survived
up
to

is
now
a

the

by

between

there
are
several
varieties
as
i
mentioned
before
of
these
the
mcalester
is
the
most
outstanding
its
nuts
measuring
over
three
inches
in
circumference
and
about
three
inches
long
horticulturists
believe
that
this
hybrid
is
the
result
of
a
cross
between
a
hickory
which
produces
the
largest
nut
of
any
hickory
growing
in
the
united
states
and
a
large
pecan
i
have
experimented
a
number
of
times
with
the
mcalester
and
my
conclusion
is
that
it
is
not
hardy
enough
to
advocate
its
being
grown
in
this
climate
there
are
other
hiccans
hardier
than
it
is
however
such
as
the
rockville
burlington
green
bay
and
des
moines
and
it
is
certain
that
the
north
is
assured
of
hardy
pecans
and
a
few
hardy
hybrids
which
although
they
do
not
bear
the
choicest
pecan
nuts
make
interesting
and
beautiful
lawn
trees
indeed
as
an
ornamental
tree
the
pecan
is
superior
to
the
native
hickory
in
two
definite
ways
by
its
exceedingly
long
life
which
may
often
reach
over
years
as
contrasted
with
the
average
hickory
span
of
years
and
by
its
greater
size
one
pecan
tree
i
saw
growing
in
easton
maryland
in
for
example
was
then
seventeen
feet
in
circumference
at
one
hundred
feet
in
height
and
having
a
spread
of
one
hundred
fifty
feet
the
wood
of
the
pecan
is
similar
to
that
of
the
hickory
in
both
toughness
and
specific
gravity
although
for
practical
purposes
such
as
being
used
for
tool
handles
the
shagbark
hickory
is
enough
harder
and
tougher
to
make
it
the
superior
of
the
two
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
on
october
when
a
pecan
seedling
of
the
iowa
origin
which
had
not
yet
borne
any
nuts
showed
a
small
crop
these
nuts
were
fully
matured
and
were
of
sufficient
size
so
that
they
could
be
considered
a
valuable
new
variety
of
pecan
nut
for
the
north
a
plate
showing
a
few
of
these
pecans
illustrates
by
means
of
a
ruler
the
actual
size
of
these
pecans
and
the
fact
that
they
matured
so
well
by
october
indicates
that
in
many
seasons
they
may
be
relied
upon
to
mature
their
crop
no
other
data
has
been
acquired
on
this
variety
and
we
can
only
be
thankful
that
we
can
expect
it
to
do
a
little
better
in
size
as
successive
crops
appear
which
is
the
usual
way
of
nut
trees
also
by
fertilizing
this
tree
we
can
expect
bigger
nuts
as
is
generally
the
case
the
shell
of
this
pecan
is
so
thin
that
it
can
be
easily
cracked
with
the
teeth
which
i
have
done
repeatedly
and
although
small
is
than
any
standard
pecan
chapter
hickory
the
king
the
acknowledged
autocrat
of
all
the
native
nuts
is
the
hickory
perhaps
not
all
the
experts
admit
this
leadership
but
it
is
certainly
the
opinion
held
by
most
people
of
course
when
i
speak
of
the
hickory
nut
in
this
high
regard
i
refer
to
the
shagbark
hickory
which
as
a
wild
tree
is
native
as
far
north
as
the
parallel
in
minnesota
and
wisconsin
and
somewhat
farther
in
the
eastern
states
wild
hickory
nuts
have
been
commercialized
only
to
a
slight
extent
its
crops
are
almost
entirely
consumed
in
the
locality
in
which
they
are
grown
by
those
people
who
find
great
pleasure
in
spending
fine
autumn
days
gathering
them
the
obvious
reason
why
hickory
nuts
have
not
been
made
a
product
of
commerce
lies
in
the
nut
itself
which
is
usually
very
small
and
which
has
a
shell
so
strong
and
thick
that
the
kernel
can
be
taken
out
only
in
small
pieces
the
toughness
of
the
shell
makes
cracking
difficult
too
and
since
only
rarely
is
one
found
that
can
be
broken
by
a
hand
cracker
it
is
necessary
to
use
the
method
it
is
quite
possible
though
that
some
day
the
hickory
will
rival
or
exceed
its
near
relative
the
wild
pecan
in
commercial
favor
the
wild
pecans
which
formerly
came
on
the
market
at
christmastime
in
mixtures
of
nuts
were
just
as
difficult
to
extract
from
their
shells
as
the
wild
shagbark
hickory
nuts
are
now
by
means
of
selection
and
cultivation
the
pecan
was
changed
from
a
small
nut
to
that
of
a
large
nut
whose
kernel
was
extractable
in
whole
halves
among
many
thousands
of
wild
pecan
trees
were
a
few
which
bore
exceptionally
fine
nuts
nuts
similar
to
those
now
found
at
every
grocery
store
and
called
papershell
pecans
these
unusual
nuts
were
propagated
by
grafting
twigs
from
their
parent
trees
on
ordinary
wild
pecan
trees
whose
own
nuts
were
of
less
value
these
grafted
trees
were
set
out
in
orchards
where
they
produce
the
millions
of
pounds
of
pecans
now
on
the
market
the
question
which
naturally
occurs
is
why
has
this
been
done
with
hickory
nuts
hundreds
of
attempts
have
been
made
to
do
so
by
the
greatest
nut
propagators
in
the
united
states
they
have
been
successful
in
grafting
outstanding
varieties
of
hickory
to
wild
root
stocks
but
the
time
involved
has
prevented
any
practical
or
commercial
success
since
most
grafted
hickories
require
a
period
of
growth
from
ten
to
twenty
years
before
bearing
any
nuts
this
length
of
time
contrasts
very
unfavorably
with
that
required
by
grafted
pecans
which
produce
nuts
on
quite
young
trees
frequently
within
three
to
five
years
after
grafting
this
factor
of
slow
growth
has
set
the
pecan
far
ahead
of
the
tasty
shagbark
hickory
experimenters
have
long
thought
to
reduce
the
time
required
by
the
hickory
to
reach
maturity
by
grafting
it
to
hickory
roots
such
as
the
bitternut
or
the
closely
related
pecan
both
of
these
grow
rapidly
and
the
bitternut
has
the
additional
advantage
of
growing
farther
north
and
of
being
transplanted
more
easily
it
has
always
been
thought
that
when
a
good
variety
of
shagbark
hickory
had
been
successfully
grafted
to
bitternut
root
stocks
orchards
of
hickory
trees
would
soon
appear
this
takes
me
to
my
discovery
of
the
variety
now
known
as
the
weschcke
hickory
which
i
have
found
fulfills
the
necessary
conditions
illustration

drawing
by
wm
one
fall
day
in
when
i
was
at
the
home
of
a
neighboring
farmer
he
offered
me
some
mixed
hickory
nuts
he
had
received
from
an
uncle
in
iowa
as
he
knew
of
my
interest
in
nuts
he
wanted
my
opinion
of
them
i
looked
them
over
and
explained
that
they
were
no
better
than
little
nutmegs
having
very
hard
shells
and
a
small
proportion
of
inaccessible
meat
to
demonstrate
this
i
cracked
some
between
hammer
and
flatiron
my
demonstration
was
conclusive
until
i
hit
one
nut
which
almost
melted
under
the
force
i
was
applying
the
shape
of
this
nut
was
enough
different
from
the
others
to
enable
me
to
pick
out
a
handful
like
it
from
the
mixture
i
was
amazed
to
see
how
very
and
full
of
meat
they
were
upon
my
request
this
neighbor
wrote
to
his
uncle
john
bailey
of
fayette
iowa
asking
if
he
knew
from
which
tree
such
fine
nuts
had
come
unfortunately
he
did
not
because
the
nuts
had
been
gathered
from
quite
a
large
area
after
corresponding
with
bailey
myself
i
decided
that
i
would
go
there
and
help
him
locate
the
tree
although
it
was
nearly
christmas
and
heavy
snowfalls
which
already
covered
the
ground
would
make
our
search
more
difficult

i
called
on

who
was
glad
to
help
me
hunt
out
the
tree
in
which
i
had
so
much
interest
we
called
fobes
the
owner
of
the
farm
from
which
the
nuts
were
believed
to
have
come
and
arranged
to
go
out
there
with
him
by
bob
sleigh
a
rough
ride
of
six
or
seven
miles
brought
us
to
the
farm
and
we
began
our
quest
once
there
bailey
had
a
more
definite
idea
of
where
to
look
for
the
tree
from
which
these
particular
nuts
came
than
he
had
had
before
and
we
had
not
been
at
our
task
for
more
than
an
hour
before
it
was
located
there
were
still
quite
a
few
nuts
on
the
ground
beneath
it
which
identified
it
accurately
it
was
a
large
shagbark
whose
first
living
branch
was
fully
sixteen
feet
off
the
ground
and
since
we
had
no
ladder
with
us
i
had
to
shin
up
the
tree
to
cut
off
some
of
the
smaller
branches
this
shagbark
true
to
its
name
had
rough
bark
which
tore
not
only
my
clothes
but
some
of
the
skin
on
my
legs
as
well
and
whereas
the
climbing
up
was
difficult
the
coming
down
was
equally
so
having
contracted
verbally
with
fobes
to
buy
the
tree
i
packed
the
branches
i
had
cut
in
cardboard
boxes
with
straw
packing
and
carefully
brought
them
home
to
paul
i
wrote
at
once
to
my
friend
jones
of
my
expedition
telling
him
of
my
plans
to
propagate
this
hickory
i
also
sent
him
some
of
the
nuts
from
the
parent
tree
and
samples
of
nuts
from
other
trees
growing
near
it
so
that
he
could
give
me
his
opinion
of
them
jones
responded
by
advising
me
about
the
kind
of
a
contract
to
make
with
fobes
in
regard
to
both
the
purchasing
and
propagation
of
the
original
hickory
tree
and
he
urged
the
latter
enthusiastically
of
the
weschcke
hickory
nuts
themselves
he
wrote
this
is
practically
identical
with
the
glover
the
glover
is
usually
a
little
larger
but
this
varies
in
all
nuts
from
year
to
year
this
is
a
fine
nut
and
if
it
comes
from
iowa
it
ought
to
be
propagated
i
suggest
you
keep
the
stock
of
it
and
propagate
the
tree
for
northern
planting
that
is
for
iowa
minnesota
wisconsin
where
most
nuts
grown
here
would
not
mature
a
few
years
ago
i
saw
the
glover
hickory
nut
for
the
first
time
and
i
also
thought
it
much
the
same
as
the
weschcke
in
shape
as
is
also
the
brill
because
i
did
not
know
how
to
preserve
the
scions
i
had
cut
they
dried
out
during
the
winter
to
such
an
extent
that
they
were
worthless
for
spring
grafting
this
meant
losing
a
whole
season
the
next
fall
i
obtained
more
scionwood
from
fobes
and
having
kept
it
in
good
condition
during
the
winter
by
storing
it
in
a
harrington
graft
box
shown
by
illustration
i
was
able
to
graft
it
in
the
spring
however
these
grafts
did
not
take
hold
well
only
two
or
three
branches
resulting
from
all
of
it
and
these
did
not
bear
nor
even
grow
as
they
should
have
i
was
disappointed
and
discouraged
writing
to
fobes
that
i
did
not
believe
the
tree
could
be
propagated
illustration
drawing
illustrates
how
to
build
a
harrington
graft
storage
in
the
fall
of
fobes
sent
me
a
large
box
of
scions
and
branches
explaining
that
he
had
sold
his
farm
and
as
the
tree
might
be
cut
down
this
was
my
last
opportunity
to
propagate
it
without
much
enthusiasm
i
grafted
the
material
he
had
sent
me
on
about
a
dozen
trees
some
of
them
very
large
hickories
and
i
was
most
agreeably
surprised
to
find
the
grafting
successful
and
more
than
one
branch
bearing
nutlets
these
nuts
dropped
off
during
the
summer
until
only
one
remained
to
mature
which
it
did
in
the
latter
part
of
october
but
i
waited
too
long
to
pick
that
nut
and
some
smart
squirrel
which
had
probably
been
watching
it
ripen
as
diligently
as
i
had
secured
it
first
i
made
a
very
thorough
search
of
the
ground
nearby
to
find
the
remains
of
it
for
while
i
knew
i
would
not
get
a
taste
of
the
kernel
the
squirrel
would
take
care
of
that
i
was
interested
in
finding
out
whether
it
followed
the
exact
shape
and
thinness
of
shell
of
the
first
nuts
i
had
examined
i
finally
did
find
part
of
it
enough
to
see
that
it
was
similar
to
the
nuts
from
the
parent
tree
the
grafts
i
made
in
have
been
bearing
nuts
every
year
since
that
time
the
weschcke
hickory
makes
a
tremendous
growth
grafted
on
bitternut
hickory
carya
cordiformis
the
wood
and
buds
are
hardy
to
a
temperature
of
below
zero
fahrenheit
so
that
wherever
the
wild
bitternut
hickory
grow
this
grafted
tree
will
survive
to
bear
its
nuts
the
nuts
have
a
fine
flavor
and
the
unusual
quality
of
retaining
this
flavor
without
becoming
rancid
for
three
years
the
only
fault
to
find
with
them
is
the
commercial
one
of
being
only
medium
in
size
so
that
compared
to
english
walnuts
for
example
they
become
unimpressive
i
have
noticed
time
and
again
that
the
average
person
will
pass
over
a
small
sweet
nut
to
choose
a
larger
one
even
though
the
latter
may
not
have
as
attractive
a
flavor
this
is
noticeably
true
in
regard
to
pecans
when
the
large
types
which
have
a
rather
dry
sweet
kernel
are
almost
invariably
preferred
to
the
smaller
ones
of
finer
flavor
which
are
plump
and
have
slightly
thicker
shells
previous
to
finding
the
weschcke
hickory
i
experimented
with
several
varieties
of
hickory
hybrids
in
march
i
purchased
twelve
beaver
and
twelve
fairbanks
hybrid
hickories
from
jones
i
planted
these
trees
in
april
of
that
year
but
of
the
lot
only
two
beaver
trees
lived
to
bear
nuts
one
of
these
is
still
growing
on
my
farm
in
thin
clay
soil
underlaid
with
limestone
and
it
bears
nuts
annually
it
is
only
a
tree
but
i
think
its
slow
growth
has
protected
it
from
the
usual
amount
of
winter
damage
i
also
ordered
from
jones
in
july
marquardt
hiccans
laney
siers
beaver
and
fairbanks
the
last
four
are
hybrids
between
species
of
hickories
out
of
the
whole
order
amounting
to
one
hundred
trees
none
remains
alive
now
the
marquardt
hiccan
mentioned
above
was
the
subject
of
dispute
among
nut
culturists
for
a
time
but
it
has
been
definitely
agreed
now
that
the
marquardt
was
never
actually
propagated
the
tree
having
been
lost
or
cut
down
before
scions
were
taken
from
it
substitutes
were
taken
from
the
burlington
a
hybrid
whose
nut
is
similar
to
the
marquardt
and
whose
foliage
and
other
attributes
are
thought
to
be
like
it
the
name
of
marquardt
persisted
for
several
years
however
and
it
has
been
entirely
discarded
only
recently
the
burlington
is
now
known
to
be
the
representative
of
that
part
of
iowa
however
i
grafted
some
of
the
tops
of
the
marquardt
trees
from
jones
to
bitternut
trees
at
the
time
that
i
transplanted
them
several
of
the
grafts
made
successful
growth
and
resulted
in
several
trees
growing
deep
in
the
woods
after
years
these
grafts
are
still
alive
and
certainly
have
established
their
right
to
be
called
compatible
with
bitternut
hickory
stocks
close
examination
of
the
branches
leaves
and
buds
particularly
the
indicate
that
this
hiccan
is
enough
different
and
more
hardy
than
the
burlington
which
also
grows
well
on
the
bitternut
to
discredit
the
story
that
the
marquardt
is
lost
it
will
not
be
determined
however
that
this
is
the
genuine
marquardt
until
it
has
fruited
altogether
i
have
grafted
about
varieties
of
hickory
and
its
hybrids
on
bitternut
stocks
in
my
attempts
to
increase
the
number
of
varieties
of
cultured
hickory
trees
in
the
north
most
of
those
i
worked
with
were
compatible
with
the
bitternut
stock
but
a
few
perhaps
a
dozen
have
indicated
that
they
would
rather
not
live
on
the
bitternut
and
have
died
either
from
incompatibility
or
yet
as
a
root
system
the
bitternut
is
the
hardiest
and
easiest
to
transplant
of
any
of
the
hickories
and
for
these
reasons
it
makes
an
ideal
stock
for
the
amateur
to
use
i
did
try
in
to
grow
some
shagbark
hickory
stocks
which
would
be
more
compatible
with
those
varieties
i
could
not
get
started
on
bitternut
i
planted
half
a
bushel
of
shagbark
hickory
nuts
from
iowa
but
although
they
sprouted
nicely
they
were
not
sufficiently
hardy
and
were
so
severely
that
after
twelve
years
the
largest
was
not
more
than
a
foot
high
nor
thicker
than
a
lead
pencil
some
of
these
about
were
transplanted
into
the
orchard
and
in
other
favorable
locations
the
largest
of
these
in
is
about
inches
in
diameter
off
the
ground
and
about
feet
high
i
have
not
grafted
any
yet
and
only
one
has
borne
any
seedling
nuts
so
far
i
am
now
reconciled
to
using
my
native
bitternut
trees
for
most
of
my
stock
in
spite
of
some
disadvantages
a
list
of
successfully
grafted
varieties
is
appended
and
indicates
to
what
extent
this
stock
is
a
universal
root
stock
for
most
of
the
hickories
and
their
hybrids
a
successful
union
however
and
long
life
does
not
mean
that
good
bearing
habits
will
be
established
since
most
of
these
trees
grow
in
the
woods
in
dense
shade
and
poor
surroundings
some
varieties
have
not
borne
many
nuts
and
some
not
at
all
the
following
scions
were
cut

several

in

random
locations
some
having
been

and
later
also
there
is
a
sprinkling
of
bridgewater
variety
grafted
in
and
later
all
bearing
each
year
for
many
years
i
observed
hickories
and
walnuts
in
bloom
and
them
yet
i
overlooked
many
things
i
should
have
discovered
earlier
in
study
it
was
only
after
ten
years
of
observing
the
weschcke
hickory
for
example
that
i
realized
the
importance
of
proper
pollinization
of
it
in
years
when
it
produced
only
a
few
nuts
i
had
blamed
seasonal
factors
rains
and
soil
conditions
but
i
now
realize
that
it
was
due
to
lack
of
the
right
pollen
in
the
spring
of
i
decided
to
make
special
pollen
combinations
with
all
the
hickories
then
in
bloom
the
information
i
acquired
in
return
was
great
reward
for
the
work
i
did
i
selected
branches
of
the
weschcke
hickory
trees
bearing
a
profuse
amount
of
pistillate
female
blossoms
i
these
with
a
special
apparatus
the
gun
described
later
in
this
book
using
a
magnifying
glass
so
that
both
pollen
and
blossom
could
be
plainly
seen
in
doing
this
i
found
it
most
practical
to
wear
what
jewelers
call
a
double
loupe
a
light
fiber
carrying
lenses
to
such
work
i
treated
the
marked
branches
with
pollen
gathered
from
the
bridgewater
the
kirtland
and
the
beaver
all
very
good
i
also
pollinated
branches
of
the
cedar
rapids
variety
which
bears
little
pollen
in
this
locality
with
kirtland
pollen
however
the
pollinization
of
the
cedar
rapids
which
involved
treating
from
to
pistillate
blossoms
resulted
in
only
two
mature
nuts
the
weschcke
hickory
has
an
abortive
staminate
bloom
so
that
it
must
depend
on
some
other
variety
for
pollen
at
the
northern
nut
convention
held
at
hershey
in
where
i
had
the
honor
of
being
elected
president
of
that
venerable
organization
and
succeeded
myself
thereafter
for
the
next
five
years
i
mentioned
this
abortive
staminate
bloom
of
my
hickory
to
my
friend
mckay
associate
cytologist
of
the
department
of
agriculture
at
that
time
he
was
very
interested
in
this
phenomenon
and
wanted
specimens
of
the
abortive
catkins
for
examination
these
were
sent
to
him
in
the
spring
of
i
quote
from
mckay
report
on
his
primary
findings
i
have
just
made
a
preliminary
examination
of
the
catkins
from
your
hickory
tree
received
last
may
and
it
seems
that
the
individual
staminate
flower
of
the
catkin
produces
undersized
stamens
the
anthers
of
which
are
devoid
of
either
pollen
or
so
far
i
have
made
only
temporary
preparations
of
the
crushed
anthers
in
stain
but
careful
study
of
these
mounts
discloses
no
sign
of
pollen
grains
or
mother
cells
so
we
may
tentatively
conclude
that
no
pollen
is
produced
by
the
tree
in
other
words
it
is
the
stage
at
which
degeneration
of
the
tissue
occurs
in
the
anthers
and
its
nature
will
have
to
be
determined
by
means
of
a
longer
and
more
elaborate
technique
and
i
will
let
you
know
what
we
find
as
soon
as
the
results
are
available
it
may
be
that
are
not
even
formed
in
the
anthers
the
small
size
of
these
structures
and
their
more
or
less
shriveled
appearance
lead
me
to
believe
that
this
may
be
the
case
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
instance
among
nut
species
comparable
to
that
outlined
above
we
have
two
or
three
cases
of
male
sterility
in
chestnut
but
in
these
no
stamens
are
formed
in
the
individual
staminate
flower
in
one
of
the
hybrid
walnuts
that
i
reported
on
at
the
hershey
convention
imperfect
pollen
grains
are
formed
in
the
anthers
but
the
latter
structures
never
open
so
no
pollen
is
shed
bear
in
mind
that
the
above
report
is
preliminary
and
other
angles
may
turn
up
when
permanent
mounts
are
available
for
study
on
december
i
received
a
second
and
final
report
from
mckay
from
which
i
quote
as
follows
dear
weschcke
the
enclosed
pencil
sketches
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
results
obtained
from
sectioning
four
lots
of
material
from
the
two
samples
of
catkins
that
you
sent
two
lots
from
each
sample
since
the
sample
collected
may
at
the
time
of
catkin
fall
was
old
enough
to
contain
mature
pollen
and
showed
only
anthers
of
the
two
types
described
herewith
i
think
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
tree
is
male
sterile
because
of
the
failure
of
the
mother
cells
to
function
it
is
odd
that
in
some
anthers
the
develop
type
while
in
others
they
do
not
type
for
this
we
have
no
explanation
nor
can
we
explain
why
the
tree
is
male
sterile
i
am
afraid
these
phenomena
will
remain
a
matter
of
conjecture
for
some
time
to
come
since
sterilities
of
this
and
other
sorts
in
most
other
plants
are
largely
genetic
that
is
controlled
by
one
or
more
genes
that
are
inherited
in
mendelian
fashion
it
is
likely
that
such
is
the
case
here
you
and
i
will
not
live
long
enough
however
to
grow
the
necessary
number
of
generations
of
trees
to
clear
up
these
matters
in
the
course
of
routine
preparation
of
other
material
i
plan
to
run
up
other
lots
from
your
samples
and
i
will
let
you
know
if
anything
different
turns
up
i
believe
we
may
safely
conclude
however
that
the
results
reported
herewith
are
representative
in
further
explanation
mckay
submitted
the
drawings
shown
on
page
and
says
four
lots
of
material
were
sectioned
two
from
the
collection
of
may
and
two
from
that
of
may
of
these
two
gave
anthers
of
type
one
and
two
of
type
two
more
material
will
have
to
be
sectioned
before
we
know
which
type
is

the

of
type
one
are
greatly
shriveled
and
a
band
of
collapsed

apparently
represents
the
remains
of
archesporial
or

the

of

two
are
normal
in
appearance
but
the
degenerate

are
formed
a

of
the
degenerate
of
this

with
normal

below

this
substantiates
the
conclusion
that
i
had
arrived
at
previous
to
this
report
that
this
hickory
is
able
to
mature
its
nuts
early
in
the
fall
by
reason
of
not
having
to
waste
its
energy
in
the
production
of
pollen
there
is
only
one
other
variety
of
hickory
which
i
have
grafted
on
bitternut
which
has
proved
unable
to
mature
pollen
and
it
is
the
creager
from
iowa
i
was
immensely
pleased
to
find
that
it
responded
very
well
to
bridgewater
pollen
a
high
percentage
of
the
blooms
treated
with
it
developing
mature
nuts
the
results
with
the
kirtland
pollen
were
almost
equally
good
the
poorest
showing
coming
from
those
branches
treated
with
beaver
pollen

which
only
three
mature
nuts
developed

presumed
to
be
a

from
these

planted
in
the

i
found
of
these
nuts
had
sprouted
and
grown
into
small
trees
during
the
season
after
finding
the
most
suitable
pollen
for
the
weschcke
hickory
i
realized
the
necessity
for
including
more
than
one
variety
of
hickory
in
a
planting
just
as
there
should
be
more
than
one
variety
of
apple
or
plum
tree
in
an
orchard
i
think
that
it
would
always
be
well
to
have
three
or
more
varieties
of
known
compatibility
within
reasonable
distances
probably
not
more
than
feet
apart
nor
less
than
to
feet
for
large
hickories
of
the
many

of

and

like

hickory
tree
the
butternut
shares
in
the
childhood
reminiscences
of
those
who
have
lived
on
farms
or
in
the
country
where
butternuts
are
a
treat
to
look
forward
to
each
fall
the
nuts
which
mature
early
have
a
rich
tender
kernel
of
mild
flavor
only
the
disadvantage
of
their
heavy
corrugated
shells
prevents
them
from
holding
the
highest
place
in
popularity
although
a
good
variety
cracks
easily
into
whole
butternuts
grow
over
an
extended
range
which
makes
them
the
most
northern
of
all
our
native
wild
nut
trees
although
their
nuts
do
not
mature
as
far
north
as
hazelnuts
do
butternut
trees
blossom
so
early
that
in
northern
latitudes
the
blossoms
are
frequently
killed
in
late
spring
frosts
only
when
the
trees
are
growing
near
the
summit
of
a
steep
hillside
will
they
be
likely
to
escape
such
frosts
and
bear
crops
regularly
i
have
found
that
really
heavy
crops
appear
in
cycles
in
natural
groves
of
butternut
trees
my
observation
of
them
over
a
period
of
years
in
their
natural
habitat
in
wisconsin
has
led
me
to
conclude
that
one
may
expect
butternut
trees
to
bear
on
an
average
an
enormous
crop
of
nuts
once
in
five
years
a
fairly
large
crop
once
in
three
years
with
little
or
no
crop
the
remaining
years
as
a
seedling
tree
of
two
or
three
years
the
butternut
is
indistinguishable
from
the
black
walnut
except
to
a
very
discerning
and
practiced
eye
especially
in
the
autumn
after
its
leaves
have
fallen
as
the
trees
grow
older
the
difference
in
their
bark
becomes
more
apparent
that
of
the
butternut
remaining
smooth
for
many
years
as
contrasted
to
the
bark
on
black
walnut
trees
which
begins
to
roughen
on
the
main
trunk
early
in
its
life
bark
on
a
butternut
may
still
be
smooth
when
the
tree
is
ten
years
old
forest
seedlings
of
butternut
when
one
or
two
years
old
are
easily
transplanted
if
the
soil
is
congenial
to
their
growth
although
the
tree
will
do
well
on
many
types
of
soil
it
prefers
one
having
a
limestone
base
just
as
the
english
walnut
does
a
butternut
seedling
usually
requires
several
more
years
of
growth
than
a
black
walnut
does
before
it
comes
into
bearing
although
this
varies
with
climate
and
soil
it
is
impossible
to
be
exact
but
i
think
i
may
safely
say
that
it
requires
at
least
ten
years
of
growing
before
a
seedling
butternut
tree
will
bear
any
nuts
of
course
exceptions
will
occasionally
occur
as
a
butternut
tree
matures
it
spreads
out
much
like
an
apple
or
chestnut
tree
of
course
it
must
have
enough
room
to
do
so
an
important
factor
in
raising
any
nut
tree
enough
room
and
sunlight
hasten
and
insure
larger
crops
of
finer
nuts
grafting
valuable
varieties
of
butternut
on
black
walnut
stock
will
also
hasten
bearing
i
have
had
such
grafts
produce
nuts
the
same
year
the
grafting
was
done
and
these
trees
continued
to
grow
rapidly
and
produce
annually
however
they
were
not
easy
to
graft
the
stubborn
reluctance
of
the
butternut
top
to
accept
transplantation
to
a
foreign
stock
being
well
known
this
factor
will
probably
always
cause
grafted
butternut
trees
to
be
higher
in
price
than
black
walnut
or
hickory
the
reverse
graft
black
walnut
on
butternut
should
never
be
practiced
for
although
successful
the
black
walnut
overgrows
the
stock
and
results
in
an
unproductive
tree
specimens
or
more
years
old
prove
this
to
be
a
fact
butternut
trees
are
good
feeders
they
respond
well
to
cultivation
and
lend
themselves
to
being
grafted
upon
although
from
my
own
experience
i
question
their
usefulness
as
a
root
stock
i
have
found
that
when
i
grafted
black
walnuts
english
walnuts
or
heartnuts
on
butternut
stock
the
top
or
grafted
part
of
the
tree
became
barren
except
for
an
occasional
handful
of
nuts
even
on
very
large
trees
since
this
has
occurred
throughout
the
many
years
of
my
nut
culture
work
i
think
it
should
be
given
serious
consideration
before
butternut
is
used
as
a
root
stock
for
other
species
of
nut
trees

i
had
the
good
luck
to
discover
an
variety
of
butternut
in
river
falls
wisconsin
in
which
i
have
propagated
commercially
and
which
carries
my
name
a
nut
it
has
the
requisite
properties
for
giving
it
a
varietal
name
for
it
cracks
mostly
along
the
sutural
lines
and
its
internal
structure
is
so
shallow
that
the
kernel
will
fall
out
if
a
is
turned
upside
down
i
received
one
of
those
surprises
which
sometimes
occur
when
a
tree
is
asexually
propagated
when
i
grafted
scions
from
this
butternut
on
black
walnut
stock
the
resulting
nuts
were
larger
than
those
on
the
parent
tree
and
their
hulls
peeled
off
with
almost
no
effort
whether
these
features
continue
after
the
trees
become
older
is
something
i
shall
observe
with
interest

the
nearly
quality
of
these

makes
them
very
clean
to
handle
the
absence
of
hulls
in
cracking
butternuts
not
only
does
away
with
the
messiness
usually
involved
but
also
it
allows
more
accurate
cracking
and
more
sanitary
handling
of
the
kernels
in
i
noticed
a
new
type
of
butternut
growing
near
the
farm
residence
this
butternut
was
fully
twice
as
large
as
the
weschcke
and
had
eight
prominent
ridges
the
nut
proved
to
be
even
better
than
the
older
variety
and
we
intend
to
test
it
further
by
grafting
it
on
butternuts
and
black
walnut
stocks
although
nutcrackers
have
been
devised
to
crack
these
and
other
wild
nuts
they
are
not
as
fast
as
a
hammer
if
one
protects
the
hand
by
wearing
a
glove
and
stands
the
butternut
on
a
solid
iron
base
hitting
the
pointed
end
with
a
hammer
it
is
quite
possible
to
accumulate

in

the
butternut
tree
is
one
whose
lumber
may
be
put
to
many
uses
it
is
light
but
very
tough
and
stringy
and
when
planed
and
sanded
it
absorbs
varnish
and
finishes
very
well
although
not
as
dark
in
natural
color
as
black
walnut
butternut
resembles
it
in
grain
when
butternut
has
been
stained
to
represent
black
walnut
it
is
only
by
their
weight
that
they
can
be
distinguished
in
late
years
natural
butternut
has
become
popular
as
an
interior
finish
and
for
furniture
being
sold
as
blonde
walnut
french
walnut
or
white
walnut
in
my
opinion
very
improper
names
i
see
no
reason
for
calling
it
by
other
than
its
own
depletion
of
forests
of
butternut
trees
brings
its
lumber
value
up
in
price
nearly
to
that
of
fine
maple
or
birch
approaching
that
of
black
walnut
in
some
places
i
have
run
several
thousand
feet
of
butternut
lumber
from
my
farmland
through
my
own
sawmill
and
used
it
for
a
variety
of
purposes
it
is
probably
the
strongest
wood
for
its
weight
except
spruce
i
have
used
it
successfully
to
make
propellers
which
operate
electric
generators
for
deriving
power
from
the
wind
because
butternut
is
so
light
and
properly
varnished
resists
weathering
and
decay
to
so
great
an
extent
i
have
found
it
the
best
material
i
have
ever
tried
for
such
construction
in
building
a
small
electric
car
for
traveling
around
the
orchards
i
used
butternut
rather
than
oak
or
metal
which
saved
at
least
pounds
of
weight
an
important
matter
since
the
source
of
the
car
power
is
automobile
storage
batteries
butternut
is
very
durable
in
contact
with
the
ground
and
is
used
for
fence
posts
on
farms
where
it
is
plentiful
bird
houses
built
of
this
wood
will
last
indefinitely
even
a
lifetime
if
they
are
protected
with
paint
or
varnish
butternut
is
like
red
cedar
in
this
respect
although
much
stronger
stories
have
been
told
of
black
walnut
logs
which
after
lying
unused
for
fifty
years
have
been
sawed
into
lumber
and
found
to
be
still
in
excellent
condition
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
same
could
be
said
of
butternut
for
these
woods
are
very
much
alike
in
the
degree
of
their
durability
and
resistance
to
weather
an
incidental
value
butternut
trees
have
is
their
ability
to
bleed
freely
in
the
spring
if
the
outer
bark
is
cut
therefore
they
can
be
tapped
like
maple
trees
and
their
sap
boiled
down
to
make
a
sweet
syrup
it
does
not
have
the
sugar
content
that
the
stabler
black
walnut
has
however
another
possible
use
is
suggested
by
the
shells
of
butternuts
which
even
when
buried
in
the
ground
show
great
resistance
to
decay
i
have
found
them
to
be
still
intact
and
possessing
some
strength
after
being
covered
by
earth
for
fifteen
years
this
indicates
that
they
might
be
used

not
only
good
things
can
be
said
of
the
butternut
tree
and
it
would
be
wrong
to
avoid
mentioning
the
deleterious
effect
that
a
butternut
tree
may
have
on
other
trees
planted
within
the
radius
of
its
root
system
i
have
had
several
experiences
of
this
kind
one
butternut
tree
on
my
farm
having
a
trunk
six
inches
in
diameter
killed
every
mugho
pine
within
the
radius
of
its
root
system
this
amounted
to
between
and
pines
their
death
could
not
be
attributed
to
the
shade
cast
by
the
butternut
as
mugho
pines
are
very
tolerant
of
shade
as
the
first
branches
of
the
butternut
were
more
than
three
feet
off
the
ground
the
pines
could
not
have
been
influenced
by
the
top
system
of
the
tree
nor
do
i
believe
that
it
was
due
to
fallen
leaves
but
rather
directly
to
the
greatly
ramified
roots
large
evergreens
such
as
colorado
blue
spruce
native
white
pine
limber
pine
and
jeffrey
pine
are
known
to
have
been
similarly
influenced
while
small
butternut
trees
do
not
in
my
experience
have
this
effect
this
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
radius
of
their
root
systems
is
much
more
limited
most
plants
other
than
pines
thrive
within
the
influence
of
butternut
roots
however
and
it
certainly
does
not
damage
pasture
grass
as
some
of
the
country
best
grazing
land
is
among
such
trees
the
damage
results
from
a
chemical
known
as
juglone
which
is
elaborated
by
the
root
system
and
when
the
roots
of
the
butternut
cross
those
of
its
evergreen
neighbor
this
acts
as
a
poison
to
the
evergreen
and
may
kill
it

pioneering

in

the

of
the
northern

growers
association
at

new
york
in
brought
many
interesting
subjects
to
the
attention
of
nut
enthusiasts
none
however
commanded
as
much
attention
as
an
exhibit
by
paul
crath
of
toronto
of
walnuts
from
the
carpathian
mountains
in
europe
there
were
more
than
forty
varieties
of
walnuts
represented
in
it
in
sizes
ranging
from
that
of
a
large
filbert
to
that
of
a
very
large
hen
egg
and
in
shape
being
globular
ovate
or
rectangular
the
exhibitor
had
these
identified
by
varietal
numbers
until

should
suggest
appropriate
names

which
rev
crath
gave
during
the
convention
he
described
his
trips
and
findings
in
the
sections
of
the
polish
carpathians
the
subject
remained
in
prominence
during
the
three
days
of
the
convention
and
the
idea
was
suggested
that
the
association
sponsor
another
trip
to
europe
to
obtain
walnuts
growing
there
which
rev
crath
considered
even
hardier
and
finer
than
the
ones
he
had
the
plan
was
tabled
however
for
only
two
of
us
were
eager
to
contribute
to
the
venture
on
my
return
home
i
thought
more
about
what
a
splendid
opportunity
this
would
be
to
procure
hardy
english
walnuts
to
grow
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
interested
my
father
in
the
idea
and
with
his
backing
corresponded
with
rev
crath
this
was
not
the
first
or
the
last
time
that
my
father
charles
weschcke
had
encouraged
me
and
had
backed
his
good
wishes
and
advice
with
money
a
professional
man
and
a
graduate
of
pharmacy
and
chemistry
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
he
showed
an
unusual
interest
in
my
horticultural
endeavors
the
immediate
outcome
was
rev
crath
visit
to
my
nursery
at
river
falls
to
determine
whether
material
that
he
might
collect
could
be
properly
tested
there
to
my
satisfaction
he
found
that
temperature
soil
conditions
and
stock
material
were
adequate
for
such
work
we
contracted
with
rev
crath
to
reproduce
asexually
all
the
varieties
that
he
could
discover
and
ship
to
us
agreeing
to
finance
his
trip
and
to
pay
him
a
royalty
whenever
we
sold
trees
resulting
from
the
plant
material
he
sent
us
we
decided
that
the
material
which
he
was
to
gather
should
include
not
only
english
walnuts
but
also
the
hazels
or
filberts
native
to
poland
the
walnuts
were
to
consist
of
about
six
hundred
pounds
of
seeds
representing
some
forty
varieties
several
thousand
scions
and
about
five
hundred
trees
we
planned
that
the
filberts
should
consist
of
both
trees
and
nuts
but
because
of
a
total
failure
of
this
crop
the
year
that
rev
crath
was
there
only
trees
were
available
rev
crath
left
canada
in
october
and
spent
all
of
the
following
winter
in
poland
while
he
was
there
i
began
the
task
of
arranging
for
the
receipt
of
the
walnuts
and
hazels
he
was
to
send
and
so
began
a
wearisome
exasperating
experience
first
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
permits
from
the
bureau
of
plant
industry
in
washington
because
of
the
vast
quantity
of
material
expected
these
permits
had
to
be
issued
in
the
names
of
five
people
next
i
engaged
a
new
york
firm
of
importers
so
that
no
time
would
be
lost
in
the
shipment
to
the
proper
authorities
for
inspection
this
firm
in
turn
hired
brokers
who
were
responsible
for
paying
all
duty
freight
and
inspection
charges
i
certainly
thought
that
we
had
everything
in
such
readiness
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
delay
the
shipment
when
it
arrived
how
wrong
i
was
although
rev
crath
had
written
me
that
the
shipment
had
been
sent
on
a
certain
polish
steamer
i
learned
of
its
arrival
only
from
a
letter
i
received
from
the
importing
company
which
requested
that
the
original
bill
of
lading
and
invoice
be
sent
to
them
at
once
as
the
shipment
had
already
been
in
the
harbor
for
a
week
but
could
not
be
released
by
the
customs
office
until
they
had
these
documents
i
had
received
the
bill
of
lading
from
rev
crath
but
not
the
invoice
for
he
had
not
known
that
i
would
need
it
so
my
valuable
but
perishable
shipment
remained
in
port
storage
day
after
day
while
i
frantically
sought
for
some
way
to
break
through
the
red
tape
holding
it
there
cables
to
rev
crath
were
undeliverable
as
he
was
back
in
the
mountains
seeking
more
material
in
desperation
i
wrote
to
clarence
reed
an
old
friend
member
of
the
northern
nut
growers
association
and
in
charge
of
government
nut
investigations
in
the
division
of
pomology
at
washington
through
his
efforts
and
under
heavy
bond
pending
receipt
of
the
invoice
the
walnut
and
filbert
material
was
released
and
sent
to
washington
as
there
was
too
much
of
it
to
be
inspected
through
the
usual
facilities
for
this
work
it
was
necessary
to
employ
a
firm
of
seed
and
plant
importers
to
do
the
necessary
inspecting
and
fumigating
at
last
terminating
my
concern
and
distress
over
the
condition
in
which
the
trees
and
scions
would
be
after
such
great
delays
and
so
many
repackings
the
shipment
arrived
in
paul
there
remained
only
the
requirement
of
getting
permission
from
the
bureau
of
plant
inspection
of
the
state
of
minnesota
to
take
it
to
wisconsin
where
if
there
was
anything
left
i
intended
to
plant
it
this
permission
being
readily
granted
we
managed
by
truck
and
finally
by
sled
to
get
it
to
the
nursery
about
the
middle
of
the
winter
the
following
spring
we
planted
the
nuts
and
trees
and
grafted
the
scions
on
black
walnut
and
butternut
stocks
the
mortality
of
these
grafts
was
the
greatest
i
have
ever
known
of
about
four
thousand
english
walnut
grafts
representing
some
twenty
varieties
only
one
hundred
took
well
enough
to
produce
a
good
union
with
the
stock
and
to
grow
some
of
them
grew
too
fast
and
in
spite
of
my
precautions
were
blown
out
others
died
from
winter
injury
the
first
year
by
the
following
spring
there
were
only
ten
varieties
which
had
withstood
the
rigor
of
the
climate
of
the
five
hundred
trees
only
a
few
dozen
survived
fortunately
this
was
not
one
of
our
severe
test
winters
or
probably
none
of
these
plants
would
have
withstood
it
the
walnuts
which
were
planted
showed
a
fairly
high
degree
of
hardiness
of
seedling
trees
our
nursery
is
testing
more
than
for
varietal
classification
these
have
been
set
out
in
test
orchard
formation
on
two
locations
both
high
on
the
slope
of
a
ravine
one
group
on
the
north
side
one
on
the
south
it
has
been
suggested
that
from
the
remaining
seedlings
which
number
thousands
we
select
to
representative
specimens
and
propagate
them
on
black
walnut
stocks
in
some
warmer
climate
either
in
oregon
missouri
or
new
york
this
would
determine
their
value
as
trees
worthy
of
propagation
in
such
localities
such
an
experiment
will
probably
be
made
eventually
the
same
year
in
which
i
obtained
the
polish
nuts
i
also
bought
one
hundred
pounds
of
austrian
walnuts
to
serve
as
a
check
eighty
pounds
of
these
consisted
of
the
common
commercial
type
of
walnut
while
the
remainder
was
of
more
expensive
nuts
having
shells
and
recommended
by
the
austrian
seed
firm
as
particularly
hardy
altogether
these
nuts
included
approximately
one
hundred
varieties
twenty
of
which
were
so
distinctive
that
their
nuts
could
be
separated
from
the
others
by
size
and
shape
about
two
thousand
seedlings
grew
from
this
planting
most
of
which
proved
to
be
too
tender
for
our
winter
conditions
the
seedlings
grown
from
the
nuts
show
about
the
same
degree
of
hardiness
as
the
carpathian
plants
many
of
them
have
been
set
out
in
experimental
orchards
to
be
brought
into
bearing
after
the
first
year
the
english
walnuts
progressed
fairly
well
large
trees
which
had
not
been
entirely
worked
over
at
first
were
trimmed
so
that
nothing
remained
of
the
original
top
but
only
the
grafted
branches
the
winter
of
was
not
especially
severe
and
mortality
was
low
although
it
was
apparent
that
all
of
the
varieties
were
not
equally
hardy
even
a
few
of
the
scions
grafted
on
butternut
stocks
were
growing
successfully
i
had
made
these
grafts
realizing
that
the
stock
was
not
a
very
satisfactory
one
to
learn
if
it
could
be
used
to
produce
scionwood
as
the
results
were
encouraging
i
decided
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
give
them
good
care
and
gradually
to
remove
all
of
the
butternut
top
each
fall
the
first
two
years
after
i
had
grafted
all
these
walnuts
i
cut
and
stored
enough
scionwood
from
each
variety
to
maintain
it
if
the
winter
should
be
so
severe
as
to
destroy
the
grafts
unfortunately
the
grafts
had
developed
so
well
even
to
the
actual
bearing
of
nuts
by
three
varieties
that
in
i
did
not
think
this
precaution
was
necessary
then
came
our
catastrophic
armistice
day
blizzard
the
most
severe
test
of
hardiness
and
adaptability
ever
to
occur
in
the
north
many
of
our
hardiest
trees
suffered
great
injury
from
it
such
trees
for
instance
as
colorado
blue
spruce
limber
pine
arborvitae
cultured
varieties
of
hickories
hiccans
heartnuts
fruit
trees
including
apples
plums
and
apricots
which
bore
almost
no
fruit
the
next
summer
although
not
one
variety
of
english
walnut
was
entirely
killed
all
except
one
suffered
to
some
degree
and
it
was
not
until
late
the
following
summer
that
several
varieties
began
to
produce
new
wood
the
variety
which
showed
the
greatest
degree
of
hardiness
is
firstling
originally
known
as
letter
although
the
primary
buds
on
the
firstling
were
nearly
all
killed
very
few
of
the
small
branches
were
affected
and
the
union
itself
suffered
no
injury
second
in
hardiness
is
kremenetz
much
of
its
top
being
killed
but
its
union
being
only
slightly
affected
no
was
affected
in
about
the
same
amount
as
kremenetz
increasing
degrees
of
tenderness
and
of
course
decreasing
degrees
of
hardiness
were
shown
by
the
many
other
varieties
some
of
which
may
never
recover
completely
from
the
shock
of
that
blizzard
the
seedling
trees
suffered
only
slight
damage
so
that
i
expect
that
they
are
hardy
enough
to
produce
fruit
here
i
can
not
conclude
this
chapter
without
mentioning
certain
observations
i
have
made
regarding
hardiness
which
although
they
require
more
specific
study
i
wish
to
describe
as
a
suggestion
for
further
experimentation
by
either
amateur
or
professional
horticulturists
my
theory
is
that
a
determination
of
the
hardiness
factor
of
an
english
walnut
tree
can
be
made
according
to
the
color
of
its
bark
i
have
seen
that
a
tree
having
thin
bark
which
remains
bright
green
late
into
the
fall
is
very
likely
to
be
of
a
tender
variety
conversely
among
these
carpathian
walnuts
i
have
found
that
varieties
whose
bark
becomes
tan
or
brown
early
in
autumn
show
much
more
hardiness
than
those
whose
bark
remains
green
one
variety
wolhynie
whose
bark
is
chocolate
brown
is
very
resistant
to
winter
injury
another
whose
green
bark
is
heavily
dotted
with
lenticels
shows
itself
hardier
than
those
having
none
or
only
a
trace
of
them
in
testing
almonds
i
have
found
that
trees
whose
bark
turns
red
early
in
the
fall
are
definitely
more
hardy
than
those
whose
bark
remains
green
or
tan
in
observing
apricots
i
have
learned
that
young
twigs
with
red
bark
are
more
resistant
to
cold
than
those
with
brown
of
course
these
findings
can
not
be
considered
as
facts
until
further
studies
have
been
made
i
hope
that
others
will
find
the
idea
of
investigating
this
as
interesting
as
i
do
as
the
years
increased
however
the
growth
of
the
seedling
walnuts
decreased
and
some
having
made
a
nice
form
with
a
trunk
of
approximately
an
inch
in
diameter
within
a
succession
of
years
were
reduced
in
size
through
the
combination
of
winter
injury
and
attacks
by
the
butternut
curculio
as
well
as
a
bacterial
blight
until
by
only
a
fraction
of
the
seedlings
remained
certainly
less
than
all
of
the
originally
grafted
specimens
are
dead
with
the
exception
of
one
variety
which
has
been
kept
alive
by
constantly
it
on
black
walnut
we
have
not
named
this
variety
as
yet
although
it
has
borne
both
staminate
and
pistillate
bloom
it
has
never
borne
any
ripe
nuts
some
of
the
seedlings
however
still
show
persistent
traits
of
hardiness
and
of
insect
resistance
and
we
still
have
hopes
that
after
years
these
trees
will
yet
overcome
the
adversities
of
this
uncongenial
climate
for
this
species
chapter
other
trees
heartnut
the
heartnut
is
a
sport
of
the
japanese
walnut
juglans
sieboldiana
since
its
nut
is
it
has
the
name
of
cordiformis
added
to
its
species
name
there
are
many
of
these
sports
some
of
which
have
been
propagated
under
the
varietal
names
of
faust
lancaster
fodermaier
wright
walters
canoka
okay
and
gellatly
i
think
this
is
the
most
ornamental
of
all
nut
trees
in
shape
it
is
similar
to
an
apple
tree
spreading
out
rather
than
growing
tall
but
its
long
compound
leaves
give
it
a
tropical
appearance
during
the
autumn
these
leaves
do
not
color
any
more
than
do
those
of
the
black
walnut
the
tree
produces
long
racemes
of
red
blossoms
and
its
staminate
blooms
are
catkins
eight
to
ten
inches
long
which
when
fully
ripened
swish
in
the
wind
and
release
clouds
of
yellow
pollen
the
heartnut
tree
holds
the
interest
of
its
owner
closely
during
that
time
when
the
nuts
resulting
from
the
racemes
of
blossoms
are
steadily
increasing
in
size
i
have
seen
as
many
as
sixteen
nuts
on
one
stem
and
doubtless
there
sometimes
are
more
the
owner
of
such
a
tree
at
least
if
he
is
at
all
like
me
will
proudly
exhibit
it
to
all
comers
during
the
spring
and
summer
seasons
and
then
at
harvest
time
after
the
nuts
have
gradually
changed
from
green
to
the
dull
yellow
that
indicates
their
maturity
he
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
shaking
them
down
for
drying
and
storage
the
heartnut
kernel
tastes
much
like
that
of
the
butternut
and
its
internal
structure
is
almost
the
same
but
the
outside
shell
is
smooth
cultivated
varieties
usually
crack
easily
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
kernel
is
released
in
halves
from
all
this
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
heartnut
is
not
only
a
beautiful
tree
but
is
definitely
useful
in
my
own
work
with
heartnuts
i
have
found
that
although
they
are
to
be
classed
only
as
there
are
a
few
varieties
which
are
hardy
enough
for
northern
temperatures
only
testing
will
determine
which
ones
can
endure
severe
climates
in
the
spring
of
i
planted
a
lancaster
heartnut
grafted
on
a
black
walnut
but
the
weather
was
cold
that
season
and
it
was
killed
down
to
the
graft
joint
where
it
threw
out
a
sprout
this
was
weak
and
succulent
by
fall
and
the
graft
was
entirely
killed
back
that
winter
i
bought
twelve
more
lancaster
heartnuts
a
year
later
they
were
interspersed
in
the
orchard
among
some
black
walnuts
although
a
few
survived
the
first
winter
none
ever
lived
to
come
into
bearing
from
time
to
time
i
also
experimented
with
seedlings
sent
to
me
by
professor
james
neilson
of
vineland
ontario
who
was
interested
in
having
them
tested
in
this
latitude
these
too
were
always
unsuccessful
i
had
my
first
success
with
several
unnamed
varieties
of
heartnuts
i
purchased
in
from
gellatly
of
british
columbia
these
were
grafted
on
black
walnut
stocks
of
considerable
size
to
insure
their
surviving
the
first
winter
i
built
wooden
shelters
which
completely
enclosed
them
filling
these
shelters
with
forest
leaves
and
protecting
them
against
mice
with
screen
covers
no
doubt
this
was
a
decided
help
at
least
all
of
these
heartnuts
lived
for
many
years
until
the
invasion
of
the
butternut
curculio
and
the
damage
done
by
the
yellow
bellied
sap
sucker
bird
caused
me
the
loss
of
all
except
one
variety
the
gellatly
this
variety
i
have
perpetuated
by
on
other
black
walnut
stocks
and
by
spraying
and
covering
the
limbs
with
screen
to
prevent
the
sap
sucker
from
working
on
it
still
have
it
in
the
nursery
and
at
my
home
in
paul
where
a
young
tree
on
the
boulevard
bears
each
year
i
have
found
that
heartnuts
are
difficult
to
propagate
the
number
of
successful
grafts
i
have
made
being
far
below
that
of
black
walnuts
on
black
walnut
stocks
the
reason
for
this
is
not
well
understood
any
more
than
is
the
fact
in
my
experience
that
the
stabler
walnut
will
graft
readily
and
the
ten
eyck
persistently
refuses
to
a
good
feature
that
these
grafted
trees
do
have
however
is
their
early
productiveness
i
have
seen
them
set
nuts
the
second
year
after
grafting
and
this
has
also
occurred
in
trees
i
have
sold
to
others
when
a
nut
of
sieboldiana
cordiformis
is
planted
it
does
not
reliably
reproduce
itself
in
true
type
sometimes
reverting
to
that
of
the
ordinary
japanese
walnut
which
looks
more
like
a
butternut
and
has
a
rather
rough
shell
as
distinguished
from
the
smooth
shell
of
the
heartnut
in
hulling
my
heartnut
crop
for
i
noticed
many
deformed
nuts
the
season
had
been
a
prolific
one
for
nut
production
of
all
kinds
and
i
knew
there
had
been
a
mixture
of
pollen
in
the
air
at
the
time
these
nutlets
were
receptive
a
mixture
made
up
largely
of
pollen
from
black
walnuts
butternuts
with
some
english
walnuts
since
irregularities
in
size
and
shape
indicate
hybridity
frequently
and
since
heartnuts
are
easily
hybridized
i
have
assumed
that
these
were
pollinized
by
the
mixture
i
have
planted
these
nuts
and
i
expect
them
to
result
in
many
new
crosses
of
sieboldiana
cordiformis
some
five
to
eight
years
from
now

show
how
nature
reacts
to
much
interference
i
will
follow
through
on
these
nearly
small
trees
that
resulted
from
this
pollination
they
were
transplanted
into
an
orchard
on
a
side
hill
and
well
taken
care
of
for
several
years
but
during
that
time
one
after
another
was
killed
apparently
by
winter
conditions
or
perhaps
the
site
was
too
exposed
or
the
soil
may
have
been
uncongenial
today
there
remains
but
three
trees
none
of
which
have
borne
but
all
indicate
that
they
are
true
heartnuts
from
the
shape
of
the
leaves
and
color
of
the
bark
and
general
formation
in
order
to
hasten
their
bearing
scions
have
been
taken
from
these
small
trees
and
will
be
grafted
on
large
black
walnut
stocks
to
bring
them
into
fruitfulness
much
earlier
than
if
they
were
left
to
their
own
slow
growth
this
system
of
testing
out
seedlings
long
before
they
have
reached
a
size
sufficient
to
bear
on
their
own
roots
is
applicable
to
all
of
the
species
of
nut
trees
and
is
one
way
that
the
plant
breeder
can
hurry
up
his
testing
for
varieties
after
making
crosses
and
obtaining
young
plants

the
beechnut
fagus
ferruginea
belonging
to
the
oak
family
is
one
of
the
giants
of
the
forest
growing
to
great
size
and
age
even
very
old
beech
trees
have
smooth
bark
and
this
in
earlier
and
more
rustic
days
was
much
used
for
the
romantic
carving
of
lovers
names
as
scars
still
visible
on
such
ancient
trees
testify
the
wood
itself
is
dense
and
hard
even
more
so
than
hard
maple
and
is
considered
good
lumber
beechnut
is
one
of
the
few
nut
trees
with
a
more
shallow
and
ramified
root
system
as
contrasted
with
that
of
most
which
as
in
the
oak
walnut
and
hickory
is
a
tap
root
system
this
fact
suggests
that
in
those
localities
where
beeches
grow
wild
grafts
made
on
such
trees
and
transplanted
would
survive
and
grow
well
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
very
little
propagation
is
done
with
beeches
is
that
no
outstanding
variety
has
ever
been
discovered
although
the
nut
shell
is
thin
and
the
meat
sweet
and
oily
the
kernel
is
so
small
that
one
must
crack
dozens
of
them
to
get
a
satisfying
sample
of
their
flavor
this
of
course
prevents
their
having
any
commercial
value
as
a
nut
there
is
also
the
fact
that
the
beechnut
is
the
slowest
growing
of
all
the
common
nut
trees
requiring
from
twenty
to
thirty
years
to
come
into
bearing
as
a
seedling
of
course
this
could
be
shortened
just
as
it
is
in
propagating
hickories
and
pecans
by
making
grafts
on
root
systems
which
are
ten
or
more
years
old
as
explained
in
the
chapter
on
heartnuts
however
i
know
of
no
nursery
in
which
beechnuts
are
propagated
in
this
way
my
attempts
to
grow
beechnut
trees
in
wisconsin
have
met
with
little
success
about
the
year
i
obtained
trees
from
the
sturgeon
bay
nurseries
i
planted
these
on
level
ground
which
had
clay
near
the
surface
with
limestone
about
a
foot
under
it
although
all
of
these
trees
seemed
to
start
satisfactorily
some
even
growing
about
a
foot
within
two
or
three
years
they
had
all
died
i
decided
they
were
not
hardy
but
i
now
realize
that
the
character
of
the
soil
was
responsible
for
their
gradual
death
they
should
be
planted
in
a
limestone
or
calcareous
soil
preferably
of
the
fine
sandy
type
the
main
requisite
being
plenty
of
moisture
because
of
their
shallow
root
system
since
then
i
have
purchased
beechnut
seeds
several
times
from
various
seedsmen
but
none
of
these
seeds
has
ever
sprouted
i
think
this
is
because
beechnuts
like
chestnuts
must
be
handled
with
great
care
to
retain
their
viability
in
i
ordered
beechnut
trees
from
the
hershey
nurseries
of
downingtown
pennsylvania
although
these
trees
were
set
in
sandy
soil
there
are
now
only
about
five
of
them
alive
and
of
these
only
four
are
growing
well
enough
to
suggest
that
they
will
some
day
become
big
trees
beechnuts
must
be
protected
against
mice
and
rabbits
as
these
species
of
rodents
are
very
fond
of
bark
and
young
growth
of
these
trees
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
deer
are
in
the
same
category
oaks
although
the
acorns
produced
by
the
red
oak
are
very
bitter
and
consistently
wormy
those
from
the
white
oak
are
more
edible
in
my
own
exploring
i
have
found
one
tree
apparently
a
hybrid
between
the
red
and
white
oaks
which
bears
good
acorns
the
nuts
which
are
long
and
thin
are
generally
infested
with
weevils
if
there
were
a
demand
for
such
a
nut
tree
i
sure
that
it
could
easily
be
grafted
on
oak
roots
during
favorable
seasons
when
these
edible
nuts
were
of
good
size
and
free
from
worms
i
have
carried
them
in
my
pocket
and
enjoyed
munching
on
them
i
found
that
their
flavor
like
that
of
chestnuts
was
improved
by
roasting
acorns
are
a
balanced
food
and
contain
enough
starch
to
make
them
readily
assimilated
except
for
their
bitterness
they
are
a
good
food
for
farm
animals
and
chickens
i
have
kept
a
flock
of
goats
in
good
condition
by
feeding
them
acorns
during
the
winter
it
is
necessary
to
grind
them
for
such
use
i
have
read
that
indians
at
one
time
prepared
acorns
for
their
own
use
by
storing
them
in
bags
submerged
in
cold
running
water
this
not
only
extracted
the
bitterness
but
also
it
probably
discouraged
the
development
of
weevil
eggs
oak
trees
are
generally
prolific
and
are
regular
bearers
but
of
course
what
they
are
widely
known
and
loved
for
is
the
beauty
of
their
leaves
in
the
autumn
no
one
doubts
their
esthetic
value
which
will
keep
them
forever
popular
whether
they
come
into
demand
as
a
grafted
nut
tree
or
not
chestnuts
another
of
our
ornamental
nut
trees
is
the
chestnut
also
of
the
oak
family
classified
under
the
genus
castanea
which
grows
into
a
large
beautiful
tree
with
branches
chestnuts
do
not
grow
well
on
limestone
soil
and
always
fail
in
the
heavy
blue
clay
so
common
on
farm
lands
in
this
part
of
the
country
it
is
best
for
their
growth
that
the
soil
be
gravelly
and
slightly
acid
the
chestnut
has
always
been
a
good
timber
tree
its
wood
although
not
as
hard
as
the
red
oak
resembles
it
in
grain
the
beams
of
many
old
pioneer
homes
are
found
to
be
chestnut
it
is
said
that
this
is
one
of
few
woods
to
give
a
warning
groan
under
too
heavy
a
burden
before
it
cracks
or
breaks
chestnut
wood
is
very
durable
in
contact
with
the
soil
outlasting
all
others
except
possibly
black
walnut
and
cedar
it
contains
so
much
siliceous
matter
in
its
pores
that
it
quickly
dulls
chisels
and
saws
used
in
working
it
the
chestnut
trees
at
my
nursery
were
grown
from
mixed
hybrid
seeds
which
i
obtained
from
miss
amelia
riehl
of
godfrey
illinois
almost
all
of
the
seeds
she
first
sent
me
in
spoiled
while
they
were
stored
during
the
winter
but
miss
riehl
sent
me
more
the
following
spring
many
of
which
proved
hardy
in
the
oldest
of
these
trees
produced
staminate
bloom
for
the
first
time
i
naturally
expected
a
crop
of
nuts
from
it
that
year
but
none
developed
the
same
thing
happened
in
i
then
wrote
to
miss
riehl
about
it
also
asking
her
where
to
look
for
the
pistillate
blossoms
her
reply
was
a
very
encouraging
one
in
which
she
wrote
that
the
pistillate
blossoms
appear
at
the
base
of
the
catkins
or
staminate
blooms
but
that
it
is
quite
a
common
thing
for
chestnut
trees
to
carry
the
latter
for
several
years
before
producing
pistillate
blossoms
she
also
explained
that
it
was
very
unlikely
that
the
tree
would
fertilize
its
own
blooms
so
that
i
should
not
expect
one
tree
to
bear
until
other
nearby
chestnuts
were
also
shedding
pollen
this
occurred
the
next
year
and
another
chestnut
close
to
the
first
one
set
a
few
nuts
it
was
not
until
that
the
tree
which
had
blossomed
first
actually
bore
nuts
in
i
crossed
the
pistillate
blossoms
of
this
tree
with
pollen
from
a
chinese
variety
called
carr
resulting
in
half
a
dozen
nuts
which
i
planted
since
the
chestnuts
in
these
parts
do
not
bloom
usually
until
early
july
we
can
expect
chestnuts
to
be
a
more
reliable
crop
than
butternuts
for
instance
which
bloom
very
early
in
the
spring
about
may
to
having
had
this
reward
for
my
efforts
i
took
much
more
interest
in
chestnut
growing
and
ordered
trees
of
the
chinese
varieties
castanea
mollissma
from
russell
smith
stoke
and
john
hershey
some
of
these
were
seedlings
and
some
were
grafted
trees
not
over
a
dozen
of
them
alive
today
and
none
have
produced
mature
nuts
seemingly
they
have
not
been
hardy
although
they
have
grown
large
enough
to
produce
both
staminate
and
pistillate
blooms
they
have
never
winter
killed
back
to
the
ground
however
also
i
have
been
planting
nuts
from
all
sources
from
which
i
could
obtain
them
mostly
of
the
chinese
chestnut
type
some
of
these
nuts
were
results
of
crosses
and
showed
their
hybridity
in
the
young
seedlings
that
resulted
there
from
today
i
have
perhaps
of
such
young
seedlings
which
i
am
pampering
with
the
hope
of
getting
something
worthwhile
from
them
one
of
the
big
thrills
of
chestnut
growing
was
the
result
of
a
chestnut
that
i
picked
up
from
a
plant
that
was
no
higher
than
feet
growing
at
beltsville
maryland
in
the
government
testing
ground
there
in
my
records
show
that
this
plant
began
to
bear
nuts
in
and
have
subsequently
borne
several
crops
in
between
the
times
that
it
was
frozen
to
the
ground
and
grew
up
again
which
happened
at
least
three
times
like
most
chestnuts
this
one
has
to
be
pollinated
by
taking
the
staminate
bloom
from
a
dwarfed
chestnut
nearby
whose
bloom
coincides
with
the
blossoming
of
the
female
flowers
of
this
chinese
hybrid
chestnuts
rarely
set
any
nuts
that
produce
mature
seed
from
their
own
pollen
but
depend
on
the
nut
from
this
hybrid
is
also
the
largest
of
any
that
i
have
grown
and
to
my
taste
is
a
palatable
one
it
may
not
rank
among
the
best
ones
of
known
varieties
today
but
for
our
climate
i
would
consider
it
unusually
large
and
good
experimentally
i
have
been
able
to
produce
new
plants
from
this
tree
by
layering
young
shoots
coming
from
the
roots
this
generally
requires
two
years
to
make
a
plant
before
they
are
cut
off
and
transplanted
this
alternative
of
propagating
by
grafting
or
budding
is
considered
a
better
method
if
it
can
be
practiced
as
it
gives
a
plant
on
its
own
roots
instead
of
the
roots
of
some
unknown
seedling
stock

that
surprised
me
when
it
came
into
bearing
proved
to
bear
one
nut
in
a
burr
which
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
a
chinquapin
hybrid
later
on
the
habit
of
this
tree
changed
somewhat
and
some
of
the
burrs
had
more
than
one
nut
i
have
found
this
to
be
the
experience
of
others
who
have
observed
chinquapin
trees
of
a
hybrid
nature
it
is
my
belief
that
the
kind
of
pollen
with
which
these
blossoms
are
fertilized
directly
influences
the
number
of
nuts
in
a
burr
and
sometimes
the
size
of
the
nuts
again
showing
the
importance
of
the
varieties
when
setting
out
an
orchard
of
trees
this
particular
chinquapin
type
chestnut
has
upright
growing
habits
different
from
a
tree
bearing
similar
nuts
but
having
a
very
dwarfed
habit
all
of
the
nuts
of
the
latter
after
six
years
of
bearing
can
be
picked
off
this
tree
by
standing
on
the
ground
there
are
several
other
trees
bearing
chestnuts
some
large
and
some
small
nuts
all
of
which
are
interesting
to
me
and
may
be
important
in
the
future
of
the
chestnuts
this
far
north
since
they
indicate
without
doubt
that
the
chestnut
can
accommodate
itself
to
our
climate
providing
it
has
the
right
type
of
soil
to
grow
in
in
i
acquired
a
adjoining
piece
of
land
which
has
a
much
better
chestnut
growing
site
being
deep
sandy
soil
well
drained
and
yet
not
ever
being
dry
new
varieties
will
be
tested
on
this
piece
and
should
give
much
better
results
than
the
old
trees
which
already
were
good
enough
to
indicate
success

chestnuts

if
it
were
not
that
an
apricot
is
a
nut
as
well
as
a
fruit
i
should
hesitate
to
include
a
description
of
my
work
with
it
but
the
apricot
seed
has
a
rich
kernel
which
in
many
countries
for
example
china
is
used
as
a
substitute
for
the
almond
to
which
it
is
closely
related
it
was
in
that
my
aunt
margaret
weschcke
told
me
of
an
apricot
tree
growing
in
a
yard
on
the
mississippi
river
bluff
in
paul
and
said
to
be
bearing
fruit
i
was
quite
skeptical
until
i
saw
the
tree
and
also
saw
fruit
from
it
which
had
been
preserved
by
the
woman
who
owned
it
convinced
of
the
hardiness
of
the
tree
i
was
anxious
to
obtain
scionwood
but
it
was
not
until
late
that
winter
that
i
received
permission
to
do
so
it
happened
that
a
truck
had
broken
off
a
large
branch
from
the
tree
while
delivering
coal
and
the
owner
very
reasonably
decided
that
taking
a
few
twigs
from
it
would
not
hurt
it
any
more
i
not
only
took
the
small
branches
that
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
from
her
tree
but
also
as
many
as
possible
from
the
branch
which
had
been
torn
off
as
its
terminals
were
still
in
a
fresh
condition
i
grafted
these
scions
on
hybrid
plum
trees
where
they
took
hold
readily
and
in
they
began
to
bear
prolifically
the
apricots
which
i
have
named
harriet
in
honor
of
my
mother
are
a
fruit
medium
in
size
their
cheeks
are
a
mottled
red
with
raised
surfaces
their
pits
are
and
fairly
edible
although
the
parent
tree
died
the
winter
i
took
scions
from
it
my
grafts
have
proved
quite
hardy
having
received
no
injury
when
temperatures
as
low
as
below
zero
have
occurred
since
the
parent
tree
died
because
its
roots
were
severely
frozen
it
would
seem
that
the
top
of
the
tree
in
this
case
was
more
hardy
than
the
root
system
this
does
occur
sometimes
although
it
is
unusual
in
developing
the
factor
of
hardiness
further
in
this
apricot
variety
i
have
taken
advantage
of
something
i
had
observed
about
other
fruit
trees
when
one
combines
parts
of
two
trees
by
grafting
it
is
a
simple
thing
to
select
a
hardy
root
stock
from
the
available
plants
just
as
i
selected
hardy
plum
stock
on
which
to
graft
my
apricot
scions
this
is
not
always
possible
in
choosing
scionwood
however
since
scionwood
is
usually
selected
for
such
reasons
as
the
quality
of
its
fruit
it
may
happen
that
the
top
part
of
a
tree
is
limited
in
its
climatic
scope
because
of
its
inability
to
withstand
precipitate
or
otherwise
unfavorable
temperatures
having
observed
that
certain
grafted
varieties
of
fruit
trees
such
as
the
wealthy
apple
for
instance
have
gradually
come
to
be
planted
much
farther
north
than
they
originally
were
i
reasoned
that
this
was
because
only
the
hardiest
of
them
survived
and
these
hardy
ones
therefore
became
the
mother
blocks
for
future
grafting
this
was
an
inescapable
procedure
which
acted
as
a
method
of
bud
selection
i
therefore
assumed
that
by
a
careful
choice
of
the
hardiest
among
surviving
twigs
of
the
most
recent
graft
of
the
harriet
apricot
when
particularly
severe
winter
weather
had
caused
some
injury
i
could
induce
in
future
grafts
i
also
believe
that
i
have
added
to
the
hardiness
factor
of
the
apricot
by
making
frequent
grafts
it
is
my
theory
that
the
root
stock
is
able
to
exert
some
influence
over
the
top
other
than
mere
maintenance
of
life
by
frequently
uniting
a
hardy
stock
with
a
less
hardy
top
i
think
that
the
individuality
of
the
top
part
may
be
somewhat
broken
down
and
the
extra
characteristic
of
hardiness
added
to
it
after
the
fifth
of
this
apricot
made
in
eight
years
i
am
convinced
by
its
appearance
and
behavior
that
it
is
capable
of
becoming
a
reliable
apricot
for
the
region
around
paul
today
the
apricot
still
exists
grafted
on
plum
at
my
nursery
at
river
falls
wisconsin
and
the
weakness
of
the
tree
seems
to
be
in
the
union
between
the
top
and
the
plum
stock
if
this
union
were
not
so
corky
and
large
and
succulent
it
might
be
less
injured
by
our
winters
therefore
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
plum
is
not
a
congenial
stock
for
an
apricot
at
least
it
does
not
produce
a
satisfactory
union
i
am
now
making
tests
with
this
same
variety
by
grafting
it
on
more
hardy
apricot
seedling
stock
such
as
the
hansen
of

introduces
chapter
pests
and
pets
the
pocket
gopher
is
an
herbivorous
animal
which
attains
approximately
the
size
of
a
gray
squirrel
it
has
a
sleek
coat
of
fur
which
is
almost
as
fine
as
that
of
the
mole
and
would
i
think
make
a
good
quality
fur
except
that
the
skin
is
too
tender
to
stand
either
sewing
or
the
wear
that
fur
coats
have
to
undergo
i
learned
this
by
trapping
them
and
having
a
furrier
try
them
out
as
i
knew
that
the
quickest
way
to
get
rid
of
a
pest
is
to
eat
it
or
use
its
hide
since
i
found
its
hide
to
be
of
no
practical
value
i
enjoined
my
troop
of
boy
scouts
a
willing
group
of
boys
to
carry
out
my
suggestions
that
they
skin
and
prepare
one
of
these
animals
in
a
stew
gophers
are
purely
herbivorous
and
i
thought
they
should
be
quite
edible
but
as
i
am
a
strict
vegetarian
myself
i
had
to
depend
on
them
to
make
this
experiment
the
boys
followed
instructions
up
to
the
point
of
cooking
but
by
that
time
the
appearance
of
the
animal
had
so
deprived
them
of
their
enthusiasm
and
appetites
that
i
had
no
heart
to
urge
them
to
continue
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
however
that
to
people
the
pocket
gopher
would
taste
as
good
as
squirrel
or
pigeon
the
first
introduction
i
had
to
the
devastating
work
that
these
animals
can
do
in
an
orchard
was
when
i
was
working
among
my
young
apple
and
plum
trees
one
spring
i
noticed
that
the
foliage
was
turning
yellow
on
many
of
them
and
upon
investigation
i
found
that
the
trees
were
very
loose
in
the
ground
at
first
i
thought
that
planting
operations
and
heaving
of
the
ground
by
frost
in
the
spring
might
be
the
cause
but
in
testing
the
looseness
of
one
of
these
trees
i
found
that
i
could
pull
it
out
of
the
ground
easily
there
i
saw
what
appeared
to
be
the
marks
of
an
axe
i
was
completely
convinced
that
i
had
personal
enemies
who
went
around
nights
chopping
off
the
roots
of
my
trees
for
i
knew
that
most
of
my
neighbors
were
completely
out
of
sympathy
with
my
tree
cultivation
in
fact
farmers
living
in
that
section
of
the
country
were
always
poking
fun
at
my
nut
tree
plantings
and
orchard
work
for
their
idea
of
what
was
proper
on
a
farm
was
a
treeless
field
of
plowed
ground
as
i
thought
of
all
these
things
i
pulled
up
many
other
trees
in
fact
there
were
dozens
that
were
chopped
off
so
that
they
could
be
completely
pulled
out
others
still
had
one
or
two
roots
clinging
to
the
main
trunk
and
these
i
carefully
replanted
so
that
they
would
continue
to
live
and
grow
not
long
after
the
tragic
day
on
which
i
found
all
these
ravaged
trees
i
noticed
winding
in
and
out
close
to
the
young
orchard
trees
the
mounds
which
pocket
gophers
make
when
they
tunnel
under
the
ground
i
followed
some
of
these
by
digging
into
them
with
a
shovel
and
discovered
that
they
led
to
the
roots
of
trees
the
very
trees
that
had
been
chopped
off
and
killed
my
enemies
were
not
human
after
all
sending
for
a
pamphlet
from
the
department
of
agriculture
i
studied
the
material
given
about
pocket
gophers
and
their
habits
i
then
began
their
systematic
eradication
using
about
twelve
steel
muskrat
traps
i
succeeded
in
trapping
in
one
season
over
thirty
of
them
at
a
time
when
they
were
so
prolific
and
their
holes
so
numerous
that
i
could
not
drive
a
horse
through
the
orchard
without
danger
of
breaking
one
of
its
legs
i
also
used
poisoned
grains
and
gases
but
i
do
not
recommend
them
trapping
is
the
only
method
in
which
one
obtains
actual
evidence
of
elimination
it
took
me
many
years
to
force
the
gophers
out
of
my
orchards
and
i
still
must
set
traps
every
fall
during
september
and
october
when
they
are
most
active
their
habits
are
such
that
they
do
most
of
their
tunnelling
in
the
early
fall
months
before
frost
during
which
time
they
expose
and
isolate
the
roots
on
which
they
intend
to
feed
during
the
winter
months
when
the
ground
is
so
hard
that
they
can
not
burrow
further
this
period
is
when
they
are
most
easily
trapped
it
was
with
the
idea
of
establishing
a
balance
of
nature
against
these
animals
that
i
conceived
the
idea
of
importing
bull
snakes
almost
everyone
has
heard
of
the
bull
snake
but
its
name
is
a
poor
one
for
it
has
the
wrong
connotation
these
snakes
are
actually
a
fine
friend
to
the
farmer
since
each
snake
accounts
for
the
death
of
many
rodents
each
year
their
presence
certainly
was
of
definite
value
in
decreasing
the
number
at
my
farm
bull
snakes
have
the
long
body
typical
of
constrictors
sometimes
reaching
a
length
of
nearly
six
feet
at
maturity
and
being
at
the
most
an
inch
and
in
diameter
this
country
had
a
natural
abundance
of
such
snakes
at
one
time
but
ignorance
and
superstition
have
lessened
their
number
so
that
it
is
now
a
rare
thing
to
find
one
during
the
early
days
of
automobiles
these
huge
bull
snakes
or
gopher
snakes
as
i
prefer
to
call
them
would
lie
across
the
sunny
dusty
roads
and
drivers
of
cars
delighted
in
running
them
down
since
they
are
very
docile
they
are
the
least
afraid
of
man
of
any
members
of
the
local
snake
family
they
are
slow
in
movement
until
they
sense
the
immediate
presence
of
their
natural
food
which
is
live
mice
rats
gophers
squirrels
young
rabbits
and
sometimes
though
rarely
birds
then
it
is
they
become
alert
and
the
horny
appendage
on
their
tails
vibrates
with
a
buzzing
sound
simulating
although
not
similar
to
the
sound
of
a
poisonous
rattlesnake
when
i
first
brought
some
of
these
snakes
to
my
farm
i
loosed
them
and
they
wandered
off
to
a
neighbor
premises
where
they
were
promptly
found
and
killed
later
importations
i
confined
to
my
basement
where
i
built
an
artificial
pool
with
frogs
and
fish
in
it
however
i
could
never
induce
the
bull
snakes
to
eat
any
of
these
batrachians
they
would
almost
playfully
stalk
the
frogs
but
at
the
moment
when
one
was
within
reach
the
snake
would
glide
away
neither
would
the
snakes
unless
eat
anything
they
had
not
caught
themselves
my
children
were
delighted
to
have
the
snakes
there
and
made
pets
of
them
only
once
was
one
of
the
girls
bitten
when
she
attempted
the
bite
was
a
mere
scratch
but
we
feared
that
it
might
be
slightly
poisonous
however
it
healed
so
promptly
that
it
was
quite
apparent
that
the
bull
snake
bite
is
not
toxic
i
too
have
had
my
skin
slightly
punctured
by
their
teeth
but
always
the
wound
healed
with
no
more
pain
or
trouble
than
a
pin
prick
such
is
not
at
all
the
case
when
a
person
is
nipped
by
a
squirrel
or
gopher
i
have
purposely
allowed
a
pocket
gopher
to
bite
me
to
determine
what
the
effects
are
the
pain
was
severe
and
healing
was
slow
once
bitten
by
a
gray
squirrel
when
i
reached
into
a
hollow
tree
to
get
it
i
received
such
a
wound
that
fever
started
in
my
whole
hand
its
teeth
punctured
a
and
were
stopped
only
by
meeting
the
bone
such
bites
i
consider
rather
poisonous
rabbits
also
committed
much
damage
at
my
nursery
by
gnawing
the
bark
of
my
trees
especially
during
times
of
deep
snow
they
did
not
bother
the
walnuts
particularly
but
were
very
fond
of
hickories
and
pecan
trees
on
the
smallest
ones
they
cut
branches
off
and
carried
them
away
to
their
nests
on
larger
trees
they
gnawed
the
bark
off
of
most
of
the
lower
branches
this
was
dangerous
but
seldom
fatal
whereas
the
gnawing
of
mice
near
the
base
of
the
trunks
was
such
that
in
some
cases
when
complete
girdling
occurred
it
was
necessary
to
use
to
save
the
trees
this
consists
of
connecting
the
bark
immediately
above
the
roots
with
the
bark
above
the
girdled
portion
so
that
the
tree
can
receive
and
send
the
food
substances
it
elaborates
to
its
upper
and
lower
parts
rabbits
and
mice
therefore
had
to
be
dealt
with
of
course
one
could
go
hunting
for
rabbits
and
later
eat
them
this
was
one
task
i
had
my
employees
do
i
myself
was
unwilling
to
take
an
active
part
in
it
although
still
intent
on
saving
my
trees
in
spite
of
my
pity
for
the
little
animals
placing
hundreds
of
cans
in
the
orchard
with
a
pinch
of
poisoned
wheat
and
oat
mixture
in
each
helped
to
eradicate
the
mice
the
bait
was
placed
inside
the
cans
to
prevent
birds
from
being
poisoned
and
the
cans
were
tipped
at
an
angle
so
that
water
would
not
enter
them
to
be
absolutely
sure
of
preventing
mice
damage
one
should
provide
each
tree
with
a
screen
guard
i
have
made
about
screen
protectors
for
my
trees
for
this
purpose
i
have
also
trapped
rabbits
which
we
were
not
able
to
shoot
and
i
conceived
the
idea
of
painting
the
traps
with
white
enamel
when
these
were
set
on
the
snow
around
those
trees
which
the
rabbits
attacked
they
worked
very
successfully
the
traps
were
a
size
larger
than
the
common
gopher
trap
but
were
not
expensive
there
are
other
ways
of
catching
rabbits
or
curtailing
their
activities
but
on
my
list
shooting
comes
first
with
trapping
as
a
second
effective
measure
squirrels
although
they
do
no
damage
to
the
trees
themselves
except
on
rare
occasions
are
a
definite
nuisance
when
they
come
in
large
numbers
and
cut
down
nuts
before
they
are
ripe
they
do
this
to
hickory
nuts
and
apparently
are
very
fond
of
the
nuts
i
have
seen
squirrels
chew
hickory
buds
and
young
sprouts
of
hickory
grafts
and
i
had
to
trap
several
before
i
stopped
them
from
doing
this
to
certain
ornamental
trees
in
our
garden
in
fact
when
one
has
a
large
nut
orchard
squirrels
will
be
attracted
in
number
that
preclude
the
possibility
of
harvesting
a
crop
unless
measures
are
taken
to
banish
them
they
are
very
active
early
in
the
morning
and
my
experiences
indicate
that
two
or
three
people
should
hunt
them
together
as
they
are
very
clever
at
dodging
a
single
hunter
i
also
have
built
galvanized
metal
guards
around
isolated
trees
which
prevent
squirrels
from
climbing
them
in
speaking
of
mice
we
have
two
important
species
commonly
known
as
the
meadow
mouse
and
the
other
species
known
as
the
mouse
the
meadow
mouse
is
the
one
that
does
so
much
damage
to
the
orchard
trees
and
young
nursery
stock
if
unprotected
and
the
mouse
may
be
responsible
for
some
of
this
when
present
in
great
numbers
but
of
the
mouse
this
much
good
can
be
said

much
of
its
diet
especially
of
the
mother
mouse
during
the
time
that
she
is
nursing
her
young
ones
is
made
up
of
insects
a
personal
experience
accentuates
this
since
these
are
such
pretty
little
creatures
having
such
cunning
ways
it
was
my
ambition
to
catch
a
complete
family
of
mother
and
young
ones
which
sometimes
numbered
as
high
as
ten
my
ambition
was
finally
gratified
and
i
was
able
to
get
a
mother
of
eight
and
her
tiny
mouslings
which
have
a
habit
of
fastening
themselves
securely
to
her
breasts
while
she
runs
about
and
drags
them
all
along
in
a
most
ludicrous
fashion
at
times
under
these
circumstances
the
combined
weight
of
the
brood
exceeds
that
of
the
mother
mouse
but
they
are
exceptionally
strong
creatures
for
their
size
a
mature
mouse
being
able
to
jump
out
of
a
barrel
with
one
leap
in
observing
this
brood
of
mice
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
see
what
kind
of
a
diet
they
throve
on
and
tried
the
mother
appetite
with
tidbits
from
the
table
while
she
ate
most
everything
it
soon
became
apparent
that
something
was
wrong
because
the
young
ones
became
weaker
finally
to
the
extent
that
they
were
unable
to
nurse
and
one
morning
i
found
several
on
their
backs
with
their
feet
feebly
waving
in
the
air
indicating
that
they
were
dying
of
starvation
at
about
that
time
i
was
drying
some
hazelnuts
on
a
flat
back
porch
floor
and
in
sweeping
them
up
found
a
lot
of
alive
and
dried
up
larvae
which
had
escaped
from
the
shells
just
for
fun
i
swept
this
material
up
and
threw
it
into
the
mouse
cage
the
reaction
of
this
treatment
was
gratifying
for
the
mother
mouse
pounced
upon
this
insect
life
greedily
devouring
everything
within
three
days
the
young
mice
were
all
in
good
health
and
running
around
showing
that
the
milk
produced
from
the
diet
that
i
had
been
giving
the
mother
was
inadequate
for
the
baby
mice
it
is
therefore
to
their
credit
to
state
that
these
mice
and
probably
at
times
the
meadow
mice
do
consume
large
quantities
of
larvae
and
grubs
in
the
surface
soil
as
well
as
mature

and
moles
a
great
deal
of
the
skunk
diet
is
insect
life
the
same
is
true
of
the
mole
whose
diet
probably
consists
of
insects
mostly
in
their
larval
state
this
is
an
important
feature
of
mole
and
skunk
as
they
dig
these
insects
out
before
they
mature
into
winged
female
adults
which
may
lay
hundreds
of
eggs
if
these
larvae
should
be
allowed
to
develop
into
a
mature
winged
insect
that
would
lay
eggs
this
particular
insect
would
multiply
itself
hundreds
of
times
over
and
it
would
take
many
more
birds
than
at
present
exist
to
take
over
the
big
job
of
keeping
the
balance
between
necessary
insect
life
and
a
surplus
which
would
be
destructive
to
all
plant
life
we
can
never
hope
to
eradicate
all
insect
life
which
we
deplore
as
being
deleterious
to
the
interests
of
mankind
and
it
is
mighty
well
that
we
can
not
do
this
for
the
insects
are
as
important
to
us
as
all
other
life
for
without
them
we
would
be
unable
to
produce
the
vast
quantities
of
foods
that
are
now
dependent
upon
such
insect
life
it
is
true
that
they
take
their
toll
of
the
food
that
they
are
instrumental
in
sometimes
producing
but
when
one
attempts
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
balance
of
nature
one
is
confronted
by
the
big
question
of
how
far
to
go
in
the
eradication
of
both
animals
and
insect
pests
before
interference
the
wild
crops
were
plentiful
and
balances
were
kept
in
harmony
by
vast
multitudes
of
frogs
and
toads
birds
and
rodents
all
of
which
have
been
slaughtered
and
reduced
by
such
amounts
as
to
endanger
man
food
supply
forcing
him
to
resort
to
poison
sprays
and
other
measures
in
order
to
hold
destruction
in
check
all
of
this
expense
and
trouble
he
could
have
avoided
if
he
had
been
sensible
enough
to
observe
the
natural
checks
and
foster
the
natural
procedure
of
which
nature
is
the
best
guide
chapter
storing
and
planting
seeds
most
nut
tree
seed
requires
ideal
storage
conditions
to
preserve
its
germinating
power
or
viability
under
natural
circumstances
such
nuts
as
black
walnuts
english
walnuts
butternuts
hickory
nuts
pecans
hazelnuts
filberts
and
almost
all
other
nuts
will
be
planted
by
squirrels
mice
and
other
rodents
although
most
of
these
will
be
eaten
by
the
animals
who
buried
them
a
large
percentage
of
the
ones
which
are
not
eaten
will
sprout
the
sprouts
which
achieve
maturity
and
bearing
age
however
will
be
only
a
very
small
percentage
some
say
only
a
fraction
of
of
the
number
that
sprouted
this
is
an
expensive
and
wasteful
method
horticulturally
speaking
but
it
does
indicate
that
it
is
best
to
plant
nuts
as
soon
as
possible
after
they
have
properly
ripened
and
been
dried
after
walnuts
hickory
nuts
butternuts
and
hazels
have
been
gathered
they
should
be
dried
until
the
hulls
have
lost
most
of
their
moisture
the
husks
should
be
removed
from
filberts
before
they
are
dried
while
this
preparation
is
not
essential
nuts
are
less
likely
to
mold
if
they
are
dried
somewhat
before
they
are
planted
however
i
have
planted
black
walnuts
and
butternuts
and
most
of
them
sprouted
if
nuts
are
to
be
stored
in
large
quantities
the
process
is
absolutely
essential
and
should
be
carried
to
the
point
of
completely
drying
the
hulls
the
system
i
followed
in
doing
this
is
to
gather
the
nuts
after
they
have
fallen
and
spread
them
out
in
the
sunlight
on
roofs
or
floors
where
air
can
circulate
around
them
after
the
hulls
are
dry
such
nuts
as
black
walnuts
english
walnuts
and
butternuts
may
be
put
in
barrels
or
burlap
bags
and
stored
in
an
unheated
basement
without
seriously
deteriorating
english
walnuts
are
most
safely
stored
when
they
are
hulled
before
being
packed
in
burlap
bags
these
bags
should
be
suspended
above
the
floor
of
the
cellar
by
a
rope
or
wire
these
are
additional
precautions
which
allow
better
circulation
of
air
further
prevention
of
mold
and
safety
from
mice
and
squirrels
chestnuts
beechnuts
and
acorns
require
more
care
when
they
are
to
be
stored
for
their
viability
is
very
sensitive
to
dryness
i
have
found
that
these
species
of
nuts
should
be
treated
in
a
different
manner
than
the
walnut
and
hickory
types
of
seeds
if
we
are
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
germination
since
chestnuts
are
very
prone
to
molding
or
rotting
the
best
way
to
maintain
their
viability
and
freshness
over
winter
is
to
stratify
them
in
a
can
or
box
between
layers
of
a
peat
moss
this
peat
moss
must
be
decidedly
on
the
acid
side
and
must
be
dampened
but
must
not
be
so
wet
that
you
can
wring
any
water
out
of
it
the
best
way
to
prepare
this
dry
peat
moss
is
to
soak
it
in
water
and
wring
as
much
water
out
of
it
as
possible
by
squeezing
with
your
hands
then
mix
it
with
half
as
much
of
the
undampened
peat
this
will
give
you
approximately
the
right
moisture
coefficient
if
stored
in
cans
the
bottom
of
the
can
must
be
punctured
with
a
few
holes
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
well
distributed
on
the
bottom
to
act
as
a
drain
and
to
admit
some
slight
circulation
of
air
the
same
thing
should
be
done
with
the
cover
first
put
down
an
even
layer
about
inches
of
this
dampened
moss
then
put
in
a
layer
of
chestnuts
or
other
nuts
to
be
stratified
placed
evenly
or
well
distributed
but
not
touching
each
other
after
the
first
layer
carefully
sift
in
more
dampened
moss
about
inch
thick
and
repeat
the
process
until
either
the
can
is
full
or
all
the
seeds
have
been
stored
the
last
layer
should
be
a
layer
of
peat
moss
before
the
cover
is
placed
on
now
the
important
thing
about
all
this
is
to
place
this
can
in
a
storage
room
of
low
temperature
and
yet
it
should
not
freeze
solid
but
in
a
temperature
of
from
to
degrees
is
ideal
and
preferably
it
should
be
on
the
ground
floor
so
as
to
maintain
the
moisture
that
is
already
stored
in
the
seed
and
the
moss
a
mechanical
refrigerator
which
would
constantly
dehydrate
might
eventually
dry
them
out
too
much
for
good
germination
otherwise
such
a
refrigerator
would
be
ideal
for
the
storage
of
small
amount
of
seeds
of
this
kind
it
would
be
well
from
time
to
time
to
inspect
these
seeds
to
see
whether
they
were
in
good
condition
and
check
the
temperatures
as
well
if
they
start
to
sprout
all
the
better
they
can
then
be
planted
with
the
sprout
downward
and
the
nut
barely
covered
with
earth
some
years
i
have
had
sprouts
nearly
six
inches
long
on
my
chestnuts
which
had
been
so
stored
and
care
will
have
to
be
taken
not
to
break
the
sprout
when
transplanting
the
nuts
in
planting
nuts
great
care
must
be
taken
not
to
plant
them
too
deeply
large
nuts
such
as
black
walnuts
butternuts
and
english
walnuts
are
often
planted
with
a
small
part
of
the
nut
still
exposed
certainly
the
depth
of
the
soil
over
a
nut
should
never
exceed
the
thickness
of
the
nut
most
seeds
develop
best
when
they
are
planted
just
under
the
surface
of
the
soil
the
earth
should
be
lightly
tamped
around
the
planted
seeds
to
eliminate
a
thin
coating
of
manure
not
more
than
three
inches
deep
is
valuable
if
large
seeds
are
planted
but
it
is
detrimental
to
the
development
of
small
seeds
and
manure
should
never
be
used
for
evergreens
seeds
of
the
nut
pines
usually
purchased
from
seedsmen
and
received
in
a
dry
state
should
be
planted
no
deeper
than
their
own
diameter
in
a
light
sandy
loam
a
seed
bed
incidentally
is
a
very
necessary
protection
against
rodents
in
the
case
of
nut
pine
seed
i
have
used
a
mixture
of
bone
meal
on
such
seeds
with
good
results

worked
into

ashes
scattered
over
the

proper
drying
and

are
of
no
use
if

will
have

other
hazards

nut

enough
into

a
stout

such

should
be
placed
on
the

so
that
a
similar

photo
by
there
are
several
important
points
to
remember
in
starting
a
seed
bed
it
must
be
in
a
site
so
that
the
seeds
will
not
be
under
water
or
for
any
length
of
time
it
should
be
in
an
open
place
where
sunlight
is
plentiful
unless
evergreens
are
being
grown
evergreens
must
be
in
the
first
season
to
avoid
a
condition
known
as
damping
off

six
inches
of
soil
in
the
bed
should
be
the
best
garden
soil
obtainable
the
growth
resulting
from
using
good
clean
soil
free
from

seeds
being
worth
the
trouble
of
preparing
it
by
having
the
bed
in
two
parts
with
a
cover
that
may
be
taken
off
proper
weeding
can
be
done
when
necessary
the

will
sometimes
attack
the
young
shoots
and
the
remainder
of
the

in
the
spring
of
the
second
season
of
growth
the
young
plants
may
be
dug
up
and
lined
out

rows
after
two
or
three

more
they
may
be

chapter
tree
planting
methods
since
nut
trees
usually
have
deep
root
systems
of
the
taproot
type
they
are
more
difficult
to
transplant
than
such
trees
as
plum
apple
elm
or
maple
which
have
many
small
fibrous
roots
taproots
have
a
long
main
trunk
like
a
parsnip
from
which
lateral
roots
branch
these
roots
are
heavy
and
may
extend
deep
into
the
ground
even
in
trees
only
two
or
three
years
old
in
moving
such
a
tree
the
lower
part
of
the
central
taproot
must
of
course
be
cut
off
but
as
many
of
the
side
roots
as
possible
are
retained
because
such
roots
have
no
fibrous
or
system
their
handling
during
transplantation
necessarily
differs
from
that
of
the
ordinary
shade
or
fruit
tree
if
trees
having
a
taproot
system
such
as
the
english
walnut
black
walnut
butternut
hickory
or
pecan
are
received
with
bare
roots
they
should
be
treated
in
the
following
way
immediately
after
the
trees
have
been
unpacked
their
roots
should
be
submerged
in
a
barrel
of
water
for
several
hours
after
their
thirst
has
been
quenched
the
roots
should
be
dipped
into
a
mixture
of
clay
and
water
made
to
the
consistency
of
thick
paint
with
a
heavy
coating
of
wet
clay
around
them
the
roots
may
then
be
wrapped
in
wet
burlap
sacks
they
are
now
ready
to
be
transported
to
their
planting
site
selecting
a
favorable
location
for
nut
trees
is
very
important
they
should
never
be
planted
at
the
bottom
of
a
gulch
or
valley
because
in
such
places
frost
pockets
may
occur
which
will
interfere
with
both
blossoming
in
the
spring
and
ripening
of
nuts
in
the
fall
nut
trees
grow
best
near
the
summit
of
a
hill
although
such
soils
are
difficult
to
plant
in
stony
soil
or
soil
overlaid
with
limestone
results
in
good
growth
shallow
surface
soil
underlaid
with
heavy
clay
will
usually
slow
down
the
growth
of
a
young
tree
so
that
it
remains
dwarfed
for
many
years
it
is
more
satisfactory
to
have
at
least
three
feet
of
soil
before
clay
is
reached
if
the
soil
is
light
and
sandy
it
will
be
improved
by
adding
black
dirt
immediately
around
the
roots
of
each
tree
as
most
nut
trees
ultimately
grow
to
be
very
large
they
should
be
planted
at
least
forty
feet
apart
the
hole
dug
to
receive
each
tree
should
be
wide
and
deep
enough
to
accommodate
the
roots
without
bending
or
twisting
them
if
the
excavated
soil
is
of
poor
quality
it
should
be
discarded
and
good
rich
soil
brought
in
for
setting
the
tree
trees
should
not
be
planted
too
deeply
the
collar
of
a
tree
which
is
a
discoloration
of
its
trunk
resulting
from
contact
with
the
ground
indicates
how
much
of
the
tree
was
previously
underground
although
it
is
a
good
idea
to
plant
so
that
this
collar
is
a
little
lower
than
the
surface
to
allow
access
to
extra
moisture
the
actual
planting
depth
should
be
about
as
it
was
previously
in
the
nursery
all
broken
or
damaged
parts
on
the
roots
should
be
trimmed
smoothly
with
pruning
shears
such
clean
cuts
will
send
out
new
rootlets
to
replace
the
lost
ones
after
a
tree
has
been
set
into
the
hole
made
for
it
the
soil
which
should
be
thoroughly
mixed
with
a
quart
of

its
fertility
is
replaced
a
little
at
a
time
it
must
be
packed
very
solidly
about
the
roots
with
a
rounded
tamping
stick
to
avoid
leaving
air
pockets
i
find
it
advisable
to
retamp
the
earth
about
each
tree
two
or
three
times
during
the
first
year
growing
season
to
insure
intimate
contact
between
soil
and
roots
planting
should
be
delayed
if
the
soil
is
very
wet
trees
will
stay
in
good
condition
for
several
days
if
the
burlap
sacks
are
kept
moistened
wet
soggy
soil
is
certain
to
shrink
away
from
the
roots
and
leave
air
pockets
which
will
in
time
kill
the
trees
if
trees
are
transplanted
during
a
very
dry
season
they
should
be
thoroughly
watered
to
do
this
remove
several
shovelfuls
of
dirt
from
the
ground
about
a
foot
from
the
tree
being
careful
not
to
cut
any
roots
fill
this
hole
with
water
and
after
the
water
has
seeped
away
fill
it
two
more
times
the
tree
should
receive
about
five
gallons
of
water
sprinkling
with
a
hose
does
not
suffice
if
dry
weather
continues
each
tree
should
be
watered
in
this
way
every
week
nurserymen
in
the
future
will
have
to
deal
with
this
transplanting
problem
in
a
different
way
than
the

who

a
suggested
way
to

the
way
an

to
prepare
a
pocket
of
special
transplanting
soil
previous
to
the
lining
out
which
is
the
term
used
by
nurserymen
in
setting
out
seedlings
preparatory
to
grafting
them
in
nursery
rows
a
suggested
balanced
soil
for
making
the
method
practical
is
to
use
by
volume
of
peat
moss
the
other
half
should
be
rich
black
sandy
loam
with
very
little
clay
mixture
in
it
in
other
words
each
nut
tree
should
be
allowed
about
a
bushel
of
soil
for
its
development
bushel
to
be
peat
moss
the
other
half
bushel
to
be
represented
by
rich
black
loam
this
mixture
will
encourage
many
fibrous
roots
to
develop
and
when
the
tree
is
dug
approximately
all
of
this
bushel
of
soil
will
be
retained
around
the
roots
having
such
a
high
proportion
of
peat
moss
makes
it
lighter
than
ordinary
ground
such
a
ball
and
the
tree
will
weigh
approximately
from
to
pounds
which
can
be
shipped
by
freight
at
a
low
rate
and
is
well
worth
the
extra
price
that
nurserymen
must
ask
for
a
specimen
of
this
kind
such
trees
have
really
never
been
unplanted
and
for
this
reason
do
not
suffer
the
shock
which
is
inevitable
in
the
usual
transplanting
process
although
trees
are
more
expensive
to
buy
and
to
transport
their
improved
chances
of
living
make
them
worth
the
price
the
above
recommendation
is
especially
applicable
to
young
grafted
hickory
trees
since
they
are
among
the
most
difficult
trees
to
transplant
satisfactorily
the
english
walnut
persian
black
walnut
butternut
and
especially
the
hickory
are
improved
by
the
use
of
a
handful
of
ground
lime
mixed
with
the
soil
in
preparing
these
pockets
which
will
later
constitute
the
ball
surrounding
the
roots
of
the
tree
to
be
transplanted
there
is
a
tendency
in
grafted
trees
to
produce
sprouts
below
the
graft
unless
these
are
rubbed
off
the
grafted
portion
will
become
discouraged
and
the
tree
will
revert
to
a
seedling
variety
filberts
should
never
be
allowed
more
than
two
or
three
stems
or
trunks
while
one
is
more
preferable
if
they
are
allowed
to
have
more
they
will
produce
a
rank
growth
of
wood
but
only
a
few
if
any
nuts
i
stress
by
repeating
that
trees
should
not
be
planted
too
deeply
and
that
great
care
must
be
taken
to
eliminate
air
pockets
extra
effort
and
nursing
of
transplanted
trees
during
the
first
season
will
be
repaid
by
their
successful
development
and
growth
it
is
a
wise
precaution
to
place
a
protective
screen
around
the
trunk
of
each
tree
to
prevent
rodents
from
attacking
it
mice
gnaw
off
the
bark
near
the
ground
sometimes
girdling
a
tree
and
so
killing
it
rabbits
chew
off
branches
and
they
too
may
girdle
the
upper
part
of
a
tree
rabbits
are
very
fond
of
pecan
and
hickory
bark
in
some
places
it
may
be
necessary
to
encircle
each
pecan
and
hickory
tree
with
a
three
or
rabbit
fence
until
the
tree
is
large
enough
to
lose
its
appeal
to
these
nuisances
compared
with
the
number
of
insects
which
infest
fruit
trees
very
few
attack
nut
trees
one
of
those
which
does
is
the
caterpillar
these
appear
as
a
closely
congregated
group
of
small
worms
which
feed
on
the
leaves
of
black
walnut
and
hickory
trees
during
the
latter
half
of
the
summer
season
very
often
they
are
all
to
be
found
on
a
single
leaf
which
should
be
picked
from
the
tree
and
crushed
underfoot
a
simple
spray
of
lead
arsenate
of
the
strength
recommended
by
companies
selling
spray
material
will
effectively
rid
trees
of
these
pests
another
insect
often
found
in
a
nut
orchard
is
the
oak
tree
girdler
which
also
is
active
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
it
often
causes
limbs
as
large
as
an
inch
in
diameter
to
be
cut
through
and
to
fall
to
the
ground
by
removing
such
freshly
girdled
branches
and
cutting
into
the
hollow
made
by
the
larva
it
is
possible
to
find
the
live
worm
and
destroy
it
a
good
way
to
combat
this
pest
is
to
keep
each
tree
pruned
of
all
dead
branches
and
to
burn
all
broken
and
dead
wood
each
fall
while
some
nut
trees
are
subject
to
other
insects
the
two
described
here
are
the
most
frequently
found
fortunately
they
are
easily
controlled
if
a
watch
is
kept
for
them
chapter
winter
protection
of
grafts
and
seedlings
it
is
not
enough
to
make
a
successful
graft
and
to
watch
it
carefully
during
the
growing
season
picking
all
sprouts
off
the
stock
spraying
it
so
that
insects
will
not
chew
the
tender
leaves
and
bark
bracing
it
against
windstorms
and
perching
birds
each
graft
must
also
be
protected
from
winter
injury
for
many
years
i
have
studied
and
experimented
to
find
a
successful
way
of
achieving
such
protection
to
enumerate
my
many
experiments
from
simple
to
would
be
to
write
another
book
quite
as
long
as
this
one
my
conclusion
now
is
that
there
is
little
one
can
do
to
assist
nature
in
the
process
of
acclimatizing
grafted
plants
and
seedlings
i
have
repeatedly
noticed
that
the
place
where
most
damage
is
done
by
the
cold
is
at
the
union
between
stock
and
graft
for
example
i
observed
this
on
the
european
walnuts
imported
from
poland
grafted
to
minnesota
black
walnut
stocks
although
both
the
buds
and
the
wood
of
the
top
remained
fresh
and
green
the
unions
suffered
severe
and
sometimes
total
winter
injury
in
grafts
where
the
latter
occurred
the
dead
cells
soon
caused
the
wood
to
ferment
and
sour
occasionally
a
small
group
of
healthy
cells
succeeded
in
circulation
with
the
unharmed
grafted
top
and
the
graft
continuing
its
growth
would
eventually
overcome
the
injury
it
had
suffered
i
have
seen
this
occur
with
grafts
of
english
walnut
apricot
and
pecan
a
blackbird
nest
in
the
crotch
of
a
small
tree
suggested
to
me
the
most
satisfactory
guard
i
have
yet
found
against
this
greatest
of
dangers
to
all
exotic
grafted
varieties
of
nut
trees
the
nest
which
enclosed
over
half
of
the
graft
union
was
partly
composed
of
woolen
fibers
which
its
builder
had
gathered
from
fences
that
sheep
had
brushed
against
on
the
exposed
portion
of
the
graft
union
discoloration
indicated
injury
and
dead
cells
but
on
that
part
covered
by
the
nest
all
the
cells
were
alive
and
green
i
have
improved
on
the
bird
nest
by
wrapping
a
large
wad
of
wool
loosely
around
each
graft
union
the
value
of
wool
is
that
it
will
not
collect
moisture
and
so
start
fermentation
it
allows
the
cells
to
breathe
yet
protects
the
union
from
the
shock
of
temperature
extremes
birds
will
inevitably
steal
some
of
the
strands
of
wool
but
this
activity
in
and
about
the
trees
means
a
decrease
in
injuries
from
insects
a
worthwhile
exchange
when
an
unusually
large
swelling
at
the
graft
union
appears
it
is
certain
that
the
plant
needs
protection
such
as
i
have
described
such
swellings
result
from
a
multiplication
of
cells
a
condition
which
leaves
the
union
weak
and
susceptible
to
injury
although
a
union
is
never
entirely
safe
even
after
many
seasons
of
growth
each
year
adds
to
the
safety
factor
by
the
development
of
rough
bark
i
suggest
the
use
of
a
woolen
guard
for
several
winters
by
which
time
this
outer
bark
should
be
able
to
do
its
protective
work
alone
a
successful
but
rather
expensive
method
of
winter
protection
both
to
the
graft
itself
and
its
union
with
its
host
is
to
enclose
the
entire
tree
with
a
structure
consisting
of
four
corrugated
aluminum
roofing
sheets
set
up
on
their
ends
and
countersunk
into
the
ground
about
six
inches
the
purpose
of
countersinking
these
below
the
ground
surface
is
it
stiffens
and
braces
the
structure
and
prevents
the
intrusion
of
mice
and
other
rodents
which
may
also
appreciate
both
the
shelter
and
possible
food
supply
contained
therein
by
fastening
these
sheets
together
with
a
stout
wire
you
can
depend
on
the
structure
to
stand
up
against
wind
and
snow
pressures
fill
the
entire
inside
with
forest
leaves
oak
leaves
preferred
as
their
insulating
quality
is
the
best
and
they
are
slow
to
rot
and
ferment
when
working
with
plants
in
a
cold
climate
avoid
fertilizing
and
cultivating
the
ground
after
the
first
of
august
doing
so
stimulates
late
growth
and
such
growth
is
very
likely
to
be
badly
injured
during
the
winter
months
if
fertilizer
is
used
it
should
be
early
in
the
spring
as
soon
as
the
ground
is
free
from
frost
trees
which
persist
in
growing
late
into
the
fall
are
more
subject
to
winter
injury
protective
measures
to
avoid
their
doing
so
by
inducing
an
earlier
dormancy
include
keeping
the
soil
around
them
dry
and
exposing
somewhat
the
roots
near
the
trunk
of
each
tree
my
last
word
of
advice
in
raising
what
might
be
termed
trees
is
to
grow
them
in
sod
the
ordinary
quack
grass
june
grass
bluegrass
or
other
natural
grass
sods
which
can
be
found
on
your
planting
site
although
this
will
probably
hold
back
your
tree
development
for
a
few
years
until
the
roots
are
thoroughly
established
in
the
deeper
soil
beneath
the
sod
roots
it
is
surprising
how
many
species
of
trees
will
thrive
in
sod
and
perish
on
open
cultivated
ground
i
can
give
no
better
example
of
this
than
relating
a
circumstance
which
bears
this
out
in
a
most
convincing
way
in
i
purchased
about
filbert
seedlings
from
samuel
graham
of
ithaca
new
york
these
were
planted
out
on
a
field
site
and
practically
all
of
the
plants
made
good
growth
the
first
year
they
were
thoroughly
cultivated
the
next
year
a
second
batch
of
plants
of
a
like
amount
were
purchased
from
the
same
man
and
of
the
same
kind
of
seedlings
graham
told
me
that
these
were
seedling
trees
from
jones
hybrid
seeds
which
he
had
growing
in
his
orchard
these
plants
were
put
on
heavy
sod
ground
all
plants
were
protected
by
screens
but
the
plants
on
the
sod
ground
were
subject
to
a
very
wet
season
and
it
was
necessary
to
build
up
the
soil
around
some
of
the
plants
in
order
to
save
them
from
being
drowned
out
today
about
plants
are
living
on
the
sod
culture
and
two
or
three
barely
alive
exist
in
the
open
field
culture
although
the
plants
remaining
alive
on
the
sod
culture
plot
are
almost
pure
filbert
strain
they
are
therefore
very
subject
to
the
common
hazel
blight
some
have
grown
into
bushes
feet
high
which
later
were
hit
by
blight
and
have
been
reduced
to
small
bushes
others
are
producing
good
nuts
and
are
somewhat
blight
resistant
but
the
main
fact
to
remember
is
that
about
of
the
plants
on
sod
culture
lived
whereas
not
over
are
alive
of
the
open
field
culture
plants
the
distance
between
these
plantings
is
approximately
of
a
mile
in
addition
to
being
placed
in
sod
these
filberts
which
have
survived
are
sheltered
by
rows
of
evergreen
trees
both
on
the
south
and
on
the
north
side
which
may
be
construed
as
of
some
assistance
but
is
not
altogether
the
reason
for
the
tremendous
difference
between
the
winter
protection
value
of
sod
and
open
field
culture
this
is
not
the
only
example
that
i
could
cite
but
is
one
of
the
most
outstanding
ones
which
has
come
to
my
attention
sod
culture
is
now
being
recommended
to
fruit
orchardists
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
in
my
own
experience
i
can
highly
recommend
it
for
apples
plums
pears
mulberries
and
nut
trees
chapter
tree
storage
if
it
is
necessary
to
store
trees
through
the
winter
months
one
of
several
procedures
may
be
followed
if
the
trees
are
quite
small
their
tops
may
be
dipped
in
melted
paraffin
or
beeswax
not
hot
enough
to
injure
the
buds
if
the
trees
are
too
large
for
this
to
be
practical
wax
may
be
painted
on
with
a
brush
roots
should
be
protected
by
heeling
them
in
dirt
an
unheated
cellar
with
a
dirt
floor
is
a
very
satisfactory
place
for
storing
trees
select
a
corner
of
the
cellar
far
from
any
source
of
heat
or
temperature
change
place
the
trees
so
that
the
roots
are
pointing
toward
the
basement
wall
cover
the
roots
to
a
depth
of
six
inches
with
either
sand
or
sandy
loam
packing
the
soil
firmly
to
eliminate
air
pockets
lastly
cover
the
trees
completely
with
burlap
sacks
once
every
two
weeks
the
earth
around
the
roots
should
be
watered
trees
maintained
in
this
way
are
conveniently
ready
to
plant
when
the
ground
thaws
out
in
the
spring
another
and
better
method
of
storing
trees
is
to
plant
them
outside
in
a
trench
preferably
on
the
north
side
of
a
building
having
first
waxed
them
as
described
above
one
side
of
the
trench
should
slope
so
that
the
trees
will
lie
in
an
oblique
position
with
their
branches
touching
the
ground
the
roots
of
these
trees
should
be
covered
with
dirt
then
more
trees
set
alongside
them
until
all
have
been
planted
and
the
earth
made
firm
about
their
roots
trees
will
usually
suffer
no
damage
during
such
winter
storage
if
their
roots
have
been
properly
packed
in
sand
or
sandy
loam
six
or
more
cans
each
containing
a
little
poisoned
grain
should
be
set
among
the
branches
if
these
cans
are
laid
on
their
sides
rodents
will
have
easier
access
to
the
poison
the
branches
of
the
trees
should
then
be
well
covered
with
straw
or
hay
with
heavy
boards
laid
on
top
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
if
trees
are
received
for
planting
after
the
ground
has
frozen
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
build
a
log
fire
on
the
side
where
they
are
to
be
heeled
in
this
will
thaw
out
the
soil
enough
so
that
a
trench
can
be
made
to
accommodate
them
chapter
suggestions
on
grafting
methods
grafting
including
budding
may
be
defined
as
inserting
a
piece
of
wood
which
carries
buds
of
a
desired
variety
on
a
root
stock
sufficiently
compatible
to
accept
it
for
the
purpose
of
propagation
methods
vary
each
nurseryman
having
one
or
more
which
he
prefers
but
the
principle
is
always
the
same
scionwood
may
be
cut
the
fall
before
grafting
is
to
be
done
after
the
growing
season
has
ended
but
some
prefer
to
cut
the
scions
in
early
spring
this
means
that
the
scions
must
be
stored
until
time
to
graft
and
correct
storage
is
so
important
that
nurserymen
make
elaborate
provision
for
it
i
have
found
that
keeping
scions
underground
in
a
harrington
graft
storage
box
is
the
safest
method
an
illustration
of
this
box
is
given
with
directions
for
its
construction
and
location
a
small
quantity
of
scions
may
be
kept
in
an
icebox
not
a
mechanical
refrigerator
by
cutting
them
into
convenient
lengths
of
one
or
two
feet
dipping
them
in
melted
beeswax
wrapping
them
in
tar
or
asphalt
paper
and
placing
them
close
to
the
ice
they
will
remain
in
good
condition
for
several
months
if
there
is
always
a
good
supply
of
ice
care
must
be
taken
in
dipping
the
scions
in
melted
wax
for
if
the
wax
is
too
hot
it
will
injure
the
buds
it
should
never
become
so
hot
that
it
smokes
i
find
it
advisable
to
keep
an
unmelted
piece
of
wax
in
the
liquid
wax
to
hold
the
temperature
down
another
method
of
storing
scions
after
they
have
been
dipped
in
beeswax
is
to
place
them
on
the
earth
of
a
cellar
floor
and
cover
them
with
a
few
burlap
sacks
they
should
never
be
allowed
to
become
wet
or
they
will
start
to
mold
if
they
are
to
be
stored
in
this
way
a
watch
must
be
kept
for
mice
which
will
molest
them
and
destroy
them
if
they
have
an
opportunity
although
bud
wood
may
be
stored
in
any
of
the
three
ways
mentioned
it
should
not
be
waxed
because
of
this
it
is
more
likely
to
deteriorate
it
must
be
examined
frequently
and
if
mold
is
found
the
wood
should
be
dipped
in
a
bordeaux
solution
after
drying
it
may
be
placed
in
storage
again
it
is
a
good
plan
to
wrap
bud
wood
in
tar
or
asphalt
paper
when
storing
it
however
i
have
found
that
the
best
storage
conditions
for
all
scionwood
that
i
have
yet
discovered
is
in
the
use
of
peat
moss
peat
moss
must
be
on
the
distinctly
acid
side
in
order
to
perform
the
function
of
storing
scionwood
most
peat
moss
is
generally
acid
however
the
simple
litmus
paper
test
with
which
every
high
school
pupil
is
familiar
can
be
made
having
acquired
good
acid
peat
moss
dampen
a
sufficient
quantity
to
pack
the
scions
in
to
give
them
liberal
protection
do
not
make
the
bundles
of
scionwood
too
large
from
to
scions
in
a
bundle
is
better
than
a
large
number
and
much
easier
to
handle
the
moss
should
be
prepared
exactly
the
same
as
advised
in
storing
chestnuts
see
chapter
for
storing
seeds
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
wax
the
scions
at
all
the
moss
should
be
applied
by
sifting
it
into
the
open
spaces
between
the
scions
and
a
larger
wad
at
the
base
of
the
cuttings
not
at
the
terminal
or
bud
ends
as
these
would
be
better
left
unpacked
the
package
is
now
rolled
into
a
cylinder
using
tar
paper
or
asphalt
treated
paper
and
both
ends
left
open
do
not
use
ordinary
paper
or
wax
paper
as
it
will
turn
moldy
cylinders
of
tar
paper
containing
the
packed
scions
should
be
placed
in
a
damp
room
like
a
cellar
with
a
dirt
floor
which
is
cold
enough
to
keep
potatoes
and
other
roots
in
good
condition
throughout
the
winter
if
the
cellar
is
not
a
good
storage
cellar
for
roots
and
herbs
it
will
not
be
good
enough
for
the
scionwood
as
it
will
be
too
warm
generally
neither
should
they
be
frozen
solid
therefore
if
a
good
root
cellar
is
not
obtainable
then
these
should
be
put
in
the
harrington
graft
box
already
described
or
placed
under
the
sawdust
in
an
icehouse
and
close
to
the
ice
an
ice
refrigerator
will
also
make
a
good
storage
bin
placing
them
close
to
the
ice
at
all
times

a
scarf
with
a
plane
preparatory
to
selection
of
good
scionwood
and
bud
wood
a
very
important
matter
is
made
according
to
definite
standards
some
plants
graft
better
if
wood
is
used
that
has
two
seasons
growth
but
in
general
wood
of
the
current
season
growth
is
used
it
must
have
reached
its
maximum
possible
maturity
before
it
is
cut
also
some
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
vigor
of
the
growth
which
it
has
made
during
the
season
for
instance
in
choosing
between
wood
which
has
made
only
two
or
three
inches
growth
and
that
which
has
made
a
foot
or
more
of
growth
both
being
equally
sound
and
mature
the
more
vigorous
should
be
chosen
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
development
of
the
buds
which
should
be
plump
and
never
immature
it
is
advisable
to
label
scions
before
they
are
stored
to
avoid
the
confusion
that
will
result
if
they
are
mixed
i
find
that
the
best
method
of
doing
this
is
to
get
a
sheet
of
zinc
from
to
gauge
thick
and
cut
it
into
strips
one
inch
wide
by
one
and
inches
long
i
bore
a
small
hole
in
one
corner
of
each
tag
through
which
i
thread
copper
wire
doubled
and
with
the
bottom
loop
folded
over
see
page
in
preparing
these
tags
it
is
important
to
remember
that
both
wires
must
pass
through
the
hole
in
the
metal
tag
otherwise
the
slight
movement
due
to
winds
will
cause
the
metal
to
wear
through
two
wires
prevent
this
action
indefinitely
since
a
small
wire
cuts
through
a
zinc
tag
in
one
or
two
years
heavy
wire
must
be
used
wire
such
as
i
have
indicated
is
satisfactory
i
print
the
necessary
information
on
each
tag
with
a
small
steel
awl
and
such
labels
are
still
legible
after
years
copper
brass
or
aluminum
would
also
make
good
tags
but
these
metals
are
more
expensive
of
course
these
tags
may
be
used
for
small
trees
as
well
as
grafts
and
scionwood
and
it
is
always
well
to
do
a
good
job
of
labeling
all
work
since
many
errors
may
result
from
disregard
to
this
important
detail
in
the
north
the
time
to
graft
nut
trees
is
when
the
cambium
layer
of
the
host
or
stock
is
active
which
is
usually
during
the
entire
month
of
may
this
cambium
layer
consists
of
those
cells
lying
just
inside
of
the
outer
bark
between
it
and
the
woody
part
of
the
tree
when
these
cells
are
active
the
inner
side
of
the
bark
feels
slippery
and
a
substance
can
be
scraped
from
it
although
this
is
the
state
in
which
the
stock
should
be
for
grafting
the
condition
of
the
scions
should
be
almost
the
opposite
rather
dry
and
showing
no
signs
of
cambium
activity
the
bark
should
cling
firmly
to
the
woody
part
of
the
scions
whereas
the
bark
of
the
stock
should
slip
off
readily
another
good
and
fairly
satisfactory
rule
is
never
to
graft
the
stocks
of
nut
trees
until
after
the
young
leaves
appear
in
grafting
young
nursery
trees
not
more
than
an
inch
in
diameter
the
whole
tree
is
cut
off
at
any
distance
from
the
ground
convenient
to
the
nurseryman
sometimes
they
are
cut
within
a
few
inches
of
the
ground
sometimes
two
or
three
feet
in
my
work
i
like
to
keep
the
scions
as
high
above
the
ground
as
i
can
when
the
top
of
a
stock
is
cut
off
there
is
a
great
deal
of
sap
pressure
and
the
tree
bleeds
it
is
a
poor
policy
to
attempt
grafting
while
this
is
happening
rather
one
should
cut
the
tops
off
then
wait
for
several
days
before
inserting
any
grafts
tools
must
be
kept
very
sharp
a
good
grafting
knife
is
sharpened
on
one
side
only
so
that
the
blade
is
flat
along
the
side
which
lies
next
to
the
cut
made
on
the
scion
when
it
is
trimmed
if
unaccustomed
to
handling
a
knife
one
can
obtain
more
accurate
results
by
using
a
small
plane
i
do
this
by
holding
the
scion
firmly
in
my
right
hand
and
pulling
it
toward
me
against
the
cutting
edge
of
the
plane
which
is
held
in
the
left
hand
illustrations
show
how
this
is
done
the
only
disadvantage
in
using
a
plane
is
that
one
must
exchange
it
for
a
knife
to
make
the
receiving
cut
in
the
stock
before
inserting
the
graft
this
necessitates
exposing
the
graft
to
the
air
for
a
longer
time
than
does
using
a
single
instrument
spring
budding
is
done
during
the
same
period
as
grafting
bud
wood
is
usually
much
larger
in
diameter
than
scionwood
for
it
is
easier
to
remove
buds
from
big
branches
than
from
wood
only

in

is
to
be

no

should
be

off
all
the
tree

enough
of
it
may
remain

the

to
brace
the

be
necessary

i

around

i
have
a
material
which
holds
the
graft

at

excludes

the

also
seems
to
encourage
the
formation
of
that
tissue
which
unites
the

in

should
be
brushed
into

always
occur
in

not
necessary
to
shade
new
grafts
to
do
this
cover
them
with

white
paper
sacks
never
use
glassine
alone

whatever
tying

either
to
fasten
on

to

it
should
be

it
may
constrict
the
graft

stock

injure

cut
off
the

to
remember
that

grafting
tape
versus
raffia
it
is
necessary
that
a
person
who
is
grafting
trees
and
developing
hybrids
experiment
not
only
with
the
plants
he
is
interested
in
but
also
with
the
equipment
and
materials
he
uses
for
more
than
twelve
years
i
used
raffia
to
tie
the
grafts
i
made
becoming
more
annoyed
and
irritated
with
its
limitations
each
year
finally
i
began
trying
other
materials
until
i
found
one
which
i
think
is
very
satisfactory
this
is
a
rubberized
grafting
tape
at
my
nursery
we
make
our
own
tape
we
buy
pure
rubber
gum
known
as
lotol
from
the
naugatuck
chemical
company
at
a
cost
of
for
five
gallons
their
factory
with
this
we
use
unbleached
muslin
of
an
x
mesh
or
finer
as
the
muslin
is
usually
a
yard
wide
we
fold
it
and
take
it
to
a
printing
firm
where
for
a
small
charge
it
is
cut
into
both
and
inch
strips
by
being
fed
through
a
machine
we
use
the
wider
strips
for
heavy
work
on
large
trees
which
have
three
to
stubs
the
narrower
strips
we
use
in
the
nursery
grafting
young
seedlings
first
pour
about
a
gallon
of
the
rubber
compound
into
a
twelve
or
pail
having
a
smooth
rolled
edge
next
separate
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
strips
of
muslin
then
set
out
a
pair
of
rails
on
which
to
dry
the
tape
after
it
has
been
dipped
i
make
these
rails
by
using
two
x
boards
about
twelve
feet
in
length
nailed
together
at
the
ends
with
boards
two
feet
long
this
frame
resting
on
carpenter
horses
or
benches
makes
a
good
drying
rack
holding
a
piece
of
tape
by
one
end
submerge
it
in
the
rubber
solution
forcing
it
down
with
a
spatula
or
knife
swishing
it
around
or
moving
it
up
and
down
several
times
helps
to
fill
the
pores
with
rubber
drag
it
from
the
solution
by
pulling
it
sharply
over
the
rolled
edge
of
the
pail
using
the
spatula
on
the
upper
side
of
the
strip
to
scrape
off
superfluous
rubber
a
little
practice
soon
enables
one
to
judge
the
amount
of
rubber
needed
on
the
tape
there
should
not
be
so
much
that
it
drips
off
hang
the
tape
on
the
rack
so
that
the
ends
are
attached
to
the
rails
the
tape
sagging
slightly
in
the
center
space
the
pieces
of
tape
so
that
they
do
not
touch
for
if
they
do
they
will
be
very
difficult
to
separate
later
after
they
have
dried
for
hours
wind
the
tape
on
pieces
of
cardboard
about
one
foot
square
being
careful
not
to
overlap
the
tape
the
tape
is
now
ready
for
i
want
to
mention
some
of
the
advantages
i
have
found
in
using
this
rubberized
tape
rather
than
raffia
the
tape
is
uniform
throughout
and
is
stronger
than
raffia
it
does
not
fly
around
and
frequently
get
tangled
as
the
latter
does
there
is
no
necessity
for
keeping
it
slightly
damp
to
be
usable
it
may
easily
be
torn
off
at
any
convenient
length
or
it
may
be
cut
without
injuring
the
edge
of
the
grafting
knife
a
last
advantage
is
that
it
is
since
it
overlaps
on
itself
slightly
when
wound
around
a
graft
union
because
of
this
there
is
no
necessity
for
painting
the
finished
graft
with
melted
wax
as
is
absolutely
vital
when
using
raffia
personally
i
use
wax
in
addition
to
the
tape
for
i
feel
that
it
is
probably
safer
with
that
extra
protection
also
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
wax
over
the
tip
end
of
the
scion
when
it
is
devoid
of
a
terminal
bud
the
only
disadvantage
in
using
tape
is
its
cost
which
i
must
admit
is
very
much
higher
than
that
of
raffia
but
if
by
using
tape
twice
as
many
grafts
can
be
made
each
day
and
if
the
resulting
takes
are
better
as
they
have
been
in
my
experience
then
the
cost
is
justified
and
raffia
is
actually
the
more
expensive
to
use
chapter
effects
of
grafting
on
unlike
stocks
it
is
unquestionably
a
great
shock
to
a
tree
when
of
its
top
is
cut
off
if
it
is
healthy
and
vigorous
the
root
system
will
try
to
recover
using
every
means
possible
to
do
so
if
a
new
top
is
grafted
to
it
the
stock
must
either
accept
and
nourish
that
foreign
and
sometimes
incompatible
new
part
or
give
up
its
struggle
for
life
nature
and
the
tree
stock
usually
accept
the
challenge
and
the
graft
begins
to
grow
in
an
attempt
to
continue
with
its
own
identity
the
stock
will
bring
into
activity
adventitious
buds
these
are
tiny
microscopic
buds
imbedded
in
the
bark
of
a
tree
that
are
not
apparent
to
the
eye
but
are
protection
against
destruction
of
the
individual
plant
but
these
must
be
removed
by
the
horticulturist
to
insure
proper
nourishment
of
the
grafts
because
the
root
system
is
striving
hard
to
live
and
because
it
is
usually
the
stronger
it
may
force
the
top
to
accept
certain
of
its
characteristics
occasionally
it
may
assume
some
qualities
of
the
original
top
such
cooperation
is
necessary
if
either
is
to
survive
first
of
all
the
grafted
scions
must
accept
the
vital
quality
of
climatic
hardiness
a
powerful
factor
developed
through
ages
spent
in
a
certain
climate
to
hasten
the
acclimatization
of
a
tender
variety
i
cut
scionwood
from
such
unions
early
in
the
winter
storing
it
until
spring
when
these
scions
are
grafted
on
new
root
systems
i
find
that
they
are
much
more
readily
accepted
than
the
first
grafts
were
the
following
season
i
allow
the
grafts
of
this
later
union
to
go
through
their
first
winter
of
exposure
early
each
spring
i
continue
to
cut
scions
from
the
most
recent
unions
and
graft
them
to
new
root
systems
so
hastening
and
setting
the
factor
of
hardiness
through
frequent
asexual
propagation
because
my
observations
of
the
effects
of
scion
on
root
and
vice
versa
have
not
extended
over
a
sufficient
period
of
time
i
think
it
is
possible
that
the
changes
i
have
seen
may
be
only
transient
in
any
case
i
do
know
that
the
phenomenon
occurs
for
i
have
seen
many
examples
of
it
one
instance
in
which
the
stock
was
apparently
affecting
the
scions
occurred
in
the
case
of
several
varieties
of
black
walnuts
which
had
been
grafted
on
wild
butternut
stock
over
a
period
of
sixteen
years
the
walnut
top
flourished
but
tended
to
outgrow
the
butternut
so
that
the
caliber
of
the
walnut
was
greater
than
that
of
the
stock
a
few
inches
below
the
graft
union
i
also
noticed
that
although
the
graft
began
to
bear
about
as
early
as
black
walnuts
do
when
they
are
grafted
on
their
own
species
the
nuts
did
not
mature
at
all
during
the
first
few
years
of
bearing
in
after
a
favorable
season
i
found
mature
nuts
on
one
variety
the
thomas
these
nuts
varied
in
size
more
than
they
do
when
grafted
on
black
walnut
the
most
surprising
thing
about
them
though
was
that
they
did
not
have
the
characteristic
black
walnut
flavor
when
properly
dried
and
cured
they
could
have
passed
as
an
entirely
different
nut
since
they
tasted
like
neither
the
black
walnut
the
butternut
nor
the
persian
walnut
the
overgrowth
of
the
ohio
black
walnut
grafted
on
butternut
was
even
more
apparent
than
that
of
the
thomas
these
nuts
were
as
i
have
said
immature
the
first
few
years
they
appeared
and
they
too
lacked
the
usual
black
walnut
flavor
in
their
case
however
the
most
striking
change
was
in
the
shape
and
structure
of
their
shells
which
were
elongated
like
butternuts
with
corrugations
typical
of
those
found
on
butternuts
and
nearly
as
deep
and
sharp
see
illustration
in
chapter
page
in
i
made
experimental
graftings
on
native
black
walnut
stocks
of
the
weschcke
no
butternut
a
variety
i
found
to
be
superior
to
hundreds
of
other
native
trees
tested
the
grafts
grew
luxuriantly
and
in
produced
about
two
pounds
of
nuts
these
nuts
were
approximately
larger
than
those
on
the
parent
tree
they
cracked
well
and
the
kernels
were
similar
to
those
from
the
parent
tree
they
definitely
distinguished
themselves
however
by
being
a
nut
which
is
not
true
of
the
mother
tree
nor
of
most
butternuts
soon
after
the
nuts
had
dropped
to
the
ground
and
were
still
green
they
were
hulled
and
their
hulls
peeled
off
like
those
of
the
persian
walnut
leaving
the
nuts
clean
and
free
from
remnants
apparently
this
phenomenon
was
a
transient
one
since
later
crops
did
not
display
this
feature
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
the
seedling
apricot
which
came
into
bearing
in
paul
and
how
i
obtained
grafts
before
it
died
during
a
very
cold
winter
i
have
grafted
scions
of
this
apricot
on
both
hybrid
and
wild
plum
stocks
repeatedly
and
this
apricot
now
exhibits
a
material
gain
in
hardiness
it
overgrows
the
plum
stock
but
this
does
not
seem
to
inhibit
its
bearing
the
fruit
growing
to
greater
size
than
that
of
the
mother
tree
these
are
some
of
the
instances
in
which
i
have
seen
stock
exert
a
definite
and
mainly
a
beneficial
influence
on
its
grafted
top
it
may
easily
be
that
these
are
only
of
a
temporary
nature
and
until
i
have
seen
them
maintained
for
many
more
years
i
must
consider
them
to
be
transient
effects
chapter
distinguishing
characteristics
of
scions
loss
of
identification
markings
from
my
grafted
trees
has
on
occasion
caused
me
much
confusion
there
was
one
time
when
i
had
from
six
to
ten
varieties
of
hickories
and
their
hybrids
grafted
on
wild
bitternut
hickory
stocks
totally
lacking
in
identification
although
this
disconcerted
me
considerably
i
knew
of
nothing
i
could
do
except
to
wait
for
the
grafts
to
bear
nuts
and
determine
the
varieties
from
these
as
i
continued
my
experimental
grafting
i
made
sure
that
the
tags
i
used
were
not
only
indestructible
but
also
secured
to
the
grafts
in
such
a
way
that
the
action
of
the
wind
could
not
wear
them
out
nor
cause
them
to
drop
off
not
long
after
this
had
happened
i
received
from
deming
a
shipment
of
about
twenty
varieties
of
hickory
scions
while
i
was
preparing
this
material
for
grafting
i
noticed
that
each
variety
could
be
readily
distinguished
by
its
appearance
in
general
and
specifically
by
differences
in
its
leaf
scars
i
also
noticed
markings
on
the
bark
particularly
the
stomata
which
differed
with
each
variety
color
and
stripes
added
further
differentiation
although
i
also
found
variations
in
the
size
and
shape
of
the
buds
i
later
discovered
that
these
do
not
always
remain
constant
within
a
variety
but
depend
somewhat
on
each
season
growth
for
instance
a
second
growth
sometimes
develops
during
a
favorable
season
with
a
large
number
of
lateral
buds
growing
out
of
it
like
spines
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
scions
could
be
maintained
in
an
approximately
fresh
state
they
would
furnish
a
key
by
which
any
variety
of
graft
could
be
determined
as
easily
as
it
could
by
its
nuts
i
therefore
set
myself
to
preserve
scionwood
in
its
fresh
state
first
i
cut
pieces
of
plump
healthy
wood
each
piece
having
a
terminal
bud
i
placed
these
buds
downward
in
large
test
tubes
which
i
then
filled
with
pure
strained
honey
such
models
did
very
well
for
a
time
but
after
about
a
year
the
honey
crystallized
and
of
course
the
scions
were
no
longer
visible
i
emptied
the
tubes
and
washed
them
cleaned
the
scions
in
warm
water
replaced
them
and
refilled
the
tubes
with
pure
glycerine
i
submerged
a
thin
zinc
tag
stencilled
with
the
varietal
name
and
bent
to
conform
with
the
contour
of
the
tube
inside
of
each
one
as
a
name
plate
which
could
not
easily
be
lost
or
removed
i
also
labeled
each
cork
with
the
name
of
the
variety
enclosed
so
that
any
one
of
them
could
be
located
when
looking
down
at
a
nest
of
tubes
in
a
vertical
position
in
order
to
display
these
preserved
specimens
at
illustrated
lectures
i
had
a
rack
made
of
redwood
of
a
size
to
hold
twenty
tubes
the
tubes
could
easily
be
taken
from
the
rack
for
closer
observation
by
members
of
an
audience
i
find
this
to
be
an
interesting
adjunct
to
various
nut
culture
exhibits
i
make
in
trying
to
promote
nut
culture
education
since
i
was
able
to
identify
my
unlabeled
hickory
grafts
by
means
of
this
catalogue
of
submerged
scions
i
consider
it
of
great
practical
worth
at
the
present
time
i
have
about
hickory
specimens
a
good
catalogue
although
not
a
complete
one
i
see
no
reason
why
the
same
thing
could
not
be
done
with
black
walnut
or
any
other
kind
of
nut
scions
chapter
hybridizing
working
with
nature
to
develop
new
varieties
of
trees
is
fascinating
although
it
requires
infinite
patience
and
study
combined
with
skill
and
concentration
a
person
without
experience
may
taste
of
this
pleasure
however
by
trying
his
hand
at
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
number
of
hybrids
possible
in
attempting
to
make
crosses
one
must
necessarily
understand
the
botanical
relationship
between
the
trees
to
be
crossed
trees
of
the
same
species
cross
readily
in
almost
all
cases
trees
of
the
same
genus
are
not
as
easily
crossed
trees
belonging
only
to
the
same
family
are
usually
difficult
to
cross
it
is
generally
assumed
that
trees
not
in
the
same
family
are
impossible
to
hybridize
the
plum
serves
as
a
practical
example
of
this
the
american
wild
plum
crosses
readily
with
almost
any
other
plum
and
particularly
well
with
the
japanese
plum
these
crosses
have
resulted
in
such
phenomenal
fruit
as
the
underwood
plum
a
cross
made
between
species
if
a
cross
were
made
between
a
chestnut
and
a
walnut
it
would
be
between
members
of
different
families
i
recommend
to
anyone
who
is
attempting
to
for
the
first
time
that
he
limit
his
work
to
crosses
made
within
species
his
chances
of
success
will
be
greater
and
such
success
added
to
the
experience
he
is
acquiring
will
give
him
the
background
needed
for
more
difficult
hybridizing
crosses
made
between
filberts
and
hazels
usually
produce
great
changes
in
the
resulting
fruit
jones
won
considerable
horticultural
fame
from
crosses
he
made
between
the
wild
american
hazel
known
as
the
rush
hazel
and
such
varieties
of
the
european
filbert
as
the
italian
red
and
daviana
hazel
and
filbert
cross
readily
and
the
resulting
seedlings
will
usually
bear
after
only
three
or
four
years
for
both
these
reasons
they
are
good
material
for
a
beginner
to
work
with
if
the
wild
hazel
is
to
be
used
as
the
female
or
mother
of
the
cross
it
is
necessary
to
pick
off
all
the
male
blossoms
or
staminate
blooms
this
should
be
done
long
before
they
begin
to
expand
the
pistillate
or
female
blossoms
should
be
enclosed
in
bags
about
six
of
the
common
kraft
bags
should
be
enough
these
are
slipped
over
those
branches
which
bear
female
blossoms
and
are
tied
around
a
heavy
packing
of
absorbent
cotton
which
has
been
wound
around
the
branch
at
approximately
the
place
where
the
opening
of
the
bag
will
be
in
fastening
the
mouth
of
the
bag
around
the
cotton
i
find
that
no
copper
wire
wrapped
several
times
around
and
the
ends
twisted
together
is
more
satisfactory
than
string
this
makes
a
house
for
the
pistillate
blossoms
but
not
one
so
as
to
cause
any
damage
to
either
the
plant
or
blossoms
in
order
to
have
pollen
available
at
the
proper
time
it
is
necessary
to
cut
a
few
filbert
branches
which
bear
staminate
blooms
and
store
them
in
a
dark
cold
place
to
prevent
the
pollen
from
ripening
too
soon
i
recommend
keeping
such
branches
in
dampened
sphagnum
moss
until
it
is
time
for
the
pollen
to
ripen
or
if
a
cold
cellar
is
available
burying
the
cut
ends
of
large
branches
carrying
male
catkins
one
foot
deep
in
clean
moist
sand
when
the
pollen
is
wanted
the
branches
should
be
placed
in
a
container
of
water
and
set
near
a
window
where
sunlight
will
reach
them
usually
after
one
day
of
exposure
to
bright
sunlight
the
staminate
blooms
will
expand
and
begin
to
shed
their
pollen
the
pollen
may
easily
be
collected
by
allowing
an
extended
catkin
to
droop
inside
a
vial
or
test
tube
and
then
as
the
catkin
rests
against
its
inner
wall
tapping
the
outside
of
the
tube
sharply
with
a
pencil
to
jar
the
pollen
grains
loose
a
separate
test
tube
must
be
used
for
each
variety
of
pollen
to
be
experimented
with
by
following
this
procedure
for
several
days
with
all
the
staminate
blooms
that
have
been
gathered
the
experimenter
should
have
enough
pollen
for
work
on
a
small
scale
the
test
tubes
containing
this
pollen
should
never
be
stoppered
with
corks
but
with
plugs
of
absorbent
cotton
which
will
allow
the
passage
of
air
pollen
may
be
stored
in
this
manner
for
several
days
possibly
as
long
as
two
weeks
if
it
is
kept
dry
by
a
close
observation
of
the
blooming
period
of
the
wild
hazels
one
is
able
to
determine
the
best
time
for
placing
the
filbert
pollen
on
the
pistillate
blossoms
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
do
so
until
the
male
catkins
of
the
wild
hazel
species
are
so
entirely
exhausted
that
no
amount
of
shaking
will
release
any
grains
of
pollen
when
this
condition
exists
it
is
time
to
move
the
stored
filbert
branches
to
strong
sunlight
a
quiet
day
should
be
chosen
to
pollinize
the
hazels
for
two
reasons
if
there
is
a
wind
it
will
blow
away
the
pollen
and
so
make
the
work
more
difficult
a
wind
will
also
increase
the
danger
of
the
hazels
being
fertilized
by
native
hazel
pollen
which
may
still
be
circulating
in
the
air
and
which
the
flowers
may
prefer
to
filbert
pollen
when
good
conditions
are
present
then
the
hybridizer
proceeds
to
his
work
a
brush
with
which
to
transfer
pollen
from
the
vial
to
the
pistillate
blossoms
is
made
by
wrapping
a
little
absorbent
cotton
around
the
end
of
a
match
the
paper
bag
is
removed
from
around
a
group
of
hazel
blossoms
a
small
amount
of
pollen
is
dabbed
on
each
blossom
and
the
bag
is
immediately
replaced
to
remain
on
for
two
more
weeks
when
the
bags
are
finally
taken
off
the
branches
should
be
marked
to
indicate
that
the
nuts
will
be
hybrids
before
receiving
pollen
each
pistillate
blossom
has
emerging
from
its
bud
tip
a
few
delicate
red
or
pink
spikes
which
are
sticky
enough
to
make
pollen
adhere
to
them
within
a
few
days
after
receiving
pollen
these
spikes
may
dry
up
and
turn
black
a
fair
indication
that
the
pollen
has
been
effective
if
the
pollen
does
not
take
hold
the
spikes
of
the
staminate
blooms
are
sure
to
continue
pink
for
a
long
time
i
have
seen
them
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
still
blooming
and
waiting
for
pollen
which
would
let
them
continue
on
their
cycle
this
ability
of
hazel
flowers
to
remain
receptive
for
a
long
period
allows
the
ample
time
to
accomplish
his
work
it
is
not
so
true
with
all
members
of
the
nut
tree
group
some
such
as
the
english
walnuts
being
receptive
for
such
a
short
period
that
only
by
very
frequent
examination
and
many
applications
of
pollen
can
one
be
sure
of
making
a
cross
early
in
the
fall
the
hybrid
nuts
should
be
enclosed
in
a
wire
screen
to
prevent
mice
and
squirrels
from
taking
them
before
they
are
ripe
such
wire
screens
may
be
used
in
the
form
of
a
bag
and
fastened
around
each
branch
when
the
husks
turn
brown
and
dry
the
nuts
are
ripe
and
ready
to
be
gathered
and
planted
careful
handling
of
the
nuts
is
advisable
to
preserve
their
viability
they
should
be
planted
in
an
outdoor
bed
which
has
been
fully
protected
against
the
invasion
of
rodents
a
screen
such
as
i
described
for
other
nut
seed
is
satisfactory
for
these
hybrid
nuts
but
it
need
not
be
as
large
as
that
after
the
nuts
have
sprouted
and
the
plants
have
grown
for
one
season
they
may
be
transplanted
into
a
permanent
location
where
they
should
again
be
well
protected
against
mice
by
a
trunk
screen
and
against
rabbits
by
driving
a
stout
stake
deep
into
the
ground
on
the
south
side
of
the
tree
and
tying
it
to
the
tree
this
use
of
a
stake
discourages
rabbits
from
cutting
off
the
tree
there
are
innumerable
other
crosses
that
can
be
made
as
well
as
those
between
hazels
and
filberts
it
is
possible
for
example
to
cross
the
english
walnut
with
the
black
walnut
many
such
crosses
have
been
made
although
none
of
them
is
known
to
have
produced
superior
nuts
thousands
of
crosses
exist
between
butternuts
and
japanese
heartnuts
many
of
these
are
of
some
worth
and
are
being
propagated
crosses
between
heartnut
and
butternut
are
easily
made
following
the
same
procedure
used
in
crossing
hazels
and
filberts
except
that
larger
bags
are
necessary
for
covering
the
female
blossoms
also
these
bags
should
have
a
small
celluloid
window
glued
into
a
convenient
place
so
that
the
progress
of
the
female
blossoms
toward
maturity
can
be
observed
when
hybridizing
walnuts
it
is
necessary
to
use
a
pollen
gun
instead
of
removing
the
bag
from
around
the
female
blossoms
and
applying
the
pollen
with
a
applicator
such
a
pollen
gun
can
be
made
by
using
a
glass
vial
which
does
not
hold
more
than
an
ounce
of
liquid
an
atomizer
bulb
attached
to
a
short
copper
or
brass
tube
soldered
into
a
metal
is
fitted
to
the
vial
another
small
copper
or
brass
tube
should
also
be
inserted
in
the
close
to
the
first
one
the
second
tube
should
be
bent
to
a

toxicity
among
trees
and
plants
although
quack
grass
will
grow
luxuriantly
up
to
the
trunks
of
both
black
walnut
and
butternut
trees
i
know
from
things
i
have
seen
myself
that
the
roots
of
the
latter
and
probably
of
the
former
have
a
deadly
effect
on
members
of
the
evergreen
family
i
have
seen
northern
white
pine
and
other
pines
too
suddenly
lose
their
needles
and
die
when
as
large
trees
they
have
been
transplanted
to
the
vicinity
of
butternut
trees
to
save
as
many
of
these
transplanted
trees
as
possible
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
sacrifice
almost
one
hundred
fine
butternut
trees
by
cutting
them
off
close
to
the
ground
and
pruning
all
the
sprouts
that
started
other
instances
have
also
demonstrated
to
me
this
deleterious
power
of
butternut
trees
over
evergreens
for
years
i
watched
a
struggle
between
a
small
butternut
tree
and
a
large
mugho
pine
gradually
the
mugho
pine
was
succumbing
at
last
when
the
pine
had
lost
over
half
its
branches
on
the
side
near
the
butternut
i
decided
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
fight
i
cut
off
the
trunk
of
the
butternut
and
pruned
off
all
of
its
sprouts
the
butternut
surrendered
and
died
the
mugho
pine
took
new
heart
lived
and
again
flourished
at
another
time
i
transplanted
several
thousand
montana
pines
about
thirty
or
forty
of
which
came
within
the
branch
limits
of
a
medium
size
butternut
tree
within
a
year
these
thirty
or
more
trees
had
turned
brown
and
were
completely
dead
while
those
immediately
outside
the
branch
area
were
dwarfed
and
not
at
all
thrifty
the
trees
farther
from
the
butternut
were
unaffected
and
grew
consistently
well
a
similar
condition
although
not
to
the
same
degree
developed
under
a
white
oak
where
more
mugho
pines
were
growing
another
instance
occurred
when
a
planting
of
several
thousand
colorado
blue
spruce
were
lined
out
and
fell
within
the
area
affected
by
two
butternut
trees
the
spruce
were
all
dead
within
a
few
months
many
people
have
observed
the
detrimental
effect
of
trees
of
the
walnut
family
on
alfalfa
tomatoes
and
potatoes
resulting
in
wilting
and
dying
it
is
the
root
systems
of
the
walnut
which
are
responsible
for
this
damage
apparently
there
is
some
chemical
elaborated
near
the
surface
of
the
roots
and
sensitive
plants
whose
roots
come
in
contact
with
either
roots
or
ground
containing
this
factor
are
injured
and
sometimes
killed
by
it
one
must
therefore
be
very
cautious
about
trusting
these
trees
as
protectors
of
many
of
the
ornamental
and
garden
plants
i
am
certain
from
my
own
observations
that
their
influence
on
evergreens
is
strongly
antagonistic
on
another
basis
is
the
association
between
catalpas
and
chestnut
trees
growing
adjacent
to
one
another
constructive
symbiosis
apparently
develops
when
a
young
chestnut
tree
is
planted
within
the
radius
of
the
root
system
of
a
catalpa
the
latter
very
definitely
influences
the
chestnut
tree
to
grow
more
vigorously
than
it
otherwise
would
i
have
recorded
my
observations
of
these
antagonisms
and
friendships
between
trees
and
plants
to
show
that
they
are
a
reality
which
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
grouping
and
transplanting
such
warnings
are
infrequent
because
some
people
may
mistake
them
as
condemnations
of
certain
favorite
trees
i
do
not
intend
them
as
such
for
these
plants
are
often
valuable
and
worthwhile
this
ability
which
they
have
developed
through
the
many
years
of
their
existence
is
a
guarantee
of
the
sturdiness
and
strength
of
their
family
and
species
not
at
all
a
quality
to
be
condemned
conclusion
if
i
had
written
this
book
twenty
years
ago
i
would
have
prophesied
a
future
for
nut
culture
in
the
north
full
of
wonder
hope
and
profit
if
i
had
written
it
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
filled
it
with
discouragement
and
disillusion
now
after
growing
such
trees
for
more
than
years
i
realize
that
the
truth
lies
somewhere
between
these
extremes
but
nearer
the
first
it
is
seldom
practical
to
move
native
trees
very
far
from
their
natural
range
nor
is
it
necessary
to
do
so
in
this
part
of
the
north
we
have
four
fine
native
nut
trees
the
hazel
the
butternut
the
black
walnut
and
the
hickory
in
my
experience
these
four
have
completely
demonstrated
their
practical
worth
if
commercialization
is
the
primary
hope
of
the
nut
tree
planter
he
should
first
consider
the
large
hardy
hybrids
known
as
hazilberts
which
i
have
produced
between
a
large
wisconsin
wild
hazel
and
european
filberts
hazilberts
equal
the
best
european
filberts
in
every
way
without
the
latter
disadvantage
of
susceptibility
to
hazel
blight
and
its
lack
of
hardiness
they
are
as
hardy
as
the
common
wild
hazel
and
are
more
adaptable
to
environment
and
soil
conditions
than
any
other
native
nut
tree
they
may
be
trained
into
trees
or
allowed
to
grow
as
large
bushes
like
all
other
filberts
and
hazels
they
too
need
companion
plants
for
cross
pollinization
to
obtain
full
crops
of
nuts
the
butternut
is
also
a
very
adaptable
tree
no
one
who
is
acquainted
with
it
questions
the
quality
of
the
butternut
kernel
in
a
good
variety
the
nuts
should
crack
out
in
halves
and
the
kernels
drop
out
readily
so
many
good
varieties
of
black
walnuts
are
being
propagated
i
need
not
say
much
about
them
except
that
many
of
the
best
ones
are
not
practical
for
this
climate
nurserymen
who
grow
them
can
give
the
best
advice
about
varieties
to
anyone
selecting
black
walnuts
for
orchard
planting
hickories
are
the
last
of
these
native
trees
to
be
recommended
from
a
commercial
standpoint
as
they
are
the
most
particular
about
soil
and
climate
however
with
improved
propagation
methods
and
planting
technique
they
should
become
some
day
as
valuable
as
pecan
plantations
have
become
valuable
to
the
south
considering
the
nut
tree
as
a
dooryard
tree
an
ornament
rather
than
a
business
makes
it
possible
to
include
many
more
species
as
suitable
for
growing
in
the
north
for
this
purpose
i
suggest
heartnuts
chestnuts
pecans
and
hiccans
the
heartnut
tree
is
always
one
to
draw
attention
and
interest
picturesque
in
its
leaves
blossoms
and
clusters
of
nuts
last
but
certainly
not
least
in
it
potentialities
is
the
english
walnut
i
am
certain
that
we
shall
have
some
varieties
of
these
which
will
be
hardy
enough
to
plant
in
the
north
when
these
have
been
completely
proven
they
will
be
a
delightful
addition
to
the
number
of
trees
flourishing
here
what
family
would
not
receive
enjoyment
and
satisfaction
from
having
in
its
dooryard
a
gracious
english
walnut
tree
its
spreading
branches
laden
with
nuts
although
the
commercial
aspect
of
producing
hazilberts
is
engrossing
me
at
the
present
time
my
greatest
pleasure
in
nut
culture
still
comes
as
it
always
shall
come
from
actual
work
with
these
trees
it
is
both
a
physical
and
mental
tonic
i
recommend
nut
tree
culture
to
everyone
who
enjoys
spending
his
time
who
is
inspired
by
work
of
a
creative
nature
and
who
appreciates
having
trees
or
even
one
tree

his
own
