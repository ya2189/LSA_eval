of

sojourner
truth
as
she
now
calls
whose
name
originally
was
born
as
near
as
she
can
now
calculate
between
the
years
and
she
was
the
daughter
of
james
and
betsey
slaves
of
one
colonel
ardinburgh
hurley
ulster
county
new
york
colonel
ardinburgh
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
called
low
dutch
of
her
first
master
she
can
give
no
account
as
she
must
have
been
a
mere
infant
when
he
died
and
she
with
her
parents
and
some
ten
or
twelve
other
fellow
human
chattels
became
the
legal
property
of
his
son
charles
ardinburgh
she
distinctly
remembers
hearing
her
father
and
mother
say
that
their
lot
was
a
fortunate
one
as
master
charles
was
the
best
of
the
family
comparatively
speaking
a
kind
master
to
his
slaves
james
and
betsey
having
by
their
faithfulness
docility
and
respectful
behavior
won
his
particular
regard
received
from
him
particular
which
was
a
lot
of
land
lying
back
on
the
slope
of
a
mountain
where
by
improving
the
pleasant
evenings
and
sundays
they
managed
to
raise
a
little
tobacco
corn
or
flax
which
they
exchanged
for
extras
in
the
articles
of
food
or
clothing
for
themselves
and
children
she
has
no
remembrance
that
saturday
afternoon
was
ever
added
to
their
own
time
as
it
is
by
some
masters
in
the
southern
states
accommodations
among
isabella
earliest
recollections
was
the
removal
of
her
master
charles
ardinburgh
into
his
new
house
which
he
had
built
for
a
hotel
soon
after
the
decease
of
his
father
a
cellar
under
this
hotel
was
assigned
to
his
slaves
as
their
sleeping
apartment
the
slaves
he
possessed
of
both
sexes
sleeping
as
is
quite
common
in
a
state
of
slavery
in
the
same
room
she
carries
in
her
mind
to
this
day
a
vivid
picture
of
this
dismal
chamber
its
only
lights
consisting
of
a
few
panes
of
glass
through
which
she
thinks
the
sun
never
shone
but
with
thrice
reflected
rays
and
the
space
between
the
loose
boards
of
the
floor
and
the
uneven
earth
below
was
often
filled
with
mud
and
water
the
uncomfortable
splashings
of
which
were
as
annoying
as
its
noxious
vapors
must
have
been
chilling
and
fatal
to
health
she
shudders
even
now
as
she
goes
back
in
memory
and
revisits
this
cellar
and
sees
its
inmates
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
sleeping
on
those
damp
boards
like
the
horse
with
a
little
straw
and
a
blanket
and
she
wonders
not
at
the
rheumatisms
and
and
palsies
that
distorted
the
limbs
and
racked
the
bodies
of
those
in
still
she
does
not
attribute
this
cruelty
it
certainly
is
to
be
so
unmindful
of
the
health
and
comfort
of
any
being
leaving
entirely
out
of
sight
his
more
important
part
his
everlasting
interests
much
to
any
innate
or
constitutional
cruelty
of
the
master
as
to
that
gigantic
inconsistency
that
inherited
habit
among
slaveholders
of
expecting
a
willing
and
intelligent
obedience
from
the
slave
because
he
is
a
the
same
time
every
thing
belonging
to
the
system
does
its
best
to
crush
the
last
vestige
of
a
man
within
him
and
when
it
is
crushed
and
often
before
he
is
denied
the
comforts
of
life
on
the
plea
that
he
knows
neither
the
want
nor
the
use
of
them
and
because
he
is
considered
to
be
little
more
or
little
less
than
a
beast
her
brothers
and
sisters
isabella
father
was
very
tall
and
straight
when
young
which
gave
him
the
name
of
dutch
for
least
this
is
sojourner
pronunciation
of
by
this
name
he
usually
went
the
most
familiar
appellation
of
her
mother
was
bett
she
was
the
mother
of
some
ten
or
twelve
children
though
sojourner
is
far
from
knowing
the
exact
number
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
she
being
the
youngest
save
one
and
all
older
than
herself
having
been
sold
before
her
remembrance
she
was
privileged
to
behold
six
of
them
while
she
remained
a
slave
of
the
two
that
immediately
preceded
her
in
age
a
boy
of
five
years
and
a
girl
of
three
who
were
sold
when
she
was
an
infant
she
heard
much
and
she
wishes
that
all
who
would
fain
believe
that
slave
parents
have
not
natural
affection
for
their
offspring
could
have
listened
as
she
did
while
bomefree
and
bett
dark
cellar
lighted
by
a
blazing
sit
for
hours
recalling
and
recounting
every
endearing
as
well
as
harrowing
circumstance
that
taxed
memory
could
supply
from
the
histories
of
those
dear
departed
ones
of
whom
they
had
been
robbed
and
for
whom
their
hearts
still
bled
among
the
rest
they
would
relate
how
the
little
boy
on
the
last
morning
he
was
with
them
arose
with
the
birds
kindled
a
fire
calling
for
his
to
for
all
was
now
ready
for
dreaming
of
the
dreadful
separation
which
was
so
near
at
hand
but
of
which
his
parents
had
an
uncertain
but
all
the
more
cruel
foreboding
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
and
a
large
sleigh
was
seen
to
drive
up
to
the
door
of
the
late
ardinburgh
this
event
was
noticed
with
childish
pleasure
by
the
unsuspicious
boy
but
when
he
was
taken
and
put
into
the
sleigh
and
saw
his
little
sister
actually
shut
and
locked
into
the
sleigh
box
his
eyes
were
at
once
opened
to
their
intentions
and
like
a
frightened
deer
he
sprang
from
the
sleigh
and
running
into
the
house
concealed
himself
under
a
bed
but
this
availed
him
little
he
was
to
the
sleigh
and
separated
for
ever
from
those
whom
god
had
constituted
his
natural
guardians
and
protectors
and
who
should
have
found
him
in
return
a
stay
and
a
staff
to
them
in
their
declining
years
but
i
make
no
comments
on
facts
like
these
knowing
that
the
heart
of
every
slave
parent
will
make
its
own
comments
involuntarily
and
correctly
as
soon
as
each
heart
shall
make
the
case
its
own
those
who
are
not
parents
will
draw
their
conclusions
from
the
promptings
of
humanity
and
philanthropy
enlightened
by
reason
and
revelation
are
also
unerring
her
religious
instruction
isabella
and
peter
her
youngest
brother
remained
with
their
parents
the
legal
property
of
charles
ardinburgh
till
his
decease
which
took
place
when
isabella
was
near
nine
years
old
after
this
event
she
was
often
surprised
to
find
her
mother
in
tears
and
when
in
her
simplicity
she
inquired
what
makes
you
cry
she
would
answer
my
child
i
am
thinking
of
your
brothers
and
sisters
that
have
been
sold
away
from
me
and
she
would
proceed
to
detail
many
circumstances
respecting
them
but
isabella
long
since
concluded
that
it
was
the
impending
fate
of
her
only
remaining
children
which
her
mother
but
too
well
understood
even
then
that
called
up
those
memories
from
the
past
and
made
them
crucify
her
heart
afresh
in
the
evening
when
her
mother
work
was
done
she
would
sit
down
under
the
sparkling
vault
of
heaven
and
calling
her
children
to
her
would
talk
to
them
of
the
only
being
that
could
effectually
aid
or
protect
them
her
teachings
were
delivered
in
low
dutch
her
only
language
and
translated
into
english
ran
nearly
as
follows
children
there
is
a
god
who
hears
and
sees
you
god
where
does
he
live
asked
the
children
lives
in
the
sky
she
replied
when
you
are
beaten
or
cruelly
treated
or
fall
into
any
trouble
you
must
ask
help
of
him
and
he
will
always
hear
and
help
you
she
taught
them
to
kneel
and
say
the
lord
prayer
she
entreated
them
to
refrain
from
lying
and
stealing
and
to
strive
to
obey
their
masters
at
times
a
groan
would
escape
her
and
she
would
break
out
in
the
language
of
the
lord
how
long
lord
how
long
and
in
reply
to
isabella
ails
you
her
only
answer
was
a
good
deal
ails
ails
me
then
again
she
would
point
them
to
the
stars
and
say
in
her
peculiar
language
are
the
same
stars
and
that
is
the
same
moon
that
look
down
upon
your
brothers
and
sisters
and
which
they
see
as
they
look
up
to
them
though
they
are
ever
so
far
away
from
us
and
each
other
thus
in
her
humble
way
did
she
endeavor
to
show
them
their
heavenly
father
as
the
only
being
who
could
protect
them
in
their
perilous
condition
at
the
same
time
she
would
strengthen
and
brighten
the
chain
of
family
affection
which
she
trusted
extended
itself
sufficiently
to
connect
the
widely
scattered
members
of
her
precious
flock
these
instructions
of
the
mother
were
treasured
up
and
held
sacred
by
isabella
as
our
future
narrative
will
show
the
auction
at
length
the
day
of
the
terrible
auction
arrived
when
the
horses
and
other
cattle
of
charles
ardinburgh
deceased
were
to
be
put
under
the
hammer
and
again
change
masters
not
only
isabella
and
peter
but
their
mother
were
now
destined
to
the
auction
block
and
would
have
been
struck
off
with
the
rest
to
the
highest
bidder
but
for
the
following
circumstance
a
question
arose
among
the
heirs
shall
be
burdened
with
bomefree
when
we
have
sent
away
his
faithful
bett
he
was
becoming
weak
and
infirm
his
limbs
were
painfully
rheumatic
and
from
exposure
and
hardship
than
from
old
age
though
he
was
several
years
older
than
bett
he
was
no
longer
considered
of
value
but
must
soon
be
a
burden
and
care
to
some
one
after
some
contention
on
the
point
at
issue
none
being
willing
to
be
burdened
with
him
it
was
finally
agreed
as
most
expedient
for
the
heirs
that
the
price
of
bett
should
be
sacrificed
and
she
receive
her
freedom
on
condition
that
she
take
care
of
and
support
her
faithful
james
faithful
not
only
to
her
as
a
husband
but
proverbially
faithful
as
a
slave
to
those
who
would
not
willingly
sacrifice
a
dollar
for
his
comfort
now
that
he
had
commenced
his
descent
into
the
dark
vale
of
decrepitude
and
suffering
this
important
decision
was
received
as
joyful
news
indeed
to
our
ancient
couple
who
were
the
objects
of
it
and
who
were
trying
to
prepare
their
hearts
for
a
severe
struggle
and
one
altogether
new
to
them
as
they
had
never
before
been
separated
for
though
ignorant
helpless
crushed
in
spirit
and
weighed
down
with
hardship
and
cruel
bereavement
they
were
still
human
and
their
human
hearts
beat
within
them
with
as
true
an
affection
as
ever
caused
a
human
heart
to
beat
and
their
anticipated
separation
now
in
the
decline
of
life
after
the
last
child
had
been
torn
from
them
must
have
been
truly
appalling
another
privilege
was
granted
of
remaining
occupants
of
the
same
dark
humid
cellar
i
have
before
described
otherwise
they
were
to
support
themselves
as
they
best
could
and
as
her
mother
was
still
able
to
do
considerable
work
and
her
father
a
little
they
got
on
for
some
time
very
comfortably
the
strangers
who
rented
the
house
were
humane
people
and
very
kind
to
them
they
were
not
rich
and
owned
no
slaves
how
long
this
state
of
things
continued
we
are
unable
to
say
as
isabella
had
not
then
sufficiently
cultivated
her
organ
of
time
to
calculate
years
or
even
weeks
or
hours
but
she
thinks
her
mother
must
have
lived
several
years
after
the
death
of
master
charles
she
remembers
going
to
visit
her
parents
some
three
or
four
times
before
the
death
of
her
mother
and
a
good
deal
of
time
seemed
to
her
to
intervene
between
each
visit
at
length
her
mother
health
began
to
made
its
ravages
on
one
of
her
limbs
and
the
palsy
began
to
shake
her
frame
still
she
and
james
tottered
about
picking
up
a
little
here
and
there
which
added
to
the
mites
contributed
by
their
kind
neighbors
sufficed
to
sustain
life
and
drive
famine
from
the
door
death
of
bett
one
morning
in
early
autumn
from
the
reason
above
mentioned
we
can
not
tell
what
year
bett
told
james
she
would
make
him
a
loaf
of
and
get
simmons
their
kind
neighbor
to
bake
it
for
them
as
she
would
bake
that
forenoon
james
told
her
he
had
engaged
to
rake
after
the
cart
for
his
neighbors
that
morning
but
before
he
commenced
he
would
pole
off
some
apples
from
a
tree
near
which
they
were
allowed
to
gather
and
if
she
could
get
some
of
them
baked
with
the
bread
it
would
give
a
nice
relish
for
their
dinner
he
beat
off
the
apples
and
soon
after
saw
bett
come
out
and
gather
them
up
at
the
blowing
of
the
horn
for
dinner
he
groped
his
way
into
his
cellar
anticipating
his
humble
but
warm
and
nourishing
meal
when
lo
instead
of
being
cheered
by
the
sight
and
odor
of
bread
and
the
savory
apples
his
cellar
seemed
more
cheerless
than
usual
and
at
first
neither
sight
nor
sound
met
eye
or
ear
but
on
groping
his
way
through
the
room
his
staff
which
he
used
as
a
pioneer
to
go
before
and
warn
him
of
danger
seemed
to
be
impeded
in
its
progress
and
a
low
gurgling
choking
sound
proceeded
from
the
object
before
him
giving
him
the
first
intimation
of
the
truth
as
it
was
that
bett
his
bosom
companion
the
only
remaining
member
of
his
large
family
had
fallen
in
a
fit
of
the
palsy
and
lay
helpless
and
senseless
on
the
earth
who
among
us
located
in
pleasant
homes
surrounded
with
every
comfort
and
so
many
kind
and
sympathizing
friends
can
picture
to
ourselves
the
dark
and
desolate
state
of
poor
old
weak
lame
and
nearly
blind
as
he
was
at
the
moment
he
found
his
companion
was
removed
from
him
and
he
was
left
alone
in
the
world
with
no
one
to
aid
comfort
or
console
him
for
she
never
revived
again
and
lived
only
a
few
hours
after
being
discovered
senseless
by
her
poor
bereaved
james
last
days
of
bomefree
isabella
and
peter
were
permitted
to
see
the
remains
of
their
mother
laid
in
their
last
narrow
dwelling
and
to
make
their
bereaved
father
a
little
visit
ere
they
returned
to
their
servitude
and
most
piteous
were
the
lamentations
of
the
poor
old
man
when
at
last
they
also
were
obliged
to
bid
him
farewell
juan
fernandes
on
his
desolate
island
was
not
so
pitiable
an
object
as
this
poor
lame
man
blind
and
crippled
he
was
too
superannuated
to
think
for
a
moment
of
taking
care
of
himself
and
he
greatly
feared
no
persons
would
interest
themselves
in
his
behalf
he
would
exclaim
had
thought
god
would
take
me
first
was
so
much
smarter
than
i
and
could
get
about
and
take
care
of
herself
i
am
so
old
and
so
helpless
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
ca
do
anything
any
children
are
all
gone
and
here
i
am
left
helpless
and
alone
then
as
i
was
taking
leave
of
him
said
his
daughter
in
relating
it
raised
his
voice
and
cried
aloud
like
a
how
he
did
cry
i
hear
it
now
remember
it
as
well
as
if
it
were
but
old
man
he
thought
god
had
done
it
my
heart
bled
within
me
at
the
sight
of
his
misery
he
begged
me
to
get
permission
to
come
and
see
him
sometimes
which
i
readily
and
heartily
promised
him
but
when
all
had
left
him
the
ardinburghs
having
some
feeling
left
for
their
faithful
and
favorite
slave
turns
about
in
keeping
permitting
him
to
stay
a
few
weeks
at
one
house
and
then
a
while
at
another
and
so
around
if
when
he
made
a
removal
the
place
where
he
was
going
was
not
too
far
off
he
took
up
his
line
of
march
staff
in
hand
and
asked
for
no
assistance
if
it
was
twelve
or
twenty
miles
they
gave
him
a
ride
while
he
was
living
in
this
way
isabella
was
twice
permitted
to
visit
him
another
time
she
walked
twelve
miles
and
carried
her
infant
in
her
arms
to
see
him
but
when
she
reached
the
place
where
she
hoped
to
find
him
he
had
just
left
for
a
place
some
twenty
miles
distant
and
she
never
saw
him
more
the
last
time
she
did
see
him
she
found
him
seated
on
a
rock
by
the
road
side
alone
and
far
from
any
house
he
was
then
migrating
from
the
house
of
one
ardinburgh
to
that
of
another
several
miles
distant
his
hair
was
white
like
was
almost
his
gait
was
more
a
creep
than
a
the
weather
was
warm
and
pleasant
and
he
did
not
dislike
the
journey
when
isabella
addressed
him
he
recognized
her
voice
and
was
exceeding
glad
to
see
her
he
was
assisted
to
mount
the
wagon
was
carried
back
to
the
famous
cellar
of
which
we
have
spoken
and
there
they
held
their
last
earthly
conversation
he
again
as
usual
bewailed
his
loneliness
in
tones
of
anguish
of
his
many
children
saying
they
are
all
taken
away
from
me
i
have
now
not
one
to
give
me
a
cup
of
cold
should
i
live
and
not
die
isabella
whose
heart
yearned
over
her
father
and
who
would
have
made
any
sacrifice
to
have
been
able
to
be
with
and
take
care
of
him
tried
to
comfort
by
telling
him
that
had
heard
the
white
folks
say
that
all
the
slaves
in
the
state
would
be
freed
in
ten
years
and
that
then
she
would
come
and
take
care
of
him
would
take
just
as
good
care
of
you
as
would
if
she
was
isabel
my
child
replied
he
can
not
live
that
long
do
daddy
do
live
and
i
will
take
such
good
care
of
you
was
her
rejoinder
she
now
says
i
thought
then
in
my
ignorance
that
he
could
live
if
he
would
i
just
as
much
thought
so
as
i
ever
thought
any
thing
in
my
i
insisted
on
his
living
but
he
shook
his
head
and
insisted
he
could
not
but
before
bomefree
good
constitution
would
yield
either
to
age
exposure
or
a
strong
desire
to
die
the
ardinburghs
again
tired
of
him
and
offered
freedom
to
two
old
brother
of
bett
and
his
wife
condition
that
they
should
take
care
of
james
i
was
about
to
say
as
slaves
are
neither
husbands
nor
wives
in
law
the
idea
of
their
being
is
truly
ludicrous
and
although
they
were
too
old
and
infirm
to
take
care
of
themselves
caesar
having
been
afflicted
for
a
long
time
with
and
his
wife
with
the
jaundice
they
eagerly
accepted
the
boon
of
freedom
which
had
been
the
desire
of
their
at
a
time
when
emancipation
was
to
them
little
more
than
destitution
and
was
a
freedom
more
to
be
desired
by
the
master
than
the
slave
sojourner
declares
of
the
slaves
in
their
ignorance
that
thoughts
are
no
longer
than
her
finger
death
of
bomefree
a
rude
cabin
in
a
lone
wood
far
from
any
neighbors
was
granted
to
our
freed
friends
as
the
only
assistance
they
were
now
to
expect
bomefree
from
this
time
found
his
poor
needs
hardly
supplied
as
his
new
providers
were
scarce
able
to
administer
to
their
own
wants
however
the
time
drew
near
when
things
were
to
be
decidedly
worse
rather
than
better
for
they
had
not
been
together
long
before
betty
died
and
shortly
after
caesar
followed
her
to
bourne
from
whence
no
traveller
poor
james
again
desolate
and
more
helpless
than
ever
before
as
this
time
there
was
no
kind
family
in
the
house
and
the
ardinburghs
no
longer
invited
him
to
their
homes
yet
lone
blind
and
helpless
as
he
was
james
for
a
time
lived
on
one
day
an
aged
colored
woman
named
soan
called
at
his
shanty
and
james
besought
her
in
the
most
moving
manner
even
with
tears
to
tarry
awhile
and
wash
and
mend
him
up
so
that
he
might
once
more
be
decent
and
comfortable
for
he
was
suffering
dreadfully
with
the
filth
and
vermin
that
had
collected
upon
him
soan
was
herself
an
emancipated
slave
old
and
weak
with
no
one
to
care
for
her
and
she
lacked
the
courage
to
undertake
a
job
of
such
seeming
magnitude
fearing
she
might
herself
get
sick
and
perish
there
without
assistance
and
with
great
reluctance
and
a
heart
swelling
with
pity
as
she
afterwards
declared
she
felt
obliged
to
leave
him
in
his
wretchedness
and
filth
and
shortly
after
her
visit
this
faithful
slave
this
deserted
wreck
of
humanity
was
found
on
his
miserable
pallet
frozen
and
stiff
in
death
the
kind
angel
had
come
at
last
and
relieved
him
of
the
many
miseries
that
his
had
heaped
upon
him
yes
he
had
died
chilled
and
starved
with
none
to
speak
a
kindly
word
or
do
a
kindly
deed
for
him
in
that
last
dread
of
hour
of
need
the
news
of
his
death
reached
the
ears
of
john
ardinburgh
a
grandson
of
the
old
colonel
and
he
declared
that
who
had
ever
been
a
kind
and
faithful
slave
should
now
have
a
good
funeral
and
now
gentle
reader
what
think
you
constituted
a
good
funeral
black
paint
for
the
coffin
jug
of
ardent
spirits
what
a
compensation
for
a
life
of
toil
of
patient
submission
to
repeated
robberies
of
the
most
aggravated
kind
and
also
far
more
than
murderous
neglect
mankind
often
vainly
attempts
to
atone
for
unkindness
or
cruelty
to
the
living
by
honoring
the
same
after
death
but
john
ardinburgh
undoubtably
meant
his
pot
of
paint
and
jug
of
whisky
should
act
as
an
opiate
on
his
slaves
rather
than
on
his
own
seared
conscience
commencement
of
isabella
trials
in
life
having
seen
the
sad
end
of
her
parents
so
far
as
it
relates
to
this
earthly
life
we
will
return
with
isabella
to
that
memorable
auction
which
threatened
to
separate
her
father
and
mother
a
slave
auction
is
a
terrible
affair
to
its
victims
and
its
incidents
and
consequences
are
graven
on
their
hearts
as
with
a
pen
of
burning
steel
at
this
memorable
time
isabella
was
struck
off
for
the
sum
of
one
hundred
dollars
to
one
john
nealy
of
ulster
county
new
york
and
she
has
an
impression
that
in
this
sale
she
was
connected
with
a
lot
of
sheep
she
was
now
nine
years
of
age
and
her
trials
in
life
may
be
dated
from
this
period
she
says
with
emphasis
the
war
she
could
only
talk
the
nealys
could
only
talk
english
nealy
could
understand
dutch
but
isabel
and
her
mistress
could
neither
of
them
understand
the
language
of
the
this
of
itself
was
a
formidable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
good
understanding
between
them
and
for
some
time
was
a
fruitful
source
of
dissatisfaction
to
the
mistress
and
of
punishment
and
suffering
to
isabella
she
says
they
sent
me
for
a
not
knowing
what
they
meant
perhaps
i
carried
them
and
trammels
then
oh
how
angry
mistress
would
be
with
me
then
she
suffered
with
the
cold
during
the
winter
her
feet
were
badly
frozen
for
want
of
proper
covering
they
gave
her
a
plenty
to
eat
and
also
a
plenty
of
whippings
one
sunday
morning
in
particular
she
was
told
to
go
to
the
barn
on
going
there
she
found
her
master
with
a
bundle
of
rods
prepared
in
the
embers
and
bound
together
with
cords
when
he
had
tied
her
hands
together
before
her
he
gave
her
the
most
cruel
whipping
she
was
ever
tortured
with
he
whipped
her
till
the
flesh
was
deeply
lacerated
and
the
blood
streamed
from
her
the
scars
remain
to
the
present
day
to
testify
to
the
fact
now
she
says
i
hear
tell
of
whipping
women
on
the
bare
flesh
it
makes
my
flesh
crawl
and
my
very
hair
rise
on
my
head
oh
my
god
she
continues
a
way
is
this
of
treating
human
beings
in
those
hours
of
her
extremity
she
did
not
forget
the
instructions
of
her
mother
to
go
to
god
in
all
her
trials
and
every
affliction
and
she
not
only
remembered
but
obeyed
going
to
him
telling
him
asking
him
if
he
thought
it
was
right
and
begging
him
to
protect
and
shield
her
from
her
persecutors
she
always
asked
with
an
unwavering
faith
that
she
should
receive
just
what
she
pleaded
for
now
she
says
it
seems
curious
i
do
not
remember
ever
asking
for
any
thing
but
what
i
got
it
and
i
always
received
it
as
an
answer
to
my
prayers
when
i
got
beaten
i
never
knew
it
long
enough
to
go
beforehand
to
pray
and
i
always
thought
that
if
i
only
had
had
time
to
pray
to
god
for
help
i
should
have
escaped
the
beating
she
had
no
idea
god
had
any
knowledge
of
her
thoughts
save
what
she
told
him
or
heard
her
prayers
unless
they
were
spoken
audibly
and
consequently
she
could
not
pray
unless
she
had
time
and
opportunity
to
go
by
herself
where
she
could
talk
to
god
without
being
overheard
trials
continued
when
she
had
been
at
nealy
several
months
she
began
to
beg
god
most
earnestly
to
send
her
father
to
her
and
as
soon
as
she
commenced
to
pray
she
began
as
confidently
to
look
for
his
coming
and
ere
it
was
long
to
her
great
joy
he
came
she
had
no
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
of
the
troubles
that
weighed
so
heavily
on
her
spirit
while
he
remained
but
when
he
left
she
followed
him
to
the
gate
and
unburdened
her
heart
to
him
inquiring
if
he
could
not
do
something
to
get
her
a
new
and
better
place
in
this
way
the
slaves
often
assist
each
other
by
ascertaining
who
are
kind
to
their
slaves
comparatively
and
then
using
their
influence
to
get
such
an
one
to
hire
or
buy
their
friends
and
masters
often
from
policy
as
well
as
from
latent
humanity
allow
those
they
are
about
to
sell
or
let
to
choose
their
own
places
if
the
persons
they
happen
to
select
for
masters
are
considered
safe
pay
he
promised
to
do
all
he
could
and
they
parted
but
every
day
as
long
as
the
snow
lasted
for
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
at
the
time
she
returned
to
the
spot
where
they
separated
and
walking
in
the
tracks
her
father
had
made
in
the
snow
repeated
her
prayer
that
would
help
her
father
get
her
a
new
and
better
place
a
long
time
had
not
elapsed
when
a
fisherman
by
the
name
of
scriver
appeared
at
nealy
and
inquired
of
isabel
she
would
like
to
go
and
live
with
him
she
eagerly
answered
and
nothing
doubting
but
he
was
sent
in
answer
to
her
prayer
and
she
soon
started
off
with
him
walking
while
he
rode
for
he
had
bought
her
at
the
suggestion
of
her
father
paying
one
hundred
and
five
dollars
for
her
he
also
lived
in
ulster
county
but
some
five
or
six
miles
from
nealy
scriver
besides
being
a
fisherman
kept
a
tavern
for
the
accommodation
of
people
of
his
own
his
was
a
rude
uneducated
family
exceedingly
profane
in
their
language
but
on
the
whole
an
honest
kind
and
people
they
owned
a
large
farm
but
left
it
wholly
unimproved
attending
mainly
to
their
vocations
of
fishing
and
isabella
declares
she
can
ill
describe
the
kind
of
life
she
led
with
them
it
was
a
wild
kind
of
lief
she
was
expected
to
carry
fish
to
hoe
corn
to
bring
roots
and
herbs
from
the
woods
for
beers
go
to
the
strand
for
a
gallon
of
molasses
or
liquor
as
the
case
might
require
and
around
as
she
expresses
it
it
was
a
life
that
suited
her
well
for
the
as
devoid
of
hardship
or
terror
as
it
was
of
improvement
a
need
which
had
not
yet
become
a
want
instead
of
improving
at
this
place
morally
she
retrograded
as
their
example
taught
her
to
curse
and
it
was
here
that
she
took
her
first
oath
after
living
with
them
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
she
was
sold
to
one
john
dumont
for
the
sum
of
seventy
pounds
this
was
in
dumont
lived
in
the
same
county
as
her
former
masters
in
the
town
of
new
paltz
and
she
remained
with
him
till
a
short
time
previous
to
her
emancipation
by
the
state
in
her
standing
with
her
new
master
and
mistress
had
dumont
possessed
that
vein
of
kindness
and
consideration
for
the
slaves
so
perceptible
in
her
husband
character
isabella
would
have
been
as
comfortable
here
as
one
had
best
be
if
one
must
be
a
slave
dumont
had
been
nursed
in
the
very
lap
of
slavery
and
being
naturally
a
man
of
kind
feelings
treated
his
slaves
with
all
the
consideration
he
did
his
other
animals
and
more
perhaps
but
dumont
who
had
been
born
and
educated
in
a
family
and
like
many
others
used
only
to
who
under
the
most
stimulating
of
human
motives
were
willing
to
put
forth
their
every
energy
could
not
have
patience
with
the
creeping
gait
the
dull
understanding
or
see
any
cause
for
the
listless
manners
and
careless
slovenly
habits
of
the
poor
forgetting
that
every
high
and
efficient
motive
had
been
removed
far
from
him
and
that
had
not
his
very
intellect
been
crushed
out
of
him
the
slave
would
find
little
ground
for
aught
but
hopeless
despondency
from
this
source
arose
a
long
series
of
trials
in
the
life
of
our
heroine
which
we
must
pass
over
in
silence
some
from
motives
of
delicacy
and
others
because
the
relation
of
them
might
inflict
undeserved
pain
on
some
now
living
whom
isabel
remembers
only
with
esteem
and
love
therefore
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
if
our
narrative
appears
somewhat
tame
at
this
point
and
may
rest
assured
that
it
is
not
for
want
of
facts
as
the
most
thrilling
incidents
of
this
portion
of
her
life
are
from
various
motives
suppressed
one
comparatively
trifling
incident
she
wishes
related
as
it
made
a
deep
impression
on
her
mind
at
the
as
she
thinks
how
god
shields
the
innocent
and
causes
them
to
triumph
over
their
enemies
and
also
how
she
stood
between
master
and
mistress
in
her
family
dumont
employed
two
white
girls
one
of
whom
named
kate
evinced
a
disposition
to
it
over
isabel
and
in
her
emphatic
language
grind
her
down
her
master
often
shielded
her
from
the
attacks
and
accusations
of
others
praising
her
for
her
readiness
and
ability
to
work
and
these
praises
seemed
to
foster
a
spirit
of
hostility
to
her
in
the
minds
of
dumont
and
her
white
servant
the
latter
of
whom
took
every
opportunity
to
cry
up
her
faults
lessen
her
in
the
esteem
of
her
master
and
increase
against
her
the
displeasure
of
her
mistress
which
was
already
more
than
sufficient
for
isabel
comfort
her
master
insisted
that
she
could
do
as
much
work
as
half
a
dozen
common
people
and
do
it
well
too
whilst
her
mistress
insisted
that
the
first
was
true
only
because
it
ever
came
from
her
hand
but
half
performed
a
good
deal
of
feeling
arose
from
this
difference
of
opinion
which
was
getting
to
rather
an
uncomfortable
height
when
all
at
once
the
potatoes
that
isabel
cooked
for
breakfast
assumed
a
dingy
dirty
look
her
mistress
blamed
her
severely
asking
her
master
to
observe
fine
specimen
of
bell
work
is
the
way
all
her
work
is
done
her
master
scolded
also
this
time
and
commanded
her
to
be
more
careful
in
future
kate
joined
with
zest
in
the
censures
and
was
very
hard
upon
her
isabella
thought
that
she
had
done
all
she
well
could
to
have
them
nice
and
became
quite
distressed
at
their
appearances
and
wondered
what
she
should
do
to
avoid
them
in
this
dilemma
gertrude
dumont
eldest
child
a
good
girl
of
ten
years
who
pitied
isabel
sincerely
when
she
heard
them
all
blame
her
so
unsparingly
came
forward
offering
her
sympathy
and
assistance
and
when
about
to
retire
to
bed
on
the
night
of
isabella
humiliation
she
advanced
to
isabel
and
told
her
if
she
would
wake
her
early
next
morning
she
would
get
up
and
attend
to
her
potatoes
for
her
while
she
isabella
went
to
milking
and
they
would
see
if
they
could
not
have
them
nice
and
not
have
her
word
for
father
and
her
word
for
mother
and
all
of
scolding
so
terribly
isabella
gladly
availed
herself
of
this
kindness
which
touched
her
to
the
heart
amid
so
much
of
an
opposite
spirit
when
isabella
had
put
the
potatoes
over
to
boil
getty
told
her
she
would
herself
tend
the
fire
while
isabel
milked
she
had
not
long
been
seated
by
the
fire
in
performance
of
her
promise
when
kate
entered
and
requested
gertrude
to
go
out
of
the
room
and
do
something
for
her
which
she
refused
still
keeping
her
place
in
the
corner
while
there
kate
came
sweeping
about
the
fire
caught
up
a
chip
lifted
some
ashes
with
it
and
dashed
them
into
the
kettle
now
the
mystery
was
solved
the
plot
discovered
kate
was
working
a
little
too
fast
at
making
her
mistress
words
good
at
showing
that
dumont
and
herself
were
on
the
right
side
of
the
dispute
and
consequently
at
gaining
power
over
isabella
yes
she
was
quite
too
fast
inasmuch
as
she
had
overlooked
the
little
figure
of
justice
which
sat
in
the
comer
with
scales
nicely
balanced
waiting
to
give
all
their
dues
but
the
time
had
come
when
she
was
to
be
overlooked
no
longer
it
was
getty
turn
to
speak
now
poppee
oh
poppee
said
she
has
been
putting
ashes
in
among
the
potatoes
i
saw
her
do
it
look
at
those
that
fell
on
the
outside
of
the
kettle
you
can
now
see
what
made
the
potatoes
so
dingy
every
morning
though
bell
washed
them
clean
and
she
repeated
her
story
to
every
new
comer
till
the
fraud
was
made
as
public
as
the
censure
of
isabella
had
been
her
mistress
looked
blank
and
remained
master
muttered
something
which
sounded
very
like
an
poor
kate
was
so
she
looked
like
a
convicted
criminal
who
would
gladly
have
hid
herself
now
that
the
baseness
was
out
to
conceal
her
mortified
pride
and
deep
chagrin
it
was
a
fine
triumph
for
isabella
and
her
master
and
she
became
more
ambitious
than
ever
to
please
him
and
he
stimulated
her
ambition
by
his
commendation
and
by
boasting
of
her
to
his
friends
telling
them
that
wench
pointing
to
isabel
better
to
me
than
a
she
will
do
a
good
washing
in
the
night
and
be
ready
in
the
morning
to
go
into
the
field
where
she
will
do
as
much
at
raking
and
binding
as
my
best
hands
her
ambition
and
desire
to
please
were
so
great
that
she
often
worked
several
nights
in
succession
sleeping
only
short
snatches
as
she
sat
in
her
chair
and
some
nights
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
take
any
sleep
save
what
she
could
get
resting
herself
against
the
wall
fearing
that
if
she
sat
down
she
would
sleep
too
long
these
extra
exertions
to
please
and
the
praises
consequent
upon
them
brought
upon
her
head
the
envy
of
her
and
they
taunted
her
with
being
the
nigger
on
the
other
hand
she
received
the
larger
share
of
the
confidence
of
her
master
and
many
small
favors
that
were
by
them
unattainable
i
asked
her
if
her
master
dumont
ever
whipped
her
she
answered
yes
he
sometimes
whipped
me
soundly
though
never
cruelly
and
the
most
severe
whipping
he
ever
give
me
was
because
i
was
cruel
to
a
cat
at
this
time
she
looked
upon
her
master
as
a
god
and
believed
that
he
knew
of
and
could
see
her
at
all
times
even
as
god
himself
and
she
used
sometimes
to
confess
her
delinquencies
from
the
conviction
that
he
already
knew
them
and
that
she
should
fare
better
if
she
confessed
voluntarily
and
if
any
one
talked
to
her
of
the
injustice
of
her
being
a
slave
she
answered
them
with
contempt
and
immediately
told
her
master
she
then
firmly
believed
that
slavery
was
right
and
honorable
yet
she
now
sees
very
clearly
the
false
position
they
were
all
in
both
masters
and
slaves
and
she
looks
back
with
utter
astonishment
at
the
absurdity
of
the
claims
so
arrogantly
set
up
by
the
masters
over
beings
designed
by
god
to
be
as
free
as
kings
and
at
the
perfect
stupidity
of
the
slave
in
admitting
for
one
moment
the
validity
of
these
claims
in
obedience
to
her
mother
instructions
she
had
educated
herself
to
such
a
sense
of
honesty
that
when
she
had
become
a
mother
she
would
sometimes
whip
her
child
when
it
cried
to
her
for
bread
rather
than
give
it
a
piece
secretly
lest
it
should
learn
to
take
what
was
not
its
own
and
the
writer
of
this
knows
from
personal
observation
that
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
feel
it
to
be
a
religious
duty
to
teach
their
slaves
to
be
honest
and
never
to
take
what
is
not
their
own
oh
consistency
art
thou
not
a
jewel
yet
isabella
glories
in
the
fact
that
she
was
faithful
and
true
to
her
master
she
says
made
me
true
to
my
that
it
helped
to
form
in
her
a
character
that
loved
truth
and
hated
a
lie
and
had
saved
her
from
the
bitter
pains
and
fears
that
are
sure
to
follow
in
the
wake
of
insincerity
and
hypocrisy
as
she
advanced
in
years
an
attachment
sprung
up
between
herself
and
a
slave
named
robert
but
his
master
an
englishman
by
the
name
of
catlin
anxious
that
no
one
property
but
his
own
should
be
enhanced
by
the
increase
of
his
slaves
forbade
robert
visits
to
isabella
and
commanded
him
to
take
a
wife
among
his
notwithstanding
this
interdiction
robert
following
the
bent
of
his
inclinations
continued
his
visits
to
isabel
though
very
stealthily
and
as
he
believed
without
exciting
the
suspicion
of
his
master
but
one
saturday
afternoon
hearing
that
bell
was
ill
he
took
the
liberty
to
go
and
see
her
the
first
intimation
she
had
of
his
visit
was
the
appearance
of
her
master
inquiring
she
had
seen
bob
on
her
answering
in
the
negative
he
said
to
her
you
see
him
tell
him
to
take
care
of
himself
for
the
catlins
are
after
him
almost
at
that
instant
bob
made
his
appearance
and
the
first
people
he
met
were
his
old
and
his
young
masters
they
were
terribly
enraged
at
finding
him
there
and
the
eldest
began
cursing
and
calling
upon
his
son
to
down
the
black
rascal
at
the
same
time
they
both
fell
upon
him
like
tigers
beating
him
with
the
heavy
ends
of
their
canes
bruising
and
mangling
his
head
and
face
in
the
most
awful
manner
and
causing
the
blood
which
streamed
from
his
wounds
to
cover
him
like
a
slaughtered
beast
constituting
him
a
most
shocking
spectacle
dumont
interposed
at
this
point
telling
the
ruffians
they
could
no
longer
thus
spill
human
blood
on
his
would
have
niggers
killed
there
the
catlins
then
took
a
rope
they
had
taken
with
them
for
the
purpose
and
tied
bob
hands
behind
him
in
such
a
manner
that
dumont
insisted
on
loosening
the
cord
declaring
that
no
brute
should
be
tied
in
that
manner
where
he
was
and
as
they
led
him
away
like
the
greatest
of
criminals
the
more
humane
dumont
followed
them
to
their
homes
as
protector
and
when
he
returned
he
kindly
went
to
bell
as
he
called
her
telling
her
he
did
not
think
they
would
strike
him
any
more
as
their
wrath
had
greatly
cooled
before
he
left
them
isabella
had
witnessed
this
scene
from
her
window
and
was
greatly
shocked
at
the
murderous
treatment
of
poor
robert
whom
she
truly
loved
and
whose
only
crime
in
the
eye
of
his
persecutors
was
his
affection
for
her
this
beating
and
we
know
not
what
after
treatment
completely
subdued
the
spirit
of
its
victim
for
robert
ventured
no
more
to
visit
isabella
but
like
an
obedient
and
faithful
chattel
took
himself
a
wife
from
the
house
of
his
master
robert
did
not
live
many
years
after
his
last
visit
to
isabel
but
took
his
departure
to
that
country
where
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
and
where
the
oppressor
can
not
molest
isabella
marriage
subsequently
isabella
was
married
to
a
named
thomas
who
had
previously
had
two
wives
one
of
whom
if
not
both
had
been
torn
from
him
and
sold
far
away
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
was
not
only
allowed
but
encouraged
to
take
another
at
each
successive
sale
i
say
it
is
probable
because
the
writer
of
this
knows
from
personal
observation
that
such
is
the
custom
among
slaveholders
at
the
present
day
and
that
in
a
twenty
months
residence
among
them
we
never
knew
any
one
to
open
the
lip
against
the
practice
and
when
we
severely
censured
it
the
slaveholder
had
nothing
to
say
and
the
slave
pleaded
that
under
existing
circumstances
he
could
do
no
better
such
an
abominable
state
of
things
is
silently
tolerated
to
say
the
least
by
it
who
may
and
what
is
that
religion
that
sanctions
even
by
its
silence
all
that
is
embraced
in
the
institution
if
there
can
be
any
thing
more
diametrically
opposed
to
the
religion
of
jesus
than
the
working
of
this
is
as
truly
sanctioned
by
the
religion
of
america
as
are
her
ministers
and
wish
to
be
shown
where
it
can
be
found
we
have
said
isabella
was
married
to
was
after
the
fashion
of
slavery
one
of
the
slaves
performing
the
ceremony
for
them
as
no
true
minister
of
christ
can
perform
as
in
the
presence
of
god
what
he
knows
to
be
a
mere
farce
a
mock
marriage
unrecognised
by
any
civil
law
and
liable
to
be
annulled
any
moment
when
the
interest
or
caprice
of
the
master
should
dictate
with
what
feelings
must
slaveholders
expect
us
to
listen
to
their
horror
of
amalgamation
in
prospect
while
they
are
well
aware
that
we
know
how
calmly
and
quietly
they
contemplate
the
present
state
of
licentiousness
their
own
wicked
laws
have
created
not
only
as
it
regards
the
slave
but
as
it
regards
the
more
privileged
portion
of
the
population
of
the
south
slaveholders
appear
to
me
to
take
the
same
notice
of
the
vices
of
the
slave
as
one
does
of
the
vicious
disposition
of
his
horse
they
are
often
an
inconvenience
further
than
that
they
care
not
to
trouble
themselves
about
the
matter
isabella
as
a
mother
in
process
of
time
isabella
found
herself
the
mother
of
five
children
and
she
rejoiced
in
being
permitted
to
be
the
instrument
of
increasing
the
property
of
her
oppressors
think
dear
reader
without
a
blush
if
you
can
for
one
moment
of
a
mother
thus
willingly
and
with
pride
laying
her
own
children
the
of
her
flesh
on
the
altar
of
sacrifice
to
the
bloody
moloch
but
we
must
remember
that
beings
capable
of
such
sacrifices
are
not
mothers
they
are
only
but
since
that
time
the
subject
of
this
narrative
has
made
some
advances
from
a
state
of
chattelism
towards
that
of
a
woman
and
a
mother
and
she
now
looks
back
upon
her
thoughts
and
feelings
there
in
her
state
of
ignorance
and
degradation
as
one
does
on
the
dark
imagery
of
a
fitful
dream
one
moment
it
seems
but
a
frightful
illusion
again
it
appears
a
terrible
reality
i
would
to
god
it
were
but
a
dreamy
myth
and
not
as
it
now
stands
a
horrid
reality
to
some
three
millions
of
chattelized
human
beings
i
have
already
alluded
to
her
care
not
to
teach
her
children
to
steal
by
her
example
and
she
says
with
groanings
that
can
not
be
written
lord
only
knows
how
many
times
i
let
my
children
go
hungry
rather
than
take
secretly
the
bread
i
liked
not
to
ask
for
all
parents
who
annul
their
preceptive
teachings
by
their
daily
practices
would
do
well
to
profit
by
her
example
another
proof
of
her
master
kindness
of
heart
is
found
in
the
following
fact
if
her
master
came
into
the
house
and
found
her
infant
crying
as
she
could
not
always
attend
to
its
wants
and
the
commands
of
her
mistress
at
the
same
time
he
would
turn
to
his
wife
with
a
look
of
reproof
and
ask
her
why
she
did
not
see
the
child
taken
care
of
saying
most
earnestly
will
not
hear
this
crying
i
ca
bear
it
and
i
will
not
hear
any
child
cry
so
here
bell
take
care
of
this
child
if
no
more
work
is
done
for
a
week
and
he
would
linger
to
see
if
his
orders
were
obeyed
and
not
countermanded
when
isabella
went
to
the
field
to
work
she
used
to
put
her
infant
in
a
basket
tying
a
rope
to
each
handle
and
suspending
the
basket
to
a
branch
of
a
tree
set
another
small
child
to
swing
it
it
was
thus
secure
from
reptiles
and
was
easily
administered
to
and
even
lulled
to
sleep
by
a
child
too
young
for
other
labors
i
was
quite
struck
with
the
ingenuity
of
such
a
as
i
have
sometimes
been
with
the
swinging
hammock
the
native
mother
prepares
for
her
sick
so
much
easier
than
aught
we
have
in
our
more
civilized
homes
easier
for
the
child
because
it
gets
the
motion
without
the
least
jar
and
easier
for
the
nurse
because
the
hammock
is
strung
so
high
as
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
stooping
slaveholder
promises
after
emancipation
had
been
decreed
by
the
state
some
years
before
the
time
fixed
for
its
consummation
isabella
master
told
her
if
she
would
do
well
and
be
faithful
he
would
give
her
papers
one
year
before
she
was
legally
free
by
statute
in
the
year
she
had
a
badly
diseased
hand
which
greatly
diminished
her
usefulness
but
on
the
arrival
of
july
the
time
specified
for
her
receiving
her
papers
she
claimed
the
fulfilment
of
her
master
promise
but
he
refused
granting
it
on
account
as
he
alleged
of
the
loss
he
had
sustained
by
her
hand
she
plead
that
she
had
worked
all
the
time
and
done
many
things
she
was
not
wholly
able
to
do
although
she
knew
she
had
been
less
useful
than
formerly
but
her
master
remained
inflexible
her
very
faithfulness
probably
operated
against
her
now
and
he
found
it
less
easy
than
he
thought
to
give
up
the
profits
of
his
faithful
bell
who
had
so
long
done
him
efficient
service
but
isabella
inwardly
determined
that
she
would
remain
quietly
with
him
only
until
she
had
spun
his
one
hundred
then
she
would
leave
him
taking
the
rest
of
the
time
to
herself
she
says
with
emphasis
that
can
not
be
written
slaveholders
are
terrible
for
promising
to
give
you
this
or
that
or
such
and
such
a
privilege
if
you
will
do
thus
and
so
and
when
the
time
of
fulfilment
comes
and
one
claims
the
promise
they
forsooth
recollect
nothing
of
the
kind
and
you
are
like
as
not
taunted
with
being
a
liar
or
at
best
the
slave
is
accused
of
not
having
performed
his
part
or
condition
of
the
contract
said
she
have
felt
as
if
i
could
not
live
through
the
operation
sometimes
just
think
of
us
so
eager
for
our
pleasures
and
just
foolish
enough
to
keep
feeding
and
feeding
ourselves
up
with
the
idea
that
we
should
get
what
had
been
thus
fairly
promised
and
when
we
think
it
is
almost
in
our
hands
find
ourselves
flatly
denied
just
think
how
could
we
bear
it
why
there
was
charles
brodhead
promised
his
slave
ned
that
when
harvesting
was
over
he
might
go
and
see
his
wife
who
lived
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
off
so
ned
worked
early
and
late
and
as
soon
as
the
harvest
was
all
in
he
claimed
the
promised
boon
his
master
said
he
had
merely
told
him
he
see
if
he
could
go
when
the
harvest
was
over
but
now
he
saw
that
he
could
not
go
but
ned
who
still
claimed
a
positive
promise
on
which
he
had
fully
depended
went
on
cleaning
his
shoes
his
master
asked
him
if
he
intended
going
and
on
his
replying
took
up
a
that
lay
near
him
and
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
head
as
broke
his
skull
killing
him
dead
on
the
spot
the
poor
colored
people
all
felt
struck
down
by
the
blow
ah
and
well
they
might
yet
it
was
but
one
of
a
long
series
of
bloody
and
other
most
effectual
blows
struck
against
their
liberty
and
their
lives
but
to
return
from
our
digression
the
subject
of
this
narrative
was
to
have
been
free
july
but
she
continued
with
her
master
till
the
wool
was
spun
and
the
heaviest
of
the
work
closed
up
when
she
concluded
to
take
her
freedom
into
her
own
hands
and
seek
her
fortune
in
some
other
place
note
no
official
notice
was
taken
of
his
more
than
brutal
murder
her
escape
the
question
in
her
mind
and
one
not
easily
solved
now
was
can
i
get
away
so
as
was
her
usual
custom
she
god
she
was
afraid
to
go
in
the
night
and
in
the
day
every
body
would
see
her
at
length
the
thought
came
to
her
that
she
could
leave
just
before
the
day
dawned
and
get
out
of
the
neighborhood
where
she
was
known
before
the
people
were
much
astir
said
she
fervently
a
good
thought
thank
you
god
for
that
thought
so
receiving
it
as
coming
direct
from
god
she
acted
upon
it
and
one
fine
morning
a
little
before
she
might
have
been
seen
stepping
stealthily
away
from
the
rear
of
master
dumont
house
her
infant
on
one
arm
and
her
wardrobe
on
the
other
the
bulk
and
weight
of
which
probably
she
never
found
so
convenient
as
on
the
present
occasion
a
cotton
handkerchief
containing
both
her
clothes
and
her
provisions
as
she
gained
the
summit
of
a
high
hill
a
considerable
distance
from
her
master
the
sun
offended
her
by
coming
forth
in
all
his
pristine
splendor
she
thought
it
never
was
so
light
before
indeed
she
thought
it
much
too
light
she
stopped
to
look
about
her
and
ascertain
if
her
pursuers
were
yet
in
sight
no
one
appeared
and
for
the
first
time
the
question
came
up
for
settlement
and
to
whom
shall
i
go
in
all
her
thoughts
of
getting
away
she
had
not
once
asked
herself
whither
she
should
direct
her
steps
she
sat
down
fed
her
infant
and
again
turning
her
thoughts
to
god
her
only
help
she
prayed
him
to
direct
her
to
some
safe
asylum
and
soon
it
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
a
man
living
somewhere
in
the
direction
she
had
been
pursuing
by
the
name
of
levi
rowe
whom
she
had
known
and
who
she
thought
would
be
likely
to
befriend
her
she
accordingly
pursued
her
way
to
his
house
where
she
found
him
ready
to
entertain
and
assist
her
though
he
was
then
on
his
he
bade
her
partake
of
the
hospitalities
of
his
house
said
he
knew
of
two
good
places
where
she
might
get
in
and
requested
his
wife
to
show
her
where
they
were
to
be
found
as
soon
as
she
came
in
sight
of
the
first
house
she
recollected
having
seen
it
and
its
inhabitants
before
and
instantly
exclaimed
the
place
for
me
i
shall
stop
there
she
went
there
and
found
the
good
people
of
the
house
and
van
wagener
absent
but
was
kindly
received
and
hospitably
entertained
by
their
excellent
mother
till
the
return
of
her
children
when
they
arrived
she
made
her
case
known
to
them
they
listened
to
her
story
assuring
her
they
never
turned
the
needy
away
and
willingly
gave
her
employment
she
had
not
been
there
long
before
her
old
master
dumont
appeared
as
she
had
anticipated
for
when
she
took
french
leave
of
him
she
resolved
not
to
go
too
far
from
him
and
not
put
him
to
as
much
trouble
in
looking
her
the
latter
he
was
sure
to
tom
and
jack
had
done
when
they
ran
away
from
him
a
short
time
before
this
was
very
considerate
in
her
to
say
the
least
and
a
proof
that
begets
like
he
had
often
considered
her
feelings
though
not
always
and
she
was
equally
considerate
when
her
master
saw
her
he
said
bell
so
you
run
away
from
me
i
did
not
run
away
i
walked
away
by
and
all
because
you
had
promised
me
a
year
of
my
time
his
reply
was
must
go
back
with
me
her
decisive
answer
was
i
wo
go
back
with
you
he
said
i
shall
take
the
child
this
also
was
as
stoutly
negatived
isaac
van
wagener
then
interposed
saying
he
had
never
been
in
the
practice
of
buying
and
selling
slaves
he
did
not
believe
in
slavery
but
rather
than
have
isabella
taken
back
by
force
he
would
buy
her
services
for
the
balance
of
the
which
her
master
charged
twenty
dollars
and
five
in
addition
for
the
child
the
sum
was
paid
and
her
master
dumont
departed
but
not
till
he
had
heard
van
wagener
tell
her
not
to
call
him
is
but
one
master
and
he
who
is
your
master
is
my
master
isabella
inquired
what
she
should
call
him
he
answered
me
isaac
van
wagener
and
my
wife
is
maria
van
wagener
isabella
could
not
understand
this
and
thought
it
a
mighty
change
as
it
most
truly
was
from
a
master
whose
word
was
law
to
simple
isaac
van
wagener
who
was
master
to
no
one
with
these
noble
people
who
though
they
could
not
be
the
masters
of
slaves
were
undoubtedly
a
portion
of
nobility
she
resided
one
year
and
from
them
she
derived
the
name
of
van
wagener
he
being
her
last
master
in
the
eye
of
the
law
and
a
slave
surname
is
ever
the
same
as
his
master
that
is
if
he
is
allowed
to
have
any
other
name
than
tom
jack
or
guffin
slaves
have
sometimes
been
severely
punished
for
adding
their
master
name
to
their
own
but
when
they
have
no
particular
title
to
it
it
is
no
particular
offence
illegal
sale
of
her
son
a
little
previous
to
isabel
leaving
her
old
master
he
had
sold
her
child
a
boy
of
five
years
to
a
gedney
who
took
him
with
him
as
far
as
new
york
city
on
his
way
to
england
but
finding
the
boy
too
small
for
his
service
he
sent
him
back
to
his
brother
solomon
gedney
this
man
disposed
of
him
to
his
sister
husband
a
wealthy
planter
by
the
name
of
fowler
who
took
him
to
his
own
home
in
alabama
this
illegal
and
fraudulent
transaction
had
been
perpetrated
some
months
before
isabella
knew
of
it
as
she
was
now
living
at
van
wagener
the
law
expressly
prohibited
the
sale
of
any
slave
out
of
the
state
all
minors
were
to
be
free
at
years
of
age
and
dumont
had
sold
peter
with
the
express
understanding
that
he
was
soon
to
return
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
be
emancipated
at
the
specified
time
when
isabel
heard
that
her
son
had
been
sold
south
she
immediately
started
on
foot
and
alone
to
find
the
man
who
had
thus
dared
in
the
face
of
all
law
human
and
divine
to
sell
her
child
out
of
the
state
and
if
possible
to
bring
him
to
account
for
the
deed
arriving
at
new
paltz
she
went
directly
to
her
former
mistress
dumont
complaining
bitterly
of
the
removal
of
her
son
her
mistress
heard
her
through
and
then
a
fine
fuss
to
make
about
a
little
nigger
why
have
you
as
many
of
left
as
you
can
see
to
and
take
care
of
a
pity
is
the
niggers
are
not
all
in
guinea
making
such
a
about
the
neighborhood
and
all
for
a
paltry
nigger
isabella
heard
her
through
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
answered
in
tones
of
deep
have
my
child
again
your
child
again
repeated
her
tones
big
with
contempt
and
scorning
the
absurd
idea
of
her
getting
him
can
you
get
him
and
what
have
you
to
support
him
with
if
you
could
have
you
any
money
answered
bell
have
no
money
but
god
has
enough
or
what
better
and
i
have
my
child
again
these
words
were
pronounced
in
the
most
slow
solemn
and
determined
measure
and
manner
and
in
speaking
of
it
she
says
my
god
i
know
i
have
him
agin
i
was
sure
god
would
help
me
to
get
him
why
i
felt
so
tall
felt
as
if
the
power
of
a
nation
was
with
me
the
impressions
made
by
isabella
on
her
auditors
when
moved
by
lofty
or
deep
feeling
can
never
be
transmitted
to
paper
to
use
the
words
of
another
till
by
some
daguerrian
act
we
are
enabled
to
transfer
the
look
the
gesture
the
tones
of
voice
in
connection
with
the
quaint
yet
fit
expressions
used
and
the
animation
that
at
such
a
time
pervades
all
she
says
after
leaving
her
mistress
she
called
on
gedney
mother
of
him
who
had
sold
her
boy
who
after
listening
to
her
lamentations
her
grief
being
mingled
with
indignation
at
the
sale
of
her
son
and
her
declaration
that
she
would
have
him
me
what
a
disturbance
to
make
about
your
child
what
is
your
child
better
than
my
child
my
child
is
gone
out
there
and
yours
is
gone
to
live
with
her
to
have
enough
of
every
thing
and
be
treated
like
a
gentleman
and
here
she
laughed
at
isabel
absurd
fears
as
she
would
represent
them
to
be
said
isabel
child
has
gone
there
but
she
is
married
and
my
boy
has
gone
as
a
slave
and
he
is
too
little
to
go
so
far
from
his
mother
oh
i
must
have
my
child
and
here
the
continued
laugh
of
seemed
to
isabel
in
this
time
of
anguish
and
distress
almost
demoniacal
and
well
it
was
for
gedney
that
at
that
time
she
could
not
even
dream
of
the
awful
fate
awaiting
her
own
beloved
daughter
at
the
hands
of
him
whom
she
had
chosen
as
worthy
the
wealth
of
her
love
and
confidence
and
in
whose
society
her
young
heart
had
calculated
on
a
happiness
purer
and
more
elevated
than
was
ever
conferred
by
a
kingly
crown
but
alas
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
as
we
shall
relate
by
and
by
at
this
point
isabella
earnestly
begged
of
god
that
he
would
show
to
those
about
her
that
he
was
her
helper
and
she
adds
in
narrating
he
did
or
if
he
did
not
show
them
he
did
me
it
is
often
darkest
just
before
dawn
this
homely
proverb
was
illustrated
in
the
case
of
our
sufferer
for
at
the
period
at
which
we
have
arrived
in
our
narrative
to
her
the
darkness
seemed
palpable
and
the
waters
of
affliction
covered
her
soul
yet
light
was
about
to
break
in
upon
her
soon
after
the
scenes
related
in
our
last
chapter
which
had
harrowed
up
her
very
soul
to
agony
she
met
a
man
we
would
like
to
tell
you
who
dear
reader
but
it
would
be
doing
him
no
kindness
even
at
the
present
day
to
do
so
who
evidently
sympathized
with
her
and
counselled
her
to
go
to
the
quakers
telling
her
they
were
already
feeling
very
indignant
at
the
fraudulent
sale
of
her
son
and
assuring
her
that
they
would
readily
assist
her
and
direct
her
what
to
do
he
pointed
out
to
her
two
houses
where
lived
some
of
those
people
who
formerly
more
than
any
other
sect
perhaps
lived
out
the
principles
of
the
gospel
of
christ
she
wended
her
way
to
their
dwellings
was
listened
to
unknown
as
she
personally
was
to
them
with
patience
and
soon
gained
their
sympathies
and
active
they
gave
her
lodgings
for
the
night
and
it
is
very
amusing
to
hear
her
tell
of
the
high
clean
white
beautiful
assigned
her
to
sleep
in
which
contrasted
so
strangely
with
her
former
pallets
that
she
sat
down
and
contemplated
it
perfectly
absorbed
in
wonder
that
such
a
bed
should
have
been
appropriated
to
one
like
herself
for
some
time
she
thought
that
she
would
lie
down
beneath
it
on
her
usual
bedstead
the
floor
did
indeed
says
she
laughing
heartily
at
her
former
self
however
she
finally
concluded
to
make
use
of
the
bed
for
fear
that
not
to
do
so
might
injure
the
feelings
of
her
good
hostess
in
the
morning
the
quaker
saw
that
she
was
taken
and
set
down
near
kingston
with
directions
to
go
to
the
court
house
and
enter
complaint
to
the
grand
jury
by
a
little
inquiry
she
found
which
was
the
building
she
sought
went
into
the
door
and
taking
the
first
man
she
saw
of
imposing
appearance
for
the
grand
jury
she
commenced
her
complaint
but
he
very
civilly
informed
her
there
was
no
grand
jury
there
she
must
go
up
stairs
when
she
had
with
some
difficulty
ascended
the
flight
through
the
crowd
that
filled
them
she
again
turned
to
the
looking
man
she
could
select
telling
him
she
had
come
to
enter
a
complaint
to
the
grand
jury
for
his
own
amusement
he
inquired
what
her
complaint
was
but
when
he
saw
it
was
a
serious
matter
he
said
to
her
is
no
place
to
enter
a
in
there
pointing
in
a
particular
direction
she
then
went
in
where
she
found
the
grand
jurors
indeed
sitting
and
again
commenced
to
relate
her
injuries
after
holding
some
conversation
among
themselves
one
of
them
rose
and
bidding
her
follow
him
led
the
way
to
a
side
office
where
he
heard
her
story
and
asked
her
she
could
swear
that
the
child
she
spoke
of
was
her
son
she
answered
swear
it
my
son
stop
said
the
lawyer
must
swear
by
this
her
a
book
which
she
thinks
must
have
been
the
bible
she
took
it
and
putting
it
to
her
lips
began
again
to
swear
it
was
her
child
the
clerks
unable
to
preserve
their
gravity
any
longer
burst
into
an
uproarious
laugh
and
one
of
them
inquired
of
lawyer
chip
of
what
use
it
could
be
to
make
her
swear
will
answer
the
law
replied
the
officer
he
then
made
her
comprehend
just
what
he
wished
her
to
do
and
she
took
a
lawful
oath
as
far
as
the
outward
ceremony
could
make
it
one
all
can
judge
how
far
she
understood
its
spirit
and
meaning
he
now
gave
her
a
writ
directing
her
to
take
it
to
the
constable
at
new
paltz
and
have
him
serve
it
on
solomon
gedney
she
obeyed
walking
or
rather
trotting
in
her
haste
some
eight
or
nine
miles
but
while
the
constable
through
mistake
served
the
writ
on
a
brother
of
the
real
culprit
solomon
gedney
slipped
into
a
boat
and
was
nearly
across
the
north
river
on
whose
banks
they
were
standing
before
the
dull
dutch
constable
was
aware
of
his
mistake
solomon
gedney
meanwhile
consulted
a
lawyer
who
advised
him
to
go
to
alabama
and
bring
back
the
boy
otherwise
it
might
cost
him
fourteen
years
imprisonment
and
a
thousand
dollars
in
cash
by
this
time
it
is
hoped
he
began
to
feel
that
selling
slaves
unlawfully
was
not
so
good
a
business
as
he
had
wished
to
find
it
he
secreted
himself
till
due
preparations
could
be
made
and
soon
set
sail
for
alabama
steamboats
and
railroads
had
not
then
annihilated
distance
to
the
extent
they
now
have
and
although
he
left
in
the
fall
of
the
year
spring
came
ere
he
returned
bringing
the
boy
with
holding
on
to
him
as
his
property
it
had
ever
been
isabella
prayer
not
only
that
her
son
might
be
returned
but
that
he
should
be
delivered
from
bondage
and
into
her
own
hands
lest
he
should
be
punished
out
of
mere
spite
to
her
who
was
so
greatly
annoying
and
irritating
to
her
oppressors
and
if
her
suit
was
gained
her
very
triumph
would
add
vastly
to
their
irritation
she
again
sought
advice
of
esquire
chip
whose
counsel
was
that
the
aforesaid
constable
serve
the
writ
upon
the
right
person
this
being
done
soon
brought
solomon
gedney
up
to
kingston
where
he
gave
bonds
for
his
appearance
at
court
in
the
sum
of
esquire
chip
next
informed
his
client
that
her
case
must
now
lie
over
till
the
next
session
of
the
court
some
months
in
the
future
law
must
take
its
course
said
he
wait
another
court
wait
months
said
the
persevering
mother
long
before
that
time
he
can
go
clear
off
and
take
my
child
with
one
knows
where
i
can
not
wait
i
must
have
him
now
whilst
he
is
to
be
had
said
the
lawyer
very
coolly
he
puts
the
boy
out
of
the
way
he
must
pay
the
half
of
which
will
be
yours
supposing
perhaps
that
would
pay
for
a
of
children
in
the
eye
of
a
slave
who
never
in
all
her
life
called
a
dollar
her
own
but
in
this
instance
he
was
mistaken
in
his
reckoning
she
assured
him
that
she
had
not
been
seeking
money
neither
would
money
satisfy
her
it
was
her
son
and
her
son
alone
she
wanted
and
her
son
she
must
have
neither
could
she
wait
court
not
she
the
lawyer
used
his
every
argument
to
convince
her
that
she
ought
to
be
very
thankful
for
what
they
had
done
for
her
that
it
was
a
great
deal
and
it
was
but
reasonable
that
she
should
now
wait
patiently
the
time
of
the
court
yet
she
never
felt
for
a
moment
like
being
influenced
by
these
suggestions
she
felt
confident
she
was
to
receive
a
full
and
literal
answer
to
her
prayer
the
burden
of
which
had
lord
give
my
son
into
my
hands
and
that
speedily
let
not
the
spoilers
have
him
any
longer
notwithstanding
she
very
distinctly
saw
that
those
who
had
thus
far
helped
her
on
so
kindly
were
wearied
of
her
and
she
feared
god
was
wearied
also
she
had
a
short
time
previous
learned
that
jesus
was
a
saviour
and
an
intercessor
and
she
thought
that
if
jesus
could
but
be
induced
to
plead
for
her
in
the
present
trial
god
would
listen
to
him
though
he
were
wearied
of
her
importunities
to
him
of
course
she
applied
as
she
was
walking
about
scarcely
knowing
whither
she
went
asking
within
herself
will
show
me
any
good
and
lend
a
helping
hand
in
this
matter
she
was
accosted
by
a
perfect
stranger
and
one
whose
name
she
has
never
learned
in
the
following
terms
there
how
do
you
get
along
with
your
boy
do
they
give
him
up
to
you
she
told
him
all
adding
that
now
every
body
was
tired
and
she
had
none
to
help
her
he
said
here
i
tell
you
what
you
better
do
do
you
see
that
stone
house
yonder
pointing
in
a
particular
direction
lawyer
demain
lives
there
and
do
you
go
to
him
and
lay
your
case
before
him
i
think
he
help
you
stick
to
him
do
give
him
peace
till
he
does
i
feel
sure
if
you
press
him
he
do
it
for
you
she
needed
no
further
urging
but
trotted
off
at
her
peculiar
gait
in
the
direction
of
his
house
as
fast
as
possible
she
was
not
encumbered
with
stockings
shoes
or
any
other
heavy
article
of
dress
when
she
had
told
him
her
story
in
her
impassioned
manner
he
looked
at
her
a
few
moments
as
if
to
ascertain
if
he
were
contemplating
a
new
variety
of
the
genus
homo
and
then
told
her
if
she
would
give
him
five
dollars
he
would
get
her
son
for
her
in
hours
she
replied
have
no
money
and
never
had
a
dollar
in
my
life
said
he
you
will
go
to
those
quakers
in
poppletown
who
carried
you
to
court
they
will
help
you
to
five
dollars
in
cash
i
have
no
doubt
and
you
shall
have
your
son
in
hours
from
the
time
you
bring
me
that
sum
she
performed
the
journey
to
poppletown
a
distance
of
some
ten
miles
very
expeditiously
collected
considerable
more
than
the
sum
specified
by
the
barrister
then
shutting
the
money
tightly
in
her
hand
she
trotted
back
and
paid
the
lawyer
a
larger
fee
than
he
had
demanded
when
inquired
of
by
people
what
she
had
done
with
the
overplus
she
answered
i
got
it
for
lawyer
demain
and
i
gave
it
to
they
assured
her
she
was
a
fool
to
do
so
that
she
should
have
kept
all
over
five
dollars
and
purchased
herself
shoes
with
it
i
do
not
want
money
or
clothes
now
i
only
want
my
son
and
if
five
dollars
will
get
him
more
will
surely
get
and
if
the
lawyer
had
returned
it
to
her
she
avers
she
would
not
have
accepted
it
she
was
perfectly
willing
he
should
have
every
coin
she
could
raise
if
he
would
but
restore
her
lost
son
to
her
moreover
the
five
dollars
he
required
were
for
the
remuneration
of
him
who
should
go
after
her
son
and
his
master
and
not
for
his
own
services
the
lawyer
now
renewed
his
promise
that
she
should
have
her
son
in
hours
but
isabella
having
no
idea
of
this
space
of
time
went
several
times
in
a
day
to
ascertain
if
her
son
had
come
once
when
the
servant
opened
the
door
and
saw
her
she
said
in
a
tone
expressive
of
much
surprise
this
woman
come
again
she
then
wondered
if
she
went
too
often
when
the
lawyer
appeared
he
told
her
the
hours
would
not
expire
till
the
next
morning
if
she
would
call
then
she
would
see
her
son
the
next
morning
saw
isabel
at
the
lawyer
door
while
he
was
yet
in
his
bed
he
now
assured
her
it
was
morning
till
noon
and
that
before
noon
her
son
would
be
there
for
he
had
sent
the
famous
styles
after
him
who
would
not
fail
to
have
the
boy
and
his
master
on
hand
in
due
season
either
dead
or
alive
of
that
he
was
sure
telling
her
she
need
not
come
again
he
would
himself
inform
her
of
their
arrival
after
dinner
he
appeared
at
rutzer
a
place
the
lawyer
had
procured
for
her
while
she
awaited
the
arrival
of
her
boy
assuring
her
her
son
had
come
but
that
he
stoutly
denied
having
any
mother
or
any
relatives
in
that
place
and
said
must
go
over
and
identify
him
she
went
to
the
office
but
at
sight
of
her
the
boy
cried
aloud
and
regarded
her
as
some
terrible
being
who
was
about
to
take
him
away
from
a
kind
and
loving
friend
he
knelt
even
and
begged
them
with
tears
not
to
take
him
away
from
his
dear
master
who
had
brought
him
from
the
dreadful
south
and
been
so
kind
to
him
when
he
was
questioned
relative
to
the
bad
scar
on
his
forehead
he
said
horse
hove
him
and
of
the
one
on
his
cheek
was
done
by
running
against
the
carriage
in
answering
these
questions
he
looked
imploringly
at
his
master
as
much
as
to
say
they
are
falsehoods
you
bade
me
say
them
may
they
be
satisfactory
to
you
at
least
the
justice
noting
his
appearance
bade
him
forget
his
master
and
attend
only
to
him
but
the
boy
persisted
in
denying
his
mother
and
clinging
to
his
master
saying
his
mother
did
not
live
in
such
a
place
as
that
however
they
allowed
the
mother
to
identify
her
son
and
esquire
demain
pleaded
that
he
claimed
the
boy
for
her
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
sold
out
of
the
state
contrary
to
the
laws
in
such
cases
made
and
of
the
penalties
annexed
to
said
crime
and
of
the
sum
of
money
the
delinquent
was
to
pay
in
case
any
one
chose
to
prosecute
him
for
the
offence
he
had
committed
isabella
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
thought
within
herself
i
can
but
get
the
boy
the
may
remain
for
whoever
else
chooses
to
have
done
enough
to
make
myself
enemies
she
trembled
at
the
thought
of
the
formidable
enemies
she
had
probably
arrayed
against
and
despised
as
she
was
when
the
pleading
was
at
an
end
isabella
understood
the
judge
to
declare
as
the
sentence
of
the
court
that
the
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
no
other
master
no
other
controller
no
other
conductor
but
his
mother
this
sentence
was
obeyed
he
was
delivered
into
her
hands
the
boy
meanwhile
begging
most
piteously
not
to
be
taken
from
his
dear
master
saying
she
was
not
his
mother
and
that
his
mother
did
not
live
in
such
a
place
as
that
and
it
was
some
time
before
lawyer
demain
the
clerks
and
isabella
could
collectively
succeed
in
calming
the
fears
and
in
convincing
him
that
isabella
was
not
some
terrible
monster
as
he
had
for
the
last
months
probably
been
trained
to
believe
and
who
in
taking
him
away
from
his
master
was
taking
him
from
all
good
and
consigning
him
to
all
evil
when
at
last
kind
words
and
had
quieted
his
fears
and
he
could
listen
to
their
explanations
he
said
to
you
do
look
like
my
mother
used
to
and
she
was
soon
able
to
make
him
comprehend
some
of
the
obligations
he
was
under
and
the
relation
he
stood
in
both
to
herself
and
his
master
she
commenced
as
soon
as
practicable
to
examine
the
boy
and
found
to
her
utter
astonishment
that
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
the
callosities
and
indurations
on
his
entire
body
were
most
frightful
to
behold
his
back
she
described
as
being
like
her
fingers
as
she
laid
them
side
by
side
what
is
all
this
said
isabel
he
answered
is
where
fowler
whipped
kicked
and
beat
me
she
exclaimed
lord
jesus
look
see
my
poor
child
oh
lord
render
unto
them
double
for
all
this
oh
my
god
pete
how
did
you
bear
it
this
is
nothing
you
should
see
phillis
i
guess
you
scare
she
had
a
little
baby
and
fowler
cut
her
till
the
milk
as
well
as
blood
ran
down
her
body
you
would
scare
to
see
phillis
mammy
when
isabella
inquired
did
miss
eliza
say
pete
when
you
were
treated
so
badly
he
replied
mammy
she
said
she
wished
i
was
with
bell
sometimes
i
crawled
under
the
stoop
mammy
the
blood
running
all
about
me
and
my
back
would
stick
to
the
boards
and
sometimes
miss
eliza
would
come
and
grease
my
sores
when
all
were
abed
and
asleep
note
eliza
fowler
death
of
eliza
fowler
as
soon
as
possible
she
procured
a
place
for
peter
as
tender
of
locks
at
a
place
called
wahkendall
near
greenkills
after
he
was
thus
disposed
of
she
visited
her
sister
sophia
who
resided
at
newberg
and
spent
the
winter
in
several
different
families
where
she
was
acquainted
she
remained
some
time
in
the
family
of
a
latin
who
was
a
relative
of
solomon
gedney
and
the
latter
when
he
found
isabel
with
his
cousin
used
all
his
influence
to
persuade
him
she
was
a
great
and
a
very
troublesome
person
she
had
put
him
to
some
hundreds
of
dollars
expense
by
fabricating
lies
about
him
and
especially
his
sister
and
her
family
concerning
her
boy
when
the
latter
was
living
so
like
a
gentleman
with
them
and
for
his
part
he
would
not
advise
his
friends
to
harbor
or
encourage
her
however
his
cousins
the
latins
could
not
see
with
the
eyes
of
his
feelings
and
consequently
his
words
fell
powerless
on
them
and
they
retained
her
in
their
service
as
long
as
they
had
aught
for
her
to
do
she
then
went
to
visit
her
former
master
dumont
she
had
scarcely
arrived
there
when
fred
waring
entered
and
seeing
isabel
pleasantly
accosted
her
and
asked
her
she
was
driving
at
on
her
answering
particular
he
requested
her
to
go
over
to
his
place
and
assist
his
folks
as
some
of
them
were
sick
and
they
needed
an
extra
hand
she
very
gladly
assented
when
retired
her
master
wanted
to
know
why
she
wished
to
help
people
that
called
her
the
of
devils
as
waring
had
done
in
the
he
was
the
uncle
of
solomon
gedney
and
attended
the
trial
we
have
declared
she
was
a
fool
to
he
would
do
it
she
told
him
would
not
mind
that
but
was
very
glad
to
have
people
forget
their
anger
towards
her
she
went
over
but
too
happy
to
feel
that
their
resentment
was
passed
and
commenced
her
work
with
a
light
heart
and
a
strong
will
she
had
not
worked
long
in
this
frame
of
mind
before
a
young
daughter
of
waring
rushed
into
the
rooms
exclaiming
with
uplifted
and
earth
isabella
murdered
cousin
eliza
said
isabel
liked
to
have
killed
my
child
nothing
saved
him
but
god
meaning
that
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
it
for
a
man
whose
heart
was
sufficiently
hardened
to
treat
a
mere
child
as
hers
had
been
treated
was
in
her
opinion
more
fiend
than
human
and
prepared
for
the
commission
of
any
crime
that
his
passions
might
prompt
him
to
the
child
further
informed
her
that
a
letter
had
arrived
by
mail
bringing
the
news
immediately
after
this
announcement
solomon
gedney
and
his
mother
came
in
going
direct
to
waring
room
where
she
soon
heard
tones
as
of
some
one
reading
she
thought
something
said
to
her
inwardly
up
stairs
and
hear
at
first
she
hesitated
but
it
seemed
to
press
her
the
up
and
hear
she
went
up
unusual
as
it
is
for
slaves
to
leave
their
work
and
enter
unbidden
their
mistress
room
for
the
sole
purpose
of
seeing
or
hearing
what
may
be
seen
or
heard
there
but
on
this
occasion
isabella
says
she
walked
in
at
the
door
shut
it
placed
her
back
against
it
and
listened
she
saw
them
and
heard
them
knocked
her
down
with
his
fist
jumped
on
her
with
his
knees
broke
her
and
tore
out
her
he
then
attempted
his
escape
but
was
pursued
and
arrested
and
put
in
an
iron
bank
for
and
the
friends
were
requested
to
go
down
and
take
away
the
poor
innocent
children
who
had
thus
been
made
in
one
short
day
more
than
orphans
if
this
narrative
should
ever
meet
the
eye
of
those
innocent
sufferers
for
another
guilt
let
them
not
be
too
deeply
affected
by
the
relation
but
placing
their
confidence
in
him
who
sees
the
end
from
the
beginning
and
controls
the
results
rest
secure
in
the
faith
that
although
they
may
physically
suffer
for
the
sins
of
others
if
they
remain
but
true
to
themselves
their
highest
and
more
enduring
interests
can
never
suffer
from
such
a
cause
this
relation
should
be
suppressed
for
their
sakes
were
it
not
even
now
so
often
denied
that
slavery
is
fast
undermining
all
true
regard
for
human
life
we
know
this
one
instance
is
not
a
demonstration
to
the
contrary
but
adding
this
to
the
lists
of
tragedies
that
weekly
come
up
to
us
through
the
southern
mails
may
we
not
admit
them
as
proofs
irrefragable
the
newspapers
confirmed
this
account
of
the
terrible
affair
when
isabella
had
heard
the
letter
all
being
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
feelings
to
take
note
of
her
she
returned
to
her
work
her
heart
swelling
with
conflicting
emotions
she
was
awed
at
the
dreadful
deed
she
mourned
the
fate
of
the
loved
eliza
who
had
in
such
an
undeserved
and
barbarous
manner
been
put
away
from
her
labors
and
watchings
as
a
tender
mother
and
though
not
least
in
the
development
of
her
character
and
spirit
her
heart
bled
for
the
afflicted
relatives
even
those
of
them
who
at
her
calamity
and
mocked
when
her
fear
came
her
thoughts
dwelt
long
and
intently
on
the
subject
and
the
wonderful
chain
of
events
that
had
conspired
to
bring
her
that
day
to
that
house
to
listen
to
that
piece
of
that
house
where
she
never
was
before
or
afterwards
in
her
life
and
invited
there
by
people
who
had
so
lately
been
hotly
incensed
against
her
it
all
seemed
very
remarkable
to
her
and
she
viewed
it
as
flowing
from
a
special
providence
of
god
she
thought
she
saw
clearly
that
their
unnatural
bereavement
was
a
blow
dealt
in
retributive
justice
but
she
found
it
not
in
her
heart
to
exult
or
rejoice
over
them
she
felt
as
if
god
had
more
than
answered
her
petition
when
she
ejaculated
in
her
anguish
of
mind
lord
render
unto
them
double
she
said
dared
not
find
fault
with
god
exactly
but
the
language
of
my
heart
was
my
god
that
too
did
not
mean
quite
so
much
god
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
the
friends
of
the
deceased
and
her
selfish
mother
who
said
isabella
made
such
a
about
her
boy
not
from
affection
but
to
have
her
own
will
and
way
went
deranged
and
walking
to
and
fro
in
her
delirium
called
aloud
for
her
poor
murdered
eliza
the
derangement
of
was
a
matter
of
hearsay
as
isabella
saw
her
not
after
the
trial
but
she
has
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
she
heard
isabel
could
never
learn
the
subsequent
fate
of
fowler
but
heard
in
the
spring
of
that
his
children
had
been
seen
in
of
whom
was
spoken
of
as
a
fine
interesting
girl
albeit
a
halo
of
sadness
fell
like
a
veil
about
her
isabella
religious
experience
we
will
now
turn
from
the
outward
and
temporal
to
the
inward
and
spiritual
life
of
our
subject
it
is
ever
both
interesting
and
instructive
to
trace
the
exercises
of
a
human
mind
through
the
trials
and
mysteries
of
life
and
especially
a
naturally
powerful
mind
left
as
hers
was
almost
entirely
to
its
own
workings
and
the
chance
influences
it
met
on
its
way
and
especially
to
note
its
reception
of
that
divine
that
lighteth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
we
see
as
knowledge
dawns
upon
it
truth
and
error
strangely
commingled
here
a
bright
spot
illuminated
by
there
one
darkened
and
distorted
by
error
and
the
state
of
such
a
soul
may
be
compared
to
a
landscape
at
early
dawn
where
the
sun
is
seen
superbly
gilding
some
objects
and
causing
others
to
send
forth
their
lengthened
distorted
and
sometimes
hideous
shadows
her
mother
as
we
have
already
said
talked
to
her
of
god
from
these
conversations
her
incipient
mind
drew
the
conclusion
that
god
was
great
man
greatly
superior
to
other
men
in
power
and
being
located
in
the
sky
could
see
all
that
transpired
on
the
earth
she
believed
he
not
only
saw
but
noted
down
all
her
actions
in
a
great
book
even
as
her
master
kept
a
record
of
whatever
he
wished
not
to
forget
but
she
had
no
idea
that
god
knew
a
thought
of
hers
till
she
had
uttered
it
aloud
as
we
have
before
mentioned
she
had
ever
been
mindful
of
her
mother
injunctions
spreading
out
in
detail
all
her
troubles
before
god
imploring
and
firmly
trusting
him
to
send
her
deliverance
from
them
whilst
yet
a
child
she
listened
to
a
story
of
a
wounded
soldier
left
alone
in
the
trail
of
a
flying
army
helpless
and
starving
who
hardened
the
very
ground
about
him
with
kneeling
in
his
supplications
to
god
for
relief
until
it
arrived
from
this
narrative
she
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
idea
that
if
she
also
were
to
present
her
petitions
under
the
open
canopy
of
heaven
speaking
very
loud
she
should
the
more
readily
be
heard
consequently
she
sought
a
fitting
spot
for
this
her
rural
sanctuary
the
place
she
selected
in
which
to
offer
up
her
daily
orisons
was
a
small
island
in
a
small
stream
covered
with
large
willow
shrubbery
beneath
which
the
sheep
had
made
their
pleasant
winding
paths
and
sheltering
themselves
from
the
scorching
rays
of
a
sun
luxuriated
in
the
cool
shadows
of
the
graceful
willows
as
they
listened
to
the
tiny
falls
of
the
silver
waters
it
was
a
lonely
spot
and
chosen
by
her
for
its
beauty
its
retirement
and
because
she
thought
that
there
in
the
noise
of
those
waters
she
could
speak
louder
to
god
without
being
overheard
by
any
who
might
pass
that
way
when
she
had
made
choice
of
her
sanctum
at
a
point
of
the
island
where
the
stream
met
after
having
been
separated
she
improved
it
by
pulling
away
the
branches
of
the
shrubs
from
the
centre
and
weaving
them
together
for
a
wall
on
the
outside
forming
a
circular
arched
alcove
made
entirely
of
the
graceful
willow
to
this
place
she
resorted
daily
and
in
pressing
times
much
more
frequently
at
this
time
her
prayers
or
more
appropriately
with
god
were
perfectly
original
and
unique
and
would
be
well
worth
preserving
were
it
possible
to
give
the
tones
and
manner
with
the
words
but
no
adequate
idea
of
them
can
be
written
while
the
tones
and
manner
remain
inexpressible
she
would
sometimes
repeat
father
in
heaven
in
her
low
dutch
as
taught
her
by
her
mother
after
that
all
was
from
the
suggestions
of
her
own
rude
mind
she
related
to
god
in
minute
detail
all
her
troubles
and
sufferings
inquiring
as
she
proceeded
you
think
that
right
god
and
closed
by
begging
to
be
delivered
from
the
evil
whatever
it
might
be
she
talked
to
god
as
familiarly
as
if
he
had
been
a
creature
like
herself
and
a
thousand
times
more
so
than
if
she
had
been
in
the
presence
of
some
earthly
potentate
she
demanded
with
little
expenditure
of
reverence
or
fear
a
supply
of
all
her
more
pressing
wants
and
at
times
her
demands
approached
very
near
to
commands
she
felt
as
if
god
was
under
obligation
to
her
much
more
than
she
was
to
him
he
seemed
to
her
benighted
vision
in
some
manner
bound
to
do
her
bidding
her
heart
recoils
now
with
very
dread
when
she
recalls
those
shocking
almost
blasphemous
conversations
with
great
jehovah
and
well
for
herself
did
she
deem
it
that
unlike
earthly
potentates
his
infinite
character
combined
the
tender
father
with
the
omniscient
and
omnipotent
creator
of
the
universe
she
at
first
commenced
promising
god
that
if
he
would
help
her
out
of
all
her
difficulties
she
would
pay
him
by
being
very
good
and
this
goodness
she
intended
as
a
remuneration
to
god
she
could
think
of
no
benefit
that
was
to
accrue
to
herself
or
her
from
her
leading
a
life
of
purity
and
generous
for
the
good
of
others
as
far
as
any
but
god
was
concerned
she
saw
nothing
in
it
but
penance
sustained
by
the
sternest
exertion
and
this
she
soon
found
much
more
easily
promised
than
performed
days
wore
trials
aid
was
invoked
and
the
same
promises
repeated
and
every
successive
night
found
her
part
of
the
contract
unfulfilled
she
now
began
to
excuse
herself
by
telling
god
she
could
not
be
good
in
her
present
circumstances
but
if
he
would
give
her
a
new
place
and
a
good
master
and
mistress
she
could
and
would
be
good
and
she
expressly
stipulated
that
she
would
be
good
one
day
to
show
god
how
good
she
would
be
all
of
the
time
when
he
should
surround
her
with
the
right
influences
and
she
should
be
delivered
from
the
temptations
that
then
so
sorely
beset
her
but
alas
when
night
came
and
she
became
conscious
that
she
had
yielded
to
all
her
temptations
and
entirely
failed
of
keeping
her
word
with
god
having
prayed
and
promised
one
hour
and
fallen
into
the
sins
of
anger
and
profanity
the
next
the
mortifying
reflection
weighed
on
her
mind
and
blunted
her
enjoyment
still
she
did
not
lay
it
deeply
to
heart
but
continued
to
repeat
her
demands
for
aid
and
her
promises
of
pay
with
full
purpose
of
heart
at
each
particular
time
that
that
day
she
would
not
fail
to
keep
her
plighted
word
thus
perished
the
inward
spark
like
a
flame
just
igniting
when
one
waits
to
see
whether
it
will
burn
on
or
die
out
till
the
long
desired
change
came
and
she
found
herself
in
a
new
place
with
a
good
mistress
and
one
who
never
instigated
an
otherwise
kind
master
to
be
unkind
to
her
in
short
a
place
where
she
had
literally
nothing
to
complain
of
and
where
for
a
time
she
was
more
happy
than
she
could
well
express
every
thing
there
was
so
pleasant
and
kind
and
good
and
all
so
comfortable
enough
of
every
thing
indeed
it
was
beautiful
she
exclaimed
here
at
van
wagener
the
reader
will
readily
perceive
she
must
have
been
was
so
happy
and
satisfied
that
god
was
entirely
forgotten
why
should
her
thoughts
turn
to
him
who
was
only
known
to
her
as
a
help
in
trouble
she
had
no
trouble
now
her
every
prayer
had
been
answered
in
every
minute
particular
she
had
been
delivered
from
her
persecutors
and
temptations
her
youngest
child
had
been
given
her
and
the
others
she
knew
she
had
no
means
of
sustaining
if
she
had
them
with
her
and
was
content
to
leave
them
behind
their
father
who
was
much
older
than
isabel
and
who
preferred
serving
his
time
out
in
slavery
to
the
trouble
and
dangers
of
the
course
she
pursued
remained
with
and
could
keep
an
eye
on
it
is
comparatively
little
that
they
can
do
for
each
other
while
they
remain
in
slavery
and
this
little
the
slave
like
persons
in
every
other
situation
of
life
is
not
always
disposed
to
perform
there
are
slaves
who
copying
the
selfishness
of
their
superiors
in
power
in
their
conduct
towards
their
fellows
who
may
be
thrown
upon
their
mercy
by
infirmity
or
illness
allow
them
to
suffer
for
want
of
that
kindness
and
care
which
it
is
fully
in
their
power
to
render
them
the
slaves
in
this
country
have
ever
been
allowed
to
celebrate
the
principal
if
not
some
of
the
lesser
festivals
observed
by
the
catholics
and
church
of
england
of
them
not
being
required
to
do
the
least
service
for
several
days
and
at
christmas
they
have
almost
universally
an
entire
week
to
themselves
except
perhaps
the
attending
to
a
few
duties
which
are
absolutely
required
for
the
comfort
of
the
families
they
belong
to
if
much
service
is
desired
they
are
hired
to
do
it
and
paid
for
it
as
if
they
were
free
the
more
sober
portion
of
them
spend
these
holidays
in
earning
a
little
money
most
of
them
visit
and
attend
parties
and
balls
and
not
a
few
of
them
spend
it
in
the
lowest
dissipation
this
respite
from
toil
is
granted
them
by
all
religionists
of
whatever
persuasion
and
probably
originated
from
the
fact
that
many
of
the
first
slaveholders
were
members
of
the
church
of
england
frederick
douglass
who
has
devoted
his
great
heart
and
noble
talents
entirely
to
the
furtherance
of
the
cause
of
his
race
has
what
i
know
of
the
effect
of
their
holidays
upon
the
slave
i
believe
them
to
be
among
the
most
effective
means
in
the
hands
of
the
slaveholder
in
keeping
down
the
spirit
of
insurrection
were
the
slaveholders
at
once
to
abandon
this
practice
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
it
would
lead
to
an
immediate
insurrection
among
the
slaves
these
holidays
serve
as
conductors
or
to
carry
off
the
rebellious
spirit
of
enslaved
humanity
but
for
these
the
slave
would
be
forced
up
to
the
wildest
desperation
and
woe
betide
the
slaveholder
the
day
he
ventures
to
remove
or
hinder
the
operation
of
those
conductors
i
warn
him
that
in
such
an
event
a
spirit
will
go
forth
in
their
midst
more
to
be
dreaded
than
the
most
appalling
earthquake
when
isabella
had
been
at
van
wagener
a
few
months
she
saw
in
prospect
one
of
the
festivals
approaching
she
knows
it
by
none
but
the
dutch
name
pingster
as
she
calls
i
think
it
must
have
been
whitsuntide
in
english
she
says
she
back
into
egypt
and
every
thing
looked
pleasant
there
as
she
saw
retrospectively
all
her
former
companions
enjoying
their
freedom
for
at
least
a
little
space
as
well
as
their
wonted
convivialities
and
in
her
heart
she
longed
to
be
with
them
with
this
picture
before
her
mind
eye
she
contrasted
the
quiet
peaceful
life
she
was
living
with
the
excellent
people
of
wahkendall
and
it
seemed
so
dull
and
void
of
incident
that
the
very
contrast
served
but
to
heighten
her
desire
to
return
that
at
least
she
might
enjoy
with
them
once
more
the
coming
festivities
these
feelings
had
occupied
a
secret
corner
of
her
breast
for
some
time
when
one
morning
she
told
van
wagener
that
her
old
master
dumont
would
come
that
day
and
that
she
should
go
home
with
him
on
his
return
they
expressed
some
surprise
and
asked
her
where
she
obtained
her
information
she
replied
that
no
one
had
told
her
but
she
felt
that
he
would
come
it
seemed
to
have
been
one
of
those
that
cast
their
shadows
before
for
before
night
dumont
made
his
appearance
she
informed
him
of
her
intention
to
accompany
him
home
he
answered
with
a
smile
shall
not
take
you
back
again
you
ran
away
from
me
thinking
his
manner
contradicted
his
words
she
did
not
feel
repulsed
but
made
herself
and
child
ready
and
when
her
former
master
had
seated
himself
in
the
open
dearborn
she
walked
towards
it
intending
to
place
herself
and
child
in
the
rear
and
go
with
him
but
ere
she
reached
the
vehicle
she
says
that
god
revealed
himself
to
her
with
all
the
suddenness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
showing
her
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
that
he
was
all
he
pervaded
the
that
there
was
no
place
where
god
was
not
she
became
instantly
conscious
of
her
great
sin
in
forgetting
her
almighty
friend
and
help
in
time
of
trouble
all
her
unfulfilled
promises
arose
before
her
like
a
vexed
sea
whose
waves
run
mountains
high
and
her
soul
which
seemed
but
one
mass
of
lies
shrunk
back
aghast
from
the
look
of
him
whom
she
had
formerly
talked
to
as
if
he
had
been
a
being
like
herself
and
she
would
now
fain
have
hid
herself
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
to
have
escaped
his
dread
presence
but
she
plainly
saw
there
was
no
place
not
even
in
hell
where
he
was
not
and
where
could
she
flee
another
such
look
as
she
expressed
it
and
she
felt
that
she
must
be
extinguished
forever
even
as
one
with
the
breath
of
his
mouth
out
a
lamp
so
that
no
spark
remains
a
dire
dread
of
annihilation
now
seized
her
and
she
waited
to
see
if
by
look
she
was
to
be
stricken
from
existence
up
even
as
the
fire
licketh
up
the
oil
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
when
at
last
the
second
look
came
not
and
her
attention
was
once
more
called
to
outward
things
she
observed
her
master
had
left
and
exclaiming
aloud
god
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
big
walked
into
the
house
and
made
an
effort
to
resume
her
work
but
the
workings
of
the
inward
man
were
too
absorbing
to
admit
of
much
attention
to
her
avocations
she
desired
to
talk
to
god
but
her
vileness
utterly
forbade
it
and
she
was
not
able
to
prefer
a
petition
said
she
i
lie
again
to
god
i
have
told
him
nothing
but
lies
and
shall
i
speak
again
and
tell
another
lie
to
god
she
could
not
and
now
she
began
to
wish
for
some
one
to
speak
to
god
for
her
then
a
space
seemed
opening
between
her
and
god
and
she
felt
that
if
some
one
who
was
worthy
in
the
sight
of
heaven
would
but
plead
for
her
in
their
own
name
and
not
let
god
know
it
came
from
her
who
was
so
unworthy
god
might
grant
it
at
length
a
friend
appeared
to
stand
between
herself
and
an
insulted
deity
and
she
felt
as
sensibly
refreshed
as
when
on
a
hot
day
an
umbrella
had
been
interposed
between
her
scorching
head
and
a
burning
sun
but
who
was
this
friend
became
the
next
inquiry
was
it
deencia
who
had
so
often
befriended
her
she
looked
at
her
with
her
new
power
of
lo
she
too
seemed
all
and
putrifying
sores
like
herself
no
it
was
some
one
very
different
from
deencia
are
you
she
exclaimed
as
the
vision
brightened
into
a
form
distinct
beaming
with
the
beauty
of
holiness
and
radiant
with
love
she
then
said
audibly
addressing
the
mysterious
know
you
and
i
do
know
you
meaning
seem
perfectly
familiar
i
feel
that
you
not
only
love
me
but
that
you
always
have
loved
i
know
you
can
not
call
you
by
name
when
she
said
know
you
the
subject
of
the
vision
remained
distinct
and
quiet
when
she
said
know
you
it
moved
restlessly
about
like
agitated
waters
so
while
she
repeated
without
intermission
know
you
i
know
you
that
the
vision
might
are
you
was
the
cry
of
her
heart
and
her
whole
soul
was
in
one
deep
prayer
that
this
heavenly
personage
might
be
revealed
to
her
and
remain
with
her
at
length
after
bending
both
soul
and
body
with
the
intensity
of
this
desire
till
breath
and
strength
seemed
failing
and
she
could
maintain
her
position
no
longer
an
answer
came
to
her
saying
distinctly
is
jesus
she
responded
is
jesus
previous
to
these
exercises
of
mind
she
heard
jesus
mentioned
in
reading
or
speaking
but
had
received
from
what
she
heard
no
impression
that
he
was
any
other
than
an
eminent
man
like
a
washington
or
a
lafayette
now
he
appeared
to
her
delighted
mental
vision
as
so
mild
so
good
and
so
every
way
lovely
and
he
loved
her
so
much
and
how
strange
that
he
had
always
loved
her
and
she
had
never
known
it
and
how
great
a
blessing
he
conferred
in
that
he
should
stand
between
her
and
god
and
god
was
no
longer
a
terror
and
a
dread
to
her
she
stopped
not
to
argue
the
point
even
in
her
own
mind
whether
he
had
reconciled
her
to
god
or
god
to
herself
though
she
thinks
the
former
now
being
but
too
happy
that
god
was
no
longer
to
her
as
a
consuming
fire
and
jesus
was
lovely
her
heart
was
now
full
of
joy
and
gladness
as
it
had
been
of
terror
and
at
one
time
of
despair
in
the
light
of
her
great
happiness
the
world
was
clad
in
new
beauty
the
very
air
sparkled
as
with
diamonds
and
was
redolent
of
heaven
she
contemplated
the
unapproachable
barriers
that
existed
between
herself
and
the
great
of
this
world
as
the
world
calls
greatness
and
made
surprising
comparisons
between
them
and
the
union
existing
between
herself
and
the
transcendently
lovely
as
well
as
great
and
powerful
for
so
he
appeared
to
her
though
he
seemed
but
human
and
she
watched
for
his
bodily
appearance
feeling
that
she
should
know
him
if
she
saw
him
and
when
he
came
she
would
go
and
dwell
with
him
as
with
a
dear
friend
it
was
not
given
to
her
to
see
that
he
loved
any
other
and
she
thought
if
others
came
to
know
and
love
him
as
she
did
she
should
be
thrust
aside
and
forgotten
being
herself
but
a
poor
ignorant
slave
with
little
to
recommend
her
to
his
notice
and
when
she
heard
him
spoken
off
she
said
others
know
jesus
i
thought
no
one
knew
jesus
but
me
and
she
felt
a
sort
of
jealousy
lest
she
should
be
robbed
of
her
newly
found
treasure
she
conceived
one
day
as
she
listened
to
reading
that
she
heard
an
intimation
that
jesus
was
married
and
hastily
inquired
if
jesus
had
a
wife
said
the
reader
have
a
wife
jesus
god
inquired
isabella
to
be
sure
he
is
was
the
answer
returned
from
this
time
her
conceptions
of
jesus
became
more
elevated
and
spiritual
and
she
sometimes
spoke
of
him
as
god
in
accordance
with
the
teaching
she
had
received
but
when
she
was
simply
told
that
the
christian
world
was
much
divided
on
the
subject
of
christ
believing
him
to
be
coequal
with
the
be
god
in
and
of
himself
god
of
very
god
that
he
is
the
begotten
son
of
god
others
that
he
is
or
was
rather
but
a
mere
said
that
i
only
know
as
i
saw
i
did
not
see
him
to
be
god
else
how
could
he
stand
between
me
and
god
i
saw
him
as
a
friend
standing
between
me
and
god
through
whom
love
flowed
as
from
a
fountain
now
so
far
from
expressing
her
views
of
christ
character
and
office
in
accordance
with
any
system
of
theology
extant
she
says
she
believes
jesus
is
the
same
spirit
that
was
in
our
first
parents
adam
and
eve
in
the
beginning
when
they
came
from
the
hand
of
their
creator
when
they
sinned
through
disobedience
this
pure
spirit
forsook
them
and
fled
to
heaven
that
there
it
remained
until
it
returned
again
in
the
person
of
jesus
and
that
previous
to
a
personal
union
with
him
man
is
but
a
brute
possessing
only
the
spirit
of
an
animal
she
avers
that
in
her
darkest
hours
she
had
no
fear
of
any
worse
hell
than
the
one
she
then
carried
in
her
bosom
though
it
had
ever
been
pictured
to
her
in
its
deepest
colors
and
threatened
her
as
a
reward
for
all
her
misdemeanors
her
vileness
and
god
holiness
and
presence
which
filled
immensity
and
threatened
her
with
constant
annihilation
composed
the
burden
of
her
vision
of
terror
her
faith
in
prayer
is
equal
to
her
faith
in
the
love
of
jesus
her
language
is
others
say
what
they
will
of
the
efficacy
of
prayer
i
believe
in
it
and
i
shall
pray
thank
god
yes
i
shall
always
pray
she
exclaims
putting
her
hands
together
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
for
some
time
subsequent
to
the
happy
change
we
have
spoken
off
isabella
prayers
partook
largely
of
their
former
character
and
while
in
deep
affliction
she
labored
for
the
recovery
of
her
son
she
prayed
with
constancy
and
fervor
and
the
following
may
be
taken
as
a
specimen
god
you
know
how
much
i
am
distressed
for
i
have
told
you
again
and
again
now
god
help
me
get
my
son
if
you
were
in
trouble
as
i
am
and
i
could
help
you
as
you
can
me
think
i
would
do
it
yes
god
you
know
i
would
do
it
god
you
know
i
have
no
money
but
you
can
make
the
people
do
for
me
and
you
must
make
the
people
do
for
me
i
will
never
give
you
peace
till
you
do
god
god
make
the
people
hear
let
them
turn
me
off
without
hearing
and
helping
me
and
she
has
not
a
particle
of
doubt
that
god
heard
her
and
especially
disposed
the
hearts
of
thoughtless
clerks
eminent
lawyers
and
grave
judges
and
whom
and
herself
there
seemed
to
her
almost
an
infinite
listen
to
her
suit
with
patient
and
respectful
attention
backing
it
up
with
all
needed
aid
the
sense
of
her
nothingness
in
the
eyes
of
those
with
whom
she
contended
for
her
rights
sometimes
fell
on
her
like
a
heavy
weight
which
nothing
but
her
unwavering
confidence
in
an
arm
which
she
believed
to
be
stronger
than
all
others
combined
could
have
raised
from
her
sinking
spirit
how
little
did
i
feel
she
repeated
with
a
powerful
emphasis
would
you
wonder
if
you
could
have
seen
me
in
my
ignorance
and
destitution
trotting
about
the
streets
meanly
clad
and
oh
god
only
could
have
made
such
people
hear
me
and
he
did
it
in
answer
to
my
prayers
and
this
perfect
trust
based
on
the
rock
of
deity
was
a
fortress
which
raising
her
above
the
battlements
of
fear
and
shielding
her
from
the
machinations
of
the
enemy
impelled
her
onward
in
the
struggle
till
the
foe
was
vanquished
and
the
victory
gained
we
have
now
seen
isabella
her
youngest
daughter
and
her
only
son
in
possession
of
at
least
their
nominal
freedom
it
has
been
said
that
the
freedom
of
the
most
free
of
the
colored
people
of
this
country
is
but
nominal
but
stinted
and
limited
as
it
is
at
best
it
is
an
immense
remove
from
chattel
slavery
this
fact
is
disputed
i
know
but
i
have
no
confidence
in
the
honesty
of
such
questionings
if
they
are
made
in
sincerity
i
honor
not
the
judgment
that
thus
decides
her
husband
quite
advanced
in
age
and
infirm
of
health
was
emancipated
with
the
balance
of
the
adult
slaves
of
the
state
according
to
law
the
following
summer
july
for
a
few
years
after
this
event
he
was
able
to
earn
a
scanty
living
and
when
he
failed
to
do
that
he
was
dependent
on
the
cold
charity
and
died
in
a
poorhouse
isabella
had
herself
and
two
children
to
provide
for
her
wages
were
trifling
for
at
that
time
the
wages
of
females
were
at
a
small
advance
from
nothing
and
she
doubtless
had
to
learn
the
first
elements
of
what
slaves
that
were
never
allowed
to
make
any
stipulations
or
calculations
for
themselves
ever
possessed
an
adequate
idea
of
the
true
value
of
time
or
in
fact
of
any
material
thing
in
the
universe
to
such
using
is
is
a
word
to
be
sneered
at
of
course
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
make
to
herself
a
home
around
whose
sacred
she
could
collect
her
family
as
they
gradually
emerged
from
their
of
bondage
a
home
where
she
could
cultivate
their
affection
administer
to
their
wants
and
instil
into
the
opening
minds
of
her
children
those
principles
of
virtue
and
that
love
of
purity
truth
and
benevolence
which
must
for
ever
form
the
foundation
of
a
life
of
usefulness
and
happiness
this
was
far
beyond
her
power
or
means
in
more
senses
than
one
and
it
should
be
taken
into
the
account
whenever
a
comparison
is
instituted
between
the
progress
made
by
her
children
in
virtue
and
goodness
and
the
progress
of
those
who
have
been
nurtured
in
the
genial
warmth
of
a
sunny
home
where
good
influences
cluster
and
bad
ones
are
carefully
upon
line
and
precept
upon
precept
are
daily
brought
to
their
quotidian
where
in
short
every
appliance
is
brought
in
requisition
that
parents
can
bring
to
bear
on
one
of
the
dearest
objects
of
a
life
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
their
children
but
god
forbid
that
this
suggestion
should
be
wrested
from
its
original
intent
and
made
to
shield
any
one
from
merited
rebuke
isabella
children
are
now
of
an
age
to
know
good
from
evil
and
may
easily
inform
themselves
on
any
point
where
they
may
yet
be
in
doubt
and
if
they
now
suffer
themselves
to
be
drawn
by
temptation
into
the
paths
of
the
destroyer
or
forget
what
is
due
to
the
mother
who
has
done
and
suffered
so
much
for
them
and
who
now
that
she
is
descending
into
the
vale
of
years
and
feels
her
health
and
strength
declining
will
turn
her
expecting
eyes
to
them
for
aid
and
comfort
just
as
instinctively
as
the
child
turns
its
confiding
eye
to
its
fond
parent
when
it
seeks
for
succor
or
for
it
is
now
their
turn
to
do
the
work
and
bear
the
burdens
of
life
so
all
must
bear
them
in
turn
as
the
wheel
of
life
rolls
on
if
i
say
they
forget
this
their
duty
and
their
happiness
and
pursue
an
opposite
course
of
sin
and
folly
they
must
lose
the
respect
of
the
wise
and
good
and
find
when
too
late
that
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
new
trials
the
reader
will
pardon
this
passing
homily
while
we
return
to
our
narrative
we
were
saying
that
the
of
isabella
and
her
plan
they
drew
of
what
they
would
do
and
the
comforts
they
thought
to
have
when
they
should
obtain
their
freedom
and
a
little
home
of
their
had
all
turned
to
air
by
the
postponement
of
their
freedom
to
so
late
a
day
these
delusive
hopes
were
never
to
be
realized
and
a
new
set
of
trials
was
gradually
to
open
before
her
these
were
the
trials
of
watching
over
her
children
scattered
and
imminently
exposed
to
the
temptations
of
the
adversary
with
few
if
any
fixed
principles
to
sustain
them
she
says
little
did
i
know
myself
of
the
best
way
to
instruct
and
counsel
them
yet
i
did
the
best
i
then
knew
when
with
them
i
took
them
to
the
religious
meetings
i
talked
to
and
prayed
for
and
with
them
when
they
did
wrong
i
scolded
at
and
whipped
them
isabella
and
her
son
had
been
free
about
a
year
when
they
went
to
reside
in
the
city
of
new
york
a
place
which
she
would
doubtless
have
avoided
could
she
have
foreseen
what
was
there
in
store
for
her
for
this
view
into
the
future
would
have
taught
her
what
she
only
learned
by
bitter
experience
that
the
baneful
influences
going
up
from
such
a
city
were
not
the
best
helps
to
education
commenced
as
the
education
of
her
children
had
been
her
son
peter
was
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
just
at
that
age
when
no
lad
should
be
subjected
to
the
temptations
of
such
a
place
unprotected
as
he
was
save
by
the
feeble
arm
of
a
mother
herself
a
servant
there
he
was
growing
up
to
be
a
tall
active
lad
of
quick
perceptions
mild
and
cheerful
in
his
disposition
with
much
that
was
open
generous
and
winning
about
him
but
with
little
power
to
withstand
temptation
and
a
ready
ingenuity
to
provide
himself
with
ways
and
means
to
carry
out
his
plans
and
conceal
from
his
mother
and
her
friends
all
such
as
he
knew
would
not
meet
their
approbation
as
will
be
readily
believed
he
was
soon
drawn
into
a
circle
of
associates
who
did
not
improve
either
his
habits
or
his
morals
two
years
passed
before
isabella
knew
what
character
peter
was
establishing
for
himself
among
his
low
and
worthless
under
the
assumed
name
of
peter
williams
and
she
began
to
feel
a
parent
pride
in
the
promising
appearance
of
her
only
son
but
alas
this
pride
and
pleasure
were
shortly
dissipated
as
distressing
facts
relative
to
him
came
one
by
one
to
her
astonished
ear
a
friend
of
isabella
a
lady
who
was
much
pleased
with
the
good
humor
ingenuity
and
open
confessions
of
peter
when
driven
into
a
corner
and
who
she
said
so
smart
he
ought
to
have
an
education
if
any
one
ought
ten
dollars
as
tuition
fee
for
him
to
attend
a
navigation
school
but
peter
little
inclined
to
spend
his
leisure
hours
in
study
when
he
might
be
enjoying
himself
in
the
dance
or
otherwise
with
his
boon
companions
went
regularly
and
made
some
plausible
excuses
to
the
teacher
who
received
them
as
genuine
along
with
the
ten
dollars
of
mrs
and
while
his
mother
and
her
friend
believed
him
improving
at
school
he
was
to
their
latent
sorrow
improving
in
a
very
different
place
or
places
and
on
entirely
opposite
principles
they
also
procured
him
an
excellent
place
as
a
coachman
but
wanting
money
he
sold
his
livery
and
other
things
belonging
to
his
master
who
having
conceived
a
kind
regard
for
him
considered
his
youth
and
prevented
the
law
from
falling
with
all
its
rigor
upon
his
head
still
he
continued
to
abuse
his
privileges
and
to
involve
himself
in
repeated
difficulties
from
which
his
mother
as
often
extricated
him
at
each
time
she
talked
much
and
reasoned
and
remonstrated
with
him
and
he
would
with
such
perfect
frankness
lay
open
his
whole
soul
to
her
telling
her
he
had
never
intended
doing
harm
he
had
been
led
along
little
by
little
till
before
he
was
aware
he
found
himself
in
he
had
tried
to
be
how
when
he
would
have
been
so
was
present
with
him
he
knew
not
how
it
was
his
mother
beginning
to
feel
that
the
city
was
no
place
for
him
urged
his
going
to
sea
and
would
have
shipped
him
on
board
a
but
peter
was
not
disposed
to
consent
to
that
proposition
while
the
city
and
its
pleasures
were
accessible
to
him
isabella
now
became
a
prey
to
distressing
fears
dreading
lest
the
next
day
or
hour
come
fraught
with
the
report
of
some
dreadful
crime
committed
or
abetted
by
her
son
she
thanks
the
lord
for
sparing
her
that
giant
sorrow
as
all
his
wrong
doings
never
ranked
higher
in
the
eye
of
the
law
than
misdemeanors
but
as
she
could
see
no
improvement
in
peter
as
a
last
resort
she
resolved
to
leave
him
for
a
time
unassisted
to
bear
the
penalty
of
his
conduct
and
see
what
effect
that
would
have
on
him
in
the
trial
hour
she
remained
firm
in
her
resolution
peter
again
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
sent
for
his
mother
as
usual
but
she
went
not
to
his
relief
in
his
extremity
he
sent
for
peter
williams
a
respectable
colored
barber
whose
name
he
had
been
wearing
and
who
sometimes
helped
young
culprits
out
of
their
troubles
and
sent
them
from
city
dangers
by
shipping
them
on
board
of
whaling
vessels
the
curiosity
of
this
man
was
awakened
by
the
culprit
bearing
his
own
name
he
went
to
the
tombs
and
inquired
into
his
case
but
could
not
believe
what
peter
told
him
respecting
his
mother
and
family
yet
he
redeemed
him
and
peter
promised
to
leave
new
york
in
a
vessel
that
was
to
sail
in
the
course
of
a
week
he
went
to
see
his
mother
and
informed
her
of
what
had
happened
to
him
she
listened
incredulously
as
to
an
idle
tale
he
asked
her
to
go
with
him
and
see
for
herself
she
went
giving
no
credence
to
his
story
till
she
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
williams
and
heard
him
saying
to
her
am
very
glad
i
have
assisted
your
son
he
stood
in
great
need
of
sympathy
and
assistance
but
i
could
not
think
he
had
such
a
mother
here
although
he
assured
me
he
had
isabella
great
trouble
now
was
a
fear
lest
her
son
should
deceive
his
benefactor
and
be
missing
when
the
vessel
sailed
but
he
begged
her
earnestly
to
trust
him
for
he
said
he
had
resolved
to
do
better
and
meant
to
abide
by
the
resolve
isabella
heart
gave
her
no
peace
till
the
time
of
sailing
when
peter
sent
williams
and
another
messenger
whom
she
knew
to
tell
her
he
had
sailed
but
for
a
month
afterwards
she
looked
to
see
him
emerging
from
some
in
the
city
and
appearing
before
her
so
afraid
was
she
that
he
was
still
unfaithful
and
doing
wrong
but
he
did
not
appear
and
at
length
she
believed
him
really
gone
he
left
in
the
summer
of
and
his
friends
heard
nothing
further
from
him
till
his
mother

son
van
wagener
since
the
date
of
the
last
letter
isabella
has
heard
no
tidings
from
her
son
though
ardently
does
her
mother
heart
long
for
such
tidings
as
her
thoughts
follow
him
around
the
world
in
his
perilous
vocation
saying
within
is
good
now
i
have
no
doubt
i
feel
sure
that
he
has
persevered
and
kept
the
resolve
he
made
before
he
left
home
seemed
so
different
before
he
went
so
determined
to
do
better
his
letters
are
inserted
here
for
preservation
in
case
they
prove
the
last
she
ever
hears
from
him
in
this
world
finding
a
brother
and
sister
when
isabella
had
obtained
the
freedom
of
her
son
she
remained
in
kingston
where
she
had
been
drawn
by
the
judicial
process
about
a
year
during
which
time
she
became
a
member
of
the
methodist
church
there
and
when
she
went
to
new
york
she
took
a
letter
missive
from
that
church
to
the
methodist
church
in
john
street
afterwards
she
withdrew
her
connection
with
that
church
and
joined
zion
church
in
church
street
composed
entirely
of
colored
people
with
the
latter
church
she
remained
until
she
went
to
reside
with
pierson
after
which
she
was
gradually
drawn
into
the
set
up
by
the
prophet
matthias
in
the
name
of
god
the
father
for
he
said
the
spirit
of
god
the
father
dwelt
in
him
while
isabella
was
in
new
york
her
sister
sophia
came
from
newburg
to
reside
in
the
former
place
isabel
had
been
favored
with
occasional
interviews
with
this
sister
although
at
one
time
she
lost
sight
of
her
for
the
space
of
seventeen
the
entire
period
of
her
being
at
when
she
appeared
before
her
again
handsomely
dressed
she
did
not
recognize
her
till
informed
who
she
was
sophia
informed
her
that
her
brother
brother
she
had
never
in
the
city
and
when
she
introduced
him
to
isabella
he
informed
her
that
their
sister
nancy
had
been
living
in
the
city
and
had
deceased
a
few
months
before
he
described
her
features
her
dress
her
manner
and
said
she
had
for
some
time
been
a
member
in
zion
church
naming
the
class
she
belonged
to
isabella
almost
instantly
recognized
her
as
a
sister
in
the
church
with
whom
she
had
knelt
at
the
altar
and
with
whom
she
had
exchanged
the
speaking
pressure
of
the
hand
in
recognition
of
their
spiritual
sisterhood
little
thinking
at
the
time
that
they
were
also
children
of
the
same
earthly
bomefree
and
bett
as
inquiries
and
answers
rapidly
passed
and
the
conviction
deepened
that
this
was
their
sister
the
very
sister
they
had
heard
so
much
of
but
had
never
seen
for
she
was
the
sister
that
had
been
locked
in
the
great
old
fashioned
when
she
was
taken
away
never
to
behold
her
mother
face
again
this
side
the
and
michael
the
narrator
was
the
brother
who
had
shared
her
fate
isabella
thought
here
she
was
we
met
and
was
i
not
at
the
time
struck
with
the
peculiar
feeling
of
her
bony
hardness
so
just
like
mine
and
yet
i
could
not
know
she
was
my
sister
and
now
i
see
she
looked
so
like
my
mother
and
isabella
wept
and
not
alone
sophia
wept
and
the
strong
man
michael
mingled
his
tears
with
theirs
lord
inquired
isabella
is
this
slavery
that
it
can
do
such
dreadful
things
what
evil
can
it
not
do
well
may
she
ask
for
surely
the
evils
it
can
and
does
do
daily
and
hourly
can
never
be
summed
up
till
we
can
see
them
as
they
are
recorded
by
him
who
writes
no
errors
and
reckons
without
mistake
this
account
which
now
varies
so
widely
in
the
estimate
of
different
minds
will
be
viewed
alike
by
all
think
you
dear
reader
when
that
day
comes
the
most
abolitionist
will
i
saw
all
this
while
on
the
earth
will
he
not
rather
say
who
has
conceived
the
breadth
and
depth
of
this
moral
malaria
this
putrescent
perhaps
the
pioneers
in
the
slave
cause
will
be
as
much
surprised
as
any
to
find
that
with
all
their
looking
there
remained
so
much
unseen
gleanings
there
are
some
hard
things
that
crossed
isabella
life
while
in
slavery
that
she
has
no
desire
to
publish
for
various
reasons
first
because
the
parties
from
whose
hands
she
suffered
them
have
rendered
up
their
account
to
a
higher
tribunal
and
their
innocent
friends
alone
are
living
to
have
their
feelings
injured
by
the
recital
secondly
because
they
are
not
all
for
the
public
ear
from
their
very
nature
thirdly
and
not
least
because
she
says
were
she
to
tell
all
that
happened
to
her
as
a
that
she
knows
is
would
seem
to
others
especially
the
uninitiated
so
unaccountable
so
unreasonable
and
what
is
usually
called
so
unnatural
though
it
may
be
questioned
whether
people
do
not
always
act
naturally
they
would
not
easily
believe
it
no
she
says
call
me
a
liar
they
would
indeed
and
i
do
not
wish
to
say
anything
to
destroy
my
own
character
for
veracity
though
what
i
say
is
strictly
true
some
things
have
been
omitted
through
forgetfulness
which
not
having
been
mentioned
in
their
places
can
only
be
briefly
spoken
of
here
as
that
her
father
bomefree
had
had
two
wives
before
he
took
mau
mau
bett
one
of
whom
if
not
both
were
torn
from
him
by
the
iron
hand
of
the
ruthless
trafficker
in
human
flesh
her
husband
thomas
after
one
of
his
wives
had
been
sold
away
from
him
ran
away
to
new
york
city
where
he
remained
a
year
or
two
before
he
was
discovered
and
taken
back
to
the
of
slavery
her
master
dumont
when
he
promised
isabella
one
year
of
her
time
before
the
state
should
make
her
free
made
the
same
promise
to
her
husband
and
in
addition
to
freedom
they
were
promised
a
log
cabin
for
a
home
of
their
own
all
of
which
with
the
resulting
therefrom
went
into
the
repository
of
unfulfilled
promises
and
unrealized
hopes
she
had
often
heard
her
father
repeat
a
thrilling
story
of
a
little
which
because
it
annoyed
the
family
with
its
cries
was
caught
up
by
a
white
man
who
dashed
its
brains
out
against
the
wall
an
indian
for
indians
were
plenty
in
that
region
then
passed
along
as
the
bereaved
mother
washed
the
bloody
corpse
of
her
murdered
child
and
learning
the
cause
of
its
death
said
with
characteristic
vehemence
i
had
been
here
i
would
have
put
my
tomahawk
in
his
head
meaning
the
murderer
of
the
cruelty
of
one
had
a
sick
who
was
lingering
with
a
slow
consumption
whom
he
made
to
spin
regardless
of
her
weakness
and
suffering
and
this
woman
had
a
child
that
was
unable
to
walk
or
talk
at
the
age
of
five
years
neither
could
it
cry
like
other
children
but
made
a
constant
piteous
moaning
sound
this
exhibition
of
helplessness
and
imbecility
instead
of
exciting
the
master
pity
stung
his
cupidity
and
so
enraged
him
that
he
would
kick
the
poor
thing
about
like
a
isabella
informant
had
seen
this
brute
of
a
man
when
the
child
was
curled
up
under
a
chair
innocently
amusing
itself
with
a
few
sticks
drag
it
hence
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
tormenting
it
she
had
see
him
with
one
blow
of
his
foot
send
it
rolling
quite
across
the
room
and
down
the
steps
at
the
door
oh
how
she
wished
it
might
instantly
die
she
said
seemed
as
tough
as
a
moccasin
though
it
did
die
at
last
and
made
glad
the
heart
of
its
friends
and
its
persecutor
no
doubt
rejoiced
with
them
but
from
very
different
motives
but
the
day
of
his
retribution
was
not
far
he
sickened
and
his
reason
fled
it
was
fearful
to
hear
his
old
slave
soon
tell
how
in
the
day
of
his
calamity
she
treated
him
she
was
very
strong
and
was
therefore
selected
to
support
her
master
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
by
putting
her
arms
around
while
she
stood
behind
him
it
was
then
that
she
did
her
best
to
wreak
her
vengeance
on
him
she
would
clutch
his
feeble
frame
in
her
iron
grasp
as
in
a
vice
and
when
her
mistress
did
not
see
would
give
him
a
squeeze
a
shake
and
lifting
him
up
set
him
down
again
as
hard
as
possible
if
his
breathing
betrayed
too
tight
a
grasp
and
her
mistress
said
careful
do
hurt
him
soan
her
answer
was
no
missus
no
in
her
most
pleasant
then
as
soon
as
missus
eyes
and
ears
were
engaged
away
another
bounce
she
was
afraid
the
disease
alone
would
let
him
recover
event
she
dreaded
more
than
to
do
wrong
herself
isabella
asked
her
if
she
were
not
afraid
his
spirit
would
haunt
her
no
says
soan
was
so
wicked
the
devil
will
never
let
him
out
of
hell
long
enough
for
that
many
slaveholders
boast
of
the
love
of
their
slaves
how
would
it
freeze
the
blood
of
some
of
them
to
know
what
kind
of
love
rankles
in
the
bosoms
of
slaves
for
them
witness
the
attempt
to
poison
calhoun
and
hundreds
of
similar
cases
most
to
every
body
because
committed
by
slaves
supposed
to
be
so
grateful
for
their
chains
these
reflections
bring
to
mind
a
discussion
on
this
point
between
the
writer
and
a
slaveholding
friend
in
kentucky
on
christmas
morning
we
had
asserted
that
until
mankind
were
far
in
advance
of
what
they
are
now
irresponsible
power
over
our
would
be
as
it
is
abused
our
friend
declared
it
was
his
conviction
that
the
cruelties
of
slavery
existed
chiefly
in
imagination
and
that
no
person
in
county
where
we
then
were
but
would
be
above
a
helpless
slave
we
answered
that
if
his
belief
was
the
people
in
kentucky
were
greatly
in
advance
of
the
people
of
new
we
would
not
dare
say
as
much
as
that
of
any
there
letting
alone
counties
no
we
would
not
answer
for
our
own
conduct
even
on
so
delicate
a
point
the
next
evening
he
very
magnanimously
overthrew
his
own
position
and
established
ours
by
informing
us
that
on
the
morning
previous
and
as
near
as
we
could
learn
at
the
very
hour
in
which
we
were
earnestly
discussing
the
probabilities
of
the
case
a
young
woman
of
fine
appearance
and
high
standing
in
society
the
pride
of
her
husband
and
the
mother
of
an
infant
daughter
only
a
few
miles
from
us
ay
in
county
too
was
actually
beating
in
the
skull
of
a
called
tabby
and
not
content
with
that
had
her
tied
up
and
whipped
after
her
skull
was
broken
and
she
died
hanging
to
the
bedstead
to
which
she
had
been
fastened
when
informed
that
tabby
was
dead
she
answered
am
glad
of
it
for
she
has
worried
my
life
out
of
me
but
tabby
highest
good
was
probably
not
the
end
proposed
by
for
no
one
supposed
she
meant
to
kill
her
tabby
was
considered
quite
lacking
in
good
sense
and
no
doubt
belonged
to
that
class
at
the
south
that
are
silly
enough
to
of
moderate
correction
a
mob
collected
around
the
house
for
an
hour
or
two
in
that
manner
expressing
a
momentary
indignation
but
was
she
treated
as
a
murderess
not
at
all
she
was
allowed
to
take
boat
for
her
residence
was
near
the
beautiful
ohio
that
evening
to
spend
a
few
months
with
her
absent
friends
after
which
she
returned
and
remained
with
her
husband
no
one
to
or
make
her
afraid
had
she
been
left
to
the
punishment
of
an
outraged
conscience
from
right
motives
i
would
have
with
exceeding
joy
but
to
see
the
life
of
one
woman
and
she
a
murderess
put
in
the
balance
against
the
lives
of
three
millions
of
innocent
slaves
and
to
contrast
her
punishment
with
what
i
felt
would
be
the
punishment
of
one
who
was
merely
suspected
of
being
an
equal
friend
of
all
mankind
regardless
of
color
or
condition
caused
my
blood
to
stir
within
me
and
my
heart
to
sicken
at
the
thought
the
husband
of
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
alluded
to
and
when
he
arrived
some
weeks
afterwards
bringing
beautiful
presents
to
his
cherished
companion
he
beheld
his
once
happy
home
deserted
tabby
murdered
and
buried
in
the
garden
and
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
the
mother
of
his
child
the
doer
of
a
dreadful
deed
a
murderess
when
isabella
went
to
new
york
city
she
went
in
company
with
a
miss
grear
who
introduced
her
to
the
family
of
james
latourette
a
wealthy
merchant
and
a
methodist
in
religion
but
who
the
latter
part
of
his
life
felt
that
he
had
outgrown
ordinances
and
advocated
free
meetings
holding
them
at
his
own
for
several
years
previous
to
his
death
she
worked
for
them
and
they
generously
gave
her
a
home
while
she
labored
for
others
and
in
their
kindness
made
her
as
one
of
their
own
at
that
time
the
reform
movement
was
awakening
the
attention
of
the
benevolent
in
that
city
many
women
among
whom
were
latourette
and
miss
grear
became
deeply
interested
in
making
an
attempt
to
reform
their
fallen
sisters
even
the
most
degraded
of
them
and
in
this
enterprise
of
labor
and
danger
they
enlisted
isabella
and
others
who
for
a
time
put
forth
their
most
zealous
efforts
and
performed
the
work
of
missionaries
with
much
apparent
success
isabella
accompanied
those
ladies
to
the
most
wretched
abodes
of
vice
and
misery
and
sometimes
she
went
where
they
dared
not
follow
they
even
succeeded
in
establishing
in
several
places
where
such
a
thing
might
least
have
been
expected
but
these
meetings
soon
became
the
most
noisy
shouting
ranting
and
boisterous
of
gatherings
where
they
became
delirious
with
excitement
and
then
exhausted
from
such
meetings
isabel
had
not
much
sympathy
with
at
best
but
one
evening
she
attended
one
of
them
where
the
members
of
it
in
a
fit
of
ecstasy
jumped
upon
her
cloak
in
such
a
manner
as
to
drag
her
to
the
then
thinking
she
had
fallen
in
a
spiritual
trance
they
increased
their
glorifications
on
her
account
shouting
stamping
and
clapping
of
hands
rejoicing
so
much
over
her
spirit
and
so
entirely
overlooking
her
body
that
she
suffered
much
both
from
fear
and
bruises
and
ever
after
refused
to
attend
any
more
such
meetings
doubting
much
whether
god
had
any
thing
to
do
with
such
worship
the
matthias
delusion
we
now
come
to
an
eventful
period
in
the
life
of
isabella
as
identified
with
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
religious
delusions
of
modern
times
but
the
limits
prescribed
for
the
present
work
forbid
a
minute
narration
of
all
the
occurrences
that
transpired
in
relation
to
it
after
she
had
joined
the
african
church
in
church
street
and
during
her
membership
there
she
frequently
attended
meetings
at
one
of
which
smith
invited
her
to
go
to
a
or
to
instruct
the
girls
at
the
magdalene
asylum
bowery
hill
then
under
the
protection
of
pierson
and
some
other
persons
chiefly
respectable
females
to
reach
the
asylum
isabella
called
on
katy
pierson
colored
servant
of
whom
she
had
some
knowledge
pierson
saw
her
there
conversed
with
her
asked
her
if
she
had
been
baptized
and
was
answered
characteristically
the
holy
ghost
after
this
isabella
saw
katy
several
times
and
occasionally
pierson
who
engaged
her
to
keep
his
house
while
katy
went
to
virginia
to
see
her
children
this
engagement
was
considered
an
answer
to
a
prayer
by
pierson
who
had
both
fasted
and
prayed
on
the
subject
while
katy
and
isabella
appeared
to
see
in
it
the
hand
of
god
pierson
was
characterized
by
a
strong
devotional
spirit
which
finally
became
highly
fanatical
he
assumed
the
title
of
prophet
asserting
that
god
had
called
him
in
an
omnibus
in
these
words
are
elijah
the
tishbite
gather
unto
me
all
the
members
of
israel
at
the
foot
of
mount
carmel
which
he
understood
as
meaning
the
gathering
of
his
friends
at
bowery
hill
not
long
afterward
he
became
acquainted
with
the
notorious
matthias
whose
career
was
as
extraordinary
as
it
was
brief
robert
matthews
or
matthias
as
he
was
usually
called
was
of
scotch
extraction
but
a
native
of
washington
county
new
york
and
at
that
time
about
years
of
age
he
was
religiously
brought
up
among
the
a
sect
of
presbyterians
the
clergyman
the
rev
bevridge
visiting
the
family
after
the
manner
of
the
church
and
being
pleased
with
robert
put
his
hand
on
his
head
when
a
boy
and
pronounced
a
blessing
and
this
blessing
with
his
natural
qualities
determined
his
character
for
he
ever
after
thought
he
should
be
a
distinguished
man
matthias
was
brought
up
a
farmer
till
nearly
eighteen
years
of
age
but
acquired
indirectly
the
art
of
a
carpenter
without
any
regular
apprenticeship
and
showed
considerable
mechanical
skill
he
obtained
property
from
his
uncle
robert
thompson
and
then
he
went
into
business
as
a
was
considered
respectable
and
became
a
member
of
the
scotch
presbyterian
church
he
married
in
and
continued
in
business
in
cambridge
in
he
ruined
himself
by
a
building
speculation
and
the
derangement
of
the
currency
which
denied
bank
facilities
and
soon
after
he
came
to
new
york
with
his
family
and
worked
at
his
trade
he
afterwards
removed
to
albany
and
became
a
hearer
at
the
dutch
reformed
church
then
under
ludlow
charge
he
was
frequently
much
excited
on
religious
subjects
in
he
was
well
known
if
not
for
street
preaching
for
loud
discussions
and
pavement
exhortations
but
he
did
not
make
set
sermons
in
the
beginning
of
he
was
only
considered
zealous
but
in
the
same
year
he
prophesied
the
destruction
of
the
albanians
and
their
capital
and
while
preparing
to
shave
with
the
bible
before
him
he
suddenly
put
down
the
soap
and
exclaimed
have
found
it
i
have
found
a
text
which
proves
that
no
man
who
shaves
his
beard
can
be
a
true
christian
and
shortly
afterwards
without
shaving
he
went
to
the
mission
house
to
deliver
an
address
which
he
had
promised
and
in
this
address
he
proclaimed
his
new
character
pronounced
vengeance
on
the
land
and
that
the
law
of
god
was
the
only
rule
of
government
and
that
he
was
commanded
to
take
possession
of
the
world
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
kings
his
harangue
was
cut
short
by
the
trustees
putting
out
the
lights
about
this
time
matthias
laid
by
his
implements
of
industry
and
in
june
he
advised
his
wife
to
fly
with
him
from
the
destruction
which
awaited
them
in
the
city
and
on
her
refusal
partly
on
account
of
matthias
calling
himself
a
jew
whom
she
was
unwilling
to
retain
as
a
husband
he
left
her
taking
some
of
the
children
to
his
sister
in
argyle
forty
miles
from
albany
at
argyle
he
entered
the
church
and
interrupted
the
minister
declaring
the
congregation
in
darkness
and
warning
them
to
repentance
he
was
of
course
taken
out
of
the
church
and
as
he
was
advertised
in
the
albany
papers
he
was
sent
back
to
his
family
his
beard
had
now
obtained
a
respectable
length
and
thus
he
attracted
attention
and
easily
obtained
an
audience
in
the
streets
for
this
he
was
sometimes
arrested
once
by
mistake
for
adam
paine
who
collected
the
crowd
and
then
left
matthias
with
it
on
the
approach
of
the
officers
he
repeatedly
urged
his
wife
to
accompany
him
on
a
mission
to
convert
the
world
declaring
that
food
could
be
obtained
from
the
roots
of
the
forest
if
not
administered
otherwise
at
this
time
he
assumed
the
name
of
matthias
called
himself
a
jew
and
set
out
on
a
mission
taking
a
western
course
and
visiting
a
brother
at
rochester
a
skillful
mechanic
since
dead
leaving
his
brother
he
proceeded
on
his
mission
over
the
northern
states
occasionally
returning
to
albany
after
visiting
washington
and
passing
through
pennsylvania
he
came
to
new
york
his
appearance
at
that
time
was
mean
but
grotesque
and
his
sentiments
were
but
little
known
on
may
the
he
first
called
on
pierson
in
fourth
street
in
his
absence
isabella
was
alone
in
the
house
in
which
she
had
lived
since
the
previous
autumn
on
opening
the
door
she
for
the
first
time
beheld
matthias
and
her
early
impression
of
seeing
jesus
in
the
flesh
rushed
to
her
mind
she
heard
his
inquiry
and
invited
him
into
the
parlor
and
being
naturally
curious
and
much
excited
and
possessing
a
good
deal
of
tact
she
drew
him
into
conversation
stated
her
own
opinions
and
heard
his
replies
and
explanations
her
faith
was
at
first
staggered
by
his
declaring
himself
a
jew
but
on
this
point
she
was
relieved
by
his
saying
you
not
remember
how
jesus
prayed
and
repeated
part
of
the
lord
prayer
in
proof
that
the
father
kingdom
was
to
come
and
not
the
son
she
then
understood
him
to
be
a
converted
jew
and
in
the
conclusion
she
says
she
as
if
god
had
sent
him
to
set
up
the
kingdom
thus
matthias
at
once
secured
the
good
will
of
isabella
and
we
may
supposed
obtained
from
her
some
information
in
relation
to
pierson
especially
that
pierson
declared
there
was
no
true
church
and
approved
of
pierson
preaching
matthias
left
the
house
promising
to
return
on
saturday
evening
at
this
time
had
not
seen
matthias
isabella
desirous
of
hearing
the
expected
conversation
between
matthias
and
pierson
on
saturday
hurried
her
work
got
it
finished
and
was
permitted
to
be
present
indeed
the
sameness
of
belief
made
her
familiar
with
her
employer
while
her
attention
to
her
work
and
characteristic
faithfulness
increased
his
confidence
this
intimacy
the
result
of
holding
the
same
faith
and
the
principle
afterwards
adopted
of
having
but
one
table
and
all
things
in
common
made
her
at
once
the
domestic
and
the
equal
and
the
depositary
of
very
curious
if
not
valuable
information
to
this
object
even
her
color
assisted
persons
who
have
traveled
in
the
south
know
the
manner
in
which
the
colored
people
and
especially
slaves
are
treated
they
are
scarcely
regarded
as
being
present
this
trait
in
our
american
character
has
been
frequently
noticed
by
foreign
travelers
one
english
lady
remarks
that
she
discovered
in
course
of
conversation
with
a
southern
married
gentleman
that
a
colored
girl
slept
in
his
bedroom
in
which
also
was
his
wife
and
when
he
saw
that
it
occasioned
some
surprise
he
remarked
would
he
do
if
he
wanted
a
glass
of
water
in
the
night
other
travelers
have
remarked
that
the
presence
of
colored
people
never
seemed
to
interrupt
a
conversation
of
any
kind
for
one
moment
isabella
then
was
present
at
the
first
interview
between
matthias
and
pierson
at
this
interview
pierson
asked
matthias
if
he
had
a
family
to
which
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
he
asked
him
about
his
beard
and
he
gave
a
scriptural
reason
asserting
also
that
the
jews
did
not
shave
and
that
adam
had
a
beard
pierson
detailed
to
matthias
his
experience
and
matthias
gave
his
and
they
mutually
discovered
that
they
held
the
same
sentiments
both
admitting
the
direct
influence
of
the
spirit
and
the
transmission
of
spirits
from
one
body
to
another
matthias
admitted
the
call
of
pierson
in
the
omnibus
in
wall
street
which
on
this
occasion
he
gave
in
these
words
art
elijah
the
tishbite
and
thou
shalt
go
before
me
in
the
spirit
and
power
of
elias
to
prepare
my
way
before
me
and
pierson
admitted
matthias
call
who
completed
his
declaration
on
the
of
june
in
argyle
which
by
a
curious
coincidence
was
the
very
day
on
which
pierson
had
received
his
call
in
the
omnibus
such
singular
coincidences
have
a
powerful
effect
on
excited
minds
from
that
discovery
pierson
and
matthias
rejoiced
in
each
other
and
became
kindred
however
claiming
to
be
the
father
or
to
possess
the
spirit
of
the
was
god
upon
the
earth
because
the
spirit
of
god
dwelt
in
him
while
pierson
then
understood
that
his
mission
was
like
that
of
john
the
baptist
which
the
name
elias
meant
this
conference
ended
with
an
invitation
to
supper
and
matthias
and
pierson
washing
each
other
feet
pierson
preached
on
the
following
sunday
but
after
which
he
declined
in
favor
of
matthias
and
some
of
the
party
believed
that
the
had
then
come
as
a
specimen
of
matthias
preaching
and
sentiments
the
following
is
said
to
be
reliable
spirit
that
built
the
tower
of
babel
is
now
in
the
is
the
spirit
of
the
devil
the
spirit
of
man
never
goes
upon
the
clouds
all
who
think
so
are
babylonians
the
only
heaven
is
on
earth
all
who
are
ignorant
of
truth
are
ninevites
the
jews
did
not
crucify
it
was
the
gentiles
every
jew
has
his
guardian
angel
attending
him
in
this
world
god
do
speak
through
preachers
he
speaks
through
me
his
john
the
baptist
addressing
pierson
read
the
tenth
chapter
of
revelations
after
the
reading
of
the
chapter
the
prophet
resumed
speaking
as
follows
is
the
kingdom
which
is
to
spread
all
over
the
earth
our
creed
is
truth
and
no
man
can
find
truth
unless
he
obeys
john
the
baptist
and
comes
clean
into
the
church
real
men
will
be
saved
all
mock
men
will
be
damned
when
a
person
has
the
holy
ghost
then
he
is
a
man
and
not
till
then
they
who
teach
women
are
of
the
wicked
the
communion
is
all
nonsense
so
is
prayer
eating
a
nip
of
bread
and
drinking
a
little
wine
wo
do
any
good
all
who
admit
members
into
their
church
and
suffer
them
to
hold
their
lands
and
houses
their
sentence
is
depart
ye
wicked
i
know
you
not
all
females
who
lecture
their
husbands
their
sentence
is
the
same
the
sons
of
truth
are
to
enjoy
all
the
good
things
of
this
world
and
must
use
their
means
to
bring
it
about
every
thing
that
has
the
smell
of
woman
will
be
destroyed
woman
is
the
capsheaf
of
the
abomination
of
of
all
deviltry
in
a
short
time
the
world
will
take
fire
and
dissolve
it
is
combustible
already
all
women
not
obedient
had
better
become
so
as
soon
as
possible
and
let
the
wicked
spirit
depart
and
become
temples
of
truth
praying
is
all
mocking
when
you
see
any
one
wring
the
neck
of
a
fowl
instead
of
cutting
off
its
head
he
has
not
got
the
holy
ghost
cutting
gives
the
least
pain
who
eat
swine
flesh
are
of
the
devil
and
just
as
certain
as
he
eats
it
he
will
tell
a
lie
in
less
than
half
an
hour
if
you
eat
a
piece
of
pork
it
will
go
crooked
through
you
and
the
holy
ghost
will
not
stay
in
you
but
one
or
the
other
must
leave
the
house
pretty
soon
the
pork
will
be
as
crooked
in
you
as
ram
horns
and
as
great
a
nuisance
as
the
hogs
in
the
street
cholera
is
not
the
right
word
it
is
choler
which
means
wrath
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
are
now
in
this
world
they
did
not
go
up
in
the
clouds
as
some
should
they
go
there
they
do
want
to
go
there
to
box
the
compass
from
one
place
to
another
the
christians
are
for
setting
up
the
son
kingdom
it
is
not
his
it
is
the
father
kingdom
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
man
in
the
country
who
took
his
son
in
business
and
had
his
sign
made
hitchcock
son
but
the
son
wanted
it
hitchcock
father
that
is
the
way
with
your
christians
they
talk
of
the
son
kingdom
first
and
not
the
father
kingdom
matthias
and
his
disciples
at
this
time
did
not
believe
in
a
resurrection
of
the
body
but
that
the
spirits
of
the
former
saints
would
enter
the
bodies
of
the
present
generation
and
thus
begin
heaven
on
earth
of
which
he
and
pierson
were
the
first
fruits
matthias
made
the
residence
of
pierson
his
own
but
the
latter
being
apprehensive
of
popular
violence
in
his
house
if
matthias
remained
there
proposed
a
monthly
allowance
to
him
and
advised
him
to
occupy
another
dwelling
matthias
accordingly
took
a
house
in
clarkson
street
and
then
sent
for
his
family
at
albany
but
they
declined
coming
to
the
city
however
his
brother
george
complied
with
a
similar
offer
bringing
his
family
with
him
where
they
found
very
comfortable
quarters
isabella
was
employed
to
do
the
housework
in
may
matthias
left
his
house
and
placed
the
furniture
part
of
which
was
isabella
elsewhere
living
himself
at
the
hotel
corner
of
marketfield
and
west
streets
isabella
found
employment
at
whiting
canal
street
and
did
the
washing
for
matthias
by
whiting
permission
of
the
subsequent
removal
of
matthias
to
the
farm
and
residence
of
folger
at
sing
sing
where
he
was
joined
by
pierson
and
others
laboring
under
a
similar
religious
sudden
melancholy
and
somewhat
suspicious
death
of
pierson
and
the
arrest
of
matthias
on
the
charge
of
his
murder
ending
in
a
verdict
of
not
criminal
connection
that
subsisted
between
matthias
folger
and
other
members
of
the
as
final
dispersion
of
this
deluded
company
and
the
voluntary
exilement
of
matthias
in
the
far
west
after
his
c
we
do
not
deem
it
useful
or
necessary
to
give
any
particulars
those
who
are
curious
to
know
what
there
transpired
are
referred
to
a
work
published
in
new
york
in
entitled
its
sources
and
influence
illustrated
by
the
simple
narrative
of
isabella
in
the
case
of
matthias
and
folger
pierson
mills
catharine
isabella
by
vale
roosevelt
street
suffice
it
to
say
that
while
isabella
was
a
member
of
the
household
at
sing
sing
doing
much
laborious
service
in
the
spirit
of
religious
disinterestedness
and
gradually
getting
her
vision
purged
and
her
mind
cured
of
its
illusions
she
happily
escaped
the
contamination
that
surrounded
her
endeavoring
to
discharge
all
her
duties
in
a
becoming
manner
fasting
when
isabella
resided
with
pierson
he
was
in
the
habit
of
fasting
every
friday
not
eating
or
drinking
anything
from
thursday
evening
to
six
on
friday
evening
then
again
he
would
fast
two
nights
and
three
days
neither
eating
nor
drinking
refusing
himself
even
a
cup
of
cold
water
till
the
third
day
at
night
when
he
took
supper
again
as
usual
isabella
asked
him
why
he
fasted
he
answered
that
fasting
gave
him
great
light
in
the
things
of
god
which
answer
gave
birth
to
the
following
train
of
thought
in
the
mind
of
his
auditor
if
fasting
will
give
light
inwardly
and
spiritually
i
need
it
as
much
as
any
body
i
fast
too
if
pierson
needs
to
fast
two
nights
and
three
days
then
i
who
need
light
more
than
he
does
ought
to
fast
more
and
i
will
fast
three
nights
and
three
days
this
resolution
she
carried
out
to
the
letter
putting
not
so
much
as
a
drop
of
water
in
her
mouth
for
three
whole
days
and
nights
the
fourth
morning
as
she
arose
to
her
feet
not
having
the
power
to
stand
she
fell
to
the
floor
but
recovering
herself
sufficiently
she
made
her
way
to
the
pantry
and
feeling
herself
quite
voracious
and
fearing
that
she
might
now
offend
god
by
her
voracity
compelled
herself
to
breakfast
on
dry
bread
and
a
large
loaf
before
she
felt
at
all
stayed
or
satisfied
she
says
she
did
get
light
but
it
was
all
in
her
body
and
none
in
her
this
lightness
of
body
lasted
a
long
time
oh
she
was
so
light
and
felt
so
well
she
could
around
like
a
gull
the
cause
of
her
leaving
the
city
the
first
years
spent
by
isabella
in
the
city
she
accumulated
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
all
her
wants
and
she
placed
all
the
overplus
in
the
savings
bank
afterwards
while
living
with
pierson
he
prevailed
on
her
to
take
it
all
thence
and
invest
it
in
a
common
fund
which
he
was
about
establishing
as
a
fund
to
be
drawn
from
by
all
the
faithful
the
faithful
of
course
were
the
handful
that
should
subscribe
to
his
peculiar
creed
this
fund
commenced
by
pierson
afterwards
became
part
and
parcel
of
the
kingdom
of
which
matthias
assumed
to
be
head
and
at
the
breaking
up
of
the
kingdom
her
little
property
was
merged
in
the
general
went
to
enrich
those
who
profited
by
the
loss
of
others
if
any
such
there
were
pierson
and
others
had
so
assured
her
that
the
fund
would
supply
all
her
wants
at
all
times
and
in
all
emergencies
and
to
the
end
of
life
that
she
became
perfectly
careless
on
the
for
no
interest
when
she
drew
her
money
from
the
bank
and
taking
no
account
of
the
sum
she
placed
in
the
fund
she
recovered
a
few
articles
of
the
furniture
from
the
wreck
of
the
kingdom
and
received
a
small
sum
of
money
from
folger
as
the
price
of
folger
attempt
to
convict
her
of
murder
with
this
to
start
upon
she
commenced
anew
her
labors
in
the
hope
of
yet
being
able
to
accumulate
a
sufficiency
to
make
a
little
home
for
herself
in
her
advancing
age
with
this
stimulus
before
her
she
toiled
hard
working
early
and
late
doing
a
great
deal
for
a
little
money
and
turning
her
hand
to
almost
anything
that
promised
good
pay
still
she
did
not
prosper
and
somehow
could
not
contrive
to
lay
by
a
single
dollar
for
a
day
when
this
had
been
the
state
of
her
affairs
some
time
she
suddenly
paused
and
taking
a
retrospective
view
of
what
had
passed
inquired
within
herself
why
it
was
that
for
all
her
unwearied
labors
she
had
nothing
to
show
why
it
was
that
others
with
much
less
care
and
labor
could
hoard
up
treasures
for
themselves
and
children
she
became
more
and
more
convinced
as
she
reasoned
that
every
thing
she
had
undertaken
in
the
city
of
new
york
had
finally
proved
a
failure
and
where
her
hopes
had
been
raised
the
highest
there
she
felt
the
failure
had
been
the
greatest
and
the
disappointment
most
severe
after
turning
it
in
her
mind
for
some
time
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
been
taking
part
in
a
great
drama
which
was
in
itself
but
one
great
system
of
robbery
and
wrong
she
said
rich
rob
the
poor
and
the
poor
rob
one
another
true
she
had
not
received
labor
from
others
and
stinted
their
pay
as
she
felt
had
been
practised
against
her
but
she
had
taken
their
work
from
them
which
was
their
only
means
to
get
money
and
was
the
same
to
them
in
the
end
for
gentleman
where
she
lived
would
give
her
a
dollar
to
hire
a
poor
man
to
clear
the
snow
from
the
steps
and
she
would
arise
early
and
perform
the
labor
herself
putting
the
money
into
her
own
pocket
a
poor
man
would
come
along
saying
she
ought
to
have
let
him
have
the
job
he
was
poor
and
needed
the
pay
for
his
family
she
would
harden
her
heart
against
him
and
am
poor
too
and
i
need
it
for
mine
but
in
her
retrospection
she
thought
of
all
the
misery
she
might
have
been
adding
to
in
her
selfish
grasping
and
it
troubled
her
conscience
sorely
and
this
insensibility
to
the
claims
of
human
brotherhood
and
the
wants
of
the
destitute
and
wretched
poor
she
now
saw
as
she
never
had
done
before
to
be
unfeeling
selfish
and
wicked
these
reflections
and
convictions
gave
rise
to
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
in
the
heart
of
isabella
and
she
began
to
look
upon
money
and
property
with
great
indifference
if
not
at
that
time
unable
probably
to
discern
any
difference
between
a
miserly
grasping
at
and
hoarding
of
money
and
means
and
a
true
use
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
for
one
own
comfort
and
the
relief
of
such
as
she
might
be
enabled
to
befriend
and
assist
one
thing
she
was
sure
the
precepts
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
others
should
do
unto
you
your
neighbor
as
yourself
and
so
forth
were
maxims
that
had
been
but
little
thought
of
by
herself
or
practised
by
those
about
her
her
next
decision
was
that
she
must
leave
the
city
it
was
no
place
for
her
yea
she
felt
called
in
spirit
to
leave
it
and
to
travel
east
and
lecture
she
had
never
been
further
east
than
the
city
neither
had
she
any
friends
there
of
whom
she
had
particular
reason
to
expect
any
thing
yet
to
her
it
was
plain
that
her
mission
lay
in
the
east
and
that
she
would
find
friends
there
she
determined
on
leaving
but
these
determinations
and
convictions
she
kept
close
locked
in
her
own
breast
knowing
that
if
her
children
and
friends
were
aware
of
it
they
would
make
such
an
ado
about
it
as
would
render
it
very
unpleasant
if
not
distressing
to
all
parties
having
made
what
preparations
for
leaving
she
deemed
necessary
was
to
put
up
a
few
articles
of
clothing
in
a
all
else
being
deemed
an
unnecessary
incumbrance
an
hour
before
she
left
she
informed
whiting
the
woman
of
the
house
where
she
was
stopping
that
her
name
was
no
longer
isabella
but
sojourner
and
that
she
was
going
east
and
to
her
inquiry
are
you
going
east
for
her
answer
was
spirit
calls
me
there
and
i
must
go
she
left
the
city
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
crossing
over
to
brooklyn
and
taking
the
rising
sun
for
her
only
compass
and
guide
she
lot
wife
and
hoping
to
avoid
her
fate
she
resolved
not
to
look
back
till
she
felt
sure
the
wicked
city
from
which
she
was
fleeing
was
left
too
far
behind
to
be
visible
in
the
distance
and
when
she
first
ventured
to
look
back
she
could
just
discern
the
blue
cloud
of
smoke
that
hung
over
it
and
she
thanked
the
lord
that
she
was
thus
far
removed
from
what
seemed
to
her
a
second
sodom
she
was
now
fairly
started
on
her
pilgrimage
her
bundle
in
one
hand
and
a
little
basket
of
provisions
in
the
other
and
two
york
shillings
in
her
heart
strong
in
the
faith
that
her
true
work
lay
before
her
and
that
the
lord
was
her
director
and
she
doubted
not
he
would
provide
for
and
protect
her
and
that
it
would
be
very
censurable
in
her
to
burden
herself
with
any
thing
more
than
a
moderate
supply
for
her
then
present
needs
her
mission
was
not
merely
to
travel
east
but
to
as
she
designated
it
of
the
hope
that
was
in
the
people
to
embrace
jesus
and
refrain
from
sin
the
nature
and
origin
of
which
she
explained
to
them
in
accordance
with
her
own
most
curious
and
original
views
through
her
life
and
all
its
chequered
changes
she
has
ever
clung
fast
to
her
first
permanent
impressions
on
religious
subjects
wherever
night
overtook
her
there
she
sought
for
if
she
not
she
paid
at
a
tavern
if
she
chanced
to
be
at
not
at
a
private
dwelling
with
the
rich
if
they
would
receive
not
with
the
poor
but
she
soon
discovered
that
the
largest
houses
were
nearly
always
full
if
not
quite
full
company
was
soon
expected
and
that
it
was
much
easier
to
find
an
unoccupied
corner
in
a
small
house
than
in
a
large
one
and
if
a
person
possessed
but
a
miserable
roof
over
his
head
you
might
be
sure
of
a
welcome
to
part
of
it
but
this
she
had
penetration
enough
to
see
was
quite
as
much
the
effect
of
a
want
of
sympathy
as
of
benevolence
and
this
was
also
very
apparent
in
her
religious
conversations
with
people
who
were
strangers
to
her
she
said
never
could
find
out
that
the
rich
had
any
religion
if
i
had
been
rich
and
accomplished
i
could
for
the
rich
could
always
find
religion
in
the
rich
and
i
could
find
it
among
the
poor
at
first
she
attended
such
meetings
as
she
heard
of
in
the
vicinity
of
her
travels
and
spoke
to
the
people
as
she
found
them
assembled
afterwards
she
advertised
meetings
of
her
own
and
held
forth
to
large
audiences
having
as
she
said
good
time
when
she
became
weary
of
travelling
and
wished
a
place
to
stop
a
while
and
rest
herself
she
said
some
opening
for
her
was
always
near
at
hand
and
the
first
time
she
needed
rest
a
man
accosted
her
as
she
was
walking
inquiring
if
she
was
looking
for
work
she
told
him
that
was
not
the
object
of
her
travels
but
that
she
would
willingly
work
a
few
days
if
any
one
wanted
he
requested
her
to
go
to
his
family
who
were
sadly
in
want
of
assistance
which
he
had
been
thus
far
unable
to
supply
she
went
to
the
house
where
she
was
directed
and
was
received
by
his
family
one
of
whom
was
ill
as
a
and
when
she
felt
constrained
to
resume
her
journey
they
were
very
sorry
and
would
fain
have
detained
her
longer
but
as
she
urged
the
necessity
of
leaving
they
offered
her
what
seemed
in
her
eyes
a
great
deal
of
money
as
a
remuneration
for
her
labor
and
an
expression
of
their
gratitude
for
her
opportune
assistance
but
she
would
only
receive
a
very
little
of
it
enough
as
she
says
to
enable
her
to
pay
tribute
to
caesar
if
it
was
demanded
of
her
and
two
or
three
york
shillings
at
a
time
were
all
she
allowed
herself
to
take
and
then
with
purse
replenished
and
strength
renewed
she
would
once
more
set
out
to
perform
her
mission
the
consequences
of
refusing
a
traveller
a
night
lodging
as
she
drew
near
the
center
of
the
island
she
commenced
one
evening
at
nightfall
to
solicit
the
favor
of
a
night
lodging
she
had
repeated
her
request
a
great
many
it
seemed
to
her
some
twenty
times
and
as
many
times
she
received
a
negative
answer
she
walked
on
the
stars
and
the
tiny
horns
of
the
new
moon
shed
but
a
dim
light
on
her
lonely
way
when
she
was
familiarly
accosted
by
two
indians
who
took
her
for
an
acquaintance
she
told
them
they
were
mistaken
in
the
person
she
was
a
stranger
there
and
asked
them
the
direction
to
a
tavern
they
informed
her
it
was
yet
a
long
two
miles
or
so
and
inquired
if
she
were
alone
not
wishing
for
their
protection
or
knowing
what
might
be
the
character
of
their
kindness
she
answered
not
exactly
and
passed
on
at
the
end
of
a
weary
way
she
came
to
the
tavern
rather
to
a
large
building
which
was
occupied
as
a
tavern
and
jail
on
asking
for
a
night
lodging
was
informed
she
could
stay
if
she
would
consent
to
be
locked
in
this
to
her
mind
was
an
insuperable
objection
to
have
a
key
turned
on
her
was
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
at
least
not
to
be
endured
and
she
again
took
up
her
line
of
march
preferring
to
walk
beneath
the
open
sky
to
being
locked
up
by
a
stranger
in
such
a
place
she
had
not
walked
far
before
she
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
under
an
open
shed
she
ventured
to
accost
her
and
inquired
if
she
knew
where
she
could
get
in
for
the
night
the
woman
answered
that
she
did
not
unless
she
went
home
with
them
and
turning
to
her
man
asked
him
if
the
stranger
could
not
share
their
home
for
the
night
to
which
he
cheerfully
assented
sojourner
thought
it
evident
he
had
been
taking
a
drop
too
much
but
as
he
was
civil
and
and
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
spend
the
night
alone
in
the
open
air
she
felt
driven
to
the
necessity
of
accepting
their
hospitality
whatever
it
might
prove
to
be
the
woman
soon
informed
her
that
there
was
a
ball
in
the
place
at
which
they
would
like
to
drop
in
a
while
before
they
went
to
their
home
balls
being
no
part
of
sojourner
mission
she
was
not
desirous
of
attending
but
her
hostess
could
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
a
taste
of
it
and
she
was
forced
to
go
with
her
or
relinquish
their
company
at
once
in
which
move
there
might
be
more
exposure
than
in
accompanying
her
she
went
and
soon
found
herself
surrounded
by
an
assemblage
of
people
collected
from
the
very
dregs
of
society
too
ignorant
and
degraded
to
understand
much
less
entertain
a
high
or
bright
idea
a
dirty
hovel
destitute
of
every
comfort
and
where
the
fumes
of
whiskey
were
abundant
and
powerful
sojourner
guide
there
was
too
much
charmed
with
the
combined
entertainments
of
the
place
to
be
able
to
tear
herself
away
till
she
found
her
faculties
for
enjoyment
failing
her
from
a
too
free
use
of
liquor
and
she
betook
herself
to
bed
till
she
could
recover
them
sojourner
seated
in
a
corner
had
time
for
many
reflections
and
refrained
from
lecturing
them
in
obedience
to
the
recommendation
not
your
pearls
when
the
night
was
far
spent
the
husband
of
the
sleeping
woman
aroused
the
sleeper
and
reminded
her
that
she
was
not
very
polite
to
the
woman
she
had
invited
to
sleep
at
her
house
and
of
the
propriety
of
returning
home
they
once
more
emerged
into
the
pure
air
which
to
our
friend
sojourner
after
so
long
breathing
the
noisome
air
of
the
was
most
refreshing
and
grateful
just
as
day
dawned
they
reached
the
place
they
called
their
home
sojourner
now
saw
that
she
had
lost
nothing
in
the
shape
of
rest
by
remaining
so
long
at
the
ball
as
their
miserable
cabin
afforded
but
one
bunk
or
pallet
for
sleeping
and
had
there
been
many
such
she
would
have
preferred
sitting
up
all
night
to
occupying
one
like
it
they
very
politely
offered
her
the
bed
if
she
would
use
it
but
civilly
declining
she
waited
for
morning
with
an
eagerness
of
desire
she
never
felt
before
on
the
subject
and
was
never
more
happy
than
when
the
eye
of
day
shed
its
golden
light
once
more
over
the
earth
she
was
once
more
free
and
while
daylight
should
last
independent
and
needed
no
invitation
to
pursue
her
journey
let
these
facts
teach
us
that
every
pedestrian
in
the
world
is
not
a
vagabond
and
that
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
compel
any
one
to
receive
that
hospitality
from
the
vicious
and
abandoned
which
they
should
have
received
from
us
thousands
can
testify
who
have
thus
been
caught
in
the
snares
of
the
wicked
the
fourth
of
july
isabella
arrived
at
huntingdon
from
thence
she
went
to
cold
springs
where
she
found
the
people
making
preparations
for
a
mass
with
her
usual
alacrity
she
entered
into
their
labors
getting
up
dishes
a
la
new
york
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
those
she
assisted
after
remaining
at
cold
springs
some
three
weeks
she
returned
to
huntingdon
where
she
took
boat
for
connecticut
landing
at
bridgeport
she
again
resumed
her
travels
towards
the
lecturing
some
and
working
some
to
get
wherewith
to
pay
tribute
to
caesar
as
she
called
it
and
in
this
manner
she
presently
came
to
the
city
of
new
haven
where
she
found
many
meetings
which
she
some
of
which
she
was
allowed
to
express
her
views
freely
and
without
reservation
she
also
called
meetings
expressly
to
give
herself
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
found
in
the
city
many
true
friends
of
jesus
as
she
judged
with
whom
she
held
communion
of
spirit
having
no
preference
for
one
sect
more
than
another
but
being
well
satisfied
with
all
who
gave
her
evidence
of
having
known
or
loved
the
saviour
after
thus
delivering
her
testimony
in
this
pleasant
city
feeling
she
had
not
as
yet
found
an
abiding
place
she
went
from
thence
to
bristol
at
the
request
of
a
zealous
sister
who
desired
her
to
go
to
the
latter
place
and
hold
a
religious
conversation
with
some
friends
of
hers
there
she
went
as
requested
found
the
people
kindly
and
religiously
disposed
and
through
them
she
became
acquainted
with
several
very
interesting
persons
a
brother
in
bristol
becoming
interested
in
her
new
views
and
original
opinions
requested
as
a
favor
that
she
would
go
to
hartford
to
see
and
converse
with
friends
of
his
there
standing
ready
to
perform
any
service
in
the
lord
she
went
to
hartford
as
desired
bearing
in
her
hand
the
following
note
from
this
brother
send
you
this
living
messenger
as
i
believe
her
to
be
one
that
god
loves
ethiopia
is
stretching
forth
her
hands
unto
god
you
can
see
by
this
sister
that
god
does
by
his
spirit
alone
teach
his
own
children
things
to
come
please
receive
her
and
she
will
tell
you
some
new
things
let
her
tell
her
story
without
interrupting
her
and
give
close
attention
and
you
will
see
she
has
got
the
lever
of
truth
that
god
helps
her
to
pry
where
but
few
can
she
can
not
read
or
write
but
the
law
is
in
her
heart
her
to
brother
brother
and
where
she
can
do
the
most
good
your
brother
l
b
some
of
her
views
and
reasonings
as
soon
as
isabella
saw
god
as
an
spirit
she
became
desirous
of
hearing
all
that
had
been
written
of
him
and
listened
to
the
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
its
first
inhabitants
as
contained
in
the
first
chapters
of
genesis
with
peculiar
interest
for
some
time
she
received
it
all
literally
though
it
appeared
strange
to
her
that
worked
by
the
day
got
tired
and
stopped
to
rest
but
after
a
little
time
she
began
to
reason
upon
it
if
god
works
by
the
day
and
one
day
work
tires
him
and
he
is
obliged
to
rest
either
from
weariness
or
on
account
of
darkness
or
if
he
waited
for
the
cool
of
the
day
to
walk
in
the
garden
because
he
was
inconvenienced
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
why
then
it
seems
that
god
can
not
do
as
much
as
i
can
for
i
can
bear
the
sun
at
noon
and
work
several
days
and
nights
in
succession
without
being
much
tired
or
if
he
rested
nights
because
of
the
darkness
it
is
very
queer
that
he
should
make
the
night
so
dark
that
he
could
not
see
himself
if
i
had
been
god
i
would
have
made
the
night
light
enough
for
my
own
convenience
surely
but
the
moment
she
placed
this
idea
of
god
by
the
side
of
the
impression
she
had
once
so
suddenly
received
of
his
inconceivable
greatness
and
entire
spirituality
that
moment
she
exclaimed
mentally
god
does
not
stop
to
rest
for
he
is
a
spirit
and
can
not
tire
he
can
not
want
for
light
for
he
hath
all
light
in
himself
and
if
god
is
all
in
all
and
worketh
all
in
all
as
i
have
heard
them
read
then
it
is
impossible
he
should
rest
at
all
for
if
he
did
every
other
thing
would
stop
and
rest
too
the
waters
would
not
flow
and
the
fishes
could
not
swim
and
all
motion
must
cease
god
could
have
no
pauses
in
his
work
and
he
needed
no
sabbaths
of
rest
man
might
need
them
and
he
should
take
them
when
he
needed
them
whenever
he
required
rest
as
it
regarded
the
worship
of
god
he
was
to
be
worshipped
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
and
one
portion
of
time
never
seemed
to
her
more
holy
than
another
these
views
which
were
the
results
of
the
workings
of
her
own
mind
assisted
solely
by
the
light
of
her
own
experience
and
very
limited
knowledge
were
for
a
long
time
after
their
adoption
closely
locked
in
her
own
breast
fearing
lest
their
avowal
might
bring
upon
her
the
imputation
of
usual
charge
preferred
by
all
religionists
against
those
who
entertain
religious
views
and
feelings
differing
materially
from
their
own
if
from
their
own
sad
experience
they
are
withheld
from
shouting
the
cry
of
they
fail
not
to
see
and
to
feel
ay
and
to
say
that
the
dissenters
are
not
of
the
right
spirit
and
that
their
spiritual
eyes
have
never
been
unsealed
while
travelling
in
connecticut
she
met
a
minister
with
whom
she
held
a
long
discussion
on
these
points
as
well
as
on
various
other
topics
such
as
the
origin
of
all
things
especially
the
origin
of
evil
at
the
same
time
bearing
her
testimony
strongly
against
a
paid
ministry
he
belonged
to
that
class
and
as
a
matter
of
course
as
strongly
advocated
his
own
side
of
the
question
i
had
forgotten
to
mention
in
its
proper
place
a
very
important
fact
that
when
she
was
examining
the
scriptures
she
wished
to
hear
them
without
comment
but
if
she
employed
adult
persons
to
read
them
to
her
and
she
asked
them
to
read
a
passage
over
again
they
invariably
commenced
to
explain
by
giving
her
their
version
of
it
and
in
this
way
they
tried
her
feelings
exceedingly
in
consequence
of
this
she
ceased
to
ask
adult
persons
to
read
the
bible
to
her
and
substituted
children
in
their
stead
children
as
soon
as
they
could
read
distinctly
would
the
same
sentence
to
her
as
often
as
she
wished
and
without
comment
and
in
that
way
she
was
enabled
to
see
what
her
own
mind
could
make
out
of
the
record
and
that
she
said
was
what
she
wanted
and
not
what
others
thought
it
to
mean
she
wished
to
compare
the
teachings
of
the
bible
with
the
witness
within
her
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
spirit
of
truth
spoke
in
those
records
but
that
the
recorders
of
those
truths
had
intermingled
with
them
ideas
and
suppositions
of
their
own
this
is
one
among
the
many
proofs
of
her
energy
and
independence
of
character
when
it
became
known
to
her
children
that
sojourner
had
left
new
york
they
were
filled
with
wonder
and
alarm
where
could
she
have
gone
and
why
had
she
left
were
questions
no
one
could
answer
satisfactorily
now
their
imaginations
painted
her
as
a
wandering
again
they
feared
she
had
been
left
to
commit
suicide
and
many
were
the
tears
they
shed
at
the
loss
of
her
but
when
she
reached
berlin
she
wrote
to
them
by
amanuensis
informing
them
of
her
whereabouts
and
waiting
an
answer
to
her
letter
thus
quieting
their
fears
and
gladdening
their
hearts
once
more
with
assurances
of
her
continued
life
and
her
love
the
second
advent
doctrines
in
hartford
and
vicinity
she
met
with
several
persons
who
believed
in
the
advent
doctrines
or
the
immediate
personal
appearance
of
jesus
christ
at
first
she
thought
she
had
never
heard
of
advent
but
when
it
was
explained
to
her
she
recollected
having
once
attended
miller
meeting
in
new
york
where
she
saw
a
great
many
enigmatical
pictures
hanging
on
the
wall
which
she
could
not
understand
and
which
being
out
of
the
reach
of
her
understanding
failed
to
interest
her
in
this
section
of
country
she
attended
two
of
the
believers
in
these
excitement
being
then
at
its
greatest
height
the
last
meeting
was
at
windsor
lock
the
people
as
a
matter
of
course
eagerly
inquired
of
her
concerning
her
belief
as
it
regarded
their
most
important
tenet
she
told
them
it
had
not
been
revealed
to
her
perhaps
if
she
could
read
she
might
see
it
differently
sometimes
to
their
eager
inquiry
do
you
believe
the
lord
is
coming
she
answered
believe
the
lord
is
as
near
as
he
can
be
and
not
be
it
with
these
evasive
and
answers
she
kept
their
minds
calm
as
it
respected
her
unbelief
till
she
could
have
an
opportunity
to
hear
their
views
fairly
stated
in
order
to
judge
more
understandingly
of
this
matter
and
see
if
in
her
estimation
there
was
any
good
ground
for
expecting
an
event
which
was
in
the
minds
of
so
many
as
it
were
shaking
the
very
foundations
of
the
universe
she
was
invited
to
join
them
in
their
religious
exercises
and
accepted
the
and
talking
in
her
own
peculiar
style
and
attracting
many
about
her
by
her
singing
when
she
had
convinced
the
people
that
she
was
a
lover
of
god
and
his
cause
and
had
gained
a
good
standing
with
them
so
that
she
could
get
a
hearing
among
them
she
had
become
quite
sure
in
her
own
mind
that
they
were
laboring
under
a
delusion
and
she
commenced
to
use
her
influence
to
calm
the
fears
of
the
people
and
pour
oil
upon
the
troubled
waters
in
one
part
of
the
grounds
she
found
a
knot
of
people
greatly
excited
she
mounted
a
stump
and
called
out
hear
when
the
people
had
gathered
around
her
as
they
were
in
a
state
to
listen
to
any
thing
new
she
addressed
them
as
and
asked
them
why
they
made
such
a
you
not
commanded
to
watch
and
pray
you
are
neither
watching
nor
praying
and
she
bade
them
with
the
tones
of
a
kind
mother
retire
to
their
tents
and
there
watch
and
pray
without
noise
or
tumult
for
the
lord
would
not
come
to
such
a
scene
of
confusion
lord
came
still
and
quiet
she
assured
them
lord
might
come
move
all
through
the
camp
and
go
away
again
and
they
never
know
it
in
the
state
they
then
were
they
seemed
glad
to
seize
upon
any
reason
for
being
less
agitated
and
distressed
and
many
of
them
suppressed
their
noisy
terror
and
retired
to
their
tents
to
and
pray
begging
others
to
do
the
same
and
listen
to
the
advice
of
the
good
sister
she
felt
she
had
done
some
good
and
then
went
to
listen
further
to
the
preachers
they
appeared
to
her
to
be
doing
their
utmost
to
agitate
and
excite
the
people
who
were
already
too
much
excited
and
when
she
had
listened
till
her
feelings
would
let
her
listen
silently
no
longer
she
arose
and
addressed
the
preachers
the
following
are
specimens
of
her
speech
you
are
talking
about
being
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
if
the
lord
should
come
he
change
you
to
nothing
for
there
is
nothing
to
you
seem
to
be
expecting
to
go
to
some
parlor
away
up
somewhere
and
when
the
wicked
have
been
burnt
you
are
coming
back
to
walk
in
triumph
over
their
is
to
be
your
new
jerusalem
now
i
ca
see
any
thing
so
very
nice
in
that
coming
back
to
such
a
muss
as
that
will
be
a
world
covered
with
the
ashes
of
the
wicked
besides
if
the
lord
comes
and
you
say
he
am
not
going
away
i
am
going
to
stay
here
and
stand
the
fire
like
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
and
jesus
will
walk
with
me
through
the
fire
and
keep
me
from
harm
nothing
belonging
to
god
can
burn
any
more
than
god
himself
such
shall
have
no
need
to
go
away
to
escape
the
fire
no
i
shall
remain
do
you
tell
me
that
children
ca
stand
fire
and
her
manner
and
tone
spoke
louder
than
words
saying
is
absurd
to
think
so
the
ministers
were
taken
quite
aback
at
so
unexpected
an
opposer
and
one
of
them
in
the
kindest
possible
manner
commenced
a
discussion
with
her
by
asking
her
questions
and
quoting
scripture
to
her
concluding
finally
that
although
she
had
learned
nothing
of
the
great
doctrine
which
was
so
exclusively
occupying
their
minds
at
the
time
she
had
learned
much
that
man
had
never
taught
her
at
this
meeting
she
received
the
address
of
different
persons
residing
in
various
places
with
an
invitation
to
visit
them
she
promised
to
go
soon
to
cabotville
and
started
shaping
her
course
for
that
place
she
arrived
at
springfield
one
evening
at
six
and
immediately
began
to
search
for
a
lodging
for
the
night
she
walked
from
six
till
past
nine
and
was
then
on
the
road
from
springfield
to
cabotville
before
she
found
any
one
sufficiently
hospitable
to
give
her
a
night
shelter
under
their
roof
then
a
man
gave
her
cents
and
bade
her
go
to
a
tavern
and
stay
all
night
she
did
so
returning
in
the
morning
to
thank
him
assuring
him
she
had
put
his
money
to
its
legitimate
use
she
found
a
number
of
the
friends
she
had
seen
at
windsor
when
she
reached
the
manufacturing
town
of
cabotville
which
has
lately
taken
the
name
of
chicopee
and
with
them
she
spent
a
pleasant
week
or
more
after
which
she
left
them
to
visit
the
shaker
village
in
enfield
she
now
began
to
think
of
finding
a
resting
place
at
least
for
a
season
for
she
had
performed
quite
a
long
journey
considering
she
had
walked
most
of
the
way
and
she
had
a
mind
to
look
in
upon
the
shakers
and
see
how
things
were
there
and
whether
there
was
any
opening
there
for
her
but
on
her
way
back
to
springfield
she
called
at
a
house
and
asked
for
a
piece
of
bread
her
request
was
granted
and
she
was
kindly
invited
to
tarry
all
night
as
it
was
getting
late
and
she
would
not
be
able
to
stay
at
every
house
in
that
vicinity
which
invitation
she
cheerfully
accepted
when
the
man
of
the
house
came
in
he
recollected
having
seen
her
at
the
and
repeated
some
conversations
by
which
she
recognized
him
again
he
soon
proposed
having
a
meeting
that
evening
went
out
and
notified
his
friends
and
neighbors
who
came
together
and
she
once
more
held
forth
to
them
in
her
peculiar
style
through
the
agency
of
this
meeting
she
became
acquainted
with
several
people
residing
in
springfield
to
whose
houses
she
was
cordially
invited
and
with
whom
she
spent
some
pleasant
time
one
of
these
friends
writing
of
her
arrival
there
speaks
as
follows
after
saying
that
she
and
her
people
belonged
to
that
class
of
persons
who
believed
in
the
second
advent
doctrines
and
that
this
class
believing
also
in
freedom
of
speech
and
action
often
found
at
their
meetings
many
singular
people
who
did
not
agree
with
them
in
their
principal
doctrine
and
that
being
thus
prepared
to
hear
new
and
strange
things
listened
eagerly
to
sojourner
and
drank
in
all
she
said
also
that
she
became
a
favorite
among
them
that
when
she
arose
to
speak
in
their
assemblies
her
commanding
figure
and
dignified
manner
hushed
every
trifler
into
silence
and
her
singular
and
sometimes
uncouth
modes
of
expression
never
provoked
a
laugh
but
often
were
the
whole
audience
melted
into
tears
by
her
touching
stories
she
also
adds
were
the
lessons
of
wisdom
and
faith
i
have
delighted
to
learn
from
her
continued
a
great
favorite
in
our
meetings
both
on
account
of
her
remarkable
gift
in
prayer
and
still
more
remarkable
talent
for
singing
and
the
aptness
and
point
of
her
remarks
frequently
illustrated
by
figures
the
most
original
and
expressive
we
were
walking
the
other
day
she
said
she
had
often
thought
what
a
beautiful
world
this
would
be
when
we
should
see
every
thing
right
side
up
now
we
see
every
thing
and
all
is
confusion
for
a
person
who
knows
nothing
of
this
fact
in
the
science
of
optics
this
seemed
quite
a
remarkable
idea
also
loved
her
for
her
sincere
and
ardent
piety
her
unwavering
faith
in
god
and
her
contempt
of
what
the
world
calls
fashion
and
what
we
call
folly
was
in
search
of
a
quiet
place
where
a
traveller
might
rest
she
had
heard
of
fruitlands
and
was
inclined
to
go
there
but
the
friends
she
found
here
thought
it
best
for
her
to
visit
northampton
she
passed
her
time
while
with
us
working
wherever
her
work
was
needed
and
talking
where
work
was
not
needed
would
not
receive
money
for
her
work
saying
she
worked
for
the
lord
and
if
her
wants
were
supplied
she
received
it
as
from
the
lord
remained
with
us
till
far
into
winter
when
we
introduced
her
at
the
northampton
association
wrote
to
me
from
thence
that
she
had
found
the
quiet
resting
place
she
had
so
long
desired
and
she
has
remained
there
ever
since
another
camp
meeting
when
sojourner
had
been
at
northampton
a
few
months
she
attended
another
at
which
she
performed
a
very
important
part
a
party
of
wild
young
men
with
no
motive
but
that
of
entertaining
themselves
by
annoying
and
injuring
the
feelings
of
others
had
assembled
at
the
meeting
hooting
and
yelling
and
in
various
ways
interrupting
the
services
and
causing
much
disturbance
those
who
had
the
charge
of
the
meeting
having
tried
their
persuasive
powers
in
vain
grew
impatient
and
tried
threatening
the
young
men
considering
themselves
insulted
collected
their
friends
to
the
number
of
a
hundred
or
more
dispersed
themselves
through
the
grounds
making
the
most
frightful
noises
and
threatening
to
fire
the
tents
it
was
said
the
authorities
of
the
meeting
sat
in
grave
consultation
decided
to
have
the
arrested
and
sent
for
the
constable
to
the
great
displeasure
of
some
of
the
company
who
were
opposed
to
such
an
appeal
to
force
and
arms
be
that
as
it
may
sojourner
seeing
great
consternation
depicted
in
every
countenance
caught
the
contagion
and
ere
she
was
aware
found
herself
quaking
with
fear
under
the
impulse
of
this
sudden
emotion
she
fled
to
the
most
retired
corner
of
a
tent
and
secreted
herself
behind
a
trunk
saying
to
herself
am
the
only
colored
person
here
and
on
me
probably
their
wicked
mischief
will
fall
first
and
perhaps
fatally
but
feeling
how
great
was
her
insecurity
even
there
as
the
very
tent
began
to
shake
from
its
foundations
she
began
to
soliloquise
as
follows
i
run
away
and
hide
from
the
devil
me
a
servant
of
the
living
god
have
i
not
faith
enough
to
go
out
and
quell
that
mob
when
i
know
it
is
one
shall
chase
a
thousand
and
two
put
ten
thousand
to
flight
i
know
there
are
not
a
thousand
here
and
i
know
i
am
a
servant
of
the
living
god
go
to
the
rescue
and
the
lord
shall
go
with
and
protect
me
said
she
felt
as
if
i
had
three
hearts
and
that
they
were
so
large
my
body
could
hardly
hold
them
she
now
came
forth
from
her
and
invited
several
to
go
with
her
and
see
what
they
could
do
to
still
the
raging
of
the
moral
elements
they
declined
and
considered
her
wild
to
think
of
it
the
meeting
was
in
the
open
full
moon
shed
its
saddened
light
over
the
woman
who
was
that
evening
to
address
them
was
trembling
on
the
preachers
stand
the
noise
and
confusion
were
now
terrific
sojourner
left
the
tent
alone
and
unaided
and
walking
some
thirty
rods
to
the
top
of
a
small
rise
of
ground
commenced
to
sing
in
her
most
fervid
manner
with
all
the
strength
of
her
most
powerful
voice
the
hymn
on
the
resurrection
of
it
was
early
in
the
was
early
in
the
morning
just
at
the
break
of
when
he
he
he
rose
and
went
to
heaven
on
a
cloud
all
who
have
ever
heard
her
sing
this
hymn
will
probably
remember
it
as
long
as
they
remember
her
the
hymn
the
tune
the
style
are
each
too
closely
associated
with
to
be
easily
separated
from
herself
and
when
sung
in
one
of
her
most
animated
moods
in
the
open
air
with
the
utmost
strength
of
her
most
powerful
voice
must
have
been
truly
thrilling
as
she
commenced
to
sing
the
young
men
made
a
rush
towards
her
and
she
was
immediately
encircled
by
a
dense
body
of
the
rioters
many
of
them
armed
with
sticks
or
clubs
as
their
weapons
of
defence
if
not
of
attack
as
the
circle
narrowed
around
her
she
ceased
singing
and
after
a
short
pause
inquired
in
a
gentle
but
firm
tone
do
you
come
about
me
with
clubs
and
sticks
i
am
not
doing
harm
to
any
one
a
going
to
hurt
you
old
woman
we
came
to
hear
you
sing
cried
many
voices
simultaneously
to
us
old
woman
cries
one
to
us
old
woman
says
another
old
woman
says
a
third
us
your
experience
says
a
fourth
stand
and
smoke
so
near
me
i
can
not
sing
or
talk
she
answered
back
said
several
authoritative
voices
with
not
the
most
gentle
or
courteous
accompaniments
raising
their
rude
weapons
in
the
air
the
crowd
suddenly
gave
back
the
circle
became
larger
as
many
voices
again
called
for
singing
talking
or
praying
backed
by
assurances
that
no
one
should
be
allowed
to
hurt
speakers
declaring
with
an
oath
that
they
would
down
any
person
who
should
offer
her
the
least
indignity
she
looked
about
her
and
with
her
usual
discrimination
said
must
be
many
young
men
in
all
this
assemblage
bearing
within
them
hearts
susceptible
of
good
impressions
i
will
speak
to
them
she
did
speak
they
silently
heard
and
civilly
asked
her
many
questions
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
given
her
at
the
time
to
answer
them
with
truth
and
wisdom
beyond
herself
her
speech
had
operated
on
the
roused
passions
of
the
mob
like
oil
on
agitated
waters
they
were
as
a
whole
entirely
subdued
and
only
clamored
when
she
ceased
to
speak
or
sing
those
who
stood
in
the
back
ground
after
the
circle
was
enlarged
cried
out
aloud
old
woman
we
ca
hear
those
who
held
the
sceptre
of
power
among
them
requested
that
she
should
make
a
pulpit
of
a
neighboring
wagon
she
said
i
do
they
overthrow
it
they
who
dares
hurt
you
we
knock
him
down
instantly
him
cried
the
chiefs
we
wo
no
we
wo
nobody
shall
hurt
you
answered
the
many
voices
of
the
mob
they
kindly
assisted
her
to
mount
the
wagon
from
which
she
spoke
and
sung
to
them
about
an
hour
of
all
she
said
to
them
on
the
occasion
she
remembers
only
the
following
there
are
two
congregations
on
this
ground
it
is
written
that
there
shall
be
a
separation
and
the
sheep
shall
be
separated
from
the
goats
the
other
preachers
have
the
sheep
i
have
the
goats
and
i
have
a
few
sheep
among
my
goats
but
they
are
very
ragged
this
exordium
produced
great
laughter
when
she
became
wearied
with
talking
she
began
to
cast
about
her
to
contrive
some
way
to
induce
them
to
disperse
while
she
paused
they
loudly
clamored
for
more
she
motioned
them
to
be
quiet
and
called
out
to
them
i
have
talked
and
sung
to
you
as
you
asked
me
and
now
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
will
you
grant
it
yes
yes
resounded
from
every
quarter
it
is
this
she
answered
i
will
sing
one
more
hymn
for
you
will
you
then
go
away
and
leave
us
this
night
in
peace
yes
came
faintly
feebly
from
a
few
repeat
it
says
sojourner
i
want
an
answer
from
you
all
as
of
one
accord
if
i
will
sing
you
one
more
will
you
go
away
and
leave
us
this
night
in
peace
yes
yes
shouted
many
voices
with
hearty
emphasis
repeat
my
request
once
more
said
she
i
want
you
all
to
answer
and
she
reiterated
the
words
again
this
time
a
long
loud
came
up
as
from
the
multitudinous
mouth
of
the
entire
mob
it
is
sealed
repeated
sojourner
in
the
deepest
and
most
solemn
tones
of
her
powerful
and
sonorous
voice
its
effect
ran
through
the
multitude
like
an
electric
shock
and
the
most
of
them
considered
themselves
bound
by
their
promise
as
they
might
have
failed
to
do
under
less
imposing
circumstances
some
of
them
began
instantly
to
leave
others
said
we
not
to
have
one
more
hymn
answered
their
entertainer
and
she
commenced
to
sing
bless
the
lord
i
got
my
and
to
slay
goliath
in
the
and
the
good
old
way
is
a
righteous
way
i
mean
to
take
the
kingdom
in
the
good
old
way
while
singing
she
heard
some
enforcing
obedience
to
their
promise
while
a
few
seemed
refusing
to
abide
by
it
but
before
she
had
quite
concluded
she
saw
them
turn
from
her
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
they
were
running
as
fast
as
they
well
could
in
a
solid
body
and
she
says
she
can
compare
them
to
nothing
but
a
swarm
of
bees
so
dense
was
their
phalanx
so
straight
their
course
so
hurried
their
march
as
they
passed
with
a
rush
very
near
the
stand
of
the
other
preachers
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
smitten
with
fear
thinking
that
their
entertainer
had
failed
to
enchain
them
longer
with
her
spell
and
that
they
were
coming
upon
them
with
redoubled
and
remorseless
fury
but
they
found
they
were
mistaken
and
that
their
fears
were
groundless
for
before
they
could
well
recover
from
their
surprise
every
rioter
was
gone
and
not
one
was
left
on
the
grounds
or
seen
there
again
during
the
meeting
sojourner
was
informed
that
as
her
audience
reached
the
main
road
some
distance
from
the
tents
a
few
of
the
rebellious
spirits
refused
to
go
on
and
proposed
returning
but
their
leaders
said
have
promised
to
promised
and
we
must
go
all
go
and
you
shall
none
of
you
return
again
she
did
not
fall
in
love
at
first
sight
with
the
northampton
association
for
she
arrived
there
at
a
time
when
appearances
did
not
correspond
with
the
ideas
of
associationists
as
they
had
been
spread
out
in
their
writings
for
their
phalanx
was
a
factory
and
they
were
wanting
in
means
to
carry
out
their
ideas
of
beauty
and
elegance
as
they
would
have
done
in
different
circumstances
but
she
thought
she
would
make
an
effort
to
tarry
with
them
one
night
though
that
seemed
to
her
no
desirable
affair
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
accomplished
literary
and
refined
persons
were
living
in
that
plain
and
simple
manner
and
submitting
to
the
labors
and
privations
incident
to
such
an
infant
institution
she
said
if
these
can
live
here
i
can
afterwards
she
gradually
became
pleased
with
and
attached
to
the
place
and
the
people
as
well
she
might
for
it
must
have
been
no
small
thing
to
have
found
a
home
in
a
composed
of
some
of
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
age
where
all
was
characterized
by
an
equality
of
feeling
a
liberty
of
thought
and
speech
and
a
largeness
of
soul
she
could
not
have
before
met
with
to
the
same
extent
in
any
of
her
wanderings
our
first
knowledge
of
her
was
derived
from
a
friend
who
had
resided
for
a
time
in
the
and
who
after
describing
her
and
singing
one
of
her
hymns
wished
that
we
might
see
her
but
we
little
thought
at
that
time
that
we
should
ever
pen
these
annals
of
this
child
of
nature
when
we
first
saw
her
she
was
working
with
a
hearty
good
will
saying
she
would
not
be
induced
to
take
regular
wages
believing
as
once
before
that
now
providence
had
provided
her
with
a
fount
from
which
her
every
want
might
be
perpetually
supplied
through
her
mortal
life
in
this
she
had
calculated
too
fast
for
the
associationists
found
that
taking
every
thing
into
consideration
they
would
find
it
most
expedient
to
act
individually
and
again
the
subject
of
this
sketch
found
her
dreams
unreal
and
herself
flung
back
upon
her
own
resources
for
the
supply
of
her
needs
this
she
might
have
found
more
inconvenient
at
her
time
of
labor
exposure
and
hardship
had
made
sad
inroads
upon
her
iron
constitution
by
inducing
chronic
disease
and
premature
old
she
not
remained
under
the
shadow
of
one
who
never
wearies
in
doing
good
giving
to
the
needy
and
supplying
the
wants
of
the
destitute
she
has
now
set
her
heart
upon
having
a
little
home
of
her
own
even
at
this
late
hour
of
life
where
she
may
feel
a
greater
freedom
than
she
can
in
the
house
of
another
and
where
she
can
repose
a
little
after
her
day
of
action
has
passed
by
and
for
such
a
she
is
now
dependant
on
the
charities
of
the
benevolent
and
to
them
we
appeal
with
confidence
through
all
the
scenes
of
her
eventful
life
may
be
traced
the
energy
of
a
naturally
powerful
fearlessness
and
simplicity
of
one
untrammelled
by
education
or
conventional
of
unflinching
adherence
to
a
native
enthusiasm
which
under
different
circumstances
might
easily
have
produced
another
joan
of
arc
with
all
her
fervor
and
enthusiasm
and
speculation
her
religion
is
not
tinctured
in
the
least
with
gloom
no
doubt
no
hesitation
no
despondency
spreads
a
cloud
over
her
soul
but
all
is
bright
clear
positive
and
at
times
ecstatic
her
trust
is
in
god
and
from
him
she
looks
for
good
and
not
evil
she
feels
that
love
casteth
out
fear
having
more
than
once
found
herself
awaking
from
a
mortifying
delusion
in
the
case
of
the
kingdom
resolving
not
to
be
thus
deluded
again
she
has
set
suspicion
to
guard
the
door
of
her
heart
and
allows
it
perhaps
to
be
aroused
by
too
slight
causes
on
certain
vivid
imagination
assisting
to
magnify
the
phantoms
of
her
fears
into
gigantic
proportions
much
beyond
their
real
size
instead
of
resolutely
adhering
to
the
rule
we
all
like
best
when
it
is
to
be
applied
to
of
placing
every
thing
we
see
to
the
account
of
the
best
possible
motive
until
time
and
circumstance
prove
that
we
were
wrong
where
no
good
motive
can
be
assigned
it
may
become
our
duty
to
suspend
our
judgment
till
evidence
can
be
had
in
the
application
of
this
rule
it
is
an
undoubted
duty
to
exercise
a
commendable
prudence
by
refusing
to
repose
any
important
trust
to
the
keeping
of
persons
who
may
be
strangers
to
us
and
whose
trustworthiness
we
have
never
seen
tried
but
no
possible
good
but
incalculable
evil
may
and
does
arise
from
the
too
common
practice
of
placing
all
conduct
the
source
of
which
we
do
not
fully
understand
to
the
worst
of
intentions
how
often
is
the
gentle
timid
soul
discouraged
and
driven
perhaps
to
despondency
by
finding
its
evil
spoken
of
and
a
but
mistaken
action
loaded
with
an
evil
design
if
the
world
would
but
sedulously
set
about
reforming
itself
on
this
one
point
who
can
calculate
the
change
it
would
evil
it
would
annihilate
and
the
happiness
it
would
confer
none
but
an
eye
could
at
once
embrace
so
vast
a
result
a
result
how
desirable
and
one
that
can
be
brought
about
only
by
the
most
simple
of
every
individual
seeing
to
it
that
he
commit
not
this
sin
himself
for
why
should
we
allow
in
ourselves
the
very
fault
we
most
dislike
when
committed
against
us
shall
we
not
at
least
aim
at
consistency
had
she
possessed
less
generous
more
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
business
matters
in
general
and
had
she
failed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
others
were
like
herself
and
would
when
her
turn
came
to
need
do
as
she
had
done
and
find
it
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
she
might
have
laid
by
something
for
the
future
for
few
perhaps
have
ever
possessed
the
power
and
inclination
in
the
same
degree
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
labor
as
she
has
done
both
day
and
night
for
so
long
a
period
of
time
and
had
these
energies
been
and
the
proceeds
well
husbanded
since
she
has
been
her
own
mistress
they
would
have
given
her
an
independence
during
her
natural
life
but
her
constitutional
biases
and
her
early
training
or
rather
want
of
training
prevented
this
result
and
it
is
too
late
now
to
remedy
the
great
mistake
shall
she
then
be
left
to
want
who
will
not
answer
note
george
benson
her
last
interview
with
her
master
in
the
spring
of
sojourner
made
a
visit
to
her
eldest
daughter
diana
who
has
ever
suffered
from
ill
health
and
remained
with
dumont
isabella
humane
master
she
found
him
still
living
though
advanced
in
age
and
reduced
in
property
as
he
had
been
for
a
number
of
years
but
greatly
enlightened
on
the
subject
of
slavery
he
said
he
could
then
see
that
was
the
wickedest
thing
in
the
world
the
greatest
curse
the
earth
had
ever
it
was
then
very
clear
to
his
mind
that
it
was
so
though
while
he
was
a
slaveholder
himself
he
did
not
see
it
so
and
thought
it
was
as
right
as
holding
any
other
property
sojourner
remarked
to
him
that
it
might
be
the
same
with
those
who
are
now
slaveholders
no
replied
he
with
warmth
can
not
be
for
now
the
sin
of
slavery
is
so
clearly
written
out
and
so
much
talked
against
why
the
whole
world
cries
out
against
it
if
any
one
says
he
do
know
and
has
not
heard
he
must
i
think
be
a
liar
in
my
slaveholding
days
there
were
few
that
spoke
against
it
and
these
few
made
little
impression
on
any
one
had
it
been
as
it
is
now
think
you
i
could
have
held
slaves
no
i
should
not
have
dared
to
do
it
but
should
have
emancipated
every
one
of
them
now
it
is
very
different
all
may
hear
if
they
will
yes
reader
if
any
one
feels
that
the
tocsin
of
alarm
or
the
trump
must
sound
a
louder
note
before
they
can
hear
it
one
would
think
they
must
be
very
hard
of
hearing
that
they
belong
to
that
class
of
whom
it
may
be
truly
said
have
stopped
their
ears
that
they
may
not
hear
she
received
a
letter
from
her
daughter
diana
dated
hyde
park
december
which
informed
her
that
dumont
had
west
with
some
of
his
he
had
taken
along
with
him
probably
through
mistake
the
few
articles
of
furniture
she
had
left
with
him
mind
says
sojourner
we
give
to
the
poor
we
lend
to
the
lord
she
thanked
the
lord
with
fervor
that
she
had
lived
to
hear
her
master
say
such
blessed
things
she
recalled
the
lectures
he
used
to
give
his
slaves
on
speaking
the
truth
and
being
honest
and
laughing
she
says
he
taught
us
not
to
lie
and
steal
when
he
was
stealing
all
the
time
himself
and
did
not
know
it
oh
how
sweet
to
my
mind
was
this
confession
and
what
a
confession
for
a
master
to
make
to
a
slave
a
slaveholding
master
turned
to
a
brother
poor
old
man
may
the
lord
bless
him
and
all
partake
of
his
