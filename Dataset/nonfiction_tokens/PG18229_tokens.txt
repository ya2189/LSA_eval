transactions
paper
no
the
new
york
tunnel
extension
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
by
charles
raymond
am
soc
a
some
time
before
the
appointment
of
the
board
of
engineers
which
supervised
the
designing
and
construction
of
the
new
york
tunnel
extension
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
the
late
cassatt
then
president
of
the
company
said
to
the
writer
that
for
many
years
he
had
been
unable
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
a
railroad
system
like
the
pennsylvania
should
be
prevented
from
entering
the
most
important
and
populous
city
in
the
country
by
a
river
less
than
one
mile
wide
the
result
of
this
thought
was
the
tunnel
extension
project
now
nearly
completed
but
it
is
only
in
recent
years
that
new
conditions
have
rendered
such
a
solution
of
the
problem
practicable
as
well
as
desirable
previously
a
tunnel
designed
for
steam
railroad
traffic
to
enter
new
york
city
near
christopher
street
was
partly
constructed
but
the
work
was
abandoned
for
financial
reasons
then
plans
for
a
great
suspension
bridge
to
enable
all
the
railroads
reaching
the
west
shore
of
the
north
river
to
enter
the
city
at
the
foot
of
street
were
carefully
worked
out
by
the
north
river
bridge
company
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
gave
this
project
its
support
by
agreeing
to
pay
its
share
for
the
use
of
the
bridge
but
the
other
railroads
declined
to
participate
and
the
execution
of
this
plan
was
not
undertaken
new
operating
conditions
resulting
from
the
application
of
electric
traction
to
the
movement
of
heavy
railroad
trains
which
had
been
used
initially
in
tunnels
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
was
subsequently
studied
and
adopted
by
railroads
in
europe
made
it
possible
to
avoid
the
difficulty
of
ventilation
connected
with
steam
traction
in
tunnels
and
permitted
the
use
of
grades
practically
prohibitive
with
the
steam
locomotive
the
practicability
of
the
tunnel
extension
project
finally
adopted
was
thus
assured
the
acquisition
of
the
control
of
the
long
island
railroad
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
which
occurred
in
introduced
new
and
important
elements
into
the
transportation
problem
from
a
freight
as
well
as
a
passenger
standpoint
previously
the
plans
considered
had
for
their
only
object
the
establishment
of
a
convenient
terminus
in
new
york
to
avoid
the
delays
and
difficulties
involved
in
the
necessity
of
transporting
passengers
and
freight
across
the
north
river
when
the
long
island
railroad
became
practically
a
part
of
the
pennsylvania
system
it
was
possible
and
desirable
to
extend
the
project
so
as
to
provide
not
only
for
a
great
prospective
local
traffic
from
all
parts
of
long
island
but
also
for
through
passenger
and
freight
traffic
to
the
new
england
states
and
to
and
from
all
points
on
the
pennsylvania
system
thus
avoiding
the
long
ferriage
from
jersey
city
around
the
harbor
to
the
harlem
river
this
paper
has
for
its
subject
the
new
york
tunnel
extension
project
and
is
intended
merely
as
an
introduction
to
the
detailed
accounts
of
the
construction
of
the
various
divisions
of
the
line
to
be
given
in
succeeding
papers
prepared
by
the
engineers
who
actively
carried
out
the
work
the
project
however
forms
the
most
important
part
of
the
comprehensive
scheme
adopted
by
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
for
conducting
its
traffic
into
and
through
new
york
city
and
a
brief
description
of
this
general
plan
is
therefore
necessary
in
order
that
the
relations
of
the
tunnel
line
to
the
other
parts
of
the
transportation
project
may
be
clearly
understood

of
the
general
plan
outlined
by
the
late

to
the
board
of

commissioners
of

terminal
railroad
generally
referred
to
as
the
new
york
tunnel
extension
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
this
line
begins
near

city
the
parts
sustained
by
these
elements
in
the
work
of
transportation
and
distribution
are
briefly
as
follows
the
new
york
tunnel
extension
is
essentially
a
passenger
line
although
the
company
has
not
only
the
legal
powers
but
also
the
facilities
for
making
it
a
through
route
for
freight
if
desired
it
will
transport
passengers
to
and
from
the
centrally
located
station
at
street
and
seventh
avenue
in
new
york
city
joining
the
long
island
system
at
sunnyside
yard
and
by
means
of
the
new
york
connecting
railroad
it
will
form
a
link
in
the
through
traffic
line
connecting
the
whole
pennsylvania
system
with
the
new
england
states
this
line
has
been
designed
for
the
safe
and
expeditious
handling
of
a
large
volume
of
traffic
the
requirements
include
handling
the
heaviest
through
express
trains
south
and
west
from
the
main
line
as
well
as
the
frequent
and
lighter
trains
for
through
service
the
locomotive
principle
of
operation
has
been
adhered
to
that
is
electric
locomotives
will
take
up
the
work
of
the
steam
locomotives
at
the
interchange
yard
at
harrison
and
for
excursion
and
suburban
service
to
nearby
towns
provision
will
be
made
for
electric
locomotives
or
by
operation
of
special
motor
cars
in
trains
the
project
being
planned
to
give
the
greatest
flexibility
in
method
of
operation
to
meet
the
growing
demand
in
the
best
way
the
new
york
connecting
railroad
has
important
functions
both
for
freight
and
passenger
service
when
constructed
it
will
be
about
miles
long
and
will
form
a
part
of
the
line
to
the
new
england
states
for
through
passenger
and
freight
service
and
also
carry
local
freight
to
and
from
sunnyside
yard
and
brooklyn
and
all
points
on
long
island
by
means
of
this
line
it
will
be
possible
to
make
the
brooklyn
station
at
flatbush
avenue
a
station
on
the
through
system
for
new

as
well
as

the
initial
equipment
of
the
western
division
of
the
long
island
railroad
for
electric
traction
has
been
made
in
advance
of
the
opening
of
the
tunnel
line
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
requirements
of
the
atlantic
avenue
improvement
this
improvement
involved
the
elimination
of
grade
crossings
within
the
city
of
brooklyn
and
the
conversion
of
the
railroad
line
which
was
previously
on
the
surface
of
the
streets
to
part
subway
and
part
elevated
line
from
the
flatbush
avenue
terminal
to
east
new
york
station
a
distance
of
miles
one
of
the
requirements
of
this
improvement
was
that
the
motive
power
should
be
changed
to
some
form
of
power
not
involving
combustion
this
led
to
the
adoption
of
electricity
and
in
order
to
meet
operating
necessities
involved
the
electrification
of
connecting
lines
beyond
the
improvement
proper
so
that
local
service
could
be
handled
to
the
end
of
the
runs
without
changing
the
motive
power
the
extent
of
the
electrification
thus
required
was
found
to
be
about
miles
this
extensive
electrification
work
was
undertaken
and
completed
in
the
summer
of
upon
the
completion
of
the
atlantic
avenue
improvement
proper
and
since
that
time
has
been
in
successful
operation
on
the
near
approach
of
the
construction
of
the
new
york
terminal
improvement
plans
for
additional
electrification
on
the
long
island
railroad
were
made
and
the
work
is
now
in
progress
on
the
extensive
additions
required
to
couple
up
the
tunnel
extension
with
the
various
lines
centering
at
the
long
island
city
terminus
the
bay
ridge
improvement
of
the
long
island
railroad
comprises
the
readjustment
of
the
right
of
way
and
the
establishment
of
new
grades
in
order
to
do
away
with
grade
crossings
from
the
freight
terminal
at
bay
ridge
to
a
junction
with
the
new
york
connecting
railroad
at
east
new
york
a
distance
of
miles
it
also
provides
for
the
of
the
line
and
the
elimination
of
grade
crossings
on
the
branch
running
to
manhattan
beach
a
distance
of
miles
the
work
is
being
executed
without
interrupting
traffic
and
in
all
about
grade
crossings
will
be
abolished
this
improvement
became
necessary
in
order
to
provide
for
the
rapid
extension
of
population
into
the
suburban
districts
and
for
the
present
and
future
requirements
of
the
section
to
establish
municipal
conveniences
and
facilities
and
to
open
additional
streets
across
the
right
of
way
to
accomplish
these
ends
the
line
has
been
built
in
cuts
and
on
embankments
there
being
about
miles
of
the
former
miles
of
the
latter
and
a
tunnel
long
where
the
line
crosses
the
atlantic
avenue
improvement
the
atlantic
avenue
improvement
as
mentioned
above
involved
the
removal
of
the
railroad
tracks
from
the
street
surface
for
a
distance
of
about
miles
this
was
done
by
constructing
a
series
of
elevated
and
subway
structures
there
being
about
miles
of
the
former
miles
of
the
latter
and
mile
of
approaches
eliminating
more
than
grade
crossings
in
the
light
of
recent
developments
it
may
be
of
interest
to
note
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
establishing
a
combination
elevated
and
subway
line
was
that
at
the
time
the
improvement
was
projected
no
underground
railroad
in
the
country
of
similar
length
and
carrying
a
heavy
volume
of
local
traffic
was
operated
by
electricity
and
public
sentiment
was
against
the
operation
of
the
entire
length
of
the
line
underground
by
steam
power
this
improvement
also
provided
for
depressing
the
entire
flatbush
avenue
station
and
a
freight
yard
as
the
work
progressed
the
original
plans
for
the
station
were
greatly
enlarged
the
remodeled
station
covering
about
city
lots
the
main
point
of
passenger
distribution
is
the
new
york
station
other
important
stations
will
be
flatbush
avenue
brooklyn
jamaica
long
island
where
the
changes
to
and
from
electric
motive
power
will
be
made
and
newark
j
many
other
places
including
the
seaside
resorts
on
long
island
and
in
new
jersey
will
feel
the
benefits
of
the
direct
tunnel
railroad
into
and
through
new
york
city
the
glendale
will
materially
shorten
the
route
and
running
time
from
new
york
through
the
tunnels
to
rockaway
beach
the
plans
contemplate
that
passengers
to
and
from
the
lower
part
of
manhattan
will
be
carried
by
the
steam
line
between
newark
and
jersey
city
and
cross
the
north
river
by
ferry
or
the
cortlandt
street
tunnels
of
the
hudson
company
eventually
the
old
main
line
will
be
electrified
and
supersede
the
steam
service
between
newark
and
jersey
city
the
greenville
yard
is
the
most
important
point
for
the
receipt
transmission
and
distribution
of
freight
from
this
point
freight
can
be
transported
without
breaking
bulk
by
a
comparatively
short
to
the
long
island
railroad
terminus
at
bay
ridge
and
thus
a
very
large
part
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
floatage
in
new
york
harbor
and
the
east
river
will
be
abolished
the
floatage
distance
being
reduced
in
the
case
of
the
new
england
freight
from
about
to
miles
this
traffic
will
be
routed
from
bay
ridge
the
long
island
railroad
to
a
connection
with
and
thence
over
the
new
york
connecting
railroad
to
the
new
york
new
haven
and
hartford
railroad
at
port
morris
y
as
the
facilities
for
the
handling
of
freight
in
the
boroughs
of
brooklyn
and
queens
had
become
insufficient
for
taking
care
of
the
prospective
traffic
eleven
new
local
delivery
yards
having
a
combined
area
of
about
city
lots
have
been
established
and
three
existing
yards
are
to
be
improved
and
enlarged
so
as
to
give
a
combined
area
of
about
city
lots
of
these
new
yards
the
bay
ridge
freight
terminal
containing
about
city
lots
is
the
largest
its
functions
have
been
described
above
there
is
a
freight
terminal
at
east
new
york
wide
and
a
mile
long
containing
about
city
lots
which
will
be
the
distributing
point
of
freight
for
the
entire
east
new
york
section
this
yard
is
depressed
and
will
be
crossed
by
six
viaducts
carrying
city
streets
the
north
shore
freight
yard
containing
city
lots
is
connected
with
the
montauk
division
by
an
overhead
construction
known
as
the
montauk
freight
whereby
all
freight
traffic
to
jamaica
may
be
kept
out
of
the
way
of
the
jamaica
passenger
traffic
from
the
tunnels
it
may
be
of
interest
to
indicate
briefly
how
much
has
already
been
accomplished
in
the
execution
of
this
general
plan
and
what
still
remains
to
be
done
for
its
completion
the
larger
part
of
the
electrification
of
the
long

railroad
and
the
elimination
of

within
the
city

it
is
therefore
impossible
at

it
is
not
necessary
for

to
say
that
in
view
of
the
magnitude
and
great
cost
of
the
proposed
construction
and
of
the
novel
engineering
questions
involved
your
studies
should
be
thorough
and
exhaustive
and
should
be
based
upon
absolute
knowledge
of
the
conditions
the
board
was
organized
on
january
when
it
held
its
first
session
and
continued
in
the
performance
of
its
duties
until
april
when
it
was
dissolved
its
work
having
been
completed
the
board
held
regular
and
special
sessions
to
receive
progress
reports
from
the
chief
engineers
in
direct
charge
of
construction
and
to
consider
questions
relating
to
the
plans
and
details
of
the
work
submitted
by
its
members
or
referred
to
it
by
the
management
it
then
reported
its
conclusions
to
the
for
approval
before
the
work
was
undertaken
the
management
earnestly
impressed
upon
the
board
throughout
the
whole
period
of
its
labors
that
the
tunnel
extension
and
facilities
were
to
be
designed
and
constructed
without
regarding
cost
as
a
governing
factor
the
main
considerations
being
safety
durability
and
proper
accommodation
of
the
traffic
no
expenditure
tending
to
insure
these
conditions
was
to
be
avoided

general
considerations
details
have
been
omitted
from
the
foregoing
description
as
they
can
be
treated
better
and
more
fully
by
the
constructing
engineers
in
succeeding
papers
there
are
however
some
general
considerations
involved
in
the
designing
of
the
work
which
may
perhaps
be
referred
to
more
conveniently
in
this
introductory
paper
and
these
will
now
receive
attention
in
all
parts
of
the
work
problems
were
encountered
requiring
for
their
solution
large
expenditures
and
much
engineering
skill
but
many
of
these
difficulties
had
been
frequently
met
in
previous
engineering
experience
and
the
methods
of
overcoming
them
were
well
understood
thus
in
the
meadows
division
a
long
and
heavy
embankment
part
of
which
was
on
submerged
meadow
land
and
many
bridge
foundations
had
to
be
constructed
in
the
bergen
hill
tunnels
very
tough
trap
rock
was
encountered
in
the
tunnels
under
the
city
the
work
was
much
complicated
and
its
cost
increased
greatly
by
the
necessity
of
caring
for
sewers
water
and
gas
pipes
and
the
foundations
of
adjacent
buildings
and
many
troublesome
problems
were
met
in
the
construction
of
the
tunnels
connecting
the
east
river
tunnels
with
the
sunnyside
yard
the
novel
features
of
the
project
however
were
the
great
tunnels
extending
the
line
under
the
north
and
east
rivers
tunnels
of
the
kind
contemplated
to
be
used
for
heavy
and
rapid
railroad
traffic
had
never
been
constructed
through
materials
similar
to
those
forming
the
beds
of
the
north
and
east
rivers
questions
arising
in
connection
with
the
design
and
method
of
construction
of
the
tunnels
will
be
considered
later
here
they
are
referred
to
only
in
their
relation
to
the
location
and
grades
of
the
line
in
which
connection
the
conditions
controlling
their
establishment
were
the
most
important
elements
and
it
was
desirable
to
make
the
tunnels
between
the
bulkhead
lines
of
the
rivers
as
straight
as
possible
and
it
was
necessary
to
place
them
at
sufficient
depth
below
the
dredging
plane
of
the
war
department
which
in
the
north
and
east
rivers
is
and
below
mean
low
water
respectively
to
insure
them
against
possible
injury
from
heavy
anchors
or
sunken
vessels
furthermore
they
had
to
pass
under
the
piers
and
bulkheads
of
manhattan
at
a
depth
sufficient
to
make
it
certain
that
they
would
not
affect
the
stability
of
those
structures
another
consideration
influencing
the
establishment
of
the
depth
of
the
tunnels
below
the
bottoms
of
the
rivers
became
important
as
soon
as
the
method
of
construction
by
shields
with
compressed
air
was
adopted
namely
the
necessity
of
providing
sufficient
cover
to
guard
as
far
as
possible
against
during
construction
the
tunnels
under
the
city
connecting
the
tunnels
with
the
terminal
station
were
located
so
as
to
give
as
favorable
grades
as
possible
the
provision
of
the
franchise
requiring
the
tops
of
the
tunnels
to
be
at
least
below
the
street
surface
which
had
been
suggested
by
the
company
to
permit
of
future
subways
had
no
effect
on
their
location
as
other
conditions
required
them
to
be
at
a
greater
depth
the
line
extending
westward
from
bergen
hill
had
to
be
established
so
as
to
give
ample
at
the
numerous
bridges
over
the
railroads
and
highways
which
it
crosses
eastward
from
the
east
river
tunnels
the
grades
were
established
so
as
to
rise
as
uniformly
as
possible
to
the
level
of
the
sunnyside
yard
the
general
features
of
the
line
as
finally
adopted
and
constructed
are
as
follows
the
maximum
grade
west
of
the
terminal
station
occurs
on
the
new
york
side
of
the
north
river
and
is
in
the
and
in
the
tunnels
the
ruling
grades
for
the
ascending
traffic
being
in
the
and
in
the
tunnels
in
the
tunnels
east
of
the
terminal
station
the
ruling
grade
is
for
both
and
traffic
there
is
however
descending
with
the
traffic
a
short
section
on
a
grade
of
per
cent
these
grades
would
be
objectionable
with
steam
locomotives
under
a
heavy
traffic
but
the
development
of
the
electric
locomotive
has
rendered
possible
the
operation
of
grades
which
would
have
formerly
been
considered
prohibitive
from
the
junction
with
the
pennsylvania
railroad
near
harrison
to
woodside
long
island
a
distance
of
miles
there
is
an
average
of
curves
per
mile
the
line
having
a
total
curvature
of
degrees
the
maximum
curvature
is
degrees

division
sunnyside
yard
of
construction
of
the
character
of
the
material
through
which
the
tunnels
were
to
be
constructed
differed
greatly
in
the
two
rivers
the
bed
of
the
north
river
at
the
level
of
the
tunnels
consists
of
silt
composed
principally
of
clay
sand
and
water
while
that
of
the
east
river
is
formed
of
a
great
variety
of
materials
such
as
quicksand
sand
boulders
gravel
clay
and
when
the
method
of
construction
had
to
be
decided
there
were
no
thoroughly
satisfactory
precedents
to
follow
in
the
case
of
either
river
although
the
gas
tunnel
under
the
east
river
the
partly
constructed
hudson
tunnels
under
the
north
river
the
clair
tunnel
under
the
clair
river
the
blackwall
and
several
other
tunnels
under
the
thames
river
at
london
supplied
much
useful
information
the
smaller
tunnels
for
a
lighter
traffic
since
so
successfully
constructed
under
the
north
and
east
rivers
had
not
then
been
completed
under
these
circumstances
it
was
the
desire
of
the
management
that
the
board
should
receive
and
consider
proposed
methods
of
construction
from
all
available
sources
and
during
the
first
year
of
its
labors
much
of
its
time
was
devoted
to
the
examination
and
discussion
of
projects
submitted
for
its
consideration
by
engineers
and
practical
builders
some
of
these
projects
having
decided
merit
most
of
the
methods
proposed
involved
temporary
structures
or
the
use
of
floating
plant
in
the
navigable
channels
of
the
river
this
was
objectionable
in
view
of
the
resulting
obstruction
to
the
enormous
river
traffic
after
full
consideration
of
the
subject
it
was
decided
to
adopt
the
shield
method
with
compressed
air
for
the
construction
of
the
tunnels
under
both
rivers
this
being
the
only
method
recommended
by
the
chief
engineers
and
having
the
great
advantage
of
conducting
all
operations
below
the
bottom
of
the
river
thus
avoiding
obstruction
of
the
channel
experience
has
shown
as
was
anticipated
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
construct
tunnels
in
such
material
as
occurs
in
the
east
river
and
on
the
new
jersey
side
of
the
north
river
than
in
more
homogeneous
material
such
as
is
found
in
the
greater
part
of
the
north
river
during
the
progress
of
construction
under
the
east
river
there
were
frequent
through
fissures
opened
in
the
and
the
bottom
of
the
river
over
the
tunnel
had
to
be
blanketed
continuously
with
clay
to
check
the
flow
of
the
escaping
air
in
view
of
the
serious
difficulties
which
it
was
thought
might
be
encountered
in
the
application
of
the
shield
method
to
the
east
river
work
other
methods
for
the
execution
of
this
part
of
the
project
received
special
consideration
one
of
the
methods
considered
being
the
freezing
process
it
was
proposed
to
drive
a
small
pilot
tunnel
and
freeze
the
ground
for
a
sufficient
distance
around
it
by
circulating
brine
through
a
system
of
pipes
established
in
the
tunnel
the
pilot
tunnel
was
then
to
be
removed
and
the
tunnel
was
to
be
excavated
in
the
frozen
material
and
its
lining
placed
in
position
by
this
means
it
was
intended
to
avoid
the
danger
incident
to
the
use
of
compressed
air
in
material
of
greatly
varying
character
this
method
contained
too
many
elements
of
uncertainty
to
justify
its
adoption
but
as
the
management
considered
it
desirable
to
have
if
possible
an
alternative
method
an
extended
experiment
was
made
with
the
freezing
process
a
pilot
tunnel
in
in
diameter
was
driven
in
the
bed
of
the
east
river
for
a
distance
of
circulating
pipes
were
established
in
it
and
brine
at
a
very
low
temperature
was
passed
through
the
pipes
until
the
ground
was
frozen
for
a
distance
of
about
around
the
tunnel
observations
to
determine
the
rate
of
cooling
and
other
important
points
connected
with
the
process
were
carefully
made
when
it
was
found
that
the
construction
of
the
tunnels
was
progressing
satisfactorily
by
the
shield
method
and
that
so
much
time
was
required
to
freeze
the
material
that
the
freezing
process
could
not
be
used
to
advantage
in
this
particular
case
the
experiment
was
discontinued
of
the
the
tunnels
consist
of
a
circular
shell
of
the
segmental
bolted
type
having
an
outside
diameter
of
lined
with
concrete
having
a
normal
thickness
of
from
the
outside
of
the
shell
through
each
plate
of
the
shell
there
is
a
small
hole
closed
with
a
screw
plug
through
which
grout
may
be
forced
into
the
surrounding
material
each
tunnel
contains
a
single
track
a
concrete
bench
the
upper
surface
of
which
is
below
the
axis
of
the
tunnel
is
placed
on
each
side
of
the
track
the
distance
between
benches
being
in
these
benches
contain
ducts
for
carrying
electric
cables
the
main
reason
for
adopting
tunnels
instead
of
a
larger
tunnel
containing
two
tracks
was
to
avoid
the
danger
of
accidents
due
to
the
obstruction
of
both
tracks
by
derailment
or
otherwise
the
tunnels
are
made
just
large
enough
to
allow
the
passage
of
a
train
with
perfect
safety
as
it
was
believed
that
with
such
an
arrangement
thorough
ventilation
would
be
secured
by
the
motion
of
the
trains
experience
seems
to
justify
this
assumption
but
in
order
to
assure
thorough
ventilation
under
unusual
conditions
such
as
the
stoppage
of
trains
in
the
tunnels
a
complete
ventilating
plant
will
be
provided
for
each
tunnel
the
rapidity
and
safety
of
construction
were
increased
by
making
the
tunnel
as
small
as
possible
one
of
the
difficulties
in
the
shield
method
of
construction
being
the
difference
in
hydrostatic
pressure
between
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
shield
which
increases
with
the
diameter
of
the
tunnel
the
concrete
lining
was
introduced
to
insure
the
permanency
of
the
structure
strengthen
it
from
outward
pressure
and
guard
it
against
injury
from
accidents
which
might
occur
in
the
tunnel
the
side
concrete
benches
were
suggested
by
cassatt
president
to
confine
the
trains
to
the
center
of
the
tunnels
in
case
of
derailment
and
to
furnish
sidewalks
on
each
side
of
the
trains
so
as
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
walking
on
the
track
refuge
niches
are
constructed
in
the
side
benches
of
the
tunnels
manholes
splicing
chambers
pump
chambers
and
other
features
for
the
handling
of
the
electric
cables
and
drainage
are
established
at
intervals
at
points
where
unusual
stresses
were
anticipated
as
for
instance
where
the
tunnels
pass
from
rock
to
soft
ground
the
shell
was
composed
of
steel
instead
of
plates
in
the
north
river
tunnels
the
concrete
lining
in
the
invert
and
in
the
arch
was
reinforced
by
longitudinal
steel
bars
but
these
were
not
introduced
in
the
east
river
tunnels
other
details
connected
with
the
structures
including
the
drainage
lighting
ventilation
signaling
and
electrification
systems
will
be
given
in
succeeding
papers
of
the
one
of
the
most
important
questions
connected
with
the
design
of
these
tunnels
was
their
probable
stability
under
the
action
of
a
heavy
and
rapid
railroad
traffic
the
tunnels
are
lighter
than
the
materials
which
they
displace
even
when
the
weight
of
the
heavy
live
load
is
included
in
the
east
river
the
character
of
the
material
seemed
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
tunnels
would
not
be
displaced
even
under
the
action
of
the
live
load
in
the
north
river
however
the
tunnels
are
enveloped
by
a
soft
silt
and
it
was
at
first
apprehended
that
some
system
of
supports
would
be
advisable
to
carry
the
heavy
traffic
and
insure
the
tunnels
against
displacement
under
its
action
to
meet
this
contingency
which
was
then
believed
to
be
a
very
serious
one
it
was
proposed
to
sink
through
the
bottom
of
each
tunnel
into
and
through
the
underlying
silt
until
satisfactory
bearing
material
was
reached
the
pile
supports
were
worked
out
in
sufficient
detail
to
be
embraced
in
the
contract
for
the
construction
of
these
tunnels
with
provision
however
for
omitting
them
should
it
be
determined
subsequently
that
their
use
was
undesirable
the
contract
plans
contained
provisions
for
sliding
joints
where
the
piles
pass
through
the
tunnel
floor
so
that
the
live
load
might
be
carried
directly
to
the
pile
heads
by
a
system
of
girders
and
also
for
attaching
the
piles
directly
to
the
tunnel
the
two
plans
being
alternatives
investigations
made
during
the
progress
of
the
work
to
determine
the
physical
character
of
the
silt
and
its
action
on
the
tunnels
suggested
the
possibility
that
the
use
of
pile
supports
might
be
inadvisable
this
view
was
confirmed
by
actual
experience
in
the
operation
of
the
tunnels
of
the
hudson
companies
between
hoboken
and
morton
street
manhattan
which
were
opened
to
traffic
in
february
the
stability
of
these
tunnels
under
traffic
gave
further
assurance
that
supports
were
unnecessary
under
the
north
river
tunnels
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
and
they
were
therefore
dispensed
with
between
the
the
bergen
hill
tunnels
the
land
portions
of
the
north
river
tunnels
and
the
tunnels
under
manhattan
are
connected
by
at
intervals
varying
from
to
as
it
was
the
desire
of
the
management
to
provide
every
arrangement
possible
to
insure
the
safety
of
its
passengers
and
employees
and
also
to
provide
for
the
convenience
of
inspection
the
question
of
establishing
between
the
tunnels
under
the
rivers
was
given
most
careful
consideration
the
conclusion
was
finally
reached
that
such
passages
as
it
was
possible
to
construct
between
these
tunnels
might
increase
instead
of
diminish
the
danger
in
case
of
accident
no
more
have
therefore
been
constructed
in
the
sections
except
in
the
east
river
where
there
is
a
and
pump
chamber
combined
between
each
pair
of
tunnels
about
from
the
manhattan
bulkhead
line
probable
results
of
the
improvements
in
preceding
pages
reference
has
been
made
to
the
general
objects
of
the
improvements
included
in
the
project
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
for
the
new
york
district
while
it
is
impossible
in
this
introductory
paper
to
analyze
fully
the
transportation
problem
at
new
york
it
seems
desirable
to
indicate
briefly
some
of
the
more
obvious
effects
which
the
improvements
may
be
expected
to
produce
upon
the
distribution
and
handling
of
traffic
new
york
city
owes
its
position
as
the
business
metropolis
of
the
country
mainly
to
its
magnificent
harbor
and
the
extensive
waterfronts
on
its
deep
wide
rivers
which
furnish
unrivaled
facilities
at
a
short
distance
from
the
sea
for
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
its
foreign
commerce
being
about
half
the
total
for
the
whole
country
the
facilities
of
the
port
and
its
tributaries
therefore
have
always
been
guarded
with
jealous
care
not
only
by
the
local
commercial
interests
but
also
by
the
general
government
during
recent
years
however
the
population
of
the
metropolitan
district
has
increased
so
enormously
that
new
york
is
now
the
greatest
terminal
passenger
and
freight
traffic
center
in
the
country
and
in
manufactures
it
ranks
first
among
american
cities
the
new
commercial
interests
thus
created
are
of
at
least
equal
importance
with
those
of
the
commerce
although
their
existence
and
development
are
largely
the
result
of
the
water
facilities
of
the
port
the
local
passenger
and
freight
traffic
of
the
pennsylvania
and
of
other
railroads
reaching
the
west
shore
of
the
north
river
is
conducted
by
and
which
deliver
their
loads
at
piers
on
the
manhattan
waterfront
and
elsewhere
in
the
harbor
these
boats
obstruct
and
endanger
the
free
navigation
of
the
channels
and
occupy
space
along
the
waterfront
greatly
needed
for
the
accommodation
of
the
commerce
especially
on
the
north
river
in
the
east
river
the
importance
of
as
a
means
of
traffic
distribution
has
already
been
greatly
reduced
by
the
construction
of
bridges
and
tunnels
which
provide
for
the
greater
part
of
the
passenger
and
vehicular
traffic
the
north
river
however
by
reason
of
its
greater
width
and
the
comparative
slowness
of
its
currents
is
by
far
the
more
important
waterway
for
the
use
of
vessels
of
the
larger
classes
in
this
river
the
conditions
for
the
construction
of
bridges
within
the
limits
of
commercial
convenience
seem
to
be
practically
prohibitory
tunnels
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
and
the
diversion
of
the
freight
traffic
from
the
inner
waters
of
the
harbor
are
apparently
the
only
available
means
of
relief
when
the
new
line
is
in
operation
a
very
large
part
of
the
new
york
passenger
traffic
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
will
be
carried
to
the
new
york
station
at
seventh
avenue
and
street
and
the
rest
will
go
to
cortlandt
street
through
the
hudson
company
tunnels
thus
a
large
portion
of
the
pennsylvania
passenger
ferry
traffic
which
amounts
to
more
than
passengers
daily
will
be
practically
eliminated
from
the
problem
in
addition
a
large
part
of
the
long
island
railroad
passengers
will
use
the
station
at
seventh
avenue
and
street
and
its
ferry
traffic
will
be
reduced
accordingly
the
new
arrangements
for
the
transfer
of
freight
from
greenville
to
bay
ridge
will
relieve
the
inner
waters
of
the
harbor
of
a
large
volume
of
obstructive
traffic
there
appears
to
be
no
reason
why
this
traffic
should
not
be
eventually
conducted
through
tunnels
under
the
outer
harbor
should
future
transportation
conditions
justify
the
enormous
cost
of
such
structures
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
while
these
new
arrangements
greatly
reduce
the
passenger
and
freight
water
transportation
they
have
no
effect
on
the
large
vehicular
traffic
across
the
north
river
which
must
continue
to
be
conducted
by
ferries
until
it
can
be
otherwise
provided
for
as
long
as
these
conditions
exist
must
be
used
in
large
numbers
and
continue
to
obstruct
the
north
river
this
difficulty
probably
can
not
be
overcome
by
the
construction
of
bridges
as
in
the
case
of
the
east
river
but
it
does
not
seem
too
much
to
expect
that
eventually
tunnels
to
provide
for
the
vehicular
traffic
like
the
blackwall
tunnel
under
the
thames
will
be
established
under
the
north
river
it
would
be
interesting
to
estimate
the
increase
in
railroad
traffic
capacity
resulting
from
these
improvements
but
the
data
required
for
this
purpose
are
not
available
some
idea
of
the
increase
in
passenger
traffic
capacity
resulting
from
the
establishment
of
the
tunnel
line
may
be
obtained
by
comparing
the
proposed
daily

the
new
station
with
the

the

has
been
greatly
enlarged
by
the
construction
of
the
greenville

and
the
facilities
connected
therewith
but
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
amount
of
this

however
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
during
the
period
from
to
the
freight
traffic
density
on
the
lines
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
increased
from
to
per
mile
of
road
a
growth
of
nearly
per
cent
doubtless
the
improved
freight
facilities
of
the
new
york
district
had
a
large
influence
in
the
development
of
this
increase
one
of
the
most
interesting
points
connected
with
this
development
of
traffic
facilities
is
its
influence
on
the
relative
distribution
of
population
in
the
different
parts
of
the
metropolitan
district
in
the
population
per
acre
of
the
different
divisions
of
greater
new

was
reported
as
follows
manhattan

the
effect
of
new
lines
connecting
some
of
these
districts
and
sections
of
new
jersey
not
far
from
the
north
river
with
the
business
center
of
the
city
will
undoubtedly
be
to
increase
greatly
their
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
the
of
manhattan
will
be
sensibly
reduced
by
these
improvements
for
they
stimulate
the
increase
of
population
and
apparently
no
increase
of
transportation
facilities
can
keep
up
with
the
growth
of
the
city
the
population
of
a
great
commercial
city
must
be
congested
near
the
business
center
this
is
a
necessary
condition
of
its
existence
all
that
can
be
done
to
meet
this
condition
is
to
provide
all
possible
facilities
for
moving
the
people
into
and
out
of
the
business
districts
and
within
its
limits
during
recent
years
the
business
population
of
the
lower
part
of
the
borough
of
manhattan
has
become
greatly
congested
very
high
buildings
providing
business
accommodations
for
large
numbers
of
people
have
been
constructed
and
these
people
must
move
to
and
from
their
working
places
at
about
the
same
times
that
is
at
the
rush
hours
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
at
the
beginning
and
ending
of
the
working
day
every
effort
has
been
made
to
provide
for
this
immense
and
rapidly
increasing
local
passenger
traffic
by
the
construction
of
surface
elevated
and
subterranean
railways
but
the
demand
for
transportation
has
increased
much
faster
than
the
facilities
can
be
provided
and
it
is
evident
that
the
limit
of
passenger
traffic
facilities
has
been
very
nearly
reached
apparently
the
only
remedy
for
these
conditions
is
the
movement
of
business
and
the
people
transacting
it
or
to
the
boroughs
of
brooklyn
and
queens
which
are
now
readily
accessible
by
tunnels
and
subways
this
movement
of
course
is
resisted
by
the
great
real
estate
and
money
interests
centered
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
but
notwithstanding
this
resistance
the
improvement
has
commenced
and
has
rapidly
advanced
the
great
retail
houses
are
being
established
above
street
the
banks
and
brokers
offices
are
rapidly
appearing
around
the
new
business
center
of
the
city
the
facilities
afforded
by
the
telephone
and
the
subway
for
communication
with
the
money
center
have
doubtless
greatly
promoted
this
movement
when
the
pennsylvania
tunnel
extension
is
in
operation
the
easiest
and
quickest
way
for
the
passenger
to
reach
the
city
from
newark
will
bring
him
into
the
pennsylvania
station
at
seventh
avenue
and
street
the
schedule
fast
time
from
newark
to
the
new
york
cortlandt
street
station
is
now
min
this
may
be
reduced
to
about
min
by
the
use
of
the
hudson
company
tunnels
and
while
this
involves
inconvenience
in
changing
transportation
at
jersey
city
yet
it
brings
the
traveler
three
blocks
nearer
broadway
the
time
from
newark
to
the
pennsylvania
station
will
be
about
and
the
trip
will
be
made
without
change
of
transportation
so
that
undoubtedly
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
pennsylvania
passenger
traffic
desiring
to
reach
the
shopping
and
hotel
center
of
the
city
will
go
to
the
new
station
the
effect
of
the
tunnel
extension
in
increasing
the
volume
and
rapidity
of
the
movement
and
the
real
estate
values
will
be
very
great
indeed
its
influence
is
already
apparent
although
the
line
is
not
yet
opened
for
traffic
with
the
extension

project
the

desires
to
pay
a
tribute
of
admiration
and
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
late
cassatt
president
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
to
whom
the
conception
design
and
execution
of
the
project
are
mainly
due
his
education
and
experience
as
a
civil
engineer
his
thorough
knowledge
of
all
the
details
of
railroad
construction
operation
and
management
gained
by
long
and
varied
service
the
directness
clearness
and
strength
of
his
mind
and
his
great
executive
ability
placed
him
at
the
head
of
the
railroad
men
of
the
country
in
the
consideration
of
great
problems
whether
of
transportation
finance
commerce
or
political
economy
he
was
almost
unequaled
owing
to
the
breadth
originality
and
decisiveness
of
his
character
yet
his
manner
to
his
subordinates
was
so
direct
and
simple
that
he
seemed
unconscious
of
his
own
superiority
great
as
it
is
the
new
york
plan
of
improvement
is
only
one
item
in
a
scheme
of
development
which
became
the
policy
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
through
advice
and
influence
yet
his
strongest
interest
was
doubtless
centered
in
the
new
york
works
it
is
the
sincere
regret
of
all
connected
with
the
design
and
execution
of
the
project
that
he
did
not
live
to
see
its
completion
