this

it

as

the

been

it
should
however
be
borne
in
mind
that
many
fabrics
are
known
in
the

by
a
variety
of
names
so
that
one
branch
of
the

may
not
recognise
a

applied
to

the

have
been
built
up
from

obtained
first

from
practical

fabrics
does
not
appear
in

modern
works
dealing

probably
approximates

in
width
and
from

in
length

from

from

that
they
are

these
have
some

at
the
width
it

the

operation
of

consists
of
running

plain

cloth
is
an
fabric
plain
woven
from
cotton
yarns
and
is
free
from
any
woven
or

ornamentation
the
nature
of
the

is
such
that
it
readily
shrinks
or
curls
in
length
when
not
kept
at
a
high
tension
this
together
with
subsequent
finishing
operations
causes
a
considerable
contraction
to
take
place
resulting
in
an
uneven
crinkled
surface
which
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
crape
the
crinkled
surface
in

crape
is
obtained
in
several
ways
by
combination
of
materials
by

combination
by
combination
of
and
by

arrangements
during

by
subjecting

specially
constructed
to

process
during

the
cheaper
grades
of
crape
have
the
crinkled
effect
produced
by
suitably
prepared
rollers
through
which
the
cloth
is
passed
and
the
crinkled
effect
in
cotton
crapes
is
not
always
the
result
of
true
crape
weaving
which
relies
on
the
irregularity
of
the
interweaving
of
threads
to
produce
the
crape
effect
in

crape
seldom
exceeds
inches

de
a
sheer
silk
having
a
minute
crape
effect
in
the
weave
the
name
in
its
correct
acceptance
applies
to
an
fabric
but
there
are
also
cotton
and
silk
mixed
fabrics
which
bear
this
name
and
at
times
even
fabrics
have
been
so
designated
by
the
retailer
at
least
all
the
materials
which
are
known
by
this
name
are
of
comparatively
light
weight
in
practically
all
these
fabrics
the
lustre
is
imparted
by
the
warp
yarns
which
are
likely
to
be
of
better
silk
than
the
filling
the
filling
yarns
are
twisted
harder
than
for
ordinary
cloth
the
hard
twisting
of
any
yarn
will
so
curl
up
the
fibres
that
they
will
not
lie
parallel
and
so
will
not
reflect
light
and
give
lustre
crêpe

fabrics
have
a
width
of
about
inches
whilst
and
cotton
and
silk
mixtures
average
inches
in
width
the
variety
is
most
often
simply
designated
as
crêpe
a
lustrous
silk
crêpe
a
fabric
of
a
warp
rib
character
in
which
the
regular
order
of
the
weave
is
so
broken
as
to
give
a
rib
crape
effect
a
dress
fabric
of
silk
or
wool
in
which
the
design
is
produced
by
using
yarns
having
a
different
degree
of
stretch
so
that
portions
of
the
fabric
are
crisped
crinkled
or
apparently
blistered
either
irregularly
or
in
set
designs
this
fabric
is
essentially
a
printed
cotton
fabric
woven
either
with
a
plain
twill
satin
or
oatmeal
weave
the
weft
is
generally
made
from
waste
and
is
not
very
regular
cretonnes
being
used
mainly
for
curtains
hangings
or
furniture
coverings
are
generally
printed
with
large
bold
and
highly
coloured
designs
it
is
woven
with
a
bleached
or
grey
cotton
warp
and
filling
in
widths
ranging
from
to
inches
and
for
curtains
in
widths
up
to
inches
their
main
feature
is
their
large
floral
designs
and
their
value
depends
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
artistic
merits
of
these
designs
sometimes
a
fancy
weave
or
small
brocaded
effect
may
occur
in
this
class
of
fabric
but
it
is
seldom
met
with
and
it
is
not
representative
of
the
true
cretonne
fabric
flax
also
is
said
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
certain
grades
of
cretonnes
without
however
taking
them
out
of
the
class
to
which
cretonne
fabrics
belong
cloth
plain
or
crimps
are
fabrics
which
have
as
their
distinctive
feature
cockled
striped
effects
these
crimped
or
cockled
stripes
are
produced
by
dividing
the
warp
threads
into
two
separate
beams
one
of
which
is
under
greater
tension
than
the
other
that
is
to
say
the
warp
threads
from
one
of
the
beams
will
be
tight
and
the
others
slack
these
slack
threads
in
the
process
of
weaving
are
taken
up
more
rapidly
and
form
the
crimped
stripes
crimps
may
also
be
produced
by
subjecting
fabrics
specially
constructed
to
a
special
chemical
process
during
finishing
or
by
passing
the
material
through
suitable
rollers
which
will
stretch
the
material
in
some
places
more
than
in
others
and
thus
artificially
produce
the
cockled
stripe
crimps
are
made
up
in
widths
seldom
exceeding
inches
the
length
of
pieces
however
may
vary
considerably
it
is
also
known
as
seersucker
or
crinkle
or
names
given
to
striped
fabrics
of
the
crimp
type
seersucker
originally
meant
a
silk
fabric
goods
may
be
described
as
fabrics
woven
with
black
or
coloured
cotton
warps
and
wool
or
worsted
fillings
and
afterwards
dyed
in
the
piece
this
process
is
resorted
to
because
the
warp
and
filling
of
a
fabric
woven
with
a
cotton
warp
and
a
wool
filling
and
then
would
not
become
identical
in
colour
as
cotton
and
wool
have
not
the
same
attraction

generally
used
in
mohair

in
this
classification
are

the
name
damask
is
technically
applied
to
certain
classes
of
fabrics
richly
decorated
with
figures
of
foliage
fruits
scrolls
and
other
ornamental
patterns
usually
of
a
large
and
elaborate
character
the
weaves
usually
employed
are
twills
mostly
satin
twills
and
the
figures
in
the
fabric
are
made
by
alternately
exchanging
warp
for
weft
surface
or
the
materials
employed
vary
according
to
the
purpose
to
which
the
fabrics
are
to
be
applied
in
the
manufacture
of
upholstery
cloth
for
hangings
and
furniture

in
the
cheapest
grades
when
cotton
is
the
material
used
damask
was
originally
applied
only
to
silken
fabrics
whose
designs
were
very
elaborately
woven
in
colours
and
often
with
either
gold
or
silver
threads
although
in
the
majority
of
damask
fabrics
nothing
but
satin
twill
weaves
are
employed
principally
five
and
eight
shaft
very
good
effects
are
obtained
by
combining
other
weaves
with
satin
twills
where
damasks
are
made
all
of
one
colour
as
in
white
linen
table
covers
the
effect
is
given
by
the
threads
lying
at
right
angles
to
each
other
the
light
falling
upon
them
brings
the
pattern
in
bold
relief

makes
it
easily
visible
applied
to
fabrics
having
a
rich
woven
design
similar
to
damask
a
term
applied
to
materials
made
of
wool
the
term
probably
originated
in
france
and
was
applied
there
to
all
fabrics
of
light
weight
made
of
wool
as
used
at
present
the
term
may
be
combined
with
another
name
and
then
purely
designates
the
nature
of
the
material
used
in
the
manufacture
of
the
fabric
such
as
in
muslin
delaine
a
stout
cotton
twill
cloth
generally
woven
as
a
twill
the
warp
is
dyed
either
blue
or
brown
before
weaving
whilst
the
weft
is
grey
they
are
both
of
coarse
counts
denim
being
a
material
has
the
warp
on
the
surface
and
as
the
warp
is
made
of
coloured
yarns
the
cloth
when
woven
shows
a
solid
coloured
surface
the
back
of
the
fabric
shows
the
bulk
of
the
weft
threads
and
these
being
in
the
grey
give
the
back
of
the
cloth
a
distinctive
lighter
colour
than
the
face
of
the
cloth
like
all
twill
weave
the
back
of
the
cloth
shows
a
effect
denims
have
generally
a
white
edging
forming
the
selvedge
they
range
from
medium
to
heavy
weight
and
are
largely
used
in
the
manufacture
of
workmen
overalls
applied
to
hosiery
having
six
ribs
on
the
face
alternating
with
three
on
the
back
this
name
is
applied
to
plain
or
figured
twills
of
bold
character
and
originates
in
the
twill
effect
which
in
relation
to
the
length
of
the
fabric
runs
in
a
diagonal
direction
this
twill
effect
is
produced
by
raising
warp
threads
in
groups
in
a
progressive
order
the
filling
thus
making
them
stand
out
in
ridges
or
heavy
twill
this
term
as
applied
to
fabrics
is
used
to
describe
two
distinct
styles
the
first
of
which
consists
of
a
small
diamond
weave
while
the
second
and
true
diaper
has
rectangular
figures
or
dice
interwoven
on
the
damask
principle
in
cotton
fabrics
it
is
confined
to
diced
or
diamond
reversible
patterns
on
a
small
scale
the
weave
is
produced
by
the
interchanging
of
warp
and
weft
in
linen
fabrics
also
it
is
used
to
produce
diced
diamond
and
patterns
and
also
small
reversible
damask
patterns
in
some
districts
the
names
dorneck
and
diced
are
used
instead
of
diaper
a
fine
cotton
fabric
plain
or
printed
having
a
cord
design
running
lengthways
of
the
piece
the
figures
are
often
arranged
in
alternate
stripes
and
appear
as
if
embossed
this
effect
being
due
to
the
coarse
weft
flushes
a
cheaper
kind
is
sometimes
made
by
arranging
a
reversed
woven
stripe
of
and
twill
on
a
plain
ground
texture
in
what
is
known
as
the
discharge
style
of
printing
the
cloth
is
first
impregnated
throughout
its
whole
substance
by
being
either
or
then
the
cloth
is
dried
but
the
colour
is
not
fixed
it
is
next
passed
through
the
printing
machine
and
chemicals
having
the
property
of
preventing
the
development
are
printed
on
it
either
alone
or
in

with
other
colouring
matters
the
ground
colour
is
then
developed
by
steaming
and
the
printed

white
or
coloured
is
obtained
upon
a
coloured

or
this
name
is
used
to
describe
a
type
of
loom
used
for
the
production
of
certain
classes
of
figured
fabrics
which
have
a
great
many
points
of
similarity
with
fabrics
produced
by
means
of
a
jacquard
loom
the
distinctive
feature
of
a
dobby
loom
is
the
series
of
lattices
into
which
pegs
are
inserted
which
control
the
lifting
of
heald

exactly
as
if
a

cotton
duck
a
stout
cotton
twill
cloth
woven
as
a
twill
from
warp

weft
the
only
difference
between
this
fabric
and
a
denim
is
that
in
the
latter
the
weft
is
grey
whereas
in
a
dungaree
both
the
warp
and
the
weft
have
been
dyed
prior
to
weaving
dungaree
being
a
material
has
the
warp
on
the
surface
and
as
both
warp

weft
are
dyed
yarns
the
cloth
when
woven
shows
a
solid
coloured
surface
fabrics
which
have
one
set
of
patterns
printed
on
the
face
of
the
cloth
and
another
different
pattern
or
design
printed
on
the
reverse
side
are
generally
styled
duplex
prints
they
differ
from
fabrics
which
have
been
printed
in
colour
on
one
face
but
in
such
a
manner
that
the
printed
pattern
has
soaked
through
and
shows
though
less
sharply
on
the
back
of
the
fabric
the
duplex
print
is
the
result
of
two
distinct
printing
operations
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
side
of
a
fabric
this
being
the
essential
condition
for
a
duplex
print
it
follows
that
the
two
patterns
need
not
be
different
fabrics
printed
on
one
side
only
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
design
shows
equally
or
nearly
so
on
both
sides
are
not
duplex

this
term
is
used
to
describe
the
colouring
of

to
enhance
their

appearance
there
are
five

piece
dyeing
unless
the
process
is
specially
mentioned
when
a
fabric
is
spoken
of

dyed
it
can
be
taken
that
what
is
meant
is
that
the
fabric
was
dyed
in
the
piece
after
being
taken
off
the
loom
a
dyed
fabric
is
one
which
has
been
impregnated
with
some
colouring
matter
and
this
irrespective
of
the
means
adopted
to
so
impregnate
it
whether
the
fabric
once
woven
has
been
allowed
to
remain
in

whether
it
has
been
drawn
through

a
view
to
its
absorbing
the

immaterial
where
both
sides
of
a
fabric
are
equally
coloured
and
where
a
fabric
shows
that
there
has
been
thorough
saturation
that
fabric
is
said
to
be
dyed
and
this
term
is
used
to
designate
any
fabric
which
has
been
first
impregnated
with
colouring
matter
either
by
being
or
and
which
in
addition
has
been
ornamented
by
having
certain
designs
impressed
on
the

probably
a

to
the

that

is
most
often
plain
woven
measuring
inches
by
to
yards

slightly
heavier
than

of
the

measurements
which
subsequent
to

has
been
the

its
narrower
sense

the

this

essentially
an

is
formed

in

being
presented
to
the
vision
and
not
the
sides
of

as
in
the

are
produced
by

to

raised
corrugations

lengthways
of

being
a

colour
it
differs
from

cords
only
as
regards
the
length
of

which
in
the

variety
is
shorter
the
difference
between
this
class
of

and

is
that
corduroy
has
a
dividing
line
between

whilst

flannel
is
a
material
which
in
the
better

should
be
of
a
character
when
a

it
is
sometimes
due
to

in
some
countries
as
much
as

of
cotton
is
allowed
in
an

when
a
higher

is
found
the

it
is
scribbled
or
carded
with
the

to
increase
the
strength
of
the

and
improve
its
spinning
properties
such
yarns
are
known
as
carded
unions
and
when
woven
will
produce
a

flannel
which
is
distinct
from

inasmuch
as
the

is
commonly
used
in
opposition
to

flannelette
can
be

composition
a
certain
amount
of

may
enter
unlike

which
from
its
very
name
shows
that
the
material
is
of

cotton
only
the

may
not
always
designate

counts
in

then
divide
the

the
only
difference
being
that
they

is
at
times
again
a
grey
shirting
may
be
termed
a
calico
which
in
the

has
become
a

the
difference
between
these
two
kinds
of

lies
in
the
fact
that
in
the
former

the
weaving
is
the
result
of
the

being
worked

controlled
by
hand

interval
of

in
the
case
of

is
oftener
called
the

only
has
to
attend
to
the
broken

the
weaver
controls
the

which
is
pulled
by

this
is
done
to
make
the

there
actually
exists
a

which
they
are
made
mungo
is
the
product
of
all
types
of

have
been
subjected
to
the
milling
process
shoddy
is
the
product
of
unmilled
fabrics
such
as
flannels
stockings
wraps
etc
mungo
is
usually
shorter
and
finer
in
fibre
than
shoddy
because
in
the
first
place
milled
cloths
are
nearly
always
made
from
the
shorter
kinds
of
wool
secondly
because
the
fibres
of
a
milled
cloth
are
very
difficult
to
separate
from
one
another
and
break
in
the
process
of
pulling
both
mungo
and
shoddy
are
rather
more
comprehensive
terms
than
names
for
any
special
type
of
material
both
classes
have
a
number
of
special
divisions
with
different
names

from

for

it

kinds
are
produced
by

the
distinctive
feature
of
this
weave
is
that
the
surface
consists
of
threads
standing
closely
together
like
bristles
in
a
brush
these
threads
appear
either
as
threads
sheared
off
smooth
so
as
to
form
a
uniform
or
even
surface
as
in
the
case
of
velvet
or
may
appear
in
the
form
of
loops
as
in
the
case
of
towelling
the
threads
forming
the
pile
are
fixed
to
the
back
in
a
more
or
less
firm
manner
and
are
known
as
loose
or
fast
pile
the
former
takes
the
form
of
the
letter
u
and
the
latter
of
the
letter
w
the
loose
pile
may
be
driven
out
of
the
material
by
pressure
as
there
are
not
the
same
binding
threads
holding
it
as
in
the
fast
pile
or
again
they
may
be
drawn
out
through
the
back
of
the
material
by
relatively
little
scratching
with
say
the
edge
of
a
the
fast
pile
can
not
be
so
withdrawn
as
one
of
the
warp
threads
passes
in
each
of
the
two
surface
depressions
as

an

which
is
more
often

there
would
appear
however
to
be
a
difference
between
the
two
fabrics
which
lies
only
in
the
length
of
the
pile
the
pile
of

being
if
anything
a
little
longer
than
that

it
is
generally
recognised
that

should
be
considered
as

recognised
by

is
accepted
by

the
nature
of
the

may
vary

in
the
great

they

clearly
stipulated
that
they

the

the

the
raising
or
napping
of
the
cloth
is
a
process
which
the
fabric
is
put
through
with
the
view
of
giving
it
a
soft
woolly
feel
by
passing
the
fabric
whilst

tightly
stretched
over
a

cylinder
which
has
its
surface
covered
with
small
steel
hooks

allow
of

what
is
technically
known
as
an

the
order
in

times
the

satin
at

this
is
removed
by

over
heated

which
destroy
the

are
often

when
a

is
woven
with
a

it
is
known
as
a

to
distinguish
it
from

and
the
order
in
which
this
is
done
is
irregular
the
filling
by
this
process
is
thus
placed
practically
all
on
the
face
of
the

this
style
of
weave
is
sometimes
called
a

reversing
the

bringing
practically
all

woven
from
mercerised
cotton

other
yarns
it
is
similar
to

somewhat
lighter

the
term
is
used
to
describe
the
satin
weave
which
does
not
fulfil
the
conditions
of
the
real
satin
as
regards
the
order
of
intersection
of
warp
and
weft
this
like
all
other
special
finishes
is
the
result
of
a
process
through
which
a
fabric
is
passed
with
the
view
of
rendering
its
face
more
lustrous
capable
of
better
reflecting
light
and
hence
having
a
more
silky
appearance
a
schreiner

is
given
to
a

means
of
a
specially
engraved

roller
this
roller
is
engraved
with
minute
lines
running
parallel
to

this
roller
has
been
suitably
heated
and
set
with
the
right
amount
of
pressure
the
cloth
is
run
between
it
and
a
plain
backing
roller
the
engraved
roller
which
comes
in

with

impresses
on
it
minute
lines

can
readily
be
distinguished
by

a
schreiner
finish
is
often
known
as
a

finish
when
any
two
or
more
kinds
of
fibres
have
been
thoroughly
mixed
together
prior
to
being
spun

are
said
to

the

go
towards

are
in
some
cases
made
of
a
stronger
material
than
that
used
for
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
folded
yarns
are
often
used
for
this
purpose
because
during
the
process
of
weaving
single
selvedge
yarns
are
liable
to
break
out
oftener
than
any
other
generally
on
account
of
the
pulling
action
of
the
weft

in
the
shuttle
as
it
is
picked

this
is
more
particularly
the
case

cottons
selvedges
are
that
part
of
the
fabric
by
which
it
is
held
out
in
a
stretched
position
in
many
of
the
stages
of
finishing
in
the
textile
trade
generally
it
is
often
stated
that
a

shows
a
good

are
mounted
on

frames
to

they
are

have
these
selvedges
reinforced
by

threads
selvedges
or
lists
of
a
colour
different
but
of
a
material
similar
to
that
of
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
denote
that
the
fabric
has
been
woven
of
dyed
yarns
and
that
it
has
not
been
obviously
if
the
selvedge
would
be
of
the
same
colour
as
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
distinctive
styles
of
selvedges
have
given
rise
to
special
names
of
fabrics
such
as
spanish
stripes
the
actual
quality
of
a
fabric
can
not
be
always
told
by
the
selvedge
but
other
conditions
being
equal
it
then
becomes
a
good
guide
to
quality
a
silk
selvedge
thread
or
threads
or
the
initials
of
the
manufacturer
in
silk
appearing
on
the
selvedge
of

fabric
generally
denotes
a
superior
quality
of

the
following
from
a
work
dealing
with
cotton
fabrics
shows
the
generally
accepted
value
of
selvedges
as
an
indication
of
quality
advertising
has
educated
the
retail
dealers
and
consumers
to
the
fact
that
cotton
warp
goods
with
a
white
selvedge
the
ground
being
of
colour
are
more
to
be
depended
upon
not
to
crock
than
similar
cloths
of
solid
colour
cotton
all
fabric
woven
with
a
decided
twill
and
having
a
special
finish
imitating
wool
usually
printed
with
stripes
to
imitate
woven
effects
a
fabric
of
comparatively
recent
creation
having
as
a
distinctive
feature
the
design
printed
on
the
warp
threads
the
filling
is
generally
white
but
is
sometimes
to
a
shade
approximating
the
general
tone
of
the
large
floral
decorations
which
are
generally
used
in
this
class
of
fabric
the
warp
threads
take
the
colouring
matter
in
such
a
way
that
when
woven
the
design
or
pattern
appears
equally
on
both
sides
of
the
fabric
in
somewhat
blurred
and
softened
tones
from
the
fact
that
the
fabric
is
reversible
shows
a
design
on
both
sides
it
has
sometimes
been
called
a
reversible
cretonne
but
the
true
reversible
cretonne
is
the
result
of
printing
on
a
woven
fabric
and
not
on
the
warp
threads
only
prior
to
weaving
the
blurred
effect
resembling
that
of

any
preliminary
twisting
so
that

the
number

very
rapidly

a
simple
way
of
recognising

is
by
testing
the

unravel
a
few
threads
of
the
suspected

and
place
them
in

mouth
and
masticate
them
thoroughly
artificial

softens
under
this
operation
and
breaks

linen
yarns
are
more
irregular

longitudinally
than

taken
from

this
difference
makes
the
detection
of
linen
in
a
woven
cloth
comparatively
easy
the
fibres
are
straighter
longer
and

the

the
oil
test
for
linen
is
based
upon
the
property
which
linen
has
of
more
readily
absorbing
oil
than
cotton
does
when
a
linen
and

mixture
fabric
which
has
been
freed
from
dressing
by
washing
and
boiling
is
dipped
in
oil
and
then
held
up
to
the
light
it
will
be
seen
that
the
linen
fibres
look
transparent
whereas
the
cotton
remains
more
nearly
opaque
this
is
due
to
the
linen
having
absorbed
the
oil
more
readily
than
the
cotton
all
the
cotton
contained
in

the
test
is
applied
as
follows
take
the

sample
and
free
it
from
any
dressing
or
sizing
by
soaking
it
in
water
then
after
freeing
the

from

water
place
it
in
some
of
the
prepared
solution
for
three
minutes
and
then
rinse
the
sample
in
water
should
the
cotton
tested
have
been
mercerised
it
will
appear
of
a
deep
blue
colour
on
washing
with
water
the
blue
colour
fades
very
slowly
and
needs
long
washing
whereas
ordinary
cotton
rapidly
becomes
white
on
washing
even
dyed
piece
goods
will
show
the
deep

reaction
which
is
the
result
of
the
testing
solution
acting
upon
the
caustic
soda
used
in
the
process
of
mercerisation
when
making
this
test
it
is
best
to
treat
a
known
unmercerised
cotton
at
the
same
time
as
the
suspect
sample
so
as
to
have
a
basis
for
comparison
for
if
a
silk
and
wool
mixture
or
union
fabric
is
boiled
in
strong
hydrochloric
acid
for
minutes
it
will
be
found
that
the
wool
merely
swells
whilst
the
silk
acted
upon
by
the
acid
completely
dissolves
by
careful
weighing
before
and
after
the
test
it
becomes
a
matter
of
simple
calculation
to
arrive
at
the
percentage
of
silk
present
in
the
fabric
for
if
a
fabric
suspected
of
containing
wool
and
cotton
or
other
vegetable
fibre
is
boiled
for
minutes
in
a
solution
made
by
dissolving
either
ounce
of
caustic
soda
or
caustic
potash
in
a
pint
of
water
it
will
be
found
that
all
the
wool
will
be
destroyed
and
only
the
vegetable
fibres
remain
this
test
which
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
caustic
soda
dissolves
wool
may
be
used
to
ascertain
the
percentage
of
wool
in
a
cloth
if
the
sample
tested
is
thoroughly
washed
dried
and
weighed
before
the
test
is
applied
after
testing
and
drying
the
loss
in
weight
represents
the
amount
of
wool
which
was
present
and
destroyed
during
the
test
this
test
may
be
reversed
and
the
cotton
destroyed
by
treating
the
sample
with
an
per
cent
sulphuric
acid
solution
this
however
is
a
longer
test
necessitating
the
sample
being
kept
in
the
sulphuric
acid
solution
for
about
or
hours
prior
to
drying
and
weighing
the
sample
should
be
well
washed
in
alcohol
the
principal

ticking
belongs
to
the
class

one
feature
which
is
worthy
of
mention
in

other
similar
lines
is
that
they
are
being
in
increasing
quantities
this
method
consists
of
dyeing
the

or
bleaching
it
as
the
case
may
be

the
horizontal
twill
weaving
permits
the
introduction
of
more
material
into

than
a

and
produces
therefore
a
closer

a

is
also
called
a
diagonal

the
direction
it

this
diagonal
effect

one
pick
further
from
their
respective
positions
each

a
pick
of

inserted
twill
weaves
may
be
divided
into
four
common
classes
regular
broken
fancy
figured
a
regular
twill
is
referred
to
as
a
twill
of
so
many
ends
or
shafts
by
this
is
meant
a
twill
which
contains
a
number
of
warp
and
weft
threads
which
added
together
equal
the
number
of
ends
thus
a
twill
can
either
have
four
warps
and
one
weft
three
warps
and
two
wefts
or
two
warps
and
three
wefts
this
form
of
twill
will
be
seen
to
be
a
reverse
weave
to
a
twill
effect
produces
a
twill
line
which
when
the
number
of
warp
and
weft
threads
are
equal
is
at
an
angle
of
degrees
in
a
broken
twill
effect
this
line
which
may
be
compared
to
the
stroke
of
a
letter
v
is
combined
with
another
twill
line
running
in
an
opposite
direction
and
which
is
simply
a
turning
or
reversing
of
the
threads
in
the
regular

largely
into

a
style
of

they
are
also
called

and
the
union

may
be
arrived
at
by
intermingling
the
wool

fibres
to
form
the

weft
which
is
in

and
subsequently
the

this
being
possible
as
the

the

all
authorities
do
not
agree
as
to
what
constitutes
a
union
the
following
definition
having
been
met
with
fabrics
are
union
when
composed
of
two
materials
otherwise
than
by
blending
in
the
morley
yorkshire
trade
a
union
is
a
cotton
warp
cloth
of
boiled
and
teazled
finish
superficially
resembling
broadcloth
these
yarns
as
the
name
indicates
are
the
product
of
combining
two
or
more
different
materials
into
a
yarn
generally
wool
and
cotton
or
wool
and
any
of
the
many
vegetable
fibres
capable
of
being
spun
union
yarns
may
be
produced
by
the
mixing
together
of
the
two
or
more
different
fibres
when
they
are
still
in
the
state
of
loose
fibres
in
such
a
case
the
cotton
fibres
act
as
binders
upon
the
rest
of
the
fibres
when
the
various
fibres
are
thoroughly
mixed
together
the
mixture
obtained
is
spun
this
produces
the
variety
known
as
carded
union
yarns
another
form
of
union
yarn
is
obtained
by
twisting
together
two
threads
of
different
material
some
union
yarns
have
the
appearance
of
pure
wool
threads
and
only
careful
scrutiny
will
reveal
the
presence
of
cotton
fibre
this
type
of
yarn
is
known
by
the
name
of
angola
yarn
union
yarns
being
composed
of
materials
that
are
not
affected
by
dyes
in
the
same
way
can
be
recognised
when
found
in
a
wool
fabric
from
the
fact
that
the
wool
in
the
yarn
will
have
taken
up
the
dye
whereas
the
cotton
will
not
have
done
so
to
the
same
extent
but
will
have
retained
more
or
less
its
original
colour

is
given
to
a
soft
thick
nappy
flannel
used
in
the
making
of
made
from
either
wool
or
cotton
or
a
combination
of
both
as
a
cotton
fabric
it
is
of
the
coarse
stiff
pile
variety
the
name
is
french
for
velvet
hence
its
use
in
connexion
with
a
fabric
as
a
woollen
and
worsted
term
there
is
a
considerable
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
the
precise
cloth
designated
by
the
term
velour
some
manufacturers
would
class
as
velours
any
cloth
having
a
soft
velvety
nap
others
make
finer
distinctions
classing
one
as
a
cashmere
a
second
as
a
saxony
with
velour
slightly
different
from
either
of
these
this
name
is
given
to
a
pure
pile
fabric
with
a
pile
weave
the
distinctive
feature
of
which
is
that
the
surface
consists
of
silk
threads
or
fibres
standing
closely
together
like
the
bristles
in
a
brush
these
threads
appear
as
threads
sheared
off
smooth
so
as
to
form
a
uniform
or
even
surface
in
this
definition
of
velvet
applies
to
the
pile
only
for
velvets

so
generally
woven
with
a
cotton
back
that
a
silk
velvet
should
be
considered
as
having
a
cotton
back
unless
specially
designated
as
silk

a
finish
produced
upon
woollen
fabrics
by
in
various
directions
and
subsequently
cropping

raised
level
which
leaves
the
material
with
a
fairly
dense
pile
of
a
velvety
appearance
of
silk
mixed
with
other
this
class
of
fabric
includes
all
pile
fabrics
which
in
the
first
instance
answer
to
the
description
of
velvet
have
their
pile
shorter
than
that
of
plush
and
the
pile
of
which
whilst
being
partly
of
silk
contains
other
animal
fibres
such
as
wool
or
mohair
or
even
vegetable
fibres
such
as
cotton
where
it
is
clearly
stipulated
that
they
are
velvets
of
silk

with
other
fibres
and
having
cotton

the
foundation
cloth
must
not
contain
warp
or
weft
threads

or
in
part
composed
of
any
material

this
name
is
given
to
the
class
of
fabrics
that
in
reality
are
but
cotton
velvets
like
true
velvets
they
are
woven
with
a

feature
of
which
is
that
the

these
threads
appear
as

velveteens
are
generally
woven
on
the
basis
that
is
to
say
that
the
pile
floats
or
flushings
are
produced
with
the
weft
threads
which
are
afterwards
cut
additional
to
and
on
a
firmly
constructed
woven
ground
texture
weft
pile
can
be
recognised
by
removing
from
the
fabric
a
weft
thread
when
upon
withdrawing
this
thread
it
will
be
seen
that
the
bits
of
cut
pile
are
not
looped
round
it
or
attached
to
it
but
remain
entangled
among
the
warp
threads
common
velveteen
which
is
all
cotton
will
be
identified
as
a
weft

intensified
by
calendering

sometimes
by
mercerising
the

this
differs
from

in
that
the

the
appearance
of
having
been
woven
from

a
light
cloth
largely
made
from
cotton

this
fabric
is
one
of
many
known
under
or
names
which
are
sometimes
sufficiently
popular
to
embrace
many
different
weaves
under
one
head
this

is
used
to
designate
a

generally
of
cotton
woven
with
a
square

woollen
voiles
are
also
woven
the
characteristics
being
similar
to
cotton
voile
but
in
weaving
voiles
with
worsted
yarns
if
the
yarn
is
not
very
free
from
loose
fibres
the
fabric
is
finished
by
having
its
face
singed
or
sheared
very
close
so
as
to
ensure
a
material
a
thick
weft
thread
of
low
quality
inserted
often
without
interlacing
between
the
two
fabrics
in
a
double
cloth
and
between
the
two
warps
in
a
structure
this
gives
weight
and
solidity
to
the
fabric
the
wadding
pick
remains
out
of
sight
and
the
appearance
of
the
fabric
is
not
affected
thereby
this
term
has
the
same
meaning
as
warp
welt
or
welt
and
is
used
to
describe
a
fabric
having
thick
raised
cords
at
close
intervals
warp
is
the
name
given
to
that
set
of
threads
that
runs
lengthways
of
a
piece
of
cloth
when
the
word
end
is
used
in
connexion
with
weaving
it
always
signifies
the
warp
thread
while
each
filling
or
weft
thread
is
called
a
pick
warp
pile
can
be
recognised
by
simply
withdrawing
from
the
fabric
being
examined
a
few
picks
or
weft
threads
if
the
material
is
a
weave
then
it
will
be
seen
that
the
loose
bits
of
cut
pile
remain
entangled
or
looped
and
adhering
to
some
of
the
drawn
weft
threads
this
can
be
easily
seen
if
a
common
velvet
ribbon
is
experimented
with
when
upon
drawing
out
the
weft
threads
separately
from
selvedge
to
selvedge
it
will
invariably
be
seen
that
each
alternate
weft
thread
will
have
the
loose
bits
of
cut
warp
pile
attached
where
the
material
is
extra
closely
woven
it
is
possible
for
every
weft
thread
that
is
withdrawn
to
have
the
loose
bits
attached
in
the
manner
described
fabrics
include
two
varieties
the
uncut

such
as
turkish
or
terry
towels
and
towelling
brussels
carpets
patent
tapestry
carpets
and
cut
pile
like
plushes
velvets
ribbons
etc
a
fabric
wherein
the
design
being
printed
on
the
warps
prior
to
weaving
appears
somewhat
faintly
and
in
an
indefinite
outline
chiné
the
term
warp
ribs
is
used
to
designate
a
weave
in
which
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
weft
threads
or
picks
or
to
the
grouping
together
of
a
number
of
weft
picks
the
warp
threads
are
made
to
bend
round
them
and
being
thus
thrown
to
the
surface
of
the
fabric
produce
a
ribbed
appearance
running
from
selvedge
to
selvedge
in
which
the
warp
threads
are
on
the
face
of
the
fabric
poplin

form
of
cotton
sateen
cloth
is
that
woven
with
a
warp
sateen
weave
on
the
five
threads
and
picks
system
which
results
in
of
the
warp
threads
appearing
on
the
face
of
the
fabric
and
therefore
of
the
weft
threads
appear
on
the
back
of
the
fabric
the
object
of
weaving
on
this
principle
is
to
obtain
a
smooth
cloth
surface
by
distributing
the
interlacing
points
and
so
destroying
the
common
twilled
effect
a
warp
sateen
will
be
much
closer
in
the
warp
threads
than
in
the
weft
threads
and
therefore
stronger
in
that
direction
a
fabric
having
thick
raised
cords
at
close
intervals
as
in
the
case
of
bedford
cords
and
piqués
in
cotton
goods
when
the
cords
run
lengthways
of
the
piece
the
fabric
is
known
as
a
warp
welt
sometimes
called
wale
a
fabric
which
shows
on
its
face
a
greater
number
of
warp
threads
than
picks
or
weft
threads
and
condenser
these
are
made
from
certain
waste
cotton
which
accumulates
in
certain
parts
of
the
machinery
during
the
process
of
spinning
yarn
this
waste
is
treated
by
special
machinery
which
spins
it
into
a
full
level
and
soft
yarn
which
is
used
for
weft
in
weaving
sheetings
and
cotton
mill
waste
is
the
derived
from
the
cotton
in
its
various
processes
through
the

each
pound
of
cotton
before
it
becomes
cloth
loses
on
an
average
per
cent
visible
and
invisible
waste
the
visible
waste
is
of
two
kinds
hard
and
soft
hard
waste
which
has
been
made
on
spinning
and
subsequent
machines
and
which
bears
a
slight
twist
soft
waste
which
includes
that
part
of
the
fibre
rejected
by
all
machines
up
to
the
spinning
frame
the
invisible
waste
is
equal
to
the
amount
of
evaporation
of
moisture
in
the
cotton
during
the
process
of
manufacture
flocks

short
fibres
removed
from

during
the
process
of
napping
cotton
fabrics
woven
from

and
of
low
grade
the
weft
thread
is
coarse
and
is
spun
from
waste
or
cotton
as
a
textile
term
it
is
used
to
designate
the
process
whereby
certain
distinctive
effects
are
produced
on
the
face
of
fabrics
especially
silks
the
process
of
giving
a
wavy
or
appearance
in
fabrics
by
either
passing
them
through
suitably
engraved
metal
rollers
which
bearing
unequally
upon
the
fabric
render
the
surface
unequal
making
it
reflect
light
differently
the
same
result
is
obtained
by
pressing
two
fabrics
together
when
the
coarser
weft
threads
of
the
fabric
produce
the
indentations
on
the
face
of
the
fabric
it
is
pressed
against
a
fabric
is
said
to
be
watered
when
ornamented
by
either
of
the
above
processes
the
principle
of
this
operation
is
that
two
fabrics
of
precisely
similar
build
when
pressed
together
naturally
water
each
other
owing
to
the
coincidence
or
of
the
threads
or
picks
causing
flatness
or
ribbedness
of
a
sufficiently
marked
character
under
conditions
of
heat
and
pressure
to
tabby
is
another
expression
for
to
water
and
the
adjective
tabby
usually
referring
to
a
brindled
cat
signifies
streaked
with
wavy
lines
every
woven
piece
of
cloth
is
made
up
of
two
distinct
systems
of
threads
known
as
the
warp
and
the
filling
this
latter
is
also
known
as
weft
which
are
interlaced
with
each
other
to
form
a
fabric
the
warp
threads
run
lengthways
of
the
piece
of
cloth
and
the
filling
or
weft
threads
run
across
from
side
to
side
the
manner
in
which
the
warp
and
filling
interlace
with
each
other
constitutes
the
weave
the
term
end
in
weaving
is
used
to
designate
the
warp
thread
while
each
weft
or
filling
thread
is
called
a
pick
the
fineness
of
a
cloth
is
expressed
by
saying
that
it
has
so
many
ends
and
picks
to
the
inch
the
character
of
the
weave
offers
the
best
basis
for
classification
of
woven
goods
and
nearly
all
varieties
of
cloth
may
be
classified
under
the
following
weaves
plain
weave
twill
weave
satin
weave
figure

web
is
the
name
given
to
a
piece
of
cloth
at
the
moment
it
is
taken
from
the
loom
and
previous
to
its
having
been
treated
to
produce
the
special
feature
of
the
class
of
cloth
the
web
belongs
to
when
the
word
weft
is
used
in
connexion
with
weaving

woven
fabrics
it
always
signifies
the
filling
threads
each
of

is
also
called
a

across
the
width
of
the
fabric
weft
pile
can
be
recognised
by
withdrawing
from
the
fabric
under
examination
a
few
picks
or
weft
threads
if
the

then
it
will
be

are
not
entangled

looped
round
or
adhering
to
the
weft
thread
that
has
been
drawn
out
but
that
they
remain
entangled
among
the
warp
threads
if
however
a
few
warp
threads
are
withdrawn
separately
it
will
be
found
that
every
alternate
warp
thread
as
a
rule
will
have
the
loose
bits
of
cut
weft
pile
attached
or
looped
round
the
only
difference
between
these
and
warp
ribs
is
that
the
weft
bends
and
the
warp
lies
straight
the
term
weft

is
used
to
designate
a

indeed
it
is
made
by
the

to
take
up
with
the

so
much
of
that
metal
that
ounces
of
boiled
silk
can
be
increased
in

the
chief
characteristic

derives
its

value
and
which
is
its
special
distinction

in
part
upon
the
kinks
in
the
fibre
but
mainly
upon
the
scales
with
which
the
fibre
is
covered
the
process
of
felting
consists
in
the
fibres
becoming
entangled
with
each
other
and
the
little
projecting
scales
hooking
into
each

wools
take
their

which
they
undergo
when

longer
than

one
another
are
shorter
than
combing
and
in
addition
they
possess
the
power
of
felting
that
is
to
say
of
matting
together
in
a
close
compact
mass
to
a
much
greater
degree
the

this
is
arrived
at
by

and
by
giving

this

this
results
in

it

only
in

a
pound
thus
no
cut
yarn
consists
of
yards
to
the
pound
a
similar
system
prevails
in
england
where
yards
go
to
the
cut
and
the
number
of
cuts
per
pound
equals
the
count
in
certain
parts
of
england
yorkshire
yards
go
to
the
hank
the
count
is
also
arrived
at
on
the
basis
that
the
number
of
yards
per
dram
equals
the
count
the
name
explains
itself
and
is
applied
to
a
worsted
cloth
having
as
its
chief
characteristic
a
prominent
weave
effect
running
diagonally
from
left
to
right
across
the
face
of
the
cloth
generally
in
solid
colours
and
finished
so
as
to
bring
the
weave
into
prominence
a
smooth
fabric
woven
from
worsted
warp
and
weft
having
a
effect
on
the
back
of
the
fabric
generally
black
worsted
lastings
average
to
inches
in
width
and
to
yards
in
length
per
piece
met
with
in
three
grades
of
quality
average
bradford
price
for
the
best
grade
was
for
the
years
ended
about
per
piece
is
a
straight
yarn
a
yarn
produced
from
straight
fibres
it
is
invaluable
in
the
production
of
textile
fabrics
in
which
lustre
and
uniformity
of
surface
are
the
chief
characteristics
they
enter
into
the
manufacture
of
zephyr
saxony
serge
bunting
rep
etc
yarn
is
measured
by
a
system
of
counts
the
number
of
yards
of
yarn
to
the
pound
it
is
put
up
in
hanks
of
yards
each
and
the
number
of
such
hanks
that
are
necessary
to
weigh
pound
determines
the
count
so
that
if
no
yarn
is
mentioned
it
is
a
yarn
hanks
of
which
or
yards
weigh
pound
the
main
characteristic
of
worsted
yarn
is
the
arrangement
of
the
fibres
which
are
so
arranged
that
they
are
parallel
to
each
other
in
a
longitudinal
direction
the
yarn
thus
produced
is
a
smooth
lustrous
and
level
yarn
these
qualities
being
absent
in
woollen
yarn
the
fibres
which
constitute
a
worsted
yarn
are
more
readily
separated
from
the
body
of
the
yarn
or
cloth
than
in
the
case
of
a
woollen
yarn
this
term
is
used
to
designate
a
fast
pile
and
originates
in
the
form
taken
by
a
piece
of
fast
pile
when
removed
from
the
fabric
in
a
fabric
the
pile
can
not
be
driven
out
through
the
back
of
the
fabric
by
pressure
applied
to
the
pile
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
pile
is
virtually
bound
into
the
material
and
held
in
place
by
two
threads
from
the
top
and
one
from
behind
pile
weave
underwear
this
class
of
underwear
is
essentially
a
knit
cotton
underwear
made
from
a
combination
of
bleached
cotton
yarn
and
dyed
yarn
the
knit
fabric
is
raised
on
the
inside
the
dyed
yarn
used
in
the
manufacture
of
this
class
of
underwear
is
often
of
a
blue
or
brown
colour
cotton
grey
or
in
its
unqualified
form
the
term
cotton
yarn
is
used
to
describe
single
yarns
and
cotton
yarn
grey
or

is
understood
to
be
cotton
thread
and
carded
yarn
warps
or

yarns
in
singles
whether
in
bundles
skeins
or
cops
not
advanced
beyond
the
condition
of

or
twisting
two
or
more
single
yarns
together
and
not
advanced
beyond
the
condition
of
bleached

printing
gassing
or

cotton
yarn
is
subdivided
into
three
groups
coarse
medium
and
fine

to
count
no
count
and
under
coarse
nos
to
medium
no
and
over

cotton
yarn
is
sometimes
found
as
a
mercerised
grey
yarn
the
fact
that
cotton
yarn
is
in
the
unbleached
state
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
not
been
advanced
beyond
that
stage
it
may
be
in

at
the

be
distinguished
from

by
unravelling
the
threads
of

show
that
the
has
penetrated
through

in
the
case
of

the
has
not
