this

it
does
cover
all

as

as
many
others
as

the

has
been
used
it
should
however
be
borne
in
mind
that
many
fabrics
are
known
in
the

by
a
variety
of
names
so
that
one
branch
of
the

may
not
recognise
a

applied
to
the

by
another

the

have
been
built
up
from
information
obtained
first

from
practical
weavers
manufacturers
wholesale
and

buyers
as

as
from

or

bar√©ge
was
for
the
name
seems
to
have
fallen
into
disuse
an
open
fabric
resembling
gauze
but
more
open
in
texture
and
stouter
in
thread
it
was
made
of
various
materials
but
is
best
known
as
made
of
silk
warp
and
worsted
weft
it
was
first
employed
as
ornament
for
the
head
especially
for
sacred
ceremonies
as
baptism
and
marriage
it
would
appear
therefore
from
the
above
that
balzarines
of
the
cotton
variety
would
be
a
gauze
weave
or
fabric
woven
from
cotton
warp
and
cotton
weft
they
may
have
been
either
bleached
dyed
printed
or
brocaded
the
exact
difference
between
balzarines
and
other
gauze
fabrics
does
not
appear
in
any
modern
works
dealing
with
textiles
the
fabric
probably
approximates
inches
in
width
and
from
to
yards
in
length
per
piece
unless
specially
designated
as
such
balzarines
are
free
from
brocaded
ornamentation
but
from
the
fact
that
they
are
found
associated
with
lenos
they
may
like
these
have
some
plain
weave
combined
with
the
main
gauze
structure
probably
running
in
stripes
lengthways
of
the
piece
is
a
term
applied
to
materials
that
have
been
dyed
in
a
somewhat
unusual
manner

being
tied
in
knots
prior
to

at
the

the

operation
of

consists
of
running

plain
crape
cloth
is
an
fabric
plain
woven
from
cotton
yarns
and
is
free
from
any
woven
or

ornamentation
the
nature
of
the
yarn
is
such
that
it
readily
shrinks
or
curls
in
length
when
not
kept
at
a
high
tension
this
together
with
subsequent
finishing
operations
causes
a
considerable
contraction
to
take
place
resulting
in
an
uneven
crinkled
surface
which
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
crape
the
crinkled
surface
in

crape
is
obtained
in
several
ways
by
combination
of
materials
by

combination
by
combination
of
and
by

arrangements
during

by
subjecting

specially
constructed
to

process
during

the
cheaper
grades
of
crape
have
the
crinkled
effect
produced
by
suitably
prepared
rollers
through
which
the
cloth
is
passed
and
the
crinkled
effect
in
cotton
crapes
is
not
always
the
result
of
true
crape
weaving
which
relies
on
the
irregularity
of
the
interweaving
of
threads
to
produce
the
crape
effect
in
width
crape
seldom
exceeds
inches

sometimes
made

material
in

the
unevenness
of

gives
a
rough
surface
to

are
various
grades
of

the
coarser

more
irregular
kinds
are
used
for

are
fabrics
which
have
as
their
distinctive
feature
cockled
striped
effects
these
crimped

cockled
stripes
are
produced
by
dividing
the
warp
threads
into
two
separate
beams
one
of
which
is
under
greater
tension
than
the
other
that
is
to
say
the
warp
threads
from
one
of
the
beams
will
be
tight
and
the
others
slack
these
slack
threads
in
the
process
of
weaving
are
taken
up
more
rapidly
and
form
the
crimped
stripes
crimps
may
also
be
produced
by
subjecting
fabrics
specially
constructed
to
a
special
chemical
process
during
finishing
or
by
passing
the
material
through
suitable
rollers
which
will
stretch
the
material
in
some
places
more
than
in

thus
artificially
produce

usually
of
a
large

the
weaves

are
twills
mostly
satin

and
the
figures
in
the

are
made
by
alternately
exchanging

damask
was

are
employed
principally
five

a
term
applied
to
materials
made
of

the
term
probably
originated
in
france
and
was
applied
there
to
all
fabrics
of
light
weight
made
of
wool
as
used
at
present
the
term
may
be
combined
with
another
name
and
then
purely
designates
the
nature
of
the
material
used
in
the
manufacture
of
the
fabric
such
as
in
muslin
delaine
a
stout
cotton
twill
cloth
generally
woven
as
a

the
warp
is
dyed
either
blue
or
brown
before

whilst
the
weft
is
grey
they
are
both
of
coarse

denim
being
a
material
has
the
warp
on
the
surface
and
as
the
warp
is
made
of
coloured
yarns
the
cloth
when
woven
shows
a
solid
coloured
surface
the
back
of
the
fabric
shows
the
bulk
of
the

this
name
is
applied
to
plain

character
and
originates
in
the
twill
effect
which
in
relation
to
the
length
of
the

this
twill
effect
is
produced
by
raising

this
term
as
applied
to

is
used
to
describe
two

principle
in
cotton
fabrics
it
is
confined
to

on
a
small
scale
the
weave
is
produced
by
the
interchanging
of
warp
and
weft
in
linen
fabrics
also
it
is
used
to
produce
diced
diamond
and
patterns
and
also
small

effect
being
due
to
the
coarse
weft
flushes
a
cheaper
kind
is
sometimes
made
by
arranging

they
differ
from

which
have
been
printed
in

in
such
a
manner
that
the

has
soaked
through

less
sharply
on

operations
first
on

side
then
on
the
other
side
of
a

this
being
the
essential
condition
for
a

it
follows
that
the
two

need
not
be
different

in
such
a
way
that
the

to
the

that

is
most
often
plain
woven
measuring
inches
by
to
yards

slightly
heavier
than

of
the

measurements
which
subsequent
to

has
been
the

the

this

in

being
presented
to
the
vision
and
not
the
sides
of

as
in
the

are
produced
by

to

raised
corrugations

lengthways

being
a

all
over

in

colour
it
differs
from

velvet
cords
only
as
regards
the
length
of

which
in
the
velveteen
variety
is
shorter
the
difference
between
this
class
of
material
and

is
that
corduroy
has
a
dividing
line
between

whilst

flannel
is
a
material
which
in

should
be
of
a
character
when
a

in
some
countries
as
much
as

of
cotton
is
allowed
in
an

when
a

it
is
scribbled

to
increase
the
strength
of
the

and
improve
its
spinning
properties
such
yarns
are
known
as
carded
unions
and
when
woven
will
produce
a

which
is
distinct
from

is
commonly
used
in
opposition
to

flannelette
can
be

composition
a
certain
amount
of

may
enter
unlike

which
from
its

name
shows
that
the
material
is
of

cotton
only
the

may
not

then
divide
the

again
a
grey
shirting
may
be
termed
a

the
difference
between
these
two
kinds
of

lies
in
the
fact
that
in
the
former

the
weaving
is
the
result
of
the

controlled
by

in
the
case
of

is
oftener
called

only
has
to
attend
to
the
broken

which
is
pulled
by

this
is
done
to
make
the

the

wholly

in

part
from

shoddy
there
actually
exists
a
technical
difference
between
mungo

shoddy
due
to
the
class
of
fabric
from
which
they
are
made
mungo
is
the
product
of
all
types
of
cloths
which
have
been
subjected
to
the
milling
process
shoddy
is
the
product
of
unmilled
fabrics
such
as
flannels
stockings
wraps
etc
mungo
is
usually
shorter
and
finer
in
fibre
than
shoddy
because
in
the
first
place
milled
cloths
are
nearly
always
made
from
the
shorter
kinds
of
wool
secondly
because
the
fibres
of
a
milled
cloth
are
very
difficult
to
separate
from
one
another
and
break
in
the
process
of
pulling
both
mungo
and
shoddy
are
rather
more
comprehensive
terms
than
names
for
any
special
type
of
material
both
classes
have
a
number
of
special
divisions
with
different
names
nainsook

which

it
may
be
distinguished
from

from
the
fact
that
it
has
not
as
firm
a
construction
nor
as
much
body
and
for
that
reason
is
not
capable
of
retaining
as

the
result
being
that
when

it
has
a
very
soft

an

the

point
the
statement
that
this

was
made
from

yellow
tint
was
for
a
long
time
discredited
but
it
is
now
certain
that
the
yellow
preserves
the
colour
of

composing
it

than
acquires

the
distinctive
feature
of
this

is
that
the
surface
consists
of
threads
standing
closely
together
like
bristles
in

these
threads
appear
either
as
threads
sheared
off
smooth
so
as
to
form
a
uniform

surface
as
in

or
may
appear
in
the
form
of

the
threads
forming
the

are
fixed
to
the
back
in
a
more

firm
manner
and
are
known
as
loose

out
of

or
again
they
may
be
drawn
out
through
the
back
of
the
material
by
relatively
little
scratching
with
say
the
edge
of
a
the
fast

can
not
be
so
withdrawn

the
nature
of

may
vary

they

stipulated
that

the

when
applied

qualifies
the

fabrics
requiring

backed
by
constructing
the

in
this
manner
the
raising
machine
in
the
subsequent
processes
partially
disintegrates
the

gives
that
soft

cloth
the
raising
or
napping
of
the
cloth
is
a
process
which
the
fabric
is
put
through
with
the
view
of
giving
it
a
soft
woolly
feel
by
passing
the
fabric
whilst
it
is
tightly
stretched
over
a
revolving
cylinder
which
has
its
surface
covered
with
small
steel
hooks
or
teasels
the
surface
of
the

is
scratched
and
the
short
fibres
of
the

in
the
weaving
are
opened
up
and
raised
resulting
in
a
nap
covering
the

raised
cotton
cloths
allow
of
the
use
of
coarse
inferior
yarns
and
are
better
looking
than
had
they
not

the

caused
by
the
use
of

to
say
in

so
on

then

is
what
is
technically
known
as
an

the
order
in
which
the

rises
being
once
in

times
the

the
better

whilst
in
the
lower
grades
of
this

cotton
is
generally
used

leaf
twills
satin
at
the

leaving
the

has
a
somewhat
flossy
and

surface
this
is
removed
by
passing

over
heated
metal
cylinders
which
destroy
the
minute
fibrous
ends
and
increase

black
satins
are
often
woven

a
selvedge
which
is
of
a

the
piece
when
a
drill
is
woven
with
a
sateen
weave
it
is
known
as
a

drill
to
distinguish
it
from
a
drill
woven
with
a
twill

is
known
as

thread
is
made
to

twelve
or
a
greater

lesser
number
of
warp
threads
and
the
order
in
which
this
is
done
is
irregular
the
filling
by
this
process
is
thus
placed
practically
all
on
the
face
of
the
cloth
and
this
style
of
weave
is
sometimes
called
a
satin

by
reversing
the
process
and
bringing
practically
all
the

or
an
imitation

the
true

silk
satin
woven
from
mercerised
cotton
or
other
yarns
it
is
similar
to
sateen
but
somewhat
lighter

the
term
is
used
to
describe
the
satin
weave
which
does
not
fulfil
the
conditions
of
the
real
satin
as
regards
the
order
of
intersection
of
warp
and
weft
this
like
all
other
special
finishes
is
the
result
of
a
process
through
which
a
fabric
is
passed
with
the
view
of
rendering
its
face
more
lustrous
capable
of
better
reflecting
light
and
hence
having
a
more
silky
appearance
a
schreiner
finish
is
given
to
a
woven
cloth
by
means
of
a
specially
engraved
steel
roller
this
roller
is
engraved
with
minute
lines
running
parallel
to
each
other

this
roller
has
been
suitably
heated
and
set
with
the
right
amount
of
pressure
the
cloth
is
run
between
it
and
a
plain
backing
roller
the
engraved
roller
which
comes
in
contact
with
the

impresses
on
it
minute
lines
which
can
readily
be
distinguished
by
means
of

a
schreiner
finish
is
often
known
as
a
milled
finish
when
any
two
or
more
kinds
of
fibres
have
been
thoroughly
mixed
together
prior
to
being
spun
into

they
are
said
to

the

go
towards

are
in
some
cases
made
of
a
stronger
material
than
that
used
for
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
folded
yarns
are
often
used
for
this
purpose
because
during
the
process
of
weaving
single
selvedge
yarns
are
liable
to
break
out
oftener
than
any
other
generally
on
account
of
the
pulling
action
of
the
weft

in
the
shuttle
as
it
is
picked

this
is
more
particularly
the
case

cottons
selvedges
are
that
part
of
the
fabric
by
which
it
is
held
out
in
a
stretched
position
in
many
of
the
stages
of
finishing
in
the
textile
trade
generally
it
is
often
stated
that
a

shows
a
good

are
mounted
on

frames
to
which
they
are

have
these
selvedges
reinforced
by

threads
selvedges
or
lists
of
a
colour
different
but
of
a
material
similar
to
that
of
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
denote
that
the
fabric
has
been
woven
of
dyed
yarns
and
that
it
has
not
been
obviously
if
the
selvedge
would
be
of
the
same
colour
as
the
bulk
of
the
fabric
distinctive
styles
of
selvedges
have
given
rise
to
special
names
of
fabrics
such
as
spanish
stripes
the
actual
quality
of
a
fabric
can
not
be
always
told
by
the
selvedge
but
other
conditions
being
equal
it
then
becomes
a
good
guide
to
quality
a

selvedge
thread
or

or
the
initials
of
the
manufacturer
in
silk
appearing
on
the
selvedge
of

fabric
generally
denotes
a
superior
quality
of

the
following
from
a
work
dealing
with
cotton
fabrics
shows
the
generally
accepted
value
of
selvedges
as
an
indication
of
quality
advertising
has
educated
the
retail
dealers
and
consumers
to
the
fact
that
cotton
warp
goods
with
a
white
selvedge
the
ground
being
of
colour
are
more
to
be
depended
upon
not
to
crock
than
similar
cloths
of
solid
colour
cotton
all
fabric
woven
with
a
decided
twill
and
having
a
special
finish
imitating
wool
usually
printed
with
stripes
to
imitate
woven
effects
a
fabric
of
comparatively
recent
creation
having
as
a
distinctive
feature
the
design
printed
on
the
warp
threads
the
filling
is
generally
white
but
is
sometimes
to
a
shade
approximating
the
general
tone
of
the
large
floral
decorations
which
are
generally
used
in
this
class
of
fabric
the
warp
threads
take
the
colouring
matter
in
such
a
way
that
when
woven
the
design
or
pattern
appears
equally
on
both
sides
of
the
fabric
in
somewhat
blurred
and
softened
tones
from
the
fact
that
the
fabric
is
reversible
shows
a
design
on
both
sides
it
has
sometimes
been
called
a
reversible
cretonne
but
the
true
reversible
cretonne
is
the
result
of
printing
on
a
woven
fabric
and
not

artificial

very
rapidly

a
simple
way
of
recognising

is
by
testing
the

under

unravel
a
few
threads
of
the
suspected

and
place
them
in
the
mouth
and
masticate
them
thoroughly
artificial

readily
softens
under
this
operation
and
breaks
up
into

particles

linen
yarns
are
more
irregular

longitudinally
than

taken
from

this
difference
makes
the
detection
of
linen
in
a
woven
cloth
comparatively
easy
the
fibres
are
straighter
longer
and
stronger

the

the
oil
test
for
linen
is
based
upon
the
property
which
linen
has
of
more
readily
absorbing
oil
than
cotton
does
when
a
linen
and
cotton
mixture
fabric
which
has
been
freed
from
dressing
by
washing
and
boiling
is
dipped
in
oil
and
then
held
up
to
the
light
it
will
be
seen
that
the
linen
fibres
look
transparent
whereas
the
cotton
remains
more
nearly
opaque
this
is
due
to
the
linen
having
absorbed
the
oil
more
readily
than
the
cotton
all
the
cotton
contained
in
a
linen

cotton
fabric
can
be
readily
dissolved
by
dipping
the
fabric
in
a
concentrated
sulphuric
acid
bath
for
one
or
two
minutes
the
sample
is
first
freed
of

a
sample
so
tested

linen
fibre
only
will
remain
for
mercerised
prepare
a
solution
made
by
dissolving
ounces
of
iodide
of
potassium
in
ounces
of
water
then
add
to
this
solution
ounce
of
iodine
and
mix
with
another
solution
made
by
dissolving
ounces
of
zinc
chloride
in
ounces
of
water
the
test
is
applied
as
follows
take
the
suspect
sample
and
free
it
from
any
dressing
or
sizing
by
soaking
it
in
water
then
after
freeing
the
sample
from
any
superfluous
water
place
it
in
some
of
the
prepared
solution
for
three
minutes
and
then
rinse
the
sample
in
water
should
the
cotton
tested
have
been
mercerised
it
will
appear
of
a
deep
blue
colour
on
washing
with
water
the
blue
colour
fades
very
slowly
and
needs
long
washing
whereas
ordinary
cotton
rapidly
becomes
white
on
washing
even
dyed
piece
goods
will
show
the
deep
blue
reaction
which
is
the
result
of
the
testing
solution
acting
upon
the
caustic
soda
used
in
the
process
of
mercerisation
when
making
this
test
it
is
best
to
treat
a
known
unmercerised
cotton
at
the
same
time
as
the
suspect
sample
so
as
to
have
a
basis
for
comparison
for
if
a
silk
and
wool
mixture
or
union
fabric
is
boiled
in
strong
hydrochloric
acid
for
minutes
it
will
be
found
that
the
wool
merely
swells
whilst
the
silk
acted
upon
by
the
acid
completely
dissolves
by
careful
weighing
before
and
after
the
test
it
becomes
a
matter
of
simple
calculation
to
arrive
at
the
percentage
of
silk
present
in
the
fabric
for
if
a
fabric
suspected
of
containing
wool
and
cotton
or
other
vegetable
fibre
is
boiled
for
minutes
in
a
solution
made
by
dissolving
either
ounce
of
caustic
soda
or
caustic
potash
in
a
pint
of
water
it
will
be
found
that
all
the
wool
will
be
destroyed
and
only
the
vegetable
fibres
remain
this
test
which
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
caustic
soda
dissolves
wool
may
be
used
to
ascertain
the
percentage
of
wool
in
a
cloth
if
the
sample
tested
is
thoroughly
washed
dried
and
weighed
before
the
test
is
applied
after
testing
and
drying
the
loss
in
weight
represents
the
amount
of
wool
which
was
present
and
destroyed
during
the
test
this
test
may
be
reversed
and
the
cotton
destroyed
by
treating
the
sample
with
an
per
cent
sulphuric
acid
solution
this
however
is
a
longer
test
necessitating
the
sample
being
kept
in
the
sulphuric
acid
solution
for
about
or
hours
prior
to
drying
and
weighing
the
sample
should
be
well
washed
in
alcohol
the
principal
fibres
which
enter

ticking
belongs
to
the
class
of

this
feature
is
due
to
the
twill

are
made
usually
in
two
coloured

one
feature
which
is
worthy
of
mention
in
regard
to
ticking
and
other
similar
lines
is
that
they
are
being
in
increasing
quantities
this
method
consists
of
dyeing
the
cotton
or
bleaching
it
as
the
case
may
be
in
the
raw
state
and
then

is
a

the
warp
threads
are
closer
together
than
the
filling
threads
the
twilled
lines
produced
will
approach
more
the
horizontal
twill
weaving
permits
the
introduction
of
more
material
into
the
cloth
than
a
plain

and
produces
therefore
a
closer
and
heavier
fabric
a
twill
effect
in
a

is
also
called
a
diagonal
from
the
direction
it
has
in
relation
to
the

this
diagonal
effect
is
continually
produced
by
the
warp

weft
intersections
traversing
one
thread
and
one
pick
further
from
their
respective
positions
each
time
a
pick
of

is
inserted
twill
weaves
may
be
divided
into
four
common
classes
regular
broken
fancy
figured
a
regular
twill
is
referred
to
as
a
twill
of
so
many
ends
or
shafts
by
this
is
meant
a
twill
which
contains
a
number
of
warp
and
weft
threads
which
added
together
equal
the
number
of
ends
thus
a
twill
can
either
have
four
warps
and
one
weft
three
warps
and
two
wefts
or
two
warps
and
three
wefts
this
form
of
twill
will
be
seen
to
be
a
reverse
weave
to
a
twill
effect
produces
a
twill
line
which
when
the
number
of
warp
and
weft
threads
are
equal
is
at
an
angle
of
degrees
in
a
broken
twill
effect
this
line
which
may
be
compared
to
the
stroke
of
a
letter
v
is
combined
with
another
twill
line
running
in
an
opposite
direction
and
which
is
simply
a
turning
or
reversing
of
the
threads
in
the
regular
twill
weave
broken

largely
into

a
style
of

retaining
the
main
features

has
been
made
fancy

alternating
the
arrangements
of

they
are
also
called

and
the

may
be
arrived
at
by
intermingling
the

fibres
to

weft
which
is
in

and
subsequently
the

this
being
possible
as
the

the

all
authorities
do
not
agree
as
to
what
constitutes
a
union
the
following
definition
having
been
met
with
fabrics
are
union
when
composed
of
two
materials
otherwise
than
by
blending
in
the
morley
yorkshire
trade
a
union
is
a
cotton
warp
cloth
of
boiled
and
teazled
finish
superficially
resembling
broadcloth
these
yarns
as
the
name
indicates
are
the
product
of
combining
two
or
more
different
materials
into
a
yarn
generally
wool
and
cotton
or
wool
and
any
of
the
many
vegetable
fibres
capable
of
being
spun
union
yarns
may
be
produced
by
the
mixing
together
of
the
two
or
more
different
fibres
when
they
are
still
in
the
state
of
loose
fibres
in
such
a
case
the
cotton
fibres
act
as
binders
upon
the
rest
of
the
fibres
when
the
various
fibres
are
thoroughly
mixed
together
the
mixture
obtained
is
spun
this
produces
the
variety
known
as
carded
union
yarns
another
form
of
union
yarn
is
obtained
by
twisting
together
two
threads
of
different
material
some
union
yarns
have
the
appearance
of
pure
wool
threads
and
only
careful
scrutiny
will
reveal
the
presence
of
cotton
fibre
this
type
of
yarn
is
known
by
the
name
of
angola
yarn
union
yarns
being
composed
of
materials
that
are
not
affected
by
dyes
in
the
same
way
can
be
recognised
when
found
in
a
wool
fabric
from
the
fact
that
the
wool
in
the
yarn
will
have
taken
up
the
dye
whereas
the
cotton
will
not
have
done
so

hence
its
use
in

there
is
a
considerable
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
the
precise
cloth
designated
by
the
term
velour
some
manufacturers
would
class
as
velours
any
cloth
having
a
soft
velvety
nap
others
make
finer
distinctions
classing
one
as
a
cashmere

of
which
is
that
the

be
recognised
by
simply
withdrawing
from
the

being
examined
a
few

looped
and
adhering
to
some
of
the
drawn

this
can
be
easily
seen
if
a
common
velvet
ribbon
is
experimented
with
when
upon
drawing
out
the
weft
threads
separately
from

the
term
warp
ribs
is
used
to
designate
a

in
which
owing
to
the

or
to
the
grouping

the
warp

are
made
to
bend
round
them
and
being
thus
thrown
to
the

produce
a
ribbed
appearance

is
to
obtain
a
smooth

by
distributing
the

so
destroying
the
common

effect
a

sometimes
called
wale
a

made
from
certain
waste
cotton
which

term
it
is
used
to
designate
the
process
whereby
certain
distinctive
effects
are
produced
on
the
face
of
fabrics
especially
silks
the
process
of
giving
a
wavy
or
appearance
in
fabrics
by
either
passing
them
through
suitably
engraved
metal
rollers
which
bearing
unequally
upon
the
fabric
render
the
surface
unequal
making
it
reflect
light
differently
the
same
result
is
obtained
by
pressing
two
fabrics
together
when
the
coarser
weft
threads
of
the
fabric
produce
the
indentations
on
the
face
of
the
fabric
it
is
pressed
against
a
fabric
is
said
to
be
watered
when
ornamented
by
either
of
the
above
processes
the
principle
of
this
operation
is
that
two
fabrics
of
precisely
similar
build
when
pressed
together
naturally
water
each
other
owing
to
the
coincidence
or
of
the
threads
or

causing
flatness
or
ribbedness
of
a
sufficiently
marked
character
under
conditions
of
heat
and
pressure
to
tabby
is
another
expression
for
to
water
and
the
adjective
tabby
usually
referring
to
a
brindled
cat
signifies
streaked
with
wavy
lines
every
woven
piece
of
cloth
is
made
up
of
two
distinct
systems
of
threads
known
as
the
warp
and
the
filling
this
latter
is
also
known
as
weft
which
are
interlaced
with
each
other
to
form
a
fabric
the
warp
threads
run
lengthways
of
the
piece
of
cloth
and
the
filling
or
weft
threads
run
across
from
side
to
side
the
manner
in
which
the
warp
and
filling
interlace
with
each
other
constitutes
the
weave
the
term
end
in
weaving
is
used
to
designate
the
warp
thread
while
each
weft
or
filling
thread
is
called
a
pick
the
fineness
of
a
cloth
is
expressed
by
saying
that
it
has
so
many
ends
and
picks
to
the
inch
the
character
of
the
weave
offers
the
best
basis
for
classification
of
woven
goods
and
nearly
all
varieties
of

may
be
classified
under
the
following
weaves
plain

been
treated
to

to
when
the

as
a
rule
will
have
the
loose

round
the
only
difference
between
these

the
chief
characteristic

which
is
its
special
distinction

in
part
upon
the
kinks
in
the
fibre
but
mainly
upon
the
scales
with
which
the
fibre
is
covered
the
process
of
felting
consists
in
the
fibres
becoming
entangled
with
each
other
and
the
little
projecting
scales
hooking
into
each

wools
take
their

which
they
undergo
when
being

longer
than

shorter
than
combing
and
in
addition
they
possess
the
power
of
felting
that
is
to
say
of
matting
together
in
a
close
compact
mass
to
a
much
greater
degree
the

this
is
arrived
at
by
using

and
by
giving

this

this
results
in

it

yarn
is
based
on
the
cut
each
cut
consisting
of
yards
and
the
count
is
the
number
of
cuts
in
a
pound
thus
no
cut
yarn
consists
of
yards
to
the
pound
a
similar
system
prevails
in
england
where
yards
go
to
the
cut
and
the
number
of
cuts
per
pound
equals
the
count
in
certain
parts
of
england
yorkshire
yards
go
to
the
hank
the
count
is
also
arrived
at
on
the
basis
that
the
number
of
yards
per
dram
equals
the
count
the
name
explains
itself
and
is
applied
to
a
worsted
cloth
having
as
its
chief
characteristic
a
prominent
weave
effect
running
diagonally
from
left
to
right
across
the
face
of
the
cloth
generally
in
solid
colours
and
finished
so
as
to
bring
the
weave
into
prominence
a
smooth
fabric
woven
from
worsted
warp
and
weft
having
a
effect
on
the
back
of
the
fabric
generally
black
worsted
lastings
average
to
inches
in
width
and
to
yards
in
length
per
piece
met
with
in
three
grades
of
quality
average
bradford
price
for
the
best
grade
was
for
the
years
ended
about
per
piece
is
a
straight
yarn
a
yarn
produced
from
straight
fibres
it
is
invaluable
in
the
production
of
textile
fabrics
in
which
lustre
and
uniformity
of
surface
are
the
chief
characteristics
they
enter
into
the
manufacture
of
zephyr
saxony
serge
bunting
rep
etc
yarn
is
measured
by
a
system
of
counts
the
number
of
yards
of
yarn
to
the
pound
it
is
put
up
in
hanks
of
yards
each
and
the
number
of
such
hanks
that
are
necessary
to
weigh
pound
determines
the
count
so
that
if
no
yarn
is
mentioned
it
is
a
yarn
hanks
of
which
or
yards
weigh
pound
the
main
characteristic
of
worsted
yarn
is
the
arrangement
of
the
fibres
which
are
so
arranged
that
they
are
parallel
to
each
other
in
a
longitudinal
direction
the
yarn
thus
produced
is
a
smooth
lustrous
and
level
yarn
these
qualities
being
absent
in
woollen
yarn
the
fibres
which
constitute
a
worsted
yarn
are
more
readily
separated
from
the
body
of
the
yarn
or
cloth
than
in
the
case
of
a
woollen
yarn
this
term
is
used
to
designate
a
fast
pile
and
originates
in
the
form
taken
by
a
piece
of
fast
pile
when
removed
from
the
fabric
in
a
fabric
the
pile
can
not
be
driven
out
through
the
back
of
the
fabric
by
pressure
applied
to
the
pile
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
pile
is
virtually
bound
into
the
material
and
held
in
place
by
two
threads
from
the
top
and
one
from
behind
pile
weave
underwear
this
class
of
underwear
is
essentially
a
knit
cotton
underwear
made
from
a
combination
of
bleached
cotton
yarn
and
dyed
yarn
the
knit
fabric
is
raised
on
the
inside
the
dyed
yarn
used
in
the
manufacture
of
this
class
of
underwear
is
often
of
a
blue
or
brown
colour
cotton
grey
or
in
its
unqualified
form
the
term
cotton
yarn
is
used
to
describe
single
yarns
and
cotton
yarn
grey
or
bleached
is
understood
to
be
cotton
thread
and
carded
yarn
warps
or
warp
yarns
in
singles
whether
in
bundles
skeins
or
cops
not
advanced
beyond
the
condition
of
singles
by
grouping
or
twisting
two
or
more
single
yarns
together
and
not
advanced
beyond
the
condition
of
bleached
by
dyeing
colouring
printing
gassing
or
mercerising
cotton
yarn
is
subdivided
into
three
groups
coarse
medium
and
fine
according
to
count
no
count
and
under
coarse
nos
to
medium
no
and
over
fine
cotton
yarn
is
sometimes
found
as
a
mercerised
grey
yarn
the
fact
that
cotton
yarn
is
in
the
unbleached
state
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
has
not
been
advanced
beyond
that
stage
it
may
be
in
the
grey
and
at
the
same
time
be
mercerised
cabled
yarns
and
folded
yarn
goods
are
made
of
yarns
that
are
dyed
before
being
woven
or
yarns
spun
from
wool
that
has
previously
been
dyed
may
be
distinguished
from
fabrics
by
unravelling
the
threads
of
each
kind
fabrics
show
that
the
has
penetrated
through
the
yarn
while
in
the
case
of
fabrics
the
has
not
the
same
chance
of
penetrating
the
yarn
as
completely
lightly
constructed

finished
