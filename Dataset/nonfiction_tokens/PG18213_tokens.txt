the

great
campaign
on
the
western
battle
grounds
in
the
european
war
began
on
august
on
this
day
the
german
army
began
its
invasion
of
belgium
with
the
conquest
of
france
as
its
ultimate
goal
six
mighty
armies
stood
ready
for
the
great
invasion
their
estimated
total
was
men
supreme
over
all
was
the
emperor
as
war
lord
but
lieutenant
general
helmuth
van
moltke
chief
of
the
general
staff
was
the
practical
director
of
military
operations
general
van
moltke
was
a
nephew
of
the
great
strategist
of
and
his
name
possibly
appealed
as
of
happy
augury
for
repeating
the
former
capture
of
paris
the
first
army
was
assembled
at
in
the
north
of
belgium
within
a
few
miles
of
the
dutch
frontier
it
was
under
the
command
of
general
van
kluck
he
was
a
veteran
of
both
the
austrian
and
wars
and
was
regarded
as
an
able
infantry
leader
his
part
was
to
enter
belgium
at
its
northern
triangle
which
projects
between
holland
and
germany
occupy
liege
deploy
on
the
great
central
plains
of
belgium
then
sweep
toward
the
french
northwestern
frontier
in
the
german
dash
for
paris
and
the
english
channel
his
army
thus
formed
the
right
wing
of
the
whole
german
offensive
it
was
composed
of
picked
corps
including
cavalry
of
the
prussian
guard
the
second
army
had
gathered
in
the
neighborhood
of
limbourg
under
the
command
of
general
von
bülow
its
advance
was
planned
down
the
valleys
of
the
ourthe
and
vesdre
to
a
junction
with
von
kluck
at
liege
then
a
march
by
the
meuse
valley
upon
namur
and
charleroi
in
crossing
the
sambre
it
was
to
fall
into
place
on
the
left
of
von
kluck
army
the
german
center
was
composed
of
the
third
army
under
duke
albrecht
of
württemberg
the
fourth
army
led
by
the
crown
prince
and
the
fifth
army
commanded
by
the
crown
prince
of
bavaria
it
was
assembled
on
the
line
its
first
offensive
was
the
occupation
of
luxemburg
this
was
performed
after
a
somewhat
dramatic
protest
by
the
youthful
grand
duchess
who
placed
her
motor
car
across
the
bridge
by
which
the
germans
entered
her
internationally
guaranteed
independent
state
the
german
pretext
was
that
since
luxemburg
railways
were
german
controlled
they
were
required
for
the
transport
of
troops
preparations
were
then
made
for
a
rapid
advance
through
the
ardennes
upon
the
central
meuse
to
form
in
order
upon
the
left
of
von
bülow
army
a
part
of
the
fifth
army
was
to
be
detached
for
operations
against
the
french
fortress
of
verdun
the
sixth
army
was
concentrated
at
strassburg
in
alsace
under
general
von
heeringen
as
inspector
of
the
prussian
guards
he
bore
a
very
high
military
reputation
for
the
time
being
general
von
heeringen
part
was
to
remain
in
alsace
to
deal
with
a
possibly
looked
for
strong
french
offensive
by
way
of
the
vosges
or
belfort
the
main
plan
of
the
german
general
staff
therefore
was
a
wide
enveloping
movement
by
the
first
and
second
armies
to
sweep
the
shore
of
the
english
channel
in
their
march
on
paris
a
vigorous
advance
of
the
center
through
the
ardennes
for
the
same
destination
and
readiness
for
battle
by
the
sixth
army
for
any
french
force
which
might
be
tempted
into
alsace
that
this
plan
was
not
developed
in
its
entirety
was
due
to
circumstances
which
fall
into
another
place

the
long
anticipated
dawned
their
vast
military
machine
moved
with
precision
and
unity
but
there
was
a
surprise
awaiting
them
the
belgians
were
to
offer
a
serious
resistance
to
passage
through
their
territory
a
firm
refusal
had
been
delivered
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
vanguard
was
thrown
forward
from
von
army
at
aix
to
break
through
the
defenses
of
liege
and
seize
the
western
railways
this
force
of
three
divisions
was
commanded
by
general
von
emmich
one
of
them
joining
him
at

on
the
evening
of

situated
on
the
meuse
north
of

and
close
to
the

frontier

an
engagement
took
place
with
a
belgian
guard
which
terminated
with
the
germans
bombarding
visé
the
belgians
had
destroyed
the
river

but
the
germans
succeeded
in
seizing
the
crossing
this
was
the
first
actual
hostility
of
the
war
on

with
the
capture
of
visé
the
way
was
clear
for
von
main
army
to
concentrate
on
belgian
territory
by
nightfall
liege
was
invested
on

in
revealing
its
three
days
siege
with
the
resulting
effect
upon
the
western
theatre
of
war
liege
is
the
capital
of
the
walloons
a
sturdy
race
that
in
times
past
has
at
many
a
crisis
proved
unyielding
determination
and
courage
at
the
outbreak
of
war
it
was
the
center
of
great
coal
mining
and
industrial
activity
in
the
commercial
world
it
is
known
everywhere
for
the
manufacture
of
firearms
the
smoke
from
hundreds
of
factories
spreads
over
the
city
often
hanging
in
dense
clouds
it
might
aptly
be
termed
the
pittsburg
of
belgium
the
city

in
a
deep
broad
cut
of
the
river
meuse
at
its
junction
with
the
combined
channels
of
the
ourthe
and

it
stretches
across
both
sides
being
connected
by
numerous
bridges
while

lines
of

course
of
the
main

the

line
from

belgium
crosses
the
meuse
at
liege
for
the
most
part
the
old
city
of
lofty
houses
clings
to
a
cliffside
on
the
left
bank
crowned
by
an
ancient
citadel
of
no
modern
defensive
value
whatever
picturesqueness
liege
may
have
possessed
is
effaced
by
the
squalid
and
dilapidated
condition
of
its
poorer
quarters

out
of
the
liege

to
expand
through
what
is
termed
the
dutch
flats
liege
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
was
a
place
of
great
wealth
and
extreme
poverty
a
liege
artisan
considered
himself
in
prosperity
on
a
week
it
was
of
the
first
strategic
importance
to
belgium
its
situation
was
that
of
a
natural
fortress
barring
the
advance
of
a
german
army
the
defenses
of
liege
were
hardly
worth
an
enemy
gunfire
before
they
had
consisted
of
a
single
fort
on
the
meuse
right
bank
and
the
citadel
crowning
the
heights
of
the
old
town
but
subsequently
the
belgian
chamber
voted
the
necessary
sums
for
fortifying
liege
and
namur
on
the
latest
principles
from
the
plans
submitted
the
one
finally
decided
upon
was
that
of
the
famous
belgian
military
engineer
henri
alexis
brialmont
his
design
was
a
circle
of
detached
forts
already
approved
by
german
engineers
as
best
securing
a
city
within
from
bombardment
with
regard
to
liege
and
namur
particularly
brialmont
held
that
his
plan
would
make
passages
of
the
meuse
at
those
places
impregnable
to
an
enemy
when
the
german
army
stood
before
liege
on
this
fourth
day
of
august
in
the
circumference
of
the
detached
forts
was
miles
with
about
two
or
three
miles
between
them
and
at
an
average
of
five
miles
from
the
city
each
fort
was
constructed
on
a
new
model
to
withstand
the
highest
range
and
power
of
offensive
artillery
forecast
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
completed
they
presented
the
form
of
an
armored
mushroom
thrust
upward
from
a
mound
by
subterranean
machinery
the
elevation
of
the
cupola
in
action
disclosed
no
more
of
its
surface
than
was
necessary
for
the
firing
of
the
guns
the
mounds
were
turfed
and
so
inconspicuous
that
in
times
of
peace
sheep
grazed
over
them
in
brialmont
original
plan
each
fort
was
to
be
connected
by
infantry
trenches
with
sunken
emplacements
for
light
artillery
but
this
important
part
of
his
design
was
relegated
to
the
dangerous
hour
of
a
threatening
enemy
this
work
was
undertaken
too
late
before
the
onsweep
of
the
germans
instead
brialmont
single
weak
detail
in
surrounding
each
fort
with
an
infantry
platform
was
tenaciously
preserved
long
after
its
uselessness
must
have
been
apparent
thus
liege
was
made
a
ring
fortress
to
distinguish
it
from
the
former
latest
pattern
of
earth
ramparts
and
outworks
six
major
and
six
minor
of
these
forts
encircled
liege
from
north
to
south
beginning
with
those
facing
the
german
frontier
their
names
ran
as
follows
barchon
evegnée
fleron
embourg
boncelles
flemalle
hollogne
loncin
lantin
liers
and
pontisse
the
armaments
of
the
forts
consisted
of
and
guns
with
mortars
and
quick
firers
they
were
in
the
relative
number
of
two
four
two
and
four
for
the
major
forts
and
two
two
one
and
three
for
the
minor
as
such
were
termed
the
grand
total
was
estimated
at
pieces
in
their
confined
underground
quarters
the
garrisons
even
of
the
major
forts
did
not
exceed
eighty
men
from
the
engineer
artillery
and
infantry
branches
of
the
service
between
fort
pontisse
and
the
dutch
frontier
was
less
than
six
miles
it
was
through
this
otherwise
undefended
gap
that
von
kluck
purposed
to
advance
his
german
army
after
the
presumed
immediate
fall
of
liege
to
that
end
having
seized
the
meuse
crossing
at
visé
the
railway
line
to
was
dominated
by
fort
fleron
while
the
minor
forts
chaudfontaine
and
embourg
to
the
south
commanded
the
trunk
line
by
way
of
liege
into
belgium
on
the
plateau
above
liege
fort
loncin
held
the
railway
junction
of
ans
and
the
lines
running
from
liege
north
and
west
finally
the
forts
were
not
constructed
on
a
geometric
circle
but
in
such
manner
that
the
fire
of
any
two
was
calculated
to
hold
an
enemy
at
bay
should
a
third
between
them
fall
this
was
probably
an
accurate
theory
before
german
guns
of
an
unimagined
caliber
and
range
were
brought
into
action
in
command
of
the
belgian
forts
at
liege
was
general
leman
he
had
served
under
brialmont
and
was
pronounced
a
serious
and
efficient
officer
he
was
a
zealous
military
student
physically
extremely
active
and
constantly
on
the
watch
for
any
relaxation
of
discipline
these
qualities
enabled
him
to
grasp
at
the
outset
the
weakness
of
his
position
if
the
germans
believed
the
refusal
to
grant
a
free
passage
for
their
armies
through
belgium
to
be
little
more
than
a
diplomatic
protest
it
would
seem
the
belgian
government
was
equally
mistaken
in
doubting
the
germans
would
force
a
way
through
an
international
treaty
of
belgian
neutrality
consequently
the
german
crossing
of
the
frontier
discovered
belgium
with
her
mobilization
but
half
complete
mainly
on
a
line
for
the
defense
of
brussels
and
antwerp
it
had
been
estimated
by
brialmont
that
men
of
all
arms
were
necessary
for
the
defense
of
liege
on
a
war
footing
probably
was
the
total
force
hastily
gathered
in
the
emergency
to
withstand
the
german
assault
on
the
fortifications
it
included
the
civic
guard
general
leman
realized
therefore
that
without
a
supporting
field
army
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
hold
the
german
hosts
before
liege
for
more
than
a
few
days
a
week
at
most
but
he
hoped
within
such
time
the
french
or
british
would
march
to
his
relief
thus
his
chief
concern
was
for
the
forts
protecting
the
railway
leading
from
namur
down
the
meuse
valley
into
liege
the
line
of
a
french
or
british
advance
on
the
afternoon
of
august
german
patrols
appeared
on
the
left
bank
of
the
meuse
approaching
from
visé
they
were
also
observed
by
the
sentries
on
forts
barchon
evegnée
and
fleron
german
infantry
and
artillery
presently
came
into
view
with
the
unmistakable
object
of

the
attack
on
those
forts
the
forts
fired
a
few
shots
by
way
of
a
challenge
as
evening
fell
the
woods
began
to
echo
with
the
roar
of
artillery
later
forts
fleron
chaudfontaine
and
embourg
were
added
to
the
german
bombardment
the
germans
used
long
range
field
pieces
with
powerful
explosive
shells
the
fire
proved
to
be
remarkably
accurate
as
their
shells
exploded
on
the
cupolas
and
platforms
of
the
forts
the
garrisons
in
their
confined
citadels
began
to
experience
that
inferno
of
vibrations
which
subsequently
deprived
them
of
the
incentive
to
eat
or
sleep
the
belgians
replied
vigorously
but
owing
to
the
broken
nature
of
the
country
and
the
forethought
with
which
the
germans
took
advantage
of
every
form
of
gun
cover
apparently
little
execution
was
dealt
upon
the
enemy
however
the
belgians
claimed
to
have
silenced
two
of
the
german
pieces
in
the
darkness
of
this
historic
night
of
august
the
flames
of
the
fortress
guns
pierced
the
immediate
night
with
vivid
streaks
their
searchlights
swept
in
broad
streams
the
wooded
slopes
opposite
the
cannonade
resounded
over
liege
as
if
with
constant
peals
of
thunder
in
the
city
civilians
sought
the
shelter
of
their
cellars
but
few
of
the
german
shells
escaped
their
range
upon
the
forts
to
disturb
them
this
exchange
of
artillery
went
on
until
near
daybreak
of
august
when
infantry
fire
from
the
woods
to
the
right
of
fort
embourg
apprised
the
defenders
that
the
germans
were
advancing
to
the
attack
the
germans
came
on
in
their
customary
massed
formation
the
prevalent
opinion
that
in
german
tactics
such
action
was
employed
to
hearten
the
individual
soldier
was
denied
by
their
general
staff
in
their
opinion
an
advantage
was
thus
gained
by
the
concentration
of
rifle
fire
belgian
infantry
withstood
the
assault
and
when
dawn
broke
a
general
engagement
was
in
progress
about
eight
the
germans
were
compelled
to
withdraw
illustration
beginning
of
german
invasion
of
belgium
the
first
engagement
of
the
war
was
won
by
the
belgians
it
was
reported
that
the
belgian
fire
had
swept
the
germans
down
in
thousands
but
this
was
denied
by
german
authorities
up
to
this
time
the
german
forces
before
liege
were
chiefly
von
kluck
vanguard
under
von
emmich
his
second
line
of
advance
and
detachments
of
von
bülow
army
on
the
belgian
side
no
attempt
was
made
to
follow
up
the
advantage
the
reason
given
is
that
the
germans
were
seen
to
be
in
strong
cavalry
force
an
arm
lost
totally
in
the
military
complement
of
liege
the
german
losses
were
undoubtedly
severe
especially
in
front
of
fort
barchon
this
was
one
of
the
major
forts
triangular
in
shape
and
surrounded
by
a
ditch
and
barbed
wire
entanglements
the
armament
of
these
major
forts
had
recently
been
reenforced
by
night
secretly
with
guns
of
heavier
caliber
from
antwerp
as
they
outmatched
the
german
field
pieces
of
the
first
attack
presumably
the
german
intelligence
department
had
failed
in
news
of
them
an
armistice
requested
by
the
germans
to
gather
in
the
wounded
and
bury
the
dead
was
refused
thereupon
the
artillery
duel
recommenced
a
hot
and
oppressive
day
disclosed
woods
rent
and
scarred
standing
wheat
fields
and
trampled
and
farm
houses
set
ablaze
the
bringing
of
the
belgian
wounded
into
liege
apprised
the
citizens
that
their
side
had
also
suffered
considerably
meanwhile
the
germans
were
reenforced
by
the
tenth
hanoverian
army

from
command
of
which
general
von

had
been

the

advanced
in

by
short
rushes

to

onward
with
unflinching
determination
the
forts
wreathed
in

spraying
streams
of
bullets
the
germans
were
repulsed
and
compelled
to
retire
but
only
to
for
a
fresh
assault
both
belgian
and
german
aeroplanes
flew
overhead
to
signal
their
respective
gunners
a
zeppelin
was
observed
but
did
not
come
within
range
of
belgian
fire
the
belgians
claim
to
have
shot
down
one
german
aeroplane
and
another
is
said
to
have
been
brought
to
earth
by
flying
within

of
its
own
artillery
during
the
morning
of
august
fort
fleron
was
put
out
of
action
by

destruction
of
its
machinery
this
proved
a
weak
point

it
was
presently
discovered
that
the
fire
of
the
supporting
forts
evegnée
and
chaudfontaine
could
not
command
the
lines
forming
the
apex
of
their
triangle
further
since
the
belgian
infantry
was
not
in
sufficient
force
to
hold
the
lines
between
the
forts
a
railway
into
liege
fell
to
the
enemy
the
fighting
here
was
of
such
a
desperate
nature
that
general
leman
hastened
to
reenforce
with
all
his
reserve
this
battle
went
on
during
the
afternoon
and
night
of
august
into
the
morning
of
august
but
the
fall
of
fort
fleron
began
to
tell
in
favor
of
the
germans
belgian
resistance
perforce
weakened
the
ceaseless
pounding
of
the
german
howitzers
smashed
the
inner
concrete
and

of
the

as
if
of

more

than

at

on

chaudfontaine

barchon
fell
under
the
terrific
hail
of
german
shells
a
way
was
now
opened
into
the
city
though
for
the
most
part
still
contested
by
belgian
infantry
a
party
of
german
hussars
availed
themselves
of
some
unguarded
path
to
make
a
daring
but
ineffectual
dash
to
capture
general
leman
and
his
staff
general
leman
was
consulting
with
his
officers
at
military
headquarters
on
august
when
they
were
startled
by
shouts
outside
he
rushed
forth
into
a
crowd
of
citizens
to
encounter
eight
men
in
german
uniform
general
leman
cried
for
a
revolver
to
defend
himself
but
another
officer
fearing
the
germans
had
entered
the
city
in
force
lifted
him
up
over
a
foundry
wall
both
leman
and
the
officer
made
their
escape
by
way
of
an
adjacent
house
belgian
civic
guards
hastening
to
the
scene
dispatched
an
officer
and
two
men
of
the
german
raiders
the
rest
of
the
party
are
said
to
have
been
made
prisoners
the
end
being
merely
a
question
of
hours
general
leman
ordered
the
evacuation
of
the
city
by
the
infantry
he
wisely
decided
it
could
be
of
more
service
to
the
belgian
army
at
dyle
than
held
in
a
beleaguered
and
doomed
city
reports
indicate
that
this
retreat
though
successfully
performed
was
precipitate
the
passage
of
it
was
scattered
with
arms
equipment
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
an
ambulance
train
was
abandoned
twenty
locomotives
left
in
the
railway
station
and
but
one
bridge
destroyed
in
rear
beyond
immediate
repair
after
its
accomplishment
general
leman
took
command
of
the
northern
forts
determined
to
hold
them
against
von
kluck
until
the
last
belgian
gun
was
silenced
early
on
august
burgomaster
kleyer
and
the
bishop
of
liege
negotiated
terms
for
the
surrender
of
the
city
it
had
suffered
but
slight
damage
from
the
bombardment
few
of
the
citizens
were
reported
among
the
killed
or
injured
on
behalf
of
the
germans
it
must
be
said
their
occupation
of
liege
was
performed
in
good
order
with
military
discipline
excellently
maintained
they
behaved
with
consideration
toward
the
inhabitants
in
establishing
their
rule
in
the
city
and
paid
for
all
supplies
requisitioned
they
were
quartered
in
various
public
buildings
and
institutions
probably
to
the
number
of
the
german
troops
at
first
seemed
to
present
an
interesting
spectacle
they
were
mostly
young
men
reported
as
footsore
from
their
long
march
in
new
imperfectly
fitting
boots
and
hungry
from
the
lack
of
accompanying
commissariat
this
is
proof
that
the
german
military
machine
did
not
work
to
perfection
at
the
outset
later
some
hostile
acts
by
belgian
individuals
moved
the
german
military
authorities
to
seize
a
group
of
the
principal
citizens
and
warn
the
inhabitants
that
the
breaking
of
a
peaceful
attitude
would
be
at
the
risk
of
swiftly
serious
punishment
precautions
to
enforce
order
were
such
as
is
provided
in
martial
law
and
carried
out
with
as
little
hardship
as
possible
to
the
citizens
the
germans
appeared
anxious
to
restore
confidence
and
win
a
feeling
of
good
will
for
some
days
after
the
capitulation
of
the
city
the
northern
forts
continued
a
heroic
resistance
so
long
as
these
remained
uncaptured
general
leman
maintained
that
strategically
liege
had
not
fallen
he
thus
held
in
check
the
armies
of
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
when
every
hour
was
of
supreme
urgency
for
their
respective
onsweep
into
central
belgium
and
up
the
meuse
valley
the
germans
presently
brought
into
an
overpowering
bombardment
their
siege
guns
on
august
embourg
was
stricken
into
ruin
on
the
same
day
the
electric
lighting
apparatus
of
fort
boncelles
having
been
destroyed
the
few
living
men
of
its
garrison
fought
through
the
following
night
in
darkness
and
in
momentary
danger
of
suffocation
from
gases
emitted
by
the
exploding
german
shells
early
in
the
morning
of
august
though
its
cupolas
were
battered
in
and
shells
rained
upon
the
interior
the
commander
refused
an
offer
of
surrender
a
little
later
the
concrete
inner
chamber
walls
fell
in
the
commander
of
boncelles
having
exhausted
his
defensive
hoisted
the
white
flag
he
had
held
out
for
eleven
days
in
a
veritable
inferno
fort
loncin
disputed
with
boncelles
the
honor
of
being
the
last
to
succumb
the
experience
of
its
garrison
differed
only
in
terrible
details
from
boncelles
its
final
gun
shot
was
fired
by
a
man
with
his
left
hand
since
the
other
had
been
severed
apparently
a
shell
exploded
in
its
magazine
and
blew
up
the
whole
fort
general
leman
was
discovered
amid
its
débris
pinned
beneath
a
huge
beam
he
was
released
by
his
own
men
when
taken
to
a
trench
a
german
officer
found
that
he
was
merely
unconscious
from
shock
when
sufficiently
recovered
general
leman
was
conducted
to
general
von
emmich
to
tender
his
personal
surrender
the
two
had
previously
been
comrades
at

of
their
meeting

by

chapter
iii
belgium
defiance
a
view
of
the
general
situation
in
belgium
will
assist
in
clearing
the
way
for
swiftly
following
events
germany
had
invaded
belgium
against
the
diplomatic
and
active
protests
of
its
government
but
the
german
government
still
hoped
that
the
heroic
resistance
of
liege
would
satisfy
belgian
national
spirit
and
a
free
passage
of
german
troops
now
be
granted
the
german
emperor
made
a
direct
appeal
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
through
the
medium
of
the
queen
of
holland
from
the
german
point
of
outlook
their
victory
could
best
be
attained
by
the
march
through
belgium
upon
paris
the
german
government
asserted
that
the
french
and
british
contemplated
a
similar
breach
of
belgian
neutrality
to
their
mind
it
was
a
case
of
which
should
be
on
the
ground
first
on
the
other
hand
the
allies
pronounced
the
german
invasion
of
belgium
an
unprovoked
assault
and
produced
countertestimony
the
controversy
has
continued
to
this
day
but
the
war
as
it
progressed
has
seen
many
breaches
of
neutrality
and
a
certain
resignation
to
the
inevitable
has
succeeded
the
moral
indignation
so
easily
aroused
in
its
early
stages
let
us
now
glance
at
the
condition
of
belgium
when
war
was
declared
the
belgians
were
an
industrial
and
not
a
militant
people
they
had
ample
reason
to
yearn
for
a
permanent
peace
their
country
had
been
the
cockpit
of
europe
from
the
time
of
cæsar
until
waterloo
the
names
of
their
cities
for
the
most
part
represented
great
historic
battle
fields
again
and
again
had
the
ruin
of
conflict
swept
over
their
unfortunately
situated
land
at
all
periods
the
belgians
were
brave
fighters
on
one
side
or
the
other
for
belgium
had
been
denied
a
national
unity
doubtless
therefore
they
welcomed
the
establishment
of
their
independent
sovereignty
and
the
era
of
peace
which
followed
historically
they
had
suffered
enough
with
an
abundance
to
spare
from
perpetual
warfare
their
minds
turned
hopefully
toward
industrial
and
commercial
activity
stimulated
by
the
natural
mineral
wealth
of
their
soil
thus
the
products
of
their
factories
reached
all
countries
south
america
china
manchuria
and
central
africa
especially
of
later
years
where
a
great
territory
had
been
acquired
in
the
congo
the
iron
and
steel
work
of
liege
was
famous
antwerp
had
become
one
of
the
chief
ports
of
europe
and
growing
into
a
financial
power
but
owing
to
the
confined
boundaries
of
belgium
there
grew
to
be
a
congestion
of
population
this
produced
a
strong
democratic
and
socialistic
uplift
which
even
threatened
the
existence
of
the
monarchy
also
all
that
monarchy
seemed
to
imply
the
belgians
doubtless
with
memories
of
the
past
despised
and
hated
the
display
of
military
consequently
it
was
only
with
difficulty
and
in
the
face
of
popular
opposition
that
the
belgium
government
had
succeeded
with
military
plans
for
defense
but
imperfectly
carried
out
herein
perhaps
we
have
the
keynote
to
desperate
resistance
to
the
german
invaders
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
it
is
easily
conceivable
that
the
germans
represented
to
the
belgians
the
military
yoke
they
were
determined
to
have
none
of
it
upon
any
overtures
or
terms
but
they
relied
on
france
and
england
for
protection
when
common
prudence
should
have
made
the
mobilization
of
an
army
of
men
ready
for
the
call
to
repel
an
invader
on
either
of
the
frontiers
instead
of
the
practically
helpless
force
of
the
german
general
staff
did
not
believe
the
belgians
intended
to
raise
a
serious
barrier
in
their
path
but
with
the
crisis
democratic
belgium
united
in
a
rush
to
arms
which
recalls
similar
action
by
the
american
colonists
at
the
revolution
every
form
of
weapon
was
grasped
from
old
muskets
to
pitchforks
and
shearing
knives
it
was
remarked
by
a
foreign
witness
that
in
default
of
properly
equipped
armories
the
belgians
emptied
the
museums
to
confront
the
germans
with
the
strangest
assortment
of
antiquated
military
tools
as
testimony
of
belgian
feeling
the
labor
party
organ
le
peuple
issued
the
following
trumpet
blast
why
do
we
as
irreconcilable
antimilitarists
cry
from
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
to
all
those
who
offer
themselves
for
the
defense
of
the
country
because
it
is
not
only
necessary
to
protect
the
hearths
and
homes
the
women
and
the
children
but
it
is
also
necessary
to
protect
at
the
price
of
our
blood
the
heritage
of
our
ancient
freedom
go
then
sons
of
the
workers
and
register
your
names
as
recruits
we
will
rather
die
for
the
idea
of
progress
and
solidarity
of
humanity
than
live
under
a
régime
whose
brutal
force
and
savage
violence
have
wiped
outright
the
belgian
general
staff
foreseeing
dire
consequences
from
such
inflaming
press
utterances
warned
all
those
not
regularly
enlisted
to
maintain
a
peaceful
attitude
disregard
of
this
admonition
later
met
with
heavy
retribution
on
wednesday
august
a
german
cavalry
screen
thrown
in
advance
of
the
main
forces
came
in
touch
with
belgian
patrols
a
series
of
engagements
took
place
the
germans
tried
to
seize
the
bridges
across
the
dyle
at
haelen
and
at
cortenachen
on
the
velpe
a
tributary
of
the
former
river
mainly
with
the
object
of
outflanking
the
belgian
left
wing
the
belgians
are
said
to
have
numbered
some
of
all
arms
and
were
successful
in
repulsing
the
germans
on
august
similar
actions
were
continued
at
tirlemont
german
cavalry
swept
upon
the
town
but
were
beaten
off
at
eghezee
on
the
extreme
belgian
right
close
to
namur
and
the
historic
field
of
ramillies
another
brush
with
the
germans
took
place
belgian
cavalry
caught
a
german
cavalry
detachment
bivouacked
in
the
village
sharp
fighting
through
the
streets
ensued
before
the
germans
withdrew
in
spite
of
the
warning
of
the
belgian
general
staff
and
similar
advance
german
notices
the
citizens
of
some
of
these
and
other
places
began
sniping
german
patrols
meantime
moving
over
the
roads
toward
namur
toiled
the
huge
german
guns
the
german
general
staff
had
taken
to
mind
the
lesson
of
liege
each
gun
was
transported
in
several
parts
hauled
by
traction
engines
and
forty
horses
of
this
with
the
advance
of
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
the
belgian
general
staff
was
kept
in
total
ignorance
by
the
german
screen
of
cavalry
so
ably
was
this
screen
work
performed
that
the
belgians
were
led
to
believe
the
germans
had
succeeded
in
placing
no
more
than
two
divisions
of
cavalry
together
with
a
few
detachments
of
infantry
and
artillery
on
belgian
soil
they
in
fact
regarded
the
german
cavalry
skirmishing
as
a
rather
clumsy
offensive
as
we
have
seen
the
resistance
of
forts
boncelles
and
loncin
at
liege
held
back
the
main
german
advance
from
seven
to
ten
days
their
fall
released
into
german
control
the
railway
junction
at
ans
with
that
was
included
the
line
from
liege
up
the
left
bank
of
the
meuse
to
namur
also
another
line
direct
to
brussels
on
august
the
cavalry
screen
was
withdrawn
and
four
german
army
corps
were
revealed
to
the
surprised
belgian
line
in
this
emergency
clearly
their
only
hope
lay
with
the
french
in
louvain
brussels
and
antwerp
anxious
questions
lay
on
all
lips
why
do
not
the
french
hasten
to
our
aid
when
will
they
come
will
the
british
fail
us
at
the
twelfth
hour
eager
watchers
at
ostend
beheld
no
sign
of
the
promised
transports
to
disembark
a
british
army
of
support
in
the
day
of
overwhelming
need
about
this
time
some
french
cavalry
crossed
the
sambre
to
join
hands
with
the
belgian
right
wing
near
waterloo
but
it
was
little
more
than
a
detachment
the
french
general
staff
was
occupied
with
a
realignment
and
had
decided
not
to
advance
into
belgium
until
they
could
do
so
in
force
sufficient
to
cope
with
the
germans
the
belgian
general
staff
saw
there
was
no
other
course
but
to
fall
back
fighting
actions
until
the
french
army
was
heralded
by
the
thunder
of
friendly
guns
the
belgian
army
was
thus
withdrawn
from
the
river
gethe
to
hold
aerschot
on
its
left
stubbornly
through
august
diest
trond
and
waremme
fell
before
the
german
tidal
wave
without
resistance
von
kluck
main
army
endeavored
to
sweep
around
the
belgian
right
at
wavre
but
was
checked
for
a
brief
space
chapter
iv
capture
of
louvain
surrender
of
brussels
during
august
the
german
center
was
hurled
forward
in
irresistible
strength
the
citizens
of
the
villages
in
its
path
fled
precipitously
along
the
roads
to
brussels
at
intersections
all
kinds
of
vehicles
bearing
household
effects
together
with
live
stock
blocked
the
way
to
safety
the
uhlan
had
become
a
terror
but
not
without
some
provocation
tirlemont
was
bombarded
reduced
and
evacuated
by
the
belgian
troops
the
latter
made
a
vigorous
defensive
immediately
before
louvain
but
their
weakness
in
artillery
and
numbers
could
not
withstand
the
overwhelming
superiority
of
the
germans
they
were
thrust
back
from
the
valley
of
the
dyle
to
begin
their
retreat
on
antwerp
chiefly
by
way
of
malines
this
was
to
elude
a
successful
german
envelopment
on
their
louvain
right
they
retired
in
good
order
but
their
losses
had
been
considerable
this
body
was
the
belgian
right
wing
which
fell
back
to
take
up
a
position
before
louvain
here
it
fought
a
action
on
august
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
main
army
by
way
of
malines
on
antwerp
the
belgian
right
wing
thus
became
a
rear
guard
it
withstood
the
german
attack
until
the
early
morning
of
august
when
separated
from
the
main
body
the
overpowering
number
of
german
guns
and
men
drove
it
back
to
a
final
stand
between
louvain
and
brussels
if
its
losses
had
been
heavy
the
carrying
away
of
the
wounded
proved
that
it
still
maintained
a
fighting
front
the
retreat
of
the
main
army
on
antwerp
was
part
of
plan
for
the
defense
of
belgium
since
the
position
of
brussels
was
not
capable
of
a
strong
defense
by
this
time
the
main
army
was
safely
passing
down
the
valley
of
the
dyle
to
the
shelter
of
the
antwerp
forts
leaving
the
right
wing
to
its
fate
louvain
thus
fell
to
the
germans
toward
noon
of
august
the
burgomaster
and
four
sheriffs
awaited
at
one
of
the
city
gates
the
first
german
appearance
this
proved
to
be
a
party
of
hussars
bearing
a
white
flag
they
conducted
the
burgomaster
to
the
waiting
generals
at
the
head
of
the
advance
column
in
token
of
surrender
the
burgomaster
was
requested
to
remove
his
scarf
of
office
displaying
the
belgian
national
colors
the
german
terms
were
then
pronounced
a
free
passage
of
troops
through
the
city
was
to
be
granted
and
men
garrisoned
in
its
barracks
in
return
cash
was
to
be
paid
for
all
supplies
requisitioned
and
a
guarantee
given
for
the
lives
and
property
of
the
inhabitants
the
germans
further
agreed
to
maintain
the
established
civil
power
but
warned
that
hostile
acts
by
civilians
would
be
severely
punished
these
terms
were
in
general
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
war
governing
the
military
occupation
of
an
enemy
city
in
this
respect
emphasis
should
be
laid
on
the
fact
that
under
these
rules
the
hostile
act
of
any
civilian
places
him
in
the
same
position
as
a
spy
his
recognized
sentence
is
death
by
the
germans
entered
louvain
with
bands
playing
and
singing
in
a
great
swelling
chorus
die
wacht
am
rhein
and
hail
to
the
war
lord
they
marched
to
quick
time
but
in
passing
through
the
great
square
of
the
gare
du
nord
broke
into
the
parade
goose
step
in
the
van
were
such
famous
regiments
as
the
death
head
and
zeiten
hussars
the
infantry
wore
heavy
boots
which
falling
in
unison
struck
the
earth
with
resounding
blows
to
echo
back
from
the
house
walls
thus
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
poured
through
louvain
in
a
surge
of
hitherto
unimagined
military
might
this
for
the
latter
part
of
the
and
the
day
following
at
first
the
citizens
looked
on
from
the
sidewalks
in
a
spellbound
silence
scarcely
one
seemed
to
possess
the
incentive
to
breathe
a
whisper
only
the
babies
and
very
small
children
regarded
the
spectacle
as
something
provided
by
way
of
entertainment
for
the
rest
of
the
citizens
it
was
dumbfounding
beyond
human
comprehension
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
rolled
on
unceasingly
to
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
the
tramp
of
feet
the
rumble
of
guns
and
that
triumphant
mighty
chorus
there
was
nothing
of
aforetime
plumed
and
splendor
of
war
about
it
but
the
modern
teutonic
arms
on
grim
business
bent
except
for
a
curious
glance
bestowed
here
and
there
the
german
troops
marched
with
eyes
front
and
a
precision
as
if
being
reviewed
by
the
emperor
a
few
shots
were
heard
to
stir
instant
terror
among
the
citizen
onlookers
but
these
were
between
the
german
advance
guard
and
belgian
stragglers
left
behind
in
the
city
presently
the
side
streets
became
dangerous
to
pedestrians
from
onrushing
automobiles
containing
staff
officers
and
motor
wagons
of
the
military
train
general
von
arnim
in
command
ordered
the
hauling
down
of
all
allied
colors
but
permitted
the
belgian
flag
to
remain
flying
above
the
hôtel
de
ville
he
promptly
issued
a
proclamation
warning
all
citizens
to
preserve
the
peace
it
was
both
placarded
and
announced
verbally
the
latter
was
performed
by
a
minor
city
official
ringing
a
bell
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
accompanied
by
policemen
toward
evening
of
august
the
cafés
and
restaurants
filled
up
with
hungry
german
officers
and
men
every
hotel
room
was
occupied
and
provision
shops
speedily
sold
out
the
stores
on
their
shelves
the
germans
paid
in
cash
for
everything
ordered
and
preserved
a
careful
attitude
of
nonaggression
toward
the
citizens
but
subconsciously
there
ran
an
undercurrent
of
dread
insecurity
at
the
outset
a
german
officer
was
said
to
have
been
struck
by
a
bullet
somewhat
conspicuously
the
wounded
officer
was
borne
on
a
litter
through
the
streets
followed
by
the
dead
body
of
his
assailant
very
promptly
a
news
curtain
was
drawn
down
around
the
city
cutting
it
off
from
all
information
of
the
world
without
artillery
fire
was
heard
presumably
this
came
from
the
last
stand
of
the
belgian
rear
guard
in
a
valley
of
the
hilly
country
between
louvain
and
brussels
with
sustained
optimism
to
the
end
rumor
had
it
that
the
artillery
fire
was
that
of
french
and
british
guns
coming
to
the
relief
of
louvain
toward
nightfall
one
or
two
groups
of
snipers
were
brought
in
from
the
suburbs
and
marched
to
the
place
of
execution
the
feeling
of
a
threatened
calamity
deepened
another
warning
proclamation
was
issued
ordering
all
citizens
to
give
up
their
arms
further
everyone
was
ordered
to
bed
at
eight
all
windows
were
to
be
closed
and
all
doors
unlocked
a
burning
lamp
was
to
be
placed
in
each
window
on
the
claim
that
german
soldiers
had
been
killed
by
citizens
the
burgomaster
and
several
of
the
city
officials
were
secured
as
hostages
a
stern
proclamation
was
issued
threatening
with
immediate
execution
every
citizen
found
with
a
weapon
in
his
possession
or
house
every
house
from
which
a
shot
was
fired
would
be
burned
this
was
on
august
by
the
evening
of
that
day
the
german
army
had
passed
through
louvain
estimated
to
the
number
of
men
only
the
garrison
remained
in
the
city
outwardly
the
citizens
resumed
their
usual
daily
affairs
as
if
with
a
sense
of
relief
but
whispers
dropped
now
and
then
revealed
an
abiding
terror
beneath
some
time
during
the
next
day
or
two
the
anticipated
calamity
fell
upon
louvain
the
german
officers
insisted
that
sniping
was
steadily
going
on
and
the
military
authorities
put
into
force
their
threatened
reprisal
the
torch
or
rather
incendiary
tablets
were
thrown
into
convicted
houses
larger
groups
of
citizens
were
led
to
execution
thereupon
the
brute
passion
dormant
in
soldiers
broke
the
bonds
of
discipline
flames
burst
forth
everywhere
beneath
the
lurid
glow
cast
upon
the
sky
above
louvain
whole
streets
stood
out
in
blackened
ruin
and
those
architectural
treasures
of
the
halles
and
the
university
with
its
famous
library
were
destroyed
beyond
hope
of
repair
only
the
walls
of
peter
church
containing
many
priceless
paintings
remained
meanwhile
on
the
morning
of
august
the
german
army
had
swept
away
the
comparatively
small
belgian
rearguard
force
before
brussels
and
advanced
upon
the
capital
on
the
previous
the
king
of
the
belgians
removed
his
government
to
antwerp
the
diplomatic
corps
followed
mr
brand
whitlock
the
american
minister
however
remained
in
his
capacity
as
a
neutral
he
had
assisted
stranded
germans
in
brussels
from
hasty
official
and
mob
peril
he
stayed
to
perform
a
similar
service
for
the
belgians
and
allies
his
success
in
these
efforts
won
for
him
german
respect
and
the
gratitude
of
the
whole
belgian
nation
a
lingering
plan
for
defending
brussels
by
throwing
up
barricades
and
constructing
wire
entanglements
to
be
manned
by
the
civic
guard
was
abandoned
in
the
face
of
wiser
counsel
it
would
merely
have
resulted
in
a
bombardment
with
needless
destruction
of
life
and
property
brussels
was
defenseless
in
flight
before
the
german
host
refugees
of
all
classes
were
streaming
into
brussels
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
priest
and
layman
nearly
all
bore
some
burden
of
household
treasure
many
some
pathetically
absurd
family
heirloom
every
kind
of
vehicle
appeared
to
have
been
called
into
use
from
smart
carriages
drawn
by
heavy
flemish
horses
to
little
carts
harnessed
to
dogs
over
all
reigned
a
stupefied
silence
broken
only
by
shuffling
footfalls
among
them
the
absence
of
automobiles
and
light
horses
would
indicate
all
such
had
been
commandeered
by
the
belgian
military
authorities
their
cavalry
was
badly
in
need
of
good
mounts
at
crossroads
passage
to
imagined
safety
was
blocked
by
farm
live
stock
driven
by
bewildered
peasants
on
thursday
morning
august
the
burgomaster
motored
forth
to
meet
the
germans
his
reception
and
the
terms
dictated
by
general
von
arnim
were
almost
identically
the
same
as
at
louvain
the
burgomaster
was
perforce
compelled
to
accept
the
scene
of
the
entry
of
the
german
troops
into
louvain
was
repeated
at
brussels
there
was
the
same
stolidly
gathering
of
onlookers
on
the
sidewalks
the
same
thundering
triumphant
march
of
the
german
host
corps
after
corps
probably
of
those
who
had
fought
at
liege
and
subsequently
passed
around
the
city
on
the
grand
sweep
toward
the
french
frontier
moreover
huge
bodies
of
german
troops
were
advancing
up
the
valley
of
the
meuse
and
through
the
woods
of
the
ardennes
as
in
louvain
that
night
the
hotels
restaurants
cafes
and
shops
of
brussels
were
patronized
by
a
rush
of
trade
which
never
before
totaled
such
extent
in
a
single
day
bills
of
purchase
were
settled
by
the
germans
in
cash
the
city
was
promptly
assessed
a
war
indemnity
of
with
the
fall
of
brussels
the
first
objective
of
the
germans
may
be
said
to
have
been
gained
but
the
right
wing
of
von
army
was
still
operating
northward
upon
antwerp
the
belgian
army
had
escaped
him
within
the
circle
of
antwerp
forts
so
that
he
detailed
a
force
deemed
to
be
sufficient
to
hold
the
enemy
secure
then
he
struck
eastward
between
antwerp
and
brussels
at
alost
ghent
and
bruges
in
his
advance
he
swept
several
divisions
of
cavalry
also
motor
cars
bearing
machine
guns
beyond
bruges
his
patrol
caught
their
first
glimpse
of
the
north
sea
drawing
in
toward
another
goal
on
the
english
channel
but
the
belgian
army
within
security
of
antwerp
had
not
been
routed
it
had
retreated
in
good
order
thanks
to
the
resistance
of
its
rear
guard
general
de
moranville
promptly
reenforced
it
with
new
volunteers
to
the
extent
of
some
men
in
addition
he
drew
upon
a
fresh
supply
of
ammunition
and
new
artillery
well
horsed
his
cavalry
however
were
certainly
no
better
and
probably
worse
than
that
with
which
his
army
had
been
complemented
originally
on
august
obtaining
information
that
the
germans
were
in
considerably
inferior
force
at
malines
the
belgians
began
a
vigorous
counteroffensive
general
de
moranville
drove
the
germans
out
of
malines
on
the
day
following
that
was
in
the
nature
of
a
master
stroke
for
it
gave
the
belgians
control
of
the
shortest
railway
from
germany
into
west
flanders
further
since
von
kluck
had
reached
bruges
and
reenforcements
under
general
von
boehn
had
passed
across
the
belgian
direct
line
on
brussels
the
great
german
right
wing
was
in
danger
of
being
caught
in
a
trap
von
boehn
therefore
was
hurriedly
detached
rearward
to
deal
with
the
belgian
counteroffensive
but
this
deprived
von
kluck
of
his
needed
reenforcements
to
overcome
british
marines
landed
at
ostend
that
together
with
the
civic
guard
had
beaten
back
german
patrols
from
the
place
had
the
british
now
landed
an
army
at
ostend
von
kluck
between
the
belgian
and
british
forces
would
have
been
in
serious
danger
of
annihilation
with
the
german
right
wing
thus
crumpled
the
whole
of
their
offensive
would
have
broken
down
but
the
british
did
not
come
and
so
the
belgians
were
left
to
fight
it
out
single
handed
this
fighting
went
on
for
three
weeks
with
accurate
details
lacking
mainly
it
was
upon
the
line
with
antwerp
for
the
belgian
base
on
august
a
german
zeppelin
sailed
over
antwerp
and
dropped
a
number
of
bombs
the
belgians
thrust
their
right
wing
forward
and
recaptured
alost
they
advanced
their
center
to
a
siege
of
cortenburg
malines
seemed
secure
to
the
belgians
this
was
a
historic
triumph
famous
for
its
manufacture
of
lace
under
the
name
of

almost
every

contained
some

von

was
heavily
reenforced
with
the
third
army
corps
reserves
from
the
south
and
sailors
and
marines
his
army
was
now
between
and

this
placed
overwhelming
odds
against
the
belgians
but
for
four
days
they
fought
a
stubborn
battle
at
weerde
this
was
from
september
to
and
resulted
in
the
capture
of
the

by
the
germans
the
belgians
had
now
fought
to
the
extremity
of
what
could
be
expected
without

from

action
left
for

v
coming
of

we
now
come
to
the
arrival
of
the
british
on
the
continent
in
using
the
term
british
it
is
expressly
intended
to
comprise
the
united
forces
of
the
british
isles
on
august
the
british
government
practically
gave
up
hope
that
war
with
germany
could
be
avoided
though
it
would
appear
to
have
lingered
until
the
ultimatum
to
germany
to
vacate
belgian
soil
remained
unanswered
on
that
day
the
army
was
mobilized
at
aldershot
on
august
lord
kitchener
was
recalled
at
the
outset
from
a
journey
to
egypt
and
appointed
minister
of
war
no
more
fortunate
selection
than
this
could
have
been
made
above
all
else
lord
kitchener
reputation
had
been
won
as
an
able
transport
officer
in
the
emergency
as
minister
of

the
responsibility
for
the
transport
of
a
british
army
oversea
rested
in
his
hands
on
august
the
house
of
commons
voted
a
credit
of
and
an
increase
of
men
to
the
regular
forces
upon
the
same
day
preparations
went
forward
for
the
dispatch
of
an
expeditionary
army
to
france
the
decision
to
send
the
army
to
france
instead
of
direct
to
a
landing
in
belgium
would
seem
to
have
been
in
response
to
an
urgent
french
entreaty
that
great
britain
mark
visibly
on
french
soil
her
unity
with
that
nation
at
the
supreme
crisis
for
some
days
previously
british
reluctance
to
enter
the
war
while
a
gleam
of
hope
remained
to
confine
if
not
prevent
the
european
conflagration
had
created
a
feeling
of
disappointment
in
france
the
british

consisted
at

great
no
one
at
the
beginning
of
the

realized
his
capabilities
for
the
developing
scope
of
the
task
untried
but
as
a
serious
and
courageous
officer
he
fully
merited
the
honors
he
had
already
won
by
august
admiral
jellicoe
was
able
to
guarantee
a
safe
passage
for
the
british
army
across
the
english
channel
a
fortunate
mobilization
of
the
british
grand
fleet
in
the
north
sea
for
maneuvers
shut
off
the
german
grand
fleet
from
raiding
the
channel
there
was
nothing
to
criticize
in
the
manner
in
which
the
expeditionary
army
was
thrown
into
france
its
equipment
was
ready
and
in
all
details
fully
worthy
of
german
military
organization
from
arms
to
boots
the
latter
not
long
since
a
scandal
of
shoddy
workmanship
only
the
best
material
and
skill
had
been
accepted
its
transport
proved
the
genius
of
lord
kitchener
in
that
brand
of
military
service
the
railways
leading
to
the
ports
of
embarkation
together
with
passenger
steamships
some
of
them
familiar
in

were
commandeered
as

of

steamed
toward
southampton
and
some
other

complements
were
also
embarked
at
dublin
avonmouth
and
the
bristol
channel
in
the
middle
of
the
night
citizens
of
small
towns
along
the
route
were
awakened
by
the
unceasing
rumble
of
trains
they
had
no
conception
of
its
import
they
did
not
even
realize
that
war
had
actually
burst
upon
the
serenity
of
their
peaceful
lives
each
transport
vessel
was
placed
in
command
of
a
naval
officer
and
guarded
in
its
passage
across
the
channel
by
light
cruisers
and
torpedo
destroyers
the
transport
of
the
whole
expeditionary
army
was
completed
within
ten
days
without
the
loss
of
a
man
and
with
a
precision
worthy
of
all
military
commendation
but
such
secrecy
was
maintained
that
the
british
public
remained
in
ignorance
of
its
passage
until
successfully
accomplished
american
correspondents
however
were
not
yet
strictly
censored
so
that
their
papers
published
news
of
it
on
august
on
sunday
august
two
british
transports
were
observed
making
for
the
harbor
of
boulogne
the
weather
was
all
that
could
be
wished
the
crossing
resembled
a
excursion
for
some
days
previously
the
french
had
taken
a
gloomy
view
of
british
support
but
french
fishermen
returning
from
scotland
and
english
ports
maintained
confidence
for
had
not
british
fishermen
told
them
the
french
would
never
be
abandoned
to
fall
a
prey
to
the
enemy
when
the
two
advance
british
transports
steamed
into
view
les
anglais
at
last
everyone
cried
at
once
a
hugely
joyful
reversion
of
feeling
the
landing
of
the
british
soldiers
was
made
a
popular
ovation
their
appearance
soldierly
bearing
their
gentleness
toward
women
and
children
their
care
of
the
horses
were
showered
with
heartfelt
french
compliments
especially
the
scotch
highlanders
after
their
cautious
fashion
wondered
at
the
exuberance
of
their
welcome
for
the
brave
irish
was
not
marshal
macmahon
of
descent
and
the
first
president
of
the
third
republic
the
irish
alone
would
save
that
republic
women
begged
for
the
regimental
badges
to
pin
on
their
breasts
in
turn
they
offered
delicacies
of
all
kinds
to
the
soldiers
for
the
first
time
in
a
hundred
years
the
british
uniform
was
seen
on
french
soil
then
it
represented
an
enemy
now
a
comrade
in
arms
the
bond
of
union
was
sealed
at
a
midnight
military
mass
celebrated
by
priests
for
british

french
catholic
soldiers
at

meanwhile
officers
of
the
french

had
journeyed
to
london
to
confer
with
the
british
general
staff
regarding
the
camping
and
alignment
of
the
british
troops
meanwhile
also
the
british

were
called
to
the
colors
the
latter
comprised
the
militia
infantry
and
artillery
and
the
volunteer
yeomanry
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
the
militia
was
the
oldest
british
military
force
officered
to
a
great
extent
by
retired
regular
army
men
its
permanent
staffs
of
noncommissioned
officers
were
from

and
it
was
under
the
direct
control
of
the
secretary
of

for

the
volunteer
infantry
artillery
and
yeomanry
cavalry
were
on
a
somewhat
different
basis
more
nearly
resembling
the
american
militia
but
the
british
militia
were
linked
with
battalions
the
reserves
militia
and
volunteers
added
approximately
men
for
immediate
home
defense
on
sunday
august
it
was
officially
announced
that
the
whole
of
the
british
expeditionary
army
had
landed
in
france
conferences
between
the
british
and
french
general
staffs
resulted
in
the
british
army
being
concentrated
first
at
amiens
from
that
point
it
was
to
advance
into
position
as
the
left
wing
of
the
united
french
and
british
armies
though
controlled
by
their
separate
commanders
the
french
fifth
army
had
already
moved
to
hold
the
line
of
the
river
sambre
with
its
right
in
touch
with
namur
cavalry
patrols
had
been
thrown
forward
to
ligny
and
gembloux
where
they
skirmished
with
uhlans
charleroi
was
made
french
headquarters
it
was
the
center
of
extensive
and
steel
industry
pit
shafts
and
blast
furnaces
dominated
the
landscape
historically
it
was
the
ground
over
which
blücher
fourth
army
corps
marched
to
the
support
of
the
british
at
waterloo
now
the
british
were
supporting
the
french
upon
it
against
their
former
ally
on
thursday
august
the
british
took
up
their
position
on
the
french
left
their
line
ran
from
binche
to
mons
then
within
the
french
frontier
stretched
westward
to
condé
from
mons
to
condé
it
followed
the
line
of
the
canal
thus
occupying
an
already
constructed
barrier
formerly
condé
was
regarded
as
a
fortress
of
formidable
strength
but
its
position
was
not
held
to
be
of
value
in
modern
strategy
its
forts
therefore
had
been
dismantled
of
guns
and
its
works
permitted
to
fall
into
disuse
but
the
fortress
of
maubeuge
lay
immediately
in
rear
of
the
british
line
in
rear
again
general
sordet
held
a
french
cavalry
corps
for
flank
actions
in
front
across
the
belgian
frontier
general
lay
with
a
french
brigade
at
tournai
as
an
outpost
before
proceeding
to
british
headquarters
general
french
held
a
conference
with
general
joffre
commander
in
chief
of
all
the
french
armies
until
the
outbreak
of
the
war
general
joffre
was
practically
unknown
to
the
french
people
he
was
no
popular
military
idol
no
boulevard
dashing
figure
but
he
had
seen
active
service
with
credit
and
had
climbed
step
by
step
with
persevering
study
of
military
science
into
the
council
of
the
french
general
staff
as
a
strategist
his
qualities
came
to
be
recognized
as
paramount
in
that
body
a
few
years
previously
he
had
been
intrusted
with
the
reorganization
of
the
french
army
and
his
plans
accepted
therefore
when
war
with
germany
became
a
certainty
it
was
natural
the
supreme
command
of
the
french
army
should
fall
to
general
joffre
chapter
vi
campaigns
in
alsace
and
lorraine
the
french
staff
apparently
had
designed
a
campaign
in
upper
alsace
and
the
vosges
but
the
throwing
of
a
brigade
from
belfort
across
the
frontier
on
the
extreme
right
of
their
line
on
august
would
seem
to
have
been
undertaken
chiefly
with
a
view
of
rousing
patriotic
enthusiasm
french
aeroplane
scouts
had
brought
in
the
intelligence
that
only
small
bodies
of
german
troops
occupied
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
therefore
the
opportunity
was
presented
to
invade
the
upper
part
of
the
lost
province
of
alsace
a
dramatic
blow
calculated
to
arouse
the
french
patriotic
spirit
since
the
germans
had
expended
hardly
any
effort
in
its
defense
leaving
as
it
were
an
open
door
it
may
have
been
part
of
the
strategic
idea
of
their
general
staff
to
draw
a
french
army
into
that
region
with
the
design
of
inflicting
a
crushing
defeat
thus
french
resistance
in
the
southern
vosges
would
have
been
weakened
the
capture
of
belfort
unsupported
by
its
field
army
a
probability
and
a
drive
beyond
into
france
by
the
german
forces
concentrated
at
neubreisach
made
triumphant
doubtless
the
french
general
staff
fully
grasped
the
german
intention
but
considered
a
nibble
at
the
alluring
german
bait
of
some
value
for
its
sentimental
effect
upon
the
french
and
alsatians
otherwise
the
invasion
of
upper
alsace
with
a
brigade
was
doomed
at
the
outset
to
win
no
military
advantage
on
august
the
french
dispersed
a
german
outpost
intrenched
before
altkirch
some
cavalry
skirmishing
followed
which
resulted
in
the
french
gaining
possession
of
the
city
as
was
to
be
expected
the
citizens
of
altkirch
welcomed
the
french
with
enthusiasm
the
following
morning
the
french
were
permitted
an
uncontested
advance
to
mülhausen
that
such
an
important
manufacturing
center
as
mülhausen
should
have
remained
unfortified
within
striking
distance
of
the
french
frontier
that
the
french
entered
it
without
being
compelled
to
fire
a
shot
was
a
surprise
to
everyone
with
the
probable
exception
of
the
german
and
french
general
staffs
the
citizens
of
mülhausen
repeated
the
joyous
ovation
bestowed
on
the
french
troops
in
altkirch
the
french
uniform
was
hailed
as
the
visible
sign
of
deliverance
from
german
dominion
and
the
restoration
of
the
lost
province
to
their
kindred
of
the
neighboring
republic
the
climax
of
this
ebullition
was
reached
in
a
proclamation
issued
by
direction
of
general
joffre
people
of
alsace
it
ran
after
forty
years
of
weary
waiting
french
soldiers
again
tread
the
soil
of
your
native
country
they
are
the
pioneers
in
the
great
work
of
redemption
what
emotion
and
what
pride
for
them
to
complete
the
work
they
are
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
the
french
nation
with
one
heart
spurs
them
forward
and
on
the
folds
of
their
flag
are
inscribed
the
magical
names
liberty
and
right
long
live
france
long
live
alsace
during
august
some
intermittent
fighting
went
on
in
the
vicinity
of
mülhausen
which
seems
to
have
given
the
french
general
in
command
the
impression
that
the
germans
were
not
eager
for
a
counterattack
in
turn
the
germans
may
well
have
been
puzzled
that
a
french
brigade
instead
of
an
army
was
thrown
into
upper
alsace
for
the
bait
of
mülhausen
possibly
they
waited
a
little
for
the
main
body
which
did
not
come
sunday
august
revealed
the
germans
in
such
overpowering
strength
that
the
french
were
left
no
other
choice
than
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
they
accordingly
fell
back
upon
altkirch
to
intrench
a
few
miles
beyond
their
own
border
thus
ended
the
french
initial
offensive
in
military
reckoning
it
achieved
little
of
value
meanwhile
in
the
ardennes
on
august
the
german
crown
prince
commanding
the
fourth
army
advanced
from
luxemburg
into
the
southern
ardennes
and
captured
his
further
objective
was
to
break
through
the
french
line
somewhere
near
the
historic
ground
of
sedan
but
at
this
point
some
change
in
the
german
plan
seems
to
have
taken
place
from
the
maze
still
enveloping
the
opening
events
of
the
war
one
can
only
conjecture
a
reason
which
would
move
such
an
irrevocable
body
as
the
german
general
staff
to
alter
a
plan
probably
then
the
unanticipated
strength
of
belgian
resistance
foreshadowed
the
summoning
of
reenforcements
to
von
kluck
right
wing
of
the
whole
german
army
we
have
seen
in
fact
how
he
came
to
be
near
a
desperate
need
at
bruges
and
only
the
heavy
reenforcement
of
von
boehn
enabled
that
general
to
deliver
a
final
defeat
to
the
belgian
field
army
at
weerde
whatever
the
cause
of
change
of
plan
may
have
been
important
forces
attached
to
or
intended
for
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
the
crown
prince
were
withdrawn
to
support
the
armies
of
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
these
forces
went
to
form
a
unit
under
general
von
hausen
a
veteran
of
sadowa
this
change
left
the
saxon
army
of
the
crown
prince
with
hardly
sufficient
strength
for
a
main
attack
on
the
french
line
at
sedan
but
still
formidable
enough
to
feel
its
way
cautiously
through
the
ardennes
to
test
the
french
concentration
on
the
central
meuse
west
bank
when
the
german
right
had
finally
settled
liege
the
saxon
army
could
then
join
in
the
united
great
movement
on
paris
early
on
the
morning
of
august
a
french
detachment
of
half
an
infantry
regiment
thrown
into
dinant
was
surprised
by
a
mobile
saxon
advance
force
of
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
dinant
lies
across
the
meuse
eighteen
miles
south
of
namur
it
is
a
picturesque
ancient
town
the
haunt
of
artists
and
tourists
in
the
vicinity
are
the
estates
of
several
wealthy
belgian
families
particularly
the
château
of
walzin
once
the
stronghold
of
the
comtes
a
bridge
crosses
the
meuse
at
dinant
which
sits
mainly
on
the
east
bank
within
shadow
of
precipitous
limestone
cliffs
a
stone
fort
more
imposing
in
appearance
than
modern
effectiveness
crowns
the
highest
cliff
summit
overlooking
dinant
the
germans
came
by
way
of
the
east
bank
to
occupy
the
suburbs
they
presently
captured
the
fort
and
hoisted
the
german
flag
meanwhile
the
french
took
possession
of
the
bridge
being
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
from
german
rifle
fire
from
the
cliffs
the
solid
stone
abutments
of
the
bridge
however
enabled
the
french
to
hold
that
position
until
strong
reenforcements
arrived
early
in
the
afternoon
while
french
infantry
cleared
the
environs
of
germans
their
artillery
bombarded
the
fort
from
the
west
bank
their
shells
played
havoc
with
the
old
fort
defenses
soon
compelling
its
evacuation
by
the
germans
one
of
the
first
french
artillery
shells
blew
into
shreds
the
german
flag
flying
triumphantly
over
the
fort
thus
depriving
the
french
of
the
satisfaction
of
hauling
it
down
toward
evening
the
germans
retreated
toward
the
lesse
followed
by
the
french
in
previous
wars
the
forces
engaged
were
of
sufficient
strength
to
designate
dinant
a
battle
but
with
the
vast
armies
of
the
present
conflict
it
sinks
to
the
military
grade
of
a
mere
affair
however
it
is
called
by
the
french
the
battle
of
dinant
the
troops
which
entered
alsace
on
august
to
the
number
of
to
belonged
to
the
army
of
the
frontier
this
first
army
which
was
under
the
orders
of
general
dubail
was
intrusted
with
the
mission
of
making
a
vigorous
attack
and
of
holding
in
front
of
it
the
greatest
possible
number
of
german
forces
the
general
in
command
of
this
army
had
under
his
orders
if
the
detachment
from
alsace
be
included
five
army
corps
and
a
division
of
cavalry
his
orders
were
to
seek
battle
along
the
line
in
the
bruche
valley
at
the
same
time
possessing
himself
of
the
crests
of
the
vosges
as
well
as
the
mountain
passes
these
operations
were
to
have
as
their
theaters
the
vosges
mountains
the
plateau
of
lorraine
to
the
northwest
of
donon
and
the
left
bank
of
the
meurthe
this
left
bank
of
the
meurthe
is
separated
from
the
valley
of
the
moselle
by
a
bristling
slope
of
firs
which
is
traversed
by
a
series
of
passages
the
defiles
of
chipotte
of
the
croix
idoux
of
the
haut
jacques
of
vanemont
of
plafond
in
these
passes
when
the
french
returned
to
the
offensive
in
september
furious
combats
took
place
the
german
forces
opposed
to
this
first
army
consisted
of
five
active
army
corps
and
a
reserve
corps
the
first
french
army
after
a
violent
struggle
conquered
the
passes
of
the
vosges
but
the
conquest
was
vigorously
opposed
and
took
more
time
than
the
french
had
reckoned
on
as
soon
as
it
had
become
master
of
the
donon
and
the
passes
the
first
french
army
pushed
forward
into
the
defile
of
saarburg
at
blaise
it
won
the
first
german
colors
took
blamont
and
cirey
august
seized
the
defiles
north
of
the
canal
of
the
marne
and
the
rhine
and
reached
saarburg
here
a
connection
was
established
with
the
army
of
lorraine
which
had
commenced
its
operations
on
the
a
violent
battle
ensued
known
under
the
name
of
the
battle
of
saarburg
the
left
wing
of
the
french
army
attacked
august
it
hurled
itself
at
the
fortified
positions
which
were
copiously
fringed
with
heavy
artillery
in
spite
of
the
opposition
it
made
progress
to
the
northwest
of
saarburg
on
the
the
attack
was
renewed
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
evident
that
it
could
not
succeed
and
that
the
duty
intrusted
to
the
eighth
army
corps
of
opening
up
the
way
for
the
cavalry
corps
could
not
be
accomplished
this
army
corps
had
gone
through
a
trying
ordeal
as
a
result
of
the
bombardment
by
the
heavy
german
artillery
established
in
fortified
positions
covering
distances
all
measured
in
advance
with
every
group
and
french
battery
presenting
a
sure
target
and
the
action
of
the
french
cannon
rendered
useless
if
the
left
wing
of
the
first
army
found
itself
checked
the
center
and
the
right
on
the
other
hand
were
in
an
excellent
position
and
were
able
to
advance
but
at
this
point
august
the
second
french
army
the
army
of
lorraine
met
a
serious
reverse
in
the
region
of
morhange
and
was
compelled
to
retreat
this
retreat
left
the
flank
of
the
first
army
gravely
unprotected
and
as
a
consequence
this
army
was
also
obliged
to
fall
back
this
movement
was
accomplished
over
a
very
difficult
piece
of
country
down
to
the
de
line
south
of
the
col
du
bonhomme
it
was
found
necessary
to
abandon
the
donon
and
the
col
de
sapt
the
task
committed
to
the
second
army
that
of
lorraine
under
de
castlenau
was
to
protect
nancy
then
to
transfer
itself
to
the
east
advancing
later
to
the
north
and
attacking
in
a
line
parallel
to
that
taken
by
the
first
army
on
the
salins
front
in
the
general
direction
of
saarbrücken
its
mission
was
therefore
at
once
both
offensive
and
defensive
to
cover
nancy
and
continue
toward
the
west
the
attack
of
the
first
army
after
having
repulsed
august
and
the
strong
german
attacks
in
the
region
of
spincourt
and
of
château
salins
the
second
army
took
the
offensive
and
went
forward
almost
without
stopping
during
four
days
of
uninterrupted
fighting
penetrating
into
lorraine
which
had
been
annexed
it
reached
the
right
bank
of
the
selle
cut
off
marsal
and
château
salins
and
pushed
forward
in
the
direction
of
morhange
the
enemy
fell
back
at
marsal
he
even
left
behind
enormous
quantities
of
ammunition
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
fell
back
on
positions
that
had
been
carefully
fortified
in
advance
and
whence
his
artillery
could
bombard
at
an
almost
perfectly
accurate
range
august
made
a
violent
counterattack
on
the
canal
of
salines
and
morhange
in
the
lake
district
the
immediate
vicinity
of
metz
furnished
the
german
army
with
a
vast
quantity
of
heavy
artillery
which
played
a
decisive
role
in
the
battle
of
morhange
the
french
retreated
and
during
this
movement
the
frontier
city
of
lunéville
was
for
some
days
occupied
by
the
germans
thus
the
first
and
second
armies
failed
in
their
offensive
and
saw
themselves
obliged
to
retreat
but
their
retreat
was
accomplished
under
excellent
circumstances
and
the
troops
after
a
couple
of
days
of
rest
found
themselves
in
a
condition
again
to
take
the
offensive
the
first
army
gave
energetic
support
to
the
second
army
which
was
violently
attacked
by
the
germans
in
the
second
week
of
august
the
german
attack
which
was
first
arrayed
against
nancy
turned
more
and
more
to
the
east
the
battle
at
first
waged
in
the
mortagne
basin
was
gradually
extended
to
the
deep
woods
on
the
left
bank
of
the
meurthe
and
on
to
chipotte
nompatelize
etc
the
battles
that
have
been
named
the
battle
of
mortagne
the
battle
of
the
meurthe
the
battle
of
the
vosges
all
waged
by
the
first
army
were
extremely
violent
in
the
last
week
of
august
and
the
first
two
weeks
of
september
these
combats
partly
coincided
with
the
battle
of
the
marne
they
resulted
at
the
end
of
that
battle
in
the
german
retreat
the
second
army
renewed
the
offensive
august
it
decisively
checked
the
march
of
the
german
army
and
commenced
to
force
it
back
the
instructions
issued
to
general
de
castelnau
directed
him
everywhere
to
march
forward
and
make
direct
attacks
the
day
of
august
was
a
successful
day
for
the
french
everywhere
the
germans
were
repulsed
from
august
till
september
the
second
army
continued
its
attacks
at
this
point
the
commander
in
chief
having
need
of
important
forces
at
his
center
and
at
his
right
relieved
the
second
army
of
much
of
its
strength
this
did
not
prevent
it
from
engaging
in
the
great
battle
of
nancy
and
winning
it
it
was
september
that
this
battle
began
and
it
continued
till

the
incessant
assaults
of
the

on
its

head
it
was

to
make

enormous
expenditure

one
of
the
most
important
positions
of
the
grand
couronne
of
nancy
more
than
howitzer
shells
were
fired
in
two
days
the
fights
among
the
infantry
were
characterized
on
the
entire
front
by
an
alternation
of
failure
and
success
every
point
being
taken
lost
and
retaken
at
intervals
the
struggle
attained
to
especial
violence
in
the
champenoux
forest
on
september
the
enemy
won
maixe
and
remereville
which
they
lost
again
in
the
evening
but
they
were
unable
to
dislodge
the
french
from
the

of

rapidly
they
evacuated

when
the
germans
occupied
brussels
on

we
observed
that

swept
to

this

which

advancing
south
by

to
fall
in

beside

to
the
capture

meanwhile
von

had
advanced
up
the

of

with
its

sweeping
the

uplands
some
part
of
this
army
may
have
been
transported
by
rail
from
montmedy
its
general
advance
in

was
directed
chiefly
upon
the
sambre
crossings
as
von

covered
a
greater
distance
von
bülow
army
was
expected
to
strike
the

some
hours
earlier
its
march
therefore
was
in
the
nature
of
an
onrush
but
von

was
now
in
the
full
tide
of
fighting
strength
an
amazing
spectacle
to
chance
or
enforced
witnesses
well
may
the
terrified
peasants
have
stood
hat
in
hand
in
the
midst
of
their
ruined
villages
any
door
not
left
open
was
immediately
broken
down
and
the
interior
searched
here
and
there
a
soldier
could
be
seen
carrying
a
souvenir
from
some
wrecked
château
but
for
the
most
part
everyone
fled
from
before
its
path
leaving
it
silent
and
abandoned
the
field
uniforms
were
almost
invisible
in
cover
in
a
half
light
or
when
advancing
through
mist
no
conceivable
detail
seemed
to
have
been
overlooked
each

carried
a
complete

down
to
handy
trifles
the
whole
weighed
to
the
fraction
of
an
ounce
in
carefully
estimated
proportions
but
this
was
not
enough
waiting
for
each
column
to
pass
were
men
with
buckets
of
drinking
water
into
which
the
soldiers
dipped
their
aluminum
cups
temporary
field
post
offices
were
established
in
advance
so
that

could
be
gathered
in
as
the

passed

and
there
were

it
moved

always
at

passed
down

when
there
was
any

a

in

the

marched
through

no

granted
to

though
it
was
the

it
is
safe
to
assert
there
was
not
a

straggler
in

at
the
first
sign
of

he
was
admonished
with
a
vigor
to
deter
his

discipline
was
severely
maintained
at
every

the
click

and
rattle
of

went
on
down

with
the
sharp
delivery
of

on

august
the
town
of
huy
situated
midway
between

and
namur
was
seized
it
possessed
an
old
citadel
but
it
was
disarmed
and
used
now
only
as
a
storehouse
some

detachments
offered
a
slight
resistance
at

but
were
speedily
driven
off
the

broken
at

into

in
a
sweeping
attack
upon
the
advancing
germans
a
brief
survey
of
the
city
and
fortifications
will
be
necessary
the
situation
of
the
city
is
not
as
imposing
as
that
of
liege
for
the
most
part
it
sits
on
a
hillside
declivity
to
rest
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
it
is
a
place
of
some
historic
and
industrial
importance
though
in
the
latter
respect
not
so
well
known
as
liege
to
the
west
however
up
the
valley
of
the
sambre
the
country
presents
the
usual
features
of
a
mining
region
pit
shafts
tall
chimneys
issuing
clouds
of
black
smoke
and
huge
piles
of
unsightly
débris
while
away
to
the
north
stretches
the
great
plain
of
central
belgium
southward
the
central
meuse
offers
a
more
picturesque
prospect
in
wooded
slopes
rising
to
hilltops
directly
east
the
meuse
flows
into
the
precipitous
cut
on
its
way
to
liege
but
in
belgian
eyes
the
fame
of
namur
lay
to
a
great
extent
in
its
being
the
second
of
brialmont
fortress
masterpieces
its
plan
was
that
of
liege
a
ring
of
outer
detached
forts
constructed
on
the
same
cupola
principle
at
namur
these
were
nine
in
number
four
major
forts
and
five
the
distance
between
each
fort
was
on
the
average
two
and
a
half
miles
with
between
two
and
a
half
to
five
miles
from
the
city
as
the
center
of
the
circumference
facing
von
bülow
advance
fort
cognlée
protected
the
brussels
railway
while
the
guns
of
marchovelette
swept
the
space
between
it
and
the
left
bank
of
the
meuse
in
the
southwest
angle
formed
by
the

forts
maizeret

continued
the
ring
again
in
the

of

sambre
and
meuse
forts
héribert
and
malonne
protected
the
city
north
of
the
sambre
forts
suarlée
and
emines
completed
the
circle
in
the
emergency
namur
possessed
one
advantage
over
liege
the
resistance
of
liege
gave
namur
due
warning
of
the
german
invasion
and
some
days
to
prepare
for
attack
general
michel
was
in
command
or
the
garrison
of
namur
which
comprised
from
to
men
doubtless
reports
had
come
to
him
of
the
situation
at
liege
he
immediately
set
to
work
to
overcome
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
brialmont
plan
at
liege
by
constructing
trenches
between
the
forts
protected
by
barbed
wire
entanglements
and
mines
in
advance
of
the
german
approach
as
his
circumference
of
defense
was
less
than
that
of
liege
his
force
promised
to
be
capable
of
a
more
prolonged
resistance
besides
the
allies
were
close
at
hand
only
eighteen
miles
separated
him
from
strong
detachments
of
french
infantry
and
artillery
at
dinant
as
we
have
seen
french
cavalry
had
been
thrown
forward
as
far
as
gembloux
on
the
road
to
brussels
but
ten
miles
to
the
northeast
of
namur
somewhere
between
that
place
and
charleroi
french
chasseurs
had
advanced
to
occupy
outpost
positions
his
position
appeared
by
no
means
hopeless
considerably
better
than
the
unsupported
field
army
at
liege
the
armor
of
his
forts
was
calculated
to
withstand
the
shells
of
the
heaviest
german
fieldpieces
but
comparatively
slight
damage
was
anticipated
from
the
known
heavier
howitzers
if
the
germans
purposed
to
assault
namur
in
mass
formation
as
they
had
done
at
liege
general
michel
had
every
reason
to
feel
confident
he
could
repulse
them
with
tremendous
losses
but
the
germans
had
learned
a
severely
taught
lesson
at
liege
they
had
no
intention
of
repeating
those
tactics
behind
a
remarkable
screen
of
secrecy
they
managed
to
conceal
from
general
michel
as
they
did
from
the
allies
the
existence
of
their
enormous
siege
guns
whether
they
brought
into
action
at
namur
their
famous
capable
of
throwing
a
shell
of
high
explosive
power
weighing
is
uncertain
in
fact
it
is
still
doubtful
where
they
were
first
fired
at
the
allied
enemy
two
are
said
to
have
assisted
in
the
final
destruction
of
the
northern
forts
of
liege
and
two
were
seen
rolling
over
the
field
of
waterloo
the
germans
remained
silent
upon
the
subject
and
nothing
definite
about
their
first
discharge
was
disclosed
but
unquestionably
their
fire
was
capable
of
demolishing
into
ruin
any
fort
on
earth
within
a
short
period
it
is
certain
however
the
germans
brought
against
namur
their
guns
and
probably
some
of
caliber
these
artillery
weapons
were
quite
formidable
enough
to
reduce
the
namur
forts
the
former
threw
a
shell
of
pounds
from
a
range
of
three
miles
beyond
the
reach
of
the
namur
guns
the
latter
projected
shells
of
pounds
the
germans
are
said
to
have
employed
of
the
heavier
caliber
guns
and
a
large
number
of
thus
namur
was
doomed
before
the
bombardment
commenced

up
the

miles
from
its

fell
upon

hot
and
sultry
august
atmosphere
presently
the
flashes
and
boom
of
the
german
guns
began
a
bombardment
of
the
trenches
between
forts
cognelée
and
marchovelette
it
continued
through
the
night
but
the
belgian
fortress
guns
were
outranged
it
would
have
been
a
mere
waste
of
ammunition
to
reply
neither
could
the
belgian
infantry
venture
on
a
counterattack
for
the
germans
were
clearly
observed
in
overwhelming
strength
at
the
outset
the
germans
devoted
their
efforts
to
clearing
the
trenches
of
the
belgian
infantry
leaving
the
forts
for
subsequent
demolition
the
unfortunate
belgian
infantry
therefore
could
do
nothing
but
fire
intermittent
rifle
volleys
without
any
effect
upon
the
germans
they
bravely
bore
this
storm
of
shells
for
ten
hours
not
a
man
who
lifted
his
head
above
the
german
machine
parapets
but
was
not
instantly
killed
or
wounded
thus
the
majority
of
the
officers
were
killed
and
the
ranks
within
the
trenches
decimated
toward
morning
on
august
the
belgians
could
stand
the
tornado
of
death
no
longer
the
demoralized
troops
fled
from
the
trenches
leaving
the
gap
between
forts
cognelée
and
marchovelette
open
the
germans
then
opened
fire
on
the
forts
in
comparison
with
the
new
german
siege

the
belgian
guns
proved
to
be
weak
weapons
the
tremendous
pounding
of
the
german
shells
not
only
smashed
the
fort
cupolas
and
crumpled
into
ruin
the
interior
stone
and

protective

but
quickly
put
the
belgian

out

while

at
the
speed
of
twenty
to

hasten
to

but

was
for
the

within

the

some

arrive

the

revealed

therefore
decided
upon
the
evacuation
of

by

it
was
successfully
accomplished
though
even
more
in
the
nature
of
a
flight
than
at

went
with

remaining

had
some
adventurous
wandering
before
them
they
had
first
to
cut
their
way
through
a
body
of
german
troops
then
to
become
involved
with
a
french
force
near
charleroi
it
took
them
seven
days
to
reach
rouen
by

of
amiens
there
they
were
embarked
for

at

they
joined

after
its
retreat
from
antwerp
on
sunday
morning
august
the
germans
began
the
bombardment
of
fort
suarlée
this
fort
repeated
the
heroic
resistance
of
fort
boncelles
at
liege
it
held
out
until
the
afternoon
of
august
it
was
apparently
then
blown
up
by
the
explosion
of
its
own
magazine
thus
again
repeating
the
end
of
fort
loncin
at
liege
meantime
the
germans
had
succeeded
in
reducing
forts
cognelée
and
emines
the
germans
entered
namur
on
the
afternoon
of
august
there
seems
to
have
been
some
oversight
in
the
plan
for
the
advance
guard
found
themselves
under
fire
of
their
own
guns
directed
upon
the
citadel
and
the

place
this
however
was
speedily
rectified
their
behavior
was
much
the
same
as
at
louvain
and
brussels
they
marched
in
with
bands
playing
and
singing
patriotic
songs
proclamations
were
at
once
issued
warning
the
citizens
not
to
commit
any
hostile
act
the
inhabitants
were
far
too
cowed
to
contemplate
anything
but
submission
good
discipline
was
preserved
and
though
the
city
took
fire
that
night
there
is
nothing
to
show
it
was
from
german
design
the
citizens
were
induced
to
come
forth
from
their
cellars

reopen

was
so
continuous
upon

that
it
was
impossible
to

crumpled

the

departments
lacked
efficiency
or
energy

both

not
gaining

chapter
viii
battle
of
charleroi
toward
the
end
of
the
third
week
of
august
the
atmosphere
of
every
european
capital
became
tense
with
the
realization
that
a
momentous
crisis
was
impending
it
was
known
that
the
armies
confronted
german
armies
of
equal
if
not
of
superior
strength
in
paris
and
london
the
military
critics
wrote
optimistically
that
the
germans
were
marching
into
a
trap
the
british
army
had
arrived
at
the
front
in
splendid
fighting
trim
it
was
difficult
to
restrain
the
impetuous
valor
of
the
french
soldiers
the
skies
were
bright
and
there
was
confidence
that
the
germans
would
unquestionably
meet
with
a
crushing
defeat
let
us
glance
at
the
line
of
the
french
and
british
armies
stretched
along
the
belgian
frontier
it
ran
from
within
touch
of
namur
up
the
right
bank
of
the
sambre
through
charleroi
to
binche
and
mons
thence
by
way
of
the
coal
barge
canal
just
within
the
french
frontier
to
condé
for
the
choice
of
a
great
battle
ground
there
was
nothing
particularly
attractive
about
it
in
a
military
sense
there
is
evidence
to
show
in
an
official
communiqué
from
general
joffre
published
on
august
that
it
was
intended
to
be
merely
the
left
wing
of
a
gigantic
french
battle
offensive
on
the
adopted
german
plan
from
condé
to
belfort
an
army
runs
the
communiqué
advancing
from
the
northern
part
of
the
woevre
and
moving
on
neufchâteau
is
attacking
the
german
forces
which
have
been
going
through
the
duchy
of
luxemburg
and
are
on
the
right
bank
of
the
samoy
another
army
from
the
region
of
sedan
is
traversing
the
belgian
ardennes
and
attacking
the
german
forces
marching
between
the
lesse
and
the
meuse
a
third
army
from
the
region
of
chimay
has
attacked
the
german
right
between
the
sambre
and
the
meuse
it
is
supported
by
the
english
army
from
the
region
of
mons
these
attacks
comprised
chiefly
the
battle
of
dinant
and
cavalry
skirmishing
but
the
purpose
of
general
joffre
was
otherwise
made
plain
in
throwing
advance
french
troops
across
the
belgian
frontier
into
ligny
and
gembloux
on
the
road
to
a
recapture
of
brussels
this
we
have
previously
noted
in
another
connection
the
rout
of
the
french
army
in
lorraine
however
put
an
end
to
the
grand
offensive
thus
the
line
became
a
main
defensive
position
instead
of
an
offensive
left
wing
sweep
through
belgium
upon
germany
as
such
it
was
well
enough
if
its
pivot
on
the
fortress
of
namur
held
secure
liege
had
already
proved
its
vulnerability
but
it
would
seem
that
the
french
general
staff
joined
with
general
michel
the
commander
of
namur
in
believing
the
namur
forts
would
give
a
better
account
the
french
general
staff
were
informed
of
the
approximate
strength
of
the
advancing
armies
of
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
and
had
nothing
to
fear
from
inferiority
in
numbers
the
staff
never
gave
out
the
strength
of
their
forces
but
there
is
reason
for
believing
the
great
armies
were
nearly
equally
matched
after
mobilization
about
men
let
us
now
see
what
was
developing
in
the
ardennes
away
to
the
french
right
it
has
been
established
that
woods
particularly
in
summer
form
the
best
cover
from
the
observation
or
attacks
of
airmen
the
spreading
leafy
boughs
are
difficult
to
penetrate
visually
from
a
height
of
even
a
few
hundred
feet
at
least
to
obtain
accurate
information
of
what
is
transpiring
beneath
french
air
scouts
brought
in
correct
information
that
they
had
seen
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
massed
along
the
southern
luxemburg
and
belgian
forest
region
but
under
the
foliage
there
was
another
army
unseen
that
of
general
von
hausen
the
french
moved
their
fifth
army
up
to
position
on
the
line
of
the
sambre
they
advanced
their
third
army
commanded
by
general
ruffey
upon
luxemburg
and
their
fourth
army
under
general

langle

cary
across
the
river
semois
to
watch
the

left
bank
and
gain
touch
with

lanzerac
general
de
cary
came
from

throwing
out

upon
the
meuse
left
bank
these
operations
were
to
confront
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
but
the
french
apparently
knew
nothing
of
the
movements
of
the
army
of
general
von
hausen
their
air
scouts
either
could
not
distinguish
it
from
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
the
crown
prince
amid
the
forest
of
the
ardennes
or
they
did
not
observe
it
at
all
to
the
army
of
general
von
hausen
there
clings
a
good
deal
of
mystery
when
last
noted
by
us
previous
to
the
minor
battle
of
dinant
it
had
been
formed
by
forces
drawn
from
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
ostensibly
at
that
time
it
was
destined
to
support
as
a
separate
field
force
the
armies
of
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
possibly
the
germans
had
begun
to
doubt
how
long
liege
could
hold
out
von
kluck
was
compelled
to
mark
time
in
his
impetuous
march
on
central
belgium
his
losses
had
been
heavy
support
in
strength
seemed
urgent
but
this
need
passed
as
the
liege
forts
fell
one
after
the
other
under
the
fire
of
the
german
siege
guns
general
von
hausen
was
released
for
action
elsewhere
thus
we
may
assume
he
was
ordered
to
follow
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
down
through
the
ardennes
to
strike
the
meuse
south
of
namur
by
this
time
he
had
been
substantially
reenforced
now
under
his
command
were
the
complete
twelfth
and
nineteenth
corps
and
the
eleventh
reserve
corps
also
a
cavalry
division
of
the
prussian
guard
with
some
other
detachments
of
cavalry
his
eleventh
reserve
corps
were
hessians
the
twelfth
and
nineteenth
corps
were
saxons
the
latter
two
corps
were
regarded
as
among
the
best
in
the
german
army
in
the
war
they
fought
with
conspicuous
bravery
through
every
battle
in
which
they
were
engaged
they
won
the
battle
for
prussia
at
gravelotte
by
turning
the
french
right
and
capturing
privat
they
marched
to
sedan
under
the
crown
prince
subsequently
the
emperor
frederick
to
occupy
the
first
line
in
the
hard
fighting
of
the
givonne
valley
during
the
siege
of
paris
they
occupied
a
part
of
the
german
northern
line
finally
to
march
in
triumph
into
paris
this
infantry
and
cavalry
of
the
prussian
guard
stiffened
von
hausen
force
into
an
army
of
battle
strength
we
have
thus
two
factors
to
bear
in
mind
with
regard
to
the
french
defensive
position
at
charleroi
the
resisting
power
of
the
namur
forts
and
the
unknown
to
the
french
proximity
of
von
army
however
substantial
was
the
measure
of
reliance
that
the
french
general
staff
and
general
michel
placed
on
the
namur
forts
evidently
general
von
bülow
regarded
them
as
little
more
than
passing
targets
for
his
siege
guns
he
seemed
to
have
made
a
comparatively
simple
mathematical
calculation
of
almost
the
number
of
shells
necessary
to
fire
and
the
hours
to
be
consumed
in
reducing
the
namur
forts
to
masses
of
débris
we
can
picture
general
von
bülow
as
he
sat
in
the
motor
car
with
marshal
von
der
goltz
the
old
gentleman
with
an
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
his
nose
in
august
and
huge
spectacles
doubtless
discussion
ran
mainly
upon
the
impending
attack
of
their
second
army
on
the
french
right
emphasis
would
have
been
laid
on
the
positions
of
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
advancing
away
to
their
left
upon
the
forces
of
the
french
generals
ruffey
and
de
cary
but
there
was
apparently
a
german
gap
here
between
von
bülow
army
and
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
crown
prince
though
we
noticed
previously
von
bülow
army
came
in
touch
with
saxon
troops
half
way
between
huy
and
namur
when
a
detachment
of
von
bülow
left
wing
was
thrown
across
the
meuse
at
ardenne
this
gap
was
faced
by
the
french
extreme
right
resting
on
the
southward
namur
bend
of
the
meuse
it
was
possibly
the
trap
military
critics
of
the
moment
foresaw
for
the
germans
quite
likely
the
two
german
generals
von
bülow
and
von
der
goltz
chatting
in
their
motor
car
referred
to
this
gap
and
it
is
hardly
a
stretch
of
imagination
to
suggest
a
twinkle
in
the
huge
glasses
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
august
overcoat
when
now
and
then
the
name
of
von
hausen
was
mentioned
the
german
attack
on
the
french
right
began
early
in
the
morning
of
friday
august
a
party
of
german
hussars
crossed
the
meuse
rode
through
charleroi
and
trotted
on
toward
the
sambre
at
first
they
were
mistaken
for
a
british
cavalry
patrol
probably
the
populace
in
charleroi
were
not
sufficiently
familiar
at
that
time
with
the
british
hussar
uniform
to
distinguish
it
from
the
german
in
all
armies
hussar
uniforms
bear
a
close
resemblance
a
french
officer
however
presently
detected
the
situation
after
a
skirmish
the
german
hussars
were
driven
off
with
the
loss
of
a
few
killed
and
wounded
but
the
raid
evidently
came
out
of
the
gap
as
a
surprise
to
the
french
the
citizens
were
promptly
ordered
to
their
homes
barricades
were
raised
in
the
streets
and
mitrailleuses
were
placed
in
sweeping
positions
an
artillery
engagement
began
at
jemappe
nine
miles
above
namur
on
the
left
bank
of
the
sambre
between
von
bülow
vanguard
and
the
main
french
right
later
in
the
day
von
bülow
vanguard
artillery
had
advanced
to
open
fire
on
charleroi
and
thuin
seven
miles
beyond
on
saturday
august
von
bülow
attacked
charleroi
in
full
strength
as
we
have
seen
he
had
already
practically
settled
with
namur
their
main
assault
on
saturday
was
delivered
on
the
sambre
bridges
at
chatelet
and
thuin
below
and
above
charleroi
respectively
sometime
on
saturday
they
succeeded
in
crossing
to
turn
charleroi
into
one
of
the
most
frightful
street
battle
grounds
in
history
the
conflict
raged
for
the
possession
of
iron
foundries
glass
works
and
other
factories
the
thoroughfares
were
swept
by
storms
of
fire
tall
chimneys
toppled
over
and
crashed
to
the
ground
burying
defenders
grouped
near
under
piles
of
débris
desperate
encounters
took
place
in
workshops
stations
and
manufacturing
plants
the
normal
whir
of
machinery
now
silent
was
succeeded
by
the
crack
and
spitting
of
continuous
rifle
fire
the
and
zouave
troops
fought
with
savage
ferocity
with
gleaming
eyes
using
bayonets
and
knives
to
contest
alleys
and
passageways
house
doors
were
battered
in
to
reach
those
firing
from
upper
windows
roofs
and
yard
walls
were
scaled
in
chase
of
fleeing
parties
the
germans
were
driven
out
of
charleroi
several
times
only
to
return
in
stronger
force
similarly
with
the
french
with
each
change
of
victors
the
losing
side
turned
to
bombard
with
a
torrent
of
artillery
shells
the
city
at
nightfall
on
august
charleroi
burst
into
flames
a
dread
and
significant
glow
fell
upon
the
sky
absent
were
the
usual
intermittent
flare
of
blast
furnaces
the
greater
part
of
charleroi
had
become
a
heap
of
ruins
those
of
its
citizens
still
alive
cowered
in
holes
or
corners
for
shelter
the
battle
of
charleroi
went
on
throughout
the
night
early
on
the
morning
of
sunday
august
von
hausen
swept
down
through
the
gap
between
the
armies
of
von
bülow
and
the
duke
of
württemberg
he
crossed
the
meuse
drove
from
before
him
the
french
detachments
watching
it
and
advanced
to
attack
the
rear
of
the
french
right
von
hausen
took
the
french
at
charleroi
completely
by
surprise
at
the
moment
they
could
comprehend
neither
where
he
came
from
nor
the
measure
of
his
strength
but
he
was
in
army
force
the
french
were
compelled
to
withdraw
their
right
from
charleroi
von
hausen
seized
the
advantage
to
hurl
his
forces
upon
their
rear
while
von
bülow
thundered
in
assault
more
vigorously
than
ever
on
the
french
front
a
powerful
force
was
hurled
upon
them
from
an
unexpected
direction
presently
the
retreat
of
the
french
fifth
army
was
threatened
by
the
two
saxon
corps
of
von
hausen
army
pressing
on
the
french
right
flank
and
rear
in
this
emergency
the
retirement
of
the
french
fifth
army
appears
to
have
been
undertaken
with
spontaneous
realization
of
utmost
danger
it
gave
way
before
the
attacks
of
von
bülow
and
von
hausen
to
move
southward
leaving
their
british
left
wing
without
information
of
defeat
chapter

he
was
a

like
the

and
a
comparatively
young
man
for
such
a

that

ample

von

of

came
from
that
branch
of
the
service
cavalry
officers
are
excellent
soldiers
but
their
training
as
such
is
not
promising
for
the
command
of
modern
armies
mainly
of
infantry
and
artillery
with
other
complements
in
war
much
has
changed
since
waterloo
with
the
value
of
cavalry
retreating
into
the
background
as
aeroplanes
sweep
to
the
front
for
scouting
and
other
purposes
from
binche
to
condé
the
line
assigned
to
the
british
was
approximately
miles
their
force
totaled
some
men
with
guns
general
french
therefore
had
men
to
the
mile
of
front
this
was
an
insufficient
force
as
the
usual
fighting
front
for
a
battalion
of
a
thousand
men
in
defense
or
in
attack
is
estimated
in
all
armies
at
about
yards
the
british
brigade
of
four
battalions
rifles
covers
a
front
general
french
third
army
corps
having
been
utilized
elsewhere
he
was
compelled
to
use
his
cavalry
in
four
brigades
as
reserve
previous
to
the
german
attack
on
charleroi
general
joffre
still
held
to
his
plan
of
a
attack
or
rather
a
after
the
germans
were
beaten
but
battles
were
commencing
on
other
fronts
properly
belonging
to
the
general
retreat
which
made
its
execution
doubtful
even
in
an
hour
of
victory
the
capture
of
charleroi
of
course
dissipated
it
as
a
dream
that
general
french
realized
the
superiority
in
numbers
of
von
kluck
advancing
army
both
in
infantry
and
artillery
is
nowhere
suggested
his
airmen
had
merely
brought
in
the
information
that
the
attack
would
be
in
considerable
force
the
french
intelligence
service
were
led
to
believe
and
informed
the
british
commander
that
von
kluck
was
advancing
upon
him
with
only
one
corps
or
two
at
the
most
some
of
general
cavalry

as
far
toward
brussels
as
soignes
during

confirmed
it
but
the
british
proceeded
to
prepare
for
attack
immediately
on
taking
position
they
set
to
work
digging
trenches
while
continuing
their
defensive
efforts
through
saturday
august
there
floated
to
them
a
distant
rumble
from
the
eastward
opinions
differed
as
to
whether
it
was
the
german
guns
bombarding
namur
or
a
battle
in
progress
on
the
sambre
for
the
most
part
british
officers
and
men
had
but
a
vague
idea
of
their
position
or
the
progress
of
the
fighting
in
the
vicinity
even
the
headquarters
staff
remained
uninformed
of
the
desperate
situation
developing
on
the
french
right
at
charleroi
the
headquarters
of
the
british

was
at

is
the

degenerate
type
of

distant

of

from

continued
to

doubtless

they
again
speculated
over

wondering
and
possibly
regretting
a
chance

sunday
morning

dawned

general
french
gathered
his
generals
for
an
early
conference
general
joffre
message
on
saturday
morning
assured
general
french
of
victory
and
positively
informed
him
that
von
kluck
was
advancing
upon
him
with
no
more
than
one
or
two
army
corps
in
testimony
of
it
general
french
thus
wrote
a
subsequent
official
dispatch
from
information
i
received
from
french
headquarters
i
understood
that
little
more
than
one
or
at
most
two
of
the
enemy
army
corps
with
perhaps
one
cavalry
division
were
in
front
of
my
position
and
i
was
aware
of
no
outflanking
movement
attempted
by
the
enemy
von
hausen
advance
on
the
right
i
was
confirmed
in
this
opinion
by
the
fact
that
my
patrols
encountered
no
undue
opposition
in
their
reconnoitering
operations
the
observations
of
my
aeroplanes
seemed
also
to
bear
out
this
estimate
to
general
french
therefore
his
position
seemed
well
secured
in
the
light
of
it
he
awaited
von
kluck
attack
with
confidence
toward
some
german
aeroplanes

british
line
british

at
once
fired
on

and
hawklike
wings
of
the

some
tense
interest
was
roused
among
the
men
as
british
aeroplanes
rose
to
encounter
the
german
aircraft
it
was
the
first
real
battle
of
the
sky
they
had
witnessed
general
french
cavalry
patrols
now
brought
information
that
the
woods
were
thick
with
german
troops
some
of
them
deploying
eastward
toward
their
right
at
binche
at
twenty
minutes
to
one
the
first
shots
swept
from
the
woods
upon
the
british
line
presently

main
attack
developed
with
great
rapidity
the
german
artillery
was
brought
to
the
front
edge
of
the
woods
to
hurl
a
storm
of
shells
on
the
british
trenches
it
was
returned
with
equal
vigor
but
very
soon
it
became
apparent
to
british
commanders
along
the
line
that
the
german
artillery
fire
was
in
far
greater
volume
than
what
might
be
expected
from
two
army
corps
whose
normal
complement
would
be
some
guns
instead
it
was
estimated
german
guns
were
shortly
brought
into
action
the
battle
field
was
described
by
the
germans
as
an
emptiness
the
term
is
intended
to
emphasize
that
the
old
martial
display
and
pomp
has
completely
gone
a
grand
advance
upon
each
other
with
trumpets
sounding
banners
fluttering
brilliant
uniforms
and
splendid
cavalry
charges
was
impossible
with
long
range
weapons
hailing
storms
of
bullets
and
shells
of
devastating
explosive
power
cover
was
the
all
important
immediate
aim
of
both
attack
and
defense
in
this
respect
as
we
have
seen
the
german
uniform
assisted
by
rendering
them
almost
invisible
within
shelter
of
such
woods
as
those
before
mons
on
the
other
hand
the
brown
khaki
shade
of
the
british
field
uniforms
originally
designed
for
the
same
purpose
on
the
sandy
wastes
of
egypt
and
northern
india
became
conspicuous
upon
a
green
background
as
the
battle
of
mons
developed
the
british
line
of
the
condé
canal
was
swept
with
german
shrapnel
german
shells
also
began
bursting
in
the
suburbs
of
mons
and
in
the
villages
sir
douglas
haig
right
thus
came
under
strong
fire
german
aeroplanes
assisted
by
dropping
smoke
bombs
over
the
british
positions
to
give
the
angle
of
range
for
their
artillery
thereupon
fights
above
took
place
between
british
and
german
airmen
while
the
armies
beneath
thundered
shot
and
shell
upon
each
other
the
germans
came
on
in
massed
formation
of
attack
the
british
were
accustomed
to
attack
in
open
extended
line
and
their
shooting
from
any
available
cover
was
generally
excellent
they
could
not
understand
the
german
attack
in
such
close
order
that
they
were
mowed
down
in
groups
of
hundreds
the
german
infantry
rifle
fire
breaking
from
the
shelter
of
the
woods
to
encounter
a
stronger
british
fire
than
was
anticipated
was
at
first
ineffective
as
to
the
mass
formation
they
depended
upon
overwhelming
reserves
to
take
the
places
of
those
dead
piled
in
heaps
before
the
british
trenches
it
was
general
grant
food
for

plan
of
attack
repeated
thus
the
battle
raged
upon
the
entire
length
of
the
british
line
with
repeated
advances
and
retreats
on
the
part
of
the
germans
now
and
then
the
bodies
almost
reached
the
british
trenches
and
a
breach
seemed
in
certain
prospect
but
the
british
sprang
upon
the
invaders
bayonet
in
hand
and
drove
them
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
woods
the
irish
regiments
especially
were
considered
invincible
in
this
cold
steel
method
of
attack
their
national
impulsive
ardor
carrying
them
in
a
fury
through
the
ranks
of
an
enemy
but
at
mons
always
the
germans
returned
in
ever
greater
numbers
the
artillery
increased
the
terrible
rain
of
shells
pen
pictures
by
british
soldiers
vividly
describe
the
battle
somewhat
conflictingly
they
were
in
solid
square
blocks
standing
out
sharply
against
the
skyline
and
you
could
help
hitting
them
it
was
like
butting
your
head
against
a
stone
wall
they
crept
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
our
officers
gave
the
word
a
sheet
of
flame
flickered
along
the
line
of
trenches
and
a
stream
of
bullets
tore
through
the
advancing
mass
of
germans
they
seemed
to
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
hit
between
the
eyes
after
which
they
made
a
run
for
us
halfway
across
the
open
another
volley
tore
through
their
ranks
and
by
this
time
our
artillery
began
dropping
shells
around
them
then
an
officer
gave
an
order
and
they
broke
into
open
formation
rushing
like
mad
toward
the
trenches
on
our
left
some
of
our
men
continued
the
volley
firing
but
a
few
of
our
crack
shots
were
told
off
for
independent
firing
they
fell
back
in
confusion
and
then
lay
down
wherever
cover
was
available
we
gave
them
no
rest
and
soon
they
were
on
the
move
again
in
flight
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
through
the
whole
day
from
another
view
we
gather
that
we
were
in
the
trenches
waiting
for
them
but
we
did
expect
anything
like
the
smashing
blow
that
struck
us
all
at
once
so
it
seemed
the
sky
began
to
rain
down
bullets
and
shells
at
first
they
went
wide
but
after
a
time
they
got
our
range
and
then
they
fairly
mopped
us
up
i
saw
many
a
good
comrade
go
out
during
the
early
part
of
the
battle
von
kluck
directed
his
main
attack
upon
the
british
right
with
a
furious
artillery
bombardment
of
binche
and
bray
this
was
coincident
with
the
crumpling
of
the
french
right
at
charleroi
by
the
army
of
von
bülow
and
its
threatened
retreat
by
that
of
von

the
retirement
of
the
french
fifth
army
therefore
left
general
haig
exposed
to
a
strong

conveyed

news
to

french
not
only
that
the
french
fifth

had
been
defeated
and
was
in
retreat
the
first
intimation
even
that
the

at

under

was
in
peril
but
that
at

three

were

doubtless
the
german
smashing
of
general
planned
grand
counterattack
after

were

was
disheartening

as

a

dealing
with
the
combined
action
of
the
french
and
british
in
this
critical
period
a
french
military
writer
says
the
french
armies
of
the
center
that
is
to
say
the
third
and
fourth
armies
had
as
their
mission
the
duty
of
attacking
the
german
army
in
belgian
luxembourg
of
attempting
to
put
it
to
flight
and
of
crumpling
it
up
against
the
left
flank
of
the
german
main
body
at
the
north
this
offensive
on
the
part
of
the
french
center
began
on
august
the
third
army
general
ruffey
followed
from
the
east
to
the
west
the
course
of
the
semoy
a
tributary
on
the
right
of
the
meuse
the
fourth
army
operated
between
the
meuse
and
the
lesse
the
germans
occupied
the
plateau
which
extends
from
neufchâteau
to
paliseul
it
is
uncertain
territory
covered
with
heaths
and
thick
woods
and
lends
itself
poorly
to
the
reconnaissance
work
of
aviators
or
cavalry
patrols
there
are
no
targets
for
the
artillery
the
germans
had
strongly
fortified
the
ground
the
infantry
of
the
fourth
army
which
hurled
itself
against
these
positions
was
thrown
hack
still
fighting
it
fell
back
over
the
meuse
the
pursuit
by
the
germans
was
punctuated
by
strong
counterattacks
which
inflicted
great
losses
on
them
the
third
army
was
similarly
checked
in
its
march
on
neufchâteau
by
the
superior
forces
of
the
crown
prince
and
was
thrown
back
on
the
semoy
thus
the
offensive
actions
undertaken
by
the
armies
of
the
french
center
miscarried
not
only
were
they
unable
to
lend
their
aid
to
the
armies
of
the
left
but
they
saw
themselves
obliged
to
retreat
the
situation
could
only
be
reestablished
by
a
victory
on
the
part
of
the
fifth
french
army
operating
in
conjunction
with
the
army
of
general
french
this
army
however
found
itself
in

most
an

a

stretched
for
some
two
hundred
miles
close

extending
from

the
position
of
the

armies
was
based
on
the
resisting
power
of
namur
it
was
expected
that
namur
would
delay
the
german
advance
as
long
as
liege
had
done
then
the
french
line
of
frontier
fortresses
lille
with
its
defenses
maubeuge
with
strong
forts
and
a
large
garrison
and

strongholds
would
form
a
still
more
useful
system
of
fortified
points
for
the
allies
the
german
staff
however
had
other
plans
at
liege
they
had
rashly
endeavored
to
storm
a
strong
fortress
by
a
massed
infantry
attack
which
had
failed
disastrously
until
their
new
krupp
siege
guns
had
been
brought
up
these
quickly
demolished
the
defenses
these
siege
guns
therefore
which
had
thus
fully
demonstrated
their
value
against
fortifications
soon
brought
about
the
total
defeat
of
the
french
offensive
and
compelled
the
allies
to
retreat
from
belgium
and
northern
france
the
germans
lost
no
time
in
investing
namur
and
on
saturday
as

the

fell
into
the

hands
on

town
of
solesmes
extending
to
the
south
of
cambrai
thus
placed
this
force
could
shield
the
second
corps
now
beginning
its
retreat
under
pressure
of
the
german
army
advancing
from
tournai
these
troops
under
general
snow
were
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
impending
battle
of
le
cateau
by
sunrise
the
guns
of
the
four
german
corps
were
firing
from
positions
facing
the
british
left
and
masses
of
infantry
were
pressing
forward
in
dense
firing
lines
in
view
of
this
attack
general
judged
it
impossible
to
continue
his
retreat
at
daybreak
the
first
corps
was
at
that
moment
scarcely
out
of
difficulty
and
general
sordêt
whose
troops
had
been
fighting
hard
on
the
flank
of
the
fifth
french
army
with
general
lanrezac
against
general
von
bülow
hosts
was
unable
to
help
the
british
owing
to
the
exhausted
state
of
his
cavalry
the
situation
was
full
of
peril
indeed
wednesday
bade
fair
to
become
the
most
critical
day
of
the
retreat
as
the
day
of
august
wore
on
general
von
kluck
abandoning
frontal
attacks
began
to
use
his
superior
numbers
in
a
great
enveloping
move
on
both
flanks
and
some
of
his
batteries
secured
positions
from
which
they
could
enfilade
the
british
line
having
no
available
reserves
was
thus
virtually
ringed
by
enemy
guns
on
one
side
and
by
hostile
infantry
on
all
sides
it
became
apparent
says
sir
john
french
dispatch
that
if
complete
annihilation
was
to
be
avoided
a
retirement
must
be
attempted
and
the
order
was
given
to
commence
it
about
the
movement
was
covered
with
the
most
devoted
intrepidity
and
determination
by
the
artillery
which
had
suffered
heavily
and
the
fine
work
done
by
the
cavalry
in
the
farther
retreat
from
the
position
assisted
materially
in
the
completion
of
this
difficult
and
dangerous
operation
the
saving
of
the
left
wing
could
never
have
been
accomplished
unless
a
commander
sir
horace
of
rare
coolness
had
been
present
to
personally
conduct
the
operation
this
retirement
foreshadowed
the
end
of
the
battle
worn
out
by
repeated
repulses
the
germans
had
suffered
too
heavily
to
continue
their
attacks
or
to
engage
in
an
energetic
pursuit
according
to
general
french
estimate
the
british
losses
during
the
trying
period
from
august
to
august
inclusive
were
between
and
men
and
the
losses
suffered
by
the
germans
in
their
pursuit
and
attacks
across
the
open
country
owing
largely
to
their
dense
formation
were
much
greater
the
battle
of
le
cateau
gave
the
germans
pause
further
retreat
of
the
british
could
now
be
resumed
in
orderly
array
for
by
now
general
sordêt
with
his
cavalry
was
relieving
the
pressure
on
the
british
rear
and
general
with
his
two
reserve
divisions
from
the
neighborhood
of
arras
was
attacking
general
von
kluck
right
driving
it
back
on
cambrai
disaster
to
the
british
forces
was
averted
though
the
peril
of
german
interposition
between
the
allied
army
and
paris
would
soon
compel
still
further
withdrawals
covered
by
their
gunners
but
still
under
heavy
fire
of
the
german
artillery
the
british
began
again
to
retire
southward
their
retreat
was
continued
far
into
the
night
of
august
and
through
the
and
on
the
last
date
after
vigorous
cavalry
fighting
the
exhausted
troops
halted
on
a
line
extending
from
the
french
cathedral
town
of
noyon
through
chauny
to
la
fère
there
they
were
joined
by
reenforcements
amounting
to
double
their
loss
guns
to
replace
those
captured
or
shattered
by
the
enemy
were
brought
up
to
the
new
line
there
was
a
breathing
space
for
a
day
while
the
british
made
ready
to
take
part
in
the
next
great
encounter
this
fourth
week
in
august
marked
a
decisive
period
in
the
history
of
the
great
war
all
the
french
armies
from
the
east
to
the
west
as
well
as
the
british
army
were
in
retreat
over
their
frontiers
to
what
resolution
had
the
french
commander
in
chief
come
that
was
the
question
on
every
lip
what
at
that
moment
was
the
real
situation
of
the
french
army
certainly
the
first
engagements
had
not
turned
out
as
well
as
the
french
could
have
hoped
the
germans
were
reaping
the
reward
of
their
magnificent
preparation
for
the
war
their
heavy
artillery
with
which
the
french
army
was
almost
entirely
unprovided
was
giving
proof
of
its
efficacy
and
its
worth
the
moral
effect
of
those
great
projectiles
launched
from
great
distances
by
the
immense
german
guns
was
considerable
at
such
great
distances
the
french
cannons
of
admirable
as
they
were
could
make
no
effective
reply
to
the
german
batteries
the
french
soldiers
were
perfectly
well
aware
that
they
were
the
targets
of
the
great
german
shells
while
their
own
cannon
could
make
no
parallel
impression
on
the
enemy
the
german
army
revealed
itself
as
an
extraordinary
instrument
of
war
its
mobility
and
accouterments
were
perfect
it
had
aver
a
hundred
thousand
professional
officers
or
subofficers
admirably
suited
to
their
work
with
their
men
marching
under
the
control
of
their
eye
and
finger
in
the
german
army
the
active
corps
as
well
as
the
reserve
carps
showed
themselves
thanks
to
these
noncommissioned
officers
marvelously
equipped
in
the
french
army
the
number
of
noncommissioned
officers
by
profession
totaled
hardly
half
the
german
figures
the
german
army
moreover
was
much
more
abundantly
supplied
with
machine
guns
than
the
french
the
germans
had
almost
twice
as
many
and
they
understood
how
to
use
them
in
defense
and
attack
better
than
the
french
they
had
moreover
to
a
degree
far
superior
to
that
of
the
french
studied
the
use
of
fortifications
in
the
field
trenches
wire
entanglements
and
so
on
the
germans
were
also
at
first
better
trained
than
the
french
reservists
they
had
spent
langer
periods
in
the
german
army
and
their
reserve
carps
were
almost
equal
to
the
active
carps
in
the
french
army
on
the
other
hand
an
apprenticeship
and
training
of
several
weeks
were
required
to
give
to
the
divisions
of
reserve
their
full
worth
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
nevertheless
thanks
to
the
marvelous
elasticity
of
the
french
soldier
and
the
warlike
qualities
of
the
race
the
training
was
completed
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
september
the
reserve
divisions
fought
with
the
same
skill
the
same
keenness
and
the
same
swing
as
the
active
army
carps
moreover
certain
incompetencies
had
revealed
themselves
in
the
french
high
command
these
general
jaffre
attended
to
without
the
loss
of
an
instant
every
general
that
appeared
to
him
incapable
of
fulfilling
the
task
allotted
to
him
was
weeded
out
on
the
spot
without
considering
friendships
or
the
bonds
of
comradeship
or
intimacy
that
might
be
between
them
as
things
were
seen
in
paris
all
may
be
summed
up
in
this
formula
that
the
german
army
was
better
prepared
for
war
than
the
french
army
for
the
simple
reason
that
germany
had
long
prepared
for
the
war
because
she
had
it
in
view
a
thing
which
could
not
be
said
of
france
but
the
french
army
revealed
right
from
the
beginning
the
most
admirable
and
marvelous
qualities
the
soldiers
fought
with
a
skill
and
heroism
that
have
never
been
equaled
sometimes
indeed
their
enthusiasm
and
courage
carried
them
too
far
it
mattered
little
in
spite
of
losses
in
spite
even
of
retreat
the
morale
of
the
whole
french
army
on
the
entire
front
from
alsace
to
the
somme
remained
extraordinarily
high
the
violation
of
belgian
neutrality
and
the
passage
of
the
german
armies
through
belgium
had
been
foreseen
by
the
french
general
staff
but
opinions
differed
in
regard
to
the
breadth
of
the
turning
movement
likely
to
be
made
by
the
german
right
wing
in
crossing
belgian
territory
among
french
experts
some
were
of
opinion
that
the
germans
would
confine
themselves
to
the
right
bank
of
the
meuse
while
others
thought
that
they
would
cross
the
meuse
and
make
a
much
vaster
turning
movement
thus
descending
on
france
in
a
direction
due
north
and
south
if
the
violation
of
belgian
neutrality
was
no
surprise
to
the
french
staff
it
was
nevertheless
hardly
expected
that
the
germans
would
be
able
to
put
in
line
with
such
rapidity
at
the
outset
all
their
reserve
formations
each
army
corps
was
supported
by
its
reserve
corps
which
showed
itself
as
quick
in
mobilization
and
preparation
as
the
active
corps
germany
while
maintaining
sufficient
forces
on
the
russian
front
was
still
able
to
put
in
the
field
for
its
great
offensive
against
france
a
more
numerous
body
of
troops
than
would
have
been
believed
in
france
this
permitted
them
to
maintain
in
alsace
in
lorraine
and
in
belgian
luxembourg
armies
as
numerous
as
those
which
faced
them
on
the
french
side
and
at
the
same
time
to
mass
the
major
part
of
their
troops
on
the
right
so
as
to
pour
into
the
valley
of
the
oise
their
chief
invading
forces
this
explains
why
the
french
left
which
was
exposed
to
the
offensive
of
the
german
right
was
obliged
to
make
a
rapid
retreat
permitting
the
german
armies
of
general
von
kluck
and
general
von
bülow
to
advance
with
all
speed
in
the
direction
of
paris
the
french
military
staff
as
soon
as
they
perceived
the
danger
that
threatened
proceeded
to
a
new
alignment
of
forces
as
long
as
this
alignment
of
forces
could
not
be
effected
the
retreat
had
to
continue
as
soon
as
it
was
accomplished
as
soon
as
general
joffre
had
his
armies
well
in
hand
and
the
situation
of
his
troops
well
disposed
he
checked
the
retreat
gave
the
signal
for
the
offensive
and
so
followed
the
great
battle
of
the
marne
the
german
plan
consisted
therefore
in
delivering
the
main
blow
through
the
medium
of
the
right
wing
of
the
german
forces
consisting
of
the
army
of
von
kluck
the
army
of
von
bülow
and
the
army
of
von
hausen
which
were
to
march
with
all
speed
in
the
direction
of
paris
what
plan
had
the
french
staff
in
mind
to
oppose
to
this
plan
of
the
germans
its
plan
aimed
at
checking
and
holding
the
greatest
possible
number
of
germans
by
a
vigorous
offensive
in
alsace
and
lorraine
so
as
to
prevent
them
from
joining
the
three
first
german
armies
which
threatened
paris
in
support
of
this
offensive
of
the
armies
of
alsace
and
lorraine
the
central
french
armies
attacked
in
the
direction
of
the
ardennes
and
belgian
luxembourg
with
the
object
of
checking
the
center
of
the
german
armies
and
then
turning
toward
the
west
so
as
to
cooperate
in
the
offensive
of
the
french
forces
which
aided
by
the
british
army
and
the
belgian
army
were
fighting
in
belgium
the
french
armies
which
are
numbered
from
the
right
to
the
left
that
is
from
the
east
to
the
west
comprised
a
detachment
of
the
army
of
alsace
that
was
dissolved
toward
the
end
of
the
month
of
august
the
first
army
general
dubail
the
second
army
general
de
castelnau
the
third
army
general
ruffey
replaced
at
the
end
of
august
by
general
sarrail
the
fourth
army
general
de
langle
de
cary
the
fifth
army
general
lanrezac
replaced
in
the
last
days
of
august
by
general
franche
at
the
right
of
this
army
was
stationed
the
british
army
under
the
command
of
general
french
to
what
resolution
did
general
joffre
come
on
that
memorable
evening
of
the
and
on
that
morning
of
the
two
alternatives
presented
themselves
before
him
should
they
rather
than
permit
the
enemy
to
invade
the
soil
of
france
make
a
supreme
effort
to
check
the
germans
on
the
frontier
this
first
apparent
solution
had
the
evident
advantage
of
abandoning
to
the
enemy
no
part
of
the
national
soil
but
it
had
some
serious
inconveniences
the
attack
of
the
german
armies
operating
on
the
right
generals
von
kluck
von
bülow
von
hausen
were
extremely
menacing
in
order
to
parry
this
attack
it
was
necessary
considerably
to
reenforce
the
french
left
and
for
that
purpose
to
transfer
from
the
right
to
the
left
a
certain
number
of
army
corps
that
is
what
the
military
call
in
the
language
of
chess
players
to
castle
the
army
corps
but
this
movement
could
not
be
accomplished
in
a
few
hours
it
required
even
with
all
the
perfection
of
organization
shown
by
the
french
railways
during
this
war
a
certain
number
of
days
as
long
as
this
operation
from
the
right
to
the
left
had
not
been
accomplished
as
long
as
the
left
wing
of
the
french
army
and
even
the
center
remained
without
the
reenforcement
of
elements
taken
from
the
right
it
would
have
been
extremely
imprudent
not
to
say
rash
for
the
french
high
command
to
attempt
a
decisive
battle
if
general
joffre
had
risked
a
battle
immediately
he
would
have
been
playing
the
game
without
all
his
trumps
in
hand
and
would
have
been
in
danger
of
a
defeat
and
even
of
a
decided
disaster
from
which
it
might
have
been
impossible
to
recover
the
second
alternative
consisted
in
drawing
back
and
in
profiting
from
a
retreat
by
putting
everything
in
shipshape
order
to
bring
about
a
new
grouping
of
forces
they
would
allow
the
germans
to
advance
and
when
the
occasion
showed
itself
favorable
the
french
armies
along
with
the
british
army
would
take
the
offensive
and
wage
a
decisive
battle
it
was
to
this
second
decision
that
general
joffre
came
as
soon
as
on
august
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
the
french
retreat
was
going
to
lead
he
gave
orders
for
a
new
marshaling
of
forces
and
for
preparations
with
a
view
to
the
offensive
general
joffre
has
made
no
objection
to
the
publication
of
his
orders
in
detail
from
that
date
august
down
to
the
battle
of
the
marne
they
constitute
an
eloquent
and
convincing
document
the
series
of
orders
were
contained
in
the
bulletin
des
armées
de
la
république
française
june
sunday
the
first
of
these
orders
dated
august
runs
as
follows
the
projected
offensive
movement
not
having
been
found
possible
of
execution
the
consequent
operations
will
be
so
conducted
as
to
put
in
line
on
our
left
by
the
junction
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
armies
the
british
army
and
new
forces
recruited
from
the
eastern
district
a
body
capable
of
taking
the
offensive
while
other
armies
for
the
needed
interval
hold
in
check
the
efforts
of
the
enemy
the
retreating
movement
was
regulated
so
as
to
bring
about
the
following
disposition
of
forces
preparatory
to
an
offensive
in
the
amiens
district
a
new
grouping
of
forces
formed
of
elements
conveyed
by
rail
seventh
corps
four
divisions
of
reserve
and
perhaps
another
active
army
corps
brought
together
from
august
to
september
this
body
will
remain
ready
to
take
the
offensive
in
the
general
direction
of
or
the
same
general
instructions
of
august
marks
out
the
zones
of
march
and
says
the
movement
will
be
covered
by
the
rear
guards
spread
out
at
favorable
points
of
vantage
so
as
to
utilize
every
obstacle
for
the
purpose
of
checking
by
brief
and
violent
counterattacks
in
which
the
artillery
will
play
the
chief
part
the
march
of
the
enemy
or
at
least
to
retard
it
signed
joffre
the
object
of
this
maneuver
is
thus
already
on
august
clearly
indicated
it
looked
not
to
a
defensive
but
to
an
offensive
movement
which
was
to
be
resumed
as
soon
as
circumstances
appeared
favorable
much
is
made
clear
in
these
orders
of
general
joffre
which
are
characterized
by
perspicuity
foresight
and
precision
the
retreat
was
effected
but
it
was
only
a
provisional
retreat
whenever
an
occasion
presented
itself
to
counterattack
the
enemy
for
the
purpose
of
delaying
his
advance
that
occasion
was
to
be
taken
advantage
of
and
that
is
in
fact
what
took
place
two
days
later
on
august
general
joffre
brought
together
using
army
corps
and
divisions
recruited
elsewhere
a
supplementary
army
the
ninth
army
which
was
detailed
to
take
its
place
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
armies
he
intrusted
its
command
to
a
general
who
while
commanding
the
twentieth
corps
had
distinguished
himself
by
his
brilliant
conduct
in
lorraine
general
foch
the
establishment
of
the
army
of
manoury
on
the
left
of
the
french
armies
so
as
to
fall
on
the
right
flank
of
the
germans
when
they
marched
on
paris
the
establishment
of
a
strong
army
under
one
of
the
best
french
generals
at
the
center
for
the
purpose
of
encountering
the
main
weight
of
the
german
army
such
were
the
two
decisions
of
the
french
commander
in
chief
taken
on
august
and
which
contained
in
germ
the
victory
of
the
marne
waged
and
won
two
weeks
later
chapter
xi
fighting
at
bay
the
forces
of
france
also
had
been
fighting
to
protect
their
retreat
southward
in
these
august
days
of
after
the
passages
of
the
sambre
were
forced
during
the
great
battle
the
fifth
french
army
was
placed
in
very
perilous
straits
by
the
failure
of
the
fourth
army
under
general
langle
to
hold
the
belgian
river
town
of
givet
hard
pressed
in
the
rear
by
general
von
army
and
on
their
right
by
general
von
hausen
commanding
the
saxon
army
and
the
prussian
guard
the
fifth
army
of
france
had
to
retire
with
all
possible
speed
for
their
path
of
retreat
was
threatened
by
a
large
body
of
teutons
advancing
on
rocroi
on
august
holding
their
indomitable
pursuers
in
check
by
desperate
action
with
their
two
cavalry
divisions
under
general
sordêt
galloping
furiously
along
the
lines
of
the
western
flank
to
protect
the
retiring
infantry
and
guns
the
fifth
army
unexpectedly
turned
at
guise
at
that
point
considerable
reenforcements
in
troops
and
material
arrived
making
the
fifth
army
the
strongest
in
france
it
now
defeated
and
drove
over
the
oise
the
german
guard
and
tenth
corps
and
then
continued
its
retirement
but
the
left
wing
of
the
french
army
was
unsuccessful
and
amiens
and
the
passages
of
the
somme
had
to
be
abandoned
to
the
invaders
on
sunday
august
the
fourth
army
operating
from
the
meuse
was
heavily
outnumbered
by
the
saxon
army
around
the
river
town
of
dinant
they
fell
back
after
furious
fighting
for
the
possession
of
the
bridges
which
the
french
engineers
blew
up
as
the
army
withdrew
southward
to
the
frontier
soon
after
at
givet
the
germans
succeeded
in
wedging
their
way
across
the
meuse
some
advanced
on
rocroi
and
rethel
and
other
corps
marched
along
the
left
bank
of
the
meuse
through
wooded
country
against
a
steadily
increasing
resistance
which
culminated
at
charleville
a
town
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
there
a
determined
stand
was
made
on
august
the
town
of
charleville
was
evacuated
the
civilians
were
sent
away
to
join
multitudes
of
other
homeless
refugees
and
then
the
french
also
retired
leaving
behind
them
several
machine
guns
hidden
in
houses
placed
so
that
they
commanded
the
town
and
the
three
bridges
that
connected
it
with
mézières
the
german
advance
guards
reached
the
two
towns
next
day
august
which
as
we
know
witnessed
the
british
retirement
toward
le
cateau
unmolested
they
rode
across
the
three
bridges
into
the
quiet
empty
streets
suddenly
when
all
had
crossed
the
bridges
were
blown
up
behind
them
by
contact
mines
and
the
german
cavalrymen
were
raked
by
the
deadly
fire
of
the
machine
guns
nevertheless
finding
their
foes
were
not
numerous
they
made
a
courageous
stand
waiting
for
their
main
columns
to
draw
nearer
every
french
machine
gunner
was
silenced
by
the
guards
with
their
maxims
but
when
the
main
invading
army
swept
into
view
along
the
river
valley
the
french
artillery
from
the
hills
around
charleville
mowed
down
the
heads
of
columns
with
shrapnel
still
the
teutons
advanced
with
reckless
courage
while
their
artillery
was
engaged
in
a
duel
with
the
french
german
sappers
threw
pontoon
bridges
across
the
river
and
finally
the
french
had
to
retire
between
charleville
and
rethel
there
was
another
battle
resulting
in
the
abandonment
of
mézières
by
the
french
the
retreating
army
crossed
the
semois
a
tributary
of
the
meuse
which
it
enters
below
mézières
and
advanced
toward
neufchâteau
but
they
were
repulsed
by
the
germans
under
the
duke
of
württemberg
at
nancy
on
august
there
was
another
engagement
between
the
garrison
of
toul
and
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
of
bavaria
after
fierce
onslaughts
the
garrison
was
compelled
to
yield
and
retire
finally
on
august
at
longwy
a
fortified
town
near
verdun
the
army
of
the
german
crown
prince
succeeded
in
bursting
into
france
after
a
long
siege
and
marched
toward
the
argonne
thus
from
the
western
coast
almost
to
verdun
there
was
a
general
retreat
on
august
pressed
by
the
german
armies
commanded
by
von
kluck
on
the
west
by
von
hausen
from
dinant
and
givet
by
von
bülow
from
charleroi
and
namur
the
allies
were
pushed
back
upon
a
line
stretching
roughly
from
amiens
through
fère
to
mézières
while
their
forces
east
of
the
meuse
between
mézières
and
verdun
were
retreating
before
duke
albrecht
of
württemberg
and
to
the
southeast
of
verdun
before
the
bavarians
all
northern
france
was
thus
open
to
the
invaders
after
the
battle
of
le
cateau
however
the
germans
slackened
their
pursuit
for
a
very
brief
interval
partly
because
the
terrific
strain
of
marching
and
fighting
was
telling
upon
them
no
less
than
upon
the
allies
partly
because
the
engineers
had
blown
up
the
bridges
over
every
river
canal
and
stream
behind
the
retreating
armies
and
partly
because
under
directions
from
the
french
commander
in
chief
general
manoury
was
organizing
a
new
force
on
the
british
left
a
new
sixth
army
mainly
reserve
troops
one
corps
of
line
troops
and
general
sordêt
cavalry
on
the
right
of
the
british
were
general
lanrezac
troops
then
between
lanrezac
fifth
army
and
the
fourth
army
came
a
ninth
army
under
general
foch
formed
of
three
corps
from
the
south
counterattacks
were
ordered
by
the
french
general
in
chief
continued
during
the
entire
retreat
and
had
frequently
brilliant
results
on
august
a
corps
of
the
fifth
army
and
of
the
divisions
of
reserve
attacked
with
success
in
the
direction
of
quentin
with
the
object
of
withdrawing
the
pressure
on
the
british
army
two
other
corps
and
a
division
of
reserves
joined
issue
with
the
prussian
guard
and
the
tenth
corps
of
the
german
army
which
debouched
from
guise
this
was
a
very
violent
battle
known
under
the
name
of
the
battle
of
guise
at
the
end
of
the
day
after
various
fluctuations
in
the
fight
the
germans
were
thrown
completely
over
the
oise
and
the
entire
british
front
was
relieved
the
prussian
guard
on
that
occasion
suffered
great
losses
august
the
fourth
army
under
general
de
langle
de
cary
succeeded
likewise
in
throwing
the
enemy
across
the
meuse
as
he
endeavored
to
secure
a
footing
on
the
left
bank
the
success
continued
on
the
on
that
day
a
division
of
this
army
first
division
of
morocco
under
the
orders
of
general
humbert
inflicted
a
sanguinary
defeat
on
a
saxon
army
corps
in
the
region
of
signy
thanks
to
these
brilliant
successes
the
retreat
was
accomplished
in
good
order
and
without
the
french
armies
being
seriously
demoralized
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
actually
put
to
flight
at
no
point
all
the
french
armies
were
thus
found
intact
and
prepared
for
the
offensive
the
right
wing
of
the
german
army
marched
in
the
direction
of
paris
at
great
speed
and
the
rapidity
of
the
german
onslaught
obliged
the
french
general
staff
to
prolong
the
retreat
until
they
were
able
to
establish
a
new
alignment
of
forces
the
new
army
established
on
the
left
of
the
french
armies
and
intrusted
to
general
manoury
was
not
able
to
complete
its
concentration
in
the
localities
first
intended
in
place
of
concentrating
in
the
region
of
amiens
it
was
obliged
to
operate
more
to
the
south
the
situation
on
the
evening
of
september
as
a
result
of
the
vigorous
onward
march
of
the
german
right
was
as
follows
a
corps
of
german
cavalry
had
crossed
the
oise
and
had
reached
château
thierry
the
first
german
army
general
von
kluck
consisting
of
four
active
army
corps
and
a
reserve
corps
had
passed
compiègne
the
second
army
general
von
bülow
with
three
active
army
corps
and
two
reserve
corps
had
attained
to
the
region
of
laon
the
third
german
army
general
van
hausen
with
two
active
army
corps
and
a
reserve
corps
had
crossed
the
aisne
and
reached
château
farther
to
the
east
the
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
german
armies
making
about
twelve
active
army
corps
four
reserve
corps
and
numerous
ersatz
companies
were
in
contact
with
the
french
troops
fourth
and
fifth
armies
between
vouziers
and
verdun
the
others
from
verdun
to
the
vosges
such
was
the
situation
it
may
be
seen
if
a
map
is
consulted
that
the
fifth
french
army
commanded
from
august
by
general
franchet
would
have
found
itself
in
grave
peril
following
on
the
backward
bending
of
the
british
and
french
forces
operating
on
its
left
if
the
french
had
accepted
the
challenge
of
a
decisive
battle
the
french
commander
in
chief
resolutely
chose
the
alternative
that
obviated
such
a
risk
that
is
he
decided
on
a
postponement
of
the
offensive
and
the
continuation
of
the
retreat
already
on
september
he
prescribed
as
the
extreme
limits
of
the
retreat
the
line
running
through
and
the
region
north
of
that
line
would
have
been
reached
had
it
been
necessary
on
the
other
hand
it
was
his
intention
to
attack
before
it
was
reached
if
the
forces
could
be
offensively
arrayed
allowing
of
the
cooperation
of
the
british
army
and
the
army
of
manoury
on
the
left
and
on
the
right
that
of
the
divisions
of
reserve
that
had
been
held
on
the
heights
of
the
meuse
meanwhile
late
in
the
afternoon
of
august
the
british
retirement
began
afresh
and
french
troops
also
withdrew
from
the
somme
blowing
up
the
bridges
as
they
went
everywhere
along
the
roads
were
crowds
of
country
folk
and
villagers
with
wagons
and
carts
piled
high
with
household
goods
or
carrying
aged
persons
and
children
all
in
panic
flight
before
the
dreaded
invaders
fleeing
for
refuge
in
paris
at
various
places
these
stricken
multitudes
joined
the
army
ambulances
taking
the
shortest
routes
rumors
of
the
coming
of
the
uhlans
ran
along
the
straggling
lines
with
tales
of
the
grievous
havoc
and
ruin
which
these
horsemen
vanguards
of
the
german
columns
had
wrought
in
the
land
hardly
had
the
retirement
begun
when
a
body
of
uhlans
entered
amiens
and
demanded
from
the
mayor
the
surrender
of
the
town
this
was
formally
given
and
the
civilians
were
ordered
on
pain
of
death
not
to
create
the
slightest
disturbance
and
not
to
take
part
in
any
action
overt
or
covert
against
the
soldiery
afterward
cavalry
infantry
and
artillery
took
possession
of
the
town
on
august
on
the
same
day
a
german
aeroplane
dropped
bombs
on
paris
while
retiring
from
the
thickly
wooded
country
south
of
compiègne
the
british
first
cavalry
brigade
were
surprised
while
dismounted
and
at
breakfast
in
the
early
morning
of
september
moving
figures
on
the
distant
skyline
first
attracted
the
attention
of
those
who
had
field
glasses
but
in
the
dim
light
their
identity
was
not
at
first
revealed
suddenly
all
doubt
was
resolved
by
a
rain
of
shells
on
the
camp
many
men
and
a
large
number
of
horses
were
killed
at
once
the
order
action
front
rang
out
and
the
remaining
horses
five
to
a
man
were
hurried
to
cover
in
the
rear
while
on
the
left
a
battery
of
horse
artillery
went
into
instant
action
the
german
attack
was
pressed
hard
and
the
battery
was
momentarily
lost
until
some
detachments
from
the
british
third
corps
with
the
guns
of
the
artillery
brigade
galloped
up
to
its
support
then
they
not
only
recovered
their
own
guns
but
also
succeeded
in
capturing
twelve
of
the
enemy
on
the
eventful
day
of
september
the
british
forces
reached
a
position
south
of
the
marne
between
lagny
and
they
had
defended
the
passage
of
the
river
against
the
german
armies
as
long
as
possible
and
had
destroyed
bridges
in
the
path
of
the
pursuers
next
at
general
joffre
request
they
retired
some
twelve
miles
farther
southward
with
a
view
to
taking
a
position
behind
the
seine
in
the
meantime
the
germans
had
built
pontoon
bridges
across
the
marne
and
were
threatening
the
allies
all
along
the
line
of
the
british
forces
and
the
fifth
and
ninth
french
armies
consequently
several
outpost
actions
took
place
by
the
of
september
the
day
of
the
russian
victories
at
lemberg
von
kluck
army
had
reached
senlis
only
miles
from
paris
despite
this
imminent
danger
the
capital
was
remarkably
quiet
and
calm
every
day
as
fateful
event
crowded
upon
event
seemed
to
renew
the
resolution
and
coolness
of
the
population
it
seemed
advisable
however
to
transfer
the
seat
of
government
for
the
time
being
from
paris
to
bordeaux
after
assuring
the
defense
of
the
city
by
every
means
that
could
be
devised
the
defenses
of
paris
consisted
of
three
great
intrenched
camps
on
the
north
east
and
southwest
respectively
of
these
the
most
important
is
the
last
which
includes
all
the
fortified
area
to
the
south
and
west
of
the
seine
a
railway
over
sixty
miles
in
length
connects
all
the
works
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
forts
it
could
not
only
keep
them
supplied
with
the
necessary
ammunition
and
stores
but
also
it
could
be
utilized
to
convey
troops
from
point
to
point
as
they
might
be
needed
however
it
was
an
open
secret
that
even
the
outer
and
newer
defenses
were
not
of
any
great
strength
if
the
germans
broke
through
the
outlying
circle
of
forts
the
inner
line
would
be
of
small
value
and
the
city
itself
would
be
exposed
to
bombardment
paris
was
not
ready
for
a
siege
and
if
attacked
it
would
speedily

did
what

could
to

were
constructed
and
hundreds
of

that
had

allowed
to
spring
up
over

were
demolished
in
order
to
leave

the
gates
of

city
were
barred
with
heavy
palisades
backed
by
sandbags
and
neighboring
streets
also
were
barricaded
for
fighting
certain
strategic
streets
were
obstructed
by
networks
of
barbed
wire
and
in
others
pits
were
dug
to
the
depth
of

the

buildings
were
barricaded
with

while

the
french

were
concentrating
their

on
making

impossible
by

hardly
had

arrived
that

had
swung
southeastward

day
under
the
swinging
blows
of
the
german
drive
the
flower
of
the
forces
of
the
allies
had
been
compelled
to
break
a
little
less
generalship
on
the
part
of
the
defenders
or
a
little
more
recklessness
behind
that
smashing
offensive
might
have
turned
this
retirement
into
a
rout
even
as
it
was
the
official
dispatches
reveal
that
while
occasional
and
local
retirements
had
been
considered
such
a
sweeping
retreat
was
far
from
contemplated
by
generals
joffre
and
french
german
official
dispatches
bear
testimony
to
the
intrepid
character
of
the
defenders
sullenly
falling
back
and
contesting
every
inch
of
the
way
as
much
as
they
do
to
the
daring
and
the
vivid
bravery
of
the
german
attackers
who
hurled
themselves
steadily
day
after
day
upon
positions
hastily
taken
up
in
the
retreat
where
the
retirement
could
be
partly
repaid
by
the
heaviest
toll
of
death
the
great
strategical
plan
of
the
germans
which
had
displayed
itself
throughout
the
entire
operations
on
the
western
theatre
of
war
from
the
very
first
gun
of
the
campaign
came
to
its
apex
on
this
september
if
the
allied
armies
could
develop
a
strong
enough
defense
to
halt
the
german
offensive
at
this
point
and
especially
if
they
could
develop
a
sufficiently
powerful
counteroffensive
to
strike
doubt
into
the
confident
expectations
of
the
armies
of
the
central
powers
then
the
strategical
plan
had
reached
a
check
which
might
or
might
not
be
a
checkmate
as
the
fortunes
of
war
might
determine
if
on
the
other
hand
the
stand
made
by
the
allies
at
this
point
should
prove
ineffective
and
if
the
counteroffensive
should
reveal
that
the
german
hosts
had
been
able
to
establish
impregnable
defenses
as
they
marched
then
the
original
strategic
plan
of
the
attackers
must
be
considered
as
intact
and
the
peril
of
france
would
become
greatly
intensified
it
is
idle
in
a
war
of
such
astounding
magnitude
to
speak
about
any
one
single
incident
as
being
a
decisive
one
such
a
term
can
only
rightly
be
applied
to
conditions
where
the
opposing
powers
each
have
but
one
organized
army
in
the
field
and
these
armies
meet
in
a
pitched
battle
none
the
less
the
several
actions
which
are
known
as
the
battles
of
the
marne
may
be
considered
as
decisive
to
the
extent
that
they
decided
the
limit
of
the
german
offensive
at
that
point
the
german
general
staff
taking
the
ordinary
and
obvious
precautions
in
the
case
of
a
possible
repulse
chose
and
fortified
in
the
german
rear
positions
to
which
its
forces
might
fall
back
in
the
event
of
retreat
these
prepared
positions
had
a
secondary
contingent
value
for
the
germans
in
view
of
the
grave
russian
menace
that
might
call
at
any
moment
for
a
transfer
of
german
troops
from
the
western
to
the
eastern
front
the
battle
of

the
advance
of
the
main
german

line
forcing
it
back
illustration
battle
of
the
marne
beginning
on
september
the
scene
of
the
battle
ground
is
one
of
the
most
famous
in
europe
not
even
the
plains
of
belgium
possessing
a
richer
historical
significance
than
that
melancholy
plain
the
upon
whose
inhospitable
flats
rested
for
centuries
the
curse
of
a
prophecy
that
there
would
the
fate
of
france
be
decided
a
prophecy
of
rare
connotation
of
accuracy
for
it
refrained
from
stating
what
that
fate
should
be
yet
the
historic
sense
is
amplified
even
more
by
remembrance
than
by
prophecy
for
in
the
territory
confronting
that
huge
arc
on
which
german
and
austrian
soldiers
lay
encamped
awaiting
what
even
the
german
generals
declared
to
be
the
great
decision
there
lies
on
the
old
roman
road
running
from
chalons
a
vast
oval
mound
known
to
tradition
as
the
camp

that
country

those
savage
mongol
hordes
hurled
themselves
against
westernmost
possession
on
that
occasion
however
the
visigoths
under
their
king

fought
side

side
with
the
gauls
then
the
dwellers
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
on
the
banks
of
the

were
brothers
in
arms
now
that

countryside
shall
see
them
locked
in
deadly
conflict
the
morale
of
tradition
is
a
curious
thing
and
often
will
nerve
a
sword
arm
when
the
most
impassioned
utterance
of
a
beloved
leader
may
fail
there
were
few
among
the
soldiers
of
france
who
forgot
that
in
the
south
of
this

the
home
of
joan

the
maid
of

patriot
and
saint

more
than
one
french
soldier
prayed
that
the
same
voices
which
had
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
virgin
of
domremy
should
guide
the
generalissimo
who
was
to
lead
the
armies
of

in
the
serried
ranks
awaiting
the
awful
test
of
the
shock
of

english
and
french
soldiers
lived
and
slept
as
brothers
the
topography
of
the
region
of
the
battle
field
is
of
more
than
common
interest
for
modern
tactics
deal
with
vaster
stretches
of
country
than
would
have
been
considered
in
any
previous
war
this
is
due
partly
to
the
large
armies
handled
partly
to
the
terrific
range
of
modern
artillery
and
also
to
what
may
be
called
the
territorial
perceptiveness
which
aeronautical
surveys
make
possible
to
a
general
of
while
war
has
not
changed
it
is
true
that
a
commander
of
an
army
in
modern
campaign
is
compelled
to
review
and
to
take
into
account
a
far
larger
group
of
factors
a
modern
general
must
be
capable
of
grasping
increased
complexities
and
must
possess
a
synthetic
mind
to
be
able
to
reduce
all
these
complicating
factors
into
a
single
whole
the
first
factor
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
was
the
topographical
factor
the
consideration
of
the
land
over
which
the
action
was
to
take
place
let
the
river
marne
be
used
as
a
base
from
which
this
topography
can
be
determined
the
marne
rises
near
langres
which
is
the
northwest
angle
of
that
pentagon
of
fortresses
belfort
epinal
langres
dijon
and
besançon
which
incloses
an
almost
impregnable
recuperative
ground
for
exhausted
armies
from
langres
the
marne
flows
almost
north
by
west
for
about
fifty
miles
through
a
hilly
and
wooded
country
then
taking
a
more
westerly
course
it
flows
for
approximately
miles
almost
northwest
across
the
plain
of
champagne
past
and
châlons
thence
almost
due
westward
through
the
plateau
of
sézanne
by
epernay
château
thierry
la
and
meaux
to
join
the
seine
just
south
of
paris
in
the
neighborhood
of
meaux
three
small
tributaries
flow
into
the
marne
the
ourcq
from
the
north
and
the
grand
morin
and
petit
morin
from
the
east
the
marshes
of

ten
miles
long
from
east
to
west
and
a
couple
of
miles
across
lie
toward
the
eastern
borders
of
the
plateau
of
sézanne
and
form
the
source
of
the
petit
morin
which
has
been
deepened
in
the
reclamation
of
the
marsh
country
once
more
considering
the
source
of
the
marne
near
langres
it
will
be
noted
that
the
river
meuse
rises
near
by
flowing
north
by
east
to
toul
and
then
past
verdun
to
sedan
where
it
turns
due
north
flowing
through
the
ardennes
country
to
namur
in
belgium
to
the
east
of
the
meuse
lies
the
difficult
forest
clad
hill
barrier
known
as
the
hills
of
the
meuse
to
the
east
extends
as
far
as
triaucourt
the
craggy
and
broken
wooded
country
of
the
argonne
a
natural
barrier
which
stretches
southward
in
a
chain
of
lakes
and
forests
west
of
this
impassible
country
of
the
meuse
and
the
argonne
lies
the
plain
of
which
is
almost
a
steppe
bare
and
open
only
slightly
undulating
overgrown
with
heath
and
studded
here
and
there
by
small
copses
of
planted
firs
naught
but
a
small
portion
of
the
whole
being
under
cultivation
between
the
forest
of
the
argonne
and
this
great
plain
which
is
over
a
hundred
miles
long
from
north
to
south
and
forty
miles
in
width
lies
a
short
stretch
of
miniature
foothills
with
upland
meadows
here
and
there
but
crossed
in
every
direction
by
small
ravines
filled
with
shrubs
and
low
timber
here
lies
the
source
of
the
aisne
a
river
destined
to
live
in
history
and
on
the
farther
side
begins
the
great
plain
on
the
west
of
the
plain
of
champagne
rises
feet
with
a
curious
clifflike
suddenness
the
plateau
of
sézanne
the
effect
is
as
though
a
geological
fault
had
driven
the
original
plateau
from
north
to
south
throughout
its
entire
length
and
then
as
though
there
had
been
a
general
subsidence
of
the
plain
giving
rise
to
the
clifflike
formations
known
as
les
falaises
de
champagne
at
the
foot
of
which
runs
the
road
from
la
to
rheims
the
disposition
and
arrangement
of
the
german
forces
is
next
to
be
considered
it
can
be
assumed
that
their
objective
was
paris
it
is
also
worthy
of
remembrance
that
the
german
tactical
method
has
always
favored
the
envelopment
of
the
enemy
flanks
rather
than
a
frontal
attack
aiming
to
pierce
the
enemy
center
which
latter
was
a
favorite
method
of
napoleon
i
to
reach
decision
the
tactical
method
of
envelopment
demands
great
numerical
superiority
and
on
account
of
the
extreme
extension
of
front
necessitated
is
apt
to
become
dangerous
as
perforce
the
center
is
left
weak
attempts
to
envelop
with
which
the
observer
is
confronted
again
and
again
when
considering
the
military
movements
of
the
central
powers
on
the
western
battle
front
were
revealed
on
the
morning
of

in
the
position

by
the
german

correspondingly
in
the
arrangement
of
the
allied

the
german
right
on

and

at
which
time
it
was

to
the
banks
of
the
little

the

from

this

comprised
the
second

and
the
fourth

corps
encamped
on
the
western
bank
of
the
little

while
the

was
given
the
honor
of
the

by

and
the

north

these

constituted
the
first
german
army
under
the
command
of
general
von
kluck
the
allies
left
confronting
this
position
held
strong
reserves
and
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
itself
was
well
placed
to
prevent
any
enveloping
movement
dear
to
the
german
school
of
military
tactics
it
rested
securely
on
the
fortress
of
paris
believed
by
its
constructors
to
be
the
most
fully
fortified
city
in
the
world
and
should
the
german
right
endeavor
to
encircle
the
left
wing
of
the
allies
should
it
develop
a
farther
westerly
movement
it
would
but
come
in
contact
with
the
outer
line
of
those
defenses
and
thence
be
deflected
in
such
an
enormous
arc
as
to
thin
the
line
beyond
the
power
of
keeping
it
strong
enough
to
resist
a
piercing
attack
at
all
points
clearly
then
as
long
as
the
extreme
left
of
the

remained
in
contact
with

an
enveloping
movement
was
not
possible
on

easterly
flank

ourcq
valley
encamped
on
the
western
side
of

facing
the
second

fourth
corps
of
the
germans
the
strengthening
of
that
army
from
the
forces
at
paris
was
hourly
and
while
three
or
four
days
before
it
had
been
felt
that
the
sixth
french
army
was
too
weak
to
be
placed
in
so
vital
a
point
that
it
should
have
been
supplemented
with
the
ninth

the
results
justified
the
french
generalissimo
plans
and
more
than
justified
his
confidence
in
the
british

or
expeditionary
force
which
faced
the

it
follows
therefore
that
there
were
about
soldiers
in
all
the
armies
that
confronted
each
other
in
the
week
of
september
of
whom
probably
were
combatants
an
early
estimate
placed
the
german
strength
at
combatants
and
the
allies
at
about
a
later
french
estimate
put
the
germans
at
with
the
allies
between
and
the
preponderance
of
efficiency
of
equipment
lay
with
the
germans
the
plans
of
the
german
campaign
at
this
time
so
far
as
they
can
be
determined
from
the
official
orders
and
from
the
manner
in
which
the
respective
movements
were
carried
out
were
the
first
of
these
movements
was
the
order
given
to
general
von
kluck
to
swirl
his
forces
to
the
southeast
of
paris
swerving
away
from
the
capital
in
an
attempt
to
cut
the
communications
between
it
and
the
fifth
french
army
under
general
this
plan
evidently
involved
a
feint
attack
upon
the
sixth
french
army
under
general
manoury
though
general
pare
took
charge
of
the
larger
issues
of
this
western
campaign
coupled
with
a
swift
southerly
stroke
and
an
attack
upon
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
exposed
western
flank
of
general
army
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
this
attempt
was
the
presence
of
the
british
army
as
has
been
shown
in
the
alignment
of
the
armies
given
above
and
as
will
be
shown
in
detail
later
in
the
recital
of
the
actual
progress
of
the
fighting
important
as
was
this
movement
however
it
was
the
least
of
the
three
elements
in
general
von
moltke
plan
for
the
shattering
of
the
great
defense
line
of
the
allies
the
second
element
in
this
plan
was
contrary
to
germany
usual
tactics
the
determination
to
attack
the
center
of
the
french
line
and
break
through
almost
of
a
million
men
were
concentrated
on
this
point
the
armies
of
general
von
bülow
general
hausen
and
the
duke
of
württemberg
were
massed
in
the
center
of
the
line
there
however
general
foch
new
ninth
army
was
prepared
to
meet
the
attack
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
the
disposition
of
the
troops
these
respective
armies
were
facing
each
other
across
the
great
desolate
plain
the
ancient
battle
ground
if
the
german
center
could
break
through
the
french
center
and
if
at
the
same
time
general
von
kluck
commanding
the
german
right
could
execute
a
swift
movement
to
the
southeast
the
fifth
french
army
would
be
between
two
fires
together
with
such
part
of
the
ninth
army
as
lay
to
the
westward
of
the
point
to
be
pierced
this
strategic
plan
held
high
promise
and
it
would
have
menaced
the
whole
interior
of
france
southward
from
the
plain
of
champagne
but
even
this
second
part
of
the
plan
important
as
it
was
does
not
appear
to
have
been
the
crucial
point
in
the
campaign
the
glory
of
the
victory
if
indeed
victory
it
should
prove
as
the
successes
of
the
previous
two
weeks
had
led
the
germans
to
believe
was
to
be
given
to
the
crown
prince
with
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
with
far
more
delay
than
had
been
anticipated
the
crown
prince
army
had
at
last
managed
to
get
within
striking
distance
of
the
forefront
of
the
great
battle
line
his
forces
occupied
the
territory
north
of
verdun
to
a
southern
point
not
far
from
here
the
german
secret
service
seems
to
have
been
as
efficient
as
it
failed
to
be
with
regard
to
conditions
only
fifty
miles
away
general
sarrail
army
which
confronted
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
was
somewhat
weak
it
consisted
of
about
two
army
corps
with
reserve
divisions
nor
could
general
joffre
send
any
reenforcements
every
available
source
of
reenforcements
had
been
drawn
upon
to
aid
the
sixth
army
encamped
upon
the
banks
of
the
ourcq
in
order
that
paris
might
be
well
guarded
no
troops
could
be
spared
from
the
fifth
and
ninth
armies
which
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
attack
from
the
german
center
general
sarrail
therefore
had
to
depend
on
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
country
and
to
avoid
giving
battle
too
readily
against
the
superior
forces
by
which
he
was
confronted
it
was
a
part
of
the
plan
of
the
french
generalissimo
however
to
feel
the
strength
of
the
german
center
and
if
it
proved
that
they
could
be
held
to
release
several
divisions
and
send
them
to
the
aid
of
general
sarrail
subordinate
to
this
contemplated
attack
by
the
crown
prince
yet
forming
a
part
of
it
and
in
a
measure
a
fourth
element
in
the
campaign
was
the
double
effort
from
the
garrisons
of
metz
and
saarbrucken
combining
with
the
armies
of
the
bavarian
crown
prince
and
the
forces
of
general
von
heeringen
the
second
french
army
therefore
could
not
come
to
the
aid
of
the
third
except
in
desperate
need
for
it
was
in
the
very
forefront
of
the
attack
on
nancy
if
the
german
left
could
pierce
the
french
lines
at
nancy
and
pour
through
the
gap
of
lorraine
it
would
be
able
to
take
general
sarrail
army
in
the
rear
at
and
would
thus
completely
hem
it
in
at
the
same
time
isolating
verdun
which
thus
invested
in
the
course
of
time
must
fall
forming
an
invaluable
advanced
fortress
to
the
german
advance
illustration
battle
of
the
marne
situation
on
september
before
proceeding
to
the
actual
working
out
of
this
plan
of
campaign
it
may
be
well
to
recapitulate
it
in
order
that
each
development
may
be
clear
the
german
plan
was
to
pierce
the
french
line
at
three
places
at
meaux
at
and
at
nancy
general
von
kluck
at
meaux
would
cut
off
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
armies
from
communication
with
their
base
at
paris
the
bavarian
crown
prince
would
weaken
general
sarrail
defense
in
the
rear
and
if
possible
come
up
behind
him
and
thus
the
stage
would
be
set
for
the
great
onrush
of
the
imperial
crown
prince
who
with
an
almost
fresh
army
and
with
a
most
complete
and
elaborate
system
of
communications
and
supplies
should
be
able
to
crush
the
weak
point
in
defense
the
army
under
general
sarrail
such
a
victory
was
designed
to
shed
an
especial
luster
upon
the
crown
prince
and
thus
upon
the
hohenzollern
dynasty
a
prestige
much
needed
for
the
delays
in
the
advance
of
the
crown
prince
army
had
already
given
rise
to
mutterings
of
discontent
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
the
plan
was
sound
and
brilliant
the
disposition
of
the
forces
was
excellently
contrived
and
the
very
utmost
of
military
skill
had
been
used
in
bringing
matters
to
a
focus
the
french
plan
is
the
next
to
be
considered
from
official
orders
and
dispatches
and
also
from
the
developments
of
that
week
it
is
clear
that
general
joffre
had
perceived
the
possibility
of
such
a
plan
as
the
germans
had
actually
conceived
he
had
brought
back
his
armies
and
there
is
nothing
harder
to
handle
than
a
retreating
army
step
by
step
over
northern
france
without
losing
them
their
morale
the
loss
of
life
was
fearful
but
it
never
became
appalling
the
french
soldiers
had
faith
in
joffre
even
as
their
faith
in
france
and
while
the
germans
had
victories
to
cheer
them
on
the
soldiers
of
the
allies
had
to
keep
up
their
courage
under
the
perpetual
strain
of
retreat
the
administration
had
evacuated
paris
everywhere
it
seemed
that
the
weakness
of
france
was
becoming
apparent
to
the
three
armies
in
the
field
those
commanded
severally
by
general
manoury
sir
john
french
and
general
lanrezac
the
generalissimo
steadily
sent
reenforcements
but
he
informed
the
french
government
that
he
was
not
able
to
save
the
capital
from
a
siege
yet
as
after
events
showed
while
these
various
conditions
could
not
rightly
be
considered
as
ruses
upon
general
part
to
lure
on
the
germans
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
understood
and
took
full
advantage
of
the
readiness
of
the
attacking
hosts
to
esteem
all
these
points
as
prophetic
of
future
victory
the
first
feature
of
the
french
plan
therefore
was
to
lend
color
to
the
german
belief
that
the
armies
of
the
allies
were
disheartened
and
thereby
to
induce
the
attacking
forces
to
join
the
issue
quickly
the
second
part
of
the
french
plan
lay
in
general
joffre
decision
not
to
do
the
expected
thing
with
general
sarrail
placed
at
the
extremest
point
of
danger
it
would
have
been
a
likely
move
to
transfer
the
entire
british
expeditionary
force
from
the
left
wing
to
the
weak
point
at
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
general
von
kluck
believed
that
this
had
been
done
the
third
part
of
the
defensive
prepared
by
general
joffre
was
that
of
a
determination
to
turn
the
steady
retreat
into
a
counterdrive
time
after
time
had
the
other
generals
implored
their
leader
to
give
them
leave
to
take
the
offensive
and
on
every
occasion
a
shake
of
the
head
had
been
the
reply
sir
john
french
had
wondered
but
when
the
french
officers
found
themselves
in
the
region
of
the
marne
close
to
the
marshes
of
gond
where
in
napoleon
had
faced
the
russians
they
were
more
content
it
was
familiar
as
well
as
historic
ground
even
the
youngest
officer
knew
every
foot
of
that
ground
thoroughly
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
best
point
for
the
forward
leap
and
one
of
the
last
points
at
which
a
halt
could
be
made
the
fourth
part
of
the
plan
was
the
holding
fast
to
the
point
of
verdun
for
thereby
the
communication
of
the
armies
of
the
central
powers
was
seriously
weakened
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
this
actual
fighting
army
of
more
than
a
million
men
depended
for
food
and
for
ammunition
supplies
upon
the
routes
from
belgium
and
luxemburg
by
way
of
mézières
and
montmédy
and
the
circuitous
line
to
brussels
via
quentin
had
maubeuge
fallen
a
little
earlier
the
situation
of
the
central
powers
would
have
been
less
difficult
and
both
commissariat
and
ammunition
problems
would
have
been
easier
of
solution
but
maubeuge
held
out
until
september
and
by
that
time
the
prime
results
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
had
been
achieved
to
this
problem
verdun
was
the
key
for
from
metz
through
verdun
ran
the
main
line
less
than
the
length
of
line
to
the
belgian
bases
of
supplies
and
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
country
a
line
that
could
be
held
with
a
quarter
the
number
of
men
but
verdun
stood
and
general
joffre
held
the
two
armies
back
to
back
converging
on
the
point
at
verdun
such
was
the
country
over
which
the
battles
of
the
marne
were
fought
such
were
the
numbers
and
dispositions
of
the
several
armies
on
each
side
and
such
as
far
as
can
be
judged
were
the
plans
and
counterplans
of
the
strategic
leaders
in
the
great
conflict
chapter
xiv
first
moves
in
the
battle
the
first
movement
in
this
concerted
plan
was
taken
by
the
german
extreme
right
this
was
the
closing
in
of
general
von
kluck
army
in
a
southeasterly
direction
it
was
a
hazardous
move
for
it
required
general
von
kluck
to
execute
a
flank
march
diagonally
across
the
front
of
the
sixth
french
army
and
the
british
expeditionary
force
at
this
time
according
to
the
dispatches
from
sir
john
french
the
british
army
lay
south
of
the
marne
between
lagny
and
defending
the
passage
of
the
river
and
blowing
up
the
bridges
before
general
von
kluck
on
september
air
reconnaissances
showed
that
general
von
kluck
had
stopped
his
southward
advance
upon
paris
and
that
his
columns
were
moving
in
a
southeasterly
direction
east
of
a
line
drawn
through
nanteuil
and
lizy
on
the
ourcq
meanwhile
the
french
and
british
generals
more
effectually
concealed
their
armies
in
the
forests
doing
so
with
such
skill
that
their
movements
were
unmarked
by
the
german
air
scouts
all
that
day
general
von
kluck
moved
his
forces
leaving
his
heavy
artillery
with
about
men
on
the
steep
eastern
bank
of
the
ourcq
and
taking
troops
south
across
the
marne
toward
la
ferté
gaucher
he
crossed
the
petit
morin
and
the
grand
morin
all
unconscious
that
scores
of
field
glasses
were
trained
upon
his
troops
probably
believing
that
the
british
army
had
been
hurried
to
the
aid
of
general
sarrail
general
von
kluck
advanced
confidently
having
concealment
in
view
the
commanders
of
the
french
army
and
the
british
army
between
them
had
left
a
wide
gap
between
the
two
armies
through
one
of
these
apparently
unguarded
openings
a
strong
body
of
uhlan
patrols
advanced
riding
southward
until
they
reached
nogent
south
of
paris
and
seemingly
with
the
whole
rich
country
of
central
france
laid
wide
open
to
a
sharp
and
sudden
attack
among
the
many
strange
features
of
this
series
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
this
must
certainly
be
reckoned
as
one
though
possessing
an
unequaled
military
organization
though
priding
itself
on
its
cavalry
scouts
though
aided
by
aerial
scouts
and
though
well
supplied
with
spies
yet
the
allied
armies
with
the
device
of
a
forest
were
able
to
cloak
their
movements
from
this
perfectly
organized
and
powerful
invading
army
much
of
the
credit
of
this
may
be
assigned
to
the
french
and
english
aircraft
which
kept
german
scouting
aircraft
at
a
distance
but
the
allied
generals
were
astounded
at
the
result
of
their
maneuver
which
as
they
admitted
afterward
was
merely
a
military
precautionary
measure
against
the
discovery
of
artillery
sites
and
a
device
to
keep
the
enemy
in
general
ignorance
on
saturday
september
at
the
extreme
north
of
the
line
of
the
two
armies
facing
each
other
across
the
ourcq
an
artillery
duel
began
the
offensive
was
taken
by
the
french
and
though
in
itself
it
was
not
more
striking
than
any
of
the
artillery
clashes
that
had
marked
the
previous
month
fighting
it
was
significant
for
it
marked
the
beginning
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
the
plans
of
general
joffre
were
complete
but
the
actual
point
at
which
the
furious
contest
should
begin
was
not
yet
determined
in
the
northern
ourcq
section
however
the
realization
by
the
french
that
they
were
actually
on
the
offensive
at
last
that
the
long
period
of
retreat
was
over
could
not
be
restrained
the
troops
were
eager
to
get
to
work
with
the
bayonet
and
greatly
aided
by
their
field
artillery
in
which
mobility
had
been
sacrificed
to
power
they
quickly
cleared
the
hills
to
the
westward
of
the
ourcq
by
nightfall
of
september
the
country
west
of
the
ourcq
was
in
french
hands
but
to
cross
that
river
seemed
impossible
general
von
kluck
heavy
artillery
had
been
left
behind
to
hold
that
position
and
every
possible
crossing
was
covered
with
its
own
blast
of
death
here
general
von
kluck
generalship
was
successful
it
might
have
been
regarded
as
risky
to
leave
men
to
guard
a
river
confronted
by
picked
and
reenforced
french
troops
but
general
von
faith
in
german
guns
and
german
gunnery
was
not
this
was
the
first
of
the
siege
conflicts
and
the
french
army
had
no
guns
which
could
be
used
against
the
german
heavy
artillery
hence
it
followed
that
the
brilliant
work
of
the
sixth
french
army
on
this
first
day
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
achieved
no
important
result
for
the
hidden
howitzers
manned
by
expert
german
gunners
and
well
supplied
with
ammunition
defied
all
attempts
at
crossing
the
little
stream
of
the
ourcq
this
first
day
fighting
on
the
marne
revealed
one
of
chiefest
needs
heavy
artillery
the
french
light
gun
was
a
deadly
weapon
but
france
had
neglected
the
one
department
of
artillery
in
which
the
germans
had
been
most
successful
the
use
of
powerful
motor
traction
to
move
big
guns
without
slackening
the
march
of
an
army
general
von
kluck
artillery
was
impregnable
to
the
french
indeed
the
germans
could
not
be
dislodged
from
the
ourcq
until
the
british
expeditionary
force
sent
up
some
heavy
field
batteries
it
was
then
too
late
for
the
withdrawal
from
the
ourcq
to
be
of
any
serious
consequence
in
determining
the
result
along
the
battle
front
the
afternoon
of
that
day
when
the
zouaves
were
driving
the
germans
across
the
ourcq
with
the
bayonet
and
were
themselves
effectually
stopped
by
the
german
wall
of
artillery
fire
general
joffre
and
sir
john
french
met
at
last
the
british
commander
received
the
welcome
news
from
the
generalissimo
that
retreat
was
over
and
advance
was
about
to
be
begun
i
met
the
french
commander
in
chief
at
his
request
runs
the
official
dispatch
and
he
informed
me
of
his
intention
to
take
the
offensive
forthwith
by
wheeling
up
the
left
flank
of
the
sixth
army
pivoting
on
the
marne
and
directing
it
to
move
on
the
ourcq
cross
and
attack
the
flank
of
the
first
german
army
which
was
then
moving
in
a
southeasterly
direction
east
of
that
river
he
requested
me
to
effect
a
change
of
front
to
my
right
my
left
resting
on
the
marne
and
my
right
on
the
fifth
army
to
fill
the
gap
between
that
army
and
the
sixth
i
was
then
to
advance
against
the
enemy
on
my
front
and
join
in
the
general
offensive
movement
german
troops
which
were
observed
moving
southeast
up
the
left
bank
of
the
ourcq
on
the
fourth
were
now
reported
to
be
halted
and
facing
that
river
heads
of
the
enemy
columns
were
seen
crossing
at
changis
la
ferté
nogent
and
mezy
considerable
german
columns
of
all
arms
were
seen
to
be
converging
on
montmirail
while
before
sunset
large
bivouacs
of
the
enemy
were
located
in
the
neighborhood
of
coulommiers
south
of
rebais
la
and
dagny
these
combined
movements
practically
commenced
on
sunday
september
at
sunrise
and
on
that
day
it
may
be
said
that
a
great
battle
opened
on
a
front
extending
from
ermenonville
which
was
just
in
front
of
the
left
flank
of
the
sixth
french
army
through
lizy
on
the
marne
maupertuis
which
was
about
the
british
center
courtaçon
which
was
the
left
of
the
fifth
french
army
to
esternay
and
charleville
the
left
of
the
ninth
army
under
general
foch
and
so
along
the
front
of
the
ninth
fourth
and
third
french
armies
to
a
point
north
of
the
fortress
of
verdun
sunrise
on
sunday
morning
on
a
summer
day
in
sunny
france
was
the
setting
for
the
grim
and
red
carnage
which
should
show
in
the
next
five
consecutive
days
that
the
german
advance
was
checked
that
the
southernmost
point
had
been
reached
and
that
for
a
long
time
to
come
it
would
tax
the
resources
of
the
invaders
to
hold
the
land
that
already
had
been
won
general
joffre
had
so
arranged
his
forces
that
the
most
spectacular
and
the
easiest
part
fell
to
the
british
and
it
was
accomplished
with
perfection
of
detail
but
the
honors
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
lay
with
general
army
and
with
the
iron
division
of
toul
on
the
same
morning
this
special
army
order
issued
by
sir
john
french
was
read
to
the
british
troops
after
a
most
trying
series
of
operations
mostly
in
retirement
which
have
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
general
strategic
plan
of
the
allied
armies
the
british
forces
stand
formed
in
line
with
their
french
comrades
ready
to
attack
the
enemy
foiled
in
their
attempt
to
invest
paris
the
germans
have
been
driven
to
move
in
an
easterly
and
southeasterly
direction
with
the
apparent
intention
of
falling
in
strength
upon
the
fifth
french
army
in
this
operation
they
are
exposing
their
right
flank
and
their
line
of
communications
to
an
attack
from
the
combined
sixth
french
army
and
the
british
forces
i
call
upon
the
british
army
in
france
to
now
show
the
enemy
its
power
and
to
push
on
vigorously
to
the
attack
beside
the
sixth
french
army
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
call
upon
them
in
vain
but
that
on
the
contrary
by
another
manifestation
of
the
magnificent
spirit
which
they
have
shown
in
the
past
fortnight
they
will
fall
on
the
flank
with
all
their
strength
and
in
unison
with
the
allies
drive
them
back
as
before
the
day
fighting
began
with
the
efforts
of
the
sixth
french
army
against
the
ourcq
before
the
germans
could
be
driven
from
the
east
bank
the
few
villages
they
occupied
on
the
west
bank
had
to
be
taken
and
as
these
were
covered
by
heavy
artillery
from
the
farther
bank
the
french
loss
of
life
was
very
severe
yet
these
several
combats
of
which
there
were
as
many
as
there
were
villages
were
stationary
in
every
case
the
germans
were
compelled
to
cross
the
river
in
every
case
the
artillery
made
it
impossible
for
the
french
to
follow
them
at
dawn
also
everyone
of
the
french
armies
advanced
and
within
two
or
three
hours
of
sunrise
found
themselves
engaged
with
the
german
front
the
spirited
order
to
the
troops
issued
that
morning
by
general
joffre
had
left
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
frenchmen
on
the
importance
of
the
issue
it
read
at
a
moment
when
a
battle
on
which
the
welfare
of
the
country
depends
is
going
to
begin
i
feel
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
remind
you
all
that
this
is
no
longer
the
time
to
look
behind
all
our
efforts
must
be
directed
toward
attacking
and
driving
back
the
enemy
an
army
which
can
no
longer
advance
must
at
all
costs
keep
the
ground
it
has
won
and
allow
itself
to
be
killed
on
the
spot
rather
than
give
way
in
the
present
circumstance
no
faltering
can
be
tolerated
yet
in
spite
of
the
powerful
efforts
of
the
french
armies
they
were
all
held
in
check
and
general
sarrail
was
beginning
to
give
way
though
the
fighting
in
the
center
had
been
stationary
on
this
sixth
of
september
it
had
been
desperate
was
facing
the
men
of
von
kluck
army
and
the
effect
of
the
british
attack
on
von
kluck
flank
had
not
yet
been
felt
he
more
than
held
his
own
but
at
great
cost
general
foch
with
the
ninth
army
had
a
double
problem
for
he
was
wrestling
with
general
von
bülow
to
hold
the
southern
edge
of
the
sézanne
plateau
while
general
von
hausen
saxon
army
was
trying
to
turn
his
right
flank
a
violent
attack
which
for
the
space
of
over
two
hours
seemed
likely
to
succeed
was
launched
by
the
duke
of
württemberg
against
general
langle
and
the
fourth
army
the
attack
was
repelled
but
the
french
losses
were
proportionately
great
there
could
be
no
denial
that
many
such
attacks
could
break
through
the
line
general
army
fighting
a
losing
game
showed
marvelous
stubbornness
and
gameness
but
even
so
it
could
not
resist
being
pushed
south
of
fort
troyon
itself
unable
to
support
the
battering
it
might
expect
to
receive
when
the
german
siege
guns
should
be
brought
into
place
illustration
battle
of
the
marne
end
of
german
retreat
and
the
intrenched
line
on
the
aisne
river
at
every
point
but
one
the
germans
had
a
right
to
deem
the
day
successful
the
only
reversal
had
been
a
minor
one
before
the
forest
of
crécy
yet
of
all
the
generals
on
that
front
von
kluck
alone
was
in
a
position
to
see
the
gravity
of
the
situation
the
british
had
caught
him
on
the
flank
as
he
tried
to
pierce
the
left
wing
of
general
army
and
if
he
should
now
retreat
that
army
could
envelop
him
and
thus
catch
him
between
two
fires
next
morning
monday
september
another
glorious
summer
morning
saw
a
resumption
of
the
battle
along
exactly
the
same
lines
with
the
same
persistent
attack
and
defense
along
the
eastern
part
of
the
front
and
with
the
british
making
full
use
of
the
blunder
made
by
the
german
right
general
von
kluck
had
realized
his
plight
but
even
so
he
had
not
secured
an
understanding
of
the
size
of
the
force
that
was
threatening
his
flank
and
he
sent
as
a
reenforcement
a
single
army
corps
which
had
been
intrenched
near
coulommiers
on
the
grand
morin
the
british
had
three
full
army
corps
and
were
well
supplied
with
cavalry
and
artillery
yet
coulommiers
was
von
kluck
headquarters
and
actually
when
the
germans
were
driven
back
and
the
british
troops
entered
the
town
prince
eitel
the
second
son
of
the
kaiser
general
von
kluck
and
his
staff
were
compelled
to
run
down
to
their
motor
cars
and
escape
at
top
speed
along
the
road
to
rebais
leaving
their
breakfast
on
the
table
and
their
glasses
of
wine
half
emptied
one
of
the
most
dramatic
cavalry
actions
of
this
period
of
the
war
took
place
shortly
before
noon
when
one
hundred
and
seventeen
squadrons
of
cavalry
were
engaged
in
this
action
the
british
were
successful
but
the
german
cavalry
were
tired
and
harassed
having
been
severely
handled
the
day
before
in
this
engagement
between
the
british
and
the
german
right
all
the
odds
had
been
in
favor
of
the
british
and
success
meant
merely
the
grasping
at
opportunities
that
presented
themselves
still
by
constantly
striking
at
general
van
kluck
exposed
flank
his
frontal
attack
of
general
was
so
weakened
that
toward
evening
at
the
close
of
two
days
of
continuous
and
very
severe
fighting
the
fifth
french
army
was
able
to
advance
and
hold
the
position
from
la
to
esternay
the
ground
gained
was
valuable
but
not
essential
yet
it
made
a
profound
impression
general
step
forward
was
the
germans
step
back
it
meant
that
the
road
to
paris
was
barred
how
fully
this
was
realized
may
be
seen
from
an
order
signed
by
lieutenant
general
tuelff
von
tschepe
und
weidenbach
and
found
in
the
house
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
staff
of
the
eighth
german
army
corps
when
the
victorious
french
entered
the
order
was
dated
september
and
it
read
as
follows
the
object
of
our
long
and
arduous
marches
has
been
achieved
the
principal
french
troops
have
been
forced
to
accept
battle
after
having
been
continually
forced
back
the
great
decision
is
undoubtedly
at
hand
therefore
the
whole
strength
of
the
german
army
as
well
as
all
that
of
our
army
corps
are
bound
to
be
engaged
all
along
the
line
from
paris
to
verdun
to
save
the
welfare
and
the
honor
or
germany
i
expect
every
officer
and
man
notwithstanding
the
hard
and
heroic
fights
of
the
last
few
days
to
do
his
duty
unswervingly
and
to
the
last
breath
everything
depends
on
the
result
of
much
did
indeed
depend
on
the
result
of
the
morrow
and
for
the
third
day
again
it
was
general
von
kluck
initial
move
that
brought
disaster
to
the
german
side
why
was
it
that
von
kluck
instead
of
marching
directly
on
paris
as
would
have
been
expected
made
a
detour
having
as
his
object
not
the
capital
but
the
french
army
it
may
be
said
in
favor
of
it
that
the
decision
taken
by
the
german
general
staff
was
in
conformity
with
the
military
doctrine
of
napoleon
according
to
this
doctrine
a
capital
whatever
its
importance
is
never
more
than
an
accessory
object
geographical
or
political
what
is
of
importance
is
the
strategical
object
the
strategical
object
is
the
essential
the
geographical
object
is
only
accessory
once
the
essential
object
is
attained
the
accessory
object
is
acquired
of
itself
once
the
french
armies
had
been
beaten
thrown
back
and
dispersed
von
kluck
could
return
to
the
capital
and
take
it
easily
conceive
of
him
on
the
other
hand
attacking
the
capital
with
the
army
of
manoury
on
his
right
which
constituted
a
serious
menace
to
his
left
and
in
front
or
him
the
british
army
and
the
fifth
french
army
he
might
have
been
caught
as
in
a
vise
between
these
forces
while
all
his
activity
was
being
absorbed
by
his
attack
on
the
intrenchments
around
paris
it
has
been
said
that
if
von
kluck
had
won
the
french
capital
as
it
seemed
he
might
the
french
could
not
have
gained
the
battle
of
the
marne
and
the
result
of
the
war
might
have
been
very
different
it
was
however
no
mistake
on
the
part
of
von
kluck
no
false
maneuver
on
his
part
that
determined
the
victory
of
the
marne
von
kluck
did
exactly
what
he
ought
to
have
done
the
decision
taken
by
the
german
general
staff
was
exactly
what
it
ought
to
have
taken
and
what
was
foreseen
during
the
whole
course
of
the
war
it
was
on
september
in
the
morning
that
the
observations
made
by
the
french
cavalry
as
well
as
by
british
aviators
and
those
of
the
army
of
manoury
and
the
military
government
of
paris
made
it
clear
that
the
german
right
von
kluck
army
was
bending
its
march
toward
the
southeast
in
the
direction
of
meaux
and
coulommiers
leaving
behind
it
the
road
to
paris
at
this
moment
the
fifth
french
army
of
the
left
was
ready
to
meet
the
german
forces
in
a
frontal
attack
and
it
was
flanked
toward
the
northwest
by
the
british
army
and
by
general
army
to
the
northeast
of
the
capital
the
disposition
of
forces
aimed
at
in
general
joffre
order
of
august
was
thus
accomplished
the
french
escaped
the
turning
movement
and
they
were
in
a
position
to
counter
with
an
enveloping
movement
themselves
the
wings
of
the
french
forces
found
support
in
their
maneuvering
in
their
contact
with
the
strongholds
of
paris
and
verdun
immediately
the
commander
in
chief
decided
to
attack
and
issued
on
the
evening
of
september
the
series
of
general
orders
given
as
an
appendix
to
this
volume
which
announced
the
big
offensive
and
eventually
turned
the
tide
of
battle
chapter
xv
german
retreat
that
morning
of
the
then
saw
general
von
kluck
in
full
retreat
his
frontal
attack
on
general
had
failed
and
the
fifth
french
army
had
advanced
the
british
were
at
his
flank
and
besides
they
had
been
able
to
spare
some
of
their
heavy
artillery
to
send
to
the
sixth
army
under
general
maunoury
to
enable
him
to
cross
the
ourcq
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
even
with
this
assistance
could
the
sixth
army
have
silenced
the
terrible
fire
of
those
howitzers
but
general
von
kluck
dared
no
longer
leave
his
artillery
there
it
must
be
taken
with
him
on
his
retreat
or
become
valuable
booty
leaving
a
few
batteries
to
guard
the
crossings
of
the
river
the
ourcq
division
of
the
german
right
retreated
in
good
order
to
rejoin
their
comrades
who
had
been
so
unexpectedly
mauled
by
the
british
the
honor
of
this
day
was
curiously
not
to
the
victorious
but
to
the
defeated
army
had
general
von
kluck
done
nothing
other
than
conduct
his
army
in
retreat
as
he
did
he
would
have
shown
himself
an
able
commander
sir
john
french
and
general
followed
up
their
advantage
the
artillery
fire
of
the
british
was
good
and
in
a
running
fight
such
as
this
retreat
the
light
field
artillery
of
the
french
did
terrible
execution
the
brunt
of
the
british
fighting
was
at
la
tretoire
general
fought
steadily
forward
all
day
driving
the
retreating
army
as
closely
as
he
could
but
proceeding
warily
because
of
general
von
powerful
counterattacks
the
fighting
was
continuous
from
the
first
break
of
daylight
until
after
dusk
had
fallen
and
it
was
in
the
twilight
that
the
french
army
at
last
carried
montmirail
on
the
petit
morin
a
feat
of
strategic
value
since
it
exposed
the
right
flank
of
von
bülow
army
exposed
by
the
retreat
of
general
von
kluck
from
this
review
of
the
forced
retirement
of
general
von
kluck
it
will
be
seen
that
the
german
right
was
compelled
to
sustain
an
attack
at
three
points
from
the
sixth
french
army
on
the
banks
of
the
ourcq
from
the
british
army
in
the
region
of
coulommiers
and
from
the
fifth
french
army
near
courtaçon
each
of
these
attacks
was
of
a
widely
different
character
the
result
of
this
attack
lias
been
shown
in
the
summary
of
the
three
days
four
days
on
the
ourcq
which
resulted
in
the
british
capture
of
coulommiers
and
in
the
french
capture
of

this
was
general
counteroffensive
and
it
developed
in
detail
almost
exactly
along
the
lines
that
he
had
laid
down
the
scene
of
the
fighting
across
the
west
bank
of
the
ourcq
was
that
of
a
country
gently
undulating
dotted
with
comfortable
farmhouses
and
made
up
of
a
mosaic
of
green
meadow
lands
and
the
stubble
of
grain
fields
the
german
heavy
guns
came
into
action
as
soon
as
the
french
offensive
developed
tremendous
detonations
that
shook
the
earth
and
which
were
followed
by
sluggish
clouds
of
an
oily
smoke
showed
where
the
shells
had
struck
already
by
the
evening
of
the
first
day
fighting
there
were
blazing
haystacks
and
farmhouses
to
be
seen
and
the
happy
and
smiling
plain
showed
scarred
and
rent
with
the
mangling
hand
of
war
on
the
a
sugar
refinery
which
had
been
held
as
an
outpost
by
a
force
of
germans
was
set
on
fire
by
a
french
battery
the
infantry
had
been
successful
in
getting
to
within
close
range
and
as
the
invaders
sought
to
escape
from
the
burning
building
they
were
picked
off
one
by
one
by
the
french
marksmen
the
french
infantry
well
intrenched
suffered
scarcely
any
loss
it
was
in
brilliant
sunshine
that
the
fire
broke
out
and
the
conflagration
was
so
fierce
that
the
empty
building
sent
up
little
smoke
the
flames
scarcely
showed
in
the
bright
light
and
to
the
onlooker
it
seemed
as
if
some
rapid
leprous
disease
was
eating
up
the
building
the
situation
was
horrible
for
the
germans
either
to
be
trapped
and
to
perish
in
the
flames
or
to
face
the
withering
french
infantry
fire
without
any
opportunity
to
fight
back
less
than
of
the
occupants
of
the
refinery
won
clear
wherever
the
forces
met
the
slaughter
was
great
and
terrible
in
the
excitement
and
the
eagerness
of
the
first
offensive
the
french
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
lessons
of
prudence
that
the
long
retreat
should
have
ingrained
into
their
memory
and
they
sought
to
take
every
village
that
was
occupied
by
the
germans
with
a
rush
the
loss
of
life
was
greatest
at
a
point
four
miles
east
of
meaux
there
on
a
sharp
ridge
the
germans
had
intrenched
and
gun
platforms
had
been
placed
under
the
screen
of
the
trees
an
almost
incessant
hail
of
shrapnel
fell
on
these
lines
and
the
french
infantry
charges
were
repulsed
again
and
again
with
but
little
loss
on
the
german
line
but
meantime
village
after
village
had
been
attacked
by
the
french
and
carried
with
the
bayonet
and
on
sunday
september
that
part
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
which
dealt
with
the
driving
back
of
the
germans
to
the
line
of
the
ourcq
was
in
some
of
its
feature
like
a
conflict
of
ages
long
gone
by
yet
overhead
aeroplanes
circled
on
every
side
shells
were
bursting
the
heavy
smell
of
blood
on
a
hot
day
mingled
with
the
explosive
fumes
but
the
zouaves
and
the
turcos
fought
without
ceasing
and
with
a
force
and
spirit
that
went
far
to
win
for
the
french
the
cheering
news
that
village
after
village
had
been
freed
of
the
invaders
when
the
night
of
that
sunday
fell
however
on
the
line
of
the
ourcq
the
balm
of
darkness
seemed
to
be
almost
as
much
a
forgotten
thing
as
the
blessedness
of
silence
there
was
no
darkness
that
night
as
the
germans
evacuated
each
village
they
set
fire
to
it
the
invaders
actually
held
their
machine
guns
at
work
in
the
burning
village
until
the
position
was
no
longer
tenable
the
wind
blew
gustily
that
night
and
all
the
hours
long
the
germans
collected
their
dead
built
great
pyres
of
wood
and
straw
and
cremated
their
comrades
who
had
fallen
on
the
field
of
honor
the
next
day
at
this
point
developed
fighting
of
the
same
general
character
one
of
the
most
heroic
defenses
of
general
von
army
was
that
of
the
magdeburg
regiment
which
held
its
advanced
post
ten
minutes
too
long
and
consequently
was
practically
annihilated
although
the
french
had
everywhere
shown
themselves
superior
with
the
bayonet
and
at
close
infighting
even
as
the
germans
had
displayed
an
incredible
courage
in
advance
under
gunfire
and
rightly
held
their
heavy
artillery
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
in
the
mêlée
around
the
colors
of
the
magdeburg
regiment
there
was
nothing
to
choose
for
either
side
the
lieutenant
color
bearer
was
killed
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
dead
and
not
until
almost
the
whole
regiment
had
been
killed
under
the
impact
of
far
superior
numbers
were
the
tattered
colors
taken
into
the
french
lines
it
was
on
this
day
tuesday
september
that
the
british
army
realizing
that
it
had
turned
the
flank
of
general
von
kluck
southern
divisions
sent
its
heavy
batteries
to
the
pressure
on
the
banks
of
the
ourcq
a
graphic
picture
of
the
artillery
side
of
the
fighting
on
the
ourcq
was
given
by
one
of
the
artillery
officers
detached
from
the
british
force
meaux
was
still
a
town
of
blank
shutters
and
empty
streets
when
we
got
there
this
morning
he
wrote
but
the
french
sappers
had
thrown
a
plank
gangway
across
the
gap
in
the
ruined
old
bridge
built
in
that
had
survived
all
the
wars
of
france
only
to
perish
at
last
in
this
one
smack
smack
smack
smack
go
the
french
guns
and
then
a
few
seconds
later
four
white
mushrooms
of
smoke
spring
up
over
the
far
woods
and
slowly
the
pop
pop
pop
pop
of
the
distant
explosions
comes
back
to
you
but
now
it
is
the
german
gunners
turn
bang
go
his
guns
two
miles
away
there
is
a
moment
of
eerie
and
uncomfortable
silence
uncomfortable
because
there
is
just
a
chance
they
might
have
altered
their
range
and
then
quite
close
by
over
the
wood
where
the
battery
is
come
the
crashes
of
the
bursting
shells
they
sound
like
a
titan
blows
on
a
gigantic
kettle
filled
with
tons
of
old
iron
at
trilport
there
is
a
yawning
gap
where
one
arch
of
the
railway
bridge
used
to
be
with
a
solitary
bent
rail
still
lying
across
it
and
among
the
wreckage
of
the
bridge
below
lying
on
its
side
and
more
than
half
beneath
the
water
is
the
smashed
and
splintered
ruin
of
a
closed
motor
car
beyond
the
town
was
a
ridge
on
which
the
french
batteries
were
posted
we
could
see
the
ammunition
wagons
parked
on
the
reverse
slope
of
the
hill
more
were
moving
up
to
join
them
the
village
beyond
penchard
was
thronged
with
troops
and
blocked
with
ambulance
wagons
and
ammunition
carts
through
the
rank
grass
at
the
side
came
tramping
a
long
file
of
dusty
sweating
wearied
men
they
carried
long
spades
and
picks
as
well
as
their
rifles
they
had
come
out
of
the
firing
line
and
were
going
back
to
penchard
for
food
topping
the
next
ridge
the
hill
slopes
steeply
down
to
the
hamlet
of
chamvery
just
below
us
the
battery
which
i
mentioned
just
now
is
in
the
wood
on
this
side
of
it
to
our
right
the
firing
line
is
lying
flat
on
the
hillside
a
little
way
beyond
the
village
and
behind
them
farther
down
the
hill
are
thick
lines
of
supports
in
the
cover
of
intrenchments
it
is
a
spectacle
entirely
typical
of
a
modern
battle
for
there
is
scarcely
anything
to
see
at
all
if
it
were
not
for
those
shells
being
tossed
to
and
fro
on
the
right
there
and
an
occasional
splutter
of
rifle
fire
one
might
easily
suppose
that
the
lines
of
men
lying
about
on
the
stubble
were
all
dozing
in
the
hot
afternoon
sun
even
when
some
of
them
move
they
seem
to
do
it
lazily
to
saunter
rather
than
to
walk
it
is
only
in
the
cinematograph
or
on
the
comparatively
rare
occasions
of
close
fighting
at
short
range
that
men
rush
about
dramatically
for
one
thing
they
are
too
tired
to
hurry
and
anyhow
what
is
the
use
of
running
when
a
shell
may
burst
any
minute
anywhere
in
the
square
mile
you
happen
to
be
on
i
walked
with
the
company
officers
who
were
planning
a
fresh
advance
map
in
hand
they
had
gained
the
village
in
which
we
were
that
morning
but
at
tremendous
loss
of
my
company
of
said
one
captain
are
only
left
it
the
same
story
everywhere
the
german
machine
guns
their
fire
simply
clears
the
ground
like
a
razor
you
just
understand
how
anyone
gets
away
alive
i
had
men
fall
at
my
right
hand
and
my
left
you
ca
look
anywhere
as
you
advance
without
seeing
men
dropping
of
our
four
officers
two
are
wounded
and
one
dead
i
am
left
alone
in
command
this
fighting
for
the
possession
of
villages
on
the
west
bank
of
the
marne
this
heavy
loss
to
the
french
troops
by
the
german
artillery
and
this
sudden
check
at
the
ourcq
itself
until
british
heavy
batteries
were
sent
marks
the
character
of
what
may
be
called
the
battle
of
the
ourcq
the
westernmost
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
as
general
von
kluck
had
divided
his
forces
in
order
to
carry
out
the
attempt
to
pierce
the
left
of
general
army
the
german
forces
in
the
battle
of
the
ourcq
were
outnumbered
almost
three
to
one
in
spite
of
these
odds
against
them
the
extreme
german
right
held
for
four
days
the
position
it
had
been
given
to
hold
chapter
xvi
continuation
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
remembering
again
the
general
outline
of
general
von
kluck
plan
that
of
executing
a
diagonal
movement
with
of
his
men
to
attack
the
easternmost
point
of
the
fifth
army
and
possibly
to
envelop
it
by
a
flank
movement
the
continuation
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
may
be
treated
with
more
detail
this
part
is
called
by
some
the
battle
of
coulommiers
in
this
battle
there
was
as
great
a
change
in
morale
as
in
the
battle
of
the
ourcq
there
the
french
had
been
stirred
to
high
endeavor
by
the
realization
that
the
word
to
advance
had
at
last
been
given
this
also
operated
in
part
on
the
british
in
the
battle
of
coulommiers
but
in
addition
there
was
another
very
important
factor
the
dawn
of
that
sunday
summer
morning
september
was
one
of
great
exhilaration
for
the
british
forces
the
offensive
was
begun
the
time
for
striking
back
had
come
and
every
column
resounded
with
marching
choruses
the
countryside
was
lovely
as
had
been
all
the
countryside
through
which
the
retreating
armies
had
passed
gay
with
the
little
french
homesteads
flower
decked
and
smiling
heavily
laden
orchards
and
rich
grain
fields
some
as
yet
uncut
some
newly
stacked
women
and
children
with
here
and
there
an
old
man
ran
along
the
line
of
march
ministering
to
the
wants
of
their
defenders
there
was
no
need
for
language
as
courtesy
and
gratitude
are
universal
and
the
english
were
fighting
for
la
belle
france
so
the
morning
wore
on
through
the
forested
region
of
crécy
the
british
passed
and
it
has
been
told
hereinbefore
how
they
surprised
the
two
cavalry
commands
thrust
out
as
scouts
by
general
von
kluck
but
as
they
reached
the
land
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
german
hosts
the
bearing
of
the
men
changed
even
as
the
country
changed
the
simple
homes
of
the
peasants
were
in
ashes
every
house
that
had
showed
traces
of
comfort
had
been
sacked
or
gutted
with
fire
between
noon
and
three
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
three
burned
churches
were
passed
the
songs
stopped
a
black
silence
fell
upon
the
ranks
bloody
business
was
afoot
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
slumbrous
harvest
afternoon
that
a
big
gun
boomed
in
the
distance
and
the
shell
shrieked
dolefully
through
the
air
its
vicious
whine
ceasing
with
a
tremendous
sudden
roar
as
it
burst
behind
the
advancing
british
lines
on
the
instant
sir
john
french
batteries
almost
wiped
out
the
german
cavalry
and
ten
minutes
had
not
elapsed
before
the
full
artillery
on
both
sides
had
begun
a
terrific
fire
that
was
stunning
to
the
senses
under
cover
of
their
own
fire
the
british
infantry
advanced
and
hurled
themselves
against
the
outer
line
of
general
von
second
army
the
attack
failed
the
british
were
driven
back
but
though
the
loss
of
life
was
sharp
it
was
not
great
as
the
british
commander
had
but
advanced
his
men
to
test
out
the
invader
strength
the
british
artillery
was
well
placed
and
under
its
cover
the
british
made
a
second
advance
this
time
successful
the
germans
replied
with
a
counterattack
which
was
repulsed
but
in
that
forty
minutes
men
had
fallen
a
dispatch
has
been
quoted
from
a
french
soldier
showing
the
terrible
havoc
caused
by
the
german
machine
guns
and
a
letter
from
a
german
officer
published
in
the
intelligenzblatt
of
berne
pays
a
like
tribute
to
the
artillery
of
the
allies
speaking
of
this
very
section
or
the
battle
front
he
wrote
we
were
obliged
to
retreat
as
the
english
were
attempting
a
turning
movement
which
was
discovered
by
our
airmen
this
refers
to
the
advance
of
the
british
first
army
corps
under
sir
douglas
haig
in
the
direction
of
la
which
if
it
could
have
been
successfully
carried
out
would
have
meant
the
entire
loss
of
general
von
kluck
southern
army
during
the
last
two
hours
we
were
continually
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
enemy
artillery
for
our
artillery
had
all
either
been
put
out
of
action
or
had
retreated
and
had
ceased
to
fire
this
dispatch
was
evidently
therefore
written
toward
the
end
of
the
second
day
on
monday
september
when
general
von
kluck
realized
that
his
forward
drive
had
failed
and
that
he
must
fall
back
the
enemy
airmen
flew
above
us
describing
two
circles
which
means
is
infantry
here
the
enemy
artillery
mowed
the
ground
with
its
fire
in
one
minute
time
i
counted
forty
shells
the
shrapnel
exploded
nearer
and
nearer
at
last
it
reached
our
ranks
i
quickly
hugged
a
knapsack
to
my
stomach
in
order
to
protect
myself
as
best
i
could
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
rang
out
on
all
sides
tears
came
to
my
eyes
when
i
heard
the
poor
devils
moaning
with
pain
the
dust
the
smoke
and
the
stench
of
the
powder
were
suffocating
an
order
rang
out
and
bending
as
low
as
possible
we
started
up
we
had
to
pass
right
in
the
line
of
fire
the
men
began
to
fall
like
ninepins
god
be
thanked
that
i
was
able
to
run
as
i
did
i
thought
my
heart
would
burst
and
was
about
to
throw
myself
on
the
ground
unable
to
continue
when
your
image
and
that
of
bolli
rose
before
my
eyes
and
i
ran
on
at
last
we
reached
our
batteries
three
guns
were
smashed
to
pieces
and
the
gun
carriages
were
burned
we
halted
for
a
few
seconds
to
take
breath
and
all
the
time
that
whistling
and
banging
of
the
shells
continued
it
is
a
wonder
one
is
not
driven
mad
admiration
can
not
be
withheld
from
general
von
kluck
for
his
splendid
fight
at
the
battle
of
coulommiers
he
was
for
one
thing
because
of
his
plan
or
his
orders
to
strike
a
southeasterly
blow
he
was
outmaneuvered
by
the
presence
of
a
vastly
larger
british
force
than
he
had
any
reason
to
expect
and
he
was
outnumbered
almost
two
to
one
through
the
apple
and
pear
orchards
of
la
trétoire
the
battle
was
sanguinary
the
british
reenforced
on
september
by
some
french
divisions
swept
through
the
terrain
in
widely
extended
lines
for
close
formation
was
not
to
be
thought
of
with
artillery
and
machine
guns
in
front
it
was
bitter
fighting
and
the
german
right
contested
every
inch
of
ground
stubbornly
once
indeed
it
seemed
that
general
von
kluck
would
turn
the
tables
he
rapidly
collected
his
retreating
troops
and
with
unparalleled
suddenness
hurled
them
back
upon
the
advancing
first
corps
under
sir
douglas
haig
aeroplane
scouts
decided
the
issue
had
the
british
been
compelled
to
await
the
onset
or
had
they
been
forced
to
depend
on
cavalry
patrols
there
would
have
been
no
opportunity
to
resist
that
revengeful
onslaught
but
no
sooner
had
the
germans
begun
to
than
sir
douglas
haig
moved
his
machine
guns
to
the
front
and
fell
back
a
few
hundred
yards
to
a
better
position
this
happened
on
september
and
may
be
regarded
as
the
last
offensive
move
made
by
general
von
kluck
army
in
the
west
on
that
same
day
coulommiers
was
invested
and
prince
eitel
compelled
to
flee
and
the
battle
of
coulommiers
was
won
chapter
xvii
continuation
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
the
third
part
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
called
by
some
the
battle
of
montmirail
was
not
marked
by
special
incident
general
part
was
to
hold
firm
and
this
he
did
not
only
by
reason
of
the
british
assistance
on
the
left
but
also
because
the
strong
army
of
general
foch
to
the
right
was
a
new
army
of
greater
strength
than
was
known
to
general
von
moltke
and
the
german
general
staff
the
battle
of
montmirail
was
won
by
the
steady
resistance
of
the
fifth
army
to
the
hammer
blows
of
the
german
right
and
to
the
quick
advantage
seized
by
general
when
the
british
weakened
the
flank
of
the
force
opposing
him
on
september
general
had
not
only
held
his
ground
but
had
driven
general
von
kluck
back
across
the
grand
morin
river
at
la
and
also
across
the
petit
morin
at
montmirail
since
the
british
had
butted
the
germans
back
from
the
petit
morin
at
la
trétoire
these
three
days
of
fighting
in
the
battles
of
coulommiers
and
montmirail
had
won
the
allies
advanced
positions
across
two
rivers
and
had
so
weakened
the
german
right
that
it
was
compelled
to
fall
back
on
the
main
army
and
forego
its
important
strategic
advantage
on
the
east
bank
of
the
ourcq
river
these
three
battles
ourcq
coulommiers
and
montmirail
constitute
the
recoil
from
paris
and
at
the
same
time
they
constitute
the
defeat
of
what
was
hereinbefore
shown
to
be
one
of
the
four
fundamentals
of
the
great
german
campaign
plan
with
the
situation
thus
cleared
so
to
speak
one
may
now
pass
to
the
details
of
the
second
part
of
the
german
plan
which
was
to
engage
the
powerful
ninth
and
fourth
armies
under
the
command
of
generals
foch
and
langle
respectively
to
break
through
them
if
possible
but
at
all
hazards
to
keep
them
sufficiently
menaced
to
disable
general
joffre
from
sending
reenforcements
therefrom
to
the
army
of
general
sarrail
on
which
the
whole
force
of
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
was
to
be
hurled
the
next
section
of
the
allied
armies
then
was
general
ninth
army
which
encountered
the
german
drive
at
fère
champenoise
and
which
resulted
in
the
severe
handling
of
general
von
forces
with
characteristic
perception
of
the
difference
between
a
greater
and
a
lesser
encounter
general
foch
called
his
share
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
the
affair
of
the
marshes
of
st
gond
this
did
not
culminate
until
wednesday
september
so
that
the
german
retreat
there
was
one
day
later
than
the
final
retreat
of
general
von
kluck
the
clash
between
the
armies
of
general
von
bülow
and
of
general
foch
began
as
did
the
battle
wrath
along
the
whole
front
at
dawn
of
that
fateful
sunday
september
general
foch
a
writer
on
strategy
had
devised
his
army
for
defense
he
was
well
supplied
with
the
famous
guns
holding
them
massed
in
the
center
of
his
line
his
extreme
right
and
left
were
mobile
and
thrown
partly
forward
to
feel
the
attack
of
the
invading
army
but
in
spite
of
all
preparations
general
foch
found
himself
to
hold
his
own
on
september
and
the
battle
continued
incessantly
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
for
the
artillerists
had
found
each
other
range
there
was
comparatively
little
fighting
at
this
point
general
foch
only
once
being
successful
in
luring
the
germans
to
within
close
firing
range
the
results
were
withering
and
general
von
bülow
did
not
attempt
it
a
second
time
there
seems
reason
to
believe
that
general
von
bülow
had
counted
upon
acting
as
a
reserve
force
to
general
von
kluck
during
the
latter
advance
and
that
consequently
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
risk
heavy
loss
of
life
until
he
knew
the
situation
to
westward
of
him
there
was
some
sharp
bomb
work
at
fère
champenoise
on
september
and
then
came
the
night
of
the
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
close
of
the
battle
of
montmirail
on
the
evening
of
september
the
western
flank
of
von
army
had
been
exposed
by
the
advance
of
general
and
the
retreat
of
general
von
kluck
information
of
this
reached
foch
and
despite
the
danger
of
the
maneuver
he
thrust
out
his
mobile
left
like
a
great
tongue
that
night
the
weather
turned
stormy
facilitating
this
move
at
one
in
the
morning
the
statement
has
been
made
word
reached
general
foch
indirectly
that
air
patrols
had
observed
a
gap
in
the
alignment
of
the
german
armies
between
general
von
bülow
left
and
general
von
hausen
right
during
the
darkness
and
the
rain
therefore
general
foch
had
worked
two
complete
surprises
on
general
von
bülow
he
had
enveloped
the
german
commander
right
flank
and
was
safely
ensconced
there
with
general
army
behind
him
since
the
latter
had
by
now
advanced
to
montmirail
at
the
same
time
he
had
thrust
a
wedge
between
von
bülow
and
general
von
hausen
threatening
general
von
bülow
left
flank
as
well
the
first
was
a
seizure
of
an
opportunity
executed
with
military
promptness
the
second
was
a
bold
and
its
risk
might
well
have
appalled
a
less
experienced
general
considering
the
westernmost
of
these
movements
first
it
will
be
seen
at
once
how
the
enveloping
action
brought
about
the
affair
of
the
marshes
of
st
gond
general
von
bülow
army
was
stretched
in
an
arc
around
the
marshes
which
it
will
be
remembered
have
been
described
as
a
pocket
of
clay
lands
mainly
reclaimed
but
which
become
miry
during
heavy
rains
it
was
general
von
misfortune
that
on
the
very
night
that
his
flank
was
exposed
there
should
come
a
torrential
downpour
these
same
marshes
had
figured
more
than
once
before
in
france
military
history
and
general
foch
as
a
master
strategist
was
determined
that
they
should
serve
again
when
the
rain
came
he
thanked
his
lucky
stars
and
acted
on
the
instant
when
the
morning
of
september
dawned
the
left
wing
of
general
foch
army
was
not
only
covering
the
exposed
flank
of
general
von
bülow
forces
but
parts
of
it
were
two
miles
to
the
rear
under
the
driving
rain
morning
broke
slowly
and
almost
before
a
sodden
and
world
could
awake
to
the
fact
that
day
had
come
general
foch
had
nipped
the
rear
of
the
flank
of
the
opposing
army
and
was
bending
the
arc
in
upon
itself
under
normal
circumstances
such
an
action
would
tend
but
to
strengthen
the
army
thus
attacked
since
it
brings
all
parts
of
the
army
into
closer
communication
but
general
foch
knew
that
the
disadvantages
of
the
ground
would
more
than
compensate
for
this
since
the
two
horns
of
general
von
bülow
army
could
not
combine
without
crossing
those
marshes
now
boggy
enough
and
growing
boggier
every
second
the
task
was
harder
than
general
foch
anticipated
for
the
same
rainy
conditions
that
provided
a
pitfall
for
the
germans
were
also
a
manifest
hindrance
to
the
rapid
execution
of
military
maneuvers
but
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
by
evening
of
that
day
the
flank
broke
and
gave
way
and
two
entire
corps
from
general
von
bülow
right
were
precipitated
into
the
marshes
forty
guns
were
taken
to
that
time
the
largest
capture
of
artillery
made
by
the
allies
and
a
number
of
prisoners
hundreds
perished
miserably
but
general
foch
held
back
his
artillery
from
an
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
men
made
helpless
in
the
slimy
mud
thus
ended
the
affair
of
the
marshes
of
gond
which
broke
still
further
the
german
right
wing
thanks
to
general
foch
further
activities
general
von
bülow
had
troubles
upon
his
left
wing
when
dawn
of
this
same
day
or
torrential
rain
september
broke
over
the
that
runs
from
mareuil
to
at
which
point
lay
the
left
of
general
von
bülow
army
it
witnessed
a
number
of
guns
on
selected
gun
sites
commanding
the
right
flank
of
the
german
right
center
general
foch
daring
the
success
of
the
maneuver
and
the
fact
that
the
conduct
of
all
the
french
armies
on
that
day
and
the
day
following
seems
to
be
with
the
full
cognizance
of
this
venture
led
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
those
brilliant
feats
conceived
by
general
foch
had
been
communicated
to
general
joffre
in
time
for
the
french
general
staff
to
direct
the
french
armies
to
the
right
and
left
of
general
foch
to
cooperate
with
his
action
had
general
foch
been
less
ably
supported
his
wedge
might
have
proved
a
weak
salient
open
to
attack
on
both
sides
but
general
foch
main
army
to
the
west
kept
general
von
bülow
busy
and
general
langle
army
to
the
east
fought
too
stubbornly
for
the
duke
of
württemberg
to
dare
detach
any
forces
for
the
relief
of
general
von
bülow
general
von
hausen
saxon
army
was
weak
at
best
what
were
the
forces
that
operated
to
make
this
particular
point
so
weak
are
not
generally
known
as
however
the
divisions
from
alsace
were
much
in
evidence
three
or
four
days
later
it
is
more
than
probable
that
these
divisions
were
intended
for
service
at
this
point
and
also
to
reenforce
general
von
kluck
army
but
that
by
the
quick
offensive
assumed
by
general
joffre
on
the
ourcq
and
owing
to
the
roundabout
nature
of
the
german
means
of
communication
these
expected
reenforcements
had
not
arrived
the
german
official
dispatches
point
out
that
general
von
bülow
retreat
was
necessitated
by
the
retreat
of
general
von
kluck
of
this
there
is
no
doubt
but
even
military
necessity
does
not
quite
explain
why
general
von
bülow
bolted
so
precipitately
his
losses
were
fearful
and
the
offensive
of
general
foch
rendered
it
necessary
for
the
germans
to
fall
back
on
the
aisne
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
and
of
the
crown
prince
may
be
considered
together
for
they
were
combined
in
an
effort
to
pierce
the
french
line
near
the
angle
at
general
langle
held
on
desperately
against
the
repeated
attacks
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
ground
was
lost
and
recovered
lost
again
and
recovered
and
every
trifling
vantage
point
of
ground
was
fought
for
with
a
bitter
intensity
though
active
with
all
the
other
armies
on
september
and
it
was
not
until
september
that
general
langle
found
himself
strained
to
his
utmost
nerve
if
he
could
hold
he
could
do
no
more
and
when
night
fell
on
september
no
person
was
more
relieved
than
general
langle
yet
the
next
day
was
even
worse
instead
of
slackening
in
the
evil
weather
the
german
drive
became
more
furious
the
exhausted
fourth
army
fought
as
though
in
a
hideous
nightmare
defended
their
lines
in
a
sullen
obstinacy
that
seemed
almost
stuporous
and
countercharged
in
a
blind
frenzy
that
approached
to
delirium
it
was
doubtful
if
general
army
could
hold
out
much
longer
but
when
general
von
bülow
was
compelled
to
retreat
when
general
foch
turned
his
attention
to
general
von
hausen
saxon
army
and
when
general
joffre
found
himself
in
a
position
to
rush
reenforcements
and
reserves
to
the
aid
of
general
langle
a
new
color
was
given
to
the
affair
the
defense
stiffened
and
as
rapidly
as
it
stiffened
so
much
the
more
did
it
become
patent
that
the
duke
of
württemberg
could
not
afford
to
be
in
an
exposed
position
far
in
advance
of
all
the
other
attacking
armies
wednesday
september
revealed
to
the
german
center
the
need
of
falling
back
on
the
crown
prince
army
which
was
the
pivot
on
which
the
whole
campaign
swung
meantime
the
crown
prince
army
had
been
steadily
victorious
the
weak
french
army
under
general
sarrail
had
been
pushed
back
yielding
only
foot
by
foot
back
back
along
the
rugged
hill
country
of
the
meuse
a
determined
stand
was
made
to
protect
the
little
fort
of
troyon
ten
miles
south
of
verdun
for
had
the
germans
succeeded
in
taking
this
verdun
would
have
been
surrounded
no
army
and
no
generalship
could
have
done
more
than
the
third
army
and
general
sarrail
did
but
they
could
not
hold
their
ground
before
troyon
on
september
the
way
to
troyon
was
open
and
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
prepared
to
demolish
it
then
came
september
when
the
allied
successes
in
the
western
part
of
the
marne
valley
allowed
them
to
send
reenforcements
thus
the
third
army
was
perceptibly
strengthened
and
hope
for
troyon
grew
one
day
more
certainly
two
days
more
and
nothing
could
have
saved
troyon
but
with
the
whole
german
line
in
retreat
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
could
not
be
left
on
the
advance
incredible
though
it
may
seem
when
the
army
of
the
crown
prince
besieging
troyon
withdrew
that
little
fort
was
a
mere
heap
of
ruins
there
were
exactly
men
left
in
the
fort
and
four
serviceable
guns
even
a
small
storming
party
could
have
carried
it
without
the
least
trouble
and
its
natural
strength
could
have
been
fortified
in
such
wise
as
to
make
it
a
pivotal
point
from
which
to
harry
verdun
at
the
extreme
east
on
that
ring
of
wooded
heights
known
as
the
grande
couronne
de
nancy
and
drawn
up
across
the
gap
of
nancy
the
second
french
army
under
general
de
castelnau
successfully
resisted
the
drive
of
the
crown
prince
of
bavaria
great
hopes
had
been
placed
on
this
attack
and
on
september
the
german
emperor
had
viewed
the
fight
at
nancy
from
one
of
the
neighboring
heights
surely
a
victory
for
the
german
arms
might
come
either
at
the
point
where
stood
the
german
emperor
or
where
led
the
crown
prince
but
the
fortunes
of
war
decided
otherwise
far
from
losing
at
nancy
the
french
took
the
offensive
after
an
artillery
duel
of
terrific
magnitude
they
drove
the
bavarian
army
from
the
forests
of
champenous
and
took
amance
the
line
of
the
meurthe
was
then
found
untenable
by
the
germans
and
on
september
general
de
castelnau
reoccupied
the
town
of
luneville
which
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
since
august
with
general
von
kluck
in
retreat
on
september
general
von
bülow
hastening
to
the
rear
on
september
with
the
duke
of
württemberg
falling
back
on
september
and
the
imperial
crown
prince
and
the
bavarian
crown
prince
retreating
to
an
inner
ring
of
defense
on
september
the
battles
of
the
marne
may
in
a
measure
be
said
to
have
concluded
as
however
the
new
alignments
were
made
mainly
by
reason
of
the
topographical
relationships
of
the
marne
and
the
aisne
rivers
and
the
territory
contiguous
thereto
it
is
perhaps
more
in
keeping
with
the
movement
to
carry
forward
the
german
retreat
across
the
marne
as
a
part
of
the
same
group
of
conflicts
chapter
xviii
other
aspects
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
in
dealing
with
a
battle
as
important
as
that
of
the
marne
points
of
view
are
valuable
we
therefore
follow
with
an
account
of
its
general
course
and
description
of
its
main
features
by
a
french
military
writer
whose
knowledge
is
based
on
information
that
is
largely
official
before
the
german
armies
he
says
became
engulfed
in
the
vast
depression
that
stretches
from
paris
to
verdun
general
joffre
with
admirable
foresight
had
brought
together
a
powerful
army
commanded
by
general
manoury
and
having
as
its
support
the
fortified
camp
of
paris
as
soon
as
general
von
kluck
turning
momentarily
from
the
road
to
the
french
capital
and
bending
his
march
to
the
southeast

bare

joffre
vigorously
launched
against
his
flank
the
entire
army
of
general
manoury
the
brilliant
offensive
of
this
army
achieved
success
from
the
beginning
it
threw
back
the
german
forces
von
kluck
perceived
the
danger
that
threatened
him
and
the
danger
was
serious
for
it
only
required
that
manoury
should
advance
a
little
further
and
he
would
have
been
almost
totally
defeated
resolutely
energetically
and
with
a
to
which
homage
must
be
rendered
von
kluck
proceeded
to
circumvent
this
danger
he
ordered
back
to
the
north
two
of
his
army
corps
recrossed
the
marne
and
threw
himself
with
intrepidity
on
manoury
but
the
retreat
of
these
two
army
corps
allowed
general
french
and
general
franchet
both
to
drive
forward
vigorously
something
resembling
the
phenomenon
of
a
whirlwind
then
took
place
in
the
german
ranks
the
british
army
made
progress
toward
the
north
the
fifth
french
army
commanded
by
general
franchet
did
the
same
general
manoury
assisted
by
all
the
troops
that
general
gallieni
was
able
rapidly
to
put
at
his
disposal
made
headway
against
the
furious
onslaught
of
von
kluck
thus
the
entire
german
right
found
itself
in
a
most
critical
situation
it
could
not
overcome
manoury
who
was
threatening
its
communications
and
on
the
other
hand
it
found
itself
powerless
to
resist
the
victorious
advance
of
generals
french
and
de
franchet
it
was
the
critical
moment
of
the
battle
the
german
general
staff
decided
that
there
was
only
one
method
of
putting
an
end
to
it
and
that
was
to
direct
against
the
army
of
general
foch
in
the
center
an
offensive
so
violent
that
the
center
would
be
pierced
and
the
french
armies
cut
in
two
if
this
attack
succeeded
it
would
free
at
once
the
german
right
and
separate
into
two
impotent
parts
the
entire
french
military
force
during
the
and
of
september
the
imperial
prussian
guard
directed
to
the
compassing
of
that
end
all
its
energy
and
courage
all
in
vain
general
foch
not
only
checked
the
german
onslaught
but
drove
it
back
thus
the
french
center
was
not
pierced
von
kluck
was
not
relieved
and
he
found
himself
in
a
position
that
grew
more
and
more
critical
the
general
retreat
of
the
german
armies
was
the
inevitable
result
to
this
decision
the
german
general
staff
came
and
on
the
evening
of
september
orders
were
given
to
all
the
armies
of
the
right
and
center
to
retire
sixty
kilometers
to
the
rear
thus
the
battle
of
the
marne
was
won
by
the
french
the
writer
then
goes
on
to
say
it
was
on
september
toward
the
end
of
the
morning
that
the
general
order
of
general
joffre
leading
to
the
great
battle
reached
the
french
armies
each
separate
army
immediately
turned
and
vigorously
engaged
in
battle
the
army
of
manoury
the
first
to
get
ready
sprang
forward
to
the
attack
it
thrust
back
the
german
forces
which
were
at
first
inferior
in
number
and
it
attained
on
the
evening
of
the
the
front
but
von
kluck
threw
two
army
corps
over
the
marne
and
hurled
himself
on
manoury
he
summoned
from
compiègne
all
the
reenforcements
at
his
disposal
and
he
placed
all
his
heavy
artillery
between
vareddes
and
during
the
day
of
september
manoury
made
headway
toward
the
ourcq
on
the
following
day
he
advanced
at
a
lesser
pace
on
its
left
bank
taking
and
then
losing
the
villages
of
marcilly
and
chambry
murderous
struggles
maintained
amid
terrible
heat
general
gallieni
who
followed
the
battle
with
the
utmost
attention
hurriedly
came
to
the
assistance
of
manoury
he
sent
to
him
on
the
and
the
seventh
division
which
had
just
arrived
at
paris
half
of
the
division
being
transferred
by
rail
the
other
half
by
means
of
thousands
of
automobiles
requisitioned
for
the
purpose
general
joffre
likewise
sent
to
manoury
the
fourth
army
corps
recruited
from
the
third
army
though
an
almost
entire
division
of
it
was
called
for
by
the
british
to
safeguard
the
junction
of
forces
the
day
of
september
turned
out
the
most
arduous
for
manoury
the
germans
making
attacks
of
extreme
violence
won
some
success
they
occupied
betz
and
yon
kluck
attacked
all
his
force
on
the
right
and
it
was
at
that
time
he
who
threatened
manoury
with
an
encircling
movement
the
fourth
french
army
corps
sent
forward
at
full
speed
by
general
joffre
and
arriving
at
the
spot
had
the
order
to
allow
itself
to
be
killed
to
the
last
man
but
to
maintain
its
ground
it
maintained
it
it
succeeded
toward
evening
in
checking
the
advance
of
the
germans
in
a
brilliant
action
the
army
of
manoury
took
three
standards
it
rallied
the
main
body
of
its
forces
on
the
left
and
prepared
for
a
new
attack
during
this
time
the
british
army
following
on
the
retreat
of
part
of
the
forces
of
von
kluck
was
able
to
make
headway
toward
the
north
it
was
the
same
with
the
fifth
french
army
the
british
leaving
behind
it
on
september
the
line
reached
in
the
evening
the
south
bank
of
the
great
morin
on
the
and
they
continued
their
march
on
the
they
debouched
to
the
north
of
the
marne
below
château
thierry
flanking
the
german
forces
which
on
that
day
were
opposing
the
army
of
manoury
it
was
then
that
the
german
forces
began
to
retreat
while
the
british
army
pursuing
the
enemy
took
seven
cannon
and
many
prisoners
and
reached
the
aisne
between
soissons
and
longueval
the
british
army
continued
till
before
coulommiers
and
after
a
brilliant
struggle
forced
the
passage
of
the
little
morin
the
fifth
french
army
under
general
franchet
made
the
same
advance
it
drove
back
the
three
active
army
corps
of
the
germans
and
the
reserve
corps
that
it
found
facing
it
on
september
it
pressed
forward
to
the
line
during
the
days
that
followed
it
reached
and
crossed
the
marne
capturing
in
fierce
combats
some
howitzers
and
machine

general
foch
showed
admirable
and
energy
at
the
most
critical
moment
the
decisive
hour
of
the
battle
he
accomplished
a
magnificent
maneuver
which
is
known
under
the
name
of
the
of
fère
foch
noted
a
rift
between
the
german
army
of
von
bülow
and
that
of
von
hausen
the
german
guard
was
engaged
with
the
tenth
division
of
the
reserve
in
the
region
of
the
marshes
of
gond
on
september
foch
resolutely
threw
into
this
rift
the
division
under
general
grossetti
which
was
at
his
left
and
his
army
corps
of
the
left
he
thus
made
a
flank
attack
on
the
german
forces
notably
the
guard
which
had
bent
back
his
army
corps
on
the
right
the
effect
produced
by
the
flank
attack
of
manoury
on
the
right
of
general
von
kluck
army
was
renewed
here
the
enemy
taken
aback
by
this
audacious
maneuver
did
not
resist
and
made
a
precipitate
retreat
on
the
evening
of
the
the
game
was
thus
lost
to
the
germans
their
armies
of
the
right
and
of
the
center
were
beaten
and
the
retreat
followed
the
imperial
guard
left
in
the
marshes
of

more
than
men
and
almost
all
its
artillery
victory
henceforth
began
to
perch
on
the
allied
banners
over
all
the
vast
battle
field
such
was
this
battle
of
seven
days
in
which
almost
men
were
engaged
if
it
is
examined
in
its
ensemble
it
will
be
seen
that
each
french
army
advanced
step
by
step
opening
up
the
road
to
the
neighboring
army

immediately
gave
it
support

crossing

in
order
to
gain
a
clear
idea
of
what
was
involved
in
the
feat
of
crossing
the
aisne
which
more
than
one
expert
has
declared
to
be
the
greatest
military
feat
in
river
crossing
in
the
history
of
arms
it
is
well
to
look
at
the
topography
of
that
point
first
in
its
relation
to
the
whole
german
line
and
second
in
its
relation
to
possible
attack
in
september
the
prepared
positions
on
the
aisne
to
which
the
germans
fell
back
after
the
battle
of
the
marne
were
along
a
line
of
exceptionally
strong
natural
barriers
the
line
extends
from
a
point
north
of
verdun
on
the
heights
of
the
meuse
across
the
wooded
country
of
the
argonne
and
the
plain
of
champagne
to
rheims
thence
northwest
to
brimont
crossing
the
aisne
near
its
confluence
with
the
suippe
and
from
thence
proceeding
to
craonne
whence
it
takes
a
westerly
course
along
the
heights
of
the
aisne
to
the
forest
of
the
eagle
north
of
compiègne
the
eastern
end
of
this
line
has
already
been
described
in
connection
with
the
battles
of
the
marne
and
it
is
the
western
section
of
this
line
which
now
demands
consideration
just
as
the
river
marne
was
taken
as
a
basis
for
the
consideration
of
the
topography
of
the
battles
that
centered
round
the
crossing
of
the
ourcq
grand
morin
petit
morin
and
the
marne
so
the
aisne
is
naturally
the
most
important
determinant
in
the
problems
of
its
crossing
the
river
aisne
rises
in
the
argonne
southwest
of
verdun
through
the
champagne
region
its
banks
are
of
gradual
slope
but
shortly
after
it
passes
rethel
on
its
westerly
course
the
configuration
changes
sharply
and
at
craonne
the
bluffs
overlooking
the
river
are
feet
high
it
is
easy
to
see
what
an
inaccessible
barrier
is
made
by
such
a
line
of
cliffs
for
forty
miles
this
line
of
bluffs
continues
almost
reaching
to
compiègne
where
the
aisne
enters
the
oise
not
only
are
the
banks
of
the
aisne
thus
guarded
by
steep
bluffs
but
the
character
of
those
bluffs
is
peculiarly
fitted
for
military
purposes
for
long
stretches
along
the
north
side
the
cliffs
stand
sheer
and
have
spurs
that
dip
down
sharply
to
the
valley
the
ridge
or
the
top
of
the
bluff
which
looks
from
below
like
the
scarp
of
a
great
plateau
lies
at
an
average
of
a
mile
or
more
from
the
stream
many
of
these
spurs
jut
out
in
such
a
way
that
if
fortified
they
could
enfilade
up
and
downstream
to
add
to
the
military
value
of
such
a
barrier
the
edge
of
the
scarp
is
heavily
wooded
while
the
lower
slopes
are
steep
and
grassy
with
small
woods
at
irregular
intervals
even
from
the
high
ground
on
the
south
bank
of
the
stream
the
top
of
the
plateau
on
the
north
can
not
be
seen
and
from
below
it
is
effectually
cloaked
two
tributaries
are
to
be
considered
in
this
river
valley
which
thus
forms
so
natural
a
post
of
defense
both
flow
in
from
the
south
the
suippe
which
joins
the
main
stream
at
and
the
vesle
on
which
stands
the
ancient
city
of
rheims
this
river
joins
the
aisne
a
little
over
seven
miles
east
of
soissons
which
is
itself
twenty
miles
east
of
compiègne
the
line
taken
by
the
german
armies
for
their
stand
was
not
the
river
itself
but
the
northern
ridge
at
no
place
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
river
it
was
always
within
gunfire
of
any
crossing
every
place
of
crossing
was
commanded
by
a
spur
every
road
on
the
north
bank
was
in
their
hands
every
road
on
the
south
bank
curved
upward
so
as
to
be
a
fair
mark
for
their
artillery
as
the
german
drive
advanced
a
huge
body
of
sappers
and
miners
had
been
left
behind
to
fortify
this
aisne
line
and
the
system
developed
was
much
the
same
along
its
entire
distance
there
were
two
lines
of
entanglements
one
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
which
would
prevent
fording
or
swimming
and
which
being
under
water
could
not
easily
be
destroyed
by
gunfire
from
the
southern
bank
above
this
was
a
heavy
and
entanglement
partly
sunk
and
concealed
from
view
in
many
places
pitted
and
covered
with
brushwood
above
this
following
approximately
a
contour
came
a
line
of
trenches
for
infantry
and
fifty
yards
behind
a
second
line
of
trenches
commanding
a
further
elevation
of
fifty
feet
of
the
way
up
the
hill
came
the
quarters
the
kitchens
the
bakeries
the
dormitories
and
so
forth
and
the
crest
of
the
hill
bristled
along
its
entire
length
with
field
guns
effectually
screened
by
trees
on
the
further
side
of
the
ridge
in
chalk
pits
were
the
great
howitzers
tossing
their
huge
shells
over
the
ridge
and
its
defenses
into
the
river
itself
and
even
on
the
south
bank
beyond
truly
a
position
of
power
and
one
that
the
boldest
of
troops
might
hesitate
to
attack
it
is
quite
possible
that
had
the
entire
strength
of
the
german
position
been
known
no
attempt
to
cross
would
have
been
made
but
there
was
always
a
possibility
that
the
counterchecks
of
the
german
army
were
no
more
than
the
actions
of
the
three
or
four
days
immediately
preceding
yet
sir
john
french
seems
to
have
expected
the
true
state
of
affairs
for
he
remarks
in
his
dispatches
the
battles
of
the
marne
which
lasted
from
the
morning
of
the
to
the
evening
of
the
had
hardly
ended
in
the
precipitate
flight
of
the
enemy
when
we
were
brought
face
to
face
with
a
position
of
extraordinary
strength
carefully
intrenched
and
prepared
for
defense
by
an
army
and
staff
which
are
thorough
adepts
in
such
work
yet
it
was
evident
that
if
the
armies
of
the
allies
were
to
secure
any
lasting
benefit
from
the
battles
of
the
marne
they
must
dislodge
the
invading
hosts
from
their
new
vantage
ground
it
was
obvious
that
the
task
was
one
of
great
peril
and
one
necessarily
likely
to
be
attended
with
heavy
loss
of
life
sir
john
french
knowing
the
tactical
value
of
driving
a
fleeing
army
hard
determined
on
forcing
the
issue
without
delay
before
proceeding
to
recount
in
detail
the
events
of
that
six
battle
of
the
aisne
which
little
by
little
solidified
into
an
impasse
it
might
be
well
to
trace
the
new
positions
that
had
been
taken
by
the
respective
armies
engaged
in
the
struggle
for
the
supremacy
of
western
europe
general
von
kluck
still
in
charge
of
the
first
german
army
was
in
control
of
the
western
section
from
the
forest
of
the
eagle
to
the
plateau
of
craonne
he
had
forced
his
men
to
almost
superhuman
efforts
and
by
midnight
of
september
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
most
of
his
artillery
across
the
aisne
at
soissons
and
had
whipped
his
infantry
into
place
on
the
heights
north
of
the
stream
that
with
his
exhausted
troops
he
succeeded
remains
still
a
tribute
to
his
power
as
a
commander
but
the
men
were
done
further
attack
meant
rout
his
salvation
lay
in
his
heavy
field
guns
and
howitzers
an
arm
of
the
service
in
which
the
french
army
under
general
maunoury
and
general
pau
who
had
taken
a
superior
command
during
the
turning
of
the
german
drive
at
the
marne
was
notoriously
weak
still
there
was
little
comfort
there
for
the
british
army
was
well
supplied
with
heavy
artillery
and
the
fifth
french
army
of
general
also
coming
up
to
confront
him
was
not
entirely
lacking
in
this
branch
of
the
service
general
von
bülow
army
was
combined
with
that
of
general
von
hausen
who
fell
ill
and
was
retired
from
his
command
against
this
combined
army
was
ranged
the
victorious
and
still
fresh
army
of
general
foch
lacking
two
corps
which
had
been
detached
for
reserves
elsewhere
one
of
these
corps
apparently
went
to
the
aid
of
general
sarrail
whose
stand
was
still
a
weak
point
in
the
line
general
sarrail
however
was
now
better
supported
by
the
movement
of
general
langle
with
the
fourth
french
army
who
advanced
toward
troyon
and
confronted
the
combined
armies
of
the
imperial
crown
prince
and
the
duke
of
württemberg
this
released
general
sarrail
to
his
task
of
intrenching
and
enlarging
the
defenses
about
verdun
the
importance
of
which
had
become
more
poignant
than
ever
before
in
the
events
of
the
past
week
the
far
eastern
end
of
the
line
remained
unchanged
the
credit
for
the
crossing
of
the
aisne
lies
with
the
british
troops
the
battles
of
the
marne
had
thrust
sir
john
french
into
a
prominent
position
wherein
he
was
able
to
achieve
a
result
without
any
great
loss
of
life
but
the
battle
of
the
aisne
was
different
it
was
a
magnificent
effort
boldly
carried
out
and
as
was
afterward
learned
it
could
not
have
been
successful
had
the
onset
been
delayed
even
one
day
general
maunoury
army
encamped
in
the
forest
of
the
compiègne
was
again
the
first
to
give
battle
as
it
had
been
in
the
battles
of
the
marne
using
some
heavy
guns
that
had
been
sent
on
from
paris
in
addition
to
the
batteries
that
had
been
lent
him
by
the
british
he
secured
some
artillery
positions
on
the
south
bank
and
spent
the
morning
in
a
duel
with
the
german
gunners
near
soissons
the
germans
had
not
all
taken
up
their
positions
on
the
north
side
of
the
aisne
on
the
morning
of
september
and
the
heavy
battery
of
the
fourth
british
division
did
good
service
early
in
the
morning
dislodging
some
of
these
before
it
wheeled
in
line
beside
the
big
french
guns
in
an
endeavor
to
shell
the
trenches
and
level
the
entanglements
that
an
opportunity
might
be
made
to
cross
but
the
results
were
not
encouraging
of
success
for
the
reply
from
the
further
shore
was
terrific
general
von
kluck
army
might
be
worn
out
but
the
iron
throats
of
his
guns
were
untiring
and
he
knew
that
huge
reenforcements
were
on
the
way
chapter
xx
first
day
battles
that
first
day
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
september
which
was
indeed
rather
preparatory
than
actual
was
also
marked
by
some
unusually
brilliant
cavalry
work
in
general
allenby
division
the
german
line
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
aisne
but
all
the
hill
country
between
the
marne
and
the
aisne
had
to
be
cleared
of
the
powerful
rear
guards
of
the
retreating
german
army
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
the
advance
guards
of
the
new
german
line
early
in
the
morning
the
cavalry
under
general
allenby
swept
out
from
the
town
of
braisne
on
the
vesle
and
harried
in
every
direction
the
strong
detachments
that
had
been
sent
forward
driving
them
back
to
the
aisne
over
the
high
wooded
ridge
between
the
vesle
and
the
aisne
the
germans
were
driven
back
and
the
third
division
under
general
hamilton
supported
the
cavalry
in
force
so
that
by
the
evening
general
hamilton
division
was
able
to
camp
below
the
hill
of
brenelle
and
even
before
night
fell
to
get
their
guns
upon
that
height
from
which
they
could
reply
to
the
german
batteries
snugly
ensconced
upon
the
frowning
ridge
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
aisne
the
fifth
british
division
under
sir
charles
fergusson
found
itself
in
a
tight
place
at
the
confluence
of
the
vesle
and
aisne
rivers
for
at
that
point
lay
a
stretch
of
flat
bottomland
exposed
to
the
german
fire
by
a
ruse
which
returned
upon
their
own
heads
the
germans
had
preserved
one
bridge
across
the
aisne
the
bridge
at
condé
this
was
done
as
a
lure
to
sir
charles
fergusson
forces
but
even
more
so
it
was
intended
as
a
sallying
point
as
soon
as
the
german
army
deemed
itself
in
a
position
to
attack
again
the
bridge
was
destined
to
figure
in
the
events
of
the
great
conflict
when
the
grapple
should
come
one
of
the
most
graphic
of
all
the
accounts
of
the
fighting
of
that
day
was
from
the
pen
of
a
major
in
the
british
field
artillery
and
it
presented
in
sharp
and
vivid
colors
how
the
field
artillery
joined
with
the
cavalry
in
clearing
the
german
troops
from
the
hills
between
the
marne
and
the
aisne
he
wrote
we
got
the
order
to
go
off
and
join
a
battery
under
colonel
orders
we
came
en
route
under
heavy
shrapnel
fire
on
the
road
i
gave
the
order
to
walk
as
the
horses
had
hardly
had
any
food
for
a
couple
of
days
and
also
i
wanted
to
steady
the
show
i
say
i
enjoyed
walking
along
at
the
head
with
old
behind
me
especially
when
six
shrapnel
burst
right
in
front
of
us
we
got
there
just
in
time
rushed
into
action
and
opened
fire
on
a
german
counterattack
at
short
range
destroying
the
lot
so
far
as
i
could
see
we
then
moved
slightly
to
another
position
to
take
on
a
valley
down
which
they
were
attacking
and
were
at
it
the
whole
day
firing
about
rounds
into
quantities
of
german
attacks
and
counterattacks
they
can
not
stand
the
shrapnel
and
the
moment
i
got
one
on
them
they
turned
and
bolted
back
to
the
wood
i
got
on
to
their
trenches
one
shell
dropped
in
it
would
appear
from
this
that
some
of
the
advance
guards
of
the
new
defense
line
were
either
intrenching
or
occupying
trenches
made
during
the
battles
of
the
marne
probably
the
latter
or
else
the
writer
is
speaking
of
the
actions
of
his
battery
on
the
as
well
as
the
before
the
invaders
had
retreated
across
the
marne
i
was
enfilading
them
and
they
tore
out
of
the
trenches
and
so
on
each
trench
in
turn
and
fell
in
hundreds
also
through
the
range
finder
saw
i
hit
a
machine
gun
and
they
had
abandoned
it
and
another
so
it
went
all
day
shells
and
bullets
humming
around
but
only
one
of
my
staff
horses
was
hit
our
infantry
advancing
and
retiring
others
advancing
and
coming
back
germans
doing
likewise
a
hellish
din
of
shell
fire
and
me
pouring
in
fire
whenever
i
could
see
them
at
last
i
got
six
shrapnel
into
a
wood
and
cleared
a
heap
of
them
out
and
got
into
them
with
shrapnel
it
was
awful
the
sergeant
major
put
his
hand
up
to
his
head
and
said
oh
sir
it
terrible
that
seemed
to
settle
them
and
at
last
we
saw
the
infantry
advancing
to
their
positions
without
resistance
now
was
my
chance
i
determined
to
get
those
machine
guns
if
i
could
as
otherwise
the
infantry
would
so
i
left
in
command
and
got
the
trumpeter
sergeant
major
and
six
men
with
six
rifles
and
went
forward
reconnoiter
as
i
reported
to
after
i
had
gone
it
was
a
weird
ride
through
thick
black
woods
holding
my
revolver
ready
going
in
front
with
the
little
trumpeter
behind
and
the
others
following
some
way
in
the
rear
we
passed
some
very
bad
sights
and
knew
the
woods
were
full
of
germans
who
were
afraid
to
get
away
on
account
of
the
dreaded
shell
fire
we
got
in
front
of
our
infantry
who
were
going
to
fire
at
us
but
i
shouted
just
in
time
at
last
we
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wood
and
in
front
of
us
about
yards
away
was
a
little
copse
and
the
trenches
with
machine
guns
a
little
farther
on
i
felt
sure
this
wood
was
full
of
germans
as
i
had
seen
them
go
in
earlier
i
started
to
gallop
for
it
and
the
others
followed
suddenly
about
fifty
germans
bolted
out
firing
at
us
i
loosed
off
my
revolver
as
fast
as
i
could
and
loosed
off
his
rifle
from
the
saddle
they
must
have
thought
we
were
a
regiment
of
cavalry
for
except
for
a
few
they
suddenly
yelled
and
bolted
i
stopped
and
dismounted
my
lot
to
fire
at
them
to
make
sure
that
they
did
change
their
minds
i
waited
for
a
lull
and
mounted
all
my
lot
behind
the
bushes
and
made
them
spring
as
i
gave
the
word
to
gallop
for
cover
to
the
woods
where
the
welsh
company
was
there
i
got
who
understands
them
the
guns
and
an
infantryman
who
volunteered
to
help
and
and
i
ran
up
to
the
maxims
and
took
out
the
breech
mechanism
of
both
and
one
of
the
belts
and
carried
away
one
whole
maxim
we
could
manage
the
other
we
got
back
very
slowly
on
account
of
the
gun
and
the
men
went
wild
with
excitement
that
we
had
got
one
gun
complete
and
the
mechanism
and
belt
of
the
other
with
such
incidents
the
pursuit
of
the
germans
across
the
marne
and
to
the
aisne
was
replete
and
so
thoroughly
did
the
advance
french
and
english
troops
scour
that
country
that
when
the
morning
of
september
dawned
there
was
scarcely
a
german
soldier
left
on
the
southern
side
of
the
aisne
west
of
rheims
the
administration
of
the
german
armies
meanwhile
had
been
markedly
changed
in
the
turning
movement
on
the
marne
the
plan
was
clearly
outlined
each
commander
had
his
instructions
and
that
was
all
but
with
the
need
for
changes
of
plan
there
was
need
for
a
directing
head
and
field
marshal
van
heeringen
was
sent
in
a
hurry
to
take
charge
of
the
aisne
this
placed
both
general
von
kluck
and
general
von
bülow
into
subordinate
positions
field
marshal
von
heeringen
held
a
deserved
reputation
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
of
the
german
military
leaders
he
had
been
the
backbone
of
the
crown
prince
movement
against
troyon
a
movement
which
given
a
day
or
two
longer
might
have
meant
the
capture
of
verdun
this
was
not
the
only
factor
that
was
framing
up
to
give
the
german
armies
a
decided
advantage
the
essential
factor
of
the
aisne
was
the
arrival
of
general
von
zwehl
and
his
guns
on
september
at
zwehl
arrived
in
laon
and
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
in
action
on
the
aisne
front
the
story
of
general
von
zwehl
and
his
guns
is
essential
to
an
understanding
of
the
causes
that
rendered
the
british
victory
of
the
aisne
a
barren
and
a
fruitless
victory
at
best
the
week
of
september
witnessed
the
entire
series
of
the
battles
of
the
marne
which
drove
the
germans
across
the
marne
and
across
the
aisne
as
well
as
a
german
victory
which
exerted
almost
as
powerful
an
influence
in
favor
of
the
invaders
as
the
check
at
the
marne
did
for
the
defenders
this
victory
was
the
fall
of
maubeuge
it
is
going
too
far
to
say
as
several
military
writers
have
done
that
general
von
zwehl
saved
germany
and
that
unless
he
had
arrived
as
opportunely
as
he
did
the
german
retreat
to
the
aisne
valley
would
have
been
changed
into
a
disastrous
and
overwhelming
rout
but
it
is
not
going
too
far
to
say
that
the
successful
holding
of
the
aisne
line
was
due
to
the
victor
of
maubeuge
general
von
zwehl
was
one
of
the
warriors
of
a
man
with
a
will
as
metallic
as
his
own
siege
guns
and
a
man
who
could
no
more
be
deflected
from
his
purpose
than
a
shell
could
be
diverted
in
its
flight
he
had
been
set
to
reduce
maubeuge
and
he
had
done
so
with
speed
and
with
thoroughness
maubeuge
was
not
protected
by
earthworks
but
by
a
circle
of
concrete
forts
to
the
mighty
siege
guns
handled
by
general
von
zwehl
these
were
no
trouble
for
von
zwehl
had
not
only
the
heavy
batteries
attached
to
the
seventh
army
reserve
but
he
also
had
a
number
of
von
kluck
guns
and
the
majority
of
general
von
bülow
neither
of
whom
was
expected
to
need
siege
guns
in
the
forward
drive
where
mobility
was
an
essential
in
addition
to
this
general
von
zwehl
also
had
the
great
siege
train
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
reduction
of
paris
what
chance
had
maubeuge
against
such
a
potency
on
september
word
reached
general
von
zwehl
that
the
forward
drive
had
failed
that
the
main
armies
had
been
beaten
back
and
that
he
was
to
bring
up
his
guns
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
cover
the
retreat
as
rapidly
as
he
could
to
general
von
zwehl
meant
but
one
thing
to
get
there
he
collected
reserve
troops
which
was
almost
immediately
swelled
by
another
and
with
a
total
of
troops
he
started
his
siege
trains
for
the
town
of
laon
where
field
marshal
von
heeringen
had
taken
up
his
headquarters
the
weather
turned
bad
rendering
the
heavy
guns
extremely
difficult
to
handle
but
there
could
be
no
delay
no
explanations
to
general
von
zwehl
if
a
gun
was
to
be
brought
it
was
to
be
brought
and
that
was
all
about
it
four
days
and
three
nights
of
almost
continuous
marching
is
killing
the
german
commander
cared
nothing
for
that
the
guns
must
be
kept
moving
could
he
get
them
there
on
time
in
the
last
hours
of
the
march
his
troops
covered
miles
and
they
arrived
in
laon
at
six
in
the
morning
of
september
and
were
in
action
an
hour
later
the
problem
therefore
before
the
english
and
french
at
the
aisne
was
not
the
carrying
of
the
river
against
a
disheartened
and
retreating
army
but
the
carrying
of
the
river
against
a
and
forceful
plan
a
plan
moreover
backed
up
by
the
most
powerful
artillery
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
chapter
xxi
the
british
at
the
aisne
in
the
battles
of
the
marne
the
brunt
of
the
fighting
had
been
borne
mainly
by
the
french
armies
but
the
major
part
of
work
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
was
borne
by
the
british
expeditionary
force
sir
john
french
wasted
no

saturday
night
september
was
a
night
of
labor
for
engineers
and
gunners
the
bridge
trains
belonging
to
the
first
and
second
army
corps
were
ordered
to
the
edge
of
the
river
at
daybreak
and
as
soon
as
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
sky
the
heroic
effort
began
at
the
risk
of
seeming
a
little
detailed
in
order
to
understand
the
somewhat
involved
maneuvers
by
which
the
british
won
the
crossing
of
the
aisne
instead
of
dealing
with
the
advance
of
the
british
army
as
a
unit

the
manner
that
was
done

was

there
was

out
a
way
alas
often
costly
a
way
that
in
every
campaign
costs
thousands
of
lives
apparently
fruitlessly
and
that
is
a
frontal
attack
down
over
the
slopes
of
the
southern
bank
into
the
bright
smiling
river
valley
where
the
little
white
villages
in
the
distance
were
hiding
their
dilapidated
state
marched
the
british
army
not
a
sign
of
activity
showed
itself
upon
the
farther
shore
a
summer
haze
obscured
objects
at
a
distance
but
shortly
before
nine
the
german
batteries
opened
fire
with
a
roar
that
was
appalling
the
third
army
corps
after
a
brief
artillery
duel
advanced
on
soissons
to
cover
the
work
of
the
engineers
who
were
building
a
pontoon
bridge
for
the
french
troops
the
german
fire
was
deadly
yet
though
more
than
half
their
men
fell
the
engineers
put
the
pontoon
bridge
across
german
howitzer
fire
from
behind
the
ridge
however
soon
destroyed
the
bridge
the
turcos
crossed
the
river
in
rowboats
and
had
a
fierce
but
indecisive
struggle
in
the
streets
of
the
medieval
city
meanwhile
with
the
failure
of
the
pontoon
bridge
at
soissons
general
pulteney
struck
to
the
northeast
along
the
road
to
venizel
the
bridge
at
that
point
had
been
blown
up
but
the
british
sappers
repaired
it
sufficiently
to
set
the
eleventh
brigade
across
and
even
despite
the
lurid
hail
of
shot
and
shell
four
regiments
gathered
at
by
one
on
that
sunday
september
over
the
heads
of
these
courageous
regiments
towered
the
great
hill
of
vregny
a
veritable
gibraltar
of
heavy
guns
with
numerous
machine
guns
along
the
wooded
edge
there
was
no
protection
and
no
shelter
against
the
terrible
german
maxim
fire
so
that
the
moment
came
when
to
attempt
further
advance
meant
instant
annihilation
still
under
cover
of
the
success
of
the
eleventh
brigade
the
engineers
built
a
pontoon
bridge
at
venizel
and
the
twelth
brigade
crossed
to
with
a
number
of
the
lighter
artillery
as
there
was
absolutely
no
shelter
to
storm
the
height
at
that
point
was
impossible
and
to
remain
where
they
were
was
merely
to
court
sudden
death
so
the
twelfth
brigade
worked
over
the
slopes
to
the
ravine
at
chipres
where
they
intrenched
the
task
in
front
of
the
second
army
corps
was
no
less
difficult
the
bridge
at
condé
was
too
strongly
defended
to
be
taken
by
assault
as
sir
horace
speedily
found
out
so
he
divided
his
forces
into
two
parts
one
of
which
was
directed
at
the
village
of
missy
two
and
one
half
miles
west
of
condé
while
the
other
concentrated
its
attack
on
a
crossing
at
the
town
of
vailly
three
miles
east
of
condé
both
detachments
made
good
their
crossing
but
the
regiments
that
found
themselves
near
missy
also
realized
that
hasty
very
hasty
intrenchment
was
imperative
lest
every
one
of
them
should
be
blown
into
kingdom
come
before
half
an
hour
had
passed
by
during
the
night
some
troops
were
rafted
over
three
men
at
a
time
and
these
encamped
near
missy
it
was
a
false
move
for
sixteen
days
thereafter
the
british
troops
had
to
remain
in
their
dugouts
a
large
part
of
the
time
without
food
or
water
to
show
a
head
above
the
trench
was
sudden
death
the
regiments
that
crossed
the
river
at
vailly
found
themselves
in
even
a
worse
plight
no
sooner
had
they
crossed
than
the
bombardment
began
and
the
germans
knew
every
range
in
the
place
accurately
more
than
that
the
line
of
trenches
was
open
to
enfilade
fire
from
a
hidden
battery
which
did
not
unmask
until
the
trench
was
filled
with
soldiers
this
eighth
brigade
had
to
retire
in
disorder
the
fifth
brigade
attached
to
the
first
army
corps
under
sir
douglas
haig
an
irish
and
scotch
group
of
regiments
were
the
most
successful
of
all
the
bridge
at
pont
arcy
had
been
destroyed
but
still
one
of
its
girders
spanned
the
stream
it
would
have
been
tricky
walking
even
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
nerve
racking
to
attempt
when
from
every
hill
and
wood
and
point
of
land
maxims
machine
guns
and
a
steady
rifle
fire
are
concentrated
on
the
man
crossing
that
one
girder
by
the
afternoon
the
engineers
attached
to
the
first
army
corps
had
also
established
a
pontoon
bridge
and
the
whole
brigade
crossed
the
river
in
the
evening
and
dug
itself
in
late
on
sunday
afternoon
however
a
weak
spot
showed
itself
in
the
german
line
and
sir
john
french
threw
the
first
division
of
the
first
army
corps
across
the
river
near
bourg
some
of
the
infantry
crossed
by
a
small
pontoon
bridge
and
a
brigade
of
cavalry
started
to
follow
them
when
they
were
in
however
a
terrific
storm
of
fire
smote
them
the
cavalry
pushed
on
but
could
not
ride
up
the
hill
in
the
teeth
of
the
bombardment
the
infantry
were
eager
to
go
but
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
the
move
so
the
cavalry
returned
over
the
pontoon
by
a
most
extraordinary
occurrence
not
having
lost
a
single
member
in
the
three
hours
it
had
been
scouting
on
the
hostile
side
of
the
aisne
the
infantry
intrenched
themselves
solidly
to
await
the
morning
the
main
forces
of
the
first
division
were
especially
lucky
using
the
canal
aqueduct
they
made
their
way
toward
bourg
and
drove
the
germans
back
toward
the
main
ridge
more
than
of
the
summit
of
the
ridge
had
been
won
the
entire
second
infantry
brigade
was
across
the
artillery
brigade
was
across
ready
to
support
and
general
bulfin
instead
of
tiring
his
men
by
making
them
intrench
there
ordered
them
to
rest
throwing
their
outposts
in
front
of
the
hamlet
of
moulins
this
ended
the
first
day
fighting
on
the
battle
of
the
aisne
of
the
third
army
corps
a
small
body
of
men
had
reached
chipres
there
they
had
been
joined
by
a
small
force
from
the
second
army
corps
in
the
first
army
a
strong
detachment
dug
itself
in
not
far
from
pont
the
incomparably
superior
position
of
the
germans
their
huge
numbers
their
possession
of
innumerable
guns
made
even
this
shaky
tenure
dangerous
though
all
held
on
sir
john
french
had
tested
and
found
out
the
german
strength
and
the
result
was
not
encouraging
although
this
repulse
of
the
british
army
at
every
point
was
a
decided
victory
for
the
german
gunners
field
marshal
von
heeringen
had
been
impressed
by
two
things
the
courage
of
the
british
attacking
army
and
the
destructiveness
of
the
french
artillery
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
the
german
commander
withdrew
all
his
men
from
the
advanced
trenches
on
between
the
ridge
and
the
river
keeping
however
strongly
intrenched
detachments
of
riflemen
at
all
commanding
points
with
powerful
artillery
as
their
support
sunday
night
was
a
veritable
pandemonium
of
destruction
and
tumult
all
night
long
without
cessation
the
batteries
of
both
sides
knowing
exactly
their
opponents
range
fired
perpetually
all
night
long
searchlight
bombs
were
thrown
all
night
long
golden
and
red
and
yellow
streams
of
flame
or
the
sudden
jagged
flash
of
an
explosion
lit
up
the
black
smoke
of
burning
buildings
and
fields
in
the
valley
or
showed
the
white
low
clouds
of
the
bursting
shrapnel
not
for
an
instant
did
the
roar
diminish
not
for
a
second
was
the
kindly
veil
of
night
left
unrent
by
a
fissure
of
vengeful
flame
yet
all
night
long
as
ceaselessly
as
the
great
guns
poured
out
their
angry
fury
so
did
men
pour
out
their
indomitable
will
and
in
that
hell
light
of
battle
flame
engineers
labored
to
construct
bridges
small
bodies
of
troops
moved
forward
to
join
their
comrades
in
the
trenches
who
had
been
able
to
make
a
footing
the
day
before
and
all
night
long
those
ghastly
yet
merciful
accompaniments
of
a
battle
field
the
ambulance
corps
carried
on
their
work
of
relief
the
searchlights
swept
up
and
down
the
valley
like
great
eyes
that
watched
to
give
direction
to
the
venom
of
war
at
three
in
the
morning
of
monday
september
two
regiments
were
sent
to
capture
a
sugar
factory
strongly
held
by
the
enemy
that
sugar
factory
became
a
maelstrom
three
more
regiments
had
to
be
brought
up
and
finally
the
guards
and
even
thus
heavily
overpowered
the
germans
successfully
defended
it
until
noon
they
sold
their
lives
dearly
those
defenders
that
sugar
factory
stood
on
that
monday
as
did
hogoumont
at
waterloo
it
delayed
the
advance
of
the
entire
first
corps
but
at
four
in
the
afternoon
sir
douglas
haig
ordered
a
general
advance
the
last
afternoon
and
evening
scored
a
distinct
success
for
the
english
arms
and
when
at
last
it
grew
absolutely
too
dark
to
see
that
corps
held
a
position
stretching
from
troton
to
la
cour
de
soupir
its
chief
importance
however
was
that
it
gave
the
allies
a
strongly
intrenched
position
on
the
plateau
itself
it
was
of
this
day
fighting
that
almost
a
month
later
sir
john
french
was
able
to
say
in
his
official
dispatches
the
action
of
the
first
corps
on
this
day
under
the
direction
and
command
of
sir
douglas
haig
was
of
so
skillful
bold
and
decisive
a
character
that
he
gained
positions
which
alone
have
enabled
me
to
maintain
my
position
for
more
than
three
weeks
of
very
severe
fighting
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
the
offensive
of
this
entire
movement
was
intrusted
to
the
first
corps
the
artillery
strength
of
the
armies
of
general
von
kluck
and
von
bülow
was
such
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
the
second
and
third
british
army
corps
to
assail
them
by
a
charge
up
the
bluff
but
meantime
the
french
had
not
been
idle
on
september
general
fifth
army
crossed
the
aisne
east
of
bourg
and
on
the
following
day
commenced
the
assault
on
the
craonne
plateau
the
next
day
tuesday
september
was
a
day
of
several
small
victories
for
the
germans
general
von
zwehl
was
a
hard
hitter
and
a
quick
hitter
having
disposed
of
his
artillery
where
he
thought
it
could
be
of
the
most
use
he
aided
field
marshal
von
heeringen
with
counsels
of
counterattack
counsels
that
the
field
marshal
fully
indorsed
the
sixth
french
army
under
general
manoury
at
the
extreme
west
of
the
line
was
the
chief
point
of
attack
though
well
placed
on
a
strong
position
at
nampcel
the
germans
drove
the
french
before
them
like
clouds
before
the
wind
recaptured
the
spurs
forced
the
french
backward
through
the
morsain
ravine
and
back
to
their
original
crossing
place
of
the
aisne
between
viv
and
fontenoy
the
third
corps
of
the
british
suffered
heavy
loss
of
life
without
any
opportunity
to
retaliate
for
it
was
too
thoroughly
and
completely
dominated
by
the
guns
of
vregny
the
lull
of
wednesday
september
was
a
foretaste
of
the
deadlock
which
was
gradually
forming
the
french
fifth
army
had
been
compelled
to
abandon
all
idea
of
a
direct
attack
upon
the
craonne
plateau
the
natural
position
being
far
too
strong
the
second
and
third
corps
of
the
british
army
could
do
nothing
sir
john
french
though
eager
to
push
the
advantage
secured
by
his
position
on
the
heights
was
well
aware
that
such
a
move
was
not
possible
unless
the
entire
french
line
was
ready
to
cooperate
with
him
for
if
he
tried
to
drive
down
upon
the
ridge
of
the
aisne
or
for
that
matter
tried
to
flank
it
the
line
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
would
bend
back
upon
him
and
nip
him
in
a
way
which
would
render
escape
difficult
a
sudden
recrudescence
of
activity
on
the
western
front
gave
rise
to
the
hope
that
the
deadlock
might
yet
be
avoided
that
the
two
great
armies
might
come
to
handgrips
again
bolstered
up
by
reenforcements
general
manoury
checked
the
german
attack
and
regained
all
the
ground
that
had
been
lost
concentrating
on
the
need
of
driving
the
invaders
out
of
the
quarries
of
autreches
the
french
succeeded
this
eased
the
western
end
of
the
line
and
the
second
and
third
british
army
corps
were
left
in
peace
friday
september
is
again
a
date
of
moment
not
because
anything
of
importance
was
transacted
but
because
nothing
was
transacted
it
was
a
day
of
realizations
it
was
a
day
that
convinced
the
allies
that
the
german
positions
could
not
be
broken
down
by
frontal
attack
just
as
the
battles
of
the
marne
had
convinced
the
germans
that
the
road
to
paris
was
not
yet
open
the
six
days
from
september
to
had
revealed
beyond
preadventure
that
the
german
line
along
the
ridge
of
the
aisne
was
not
merely
a
convenient
halting
place
for
a
action
but
that
it
was
formed
of
lines
of
strong
fortifications
almost
impregnable
and
absolutely
beyond
the
hope
of
storming
the
forces
were
too
evenly
balanced
for
any
concerted
action
to
produce
a
desired
effect
the
possession
of
air
scouts
eliminated
any
question
of
a
surprise
in
other
words
the
conclusion
was
borne
in
upon
the
allies
with
full
force
that
much
as
the
german
plan
had
failed
at
marne
so
had
the
plan
failed
at
aisne
the
crossing
of
the
aisne
the
winning
of
the
heights
by
sir
douglas
haig
were
victories
not
only
that
but
they
were
full
of
that
glory
which
goes
with
successful
daring
yet
they
led
nowhere
the
plan
of
the
allies
must
be
abandoned
and
a
new
one
formed
this
decision
of
a
change
of
strategical
plan
then
closed
the
allies
frontal
attack
upon
the
position
of
the
central
powers
on
the
ridge
of
the
maise
and
marks
the
end
of
the
first
phase
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
chapter
xxii
bombardment
of
rheims
and
soissons
to
be
considered
almost
as
a
part
of
the
advance
upon
the
aisne
were
the
bombardments
of
soissons
and
of
rheims
the
former
being
a
part
of
the
first
phase
of
the
aisne
battles
the
second
belonging
to
the
second
phase
soissons
it
will
be
remembered
lies
at
the
western
end
of
the
high
bluffs
that
form
a
bank
to
the
river
aisne
for
over
fifty
miles
it
is
on
the
high
road
between
rheims
and
compiègne
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
aisne
and
consequently
returned
into
french
hands
on
september
no
sooner
did
the
french
armies
enter
the
little
town
however
than
soissons
dominated
by
the
twin
towers
of
its
ancient
cathedral
became
a
target
for
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
germans
whose
artillery
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
supplemented
that
morning
by
the
huge
guns
brought
on
from
maubeuge
by
the
magnificent
forced
marches
of
general
von
zwehl
by
noon
the
lower
half
of
that
once
lovely
city
was
in
flames
on
every
hand
walls
collapsed
as
though
they
had
been
made
of
pasteboard
women
and
children
were
buried
beneath
the
ruins
or
blown
to
pieces
as
they
fled
into
the
streets
one
of
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
was
damaged
and
there
was
not
a
corner
of
the
town
that
was
safe
from
fire
the
french
batteries
tried
to
cover
the
city
and
silence
the
batteries
opposing
them
on
the
north
front
of
the
river
but
the
odds
were
too
great
all
day
long
and
throughout
the
greater
part
of
every
night
for
the
first
three
days
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
september
and
the
bombardment
of
soissons
was
continual
and
in
addition
to
being
a
wreck
the
town
became
a
shambles
closely
allied
to
the
soissons
bombardment
and
occurring
simultaneously
with
the
battle
of
the
aisne
was
the
series
of
engagements
occurring
in
the
quarries
around
autreches
and
fought
by
advanced
bodies
in
front
of
the
right
wing
of
the
german
army
encamped
on
the
ridge
of
the
aisne
these
engagements
developed
the
illuminating
fact
that
during
times
of
peace
german
capital
had
been
invested
in
these
quarries
and
that
the
foresight
of
the
germans
had
led
them
to
fortify
these
quarries
so
that
they
were
veritable
fortresses
and
indeed
formed
a
continuation
of
that
line
of
defense
the
crowning
point
of
which
was
the
aisne
cliff
near
the
plateau
of
the
craonne
during
the
days
when
the
british
first
army
corps
under
sir
douglas
haig
was
performing
the
astounding
feat
of
crossing
the
aisne
and
holding
the
land
thus
gained
against
a
veritable
tempest
of
counterattack
these
stone
quarries
were
taken
and
lost
again
every
few
hours
the
french
infantry
of
general
manoury
army
far
less
exhausted
than
the
harassed
regiments
of
general
von
kluck
forces
found
little
difficulty
in
forcing
the
germans
back
from
autreches
but
no
sooner
were
they
well
established
than
the
roar
of
the
combined
guns
of
general
von
kluck
and
general
von
zwehl
would
make
the
position
untenable
and
under
cover
of
that
appalling
rain
of
death
the
german
infantry
would
creep
back
to
reoccupy
the
positions
from
which
they
had
been
ousted
by
the
bayonets
only
a
few
hours
before
it
was
the
german
tactics
of
machine
men
a
direful
and
cruel
battle
plan
to
the
opposing
forces
upon
the
day
that
the
advance
of
the
british
definitely
stopped
or
in
other
words
when
general
joffre
and
sir
john
french
realized
that
further
effort
against
the
defenses
of
the
germans
on
the
ridge
beyond
the
aisne
would
only
mean
loss
of
life
to
no
gainful
purpose
the
bombardment
of
rheims
began
the
old
city
had
suffered
severely
during
the
german
advance
upon
the
marne
still
it
had
not
been
pillaged
and
when
the
germans
retreated
across
the
aisne
the
old
city
held
much
of
its
glory
unimpaired
still
the
flawless
beauty
of
rheims
cathedral
stood
guard
over
the
ancient
city
then
on
september
the
shelling
of
the
city
began
and
a
bombardment
of
the
most
terrific
character
continued
for
ten
days
rheims
cathedral
which
the
french
declared
was
outside
the
zone
of
direct
fire
and
was
used
as
a
hospital
with
the
red
cross
flag
flying
and
which
the
germans
asserted
to
have
been
used
for
a
signal
station
and
to
have
been
surrounded
by
gun
stations
was
said
to
have
been
demolished
by
the
german
guns
this
act
created
a
sensation
throughout
the
world
for
rheims
cathedral
was
like
a
gem
from
paradise
regarded
by
most
art
lovers
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
buildings
in
the
world
every
civilized
country
was
shaken
with
grief
when
the
news
of
the
disaster
to
rheims
cathedral
was
published
it
must
be
admitted
that
military
necessity
knows
no
law
and
it
must
also
be
admitted
that
human
life
has
a
valuation
to
be
expressed
in
terms
far
higher
than
any
building
however
beautiful
in
an
inspired
article
written
by
major
general
von
ditfurth
in
the
hamburger
nachrichten
this
latter
point
is
clearly
brought
out
he
wrote
it
is
of
no
consequence
if
all
the
monuments
ever
created
all
the
pictures
ever
painted
and
all
the
buildings
ever
created
by
the
great
architects
of
the
world
were
destroyed
if
by
their
destruction
we
promote
germany
victory
over
her
enemies
the
commonest
ugliest
stone
placed
to
mark
the
burial
place
of
a
german
grenadier
is
a
more
glorious
and
perfect
monument
than
all
the
cathedrals
in
europe
put
together
let
neutral
peoples
and
our
enemies
cease
their
empty
chatter
which
is
no
better
than
the
twittering
of
birds
let
them
cease
their
talk
about
the
cathedral
at
rheims
and
about
all
the
churches
and
castles
of
france
which
have
shared
its
fate
these
things
do
not
interest
us
opinions
have
naturally
differed
concerning
von
ditfurth
appraisal
of
the
comparative
values
of
rheims
cathedral
and
the
tombstone
of
a
german
grenadier
but
even
the
champions
of
military
necessity
were
glad
to
learn
later
that
the
cathedral
still
stood
though
much
damaged
if
rheims
were
far
away
from
the
line
of
march
and
if
the
germans
had
deliberately
gone
thither
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
it
as
some
prejudiced
accounts
seem
to
state
then
there
would
not
be
room
for
two
opinions
wanton
vandalism
is
vandalism
largely
in
the
ratio
that
it
is
wanton
but
to
be
perfectly
impartial
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
second
phase
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
made
the
bombardment
of
rheims
a
military
necessity
to
make
this
clear
requires
a
setting
forth
of
the
new
strategical
plan
developed
by
field
marshal
von
heeringen
upon
the
collapse
of
the
plan
for
the
drive
on
paris
which
was
foiled
by
the
battles
of
the
marne
chapter
xxiii
second
phase
of
battle
of
the
aisne
the
second
phase
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
contained
two
factors
one
the
simplest
was
the
maintenance
of
that
line
of
defense
against
any
force
that
could
be
brought
up
against
it
by
the
allies
it
meant
the
ability
to
hold
strongly
fortified
positions
against
all
odds
the
history
of
the
trenches
that
winter
of
which
more
will
be
said
later
reveals
the
extent
to
which
the
germans
succeeded
aided
by
the
iron
craft
of
the
old
prussian
fighter
general
von
zwehl
the
other
factor
depended
on
the
vexed
question
of
means
of
communication
there
was
no
railway
linking
the
eastern
german
wing
to
the
western
german
wing
as
has
been
previously
remarked
all
supplies
and
munitions
had
to
come
in
a
roundabout
way
verdun
was
a
desired
goal
but
field
marshal
von
heeringen
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
if
the
crown
prince
effort
against
general
sarrail
had
failed
if
the
third
french
army
had
secured
heavy
reenforcement
and
if
it
had
been
left
unmolested
for
a
week
the
outer
ring
of
defenses
around
verdun
would
by
that
time
have
become
so
amazingly
strengthened
that
direct
or
frontal
attack
would
be
impossible
while
the
flanking
attack
had
failed
it
was
vain
therefore
at
the
present
time
to
hope
that
the
establishment
of
the
direct
communication
between
metz
and
verdun
might
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
invaders
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
direct
line
of
railway
running
through
rheims
rethel
mezières
to
the
great
war
depot
coblenz
on
the
rhine
a
branch
line
from
metz
through
luxemburg
thus
gave
communication
to
the
eastern
wing
all
the
links
of
this
were
in
german
hands
except
rheims
and
if
that
railroad
center
could
be
secured
the
importance
to
the
german
advance
would
be
enormous
under
such
circumstances
it
can
scarcely
be
held
that
rheims
was
not
necessarily
a
point
the
attack
of
which
was
due
to
military
necessity
the
formation
for
this
began
on
september
crossing
the
aisne
by
the
old
ford
of
a
powerful
army
under
the
direct
leadership
of
field
marshal
von
heeringen
debouched
upon
the
open
country
between
and
suippes
east
of
rheims
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
german
commander
in
chief
of
this
section
of
the
battle
line
intended
to
deliver
a
crushing
blow
by
which
might
be
regained
the
prestige
secured
at
charleroi
and
lost
again
at
the
marne
surprise
may
be
felt
that
so
important
a
railway
center
as
rheims
should
not
have
been
a
strongly
fortified
place
it
had
been
so
once
though
the
fortifications
were
but
instead
of
bringing
these
points
of
natural
defense
up
to
the
highest
degree
of
modern
efficiency
the
french
had
dismantled
them
entirely
so
as
to
make
rheims
with
its
glorious
cathedral
an
open
town
safe
from
bombardment
it
was
according
to
the
rules
of
war
safe
from
bombardment
but
only
in
the
event
of
its
not
being
defended
general
foch
did
not
dare
to
take
this
stand
he
knew
as
well
as
did
general
von
heeringen
the
strategic
value
of
rheims
as
railroad
center
and
accepted
the
issue
of
battle
in
the
falling
back
of
the
several
german
armies
from
the
marne
to
the
aisne
the
germans
had
kept
possession
of
the
chief
forts
of
the
district
around
rheims
no
strong
effort
had
been
made
to
dislodge
them
for
the
forward
movement
of
the
allies
had
been
directed
against
the
fortified
heights
of
the
aisne
facing
the
defense
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
armies
of
general
foch
and
langle
especially
the
latter
had
taken
no
part
in
the
first
phase
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
but
had
stubbornly
thrown
back
the
armies
of
the
duke
of
württemberg
which
had
combined
with
those
of
the
crown
prince
the
right
wing
of
this
large
conjoined
army
had
held
the
fort
sites
around
rheims
and
especially
they
had
made
full
use
of
the
chief
fort
on
the
wooded
heights
of
nogent
a
trifle
less
than
half
a
mile
from
the
cathedral
city
and
therefore
within
easy
destructive
shelling
range
the
heavy
artillery
was
planted
here
the
infantry
intrenched
around
it
and
strong
defense
trenches
were
established
along
the
river
suippe
that
runs
into
the
aisne
near
on
friday
september
the
first
movement
of
the
second
phase
was
begun
when
the
germans
launched
a
sharp
counterattack
on
the
french
center
this
was
the
first
german
offensive
movement
since
their
retreat
from
the
marne
and
it
was
powerful
and
well
handled
general
foch
fell
back
into
defensive
positions
but
had
much
ado
to
hold
his
own
he
evaded
giving
battle
around
rheims
and
took
up
a
position
at
souain
which
he
held
with
the
jaunty
obstinacy
he
had
displayed
so
often
in
the
retreat
through
northern
france
it
was
obvious
that
he
could
not
hold
out
long
but
by
clever
generalship
and
especially
by
an
extraordinarily
brilliant
use
of
the
cavalry
arm
he
held
off
the
army
for
that
day
that
night
strong
reenforcements
came
to
his
aid
and
on
september
the
balance
of
the
forces
was
more
nearly
equal
on
september
therefore
the
situation
of
the
armies
was
much
as
follows
the
germans
acting
under
the
general
command
of
field
marshal
von
heeringen
controlled
rheims
under
the
gunfire
of
their
heavy
artillery
from
two
points
the
heights
of
nogent
to
the
southeast
of
rheims
and
the
hill
of
brimont
a
little
over
half
a
mile
to
the
northeast
their
right
flank
was
covered
by
the
powerful
defenses
of
the
aisne
and
the
guns
of
the
craonne
plateau
their
left
flank
was
a
series
of
intrenchments
along
the
river
suippe
which
merged
into
the
second
line
of
defense
of
the
main
army
under
the
duke
of
württemberg
on
the
other
side
of
rheims
or
to
the
west
of
the
cathedral
city
the
allies
also
held
two
heights
one
at
pouillon
between
the
aisle
and
the
vesle
and
therefore
to
the
northwest
of
the
city
and
the
other
on
a
sharp
steep
known
as
the
mountain
of
rheims
near
verzenay
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
this
was
therefore
west
and
a
little
south
of
rheims
but
and
herein
lies
the
question
that
has
so
often
arisen
in
the
discussion
of
the
comparative
strength
of
the
two
armies
especially
without
the
british
batteries
the
french
lacked
heavy
artillery
they
had
no
such
howitzers
as
those
of
the
german
forces
thus
the
germans
could
shell
rheims
to
their
hearts
content
and
the
allies
could
not
silence
that
gunfire
from
their
own
fortified
positions
once
more
then
it
became
a
battle
between
infantry
and
artillery
between
men
and
machines
this
time
however
the
advance
was
not
favorable
to
the
germans
their
heavy
artillery
commanded
rheims
but
it
did
not
command
the
french
line
to
the
west
of
rheims
the
invaders
performed
prodigies
of
valor
again
and
again
they
hurled
themselves
against
the
french
line
but
general
foch
troops
were
well
supplied
with
that
terrible
engine
of
destruction
the
french
fieldpiece
known
as
the
an
extremely
powerful
gun
for
its
caliber
in
four
successive
night
attacks
on
september
the
heaviest
onset
was
made
supported
by
a
terrific
gunfire
directed
with
the
long
pointing
fingers
of
searchlights
the
german
infantry
invigorated
by
a
week
rest
rolled
up
in
tidal
waves
against
the
french
line
general
foch
had
known
how
to
post
his
defense
and
within
hours
he
had
made
the
line
between
pouillon
and
the
mountain
of
rheims
almost
as
strong
as
the
german
line
between
brimont
and
nogent
poor
rheims
lay
between
wide
open
to
the
eruption
of
destruction
that
belched
from
the
throats
of
the
german
howitzers
chapter
xxiv
end
of
the
battle
after
september
there
was
a
lull
in
the
fighting
at
rheims
and
as
afterward
appeared
this
was
due
mainly
to
another
change
of
plan
on
the
part
of
the
german
staff
but
it
was
no
part
of
general
foch
intentions
to
leave
the
bombardment
of
the
cathedral
unrevenged
he
had
indeed
caused
an
unparalleled
slaughter
on
the
night
of
september
as
has
been
stated
but
his
troops
were
avid
for
reprisal
and
the
french
strategist
knew
well
how
dangerous
it
is
to
allow
an
army
eager
for
action
and
revenge
to
eat
its
heart
out
vainly
he
was
too
wise
to
run
the
risk
of
a
countercharge
but
four
days
later
his
opportunity
came
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
the
full
at
dawn
on
september
a
detachment
of
germans
including
all
that
remained
of
the
famous
prussian
guards
corps
that
same
body
that
had
fought
so
marvelously
on
many
occasions
and
which
had
suffered
the
most
cruelly
in
the
affair
of
the
marshes
of
gond
made
a
sortie
from
the
base
line
at
nogent
to
destroy
the
railway
line
between
rheims
and
verdun
this
line
was
indeed
the
principal
link
of
communication
to
that
fortress
that
protruded
its
bristling
salient
into
the
heart
of
the
german
position
a
french
aviator
who
had
climbed
into
his
machine
when
it
was
yet
dark
in
order
to
do
a
little
daybreak
scouting
before
the
light
should
be
sufficiently
bright
to
make
him
an
easy
target
saw
this
movement
and
reported
it
immediately
to
general
foch
that
commander
who
knew
how
to
use
cavalry
ordered
a
regiment
at
the
gallop
to
occupy
the
village
of
auberive
on
the
suippe
and
there
harry
the
advancing
column
sufficiently
to
give
him
time
to
bring
up
the
light
artillery
and
to
bring
into
action
a
large
body
of
infantry
encamped
at
jouchery
five
miles
away
before
six
the
cavalry
were
in
auberive
the
men
worked
like
fiends
the
streets
were
rapidly
barricaded
machine
guns
hoisted
to
roofs
and
other
points
where
they
might
command
a
wide
sweep
of
fire
then
the
cavalry
rode
forward
to
meet
the
advancing
column
not
knowing
what
might
be
in
front
of
him
the
german
commander
halted
awaiting
reports
from
his
air
scouts
the
halt
was
but
of
an
hour
but
that
was
of
vast
importance
the
scouts
reported
only
a
regiment
of
cavalry
ahead
but
a
powerful
detachment
of
french
artillery
on
the
road
from
jouchery
the
german
leader
detached
of
the
death
head
hussars
his
crack
cavalry
to
cut
off
or
at
all
events
to
delay
the
french
guns
he
was
aware
that
the
artillery
would
have
no
anticipation
of
this
and
in
the
surprise
the
guns
might
be
captured
meantime
he
hurried
his
advance
to
auberive
captured
the
village
though
after
another
hour
delay
caused
by
the
resistance
of
the
cavalry
who
retreated
to
hilaire
meantime
at
hilaire
the
surprise
charge
of
the
death
head
hussars
was
launched
it
was
scarcely
a
question
of
minutes
it
was
rather
a
matter
of
seconds
but
the
french
artillery
knew
their
light
fieldpieces
as
thoroughly
as
the
germans
were
masters
of
the
heavy
guns
in
less
than
two
minutes
the
artillery
teams
were
unharnessed
the
guns
were
in
position
and
the
gunners
took
their
places
when
the
hussars
were
so
near
the
voices
of
their
leaders
could
be
heard
thirty
seconds
earlier
and
the
hussars
would
have
been
in
among
the
guns
and
made
a
notable
capture
there
was
just
time
enough
for
a
man
to
breathe
twice
when
the
order
came
to
fire
the
hussars
were
at
less
than
a
hundred
yards
range
as
the
shrapnel
burst
the
front
squadrons
seemed
to
stumble
and
fall
the
ranks
were
so
near
that
the
change
from
living
human
beings
into
mangled
pieces
of
flesh
and
rags
could
clearly
be
seen
more
than
one
veteran
gunner
felt
squeamish
at
the
sight
but
the
rear
squadrons
though
their
horses
hoofs
were
squelching
in
the
blood
of
their
comrades
of
a
moment
before
never
blenched
or
faltered
but
swept
on
at
a
thundering
gallop
again
the
guns
spoke
and
again
that
was
all
amid
the
vines
here
and
there
a
writhing
figure
could
be
seen
or
a
wounded
horse
endeavoring
to
rise
and
here
and
there
a
straggler
striving
to
escape
it
was
level
open
country
twice
again
the
guns
roared
five
rounds
in
all
and
all
movement
ceased
the
engagement
had
lasted
less
than
five
minutes
and
of
those
two
thousand
splendid
horsemen
not
one
escaped
the
french
artillerists
picked
up
the
wounded
and
sent
them
back
to
rheims
to
receive
nursing
and
care
and
then
hurried
on
to
the
action
whither
they
were
bound
when
surprised
by
the
hussars
the
infantry
of
the
germans
and
of
the
french
were
now
coming
to
hand
grips
a
battalion
of
zouaves
was
creeping
round
to
attack
the
advancing
column
in
the
rear
the
german
commander
at
nogent
learned
from
his
air
scouts
what
was
happening
he
saw
the
peril
of
the
advancing
column
that
it
was
almost
surrounded
and
he
threw
further
columns
into
the
fray
to
cover
the
retreat
the
sortie
on
the
railway
had
now
become
impossible
general
foch
had
moved
too
quickly
but
even
so
the
peril
was
great
for
the
german
force
was
almost
cut
off
it
meant
the
loss
of
men
and
artillery
or
it
meant
the
sacrifice
of
some
one
corps
to
cover
the
retreat
the
latter
course
was
chosen
three
thousand
of
the
guards
corps
the
flower
of
the
prussian
army
were
sent
like
a
catapult
at
the
gap
in
the
french
line
immediately
in
front
of
rheims
five
times
they
charged
and
with
such
heroic
daring
and
such
penetrative
energy
that
general
foch
did
not
dare
break
from
his
position
as
they
came
up
for
the
fifth
assault
a
wild
cheer
of
admiration
broke
out
along
the
french
line
but
the
rifles
spoke
steadily
none
the
less
for
that
after
the
fifth
assault
barely
a
hundred
men
were
left
nearly
all
wounded
they
reversed
rifles
a
sign
of
surrender
and
in
all
honor
they
were
received
by
general
foch
who
conducted
them
to
the
hospital
in
the
rear
they
lived
up
to
the
full
the
most
heroic
traditions
of
the
old
prussian
corps
and
they
saved
that
whole
german
force
from
destruction
still
with
the
annihilation
of
the
death
head
hussars
and
the
remainder
of
the
prussian
guards
corps
on
the
same
day
the
forces
under
general
foch
felt
that
in
part
rheims
had
been
avenged
the
other
section
of
this
second
phase
of
the
aisne
consisted
of
the
trench
warfare
which
solidified
from
september
to
october
under
conditions
of
extreme
difficulty
and
more
than
extreme
discomfort
it
was
practically
the
establishment
of
a
trench
campaign
that
lasted
all
winter
and
revived
the
fortress
warfare
applying
it
under
modern
conditions
to
field
fortifications
the
french
during
that
winter
on
the
aisne
never
quite
succeeded
in
rivaling
the
mechanical
precision
of
the
german
movements
the
germans
on
the
other
hand
never
showed
themselves
to
possess
the
emotional
fervor
of
the
french
with
the
bayonet
in
many
places
german
and
allies
trenches
almost
touched
each
other
the
first
two
weeks
at
the
aisne
were
one
continual
downpour
and
the
foundation
of
that
ground
is
chalk
on
the
sides
of
the
plateau
of
craonne
after
two
weeks
rain
the
chalky
mud
seemed
bottomless
it
filled
the
ears
and
eyes
and
throats
of
our
men
wrote
john
buchan
it
plastered
their
clothing
and
mingled
generously
with
their
diet
their
grandfathers
who
had
been
at
sebastopol
could
have
told
them
something
about
mud
but
even
after
india
and
south
africa
the
mire
of
the
aisne
seemed
a
grievous
affliction
the
fighting
was
constant
the
nervous
strain
exhausting
and
the
cold
and
wet
were
even
harder
to
bear
there
had
as
yet
been
no
time
to
build
trenches
with
all
conveniences
such
as
the
germans
possessed
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
the
trenches
of
the
allies
were
a
chilled
inferno
of
woe
a
stretch
of
waste
ground
lay
between
the
trenches
and
often
for
days
at
a
time
the
fire
was
too
heavy
to
rescue
the
wounded
or
bring
in
the
dead
the
men
in
the
trenches
on
either
side
were
compelled
to
hear
the
groans
of
the
wounded
lying
in
the
open
day
after
day
until
exhaustion
cold
and
pain
brought
them
a
merciful
release
in
letters
more
than
one
soldier
declared
that
the
hardest
thing
to
bear
was
to
hear
a
fellow
comrade
shrieking
or
groaning
in
agony
a
few
steps
away
for
hours
even
days
at
a
time
and
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
to
help
the
stench
from
the
unburied
bodies
was
so
great
that
officially
all
the
tobacco
for
the
whole
battle
front
was
commandeered
and
sent
to
the
trenches
under
the
plateau
of
craonne
and
on
the
hill
to
the
westward
where
the
british
first
army
corps
was
placed
such
for
the
two
weeks
between
september
and
october
was
the
trench
warfare
during
the
second
phase
of
the
battle
of
the
aisne
a
condition
never
after
repeated
in
the
war
for
such
a
feat
as
the
crossing
of
the
aisne
could
scarcely
be
duplicated
it
was
gallant
it
was
magnificent
and
it
was
costly
the
british
casualty
list
for
september
to
october
being
killed
wounded
and
missing
officers
and
men
but
it
was
useless
and
only
served
to
give
the
allies
a
temporary
base
whereby
general
foch
was
successful
in
checking
the
german
attempt
to
capture
the
railway
it
was
a
victory
of
bravery
but
not
a
victory
of
result
during
all
these
operations
the
belgian
army
now
at
antwerp
had
harassed
the
german
troops
by
frequent
sorties
the
capture
of
the
city
was
at
once
undertaken
by
the
german
staff
following
the
stalemate
created
by
the
operations
at
the
aisne
chapter
xxv
the
race
to
the
sea
the
germans
having
failed
in
their
first
enveloping
movement
attempted
a
second
after
the
battle
of
the
marne
they
tried
to
repeat
their
maneuver
of
august
endeavoring
to
overwhelm
the
french
left
while
the
french
on
their
side
tried
to
overwhelm
the
german
right
each
of
these
armies
by
a
converging
movement
gradually
drew
its
forces
toward
the
west
no
sooner
did
the
germans
bring
up
a
new
corps
on
their
right
than
the
french
brought
up
another
on
their
left
thus
the
front
of
the
battle
ascended
more
and
more
to
the
west
and
north
until
arriving
at
the
sea
it
could
go
no
farther
this
is
what
has
been
called
by
french
military
critics
the
race
to
the
sea
in
this
race
to
the
sea
the
germans
had
a
great
advantage
over
the
french
a
glance
at
the
map
is
enough
to
make
it
understood
the
concave
form
of
the
german
front
made
the
lines
of
transportation
shorter
they
were
within
the
interior
of
the
angle
while
the
french
were
at
the
exterior
on
the
german
side
this
movement
drew
into
the
line
more
than
eighteen
army
corps
or
twelve
active
corps
six
reserve
corps
and
four
cavalry
corps
on
the
french
side
it
resulted
in
the
posting
of
the
army
of
castelnau
on
the
left
of
manoury
army
in
the
deployment
of
the
army
of
general
de
to
the
left
of
the
army
of
castelnau
in
the
transference
of
the
british
army
to
the
left
of
the
army
of
in
the
relegation
of
the
army
of
urbal
to
the
left
of
the
british
army
the
army
of
urbal
being
later
flanked
by
the
belgian
army
which
came
out
of
antwerp
in
order
to
accomplish
this
new
and
extended
disposition
of
forces
the
french
general
staff
was
compelled
to
reduce
to
their
extreme
limits
the
effective
strengths
of
the
armies
of
the
east
and
of
the
oise
and
as
a
result
to
make
the
maximum
use
of
the
means
of
transport
in
this
it
succeeded
when
the
great
battle
of
flanders
was
waged
toward
the
end
of
october
the
germans
trying
to
turn
the
french
left
and
to
pierce
it
found
themselves
facing
considerable
french
forces
which
allied
with
the
british
and
belgian
armies
completely
barred
the
passage
against
them
from
the
of
september
it
was
clear
that
the
germans
were
making
a
great
effort
to
try
and
overwhelm
the
french
left
general
joffre
parried
the
attack
reenforcing
at
first
the
army
of
manoury
by
an
army
corps
then
transferring
to
the
left
of
the
army
of
manoury
the
entire
army
of
castelnau
that
was
in
lorraine
a
corps
of
cavalry
and
four
territorial
divisions
commanded
by
general
brugère
received
the
order
to
establish
itself
on
both
banks
of
the
somme
and
protect
the
detraining
of
the
army
of
castelnau
from
september
to
september
all
the
french
forces
that
had
newly
arrived
were
engaged
in
the
region
they
succeeded
in
withstanding
not
without
difficulty
the
german
attack
but
they
could
not
advance
the
germans
determinedly
and
unweariedly
continued
to
mass
new
forces
on
their
right
on
the
left
of
the
army
of
castelnau
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
establish
a
new
army
it
was
established
on
september
under
the
command
of
general
from
the
first
days
of
october
this
army
waged
violent
conflicts
in
the
region
of
arras
and
of
lens
it
found
facing
it
two
german
cavalry
corps
the
guard
four
active
army
corps
and
two
reserve
corps
general
joffre
continued
without
intermission
to
send
new
forces
to
the
left
on
october
he
called
on
general
foch
in
the
north
and
charged
him
with
the
duty
of
coordinating
the
action
of
all
the
armies
in
that
region
those
of
de
castelnau
and
the
territorial
divisions
at
the
beginning
of
october
the
british
army
which
was
posted
on
the
aisne
was
transferred
to
the
left
of
the
french
armies
and
replaced
by
the
armies
of
manoury
and
the
belgian
army
issuing
from
antwerp
on
october
effected
its
retreat
covered
by
the
british
naval
forces
and
french
marines
it
took
its
place
on
the
yser
canal
between
nieuport
and
dixmude
the
germans
continuing
their
efforts
to
turn
the
french
left
it
was
found
necessary
again
to
strengthen
that
left
considerably
and
new
french
army
corps
were
transferred
to
flanders
and
belgium
it
was
a
new
french
army
that
was
established
and
the
command
of
it
was
intrusted
to
general
it
consisted
at
first
of
two
divisions
of
territorials
and
four
divisions
of
cavalry
of
the
corps
of
general
de
mitry
along
with
a
brigade
of
naval
fusiliers
but
from
october
to
november
it
received
considerable
reenforcements
during
the
second
week
in
november
the
german
attack
revealing
its
purpose
more
clearly
general
joffre
sent
four
more
battalions
of
chasseurs
and
four
more
brigades
of
infantry
the
reenforcements
sent
to
the
french
army
of
the
north
totaled
as
a
result
five
army
corps
a
division
of
cavalry
a
territorial

sixteen
cavalry
regiments
and
more
than
sixty
pieces

than
two
weeks

historic
city
one
of
the
most
important
trade
centers
of
the
world
and
one
of
the
strongest
fortresses
in
europe
was
forced
to
capitulate
though
it
had
always
been
believed
to
be
impregnable
during
the
latter
part
of
september
the
forces
of
the
belligerents
were
driving
northward
in
that
memorable
race
for
the
channel
in
which
both
sides
had
the

object
each

trying
to
be
the
first
to
turn

at
the

time
the
german
forces
then
in
the
vicinity
of
brussels
under
the
command
of
general
van
beseler
pushed
toward
antwerp
on
which
the
belgian
army
had
fallen
back
to
make
its
last
stand
this
move
was
necessary
in

antwerp
was
considered
one
of
the
most
formidable
strongholds
in
the
world
the
elaborate
defenses
of
antwerp
evolved
from
the
original
fortifications
of
thirty
years
ago
through
continual
additions
the
location
of
the
city
offers
very
many
natural

entire
district
these
circulars
contained
a
proclamation
to
the
belgian
soldiers
advising
them
to
stop
fighting
for
england
and
russia
and
to
return
home
to
their
wives
and
children
as
germany
was
ready
to
help
and
befriend
them
the
belgian
government
which
had
established
itself
in
antwerp
after
the
occupation
of
brussels
decided
to
leave
the
city
as
soon
as
possible
two
small
steamers
were
ordered
to
be
held
in
readiness
the
foreign
legations
also
decided
to
go
with
the
government
throughout
this
day
a
steady
fire
was
kept
up
on
the
nearest
outer
forts
but
the
belgian
soldiers
contested
every
inch
of
ground
against
the
german
advance
this
fighting
continued
throughout
the
entire
day
following
during
which
two
of
the
minor
outer
forts
were
silenced
rapid
progress
by
the
germans
was
very
difficult
owing
to
the
peculiar
conformation
of
the
course
of
the
river
scheldt
at
the
point
of
attack
this
made
especially
difficult
the
laying
of
concrete
foundations
for
the
heavy
guns
the
first
detachment
of
british
troops
numbering
about
marines
reached
antwerp
on
october
this
buoyed
up
the
spirits
of
the
belgian
soldiers
and
redoubled
their
efforts
under
cover
of
the
continuous
fire
of
their
guns
the
germans
made
determined
efforts
to
cross
the
river
nethe
at
waelhem
desperate
fighting
which
lasted
all
night
and
until
early
in
the
morning
of
october
took
place
this
attempt
however
failed
later
in
the
day
the
germans
succeeded
in
putting
a
pontoon
bridge
in
place
troops
in
solid
masses
hurried
across
but
as
they
reached
the
other
side
some
shots
from
the
belgian
guns
blew
the
pontoon
bridge
to
pieces
killing
many
throughout
the
night
of
october
and
the
day
and
night
of
october
the
battle
raged
about
lierre
with
savage
ferocity
the
british
marines
had
by
this
time
relieved
the
belgians
the
german
fire
however
compelled
the
defenders
to
draw
back
a
considerable
distance
at
four
in
the
morning
of
october
the
germans
succeeded
in
crossing
the
river
in
force
and
now
the
defenders
were
obliged
to
give
way
as
the
outer
forts
had
ceased
to
afford
them
any
protection
late
in
the
afternoon
the
members
of
the
belgian
cabinet
and
their
official
families
went
aboard
one
steamer
while
the
french
and
british
legations
boarded
another
both
sailing
early
on
october
the
belgian
troops
had
begun
to
withdraw
the
evening
before
all
the
defending
forces
now
hastened
their
retreat
the
actual
evacuation
had
indeed
begun
time
was
taken
however
to
put
out
of
commission
some
thirty
steamships
lying
at
their
docks
and
to
set
afire
all
the
large
oil
tanks
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
scheldt
the
streets
in
antwerp
presented
scenes
of
almost
indescribable
confusion
even
before
the
bombardment
had
been
long
in
operation
almost
the
entire
civil
population
became
hither
and
thither
wherever
the
crowd
drifted
explosions
obstructed
their
paths
fronts
of
buildings
bent
over
and
fell
into
the
streets
in
many
cases
crushing
their
occupants
although
the
burgomaster
had
issued
a
proclamation
advising
the
people
to
remain
calm
indoors
if
possible
nothing
could
stop
the
stampede
the
defending
troops
withdrawing
through
the
city
from
the
firing
line
destroyed
everything
that
might
possibly
be
of
use
to
the
enemy
the
suburbs
of
antwerp
seemed
to
be
ablaze
in
every
direction
the
village
of
waerloos
had
been
burning
for
some
days
contich
duffel
and
lierre
also
and
have
linth
and
vieux
dieu
had
been
destroyed
by
shell
fire
mortsel
was
practically
obliterated
by
the
belgians
clearing
the
range
for
the
guns
of
the
inner
forts
in
the
preparation
for
defense
the
belgians
destroyed
upward
of
ten
thousand
buildings
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
the
exodus
of
the
civil
population
began
in
earnest
on
october
some
of
the
streets
in
the
heart
of
the
city
were
choked
with
people
while
other
streets
in
the
same
vicinity
were
dead
and
deserted
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
was
well
screened
from
the
german
guns
but
their
retreat
to
the
west
had
been
cut
off
to
a
great
extent
and
holland
was
now
the
only
refuge
for
many
the
germans
did
not
use
their
heaviest
guns
and
shells
in
bombarding
the
city
during
this
terrible
time
in
utter
darkness
and
confusion
crowds
amounting
to
many
thousands
men
and
women
with
babies
and
children
of
all
ages
streamed
through
the
streets
that
led
to
the
quays
or
to
the
turnpike
to
holland
all
sorts
of
vehicles
from
dogcarts
to
motor
trucks
the
former
drawn
by
dogs
men
and
horses
carried
the
belongings
of
the
fugitives
that
could
not
be
carried
away
in
person
the
bombardment
continued
with
varying
severity
throughout
october
as
the
germans
drew
nearer
to
the
city
all
the
inner
forts
on
the
south
and
east
sides
of
the
circle
took
part
in
replying
to
the
cannonade
some
of
these
forts
notably
two
three
four
and
five
were
badly
battered
by
afternoon
the
city
seemed
deserted
nothing
but
débris
of
fallen
buildings
and
wreckage
met
the
eyes
and
a
small
remnant
of
the
population
was
still
struggling
for
escape
along
all
the
wayside
immense
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
gathered
the
railway
stations
were
choked
with
struggling
humanity
their
condition
was
pitiable
these
scenes
continued
all
day
and
throughout
the
entire
night
on
the
morning
of
october
the
struggle
to
get
away
continued
long
lines
formed
on
the
quay
where
it
had
been
reported
that
two
boats
would
leave
for
ostend
by
eleven
and
all
those
that
could
pay
struggled
to
get
their
passage
booked
there
were
between
and
people
on
the
quays
every
one
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
that
safety
was
in
sight
at
last
but
the
boats
failed
to
sail
and
a
murmur
of
disappointment
rose
from
this
vast
multitude
of
unfortunates
however
there
were
other
means
of
escape
available
such
as
tugboats
plying
between
flushing
rotterdam
and
other
adjacent
points
in
holland
these
tugs
had
no
great
accommodations
for
passengers
and
comparatively
few
people
escaped
by
this
means
no
trains
were
scheduled
to
run
and
in
despair
the
crowds
started
to
cross
the
bridge
and
make
for
the
road
to
the
dutch
frontier
altogether
from
to
of
the
population
of
the
city
escaped
by
one
means
or
another
during
a
continuous
bombardment
of
twelve
hours
the
cathedral
stood
unharmed
the
southern
part
of
antwerp
was
a
desolate
waste
of
ruins
in
some
streets
all
the
homes
were
ablaze
the
flames
leaping
hither
and
thither
with
the
wind
the
great
oil
tanks
burning
fiercely
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
scheldt
were
fired
upon
by
some
shots
to
check
the
blaze
a
huge
black
volume
of
thick
smoke
now
rising
from
the
flames
to
add
to
the
difficulties
and
confusion
the
water
supply
had
been
cut
off
during
the
early
stages
of
the
bombardment
through
the
destruction
of
the
waterworks
which
were
located
in
one
of
the
suburbs
to
the
south
and
the
consequences
threatened
to
become
alarming
everywhere
fires
were
burning
this
was
the
tragic
scene
when
the
german
army
entered
the
conquered
city
of
antwerp
on
october
it
is
probable
that
a
large
part
of
the
city
would
have
been
burned
if
the
germans
had
not
entered
in
time
to
check
the
conflagration
without
loss
of
time
forces
were
put
to
work
fighting
the
fires
and
clearing
the
streets
propping
up
unsafe
buildings
and
making
order
out
of
chaos
with
the
usual
teuton
efficiency
as
soon
as
the
bombardment
had
ceased
proclamations
were
pasted
on
walls
and
houses
throughout
the
city
urging
everyone
to
surrender
any
arms
in
their
possession
and
begging
for
a
calm
demeanor
when
the
german
troops
pass
through
the
streets
about
noon
on
october
a
patrol
of
police
escorted
the
burgomaster
to
the
gate
of
the
city
to
receive
the
german
forces
when
they
entered
order
was
restored
without
delay
soldiers
were
immediately
detached
from
their
special
command
and
formed
into
gangs
under
competent
foremen
and
all
put
to
work
at
once
each
according
to
his
trade
fitness
or
adaptability
the
forts
that
had
been
dismantled
were
hastily
patched
up
and
new
guns
mounted
for
emergency
use
on
october
field
marshal
van
der
goltz
the
governor
general
of
belgium
came
from
brussels
and
made
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
double
girdle
of
forts
upon
examination
it
was
found
that
the
actual
damage
done
to
the
city
by
the
bombardment
was
comparatively
slight
during
the
last
days
of
antwerp
reign
of
terror
fully
fugitives
sought
shelter
in
about
miles
northward
across
the
dutch
frontier
most
of
these
were
in
a
condition
almost
indescribable
ragged
shoeless
and
bespattered
and
hungry
few
had
money
valuables
or
other
resources
all
they
owned
they
carried
on
their
backs
or
in
bundles
the
little
dutch
town
of
with
but
inhabitants
was
swamped
but
the
hollanders
did
their
best
to
meet
this
terrible
pressure
and
its
citizens
went
without
bread
themselves
to
feed
the
refugees
slowly
some
sort
of
order
was
organized
out
of
the
chaos
and
when
the
dutch
government
was
able
to
establish
refugee
camps
under
military
supervision
the
worst
was
over
a
majority
of
this
vast
army
was
by
degrees
distributed
in
the
surrounding
territory
where
tent
accommodations
had
been
completed
the
good
hollanders
provided
for
the
children
with
especial
care
and
sympathy
they
supplied
milk
for
the
babies
and
children
generally
devoted
priests
comforted
many
but
military
organization
prevailed
over
all
among
the
thousands
of
these
poor
refugees
that
crossed
the
frontier
at
maastricht
and
besieged
the
doors
of
the
belgian
consul
there
was
no
railing
or
declaiming
against
the
horror
of
their
situation
the
pathos
of
lonely
staring
apathetic
endurance
was
tragic
beyond
expression

a
large
part
of

forces
with
some
of

were
forced
across
the

where
they
were

interned
while
the
remnants

retreated
toward

had
fallen
into
their
hands
by
october
after
the
english
and
belgian
troops
had
been
taken
away
by
an
english
fleet
the
belgians
were
transported
to
france
where
they
were
while
the
english
marines
were
sent
back
to
england
in
the
meantime
the
germans
were
drawing
on
reenforcements
from
the
vosges
and
the
champagne
districts
and
every
day
their
numbers
increased
west
flanders
was
swarming
with
german
cavalry
and
about
this
time
they
were
as
far
west
as
hazebrouck
and
cassel
and
only
miles
distant
from

by

supported
by

for
days
this

under
the
british

had
shelled
the
coast
defenses
under
general
von
beseler
command
as
the
naval
guns
had
a
far
better
range
than
general
von

it
was
an
easy
matter
to
hold
the

at

and
even
six
miles
inland
without
subjecting
any
of
the

to

while
the

on
the

it
is
estimated
that
upward
of
thirty
army
corps
covered
the
german

throughout
the
balance
of
october
and
well
into
november
a
great
many
different

and
some
of
the
heaviest
fighting
of
this
period
took
place
all
along

all
along

the

on
the
north
of

in
the

a
fiercely
contested
action
took
place
near

which
village
the
germans
captured
in
the
morning
the
german

corps
pressed
on
to

where
they
met
with
stout
resistance
from
the
forces
on
october
the
germans
attacked
from
the
la
bassée
region
and
gained
several
small
villages
both
allies
and
germans
suffered
immense
lasses
much
of
the
slaughter
was
due
to
the
magazine
fire
and
the
intermittent
shrapnel
explosions
from
bath
sides
the
mast
savage
fighting
was
kept
up
all
along
the
line
but
no
advantage
accrued
ta
either
side
until
friday
october
when
the
germans
succeeded
in
crossing
the
yser
at
george
and
forcing
their
way
two
miles
to
ramscapelle
retaken
on

this
was
accomplished
by

von
troops
opposing
the
mixed
troops
of
the
belgian
and
french
on
that
night
fourteen
separate
attacks
were
made
by
the
germans
on
dixmude
and
they
were
repulsed
each
time
on
october
about
german
troops
crossed
the
canal
at
schoorbakke
and
next
day
there
were
more
to
come
so
for
the
moment
it
looked
as
though
the
allied
line
on
the
yser
had
been
broken
the
struggle
at
this
point
continued
until
october
during
which
time
the
allies
contested
every
inch
of
ground
the
kaiser
was
with
the
duke
of
württemberg
on
this
day
expecting
every
moment
that
his
great
design
to
break
through
the
lines
and
drive
his
forces
to
dunkirk
and
calais
would
be
accomplished
at
the
crisis
the
belgians
broke
dawn
the
dykes
and
flooded
the
country
for
miles
around
heavy
rains
during
the
last
weeks
had
swelled
the
yser
the
belgians
had
dammed
the
lower
reaches
of
the
canal
the
yser
lipped
over
its
brim
and
spread
lagoons
over
the
flat
meadows
soon
the
german
forces
on
the
west
bank
were
floundering
in
a
foot
of
water
while
their
guns
were
waterlogged
and
deep
in
mud
the
germans
did
not
abandon
their
efforts
the
kaiser
called
for
volunteers
to
carry
ramscapelle
two
württemberg
brigades
responded
and
gained
the
place
but
at
terrible
loss
on
the
of
october
again
the
württembergers
advanced
to
the
attack
they
waded
through
sloppy
fields
from
the
bridgeheads
at
george
and
schoorbakke
and
by
means
of
table
taps
boards
planks
and
other
devices
crossed
the
deeper
dykes
so
furious
was
the
attack
pressed
home
that
they
won
the
railway
line
and
held
their
ground
they
were
to
do
some
severe
fighting
however
for
next
day
and
african
mixed
troops
fought
fiercely
to
drive
the
germans
back
but
failed
seeing
their
success
in
partially
flooding
the
battle
field
the
belgians
made
more
breaches
in
the
dams
and
opening
the
sluices
in
the
canal
threw
a
flood
of
water
greater
still
over
the
area
occupied
by
the
germans
in
seething
brown
waves
the
water
rose
up
to
the
high
ground
at
the
railway
near
ramscapelle
the
germans
were
caught
in
this
tide
and
scores
of
them
were
drowned
many
escaped
some
struggled
to
land
on
the
allies
front
and
were
made
prisoners

held
by

until

general
rawlinson
was
opposed
by
superior
forces
and
was
unable
to
prevent
the
germans
from
getting
large
reenforcements
with
four
divisions
holding
a
much
wider
front
than
their
size
justified
he
faced
a
rather
awkward
situation
as
the
enemy
was
massed
from
the
lys
the
shattered
belgian
army
and
the
weary
french
troops
advanced
to
check
the
germans
but
in
vain
sir

haig
with

on
october
while
the
belgian
army
intrenched
along
the
yser
canal
general
haig
failed
owing
to
bad
roads
october
brought
the
most
severe
attack
made
on
the
first
corps
at
ypres
in
the
checking
of
which
the
worcestershire
regiment
did
good
work
this
day
marked
the
most
critical
period
in
the
battle
which
resulted
in
the
recapture
of
the
village
of
gheluvelt
south
of
dixmude
is
one
of
the
most
historic
and
quaintly
attractive
cities
of
belgium
ypres
it
is
situated
on
a
tributary
of
the
yser
called
the
yperlee
and
a
railway
runs
through
it
from
roulers
to
the
main
ower
line
at
hazebrouck
and
a
very
important
canal
runs
from
the
yser
in
the
north
to
the
lys
at
comines
the
allied
lines
were
held
by
the
british
first
and
third
corps
and
several
cavalry
divisions
at
this
point
all
under
the
chief
command
of
general
haig
while
the
bavarian
crown
prince
directed
the
movements
of
the
german
forces
on
october
the
allied
line
stretched
a
few
miles
to
the
northeast
of
ypres
from
bixschoote
to
the
crossroads
a
mile
and
a
half
northwest
of
zonnebeke
the
cavalry
only
were
kept
busy
during
this
day
while
the
other
forces
were
making
elaborate
preparations
for
the
main
drive
the
great
attack
was
delivered
october
against
the
point
of
the
salient
between
zonnebeke
and
besselaere
the
allied
line
on
the
left
was
so
much
exposed
that
the
brigade
was
enfiladed
by
the
germans
at
the
very
beginning
and
in
the
center
the
germans
pierced
the
line
held
by
the
royal
scots
fusiliers
with
the
yorkshires
on
the
extreme
right
the
fierce
assaults
from
both
sides
ended
in
a
draw
for
this
day
on
october
the
fighting
was
most
severe
all
day
but
later
in
the
day
the
most
violent
assault
of
all
was
made
by
the
germans
upon
the
first
brigade
on
the
left
there
the
trenches
were
held
by
the
camerons
north
of
pilkem
on
the
langemarck
bixschoote
road
here
the
germans
broke
the
line
and
succeeded
in
capturing
part
of
the
camerons
the
famous
red
tartans
further
south
the
royal
scots
fusiliers
were
obliged
to
give
way
the
germans
pressed
hard
in
the
vicinity
of
hollebeke
which
point
opened
a
clear
road
to
ypres
but
here
the
allied
forces
stood
their
ground
still
farther
south
the
essex
regiment
and
the
lancashire
fusiliers
fought
savagely
but
were
driven
back
upon
armentierre
when
night
fell
illustration
battle
front
in
flanders
early
friday
morning
october
the
allies
made
a
desperate
assault
upon
the
trenches
lost
by
the
camerons
on
the
previous
day
the
fighting
culminated
in
a
savage
bayonet
attack
which
resulted
in
the
recapture
of
these
trenches
by
the
british
composed
of
the
king
royal
rifles
the
royal
west
surrey
regiment
and
the
northamptons
on
october
the
germans
advanced
upon
the
allied
extreme
left
but
were
successfully
repulsed
between
zonnebeke
and
poelcapelle
later
in
the
day
the
germans
renewed
their
attack
and
compelled
the
allied
troops
to
retire
some
distance
the
advance
on
the
allied
left
was
continued
on
sunday
october
repeatedly
the
germans
succeeded
in
piercing
the
allied
lines
but
at
one
time
even
though
they
had
broken
through
a
momentary
lack
of
reserves
compelled
them
to
retreat
to
avoid
capture
a
savage
enveloping
attack
was
made
during
the
night
north
of
zandvoorde
where
again
the
germans
broke
through
the
allied
lines
but
were
unable
to
maintain
their
advantage
through
failure
of
reenforcements
to
come
up
in
time
the
leicester
brigade
were
shelled
out
of
their
trenches
and
were
obliged
to
fall
back
to
the
south
of
the
river
lys
during
the
following
three
days
october
artillery
fire
was
resorted
to
and
desultory
fighting
and
skirmishes
along
the
entire
line
resulted
in
no
noteworthy
advantage
to
either
belligerent
thursday
october
opened
with
clear
and
bracing
weather
which
promised
to
continue
throughout
the
day
the
german
attack
which
had
been
preparing
for
the
past
three
days
now
broke
like
an
irresistible
wave
upon
the
salient
of
the
gheluvelt
crossroads
where
the
british
first
corps
was
stationed
the
first
division
was
driven
back
from
its
trenches
and
after
that
the
line
swayed
forward
and
backward
for
hours
but
by
two
in
the
afternoon
the
position
remained
unchanged
with
the
coming
of
the
dawn
on
october
the
fighting
was
resumed
with
even
more
savage
determination
on
both
sides
the
hottest
engagement
centered
about
the
ridge
of
zandvoorde
german
artillery
fire
cleared
the
allied
trenches
burying
many
of
the
british
soldiers
alive
under
mountains
of
earth
and
débris
this
forced
the
line
to
retreat
a
full
mile
to
klein
zillebeke
to
the
north
the
kaiser
witnessed
this
engagement
and
by
his
presence
cheered
the
german
soldiers
on
to
the
most
desperate
fighting
on
the
following
day
october
the
crisis
came
the
fighting
began
along
the
road
early
in
the
morning
and
advanced
with
great
violence
upon
the
village
of
gheluvelt
the
first
and
third
brigades
or
the
first
division
were
swept
back
and
the
first
coldstream
guards
were
wiped
out
as
a
unit
the
whole
division
was
driven
back
from
gheluvelt
to
the
woods
between
veldhoek
and
hooge
the
allied
headquarters
at
hooge
were
shelled
general
lomas
was
wounded
and
six
or
the
staff
officers
were
killed
the
royal
fusiliers
who
desperately
stuck
to
their
trenches
fighting
savagely
were
cut
off
and
destroyed
out
of
a
thousand
but
seventy
soldiers
remained
between
two
and
three
there
occurred
the
most
desperate
fighting
seen
in
the
battle
of
ypres
at
in
the
afternoon
the
allies
recaptured
gheluvelt
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
by
evening
the
allies
had
regained
their
position
ypres
had
not
been
captured
by
the
germans
by
this
time
but
they
had
secured
their
position
in
all
the
suburbs
of
ypres
and
had
that
city
at
their
mercy
provided
allied
reenforcements
ordered
up
did
not
obstruct
their
path
the
fighting
still
continued
for
part
of
november
but
for
the
month
of
october
no
definite
result
was
to
be
recorded
at
ypres
on
november
the
germans
captured
english
troops
and
many
machine
guns
dixmude
was
stormed
by
the
germans
on
the
of
november
and
they
crossed
the
yser
canal
capturing
the
allies
position
west
of
langemark
also
driving
them
out
of
eloi
snow
and
floods
interfered
with
the
fighting
along
the
battle
front
ypres
was
bombarded
on
several
occasions
and
was
repeatedly
set
on
fire
november
was
another
day
of
severe
fighting
at
daybreak
the
germans
opened
fire
on
the
allied
trenches
to
the
north
and
south
of
the
road
from
menin
to
ypres
after
a
furious
artillery
fire
the
germans
drove
their
men
forward
in
full
force
this
attack
was
carried
out
by
the
first
and
fourth
brigades
of
the
prussian
guard
corps
which
had
been
especially
selected
to
capture
ypres
if
possible
since
that
task
had
proved
too
heavy
for
the
infantry
of
the
line
as
the
germans
surged
forward
they
were
met
by
a
frontal
fire
from
the
allied
lines
and
as
they
were
moving
diagonally
across
part
of
the
allied
front
they
were
also
attacked
on
the
flank
by
the
english
artillery
though
the
casualties
of
the
germans
were
enormous
before
they
reached
the
english
lines
such
was
their
resolution
and
the
momentum
of
the
mass
that
in
spite
of
the
splendid
resistance
of
the
english
troops
the
germans
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
allied
lines
in
several
places
near
the
road
they
penetrated
some
distance
into
the
woods
behind
the
english
trenches
where
some
of
the
bloodiest
fighting
of
the
entire
war
took
place
on
november
comparative
quiet
reigned
and
with
the
exception
of
artillery
duels
and
some
desultory
fighting
no
results
were
obtained
on
either
side
the
british
report
makes
this
comment
on
this
attempt
upon
ypres
their
the
prussian
guard
corps
dogged
perseverance
in
pursuance
of
their
objective
claims
wholehearted
admiration
the
failure
of
one
great
attack
heralded
as
it
was
by
an
impassioned
appeal
to
the
troops
made
in
the
presence
of
the
emperor
himself
but
carried
out
by
partially
trained
men
has
been
only
the
signal
for
another
desperate
effort
in
which
the
place
of
honor
was
assigned
to
the
corps
of
the
german
army
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
guard
corps
has
retained
that
reputation
for
courage
and
contempt
of
death
which
it
earned
in
when
emperor
william
i
after
the
battle
of
gravelotte
wrote
guard
has
formed
its
grave
in
front
of
privat
and
the
swarms
of
men
who
came
up
bravely
to
the
british
rifles
in
the
woods
around
ypres
repeated
the
tactics
of
years
ago
when
their
dense
columns
toiling
up
the
slopes
of
privat
melted
away
under
the
fire
of
the
french
ypres
was
now
but
a
name
nothing
but
a
mass
of
ruins
reminded
the
world
of
its
previous
quaint
splendor
for
ypres
had
been
rich
in
historic
buildings
and
monuments
of
past
days
with
the
fall
of
antwerp
the
germans
had
made
every
effort
to
push
forward
strong
forces
toward
the
west
and
had
hastened
to
bring
up
new
army
corps
which
had
been
hurriedly
organized
their
object
being
to
drive
the
allies
out
of
belgium
and
break
through
to
dunkirk
and
calais
altogether
they
collected
fresh
men
eventually
the
germans
had
north
of
la
bassée
about
fourteen
corps
and
eight
cavalry
divisions
a
force
of
men
with
which
to
attempt
to
drive
the
allies
into
the
sea
in
addition
there
was
immensely
powerful
armament
and
heavy
siege
artillery
which
also
had
been
brought
up
from
around
antwerp
but
in
spite
of
these
strong
forces
it
became
clearly
evident
by
the
middle
of
november
that
the
attempt
to
break
through
to
calais
had
failed
for
the
time
being
the
flooding
of
the
yser
marks
the
end
of
the
main
struggle
for
calais
the
battle
fronts
had
shifted
between
them
there
was
a
mile
or
two
of
mud
and
water
the
belgians
had
lost
a
quarter
of
their
effectives
the
germans
had
evacuated
the
west
bank
of
the
yser
and
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
started
chapter
xxviii
attacks
on
la
bassee
and
arras
while
the
engagement
on
the
yser
was
in
progress
in
october
fierce
fighting
was
kept
up
in
the
second
section
of
the
battle
front
pivoting
on
givenchy
to
the
south
and
running
east
to
the
north
of
the
la
road
in
this
section
the
forces
of
the
crown
prince
of
bavaria
opposed
the
troops
under
the
command
of
general
from
october
to
considerable
fighting
went
on
in
the
flats
east
of
arras
between
lens
and
the
river
scarpe
this
resulted
in
the
retirement
of
the
allies
on
the
the
germans
began
to
bombard
arras
keeping
it
up
until
the
when
their
attempt
to
take
the
city
next
day
was
successfully
repulsed
on
october
the
germans
then
holding
douai
and
lens
were
shelling
lille
then
held
by
the
british
territorials
for
the
next
two
weeks
artillery
duels
alternated
with
trench
fighting
and
skirmishing
the
main
attack
at
la
bassée
covered
fully
ten
days
lasting
from
october
to
november
the
first
severe
fighting
came
as
has
already
been
mentioned
on
october
the
british
were
driven
out
of
the
village
of
violaines
which
is
situated
on
the
road
between
lorgies
and
givenchy
and
general
was
compelled
to
retreat
to
the
village
of
faugissant
to
the
south
of
lavantie
on
october
the
germans
attacked
heavily
along
the
entire
line
and
the
first
gordon
highlanders
were
driven
out
of
their
trenches
for
three
days
the
most
savage
fighting
continued
resulting
in
the
capture
of
neuve
chapelle
by
the
germans
on
october
which
was
defended
by
east
indian
troops
the
fighting
was
desperate
on
both
sides
and
became
much
confused
as
units
here
and
there
had
succeeded
in
breaking
through
their
respective
opponents
lines
all
of
this
day
and
the
next
october
this
struggle
continued
but
the
germans
maintained
the
ground
they
had
won
forcing
the
allied
forces
to
retire
in
order
to
their
lines
on
october
the
germans
attacked
at
festubert
and
gained
several
of
the
allied
trenches
after
a
severe
struggle
lasting
throughout
the
day
again
the
germans
maintained
their
new
position
compelling
the
indian
troops
to
retire
to
the
defense
of
the
la
bassée
gate
where
they
were
joined
by
several
british
brigades
and
the
second
corps
artillery
october
was
consumed
in
continuous
artillery
duels
which
held
the
lines
while
the
troops
enjoyed
much
needed
rest
on
october
the
indian
forces
were
again
savagely
attacked
by
the
germans
whose
machine
guns
enfiladed
them
in
their
trenches
this
attack
has
become
noted
for
the
great
loss
of
british
officers
commanding
the
hindus
concurrent
with
this
fighting
the
germans
also
made
the
most
savage
onslaughts
further
south
with
the
object
of
capturing
arras
the
main
attack
against
this
important
french
city
began
on
october
and
lasted
six
days
until
the
evening
of
october
the
germans
in
having
possession
of
lens
had
a
great
advantage
as
they
were
thereby
enabled
to
threaten
the
allied
left
center
which
was
stationed
to
the
west
of
lens
for
just
south
from
the
town
ran
a
railway
which
connected
with
the
main
line
three
miles
east
of
arras
called
the
line
this
gave
the
germans
a
perfect
system
of
lateral
communications
the
german
general
von
bülow
commanding
the
prussian
guard
corps
led
the
attack
on
october
when
he
pushed
his
forces
fighting
for
every
inch
of
the
ground
to
within
gun
range
of
the
city
of
arras
all
day
the
most
desperate
fighting
continued
and
had
not
general
received
the
reenforcements
which
hurriedly
came
up
just
when
needed
the
northern
gates
of
arras
would
have
been
gained
by
the
germans
who
were
held
back
in
a
position
near
enough
however
to
subject
arras
to
another
bombardment
and
the
shell
fire
from
this
position
rained
upon
arras
to
the
end
of
the

sectors
of
this
front
were
being
continually
changed
making
it
difficult
to
name
the
commanders
in
each
sector
except
when
some
more
or
less
noteworthy
engagement
had
taken
place
along
the
line
the
battle
front
here
described
did
not
materially
change
throughout
the
months
of
october
to
february
continual
engagements
took
place
along
this
entire
front
a
gain
of
a
few
yards
here
balanced
by
a
loss
of
a
like
distance
elsewhere
both
belligerents
had
securely
intrenched
themselves
the
pickax
and
spade
were
far
more
in
use
than
the
rifle
so
that
now
cold
weather
coming
on
the
soldiers
on
both
sides
of
the
front
were
able
to
make
the
trenches
quite
comfortable
in
many
instances
they
laid
down
plank
floors
and
lined
the
walls
with
boards
put
up
stoves
constructed
sleeping
bunks
and
tables
stools
and
benches
and
even
decorated
the
rooms
thus
evolved
with
anything
suitable
for
the
purpose
pictures
and
photographs
from
home
were
the
favorite
decorations
all
this
was
impossible
for
their
brethren
in
the
north
and
in
flanders
where
the
activities
of
the
conflict
subjected
the
soldiers
to
continual
changes
and
removals
the
main
objective
of
the
germans
was
the
french
fortresses
belfort
epinal
toul
and
verdun
for
these
obstructed
the
march
to
paris
the
continual
onslaughts
and
counterassaults
made
upon
this
line
left
it
practically
unchanged
during
the
month
of
october
in
which
time
no
engagements
worthy
of
the
name
battle
occurred
the
fighting
in
the
north
had
been
so
desperate
that
it
completely
obscured
the
activities
on
the
entire
line
to
the
south
the
net
gains
during
the
months
of
october
and
november
for
either
belligerent
were
practically
nil
from
belfort
in
the
south
to
arras
in
the
north
the
advance
or
retreat
in
any
given
section
was
but
a
matter
of
yards
a
ridge
a
farm
a
hill
or
other
choice
gun
position
the
farther
bank
of
a
rivulet
or
stream
or
canal
occupied
or
captured
here
by
the
french
there
by
the
germans
generally
proved
to
be
but
temporary
possessions
and
wasted
efforts
it
was
incidents
such
as
these
that
made
up
the
record
of
events
along
this
line
during
all
this
time
the
military
aeroplanes
were
busy
dropping
explosives
upon
the
enemy
lines
and
extending
their
operations
far
to
the
rear
circling
above
the
larger
towns
and
cities
doing
considerable
damage
in
many
places
but
this
was
not
the
only
purpose
of
these
daring
sky
pilots
for
the
principal
object
in
flying
over
the
adversary
country
was
to
make
observations
and
report
movements
of
troops
in
this
respect
the
aeroplane
had
done
immense
service
throughout
the
campaign
chapter
xxix
general
movements
on
the
french
and
flanders
fronts
we
have
seen
that
at
the
end
of
november
ypres
was
still
in
the
allies
hands
though
the
germans
were
exerting
a
fierce
pressure
in
that
region
and
were
gradually
even
if
very
slowly
getting
closer
and
closer
to
it
at
the
beginning
of
december
the
germans
drew
their
forces
close
up
to
ypres
so
closely
in
fact
that
they
could
bring
into
play
their
howitzers
and
before
many
hours
ypres
was
in
flames
in
many
places
the
allied
forces
fought
fiercely
to
compel
the
germans
to
withdraw
fighting
bayonet
charges
and
general
confusion
was
the
order
of
the
day
thousands
of
men
would
creep
out
of
their
holes
in
the
ground
and
crawl
availing
themselves
of
whatever
covering
presented
itself
to
some
vantage
point
and
there
stand
up
as
one
man
and
charge
directly
into
the
adversary
ranks
all
this
was
part
of
the
general
scheme
worked
out
miles
from
the
spot
where
the
conflict
was
going
on
there
in
some
quaint
little
town
occupying
some
house
was
the
general
staff
the
rooms
were
filled
with
officers
the
walls
were
hung
with
large
and
small
field
and
detail
maps
upon
which
were
plainly
marked
the
name
of
every
commanding
officer
and
the
forces
under
his
command
every
detail
of
the
armies
strength
names
of
the
commanders
and
any
other
detail
was
plainly
in
view
it
was
here
decided
to
turn
the
entire
command
of
the
allied
forces
along
the
yser
over
to
the
british
to
avoid
confusion
it
was
well
that
this
was
done
just
at
this
time
for
on
december
the
germans
made
a
fierce
onslaught
along
the
entire
front
of
thirteen
miles
between
ypres
and
dixmude
bringing
into
use
a
great
number
of
stanch
rafts
propelled
by
expert
watermen
thus
carrying
thousands
of
the
german
forces
over
and
along
the
ypres
river
again
the
belligerents
came
to
a
conflict
and
so
well
directed
was
the
allied
counterattack
that
no
advantage
to
the
germans
was
obtained
for
three
days
this
severe
fighting
continued
the
struggle
was
most
sharp
between
dixmude
and
the
coast
at
westende
where
the
germans
hoped
to
break
through
the
allied
lines
and
thus
crumple
up
their
entire
front
making
a
free
passage
on
december
the
french
captured
vermelles
a
minor
village
a
few
miles
southwest
of
la
bassée
this
little
village
had
been
the
center
of
a
continuous
struggle
for
mastership
for
nearly
two
months
at
last
the
french
occupied
this
rather
commanding
point
important
to
the
allies
as
it
afforded
an
excellent
view
over
a
wide
stretch
of
country
occupied
by
the
germans
the
german
staff
headquarters
were
removed
from
roulers
which
is
about
twelve
miles
distant
from
ypres
on
december
from
the
vicinity
of
ypres
while
their
own
forces
had
been
concentrated
upon
dixmude
twelve
miles
to
the
north
this
town
had
suffered
severely
before
but
the
allied
forces
using
what
shelter
they
could
improvise
were
doing
considerable
damage
from
this
point
therefore
the
germans
began
to
bombard
the
place
on
december
the
germans
succeeded
in
gaining
slightly
toward
ypres
farther
north
they
were
by
this
time
also
in
a
position
to
take
furnes
under
fire
this
town
lies
on
the
frontier
between
belgium
and
france
in
the
path
of
some
of
the
most
savage
onslaughts
on
the
part
of
the
germans
to
break
through
the
allied
lines
in
order
to
reach
the
channel
towns
of
dunkirk
and
calais
on
december
the
allied
forces
made
an
ineffectual
attack
on
roulers
which
the
german
general
staff
had
just
left
south
of
ypres
the
allied
forces
made
a
severe
attack
upon
the
town
of
armentières
about
eight
miles
from
ypres
but
gained
no
permanent
advantage
during
this
time
the
germans
had
also
so
far
succeeded
in
consolidating
their
positions
in
the
neighborhood
of
ostend
that
they
could
put
their
heavy
guns
in
position
near
the
shores
of
that
famous
watering
place
this
was
a
very
necessary
precaution
to
meet
the
attacks
of
english
gunboats
and
even
larger
cruisers
that
were
patrolling
that
coast
on
december
the
severest
fighting
was
along
the
yser
canal
which
was
crossed
and
recrossed
several
times
on
december
the
allies
succeeded
in
repulsing
the
germans
on
the
river
lys
where
for
three
days
the
germans
had
inaugurated
a
hot
offensive
these
engagements
were
exact
counterparts
of
the
fighting
at
other
points
in
flanders
where
both
opponents
were
apparently
well
matched
and
where
advantages
were
won
and
lost
in
rapid
succession
there
was
severe
fighting
also
on
december
extending
along
the
entire
front
in
flanders
from
nieuport
to
below
ypres
in
the
north
the
germans
made
severe
onslaughts
all
more
or
less
held
up
or
repulsed
by
the
belgians
french
and
english
the
fighting
was
hottest
near
nieuport
where
the
allies
made
some
small
temporary
gains
besides
the
three
armies
participating
in
the
conflict
the
british
fleet
also
took
part
in
bombarding
the
german
coast
positions
three
british
barges
equipped
with
naval
machine
guns
entered
the
river
yser
in
order
to
cooperate
in
the
fighting
these
boats
took
the
two
villages
lombaertzyde
and
georges
in
this
action
some
of
the
heaviest
fighting
was
done
by
the
french
marines
some
slight
advantages
were
also
gained
by
the
allies
in
the
neighborhood
of
eloi
and
klein
zillebeke
following
these
minor
successes
attack
was
made
upon
the
german
lines
on
the
west
side
of
wytschaete
a
village
which
the
germans
had
succeeded
in
holding
during
the
great
battle
of
ypres
to
the
west
of
this
village
is
a
wood
called
the
petit
bois
and
to
the
southwest
is
the
maedelsteed
spur
an
eminence
on
hilly
ground
from
both
of
these
places
the
germans
covered
the
village
prepared
to
hold
it
against
all
comers
major
duncan
commanding
the
scots
and
major
baird
leading
the
royal
highlanders
attacked
the
petit
bois
and
in
the
flare
of
terrible
machine
gun
and
rifle
fire
carried
a
trench
west
of
the
woods
while
the
gordon
highlanders
advanced
upon
the
spur
taking
the
first
trench
they
were
however
obliged
to
fall
back
to
the
position
from
which
they
had
started
with
no
advantage
gained
this
engagement
at
wytschaete
gave
a
good
illustration
of
the
difficulty
of
fighting
in
heavy
winter
ground
devoid
of
cover
and
so
that
any
speed
in
advance
was
next
to
impossible
just
prior
to
the
battle
the
ground
had
thawed
and
the
soldiers
sank
deep
into
the
mud
at
every
step
they
took
on
december
the
germans
attacked
a
little
to
the
south
of
ypres
but
no
definite
result
was
obtained
on
the
following
day
the
allies
replied
by
an
onslaught
at
dixmude
with
a
similar
result
the
germans
attempted
to
turn
and
strike
at
westende
the
next
day
roulers
was
temporarily
occupied
by
the
allies
on
december
and
in
another
location
about
miles
farther
southwest
in
the
neighborhood
of
givenchy
the
allies
indian
troops
were
put
to
the
test
the
attack
was
launched
on
the
morning
of
the
the
lahore
and
the
meerut
divisions
both
took
part
the
meerut
division
succeeded
in
capturing
a
trench
but
a
little
later
on
a
counterattack
launched
by
the
germans
forced
the
indians
back
the
lahore
division
including
the
first
highland
light
infantry
and
the
fourth
gurkhas
took
two
lines
of
the
enemy
trenches
with
hardly
any
casualties
these
captured
trenches
were
at
once
occupied
and
when
they
were
full
to
capacity
the
germans
exploded
the
previously
prepared
mines
and
blew
up
the
entire
hindu
force
at
daylight
on
the
morning
of
december
the
germans
commenced
a
heavy
artillery
fire
along
the
entire
front
this
was
followed
by
an
infantry
charge
along
the
entire
line
between
givenchy
and
la
quinque
rue
to
the
north
the
defense
of
givenchy
was
in
the
hands
of
the
india
sirhind
brigade
under
general
brunker
at
ten
the
sirhinds
became
confused
and
fled
enabling
the
germans
to
capture
givenchy
the
rifles
and
the
ninth
bhopals
were
stationed
north
of
la
bassée
canal
and
east
of
givenchy
and
the
connaught
rangers
were
waiting
at
the
south
of
the
canal
the
sikhs
were
sent
to
support
the
sirhind
brigade
with
the
first
manchesters
the
fourth
suffolks
and
two
battalions
of
french
provincials
the
entire
force
being
under
command
of
general
carnegy
all
these
mixed
forces
now
essayed
a
combined
counterattack
in
order
to
recover
the
ground
lost
by
the
sirhind
brigade
but
this
failed
the
allies
called
up
reserves
and
the
ranks
broken
by
that
day
reverses
with
the
seventh
dragoon
guards
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
colonel
lemprière
they
began
another
attack
this
too
failed
when
the
sirhind
brigade
fell
back
the
seaforth
highlanders
were
left
entirely
exposed
the
rifles
went
to
the
support
of
their
left
throughout
the
entire
afternoon
the
seaforths
had
made
strenuous
efforts
to
capture
the
german
trenches
to
the
right
and
left
of
their
position
upon
the
arrival
of
the
the
fighting
redoubled
in
ferocity
but
no
advance
was
made
finally
word
was
given
to
retreat
the
allies
lost
heavily
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
the
first
brigade
was
detached
and
by
midnight
it
had
reached
bethune
about
five
miles
west
of
givenchy
sir
douglas
haig
was
ordered
to
move
also
the
entire
first
division
in
support
of
the
exhausted
indian
troops
action
was
begun
on
december
early
in
the
afternoon
by
a
simultaneous
attack
and
was
continued
until
nightfall
without
important
results
the
next
morning
general
haig
in
person
took
the
command
but
little
ground
was
gained
while
this
contest
was
in
progress
around
givenchy
the
germans
took
possession
of
the
city
of
arras
ten
miles
to
the
south
between
december
and
the
belgian
army
strongly
reenforced
by
french
troops
began
a
series
of
violent
attacks
upon
the
german
lines
but
the
germans
replied
by
a
ceaseless
bombardment
of
nieuport
which
is
about
a
mile
inland
no
results
of
importance
were
obtained
on
either
side
the
last
week
of
december
bore
a
relieving
holiday
aspect
for
it
seemed
as
though
by
general
consent
the
carnival
of
mood
was
to
be
considered
not
consonant
with
the
solemnity
of
the
season
but
for
all
that
the
french
succeeded
in
blowing
up
some
german
trenches
with
a
new
howitzer
they
were
anxious
to
tryout
and
the
forces
retook
georges
in
northern
flanders
georges
had
been
held
by
the
germans
for
some
time
the
village
stands
on
the
right
hand
of
the
yser
and
it
was
the
only
position
they
retained
on
that
side
of
the
river
it
seems
from
the
very
ease
with
which
the
village
was
taken
that
the
germans
felt
their
position
there
untenable
and
withdrew
to
their
own
side
of
the
river
in
order
to
enjoy
a
quiet
christmas
with
their
comrades
whose
singing
of
christmas
songs
was
forever
being
wafted
over
that
river
of
blood
although
the
general
action
continued
on
both
sides
no
serious
battles
are
to
be
recorded
in
flanders
for
the
balance
of

operations
around

and

on
the
whole
the
results
obtained
during
the
first
days
of
on
the
belgian
battle
front
favored
the
germans
of
this
front
the
belgians
held
but
three
miles
more
or
less
and
the
british
were
defending
a
line
of
about
twenty
miles
while
the
french
covered
the
balance
of
about
twelve
miles
all
of
which
included
about
the
entire
front
in
flanders
from
the
dunes
at
nieuport
on
the
channel
to
armentières
in
the
south
a

by
no

straight
about
miles
in
length
activities
along
the
extended
front
in
the
champagne
district
having
proved
successful
for
the
german
forces
to
a
considerable
extent
the
general
staff
turned
its
attention
now
to
the
la
bassée
region
there
was
good
tactical
reason
for
this
move
because
the
british
were
seriously
threatening
the
position
straddling
la
bassée
canal
where
it
flows
between
cuinchy
and
givenchy
and
there
was
danger
that
they
might
capture
la
bassée
where
the
germans
held
a
salient
of
considerable
strategical
importance
as
it
covered
their
line
of
communication
to
the
south
previous
successful
operations
by
the
british
at
richebourg
and
festubert
north
of
givenchy
and
at
vermelles
south
of
cuinchy
evidently
prompted
the
germans
to
attempt
a
counterattack
besides
it
was
desirable
for
the
germans
to
test
the
strength
of
the
allies
at
this
point
and
to
do
this
with
some
measure
of
success
the
germans
massed
a
considerable
force
for
this
purpose
beginning
about
january
the
british
met
with
varying
and
minor
successes
and
defeats
in
this
region
but
no
noteworthy
action
had
taken
place
for
upward
of
ten
days
until
january
under
the
eye
of
the
german
kaiser
the
principal
attack
which
had
been
carefully
planned
took
place
on
the
morning
of
january
a
demonstration
along
the
front
from
festubert
to
vermelles
and
as
far
north
as
ypres
and
pervyse
was
inaugurated
the
germans
began
to
shell
bethune
which
was
within
the
allied
lines
about
eight
or
nine
miles
west
of
la
bassée
an
hour
later
in
the
neighborhood
of
nine
following
up
heavy
artillery
fire
the
prussian
infantry
and
the
seventh
pioneers
advanced
south
of
the
canal
which
runs
eastward
from
bethune
where
the
british
line
formed
a
salient
from
the
canal
forward
to
the
railway
near
cuinchy
and
thence
back
to
the
bethune
and
la
bassée
road
where
the
british
joined
the
french
forces
this
salient
was
occupied
by
the
scots
and
the
coldstream
guards
the
germans
were
obliged
to
advance
by
the
road
as
the
fields
were
too
soft
for
the
passage
of
the
troops
even
the
roads
were
in
a
terrible
condition
deep
ruts
and
thick
sticky
mud
greatly
retarding
the
onward
march
of
the
german
forces
but
the
allies
fared
little
better
in
this
respect
in
fact
the
entire
engagement
was
fought
out
in
a
veritable
sea
of
mud
and
slush
artillery
fire
by
the
germans
blew
up
the
british
trenches
in
this
salient
and
the
germans
at
once
penetrated
the
unsupported
british
line
the
germans
also
had
the
advantage
of
an
armored
train
which
they
ran
along
the
tracks
from
la
bassée
almost
into
bethune
sufficiently
close
to
throw
considerable
shell
fire
into
this
town
the
germans
advanced
in
close
formation
throwing
hand
grenades
they
came
on
so
rapidly
and
with
such
momentum
that
the
guards
trying
in
vain
to
stem
the
tide
with
the
bayonet
were
overwhelmed
and
the
british
in
spite
of
desperate
resistance
were
forced
back
step
by
step
at
some
points
the
distance
between
the
trenches
was
so
small
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
stop
the
onrush
from
one
trench
to
the
other
the
germans
swept
and
broke
through
the
british
lines
treading
their
fallen
opponents
under
foot
as
they
advanced
at
this
point
the
british
turned
and
fled
as
there
was
no
hope
of
successful
resistance
as
the
great
momentum
forced
the
german
advance
through
the
allied
lines
into
the
open
field
beyond
and
was
joined
by
a
heavy
column
which
had
debouched
from
the
vicinity
of
auchy
british
guns
opened
a
murderous
fire
and
inflicted
terrible
slaughter
upon
these
ranks
the
coldstream
and
the
scots
guards
retreated
to
their
second
line
of
defense
where
they
joined
others
of
their
command
held
in
reserve
there
once
again
they
turned
to
meet
the
oncoming
germans
and
again
were
forced
to
give
way
leaving
the
germans
in
possession
of
all
the
ground
previously
gained
the
remnants
of
the
guards
retreated
until
they
were
met
by
the
regiment
sent
to
reenforce
them
here
they
halted
while
a
counterattack
was
being
organized
by
the
first
royal
highlanders
part
of
the
camerons
and
the
second
king
rifle
corps
which
also
came
up
at
one
on
january
and
with
the
cooperation
of
the
french
on
their
right
this
rapidly
improvised
force
moved
forward
making
unobstructed
progress
on
their
wings
by
the
canal
and
the
road
for
some
reason
their
center
was
delayed
and
held
back
when
they
did
finally
arrive
and
pressed
forward
with
a
rush
to
meet
the
german
forces
who
were
ready
to
receive
them
the
impact
was
fearful
and
the
casualties
on
both
sides
enormous
but
no
gains
were
made
by
the
allies
and
the
germans
held
the
ground
they
had
won
at
the
height
of
the
battle
the
second
royal
sussex
rushed
into
the
fray
in
support
of
their
comrades
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
these
as
the
others
were
forced
back
to
the
rear
of
their
starting
point
with
but
a
fraction
of
their
forces
remaining
to
report
the
events
of
the
day
while
this
terrible
slaughter
was
in
progress
the
french
left
on
the
other
side
of
la
bassée
road
which
separated
the
allies
at
this
point
had
been
attacked
by
the
right
of
the
german
line
and
driven
back
to
a
considerable
distance
but
not
as
far
back
as
the
british
so
that
the
french
left
was
in
advance
of
the
british
right
and
badly
exposed
to
flank
attack
from
the
northward
this
obliged
the
entire
allied
forces
to
retreat
some
distance
farther
to
the
rear
and
as
night
came
on
and
the
severity
or
the
action
had
ceased
the
allies
had
an
opportunity
to
realign
their
positions
and
somewhat
strengthen
the
same
by
the
first
guard
brigade
which
now
came
up
showing
the
terrible
suffering
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
finally
however
it
was
found
advisable
to
withdraw
the
guard
altogether
and
replace
them
by
the
first
infantry
brigade
now
the
german
tactical
idea
became
clear
it
was
to
force
the
british
to
concentrate
on
the
exposed
line
between
festubert
and
givenchy
north
of
the
canal
and
then
to
turn
the
british
right
by
the
german
forces
in
their
new
position
just
south
of
the
canal
thus
calling
for
simultaneous
action
on
both
sides
of
the
canal
the
germans
delivered
an
equally
severe
attack
upon
the
allied
position
in
the
village
of
givenchy
about
a
mile
north
of
the
canal
which
bounded
the
scene
of
the
attack
just
described
as
in
the
other
attack
the
germans
opened
action
by
severe
artillery
fire
using
shells
and
after
due
preparation
at
about
in
the
morning
the
infantry
advanced
as
is
customary
with
the
germans
in
close
formation
the
british
met
this
advance
by
somewhat
weak
artillery
fire
which
it
was
afterward
explained
was
due
to
continued
interruption
of
the
telephonic
communications
between
the
observers
and
the
batteries
in
the
fight
however
as
it
was
this
fire
added
to
the
machine
gun
and
rifle
fire
from
the
trenches
served
to
turn
the
german
advance
from
their
original
direction
with
the
result
that
they
crowded
together
in
the
northeast
corner
of
givenchy
after
passing
over
the
trenches
of
the
allies
front
their
momentum
carried
the
germans
far
into
the
center
of
the
village
with
remarkably
few
casualties
considering
the
murderous
fire
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
throughout
their
impetuous
advances
in
the
village
of
givenchy
however
the
second
welsh
regiment
and
the
first
south
wales
borderers
which
had
been
stationed
there
and
held
in
reserve
gave
the
germans
a
warm
reception
and
when
the
first
royal
highlanders
came
up
they
delivered
a
fierce
counterattack
in
this
they
were
supported
by
the
fire
of
the
french
artillery
which
assistance
however
proved
costly
to
the
allies
as
the
french
fire
and
bursting
shells
killed
friend
and
foe
alike
street
fighting
became
savage
amid
the
explosions
of
shells
sent
to
enliven
the
occasion
by
the
french
this
concluded
the
action
for
the
day
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
both
sides
found
their
position
comparatively
little
changed
and
nothing
but
the
thinned
ranks
of
the
combatants
reminded
the
observer
that
the
most
severe
kind
of
fighting
had
taken
place
for
the
best
part
of
a
day
the
following
day
january
the
action
was
resumed
and
the
attack
opened
along
the
bethune
and
la
bassée
road
this
soon
died
out
as
though
by
general
consent
each
side
reoccupying
their
position
of
the
previous
evening
but
on
friday
january
early
in
the
morning
the
germans
again
opened
with
severe
artillery
fire
which
directed
its
attention
particularly
to
the
british
line
where
the
first
army
corps
lay
between
la
bassée
canal
and
the
bethune
road
near
cutchy
after
an
hour
shelling
the
germans
sent
one
battalion
of
the
fourteenth
corps
toward
the
redoubt
and
two
battalions
of
the
same
corps
were
sent
to
the
north
and
south
of
this
redoubt
now
upon
this
point
and
to
the
north
of
it
stood
the
sussex
regiment
and
to
the
south
of
it
the
northamptonshire
regiment
the
attack
was
severe
but
the
defense
was
equal
to
it
and
the
net
results
were
summed
up
in
the
casualty
lists
on
both
sides
an
attack
upon
the
french
south
of
bethune
on
the
same
day
met
with
like
results
the
great
german
objective
was
to
open
another
road
to
dunkirk
and
calais
and
had
they
been
successful
in
the
engagements
of
the
past
few
days
it
is
probable
that
they
would
have
succeeded
to
the
north
in
the
coast
district
the
belgians
had
succeeded
in
flooding
a
vast
area
which
served
for
the
time
to
separate
the
combatants
for
a
considerable
distance
obliging
the
germans
to
resort
to
rafts
boats
and
other
floating
apparatus
to
carry
on
a
somewhat
haphazard
offensive
and
resulting
in
nothing
more
than
a
change
from
gunfire
slaughter
to
drowning
the
immense
inconvenience
attendant
to
this
mode
of
warfare
decided
the
germans
to
drain
this
area
and
they
succeeded
in
doing
this
by
the
end
of
january
on
the
other
hand
the
belgians
captured
two
german
trenches
in
the
north
on
january
and
the
british
sent
a
force
to
attack
lille
on
january
the
belgian
trenches
were
reoccupied
by
the
germans
and
the
lille
attack
was
successfully
repulsed
then
for
a
week
there
was
nothing
of
importance
until
january
when
the
germans
made
a
strong
attack
upon
ypres
which
was
repulsed
on
january
the
germans
recaptured
georges
and
bombarded
a
few
of
the
towns
and
villages
harboring
allied
troops
the
belgians
continued
in
their
endeavor
to
flood
the
german
position
along
the
yser
on
january
and
succeeded
in
obliging
their
opponents
to
vacate
for
a
time
at
least
and
on
the
last
day
of
january
allied
forces
consisting
of
zouaves
gurkhas
and
other
indian
companies
made
an
attack
upon
the
german
trenches
upon
the
dunes
at
lombaertzyde
gaining
a
temporary
advantage
at
an
expense
of
considerable
loss
in
casualties
in
reviewing
the
activities
during
the
month
of
january
the
disagreeable
state
of
the
weather
must
be
taken
into
consideration
this
resulted
in
terrible
suffering
to
which
the
battling
forces
were
subjected
during
the
actual
fighting
and
even
more
so
while
at
rest
either
on
the
open
field
or
in
the
questionable
comfort
of
an
inhospitable
and
leaky
trench
while
every
effort
was
made
by
the
respective
general
staffs
to
supply
their
fighting
troops
with
such
comforts
as
were
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
in
trim
for
the
next
day
work
little
could
be
accomplished
and
it
is
a
marvel
how
these
poor
soldiers
did
withstand
the
rigorous
weather
which
blighted
the
prospect
of
victory

dear

the
fighting
was
mostly
artillery
duels
and
skirmishes
by
separate
units
in

argonne
however
the

was
active
and
there
as
well
as
along

on

many
engagements
were
fought
out
resulting
in

both
sides
had
been
strongly
intrenched

the

was
covered
by

upon

on

the
french
captured

in

only
to
give
up
their
advantage
after

attacked
in
the
woevre

and
in

but
were
repulsed

in

was
in

the
french

attacked
during

drenching

pushing
up
the
rising
ground
to
the
north
with
their
heavy
guns
regardless
of
the
soft
ground
which
rapidly
turned
to
deep
mud
and
slush
they
succeeded
in
carrying
the
first
line
of
german
trenches
on
a
front
a
mile
wide
thus
gaining
the
top
of
the
hill
which
gave
them
an
excellent
position
for
their
artillery
the
next
day

counterattacked
but

dislodge
the
french
nothing
occurred
on
sunday

but
on
monday
about
noon
january
the
germans
came
on
with
great
force
the
delay
on
the
part
of
the
germans
was
due
to
their
awaiting
reenforcements
then
on
the
road
to
soissons
for
four
days
there
had
been
a
steady
downpour
of
rain
which
had
not
even
stopped
at
this
time
the
river
aisne
was
much
swollen
and
some
of
the
bridges
had
been
carried
away
cutting
off
all
supplies
for
the
french
who
were
slowly
giving
way
but
fighting
desperately
on
january
and
on
the
the
french
were
driven
down
the
slopes
in
a
great
rush
this
predicament
was
a
terrible
one
the
onrushing
germans
feet
in
front
of
them
and
the
swollen
river
making
successful
retreat
impossible
with
the
ground
between
almost
impassable
with
mud
and
slush
french
reserves
had
improvised
a
pontoon
bridge
across
the
aisne
at
missy
in
the
rear
of
their
now
precarious
position
this
bridge
was
just
strong
enough
to
carry
the
men
and
ammunition
but
not
the
heavy
guns
the
retreat
turned
into
a
rout
a
general
stampede
for
the
bridge
and
river
the
slaughter
was
terrible
the
river
swollen
as
it
was
seemed
choked
with
floating

safely
got
across
the
bridge
and
those
who
were
successful
in
reaching
the
farther
bank
of
the
aisne
alive
reached
soissons
eventually
the
german
gain
in
prisoners
and
booty
was
enormous
and
their
gain
in

advanced
their
line
a
full
mile
on

five
miles
to

the

thus
causing
a
collapse
of

and
dragging
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
into
the
maelstrom
of
war
this
chapter
will
review
the
navies
as
they
gather
for
action
it
will
follow
them
through
the
tense
moments
on
shipboard
the
days
of
watching
and
waiting
like
huge
sea
dogs
tugging
at
the
leash
interspersed
are
heroic
adventures
which
have
added
new
tales
of
valor
to
the
epics
of
the
sea
the
naval
history
of
the
great
european
conflict
begins
not
with
the
first
of
the
series
of
declarations
of
war
but
with
the
preliminary
preparations
the
appointment
of
admiral
von
tirpitz
as
secretary
of
state
in
germany
in
is
the
first
decisive
movement
it
was
in
that
year
that
the
first
rival
to
england
as
mistress
of
the
world
seas
since
the
days
of
the
spanish
armada
peeped
over
the
horizon
two
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
von
tirpitz
organized
a
campaign
the
object
of
which
was
to
make
germany
navy
as
strong
as
her
military
arm
a
law
passed
at
that
time
created
the
present
german
fleet
supplementary
laws
passed
in
and
through
the
reichstag
by
this
former
plowboy
caused
the
german
navy
to
be
taken
seriously
not
only
by
germans
but
by
the
rest
of
the
world
england
jealous
of
her
sea
power
then
began
her
maintenance
of
two
ships
for
each
one
or
her
rival
germany
answered
by
laying
more
keels
till
the
ratio
stood
three
to
two
instead
of
two
to
one
two
years
before
the
firing
of
the
pistol
shot
at
sarajevo
which
precipitated
the
great
war
the
british
admiralty
announced
that
henceforth
the
british
naval
base
in
the
mediterranean
would
be
gibraltar
instead
of
malta
conjectures
were
made
as
to
the
significance
of
this
move
it
might
have
meant
that
england
had
found
the
pace
too
great
and
had
deliberately
decided
to
abandon
her
dominance
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
or
that
gibraltar
had
been
secretly
reequipped
as
a
naval
base
what
it
did
mean
was
learned
when
the
french
minister
of
marine
announced
in
the
following
september
that
the
entire
naval
strength
of
france
would
thereafter
be
concentrated
in
the
mediterranean
this
was
the
first
concrete
action
of
the
the
british
navy
in
the
event
of
war
was
to
guard
the
british
home
waters
and
the
northern
ports
of
france
the
french
navy
was
to
guard
the
mediterranean
protecting
french
ports
as
well
as
french
and
british
shipping
from
the
gib
to
the
suez
what
was
the
comparative
strength
of
these
naval
combinations
when
the
war
started
from
her
latest
superdreadnoughts
down
to
her
auxiliary
ships
such
as
those
used
for
hospital
purposes
oil
carrying
and
repairing
england
had
a
total
of
vessels
without
consideration
of
ages
and
types
this
total
means
nothing
and
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
examine
her
naval
strength
in
detail
she
had
nine
battleships
of
tons
displacement
each
built
between
and
the
majestic
prince
george
jupiter
cæsar
mars
illustrious
and
with
engines
developing
horsepower
that
sent
them
through
the
water
at
knots
protected
with
from
nine
to
fourteen
inches
of
armor
and
prepared
to
inflict
damage
on
an
enemy
with
torpedoes
shot
from
under
and
above
the
water
and
with
four
guns
twelve
guns
sixteen
guns
and
twenty
guns
of
smaller
caliber
but
of
quicker
firing
possibilities
her
next
class
was
that
of
the
the
vengeance
ocean
and
tons
lighter
than
the
first
class
named
above
but
more
modern
in
equipment
and
construction
having
been
built
between
the
years
and
their
motive
power
was
heavier
being
horsepower
and
their
speed
was
almost
a
knot
faster
increase
in
the
power
of
naval
guns
had
made
unnecessary
any
increase
in
the
thickness
of
their
armor
and
consequently
ranged
from
to
inches
in
thickness
their
armament
was
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
older
class
but
each
carried
two
more
torpedo
tubes
illustration
german
and
english
naval
positions
discussion
in
naval
circles
throughout
the
world
turned
then
to
the
question
of
whether
it
were
better
to
build
heavier
ships
with
heavier
armament
or
to
build
lighter
and
faster
ships
designed
to
hit
and
get
away
the
british
authorities
inclined
toward
the
former
view
and
between
and
the
british
navy
was
augmented
with
the
london
bulwark
formidable
venerable
queen
and
of
each
of
the
heretofore
displacement
of
tons
in
spite
of
their
size
they
were
comparatively
fast
having
an
average
speed
of
knots
they
did
not
need
and
were
not
equipped
with
heavier
armor
having
plates
as
thin
as
inches
and
as
thick
as
they
were
built
to
take
punishment
and
therefore
they
had
no
greater
armament
than
the
vessels
previously
named
the
naval
program
of
and
also
included
the
albemarle
russell
and
each
tons
lighter
than
the
ships
of
the
type
but
with
the
same
equipment
defensive
and
offensive
and
of
the
same
speed
and
in
the
same
program
as
if
to
offset
the
argument
for
heavier
and
stronger
ships
there
were
included
the
lighter
and
faster
ships
and
displacing
only
tons
but
making
knots
their
speed
permitted
and
necessitated
lighter
armor
inches
through
at
the
thickest
points
and
their
armament
was
also
of
a
lighter
type
for
their
four
largest
guns
were
capable
of
firing
shells
germany
was
becoming
a
naval
rival
worthy
of
notice
and
the
insular
position
of
england
came
to
be
a
matter
of
serious
concern
by
britain
has
never
considered
the
building
of
land
forts
for
her
protection
her
strength
has
always
been
concentrated
in
floating
war
machines
she
now
began
to
build
veritable
floating
forts
ships
of
tons
displacement
by
the
end
of
she
had
ready
to
give
battle
eight
ships
of
this
class
the
edward
vii
commonwealth
dominion
hindustan
africa
hibernia
and
speed
was
not
sacrificed
to
weight
for
they
were
given
a
speed
of
knots
developed
by
engines
of
horsepower
their
thinnest
armor
measured
inches
and
their
heavy
guns
were
protected
with
plates
inches
thick
the
gun
was
still
the
heaviest
piece
of
armament
in
the
british
navy
and
these
eight
ships
each
carried
four
of
that
measurement
as
well
as
four
guns
ten
guns
fourteen
guns
of
inches
two
machine
guns
and
four
torpedo
tubes
now
that
it
was
seen
that
ships
of
enormous
displacement
could
also
be
swift
england
committed
herself
to
the
building
of
ships
of
even
greater
size
in
came
the
first
of
the
modern
dreadnoughts
from
the
name
which
was
given
to
the
original
ship
of
tons
displacement
the
made
the
marvelous
speed
for
a
ship
of
that
size
of
knots
which
she
was
enabled
to
do
with
turbine
engines
of
horsepower
her
armor
measured
from
to
inches
in
thickness
and
her
great
size
enabled
her
to
carry
as
high
as
ten
guns
her
minor
batteries
were
strong
in
proportion
then
as
if
taking
her
breath
after
a
stupendous
effort
england
in
the
following
year
built
two
ships
of
tons
displacement
the
and
the
with
speed
armor
and
armament
much
lower
than
those
of
the
but
having
taken
a
rest
britain
was
again
to
make
a
great
effort
launching
in
the
and
monsters
displacing
tons
with
engines
of
horsepower
that
could
drive
them
through
the
seas
at
knots
ready
to
ward
off
blows
with
armor
from
to
inches
thick
firing
at
the
same
time
volleys
from
ten
guns
down
to
sixteen
rapid
firers
naval
architecture
had
now
taken
a
definite
turn
the
principal
feature
of
which
was
the
tremendous
size
of
the
destructive
floating
machines
england
a
leader
in
this
sort
of
building
in
built
the
and
each
displacing
tons
nor
were
they
lacking
in
speed
for
they
made
on
an
average
knots
the
battleship
was
then
a
matter
of
months
only
and
it
came
in
the
following
year
when
the
and
were
launched
it
was
only
in
the
matter
of
displacement
that
these
three
ships
showed
any
difference
from
those
of
the
class
there
were
no
great
innovations
either
in
armament
or
armor
but
in
the
same
year
there
were
launched
the
monarch
and
each
of
tons
and
equipped
with
armor
from
to
inches
thick
for
the
days
of
armor
on
warships
had
gone
forever
these
had
a
speed
of
knots
and
were
the
first
british
ships
to
have
anything
greater
than
a
gun
they
carried
as
a
primary
battery
ten
guns
and
sixteen
guns
along
with
six
more
of
small
caliber
as
their
secondary
battery
in
and
there
was
only
one
type
of
warship
launched
having
tons
displacement
with
horsepower
a
half
a
knot
faster
than
previous
dreadnoughts
and
carrying
like
the
previous
class
ten
guns
along
with
some
of
smaller
caliber
the
ships
of
this
class
were
the
george
v
ajax
and
the
year
saw
even
more
terrible
machines
of
death
launched
two
types
were
put
into
the
water
the
first
that
of
the
class
of
which
the
other
members
were
the
emperor
of
and
they
showed
great
improvement
in
every
point
their
speed
was
knots
their
displacement
tons
and
their
torpedo
tubes
five
like
their
immediate
predecessors
they
carried
a
primary
battery
of
ten
guns
along
with
the
smaller
ones
and
their
armor
measured
from
to
inches
in
thickness
the
second
type
of
the
year
was
that
of
the
and
class
they
surpassed
all
the
warships
when
they
were
built
their
speed
for
their
size
was
the
greatest
knots
they
had
the
largest
displacement
among
warships
tons
they
had
the
thickest
armor
ranging
from
to
inches
they
had
the
most
improved
form
of
engines
oil
burners
developing
horsepower
and
most
marvelous
of
all
was
their
primary
battery
which
consisted
of
eight
guns
the
largest
gun
yet
made
had
been
the
gun
for
use
in
permanent
position
in
land
forts
and
with
the
german
army
for
a
mobile
force
it
now
was
shown
that
the
modern
warship
could
carry
a
gun
as
heavy
as
any
on
land
there
were
in
the
course
of
construction
when
the
war
broke
out
eight
more
such
monsters
the
and
sister
ships
of
the
and
the
oak
resolution
royal
monarch
and
each
of
tons
displacement
but
having
the
same
armament
as
the
all
of
these
were
hastened
to
completion
as
soon
as
war
was
declared
at
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
war
england
had
in
addition
to
these
greatest
ships
a
number
of
supporting
ships
such
as
the
ten
battle
cruisers
invincible
indefatigable
inflexible
australia
new
zealand
queen
mary
princess
royal
and
the
their
displacements
ranged
from
to
tons
and
their
speeds
from
to
knots
the
last
being
that
of
the
their
speed
is
their
greatest
feature
for
their
armament
and
batteries
are
much
lighter
than
those
of
the
ships
next
there
were
ready
cruisers
of
quite
light
armament
and
armor
there
were
six
of
the
type
four
of
the
type
nine
of
the
same
type
as
the
six
of
the
same
class
as
the
six
like
the
three
of
the
same
class
as
the
together
with
seventeen
heavily
protected
cruisers
of
which
the
was
the
prototype
the
rest
of
the
british
navy
needs
no
detailed
consideration
it
consisted
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
of
protected
light
cruisers
destroyers
and
a
number
of
merchant
ships
convertible
into
war
vessels
together
with
submarines
and
other
small
ships
the
navy
of
france
stood
fourth
in
the
list
of
those
of
the
world
powers
at
the
time
the
war
started
there
were
eighteen
old
vessels
built
between
and
including
the
class
corresponding
to
the
british
ship
the
bouvet
suffren
and
classes
the
most
modern
of
these
types
displaced
no
more
than
tons
made
no
more
than
knots
and
carried
primary
batteries
of
guns
some
improvement
was
made
in
the
six
ships
of
the
class
which
were
built
in
and
they
displaced
tons
had
armor
from
to
inches
thick
and
carried
guns
of
caliber
they
correspond
to
the
british
ship
in
and
were
launched
the
bart
courbet
and
of
the
dreadnought
type
but
much
slower
and
not
so
heavily
armed
as
the
british
ships
of
the
same
class
in
eight
ships
which
were
incomplete
when
war
was
declared
the
matter
of
speed
received
greater
attention
and
they
are
consequently
faster
than
the
older
vessels
of
the
same
type
it
is
in
the
nineteen
french
armored
cruisers
france
has
no
battle
cruisers
that
the
french
showed
better
efforts
as
builders
of
speedy
ships
for
they
made
knots
or
more
in
the
list
of
french
fighting
ships
there
are
in
addition
two
protected
cruisers
the
and
the
together
with
ten
light
cruisers
but
the
french
mosquito
fleet
consisting
of
destroyers
torpedo
boats
and
submarines
is
comparatively
large
of
these
she
had
and
respectively
after
the
war
the
battle
fleets
of
russia
were
entirely
dissipated
so
that
when
the
present
conflict
came
she
had
no
ships
which
might
have
been
accounted
worthy
aids
to
the
navies
of
england
and
france
in
so
far
as
is
known
her
heaviest
ships
were
the
and
the
pavel
each
displacing
only
tons
and
of
the
design
of
against
these
fighting
naval
forces
of
the
allied
powers
were
ranged
the
navies
of
germany
and
the
former
had
at
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
battleships
battle
cruisers
armored
cruisers
and
cruisers
instead
of
giving
attention
to
torpedo
boats
she
gave
it
to
destroyers
of
which
she
had
and
of
submarines
she
had
in
detail
her
naval
forces
consisted
first
of
the
friedrich
iii
kaiser
karl
der
grosse
kaiser
barbarossa
kaiser
wilhelm
and
wilhelm
der
all
built
as
a
result
of
the
first
agitation
of
von
tirpitz
between
the
years
and
they
each
displaced
tons
had
a
speed
of
knots
required
horsepower
were
protected
with
from
to
inches
of
armor
and
carried
four
guns
fourteen
of
inches
twelve
of
and
twenty
of
smaller
measurement
roughly
they
corresponded
to
the
british
ships
of
the
class
both
in
design
and
time
of
launching
following
this
class
came
that
of
the
including
also
the
zähringen
and
built
between

with
from
to
inches
of
armor
and
carrying
a
primary
battery
of
four
guns
eighteen
guns
and
a
large
secondary
battery
the
similar
type
in
the
british
navy
was
the
for
england
was
far
ahead
of
germany
both
in
the
matter
of
displacement
and
primary
battery
during
the
same
years
england
had
launched
ships
of
the
type
of
the
in
came
the
german
ships
and
and
in
and
the
and
they
were
well
behind
the
english
ships
of
the
same
years
for
they
displaced
only
tons
made
knots
carried
armor
of
from
to
inches
in
thickness
and
a
primary
battery
of
four
guns
fourteen
guns
and
twelve
guns
together
with
rapid
firers
and
other
guns
in
a
secondary
battery
england
at
this
time
was
putting
guns
in
the
primary
battery
of
such
ships
as
the
edward
still
germany
kept
up
the
race
and
in
and
launched
the
deutschland
schlesien
and
with
tons
displacement
horsepower
a
speed
of
knots
and
only
guns
in
the
primary
batteries
whereas
england
at
the
same
time
was
building
ships
of
the
dreadnought
type
next
came
four
ships
of
the
class
the
nassau
and
built
in
and
their
heaviest
guns
measured
inches
while
those
of
the
english
ships
of
the
same
class
measured
inches
the
displacement
of
these
german
fighting
ships
was
tons
in
point
of
speed
they
showed
some
improvement
over
the
older
german
ships
making
knots
germany
like
england
was
now
committed
to
the
building
of
larger
and
larger
ships
of
the
line
the
thüringen
and
which
were
put
into
the
water
in
and
were
consequently
of
tons
displacement
with
a
speed
of
knots
and
carrying
twelve
guns
fourteen
guns
fourteen
guns
a
few
smaller
guns
and
as
many
as
six
torpedo
tubes
while
england
was
maintaining
her
two
to
three
policy
and
while
the
united
states
stood
committed
to
the
building
of
two
battleships
a
year
germany
in
put
five
of
them
into
the
water
these
were
the
albert

a
rate
of

displacing
tons
and
carrying
an
armament
of
ten
guns
fourteen
guns
and
a
large
number
of
guns
of
smaller
measurement
their
armor
was
quite
heavy
being
inches
thick
on
the
side
and
inches
thick
where
protection
for
the
big
guns
was
needed
the
largest
ships
in
the
german
navy
which
were
launched
fitted
and
manned
at
the
time
that
the
war
began
were
those
which
were
built
in
and
which
had
a
displacement
of
tons
these
ships
were
the
grosser
and
the
the
corresponding
type
in
the
british
navy
was
that
of
the
built
in
the
same
year
the
british
ships
of
this
class
were
tons
lighter
in
displacement
a
bit
faster
making
knots
to
the
knots
made
by
the
german
ships
and
their
armament
was
not
so
strong
as
that
of
the
german
type
for
the
german
ships
carried
ten
guns
whereas
the
english
carried
ten
guns
in
addition
to
these
battleships
germany
had
certain
others
individual
in
type
such
as
the
der
tann
moltke
goeben
seydlitz
derfflinger
fürst
bismarck
prinz
heinrich
prinz
adalbert
and
and
blücher
magdeburg
strassburg
breslau
stralsund
and
these
may
be
reckoned
as
scout
cruisers
for
they
showed
much
speed
the
fastest
making
knots
and
the
slowest
knots
the
oldest
dates
from
and
the
newest
from
germany
had
also
more
fast
protected
cruisers
which
were
designed
for
scout
duty
in
destroyers
she
was
well
equipped
having
ready
for
service
when
war
was
declared
her
submarines
were
of
the
most
improved
type
and
much
about
their
construction
and
armament
she
was
able
to
keep
secret
from
the
rest
of
the
world
it
is
probable
that
even
their
number
was
greater
than
the
intelligence
departments
of
foreign
navies
suspected
the
best
type
had
a
speed
on
the
surface
of
knots
and
could
travel
at
knots
when
submerged
the
type
known
as
of
the
design
of

in
length
and
had
a

austria
though
not
renowned
for
her
naval
strength
had
certain
units
which
brought
up
the
power
of
the
teutonic
powers
considerably
she
had
nine
battleships
the
karl
erzherzog
ferdinand
max
erzherzog
friedrich
zrinyi
radetzky
erzherzog
franz

teggethoff
prinz
and
these
at
the
time
austria
went
to
war
ranged
in
age
from
nine
years
to
one
year
and
varied
in
displacement
from
tons
to
tons
the
largest
guns
carried
by
any
of
them
measured
inches
and
the
fastest
the
made
knots
of
secondary
importance
were
the
battleships
maria
theresia
kaiser
karl
and
the
register
of
battleships
was
supplemented
with
ten
light
cruisers
of
exceptionally
light
displacement
the
highest
being
only
tons
scouting
was
their
chief
function
austria
had
also
destroyers
torpedo
boats
and
submarines
such
were
the
respective
strengths
of
the
opponents
on
that
day
in
july
when
the
crown
prince
of
lost
his
life
for
ten
years
the
officers
of
the
navy
created
by
the
german
admiral
von
tirpitz
had
at
all
dinners
come
to
their
feet
waved
their
wine
glasses
and
had
given
the
famous
toast
der
tag
to
the
day
on
which
the
english
and
german
naval
hosts
would
sally
forth
to
do
battle
with
each
other
der
tag
found
both
forces
quite
ready
though
the
british
naval
authorities
stole
a
march
on
their
german
rivals
in
the
matter
of
mobilization
it
had
been
the
custom
for
years
in
the
british
navy
to
assemble
the
greater
part
of
the
british
ships
during
the
summer
at
the
port
of
spithead
where
decorated
with
bunting
with
flags
flying
with
visitors
in
holiday
spirit
and
with
officers
and
men
in
smart
dress
the
vessels
were
reviewed
by
the
king
on
the
royal
yacht
but
in
the
eventful
year
of
perhaps
by
accident
perhaps
by
design
for
the
truth
may
never
be
known
the
review
had
a
different
aspect
there
was
no
gaiety
the
number
of
ships
assembled
this
time
was
greater
than
ever
before
actual
fighting
ships
passed
slowly
before
the
royal
yacht
there
were
no
flags
no
bunting
no
holiday
crowds
no
smart
dress
for
officers
and
men
instead
the
fleet
was
drawn
up
ready
for
battle
with
decks
cleared
guns
uncovered
steam
up
and
magazines
replenished
during
the
tense
weeks
in
which
the
war
clouds
gathered
over
southern
europe
this
great
fighting
force
remained
in
the
british
home
waters
and
when
at
fifteen
minutes
after
midnight
on
august
der
tag
had
come
this
fleet
sailed
under
sealed
orders
and
throughout
the
seven
seas
there
were
sundry
ships
flying
the
union
jack
which
immediately
received
orders
by
cable
and
by
wireless
of
the
disposition
of
the
naval
forces
of
germany
less
was
known
her
greatest
strength
was
concentrated
in
the
north
sea
where
the
island
of
helgoland
the
gibraltar
of
the
north
and
the
kiel
canal
with
its
exits
to
the
baltic
and
north
seas
furnished
excellently
both
as
naval
bases
and
impenetrable
protection
throughout
the
rest
of
the
watery
surface
of
the
globe
were
eleven
german
warships
to
which
automatically
fell
the
task
of
protecting
the
thousands
of
ships
which
flying
the
german
red
white
and
black
were
carrying
freight
and
passengers
from
port
to
port
the
first
naval
movements
in
the
great
war
occurred
on
the
morning
of
august
the
british
ship
cut
two
cables
off
the
azores
which
connected
germany
with
north
and
south
america
thus
leaving
these
eleven
german
fighting
ships
without
communication
with
the
german
admiralty
direct
and
the
war
was
not
a
day
old
between
england
and
germany
before
the
german
ship
was
caught
sowing
mines
off
the
eastern
english
ports
by
the
british
destroyer
chapter
xxxiii
first
blood
battle
of
the
bight
the
germans
had
taken
heed
of
the
value
of
mines
from
lessons
learned
at
the
cost
of
russia
in
the
war
with
japan
and
set
about
distributing
these
engines
of
destruction
throughout
the
north
sea
the
british
admiralty
knowing
this
sent
out
it
fleet
of
destroyers
to
scour
home
waters
in
search
of
german
mine
layers
about
ten
on
the
morning
of
august
captain
fox
on
board
the
came
up
with
a
fishing
boat
which
reported
that
it
had
seen
a
boat
throwing
things
overboard
along
the
east
coast
a
flotilla
consisting
of
the
laurel
and
set
out
in
search
of
the
stranger
and
soon
found
her
she
was
the
and
the
things
she
was
casting
overboard
were
mines
the
fired
a
shot
across
her
bow
to
stop
her
but
she
put
on
extra
speed
and
made
an
attempt
to
escape
a
chase
followed
the
gunners
on
the
british
ship
now
fired
to
hit
the
first
of
these
shots
carried
away
the
bridge
of
the
german
ship
a
second
shot
missed
and
a
third
and
fourth
hit
her
hull
six
minutes
after
the
firing
of
the
first
shot
her
stern
was
shot
away
and
she
went
to
the
bottom
bow
up
fifty
of
her
men
were
picked
up
and
brought
to
the
english
shore
the
first
naval
blood
of
the
great
war
had
been
drawn
by
britain
on
august
the
efforts
had
not
been
in
vain
she
had
posthumous
revenge
on
the
morning
of
august
when
the
flagship
of
the
third
flotilla
of
destroyers
hit
one
of
the
mines
which
the
german
ship
had
sowed
it
was
seen
immediately
by
her
officers
that
she
must
sink
three
minutes
after
her
crew
had
left
her
there
came
a
second
explosion
which
throwing
débris
aloft
brought
about
the
death
of
many
of
the
british
sailors
in
the
small
boats
as
well
as
that
of
a
german
prisoner
from
the
all
the
world
with
possibly
the
exception
of
the
men
in
the
german
admiralty
now
looked
for
a
great
decisive
battle
between
the
giants
in
the
north
sea
the
british
spoke
of
it
as
a
coming
second
trafalgar
but
it
was
not
to
take
place
for
reasons
of
their
own
the
germans
kept
their
larger
and
heavier
ships
within
the
protection
of
helgoland
and
the
kiel
canal
but
their
ships
of
smaller
type
immediately
became
active
and
left
german
shores
to
do
what
damage
they
might
to
the
british
navy
it
was
hoped
perhaps
that
the
naval
forces
of
the
two
powers
could
be
equalized
and
a
battle
fought
on
even
terms
after
the
germans
had
cut
down
british
advantage
by
a
policy
of
attrition
a
flotilla
of
german
submarines
on
august
attacked
a
cruiser
belonging
to
the
main
british
fleet
but
was
unable
to
inflict
any
damage
the
lord
mayor
of
the
city
of
birmingham
received
the
following
telegram
the
next
morning
birmingham
will
be
proud
to
learn
that
the
first
german
submarine
destroyed
in
the
war
was
sunk
by
s
two
shots
from
the
british
ship
had
struck
the
german
and
she
sank
immediately
the
german
admiralty
even
before
england
had
declared
war
suspected
that
the
greatest
use
for
the
german
navy
in
the
months
to
come
would
be
to
fight
the
british
navy
but
they
ventured
to
show
their
naval
strength
against
russia
beforehand
early
in
august
they
sent
the
into
the
baltic
sea
to
bombard
the
russian
port
of
libau
but
after
doing
a
good
bit
of
damage
the
german
ship
retired
it
is
probable
that
this
raid
was
nothing
more
than
a
feint
to
remind
russia
that
she
continually
faced
the
danger
of
invasion
from
german
troops
landed
on
the
baltic
shores
under
the
cover
of
german
ships
and
that
she
must
consequently
keep
a
large
force
on
her
northern
shores
instead
of
sending
it
west
to
meet
the
german
army
on
the
border
among
the
german
ships
which
were
separated
from
the
main
fleet
in
the
north
sea
and
which
were
left
without
direct
communication
with
the
german
admiralty
after
the
cutting
of
the
cables
off
the
azores
by
the
were
the
cruisers
and
when
england
declared
war
these
two
german
ships
were
off
the
coast
of
algeria
both
were
very
fast
vessels
having
a
speed
of
knots
and
they
were
designed
to
go
knots
without
needing
replenishment
of
their
coal
bunkers
on
the
morning
of
august
after
having
bombarded
some
of
the
coast
cities
of
algeria
they
found
themselves
cut
off
on
the
east
by
a
french
fleet
and
on
the
west
by
an
english
fleet
but
by
a
very
clever
bit
of
stratagem
they
escaped
the
band
of
the
goeben
was
placed
on
a
raft
and
ordered
on
a
given
moment
to
play
the
german
national
airs
after
an
appreciable
period
meanwhile
under
the
cover
of
the
night
darkness
the
two
german
ships
steamed
away
after
they
had
a
good
start
the
band
on
the
raft
began
to
play
the
british
patrols
heard
the
airs
and
immediately
all
british
ships
were
searching
for
the
source
of
the
music
to
find
a
small
raft
in
was
an
impossible
task
and
while
the
enemy
was
engaged
in
it
the
two
germans
headed
for
messina
then
a
neutral
port
which
they
reached
successfully
the
italian
authorities
permitted
them
to
remain
there
only
hours
before
leaving
they
took
a
dramatic
farewell
which
received
publicity
in
the
press
of
the
whole
world
and
which
was
designed
to
lead
the
british
fleet
commanders
to
believe
that
the
germans
were
coming
out
to
do
battle
instead
they
headed
for
constantinople
they
escaped
all
the
ships
of
the
british
mediterranean
fleet
with
the
exception
of
the
cruiser
with
this
ship
they
exchanged
shots
and
were
in
turn
slightly
damaged
but
they
reached
the
porte
in
seaworthy
condition
and
were
immediately
sold
to
the
turkish
government
which
was
then
still
neutral
the
crews
were
sent
to
germany
and
were
warmly
welcomed
at
berlin
the
officers
responsible
for
their
escape
were
disciplined
by
the
british
authorities
both
germany
and
england
the
former
by
means
of
the
eleven
ships
at
large
and
the
latter
by
means
of
her
preponderance
in
the
number
of
ships
now
made
great
efforts
to
capture
trading
ships
of
the
enemy
when
england
declared
war
there
was
issued
a
royal
proclamation
which
stated
that
up
to
midnight
of
august
england
would
permit
german
merchantmen
in
british
harbors
to
sail
for
home
ports
provided
germany
gave
british
merchantmen
the
same
privilege
but
it
was
specified
that
ships
of
over
tons
would
not
receive
the
privilege
because
they
could
be
converted
into
fighting
ships
afterward
but
on
the
high
seas
enemy
ships
come
upon
were
captured
the
german
admiralty
on
august
had
issued
orders
to
german
merchantmen
to
keep
within
neutral
ports
and
by
this
means
such
important
ships
as
the
der
and
the
eluded
capture
in
the
harbor
of
new
york
was
the
a
fast
steamer
of
knots
she
left
new
york
on
july
carrying
a
cargo
of
in
gold
and
was
on
the
high
seas
when
england
declared
war
naturally
she
was
regarded
by
the
british
as
a
great
prize
and
the
whole
world
awaited
from
day
to
day
the
news
of
her
capture
but
her
captain
showing
great
resourcefulness
after
nearly
reaching
the
british
isles
turned
her
prow
westward
darkened
all
exterior
lights
put
canvas
over
the
port
holes
and
succeeded
in
reaching
bar
harbor
on
the
morning
of
august
similarly
the
and
the
french
liner
leaving
new
york
on
august
were
able
to
elude
the
german
cruiser
which
was
performing
the
difficult
task
of
trying
to
intercept
merchantmen
belonging
to
the
allies
as
they
sailed
from
america
while
she
was
keeping
watch
against
warships
flying
the
flags
still
more
important
was
the
sailing
from
new
york
of
the
german
liner
wilhelm
der
this
ship
had
a
speed
of
knots
and
a
displacement
of
tons
during
the
first
week
of
the
war
she
cleared
the
port
of
new
york
with
what
was
believed
to
be
a
trade
cargo
but
she
so
soon
afterward
began
harassing
british
trading
ships
that
it
was
believed
that
she
left
port
equipped
as
a
vessel
of
war
or
fitted
out
as
one
in
some
other
neutral
port
the
continued
story
of
the
german
raids
on
allied
trading
ships
must
form
a
separate
part
of
this
narrative
it
was
only
a
month
after
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
that
the
fleets
of
the
allied
powers
had
swept
clean
the
seven
seas
of
all
ships
flying
german
and
austrian
flags
which
were
engaged
in
trade
and
not
in
warlike
pursuits
the
first
naval
battle
of
the
great
war
was
fought
on
august
a
certain
liveliness
in
the
north
sea
was
reported
through
the
press
by
the
british
admiralty
on
the
of
august
many
of
the
smaller
vessels
of
the
fleet
of
admiral
von
ingenohl
the
german
commander
such
as
destroyers
light
cruisers
and
scouting
cruisers
were
sighted
shots
between
these
and
english
vessels
of
the
same
types
were
exchanged
at
long
range
but
a
pitched
battle
did
not
come
for
still
a
week
meanwhile
the
british
navy
had
been
doing
its
best
to
destroy
the
mine
fields
established
by
the
germans
trawlers
were
sent
out
in
pairs
dragging
between
them
large
cables
which
cut
the
mines
from
the
moorings
on
being
loosened
they
came
to
the
surface
and
were
destroyed
by
shots
from
the
decks
on
the
of
august
came
the
battle
off
the
bight
of
helgoland
the
island
of
helgoland
had
been
a
british
possession
from
till
when
it
was
transferred
to
germany
by
treaty
it
was
seen
immediately
by
the
germans
that
it
formed
an
excellent
natural
naval
base
lying
as
it
does
miles
northwest
of
cuxhaven
and
miles
north
of
wilhelmshaven
they
at
once
began
to
augment
the
natural
protection
it
afforded
with
their
own
devices
two
zeppelin
sheds
were
erected
concrete
forts
were
built
and
guns
were
installed
the
scene
of
the
battle
which
took
place
here
was
the
bight
of
helgoland
which
formed
a
channel
eighteen
miles
wide
some
seven
miles
north
of
the
island
and
near
which
lay
the
line
of
travel
for
ships
leaving
the
ports
of
the
elbe
british
submarines
which
had
been
doing
reconnaissance
work
on
the
german
coast
since
august
reported
to
the
british
commander
admiral
jellicoe
that
a
large
force
of
german
light
cruisers
and
smaller
craft
were
lying
under
the
protection
of
the
helgoland
guns
and
he
immediately
arranged
plans
for
leading
this
force
away
from
that

the
plans
made
provided
that
three
submarines
were
to
proceed
on
the
surface
of
the
water
to
within
sight
of
the
german
ships
and
when
chased
by
the
latter
were
to
head
westward
the
light

and
were
detailed
to
run
in

german
craft
which
were
to
follow
the
british
submarines
endeavoring
to
cut
them
off
from
the
german
coast
and
these
two
vessels
were
backed
by
a
squadron
of
light
cruisers
held
in
readiness
should
the
first
two
need
assistance
squadrons
of
cruisers
and
battle
cruisers
were
detailed
to
stay
in
the
rear
still
further
to
the
northwest
to
engage
any
german
ships
of
their
own
class
which
might
get
that
far
it
was
at
midnight
on
august
that
commodore
keyes
moved
toward
helgoland
with
eight
submarines
accompanied
by
two
destroyers
during
the
next
day
august
this
force
did
nothing
more
than
keep
watch
for
german
submarines
and
scouting
craft
and
then
took
up
its
allotted
position
for
the
main
action
the
morning
of
the
broke
misty
and
calm
under
half
steam
three
of
the
british
submarines
the
and
steamed
toward
the
island
fortress
showing
their
hulls
above
water
and
followed
by
the
two
detailed
destroyers
the
mist
thickened
still
more
slowly
and
cautiously
went
the
british
submersibles
and
while
they
went
above
water
five
of
their
sister
craft
traveled
under
the
surface
here
was
the
bait
for
the
german
ships
under
helgoland
guns
would
they
bite
the
germans
soon
gave
the
answer
first
there
crept
out
a
german
destroyer
which
took
a
good
look
at
the
situation
and
then
gave
wireless
signals
to
some
twenty
more
of
her
type
which
soon
came
out
to
join
her
the
little
and
speedy
german
boats
bravely
came
out
and
chased
the
two
british
destroyers
and
three
submarines
while
a
german
seaplane
slowly
circled
upward
to
see
if
the
surrounding
regions
harbored
enemies
presumably
the
airman
found
what
he
sought
for
he
soon
flew
back
to
report
to
helgoland
the
peaceful
aspect
of
the
waters
to
the
east
of
the
island
immediately
changed
as
a
squadron
of
light
cruisers
weighed
anchor
and
put
out
after
the
retiring
britishers
before

seven
on
the
morning
of
august
the
positions
of
the
fighting
forces
were
as
follows
the
decoy
british
submarines
were
making
a
track
from
helgoland
to
the
northwest
pursued
by
a
flotilla
of
german
submarines
destroyers
and
torpedo
boats
and
a
fleet
of
light
cruisers
on
the
west
the
left
edge
of
the
page
halfway
up
there
were
the
british
cruisers
and
accompanied
by
flotillas
and
steaming
eastward
at
a
rate
that
brought
them
to
the
rear
of
the
german
squadron
of
light
cruisers
thus
cutting
off
the
latter
from
the
fortress
in
the
southwest
the
lower
corner
of
the

there
was
stationed
a
squadron
of
british
cruisers
ready
to
close
in
when
needed
in
the
northwest
the
upper
corner
of
the
page
there
were
stationed
a
squadron
of
british
light
cruisers
and
another
of
battle
cruisers
and
it
was
toward
these
last
two
units
that
the
decoys
were
leading
the
german
fleets
the
and
felt
the
first
shock
of
battle
on
the
side
of
the
british
the
german
cruiser
closed
with
the
former
while
the
latter
soon
found
itself
very
busy
with
the
german
cruiser
for
minutes
before
the
drew
the
fire
of
the
the
two
german
vessels
poured
a
telling
fire
into
the
and
the
latter
was
soon
in
bad
condition
but
she
managed
to
hold
out
till
succored
by
the
and
then
planted
a
shell
against
the
which
carried
away
her
forebridge
and
killed
her
captain
the
scouting
which
had
been
done
by
the
smaller
craft
of
the
german
fleets
showed
their
commanders
that
there
were
other
british
ships
in
the
neighborhood
besides
the
two
they
had
first
engaged
and
it
was
thought
wiser
to
withdraw
in
face
of
possible
reenforcement
of
the
british
consequently
the
and
turned
eastward
to
seek
the
protection
of
the
fortress
the
a
boat
that
had
been
in
commission
but
a
week
when
the
battle
was
fought
was
in
a
bad
way
all
but
one
of
her
guns
were
out
of
action
her
water
tank
had
been
punctured
and
fire
was
raging
on
her
main
deck
amidships
the
passed
her
a
cable
at
nine
and
towed
her
westward
away
from
the
scene
of
action
while
her
crew
made
what
repairs
they
could
the
flotillas
of
both
sides
had
meanwhile
been
busy
at
the
head
of
the
squadron
of
german
destroyers
that
came
out
of
the
waters
behind
helgoland
was
the
without
slacking
speed
she
steamed
straight
for
the
british
destroyers
her
small
guns
spitting
rapidly
but
she
was
outnumbered
by
british
destroyers
which
poured
such
an
amount
of
steel
into
her
thin
sides
that
she
went
under
her
guns
firing
till
their
muzzles
touched
the
water
and
her
crew
cheering
as
they
went
to
their
deaths
a
few
managed
to
keep
afloat
on
wreckage
and
during
a
lull
in
the
fighting
which
lasted
from
nine
till
ten
boats
were
lowered
from
the
british
destroyers
and
to
pick
up
these
stranded
german
sailors
the
commanders
of
the
german
fleet
perceiving
these
small
boats
from
afar
thought
that
the
british
were
resorting
to
the
old
principle
of
boarding
and
the
german
light
cruiser
came
out
to
fire
upon
them
two
of
the
british
small
boats
had
to
be
abandoned
as
their
mother
ships
made
off
before
the
oncoming
german
they
were
in
a
perilous
position
right
beneath
the
guns
of
the
fortress
but
now
a
daring
and
unique
rescue
took
place
the
commander
of
the
british
submarine
had
been
watching
the
fighting
through
the
periscope
of
his
craft
and
seeing
the
helpless
position
of
the
two
small
boats
he
submerged
made
toward
them
and
then
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
men
in
them
came
up
right
between
them
and
took
their
occupants
aboard
his
boat
repairs
had
been
made
on
the
which
enabled
her
to
go
into
action
again
by
ten
accompanied
again
by
two
light
cruisers
of
ten
guns
and
the
she
turned
westward
in
answer
to
calls
for
assistance
from
the
destroyers
and
which
accompanied
the
submarines
and
which
reported
that
they
were
being
chased
by
fast
german
cruisers
suddenly
the
light
cruiser
again
came
out
of
the
mist
and
bore
down
on
the
british
cruisers
her
larger
guns
were
too
heavy
and
had
too
long
a
range
for
those
of
the
british
craft
and
the
latter
immediately
sent
out
calls
which
brought
into
action
for
the
first
time
certain
ships
belonging
to
the
squadron
of
british
light
cruisers
which
had
been
stationed
to
the
northwest
the
upper
corner
of
the
page
the
vessels
which
answered
the
calls
were
the
light
cruisers
and
with
eight
and
nine
guns
respectively
but
before
arriving
the
still
had
time
to
inflict
more
damage
on
the
the
cruisers
and
joined
the
and
the
british
vessels
were
having
a
bad
time
of
it
when
their
commander
ordered
the
to
concentrate
all
fire
on
the
this
and
a
concentrated
fire
from
the
destroyers
proved
too
strong
for
her
and
she
turned
eastward
disappearing
in
the
mist
off
helgoland
the
then
received
the
attention
of
all
available
british
guns
including
the
battle
cruiser
and
soon
fire
broke
out
within
her
hold
next
her
foremast
slowly
tottering
and
then
inclining
more
and
more
crashed
down
upon
her
deck
a
distorted
mass
following
that
came
down
one
of
her
funnels
the
fire
which
was
raging
aboard
her
was
hampering
her
machinery
and
her
speed
slackened
the
moment
to
strike
with
a
torpedo
had
come
and
one
of
these
steel
fishes
was
sent
against
her
hull
below
water
in
the
explosion
which
followed
one
of
her
boilers
came
out
through
her
deck
ascended
some
fifty
feet
and
dropped
down
near
her
bow
her
engines
stopped
and
she
began
to
settle
slowly
her
bow
going
down
first
it
was
now
noon
from
behind
the
veil
of
the
surrounding
mist
came
the
and
which
with
the
guns
in
their
turrets
completely
finished
the
hapless
and
their
sailors
openly
admired
the
bravery
of
her
crew
which
while
she
sank
maintained
perfect
order
and
sang
the
german
national
air
there
was
yet
the
with
which
the
had
to
do
battle
but
by
now
the
heavy
british
battle
cruisers
and
had
also
come
down
from
the
northwest
to
take
part
in
the
fighting
and
letting
the
escape
from
the
range
of
the
light
cruiser
they
went
for
the
german
which
overpowered
fled
toward
helgoland
while
the
chase
was
on
the
again
made
her
appearance
and
came
to
the
aid
of
the
but
the
light
cruiser
carried
no
gun
as
effective
in
destructive
power
as
the
guns
of
the
and
she
too
had
to
seek
safety
in
flight
the
british
ships
then
finished
the
so
badly
was
she
hit
that
when
the
british
small
boats
sought
the
spot
where
she
quickly
sank
they
found
not
a
man
of
her
crew
afloat
every
man
of
the
of
her
crew
perished
the
afternoon
came
and
with
its
advent
the
mist
which
had
kept
the
guns
of
helgoland
forts
out
of
action
had
cleared
off
the
calm
waters
of
the
north
sea
by
the
time
the
sun
had
set
only

gave
evidence
that
here
brave
men
had
fought
and
died
by
evening
the
respective
forces
were
in
their
home

being
treated
for
their
hurts
the
germans
had
lost

had
limped
home

to
that
of

not

the
loss
on
the
british
side
had
not
entailed
that
of
a
large
ship
but
the
when
she
returned
to
her
home
port
was
far
from
being
in
good
condition
and
some
of
the
smaller
boats
were
in
the

circumstances
admiral
von
ingenohl
was
committed
more
strongly
than
ever
as
a
result
of
this
engagement
to
the
belief
that
the
best
policy
for
his
command
would
be
to
keep
his
squadrons
within
the
protection
afforded
by
helgoland
and
that
the
most
damage
could
be
done
to
the
enemy
by
picking
off
her
larger
ships

by
one

was
only
two
days
later
that
the

was
made
the
true
target
of
a
torpedo
fired
by
a
german
submarine
off
the
british
eastern
coast
and
she
too
went
to

its
mark

the
joined

up
to
this
point
the
results
of

were
even
but
the
germans
scored
heavily
during
the
following
week
on

the
three
slow
british
cruisers
and
were
patrolling
the
waters
off

were
the
battleships
and
completed
in
and
displacing
tons
their
heavy
guns
measured
inches
and
they
made
a
speed
of
knots
there
were
also
the
vessels
and
individual
in
type
with
corresponding
kinds
in
no
other
navy
and
which
might
be
called
a
cross
between
an
armored
cruiser
and
battle
cruiser
though
displacing
no
more
than
tons
they
carried
four
guns
and
made
the
comparatively
low
speed
of
knots
in
and
the
japanese
added
two
more
ships
of
this
kind
to
their
navy
the
and
slightly
heavier
and
faster
and
with
the
same
armament
the
dreadnought
also
came
in
a
vessel
displacing
tons
but
making
a
speed
of
only
knots
and
with
an
extraordinarily
heavy
main
battery
consisting
of
four
guns
and
twelve
guns
the
launched
in
was
tons
heavier
than
the
and
was
more
than
knots
faster
and
her
main
battery
was
equally
strong
the
dreadnoughts
and
completed
in
and
respectively
displaced
tons
but
were
able
to
make
not
more
than
knots
at
this
time
the
japanese
admiralty
perhaps
on
account
of
lessons
learned
in
the
war
with
russia
was
building
dreadnoughts
with
less
speed
than
those
in
the
other
navies
but
with
much
heavier
main
batteries
these
two
vessels
carried
a
unique
main
battery
of
twelve
guns
along
with
others
of
smaller
measurement
what
the
dreadnoughts
lacked
in
speed
was
made
up
in
that
of
four
battle
cruisers
launched
after
these
were
the
kongo
and
with
the
good
speed
of
knots
their
displacement
was
tons
and
they
carried
in
their
primary
batteries
eight
guns
and
sixteen
guns
at
the
time
japan
entered
the
war
she
had
in
building
four
superdreadnoughts
with
the
tremendous
displacement
of
tons
these
vessels
the
yukosaka
and
had
been
designed
to
carry
a
main
battery
of
the
strength
of
the
and
to
have
a
speed
of
knots
the
first
move
of
the
japanese
navy
in
the
great
war
was
to
cooperate
with
the
army
in
besieging
the
german
town
of
kiaochaw
on
the
shantung
peninsula
in
china
but
the
operation
was
soon
more
military
than
naval
japanese
warships
captured
bonham
island
in
the
group
known
as
the
marshall
islands
and
having
cleared
eastern
waters
of
german
warships
scoured
the
pacific
in
such
a
manner
as
to
chase
those
which
escaped
into
the
regions
patrolled
by
the
british
navy
the
german
vessels
which
made
their
escape
were
among
the
eleven
which
were
separated
from
the
rest
of
germany
navy
in
the
north
sea
at
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
they
were
with
the
exception
of
the
the
nürnberg
and
it
was
weeks
before
they
were
first
reported
on
september
at
the
harbor
of
papeete
where
they
destroyed
the
french
gunboat
and
after
putting
again
to
sea
their
location
was
once
more
a
mystery
on
the
evening
of
november
a
british
squadron
consisting
of
the
vessels
hope
otranto
and
all
except
the
coming
through
the
straits
sighted
the
enemy
the
british
ships
lined
up
abreast
and
proceeded
in
a
northeasterly
direction
the
germans
took
up
the
same
alignment
eight
miles
to
the
westward
of
the
british
ships
and
proceeded
southward
at
full
speed
both
forces
opened
fire
at
a
distance
of
yards
shortly
after
six
off
coronel
near
the
coast
of
chile
the
was
struck
by
a
shot
from
the
the
and
picked
the
as
their
first
target
but
finding
that
they
could
do
no
damage
at
that
range
and
that
they
were
safe
from
the
fire
of
the
british
ship
they
came
to
within
yards
of
her
her
fire
in
reply
was
augmented
by
that
of
the
excellent
aim
on
the
part
of
the
germans
soon
had
the
out
of
action
and
fire
broke
out
aboard
her
soon
after
general
action
her
magazine
exploded
the
then
received
the
brunt
of
the
fire
from
the
german
ships
and
came
in
for
more
than
her
share
of
the
destructive
fire
being
put
virtually
out
of
action
and
at
the
same
time
there
occurred
an
explosion
on
board
the
and
she
sank
immediately
carrying
admiral
cradock
to
his
death
there
remained
of
the
british
force
only
the
a
converted
liner
and
not
really
a
battleship
of
the
line
the
and
the
hopelessly
disabled
to
continue
the
fight
with
an
efficient
german
force
the
british
commander
ordered
the
former
two
to
get
away
by
making
speed
but
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
paying
no
heed
to
the
order
kept
in
the
fight
dusk
was
then
coming
on
and
the
sought
to
take
advantage
of
it
by
getting
between
the
german
ships
and
the
limping
concealing
the
latter
from
them
with
her
smoke
but
the
germans
had
now
come
to
within
yards
to
escape
possible
attack
from
torpedoes
the
german
ships
spread
out
their
line
but
perceiving
that
such
a
danger
was
not
present
they
again
closed
in
to
finish
the
crippled
british
ships
all
of
the
german
ships
now
went
for
the
and
she
had
to
desert
the
which
first
sailed
northward
in
bad
condition
and
later
made
an
attempt
to
run
ashore
at
santa
maria
but
was
unable
to
do
so
the
inevitable
if
played
its
part
in
the
battle
when
the
british
fleet
first
went
after
the
germans
it
had
as
one
of
its
units
the
battleship
but
her
speed
was
not
up
to
that
of
the
other
ships
and
she
fell
far
to
their
stern
by
the
time
the
action
was
on
she
was
too
distant
to
take
part
in
it
no
attempt
was
made
to
go
together
owing
to
the
slowness
of
the
battleship
the
was
never
in
the
action
at
all
being
miles
astern
had
cradock
not
desired
to
he
need
not
have
taken
on
the
action
but
retired
in
the
the
setting
of
the
sun
also
played
its
part
if
daylight
had
continued
some
hours
more
the
british
squadron
might
have
held
out
till
the
brought
up
for
the
almost
horizontal
rays
of
the
sun
were
in
the
eyes
of
the
german
gunners
but
as
it
dropped
below
the
watery
horizon
it
left
the
british
ships
silhouetted
against
a
clear
outline
the
did
not
get
into
the
fight
and
the
greatest
concern
of
the
as
she
steamed
off
was
to
warn
the
british
battleship
to
keep
off
for
of
less
speed
than
the
german
ships
and
outnumbered
by
them
her
appearance
meant
her
destruction
the
later
joined
by
the
arrived
in
battered
condition
at
the
falkland
islands
the
after
the
main
action
was
over
was
found
and
finished
by
the
german
squadron
and
went
down
seventy
shots
were
fired
at
her
when
she
lay
sinking
on
fire
and
helpless
and
unable
to
fire
her
guns
germany
had
evened
the
score
in
the
second
battle
between
fleets
the
after
the
falkland
action
took
refuge
in
fiordes
of
terra
del
fuego
and
after
being
there
for
a
couple
of
months
proceeded
to
the
head
of
the
island
of
juan
fernandez
where
she
was
found
by
the
and
auxiliary
cruiser
and
was
destroyed
most
remarkable
had
been
the
career
of
the
german
cruiser
which
had
joined
the
other
german
ships
that
went
to
make
up
the
german
squadron
which
fought
in
this
battle
off
coronel
this
vessel
on
the
day
after
germany
and
england
went
to
war
was
lying
near
yap
an
island
in
the
pacific
that
had
been
until
captured
by
the
japanese
the
wireless
station
of
most
importance
to
the
germans
in
the
pacific
ocean
she
immediately
after
being
apprised
that
she
was
part
of
a
navy
engaged
in
a
war
set
sail
and
was
not
reported
again
until
the
of
september
when
she
appeared
at
fanning
island
a
cable
station
maintained
by
britain
and
from
which
cables
run
to
vancouver
to
the
east
and
australia
to
the
west
here
she
performed
a
clever
bit
of
work
by
entering
the
harbor
flying
the
tricolor
of
france
and
appearing
as
though
she
was
making
a
friendly
visit
officials
on
the
island
happy
to
think
they
would
have
such
a
visitor
saw
two
cutters
leave
the
warship
great
was
the
surprise
of
those
watching
events
from
the
shore
when
they
saw
the
french
flag
lowered
from
the
masthead
of
the
visitor
and
in
its
place
the
german
naval
ensign
run
up
the
cutters
were
just
about
reaching
water
at
the
shore
when
this
surprise
came
and
it
was
augmented
when
with
the
protection
of
the
guns
of
the
vessel
the
men
in
these
cutters
showed
themselves
to
be
a
hostile
landing
party
her
presence
was
not
reported
to
the
rest
of
the
world
for
the
good
reason
that
she
cut
all
cables
leading
from
the
island
all
the
british
men
there
were
put
under
guard
and
after
damaging
all
cable
instruments
she
could
find
the
accompanied
by
a
collier
that
had
come
with
her
again
took
to
the
high
seas
she
next
turned
up
at
the
island
of
felix
miles
west
of
the
chilean
coast
but
did
not
come
to
the
harbor
during
the
night
of
october
the
inhabitants
of
that
island
saw
the
flash
and
heard
the
roar
of
an
explosion
miles
out
to
sea
and
for
a
number
of
days
later
they
picked
up
on
their
beach
the
wreckage
of
what
must
have
been
a
collier
as
has
been
related
in
preceding
paragraphs
the
took
part
in
that
fight
the
end
of
her
career
came
in
the
battle
off
the
falkland
islands
which
will
be
dealt
with
later
chapter
xxxv
the
german
sea
raiders
while
british
were
capturing
german
and
taking
them
to
british
ports
the
german
raiders
which
were
abroad
were
earning
terrifying
reputations
for
themselves
because
the
enemy
merchantmen
with
which
they
came
upon
had
to
be
destroyed
on
the
high
seas
for
there
were
no
ports
to
which
they
could
be
taken
prominent
among
these
was
the
a
cruiser
when
the
war
came
she
was
in
asiatic
waters
and
immediately
made
the
east
coast
of
africa
her
beat
while
patrolling
it
she
came
upon
two
british
merchant
ships
and
after
taking
from
their
stores
such
supplies
as
were
needed
she
sent
them
to
the
bottom
on
september
she
made
a
dash
into
the
harbor
of
zanzibar
and
found
there
the
british
cruiser
which
on
account
of
her
age
was
undergoing
a
complete
overhauling
she
was
easy
prey
for
the
german
ship
for
besides
the
fact
that
she
was
stationary
her
guns
were
of
shorter
range
than
those
of
her
adversary
shell
after
shell
tore
into
her
till
she
was
battered
beyond
all
resemblance
to
a
fighting
craft
but
her
flag
flew
till
the
end
for
though
it
was
shot
down
from
the
masthead
two
marines
held
it
aloft
one
of
them
losing
his
life
and
when
the
her
task
of
destruction
complete
sailed
off
the
lone
marine
still
held
up
the
union
jack
the
british
ships
in
those
waters
made
a
systematic
hunt
for
her
and
located
her
at
last
on
the
of
october
she
was
hiding
in
her
favorite
rendezvous
some
miles
up
the
rufigi
river
in
german
east
africa
the
ship
which
found
her
was
the
a
cruiser
with
a
draft
much
heavier
than
that
of
the
and
the
difference
gave
the
latter
a
good
advantage
for
she
ran
up
the
river
and
her
enemy
could
not
follow
nor
could
the
english
ship
use
her
guns
with
much
effect
for
the
gunners
could
not
make
out
the
hull
of
the
german
ship
through
the
tropical
vegetation
along
the
river
banks
all
that
the
british
ship
could
do
was
to
fire
shells
in
her
general
direction
and
then
guess
what
effect
they
had
but
to
prevent
her
escape
colliers
were
sunk
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
she
had
come
to
as
inglorious
an
end
as
her
victim
the
the
account
of
another
raider
the
which
left
new
york
on
the
evening
that
england
declared
war
with
her
bunkers
loaded
with
coal
and
other
supplies
for
warships
has
already
been
related
the
mystery
concerning
this
sailing
was
cleared
up
when
she
was
caught
coaling
the
in
the
atlantic
both
ships
made
off
in
safety
that
time
and
soon
after
a
british
cruiser
reported
that
she
had
been
heard
in
wireless
communication
with
the
thereafter
the
fate
of
this
ship
remained
a
mystery
till
she
put
in
at
hampton
roads
on
april
most
spectacular
was
the
career
of
the
a
cruiser
which
sailed
from
japanese
waters
at
the
same
time
as
the
through
the
ability
of
her
commander
captain
karl
von
müller
she
earned
the
soubriquet
terror
of
the
east
for
by
using
a
clever
system
of
supply
ships
she
was
able
to
raid
eastern
waters
for
ten
weeks
without
making
a
port
or
otherwise
running
the
risk
of
leaving
a
clue
by
which
british
ships
might
find
her
her
favorite
occupation
was
that
of
stopping
enemy
merchantmen
which
she
sank
but
her
captain
always
allowed
one
the
last
one
of
her
prizes
to
remain
afloat
and
in
this
he
sent
to
the
nearest
port
the
officers
passengers
and
crews
of
those
that
were
destroyed
at
times
he
used
prizes
as
colliers
putting
them
under
command
of
his
petty
officers
by
way
of
diversion
captain
von
müller
steamed
into
the
harbor
of
madras
in
the
bay
of
bengal
and
opened
with
his
guns
on
the
suburbs
of
the
town
setting
on
fire
two
huge
oil
tanks
there
the
fort
there
returned
the
fire
but
the
after
half
an
hour
sailed
away
unharmed
she
had
been
enabled
to
come
near
the
british
guns
on
shore
by
flying
the
french
flag
which
she
continued
to
display
until
her
guns
began
to
boom
she
then
left
the
waters
of
bengal
bay
but
not
before
she
had
ended
the
journey
of
worth
of
exports
to
india
and
had
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
some
worth
of
imports
steamers
had
been
her
victims
their
total
value
having
been
about
and
their
cargoes
were
worth
at
least
very
expensive
the
british
found
her
and
they
were
willing
to
go
to
any
length
to
end
her
career
they
curtailed
her
activities
somewhat
when
the
captured
the
converted
liner
which
was
one
of
her
colliers
and
recaptured
the
greek
freighter
which
had
been
doing
the
same
duty
this
took
place
off
the
coast
of
sumatra
but
von
müller
was
undaunted
even
though
his
coal
problem
was
becoming
serious
he
knew
that
the
had
sailed
from
penang
near
malacca
and
that
she
was
not
at
that
base
since
she
was
searching
for
his
own
vessel
he
therefore
conceived
the
daring
exploit
of
making
a
visit
to
penang
while
the
was
still
away
he
came
within
ten
miles
of
the
harbor
on
the
of
october
and
disguised
his
ship
by
erecting
a
false
funnel
made
of
canvas
upheld
by
a
wooden
frame
much
like
theatrical
scenery
this
gave
the
four
funnels
such
as
the
carried
coming
into
the
harbor
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
she
was
taken
by
those
on
shore
to
be
the
british
ship
not
a
hostile
gun
ready
for
her
lying
in
the
harbor
was
the
russian
cruiser
and
three
french
destroyers
and
a
gunboat
the
watch
on
the
russian
ship
questioned
her
and
was
told
by
the
wireless
operator
on
the
that
she
was
the
returning
to
anchor
by
this
ruse
the
german
ship
was
enabled
to
come
within
yards
of
the
russian
ship
before
the
false
funnel
was
discovered
fire
immediately
spurted
from
the
russian
guns
but
a
torpedo
from
the
struck
the
engine
room
and
made
it
impossible
for
her
crew
to
get
ammunition
to
her
guns
von
müller
poured
steel
into
her
from
a
distance
of
yards
with
terrible
effect
the
russian
ship
list
put
many
of
her
guns
out
of
action
and
she
was
unable
to
deliver
an
effective
reply
another
torpedo
from
the
exploded
her
magazine
fifteen
minutes
after
the
firing
of
the
first
shot
the
russian
had
gone
to
the
bottom
von
müller
now
put
the
prow
of
the
to
sea
again
for
he
feared
that
both
the
and
the
french
cruiser
had
by
then
been
summoned
by
wireless
luck
was
with
him
half
an
hour
after
leaving
the
harbor
he
sighted
a
ship
flying
a
red
flag
which
showed
him
at
once
that
she
was
carrying
a
cargo
of
powder
he
badly
needed
the
ammunition
and
he
prepared
to
capture
her
but
this
operation
was
interrupted
by
a
mirage
which
caused
the
small
french
destroyer
to
appear
like
a
huge
battleship
when
he
discovered
the
truth
von
müller
closed
with
the
frenchman
who
came
to
the
rescue
of
the
the
powder
ship
destroyer
and
cruiser
closed
for
a
fight
the
former
trying
to
get
close
enough
to
make
work
with
torpedoes
possible
but
the
long
range
of
the
guns
prevented
this
and
the
was
badly
damaged
by
having
her
engine
room
hit
soon
she
was
in
a
bad
way
and
von
müller
ordered
his
guns
silenced
thinking
the
destroyer
would
now
give
up
the
fight
but
the
frenchman
was
valiant
and
refused
to
do
so
he
let
go
with
two
torpedoes
which
did
not
find
their
mark
and
was
immediately
subjected
to
a
withering
fire
which
caused
his
ship
to
sink
bow
first
one
of
the
destroyers
which
had
been
in
the
harbor
now
came
out
to
take
issue
with
the
but
it
was
the
business
of
the
latter
to
continue
destroying
merchant
ships
and
not
to
run
the
risk
of
having
her
career
ended
by
a
warship
so
she
immediately
put
off
for
the
indian
ocean
a
storm
which
then
came
up
permitted
her
to
make
a
better
escape
it
was
not
until
the
of
november
that
the
world
at
large
heard
more
of
her
and
it
proved
to
be
the
last
day
of
her
reign
of
terror
there
was
a
british
wireless
and
cable
station
on
the
cocos
keeling
isles
southwest
of
java
and
von
müller
had
determined
to
interrupt
the
communication
maintained
there
connecting
india
australia
and
south
africa
forty
men
and
three
officers
with
three
machine
guns
were
detailed
by
him
as
a
landing
party
to
destroy
instruments
and
cut
the
cables
but
such
a
thing
had
been
partially
forestalled
by
the
british
authorities
who
had
set
up
false
cable
ends
these
were
destroyed
by
the
deceived
germans
when
the
had
first
made
her
appearance
the
news
had
been
sent
out
by
the
wireless
operator
on
shore
not
knowing
what
ships
would
pick
up
his
calls
this
time
luck
was
against
von
müller
for
it
so
happened
that
a
convoy
of
troop
ships
from
australia
was
passing
within
one
hundred
miles
they
were
accompanied
by
the
australian
cruisers
and
the
latter
was
dispatched
to
go
to
the
cocos
islands
and
by
getting
up
a
speed
of
knots
she
reached
them
in
less
than
three
hours
von
müller
knew
that
escape
by
flight
was
impossible
for
his
ship
had
been
weeks
at
sea
her
boilers
were
crusted
her
machinery
badly
in
need
of
repair
and
she
had
not
too
much
coal
he
therefore
decided
to
give
battle
and
went
straight
for
the
at
full
speed
his
object
was
to
meet
her
on
even
terms
for
her
advantage
was
that
her
guns
had
much
greater
range
than
those
of
the
if
he
could
get
close
enough
he
might
be
able
to
use
his
torpedo
tubes
but
captain
glossop
of
the
saw
through
this
maneuver
and
maintained
good
distance
between
the
two
ships
about
the
first
shot
from
the
killed
the
man
at
the
range
finder
on
the
fore
bridge
of
the
captain
glossop
was
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
him
at
the
time
the
replies
from
the
australian
ship
were
fatal
the
foremost
funnel
of
the
crumpled
and
fell
her
fire
almost
ceased
and
then
she
began
to
burn
the
second
funnel
and
the
third
fell
also
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
beach
her
which
von
müller
did
just
before
noon
while
she
lay
there
helpless
the
shot
more
steel
into
her
leaving
her
quite
helpless
and
then
went
off
to
chase
a
merchant
ship
which
had
been
sighted
during
the
fighting
and
which
when
caught
proved
to
be
the
british
ship
now
manned
by
germans
and
doing
duty
as
collier
to
the
returning
to
the
latter
captain
glossop
saw
that
she
still
flew
the
german
flag
at
her
masthead
he
signaled
her
asking
whether
she
would
surrender
but
receiving
no
reply
after
waiting
five
minutes
he
let
her
have
a
few
more
salvos
the
german
flag
came
down
and
the
white
flag
went
up
in
its
place
the
had
been
avenged
and
the
terribly
costly
career
of
the
brought
to
an
end
von
müller
was
taken
prisoner
and
on
account
of
his
valor
was
permitted
to
keep
his
sword
but
the
landing
party
which
had
cut
the
false
cables
was
still
at
large
the
adventures
of
these
three
officers
and
forty
men
form
a
separate
story
which
will
be
narrated
later
chapter
xxxvi
battle
off
the
falklands
the
defeat
of
the
british
squadron
back
in
the
first
week
of
november
had
sorely
tried
the
patience
of
the
british
public
and
the
admiralty
felt
the
necessity
of
retrieving
faith
in
the
navy
von
spee
was
still
master
of
the
waters
near
the
horn
and
till
his
ships
had
again
been
met
the
british
could
not
boast
of
being
rulers
of
the
waves
consequently
admiral
fisher
detailed
the
two
battle
cruisers
and
to
go
to
the
falkland
islands
they
left
england
november
and
on
the
outward
journey
met
with
and
took
along
the
light
cruisers
and
the
cruiser
and
the
converted
liner
the
and
the
now
repaired
all
joined
the
squadron
which
was
commanded
by
admiral
sturdee
the
vessels
coaled
at
stanley
falkland
islands
and
while
so
engaged
on
december
were
warned
by
a
civilian
volunteer
watcher
on
a
hill
that
two
strange
vessels
had
made
their
appearance
in
the
distance
british
naval
officers
identified
them
and
other
vessels
which
were
coming
into
view
as
the
ships
of
von
squadron
the
one
which
had
been
victorious
off
coronel
during
the
interval
that
had
elapsed
since
that
engagement
these
german
ships
had
not
been
idle
von
spee
knew
that
the
had
gone
to
the
falklands
and
that
there
were
important
wireless
stations
there
but
he
put
off
going
after
those
prizes
and
picked
up
others
the
had
cut
communication
between
banfield
and
fanning
islands
two
british
trading
ships
had
fallen
victims
to
the
and
four
more
had
met
the
same
end
at
the
hands
of
the
for
coal
and
other
supplies
von
spee
had
been
relying
on
the
chilean
ports
but
now
came
trouble
between
him
and
the
port
authorities
for
england
was
accusing
the
south
american
nation
of
acting
without
regard
to
neutrality
it
was
for
this
reason
that
von
spee
turned
southward
to
take
the
falkland
islands
the
world
at
large
and
of
course
von
spee
had
no
knowledge
of
the
ships
which
had
set
out
from
plymouth
for
the
falklands
on
the
eleventh
of
the
month
so
he
approached
in
full
expectation
of
making
not
only
a
raid
but
for
occupation
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
exchange
shots
with
the
and
perhaps
some
small
ships
and
he
believed
the
islands
weakly
defended
by
forts
but
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
defer
his
attack
the
result
the
lookout
near
stanley
had
reported
the
oncoming
warships
and
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
german
squadron
german
guns
were
trained
on
the
wireless
station
and
great
was
the
surprise
of
the
unfortunate
von
spee
and
his
officers
when
there
was
heard
the
booming
of
guns
which
they
knew
immediately
must
be
mounted
on
warships
larger
than
their
own
their
scouting
had
been
defective
and
the
presence
of
the
and
had
till
then
not
been
discovered
they
then
reasoned
that
these
were
the
guns
of
the
a
critical
and
fatal
error
the
from
behind
the
hills
fired
on
the
german
ships
in
an
endeavor
to
protect
the
wireless
station
beyond
the
range
of
her
guns
hovered
the
lighter
german
cruisers
and
to
await
the
outcoming
of
the
both
the
and
concentrated
their
fire
on
the
and
when
the
accompanied
by
the
and
made
her
appearance
it
did
not
change
the
battle
formation
of
the
germans
for
the
was
still
the
only
large
vessel
they
were
aware
of
now
the
came
nearer
in
order
to
take
up
the
fight
with
the
lighter
british
ships
by
nine
in
the
morning
the
german
ships
were
drawn
out
in
single
file
running
parallel
with
the
shore
in
a
northeasterly
direction
at
the
head
of
the
line
was
the
followed
by
the
scharnhorst
and
in
that
order
they
thought
that
this
would
entice
what
they
believed
to
be
the
whole
of
the
british
force
present
into
coming
out
for
a
running
fight
and
in
which
the
old
would
be
left
behind
to
be
finished
after
the
lighter
vessels
were
done
for
but
all
this
time
the
and
were
silent
with
their
guns
though
there
was
bustle
enough
aboard
them
while
their
coaling
was
being
hurried
by
ten
these
two
larger
ships
were
ready
with
steam
up
and
decks
cleared
and
they
came
out
from
behind
the
hills
von
spee
saw
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
and
gave
orders
for
his
ships
to
make
off
at
full
speed
for
a
time
the
two
squadrons
kept
parallel
to
each
other
at
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
with
the
british
squadron
the
and
leading
north
of
the
german
ships
the
and
two
transports
that
had
been
part
of
the
german
squadron
were
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
others
and
headed
south
pursued
by
the
and
the
two
british
battle
cruisers
were
faster
than
any
other
ships
in
either
squadron
and
while
pulling
up
on
the
german
ships
were
in
danger
of
pulling
away
from
their
own
ships
to
avoid
the
latter
admiral
sturdee
kept
down
their
speed
and
was
content
with
taking
a
little
longer
to
get
within
gun
range
of
von
spee
ships
by
two
the
distance
between
them
was
about
yards
the
and
had
now
left
the
rest
of
the
british
squadron
far
behind
and
took
issue
with
the
and
respectively
the
remaining
british
ships
with
the
exception
of
the
gave
attention
to
the
three
lighter
german
cruisers
and
the
which
had
broken
from
the
first
formation
and
were
now
pointing
southeast
von
spee
ordered
the
and
to
turn
broadside
to
the
enemy
shells
were
falling
upon
the
german
ships
with
fair
accuracy
but
their
return
fire
could
do
little
damage
to
the
british
ships
because
the
range
was
a
little
too
great
for
the
german
guns
those
of
the
and
were
of
the
type
all
four
ships
were
belching
forth
heavy
black
smoke
that
hung
low
over
the
water
after
it
left
the
funnels
a
moderate
breeze
carried
it
northward
and
von
spee
moved
his
ships
this
way
and
that
till
his
smoke
blew
straight
against
the
guns
of
the
british
ships
making
it
almost
impossible
for
the
british
gunners
to
take
aim
and
note
effect
but
the
superior
speed
of
the
two
british
battle
cruisers
stood
them
in
good
stead
and
their
commanders
brought
them
up
south
of
the
enemy
on
their
other
side
it
was
now
the
german
gunners
who
found
the
smoke
in
their
faces
and
the
advantage
was
with
the
british
by
three
in
the
afternoon
fire
had
broken
out
on
the
and
von
spee
replied
to
sturdee
inquiry
that
he
would
not
quit
fighting
though
some
of
his
guns
were
out
of
action
and
those
which
still
replied
to
the
britisher
did
now
only
at
intervals
there
was
evidently
something
wrong
with
the
machinery
that
brought
shells
and
ammunition
to
her
guns
from
out
of
her
hold
the
fire
probably
interfering
with
it
a
shell
cut
right
through
her
third
funnel
and
carried
it
completely
off
the
ship
she
turned
so
that
she
could
bring
her
starboard
guns
into
action
and
they
did
so
feebly
the
fire
on
board
her
grew
worse
and
worse
and
it
could
be
seen
through
holes
made
by
the
shells
from
the
whenever
her
hull
showed
through
the
dense
clouds
of
escaping
steam
that
enveloped
her
just
at
four
she
began
to
list
to
port
thus
having
her
starboard
guns
put
out
of
action
for
they
pointed
toward
the
sky
and
the
shells
which
came
from
them
described
parabolas
dropping
into
the
water
at
safe
distance
from
the
english
ship
more
and
more
she
listed
till
her
port
beam
ends
were
in
the
cold
waters
of
the
south
atlantic
and
while
in
that
position
she
sank
some
fifteen
minutes
later
meanwhile
the
duel
between
the
and
had
been
going
on
a
shell
from
one
of
the
british
cruisers
struck
one
of
the
after
gun
turrets
of
the
and
swept
it
overboard
the
german
ship
used
the
sinking
as
a
screen
and
tried
to
take
on
both
british
ships
still
she
was
able
to
plant
some
effective
shells
against
the
as
a
final
reply
by
five
she
was
listing
heavily
to
starboard
and
her
engines
had
stopped
the
british
ship
thinking
she
was
surely
done
for
ceased
firing
at
her
and
watched
her
for
ten
minutes
while
a
single
gun
on
board
of
her
fired
at
intervals
the
three
ships
and
now
closed
in
on
her
and
punished
her
till
the
flag
at
her
stern
was
hauled
down
but
the
ensign
at
her
peak
continued
to
fly
just
at
six
with
this
color
still
in
position
she
suddenly
heeled
to
starboard
while
the
men
of
her
crew
made
hastily
up
her
slanting
decks
and
then
climbed
over
on
to
the
exposed
part
of
her
upturned
port
side
many
of
these
unfortunate
men
had
time
to
jump
into
the
sea
but
others
were
caught
when
she
suddenly
disappeared
beneath
the
surface
there
remained
the
task
of
picking
up
her
survivors
but
they
were
not
numerous
for
the
shock
of
the
cold
water
killed
a
large
number
having
picked
up
those
whom
they
could
the
three
british
ships
signaled
the
news
of
their
victories
to
the
distant
cruisers
which
were
fighting
it
out
with
the
leipzig
and
these
lighter
german
cruisers
had
left
the
line
of
battle
and
had
turned
southward

just
about
the
time
that
the

up

at
three
began
to
fire
on
the
at
a
distance
of
yards
as
in
the
other
action
of
that
afternoon
the
british
ship
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
her
guns
had
longer
range
and
she
drew
back
from
the
german
ships
so
that
their
guns
could
not
reach
her
though
her
own
shells
began
to
fall
upon
their
decks
it
was
her
object
to
keep
them
busy
until

her
in
bad
condition
and
the
came
up
to
assist
in
raking
her
till
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
mass
of
wreckage
on
her
decks
but
her
flag
was
still
flying
and
the
british
ships
kept
circling
around
her
thinking
she
still
wished
to
fight
but
not
coming
near
enough
to
permit
the
use
of
her
torpedo
tubes
miserable
was
the
plight
of
the
crew
for
the
two
hundred
men
who
were
still
alive
were
unable
to
get
to
her
flag
on
account
of
the
fire
aboard
her
and
they
had
to
remain
inactive
while
the
and
poured
round
after
round
into
their
ship
only
twelve
remained
alive
at
nine
when
she
began
to
list
to
port
slowly
more
and
more
of
the
part
of
her
hull
showed
above
the
sea
and
she
continued
to
heel
until
her
keel
was
right
side
up
in
this
position
she
sank
a
large
bubble
marking
the
spot
when
the
left
the
line
of
german
ships
at
one
it
was
the
british
cruiser
that
went
after
her
a
vessel
more
heavily
armed
than
the
german
ship
yet
about
a
knot
slower
but
by
hard
work
on
the
part
of
the
engineers
and
stokers
of
the
she
was
able
by
five
to
get
within
firing
distance
of
the

a
strange
trick
of
fate
the

sister
ship
to
the
which
had
fallen
victim
to
one
of
the
torpedoes
in
the
battle
off

here
too
was
a
duel
with
human
interest
in
it
in
their
desire
for
revenge
the
men
of
the

fuel
of
even
her
furniture
in
order
to
speed
up
her
engines
her
guns
now
began
to
strike
the
german
ship
and
soon
a
fire
broke
out
aboard
her
she
could
have
ended
the
german
vessel
by
keeping
a
fire
upon
her
while
remaining
too
distant
to
be
within
range
of
the
guns
but
dusk
was
gathering
and
an
evening
mist
was
settling
down
upon
the
water
consequently
the
drew
nearer
to
her
adversary
the
firing
of
the
was
then
effective
and
more
than
twenty
of
her
shells
took
good
effect
on
the
british
ship
it
was
only
through
prompt
action
on
the
part
of
her
crew
that
her
magazine
was
kept
from

raging

reached
her
conning

a
member
of
her
crew
hauled
down
her
flag
and
the
thinking
that
the
fight
was
over
came
close
to
her
while
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
her
however
she
was
greeted
with
new
firing
from
the
german
cruiser
but
this
ceased
under
a
raking
from
the
starboard
guns
and
once
again
the
flag
of
the

had
been
run
up
on

shooting
was
hauled
down

of
her

to
jump
into
the
sea
to
escape
death
from

the
fire
was
quenched
only
when
she
went
down
at
half
past
seven
the
overworked
engineers
and

of
the

rewarded
for
their
hard
work
by
being
permitted
to
come
on
deck
to
watch
the

down
and
all
were
soon
engaged
in
helping
to
save
the
lives
of
the
german
sailors
in

just
as
the
red
glow
of
the
sinking

dying
down
a

out

tinged
red
by

she
went

the

away

almost
kept
the
news
of

out
of

from
the

papers
it

torpedoed
and
that
she
had
been

the
truth

clear
rumors
that

gone
down

denied
by
the
british
admiralty
some
months
later

they
reported

doing

this
was
counteracted

report

duty
off
the

of
the
netherlands
came
up
with
a
british

an
engagement
followed

during
the
first
week
of

proceeded
to
the
harbor
of
the
german
port
of
emden
whence
had
sailed
many
dangerous
german
submarines
and
destroyers
that
preyed
on
british
ships
he
lay
submerged
there
for
a
long
period
keeping
his
men
amused
with
a
phonograph
and
then
carefully
came
to
the
surface
through
the
periscope
he
saw
very
near
him
a
german
destroyer
but
he
feared
that
the
explosion
of
a
torpedo
sent
against
her
would
damage
his
own
craft
so
he
allowed
her
to
steam
off
and
when
she
was
yards
away
he
let
go
with
two
torpedoes
the
second
found
its
mark
and
the
was
no
more
he
immediately
went
beneath
the
surface
and
escaped
the
cordon
of
destroyers
which
immediately
searched
for
him
by
october
the
was
back
in
harwich
its
home
port
on
the
of
october
the
steamer
received
the
signal
and
went
to
rescue
the
crew
of
the
old
british
cruiser
which
had
been
struck
by
two
torpedoes
from
a
german
submarine
near
dunkirk
all
but
of
her
men
were
saved
the
next
victim
of
a
german
submarine
was
the
gunboat
which
in
the
presence
of
thousands
of
persons
on
the
shore
at
deal
foundered
without
loss
of
life
on

one
of

was
to
go
to
the
bottom

retaliation
on
the
of
november

seen
and
rammed
off
the
scotch
coast
and
some
hours
later
was
again
seen
near
by
this
time
she
was
floating
on
the
surface
and
carrying
a
white
flag
the
british
destroyer
brought
up
alongside

days
later

blown
up
in

anchor
at
sheerness
it
was
never
discovered
whether
she
was
a
victim
of
a
torpedo
a
mine
or
an
internal
explosion
it
is
possible
that
a
spy
had
placed
a
heavy
charge
of
explosives
within
her
hull
only
fourteen
men
of
her
entire
complement
survived
the
disaster
it
was
in
november
also
that
the
sometime
german
cruisers
and
now
flying
the
turkish
flag
became
active
again
as
units

a
turkish
fleet
they
bombarded
unfortified
ports
on
the
black
sea
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
retaliation
for
this
was
made
by
the
allies
two
days
later
when
a
combined
fleet
of
french
and
english
battleships
bombarded
the
dardanelles
forts

amount
of
damage

sebastopol
the
composition
of
this

never
made
public
by

it
is
known
that
the

the
flagship

up
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
two
german
ships
and
opened
fire
on
the

the
at
a
distance
of
yards
the
latter
hit
by
the
russian
guns
was
at
first
unable
to
reply
because
the
first
shots
set
her
afire
in
several
places
but
she
finally
let
go
with
her
own
guns
and
after
a
engagement
she
sailed
off

loss
to

of
course
no
force
on
the
island
to
withstand
that
of
the
enemy
and
arrangements
for
surrender
of
the
place
were
made
by
signal
marines
were
sent
ashore
the
public
buildings
were
occupied
the
telegraph
and
telephone
wires
cut
the
wireless
station
destroyed
and
the
german
flag
hauled
down
to
be
replaced
by
the
union
jack
the
germans
taken
prisoners
were
rewarded
for
the
kind
treatment
they
had
accorded
british
residents
before
the
appearance
of
this
british
force
and
were
sent
to
new
zealand
the
next
german
possession
to
be
taken
was
that
in
the
bismarck
archipelago
it
was
known
that
there
was
a
powerful
wireless
station
at
herbertshöhen
the
island
known
as
new
pomerania
a
small
landing
party
was
put
ashore
on
the
island
in
the
early
morning
of
september
and
made
its
way
without
being
discovered
to
the
town
the
surprised
inhabitants
were
too
frightened
to
do
anything
until
this
party
left
to
go
further
on
to
the
wireless
station
by
that
time
it
met
with
some
resistance
but
overcame
it
a
few
days
later
another
landing
party
had
captured
the
members
of
the
staff
of
the
governor
of
new
pomerania
together
with
the
governor
himself
at
bougainville
solomon
islands
whence
they
had
fled
the
wireless
stations
on
the
island
of
yap
in
the
carolines
and
on
pleasant
island
were
destroyed
during
the
following
month
perhaps
the
strangest
operations
of
naval
character
ever
performed
were
the
inland
sea
fights
in
africa
the
great
nyassa
lake
in
africa
was
the
scene
of
this
fighting
with
its
entire
western
shore
in
british
possession
and
with
a
goodly
part
of
its
waters
within
the
territory
of
german
east
africa
it
was
not
unnatural
that
fighting
should
take
place
there
both
countries
maintained
small
armed
vessels
on
the
lake
the
british
ship
a
craft
had
been
built
on
the
clyde
and
had
been
sent
to
nyassa
lake
in
sections
and
there
assembled
and
launched
in
during
august
she
fought
with
a
german
ship
and
captured
it
the
fighting
on
the
lake
could
not
however
determine
the
success
of
the
military
operations
taking
place
in
those
regions
the
preponderance
of
british
naval
strength
was
beginning
to
tell
severely
upon
german
trade
by
the
end
of
and
her
boast
that
through
her
navy
she
would
starve
out
germany
aroused
the
german
government
greatly
in
answer
to
these
british
threats
grand
admiral
von
tirpitz
german
secretary
of
marine
in
an
interview
given
to
an
american
newspaper
correspondent
hinted
that
retaliation
would
be
a
war
on
british
merchant
ships
by
german
submarines
the
interview
at
the
time
aroused
but
mild
comment
the
idea
was
a
new
one
and
the
question
immediately
arose
as
to
whether
such
action
would
be
within
the
limits
of
international
law
for
the
time
being
however
von
tirpitz
words
remained
nothing
more
than
a
threat
it
was
not
until
months
later
that
the
threat
was
made
good
and
the
consequences
must
form
a
separate
part
of
this
narrative
to
be
given
in
volume
iii
the
seaplane
the
newest
naval
machine
at
the
time
and
as
yet
an
untried
factor
was
to
see
maiden
service
first
at
the
hands
of
the
british
when
on
the
of
december
a
raid
on
cuxhaven
was
made
seven
naval
seaplanes
attacked
a
fleet
of
german
cruisers
and
destroyers
lying
off
schilling
roads
near
the
german
port
the
men
who
thus
made
history
in
aviation
were
francis
hewlett
son
of
the
famous
novelist
accompanied
by
seven
pilots
a
naval
force
consisting
of
a
light
cruiser
a
flotilla
of
destroyers
and
another
of
submarines
brought
up
near
helgoland
during
the
morning
when
this
naval
force
was
first
discovered
by
the
lookouts
on
helgoland
there
immediately
appeared
approaching
from
the
german
base
two
zeppelins
and
a
number
of
german
seaplanes
together
with
some
submarines
meanwhile
from
the
decks
of
the
british
craft
there
went
up
the
seven
british
seaplanes
in
order
to
give
them
a
place
for
landing
after
they
returned
from
their
raid
it
was
necessary
for
the
british
ships
to
remain
in
the
vicinity
for
three
hours
the
and
with
the
rest
of
the
british
force
had
to
dance
about
dodging
the
submarines
which
were
attacking
them
from
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
aircraft
hovering
over
them
bombs
dropped
from
the
latter
failed
to
find
their
targets
and
by
swift
maneuvering
the
torpedoes
shot
at
them
were
also
caused
to
go
far
wide
of
the
mark
the
british
airmen
dropped
their
bombs
on
points
of
military
importance
at
cuxhaven
but
their
effect
was
kept
secret
by
the
german
authorities
six
of
the
seven
returned
to
the
squadron
and
were
picked
up
by
submarines
three
of
the
seaplanes
were
wrecked
and
had
to
be
abandoned
fog
not
only
prevented
the
british
airmen
from
doing
their
best
work
but
it
kept
the
marksmen
on
the
german
aircraft
also
from
hitting
the
ships
on
the
waters
beneath
them
this
raid
had
been
made
in
answer
to
a
great
outcry
that
had
gone
up
from
the
british
public
after
german
warships
had
raided
the
eastern
coast
of
england
chapter
xxxix
raids
on
the
english
coast
during
the
first
days
of
november
the
germans
planned
and
carried
out
a
general
surprise
for
the
british
navy
after
the
battle
in
the
bight
of
helgoland
back
in
august
the
british
thought
that
germany
would
continue
to
keep
her
navy
within
the
protection
of
her
coast
defenses
perhaps
forever
but
such
was
not
her
intention
on
the
afternoon
of
november
there
gathered
off
some
part
of
germany
northern
shore
a
squadron
consisting
of
the
battle
cruisers
der
tann
and
the
protected
cruisers
and
the
armored
cruisers
and
together
with
some
destroyers
the
slowest
of
these
vessels
could
make
a
speed
of
knots
and
the
fastest
the
and
could
make
knots
the
guns
of
the
were
the
heaviest
in
the
squadron
those
of
her
primary
battery
being
cannon
guns
were
on
the
decks
of
the
other
ships
the
first
that
the
rest
of
the
world
knew
of
the
gathered
force
was
at
evening
november
when
a
fleet
of
british
fishermen
hailed
them
with
friendly
signs
thinking
them
british
ships
not
far
from
lowestoft
some
time
after
six
the
fishermen
started
at
once
for
their
home
ports
in
order
to
apprise
the
british
authorities
but
they
had
not
gone
far
when
the
news
was
flashed
to
the
british
admiralty
office
from
the
wireless
room
of
the
british
gunboat
but
only
the
first
few
words
of
the
warning
were
able
to
get
through
for
the
wireless
operators
on
the
german
ships
jammed
their
keys
and
a
few
shots
from
the
german
guns
were
sufficient
to
bring
down
the
wireless
apparatus
of
the
gunboat
as
well
as
one
of
her
funnels
she
turned
off
and
made
for
her
home
port
to
report
the
news
some
hours
later
it
was
only
ten
miles
from
the
british
shores
that
the
had
sighted
the
german
ships
but
they
were
able
nevertheless
to
elude
all
british
warships
in
those
regions
and
proceeded
to
yarmouth
firing
at
the
wireless
station
the
naval
yards
and
the
town
itself
fearing
mines
near
the
coast
the
german
commander
did
not
attempt
to
come
in
too
close
with
the
result
that
many
of
the
german
shots
fell
short
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
bombardment
lasted
for
nearly
half
an
hour
the
damage
done
by
them
was
not
great
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
of
lowestoft
and
yarmouth
were
asleep
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
they
first
heard
the
booming
of
the
german
guns
in
the
darkness
of
the
british
winter
they
hurriedly
went
down
to
the
water
front
where
far
out
at
sea
they
could
make
out
faintly
the
hull
of
but
one
vessel
but
the
red
flashes
from
the
booming
guns
showed
that
other
ships
were
present
the
crowds
on
the
shore
watched
two
british
destroyers
and
two
submarines
which
had
been
lying
in
the
harbor
put
out
after
the
german
force
the
latter
by
that
time
had
started
off
dropping
in
its
wake
a
number
of
floating
mines
this
strategy
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
submarine
which
hit
one
of
the
mines
and
sank
immediately
the
german
cruiser
was
claimed
by
the
british
to
have
hit
a
mine
also
with
the
result
that
she
sank
and
carried
down
with
her
some
of
her
crew
this
was
denied
later
by
the
german
admiralty
and
like
all
such
controversies
must
remain
a
secret
with
the
officials
of
both
governments
judged
by
material
effects
this
raid
was
a
failure
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
germans
had
shown
that
a
squadron
could
actually
elude
the
large
number
of
british
warships
patrolling
the
north
sea
and
was
actually
able
to
strike
at
the
british
coast
it
was
a
moral
victory
for
germany
we
must
see
clearly
that
in
order
to
fight
with
success
we
must
fight
ruthlessly
in
the
proper
meaning
of
the
word
these
were
the
words
of
count
reventlow
when
he
heard
the
news
of
the
defeat
of
the
german
squadron
commanded
by
von
spee
off
the
falkland
islands
as
a
result
and
in
revenge
for
this
defeat
the
german
admiralty
planned
a
second
raid
on
the
coast
towns
of
england
the
towns
chosen
for
attack
this
time
were
hartlepool
scarborough
and
whitby
the
first
of
these
was
a
city
of
persons
and
its
principal
business
was
shipbuilding
scarborough
was
nothing
more
than
a
seaside
resort
to
which
each
summer
and
at
christmas
were
attracted
thousands
of
englishmen
who
sought
to
spend
their
vacations
near
the
water
whitby
though
it
had
some
attractions
for
holiday
crowds
such
as
a
quaint
cathedral
was
at
most
nothing
more
than
a
home
port
for
a
number
of
fishing
boats
it
was
claimed
later
by
the
germans
that
these
three
towns
according
to
the
accepted
definitions
in
international
law
were
fortified
ports
and
consequently
open
to
attack
by
hostile
forces
in
reply
the
british
claimed
that
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
three
which
could
bring
them
into
that
category
this
controversy
is
still
another
which
must
remain
undecided
there
is
however
the
fact
that
the
information
which
the
german
government
had
obtained
about
them
and
which
it
made
public
must
necessarily
have
been
less
comprehensive
than
that
supplied
to
the
world
at
large
by
the
british
authorities
guidebooks
as
well
as
tourists
who
have
visited
the
place
reported
that
an
old
castle
stood
in
scarborough
which
in
past
centuries
had
been
a
fort
but
which
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
was
nothing
more
than
a
show
place
the
only
gun
in
place
at
the
castle
was
an
obsolete
piece
that
had
seen
service
in
the
crimean
war
whitby
in
times
of
peace
at
least
had
not
even
such
armament
it
was
on
the
of
december
that
this
second
raid
took
place
over
the
north
sea
there
hung
a
light
mist
the
german
admiralty
did
not
afterward
make
public
the
names
of
the
cruisers
which
participated
in
this
expedition
but
they
are
believed
to
have
been
the
blücher
von
der
tann
and
it
was
at
eight
in
the
morning
that
the
residents
of
the
three
english
towns
first
heard
the
booming
of
the
german
guns
and
coast
guards
near
by
were
able
with
the
aid
of
very
strong
glasses
to
make
out
the
hulls
of
the
attacking
cruisers
some
miles
out
to
sea
it
was
not
thought
possible
that
the
germans
could
again
elude
the
british
ships
on
patrol
in
these
waters
and
the
guards
therefore
thought
that
the
firing
came
from
ships
flying
the
union
jack
and
tried
to
signal
to
them
but
they
came
to
realize
the
truth
when
they
received
no
answering
signals
as
it
was
not
known
but
that
the
germans
would
make
an
attempt
to
land
the
guards
in
the
obsolete
fort
at
hartlepool
took
their
positions
and
two
small
patrol
boats
in
the
harbor
made
ready
to
give
what
resistance
they
could
these
the
and
the
drew
the
fire
of
the
german
guns
and
seeing
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
the
german
fire
they
made
off
and
escaped
this
time
the
germans
were
better
informed
about
the
conditions
they
dealt
with
and
evidently
had
no
fear
of
mines
for
they
came
to
within
two
miles
of
the
shore
the
forts
on
shore
were
bombarded
and
private
houses
near
by
were
hit
by
german
shells
killing
two
women
who
lived
in
one
of
them
the
forts
tried
to
reply
to
the
german
guns
but
those
of
the
english
battery
were
by
no
means
modern
and
firing
them
only
served
to
further
convince
the
germans
that
the
place
was
fortified
they
inflicted
no
damage
on
the
german
ships
the
lighthouse
was
the
next
target
chosen
by
the
germans
one
of
their
shells
going
right
through
it
but
leaving
it
standing
within
fifty
minutes
german
shells
were
fired
into
the
town
and
harbor
while
two
of
the
three
cruisers
which
were
engaged
in
bombarding
drew
off
further
to
sea
and
fired
at
hartlepool
the
third
remained
to
finish
the
battery
on
shore
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
subjected
to
long
and
heavy
firing
it
was
not
so
terribly
damaged
many
of
the
shells
from
the
other
two
ships
went
over
the
towns
entirely
and
buried
themselves
in
the
countryside
that
heretofore
had
been
turned
up
only
by
the
peaceful
plow
other
shells
did
havoc
in
the
business
and
residential
sections
of
hartlepool
and
west
hartlepool
bringing
down
buildings
and
killing
civilians
in
them
as
well
as
on
the
streets
at
about
the
same
hour
the
coast
guards
near
scarborough
reported
the
approach
of
foreign
ships
off
the
coast
and
then
telephoned
that
the
strangers
were
german
cruisers
and
that
they
had
begun
to
bombard
the
town
a
german
shell
destroyed
the
shed
from
which
the
telephone
message
had
come
and
the
warnings
from
it
ceased
it
was
seen
by
those
on
shore
that
the
attack
here
was
being
made
by
four
ships
two
of
them
cruisers
and
two
of
them
mine
layers
only
yards
out
in
the
water
this
time
they
were
not
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
they
had
to
stand
out
so
far
from
shore
and
it
was
a
surprise
to
the
natives
to
see
ships
of
such
draft
come
so
close
to
land
a
fact
which
convinced
the
british
authorities
that
spies
had
been
at
work
since
the
first
raid
sending
to
the
german
admiralty
either
charts
or
detailed
descriptions
of
the
region
the
castle
was
badly
damaged
by
their
fire
the
town
itself
came
next
the
grand
hotel
coming
in
for
its
share
of
destruction
they
did
little
injury
to
a
wireless
station
in
the
suburbs
but
hit
quite
a
number
of
residences
the
gas
and
water
works
half
an
hour
afterward
the
two
cruisers
which
had
fired
upon
scarborough
appeared
off
whitby
and
began
to
fire
at
the
signal
station
there
in
the
ten
minutes
that
the
bombardment
of
whitby
lasted
some
shells
fell
into
the
place
this
time
the
fact
that
the
german
ships
came
close
to
the
shore
worked
against
them
for
there
are
high
cliffs
close
to
the
water
at
the
spot
and
it
was
necessary
for
the
german
gunners
to
use
a
high
angle
which
did
not
give
them
much
chance
to
be
accurate
the
german
ships
next
turned
seaward
and
made
for
their
home
ports
the
scenes
enacted
in
the
three
towns
during
the
bombardment
and
afterwards
were
tragic
considering
the
fact
however
that
the
persons
under
fire
were
civilians
many
of
them
women
and
children
their
coolness
was
remarkable
they
did
not
know
what
should
be
done
for
the
thought
of
bombardment
was
the
last
thing
that
had
come
into
the
minds
of
the
authorities
when
england
went
to
war
and
as
a
result
no
instructions
for
such
an
emergency
had
been
issued
by
the
authorities
some
thought
it
best
to
stay
within
doors
some
thought
it
best
to
go
into
the
streets
in
hartlepool
a
large
crowd
gathered
in
the
railway
station
some
fully
dressed
some
only
in
night
clothes
many
of
the
women
carried
babies
in
their
arms
and
were
followed
by
older
children
who
clung
to
their
skirts
policemen
led
this
crowd
out
of
the
station
and
started
them
along
a
street
which
would
bring
them
out
into
the
country
but
while
they
were
passing
the
library
they
were
showered
by
the
stone
work
as
it
fell
when
hit
by
the
german
shells
one
shell
striking
the
street
itself
killed
three
of
the
six
children
who
were
fleeing
along
it
in
company
with
their
mother
many
other
persons
met
deaths
as
tragic
either
within
their
own
homes
or
on
the
streets
mary
catholic
church
as
well
as
the
church
of
hilda
were
damaged
as
were
the
shipyards
and
the
office
of
the
local
newspaper
the
destruction
of
the
gas
works
left
the
town
in
almost
complete
darkness
for
many
nights
afterward
the
authorities
issued
a
proclamation
ordering
all
citizens
to
remain
indoors
for
a
time
and
then
began
to
count
the
number
of
dead
and
injured
the
first
estimate
gave
the
former
as
and
the
latter
as
but
subsequent
reckoning
showed
that
both
figures
were
too
low
in
scarborough
most
of
the
inhabitants
were
still
in
bed
when
the
bombardment
started
and
for
a
few
minutes
did
not
become
excited
thinking
the
booming
of
the
guns
was
the
sound
of
thunder
but
when
the
shells
began
to
drop
on
their
houses
they
knew
better
many
were
killed
or
wounded
while
they
hastily
got
into
their
clothes
one
shell
hit
martin
church
while
communion
was
being
held
here
too
the
railway
station
was
made
the
objective
of
many
refugees
and
the
police
did
what
they
could
to
send
the
women
and
children
out
of
range
of
fire
by
putting
them
on
trains
of
extra
length
as
in
all
such
scenes
there
were
humorous
sides
to
it
one
old
workman
while
hurrying
along
a
street
was
heard
to
say
this
is
what
comes
of
having
a
liberal
government
in
all
about
people
left
the
town
immediately
and
did
not
return
for
some
days
similar
were
the
scenes
enacted
in
whitby
when
the
turn
of
that
town
came
only
two
persons
were
killed
in
that
town
while
thirteen
casualties
were
reported
from
scarborough
the
raid
immediately
became
the
subject
for
discussion
in
the
newspapers
of
every
country
on
the
globe
in
england
it
was
bitterly
denounced
and
the
term
baby
killers
was
applied
to
the
men
of
the
german
navy
in
germany
it
was
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
german
admiralty
had
information
and
proof
that
the
bombarded
cities
were
fortified
and
therefore
under
international
law
subject
to
bombardment
nor
did
the
german
journalists
lose
the
opportunity
to
declare
that
great
britain
no
longer
ruled
the
waves
nor
to
show
pride
over
the
fact
that
their
fleet
had
successfully
left
the
german
coast
and
had
successfully
returned
to
its
home
port
the
war
they
said
and
truthfully
had
been
brought
to
door
the
year
ended
gloomily
for
the
british
public
nothing
could
have
disappointed
them
more
than
the
failure
to
catch
the
germans
nor
did
the
new
year
open
brightly
for
britain
for
on
the
first
day
of
january
there
came
the
news
of
disaster
to
the
sister
ship
to
the
the
lesson
of
the
and
had
not
been
learned
for
this
ship
went
down
under
the
same
circumstances
while
patrolling
near
torbay
during
a
night
on
which
there
was
a
bright
moon
and
a
calm
sea
this
ship
in
company
with
seven
other
large
ships
unaccompanied
by
a
screen
of
destroyers
was
hit
by
a
torpedo
fired
from
a
german
submarine
most
of
her
crew
were
asleep
when
the
torpedo
struck
and
damaged
the
engine
room
so
much
that
no
lights
could
be
turned
on
in
the
darkness
they
hurried
to
the
deck
which
was
slanting
from
her
list
in
obedience
to
orders
issued
by
the
admiralty
after
the
sinking
of
the
and
the
ships
with
her
the
rest
of
the
fleet
immediately
sailed
away
from
the
scene
so
that
no
more
of
them
would
be
hit
only
a
light
cruiser
stood
by
the
sinking
a
second
torpedo
struck
her
and
this
had
the
effect
of
letting
water
into
her
hold
on
the
side
which
was
slowly
coming
out
of
the
water
she
took
a
position
with
even
keel
after
that
and
this
fact
enabled
most
of
her
crew
to
get
off
safely
before
she
sank
once
more
the
germans
were
to
attempt
a
raid
on
the
coast
cities
of
england
the
date
of
this
third
attempt
was
january
this
time
the
british
were
a
bit
better
prepared
for
a
squadron
of
battle
cruisers
consisting
of
the
tiger
princess
royal
new
and
put
out
from
a
port
in
the
north
of
england
at
about
the
same
time
that
the
germans
left
their
base
all
of
these
ships
with
the
exception
of
the
last
named
were
quite
fast
having
speeds
of
from
to
knots
they
were
at
the
same
time
carrying
heavy
armament
guns
in
the
main
batteries
in
company
with
them
went
four
cruisers
of
what
is
known
in
england
as
the
town
class
these
were
the
birmingham
and
together
with
the
three
light
cruisers
and
and
a
squadron
of
destroyers
the
german
fleet
which
was
engaged
in
this
raid
consisted
of
the
moltke
and
in
company
with
a
fleet
of
destroyers
the
german
ships
were
not
quite
as
fast
as
the
english
ships
nor
did
they
carry
guns
of
such
range
or
destructive
power
as
their
british
opponents
early
in
the
first
hours
of
january
these
two
forces
unknown
to
each
other
were
steaming
head
on
the
germans
taking
a
course
leading
northwest
and
the
english
a
course
leading
southeast
at
twenty
minutes
past
seven
in
the
morning
the
first
sighted
the
enemy
and
engaged
him
immediately
with
her
two
guns
sending
at
the
same
time
word
of
her
discovery
to
admiral
beatty
admiral
hipper
the
german
commander
as
soon
as
he
knew
the
enemy
had
sighted
him
turned
about
and
started
to
steam
in
a
southeasterly
direction
in
view
of
the
results
of
this
battle
it
is
best
to
go
into
the
matter
of
the
tactics
involved
tactics
may
be
of
two
kinds
spontaneous
or
premeditated
when
two
hostile
fleets
meet
on
the
high
sea
far
from
the
base
of
either
the
object
of
each
is
the
complete
destruction
of
the
other
and
the
tactics
employed
are
spontaneous
such
an
action
was
that
off
coronel
but
on
a
closed
sea
such
as
the
north
sea
spontaneous
tactics
can
rarely
be
used
for
the
reason
that
naval
bases
are
too
near
and
from
these
there
may
slyly
come
reenforcements
to
one
or
the
other
or
to
both
of
the
fighting
fleets
making
the
arrangement
of
traps
an
easy
matter
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
north
sea
on
which
it
is
possible
for
a
fleet
to
leave
cuxhaven
early
in
the
evening
and
to
be
at
scarborough
early
the
following
morning
in
addition
sailing
is
restricted
because
an
unusually
large
portion
of
its
waters
is
too
shallow
to
permit
of
the
passage
of
large
ships
the
germans
on
this
occasion
had
arranged
a
trap
they
knew
that
after
making
two
successful
raids
on
the
english
coast
the
british
would
keep
even
a
closer
watch
for
them
when
they
sailed
from
their
base
it
was
with
the
expectation
of
meeting
a
hostile
force
as
was
undoubtedly
their
expectation
on
the
first
two
raids
but
they
did
not
intend
to
fight
matters
out
on
high
waters
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
the
british
involved
in
a
good
running
engagement
steering
a
southeasterly
course
the
while
and
luring
the
british
ships
within
striking
force
of
a
waiting
fleet
of
superdreadnoughts
and
perhaps
land
guns
and
mines
this
explains
why
admiral
hipper
turned
stern
as
soon
as
he
got
into
touch
with
the
enemy
there
was
a
distance
of
fourteen
miles
between
the
two
fleets
when
the
got
her
heavy
guns
into
action
the
german
line
was
off
her
port
left
bow
at
the
head
of
that
line
was
the
and
following
her
came
the
derfflinger
and
the
destroyers
in
the
order
given
at
the
head
of
the
british
line
was
the
followed
by
the
princess
royal
new
and
in
the
order
named
the
other
cruisers
and
the
destroyers
of
the
british
fleet
brought
up
the
rear
in
the
chase
which
followed
the
germans
were
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
the
was
far
too
slow
to
be
brought
into
action
which
meant
that
either
the
other
ships
must
leave
her
behind
to
certain
destruction
or
that
they
must
slow
down
to
keep
with
her
they
chose
the
latter
course
while
her
stokers
did
their
best
to
increase
her
speed
in
the
english
fleet
there
was
the
same
trouble
with
the
but
inasmuch
as
the
british
were
the
pursuers
and
had
a
preponderance
in
ships
and
in
the
range
of
their
guns
this
did
not
matter
so
much
to
them
but
the
stokers
of
the
worked
as
hard
if
not
harder
than
those
of
the
by
half
past
nine
the
two
forces
were
seven
miles
apart
and
the
battle
was
on
it
is
necessary
here
to
give
certain
facts
about
gunnery
on
a
large
modern
battleship
firing
at
a
range
of
seven
miles
means
a
test
of
mathematics
rather
than
of
the
mere
matter
of
pointing
guns
at
that
distance
the
target
the
ship
to
be
hit
is
barely
visible
on
the
sky
line
on
the
clearest
and
calmest
sea
if
a
hole
the
size
of
the
head
of
a
pin
be
made
in
a
piece
of
cardboard
and
the
latter
he
held
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
eye
the
distant
ship
will
just
about
fill
the
hole
the
guns
on
the
modern
battleships
are
not
laid
that
is
they
are
not
aimed
as
were
the
cannon
of
past
days
or
the
rifle
of
today
it
is
set
toward
its
target
by
two
factors
the
first
is
known
as
traverse
which
means
how
far
to
the
left
or
right
it
must
be
pointed
in
a
horizontal
plane
the
second
factor
is
elevation
how
far
up
or
down
it
must
be
pointed
in
a
vertical
plane
the
latter
factor
determines
how
far
it
will
throw
its
projectile
and
up
to
a
certain
point
the
higher
the
gun
is
pointed
the
further
will
go
the
shell
a
certain
paradox
seems
to
enter
here
it
is
a
fact
that
a
distant
ship
presents
a
target
more
easily
hit
if
its
bow
or
stern
is
toward
the
gunner
if
it
presents
a
broadside
there
is
the
danger
that
the
shells
will
go
either
beyond
the
ship
or
will
fall
short
of
it
for
the
greatest
beam
on
a
warship
is
not
much
more
than
feet
if
the
bow
or
stern
is
toward
the
gunner
he
has
a
chance
of
landing
a
shell
on
any
part
of
the
or
more
feet
of
the
ship
length
the
first
firing
in
a
battle
at
a
distance
is
known
as
straddling
by
which
is
meant
that
a
number
of
shots
are
sent
simultaneously
some
falling
short
some
falling
beyond
the
target
and
some
hitting
it
the
man
who
really
aims
the
gun
never
sees
what
he
is
shooting
at
at
some
point
of
vantage
on
his
ship
one
of
the
officers
observes
the
enemy
and
reports
to
the
chief
gunner
the
distance
the
direction
and
the
effect
of
the
first
shots
the
gunnery
officer
then
makes
certain
calculations
taking
into
consideration
the
speed
of
his
own
ship
and
the
speed
of
the
enemy
ship
he
knows
that
at
a
given
moment
his
target
will
be
at
a
given
point
he
knows
also
just
how
fast
his
shells
will
travel
and
makes
calculations
that
enable
him
to
place
a
shell
at
that
point
at
just
the
right
second
in
this
battle
the
shells
of
the
british
ship
took
about
twenty
seconds
to
go
from
the
mouths
of
the
guns
to
the
german
hulls
and
they
made
a
curve
at
the
highest
point
of
which
they
reached
a
distance
of
more
than
two
miles
and
most
wonderful
of
all
was
the
fact
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
firing
a
man
standing
on
the
deck
of
one
of
the
german
ships
could
not
even
see
the
ship
which
was
firing
the
shells
at
her
though
the
weather
was
very
clear
by
a
quarter
to
ten
the
had
come
up
with
and
had
passed
the
slow
firing
broadsides
into
her
as
she
went
by
the
then
passed
the
unfortunate
german
ship
also
letting
her
have
a
heavy
fire
and
then
the
did
likewise
finally
the
was
able
to
engage
her
and
later
even
the
slow
got
near
enough
to
do
so
by
that
time
the
was
afire
and
one
of
her
gun
turrets
with
its
crew
and
gun
had
been
swept
off
bodily
by
a
british
shell
meanwhile
the
and
kept
straight
ahead
till
they
were
able
to
straddle
even
the
leading
ship
of
the
enemy
line
the
and
poured
shells
into
the
but
were
unable
to
do
much
damage
to
the
while
they
were
thus
engaged
the
singled
out
the
for
her
target
the
light
british
cruiser
and
were
far
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
british
fleet
and
were
firing
at
the
but
thick
black
smoke
which
poured
from
their
funnels
as
their
engines
were
speeded
up
got
between
the
gunners
of
the
and
their
target
the
completely
obscuring
the
latter
as
a
result
the
three
light
british
cruisers
were
ordered
to
slow
down
and
to
take
positions
to
the
rear
by
eleven
there
were
fires
raging
on
both
the
and
the
and
admiral
hipper
decided
to
try
to
save
his
larger
ships
by
sacrificing
the
destroyers
that
accompanied
them
consequently
the
german
destroyers
put
their
bows
right
toward
the
large
british
ships
and
charged
but
the
fire
which
they
drew
was
too
much
for
them
and
they
gave
up
this
maneuver
the
british
destroyer
which
had
been
maintaining
a
perilous
position
between
the
battleships
then
attempted
to
torpedo
the
which
had
fallen
far
to
the
rearward
to
be
abandoned
by
the
rest
of
the
german
fleet
badly
damaged
as
the
was
the
crew
of
one
of
her
guns
managed
to
get
in
some
final
shots
one
of
them
nearly
ending
the
career
of
the
british
destroyer
the
had
also
come
up
and
prepared
to
launch
a
torpedo
cruiser
and
destroyer
torpedoed
her
at
about
the
same
moment
and
later
while
within
yards
of
the
sinking
german
ship
the
sent
another
torpedo
at
her
she
now
began
to
list
although
not
greatly
damaged
on
her
port
side
till
her
keel
showed
her
crew
showed
remarkable
bravery
the
men
lined
up
as
though
at
a
review
and
began
to
sing
the
german
national
airs
intending
to
go
to
their
deaths
in
that
formation
but
an
officer
on
the
shouted
to
them
through
a
megaphone
to
jump
while
they
could
to
save
their
lives
this
had
a
psychological
effect
and
as
the
starboard
side
of
her
hull
slowly
came
up
her
men
were
seen
scrambling
on
it
from
behind
her
taff
rail
and
creeping
down
toward
her
keel
some
of
them
almost
walked
into
the
water
while
she
was
in
that
position
her
guns
were
pointing
toward
the
sky
one
of
them
slowly
revolving
finally
when
she
was
completely
upside
down
she
went
under
many
of
her
crew
were
picked
up
by
british
small
boats
and
her
captain
who
was
one
of
them
was
taken
to
england
where
he
died
later
from
the
results
of
this
experience
and
was
buried
with
full
naval
honors
the
german
destroyers
had
meanwhile
come
between
their
own
cruisers
and
those
of
the
enemy
and
emitted
volumes
of
heavy
smoke
which
they
hoped
would
form
an
effective
screen
between
the
former
and
the
gunners
on
the
latter
admiral
hipper
then
ordered
all
of
his
ships
to
turn
northward
in
the
hope
of
getting
away
behind
this
screen
but
the
british
admiral
anticipated
this
maneuver
and
changed
the
course
of
his
ships
so
that
he
again
had
the
german
ships
in
view
after
both
fleets
had
driven
through

of
the

was
making
this

hit
her
water

and
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
use
her
port
engine
from
that
time
on
she
slowed
down
when
she
fell
out
of
the
line
it
was
necessary
for
admiral
beatty
to
leave
her
and
he
transferred
his
flag
to
the
destroyer
but
all
of
this
took
time
and
it
was
quite
long
before
he
was
able
to
rejoin
his
leading
ships
by
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
he
had
got
aboard
the
rear
admiral
moore
automatically
took
up
command
of
the
british
fleet
while
his
senior
officer
was
making
these
changes
it
is
not
known
what
admiral
moore
orders
had
been
but
it
is
known
that
he
suddenly
ordered
all
ships
to
cease
firing
and
allowed
the
german
warships
to
proceed
without
further
engaging
them
by
the
time
that
admiral
beatty
was
again
on
a
battle
cruiser
the
action
was
virtually
over
the
passed

to
the
crippled
and
towed
the
latter
home
the
rest
of
the
british
fleet
keeping
to
the
rearward
to
be
ready
for
possible
resumption
of
fighting
much
criticism
was
made
by
the
british
press
and
by
laymen
on
account
of
the
sudden
termination
of
the
fight
and
there
was
great
complaint
in
england
because
the
career
of
all
the
raiding
german
ships
had
not
been
brought
to
an
end
but
when
the
engagement
ended
the
opposing
fleets
were
within
seventy
miles
of
helgoland
and
the
german
admiralty
had
ready
a
fleet
of
dreadnoughts
and
another
of
battle
cruisers
to
engage
the
british
ships
when
they
got
within
striking
distance
by
ending
the
fight
when
he
did
the
british
commander
chose
not
to
be
led
into
this
trap
nor
was
there
dissatisfaction
in
england
alone
in
germany
the
complaint
was
that
the
ruse
had
not
worked
and
not
long
afterward
admiral
von
ingenohl
was
replaced
as
commander
of
the
high
sea
fleet
by
admiral
von
pohl
none
of
the
blame
for
the
failure
was
laid
at
the
door
of
the
officer
who
had
actually
been
engaged
in
the
fighting
admiral
hipper
which
showed
that
his
senior
officers
had
considered
the
engagement
as
part
of
a
larger
action

the
first
six
months
of
naval
operations
in
the
great
war
came
to
a
close
without
battle
between
the
main
fleets
of
the
navies
of
the
warring
nations
the
british
navy
had
kept
open
communication
with
the
continent
allowing
the
expeditionary
force
as
well
as
later
military
contingents
to
get
to
the
trenches
in
flanders
and
france
it
had
in
addition
made
possible
the
transportation
of
troops
from
canada
and
australia
the
ports
of
france
were
open
for
commerce
with
america
which
permitted
the
importation
of
arms
and
munitions
and
the
same
privilege
had
been
won
for
the
ports
in
the
british
isles
the
northern
ports
of
the
central
powers
were
closed
to
commerce

all

the

up
the
mystery

the

had
not
taken
off
as
many
ships
as
had
been
lost
by
germany
herself
and
as
england
ships
so
far
outnumbered
her
own
it
may
well
be
said
that
the
whittling
policy
was
not
successful
she
made
up
for
this
by
having
still
at
large
the
cruiser
which
damaged
a
great
amount
of
commerce
and
by
the
exploits
of
her
submarines
far
outshining
those
of
the
allies
russia
had
lost
the
armored
cruiser
and
the
a
cruiser
and
the
losses
of
the
french
and
austrian
navies
were
not
worth
accounting
with
regard
to
interned
vessels
both
sides
had
losses
while
the
germans
were
unable
to
use
the
great
modern
merchantmen
which
lay
in
american
and
other
ports
and
had
to
do
without
them
either
as
converted
cruisers
or
transports
the
allies
were
forced
to
detail
warships
to
keep
guard
at
the
entrance
of
the
various
ports
where
these
interned
german
liners
might
at
any
moment
take
to
the
high
seas
in
naval
warfare
the
number
of
ships
lost
is
no
determining
factor
in
figuring
the
actual
victory
the
important
thing
being
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
grand
fleets
of
the
combatants
after
the
fighting
is
finished
viewed
from
such
an
angle
the
fact
that
the
allies
had
left
no
german
ships
at
large
other
than
those
in
the
north
sea
can
not
entitle
them
to
victory
at
the
end
of
the
first
six
months
of
war
so
long
as
a
german
fleet
remained
intact
and
interned
in
neutral
ports
naval
victory
for
the
allies
had
not
come
though
naval
supremacy
was
indicated
the
fact
was
apparent
moreover
that
while
the
central
powers
were
being
deprived
of
all
their
trade
on

seas
the
commerce
endangered

the

includes
the
scenes
of
the
fighting
in
the
historic
balkans
and
in
the
caucasus
but
the
eastern
front
proper
is
really
that
region
where
the
teutonic
allies
and
the
russians
opposed
each
other
forming
a
fighting
line
almost
a
thousand
miles
long
it
stretches
from
rugged
old
riga

the
shores
of

baltic

far
north

the

warm
sunlit
hills
on
the
rumanian
frontier
when
the
total
losses
of
the
great
war
are
finally
counted
it
will
probably
be
found
that
here
the
heaviest
fighting
has
occurred
this
is
the
longest
battle
line
in
the
world
history
partly
on
account
of
its
great
length
and
partly
because
of
the
nature
of
the
country
we
see
the
two
gigantic
forces
in
this
region
locked
together
in
their
deadly
struggle
swaying
back

ancient
abode
of
the
lithuanians

to
be
the
first
of
the
slavic
tribes
to
appear
in
europe
hardly
any
part
of
europe
has
a
more
forbidding
aspect
than
this
region
there
the
armies
must
pass
over
a
flat
undulating
country
almost
as
low
in
level
as
the
baltic
and
therefore
occupied
in
large
part
by
marshes
and
lagoons
through
which
they
must
struggle
in
all
parts
the
soil
is
unproductive
at
one
time
it
was
a
universal
forest
thick
dark
and
dank
a
century
ago
however
catherine
the
great
distributed
large
areas
of
this
comparatively
worthless
land
among
her
favorites
and
courtiers
in
this
way
a
certain
percentage
was
reclaimed
and
with
the
incoming
of
the
sunlight
more
favorable
conditions
for
human
life
were
established
yet
even
now
it
is
very
thinly
settled
through
this
region
the
armies
must
cross
big
rivers

and

the

only
to

in
commercial
importance
as
a
seaport
and
with
a
population
of
about
as
the
armies
move
across
the
frontier
they
come
to
a
vast
domain
projecting
into
this
marsh

a
great
broad
tongue
licking
the
shore
of

this
wide
strip
of

from

in

haff
and
about
miles
from
the
seacoast
is
situated
another
embattled
stronghold
the
city
of
königsberg
which
since
has
been
a
fortress
of
the
first
rank
these
two
cities
in
the
following
pages
will
be
the
immediate
objectives
of
the
enemy
forces
operating
on
this
section
of
the
eastern
front
it
will
be
obvious
why
the
lines
of
battle
were
less
permanently
fixed
here
than
in
the
more
solid
and
mountainous
sections
of
northern
france
railroads
and
fairly
highways
do
indeed
traverse
these
swamps
in
various
parts
especially
in
german
territory
but
trenches
could
not
be
dug
in
yielding
mire
in
yet
another
feature
were
the
military
operations
hampered
by
the
nature
of
the
terrain
here
the
use
of
heavy
artillery
we
have
seen
that
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
success
attending
german
attacks
in
the
other
theatres
of
the
war
has
been
their
use
of
heavy
guns
but
in
the
fighting
before
riga
we
shall
see
when
the
germans
seemed
on
the
point
of
taking
that
city
their
heavy
artillery
was
so
handicapped
that
it
was
rendered
practically
useless
being
restricted
by
the
marshes
to
an
attack
over
a
comparatively
narrow
front
they
were
compelled
to
leave
their
heavy
guns
behind
on
firmer
soil
the
guns
which
they
could
take
with
them
were
matched
by
the
russians
the
fighting
was
therefore
almost
entirely
limited
to
infantry
engagements
in
which
the
russians
were
not
inferior
to
the
germans
thus
we
shall
find
the
german
advance
on
riga
was
stopped
before
it
could
attain
its
object
in
studying
the
fighting
in
this
part
of
the
eastern
front
it
will
be
seen
why
the
germans
were
more
successful
below
riga
and
why
the
russians
were
compelled
to
evacuate
vilna
here
is
a
broad
rise
something
like
the
back
of
a
submarine
which
seems
to
cross
the
country
where
the
land
becomes
more
solid
the
armies
must
move
instead
of
through
marshes
along
innumerable
small
lakes
most
of
the
lakes
being
long
and
narrow
and
running
north
and
south
with
a
fairly
thick
growth
of
timber
among
them
mostly
pine
and
spruce
and
fir
in
character
this
section
is
rather
similar
to
parts
of
minnesota
there
are
two
cities
to
be
conquered
in
this
drier
region
dvinsk
and
further
south
vilna
once
the
chief
city
or
capital
of
the
lithuanians
we
shall
see
the
russians
thrust
back
from
königsberg
and
the
heavy
fighting
shifted
over
to
this
section
yet
even
here
where
the
huge
guns
of
the
germans
could
find
footing
the
terrain
was
not
suited
to
trench
warfare
and
every
arrival
of
reenforcements
on
either
side
would
swing
the
lines
back
or
forth
in
studying
the
military
movements
in
a
country
of
this
character
special
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
railway
lines
railways
and
more
especially
those
running
parallel
to
the
fronts
are
absolutely
necessary
to
success
in
looking
therefore
for
a
key
to
the
object
of
any
particular
movement
the
first
step
must
be
a
close
study
of
this
railroad
situation
we
find
from
riga
to
the
fortress
of
rovno
there
is
a
continuous
line
of
railroad
running
generally
north
and
south
and
passing
through
dvinsk
vilna
lida
rovno
and
thence
down
through
poland
to
lemberg
every
effort
of
the
russian
armies
in
the
succeeding
chapters
will
be
made
to
keep
to
the
westward
of
and
parallel
to
this
line
and
for
a
very
good
reason
feeding
into
this
great
north
and
south
artery
are
the
branch
lines
from
petrograd
to
dvinsk
from
moscow
to
the
junction
at
baranovitschi
from
kiev
to
sarny
aside
from
these
three
important
branch
lines
there
are
a
few
other
offshoots
but
from
a
military
point
of
view
they
are
of
no
importance
this
line
was
the
main
objective
short
of
capturing
riga
itself
of
the
german
operations
this
line
proves
especially
vital
to
the
russians
for
nowhere
east
of
it
is
there
another
such
line
which
could
be
used
for
the
same
purpose
if
in
the
campaigns
to
be
described
this
railroad
falls
into
russian
hands
it
gives
every
facility
for
strengthening
or
reenforcing
any
part
of
the
russian
front
where
german
pressure
becomes
excessive
it
is
in
addition
a
solution
to
the
difficult
problem
of
transportation
of
supplies
to
use
a
military
term
it
gives
the
russian
army
a
mobility
not
possessed
by
the
enemy
because
of
a
lack
of
similar
facilities
but
should
this
railroad
be
taken
by
the
germans
the
advantage
would
immediately
be
reversed
and
if
once
the
russian
lines
were
driven
back
beyond
the
railroad
a
division
of
their
forces
would
be
forced
upon
them
their
armies
would
be
obliged
to
group
themselves
beside
the
three
east
and
west
branches
already
mentioned
for
only
by
these
three
systems
could
their
forces
be
supplied
lateral
communications
being
absolutely
lacking
and
this
is
the
key
to
the
fighting
not
only
in
the
northern
section
of
the
front
but
all
along
the
line
down
to
galicia
naturally
only
the
russian
railroads
need
be
considered
for
in
the
first
months
of
the
war
the
germans
are
the
invaders
in
the
northern
half
of
the
eastern
front
except
for
a
few
short
periods
in
the
beginning
compared
to
the
german
railway
lines
near
the
frontier
the
russian
lines
are
very
few
there
are
two
distinct
railway
lines
running
from
germany
into
east
prussia
with
innumerable
branches
leading
to
all
points
of
the
russian
frontier
laid
especially
for
military
purposes
it
was
along
these
that
we
shall
witness
the
german
forces
rushed
from
belgium
to
drive
back
the
first
russian
advance
but
of
course
the
moment
the
germans
enter
russian
territory
they
have
no
advantage
over
the
russians
since
even
their
wonderful
efficiency
does
not
enable
them
to
build
railroads
as
fast
as
an
army
can
advance
hence
we
observe
their
efforts
to
gain
possession
of
the
russian
railroads
we
come
now
to

of

russian

projects
into
german
territory
in
a
great

about

wide
and
long
resembling

this

is
a
monotonous

slightly
undulating
its
higher

not
even

to
the

and
eastward
it
descends
gradually
into
the
still
lower
lands
of
east
prussia
and
white

but
in
the
south
it
lifts
into
the
foothills
of
the
carpathian
mountains
gigantic
armies
are
to
move
over
this
plateau
timbered
in
parts
with
oak
beech
and
lime
and
in
some
sections
deeply
cut
by
small
rivers
and
streams
forming
fissures
some
narrow
and
craggy
others
broad
and
sloping
with
marshy
bottoms
toward
the
south
the
soldiers
must
cross
narrow
ravines
in
all
directions
often
covered
with
wild
thick
undergrowth
the
chief
river
is
the
vistula
which
enters
by
the
southern
boundary
and
flows
first
north
then
northwest
skirting
the

at

approaching

the
most
notable
of
which
is
the

almost
feet
above

the
fighting
forces
in
the
northeast
where
the
plain
slopes
gradually
into
the
suwalki
province
must
pass
over
a
country
dotted
with
lakes
and

which
farther
on
take
on
the
character
of
marshes
stagnant
ponds
peat
bogs
with
small
streams
flowing
lazily
from
one
to
the
other
here
and
there
are
patches
of
stunted
pine
forests
with
occasional
stretches
of
fertile
cultivated
soil
throughout
this
section
many
rivers
flow
along
broad
level
valleys
separating
into
various
branches
which
form
many
islands
and
during
the
rainy
seasons
flood
the
surrounding
country
farther
west
the

pass
through
broad
valleys
or

the

here
too
flows
the

miles
in

watering
a

square

and
separating

from

it
advances
northward
in
a
great
winding
pathway
between
limestone

covered
with

or
amid

its

rising
to
high

in

past

in

in
the
yellowish

along
its
banks
grow
rich
crops
of
oats
buckwheat
corn
and
some
rye
naturally
such
a
section
would
be
thickly
populated
not
only
on
account
of
the
fertile
soil
but
because
the
niemen
like
the
vistula
is
one
of
the
country
means
of
communication
and
transportation
as
many
as

earn
their

the

it

in

among

of

that
the
armies
come
into
possession
of

a
fact
which
will
have
some
influence
on
the
german

movements
in

region
up
in

copper
has
been
mined
for
years
though
the

has
decreased

the

further
enhanced
by

spread
from

up
to
the

far
into
the
center
of

ruling
its

peoples
with
quite
as
much
rigor
as
the

have
themselves
been
ruled
by

and
germany
poland
is
a
seat
of
conquest
in
the
great
war
for
not
much
over
a
hundred
years
ago
what
remained
of
this
old
kingdom
was
divided
among
the
three
great
powers
prussia
austria
and
russia
austria
on
the
whole
has
been
much
the
best
master
germany
tried
in
various
ways
to
germanize
her
subjects
in
german
poland
thereby
rousing
their
bitter
hatred
russia
was
no
less
autocratic
in
attempting
to
extinguish
the
spirit
of
nationality
among
the
poles
under
her
rule
but
naturally
the
fact
remains
that
between
the
poles
and
the
russians
there
are
still
ties
of
blood
in
moving
westward
by
this
route
russia
would
be
moving
among
a
race
who
in
spite
of
all
they
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
czar
still
would
naturally
prefer
slav
to
teuton
we
shall
soon
stand
with
the
invading
armies
in
the
center
of
russian
poland
and
enter
the
great
city
of
warsaw
this
conquered
citadel
with
more
than
inhabitants
is
situated
on
the
vistula
it
was
next
to
paris
the
most
brilliant
city
of
europe
in
the
early
part
of
last
century
but
under
russian
influence
it
became
a
provincial
town
in
spirit
if
not
in
size
it
once
had
the
character
of
prodigal
splendor
within
late
years
it
became
a
forlorn
neglected
city
not
the
least
effort
being
made
by
the
russian
authorities
to
modernize
its
appearance
and
improvement
from
a
sanitary
point
of
view
it
became
one
of
the
least
progressive
cities
of
europe
and
yet
as
the
armies
march
into
the
capital
there
are
still
signs
of
the
city
past
glory
over
thirty
palaces
rear
their
lofty
turrets
above
the
tile
roofs
of
the
houses
among
them
the
palace
of
the
polish
kings
however
from
a
military
point
of
view
warsaw
maintained
great
importance
in
the
great
war
it
is
at
this
time
one
of
the
strongest
citadels
of
europe
and
around
it
lies
the
group
of
fortresses
called
the
polish
triangle
the
southern
apex
is
ivangorod
on
the
vistula
the
eastern
the
northern
being
warsaw
itself
to
the
northwest
lies
the
advanced
fort
of
novo
georgievsk
this
triangle
is
a
fortified
region
with
three
fronts
two
toward
germany
and
one
toward
austria
and
the
various
forts
are
fully
connected
by
means
of
railroads
it
would
appear
therefore
that
russian
poland
would
offer
excellent
conditions
for
an
army
on
the
defensive
and
this
is
quite
true
the
vistula
especially
serving
as
a
screen
against
the
attacking
armies
from
the
west
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
to
take
warsaw
by
a
frontal
attack
warsaw
weakness
lay
in
the
north
in
the
swamp
regions
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
in
all
wars
against
which
a
military
commander
has
to
guard
his
army
is
that
of
being
flanked
the
road
or
roads
leading
from
the
rear
to
the
base
of
supplies
along
which
not
only
food
supplies
for
the
soldiers
but
quite
as
important
ammunition
is
brought
up
either
in
wagons
automobiles
or
in
railroad
trains
are
the
most
sensitive
part
of
an
army
situation
unless
they
are
very
short
that
is
unless
an
army
is
very
close
to
its
base
of
supplies
it
is
impossible
to
guard
these
lines
of
communication
adequately
therefore
if
the
enemy
is
able
to
break
through
on
either
side
of
the
front
there
is
great
danger
that
he
may
swing
his
forces
around
and
cut
these
lines
of
communication
the
army
that
is
thus
deprived
of
its
sources
of
supply
has
nothing
left
then
but
to
surrender
sometimes
even
to
inferior
forces
sometimes
of
course
if
the
army
is
within
the
walls
of
a
fortified
city
and
is
well
supplied
with
food
and
ammunition
it
may
hold
out
and
allow
itself
to
be
besieged
this
may
even
be
worth
while
for
the
sake
of
diminishing
the
enemy
strength
to
the
extent
of
the
forces
required
for
besieging
usually
many
times
larger
than
the
besieged
force
but
in
the
case
of
warsaw
we
shall
see
that
that
would
not
have
been
a
wise
plan
hardly
any
food
supply
that
could
have
been
laid
by
would
have
maintained
the
large
civil
population
and
the
big
guns
of
the
germans
would
soon
have
battered
down
the
city
defenses
this
the
russians
realized
from
the
very
beginning
as
is
well
known
now
russia
had
never
intended
to
hold
poland
against
the
teutons
her
real
line
of
defense
was
laid
much
farther
back
it
was
only
on
account
of
the
protest
of
france
when
the
two
governments
entered
into
their
alliance
that
any
fortifications
at
all
were
thrown
up
in
poland
a
real
line
of
defense
must
be
more
or
less
a
straight
line
with
no
break
and
the
marshes
in
the
north
as
well
as
the
tongue
of
east
prussia
projecting
in
along
the
shores
of
the
baltic
toward
riga
made
that
impossible
russia
real
line
of
defense
was
farther
east
along
the
borders
of
russia
proper
and
along
the
line
of
railroad
already
referred
to
by
studying
this
territory
east
of
poland
it
will
become
obvious
why
russia
should
prefer
this
as
her
main
line
of
defense
against
a
german
invasion
as
we
witness
the
armies
moving
along
what
was
once
the
frontier
between
poland
and
russia
proper
we
shall
find
the
plain
of
poland
dips
into
a
region
which
apparently
was
once
a
vast
lake
which
drained
into
the
dnieper
but
the
outlet
becoming
choked
this
stagnant
water
formed
into
those
immense
morasses
known
as
the
pripet
marshes
forming
over
of
the
whole
province
of
minsk
and
covering
an
area
of
over
square
miles
even
when
more
than
acres
have
been
reclaimed
by
drainage
the
armies
found
some
of
these
marshes
extending
continuously
for
over
miles
in
the
upper
pripet
basin
the
woods
were
everywhere
full
of
countless
little
channels
which
creep
through
a
wilderness
of
sedge
along
the
right
bank
of
the
pripet
river
the
land
rises
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
is
fairly
thickly
populated
elsewhere
extends
a
great
intricate
network
of
streams
with
endless
fields
of
bulrushes
and
stunted
woods
over
these
bogs
hang
unhealthy
vapors
and
among
the
rank
reeds
there
is
no
fly
nor
mosquito
nor
living
soul
or
sound
in
the
autumn
not
even
infantry
could
pass
over
this
region
not
to
consider
cavalry
or
artillery
save
in
the
depth
of
a
cold
winter
when
the
water
and
mire
is
frozen
even
then
it
would
be
impossible
to
venture
over
the
ice
with
heavy
guns
an
invading
army
must
therefore
split
in
two
parts
and
pass
around
the
sides
and
nothing
is
more
dangerous
than
splitting
an
army
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
it
is
behind
these
vast
marshes
that
we
shall
find
the
russians
planned
to
make
their
first
determined
stand
here
too
the
russians
expected
to
have
the
advantage
of
being
surrounded
by
their
own
people
for
this
is
the
country
of
the
white
russians
so
called
on
account
of
their
costumes
here
the
purest
slavic
type
is
preserved
they
have
not
blended
with
other
stocks
as
the
great
russians
with
the
finns
and
the
little
russians
farther
south
with
the
mongols
for
a
while
this
territory
was
subject
to
the
kings
of
poland
who
oppressed
its
inhabitants
most
barbarously
from
the
effects
of
which
they
have
not
even
fully
recovered
white
russia
is
one
of
the
poorest
and
most
backward

us

we
have

for
here
there
is
much
less
swaying
back

forth
the

maintaining

more
steadily
than
farther
north
this

is
an

rich

are
grown
here
while
the
mineral
resources
include
coal
salt
and
petroleum
the
latter
especially
being
important
in
modern
warfare
on
account
of
the
great
quantities
of
fuel
necessary
for

carriages
here
in

we
shall
witness

we
shall
see

also
important
as
the
junction
of
the

of

that
the

had
built
throughout
the

including
several
lines
passing
over

costs
as
will
be
noted
by
reading
the
chapters
on
the
fighting
on
the
eastern
front
here
as
in
east
prussia
the
russians
make
a
determined
advance
and
actually
succeed
in
conquering
this
territory
from
the
austrians
at
one
time
we
find
them
even
in
possession
of
all
except
one
of
the
chief
passes
in
the
carpathians
and
threatening
to
overrun
the
plains
of
hungary
to
hold
russian
poland
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
have
a
firm
grip
of
east
prussia
and
austrian
poland
thus
protecting
the
flanks
of
their
center
had
they
been
able
to
hold
their
grip
then
they
could
have
straightened
out
their
entire
line
from
north
to
south
and
warsaw
would
have
been
safe
but
we
shall
see
both
their
extremities
driven
back
therefore
warsaw
was
in
danger
in
spite
of
its
fortifications
that
the
austrians
should
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
thrust
back
over
the
carpathians
is
one
of
the
surprises
of

the

this
survey
of
the
fighting
ground
in
eastern
europe
brings
us
now
to
the
cockpit
of
the
war
from
a
military
point
of
view
as
well
as
from
the
political
the
balkan
theatre
is
of
equal
importance
with
other
big
fronts
in
europe
it
is
the
gateway
to
the
orient
for
central
europe
here
the
armies
engaged
are
numbered
only
by
the
hundred
thousands
none
reach
a
million
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
human
interest
and
political
intrigue
it
is
by
far
the
most
picturesque
here
the
hatred
between
the
combatants
is
most
bitter
indeed
so
bitter
that
when
it
burst
into
flame
a
mad
whirlwind
of
passion
swept
over
half
the
world
for
here
the
great
conflagration
began
a
map
of
the
balkan
peninsula
is
almost
on
the
face
of
it
a
full
explanation
of
the
causes
of
the
war
the
military
campaigns
studied
in
connection
with
their
physical
environment
explain
all
the
diplomatic
intrigues
of
the
past
fifty
years
for
they
are
the
intrigues
themselves
translated
into
action
geographically
speaking
the
balkan
nations
are
those
situated
in
the
big
peninsula
of
southern
europe
which
lies
below
the
danube
river
and
the
northern
border
of
montenegro
some
authorities
however
include
rumania
and
others
even
bring
in
austria
slavic
provinces
bosnia
and
herzegovina
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
this
vast
region
is
its
mountains
those
same
carpathian
mountains
which
form
the
natural
boundary
between
the
land
of
the
magyars
and
the
russian
plains
take
a
sudden
turn
westward
at
the
rumanian
frontier
then
sweep
around
in
a
great
semicircle
forming
a
shape
resembling
a
scythe
the
handle
of
which
reaches
up
into
poland
the
blade
curling
around
within
the
balkan
peninsula
behind
the
handle
and
above
the
upper
part
of
the
blade
stretch
the
broad
plains
of
hungary
through
which
flows
the
great
danube
the
largest
river
in
europe
next
to
the
russian
volga
a
river
which
flowed
with
blood
during
the
great
war
just
in
the
middle
of
the
back
of
the
blade
this
great
river
bursts
through
the
mountain
chain
swirling
through
the
famous
iron
gate
into
the
great
basin
within
the
curved
blade
on
the
south
of
its
farther
course
to
the
black
sea
lie
the
plains
of
northern
bulgaria
the
curving
chain
of
mountains
below
the
iron
gate
is
the
balkan
range
but
excepting
for
the
plains
of
thrace
lying
south
of
the
balkans
over
toward
the
black
sea
and
above
constantinople
the
rest
of
the
peninsula
is
almost
entirely
one
confused
tangle
of
craggy
mountains
interspersed
throughout
with
small
fertile
valleys
and
plateaus
this
roughness
of
surface
becomes
especially
aggravated
as
one
passes
westward
and
over
toward
the
adriatic
coast
from
greece
up
into
the
austrian
province
of
dalmatia
the
country
is
almost
inaccessible
to
ordinary
travelers
what
is
the
political
value
of
this
beleaguered
domain
the
broad
significant
fact
is
that
any
road
from
western
europe
to
the
orient
must
pass
through
the
balkan
peninsula
and
that
these
mountains
almost
block
that
road
from
north
to
south
there
is
just
one
highway
so
narrow
that
it
is
really
a
defile
this
road
stretches
from
the
seat
of
the
war
at
belgrade
on
the
danube
down
a
narrow
valley
the
morava
thence
through
the
highlands
of
macedonia
into
the
vardar
valley
to
saloniki
on
the
ægean
sea
at
nish
above
macedonia
another
road
branches
off
into
bulgaria
across
the
plains
of
thrace
and
into
constantinople
this
was
the
road
by
which
the
crusaders
swarmed
down
to
conquer
the
holy
land
this
was
the
road
by
which
hundreds
of
years
later
the
moslems
swarmed
up
into
the
plains
of
hungary
and
overran
the
south
of
europe
until
they
were
finally
checked
outside
the
gates
of
vienna
nothing
is
more
significant
of
the
terror
that
these
marching
hosts
inspired
than
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
a
few
larger
towns
the
villages
hid
themselves
away
from
this
highway
in
the
hills
bear
clearly
in
mind
that
in
the
existence
of
this
narrow
way
to
the
orient
lies
the
key
not
only
to
the
causes
of
the
war
but
to
the
military
campaigns
that
we
shall
follow
in
this
region
for
it
is
the
teutons
who
would
in
the
great
war
like
the
crusaders
of
old
pass
down
this
highway
and
again
conquer
the
east
though
in
this
case
their
object
is
trade
and
not
the
holy
sepulcher
to
secure
the
pathway
through
this
strategic
country
it
also
is
necessary
to
have
control
of
the
territory
on
all
sides
and
this
is
quite
as
true
in
a
political
as
in
a
military
sense
to
secure
their
pathway
up
into
europe
the
turks
once
conquered
all
the
peoples
in
the
balkans
except
those
inhabiting
the
mountains
over
on
the
adriatic
the
montenegrins
and
a
small
city
called
ragusa
just
above
montenegro
in
dalmatia
it
is
not
at
all
peculiar
that
just
here
in
almost
the
same
locality
the
teutons
should
meet
with
the
first
and
strongest
resistance
a
study
of
the
territory
in
which
the
first
fighting
of
the
war
occurred
will
explain
the
foregoing
calculations
it
will
be
observed
that
austrian
territory
runs
down
past
the
eastward
turn
in
the
danube
along
the
frontier
of
montenegro
until
it
narrows
gradually
into
a
tip
at
cattaro
just
below
cettinje
the
montenegrin
capital
this
land
is
composed
of
the
three
provinces
of
bosnia
herzegovina
and
dalmatia
all
this
territory
is
inhabited
by
the
same
race
that
peoples
serbia
and
montenegro
the
serbs
in
fact
the
slavic
population
reaches
up
all
along
the
coast
to
trieste
and
even
a
little
beyond
for
this
reason
it
is
in
this
direction
that
we
shall
see
the
serbians
and
the
montenegrins
invade
austrian
territory
after
their
initial
success
in
repulsing
the
austrian
invasion
the
objectives
of
the
brief
campaign
soon
to
be
considered
were
sarajevo
the
capital
of
bosnia
and
ragusa
the
famous
little
seaport
on
the
adriatic
ragusa
is
of
especial
interest
on
account
of
its
remarkable
history
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
the
most
important
seaport
in
that
part
of
the
world
its
ships
sailed
over
all
the
mediterranean
and
from
them
is
derived
the
word
argosy
signifying
a
ship
laden
with
wealth
again
and
again
the
turks
attempted
to
conquer
this
little
state
which
was
at
that
time
a
republic
but
always
the
ragusans
beat
off
the
enemy
for
the
country
about
is
so
rocky
so
rough
that
the
city
was
easily
defended
especially
in
that
time
when
nearly
all
fighting
was
hand
to
hand
the
first
and
foremost
word
in
the
great
war
the
key
word
is
sarajevo
here
is
the
scene
of
the
assassination
of
the
crown
prince
of
austria
which
was
at
least
the
final
cause
of
the
war
as
we
enter
it
we
find
a
population
of
about
forty
thousand
half
of
which
are
mohammedans
it
is
a
large
straggling
town
situated
in
a
narrowing
valley
overtopped
by
steep
hills
on
either
side
which
close
in
a
narrow
gorge
in
the
east
and
broaden
into
a
plain
on
the
west
it
was
to
the
eastward
however
that
we
shall
find
the
heavy
fighting
along
the
frontier
the
armies
along
the
danube
will
soon
command
our
attention
as
they
follow
the
river
toward
belgrade
the
capital
of
serbia
it
is
no
longer
the
blue
danube
of
the
famous
german
song
here
in
fact
it
is
a
broad
river
dotted
with
a
number
of
low
islands
along
its
center
belgrade
where
the
first
shots
of
the
war
were
fired
is
located
on
rather
high
ground
backed
by
a
semicircle
of
low
hills
in
its
rear
but
opposite
all
is
flat
and
in
places
marshy
modern
guns
could
of
course
keep
up
an
effective
fire
across
the
river
at
this
point
as
in
fact
they
did
before
the
actual
invasion
of
serbia
began
but
the
conditions
for
a
crossing
are
not
favorable
it
was
from
the
west
from
the
bosnian
side
that
the
actual
attack
was
made
just
below
belgrade
the
river
save
shallower
and
narrower
empties
into
the
danube
forming
the
frontier
westward
past
shabatz
to
ratcha
where
the
drina
flowing
down
from
the
macedonian
highlands
northward
joins
it
forming
the
western
frontier
between
bosnia
and
serbia
the
drina
where
much
fighting
occurs
is
no
ordinary
waterway
no
mere
mountain
stream
though
it
lies
in
a
mountainous
country
before
reaching
its
junction
with
the
save
it
is
fed
by
many
important
tributaries
ever
swift
often
torrential
it
has
washed
out
a
bed
of
imposing
width
and
by
a
constant
cutting
out
of
new
courses
has
created
a
series
of
deltas
it
was
one
of
the
largest
of
these
islands
that
of
kuriachista
between
losnitza
and
leschnitza
that
the
austrians
chose
as
a
base
for
their
first
invasion
from
this
point
up
and
around
to
shabatz
lies
the
bloody
field
of
the
battles
a
description
of
this
section
in
brief
at
least
is
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
the
three
austrian
invasions
made
here
and
all
three
of
which
failed
disastrously
north
and
west
of
shabatz
lies
the
great
plain
of
matchva
bounded
on
its
east
and
north
by
the
save
and
by
the
drina
on
the
west
it
is
a
rich
fertile
land
but
much
broken
up
by
woodland
to
the
southeast
a
rolling
valley
is
divided
by
the
river
dobrava
while
due
south
the
tzer
mountains
rise
like
a
camel
back
out
of
the
plain
and
stretch
right
across
from
the
drina
to
the
dobrava
the
southern
slopes
of
tzer
are
less
abrupt
than
those
on
the
north
and
descend
gradually
into
the
leschnitza
valley
out
of
which
rise
the
lesser
heights
of
the
iverak
mountains
both
these
ranges
are
largely
covered
by
prune
orchards
intersected
with
some
sparse
timber
this
is
a
region
of
natural
fortifications
descending
southward
again
the
foothills
of
iverak
are
lost
in
a
chain
of
summits
which
flank
the
right
bank
of
the
jadar
river
that
tributary
of
the
drina
river
from
which
the
first
big
battle
takes
its
name
from
the
left
bank
of
the
jadar
from
its
junction
with
the
drina
to
jarebitze
a
great
rolling
level
stretches
south
until
the
high
guchevo
mountains
stretching
in
southeasterly
direction
rise
abruptly
and
hide
the
bosnian
hills
from
view
from
there
southward
the
country
is
extremely
mountainous
even
the
highways
being
blasted
out
of
the
sides
of
the
precipitous
mountains
along
the
innumerable
ravines
through
which
run
watercourses
which
though
almost
dry
in
summer
burst
into
torrential
streams
after
the
snows
begin
to
melt
in
the
higher
altitudes
naturally
in
such
a
country
roads
are
of
prime
importance
in
military
operations
a
few
built
and
maintained
by
the
state
are
in
excellent
condition
and
practicable
in
all
sorts
of
weather
but
for
the
rest
communications
consist
of
bridle
paths
and
trails
over
the
mountains
as
has
been
stated
the
great
highway
from
belgrade
to
saloniki
is
the
key
to
all
military
operations
in
the
balkans
nor
is
this
case
any
exception
a
study
of
the
map
will
show
how
this
big
underlying
fact
entered
into
the
plans
of
the
first
three
attempts
at
invading
serbia
naturally
had
facilities
been
convenient
at
belgrade
that
would
have
been
the
point
from
which
to
advance
the
next
possible
point
was
over
the
drina
because
it
was
not
so
wide
or
so
deep
bosnia
and
herzegovina
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
were
sparsely
served
by
railroads
but
for
the
purpose
of
an
invasion
of
serbia
the
lines
running
to
tuzla
in
the
north
and
to
vishegrade
and
uvatz
in
the
south
were
of
much
strategic
importance
moreover
unlike
the
hungarian
plain
opposite
belgrade
the
country
is
so
mountainous
and
well
wooded
that
great
bodies
of
troops
could
be
moved
about
without
being
observed
we
now
come
to
the
main
reason
why
this
point
was
chosen
next
to
belgrade
though
we
shall
see
that
they
did
not
reach
it
at
their
first
attempt
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
main
objective
of
the
austrians
was
the
little
town
of
valievo
lying
some
distance
back
from
the
jadar
and
the
field
of
battle
for
at
valievo
is
the
terminus
of
a
light
railway
which
joins
with
the
main
line
running
from
belgrade
down
to
saloniki
the
teutons
were
in
a
hurry
to
open
this
highway
for
it
meant
opening
a
means
of
communication
with
the
turks
who
were
to
become
and
later
did
become
their
active
allies
these
are
political
matters
of
significance
here
insomuch
as
they
explain
the
special
importance
of
the
railway
from
belgrade
south
along
the
ancient
highway
of
the
crusaders
before
following
this
route
farther
south
a
few
words
should
be
devoted
to
montenegro
between
serbia
and
montenegro
lies
the
sanjak
of
novibazar
this
small
territory
nominally
belonged
to
turkey
before
the
balkan
war
but
it
was
in
fact
garrisoned
by
austrian
troops
the
civil
administration
being
left
to
the
turks
austria
had
gone
to
special
trouble
to
establish
this
arrangement
so
that
it
might
have
a
wedge
between
the
territories
of
the
two
little
serb
nations
anticipating
this
war
long
ago
austria
had
counted
on
having
a
large
enough
force
in
novibazar
to
prevent
a
union
of
the
two
armies
but
when
it
actually
came
she
was
in
no
position
to
prevent
it
so
much
of
her
strength
being
required
to
meet
the
russians
montenegro
is
the
natural
refuge
of
the
serbs
whenever
in
the
past
they
were
especially
hard
pressed
by
the
turks
they
would
flee
to
the
mountain
fastnesses
of
tzherna
gora
the
black
mountain
for
here
military
operations
even
in
this
day
of
modern
artillery
are
absolutely
impossible
and
when
it
came
to
mountain
guerrilla
fighting
the
turks
were
no
match
for
the
serbs
thus
it
was
that
the
serbs
were
able
to
preserve
their
old
traditions
their
language
and
the
best
blood
of
their
race
and
it
may
be
said
that
to
a
slightly
lesser
extent
ragusa
served
the
same
purpose
the
montenegrins
are
born
fighters
and
die
fighters
from
one
end
to
the
other
montenegro
is
one
wilderness
of
mountain
crags
and
towering
precipices
traversed
only
by
foot
trails
here
and
there
a
shelf
of
level
soil
may
be
found
just
enough
to
enable
people
to
grow
their
own
necessities
the
capital
of
this
rocky
domain
high
up
among
the
crags
and
overlooking
the
adriatic
is
cettinje
which
was
to
be
stormed
and
conquered
by
the
teutons
the
main
street
about
yards
long
comprising
of
the
town
is
so
broad
that
three
or
four
carriages
may
be
driven
abreast
down
the
length
of
it
it
is
composed
entirely
of
one
and
two
story
cottages
a
few
short
streets
branch
off
at
right
angles
and
in
these
is
all
of
cettinje
that
is
not
comprised
in
the
main
street
the
king
inhabited
a
brown
edifice
with
a
small
garden
attached
overlooking
the
capital
is
mt
lovcen
on
top
of
which
the
montenegrins
planted
guns
to
defend
any
attack
that
might
be
made
against
them
south
of
montenegro
and
north
of
greece
lies
another
country
of
instinctive
fighters
it
is
similar
in
physical
aspect
but
very
different
in
its
population
this
is
the
land
of
the
albanians
whom
the
turks
conquered
by
force
of
arms
like
all
the
rest
of
the
balkan
peninsula
they
are
a
distinct
race
by
themselves
it
is
supposed
that
they
are
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
illyrians
those
wild
tribes
of
whom
the
ancient
greeks
wrote
nor
is
this
unlikely
for
in
such
a
country
as
theirs
the
inhabitants
are
most
likely
to
remain
pure
from
generation
to
generation
returning
for
a
few
moments
to
belgrade
we
now
may
resume
our
course
down
the
ancient
highway
toward
saloniki
down
the
morava
valley
passes
the
railroad
after
which
it
passes
within
a
few
miles
of
the
bulgarian
frontier
near
kustendil
dangerously
near
the
frontier
of
a
possible
enemy
but
especially
perilous
in
this
war
in
which
the
serbians
would
naturally
endeavor
to
retreat
toward
her
ally
greece
just
below
vranya
the
railroad
enters
what
was
before
the
two
balkan
wars
the
turkish
territory
of
macedonia
this
region
down
to
within
sixty
miles
of
saloniki
was
reconquered
from
the
turks
by
the
serbs
having
been
serb
inhabited
since
early
in
the
christian
era
as
shown
by
historical
record
as
early
as
constantin
porphyrogenitus
writes
of
its
inhabitants
as
serbs
from
whom
he
says
the
town
of
serbia
on
the
bistritza
river
near
saloniki
took
its
name
throughout
this
region
there
are
so
many
mountain
ranges
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
name
them
all
nowhere
has
blood
been
more
continuously
shed
than
here
and
nowhere
in
europe
is
the
scenery
more
beautiful
especially
impressive
is
that
section
around
monastir
toward
the
frontier
of
albania
and
away
from
the
main
line
of
the
railroad
here
not
more
than
a
day
walk
from
the
city
of
monastir
or
bitolia
as
its
slavic
inhabitants
call
it
is
lake
prespa
a
small
sheet
of
water
in
which
are
reflected
the
peaks
and
the
rugged
crags
of
the
surrounding
mountains
through
a
subterranean
passage
the
waters
of
this
mountain
lake
pass
under
the
range
that
separates
it
from
the
much
larger
lake
ochrida
the
source
of
the
bloody
drina
the
people
of
these
mountains
are
serbs
almost
to
saloniki
uskub
whose
ancient
serb
name
is
skoplya
was
the
old
serb
capital
and
there
the
serb
ruler
doushan
was
crowned
emperor
in
for
the
past
five
hundred
years
these
macedonians
have
been
used
to
all
the
ways
of
guerrilla
fighting
roaming
through
their
mountains
in
small
bands
they
have
harassed
the
turkish
soldiers
continuously
the
bulgarian
ruler
ferdinand
had
through
many
years
by
means
of
committees
and
church
jugglery
striven
to
bulgarize
this
population
preparatory
to
the
contemplated
seizure
of
the
territory
which
he
has
now
been
able
with
the
help
of
the
germanic
powers
to
accomplish
but
in
reality
the
bulgar
population
in
what
was
european
turkey
was
found
only
eastward
of
the
struma
in
thracia
including
adrianople
those
regions
formed
the
ample
and
legitimate
field
of
ambition
for
the
unification
of
the
bulgars
when
hostilities
broke
out
in
when
serbia
was
defending
herself
against
the
austrians
king
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
the
secret
ally
by
treaty
of
austria
did
everything
possible
to
forward
his
designs
against
the
serbs
and
sent
armed
bulgar
bands
into
serb
macedonia
shortly
below
the
city
of
monastir
in
the
west
begins
the
greek
frontier
running
over
eastward
to
doiran
where
it
touches
the
bulgarian
frontier
here
the
railroad
coming
down
along
the
vardar
river
emerges
into
the
swamp
lands
and
over
them
passes
into
the
city
of
saloniki
here
is
the
old
territory
of
philip
of
macedon
the
father
of
the
conqueror
for
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
these
swamps
stretch
out
from
saloniki
overshadowed
by
mt
olympus
on
their
southern
edge
while
not
quite
so
extensive
as
the
pinsk
swamps
they
are
quite
as
impassable
from
a
military
point
of
view
in
the
center
of
this
region
of
bulrushes
and
stunted
forests
is
an
open
sheet
of
shallow
water
lake
enedjee
nearly
all
this
swamp
land
is
submerged
but
here
and
there
are
small
islands
for
some
years
the
turkish
soldiers
garrisoned
these
islands
during
the
mild
winter
months
living
on
them
in
rush
huts
in
the
summer
they
would
withdraw
into
the
foothills
but
one
summer
several
hundred
comitajis
descended
into
the
swamps
and
took
possession
the
stunted
forests
and
the
bulrushes
here
are
traversed
by
a
maze
of
narrow
waterways
just
wide
enough
for
a
punt
to
pass
along
when
the
soldiers
returned
in
the
fall
they
started
out
for
their
islands
in
strings
of
punts
presently
they
were
met
by
volleys
of
bullets
that
seemed
to
come
from
all
directions
out
of
the
bulrushes
some
in
their
panic
leaped
out
into
the
shallow
water
and
sunk
in
the
mire
the
rest
retired
for
years
the
turkish
soldiers
attempted
to
drive
the
comitajis
out
of
the
swamp
first
they
surrounded
it
watching
all
possible
landing
places
but
the
outlaws
had
supplies
smuggled
in
to
them
by
the
peasants
then
the
turks
began
bombarding
with
heavy
cannon
which
of
course
was
futile
since
they
could
not
distinguish
the
points
at
which
they
were
firing
and
finally
they
gave
up
molesting
the
comitajis
who
continued
making
the
swamps
their
headquarters
until
the
young
turks
came
into
power
then
believing
that
a
constitutional
macedonia
was
finally
to
be
granted
them
all
the
comitajis
laid
down
their
arms
it
is
a
peculiar
fact
that
saloniki
one
of
the
largest
cities
on
the
peninsula
with
a
population
considerably
over
a
hundred
thousand
should
represent
none
of
the
national
elements
of
the
country
for
though
bulgars
turks
greeks
and
serbs
may
be
found
there
an
overwhelming
majority
nearly
of
the
people
are
spanish
jews
walking
along
the
streets
it
would
be
easy
to
imagine
oneself
in
spain
or
in
mexico
on
all
sides
the
shouts
of
peddlers
the
cries
of
cabmen
the
conversation
of
pedestrians
are
in
spanish
with
a
knowledge
of
that
language
the
stranger
may
make
his
way
about
as
easily
as
in
his
own
native
country
these
are
the
descendants
of
the
jews
who
were
driven
out
of
spain
by
torquemada
and
his
spanish
inquisition
and
were
so
hospitably
received
by
the
sultan
of
turkey
saloniki
where
we
shall
witness
severe
battles
is
situated
at
the
head
of
the
gulf
by
the
same
name
an
inlet
of
the
ægean
sea
it
is
a
city
built
on
the
water
edge
but
surrounding
it
is
high
land
commanding
the
surrounding
country
added
to
that
the
swamp
region
is
another
protection
from
an
enemy
coming
from
inland
its
seaward
forts
however
are
or
were
obsolete
and
would
probably
crumble
before
the
fire
of
modern
naval
guns
stretching
down
the
eastern
shore
of
the
gulf
is
a
peninsula
on
which
is
the
famous
mt
athos
that
very
peculiar
community
of
celibate
monks
here
in
the
holy
mountain
as
the
slavs
call
it
there
are
monasteries
representing
all
the
various
denominations
of
the
greek
orthodox
church
greek
bulgarian
serbian
and
russian
each
swarming
with
hundreds
of
monks
who
pass
their
time
in
idleness
not
only
are
women
forbidden
to
enter
this
domain
but
even
female
dogs
or
cats
are
kept
out
across
this
upper
end
of
the
ægean
from
mt
athos
is
the
bulgarian
port
dedeagatch
to
which
runs
a
branch
of
the
main
railway
from
sofia
to
constantinople
the
country
here
is
low
and
swampy
the
port
itself
being
little
more
than
a
boat
landing
just
below
this
point
across
the
gulf
of
saros
is
the
peninsula
of
gallipoli
where
a
critical
phase
of
the
war
was
fought
it
is
somewhat
like
the
blade
of
a
scimitar
covering
the
entrance
to
the
sea
of
marmora
between
this
strip
of
land
and
the
coast
of
asia
minor
is
a
narrow
strait
the
outer
mouth
of
which
is
called
the
dardanelles
the
inner
gateway
being
the
famous
hellespont
here
it
was
that
xerxes
crossed
over
on
a
bridge
of
boats
at
the
head
of
his
persian
army
to
invade
greece
only
to
meet
disaster
at
thermopylæ
and
here
alexander
of
macedonia
crossed
over
to
begin
his
march
of
conquest
which
was
to
extend
his
power
as
far
as
india
and
about
this
narrow
strait
is
centered
the
ancient
greek
myth
about
hero
and
leander
which
inspired
byron
to
swim
across
from
asia
to
europe
how
well
the
turks
have
fortified
this
approach
to
their
capital
is
well
enough
indicated
in
the
story
of
the
operations
of
the
allied
fleets
in
their
attempt
to
force
the
passage
from
the
hellespont
to
constantinople
is
a
sail
of
forty
miles
along
a
coast
steep
and
rugged
destitute
of
any
harbor
or
even
a
beach
where
a
boat
might
land
nor
is
there
a
more
beautiful
sight
than
that
which
is
presented
on
approaching
the
turkish
capital
from
this
direction
especially
of
an
early
morning
against
the
dawn
in
the
east
are
silhouetted
the
minarets
and
domes
and
the
palace
roofs
of
the
city
then
as
the
light
increases
the
white
buildings
are
distinguished
more
clearly
through
a
purple
mist
that
rises
from
the
waters
until
the
ship
enters
the
bosphorus
gliding
past
the
shipping
and
the
boat
traffic
along
the
shore
of
the
harbor
the
beauties
of
the
bosphorus
have
been
described
in
every
book
of
travel
that
has
ever
included
this
section
of
the
world
in
its
descriptions
it
is
undoubtedly
the
most
beautiful
waterway
that
may
be
found
in
any
country
emerging
into
the
black
sea
from
the
bosphorus
one
strikes
the
bulgarian

not
far
above
that
neck
of
land
on
which
constantinople
is
built
along
this
stretch
of
coast
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
danube
there
are
two
harbors
varna
and
burgas
each
is
terminus
of
a
branch
railroad
leading
off
from
the
line
behind
burgas
lie
the
level
tracts
of
eastern
rumelia
or
thrace
as
that
part
of
the
country
is
still
called
but
varna
is
above
the
point
where
the
balkan
range
strikes
the
coast
all
of
which
is
steep
and
rocky
above
varna
begins
the
delta
of

up
which
steamers
and
heavily

sail
continuously
but
here
also
begins
the
neutral

chapter
xlv
the

the
barred
door
we
now
come
to
that
section
of
the
eastern
theatre
of
the
war
which
received
the
least
extended
notice
in
printed
reports
the
barred
doorway
between
europe
and
asia
the
caucasus
not
because
the
fighting
there
was
less
furious
but
because
the
region
was
less
accessible
to
war
correspondents
the
struggle
was
in
fact
quite
as
bloody
and
even
more
savage
and
barbarous
here
than
elsewhere
for
on
this
front
russ
meets
turk
christian
meets
moslem
and
where
they
grapple
the
veneer
of
chivalry
blisters
off
here
again
as
in
galicia
we
come
to
a
natural
frontier
not
only
between
two
races
but
between
two
continents
for
here
crossing
the
isthmus
between
the
black
sea
and
the
caspian
stretches
a
mountain
range
over
seven
hundred
miles
in
length
rising
abruptly
out
of
the
plains
on
either
side
these
are
the
caucasus
mountains
forming
the
boundary
between
europe
and
asia
the
higher
and
central
part
of
the
range
which
averages
only
from
sixty
to
seventy
miles
in
width
is
formed
of
parallel
ridges
not
separated
by
deep
and
wide
valleys
but
remarkably
connected
by
elevated
plateaus
which
are
traversed
by
narrow
fissures
of
extreme
depth
the
highest
peaks
are
in
the
most
central
chain
mt
elburz
attaining
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
sea
while
mt
kasbeck
reaches
a
height
of
more
than
feet
and
several
other
peaks
rise
above
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
the
outlying
spurs
and
foothills
of
this
chain
of
lofty
mountains
are
of
less
extent
and
importance
than
those
of
almost
any
other
mountain
range
of
similar
magnitude
subsiding
as
they
do
until
they
are
only
feet
high
along
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
some
parts
are
almost
entirely
bare
but
other
parts
are
densely
wooded
and
the
secondary
ranges
near
the
black
sea
are
covered
by
magnificent
forests
of
oak
beech
ash
maple
and
walnut
this
range
is
an
almost
impassable
wall
across
the
narrow
isthmus
which
joins
europe
and
asia
and
the
gorge
of
dariel
is
the
gateway
in
this
wall
through
which
have
come
almost
all
the
migrating
races
that
have
peopled
the
continent
of
europe
as
is
well
known
the
white
peoples
of
europe
have
been
classified
as
the
caucasian
race
because
they
were
all
supposed
to
have
passed
through
this
gateway
originally
apparently
each
of
these
oncoming
waves
of
barbaric
humanity
bursting
through
the
great
gateway
must
have
left
behind
some
few
remnants
of
their
volume
for
nowhere
in
the
world
in
so
limited
an
area
is
there
such
a
diversity
and
mixture
of
peoples
in
the
words
of
one
writer
who
speaks
with
authority
on
this
region
the
caucasus
is
an
ethnological
museum
where
the
invaders
of
europe
as
they
traveled
westward
to
be
manufactured
into
nations
left
behind
samples
of
themselves
in
their
raw
condition
here
may
be
found
the
georgians
who
so
long
championed
the
cross
against
the
crescent
the
wild
lesghians

one
of
the
outstanding
features
of
russian
occupation
is
the
great
georgian
military
road
which
has
been
built
across
the
mountains
of
recent
years
and
maintained
by
the
government
its
engineering
is
masterly
here
and
there
it
passes
close
to
or
under
vast
overhanging
lumps
of
mountainside
everywhere
the
greatest
care
has
been
taken
of
this
most
important
military
highway
russia
avenue
into
that
country
she
coveted
and
fought
for
so
long
beginning
at
vladikavkaz
it
runs
through
balta
lars
thence
through
the
famous
gorge
of
dariel
the
circassian
gates
the
dark
and
awful
defile
between
europe
and
asia
the
gorge
is
what
the
geologists
call
a
fault
for
it
is
not
really
a
pass
over
the
mountain
chain
but
a
rent
clear
across
it
seventy
years
ago
it
was
almost
impassable
for
avalanches
or
the
sudden
outbursts
of
glacial
streams
swept
it
from
end
to
end
but
the
russians
have
spent
over
on
it
and
made
it
safe
in
during
the
war
nearly
all
the
troops
and
stores
for
carrying
the
war
into
turkey
and
asia
came
by
this
road
its
importance
has
since
been
lessened
to
a
certain
degree
for
there
is
now
direct
railway
communication
from
moscow
to
baku
at
one
end
of
the
railway
and
therefore
to
kars
itself
via
tiflis
and
equally
from
batum
to
kars
at
the
other
end
to
which
military
steamers
can
bring
troops
and
supplies
from
odessa
and
novorossik
in
the
black
sea
the
most
important
city
in
this
region
is
tiflis
the
city
of
seventy
languages
it
may
indeed
be
called
the
modern
babel
as
seen
from
the
mountains
it
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
brown
treeless
valley
between
steep
hills
on
either
side
of
the
river
kura
it
is
a
point
of
great
importance
to
modern
russia
it
forms
to
begin
with
the
end
of
the
great
military
road
across
the
mountains
which
in
spite
of
the
railways
is
still
the
quickest
way
to
europe
for
an
army
as
well
as
for
travelers
and
all
the
mails
come
over
it
by
express
coaches
from
tiflis
a
railway
runs
to
kars
a
strong
frontier
on
the
persian
frontier
tiflis
has
been
much
developed
under
the
russian
government
in
the
modern
section
of
the
city
the
streets
are
wide
and
paved
and
lighted
by
electricity
and
the
stores
are
large
and
handsome
while
electric
railways
run
in
all
directions
in
the
older
parts
of
the
city
however
the
houses
remain
as
they
were
built
centuries
ago
divided
out
into
the
many
quarters
devoted
to
the
residences
of
the
many
races
and
nationalities
that
compose
the
population
of
tiflis
between
most
of
them
is
bitter
enmity
and
prejudice
even
among
those
of
the
two
great
religious
faiths
christians
and
mohammedans
it
is
this
diversity
of
interests
which
extends
throughout
all
the
section
down
into
persia
which
has
so
complicated
the
situation
on
this
front
for
not
only
are
the
two
military
forces
fighting
here
but
wherever
governmental
authority
is
momentarily
relaxed
there
these
mutual
animosities
flare
up
into
active
expression
and
the
most
barbarous
features
of
warfare
take
place
such
as
the
massacres
of
the
armenians
by
the
mohammedans
neither
turkey
nor
russia
has
been
especially
eager
to
suppress
these
bitter
feuds
even
in
time
of
peace
in
time
of
war
there
is
nothing
to
restrain
them
and
the
whole
region
is
swept
by
carnage
infinitely
more
hideous
than
legitimate
warfare
we
have
now
passed
over
the
entire
theatre
of
the
battles
on
the
eastern
frontiers
of
the
war
in
europe
the
battle
grounds
are
familiar
to
us
in
the
succeeding
chapters
we
will
follow
the
armies
over
this
dominion
and
watch
the
battle
lines
as
they
move
through
the

to
its
decisive

serbia
situation
and
resources
the
first
great
campaign
on
the
southeastern
battle
grounds
of
the
great
war
began
on
july
when
the
austrian
troops
undertook
their
first
invasion
of
serbia
they
crossed
the
serbian
border
at
mitrovitza
about
fifty
miles
northwest
of
belgrade
driving
the
serbians
before
them
the
first
real
hostilities
of
the
war
opened
with
the
bombardment
of
belgrade
by
the
austrians
on
july
six
days
before
the
beginning
of
the
campaigns
on
the
western
battle
fields
we
are
now
familiar
with
the
theatre
of
war
as
described
in
the
preceding
chapters
and
will
now
follow
the
first
austrian
armies
into
serbia
a
stubborn
fight
excites
the
admiration
of
all
observers
regardless
of
the
moral
qualities
of
the
combatants
so
wherever
our
sympathies
may
lie
considering
the
war
as
a
whole
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
defense
which
the
serbians
made
against
the
first
efforts
of
the
austrians
to
invade
their
country
will
stand
out
in
the
early
history
of
the
war
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
episodes
of
that
period
of
the
general
struggle
like
a
mighty
tidal
wave
from
the
ocean
the
austrian
hosts
swept
over
the
serbian
frontier
in
three
furious
successive
onslaughts
only
to
be
beaten
back
each
time
naturally
there
were
material
and
moral
causes
aside
from
the
mere
valor
of
the
serbians
which
combined
to
create
this
disaster
for
the
austrian
forces
but
enough
of
the
human
element
enters
into
the
military
activities
of
these
campaigns
to
make
them
easily
the
most
picturesque
of
the
early
period
of
the
war
before
entering
into
a
description
of
the
actual
events
in
it
is
well
to
consider
the
forces
engaged
from
a
material
point
of
view
the
serbians
entered
into
these
campaigns
greatly
handicapped
they
had
lately
been
through
two
wars
in
the
first
balkan
war
they
had
not
it
is
true
been
severely
tested
the
weight
of
the
fighting
had
been
borne
by
the
bulgarians
in
thrace
the
real
test
and
the
great
losses
came
only
with
the
second
war
when
the
serbian
army
threw
every
fiber
of
its
strength
against
the
bulgarians
in
the
battle
of
the
bregalnitza
one
of
the
most
stubborn
struggles
in
military
history
the
result
was
a
serbian
victory
but
it
was
very
far
from
being
a
decisive
and
conclusive
victory
the
bulgarians
were
forced
back
some
fifteen
miles
into
their
own
territory
but
had
it
not
been
for
the
intervention
of
rumania
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
serbs
would
have
entered
sofia
here
it
was
that
the
serbians
lost
killed
and
wounded
of
their
best
men
as
against
killed
and
wounded
in
the
whole
war
with
turkey
a
total
loss
that
was
bound
to
be
felt
a
few
months
later
when
the
struggle
was
to
be
against
so
powerful
an
adversary
as
the
two
previous
wars
had
without
exaggeration
deprived
the
serbian
fighting
forces
of
their
number
a
tenth
that
was
of
the
very
best
of
troops
illustration
pictorial
map
of
the
balkans
added
to
this
was
another
serious
handicap
possibly
even
more
serious
serbia
had
indeed
emerged
victorious
from
the
two
wars
with
a
large
stretch
of
conquered
territory
at
her
backdoor
but
this
acquired
territory
practically
all
of
macedonia
that
had
not
gone
to
greece
was
peopled
by
serbs
for
years
these
macedonians
had
been
organized
into
revolutionary
fighting
bands
the
macedonian
committee
for
the
liberation
of
macedonia
and
albania
from
the
turks
and
had
struggled
not
only
against
the
turks
but
against
foreign
armed
bands
of
propagandists
some
eight
years
subsequently
to
the
foundation
of
the
macedonian
committee
of
native
origin
the
bulgars
founded
in
their
committee
which
was
called
the
committee
during
the
first
balkan
war
these
experienced
guerrilla
fighters
were
valuable
allies
to
the
serbian
forces
operating
against
the
turks
but
even
before
the
first
balkan
war
the
serbians
had
very
distinctly
given
the
macedonians
to
understand
that
they
were
to
remain
serbian
subjects
this
action
on
their
part
had
had
not
a
little
to
do
with
rousing
the
bulgarians
to
precipitate
the
second
balkan
war
and
when
finally
serbia
conquered
all
this
territory
confirmed
to
her
down
to
doiran
by
the
treaty
of
bucharest
king
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
began
at
once
a
fiery
propaganda
throughout
the
world
and
took
measures
through
provocatory
agents
and
bulgar
bands
crossing
from
bulgaria
into
macedonia
to
create
disturbances
when
the
great
war
broke
out
in
july
this
bulgarian
activity
in
serb
macedonia
grew
more
intense
thus
it
was
that
when
the
austrians
attacked
the
serbians
on
their
front
the
serbians
had
still
to
detach
enough
of
their
forces
to
guard
the
border
to
prevent
the
crossing
into
serb
macedonia
of
bulgar
bands
and
added
to
this
was
the
danger
from
bulgaria
herself
the
serbians
knew
that
the
opportune
moment
had
only
to
come
and
bulgaria
too
would
hurl
herself
on
the
serbian
eastern
flank
thus
another
large
percentage
of
the
serbian
fighting
forces
had
also
to
be
stationed
along
the
bulgarian
frontier
to
guard
against
possible
attack
from
that
quarter
offsetting
these
handicaps
however
and
more
than
equalizing
them
was
the
moral
strength
of
the
serbian
fighting
units
they
had
just
emerged
through
two
victorious
wars
they
had
triumphed
so
completely
that
there
was
small
wonder
if
the
serbian
farmers
had
come
to
believe
themselves
invincible
and
their
leaders
infallible
practically
every
man
in
the
serbian
army
was
a
seasoned
veteran
he
had
had
not
only
his
baptism
of
fire
but
he
had
been
through
some
of
the
bloodiest
battles
of
modern
times
he
had
got
over
his
first
fright
he
was
in
that
state
of
mind
where
danger
and
bloodshed
no
longer
inspired
either
fear
or
horror
and
even
the
warlike
savage
trembles
on
entering
his
first
battle
finally
he
was
now
defending
his
country
his
home
his
very
fireside
and
his
family
against
foreign
invasion
and
it
is
generally
admitted
that
a
man
fighting
in
that
situation
is
equal
to
two
invaders
all
other
things
being
equal
the
serb
army
opposing
the
austrian
invasions
was
composed
of
ten
divisions
of
the
first
ban
and
five
divisions
of
the
second
ban
five
of
the
divisions
of
the
first
ban
and
the
five
of
the
second
came
from
the
kingdom
as
it
was
prior
to
the
two
balkan
wars
but
the
second
five
divisions
of
the
first
ban
were
new
creations
recruited
from
serb
macedonia
the
principles
on
which
the
organization
of
the
serbian
army
was
based
were
very
simple
the
former
kingdom
was
divided
into
five
territorial
divisional
districts
nish
valievo
belgrade
kragujevatz
and
zaitchar
each
of
these
territorial
divisional
districts
was
subdivided
into
four
regimental
recruiting
districts
each
of
which
provided
one
infantry
regiment
of
four
battalions
and
one
depot
battalion
the
battalion
numbered
about
a
thousand
men
so
that
the
war
strength
of
the
divisional
infantry
amounted
to
about
men
attached
to
each
division
was
a
regiment
of
artillery
consisting
of
three
groups
of
three
batteries
in
all
guns
the
divisional
cavalry
existing
only
in
war
time
consisted
of
a
regiment
of
four
squadrons
from
men
and
horses
previously
registered
to
each
division
was
also
attached
its
own
technical
and
administrative
units
engineers
and
supply
column
and
its
total
strength
amounted
to
officers
and
men
of
troops
in
addition
to
these
five
divisions
of
the
first
ban
there
was
also
a
regiment
of
mountain
artillery
made
up
of
six
batteries
six
howitzer
batteries
and
two
battalions
of
fortress
artillery
then
there
was
a
separate
cavalry
division
composed
of
two
brigades
each
of
two
regiments
its
war
strength
was
officers
and
men
attached
to
the
cavalry
division
were
two
horse
artillery
batteries
of
eight
guns
each
all
told
this
army
numbered
about
with
about
sabers
and
guns
illustration
serbian
and
austrian
invasions
the
second
ban
or
reserve
much
inferior
in
armament
to
the
first
line
brought
the
strength
up
to
about
men
but
this
figure
is
probably
an
underestimate
volunteers
were
enrolled
in
immense
numbers
some
of
them
were
men
who
had
been
exempted
in
the
first
conscription
others
were
serbs
from
austrian
territory
the
united
states
sent
back
thousands
of
austrian
and
macedonian
serbs
who
had
emigrated
there
it
is
probable
therefore
that
the
total
strength
of
the
serbian
forces
shortly
after
the
war
broke
out
was
at
least
if
not
a
trifle
more
to
this
must
be
added
the
montenegrin
army
which
though
operating
in
a
separate
field
contributed
its
share
in
driving
the
austrians
back
another
men
of
fighting
ability
and
experience
finally
there
was
the
third
reserve
another
men
but
they
could
be
used
for
fighting
only
in
the
gravest
emergency
the
infantry
of
the
first
ban
was
armed
with
excellent
mauser
rifles
caliber
model
the
second
ban
carried
a
mauser
the
old
single
loader
to
which
a
magazine
was
fitted
in
the
serbian
arsenals
while
the
third
ban
had
the
old
berdan
rifle
the
machine
gun
carried
was
the
maxim
of
the
same
caliber
as
the
new
mauser
in
artillery
the
serbians
were
perhaps
not
so
well
off
their
cannons
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
service
in
the
balkan
wars
and
the
larger
a
piece
of
artillery
the
more
limited
is
the
number
of
rounds
it
can
fire
it
is
extremely
doubtful
that
there
had
been
time
to
replace
many
of
these
pieces
the
field
gun
was
of
french
make
it
was
a
quick
firer
with
a
maximum
range
for
shrapnel
of
yards
a
little
over
miles
the
second
ban
was
armed
with
old
de
bange
guns
of
cm
caliber
the
heavy
guns
which
had
done
much
service
outside
adrianople
were
of
creuzot
make

included
howitzers
of

some
mortars

when

austria
strength
and
strategy
let
us
now
review
the
austrian
forces
that
participated
in
the
invasions
of
serbia
in
number
they
were
practically
unlimited
at
least
they
far
outnumbered
the
serbian
forces
that
met
them
in
the
field
their
armament
was
of
the
best
and
their
equipment
as
complete
as
boundless
resources
could
make
it
they
were
however
partly
made
up
of
the
peoples
of
the
slavic
provinces
of
austria
bohemians
croatians
dalmatians
and
bosnians
naturally
there
could
be
but
little
enthusiasm
in
their
attacks
on
their
brother
slavs
and
while
there
are
many
mutual
animosities
between
these
various
branches
of
the
slavic
race
such
feelings
are
at
any
rate
secondary
to
the
general
dislike
of
the
schwabs
as
the
are
called
and
the
magyars
possibly
this
had
much
to
do
with
the
austrian
defeats
the
hungarian
or
magyar
regiments
were
probably
in
the
majority
but
the
magyars
from
the
interior
of
hungary
have
no
special
reason
to
hate
the
serbians
and
aside
from
that
they
were
attacking
on
foreign
soil
at
the
head
of
the
austrian
campaigns
against
serbia
was
general
potiorek
generally
described
as
a
textbook
strategist
but
just
how
much
his
failures
were
due
to
his
own
inefficiency
and
how
much
to
the
inefficiency
of
those
under
him
will
probably
never
be
determined
he
had
in
the
end
to
suffer
for
both
these
were
the
two
great
contending
forces
that
were
set
in
motion
by
the
departure
of
baron
giesl
the
minister
from
belgrade
on
july
on
the
same
day
the
prince
regent
alexander
signed
a
decree
ordering
the
general
mobilization
of
the
serbian
army
three
days
later
on
july
austria
declared
war
by
that
time
serbia
was
in
the
midst
of
her
mobilization
that
the
austrians
who
had
the
advantage
of
having
taken
the
initiative
and
who
had
presumably
chosen
their
own
time
for
the
opening
of
hostilities
did
not
immediately
take
full
advantage
of
their
favorable
situation
has
caused
much
surprise
among
impartial
military
critics
on
the
same
day
that
they
declared
war
they
had
the
opportunity
to
hurl
their
troops
across
the
danube
and
take
belgrade
with
practically
no
opposition
apparently
they
were
not
ready
from
that
moment
the
difficulties
that
would
have
attended
such
a
movement
increased
hourly
a
force
of
men
was
raised
almost
immediately
for
the
defense
of
belgrade
to
meet
this
opposition
the
austrians
had
on
the
evening
of
the
day
war
was
declared
july
only
one
division
concentrated
between
semlin
and
pancsova
opposite
belgrade
a
force
that
was
hardly
sufficient
to
take
the
serbian
capital
two
days
later
an
army
corps
would
have
been
needed
for
the
enterprise
for
by
this
time
the
serbian
army
had
begun
concentrating
considerable
numbers
within
striking
distance
of
the
capital
thus
the
first
opportunity
was
lost
by
the
tardiness
of
the
austrians
to
act
it
is
presumed
that
the
reader
has
already
studied
the
description
of
this
theatre
of
the
war
presented
elsewhere
in
this
work
aside
from
that
the
movements
that
follow
should
only
be
traced
with
the
aid
of
a
map
written
words
are
inadequate
to
give
a
concrete
picture
of
the
field
of
operations
the
austrian
general
staff
realized
the
difficulties
of
crossing
the
danube
its
general
plan
probably
prepared
long
before
contemplated
a
main
attack
that
should
begin
from
another
quarter
the
frontier
almost
miles
in
extent
is
formed
on
the
north
by
the
save
as
well
as
by
the
danube
and
on
the
east
and
southeast
by
the
drina
river
these
two
smaller
streams
abound
in
convenient
fords
especially
in
summer
to
many
of
these
points
on
the
northeastern
frontier
austria
had
already
constructed
strategic
railways
moreover
the
austrian
territory
throughout
this
section
is
so
mountainous
and
well
timbered
that
large
forces
of
troops
could
be
well
screened
from
observation
whereas
the
country
opposite
belgrade
is
fiat
and
bane
it
was
from
this
direction
that
the
serbian
general
staff
expected
the
first
advance
of
the
enemy
and
yet
there
were
dozens
of
other
points
where
an
attack
in
force
was
possible
each
must
be
covered
with
a
force
at
least
strong
enough
to
hold
the
enemy
back
long
enough
to
enable
the
forces
stationed
at
the
other
points
to
come
up
to
support
here
was
the
great
advantage
that
the
austrians
had
to
begin
with
an
advantage
which
the
attacking
army
always
enjoys
the
attacking
general
alone
knows
where
the
first
battle
shall
be
fought
the
serbians
therefore
could
not
count
on
meeting
the
austrians
in
full
force
before
they
could
enter
serbian
territory
they
realized
that
they
must
give
way
at
the
first
contact
that
the
austrians
would
undoubtedly
advance
quite
some
distance
within
serbian
territory
before
enough
serbian
forces
could
be
brought
up
against
them
to
make
the
opposition
effective
realizing
this
it
was
decided
to
place
fairly
strong
advance
guards
at
all
probable
points
of
invasion
with
orders
to
resist
as
long
as
possible
until
in
fact
defensive
tactics
could
be
adapted
to
the
situation
and
the
main
serbian
army
could
be
brought
up
to
offer
battle
however
two
points
stood
out
as
the
most
probable
these
were
the
two
already
mentioned
the
north
along
the
line
from
obrenovatz
to
belgrade
and
to
semendria
or
the
front
the
first
possibility
had
the
advantage
to
the
austrians
of
offering
the
shortest
route
to
the
center
of
the
country
the
morava
valley
their
natural
objective
but
it
also
necessitated
a
difficult
crossing
of
the
danube
which
would
have
had
to
be
preceded
by
the
building
of
pontoon
bridges
this
would
have
given
the
serbians
time
to
move
up
their
main
forces
the
second
alternative
an
invasion
from
the
east
would
have
entailed
a
longer
journey
but
the
advantage
of
natural
covering
and
easy
crossing
made
it
a
sounder
plan
on
july
the
serbians
concentrated
their
forces
in
anticipation
of
either
event
the
outpost
forces
were
stationed
at
or
near
losnitza
shabatz
obrenovatz
belgrade
semendria
pozarevatz
and
gradishte
but
their
principal
armies
were
centrally
grouped
along
the
line
while
weaker
though
important
detachments
were
stationed
in
the
vicinity
of
valievo
a
branch
railroad
terminus
and
uzitze
this
narrowed
the
field
down
to
such
limits
that
it
was
possible
to
march
the
troops
from
point
to
point
while
the
few
railway
facilities
available
were
utilized
for
food
and
ammunition
supplies
chapter
xlviii
austrian
successes
on
the
morning
of
july
the
day
after
war
had
been
declared
the
residents
of
belgrade
were
startled
by
a
deep
roar
followed
by
the
whistling
shriek
of
a
huge
body
hurtling
through
the
air
and
a
shell
burst
over
the
battlements
of
the
old
turkish
citadel
doing
no
damage
immediately
there
came
another
deep
shock
the
serbian
guns
were
responding
thence
on
the
cannonading
along
the
danube
front
continued
for
week
after
week
with
only
now
and
then
a
lull
the
austrian
batteries
bombarded
not
only
belgrade
but
semendria
gradishte
and
a
number
of
other
points
along
the
river
bank
next
they
were
seen
building
a
pontoon
bridge
out
to
one
of
the
little
islands
in
the
river
opposite
the
city
and
barges
were
towed
alongside
the
landings
on
the
opposite
shore
presently
to
be
crowded
with
black
masses
of
austrian
troops
naturally
the
serbian
gunners
made
these
objects
the
targets
of
their
fire
but
these
were
mere
bluffs
such
feints
as
the
skilled
boxer
makes
when
he
wants
to
get
behind
the
guard
of
his
opponent
if
anything
these
demonstrations
only
served
to
deepen
the
conviction
of
general
putnik
that
the
real
danger
was
not
from
this
quarter
but
where
was
the
first
great
blow
to
strike
naturally
not
only
the
general
staff
but
the
whole
army
and
population
waited
in
deep
anxiety
this
tension
lasted
over
the
last
days
of
july
into
the
first
week
of
august
then
on
august
some
bosnian
peasants
serbs
appeared
and
reported
that
they
had
seen
great
bodies
of
soldiers
moving
along
the
mountain
roads
toward
syrmia
in
northeastern
bosnia
two
days
later
early
in
the
morning
two
austrian
aeroplanes
whirred
over
the
river
save
and
circled
over
krupani
shaoatz
and
valievo
the
last
doubts
were
then
dispelled
the
attack
was
coming
from
the
east
and
finally
on
august
the
message
flashed
over
the
wires
that
the
outposts
had
seen
boats
in
movement
full
of
soldiers
behind
an
island
on
the
drina
opposite
loznitza
near
that
town
and
in
fact
along
the
whole
lower
course
of
the
drina
the
river
has
frequently
changed
its
channel
thus
cutting
out
numerous
small
islands
which
would
serve
as
a
screen
to
the
movements
of
troops
contemplating
a
crossing
pontoon
bridges
could
be
built
on
the
farther
side
of
almost
any
of
these
islands
without
being
observed
from
the
other
shore
this
was
exactly
what
the
austrians
were
doing
suddenly
on
august
there
came
a
burst
of
rifle
fire
and
the
boom
of
heavy
field
guns
and
a
fleet
of
barges
under
cover
of
this
fire
emerged
from
around
both
ends
of
one
of
these
islands
and
made
for
the
serbian
shore
the
two
battalions
of
third
reserve
serbians
stationed
there
as
an
outpost
trained
their
old
de
bange
field
guns
of
which
they
had
two
batteries
on
the
oncoming
swarms
and
began
firing
but
the
austrian
fire
became
heavier
and
heavier
a
blast
of
steel
pellets
and
shells
swept
through
the
cornfields
and
the
plum
orchards
tearing
through
the
streets
of
the
village
and
crumpling
up
the
houses
the
breastworks
of
the
small
serbian
detachment
were
literally
the
center
of
a
continuous
explosion
of
shells
when
a
full
tenth
of
their
number
lay
dead
or
disabled
the
serbians
began
retiring
across
the
cornfields
and
up
the
slopes
leading
to
the
heights
behind
losnitza
there
on
higher
ground
which
offered
more
effective
shelter
they
made
a
determined
stand
and
continued
their
fire
on
the
austrian
masses
having
crossed
the
river
the
austrians
threw
up
defensive
breastworks
and
dug
elaborate
trenches
thus
fortifying
their
crossing
next
they
built
a
pontoon
bridge
and
then
the
main
austrian
army
poured
across
a
whole
army
corps
and
two
divisions
of
a
second
meanwhile
on
the
same
day
august
a
similar
event
was
happening
at
shabatz
on
the
save
where
that
river
takes
a
sharp
southward
turn
and
then
swings
up
again
before
joining
the
danube
at
belgrade
here
the
country
is
a
level
plain
really
the
southern
limit
of
the
great
plain
which
stretches
up
to
the
danube
past
belgrade
and
so
into
hungary
here
too
the
austrians
screened
themselves
behind
an
island
in
the
river
then
hurled
their
forces
across
driving
the
feeble
detachment
of
third
reserve
serbian
troops
back
across
the
plain
up
into
the
hills
lying
to
the
southeast
of
shabatz
then
the
advance
guard
of
the
austrian
fourth
army
occupied
the
town
strongly
fortified
it
and
built
a
pontoon
bridge
across
the
river
from
their
railroad
terminus
at
klenak
further
passages
of
a
similar
nature
were
forced
that
day
august
at
other
points
by
smaller
forces
one
at
zvornik
and
another
at
liubovia
in
addition
the
austrians
also
threw
bridges
across
the
river
at
amajlia
and
branjevo
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
invasion
covered
a
front
of
considerably
over
a
hundred
miles
and
that
six
strong
columns
of
the
enemy
had
crossed
all
of
which
naturally
converged
on
valievo
for
valievo
was
the
terminus
of
a
small
single
track
railroad
which
joined
the
main
line
at
mladenovatz
thus
the
austrians
would
have
a
convenient
side
door
open
into
the
heart
of
serbia
which
was
of
course
their
main
objective
to
this
belgrade
was
merely
incidental
with
this
line
of
transport
and
communication
in
austrian
hands
belgrade
would
fall
of
itself
from
losnitza
where
the
main
column
of
austrians
crossed
the
drina
to
valievo
runs
the
river
jadar
along
a
level
valley
which
narrows
as
it
nears
valievo
on
the
side
of
the
jadar
valley
rise
the
southern
slopes
of
the
tzer
mountains
covered
with
cornfields
prune
orchards
with
here
and
there
a
stretch
of
thick
timber
continuing
southward
slightly
to
the
eastward
up
the
jadar
valley
another
range
rises
slightly
smaller
than
the
tzer
mountains
forming
a
smaller
valley
which
branches
off
eastward
along
this
runs
the
river
leshnitza
parallel
with
the
jadar
until
it
makes
an
independent
junction
with
the
drina
still
farther
up
the
valley
the
foothills
of
the
iverak
ridges
are
lost
in
a
series
of
fairly
important
summits
which
closely
flank
the
jadar
river
to
the
south
of
the
jadar
river
the
valley
stretches
into
a
rolling
plain
which
rises
abruptly
into
the
giant
guchevo
mountains
it
is
this
range
converging
with
the
tzer
and
iverak
mountains
toward
valievo
and
forming
the
plain
of
the
jadar
valley
which
was
presently
to
become
the
center
of
the
first
great
battle
between
the
serbians
and
austrians
a
military
movement
against
valievo
therefore
demanded
complete
possession
of
these
two
ridges
which
overlooked
the
line
of
march
this
the
austrians
knew
well
enough
even
before
the
first
of
their
troops
had
crossed
the
drina
as
is
well
known
the
best
maps
not
only
of
serbia
but
of
all
the
balkan
countries
have
been
made
by
austrian
engineers
there
was
probably
not
a
spur
not
a
fissure
certainly
not
a
trail
of
these
mountains
that
had
not
been
carefully
surveyed
and
measured
by
engineers
of
the
austrian
staff
the
austrians
knew
the
country
they
were
invading
quite
as
well
as
did
the
native
serbians
all
through
it
may
be
said
that
it
was
not
through
want
of
accurate
knowledge
that
the
austrians
finally
met
disaster
rather
was
it
because
they
misjudged
the
relative
values
of
their
facts
and
one
of
their
first
mistakes
was
in
overestimating
the
effects
of
the
two
balkan
wars
on
the
efficiency
of
the
serbian
army
first
of
all
as
was
obvious
from
the
leisureliness
with
which
they
proceeded
to
occupy
the
two
mountain
chains
in
question
that
they
vastly
misjudged
the
capacity
of
the
serbian
troops
to
make
rapid
movements
even
as
the
first
shots
were
being
fired
across
the
drina
at
losnitza
the
serbian
forces
were
on
the
move
westward
two
army
corps
were
at
once
rushed
toward
the
valley
of
the
jadar
part
of
a
third
was
sent
to
block
the
advance
of
the
austrians
from
shabatz
meanwhile
the
austrians
took
their
time
for
two
days
they
busied
themselves
fortifying
the
bridge
at
losnitza
chapter
xlix
the
great
battles
begin
on
august
began
the
first
battle
of
the
serbian
campaign
the
austrians
proceeded
to
storm
the
heights
from
which
the
small
outpost
detachments
had
all
the
time
been
bombarding
them
with
its
guns
the
serbians
though
few
in
number
made
a
desperate
resistance
it
was
their
business
to
hold
back
the
enemy
as
long
as
possible
even
until
the
reenforcements
should
arrive
early
in
the
morning
of
august
the
austrians
advanced
in
a
great
mass
then
charged
up
the
hillsides
toward
the
serbian
position
the
serbians
waited
until
they
were
well
up
the
steep
slopes
and
the
rush
of
the
enemy
had
subsided
to
a
more
toilsome
climb
then
they
sent
down
volley
after
volley
from
every
available
weapon
the
austrian
soldiers
who
had
until
then
never
experienced
anything
more
warlike
than
field
maneuvers
lost
their
nerves
the
first
line
broke
and
ran
at
the
first
fire
however
that
was
likely
to
happen
to
any
troops
under
fire
for
the
first
time
down
in
the
plain
they
formed
again
and
again
they
swept
up
the
slopes
this
time
they
did
not
turn
at
the
first
volley
on
they
came
with
fixed
bayonets
and
presently
the
first
line
reached
the
top
of
the
heights
and
the
fighting
was
for
a
moment
the
serbians
overwhelmed
by
numbers
were
on
the
point
of
fleeing
but
these
same
men
had
been
through
many
a
encounter
with
both
turks
and
bulgars
that
experience
stood
them
in
good
stead
and
again
they
swept
back
the
attacking
masses
of
by
evening
august
the
austrians
had
not
yet
taken
the
heights
but
the
serbians
most
of
them
and
old
men
had
spent
their
vitality
as
the
dark
night
lowered
over
the
scene
they
fell
back
until
at
jarebitze
they
met
the
first
advance
guards
of
the
oncoming
serbian
main
army
and
here
they
halted
and
the
united
forces
proceeded
to
dig
a
trench
on
a
front
extending
from
north
to
south
through
the
town
and
clear
across
the
jadar
valley
nor
did
the
austrians
then
attempt
to
follow
up
this
first
success
thus
the
serbians
were
allowed
to
intrench
themselves
unmolested
until
next
day
august
they
were
joined
by
the
balance
of
their
forces
now
by
studying
the
map
it
will
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
it
was
only
the
tzer
mountains
which
separated
the
austrian
column
crossing
the
drina
at
losnitza
and
the
column
which
had
crossed
the
save
and
had
occupied
shabatz
should
the
austrians
from
over
the
drina
get
possession
of
the
tzer
ridges
they
would
thus
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
in
shabatz
and
so
form
a
line
that
would
cut
off
a
large
portion
of
northwestern
serbia
aside
from
that
they
would
have
a
solid
front
but
should
the
serbians
possess
themselves
of
the
tzer
ridges
first
then
they
would
have
driven
a
wedge
in
between
their
two
main
forces
this
would
make
it
difficult
for
either
to
advance
for
then
they
would
be
exposing
a
flank
to
the
enemy
who
would
also
have
a
great
advantage
in
position
moreover
the
serbians
would
be
in
a
position
to
turn
immediately
toward
either
of
the
austrians
columns
whichever
might
need
most
attention
meanwhile
the
serbian
cavalry
had
made
a
reconnaissance
toward
shabatz
they
immediately
sent
back
reports
of
overwhelming
forces
occupying
the
town
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
make
any
attack
there
for
the
present
it
was
now
learned
for
the
first
time
that
another
of
the
columns
had
crossed
the
drina
far
down
in
the
south
and
was
marching
on
krupanie
just
below
the
guchevo
mountains
and
on
the
way
to
the
upper
part
of
the
jadar
valley
however
as
the
first
report
seemed
to
indicate
that
this
was
only
a
minor
force
a
small
force
of
third
reserve
men
was
detached
to
hold
this
force
back
and
prevent
its
entrance
into
the
main
field
of
operations
during
the
day
and
night
of
august
the
two
opposing
forces
were
moving
into
position
for
battle
setting
the
pawns
for
the
game
of
strategy
that
was
to
be
played
the
austrians
at
losnitza
were
advancing
up
the
mountain
slopes
and
took
possession
of
the
tzer
and
iverak
ridges
straddling
the
leshnitza
valley
up
in
shabatz
austrian
troops
were
pouring
across
the
pontoon
bridges
a
flanking
column
coming
from
the
drina
had
arrived
at
slepehevitch
another
force
was
stationed
with
its
left
and
center
on
krupani
its
right
spread
out
into
the
mountains
north
of
liubovia
on
the
serbian
side
the
right
wing
of
the
second
army
screened
by
the
cavalry
division
were
preparing
to
cut
off
the
austrian
forces
in
the
north
from
their
juncture
with
those
advancing
along
the
tzer
ridges
the
center
and
left
was
marching
on
the
enemy
on
the
iverak
ridges
in
conjunction
with
the
right
of
the
third
army
then
north
of
jarebitze
the
center
of
the
third
held
the
positions
south
of
jarebitze
while
its
left
split
into
small
detachments
had
been
directed
to
oppose
the
invasion
toward
krupanie
and
the
advance
from
liubovia
such
were
the
positions
of
the
various
forces
as
dawn
broke
brightly
on
the
morning
of
august
as
the
growing
light
made
objects
visible
the
extreme
right
division
of
the
serbian
front
which
was
creeping
northward
to
cut
off
shabatz
discovered
a
strong
austrian
column
moving
along
the
lower
spurs
of
the
tzer
mountains
obviously
this
body
was
clearing
the
ground
for
a
general
descent
of
the
forces
up
along
the
ridges
a
whole
army
corps
this
movement
threatened
to
become
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
serbian
plan
of
separating
the
austrians
in
shabatz
from
those
farther
south
but
the
situation
was
saved
by
one
of
those
incidents
which
sometimes
stand
out
above
the
savagery
of
warfare
and
give
to
it
a
touch
of
grandeur
a
young
artillery
officer
major
djukitch
of
the
fourth
artillery
regiment
asked
permission
to
go
out
and
meet
this
body
of
advancing
austrians
with
but
a
single
cannon
he
would
create
a
diversion
which
would
give
the
serbians
time
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
changed
conditions
though
the
chances
were
very
largely
in
favor
of
his
losing
his
life
on
this
mission
permission
was
granted
calling
on
volunteers
from
his
command
he
advanced
with
his
single
cannon
and
took
up
a
position
in
the
path
of
the
approaching
enemy
the
moment
he
opened
fire
the
austrians
naturally
not
realizing
that
only
one
cannon
was
opposing
them
and
believing
that
a
large
serbian
force
had
surprised
them
broke
into
a
panic
half
an
hour
after
he
had
opened
fire
the
serbian
field
commander
sent
a
messenger
to
major
djukitch
ordering
him
to
retire
in
reply
he
sent
a
message
to
the
commander
describing
the
confusion
he
had
created
in
the
austrian
ranks
and
instead
of
retiring
he
asked
for
reenforcements
the
balance
of
his
own
battery
a
detachment
of
infantry
and
a
cavalry
division
was
sent
him
the
result
was
that
the
austrian
column
was
temporarily
driven
back
into
the
mountains
hastily
the
austrians
now
massed
along
a
line
extending
from
belikamen
to
radlovatz
while
the
serbians
deployed
along
a
front
running
from
slatina
through
metkovitch
to
gusingrob
at
august
the
two
opposing
forces
opened
fire
in
earnest
up
and
down
the
line
all
day
the
cannon
roared
and
the
rifles
and
machine
guns
crackled
now
and
again
the
austrians
would
shoot
forth
from
their
line
a
sharp
infantry
attack
but
these
were
repulsed
with
more
and
more
difficulty
as
the
day
advanced
for
the
serbians
were
much
inferior
in
numbers
toward
evening
their
situation
became
very
critical
yet
every
part
of
the
line
held
out
desperately
knowing
that
reenforcements
were
being
hurried
forward
from
the
rear
as
fast
as
men
could
move
and
just
before
dark
along
the
roads
from
the
eastward
came
the
distant
cheers
from
the
advancing
columns
an
officer
dashed
up
on
horseback
shouting
encouragement
to
the
battered
men
in
the
trenches
a
cheer
arose
which
rolled
up
and
down
the
line
again
it
rose
then
even
before
it
had
died
out
with
wild
yells
the
serbians
sprang
over
their
breastworks
and
swept
madly
across
the
intervening
space
to
the
austrian
lines
smashing
through
cornfields
over
rocks
through
the
tall
grass
of
orchards
at
their
heels
followed
the
reenforcing
soldiers
though
they
had
that
day
marched
nearly
sixty
miles
over
the
austrian
breastworks
they
surged
like
an
angry
wave
from
the
sea
their
bayonets
gleaming
in
the
sunset
glow
it
was
the
kind
of
fighting
they
knew
best
the
kind
that
both
serbians
and
bulgars
know
best
the
kind
they
had
practiced
most
small
wonder
if
the
inexperienced
peasants
from
the
plains
of
hungary
unused
till
then
to
any
sight
more
bloody
than
a
brawl
in
the
village
inn
trembled
before
this
onslaught
their
officers
shouted
encouragement
and
oaths
barely
audible
above
the
mad
yells
of
the
serbians
nevertheless
they
gave
way
before
the
gleaming
line
of
bayonet
blades
before
them
some
few
rose
to
fight
stirred
by
some
instinct
generated
in
the
days
of
genghis
khan
but
the
majority
turned
and
fled
down
the
sides
of
the
mountains
toward
the
valleys
leaving
behind
guns
ammunition
and
cannon
one
regiment
the
hundred
and
second
stood
its
ground
and
fought
as
a
result
it
was
almost
completely
annihilated
the
same
fate
befell
the
regiment
but
the
majority
sought
and
found
safety
in
flight
by
dark
the
whole
austrian
center
was
beaten
back
leaving
behind
great
quantities
of
war
material
chapter
l
first
victory
of
the
serbians
the
serbians
had
made
their
first
move
successfully
on
that
day
of
august
more
important
than
this
mere
preliminary
defeat
of
the
enemy
was
the
fact
that
the
austrians
in
shabatz
were
now
definitely
cut
off
from
any
possible
juncture
with
the
austrians
in
the
south
for
the
present
they
were
debarred
from
entering
the
main
field
of
operations
this
freed
the
serbian
cavalry
for
action
elsewhere
meanwhile
a
portion
of
the
right
wing
of
the
serbian
line
was
detached
to
keep
the
austrians
inside
shabatz
farther
to
the
south
the
serbians
were
not
so
decidedly
successful
the
center
of
the
serbian
second
army
that
directed
against
the
southern
slopes
of
the
tzer
mountains
and
the
iverak
ridges
had
arrived
at
tekerish
at
midnight
as
dawn
broke
on
august
they
perceived
a
strong
austrian
column
descending
from
above
coming
in
the
same
direction
unfortunately
the
serbians
were
in
the
midst
of
bald
rolling
foothills
while
the
austrians
were
up
among
the
tall
timber
which
clothes
the
mountain
slopes
at
this
point
the
serbians
deployed
extending
their
line
from
bornololye
through
parlok
to
lisena
centering
their
artillery
at
kik
the
austrians
made
the
best
of
their
superior
position
for
some
hours
there
was
furious
firing
then
at
about
eight
the
austrian
gunners
got
the
range
of
the
serbian
left
flank
with
their
field
pieces
which
was
compelled
to
fall
back
but
just
then
timely
reenforcements
arrived
from
the
rear
and
the
serbians
dug
themselves
in
by
evening
the
serbians
had
lost
over
a
thousand
men
though
they
had
succeeded
in
taking
prisoners
and
several
machine
guns
from
the
austrians
the
left
wing
of
the
second
army
had
in
the
meantime
arrived
against
iverak
that
this
division
was
able
to
arrive
at
such
a
timely
juncture
was
due
to
its
having
made
a
forced
march
of
miles
over
the
mountain
roads
during
the
previous
day
yet
before
dawn
on
the
morning
of
august
it
was
ready
to
continue
its
march
to
poporparlok
but
then
came
the
news
that
the
austrians
had
driven
back
the
left
wing
of
the
third
army
from
that
position
and
had
occupied
it
the
situation
in
which
this
division
found
itself
was
by
no
means
clear
nothing
had
been
heard
from
shabatz
the
division
operating
along
the
tzer
ridges
had
been
badly
hammered
the
third
army
had
lost
poporparlok
the
commander
decided
to
stay
where
he
was
and
simply
hold
the
ground
against
any
advance
of
the
enemy
from
iverak
this
division
was
therefore
intrenched
along
a
line
from
begluk
to
kik
and
a
strong
advance
was
thrown
out
toward
kugovitchi
during
the
morning
this
advance
guard
made
a
strong
attack
against
kugovitchi
drove
the
austrians
out
and
established
themselves
there
at
dawn
august
the
left
flank
of
this
division
at
begluk
was
shelled
by
the
austrian
artillery
which
was
followed
by
infantry
attacks
these
were
easily
repulsed
during
the
day
but
then
the
enemy
was
reenforced
and
late
that
night
they
came
on
again
in
great
masses
the
serbians
allowed
them
to
almost
reach
their
trenches
then
emptying
the
magazines
of
their
rifles
at
them
they
piled
themselves
over
their
breastworks
and
into
them
with
bayonets
and
hand
bombs
this
was
too
much
for
the
austrians
they
fled
in
wild
disorder
least
encouraging
was
the
experience
of
the
serbian
third
army
which
was
defending
the
territory
south
of
the
iverak
mountains
here
the
austrians
developed
a
vigorous
and
persistent
offensive
hoping
to
turn
the
serbian
left
and
thus
capture
the
road
to
valievo
the
attack
on
the
positions
at
jarebitze
commenced
at
daybreak
on
august
here
the
serbians
held
good
ground
rocky
summits
but
so
limited
in
extent
that
there
was
room
only
for
a
few
companies
at
a
time
on
the
other
hand
the
ground
before
them
was
broken
up
into
hollows
screened
by
growing
corn
this
enabled
the
austrians
to
deploy
their
lines
beyond
the
serbian
flanks
unseen
they
did
execute
just
such
a
movement
and
attempted
to
circle
around
toward
the
serbian
rear
at
the
same
time
the
serbians
here
were
attacked
from
in
front
by
another
hostile
column
which
had
come
from
across
the
plain
on
the
south
side
of
the
jadar
valley
where
hollows
sunken
roads
and
fields
of
corn
again
formed
ample
screening
however
in
spite
of
all
these
movements
the
serbians
were
able
to
hold
their
own
the
austrian
attacks
were
all
beaten
back
their
position
might
have
been
held
indefinitely
but
developments
to
the
south
were
taking
on
a
threatening
form
it
will
be
remembered
that
an
austrian
force
had
been
reported
approaching
from
the
south
moving
on
krupanie
and
that
it
had
seemed
so
insignificant
that
a
small
detachment
of
third
reserve
troops
had
been
sent
to
hold
it
back
but
this
enemy
force
now
developed
into
three
mountain
brigades
reenforcements
of
infantry
and
mountain
artillery
were
hurried
down
to
support
the
retaining
force
but
the
austrians
were
able
to
force
their
way
on
toward
zavlaka
seeing
valievo
thus
threatened
the
serbians
retired
from
their
position
at
jarebitze
and
took
up
a
new
position
along
a
line
from
marianovitche
to
schumer
thus
enabling
them
to
face
both
the
enemy
columns
this
retreat
was
fortunately
not
interfered
with
by
the
austrians
though
in
executing
it
the
serbian
artillery
which
had
been
in
position
on
the
right
bank
of
the
jadar
was
obliged
to
pass
along
the
austrian
front
in
single
file
in
order
to
gain
the
main
road
early
the
next
morning
august
the
serbians
were
in
position
and
had
extended
their
line
to
soldatovitcha
whence
the
detachment
from
krupanie
had
retired
summing
up
the
day
fighting
and
considering
it
as
a
whole
it
will
be
seen
that
the
austrians
had
pretty
well
held
their
own
except
on
their
extreme
left
where
they
had
failed
to
get
in
touch
with
their
forces
in
shabatz
after
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
at
belikamen
on
august
the
cavalry
division
was
reenforced
by
some
infantry
and
artillery
then
sent
on
the
delicate
mission
of
driving
a
wedge
in
between
the
austrians
in
shabatz
and
those
along
the
drina
spreading
out
across
the
matchva
plain
its
left
wing
up
against
the
slopes
of
the
tzer
mountains
and
its
right
wing
within
reach
of
shabatz
it
advanced
as
far
as
dublje
in
the
north
at
the
same
time
it
was
able
to
assist
the
column
advancing
along
the
tzer
ridges
by
playing
its
artillery
on
the
austrian
position
in
the
mountains
at
troyan
throughout
all
the
fighting
this
cavalry
division
rendered
notable
service
by
its
dismounted
action
on
the
morning
of
august
the
extreme
right
of
the
serbian
front
now
turned
toward
shabatz
though
only
half
the
number
of
the
forces
they
were
proceeding
to
engage
they
continued
onward
but
on
closer
approach
it
became
apparent
that
they
could
do
nothing
more
than
hold
the
austrians
inside
the
town
so
well
and
so
thoroughly
had
the
austrians
fortified
themselves
that
it
was
hopeless
for
so
small
a
force
to
attempt
an
attack
thus
this
section
of
the
serbian
front
settled
down
to
wait
for
reenforcements
the
center
and
left
of
the
second
army
now
prepared
to
advance
along
the
tzer
and
iverak
ridges
the
austrians
in
this
section
who
had
suffered
so
severely
the
day
before
at
belikamen
were
now
concentrated
around
troyan
the
most
easterly
and
the
second
highest
peak
of
the
chain
at
dawn
on
august
the
serbians
located
the
austrians
immediately
they
began
a
heavy
artillery
fire
on
this
position
then
proceeded
to
infantry
attack
two
regiments
hurled
themselves
up
the
slopes
and
with
bayonets
and
hand
bombs
drove
the
austrians
back
after
that
no
further
progress
was
possible
that
day
the
serbians
having
to
wait
for
their
artillery
to
come
up
the
austrians
now
began
intrenching
themselves
on
the
heights
of
kosaningrad
the
loftiest
portion
of
the
tzer
range
along
the
iverak
ridges
the
austrians
made
a
determined
advance
the
situation
of
the
serbian
troops
in
this
section
the
left
wing
of
the
second
army
was
extremely
dangerous
for
their
left
flank
was
becoming
exposed
by
the
continued
retreat
of
the
third
army
the
only
hopeful
aspect
of
their
situation
was
that
the
austrians
were
also
having
their
left
flank
exposed
by
the
retreat
of
the
austrians
along
the
tzer
ridges
evidently
the
opposing
forces
realized
this
fact
for
they
made
a
fierce
attempt
to
drive
back
the
serbians
opposing
them
so
that
their
danger
from
the
north
might
be
lessened
half
an
hour
later
they
were
severely
repulsed
but
heavy
reenforcements
came
up
to
the
austrians
just
then
and
again
they
attacked
this
time
more
successfully
by
noon
august
the
austrians
had
extended
their
line
over
to
the
serbian
right
wing
unfortunately
at
about
that
time
the
third
army
again
called
for
assistance
and
this
division
was
compelled
to
send
it
the
result
was
that
it
was
compelled
to
withdraw
gradually
to
the
heights
of
kalem
the
retirement
was
executed
in
good
order
and
the
austrians
satisfied
themselves
with
occupying
kugovitchi
intrenching
themselves
in
their
new
position
the
serbians
awaited
further
attacks
only
an
ineffectual
artillery
fire
was
maintained
by
the
enemy
meanwhile
came
the
good
news
of
the
success
of
the
serbians
along
the
tzer
ridges
so
preparations
were
made
for
another
advance
on
the
following
day
august
as
has
already
been
stated
the
extreme
south
wing
of
the
serbian
front
the
third
army
had
retreated
the
day
before
so
that
it
could
present
a
solid
front
against
not
only
the
forces
opposing
it
but
also
another
column
coming
up
from
the
south
whose
advance
had
been
inadequately
covered
by
third
reserve
men
here
the
austrians
attempted
to
pierce
the
serbian
line
in
the
extreme
south
and
come
out
at
oseshina
but
though
vastly
outnumbered
the
serbians
held
their
ground
stoutly
until
late
afternoon
when
as
already
shown
they
were
compelled
to
ask
the
division
operating
along
iverak
for
assistance
when
this
help
came
they
were
able
to
resume
their
defense
thus
ended
the
second
day
of
the
general
battle
on
the
whole
the
austrians
had
suffered
most
but
the
general
situation
was
still
somewhat
in
their
favor
the
austrian
center
along
the
tzer
ridges
had
been
pushed
back
to
retrieve
this
setback
the
logical
course
for
the
austrian
commander
in
chief
was
to
curl
his
wings
in
around
the
serbian
flanks
that
he
appreciated
this
necessity
was
obvious
to
judge
from
the
furious
onslaughts
against
the
serbian
third
army
in
the
extreme
south
but
to
weaken
the
serbian
center
by
these
tactics
it
was
also
necessary
to
free
the
austrians
in
shabatz
or
at
least
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
assume
a
strong
offensive
against
the
extreme
right
of
the
serbians
and
if
possible
flank
them
but
the
serbians
anticipated
the
plans
of
the
austrians
additional
reenforcements
were
sent
to
the
extreme
right
with
orders
to
spare
no
sacrifice
that
would
keep
the
austrians
inclosed
within
their
fortifications
around
shabatz
and
true
enough
next
morning
august
shortly
after
the
hot
summer
sun
had
risen
over
the
eastern
ridges
the
austrians
emerged
from
shabatz
and
attacked
the
serbians
the
austrian
onslaught
was
furious
so
furious
that
step
by
step
the
serbians
in
spite
of
their
reenforcements
were
driven
back
fortunately
toward
evening
the
austrian
offensive
began
losing
its
strength
and
that
night
the
serbians
were
able
to
intrench
along
a
line
from
leskovitz
to
mihana
this
obliged
the
cavalry
division
which
had
been
cooperating
with
the
serbian
center
and
was
driving
the
austrians
toward
leshnitza
to
retire
along
a
line
from
metkovitch
to
brestovatz
naturally
the
advance
of
the
austrians
from
shabatz
was
endangering
its
right
flank
moreover
a
reenforced
column
of
austrians
also
appeared
before
it
but
this
opposing
force
did
not
press
its
advance
meanwhile
on
the
same
day
august
the
austrians
were
reenforcing
their
position
on
the
tzer
ridges
they
had
also
strongly
fortified
the
height
of
rashulatcha
which
lay
between
the
heights
of
tzer
and
iverak
whence
they
could
direct
an
artillery
fire
to
either
field
of
activities
but
the
difficulties
which
the
serbians
operating
along
the
iverak
ridges
were
meeting
also
hampered
the
serbians
who
were
attempting
to
sweep
the
austrians
back
along
the
tzer
ridges
if
they
advanced
too
far
they
would
expose
their
flank
to
the
austrians
over
on
iverak
as
a
general
rule
it
is
always
dangerous
for
any
body
of
troops
to
advance
any
distance
beyond
the
general
line
of
the
whole
front
and
this
case
was
no
exception
however
though
delayed
this
division
did
advance
oxen
were
employed
in
dragging
the
heavy
field
pieces
along
the
trails
over
the
rocky
ridges
with
savage
yells
the
serbian
soldiers
leaped
over
the
rocks
up
the
jagged
slopes
of
kosaningrad
again
they
had
fallen
back
on
their
favorite
weapons
bayonets
and
hand
bombs
the
austrians
put
up
a
stout
resistance
but
finally
their
gray
lines
broke
then
scattered
down
the
slopes
followed
by
the
pursuing
serbians
having
gained
possession
of
kosaningrad
peak
the
serbian
commander
next
turned
his
attention
to
rashulatcha
which
in
conjunction
with
the
serbians
over
on
iverak
could
now
be
raked
by
a
cross
artillery
fire
he
had
previously
left
a
reserve
force
behind
at
troyan
this
he
now
ordered
to
reenforce
his
left
which
had
been
advancing
along
the
southern
slopes
of
the
tzer
range
this
force
he
now
directed
against
the
heights
but
the
movement
was
not
vigorously
followed
up
over
on
iverak
the
serbians
had
succeeded
in
making
some
headway
forming
into
two
columns
this
wing
marched
out
and
attacked
the
austrians
at
yugovitchi
and
succeeded
in
driving
them
from
their
trenches
but
immediately
the
austrian
artillery
on
reingrob
opened
fire
on
them
and
they
were
compelled
to
dig
themselves
in
and
late
that
night
august
the
austrians
delivered
a
fierce
counterattack
but
night
fighting
is
especially
a
matter
of
experience
and
here
the
serbians
with
their
two
balkan
campaigns
behind
them
proved
immensely
superior
they
drove
the
austrians
back
with
their
bayonets
during
that
same
day
august
the
austrians
had
renewed
their
pressure
on
the
third
army
and
the
third
ban
men
soldatovitcha
was
their
first
objective
during
the
day
reenforcements
arrived
and
the
commanding
general
was
able
to
hold
his
own
retaking
soldatovitcha
after
it
had
once
been
lost
thus
ended
the
day
of
august
the
third
day
of
the
battle
early
next
morning
on
august
the
austrians
in
shabatz
renewed
their
efforts
to
penetrate
the
serbian
lines
to
the
southward
so
determined
was
their
effort
that
finally
the
serbians
in
this
sector
were
driven
back
over
on
to
the
right
bank
of
the
river
dobrava
all
day
the
fighting
continued
the
serbians
barely
holding
their
position
strong
as
it
was
this
success
of
the
austrians
hampered
the
cavalry
division
which
had
not
only
to
secure
its
flank
but
had
also
to
keep
between
the
shabatz
austrians
and
the
serbians
operating
on
tzer
whom
they
might
have
attacked
from
the
rear
along
the
tzer
ridges
however
things
were
going
well
for
the
serbians
at
noon
they
had
taken
rashulatcha
which
left
the
column
free
to
continue
its
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
austrians
along
the
ridges
from
the
heights
above
the
serbian
guns
fired
into
the
retreating
austrians
down
along
the
leshnitza
river
turning
the
retreat
into
a
mad
panic
by
evening
the
advance
guard
of
this
division
had
arrived
at
jadranska
leshnitza
in
the
early
morning
august
the
serbians
over
on
the
iverak
ridges
had
attacked
in
deadly
earnest
naturally
the
huge
success
and
rapid
advance
of
the
serbians
over
on
the
tzer
ridges
were
of
great
importance
to
them
here
the
austrians
were
put
to
rout
too
at
the
serbians
stormed
velika
glava
and
took
it
but
here
their
progress
was
checked
by
a
strong
artillery
fire
from
the
west
of
rashulatcha
then
rifle
firing
broke
out
along
the
whole
line
from
velika
glava
to
kik
near
kik
the
austrians
were
massing
in
strong
force
and
the
third
army
was
reported
to
be
again
in
danger
this
time
from
a
hostile
turning
movement
fortunately
general
headquarters
was
able
to
come
to
the
rescue
with
reenforcements
this
lessened
the
danger
from
kik
whereupon
the
advance
along
iverak
was
continued
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
the
austrians
were
driven
out
of
reingrob
the
serbians
controlled
the
situation
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
was
complete
the
third
army
was
again
in
trouble
during
this
day
august
its
left
flank
continued
its
advance
from
soldatovitcha
but
the
austrians
attempted
to
pierce
their
center
but
finally
this
sorely
tried
section
of
the
serbian
front
emerged
triumphant
before
evening
the
austrians
were
driven
back
in
scattered
disorder
leaving
behind
them
three
hospitals
filled
with
wounded
much
material
and
prisoners
here
ended
the
fourth
day
of
the
bloody
struggle
august
in
the
north
around
shabatz
the
austrians
had
made
some
advance
but
all
along
the
rest
of
the
line
they
had
suffered
complete
disaster
the
two
important
mountain
ridges
tzer
and
iverak
which
dominated
the
whole
theatre
of
operations
were
definitely
in
the
hands
of
the
serbians
and
finally
the
third
army
had
at
last
broken
down
the
opposition
against
it
next
morning
august
dawned
on
a
situation
that
was
thoroughly
hopeless
for
the
austrians
even
up
around
shabatz
where
they
had
been
successful
the
day
before
the
austrians
realizing
that
all
was
lost
to
the
southward
made
only
a
feeble
attack
on
the
serbians
who
were
consequently
able
to
recross
the
dobrava
river
and
establish
themselves
on
the
right
bank
the
cavalry
division
whose
left
flank
was
not
freed
by
the
clearing
of
the
tzer
ridges
hurled
itself
against
the
austrians
in
the
plains
before
it
and
threw
them
into
wild
disorder
first
they
shelled
them
then
charged
the
magyars
fled
through
the
villages
across
the
corn
fields
through
the
orchards
where
is
the
drina
where
is
the
drina
they
shouted
whenever
they
saw
a
peasant
a
burning
tropical
sun
sweltered
over
the
plain
many
of
the
fleeing
soldiers
dropped
from
exhaustion
and
were
afterward
taken
prisoners
others
lost
themselves
in
the
marshy
hollows
and
only
emerged
days
later
while
still
others
wounded
laid
down
and
died
where
they
fell
in
the
leshnitza
similar
scenes
were
taking
place
from
the
ridges
above
the
serbian
guns
roared
and
poured
hurtling
steel
messages
of
death
down
into
the
throngs
of
retreating
austrians
some
few
regiments
not
so
demoralized
as
the
others
did
indeed
make
several
attempts
to
fight
actions
to
protect
their
fleeing
comrades
but
they
again
were
overwhelmed
by
the
disorganized
masses
in
the
rear
pouring
over
them
in
the
jadar
valley
another
disorganized
mob
of
austrians
was
fleeing
before
the
serbians
up
on
the
iverak
ridges
who
also
were
pouring
a
hot
artillery
fire
into
their
midst
presently
the
third
army
joined
in
the
mad
chase
and
now
the
whole
austrian
army
was
wildly
fleeing
for
the
drina
river
there
remained
only
one
exception
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
august
this
was
the
austrian
forces
on
kik
to
the
northwest
of
zavlaka
the
serbian
reenforcements
which
it
will
be
remembered
had
originally
been
directed
toward
marianovitche
had
been
afterward
sent
westward
and
at
dawn
on
august
they
approached
kik
in
two
columns
the
left
column
occupied
osoye
without
resistance
but
in
descending
from
that
position
the
austrian
artillery
opened
fire
on
it
an
hour
later
the
right
column
came
up
and
opened
an
artillery
fire
and
under
cover
of
this
bombardment
a
serbian
regiment
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
as
was
afterward
learned
the
austrians
at
this
point
had
had
their
machine
guns
destroyed
by
the
serbian
artillery
fire
and
by
this
time
their
own
artillery
had
been
sent
back
in
preparation
for
the
retreat
consequently
they
were
only
able
to
receive
the
serbian
attack
with
rifle
fire
at
the
height
of
this
skirmish
the
extreme
left
of
the
serbians
on
iverak
which
had
remained
to
guard
against
attack
from
this
quarter
moved
over
against
the
austrians
the
was
too
much
for
them
they
turned
and
fled
leaving
behind
over
six
hundred
dead
the
serbians
in
this
affair
losing
only
seven
killed
jarebitze
was
now
occupied
the
rest
of
the
serbians
joined
in
the
general
pursuit
that
night
august
the
austrians
swarmed
across
the
drina
fleeing
for
their
lives
by
the
next
day
the
whole
river
bank
was
cleared
of
them
serbian
soldiers
lined
the
whole
length
of
the
frontier
in
this
section
there
remained
now
only
the
austrians
in
shabatz
to
deal
with
the
whole
serbian
army
was
now
able
to
concentrate
on
this
remaining
force
of
the
enemy
left
in
serbian
territory
early
on
august
the
attack
began
and
the
austrians
here
fought
stoutly
indeed
all
that
day
they
held
the
serbians
off
from
behind
their
intrenchments
on
august
the
serbians
made
a
general
assault
fortunately
they
found
a
weakness
in
the
fortifications
on
the
western
side
of
the
town
to
create
a
diversion
the
austrians
delivered
a
counterattack
along
the
road
toward
varna
by
the
morning
of
august
the
serbians
had
brought
up
a
number
of
heavy
siege
guns
but
when
the
general
bombardment
had
already
commenced
it
was
found
that
the
austrians
had
evacuated
the
town
during
the
night
and
retreated
across
the
river
and
so
the
first
austrian
invasion
of
serbia
came
to
its
disastrous
end
