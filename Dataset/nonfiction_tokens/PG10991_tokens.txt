preface
the
popularity
of
the
dog
as
a
companion
as
a
guardian
of
property
as
an
assistant
in
the
pursuit
of
game
and
as
the
object
of
a
pleasurable
hobby
has
never
been
so
great
as
it
is
at
the
present
time
more
dogs
are
kept
in
this
country
than
ever
there
formerly
were
and
they
are
more
skilfully
bred
more
tenderly
treated
and
cared
for
with
a
more
solicitous
pride
than
was
the
case
a
generation
ago
there
are
fewer
mongrels
in
our
midst
and
the
family
dog
has
become
a
respectable
member
of
society
two
million
dog
licences
were
taken
out
in
the
british
isles
in
the
course
of
in
that
year
too
as
many
as
separate
dog
shows
were
sanctioned
by
the
kennel
club
and
held
in
various
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
at
the
present
time
there
exist
no
fewer
than
specialist
clubs
established
for
the
purpose
of
watching
over
the
interests
of
the
different
breeds
recognising
this
advance
in
our
national
love
of
dogs
and
the
growing
demand
for
information
on
their
distinguishing
characteristics
i
am
persuaded
that
there
is
ample
room
for
a
concise
and
practical
handbook
on
matters
canine
in
preparing
the
present
volume
i
have
drawn
abundantly

me

chapter
i
general
history
of
the
dog
there
is
no
incongruity
in
the
idea
that
in
the
very
earliest
period
of
man
habitation
of
this
world
he
made
a
friend
and
companion
of
some
sort
of
aboriginal
representative
of
our
modern
dog
and
that
in
return
for
its
aid
in
protecting
him
from
wilder
animals
and
in
guarding
his
sheep
and
goats
he
gave
it
a
share
of
his
food
a
corner
in
his
dwelling
and
grew
to
trust
it
and
care
for
it
probably
the
animal
was
originally
little
else
than
an
unusually
gentle
jackal
or
an
ailing
wolf
driven
by
its
companions
from
the
wild
marauding
pack
to
seek
shelter
in
alien
surroundings
one
can
well
conceive
the
possibility
of
the
partnership
beginning
in
the
circumstance
of
some
helpless
whelps
being
brought
home
by
the
early
hunters
to
be
tended
and
reared
by
the
women
and
children
the
savage
of
new
guinea
and
does
not
as
a
rule
take
the
trouble
to
tame
and
train
an
adult
wild
animal
for
his
own
purposes
and
primitive
man
was
surely
equally
indifferent
to
the
questionable
advantage
of
harbouring
a
dangerous
guest
but
a
litter
of
woolly
whelps
introduced
into
the
home
as
playthings
for
the
children
would
grow
to
regard
themselves
and
be
regarded
as
members
of
the
family
and
it
would
soon
be
found
that
the
hunting
instincts
of
the
maturing
animal
were
of
value
to
his
captors
the
savage
master
treading
the
primeval
forests
in
search
of
food
would
not
fail
to
recognise
the
helpfulness
of
a
keener
nose
and
sharper
eyes
even
than
his
own
unsullied
senses
while
the
dog
in
his
turn
would
find
a
better
shelter
in
association
with
man
than
if
he
were
hunting
on
his
own
account
thus
mutual
benefit
would
result
in
some
kind
of
tacit
agreement
of
partnership
and
through
the
generations
the
wild
wolf
or
jackal
would
gradually
become
gentler
more
docile
and
tractable
and
the
dreaded
enemy
of
the
flock
develop
into
the
trusted
guardian
of
the
fold
in
nearly
all
parts
of
the
world
traces
of
an
indigenous
dog
family
are
found
the
only
exceptions
being
the
west
indian
islands
madagascar
the
eastern
islands
of
the
malayan
archipelago
new
zealand
and
the
polynesian
islands
where
there
is
no
sign
that
any
dog
wolf
or
fox
has
existed
as
a
true
aboriginal
animal
in
the
ancient
oriental
lands
and
generally
among
the
early
mongolians
the
dog
remained
savage
and
neglected
for
centuries
prowling
in
packs
gaunt
and
as
it
prowls
through
the
streets
and
under
the
walls
of
every
eastern
city
no
attempt
was
made
to
allure
it
into
human
companionship
or
to
improve
it
into
docility
it
is
not
until
we
come
to
examine
the
records
of
the
higher
civilisations
of
assyria
and
egypt
that
we
discover
any
distinct
varieties
of
canine
form
assyrian
sculptures
depict
two
such
a
greyhound
and
a
mastiff
the
latter
described
in
the
tablets
as
the
dog
that
is
to
say
it
was
used
as
a
and
several
varieties
are
referred
to
in
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
preserved
in
the
british
museum
the
egyptian
monuments
of
about
present
many
forms
of
the
domestic
dog
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
among
the
ancient
egyptians
it
was
as
completely
a
companion
of
man
as
much
a
favourite
in
the
house
and
a
help
in
the
chase
as
it
is
among
ourselves
at
present
in
the
city
of
cynopolis
it
was
reverenced
next
to
the
sacred
jackal
and
on
the
death
of
a
dog
the
members
of
the
household
to
which
he
had
belonged
carefully
shaved
their
whole
bodies
and
religiously
abstained
from
using
the
food
of
whatever
kind
which
happened
to
be
in
the
house
at
the
time
among
the
distinct
breeds
kept
in
egypt
there
was
a
massive
a
large
hound
with
drooping
ears
and
a
pointed
head
at
least
two
varieties
of
greyhound
used
for
hunting
the
gazelle
and
a
small
breed
of
terrier
or
turnspit
with
short
crooked
legs
this
last
appears
to
have
been
regarded
as
an
especial
household
pet
for
it
was
admitted
into
the
living
rooms
and
taken
as
a
companion
for
walks
out
of
doors
it
was
furnished
with
a
collar
of
leaves
or
of
leather
or
precious
metal
wrought
into
the
form
of
leaves
and
when
it
died
it
was
embalmed
every
town
throughout
egypt
had
its
place
of
interment
for
canine
mummies
the
dog
was
not
greatly
appreciated
in
palestine
and
in
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
it
is
commonly
spoken
of
with
scorn
and
contempt
as
an
unclean
beast
even
the
familiar
reference
to
the
sheepdog
in
the
book
of
job
now
they
that
are
younger
than
i
have
me
in
derision
whose
fathers
i
would
have
disdained
to
set
with
the
dogs
of
my
is
not
without
a
suggestion
of
contempt
and
it
is
significant
that
the
only
biblical
allusion
to
the
dog
as
a
recognised
companion
of
man
occurs
in
the
apocryphal
book
of
tobit
they
went
forth
both
and
the
young
man
dog
with
the
pagan
greeks
and
romans
had
a
kindlier
feeling
for
dumb
animals
than
had
the
jews
their
hounds
like
their
horses
were
selected
with
discrimination
bred
with
care
and
held
in
high
esteem
receiving
pet
names
and
the
literatures
of
greece
and
rome
contain
many
tributes
to
the
courage
obedience
sagacity
and
affectionate
fidelity
of
the
dog
the
phoenicians
too
were
unquestionably
lovers
of
the
dog
quick
to
recognise
the
points
of
special
breeds
in
their
colony
in
carthage
during
the
reign
of
sardanapalus
they
had
already
possessed
themselves
of
the
assyrian
mastiff
which
they
probably
exported
to
britain
as
they
are
said
to
have
exported
the
water
spaniel
to
ireland
and
to
spain
it
is
a
significant
circumstance
when
we
come
to
consider
the
probable
origin
of
the
dog
that
there
are
indications
of
his
domestication
at
such
early
periods
by
so
many
peoples
in
different
parts
of
the
world
as
we
have
seen
dogs
were
more
or
less
subjugated
and
tamed
by
primitive
man
by
the
assyrians
egyptians
phoenicians
greeks
and
romans
as
also
by
the
ancient
barbaric
tribes
of
the
western
hemisphere
the
important
question
now
arises
had
all
these
dogs
a
common
origin
in
a
definite
parent
stock
or
did
they
spring
from
separate
and
unrelated
parents
half
a
century
ago
it
was
believed
that
all
the
evidence
which
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
problem
pointed
to
an
independent
origin
of
the
dog
youatt
writing
in
argued
that
this
power
of
tracing
back
the
dog
to
the
very
earliest
periods
of
history
and
the
fact
that
he
then
seemed
to
be
as
sagacious
as
faithful
and
as
valuable
as
at
the
present
day
strongly
favours
the
opinion
that
he
was
descended
from
no
inferior
and
comparatively
worthless
animal
and
that
he
was
not
the
progeny
of
the
wolf
the
jackal
or
the
fox
but
was
originally
created
somewhat
as
we
now
find
him
the
associate
and
friend
of
man
when
youatt
wrote
most
people
believed
that
the
world
was
only
six
thousand
years
old
and
that
species
were
originally
created
and
absolutely
unchangeable
lyell
discoveries
in
geology
however
overthrew
the
argument
of
the
earth
chronology
and
of
the
antiquity
of
man
and
darwin
theory
of
evolution
entirely
transformed
the
accepted
beliefs
concerning
the
origin
of
species
and
the
supposed
invariability
of
animal
types
the
general
superficial
resemblance
between
the
fox
and
many
of
our
dogs
might
well
excuse
the
belief
in
a
relationship
gamekeepers
are
often
very
positive
that
a
cross
can
be
obtained
between
a
dog
fox
and
a
terrier
bitch
but
cases
in
which
this
connection
is
alleged
must
be
accepted
with
extreme
caution
the
late
bartlett
who
was
for
years
the
superintendent
of
the
zoological
gardens
in
london
studied
this
question
with
minute
care
and
as
a
result
of
experiments
and
observations
he
positively
affirmed
that
he
had
never
met
with
one
instance
of
a
hybrid
dog
and
fox
bartlett
conclusions
are
incontestable
however
much
in
appearance
the
supposed
may
resemble
the
fox
there
are
certain
opposing
characteristics
and
structural
differences
which
entirely
dismiss
the
theory
of
relationship
one
thing
is
certain
that
foxes
do
not
breed
in
confinement
except
in
very
rare
instances
the
silver
fox
of
north
america
is
the
only
species
recorded
to
have
bred
in
the
zoological
gardens
of
london
the
european
fox
has
never
been
known
to
breed
in
captivity
then
again
the
fox
is
not
a
sociable
animal
we
never
hear
of
foxes
uniting
in
a
pack
as
do
the
wolves
the
jackals
and
the
wild
dogs
apart
from
other
considerations
a
fox
may
be
distinguished
from
a
dog
without
being
seen
or
touched
by
its
smell
no
one
can
produce
a
dog
that
has
half
the
odour
of
reynard
and
this
odour
the
would
doubtless
possess
were
its
sire
a
or
its
dam
a
vixen
whatever
may
be
said
concerning
the
difference
existing
between
dogs
and
foxes
will
not
hold
good
in
reference
to
dogs
wolves
and
jackals
the
wolf
and
the
jackal
are
so
much
alike
that
the
only
appreciable
distinction
is
that
of
size
and
so
closely
do
they
resemble
many
dogs
in
general
appearance
structure
habits
instincts
and
mental
endowments
that
no
difficulty
presents
itself
in
regarding
them
as
being
of
one
stock
wolves
and
jackals
can
be
and
have
repeatedly
been
tamed
domestic
dogs
can
become
and
again
and
again
do
become
wild
even
consorting
with
wolves
interbreeding
with
them
assuming
their
gregarious
habits
and
changing
the
characteristic
bark
into
a
dismal
howl
the
wolf
and
the
jackal
when
tamed
answer
to
their
master
call
wag
their
tails
lick
his
hands
crouch
jump
round
him
to
be
caressed
and
throw
themselves
on
their
backs
in
submission
when
in
high
spirits
they
run
round
in
circles
or
in
a
figure
of
eight
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
their
howl
becomes
a
bark
they
smell
at
the
tails
of
other
dogs
and
void
their
urine
sideways
and
lastly
like
our
domestic
favourites
however
refined
and
gentlemanly
in
other
respects
they
can
not
be
broken
of
the
habit
of
rolling
on
carrion
or
on
animals
they
have
killed
this
last
habit
of
the
domestic
dog
is
one
of
the
surviving
traits
of
his
wild
ancestry
which
like
his
habits
of
burying
bones
or
superfluous
food
and
of
turning
round
and
round
on
a
carpet
as
if
to
make
a
nest
for
himself
before
lying
down
go
far
towards
connecting
him
in
direct
relationship
with
the
wolf
and
the
jackal
the
great
multitude
of
different
breeds
of
the
dog
and
the
vast
differences
in
their
size
points
and
general
appearance
are
facts
which
make
it
difficult
to
believe
that
they
could
have
had
a
common
ancestry
one
thinks
of
the
difference
between
the
mastiff
and
the
japanese
spaniel
the
deerhound
and
the
fashionable
pomeranian
the
bernard
and
the
miniature
black
and
tan
terrier
and
is
perplexed
in
contemplating
the
possibility
of
their
having
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
yet
the
disparity
is
no
greater
than
that
between
the
shire
horse
and
the
shetland
pony
the
shorthorn
and
the
kerry
cattle
or
the
patagonian
and
the
pygmy
and
all
dog
breeders
know
how
easy
it
is
to
produce
a
variety
in
type
and
size
by
studied
selection
in
order
properly
to
understand
this
question
it
is
necessary
first
to
consider
the
identity
of
structure
in
the
wolf
and
the
dog
this
identity
of
structure
may
best
be
studied
in
a
comparison
of
the
osseous
system
or
skeletons
of
the
two
animals
which
so
closely
resemble
each
other
that
their
transposition
would
not
easily
be
detected
the
spine
of
the
dog
consists
of
seven
vertebrae
in
the
neck
thirteen
in
the
back
seven
in
the
loins
three
sacral
vertebrae
and
twenty
to
in
the
tail
in
both
the
dog
and
the
wolf
there
are
thirteen
pairs
of
ribs
nine
true
and
four
false
each
has
teeth
they
both
have
five
front
and
four
hind
toes
while
outwardly
the
common
wolf
has
so
much
the
appearance
of
a
large
dog
that
a
popular
description
of
the
one
would
serve
for
the
other
nor
are
their
habits
different
the
wolf
natural
voice
is
a
loud
howl
but
when
confined
with
dogs
he
will
learn
to
bark
although
he
is
carnivorous
he
will
also
eat
vegetables
and
when
sickly
he
will
nibble
grass
in
the
chase
a
pack
of
wolves
will
divide
into
parties
one
following
the
trail
of
the
quarry
the
other
endeavouring
to
intercept
its
retreat
exercising
a
considerable
amount
of
strategy
a
trait
which
is
exhibited
by
many
of
our
sporting
dogs
and
terriers
when
hunting
in
teams
a
further
important
point
of
resemblance
between
the
and
the
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
period
of
gestation
in
both
species
is
days
there
are
from
three
to
nine
cubs
in
a
wolf
litter
and
these
are
blind
for
days
they
are
suckled
for
two
months
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
they
are
able
to
eat
flesh
disgorged
for
them
by
their
dam
or
even
their
sire
we
have
seen
that
there
is
no
authenticated
instance
of
a
hybrid
between
the
dog
and
the
fox
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
dog
and
the
wolf
or
the
dog
and
the
jackal
all
of
which
can
interbreed
moreover
their
offspring
are
fertile
pliny
is
the
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
gauls
tied
their
female
dogs
in
the
wood
that
they
might
cross
with
wolves
the
eskimo
dogs
are
not
infrequently
crossed
with
the
grey
arctic
wolf
which
they
so
much
resemble
and
the
indians
of
america
were
accustomed
to
cross
their
dogs
with
the
coyote
to
impart
greater
boldness
to
the
breed
tame
dogs
living
in
countries
inhabited
by
the
jackal
often
betray
the
jackal
strain
in
their
litters
and
there
are
instances
of
men
dwelling
in
lonely
outposts
of
civilisation
being
molested
by
wolves
or
jackals
following
upon
the
trail
of
a
bitch
in
season
these
facts
lead
one
to
refer
to
the
familiar
circumstance
that
the
native
dogs
of
all
regions
approximate
closely
in
size
coloration
form
and
habit
to
the
native
wolf
of
those
regions
of
this
most
important
circumstance
there
are
far
too
many
instances
to
allow
of
its
being
looked
upon
as
a
mere
coincidence
sir
john
richardson
writing
in
observed
that
the
resemblance
between
the
north
american
wolves
and
the
domestic
dog
of
the
indians
is
so
great
that
the
size
and
strength
of
the
wolf
seems
to
be
the
only
difference
i
have
more
than
once
mistaken
a
band
of
wolves
for
the
dogs
of
a
party
of
indians
and
the
howl
of
the
animals
of
both
species
is
prolonged
so
exactly
in
the
same
key
that
even
the
practised
ear
of
the
indian
fails
at
times
to
discriminate
between
them
as
the
eskimo
and
indian
dogs
resemble
the
north
american
wolf
so
the
dog
of
the
hare
indians
a
very
different
breed
resembles
the
prairie
wolf
except
in
the
matter
of
barking
there
is
no
difference
whatever
between
the
black
of
the
indians
of
florida
and
the
wolves
of
the
same
country
the
same
phenomenon
is
seen
in
many
kinds
of
european
dogs
the
shepherd
dog
of
the
plains
of
hungary
is
white
or
has
a
sharp
nose
short
erect
ears
shaggy
coat
and
bushy
tail
and
so
much
resembles
a
wolf
that
paget
who
gives
the
description
says
he
has
known
a
hungarian
mistake
a
wolf
for
one
of
his
own
dogs
many
of
the
dogs
of
russia
lapland
and
finland
are
comparable
with
the
wolves
of
those
countries
some
of
the
domestic
dogs
of
egypt
both
at
the
present
day
and
in
the
condition
of
mummies
are
in
type
and
the
dogs
of
nubia
have
the
closest
relation
to
a
wild
species
of
the
same
region
which
is
only
a
form
of
the
common
jackal
dogs
it
may
again
be
noted
cross
with
the
jackal
as
well
as
with
wolves
and
this
is
frequently
the
case
in
africa
as
for
example
in
bosjesmans
where
the
dogs
have
a
marked
resemblance
to
the
jackal
which
is
a
south
african
variety
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
one
incontrovertible
argument
against
the
lupine
relationship
of
the
dog
is
the
fact
that
all
domestic
dogs
bark
while
all
wild
express
their
feelings
only
by
howls
but
the
difficulty
here
is
not
so
great
as
it
seems
since
we
know
that
jackals
wild
dogs
and
wolf
pups
reared
by
bitches
readily
acquire
the
habit
on
the
other
hand
domestic
dogs
allowed
to
run
wild
forget
how
to
bark
while
there
are
some
which
have
not
yet
learned
so
to
express
themselves
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
habit
of
barking
can
not
then
be
regarded
as
an
argument
in
deciding
the
question
concerning
the
origin
of
the
dog
this
stumbling
block
consequently
disappears
leaving
us
in
the
position
of
agreeing
with
darwin
whose
final
hypothesis
was
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
domestic
dogs
of
the
world
have
descended
from
two
good
species
of
wolf
and
and
from
two
or
three
other
doubtful
species
of
wolves
namely
the
european
indian
and
north
african
forms
from
at
least
one
or
two
south
american
canine
species
from
several
races
or
species
of
jackal
and
perhaps
from
one
or
more
extinct
species
and
that
the
blood
of
these
in
some
cases
mingled
together
flows
in
the
veins
of
our
domestic
breeds
chapter
ii
the
english
mastiff
of
the
many
different
kinds
of
dogs
now
established
as
british
not
a
few
have
had
their
origin
in
other
lands
whence
specimens
have
been
imported
into
this
country
in
course
of
time
to
be
so
improved
by
selection
that
they
have
come
to
be
commonly
accepted
as
native
breeds
some
are
protected
from
the
claim
that
they
are
indigenous
by
the
fact
that
their
origin
is
indicated
in
their
names
no
one
would
pretend
that
the
bernard
or
the
newfoundland
the
spaniel
or
the
dalmatian
are
of
native
breed
they
are
alien
immigrants
whom
we
have
naturalised
as
we
are
naturalising
the
majestic
great
dane
the
decorative
borzoi
the
alert
schipperke
and
the
frowning
chow
chow
which
are
of
such
recent
introduction
that
they
must
still
be
regarded
as
foreigners
but
of
the
antiquity
of
the
mastiff
there
can
be
no
doubt
he
is
the
oldest
of
our
british
dogs
cultivated
in
these
islands
for
so
many
centuries
that
the
only
difficulty
concerning
his
history
is
that
of
tracing
his
descent
and
discovering
the
period
when
he
was
not
familiarly
known
it
is
possible
that
the
mastiff
owes
his
origin
to
some
remote
ancestor
of
alien
strain
the
assyrian
kings
possessed
a
large
dog
of
decided
mastiff
type
and
used
it
in
the
hunting
of
lions
it
is
supposed
by
many
students
that
the
breed
was
introduced
into
early
britain
by
the
adventurous
phoenician
traders
who
in
the
sixth
century
voyaged
to
the
scilly
islands
and
cornwall
to
barter
their
own
commodities
in
exchange
for
the
useful
metals
knowing
the
requirements
of
their
barbarian
customers
these
early
merchants
from
tyre
and
sidon
are
believed
to
have
brought
some
of
the
larger
which
would
be
readily
accepted
by
the
britons
to
supplant
or
improve
their
courageous
but
undersized
fighting
dogs
in
times
every
two
villeins
were
required
to
maintain
one
of
these
dogs
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
number
of
wolves
and
other
wild
animals
this
would
indicate
that
the
mastiff
was
recognised
as
a
capable
hunting
dog
but
at
a
later
period
his
hunting
instincts
were
not
highly
esteemed
and
he
was
not
regarded
as
a
peril
to
preserved
game
for
in
the
reign
of
henry
iii
the
forest
laws
which
prohibited
the
keeping
of
all
other
breeds
by
unprivileged
persons
permitted
the
mastiff
to
come
within
the
precincts
of
a
forest
imposing
however
the
condition
that
every
such
dog
should
have
the
claws
of
the
removed
close
to
the
skin
the
name
mastiff
was
probably
applied
to
any
massively
built
dog
it
is
not
easy
to
trace
the
true
breed
amid
the
various
names
which
it
owned
molossus
alan
alaunt
bandog
or
were
among
the
number
the
names
and
bandog
intimate
that
the
mastiff
was
commonly
kept
for
guard
but
many
were
specially
trained
for
baiting
bears
imported
lions
and
bulls
there
is
constant
record
of
the
mastiff
having
been
kept
and
carefully
bred
for
many
generations
in
certain
old
english
families
one
of
the
oldest
strains
of
mastiffs
was
that
kept
by
legh
of
lyme
hall
in
cheshire
they
were
large
powerful
dogs
and
longer
in
muzzle
than
those
which
we
are
now
accustomed
to
see
another
old
and
valuable
strain
was
kept
by
the
duke
of
devonshire
at
chatsworth
it
is
to
these
two
strains
that
the
dogs
of
the
present
day
trace
back
woolmore
crown
prince
was
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
mastiffs
he
was
a
fawn
dog
with
a
dudley
nose
and
light
eye
and
was
pale
in
muzzle
and
whilst
full
credit
must
be
given
to
him
for
having
sired
many
good
mastiffs
he
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
faults
in
many
specimens
of
more
recent
years
unfortunately
he
was
indiscriminately
bred
from
with
the
result
that
in
a
very
short
time
breeders
found
it
impossible
to
find
a
mastiff
unrelated
to
him
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
ever
since
his
era
there
has
been
a
perceptible
diminution
in
the
number
of
good
examples
of
this
fine
old
english
breed
and
that
from
being
an
admired
and
fashionable
dog
the
mastiff
has
so
declined
in
popularity
that
few
are
to
be
seen
either
at
exhibitions
or
in
breeders
kennels
at
the
crystal
palace
in
there
were
as
many
as
mastiffs
on
show
forming
a
line
of
benches
two
hundred
yards
long
and
not
a
bad
one
among
them
whereas
at
a
dog
show
held
years
later
where
more
than
twelve
hundred
dogs
were
entered
not
a
single
mastiff
was
benched
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
dogs
of
unblemished
pedigree
and
superlative
type
may
partly
account
for
this
decline
and
another
reason
of
unpopularity
may
be
that
the
mastiff
requires
so
much
attention
to
keep
him
in
condition
that
without
it
he
is
apt
to
become
indolent
and
heavy
nevertheless
the
mischief
of
breeding
too
continuously
from
one
strain
such
as
that
of
crown
prince
has
to
some
extent
been
eradicated
and
we
have
had
many
splendid
mastiffs
since
his
time
special
mention
should
be
made
of
that
grand
bitch

mastiffs
it
is
not
so
necessary
that
the
dogs
themselves
should
be
so
large
as
that
they
come
from
a
large
strain
the
weight
of
a
dog
should
be
anything
over
lb
many
have
turned
over
the
scale
at
lb
the
shah
for
instance
was
lb
in
weight
scawfell
over
lb
one
of
the
great
difficulties
that
breeders
of
mastiffs
and
all
other
large
dogs
have
to
contend
against
is
in
rearing
the
puppies
so
many
bitches
being
clumsy
and
apt
to
kill
the
whelps
by
lying
on
them
it
is
therefore
always
better
to
be
provided
with
one
or
more
foster
bitches
at
about
six
weeks
old
a
fairly
good
opinion
may
be
formed
as
to
what
the
puppies
will
ultimately
turn
out
in
certain
respects
for
although
they
may
change
materially
during
growth
the
good
or
bad
qualities
which
are
manifest
at
that
early
age
will
in
all
probability
be
apparent
when
the
puppy
has
reached
maturity
it
is
therefore
frequently
easier
to
select
the
best
puppy
in
the
nest
than
to
do
so
when
they
are
from
six
to
nine
or
ten
months
old
puppies
should
be
allowed
all
the
liberty
possible
and
never
be
tied
up
they
should
be
taken
out
for
steady
gentle
exercise
and
not
permitted
to
get
too
fat
or
they
become
too
heavy
with
detrimental
results
to
their
legs
many
mastiff
puppies
are
very
shy
and
nervous
but
they
will
grow
out
of
this
if
kindly
handled
and
eventually
become
the
best
guard
and
protector
it
is
possible
to
have
the
temper
of
a
mastiff
should
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
breeder
they
are
as
a
rule
possessed
of
the
best
of
tempers
a
savage
dog
with
such
power
as
the
mastiff
possesses
is
indeed
a
dangerous
creature
and
therefore
some
inquiries
as
to
the
temper
of
a
stud
dog
should
be
made
before
deciding
to
use
him
in
these
dogs
as
in
all
others
it
is
a
question
of
how
they
are
treated
by
the
person
having
charge
of
them
the
feeding
of
puppies
is
an
important
matter
and
should
be
carefully
seen
to
by
anyone
wishing
to
rear
them
successfully
if
goat
milk
is
procurable
it
is
preferable
to
cow
milk
the
price
asked
for
it
is
sometimes
prohibitory
but
this
difficulty
may
be
surmounted
in
many
cases
by
keeping
a
goat
or
two
on
the
premises
many
breeders
have
obtained
a
goat
with
the
sole
object
of
rearing
a
litter
of
puppies
on
her
milk
and
have
eventually
discarded
cow
milk
altogether
using
goat
milk
for
household
purposes
instead
as
soon
as
the
puppies
will
lap
they
should
be
induced
to
take
arrowroot
prepared
with
milk
oatmeal
and
maizemeal
about
one
quarter
of
the
latter
to
three
quarters
of
the
former
make
a
good
food
for
puppies
dog
biscuits
and
the
various
hound
meals
soaked
in
good
broth
may
be
used
with
advantage
but
no
dogs
either
large
or
small
can
be
kept
in
condition
for
any
length
of
time
without
a
fair
proportion
of
meat
of
some
kind
sheep
paunches
cleaned
and
well
boiled
mixed
with
sweet
stale
bread
previously
soaked
in
cold
water
make
an
excellent
food
and
can
hardly
be
excelled
as
a
staple
diet
in
feeding
on
horseflesh
care
should
be
taken
to
ascertain
that
the
horse
was
not
diseased
especially
if
any
is
given
uncooked
worms
are
a
constant
source
of
trouble
from
the
earliest
days
of
and
no
puppy
suffering
from
them
will
thrive
every
effort
therefore
should
be
made
to
get
rid
of
them
with
proper
feeding
grooming
exercise
and
cleanliness
any
large
dog
can
be
kept
in
good
condition
without
resort
to
medicine
the
use
of
which
should
be
strictly
prohibited
unless
there
is
real
need
for
it
mastiffs
kept
under
such
conditions
are
far
more
likely
to
prove
successful
stud
dogs
and
brood
bitches
than
those
to
which
deleterious
drugs
are
constantly
being
given
chapter
iii
the
bulldog
the
bulldog
is
known
to
have
been
domiciled
in
this
country
for
several
centuries
like
the
mastiff
of
which
it
is
a
smaller
form
it
is
a
descendant
of
the
alaunt
mastive
or
bandog
described
by
caius
who
states
that
the
mastyve
or
bandogge
is
vaste
huge
stubborne
ougly
and
eager
of
a
hevy
and
burthenous
body
and
therefore
but
of
little
swiftnesse
terrible
and
frightful
to
beholde
and
more
fearce
and
fell
than
any
arcadian
curre
the
first
mention
of
bulldog
as
the
distinctive
name
of
this
now
national
breed
occurs
in
a
letter
written
by
prestwich
eaton
from
sebastian
to
george
wellingham
in
swithin
lane
london
in
or
for
a
good
mastive
dogge
a
case
of
bottles
replenished
with
the
best
lickour
and
pray
proceur
mee
two
good
bulldoggs
and
let
them
be
sent
by
ye
first
shipp
obviously
the
name
was
derived
from
the
dog
association
with
the
sport
of
the
object
aimed
at
in
that
pursuit
was
that
the
dog
should
pin
and
hold
the
bull
by
the
muzzle
and
not
leave
it
the
bull
was
naturally
helpless
when
seized
in
his
most
tender
part
as
he
lowered
his
head
in
order
to
use
his
horns
it
was
necessary
for
the
dog
to
keep
close
to
the
ground
or
in
the
words
of
the
old
fanciers
of
the
sport
to
play
low
larger
dogs
were
at
a
disadvantage
in
this
respect
and
therefore
those
of
smaller
proportions
which
were
quite
as
suitable
for
the
sport
were
selected
the
average
height
of
the
dogs
was
about
inches
and
the
weight
was
generally
about
whilst
the
body
was
broad
muscular
and
compact
as
is
shown
in
scott
engraving
of
crib
and
rosa
when
was
prohibited
by
law
the
sportsmen
of
the
period
turned
their
attention
to
and
for
this
pastime
the
bulldogs
were
specially
trained
the
chief
centres
in
london
where
these
exhibitions
took
place
were
the
westminster
pit
the
bear
garden
at
bankside
and
the
old
conduit
fields
in
bayswater
in
order
to
obtain
greater
quickness
of
movement
many
of
the
bulldogs
were
crossed
with
a
terrier
although
some
fanciers
relied
on
the
pure
breed
it
is
recorded
that
lord
camelford
bulldog
belcher
fought
one
hundred
and
four
battles
without
once
suffering
defeat
the
decline
of
and
after
the
passing
of
the
bill
prohibiting
these
sports
was
responsible
for
a
lack
of
interest
in
perpetuating
the
breed
of
bulldogs
even
in
it
was
said
to
be
degenerating
and
gentlemen
who
had
previously
been
the
chief
breeders
gradually
deserted
the
fancy
at
one
time
it
was
stated
that
wasp
child
and
billy
who
were
of
the
duke
of
strain
were
the
only
remaining
bulldogs
in
existence
and
that
upon
their
decease
the
bulldog
would
become
extinct
a
prophecy
which
all
bulldog
lovers
happily
find
incorrect
the
specimens
alive
in
as
seen
in
prints
of
that
period
were
not
so
cloddy
as
those
met
with
at
the
present
day
still
the
outline
of
rosa
in
the
engraving
of
crib
and
rosa
is
considered
to
represent
perfection
in
the
shape
make
and
size
of
the
ideal
type
of
bulldog
the
only
objections
which
have
been
taken
are
that
the
bitch
is
deficient
in
wrinkles
about
the
head
and
neck
and
in
substance
of
bone
in
the
limbs
the
commencement
of
the
era
in
enabled
classes
to
be
provided
for
bulldogs
and
a
fresh
incentive
to
breed
them
was
offered
to
the
dog
fancier
in
certain
districts
of
the
country
notably
in
london
birmingham
sheffield
manchester
and
dudley
a
number
of
fanciers
resided
and
it
is
to
their
efforts
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
varied
specimens
of
the
breed
that
are
to
be
seen
at
the
present
time
in
forming
a
judgment
of
a
bulldog
the
general
appearance
is
of
most
importance
as
the
various
points
of
the
dog
should
be
symmetrical
and
well
balanced
no
one
point
being
in
excess
of
the
others
so
as
to
destroy
the
impression
of
determination
strength
and
activity
which
is
conveyed
by
the
typical
specimen
his
body
should
be
thickset
rather
low
in
stature
but
broad
powerful
and
compact
the
head
should
be
strikingly
massive
and
large
in
proportion
to
the
dog
size
it
can
not
be
too
large
so
long
as
it
is
square
that
is
it
must
not
be
wider
than
it
is
deep
the
larger
the
head
in
circumference
caused
by
the
prominent
cheeks
the
greater
the
quantity
of
muscle
to
hold
the
jaws
together
the
head
should
be
of
great
depth
from
the
occiput
to
the
base
of
the
lower
jaw
and
should
not
in
any
way
be
or
peaked
in
circumference
the
skull
should
measure
in
front
of
the
ears
at
least
the
height
of
the
dog
at
the
shoulders
the
cheeks
should
be
well
rounded
extend
sideways
beyond
the
eyes
and
be
well
furnished
with
muscle
length
of
skull
that
is
the
distance
between
the
eye
and
the
ear
is
very
desirable
the
forehead
should
be
flat
and
the
skin
upon
it
and
about
the
head
very
loose
hanging
in
large
wrinkles
the
temples
or
frontal
bones
should
be
very
prominent
broad
square
and
high
causing
a
wide
and
deep
groove
known
as
the
stop
between
the
eyes
and
should
extend
up
the
middle
of
the
forehead
dividing
the
head
vertically
being
traceable
at
the
top
of
the
skull
the
expression
well
broken
up
is
used
where
this
stop
and
furrow
are
well
marked
and
if
there
is
the
attendant
looseness
of
skin
the
animal
expression
is
well
finished
the
face
when
measured
from
the
front
of
the
to
the
nose
should
be
short
and
its
skin
should
be
deeply
and
closely
wrinkled
excessive
shortness
of
face
is
not
natural
and
can
only
be
obtained
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
chop
such
shortness
of
face
makes
the
dog
appear
smaller
in
head
and
less
formidable
than
he
otherwise
would
be
formerly
this
shortness
of
face
was
artificially
obtained
by
the
use
of
the
jack
an
atrocious
form
of
torture
by
which
an
iron
instrument
was
used
to
force
back
the
face
by
means
of
thumbscrews
the
nose
should
be
rough
large
broad
and
black
and
this
colour
should
extend
to
the
lower
lip
its
top
should
be
deeply
set
back
almost
between
the
eyes
the
distance
from
the
inner
corner
of
the
eye
to
the
extreme
tip
of
the
nose
should
not
be
greater
than
the
length
from
the
tip
of
the
nose
to
the
edge
of
the
under
lip
the
nostrils
should
be
large
and
wide
with
a
straight
line
visible
between
them
the
largeness
of
nostril
which
is
a
very
desirable
property
is
possessed
by
few
of
the
recent
when
viewed
in
profile
the
tip
of
the
nose
should
touch
an
imaginary
line
drawn
from
the
extremity
of
the
lower
jaw
to
the
top
of
the
centre
of
the
skull
this
angle
of
the
nose
and
face
is
known
as
the
and
can
only
properly
be
ascertained
by
viewing
the
dog
from
the
side
the
inclination
backward
of
the
nose
allows
a
free
passage
of
the
air
into
the
nostrils
whilst
the
dog
is
holding
his
quarry
it
is
apparent
that
if
the
mouth
did
not
project
beyond
the
nose
the
nostrils
would
be
flat
against
the
part
to
which
the
dog
was
fixed
and
breathing
would
then
be
stopped
the
upper
lip
called
the
chop
or
flews
should
be
thick
broad
pendant
and
very
deep
hanging
completely
over
the
lower
jaw
at
the
sides
but
only
just
joining
the
under
lip
in
front
yet
covering
the
teeth
completely
the
amount
of
cushion
which
a
dog
may
have
is
dependent
upon
the
thickness
of
the
flews
the
lips
should
not
be
pendulous
the
upper
jaw
should
be
broad
massive
and
square
the
tusks
being
wide
apart
whilst
the
lower
jaw
being
turned
upwards
should
project
in
front
of
the
upper
the
teeth
should
be
large
and
strong
and
the
six
small
teeth
between
the
tusks
should
be
in
an
even
row
the
upper
jaw
can
not
be
too
broad
between
the
tusks
if
the
upper
and
lower
jaws
are
level
and
the
muzzle
is
not
turned
upwards
the
dog
is
said
to
be
whilst
if
the
underjaw
is
not
undershot
he
is
said
to
be
froggy
a
dog
is
one
having
the
lower
jaw
twisted
and
this
deformity
so
detracts
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
dog
as
seriously
to
handicap
him
in
the
the
underjaw
projects
beyond
the
upper
in
order
to
allow
the
dog
when
running
directly
to
the
front
to
grasp
the
bull
and
when
fixed
to
give
him
a
firmer
hold
the
eyes
seen
from
the
front
should
be
situated
low
down
in
the
skull
as
far
from
the
ears
the
nose
and
each
other
as
possible
but
quite
in
front
of
the
forehead
so
long
as
their
corners
are
in
a
straight
line
at
right
angles
with
the
stop
and
in
front
of
the
forehead
they
should
be
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
base
of
the
nasal
bone
and
should
be
quite
round
in
shape
of
moderate
size
neither
sunken
nor
prominent
and
be
as
black
in
colour
as
possible
almost
if
not
quite
black
showing
no
white
when
looking
directly
to
the
front
a
good
deal
of
a
bulldog
appearance
depends
on
the
quality
shape
and
carriage
of
his
ears
they
should
be
small
and
thin
and
set
high
on
the
head
that
is
the
front
inner
edge
of
each
ear
should
as
viewed
from
the
front
join
the
outline
of
the
skull
at
the
top
corner
of
such
outline
so
as
to
place
them
as
wide
apart
as
high
and
as
far
from
the
eyes
as
possible
the
shape
should
be
that
which
is
known
as
rose
in
which
the
ear
folds
inward
at
the
back
the
upper
or
front
edge
curving
over
outwards
and
backwards
showing
part
of
the
inside
of
the
burr
if
the
ears
are
placed
low
on
the
skull
they
give
an
appleheaded
appearance
to
the
dog
if
the
ear
falls
in
front
hiding
the
interior
as
is
the
case
with
a
it
is
said
to
button
and
this
type
is
highly
objectionable
unfortunately
within
the
last
few
years
the
button
and
ear
have
been
rather
prevalent
amongst
the
specimens
on
the
show
bench
if
the
ear
is
carried
erect
it
is
known
as
a
tulip
ear
and
this
form
also
is
objectionable
nevertheless
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
two
out
of
every
three
dogs
possessed
ears
of
this
description
the
neck
should
be
moderate
in
length
very
thick
deep
muscular
and
short
but
of
sufficient
length
to
allow
it
to
be
well
arched
at
the
back
commencing
at
the
junction
with
the
skull
there
should
be
plenty
of
loose
thick
and
wrinkled
skin
about
the
throat
forming
a
dewlap
on
each
side
from
the
lower
jaw
to
the
chest
the
chest
should
be
very
wide
laterally
round
prominent
and
deep
making
the
dog
appear
very
broad
and
in
front
the
shoulders
should
be
broad
the
blades
sloping
considerably
from
the
body
they
should
be
deep
very
powerful
and
muscular
and
should
be
flat
at
the
top
and
play
loosely
from
the
chest
the
brisket
should
be
capacious
round
and
very
deep
from
the
shoulder
to
the
lowest
part
where
it
joins
the
chest
and
be
well
let
down
between
the
it
should
be
large
in
diameter
and
round
behind
the
neither
nor
sinking
which
it
will
not
do
provided
that
the
first
and
succeeding
ribs
are
well
rounded
the
belly
should
be
well
tucked
up
and
not
pendulous
a
small
narrow
waist
being
greatly
admired
the
desired
object
in
body
formation
is
to
obtain
great
girth
at
the
brisket
and
the
smallest
possible
around
the
waist
that
is
the
loins
should
be
arched
very
high
when
the
dog
is
said
to
have
a
good
the
back
should
be
short
and
strong
very
broad
at
the
shoulder
and
comparatively
narrow
at
the
loins
the
back
should
rise
behind
the
shoulders
in
a
graceful
curve
to
the
loins
the
top
of
which
should
be
higher
than
the
top
of
the
shoulders
thence
curving

is
essentially
a
characteristic
of
the
breed

unfortunately
many
leading
of
the
present
day
are
entirely
deficient
in
this
respect
some
dogs
dip
very
considerably
some
distance
behind
the

before
the

of
the
spine

otherwise
it
is
known
as
the
ideal
length
of
tail
is
about
six
inches
many
fanciers
demand
a
screw
or
kinked

that
is

congenital
dislocations
at
the

such

opinions

one

will
set

whilst

occasionally
one
comes
across
specimens
having
a
colour
which
although
not
mentioned
in
the
recognised
standard
as
being
debarred
do
not
as
a
rule
figure
in
the
prize
list
some
of
the
best
specimens
which
the
writer
has
seen
have
been
and
a
few
years
ago
on
the
award
of
a
first
prize
to
a
bitch
of
this
colour
a
long
but
argument
was
held
in
the
canine
press
granted
that
the
colour
is
objectionable
a
dog
which
scores
in
all
other
properties
should
not
be
put
down
for
this
point
alone
seeing
that
in
the
days
there
were
many
specimens
of
this
colour
in
action
the
bulldog
should
have
a
peculiarly
heavy
and
constrained
gait
a
rolling
or
slouching
movement
appearing
to
walk
with
short
quick
steps
on
the
tip
of
his
toes
his
not
being
lifted
high
but
appearing
to
skim
the
ground
and
running
with
the
right
shoulder
rather
advanced
similar
to
the
manner
of
a
horse
when
cantering
the
foregoing
minute
description
of
the
various
show
points
of
a
bulldog
indicates
that
he
should
have
the
appearance
of
a
ayrshire
or
highland
bull
in
stature
he
should
be
low
to
the
ground
broad
and
compact
the
body
being
carried
between
and
not
on
the
he
should
stand
over
a
great
deal
of
ground
and
have
the
appearance
of
immense
power
the
height
of
the
should
not
exceed
the
distance
from
the
elbow
to
the
centre
of
the
back
between
the
shoulder
blades
considerable
importance
is
attached
to
the
freedom
and
activity
displayed
by
the
animal
in
its
movements
deformed
joints
or
weakness
are
very
objectionable
the
head
should
be
strikingly
massive
and
carried
low
the
face
short
the
muzzle
very
broad
blunt
and
inclined
upwards
the
body
should
be
short
and
the
limbs
stout
and
muscular
the
should
be
very
high
and
strong
but
rather
lightly
made
in
comparison
with
the
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
there
are
many
strains
of
this
breed
which
are
constitutionally
unsound
for
this
reason
it
is
important
that
the
novice
should
give
very
careful
consideration
to
his
first
purchase
of
a
bulldog
he
should
ascertain
beyond
all
doubt
not
only
that
his
proposed
purchase
is
itself
sound
in
wind
and
limb
but
that
its
sire
and
dam
are
and
have
been
in
similarly
healthy
condition
the
dog
to
be
chosen
should
be
physically
strong
and
show
pronounced
muscular
development
if
these
requirements
are
present
and
the
dog
is
in
no
sense
a
contradiction
of
the
good
qualities
of
its
progenitors
but
a
justification
of
its
pedigree
care
and
good
treatment
will
do
the
rest
it
is
to
be
remembered
however
that
a
bulldog
may
be
improved
by
judicious
exercise
when
at
exercise
or
taking
a
walk
with
his
owner
the
young
dog
should
always
be
held
by
a
leash
he
will
invariably
pull
vigorously
against
this
restraint
but
such
action
is
beneficial
as
it
tends
to
develop
the
muscles
of
the
shoulders
and
front
of
the
body
when
taking
up
the
bulldog
fancy
nine
out
of
every
ten
novices
choose
to
purchase
a
male
the
contrary
course
should
be
adopted
the
female
is
an
equally
good
companion
in
the
house
or
on
the
road
she
is
not
less
affectionate
and
faithful
and
when
the
inevitable
desire
to
attempt
to
reproduce
the
species
is
reached
the
beginner
has
the
means
at
once
available
it
is
always
difficult
for
the
uninitiated
to
select
what
is
likely
to
be
a
good
dog
from
the
nest
in
choosing
a
puppy
care
should
be
taken
to
ensure
it
has
plenty
of
bone
in
its
limbs
and
these
should
be
fairly
short
and
wide
the
nostrils
should
be
large
and
the
face
as
short
as
possible
the
chop
should
be
thick
and
heavily
wrinkled
and
the
mouth
square
there
should
be
a
distinct
indent
in
the
upper
jaw
where
the
bone
will
eventually
curve
whilst
the
lower
jaw
should
show
signs
of
curvature
and
protrude
slightly
in
front
of
the
upper
jaw
the
teeth
from
canine
to
canine
including
the
six
front
teeth
should
be
in
a
straight
line
see
that
the
ears
are
very
small
and
thin
and
the
eyes
set
well
apart
the
puppy
having
these
properties
together
with
a
domed
peaked
or
cocoanut
shaped
skull
is
the
one
which
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
will
eventually
make
the
best
headed
dog
of
the
litter
the
breeding
of
bulldogs
requires
unlimited
patience
as
success
is
very
difficult
to
attain
the
breeder
who
can
rear
five
out
of
every
ten
puppies
born
may
be
considered
fortunate
it
is
frequently
found
in
what
appears
to
be
a
healthy
lot
of
puppies
that
some
of
them
begin
to
whine
and
whimper
towards
the
end
of
the
first
day
and
in
such
cases
the
writer
experience
is
that
there
will
be
a
speedy
burial
it
may
be
that
the
cause
is
due
to
some
acidity
of
the
milk
but
in
such
a
case
one
would
expect
that
similar
difficulty
would
be
experienced
with
the
remainder
of
the
litter
but
this
is
not
the
usual
result
provided
that
the
puppies
can
be
kept
alive
until
the
fourth
day
it
may
be
taken
that
the
chances
are
well
in
favour

ultimate
success

many
breeders
object
to
feeding
the
mother
with
meat
at
this
time
but
the
writer
once
had
two
litter
sisters
who
whelped
on
the
same
day
and
he
decided
to
try
the
effect
of
a
meat
farinaceous
diet
upon
them
as
a
result
the
bitch
who
was
freely
fed
with
raw
beef
reared
a
stronger
lot
of
puppies
showing
better
developed
bone
than
did
the
one
who
was
fed
on
milk
and
cereals
similarly
in
order
that
the
puppy
after
weaning
may
develop
plenty
of
bone
and
muscle
it
is
advisable
to
feed
once
a
day
upon
finely
minced
raw
meat
there
are
some
successful
breeders
indeed
who
invariably
give
to
each
puppy
a
teaspoonful
of
cod
liver
oil
in
the
morning
and
a
similar
dose
of
extract
of
malt
in
the
evening
with
the
result
that
there
are
never
any
rickety
or
weak
dogs
in
the
kennels
whilst
the
development
of
the
bones
in
the
skull
and
limbs
is
most
pronounced
owing
to
their
lethargic
disposition
young
bulldogs
are
somewhat
liable
to
indigestion
and
during
the
period
of
puppyhood
it
is
of
advantage
to
give
them
a
tablespoonful
of
lime
water
once
a
day
in
their
milk
food
many
novices
are
in
doubt
as
to
the
best
time
to
breed
from
a
bull
bitch
seeing
that
oestrum
is
present
before
she
is
fully
developed
it
may
be
taken
as
practically
certain
that
it
is
better
for
her
to
be
allowed
to
breed
at
her
first
heat
nature
has
so
arranged
matters
that
a
bull
bitch
is
not
firmly
set
in
her
bones
until
she
reaches
an
age
of
from
twelve
to
eighteen
months
and
therefore
she
will
have
less
difficulty
in
giving
birth
to
her
offspring
if
she
be
allowed
to
breed
at
this
time
great
mortality
occurs
in
attempting
to
breed
from
maiden
bitches
exceeding
three
years
of
age
as
the
writer
knows
to
his
cost
it
is
desirable
in
the
case
of
a
young
bitch
having
her
first
litter
for
her
master
or
mistress
to
be
near
her
at
the
time
in
order
to
render
any
necessary
assistance
but
such
attentions
should
not
be
given
unless
actual
necessity
arises
some
bitches
with
excessive
and
shortness
of
face
have
at
times
a
difficulty
in
releasing
the
puppy
from
the
membrane
in
which
it
is
born
and
in
such
a
case
it
is
necessary
for
the
owner
to
open
this
covering
and
release
the
puppy
gently
shaking
it
about
in
the
box
until
it
coughs
and
begins
to
breathe
the
umbilical
cord
should
be
severed
from
the
afterbirth
about
four
inches
from
the
puppy
and
this
will
dry
up
and
fall
away
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days
in
general
it
is
true
economy
for
the
bulldog
breeder
to
provide
a
in
readiness
for
the
birth
of
the
expected
litter
especially
is
this
so
in
the
case
of
a
first
litter
when
the
qualifications
for
nursing
by
the
mother
are
unknown
where
there
are
more
than
five
puppies
it
is
also
desirable
to
obtain
a
in
order
that
full
nourishment
may
be
given
to
the
litter
by
both
mothers
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
puppies
to
be
born
is
in
the
spring
when
owing
to
the
approaching
warm
weather
they
can
lead
an
outdoor
life
by
the
time
they
are
six
months
old
they
should
have
sufficient
stamina
to
enable
them
to
withstand
the
cold
of
the
succeeding
winter
it
has
been
ascertained
that
bulldogs
which
have
been
reared
out
of
doors
are
the
least
liable
to
suffer
from
indigestion
torpidity
of
the
liver
asthma
or
other
chest
ailments
whilst
they
invariably
have
the
hardiest
constitution
bulldogs
generally
require
liberal
feeding
and
should
have
a
meal
of
dry
biscuit
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
whilst
the
evening
meal
should
consist
of
a
good
stew
of
butcher
offal
poured
over
broken
biscuit
bread
or
other
cereal
food
in
the
winter
time
it
is
advantageous
to
soak
a
tablespoonful
of
linseed
in
water
overnight
and
after
the
pods
have
opened
to
turn
the
resulting
jelly
into
the
stew
pot
this
ensures
a
fine
glossy
coat
and
is
of
value
in
toning
up
the
intestines
care
must
however
be
taken
not
to
follow
this
practice
to
excess
in
warm
weather
as
the
heating
nature
of
the
linseed
will
eventually
cause
skin

points

no

in

fancier
owner
and
breeder
in
conclusion
it
can
not
be
too
widely
known
that
the
bulldog
is
one
of
the
very
few
breeds
which
can
with
perfect
safety
be
trusted
alone
to
the
mercy
of
children
who
naturally
in
the
course
of
play

the
patience
and
good
temper
of

firmest
friend

or
sixty

rather
as
a
recent
edict

common
objects
of
the
canine
in
fact
you
can
hardly
ever
talk
for
ten
minutes
to
any
bulldog
breeder
of
old
standing
without
his
telling
you
tall
stories
of
the
wonderful
little
bulldogs
weighing
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
pounds
he
either
knew
or
owned
in
those
days
prominent
among
those
who
made
a
cult
of
these
bantams
were
the
laceworkers
of
nottingham
and
many
prints
are
extant
which
bear
witness
to
the
excellent
little
specimens
they
bred
but
a
wave
of
unpopularity
overwhelmed
them
and
they
faded
across
the
channel
to
france
where
if
as
is
asserted
our
gallic
neighbours
appreciated
them
highly
they
can
not
be
said
to
have
taken
much
care
to
preserve
their
best
points
when
in
a
small
but
devoted
band
of
admirers
revived
them
in

returned

true
but
hampered
by
many
undesirable
features
such
as
bat
ears
froggy
faces
waving
tails
and
a
general
lack
of
bulldog
character
however
the
toy

club
then
started
took
the
dogs
vigorously
in
hand

thanks
to
unceasing
efforts

have
always
since
been
catered
for
at
an
ever
increasing
number
of
shows
their
weight
after
much
heated
discussion
and
sundry
downs
and
ups
was
finally
fixed
at
pounds
and
under
the
original
aim
of
miniature
bulldogs
to
look
like
the
larger
variety
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
if
not
actually
achieved
is
being
rapidly
approached
and
can
no
longer
be
looked
upon
as
merely
the
hopeless
dream
of
a
few
enthusiasts
to
enumerate
in
detail
the
miniature
bulldog
scale
of
points
is
quite
unnecessary
as
it
is
simply
that
of
the
big
ones
writ
small
in
other
words
the
general
appearance
of
the
miniature
bulldog
must
as
nearly
as
possible

bulldog

terse
sentence
which
comprises
in
itself
all
that
can
be
said
on
the
subject
as

friends
miniature
bulldogs
are
faithful
fond
and
even
foolish
in
their
devotion
as
all
true

be
they
are
absolutely
and
invariably
and
as
a

sufficiently
fond
of
the
luxuries
of
this

to
say
greedy
to
be
easily
cajoled
into
obedience
remarkably
intelligent

caring
enough
for

be
sympathetically
excited

the

exercise
without
requiring
an
exhausting
amount
they
are
in
every
way
ideal
pets
and
adapt
themselves
to
town
and
country
alike
as
puppies
they
are
delicate
and
require
constant
care
and
supervision
but
that
only
adds
a
keener
zest
to
the
attractive
task
of
breeding
them
the
more
so
owing
to
the
fact
that
as
mothers
they
do
not
shine
being
very
difficult
to
manage
and
generally
manifesting
a
strong
dislike
to
rearing
their
own
offspring
in
other
respects
they
are
quite
hardy
little
dogs
and
one
great
advantage
they
seldom
have
distemper
cold
and
damp
they
particularly
dislike
especially
when
puppies
and
the
greatest
care
should
be
taken
to
keep
them
thoroughly
dry
and
warm
when
very
young
indeed
they
can
stand
and
are
the
better
for
an
extraordinary
amount
of
heat
the
french
bulldog
bouledogue
francais
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
french
bulldog
originated
in
england
and
is
an
offshoot
of
the
english
miniature
variety
bulldog
not
the
bulldog
one
sees
on
the
bench
but
of
the
and
short
underjawed
specimens
which
were
common
in
london
nottingham
birmingham
and
sheffield
in
the
early
there
was
at
that
time
a
constant
emigration
of
laceworkers
from
nottingham
to
the
coast
towns
of
normandy
where
lace
factories
were
springing
into
existence
and
these
immigrants
frequently
took
a
bulldog
with
them
to
the
land
of
their
adoption
the
converse
method
was
also
adopted
prior
to
french
bulldogs
were
imported
into
this
country
with
the
object
of
resuscitating
the
strain
of
bantam
bulldogs
which
in
course
of
years
had
been
allowed
to
dwindle
in
numbers
and
were
in
danger
of
becoming
extinct
there
are
superficial
similarities
between
the
english
and
the
french
toy
bulldog
the
one
distinguishing
characteristic
being
that
in
the
french
variety
the
ears
are
higher
on
the
head
and
are
held
erect
until
a
few
years
ago
the
two
were
interbred
but
disputes
as
to
their
essential
differences
led
the
kennel
club
to
intervene
and
the
types
have
since
been
kept
rigidly
apart
the
smart

of

chapter
iv
the
bernard
the
history
of
the
bernard
dog
would
not
be
complete
without
reference
being
made
to
the
noble
work
that
he
has
done
in
switzerland
his
native
land
how
the
hospice
bernard
kept
a
considerable
number
of
dogs
which
were
trained
to
go
over
the
mountains
with
small
barrels
round
their
necks
containing
restoratives
in
the
event
of
their
coming
across
any
poor
travellers
who
had
either
lost
their
way
or
had
been
overcome
by
the
cold
we
have
been
told
that
the
intelligent
animals
saved
many
lives
in
this
way
the
subjects
of
their
deliverance
often
being
found
entirely
buried
in
the
snow
handsome
as
the
bernard
is
with
his
attractive
colour
and
markings
he
is
a
dog
from
the
records
of
old
writers
it
is
to
be
gathered
that
to
refill
the
kennels
at
the
hospice
which
had
been
rendered
vacant
from
the
combined
catastrophes
of
distemper
and
the
fall
of
an
avalanche
which
had
swept
away
nearly
all
their
hounds
the
monks
were
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
a
cross
with
the
newfoundland
and
the
pyrenean
sheepdog
the
latter
not
unlike
the
bernard
in
size
and
appearance
then
again
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
at
some
time
the
bloodhound
has
been
introduced
and
it
is
known
for
a
certainty
that
almost
all
the
most
celebrated
bernards
in
england
at
the
present
time
are
closely
allied
to
the
mastiff
the
result
of
all
this
intermixture
of
different
breeds
has
been
the
production
of
an
exceedingly
fine
race
of
dogs
which
form
one
of
the
most
attractive
features
at
our
dog
shows
and
are
individually
excellent
guards
and
companions
as
a
companion
the
bernard
can
not
be
surpassed
when
a
large
dog
is
required
for
the
purpose
most
docile
in
temperament
and
disposition
he
is
admirably
suited
as
the
associate
of
a
lady
or
a
child
the
bernard
is
sensitive
to
a
degree
and
seldom
forgets
an
insult
which
he
resents
with
dignity
specimens
of
the
breed
have
occasionally
been
seen
that
are
savage
but
when
this
is
the
case
of
some
sort
has
assuredly
been
the
provoking
cause
the
dogs
at
the
hospice
of
bernard
are
small
in
comparison
with
those
that
are
seen
in
england
belonging
to
the
same
race
the
holy
fathers
were
more
particular
about
their
markings
than
great
size
the
body
colour
should
be
brindle
or
orange
tawny
with
white
markings
the
muzzle
white
with
a
line
running
up
between
the
eyes
and
over
the
skull
joining
at
the
back
the
white
collar
that
encircles
the
neck
down
to
the
front
of
the
shoulders
the
colour
round
the
eyes
and
on
the
ears
should
be
of
a
darker
shade
in
the
red
in
the
centre
of
the
white
line
at
the
occiput
there
should
be
a
spot
of
colour
these
markings
are
said
to
represent
the
stole
chasuble
and
scapular
which
form
part
of
the
vestments
worn
by
the
monks
but
it
is
seldom
that
the
markings
are
so
clearly
defined
they
are
more
often
white
with
brindle
or
orange
patches
on
the
body
with
heads
in
england
bernards
are
either
distinctly
rough
in
coat
or
smooth
but
the
generality
of
the
hospice
dogs
are
broken
in
coat
having
a
texture
between
the
two
extremes
the
properties
however
of
the
rough
and
smooth
are
the
same
so
that
the
two
varieties
are
often
bred
together
and
as
a
rule
both
textures
of
coat
will
be
the
result
of
the
alliance
the
late
schumacher
a
great
authority
on
the
breed
in
switzerland
averred
that
dogs
with
very
rough
coats
were
found
to
be
of
no
use
for
work
on
the
alps
as
their
thick
covering
became
so
loaded
with
snow
and
their
feet
so
clogged
that
they
succumbed
under
the
weight
and
perished
on
that
account
they
were
discarded
by
the
monks
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
the
bernard
schumacher
wrote
in
a
letter
to
macdona
who
was
the
first
to
introduce
the
breed
into
great
britain
in
any
numbers
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
holy
fathers
of
the
great
saint
bernard
their
race
descends
from
the
crossing
of
a
bitch
a
bulldog
species
of
denmark
and
a
mastiff
shepherd
dog
of
the
pyrenees
the
descendants
of
the
crossing
who
have
inherited
from
the
danish
dog
its
extraordinary
size
and
bodily
strength
and
from
the
pyrenean
mastiff
the
intelligence
the
exquisite
sense
of
smell
and
at
the
same
time
the
faithfulness
and
sagacity
which
characterise
them
have
acquired
in
the
space
of
five
centuries
so
glorious
a
notoriety
throughout
europe
that
they
well
merit
the
name
of
a
distinct
race
for
themselves
from
the
same
authority
we
learn
that
it
is
something
like
six
hundred
years
since
the
bernard
came
into
existence
it
was
not
however
till
competitive
exhibitions
for
dogs
had
been
for
some
years
established
that
the
bernard
gained
a
footing
in
great
britain
a
few
specimens
had
been
imported
from
the
hospice
before
cumming
macdona
then
the
rev
cumming
macdona
introduced
us
to
the
celebrated
tell
who
with
others
of
the
breed
brought
from
switzerland
formed
the
foundation
of
his
magnificent
kennel
at
west
kirby
in
cheshire
albert
smith
whom
some
few
that
are
now
alive
will
remember
as
an
amusing
lecturer
brought
a
pair
from
the
hospice
when
returning
from
a
visit
to
the
continent
and
made
them
take
a
part
in
his
attractive
entertainment
but
the
associations
of
the
bernard
with
the
noble
deeds
recorded
in
history
were
not
then
so
widely
known
and
these
two
dogs
passed
away
without
having
created
any
particular
enthusiasm
later
on
at
a
dog
show
at
cremorne
held
in
two
bernards
were
exhibited
each
of
whom
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
monk
and
were
respectively
the
property
of
the
rev
bate
and
stone
these
dogs
were
exhibited
without
pedigrees
but
were
said
to
have
been
bred
at
the
hospice
of
bernard
three
years
later
at
the
national
show
at
birmingham
a
separate
class
was
provided
for
the
saintly
breed
and
cumming
macdona
was
first
and
second
with
tell
and
bernard
this
led
to
an
immediate
popularity
of
the
bernard
but
tell
was
the
hero
of
the
shows
at
which
he
appeared
and
his
owner
was
recognised
as
being
the
introducer
into
this
country
of
the
magnificent
variety
of
the
canine
race
that
now
holds
such
a
prominent
position
as
a
show
dog
the
names
of
tell
and
bernard
have
been
handed
down
to
fame
the
former
as
the
progenitor
of
a
long
line
of
offspring
the
latter
as
one
of
the
founders
of
the
famous
shefford
kennel
kept
by
fred
gresham
who
probably
contributed
more
to
the
perfecting
of
the
bernard
than
any
other
breeder
his
birnie
monk
abbess
grosvenor
hector
and
shah
are
names
which
appear
in
the
pedigrees
of
most
of
the
best
dogs
of
more
recent
times
when
gresham
drew
his
long
record
of
success
to
a
close
there
came
a
lull
in
the
popularity
of
the
breed
until
inman
in
partnership
with
walmsley
established
a
kennel
first
at
barford
near
bath
and
then
at
the
priory
at
bowden
in
cheshire
where
they
succeeded
in
breeding
the
finest
kennel
of
bernards
that
has
ever
been
seen
in
the
world
inman
had
for
several
years
owned
good
dogs
and
set
about
the
work
on
scientific
principles
he
in
conjunction
with
walmsley
purchased
the
kenilworth
from
loft
bred
that
dog
produce
with
a
brindle
mastiff
of
high
repute
and
then
crossed
back
to
his
bernards
with
the
most
successful
results
inman
was
instrumental
in
forming
the
national
bernard
club
which
was
soon
well
supported
with
members
and
now
has
at
its
disposal
a
good
collection
of
valuable
challenge
cups
the
dogs
bred
at
bowden
carried
all
before
them
in
the
show
ring
and
were
continually
in
request
for
stud
purposes
improving
the
breed
to
a
remarkable
extent
at
the
disposal
of
inman
and
walmsley
kennel
there
were
such
admirable
dogs
as
the
wolfram
from
whom
were
bred
tannhauser
narcissus
leontes
and
klingsor
the
dogs
the
king
son
and
the
viking
the
bitch
judith
inman
and
the
smooth
viola
the
the
finest
specimen
of
her
sex
that
has
probably
ever
been
seen
these
dogs
and
bitches
with
several
others
were
dispersed
all
over
england
with
the
exception
of
klingsor
who
went
to
south
africa
almost
all
the
best
bernards
in
great
britain
at
the
present

have
been
bred
or
are

no
breed
of
dogs
has
greater
claim
to
the
title
of
friend
of
man
and
it
has
become
famous
for
its
known
readiness
and
ability
to
save
persons
in
danger
especially
from
drowning
it
is
strong
and
courageous
in
the
water
and
on
land
a
properly
trained
newfoundland
is
an
ideal
companion
and
guard
innumerable
are
the
accounts
of
newfoundlands
having
proved
their
devotion
to
their
owners
and
of
the
many
lives
saved
by
them
in
river
and
sea
and
when
sir
edwin
landseer
selected
one
of
the
breed
as
the
subject
of
his
picture
entitled
a
distinguished
member
of
the
humane
society
he
was
justified
not
only
by
the
sentiment
attaching
to
this
remarkable
race
of
dogs
but
also
by
the
deeds
by
which
newfoundlands
have
made
good
their
claim
to
such
great
distinction
and
the
popular
recognition
of
this
no
doubt
in
some
degree
added
to
the
great
esteem
in
which
this
painting
has
always
been
held
the
picture
was
painted
in
and
as
almost
everyone
knows
represents
a
white
and
black
newfoundland
the
dog
portrayed
was
typical
of
the
breed
and
after
a
lapse
of
over
seventy
years
the
painting
has
now
the
added
value
of
enabling
us
to
make
a
comparison
with
specimens
of
the
breed
as
it
exists
such
a
comparison
will
show
that
among
the
best
dogs
now
living
are
some
which
might
have
been
the
model
for
this
picture
it
is
true
that
in
the
interval
the
white
and
black
newfoundlands
have
been
coarser
heavier
higher
on
the
legs
with
an
expression
denoting
excitability
quite
foreign
to
the
true
breed
but
these
departures
from
newfoundland
character
are
passing
away
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
good
the
breed
is
rapidly
returning
to
the
type
which
landseer
picture
represents
a
dog
of
great
beauty
dignity
and
benevolence
of
character
showing
in
its
eyes
an
almost
human
pathos
some
to
thirty
years
ago
there
was
considerable
discussion
among
owners
of
newfoundlands
in
this
country
as
to
the
proper
colour
of
the
true
breed
and
there
were
many
persons
who
claimed
as
some
still
claim
that
the
black
variety
is
the
only
true
variety
and
that
the
white
and
black
colouring
indicates
a
again
landseer
picture
is
of
value
because
in
the
first
place
we
may
be
almost
certain
that
he
would
have
selected
for
such
a
picture
a
typical
dog
of
the
breed
and
secondly
because
the
picture
shows
nearly
half
a
century
prior
to
the
discussion
a
white
and
black
dog
typical
in
nearly
every
respect
except
colour
of
the
black
newfoundland
there
is
no
appearance
of
in
dog
on
the
contrary
he
reveals
all
the
characteristics
of
a
thoroughbred
seventy
years
ago
therefore
the
white
and
black
variety
may
be
fairly
considered
to
have
been
established
and
it
is
worthy
of
mention
here
that
idstone
quoted
an
article
written
in
stating
that
back
in
the
eighteenth
century
newfoundlands
were
large
liver
and
white
dogs
it
is
clear
also
that
in
newfoundlands
in
british
north
america
were
of
various
colours
additional
evidence
too
is
provided
in
the
fact
that
when
selecting
the
type
of
head
for
their
postage
stamp
the
government
of
newfoundland
chose
the
landseer
dog
therefore
there
are
very
strong
arguments
against
the
claim
that
the
true
variety
is
essentially
black
however
that
may
be
there
are
now
two
established
varieties
the
black
and
the
white
and
black
there
are
also
dogs
but
they
are
rare
and
are
not
favoured
it
is
stated
however
that
puppies
of
that
colour
are
generally
the
most
promising
in
all
other
respects
the
black
variety
of
the
newfoundland
is
essentially
black
in
colour
but
this
does
not
mean
that
there
may
be
no
other
colour
for
most
black
newfoundlands
have
some
white
marks
and
these
are
not
considered
objectionable
so
long
as
they
are
limited
to
white
hairs
on
the
chest
toes
or
the
tip
of
the
tail
in
fact
a
white
marking
on
the
chest
is
said
to
be
typical
of
the
true
breed
any
white
on
the
head
or
body
would
place
the
dog
in
the
other
than
black
variety
the
black
colour
should
preferably
be
of
a
dull
jet
appearance
which
approximates
to
brown
in
the
other
than
black
class
there
may
be
black
and
tan
bronze
and
white
and
black
the
latter
predominates
and
in
this
colour
beauty
of
marking
is
very
important
the
head
should
be
black
with
a
white
muzzle
and
blaze
and
the
body
and
legs
should
be
white
with
large
patches
of
black
on
the
saddle
and
quarters
with
possibly
other
small
black
spots
on
the
body
and
legs
apart
from
colour
the
varieties
should
conform
to
the
same
standard
the
head
should
be
broad
and
massive
but
in
no
sense
heavy
in
appearance
the
muzzle
should
be
short
square
and
clean
cut
eyes
rather
wide
apart
deep
set
dark
and
small
not
showing
any
haw
ears
small
with
close
side
carriage
covered
with
fine
short
hair
there
should
be
no
fringe
to
the
ears
expression
full
of
intelligence
dignity
and
kindness
the
body
should
be
long
square
and
massive
loins
strong
and
well
filled
chest
deep
and
broad
legs
quite
straight
somewhat
short
in
proportion
to
the
length
of
the
body
and
powerful
with
round
bone
well
covered
with
muscle
feet
large
round
and
close
the
tail
should
be
only
long
enough
to
reach
just
below
the
hocks
free
from
kink
and
never
curled
over
the
back
the
quality
of
the
coat
is
very
important
the
coat
should
be
very
dense
with
plenty
of
undercoat
the
outer
coat
somewhat
harsh
and
quite
straight
a
curly
coat
is
very
objectionable
a
dog
with
a
good
coat
may
be
in
the
water
for
a
considerable
time
without
getting
wet
on
the
skin
the
appearance
generally
should
indicate
a
dog
of
great
strength
and
very
active
for
his
build
and
size
moving
freely
with
the
body
swung
loosely
between
the
legs
which
gives
a
slight
roll
in
gait
this
has
been
compared
to
a
sailor
roll
and
is
typical
of
the
breed
as
regards
size
the
newfoundland
club
standard
gives
lbs
to
lbs
weight
for
a
dog
and
lbs
to
lbs
for
a
bitch
with
an
average
height
at
the
shoulder
of
inches
and
inches
respectively
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
dogs
in
proper
condition
do
conform
to
both
requirements
at
any
rate
the
writer
is
unable
to
trace
any
prominent
newfoundlands
which
do
and
it
would
be
safe
to
assume
that
for
dogs
of
the
weights
specified
the
height
should
be
quite
inches
for
dogs
and
inches
for
bitches
a
dog
weighing
lbs
and
measuring
inches
in
height
at
the
shoulder
would
necessarily
be
long
in
body
to
be
in
proportion
and
would
probably
much
nearer
approach
the
ideal
form
of
a
newfoundland
than
a
taller
dog
in
that
respect
newfoundlands
have
very
much
improved
during
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
years
ago
the
most
noted
dogs
were
stated
as
a
rule
to
be
well
over
inches
in
height
but
their
weight
for
height
would
indicate
legginess
which
is
an
abomination
in
a
newfoundland
a
newfoundland
is
quite
tall
enough
and
even
that
height
should
not
be
gained
at
the
expense
of
type
and
symmetry
the
white
and
black
variety
are
as
a
rule
slightly
taller
smaller
in
loin
and
longer
in
head
but
these
differences
in
the
two
varieties
are
being
rapidly
removed
and
at
no
distant
date
the
white
and
black
variety
will
probably
be
as
correct
in
type
and
symmetry
as
the
black
variety
now
is
for
very
many
years
the
black
variety
has
been
the
better
in
type
and
in
breeding
if
blacks
are
desired
it
will
be
safer
as
a
general
rule
to
insist
upon
the
absence
of
white
and
black
blood
in
any
of
the
immediate
ancestors
of
the
sire
and
dam
but
if
on
the
contrary
white
and
black
dogs
are
required
the
proper
course
is
to
make
judicious
crosses
between
the
black
and
white
and
black
varieties
and
destroy
any
black
puppies
unless
they
are
required
for
further
crosses
with
white
and
black
blood
in
any
case
the
first
cross
is
likely
to
produce
both
black
and
white
and
black
puppies
but
the
latter
if
bred
back
to
the
white
and
black
blood
would
generally
produce
white
and
black
newfoundlands
in
mating
never
be
guided
solely
by
the
good
points
of
the
dog
and
bitch
it
is
very
desirable
that
they
should
both
have
good
points
the
more
good
ones
the
better
but
it
is
more
important
to
ensure
that
they
are
dissimilar
in
their
defects
and
if
possible
that
in
neither
case
is
there
a
very
objectionable
defect
especially
if
such
defect
was
also
apparent
in
the
animal
sire
or
dam
illustration
vale
nicolas
newfoundland
ch
shelton
viking
photograph
by
fall
it
is
therefore
important
to
study
what
were
the
good
and
still
more
so
the
bad
points
in
the
parents
and
grandparents
if
you
do
not
know
these
other
newfoundland
breeders
will
willingly
give
information
and
any
trouble
involved
in
tracing
the
knowledge
required
will
be
amply
repaid
in
the
results
and
probably
save
great
disappointment
when
rearing
puppies
give
them
soft
food
such
as
rice
and
milk
as
soon
as
they
will
lap
and
shortly
afterwards
scraped
lean
meat
newfoundland
puppies
require
plenty
of
meat
to
induce
proper
growth
the
puppies
should
increase
in
weight
at
the
rate
of
lbs
a
week
and
this
necessitates
plenty
of
flesh
bone
and
food
plenty
of
meat
both
raw
and
cooked
milk
is
also
good
but
it
requires
to
be
strengthened
with
plasmon
or
casein
the
secret
of
growing
dogs
with
plenty
of
bone
and
substance
is
to
get
a
good
start
from
birth
good
feeding
warm
dry
quarters
and
freedom
for
the
puppies
to
move
about
and
exercise
themselves
as
they
wish
forced
exercise
may
make
them
go
wrong
on
their
legs
medicine
should
not
be
required
except
for
worms
and
the
puppies
should
be
physicked
for
these
soon
after
they
are
weaned
and
again
when
three
or
four
months
old
or
before
that
if
they
are
not
thriving
if
free
from
worms
newfoundland
puppies
will
be
found
quite
hardy
and
under
proper
conditions
of
food
and
quarters
they
are
easy
to
rear
chapter
vi
the
great
dane
the
origin
of
the
great
dane
like
that
of
many
other
varieties
of
dogs
is
so
obscure
that
all
researches
have
only
resulted
in
speculative
theories
but
the
undoubted
antiquity
of
this
dog
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
representatives
of
a
breed
sufficiently
similar
to
be
considered
his
ancestors
are
found
on
some
of
the
oldest
egyptian
monuments
a
few
years
ago
a
controversy
arose
on
the
breed
proper
designation
when
the
germans
claimed
for
it
the
title
deutsche
dogge
germany
had
several
varieties
of
big
dogs
such
as
the
hatzrude
saufanger
ulmer
dogge
and
rottweiler
metzgerhund
but
contemporaneously
with
these
there
existed
as
in
other
countries
in
europe
another
very
big
breed
but
much
nobler
and
more
thoroughbred
known
as
the
great
dane
when
after
the
war
of
national
feeling
was
pulsating
very
strongly
in
the
veins
of
reunited
germany
the
german
cynologists
were
on
the
lookout
for
a
national
dog
and
for
that
purpose
the
great
dane
was
deutsche
dogge
and
elected
as
the
champion
of
german
dogdom
for
a
long
time
all
these
breeds
had
no
doubt
been
indiscriminately
crossed
the
great
dane
was
introduced
into
this
country
spasmodically
some
years
ago
when
he
was
commonly
referred
to
as
the
boarhound
or
the
german
mastiff
and
for
a
time
the
breed
had
to
undergo
a
probationary
period
in
the
foreign
class
at
dog
shows
but
it
soon
gained
in
public
favour
and
in
the
early
a
great
dane
club
was
formed
and
the
breed
has
since
become
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
larger
dogs
the
kennel
club
has
classed
the
great
dane
amongst
the
dogs
probably
because
with
us
he
can
not
find
a
quarry
worthy
of
his
mettle
but
for
all
that
he
has
the
instincts
and
qualifications
of
a
sporting
dog
and
he
has
proved
himself
particularly
valuable
for
hunting
big
game
in
hot
climates
which
he
stands
very
well
respecting
the
temperament
of
the
great
dane
and
his
suitability
as
a
companion
writers
have
gone
to
extremes
in
praise
and
condemnation
in
his
favour
it
must
be
said
that
in
natural
intelligence
he
is
surpassed
by
very
few
other
dogs
he
has
a
most
imposing
figure
and
does
not
like
some
other
big
breeds
slobber
from
his
mouth
which
is
a
particularly
unpleasant
peculiarity
when
a
dog
is
kept
in
the
house
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
admitted
that
with
almost
the
strength
of
a
tiger
he
combines
the
excitability
of
a
terrier
and
no
doubt
a
badly
trained
great
dane
is
a
very
dangerous
animal
it
is
not
sufficient
to
teach
him
in
the
haphazard
way
which
might
be
successful
in
getting
a
small
dog
under
control
but
even
as
a
companion
he
ought
to
be
trained
systematically
and
considering
his
marked
intelligence
this
is
not
difficult
of
accomplishment
the
great
dane
attains
his
full
development
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
to
two
years
and
considering
that
puppies
have
to
build
up
in
that
time
a
very
big
skeleton
and
straight
limbs
special
attention
must
be
given
to
the
rearing
of
them
the
dam
whelps
frequently
eight
puppies
and
sometimes
even
a
few
more
larke
princess
thor
had
a
litter
of
seventeen
but
even
eight
is
too
great
a
number
for
a
bitch
to
suckle
in
a
breed
where
great
size
is
a
desideratum
not
more
than
four
or
at
the
outside
five
should
be
left
with
the
bitch
the
others
should
be
put
to
a
foster
mother
or
if
they
are
weaklings
or
it
is
best
to
destroy
them
after
the
puppies
are
weaned
their
food
should
be
of
quality
and
they
require
ample
space
for
exercise
and
play
nothing
is
worse
than
to
take
the
youngsters
for
forced
marches
before
their
bones
have
become
firm
before
giving
the
description
and
standard
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
great
dane
clubs
a
few
remarks
on
some
of
the
leading
points
will
be
useful
the
general
characteristic
of
the
great
dane
is
a
combination
of
grace
and
power
and
therefore
the
lightness
of
the
greyhound
as
well
as
the
heaviness
of
the
mastiff
must
be
avoided
the
head
should
be
powerful
but
at
the
same
time
show
quality
by
its
nice
modelling
the
eyes
should
be
intelligent
and
vivacious
but
not
have
the
hard
expression
of
the
terrier
the
distance
between
the
eyes
is
of
great
importance
if
too
wide
apart
they
give
the
dog
a
stupid
appearance
and
if
too
close
he
has
a
treacherous
look
another
very
important
point
is
the
graceful
carriage
of
the
tail
when
it
is
curled
over
the
back
it
makes
an
otherwise
handsome
dog
look
mean
and
a
tail
that
curls
at
the
end
like
a
corkscrew
is
also
very
ugly
in
former
times
faking
was
not
infrequently
resorted
to
to
correct
a
faulty
tail
carriage
but
it
is
easily
detected
great
danes
sometimes
injure
the
end
of
the
tail
by
hitting
it
against
a
hard
substance
and
those
with
a
good
carriage
of
tail
are
most
liable
to
this
because
in
excitement
they
slash
it
about
whereas
the
faulty
position
of
the
tail
curled
over
the
back
insures
immunity
from
harm
until
recently
british
great
dane
breeders
and
exhibitors
have
paid
very
little
attention
to
colour
on
the
principle
that
like
a
good
horse
a
good
great
dane
can
not
be
a
bad
colour
the
english
clubs
however
have
now
in
this
particular
also
adopted
the
german
standard
the
orthodox
colours
are
brindle
fawn
blue
black
and
harlequin
in
the
brindle
dogs
the
ground
colour
should
be
any
shade
from
light
yellow
to
dark
on
which
the
brindle
appears
in
darker
stripes
the
harlequins
have
on
a
pure
white
ground
fairly
large
black
patches
which
must
be
of
irregular
shape
broken
up
as
if
they
had
been
torn
and
not
have
rounded
outlines
when
brindle
great
danes
are
continuously
bred
together
it
has
been
found
that
they
get
darker
and
that
the
peculiar
striping
disappears
and
in
that
case
the
introduction
of
a
good
fawn
into
the
strain
is
advisable
the
constant
mating
of
harlequins
has
the
tendency
to
make
the
black
patches
disappear
and
the
union
with
a
good
black
great
dane
will
prevent
the
loss
of
colour
the
following
is
the
official
description
issued
by
the
great
dane
club
general
appearance
the
great
dane
is
not
so
heavy
or
massive
as
the
mastiff
nor
should
he
too
nearly
approach
the
greyhound
type
remarkable
in
size
and
very
muscular
strongly
though
elegantly
built
the
head
and
neck
should
be
carried
high
and
the
tail
in
line
with
the
back
or
slightly
upwards
but
not
curled
over
the
elegance
of
outline
and
grace
of
form
are
most
essential
to
a
dane
size
is
absolutely
necessary
but
there
must
be
that
alertness
of
expression
and
briskness
of
movement
without
which
the
dane
character
is
lost
he
should
have
a
look
of
dash
and
daring
of
being
ready
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
temperament
the
great
dane
is
affectionate
and
faithful
to
his
master
not
demonstrative
with
strangers
intelligent
courageous
and
always
alert
his
value
as
a
guard
is
unrivalled
he
is
easily
controlled
when
well
trained
but
he
may
grow
savage
if
confined

preferred
provided
that

head
taken
altogether
the
head
should
give
the
idea
of
great
length
and
strength
of
jaw
the
muzzle
or
foreface
is
broad
and
the
skull
proportionately
narrow
so
that
the
whole

when
viewed
from

has
the
appearance
of

the

varies
with
the
height
of
the
dog
ins
from
the
tip
of
the
nose
to

a
good
measurement
for
a
dog
of
ins
at
the
shoulder
the
length
from
the
end
of
the
nose
to
the
point
between
the
eyes
should
be
about
equal
or
preferably
of
greater
length
than

should
be
flat
rather
than
domed
and
have
a
slight
indentation
running
up
the
centre
the

not
prominent
there
should
be
a
decided
rise

no
abrupt

this
is
quite
a
characteristic
of
the

chapter
vii
the
dalmatian
before
the
kennel
club
found
it
necessary
to
insist
upon
a
precise
definition
of
each
breed
the
dalmatian
was
known
as
the
coach
dog
a
name
appropriately
derived
from
his
fondness
for
following
a
carriage
for
living
in
and
about
the
stable
and
for
accompanying
his
master
horses
at
exercise
as
an
adjunct
to
the
carriage
he
is
peculiarly
suitable
for
in
fine
weather
he
will
follow
between
the
wheels
for
long
distances
without
showing
fatigue
keeping
easy
pace
with
the
best
horses
he
appears
almost
to
prefer
equine
to
human
companionship
and
he
is
as
fond
of
being
among
horses
as
the
collie
is
of
being
in
the
midst
of
sheep
yet
he
is
of
friendly
disposition
and
it
must
be
insisted
that
he
is
by
no
means
so
destitute
of
intelligence
as
he
is
often
represented
to
be
on
the
contrary
he
is
capable
of
being
trained
into
remarkable
cleverness
as
circus
proprietors
have
discovered
the
earliest
authorities
agree
that
this
breed
was
first
introduced
from
dalmatia
and
that
he
was
brought
into
this
country
purely
on
account
of
his
sporting
proclivities
of
late
years
however
these
dogs
have
so
far
degenerated
as
to
be
looked
upon
simply
as
companions
or
as
exhibition
dogs
for
only
very
occasionally
can
it
be
found
that
any
pains
have
been
taken
to
train
them
systematically
for
the
first
of
the
variety
which
appeared
in
the
show
ring
was
james
fawdry
captain
in
at
that
period
they
were
looked
upon
as
a
novelty
and
though
the
generosity
and
influence
of
a
few
admirers
ensured
separate
classes
being
provided
for
the
breed
at
the
leading
shows
it
did
not
necessitate
the
production
of
such
perfect
specimens
as
those
which
a
few
years
afterwards
won
prizes
at
the
first
they
were
more
popular
in
the
north
of
england
than
in
any
other
part
of
great
britain
it
was
at
kirkby
lonsdale
that
james
spotted
dick
was
bred
and
an
early
exploiter
of
the
breed
who
made
his
dogs
famous
was
newby
wilson
of
lakeside
windermere
he
was
indebted
to
hugo
droesse
of
london
for
the
foundation
of
his
stud
inasmuch
as
it
was
from
droesse
that
he
purchased
ch
acrobat
and
ch
berolina
at
a
later
date
the
famed
coming
still
and
prince
iv
were
secured
from
the
same
kennel
the
latter
dog
being
the
progenitor
of
most
of
the
best
specimens
that
have
attained
notoriety
as
down
to
the
present
day
in
appearance
the
dalmatian
should
be
very
similar
to
a
pointer
except
in
head
and
marking
still
though
not
so
long
in
muzzle
nor
so
pendulous
in
lip
as
a
pointer
there
should
be
no
coarseness
or
common
look
about
the
skull
a
fault
which
is
much
too
prevalent
then
again
some
judges
do
not
attach
sufficient
importance
to
the
eyelids
or
rather
sears
which
should
invariably
be
edged
round
with
black
or
brown
those
which
are
in
this
particular
should
be
discarded
however
good
they
may
be
in
other
respects
the
density
and
pureness
of
colour
in
both
blacks
and
browns
is
of
great
importance
but
should
not
be
permitted
to
outweigh
the
evenness
of
the
distribution
of
spots
on
the
body
no
black
patches
or
even
mingling
of
the
spots
should
meet
with
favour
any
more
than
a
or
a
dog
should
command
attention
the
variety
usually
prevails
in
a
cross
between
the
two
colours
the
offspring
very
seldom
having
the
markings
the
uninitiated
may
be
informed
that
dalmatian
puppies
are
always
born
pure
white
the
clearer
and
whiter
they
are
the
better
they
are
likely
to
be
there
should
not
be
the
shadow
of
a
mark
or
spot
on
them
when
about
a
fortnight
old
however
they
generally
develop
a
dark
ridge
on
the
belly
and
the
spots
will
then
begin
to
show
themselves
first
about
the
neck
and
ears
and
afterwards
along
the
back
until
at
about
the
sixteenth
day
the
markings
are
distinct
over
the
body
excepting
only
the
tail
which
frequently
remains
white
for
a
few
weeks
longer
the
standard
of
points
as
laid
down
by
the
leading
club
is
sufficiently
explicit
to
be
easily
understood
and
is
as
follows
general
appearance
the
dalmatian
should
represent
a

is
certainly
the
most
agile
second
to
this
type
in
favour
is
the
variety
a
very
hard
useful
dog
well
adapted
for
hill
work
and
usually
very
fleet
of
foot
he
is
not
so
sweet
in
temper
as
the
black
and
white
and
is
slow
to
make
friends
in
the
ettrick
and
yarrow
district
the
smooth
is
a
popular
sheepdog
the
shepherds
maintain
that
he
climbs
the
hills
more
swiftly
than
the
rough
and
in
the
heavy
snowstorms
his
clean
unfeathered
legs
do
not
collect
and
carry
the
snow
he
has
a
fuller
coat
than
the
show
specimens
usually
carry
but
he
has
the
same
type
of
head
eye
and
ears
only
not
so
well
developed
then
there
is
the
scottish
bearded
or
highland
collie
less
popular
still
with
the
a
dog
in
outward
style
but
soft
in
temperament
and
many
of
them
make
better
cattle
than
sheep
dogs
this
dog
and
the
old
english
sheepdog
are
much
alike
in
appearance
but
that
the
bearded
is
a
more
racy
animal
with
a
head
resembling
that
of
the
dandie
dinmont
rather
than
the
square
head
of
the
bobtail
the
bearded
collie
is
capable
of
getting
through
a
good
day
work
but
is
not
so
steady
nor
so
wise
as
the
black
and
white
or
even
the
smooth
coated
variety
he
is
a
favourite
with
the
butcher
and
drover
who
have
sometimes
a
herd
of
troublesome
cattle
to
handle
and
he
is
well
suited
to
rough
and
rocky
ground
active
in
movement
and
as
as
the
wild
goat
he
can
endure
cold
and
wet
without
discomfort
and
can
live
on
the
highland
hills
when
others
less
sturdy
would
succumb
in
the
standard
adopted
for
judging
the
breed
many
points
are
given
for
good
legs
and
feet
bone
body
and
coat
while
head
and
ears
are
not
of
great
importance
movement
size
and
general
appearance
have
much
weight
the
colour
is
varied
in
this
breed
specimens
are
not
uncommon
and
snow
white
with
orange
or
black
markings
may
often
be
seen
but
the
popular
colour
is
grizzly
grey
unfortunately
the
coats
of
many
are
far
too
soft
and
the
undercoat
is
frequently
absent
working
trials
to
test
the
skill
of
the
sheepdog
have
become
frequent
fixtures
among
shepherds
and
farmers
within
recent
years
and
these
competitions
have
done
much
towards
the
improvement
of
the
working
qualities
of
the
collie
in
general
the
excelling
competitors
at
working
trials
are
the
black
and
white
collies
the
variety
and
the
beardie
are
less
frequent
winners
the
handsome
and
distinguished
gentlemen
of
the
ch
wishaw
leader
type
are
seldom
seen
on
the
trial
field
although
formerly
such
a
dog
as
ch
ormskirk
charlie
might
be
successfully
entered
with
others
equally
well
bred
from
the
kennels
of
that
good
trainer
and
fancier
piggin
of
long
eaton
a
good
working
collie
however
is
not
always
robed
in
elegance
what
is
desirable
is
that
the
shepherd
and
farmer
should
fix
a
standard
of
points
and
breed
as
near
as
possible
to
that
standard
as
the
keepers
of
the
show
collie
breed
to
an
acknowledged
type
of
perfection
nevertheless
from
a
bad
worker
of
good
descent
many
an
efficient
worker
might
be
produced
by
proper
mating
and
those
of
us
skilled
in
the
breeding
of
collies
know
the
importance
of
a
process
of
selection
from
unsullied
strains
it
is
a
pity
that
the
dog
of
the
shepherd
does
not
receive
the
attention
in
the
way
of
feeding
and
grooming
that
is
bestowed
on
the
ornamental
show
dog
he
is
too
often
neglected
in
these
particulars
notwithstanding
this
neglect
however
the
average
life
of
the
working
dog
is
longer
by
a
year
or
two
than
that
of
his
more
beautiful
cousin
pampering
and
artificial
living
are
not
to
be
encouraged
but
on
the
other
hand
neglect
has
the
same
effect
of
shortening
the
span
of
life
and
bad
feeding
and
inattention
to
cleanliness
provoke
the
skin
diseases
which
are
far
too
prevalent
there
is
not
a
more
graceful
and
physically
beautiful
dog
to
be
seen
than
the
show
collie
of
the
present
period
produced
from
the
old
working
type
he
is
now
practically
a
distinct
breed
his
qualities
in
the
field
are
not
often
tested
but
he
is
a
much
more
handsome
and
attractive
animal
and
his
comeliness
will
always
win
for
him
many
admiring
friends
the
improvements
in
his
style
and
appearance
have
been
alleged
to
be
due
to
an
admixture
with
gordon
setter
blood
in
the
early
years
of
exhibitions
he
showed
the
shorter
head
heavy
ears
and
much
of
the
black
and
tan
colouring
which
might
seem
to
justify
such
a
supposition
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
cross
was
ever
purposely
sought
gradually
the
colour
was
lightened
to
sable
and
a
mingling
of
black
white
and
tan
came
into
favour
the
shape
of
the
head
was
also
improved
these
improvements
in
beauty
of
form
and
colour
have
been
largely
induced
by
the
many
collie
clubs
now
in
existence
not
only
in
the
united
kingdom
and
america
but
also
in
south
africa
and
germany
by
whom
the
standards
of
points
have
been
perfected
type

been
enhanced
the

the
small
ornamental

that
now
prevail

more
classical
and
scientific

careful

of

achieved
what
may
be
considered
the
superlative
degree
of
quality
without
appreciable

twenty
years
or
so
ago
when

were
becoming
fashionable
the

was
in

was
paid

no

has
had
a
longer
or
more
brilliant
career
than

although
he
was
not
esteemed
as
a
successful
sire
yet
he
was
certainly
the
greatest
favourite
among
our

quite
as
certainly
as
his
more
amply
attired
relative
originally
he
was
a
dog
produced
by
mating
the
black

with
the
greyhound
but
the
greyhound
type
which
was
formerly
very
marked
can
scarcely
be
discerned

it

not

that

is
discovered
in

producing
perhaps
a
a

chapter

the
old
english
sheepdog
intelligent
and
picturesque
workmanlike
and
affectionate
the
old
english
sheepdog
combines
in
his
shaggy
person
the
attributes
at
once
of
a
drover
drudge
and
of
an
ideal
companion
although
the
modern
dog
is
seen
less
often
than
of
old
performing
his
legitimate
duties
as
a
shepherd
dog
there
is
no
ground
whatever
for
supposing
that
he
is
a
whit
less
sagacious
than
the
mongrels
which
have
largely
supplanted
him
the
instincts
of
the
race
remain
unchanged
but
the
mongrel
certainly
comes
cheaper
carefully
handled
in
his
youth
the
is
unequalled
as
a
stock
dog
and
he
is
equally
at
home
and
efficient
in
charge
of
sheep
of
cattle
and
of
new
forest
ponies
so
is
the
natural
herding
instinct
of
the
breed
that
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
the
modern
shepherd
so
frequently
puts
up
with
an
inferior
animal
in
place
of
the
genuine
article
nor
is
it
as
a
shepherd
dog
alone
that
the
shines
in
the
field
his
qualifications
as
a
sporting
dog
are
excellent
and
he
makes
a
capital
retriever
being
usually
under
excellent
control
generally
and
taking
very
readily
to
water
his
natural
inclination
to
remain
at
his
master
heel
and
his
exceptional
sagacity
and
quickness
of
perception
will
speedily
develop
him
in
a
sportsman
hands
into
a
dog
to
shoot
over
these
points
in
his
favour
should
never
be
lost
sight
of
because
his
increasing
popularity
on
the
show
bench
is
apt
to
mislead
many
of
his
admirers
into
the
belief
that
he
is
an
ornamental
rather
than
a
utility
dog
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact
nevertheless
he
has
few
equals
as
a
house
dog
being
naturally
cleanly
in
his
habits
affectionate
in
his
disposition
an
admirable
watch
and
an
extraordinarily
adaptable
companion
as
to
his
origin
there
is
considerable
conflict
of
opinion
owing
to
the
natural
difficulty
of
tracing
him
back
to
that
period
when
the
as
he
flourishes
was
all
unknown
and
the
voluminous
records
of
a
watchful
kennel
club
were
still
undreamed
of
from
time
immemorial
a
sheepdog
of
one
kind
or
another
has
presided
over
the
welfare
of
flocks
and
herds
in
every
land
probably
in
an
age
less
peaceable
than
ours
this
canine
guardian
was
called
upon
in
addition
to
his
other
duties
to
protect
his
charges
from
wolves
and
bears
and
other
marauders
in
that
case
it
is
very
possible
that
the
early
progenitors
of
the
breed
were
built
upon
a
larger
and
more
massive
scale
than
is
the
sheepdog
of
the
herd
dogs
of
foreign
countries
such
as
the
calabrian
of
the
pyrenees
the
himalayan
drover
dog
and
the
russian
owtchah
are
all
of
them
massive
and
powerful
animals
far
larger
and
fiercer
than
our
own
though
each
of
them
and
notably
the
owtchah
has
many
points
in
common
with
the
english
it
is
quite
possible
that
all
of
them
may
trace
their
origin
at
some
remote
period
to
the
same
ancestral
strain
indeed
it
is
quite
open
to
argument
that
the
founders
of
our
breed
as
it
exists
were
imported
into
england
at
some
date
when
the
duties
of
a
sheepdog
demanded
of
him
fighting
qualities
no
longer
necessary
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
one
finds
conclusive
evidence
that
the
breed
was
very
fairly
represented
in
many
parts
of
england
notably
in
suffolk
hampshire
and
dorsetshire
and
also
in
wales
youatt
writes
of
it
in
richardson
in
and
stonehenge
in
their
descriptions
vary
a
little
though
the
leading
characteristics
are
much
the
same
but
each
writer
specially
notes
the
exceptional
sagacity
of
the
breed
the
dog
was
well
known
in
scotland
too
under
the
title
of
the
bearded
collie
for
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
last
is
merely
a
variant
of
the
breed
he
differs
in
point
of
fact
chiefly
by
reason
of
possessing
a
tail
the
amputation
of
which
is
a
recognised
custom
in
england
with
regard
to
this
custom
it
is
said
that
the
drovers
originated
it
their
dogs
kept
for
working
purposes
were
immune
from
taxation
and
they
adopted
this
method
of
distinguishing
the
animals
thus
exempted
it
has
been
argued
by
disciples
of
the
darwinian
theory
of
inherited
effects
from
continued
mutilations
that
a
long
process
of
breeding
from
tailless
animals
has
resulted
in
producing
puppies
naturally
and
it
is
difficult
on
any
other
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
fact
that
many
puppies
are
so
born
it
is
certainly
a
fact
that
one
or
two
natural
are
frequently
found
in
a
litter
of
which
the
remainder
are
duly
furnished
with
tails
from
careful
consideration
of
the
weight
of
evidence
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
breed
was
originally
a
tailless
one
but
the
modern
custom
undoubtedly
accentuates
its
picturesqueness
by
bringing
into
special
prominence
the
rounded
shaggy
quarters
and
the
characteristic
gait
which
distinguish
the
old
english
sheepdog
somewhere
about
the
there
would
appear
to
have
been
a
revival
of
interest
in
the
welfare
and
attempts
were
made
to
bring
him
into
prominence
in
his
admirers
succeeded
in
obtaining
for
him
a
separate
classification
at
a
recognised
show
and
at
the
curzon
hall
at
birmingham
in
that
year
three
temerarious
competitors
appeared
to
undergo
the
ordeal
of
expert
judgment
it
was
an
unpromising
beginning
for
wynn
who
officiated
found
their
quality
so
inferior
that
he
contented
himself
with
awarding
a
second
prize
but
from
this
small
beginning
important
results
were
to
spring
and
the
old
english
sheepdog
has
made
great
strides
in
popularity
since
then
at
clerkenwell
in
the
entries
in
his
classes
reached
a
total
of
over
one
hundred
and
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
quality
this
satisfactory
result
is
due
in
no
small
measure
to
the
initiative
of
the
old
english
sheepdog
club
a
society
founded
in

the
avowed
intention

alone
turning
to
the
questions
of

and
kennel
management
we
may
start
with
the
puppy
it
is
obvious
that
where
bone
and
substance
are
matters
of
special
desirability
it
is
essential
to
build
up
in
the
infant
what
is
to
be
expected
of
the
adult
for
this
reason
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
allow
the
dam
to
bring
up
too
many
by
herself
to
about
six
or
seven
she
can
do
justice
but
a
healthy
bitch
not
infrequently
gives
birth
to
a
dozen
or
more
under
such
circumstances
the
services
of
a
are
a
cheap
investment
by
dividing
the
litter
the
weaklings
may
be
given
a
fair
chance
in
the
struggle
for
existence
otherwise
they
receive
scant
consideration
from
their
stronger
brethren
at
three
or
four
days
old
the
tails
should
be
removed
as
near
the
rump
as
possible
the
operation
is
easy
to
perform
and
if
done
with
a
sharp
clean
instrument
there
is
no
danger
of
after
ill
effects
if
the
mother
be
kept
on
a
very
liberal
diet
it
will
usually
be
found
that
she
will
do
all
that
is
necessary
for
her
family
welfare
for
the
first
three
weeks
by
which
time
the
pups
have
increased
prodigiously
in
size
they
are
then
old
enough
to
learn
to
lap
for
themselves
an
accomplishment
which
they
very
speedily
acquire
beginning
with
fresh
cow
milk
for
a
week
their
diet
may
be
gradually
increased
to
mellin
or
benger
food
and
later
to
gruel
and
quaker
oats
their
steadily
increasing
appetites
being
catered
for
by
the
simple
exercise
of
commonsense
feed
them
little
and
often
about
five
times
a
day
and
encourage
them
to
move
about
as
much
as
possible
and
see
that
they
never
go
hungry
without
allowing
them
to
gorge
let
them
play
until
they
tire
and
sleep
until
they
hunger
again
and
they
will
be
found
to
thrive
and
grow
with
surprising
rapidity
at
six
weeks
old
they
can
fend
for
themselves
and
shortly
afterwards
additions
may
be
made
to
their
diet
in
the
shape
of
paunches
carefully
cleaned
and
cooked
and
spratt
puppy
rodnim
a
plentiful
supply
of
fresh
milk
is
still
essential
gradually
the
number
of
their
meals
may
be
decreased
first
to
four
a
day
and
later
on
to
three
until
at
six
months
old
they
verge
on
adolescence
and
may
be
placed
upon
the
rations
of
the
adult
dog
two
meals
a
day
meanwhile
the
more
fresh
air
and
sunshine
exercise
and
freedom
they
receive
the
better
will
they
prosper
but
care
must
be
taken
that
they
are
never
allowed
to
get
wet
their
especially
must
be
thoroughly
dry
well
ventilated
and
scrupulously
clean
as
to
the
adult
dog
his
needs
are
three
he
must
be
well
fed
well
housed
and
well
exercised
two
meals
a
day
suffice
him
but
he
likes
variety
and
the
more
his
fare
can
be
diversified
the
better
will
he
do
justice
to
it
biscuits

paunches
and
sheep
heads
with
an
occasional
big
bone
to
gnaw
provide
unlimited
change
and
the
particular
tastes
of
individuals
should
be
learned
and
catered
for
as
to
the
kennel
there
is
no
need
whatever
for
a
fancy
structure
any
weatherproof
building
will
do
provided
it
be
well
ventilated
and
free
from
draughts
in
very
cold
weather
a
bed
of
clean
wheat
straw
is
desirable
in
summer
the
bare
boards
are
best
in
all
weathers
cleanliness
is
an
absolute
essential
and
a
liberal
supply
of
fresh
water
should
be
always
available
grooming
is
an
important
detail
in
a
breed
whose
picturesqueness
depends
so
largely
on
the
profuseness
of
their
shaggy
coats
but
there
is
a
general
tendency
to
overdo
it
a
good
stiff
pair
of
dandy
brushes
give
the
best
results
but
the
coats
must
not
be
allowed
to
mat
or
tangle
which
they
have
a
tendency
to
do
if
not
properly
attended
to
mats
and
tangles
if
taken
in
time
can
generally
be
teased
out
with
the
fingers
and
it
is
the
greatest
mistake
to
try
and
drag
them
out
with
combs
these
last
should
be
used
as
little
as
possible
and
only
with
the
greatest
care
when
necessary
at
all
an
loses
half
his
natural
charm
far
preferable

a
muddy
matted
customer

chow
is
a
dog
of
great
versatility
he
is
a
born
sportsman
and
loves
an
life
a
warrior
always
ready
to
accept
battle
but
seldom
provoking
it
he
has
a
way
of
his
own
with
tramps
and
seldom
fails
to
induce
them
to
continue
their
travels
yet
withal
he
is
a
friend
of
children
an
ideal
companion
and
often
has
a
clever
gift
for
parlour
tricks
in

his
fatherland
he
is
esteemed
for
another
quality
his
excellence
as
a
substitute
for
roast
mutton
though
in
his
own
country
he
is
regarded
as
plebeian
just
a
common
cur
he
is
by
no
means
a
mongrel
that
he
is
of
ancient
lineage
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
always
breeds
true
to
type
he
yields
to
the
pekinese
spaniel
the
claim
to
be
the
royal

the
poodle
the
poodle
is
commonly
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
wisely
intelligent
of
all
members
of
the
canine
race
he
is
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
but
in
spite
of
his
claims
of
long
descent
and
his
extraordinary
natural
cleverness
he
has
never
been
widely
popular
in
this
country
as
the
collie
and
the
are
popular
there
is
a
general
belief
that
he
is
a
fop
whose
time
is
largely
occupied
in
personal
embellishment
and
that
he
requires
a
great
deal
of
individual
attention
in
the
matter
of
his
toilet
it
may
be
true
that
to
keep
him
in
exhibition
order
and
perfect
cleanliness
his
owner
has
need
to
devote
more
consideration
to
him
than
is
necessary
in
the
case
of
many
breeds
but
in
other
respects
he
gives
very
little
trouble
and
all
who
are
attached
to
him
are
consistent
in
their
opinion
that
there
is
no
dog
so
intensely
interesting
and
responsive
as
a
companion
his
qualities
of
mind
and
his
acute
powers
of
reasoning
are
indeed
so
great
that
there
is
something
almost
human
in
his
attractiveness
and
his
devotion
his
aptitude
in
learning
is
never
denied
and
many
are
the
stories
told
of
his
marvellous
talent
and
versatility
not
merely
as
a
showman
dog
has
he
distinguished
himself
he
is
something
more
than
a
mountebank
of
the
booths
trained
to
walk
the
tight
rope
and
stand
on
his
head
he
is
an
adept
at
performing
tricks
but
it
is
his
alertness
of
brain
that
places
him
apart
from
other
animals
there
is
the
example
of
the
famous
munito
who
in
perplexed
the
parisians
by
his
cleverness
with
playing
cards
and
his
intricate
arithmetical
calculations
paris
was
formerly
the
home
of
most
of
the
learned

the
instance
of

who
had
the
habit
of
dirtying
the
boots
of
the
in
order
that
his
master
a
stationed
across
the
bridge
might
enjoy
the
profit
of
cleaning
them
in
belgium
poodles
were
systematically
trained
to
smuggle
valuable
lace
which
was
wound
round
their
shaven
bodies
and
covered
with
a
false
skin
these
dogs
were
schooled
to
a
dislike
of
all
men
in
uniform
and
consequently
on
their
journey
between
mechlin
and
the
coast
they
always
gave
a
wide
berth
to
the
customs
officers
on
the
continent
poodles
of
the
larger
kind
are
often
used
for
draught
work
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
breed
originated
in
germany
where
it
is
known
as
the
and
classed
as
the
familiaris
in
form
and
coat
he
would
seem
to
be
closely
related
to
the
old
and
the
resemblance
between
a
brown
poodle
and
an
irish
water
spaniel
is
remarkable
the
poodle
is
no
longer
regarded
as
a
sporting
dog
but
at
one
period
he
was
trained
to
retrieve
waterfowl
and
he
still
on
occasion
displays
an
eager
fondness
for
the
water
throughout
europe
and
in
the
united
states
wherever
these
dogs
are
kept
it
is
usual
to
clip
the
coat
on
the
face
the
legs
and
the
hinder
part
of
the
body
leaving
tufts
of
hair
on
the
thighs
and
a
ring
of
hair
on
the
pasterns
the
origin
and
purpose
of
the
custom
are
not
apparent
but
now
that
poodles
are
almost
always
kept
as
house
dogs
this
mode
of
ornamentation
at
least
commends
itself
by
reducing
the
labour
of
daily
grooming
if
the
coat
is
to
be
maintained
in
good
condition
and
the
dog
to
be
a
pleasant
associate
the
profuse
and
long
coat
of
this
dog
has
the
peculiarity
that
if
not
kept
constantly
brushed
out
it
twists
up
into
little
cords
which
increase
in
length
as
the
new
hair
grows
and
clings
about
it
the
unshed
old
hair
and
the
new
growth
entwined
together
thus
become
distinct
cords
eventually
if
these
cords
are
not
cut
short
or
accidentally
torn
off
they
drag
along
the
ground
and
so
prevent
the
poor
animal
from
moving
with
any
degree
of
comfort
or
freedom
some
few
owners
who
admire
and
cultivate
these
long
cords
keep
them
tied
up
in
bundles
on
the
dog
back
but
so
unnatural
and
unsightly
a
method
of
burdening
the
animal
is
not
to
be
commended
corded
poodles
are
very
showy
and
from
the
remarkable
appearance
of
the
coat
attract
a
great
deal
of
public
attention
when
exhibited
at
shows
but
they
have
lost
popularity
among
most
fanciers
and
have
become
few
in
number
owing
to
the
obvious
fact
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
pets
of
them
or
keep
them
in
the
house
the
reason
of
this
is
that
the
coat
must
from
time
to
time
be
oiled
in
order
to
keep
the
cords
supple
and
prevent
them
from
snapping
and
of
course
as
their
coats
can
not
be
brushed
the
only
way
of
keeping
the
dog
clean
is
to
wash
him
which
with
a
corded
poodle
is
a
lengthy
and
laborious
process
further
the
coat
takes
hours
to
dry
and
unless
the
newly
washed
dog
be
kept
in
a
warm
room
he
is
very
liable
to
catch
cold
the
result
is
that
the
coats
of
corded
poodles
are
almost
invariably
dirty
and
somewhat
smelly
at
one
time
it
was
suggested
that
cordeds
and
were
two
distinct
breeds
but
it
is
now
generally
accepted
that
the
coat
of
every
poodle
will
if
allowed
develop
cords
curly
poodles
on
the
other
hand
have
advanced
considerably
in
favour
their
coats
should
be
kept
regularly
brushed
and
combed
and
if
washed
occasionally
they
will
always
be
smart
and
clean
and
pleasant
companions
in
the
house
the
four
colours
usually
considered
correct
are
black
white
brown
and
blue
white
poodles
are
considered
the
most
intelligent
and
it
is
certain
that
professional
trainers
of
performing
dogs
prefer
the
white
variety
the
black
come
next
in
the
order
of
intelligence
and
easily
surpass
the
brown
and
blue
which
are
somewhat
lacking
in
true
poodle
character
no
strict
lines
are
drawn
as
regards
brown
and
all
shades
ranging
from
cream
to
dark
brown
are
classed
as
brown
robert
long
a
few
years
ago
startled
her
by
exhibiting
some
specimens
but
they
were
regarded
as
freaks
and
did
not
become
popular
the
points
to
be
looked
for
in
choosing
a
poodle
are
that
he
should
be
a
lively
active
dog
with
a
long
fine
head
a
dark
oval
eye
with
a
bright
alert
expression
short
in
the
back
not
leggy
but
by
no
means
low
on
the
ground
with
a
good
loin
carrying
his
tail
well
up
the
coat
should
be
profuse
all
one
colour
very
curly
and
rather
wiry
to
the
touch
if
you
buy
a
poodle
puppy
you
will
find
it
like
other
intelligent
and
active
youngsters
full
of
mischief
the
great
secret
in
training
him
is
first
to
gain
his
affection
with
firmness
kindness
and
perseverance
you
can
then
teach
him
almost
anything
the
most
lively
and
excitable
dogs
are
usually
the
easiest
to
train
it
is
advantageous
to
teach
your
dog
when
you
give
him
his
meal
of
biscuit
letting
him
have
the
food
piece
by
piece
as
a
reward
when
each
trick
is
duly
performed
never
attempt
to
teach
him
two
new
tricks
at
a
time
and
when
instructing
him
in
a
new
trick
let
him
always
go
through
his
old
ones
first
make
it
an
invariable
rule
never
to
be
beaten
by
him
if
as
frequently
is
the
case
with
your
dogs
he
declines
to
perform
a
trick
do
not
pass
it
over
or
allow
him
to
substitute
another
he
likes
better
but
when
you
see
he
obstinately
refuses
punish
him
by
putting
away
the
coveted
food
for
an
hour
or
two
if
he
once
sees
he
can
tire
you
out
you
will
have
no
further
authority
over
him
while
if
you
are
firm
he
will
not
hold
out
against
you
long
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
make
a
dog
repeat
too
frequently
a
trick
which
he
obviously
dislikes
and
insistence
on
your
part
may
do
great
harm
the
poodle
is
exceptionally
sensitive
and
is
far
more
efficiently
taught
when
treated
as
a
sensible
being
rather
than
as
a
mere
quadrupedal
automaton
he
will
learn
twice
as
quickly
if
his
master
can
make
him
understand
the
reason
for
performing
a
task
the
whip
is
of
little
use
when
a
lesson
is
to
be
taught
as
the
dog
will
probably
associate
his
tasks
with
a
thrashing
and
go
through
them
in
that
unwilling
cowed
fashion
which
too
often
betrays
the
unthinking
hastiness
of
the
master
and
is
the
chief
reason
why
the
poodle
has
sometimes
been
regarded
as
a
spiritless
coward
the
poodle
bitch
makes
a
good
mother
rarely
giving
trouble
in
whelping
and
the
puppies
are
not
difficult
to
rear
their
chief
dangers
are
gastritis
and
congestion
of
the
lungs
which
can
be
avoided
with
careful
treatment
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
dense
coat
of
the
poodle
takes
a
long
time
to
dry
after
being
wetted
and
that
if
the
dog
has
been
out
in
the
rain
and
got
his
coat
soaked
or
if
he
has
been
washed
or
allowed
to
jump
into
a
pond
you
must
take
care
not
to
leave
him
in
a
cold
place
or
to
lie
inactive
before
he
is
perfectly
dry
most
poodles
are
kept
in
the
house
or
in
enclosed
kennels
well
protected
from
draught
and
moisture
and
there
is
no
difficulty
in
so
keeping
them
as
they
are
naturally
obedient
and
easily
taught
to
be
clean
in
the
house
and
to
be
regular
in
their
habits
the
coat
of
a
curly
poodle
should
be
kept
fleecy
and
free
from
tangle
by
being
periodically
combed
and
brushed
the
grooming
keeps
the
skin
clean
and
healthy
and
frequent
washing
even
for
a
white
dog
is
not
necessary
the
dog
will
of
course
require
clipping
from
time
to
time
in
paris
at
present
it
is
the
fashion
to
clip
the
greater
part
of
the
body
and
but
the
english
poodle
club
recommends
that
the
coat
be
left
on
as
far
down
the
body
as
the
last
rib
and
it
is
also
customary
with
us
to
leave
a
good
deal
of
coat
on
the
probably
the
poodle
of
his
day

this
country

black
corded
dog

to

a
dog
very
well

with
a
beautifully
moulded
head

dark
expressive

i
believe
was
only
once
beaten
in
the

he
died
some
few
years
ago
at
a
ripe
old
age
but
a
great
many
of
the
poodles
of
the
present
day
claim
relationship
to
him
one
of
his
most
famous
descendants
was

also
black

was
very
successful
at

another
very
handsome

was

again
a

to

haulgrave
since
the
curly
poodles
have
very
much
improved
and
the
best

of
the
breed
are
now
to
be
found
in
their
ranks

is
no

white

chapter

the
schipperke
the
schipperke
may
fitly
be
described
as
the
paul
pry
of
canine
society
his
insatiate
inquisitiveness
induces
him
to
poke
his
nose
into
everything
every
strange
object
excites
his
curiosity
and
he
will
if
possible
look
behind
it
the
slightest
noise
arouses
his
attention
and
he
wants
to
investigate
its
cause
there
is
no
end
to
his
liveliness
but
he
moves
about
with
almost
catlike
agility
without
upsetting
any
objects
in
a
room
and
when
he
hops
he
has
a
curious
way
of
catching
up
his
hind
legs
the
schipperke
disposition
is
most
affectionate
tinged
with
a
good
deal
of
jealousy
and
even
when
made
one
of
the
household
he
generally
attaches
himself
more
particularly
to
one
person
whom
he
owns
and
whose
protection
he
deems
his
special
duty
these
qualities
endear
the
schipperke
as
a
canine
companion
with
a
quaint
and
lovable
character
and
he
is
also
a
capital
vermin
dog
when
properly
entered
he
can
not
be
surpassed
as
a
ratter
schipperkes
have
always
been
kept
as
on
the
flemish
canal
barges
and
that
no
doubt
is
the
origin
of
the
name
which
is
the
flemish
for
little
skipper
the
syllable
ke
forming
the
diminutive
of
schipper
the
respectable
antiquity
of
this
dog
is
proved
by
the
result
of
the
researches
van
der
snickt
and
van
buggenhoudt
made
in
the
archives
of
flemish
towns
which
contain
records
of
the
breed
going
back
in
pure
type
over
a
hundred
years
the
first
schipperke
which
appeared
at
a
show
in
this
country
was
berrie
flo
this
was
however
such
a
mediocre
specimen
that
it
did
not
appeal
to
the
taste
of
the
english
public
in
seelig
brought
over
skip
drieske
and

the
was
purchased
by

and

two
others
by
krehl
later
on
joachim
became
the
owner
of
green
shtoots
and
bought
fritz
of
spa
in
belgium
and
these
dogs
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
two
kennels
which
laid
the
foundation
of
the
breed
in
england
it
was
probably
the
introduction
of
the
schipperke
to
england
that
induced
belgian
owners
to
pay
greater
attention
to
careful
breeding
and
a
club
was
started
in
in
brussels
whose
members
after
long
and
earnest
consideration
settled
a
description
and
standard
of
points
for
the
breed
not
long
afterwards
the
schipperke
club
england
was
inaugurated
and
drew
up
the
following

which
was
adopted
in

and
not
have
much
bone
the
bone
of
a
terrier
is
only
met
with
in
coarse
schipperkes
as
to
size
it
need
only
be
noted
that
the
maximum
of
the
small
size
is
that
generally
preferred
in
england
as
well
as
in
belgium
further
it
is
only
necessary
to
remark
that
the
schipperke
is
a
dog
of
quality
of
distinct
characteristics
cobby
in
appearance
not
long
in
the
back
nor
high
on
the
leg
the
muzzle
must
not
be
weak
and
thin
nor
short
and
blunt
and
finally
he
is
not
a
black
terrier
the
schipperke
tail
or
rather
its
absence
has
been
the
cause
of
much
discussion
and
at
one
time
gave
rise
to
considerable
acrimonious
feeling
amongst
fanciers
on
the
introduction
of
this
dog
into
great
britain
it
arrived
from
abroad
with
the
reputation
of
being
a
tailless
breed
but
whether
belgian
owners
accidentally
conveyed
that
impression
or
did
it
purposely
to
give
the
breed
an
additional
distinction
is
difficult
to
say
anyhow
the
schipperke
is
no
more
tailless
than
the
old
english
sheepdog
that
is
to
say
a
larger
number
of
individuals
are
born
without
any
caudal
appendage
or
only
a
stump
of
a
tail
than
in
any
other
variety
of
dogs
it
is
said
that
a
docked
dog
can
be
told
from
one
that
has
been
born
tailless
in
this
way
when
the
docked
animal
is
pleased
a
slight
movement
at
the
end
of
the
spine
where
the
tail
was
cut
off

discernible

tailless

the
bloodhound
the
bloodhound
was
much
used
in
olden
times
in
hunting
and
in
the
pursuit
of
fugitives
two
services
for
which
his
remarkable
acuteness
of
smell
his
ability
to
keep
to
the
particular
scent
on
which
he
is
first
laid
and
the
intelligence
and
pertinacity
with
which
he
follows
up
the
trail
admirably
fit
him
the
use
and
employment
of
these
dogs
date
back
into
remote
antiquity
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
strabo
that
they
were
used
against
the
gauls
and
we
have
certain
knowledge
that
they
were
employed
not
only
in
the
frequent
feuds
of
the
scottish
clans
and
in
the
continuous
border
forays
of
those
days
but
also
during
the
hostilities
between
england
and
scotland
indeed
the
very
name
of
the
dog
calls
up
visions
of
feudal
castles
with
their
trains
of
knights
and
warriors
and
all
the
stirring
panorama
of
these
brave
days
of
old
when
the
only
tenure
of
life
property
or
goods
was
by
the
strong
hand
this
feudal
dog
is
frequently
pictured
by
the
poet
in
his
ballads
and
romances
and
in
the
lady
of
the
lake
we
find
the
breed
again
mentioned
as
dogs
of
black
hubert
breed
unmatched
for
courage
breath
and
speed
these
famous
black
bloodhounds
called
huberts
are
supposed
to
have
been
brought
by
pilgrims
from
the
holy
land
another

also
known
by
the

name

half
a

the

was
so
little
esteemed
in
this

that
the
breed
was
confined
to
the
kennels
of
a
very
few
owners
but
the
institution
of
dog
shows
induced
these
owners
to
bring
their
hounds
into
public
exhibition
when
it
was
seen
that
like

the
bloodhound
claimed
the

chapter
xiv
the
otterhound
the
otterhound
is
a
descendant
of
the
old
southern
hound
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
all
hounds
hunting
their
quarry
by
nose
had
a
similar
source
why
the
breed
was
first
called
the
southern
hound
or
when
his
use
became
practical
in
great
britain
must
be
subjects
of
conjecture
but
that
there
was
a
hound
good
enough
to
hold
a
line
for
many
hours
is
accredited
in
history
that
goes
very
far
back
into
past
centuries
the
hound
required
three
centuries
ago
even
was
all
the
better
esteemed
for
being
slow
and
unswerving
on
a
line
of
scent
and
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
up
to
within
half
that
period
the
southern
hound
had
been
especially
employed
in
devonshire
and
wales
the
last
sign
of
him
in
his
purity
was
perhaps
when
captain
hopwood
hunted
a
small
pack
of
hounds
very
similar
in
character
on
the
fitch
or
the
being
to
find
the
foraging
grounds
of
the
animal
and
then
on
a
line
that
might
be
two
days
old
hunt
him
to
his
lair
often
enough
ten
or
twelve
miles
off
when
this
sort
of
hunting
disappeared
and
improved
ideas
of
came
into
vogue
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
southern
hound
to
do
but
to
hunt
the
otter
he
may
have
done
this
before
at
various
periods
but
history
rather
tends
to
show
that
was
originally
associated
with
a
mixed
pack
and
some
of
sir
walter
scott
pages
seem
to
indicate
that
the
dandie
dinmont
and
kindred
scottish
terriers
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
sport
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
terrier
is
identical
with
the
now
recognised
otterhound
as
an
offshoot
of
the
southern
hound
but
be
that
as
it
may
there
has
been
a
special
breed
of
otterhound
for
the
last
eighty
years
very
carefully
bred
and
gradually
much
improved
in
point
of
appearance
they
are
beautiful
hounds
with
heads
as
typical
as
those
of
bloodhounds
legs
and
feet
that
would
do
for
foxhounds
a
unique
coat
of
their
own
and
they
are
exactly
suitable
for
hunting
the
otter

everyone
knows
who
has
had
the
enjoyment
of

hard

they
did

and

been

in
the
hands
of
carrick
who
was
famous
both
for
the
sport
he
showed
and
for
his
breed
of
otterhound
so
well
represented
at
all
the
important
shows
such
hounds
as
lottery
and
lucifer
were
very
typical
specimens
but
of
late
years
the
entries
of
otterhounds
have
not
been
very
numerous
at
the
great
exhibitions
and
this
can
well
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
are
wanted
in
greater
numbers
for
active
service
there
being
many
more
packs
than
formerly
in
all
for
the
united
kingdom
the
sport
of
is
decidedly
increasing
as
there
have
been
several
hunts
started
within
the
last
six
years
there
can
well
be
many
more
as
according
to
the
opinion
of
that
excellent
authority
the
late
rev
otter
davies
as
he
was
always
called
there
are
otters
on
every
river
but
owing
to
the
nocturnal
and
mysterious
habits
of
the
animals
their
whereabouts
or
existence
is
seldom
known
or
even
suspected
hunting
them
is
a
very
beautiful
sport
and
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
the
pure
otterhounds
should
not
be
more
generally
used
than
they
are
at
present
it
is
often
asserted
that
their
continued
exposure
to
water
has
caused
a
good
deal
of
rheumatism
in
the
breed
that
they
show
age
sooner
than
others
and
that
the
puppies
are
difficult
to
rear
there
are
however
many
advantages
in
having
a
pure
breed
and
there
is
much
to
say
for
the
perfect
work
of
the
otterhound
the
scent
of
the
otter
is
possibly
the
sweetest
of
all
trails
left
by
animals
one
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
an
animal
swimming
two
or
three
feet
from
the
bottom
of
a
and
the
same
from
the
surface
should
leave
a
clean
line
of
burning
scent
that
may
remain
for
twelve
or
eighteen
hours
the
supposition
must
be
that
the
scent
from
the
animal
at
first
descends
and
is
then
always
rising
at
any
rate
the
oldest
foxhound
or
harrier
that
has
never
touched
otter
is
at
once
in
ravishing
excitement
on
it
and
all
dogs
will
hunt
it
the
terrier
is
never
keener
than
when
he
hits
on
such
a
line
the
foxhound
so
wonderful
in
his
forward
dash
may
have
too
much
of
it
for
otter
hunting
the
otter
is
so
wary
his
holt
can
very
well
be
passed
his
delicious
scent
may
be
overrun
but
the
otterhound
is
equal
to
all
occasions
he
is
terribly
certain
on
the
trail
when
he
finds
it
nothing
can
throw
him
off
it
and
when
his
deep
note
swells
into
a
sort
of
savage
howl
as
he
lifts
his
head
towards
the
roots
of
some
old
pollard
there
is
a
meaning
in
it
no
mistake
has
been
made
in
every
part
of
a
run
it
is
the
same
the
otter
dodges
up
stream
and
down
lands
for
a
moment
returns
to
his
holt
but
his
adversaries
are
always
with
him
and
as
one
sees
their
steady
work
the
impression
becomes
stronger
and
stronger
that
for
the
real
sport
of
there
is
nothing
as
good
as
the
otterhound
there
is
something
so
dignified
and
noble
about
the
hound
of
unsullied
strain
that
if
you
once
see
a
good
one
you
will
not
soon
forget
him
he
is
a
large
hound
as
he
well
needs
to
be
for
the

who
is
his
customary

for

powerful

inveterate

streams
and
consequently
to
be
mercilessly
slaughtered
although
always
in

fashion

be

such
prey

have

chapter
xv
the
irish
wolfhound
it
is
now
some
thirty
years
since
an
important
controversy
was
carried
on
in
the
columns
of
live
stock
on
the
nature
and
history
of
the
great
irish
wolfhound
the
chief
disputants
in
the
discussion
were
captain
graham
of
dursley
hickman
adcock
and
the
rev
wynn
and
the
main
point
as
issue
was
whether
the
dog
then
imperfectly
known
as
the
irish
wolfdog
was
a
true
descendant
of
the
ancient
graius
or
whether
it
was
a
mere
manufactured
mongrel
owing
its
origin
to
an
admixture
of
the
great
dane
and
the
dog
of
the
pyrenees
modified
and
brought
to
type
by
a
cross
with
the
highland
deerhound
it
was
not
doubted
indeed
history
and
tradition
clearly
attested
that
there
had
existed
in
early
times
in
ireland
a
very
large
and
rugged
hound
of
greyhound
form
whose
vocation
it
was
to
hunt
the
wolf
the
red
deer
and
the
fox
it
was
assuredly
known
to
the
romans
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
huge
dog
samr
which
jarl
gunnar
got
from
the
irish
king
myrkiarton
in
the
tenth
century
and
took
back
with
him
to
norway
was
one
of
this
breed
but
it
was
supposed
by
many
to
have
become
extinct
soon
after
the
disappearance
of
the
last
wolf
in
ireland
and
it
was
the
endeavour
of
captain
graham
to
demonstrate
that
specimens
although
admittedly
degenerate
were
still
to
be
found
and
that
they
were
capable
of
being
restored
to
a
semblance
of
the
original
type
at
the
time
when
he
entered
into
the
controversy
captain
graham
had
been
actively
interesting
himself
for
something
like
a
score
of
years
in
the
resuscitation
of
the
breed
and
his
patience
had
been
well
rewarded
by
the
year
the
irish
wolfhound
had
been
practically
restored
although
it
has
taken
close
upon
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
produce
the
magnificent
champions
cotswold
and
cotswold
patricia
those
brilliant
examples
of
the
modern
breed
a
brace
of
wolfhounds
who
bear
testimony
to
the
vast
amount
of
energy
and
perseverance
which
captain
graham
and
his
enthusiastic
colleague
major
garnier
displayed
in
evolving
from
rough
material
the
majestic
breed
that
holds
so
prominent
a
position
there
is
little
to
be
gathered
from
ancient
writings
concerning
the
size
and
appearance
of
the
irish
wolfhounds
in
early
times
exaggerated
figures
are
given
as
to
height
and
weight
but
all
authorities
agree
that
they
were
impressively
large
and
imposing
dogs
and
that
they
were
regarded
as
the
giants
of
the
canine
race
it
seems
extraordinary
that
so
little
should
have
been
accurately
known
and
recorded
of
a
dog
which
at
one
time
must
have
been
a
familiar
figure
in
the
halls
of
the
irish
kings
it
was
no
mere
mythical
animal
like
the
heraldic
griffin
but
an
actual
sporting
dog
which
was
accepted
as
a
national
emblem
of
the
emerald
isle
associated
with
the
harp
and
the
shamrock
as
regards
the
origin
of
the
irish
wolfhound
more
than
one
theory
is
advanced
by
some
authorities
it
is
suggested
that
it
was
the
dog
which
we
now
know
as
the
great
dane
others
hold
that
as
there
were
greyhounds
in
ireland
it
is
this
dog
under
another
name
which
is
now
accepted
but
probably
the
late
captain
graham
was
nearer
the
truth
when
he
gave
the
opinion
that
the
irish
hound
that
was
kept
to
hunt
wolves
has
never
become
extinct
at
all
but
is
now
represented
in
the
scottish
deerhound
only
altered
a
little
in
size
and
strength
to
suit
the
easier
work
required
of
it
that
of
hunting
the
deer
this
is
the
more
probable
as
the
fact
remains
that
the
chief
factor
in
the
resuscitation
of
the
irish
wolfhound
has
been
the
scottish
deerhound
the
result
of
captain
graham
investigations
when
seeking
for
animals
bearing
some
relationship
to
the
original
irish
wolfe
dogge
was
that
three
strains
were
to
be
found
in
ireland
but
none
of
the
representatives
at
that
time
was
anything
like
so
large
as
those
mentioned
in
early
writings
and
they
all
appeared
to
have
deteriorated
in
bone
and
substance
sir
j
power
of
kilfane
was
responsible
for
one
line
baker
of
ballytobin
for
another
and
mahoney
of
dromore
for
the
remaining
strain
from
bitches
obtained
from
two
of
these
kennels
captain
graham
by
crossing
them
with
the
great
dane
and
scottish
deerhound
achieved
the
first
step
towards
producing
the
animal
that
he
desired
later
on
the
russian
wolfhound
better
known
as
the
borzoi
an
exceedingly
large
hound
was
introduced
as
also
were
one
or
two
other
large
breeds
of
dogs
the
intermixture
of
these
canine
giants
however
was
not
at
first
very
satisfactory
as
although
plenty
of
bone
was
obtained
many
were
most
ungainly
in
appearance
and
animals
that
had
very
little
about
them
to
attract
attention
captain
graham
however
stuck
to
his
work
and
very
soon
the
specimens
that
he
brought
forward
began
to
show
a
fixity
of
type
both
in
head
and
in
general
outline
brian
was
one
of
his
best
dogs
but
he
was
not
very
large
as
he
only
stood
just
over
thirty
inches
at
the
shoulder
banshee
and
fintragh
were
others
but
probably
the
best
of
captain
graham
kennel
was
the
bitch
sheelah
it
was
not
however
until
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
that
the
most
perfect
dogs
were
bred

the
deerhound
the
deerhound
is
one
of
the
most
decorative
of
dogs
impressively
stately
and
picturesque
wherever
he
is
seen
whether
it
be
amid
the
surroundings
of
the
baronial
hall
reclining
at
luxurious
length
before
the
open
hearth
in
the
fitful
light
of
the
log
fire
that
flickers
on
polished
armour
and
tarnished
tapestry
out
in
the
open
straining
at
the
leash
as
he
scents
the
dewy
air
or
gracefully
bounding
over
the
purple
of
his
native
hills
grace
and
majesty
are
in
his
every
movement
and
attitude
and
even
to
the
most
prosaic
mind
there
is
about
him
the
inseparable
glamour
of
feudal
romance
and
poetry
he
is
at
his
best
alert
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
but
all
too
rare
now
is
the
inspiring
sight
that
once
was
common
among
the
mountains
of
morven
and
the
glens
of
argyll
of
the
hound
speeding
in
pursuit
of
his
antlered
prey
racing
him
at
full
stretch
along
the
mountain
ridge
or
baying
him
at
last
in
the
fastness
of
darksome
corrie
or
deep
ravine
gone
are
the
good
romantic
days
of
stalking
beloved
by
scrope
the
highlands
have
lost
their
loneliness
and
the
inventions
of
the
modern
gunsmith
have
robbed
one
of
the
grandest
of
hunting
dogs
of
his
glory
relegating
him
to
the
life
of
a
pedestrian
pet
whose
highest
dignity
is
the
winning
of
a
pecuniary
prize
under
kennel
club
rules
historians
of
the
deerhound
associate
him
with
the
original
irish
wolfdog
of
whom
he
is
obviously
a
close
relative
and
it
is
sure
that
when
the
wolf
still
lingered
in
the
land
it
was
the
frequent
quarry
of
the
highland
as
of
the
hibernian
hound
legend
has
it
that
prince
ossian
son
of
fingal
king
of
morven
hunted
the
wolf
with
the
grey
dogs
luath
and
bran
are
among
the
names
of
ossian
hounds
i
am
disposed
to
affirm
that
the
old
irish
wolfhound
and
the
highland
deerhound
are
not
only
intimately
allied
in
form
and
nature
but
that
they
are
two
strains
of
an
identical
breed
altered
only
in
size
by
circumstance
and
environment
whatever
the
source
of
the
highland
deerhound
and
at
whatever
period
it
became
distinct
from
its
now
larger
irish
relative
it
was
recognised
as
a
native
dog
in
scotland
in
very
early
times
and
it
was
distinguished
as
being
superior
in
strength
and
beauty
to
the
hounds
of
the
picts
from
remote
days
the
scottish
nobles
cherished
their
strains
of
deerhound
seeking
glorious
sport
in
the
highland
forests
the
red
deer
belonged
by
inexorable
law
to
the
kings
of
scotland
and
great
drives
which
often
lasted
for
several
days
were
made
to
round
up
the
herds
into
given
neighbourhoods
for
the
pleasure
of
the
court
as
in
the
reign
of
queen
mary
but
the
organised
coursing
of
deer
by
courtiers
ceased
during
the
stuart
troubles
and
was
left
in
the
hands
of
retainers
who
thus
replenished
their
chief
larder
the
revival
of
deerstalking
dates
back
hardly
further
than
a
hundred
years
it
reached
its
greatest
popularity
in
the
highlands
at
the
time
when
the
late
queen
and
prince
albert
were
in
residence
at
balmoral
solomon
hector
and
bran
were
among
the
balmoral
hounds
bran
was
an
especially
fine
animal
one
of
the
best
of
his
time
standing
over
thirty
inches
in
height
two
historic
feats
of
strength
and
endurance
illustrate
the
tenacity
of
the
deerhound
at
work
a
brace
of
dogs
named
percy
and
douglas
the
property
of
scrope
kept
a
stag
at
bay
from
saturday
night
to
monday
morning
and
the
pure
bred
bran
by
himself
pulled
down
two
unwounded
stags
one
carrying
ten
and
the
other
eleven
tines
these
of
course
are
record
performances
but
they
demonstrate
the
possibilities
of
the
deerhound
when
trained
to
his
natural
sport
illustration
armstrong
deerhound
ch
talisman
driving
was
commonly
resorted
to
in
the
extensive
forests
but
nowadays
when
forests
are
into
limited
shootings
the
deer
are
seldom
moved
from
their
home
preserves
whilst
with
the
use
of
improved
telescopes
and
the
rifle
stalking
has
gone
out
of
fashion
with
guns
having
a
muzzle
velocity
of
feet
per
second
it
is
no
longer
necessary
for
sportsmen
stealthily
to
stalk
their
game
to
come
within
easy
range
and
as
for
hounds
they
have
become
a
doubtful
appendage
to
the
chase
primarily
and
essentially
the
deerhound
belongs
to
the
order
hunting
by
sight
and
not
by
scent
and
although
he
may
indeed
occasionally
put
his
nose
to
the
ground
yet
his
powers
of
scent
are
not
remarkable
his
vocation
therefore
has
undergone
a
change
and
it
was
recently
ascertained
that
of
sixty
deer
forests
there
were
only
six
upon
which
deerhounds
were
kept
for
sporting
purposes
happily
the
deerhound
has
suffered
no
decline
in
the
favour
bestowed
upon
him
for
his
own
sake
the
contrary
is
rather
the
case
and
he
is
still
an
aristocrat
among
dogs
valued
for
his
good
looks
the
symmetry
of
his
form
his
grace
and
elegance
and
even
more
so
for
his
faithful
and
affectionate
nature
sir
walter
scott
declared
that
he
was
a
most
perfect
creature
of
heaven
and
when
one
sees
him
represented
in
so
beautiful
a
specimen
of
his
noble
race
as
ronan
rhyme
for
example
or
talisman
or
ayrshire
one
is
tempted
to
echo
this
high
praise
years
ago
captain
graham
drew
up
a
list
of
the
most
notable
dogs
of
the
last
century
among
these
were
sir
george

gruim
black
bran
the
marquis
of

donald
cameron
torrum
and
his
two
sons
monzie
and
young
torrum
and
dadley
hector
who
was
probably
the
dog
living
in
the
early
eighties
torrum
however
appears
to
have
been
the
most
successful
of
these
dogs
at
stud
he
was
an
exceedingly
grand
specimen
of
his
race
strong
framed
with
plenty
of
hair
of
a
blue
brindle
colour
captain
graham
own
dog
keildar
who
had
been
trained
for
deerstalking
in
windsor
park
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
deerhounds
ever
seen
his
full
height
was
inches
girth
inches
and
weight
his
colour
bluish
fawn
slightly
brindled
the
muzzle
and
ears
being
blue
his
nearest
competitor
for
perfection
was
after
hector
probably
mr
hood
wright
bevis
a
darkish
red
brown
brindle
of
about
inches
wright
was
the
breeder
of
champion
selwood
morven
who
was
the
celebrity
of
his
race
about
and
who
became
the
property
of
harry
rawson

stately
dog
was
a
dark
heather
brindle
standing
inches
at
the
shoulder
with
a
chest
girth
of
inches
a
few
years
ago
breeders
were
inclined
to
mar
the
beauty
of
the
deerhound
by
a
too
anxious
endeavour
to
obtain
great
size
rather
than
to
preserve
the
genuine
type
but
this
error
has
been
sufficiently
corrected
with
the
result
that
symmetry
and
elegance
conjoined
with
the
desired
attributes
of
speed
are
not
sacrificed
the
qualities
aimed
at
now
are
a
height
of
something
less
than
inches
and
a
weight
not
greater
than
with
straight
and
short
feet
a
deep
chest
with
broad
powerful
loins
slightly
arched
and
strength
of
with
stifles
and
the
hocks
well
let
down
straight
stifles
are
objectionable
giving
a
stilty
appearance
thick
shoulders
are
equally
a
blemish
to
be
avoided
as
also
a
too
great
heaviness
of
bone
the
following
is
the
accepted
standard
of
merit
head
the
head
should
be
broadest
at
the
ears
tapering
slightly
to
the
eyes
with
the
muzzle
tapering
more
decidedly
to
the
nose
the
muzzle
should
be
pointed
but
the
teeth
and
lips
level
the
head
should
be
long
the
skull
flat
rather
than
round
with
a
very
slight
rise
over
the
eyes
but
with
nothing
approaching
a
stop
the
skull
should
be
coated
with
moderately
long
hair
which
is
softer
than
the
rest
of
the
coat
the
nose
should
be
black
though
in
some
the
colour
is
blue
and
slightly
aquiline
in
the
dogs
a
black
muzzle
is
preferred
there
should
be
a
good
moustache
of
rather
silky
hair
and
a
fair
beard
ears
the
ears
should
be
set
on
high
and
in
repose
folded
back
like
the
greyhound
though
raised
above
the
head
in
excitement
without
losing
the
fold
and
even
in
some
cases
a
prick
ear
is
bad
a
big
thick
ear
hanging
flat
to
the
head
or
heavily
coated
with
long
hair
is
the
worst
of
faults
the
ear
should
be
soft
glossy
and
like
a
coat
to
the
touch
and
the
smaller
it
is
the
better
it
should
have
no
long
coat
or
long
fringe
but
there
is
often
a
silky
silvery
coat
on
the
body
of
the
ear
and
the
tip
whatever
the
general
colour
the
ears
should
be
black
or
neck
and
shoulders
the
neck
should
be
long
that
is
of
the
length
that
befits
the
greyhound
character
of
the
dog
an
neck
is
not
necessary
nor
desirable
for
the
dog
is
not
required
to
stoop
in
his
work
like
a
greyhound
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
mane
which
every
good
specimen
should
have
detracts
from
the
apparent
length
of
neck
moreover
a
deerhound
requires
a
very
strong
neck
to
hold
a
stag
the
nape
of
the
neck
should
be
very
prominent
where
the
head
is
set
on
and
the
throat
should
be
at
the
angle
and
prominent
the
shoulders
should
be
well
sloped
the
blades
well
back
with
not
too
much
width
between
them
loaded
and
straight
shoulders
are
very
bad
faults
stern
stern
should
be
tolerably
long
tapering
and
reaching
to
within
inches
of
the
ground
and
about
inches
below
the
hocks
when
the
dog
is
still
dropped
perfectly
straight
down
or
curved
when
in
motion
it
should
be
curved
when
excited
in
no
case
to
be
lifted
out
of
the
line
of
the
back
it
should
be
well
covered
with
hair
on
the
inside
thick
and
wiry
underside
longer
and
towards
the
end
a
slight
fringe
is
not
objectionable
a
curl
or
ring
tail
is
very
undesirable
eyes
the
eyes
should
be
dark
generally
they
are
dark
brown
or
hazel
a
very
light
eye
is
not
liked
the
eye
is
moderately
full
with
a
soft
look
in
repose
but
a
keen
gaze
when
the
dog
is
roused
the
rims
of
the
eyelids
should
be
black
body
the
body
and
general
formation
is
that
of
a
greyhound
of
larger
size
and
bone
chest
deep
rather
than
broad
but
not
too
narrow
and
the
loin
well
arched
and
drooping
to
the
tail
a
straight
back
is
not
desirable
this
formation
being
unsuitable
for
going
uphill
and
very
unsightly
legs
and
feet
the
legs
should
be
broad
and
flat
a
good
broad
forearm
and
elbow
being
desirable
of
course
as
straight
as
possible
feet
close
and
compact
with
toes
the
drooping
and
as
broad
and
powerful
as
possible
the
hips
being
set
wide
apart
the
should
be
well
bent
at
the
stifle
with
great
length
from
the
hip
to
the
hock
which
should
be
broad
and
flat
cow
hocks
weak
pasterns
straight
stifles
and
splay
feet
are
very
bad
faults
coat
the
hair
on

and
quarters
should
be
harsh
and
wiry
and
about
inches
or
inches
long

is
much
softer
there
should
be
a
slight
hairy
fringe
on
the
inside
of
the
fore
and
but
nothing
approaching
to
the
feathering
of
a
collie
the
deerhound
should
be
a
shaggy
dog
but
not
over
coated
a
woolly
coat
is
bad
some
good
strains
have
a
slight
mixture
of
silky
coat
with
the
hard
which
is
preferable
to
a
woolly
coat
but
the
proper
covering
is
a
thick
ragged
coat
harsh
or
crisp
to
the
touch
colour
colour
is
much
a
matter
of
fancy
but
there
is
no
manner
of
doubt
that
the
dark
is
the
most
preferred
next
come
the
darker
and
lighter
greys
or
brindles
the
darkest
being
generally
preferred
yellow
and
or
especially
with
black
points
ears

are
also
in
equal
estimation
this
being
the
colour
of
the
oldest
known

of

the

on

should
entirely
disqualify
in
other
cases
though
passable
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
get

huntsman
stations
the
hunters
at
separate
points
every
hundred
yards
or
so
round
the
wood
a
pack
of
hounds
is
sent
in
to
draw
the
quarry
and
on
the
wolves
breaking
cover
the
nearest
hunter
slips
his
dogs
these
endeavour
to
seize
their
prey
by
the
neck
where
they
hold
him
until
the
hunter
arrives
throws
himself
from
his
horse
and
with
his
knife
puts
an
end
to
the
fray
another
method
is
to
advance
across
the
open
country
at
intervals
of
about
two
hundred
yards
slipping
the
dogs
at
any
game
they
may
put
up
trials
are
also
held
in
russia
these
take
place
in
a
large
railed
enclosure
the
wolves
being
brought
in
carts
similar
to
our
deer
carts
in
this
case
a
brace
of
dogs
is
loosed
on
the
wolf
the
whole
merit
of
the
course
is
when
the
hounds
can
overtake
the
wolf
and
pin
him
to
the
ground
so
that
the
keepers
can
secure
him
alive
it
follows
therefore
that
in
this
case
also
the
hounds
must
be
of
equal
speed
so
that
they
reach
the
wolf
simultaneously
one
dog
would
of
course
be
unable
to
hold
him
naturally
the
dogs
have
to
be
trained
to
the
work
for
which
purpose
the
best
wolves
are
taken
alive
and
sent
to
the
kennels
where
the
young
dogs
are
taught
to
pin
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
can
not
turn
and
use
his
teeth
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
the
borzoi
should
not
be
used
for
coursing
in
this
country
one
of
the
first
examples
of
the
breed
exhibited
in
england
was
owned
by
hill
and
ashton
of
sheffield
about
at
which
time
good
specimens
were
imported
by
the
rev
macdona
and
lady
emily
peel
whose
sandringham
and
czar
excited
general
admiration
it
was
then
known
as
the
siberian
wolfhound
some
years
later
the
duchess
of
newcastle
obtained
several
fine
dogs
and
from
this
stock
her
grace
founded
the
kennel
which
has
since
become
so
famous
later
still
queen
alexandra
received
from
the
czar
a
gift
of
a
leash
of
these
stately
hounds
one
of
them
being
alex
who
quickly
achieved
honours
as
a
champion
the
breed
has
become
as
fashionable
in
the
united
states
as
in
great
britain
and
some
excellent
specimens
are
to
be
seen
at
the
annual
shows
at
madison
square
gardens
to
take
the
points
of
the
breed
in
detail
the
description
of
the
perfect
borzoi
is
as
follows
head
this
should
be
long
lean
and
well
balanced
and
the
length
from
the
tip
of
the
nose
to
the
eyes
must
be
the
same
as
from
the
eyes
to
the
occiput
a
dog
may
have
a
long
head
but
the
length
may
be
all
in
front
of
the
eyes
the
heads
of
this
breed
have
greatly
improved
the
last
few
years
fewer
specimens
and
more
of
the
desired
triangular
heads
being
seen
the
skull
should
be
flat
and
narrow
the
stop
not
perceptible
the
muzzle
long
and
tapering
too
much
stress
can
not
be
laid
on
the
importance
of
the
head
being
well
filled
up
before
the
eyes
the
head
from
forehead
to
nose
should
be
so
fine
that
the
direction
of
the
bones
and
principal
veins
can
be
seen
clearly
and
in
profile
should
appear
rather
roman
nosed
bitches
should
be
even
narrower
in
head
than
dogs
the
eyes
should
be
dark
expressive
almond
shaped
and
not
too
far
apart
the
ears
like
those
of
a
greyhound
small
thin
and
placed
well
back
on
the
head
with
the
tips
when
thrown
back
almost
touching
behind
the
occiput
it
is
not
a
fault
if
the
dog
can
raise
his
ears
erect
when
excited
or
looking
after
game
although
some
english
judges
dislike
this
frequent
characteristic
the
head
should
be
carried
somewhat
low
with
the
neck
continuing
the
line
of
the
back
shoulders
clean
and
sloping
well
back
the
shoulder
blades
should
almost
touch
one
another
chest
deep
and
somewhat
narrow
it
must
be
capacious
but
the
capacity
must
be
got
from
depth
and
not
from
barrel
ribs
a
bad
fault
in
a
running
hound
back
rather
bony
and
free
from
any
cavity
in
the
spinal
column
the
arch
in
the
back
being
more
marked
in
the
dog
than
in
the
bitch
loins
broad
and
very
powerful
showing
plenty
of
muscular
development
thighs
long
and
well
developed
with
good
second
thigh
the
muscle
in
the
borzoi
is
longer
than
in
the
greyhound
ribs
slightly
sprung
very
deep
reaching
to
the
elbow
lean
and
straight
seen
from
the
front
they
should
be
narrow
and
from
the
side
broad
at
the
shoulder
and
narrowing
gradually
down
to
the
foot
the
bone
appearing
flat
and
not
round
as
in
the
foxhound
the
least
thing
under
the
body
when
standing
still
not
straight
and
the
stifle
slightly
bent
they
should
of
course
be
straight
as
regards
each
other
and
not
but
straight
imply
a
want
of
speed
feet
like
those
of
the
deerhound
rather
long
the
toes
close
together
and
well
arched
coat
long
silky
not
woolly
either
flat
wavy
or
curly
on
the
head
ears
and
it
should
be
short
and
smooth
on
the
neck
the
frill
should
be
profuse
and
rather
curly
on
the
chest
and
the
rest
of
the
body
the
tail
and
it
should
be
long
the
being
well
feathered

the

description
embodies
the
standard
of
points
as
laid
down
and
adopted
by
the
borzoi
club
interpolated
with
some
remarks
for
the
further
guidance
of
the
novice
the
borzoi
club
was
founded
in
and
now
consists
of
about
fifty
members
with
the
duke
and
duchess
of
newcastle
as
it
does
much
good
work
for
the
breed
guaranteeing
classes
at
shows
where
otherwise
few
or
none
would
be
given
encouraging
the
breeding
of
borzois
by
offering
its
valuable
challenge
cups
and
other
special
prizes
and
generally
looking
after
the
interests
of
the
breed
although
the
club
standard
of
height
has
been
raised
from
and
inches
to
and
inches
for
dogs
and
bitches
respectively
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
best
dogs
of
far
exceed
these
measurements
and
unless
good
in
other
points
a
dog
of
inches
at
shoulder
would
stand
little
or
no
chance
in
the
showing
under
the
majority
of
english
judges
indeed
bitches
of
to
inches
are
by
no
means
uncommon
not
many
of
us
can
afford
to
start
at
the
top
of
the
tree
and
except
for
the
favoured
few
to
whom
money
is
no
object
and
who
can
buy
champions
there
is
no
better
way
of
starting
a
kennel
than
to
purchase
a
really
good
bitch
one
say
capable
of
winning
at
all
but
the
more
important
shows
she
must
be
of
good
pedigree
strong
and
healthy
such
an
one
ought
to
be
obtained
for
upwards
mate
her
to
the
best
dog
whose
blood
nicks
suitably
with
hers
but
do
not
waste
time
and
money
breeding
from
stud
dogs
for
if
you
do
it
is
certain
you
will
only
meet
with
disappointment
on
the
other
hand
if
you
have
had
little
or
no
experience
of
dogs
you
may
possibly
prefer
to
start
with
a
puppy
if
so
place
yourself
in
the
hands
of
a
breeder
with
a
reputation
at
stake
unless
you
have
a
friend
who
understands
the
breed
it
is
a
fact
that
even
a
cast
off
from
a
good
strain
that
has
been
bred
for
certain
points
for
years
is
more
likely
to
turn
out
a
better
dog
than
a
pup
whose
dam
has
been
mated
haphazard
to
some
dog
who
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
good
one
big
kennels
also
generally
possess
the
best
bitches
and
breed
from
them
and
the
bitch
is
quite
as
important
a
factor
as
the
sire
if
however
you
prefer
to
rely
on
your
own
judgment
and
wish
to
choose
a
puppy
yourself
from
a
litter
select
the
one
with
the
longest
head
biggest
bone
smallest
ears
and
longest
tail
or
as
many
of
these
qualities
as
you
can
find
combined
in
one
individual
coat
is
a
secondary
matter
in
quite
a
young
pup
here
one
should
be
guided
by
the
coat
of
the
sire
and
dam
still
choose
a
pup
with
a
heavy
coat
if
possible
although
when
this
puppy
coat
is
cast
the
dog
may
not
grow
so
good
as
one
as
some
of
the
litter
who
in
early
life
were
smoother
as
regards
size
a
borzoi
pup
of
three
months
should
measure
about
inches
at
the
shoulder
at
six
months
about
inches
and
at
nine
months
from
to
inches
after
ten
or
twelve
months
growth
is
very
slow
although
some
continue
adding
to
their
height
until
they
are
a
year
and
a
half
old
they
will
of
course
increase
in
girth
of
chest
and
develop
muscle
until
two
years
old
a
borzoi
may
be
considered
in
its
prime
at
from
three
to
four
years
of
age
as
regards
price
from
to
is
not
too
much
to
pay
for
a
really
good
pup
of
about
eight
to
ten
weeks
old
if
you
pay
less
you
will
probably
get
only
a
one
having
purchased
your
puppy
there
are
three
principal
items
to
be
considered
if
you
intend
to
rear
him
well
firstly
his
diet
must
be
varied
secondly
the
pup
must
have
unlimited
exercise
and
never
be
kept
on
the
chain
thirdly
internal
parasites
must
be
kept
in
check
for
young
puppies
ruby
worm
cure
is
most
efficacious
and
does
not
distress
the
patient
food
should
be
given
at
regular
intervals
not
less
frequently
than
five
times
a
day
to
newly
weaned
puppies
and
may
consist
of
porridge
bread
and
milk
raw
meat
minced
fine
and
any
table
scraps
with
plenty
of
new
milk
paunch
is
also
greatly
appreciated
and
being
easily
digested
may
be
given
freely
one
important
part
of
the
puppy
education
that
must
by
no
means
be
neglected
is
to
accustom
him
to
go
on
the
collar
and
lead
borzoi
pups
are
as
a
rule
extremely
nervous
and
it
requires
great
patience
in
some
cases
to
train
them
to
the
lead
short
lessons
should
be
given
when
about
four
months
old
if
you
can
induce
the
puppy
to
think
it
is
a
new
game
well
and
good
he
will
take
to
it
naturally
but
once
he
looks
upon
it
as
something
to
be
dreaded
it
means
hours
of
patient
work
to
break
him
in
if
you
decide
on
commencing
with
a
brood
bitch
see
that
she
is
dosed
for
worms
before
visiting
the
dog
that
she
is
in
good
hard
condition
not
fat
however
and
if
possible
accompany
her
yourself
and
see
her
mated
for
the
first
week
rather
less
than
her
usual
quantity
of
food
should
be
given
afterwards
feed
as
her
appetite
dictates
but
do
not
let
her
get
too
fat
or
she
may
have
a
bad
time
when
whelping
for
two
days
before
the
puppies
are
due
give
sloppy
but
nourishing
diet
and
this
should
be
continued
given
slightly
warm
for
four
or
five
days
after
the
pups
are
born
borzois
as
a
rule
make
excellent
mothers
but
to
rear
them
well
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
suckle
more
than
five
or
if
a
strong
big
bitch
six
pups
if
the
litter
is
larger
it
is
better
to
destroy
the
remainder
or
use
a
foster
mother

strawberry
king
whatever
they
may
be
in
their
native
land
and
the
first
imported
specimens
were
perhaps
rather
uncertain
in
temper
the
borzoi
as
we
know
him
in
this
country
is
affectionate
devoted
to
his
owner
friendly
with
his
kennel
companions
and
makes
a
capital
house
dog
as
a
lady
companion
he
is
hard
to
beat
indeed
a
glance
at
any
show
catalogue
will
prove
that
the
majority
of
borzois
are
owned
by
the
gentle
sex
no
one
need
be
deterred
from
keeping
a
borzoi
by
a
remark
the
writer
has
heard
hundreds
of
times
at
shows
those
dogs
are
delicate
this
is
not
the
case
once
over
distemper
troubles
and
the
breed
certainly
does
suffer
badly
if
it
contracts
the
disease
the
borzoi
is
as
hardy
as
most
breeds
if
not
hardier
given
a
good
dry
kennel
and
plenty
of
straw
no
weather
is
too
cold
for
them
damp
of
course
must
be
avoided
but
this
applies
equally
to
other
breeds
the
adult
hound
like
the
puppy
should
never
be
kept
on
chain
a
kennel
with
a
run
should
be
provided
or
a
loose
box
makes
a
capital
place
for
those
kept
out
of
doors
otherwise
no
different
treatment
is
required
from
that
of
other
large
breeds
chapter
xviii
the
greyhound
the
greyhound
is
the
oldest
and
most
conservative
of
all
dogs
and
his
type
has
altered
singularly
little
during
the
seven
thousand
years
in
which
he
is
known
to
have
been
cherished
for
his
speed
and
kept
by
men
for
running
down
the
gazelle
or
coursing
the
hare
the
earliest
references
to
him
are
far
back
in
the
primitive
ages
long
before
he
was
beautifully
depicted
by
assyrian
artists
straining
at
the
leash
or
racing
after
his
prey
across
the
desert
sands
the
egyptians
loved
him
and
appreciated
him
centuries
before
the
pyramids
were
built
in
those
days
he
wore
a
feathered
tail
and
his
ears
were
heavy
with
a
silken
fringe
of
hair
his
type
was
that
of
the
modern
arabian
slughi
who
is
the
direct
and
unaltered
descendant
of
the
ancient
hound
the
glorious
king
solomon
referred
to
him
proverbs
xxx
as
being
one
of
the
four
things
which
go
well
and
are
comely
in
going
a
lion
which
is
strongest
among
beasts
and
turneth
not
away
from
any
a
greyhound
an
he
goat
also
and
a
king
against
whom
there
is
no
rising
up
that
the
greyhound
is
comely
in
going
as
well
as
in
repose
was
recognised
very
early
by
the
greeks
whose
artists
were
fond
of
introducing
this
graceful
animal
as
an
ornament
in
their
decorative
workmanship
in
their
metal
work
their
carvings
in
ivory
and
stone
and
more
particularly
as
parts
in
the
designs
on
their
oil
bottles
wine
coolers
and
other
vases
the
greyhound
is
frequently
to
be
seen
sometimes
following
the
hare
and
always
in
remarkably
characteristic
attitudes
usually
these
greek
greyhounds
are
represented
with
prick
ears
but
occasionally
the
true
rose
ear
is
shown
all
writings
in
connection
with
greyhounds
point
to
the
high
estimation
in
which
the
dog
has
always
been
held
caius
when
referring
to
the
name
says
the
greyhound
hath
his
name
of
this
word
gre
which
word
soundeth
gradus
in
latin
in
englishe
degree
because
among
all
dogges
these
are
the
most
principall
occupying
the
chiefest
place
and
being
simply
and
absolutely
the
best
of
the
gentle
kinde
of
houndes
it
was
not
until
the
reign
of
queen
elizabeth
that
coursing
in
england
was
conducted
under
established
rules
these
were
drawn
up
by
the
then
duke
of
norfolk
the
sport
quickly
grew
in
favour
and
continued
to
increase
in
popularity
until
the
first
coursing
club
was
established
at
swaffham
in
then
in
the
ashdown
park
meeting
came
into
existence
the
newmarket
meeting
in
was
the
next
fixture
that
was
inaugurated
and
this
now
remains
with
the
champion
stakes
as
its
most
important
event
afterwards
came
the
amesbury
meeting
in
but
amesbury
like
ashdown
although
for
many
years
one
of
the
most
celebrated
institutions
of
the

it

the
waterloo
cup
holds
the
same
position
in
coursing
circles
as
the
derby
does
in
horse
racing
the
national
coursing
club
was
established
in
when
a
stud
book
was
commenced
and
a
code
of
laws
drawn
up
for
the
regulation
of
coursing
meetings
this
is
recognised
in
australia
and
other
parts
of
the
world
where
coursing
meetings
are
held
the
stud
book
of
which
lamonby
is
the
keeper
contains
particulars
of
all
the
greyhounds
in
the
united
kingdom
and
a
dog
is
not
allowed
to
compete
at
any
of
the
large
meetings
held
under
coursing
club
rules
unless
it
has
been
duly
entered
with
its
pedigree
complete
in
fact
the
national
coursing
club
is
more
particular
in
connection
with
the
pedigrees
of
greyhounds
being
correctly
given
than
the
kennel
club
is
about
dogs
that
are
exhibited
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
it
holds
the
same
position
in
coursing
matters
as
the
jockey
club
does
in
racing
it
is
in
fact
the
supreme
authority
on
all
matters
connected
with
coursing
various
opinions
have
been
advanced
as
to
the
best
size
and
weight
for
a
greyhound
like
horses
greyhounds
run
in
all
forms
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
really
good
big
one
will
always
have
an
advantage
over
the
little
ones
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
find
the
former
and
most
of
the
chief
winners
of
the
waterloo
cup
have
been
comparatively
small
coomassie
was
the
smallest
greyhound
that
ever
won
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
leash
she
drew
the
scale
at
and
was
credited
with
the
win
of
the
cup
on
two
occasions
bab
at
the
bowster
who
is
considered
by
many
good
judges
to
have
been
the
best
bitch
that
ever
ran
was
lbs
more
she
won
the
cup
once
and
many
other
stakes
as
she
was
run
all
over
the
country
and
was
not
kept
for
the
big
event
master
mcgrath
was
a
small
dog
and
only
weighed
but
he
won
the
waterloo
cup
three
times
fullerton
who
was
a
much
bigger
dog
and
was
four
times
declared
the
winner
of
the
cup
was
lbs
in
weight
there
are
very
few
greyhounds
that
have
won
the
waterloo
cup
more
than
once
but
cerito
was
credited
with
it
three
times
namely
in
and
when
it
was
a

canaradzo
bit
of
fashion
miss
glendine
herschel
thoughtless
beauty
and
fabulous
fortune
are
probably
some
of
the
best
greyhounds
that
ever
ran
besides
those
already
alluded
to
bit
of
fashion
was
the
dam
of
fullerton
who
shares
with
master
mcgrath
the
reputation
of
being
the
two
best
greyhounds
that
ever
ran
but
master
mcgrath
came
first
during
his
remarkable
career
in
public
he
won
courses
out
of
the
only
time
that
he
was
defeated
being
the
at
his
third
attempt
to
win
the
waterloo
cup
and
the
flag
went
up
in
favour
of
trevor
lady
lyons
he
however
retrieved
his
good
fortune
the
following
year
when
he
again
ran
through
the
stake
fullerton
who
when
he
won
all
his
honours
was
the
property
of
colonel
north
was
bred
by
james
dent
in
northumberland
colonel
north
gave
guineas
for
him
which
was
then
stated
to
be
the
highest
price
ever
paid
for
a
greyhound
he
ran
five
times
altogether
for
the
waterloo
cup
and
was
declared
the
winner
on
four
occasions
the
first
time
was
in
when
he
divided
with
his
kennel
companion
troughend
then
he
won
the
cup
outright
the
three
following
years
in
however
after
having
been
put
to
the
stud
at
which
he
proved
a
failure
he
was
again
trained
for
the
cup
but
age
had
begun
to
tell
its
tale
and
after
winning
one
course
he
was
beaten
by
keating
full
captain
in
the
second
this
was
one
of
the
two
occasions
upon
which
out
of
courses
he
failed
to
raise
the
flag
on
the
other
he
was
beaten
by
gladstone
greengage
when
running
the
deciding
course
at
haydock
park
it
appears
like
descending
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
to
mention
the
greyhound
as
a
show
dog
after
the
many
brilliant
performances
that
have
been
recorded
of
him
in
the
leash
but
there
are
many
dogs
elegant
in

with
fine

development
that
are
to
be
seen

as
a

the
most

in

have
not
been
noted
for
their
good
looks
there
have
been
exceptions
in
which
the
opposite
has
been

the
whippet
for
elegance
of
style
cleanliness
of
habit
and
graceful
movement
few
dogs
can
equal
the
whippet
for
which
reason
his
popularity
as
a
companion
has
increased
very
greatly
within
the
past
decade
no
more
affectionate
creature
is
to
be
found
yet
he
possesses
considerable
determination
and
pluck
and
on
occasion
will
defend
himself
in
his
own
way
too
fragile
in
his
anatomy
for
fighting
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
when
molested
he
will
snap
at
his
opponent
with
such
celerity
as
to
take
even
the
most
watchful
by
surprise
while
his
strength
of
jaw
combined
with
its
comparatively
great
length
enables
him
to
inflict
severe
punishment
at
the
first
grab
it
was
probably
owing
to
this
habit
which
is
common
to
all
whippets
that
they
were
originally
known
as
the
whippet
existed
as
a
separate
breed
long
before
dog
shows
were
thought
of
and
at
a
time
when
records
of
pedigrees
were
not
officially
preserved
but
it
is
very
certain
that
the
greyhound
had
a
share
in
his
genealogical
history
for
not
only
should
his
appearance
be
precisely
that
of
a
greyhound
in
miniature
but
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
bred
is
very
similar
to
that
for
which
his
larger
prototype
is
still
used
the
only
difference
being
that
rabbits
were
coursed
by
whippets
and
hares
by
greyhounds
this
sport
has
been
mainly
confined
to
the
working
classes
the
colliers
of
lancashire
yorkshire
durham
and
northumberland
being
particularly
devoted
to
it
as
a
rule
the
contests
are
handicaps
the
starting
point
of
each
competitor
being
regulated
by
its
weight
but
the
winners
of
previous
important
events
are
penalised
in
addition
according
to
their
presumed
merit
by
having
a
certain
number
of
yards
deducted
from
the
start
to
which
weight
alone
would
otherwise
have
entitled
them
each
dog
is
taken
to
its
stipulated
mark
according
to
the
handicap
and
there
laid
hold
of
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
real
starter
stands
behind
the
lot
and
after
warning
all
to
be
ready
discharges
a
pistol
upon
which
each
attendant
swings
his
dog
as
far
forward
as
he
can
possibly
throw
him
but
always
making
sure
that
he
alights
on
his
feet
the
distance
covered
in
the
race
is
generally
yards
minus
the
starts
allotted
and
some
idea
of
the
speed
at
which
these
very
active
little
animals
can
travel
may
be
gleaned
from
the
fact
that
the
full
distance
has
been
covered
in
rather
under
seconds
in
order
to
induce
each
dog
to
do
its
best
the
owner
or
more
probably
the
trainer
stands
beyond
the
winning
post
and
frantically
waves
a
towel
or
very
stout
rag
accompanied
by
a
babel
of
noise
the
race
is
started
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
the
competitors
reach
the
goal
one
and
all
as
they
finish
taking
a
flying
leap
at
their
trainer
towel
to
which
they
hold
on
with
such
tenacity
that
they
are
swung
round
in
the
air
the
speed
at
which
they
are
travelling
makes
this
movement
necessary
in
many
cases
to
enable
the
dog
to
avoid
accident
particularly
where
the
space
beyond
the
winning
mark
is
limited
for
racing
purposes
there
is
a
wide
margin
of
size
allowed
to
the
dogs
anything
from
lbs
to
or
even
more
being
eligible
but
in
view
of
the
handicap
terms
those
dogs
which
possess
speed
and
scale
to
lbs
amongst
the
and
over
lbs
in
the
heavy
ones
are
considered
to
have
the
best
chance
probably
there
is
no
locality
where
the
pastime
has
maintained
such
a
firm
hold
as
in
and
around
oldham
one
of
the
most
famous
tracks
in
the
world
being
at
higginshaw
where
not
infrequently
three
hundred
dogs
are
entered
in
one
handicap
the
borough
grounds
at
oldham
and
the
wellington
grounds
at
bury
are
also
noted
centres
for
races
it
is
a
remarkable
but
well
recognised
fact
that
bitches
are
faster
than
dogs
and
in
consequence
the
terms
upon
which
they
are
handicapped
are
varied
the
general
custom
is
to
allow
a
dog
to
yards
advantage
for
every
pound
difference
in
weight
between
it
and
the
gentle
sex
one
of
the
fastest
dogs
that
ever
ran
was
collier
lad
but
he
was
almost
a
greyhound
as
regards
size
whitefoot
whose
owner
challenged
the
world
and
was
considered
to
be
quite
unbeatable
was
a
whippet
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
was
a
nice
medium
weight
though
probably
capplebank
time
of
seconds
stands
alone
the
best
of
the
racing
dogs
are
polly
fro
astley
lbs
and
dinah
lbs
and
of
those
which
promise
well
for
the
future
eva
whose
weight
is
only
is
most
prominent
the
training
of
whippets
is
by
no
means
easy
work
and
is
more
expensive
than
most
people
imagine
the
very
choicest
food
is
deemed
absolutely
necessary
in
fact
a
whippet
undergoing
preparation
for
an
important
race
is
provided
with
the
most
wholesome
fare
choice
and
similar
dainties
comprise
their
daily
portion
of
course
exercise
is
a
necessity
but
it
is
not
considered
good
policy
to
allow
a
dog
in
training
to
gambol
about
either
on
the
roads
or
in
the
fields
indeed
all
dogs
which
are
undergoing
preparation
for
a
race
are
practically
deprived
of
their
freedom
in
lieu
of
which
they
are
walked
along
hard
roads
secured
by
a
lead
and
for
fear
of
their
picking
up
the
least
bit
of
refuse
each
is
securely
muzzled
by
a
leather
arrangement
which
completely
envelops
the
jaws
but
which
is
freely
perforated
to
permit
proper
breathing
any
distance
between
six
and
a
dozen
miles
a
day
according
to
the
stamina
and
condition
of
the
dog
is
supposed
to
be
the
proper
amount
of
exercise
and
scales
are
brought
into
use
every
few
days
to
gauge
the
effect
which
is
being
produced
in
addition
to
this
private
trials
are
necessary
in
the
presence
of
someone
who
is
accustomed
to
timing
races
by
the
aid
of
a
a
by
no
means
easy
task
considering
that
a
slight
particle
of
a
second
means
so
many
yards
and
the
average
speed
working
out
at
about
yards
per
second
nearly
twice
as
fast
as
the
fastest
pedestrian
sprinter
and
altogether
beyond
the
power
of
the
fleetest
colour
in
the
whippet
is
absolutely
of
no
importance
to
a
good
judge
though
possibly
what
is
known
as
the
peach
fawn
is
the
favourite
among
amateur
fanciers
red
fawns
blue
or
slate
coloured
black
brindled
of
various
shades
and
these
colours
intermingled
with
white
are
most
to
be
met
with
however
in
some
quarters
the
idea
is
prevalent
that
whippets
are
delicate
in
their
constitution
but
this
is
a
popular
error
probably
their
disinclination
to
go
out
of
doors
on
their
own
initiative
when
the
weather
is
cold
and
wet
may
account
for
the
opinion
but
given
the
opportunity
to
roam
about
a
house
the
whippet
will
find
a
comfortable
place
and
will
rarely
ail
anything
in
scores
of
houses
whippets
go
to
bed
with
the
children
and
are
so
clean
that
even
scrupulous
housewives
take
no
objection
to
their
finding
their
way
under
the
clothes
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
thereby
securing
their
own
protection
and
serving
as
an
excellent
footwarmer
in
the
winter
months
probably
in
no
other
breed
except
the
greyhound
do
judges
attach
so
little
importance
to
the
shape
of
the
head
so
long
as
the
jaws
are
fairly
long
and
the
colour
of
the
eyes
somewhat
in
keeping
with
that
of
the
body
very
little
else
is
looked
for
in
front
of
the
ears
as
in
the
case
of
racing
competitors
really
good
dogs
for
show
purposes
are
much
more
difficult
to
find
than
bitches
the
best
of
the
males
are
not
so
classical
in
outline
as
the
females
though
some
of
them
are
as
good
in
legs
and
feet
points
which
are
of
the
greatest
importance
though
it
is
not
quite
in
accordance
with
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
club
it
will
be
found
that
most
judges
favour
dogs
which
are
about
lbs
weight
and
bitches
which
are
between
lbs
and
the
lbs
mentioned
in
the
standard
of
points
without
variation
for
sex
being
considered
altogether
too
heavy
appearances
are
sometimes
deceptive
but
these
dogs
are
rarely
weighed
for
exhibition
purposes
the
trained
eye
of
the
judge
being
sufficient
guide
to
the
size
of
the
competitors
according
to
his
partiality
for
big
or
little
animals
the
south
durham
and
yorkshire
show
at
darlington
has
the
credit
for
first
introducing
classes
for
whippets
into
the
prize
ring
previous
to
this
it
had
not
long
been
generally
recognised
as
a
distinct
breed
and
it
is
within
the
last
twenty
years
that

the
foxhound
there
is
plenty
of
proof
that
foxhounds
were
the
very
first
of
the
canine
races
in
great
britain
to
come
under
the
domination
of
scientific
breeding
there
had
been
hounds
of
more
ancient
origin
such
as
the
southern
hound
and
the
bloodhound
but
something
different
was
wanted
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
hunt
the
wild
deer
that
had
become
somewhat
scattered
after
cromwell
civil
war
the
demand
was
consequently
for
a
quicker
hound
than
those
hitherto
known
and
people
devoted
to
the
chase
began
to
breed
it
whether
there
were
crosses
at
first
remains
in
dispute
but
there
is
more
probability
that
the
policy
adopted
was
one
of
selection
those
exceptionally
fast
were
bred
with
the
same
until
the
slow
steady
line
hunter
was
improved
out
of
his
very
character
and
shape
at
any
rate
there
are
proofs
that
in
hounds
were
to
be
found
in
packs
carefully
bred
and
that
at
that
time
some
of
the
hunts
in
question
devoted
attention
to
the
fox
the
first
known
kennel
of
all
was
at
wardour
castle
and
was
said
to
have
been
established
in
but
more
reliable
is
the
date
of
the
brocklesby
commenced
in
the
first
record
of
a
pack
of
hounds
being
sold
was
in
when
a
fownes
sold
his
pack
to
a
bowles
the
latter
gentleman
showed
great
sport
with
them
in
yorkshire
at
that
time
lord
hertford
began
to
hunt
the
cotswold
country
in
gloucestershire
and
was
the
first
to
draw
coverts
for
fox
in
the
modern
style
very
soon
after
this
it
became
the
fashion
of
the
day
to
breed
hounds
many
of
the
nobility
and
large
landowners
devoted
much
of
their
time
and
money
to
it
and
would
take
long
journeys
to
get
fresh
blood
it
was
the
rule
to
breed
hounds
on
the
most
scientific
principles
and
by
there
were
fifty
such
breeders
including
the
fifth
duke
of
beaufort
lord
lincoln
lord
stamford
lord
percival
lord
granby
lord
ludlow
lord
vernon
lord
carlisle
lord
mexbro
sir
walter
vavasour
sir
roland
winns
noel
stanhope
meynell
barry
and
charles
pelham
the
gentleman
afterward
the
first
lord
yarborough
was
perhaps
the
most
indefatigable
of
all
as
he
was
the
first
to
start
the
system
of
walking
puppies
amongst
his
tenantry
on
the
brocklesby
estates
and
of
keeping
lists
of
hound
pedigrees
and
ages
by
all
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
had
been
breeding
from
each
other
kennels
the
hounds
were
registered
as
can
be
seen
now
in
lord
middleton
private
kennel
stud
book
through
which
his
lordship
can
trace
the
pedigrees
of
his
present
pack
for
a
hundred
and
sixty
years
to
hounds
that
were
entered
in
got
by
raytor
son
of
merryman
and
grandson
of
lord
granby
ranter
another
pedigree
was
that
of
ruby
who
is
credited
with
a
numerous
progeny
as
she
was
by
raytor
out
of
stapleton
cruel
by
sailor
a
son
of
lord
granby
sailor
by
noel
victor
this
shows
well
how
seriously
foxhound
breeding
was
gone
into
before
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
portraits
prove
also
that
a
hound
approaching
very
closely
to
those
of
modern
times
had
been
produced
at
this
early
period
by
such
evidence
the
foxhound
had
outstripped
the
harrier
in
size
by
nearly
five
inches
as
the
latter
does
not
appear
to
have
been
more
than
eighteen
inches
and
the
early
foxhound
would
have
been
inches
then
the
heavy
shoulder
the
dewlap
and
jowl
of
the
southern
hound
had
been
got
rid
of
and
the
coat
had
been
somewhat
altered
the
old
school
of
breeders
had
evidently
determined
upon
great
speed
and
the
ability
to
stay
through
the
medium
of
deep
ribs
heart
room
wide
loins
length
of
quarter
quality
of
bone
straightness
of
and
round
strong
feet
the
slack
loined
loosely
built
and
splayfooted
hound
of
former
generations
had
been
left
behind
to
such
perfection
indeed
had
the
foxhound
attained
that
long
before
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
sportsmen
were
clamouring
as
to
what
a
foxhound
could
do
with
so
much
prominence
given
to
the
foxhound
in
the
comparatively
short
period
of
forty
or
fifty
years
it
is
no
wonder
that
individual
hounds
became
very
celebrated
in
almost
every
part
of
the
country
pelham
rockwood
tickler
and
bumper
were
names
well
known
in
yorkshire
and
lord
ludlow
powerful
and
growler
were
talked
of
both
in
lincolnshire
and
warwickshire
from
the
first
indeed
it
appeared
that
certain
hounds
were
very
much
better
than
others
and
old
huntsmen
have
generally
declared
for
one
which
was
in
the
whole
length
of
their
careers
sometimes
extending
to
fifty
years
immeasurably
superior
to
all
others
they
had
hunted
harry
ayris
who
was
for
just
half
a
century
with

to
the

of
his

that
nothing
had
equalled
cromwell

said
the
same
of

and
frank
gillard
never
falters
from
the
opinion
that
weathergage
was
quite
by
himself
as
the
best
hound
he
ever
hunted
the
foxhound
kennel
stud
book
abounds
in
the
strongest
proofs
that
hereditary
merit
in
their
work
has
been
transmitted
from
these
wonderful
hounds
and
they
really
make
the
history
of
the
foxhound
there
have
been
many
great
hounds
but
there
must
be
the
greatest
of
the
great
and
the
following
twelve

are
probably
the

all
the
pleasures
of
animal
culture
as
the
above
list
so
full
of
extreme
merit
can
be
traced
for
nearly
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
prices
paid
for
foxhounds
in
very
recent
times
have
greatly
exceeded
those
of
the
past
in
colonel
thornton
sold
merkin
for
four
hogsheads
of
claret
and
the
seller
to
have
two
couples
of
the
whelps
then
in
john
warde
sold
a
pack
of
hounds
to
lord
althorpe
for
guineas
and
the
same
gentleman
sold
another
pack
for
the
same
sum
a
few
years
later
in
lord
suffield
offered
guineas
for
lambton
pack
and
afterwards
sold
it
to
sir
matthew
white
ridley
for
in
osbaldeston
sold
ten
couples
of
bitches
all
descendants
of
furrier
for
sovereigns
or
a
hound
a
record
that
was
almost
eclipsed
at
the
sale
of
lord
politmore
hounds
in
when
couples
of
sold
for
guineas
of
late
years
there
has
been
the
sale
of
the
quorn
for
it
was
said
and
the
late
lord
willoughby
de
broke
valued
the
north
warwickshire
for
the
county
to
purchase
at
in
the
atherstone
was
valued
by
rawlence
the
representative
of
tattersall
at
or
something
like
a
hound
and
that
has
been
considered
very
cheap
if
therefore
modern
prices
have
not
greatly
exceeded
those
of
the
far
past
there
has
not
been
any
particular
diminution
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
if
certain
packs
could
be
purchased
the
prices
would
far
exceed
anything
ever
reached
before
foxhounds
have
very
much
improved
in
looks
during
the
past
years
and
unquestionably
they
are
quite
as
good
in
the
field
or
better
whenever
hounds
have
good
foxes
in
front
of
them
and
good
huntsmen
to
assist
or
watch
over
them
they
are
as
able
as
ever
notwithstanding
that
the
drawbacks
to
good
sport
are
more
numerous
now
than
they
used
to
be
the
noble
hound
will
always
be
good
enough
and
ever
and
anon
this
is
shown
by
a
run
of
the
great
wood
order
to
hunt
over
to
thirty
miles
at
a
pace
to
settle
all
the
horses
and
yet
every
hound
will
be
up
there
has
been
a
slight
tendency
to
increase
size
of
late
years
the
belvoir
is
within
very
little
of
inches
instead
of
the
standard
of
twenty
years
ago
and
this
increase
has
become
very
general
in
elegance
of
form
nothing
has
been
lost

there
can
be
no
other

the
harrier
and
the
beagle
the
harrier
is
a
distinct
breed
of
hound
used
for
hunting
the
hare
or
rather
it
should
be
said
the
association
of
masters
of
harriers
are
doing
their
utmost
to
perpetuate
this
breed
the
harrier
stud
book
bearing
witness
thereto
and
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
so
many
masters
of
harriers
ignore
this
fact
and
are
content
to
go
solely
to
foxhound
kennels
to
start
their
packs
of
harriers
choosing
maybe
inch
to
inch
foxhounds
and
thenceforth
calling
them
harriers
it
is
indeed
a
common
belief
that
the
modern
harrier
is
but
a
smaller
edition
of
the
foxhound
employed
for
hunting
the
hare
instead
of
the
fox
and
it
is
almost
useless
to
reiterate
that
it
is
a
distinct
breed
of
hound
that
can
boast
of
possibly
greater
antiquity
than
any
other
or
to
insist
upon
the
fact
that
xenophon
himself
kept
a
pack
of
harriers
over
two
thousands
years
ago
nevertheless
in
general
appearance
the
harrier
and
the
foxhound
are
very
much
alike
the
one
obvious
distinction
being
that
of
size
opinions
differ
as
to
what
standard
of
height
it
is
advisable
to
aim
at
if
you
want
to
hunt
your
harriers
on
foot
inches
is
quite
big
enough
almost
too
big
to
run
with
but
if
you
are
riding
to
them
inches
is
a
useful
height
or
even
inches
either
is
a
good
workable
size
and
such
hounds
should
be
able
to
slip
along
fast
enough
for
most
people
choose
your
hounds
with
plenty
of
bone
but
not
too
clumsy
or
heavy
a
round
firm
neck
not
too
short
with
a
curve
a
lean
head
with
a
long
muzzle
and
fairly
short
ears
a
broad
chest
with
plenty
of
lung
room
like
gun
barrels
straight
and
strong
with
good
thighs
and
well
let
down
hocks
feet
round
like
cats
feet
and
a
tapering
stern
such
a
make
and
shape
should
see
many
seasons
through
and
allow
you
to
be
certain
of
pace
and
endurance
in
your
pack
it
is
useless
to
lay
down
any
hard
and
fast
rule
as
to
colour
it
is
so
much
a
matter
of
individual
taste
some
masters
have
a
great
fancy
for
the
dark
colouring
of
the
old
southern
hound
but
nothing
could
look
much
smarter
than
a
good
combination
of
belvoir
tan
with
black
and
white
puppies
as
a
rule
a
week
or
two
after
they
are
whelped
show
a
greater
proportion
of
dark
marking
than
any
other
but
this
as
they
grow
older
soon
alters
and
their
white
marking
becomes
much
more
conspicuous
as
in
the
case
of
the
foxhound
the
harrier
is
very
seldom
kept
as
a
companion
apart
from
the
pack
but
puppies
are
usually
sent
out
to
walk
and
may
easily
be
procured
to
be
kept
and
reared
until
they
are
old
enough
to
be
entered
to
their
work
doubtless
the
rearing
of
a
harrier
puppy
is
a
great
responsibility
but
it
is
also
a
delight
to
many
who
feel
that
they
are
helping
in
the
advancement
of
a
great
national
sport
there
is
nothing
to
surpass
the
beauty
of
the
beagle
either
to
see
him
on
the
flags
of
his
kennel
or
in
unravelling
a
difficulty
on
the
line
of
a
dodging
hare
in
neatness
he
is
really
the
little
model
of
a
foxhound
he
is
of
course
finer
but
with
the
length
of
neck
so
perfect
in
the
bigger
hound
the
little
shoulders
of
the
same
pattern
and
the
typical
quarters
and
second
thighs
then
how
quick
he
is
in
his
casts
and
when
he
is
fairly
on
a
line
of
course
he
sticks
to
it
as
the
saying
is
like
a
beagle
beagles
have
been
carefully
preserved
for
a
great
many
years
and
in
some
cases
they
have
been
in
families
for
almost
centuries
in
the
hereditary
hunting
establishments
they
have
been
frequently
found
as
the
medium
of
amusement
and
instruction
in
hunting
for
the
juvenile
members
of
the
house
and
there
can
be
nothing
more
likely
to
instil
the
right
principles
of
venery
into
the
youthful
mind
than
to
follow
all
the
ways
of
these
little
hounds
dorsetshire
used
to
be
the
great
county
for
beagles
the
downs
there
were
exactly
fitted
for
them
and
years
ago
when
were
preserved
on
the
large
estates
beagles
were
used
to
hunt
this
small
breed
of
deer
cranes
beagles
were
noted
at
the
time
and
also
those
of

was

them
work
on

about

the
uses
of
the
beagle
in
the
early
days
of
the
last
century
however
were
a
good
deal
diversified
they
were
hunted
in
big
woodlands
to
drive
game
to
the
gun
and
perhaps
the
ordinary
beagle
of
from
inches
to
inches
was
not
big
enough
for
the
requirements
of
the
times
it
is
quite
possible
therefore
that
the
beagle
was
crossed
with
the
welsh
southern
or
otterhound
to
get
more
size
and
power
as
there
certainly
was
a
welsh
beagle
of
good
inches
and
an
almost
identical
contemporary
that
was
called
the
essex
beagle
sixty
years
ago
such
hounds
were
common
enough
but
possibly
through
the
adoption
of
the
more
prevalent
plan
of
beating
coverts
and
spaniels
being
in
more
general
use
the
vocation
of
the
beagle
in
this
particular
direction
died
out
and
a
big
beagle
is
now
very
rarely
seen
that
a
great
many
of
the
true
order
were
bred
became
very
manifest
as
soon
as
the
harrier
and
beagle
association
was
formed
and
more
particularly
when
a
section
of
the
peterborough
hound
show
was
reserved
for
them
then
they
seemed
to
spring
from
every
part
of
the
country
in
one
became
well
acquainted
with
many
packs
that
had
apparently
held
aloof
from
the
dog
shows
there
was
the
cheshire
the
christ
church
oxford
johnson
the
royal
rock
the
thorpe
satchville
the

and
of
late
there
have
been
many
more

well

never

so
the
development
of
the
beagle
as
seen
at
recent
shows
is
somewhat
new
it
is
just
as
it
should
be

if
more
people
take
up

it
may
not
be
in

surprising
they
are

chapter
xxii
the
pointer
it
has
never
been
made
quite
clear
in
history
why
the
spaniards
had
a
dog
that
was
very
remarkable
for
pointing
all
kinds
of
game
they
have
always
been
a
people
certainly
but
more
inclined
to
than
and
yet
as
early
as
they
must
have
had
a
better
dog
for
than
could
have
been
found
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
singularly
enough
too
the
most
esteemed
breeds
in
many
countries
can
be
traced
from
the
same
source
such
as
the
russian
pointer
the
german
pointer
the
french
griffon
and
far
more
important
still
the
english
pointer
a
view
has
been
taken
that
the
spanish
pointer
was
introduced
into
england
about
two
hundred
years
ago
when
were
beginning
to
be
popular
for
fowling
purposes
setters
and
spaniels
had
been
used
to
find
and
drive
birds
into
nets
but
as
the
spanish
pointer
became
known
it
was
apparently
considered
that
he
alone
had
the
capacity
to
find
game
for
the
gun
this
must
have
been
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
for
the
next
fifty
years
at
least
something
very
slow
was
wanted
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
flintlock
gun
which
occupied
many
minutes
in
loading
and
getting
into
position
improvements
came
by
degrees
until
they
set
in
very
rapidly
but
probably
by
when
hunting
had
progressed
a
good
deal
and
pace
was
increased
in
all
pastimes
the
pointer
was
voted
a
nuisance
through
his
extreme
caution
and
movements
there
is
evidence
through
portraits
that
pointers
had
been
altogether
changed
by
the
year
but
it
is
possible
that
the
breed
then
had
been
continued
by
selection
rather
than
by
crossing
for
a
couple
of
decades
as
it
is
quite
certain
that
by
sportsmen
were
still
dissatisfied
with
the
want
of
pace
in
the
pointer
and
many
sportsmen
are
known
to
have
crossed
their
pointers
with
foxhounds
at
about
that
time
by
the
old
spanish
pointer
had
been
left
behind
and
the
english
dog
was
a
perfect
model
for
pace
stamina
resolution
and
nerve
the
breed
was
exactly
adapted
to
the
requirements
of
that
day
which
was
not
quite
as
fast
as
the
present
men
shot
with
good
joe
mantons
did
their
own
loading
and
walked
to
their
dogs
working
them
right
and
left
by
hand
and
whistle
the
dogs
beat
their
ground
methodically
their
heads
at
the
right
level
for
body
scent
and
when
they
came
on
game
down
they
were
the
dog
that
had
got
it
pointing
and
the
other
barking
or
awaiting
developments
there
was
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
work
of
a
and
brace
of
pointers
or
more
perfect
than
the
way
a
man
got
his
shots
from
them
there
was
nothing
slow
about
them
but
on
the
contrary
they
went
a
great
pace
seemed
to
shoot
into
the
very
currents
of
air
for
scent
and
yet
there
was
no
impatience
about
them
such
as
might
have
been
expected
from
the
foxhound
cross
the
truth
of
it
was
that
the
capacity
to
concentrate
the
whole
attention
on
the
object
found
was
so
intense
as
to
have
lessened
every
other
propensity
the
rush
of
the
foxhound
had
been
absorbed
by
the
additional
force
of
the
pointer
character
there
has
been
nothing
at
all
like
it
in
canine
culture
and
it
came
out
so
wonderfully
after
men
had
been
shooting
in
the
above
manner
for
about
forty
years
it
was
nearing
the
end
of
this
period
that
field
trials
began
to
occupy
the
attention
of
breeders
and
sportsmen
and
although
setters
had
been
getting
into
equal
repute
for
the
beauty
of
their
work
there
was
something
more
brilliant
about
the
pointers
at
first
bounce
was
a
magnificent
dog
a
winner
on
the
show
bench
and
of
the
first
field
trial
in
england
newton
ranger
was
another
of
the
early
performers
and
he
was
very
staunch
and
brilliant
but
it
was
in
the
next
five
years
that
the
most
extraordinary
pointer
merit
was
seen
as
quite
incomparable
was
sir
richard
garth
drake
who
was
just
five
generations
from
the
spanish
pointer
drake
was
rather
a
tall
gaunt
dog
but
with
immense
depth
of
girth
long
shoulders
long
haunches
and
a
benevolent
quiet
countenance
there
was
nothing
very
attractive
about
him
when
walking
about
at
stafford
prior
to
his
trial
but
the
moment
he
was
down
he
seemed
to
paralyse
his
opponent
as
he
went
half
as
fast
again
it
was
calculated
that
he
went
fifty
miles
an
hour
and
at
this
tremendous
pace
he
would
stop
as
if
petrified
and
the
momentum
would
cover
him
with
earth
and
dust
he
did
not
seem
capable
of
making
a
mistake
and
his
birds
were
always
at
about
the
same
distance
from
him
to
show
thereby
his
extraordinary
nose
and
confidence
nothing
in
his
day
could
beat
him
in
a
field
he
got
some
good
stock
but
they
were
not
generally
show
form
the
bitches
by
him
being
mostly
light
and
small
and
his
sons
a
bit
high
on
the
leg
none
of
them
had
his
pace
but
some
were
capital
performers
such
as
sir
thomas
lennard
mallard
george
pilkington
tory
lloyd
price
luck
of
edenhall
winner
of
the
field
trial
derby
lord
downe
mars
and
bounce
and
barclay
field
riot
when
sir
richard
garth
went
to
india
and
sold
his
kennel
of
pointers
at
tattersall
lloyd
price
gave
guineas
for
drake
the
owners
and
breeders
had
probably
all
the
advantages
of
what
a
past
generation
had
done
as
there
were
certainly
many
wonderful
pointers
in
the
and
as
old
men
living
will
freely
allow
they
were
produced
very
regularly
too
in
a
marvellous
type
of
perfection
william
arkwright
of
sutton
scarsdale
derbyshire
has
probably
the
best
kennel
in
england
at
the
present
time
he
discovered
and
revived
an
old
breed
of
the
north
of
england
that
was
black
and
bred
for
a
great
many
years
by
pape
of
carlisle
and
his
father
before
him
with
these
arkwright
has
bred
to
the
best
working
strains
with
the
result
that
he
has
had
many
good
field
trial
winners
for
a
good
many
years
now
elias
bishop
of
newton
abbot
has
kept
up
the
old
breeds
of
devon
pointers
the
ch
bangs
the
mikes
and
the
brackenburg
romps
and
his
have
been
amongst
the
best
at
the
shows
and
the
field
trials
during
the
past
few
years
there
are
of
course
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
many
of
the
modern
pointers
do
not
carry
about
them
the
air
of
their
true
business
but
it
would
appear
that
fewer
people
keep
them
now
than
was
the
case
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
owing
to
the
advance
of
otherwise
driving
and
the
consequent
falling
away
of
the
methods
both
for
the
stubble
and
the
moor
however
there
are
many
still
who
enjoy
the
work
of
dogs
and
it
would
be
a
sin
indeed
in
the
calendar
of
british
sports
if
the
fine
old
breed
of
pointer
were
allowed
even
to
deteriorate
the
apparent
danger
is
that
the
personal
or
individual
element
is
dying
out
in
the
the
name
of
drake
bang
or
garnet
were
like
household
words
people
talked
of
the
great
pointers
they
were
spoken
of
in
club
chat
or
gossip
written
about
and
the
prospects
of
the
moors
were
much
associated
with
the
characters
of
the
pointers
and
setters
there
is
very
little
of
this
sort
of
talk
guns
are
more
critically
spoken
of
there
is
however
a
wide
enough
world
to
supply
with
pointers
in
england
numerous
colonies
it
may
be
much
more
fitting
to
shoot
over
dogs
it
has
been
tried
in
south
africa
with
marvellous
results
descendants
of
bang
have
delighted
the
lone
colonist
on
cape
partridge
and
quails
and
pointers
suit
the
climate
whereas
setters
do
not
the
pointer
is
a
noble
breed
to
take
up
as
those
still
in
middle
life
have
seen
its
extraordinary
merit
whenever
bred
in
the
right
way
as
to
the
essential
points
of
the
breed
they
may
be
set
down
as
follows
head
should
be
wide
from
ear
to
ear
long
and
slanting
from
the
top
of

to
the

low
and

neck
the
neck
should
be
very
strong
but
long
and
slightly
arched
meeting
shoulders
well
knit
into
the
back
which
should
be
straight
and
joining
a
wide
loin
there
should
be
great
depth
of
heart
room
very
deep
brisket
narrow
chest
rather
than
otherwise
shoulders
long
and
slanting
legs
and
feet
should
be
as
nearly
like
the
foxhound
as
possible
there
should
be
really
no
difference
as
they
must
be
straight
the
knees
big
and
the
bone
should
be
of
goodly
size
down
to
the
toes
and
the
feet
should
be
very
round
and
a
great
feature
in
the
pointer
is
his
he
can
not
well
be
too
long
in
the
haunch
or
strong
in
the
stifle
which
should
be
well
bent
and
the
muscles
in
the
second
thigh
of
a
good
pointer
are
always
remarkable
the
hocks
may
be
straighter
than
even
in
a
foxhound
as
in
pulling
up
sharp
on
his
point
he
in
a
great
measure
throws
his
weight
on
them
the
shank

the
setters
i
the
english
in
some
form
or
other
setters
are
to
be
found
wherever
guns
are
in
frequent
use
and
irrespective
of
the
precise
class
of
work
they
have
to
perform
but
their
proper
sphere
is
either
on
the
moors
when
the
red
grouse
are
in

or
on

commences
robert
dudley
earl
of
leicester
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
first
person
to
train
setting
dogs
in
the
manner
which
has
been
commonly
adopted
by
his
successors
his
lordship
lived
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
was
therefore
a
contemporary
of
caius
who
may
possibly
have
been
indebted
to
the
earl
for
information
when
in
his
work
on
he
wrote
of
the
setter
under
the
name
of
the
index
though
setters
are
divided
into
three
distinct
varieties
the
english
the
irish
and
the
gordon
or
black
and
tan
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
have
a
common
origin
though
it
is
scarcely
probable
in
view
of
their
dissimilarity
that
the
same
individual
ancestors
can
be
supposed
to
be
their
original
progenitors
nearly
all
authorities
agree
that
the
spaniel
family
is
accountable
on
one
side
and
this
contention
is
borne
out
to
a
considerable
extent
by
old
illustrations
and
paintings
of
setters
at
work
in
which
they
are
invariably
depicted
as
being
very
much
like
the
old
liver
and
white
spaniel
though
of
different
colours
doubt
exists
as
to
the
other
side
of
their
heredity
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
all
those
who
first
bred
them
used
the
same
means
of
the
theories
put
forward
that
which
carries
the
most
presumptive
evidence
must
go
to
the
credit
of
the
old
spanish
pointer
where
else
could
they
inherit
that
wonderful
scenting
power
that
style
in
which
they
draw
up
to
their
game
their
statuesque
attitude
when
on
point
and
above
all
the
staunchness
and
patience
by
which
they
hold
their
game
spellbound
until
the
shooter
has
time
to
walk
leisurely
up
even
from
a
considerable
distance
but
apart
from
the
question
of
their
origin
the
different
varieties
have
many
other
attributes
in
common
all
perform
the
same
kind
of
work
and
in
the
same
manner
consequently
the
system
of
breaking
or
training
them
varies
only
according
to
the
temper
or
ideas
of
those
who
undertake
their
schooling
few
dogs
are
more
admired
than
english
setters
and
those
who
are
looked
upon
as
professional
exhibitors
have
not
been
slow
to
recognise
the
fact
that
when
a
really
good
young
dog
makes
its
appearance
it
is
a
formidable
rival
amongst
all
other
breeds
when
the
special
prizes
come
to
be
allotted
seen
either
at
its
legitimate
work
as
a
gun
dog
or
as
a
domestic
companion
the
english
setter
is
one
of
the
most
graceful
and
beautiful
of
the
canine
race
and
its
elegant
form
and
feathery
coat
command
instant
admiration
twenty
years
ago
it
was
known
by
several
distinct
names
among
the
more
important
being
the
blue
beltons
and
laveracks
and
this
regardless
of
any
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
the
dogs
were
in
any
way
connected
by
relationship
to
the
stock
which
had
earned
fame
for
either
of
these
names
it
was
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
shows
and
some
confusion
on
the
part
of
exhibitors
that
made
it
necessary
for
the
kennel
club
to
classify
under
one
heading
these
and
others
which
had
attained
some
amount
of
notability
and
the
old
terms
have
gradually
been
dropped
doubtless
the
english
setter
club
has
done
much
since
its
institution
in
to
encourage
this
breed
of
dog
and
has
proved
the
usefulness
of
the
club
by
providing
two
very
valuable
trophies
the
challenge
cup
and
the
field
trial
challenge
cup
for
competition
amongst
its
members
besides
having
liberally
supported
all
the
leading
shows
hence
it
has
rightly
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
only
authority
from
which
an
acceptable
and
official
dictum
for
the
guidance
of
others
can
emanate
the
following
is
the
standard
of

preferred
ii
the

though
this
variety
has
not
attained
such
popularity
as
its
english
cousin
it
is
not
because
it
is
regarded
as
being
less
pleasing
to
the
eye
for
in
general
appearance
of
style
and
outline
there
is
very
little
difference
in
fact
none
if
the
chiselling
of
the
head
and
colour
of
the
coat
be
excepted
the
beautiful
rich
golden
chestnut
colour
which
predominates
in
all
specimens
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
account
for
the
great
favour
in
which
they
are
regarded
generally
while
their
disposition
is
sufficiently
engaging
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
who
desire
to
have
a
dog
as
a
companion
rather
than
either
a
very
large
or
very
small
one
probably
this
accounts
for
so
many
lady
exhibitors
in
england
preferring
them
to
the
other
varieties
of
setters
we
have
to
go
over
to
its
native
country
however
to
find
the
breed
most
highly
esteemed
as
a
sporting
dog
for
actual
work
and
there
it
is
naturally
first
favourite
in
fact
very
few
of
either
of
the
other
varieties
are
to
be
met
with
from
one
end
of
the
green
isle
to
the
other
it
has
been
suggested
that
all
irish
setters
are
too
headstrong
to
make
really
field

some
of
them
on
the
contrary
are
quite
as
great
in
speed

not

as
clever
at

business

quite
as
as
other

some
which
have
competed
within
the
past
few
years
at

iii
the
black
and
tan
originally
this
variety
was
known
as
the
gordon
setter
but
this
title
was
only
partly
correct
as
the
particular
dogs
first
favoured
by
the
duke
of
gordon
from
whom
they
took
the
name
were
black
tan
and
white
heavily
built
and
somewhat
clumsy
in
appearance
but
the
introduction
of
the
irish
blood
had
the
effect
of
making
a
dog
more
fashionable
the
presence
of
white
on
the
chest
was
looked
upon
with
disfavour
and
the
kennel
club
settled
the
difficulty
of
name
by
abolishing
the
term
gordon
altogether
very
few
of
this
variety
have
appeared
at
field
trials
for
several
years
past
but
that
can
not
be
considered
a
valid
reason
for
stigmatising
them
as
dogs
as
some
faddists
delight
in
calling
them
on
the
few
occasions
when
the
opportunity
has
been
presented
they
have
acquitted
themselves
at
least
as
well
as
and
on
some
occasions
better
than
their
rivals
of
other
varieties
proving
to
be
as
fast
as
staunch
and
as
obedient
as
any
of
them
a
notable
example
of
this
occurred
during
the
season
of
and
when
isaac
sharpe
stylish
ranger
was
so
remarkably
successful
at
the
trials
it
is
very
difficult
to
account
for
the
lack
of
interest
which
is
taken
in
the
variety
outside
scotland
but
the
fact
remains
that
very
few
have
appeared
at
field
trials
within
recent
years
and
that
only
about
four
owners
are
troubling
the
officials
of
english
shows
regularly
at
the
present
time
in
france
belgium
norway
and
especially
in
russia
this
handsome
sporting
dog
is
a
far
greater
favourite
than
it
is
in
great
britain
not
only
for
work
with
the
gun
but
as
a
companion
and
it
is
a
fact
that
at
many
a
continental
dog
show
more
specimens
of
the
breed
are
exhibited
than
could
be
gathered
together
in
the
whole
of
the
united
kingdom
the
want
of
an
active
organisation
which
would
foster
and
encourage
the
interests
of
the
black
and
tan
setter
is
much
to
be
deplored
and
is
without
doubt
the
chief
cause
of
its
being
so
much
neglected
for
in
these
strenuous
days
when
almost
every
breed
or
variety
of
breed
is
backed
up
by
its
own
votaries
it
can
not
be
expected
that
such
as
are
not
constantly
kept
in
prominence
will
receive
anything
more
than
scant
consideration
the
black
and
tan
setter
is
heavier
than
the
english
or
irish
varieties
but
shows
more
of
the
hound
and
less
of
the
spaniel
the
head
is
stronger
than
that
of
the
english
setter
with
a
deeper
and
broader
muzzle
and
heavier
lips
the
ears
are
also
somewhat
longer
and
the
eyes
frequently
show
the
haw
the
black
should
be
as
jet
and
entirely
free
from
white
the
tan
on
the
cheeks
and
over
the
eyes
on
the
feet
and
pasterns
should
be
bright
and
clearly
defined
and
the
feathering
on
the
and
thighs
should
also
be
a
rich
dark
mahogany
tan
amongst
the
oldest
and
most
successful
owners
of
setters
who
have
consistently
competed
at
field
trials
may
be
mentioned
colonel
cotes
whose
prince
frederick
was
probably
the
most
wonderful
backer
ever
known
arkwright
elias
and
james
bishop
lowe
shorthose
potter
and
smale
who
may
be
considered
the
oldest
setter
judges
and
who
have
owned
dogs
whose
prowess
in
the
field
has
brought
them
high
reputation
warwick
has
within
recent
years
owned
probably
more
winners
at
field
trials
than
any
other
owner
one
of
his
being
compton
bounce
captain
heywood
lonsdale
has
on
several
occasions
proved
the
ightfield
strain
to
be
staunch
and
true
as
witness
the
doughty
deeds
of
duke
of
that
ilk
and
the
splendid
success
he
achieved
at
recent
grouse
trials
in
scotland
with
his
ightfield
rob
roy
mack
and
dot
the
winning
the
stake
and
the
others
being
first
and
third
in
the
puppy
stake
herbert
mitchell
has
been
another
good
patron
of
the
trials
and
has
won
many
important
stakes
williams
has
also
owned
a
few
noted
trial
winners
and
from
scotland
comes
isaac
sharpe
whose
gordon
setter
stylish
ranger
has
effectually
put
a
stop
to
the
silly
argument
that
all
this
breed
are
old
dogs
many
of
the
older
field
trial
men
hold
tenaciously
to
the
opinion
that
the
modern
exhibition
setter
is
useless
for
work
and
contend
that
if
winners
are
to
be
produced
they
must
be
bred
from
noted
working
strains
doubtless
this
prejudice
in
favour
of
working
dogs
has
been
engendered
by
the
circumstance
that
many
owners
of
celebrated
bench
winners
care
nothing
about
their
dogs
being
trained
in
some
cases
generation
after
generation
having
been
bred
simply
for
show
purposes
under
such
conditions
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
capacity
for
fine
scenting
properties
and
the
natural
aptitude
for
quickly
picking
up
a
knowledge
of
their
proper
duties
in
the
field
is
impaired
but
there
is
no
reason
why
a
good
show
dog
should
not
also
be
a
good
worker
and
the
recent
edict
of
the
kennel
club
which
rules
that
no
gun
dog
shall
be
entitled
to
championship
honours
until
it
has
gained
a
certificate
of
merit
in
field
trials
will
doubtless
tend
towards
a
general
improvement
in
the
working
qualities
of
the
breeds
whose
providence
is
in
the
finding
and
retrieving
of
game
chapter
xxiv
the
retrievers
it
is
obviously
useless
to
shoot
game
unless
you
can
find
it
after
it
has
been
wounded
or
killed
and
from
the
earliest
times
it
has
been
the
habit
of
sportsmen
to
train
their
dogs
to
do
the
work
which
they
could
not
always
successfully
do
for
themselves
the
pointers
setters
and
spaniels
of
our
forefathers
were
carefully
broken
not
only
to
find
and
stand
their
game
but
also
to
fetch
the
fallen
birds
this
use
of
the
setting
and
pointing
dog
is
still
common
on
the
continent
and
in
the
united
states
and
there
is
no
inaccuracy
in
a
french
artist
depicting
a
pointer
with
a
partridge
in
its
mouth
or
showing
a
setter
retrieving
waterfowl
the
springer
and
the
old
were
regarded
as
particularly
adroit
in
the
double
work
of
finding
and
retrieving
pointers
and
setters
who
had
been
thus
broken
were
found
to
deteriorate
in
steadiness
in
the
field
and
it
gradually
came
to
be
realised
that
even
the
spaniel
capacity
for
retrieving
was
limited
a
larger
and
quicker
dog
was
wanted
to
divide
the
labour
and
to
be
used
solely
as
a
retriever
in
conjunction
with
the
other
gun
dogs
the
poodle
was
tried
for
retrieving
with
some
success
and
he
showed
considerable
aptitude
in
finding
and
fetching
wounded
wild
duck
but
he
too
was
inclined
to
maul
his
birds
and
deliver
them
dead
even
the
old
english
sheepdog
was
occasionally
engaged
in
the
work
and
various
crosses
with
spaniel
or
setter
and
collie
were
attempted
in
the
endeavour
to
produce
a
grade
breed
having
the
desired
qualities
of
a
good
nose
a
soft
mouth
and
an
understanding
brain
together
with
a
coat
that
would
protect
its
wearer
from
the
ill
effects
of
frequent
immersion
in
water
it
was
when
these
efforts
were
most
active
namely
about
the
year
that
new
material
was
discovered
in
a
dog
recently
introduced
into
england
from
labrador
he
was
a
natural
with
a
constitution
impervious
to
chills
and
entirely
free
from
the
liability
to
ear
canker
which
had
always
been
a
drawback
to
the
use
of
the
spaniel
as
a
retriever
of
waterfowl
moreover
he
was
himself
reputed
to
be
a
born
retriever
of
game
and
remarkably
sagacious
his
importers
called
him
a
spaniel
a
breed
name
which
at
one
time
was
also
applied
to
his
relative
the
newfoundland
probably
there
were
not
many
specimens
of
the
race
in
england
and
although
there
is
no
record
explicitly
saying
so
it
is
conjectured
that
these
were
crossed
with
the
english
setter
producing
what
is
now
familiarly
known
as
the
black
retriever
one
very
remarkable
attribute
of
the
retriever
is
that
notwithstanding
the
known
fact
that
the
parent
stock
was
mongrel
and
that
in
the
early
dogs
the
setter
type
largely
predominated
the
ultimate
result
has
favoured
the
labrador
cross
distinctly
and
prominently
proving
how
potent
even
when
grafted
upon
a
stock
admittedly
various
is
the
blood
of
a
pure
race
and
how
powerful
its
influence
for
fixing
type
and
character
over
the
other
less
vital
elements
with
which
it
is
blended
from
the
first
sportsmen
recognised
the
extreme
value
of
the
new
retrieving
dog
strengthened
and
improved
by
the
labrador
blood
he
had
lost
little
if
any
of
the
setter
beauty
of
form
he
was
a
dignified
substantial
intelligent
affectionate
companion
faithful
talented
highly
cultivated
and
esteemed
in
the
season
and
out
of
it
for
his
mind
as
well
as
his
beauty
it
is
only
comparatively
recently
that
we
have
realised
how
excellent
an
sporting
dog
the
retriever
has
become
in
many
cases
indeed
where
grouse
and
partridge
are
driven
or
a
retriever
is
unquestionably
superior
to
pointer
setter
or
spaniel
and
for
general
work
in
the
field
he
is
the
best
companion
that
a
shooting
man
can
possess
doubtless
in
earlier
days
when
the
art
of
training
was
less
thoroughly
understood
the
breaking
of
a
dog
was
a
matter
of
infinite
trouble
to
breeders
most
of
the
gun
dogs
could
be
taught
by
patience
and
practice
to
retrieve
fur
or
feather
but
game
carefully
and
skilfully
shot
is
easily
rendered
valueless
by
being
mumbled
and
mauled
by
powerful
jaws
not
schooled
to
gentleness
and
this
question
of
a
tender
mouth
was
certainly
one
of
the
problems
that
perturbed
the
minds
of
the
originators
of
the
breed
the
difficulty
was
overcome
by
process
of
selection
and
by
the
exclusion
from
breeding
operations
of
all
specimens
with
the
happy
effect
that
in
the
present
time
it
is
exceptional
to
find
a
working
retriever
who
does
not
know
how
to
bring
his
bird
to
hand
without
injuring
it
a
better
knowledge
of
what
is
expected
of
him
distinguishes
our
modern
retriever
he
knows
his
duty
and
is
intensely
eager
to
perform
it
but
he
no
longer
rushes
off
unbidden
at
the
firing
of
the
gun
he
has
learned
to
remain
at
heel
until
he
is
ordered
by
word
or
gesture
from
his
master
upon
whom
he
relies
as
his
friend
and
director
it
would
be
idle
to
expect
that
the
offspring
of
unbroken
sire
and
dam
can
be
as
easily
educated
as
a
retriever
whose
parents
before
him
have
been
properly
trained
inherited
qualities
count
for
a
great
deal
in
the
adaptability
of
all
sporting
dogs
and
the
reason
why
one
meets
with
so
many
retrievers
that
are
incapable
or
disobedient
or
is
simply
that
their
preliminary
education
has
been
neglected
the
education
which
should
begin
when
the
dog
is
very
young
in
his
earliest
youth
he
should
be
trained
to
prompt
obedience
to
a
given
word
or
a
wave
of
the
hand
it
is
well
to
teach
him
very
early
to
enter
water
or
he
may
be
found
wanting
when
you
require
him
to
fetch
a
bird
from
river
or
lake
lessons
in
retrieving
ought
to
be
a
part
of
his
daily
routine
equally
necessary
is
it
to
break
him
in
to
the
knowledge
that
sheep
and
lambs
are
not
game
to
be
chased
and
that
rabbits
and
hares
are
to
be
discriminated
from
feathered
game
is
often
supposed
to
be
hereditary
but
it
is
not
so
any
puppy
can
be
cured
of
in
half
a
dozen
short
lessons
sir
henry
smith
advice
is
to
get
your
puppy
accustomed
to
the
sound
and
sight
of
a
gun
being
fired
first
at
a
distance
and
gradually
nearer
and
nearer
until
he
knows
that
no
harm
will
come
to
him
companionship
and
sympathy
between
dog
and
master
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
whole
business
and
there
is
a
moral
obligation
between
them
which
ought
never
to
be
strained
both
as
a
worker
and
as
a
show
dog
the
retriever
has
reached
something
very
near
to
the
ideal
standard
of
perfection
which
has
been
consistently
bred
up
to
careful
selection
and
systematic
breeding
backed
up
by
enthusiasm
have
resulted
in
the
production
of
a
dog
combining
useful
working
qualities
with
the
highest
degree
of
beauty
a
very
prominent
admirer
and
breeder
was
the
late
shirley
the
president
of
the
kennel
club
who
owned
many
retrievers
superlative
both
as
workers
and
as
show
dogs
and
who
probably
did
more
for
the
breed
than
any
other
man
of
his
generation

the
general
improvement
of

admirable

the
name
of
the
late
cornwall
legh
must
be
included
many
of
colonel
legh
bitches
were
of
shirley
blood
but
it
is
believed
that
a
breed
of
retrievers
had
existed
at
high
legh
for
several
generations
with
which
a
judicious
cross
was
made
the
result
being
not
only
the
formation
of
a
remarkable
kennel
but
also
a
decided
influence
for
good
upon
the
breed
in
general
but
since
the
shirley
days
when
competition
was
more
limited
than
it
is
at
present
no
kennel
of
retrievers
has
ever
attained
anything
like
the
distinction
of
that
owned
by
reginald
cooke
at
riverside
nantwich
by
acquiring
the
best
specimens
of
the
breed
from
all
available
sources
cooke
has
gathered
together
a
stock
which
has
never
been
equalled
his
ideas
of
type
and
conformation
are
the
outcome
of
close
and
attentive
study
and
consistent
practice
and
one
needs
to
go
to
riverside
if
one
desires
to
see
the
highest
examples
of
what
a
modern
retriever
can
be
since
dr
bond
moore
imparted
to
the
retriever
a
fixity
of
character
the
coats
have
become
longer
and
less
wavy
and
in
conformation
of
skull
colour
of
eye
straightness
of
legs
and
quality
of
bone
there
has
been
a
perceptible
improvement
as
there
is
no
club
devoted
to
the
breed
and
consequently
no
official
standard
of
points
the
following
description
of
the
perfect
retriever
is
offered
general
appearance
that
of
a
bright
and
active
sporting
dog
showing
power
without

weight
from
lb
to
lb
for
dogs
bitches
rather
less
as
a
rule
the
retriever
should
be
chosen
for
the
intelligent
look
of
his
face
and
particular
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
shape
of
his
head
and
to
his
eyes
his
frame
is
important
of
course
but
in
the
retriever
the
mental
qualities
are
of
more
significance
than
bodily
points
there
has
been
a
tendency
in
recent
years
among
retriever
breeders
to
fall
into
the
common
error
of
exaggerating
a
particular
point
and
of
breeding
dogs
with
a
head
far
too
fine
and
narrow
it
is
what
has
been
aptly
called
the
alligator
head
lacking
in
brain
capacity
and
power
of
jaw
a
perfect
head
should
be
long
and
clean
but
neither
weak
nor
snipy
the
eye
should
be
placed
just
halfway
between
the
occiput
and
the
tip
of
the
nose
it
is
pleasing
to
add
that
to
this
beautiful
breed
the
phrase
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
applies
in
full
measure
not
only
is
the
average
retriever
of
a
companionable
disposition
with
delightful
intelligence
that
is
always
responsive
but
he
is
a
good
and
faithful
guard
and
a
courageous
protector
of
person
and
property
it
has
already
been
said
that
the
majority
of
the
retrievers
are
also
good
working
dogs
and
it
may
here
be
added
that
many
of
the
most
successful
working
dogs
are
sired
by
in
the
show
ring
the
retriever
the
retriever
is
commonly
believed
to
be
of
earlier
origin
than
his
relative
and
he
is
of
less
pure
descent
he
probably
owes
ancestral
tribute
to
the
poodle
such
a
cross
may
conceivably
have
been
resorted
to
by
the
early
retriever
breeders
and
there
was
little
to
lose
from
a
merely
sporting
point
of
view
from
this
alien
introduction
for
the
poodle
is
well
known
to
be
by
nature
if
not
by
systematic
training
an
excellent
water
dog
capable
of
being
taught
anything
that
the
canine
mind
can
comprehend
during
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
poodle
was
fairly
plentiful
in
england
and
we
had
no
other
dog
of
similar
size
and
type
apart
from
the
irish
water
spaniel
who
may
himself
lay
claim
to
poodle
relationship
while
as
to
the
retriever
either
curly
or
flat
coated
he
can
in
no
sense
be
assigned
to
any
country
outside
of
great
britain
the
presumption
is
strong
that
the
gentleman
from
france
was
largely
instrumental
in
the
manufacture
of
the
variety
but
whatever
the
origin
of
the
retriever
he
is
a
beautiful
dog
and
one
is
gratified
to
note
that
the
old
prejudice
against
him
and
the
old
indictment
as
to
his
hard
mouth
are
fast
giving
place
to
praise
of
his
intelligence
and
admiration
of
his
working
abilities
speaking
generally
it
seems
to
be
accepted
that
he
is
slightly
inferior
in
nose
to
his
cousin
and
not
quite
so
easy
to
break
but
there
are
many
keepers
and
handlers
who
have
discovered
in
individual
specimens
extraordinary
merit
in
the
field
combined
with
great
endurance
it
is
not
certain
that
any
great
improvement
has
been
effected
in
the
variety
during
recent
years
but
there
are
particular
dogs
who
are
decidedly
better
than
any
that
existed
a
dozen
years
or
more
ago
when
such
celebrities
as
true
old
sam
king
koffee
ben
wonder
doden
ben
lad
and
una
were
prominent
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
curly
coats
attained
show
form
in
advance
of
the
variety
the
coat
of
the
curly
retriever
plays
a
very
important
part
in
his
value
and
personality
there
are
many
kinds
of
coat
but
the
only
true
and
proper
one
is
the
nigger
curl
of
which
each
knot
is
solid
and
inseparable
a
coat
of
this
quality
is
not
capable
of
improvement
by
any
method
of
grooming
for
the
simple
reason
that
its
natural
condition
is
in
itself
perfect
the
little
locks
should
be
so
close
together
as
to
be
impervious
to
water
and
all
parts
of
the
body
should
be
evenly
covered
with
them
including
the
tail
and
legs
a
bad
class
of
coat
and
one
which
readily
yields
to
the
art
is
the
thin
open
curl
which
by
careful
manipulation
can
be
greatly
improved
another
bad
quality
of
coat
is
one
in
which
upon
the
withers
and
over
the
loins
in
particular
the
curls
do
not
tighten
up
naturally
but
are
large
loose
and
soft
to
the
feel
regarding
the
dog
as
a
whole
the
following
may
be
taken
as
an
description
general
appearance
that
of
a
smart
active
and
alert
dog
full
of
go
and
fire
a
sportsman
from

long
and
not
weedy
in
the
muzzle
nor
thick
and
coarse
in
the

but
tapering
down
and
finishing
with
a
stout
broad
muzzle
skull
should
be
flat
and
moderately
broad
between
the
ears
which
are
rather
small

well
covered
with

ears
should
lie
close
to
the
side
of
the
head
but
not
dead
in
their
carriage
face
the
face
should
be
smooth
and
any
indication
of
a

should
be
penalised
eye
the
eye
should
in
all
cases
be
dark
and
not
too
deeply

placed
in
the
shoulders

nicely
arched
of
moderate
length
and
yet
powerful
and
free
from

shoulders
well
laid
back
and
as
free
from
massiveness
as
possible
though
there
is
a
decided
tendency
in
this
variety
to
such
a
fault
legs
straight
and
well
covered
with
coat
the
bone
should
show
quality
and
yet
be
fairly
abundant
feet
compact

should
show
great
power
with
deep
ribs
as
little
in
the
flank
as
possible
tail
strong
at
the
base
set
on
in
a
line
with
the
back
and
tapering
to
a
point
the
size
of
the
curls
upon
it
diminishing
gradually
to
the
end
should
show
great
development
of
muscle
with
bent

being
strong
and
the
hind
feet
compact
any
suspicion
of

hocks
should
be
heavily
penalised
colour
mostly
a
dull
black
some
dogs
are
seen
with
very
good
coats
and
bodies
but
their
heads
are
generally
thick
and
coarse
and
the
colour
of
their
eyes
does
not
always
match
as
it
should
do
with
the
colour
of
the
coat
a
few
dogs
of
this
colour
have
achieved
distinction
on
the
show
bench
the
labrador
within
recent
years
the
original
labrador
dog
has
taken
its
place
as
a
recognised
variety
of
the
retriever
and
become
prominent
both
at
exhibitions
and
as
a
worker
it
is
not
probable
that
any
have
been
imported
into
england
for
the
past
quarter
of
a
century
but
without
the
assistance
of
shows
or
imported
blood
they
have
survived
marvellously
thanks
especially
to
the
kennels
of
such
breeders
as
the
dukes
of
buccleuch
and
hamilton
the
earl
of

lords
wimborne
horne
and

kennel
we
are
probably
more
indebted
in
the
last
twenty
years
than
to
any
other
its

laid
in
two
bitches
by
a
dog
of
the
duke
of
hamilton
from
a
bitch
of
lord
malmesbury
at
drumlanrig
as
well
as
on
the

other
estates
they
have
been
most
particular
in
preserving
the
purity
and
working
qualities
of
their
strain
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the

have
been
responsible
for
some
of
the
best
field
trial
winners
of
the
present
day
as
far
as
looks
are
concerned
one
can
not
say
that
the
labrador
compares
favourably
with
either
the
flat
or
the
curly
coated
retriever

that
is
immaterial

at

the

i
the
spaniel
the
spaniel
family
is
without
any
doubt
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
many
groups
which
are
included
in
the
canine
race
not
only
on
account
of
its
undoubted
antiquity
and
compared
with
other
families
its
well
authenticated
lineage
but
also
because
of
its
many
branches
and
subdivisions
ranging
in
size
from
the
majestic
and
massive
clumbers
to
the
diminutive
toys
which
we
are
accustomed
to
associate
with
fair
ladies
laps
and
pens
at
our
big
dog
shows
moreover
the
different
varieties
of
setters
undoubtedly
derive
their
origin
from
the
same
parent
stock
since
we
find
them
described
by
the
earlier
sporting
writers
as
setting
or
crouching
spaniels
in
contradistinction
to
the
finding
or
springing
spaniel
who
flushed
the
game
he
found
without
setting
or
pointing
it
as
time
went
on
the
setting
variety
was
no
doubt
bred
larger
and
longer
in
the
leg
with
a
view
to
increased
pace
but
the
head
and
coat
still
remain
to
prove
the
near
connection
between
the
two
breeds
all
the
different
varieties
of
spaniels
both
sporting
and
toy
have
with
the
exception
of
the
clumber
and
the
irish
water
spaniel
who
is
not
despite
his
name
a
true
spaniel
at
all
a
common
origin
though
at
a
very
early
date
we
find
them
divided
into
two
groups
land
and
water
spaniels
and
these
two
were
kept
distinct
and
bred
to
develop
those
points
which
were
most
essential
for
their
different
spheres
of
work
the
earliest
mention
of
spaniels
to
be
found
in
english
literature
is
contained
in
the
celebrated
master
of
game
the
work
of
edward
plantagenet
second
duke
of
york
and
master
of
game
to
his
uncle
henry
to
whom
the
work
is
dedicated
it
was
written
between
the
years
and
and
although
none
of
the
of
which
some
sixteen
are
in
existence
is
dated
this
date
can
be
fairly
accurately
fixed
as
the
author
was
appointed
master
of
game
in
the
former
and
killed
at
agincourt
in
the
latter
year
his
chapter
on
spaniels
however
is
mainly
a
translation
from
the
equally
celebrated
livre
de
chasse
of
gaston
comte
de
foix
generally
known
as
gaston
phoebus
which
was
written
in
so
that
we
may
safely
assume
that
spaniels
were
well
known
and
habitually
used
as
aids
to
the
chase
both
in
france
and
england
as
early
as
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
in
the
eighteenth
and
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
spaniel
was
described
by
many
writers
on
sporting
subjects
but
there
is
a
great
similarity
in
most
of
these
accounts
each
author
apparently
having
been
content
to
repeat
in
almost
identical
language
what
had
been
said
upon
the
subject
by
his
predecessors
without
importing
any
originality
or
opinions
of
his
own
many
of
these
works
notwithstanding
this
defect
are
very
interesting
to
the
student
of
spaniel
lore
and
the
perusal
of
blaine
dictionary
and
rural
scott
and
needham
can
be
recommended
to
all
who
wish
to
study
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
various
modern
breeds
the
works
of
the
french
writers
de
cominck
de
cherville
blaze
and
megnin
are
well
worth
reading
while
of
late
years
the
subject
has
been
treated
very
fully
by
such
british
writers
as
the
late
walsh
stonehenge
vero
shaw
rawdon
lee
colonel
claude
cane
and
phillips
nearly
all
of
the
early
writers
both
french
and
english
are
agreed
that
the
breed
came
originally
from
spain
and
we
may
assume
that
such
early
authorities
as
gaston
phoebus
edward
plantagenet
and
caius
had
good
reasons
for
telling
us
that
these
dogs
were
called
spaniels
because
they
came
from
spain
the
following
distinct
breeds
or
varieties
are
recognised
by
the
kennel
club
irish
water
spaniels
water
spaniels
other
than
irish
clumber
spaniels
sussex
spaniels
field
spaniels
english
springers
welsh
springers
cocker
spaniels
each
of
these
varieties
differs
considerably
from
the
others
and
each
has
its
own
special
advocates
and
admirers
as
well
as
its
own
particular
sphere
of
work
for
which
it
is
best
fitted
though
almost
any
spaniel
can
be
made
into
a
general
utility
dog
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
popularity
of
the
breed
ii
the
irish
water
there
is
only
one
breed
of
dog
known
in
these
days
by
the
name
of
irish
water
spaniel
but
if
we
are
to
trust
the
writers
of
no
longer
ago
than
half
a
century
there
were
at
one
time
two
if
not
three
breeds
of
water
spaniels
peculiar
to
the
emerald
isle
these
were
the
tweed
water
spaniel
the
northern
water
spaniel
and
the
southern
water
spaniel
the
last
of
these
being
the
progenitors
of
our
modern
strains
the
history
of
the
irish
water
spaniel
is
in
many
ways
a
very
extraordinary
one
according
to
the
claim
of
justin
mccarthy
it
originated
entirely
in
his
kennels
and
this
claim
has
never
been
seriously
disputed
by
the
subsequent
owners
and
breeders
of
these
dogs
it
seems
improbable
that
justin
mccarthy
can
actually
have
originated
or
manufactured
a
breed
possessing
so
many
extremely
marked
differences
and
divergences
of
type
as
the
irish
water
spaniel
but
what
he
probably
did
was
to
rescue
an
old
and
moribund
breed
from
impending
extinction
and
so
improve
it
by
judicious
breeding
and
as
to
give
it
a
new
lease
of
life
and
permanently
fix
its
salient
points
and
characteristics
however
that
may
be
little
seems
to
have
been
known
of
the
breed
before
he
took
it
in
hand
and
it
is
very
certain
that
nearly
every
irish
water
spaniel
seen
for
the
last
half
century
owes
its
descent
to
his
old
dog
boatswain
who
was
born
in
and
lived
for
eighteen
years
he
must
have
been
a
grand
old
dog
since
mccarthy
gave
him
to
joliffe
tuffnell
in
when
he
was
fifteen
years
old
and
his
new
owner
subsequently
bred
by
him
jack
a
dog
whose
name
appears
in
many
pedigrees
it
was
not
until
that
the
breed
seems
to
have
attracted
much
notice
in
england
but
in
that
year
the
birmingham
committee
gave
two
classes
for
them
in
which
however
several
of
the
prizes
were
withheld
for
want
of
merit
the
next
few
years
saw
these
dogs
making
great
strides
in
popularity
and
classes
being
provided
at
most
of
the
important
shows
many
good
specimens
were
exhibited
during
the
last
few
years
however
the
breed
seems
to
have
been
progressing
the
wrong
way
and
classes
at
shows
have
not
been
nearly
so
strong
either
in
numbers
or
in
quality
as
they
used
to
be
yet
there
have
been
and
are
still
quite
a
large
number
of
good
dogs
and
bitches
to
be
seen
and
it
only
needs
enthusiasm
and
among
breeders
to
bring
back
the
palmiest
days
of
the
irish
water
spaniel
there
is
no
member
of
the
whole
canine
family
which
has
a
more
distinctive
personal
appearance
than
the
irish
water
spaniel
with
him
it
is
a
case
of
once
seen
never
forgotten
and
no
one
who
has
ever
seen
one
could
possibly
mistake
him
for
anything
else
than
what
he
is
his
best
friends
probably
would
not
claim
beauty
in
the
aesthetic
sense
for
him
but
he
is
attractive
in
a
quaint
way
peculiarly
his
own
and
in
this
particular
his
looks
do
not
bewray
him
he
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
all
the
dogs
used
in
aid
of
the
gun
and
in
his
own
sphere
one
of
the
most
useful
that
sphere
there
is
no
doubt
is
that
indicated
by
his
name
and
it
is
in
a
country
of
bogs
and
marshes
like
the
south
and
west
of
ireland
of
which
he
was
originally
a
native
where
snipe
and
wildfowl
provide
the
staple
sport
of
the
gunner
that
he
is
in
his
element
and
seen
at
his
best
though
no
doubt
he
can
do
excellent
work
as
an
ordinary
retriever
and
is
often
used
as
such
but
nature
or
mccarthy
art
has
specially
formed
and
endowed
him
for
the
amphibious
sport
indicated
above
and
has
provided
him
with
an
excellent
nose
an
almost
waterproof
coat
the
sporting
instincts
of
a
true
son
of
erin
and
above
all
a
disposition
full
of
good
sense
he
is
and
at
the
same
time
adaptable
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
in
training
his
detractors
often
accuse
him
of
being
but
this
charge
is
not
well
founded
many
a
dog
which
is
used
to
hunt
or
find
game
as
well
as
to
retrieve
it
will
often
kill
a
wounded
bird
or
rabbit
rather
than
allow
it
to
escape
while
there
are
many
irish
water
spaniels
who
under
normal
circumstances
are
just
as
as
the
most
fashionable
of
black
retrievers
besides
his
virtues
in
the
field
the
irish
water
spaniel
has
the
reputation
a
very
one
of
being
the
best
of
pals
most
people
are
well
acquainted
with
the
personal
appearance
of
this
dog
the
points
regarded
as
essential
are
as
follows
colour
the
colour
should
always
be
a
rich
dark
liver
or
puce
without
any
white
at
all
any
white
except
the
slightest
of
shirt
fronts
should
disqualify
the
of
course
should
conform
to
the
coat
in
colour
and
be
dark
brown
head
the
head
should
have
a
capacious
skull
fairly
but
not
excessively
domed
with
plenty
of
brain
room
it
should
be
surmounted
with
a
regular
topknot
of
curly
hair
a
and
distinctive
point
this
topknot
should
be
square
cut
or
like
a
poodle
wig
but
should
grow
down
to
a
well
defined
point
between
the
eyes

the
eyes
should
be

should
be
long

leather
low
set
heavily
ringleted
and
from
to
inches
long
according
to
size
muzzle
and
jaw
the
muzzle
and
jaw
should
be
long
and
strong
there
should
be
a
decided
stop
but
not
so
pronounced
as
to
make
the
brows
or
forehead
prominent
neck
the
neck
should
be
fairly
long
and
very
muscular

the
shoulders
should
be
sloping
most
irish
water
spaniels
have
bad
straight
shoulders
a
defect
which
should
be
bred
out
chest
the
chest
is
deep
and
usually
rather
narrow
but
should
not
be
so
narrow
as
to
constrict
the
heart
and
lungs
back
and
loins
the
back
and

strong
and
arched
the
straight

should
be

feet
the
feet

and
rather
spreading
as
is
proper
for
a
water
dog
well
clothed
with
hair

the
stern
covered
with
the
shortest
of
hair
except
for
the
first
couple
of
inches
next
the
buttocks
whiplike

stinglike
a
most
important
point

the

of
short

like
a
poodle
and
very
dense
if
left
to
itself
this
coat
mats
or
cords
but
this
is
not
permissible
in
show
dogs
the
hair
on
the
muzzle
and
forehead
below
the
topknot
is
quite
short
and
smooth
as
well
as
that

appearance
is
not
remarkable
for

intelligent
looking

the
height
should
be
between

iii
the
english
water
in
the
kennel
club
register
of
breeds
no
place
is
allotted
to
this
variety
all
water
spaniels
other
than
irish
being
classed
together
despite
this
absence
of
official
recognition
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
a
breed
of
spaniels
legitimately
entitled
to
the
designation
of
english
water
spaniels
has
been
in
existence
for
many
years
in
all
probability
a
descendant
of
the
old
an
animal
closely
resembling
the
french
barbet
the
ancestor
of
the
modern
poodle
they
were
even
trimmed
at
times
much
in
the
same
way
as
a
poodle
is
nowadays
as
markham
gives
precise
directions
for
the
cutting
or
shearing
him
from
the
nauill
downeward
or
backeward
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
writer
of
sportsman
is
that
the
breed
originated
from
a
cross
between
the
large
water
dog
and
the
springing
spaniel
and
this
is
probably
correct
though
youatt
a
notable
authority
thinks
that
the
cross
was
with
an
english
setter
possibly
some
strains
may
have
been
established
in
this
way
and
not
differ
very
much
in
make
and
shape
from
those
obtained
from
the
cross
with
the
spaniel
as
it
is
well
known
that
setters
and
spaniels
have
a
common
origin
in
general
appearance
the
dog
resembles
somewhat
closely
the
springer
except
that
he
may
be
somewhat
higher
on
the
leg
and
that
his
coat
should
consist
of
crisp
tight
curls
almost
like
astrakhan
fur
everywhere
except
on
his
face
where
it
should
be
short
there
should
be
no
topknot
like
that
of
the
irish
water
spaniel
iv
the
clumber
spaniel
is
in
high
favour
in
the
spaniel
world
both
with
shooting
men
and
exhibitors
and
the
breed
well
deserves
from
both
points
of
view
the
position
which
it
occupies
in
the
public
esteem
no
other
variety
is
better
equipped
mentally
and
physically
for
the
work
it
is
called
upon
to
do
in
aid
of
the
gun
and
few
certainly
none
of
the
spaniels
surpass
or
even
equal
it
in
appearance
as
a
sporting
dog
the
clumber
is
possessed
of
the
very
best
of
noses
a
natural
inclination
both
to
hunt
his
game
and
retrieve
it
when
killed
great
keenness
and
perseverance
wonderful
endurance
and
activity
considering
his
massive
build
and
as
a
rule
is
very
easy
to
train
being
highly
intelligent
and
more
docile
and
biddable
the
man
who
owns
a
good
dog
of
this
breed
whether
he
uses
it
as
a
retriever
for
driven
birds
works
it
in
a
team
or
uses
it
as
his
sole
companion
when
he
goes
gunning
possesses
a
treasure
the
great
success
of
these
spaniels
in
the
field
trials
promoted
by
both
the
societies
which
foster
those
most
useful
institutions
is
enough
to
prove
this
and
more
convincing
still
is
the
tenacity
with
which
the
fortunate
possessors
of
old
strains
mostly
residents
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
original
home
of
the
breed
have
held
on
to
them
and
continued
to
breed
and
use
them
year
after
year
for
many
generations
as
a
show
dog
his
massive
frame
powerful
limbs
pure
white
coat
with
its
pale
lemon
markings
and
frecklings
and
above
all
his
solemn
and
majestic
aspect
mark
him
out
as
a
true
aristocrat
with
all
the
beauty
of
refinement
which
comes
from
a
long
line
of
cultured
ancestors
all
research
so
far
has
failed
to
carry
their
history
back
any
further
than
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
about
that
time
the
duc
de
noailles
presented
some
spaniels
probably
his
whole
kennel
which
he
brought
from
france
to
the
second
duke
of
newcastle
from
whose
place
clumber
park
the
breed
has
taken
its
name
beyond
this
it
seems
impossible
to
go
indeed
the
clumber
seems
to
be
generally
looked
upon
as
a
purely
english
breed
from
clumber
park
specimens
found
their
way
to
most
of
the
other
great
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
notably
to
althorp
park
welbeck
abbey
birdsall
house
thoresby
hall
and
osberton
hall
it
is
from
the
kennels
at
the
place
owned
by
foljambe
that
most
of
the
progenitors
of
the
clumbers
which
have
earned
notoriety
derived
their
origin
nearly
all
the
most
famous
show
winners
of
early
days
were
descended
from
foljambe
dogs
and
his
beau
may
perhaps
be
considered
one
of
the
most
important
pillars
of
the
stud
as
he
was
the
sire
of
nabob
a
great
and
considered
one
of
the
best
of
his
day
who
belonged
at
various
times
during
his
career
to
such
famous

and

there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
lamentation
lately
among
old
breeders
and
exhibitors
about
the
decadence
of
the
breed
and
the
loss
of
the
true
old
type
possessed
by
these
dogs
but
despite
all
they
can
say
to
the
contrary
the
clumber
is
now
in
a
more
flourishing
state
than
it
ever
has
been
and
although
perhaps
we
have
not
now
nor
have
had
for
the
last
decade
a
john
o
gaunt
or
a
tower
there
have
been
a
large
number
of
dogs
shown
during
that
time
who
possessed
considerable
merit
and
would
probably
have
held
their
own
even
in
the
days
of
these
bygone
heroes
some
of
the
most
notable
have
been
baillie
friar
beechgrove
donally
goring
of
auchentorlie
hempstead
toby
and
preston
shot
who
all
earned
the
coveted
title
of
champion
the
field
trials
have
no
doubt
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
largely
augmented
popularity
of
the
breed
and
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
those
who
own
clumbers
for
the
first
two
or
three
years
after
these
were
truly
established
no
other
breed
seemed
to
have
a
chance
with
them
and
even
now
though
both
english
and
welsh
springers
have
done
remarkably
well
they
more
than
hold
their
own
the
most
distinguished
performer
by
far
was
winton
beechgrove
bee
a
bitch
whose
work
was
practically
faultless
and
the
first
field
trial
champion
among
spaniels
other
good
clumbers
who
earned

in

this
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
distinct
breeds
of
land
spaniels
now
existing
in
the
british
islands
and
probably
also
the
purest
in
point
of
descent
since
it
has
for
many
years
past
been
confined
to
a
comparatively
small
number
of
kennels
the
owners
of
which
have
always
been
at
considerable
pains
to
keep
their
strains
free
from
any
admixture
of
foreign
blood
the
modern
race
of
sussex
spaniels
as
we
know
it
owes
its
origin
in
the
main
to
the
kennel
kept
by
fuller
at
rosehill
park
brightling
near
hastings
this
gentleman
who
died
in
is
said
to
have
kept
his
strain
for
fifty
years
or
more
and
to
have
shot
over
them
almost
daily
during
the
season
but
at
his
death
they
were
dispersed
by
auction
and
none
of
them
can
be
traced
with
any
accuracy
except
a
dog
and
a
bitch
which
were
given
at
the
time
to
relf
the
head
keeper
relf
survived
his
master
for
forty
years
and
kept
up
his
interest
in
the
breed
to
the
last
he
used
to
say
that
the
golden
tinge
peculiar
to
the
rosehill
breed
came
from
a
bitch
which
had
been
mated
with
a
dog
belonging
to
watts
of
battle
and
that
every
now
and
then
what
he
termed
a
sandy
pup
would
turn
up
in
her
litters
owing
to
an
outbreak
of
dumb
madness
in
the
rosehill
kennels
a
very
large
number
of
its
occupants
either
died
or
had
to
be
destroyed
and
this
no
doubt
accounted
for
the
extreme
scarcity
of
the
breed
when
several
enthusiasts
began
to
revive
it
about
the
year
saxby
and
marchant
are
said
to
have
had
the
same
strain
as
that
at
rosehill
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
famous
sires
who
is
to
be
found
in
most
sussex
pedigrees
was
buckingham
by
rover
out
of
saxby
fan
it
was
from
the
union
of
buckingham
who
was
claimed
to
be
pure
rosehill
with
bebb
daughter
peggie
that
the
great
bachelor
resulted
a
dog
whose
name
is
to
be
found
in
almost
every
pedigree
though
campbell
newington
strain
to
which
has
descended
the
historic
prefix
rosehill
contains
less
of
this
blood
than
any
other
about
jacobs
of
newton
abbot
took
up
this
breed
with
great
success
owning
amongst
other
good
specimens
russett
dolly
brunette
and
bachelor
the
latter
a
dog
whose
services
at
the
stud
can
not
be
estimated
too
highly
when
this
kennel
was
broken
up
in
the
best
of
the
sussex
spaniels
were
acquired
by
woolland
and
from
that
date
this
gentleman
kennel
carried
all
before
it
until
it
in
turn
was
broken
up
and
dispersed
in
so
successful
was
woolland
that
one
may
almost
say
that
he
beat
all
other
competitors
off
the
field
though
one
of
them
campbell
newington
stuck
most
gallantly
to
him
all
through
campbell
newington
has
been
breeding
sussex
spaniels
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
with
an
enthusiasm
and
tenacity
worthy
of
the
warmest
admiration
and
his
strain
is
probably
the
purest
and
more
full
of
the
original
blood
than
any
other
his
kennel
has
always
maintained
a
very
high
standard
of
excellence
and
many
famous
show
specimens
have
come
from
it
notably
rosehill
ruler
ii
a
splendid
sussex
scarcely
inferior
to
bridford
giddie
romulus
roein
rita
rush
rock
rag
and
ranji
and
many
others
of
almost
equal
merit
colonel
claude
cane
kennel
of
sussex
started
from
a
foundation
has
been
going
for
some
seventeen
years
the
best
he
has
shown
being
jonathan
swift
celbridge
eldorado
and
celbridge
chrysolite
the
breed
has
always
had
a
good
character
for
work
and
most
of
the
older
writers
who
mention
them
speak
of
sussex
spaniels
in
very
eulogistic
terms
they
are
rather
slow
workers
but
thoroughly
conscientious
and
painstaking
and
are
not
afraid
of
any
amount
of
thick
covert
through
which
they
will
force
their
way
and
seldom
leave
anything
behind
them
a
sussex
spaniel
is
a
very
handsome
dog
indeed
his
beautiful
colour
alone
is
enough
to
make
his
appearance
an
attractive
one
even
if
he
were
unsymmetrical
and
ungainly
in
his
proportions
this
colour
known
as
golden
liver
is
peculiar
to
the
breed
and
is
the
great
touchstone
and
of
purity
of
blood
no
other
dog
has
exactly
the
same
shade
of
coat
which
the
word
liver
hardly
describes
exactly
as
it
is
totally
different
from
the
ordinary
liver
colour
of
an
irishman
a
pointer
or
even
a
liver
field
spaniel
it
is
rather
a
golden
chestnut
with
a
regular
metallic
sheen
as
of
burnished
metal
showing
more
especially
on
the
head
and
face
and
everywhere
where
the
hair
is
short
this
is
very
apparent
when
a
dog
gets
his
new
coat
in
time
of
course
it
is
liable
to
get
somewhat
bleached
by
sun
and
weather
when
it
turns
almost
yellow
every
expert
knows
this
colour
well
and
looks
for
it
at
once
when
judging
a
class
of
sussex
the
description
of
the
breed
given
by
the
spaniel
club
is
as
follows
head
the

not

apparently
shorter
than
the

be

so
as
to
give
a
settery
appearance
which
is
so
objectionable
the
should
be
well
feathered
above
the

but
should
not
have
much
hair
below
that
point
the

the
field
the
modern
field
spaniel
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
indeed
we
may
almost
say
at
this
stage
of
canine
history
two
breeds
as
for
several
years
past
there
has
not
been
very
much
intermingling
of
blood
between
the
blacks
and
those
known
by
the
awkward
designation
of
any
other
variety
though
of
course
all
came
originally
from
the
same
parent
stock
the
black
members
of
the
family
have
always
been
given
the
pride
of
place
and
accounted
of
most
importance
though
latterly
their
brethren
seem
to
have
rather
overtaken
them
among
the
really
old
writers
there
is
one
mention
and
one
only
of
spaniels
of
a
black
colour
arcussia
speaks
of
them
and
of
their
being
used
in
connection
with
the
sport
of
hawking
but
from
his
time
up
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
though
many
colours
are
spoken
of
as
being
appropriate
to
the
various
breeds
of
spaniels
no
author
mentions
black
the
first
strain
of
blacks
of
which
we
know
much
belonged
to
burdett
and
was
obtained
from
a
footman
of
lutterworth
leicestershire
who
was
supposed
to
have
owned
them
for
some
time
burdett
bob
and
frank
may
be
found
at
the
head
of
very
many
of
the
best
pedigrees
at
his
death
most
of
his
spaniels
became
the
property
of
jones
of
oscott
and
phineas
bullock
of
bilston
the
latter
of
whom
was
most
extraordinarily
successful
and
owned
a
kennel
of
field
spaniels
which
was
practically
unbeatable
between
the
dates
of
the
first
birmingham
show
in
and
the
publication
of
the
first
volume
of
the
kennel
club
stud
book
in
many
if
not
most
of
the
dogs
which
won
for
other
owners
having
been
bred
by
him
his
nellie
and
bob
who
won
the
chief
prizes
year
after
year
at
all
the
leading
shows
were
probably
the
two
best
specimens
of
their
day
another
most
successful
breeder
was
boulton
of
beverley
whose
kennel
produced
many
celebrated
dogs
including
beverlac
said
to
be
the
largest
field
spaniel
ever
exhibited
and
rolf
whose
union
with
belle
produced
four
bitches
who
were
destined
when
mated
with
nigger
a
dog
of
bullock
breeding
to
form
the
foundation
of
the
equally
if
not
more
famous
kennel
belonging
to
jacobs
of
newton
abbot
it
was
jacobs
who
by
judiciously
mating
his
sussex
sires
bachelor
bachelor
and
others
with
these
bitches
established
the
strain
which
in
his
hands
and
in
those
of
his
successors
captain
thomas
and
moses
woolland
carried
all
before
it
for
many
years
and
is
still
easily
at
the
top
of
the
tree
being
the
most
sought
for
and
highly
prized
of
all
on
account
of
its
quality
if
black
spaniels
are
not
quite
so
popular
at
present
as
they
were
some
years
ago
the
fault
lies
with
those
breeders
exhibitors
and
judges
the
latter
being
most
to
blame
who
encouraged
the
absurd
craze
for
excessive
length
of
body
and
shortness
of
leg
which
not
very
long
ago
threatened
to
transform
the
whole
breed
into
a
race
of
cripples
and
to
bring
it
into
contempt
and
derision
among
all
practical
men
no
breed
or
variety
of
dog
has
suffered
more
from
the
injudicious
fads
and
crazes
of
those
showmen
who
are
not
sportsmen
also
at
one
time
among
a
certain
class
of
judges
length
and
lowness
was
everything
and
soundness
activity
and
symmetry
simply
did
not
count
as
happens
to
all
absurd
crazes
of
this
kind
when
carried
to
exaggeration
public
opinion
has
proved
too
much
for
it
but
not
before
a
great
deal
of
harm
has
been
done
to
a
breed
which
is
certainly
ornamental
and
can
be
most
useful
as
well
most
of
the
of
the
present
day
are
sound
useful
dogs
capable
of
work
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
judges
will
combine
to
keep
them
so
the
coloured
field
spaniel
has
now
almost
invariably
at
the
principal
shows
special
classes
allotted
to
him
and
does
not
have
to
compete
against
his
black
brother
as
used
to
be
the
case
in
former
years
the
systematic
attempt
to
breed
spaniels
of
various
colours
with
a
groundwork
of
white
does
not
date
back
much
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
the
greater
part
of
the
credit
for
producing
this
variety
may
be
given
to
three
gentlemen
schofield
spurgin
and
robinson
in
the
early
days
of
breeding
blacks
when
the
bitches
were
mated
either
with
sussex
or
liver
and
white
springers
or
norfolk
spaniels
many
puppies
necessarily
occurred
which
most
breeders
destroyed
but
it
occurred
to
some
of
these
gentlemen
that
a
handsome
and
distinct
variety
might
be
obtained
by
careful
selection
and
they
have
certainly
succeeded
to
a
very
great
extent
the
most
famous
names
among
the
early
sires
are
spurgin
alonzo
and
his
son
fop
and
robinson
alva
dash
from
one
or
other
of
whom
nearly
all
the
modern
celebrities
derive
their
descent
those
who
have
been
and
are
interested
in
promoting
and
breeding
these
variety
spaniels
deserve
a
large
amount
of
credit
for
their
perseverance
which
has
been
attended
with
the
greatest
success
so
far
as
producing
colour
goes
no
doubt
there
is
a
very
great
fascination
in
breeding
for
colour
and
in
doing
so
there
is
no
royal
road
to
success
which
can
only
be
attained
by
the
exercise
of
the
greatest
skill
and
the
nicest
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
breeding
stock
at
the
same
time
colour
is
not
everything
and
type
and
working
qualities
should
never
be
sacrificed
to
it
this
has
too
often
been
done
in
the
case
of
coloured
field
spaniels
there
are
plenty
of
beautiful
blue
roans
red
roans
and
tricolours
whether
blue
roan
and
tan
or
liver
roan
and
tan
but
nearly
all
of
them
are
either
cocktailed
weak
in
or
and
showing
far
too
much
haw
in
fact
in
head
and
front
the
greater
number
of
the
tricolours
remind
one
of
the
almost
as
much
as
they
do
in
colour
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
will
endeavour
to
get
back
the
true
spaniel
type
before
it
is
too
late
the
points
of
both
black
and
coloured
field
spaniels
are
identical
bar
colour
and
here
it
must
be
said
that
black
and
tan
liver
and
tan
and
liver
are
not
considered
true
variety
colours
though
of
course
they
have
to
compete
in
those
classes
but
rather
sports
from
black
the
colours
aimed
at
by
variety

vii
the
english
it
is
only
quite
recently
that
the
kennel
club
has
officially
recognised
the
variety
known
by
the
name
at
the
head
of
this
section
for
a
long
time
the
liver
and
white
or
black
spaniels
longer
in
the
leg
than
either
sussex
or
field
spaniels
had
been
known
as
norfolk
spaniels
and
under
this
title
the
spaniel
club
has
published
a
description
of
them
there
had
however
been
a
considerable
amount
of
discussion
about
the
propriety
of
this
name
of
norfolk
and
the
weight
of
the
evidence
adduced
went
to
show
that
as
far
as
any
territorial
connection
with
the
county
of
that
name
went
it
was
a
misnomer
and
that
it
probably
arose
from
the
breed
having
been
kept
by
one
of
the
dukes
of
norfolk
most
likely
that
one
quoted
by
blaine
in
his
who
was
so
jealous
of
his
strain
that
it
was
only
on
the
expressly
stipulated
condition
that
they
were
not
to
be
allowed
to
breed
in
the
direct
line
that
he
would
allow
one
to
leave
his
kennels
but
when
this
old
breed
was
taken
up
by
the
sporting
spaniel
society
they
decided
to
drop
the
name
of
norfolk
and
to
revert
to
the
old
title
of
springer
not
perhaps
a
very
happy
choice
as
all
spaniels
are
properly
speaking
springers
in
contradistinction
to
setters
the
complete
official
designation
on
the
kennel
register
is
english
springers
other
than
clumbers
sussex
and
field
a
very
clumsy
name
for
a
breed
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
variety
of
spaniel
retains
more
resemblance
to
the
old
strains
which
belonged
to
our
forefathers
before
the
long
and
low
idea
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
exhibitors
and
it
was
certainly
well
worth
preserving
the
only
way
nowadays
by
which
uniformity
of
type
can
be
obtained
is
by
somebody
having
authority
drawing
up
a
standard
and
scale
of
points
for
breeders
to
go
by
and
the
sporting
spaniel
society
are
to
be
commended
for
having
done
this
for
the
breed
under
notice
the
fruit
of
their
action
being
already
apparent
in
the
larger
and
more
uniform
classes
to
be
seen
at
shows
as
the
officially
recognised
life
of
the
breed
has
been
such
a
short
one
there
are
naturally
not
very
many
names
of
note
among
the
the
principal
breeders
and
owners
have
so
far
been
arkwright
harry
jones
sir
hugo
fitzherbert
bethune
eversfield
and
winton
smith
they
are
undoubtedly
the
right
dogs
for
those
who
want
spaniels
to
travel
faster
and
cover
more
ground
than
the
more
ponderous
and
clumbers
sussex
or
field
spaniels
do
but
their
work
is
hardly
equal
in
finish
and
precision
to
that
of
either
of
the
two
former
breeds

the
welsh
like
the
english
springer
the
welsh
springer
has
only
very
recently
come
into
existence
officially
that
is
to
say
but
his
admirers
claim
for
him
that
he
has
existed
as
a
separate
breed
for
a
long
time
though
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
principality
where
he
is
referred
to
as
the
starter
when
his
claims
were
first
put
forward
they
were
vigorously
contested
by
many
who
could
claim
to
speak
and
write
with
authority
upon
the
various
breeds
of
spaniels
existing
in
these
islands
and
it
was
freely
asserted
that
they
were
nothing
but
crossbreds
between
the
ordinary
springer
and
probably
a
clumber
in
order
to
account
for
the
red
or
orange
markings
and
the
ears
even
if
they
are
a
new
breed
they
are
a
most
meritorious
one
both
in
their
appearance
which
is
eminently
sporting
and
workmanlike
and
for
the
excellence
of
their
work
in
the
field
which
has
been
amply
demonstrated
by
the
record
earned
at
the
field
trials
by
williams
and
others
but
those
who
have
seen
them
at
work
have
nothing
but
good
to
say
of
them
and
for
working
large
rough
tracts
of
country
in
teams
their
admirers
say
they
are
unequalled
in
appearance
they
are
decidedly
attractive
rather
more
lightly
built
than
most
spaniels
small
in

indeed
very
little

invariably

fine

with

ix
the
cocker
for
the
last
few
years
the
popularity
of
this
smaller
sized
branch
of
the
spaniel
tribe
has
been
steadily
increasing
and
the
cocker
classes
at
most
of
the
best
shows
are
now
remarkable
both
for
the
number
of
entries
and
the
very
high
standard
of
excellence
to
which
they
attain
a
short
time
ago
black
cockers
were
decidedly
more
fashionable
than
their
relatives
but
now
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
the
various
roans
and
tricolours
have
overtaken
and
passed
the
others
both
in
general
quality
and
in
the
public
esteem
the
reason
for
this
popularity
of
the
breed
as
a
whole
is
not
far
to
seek
the
affectionate
and
merry
disposition
of
the
cocker
and
his
small
size
compared
with
that
of
the
other
breeds
fit
him
for
a
companion
in
the
house
as
well
as
in
the
field
and
he
ranks
among
his
admirers
quite
as
many
of
the
fairer
sex
as
he
does
men
a
fact
which
is
not
without
a
certain
element
of
danger
since
it
should
never
be
lost
sight
of
that
the
breed
is
a
sporting
one
which
should
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
degenerate
into
a
race
of
mere
house
companions
or
toys
spaniels
usually
called
cockers
from
their
being
more
especially
used
in
woodcock
shooting
have
been
indigenous
to
wales
and
devonshire
for
many
years
and
it
is
most
likely
from
one
or
both
of
these
sources
that
the
modern
type
has
been
evolved
it
is
probable
too
that
the
type
in
favour
of
a
short
coupled
rather
cobby
dog
fairly
high
on
the
leg
is
more
like
that
of
these
cockers
than
that
which
obtained
a
decade
or
two
ago
when
they
were
scarcely
recognised
as
a
separate
breed
and
the
spaniel
classes
were
usually
divided
into
field
spaniels
over
lb
and
field
spaniels
under
lb
in
those
days
a
large
proportion
of
the
prizes
fell
to
miniature
field
spaniels
the
breed
was
not
given
official
recognition
on
the
kennel
club
register
till
nor
a
section
to
itself
in
the
stud
book
and
up
to
that
date
the
only
real
qualification
a
dog
required
to
be
enabled
to
compete
as
a
cocker
was
that
he
should
be
under
the
weight
of
a
limit
arbitrarily
and
somewhat
irrationally
fixed
since
in
the
case
of
an
animal
just
on
the
he
might
very
well
have
been
a
cocker
before
and
a
field
spaniel
after
breakfast
it
is
not
easy
to
find
authentic
pedigrees
going
back
further
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
but
phillips
can
trace
his
own
strain
back
to
and
james
farrow
was
exhibiting
successfully
years
ago
the
former
gentleman
published
the
pedigree
of
his
bitch
rivington
dora
for
eighteen
generations
in
sporting
while
the
famous
obo
strain
of
the
latter
may
be
said
to
have
exercised
more
influence
than
any
other
on
the
black
variety
both
in
this
country
and
in
the
united
states

was

most
famous

before

won
the
highest
honours
that
the
show
bench
can
give
and
the
importance
of
his
service
to
the
breed
both
in
his
owner
kennel
and
outside
it
can
scarcely
be
nearly
all
of
the
best
blacks
and
many
of
the
best
coloured
cockers
are
descended
from
him
at
this
period
the
type
mostly
favoured
was
that
of
a
dog
rather
longer
in
the
body
and
lower
on
the
leg
than
it
is
at
present
but
the
obo
family
marked
a
progressive
step
and
very
rightly
kept
on
winning
under
all
the
best
judges
for
many
years
their

to

to
get

several

quite

in

and
in
the
field
coloured
cockers
are
certainly
booming
just
now
and
as
a
consequence
the
blacks
who
are
equally
worthy
of
support
are
being
rather
neglected
certainly
it
is
the
case
that
whereas
one
sees
at
most
shows
big
classes
of
the
former
filled
with
a
good
level
lot
with
hardly
a
bad
specimen
amongst
them
the
classes
devoted
to
the
latter
besides
not
being
so
well
filled
are
much
more
uneven
and
always
contain
a
large
proportion
of
weeds
and
toys
a
few
years
ago
the
black
classes
were
immeasurably
superior
to
the
coloured
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
the
near
future
they
will
regain
at
least
a
position
of
equality
with
them
at
the
last
few
field
trial
meetings
the
spaniel
club
has
provided
classes
confined
to
cockers
which
have
filled
fairly
well
and
enabled
the
small
breed
to
demonstrate
that
it
can
in
its
way
be
quite
as
useful
as
its
larger
cousins
a
cocker
can
very
often
go
and
work
as
well
where
a
larger
spaniel
can
not
even
creep
and
for
working
really
thick
hedgerows
or
gorse
has
no
superior
there
seems
to
be
every
prospect
of
a
brilliant
future
and
increased
popularity
for
this
charming
breed
its
interests
are
looked
after
both
by
the
spaniel
club
and
the
comparatively
newly
formed
cocker
spaniel
club
and
it
is
also
quite
as
much
in
favour
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
as
it
is
in
the
united
kingdom

the
classes
in
america
and
canada

very
favourably

own

the

the
the
basset
was
not
familiarly
known
to
british
sportsmen
before
in
which
year
specimens
of
the
breed
were
seen
at
the
first
exhibition
of
dogs
held
in
paris
and
caused
general
curiosity
and
admiration
among
english
visitors
in
france
however
this
hound
has
been
used
for
generations
much
as
we
use
our
spaniel
as
a
finder
of
game
in
covert
and
it
has
long
been
a
popular
sporting
dog
in
russia
and
germany
in
early
times
it
was
chiefly
to
be
found
in
artois
and
flanders
where
it
is
supposed
to
have
had
its
origin
but
the
home
of
the
better
type
of
basset
is
now
chiefly
in
la
vendee
in
which
department
some
remarkably
fine
strains
have
been
produced
there
are
three
main
strains
of
the
french
basset
the
lane
the
couteulx
and
the
griffon
the
griffon
basset
is
a
hound
with
a
hard
bristly
coat
and
short
crooked
legs
it
has
never
found
great
favour
here
the
lane
hounds
are
derived
from
the
kennels
of
lane
of
franqueville
baos
and
are
also
very
little
appreciated
in
this
country
they
are
a
lemon
and
white
variety
with
or
bent
legs
the
couteulx
hounds
were
a
type
bred
up
into
a
strain
by
comte
le
couteulx
de
canteleu
they
were
tricolour
with
straight
short
legs
of
sounder
constitution
than
other
strains
with
the
make
generally
of
a
more
agile
hound
and
in
the
pedigree
of
the
best
bassets
owned
in
this
country
fifteen
years
ago
when
the
breed
was
in
considerable
demand
comte
de
couteulx
strain
was
prominent
and
always
sought
for
with
careful
selection
and
judicious
breeding
we
have
now
produced
a
beautiful
hound
of
fine
smooth
coat
and
a
rich
admixture
of
markings
with
a
head
of
noble
character
and
the
best
of
legs
and
feet
their
short
twinkling
legs
make
our
bassets
more
suitable
for
covert
hunting
than
for
hunting
hares
in
the
open
to
which
latter
purpose
they
have
frequently
been
adapted
with
some
success
their
note
is
resonant
with
wonderful
power
for
so
small
a
dog
and
in
tone
it
resembles
the
voice
of
the
bloodhound
the
is
usually
very
good
tempered
and
not
inclined
to
be
quarrelsome
with
his
kennel
mates
but
he
is
wilful
and
loves
to
roam
apart
in
search
of
game
and
is
not
very
amenable
to
discipline
when
alone
on
the
other
hand
he
works
admirably
with
his
companions
in
the
pack
when
he
is
most
painstaking
and
indefatigable
endowed
with
remarkable
powers
of
scent
he
will
hunt
a
drag
with
keen
intelligence
there
are
now
several
packs
of
bassets
kept
in
england
and
they
show
very
fair
sport
after
the
hares
but
it
is
not
their
natural
vocation
and
their
massive
build
is
against
the
possibility
of
their
becoming
popular
as
harriers
the
general
custom
is
to
follow
them
on
foot
although
occasionally
some
sportsmen
use
ponies
their
pace
however
hardly
warrants
the
latter
expedient
on
the
continent
where
big
game
is
more
common
than
with
us
the
employment
of
the
basset
is
varied
he
is
a
valuable
help
in
the
tracking
of
boar
wolf
and
deer
and
he
is
also
frequently
engaged
in
the
lighter
pastimes
of
pheasant
and
partridge
shooting
the
earl
of
onslow
and
the
late
sir
john
everett
millais
were
among
the
earliest
importers
of
the
breed
into

both
had

to
undergo
a
probationary
period
as
a
foreign
dog
in
the

at
the
principal
shows
it
was
not
until
that
a
class
was
provided
for
it
by
the
kennel
club
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
owners
of
this
beautiful
hound
are
not
more
numerous
admirable
specimens
are
still
to
be
seen
at
the
leading
exhibitions
but
the
breed
is
greatly
in
need
of
encouragement

date

the

for
some
reason
to
receive
great
attention
in

it
resembles
the
shaggy
otterhound
and
as
at
present
favoured
it
is
larger
and
higher
on
the
leg
than
the
smooth
variety
their
colouring
is
less
distinct
and
they
seem
generally
to
be
lemon
and
white
grey
and
sandy
red
their
note
is
not
so
rich
as
that
of
the
smooth
variety
in
france
the
rough
and
the
smooth
bassets
are
not
regarded
as
of
the
same
race
but
here
some
breeders
have
crossed
the
two
varieties
with
indifferent
consequences
some
beautiful
specimens
of
the
rough
basset
have
from
time
to
time
been
sent
to
exhibition
from
the
sandringham
kennels
his
majesty
the

has
always
given
affectionate
attention
to
this

leading
shows
latterly
with
sandringham
bobs
bred
in
the
home
kennels
by
sandringham
babil
ex
saracenesca
perhaps
the
most
explicit
description
of
the
perfect
is
still
that
compiled
years
ago
by
sir
john
millais
it
is
at
least
sufficiently
comprehensive
and
exact
to
serve
as
a
guide
the
basset
for
its
size
has
more
bone
perhaps
than
nearly
any
other
dog
the
skull
should
be
peaked
like
that
of
the
bloodhound
with
the
same
dignity
and
expression
the
nose
black
although
some
of
my
own
have
white
about
theirs
and
well
flewed
for
the
size
of
the
hound
i
think
the
teeth
are
extremely
small
however
as
they
are
not
intended
to
destroy
life
this
is
probably
the
reason
the
ears
should
hang
like
the
bloodhound
and
are
like
the
softest
velvet
drapery
the
eyes
are
a
deep
brown
and
are
brimful
of
affection
and
intelligence
they
are
pretty
deeply
set
and
should
show
a
considerable
haw
a
basset
is
one
of
those
hounds
incapable
of
having
a
wicked
eye
the
neck
is
long
but
of
great
power
and
in
the
a
jambes
the
flews
extend
very
nearly
down
to
the
chest
the
chest
is
more
expansive
than
even
in
the
bulldog
and
should
in
the
a
jambes
be
not
more
than
two
inches
from
the
ground
in
the
case
of
the
a
jambes
and
being
generally
lighter
their
chests
do
not
of
course
come
so
low
the
shoulders
are
of
great
power
and
terminate
in
the
crooked
feet
of
the
basset
which
appear
to
be
a
mass
of
joints
the
back
and
ribs
are
strong
and
the
former
of
great
length
the
stern
is
carried
gaily
like
that
of
hounds
in
general
and
when
the
hound
is
on
the
scent
of
game
this
portion
of
his
body
gets
extremely
animated
and
tells
me
in
my
own
hounds
when
they
have
struck
a
fresh
or
a
cold
scent
and
i
even
know
when
the
foremost
hound
will
give
tongue
the
are
very
strong
and
muscular
the
muscles
standing
rigidly
out
down
to
the
hocks
the
skin
is
soft
in
the
smooth
haired
dogs
and
like
that
of
any
other
hound
but
in
the
rough
variety
it
is
like
that
of
the
otterhound
colour
of
course
is
a
matter
of
fancy
although
i
infinitely
prefer
the
tricolour
which
has
a
tan
head
and
a
black
and
white
body
chapter
xxvii
the
dachshund
persons
unfamiliar
with
the
sporting
properties
of
this
breed
are
apt
to
refer
smilingly
to
the
dachshund
as
the
dog
that
is
sold
by
the
yard
and
few
even
of
those
who
know
him
give
credit
to
the
debonair
little
fellow
for
the
grim
work
which
he
is
intended
to
perform
in
doing
battle
with
the
vicious
badger
in
its
lair
dachshund
means
badger
dog
and
it
is
a
title
fairly
and
squarely
earned
in
his
native
germany
given
proper
training
he
will
perform
the
duties
of
several
sporting
breeds
rolled
into
one
possessing
a
wonderful
nose
combined
with
remarkable
steadiness
his
kind
will
work
out
the
coldest
scent
and
once
fairly
on
the
line
they
will
give
plenty
of
music
and
get
over
the
ground
at
a
pace
almost
incredible
dachshunds
hunt
well
in
a
pack
and
though
it
is
not
their
recognised
vocation
they
can
be
successfully
used
on
hare
on
fox
and
any
form
of
vermin
that
wears
a
furry
coat
but
his
legitimate
work
is
directed
against
the
badger
in
locating
the
brock
under
ground
worrying
and
driving
him
into
his
innermost
earth
and
there
holding
him
until
dug
out
it
is
no
part
of
his
calling
to
come
to
close
grips
though
that
often
happens
in
the
confined
space
in
which
he
has
to
work
in
this
position
a
badger
with
his
powerful
claws
digs
with
such
energy
and
skill
as
rapidly
to
bury
himself
and
the
dachshund
needs
to
be
provided
with
such
apparatus
as
will
permit
him
to
clear
his
way
and
keep
in
touch
with
his
formidable
quarry
the
badger
is
also
hunted
by
dachshunds
above
ground
usually
in
the
mountainous
parts
of
germany
and
in
the
growing
crops
of
maize
on
the
lower
slopes
where
the
vermin
work
terrible
havoc
in
the
evening
in
this
case
the
badger
is
rounded
up
and
driven
by
the
dogs
up
to
the
guns
which
are
posted
between
the
game
and
their
earths
for
this
sport
the
dog
used
is
heavier
coarser
and
of
larger
build
higher
on
the
leg
and
more
generally
houndy
in
appearance
dachshunds
are
frequently
used
for
deer
driving
in
which
operation
they
are
especially
valuable
as
they
work
slowly
and
do
not
frighten
or
overrun
their
quarry
and
can
penetrate
the
densest
undergrowth
packs
of
dachshunds
may
sometimes
be
engaged
on
wild
boar
and
as
they
are
and
excellent
swimmers
there
is
no
doubt
that
their
terrier
qualities
would
make
them
useful
assistants
to
the
otterhound
apropos
of
their
capabilities
in
the
water
it
is
the
case
that
a
year
or
two
ago
at
at
some
trials
arranged
for
by
dogs
a
dachshund
carried
off
the
first
prize
against
all
comers
as
a
companion
in
the
house
the
dachshund
has
perhaps
no
compeer
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
cleanly
in
his
habits
obedient
unobtrusive
incapable
of
smallness
affectionate
very
sensitive
to
rebuke
or
to
unkindness
and
amusingly
jealous
as
a
watch
he
is
excellent
quick
to
detect
a
strange
footstep
valiant
to
defend
the
threshold
and
to
challenge
with
deep
voice
any
intruder
yet
sensibly
discerning
his
master
friends
and
not
annoying
them
with
prolonged
growling
and
grumbling
as
many
terriers
do
when
a
stranger
is
admitted
properly
brought
up
he
is
a
perfectly
safe
and
amusing
companion
for
children
full
of
animal
spirits
and
ever
ready
to
share
in
a
romp
even
though
it
be
accompanied
by
rough
and
tumble
play
in
germany
where
he
is
the
most
popular
of
all
dogs
large
or
small
he
is
to
be
found
in
every
home
from
the
emperor
palace
downwards
and
his
quaint
appearance
coupled
with
his
entertaining
personality
is
daily
seized
upon
by
the
comic
papers
to
illustrate
countless
jokes
at
his
expense
the
origin
of
the
dachshund
is
not
very
clear
some
writers
have
professed
to
trace
the
breed
or
representations
of
it
on
the
monuments
of
the
egyptians
some
aver
that
it
is
a
direct
descendant
of
the
french
and
others
that
he
is
related
to
the
old
turnspits
the
dogs
so
excellent
in
kitchen
service
of
whom
caius
wrote
that
when
any
meat
is
to
be
roasted
they
go
into
a
wheel
where
they
turning
about
with
the
weight
of
their
bodies
so
diligently
look
to
their
business
that
no
drudge
nor
scullion
can
do
the
feat
more
cunningly
whom
the
popular
sort
hereupon
term
turnspits
certainly
the
dog
commonly
used
in
this
occupation
was
long
of
body
and
short
of
leg
very
much
resembling
the
dachshund
in
all
probability
the
dachshund
is
a
manufactured
breed
a
breed
evolved
from
a
large
type
of
hound
intermixed
with
a
terrier
to
suit
the
special
conditions
involved
in
the
pursuit
and
extermination
of
a
quarry
that
unchecked
was
capable
of
seriously
interfering
with
the
cultivation
of
the
land
he
comprises
in
his
small
person
the
characteristics
of
both
hound
and
terrier
his
wonderful
powers
of
scent
his
long
pendulous
ears
and
for
his
size
enormous
bone
speak
of
his
descent
from
the
hound
that
hunts
by
scent
in
many
respects
he
favours
the
bloodhound
and
one
may
often
see
dachshunds
which
having
been
bred
from
parents
carefully
selected
to
accentuate
some
fancy
point
have
exhibited
the
very
pronounced
peak
occipital
bone
the
protruding
haw
of
the
eye
the
loose
dewlap
and
the
colour
markings
characteristic
of
the
bloodhound
his
small
stature
iron
heart
and
willingness
to
enter
the
earth
bespeak
the
terrier
cross
the
dachshund
was
first
introduced
to
this
country
in
sufficient
numbers
to
merit
notice
in
the
early
and
speedily
attracting
notice
by
his
quaint
formation
and
undoubted
sporting
instincts
soon
became
a
favourite
at
first
appearing
at
shows
in
the
foreign
dog
class
he
quickly
received
a
recognition
of
his
claims
to
more
favoured
treatment
and
was
promoted
by
the
kennel
club
to
a
special
classification
as
a
sporting
dog
since
then
his
rise
has
been
rapid
and
he
now
is
reckoned
as
one
of
the
numerically
largest
breeds
exhibited
unfortunately
however
he
has
been
little
if
ever
used
for
sport
in
the
sense
that
applies
in
germany
and
this
fact
coupled
with
years
of
breeding
from
too
small
a
stock
or
stock
too
nearly
related
and
the
insane
striving
after
the
fanciful
and
exaggerated
points
demanded
by
judges
at
dog
shows
many
of
whom
never
saw
a
dachshund
at
his
legitimate
work
has
seriously
affected
his
usefulness
he
has
deteriorated
in
type
lost
grit
and
sense
too
and
is
often
a
parody
of
the
true
type
of
dachshund
that
is
to
be
found
in
his
native
land
to
the
reader
who
contemplates
possessing
one
or
more
dachshunds
a
word
of
advice
may
be
offered
whether
you
want
a
dog
for
sport
for
show
or
as
a
companion
endeavour
to
get
a
good
one
a
one
to
arrive
at
this
do
not
buy
from
an
advertisement
on
your
own
knowledge
of
the
breed
but
seek
out
an
expert
amateur
breeder
and
exhibitor
and
get
his
advice
and
assistance
if
you
intend
to
start
a
kennel
for
show
purposes
do
not
buy
a
dog
at
a
show
but
start
with
a
bitch
and
breed
your
own
puppies
under
the
guidance
of
the
aforementioned
expert
in
this
way
and
by
rearing
and
keeping
your
puppies
till
they
are
of
an
age
to
be
exhibited
and
at
the
same
time
carefully
noting
the
awards
at
the
best
shows
you
will
speedily
learn
which
to
retain
and
the
right
type
of
dog
to
keep
and
breed
for
and
in
future
operations
you
will
be
able
to
discard
inferior
puppies
at
an
earlier
age
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
if
you
intend
to
form
a
kennel
for
show
purposes
to
sell
or
part
with
your
puppies
too
early
it
is
notorious
with
all
breeds
that
puppies
change
very
much
as
they
grow
the
best
looking
in
the
nest
often
go
wrong
later
and
the
ugly
duckling
turns
out
the
best
of
the
litter
this
is
especially
true
of
dachshunds
and
it
requires
an
expert
to
pick
the
best
puppy
of
a
litter
at
a
month
or
two
old
and
even
he
may
be
at
fault
unless
the
puppy
is
exceptionally
well
reared
to
rear
dachshund
puppies
successfully
you
must
not
overload
them
with
fat
give
them
strengthening
food
that
does
not
lay
on
flesh
lean
raw
beef
finely
chopped
is
an
excellent
food
once
or
twice
a
day
for
the
first
few
months
and
though
this
comes
expensive
it
pays
in
the
end
raw
meat
is
supposed
to
cause
worm
troubles
but
these
pests
are
also
found
where
meat
is
not
given
and
in
any
case
a
puppy
is
fortified
with
more
strength
to
withstand
them
if
fed
on
raw
meat
than
otherwise
and
a
good
dosing
from
time
to
time
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
to
keep
him
well
and
happy
young
growing
puppies
must
have
their
freedom
to
gambol
about
and
get
their
legs
strong
never
keep
the
puppies
cooped
up
in
a
small
kennel
run
or
house
if
you
have
a
yard
give
them
the
run
of
that
or
even
the
garden
in
spite
of
what
your
gardener
may
say
they
may
do
a
little
damage
to
the
flowers
but
will
assuredly
do
good
to
themselves
they
love
to
dig
in
the
soft
borders
digging
is
second
nature
to
them
and
is
of
great
importance
in
their
development
if
you
have
not
a
garden
or
if
the
flowers
are
too
sacred
it
is
better
to
place
your
puppies
as
early
as
possible
with
respectable
cottagers
or
small
farmers
especially
the
latter
with
whom
they
will
have
entire
freedom
to
run
about
and
will
not
be
overfed
if
you
intend
to
show
your
puppies
you
should
begin
some
time
in
advance
to
school
them
to
walk
on
the
lead
and
to
stand
quiet
when
ordered
to
much
depends
on
this
in
the
judging
ring
where
a
dog
who
is
unused
to
being
on
a
lead
often
spoils
his
chances
of
appearing
at
his
best
under
the
to
him
strange
experiences
of
restraint
which
the
lead
entails
during
the
past
years
the
names
of
two
particular
dachshunds
stand
out
head
and
shoulders
above
those
of
their
competitors
champions
jackdaw
and
pterodactyl
jackdaw
had
a
wonderful
record
having
during
a
long
show
career
never
been
beaten
in
his
class
from
start
to
finish
and
having
won
many
valuable
prizes
he
was
credited
with
being
the
most
perfect
dachshund
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
england
and
probably
as
good
as
anything
in
germany
ch
jackdaw
was
a
black
and
tan
dog
bred
and
owned
by
harry
jones
of
ipswich
he
was
sired
by
ch
charkow
out
of
wagtail
and
born
july
through
his
dam
he
was
descended
from
a
famous
bitch
thusnelda
who
was
imported
by
mudie
in
the
early
she
was
a
winner
of
high
honours
in
hanover
the
name
of
jackdaw
figures
in
all
the
best
pedigrees
of
ch
pterodactyl
was
born
in
and
bred
by
willink
he
was
in
a
measure
an
outcross
from
the
standard
type
of
the
day
and
his
dam
whose
pedigree
is
in
dispute
was
thought
to
have
been
imported
after
passing
through
one
or
two
hands
he
was
purchased
by
harry
jones
and
in
his
kennel
speedily
made
a
great
name
in
the
show
ring
and
at
the
stud
and
was
eventually
sold
for
a
high
price
to
sidney
woodiwiss
who
at
that
period
had
the
largest
kennel
of
dachshunds
in
england
ptero
as
he
was
called
was
a
big
light
red
dog
with
wonderful
and
great
muscular
development
he
also
possessed
what
is
called
a
punishing
jaw
and
rather
short
ears
and
looked
a
thorough
business
dog
he
had
an
almost
unbroken
series
of
successes
at
shows
in
england
and
being
taken
to
germany
in
the
days
before
the
quarantine
regulations
he
took
the
highest
honours
in
the
class
and
a
special
prize
for
the
best
dachshund
of
all
classes
this
dog
became
the
favourite
sire
of
his
day
and
the
fashionable
colour
the
black
and
tan
thereupon
went
quite
out
of
favour
and
this
fact
coupled
with
the
reckless
amount
of
inbreeding
of
red
to
red
that
has
been
going
on
since
ptero
day
accounts
largely
for
the
prevalence
of
light
eyes
pink
noses
and
coats
of
the
dachshunds
as
a
class
there
are
strictly
speaking
three
varieties
of
dachshund
the
the
and
the
of
these
we
most
usually
find
the
in
england
and
they
are
no
doubt
the
original
stock
of
the
others
though
fairly
numerous
in
germany
very
few
are
to
be
seen
in
this
country
and
although
one
or
two
have
been
imported
the
type
has
never
seemed
to
appeal
to
exhibitors
both
the
and
varieties
have
no
doubt
been
produced
by
crosses
with
other
breeds
such
as
the
spaniel
and
probably
the
irish
terrier
respectively
in
the
variety
the
hair
should
be
soft
and
wavy
forming
lengthy
plumes
under
the
throat
lower
parts
of
the
body
and
the
backs
of
the
legs
and
it
is
longest
on
the
under
side
of
the
tail
where
it
forms
a
regular
flag
like
that
of
a
setter
or
spaniel
the
variety
shows
strongly
a
terrier
cross
by
his
varmint
expression
and
short
ears
the
germans
also
subdivide
by
colour
and
again
for
show
purposes
by
weight
these
subdivisions
are
dealt
with
in
their
proper
order
in
the
standard
of
points
and
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
here
that
all
the
varieties
colours
and
weights
are
judged
by
the
same
standard
except
in
so
far
as
they
differ
in
texture
of
coat
at
the
same
time
the
germans
themselves
do
not
regard
the
dapple
dachshunds
as
yet
so
fixed
in
type
as
the
original
coloured
dogs
and
this
exception
must
also
apply
to
the
long
and
the
rough
haired
varieties

the
old
working
terrier
there
can
hardly
have
been
a
time
since
the
period
of
the
norman
conquest
when
the
small
earth
dogs
which
we
now
call
terriers
were
not
known
in
these
islands
and
used
by
sporting
men
as
assistants
in
the
chase
and
by
husbandmen
for
the
killing
of
obnoxious
vermin
the
two
little
dogs
shown
in
the
bayeux
tapestry
running
with
the
hounds
in
advance
of
king
harold
hawking
party
were
probably
meant
for
terriers
dame
juliana
berners
in
the
fifteenth
century
did
not
neglect
to
include
the
teroures
in
her
catalogue
of
sporting
dogs
and
a
hundred
years
later
caius
gave
pointed
recognition
to
their
value

hunteth
the

but
vague
and
uncertain
evidence
nicholas
cox
who
wrote
of
sporting
dogs
in
seems
to
suggest
that
the
type
of
working
terrier
was
already
fixed
sufficiently
to
be
divided
into
two
kinds
the
one
having
shaggy
coats
and
straight
limbs
the
other
smooth
coats
and
short
bent
legs
yet
some
years
later
another
authority
blome
in
the
same
publication
was
more
guarded
in
his
statements
as
to
the
terrier
type
when
he
wrote
everybody
that
is
a
fox
hunter
is
of
opinion
that
he
hath
a
good
breed
and
some
will
say
that
the
terrier
is
a
peculiar
species
of
itself
i
will
not
say
anything
to
the
affirmative
or
negative
of
the
point
searching
for
evidence
on
the
subject
one
finds
that
perhaps
the
earliest
references
to
the
colours
of
terriers
were
made
by
daniel
in
his
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
he
described
two
sorts
the
one
rough
and
very
strong
and
most
commonly
of
a
black
or
yellowish
colour
mixed
with
white
evidently
a
dog
and
another
and
beautifully
formed
with
a
shorter
body
and
more
sprightly
appearance
generally
of
a
reddish
brown
colour
or
black
with
tanned
legs

the

kennels
of
of
a
noted
strain
were
depicted
from
life
by
reinagle
in
sportsman
published
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
in
the
text
accompanying
the
engraving
a
minute
account
is
given
of
the
peculiarities
and
working
capacities
of
the
terrier
we
are
told
that
there
were
two
breeds
the
one
larger
more
powerful
and
harder
bitten
the
other
and
smaller
with
more
style
the
were
white
with
spots
the
smooths
were
black
and
tan
the
tan
apparently
predominating
over
the
black
the
same
writer
states
that
it
was
customary
to
take
out
a
brace
of
terriers
with
a
pack
of
hounds
a
larger
and
a
smaller
one
the
smaller
dog
being
used
in
emergency
when
the
earth
proved
to
be
too
narrow
to
admit
his
bigger
companion
it
is
well
known
that
many
of
the
old
fox
hunters
have
kept
their
special
breeds
of
terrier
and
the
belvoir
the
grove
and
lord
middleton
are
among
the
packs
to
which
particular
terrier
strains
have
been
attached
that
even
a
hundred
years
ago
terriers
were
bred
with
care
and
that
certain
strains
were
held
in
especial
value
is
shown
by
the
recorded
fact
that
a
litter
of
seven
puppies
was
sold
for
guineas
a
good
price
even
in
these
days
and
that
on
one
occasion
so
high
a
sum
as
twenty
guineas
was
paid
for
a
dog
at
that
time
there
was
no
definite
and
breed
recognised
throughout
the
islands
by
a
specific
name
the
embracing
title
of
terrier
included
all
the
varieties
which
have
since
been
carefully
differentiated
but
very
many
of
the
breeds
existed
in
their
respective
localities
awaiting
national
recognition
here
and
there
some
squire
or
huntsman
nurtured
a
particular
strain
and
developed
a
type
which
he
kept
pure
and
at
many
a
and
farmstead
in
devonshire
and
cumberland
on
many
a
highland
estate
and
irish
riverside
where
there
were
foxes
to
be
hunted
or
otters
to
be
killed
terriers
of
definite
strain
were
religiously
cherished
several
of
these
still
survive
and
are
as
respectable
in
descent
and
quite
as
important
historically
as
some
of
the
favoured
and
fashionable
champions
of
our
time
they
do
not
perhaps
possess
the
outward
beauty
and
distinction
of
type
which
would
justify
their
being
brought
into
general
notice
but
as
workers
they
retain
all
the
fire
and
verve
that
are
required
in
dogs
that
are
expected
to
encounter
such
vicious
vermin
as
the
badger
and
the
fox
some
of
the
breeds
of
terriers
seen
nowadays
in
every
dog
show
were
equally
obscure
and
unknown
a
few
years
back
years
ago
the
now
popular
irish
terrier
was
practically
unknown
in
england
and
the
scottish
terrier
was
only
beginning
to
be
recognised
as
a
distinct
breed
the
welsh
terrier
is
quite
a
new
introduction
that
a
dozen
or
so
years
ago
was
seldom
seen
outside
the
principality
and
so
recently
as
the
airedale
was
merely
a
local
dog
known
in
yorkshire
as
the
waterside
or
the
bingley
terrier
yet
the
breeds
just
mentioned
are
all
of
unimpeachable
ancestry
and
the
circumstance
that
they
were
formerly
bred
within
limited
neighbourhoods
is
in
itself
an
argument
in
favour
of
their
purity
we
have
seen
the
process
of
a
sudden
leap
into
recognition
enacted
during
the
past
few
years
in
connection
with
the
white
terrier
of
the
western
highlands
a
dog
which
was
familiarly
known
in
argyllshire
centuries
ago
yet
which
has
only
lately
emerged
from
the
heathery
hillsides
around
poltalloch
to
become
an
attraction
on
the
benches
at
the
crystal
palace
and
on
the
lawns
of
the
botanical
gardens
and
the
example
suggests
the
possibility
that
in
another
decade
or
so
the
neglected
sealyham
terrier
the
ignored
terrier
of
the
borders
and
the
almost
forgotten
jack
russell
strain
may
have
claimed
a
due
recompense
for
their
long
neglect
there
are
lovers
of
the
working
earth
dogs
who
still
keep
these
strains
inviolate
and
who
greatly
prefer
them
to
the
terriers
whose
natural
activities
have
been
too
often
atrophied
by
a
system
of
artificial
breeding
to
show
points
few
of
these
old
unregistered
breeds
would
attract
the
eye
of
the
fancier
accustomed
to
judge
a
dog
parading
before
him
in
the
show
ring
to
know
their
value
and
to
appreciate
their
sterling
good
qualities
one
needs
to
watch
them
at
work
on
badger
or
when
they
hit
upon
the
line
of
an
otter
it
is
then
that
they
display
the
alertness
and
the
courage
which
have
won
for
the
english
terriers
their
name
and
fame
an
excellent
working
terrier
was
the
white
strain
kept
by
the
rev
john
russell
in
devonshire
and
distributed
among
privileged
sportsmen
about
somersetshire
and
gloucestershire
the
working
attributes
of
these
energetic
terriers
have
long
been
understood
and
the
smart
plucky
little
dogs
have
been
constantly
coveted
by
breeders
all
over
the
country
but
they
have
never
won
the
popularity
they
deserve
those
who
have
kept
both
varieties
prefer
the
russell
to
the
sealyham
terrier
which
is
nevertheless
an
excellent
worker
it
is
on
record
that
one
of
these
a
bitch
of
only
lb
weight
fought
and
killed
a
the
sealyham
derives
its
breed
name
from
the
seat
of
the
edwardes
family
near
haverfordwest
in
pembrokeshire
where
the
strain
has
been
carefully
preserved
for
well
over
a
century
it
is
a
terrier
with
a
hard
wiry
coat
frequently
whole
white
but
also
white
with
black
or
brown
markings
or
brown
with
black
they
may
be
as
heavy
as
but
lb
is
the
average
weight
some
years
ago
the
breed
seemed
to
be
on
the
down
grade
requiring
fresh
blood
from
a
outcross
one
hears
very
little
concerning
them
nowadays
but
it
is
certain
that
when
in
their
prime
they
possessed
all
the
grit
determination
and
endurance
that
are
looked
for
in
a
good
working
terrier
a
black
and
tan
terrier
was
once
common
in
suffolk
and
norfolk
where
it
was
much
used
for
rabbiting
but
it
may
now
be
extinct
or
if
not
extinct
probably
identified
with
the
welsh
terrier
which
it
closely
resembled
in
size
and
colouring
there
was
also
in
shropshire
a
breed
of
terriers
black
and
tan
on
very
short
legs
and
weighing
about
lb
or
with
long
punishing
heads
and
extraordinary
working
powers
so
too
in
lancashire
and
cheshire
one
used
to
meet
with
terriers
of
no
very
well
authenticated
strain
but
closely
resembling
the
present
breed
of
irish
terrier
and
squire
thornton
at
his
place
near
pickering
in
yorkshire
had
a
breed
of
tan
in
colour
with
a
black
stripe
down
the
back
then
there
is
the
cowley
strain
kept
by
the
cowleys
of
callipers
near
king
langley
these
are
white
dogs
marked
like
the
and
exceedingly
game
possibly
the
elterwater
terrier
is
no
longer
to
be
found
but
some
few
of
them
still
existed
a
dozen
years
or
so
ago
in
the
lake
district
where
they
were
used
in
conjunction
with
the
west
cumberland
otterhounds
they
were
not
easily
distinguishable
from
the
border
terriers
of
which
there
are
still
many
strains
ranging
from
northumberland
where
robson
of
bellingham
has
kept
them
for
many
years
to
galloway
and
ayrshire
and
the
lothians
where
their
coats
become
longer
and
less
crisp
there
are
many
more
local
varieties
of
the
working
terrier
as
for
example
the
roseneath
which
is
often
confused
with
the
poltalloch
or
white
west
highlander
to
whom
it
is
possibly
related
and
the
pittenweem
with
which
the
poltalloch
terriers
are
now
being
crossed
while
alastair
campbell
of
ardrishaig
has
a
pack
of
cairn
terriers
which
seem
to
represent
the
original
type
of
the
improved
scottie
considering
the
great
number
of
strains
that
have
been
preserved
by
sporting
families
and
maintained
in
more
or
less
purity
to
type
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
a
new
breed
may
become
fashionable
and
still
claim
the
honour
of
long
descent
they
may
not
in
all
cases
have
the
beauty
of
shape
which
is
desired
on
the
show
bench
but
it
is
well
to
remember
that
while
our
show
terriers
have
been
bred
to
the
highest
perfection
we
still
possess
in
great
britain
a
separate
order
of
earth
dogs
that
for
pluckily
following
the
fox
and
the
badger
into
their
lairs
or
bolting
an
otter
from
his
holt
can
not
be
excelled

the
world
over
chapter
xxix
the
white
english
terrier
this
dog
one
would
think
ought
by
the
dignified
title
which
he
bears
to
be
considered
a
representative
national
terrier
forming
a
fourth
in
the
distinctively
british
quartette
whose
other
members
are
the
scottish
the
irish
and
the
welsh
terriers
possibly
in
the
early
days
when
pearson
and
roocroft
bred
him
to
perfection
it
was
hoped
and
intended
that
he
should
become
a
breed
typical
of
england
he
is
still
the
only
terrier
who
owns
the
national
name
but
he
has
long
ago
yielded
pride
of
place
to
the
and
it
is
the
case
that
the
best
specimens
of
his
race
are
bred
north
of
the
border
while
instead
of
being
the
most
popular
dog
in
the
land
he
is
actually
one
of
the
most
neglected
and
the
most
seldom
seen
at
the
kennel
club
show
of
there
was
not
a
single
specimen
of
the
breed
on
view
nor
was
one
to
be
found
at
the
recent
shows
at
edinburgh
birmingham
manchester
or
islington
nor
at
the
national
terrier
show
at
westminster
it
is
a
pity
that
so
smart
and
beautiful
a
dog
should
be
suffered
to
fall
into
such
absolute
neglect
one
wonders
what
the
reason
of
it
can
be
possibly
it
is
that
the
belief
still
prevails
that
he
is
of
delicate
constitution
and
is
not
gifted
with
a
great
amount
of
intelligence
or
sagacity
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
a
potent
factor
in
hastening
the
decline
is
to
be
found
in
the
edict
against
cropping
neither
the
white
terrier
nor
the
manchester
terrier
has
since
been
anything
like
so
popular
as
they
both
were
before
april
when
the
kennel
club
passed
the
law
that
dogs
ears
must
not
be
cropped
writers
on
canine
history
and
rawdon
lee
among
the
number
tell
us
that
the
english
white
terrier
is
a
comparatively
new
breed
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
where
he
originally
sprang
from
who
produced
him
or
for
what
reason
he
was
introduced
his
existence
as
a
distinct
breed
is
dated
back
no
longer
than
forty
years
this
is
about
the
accepted
age
of
most
of
our
named
english
terriers
half
a
century
ago
before
the
institution
of
properly
organised
dog
shows
drew
particular
attention
to
the
differentiation
of
breeds
the
generic
term
terrier
without
distinction
was
applied
to
all
earth
dogs
and
the
consideration
of
colour
and
size
was
the
only
common
rule
observed
in
breeding
but
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
prove
that
a
white
terrier
resembling
the
one
now
under
notice
existed
in
england
as
a
separate
variety
many
generations
anterior
to
the
period
usually
assigned
to
its
recognition
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
there
is
a
portrait
of
mary
of
modena
queen
consort
of
james
painted
in
by
william
wissing
who
has
introduced
at
the
queen
side
a
terrier
that
is
undoubtedly
of
this
type
the
dog
has
slight
brown
or
brindle
markings
on
the
back
as
many
english
white
terriers
have
and
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
it
is
of
the
breed
from
which
this
variety
is
descended
apart
from
colour
there
is
not
a
great
difference
between
the
white
english
terrier
and
the
manchester
black
and
tan
but
although
they
are
of
similar
shape
and
partake
much
of
the
same
general
character
yet
there
is
the
distinction
that
in
the
black
and
tan
the
conservation
of
type
is
stronger
and
more
noticeable
than
in
the
white
in
which
the
correct
shape
and
action
are
difficult
to
obtain
it
ought
naturally
to
be
easier
to
breed
a
pure
white
dog
from
white
parents
than
to
breed
correctly
marked
and
well
tanned
puppies
from
perfect
black
and
tans
but
the
efforts
of
many
breeders
do
not
seem
to
support
such
a
theory
in
connection
with
the
english
terrier
whose
litters
frequently
show
the
blemish
of
a
spot
of
brindle
or
russet
these
spots
usually
appear
behind
the
ears
or
on
the
neck
and
are
of
course
a
disfigurement
on
a
dog
whose
coat
to
be
perfect
should
be
of
an
intense
and
brilliant
white
it
appears
to
be
equally
difficult
to
breed
one
which
while
having
the
desired
purity
of
colour
is
also
perfect
in
shape
and
terrier
character
it
is
to
be
noted
too
that
many
otherwise
good
specimens
are
deaf
a
fault

the

forty
years

bred
all
the
best
of
the
white
variety
and
who
made
it
popular
in
the

his

of

may
account
to

the
black
and
tan
terrier
the
black
and
tan
or
manchester
terrier
as
we
know
him
is
a
comparatively
new
variety
and
he
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
original
terrier
with
tan
and
black
colouring
which
was
referred
to
by
caius
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
which
was
at
that
time
used
for
going
to
ground
and
driving
out
badgers
and
foxes
formerly
there
was
but
little
regard
paid
to
colour
and
markings
and
there
was
a
considerably
greater
proportion
of
tan
in
the
coat
than
there
is
at
the
present
day
while
the
fancy
markings
such
as
pencilled
toes
thumb
marks
and
kissing
spots
were
not
cultivated
the
general
outline
of
the
dog
too
was
less
graceful
and
altogether
coarser
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
chief
accomplishment
of
this
terrier
was
there
are
some
extraordinary
accounts
of
his
adroitness
as
well
as
courage
in
destroying
these
vermin
the
feats
of
a
dog
called
billy
are
recorded
he
was
matched
to
destroy
one
hundred
large
rats
in
eight
minutes
and
a
half
the
rats
were
brought
into
the
ring
in
bags
and
as
soon
as
the
number
was
complete
billy
was
put
over
the
railing
into
their
midst
in
six
minutes
and
seconds
they
were
all
destroyed
in
another
match
he
killed
the
same
number
in
six
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
it
was
a
popular
terrier
in
lancashire
and
it
was
in
this
county
that
the
refining
process
in
his
shape
and
colouring
was
practised
and
where
he
came
by
the
name
of
the
manchester
terrier
like
the
white
english
terriers
the
black
and
tan
has
fallen
on
evil
days
it
is
not
a
popular
dog
among
fanciers
and
although
many
good
ones
may
be
seen
occasionally
about
the
streets
the
breed
suffers
from
want
of
the
care
and
attention
that
are
incidental
to
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
dogs
intended
for
competition
at
shows
there
are
many
who
hold
the
opinion
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
decadence
in
the
popularity
of
the
black
and
tan
terrier
notwithstanding
its
many
claims
to
favour
is
to
be
found
in
the
loss
of
that
very
alert
appearance
which
was
a
general
characteristic
before
the
kennel
club
made
it
illegal
to
crop
the
ears
of
such
as
were
intended
for
exhibition
it
must
be
admitted
that
until
very
recently
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
truth
in
the
prevalent
opinion
inasmuch
as
a
rather
heavy
ear
if
carried
erect
was
the
best
material
to
work
upon
and
from
which
to
produce
the
long
fine
and
upright
or
pricked
effect
which
was
looked
upon
as
being
the
correct
thing
in
a
cropped
dog
hence
it
followed
that
no
care
was
taken
to
select
breeding
stock
likely
to
produce
the
small
and
thin
ears
required
consequently
when
the
edict
forbidding
the
use
of
scissors
came
into
force
there
were
very
few
dogs
to
be
found
it
has
taken
at
least
ten
or
a
dozen
years
to
eradicate
the
mischief
and
even
yet
the
cure
is
not
complete
another
factor
which
has
had
a
bad
effect
is
the
belief
which
has
become
much
too
prevalent
that
a
great
deal
of
faking
has
been
practised
in
the
past
and
that
it
has
been
so
cleverly
performed
as
to
deceive
the
most
observant
judge
whereby
a
very
artificial
standard
of
quality
has
been
obtained
the
standard
of
points
by
which
the
breed
should
be
judged
is
as

modern
to
leave
no

as
to
its
derivation
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
attention
was
being
directed
to
the
improvement
of
terriers
generally
and
new
types
were
sought
for
they
were
alert
agile
little
dogs
excellent
for
work
in
the

but
the
extravagant
corinthians
of
the
time
the
young
gamesters
who
patronised

and
the
desired
to
have
a
dog
who
should
do
something
more
than
kill
rats
or
unearth
the
fox
or
bolt
the
otter
which
accomplishments
afforded
no
amusement
to
the
town
they
wanted
a
dog
combining
all
the
dash
and
gameness
of
the
terrier
with
the
heart
and
courage
and
fighting
instinct
of
the
bulldog
wherefore
the
terrier
and
the
bulldog
were
crossed
a
large
type
of
terrier
was
chosen
and
this
would
be
the
black
and
tan
or
the
early
english
white
terrier
but
probably
both
were
used
indifferently
and
for
a
considerable
period
the
result
gave
the
young
bucks
what
they
required
a
dog
that
was
at
once
a
determined
vermin
killer
and
an
intrepid
fighter
upon
whose
skill
in
the
pit
wagers
might
with
confidence
be
laid
the
animal
however
was
neither
a
true
terrier
nor
a
true
bulldog
but
an
uncompromising
mongrel
albeit
he
served
his
immediate
purpose
and
was
highly
valued
for
his
pertinacity
if
not
for
his
appearance
in
lord
camelford
possessed
one
for
which
he
had
paid
the
very
high
price
of
guineas
and
which
he
presented

dog
was
figured
in
sporting
of
the

he
was
a
specimen
with
closely
amputated
ears
a
broad
blunt
muzzle
and
a
considerable

this
was
the
kind
of

for

as

essentially
a
man
dog
and
was
vastly
in
favour
among
the
undergraduates
of
oxford
and
cambridge
gradually
the
bulldog
element
at
first
pronounced
was
reduced
to
something
like
a
fourth
degree
and
with
the
terrier
character
predominating
the
head
was
sharpened
the
limbs
were
lengthened
and
straightened
until
little
remained
of
the
bulldog
strain
but
the
dauntless
heart
and
the
fearless
fighting
spirit
together

the
frequent
reversion
to

and
visible
characteristic

as
are
the
of

period
but
fifty
years
or
so
ago
white
was
becoming
frequent
and
was
much
admired
a
strain
of
pure
white
was
bred
by
james
hinks
a
of
birmingham
and
it
is
no
doubt
to
hinks
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
elegant
of

type
that
we
know
these
birmingham

showed
a
refinement
and
grace

an
absence
of

and
coloured

betrayed

been
using

getting
away

the
advent
of
the
hinks
strain
in

fell
into
disrepute

pure
white
became
the
accepted
colour

was
a
wide
latitude
in
the
matter
of
weight
if
all
other
points
were
good
a
dog
might
weigh
anything
between

classes
were
usually
divided
for

thereafter

true
was
even

punishable
by

there

the

ignored

ran

took
resolute
action
against

practice
that

was
entirely
abandoned

the
smooth
to
attempt
to
set
forth
the
origin
of
the
as
we
know
him
would
be
of
no
interest
to
the
general
reader
and
would
entail
the
task
of
tracing
back
the
several
heterogeneous
sources
from
which
he
sprang
it
is
a
matter
of
very
little
moment
whether
he
owes
his
origin
to
the
white
english
terrier
or
to
the
crossed
with
the
black
and
tan
or
whether
he
has
a
mixture
of
beagle
blood
in
his
composition
so
it
will
suffice
to
take
him
as
he
emerged
from
the
chaos
of
mongreldom
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
rescued
in
the
first
instance
by
the
desire
of
huntsmen
or
masters
of
packs
to
produce
a
terrier
somewhat
in
keeping
with
their
hounds
and
in
the
second
place
to
the
advent
of
dog
shows
prior
to
that
time
any
dog
capable
from
his
size
conformation
and
pluck
of
going
to
ground
and
bolting
his
fox
was
a
were
he
rough
or
smooth
black
brown
or
white
the
of
the
modern
dates
from
about
the
and
no
pedigrees
before
that
are
worth
considering
from
three
dogs
then
well
known
old
jock
trap
and
tartar
he
claims
descent
and
thanks
to
the
club
and
the
great
care
taken
in
compiling
their
he
can
be
brought
down
to
of
these
three
dogs
old
jock
was
undoubtedly
more
of
a
terrier
than
the
others
it
is
a
moot
point
whether
he
was
bred
as
stated
in
most
records
of
the
time
by
captain
percy
williams
master
of
the
rufford
or
by
jack
morgan
huntsman
to
the
grove
it
seems
however
well
established
that
the
former
owned
his
sire
also
called
jock
and
that
his
dam
grove
pepper
was
the
property
of
morgan
he
first
came
before
the
public
at
the
birmingham
show
in
where
shown
by
wootton
of
nottingham
he
won
first
prize
he
subsequently
changed
hands
several
times
till
he
became
the
property
of
murchison
in
whose
hands
he
died
in
the
early
he
was
exhibited
for
the
last
time
at
the
crystal
palace
in
and
though
then
over
ten
years
old
won
second
to
the
same
owner
trimmer
at
his
best
he
was
a
smart
terrier
with
perhaps
too
much
daylight
under
him
and
wanting
somewhat
in
jaw
power
but
he
showed
far
less
of
the
type
than
did
his
contemporary
tartar
this
dog
antecedents
were
very
questionable
and
his
breeder
is
given
as
stevenson
of
chester
most
of
whose
dogs
were
pure
and
simple
save
that
they
had
drop
ears
and
short
sterns
being
in
this
respect
unlike
old
trap
whose
sire
is
generally
supposed
to
have
been
a
black
and
tan
terrier
this
dog
came
from
the
oakley
kennels
and
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
bred
by
a
miller
at
leicester
however
questionable
the
antecedents
of
these
three
terriers
may
have
been
they
are
undoubtedly
the
progenitors
of
our
present
strain
and
from
them
arose
the
kennels
that
we
have
mention
has
been
made
of
murchison
and
to
him
we
owe
in
a
great
measure
the
start
in
popularity
which
since
the
foundation
of
his
large
kennel
the
has
enjoyed
murchison
chief
opponents
in
the
early
were
gibson
of
brockenhurst
with
his
dogs
tyke
and
old
foiler
luke
turner
of
leicester
with
his
belvoir
strain
which
later
gave
us
ch
brockenhurst
joe
ch
olive
and
her
son
ch
spice
theodore
bassett
allison
and
a
year
or
so
later
frederick
burbidge
the
clarke
tinne
francis
redmond
and
vicary
about
this
time
a
tremendous
impetus
was
given
to
the
breed
by
the
formation
in
of
the
club
which
owed
its
inception
to
harding
cox
and
a
party
of
enthusiasts
seated
round
his
dinner
table
at
russell
square
among
whom
were
bassett
burbidge
doyle
allison
and
redmond
the
last
two
named
being
still
members
of
the
club
the
idea
was
very
warmly
welcomed
a
committee
formed
and
a
scale
of
points
drawn
up
which
with
but
one
alteration
is
in
vogue
every
prominent
exhibitor
or
breeder
then
and
with
few
exceptions
since
has
been
a
member
and
the
club
is
by
far
the
strongest
of
all
specialist
clubs
it
will
be
well
to
give
here
the
said
standard
of
points
head
and
ears
the
should
be
flat
and
moderately
narrow
and
gradually
decreasing
in

to

not
much

but
there
should
be
more

is
seen
in
the

of
a

not
so
in

modern
english
terrier
there

not

not
over

it

strength
anything
approaching

objectionable

otherwise
this

is
of
little

the

present
a

gay
lively

active
appearance
bone
and
strength
in
a

essentials

this
must
not

taken
to

that

in

coarse
speed

endurance
must
be
looked
to
as
well
as

and
the
symmetry
of

foxhound
taken
as
a
model
the
terrier
like
the
hound
must
on
no
account
be
leggy
nor
must
he
be
too
short
in
the
leg
he
should
stand
like
a
hunter
covering
a
lot
of
ground
yet
with
a
short
back
as
before
stated
he
will
then
attain
the
highest
degree
of
propelling
power
together
with
the
greatest
length
of
stride
that
is
compatible
with
the
length
of
his
body
weight
is
not
a
certain
criterion
of
a
terrier
fitness
for
his
work
general
shape
size
and
contour
are
the
main
points
and
if
a
dog
can
gallop
and
stay
and
follow
his
fox
up
a
drain
it
matters
little
what
his
weight
is
to
a
pound
or
so
though
roughly
speaking
it
may
be
said
he
should
not
scale
over
twenty
pounds

in
order
to
give
some
idea
of
the
extraordinary
way
in
which
the
took
the
public
taste
it
will
be
necessary
to
hark
back
and
give
a
of
the
principal
kennels
and
exhibitors
to
whom
this
was
due
in
the
year
in
which
the
club
was
formed
fred
burbidge
at
one
time
captain
of
the
surrey
eleven
had
the
principal
kennels
he
was
the
pluckiest
buyer
of
his
day
and
once
he
fancied
a
dog
nothing
stopped
him
till
it
was
in
his
kennels
he
bought
nimrod
dorcas
tweezers
and
nettle
and
with
them
and
other
discriminating
purchases
he
was
very
hard
to
beat
on
the
strange
to
say
at
this
time
he
seemed
unable
to
breed
a
good
dog
and
determined
to
have
a
clear
out
and
start
afresh
a
few
brood
bitches
only
were
retained
and
the
kennels
moved
from
champion

to
hunton

in
hertfordshire
from
thence
in
a
few
years
came
bloom

a
host
of
others
which
spread

was
dispersed

were
at
this
time
quietly
founding
a
kennel
which
perhaps
has
left
its
mark
more
indelibly
on
the
breed
than
any
before

since

fortunate

quality

for
the
most
part
to
inbreeding
very
little

introduced
with
an
inevitable
result

by
degrees
the

could
be

without

of

and
his
kennel
going
back
as
it
does
to
the
murchison
and
luke
turner
period
and
being
still
the
most
prominent
one
in
existence
we
can
date
his
earlier
efforts
from
his
purchase
of

the
dam
of

ruby
dusty

the
dam
of

have
one
of
the

sire

in
his
turn
was
the
sire

a

to

the
result
that
even
outside

kennels
no
dog
has
any
chance
of
permanently
holding
his

about

point
much
neglected
in
the
dog
amongst
the
smaller
kennels
is
that
of
reeks
now
mostly
identified
with

he
will
always
be

as
the

have
all
written

ladies
have
ever
been
supporters
of

and
no
one
more
prominently
so
than
bennett
edwards
who
through
duke
of
doncaster
a
son
of
durham
has
founded
a
kennel
which
at
times
is
almost
invincible
and
which
still
shelters
such
grand
terriers
as
doncaster
dominie
dodger
dauphine
and
many
others
well
known
to
fame
brown
too
as
the
owner
of
captain
double
a
terrier
which
has
won
and
deservedly
more
prizes
than
any
now
or
in
the
past
must
not
be
omitted
whether
the
present
is
as
good
both
on
the
score
of
utility
and
appearance
as
his
predecessors
is
a
question
which
has
many
times
been
asked
and
as
many
times
decided
in
the
negative
as
well
as
in
the
affirmative
it
would
be
idle
to
pretend
that
a
great
many
of
the
dogs
now
seen
on
the
show
bench
are
fitted
to
do
the
work
nature
intended
them
for
as
irrespective
of
their
make
and
shape
they
are
so
oversized
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
going
to
ground
in
any
average
sized
earth
this
question
of
size
is
one
that
must
sooner
or
later
be
tackled
in
some
practical
way
by
the
club
unless
we
are
to
see
a
race
of
giants
in
the
next
few
generations
their
own
standard
gives
a
very
liberal
maximum
but
there
are
dogs
several
pounds
heavier
constantly
winning
prizes
at
shows
and
consequently
being
bred
from
with
the
result
which
we
see
there
are
many
little
dogs
and
good
ones
to
be
seen
but
as
long
as
the
judges
favour
the
big
ones
these
hold
no
chance
and
as
it
is
far
easier
to
produce
a
good
big
one
than
a
good
little
one
breeders
are
encouraged
to
use
sires
who
would
not
be
looked
at
if
a
line
were
drawn
over
which
no
dogs
should
win
a
prize
there
are
hundreds
of
about
quite
as
capable
of
doing
their
work
as
their
ancestors
ever
were
and
there
is
hardly
a
large
kennel
which
has
not
from
time
to
time
furnished
our
leading
packs
with
one
or
more
dogs
and
with
gratifying
results
it
is
therefore
a
great
pity
that
our
leading
exhibitors
should
often
be
the
greatest
delinquents
in
showing
dogs
which
they
know
in
their
hearts
should
be
kept
at
home
or
drafted
altogether
and
it
is
deplorable
that
some
of
our
oldest
judges
should
by
their
awards
encourage
them
before
concluding
this
chapter
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
say
a
few
words
as
to
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
fox
terriers
in
the
first
place
breed
from
an
animal
whose
pedigree
is
not
authenticated
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
remember
that
while
like
beget
like
the
inevitable
tendency
is
to
throw
back
to
former
generations
the
man
who
elects
to
breed
must
have
the
bumps
of
patience
and
hope
very
strongly
developed
as
if
the
tyro
imagines
that
he
has
only
to
mate
his
bitch
to
one
of
the
known
dogs
of
the
day
in
order
to
produce
a
champion
he
had
better
try
some
other
breed
let
him
fix
in
his
mind
the
ideal
dog
and
set
to
work
by
patient
effort
and
in
the
face
of
many
disappointments
to
produce
it
it
is
not
sufficient
that
having
acquired
a
bitch
good
in
all
points
save
in
head
that
he
breeds
her
to
the
dog
he
can
find
he
must
satisfy
himself
that
the
head
is
not
a
chance
one
but
is
an
inherited
one
handed
down
from
many
generations
good
in
this
particular
and
consequently
potent
to
reproduce
its
like
so
in
all
other
points
that
he
wishes
to
reproduce
in
the
writer
experience
little
bitches
with
quality
are
the
most
successful
those
having
masculine
characteristics
should
be
avoided
and
the
best
results
will
be
obtained
from
the
first
three
litters
after
which
a
bitch
rarely
breeds
anything
so
good
see
that
your
bitch
is
free
from
worms
before
she
goes
to
the
dog
then
feed
her
well
and
beyond
a
dose
of
castor
oil
some
days
before
she
is
due
to
whelp
let
nature
take
its
course
dose
your
puppies
well
for
worms
at
eight
weeks
old
give
them
practically
as
much
as
they
will
eat
and
unlimited
exercise
avoid
the
various
advertised
nostrums
and
rely
rather
on
the
friendly
advice
of
some
fancier
or
your
veterinary
surgeon
take
your
hobby
seriously
and
you
will
be
amply
repaid
even
if
success
does
not
always
crown
your
efforts
as
while
the
breeding
of
most
animals
is
a
fascinating
pursuit

chapter
xxxiii
the
the
is
with
the
exception
of
its
coat
identical
with
the
smooth
full
brother
in
fact
to
him
the
two
varieties
are
much
interbred
and
several
litters
in
consequence
include
representatives
of
both
and
not
only
this
but
it
is
quite
a
frequent
occurrence
to
get
a
smooth
puppy
from
parents
although
for
some
generations
neither
of
the
parents
may
have
had
any
smooth
cross
in
their
pedigrees
the
north
of
england
and
south
wales
to
a
lesser
extent
have
ever
been
the
home
of
the
and
nearly
all
the
best
specimens
have
come
originally
from
one
or
the
other
of
those
districts
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
was
excellent
stock
in
both
places
and
there
is
also
no
doubt
that
though
at
times
this
was
used
to
the
best
advantage
there
was
a
good
deal
of
carelessness
in
mating
and
a
certain
amount
in
recording
the
parentage
of
some
of
the
terriers
with
regard
to
this
latter
point
it
is
said
that
one
gentleman
who
had
quite
a
large
kennel
and
several
stud
dogs
but
who
kept
no
books
used
never
to
bother
about
remembering
which
particular
dog
he
had
put
to
a
certain
bitch
but
generally
satisfied
himself
as
to
the
sire
of
a
puppy
when
it
came
in
from
walk
by
just
examining
it
and
saying
oh
that
pup
must
be
by
owd
jock
or
jim
as
the
case
might
be
he
so
loike
and
down
he
would
go
on
the
entry
form
accordingly
however
this
may
be
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sire
would
be
a
and
although
the
pedigree
therefore
may
not
have
been
quite
right
the
terrier
was
invariably
pure
bred
in
the
early
days
the
smooth
was
not
crossed
with
the
wire
to
anything
like
the
extent
that
it
was
later
and
this
fact
is
probably
the
cause
of
the
salvation
of
the
variety
the
has
had
more
harm
done
to
him
by
his
being
injudiciously
crossed
with
the
smooth
than
probably
by
anything
else
the
greatest
care
must
be
exercised
in
the
matter
of
coat
before
any
such
cross
is
effected
the
smooth
that
is
crossed
with
the
wire
must
have
a
really
hard
and
not
too
full
coat
and
as
there
are
very
very
few
smooths
now
being
shown
with
anything
like
a
proper
coat
for
a
terrier
to
possess
the
very
greatest
caution
is
necessary
some
few
years
back
almost
incalculable
harm
was
done
to
the
variety
by
a
considerable
amount
of
crossing
into
a
strain
of
smooths
with
terribly
soft
flannelly
coats
terriers
were
produced
and
therein
lay
the
danger
but
their
coats
were
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
and
though
people
were
at
first
too
prone
to
look
over
this
very
serious
fault
they
now
seem
to
have
recovered
their
senses
and
thus
although
much
harm
was
done
any
serious
damage
has
been
averted
if
a
person
has
a
bitch
he
is
too
apt
to
put
her
to
a
smooth
simply
because
it
is
a
smooth
whom
he
thinks
will
neutralise
the
length
of
his
bitch
jacket
but
this
is
absolute
heresy
and
must
not
be
done
unless
the
smooth
has
the
very
hardest
of
hair
on
him
if
it
is
done
the
result
is
too
horrible
for
words
you
get
an
elongated
smooth
full
coat
as
soft
as
cotton
wool
and
sometimes
as
silkily
wavy
as
a
lady
hair
this
is
not
a
coat
for
any
terrier
to
possess
and
it
is
not
a
terrier
coat
which
ought
to
be
a
hard
crinkly
broken
coat
on
top
with
a
dense
undercoat
underneath
and
must
never
be
mistakable
for
an
elongated
smooth
terrier
coat
which
can
never
at
any
time
be
a
protection
from
wind
water
or
dirt
and
is
in
reality
the
reverse
the
has
had
a
great
advertisement
for
better
or
worse
in
the
extraordinarily
prominent
way
he
has
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
faking
and
trimming
columns
have
been
written
on
this
subject
speeches
of
inordinate
length
have
been
delivered
motions
and
resolutions
have
been
carried
rules
have
been
promulgated
and
the
one
dog
mentioned
throughout
in
connection
with
all
of
them
has
been
our
poor
old
much
maligned
he
has
been
the
scapegoat
the
subject
of
all
this
brilliancy
and
eloquence
and
were
he
capable
of
understanding
the
language
of
the
human
we
may
feel
sure
much
amusement
would
be
his
there
are
several
breeds
that
are
more
trimmed
than
the
and
that
might
well
be
quoted
before
him
in
this
connection
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
legitimate
trimming
and
what
is
called
faking
all
dogs
with
long
or
or
rough
coats
naturally
require
more
attention
and
more
grooming
than
those
with
short
smooth
coats
for
the
purposes
of
health
and
cleanliness
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
such
animals
should
be
frequently
well
groomed
there
is
no
necessity
given
a
with
a
good
and
proper
coat
to
use
anything
but
an
ordinary
comb
a
good
hard
brush
and
an
occasional
removal
of
long
old
hairs
on
the
head
ears
neck
legs
and
belly
with
the
finger
and
thumb
the
kennel
club
regulations
for
the
preparation
of
dogs
for
exhibition
are
perfectly
clear
on
this
subject
and
are
worded
most
properly
they
say
that
a
dog
shall
be
disqualified
if
any
part
of
his
coat
or
hair
has
been
cut
clipped
singed
or
rasped
down
by
any
substance
or
if
any
of
the
new
or
fast
coat
has
been
removed
by
pulling
or
plucking
in
any
manner
and
that
no
comb
shall
be
used
which
has
a
cutting
or
rasping
edge
there
is
no
law
therefore
against
the
removal
of
old
coat
by
finger
and
thumb
and
anyone
who
keeps
dogs
knows
that
it
is
essential
to
the
dog
health
that
there
should
be
none
it
is
in
fact
most
necessary
in
certain
cases
at
certain
times
to
pull
old
coat
out
in
this
way
several
terriers
with
good
coats
are
apt
to
grow
long
hair
very
thickly
round
the
neck
and
ears
and
unless
this
is
removed
when
it
gets
old
the
neck
and
ears
are
liable
to
become
infested
with
objectionable
little
nits
which
will
never
be
found
as
long
as
the
coat
is
kept
down
when
necessary
bitches
in
whelp
and
after
whelping
although
ordinarily
seem
to
go
all
wrong
in
their
coats
unless
properly
attended
to
in
this
way
and
here
again
if
you
wish
to
keep
your
bitch
free
from
skin
trouble
it
is
a
necessity
in
those
cases
which
need
it
to
use
finger
and
thumb
if
the
old
hair
is
pulled
out
only
when
it
is
old
there
is
no
difficulty
about
it
and
no
hurt
whatever
is
occasioned
to
the
dog
who
does
not
in
reality
object
at
all
if
however
new
or
fast
coat
is
pulled
out
it
not
only
hurts
the
dog
but
it
is
also
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do
and
the
person
guilty
of
such
a
thing
fully
merits
disqualification
most
of
the
nonsense
that
is
heard
about
trimming
emanates
of
course
from
the
ignoramus
the
knife
he
says
is
used
on
them
all
a
sharp
razor
is
run
over
their
coats
they
are
singed
they
are
cut
they
are
rasped
the
latter
is
the
favourite
term
anything
like
such
a
sweeping
condemnation
is
quite
inaccurate
and
most
unfair
it
is
impossible
to
cut
a
hair
without
being
detected
by
a
good
judge
and
very
few
people
ever
do
any
such
thing
at
any
rate
for
some
months
before
the
terrier
is
exhibited
for
if
they
do
they
know
they
are
bound
to
be
discovered
and
as
a
fact
are
when
the
dogs
are
clipped
they
are
operated
on
say
two
or
three
months
before
they
are
wanted
and
the
hair
gets
a
chance
to
grow
but
even
then
it
is
easily
discernible
and
anyone
who
like
the
writer
has
any
experience
of
clipping
dogs
in
order
to
cure
them
of
that
awful
disease
follicular
mange
knows
what
a
sight
the
animal
is
when
he
grows
his
coat
and
how
terribly
unnatural
he
looks
the
has
never
been
in
better
state
than
he
is
he
is
generally
speaking
far
ahead
of
his
predecessors
of
years
ago
not
only
from
a
show
point
of
view
but
also
in
working
qualities
one
has
only
to
compare
the
old
portraits
of
specimens
of
the
variety
with
dogs
of
the
present
day
to
see
this
a
good
many
individual
specimens
of
excellent
merit
it
is
true
there
were
but
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
immortalised
in
this
way
the
portraits
of
those
we
do
see
are
mostly
representations
of
brutes
as
bad
in
shoulders
and
light
of
bone
as
they
could
be
they
appear
also
to
have
had
very
soft
coats
somewhat
akin
to
that
we
see
on
a
pomeranian
nowadays
though
it
is
true
this
latter
fault
may
have
been
that
of
the
artist
or
probably
amplified
by
him
perhaps
the
strongest
kennel
of
that
has
existed
was
that
owned
a
good
many
years
ago
by
maxwell
and
cassell
several
champions
were
in
the
kennel
at
the
same
time
and
they
were
a
sorty
lot
of
nice
size
and
won
prizes
all
over
the
country
jack
frost

again
liffey
barton
wonder
barton
marvel
and
several
other
good
ones
were
inmates
of
this
kennel
the
two
latter
especially
being
terriers
which
at
one
time
were
owned
by
sir
de
trafford
barton
marvel
was
a
very
beautiful
bitch
and
probably
the
best
of
those
named
above
though
barton
wonder
was
frequently
put
above
her
sir
de
trafford
had
for
years
a
very
good
kennel
of
the
variety
and
at
that
time
was
probably
the
biggest
and
best
buyer
carrick
of
carlisle
was
also
a
prominent
owner
years
ago
and
showed
some
excellent
terriers
the
best
being
carlisle
tack
trick
and
tyro
the
latter
was
an
exceptionally
good

sam

of

also
a
strong
kennel
always
well
shown

who
is
now
and
has
been
for
some
years
in
america

he
still
follows
his
old

will
ever
be

has
been
in
america
now
for
many
years
one
dog
of
his
who
it
is
believed
became
a
champion
viz
brittle
did
at
one
time
a
big
business
at
stud
perhaps
not
to
the
advantage
of
the
breed
for
he
was
possessed
of
a
very
bad
fault
in
that
he
had
what
was
called
a
topknot
ring
a
bunch
of
soft
silky
hairs
on
his
forehead
an
unfailing
sign
of
a
soft
coat
all
over
and
a
thing
which
breeders
should
studiously
avoid
this
topknot
was
at
one
time
more
prevalent
than
it
is
now
whether
it
is
a
coincidence
or
not
one
can
not
say
but
it
is
a
fact
that
in
the
writer
experience
several
terriers
possessed
of
this
fault
have
also
blue
markings
which
again
are
almost
invariably
accompanied
by
a
soft
coat
and
taking
these
two
peculiarities
together
it
would
seem
that
at
some
time
years
ago
a
cross
with
that
wonderfully
game
but
exceedingly
terrier
the
bedlington
may
have
been
resorted
to
though
if
so
it
would
appear
that
nowadays
any
effect
of
it
is
gradually
dying

as

as

and

are
all
old
fanciers
who
have
great
experience
have
bred
and
shown

specimens
in
mentioning
the
names
of
celebrated
men
and
terriers
of
years
gone
by
reference
must
be
made
to
a
terrier
shown
some
time
ago
which
was
as
good
taken
all
round
as
any
that
have
so
far
appeared
this
was
ch
quantock

afterwards
purchased
by
a
gentleman
in
wales
and
renamed
lexden
nettle
of
correct
size
with
marvellous
character
an
excellent
jacket
and
very
takingly
marked
with
badger
tan
and
black
on
a
wonderful
head
and
ears
this
bitch
swept
the
board
as
they
say
and
unquestionably
rightly
so
no
article
on
the
would
be
complete
without
mentioning
the
name
of
the
late
shirley
president
of
the
kennel
club
shirley
was
a
successful
exhibitor
in
the
early
days
of
the
variety
and
while
his
terriers
were
a
lot
though
not
up
to
the
show
form
of
they
were
invariably
game
dogs
kept
chiefly
for
work
on
the
question
of
size
nearly
all
the
principal
judges
of
the
are
agreed
their
maxim
is
a
good
little
one
can
always
beat
a
good
big
one
the
difficulty
arises
when
the
little
ones
are
no
good
and
the
big
ones
are
excellent
it
is
a
somewhat
common
occurrence
and
to
anyone
who
loves
a
truly
formed
dog
and
who
knows
what
a
truly
formed
dog
can
do
it
is
an
extremely
difficult
thing
to
put
the
little
above
the
larger
all
big
dogs
with
properly
placed
shoulders
and
sound
formation
are
better
terriers
for
work
of
any
sort
than
dogs
half
their
size
short
on
the
leg
but
bad
in
these
points
it
is
in
reality
impossible
to
make
an
inexorable
rule
about
this
question
of
size
each
class
must
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
chapter
xxxiv
the
airedale
terrier
there
is
perhaps
no
breed
of
dog
that
in
so
short
a
time
has
been
improved
so
much
as
the
airedale
he
is
now
a
very
beautiful
animal
whereas
but
a
few
years
back
although
maybe
there
were
a
few
fairly
nice
specimens
by
far
the
greater
number
were
certainly
the
reverse
of
this
in
place
of
the
shaggy
brute
with
large
hound
ears
and
big
full
eyes
we
have
now
a
very
handsome
creature
possessing
all
the
points
that
go
to
make
a
really
terrier
of
taking
colour
symmetrical
build
full
of
character
and
go
amply
justifying
in
looks
at
any
rate
its
existence
as
a
terrier
whether
it
is
common
sense
to
call
a
dog
weighing
lb
to
lb
a
terrier
is
a
question
that
one
often
hears
discussed
the
fact
remains
the
dog
is
a
terrier
a
sort
of
glorified
edition
of
what
we
understand
by
the
word
it
is
true
but
in
points
looks
and
character
a
terrier
nevertheless
and
it
is
impossible
otherwise
to
classify
him
people
will
ask
how
can
he
be
a
terrier
why
he
is
an
outrage
on
the
very
word
which
can
only
mean
a
dog
to
go
to
ground
and
to
what
animal
in
the
country
of
his
birth
can
an
airedale
go
to
ground
above
ground
and
in
water
however
an
airedale
can
and
does
perform
in
a
very
excellent
manner
everything
that
any
other
terrier
can
do
as
a
water
dog
he
is
of
course
in
his
element
for
work
on
land
requiring
a
hard
strong
fast
and
resolute
terrier
he
is
needless
to
say
of
great
value
and
he
is
said
to
be
also
when
trained
as
can
easily
be
imagined
when
one
considers
his
power
of
scent
his
strength
sagacity
and
speed
a
most
excellent
he
is
in
fact
a
general
utility
dog
for
add
to
the
qualities
those
of
probably
an
incomparable
guard
and
a
most
excellent
companion
faithful
and
true
and
ask
yourself
what
do
you
want
more
and
what
breed
of
dog
taken
all
round
can
beat
him
the
airedale
is
not
of
ancient
origin
he
was
probably
first
heard
of
about
the
year
he
is
undoubtedly
the
product
of
the
otterhound
and
the
old
black
and
tan
terrier
referred
to
in
the
chapters
on
the
fox
and
the
welsh
terriers
when
one
considers
the
magnificent
nobleness
the
great
sagacity
courage
and
stateliness
of
the
otterhound
the
great
gameness
cheek
and
pertinacity
of
the
old
black
and
tan
such
a
cross
must
surely
produce
an
animal
of
excellent
type
and
character
yorkshire
more
especially
that
part
of
it
round
and
about
the
town
of
otley
is
responsible
for
the
birth
of
the
airedale
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
of
broad
acres
are
and
always
have
been
exceedingly
fond
of
any
kind
of
sport
as
indeed
may
also
be
said
of
their
brothers
of
the
red
rose
but
if
in
connection
with
that
sport
a
dog
has
to
be
introduced
then
indeed
are
they
doubly
blessed
for
they
have
no
compeers
at
the
game
was
formerly
much
indulged
in
by
the
people
living
in
the
dales
of
the
aire
and
the
wharfe
and
not
only
were
packs
of
otterhounds
kept
but
many
sportsmen
maintained
on
their
own
account
a
few
hounds
for
their
personal
delectation
these
hounds
were
no
doubt
in
some
instances
a
nondescript
lot
as
indeed
are
several
of
the
packs
hunting
the
otter
but
there
was
unquestionably
a
good
deal
of
otterhound
blood
in
them
and
some
pure
bred
hounds
were
also
to
be
found
yorkshire
also
has
always
been
the
great
home
of
the
terrier
as
we
now
know
them
had
at
this
time
hardly
been
seen
the
terrier
in
existence
then
was
the
black
and
tan
a
hardy
game
terrier
a
great
workman
on
land
or
in
water
whether
by
design
or
accident
is
not
known
but
the
fact
remains
that
in
or
about
the
year
mentioned
a
cross
took
place
between
these
same
hounds
and
terriers
it
was
found
that
a
handier
dog
was
produced
for
the
business
for
which
he
was
required
and
it
did
not
take
many
years
to
populate
the
district
with
these
which
soon
came
to
be
recognised
as
a
distinct
breed
the
waterside
terrier
was
the
name
first
vouchsafed
to
the
new
variety
after
this
they
went
by
the
name
of
bingley
terriers
and
eventually
they
came
to
be
known
under
their
present
appellation
the
specimens
of
the
airedale
which
were
first
produced
were
not
of
very
handsome
appearance
being
what
would
now
be
called
bad
in
colour
very
shaggy
coated
and
naturally
big
and
ugly
in
ear
it
of
course
took
some
time
to
breed
the
hound
out
at
all
satisfactorily
some
authorities
tell
us
that
for
this
purpose
the
common
fighting
pit
and
also
the
irish
terrier
were
used
the
latter
to
a
considerable
extent
and
whether
this
is
correct
or
not
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
would
also
be
many
crosses
back
again
into
the
small
black
and
tan
terrier
primarily
responsible
for
his
existence
in
about
twenty
years
time
the
breed
seems
to
have
settled
down
and
become
thoroughly
recognised
as
a
variety
of
the
terrier
it
was
not
however
for
some
ten
years
after
this
that
classes
were
given
for
the
breed
at
any
representative
show
in
the
committee
of
the
national
show
at
birmingham
included
three
classes
for
airedales
in
their
schedule
which
were
fairly
well
supported
and
three
years
after
this
recognition
was
given
to
the
breed
in
the
of
the
ruling
authority
from
this
time
on
the
breed
prospered
pretty
well
several
very
good
terriers
were
bred
the
hound
gradually
almost
disappeared
as
also
did
to
a
great
extent
the
ones
the
best
example
amongst
the
early
shown
dogs
was
undoubtedly
newbold
test
who
had
a
long
and
very
successful
career
this
dog
excelled
in
terrier
character
and
he
was
sound
all
over
his
advent
was
opportune
he
was
just
the
dog
that
was
wanted
and
there
is
no
doubt
he
did
the
breed
a
great
amount
of
good
a
dog
called
colne
crack
who
was
a
beautiful
little
terrier
was
another
of
the
early
shown
ones
by
whom
the
breed
has
lost
nothing
and
two
other
terriers
whose
names
are
much
revered
by
lovers
of
the
breed
are
cholmondeley
briar
and
briar
test
some
years
ago
when
the
breed
was
in
the
stage
referred
to
above
a
club
was
formed
to
look
after
its
interests
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
though
perhaps
phenomenal
success
did
not
attend
its
efforts
it
did
its
best
and
forms
a
valuable
link
in
the
chain
of
popularity
of
the
airedale
it
was
at
best
apparently
a
sleepy
sort
of
concern
and
never
seems
to
have
attracted
new
fanciers
some
dozen
or
so
years
ago
however
a
club
destined
not
only
to
make
a
great
name
for
itself
but
also
to
do
a
thousandfold
more
good
to
the
breed
it
espouses
than
ever
the
old
club
did
was
formed
under
the
name
of
the
south
of
england
airedale
terrier
club
and
a
marvellously
successful
and
popular
life
it
has
so
far
lived
the
younger
club
was
in
no
way
an
antagonist
of
the
older
one
and
it
has
ever
been
careful
that
it
should
not
be
looked
upon
in
any
way
as
such
the
old
club
has
however
been
quite
overshadowed
by
the
younger
which
whether
it
wishes
it
or
not
is
now
looked
upon
as
the
leading
society
in
connection
with
the
breed
at
a
meeting
of
the
first

went

was

possessed
of
perhaps
unequalled
natural
advantages
lovely
dog
as
he
is
he
had
not
made
that
progress
that
he
should
have
done
he
had
not
been
boomed
in
any
way
and
had
been
crawling
when
he
should
have
galloped
from
the
moment
the
new
club
was
formed
however
the
airedale
had
a
new
lease
of
life
holland
buckley
and
other
keen
enthusiasts
seem
to
have
recognised
to
a
nicety
exactly
what
was
required
to
give
a
necessary
fillip
to
the
breed
they
appear
also
to
have
founded
their
club
at
the
right
moment
and
to
have
offered
such
an
attractive
bill
of
fare
that
not
only
did
everyone
in
the
south
who
had
anything
to
do
with
airedales
join
at
once
but
very
shortly
a
host
of
new
fanciers
was
enrolled
and
crowds
of
people
began
to
take
the
breed
up
who
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
or
indeed
any
other
sort
of
dog
previously
some
few
years
after
the
foundation
of
this
club
a
junior
branch
of
it
was
started
and
this
ably
looked
after
by
lauder
mclaren
is
almost
as
big
a
success
in
its
way
as
is
the
parent
institution
other
clubs
have
been
started
in
the
north
and
elsewhere
and
altogether
the
airedale
is
very
well
catered
for
in
this
respect
and
if
things
go
on
as
they
are
now
going
is
bound
to
prosper
and
become
even
more
extensively
owned
than
he
is

the

the

the

he
has
produced
several
very
excellent
specimens
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
he
is
when
he
can
be
induced
to
take
the

a
judge
buckley
has
frequently
told
the
writer
that
in
his
opinion
one
of
the
best
terriers
he
has
seen
was
the
aforesaid
clonmel
floriform
but
as
this
dog
was
sold
for
a
big
price
very
early
in
his
career
the
writer
never
saw
him
most
of
the
articles
that
have
been
written
on
the
airedale
have
come
from
the
pen
of
buckley
and
therefore
but
modest
reference
is
made
to
the
man
who
has
worked
so
so
well
and
so
successfully
in
the
interests
of
the
breed
he
loves
it
would
be
ungenerous
and
unfair
in
any
article
on
the
airedale
written
by
anyone
but
buckley
if
conspicuous
reference
were
not
made
to
the
great
power
this
gentleman
has
been
and
to
the
great
good
that
he
has
done
the
airedale
is
such
a
beautiful
specimen
of
the
canine
race
and
is
in
reality
in
such
healthy
state
that
every
one
of
his
admirers
and
they
are
legion
is
naturally
jealous
for
his
welfare
and
is
wishful
that
all
shall
go
well
with
him
it
is
gratifying
to
state
that
he
has
never
been
the
tool
of
faction
though
at
one
time
he
was
doubtless
near
the
brink
but
this
was
some
time
ago
and
it
would
be
a
grievous
pity
if
he
ever
again
became
in
jeopardy
of
feeling
the
baneful
influence
of
any
such
curse
there
is
one
serious
matter
in
connection
with
him
however
and
that
is
the
laxity
displayed
by
some
judges
of
the
breed
in
giving
prizes
to
dogs
shown
in
a
condition
with
regard
to
their
coats
which
ought
to
disentitle
them
to
take
a
prize
in
any
company
shockingly
shoulders
are
becoming
quite
a
common
thing
to
see
in
airedales
there
is
no
necessity
for
this
sort
of
thing
it
is
very
foolish
and
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
anything
more
likely
to
do
harm
to
a
breed
than
that
the
idea
should
get
abroad
that
this
is
the
general
practice
in

the
bedlington
terrier
this
gamest
of
all
the
terriers
has
been
known
as
a
distinct
and
thoroughly
british
breed
for
over
a
century
which
is
i
think
a
fairly
ancient
lineage
there
are
various
theories
as
to
its
original
parentage
but
the
one
which
holds
that
he
was
the
result
of
a
cross
between
the
otterhound
and
the
dandie
dinmont
suggests
itself
to
me
as
the
most
probable
one
his
characteristics
strongly
resemble
in
many
points
both
these
breeds
and
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
of
his
near
relationship
at
some
time
or
other
to
the
dandie
the
earliest
authentic
record
we
have
of
the
bedlington
was
a
dog
named
old
flint
who
belonged
to
squire
trevelyan
and
was
whelped
in
the
pedigree
of
william
clark
scamp
a
dog
well
known
about
is
traced
back
to
old
flint
and
the
descendants
of
scamp
were
traced
in
direct
line
from
to
a
mason
named
joseph
aynsley
has
the
credit
for
giving
the
name
of
bedlington
to
this
terrier
in
it
was
previously
known
as
the
rothbury
terrier
or
the
northern
counties
thomas
pickett
of
was
perhaps
the
earliest
supporter
of
the
breed
on
a
large
scale
and
his
tynedale
and
tyneside
in
especial
have
left
their
names
in
the
history
of
the
bedlington
the
present
day
bedlington
like
a
good
many
other
terriers
has
become
taller
and
heavier
than
the
old

this
no
doubt
is
due
to
breeding
for
show

a

dog
but
not

be

somewhat
light

has
plenty

anything

general
appearance
he
is
a
lathy
dog
but
not
shelly
there
is
a
tendency
nowadays
towards
excess
of
size
in
the
bedlington
it
is
inclined
to
be
too
long
in
the
body
and
too
leggy
which
if
not
checked
will
spoil
the
type
of
the
breed
it
is
therefore
very
important
that
size
should
be
more
studied
by
judges
than
is
at
present
the
case
the
faults
referred
to
are
doubtless
the
result
of
breeding
for
exceptionally
long
heads
which
seem
to
be
the
craze
just
now
and
of
course
one
can
not
get
extra
long
heads
without
proportionately
long
bodies
and
large
size
if
it
were
possible
to
do
so
then
the
dog
would
become
a
mere
caricature
as
a
sporting
terrier
the
bedlington
holds
a
position
in
the
first
rank
he
is
very
fast
and
enduring
and
exceedingly
pertinacious
and
is
equally
at
home
on
land
and
in
water
he
will
work
an
otter
draw
a
badger
or
bolt
a
fox
and
he
has
no
superior
at
killing
rats
and
all
kinds
of
vermin
he
has
an
exceptionally
fine
nose
and
makes
a
very
useful
dog
for
rough
shooting
being
easily
taught
to
retrieve
if
he
has
any
fault
at
all
it
is
that
he
is
of
too
jealous
a
disposition
which
renders
it
almost
impossible
to
work
him
with
other
dogs
as
he
wants
all
the
fun
to
himself
and
if
he
can
not
get
it
he
will
fight
for
it
but
by
himself
he
is
perfect
as
a
companion
he
is
peculiarly
affectionate
and
faithful
and
remarkably
intelligent
he
makes
a
capital
is
a
good
guard
and
is
very
safe
with
children
bedlingtons
are
not
dainty
feeders
as
most
writers
have
asserted
nor
are
they
tender
dogs
if
they
are
kept
in
good
condition
and
get
plenty
of
exercise
they
feed
as
well
as
any
others
and
are
as
hard
as
nails
if
not
pampered
they
are
easy
to
breed
and
rear
and
the
bitches
make
excellent
mothers
if
trained
when
young
they
are
very
obedient
and
their
tendency
to
fight
can
in
a
great
measure
be
cured
when
they
are
puppies
but
if
not
checked
then
it
can
not
be
done
afterwards
once
they
take
to
fighting
nothing
will
keep
them
from
it
and
instead
of
being
pleasurable
companions
they
become
positive
nuisances
on
the
other
hand
if
properly
broken
they
give
very
little
trouble
and
will
not
quarrel
unless

the
irish
terrier
the
irish
terrier
has
most
certainly
made
his
home
in
our
bosom
there
is
no
breed
of
dog
more
genuinely
loved
by
those
who
have
sufficient
experience
and
knowledge
to
make
the
comparison
other
dogs
have
a
larger
share
of
innate
wisdom
others
are
most
aesthetically
beautiful
others
more
peaceable
but
our
rufous
friend
has
a
way
of
winning
into
his
owner
heart
and
making
there
an
abiding
place
which
is
all
the
more
secure
because
it
is
gained
by
sincere
and
undemonstrative
devotion
perhaps
one
likes
him
equally
for
his
faults
as
for
his
merits
his
very
failings
are
due
to
his
soldierly
faithfulness
and
loyalty
to
his
too
ardent
vigilance
in
guarding
the
threshold
to
his
officious
belligerence
towards
other
canines
who
offend
his
sense
of
proprietorship
in
his
master
his
particular
stature
may
have
some
influence
in
his
success
as
a
chum
he
is
just
tall
enough
to
rest
his
chin
upon
one
knee
and
look
up
with
all
his
soul
into
one
eyes
whatever
be
the
secret
of
his
attraction
is
certain
that
he
has
the
hibernian
art
of
compelling
affection
and
forgiveness
and
that
he
makes
one
value
him
not
for
the
beauty
of
his
ruddy
raiment
the
straightness
of
his
the
set
of
his
eye
and
ear
the
levelness
of
his
back
or
his
ability
to
win
prizes
but
rather
for
his
true
and
trusty
heart
that
exacts
no
return
and
seeks
no
recompense
he
may
be
but
an
indifferent
specimen
of
his
kind
taken
in
as
a
stranger
at
the
gates
but
when
at
length
the
inevitable
time
arrives
as
it
does
all
too
soon
in
canine
nature
one
then
discovers
how
surely
one
has
been
harbouring
an
angel
unawares
statistics
would
probably
show
that
in
numbers
the
justifies
the
reputation
of
being
a
more
popular
breed
and
the
scottish
terrier
is
no
doubt
a
formidable
competitor
for
public
esteem
it
is
safe
however
to
say
that
the
irish
terrier
shares
with
these
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
three
most
popular
terriers
in
the
british
isles
this
fact
taken
into
consideration
it
is
interesting
to
reflect
that
thirty
years
ago
the
was
virtually
unknown
in
england
idstone
in
his
book
on
dogs
published
in
did
not
give
a
word
of
mention
to
the
breed
and
dog
shows
had
been
instituted
sixteen
years
before
a
class
was
opened
for
the
irish
terrier
the
dog
existed
of
course
in
its
native
land
it
may
indeed
be
almost
truthfully
said
to
have
existed
as
long
as
that
country
has
been
an
island
about
the
year
experts
were
in
dispute
over
the
irish
terrier
and
many
averred
that
his
rough
coat
and
length
of
hair
on
forehead
and
muzzle
were
indubitable
proof
of
scotch
blood
his
very
expression
they
said
was
scotch
but
the
argument
was
quelled
by
more
knowing
disputants
on
the
other
side
who
claimed
that
ireland
had
never
been
without
her
terrier
and
that
she
owed
no
manner
of
indebtedness
to
scotland
for
a
dog
whose
every
hair
was
essentially
irish
in
the
same
year
at
a
show
held
in
belfast
a
goodly
number
of
the
breed
were
brought
together
notable
among
them

working

said
to
have

an
important
dog
historically
for
various
reasons
he
was
undoubtedly
more
akin
to
our
present
type
than
any
other
irish
terrier
of
his
time
of
which
there
is
record
his
dark
ears
were
uncropped
at
a
period
when
cropping
was
general
his
weight
approximated
to
our
modern
average
he
was
an
all
coloured
red
and
his
legs
were
of
a
length
that
would
not
now
be
seriously
objected
to
but
in
his
day
he
was
not
accepted
as

which

departed
from

discussions
were
frequent
before
a
standard
of
perfection
for
the
irish

was
fixed
his
size
and

the
length
or
shortness
of
his
limbs
the
carriage
of
his
tail
the
form
of
his
skull
and
muzzle
the
colour
and
texture
of
his
coat
were
the
subjects
of
controversy
it
was
considered
at
one
juncture
that
he
was
being
bred
too
big
and
at
another
that
he
was
being
brought
too
much
to
resemble
a
red
when
once
the
black
marking
on
his
body
had
been
eliminated
no
one
seems
to
have
desired
that
it
should
be
restored
red
was
acknowledged
to
be
the
one
and
only
colour
for
an
irish
terrier
but
some
held
that
the
correct
red
should
be
deep
auburn
and
others
that
wheaten
colour
was
the
tone
to
be
aimed
at
a
medium
shade
between
the
two
extremes
is
now
generally
preferred
as
to
size
it
should
be
about
midway
between
that
of
the
airedale
and
the
represented
by
a
weight
of
from
to
lb
the
two
breeds
just
mentioned
are
as
a
rule
superior
to
the
irish
terrier
in
front
legs
and
feet
but
in
the
direction
of
these
points
great
improvements
have
recently
been
observable
the
heads
of
our
irish
terriers
have
also
been
brought
nearer
to
a
level
of
perfection
chiselled
to
the
desired
degree
of
leanness
with
the
determined
expression
so
characteristic
of
the
breed
and
with
the
length
squareness
and
strength
of
muzzle
which
formerly
were
so
difficult
to
find
this
squareness
of
head
and
jaw
is
an
important

the
irish
terrier
as
a
breed
is
an
exception
being
remarkably
notably
so
with
mankind
it
being
admitted
however
that
he
is
perhaps
a
little
too
ready
to
resent
interference
on
the
part
of
other
dogs
there
is
a
heedless
reckless
pluck
about
the
irish
terrier
which
is
characteristic
and
coupled
with
the
headlong
dash
blind
to
all
consequences
with
which
he
rushes
at
his
adversary
has
earned
for
the
breed
the
proud
epithet
of
the
when
they
are
characterised
by
a
quiet
appearance
and
when
one
sees
them
endearingly
timidly
pushing
their
heads
into
their
masters
hands
it
is
difficult
to
realise
that
on
occasions
at
the
set
on
they
can
prove
they
have
the
courage
of
a
lion
and
will
fight
unto
the
last
breath
in
their
bodies
they
develop
an
extraordinary
devotion
to
and
have
been
known
to
track
their

incredible

it
is
difficult
to
refer
to
particular
irish
terriers
of
without
making
invidious
distinctions
there
are
so
many
excellent
examples
of
the
breed
that
a
list
even
of
those
who
have
gained
championship
honours
would
be
formidable
but
one
would
hardly
hesitate
to
head
the
list
with
the
name
of
paymaster
a
dog
of
rare
and
almost
superlative
quality

these
are
but
half
a

but
they
represent
the
highest
level
of

that
has
yet
been
achieved
by
scientific
breeding
in
irish
terrier
type
breeding
up
to
the
standard
of
excellence
necessary
in
competition
in
dog
shows
has
doubtless
been
the
agent
which
has
brought
the
irish
terrier
to
its
present
condition
of
perfection
and
it
is
the
means
by
which
the
general
dog
owning
public
is
most
surely
educated
to
a
practical
knowledge
of
what
is
a
desirable
and
what
an
undesirable
dog
to
possess
but
after
all
success
in
the
show
ring
is
not
the
one
and
only
thing
to
be
aimed
at
and
the
irish
terrier
is
not
to
be
regarded
merely
as
the
possible
winner
of
prizes
he
is
above
all
things
a
dog
for
man
companionship
and
in
this
capacity
he
takes
a
favoured
place
he
has
the
great
advantage
of
being
equally
suitable
for
town
and
country
life
in
the
home
he
requires
no
pampering
he
has
a
good
hardy
constitution
and
when
once
he
has
got
over
the
ills
incidental
to
puppyhood
worms
and
distemper
he
needs
only
to
be
judiciously
fed
kept
reasonably
clean
and
to
have
his
fill
of
active
exercise
if
he
is
taught
to
be
obedient
and
of
gentlemanly
habit
there
is
no
better
house
dog
he
is
naturally
intelligent
and
easily
trained
although
he
is
always
ready
to
take
his
own
part
he
is
not
quarrelsome
but
remarkably
and
a
safe
associate
of
children
perhaps
with
his
boisterous
spirits
he
is
prone
sometimes
to
be
in
the
pursuit
of
trespassing
tabbies
and
in
assailing
the
ankles
of
intruding
butcher
boys
and
officious
postmen
these
characteristics
come
from
his
sense
of
duty
which
is
strongly
developed
and
careful
training
will
make
him
discriminative
in
his
assaults
very
justly
is
he
classed
among
the
sporting
dogs
he
is
a
born
sportsman
and
of
his
pluck
it
were
superfluous
to
speak
fear
is
unknown
to
him
in
this
characteristic
as
in
all
others
he
is
truly
a
son

chapter
xxxvii
the
welsh
terrier
this
breed
is
near
akin
to
the
the
principal
differences
being
merely
of
colour
and
type
the
welsh
terrier
is
a
black
or
grizzle
and
tan
the
most
taking
colouring
is
a
jet
black
body
and
back
with
deep
tan
head
ears
legs
belly
and
tail
several
specimens
have
however
black
foreheads
skulls
ears
and
tail
and
the
black
will
frequently
be
seen
also
extending
for
a
short
way
down
the
legs
there
must
be
no
black
however
below
the
hock
and
there
must
be
no
substantial
amount
of
white
anywhere
a
dog
possessing
either
of
these
faults
is
according
to
the
recognised
standard
of
the
breed
disqualified
many
of
the
most
successful
bench
winners
have
nevertheless
been
possessed
of
a
little
white
on
the
chest
and
even
a
few
hairs
of
that
colour
on
their
hind
toes
and
apparently
by
the
common
consent
of
all
the
judges
of
the
breed
they
have
been
in
nowise
handicapped
for
these
blemishes
there
are
not
so
many
grizzle
coloured
welsh
terriers
now
as
there
used
to
be
a
grizzle
and
tan
never
looks
so
smart
as
a
black
and
tan
but
though
this
is
so
if
the
grizzle
is
of
a
dark
hard
colour
its
owner
should
not
be
handicapped
as
against
a
black
and
tan
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
grizzle
a
judge
is
entitled
to
handicap
its
possessor
apart
altogether
from
the
fact
that
any
such
colour
on
the
back
is
invariably
accompanied
by
an
objectionable
light
tan
on
the
legs
the
whole
being
a
certain
sign
of
a
soft
silky
unterrierlike
coat
the
coat
of
the
welsh
terrier
slightly
differs
from
that
of
the
in
that
it
is
as
a
rule
not
so
abundant
and
is
in
reality
a
different
class
of
coat
it
is
not
so
broken
as
is
that
of
the
and
is
generally
a
smoother
shorter
coat
with
the
hairs
very
close
together
when
accompanied
with
this
there
is
a
dense
undercoat
one
has
for
a
terrier
used
to
work
a
good
deal
in
water
an
ideal
covering
as
waterproof
almost
as
the
feathers
on
a
duck
back
the
other
difference
between
the
fox
and
welsh
terrier
type
is
very
hard
to
define
to
anyone
who
really
understands
welsh
terriers
the
selection
of
those
of
proper
type
from
those
of
wrong
type
presents
little
if
any
difficulty
as
a
exhibit
the
welsh
terrier
is
not
more
than
years
old
he
has
however
resided
in
wales
for
centuries
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
in
reality
identical
with
the
old
black
and
tan
dog
which
was
england
first
terrier
and
which
has
taken
such
a
prominent
part
in
the
production
and
evolution
of
all
the
other
varieties
of
the
sporting
terrier
there
are
several
people
living
in
or
about
carnarvonshire
who
can
show
that
welsh
terriers
have
been
kept
by
their
ancestors
from
at
any
rate
a
hundred
to
two
hundred
years
ago
notable
among
these
is
the
present
master
of
the
ynysfor
otterhounds
whose
great
grandfather
john
jones
of
ynysfor
owned
welsh
terriers
in
or
about
the
year
this
pack
of
otterhounds
has
always
been
kept
by
the
jones
of
ynysfor
who
have
always
worked
and
still
work
welsh
terriers
with
them
from
this
strain
some
good
terriers
have
sprung
and
this
although
neither
the
present
master
nor
any
of
his
ancestors
have
concerned
themselves
greatly
about
the
looks
of
their
terriers
or
kept
anything
but
a
head
record
of
their
pedigrees
they
are
all
however
pure
bred
and
are
set
much
store
on
by
their
owner
and
his
family
just
as
they
always
have
been
by
their
predecessors
until
about
the
year
no
one
seems
to
have
considered
the
question
of
putting
specimens
of
the
breed
on
the
show
bench
about
that
year
however
several
gentlemen
interested
in
the
variety
met
together
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
connection
with
the
matter
the
outcome
being
that
the
welsh
terrier
club
was
shortly
afterwards
founded
the
kennel
club
recognised
the
breed
and
the
terrier
himself
began
his
career
as
a
show
dog
the
specimens
which
were
first
shown
were
as
may
be
imagined
not
a
very
lot
although
the
breed
had
been
kept
pure
no
care
had
been
taken
in
the
culture
of
it
except
that
which
was
necessary
to
produce
a
sporting
game
terrier
able
to
do
its
work
one
can
readily
understand
therefore
that
such
an
entirely
fancy
point
as
a
long
foreface
and
narrow
clean
skull
had
never
been
thought
of
for
a
moment
and
it
was
in
these
particulars
that
the
welsh
terrier
at
first
failed
from
a
show
point
of
view
naturally
enough
good
shoulders
sound
more
than
fair
legs
and
feet
and
excellent
jackets
were
to
be
found
in
abundance
but
as
the
body
was
almost
invariably
surmounted
by
a
very
short
and
head
and
jaw
often
accompanied
with
a
pair
of
heavy
round
ears
an
undershot
mouth
and
a
light
full
eye
it
will
be
realised
that
the
general
appearance
of
the
dog
was
not
prepossessing
the
welsh
terrier
is
very
much
improved
beyond
what
he
was
when
first
put
on
the
bench
this
improvement
has
been
brought
about
by
careful
and
judicious
breeding
from
nothing
but
pure
bred
specimens
no
outside
aid
has
been
invoked
at
any
rate
in
the
production
of
any
of
the
best
terriers
and
none
has
been
required
it
is
a
matter
for
great
congratulation
that
the
breed
has
been
kept
pure
despite
all
temptation
and
exhortation
the
welsh
terrier
breeds
as
true
as
steel
you
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
had
popular
clamour
had
its
way
years
ago
goodness
only
know
what
monstrosities
would
now
be
being
bred
the
colour
of
the
welsh
terrier
is
of
course
against
him
for
working
with
a
pack
of
hounds
especially
in
water
it
is
only
fair
however
to
the
breed
to
say
that
barring
this
colour
drawback
there
is
no
better
terrier
to
hounds
living
they
are
not
quarrelsome
show
very
little
jealousy
one
of
another
in
working
can
therefore
easily
be
used
exercised
and
kennelled
together
being
much
better
in
this
respect
than
any
of
the
other
breeds
of
terriers
they
also
as
a
general
rule
are
dead
game
they
want
a
bit
of
rousing
and
are
not
so
flashily
showily
game
as
say
the
but
just
as
with
humans
when
it
comes
to
business
when
the
talking
game
is
played
out
and
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
part
of
the
business
then
one
experience
invariably
is
that
the
quiet
man
the
quiet
terrier
is
the
animal
wanted
on
the
formation
of
the
welsh
terrier
club
a
standard
of
perfection
was
drawn
up
and
circulated
with
the
club
rules
this
standard
has
remained
unchanged
up
to
the
present
day
and
is
as

the
scottish
terrier
as
a
show
dog
dates
from
about
to
he
seems
almost
at
once
to
have
attained
popularity
and
he
has
progressed
gradually
since
then
ever
in
an
upward
direction
until
he
is
one
of
the
most
popular
and
extensively
owned
varieties
of
the
dog
sir
paynton
pigott
had
at
the
date
mentioned
a
very
fine
kennel
of
the
breed
for
in
live
stock
of
may
we
find
his
kennel
fully
reviewed
in
a
most
enthusiastic
manner
by
a
correspondent
who
visited
it
in
consequence
of
a
controversy
that
was
going
on
at
the
time
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
dog
at
all
and
who
therefore
wished
to
see
and
judge
for
himself
as
to
this
point
at
the
end
of
his
report
on
the
kennel
the
writer
adds
these
words
it
was
certainly
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
to
have
the
pleasure
of
looking
over
so
many
grand
little
dogs
but
to
find
them
in
england
quite
staggered
me
four
dogs
and
eight
bitches
are
not
a
bad
beginning
and
with
care
and
judicious
selection
in
mating
i
have
little
doubt
but
pigott
kennel
will
be
as
renowned
for
terriers
as
the
late
laverack
was
for
setters
i
know
but
few
that
take
such
a
delight
in
the
brave
little
as
pigott
and
he
may
well
feel
proud
of
the
lot
he
has
got
together
at
great
trouble
and
expense

the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
kennel
already
in
existence
proved
of
course
a
strong
point
in
favour
of
the
of
the
breed
the
best
dog
in
it
was
granite
whose
portrait
and
description
were
given
in
the
in
connection
with
the
said
review
and
the
other
animals
of
the
kennel
being
of
the
same
type
it
was
at
once
recognised
that
there
was
in
fact
such
a
breed
and
the
mouths
of
the
doubters
were
stopped
granite
was
unquestionably
a
typical
scottish
terrier
even
as
we
know
them
at
the
present
day
he
was
certainly
longer
in
the
back
than
we
care
for
nowadays
and
his
head
also
was
shorter
and
his
jaw
more
snipy
than
is
now
seen
but
his
portrait
clearly
shows
he
was
a
genuine
scottish
terrier
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
with
his
kennel
mates
tartan
crofter
syringa
cavack
and
posey
conferred
benefit
upon
the
breed
to
dive
deeper
into
the
antiquity
of
the
scottish
terrier
is
a
thing
which
means
that
he
who
tries
it
must
be
prepared
to
meet
all
sorts
of
abuse
ridicule
and
criticism
one
man
will
tell
you
there
never
was
any
such
thing
as
the
scottish
terrier
that
the
mere
fact
of
his
having
prick
ears
shows
he
is
a
mongrel
another
that
he
is
merely
an
offshoot
of
the
skye
or
the
dandie
another
that
the
only
scottish
terrier
that
is
a
scottish
terrier
is
a
white
one
another
that
he
is
merely
a
manufactured
article
from
aberdeen
and
so
on
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
fact
that
scotland
should
have
unto
herself
so
many
different
varieties
of
the
terrier
there
is
strong
presumption
that
they
one
and
all
came
originally
from
one
variety
and
it
is
quite
possible
nay
probable
that
different
crosses
into
other
varieties
have
produced
the
assortment
of
the
writer
is
strongly
of
opinion
that
there
still
exist
in
scotland
at
the
present
time
specimens
of
the
breed
which
propagated
the
lot
which
was
what
is
called
even
now
the
highland
terrier
a
little
prick
or
mostly
sandy
and
terrier
game
as
a
pebble
lively
as
a
cricket
and
all
in
all
a
most
charming
little
companion
and
further
that
to
produce
our
scottish
terrier
or
shall
we
say
to
improve
the
points
of
his
progenitor
the
assistance
of
our
old
friend
the
black
and
tan
terrier
of
england
was
sought
by
a
few
astute
people
living
probably
not
very
far
from
aberdeen
scottish
terriers
frequently
go
by
the
name
of
aberdeen
terriers
an
appellation
it
is
true
usually
heard
only
from
the
lips
of
people
who
do
not
know
much
about
them
mccandlish
one
of
the
greatest
living
authorities
on
the
breed
in
an
able
treatise
published
some
time
back
tells
us
in
reference
to
this
matter
that
the
terrier
under
notice
went
at
different
periods
under
the
names
of
highland
cairn
aberdeen
and
scotch
that
he
is
now
known
by
the
proud
title
of
scottish
terrier
and
that
the
only
surviving
trace
of
the
differing
nomenclature
is
the
title
aberdeen
which
many
people
still
regard
as
a
different
breed
a
want
of
knowledge
frequently
turned
to
account
by
the
unscrupulous
dealer
who
is
able
to
sell
under
the
name
of
aberdeen
a
dog
too
bad
to
dispose
of
as
a
scottish
terrier
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
originally
there
must
have
been
reason
for
the
name
in
a
letter
to
the
writer
sir
paynton
pigott
says
some
people
call
them
and
advertise
them
as
the
aberdeen
terrier
which
is
altogether
a
mistake
but
the
reason
of
it
is
that
forty
years
ago
a
van
bust
who
lived
in
aberdeen
bred
these
terriers
to
a
large
extent
and
sold
them
and
those
buying
them
called
them
in
consequence
terriers
whereas
they
were
in
reality
merely
a
picked
sort
of
old
scotch
or
highland
terrier
sir
paynton
himself
as
appears
from
the
columns
of
live
stock
march
bought
some
of
the
strain
of
van
bust
and
therein
gives
a
full
description
of
the
same
sir
paynton
pigott
kennel
of
the
breed
assumed
quite
large
proportions
and
was
most
successful
several
times
winning
all
the
prizes
offered
in
the
variety
at
different
shows
he
may
well
be
called
the
father
of
the
breed
in
england
for
when
he
gave
up
exhibiting
a
great
deal
of
his
best
blood
got
into
the
kennels
of
ludlow
who
as
everyone
knows
has
done
such
a
tremendous
amount
of
good
in
popularising
the
breed
and
has
also
himself
produced
such
a
galaxy
of
specimens
of
the
very
best
class
ludlow
first
terrier
was
a
bitch
called
splinter
ii
the
name
of
kildee
is
in
the
breed
almost
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
every
line
does
he
go
back
to
the
said
splinter
ii
rambler
called
by
the
great
authorities
the
first
pillar
of
the
stud
book
was
a
son
of
a
dog
called
and
it
is
to
this
latter
dog
and
roger
rough
and
also
the
aforesaid
tartan
and
splinter
ii
that
nearly
all
of
the
best
pedigrees
go
back
this
being
so
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
many
more
names
of
dogs
who
have
in
their
generations
of
some
years
back
assisted
in
bringing
the
breed
to
its
present
state
of
perfection
an
exception
however
must
be
made
in
the
case
of
two
sons
of
rambler
by
name
dundee
and
alister
names
very
familiar
in
the
scottish
terrier
pedigrees
of
the
present
day
alister
especially
was
quite
an
extraordinary
stud
dog
his
progeny
were
legion
and
some
very
good
terriers
of
own
him
as
progenitor
in
nearly
every
line
the
best
descendants
of
alister
were
kildee
tiree
whinstone
prince
alexander
and
heather
prince
he
was
apparently
too
much
inbred
to
and
though
he
produced
or
was
responsible
for
several
beautiful
terriers
it
is
much
to
be
doubted
whether
in
a
breed
which
is
suffering
from
the
of
too
much
inbreeding
he
was
not
one
of
the
greatest
sinners
the
scottish
terrier
club
was
formed
in
the
year

up

sent
carefully

hundred

most
probably
would
not
have
so
highly
valued
a
strain
as
he
evidently
did
value
the
terrieres
from
argyll
we
may
take
it
then
that
in
the
argyllshire
terriers
were
considered
to
be
the
best
in
scotland
and
likely
enough
too
seeing
the
almost
boundless
opportunities
the
county
gives
for
the
work
of
the
earth
dogges
but
men
kept
their
dogs
in
the
evil
days
for
work
and
not
for
points
and
mighty
indifferent
were
they
whether
an
ear
cocked
up
or
lay
flat
to
the
cheek
whether
the
tail
was
exactly
of
fancy
length
or
how
high
to
a
hair
breadth
it
stood
these
things
are
qua
on
the
modern
show
bench

were
not
thought
of
in

cruel
hard
fighting
days

old

those
days
two
things
and
two
things
only
were
imperatively
necessary
pluck
and
capacity
to
get
at
the
quarry
this
entailed
that
the
body
in
which
the
pluck
was
enshrined
must
be
small
and
most
active
to
get
at
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
lair
and
that
the
body
must
be
protected
by
the
best
possible
teeth
and
jaws
for
fighting
on
a
strong
and
rather
long
neck
and
directed
by
a
most
capable
brain
it
is
held
that
feet
turned
out
a
little
are
better
for
scrambling
up
rocks
than
perfectly
straight
like
feet
in
addition
it
was
useful
to
have
your
dog
of
a
colour
easy
to
see
when
in
motion
though
no
great
weight
was
laid
upon
that
point
as
in
the
days
before
newspapers
and
trains
men
eyes
were
good
as
a
rule
still
the
quantity
of
white
in
the

get
gradually
harder
towards
the
haunches
but
the
harsh
coat
beloved
of
the
show
bench
is
all
nonsense
and
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
as
anyone
can
try
who
will
dip
his
own
hair
into
the
now
fashionable
baths
the
outer
coat
should
be
distinctly
but
not
long
in
the
or
show
sense
still
it
should
be
long
enough
to
hang
as
a
thatch
over
the
soft
woolly
real
coat
of
the
animal
and
keep
it
dry
so
that
a
good
shake
or
two
will
throw
off
most
of
the
water
while
the
under
coat
should
be
so
thick
and
naturally
oily
that
the
dog
can
swim
through
a
river
and
not
get
wet
or
be
able
to
sit
out
through
a
drenching
rain
guarding
something
of
his
master
and
be
none
the
worse
this
under
coat
i
at
least
have
never
seen
a
judge
look
for
but
for
the
working
terrier
it
is
most
important
the
size
of
the
dog
is
perhaps
best
indicated
by
weight
the
dog
should
not
weigh
more
than
nor
the
bitch
more
than
lb
there
is
among
judges
i
find
with
all
respect
i
say
it
an
undue
regard
for
weight
and
what
is
called
strength
also
for
grooming
which
means
brushing
or
plucking
out
all
the
long
hair
to
gratify
the
judge
one
might
as
well
judge
of
sandow
strength
not
by
his
performances
but
by
the
kind
of
wax
he
puts
on
his
moustache
the
west
highland
terrier
of
the
old
sort
i
do
not
of
course
speak
of
bench
dogs
earned
their
living
following
fox
badger
or
otter
wherever
these
went
underground
between
over
or
under
rocks
that
no
man
could
get
at
to
move
and
some
of
such
size
that
a
hundred
men
could
not
move
them
and
oh
the
beauty
of
their
note
when
they
came
across
the
right
scent
i
want
my
readers
to
understand
this
and
not
to
think
of
a
highland
as
if
it
were
an
english
dug
in
sand
nor
of
badger
work
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
locating
the
badger
and
then
digging
him
out
no
the
badger
makes
his
home
amongst
rocks
the
small
ones
perhaps
two
or
three
tons
in
weight
and
probably
he
has
his
end
against
one
of
three
or
four
hundred
tons
no
digging
him
out
and
moreover
the
passages
between
the
rocks
must
be
taken
as
they
are
no
scratching
them
a
little
wider
so
if
your
dog
ribs
are
a
trifle
too
big
he
may
crush
one
or
two
through
the
narrow
slit
and
then
stick
he
will
never
be
able
to
pull
himself
back
at
least
until
starvation
has
so
reduced
him
that
he
will
probably
be
unable
if
set
free
to
win
as
we
say
in
scotland
his
way
back
to
the
open
i
remember
a
tale
of
one
of
my
father
terriers
who
got
so
lost
the
keepers
went
daily
to
the
cairn
hoping
against
hope
at
last
one
day
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
were
seen
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
they
did
not
disappear
when
the
dog
name
was
called
a
brilliant
idea
seized
one
of
the
keepers
the
dog
evidently
could
not
get
up
so
a
rabbit
skin
was
folded
into
a
small
parcel
round
a
stone
and
let
down
by
a
string
the
dog
at
once
seized
the
situation
and
the
skin
held
on
was
drawn
up
and
fainted
on
reaching
the
mouth
of
the
hole
he
was
carried
home
tenderly
and
nursed
he
recovered
referring
to
the
characteristics
of
this
terrier
colonel
malcolm
continues
attention
to
breeding
as
to
colour
has
undoubtedly
increased
the
whiteness
but
other
points
being
good
a
dog
of
the
west
highland
white
terrier
breed
is
not
to
be
rejected
if
he
shows
his
descent
by
a
slight
degree
of
pale
red
or
yellow
on
his
back
or
his
ears
i
know
an
old
argyllshire
family
who
consider
that
to
improve
their
terriers
they
ought
all
to
have
browny
yellow
ears
neither
again
except
for
the
show
bench
is
there
the
slightest
objection
to
half
drop
ears
the
points
of
one
or
both
ears
just
falling
over
unfortunately
the
show
bench
has
a
great
tendency
to
spoil
all
breeds
from
too
much
attention
being
given
to
what
is
evident
and
ears
are
grand
things
for
judges
to
pin
their
faith
to
also
they
greatly
admire
a
fine
long
face
and
what
is
called
but
wrongly
called
a
strong
jaw
meaning
by
that
an
ugly
heavy
face
i
have
often
pointed
out
that
the
tiger
the
cat
the
otter
all
animals
remarkable
for
their
strength
of
jaw
have
exceedingly
short
faces
but
their
bite
is
cruelly
hard
and
what
again
could
be
daintier
than
the
face
of
a
fox
the
terrier
of
the
west
highlands
of
scotland
has
come
down
to
the
present
day
built
on
what
i
may
perhaps
call
the
fox
lines
and
it
is
a
type
evolved
by
work
hard
and
deadly
dangerous
work
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
dogs
have
been
bred
for
show
the
terrier
which
at
present
rules
the
roost
dates
from
as
a
show
dog
i
therefore
earnestly
hope
that
no
fancy
will
arise
about
these
dogs
which
will
make
them
less
hardy
less
wise
less
companionable
less
active
or
less
desperate
fighters
underground
than
they
are
at
present
a
young
dog
that
i
gave
to
a
keeper
got
its
stomach
torn
open
in
a
fight
it
came
out
of
the
cairn
to
its
master
to
be
helped
he
put
the
entrails
back
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
then
the
dog
slipped
out
of
his
hands
to
finish
the
fight
and
forced
the
fox
out
into
the
open
that
is
the
spirit
of
the
breed
but
alas
that
can
not
be
exhibited
on
the
show
bench
they
do
say
that
a
keeper
of
mine
when
chaffed
by
the
about
the
baby
faces
of
his
was
driven
to
ask
can
any
of
you
gentlemen
oblige
me
with
a
cat
and
i
show
you
i
did
not
hear
him
say
it
so
it
may
only
be
a
tale
anyhow
i
have
in
my
kennel
a
dog
who
at
ten
months
old
met
a
vixen
fox
as
she
was
bolting
out
of
her
cairn
and
he
at
once
caught
her
by
the
throat
stuck
to
her
till
the
pack
came
up
and
then
on
till
she
was
killed
in
the
course
of
one
month
his
wounds
were
healed
and
he
had
two
other
classical
fights
one
with
a
cat
and
the
other
with
a
dog
fox
not
bad
for
a
pup
with
a
face
i
trust
my
readers
understand
that
the
west
highland
white
terriers
are
not
white
aberdeens
not
a
new
invention
but
have
a
most
respectable
ancestry
of
their
own
i
add
the
formal
list
of
points
but
this
is
the
work
of
show
bench
experts
and
it
will
be
seen
from
what
i
have
written
that
i
do
not
agree
with
them
on
certain
particulars
there
should
be
feather
to
a
fair
degree
on
the
tail
but
if
experts
will
not
allow
it
put
rosin
on
your
hands
and
pull
the
hair
out
and
the
rosin
will
win
your
prize
the
eye
should
not
be
sunk
which
gives
the
sulky
look
of
the
terrier
but
should
be
full
and
bright
and
the
expression
friendly
and
confiding
the
skull
should
not
be
narrow
anywhere
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
black
nails
in
a
dog
of
pure
breed
and
the
black
soon
wears
off
the
pad
work
so
folk
must
understand
this
on
two
occasions
recently
i
have
shown
dogs
acknowledged
as
dogs
to
be
quite
first
class
you
see
they
are
not
the
proper
type
the
judges
unfortunately
have
as
yet
their
eyes
filled
with
the
terrier
type
and
prefer
mongrels
that
show
it
to
the
real
pure
standard
of
points
the
general
appearance
of
the

the
dandie
dinmont
the
breed
of
terrier
now
known
as
the
dandie
dinmont
is
one
of
the
races
of
the
dog
which
can
boast
of
a
fairly
ancient
lineage
though
it
is
impossible
now
to
say
what
was
the
exact
origin
of
this
breed
we
know
that
it
was
first
recognised
under
its
present
name
after
the
publication
of
scott
in
the
year
and
we
know
that
for
many
years
previously
there
had
existed
in
the
border
counties
a
race
of
terrier
the
constant
and
very
effective
companion
of
the
border
farmers
and
others
in
their
expeditions
various
theories
have
been
suggested
by
different
writers
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
breed
was
founded
some
say
that
the
dandie
is
the
result
of
crossing
a
strain
of
terriers
with
the
dachshund
others
that
a
terrier
was
crossed
with
the
otterhound
and
others
again
assert
that
no
direct
cross
was
ever
introduced
to
found
the
breed
but
that
it
was
gradually
evolved
from
the
terriers
of
the
border
district
and
this
latter
theory
is
probably
correct
the
dandie
would
appear
to
be
closely
related
to
the
bedlington
terrier
in
both
breeds
we
find
the
same
indomitable
pluck
the
same
pendulous
ear
and
a
light
silky
topknot
adorning
the
skull
of
each
but
the
dandie
was
evolved
into
a
dog
and
the
bedlington
became
a
dog
indeed
to
illustrate
the
close
relationship
of
the
two
breeds
a
case
is
quoted
of
the
late
lord
antrim
who
in
the
early
days
of
dog
shows
exhibited
two
animals
from
the
same
litter
and
with
the
one
obtained
a
prize
or
honourable
mention
in
the
dandie
classes
and
with
the
other
a
like
distinction
in
the
bedlington
classes
it
may
be
interesting
to
give
a
few
particulars
concerning
the
traceable
ancestors
of
the
modern
dandie
in
charles
cook
book
on
this
breed
we
are
given
particulars
of
one
william
allan
of
holystone
born
in
and
known
as
piper
allan
and
celebrated
as
a
hunter
of
otters
and
foxes
and
for
his
strain
of
terriers
who
so
ably
assisted
him
in
the
chase
william
allan
terriers
descended
to
his
son
james
also
known
as
the
piper
and
born
in
the
year
james
allan
died
in
and
was
survived
by
a
son
who
sold
to
francis
somner
at
yetholm
a
terrier
dog
named
old
pepper
descended
from
his
grandfather
famous
dog
hitchem
old
pepper
was
the
of
somner
dog
shem
these
terriers
belonging
to
the
allans
and
others
in
the
district
are
considered
by
cook
to
be
the
earliest
known
ancestors
of
the
modern
dandie
dinmont
sir
walter
scott
himself
informs
us
that
he
did
not
draw
the
character
of
dandie
dinmont
from
any
one
individual
in
particular
but
that
the
character
would
well
fit
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
lidderdale
yeomen
of
his
acquaintance
however
owing
to
the
circumstance
of
his
calling
all
his
terriers
mustard
and
pepper
without
any
other
distinction
except
auld
and
young
and
little
the
name
came
to
be
fixed
by
his
associates
upon
one
james
davidson
of
hindlee
a
wild
farm
in
the
teviotdale
mountains
james
davidson
died
in
the
year
by
which
time
the
dandie
dinmont
terrier
was
being
bred
in
considerable
numbers
by
the
border
farmers
and
others
to
meet
the
demand
for
it
which
had
sprung
up
since
the
appearance
of
as
a
result
of
the
controversies
that
were
continually
recurring
with
regard
to
the
points
of
a
typical
dandie
dinmont
there
was
formed
in
the
year
the
dandie
dinmont
terrier
club
with
the
object
of
settling
the
question
for
ever
and
for
this
purpose
all
the
most
noted
breeders
and
others
interested
were
invited
to
give
their
views
upon
it
the
standard
of
points
adopted
by
the
club
is
as
follows
head
strongly
made
and
large
not
out
of
proportion
to
the
size
the
muscles
showing
extraordinary
development
more
especially
the
maxillary
skull
broad
between
the
ears
getting
gradually
less
towards
the
eyes
and
measuring
about
the
same
from
the
inner
corner
of
the
eyes
to
back
of
skull
as
it
does
from
ear
to
ear
the
forehead
well
domed
the
head
is
covered
with
very
soft
silky
hair
which
should
not
be
confined
to
a
mere
topknot
and
the
lighter
in
colour
and
silkier
it
is
the
better
the
cheeks
starting
from
the
ears
proportionately
with
the
skull
have
a
gradual
taper
towards
the
muzzle
which
is
deep
and
strongly
made
and
measures
about
three
inches
in
length
or
in
proportion
to
skull
as
three
is
to
five
the
muzzle
is
covered
with
hair
of
a
little
darker
shade
than
the
topknot
and
of
the
same
texture
as
the
feather
of
the
the
top
of
the
muzzle
is
generally
bare
for
about
an
inch
from
the
black
part
of
the
nose
the
bareness
coming
to
a
point
towards
the
eye
and
being
about
one
inch
broad
at
the
nose
the
nose
and
inside
of
mouth
black
or
dark
coloured
the
teeth
very
strong
especially
the
canine
which
are
of
extraordinary
size
for
such
a
small
dog
the
canines
fit
well
into
each
other
so
as
to
give
the
greatest
available
holding
and
punishing
power
and
the
teeth
are
level
in
front
the
upper
ones
very
slightly
overlapping
the
under
ones
many
of
the
finest
specimens
have
a
swine
mouth
which
is
very
objectionable
but
it
is
not
so
great
an
objection
as
the
protrusion
of
the
under
jaw
eyes
set
wide
apart
large
full
round
bright
expressive
of
great
determination
intelligence
and
dignity
set
low
and
prominent
in

of
the

a
rich
dark
hazel

well
back
wide
apart
and
low
on
the
skull
hanging
close
to
the
cheek

a
very
slight
projection
at
the
base
broad
at
the
junction
of
the
head
and
tapering
almost
to
a

very
little
the
tapering
being
mostly
on
the

harmonise
in
colour
with
the

colour
in
the
case
of
a
pepper
dog
they
are
covered
with
a
soft
straight
brownish
hair
in
some
cases
almost
black
in
the
case
of
a
mustard
dog
the
hair
should
be
mustard
in
colour
a
shade
darker
than
the
body

not
black
all
should
have
a
thin
feather
of
light
hair
starting
about
two
inches
from
the
tip
and
of
nearly
the
same
colour
and
texture
as
the
topknot

gives
the
ear

is
often
one

two
years

the

this
is
a
very
important

as

these
weights
are
for
dogs
in
good
working
order
in
the
above
standard
of
points
we
have
a
very
full
and
detailed
account
of
what
a
dandie
should
be
like
and
if
only
judges
at
shows
would
bear
them
in
mind
a
little
more
we
should
have
fewer
conflicting
decisions
given
and
dandie
fanciers
and
the
public
generally
would
not
from
time
to
time
be
set
wondering
as
to
what
is
the
correct
type
of
the
breed
a
dandie
makes
an
excellent
house
guard
for
such
a
small
dog
he
has
an
amazingly
deep
loud
bark
so
that
the
stranger
who
has
heard
him
barking
on
the
far
side
of
the
door
is
quite
astonished
when
he
sees
the
small
owner
of
the
big
voice
when
kept
as
a
companion
he
becomes
a
most
devoted
and
affectionate
little
friend
and
is
very
intelligent
as
a
dog
to
be
kept
in
kennels
there
is
certainly
one
great
drawback
where
large
kennels
are
desired
and
that
is
the
risk
of
keeping
two
or
more
dogs
in
one
kennel
sooner
or
later
there
is
sure
to
be
a
fight
and
when
dandies
fight
it
is
generally
a
very
serious
matter
if
no
one
is
present
to
separate
them
one
or
both
of
the
combatants
is
pretty
certain
to
be
killed
but
when
out
walking
the
dandie
is
no
more
quarrelsome
than
other
breeds
of
terriers
if
properly
trained
from
puppyhood
there
is
one
little
matter
in
breeding
dandies
that
is
generally
a
surprise
to
the
novice
and
that
is
the
very
great
difference
in
the
appearance
of
the
young
pups
and
the
adult
dog
the
pups
are
born
quite
the
peppers
are
black
and
tan
in
colour
and
the
mustards
have
a
great
deal
of
black
in
their
colouring
the
topknot
begins
to
appear
sometimes
when
the
dog
is
a
few
months
old
and
sometimes
not
till
he
is
a
year
or
so
old
it
is
generally
best
to
mate
a
mustard
to
a
pepper
to
prevent
the
mustards
becoming
too
light
in
colour
though
two
mustards
may
be
mated
together
with
good
results
it
is
a
rather
curious
fact
that
when
two
mustards
are
mated
some
of
the
progeny
are
usually
pepper
in
colour
though
when
two
peppers
are
mated
there
are
very
seldom
any
mustard
puppies
the
popularity
of
the
dandie
has
now
lasted
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
last
for
another
century
if
breeders
will
only
steer
clear
of
the
exaggeration
of
show
points
and
continue
to
breed
a
sound
active
and
hardy
terrier
chapter
xli
the
skye
and
clydesdale
terriers
that
the
skye
terrier
should
be
called
the
heavenly
breed
is
a
tribute
to
the
favour
in
which
he
is
held
by
his
admirers
certainly
when
he
is
seen
in
perfection
he
is
an
exceedingly
beautiful
dog
as
certainly
there
is
no
breed
more
affectionate
more
faithful
or
more
lovable
among
his
characteristics
are
a
patience
a
prompt
obedience
and
a
tenderness
combined
with
fearless
courage
he
is
more
sensitive
to
rebuke
and
punishment
than
most
dogs
and
will
nurse
resentment
to
those
who
are
unjust
to
him
not
viciously
but
with
an
almost
human
plaintiveness
which
demands
an
immediate
reconciliation
he
is
staunch
and
firm
as
his
native
hills
to
those
who
are
kind
to
him
and
for
entering
into
battle
with
an
enemy
there
is
no
dog
more
recklessly
daring
and
resolute
visitors
to
dog
shows
are
disposed
to
believe
that
the
skye
terrier
with
its
coat
that
falls
in
smooth
cascades
down
its
sides
and
its
veil
of
thick
hair
that
obscures
the
tender
softness
of
its
dark
and
thoughtful
eyes
is
meant
only
to
look
beautiful
upon
the
bench
or
to
recline
in
comfortable
indolence
on
silken
cushions
this
is
a
mistake
see
a
team
of
skyes
racing
up
a
hillside
after
a
fugitive
rabbit
tirelessly
burrowing
after
a
rat
or
displaying
their
terrier
strategy
around
a
fox
earth
or
an
otter
holt
and
you
will
admit
that
they
are
meant
for
sport
and
are
demons
at
it
even
their
peculiarity
of
build
is
a
proof
that
they
are
born
to
follow
vermin
underground
they
are
long
of
body
with
short
strong
legs
adapted
for
burrowing
with
the
dachshund
they
approximate
more
closely
than
any
other
breeds
to
the
shape
of
the
badger
the
weasel
and
the
otter
and
so
many
animals
which
nature
has
made
long
and
low
in
order
that
they
may
inhabit
earths
and
insinuate
themselves
into
narrow
passages
in
the
moorland
cairns
there
can
be
no
question
that
these
dogs
which
are
so
typically
highland
in
character
and
appearance
as
well
as
the
clydesdale
the
scottish
the
dandie
dinmont
and
the
white
poltalloch
terriers
are
all
the
descendants
of
a
purely
native
scottish
original
they
are
all
but
which
was
the
parent
breed
it
is
impossible
to
determine
it
is
even
difficult
to
discover
which
of
the
two
distinct
types
of
the
skye
terrier
was
the
earlier
the
variety
whose
ears
stand
alertly
erect
or
its
near
relative
whose
ears
are
pendulous
perhaps
it
does
not
matter
the
differences
between
the
skye
and
the
are
so
slight
and
the
characteristics
which
they
have
in
common
are
so
many
that
a
dual
classification
was
hardly
necessary
the
earliest
descriptions
and
engravings
of
the
breed
present
a
terrier
considerably
smaller
than
the
type
of
carrying
a
fairly
profuse
hard
coat
with
short
legs
a
body
long
in
proportion
to
its
height
and
with
ears
that
were
neither
erect
nor
drooping
but
and
capable
of
being
raised
to
alertness
in
excitement
it
is
the
case
that
puppies
often
occur
in
the
litters
of
parents
and
as
its
name
implies
this
terrier
had
its
early
home
in
the
misty
island
of
skye
which
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
not
also
to
be
found
in
lewis
oronsay
colonsay
and
others
of
the
hebrides
as
well
as
on
the
mainland
of
scotland
johnson
who
visited
these
islands
with
boswell
in
noticed
these
terriers
and
observed
that
otters
and
weasels
were
plentiful
in
skye
that
the
foxes
were
numerous
and
that
they
were
by
small
he
was
so
accurate
an
observer
that
one
regrets
he
did
not
describe
the
macleod
terriers
and
their
work
they
were
at
that
time
of
many
colours
varying
from
pure
white
to
fawn
and
brown
and
black
the
lighter
coloured
ones
had
black
muzzles
ears
and
tails
their
tails
were
carried
more
gaily
than
would
be
permitted
by
a
modern
judge
of
the
breed
in
those
days
the
highlander
cared
less
for
the
appearance
than
he
did
for
the
sporting
proclivities
of
his
dogs
whose
business
it
was
to
oust
the
tod
from
the
earth
in
which
it
had
taken
refuge
and
for
this
purpose
certain
qualities
were
imperative
first
and
foremost
the
terrier
needed
to
be
small
short
of
leg
long
and
lithe
in
body
with
ample
face
fringe
to
protect
his
eyes
from
injury
and
possessed
of
unlimited
pluck
and
dash
the
skye
terrier
of
does
not
answer
to
each
and
every
one
of
these
requirements
he
is
too
big
decidedly
he
is
too
big
especially
in
regard
to
the
head
a
skull
with
large
ears
may
be
admirable
as
ornament
but
would
assuredly
debar
its
possessor
from
following
into
a
fox
lair
among
the
boulders
then
again
his
long
coat
would
militate
against
the
activity
necessary
for
his
legitimate
calling
it
was
not
until
about
that
the
skye
terrier
attracted
much
notice
among
dog
lovers
south
of
the
border
but
queen
admiration
of
the
breed
of
which
from
onwards
she
always
owned
favourite
specimens
and
sir
edwin
landseer
paintings
in
which
the
skye
was
introduced
had
already
drawn
public
attention
to
the
decorative
and
useful
qualities
of
this
terrier
the
breed
was
included
in
the
first
volume
of
the
kennel
club
stud
book
and
the
best
among
the
early
dogs
were
such
as
pratt
gillie
and
dunvegan
fyfe
novelty
john
bowman
dandie
and
macdona
rook
these
were
mostly
of
the
variety
and
were
bred
small
about
the
year
fierce
and
stormy
disputes
arose
concerning
the
distinctions
of
the
scottish
breeds
of
terriers
the
controversy
was
continued
until
when
the
kennel
club
was
approached
with
the
view
to
furnishing
classes
the
controversy
was
centred
upon
three
types
of
scottish
terriers
those
which
claimed
to
be
pure
skye
terriers
a
dog
described
briefly
as
scotch
and
a
third
which
for
a
time
was
miscalled
the
aberdeen
to
those
who
had
studied
the
varieties
the
distinctions
were
clear
but
the
question
at
issue
was
to
which
of
the
three
rightly
belonged
the
title
of
scottish
terrier
the
dog
which
the
scots
enthusiasts
were
trying
to
get
established
under
this
classification
was
the
cairn
terrier
of
the
highlands
known
in
some
localities
as
the
working
skye
and
in
others
as
the
or
a
of
this
breed
was
the
more
leggy
aberdeen
variety
the
skye
is
without
doubt
one
of
the
most
beautiful
terriers
in
existence
he
is
a
dog
of
medium
size
with
a
weight
not
exceeding
and
not
less
than
lb
he
is
long
in
proportion
to
his
height
with
a
very
level
back
a
powerful
jaw
with
perfectly
fitting
teeth
a
small
hazel
eye
and
a
long
hard
coat
just
reaching
the
ground
in
the
variety
the
ears
are
carried
erect
with
very
fine
ear
feathering
and
the
face
fringe
is
long
and
thick
the
ear
feathering
and
face
fall
are
finer
in
quality
than
the
coat
which
is
exceedingly
hard
and
and
here
it
is
well
to
point
out
that
the
skye
has
two
distinct
coats
the
under
coat
somewhat
soft
and
woolly
and
the
upper
hard
and
this
upper
coat
should
be
as
straight
as
possible
without
any
tendency
to
wave
or
curl
the
tail
is
not
very
long
and
should
be
nicely
feathered
and
in
repose
never
raised
above
the
level
of
the
back
the
same
description
applies
to
the
type
except
that
the
ears
in
repose
instead
of
being
carried
erect
fall
evenly
on
each
side
of
the
head
when
however
the
dog
is
excited
the
ears
are
pricked
forward
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
those
of
the
airedale
terrier
this
is
an
important
point
a
houndy
carriage
of
ear
being
a
decided
defect
the
variety
is
usually
the
heavier
and
larger
dog
of
the
two
and
for
some
reason
does
not
show
the
quality
and
breeding
of
its
neighbour
lately
however
there
has
evidently
been
an
effort
made
to
improve
the
type
with
the
result
that
some
very
excellent
dogs
have
recently
appeared
at
the
important
shows
probably
james
pratt
has
devoted
more
time
and
attention
to
the
skye
terrier
than
any
other
now
living
fancier
though
the
names
of
kidd
and
todd
are
usually
well
known
pratt
skyes
were
allied
to
the
type
of
terrier
claiming
to
be
the
original
skye
of
the
highlands
the
head
was
not
so
large
the
ears
also
were
not
so
heavily
feathered
as
is
the
case
in
the
skye
of
and
the
colours
were
very
varied
ranging
from
every
tint
between
black
and
white
in
a
great
impetus
was
given
to
the
breed
by
hughes
whose
kennels
at
wolverley
were
of
overwhelmingly
good
quality
hughes
was
quickly
followed
by
such
ardent
and
successful
fanciers
as
sir
claud
and
lady
alexander
of
ballochmyle
freeman
miss
bowyer
smyth
and
miss
mccheane
lately
other
prominent
exhibitors
have
forced
their
way
into
the
front
rank
among
whom
may
be
mentioned

xlii
the
yorkshire
terrier
the
most
devout
lover
of
this
charming
and
beautiful
terrier
would
fail
if
he
were
to
attempt
to
claim
for
him
the
distinction
of
descent
from
antiquity
bradford
and
not
babylon
was
his
earliest
home
and
he
must
be
candidly
acknowledged
to
be
a
very
modern
manufactured
variety
of
the
dog
yet
it
is
important
to
remember
that
it
was
in
yorkshire
that
he
was
made
yorkshire
where
live
the
cleverest
breeders
of
dogs
that
the
world
has
known
one
can
roughly
reconstitute
the
process
what
the
yorkshiremen
desired
to
make
for
themselves
was
a
pigmy
terrier
with
a
long
silky
silvery
grey
and
tan
coat
they
already
possessed
the
foundation
in
the
old
english
black
and
tan
terrier
to
lengthen
the
coat
of
this
working
breed
they
might
very
well
have
had
recourse
to
a
cross
with
the
skye
and
to
eliminate
the
wiry
texture
of
the
hair
a
further
cross
with
the
maltese
dog
would
impart
softness
and
silkiness
without
reducing
the
length
again
a
cross
with
the
clydesdale
which
was
then
assuming
a
fixed
type
would
bring
the
variety
yet
nearer
to
the
ideal
and
a
return
to
the
black
and
tan
would
tend
to
conserve
the
desired
colour
in
all
probability
the
dandie
dinmont
had
some
share
in
the
process
evidence
of
origin
is
often
to
be
found
more
distinctly
in
puppies
than
in
the
mature
dog
and
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
puppies
of
both
the
dandie
and
the
yorkshire
are
born
with
decided
black
and
tan
colouring
the
original
yorkshire
terrier
of
thirty
years
ago
was
often
called
a
scottish
terrier
or
even
a
skye
and
there
are
many
persons
who
still
confound
him
with
the
clydesdale
whom
he
somewhat
closely
resembles
at
the
present
time
he
is
classified
as
a
toy
dog
and
exhibited
almost
solely
as
such
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
until
very
lately
the
terrier
character
was
being
gradually
bred
out
of
him
and
that
the
perkiness
the
exuberance
and
gameness
which
once
distinguished
him
as
the
companion
of
the
yorkshire
operative
was
in
danger
of
being
sacrificed
to
the
desire
for
diminutive
size
and
inordinate
length
of
coat
perhaps
it
would
be
an
error
to
blame
the
breeders
of
yorkshire
terriers
for
this
departure
from
the
original
type
as
it
appeared
say
about
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
consideration
the
probability
that
what
is
now
called
the
working
variety
was
never
regarded
by
the
yorkshiremen
who
made
him
as
a
complete
and
finished
achievement
it
was
possibly
their
idea
at
the
very
beginning
to
produce
just
such
a
diminutive
dog
as
is
now
to
be
seen
in
its
perfection
at
exhibitions
glorying
in
its
flowing
tresses
of
steel
blue
silk
and
ruddy
gold
and
one
must
give
them
full
credit
for
the
patience
and
care
with
which
during
the
past
forty
years
they
have
been
steadily
working
to
the
fixed
design
of
producing
a
dwarfed
breed
which
should
excel
all
other
breeds
in
the
length
and
silkiness
of
its
robe
the
extreme
of
cultivation
in
this
particular
quality
was
reached
some
years
ago
by
troughear
whose
little
dog
conqueror
weighing
had
a
beautiful
enveloping
mantle
of
the
uniform
length
of
inches
doubtless
all
successful
breeders
and
exhibitors
of
the
yorkshire
terrier
have
their
little
secrets
and
their
peculiar
methods
of
inducing
the
growth
of
hair
they
regulate
the
diet
with
extreme
particularity
keeping
the
dog
lean
rather
than
fat
and
giving
him
nothing
that
they
would
not
themselves
eat
bread
mixed
with
green
vegetables
a
little
meat
and
gravy
or
fresh
fish
varied
with
milk
puddings
and
spratt
toy
pet
biscuits
should
be
the
staple
food
bones
ought
not
to
be
given
as
the
act
of
gnawing
them
is
apt
to
mar
the
beard
and
moustache
for
the
same
reason
it
is
well
when
possible
to
serve
the
food
from
the
fingers
but
many
owners
use
a
sort
of
mask
or
hood
of
elastic
material
which
they
tie
over
the
dog
head
at
to
hold
back
the
long
and
whiskers
that
would
otherwise
be
smeared
and
sullied
similarly
as
a
protection
for
the
coat
when
there
is
any
skin
irritation
and
an
inclination
to
scratch
linen
or
cotton
stockings
are
worn
upon
the
hind
feet
many
exhibitors
pretend
that
they
use
no
dressing
or
very
little
and
this
only
occasionally
for
the
jackets
of
their
yorkshire
terriers
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
continuous
use
of
grease
of
some
sort
is
not
only
advisable
but
even
necessary
opinions
differ
as
to
which
is
the
best
cosmetic
but
hairmero
the
dressing
prepared
for
the
purpose
by
miss
wilmer
of
yoxford
suffolk
could
not
easily
be
improved
upon
for
this
or
any
other
breed
for
the
full
display
of
their
beauty
yorkshire
terriers
depend
very
much
upon
careful
grooming
it
is
only
by
grooming
that
the
silvery
cascade
of
hair
down
the
dog
sides
and
the
beautiful
tan
that
flows
like
a
rain
of
gold
from
his
head
can
be
kept
perfectly
straight
and
free
from
curl
or
wrinkle
and
no
grease
or
pomade
even
if
their
use
were
officially
permitted
could
impart
to
the
coat
the
glistening
sheen
that
is
given
by
the
dexterous
application
of
the
brush
the
gentle
art
of
grooming
is
not
to
be
taught
by
theory
practice
is
the
best
teacher
but
the
novice
may
learn
much
by
observing
the
deft
methods
employed
by
an
expert
exhibitor
peter
eden
of
manchester
is
generally
credited
with
being
the
actual
inventor
of
the
yorkshire
terrier
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
earliest
breeders
and
owners
and
his
celebrated
albert
was
only
one
of
the
many
admirable
specimens
with
which
he
convinced
the
public
of
the
charms
of
this
variety
of
dog
he
may
have
given
the
breed
its
first
impulse
but
a
foster
of
bradford
was
for
many
years
the
head
and
centre
of
all
that
pertained
to
the
yorkshire
terrier
and
it
was
undoubtedly
she
who
raised
the
variety
to
its
highest
point
of
perfection
her
dogs
were
invariably
good
in

she
never

the
pomeranian
long
before
the
pomeranian
dog
was
common
in
great
britain
this
breed
was
to
be
met
with
in
many
parts
of
europe
especially
in
germany
and
he
was
known
under
different
names
according
to
his
size
and
the
locality
in
which
he
flourished
the
title
of
pomeranian
is
not
admitted
by
the
germans
at
all
who
claim
this
as
one
of
their
national
breeds
and
give
it
the
general
name
of
the
german
spitz
at
athens
in
the
street
of
tombs
there
is
a
representation
of
a
little
spitz
leaping
up
to
the
daughter
of
a
family
as
she
is
taking
leave
of
them
which
bears
the
date
equivalent
to
and
in
the
british
museum
there
is
an
ancient
bronze
jar
of
greek
workmanship
upon
which
is
engraved
a
group
of
winged
horses
at
whose
feet
there
is
a
small
dog
of
undoubted
pomeranian
type
the
date
is
the
second
century
it
is
now
generally
accepted
that
wherever
our
pomeranian
originated
he
is
a
northern
or
arctic
breed
evidence
goes
to
show
that
his
native
land
in
prehistoric
times
was
the
land
of
the
samoyedes
in
the
north
of
siberia
along
the
shores
of
the
arctic
ocean
the
samoyede
dog
is
being
gradually
introduced
into
england
and
good
specimens
can
be
frequently
seen
at
the
principal
shows
the
similarity
between
our
large
white
pomeranian
and
the
samoyede
is
too
great
to
be
accidental
and
we
are
drawn
to
the
conclusion
that
in
prehistoric
times
a
migration
of
the
samoyedes
was
made
from
their
native
land
into
pomerania
the
most
eastern
province
of
prussia
bordering
on
the
baltic
sea
and
that
these
people
took
with
them
their
dogs
which
were
the
progenitors
of
the
present
race
of
pomeranian
or
spitz
but
in
any
case
the
pomeranian
dog
so
called
has
been
a
native
of
various
parts
of
europe
from
very
early
times
his
advent
into
england
has
been
of
comparatively
recent
date
at
least
in
any
great
numbers
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
since
no
ancient
records
exist
on
this
question
gainsborough
however
painted
the
famous
actress
robinson
with
a
large
white
pomeranian
sitting
by
her
side
in
rees
published
in
a
good
picture
of
a
white
pomeranian
is
given
with
a
fairly
truthful
description
in
this
work
he
is
said
to
be
larger
than
the
common
sheep
dog
rees
gives
his
name
as
from
linnaeus
and
from
buffon
from
these
examples
therefore
we
may
infer
that
the
large
pomeranian
or
wolf
spitz
was
already
known
in
england
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
at
least
there
are
however
no
systematic
registers
of
pomeranians
prior
to
the
year
even
ten
years
later
than
this
last
date
so
little
was
the
breed
appreciated
that
a
writer
on
dogs
began
an
article
on
the
pomeranian
with
the
words
the
pomeranian
is
admittedly
one
of
the
least
interesting
dogs
in
existence
and
consequently
his
supporters
are
few
and
far
between
the
founders
of
the
kennel
club
held
their
first
dog
show
in
and
in
that
year
only
three
pomeranians
were
exhibited
for
the
next
twenty
years
little
or
no
permanent
increase
occurred
in
the
numbers
of
pomeranians
entered
at
the
chief
dog
show
in
england
the
largest
entry
took
place
in
when
there
were
fifteen
but
in
there
was
not
a
single
pomeranian
shown
from
this
time
however
the
numbers
rapidly
increased
commencing
in
with
fourteen
increasing
in
to
sixty
it
culminated
in
with
the
record
number
of
one
hundred
and
such
a
rapid
advance
between
the
years
and
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
dog
shows
although
it
is
right
to
add
that
this
extraordinarily
rapid
rise
into
popularity
has
since
been
equalled
in
the
case
of
the
now
fashionable
pekinese
this
tendency
to
advancement
in
public
favour
was
contemporaneous
with
the
formation
of
the
pomeranian
club
of
england
which
was
founded
in
and
through
its
fostering
care
the
pomeranian
has
reached
a
height
of
popularity
far
in
advance
of
that
attained
by
any
other
breed
of
toy
dog
one
of
the
first
acts
of
the
club
was
to
draw
up
a
standard
of
points
as
follows
appearance
the
pomeranian
should
be
a
compact
short
coupled
dog
well
knit
in
frame
he
should
exhibit
great
intelligence
in
his
expression
and
activity
and
buoyancy
in
his
deportment
head
and
nose
should
be
foxy
in
outline
or
the
skull
being
slightly
flat
large
in
proportion
to
the
muzzle
which
should
finish
rather
fine
and
free
from
lippiness
the
teeth
should
be
level
and
should
on
no
account
be
undershot
the
hair
on
the
head
and
face
should
be
smooth
and
the
nose
should
be
black
in
white
orange
and
sable
dogs
but
in
other
colours
may
be
self
but
never
or
white
ears
should
be
small
not
set
too
far
apart
nor
too
low
down
but
carried
perfectly
erect
like
those
of
a
fox
and
like
the
head
should
be
covered
with

eyes
should
be

apart
bright

in
the

must
be
fairly
deep
and
not

to
the

of
the
dog
legs
the

be
well
feathered
perfectly
straight
of
medium
length
and
not
such
as
would
be
termed
leggy
or

but
in
due
proportion
in

the

neither
contracted
nor

behind
the

small

shoulders
should
be
clean
and
well
laid
back
tail
the
tail
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the

and
should
be
turned
over
the

and
carried
flat
and
straight
being
profusely
covered
with

there
should

be
clad
with
long
hair
or
feathering
from
the
top
of
the

colour
all
whole

are
admissible
but
they
should
be
free
from
white

shadings
and
the
whites
must
be
quite
free
from
lemon
or
any
other
colour
a
few
white
hairs
in
any
of
the
self
colours
shall
not
necessarily
disqualify
at
present
the
whole
coloured
dogs
are
white
black
brown
light

dark
blue
as
pale
as

orange
which
should
be

and
even
in
colour
as

beaver
or
cream
dogs
other
than
white
with
white

leg
or

are
decidedly
objectionable
and
should
be
discouraged
and
can
not
compete
as
whole
coloured
specimens
in
dogs
the
colours
should
be
evenly
distributed
on
the
body
in
patches
a
dog
with
white

tan
feet
or

would
not
be
a

sables
should
be
shaded
throughout
with
three
or
more

as
uniformly
shaded
as
possible
with
no
patches
of

colour
in

the

if
in

they
are

be
given
to
the

where
classification
is
not
by

not

pomeranians

mixed
the
early
type
of
a
pomeranian
was
that
of
a
dog
varying
from
lb
or
lb
weight
up
to
lb
weight
or
even
more
and
some
few
of
about
lb
and
over
are
still
to
be
met
with
but
the
tendency
among
breeders
is
to
get
them
as
small
as
possible
so
that
diminutive
specimens
weighing
less
than
lb
are
now
quite
common
and
always
fetch
higher
prices
than
the
heavier
ones
the
dividing
weight
as
arranged
some
ten
years
ago
by
the
pomeranian
club
is
and
the
kennel
club
has
recently
divided
the
breed
into
two
classes
of
pomeranians
and
pomeranians
miniature
as
a
rule
the
white
specimens
adhere
more
nearly
to
the
primitive
type
and
are
generally
over
lb
in
weight
but
through
the
exertions
of
many
breeders
several
are
now
to
be
seen
under
this
limit
the
principal
breeders
of
this
colour
in
england
are
miss
hamilton
of
rozelle
miss
chell
miss
pope
and
the
first
two
whites
to
become
full
champions
under
kennel
club
rules
were
rob
of
rozelle
and
konig
of
rozelle
both
belonging
to
miss
hamilton
of
rozelle
more
black
pomeranians
have
been
bred
in
england
than
of
any
other
colour
and
during
the
last
fifteen
years
the
number
of
good
specimens
that
have
appeared
at
our
great
exhibitions
has
been
legion
there
do
not
seem
to
be
so
many
really
good
ones
as
heretofore
this
is
explained
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
other
colours
are
now
receiving
more
and
more
attention
from
breeders
a
typical
small
black
of
is
billie

the
property
of

stanley
mappin
he
scales
only
and
is
therefore
as
to
size
and
weight
as
well
as
shape
style
and
smartness
of
action
a
good
type
of
a
toy
pomeranian
he
was
bred
by
cates
and
is
the
winner
of
over
fifty
prizes
and
many
specials
to
enumerate
all
the
blacks

last
thirty

the

has
for
a
long
time
been
an
especial
favourite
with
the
public
and
many
good
ones
have
been
bred
during
the
last
ten
years
there
are
many
different
shades
of
browns
varying
from
a
dark
chocolate
to
a
light
beaver
but
in
all
cases
they
should
be
an
admirable
example
of
the
brown
pomeranians

the
incomparable

the

among
the
prettiest
of

the

enjoyed

unprecedented
popularity
the
growth
in
the
public
favour
among
all
classes
has
been
gradual
and
permanent

his

his
devotedness
to

his

the

in
the
fourth
chapter
of

of

read
of
king
charles
ii
that
he
might
be
seen
before
the
dew
was
off
the
grass
in
james
park
striding
among
the
trees
playing
with
his
spaniels
and
flinging

to

these
exhibitions
endeared
him
to
the
common
people
who
always
like
to
see
the
great
unbend

caius
described
these
little
spaniels
as
delicate
neate
and
pretty
kind
of
dogges
called
the
spaniel
gentle
or
the
comforter
and
further
said
these

away
the
treasure
of

from
their

but
featnesse
with

hath
neighbourhood
enough
there
would
appear
to
be
much
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
the
origin
of
this
breed
and
the
date
of
its
first
appearance
in
england
but
it
was
certainly
acclimatised
here
as
early
as
the
reign
of
henry
and
it
is
generally
thought
that
it
is
of
japanese
origin
taken
from
japan
to
spain
by
the
early
voyagers
to
the
east
and
thence
imported
into
england
the
english
toy
spaniels
of
especially
the
blenheim
variety
are
also
said
by
some
to
be
related
to
some
sporting
spaniels
which
belonged
to
queen
mary
about
the
year
and
might
have
been
brought
over
from
germany
mary
kept
a
pack
of
spaniels
for
hunting
purposes
there
is
another
theory
advanced
and
with
some
reason
that
the
english
toy
spaniel
of
the
present
day
derived
its
origin
from
the
cocker
spaniel
as
these
larger
dogs
have
the
same
colours
and
markings
black
and
tan
tricolour
and
red
and
white
the
cocker
also
occasionally
has
the
spot
on
the
forehead
which
is
a
characteristic
of
the
blenheim
be
the
origin
of
the
king
charles
spaniel
and
its
advent
in
this
country
what
it
may
king
charles
ii
so
much
indulged
and
loved
these
little
friends
that
they
followed
him
hither
and
thither
as
they
pleased
and
seem
to
have
been
seldom
separated
from
him
by
him
they
were
loved
and
cherished
and
brought
into
great
popularity
in
his
company
they
adorn
canvas
and
ancient
tapestries
and
are
reputed
to
have
been
allowed
free
access
at
all
times
to
whitehall
hampton
court
and
other
royal
palaces
there
are
now
four
recognised
varieties
of
the
english
toy
spaniel
or
more
properly
speaking
five
as
the
marlborough
blenheims
are
considered
a
distinct
type
the
latter
are
said
by
some
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
toy
spaniels
by
others
to
have
been
first
brought
over
from
spain
during
the
reign
of
charles
ii
by
john
churchill
first
duke
of
marlborough
from
whose
home
blenheim
palace
the
name
was
derived
and
has
ever
since
been
retained
if
we
may
take
the
evidence
of
vandyck
watteau
francois
boucher
and
greuze
in
whose
pictures
they
are
so
frequently
introduced
all
the
toy
spaniels
of
bygone
days
had
much
longer
noses
and
smaller
flatter
heads
than
those
of
the
present
time
and
they
had
much
longer
ears
these
in
many
instances
dragging
on
the
ground
the
marlborough
blenheim
has
retained
several
of
the
ancestral
points
although
this
variety
is
of
the
same
family
and
has
the
same
name
as
the
blenheim
of
the
present
day
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
two
types
the
marlborough
is
higher
on
the
legs
which
need
not
be
so
fully
feathered
he
has
a
much
longer
muzzle
and
a
flatter
and
more
contracted
skull
the
marlborough
possesses
many
of
the
attributes
of
a
sporting
spaniel
but
so
also
does
the
modern
blenheim
although
perhaps
in
a
lesser
degree
he
has
a
very
good
scent
rawdon
lee
states
that
the
blenheims
of
marlborough
were
excellent
dogs
to
work
the
coverts
for
cock
and
pheasant
and
that
excepting
in
colour
there
is
in
reality
not
much
difference
in
appearance
between
the
older
orange
and
white
dogs
not
as
they
are
with
their
abnormally
short
noses
round
skulls
and
enormous
eyes
and
the
liver
and
white
cockers
which
chalon
drew
for
daniel
in
this
will
bear
out
the
statement
that
the
smaller
type
of
spaniel
may
be
descended
from
the
cockers
the
ground
colour
of
this
dog
is
white
with
chestnut
encircling
the
ears
to
the
muzzle
the
sides
of
the
neck
are
chestnut
as
are
also
the
ears
there
is
a
white
blaze
on
the
forehead
in
the
centre
of
which
should
be
a
clear
chestnut
spot
called
the
beauty
spot
which
by
inbreeding
with
other
varieties
is
fast
being
lost
chestnut
markings
are
on
the
body
and
on
the
sides
of
the
the
coat
should
incline
to
be
curly
the
head
must
be
flat
not
broad
and
the
muzzle
should
be
straight
the
chestnut
should
be
of
a
rich
colour
the
four
varieties
the
king
charles
tricolour
or
as
he
has
been
called
charles
spaniel
the
modern
blenheim
and
the
ruby
have
all
the
same
points
differing
from
one
another
in
colour
only
and
the
following
description
of
the
points
as
determined
by
the
toy
spaniel
club
serves
for
all
head
should
be
well
domed
and
in
good
specimens
is
absolutely
sometimes
even
extending
beyond
the
and
projecting
over
the
eyes
so
as
nearly
to
meet
the
upturned
nose
eyes
the
eyes
are
set
wide
apart
with
the
eyelids
square
to
the
line
of
the
face
not
oblique
or
the
eyes
themselves
are
large
and
dark
as
possible
so
as
to
be
generally
considered
black
their
enormous
pupils
which
are
absolutely
of
that
colour
increasing
the
description
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
weeping
shown
at
the
inner
angles
this
is
owing
to
a
defect
in
the
lachrymal
duct
stop
the
stop
or
hollow
between
the
eyes
is
well
marked
as
in
the
bulldog
or
even
more
so
some
good
specimens
exhibit
a
hollow
deep
enough
to
bury
a
small
marble
nose
the
nose
must
be
short
and
well
turned
up
between
the
eyes
and
without
any
indication
of
artificial
displacement
afforded
by
a
deviation
to
either
side
the
colour
of
the
end
should
be
black
and
it
should
be
both
deep
and
wide
with
open
nostrils
jaw
the
muzzle
must
be
square
and
deep
and
the
lower
jaw
wide
between
the
branches
leaving
plenty
of
space
for
the
tongue
and
for
the
attachment
of
the
lower
lips
which
should
completely
conceal
the
teeth
it
should
also
be
turned
up
or
finished
so
as
to
allow
of
its
meeting
the
end
of
the
upper
jaw
turned
up
in
a
similar
way
as
above
described
ears
the
ears
must
be
long
so
as
to
approach
the
ground
in
an
dog
they
measure
twenty
inches
from
tip
to
tip
and
some
reach
inches
or
even
a
trifle
more
they
should
be
set
low
on
the
head
hang
flat
to
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
be
heavily
feathered
in
this
last
respect
the
king
charles
is
expected
to
exceed
the
blenheim
and
his
ears
occasionally
extend
to
inches
size
the
most
desirable
size
is
indicated
by
the
accepted
weight
of
from
lb
to
lb
shape
in
compactness
of
shape
these
spaniels
almost
rival
the
pug
but
the
length
of
coat
adds
greatly
to
the
apparent
bulk
as
the
body
when
the
coat
is
wetted
looks
small
in
comparison
with
that
dog
still
it
ought
to
be
decidedly
cobby
with
strong
stout
legs
short
broad
back
and
wide
chest
the
symmetry
of
the
king
charles
is
of
importance
but
it
is
seldom
that
there
is
any
defect
in
this
respect
coat
the
coat
should
be
long
silky
soft
and
wavy
but
not
curly
in
the
blenheim
there
should
be
a
profuse
mane
extending
well
down
in
the
front
of
the
chest
the
feather
should
be
well
displayed
on
the
ears
and
feet
and
in
the
latter
case
so
thickly
as
to
give
the
appearance
of
their
being
webbed
it
is
also
carried
well
up
the
backs
of
the
legs
in
the
black
and
tan
the
feather
on
the
ears
is
very
long
and
profuse
exceeding
that
of
the
blenheim
by
an
inch
or
more
the
feather
on
the
tail
which
is
cut
to
the
length
of
three
and
a
half
to
four
inches
should
be
silky
and
from
five
to
six
inches
in
length
constituting
a
marked
flag
of
a
square
shape
and
not
carried
above
the
level
of
the
back

the
colour
differs
with
the
variety
the
black
and
tan
is
a
rich
glossy
black
and
deep
mahogany
tan
tan
spots
over
the
eyes
and
the
usual
markings
on
the
muzzle
chest
and
legs
are
also
required
the
ruby
is
a
rich
chestnut
red
and
is
the
presence
of
a
white

with
the
on
the
chest
of

with
the

shall
not

disqualify
but
a
white
patch
on
the
chest
or
white
on
any
other
part
of
a
black
and
tan
or
ruby
spaniel
shall
be
a
disqualification
the
blenheim
must
on
no
account
be
but
should
have
a
ground
of
pure
pearly
white
with
bright
rich
chestnut
or
ruby
red
markings
evenly
distributed
in
large
patches
the
ears
and
cheeks
should
be
red
with
a
blaze
of
white
extending
from
the
nose
up
the
forehead
and
ending
between
the
ears
in
a
crescentic
curve
in
the
centre
of
this
blaze
at
the
top
of
the
forehead
there
should
be
a
clear
spot
of
red
of
the
size
of
a
sixpence
tan
ticks
on
the
and
on
the
white
muzzle
are
desirable
the
tricolour
should
in
part
have
the
tan
of
the
black
and
tan
with
markings
like
the
blenheim
in
black
instead
of
red
on
a
ground
the
ears
and
under
the
tail
should
also
be
lined
with
tan
the
tricolour
has
no
spot
that
beauty
being
peculiarly
the
property
of
the
blenheim
the
all
red
king
charles
is
known
by
the
name
of
ruby
spaniel
the
colour
of
the
nose
is
black
the
points
of
the
ruby
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
black
and
tan
differing
only
in
colour
the
king
charles
variety
used
to
consist
of
black
and
tan
and
black
and
white
spaniels
and
it
is
thought
that
by
the
of
the
two
specimens
the
tricolour
was
produced
the
colour
of
the
king
charles
now
is
a
glossy
black
with
rich
mahogany
tan
spots
over
the
eyes
and
on
the
cheeks
there
should
also
be
some
tan
on
the
legs
and
under
the
tail
the
prince
charles
or
tricolour
should
have
a
ground
with
glossy
black
markings
evenly
distributed
over
the
body
in
patches
the
ears
should
be
lined
with
tan
tan
must
also
be
seen
over
the
eyes
and
some
on
the
cheeks
under
the
tail
also
tan
must
appear
the
blenheim
must
also
have
a
ground
with
bright
rich
chestnut
or
ruby
red
markings
evenly
distributed
in
patches
over
the
body
the
ears
and
cheeks
must
be
red
and
a
white
blaze
should
stretch
from
the
nose
to
the
forehead
and
thence
in
a
curve
between
the
ears
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
there
should
be
on
the
white
blaze
a
clear
red
spot
about
the
size
of
a
sixpence
this
is
called
the
blenheim
spot
which
as
well
as
the
profuse
mane
adds
greatly
to
the
beauty
of
this
particular
toy
spaniel
unfortunately
in
a
litter
of
blenheims
the
spot
is
often
wanting
the
ruby
spaniel
is
of
one
colour
a
rich
unbroken
red
the
nose
is
black
there
are
now
some
very
beautiful
specimens
of
ruby
spaniels
but
it
is
only
within
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
that
this
variety
has
existed
it
seems
to
have
originally
appeared
in
a
litter
of
king
charles
puppies
when
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
freak
of
nature
taking
for
its
entire
colour
only
the
tan
markings
and
losing
the
black
ground
the
different
varieties
of
toy
spaniels
have
been
so
much
interbred
that
a
litter
has
been
reputed
to
contain
the
four
kinds
but
this
would
be
of
very
rare
occurrence
the
blenheim
is
now
often
crossed
with
the
tricolour
when
the
litter
consist
of
puppies
quite
true
to
the
two
types
the
crossing
of
the
king
charles
with
the
ruby
is
also
attended
with
very
good
results
the
tan
markings
on
the
king
charles
becoming
very
bright
and
the
colour
of
the
ruby
also
being
improved
neither
of
these
specimens
should
be
crossed
with
either
the
blenheim
or
the
tricolour
as
white
must
not
appear
in
either
the
king
charles
or
the
ruby
spaniel
it
is
regretted
by
some
of
the
admirers
of
these
dogs
that
custom
has
ordained
that
their
tails
should
be
docked
as
portrayed
in
early
pictures
of
the
king
charles
and
the
blenheim
varieties
the
tails
are
long
well
flagged
and
inclined
to
curve
gracefully
over
the
back
and
in
none
of
the
pictures
of
the
supposed
ancestors
of
our
present
toy
spaniels
even
so
recent
as
those
painted
by
sir
edwin
landseer
do
we
find
an
absence
of
the
long
tail
if
left
intact
the
tail
would
take
two
or
three
years
to
attain
perfection
but
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
dog
generally
which
improves
very
much
with
age
and
is
not
at
its
best
until
it
is
three
years
old
and
even
then
continues
to
improve
although
the
toy
spaniels
are
unquestionably
true
aristocrats
by
nature
birth
and
breeding
and
are
most
at
home
in
a
or
on
a
lawn
they
are
by
no
means
deficient
in
sporting
proclivities
and
in
spite
of
their
short
noses
their
scent
is
very
keen
they
thoroughly
enjoy
a
good
scamper
and
are
all
the
better
for
not
being
too
much
pampered
they
are
very
good
intelligent
and
affectionate
and
have
sympathetic
coaxing
little
ways
one
point
in
their
favour
is
the
fact
that
they
are
not
noisy
and
do
not
yap
continually
when
strangers
go
into
a
room
where
they
are
or
at
other
times
as
is
the
habit
with
some
breeds
of
toy
dogs
those
who
have
once
had
king
charles
spaniels
as
pets
seldom
care
to
replace
them
by
any
other
variety
of
dog
fearing
lest
they
might
not
find
in
another
breed
such
engaging
little
friends
and
companions
gentle
as
of
yore
and
also
comforters
although
these
dogs
need
care
they
possess
great
powers
of
endurance
they
appreciate
warmth
and
comfort
but
do
not
thrive
so
well
in
either
extreme
heat
or
intense
cold
one
thing
to
be
avoided
is
the
wetting
of
their
feathered
feet
or
should
this
happen
allowing
them
to
remain
so
and
as
in
the
case
of
all
dogs
with
long
ears
the
interior
of
the
ears
should
be
carefully
kept
dry
to
avoid
the
risk
of
canker
in
going
back
to
a
period
long
before
the
last
century
was
through
we
find
that
a
great
number
of
these
ornamental
pets
were
in
the
hands
of
working
men
living
in
the
east
end
of
london
and
the
competition
among
them
to
own
the
best
was
very
keen
they
held
miniature
dog
shows
at
small
taverns
and
paraded
their
dogs
on
the
sanded
floor
of
their
owners
sitting
around
smoking
long
pipes
the
value
of
good
specimens
in
those
early
days
appears
to
have
been
from
to
which
latter
sum
is
said
to
have
been
refused
by
a
comparatively
poor
man
for
a
small
black
and
tan

very
long
ears
and
a
nose
much
too
long
for
our
fancy
among
the
names
of
some
old
prominent
breeders
and
exhibitors
may
be
mentioned
those
of

j
buggs
and
forder
it
is
interesting
to
note
on
looking
over
a
catalogue
of
the
kennel
club
show
that
in
the
classes
for
toy
spaniels
numbered
five
with
two
championship
prizes
one
each
for
blenheims
and
black
and
tans
and
the
total
entries
were
at
this
date
neither
tricolours
nor
rubies
were
recognised
as
a
separate
variety
by
the
kennel
club
and
they
had
no
place
in
the
register
of
breeds
until
the
year
at
the
kennel
club
show
in
classes
were
provided
and
eight
challenge
certificate
prizes
were
given
the
entries
numbering
the
formation
of
the
toy
spaniel
club
in
and
the
impetus
given
to
breeders
and
exhibitors
by
the
numerous
shows
with
good
classification
have
caused
this
beautiful
breed
to
become
more
popular
year

fifty

the

with
the
notion
that
a

the

bred

when

are
purchasing
a

with

intention
of
breeding
many
inquiries
should
be
made
as
to
the
stock
from
which
she
comes
this
will
influence
the
selection
of
the
sire
to
whom
she
is
to
be
mated
and
he
should
excel
in
the
points
in
which
she
is
deficient
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
perfectly
healthy
animals
and
if
the
female
be
young
and
small
stock
is
desired
her
mate
should
be
several
years
her
senior
a
plain
specimen
of
the
right
blood
is
quite
likely
to
produce
good
results
to
the
breeder
for
example
should
there
be
two
female
puppies
in
a
litter
one
remarkable
as
promising
to
have
all
the
requirements
for
a
coming
champion
the
other
large
and
plain
this
latter
should
be
selected
for
breeding
purposes
as
being
stronger
she
will
make
a
better
and
more
useful
mother
than
her
handsome
sister
who
should
be
kept
for
exhibition
or
for
sale
at
a
remunerative
price
the
modern
craze
for
small
specimens
makes
them
quite
unsuitable
for
procreation
a
brood
bitch
should
not
be
less
than
lb
in
weight
and
even
heavier
is
preferable
a
sire
the
same
size
will
produce
small
and
far
more
typical
stock
than
one
of
lb
or
as
the
tendency
is
to
degenerate
especially
in
head
points
but
small
size
can
be
obtained
by
suitably
selecting
the
parents
the
early
spring
is
the
best
season
for
breeding
as
it
gives
the
puppies
a
start
of
at
least
six
months
in
which

grow
and
get
strong

the
cold
weather

although
of
course
they
can

any
time

autumn
and

puppies
are
more
troublesome

it
is
always
wise
to
administer
occasionally
both
to
puppies
and
adults
a
dose
of
worm
medicine
so
as
to
give
no
chance
to
internal
parasites
the
most
troublesome
ill
with
which
the
dog
owner
has
to
wrestle
causing
even
more
mortality
than
the
dreaded
scourge
of
distemper
the
rules
of
hygiene
can
not
be
overlooked
as
upon
them
hangs
the
success
of
the
breeder
plenty
of
fresh

light
and
sunshine
are
as
necessary
as

puppies
of
this
breed
are
essentially
delicate
and
must
be
kept
free
from
cold
and
draughts
but
they
require
liberty
and
freedom
to
develop
and
strengthen
their

otherwise
they
are
liable
to
develop
rickets

the
pekinese
and
the
japanese
few
of
the
many
breeds
of
foreign
dogs
now
established
in
england
have
attained
such
a
measure
of
popularity
in
so
short
a
time
as
the
pekinese
of
their
early
history
little
is
known
beyond
the
fact
that
at
the
looting
of
the
summer
palace
of
pekin
in
bronze
effigies
of
these
dogs
known
to
be
more
than
two
thousand
years
old
were
found
within
the
sacred
precincts
the
dogs
were
and
are
to
this
day
jealously
guarded
under
the
supervision
of
the
chief
eunuch
of
the
court
and
few
have
ever
found
their
way
into
the
outer
world
so
far
as
the
writer
is
aware
the
history
of
the
breed
in
england
dates
from
the
importation
in
of
five
dogs
taken
from
the
summer
palace
where
they
had
no
doubt
been
forgotten
on
the
flight
of
the
court
to
the
interior
admiral
lord
john
hay
who
was
present
on
active
service
gives
a
graphic
account
of
the
finding
of
these
little
dogs
in
a
part
of
the
garden
frequented
by
an
aunt
of
the
emperor
who
had
committed
suicide
on
the
approach
of
the
allied
forces
lord
john
and
another
naval
officer
a
cousin
of
the
late
duchess
of
richmond
each
secured
two
dogs
the
fifth
was
taken
by
general
dunne
who
presented
it
to
queen
victoria
lord
john
took
pains
to
ascertain
that
none
had
found
their
way
into
the
french
camp
and
he
heard
then
that
the
others
had
all
been
removed
to
jehal
with
the
court
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
suppose
that
these
five
were
the
only
palace
dogs
or
sacred
temple
dogs
of
pekin
which
reached
england
and
it
is
from
the
pair
which
lived
to
a
respectable
old
age
at
goodwood

of

that

are
rigidly
guarded

that
their
theft
is
punishable
by
death

the

of

were
found

to

such
as
the

wharncliffe
lady
dorothy

and
others
but
in
those
days
the
pekinese
was
practically
an
unknown
quantity
and
it
can
therefore
be
more
readily
understood
what
interest
was
aroused
about
eleven
years
ago
by
the
appearance
of
a
small
dog
similar
in
size
colour
and
general
type
to
those
so
carefully
cherished
at
goodwood
this
proved
to
be
none
other
than
the
since
sire
ah
cum
owned
by
douglas
murray
whose
husband
having
extensive
interests
in
china
had
managed
after
many
years
to
secure
a
true
palace
dog
smuggled
in
a
box
of
hay
placed
inside
a
crate
which
contained

marland

and

it
must
however
be
clearly
admitted
that
since
the
popularity
of
the
breed
has
become
established
we
unluckily
see
scores
of
pekinese
in
the
who
have
lost
all
resemblance
to
the
original
type
and
for
this
the
pekinese
club
is
in
some
measure
to
blame
the
original
points
for
the
guidance
of
breeders
and
judges
were
drawn
up
by
lady
samuelson
douglas
murray
and
lady
algernon
who
fixed
the
maximum
size
at
a
very
generous
margin
since
then
the

has
amended
the
scale
of
points
no
doubt
in
order
to
secure
a
larger
membership
and
the
maximum
now
stands
at
lb
is
it
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
confusion
exists
as
to
what
is
the
true
type
at
shows
there
should
be
two
distinct
classes
the
palace
dog
and
the
pekin

any
other
name
which
would
enable
the

lady
algernon
has
occasionally
been
criticised
for
her
advocacy
of
specimens
but
in
support
of
this
preference
it
can
be
proved
that
the
original
pair
brought
to
goodwood
as
well
as
murray
ah
cum
were
all
of
the
golden
chestnut
shade
and
as
no
brindled
or
black
dog
has
ever
been
born
at
goodwood
or
broughton
we
have
some
authority
for
looking
upon
as
an
important
point
this
view
was
in
the
first
place
confirmed
by
the
late
chinese
ambassador
in
london
and
further
by
baron
speck
von
sternberg
who
was
for
many
years
minister
at
pekin
and
had
very
special
facilities
for
noting
the
points
of
the
palace
dogs
in
every
case
a
black
muzzle
is
indispensable
also
black
points
to
the
ears
with
trousers
tail
and
feathering
a
somewhat
lighter
shade
than
the
body
there
is
considerable
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
the
penalisation
of
what
in
other
breeds
is
known
as
a
dudley
nose
but
on
this
point
there
must
be
some
difficulty
at
shows
in
the
pekinese
the
colour
of
the
nose
varies
in
a
remarkable
way
especially
in
the
case
of
the
bitches
for
instance
a
pinkish
tinge
was
always
visible
on
the
nose
of
goodwood
meh
before
the
birth
of
her
puppies
but
it
resumed
its
normal
colour
when
the
puppies
were
a
few
weeks
old
as
a
representative
type
of
alderbourne
resembles
most
nearly
the
old
goodwood
dogs
he
has
the
same
square
cobby
appearance
broad
chest
bowed
legs
profuse
feather
and
large
lustrous
eyes
points
which
are
frequently
looked
for
in
vain
nowadays
and
his
breeder
and
owner
may
well
be
proud
of
him
the
pekinese
differs
from
the
japanese
dog
in
that
it
appears
to
be
far
stronger
in
constitution
and
withstands
the
changes
of
the
english
climate
with
much
greater
ease
in
fact
they
are
as
hardy
healthy
as
any
english
breed
and
the
only
serious
trouble
seems
to
be
the
weakness
which
is
developing
in
the
eyes
small
abscesses
frequently
appear
when
the
puppies
are
a
few
months
old
and
although
they
may
not
affect
the
sight
they
almost
inevitably
leave
a
bluish
mark
while
in
some
cases
the
eye
itself
becomes
contracted
whether
this
is
one
of
the
results
of
it
is
difficult
to
say
and
it
would
be
of
interest
to
know
whether
the
same
trouble
is
met
with
in
china
the
pekinese
bitches
are
excellent
mothers
provided
they
are
not
interfered
with
for
the
first
few
days
this
was
discovered
at
goodwood
years
ago
by
the
fact
that
on
two
or
three
occasions
one
celestial
lady
who
had
been
given
greater
attention
than
she
considered
necessary
revenged
herself
by
devouring
her
own
family
of
puppies
one
thing
seems
from
experience
to
be
especially
advisable
as
far
as
can
be
arranged
to
breed
in
the
spring
rather
than
autumn
the
puppies
need
all
the
open
air
and
exercise
that
is
possible
and
where
rickety
specimens
are
so
frequently
met
with
it
is
only
natural
that
a
puppy
who
starts
life
with
the
summer
months
ahead
is
more
likely
to
develop
well
than
one
born
in
the
autumn
great
attention
should
be
paid
with
reference
to
the
frequent
almost
certain
presence
of
worms
which
trouble
seems
more
prevalent
with
pekinese
than
with
any
other
breed
wherever
possible
fish
should
be
given
as
part
of
the
dietary
some
pekinese
devour
it
with
relish
others
will
not
touch
it
but
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
a
useful
item
in
the
bill
of
fare
bread
well
soaked
in
very
strong
stock
sheep
head
and
liver
are
always
better
as
regular
diet
than
meat
but
in
cases
of
debility
a
little
raw
meat
given
once
a
day
is
most
beneficial
it
would
not
be
fitting
to

an
article
on
pekinese
without
bearing
testimony
to
their
extraordinarily
attractive
characteristics
they
are
intensely
affectionate
and
faithful
and
have
something
almost
in
their
domesticity
they
display
far
more
character
than
the
toy
dog
usually
does
and
for
this
reason
it
is
that
pains
should
be
taken
to
preserve
the
true
type
in
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
quality
is
more
essential
than
quantity
as
their
implies
these
tiny
black
and
white
lap
dogs
are
reputed
to
be
natives
of
the
land
of
the
chrysanthemum
the
japanese
who
have
treasured
them
for
centuries
have
the
belief
that
they
are
not
less
ancient
than
the
dogs
of
malta
there
seems
to
be
a
probability
however
that
the
breed
may
claim
to
be
chinese
just
as
surely
as
japanese
the
hon
mclaren
morrison
an
authority
on
exotic
dogs
whose
opinion
must
always
be
taken
with
respect
is
inclined
to
the
belief
that
they
are
related
to
the
spaniels
of
thibet
while
other
experts
are
equally
of
opinion
that
the
variety
is
an
offshoot
from
the
spaniels
of
pekin
it
is
fairly
certain
that
they
are
indigenous
to
the
far
east
whence
we
have
derived
so
many
of
our
small
and
pets
the
oriental
peoples
have
always
bred
their
lap
dogs
to
small
size
convenient
for
carrying
in
the
sleeve
the
sleeve
dog
and
the
chin
dog
are
common
and
appropriate
appellations
in
the
east
the
japanese
spaniel
was
certainly
known
in
england
half
a
century
ago
and
probably
much
earlier
our
seamen
often
brought
them
home
as
presents
for
their
sweethearts
these
early
imported
specimens
were
generally
of
the
larger
kind
and
if
they
were
bred
from
which
is
doubtful
it
was
by
crossing
with
the
already
king
charles
or
blenheim
spaniels
their
colours
were
not
invariably
white
and
black
many
were
white
and
red
or
white
with
patches
the
colouring
other
than
white
was
usually
about
the
ears
and
the
crown
of
the
head
with
a
line
of
white
running
from
the
point
of
the
snub
black
nose
between
the
eyes
as
far
as
the
occiput
this
blaze
up
the
face
was
commonly
said
to
resemble
the
body
of
a
butterfly
whose
closed
wings
were
represented
by
the
dog
expansive
ears
the
white
and
black
colouring
is
now
the
most
frequent
the
points
desired
are
a
broad
and
rounded
skull
large
in
proportion
to
the
dog
body
a
wide
strong
muzzle
and
a
lower
jaw
great
length
of
body
is
not
good
the
back
should
be
short
and
level
the
legs
are
by
preference
slender
and
much
feathered
the
feet
large
and
well
separated
an
important
point
is
the
coat
it
should
be
abundant
particularly
about
the
neck
where
it
forms
a
ruffle
and
it
ought
to
be
quite
straight
and
very
silky
the
japanese
spaniel
is
constitutionally
delicate
requiring
considerable
care
in
feeding
a
frequent
almost
a
daily
change
of
diet
is
to
be
recommended
and
manufactured
foods
are
to
be
avoided
rice
usually
agrees
well
fresh
fish
sheep
head
tongue
chicken
livers
milk
or
batter
puddings
are
also
suitable
and
occasionally
give
oatmeal
porridge
alternated
with
a
little
scraped
raw
meat
as
an
especial
favour
for
puppies
newly
weaned
it
is
well
to
limit
the
supply
of
milk
foods
and
to
avoid
red
meat
finely
minced
rabbit
or

are
better
of

there
has
lately
been
a
tendency
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
diminutive
size
in
this
variety
of
the
dog
to
the
neglect
of
limbs
and
free
movement
but
on
the
whole
it
may
be
stated
with
confidence
that
the
japanese
is
prospering
in
england
thanks
largely
to
the
energetic
work
of
the
japanese

was
formed
some
three

chapter
xlvi
the
maltese
dog
and
the
pug
no
doubt
has
been
cast
upon
the
belief
that
the
small
white
silky
is
the
most
ancient
of
all
the
lap
dogs
of
the
western
world
it
was
a
favourite
in
the
time
of
phidias
it
was
an
especial
pet
of
the
great
ladies
of
imperial
rome
it
appears
to
have
come
originally
from
the
adriatic
island
of
melita
rather
than
from
the
mediterranean
malta
although
this
supposition
can
not
be
verified
there
is
however
no
question
that
it
is
of
european
origin
and
that
the
breed
as
we
know
it
has
altered
exceedingly
little
in
type
and
size
since
it
was
alluded
to
by
aristotle
more
than
three
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
one
may
gather
from
various
references
in
literature
and
from
the
evidence
of
art
that
it
was
highly
valued
in
ancient
times
when
his
favourite
dog
dies
wrote
theophrastus
in
illustration
of
the
vain
man
he
deposits
the
remains
in
a
tomb
and
erects
a
monument
over
the
grave
with
the
inscription
of
the
stock
of
malta
the
offspring
of
the
stock
of
malta
were
probably
first
imported
into
england
during
the
reign
of
henry
viii
it
is
certain
that
they
were
regarded
as
meet
playfellows
for
mincing
mistresses
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
whose
physician
caius
alluded
to
them
as
being
distinct
from
the
spaniel
gentle
or
comforter
early
writers
aver
that
it
was
customary
when
maltese
puppies
were
born
to
press
or
twist
the
nasal
bone
with
the
fingers
in
order
that
they
may
seem
more
elegant
in
the
sight
of
men
a
circumstance
which
goes
to
show
that
our
forefathers
were
not
averse
to
improving
artificially
the
points
of
their
dogs
the
snowy
whiteness
and
soft
silky
texture
of
its
coat
must
always
cause
the
maltese
dog
to
be
admired
but
the
variety
has
never
been
commonly
kept
in
england
a
fact
which
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
difficulty
of
breeding
it
and
to
the
trouble
in
keeping
the
dog
long
jacket
clean
and
free
from
tangle
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
it
was
more
popular
as
a
lap
dog
than
it
has
ever
been
since
and
in
the
early
days
of
dog
shows
many
beautiful
specimens
were
exhibited
this
popularity
was
largely
due
to
the
efforts
of
mandeville
of
southwark
who
has
been
referred
to
as
virtually
the
founder
of
the
modern
maltese
his
fido
and
lily
were
certainly
the
most
perfect
representatives
of
the
breed
during
the
decade
between
and
and
at
the
shows
held
at
birmingham
islington
the
crystal
palace
and
cremorne
gardens
this
beautiful
brace
was
unapproachable
it
is
a
breed
which
to
be
kept
in
perfection
requires
more
than
ordinary
attention
not
only
on
account
of
its
silky
jacket
which
is
peculiarly
liable
to
become
matted
and
is
difficult
to
keep
absolutely
clean
without
frequent
washing
but
also
on
account
of
a
somewhat
delicate
constitution
the
maltese
being
susceptible
to
colds
and
chills
if
affected
by
such
causes
the
eyes
are
often
attacked
and
the
water
running
from
them
induces
a
brown
stain
to
mar
the
beauty
of
the
face
skin
eruptions
due
to
unwise
feeding
or
parasites
due
to
uncleanliness
are
quickly
destructive
to
the
silky
coat
and
constant
watchfulness
is
necessary
to
protect
the
dog
from
all
occasion
for
scratching
the
diet
is
an
important
consideration
always
and
a
nice
discernment
is
imperative
in
balancing
the
proportions
of
meat
and
vegetable
too
much
meat
is
prone
to
heat
the
blood
while
too
little
induces
eczema
scraps
of
bread
and
green
vegetables
well
mixed
with
gravy
and
lean
meat
form
the
best
dietary
for
the
principal
meal
of
the
day
and
plenty
of
exercise
is
imperative
the
following
is
the
standard
description
and
points
of
the
maltese
club
of
london

not
be

should
be
of

not

condition
and

the

should
not

in

way
size
the
most
approved
weights
should
be
from

to
the
smaller
the
better
but
it
is
desirable
that
they
should
not
exceed
lb
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
pug
enjoys
the
antiquity
of
descent
that
is
attached
to
the
greyhound
the
maltese
dog
and
some
few
other
venerable
breeds
although
much
has
been
written
on
the
origin
of
these
dogs
nothing
authentic
has
been
discovered
in
connection
with
it
statements
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
to
the
effect
that
the
pug
was
brought
into
this
country
from
holland
in
the
early
years
of
the
last
century
it
was
commonly
styled
the
dutch
pug
but
this
theory
does
not
trace
the
history
far
enough
back
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
at
that
period
the
dutch
east
india
company
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
far
east
others
declare
that
muscovy
was
the
original
home
of
the
breed
a
supposition
for
which
there
is
no
discernible
foundation
the
study
of
canine
history
receives
frequent
enlightenment
from
the
study
of
the
growth
of
commercial
intercourse
between
nations
and
the
trend
of
events
would
lead
one
to
the
belief
that
the
pug
had
its
origin
in
china
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
with
that
country
that
most
of
the
toy
dogs
with
tails
curled
over
their
backs
are
associated
the
pug
was
brought
into
prominence
in
great
britain
about
sixty
years
ago
by
lady
willoughby
de
eresby
of
grimthorpe
near
lincoln
and
morrison
of
walham
green
who
each
independently
established
a
kennel
of
these
dogs
with
such
success
that
eventually
the
fawn
pugs
were
spoken
of
as
either
the
willoughby
or
the
morrison
pugs
at
that
period
the
black
variety
was
not
known
the
willoughby
pug
was
duller
in
colour
than
the
morrison
which
was
of
a
brighter
ruddier
hue
but
the
two
varieties
have
since
been
so
much
interbred
that
they
are
now
undistinguishable
and
the
fact
that
they
were
ever
familiarly
recognised
as
either
willoughbys
or
morrisons
is
almost
entirely
forgotten
a
fawn
pug
may
now
be
either
silver
grey
or
apricot
and
equally
valuable
whatever
may
have
been
the
history
of
the
pug
as
regards
its
nativity
it
had
not
been
long
introduced
into
england
before
it
became
a
popular
favourite
as
a
pet
and
it
shared
with
the
king
charles
spaniel
the
affection
of
the
great
ladies
of
the
land
the
late
queen
victoria
possessed
one
of
which
she
was
very
proud
the
pug
has
however
now
fallen
from
his
high
estate
as
a
ladies
pet
and
his
place
has
been
usurped
by
the
toy
pomeranian
the
pekinese
and
japanese
all
of
which
are
now
more
highly
thought
of
in
the
or
boudoir
but
the
pug
has
an
advantage
over
all
these
dogs
as
from
the
fact
that
he
has
a
shorter
coat
he
is
cleaner
and
does
not
require
so
much
attention
it
was
not
until
the
establishment
of
the
pug
dog
club
in
that
a
fixed
standard
of
points
was
drawn
up
for
the
guidance
of
judges
when
awarding
the
prizes
to
pugs
later
on
the
london
and
provincial
pug
club
was
formed
and
standards
of
points
were
drawn
up
by
that
society
these
however
have
never
been
adhered
to
the
weight
of
a
dog
or
bitch
according
to
the
standard
should
be
from
lb
to
but
there
are
very
few
dogs
indeed
that
are
winning
prizes
who
can
draw
the
scale
at
the
maximum
weight
one
of
the
most
distinctive
features
of
a
fawn
pug
is
the
trace
which
is
a
line
of
black
running
along
the
top
of
the
back
from
the
occiput
to
the
tail
it
is
the
exception
to
find
a
fawn
pug
with
any
trace
at
all
now
the
muzzle
should
be
short
blunt
but
not
upfaced
most
of
the
winning
pugs
of
the
present
day
are
undershot
at
least
half
an
inch
and
consequently
must
be
upfaced
only
one
champion
of
the
present
day
possesses
a
level
mouth
the
should
be
black
according
to
the
standard
but
this
point
is
ignored
altogether
in
fact
the
standard
as
drawn
up
by
the
club
should
be
completely
revised
for
it
is
no
true
guide
the
colour
which
should
be
either
silver
or
apricot
fawn
the
markings
on
the
head
which
should
show
a
or
diamond
on
the
forehead
together
with
the
orthodox
size
are
not
now
taken
into
consideration
and
the
prizes
are
given
to
dogs
with
big
skulls
that
are
patchy
in
colour
and
the
charming
little
pugs
which
were
once
so
highly
prized
are
now
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
while
the
large
lustrous
eyes
so
sympathetic
in
their
expression
are
seldom
seen
the
black
pug
is
a
recent
production
he
was
brought
into
notice
in
when
lady
brassey
exhibited
some
at
the
maidstone
show
by
whom
he
was
manufactured
is
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
as
with
the
fawn
pug
in
existence
there
was
not
much
difficulty
in
crossing
it
with
the
black
dog
of
small
size
that
could
be
found
and
then
back
again
to
the
fawn
and
the
thing
was
done
fawn
and
black
pugs
are
continually
being
bred
together
and
as
a
rule
if
judgment
is
used
in
the
selection
of
suitable
crosses
the
puppies
are
sound
in
colour
whether
fawn
or
black
in
every
respect
except
markings
the
black
pug
should
be
built
on
the
same
lines
as
the
fawn
and
be
a
cobby
little
dog
with
short
back
and
wide
in

with

and
blunt

the
brussels
griffon
away
back
in
the
numbers
of
miners
in
yorkshire
and
the
midlands
are
said
to
have
possessed
little
and
red
dogs
which
accompanied
their
owners
to
work
being
stowed
away
in
pockets
of
overcoats
until
the
dinner
hour
when
they
were
brought
out
to
share
their
masters
meals
perchance
chasing
a
casual
rat
in
between
times
old
men
of
who
remember
these
little
red
tarriers
tell
us
that
they
were
the
originals
of
the
brussels
griffons
and
to
the
sporting
propensities
of
the
aforesaid
miners
is
attributed
the
gameness
which
is
such
a
characteristic
of
their
representatives
no
one
who
is
well
acquainted
with
the
brussels
griffon
would
claim
that
the
breed
dates
back
like
the
greyhound
to
hoary
antiquity
or
indeed
that
it
has
any
pretensions
to
have
come
over
with
the
conqueror
the
dog
is
not
less
worthy
of
admiration
on
that
account
it
is
futile
to
inquire
too
closely
into
his
ancestry
like
topsy
he
growed
and
we
must
love
him
for
himself
alone
even
in
the
last
fifteen
years
we
can
trace
a
certain
advance
in
the
evolution
of
the
brussels
griffon
when
the
breed
was
first
introduced
under
this
name
into
this
country
underjaw
was
accounted
of
little
or
no
importance
whereas
now
a
prominent
chin
is
rightly
recognised
as
being
one
of
the
most
important
physical
characteristics
of
the
race
then
again
quite
a
few
years
ago
a
griffon
with
a
red
coat
was
rarely
met
with
but
now
this
point
has
been
generally
rectified
and
every
show
specimen
of
any
account
whatever
possesses
the
covering
the
first
authentic
importations
of
brussels
griffons
into
this
country
were
made
by
kingscote
miss
adela
gordon
frank
pearce
and
fletcher
who
at
that
time
kept
a
in
regent
street
handley
spicer
soon
followed
and
it
was
at
her
house
that
in
the
griffon
bruxellois
club
was
first
suggested
and
then
formed
the
brussels
griffon
club
of
london
was
a
later
offshoot
of
this
club
and
like
many
children
would
appear
to
be
more
vigorous
than
its
parent
griffons
soon
made
their
appearance
at
shows
and
won
many
admirers
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
their
progress
up
the
ladder
of
popularity
was
not
so
rapid
as
might
have
been
expected
the
breed
is
especially
attractive
in
the
following
points
it
is
hardy
compact
portable
very
intelligent
equally
smart
and
alert
in
appearance
affectionate
very
companionable
and
above
all
it
possesses
the
special
characteristic
of
wonderful
eyes
ever
changing
in
expression
and
compared
with
which
the
eyes
of
many
other
toy
breeds
appear
as
a
glass
bead
to
a
fathomless
lake
griffons
are
hardy
little
dogs
though
like
most
others
they
are
more
susceptible
to
damp
than
to
cold
while
not
greedy
like
the
terrier
tribe
they
are
usually
good
feeders
and
good
doers
and
not
tiresomely
dainty
with
regard
to
food
as
is
so
often
the
case
with
toy
spaniels
it
must
be
admitted
that
griffons
are
not
the
easiest
of
dogs
to
rear
particularly
at
weaning
time
from
five
to
eight
weeks
is
always
a
critical
period
in
the
puppyhood
of
a
griffon
and
it
is
necessary
to
supersede
their
maternal
nourishment
with
extreme
caution
farinaceous
foods
do
not
answer
and
usually
cause
trouble
sooner
or
later
a
small
quantity
of
scraped
raw
beef
an
eggspoonful
at
four
weeks
increasing
to
a
teaspoonful
at
six
may
be
given
once
a
day
and
from
four
to
five
weeks
two
additional
meals
of
warm
milk
goat
for
preference
and
not
more
than
a
tablespoonful
at
a
time
should
be
given
from
five
to
six
weeks
the
mother
will
remain
with
the
puppies
at
night
only
and
three
milk
meals
may
be
given
during
the
day
with
one
of
scraped
meat
at
intervals
of
about
four
hours
care
being
taken
to
give
too
little
milk
rather
than
too
much
at
six
weeks
the
puppies
may
usually
be
taken
entirely
from
the
mother
and
at
this
time
it
is
generally
advisable
to
give
a
gentle
vermifuge
such
as
ruby
a
very
little
german
rusk
may
also
be
added
to
the
milk
meals
which
may
be
increased
to
one
and
tablespoonfuls
at
a
time
but
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
trouble
is
caused
by
overfeeding
rather
than
underfeeding
and
until
the
rubicon
of
eight
weeks
has
been
passed
care
and
oversight
should
be
unremitting
at
eight
weeks
old
force
or
brown
breadcrumbs
may
be
added
to
the
morning
milk
chopped
meat
may
be
given
instead
of
scraped
at
midday
the
usual
milk
at
and
a
dry
biscuit
such
as
plasmon
for
supper
at
ten
weeks
old
the
milk
at
may
be
discontinued
and
the
other
meals
increased
accordingly
and
very
little
further
trouble
need
be
feared
for
griffons
very
rarely
suffer
from
teething
troubles
brussels
griffons
are
divided
into
three
groups
according
to
their
appearance
and
representatives
of
each
group
may
be
and
sometimes
are
found
in
one
and
the
same
litter
first
and
foremost
both
in
importance
and
in
beauty
comes
the
griffon
bruxellois
a
cobby
compact
little
dog
with
wiry
red
coat
large
eyes
short
nose
well
turned
up
and
sloping
back
very
prominent
chin
and
small
ears
secondly
come
the
griffons
of
any
other
colour
or
as
they
are
termed
in
brussels
griffons
belges
these
are
very
often
griffons
of
the
usual
colour
with
a
mismark
of
white
or
black
or
occasionally
they
may
be
grey
or
fawn
but
the
most
approved
colour
and
certainly
the
most
attractive
is
black
and
tan
the
third
group
of
brussels
griffons
is
that
termed
smooth
or
in
brussels
griffons
brabancons
the
smooth
griffon
is
identical
with
the
rough
in
all
points
except
for
being
as
is
well
known
smooth
griffons
are
most
useful
for
breeding
rough
ones
with
the
desired
hard
red
coat
and
many
show
dogs
with
rough
coats
have
been
bred
from
smooth
ones
for
example
sparklets

the

except
in
the
matter
of
size
the
general
appearance
and
qualifications
of
the
miniature
black
and
tan
terrier
should
be
as
nearly
like
the
larger
breed
as
possible
for
the
standard

points

to
both
varieties
excepting
that
erect
or
what
are
commonly

are
permissible
in
the

the
officially
recognised
weight
for
the
toy
variety
is
given
as
under
seven
pounds
but
none
of
the
most
prominent
winners
reach
anything
like
that
weight
some
in
fact
are
little
more
than
half
of
it
and
the
great
majority
are

small

and
the
true
type
of

his
markings

his

is
entirely
free
from
the
bare
patches
which
so
often
mar
the
appearance
of
these
toys
giving
the
suggestion
of
delicacy
the
miniature
black
and
tan
is
certainly
not
a
robust
dog
and
he
has
lost
much
of
the
terrier
boisterousness
of
character
by
reason
of
being
pampered
and
coddled
but
it
is
a
fallacy
to
suppose
that
he
is
necessarily
delicate
he
requires
to
be
kept
warm
but
exercise
is
better
for
him
than
eiderdown
quilts
and
silken
cushions
and
judicious
feeding
will
protect
him
from
the
skin
diseases
to
which
he
is
believed
to
be
liable
under
proper
treatment
he
is
no
more
delicate
than
any
other
toy
dog
and
his
engaging
manners
and
cleanliness
of
habit
ought
to
place
him
among
the
most
favoured
of
lady
pets
and
lapdogs
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
efforts
now
being
made
by
the
black
and
tan
terrier
club
will
be
beneficial
to
the
increased
popularity
of
this
diminutive
breed

the
technical

the

this
is
a
pity
as
their

is
most
amusing
as
pets
they
are
most
affectionate
excellent
as
clever
at
acquiring
tricks
and
always
cheerful
and
companionable
they
have
good
noses
and
will
hunt
diligently
but
wet
weather
or
thick
undergrowth
will
deter
them
and
they
are
too
small
to
do
serious
harm
to
the
best

most

the
breed
remains
toy
up
to
lb
when
you
get
a
dog
with
a
long
head
the
latter
in
competition
with
small
dogs
always
takes
the
prize
and
a
slightly
contradictory
state
of
affairs
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
small
dog
with
an
imperfectly
shaped
head
will
sell
for
more
money
than
a
dog
with
a
perfectly
shaped
head
which
is
larger
in
drawing
up
a
show
schedule
of
classes
for
this
breed
it
is
perhaps
better
to
limit
the
weight
of
competitors
to
lb
the
club
put
lb
as
the
lowest
weight
allowed
for
the
large
breed
and
it
seems
a
pity
to
have
an
interregnum
between
the
large
and
miniature
variety
still
in
the
interests
of
the
small
valuable
specimens
this
seems
inevitable
and
opportunist
principles
must
be
applied
to
doggy
matters
as
to
other
business
in
this
world
at
present
there
is
a
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
their
points
but
roughly
they
are
a
long
flat
head
wide
between
the
eyes
and
tapering
to
the
nose
which
should
be
black
ears
erect
and
straight
legs
and
rather
distinctive
feet
some
people
say
these
are

to
have

with
refinement
which

a

and
even
a

black

they
require
warmth
and
plenty
of
exercise
in
all

the
most
elegant
graceful
and
refined
of
all
dogs
are
the
tiny
italian
greyhounds
their
exquisitely
delicate
lines
their
supple
movements
and
beautiful
attitudes
their
soft
large
eyes
their
charming
colouring
their
gentle
and
loving
nature
and
their
scrupulous
cleanliness
of
habit
all
these
qualities
justify
the
admiration
bestowed
upon
them
as
pets
they
are
fragile
it
is
true
fragile
as
eggshell
china
not
to
be
handled
roughly
but
their
constitution
is
not
necessarily
delicate
and
many
have
been
known
to
live
to
extreme
old
age
miss
mackenzie
jack
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
breed
ever
known
lived
to
see
his
seventeenth
birthday
and
even
then
was
strong
and
healthy
their
fragility
is
more
apparent
than
real
and
if
they
are
not
exposed
to
cold
or
damp
they
require
less
pampering
than
they
usually
receive
this
cause
has
been
a
frequent
source
of
constitutional
weakness
and
it
was
deplorably
a
fault
in
the
italian
greyhounds
of
half
a
century
ago
one
can
not
be
quite
certain
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
italian
greyhound
its
physical
appearance
naturally
suggests
a
descent
from
the
gazehound
of
the
ancients
with
the
added
conjecture
that
it
was
purposely
dwarfed
for
the
convenience
of
being
nursed
in
the
lap
greek
art
presents
many
examples
of
a
very
small
dog
of
greyhound
type
and
there
is
a
probability
that
the
diminutive
breed
was
a
familiar
ornament
in
the
atrium
of
most
roman
villas
in
pompeii
a
dwarfed
greyhound
was
certainly
kept
as
a
domestic
pet
and
there
is
therefore
some
justification
for
the
belief
that
the
italian
prefix
is
not
misplaced
in
very
early
times
the
italian
greyhound
was
appreciated
vandyck
kneller
and
watteau
frequently
introduced
the
graceful
figures
of
these
dogs
as
accessories
in
their
portraits
of
the
court
beauties
of
their
times
and
many
such
portraits
may
be
noticed
in
the
galleries
of
windsor
castle
and
hampton
court
mary
queen
of
scots
is
supposed
to
have
been
fond
of
the
breed
as
more
surely
were

of

best
of

at

or

the

is

and
the

as
that

the

of
the

and
have
a
singularly
soft
round
brightness
reminding
one
of
the

practical
management
many
people
are
deterred
from
keeping
dogs
by
the
belief
that
the
hobby
is
expensive
and
that
it
entails
a
profitless
amount
of
trouble
and
anxiety
but
to
the
true
the
anxiety
and
trouble
are
far
outbalanced
by
the
pleasures
of
possession
and
as
to
the
expense
that
is
a
matter
which
can
be
regulated
at

a
luxuriously
appointed
kennel

valuable
dogs
who
are
pampered
into
sickness
may
indeed
become
a
serious
drain
upon
the

if
managed

the
occupation
is
capable
of
yielding
a
very
respectable
income
one
does
not
wish
to
see
turned
into
a
profession
and
there
seems
to
be
something
mean
in
making
money
by
our
pets
but
the
process
of
drafting
is
necessary
when
the
kennel
is
overstocked
and

are
among
the

accessories
of

a

way
still
if

to

direct
to

of

that
they

is
a

arises
only
twice

was
established
upwards
of
dogs
have
passed
through
the
books
a
few
to
be
reclaimed
or
bought
the
great
majority
to
be
put
to
death
a
very
large
proportion
of
these
have
been
veritable
mongrels
not
worth
the
value
of
their
licences
diseased
and
maimed
curs
or
bitches
in
whelp
turned
ruthlessly
adrift
to
be
consigned
to
the
oblivion
of
the
lethal
chamber
where
the
thoroughbred
seldom
finds
its
way
and
if
as
many
as
undesirables
are
destroyed
every
week
at
one
such
institution
is
clear
that
the
mongrel
must
soon
altogether
disappear
but
the
chief
factor
in
the
general
improvement
of
our
canine
population
is
due
to
the
steadily
growing
care
and
pride
which
are
bestowed
upon
the
dog
and
to
the
scientific
skill
with
which
he
is
being
bred
admitting
that
the
dogs
seen
at
our
best
contemporary
shows
are
superlative
examples
of
scientific
selection
one
has
yet
to
acknowledge
that
the
process
of
breeding
for
show
points
has
its
disadvantages
and
that
in
the
sporting
and
pastoral
varieties
more
especially
utility
is
apt
to
be
sacrificed
to
ornament
and
type
and
stamina
to
fancy
qualities
not
always
relative
to
the
capacities
as
a
worker
the
standards
of
perfection
and
scales
of
points
laid
down
by
the
specialist
clubs
are
usually
admirable
guides
to
the
uninitiated
but
they
are
often
unreasonably
arbitrary
in
their
insistence
upon
certain
details
of
form
generally
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
head
while
they
leave
the
qualities
of
type
and
character
to
look
after
themselves
or
to
be
totally
ignored
it
is
necessary
to
assure
the
beginner
in
breeding
that
points
are
essentially
of
far
less
moment
than
type
and
a
good
constitution
the
one
thing
necessary
in
the
cultivation
of
the
dog
is
to
bear
in
mind
the
purpose
for
which
he
is
supposed
to
be
employed
and
to
aim
at
adapting
or
conserving
his
physique
to
the
best
fulfilment
of
that
purpose
remembering
that
the
greyhound
has
loins
to
give
elasticity
and
bend
to
the
body
in
running
that
a
terrier
is
kept
small
to
enable
him
the
better
to
enter
an
earth
that
a
bulldog
is
massive
and
undershot
for
encounters
in
the
bullring
that
the
collie
ears
are
erected
to
assist
him
in
hearing
sounds
from
afar
as
those
of
the
bloodhound
are
pendant
the
more
readily
to
detect
sounds
coming
to
him
along
the
ground
while
his
head
is
bent
to
the
trail
nature
has
been
discriminate
in
her
adaptations
of
animal
forms
and
the
most
perfect
dog
yet
bred
is
the
one
which
approaches
nearest
to
nature
wise
intention
the
foregoing
chapters
have
given
abundant
examples
of
how
the
various
breeds
of
the
dog
have
been
acquired
manufactured
improved
resuscitated
and
retained
broadly
speaking
two
methods
have
been
adopted
the
method
of
introducing
an
outcross
to
impart
new
blood
new
strength
new
character
and
the
method
of
inbreeding
to
retain
an
approved
type
an
outcross
is
introduced
when
the
breed
operated
upon
is
declining
in
stamina
or
is
in
danger
of
extinction
or
when
some
new
physical
or
mental
quality
is
desired
new
types
and
eccentricities
are
hardly
wanted
however
and
the
extreme
requirements
of
an
outcross
may
nowadays
be
achieved
by
the
simple
process
of
selecting
individuals
from
differing
strains
of
the
same
breed
mating
a
bitch
which
lacks
the
required
points
with
a
dog
in
whose
family
they
are
prominently
and
consistently
present
inbreeding
is
the
reverse
of
outcrossing
it
is
the
practice
of
mating
animals
closely
related
to
each
other
and
it
is
within
limits
an
entirely
justifiable
means
of
preserving
and
intensifying
family
characteristics
it
is
a
law
in
zoology
that
an
animal
can
not
transmit
a
quality
which
it
does
not
itself
innately
possess
or
which
none
of
its
progenitors
has
ever
possessed
by
mating
a
dog
and
a
bitch
of
the
same
family
therefore
you
concentrate
and
enhance
the
uniform
inheritable
qualities
into
one
line
instead
of
two
and
you
reduce
the
number
of
possibly
heterogeneous
ancestors
by
exactly
a
half
right
back
to
the
very
beginning
there
is
no
surer
way
of
maintaining
uniformity
of
type
and
an
examination
of
the
extended
pedigree
of
almost
any
famous
dog
will
show
how
commonly
inbreeding
is
practised
inbreeding
is
certainly
advantageous
when
managed
with
judgment
and
discreet
selection
but
it
has
its
disadvantages
also
for
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
faults
and
blemishes
are
inherited
as
well
as
merits
and
that
the
faults
have
a
way
of
asserting
themselves
with
annoying
persistency
furthermore
breeding
between
animals
closely
allied
in
parentage
is
prone
to
lead
to
degeneracy
physical
weakness
and
mental
stupidity
while
impotence
and
sterility
are
frequent
concomitants
and
none
but
experienced
breeders
should
attempt
so
hazardous
an
experiment
observation
has
proved
that
the
union
of
father
with
daughter
and
mother
with
son
is
preferable
to
an
alliance
between
brother
and
sister
perhaps
the
best
union
is
that
between
cousins
for
the
preservation
of
general
type
however
it
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
keep
to
one
strain
and
to
select
from
that
strain
members
who
while
exhibiting
similar
characteristics
are
not
actually
too
closely
allied
in
consanguinity
to
move
perpetually
from
one
strain
to
another
is
only
to
court
an
undesirable
confusion
of
type
in
founding
a
kennel
it
is
advisable
to
begin
with
the
possession
of
a
bitch
as
a
companion
the
female
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
male
she
is
not
less
affectionate
and
faithful
and
she
is
usually
much
cleaner
in
her
habits
in
the
house
if
it
is
intended
to
breed
by
her
she
should
be
very
carefully
chosen
and
proved
to
be
free
from
any
serious
fault
or
predisposition
to
disease
not
only
should
her
written
pedigree
be
scrupulously
scrutinised
but
her
own
constitution
and
that
of
her
parents
on
both
sides
should
be
minutely
inquired
into
a
bitch
comes
into
season
for
breeding
twice
in
a
year
the
first
time
when
she
is
reaching
maturity
usually
at
the
age
of
from
seven
to
ten
months
her
condition
will
readily
be
discerned
by
the
fact
of
an
increased
attentiveness
of
the
opposite
sex
and
the
appearance
of
a
mucous
discharge
from
the
vagina
she
should
then
be
carefully
protected
from
the
gallantry
of
suitors
dogs
kept
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
a
bitch
on
heat
who
is
not
accessible
to
them
go
off
their
feed
and
suffer
in
condition
with
most
breeds
it
is
unwise
to
put
a
bitch
to
stud
before
she
is
eighteen
months
old
but
stubbs
recommends
that
a
bull
bitch
should
be
allowed
to
breed
at
her
first
heat
while
her
body
retains
the
flexibility
of
youth
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
with
regard
to
the
bulldog
great
mortality
occurs
in
attempting
to
breed
from
maiden
bitches
exceeding
three
years
old
in
almost
all
breeds
it
is
the
case
that
the
first
three
litters
are
the
best
it
is
accordingly
important
that
a
proper
mating
should
be
considered
at
the
outset
and
a
prospective
sire
selected
either
through
the
medium
of
stud
advertisements
or
by
private
arrangement
with
the
owner
of
the
desired
dog
for
the
payment
of
the
requisite
stud
fee
varying
from
a
guinea
to
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
the
services
of
the
best
dogs
of
the
particular
breed
can
usually
be
secured
it
is
customary
for
the
bitch
to
be
the
visitor
and
it
is
well
that
her
visit
should
extend
to
two
or
three
days
at
the
least
when
possible
a
responsible
person
should
accompany
her
if
the
stud
dog
is
a
frequenter
of
shows
he
can
usually
be
depended
upon
to
be
in
sound
physical
condition
no
dog
who
is
not
so
can
be
expected
to
win
prizes
but
it
ought
to
be
ascertained
before
hand
that
he
is
what
is
known
as
a
good
the
fee
is
for
his
services
not
for
the
result
of
them
some
owners
of
stud
dogs
will
grant
two
services
and
this
is
often
desirable
especially
in
the
case
of
a
maiden
bitch
or
of
a
stud
dog
that
is
as
so
many
are
it
is
most
important
that
both
the
mated
animals
should
be
free
from
worms
and
skin
disorders
fifty
per
cent
of
the
casualties
among
young
puppies
are
due
to
one
or
other
of
the
parents
having
been
in
an
unhealthy
condition
when
mated
a
winter
whelping
is
not
advisable
it
is
best
for
puppies
to
be
born
in
the
spring
or
early
summer
thus
escaping
the
rigours
of
inclement
weather
during
the
period
of
gestation
the
breeding
bitch
should
have
ample
but
not
violent
exercise
with
varied
and
wholesome
food
including
some
preparation
of
bone
meal
and
at
about
the
third
week
whether
she
seems
to
require
it
or
not
she
should
be
treated
for
worms
at
about
the
sixtieth
day
she
will
begin
to
be
uneasy
and
restless
a
mild
purgative
should
be
given
usually
salad
oil
is
enough
but
if
constipation
is
apparent
castor
oil
may
be
necessary
on
the
day
the
whelps
may
be
expected
and
everything
ought
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
event
a
coarsely
constituted
bitch
may
be
trusted
to
look
after
herself
on
these
occasions
no
help
is
necessary
and
one
may
come
down
in
the
morning
to
find
her
with
her
litter
comfortably
nestling
at
her
side
but
with
the
toy
breeds
and
the
breeds
that
have
been
reared
in
artificial
conditions
difficult
or
protracted
parturition
is
frequent
and
human
assistance
ought
to
be
at
hand
in
case
of
need
the
owner
of
a
valuable
bull
bitch
for
example
would
never
think
of
leaving
her
to
her
own
unaided
devices
all
undue
interference
however
should
be
avoided
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
person
attending
her
should
be
one
with
whom
she
is
fondly
familiar
in
anticipation
of
a
possibly
numerous
litter
a
should
be
arranged
for
beforehand
comfortable
quarters
should
be
prepared
in
a
quiet
part
of
the
house
or
kennels
warm
and
free
from
draughts
clean
bedding
of
wheaten
straw
should
be
provided
but
the
bitch
should
be
allowed
to
make
her
nest
in
her
own
instinctive
fashion
let
her
have
easy
access
to
drinking
water
she
will
probable
refuse
food
for
a
few
hours
before
her
time
but
a
little
concentrated
nourishment
such
as
brand
essence
or
a
drink
of
warm
milk
should
be
offered
to
her
in
further
preparation
for
the
confinement
a
basin
of
water
containing
antiseptic
for
washing
in
towels
warm
milk
a
flask
of
brandy
a
bottle
of
ergotine
and
a
pair
of
scissors
are
commodities
which
may
all
be
required
in
emergency
the
ergot
which
must
be
used
with
extreme
caution
and
only
when
the
labour
pains
have
commenced
is
invaluable
when
parturition
is
protracted
and
there
is
difficult
straining
without
result
its
effect
is
to
contract
the
womb
and
expel
the
contents
but
when
the
puppies
are
expelled
with
ease
it
is
superfluous
for
a
bitch
of
lb
in
weight
ten
drops
of
the
extract
of
ergot
in
a
teaspoonful
of
water
should
be
ample
given
by
the
mouth
the
scissors
are
for
severing
the
umbilical
cord
if
the
mother
should
fail
to
do
it
in
her
own
natural
way
sometimes
a
puppy
may
be
enclosed
within
a
membrane
which
the
dam
can
not
readily
open
with
tongue
and
teeth
if
help
is
necessary
it
should
be
given
tenderly
and
with
clean
fingers
occasionally
a
puppy
may
seem
to
be
inert
and
lifeless
and
after
repeatedly
licking
it
the
bitch
may
relinquish
all
effort
at
restoration
and
turn
her
attention
to
another
that
is
being
born
in
such
a
circumstance
the
rejected
little
one
may
be
discreetly
removed
and
a
drop
of
brandy
on
the
point
of
the
finger
smeared
upon
its
tongue
may
revive
animation
or
it
may
be
plunged
up
to
the
neck
in
warm
water
the
object
should
be
to
keep
it
warm
and
to
make
it
breathe
when
the
puppies
are
all
born
their
dam
may
be
given
a
drink
of
warm
milk
and
then
left
alone
to
their
toilet
and
to
suckle
them
if
any
should
be
dead
these
ought
to
be
disposed
of
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
others
should
be
temporarily
repressed
and
inspection
of
them
delayed
until
a
more
fitting
opportunity
if
any
are
then
seen
to
be
malformed
or
to
have
cleft
palates
these
had
better
be
removed
and
mercifully
destroyed
it
is
the
experience
of
many
observers
that
the
first
whelps
born
in
a
litter
are
the
strongest
largest
and
healthiest
if
the
litter
is
a
large
one
the
last
born
may
be
noticeably
puny
and
this
disparity
in
size
may
continue
to
maturity
the
wise
breeder
will
decide
for
himself
how
many
whelps
should
be
left
to
the
care
of
their
dam
the
number
should
be
relative
to
her
health
and
constitution
and
in
any
case
it
is
well
not
to
give
her
so
many
that
they
will
be
a
drain
upon
her
those
breeds
of
dogs
that
have
been
most
highly
developed
by
man
and
that
appear
to
have
the
greatest
amount
of
brain
and
intelligence
are
generally
the
most
prolific
as
to
the
number
of
puppies
they
produce
bernards
pointers
setters
are
notable
for
the
usual
strength
of
their
families
bernards
have
been
known
to
produce
as
many
as
eighteen
whelps
at
a
birth
and
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
them
to
produce
from
nine
to
twelve
a
pointer
of
barclay
produced
fifteen
and
it
is
well
known
that
statter
setter
phoebe
produced
at
a
birth
phoebe
reared
ten
of
these
herself
and
almost
every
one
of
the
family
became
celebrated
it
would
be
straining
the
natural
possibilities
of
any
bitch
to
expect
her
to
bring
up
eighteen
puppies
healthily
half
that
number
would
tax
her
natural
resources
to
the
extreme
but
nature
is
extraordinarily
adaptive
in
tempering
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
and
a
dam
who
gives
birth
to
a
numerous
litter
ought
not
to
have
her
family
unduly
reduced
it
was
good
policy
to
allow
phoebe
to
have
the
rearing
of
as
many
as
ten
out
of
her
a
bitch
having
twelve
will
bring
up
nine
very
well
one
having
nine
will
rear
seven
without
help
and
a
bitch
having
seven
will
bring
up
five
better
than
four
breeders
of
often
rear
the
overplus
offspring
by
hand
with
the
help
of
a
maw
and
thompson
peptonised
milk
and
one
or
more
of
the
various
advertised
infants

or
orphan

foods

engage
or
prepare

advance

the
need
not
be
of
the
same
breed
but
she
should
be
approximately
of
similar
size
and
her
own
family
ought
to
be
of
the
same
age
as
the
one
of
which
she
is
to
take
additional
charge
one
can
usually
be
secured
through
advertisement
in
the
canine
press
some
owners
do
not
object
to
taking
one
from
a
dogs
home
which
is
an
easy
method
in
consideration
of
the
circumstance
that
by
far
the
larger
number
of
lost
dogs
are
bitches
sent
adrift
because
they
are
in
whelp
the
chief
risk
in
this
course
is
that
the
unknown
may
be
diseased
or
verminous
or
have
contracted
the
seeds
of
distemper
or
her
milk
may
be
populated
with
embryo
worms
these
are

not
to
be
a
necessary
accompaniment
of

they

li
some
common
ailments
of
the
dog
and
their
treatment
the
experienced
has
long
ago
realised
that
cleanliness
wholesome
food
judicious
exercise
and
a
dry
comfortable
and
kennel
are
the
surest
safeguards
of
health
and
that
attention
to
these
necessaries
saves
him
an
infinitude
of
trouble
and
anxiety
by
protecting
his
dogs
from
disease
on
the
first
appearance
of
illness
in
his
kennels
the
wise
at
once
calls
in
the
skill
of
a
good
veterinary
surgeon
but
there
are
some
of
the
minor
ailments
which
he
can
deal
with
himself
whilst
he
ought
at
least
to
be
able
to
recognise
the
first
symptoms
of
the
dreaded
distemper
and
give
first
aid
until
the
vet
arrives
to
apply
his
remedies
and
give
professional
advice
distemper
although
more
than
one
hundred
years
have
elapsed
since
this
was
first
imported
to
this
country
from
france
a
great
amount
of
misunderstanding
still
prevails
among
a
large
section
of
regarding
its
true
nature
and
origin
the
fact
is
the
disease
came
to
us
with
a
bad
name
for
the
french
themselves
deemed
it
incurable
in
this
country
the
plan
of
treatment
was
wont
to
be
the
usual
rough
remedies
emetics
purgatives
the
seton
and
the
lancet
failing
in
this
specifics
of
all
sorts
were
eagerly
sought
for
and
tried
and
are
unfortunately
still
believed
in
to
a
very
great
extent
distemper
has
a
certain
course
to
run
and
in
this
disease
nature
seems
to
attempt
the
elimination
of
the
poison
through
the
secretions
thrown
out
by
the
mucous
membrane
our
chief
difficulty
in
the
treatment
of
distemper
lies
in
the
complications
thereof
we
may
and
often
do
have
the
organs
of
respiration
attacked
we
have
sometimes
congestion
of
the
liver
or
mucous
inflammation
of
the
bile
ducts
or
some
lesion
of
the
brain
or
nervous
structures
combined
with
epilepsy
convulsions
or
chorea
distemper
is
also
often
complicated
with
severe
disease
of
the
bowels
and
at
times
with
an
affection
of
the
eyes
whether
it
be
that
the
distemper
virus
the
poison
seedling
of
the
disease
really
originates
in
the
kennel
or
is
the
result
of
contact
of
one
dog
with
another
or
whether
the
poison
floats
to
the
kennel
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
or
is
carried
there
on
a
shoe
or
the
point
of
a
the
following
facts
ought
to
be
borne
in
mind
anything
that
debilitates
the
body
or
weakens
the
nervous
system
paves
the
way
for
the
distemper
poison
the
healthier
the
dog
the
more
power
does
he
possess
to
resist
contagion
when
the
disease
is
epizootic
it
can
often
be
kept
at
bay
by
proper
attention
to
diet
and
exercise
frequent
change
of
kennel
straw
and
perfect
cleanliness
the
predisposing
causes
which
have
come
more
immediately
under
my
notice
are
debility
cold
damp
starvation
filthy
kennels
unwholesome
food
impure
air
and
grief
age
at
which
dogs
take
they
may
take
distemper
at
any
age
the
most
common
time
of
life
is
from
the
fifth
till
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
month
there
is
first
and
foremost
a
period
of
latency
or
of
incubation
in
which
there
is
more
or
less
of
dullness
and
loss
of
appetite
and
this
glides
gradually
into
a
state
of
feverishness
the
fever
may
be
ushered
in
with
chills
and
shivering
the
nose
now
becomes
hot
and
dry
the
dog
is
restless
and
thirsty
and
the
conjunctivae
of
the
eyes
will
be
found
to
be
considerably
injected
sometimes
the
bowels
are
at
first
constipated
but
they
are
more
usually
irregular
sneezing
will
also
be
frequent
and
in
some
cases
cough
dry
and
husky
at
first
the
temperature
should
be
taken
and
if
there
is
a
rise
of
two
or
three
degrees
the
case
should
be
treated
as
distemper
and
not
as
a
common
cold
at
the
commencement
there
is
but
little
exudation
from
the
eyes
and
nose
but
as
the
disease
advances
this
symptom
will
become
more
marked
being
clear
at
first
so
too
will
another
symptom
which
is
partially
diagnostic
of
the
malady
namely
increased
heat
of
body
combined
with
a
rapid
falling
off
in
flesh
sometimes
indeed
proceeding
quickly
on
to
positive
emaciation
as
the
disease
creeps
downwards
and
inwards
along
the
the
chest
gets
more
and
more
affected
the
discharge
of
mucus
and
pus
from
the
nostrils
more
abundant
and
the
cough
loses
its
dry
character
becoming
moist
the
discharge
from
the
eyes
is
simply
mucus
and
pus
but
if
not
constantly
dried
away
will
gum
the
inflamed
lids
together
that
from
the
nostrils
is
not
only
purulent
but
often
mixed
with
dark
blood
the
appetite
is
now
clean
gone
and
there
is
often
vomiting
and
occasional
attacks
of
diarrhoea
now
in
mild
cases
we
may
look
for
some
abatement
of
the
symptoms
about
the
fourteenth
day
the
fever
gets
less
inflammation
decreases
in
the
mucous
passages
and
appetite
is
restored
as
one
of
the
first
signs
of
returning
health
more
often
however
the
disease
becomes
complicated
the
diagnostic
symptoms
are
the
severe
catarrh
combined
not
only
with
fever
but
speedy
emaciation
as
we
might
easily
imagine
is
a
very
likely
complication
and
a
very
dangerous
one
there
is
great
distress
in
breathing
the
animal
panting
rapidly
the
countenance
is
anxious
the
pulse
small
and
frequent
and
the
extremities
cold
the
animal
would
fain
sit
up
on
his
haunches
or
even
seek
to
get
out
into
the
fresh
air
but
sickness
weakness
and
prostration
often
forbid
his
movements
if
the
ear
or
stethoscope
be
applied
to
the
chest
the
characteristic
signs
of
pneumonia
will
be
heard
these
are
sounds
of
moist
crepitations
etc
is
probably
the
most
common
complication
in
fact
it
is
always
present
except
in
very
mild
cases
the
cough
becomes
more
severe
and
often
comes
on
in
tearing
paroxysms
causing
sickness
and
vomiting
the
breathing
is
short
and
frequent
the
mouth
hot
and
filled
with
viscid
saliva
while
very
often
the
bowels
are
constipated
if
the
liver
becomes
involved
we
shall
very
soon
have
the
jaundiced
eye
and
the
yellow
skin
is
another
very
common
complication
we
have
frequent
purging
and
maybe
sickness
and
vomiting
of
a
convulsive
character
are
frequent
concomitants
of
distemper
is
sometimes
seen
owing
no
doubt
to
degeneration
of
the
nerve
centres
caused
by
there
are
many
other
complications
and
skin
complaints
are
common
after
it
this
consists
firstly
in
doing
all
in
our
power
to
guide
the
specific
catarrhal
fever
to
a
safe
termination
and
secondly
in
watching
for
and
combating
complications
whenever
we
see
a
young
dog
ailing
losing
appetite
exhibiting
catarrhal
symptoms
and
getting
thin
with
a
rise
in
temperature
we
should
not
lose
an
hour
if
he
be
an
indoor
dog
find
him
a
good
bed
in
a
clean
apartment
free
from
lumber
and
free
from
dirt
if
it
be
summer
have
all
the
windows
out
or
opened
if
winter
a
little
fire
will
be
necessary
but
have
half
the
window
opened
at
the
same
time
only
take
precautions
against
his
lying
in
a
draught
fresh
air
in
cases
of
distemper
and
indeed
in
fevers
of
all
kinds
can
not
be
too
highly
extolled
the
more
rest
the
dog
has
the
better
he
must
be
kept
free
from
excitement
and
care
must
be
taken
to
guard
him
against
cold
and
wet
when
he
goes
out
of
doors
to
obey
the
calls
of
nature
the
most
perfect
cleanliness
must
be
enjoined
and
disinfectants
used
such
as
permanganate
of
potash
carbolic
acid
pearson
or
izal
if
the
sick
dog
on
the
other
hand
be
one
of
a
kennel
of
dogs
then
quarantine
must
be
adopted
the
hospital
should
be
quite
removed
from
the
vicinity
of
all
other
dogs
and
as
soon
as
the
animal
is
taken
from
the
kennel
the
latter
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
and
disinfected
and
the
other
dogs
kept
warm
and
dry
well
fed
and
moderately
exercised
and
for
the
first
three
or
four
days
let
the
food
be
light
and
easily
digested
in
order
to
induce
the
animal
to
take
it
it
should
be
as
palatable
as
possible
for
small
dogs
you
can
not
have
anything
better
than
milk
porridge
at
all
events
the
dog
must
if
possible
be
induced
to
eat
he
must
not
be
horned
unless
there
be
great
emaciation
he
must
not
but
what
he
gets
must
be
good
as
to
drink
dogs
usually
prefer
clean
cold
water
and
we
can
not
do
harm
by
mixing
therewith
a
little
plain
nitre
oatmeal
porridge
made
with
milk
instead
of
water
begin
by
giving
a
simple
dose
of
castor
oil
just
enough
and
no
more
than
will
clear
out
the
bowels
by
one
or
two
motions
drastic
purgatives
and
medicines
such
as
mercury
jalap
aloes
and
podophyllyn
can
not
be
too
highly
condemned
for
very
small
toy
dogs
such
as
italian
greyhounds
yorkshire
terriers
i
should
not
recommend
even
oil
itself
but
one
drachm
to
two
drachms
dissolved
in
milk
by
simply
getting
the
bowels
to
act
once
or
twice
we
shall
have
done
enough
for
the
first
day
and
have
only
to
make
the
dog
comfortable
for
the
night
on
the
next
day
begin
with
a
mixture
such
as
the
following
solution
of
acetate
of
ammonia
drops
to
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
drops
to
salicylate
of
soda
grains
to
thrice
daily
in
a
little
camphor
water
if
the
cough
be
very
troublesome
and
the
fever
does
not
run
very
high
the
following
may
be
substituted
for
this
on
the
second
or
third
day
syrup
of
squills
drops
to
tincture
of
henbane
drops
to
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
drops
to
in
camphor
water
a
few
drops
of
dilute
hydrochloric
acid
should
be
added
to
the
drink
and
two
teaspoonfuls
to
a
quart
of
water
of
the
chlorate
of
potash
this
makes
an
excellent
fever
drink
especially
if
the
dog
can
be
got
to
take
decoction
of
barley
instead
of
plain
cold
water
best
made
of
keen
and
robinson
patent
barley
if
there
be
persistent
sickness
and
vomiting
the
medicine
must
be
stopped
for
a
time
small
boluses
of
ice
frequently
administered
will
do
much
good
and
doses
of
dilute
prussic
acid
from
one
to
four
drops
in
a
little
water
will
generally
arrest
the
vomiting
if
constipation
be
present
we
must
use
no
rough
remedies
to
get
rid
of
it
a
little
raw
meat
cut
into
small
pieces
minced
in
fact
or
a
small
portion
of
raw
liver
may
be
given
if
there
be
little
fever
if
there
be
fever
we
are
to
trust
for
a
time
to
injections
of
plain
diarrhoea
although
often
a
troublesome
symptom
is
it
must
be
remembered
a
salutary
one
unless
therefore
it
becomes
excessive
do
not
interfere
if
it
does
give
the
simple
chalk
mixture
three
times
a
day
but
no
longer
than
is
needful
the
discharge
from
the
mouth
and
nose
is
to
be
wiped
away
with
a
soft
rag
or
better
still
some
tow
which
is
afterwards
to
be
burned
wetted
with
a
weak
solution
of
carbolic
the
forehead
eyes
and
nose
may
be
fomented
two
or
three
times
a
day
with
moderately
hot
water
with
great
advantage
it
is
not
judicious
to
wet
a
dog
much
but
a
one
may
have
the
chest
and
throat
well
fomented
several
times
a
day
and
well
rubbed
dry
afterwards
heat
applied
to
the
chests
of
dogs
by
means
of
a
flat
iron
will
also
effect
good
the
following
is
an
excellent
tonic
sulphate
of
quinine
to
grains
powdered
rhubarb
to
grains
extract
of
taraxacum
to
grains
make
a
bolus
thrice
daily
during
convalescence
good
food
virol
spratts
invalid
food
and
invalid
biscuit
moderate
exercise
fresh
air
and
protection
from
cold
these
with
an
occasional
mild
dose
of
castor
oil
or
rhubarb
are
to
be
our
i
find
no
better
tonic
than
the
tablets
of
phosferine
one
quarter
of
a
tablet
thrice
daily
rolled
in
tissue
paper
for
a
toy
dog
up
to
two
tablets
for
a
dog
of
mastiff
size
bronchitis
dogs
that
have
been
exposed
to
wet
or
that
have
been
put
to
lie
in
a
damp
or
draughty
kennel
with
insufficient
food
are
not
less
liable
than
their
masters
to
catch
a
severe
cold
which
if
not
promptly
attended
to
may
extend
downward
to
the
lining
membranes
of
bronchi
or
lungs
in
such
cases
there
is
always
symptoms
more
or
less
of
fever
with
fits
of
shivering
and
thirst
accompanied
with
dullness
a
tired
appearance
and
loss
of
appetite
the
breath
is
short
inspirations
painful
and
there
is
a
rattling
of
mucus
in
chest
or
throat
the
most
prominent
symptom
perhaps
is
the
frequent
cough
it
is
at
first
dry
ringing
and
evidently
painful
in
a
few
days
however
or
sooner
it
softens
and
there
is
a
discharge
of
frothy
mucus
with
it
and
in
the
latter
stages
of
pus
and
ropy
mucus
keep
the
patient
in
a
comfortable
apartment
with
free
access
in
and
out
if
the
weather
be
dry
let
the
bowels
be
freely
acted
upon
to
begin
with
but
no
weakening
discharge
from
the
bowels
must
be
kept
up
after
the
bowels
have
been
moved
we
should
commence
the
exhibition
of
small
doses
of
tartar
emetic
with
squills
and
opium
thrice
a
day
if
the
cough
is
very
troublesome
give
this
mixture
tincture
of
squills
drops
to
paregoric
drops
to
tartar
emetic
of
a
grain
to
grain
syrup
and
water
a
sufficiency
thrice
daily
we
may
give
a
full
dose
of
opium
every
night
in
mild
cases
carbonate
of
ammonia
may
be
tried
it
often
does
good
the
dose
being
from
two
grains
to
ten
in
camphor
water
or
even
plain
water
the
chronic
form
of
bronchitis
will
always
yield
if
the
dog
is
young
to
careful
feeding
moderate
exercise
and
the
exhibition
of
oil
with
a
mild
iron
tonic
the
exercise
however
must
be
moderate
and
the
dog
kept
from
the
water
a
few
drops
to
a
teaspoonful
of
paregoric
given
at
night
will
do
good
and
the
bowels
should
be
kept
regular
and
a
simple
laxative
pill
given
now
and
then
diarrhoea
or
looseness
of
the
bowels
or
purging
is
a
very
common
disease
among
dogs
of
all
ages
and
breeds
it
is
nevertheless
more
common
among
puppies
about
three
or
four
months
old
and
among
dogs
who
have
reached
the
age
of
from
seven
to
ten
years
it
is
often
symptomatic
of
other
ailments
very
numerous
in
weakly
dogs
exposure
alone
will
produce
it
the
weather
too
has
no
doubt
much
to
do
with
the
production
of
diarrhoea
in
most
kennels
it
is
more
common
in
the
months
of
july
and
august
although
it
often
comes
on
in
the
very
dead
of
winter
puppies
if
overfed
will
often
be
seized
with
this
troublesome
complaint
a
healthy
puppy
hardly
ever
knows
when
it
has
had
enough
and
it
will
moreover
stuff
itself
with
all
sorts
of
garbage
acidity
of
the
stomach
follows
with
vomiting
of
the
ingesta
and
diarrhoea
succeeds
brought
on
by
the
acrid
condition
of
the
chyme
which
finds
its
way
into
the
duodenum
this
stuff
would
in
itself
act
as
a
purgative
but
it
does
more
it
abnormally
excites
the
secretions
of
the
whole
alimentary
canal
and
a
sort
of
mucous
inflammation
is
set
up
the
liver
too
becomes
mixed
up
with
the
mischief
throws
out
a
superabundance
of
bile
and
thus
aids
in
keeping
up
the
diarrhoea
among
other
causes
we
find
the
eating
of
indigestible
food
drinking
foul
or
tainted
water
too
much
green
food
raw
paunches
foul
kennels
and
damp
draughty
kennels
the
purging
is
of
course
the
principal
symptom
and
the
stools
are
either
quite
liquid
or
or
or
mixed
with
slimy
mucus
in
some
cases
they
resemble
dirty
water
sometimes
as
already
said
a
little
blood
will
be
found
in
the
dejection
owing
to
congestion
of
the
mucous
membrane
from
liver
obstruction
in
case
there
be
blood
in
the
stools
a
careful
examination
is
always
necessary
in
order
to
ascertain
the
real
state
of
the
patient
blood
it
must
be
remembered
might
come
from
piles
or
polypi
or
it
might
be
dysenteric
and
proceed
from
ulceration
of
the
rectum
and
colon
in
the
simplest
form
of
diarrhoea
unless
the
disease
continues
for
a
long
time
there
will
not
be
much
wasting
and
the
appetite
will
generally
remain
good
but
capricious
in
bilious
diarrhoea
with
large
brown
fluid
stools
and
complete
loss
of
appetite
there
is
much
thirst
and
in
a
few
days
the
dog
gets
rather
thin
although
nothing
like
so
rapidly
as
in
the
emaciation
of
distemper
will
it
need
hardly
be
said
depend
upon
the
cause
but
as
it
is
generally
caused
by
the
presence
in
the
intestine
of
some
irritating
matter
we
can
hardly
err
by
administering
a
small
dose
of
castor
oil
combining
with
it
if
there
be
much
pain
which
you
can
tell
by
the
animal
countenance
from
to
or
drops
of
laudanum
or
of
the
solution
of
the
muriate
of
morphia
this
in
itself
will
often
suffice
to
cut
short
an
attack
the
oil
is
preferable
to
rhubarb
but
the
latter
may
be
tried
the
simple
not
the
compound

it
the

should
continue
next
day
proceed
cautiously
remember
there
is
no
great
hurry
and
a
sudden
check
to
diarrhoea
is
at
times
dangerous
to
administer
dog
doses
of
the
aromatic
chalk
and
opium
powder
or
give
the
following
medicine
three
times

if

still
continues

of
the

this
after

times
a

the
food
is
of
importance
the
diet
should
be
changed
the

requires
to
be
of
a
kind
no
meat
being
allowed
but
milk
and
bread
sago
or
arrowroot
or
rice
etc
the

of

in

or
patent
if
the
dog
will
take
it
the
bed
must
be
warm
and
clean
and
free
from
draughts
and
in
all
cases
of
diarrhoea
one
can
not
be
too
particular
with
the
cleanliness
and
disinfection
of
the
kennels
constipation
more
commonly
called
costiveness
is
also
a
very
common
complaint
it
often
occurs
in
the
progress
of
other
diseases
but
is
just
as
often
a
separate
ailment
perhaps
no
complaint
to
which
our
canine
friends
are
liable
is
less
understood
by
the
dog
doctor
and
by
dog
owners
themselves
often
caused
by
weakness
in
the
coats
of
the
intestine
exhibition
of
purgatives
can
only
have
a
temporary
effect
in

consequently
by

never
more
correct
in
his

than
when
he
said
many
dogs
have
a
dry
constipated
habit
often
greatly
increased
by
the
bones
on
which
they
are
fed
this
favours
the
disposition
to
mange
etc
it
produces
indigestion
encourages
worms
blackens
the
teeth
and
causes
fetid
breath
the
stools
are
hard
usually
in
large
round
balls
and
defecation
is
accomplished
with
great
difficulty
the
animal
often
having
to
try
several
times
before
he
succeeds
in
effecting
the
act
and
this
only
after
the
most
acute
suffering
the
faeces
are
generally
covered
with
white
mucus
showing
the
heat
and
condition
of
the
gut
the
stool
is
sometimes
so
dry
as
to
fall
to
pieces
like
so
much
oatmeal
there
is
generally
also
a
deficiency
of
bile
in
the
motions
and
in
addition
to
simple
costiveness
we
have
more
or
less
loss
of
appetite
with
a
too
pale
tongue
dullness
and
sleepiness
with
slight
redness
of
the
conjunctiva
sometimes
constipation
alternates
with
diarrhoea

skin
diseases
in

whole
range
of
dog
ailments
included
in
the
term
canine
pathology
there
are
none
more
bothersome
to
treat
successfully
nor
more
difficult
to
diagnose
than
those
of
the
skin
there
are
none
either
that
afford
the
quack
or
monger
a
larger
field
for
the
practice
of
his
fiendish
gifts
if
i
were
to
be
asked
the
questions
why
do
dogs
suffer
so
much
from
skin
complaints
and
why
does
it
appear
to
be
so
difficult
to
treat
them
i
should
answer
the
first
thus
through
the
neglect
of
their
owners
from
want
of
cleanliness
from
injudicious
feeding
from
bad
kennelling
and
from
permitting
their
favourites
such
free
intercourse
with
other
members
of
the
canine
fraternity
overcrowding
is
another
and
distinct
source
of
skin
troubles
my
answer
to
the
second
question
is
that
the
layman
too
often
treats
the
trouble
in
the
skin
as
if
it
were
the
disease
itself
whereas
it
is
generally
merely
a
symptom
thereof
examples
to
plaster
medicated
oils
or
ointments
all
over
the
skin
of
a
dog
suffering
from
constitutional
eczema
is
about
as
sensible
as
would
be
the
painting
white
of
the
yellow
skin
in
jaundice
in
order
to
cure
the
disordered
liver
but
even
those
contagious
diseases
that
are
caused
by
skin
germs
or
animalcules
will
not
be
wholly
cured
by
any
applications
whatever
constitutional
remedies
should
go
hand
in
hand
with
these
and
indeed
so
great
is
the
defensive
power
of
strong
pure
blood
rich
in
its
white
corpuscles
or
leucocytes
that
i
believe
i
could
cure
even
the
worst
forms
of
mange
by
internal
remedies
good
food
and
tonics
without
the
aid
of
any
dressing
whatever
except
pure
cold
water
in
treating
of
skin
diseases
it
is
usual
to
divide
them
into
three
sections
the
the
contagious
and
ailments
caused
by
external
parasites
the
a
this
is
a
redness
with
slight
inflammation
of
the
skin
the
deeper
tissues
underneath
not
being
involved
that
seen
between
the
wrinkles
of
pugs
mastiffs
or
bulldogs
or
inside
the
thighs
of
greyhounds
etc
if
the
skin
breaks
there
may
be
discharges
of
pus
and
if
the
case
is
not
cured
the
skin
may
thicken
and
crack
and
the
dog
make
matters
worse
with
his
tongue
review
and
correct
the
methods
of
feeding
a
dog
should
be
neither
too
gross
nor
too
lean
exercise
perfect
cleanliness
the
early
morning
with
cold
water
and
a
quassia
tonic
he
may
need
a
laxative
as
well
dusting
with
oxide
of
zinc
or
the
violet
powder
of
the
nurseries
a
lotion
of
lead
or
arnica
fomentation
followed
by
cold
water
and
when
dry
dusting
as
above
a
weak
solution
of
boracic
acid
any
chemist
will
sometimes
do
good
b
itching
all
over
with
or
without
scurf
sometimes
thickening
regulation
of
diet
green
vegetables
fruit
if
he
will
take
it
brushing
and
grooming
but
never
roughly
try
for
worms
and
for
fleas
c
the
name
is
not
a
happy
one
as
applied
to
the
usual
itching
skin
disease
of
dogs
eczema
proper
is
an
eruption
in
which
the
formed
matter
dries
off
into
scales
or
scabs
and
dog
eczema
is
as
often
as
not
a
species
of
lichen
then
of
course
it
is
often
accompanied
with
vermin
nearly
always
with
dirt
and
it
is
irritated
out
of
all
character
by
the
biting
and
scratching
of
the
dog
himself
must
be
both
constitutional
and
local
attend
to
the
organs
of
digestion
give
a
moderate
dose
of
opening
medicine
to
clear
away
offending
matter
this
simple
aperient
may
be
repeated
occasionally
say
once
a
week
and
if
diarrhoea
be
present
it
may
be
checked
by
the
addition
of
a
little
morphia
or
dilute
sulphuric
acid
cream
of
tartar
with
sulphur
is
an
excellent
derivative
being
both
diuretic
and
diaphoretic
but
it
must
not
be
given
in
doses
large
enough
to
purge
at
the
same
time
we
may
give
thrice
daily
a
tonic

like
the
following
sulphate
of

sulphate
of

i
know
what
every
remedy
contains
or
i
should
not
recommend
it
benzoated
zinc
ointment
after
the
lotion
has
dried
in

carefully
once
a
week
using
the
ointment
when
skin
is
dry
or
the
lotion
to
allay
irritation
contagious
skin
these
are
usually
called
mange
proper
and
follicular
mange
or
scabies
i
want
to
say
a
word
on
the
latter
first
it
depends
upon
a
microscopic
animalcule
called
the
the
trouble
begins
by
the
formation
of
patches
from
which
the
hair
falls
off
and
on
which
may
be
noticed
a
few
pimples
scabs
form
the
patches
extend
or
come
out
on
other
parts
of
the
body
head
legs
belly
or
sides
skin
becomes
red
in
dogs
odour
of
this
trouble
very
offensive
more
than
itching
seems
to
be
the
symptomatic
rule
whole
body
may
become
affected
dress
the
affected
parts
twice
a
week
with
the
following
creosote
drachms
linseed
oil
ounces
solution
of
potash
ounce
first
mix
the
creosote
and
oil
then
add
the
solution
and
shake
better
to
shave
the
hair
off
around
the
patches
kennels
must
be
kept
clean
with
garden
soap
and
hot
water
and
all
bedding
burned
after
use
from
three
months
to
six
will
be
needed
to
cure
bad
cases
mange
proper
is
also
caused
by
a
parasite
or
acarus
called
the
unlike
eczema
this
mange
is
spread
from
dog
to
dog
by
touch
or
intercommunication
just
as
one
person
catches
the
itch
from
another
at
first
these
may
escape
attention
but
there
are
vesicles
which
the
dog
scratches
and
breaks
and
thus
the
disease
spreads
the
hair
gets
matted
and
falls
off
regions
of
the
body
most
commonly
affected
head
chest
back
rump
and
extremities
there
may
not
be
much
constitutional
disturbance
from
the
actual
injury
to
the
skin
but
from
his
suffering
so
much
from
the
irritation
and
the
want
of
rest
the
health
suffers
avoid
the
use
of
disinfectants
most
of
those
sold
as
such
are
simply
deodorisers
and
applied
to
the
skin
are
useless
nor
are
they
of
much
use
in
cleaning
the
kennels
nothing
suits
better
for
woodwork
than
first
carbolic
wash
and
then
a
thorough
scrubbing
with
hot
water
and
garden
soap
some
ointment
must
be
used
to
the
skin
and
as
i
am
writing
for
laymen
only
i
feel
chary
in
recommending
such
strong
ones
as
the
green
iodide
of
mercury
if
you
do
use
it
mix
it
with
twice
its
bulk
of
the
compound
sulphur
ointment
do
over
only
a
part
or
two
at
a
time
the
dog
to
be
washed
after
three
days
but
the
compound
sulphur
ointment
itself
is
a
splendid
application
and
it
is
not
dangerous
skin
complaints
from
the
treatment
is
obvious
get
rid
of
the
cause
their
diagnosis
is
so
difficult
whenever
the
is
in
doubt
make
certain
by
treating
the
dog
not
only
by
local
applications
but
constitutionally
as
in
addition
to
good
diet
perfect
cleanliness
of
coat
kennel
and
all
surroundings
and
the
application
of
the
ointment
or
oil
let
the
dog
have
all
the
fresh
air
possible
and
exercise
but
never
or
too
fatiguing
then
a
course
of
arsenic
seldom
fails
to
do
good
i
do
not
believe
in
beginning
the
exhibition
of
arsenic
too
soon
i
prefer
paying
my
first
attentions
to
the
digestive
organs
and
state
of
the
bowels
the
form
of
exhibition
which
i
have
found
suit
as
well
as
any
is
the
liquor
it
is
easily
administered
it
ought
to
be
given
mixed
with
the
food
as
it
ought
to
enter
the
blood
with
the
chyle
from
the
diet
it
ought
day
by
day
to
be
gradually
not
hurriedly
increased
symptoms
of
loathing
of
food
and
redness
of
conjunctiva
call
for
the
cessation
of
its
use
for
two
or
three
days
at
least
when
it
is
to
be
recommended
at
the
same
size
of
dose
given
when
left
off
there
are
two
things
which
assist
the
arsenic
at
least
to
go
well
with
it
they
are
iron
in
some
form
and
virol
the
latter
will
be
needed
when
there
is
much
loss
of
flesh
a
simple
pill
of
sulphate
of
iron
and
extract
of
liquorice
may
be
used
dose
of
from
to

to
commence
with
gradually
increased
to
to
drops
a
scaly
or
scurfy
condition
of
the
skin
with
more
or
less
of

it
is
really
a
shedding
of
the
scaly
epidermis
brought
on
by
injudicious
feeding
or
want
of
exercise
as
a
primary
cause
the
dog
in
cases
of
this
kind
needs
cooling
medicines
such
as
small
doses
of
the
nitrate
and
chlorates
of
potash
perhaps
less
food
bowels
to
be
seen
to

very

tried
parasites
internal
worms
we
have
roughly
speaking
two
kinds
of
worms
to
treat
in
the
dog
the
round
and
the
tape
they
are
in
shape
and
size
not
unlike
the
garden
worm
but
harder
pale
and
pointed
sometimes
these
are
alarming
for
the
worm
itself
is
occasionally
seized
with
the
mania
for
foreign
travel
and
finds
its
way
into
the
throat
or
nostrils
causing
the
dog
to
become
perfectly
furious
and
inducing
such
pain
and
agony
that
it
may
seem
charity
to
end
its
life
the
worms
may
also
crawl
into
the
stomach
and
give
rise
to
great
irritation
but
are
usually
dislodged
therefrom
by
the
violence
accompanying
the
act
of
vomiting
their
usual
habitat
however
is
the
small
intestines
where
they
occasion
great
distress
to
their
host
the
appetite
is
always
depraved
and
voracious
at
times
there
is
colic
with
sickness
and
perhaps
vomiting
and
the
bowels
are
alternately
constipated
or
loose
the
coat
is
harsh
and
staring
there
usually
is
short
dry
cough
from
reflex
irritation
of
the
bronchial
mucous
membrane
a
breath
and
emaciation
or
at
least
considerable
poverty
of
flesh
the
disease
is
most
common
in
puppies
and
in
young
dogs
the
appearance
of
the
ascaris
in
the
dog
stools
is
of
course
diagnostic
symptom
i
have
cured
many
cases
with
santonin
and
powder
dose
grains
to
drachms
or
turpentine
dose
from
drops
to
drachms
beaten
up
with
yolk
of
egg
but
does
better
for
so
we
can
not
do
better
than
trust
to
pure
santonin
the
dose
is
from
grain
for
a
toy
up
to
grains
for
a
mastiff
mix
it
with
a

the

there
are

the
treatment
is

in
all
cases
the
commonest
in
the
country
is
the
cucumerine
this
is
a
of
about
fifteen
inches
in
average
length
although
i
have
taken
them
from
newfoundland
pups
fully
thirty
inches
long
it
is
a
entozoon

segment
is
long
compared
to
its
breadth
and
narrowed
at
both
ends
each
joint
has
when
detached
an
independent

existence
the
dog
often
becomes
infested
with
this
parasite
from
eating
brains
and
dogs
thus
afflicted
and
allowed
to
roam
at
pleasure
over
fields
and
hills
where
sheep
are
fed
sow
the
seeds
of
gid
in
our
flocks
to
any
extent
we
know
too
well
the
great
use
of
collie
dogs
to
the
shepherd
or
grazier
to
advise
that
dogs
should
not
be
employed
as
assistants
but
surely
it
would
be
to
their
owners
advantage
to
see
that
they
were
kept
in
a
state
of
health
and
cleanliness
we
ought
to
endeavour
to
prevent
as
well
as
to
cure
we
should
never
allow
our
dogs
to
eat
the
entrails
of
hares
or
rabbits
never
allow
them
to
be
fed
on
raw
sheep
intestines
nor
the
brains
of
sheep
never
permit
them
to
lounge
around
butchers
shops
nor
eat
offal
of
any
kind
let
their
food
be
well
cooked
and
their
skins
and
kennels
kept
scrupulously
clean
dogs
that
are
used
for
sheep
and
cattle
ought
twice
a
year
at
least
to
go
under
treatment
for
the
expulsion
of
worms
whether
they
are
infested
or
not
an
anthelmintic
would
make
sure
and
could
hardly
hurt
them
for
the
expulsion
of
we
depend
mostly
on
in
order
that
the
should
receive
the
full
benefit
of
the
remedy
we
order
a
dose
of
castor
oil
the
day
before
in
the
morning
and
recommend
no
food
to
be
given
that
day
except
or
mutton
broth
the
bowels
are
thus
empty
next
morning
so
that
the
parasite
can
not
shelter
itself
anywhere
and
is
therefore
sure
to
be
acted
on
infusion
of
cusco
is
sometimes
used
as
an
anthelmintic
so
is
wormwood
and
the
liquid
extract
of
male
fern
and
in
america
spigelia
root
and
pumpkin
seeds
the
best
tonic
to
give
in
cases
of
worms
is
the
extract
of
quassia

dusting
with

afterwards

this
may
not
kill
the
fleas
but
it
drives
them
off
take
the
dog
on
the
grass
while
dusting
and
begin
along
the
spine
never
do
it

the
house
ticks
i
have
noticed
these
disagreeable
bloodsuckers
only
on
the
heads
and
bodies
of
sporting
or
collie
dogs
who
had
been
boring
for
some
time
through
coverts
and
thickets
they
soon
make
themselves
visible
as
the
body
swells
up
with
the
blood
they
suck
until
they
resemble
small
soft
warts
about
as
big
as
a
pea
they
belong
to
the
natural
family
if
not
very
numerous
they
should
be
cut
off
and
the
part
touched
with
a
little
turps
the
sulphuret
of
calcium
will
also
kill
them
so
will
the
more
dangerous
white
precipitate
or
even
a
strong
solution
of
carbolic
acid
which
must
be
used
sparingly
however
lice
the
lice
are
hatched
from
nits
which
we
find
clinging
in
rows
and
very
tenaciously
too
to
the
hairs
the
insects
themselves
are
more
difficult
to
find
but
they
are
on
puppies
sometimes
in
thousands
to
destroy
them
i
have
tried
several
plans
oil
is
very
effectual
and
has
safety
to
recommend
it
common
sweet
oil
is
as
good
a
cure
as
any
and
you
may
add
a
little
oil
of
anise
and
some
sublimed
sulphur
which
will
increase
the
effect
quassia
water
may
be
used
to
damp
the
coat
the
matted
portions
of
a
dog
coat
must
be
cut
off
with
scissors
for
there
the
lice
often
lurk
the
oil
dressing
will
not
kill
the
nits
so
that
vinegar
must
be
used
after
a
few
days
the
dressing
must
be
repeated
and
so
on
three
or
four
times
to
do
any
good
the
whole
of
the
dog
coat
must
be
drenched
in
oil
and
the
dog
washed
with
good
dog
soap
and
warm
water
twelve
hours
afterwards
chapter
lii
the
dog
and
the
law
privileges
of
first
bite
it
is
popularly
but
rather
erroneously
supposed
that
dog
is
entitled
to
one
bite
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
state
that
every
dog
may
with
impunity
have
one
snap
or
one
intended
bite
but
only
dogs
of
hitherto
irreproachable
character
are
permitted
the
honour
of
a
genuine
tasteful
bite
once
a
dog
however
has
displayed
dangerous
propensities
even
though
he
has
never
had
the
satisfaction
of
effecting
an
actual
bite
and
once
his
owner
or
the
person
who
harbours
him
becomes
aware
of
these
evil
inclinations
scienter
either
of
his
own
knowledge
or
by
notice
the
law
looks
upon
such
dog
as
a
dangerous
beast
which
the
owner
keeps
at
his
peril
the
onus
of
proof
is
on
the
victim
to
show
that
the
owner
had
previous
knowledge
of
the
animal
ferocity
though
in
reality
very
little
evidence
of
scienter
is
as
a
rule
required
and
notice
need
not
necessarily
be
given
directly
to
the
owner
but
to
any
person
who
has
charge
of
the
dog
the
person
attacked
has
yet
another
remedy
he
can
if
he
is
able
kill
the
dog
before
it
can
bite
him
but
he
is
not
justified
in
shooting
the
animal
as
it
runs
away
even
being
bitten
by
and
the
owner
of
a
dog
which
attacks
sheep
or
cattle
and
cattle
includes
horses
is
responsible
for
all
damage
and
there
is
no
necessity
to
prove
previous
evil
propensities
this
act
is
wholly
repealed
by
the
act
called
the
dogs
act
which
came
into
force
on
january
but
the
new
act
the
section
having
reference
to
damage
to
cattle
and
says
that
in
such
cases
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
persons
claiming
damages
to
show
a
previous
mischievous
propensity
in
the
dog

such
previous
propensity

cattle
includes
horses

the
law
looks
upon
fighting
between
dogs
as
a
natural
and
necessary
incident
in
the
career
of
every
member
of
the
canine
race
and
gives
no
redress
to
the
owner
of
the
vanquished
animal

the
fight
was
a
fair
one
and
the
contestants
appear
to
consider
it

the
owner
however
of
a
peaceably
disposed
dog
which
is
attacked
and
injured
or
killed
by
one
savage
and
unrestrained
has
a
right
of
action
against
the
owner
of
the
latter
the
owner
of
the
peaceably
disposed
animal
may
justifiably
kill
the
savage
brute
in
order
to
save
his
dog
but
he
must
run
the
risk
of
being
able
to
prove
that
this
was
the
only
means
of
putting
a
stop
to
the

unquestionably
the
greatest
enemy
that
the
dog
possesses
at
the
present
time
is
the
motor
car
presuming
the
owner
of
the
dog
is
fortunate
enough
to
know
whose
car
it
was
that
ran
over
his
dog
and
to
have
some
evidence
of
excessive
or
unreasonable
speed
or
other
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
car
driver
at
the
time
of
the
accident
he
will
find
the
law
ever
ready
to
assist
him
a
dog
has
every
bit
as
much
right
to
the
high
road
as
a
motor
car
efforts
have
been
made
on
the
part
of
motor
owners
to
get
the
courts
to
hold
that
dogs
on
a
high
road
are
only
under
proper
control
if
on
a
lead
and
that
if
they
are
not
on
a
lead
the
owner
of
them
is
guilty
of
negligence
in
allowing
his
dog
to
stroll
about
and
therefore
is
not
entitled
to
recover
such
efforts
have
not
been
successful
even
supposing
a
court
to
hold
that
the
fact
of
a
dog
being
loose
in
this
way
or
unaccompanied
was
evidence
of
negligence
against
his
owner
this
would
by
no
means
defeat
his
owner
claim
for
the
law
is
that
though
a
plaintiff
may
have
been
negligent
in
some
such
way
as
this
yet
if
the
defendant
could
by
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
have
avoided
the
accident
the
plaintiff
can
still
recover
there
are
