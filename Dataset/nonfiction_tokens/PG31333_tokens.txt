the
assault
under
the
forms
of
law
which
is
being
made
upon
the
political
rights
of
the
negro
is
the
symptom
of
an
animus
which
has
its
roots
imbedded
in
the
past
it
does
not
mark
a
revival
but
rather
the
supreme
desperate
effort
of
the
spirit
of
tyranny
to
compass
the
political
subjection
and
consequent
social
degradation
of
the
black
man
its
provocation
does
not
consist
in
any
abnormal
or
perilous
condition
in
southern
communities
arising
from
a
numerical
preponderance
of
negroes
it
is
not
made
to
meet
a
merely
temporary
emergency
with
the
intent
to
return
to
the
principles
of
republican
government
upon
the
advent
of
intelligence
and
wealth
to
the
negro
indeed
the
very
intent
and
purpose
of
the
assault
is
to
prevent
such
an
advent
in
so
far
as
human
ingenuity
and
tyrannical
violence
can
do
so
it
can
not
find
its
justification
in
a
necessity
of
averting
by
radical
measures
any
imagined
perils
to
social
order
which
might
arise
from
the
political
domination
of
ignorance
for
the
spirit
which
prompts
the
assault
has
ever
fostered
ignorance
and
endeavored
to
perpetuate
it
in
fact
the
assault
is
so
iniquitous
in
its
conception
and
is
being
executed
with
such
wicked
and
violent
disregard
of
political
morals
and
human
rights
as
by
comparison
to
render
almost
beneficent
the
realization
of
the
perils
which
the
imagination
of
the
assailants
pretends
to
fancy
there
may
be
those
who
see
in
this
assault
nothing
more
than
a
supreme
effort
of
a
benign
civilization
to
save
itself
from
utter
ruin
it
is
however
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
apostles
of
this
civilization
which
is
of
a
peculiarly
local
type
have
ever
asserted
that
its
maintenance
and
future
glory
are
inseparably
connected
with
the
subjection
of
the
negro
always
they
have
spoken
the
language
of
tyranny
which
in
spite
of
its
embellishments
and
jugglings
amounts
to
this
the
social
and
political
privileges
of
the
negro
are
inconsistent
with
the
economic
interests
and
political
ambitions
of
a
few
southern
white
men
into
this
language
all
of
the
feigned
social
perils
and
political
nightmares
of
southern
planters
and
politicians
easily
resolve
themselves
there
may
be
those
who
indulge
the
hope
that
the
final
triumph
of
this
assault
will
have
a
salutary
effect
upon
the
social
status
of
the
negro
their
hope
is
due
in
no
small
measure
to
their
ignorance
of
the
history
of
the
character
spirit
and
dominant
purpose
of
the
assailants
that
history
furnishes
the
best
key
to
an
understanding
of
the
present
assault
upon
the
political
rights
of
the
negro
forty
years
ago
the
slave
power
plunged
this
nation
into
war
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
perpetuating
negro
slavery
alexander
stevens
on
his
return
from
the
convention
which
had
erected
the
southern
confederacy
addressing
a
large
assembly
at
savannah
uttered
the
following
significant
words
the
new
constitution
has
put
at
rest
forever
all
the
agitating
questions
relating
to
our
peculiar
institution
african
slavery
as
it
exists
among
us
status
of
the
negro
in
our
form
of
civilization
this
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
late
rupture
and
the
present
revolution
referring
to
the
ideas
of
thomas
jefferson
and
the
leading
statesmen
at
the
time
of
the
formation
of
the
federal
constitution
that
negro
slavery
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
wrong
in
principle
socially
morally
and
politically
he
continued
thus
those
ideas
were
fundamentally
wrong
they
rested
upon
the
assumption
of
the
equality
of
races
our
constitution
the
confederate
constitution
is
founded
upon
exactly
the
opposite
ideas
its
foundations
are
laid
its
corner
stone
rests
upon
the
great
truth
that
the
negro
is
not
equal
to
the
white
man
that
slavery
subordination
to
the
superior
race
is
his
natural
and
normal
condition
it
has
become
the
rule
to
frown
upon
any
and
all
references
to
the
circumstances
and
causes
that
produced
the
civil
war
this
is
true
especially
of
the
men
and
women
who
upheld
the
cause
of
the
union
as
against
secession
naturally
magnanimous
they
have
been
at
great
pains
to
avoid
in
their
public
utterances
any
references
to
the
late
unpleasantness
which
might
in
any
way
wound
the
sensibilities
of
the
excessively
sensitive
south
certainly
nothing
can
be
more
sincerely
desired
than
the
utter
eradication
of
the
passions
and
animosities
that
were
evoked
by
armed
conflict
but
to
ignore
the
fundamental
cause
and
motive
which
led
the
south
to
precipitate
the
war
with
a
view
to
seeming
not
to
be
influenced
by
sectional
prejudices
is
pushing
magnanimity
to
the
verge
of
vapid
sentimentality
a
folly
in
which
the
south
in
so
far
as
its
attitude
toward
the
negro
is
concerned
has
in
no
sense
shared
the
doctrine
of
the
proper
status
of
the
negro
is
as
consistently
maintained
by
the
south
in
eighteen
hundred
and
as
in
eighteen
hundred
and
sixty
when
it
was
made
the
shibboleth
of
the
slavery
party
and
the
tocsin
of
war
and
there
can
be
no
proper
consideration
of
our
present
negro
problem
without
regard
to
this
historical
doctrine
the
southern
confederacy
is
now
a
political
myth
in
its
attempt
to
make
negro
slavery
its
corner
stone
it
carved
the
gravestones
of
more
than
a
million
men
upon
the
proclamation
of
peace
and
universal
freedom
the
nation
joy
was
without
bounds
in
the
intense
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
over
the
new
birth
of
freedom
and
the
overthrow
of
the
slave
power
the
doctrine
of
the
proper
status
of
the
negro
seemed
to
be
eternally
repudiated
and
the
agitations
relating
to
it
seemed
indeed
forever
settled
but
in
the
throes
of
its
joy
there
suddenly
dawned
upon
the
nation
the
fact
that
the
problems
pertaining
to
the
negro
had
because
of
freedom
become
more
stupendous
than
even
the
question
of
slavery
had
been
henceforth
the
negro
problem
was
to
test
severely
the
integrity
of
republican
principles
this
was
the
critical
period
of
the
history
of
the
negro
in
america
within
almost
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
by
an
exigency
of
one
of
the
world
greatest
wars
his
status
had
been
suddenly
changed
the
slave
became
a
free
man
by
the
dispensation
of
providence
and
against
the
will
of
his
master
a
free
man
yet
penniless
and
homeless
a
man
of
toil
but
one
whose
own
and
whose
ancestral
toil
had
created
a
material
and
social
grandeur
which
now
mocked
at
his
poverty
and
arrogantly
denied
him
a
share
in
its
blessings
a
free
man
but
ignorant
the
greatest
curse
imposed
by
his
former
status
which
had
contributed
to
the
enlightenment
of
others
a
freeman
but
helpless
in
the
face
of
an
impending
persecution
he
whose
labor
had
contributed
to
the
comfort
and
social
happiness
of
others
who
while
they
were
testing
on
scores
of
battle
fields
their
power
to
rob
him
of
his
freedom
was
caring
for
and
protecting
their
wives
and
daughters
and
furnishing
the
sinews
of
the
unholy
war
was
now
at
the
mercy
of
those
who
had
gone
forth
to
battle
with
the
cry
that
slavery
subordination
to
the
superior
race
is
his
natural
and
normal
condition
the
thirteenth
amendment
became
the
law
of
the
land
through
the
travail
of
war
but
the
war
had
sapped
the
nation
strength
had
cost
nearly
a
million
lives
and
created
a
debt
of
three
billions
weary
of
strife
and
vexation
the
nation
was
fain
to
leave
the
settlement
of
the
problems
to
which
the
new
status
of
the
negro
had
given
rise
to
those
among
whom
he
was
to
live
to
his
former
masters
this
was
indeed
a
critical
period
in
the
history
of
the
negro
race
in
the
united
states
and
the
lessons
of
this
period
are
exceedingly
important
in
the
light
of
the
present
attack
upon
the
political
rights
of
the
black
man
in
recent
discussions
of
the
merits
and
wisdom
of
negro
suffrage
this
period
is
as
a
rule
strangely
overlooked
the
assertion
so
commonly
made
that
the
conferring
of
the
right
to
vote
upon
the
negro
was
a
colossal
blunder
evinces
the
extent
to
which
this
period
has
been
ignored
by
those
who
make
it
or
else
their
remarkable
ignorance
of
the
history
of
negro
suffrage
political
prejudices
and
the
blind
zeal
and
opportunism
of
those
who
have
discovered
some
sure
cure
for
the
negro
ills
have
aided
much
in
the
work
of
discrediting
negro
suffrage
some
have
ignored
the
facts
to
such
an
extent
as
to
assert
that
negro
suffrage
was
the
result
of
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
northerners
who
wished
both
to
humiliate
the
south
and
to
perpetuate
the
power
of
the
republican
party
the
trouble
with
this
assertion
is
that
it
imputes
too
much
to
northern
sagacity
what
the
nation
through
the
agency
of
the
republican
party
did
was
to
enact
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
thus
to
make
president
lincoln
conditional
proclamation
of
freedom
an
unconditioned
part
of
the
organic
law
the
extent
of
its
revenge
was
to
insist
upon
the
incorporation
of
this
principle
of
freedom
into
the
old
slave
constitutions
of
the
south
this
was
the
terms
of
surrender
and
having
accepted
this
the
south
was
left
alone
the
boon
it
has
always
craved
with
full
power
to
deal
with
the
negro
as
tenderly
as
it
saw
fit
the
negro
was
left
a
sojourner
on
sufferance
in
the
great
republic
which
he
had
assisted
in
saving
and
to
the
sweet
charity
of
those
who
had
sought
to
destroy
it
for
the
purpose
of
binding
him
with
unbreakable
chains
by
the
acceptance
of
the
terms
imposed
the
rebellious
states
placed
themselves
in
a
position
of
great
responsibility
and
great
opportunity
the
responsibility
of
the
old
south
the
south
of
slavery
and
rebellion
was
to
properly
adjust
itself
to
the
new
conditions
of
freedom
and
inseparable
union
its
opportunity
was
to
prove
to
the
nation
the
claim
it
so
often
and
so
boastfully
makes
that
it
is
the
negro
best
friend
and
is
disposed
to
treat
him
fairly
did
the
south
rise
to
its
opportunity
did
it
treat
liberally
and
kindly
those
freedmen
who
as
slaves
had
created
its
material
wealth
and
many
of
whom
as
soldiers
had
with
the
irony
of
fate
helped
to
keep
it
from
separating
from
the
union
of
which
it
is
now
proud
of
being
an
integral
part
did
it
hold
out
to
them
the
promise
of
gradual
citizenship
and
in
order
that
this
citizenship
should
be
intelligent
establish
schools
for
their
education
was
it
jealous
or
in
any
way
solicitous
about
the
economic
and
industrial
freedom
of
these
people
in
its
bearing
upon
the
present
disfranchising
enactments
of
the
south
the
answer
to
these
questions
is
important
unaccustomed
to
free
schools
trained
to
despise
and
punish
the
intellectual
aspirations
of
the
slave
these
recently
rebellious
states
not
only
refused
to
educate
the
freedmen
but
actually
burned
many
schools
that
were
built
by
men
and
women
of
the
north
who
in
obedience
to
genuine
christian
charity
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
armies
of
freedom
then
as
now
it
proceeded
to
fix
the
negro
status
by
hostile
legislation
in
the
shape
of
black
codes
these
laws
reveal
the
deliberate
purpose
of
the
south
to
reduce
the
freedmen
to
a
state
of
serfdom
more
bitter
and
degrading
than
slavery
had
been
and
violated
the
most
sacred
of
the
inherent
rights
of
human
nature
the
civilized
state
of
alabama
which
is
now
preparing
to
disfranchise
the
negro
declared
that
stubborn
and
refractory
servants
and
servants
who
loiter
away
their
time
were
to
be
treated
as
vagrants
fined
fifty
dollars
and
in
default
of
payment
might
be
hired
out
at
public
auction
for
a
period
of
six
months
thus
the
thirteenth
amendment
did
not
destroy
the
auction
block
florida
declared
that
it
shall
not
be
lawful
for
any

bowie
knife

or
ammunition
of
any
kind
without
license
to
be
granted
only
upon
the
recommendation
of
two
respectable
white
men
for
violating
this
law
the
negro
was
to
stand
in
the
pillory
for
one
hour
and
then
be
whipped
with
lashes
on
the
bare
back
south
carolina
always
bold
to
reveal
its
purpose
declared
that
no
person
of
color
shall
pursue
the
practice
art
trade
or
business
of
an
artisan
mechanic
shopkeeper
or
any
other
employment
besides
that
of
husbandry
or
that
of
a
servant
under
contract
for
labor
without
a
license
which
was
good
for
one
year
only
and
she
supplemented
this
with
the
following
that
a
person
of
color
who
is
in
the
employment
of
a
master
engaged
in
husbandry
shall
not
have
the
license

any
kind
or
any
other
product
of
a

without
written
permission
of
such
master
louisiana
which
has
recently
outlawed
the
negro
by
constitutional
enactment
declared
every
adult
freedman

shall
furnish

twenty
after

act
failing
to
do
so
such
persons
were
to
be
hired
out
at
public
auction
for
the
rest
of
the
year
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
laws
were
not
enactments
of
a
distant
and
forgotten
past
they
were
the
deliberate
enactments
of
that
period
for
the
purpose
of
nullifying
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
this
period
justice
miller
in
rendering
the
decision
in
the
slaughter
house
cases
said
the
process
of
restoring
to
their
proper
relations
with
the
federal
government
and
with
the
other
states
those
which
had
sided
with
the
rebellion
undertaken
under
the
proclamation
of
president
johnson
in
and
before
the
assembling
of
congress
developed
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
the
formal
recognition
by
those
states
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
condition
of
the
slave
race
would
without
further
protection
of
the
federal
government
be
almost
as
bad
as
it
was
before
among
the
first
acts
of
legislation
adopted
by
several
of
the
states
in
the
legislative
bodies
which
claimed
to
be
in
their
normal
relations
with
the
federal
government
were
laws
which
imposed
upon
the
colored
race
onerous
disabilities
and
burdens
and
curtailed
their
rights
in
the
pursuit
of
life
liberty
and
property
to
such
an
extent
that
their
freedom
was
of
little
value
while
they
had
lost
their
protection
which
they
had
received
from
their
former
owners
from
motives
both
of
interest
and
humanity
this
is
what
happened
to
the
negro
when
the
south
was
left
alone
to
deal
with
him
and
when
he
was
voteless
james
blaine
truly
said
that
without
the
right
of
citizenship
his
freedom
could
be
maintained
only
in
name
and
without
the
elective
franchise
his
citizenship
would
have
no
legitimate
and
no
authoritative
protection
fortunately
for
the
negro
and
for
the
continuance
of
free
institutions
in
the
south
the
nation
slowly
perceived
this
truth
but
not
until
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
had
been
carried
on
by
the
friends
of
freedom
for
manhood
suffrage
and
human
rights
these
infamous
repressive
and
enslaving
laws
finally
aroused
the
nation
sense
of
justice
and
brought
it
to
the
realization
of
the
undeniable
truth
that
in
a
free
government
the
strong
keen
sword
by
which
a
freeman
can
protect
all
other
rights
and
give
value
to
all
other
privileges
is
the
elective
franchise
yet
in
the
full
consciousness
of
this
truth
attested
beyond
cavil
by
the
inhuman
subjection
of
the
negro
to
the
arrogant
and
oppressive
will
of
those
who
held
peculiar
notions
about
his
proper
status
the
federal
government
hesitated
to
go
the
full
length
of
its
duty
it
stopped
midway
the
war
seemed
not
to
have
convinced
it
of
the
futility
and
fatality
of
compromising
with
the
south
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
the
negro
was
thereby
given
the
right
which
his
southern
guardians
proudly
refused
him
the
right
of
citizenship
but
not
the
right
which
is
alone
the
guarantee
of
the
privileges
of
citizenship
the
right
to
a
voice
in
the
government
of
which
he
was
declared
a
citizen
the
power
of
conferring
suffrage
limited
or
universal
was
left
as
the
special
privilege
of
the
south
but
the
south
proceeded
to
nullify
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
had
nullified
the
thirteenth
and
sent
her
captains
of
rebellion
to
make
the
nation
laws
impelled
by
the
motive
of
self
preservation
by
the
sheer
necessity
of
saving
itself
from
those
who
would
have
destroyed
it
and
of
saving
to
the
freedmen
the
simple
inherent
right
of
the
nation
was
forced
to
confer
upon
the
negro
the
right
to
vote
by
the
adoption
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
this
step
it
is
now
popular
to
characterize
as
a
blunder
or
as
an
act
of
revenge
designed
to
humiliate
the
south
if
it
was
then
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
the
abolition
of
slavery
are
nameless
crimes
the
period
of
reconstruction
has
served
as
the
text
for
discrediting
negro
suffrage
and
is
always
the
apt
illustration
that
gives
point
to
the
argument
of
those
who
attempt
to
prove
the
incapacity
of
the
negro
to
exercise
the
right
of
suffrage
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
effort
to
mould
public
sentiment
away
from
negro
suffrage
has
been
generally
successful
and
this
success
has
been
achieved
very
largely
through
misrepresentation
in
regard
to
the
facts
of
reconstruction
the
great
body
of
active
citizens
have
grown
into
full
citizenship
since
the
reconstruction
epoch
are
consequently
ignorant
of
its
true
history
and
quite
satisfied
to
receive
the
information
concerning
it
from
those
whose
interest
and
delight
it
is
to
resort
to
misrepresentation
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enter
into
a
defense
of
reconstruction
but
merely
to
call
attention
to
the
following
facts
the
attempt
to
reconstruct
the
rebellious
states
along
lines
of
republican
principles
failed
until
the
negro
was
given
the
right
to
vote
those
who
had
participated
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
and
to
whom
the
opportunity
had
been
given
to
return
to
normal
relations
with
the
federal
government
without
the
interference
of
the
negro
failed
signally
and
deliberately
to
do
so
in
an
acceptable
manner
negro
suffrage
was
therefore
an
essential
and
beneficent
factor
in
the
work
of
reconstruction
the
accepted
history
of
that
period
has
been
written
by
those
who
rode
into
power
by
murder
and
intimidation
and
to
whose
interest
it
is
to
paint
the
history
of
reconstruction
so
dark
as
to
hide
their
own
flagrant
crimes
their
method
of
history
writing
has
been
that
of
suppression
and
distortion
of
facts
the
true
history
of
that
period
reveals
some
things
that
place
negro
suffrage
in
a
remarkably
creditable
light
the
statement
has
recently
been
made
that
the
reconstruction
regime
in
the
south
worked
lasting
injury
to
the
colored
race
place
this
statement
in
juxtaposition
with
a
few
of
the
things
that
were
really
done
by
these
newly
enfranchised
people
who
were
practicing
their
first
lessons
in
the
science
of
government
judge
albion
tourgee
has
stated
it
thus
they
obeyed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
annulled
the
bonds
of
states
counties
and
cities
which
had
been
issued
to
carry
on
the
war
of
rebellion
and
maintain
armies
in
the
field
against
the
union
they
instituted
a
public
school
system
in
a
realm
where
public
schools
had
been
unknown
they
opened
the
ballot
box
and
jury
box
to
thousands
of
white
men
who
had
been
debarred
from
them
by
a
lack
of
earthly
possessions
they
introduced
home
rule
into
the
south
they
abolished
the
whipping
post
the
branding
iron
the
stocks
and
other
barbarous
forms
of
punishment
which
had
up
to
that
time
prevailed
they
reduced
capital
felonies
from
about
twenty
to
two
or
three
in
an
age
of
extravagance
they
were
extravagant
in
the
sums
appropriated
for
public
works
in
all
of
that
time
no
man
rights
of
person
were
invaded
under
the
forms
of
law
every
democrat
life
home
fireside
and
business
were
safe
no
man
obstructed
any
white
man
way
to
the
ballot
box
interfered
with
his
freedom
of
speech
or
boycotted
him
on
account
of
his
political
faith
this
is
the
record
which
it
is
said
has
worked
lasting
injury
to
the
colored
race
if
the
true
history
of
this
period
proves
anything
it
is
this
namely
that
the
only
republican
government
in
fact
as
well
as
in
form
that
has
ever
existed
in
the
south
was
when
the
negro
though
a
mere
tyro
in
the
art
of
government
was
a
controlling
factor
in
southern
politics
his
lasting
injury
consists
in
the
fact
that
he
planted
the
seeds
of
all
the
new
south
prosperity
the
southern
politicians
who
in
their
desperation
to
perpetuate
negro
slavery
created
a
national
debt
of
more
than
three
billions
and
stained
every
vale
and
hillside
with
the
blood
of
freemen
point
with
ineffable
horror
at
the
extravagant
financial
legislation
of
the
reconstruction
period
it
may
be
that
this
much
paraded
extravagance
amounts
to
more
than
the
fiction
of
distorted
facts
but
in
view
of
the
audacious
corruption
of
the
era
which
preceded
it
and
the
gigantic
peculations
of
that
which
has
followed
the
financial
profligacy
of
reconstruction
may
not
have
been
so
bad
after
all
replying
to
a
characteristic
speech
of
senator
tillman
delivered
in
the
recent
south
carolina
constitutional
convention
in
which
he
arraigned
the
financial
legislation
of
reconstruction
in
that
state
thomas
miller
one
of
the
six
negro
members
of
the
convention
said
the
gentleman
from
edgefield
tillman
speaks
of
the
piling
up
of
the
state
debt
of
jobbery
and
peculation
during
the
period
between
and
in
south
carolina
but
he
has
not
found
voice
eloquent
enough
nor
pen
exact
enough
to
mention
those
imperishable
gifts
bestowed
upon
south
carolina
between
and
by
negro
legislators
the
laws
relative
to
finance
the
building
of
penal
and
charitable
institutions
and
greatest
of
all
the
establishment
of
the
public
school
system
starting
as
infants
in
legislation
in
many
wise
measures
were
not
thought
of
many
injudicious
acts
were
passed
but
in
the
administration
of
affairs
for
the
next
four
years
having
learned
by
experience
the
result
of
bad
acts
we
immediately
passed
reformatory
laws
touching
every
department
of
state
county
municipal
and
town
governments
these
enactments
are
today
upon
the
statute
books
of
south
carolina
they
stand
as
living
witnesses
of
the
negro
fitness
to
vote
and
legislate
upon
the
rights
of
mankind
when
we
came
into
power
town
governments
could
lend
the
credit
of
their
respective
towns
to
secure
funds
at
any
rate
of
interest
that
the
council
saw
fit
to
pay
some
of
the
towns
paid
as
high
as
per
cent
we
passed
an
act
prohibiting
town
governments
from
pledging
the
credit
of
their
hamlets
for
money
bearing
a
greater
rate
of
interest
than
per
cent
up
to
inclusive
the
state
treasurer
had
the
power
to
pay
out
state
funds
as
he
pleased
he
could
elect
whether
he
would
pay
out
the
funds
on
appropriations
that
would
place
the
money
in
the
hands
of
the
peculators
or
would
apply
them
to
appropriations
that
were
honest
and
necessary
we
saw
the
evil
of
this
and
passed
an
act
making
specific
levies
and
collections
of
taxes
for
specific
appropriations
another
source
of
profligacy
in
the
expenditure
of
funds
was
the
law
that
provided
for
and
empowered
the
levying
and
collecting
of
special
taxes
by
school
districts
in
the
name
of
the
schools
we
saw
its
evil
and
by
a
constitutional
amendment
provided
that
there
should
only
be
levied
and
collected
annually
a
tax
of
two
mills
for
school
purposes
and
took
away
from
the
school
districts
the
power
to
levy
and
to
collect
taxes
of
any
kind
by
this
act
we
cured
the
evils
that
had
been
inflicted
upon
us
in
the
name
of
the
schools
settled
the
public
school
question
for
all
time
to
come
and
established
the
system
upon
an
honest
financial
basis
next
we
learned
during
the
period
from
to
inclusive
that
what
was
denominated
the
floating
indebtedness
covering
the
printing
schemes
and
other
indefinite
expenditures
amounted
to
nearly
a
conference
was
called
of
the
leading
negro
representatives
in
the
two
houses
together
with
the
state
treasurer
also
a
negro
after
this
conference
we
passed
an
act
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
bona
fide
floating
debt
and
found
that
it
did
not
amount
to
more
than
for
the
four
years
we
created
a
commission
to
sift
that
indebtedness
and
to
scale
it
hence
when
the
democratic
party
came
into
power
they
found
the
floating
debt
covering
the
legislative
and
all
other
expenditures
fixed
at
the
certain
sum
of
this
same
class
of
negro
legislators
led
by
the
state
treasurer
cardoza
knowing
that
there
were
millions
of
fraudulent
bonds
charged
against
the
credit
of
the
state
passed
another
act
to
ascertain
the
true
bonded
indebtedness
and
to
provide
for
its
settlement
under
this
law
at
one
sweep
those
entrusted
with
the
power
to
do
so
through
negro
legislators
stamped
six
millions
of
bonds
denominated
as
conversion
bonds
fraudulent
the
commission
did
not
finish
its
work
before
in
that
year
when
the
hampton
government
came
into
power
there
were
still
to
be
examined
into
and
settled
under
the
terms
of
the
act
passed
by
us
providing
for
the
legitimate
bonded
indebtedness
of
the
state
a
little
over
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
worth
of
bonds
and
coupons
which
had
not
been
passed
upon
governor
hampton
general
hagood
judge
simonton
judge
wallace
and
in
fact
all
of
the
conservative
thinking
democrats
aligned
themselves
under
the
provision
enacted
by
us
for
the
certain
and
final
settlement
of
the
bonded
indebtedness
and
appealed
to
their
democratic
legislators
to
stand
by
the
republican
legislation
on
the
subject
and
to
confirm
it
a
faction
in
the
democratic
party
obtained
a
majority
of
the
democrats
in
the
legislature
against
settling
the
question
and
they
endeavored
to
open
up
anew
the
whole
subject
of
the
state
debt
we
had
a
little
over
thirty
members
in
the
house
and
enough
republican
senators
to
sustain
the
hampton
conservative
faction
and
to
stand
up
for
honest
finance
or
by
our
votes
place
the
debt
question
of
the
old
state
into
the
hands
of
the
plunderers
and
peculators
we
were
appealed
to
by
general
hagood
through
me
and
my
answer
to
him
was
in
these
words
our
people
have
learned
the
difference
between
profligate
and
honest
legislation
we
have
passed
acts
of
financial
reform
and
with
the
assistance
of
god
when
the
vote
shall
have
been
taken
you
will
be
able
to
record
for
the
thirty
odd
negroes
slandered
though
they
have
been
through
the
press
that
they
voted
solidly
with
you
all
for
honest
legislation
and
the
preservation
of
the
credit
of
the
state
the
thirty
odd
negroes
in
the
legislature
and
their
senators
by
their
votes
did
settle
the
debt
question
and
saved
the
state
we
were
eight
years
in
power
we
had
built
school
houses
established
charitable
institutions
built
and
maintained
the
penitentiary
system
provided
for
the
education
of
the
deaf
and
dumb
rebuilt
the
jails
and
court
houses
rebuilt
the
bridges
and
the
ferries
in
short
we
had
reconstructed
the
state
and
placed
it
upon
the
road
to
prosperity
and
at
the
same
time
by
our
acts
of
financial
reform
transmitted
to
the
hampton
government
an
indebtedness
not
greater
by
more
than
than
was
the
bonded
debt
of
the
state
in
before
the
republican
negroes
and
their
white
allies
came
into
power
with
the
disgraceful
dicker
of
this
era
closed
and
with
it
passed
away
for
a
time
whose
limit
has
not
yet
been
fixed
whatever
there
has
been
of
republican
government
in
the
south
how
the
overthrow
of
reconstruction
government
was
accomplished
is
the
significance
of
its
overthrow
is
that
it
marked
the
arrogant
reassertion
of
the
malignant
and
desperate
purpose
of
the
southern
oligarchy
trained
in
the
absolutism
of
slave
mastery
to
despoil
the
negro
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
and
to
reduce
him
to
a
state
of
serfdom
in
the
preparation
for
the
execution
of
this
infamous
purpose
they
attempted
and
succeeded
in
accomplishing
what
does
great
credit
to
the
sheer
audacity
of
southern
political
leadership
by
sublime
dissimulation
they
hoodwinked
the
other
sections
of
the
country
in
regard
to
the
south
attitude
to
the
negro
their
first
maneuver
was
to
give
the
negro
a
bad
reputation
and
denounce
as
mischievous
meddlers
those
who
insisted
that
he
be
dealt
with
justly
the
southern
oligarchy
put
forward
its
youngest
and
best
men
its
first
point
of
attack
was
massachusetts
and
thither
went
grady
and
gordon
and
watterson
who
with
persuasive
accent
plead
the
cause
of
the
new
south
with
charming
recklessness
of
statement
they
proclaimed
the
era
of
sectional
fraternity
and
with
consummate
cunning
set
forth
in
the
next
breath
to
eastern
capitalists
the
industrial
possibilities
of
the
south
gradually
they
reached
the
climax
of
their
mission
to
wit
leave
the
negro
to
us
we
are
his
friends
his
natural
guardians
we
know
him
better
than
you
do
and
can
more
wisely
fix
his
status
in
our
social
scheme
then
the
old
old
story
was
repeated
with
endless
refrain
of
the
ignorance
criminal
tendencies
fully
attested
by
timely
news
dispatches
from
the
south
of
his
inferiority
and
of
the
menace
he
is
to
domination
thus
while
the
sons
of
slave
masters
were
poisoning
the
minds
of
the
north
and
west
the
slave
drivers
were
at
home
perfecting
the
conspiracy
against
negro
citizenship
the
year
witnessed
the
beginning
of
the
execution
of
this
conspiracy
which
promises
to
continue
until
the
negro
is
divested
of
every
right
which
is
worth
the
having
in
a
minority
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
mississippi
arrogated
to
themselves
the
right
to
despoil
the
majority
of
the
citizens
of
that
state
of
the
rights
of
free
men
by
nullifying
the
fifteenth
amendment
ii
before
considering
the
new
constitutions
of
the
states
of
mississippi
south
carolina
and
louisiana
and
the
decisions
of
courts
respecting
them
i
have
deemed
it
proper
to
review
the
history
of
negro
suffrage
and
to
indicate
the
unvarying
attitude
of
the
ruling
classes
of
the
south
towards
it
in
the
light
of
this
history
let
us
now
briefly
examine
these
recent
enactments
in
their
relation
to
the
political
rights
of
the
negro
it
is
no
secret
that
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
framers
of
these
instruments
was
to
deprive
the
negro
of
the
right
to
vote
their
purpose
is
not
more
startling
than
is
the
defiance
with
which
they
have
hurled
it
from
the
housetops
this
purpose
they
claim
to
have
accomplished
by
taking
advantage
of
the
ignorance
and
poverty
of
the
negro
but
the
most
cursory
glance
at
these
enactments
will
convince
any
one
that
neither
intelligence
nor
wealth
constitutes
the
basis
of
electoral
qualification
under
them
while
the
confessions
of
the
framers
of
them
as
well
as
their
operation
proves
that
neither
ignorance
nor
poverty
serves
to
disqualify
in
mississippi
a
negro
may
be
as
rich
as
dives
and
as
wise
as
solomon
and
yet
he
may
not
be
able
to
satisfy
an
ignorant
and
partisan
registration
officer
that
he
is
qualified
to
be
an
elector
while
a
white
man
may
be
as
poor
as
lazarus
and
may
not
possess
the
intellectual
outfit
of
a
hottentot
and
yet
he
will
experience
no
difficulty
in
convincing
the
same
individual
that
he
is
qualified
to
exercise
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
that
class
whose
destiny
it
is
to
dominate
this
is
the
sort
of
educational
qualifications
these
great
constitutional
documents
prescribe
how
to
disfranchise
the
negro
by
an
educational
test
without
at
the
same
time
disfranchising
a
very
large
number
of
white
men
was
at
first
a
problem
that
presented
many
difficulties
to
the
framers
of
the
mississippi
document
such
a
problem
however
can
not
long
remain
a
difficult
one
to
men
who
are
masters
of
the
art
of
legalizing
fraud
that
the
illiterate
white
vote
might
not
by
the
play
of
accident
become
eliminated
by
an
educational
test
it
was
provided
that
that
part
of
the

another

constitution
the
white
population
of

qualified
as

but
to
prevent
the
negroes
from
qualifying
section
of
article
further
provides
that
persons
offering
to
register
shall
take
the
following
oath
i
do
solemnly
swear
that
i
am
twenty
one
years
old
and
that
i
will
have
resided
in
the
state
two
years
and
this
election
district
for
one
year
preceding
the
ensuing
election
and
am
now
in
good
faith
a
resident
of
the
same
and
that
i
am
not
disqualified
from
voting
by
reason
of
having
been
convicted
of
any
of
the
crimes
mentioned
in
the
constitution
of
this
state
as
a
disqualification
to
be
an
elector
that
i
will
truly
answer
questions
propounded
to
me
concerning
my
antecedents
so
far
as
they
relate
to
my
right
to
and
also
as
to
residence
before
my
citizenship
in
this
that
i
will
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
will
bear
true
faith
and
allegiance
to
the
same
so
help
me
god
any
willful
and
corrupt
false
statement
in
said
affidavit
or
in
answer
to
any
material
question
propounded
as
herein
authorized
shall
be
perjury
in
the
foregoing
provisions
attention
is
called
to
the
following
the
crimes
mentioned
as
disqualifying
from
voting
are
such
as
it
is
always
easy
when
desirable
to
convict
the
negro
of
committing
under
the
present
method
of
administering
justice
in
the
states
where
these
disfranchising
constitutions
operate
the
negro
has
neither
any
guarantee
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
nor
any
protection
against
malicious
prosecution
or
false
accusations
when
it
is
convenient
to
convict
him
the
penalty
for
not
paying
taxes
almost
a
year
before
election
day
is
a
disqualification
from
voting
but
this
of
course
is
not
the
sole
penalty
whether
he
is
a
qualified
elector
or
not
every
man
must
in
the
case
of
real
property
pay
his
taxes
or
suffer
the
loss
of
his
property
and
certainly
no
man
not
even
the
poorest
of
the
negroes
and
poor
whites
can
escape
the
obligation
of
the
poll
tax
by
a
mere
forfeiture
of
his
right
to
vote
thus
the
penalty
for
not
paying
taxes
is
twofold
in
so
far
as
the
negro
is
concerned
the
poor
white
man
may
or
may
not
experience
any
difficulty
about
producing
to
the
officer
holding
the
election
satisfactory
evidence
that
he
has
paid
his
taxes
the
negro
who
may
desire
to
vote
must
answer
under
oath
not
certain
specific
interrogatories
concerning
his
antecedents
and
former
places
of
residence
but
to
truly
answer
all
questions
propounded
to
him
with
the
understanding
that
the
slightest
mistake
will
be
construed
as
a
corrupt
and
willful
false
statement
exposing
him
to
prosecution
for
perjury
thus
rendering
him
everlastingly
disqualified
to
vote
when
under
the
foregoing
provision
the
white
male
inhabitants
of
the
state
became
qualified
electors
the
following
provision
being
section
of
article
of
the
constitution
of
mississippi
went
into
operation
on
and
after
the
first
day
of
january
every
elector
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
qualifications
shall
be
able
to
read
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
this
state
or
shall
be
able
to
understand
the
same
when
read
to
him
or
give
a
reasonable
interpretation
thereof
this
section
contains
the
educational
test
and
the
qualifications
under
it
are
determined
by
a
registration
officer
whose
discretion
is
as
limitless
as
his
prejudices
the
registration
officers
of
south
carolina
acting
under
a
similar
provision
of
the
constitution
of
that
state
required
the
negroes
who
offered
themselves
for
registration
to
understand
and
explain
section
of
article
of
the
constitution
of
south
carolina
which
is
as
follows
the
supreme
courts
shall
have
power
to
issue
writs
or
orders
of
injunctions
mandamus
quo
warranto
prohibition
certiorari
habeas
corpus
and
other
original
and
remedial
writs
etc
fearing
apparently
that
these
provisions
of
the
constitution
might
not
prove
a
sufficient
barrier
to
the
negro
intellect
and
cunning
the
legislature
of
mississippi
has
gone
the
full
length
of
the
power
granted
it
in
its
efforts
to
keep
the
negro
from
voting
section
of
the
code
of
of
that
state
which
regulates
the
appointment
of
managers
of
elections
contains
this
remarkably
clever
provision
the
commissions
shall
appoint
three
persons
to
be
managers
of
election
who
shall
not
be
of
the
same
political
party
suitable
persons
of
different
political
parties
can
be
had
in
the
imagine
commissioners
of
election
of
the
mississippi
type
regarding
a
negro
or
a
white
man
known
to
be
favorable
to
negro
suffrage
as
a
suitable
person
one
would
suppose
that
the
elector
having
successfully
passed
the
ordeal
of
the
registration
officer
would
be
allowed
smooth
sailing
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
to
the
polls
but
no
having
passed
scylla
he
must
encounter
charybdis
at
the
very
brink
of
the
ballot
box
for
section
of
the
above
mentioned
code
provides
that
any
of
the
managers
of
election
may
examine
on
oath
any
person
duly
registered
and
offering
to
vote
touching
his
qualifications
as
an
elector
the
effect
of
the
constitution
of
mississippi
is
to
set
up
a
standard
of
qualification
of
a
much
higher
intellectual
scale
than
that
of
any
of
the
most
enlightened
states
in
the
union
and
to
deprive
a
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
citizens
of
the
elective
franchise
previously
enjoyed
by
them
the
attempt
is
often
made
by
southern
politicians
of
the
dominant
class
to
justify
the
mississippi
plan
of
disfranchisement
by
pointing
to
the
fact
that
massachusetts
a
northern
state
has
provided
for
a
qualified
suffrage
by
the
adoption
of
an
educational
test
but
compared
with
the
mississippi
provision
that
of
massachusetts
is
as
modest
and
simple
as
the
average
mississippi
school
house
amendment
xx
to
the
massachusetts
constitution
is
as
follows
no
person
shall
have
the
right
to
vote
or
be
eligible
to
office
under
the
constitution
of
this
commonwealth
who
shall
not
be
able
to
read
the
constitution
in
the
english
language
and
write
his
name
that
the
provisions
of
this
amendment
shall
not
apply
to
any
person
prevented
by
physical
disability
from
complying
with
its
requisition
to
any
person
who
now
has
the
right
to
nor
to
any
person
who
shall
be
sixty
years
of
age
or
upwards
at
the
time
this
amendment
shall
take
effect
thus
massachusetts
requires
that
those
wishing
to
exercise
the
elective
franchise
in
the
future
must
be
able
merely
to
read
the
english
language
and
expends
annually
more
than
four
dollars
per
capita
to
educate
them
while
mississippi
requires
not
only
future
electors
but
those
who
have
previously
exercised
the
right
to
vote
to
give
reasonable
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
registration
officer
and
expends
annually
less
than
one
dollar
per
capita
for
education
here
it
may
be
well
to
state
that
although
the
idea
of
a
qualified
suffrage
grew
out
of
the
desire
and
the
necessity
to
prepare
the
foreign
born
element
of
our
population
aliens
to
our
institutions
and
language
for
an
intelligent
exercise
of
the
ballot
the
negro
does
not
make
objection
or
complaint
to
a
just
and
fair
educational
test
of
his
fitness
to
exercise
the
right
of
suffrage
absolutely
loyal
to
republical
institutions
he
is
willing
to
go
as
far
as
any
in
the
matter
of
fairly
and
justly
protecting
the
ballot
from
abuses
that
grow
out
of
ignorance
the
constitution
of
mississippi
has
served
as
the
pattern
for
the
disfranchising
enactments
of
south
carolina
and
louisiana
the
main
provision
in
the
south
carolina
constitution
regulating
suffrage
is
as
follows
up
to
january
all
male
persons
of
voting
age
applying
for
registration
who
can
read
any
section
of
this
constitution
submitted
to
them
understand
and
explain
when
read
to
them
by
the
registration
officer
shall
be
entitled
to
registration
and
become
electors
it
will
be
observed
that
the
understanding
and
interpreting
clause
of
the
foregoing
operates
the
reverse
of
that
of
the
constitution
of
mississippi
the
south
carolina
provision
was
limited
to
cease
after
january
while
that
of
mississippi
was
limited
to
begin
january
and
to
continue
thereafter
without
ceasing
subdivision
d
of
the
above
mentioned
section
of
the
south
carolina
constitution
provides
as
follows
any
person
who
shall
apply
for
registration
after
january
if
otherwise
qualified
shall
be
registered
that
he
can
both
read
and
write
any
section
of
the
constitution
submitted
to
him
by
the
registration
officer
or
can
show
that
he
owns
and
has
paid
taxes
collectible
during
the
previous
year
on
property
in
this
state
assessed
at
three
hundred
dollars
or
more
subdivision
c
of
the
south
carolina
law
effected
the
disfranchisement
of
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
electors
who
had
passed
the
legal
age
of
attending
school
but
for
this
fact
the
provision
of
subdivision
d
if
fairly
applied
could
meet
with
no
objection
however
it
can
not
be
absolutely
fair
as
long
as
south
carolina
expends
less
money
per
capita
in
the
education
of
its
negro
population
than
in
the
education
of
its
white
population
the
report
of
the
superintendent
of
education
of
south
carolina
shows
that
it
has
cost
per
capita
to
educate
the
white
children
of
the
state
and
only
per
capita
to
educate
the
colored
children
when
the
present
constitution
of
south
carolina
was
in
process
of
construction
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
not
passed
upon
the
legality
of
the
educational
provision
of
the
mississippi
constitution
and
the
possibility
that
it
might
in
the
near
future
declare
all
such
enactments
repugnant
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
deterred
the
members
of
the
south
carolina
constitutional
convention
from
going
the
full
length
of
the
mississippi
plan
although
they
had
assembled
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
disfranchise
the
negro
yet
out
of
fear
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
they
failed
to
do
all
they
purposed
george
tillman
the
brother
of
the
present
united
states
senator
from
that
state
spoke
in
the
convention
the
following
significant
and
pathetic
words
president
we
can
all
hope
a
great
deal
from
the
constitution
we
have
adopted
it
is
not
such
an
instrument
as
we
would
have
made
had
we
been
a
free
people
we
are
not
a
free
people
we
have
not
been
since
the
war
i
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
we
can
call
ourselves
free
i
have
had
that
fact
very
painfully
impressed
upon
me
for
several
years
we
were
free
instead
of
having
negro
suffrage
we
would
have
negro
slavery
instead
of
having
the
united
states
government
we
would
have
the
confederate
states
government
instead
of
paying
pension
tribute
we
would
be
receiving
the
constitution
of
louisiana
in
its
attempt
to
disfranchise
the
negro
and
enfranchise
so
to
speak
every
other
class
of
men
the
ignorant
scum
of
europe
as
well
as
the
intelligent
and
illiterate
native
born
whites
outdoes
both
mississippi
and
south
carolina
it
adopts
practically
the
same
educational
and
property
qualifications
as
are
contained
in
the
mississippi
and
south
carolina
instruments
the
fifth
section
of
it
furnishes
a
true
index
to
the
spirit
which
is
behind
all
of
these
disfranchising
enactments
with
vindictive
memory
the
framers
of
the
louisiana
constitution
qualified
as
electors
all
who
were
entitled
to
vote
on
january
or
at
any
date
prior
thereto
as
well
as
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
such
persons
whether
or
not
they
possess
intelligence
or
property
herein
they
display
the
same
spirit
which
refused
to
accord
to
the
negro
the
right
to
vote
previous
to
what
has
been
the
attitude
of
the
courts
towards
these
enactments
which
in
the
interest
of
oligarchy
have
set
aside
republican
governments
in
the
south
and
nullified
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
naturally
the
state
courts
have
upheld
them
the
most
remarkable
judicial
utterance
since
the
famous
dred
scott
decision
is
that
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
the
case
of
ratliff
beale
predicated
upon
the
constitution
of
mississippi
respecting
the
elective
franchise
the
court
said
within
the
field
of
permissible
action
under
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
federal
constitution
the
convention
swept
the
circle
of
expedients
to
obstruct
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
by
the
negro
race
by
reason
of
its
previous
condition
of
servitude
and
dependence
this
race
had
acquired
or
accentuated
certain
peculiarities
of
habit
of
temperament
and
character
which
clearly
distinguished
it
as
a
race
from
that
of
the
whites
a
patient
docile
people
careless
landless
and
migratory
within
narrow
limits
without
forethought
and
its
criminal
members
given
rather
to
furtive
offenses
than
to
the
robust
crimes
of
the
whites
by
the
federal
constitution
from
discriminating
against
the
negro
race
the
convention
discriminated
against
its
characteristics
and
the
offenses
to
which
its
weaker
members
were
thus
a
court
created
by
this
new
constitution
of
mississippi
declares
that
it
in
spite
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
discriminates
against
the
negro
race
by
reason
of
its
previous
condition
of
servitude
and
dependence
and
at
the
same
time
upholds
that
instrument
the
constitutionality
of
these
disfranchising
enactments
has
not
been
made
a
direct
issue
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
case
of
williams
state
of
mississippi
the
decision
of
which
is
commonly
supposed
to
have
sustained
their
constitutionality
only
brought
the
question
up
collaterally
without
proper
allegations
or
sufficient
proof
from
an
intimation
made
by
the
court
in
this
case
it
is
not
improbable
that
when
a
direct
issue
upon
their
constitutionality
is
properly
presented
it
may
render
a
decision
consonant
with
that
which
it
rendered
in
the
case
of
yick
wo
hopkins
wherein
the
court
said
though
the
law
in
itself
be
fair
on
its
face
and
impartial
in
appearance
yet
if
it
be
applied
and
administered
by
public
authority
with
an
evil
eye
and
an
unequal
hand
so
as
to
practically
make
unjust
and
illegal
discriminations
between
persons
in
similar
circumstances
material
to
their
rights
the
denial
of
equal
justice
is
still
within
the
prohibition
of
the
constitution
there
are
other
grounds
for
the
belief
that
the
federal
supreme
court
will
refuse
to
sustain
these
instruments
of
disfranchisement
even
though
it
has
not
of
recent
years
acted
in
a
manner
to
inspire
faith
these
enactments
have
never
received
the
approval
of
the
people
of
the
states
of
a
total
of
male
citizens
of
voting
age
in
south
carolina
in
more
than
of
whom
were
white
men
only
participated
in
the
election
of
november
at
which
the
members
of
the
constitutional
convention
were
elected
of
the
number
thus
voting
only
were
counted
in
favor
of
holding
the
convention
thus
of
the
citizens
called
a
convention
and
enacted
a
constitution
which
disfranchised
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
electors
the
constitutions
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
were
adopted
in
the
same
way
these
so
called
constitutions
besides
being
repugnant
to
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
are
also
violative
of
the
acts
of
congress
restoring
the
rebellious
states
to
the
union
which
acts
the
federal
supreme
court
has
on
several
occasions
declared
constitutional
pursuant
to
the
reconstruction
legislation
these
states
adopted
constitutions
admitting
the
negro
to
the

iii
what
effect
have
these
disfranchising
enactments
had
upon
the
status
of
the
negro
has
he
lost
nothing
more
than
the
bare
right
to
vote
has
he
been
deprived
of
nothing
but
an
abstract
right
to
a
voice
in
the
affairs
of
government
and
of
no
other
privilege
than
the
possibility
of
a
share
of
political
power
surely
the
loss
of
any
one
of
the
foregoing
is
not
unimportant
in
a
democratic
form
of
government
but
he
has
lost
much
more
and
the
probabilities
are
that
if
these
obvious
discriminations
are
allowed
to
continue
he
will
be
brought
to
his
deepest
humiliation
the
law
which
deprives
him
of
the
badge
of
citizenship
changes
at
once
his
legal
status
and
cuts
him
off
from
respect
his
disqualification
as
an
elector
shuts
him
out
of
the
jury
box
in
courts
where
what
few
rights
he
has
left
are
adjudicated
and
his
grievances
redressed
his
disqualification
as
an
elector
and
as
a
juror
discredits
him
as
a
witness
in
the
states
which
have
adopted
these
disfranchising
constitutions
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
citizens
have
been
thereby
disqualified
as
jurors
this
is
all
the
more
outrageous
because
in
the
same
states
advantage
has
been
taken
in
criminal
legislation
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
has
termed
certain
peculiarities
of
habit
and
character
of
the
negro
whereby
furtive
offenses
which
in
other
communities
are
treated
as
mere
misdemeanors
are
made
felonies
and
are
usually
visited
with
greater
punishment
than
are
the
robust
crimes
of
the
whites
in
south
carolina
for
instance
the
breach
of
a
labor
contract
has
been
made
a
crime
the
object
being
to
reduce
the
negro
to
a
state
of
serfdom
not
only
has
the
legal
status
of
the
negro
been
gravely
affected
by
these
disfranchising
enactments
his
economic
status
has
also
been
lowered
a
mississippian
states
the
following
as
the
reason
for
disfranchising
the
negro
in
his
state
it
is
a
question
of
political
economy
which
the
people
of
the
north
can
not
realize
nor
understand
which
they
have
no
right
to
discuss
as
they
have
no
power
to
if
the
negro
is
permitted
to
engage
in
politics
his
usefulness
as
a
laborer
is
at
an
end
can
no
longer
be
controlled
or
the
south
has
to
deal
with
him
as
an
industrial
and
economic
factor
and
forced
to
assert
its
control
over
him
in
sheer
thus
negro
labor
must
be
managed
and
control
must
be
asserted
over
him
his
possession
of
the
ballot
would
make
him
a
free
laborer
and
would
enable
him
to
demand
the
wages
of
free
labor
it
is
truly
an
economic
problem
in
which
not
only
the
negro
of
the
south
is
concerned
but
also
the
interests
of
free
labor
in
every
section
of
this
country
these
disfranchising
enactments
in
that
they
lower
the
legal
and
economic
status
of
the
black
man
also
tend
to
lower
his
educational
and
social
status
the
political
and
economic
supremacy
of
the
southern
oligarchy
is
dependent
upon
the
ignorance
and
the
social
degradation
of
the
negro
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
the
politicians
now
dominant
in
the
south
assert
that
education
disqualifies
him
as
a
field
hand
as
a
manageable
factor
and
that
consequently
there
must
be
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
money
expended
for
his
education
or
that
his
education
must
be
directed
along
lines
which
will
make
him
more
adaptable
to
management
as
an
economic
factor
for
their
sole
benefit
the
educated
negro
is
not
more
desirable
now
than
he
was
fifty
years
ago
it
is
a
marvel
how
the
great
body
of
southern
white
people
a
great
many
of
whom
are
favorable
to
the
advancement
of
the
negro
will
permit
men
of
the
type
of
the
average
politicians
who
now
exercise
control
among
them
to
stand
thus
in
the
way
of
the
true
progress
of
the
south
first
it
is
asserted
that
the
right
to
vote
destroys
his
usefulness
as
a
laborer
then
that
education
turns
his
head
and
makes
him
discontented
with
the
plantation
where
wages
reach
the
high
water
mark
of
six
dollars
a
month
which
may
or
may
not
be
paid
according
to
the
whim
of
his
employer
and
finally
that
the
privilege
of
respectable
accommodations
furnished
by
common
carriers
which
enjoy
unusual
public
franchises
makes
him
impudent
noisy
and
the
proper
remedy
for
which
is
a
system
of
jim
crow
cars
thus
with
the
passing
away
of
the
negro
right
to
vote
begins
the
reappearance
of
the
odious
system
of
black
laws
which
are
designed
to
degrade
the
womanhood
and
manhood
of
the
negro
race
the
whole
trend
of
southern
legislation
is
to
fix
what
has
been
termed
the
proper
status
of
the
negro
subordination
to
the
superior
race
not
a
single
line
has
been
written
upon
the
statute
books
of
a
single
southern
state
within
the
last
decade
in
recognition
of
the
negro
as
a
man
entitled
to
respect
or
fair
and
just
consideration
in
lincoln
uttered
the
following
words
in
reference
to
slavery
which
are
not
wanting
in
significance
in
their
bearing
upon
the
present
assault
upon
the
negro
to
aid
in
making
the
bondage
of
the
negro
universal
and
eternal
it
the
declaration
of
independence
is
assailed
and
sneered
at
construed
and
hawked
at
and
torn
till
if
the
framers
could
rise
from
their
graves
they
would
hardly
recognize
it
all
the
powers
of
earth
seem
combined
against
him
ambition
follows
philosophy
follows
and
the
theology
of
the
day
is
fast
joining
in
the
cry
they
have
him
in
his
prison
house
they
have
searched
his
person
and
left
no
prying
instrument
with
him
and
now
they
have
him
as
it
were
bolted
with
a
lock
of
a
hundred
keys
which
can
never
be
unlocked
except
by
the
concurrence
of
every
key
in
the
hands
of
a
hundred
different
men
and
they
scattered
to
a
hundred
different
places
and
now
they
stand
musing
as
to
what
invention
in
all
the
domain
of
mind
and
matter
can
be
produced
to
make
the
impossibility
of
his
escape
more
complete
than
it
is
iv
the
nation
can
not
put
up
with
many
more
of
these
instruments
of
disfranchisement
it
can
not
endure
the
present
ones
very
much
longer
the
question
is
ceasing
to
be
one
of
interest
merely
to
the
negro
it
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
national
moment
it
is
becoming
a
contest
between
democracy
and
oligarchy
in
which
the
stability
and
integrity
of
republican
institutions
are
involved
already
a
few
thousand
minions
of
oligarchy
are
exerting
a
larger
influence
in
the
national
government
than
do
millions
of
freemen
who
are
obeying
the
federal
constitution
by
maintaining
a
republican
form
of
government
the
election
returns
from
the
three
states
of
louisiana
south
carolina
and
mississippi
show
how
startling
is
the
power
which
they
exercise
in
congress
by
reason
of
these
disfranchising
instruments
the
following
shows
the
number
of
votes
polled
in
these
states
for
members
of
congress
in
and
in
the
case
of
louisiana
the
votes
polled
may

can
not
permit
these
violent
infringements
of
the
principles
of
republican
government
to
continue
without
irrevocable
detriment
to
their
best
and
highest
interests
in
the
degree
that
they
stand
by
in
silence
and
see
the
negro
stripped
of
his
civil
and
political
rights
by
a
band
of
unscrupulous
men
who
seek
no
higher
end
than
their
personal
aggrandizement
they
compromise
their
own
civil
and
political
freedom
and
put
in
jeopardy
the
industrial
progress
of
the
south
the
bane
of
the
south
today
is
her
selfish
and
misguided
political
leadership
the
men
who
will
not
scruple
to
sacrifice
upon
the
altars
of
their
insatiable
ambition
for
power
every
interest
linked
with
her
economic
prosperity
and
all
consideration
for
civic
virtue
by
which
alone
the
greatness
of

people
is
measured
her
misfortune
lies
not
in
any
danger
from
negro
domination
for
of
all
the
classes
of
her
population
the
negro
is
the
least
capable
of
working
her
injury
and
the
least
disposed
to
do
so
her
real
danger
lies
in
the
pernicious
activity
of
her
dominant
political
leaders
who
perpetuate
their
control
by
overriding
local
and
national
authority
to
the
diminution
of
both
public
and
private
security
law
has
been
dethroned
and
the
respectable
and
industrious
portion
of
the
people
must
witness
the
spectacle
and
endure
the
humiliation
of
riot
bloodshed
and
assassination
with
impunity
of
innocent
and
unoffending
citizens
by
the
beneficiaries
under
these
disfranchising
constitutions
the
leading
paper
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
threw
the
weight
of
its
influence
in
favor
of
the
constitutional
convention
which
was
held
for
the
sole
and
avowed
purpose
of
disfranchising
the
negro
has
recently
made
the
following
important
confession
assassination
is
still
the
order
of
the
day
and
night
in
tangipahoa
parish
william
mcgee
a
white
man
employed
at
a
saw
mill
was
the
victim
he
was
waylaid
yesterday
morning
and
fired
upon
with
the
result
that
he
was
badly
hurt
a
posse
turned
out
with
dogs
to
find
the
murderers
but
to
no
purpose
although
the
posse
was
fired
on
several
times
out
of
ambush
the
authorities
in
that
parish
seem
incapable
of
making
arrests
of
the
perpetrators
of
these
numerous
assassinations
that
occur
among
them
but
when
by
some
chance
an
arrest
is
made
no
jury
is
found
that
will
convict
the
result
is
that
outlaws
have
everything
their
own
way
while
the
peaceable
people
have
no
assurance
that
at
any
moment
they
will
not
be
murdered
by
cowardly
assassins
thus
it
is
that
the
southern
white
people
by
permitting
a
few
desperate
politicians
to
outlaw
the
negro
find
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
an
oligarchy
which
has
everything
its
own
way
according
to
the
census
of
there
are
white
male
citizens
of
voting
age
in
south
carolina
and
colored
male
citizens
of
voting
age
making
a
total
of
male
citizens
who
were
entitled
to
vote
in
that
year
the
election
returns
from
that
state
for
november
show
that
the
highest
total
vote
polled
for
any
office
was
only
averaging
less
than
eight
hundred
votes
to
each
county
thus
showing
that
less
than
one
eighth
of
the
male
citizens
have
it
in
their
power
to
control
the
administration
and
policies
of
the
state
if
by
a
mere
technicality
one
class
of
citizens
can
be
deprived
of
the
rights
and
immunities
guaranteed
by
the
organic
law
of
the
nation
what
is
to
prevent
any
other
class
from
sharing
the
same
fate
if
less
than
one
fourth
of
the
male
citizens
of
mississippi
can
usurp
the
right
to
exclusively
manage
the
local
government
what
is
to
prevent
a
smaller
proportion
from
doing
the
same
if
it
is
possible
for
a
minority
of
the
people
of
alabama
to
disfranchise
one
class
of
citizens
on
account
of
race
without
the
consent
of
the
majority
what
is
to
prevent
the
disfranchisement
of
any
other
class
on
account
of
views
southern
white
men
who
view
with
apprehension
these
untoward
political
tendencies
who
are
alarmed
at
the
passing
away
of
the
last
vestiges
of
a
republican
form
of
government
from
that
section
of
our
union
and
who
silently
condemn
and
deplore
the
outrageous
and
inexcusable
manner
in
which
the
black
man
is
being
divested
of
his
political
and
civil
rights
for
mere
party
advantage
must
seriously
and
actively
face
the
situation
if
they
would
save
the
south
from
the
shame
and
the
humiliation
with
which
she
is
threatened
and
which
she
has
already
too
keenly
experienced
at
the
hands
of
a
profligate
leadership
there
is
a
dormant
statesmanship
in
the
south
that
must
and
will
exert
itself
mightily
a
moral
and
intellectual
intelligence
which
is
not
going
to
be
much
longer
beguiled
out
of
its
moral
right
of
way
by
questions
of
political
punctilio
but
will
seek
that
plane
of
universal
justice
and
equity
which
it
is
every
people
duty
before
god
to
seek
but
the
question
is
not
a
sectional
one
the
whole
american
people
are
deeply
concerned
in
it
nullification
in
south
carolina
is
as
great
a
national
menace
today
as
it
proved
to
be
half
a
century
ago
republican
institutions
and
the
national
welfare
can
have
no
guarantee
or
protection
against
the
evil
consequences
threatened
by
defiant
trampling
upon
constitutional
authority
not
in
its
most
palmy
days
did
the
slave
system
possess
such
power
as
is
aimed
at
by
these
latter
day
nullifiers
having
shorn
the
negro
of
his
political
rights
and
brought
him
into
industrial
subjection
thereby
usurping
power
both
in
state
and
national
government
they
now
threaten
to
dominate
the
economic
and
industrial
policies
of
the
nation
this
government
can
not
long
continue
half
republican
