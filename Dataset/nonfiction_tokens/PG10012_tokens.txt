of
california
mountains
are
ever
in
sight
charming
and
glorifying
every
landscape
yet
so
simple
and
massive
is
the
topography
of
the
state
in
general
views
that
the
main
central
portion
displays
only
one
valley
and
two
chains
of
mountains
which
seem
almost
perfectly
regular
in
trend
and
height
the
coast
range
on
the
west
side
the
sierra
nevada
on
the
east
these
two
ranges
coming
together
in
curves
on
the
north
and
south
inclose
a
magnificent
basin
with
a
level
floor
more
than
miles
long
and
from
to
miles
wide
this
is
the
grand
central
valley
of
california
the
waters
of
which
have
only
one
outlet
to
the
sea
through
the
golden
gate
but
with
this
general
simplicity
of
features
there
is
great
complexity
of
hidden
detail
the
coast
range
rising
as
a
grand
green
barrier
against
the
ocean
from
to
feet
high
is
composed
of
innumerable
spurs
ridges
and
rolling
which
inclose
a
multitude
of
smaller
valleys
some
looking
out
through
long
vistas
to
the
sea
others
with
but
few
trees
to
the
central
valley
while
a
thousand
others
yet
smaller
are
embosomed
and
concealed
in
mild
hills
each
with
its
own
climate
soil
and
productions
making
your
way
through
the
mazes
of
the
coast
range
to
the
summit
of
any
of
the
inner
peaks
or
passes
opposite
san
francisco
in
the
clear
springtime
the
grandest
and
most
telling
of
all
california
landscapes
is
outspread
before
you
at
your
feet
lies
the
great
central
valley
glowing
golden
in
the
sunshine
extending
north
and
south
farther
than
the
eye
can
reach
one
smooth
flowery
bed
of
fertile
soil
along
its
eastern
margin
rises
the
mighty
sierra
miles
in
height
reposing
like
a
smooth
cumulous
cloud
in
the
sunny
sky
and
so
gloriously
colored
and
so
luminous
it
seems
to
be
not
clothed
with
light
but
wholly
composed
of
it
like
the
wall
of
some
celestial
city
along
the
top
and
extending
a
good
way
down
you
see
a
pale
belt
of
snow
and
below
it
a
belt
of
blue
and
dark
purple
marking
the
extension
of
the
forests
and
along
the
base
of
the
range
a
broad
belt
of
and
yellow
where
lie
the
and
the
gardens
all
these
colored
belts
blending
smoothly
make
a
wall
of
light
ineffably
fine
and
as
beautiful
as
a
rainbow
yet
firm
as
adamant
when
i
first
enjoyed
this
superb
view
one
glowing
april
day
from
the
summit
of
the
pacheco
pass
the
central
valley
but
little
trampled
or
plowed
as
yet
was
one
furred
rich
sheet
of
golden
compositae
and
the
luminous
wall
of
the
mountains
shone
in
all
its
glory
then
it
seemed
to
me
the
sierra
should
be
called
not
the
nevada
or
snowy
range
but
the
range
of
light
and
after
ten
years
spent
in
the
heart
of
it
rejoicing
and
wondering
bathing
in
its
glorious
floods
of
light
seeing
the
sunbursts
of
morning
among
the
icy
peaks
the
noonday
radiance
on
the
trees
and
rocks
and
snow
the
flush
of
the
alpenglow
and
a
thousand
dashing
waterfalls
with
their
marvelous
abundance
of
irised
spray
it
still
seems
to
me
above
all
others
the
range
of
light
the
most
divinely
beautiful
of
all
the
i
have
ever
seen
the
sierra
is
about
miles
long
miles
wide
and
from
to
nearly
feet
high
in
general
views
no
mark
of
man
is
visible
on
it
nor
anything
to
suggest
the
richness
of
the
life
it
cherishes
or
the
depth
and
grandeur
of
its
sculpture
none
of
its
magnificent
ridges
rises
much
above
the
general
level
to
publish
its
wealth
no
great
valley
or
lake
is
seen
or
river
or
group
of
features
of
any
kind
standing
out
in
distinct
pictures
even
the
so
clear
and
high
in
the
sky
seem
comparatively
smooth
and
featureless
nevertheless
glaciers
are
still
at
work
in
the
shadows
of
the
peaks
and
thousands
of
lakes
and
meadows
shine
and
bloom
beneath
them
and
the
whole
range
is
furrowed
with
cañons
to
a
depth
of
from
to
feet
in
which
once
flowed
majestic
glaciers
and
in
which
now
flow
and
sing
a
band
of
beautiful
rivers
though
of
such
stupendous
depth
these
famous
cañons
are
not
raw
gloomy
gorges
savage
and
inaccessible
with
rough
passages
here
and
there
they
still
make
delightful
pathways
for
the
mountaineer
conducting
from
the
fertile
lowlands
to
the
highest
icy
fountains
as
a
kind
of
mountain
streets
full
of
charming
life
and
light
graded
and
sculptured
by
the
ancient
glaciers
and
presenting
throughout
all
their
courses
a
rich
variety
of
novel
and
attractive
scenery
the
most
attractive
that
has
yet
been
discovered
in
the
of
the
world
in
many
places
especially
in
the
middle
region
of
the
western
flank
of
the
range
the
main
cañons
widen
into
spacious
valleys
or
parks
diversified
like
artificial
with
charming
groves
and
meadows
and
thickets
of
blooming
bushes
while
the
lofty
retiring
walls
infinitely
varied
in
form
and
sculpture
are
fringed
with
ferns
of
many
species
oaks
and
evergreens
which
find
anchorage
on
a
thousand
narrow
steps
and
benches
while
the
whole
is
enlivened
and
made
glorious
with
rejoicing
streams
that
come
dancing
and
foaming
over
the
sunny
brows
of
the
cliffs
to
join
the
shining
river
that
flows
in
tranquil
beauty
down
the
middle
of
each
one
of
them
the
walls
of
these
park
valleys
of
the
yosemite
kind
are
made
up
of
rocks
mountains
in
size
partly
separated
from
each
other
by
narrow
gorges
and
and
they
are
so
sheer
in
front
and
so
compactly
built
together
on
a
level
floor
that
comprehensively
seen
the
parks
they
inclose
look
like
immense
halls
or
temples
lighted
from
above
every
rock
seems
to
glow
with
life
some
lean
back
in
majestic
repose
others
absolutely
sheer
or
nearly
so
for
thousands
of
feet
advance
their
brows
in
thoughtful
attitudes
beyond
their
companions
giving
welcome
to
storms
and
calms
alike
seemingly
conscious
yet
heedless
of
everything
going
on
about
them
awful
in
stern
majesty
types
of
permanence
yet
associated
with
beauty
of
the
frailest
and
most
fleeting
forms
their
feet
set
in
and
gay
emerald
meadows
their
brows
in
the
sky
bathed
in
light
bathed
in
floods
of
singing
water
while
avalanches
and
the
winds
shine
and
surge
and
wreathe
about
them
as
the
years
go
by
as
if
into
these
mountain
mansions
nature
had
taken
pains
to
gather
her
choicest
treasures
to
draw
her
lovers
into
close
and
confiding
communion

coniferous
forests
in
the

both
in
the
number
of
its

in
the

beauty
of
its

in
melody
through

of
about
fifteen

bears

the
zone
along
the
base
of
the
range
comprehends
nearly
all
the
famous
gold
region
of
california
and
here
it
was
that
miners
from
every
country
under
the
sun
assembled
in
a
wild
rush
to
seek
their
fortunes
on
the
banks
of
every
river
ravine
and
gully
they
have
left
their
marks
every
and
has
been
desperately
riddled
over
and
over
again
but
in
this
region
the
pick
and
shovel
once
wielded
with
savage
enthusiasm
have
been
laid
away
and
only
is
now
being
carried
on
to
any
considerable
extent
the
zone
in
general
is
made
up
of
low
tawny
waving
roughened
here
and
there
with
brush
and
trees
and
outcropping
masses
of
slate
colored
gray
and
red
with
lichens
the
smaller
masses
of
slate
rising
abruptly
from
the
dry
grassy
sod
in
leaning
slabs
look
like
ancient
tombstones
in
a
deserted
in
early
spring
say
from
february
to
april
the
whole
of
this
belt
is
a
paradise
of
bees
and
flowers
refreshing
rains
then
fall
freely
birds
are
busy
building
their
nests
and
the
sunshine
is
balmy
and
delightful
but
by
the
end
of
may
the
soil
plants
and
sky
seem
to
have
been
baked
in
an
oven
most
of
the
plants
crumble
to
dust
beneath
the
foot
and
the
ground
is
full
of
cracks
while
the
thirsty
traveler
gazes
with
eager
longing
through
the
burning
glare
to
the
snowy
summits
looming
like
hazy
clouds
in
the
distance
the
trees
mostly
and
thirty
to
forty
feet
high
with
thin
foliage
stand
far
apart
and
cast

lizards
glide
about
on

amazing
numbers

tiny
sparks
of
life
seem
to
burn

rabbits
scurry
from

to

among
the
ceanothus
bushes
and
occasionally
a
hare
is
seen
cantering
gracefully
across
the
wider
openings
the
nights
are
calm
and
dewless
during
the
summer
and
a
thousand
voices
proclaim
the
abundance
of
life
notwithstanding
the
desolating
effect
of
dry
sunshine
on
the
plants
and
larger
animals
the
hylas
make
a
delightfully
pure
and
tranquil
music
after

fellows
looking

dead

ones
with
bright
bits
of

about

occur
at
long
intervals
along
the
belt
and
cottages
covered
with
climbing
roses
in
the
midst
of
orange
and
peach
orchards
and
in
fertile
flats
where
water
for
irrigation
may
be
had
but
they
are
mostly
far
apart
and
make
scarce
any
mark
in
general
views
every
winter
the
high
sierra
and
the
middle
forest
region
get
snow
in
glorious
abundance
and
even
the
are
at
times
whitened
then
all
the
range
looks
like
a
vast
beveled
wall
of
purest
marble
the
rough
places
are
then
made
smooth
the
death
and
decay
of
the
year
is
covered
gently
and
kindly
and
the
ground
seems
as
clean
as
the
sky
and
though
silent
in
its
flight
from
the
clouds
and
when
it
is
taking
its
place
on
rock
or
tree
or
grassy
meadow
how
soon
the
gentle
snow
finds
a
voice
slipping
from
the
heights
gathering
in
avalanches
it
booms
and
roars
like
thunder
and
makes
a
glorious
show
as
it
sweeps
down
the
arrayed
in
long
silken
streamers
and
wreathing
swirling
films
of
crystal
dust
the
north
half
of
the
range
is
mostly
covered
with
floods
of
lava
and
dotted
with
volcanoes
and
craters
some
of
them
recent
and
perfect
in
form
others
in
various
stages
of
decay
the
south
half
is
composed
of
granite
nearly
from
base
to
summit
while
a
considerable
number
of
peaks
in
the
middle
of
the
range
are
capped
with
metamorphic
slates
among
which
are
mounts

feet
mount
shasta
a
colossal
volcanic
cone
rises
to
a
height
of
feet
at
the
northern
extremity
and
forms
a
noble
landmark
for
all
the
surrounding
region
within
a
radius
of
a
hundred
miles
residual
masses
of
volcanic
rocks
occur
throughout
most
of
the
granitic
southern
portion
also
and
a
considerable
number
of
old
volcanoes
on
the
flanks
especially
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
range
near
mono
lake
and
southward
but
it
is
only
to
the
northward
that
the
entire

from

to

is
covered
with
lava
from
the
summit
of

only

is
seen
innumerable
peaks
and
spires
but
little
lower
than

innumerable
smaller

distributed
along

on
each

the

nearly
feet
above
miles
of
its
flanks
are
reeking
and
bubbling
with
hot
springs
many
of
them
so
boisterous
and
sulphurous
they
seem
over
ready
to
become
spouting
geysers
like
those
of
the
yellowstone
the
cinder
cone
near
marks
the
most
recent
volcanic
eruption
in
the
sierra
it
is
a
symmetrical
truncated
cone
about
feet
high
covered
with
gray
cinders
and
ashes
and
has
a
regular
unchanged
crater
on
its
summit
in
which
a
few
small
pines
are
growing
these
show
that
the
age
of
the
cone
is
not
less
than
eighty
years
it
stands
between
two
lakes
which
a
short
time
ago
were
one
before
the
cone
was
built
a
flood
of
rough
vesicular
lava
was
poured
into
the
lake
cutting
it
in
two
and
overflowing
its
banks
the
fiery
flood
advanced
into
the
overwhelming
the

charred
ends
of
some
of
which
may
still
be
seen
projecting
from
beneath
the
snout
of
the
where
it
came
to
rest
later
still
there
was
an
eruption
of
ashes
and
loose
obsidian
cinders
probably
from
the
same
vent
which
besides
forming
the
cinder
cone
scattered
a
heavy
shower
over
the
surrounding
woods
for
miles
to
a
depth
of
from
six
inches
to
several
feet
the
history
of
this
last
sierra
eruption
is
also
preserved
in
the
traditions
of
the
pitt
river
indians
they
tell
of
a
fearful
time
of
darkness
when
the
sky
was
black
with
ashes
and
smoke
that
threatened
every
living
thing
with
death
and
that
when

on
the

side
of

is
a
subordinate
cone
about
feet
below
the

which
has
been
active
subsequent
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
main

once
covered
the

as
is
shown
by
its
comparatively
unwasted
crater
and
the
streams
of
unglaciated
lava
radiating
from
it
the
main
summit
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
diameter
bounded
by
small
crumbling
peaks
and
ridges
among
which
we
seek
in
vain
for
the
outlines
of
the
ancient
crater

ruinous
masses
and
the
deep
glacial
grooves

of

that
it
has
been
considerably
lowered

enough
of
its
internal
framework
to
prove
that
comparatively
long
periods
of
quiescence
intervened
between
many
distinct
eruptions
during
which
the

ceased
to

for

and
poured
forth
overwhelming
floods
of

it
is
known
that
more
than
a

have
intervened
between
violent

of

a
telling
series
of
sedimentary
rocks
containing
the
early
history
of
the
sierra
are
now
being
studied
but
leaving
for
the
present
these
first
chapters
we
see
that
only
a
very
short
geological
time
ago
just
before
the
coming
on
of
that
winter
of
winters
called
the
glacial
period
a
vast
deluge
of
molten
rocks
poured
from
many
a
chasm
and
crater
on
the
flanks
and
summit
of
the
range
filling
lake
basins
and
river
channels
and
obliterating
nearly
every
existing
feature
on
the
northern
portion
at
length
these
floods
ceased
to
flow
but
while
the
great
volcanic
cones
built
up
along
the
axis
still
burned
and
smoked
the
whole
sierra
passed
under
the
domain
of
ice
and
snow
then
over
the
bald
featureless
mountains
glaciers
began
to
crawl
covering
them
from
the
summits
to
the
sea
with
a
mantle
of
ice
and
then
with
infinite
deliberation
the
work
went
on
of
sculpturing
the
range
anew
these
mighty
agents
of
erosion
halting
never
through
unnumbered
centuries
crushed
and
ground
the
flinty
lavas
and
granites
beneath
their
crystal
folds
wasting
and
building
until
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
sierra
was
born
again
brought
to
light
nearly
as
we
behold
it
today
with
glaciers
and
pines
at
the
top
of
the
range
and
at
the
foot
of
it
this
change
from
icy
darkness
and
death
to
life
and
beauty
was
slow
as
we
count
time
and
is
still
going
on
north
and
south
over
all
the
world
wherever
glaciers
exist
whether
in
the
form
of
distinct
rivers
as
in
switzerland
norway
the
mountains
of
asia
and
the
pacific
coast
or
in
continuous
mantling
folds
as
in
portions
of
alaska
greenland
nova
zembla
spitzbergen
and
the
lands
about
the
south
pole
but
in
no
country
as
far
as
i
know
may
these
majestic
changes
be
studied
to
better
advantage
than
in
the
plains
and
mountains
of
california
toward
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
when
the
became
less
fertile
and
the
melting
waste
of
sunshine
became
greater
the
lower
folds
of
the
in
california
discharging
fleets
of
icebergs
into
the
sea
began
to
shallow
and
recede
from
the
lowlands
and
then
move
slowly
up
the
flanks
of
the
sierra
in
compliance
with
the
changes
of
climate
the
great
white
mantle
on
the
mountains
broke
up
into
a
series
of
glaciers
more
or
less
distinct
and
with
many
tributaries
and
these
again
were
melted
and
divided
into
still
smaller
glaciers
until
now
only
a
few
of
the
smallest
residual
topmost
branches
of
the
grand
system
exist
on
the
cool
slopes
of

warming
and
sweetening
and
growing
richer
as
the
years
passed
away
over
the
mighty
sierra
so
lately
suggestive
of
death
and
consummate
desolation
only
it
is
hard
without
long
and
loving
study
to
realize
the
magnitude
of
the
work
done
on
these
mountains
during
the
last
glacial
period
by
glaciers
which
are
only
streams
of
closely
compacted
careful
study
of
the
phenomena
presented
goes
to
show
that
the
condition
of
the
range
was
comparatively
simple
one
vast
wave
of
stone
in
which
a
thousand
mountains
domes
cañons
ridges
lay
concealed
and
in
the
development
of
these
nature
chose
for
a
tool
not
the
earthquake
or
lightning
to
rend
and
split
asunder
not
the
stormy
torrent
or
eroding
rain
but
the
tender
noiselessly
falling
through
unnumbered
centuries
the
offspring
of
the
sun
and
sea
laboring
harmoniously
in
united
strength
they
crushed
and
ground
and
wore
away
the
rocks
in
their
march
making
vast
beds
of
soil
and
at
the
same
time
developed
and
fashioned
the
landscapes
into
the
delightful
variety
of
hill
and
dale
and
lordly
mountain
that
mortals
call
beauty
perhaps
more
than
a
mile
in
average
depth
has
the
range
been
thus
degraded
during
the
last
glacial
period
quantity
of
mechanical
work
almost
inconceivably
great
and
our
admiration
must
be
excited
again
and
again
as
we
toil
and
study
and
learn
that
this
vast
job
of
rockwork
so
in
its
influences
was
done
by
agents
so
fragile
and
small
as
are
these
flowers
of
the
mountain
clouds
strong
only
by
force
of
numbers
they
carried
away
entire
mountains
particle
by
particle
block
by
block
and
cast
them
into
the
sea
sculptured
fashioned
modeled
all
the
range
and
developed
its
predestined
beauty
all
these
new
sierra
landscapes
were
evidently
predestined
for
the
physical
structure
of
the
rocks
on
which
the
features
of
the
scenery
depend
was
acquired
while
they
lay
at
least
a
mile
deep
below
the
surface
and
it
was
while
these
features
were
taking
form
in
the
depths
of
the
range
the
particles
of
the
rocks
marching
to
their
appointed
places
in
the
dark
with
reference
to
the
coming
beauty
that
the
particles
of
icy
vapor
in
the
sky
marching
to
the
same
music
assembled
to
bring
them
to
the
light
then
after
their
grand
task
was
done
these
bands
of
these
mighty
glaciers
were
melted
and
removed
as
if
of
no
more
importance
than
dew
destined
to
last
but
an
hour
few
however
of
agents
have
left
monuments
so
noble
and
enduring
as
they
the
great
granite
domes
a
mile
high
the
cañons
as
deep
the
noble
peaks
the
yosemite
valleys
these
and
indeed
nearly
all
other
features
of
the
sierra
scenery
are
glacier
monuments
contemplating
the
works
of
these
flowers

the
sky
one
may
easily
fancy
them
endowed
with
life
messengers
sent
down
to
work
in
the
mountain
mines
on
errands
of
divine
love
silently
flying
through
the
darkened
air
swirling
glinting
to
their
appointed
places
they
seem
to
have
taken
counsel
together
saying
we
are
feeble
let
us
help
one
another
we
are
many
and
together
we
will
be
strong
marching
in
close
deep
ranks
let
us
roll
away
the
stones
from
these
mountain
sepulchers
and
set
the
landscapes
free

us
uncover
these
clustering
domes
here
let
us
carve
a
lake

for
a
river
with
fluted
steps
and

the

us
spread
broad

nothing
that

bear
in

account
for

for

in

of
alaska
and
even
as
far
south
as
vancouver
island
the
coast
rocks
have
been
so
short
a
time
exposed
to
they
are
but
little
wasted
as
yet
in
these
regions
the
extension
of
the
sea
effected
by
its
own
action
in
time
is
scarcely
appreciable
as
compared
with
that
effected
by
traces
of
the
vanished
glaciers
made
during
the
period
of
greater
extension
abound
on
the
sierra
as
far
south
as
latitude
even
the
polished
rock
surfaces
the
most
evanescent
of
glacial
records
are
still
found
in
a
wonderfully
perfect
state
of
preservation
on
the
upper
half
of
the
middle
portion
of
the
range
and
form
the
most
striking
of
all
the
glacial
phenomena
they
occur
in
large
irregular
patches
in
the
summit
and
middle
regions
and
though
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
action
of
the
weather
with
its
corroding
storms
for
thousands
of
years
their
mechanical
excellence
is
such
that
they
still
reflect
the
sunbeams
like
glass
and
attract
the
attention
of
every
observer
the
attention
of
the
mountaineer
is
seldom
arrested
by
moraines
however
regular
and
high
they
may
be
or
by
cañons
however
deep
or
by
rocks
however
noble
in
form
and
sculpture
but
he
stoops
and
rubs
his
hands
admiringly
on
the
shining
surfaces
and
trios
hard
to
account
for
their
mysterious
smoothness
he
has
seen
the
snow
descending
in
avalanches
but
concludes
this
can
not
be
the
work
of
snow
for
he
finds
it
where
no
avalanches
occur
nor
can
water
have
done
it
for
he
sees
this
smoothness
glowing
on
the
sides
and
tops
of
the
highest
domes
only
the
winds
of
all
the
agents
he
knows
seem
capable
of
flowing
in
the
directions
indicated
by
the
scoring
indians
usually
so
little
curious
about
geological
phenomena
have
come
to
me
occasionally
and
asked
me
makeum
the
ground
so
smooth
at
lake
tenaya
even
horses
and
dogs
gaze
wonderingly
at
the
strange
brightness
of
the
ground
and
smell
the
polished
spaces
and
place
their
feet
cautiously
on
them
when
they
come
to
them
for
the
first
time
as
if
afraid
of
sinking
the
most
perfect
of
the
polished
pavements
and
walls
lie
at
an
elevation
of
from
to
feet
above
the
sea
where
the
rock
is
compact
silicious
granite
small
dim
patches
may
be
found
as
low
as
feet
on
the
driest
and
most
enduring
portions
of
sheer
walls
with
a
southern
exposure
and
on
compact
swelling
bosses
partially
protected
from
rain
by
a
covering
of
large
boulders
on
the
north
half
of
the
range
the
striated
and
polished
surfaces
are
less
common
not
only
because
this
part
of
the
chain
is
lower
but
because
the
surface
rocks
are
chiefly
porous
lavas
subject
to
comparatively
rapid
waste
the
ancient
moraines
also
though
well
preserved
on
most
of
the
south
half
of
the
range
are
nearly
obliterated
to
the
northward
but
then
material
is
found
scattered
and
disintegrated
a
similar
blurred
condition
of
the
superficial
records
of
glacial
action
obtains
throughout
most
of
oregon
washington
british
columbia
and
alaska
due
in
great
part
to
the
action
of
excessive
moisture
even
in
southeastern
alaska
where
the
most
extensive
glaciers
on
the
continent
are
the
more
evanescent
of
the
traces
of
their
former
greater
extension
though
comparatively
recent
are
more
obscure
than
those
of
the
ancient
california
glaciers
whore
the
climate
is
drier
and
the
rocks
more
resisting
these
general
views
of
the
glaciers
of
the
pacific
coast
will
enable
my
readers
to
see
something
of
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
california
and
will
throw
light
on
the
residual
glaciers
of
the
high
sierra
prior
to
the
autumn
of
the
glaciers
of
the
sierra
were
unknown
in
october
of
that
year
i
discovered
the
black
mountain
glacier
in
a
shadowy
amphitheater
between
black
and
rod
mountains
two
of
the
peaks
of
the
merced
group
this
group
is
the
highest
portion
of
a
spur
that
straggles
out
from
the
main
axis
of
the
range
in
the
direction
of
yosemite
valley
at
the
time
of
this
interesting
discovery
i
was
exploring
the
amphitheaters
of
the
group
and
tracing
the
courses
of
the
ancient
glaciers
that
once
poured
from
its
ample
fountains
through
the
illilouette
basin
and
the
yosemite
valley
not
expecting
to
find
any
active
glaciers
so
far
south
in
the
land
of
sunshine
beginning
on
the
northwestern
extremity
of
the
group
i
explored
the
chief
tributary
basins
in
succession
their
moraines
roches
moutonnées
and
splendid
glacier
pavements
taking
them
in
regular
succession
without
any
reference
to
the
time
consumed
in
their
study
the
monuments
of
the
tributary
that
poured
its
ice
from
between
red
and
black
mountains
i
found
to
be
the
most
interesting
of
them
all
and
when
i
saw
its
magnificent
moraines
extending
in
majestic
curves
from
the
spacious
amphitheater
between
the
mountains
i
was
exhilarated
with
the
work
that
lay
before
me
it
was
one
of
the
golden
days
of
the
sierra
indian
summer
when
the
rich
sunshine
glorifies
every
landscape
however
rocky
and
cold
and
suggests
anything
rather
than
glaciers
the
path
of
the
vanished
glacier
was
warm
now
and
shone
in
many
places
as
if
washed
with
silver
the
tall
pines
growing
on
the
moraines
stood
transfigured
in
the
glowing
light
the
poplar
groves
on
the
levels
of
the
basin
were
masses
of
and
the
goldenrods
added
gold
to
gold
pushing
on
over
my
rosy
glacial
highway
i
passed
lake
after
lake
set
in
solid
basins
of
granite
and
many
a
thicket
and
meadow
watered
by
a
stream
that
issues
from
the
amphitheater
and
links
the
lakes
together
now
wading
through
plushy
bogs
in
yellow
and
purple
sphagnum
now
passing
over
bare
rock
the
main
lateral
moraines
that
bounded
the
view
on
either
hand
are
from
to
nearly
feet
high
and
about
as
regular
as
artificial
embankments
and
covered
with
a
superb
growth
of
silver
fir
and
pine
but
this
garden
and
forest
luxuriance
was
speedily
left
behind
the
trees
were
dwarfed
as
i
ascended
patches
of
the
alpine
bryanthus
and
cassiope
began
to
appear
and
arctic
willows
pressed
into
flat
carpets
by
the
winter
snow
the
lakelets
which
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
were
so
richly
embroidered
with
flowery
meadows
had
here
at
an
elevation
of
feet
only
small
brown
mats
of
carex
leaving
bare
rocks
around
more
than
half
their
shores
yet
amid
this
alpine
suppression
the
mountain
pine
bravely
tossed
his
branches
on
the
ledges
and
buttresses
of
red
mountain
some
specimens
being
over
feet
high
and
feet
in
circumference
seemingly
as
fresh
and
vigorous
as
the
giants
of
the
lower
zones
evening
came
on
just
as
i
got
fairly
within
the
portal
of
the
main
amphitheater
it
is
about
a
mile
wide
and
a
little
less
than
two
miles
long
the
crumbling
spurs
and
battlements
of
red
mountain
bound
it
on
the
north
the
somber
rudely
sculptured
precipices
of
black
mountain
on
the
south
and
a
hacked
splintery
curving
around
from
mountain
to
mountain
shuts
it
in
on
the
east
i
chose
a
on
the
brink
of
one
of
the
lakes
where
a
thicket
of
hemlock
spruce
sheltered
me
from
the
night
wind
then
after
making
a
of
tea
i
sat
by
my
reflecting
on
the
grandeur
and
significance
of
the
glacial
records
i
had
seen
as
the
night
advanced
the
mighty
rock
walls
of
my
mountain
mansion
seemed
to
come
nearer
while
the
starry
sky
in
glorious
brightness
stretched
across
like
a
ceiling
from
wall
to
wall
and
fitted
closely
down
into
all
the
spiky
irregularities
of
the
summits
then
after
a
long
fireside
rest
and
a
glance
at
my
i
cut
a
few
leafy
branches
for
a
bed
and
fell
into
the
clear
sleep
of
the
tired
mountaineer
early
next
morning
i
set
out
to
trace
the
grand
old
glacier
that
had
done
so
much
for
the
beauty
of
the
yosemite
region
back
to
its
farthest
fountains
enjoying
the
charm
that
every
explorer
feels
in
untrodden
wildernesses
the
voices
of
the
mountains
were
still
asleep
the
wind
scarce
stirred
the
the
sun
was
up
but
it
was
yet
too
cold
for
the
birds
and
the
few
burrowing
animals
that
dwell
here
only
the
stream
cascading
from
pool
to
pool
seemed
to
be
wholly
awake
yet
the
spirit
of
the
opening
day
called
to
action
the
sunbeams
came
streaming
gloriously
through
the
jagged
openings
of
the
glancing
on
the
burnished
pavements
and
lighting
the
silvery
lakes
while
every
rock
burned
white
on
its
edges
like
melting
iron
in
a
furnace
passing
round
the
north
shore
of
my
camp
lake
i
followed
the
central
stream
past
many
cascades
from
lakelet
to
lakelet
the
scenery
became
more
rigidly
arctic
the
dwarf
pines
and
hemlocks
disappeared
and
the
stream
was
bordered
with
icicles
as
the
sun
rose
higher
rocks
were
loosened
on
shattered
portions
of
the
cliffs
and
came
down
in
rattling
avalanches
echoing
wildly
from
crag
to
crag
the
main
lateral
moraines
that
extend
from
the
jaws
of
the
amphitheater
into
the
illilouette
basin
are
continued
in
straggling
masses
along
the
walls
of
the
amphitheater
while
separate
boulders
hundreds
of
tons
in
weight
are
left
stranded
here
and
there
out
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
here
also
i
observed
a
series
of
small
terminal
moraines
ranged
along
the
south
wall
of
the
amphitheater
corresponding
in
size
and
form
with
the
shadows
cast
by
the
highest
portions
the
meaning
of
this
correspondence
between
moraines
and
shadows
was
afterward
made
plain
tracing
the
stream
back
to
the
last
of
its
chain
of
lakelets
i
noticed
a
deposit
of
fine
gray
mud
on
the
bottom
except
where
the
force
of
the
entering
current
had
prevented
its
settling
it
looked
like
the
mud
worn
from
a
grindstone
and
i
at
once
suspected
its
glacial
origin
for
the
stream
that
was
carrying
it
came
gurgling
out
of
the
base
of
a
raw
moraine
that
seemed
in
process
of
formation
not
a
plant
or
was
visible
on
its
rough
unsettled
surface
it
is
from
to
over
feet
high
and
plunges
forward
at
an
angle
of
cautiously
picking
my
way
i
gained
the
top
of
the
moraine
and
was
delighted
to
see
a
small
but
well
characterized
glacier
swooping
down
from
the
gloomy
precipices
of
black
mountain
in
a
finely
graduated
curve
to
the
moraine
on
which
i
stood
the
compact
ice
appeared
on
all
the
lower
portions
of
the
glacier
though
gray
with
dirt
and
stones
embedded
in
it
farther
up
the
ice
disappeared
beneath
coarse
granulated
snow
the
surface
of
the
glacier
was
further
characterized
by
dirt
bands
and
the
outcropping
edges
of
the
blue
veins
showing
the
laminated
structure
of
the
ice
the
uppermost
crevasse
or
where
the
was
attached
to
the
mountain
was
from
to
feet
wide
and
was
bridged
in
a
few
places
by
the
remains
of
snow
avalanches
creeping
along
the
edge
of
the
schrund
holding
on
with
benumbed
fingers
i
discovered
clear
sections
where
the
bedded
structure
was
beautifully
revealed
the
surface
snow
though
sprinkled
with
stones
shot
down
from
the
cliffs
was
in
some
places
almost
pure
gradually
becoming
crystalline
and
changing
to
whitish
porous
ice
of
different
shades
of
color
and
this
again
changing
at
a
depth
of
or
feet
to
blue
ice
some
of
the
bands
of
which
were
nearly
pure
and
blended
with
the
paler
bands
in
the
most
gradual
and
delicate
manner
imaginable
a
series
of
rugged
zigzags
enabled
me
to
make
my
way
down
into
the
weird
of
the
crevasse
its
chambered
hollows
were
hung
with
a
multitude
of
clustered
icicles
amid
which
pale
subdued
light
pulsed
and
shimmered
with
indescribable
loveliness
water
dripped
and
tinkled
overhead
and
from
far
below
came
strange
solemn
murmurings
from
currents
that
were
feeling
their
way
through
veins
and
fissures
in
the
dark
the
chambers
of
a
glacier
are
perfectly
enchanting
notwithstanding
one
feels
out
of
place
in
their
frosty
beauty
i
was
soon
cold
in
my
and
the
leaning
wall
threatened
to
engulf
me
yet
it
was
hard
to
leave
the
delicious
music
of
the
water
and
the
lovely
light
coming
again
to
the
surface
i
noticed
boulders
of
every
size
on
their
journeys
to
the
terminal
of
more
than
a
hundred
years
without
a
single
stop
night
or
day
winter
or
summer
the
sun
gave
birth
to
a
network
of
rills
that
ran
gracefully
down
the
glacier
curling
and
swirling
in
their
shining
channels
and
cutting
clear
sections
through
the
porous
into
the
solid
blue
where
the
structure
of
the
glacier
was
beautifully
illustrated
the
series
of
small
terminal
moraines
which
i
had
observed
in
the
morning
along
the
south
wall
of
the
amphitheater
correspond
in
every
way
with
the
moraine
of
this
glacier
and
their
distribution
with
reference
to
shadows
was
now
understood
when
the
climatic
changes
came
on
that
caused
the
melting
and
retreat
of
the
main
glacier
that
filled
the
amphitheater
a
series
of
residual
glaciers
were
left
in
the
cliff
shadows
under
the
protection
of
which
they
lingered
until
they
formed
the
moraines
we
are
studying
then
as
the
snow
became
still
less
abundant
all
of
them
vanished
in
succession
except
the
one
just
described
and
the
cause
of
its
longer
life
is
sufficiently
apparent
in
the
greater
area
of
it
drains
and
its
more
perfect
protection
from
wasting
sunshine
how
much
longer
this
little
glacier
will
last
depends
of
course
on
the
amount
of
snow
it
receives
from
year
to
year
as
compared
with
melting
waste
after
this
discovery
i
made
excursions
over
all
the
high
sierra
pushing
my
explorations
summer
after
summer
and
discovered
that
what
at
first
sight
in
the
distance
looked
like
extensive
wore
in
great
part
glaciers
busily
at
work
completing
the
sculpture
of
the
so
grandly
blocked
out
by
their
giant
predecessors
on
august
i
set
a
series
of
stakes
in
the
maclure
glacier
near
mount
lyell
and
found
its
rate
of
motion
to
be
little
more
than
an
inch
a
day
in
the
middle
showing
a
great
contrast
to
the
muir
glacier
in
alaska
which
near
the
front
flows
at
a
rate
of
from
five
to
ten
feet
in
hours
mount
shasta
has
three
glaciers
but
mount
whitney
although
it
is
the
highest
mountain
in
the
range
does
not
now
cherish
a
single
glacier
small
patches
of
lasting
snow
and
ice
occur
on
its
northern
slopes
but
they
are
shallow
and
present
no
well
marked
evidence
of
glacial
motion
its
sides
however
are
scored
and
polished
in
many
places
by
the
action
of
its
ancient
glaciers
that
flowed
east
and
west
as
tributaries
of
the
great
glaciers
that
once
filled
the
valleys
of
the
kern
and
rivers
chapter
iii
the
snow
the
first
snow
that
whitens
the
sierra
usually
falls
about
the
end
of
october
or
early
in
november
to
a
depth
of
a
few
inches
after
months
of
the
most
charming
indian
summer
weather
imaginable
but
in
a
few
days
this
light
covering
mostly
melts
from
the
slopes
exposed
to
the
sun
and
causes
but
little
apprehension
on
the
part
of
mountaineers
who
may
be
lingering
among
the
high
peaks
at
this
time
the
first
general
winter
storm
that
yields
snow
that
is
to
form
a
lasting
portion
of
the
supply
seldom
breaks
on
the
mountains
before
the
end
of
november
then
warned
by
the
sky
cautions
mountaineers
together
with
the
wild
sheep
deer
and
most
of
the
birds
and
bears
make
haste
to
the
lowlands
or
and
burrowing
marmots
mountain
beavers
and
such
people
go
into
winter
quarters
some
of
them
not
again
to
see
the
light
of
day
until
the
general
awakening
and
resurrection
of
the
spring
in
june
or
july
the
first
heavy
fall
is
usually
from
about
two
to
four
feet
in
depth
then
with
intervals
of
splendid
sunshine
storm
succeeds
storm
heaping
snow
on
snow
until
thirty
to
fifty
feet
has
fallen
but
on
account
of
its
settling
and
compacting
and
the
almost
constant
waste
from
melting
and
evaporation
the
average
depth
actually
found
at
any
time
seldom
exceeds
ten
feet
in
the
forest
region
or
fifteen
feet
along
the
slopes
of
the
summit
peaks
even
during
the
coldest
weather
evaporation
never
wholly
ceases
and
the
sunshine
that
abounds
between
the
storms
is
sufficiently
powerful
to
melt
the
surface
more
or
less
through
all
the
winter
months
waste
from
melting
also
goes
on
to
some
extent
on
the
bottom
from
heat
stored
up
in
the
rocks
and
given
off
slowly
to
the
snow
in
contact
with
them
as
is
shown
by
the
rising
of
the
streams
on
all
the
higher
regions
after
the
first
snowfall
and
their
steady
sustained
flow
all
winter
the
greater
portion
of
the
snow
deposited
around
the
lofty
summits
of
the
range
falls
in
small
crisp
flakes
and
broken
crystals
or
when
accompanied
by
strong
winds
and
low
temperature
the
crystals
instead
of
being
locked
together
in
their
fall
to
form
tufted
flakes
are
beaten
and
broken
into
meal
and
fine
dust
but
down
in
the
forest
region
the
greater
portion
comes
gently
to
the
ground
light
and
feathery
some
of
the
flakes
in
mild
weather
being
nearly
an
inch
in
diameter
and
it
is
evenly
distributed
and
kept
from
drifting
to
any
great
extent
by
the
shelter
afforded
by
the
large
trees
every
tree
during
the
progress
of
gentle
storms
is
loaded
with
fairy
bloom
at
the
coldest
and
darkest
time
of
year
bending
the
branches
and
hushing
every
singing
needle
but
as
soon
as
the
storm
is
over
and
the
sun
shines
the
snow
at
once
begins
to
shift
and
settle
and
fall
from
the
branches
in
miniature
avalanches
and
the
white
forest
soon
becomes
green
again
the
snow
on
the
ground
also
settles
and
thaws
every
bright
day
and
freezes
at
night
until
it
becomes
coarsely
granulated
and
loses
every
trace
of
its
rayed
crystalline
structure
and
then
a
man
may
walk
firmly
over
its
frozen
surface
as
if
on
ice
the
forest
region
up
to
an
elevation
of
feet
is
usually
in
great
part
free
from
snow
in
june
but
at
this
time
the
higher
regions
are
still
and
are
not
touched
by
spring
weather
to
any
considerable
extent
before
the
middle
or
end
of
july
one
of
the
most
striking
effects
of
the
snow
on
the
mountains
is
the
burial
of
the
rivers
and
small
lakes
as
the
snow
in
the
river
a
moment
white
then
lost
forever
sang
burns
in
illustrating
the
fleeting
character
of
human
pleasure
the
first
snowflakes
that
fall
into
the
sierra
rivers
vanish
thus
suddenly
but
in
great
storms
when
the
temperature
is
low
the
abundance
of
the
snow
at
length
chills
the
water
nearly
to
the
and
then
of
course
it
ceases
to
melt
and
consume
the
snow
so
suddenly
the
falling
flakes
and
crystals
form
masses
of
blue
sludge
which
are
swept
forward
with
the
current
and
carried
down
to
warmer
climates
many
miles
distant
while
some
are
lodged
against
logs
and
rocks
and
projecting
points
of
the
banks
and
last
for
days
piled
high
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
show
white
again
instead
of
being
at
once
forever
while
the
rivers
themselves
are
at
length
lost
for
months
during
the
snowy
period
the
snow
is
first
built
out
from
the
banks
in
bossy
drifts
compacting
and
cementing
until
the
streams
are
spanned
they
then
flow
in
the
dark
beneath
a
continuous
covering
across
the
snowy
zone
which
is
about
thirty
miles
wide
all
the
sierra
rivers
and
their
tributaries
in
these
high
regions
are
thus
lost
every
winter
as
if
another
glacial
period
had
come
on
not
a
drop
of
running
water
is
to
be
seen
excepting
at
a
few
points
where
large
falls
occur
though
the
rush
and
rumble
of
the
heavier
currents
may
still
be
heard
toward
spring
when
the
weather
is
warm
during
the
day
and
frosty
at
night
repeated
thawing
and
freezing
and
new
layers
of
snow
render
the
dense
and
firm
so
that
one
may
safely
walk
across
the
streams
or
even
lead
a
horse
across
them
without
danger
of
falling
through
in
june
the
thinnest
parts
of
the
winter
ceiling
and
those
most
exposed
to
sunshine
begin
to
give
way
forming
dark
sinks
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
rushing
water
may
be
seen
at
the
end
of
june
only
here
and
there
may
the
mountaineer
find
a
secure
the
most
lasting
of
the
winter
bridges
thawing
from
below
as
well
as
from
above
because
of
warm
currents
of
air
passing
through
the
tunnels
are
strikingly
arched
and
sculptured
and
by
the
occasional
freezing
of
the
oozing
dripping
water
of
the
ceiling
they
become
brightly
and
picturesquely
icy
in
some
of
the
reaches
where
there
is
a
free
margin
we
may
walk
through
them
small
skylights
appearing
here
and
there
these
tunnels
are
not
very
dark
the
roaring
river
fills
all
the
arching
way
with
impressively
loud
reverberating
music
which
is
sweetened
at
times
by
the
ouzel
a
bird
that
is
not
afraid
to
go
wherever
a
stream
may
go
and
to
sing
wherever
a
stream
sings
all
the
small
alpine
pools
and
lakelets
are
in
like
manner
obliterated
from
the
winter
landscapes
either
by
being
first
frozen
and
then
covered
by
snow
or
by
being
filled
in
by
avalanches
the
first
avalanche
of
the
season
shot
into
a
lake
basin
may
perhaps
find
the
surface
frozen
then
there
is
a
grand
crashing
of
breaking
ice
and
dashing
of
waves
mingled
with
the
low
deep
booming
of
the
avalanche
detached
masses
of
the
invading
snow
mixed
with
fragments
of
ice
drift
about
in
sludgy
heaps
while
the
main
body
of
it
forms
a
talus
with
its
base
wholly
or
in
part
resting
on
the
bottom
of
the
basin
as
controlled
by
its
depth
and
the
size
of
the
avalanche
the
next
avalanche
of
course
encroaches
still
farther
and
so
on
with
each
in
succession
until
the
entire
basin
may
be
filled
and
its
water
sponged
up
or
displaced
this
huge
mass
of
sludge
more
or
less
mixed
with
sand
stones
and
perhaps
timber
is
frozen
to
a
considerable
depth
and
much
is
required
to
thaw
it
some
of
these
unfortunate
lakelets
are
not
clear
of
ice
and
snow
until
near
the
end
of
summer
others
are
never
quite
free
opening
only
on
the
side
opposite
the
entrance
of
the
avalanches
some
show
only
a
narrow
crescent
of
water
lying
between
the
shore
and
sheer
bluffs
of
icy
compacted
snow
masses
of
which
breaking
off
float
in
front
like
icebergs
in
a
miniature
arctic
ocean
while
the
avalanche
heaps
leaning
back
against
the
mountains
look
like
small
glaciers
the
frontal
cliffs
are
in
some
instances
quite
picturesque
and
with
the
waters
in
front
of
them
lighted
with
sunshine
are
exceedingly
beautiful
it
often
happens
that
while
one
side
of
a
lake
basin
is
hopelessly
and
frozen
the
other
enjoying
sunshine
is
adorned
with
beautiful
some
of
the
smaller
lakes
are
extinguished
in
an
instant
by
a
heavy
avalanche
either
of
rocks
or
snow
the
rolling
sliding
ponderous
mass
entering
on
one
side
sweeps
across
the
bottom
and
up
the
opposite
side
displacing
the
water
and
even
scraping
the
basin
clean
and
shoving
the
accumulated
rocks
and
sediments
up
the
farther
bank
and
taking
full
possession
the
dislodged
water
is
in
part
absorbed
but
most
of
it
is
sent
around
the
front
of
the
avalanche
and
down
the
channel
of
the
outlet
roaring
and
hurrying
as
if
frightened
and
glad
to
escape
the
most
magnificent
storm
phenomenon
i
ever
saw
surpassing
in
showy
grandeur
the
most
imposing
effects
of
clouds
floods
or
avalanches
was
the
peaks
of
the
high
sierra
back
of
yosemite
valley
decorated
with
many
of
the
starry
out
of
which
these
banners
are
made
fall
before
they
are
ripe
while
most
of
those
that
do
attain
perfect
development
as
crystals
glint
and
chafe
against
one
another
in
their
fall
through
the
frosty
air
and
are
broken
into
fragments
this
dry
fragmentary
snow
is
still
further
prepared
for
the
formation
of
banners
by
the
action
of
the
wind
for
instead
of
finding
rest
at
once
like
the
snow
which
falls
into
the
tranquil
depths
of
the
forests
it
is
rolled
over
and
over
beaten
against
and
swirled
in
pits
and
hollows
like
boulders
pebbles
and
sand
in
the
of
a
river
until
finally
the
delicate
angles
of
the
crystals
are
worn
off
and
the
whole
mass
is
reduced
to
dust
and
whenever
find
this
prepared
in
a
loose
condition
on
exposed
slopes
where
there
is
a
free
upward
sweep
to
leeward
it
is
tossed
back
into
the
sky
and
borne
onward
from
peak
to
peak
in
the
form
of
banners
or
cloudy
drifts
according
to
the
velocity
of
the
wind
and
the
conformation
of
the
slopes
up
or
around
which
it
is
driven
while
thus
flying
through
the
air
a
small
portion
makes
good
its
escape
and
remains
in
the
sky
as
vapor
but
far
the
greater
part
after
being
driven
into
the
sky
again
and
again
is
at
length
locked
fast
in
bossy
drifts
or
in
the
wombs
of
glaciers
some
of
it
to
remain
silent
and
rigid
for
centuries
before
it
is
finally
melted
and
sent
singing
down
the
mountainsides
to
the
sea
yet
notwithstanding
the
abundance
of
winter
in
the
mountains
and
the
frequency
of
high
winds
and
the
length
of
time
the
dust
remains
loose
and
exposed
to
their
action
the
occurrence
of
banners
is
for
causes
we
shall
hereafter
note
comparatively
rare
i
have
seen
only
one
display
of
this
kind
that
seemed
in
every
way
perfect
this
was
in
the
winter
of
when
the
summits
were
swept
by
a
wild
i
happened
at
the
time
to
be
wintering
in
yosemite
valley
that
sublime
sierra
temple
where
every
day
one
may
see
the
grandest
sights
yet
even
here
the
wild
of
the
north
wind
seemed
surpassingly
glorious
i
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
rocking
of
my
cabin
and
the
beating
of
on
the
roof
detached
torrents
and
avalanches
from
the
main
overhead
were
rushing
wildly
down
the
narrow
side
cañons
and
over
the
precipitous
walls
with
loud
resounding
roar
rousing
the
pines
to
enthusiastic
action
and
making
the
whole
valley
vibrate
as
though
it
were
an
instrument
being
played
but
afar
on
the
lofty
exposed
peaks
of
the
range
standing
so
high
in
the
sky
the
storm
was
expressing
itself
in
still
grander
characters
which
i
was
soon
to
see
in
all
their
glory
i
had
long
been
anxious
to
study
some
points
in
the
structure
of
the
that
is
formed
every
winter
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
yosemite
fall
but
the
blinding
spray
by
which
it
is
invested
had
hitherto
prevented
me
from
making
a
sufficiently
near
approach
this
morning
the
entire
body
of
the
fall
was
torn
into
gauzy
shreds
and
blown
horizontally
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
leaving
the
cone
dry
and
while
making
my
way
to
the
top
of
an
overlooking
ledge
to
seize
so
favorable
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
interior
of
the
cone
the
peaks
of
the
merced
group
came
in
sight
over
the
shoulder
of
the
south
dome
each
waving
a
resplendent
banner
against
the
blue
sky
as
regular
in
form
and
as
firm
in
texture
as
if
woven
of
fine
silk
so
rare
and
splendid
a
phenomenon
of
course
overbore
all
other
considerations
and
i
at
once
let
the
go
and
began
to
force
my
way
out
of
the
valley
to
some
dome
or
ridge
sufficiently
lofty
to
command
a
general
view
of
the
main
summits
feeling
assured
that
i
should
find
them
bannered
still
more
gloriously
nor
was
i
in
the
least
disappointed
indian
cañon
through
which
i
climbed
was
choked
with
snow
that
had
been
shot
down
in
avalanches
from
the
high
cliffs
on
either
side
rendering
the
ascent
difficult
but
inspired
by
the
roaring
storm
the
tedious
wallowing
brought
no
fatigue
and
in
four
hours
i
gained
the
top
of
a
ridge
above
the
valley
feet
high
and
there
in
bold
relief
like
a
clear
painting
appeared
a
most
imposing
scene
innumerable
peaks
black
and
sharp
rose
grandly
into
the
dark
blue
sky
their
bases
set
in
solid
white
their
sides
streaked
and
splashed
with
snow
like
ocean
rocks
with
foam
and
from
every
summit
all
free
and
unconfused
was
streaming
a
beautiful
silky
silvery
banner
from
half
a
mile
to
a
mile
in
length
slender
at
the
point
of
attachment
then
widening
gradually
as
it
extended
from
the
peak
until
it
was
about
or
feet
in
breadth
as
near
as
i
could
estimate
the
cluster
of
peaks
called
the
of
the
sierra
at
the
head
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
rivers
dana
gibbs
conness
lyell
maclure
ritter
with
their
nameless
compeers
had
its
own
refulgent
banner
waving
with
a
clearly
visible
motion
in
the
sunglow
and
there
was
not
a
single
cloud
in
the
sky
to
mar
their
simple
grandeur
fancy
yourself
standing
on
this
yosemite
ridge
looking
eastward
you
notice
a
strange
garish
glitter
in
the
air
the
gale
drives
wildly
overhead
with
a
fierce
tempestuous
roar
but
its
violence
is
not
felt
for
you
are
looking
through
a
sheltered
opening
in
the
woods
as
through
a
window
there
in
the
immediate
foreground
of
your
picture
rises
a
majestic
forest
of
silver
fir
blooming
in
eternal
freshness
the
foliage
and
the
snow
beneath
the
trees
strewn
with
their
beautiful
plumes
plucked
off
by
the
wind
beyond
and
extending
over
all
the
middle
ground
are
somber
swaths
of
pine
interrupted
by
huge
swelling
ridges
and
domes
and
just
beyond
the
dark
forest
you
see
the
monarchs
of
the
high
sierra
waving
their
magnificent
banners
they
are
twenty
miles
away
but
you
would
not
wish
them
nearer
for
every
feature
is
distinct
and
the
whole
glorious
show
is
seen
in
its
right
proportions
after
this
general
view
mark
how
sharply
the
dark
snowless
ribs
and
buttresses
and
summits
of
the
peaks
are
defined
excepting
the
portions
veiled
by
the
banners
and
how
delicately
their
sides
are
streaked
with
snow
where
it
has
come
to
rest
in
narrow
flutings
and
gorges
mark
too
how
grandly
the
banners
wave
as
the
wind
is
deflected
against
their
sides
and
how
trimly
each
is
attached
to
the
very
summit
of
its
peak
like
a
streamer
at
a
masthead
how
smooth
and
silky
they
are
in
texture
and
how
finely
their
fading
fringes
are
penciled
on
the
azure
sky
see
how
dense
and
opaque
they
are
at
the
point
of
attachment
and
how
filmy
and
translucent
toward
the
end
so
that
the
peaks
back
of
them
are
seen
dimly
as
though
you
were
looking
through
ground
glass
yet
again
observe
how
some
of
the
longest
belonging
to
the
loftiest
summits
stream
perfectly
free
all
the
way
across
intervening
notches
and
passes
from
peak
to
peak
while
others
overlap
and
partly
hide
each
other
and
consider
how
keenly
every
particle
of
this
wondrous
cloth
of
snow
is
flashing
out
jets
of
light
these
are
the
main
features
of
the
beautiful
and
terrible
picture
as
seen
from
the
forest
window
and
it
would
still
be
surpassingly
glorious
were
the
and
obliterated
altogether
leaving
only
the
black
peaks
the
white
banners
and
the
blue

illustration
kolana
rock
valley
glancing
now
in
a
general
way
at
the
formation
of
we
find
that
the
main
causes
of
the
wondrous
beauty
and
perfection
of
those
we
have
been
contemplating
were
the
favorable
direction
and
great
force
of
the
wind
the
abundance
of
and
the
peculiar
conformation
of
the
slopes
of
the
peaks
it
is
essential
not
only
that
the
wind
should
move
with
great
velocity
and
steadiness
to
supply
a
sufficiently
copious
and
continuous
stream
of
but
that
it
should
come
from
the
north
no
perfect
banner
is
ever
hung
on
the
sierra
peaks
by
a
south
wind
had
the
gale
that
day
blown
from
the
south
leaving
other
conditions
unchanged
only
a
dull
confused
drift
would
have
been
produced
for
the
snow
instead
of
being
spouted
up
over
the
tops
of
the
peaks
in
concentrated
currents
to
be
drawn
out
as
streamers
would
have
been
shed
off
around
the
sides
and
piled
down
into
the
glacier
wombs
the
cause
of
the
concentrated
action
of
the
north
wind
is
found
in
the
peculiar
form
of
the
north
sides
of
the
peaks
where
the
amphitheaters
of
the
residual
glaciers
are
in
general
the
south
sides
are
convex
and
irregular
while
the
north
sides
are
concave
both
in
their
vertical
and
horizontal
sections
the
wind
in
ascending
these
curves
converges
toward
the
summits
carrying
the
snow
in
concentrating
currents
with
it
shooting
it
almost
straight
up
into
the
air
above
the
peaks
from
which
it
is
then
carried
away
in
a
horizontal
direction
this
difference
in
form
between
the
north
and
south
sides
of
the
peaks
was
almost
wholly
produced
by
the
difference
in
the
kind
and
quantity
of
the
glaciation
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
the
north
sides
having
been
hollowed
by
residual
of
a
form
that
never
existed
on
the
sides
it
appears
therefore
that
shadows
in
great
part
determine
not
only
the
forms
of
lofty
icy
mountains
but
also
those
of
the
that
the
wild
winds
hang
on
them
chapter
iv
a
near
view
of
the
high
sierra
early
one
bright
morning
in
the
middle
of
indian
summer
while
the
glacier
meadows
were
still
crisp
with
frost
crystals
i
set
out
from
the
foot
of
mount
lyell
on
my
way
down
to
yosemite
valley
to
replenish
my
exhausted
store
of
bread
and
tea
i
had
spent
the
past
summer
as
many
preceding
ones
exploring
the
glaciers
that
lie
on
the
head
waters
of
the
san
joaquin
tuolumne
merced
and
rivers
measuring
and
studying
their
movements
trends
crevasses
moraines
and
the
part
they
had
played
during
the
period
of
their
greater
extension
in
the
creation
and
development
of
the
landscapes
of
this
alpine
wonderland
the
time
for
this
kind
of
work
was
nearly
over
for
the
year
and
i
began
to
look
forward
with
delight
to
the
approaching
winter
with
its
wondrous
storms
when
i
would
be
warmly
in
my
yosemite
cabin
with
plenty
of
bread
and
books
but
a
tinge
of
regret
came
on
when
i
considered
that
possibly
i
might
not
see
this
favorite
region
again
until
the
next
summer
excepting
distant
views
from
the
heights
about
the
yosemite
walls
to
artists
few
portions
of
the
high
sierra
are
strictly
speaking
picturesque
the
whole
massive
uplift
of
the
range
is
one
great
picture
not
clearly
divisible
into
smaller
ones
differing
much
in
this
respect
from
the
older
and
what
may
be
called
riper
mountains
of
the
coast
range
all
the
landscapes
of
the
sierra
as
we
have
seen
were
born
again
remodeled
from
base
to
summit
by
the
developing
of
the
last
glacial
winter
but
all
those
new
landscapes
were
not
brought
forth
simultaneously
some
of
the
highest
where
the
ice
lingered
longest
are
tens
of
centuries
younger
than
those
of
the
warmer
regions
below
them
in
general
the
younger
the
i
mean
with
reference
to
the
time
of
their
emergence
from
the
ice
of
the
glacial
period
less
separable
are
they
into
artistic
bits
capable
of
being
made
into
warm
sympathetic
lovable
pictures
with
appreciable
humanity
in
them
here
however
on
the
head
waters
of
the
tuolumne
is
a
group
of
wild
peaks
on
which
the
geologist
may
say
that
the
sun
has
but
just
begun
to
shine
which
is
yet
in
a
high
degree
picturesque
and
in
its
main
features
so
regular
and
evenly
balanced
as
almost
to
appear
somber
cluster
of
peaks
with
gray
granite
bosses
braided
around
its
base
the
whole
surging
free
into
the
sky
from
the
head
of
a
magnificent
valley
whose
lofty
walls
are
beveled
away
on
both
sides
so
as
to
embrace
it
all
without
admitting
anything
not
strictly
belonging
to
it
the
foreground
was
now
aflame
with
autumn
colors
brown
and
purple
and
gold
ripe
in
the
mellow
sunshine
contrasting
brightly
with
the
deep
cobalt
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
black
and
gray
and
pure
spiritual
white
of
the
rocks
and
glaciers
down
through
the
midst
the
young
tuolumne
was
seen
pouring
from
its
crystal
fountains
now
resting
in
glassy
pools
as
if
changing
back
again
into
ice
now
leaping
in
white
cascades
as
if
turning
to
snow
gliding
right
and
left
between
granite
bosses
then
sweeping
on
through
the
smooth
meadowy
levels
of
the
valley
swaying
pensively
from
side
to
side
with
calm
stately
gestures
past
dipping
willows
and
sedges
and
around
groves
of
arrowy
pine
and
throughout
its
whole
eventful
course
whether
flowing
fast
or
slow
singing
loud
or
low
ever
filling
the
landscape
with
spiritual
animation
and
manifesting
the
grandeur
of
its
sources
in
every
movement
and
tone
pursuing
my
lonely
way
down
the
valley
i
turned
again
and
again
to
gaze
on
the
glorious
picture
throwing
up
my
arms
to
inclose
it
as
in
a
frame
after
long
ages
of
growth
in
the
darkness
beneath
the
glaciers
through
sunshine
and
storms
it
seemed
now
to
be
ready
and
waiting
for
the
elected
artist
like
yellow
wheat
for
the
reaper
and
i
could
not
help
wishing
that
i
might
carry
colors
and
brushes
with
me
on
my
travels
and
learn
to
paint
in
the
mean
time
i
had
to
be
content
with
photographs
on
my
mind
and
sketches
in
my
at
length
after
i
had
rounded
a
precipitous
headland
that
puts
out
from
the
west
wall
of
the
valley
every
peak
vanished
from
sight
and
i
pushed
rapidly
along
the
frozen
meadows
over
the
divide
between
the
waters
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
and
down
through
the
forests
that
clothe
the
slopes
of
rest
arriving
in
yosemite
in
due
with
me
is
time
and
strange
to
say
among
the
first
people
i
met
here
were
two
artists
who
with
letters
of
introduction
were
awaiting
my
return
they
inquired
whether
in
the
course
of
my
explorations
in
the
adjacent
mountains
i
had
ever
come
upon
a
landscape
suitable
for
a
large
painting
whereupon
i
began
a
description
of
the
one
that
had
so
lately
excited
my
admiration
then
as
i
went
on
further
and
further
into
details
their
faces
began
to
glow
and
i
offered
to
guide
them
to
it
while
they
declared
that
they
would
gladly
follow
far
or
near
whithersoever
i
could
spare
the
time
to
lead
them
since
storms
might
come
breaking
down
through
the
fine
weather
at
any
time
burying
the
colors
in
snow
and
cutting
off
the
retreat
i
advised
getting
ready
at
once
i
led
them
out
of
the
valley
by
the
vernal
and
nevada
falls
thence
over
the
main
dividing
ridge
to
the
big
tuolumne
meadows
by
the
old
mono
trail
and
thence
along
the
upper
tuolumne
river
to
its
head
this
was
my
first
excursion
into
the
high
sierra
and
as
i
was
almost
always
alone
in
my
mountaineering
the
way
that
the
fresh
beauty
was
reflected
in
their
faces
made
for
me
a
novel
and
interesting
study
they
naturally
were
affected
most
of
all
by
the
intense
azure
of
the
sky
the
purplish
grays
of
the
granite
the
red
and
browns
of
dry
meadows
and
the
translucent
purple
and
crimson
of
huckleberry
bogs
the
flaming
yellow
of
aspen
groves
the
silvery
flashing
of
the
streams
and
the
bright
green
and
blue
of
the
glacier
lakes
but
the
general
expression
of
the
and
sadly
disappointing
and
as
they
threaded
the
forest
from
ridge
to
ridge
eagerly
scanning
the
landscapes
as
they
were
unfolded
they
said
this
is
huge
and
sublime
but
we
see
nothing
as
yet
at
all
available
for
effective
pictures
art
is
long
and
art
is
limited
you
know
and
here
are
foregrounds
backgrounds
all
alike
bare
woods
groves
diminutive
flecks
of
meadow
and
strips
of
glittering
mind
i
replied
bide
a
wee
and
i
will
show
you
something
you
will
at
length
toward
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
sierra
crown
began
to
come
into
view
and
when
we
had
fairly
rounded
the
projecting
headland
before
mentioned
the
whole
picture
stood
revealed
in
the
flush
of
the
alpenglow
their
enthusiasm
was
excited
beyond
bounds
and
the
more
impulsive
of
the
two
a
young
scotchman
dashed
ahead
shouting
and
gesticulating
and
tossing
his
arms
in
the
air
like
a
madman
here
at
last
was
a
typical
alpine
landscape
after
feasting
awhile
on
the
view
i
proceeded
to
make
camp
in
a
sheltered
grove
a
little
way
back
from
the
meadow
where
could
be
obtained
for
beds
and
where
there
was
plenty
of
dry
wood
for
fires
while
the
artists
ran
here
and
there
along
the
and
up
the
sides
of
the
cañon
choosing
foregrounds
for
sketches
after
dark
when
our
tea
was
made
and
a
rousing
fire
had
been
built
we
began
to
make
our
plans
they
decided
to
remain
several
days
at
the
least
while
i
concluded
to
make
an
excursion
in
the
mean
time
to
the
untouched
summit
of
ritter
it
was
now
about
the
middle
of
october
the
springtime
of
the
first
had
already
bloomed
and
the
peaks
were
strewn
with
fresh
crystals
without
however
affecting
the
climbing
to
any
dangerous
extent
and
as
the
weather
was
still
profoundly
calm
and
the
distance
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
only
a
little
more
than
a
day
i
felt
that
i
was
running
no
great
risk
of
being
mount
ritter
is
king
of
the
mountains
of
the
middle
portion
of
the
high
sierra
as
shasta
of
the
north
and
whitney
of
the
south
sections
moreover
as
far
as
i
know
it
had
never
been
climbed
i
had
explored
the
adjacent
wilderness
summer
after
summer
but
my
studies
thus
far
had
never
drawn
me
to
the
top
of
it
its
height
above
is
about
feet
and
it
is
fenced
round
by
steeply
inclined
glaciers
and
cañons
of
tremendous
depth
and
ruggedness
which
render
it
almost
inaccessible
but
difficulties
of
this
kind
only
exhilarate
the
mountaineer
next
morning
the
artists
went
heartily
to
their
work
and
i
to
mine
former
experiences
had
given
good
reason
to
know
that
passionate
storms
invisible
as
yet
might
be
brooding
in
the
calm
therefore
before
bidding
farewell
i
warned
the
artists
not
to
be
alarmed
should
i
fail
to
appear
before
a
week
or
ten
days
and
advised
them
in
case
a
should
set
in
to
keep
up
big
fires
and
shelter
themselves
as
best
they
could
and
on
no
account
to
become
frightened
and
attempt
to
seek
their
way
back
to
yosemite
alone
through
the
drifts
my
general
plan
was
simply
this
to
scale
the
cañon
wall
cross
over
to
the
eastern
flank
of
the
range
and
then
make
my
way
southward
to
the
northern
spurs
of
mount
ritter
in
compliance
with
the
intervening
topography
for
to
push
on
directly
southward
from
camp
through
the
innumerable
peaks
and
pinnacles
that
adorn
this
portion
of
the
axis
of
the
range
however
interesting
would
take
too
much
time
besides
being
extremely
difficult
and
dangerous
at
this
time
of
year
all
my
first
day
was
pure
pleasure
simply
mountaineering
indulgence
crossing
the
dry
pathways
of
the
ancient
glaciers
tracing
happy
streams
and
learning
the
habits
of
the
birds
and
marmots
in
the
groves
and
rocks
before
i
had
gone
a
mile
from
camp
i
came
to
the
foot
of
a
white
cascade
that
beats
its
way
down
a
rugged
gorge
in
the
cañon
wall
from
a
height
of
about
nine
hundred
feet
and
pours
its
throbbing
waters
into
the
tuolumne
i
was
acquainted
with
its
fountains
which
fortunately
lay
in
my
course
what
a
fine
traveling
companion
it
proved
to
be
what
songs
it
sang
and
how
passionately
it
told
the
own
joy
gladly
i
climbed
along
its
dashing
border
absorbing
its
divine
music
and
bathing
from
time
to
time
in
waftings
of
irised
spray
climbing
higher
higher
now
beauty
came
streaming
on
the
sight
painted
meadows
gardens
peaks
of
rare
architecture
lakes
here
and
there
shining
like
silver
and
glimpses
of
the
forested
middle
region
and
the
yellow
lowlands
far
in
the
west
beyond
the
range
i
saw
the
mono
desert
lying
dreamily
silent
in
thick
purple
desert
of
heavy
beheld
from
a
desert
of
granite
here
the
waters
divide
shouting
in
glorious
enthusiasm
and
falling
eastward
to
vanish
in
the
volcanic
sands
and
dry
sky
of
the
great
basin
or
westward
to
the
great
valley
of
california
and
thence
through
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
the
golden
gate
to
the
sea
passing
a
little
way
down
over
the
summit
until
i
had
reached
an
elevation
of
about
feet
i
pushed
on
southward
toward
a
group
of
savage
peaks
that
stand
guard
about
ritter
on
the
north
and
west
groping
my
way
and
dealing
instinctively
with
every
obstacle
as
it
presented
itself
here
a
huge
gorge
would
be
found
cutting
across
my
path
along
the
dizzy
edge
of
which
i
scrambled
until
some
less
precipitous
point
was
discovered
where
i
might
safely
venture
to
the
bottom
and
then
selecting
some
feasible
portion
of
the
opposite
wall
reascend
with
the
same
slow
caution
massive
spurs
alternate
with
the
gorges
plunging
abruptly
from
the
shoulders
of
the
snowy
peaks
and
planting
their
feet
in
the
warm
desert
these
were
everywhere
marked
and
adorned
with
characteristic
sculptures
of
the
ancient
glaciers
that
swept
over
this
entire
region
like
one
vast
and
the
polished
surfaces
produced
by
the
ponderous
flood
are
still
so
perfectly
preserved
that
in
many
places
the
sunlight
reflected
from
them
is
about
as
trying
to
the
eyes
as
sheets
of
snow
grind
slowly
but
they
have
been
kept
in
motion
long
enough
in
california
to
grind
sufficient
soil
for
a
glorious
abundance
of
life
though
most
of
the
grist
has
been
carried
to
the
lowlands
leaving
these
high
regions
comparatively
lean
and
bare
while
the
agents
of
erosion
have
not
yet
furnished
sufficient
available
food
over
the
general
surface
for
more
than
a
few
tufts
of
the
hardiest
plants
chiefly
carices
and
eriogonae
and
it
is
interesting
to
learn
in
this
connection
that
the
sparseness
and
repressed
character
of
the
vegetation
at
this
height
is
caused
more
by
want
of
soil
than
by
harshness
of
climate
for
here
and
there
in
sheltered
hollows
countersunk
beneath
the
general
surface
into
which
a
few
rods
of
moraine
chips
have
been
dumped
we
find
groves
of
spruce
and
pine
thirty
to
forty
feet
high
trimmed
around
the
edges
with
willow
and
huckleberry
bushes
and
oftentimes
still
further
by
an
outer
ring
of
tall
grasses
bright
with
lupines
larkspurs
and
showy
columbines
suggesting
a
climate
by
no
means
repressingly
severe
all
the
streams
too
and
the
pools
at
this
elevation
are
furnished
with
little
gardens
wherever
soil
can
be
made
to
lie
which
though
making
scarce
any
show
at
a
distance
constitute
charming
surprises
to
the
appreciative
observer
in
these
bits
of
leanness
a
few
birds
find
grateful
homes
having
no
acquaintance
with
man
they
fear
no
ill
and
flock
curiously
about
the
stranger
almost
allowing
themselves
to
be
taken
in
the
hand
in
so
wild
and
so
beautiful
a
region
was
spent
my
first
day
every
sight
and
sound
inspiring
leading
one
far
out
of
himself
yet
feeding
and
building
up
his
individuality
now
came
the
solemn
silent
evening
long
blue
spiky
shadows
crept
out
across
the
while
a
rosy
glow
at
first
scarce
discernible
gradually
deepened
and
suffused
every
flushing
the
glaciers
and
the
harsh
crags
above
them
this
was
the
alpenglow
to
me
one
of
the
most
impressive
of
all
the
terrestrial
manifestations
of
god
at
the
touch
of
this
divine
light
the
mountains
seemed
to
kindle
to
a
rapt
religious
consciousness
and
stood
hushed
and
waiting
like
devout
worshipers
just
before
the
alpenglow
began
to
fade
two
crimson
clouds
came
streaming
across
the
summit
like
wings
of
flame
rendering
the
sublime
scene
yet
more
impressive
then
came
darkness
and
the
stars
icy
ritter
was
still
miles
away
but
i
could
proceed
no
farther
that
night
i
found
a
good
campground
on
the
rim
of
a
glacier
basin
about
feet
above
the
sea
a
small
lake
nestles
in
the
bottom
of
it
from
which
i
got
water
for
my
tea
and
a
thicket
near
by
furnished
abundance
of
resiny
somber
peaks
hacked
and
shattered
circled
around
the
horizon
wearing
a
savage
aspect
in
the
gloaming
and
a
waterfall
chanted
solemnly
across
the
lake
on
its
way
down
from
the
foot
of
a
glacier
the
fall
and
the
lake
and
the
glacier
were
almost
equally
bare
while
the
scraggy
pines
anchored
in
the
were
so
dwarfed
and
shorn
by
that
you
might
walk
over
their
tops
in
tone
and
aspect
the
scene
was
one
of
the
most
desolate
i
ever
beheld
but
the
darkest
scriptures
of
the
mountains
are
illumined
with
bright
passages
of
love
that
never
fail
to
make
themselves
felt
when
one
is
alone
i
made
my
bed
in
a
nook
of
the
where
the
branches
were
pressed
and
crinkled
overhead
like
a
roof
and
bent
down
around
the
sides
these
are
the
best
bedchambers
the
high
mountains
as
well
ventilated
full
of
spicy
odors
and
with
plenty
of
needles
to
sing
one
asleep
i
little
expected
company
but
creeping
in
through
a
low
i
found
five
or
six
birds
nestling
among
the
tassels
the
began
to
blow
soon
after
dark
at
first
only
a
gentle
breathing
but
increasing
toward
midnight
to
a
rough
gale
that
fell
upon
my
leafy
roof
in
ragged
surges
like
a
cascade
bearing
wild
sounds
from
the
crags
overhead
the
waterfall
sang
in
chorus
filling
the
old
with
its
solemn
roar
and
seeming
to
increase
in
power
as
the
night
voice
for
such
a
landscape
i
had
to
creep
out
many
times
to
the
fire
during
the
night
for
it
was
biting
cold
and
i
had
no
blankets
gladly
i
welcomed
the
morning
star
the
dawn
in
the
dry
wavering
air
of
the
desert
was
glorious
everything
encouraged
my
undertaking
and
betokened
success
there
was
no
cloud
in
the
sky
no
in
the
wind
breakfast
of
bread
and
tea
was
soon
made
i
fastened
a
hard
durable
crust
to
my
belt
by
way
of
provision
in
case
i
should
be
compelled
to
pass
a
night
on
the
then
securing
the
remainder
of
my
little
stock
against
wolves
and
i
set
forth
free
and
hopeful
how
glorious
a
greeting
the
sun
gives
the
mountains
to
behold
this
alone
is
worth
the
pains
of
any
excursion
a
thousand
times
over
the
highest
peaks
burned
like
islands
in
a
sea
of
liquid
shade
then
the
lower
peaks
and
spires
caught
the
glow
and
long
lances
of
light
streaming
through
many
a
notch
and
pass
fell
thick
on
the
frozen
meadows
the
majestic
form
of
ritter
was
full
in
sight
and
i
pushed
rapidly
on
over
rounded
and
pavements
my
shoes
making
a
clanking
sound
suddenly
hushed
now
and
then
in
rugs
of
bryanthus
and
sedgy
soft
as
moss
here
too
in
this
of
desolation
i
met
cassiope
growing
in
fringes
among
the
battered
rocks
her
blossoms
had
faded
long
ago
but
they
were
still
clinging
with
happy
memories
to
the
evergreen
sprays
and
still
so
beautiful
as
to
thrill
every
fiber
of
being
winter
and
summer
you
may
hear
her
voice
the
low
sweet
melody
of
her
purple
bells
no
evangel
among
all
the
mountain
plants
speaks
love
more
plainly
than
cassiope
where
she
dwells
the
redemption
of
the
coldest
solitude
is
complete
the
very
rocks
and
glaciers
seem
to
feel
her
presence
and
become
imbued
with
her
own
fountain
sweetness
all
things
were
warming
and
awakening
frozen
rills
began
to
flow
the
marmots
came
out
of
their
nests
in
and
climbed
sunny
rocks
to
bask
and
the
sparrows
were
flitting
about
seeking
their
breakfasts
the
lakes
seen
from
every
were
brilliantly
rippled
and
spangled
shimmering
like
the
thickets
of
the
low
dwarf
pines
the
rocks
too
seemed
responsive
to
the
vital
and
thrilling
alike
i
strode
on
exhilarated
as
if
never
more
to
feel
fatigue
limbs
moving
of
themselves
every
sense
unfolding
like
the
thawing
flowers
to
take
part
in
the
new
day
harmony
all
along
my
course
thus
far
excepting
when
down
in
the
cañons
the
landscapes
were
mostly
open
to
me
and
expansive
at
least
on
one
side
on
the
left
were
the
purple
plains
of
mono
reposing
dreamily
and
warm
on
the
right
the
near
peaks
springing
keenly
into
the
thin
sky
with
more
and
more
impressive
sublimity
but
these
larger
views
were
at
length
lost
rugged
spurs
and
moraines
and
huge
projecting
buttresses
began
to
shut
me
in
every
feature
became
more
rigidly
alpine
without
however
producing
any
chilling
effect
for
going
to
the
mountains
is
like
going
home
we
always
find
that
the
strangest
objects
in
these
fountain
wilds
are
in
some
degree
familiar
and
we
look
upon
them
with
a
vague
sense
of
having
seen
them
before
illustration
general
grant
tree
general
grant
national
park
on
the
southern
shore
of
a
frozen
lake
i
encountered
an
extensive
field
of
hard
granular
snow
up
which
i
scampered
in
fine
tone
intending
to
follow
it
to
its
head
and
cross
the
rocky
spur
against
which
it
leans
hoping
thus
to
come
direct
upon
the
base
of
the
main
ritter
peak
the
surface
was
pitted
with
oval
hollows
made
by
stones
and
drifted
that
had
melted
themselves
into
the
mass
by
the
radiation
of
absorbed
these
afforded
good
footholds
but
the
surface
curved
more
and
more
steeply
at
the
head
and
the
pits
became
shallower
and
less
abundant
until
i
found
myself
in
danger
of
being
shed
off
like
avalanching
snow
i
persisted
however
creeping
on
all
fours
and
shuffling
up
the
smoothest
places
on
my
back
as
i
had
often
done
on
burnished
granite
until
after
slipping
several
times
i
was
compelled
to
retrace
my
course
to
the
bottom
and
make
my
way
around
the
west
end
of
the
lake
and
thence
up
to
the
summit
of
the
divide
between
the
head
waters
of
rush
creek
and
the
northernmost
tributaries
of
the
san
joaquin
arriving
on
the
summit
of
this
dividing
crest
one
of
the
most
exciting
pieces
of
pure
wilderness
was
disclosed
that
i
ever
discovered
in
all
my
mountaineering
there
immediately
in
front
loomed
the
majestic
mass
of
mount
ritter
with
a
glacier
swooping
down
its
face
nearly
to
my
feet
then
curving
westward
and
pouring
its
frozen
flood
into
a
dark
blue
lake
whose
shores
were
bound
with
precipices
of
crystalline
snow
while
a
deep
chasm
drawn
between
the
divide
and
the
glacier
separated
the
massive
picture
from
everything
else
i
could
see
only
the
one
sublime
mountain
the
one
glacier
the
one
lake
the
whole
veiled
with
one
blue
ice
and
water
close
together
without
a
single
leaf
or
sign
of
life
after
gazing
spellbound
i
began
instinctively
to
scrutinize
every
notch
and
gorge
and
weathered
buttress
of
the
mountain
with
reference
to
making
the
ascent
the
entire
front
above
the
glacier
appeared
as
one
tremendous
precipice
slightly
receding
at
the
top
and
bristling
with
spires
and
pinnacles
set
above
one
another
in
formidable
array
massive
battlements
stood
forward
here
and
there
hacked
at
the
top
with
angular
notches
and
separated
by
frosty
gullies
and
recesses
that
have
been
veiled
in
shadow
ever
since
their
creation
while
to
right
and
left
as
far
as
i
could
see
were
huge
crumbling
buttresses
offering
no
hope
to
the
climber
the
head
of
the
glacier
sends
up
a
few
branches
through
narrow
but
these
seemed
too
steep
and
short
to
be
available
especially
as
i
had
no
ax
with
which
to
cut
steps
and
the
numerous
gullies
down
which
stones
and
snow
are
avalanched
seemed
hopelessly
steep
besides
being
interrupted
by
vertical
cliffs
while
the
whole
front
was
rendered
still
more
terribly
forbidding
by
the
chill
shadow
and
the
gloomy
blackness
of
the
rocks
descending
the
divide
in
a
hesitating
mood
i
picked
my
way
across
the
yawning
chasm
at
the
foot
and
climbed
out
upon
the
glacier
there
were
no
meadows
now
to
cheer
with
their
brave
colors
nor
could
i
hear
the
sparrows
whose
cheery
notes
so
often
relieve
the
silence
of
our
highest
mountains
the
only
sounds
were
the
gurgling
of
small
rills
down
in
the
veins
and
crevasses
of
the
glacier
and
now
and
then
the
rattling
report
of
falling
stones
with
the
echoes
they
shot
out
into
the
crisp
air
i
could
not
distinctly
hope
to
reach
the
summit
from
this
side
yet
i
moved
on
across
the
glacier
as
if
driven
by
fate
contending
with
myself
the
season
is
too
far
spent
i
said
and
even
should
i
be
successful
i
might
be
on
the
mountain
and
in
the
with
the
cliffs
and
crevasses
covered
with
snow
how
could
i
escape
no
i
must
wait
till
next
summer
i
would
only
approach
the
mountain
now
and
inspect
it
creep
about
its
flanks
learn
what
i
could
of
its
history
holding
myself
ready
to
flee
on
the
approach
of
the
first
but
we
little
know
until
tried
how
much
of
the
uncontrollable
there
is
in
us
urging
across
glaciers
and
torrents
and
up
dangerous
heights
let
the
judgment
forbid
as
it
may
i
succeeded
in
gaining
the
foot
of
the
cliff
on
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
glacier
and
there
discovered
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
avalanche
gully
through
which
i
began
to
climb
intending
to
follow
it
as
far
as
possible
and
at
least
obtain
some
fine
wild
views
for
my
pains
its
general
course
is
oblique
to
the
plane
of
the
and
the
metamorphic
slates
of
which
the
mountain
is
built
are
cut
by
cleavage
planes
in
such
a
way
that
they
weather
off
in
angular
blocks
giving
rise
to
irregular
steps
that
greatly
facilitate
climbing
on
the
sheer
places
i
thus
made
my
way
into
a
wilderness
of
crumbling
spires
and
battlements
built
together
in
bewildering
combinations
and
glazed
in
many
places
with
a
thin
coating
of
ice
which
i
had
to
hammer
off
with
stones
the
situation
was
becoming
gradually
more
perilous
but
having
passed
several
dangerous
spots
i
dared
not
think
of
descending
for
so
steep
was
the
entire
ascent
one
would
inevitably
fall
to
the
glacier
in
case
a
single
misstep
were
made
knowing
therefore
the
tried
danger
beneath
i
became
all
the
more
anxious
concerning
the
developments
to
be
made
above
and
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
vague
foreboding
of
what
actually
befell
not
that
i
was
given
to
fear
but
rather
because
my
instincts
usually
so
positive
and
true
seemed
vitiated
in
some
way
and
were
leading
me
astray
at
length
after
attaining
an
elevation
of
about
feet
i
found
myself
at
the
foot
of
a
sheer
drop
in
the
bed
of
the
avalanche
channel
i
was
tracing
which
seemed
absolutely
to
bar
further
progress
it
was
only
about
or
fifty
feet
high
and
somewhat
roughened
by
fissures
and
projections
but
these
seemed
so
slight
and
insecure
as
footholds
that
i
tried
hard
to
avoid
the
precipice
altogether
by
scaling
the
wall
of
the
channel
on
either
side
but
though
less
steep
the
walls
were
smoother
than
the
obstructing
rock
and
repeated
efforts
only
showed
that
i
must
either
go
right
ahead
or
turn
back
the
tried
dangers
beneath
seemed
even
greater
than
that
of
the
cliff
in
front
therefore
after
scanning
its
face
again
and
again
i
began
to
scale
it
picking
my
holds
with
intense
caution
after
gaining
a
point
about
halfway
to
the
top
i
was
suddenly
brought
to
a
dead
stop
with
arms
outspread
clinging
close
to
the
face
of
the
rock
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
either
up
or
down
my
doom
appeared
fixed
i
fall
there
would
be
a
moment
of
bewilderment
and
then
a
lifeless
rumble
down
the
one
general
precipice
to
the
glacier
below
when
this
final
danger
flashed
upon
me
i
became
for
the
first
time
since
setting
foot
on
the
mountains
and
my
mind
seemed
to
fill
with
a
stifling
smoke
but
this
terrible
eclipse
lasted
only
a
moment
when
life
blazed
forth
again
with
preternatural
clearness
i
seemed
suddenly
to
become
possessed
of
a
new
sense
the
other
self
bygone
experiences
instinct
or
guardian
angel
it
what
you
will
forward
and
assumed
control
then
my
trembling
muscles
became
firm
again
every
rift
and
flaw
in
the
rock
was
seen
as
through
a
microscope
and
my
limbs
moved
with
a
positiveness
and
precision
with
which
i
seemed
to
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
had
i
been
borne
aloft
upon
wings
my
deliverance
could
not
have
been
more
complete
above
this
memorable
spot
the
face
of
the
mountain
is
still
more
savagely
hacked
and
torn
it
is
a
maze
of
yawning
chasms
and
gullies
in
the
angles
of
which
rise
beetling
crags
and
piles
of
detached
boulders
that
seem
to
have
been
gotten
ready
to
be
launched
below
but
the
strange
influx
of
strength
i
had
received
seemed
inexhaustible
i
found
a
way
without
effort
and
soon
stood
upon
the
topmost
crag
in
the
blessed
light
how
truly
glorious
the
landscape
circled
around
this
noble
summit
mountains
valleys
innumerable
glaciers
and
meadows
rivers
and
lakes
with
the
wide
blue
sky
bent
tenderly
over
them
all
but
in
my
first
hour
of
freedom
from
that
terrible
shadow
the
sunlight
in
which
i
was
laving
seemed
all
in
all
looking
southward
along
the
axis
of
the
range
the
eye
is
first
caught
by
a
row
of
exceedingly
sharp
and
slender
spires
which
rise
openly
to
a
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
above
a
series
of
short
residual
glaciers
that
lean
back
against
their
bases
their
fantastic
sculpture
and
the
unrelieved
sharpness
with
which
they
spring
out
of
the
ice
rendering
them
peculiarly
wild
and
striking
these
are
beyond
them
you
behold
a
sublime
wilderness
of
mountains
their
snowy
summits
towering
together
in
crowded
abundance
peak
beyond
peak
swelling
higher
higher
as
they
sweep
on
southward
until
the
culminating
point
of
the
range
is
reached
on
mount
whitney
near
the
head
of
the
kern
river
at
an
elevation
of
nearly
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
westward
the
general
flank
of
the
range
is
seen
flowing
sublimely
away
from
the
sharp
summits
in
smooth
undulations
a
sea
of
huge
gray
granite
waves
dotted
with
lakes
and
meadows
and
fluted
with
stupendous
cañons
that
grow
steadily
deeper
as
they
recede
in
the
distance
below
this
gray
region
lies
the
dark
forest
zone
broken
here
and
there
by
upswelling
ridges
and
domes
and
yet
beyond
lies
a
yellow
hazy
belt
marking
the
broad
plain
of
the
san
joaquin
bounded
on
its
farther
side
by
the
blue
mountains
of
the
coast
turning
now
to
the
northward
there
in
the
immediate
foreground
is
the
glorious
sierra
crown
with
cathedral
peak
a
temple
of
marvelous
architecture
a
few
degrees
to
the
left
of
it
the
gray
massive
form
of
mammoth
mountain
to
the
right
while
mounts
ord
gibbs
dana
conness
tower
peak
castle
peak
silver
mountain
and
a
host
of
noble
companions
as
yet
nameless
make
a
sublime
show
along
the
axis
of
the
range
eastward
the
whole
region
seems
a
land
of
desolation
covered
with
beautiful
light
the
torrid
volcanic
basin
of
mono
with
its
one
bare
lake
fourteen
miles
long
valley
and
the
broad
lava
at
its
head
dotted
with
craters
and
the
massive
inyo
range
rivaling
even
the
sierra
in
height
these
are
spread
beneath
you
with
countless
ranges
beyond
passing
and
overlapping
one
another
and
fading
on
the
glowing
horizon
illustration
map
of
the
yosemite
valley
at
a
distance
of
less
than
feet
below
the
summit
of
mount
ritter
you
may
find
tributaries
of
the
san
joaquin
and
rivers
bursting
forth
from
the
ice
and
snow
of
the
glaciers
that
load
its
flanks
while
a
little
to
the
north
of
here
are
found
the
highest
affluents
of
the
tuolumne
and
merced
thus
the
fountains
of
four
of
the
principal
rivers
of
california
are
within
a
radius
of
four
or
five
miles
lakes
are
seen
gleaming
in
all
sorts
of
places
or
oval
or
square
like
very
mirrors
others
narrow
and
sinuous
drawn
close
around
the
peaks
like
silver
zones
the
highest
reflecting
only
rocks
snow
and
the
sky
but
neither
these
nor
the
glaciers
nor
the
bits
of
brown
meadow
and
moorland
that
occur
here
and
there
are
large
enough
to
make
any
marked
impression
upon
the
mighty
wilderness
of
mountains
the
eye
rejoicing
in
its
freedom
roves
about
the
vast
expanse
yet
returns
again
and
again
to
the
fountain
peaks
perhaps
some
one
of
the
multitude
excites
special
attention
some
gigantic
castle
with
turret
and
battlement
or
some
gothic
cathedral
more
abundantly
spired
than
but
generally
when
looking
for
the
first
time
from
an
standpoint
like
this
the
inexperienced
observer
is
oppressed
by
the
incomprehensible
grandeur
variety
and
abundance
of
the
mountains
rising
shoulder
to
shoulder
beyond
the
reach
of
vision
and
it
is
only
after
they
have
been
studied
one
by
one
long
and
lovingly
that
their
harmonies
become
manifest
then
penetrate
the
wilderness
where
you
may
the
main
telling
features
to
which
all
the
surrounding
topography
is
subordinate
are
quickly
perceived
and
the
most
complicated
clusters
of
peaks
stand
revealed
harmoniously
correlated
and
fashioned
like
works
of
monuments
of
the
ancient
that
brought
them
into
relief
from
the
general
mass
of
the
range
the
cañons
too
some
of
them
a
mile
deep
mazing
wildly
through
the
mighty
host
of
mountains
however
lawless
and
ungovernable
at
first
sight
they
appear
are
at
length
recognized
as
the
necessary
effects
of
causes
which
followed
each
other
in
harmonious
poems
carved
on
tables
of
simplest
and
most
emphatic
of
her
glacial
compositions
could
we
have
been
here
to
observe
during
the
glacial
period
we
should
have
overlooked
a
wrinkled
ocean
of
ice
as
continuous
as
that
now
covering
the
landscapes
of
greenland
filling
every
valley
and
cañon
with
only
the
tops
of
the
fountain
peaks
rising
darkly
above
the
like
islets
in
a
stormy
islets
the
only
hints
of
the
glorious
landscapes
now
smiling
in
the
sun
standing
here
in
the
deep
brooding
silence
all
the
wilderness
seems
motionless
as
if
the
work
of
creation
were
done
but
in
the
midst
of
this
outer
steadfastness
we
know
there
is
incessant
motion
and
change
ever
and
anon
avalanches
are
falling
from
yonder
peaks
these
glaciers
seemingly
wedged
and
immovable
are
flowing
like
water
and
grinding
the
rocks
beneath
them
the
lakes
are
lapping
their
granite
shores
and
wearing
them
away
and
every
one
of
these
rills
and
young
rivers
is
fretting
the
air
into
music
and
carrying
the
mountains
to
the
plains
here
are
the
roots
of
all
the
life
of
the
valleys
and
here
more
simply
than
elsewhere
is
the
eternal
flux
of
nature
manifested
ice
changing
to
water
lakes
to
meadows
and
mountains
to
plains
and
while
we
thus
contemplate
methods
of
landscape
creation
and
reading
the
records
she
has
carved
on
the
rocks
reconstruct
however
imperfectly
the
landscapes
of
the
past
we
also
learn
that
as
these
we
now
behold
have
succeeded
those
of
the
age
so
they
in
turn
are
withering
and
vanishing
to
be
succeeded
by
others
yet
unborn
but
in
the
midst
of
these
fine
lessons
and
landscapes
i
had
to
remember
that
the
sun
was
wheeling
far
to
the
west
while
a
new
way
down
the
mountain
had
to
be
discovered
to
some
point
on
the
timber
line
where
i
could
have
a
fire
for
i
had
not
even
burdened
myself
with
a
coat
i
first
scanned
the
western
spurs
hoping
some
way
might
appear
through
which
i
might
reach
the
northern
glacier
and
cross
its
snout
or
pass
around
the
lake
into
which
it
flows
and
thus
strike
my
morning
track
this
route
was
soon
sufficiently
unfolded
to
show
that
if
practicable
at
all
it
would
require
so
much
time
that
reaching
camp
that
night
would
be
out
of
the
question
i
therefore
scrambled
back
eastward
descending
the
southern
slopes
obliquely
at
the
same
time
here
the
crags
seemed
less
formidable
and
the
head
of
a
glacier
that
flows
northeast
came
in
sight
which
i
determined
to
follow
as
far
as
possible
hoping
thus
to
make
my
way
to
the
foot
of
the
peak
on
the
east
side
and
thence
across
the
intervening
cañons
and
ridges
to
camp
the
inclination
of
the
glacier
is
quite
moderate
at
the
head
and
as
the
sun
had
softened
the
i
made
safe
and
rapid
progress
running
and
sliding
and
keeping
up
a
sharp
outlook
for
crevasses
about
half
a
mile
from
the
head
there
is
an
where
the
glacier
pours
over
a
sharp
declivity
and
is
shattered
into
massive
blocks
separated
by
deep
blue
fissures
to
thread
my
way
through
the
slippery
mazes
of
this
crevassed
portion
seemed
impossible
and
i
endeavored
to
avoid
it
by
climbing
off
to
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
but
the
slopes
rapidly
steepened
and
at
length
fell
away
in
sheer
precipices
compelling
a
return
to
the
ice
fortunately
the
day
had
been
warm
enough
to
loosen
the
so
as
to
admit
of
hollows
being
dug
in
the
rotten
portions
of
the
blocks
thus
enabling
me
to
pick
my
way
with
far
less
difficulty
than
i
had
anticipated
continuing
down
over
the
snout
and
along
the
left
lateral
moraine
was
only
a
confident
saunter
showing
that
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
by
way
of
this
glacier
is
easy
provided
one
is
armed
with
an
ax
to
cut
steps
here
and
there
the
lower
end
of
the
glacier
was
beautifully
waved
and
barred
by
the
outcropping
edges
of
the
bedded
which
represent
the
annual
snowfalls
and
to
some
extent
the
irregularities
of
structure
caused
by
the
weathering
of
the
walls
of
crevasses
and
by
separate
snowfalls
which
have
been
followed
by
rain
hail
thawing
and
freezing
etc
small
rills
were
gliding
and
swirling
over
the
melting
surface
with
a
smooth
oily
appearance
in
channels
of
pure
quick
compliant
movements
contrasting
most
impressively
with
the
rigid
invisible
flow
of
the
glacier
itself
on
whose
back
they
all
were
riding
night
drew
near
before
i
reached
the
eastern
base
of
the
mountain
and
my
camp
lay
many
a
rugged
mile
to
the
north
but
ultimate
success
was
assured
it
was
now
only
a
matter
of
endurance
and
ordinary
the
sunset
was
if
possible
yet
more
beautiful
than
that
of
the
day
before
the
mono
landscape
seemed
to
be
fairly
saturated
with
warm
purple
light
the
peaks
marshaled
along
the
summit
were
in
shadow
but
through
every
notch
and
pass
streamed
vivid
soothing
and
irradiating
their
rough
black
angles
while
companies
of
small
luminous
clouds
hovered
above
them
like
very
angels
of
light
darkness
came
on
but
i
found
my
way
by
the
trends
of
the
cañons
and
the
peaks
projected
against
the
sky
all
excitement
died
with
the
light
and
then
i
was
weary
but
the
joyful
sound
of
the
waterfall
across
the
lake
was
heard
at
last
and
soon
the
stars
were
seen
reflected
in
the
lake
itself
taking
my
bearings
from
these
i
discovered
the
little
pine
thicket
in
which
my
nest
was
and
then
i
had
a
rest
such
as
only
a
tired
mountaineer
may
enjoy
after
lying
loose
and
lost
for
awhile
i
made
a
sunrise
fire
went
down
to
the
lake
dashed
water
on
my
head
and
dipped
a
cupful
for
tea
the
revival
brought
about
by
bread
and
tea
was
as
complete
as
the
exhaustion
from
excessive
enjoyment
and
toil
then
i
crept
beneath
the
to
bed
the
wind
was
frosty
and
the
fire
burned
low
but
my
sleep
was
none
the
less
sound
and
the
evening
constellations
had
swept
far
to
the
west
before
i
awoke
after
thawing
and
resting
in
the
morning
sunshine
i
sauntered
home
is
back
to
the
tuolumne
camp
away
toward
a
cluster
of
peaks
that
hold
the
fountain
snows
of
one
of
the
north
tributaries
of
rush
creek
here
i
discovered
a
group
of
beautiful
glacier
lakes
nestled
together
in
a
grand
amphitheater
toward
evening
i
crossed
the
divide
separating
the
mono
waters
from
those
of
the
tuolumne
and
entered
the
glacier
basin
that
now
holds
the
fountain
snows
of
the
stream
that
forms
the
upper
tuolumne
cascades
this
stream
i
traced
down
through
its
many
dells
and
gorges
meadows
and
bogs
reaching
the
brink
of
the
main
tuolumne
at
dusk
a
loud
whoop
for
the
artists
was
answered
again
and
again
their
came
in
sight
and
half
an
hour
afterward
i
was
with
them
they
seemed
unreasonably
glad
to
see
me
i
had
been
absent
only
three
days
nevertheless
though
the
weather
was
fine
they
had
already
been
weighing
chances
as
to
whether
i
would
ever
return
and
trying
to
decide
whether
they
should
wait
longer
or
begin
to
seek
their
way
back
to
the
lowlands
now
their
curious
troubles
were
over
they
packed
their
precious
sketches
and
next
morning
we
set
out
homeward
bound
and
in
two
days
entered
the
yosemite
valley
from
the
north
by
way
of
indian
cañon
chapter
v
the
passes
the
sustained
grandeur
of
the
high
sierra
is
strikingly
illustrated
by
the
great
height
of
the
passes
between
latitude
and
the
lowest

gap
gorge
or
notch
of
any
kind
cutting
across
the
axis
of
the
range
as
far
as
i
have
discovered
exceeds
feet
in
height
above
the
level
of
the
sea
while
the
average
height
of
all
that
are
in
use
either
by
indians
or
whites
is
perhaps
not
less
than
feet
and
not
one
of
these
is

through
what
is
known
as

of
which
is
about

also
been
built
through
the

were
hauled
from

still
farther

a
considerable
number
of
comparatively
low

occur
some
of
which
are
accessible
to
wheeled
vehicles
and
through
these
rugged
defiles
during
the
exciting
years
of
the
gold
period
long
with
cattle
wearily
toiled
after
the
adventurers
had
escaped
a
thousand
dangers
and
had
crawled
thousands
of
miles
across
the
plains
the
snowy
sierra
at
last
loomed
in
sight
the
eastern
wall
of
the
land
of
gold
and
as
with
shaded
eyes
they
gazed
through
the
tremulous
haze
of
the
desert
with
what
joy
must
they
have
descried
the
pass
through
which
they
were
to
enter
the
better
land
of
their
hopes
and
dreams
between
the
sonora
pass
and
the
southern
extremity
of
the
high
sierra
a
distance
of
nearly
miles
there
are
only
five
passes
through
which
trails
conduct
from
one
side
of
the
range
to
the
other
these
are
barely
practicable
for
animals
a
pass
in
these
regions
meaning
simply
any
notch
or
cañon
through
which
one
may
by
the
exercise
of
unlimited
patience
make
out
to
lead
a
mule
or
a
mustang
animals
that
can
slide
or
jump
as
well
as
walk
only
three
of
the
five
passes
may
be
said
to
be
in
use
viz
the
kearsarge
mono
and
virginia

the
tracks
leading
through
the
others
being
only
obscure

and

where
the

leave
no

only
skilled

are
able
to
detect
the
marks
that
serve
to
guide
the
indians
such
as
slight
abrasions
of
the
looser
rocks
the
displacement
of
stones
here
and
there
and
bent
bushes
and
weeds
a
general
knowledge
of
the
topography
is
then
the
main
guide
enabling
one
to
determine
where
the
trail
ought
to
go
one
of
these
indian

crosses
the

by
a
nameless
pass
between

the

used
every

from

by
hunters
prospectors
and
and
to
some
extent
by
enterprising
also
for
besides
the
surpassing
grandeur
of
the
scenery
about
the

the
trail
in
ascending
the
western
flank
of

conducts
through
a
grove
of
the
giant
sequoias
and
through
the
magnificent

of

fork
of

this
is
perhaps
the
highest
traveled
pass
on

continent

the

pass
lies
to
the
east
of
yosemite
valley
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
south
fork
of
the
tuolumne
this
is
the
best
known
and
most
extensively
traveled
of
all
that
exist
in
the
high
sierra
a
trail
was
made
through
it
about
the
time
of
the
mono
gold
excitement
in
the
year
by
adventurous
miners
and
who
would
build
a
trail
down
the
throat
of
darkest
erebus
on
the
way
to
gold
though
more
than
a
thousand
feet
lower
than
the
kearsarge
it
is
scarcely
less
sublime
in
while
in
snowy
falling
water
it
far
surpasses
it
being
so
favorably
situated
for
the
stream
of
yosemite
travel
the
more
adventurous
tourists
cross
over
through
this
glorious
gateway
to
the
volcanic
region
around
mono
lake
it
has
therefore
gained
a
name
and
fame
above
every
other
pass
in
the
range
according
to
the
few
barometrical
observations
made
upon
it
its
highest
point
is
feet
above
the
sea
the
other
pass
of
the
five
we
have
been
considering
is
somewhat
lower
and
crosses
the
axis
of
the
range
a
few
miles
to
the
north
of
the
mono
pass
at
the
head
of
the
southernmost
tributary
of
river
it
is
used
chiefly
by
roaming
bands
of
the
pah
ute
indians
and
but
leaving
wheels
and
animals
out
of
the
question
the
free
mountaineer
with
a
sack
of
bread
on
his
shoulders
and
an
ax
to
cut
steps
in
ice
and
frozen
snow
can
make
his
way
across
the
range
almost
everywhere
and
at
any
time
of
year
when
the
weather
is
calm
to
him
nearly
every
notch
between
the
peaks
is
a
pass
though
much
patient
is
at
times
required
up
and
down
steeply
inclined
glaciers
with
cautious
climbing
over
precipices
that
at
first
sight
would
seem
hopelessly
inaccessible
in
pursuing
my
studies
i
have
crossed
from
side
to
side
of
the
range
at
intervals
of
a
few
miles
all
along
the
highest
portion
of
the
chain
with
far
less
real
danger
than
one
would
naturally
count
on
and
what
fine
wildness
was
thus
and
avalanches
lakes
and
waterfalls
gardens
and
meadows
and
interesting
those
will
ever
know
who
give
the
freest
and
most
buoyant
portion
of
their
lives
to
climbing
and
seeing
for
themselves
to
the
timid
traveler
fresh
from
the
sedimentary
levels
of
the
lowlands
these
highways
however
picturesque
and
grand
seem
terribly
dead
gloomy
gashes
in
the
bones
of
the
mountains
and
of
all
ways
the
ones
to
be
most
cautiously
avoided
yet
they
are
full
of
the
finest
and
most
telling
examples
of
love
and
though
hard
to
travel
none
are
safer
for
they
lead
through
regions
that
lie
far
above
the
ordinary
haunts
of
the
devil
and
of
the
pestilence
that
walks
in
darkness
true
there
are
innumerable
places
where
the
careless
step
will
be
the
last
step
and
a
rock
falling
from
the
cliffs
may
crush
without
warning
like
lightning
from
the
sky
but
what
then
accidents
in
the
mountains
are
less
common
than
in
the
lowlands
and
these
mountain
mansions
are
decent
delightful
even
divine
places
to
die
in
compared
with
the
doleful
chambers
of
civilization
few
places
in
this
world
are
more
dangerous
than
home
fear
not
therefore
to
try
the
they
will
kill
care
save
you
from
deadly
apathy
set
you
free
and
call
forth
every
faculty
into
vigorous
enthusiastic
action
even
the
sick
should
try
these
dangerous
passes
because
for
every
unfortunate
they
kill
they
cure
a
thousand
all
the
passes
make
their
steepest
ascents
on
the
eastern
flank
on
this
side
the
average
rise
is
not
far
from
a
thousand
feet
to
the
mile
while
on
the
west
it
is
about
two
hundred
feet
another
marked
difference
between
the
eastern
and
western
portions
of
the
passes
is
that
the
former
begin
at
the
very
foot
of
the
range
while
the
latter
can
hardly
be
said
to
begin
lower
than
an
elevation
of
from
seven
to
ten
thousand
feet
approaching
the
range
from
the
gray
levels
of
mono
and
valley
on
the
east
the
traveler
sees
before
him
the
steep
short
passes
in
full
view
fenced
in
by
rugged
spurs
that
come
plunging
down
from
the
shoulders
of
the
peaks
on
either
side
the
courses
of
the
more
direct
being
disclosed
from
top
to
bottom
without
interruption
but
from
the
west
one
sees
nothing
of
the
way
he
may
be
seeking
until
near
the
summit
after
days
have
been
spent
in
threading
the
forests
growing
on
the
main
dividing
ridges
between
the
river
cañons
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
surely
the
animals
of
every
kind
fall
into
the
same
trails
the
more
rugged
and
inaccessible
the
general
character
of
the
topography
of
any
particular
region
the
more
surely
will
the
trails
of
white
men
indians
bears
wild
sheep
be
found
converging
into
the
best
passes
the
indians
of
the
western
slope
venture
cautiously
over
the
passes
in
settled
weather
to
attend
dances
and
obtain
loads
of
and
the
larvae
of
a
small
fly
that
breeds
in
mono
and
lakes
which
when
dried
forms
an
important
article
of
food
while
the
pah
utes
cross
over
from
the
east
to
hunt
the
deer
and
obtain
supplies
of
acorns
and
it
is
truly
astonishing
to
see
what
immense
loads
the
haggard
old
squaws
make
out
to
carry
through
these
rough
passes
oftentimes
for
a
distance
of
sixty
or
seventy
miles
they
are
always
accompanied
by
the
men
who
stride
on
unburdened
and
erect
a
little
in
advance
kindly
stooping
at
difficult
places
to
pile
for
their
patient
wives
just
as
they
would
prepare
the
way
for
their
ponies
bears
evince
great
sagacity
as
mountaineers
but
although
they
are
tireless
and
enterprising
travelers
they
seldom
cross
the
range
i
have
several
times
tracked
them
through
the
mono
pass
but
only
in
late
years
after
cattle
and
sheep
had
passed
that
way
when
they
doubtless
were
following
to
feed
on
the
stragglers
and
on
those
that
had
been
killed
by
falling
over
the
rocks
even
the
wild
sheep
the
best
mountaineers
of
all
choose
regular
passes
in
making
journeys
across
the
summits
deer
seldom
cross
the
range
in
either
direction
i
have
never
yet
observed
a
single
specimen
of
the
of
the
great
basin
west
of
the
summit
and
rarely
one
of
the
species
on
the
eastern
slope
notwithstanding
many
of
the
latter
ascend
the
range
nearly
to
the
summit
every
summer
to
feed
in
the
wild
gardens
and
bring
forth
their
young
the
glaciers
are
the
and
it
is
by
them
that
the
courses
of
all
mountaineers
are
predestined
without
exception
every
pass
in
the
sierra
was
created
by
them
without
the
slightest
aid
or
predetermining
guidance
from
any
of
the
cataclysmic
agents
i
have
seen
elaborate
statements
of
the
amount
of
drilling
and
blasting
accomplished
in
the
construction
of
the
railroad
across
the
sierra
above
donner
lake
but
for
every
pound
of
rock
moved
in
this
way
the
glaciers
which
descended
east
and
west
through
this
same
pass
crushed
and
carried
away
more
than
a
hundred
tons
the
practicable
are
simply
those
portions
of
the
range
more
degraded
by
glacial
action
than
the
adjacent
portions
and
degraded
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
the
summits
rounded
instead
of
sharp
while
the
peaks
from
the
superior
strength
and
hardness
of
their
rocks
or
from
more
favorable
position
having
suffered
less
degradation
are
left
towering
above
the
passes
as
if
they
had
been
heaved
into
the
sky
by
some
force
acting
from
beneath
the
scenery
of
all
the
passes
especially
at
the
head
is
of
the
wildest
and
grandest
description
peaks
massed
together
and
laden
around
their
bases
with
ice
and
snow
chains
of
glacier
lakes
cascading
streams
in
endless
variety
with
glorious
views
westward
over
a
sea
of
rocks
and
woods
and
eastward
over
strange
ashy
plains
volcanoes
and
the
dry
ranges
of
the
great
basin
every
pass
however
possesses
treasures
of
beauty
all
its
own
having
thus
in
a
general
way
indicated
the
height
leading
features
and
distribution
of
the
principal
passes
i
will
now
endeavor
to
describe
the
mono
pass
in
particular
which
may
i
think
be
regarded
as
a
fair
example
of
the
higher
alpine
passes
in
general
the
main
portion
of
the
mono
pass
is
formed
by
bloody
cañon
which
begins
at
the
summit
of
the
range
and
runs
in
a
general
direction
to
the
edge
of
the
mono
plain
the
first
white
men
who
forced
a
way
through
its
somber
depths
were
as
we
have
seen
eager
but
the
cañon
was
known
and
traveled
as
a
pass
by
the
indians
and
mountain
animals
long
before
its
discovery
by
white
men
as
is
shown
by
the
numerous
tributary
trails
which
come
into
it
from
every
direction
its
name
accords
well
with
the
character
of
the
in
california
and
may
perhaps
have
been
suggested
by
the
predominant
color
of
the
metamorphic
slates
in
which
it
is
in
great
part
eroded
or
more
probably
by
made
by
the
unfortunate
animals
which
were
compelled
to
slip
and
shuffle
awkwardly
over
its
rough
cutting
rocks
i
have
never
known
an
animal
either
mule
or
horse
to
make
its
way
through
the
cañon
either
in
going
up
or
down
without
losing
more
or
less
blood
from
wounds
on
the
legs
occasionally
one
is
killed
headlong
and
rolling
over
precipices
like
a
boulder
but
such
accidents
are
rarer
than
from
the
terrible
appearance
of
the
trail
one
would
be
led
to
expect
the
more
experienced
when
driven
loose
find
their
way
over
the
dangerous
places
with
a
caution
and
sagacity
that
is
truly
wonderful
during
the
gold
excitement
it
was
at
times
a
matter
of
considerable
pecuniary
importance
to
force
a
way
through
the
cañon
with
early
in
the
spring
while
it
was
yet
heavily
blocked
with
snow
and
then
the
mules
with
their
loads
had
sometimes
to
be
let
down
over
the
steepest
drifts
and
avalanche
beds
by
means
of
ropes
a
good
leads
from
yosemite
through
many
a
grove
and
meadow
up
to
the
head
of
the
cañon
a
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
here
the
scenery
undergoes
a
sudden
and
startling
condensation
mountains
red
gray
and
black
rise
close
at
hand
on
the
right
whitened
around
their
bases
with
banks
of
enduring
snow
on
the
left
swells
the
huge
red
mass
of
mount
gibbs
while
in
front
the
eye
wanders
down
the
shadowy
cañon
and
out
on
the
warm
plain
of
mono
where
the
lake
is
seen
gleaming
like
a
burnished
metallic
disk
with
clusters
of
lofty
volcanic
cones
to
the
south
of
it
when
at
length
we
enter
the
mountain
gateway
the
somber
rocks
seem
aware
of
our
presence
and
seem
to
come
thronging
closer
about
us
happily
the
ouzel
and
the
old
familiar
robin
are
here
to
sing
us
welcome
and
azure
daisies
beam
with
trustfulness
and
sympathy
enabling
us
to
feel
something
of
love
even
here
beneath
the
gaze
of
her
coldest
rocks
the
effect
of
this
expressive
outspokenness
on
the
part
of
the
is
greatly
enhanced
by
the
quiet
aspect
of
the
alpine
meadows
through
which
we
pass
just
before
entering
the
narrow
gateway
the
forests
in
which
they
lie
and
the
rising
beyond
them
seem
quiet
and
tranquil
we
catch
their
restful
spirit
yield
to
the
soothing
influences
of
the
sunshine
and
saunter
dreamily
on
through
flowers
and
bees
scarce
touched
by
a
definite
thought
then
suddenly
we
find
ourselves
in
the
shadowy
cañon
closeted
with
nature
in
one
of
her
wildest
strongholds
after
the
first
bewildering
impression
begins
to
wear
off
we
perceive
that
it
is
not
altogether
terrible
for
besides
the
reassuring
birds
and
flowers
we
discover
a
chain
of
shining
lakelets
hanging
down
from
the
very
summit
of
the
pass
and
linked
together
by
a
silvery
stream
the
highest
are
set
in
bleak
rough
bowls
scantily
fringed
with
brown
and
yellow
sedges
winter
storms
blow
snow
through
the
cañon
in
blinding
drifts
and
avalanches
shoot
from
the
heights
then
are
these
sparkling
tarns
filled
and
buried
leaving
not
a
hint
of
their
existence
in
june
and
july
they
begin
to
blink
and
thaw
out
like
sleepy
eyes
the
carices
thrust
up
their
short
brown
spikes
the
daisies
bloom
in
turn
and
the
most
profoundly
buried
of
them
all
is
at
length
warmed
and
summered
as
if
winter
were
only
a
dream
red
lake
is
the
lowest
of
the
chain
and
also
the
largest
it
seems
rather
dull
and
forbidding
at
first
sight
lying
motionless
in
its
deep
dark
bed
the
cañon
wall
rises
sheer
from
the
edge
on
the
south
but
on
the
opposite
side
there
is
sufficient
space
and
sunshine
for
a
sedgy
daisy
garden
the
center
of
which
is
brilliantly
lighted
with
lilies
castilleias
larkspurs
and
columbines
sheltered
from
the
wind
by
leafy
willows
and
forming
a
most
joyful
outburst
of
keenly
emphasized
by
the
chill
baldness
of
the
onlooking
cliffs
after
indulging
here
in
a
dozing
shimmering
the
happy
stream
sets
forth
again
warbling
and
trilling
like
an
ouzel
ever
delightfully
confiding
no
matter
how
dark
the
way
leaping
gliding
hither
thither
clear
or
foaming
manifesting
the
beauty
of
its
wildness
in
every
sound
and
gesture
one
of
its
most
beautiful
developments
is
the
diamond
cascade
situated
a
short
distance
below
red
lake
here
the
tense
crystalline
water
is
first
dashed
into
coarse
granular
spray
mixed
with
dusty
foam
and
then
divided
into
a
diamond
pattern
by
following
the
diagonal
that
intersect
the
face
of
the
precipice
over
which
it
pours
viewed
in
front
it
resembles
a
strip
of
embroidery
of
definite
pattern
varying
through
the
seasons
with
the
temperature
and
the
volume
of
water
scarce
a
flower
may
be
seen
along
its
snowy
border
a
few
bent
pines
look
on
from
a
distance
and
small
fringes
of
cassiope
and
are
growing
in
fissures
near
the
head
but
these
are
so
lowly
and
undemonstrative
that
only
the
attentive
observer
will
be
likely
to
notice
them
on
the
north
wall
of
the
cañon
a
little
below
the
diamond
cascade
a
glittering
side
stream
makes
its
appearance
seeming
to
leap
directly
out
of
the
sky
it
first
resembles
a
crinkled
ribbon
of
silver
hanging
loosely
down
the
wall
but
grows
wider
as
it
descends
and
dashes
the
dull
rock
with
foam
a
long
rough
talus
curves
up
against
this
part
of
the
cliff
overgrown
with
willows
in
which
the
fall
disappears
with
many
an
eager
surge
and
swirl
and
plashing
leap
finally
beating
its
way
down
to
its
confluence

with

now
in
thoughtful
shade
falling
swirling
flashing
from
side
to
side
in
weariless
exuberance
of
energy
a
glorious
milky
way
of
cascades
is
thus
developed
of
which
bower
cascade
though
one
of
the
smallest
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
it
is
situated
in
the
lower
region
of
the
pass
just
where
the
sunshine
begins
to
mellow
between
the
cold
and
warm
climates
here
the
glad
creek
grown
strong
with
tribute
gathered
from
many
a
snowy
fountain
on
the
heights
sings
richer
strains
and
becomes
more
human
and
lovable
at
every
step
now
you
may
by
its
side
find
the
rose
and
homely
yarrow
and
small
meadows
full
of
bees
and
clover
at
the
head
of
a
rock
luxuriant
dogwood
bushes
and
willows
arch
over
from
bank
to
bank
embowering
the
stream
with
their
leafy
branches
and
drooping
plumes
kept
in
motion
by
the
current
fringe
the
brow
of
the
cascade
in
front
from
this
leafy
covert
the
stream
leaps
out
into
the
light
in
a
fluted
curve
thick
sown
with
sparkling
crystals
and
falls
into
a
pool
filled
with
brown
boulders
out
of
which
it
creeps
gray
with
and
disappears
in
a
tangle
of
verdure
like
that
from
which
it
came
hence
to
the
foot
of
the
cañon
the
metamorphic
slates
give
place
to
granite
whose
nobler
sculpture
calls
forth
expressions
of
corresponding
beauty
from
the
stream
in
passing
over
it
trills
of
rapids
booming
notes
of
falls
solemn
hushes
of
sheets
all
chanting
and
blending
in
glorious
harmony
when
at
length
its
impetuous
alpine
life
is
done
it
slips
through
a
meadow
with
scarce
an
audible
whisper
and
falls
asleep
in
moraine
lake
this
is
one
of
the
finest
i
ever
saw
evergreens
wave
soothingly
about
it
and
the
breath
of
flowers
floats
over
it
like
incense
here
our
blessed
stream
rests
from
its
rocky
wanderings
all
its
mountaineering
done
more
foaming
no
more
wild
exulting
song
it
falls
into
a
smooth
glassy
sleep
stirred
only
by
the
which
coming
down
the
cañon
makes
it
croon
and
mutter
in
ripples
along
its
broidered
shores
leaving
the
lake
it
glides
quietly
through
the
rushes
destined
never
more
to
touch
the
living
rock
henceforth
its
path
lies
through
ancient
moraines
and
reaches
of
ashy
which
nowhere
afford
rocks
suitable
for
the
development
of
cascades
or
sheer
falls
yet
this
beauty
of
maturity
though
less
striking
is
of
a
still
higher
order
enticing
us
lovingly
on
through
gentian
meadows
and
groves
of
rustling
aspen
to
lake
mono
where
our
happy
stream
vanishes
in
vapor
and
floats
free
again
in
the
sky
bloody
cañon
like
every
other
in
the
sierra
was
recently
occupied
by
a
glacier
which
derived
its
fountain
snows
from
the
adjacent
summits
and
descended
into
mono
lake
at
a
time
when
its
waters
stood
at
a
much
higher
level
than
now
the
principal
characters
in
which
the
history
of
the
ancient
glaciers
is
preserved
are
displayed
here
in
marvelous
freshness
and
simplicity
furnishing
the
student
with
extraordinary
advantages
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
of
this
sort
the
most
striking
passages
are
polished
and
striated
surfaces
which
in
many
places
reflect
the
rays
of
the
sun
like
smooth
water
the
dam
of
red
lake
is
an
elegantly
modeled
rib
of
metamorphic
slate
brought
into
relief
because
of
its
superior
strength
and
because
of
the
greater
intensity
of
the
glacial
erosion
of
the
rock
immediately
above
it
caused
by
a
steeply
inclined
tributary
glacier
which
entered
the
main
trunk
with
a
heavy
at
the
head
of
the
lake
moraine
lake
furnishes
an
equally
interesting
example
of
a
basin
formed
wholly
or
in
part
by
a
terminal
moraine
dam
curved
across
the
path
of
a
stream
between
two
lateral
moraines
at
moraine
lake
the
cañon
proper
terminates
although
apparently
continued
by
the
two
lateral
moraines
of
the
vanished
glacier
these
moraines
are
about
feet
high
and
extend
unbrokenly
from
the
sides
of
the
cañon
into
the
plain
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
curving
and
tapering
in
beautiful
lines
their
sunward
sides
are
gardens
their
shady
sides
are
groves
the
former
devoted
chiefly
to
eriogonae
compositae
and
graminae
a
square
rod
containing
five
or
six
profusely
flowered
eriogonums
of
several
species
about
the
same
number
of
bahia
and
linosyris
and
a
few
grass
tufts
each
species
being
planted
trimly
apart
with
bare
gravel
between
as
if
cultivated
artificially
my
first
visit
to
bloody
cañon
was
made
in
the
summer
of
under
circumstances
well
calculated
to
heighten
the
impressions
that
are
the
peculiar
offspring
of
mountains
i
came
from
the
blooming
tangles
of
florida
and
waded
out
into
the
of
the
great
valley
of
california
when
its
flora
was
as
yet
untrodden
never
before
had
i
beheld
congregations
of
social
flowers
half
so
extensive
or
half
so
glorious
golden
composite
covered
all
the
ground
from
the
coast
range
to
the
sierra
like
a
stratum
of
curdled
sunshine
in
which
i
reveled
for
weeks
watching
the
rising
and
setting
of
their
innumerable
suns
then
i
gave
myself
up
to
be
borne
forward
on
the
crest
of
the
summer
wave
that
sweeps
annually
up
the
sierra
and
spends
itself
on
the
snowy
summits
at
the
big
tuolumne
meadows
i
remained
more
than
a
month
sketching
botanizing
and
climbing
among
the
surrounding
mountains
the
mountaineer
with
whom
i
then
happened
to
be
camping
was
one
of
those
remarkable
men
one
so
frequently
meets
in
california
the
hard
angles
and
bosses
of
whose
characters
have
been
brought
into
relief
by
the
grinding
excitements
of
the
gold
period
until
they
resemble
glacial
landscapes
but
at
this
late
day
my
activities
had
subsided
and
his
craving
for
rest
caused
him
to
become
a
gentle
shepherd
and
literally
to
lie
down
with
the
lamb
recognizing
the
unsatisfiable
longings
of
my
scotch
highland
instincts
he
threw
out
some
hints
concerning
bloody
cañon
and
advised
me
to
explore
it
have
never
seen
it
myself
he
said
i
never
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
pass
that
way
but
i
have
heard
many
a
strange
story
about
it
and
i
warrant
you
will
at
least
find
it
wild
then
of
course
i
made
haste
to
see
it
early
next
morning
i
made
up
a
bundle
of
bread
tied
my
to
my
belt
and
strode
away
in
the
bracing
air
full
of
eager
indefinite
hope
the
plushy
lawns
that
lay
in
my
path
served
to
soothe
my
morning
haste
the
sod
in
many
places
was
starred
with
daisies
and
blue
gentians
over
which
i
lingered
i
traced
the
paths
of
the
ancient
glaciers
over
many
a
shining
pavement
and
marked
the
gaps
in
the
upper
forests
that
told
the
power
of
the
winter
avalanches
climbing
higher
i
saw
for
the
first
time
the
gradual
dwarfing
of
the
pines
in
compliance
with
climate
and
on
the
summit
discovered
creeping
mats
of
the
arctic
willow
overgrown
with
silky
catkins
and
patches
of
the
dwarf
vaccinium
with
its
round
flowers
sprinkled
in
the
grass
like
purple
hail
while
in
every
direction
the
landscape
stretched
sublimely
away
in
fresh
manuscript
written
by
the
hand
of
nature
alone
at
length
as
i
entered
the
pass
the
huge
rocks
began
to
close
around
in
all
their
wild
mysterious
impressiveness
when
suddenly
as
i
was
gazing
eagerly
about
me
a
drove
of
gray
hairy
beings
came
in
sight
lumbering
toward
me
with
a
kind
of
boneless
wallowing
motion
like
bears
i
never
turn
back
though
often
so
inclined
and
in
this
particular
instance
amid
such
surroundings
everything
seemed
singularly
unfavorable
for
the
calm
acceptance
of
so
grim
a
company
suppressing
my
fears
i
soon
discovered
that
although
as
hairy
as
bears
and
as
crooked
as
summit
pines
the
strange
creatures
were
sufficiently
erect
to
belong
to
our
own
species
they
proved
to
be
nothing
more
formidable
than
mono
indians
dressed
in
the
skins
of
both
the
men
and
the
women
begged
persistently
for
whisky
and
tobacco
and
seemed
so
accustomed
to
denials
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
convince
them
that
i
had
none
to
give
excepting
the
names
of
these
two
products
of
civilization
they
seemed
to
understand
not
a
word
of
english
but
i
afterward
learned
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
yosemite
valley
to
feast
awhile
on
trout
and
procure
a
load
of
acorns
to
carry
back
through
the
pass
to
their
huts
on
the
shore
of
mono
lake
occasionally
a
good
countenance
may
be
seen
among
the
mono
indians
but
these
the
first
specimens
i
had
seen
were
mostly
ugly
and
some
of
them
altogether
hideous
the
dirt
on
their
faces
was
fairly
stratified
and
seemed
so
ancient
and
so
undisturbed
it
might
almost
possess
a
geological
significance
the
older
faces
were
moreover
strangely
blurred
and
divided
into
sections
by
furrows
that
looked
like
the
of
rocks
suggesting
exposure
on
the
mountains
in
a
castaway
condition
for
ages
somehow
they
seemed
to
have
no
right
place
in
the
landscape
and
i
was
glad
to
see
them
fading
out
of
sight
down
the
pass
then
came
evening
and
the
somber
cliffs
were
inspired
with
the
ineffable
beauty
of
the
alpenglow
a
solemn
calm
fell
upon
everything
all
the
lower
portion
of
the
cañon
was
in
gloaming
shadow
and
i
crept
into
a
hollow
near
one
of
the
upper
lakelets
to
smooth
the
ground
in
a
sheltered
nook
for
a
bed
when
the
short
twilight
faded
i
kindled
a
sunny
fire
made
a
cup
of
tea
and
lay
down
to
rest
and
look
at
the
stars
soon
the
began
to
flow
and
pour
in
torrents
among
the
jagged
peaks
mingling
strange
tones
with
those
of
the
waterfalls
sounding
far
below
and
as
i
drifted
toward
sleep
i
began
to
experience
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
nearness
to
the
furred
monos
then
the
full
moon
looked
down
over
the
edge
of
the
cañon
wall
her
countenance
seemingly
filled
with
intense
concern
and
apparently
so
near
as
to
produce
a
startling
effect
as
if
she
had
entered
my
bedroom
forgetting
all
the
world
to
gaze
on
me
alone
the
night
was
full
of
strange
sounds
and
i
gladly
welcomed
the
morning
breakfast
was
soon
done
and
i
set
forth
in
the
exhilarating
freshness
of
the
new
day
rejoicing
in
the
abundance
of
pure
wildness
so
close
about
me
the
stupendous
rocks
hacked
and
scarred
with
centuries
of
storms
stood
sharply
out
in
the
thin
early
light
while
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
grooved
and
polished
bosses
heaved
and
glistened
like
swelling
telling
a
grand
old
story
of
the
ancient
glacier
that
poured
its
crushing
floods
above
them
here
for
the
first
time
i
met
the
arctic
daisies
in
all
their
perfection
of
purity
and
spirituality
mountaineers
face
to
face
with
the
stormy
sky
kept
safe
and
warm
by
a
thousand
miracles
i
leaped
lightly
from
rock
to
rock
glorying
in
the
eternal
freshness
and
sufficiency
of
nature
and
in
the
ineffable
tenderness
with
which
she
nurtures
her
mountain
darlings
in
the
very
fountains
of
storms
fresh
beauty
appeared
at
every
step
delicate
and
groups
of
the
fairest
flowers
now
another
lake
came
to
view
now
a
waterfall
never
fell
light
in
brighter
spangles
never
fell
water
in
whiter
foam
i
seemed
to
float
through
the
cañon
enchanted
feeling
nothing
of
its
roughness
and
was
out
in
the
mono
levels
before
i
was
aware
looking
back
from
the
shore
of
moraine
lake
my
morning
ramble
seemed
all
a
dream
there
curved
bloody
cañon
a
mere
glacial
furrow
feet
deep
with
smooth
rocks
projecting
from
the
sides
and
braided
together
in
the
middle
like
bulging
swelling
muscles
here
the
lilies
were
higher
than
my
head
and
the
sunshine
was
warm
enough
for
palms
yet
the
snow
around
the
arctic
willows
was
plainly
visible
only
four
miles
away
and
between
were
narrow
specimen
zones
of
all
the
principal
climates
of
the
globe
on
the
bank
of
a
small
brook
that
comes
gurgling
down
the
side
of
the
left
lateral
moraine
i
found
a
still
burning
which
no
doubt
belonged
to
the
gray
indians
i
had
met
on
the
summit
and
i
listened
instinctively
and
moved
cautiously
forward
half
expecting
to
see
some
of
their
grim
faces
peering
out
of
the
bushes
passing
on
toward
the
open
plain
i
noticed
three
terminal
moraines
curved
gracefully
across
the
cañon
stream
and
joined
by
long
splices
to
the
two
noble
laterals
these
mark
the
of
the
vanished
glacier
when
it
was
retreating
into
its
summit
shadows
on
the
of
the
glacial
winter
five
miles
below
the
foot
of
moraine
lake
just
where
the
lateral
moraines
lose
themselves
in
the
plain
there
was
a
field
of
wild
rye
growing
in
magnificent
waving
bunches
six
to
eight
feet
high
bearing
heads
from
six
to
twelve
inches
long
rubbing
out
some
of
the
grains
i
found
them
about
five
eighths
of
an
inch
long
and
sweet
indian
women
were
gathering
it
in
baskets
bending
down
large
handfuls
beating
it
out
and
fanning
it
in
the
wind
they
were
quite
picturesque
coming
through
the
rye
as
one
caught
glimpses
of
them
here
and
there
in
winding
lanes
and
openings
with
splendid
tufts
arching
above
their
heads
while
their
incessant
chat
and
laughter
showed
their
heedless
joy
like
the
i
found
the
desert
of
mono
blooming
in
a
high
state
of
natural
cultivation
with
the
wild
rose
cherry
aster
and
the
delicate
abronia
also
innumerable
gilias
phloxes
poppies
and
i
observed
their
gestures
and
the
various
expressions
of
their
corollas
inquiring
how
they
could
be
so
fresh
and
beautiful
out
in
this
volcanic
desert
they
told
as
happy
a
life
as
any
i
ever
met
and
seemed
to
enjoy
even
the
hot
sand
and
the
wind
but
the
vegetation
of
the
pass
has
been
in
great
part
destroyed
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
the
more
accessible
passes
throughout
the
range
immense
numbers
of
starving
sheep
and
cattle
have
been
driven
through
them
into
nevada
trampling
the
wild
gardens
and
meadows
almost
out
of
existence
the
lofty
walls
are
untouched
by
any
foot
and
the
falls
sing
on
unchanged
but
the
sight
of
crushed
flowers
and
stripped
bitten
bushes
goes
far
toward
destroying
the
charm
of
wildness
the
cañon
should
be
seen
in
winter
a
good
strong
traveler
who
knows
the
way
and
the
weather
might
easily
make
a
safe
excursion
through
it
from
yosemite
valley
on
during
some
tranquil
time
when
the
storms
are
hushed
the
lakes
and
falls
would
be
buried
then
but
so
also
would
be
the
traces
of
destructive
feet
while
the
views
of
the
mountains
in
their
winter
garb
and
the
ride
at
lightning
speed
down
the
pass
between
the
snowy
walls
would
be
truly
glorious
illustration
view
of
the
mono
plain
from
the
foot
of
bloody
cañon
chapter
vi
the
glacier
lakes
among
the
many
treasures
that
are
bound
up
and
hidden
away
in
the
depths
of
sierra
solitudes
none
more
surely
charm
and
surprise
all
kinds
of
travelers
than
the
glacier
lakes
the
forests
and
the
glaciers
and
the
snowy
fountains
of
the
streams
advertise
their
wealth
in
a
more
or
less
telling
manner
even
in
the
distance
but
nothing
is
seen
of
the
lakes
until
we
have
climbed
above
them
all
the
upper
branches
of
the
rivers
are
fairly
laden
with
lakes
like
orchard
trees
with
fruit
they
lie
embosomed
in
the
deep
woods
down
in
the
grovy
bottoms
of
cañons
high
on
bald
tablelands
and
around
the
feet
of
the
icy
peaks
mirroring
back
their
wild
beauty
over
and
over
again
some
conception
of
their
lavish
abundance
may
be
made
from
the
fact
that
from
one
standpoint
on
the
summit
of
red
mountain
a
journey
to
the
east
of
yosemite
valley
no
fewer
than
are
displayed
within
a
radius
of
ten
miles
the
whole
number
in
the
sierra
can
hardly
be
less
than
fifteen
hundred
not
counting
the
smaller
pools
and
tarns
which
are
innumerable
perhaps
two
thirds
or
more
lie
on
the
western
flank
of
the
range
and
all
are
restricted
to
the
alpine
and
subalpine
regions
at
the
close
of
the
last
glacial
period
the
middle
and
regions
also
abounded
in
lakes
all
of
which
have
long
since
vanished
as
completely
as
the
magnificent
ancient
glaciers
that
brought
them
into
existence
though
the
eastern
flank
of
the
range
is
excessively
steep
we
find
lakes
pretty
regularly
distributed
throughout
even
the
most
precipitous
portions
they
are
mostly
found
in
the
upper
branches
of
the
cañons
and
in
the
glacial
amphitheaters
around
the
peaks
occasionally
long
narrow
specimens
occur
upon
the
steep
sides
of
dividing
ridges
their
basins
swung
lengthwise
like
hammocks
and
very
rarely
one
is
found
lying
so
exactly
on
the
summit
of
the
range
at
the
head
of
some
pass
that
its
waters
are
discharged
down
both
flanks
when
the
snow
is
melting
fast
but
however
situated
they
soon
cease
to
form
surprises
to
the
studious
mountaineer
for
like
all
the
of
nature
they
are
harmoniously
related
to
one
another
and
to
all
the
other
features
of
the
mountains
it
is
easy
therefore
to
find
the
bright
in
the
roughest
and
most
topography
of
any
landscape
countenance
even
in
the
lower
regions
where
they
have
been
closed
for
many
a
century
their
rocky
orbits
are
still
discernible
filled
in
with
the
detritus
of
flood
and
avalanche
a
beautiful
system
of
grouping
in
correspondence
with
the
glacial
fountains
is
soon
perceived
also
their
extension
in
the
direction
of
the
trends
of
the
ancient
glaciers
and
in
general
their
dependence
as
to
form
size
and
position
upon
the
character
of
the
rocks
in
which
their
basins
have
been
eroded
and
the
quantity
and
direction
of
application
of
the
glacial
force
expended
upon
each
basin
in
the
upper
cañons
we
usually
find
them
in
pretty
regular
succession
strung
together
like
beads
on
the
bright
ribbons
of
their
which
pour
white
and
gray
with
foam
and
spray
from
one
to
the
other
their
perfect
mirror

making
impressive
contrasts
with
the
grand
blare
and
glare
of
the

cataracts

the

of
the

immediately
above

are

lying
near
together
in

from

me

its

go

that

there
is
no
marked
dividing

as

in

therefore
to
prevent
confusion
i
would
state
here
that

beyond

of

after

the

out
with

contracting
its

while
the

deposited

cause
it

at

the

of

forever
in

age
and
now

on
without
halting
through
the
new
gardens
and
groves
that
have
taken
its
place
the
length
of
the
life
of
any
lake
depends
ordinarily
upon
the
capacity
of
its
basin
as
compared
with
the
carrying
power
of
the
streams
that
flow
into
it
the
character
of
the
rocks
over
which
these
streams
flow
and
the
relative
position
of
the
lake
toward
other
lakes
in
a
series
whose
basins
lie
in
the
same
cañon
and
are
fed
by
one
and
the
same
main
stream
the
uppermost
will
of
course
vanish
first
unless
some
other
agent
comes
in
to
modify
the
result
because
at
first
it
receives
nearly
all
of
the
sediments
that
the
stream
brings
down
only
the
finest
of
the
being
carried
through
the
highest
of
the
series
to
the
next
below
then
the
next
higher
and
the
next
would
be
successively
filled
and
the
lowest
would
be
the
last
to
vanish
but
this
simplicity
as
to
duration
is
broken
in
upon
in
various
ways
chiefly
through
the
action
of
that
enter
the
lower
lakes
direct
for
notwithstanding
many
of
these
side
tributaries
are
quite
short
and
during
late
summer
feeble
they
all
become
powerful
torrents
in
springtime
when
the
snow
is
melting
and
carry
not
only
sand
and
but
large
trunks
and
boulders
tons
in
weight
sweeping
them
down
their
steeply
inclined
channels
and
into
the
lake
basins
with
astounding
energy
many
of
these
side
affluents
also
have
the
advantage
of
access
to
the
main
lateral
moraines
of
the
vanished
glacier
that
occupied
the
cañon
and
upon
these
they
draw
for
material
while
the
main
trunk
stream
flows
mostly
over
clean
glacier
pavements
where
but
little
moraine
matter
is
ever
left
for
them
to
carry
thus
a
small
rapid
stream
with
abundance
of
loose
transportable
material
within
its
reach
may
fill
up
an
extensive
basin
in
a
few
centuries
while
a
large
perennial
trunk
stream
flowing
over
clean
enduring
pavements
though
ordinarily
a
hundred
times
larger
may
not
fill
a
smaller
basin
in
thousands
of
years
the
comparative
influence
of
great
and
small
streams
as
is
strikingly
illustrated
in
yosemite
valley
through
which
the
merced
flows
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
now
composed
of
level
and
dry
sloping
planted
with
oak
and
pine
but
it
was
once
a
lake
stretching
from
wall
to
wall
and
nearly
from
one
end
of
the
valley
to
the
other
forming
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sheets
of
water
that
ever
existed
in
the
sierra
and
though
never
perhaps
seen
by
human
eye
it
was
but
yesterday
geologically
speaking
since
it
disappeared
and
the
traces
of
its
existence
are
still
so
fresh
it
may
easily
be
restored
to
the
eye
of
imagination
and
viewed
in
all
its
grandeur
about
as
truly
and
vividly
as
if
actually
before
us
now
we
find
that
the
detritus
which
fills
this
magnificent
basin
was
not
brought
down
from
the
distant
mountains
by
the
main
streams
that
converge
here
to
form
the
river
however
powerful
and
available
for
the
purpose
at
first
sight
they
appear
but
almost
wholly
by
the
small
local
tributaries
such
as
those
of
indian
cañon
the
sentinel
and
the
three
brothers
and
by
a
few
small
residual
glaciers
which
lingered
in
the
shadows
of
the
walls
long
after
the
main
trunk
glacier
had
receded
beyond
the
head
of
the
valley
had
the
glaciers
that
once
covered
the
range
been
melted
at
once
leaving
the
entire
surface
bare
from
top
to
bottom
simultaneously
then
of
course
all
the
lakes
would
have
come
into
existence
at
the
same
time
and
the
highest
other
circumstances
being
equal
would
as
we
have
seen
be
the
first
to
vanish
but
because
they
melted
gradually
from
the
foot
of
the
range
upward
the
lower
lakes
were
the
first
to
see
the
light
and
the
first
to
be
obliterated
therefore
instead
of
finding
the
lakes
of
the
present
day
at
the
foot
of
the
range
we
find
them
at
the
top
most
of
the
lower
lakes
vanished
thousands
of
years
before
those
now
brightening
the
alpine
landscapes
were
born
and
in
general
owing
to
the
deliberation
of
the
upward
retreat
of
the
glaciers
the
lowest
of
the
existing
lakes
are
also
the
oldest
a
gradual
transition
being
apparent
throughout
the
entire
belt
from
the
older
forested
and
contracted
forms
all
the
way
up
to
those
that
are
new
born
lying
bare
and
meadowless
among
the
highest
peaks
illustration
the
death
of
a
lake
a
few
small
lakes
unfortunately
situated
are
extinguished
suddenly
by
a
single
swoop
of
an
avalanche
carrying
down
immense
numbers
of
trees
together
with
the
soil
they
were
growing
upon
others
are
obliterated
by
earthquake
taluses
but
these
compared
with
those
resulting
from
the
deliberate
and
incessant
deposition
of
sediments
may
be
termed
accidental
their
fate
is
like
that
of
trees
struck
by
lightning
the
is
of
course
still
rising
its
present
elevation
being
about
feet
above
somewhat
higher
than
this
toward
the
southern
extremity
of
the
range
lower
toward
the
northern
on
account
of
the
difference
in
time
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
glaciers
due
to
difference
in
climate
specimens
occur
here
and
there
considerably
below
this
limit
in
basins
specially
protected
from
inwashing
detritus
or
exceptional
in
size
these
however
are
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
make
any
marked
irregularity
in
the
line
the
highest
i
have
yet
found
lies
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
in
a
glacier
womb
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
highest
of
the
summit
peaks
a
few
miles
to
the
north
of
mount
hitter
the
basins
of
perhaps
or
thirty
are
still
in
process
of
formation
beneath
the
few
lingering
glaciers
but
by
the
time
they
are
born
an
equal
or
greater
number
will
probably
have
died
since
the
beginning
of
the
close
of
the
the
whole
number
in
the
range
has
perhaps
never
been
greater
than
at
present
a
rough
approximation
to
the
average
duration
of
these
mountain
lakes
may
be
made
from
data
already
suggested
but
i
can
not
stop
here
to
present
the
subject
in
detail
i
must
also
forego
in
the
mean
time
the
pleasure
of
a
full
discussion
of
the
interesting
question
of
formation
for
which
fine
clear
demonstrative
material
abounds
in
these
mountains
in
addition
to
what
has
been
already
given
on
the
subject
i
will
only
make
this
one
statement
every
lake
in
the
sierra
is
a
glacier
lake
their
basins
were
not
merely
remodeled
and
scoured
out
by
this
mighty
agent
but
in
the
first
place
were
eroded
from
the
solid
i
must
now
make
haste
to
give
some
nearer
views
of
representative
specimens
lying
at
different
elevations
on
the
main
confining
myself
to
descriptions
of
the
features
most
characteristic
of
each
shadow
lake
this
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
oldest
and
lowest
of
the
existing
lakes
it
lies
about
eight
miles
above
yosemite
valley
on
the
main
branch
of
the
merced
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
above
the
sea
and
is
everywhere
so
securely
that
without
artificial
trails
only
wild
animals
can
get
down
to
its
rocky
shores
from
any
direction
its
original
length
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
now
it
is
only
half
a
mile
in
length
by
about
a
fourth
of
a
mile
in
width
and
over
the
lowest
portion
of
the
basin
feet
deep
its
crystal
waters
are
clasped
around
on
the
north
and
south
by
majestic
granite
walls
sculptured
in
true
yosemitic
style
into
domes
gables
and
battlemented
headlands
which
on
the
south
come
plunging
down
sheer
into
deep
water
from
a
height
of
from
to
feet
the
south
lyell
glacier
eroded
this
magnificent
basin
out
of
solid
porphyritic
granite
while
forcing
its
way
westward
from
the
summit
fountains
toward
yosemite
and
the
exposed
rocks
around
the
shores
and
the
projecting
bosses
of
the
walls
ground
and
burnished
beneath
the
vast
still
glow
with
silvery
radiance
notwithstanding
the
innumerable
corroding
storms
that
have
fallen
upon
them
the
general
conformation
of
the
basin
as
well
as
the
moraines
laid
along
the
top
of
the
walls
and
the
grooves
and
scratches
on
the
bottom
and

in
the
autumn
of
while
on
my
way
to

at
the

was
rejoicing
then
in
its
gayest
colors
untrodden
hidden
in
the
glorious
wildness
like
unmined
gold
year
after
year
i
walked
its
shores
without
discovering
any
other
trace
of
humanity
than
the
remains
of
an
indian
and
the
of
a
deer
that
had
been
broken
to
get
at
the
marrow
it
lies
out
of
the
regular
ways
of
indians
who
love
to
hunt
in
more
accessible
fields
adjacent
to
trails
their
knowledge
of
had
probably
enticed
them
here
some
when
they
wished
to
make
sure
of
a
feast
for
hunting
in
this
is
like
hunting
in
a
fenced
park
i
had
told
the
beauty
of
shadow
lake
only
to
a
few
friends
fearing
it
might
come
to
be
trampled
and
like
yosemite
on
my
last
visit
as
i
was
sauntering
along
the
shore
on
the
strip
of
sand
between
the
water
and
sod
reading
the
tracks
of
the
wild
animals
that
live
here
i
was
startled
by
a
human
track
which
i
at
once
saw
belonged
to
some
shepherd
for
each
step
was
turned
out
or
from
the
general
course
pursued
and
was
also
run
over
in
an
uncertain
sprawling
fashion
at
the
heel
while
a
row
of
round
dots
on
the
right
indicated
the
staff
that
shepherds
carry
none
but
a
shepherd
could
make
such
a
track
and
after
tracing
it
a
few
minutes
i
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
seeking
pasturage
for
what
else
could
he
be
seeking
returning
from
the
glaciers
shortly
afterward
nay
worst
fears
were
realized
a
trail
had
been
made
down
the
from
the
north
and
all
the
gardens
and
meadows
were
destroyed
by
a
horde
of
hoofed
locusts
as
if
swept
by
a
fire

were
in
the
temple
orange
lake
besides
these
larger
cañon
lakes
fed
by
the
main
cañon
streams
there
are
many
smaller
ones
lying
aloft
on
the
top
of
rock
benches
entirely
independent
of
the
general
drainage
channels
and
of
course
drawing
their
supplies
from
a
very
limited
area
notwithstanding
they
are
mostly
small
and
shallow
owing
to
their
immunity
from
avalanche
detritus
and
the
inwashings
of
powerful
streams
they
often
endure
longer
than
others
many
times
larger
but
less
favorably
situated
when
very
shallow
they
become
dry
toward
the
end
of
summer
but
because
their
basins
are
ground
out
of
seamless
stone
they
suffer
no
loss
save
from
evaporation
alone
and
the
great
depth
of
snow
that
falls
lasting
into
june
makes
their
dry
season
short

any
case

vertical

can
not
stop
here
to
explain
the
cliffs
about
these
lakes
are
seldom
of
the
massive
yosemite
type
but
are
more
broken
and
less
sheer
and
they
usually
stand
back
leaving
the
shores
comparatively
free
while
the
few
precipitous
rocks
that
do
come
forward
and
plunge
directly
into
deep
water
are
seldom
more
than
three
or
four
hundred
feet
high
i
have
never
yet
met
ducks
in
any
of
the
lakes
of
this
kind
but
the
ouzel
is
never
wanting
where
the
are
perennial
wild
sheep
and
deer
may
occasionally
be
seen
on
the
meadows
and
very
rarely
a
bear
one
might
camp
on
the
rugged
shores
of
these
bright
fountains
for
weeks
without
meeting
any
animal
larger
than
the
marmots
that
burrow
beneath
glacier
boulders
along
the
edges
of
the
meadows
the
highest
and
youngest
of
all
the
lakes
lie
nestled
in
glacier
wombs
at
first
sight
they
seem
pictures
of
pure
bloodless
desolation
miniature
arctic
seas
bound
in
perpetual
ice
and
snow
and
overshadowed
by
harsh
gloomy
crumbling
precipices
their
waters
are
keen
ultramarine
blue
in
the
deepest
parts
lively
toward
the
shore
shallows
and
around
the
edges
of
the
small
bergs
usually
floating
about
in
them
a
few
hardy
sedges
every
night
are
occasionally
found
making
soft
sods
along
the
portions
of
their
shores
and
when
their
northern
banks
slope
openly
to
the
south
and
are
no
matter
how
coarsely
they
are
sure
to
be
brightened
with
flowers
one
lake
in
particular
now
comes
to
mind
which
illustrates
the
floweriness
of
the
banks
of
these
icy
gems
close
up
under
the
shadow
of
the
sierra
matterhorn
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
range
lies
one
of
the
iciest
of
these
glacier
lakes
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
a
short
glacier
crawls
into
it
from
the
south
and
on
the
opposite
side
it
is
embanked
and
dammed
by
a
series
of
concentric
terminal
moraines
made
by
the
glacier
when
it
entirely
filled
the
basin
half
a
mile
below
lies
a
second
lake
at
a
height
of
feet
about
as
cold
and
as
pure
as
a
the
waters
of
the
first
come
gurgling
down
into
it
over
and
through
the
moraine
dam
while
a
second
stream
pours
into
it
direct
from
a
glacier
that
lies
to
the
southeast
sheer
precipices
of
crystalline
snow
rise
out
of
deep
water
on
the
south
keeping
perpetual
winter
on
that
side
but
there
is
a
fine
summery
spot
on
the
other
notwithstanding
the
lake
is
only
about
yards
wide
here
on
august
i
found
a
charming
company
of
flowers
not
pinched
crouching
dwarfs
scarce
able
to
look
up
but
warm
and
juicy
standing
erect
in
rich
cheery
color
and
bloom
on
a
narrow
strip
of
shingle
close
to
the
edge
there
were
a
few
tufts
of
carex
gone
to
seed
and
a
little
way
back
up
the
rocky
bank
at
the
foot
of
a
crumbling
wall
so
inclined
as
to
absorb
and
radiate
as
well
as
reflect
a
considerable
quantity
of
was
the
garden
containing
a
thrifty
thicket
of
cowania
covered
with
large
yellow
flowers
several
bushes
of
the
alpine
ribes
with
berries
nearly
ripe
and
wildly
acid
a
few
handsome
grasses
belonging
to
two
distinct
species
and
one
goldenrod
a
few
hairy
lupines
and
radiant
spragueas
whose
blue
and
flowers
were
set
off
to
fine
advantage
amid
green
carices
and
along
a
narrow
seam
in
the
very
warmest
angle
of
the
wall
a
perfectly
gorgeous
fringe
of
with
flowers
an
inch
wide
crowded
together
in
lavish
profusion
and
colored
as
royal
a
purple
as
ever
was
worn
by
any
plant
of
the
tropics
and
best
of
all
and
greatest
of
all
a
noble
thistle
in
full
bloom
standing
erect
head
and
shoulders
above
his
companions
and
thrusting
out
his
lances
in
sturdy
vigor
as
if
growing
on
a
scottish
brae
all
this
brave
warm
bloom
among
the
raw
stones
right
in
the
face
of
the
onlooking
glaciers
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
these
upper
lakes
are
in
winter
to
a
depth
of
about
or
forty
feet
and
those
most
exposed
to
avalanches
to
a
depth
of
even
a
hundred
feet
or
more
these
last
are
of
course
nearly
lost
to
the
landscape
some
remain
buried
for
years
when
the
snowfall
is
exceptionally
great
and
many
open
only
on
one
side
late
in
the
season
the
snow
of
the
closed
side
is
composed
of
coarse
granules
compacted
and
frozen
into
a
firm
faintly
stratified
mass
like
the
of
a
glacier
the
lapping
waves
of
the
open
portion
gradually
undermine
and
cause
it
to
break
off
in
large
masses
like
icebergs
which
gives
rise
to
a
precipitous
front
like
the
discharging
wall
of
a
glacier
entering
the
sea
the
play
of
the
lights
among
the
crystal
angles
of
these
the
pearly
white
of
the
outswelling
bosses
the
bergs
drifting
in
front
aglow
in
the
sun
and
edged
with
green
water
and
the
deep
blue
disk
of
the
lake
itself
extending
to
your
feet
forms
a
picture
that
enriches
all
your
afterlife
and
is
never
forgotten
but
however
perfect
the
season
and
the
day
the
cold
incompleteness
of
these
young
lakes
is
always
keenly
felt
we
approach
them
with
a
kind
of
mean
caution
and
steal
unconfidingly
around
their
crystal
shores
dashed
and
ill
at
ease
as
if
expecting
to
hear
some
forbidding
voice
but
the
of
the
ouzels
and
the
of
the
daisies
gradually
reassure
us
and
manifest
the
warm
fountain
humanity
that
pervades
the
coldest
and
most
solitary
of
them
all
chapter
vii
the
glacier
meadows
after
the
lakes
on
the
high
sierra
come
the
glacier
meadows
they
are
smooth
level
silky
lawns
lying
embedded
in
the
upper
forests
on
the
floors
of
the
valleys
and
along
the
broad
backs
of
the
main
dividing
ridges
at
a
height
of
about
to
feet
above
the
sea
they
are
nearly
as
level
as
the
lakes
whose
places
they
have
taken
and
present
a
dry
even
surface
free
from
mossy
bogginess
and
the
frowsy
roughness
of
rank
weedy
and
shrubby
vegetation
the
sod
is
close
and
fine
and
so
complete
that
you
can
not
see
the
ground
and
at
the
same
time
so
brightly
enameled
with
flowers
and
butterflies
that
it
may
well
be
called
a
or
for
the
plushy
sod
is
in
many
places
so
crowded
with
gentians
daisies
ivesias
and
various
species
of
orthocarpus
that
the
grass
is
scarcely
noticeable
while
in
others
the
flowers
are
only
pricked
in
here
and
there
singly
or
in
small
ornamental
rosettes
the
most
influential
of
the
grasses
composing
the
sod
is
a
delicate
calamagrostis
with
fine
filiform
leaves
and
loose
airy
panicles
that
seem
to
float
above
the
flowery
lawn
like
a
purple
mist
but
write
as
i
may
i
can
not
give
anything
like
an
adequate
idea
of
the
exquisite
beauty
of
these
mountain
carpets
as
they
lie
smoothly
outspread
in
the
savage
wilderness
what
words
are
fine
enough
to
picture
them
i
to
what
shall
we
liken
them
the
flowery
levels
of
the
prairies
of
the
old
west
the
luxuriant
savannahs
of
the
south
and
the
finest
of
cultivated
meadows
are
coarse
in
comparison
one
may
at
first
sight
compare
them
with
the
carefully
tended
lawns
of
for
they
are
as
free
from
weeds
as
they
and
as
smooth
but
here
the
likeness
ends
for
these
wild
lawns
with
all
their
exquisite
fineness
have
no
trace
of
that
painful
licked
snipped
repressed
appearance
that
lawns
are
apt
to
have
even
when
viewed
at
a
distance
and
not
to
mention
the
flowers
with
which
they
are
brightened
their
grasses
are
very
much
finer
both
in
color
and
texture
and
instead
of
lying
flat
and
motionless
matted
together
like
a
dead
green
cloth
they
respond
to
the
touches
of
every
breeze
rejoicing
in
pure
wildness
blooming
and
fruiting
in
the
vital
light
glacier
meadows
abound
throughout
all
the
alpine
and
subalpine
regions
of
the
sierra
in
still
greater
numbers
than
the
lakes
probably
from
to
exist
between
latitude
and
distributed
of
course
like
the
lakes
in
concordance
with
all
the
other
glacial
features
of
the
landscape
on
the
head
waters
of
the
rivers
there
are
what
are
called
meadows
usually
about
from
five
to
ten
miles
long
these
occupy
the
basins
of
the
ancient
where
many
tributary
glaciers
came
together
to
form
the
grand
trunks
most
however
are
quite
small
averaging
perhaps
but
little
more
than
three
fourths
of
a
mile
in
length
one
of
the
very
finest
of
the
thousands
i
have
enjoyed
lies
hidden
in
an
extensive
forest
of
the
pine
on
the
edge
of
the
basin
of
the
ancient
tuolumne
mer
de
glace
about
eight
miles
to
the
west
of
mount
dana
imagine
yourself
at
the
tuolumne
soda
springs
on
the
bank
of
the
river
a
journey
above
yosemite
valley
you
set
off
northward
through
a
forest
that
stretches
away
indefinitely
before
you
seemingly
unbroken
by
openings
of
any
kind
as
soon
as
you
are
fairly
into
the
woods
the
gray
with
their
snowy
gorges
and
hollows
are
lost
to
view
the
ground
is
littered
with
fallen
trunks
that
lie
crossed
and
recrossed
like
wheat
and
besides
this
close
forest
of
pines
the
rich
moraine
soil
supports
a
luxuriant
growth
of
triticum
calamagrostis
agrostis
which
rear
their
handsome
spikes
and
panicles
above
your
waist
making
your
way
through
the
fertile
wilderness
lively
bits
of
interest
now
and
then
in
the
squirrels
and
clark
crows
and
perchance
in
a
deer
or
bear
the
lapse
of
an
hour
or
two
vertical
bars
of
sunshine
are
seen
ahead
between
the
brown
shafts
of
the
pines
showing
that
you
are
approaching
an
open
space
and
then
you
suddenly
emerge
from
the
forest
shadows
upon
a
delightful
purple
lawn
lying
smooth
and
free
in
the
light
like
a
lake
this
is
a
glacier
meadow
it
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
long
by
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
the
trees
come
pressing
forward
all
around
in
close
serried
ranks
planting
their
feet
exactly
on
its
margin
and
holding
themselves
erect
strict
and
orderly
like
soldiers
on
parade
thus
bounding
the
meadow
with
exquisite
precision
yet
with
free
curving
lines
such
as
nature
alone
can
draw
with
inexpressible
delight
you
wade
out
into
the
grassy
feeling
yourself
contained
in
one
of
most
sacred
chambers
withdrawn
from
the
sterner
influences
of
the
mountains
secure
from
all
intrusion
secure
from
yourself
free
in
the
universal
beauty
and
notwithstanding
the
scene
is
so
impressively
spiritual
and
you
seem
dissolved
in
it
yet
everything
about
you
is
beating
with
warm
terrestrial
human
love
and
life
delightfully
substantial
and
familiar
the
resiny
pines
are
types
of
health
and
steadfastness
the
robins
feeding
on
the
sod
belong
to
the
same
species
you
have
known
since
childhood
and
surely
these
daisies
larkspurs
and
goldenrods
are
the
very
of
the
old
home
garden
bees
hum
as
in
a
harvest
noon
butterflies
waver
above
the
flowers
and
like
them
you
lave
in
the
vital
sunshine
too
richly
and
homogeneously
to
be
capable
of
partial
thought
you
are
all
eye
sifted
through
and
through
with
light
and
beauty
sauntering
along
the
brook
that
meanders
silently
through
the
meadow
from
the
east
special
flowers
call
you
back
to
discriminating
consciousness
the
sod
comes
curving
down
to
the
edge
forming
bossy
outswelling
banks
and
in
some
places
overlapping
countersunk
boulders
and
forming
bridges
here
you
find
mats
of
the
curious
dwarf
willow
scarce
an
inch
high
yet
sending
up
a
multitude
of
gray
silky
catkins
illumined
here
and
there
with
the
purple
cups
and
bells
of
bryanthus
and
vaccinium
go
where
you
may
you
everywhere
find
the
lawn
divinely
beautiful
as
if
nature
had
fingered
and
adjusted
every
plant
this
very
day
the
floating
grass
panicles
are
scarcely
felt
in
brushing
through
their
midst
so
flue
are
they
and
none
of
the
flowers
have
tall
or
rigid
stalks
in
the
brightest
places
you
find
three
species
of
gentians
with
different
shades
of
blue
daisies
pure
as
the
sky
silky
leaved
ivesias
with
warm
yellow
flowers
several
species
of
orthocarpus
with
blunt
bossy
spikes
red
and
purple
and
yellow
the
alpine
goldenrod
pentstemon
and
clover
fragrant
and
honeyful
with
their
colors
massed
and
blended
parting
the
grasses
and
looking
more
closely
you
may
trace
the
branching
of
their
shining
stems
and
note
the
marvelous
beauty
of
their
mist
of
flowers
the
glumes
and
pales
exquisitely
penciled
the
yellow
dangling
stamens
and
feathery
pistils
beneath
the
lowest
leaves
you
discover
a
fairy
realm
of
mosses
dicranum
polytriclium
and
many
others
precious
poised
daintily
on
polished
shafts
curiously
hooded
or
open
showing
the
richly
ornate
peristomas
worn
like
royal
crowns
creeping
liverworts
are
here
also
in
abundance
and
several
rare
species
of
fungi
exceedingly
small
and
frail
and
delicate
as
if
made
only
for
beauty
caterpillars
black
beetles
and
ants
roam
the
wilds
of
this
lower
world
making
their
way
through
miniature
groves
and
thickets
like
bears
in
a
thick
wood
and
how
rich
too
is
the
life
of
the
sunny
air
every
leaf
and
flower
seems
to
have
its
winged
representative
overhead
shoot
in
vigorous
zigzags
through
the
dancing
swarms
and
a
rich
profusion
of
leguminosae
of
a
fine
addition
to
the
general
show
many
of
these
last
are
comparatively
small
at
this
elevation
and
as
yet
almost
unknown
to
science
but
every
now
and
then
a
familiar
vanessa
or
papilio
comes
sailing
past
too
are
quite
common
here
and
the
robin
is
always
found
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
or
out
in
the
shallowest
portions
of
the
sod
and
sometimes
the
grouse
and
mountain
quail
with
their
broods
of
precious
fluffy
chickens
swallows
skim
the
grassy
lake
from
end
to
end
come
and
go
in
fitful
flights
from
the
tops
of
dead
spars
while
woodpeckers
swing
across
from
side
to
side
in
graceful
festoon
curves
insects
and
flowers
all
in
their
own
way
telling
a
deep
summer
joy
the
influences
of
pure
nature
seem
to
be
so
little
known
as
yet
that
it
is
generally
supposed
that
complete
pleasure
of
this
kind
permeating
very
flesh
and
bones
unfits
the
student
for
scientific
pursuits
in
which
cool
judgment
and
observation
are
required
but
the
effect
is
just
the
opposite
instead
of
producing
a
dissipated
condition
the
mind
is
fertilized
and
stimulated
and
developed
like
plants
all
that
we
have
seen
here
enables
us
to
see
with
surer
vision
the
fountains
among
the
to
the
east
whence
flowed
the
glaciers
that
ground
soil
for
the
surrounding
forest
and
down
at
the
foot
of
the
meadow
the
moraine
which
formed
the
dam
which
gave
rise
to
the
lake
that
occupied
this
basin
before
the
meadow
was
made
and
around
the
margin
the
stones
that
were
shoved
back
and
piled
up
into
a
rude
wall
by
the
expansion
of
the
lake
ice
during
long
bygone
winters
and
along
the
sides
of
the
streams
the
slight
hollows
of
the
meadow
which
mark
those
portions
of
the
old
lake
that
were
the
last
to
vanish
i
would
fain
ask
my
readers
to
linger
awhile
in
this
fertile
wilderness
to
trace
its
history
from
its
earliest
glacial
beginnings
and
learn
what
we
may
of
its
wild
inhabitants
and
visitors
how
happy
the
birds
are
all
summer
and
some
of
them
all
winter
how
the
pouched
marmots
drive
tunnels
under
the
snow
and
how
fine
and
brave
a
life
the
slandered
coyote
lives
here
and
the
deer
and
bears
but
knowing
well
the
difference
between
reading
and
seeing
i
will
only
ask
attention
to
some
brief
sketches
of
its
varying
aspects
as
they
are
presented
throughout
the
more
marked
seasons
of
the
year
the
summer
life
we
have
been
depicting
lasts
with
but
little
abatement
until
october
when
the
night
frosts
begin
to
sting
bronzing
the
grasses
and
ripening
the
leaves
of
the
creeping
heathworts
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
to
reddish
purple
and
crimson
while
the
flowers
disappear
all
save
the
goldenrods
and
a
few
daisies
that
continue
to
bloom
on
unscathed
until
the
beginning
of
snowy
winter
in
still
nights
the
grass
panicles
and
every
leaf
and
stalk
are
laden
with
frost
crystals
through
which
the
morning
sunbeams
sift
in
ravishing
splendor
transforming
each
to
a
precious
diamond
radiating
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
the
brook
shallows
are
plaited
across
and
across
with
slender
lances
of
ice
but
both
these
and
the
grass
crystals
are
melted
before
midday
and
notwithstanding
the
great
elevation
of
the
meadow
the
afternoons
are
still
warm
enough
to
revive
the
chilled
butterflies
and
call
them
out
to
enjoy
the
goldenrods
the
divine
alpenglow
flushes
the
surrounding
forest
every
evening
followed
by
a
crystal
night
with
hosts
of
lily
stars
whose
size
and
brilliancy
can
not
be
conceived
by
those
who
have
never
risen
above
the
lowlands
thus
come
and
go
the
bright
of
autumn
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
week
after
week
until
near
december
then
comes
a
sudden
change
clouds
of
a
peculiar
aspect
with
a
slow
crawling
gait
gather
and
grow
in
the
azure
throwing
out
satiny
fringes
and
becoming
gradually
darker
until
every
rift
and
opening
is
closed
and
the
whole
bent
firmament
is
obscured
in
equal
structureless
gloom
then
comes
the
snow
for
the
clouds
are
ripe
the
meadows
of
the
sky
are
in
bloom
and
shed
their
radiant
blossoms
like
an
orchard
in
the
spring
lightly
lightly
they
lodge
in
the
brown
grasses
and
in
the
tasseled
needles
of
the
pines
falling
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
silently
lovingly
the
winds
hushed
and
circling
hither
thither
glinting
against
one
another
rays
interlocking
in
flakes
as
large
as
daisies
and
then
the
dry
grasses
and
the
trees
and
the
stones
are
all
equally
abloom
again
occur
here
during
the
summer
months
and
impressive
it
is
to
watch
the
coming
of
the
big
transparent
drops
each
a
small
world
in
itself
unbroken
ocean
without
islands
hurling
free
through
the
air
like
planets
through
space
but
still
more
impressive
to
me
is
the
coming
of
the
stars
winter
daisies
bloom
to
all
the
ground
alike
raindrops
blossom
brilliantly
in
the
rainbow
and
change
to
flowers
in
the
sod
but
snow
comes
in
full
flower
direct
from
the
dark
frozen
sky
the
later
are
oftentimes
accompanied
by
winds
that
break
up
the
crystals
when
the
temperature
is
low
into
single
petals
and
irregular
dusty
fragments
but
there
is
comparatively
little
drifting
on
the
meadow
so
securely
is
it
embosomed
in
the
woods
from
december
to
may
storm
succeeds
storm
until
the
snow
is
about
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
deep
but
the
surface
is
always
as
smooth
as
the
breast
of
a
bird
hushed
now
is
the
life
that
so
late
was
beating
warmly
most
of
the
birds
have
gone
down
below
the
the
plants
sleep
and
all
the
are
folded
yet
the
sun
beams
gloriously
many
a
cloudless
day
in
midwinter
casting
long
lance
shadows
athwart
the
dazzling
expanse
in
june
small
flecks
of
the
dead
decaying
sod
begin
to
appear
gradually
widening
and
uniting
with
one
another
covered
with
creeping
rags
of
water
during
the
day
and
ice
by
night
looking
as
hopeless
and
unvital
as
crushed
rocks
just
emerging
from
the
darkness
of
the
glacial
period
walk
the
meadow
now
scarce
the
memory
of
a
flower
will
you
find
the
ground
seems
twice
dead
nevertheless
the
annual
resurrection
is
drawing
near
the
sun
pours
his
floods
the
last
melts
myriads
of
growing
points
push
eagerly
through
the
steaming
mold
the
birds
come
back
new
wings
fill
the
air
and
fervid
summer
life
comes
surging
on
seemingly
yet
more
glorious
than
before
this
is
a
perfect
meadow
and
under
favorable
circumstances
exists
without
manifesting
any
marked
changes
for
centuries
nevertheless
soon
or
late
it
must
inevitably
grow
old
and
vanish
during
the
calm
indian
summer
scarce
a
moves
around
its
banks
but
in
and
soil
is
washed
forward
upon
it
and
laid
in
successive
sheets
around
its
gently
sloping
rim
and
is
gradually
extended
to
the
center
making
it
dryer
through
a
considerable
period
the
meadow
vegetation
is
not
greatly
affected
thereby
for
it
gradually
rises
with
the
rising
ground
keeping
on
the
surface
like
rising
on
the
swell
of
waves
but
at
length
the
elevation
of
the
goes
on
so
far
as
to
produce
too
dry
a
soil
for
the
specific
when
of
course
they
have
to
give
up
their
places
to
others
fitted
for
the
new
conditions
the
most
characteristic
of
the
newcomers
at
this
elevation
above
the
sea
are
principally
gilias
eriogonae
and
compositae
and
finally
henceforward
the
obscuring
changes
are
so
manifold
that
the
original
can
be
unveiled
and
seen
only
by
the
geologist
generally
speaking
glacier
lakes
vanish
more
slowly
than
the
meadows
that
succeed
them
because
unless
very
shallow
a
greater
quantity
of
material
is
required
to
fill
up
their
basins
and
obliterate
them
than
is
required
to
render
the
surface
of
the
meadow
too
high
and
dry
for
meadow
vegetation
furthermore
owing
to
the
weathering
to
which
the
adjacent
rocks
are
subjected
material
of
the
finer
sort
susceptible
of
transportation
by
rains
and
ordinary
floods
is
more
abundant
during
the
meadow
period
than
during
the
lake
period
yet
doubtless
many
a
fine
meadow
favorably
situated
exists
in
almost
prime
beauty
for
thousands
of
years
the
process
of
extinction
being
exceedingly
slow
as
we
reckon
time
this
is
especially
the
case
with
meadows
circumstanced
like
the
one
we
have
in
deep
woods
with
the
ground
rising
gently
away
from
it
all
around
the
network
of
in
which
all
the
ground
is
clasped
preventing
any
rapid
torrential
washing
but
in
exceptional
cases
beautiful
lawns
formed
with
great
deliberation
are
overwhelmed
and
obliterated
at
once
by
the
action
of
earthquake
avalanches
or
extraordinary
floods
just
as
lakes
are
in
those
glacier
meadows
that
take
the
places
of
shallow
lakes
which
have
been
fed
by
feeble
streams
glacier
mud
and
fine
vegetable
humus
enter
largely
into
the
composition
of
the
soil
and
on
account
of
the
shallowness
of
this
soil
and
the
seamless
undrained
condition
of
the
they
are
usually
wet
and
therefore
occupied
by
tall
grasses
and
sedges
whose
coarse
appearance
offers
a
striking
contrast
to
that
of
the
delicate
kind
described
above
these
meadows
are
oftentimes
still
further
roughened
and
diversified
by
partially
buried
moraines
and
swelling
bosses
of
the
which
with
the
trees
and
shrubs
growing
upon
them
produce
a
striking
effect
as
they
stand
in
relief
like
islands
in
the
grassy
level
or
sweep
across
in
rugged
curves
from
one
forest
wall
to
the
other
throughout
the
upper
meadow
region
wherever
water
is
sufficiently
abundant
and
low
in
temperature
in
basins
secure
from
handsome
bogs
are
formed
with
a
deep
growth
of
brown
and
yellow
sphagnum
picturesquely
ruined
with
patches
of
kalmia
and
ledum
which
ripen
masses
of
beautiful
color
in
the
autumn
between
these
cool
spongy
bogs
and
the
dry
flowery
meadows
there
are
many
interesting
varieties
which
are
graduated
into
one
another
by
the
varied
conditions
already
alluded
to
forming
a
series
of
delightful
studies
hanging
meadows
another
very
and
interesting
kind
of
meadow
differing
greatly
both
in
origin
and
appearance
from
the
is
found
lying
aslant
upon
hillsides
trending
in
the
direction
of
greatest
declivity
waving
up
and
down
over
rock
heaps
and
ledges
like
rich
green
ribbons
brilliantly
illumined
with
tall
flowers
they
occur
both
in
the
alpine
and
subalpine
regions
in
considerable
numbers
and
never
fail
to
make
telling
features
in
the
landscape
they
are
often
a
mile
or
more
in
length
but
never
very
from
thirty
to
fifty
yards
when
the
mountain
or
cañon
side
on
which
they
lie
dips
at
the
required
angle
and
other
conditions
are
at
the
same
time
favorable
they
extend
from
above
the
timber
line
to
the
bottom
of
a
cañon
or
lake
basin
descending
in
fine
fluent
lines
like
cascades
breaking
here
and
there
into
a
kind
of
spray
on
large
boulders
or
dividing
and
flowing
around
on
either
side
of
some
projecting
islet
sometimes
a
noisy
stream
goes
brawling
down
through
them
and
again
scarcely
a
drop
of
water
is
in
sight
they
owe
their
existence
however
to
streams
whether
visible
or
invisible
the
wildest
specimens
being
found
where
some
perennial
fountain
as
a
glacier
or
snowbank
or
moraine
spring
sends
down
its
waters
across
a
rough
sheet
of
soil
in
a
dissipated
web
of
feeble
oozing
rivulets
these
conditions
give
rise
to
a
meadowy
vegetation
whose
extending
roots
still
more
obstruct
the
free
flow
of
the
waters
and
tend
to
dissipate
them
out
over
a
yet
wider
area
thus
the
moraine
soil
and
the
necessary
moisture
requisite
for
the
better
class
of
meadow
plants
are
at
times
combined
about
as
perfectly
as
if
smoothly
outspread
on
a
level
surface
where
the
soil
happens
to
be
composed
of
the
finer
qualities
of
glacial
detritus
and
the
water
is
not
in
excess
the
nearest
approach
is
made
by
the
vegetation
to
that
of
the
but
where
as
is
more
commonly
the
case
the
soil
is
coarse
and
bouldery
the
vegetation
is
correspondingly
rank
tall
grasses
take
their
places
along
the
sides
and
rushes
and
nodding
carices
in
the
wetter
portions
mingled
with
the
most
beautiful
and
imposing
flowers
lilies
and
larkspurs
seven
or
eight
feet
high
lupines
senecios
aliums
many
species
of
mimulus
and
pentstemon

the
magnificent
alpine
columbine
with
spurs
an
inch
and
a
half
long
at
an
elevation
of
from
seven
to
nine
thousand
feet
showy
flowers
frequently
form
the
bulk
of
the
vegetation
then
the
hanging
meadows
become
hanging
gardens
in
rare
instances
we
find
an
alpine
basin
the
bottom
of
which
is
a
perfect
meadow
and
the
sides
nearly
all
the
way
round
rising
in
gentle
curves
are
covered
with
moraine
soil
which
being
saturated
with
melting
snow
from
encircling
fountains
gives
rise
to
an
almost
continuous
girdle
of
meadow
vegetation
that
blends
gracefully
into
the
level
meadow
at
the
bottom
thus
forming
a
grand
smooth
soft
mountain
nest
it
is
in
meadows
of
this
sort
that
the
mountain
beaver
loves
to
make
his
home
excavating
snug
chambers
beneath
the
sod
digging
canals
turning
the
underground
waters
from
channel
to
channel
to
suit
his
convenience
and
feeding
the
vegetation
another
kind
of
meadow
or
bog
occurs
on
densely
timbered
hillsides
where
small
perennial
streams
have
been
dammed
at
short
intervals
by
fallen
trees
still
another
kind
is
found
hanging
down
smooth
flat
precipices
while
corresponding
leaning
meadows
rise
to
meet
them
there
are
also
three
kinds
of
small
meadows
one
of
which
is
found
along
the
banks
of
the
main
streams
another
on
the
summits
of

david
douglas
an
enthusiastic
botanist
and
tree
lover
wandered
alone
through
fine
sections
of
the
sugar
pine
and
silver
fir
woods
wild
with
delight
a
few
years
later
other
botanists
made
short
journeys
from
the
coast
into
the
lower
woods
then
came
the
wonderful
multitude
of
miners
into
the
zone
mostly
blind
with
soon
followed
by
who
with
wool
over
their
eyes
chased
their
flocks
through
all
the
forest
belts
from
one
end
of
the
range
to
the
other
then
the
yosemite
valley
was
discovered
and
thousands
of
admiring
tourists
passed
through
sections
of
the
lower
and
middle
zones
on
their
way
to
that
wonderful
park
and
gained
fine
glimpses
of
the
sugar
pines
and
silver
firs
along
the
edges
of
dusty
trails
and
roads
but
few
indeed
strong
and
free
with
eyes
undimmed
with
care
have
gone
far
enough
and
lived
long
enough
with
the
trees
to
gain
anything
like
a
loving
conception
of
their
grandeur
and
significance
as
manifested
in
the
harmonies
of
their
distribution
and
varying
aspects
throughout
the
seasons
as
they
stand
arrayed
in
their
winter
garb
rejoicing
in
storms
putting
forth
their
fresh
leaves
in
the
spring
while
steaming
with
resiny
fragrance
receiving
the
of
summer
or
reposing
with
ripe
cones
in
the
rich
sungold
of
autumn
for
knowledge
of
this
kind
one
must
dwell
with
the
trees
and
grow
with
them
without
any
reference
to
time
in
the
almanac
sense
the
distribution
of
the
general
forest
in
belts
is
readily
perceived
these
as
we
have
seen
extend
in
regular
order
from
one
extremity
of
the
range
to
the
other
and
however
dense
and
somber
they
may
appear
in
general
views
neither
on
the
rocky
heights
nor
down
in
the
leafiest
hollows
will
you
find
anything
to
remind
you
of
the
dank
malarial
selvas
of
the
amazon
and
orinoco
with
their
contiguity
of
shade
the
monotonous
uniformity
of
the

the

view
in
the
sierra
forest
the
inviting
openness
of
the
sierra
woods
is
one
of
their
most
distinguishing
characteristics
the
trees
of
all
the
species
stand
more
or
less
apart
in
groves
or
in
small
irregular
groups
enabling
one
to
find
a
way
nearly
everywhere
along
sunny
colonnades
and
through
openings
that
have
a
smooth
surface
strewn
with
brown
needles
and
burs
now
you
cross
a
wild
garden
now
a
meadow
now
a
ferny
willowy
stream
and
ever
and
anon
you
emerge
from
all
the
groves
and
flowers
upon
some
granite
pavement
or
high
bare
ridge
commanding
superb
views
above
the
waving
sea

evergreens
far
and
near
one
would
experience
but
little
difficulty
in
riding
on
horseback
through
the
successive
belts
all
the
way
up
to
the
fringes
of
the
icy
peaks
the
deep
cañons
however
that
extend
from
the
axis
of
the
range
cut
the
belts
more
or
less
completely
into
sections
and
prevent
the
mounted
traveler
from
tracing
them
lengthwise
this
simple
arrangement
in
zones
and
sections
brings
the
forest
as
a
whole
within
the
comprehension
of
every
observer
the
different
species
are
ever
found
occupying
the

relative
positions
to
one
another
as
controlled
by
soil

the
comparative
vigor
of
each
species
in

holding
the
ground

so
appreciable

these
relations
one
need
never
be
at
a
loss
in
determining
within
a
few
hundred

the

for
notwithstanding
some
of
the
species

upward
for
several
thousand

even
those

enter

not
one

this

at

there
are
other

arrangement
of
the
forests
in
long
curving
bands
braided

the
key
to
this
beautiful
harmony
is
the
ancient

they
flowed

their
wavering
courses
along
cañons

over
high
rolling
plateaus

growing
upon

of
the
moraines
of
an
ancient
glacier
all
the
forests
of
the
sierra
are
growing
upon
moraines
but
moraines
vanish
like
the
glaciers
that
make
them
every
storm
that
falls
upon
them
wastes
them
cutting
gaps
disintegrating
boulders
and
carrying
away
their
decaying
material
into
new
formations
until
at
length
they
are
no
longer
recognizable
by
any
save
students
who
trace
their
transitional
forms
down
from
the
fresh
moraines
still
in
process
of
formation
through
those
that
are
more
and
more
ancient
and
more
and
more
obscured
by
vegetation
and
all
kinds
of
weathering
had
the
that
once
covered
all
the
range
been
melted
simultaneously
from
the
to
the
summits
the
flanks
would
of
course
have
been
left
almost
bare
of
soil
and
these
noble
forests
would
be
wanting
many
groves
and
thickets
would
undoubtedly
have
grown
up
on
lake
and
avalanche
beds
and
many
a
fair
flower
and
shrub
would
have
found
food
and
a

weathered
nooks

the
sierra
as
a
whole
would
have
been
a

therefore
that

it

usually
found

on
sunny
where
there
is

little

where

times

cañon
i
found
a
lonely
miner
seeking
his
fortune
in
a
quartz
vein
on
a
wild
planted
with
this
singular
tree
he
told
me
that
he
called
it
the
hickory
pine
because
of
the
whiteness
and
toughness
of
the
wood
it
is
so
little
known
however
that
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
common
name
most
mountaineers
refer
to
it
as
queer
little
covered
all
over
with
in
my
studies
of
this
species
i
found
a
very
interesting
and
significant
group
of
facts
whose
relations
will
be
seen
almost
as
soon
as
stated
all
the
trees
in
the
groves
i
examined
however
unequal
in
size
are
of
the

age
those
groves
are
all
planted
on
dry
hillsides
covered
with
chaparral
and
therefore
are
liable
to
be
swept
by
fire
there
are
no
seedlings
or
saplings
in
or
about
the
living
groves
but
there
is
always
a
fine
hopeful
crop
springing
up
on
the
ground

occupied
by
any
grove
that
has
been
destroyed
by
the
burning

a
full
discussion

the
bearing
of
these
facts
upon
one
another
would
perhaps
be
out
of
place
here
but
i
may
at
least
call
attention
to
the
admirable
adaptation
of
the
tree
to
the
regions
where
alone
it
is
found

a

has
been
destroyed
the
ground
is
at

sown
lavishly
with
all
the
seeds
ripened
during
its
whole
life
which
seem
to
have
been
carefully
held
in
store
with
reference
to
such
a
calamity
then
a
young
grove
immediately
springs
up

this
is
the
noblest
pine
yet
discovered
surpassing
all
others
not

in
size
but
also
in
kingly
beauty
and
majesty
it
towers
sublimely
from
every
ridge
and

of
the
range
at
an
elevation
of
from
three
to
seven
thousand
feet
above
the

attaining
most
perfect

at
a
height
of
about
feet
specimens
are
commonly
about
feet
high
and
from
six
to
eight
feet
in
diameter
near
the
ground
though
some
grand
old
patriarch
is
occasionally
met
that
has
enjoyed
five
or
six
centuries
of
storms
and
attained
a
thickness
of
ten

twelve

having
been
measured

high

from

the
discoverer
was
the
douglas
for
whom
the
noble
douglas

is
named
and
many
other
plants
which
will
keep
his
memory
sweet
and
fresh
as
long
as
trees
and
flowers
are
loved
his
first
visit
to
the
pacific
coast
was
made
in
the
year
the
oregon
indians
watched
him
with
curiosity
as
he
wandered
in
the
woods
collecting
specimens
and
unlike
the
strangers
they
had
hitherto
known
caring
nothing
about
trade
and
when
at
length
they
came
to
know
him
better
and
saw
that
from
year
to
year
the
growing
things
of
the
woods
and
prairies
were
his
only
objects
of
pursuit
they
called
him
man
of
grass
a
title
of
which
he
was
proud
during
his
first
summer
on
the
waters
of
the
columbia
he
made
fort
vancouver
his
headquarters
making
excursions
from
this
hudson
bay
post
in
every
direction
on
one
of
his
long
trips
he
saw
in
an
pouch
some
of
the
seeds
of
a
new
species
of
pine
which
he
learned
were
obtained
from
a
very
large
tree
far
to
the
southward
of
the
columbia
at
the
end
of
the
next
summer
returning
to
fort
vancouver
after
the
setting
in
of
the
winter
rains
bearing
in
mind
the
big
pine
he
had
heard
of
he
set
out
on
an
excursion
up
the
willamette
valley
in
search
of
it
and
how
he
fared
and
what
dangers
and
hardships
he
endured
are
best
told
in
his
own
journal
from
which
i
quote
as
follows
weather
dull
cold
and
cloudy
when
my
friends
in
england
are
made
acquainted
with
my
travels
i
fear
they
will
think
i
have
told
them
nothing
but
my
i
quitted
my
camp
early
in
the
morning
to
survey
the
neighboring
country
leaving
my
guide
to
take
charge
of
the
horses
until
my
return
in
the
evening
about
an
walk
from
the
camp
i
met
an
indian
who
on
perceiving
me
instantly
strung
his
bow
placed
on
his
left
arm
a
sleeve
of
raccoon
skin
and
stood
on
the
defensive
being
quite
sure
that
conduct
was
prompted
by
fear
and
not
by
hostile
intentions
the
poor
fellow
having
probably
never
seen
such
a
being
as
myself
before
i
laid
my
gun
at
my
feet
on
the
ground
and
waved
my
hand
for
him
to
come
to
me
which
he
did
slowly
and
with
great
caution
i
then
made
him
place
his
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
beside
my
gun
and
striking
a
light
gave
him
a
smoke
out
of
my
own
pipe
and
a
present
of
a
few
beads
with
my
pencil
i
made
a
rough
sketch
of
the
cone
and
pine
tree
which
i
wanted
to
obtain
and
drew
his
attention
to
it
when
he
instantly
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
hills
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
distant
towards
the
south
and
when
i
expressed
my
intention
of
going
thither
cheerfully
set
out
to
accompany
me
at
midday
i
reached
my
pines
and
lost
no
time
in
examining
them
and
endeavoring
to
collect
specimens
and
seeds
new
and
strange
things
seldom
fail
to
make
strong
impressions
and
are
therefore
frequently
so
that
lest
i
should
never
see
my
friends
in
england
to
inform
them
verbally
of
this
most
beautiful
and
immensely
grand
tree
i
shall
here
state
the
dimensions
of
the
largest
i
could
find
among
several
that
had
been
blown
down
by
the
wind
at
feet
from
the
ground
its
circumference
is
feet
inches
at
feet
feet
inches
the
extreme
length
as
it
was
impossible
either
to
climb
the
tree
or
hew
it
down
i
endeavored
to
knock
off
the
cones
by
firing
at
them
with
ball
when
the
report
of
my
gun
brought
eight
indians
all
of
them
painted
with
red
earth
armed
with
bows
arrows
spears
and
they
appeared
anything
but
friendly
i
explained
to
them
what
i
wanted
and
they
seemed
satisfied
and
sat
down
to
smoke
but
presently
i
saw
one
of
them
string
his
bow
and
another
sharpen
his
flint
knife
with
a
pair
of
wooden
pincers
and
suspend
it
off
the
wrist
of
his
right
hand
further
testimony
of
their
intentions
was
unnecessary
to
save
myself
by
flight
was
impossible
so
without
hesitation
i
stepped
back
about
five
paces
cocked
my
gun
drew
one
of
the
pistols
out
of
my
belt
and
holding
it
in
my
left
hand
and
the
gun
in
my
right
showed
myself
determined
to
fight
for
my
life
as
much
as
possible
i
endeavored
to
preserve
my
coolness
and
thus
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
without
making
any
movement
or
uttering
a
word
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
when
one
at
last
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
gave
a
sign
that
they
wished
for
some
tobacco
this
i
signified
that
they
should
have
if
they
fetched
a
quantity
of
cones
they
went
off
immediately
in
search
of
them
and
no
sooner
were
they
all
out
of
sight
than
i
picked
up
my
three
cones
and
some
twigs
of
the
trees
and
made
the
quickest
possible
retreat
hurrying
back
to
the
camp
which
i
reached
before
i
now
write
lying
on
the
grass
with
my
gun
cocked
beside
me
and
penning
these
lines
by
the
light
of
my
columbian
candle

ignited

delicately
tapered

lichen
at
the
top
of

magnificent
bole
long
curving
branches
sweep
gracefully
outward
and
downward
sometimes
forming
a
crown
but
far
more
nobly
impressive
than
any
palm
crown
i
ever
beheld
the
needles
are
about
three
inches
long
finely
tempered
and
arranged
in
rather
close
tassels
at
the
ends
of
slender
branchlets
that
clothe
the
long
outsweeping
limbs
how
well
they
sing
in
the
wind
and
how
strikingly
harmonious
an
effect
is
made
by
the
immense
cylindrical
cones
that
depend
loosely
from
the
ends
of
the
main
branches
no
one
knows
what
nature
can
do
in
the
way
of
until
he
has
seen
those

are
commonly
from
fifteen

shaded
with

the
flat
scales
open

the
empty
cones
become
still
more
beautiful

diameter

nearly
doubled

the
spreading

and

continue

in

have
oftentimes

beauty
of

hang
thick

are
ripening

it
is
during
cloudless
that
these
colossal
pines
are
most
impressively
beautiful
then
they
bow
like
willows
their
leaves
streaming
forward
all
in
one
direction
and
when
the
sun
shines
upon
them
at
the
required
angle
entire

glow
as
if

leaf
were
burnished

the
fall
of

on
the
royal

is
a
truly
glorious
spectacle
the
fervid
breaking
upon
the
glossy
leaves
in
long
like
mountain
water
among
boulders
but
to
me
there
is
something
more
impressive
in
the
fall
of
light
upon
these
silver
pines
it
seems
beaten
to
the
finest
dust
and
is
shed
off
in
myriads
of
minute
sparkles
that
seem
to
come
from
the
very
heart
of
the
trees

if
like
rain
falling
upon
fertile
soil
it
had
been
absorbed
to
reappear
in
flowers

tones

a

are
well
tempered
and
give
forth
no
uncertain
sound
each
standing
out
with
no
interference
excepting
during
heavy
gales
then
you
may
detect
the
click
of
one
needle
upon
another
readily
distinguishable
from
their
free
hum
some
idea
of
their
temper
may
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
they
are
so
long
the
vibrations
that
give
rise
to
the
peculiar
shimmering
of
the
light
are
made
at
the

fifty

when
you
stand
back
far
enough
to
see
the
massive
columns
from
the
swelling
instep
to
the
lofty
summit
dissolving
in
a
dome
of
verdure
you
rejoice
in
the
unrivaled
display
of
combined
grandeur
and
beauty
about
a
hundred
feet
or
more
of
the
trunk
is
usually
branchless
but
its
massive
simplicity
is
relieved
by
the
bark
furrows
which
instead
of
making
an
irregular
network
run
evenly
parallel
like
the
fluting
of
an
architectural
column
and
to
some
extent
by
tufts
of
slender
sprays
that
wave
lightly
in
the
winds
and
cast
flecks
of
shade
seeming
to
have
been
pinned
on
here
and
there
for
the
sake
of
beauty
only
the
young
trees
have
slender
simple
branches
down
to
the
ground
put
on
with
strict
regularity
sharply
aspiring
at
the
top
horizontal
about
down
and
drooping
in
handsome
curves
at
the
base
by
the
time
the
sapling
is
five
or
six
hundred
years
old
this
spiry
feathery
juvenile
habit
merges
into
the
firm
rounded
dome
form
of
middle
age
which
in
turn
takes
on
the
eccentric
picturesqueness
of
old
age
no
other
tree
in
the
sierra
forest
has
foliage
so
densely
massed
or
presents
outlines
so
firmly
drawn
and
so
steadily
subordinate
to
a
special
type
a
knotty
branch
five
to
eight
feet
thick
may
be
seen
pushing
out
abruptly
from
the
smooth
trunk
as
if
sure
to
throw
the
regular
curve
into
confusion
but
as
soon
as
the
general
outline
is
reached
it
stops
short
and
dissolves
in
spreading
bosses
of
sprays
just
as
if
every
tree
were
growing
beneath
some
huge
invisible
against
whose
sides
every
branch
was
being
pressed
and
molded
yet
somehow
indulging
in
so
many
small
departures
from
the
regular
form
that
there
is
still
an
appearance
of
freedom
the
foliage
of
the
saplings
is
dark
in
color
while
the
older
trees
ripen
to
a
warm
tint
like
libocedrus
the
bark
is
rich
purplish
in
young
trees
and
in
shady
portions
of
the
old
while
the
ground
is
covered
with
brown
leaves
and
burs
forming
of
extraordinary
richness
not
to
mention
the
flowers
and
underbrush
that
rejoice
about
them
in
their
seasons
walk
the
sequoia
woods
at
any
time
of
year
and
you
will
say
they
are
the
most
beautiful
and
majestic
on
earth
beautiful
and
impressive
contrasts
meet
you
everywhere
the
colors
of
tree
and
flower
rock
and
sky
light
and
shade
strength
and
frailty
endurance
and
evanescence
tangles
of
supple
about
as
rigid
as
granite
domes
roses
and
violets
the
smallest
of
their
kind
blooming
around
the
feet
of
the
giants
and
rugs
of
the
lowly
chamaebatia
where
the
sunbeams
fall
then
in
winter
the
trees
themselves
break
forth
in
bloom
myriads
of
small
staminate
cones
crowd
the
ends
of
the
slender
sprays
coloring
the
whole
tree
and
when
ripe
dusting
the
air
and
the
ground
with
golden
pollen
the
fertile
cones
are
bright
measuring
about
two
inches
in
length
by
one
and
a
half
in
thickness
and
are
made
up
of
about
forty
firm
rhomboidal
scales
densely
packed
with
from
five
to
eight
seeds
at
the
base
of
each
a
single
cone
therefore
contains
from
two
to
three
hundred
seeds
which
are
about
a
fourth
of
an
inch
long
by
three
sixteenths
wide
including
a
thin
flat
margin
that
makes
them
go
glancing
and
wavering
in
their
fall
like
a
kite
the
fruitfulness
of
sequoia
may
be
illustrated
by
two
specimen
branches
one
and
a
half
and
two
inches
in
diameter
on
which
i
counted
cones
no
other
sierra
conifer
produces
nearly
so
many
seeds
millions
are
ripened
annually
by
a
single
tree
and
in
a
fruitful
year
the
product
of
one
of
the
northern
groves
would
be
enough
to
plant
all
the
of
the
world
nature
takes
care
however
that
not
one
seed
in
a
million
shall
germinate
at
all
and
of
those
that
do
perhaps
not
one
in
ten
thousand
is
suffered
to
live
through
the
many
vicissitudes
of
storm
drought
fire
and
that
beset
their
youth
the
douglas
squirrel
is
the
happy
harvester
of
most
of
the
sequoia
cones
out
of
every
hundred
perhaps
ninety
fall
to
his
share
and
unless
cut
off
by
his
ivory
sickle
they
shake
out
their
seeds
and
remain
on
the
tree
for
many
years
watching
the
squirrels
at
their
harvest
work
in
the
indian
summer
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
diversions
imaginable
the
woods
are
calm
and
the
ripe
colors
are
blazing
in
all
their
glory
the
trees
stand
motionless
in
the
warm
hazy
air
and
you
may
see
the
woodcock
the
prince
of
sierra
woodpeckers
drilling
some
dead
limb
or
fallen
trunk
with
his
bill
and
ever
and
anon
filling
the
glens
with
his
happy
cackle
the
too
dwells
in
these
noble
woods
and
may
oftentimes
be
seen
glancing
among
the
flowers
or
resting
on
some
leafless
twig
here
also
are
the
familiar
robin
of
the
orchards
and
the
brown
and
grizzly
bears
so
obviously
fitted
for
these
majestic
solitudes
and
the
douglas
squirrel
making
more
hilarious
exuberant
vital
stir
than
all
the
bears
birds
and
humming
wings
together
as
soon
as
any
accident
happens
to
the
crown
of
these
sequoias
such
as
being
stricken
off
by
lightning
or
broken
by
storms
then
the
branches
beneath
the
wound
no
matter
how
situated
seem
to
be
excited
like
a
colony
of
bees
that
have
lost
their
queen
and
become
anxious
to
repair
the
damage
limbs
that
have
grown
outward
for
centuries
at
right
angles
to
the
trunk
begin
to
turn
upward
to
assist
in
making
a
new
crown
each
speedily
assuming
the
special
form
of
true
summits
even
in
the
case
of
mere
stumps
burned
half
through
some
mere
ornamental
tuft
will
try
to
go
aloft
and
do
its
best
as
a
leader
in
forming
a
new
head
groups
of
two
or
three
of
these
grand
trees
are
often
found
standing
close
together
the
seeds
from
which
they
sprang
having
probably
grown
on
ground
cleared
for
their
reception
by
the
fall
of
a
large
tree
of
a
former
generation
these
patches
of
fresh
mellow
soil
beside
the
upturned
roots
of
the
fallen
giant
may
be
from
forty
to
sixty
feet
wide
and
they
are
speedily
occupied
by
seedlings
out
of
these
perhaps
two
or
three
may
become
trees
forming
those
close
groups
called
graces
couples
etc
for
even
supposing
that
the
trees
should
stand
twenty
or
thirty
feet
apart
while
young
by
the
time
they
are
their
trunks
will
touch
and
crowd
against
each
other
and
even
appear
as
one
in
some
cases
it
is
generally
believed
that
this
grand
sequoia
was
once
far
more
widely
distributed
over
the
sierra
but
after
long
and
careful
study
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
never
was
at
least
since
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
because
a
diligent
search
along
the
margins
of
the
groves
and
in
the
gaps
between
fails
to
reveal
a
single
trace
of
its
previous
existence
beyond
its
present
bounds
notwithstanding
i
feel
confident
that
if
every
sequoia
in
the
range
were
to
die
numerous
monuments
of
their
existence
would
remain
of
so
imperishable
a
nature
as
to
be
available
for
the
student
more
than
ten
thousand
years
hence
in
the
first
place
we
might
notice
that
no
species
of
coniferous
tree
in
the
range
keeps
its
individuals
so
well
together
as
sequoia
a
mile
is
perhaps
the
greatest
distance
of
any
straggler
from
the
main
body
and
all
of
those
stragglers
that
have
come
under
my
observation
are
young
instead
of
old
monumental
trees
relics
of
a
more
extended
growth
again
sequoia
trunks
frequently
endure
for
centuries
after
they
fall
i
have
a
specimen
block
cut
from
a
fallen
trunk
which
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
specimens
cut
from
living
trees
although
the
old
from
which
it
was
derived
has
lain
in
the
damp
forest
more
than
years
probably
thrice
as
long
the
time
measure
in
the
case
is
simply
this
when
the
ponderous
trunk
to
which
the
old
vestige
belonged
fell
it
sunk
itself
into
the
ground
thus
making
a
long
straight
ditch
and
in
the
middle
of
this
ditch
a
silver
fir
is
growing
that
is
now
four
feet
in
diameter
and
years
old
as
determined
by
cutting
it
half
through
and
counting
the
rings
thus
demonstrating
that
the
remnant
of
the
trunk
that
made
the
ditch
has
lain
on
the
ground
than
years
for
it
is
evident
that
to
find
the
whole
time
we
must
add
to
the
years
the
time
that
the
vanished
portion
of
the
trunk
lay
in
the
ditch
before
being
burned
out
of
the
way
plus
the
time
that
passed
before
the
seed
from
which
the
monumental
fir
sprang
fell
into
the
prepared
soil
and
took
root
now
because
sequoia
trunks
are
never
wholly
consumed
in
one
forest
fire
and
those
fires
recur
only
at
considerable
intervals
and
because
sequoia
ditches
after
being
cleared
are
often
left
unplanted
for
centuries
it
becomes
evident
that
the
trunk
remnant
in
question
may
probably
have
lain
a
thousand
years
or
more
and
this
instance
is
by
no
means
a
rare
one
but
admitting
that
upon
those
areas
supposed
to
have
been
once
covered
with
sequoia
every
tree
may
have
fallen
and
every
trunk
may
have
been
burned
or
buried
leaving
not
a
remnant
many
of
the
ditches
made
by
the
fall
of
the
ponderous
trunks
and
the
bowls
made
by
their
upturning
roots
would
remain
patent
for
thousands
of
years
after
the
last
vestige
of
the
trunks
that
made
them
had
vanished
much
of
this
would
no
doubt
be
quickly
effaced
by
the
of
overflowing
streams
and
but
no
inconsiderable
portion
would
remain
enduringly
engraved
on
beyond
such
destructive
action
for
where
all
the
conditions
are
favorable
it
is
almost
imperishable
these
historic
ditches
and
root
bowls
occur
in
all
the
present
sequoia
groves
and
forests
but
as
far
as
i
have
observed
not
the
faintest
vestige
of
one
presents
itself
outside
of
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
area
covered
by
sequoia
has
not
been
diminished
during
the
last
eight
or
ten
thousand
years
and
probably
not
at
all
in
times
the
species
verging
to
extinction
what
are
its
relations
to
climate
soil
and
associated
trees
all
the
phenomena
bearing
on
these
questions
also
throw
light
as
we
shall
endeavor
to
show
upon
the
peculiar
distribution
of
the
species
and
sustain
the
conclusion
already
arrived
at
on
the
question
of
extension
in
the
northern
groups
as
we
have
seen
there
are
few
young
trees
or
saplings
growing
up
around
the
failing
old
ones
to
perpetuate
the
race
and
in
as
much
as
those
aged
sequoias
so
nearly
childless
are
the
only
ones
commonly
known
the
species
to
most
observers
seems
doomed
to
speedy
extinction
as
being
nothing
more
than
an
expiring
remnant
vanquished
in
the
struggle
for
life
by
pines
and
firs
that
have
driven
it
into
its
last
strongholds
in
moist
glens
where
climate
is
exceptionally
favorable
but
the
language
of
the
majestic
continuous
forests
of
the
south
creates
a
very
different
impression
no
tree
of
all
the
forest
is
more
enduringly
established
in
concordance
with
climate
and
soil
it
grows
heartily
moraines
rocky
ledges
along
watercourses
and
in
the
deep
moist
alluvium
of
meadows
with
a
multitude
of
seedlings
and
saplings
crowding
up
around
the
aged
seemingly
abundantly
able
to
maintain
the
forest
in
prime
vigor
for
every
old
tree
there
is
one
or
more
in
all
the
glory
of
prime
and
for
each
of
these
many
young
trees
and
crowds
of
exuberant
saplings
so
that
if
all
the
trees
of
any
section
of
the
main
sequoia
forest
were
ranged
together
according
to
age
a
very
promising
curve
would
be
presented
all
the
way
up
from
last
seedlings
to
giants
and
with
the
young
and
portion
of
the
curve
many
times
longer
than
the
old
portion
even
as
far
north
as
the
fresno
i
counted
saplings
and
seedlings
growing
promisingly
upon
a
piece
of
rough
avalanche
soil
not
exceeding
two
acres
in
area
this
soil
bed
is
about
seven
years
old
and
has
been
seeded
almost
simultaneously
by
pines
firs
libocedrus
and
sequoia
presenting
a
simple
and
instructive
illustration
of
the
struggle
for
life
among
the
rival
species
and
it
was
interesting
to
note
that
the
conditions
thus
far
affecting
them
have
enabled
the
young
sequoias
to
gain
a
marked
advantage
in
every
instance
like
the
above
i
have
observed
that
the
seedling
sequoia
is
capable
of
growing
on
both
drier
and
wetter
soil
than
its
rivals
but
requires
more
sunshine
than
they
the
latter
fact
being
clearly
shown
wherever
a
sugar
pine
or
fir
is
growing
in
close
contact
with
a
sequoia
of
about
equal
age
and
size
and
equally
exposed
to
the
sun
the
branches
of
the
latter
in
such
cases
are
always
less
leafy
toward
the
south
however
where
the
sequoia
becomes
exuberant
and
numerous
the
rival
trees
become
so
and
where
they
mix
with
sequoias
they
mostly
grow
up
beneath
them
like
slender
grasses
among
stalks
of
indian
corn
upon
a
bed
of
sandy
i
counted
sequoias
from
one
to
twelve
feet
high
on
a
patch
of
ground
once
occupied
by
four
large
sugar
pines
which
lay
crumbling
beneath
them
instance
of
conditions
which
have
enabled
sequoias
to
crowd
out
the
pines
illustration
muir

tuolumne
national
park
i
also
noted
vigorous
saplings
upon
a
piece
of
fresh
ground
prepared
for
their
reception
by
fire
thus
fire
the
great
destroyer
of
sequoia
also
furnishes
bare
virgin
ground
one
of
the
conditions
essential
for
its
growth
from
the
seed
fresh
ground
is
however
furnished
in
sufficient
quantities
for
the
constant
renewal
of
the
forests
without
fire
by
the
fall
of
old
trees
the
soil
is
thus
upturned
and
mellowed
and
many
trees
are
planted
for
every
one
that
falls
and
floods
also
give
rise
to
bare
virgin
ground
and
a
tree
now
and
then
owes
its
existence
to
a
burrowing
wolf
or
squirrel
but
the
most
regular
supply
of
fresh
soil
is
furnished
by
the
fall
of
aged
trees
the
climatic
changes
in
progress
in
the
sierra
bearing
on
the
tenure
of
tree
life
are
entirely
misapprehended
especially
as
to
the
time
and
the
means
employed
by
nature
in
effecting
them
it
is
constantly
asserted
in
a
vague
way
that
the
sierra
was
vastly
wetter
than
now
and
that
the
increasing
drought
will
of
itself
extinguish
sequoia
leaving
its
ground
to
other
trees
supposed
capable
of
nourishing
in
a
drier
climate
but
that
sequoia
can
and
does
grow
on
as
dry
ground
as
any
of
its
present
rivals
is
manifest
in
a
thousand
places
then
it
will
be
asked
sequoias
always
found
in
greatest
abundance
in
places
where
streams
are
exceptionally
abundant
simply
because
a
growth
of
sequoias
creates
those
streams
the
thirsty
mountaineer
knows
well
that
in
every
sequoia
grove
he
will
find
running
water
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
water
is
the
cause
of
the
grove
being
there
on
the
contrary
the
grove
is
the
cause
of
the
water
being
there
drain
off
the
water
and
the
trees
will
remain
but
cut
off
the
trees
and
the
streams
will
vanish
never
was
cause
more
completely
mistaken
for
effect
than
in
the
case
of
these
related
phenomena
of
sequoia
woods
and
perennial
streams
and
i
confess
that
at
first
i
shared
in
the
blunder
when
attention
is
called
to
the
method
of
sequoia
it
will
be
apprehended
at
once
the
roots
of
this
immense
tree
fill
the
ground
forming
a
thick
sponge
that
absorbs
and
holds
back
the
rains
and
melting
snows
only
allowing
them
to
ooze
and
flow
gently
indeed
every
fallen
leaf
and
rootlet
as
well
as
long
clasping
root
and
prostrate
trunk
may
be
regarded
as
a
dam
hoarding
the
bounty
of
and
dispensing
it
as
blessings
all
through
the
summer
instead
of
allowing
it
to
go
headlong
in
floods
evaporation
is
also
checked
by
the
dense
foliage
to
a
greater
extent
than
by
any
other
sierra
tree
and
the
air
is
entangled
in
masses
and
broad
sheets
that
are
quickly
saturated
while
thirsty
winds
are
not
allowed
to
go
sponging
and
licking
along
the
ground
so
great
is
the
retention
of
water
in
many
places
in
the
main
belt
that
bogs
and
meadows
are
created
by
the
killing
of
the
trees
a
single
trunk
falling
across
a
stream
in
the
woods
forms
a
dam
feet
long
and
from
ten
to
thirty
feet
high
giving
rise
to
a
pond
which
kills
the
trees
within
its
reach
these
dead
trees
fall
in
turn
thus
making
a
clearing
while
sediments
gradually
accumulate
changing
the
pond
into
a
bog
or
meadow
for
a
growth
of
carices
and
sphagnum
in
some
instances
a
series
of
small
bogs
or
meadows
rise
above
one
another
on
a
hillside
which
are
gradually
merged
into
one
another
forming
sloping
bogs
or
meadows
which
make
striking
features
of
sequoia
woods
and
since
all
the
trees
that
have
fallen
into
them
have
been
preserved
they
contain
records
of
the
generations
that
have
passed
since
they
began
to
form
since
then
it
is
a
fact
that
thousands
of
sequoias
are
growing
thriftily
on
what
is
termed
dry
ground
and
even
clinging
like
mountain
pines
to
rifts
in
granite
precipices
and
since
it
has
also
been
shown
that
the
extra
moisture
found
in
connection
with
the
denser
growths
is
an
effect
of
their
presence
instead
of
a
cause
of
their
presence
then
the
notions
as
to
the
former
extension
of
the
species
and
its
near
approach
to
extinction
based
upon
its
supposed
dependence
on
greater
moisture
are
seen
to
be
erroneous
the
decrease
in
the
and
since
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
in
the
sierra
is
much
less
than
is
commonly
guessed
the
highest
watermarks
are
well
preserved
in
all
the
upper
river
channels
and
they
are
not
greatly
higher
than
the
spring
floodmarks
of
the
present
showing
conclusively
that
no
extraordinary
decrease
has
taken
place
in
the
volume
of
the
upper
tributaries
of
sierra
streams
since
they
came
into
existence
but
in
the
mean
time
eliminating
all
this
complicated
question
of
climatic
change
the
plain
fact
remains
that
present
and
is
abundantly
sufficient
for
the
luxuriant
growth
of
sequoia
indeed
all
my
observations
tend
to
show
that
in
a
prolonged
drought
the
sugar
pines
and
firs
would
perish
before
the
sequoia
not
alone
because
of
the
greater
longevity
of
individual
trees
but
because
the
species
can
endure
more
drought
and
make
the
most
of
whatever
moisture
falls
again
if
the
restriction
and
irregular
distribution
of
the
species
be
interpreted
as
a
result
of
the
desiccation
of
the
range
then
instead
of
increasing
as
it
does
in
individuals
toward
the
south
where
the
rainfall
is
less
it
should
diminish
if
then
the
peculiar
distribution
of
sequoia
has
not
been
governed
by
superior
conditions
of
soil
as
to
fertility
or
moisture
by
what
has
it
been
governed
in
the
course
of
my
studies
i
observed
that
the
northern
groves
the
only
ones
i
was
at
first
acquainted
with
were
located
on
just
those
portions
of
the
general
forest
that
were
first
laid
bare
toward
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
when
the
began
to
break
up
into
individual
glaciers
and
while
searching
the
wide
basin
of
the
san
joaquin
and
trying
to
account
for
the
absence
of
sequoia
where
every
condition
seemed
favorable
for
its
growth
it
occured
to
me
that
this
remarkable
gap
in
the
sequoia
belt
is
located
exactly
in
the
basin
of
the
vast
ancient
de
of
the
san
joaquin
and
river
basins
which
poured
its
frozen
floods
to
the
plain
fed
by
the
snows
that
fell
on
more
than
fifty
miles
of
the
summit
i
then
perceived
that
the
next
great
gap
in
the
belt
to
the
northward
forty
miles
wide
extending
between
the
calaveras
and
tuolumne
groves
occurs
in
the
basin
of
the
great
ancient
de
of
the
tuolumne
and
stanislaus
basins
and
that
the
smaller
gap
between
the
merced
and
mariposa
groves
occurs
in
the
basin
of
the
smaller
glacier
of
the
merced
wider
the
ancient
glacier
the
wider
the
corresponding
gap
in
the
sequoia
finally
pursuing
my
investigations
across
the
basins
of
the
kaweah
and
tule
i
discovered
that
the
sequoia
belt
attained
its
greatest
development
just
where
owing
to
the
topographical
peculiarities
of
the
region
the
ground
had
been
most
perfectly
protected
from
the
main
that
continued
to
pour
past
from
the
summit
fountains
long
after
the
smaller
local
glaciers
had
been
melted
taking
now
a
general
view
of
the
belt
beginning
at
the
south
we
see
that
the
majestic
ancient
glaciers
were
shed
off
right
and
left
down
the
valleys
of
kern
and
rivers
by
the
lofty
protective
spurs
outspread
embracingly
above
the
warm
basins
of
the
kaweah
and
tule
then
next
northward
occurs
the
wide
channel
or
basin
of
the
ancient
san
joaquin
and
river
de
then
the
warm
protected
spots
of
fresno
and
mariposa
groves
then
the
channel
of
the
ancient
merced
glacier
next
the
warm
sheltered
ground
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
groves
then
the
channel
of
the
grand
ancient
de
of
the
tuolumne
and
stanislaus
then
the
warm
old
ground
of
the
calaveras
and
stanislaus
groves
it
appears
therefore
that
just
where
at
a
certain
period
in
the
history
of
the
sierra
the
glaciers
were
not
there
the
sequoia
is
and
just
where
the
glaciers
were
there
the
sequoia
is
not
illustration
view
in
tuolumne
cañon
yosemite
national
park
what
the
other
conditions
may
have
been
that
enabled
sequoia
to
establish
itself
upon
these
oldest
and
warmest
portions
of
the
main
glacial
i
can
not
say
i
might
venture
to
state
however
in
this
connection
that
since
the
sequoia
forests
present
a
more
and
more
ancient
aspect
as
they
extend
southward
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
species
was
distributed
from
the
south
while
the
sugar
pine
its
great
rival
in
the
northern
groves
seems
to
have
come
around
the
head
of
the
sacramento
valley
and
down
the
sierra
from
the
north
consequently
when
the
sierra
were
first
thrown
open
to
preemption
on
the
melting
of
the
the
sequoia
may
have
established
itself
along
the
available
portions
of
the
south
half
of
the
range
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
sugar
pine
while
the
sugar
pine
took
possession
of
the
north
half
prior
to
the
arrival
of
sequoia
but
however
much
uncertainty
may
attach
to
this
branch
of
the
question
there
are
no
obscuring
shadows
upon
the
grand
general
relationship
we
have
pointed
out
between
the
present
distribution
of
sequoia
and
the
ancient
glaciers
of
the
sierra
and
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
all
the
present
forests
of
the
sierra
are
young
growing
on
moraine
soil
recently
deposited
and
that
the
flank
of
the
range
itself
with
all
its
landscapes
is
recently
sculptured
and
brought
to
the
light
of
day
from
beneath
the
ice
mantle
of
the
glacial
winter
then
a
thousand
lawless
mysteries
disappear
and
broad
harmonies
take
their
places
but
although
all
the
observed
phenomena
bearing
on
the
history
of
this
colossal
tree
point
to
the
conclusion
that
it
never
was
more
widely
distributed
on
the
sierra
since
the
close
of
the
glacial
epoch
that
its
present
forests
are
scarcely
past
prime
if
indeed
they
have
reached
prime
that
the
day
of
the
species
is
probably
not
half
done
yet
when
from
a
wider
outlook
the
vast
antiquity
of
the
genus
is
considered
and
its
ancient
richness
in
species
and
individuals
comparing
our
sierra
giant
and
of
the
coast
range
the
only
other
living
species
of
sequoia
with
the
twelve
fossil
species
already
discovered
and
described
by
heer
and
lesquereux
some
of
which
seem
to
have
flourished
over
vast
areas
in
the
arctic
regions
and
in
europe
and
our
own
territories
during
tertiary
and
cretaceous
times
indeed
it
becomes
plain
that
our
two
surviving
species
restricted
to
narrow
belts
within
the
limits
of
california
are
mere
remnants
of
the
genus
both
as
to
species
and
individuals
and
that
they
probably
are
verging
to
extinction
but
the
verge
of
a
period
beginning
in
cretaceous
times
may
have
a
breadth
of
tens
of
thousands
of
years
not
to
mention
the
possible
existence
of
conditions
calculated
to
multiply
and
reëxtend
both
species
and
individuals
this
however
is
a
branch
of
the
question
into
which
i
do
not
now
purpose
to
enter
in
studying
the
fate
of
our
forest
king
we
have
thus
far
considered
the
action
of
purely
natural
causes
only
but
unfortunately
is
in
the
woods
and
waste
and
pure
destruction
are
making
rapid
headway
if
the
importance
of
forests
were
at
all
understood
even
from
an
economic
standpoint
their
preservation
would
call
forth
the
most
watchful
attention
of
government
only
of
late
years
by
means
of
forest
reservations
has
the
simplest
groundwork
for
available
legislation
been
laid
while
in
many
of
the
finest
groves
every
species
of
destruction
is
still
moving
on
with
accelerated
speed
in
the
course
of
my
explorations
i
found
no
fewer
than
five
mills
located
on
or
near
the
lower
edge
of
the
sequoia
belt
all
of
which
were
cutting
considerable
quantities
of
big
tree
lumber
most
of
the
fresno
group
are
doomed
to
feed
the
mills
recently
erected
near
them
and
a
company
of
lumbermen
are
now
cutting
the
magnificent
forest
on
river
in
these
milling
operations
waste
far
exceeds
use
for
after
the
choice
young
manageable
trees
on
any
given
spot
have
been
felled
the
woods
are
fired
to
clear
the
ground
of
limbs
and
refuse
with
reference
to
further
operations
and
of
course
most
of
the
seedlings
and
saplings
are
destroyed
these
mill
ravages
however
are
small
as
compared
with
the
comprehensive
destruction
caused
by
incredible
numbers
of
sheep
are
driven
to
the
mountain
pastures
every
summer
and
their
course
is
ever
marked
by
desolation
every
wild
garden
is
trodden
down
the
shrubs
are
stripped
of
leaves
as
if
devoured
by
locusts
and
the
woods
are
burned
running
fires
are
set
everywhere
with
a
view
to
clearing
the
ground
of
prostrate
trunks
to
facilitate
the
movements
of
the
flocks
and
improve
the
pastures
the
entire
forest
belt
is
thus
swept
and
devastated
from
one
extremity
of
the
range
to
the
other
and
with
the
exception
of
the
resinous
sequoia
suffers
most
of
all
indians
burn
off
the
underbrush
in
certain
localities
to
facilitate
mountaineers
and
lumbermen
carelessly
allow
their
to
run
but
the
fires
of
the
sheepmen
or
form
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
all
destructive
fires
that
range
the
sierra
forests
it
appears
therefore
that
notwithstanding
our
forest
king
might
live
on
gloriously
in
keeping
it
is
rapidly
vanishing
before
the
fire
and
steel
of
man
and
unless
protective
measures
be
speedily
invented
and
applied
in
a
few
decades
at
the
farthest
all
that
will
be
left
of
will
be
a
few
hacked
and
scarred
monuments
or
tamarack
pine
this
species
forms
the
bulk
of
the
alpine
forests
extending
along
the
range
above
the
fir
zone
up
to
a
height
of
from
to
feet
above
the
sea
growing
in
beautiful
order
upon
moraines
that
are
scarcely
changed
as
yet
by
weathering
compared
with
the
giants
of
the
lower
zones
this
is
a
small
tree
seldom
attaining
a
height
of
a
hundred
feet
the
largest
specimen
i
ever
measured
was
ninety
feet
in
height
and
a
little
over
six
in
diameter
four
feet
from
the
ground
the
average
height
of
mature
trees
throughout
the
entire
belt
is
probably
not
far
from
fifty
or
sixty
feet
with
a
diameter
of
two
feet
it
is
a
rather
handsome
little
pine
with
bark
and
crooked
branches
which
cover
the
greater
portion
of
the
trunk
not
so
densely
however
as
to
prevent
its
being
seen
the
lower
limbs
curve
downward
gradually
take
a
horizontal
position
about
up
the
trunk
then
aspire
more
and
more
toward
the
summit
thus
forming
a
sharp
conical
top
the
foliage
is
short
and
rigid
two
leaves
in
a
fascicle
arranged
in
comparatively
long
cylindrical
tassels
at
the
ends
of
the
tough
branchlets
the
cones
are
about
two
inches
long
growing
in
stiff
clusters
among
the
needles
without
making
any
striking
effect
except
while
very
young
when
they
are
of
a
vivid
crimson
color
and
the
whole
tree
appears
to
be
dotted
with
brilliant
flowers
the
sterile
cones
are
still
more
showy
on
account
of
their
great
abundance
often
giving
a
tinge
to
the
whole
mass
of
the
foliage
and
filling
the
air
with
pollen
no
other
pine
on
the
range
is
so
regularly
planted
as
this
one
moraine
forests
sweep
along
the
sides
of
the
high
rocky
valleys
for
miles
without
interruption
still
strictly
speaking
they
are
not
dense
for
flecks
of
sunshine
and
flowers
find
their
way
into
the
darkest
places
where
the
trees
grow
tallest
and
thickest
tall
nutritious
grasses
are
specially
abundant
beneath
them
growing
over
all
the
ground
in
sunshine
and
shade
over
extensive
areas
like
a
crop
and
serving
as
pasture
for
the
multitude
of
sheep
that
are
driven
from
the
arid
plains
every
summer
as
soon
as
the
snow
is
melted
the
pine
more
than
any
other
is
subject
to
destruction
by
fire
the
thin
bark
is
streaked
and
sprinkled
with
resin
as
though
it
had
been
showered
down
upon
it
like
rain
so
that
even
the
green
trees
catch
fire
readily
and
during
strong
winds
whole
forests
are
destroyed
the
flames
leaping
from
tree
to
tree
forming
one
continuous
belt
of
roaring
fire
that
goes
surging
and
racing
onward
above
the
bending
woods
like
the
of
a
prairie
during
the
calm
dry
season
of
indian
summer
the
fire
creeps
quietly
along
the
ground
feeding
on
the
dry
needles
and
burs
then
arriving
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
resiny
bark
is
ignited
and
the
heated
air
ascends
in
a
powerful
current
increasing
in
velocity
and
dragging
the
flames
swiftly
upward
then
the
leaves
catch
fire
and
an
immense
column
of
flame
beautifully
spired
on
the
edges
and
tinted
a
hue
rushes
aloft
thirty
or
forty
feet
above
the
top
of
the
tree
forming
a
grand
spectacle
especially
on
a
dark
night
it
lasts
however
only
a
few
seconds
vanishing
with
magical
rapidity
to
be
succeeded
by
others
along
the
at
irregular
intervals
for
weeks
at
a
after
tree
flashing
and
darkening
leaving
the
trunks
and
branches
hardly
scarred
the
heat
however
is
sufficient
to
kill
the
trees
and
in
a
few
years
the
bark
shrivels
and
falls
off
belts
miles
in
extent
are
thus
killed
and
left
standing
with
the
branches
on
peeled
and
rigid
appearing
gray
in
the
distance
like
misty
clouds
later
the
branches
drop
off
leaving
a
forest
of
bleached
spars
at
length
the
roots
decay
and
the
forlorn
trunks
are
blown
down
during
some
storm
and
piled
one
upon
another
encumbering
the
ground
until
they
are
consumed
by
the
next
fire
and
leave
it
ready
for
a
fresh
crop
the
endurance
of
the
species
is
shown
by
its
wandering
occasionally
out
over
the
lava
plains
with
the
yellow
pine
and
climbing
moraineless
with
the
dwarf
pine
clinging
to
any
chance
support
in
rifts
and
crevices
of
however
showing
the
effects
of
such
hardships
in
every
feature
down
in
sheltered
lake
hollows
on
beds
of
rich
alluvium
it
varies
so
far
from
the
common
form
as
frequently
to
be
taken
for
a
distinct
species
here
it
grows
in
dense
sods
like
grasses
from
forty
to
eighty
feet
high
bending
all
together
to
the
breeze
and
whirling
in
eddying
gusts
more
lithely
than
any
other
tree
in
the
woods
i
have
frequently
found
specimens
fifty
feet
high
less
than
five
inches
in
diameter
being
thus
slender
and
at
the
same
time
well
clad
with
leafy
boughs
it
is
oftentimes
bent
to
the
ground
when
laden
with
soft
snow
forming
beautiful
arches
in
endless
variety
some
of
which
last
until
the
melting
of
the
snow
in
spring
mountain
pine
the
mountain
pine
is
king
of
the
alpine
woods
brave
hardy
and
towering
grandly
above
its
companions
and
becoming
stronger
and
more
imposing
just
where
other
species
begin
to
crouch
and
disappear
at
its
best
it
is
usually
about
ninety
feet
high
and
five
or
six
in
diameter
though
a
specimen

sierra
to
the
southern
portion
of
the
range
about
the
head
waters
of
kings
and
kern
rivers
where
it
forms
extensive
forests
and
in
some
places
accompanies
the
dwarf
pine
to
the
extreme
limit
of
it
is
first
met
at
an
elevation
of
between
and
feet
and
runs
up
to
without
seeming
to
suffer
greatly
from
the
climate
or
the
leanness
of
the
soil
it
is
a
much
finer
tree
than
the
dwarf
pine
instead
of
growing
in
clumps
and
low
heathy
mats
it
manages
in
some
way
to
maintain
an
erect
position
and
usually
stands
single
wherever
the
young
trees
are
at
all
sheltered
they
grow
up
straight
and
arrowy
with
delicately
tapered
bole
and
ascending
branches
terminated
with
glossy
tassels
at
middle
age
certain
limbs
are
specialized
and
pushed
far
out
for
the
bearing
of
cones
after
the
manner
of
the
sugar
pine
and
in
old
age
these
branches
droop
and
cast
about
in
every
direction
giving
rise
to
very
picturesque
effects
the
trunk
becomes
deep
brown
and
rough
like
that
of
the
mountain
pine
while
the
young
cones
are
of
a
strange
dull
color
clustered
on
the
upper
branches
when
ripe
they
are
from
three
to
four
inches
long
yellowish
brown
resembling
in
every
way
those
of
the
mountain
pine
excepting
the
sugar
pine
no
tree
on
the
mountains
is
so
capable
of
individual
expression
while
in
grace
of
form
and
movement
it
constantly
reminds
one
of
the
hemlock
spruce
illustration
oak
growing
among
yellow
pines
the
largest
specimen
i
measured
was
a
little
over
five
feet
in
diameter
and
ninety
feet
in
height
but
this
is
more
than
twice
the
ordinary
size
this
species
is
common
throughout
the
rocky
mountains
and
most
of
the
short
ranges
of
the
great
basin
where
it
is
called
the
pine
from
its
long
dense
on
the
hot
creek
white
pine
and
golden
gate
ranges
it
is
quite
abundant
about
a
foot
or
eighteen
inches
of
the
ends
of
the
branches
is
densely
packed
with
stiff
outstanding
needles
which
radiate
like
an
electric
fox
or
tail
the
needles
have
a
glossy
polish
and
the
sunshine
sifting
through
them
makes
them
burn
with
silvery
luster
while
their
number
and
elastic
temper
tell
delightfully
in
the
winds
this
tree
is
here
still
more
original
and
picturesque
than
in
the
sierra
far
surpassing
not
only
its
companion
conifers
in
this
respect
but
also
the
most
noted
of
the
lowland
oaks
some
stand
firmly
erect
feathered
with
radiant
tassels
down
to
the
ground
forming
slender
tapering
towers
of
shining
verdure
others
with
two
or
three
specialized
branches
pushed
out
at
right
angles
to
the
trunk
and
densely
clad
with
tasseled
sprays
take
the
form
of
beautiful
ornamental
crosses
again
in
the
same
woods
you
find
trees
that
are
made
up
of
several
boles
united
near
the
ground
spreading
at
the
sides
in
a
plane
parallel
to
the
axis
of
the
mountain
with
the
elegant
tassels
hung
in
charming
order
between
them
making
a
harp
held
against
the
main
wind
lines
where
they
are
most
effective
in
playing
the
grand
storm
harmonies
and
besides
these
there
are
many
variable
arching
forms
alone
or
in
groups
with
innumerable
tassels
drooping
beneath
the
arches
or
radiant
above
them
and
many
lowly
giants
of
no
particular
form
that
have
braved
the
storms
of
a
thousand
years
but
whether
old
or
young
sheltered
or
exposed
to
the
wildest
gales
this
tree
is
ever
found
irrepressibly
and
extravagantly
picturesque
and
offers
a
richer
and
more
varied
series
of
forms
to
the
artist
than
any
other
conifer
i
know
of
nut
pine
the
nut
pine
covers
or
rather
dots
the
eastern
flank
of
the
sierra
to
which
it
is
mostly
restricted
in
grayish
patches
from
the
margin
of
the
to
an
elevation
of
from
to
feet
a
more
contentedly
fruitful
and
unaspiring
conifer
could
not
be
conceived
all
the
species
we
have
been
sketching
make
departures
more
or
less
distant
from
the
typical
spire
form
but
none
goes
so
far
as
this
without
any
apparent
exigency
of
climate
or
soil
it
remains
near
the
ground
throwing
out
crooked
divergent
branches
like
an
orchard
and
seldom
pushes
a
single
shoot
higher
than
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
the
average
thickness
of
the
trunk
is
perhaps
about
ten
or
twelve
inches
the
leaves
are
mostly
undivided
like
round
awls
instead
of
being
separated
like
those
of
other
pines
into
twos
and
threes
and
fives
the
cones
are
green
while
growing
and
are
usually
found
over
all
the
tree
forming
quite
a
marked
feature
as
seen
against
the
foliage
they
are
quite
small
only
about
two
inches
in
length
and
give
no
promise
of
edible
nuts
but
when
we
come
to
open
them
we
find
that
about
half
the
entire
bulk
of
the
cone
is
made
up
of
sweet
nutritious
seeds
the
kernels
of
which
are
nearly
as
large
as
those
of
this
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
on
the
sierra
and
furnishes
the
mono
carson
and
walker
river
indians
with
more
and
better
nuts
than
all
the
other
species
taken
together
it
is
the
own
tree
and
many
a
white
man
have
they
killed
for
cutting
it
down
in
its
development
nature
seems
to
have
aimed
at
the
formation
of
as
great
a
surface
as
possible
being
so
low
and
accessible
the
cones
are
readily
beaten
off
with
poles
and
the
nuts
procured
by
roasting
them
until
the
scales
open
in
bountiful
seasons
a
single
indian
will
gather
thirty
or
forty
bushels
of
fine
squirrelish
employment
of
all
the
conifers
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
sierra
and
on
all
the
many
mountain
groups
and
short
ranges
of
the
great
basin
this
foodful
little
pine
is
the
commonest
tree
and
the
most
important
nearly
every
mountain
is
planted
with
it
to
a
height
of
from
to
feet
above
the
sea
some
are
covered
from
base
to
summit
by
this
one
species
with
only
a
sparse
growth
of
juniper
on
the
lower
slopes
to
break
the
continuity
of
its
curious
woods
which
though
at
a
distance
are
almost
shadeless
and
have
none
of
the
damp
leafy
glens
and
hollows
so
characteristic
of
other
pine
woods
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
occur
in
continuous
belts
indeed
viewed
comprehensively
the
entire
basin
seems
to
be
pretty
evenly
divided
into
level
plains
dotted
with
and
covered
with
nut
pines
no
slope
is
too
rough
none
too
dry
for
these
bountiful
orchards
of
the
red
man
the
value
of
this
species
to
nevada
is
not
easily
overestimated
it
furnishes
charcoal
and
timber
for
the
mines
and
with
the
juniper
supplies
the
ranches
with
fuel
and
rough
fencing
in
fruitful
seasons
the
nut
crop
is
perhaps
greater
than
the
california
wheat
crop
which
exerts
so
much
influence
throughout
the
food
markets
of
the
world
when
the
crop
is
ripe
the
indians
make
ready
the
long
bags
baskets
mats
and
sacks
are
collected
the
women
out
at
service
among
the
settlers
washing
or
drudging
assemble
at
the
family
huts
the
men
leave
their
ranch
work
old
and
young
all
are
mounted
on
ponies
and
start
in
great
glee
to
the
forming
curiously
picturesque
cavalcades
flaming
scarfs
and
calico
skirts
stream
loosely
over
the
knotty
ponies
two
squaws
usually
astride
of
each
with
baby
midgets
bandaged
in
baskets
slung
on
their
backs
or
balanced
on
the
while
and
project
from
each
side
and
the
long
make
angles
in
every
direction
arriving
at
some
central
point
where
grass
and
water
are
found
the
squaws
with
baskets
the
men
with
poles
ascend
the
ridges
to
the
laden
trees
followed
by
the
children
then
the
beating
begins
right
merrily
the
burs
fly
in
every
direction
rolling
down
the
slopes
lodging
here
and
there
against
rocks
and
chased
and
gathered
by
the
women
and
children
with
fine
natural
gladness
speedily
mark
the
joyful
scene
of
their
labors
as
the
are
kindled
and
at
night
assembled
in
gay
circles
garrulous
as
jays
they
begin
the
first
nut
feast
of
the
season
the
nuts
are
about
half
an
inch
long
and
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
diameter
pointed
at
the
top
round
at
the
base
light
brown
in
general
color
and
like
many
other
pine
seeds
handsomely
dotted
with
purple
like
eggs
the
shells
are
thin
and
may
be
crushed
between
the
thumb
and
finger
the
kernels
are
white
becoming
brown
by
roasting
and
are
sweet
to
every
palate
being
eaten
by
birds
squirrels
dogs
horses
and
men
perhaps
less
than
one
bushel
in
a
thousand
of
the
whole
crop
is
ever
gathered
still
besides
supplying
their
own
wants
in
times
of
plenty
the
indians
bring
large
quantities
to
market
then
they
are
eaten
around
nearly
every
fireside
in
the
state
and
are
even
fed
to
horses
occasionally
instead
of
barley
of
other
trees
growing
on
the
sierra
but
forming
a
very
small
part
of
the
general
forest
we
may
briefly
notice
the
following
is
a
magnificent
tree
in
the
coast
ranges
but
small
in
the
sierra
it
is
found
only
well
to
the
northward
along
the
banks
of
cool
streams
on
the
upper
sacramento
toward
mount
shasta
only
a
few
trees
of
this
species
as
far
as
i
have
seen
have
as
yet
gained
a
place
in
the
sierra
woods
it
has
evidently
been
derived
from
the
coast
range
by
way
of
the
tangle
of
connecting
mountains
at
the
head
of
the
sacramento
valley
in
shady
dells
and
on
cool
stream
banks
of
the
northern
sierra
we
also
find
the

the
interesting
nutmeg
tree
is
sparsely
distributed
along
the
western
flank
of
the

at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
mostly
in

small
prickly
leaved
glossy
evergreen
like
a
conifer
from
twenty
to
fifty
feet
high
and
one
to
two
feet
in
diameter
the
fruit
resembles
a
plum
and
contains
one
seed
about
the
size
of
an
acorn
and
like
a
nutmeg
hence
the
common
name
the
wood
is
and
of
a
beautiful
creamy
yellow
color
like
box
when
dry
though
the
green

the

seems
to
have
come
from

chapter
ix
the
douglas
squirrel
the
douglas
squirrel
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
and
influential
of
the
california
sciuridae
surpassing
every
other
species
in
force
of
character
numbers
and
extent
of
range
and
in
the
amount
of
influence
he
brings
to
bear
upon
the
health
and
distribution
of
the
vast
forests
he
inhabits
go
where
you
will
throughout
the
noble
woods
of
the
sierra
nevada
among
the
giant
pines
and
spruces
of
the
lower
zones
up
through
the
towering
silver
firs
to
the
thickets
of
the
summit
peaks
you
everywhere
find
this
little
squirrel
the
though
only
a
few
inches
long
so
intense
is
his
fiery
vigor
and
restlessness
he
stirs
every
grove
with
wild
life
and
makes
himself
more
important
than
even
the
huge
bears
that
shuffle
through
the
tangled
underbrush
beneath
him
every
wind
is
fretted
by
his
voice
almost
every
bole
and
branch
feels
the
sting
of
his
sharp
feet
how
much
the
growth
of
the
trees
is
stimulated
by
this
means
it
is
not
easy
to
learn
but
his
action
in
manipulating
their
seeds
is
more
appreciable
nature
has
made
him
master
forester
and
committed
most
of
her
coniferous
crops
to
his
paws
probably
over
fifty
per
cent
of
all
the
cones
ripened
on
the
sierra
are
cut
off
and
handled
by
the
douglas
alone
and
of
those
of
the
big
trees
perhaps
ninety
per
cent
pass
through
his
hands
the
greater
portion
is
of
course
stored
away
for
food
to
last
during
the
winter
and
spring
but
some
of
them
are
tucked
separately
into
loosely
covered
holes
where
some
of
the
seeds
germinate
and
become
trees
but
the
sierra
is
only
one
of
the
many
provinces
over
which
he
holds
sway
for
his
dominion
extends
over
all
the
redwood
belt
of
the
coast
mountains
and
far
northward
throughout
the
majestic
forests
of
oregon
washington
and
british
columbia
i
make
haste
to
mention
these
facts
to
show
upon
how
substantial
a
foundation
the
importance
i
ascribe
to
him
rests
the
douglas
is
closely
allied
to
the
red
squirrel
or
chickaree
of
the
eastern
woods
ours
may
be
a
lineal
descendant
of
this
species
distributed
westward
to
the
pacific
by
way
of
the
great
lakes
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
thence
southward
along
our
forested
ranges
this
view
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
our
species
becomes
redder
and
more
in
general
the
farther
it
is
traced
back
along
the
course
indicated
above
but
whatever
their
relationship
and
the
evolutionary
forces
that
have
acted
upon
them
the
douglas
is
now
the
larger
and
more
beautiful
animal
from
the
nose
to
the
root
of
the
tail
he
measures
about
eight
inches
and
his
tail
which
he
so
effectively
uses
in
interpreting
his
feelings
is
about
six
inches
in
length
he
wears
dark
over
the
back
and
down
the
sides
bright
buff
on
the
belly
with
a
stripe
of
dark
gray
nearly
black
separating
the
upper
and
under
colors
this
dividing
stripe
however
is
not
very
sharply
defined
he
has
long
black
whiskers
which
gives
him
a
rather
fierce
look
when
observed
closely
strong
claws
sharp
as
and
the
brightest
of
bright
eyes
full
of
telling
speculation
a
river
indian
told
me
that
they
call
him
which
rapidly
pronounced
with
the
first
syllable
heavily
accented
is
not
unlike
the
lusty
exclamation
he
utters
on
his
way
up
a
tree
when
excited
most
mountaineers
in
california
call
him
the
pine
squirrel
and
when
i
asked
an
old
trapper
whether
he
knew
our
little
forester
he
replied
with
brightening
countenance
yes
of
course
i
know
him
everybody
knows
him
when
in
the
woods
i
often
find
out
where
the
deer
are
by
his
at
i
call
squirrels
because
so
mighty
quick
and
all
the
true
squirrels
are
more
or
less
birdlike
in
speech
and
movements
but
the
douglas
is
preëminently
so
possessing
as
he
does
every
attribute
peculiarly
squirrelish
enthusiastically
concentrated
he
is
the
squirrel
of
squirrels
flashing
from
branch
to
branch
of
his
favorite
evergreens
crisp
and
glossy
and
undiseased
as
a
sunbeam
give
him
wings
and
he
would
outfly
any
bird
in
the
woods
his
big
gray
cousin
is
a
looser
animal
seemingly
light
enough
to
float
on
the
wind
yet
when
leaping
from
limb
to
limb
or
out
of
one
to
another
he
sometimes
halts
to
gather
strength
as
if
making
efforts
concerning
the
upshot
of
which
he
does
not
always
feel
exactly
confident
but
the
douglas
with
his
denser
body
leaps
and
glides
in
hidden
strength
seemingly
as
independent
of
common
muscles
as
a
mountain
stream
he
threads
the
tasseled
branches
of
the
pines
stirring
their
needles
like
a
rustling
breeze
now
shooting
across
openings
in
arrowy
lines
now
launching
in
curves
glinting
deftly
from
side
to
side
in
sudden
zigzags
and
swirling
in
giddy
loops
and
spirals
around
the
knotty
trunks
getting
into
what
seem
to
be
the
most
impossible
situations
without
sense
of
danger
now
on
his
haunches
now
on
his
head
yet
ever
graceful
and
punctuating
his
most
irrepressible
outbursts
of
energy
with
little
dots
and
dashes
of
perfect
repose
he
is
without
exception
the
wildest
animal
i
ever
saw
fiery
sputtering
little
bolt
of
life
luxuriating
in
quick
oxygen
and
the
best
juices
one
can
hardly
think
of
such
a
creature
being
dependent
like
the
rest
of
us
on
climate
and
food
but
after
all
it
requires
no
long
acquaintance
to
learn
he
is
human
for
he
works
for
a
living
his
busiest
time
is
in
the
indian
summer
then
he
gathers
burs
and
like
a
plodding
farmer
working
continuously
every
day
for
hours
saying
not
a
word
cutting
off
the
ripe
cones
at
the
top
of
his
speed
as
if
employed
by
the
job
and
examining
every
branch
in
regular
order
as
if
careful
that
not
one
should
escape
him
then
descending
he
stores
them
away
beneath
logs
and
stumps
in
anticipation
of
the
pinching
hunger
days
of
winter
he
seems
himself
a
kind
of
coniferous
fruit
fruit
and
flower
the
resiny
essences
of
the
pines
pervade
every
pore
of
his
body
and
eating
his
flesh
is
like
chewing
gum
one
never
tires
of
this
bright
chip
of
nature
brave
little
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
observing
his
many
works
and
ways
and
listening
to
his
curious
language
his
musical
piny
gossip
is
as
savory
to
the
ear
as
balsam
to
the
palate
and
though
he
has
not
exactly
the
gift
of
song
some
of
his
notes
are
as
sweet
as
those
of
a
in
softness
while
others
prick
and
tingle
like
thistles
he
is
the
of
squirrels
pouring
forth
mixed
chatter
and
song
like
a
perennial
fountain
barking
like
a
dog
screaming
like
a
hawk
chirping
like
a
blackbird
or
a
sparrow
while
in
bluff
audacious
noisiness
he
is
a
very
jay
illustration
track
of
douglas
squirrel
once
down
and
up
a
when
showing
off
to
a
spectator
in
descending
the
trunk
of
a
tree
with
the
intention
of
alighting
on
the
ground
he
preserves
a
cautious
silence
mindful
perhaps
of
foxes
and
wildcats
but
while
rocking
safely
at
home
in
the
there
is
no
end
to
his
capers
and
noise
and
woe
to
the
gray
squirrel
or
chipmunk
that
ventures
to
set
foot
on
his
favorite
tree
no
matter
how
slyly
they
trace
the
furrows
of
the
bark
they
are
speedily
discovered
and
kicked
with
comic
vehemence
while
a
torrent
of
angry
notes
comes
rushing
from
his
whiskered
lips
that
sounds
remarkably
like
swearing
he
will
even
attempt
at
times
to
drive
away
dogs
and
men
especially
if
he
has
had
no
previous
knowledge
of
them
seeing
a
man
for
the
first
time
he
approaches
nearer
and
nearer
until
within
a
few
feet
then
with
an
angry
outburst
he
makes
a
sudden
rush
all
teeth
and
eyes
as
if
about
to
eat
you
up
but
finding
that
the
big
forked
animal
scare
he
prudently
beats
a
retreat
and
sets
himself
up
to
reconnoiter
on
some
overhanging
branch
scrutinizing
every
movement
you
make
with
ludicrous
solemnity
gathering
courage
he
ventures
down
the
trunk
again
churring
and
chirping
and
jerking
nervously
up
and
down
in
curious
loops
eyeing
you
all
the
time
as
if
snowing
off
and
demanding
your
admiration
finally
growing
calmer
he
settles
down
in
a
comfortable
posture
on
some
horizontal
branch
commanding
a
good
view
and
beats
time
with
his
tail
to
a
steady
or
when
somewhat
less
excited
with
the
first
syllable
keenly
accented
and
the
second
drawn
out
like
the
scream
of
a
hawk
this
slowly
and
more
emphatically
at
first
then
gradually
faster
until
a
rate
of
about
words
a
minute
is
reached
usually
sitting
all
the
time
on
his
haunches
with
paws
resting
on
his
breast
which
pulses
visibly
with
each
word
it
is
remarkable
too
that
though
articulating
distinctly
he
keeps
his
mouth
shut
most
of
the
time
and
speaks
through
his
nose
i
have
occasionally
observed
him
even
eating
sequoia
seeds
and
nibbling
a
troublesome
flea
without
ceasing
or
in
any
way
confusing
his
for
a
single
moment
while
ascending
trees
all
his
claws
come
into
play
but
in
descending
the
weight
of
his
body
is
sustained
chiefly
by
those
of
the
hind
feet
still
in
neither
case
do
his
movements
suggest
effort
though
if
you
are
near
enough
you
may
see
the
bulging
strength
of
his
short
arms
and
note
his
sinewy
fists
clinched
in
the
bark
whether
going
up
or
down
he
carries
his
tail
extended
at
full
length
in
line
with
his
body
unless
it
be
required
for
gestures
but
while
running
along
horizontal
limbs
or
fallen
trunks
it
is
frequently
folded
forward
over
the
back
with
the
airy
tip
daintily
upcurled
in
cool
weather
it
keeps
him
warm
then
after
he
has
finished
his
meal
you
may
see
him
crouched
close
on
some
level
limb
with
his
neatly
spread
and
reaching
forward
to
his
ears
the
electric
outstanding
hairs
quivering
in
the
breeze
like
but
in
wet
or
very
cold
weather
he
stays
in
his
nest
and
while
curled
up
there
his
comforter
is
long
enough
to
come
forward
around
his
nose
it
is
seldom
so
cold
however
as
to
prevent
his
going
out
to
his
stores
when
hungry
once
as
i
lay
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
timber
line
on
mount
shasta
the
thermometer
nearly
at
zero
and
the
sky
thick
with
driving
snow
a
douglas
came
bravely
out
several
times
from
one
of
the
lower
hollows
of
a
dwarf
pine
near
my
camp
faced
the
wind
without
seeming
to
feel
it
much
frisked
lightly
about
over
the
mealy
snow
and
dug
his
way
down
to
some
hidden
seeds
with
wonderful
precision
as
if
to
his
eyes
the
thick
were
glass
no
other
of
the
sierra
animals
of
my
acquaintance
is
better
fed
not
even
the
deer
amid
abundance
of
sweet
herbs
and
shrubs
or
the
mountain
sheep
or
omnivorous
bears
his
food
consists
of
berries
chinquapins
and
the
nuts
and
seeds
of
all
the
coniferous
trees
without
exception
fir
spruce
libocedrus
juniper
and
sequoia
is
fond
of
them
all
and
they
all
agree
with
him
green
or
ripe
no
cone
is
too
large
for
him
to
manage
none
so
small
as
to
be
beneath
his
notice
the
smaller
ones
such
as
those
of
the
hemlock
and
the
douglas
spruce
and
the
pine
he
cuts
off
and
eats
on
a
branch
of
the
tree
without
allowing
them
to
fall
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
cone
and
cutting
away
the
scales
to
expose
the
seeds
not
gnawing
by
guess
like
a
bear
but
turning
them
round
and
round
in
regular
order
in
compliance
with
their
spiral
arrangement
when
thus
employed
his
location
in
the
tree
is
betrayed
by
a
dribble
of
scales
shells
and
and
every
few
minutes
by
the
fall
of
the
stripped
axis
of
the
cone
then
of
course
he
is
ready
for
another
and
if
you
are
watching
you
may
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
glides
silently
out
to
the
end
of
a
branch
and
see
him
examining
the
until
he
finds
one
to
his
mind
then
leaning
over
pull
back
the
springy
needles
out
of
his
way
grasp
the
cone
with
his
paws
to
prevent
its
falling
snip
it
off
in
an
incredibly
short
time
seize
it
with
jaws
grotesquely
stretched
and
return
to
his
chosen
seat
near
the
trunk
but
the
immense
size
of
the
cones
of
the
sugar
fifteen
to
twenty
inches
in
those
of
the
jeffrey
variety
of
the
yellow
pine
compel
him
to
adopt
a
quite
different
method
he
cuts
them
off
without
attempting
to
hold
them
then
goes
down
and
drags
them
from
where
they
have
chanced
to
fall
up
to
the
bare
swelling
ground
around
the
instep
of
the
tree
where
he
demolishes
them
in
the
same
methodical
way
beginning
at
the
bottom
and
following
the
to
the
top
illustration
seeds
wings
and
scale
of
sugar
pine
nat
size
from
a
single
sugar
pine
cone
he
gets
from
two
to
four
hundred
seeds
about
half
the
size
of
a
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
can
procure
enough
to
last
a
week
he
seems
however
to
prefer
those
of
the
two
silver
first
above
all
others
perhaps
because
they
are
most
easily
obtained
as
the
scales
drop
off
when
ripe
without
needing
to
be
cut
both
species
are
filled
with
an
exceedingly
pungent
aromatic
oil
which
spices
all
his
flesh
and
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
account
for
his
lightning
energy
you
may
easily
know
this
little
workman
by
his
chips
on
sunny
hillsides
around
the
principal
trees
they
lie
in
big
piles
and
basketfuls
of
them
all
fresh
and
clean
making
the
most
beautiful
imaginable
the
brown
and
yellow
scales
and
are
as
abundant
and
as
delicately
penciled
and
tinted
as
the
shells
along
the
while
the
beautiful
red
and
purple
mingled
with
them
would
lead
one
to
fancy
that
innumerable
butterflies
had
there
met
their
fate
he
feasts
on
all
the
species
long
before
they
are
ripe
but
is
wise
enough
to
wait
until
they
are
matured
before
he
gathers
them
into
his
barns
this
is
in
october
and
november
which
with
him
are
the
two
busiest
months
of
the
year
all
kinds
of
burs
big
and
little
are
now
cut
off
and
showered
down
alike
and
the
ground
is
speedily
covered
with
them
a
constant
thudding
and
bumping
is
kept
up
some
of
the
larger
cones
chancing
to
fall
on
old
logs
make
the
forest
reëcho
with
the
sound
other
less
industrious
know
well
what
is
going
on
and
hasten
to
carry
away
the
cones
as
they
fall
but
however
busy
the
harvester
may
be
he
is
not
slow
to
descry
the
pilferers
below
and
instantly
leaves
his
work
to
drive
them
away
the
little
striped
tamias
is
a
thorn
in
his
flesh
stealing
persistently
punish
him
as
he
may
the
large
gray
squirrel
gives
trouble
also
although
the
douglas
has
been
accused
of
stealing
from
him
generally
however
just
the
opposite
is
the
case
the
excellence
of
the
sierra
evergreens
is
well
known
to
nurserymen
throughout
the
world
consequently
there
is
considerable
demand
for
the
seeds
the
greater
portion
of
the
supply
has
hitherto
been
procured
by
chopping
down
the
trees
in
the
more
accessible
sections
of
the
forest
alongside
of
that
cross
the
range
sequoia
seeds
at
first
brought
from
twenty
to
thirty
dollars
per
pound
and
therefore
were
eagerly
sought
after
some
of
the
smaller
fruitful
trees
were
cut
down
in
the
groves
not
protected
by
government
especially
those
of
fresno
and
river
most
of
the
sequoias
however
are
of
so
gigantic
a
size
that
the
seedsmen
have
to
look
for
the
greater
portion
of
their
supplies
to
the
douglas
who
soon
learns
he
is
no
match
for
these
freebooters
he
is
wise
enough
however
to
cease
working
the
instant
he
perceives
them
and
never
fails
to
embrace
every
opportunity
to
recover
his
burs
whenever
they
happen
to
be
stored
in
any
place
accessible
to
him
and
the
busy
seedsman
often
finds
on
returning
to
camp
that
the
little
douglas
has
exhaustively
spoiled
the
spoiler
i
know
one
who
whenever
he
robs
the
squirrels
scatters
wheat
or
barley
beneath
the
trees
as
the
want
of
appreciable
life
remarked
by
so
many
travelers
in
the
sierra
forests
is
never
felt
at
this
time
of
year
banish
all
the
humming
insects
and
the
birds
and
quadrupeds
leaving
only
sir
douglas
and
the
most
solitary
of
our
solitudes
would
still
throb
with
ardent
life
but
if
you
should
go
impatiently
even
into
the
most
populous
of
the
groves
on
purpose
to
meet
him
and
walk
about
looking
up
among
the
branches
you
would
see
very
little
of
him
but
lie
down
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
trees
and
straightway
he
will
come
for
in
the
midst
of
the
ordinary
forest
sounds
the
falling
of
burs
piping
of
quails
the
screaming
of
the
clark
crow
and
the
rustling
of
deer
and
bears
among
the
chaparral
he
is
quick
to
detect
your
strange
footsteps
and
will
hasten
to
make
a
good
close
inspection
of
you
as
soon
as
you
are
still
first
you
may
hear
him
sounding
a
few
notes
of
curious
inquiry
but
more
likely
the
first
intimation
of
his
approach
will
be
the
prickly
sounds
of
his
feet
as
he
descends
the
tree
overhead
just
before
he
makes
his
savage
onrush
to
frighten
you
and
proclaim
your
presence
to
every
squirrel
and
bird
in
the
neighborhood
if
you
remain
perfectly
motionless
he
will
come
nearer
and
nearer
and
probably
set
your
flesh
by
frisking
across
your
body
once
while
i
was
seated
at
the
foot
of
a
hemlock
spruce
in
one
of
the
most
inaccessible
of
the
san
joaquin
yosemites
engaged
in
sketching
a
reckless
fellow
came
up
behind
me
passed
under
my
bended
arm
and
jumped
on
my
paper
and
one
warm
afternoon
while
an
old
friend
of
mine
was
reading
out
in
the
shade
of
his
cabin
one
of
his
douglas
neighbors
jumped
from
the
gable
upon
his
head
and
then
with
admirable
assurance
ran
down
over
his
shoulder
and
on
to
the
book
he
held
in
his
hand
our
douglas
enjoys
a
large
social
circle
for
besides
his
numerous
relatives
fossor
tamias
quadrivitatus
townsendii
spermophilus
beccheyi
he
maintains
intimate
relations
with
the
birds
particularly
the
clark
crow
and
the
numerous
woodpeckers
and
jays
the
two
spermophiles
are
astonishingly
abundant
in
the
lowlands
and
lower
but
more
and
more
sparingly
distributed
up
through
the
douglas
domains
venturing
higher
than
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
gray
sciurus
ranges
but
little
higher
than
this
the
little
striped
tamias
alone
is
associated
with
him
everywhere
in
the
lower
and
middle
zones
where
they
all
meet
they
are
tolerably
happy
family
though
very
amusing
skirmishes
may
occasionally
be
witnessed
wherever
the
ancient
glaciers
have
spread
forest
soil
there
you
find
our
wee
hero
most
abundant
where
depth
of
soil
and
genial
climate
have
given
rise
to
a
corresponding
luxuriance
in
the
trees
but
following
every
kind
of
growth
up
the
curving
moraines
to
the
highest
glacial
fountains
though
i
can
not
of
course
expect
all
my
readers
to
sympathize
fully
in
my
admiration
of
this
little
animal
few
i
hope
will
think
this
sketch
of
his
life
too
long
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
here
how
much
he
has
cheered
my
lonely
wanderings
during
all
the
years
i
have
been
pursuing
my
studies
in
these
glorious
wilds
or
how
much
unmistakable
humanity
i
have
found
in
him
take
this
for
example
one
calm
creamy
indian
summer
morning
when
the
nuts
were
ripe
i
was
camped
in
the
upper
of
the
south
fork
of
the
san
joaquin
where
the
squirrels
seemed
to
be
about
as
plentiful
as
the
ripe
burs
they
were
taking
an
early
breakfast
before
going
to
their
regular
while
i
was
busy
with
my
own
breakfast
i
heard
the
thudding
fall
of
two
or
three
heavy
cones
from
a
yellow
pine
near
me
i
stole
noiselessly
forward
within
about
twenty
feet
of
the
base
of
it
to
observe
in
a
few
moments
down
came
the
douglas
the
he
had
cut
off
had
rolled
on
the
gently
sloping
ground
into
a
clump
of
ceanothus
bushes
but
he
seemed
to
know
exactly
where
they
were
for
he
found
them
at
once
apparently
without
searching
for
them
they
were
more
than
twice
as
heavy
as
himself
but
after
turning
them
into
the
right
position
for
getting
a
good
hold
with
his
long
he
managed
to
drag
them
up
to
the
foot
of
the
tree
from
which
he
had
cut
them
moving
backward
then
seating
himself
comfortably
he
held
them
on
end
bottom
up
and
demolished
them
at
his
ease
a
good
deal
of
nibbling
had
to
be
done
before
he
got
anything
to
eat
because
the
lower
scales
are
barren
but
when
he
had
patiently
worked
his
way
up
to
the
fertile
ones
he
found
two
sweet
nuts
at
the
base
of
each
shaped
like
trimmed
hams
and
spotted
purple
like
eggs
and
notwithstanding
these
cones
were
dripping
with
soft
balsam
and
covered
with
prickles
and
so
strongly
put
together
that
a
boy
would
be
puzzled
to
cut
them
open
with
a
he
accomplished
his
meal
with
easy
dignity
and
cleanliness
making
less
effort
apparently
than
a
man
would
in
eating
soft
cookery
from
a
plate
breakfast
done
i
whistled
a
tune
for
him
before
he
went
to
work
curious
to
see
how
he
would
be
affected
by
it
he
had
not
seen
me
all
this
while
but
the
instant
i
began
to
whistle
he
darted
up
the
tree
nearest
to
him
and
came
out
on
a
small
dead
limb
opposite
me
and
composed
himself
to
listen
i
sang
and
whistled
more
than
a
dozen
airs
and
as
the
music
changed
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
turned
his
head
quickly
from
side
to
side
but
made
no
other
response
other
squirrels
hearing
the
strange
sounds
came
around
on
all
sides
also
chipmunks
and
birds
one
of
the
birds
a
handsome
thrush
seemed
even
more
interested
than
the
squirrels
after
listening
for
awhile
on
one
of
the
lower
dead
sprays
of
a
pine
he
came
swooping
forward
within
a
few
feet
of
my
face
and
remained
fluttering
in
the
air
for
half
a
minute
or
so
sustaining
himself
with
whirring
like
a
in
front
of
a
flower
while
i
could
look
into
his
eyes
and
see
his
innocent
wonder
by
this
time
my
performance
must
have
lasted
nearly
half
an
hour
i
sang
or
whistled
boon
gowrie
the
water
to
charlie
woods
cragie
lee
all
of
which
seemed
to
be
listened
to
with
bright
interest
my
first
douglas
sitting
patiently
through
it
all
with
his
telling
eyes
fixed
upon
me
until
i
ventured
to
give
the
hundredth
when
he
screamed
his
indian
name
pillillooeet
turned
tail
and
darted
with
ludicrous
haste
up
the
tree
out
of
sight
his
voice
and
actions
in
the
case
leaving
a
somewhat
profane
impression
as
if
he
had
said
be
hanged
if
you
get
me
to
hear
anything
so
solemn
and
this
acted
as
a
signal
for
the
general
dispersal
of
the
whole
hairy
tribe
though
the
birds
seemed
willing
to
wait
further
developments
music
being
naturally
more
in
their
line
what
there
can
be
in
that
grand
old
that
is
so
offensive
to
birds
and
squirrels
i
imagine
a
year
or
two
after
this
high
sierra
concert
i
was
sitting
one
fine
day
on
a
hill
in
the
coast
range
where
the
common
ground
squirrels
were
abundant
they
were
very
shy
on
account
of
being
hunted
so
much
but
after
i
had
been
silent
and
motionless
for
half
an
hour
or
so
they
began
to
venture
out
of
their
holes
and
to
feed
on
the
seeds
of
the
grasses
and
thistles
around
me
as
if
i
were
no
more
to
be
feared
than
a
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
was
a
good
opportunity
to
find
out
whether
they
also
disliked
therefore
i
began
to
whistle
as
nearly
as
i
could
remember
the
same
familiar
airs
that
had
pleased
the
mountaineers
of
the
sierra
they
at
once
stopped
eating
stood
erect
and
listened
patiently
until
i
came
to
hundredth
when
with
ludicrous
haste
every
one
of
them
rushed
to
their
holes
and
bolted
in
their
feet
twinkling
in
the
air
for
a
moment
as
they
vanished
no
one
who
makes
the
acquaintance
of
our
forester
will
fail
to
admire
him
but
he
is
far
too
and
warlike
ever
to
be
taken
for
a
darling
how
long
the
life
of
a

squirrel
may
be

the
young

to
sprout

from
the

as
enduring
as
their

trees
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
realize
that
so
condensed
a
piece
of
should
ever
become
dim
or
die
at
all
he
is
seldom
killed
by
hunters
for
he
is
too
small
to
encourage
much
of
their
attention
and
when
pursued
in
settled
regions
becomes
excessively
shy
and
keeps
close
in
the
furrows
of
the
highest
trunks
many
of
which
are
of
the
same
color
as
himself

prey
to

occasionally
he
is
pursued
by

and

but
upon
the
whole
he
dwells
safely
in
the
deep
bosom
of
the

favored
of

by
the

after
one
has
seen
pines
six
feet
in

bending
like
grasses
before
a
mountain
gale
and
ever
and
anon
some
giant
falling
with
a
crash
that
shakes
the
hills
it
seems
astonishing
that
any
save
the
lowest
thickset
trees
could
ever
have
found
a
period
sufficiently
stormless
to
establish
themselves
or
once
established
that
they
should
not
sooner
or
later
have
been
blown
down
but
when
the
storm
is
over
and
we
behold
the
same
forests
tranquil
again
towering
fresh
and
unscathed
in
erect
majesty
and
consider
what
centuries
of
storms
have
fallen
upon
them
since
they
were
first
planted
to
break
the
tender
seedlings
lightning
to
scorch

shatter

winds
and
avalanches
to
crush
and
overwhelm
the
manifest
result
of
all
this

the

perfection
we
behold
then
faith

forestry

established
and
we
cease
to
deplore
the
violence
of
her
most
destructive
gales
or
of
any
other
whatsoever
there
are
two
trees
in
the
sierra
forests
that
are
never
blown
down
so
long
as
they
continue
in
sound
health
these
are
the
juniper
and
the
dwarf
pine
of
the
summit
peaks
their
stiff
crooked
roots
grip
the
ledges
like
claws
while
their
lithe
branches
bend
round
compliantly
offering
but
slight
holds
for
winds
however
violent
the
other
alpine
needle
pine
mountain
pine
pine
and
hemlock
never
thinned
out
by
this
agent
to
any
destructive
extent
on
account
of
their
admirable
toughness
and
the
closeness
of
their
growth
in
general
the
same
is
true
of
the
giants
of
the
lower
zones
the
kingly
sugar
pine
towering
aloft
to
a
height
of
more
than
feet
offers
a
fine
mark
to
but
it
is
not
densely
foliaged
and
its
long
horizontal
arms
swing
round
compliantly
in
the
blast
like
tresses
of
green
fluent
algae
in
a
brook
while
the
silver
firs
in
most
places
keep
their
ranks
well
together
in
united
strength
the
yellow
or
silver
pine
is
more
frequently
overturned
than
any
other
tree
on
the
sierra
because
its
leaves
and
branches
form
a
larger
mass
in
proportion
to
its
height
while
in
many
places
it
is
planted
sparsely
leaving
open
lanes
through
which
storms
may
enter
with
full
force
furthermore
because
it
is
distributed
along
the
lower
portion
of
the
range
which
was
the
first
to
be
left
bare
on
the
breaking
up
of
the
at
the
close
of
the
glacial
winter
the
soil
it
is
growing
upon
has
been
longer
exposed
to
weathering
and
consequently
is
in
a
more
crumbling
decayed
condition
than
the
fresher
soils
farther
up
the
range
and
therefore
offers
a
less
secure
anchorage
for
the
roots
while
exploring
the
forest
zones
of
mount
shasta
i
discovered
the
path
of
a
hurricane
strewn
with
thousands
of
pines
of
this
species
great
and
small
had
been
uprooted
or
wrenched
off
by
sheer
force
making
a
clean
gap
like
that
made
by
a
snow
avalanche
but
hurricanes
capable
of
doing
this
class
of
work
are
rare
in
the
sierra
and
when
we
have
explored
the
forests
from
one
extremity
of
the
range
to
the
other
we
are
compelled
to
believe
that
they
are
the
most
beautiful
on
the
face
of
the
earth
however
we
may
regard
the
agents
that
have
made
them
so
there
is
always
something
deeply
exciting
not
only
in
the
sounds
of
winds
in
the
woods
which
exert
more
or
less
influence
over
every
mind
but
in
their
varied
waterlike
flow
as
manifested
by
the
movements
of
the
trees
especially
those
of
the
conifers
by
no
other
trees
are
they
rendered
so
extensively
and
impressively
visible
not
even
by
the
lordly
tropic
palms
or
responsive
to
the
gentlest
breeze
the
waving
of
a
forest
of
the
giant
sequoias
is
indescribably
impressive
and
sublime
but
the
pines
seem
to
me
the
best
interpreters
of
winds
they
are
mighty
waving
goldenrods
ever
in
tune
singing
and
writing
all
their
long
century
lives
little
however
of
this
noble
and
will
you
see
or
hear
in
the
strictly
alpine
portion
of
the
forests
the
burly
juniper
whose
girth
sometimes
more
than
equals
its
height
is
about
as
rigid
as
the
rocks
on
which
it
grows
the
slender
sprays
of
the
dwarf
pine
stream
out
in
wavering
ripples
but
the
tallest
and
slenderest
are
far
too
unyielding
to
wave
even
in
the
heaviest
gales
they
only
shake
in
quick
short
vibrations

some
of

tallest

bow
in
storms
with
considerable
scope
and
gracefulness
but
it
is
only
in
the
lower
and
middle
zones
that
the
meeting
of
winds
and
woods
is
to
be
seen
in
all
its
grandeur
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
exhilarating
storms
i
ever
enjoyed
in
the
sierra
occurred
in
december
when
i
happened
to
be
exploring
one
of
the
tributary
valleys
of
the
yuba
river
the
sky
and
the
ground
and
the
trees
had
been
thoroughly
and
were
dry
again
the
day
was
intensely
pure
one
of
those
incomparable
bits
of
california
winter
warm
and
balmy
and
full
of
white
sparkling
sunshine
redolent
of
all
the
purest
influences
of
the
spring
and
at
the
same
time
enlivened
with
one
of
the
most
bracing
conceivable
instead
of
camping
out
as
i
usually
do
i
then
chanced
to
be
stopping
at
the
house
of
a
friend
but
when
the
storm
began
to
sound
i
lost
no
time
in
pushing
out
into
the
woods
to
enjoy
it
for
on
such
occasions
nature
has
always
something
rare
to
show
us
and
the
danger
to
life
and
limb
is
hardly
greater
than
one
would
experience
crouching
deprecatingly
beneath
a
roof
it
was
still
early
morning
when
i
found
myself
fairly
adrift
delicious
sunshine
came
pouring
over
the
hills
lighting
the
tops
of
the
pines
and
setting
free
a
steam
of
summery
fragrance
that
contrasted
strangely
with
the
wild
tones
of
the
storm
the
air
was
mottled
with
and
bright
green
plumes
that
went
flashing
past
in
the
sunlight
like
birds
pursued
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
dustiness
nothing
less
pure
than
leaves
and
ripe
pollen
and
flecks
of
withered
bracken
and
moss
i
heard
trees
falling
for
hours
at
the
rate
of
one
every
two
or
three
minutes
some
uprooted
partly
on
account
of
the
loose
condition
of
the
ground
others
broken
straight
across
where
some
weakness
caused
by
fire
had
determined
the
spot
the
gestures
of
the
various
trees
made
a
delightful
study
young
sugar
pines
light
and
feathery
as
were
bowing
almost
to
the
ground
while
the
grand
old
patriarchs
whose
massive
boles
had
been
tried
in
a
hundred
storms
waved
solemnly
above
them
their
long
arching
branches
streaming
fluently
on
the
gale
and
every
needle
thrilling
and
ringing
and
shedding
off
keen
lances
of
light
like
a
diamond
the
douglas
spruces
with
long
sprays
drawn
out
in
level
tresses
and
needles
massed
in
a
gray
shimmering
glow
presented
a
most
striking
appearance
as
they
stood
in
bold
relief
along
the
hilltops
the
madroños
in
the
dells
with
their
red
bark
and
large
glossy
leaves
tilted
every
way
reflected
the
sunshine
in
throbbing
spangles
like
those
one
so
often
sees
on
the
rippled
surface
of
a
glacier
lake
but
the
silver
pines
were
now
the
most
impressively
beautiful
of
all
colossal
spires
feet
in
height
waved
like
supple
chanting
and
bowing
low
as
if
in
worship
while
the
whole
mass
of
their
long
tremulous
foliage
was
kindled
into
one
continuous
blaze
of
white
the
force
of
the
gale
was
such
that
the
most
steadfast
monarch
of
them
all
rocked
down
to
its
roots
with
a
motion
plainly
perceptible
when
one
leaned
against
it
nature
was
holding
high
festival
and
every
fiber
of
the
most
rigid
giants
thrilled
with
glad
excitement
i
drifted
on
through
the
midst
of
this
passionate
music
and
motion
across
many
a
glen
from
ridge
to
ridge
often
halting
in
the
lee
of
a
rock
for
shelter
or
to
gaze
and
listen
even
when
the
grand
anthem
had
swelled
to
its
highest
pitch
i
could
distinctly
hear
the
varying
tones
of
individual
trees
and
fir
and
pine
and
leafless
oak
even
the
infinitely
gentle
rustle
of
the
withered
grasses
at
my
feet
each
was
expressing
itself
in
its
own
way
its
own
song
and
making
its
own
peculiar
gestures
a
richness
of
variety
to
be
found
in
no
other
forest
i
have
yet
seen
the
coniferous
woods
of
canada
and
the
carolinas
and
florida
are
made
up
of
trees
that
resemble
one
another
about
as
nearly
as
blades
of
grass
and
grow
close
together
in
much
the
same
way
coniferous
trees
in
general
seldom
possess
individual
character
such
as
is
manifest
among
oaks
and
elms
but
the
california
forests
are
made
up
of
a
greater
number
of
distinct
species
than
any
other
in
the
world
and
in
them
we
find
not
only
a
marked
differentiation
into
special
groups
but
also
a
marked
individuality
in
almost
every
tree
giving
rise
to
storm
effects
indescribably
glorious
toward
midday
after
a
long
tingling
scramble
through
copses
of
hazel
and
ceanothus
i
gained
the
summit
of
the
highest
ridge
in
the
neighborhood
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
climb
one
of
the
trees
to
obtain
a
wider
outlook
and
get
my
ear
close
to
the
aeolian
music
of
its
topmost
needles
but
under
the
circumstances
the
choice
of
a
tree
was
a
serious
matter
one
whose
instep
was
not
very
strong
seemed
in
danger
of
being
blown
down
or
of
being
struck
by
others
in
case
they
should
fall
another
was
branchless
to
a
considerable
height
above
the
ground
and
at
the
same
time
too
large
to
be
grasped
with
arms
and
legs
in
climbing
while
others
were
not
favorably
situated
for
clear
views
after
cautiously
casting
about
i
made
choice
of
the
tallest
of
a
group
of
douglas
spruces
that
were
growing
close
together
like
a
tuft
of
grass
no
one
of
which
seemed
likely
to
fall
unless
all
the
rest
fell
with
it
though
comparatively
young
they
were
about
feet
high
and
their
lithe
brushy
tops
were
rocking
and
swirling
in
wild
ecstasy
being
accustomed
to
climb
trees
in
making
botanical
studies
i
experienced
no
difficulty
in
reaching
the
top
of
this
one
and
never
before
did
i
enjoy
so
noble
an
exhilaration
of
motion
the
slender
tops
fairly
flapped
and
swished
in
the
passionate
torrent
bending
and
swirling
backward
and
forward
round
and
round
tracing
indescribable
combinations
of
vertical
and
horizontal
curves
while
i
clung
with
muscles
firm
braced
like
a
bobolink
on
a
reed
illustration
yellow
pine
and
libocedrus
the
two
inside
trees
are
libocedrus
the
two
outside
trees
yellow
pine
in
its
widest
sweeps
my
described
an
arc
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
degrees
but
i
felt
sure
of
its
elastic
temper
having
seen
others
of
the
same
species
still
more
severely
almost
to
the
ground
indeed
in
heavy
breaking
a
fiber
i
was
therefore
safe
and
free
to
take
the
wind
into
my
pulses
and
enjoy
the
excited
forest
from
my
superb
outlook
the
view
from
here
must
be
extremely
beautiful
in
any
weather
now
my
eye
roved
over
the
piny
hills
and
dales
as
over
fields
of
waving
grain
and
felt
the
light
running
in
ripples
and
broad
swelling
undulations
across
the
valleys
from
ridge
to
ridge
as
the
shining
foliage
was
stirred
by
corresponding
waves
of
air
oftentimes
these
waves
of
reflected
light
would
break
up
suddenly
into
a
kind
of
beaten
foam
and
again
after
chasing
one
another
in
regular
order
they
would
seem
to
bend
forward
in
concentric
curves
and
disappear
on
some
hillside
like
on
a
shelving
shore
the
quantity
of
light
reflected
from
the
bent
needles
was
so
great
as
to
make
whole
groves
appear
as
if
covered
with
snow
while
the
black
shadows
beneath
the
trees
greatly
enhanced
the
effect
of
the
silvery
splendor
excepting
only
the
shadows
there
was
nothing
somber
in
all
this
wild
sea
of
pines
on
the
contrary
notwithstanding
this
was
the
winter
season
the
colors
were
remarkably
beautiful
the
shafts
of
the
pine
and
libocedrus
were
brown
and
purple
and
most
of
the
foliage
was
well
tinged
with
yellow
the
laurel
groves
with
the
pale
undersides
of
their
leaves
turned
upward
made
masses
of
gray
and
then
there
was
many
a
dash
of
chocolate
color
from
clumps
of
manzanita
and
jet
of
vivid
crimson
from
the
bark
of
the
madroños
while
the
ground
on
the
hillsides
appearing
here
and
there
through
openings
between
the
groves
displayed
masses
of
pale
purple
and
brown
the
sounds
of
the
storm
corresponded
gloriously
with
this
wild
exuberance
of
light
and
motion
the
profound
bass
of
the
naked
branches
and
boles
booming
like
waterfalls
the
quick
tense
vibrations
of
the
now
rising
to
a
shrill
whistling
hiss
now
falling
to
a
silky
murmur
the
rustling
of
laurel
groves
in
the
dells
and
the
keen
metallic
click
of
leaf
on
this
was
heard
in
easy
analysis
when
the
attention
was
calmly
bent
the
varied
gestures
of
the
multitude
were
seen
to
fine
advantage
so
that
one
could
recognize
the
different
species
at
a
distance
of
several
miles
by
this
means
alone
as
well
as
by
their
forms
and
colors
and
the
way
they
reflected
the
light
all
seemed
strong
and
comfortable
as
if
really
enjoying
the
storm
while
responding
to
its
most
enthusiastic
greetings
we
hear
much
nowadays
concerning
the
universal
struggle
for
existence
but
no
struggle
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
was
manifest
here
no
recognition
of
danger
by
any
tree
no
deprecation
but
rather
an
invincible
gladness
as
remote
from
exultation
as
from
fear
i
kept
my
lofty
perch
for
hours
frequently
closing
my
eyes
to
enjoy
the
music
by
itself
or
to
feast
quietly
on
the
delicious
fragrance
that
was
streaming
past
the
fragrance
of
the
woods
was
less
marked
than
that
produced
during
warm
rain
when
so
many
balsamic
buds
and
leaves
are
steeped
like
tea
but
from
the
chafing
of
resiny
branches
against
each
other
and
the
incessant
attrition
of
myriads
of
needles
the
gale
was
spiced
to
a
very
tonic
degree
and
besides
the
fragrance
from
these
local
sources
there
were
traces
of
scents
brought
from
afar
for
this
wind
came
first
from
the
sea
rubbing
against
its
fresh
briny
waves
then
distilled
through
the
redwoods
threading
rich
ferny
gulches
and
spreading
itself
in
broad
undulating
currents
over
many
a
ridge
of
the
coast
mountains
then
across
the
golden
plains
up
the
purple
and
into
these
piny
woods
with
the
varied
incense
gathered
by
the
way
winds
are
advertisements
of
all
they
touch
however
much
or
little
we
may
be
able
to
read
them
telling
their
wanderings
even
by
their
scents
alone
mariners
detect
the
flowery
perfume
of
far
at
sea
and
carry
the
fragrance
of
dulse
and
tangle
far
inland
where
it
is
quickly
recognized
though
mingled
with
the
scents
of
a
thousand
as
an
illustration
of
this
i
may
tell
here
that
i
breathed
on
the
firth
of
forth
in
scotland
while
a
boy
then
was
taken
to
wisconsin
where
i
remained
nineteen
years
then
without
in
all
this
time
having
breathed
one
breath
of
the
sea
i
walked
quietly
alone
from
the
middle
of
the
mississippi
valley
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
a
botanical
excursion
and
while
in
florida
far
from
the
coast
my
attention
wholly
bent
on
the
splendid
tropical
vegetation
about
me
i
suddenly
recognized
a
as
it
came
sifting
through
the
palmettos
and
blooming
which
at
once
awakened
and
set
free
a
thousand
dormant
associations
and
made
me
a
boy
again
in
scotland
as
if
all
the
intervening
years
had
been
annihilated
most
people
like
to
look
at
mountain
rivers
and
bear
them
in
mind
but
few
care
to
look
at
the
winds
though
far
more
beautiful
and
sublime
and
though
they
become
at
times
about
as
visible
as
flowing
water
when
the
north
winds
in
winter
are
making
upward
sweeps
over
the
curving
summits
of
the
high
sierra
the
fact
is
sometimes
published
with
flying
a
mile
long
those
portions
of
the
winds
thus
embodied
can
scarce
be
wholly
invisible
even
to
the
darkest
imagination
and
when
we
look
around
over
an
agitated
forest
we
may
see
something
of
the
wind
that
stirs
it
by
its
effects
upon
the
trees
yonder
it
descends
in
a
rush
of
ripples
and
sweeps
over
the
bending
pines
from
hill
to
hill
nearer
we
see
detached
plumes
and
leaves
now
speeding
by
on
level
currents
now
whirling
in
eddies
or
escaping
over
the
edges
of
the
whirls
soaring
aloft
on
grand
upswelling
domes
of
air
or
tossing
on
crests
smooth
deep
currents
cascades
falls
and
swirling
eddies
sing
around
every
tree
and
leaf
and
over
all
the
varied
topography
of
the
region
with
telling
changes
of
form
like
mountain
rivers
conforming
to
the
features
of
their
channels
after
tracing
the
sierra
streams
from
their
fountains
to
the
plains
marking
where
they
bloom
white
in
falls
glide
in
crystal
plumes
surge
gray
and
in
gorges
and
slip
through
the
woods
in
long
tranquil
thus
learning
their
language
and
forms
in
detail
we
may
at
length
hear
them
chanting
all
together
in
one
grand
anthem
and
comprehend
them
all
in
clear
inner
vision
covering
the
range
like
lace
but
even
this
spectacle
is
far
less
sublime
and
not
a
whit
more
substantial
than
what
we
may
behold
of
these
of
air
in
the
mountain
woods
we
all
travel
the
milky
way
together
trees
and
men
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
until
this
while
swinging
in
the
wind
that
trees
are
travelers
in
the
ordinary
sense
they
make
many
journeys
not
extensive
ones
it
is
true
but
our
own
little
journeys
away
and
back
again
are
only
little
more
than
of
them
not
so
much
when
the
storm
began
to
abate
i
dismounted
and
sauntered
down
through
the
calming
woods
the
died
away
and
turning
toward
the
east
i
beheld
the
countless
hosts
of
the
forests
hushed
and
tranquil
towering
above
one
another
on
the
slopes
of
the
hills
like
a
devout
audience
the
setting
sun
filled
them
with
amber
light
and
seemed
to
say
while
they
listened
peace
i
give
unto
as
i
gazed
on
the
impressive
scene
all
the
ruin
of
the
storm
was
forgotten
and
never
before
did
these
noble
woods
appear
so
fresh
so
joyous
so
immortal
chapter
xi
the
river
floods
the
sierra
rivers
are
flooded
every
spring
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
as
regularly
as
the
famous
old
nile
they
begin
to
rise
in
may
and
in
june
mark
is
reached
but
because
the
melting
does
not
go
on
rapidly
over
all
the
fountains
high
and
low
simultaneously
and
the
melted
snow
is
not
reinforced
at
this
time
of
year
by
rain
the
spring
floods
are
seldom
very
violent
or
destructive
the
thousand
falls
however
and
the
cascades
in
the
cañons
are
then
in
full
bloom
and
sing
songs
from
one
end
of
the
range
to
the
other
of
course
the
snow
on
the
lower
tributaries
of
the
rivers
is
first
melted
then
that
on
the
higher
fountains
most
exposed
to
sunshine
and
about
a
month
later
the
cooler
shadowy
fountains
send
down
their
treasures
thus
allowing
the
main
trunk
streams
nearly
six
weeks
to
get
their
waters
hurried
through
the
and
across
the
lowlands
to
the
sea
therefore
very
violent
spring
floods
are
avoided
and
will
be
as
long
as
the
shading
restraining
forests
last
the
rivers
of
the
north
half
of
the
range
are
still
less
subject
to
sudden
floods
because
their
upper
fountains
in
great
part
lie
protected
from
the
changes
of
the
weather
beneath
thick
folds
of
lava
just
as
many
of
the
rivers
of
alaska
lie
beneath
folds
of
ice
coming
to
the
light
farther
down
the
range
in
large
springs
while
those
of
the
high
sierra
lie
on
the
surface
of
solid
granite
exposed
to
every
change
of
temperature
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
the
water
derived
from
the
snow
and
ice
of
mount
shasta
is
at
once
absorbed
and
drained
away
beneath
the
porous
lava
folds
of
the
mountain
where
mumbling
and
groping
in
the
dark
they
at
length
find
larger
fissures
and
caves
from
which
they
emerge
filtered
and
cool
in
the
form
of
large
springs
some
of
them
so
large
they
give
birth
to
rivers
that
set
out
on
their
journeys
beneath
the
sun
without
any
visible
intermediate
period
of
childhood
thus
the
shasta
river
issues
from
a
large
spring
in
shasta
valley
and
about
two
thirds
of
the
volume
of
the
mccloud
river
gushes
forth
suddenly
from
the
face
of
a
lava
bluff
in
a
roaring
spring
yards
wide
these
spring
rivers
of
the
north
are
of
course
shorter
than
those
of
the
south
whose
tributaries
extend
up
to
the
tops
of
the
mountains
fall
river
an
important
tributary
of
the
pitt
or
upper
sacramento
is
only
about
ten
miles
long
and
is
all
falls
cascades
and
springs
from
its
head
to
its
confluence
with
the
pitt
bountiful
springs
charmingly
embowered
issue
from
the
rocks
at
one
end
of
it
a
snowy
fall
a
hundred
and
eighty
feet
high
thunders
at
the
other
and
a
rush
of
crystal
rapids
sing
and
dance
between
of
course
such
streams
are
but
little
affected
by
the
weather
sheltered
from
evaporation
their
flow
is
nearly
as
full
in
the
autumn
as
in
the
time
of
general
spring
floods
while
those
of
the
high
sierra
diminish
to
less
than
the
hundredth
part
of
their
springtime
prime
shallowing
in
autumn
to
a
series
of
silent
pools
among
the
rocks
and
hollows
of
their
channels
connected
by
feeble
creeping
threads
of
water
like
the
sluggish
sentences
of
a
tired
writer
connected
by
a
drizzle
of
and
strange
to
say
the
greatest
floods
occur
in
winter
when
one
would
suppose
all
the
wild
waters
would
be
muffled
and
chained
in
frost
and
snow
the
same
long
storms
of
the
rainy
season
in
california
that
give
rain
to
the
lowlands
give
dry
frosty
snow
to
the
mountains
but
at
rare
intervals
warm
rains
and
warm
winds
invade
the
mountains
and
push
back
the
snow
line
from
feet
to
or
even
higher
and
then
come
the
big
floods
i
was
usually
driven
down
out
of
the
high
sierra
about
the
end
of
november
but
the
winter
of
and
was
so
warm
and
calm
that
i
was
tempted
to
seek
general
views
of
the
geology
and
topography
of
the
basin
of
feather
river
in
january
and
i
had
just
completed
a
hasty
survey
of
the
region
and
made
my
way
down
to
winter
quarters
when
one
of
the
grandest
that
i
ever
saw
broke
on
the
mountains
i
was
then
in
the
edge
of
the
main
forest
belt
at
a
small
town
called
knoxville
on
the
divide
between
the
waters
of
the
feather
and
yuba
rivers
the
cause
of
this
notable
flood
was
simply
a
sudden
and
copious
fall
of
warm
wind
and
rain
on
the
basins
of
these
rivers
at
a
time
when
they
contained
a
considerable
quantity
of
snow
the
rain
was
so
heavy
and
that
it
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
make
a
good
wild
flood
while
the
snow
which
the
warm
wind
and
rain
melted
on
the
upper
and
middle
regions
of
the
basins
was
sufficient
to
make
another
flood
equal
to
that
of
the
rain
now
these
two
distinct
harvests
of
flood
waters
were
gathered
simultaneously
and
poured
out
on
the
plain
in
one
magnificent
avalanche
the
basins
of
the
yuba
and
feather
like
many
others
of
the
sierra
are
admirably
adapted
to
the
growth
of
floods
of
this
kind
their
many
tributaries
radiate
far
and
wide
comprehending
extensive
areas
and
the
tributaries
are
steeply
inclined
while
the
trunks
are
comparatively
level
while
the
was
in
progress
the
thermometer
at
knoxville
ranged
between
and
and
when
warm
wind
and
warm
rain
fall
simultaneously
on
snow
contained
in
basins
like
these
both
the
rain
and
that
portion
of
the
snow
which
the
rain
and
wind
melt
are
at
first
sponged
up
and
held
back
until
the
combined
mass
becomes
sludge
which
at
length
suddenly
dissolving
slips
and
descends
all
together
to
the
trunk
channel
and
since
the
deeper
the
stream
the
faster
it
flows
the
flooded
portion
of
the
current
above
overtakes
the
slower
portion
below
it
and
all
sweeping
forward
together
with
a
high
overcurling
front
debouches
on
the
open
plain
with
a
violence
and
suddenness
that
at
first
seem
wholly
unaccountable
the
destructiveness
of
the
lower
portion
of
this
particular
flood
was
somewhat
augmented
by
mining
gravel
in
the
river
channels
and
by
levees
which
gave
way
after
having
at
first
restrained
and
held
back
the
accumulating
waters
these
exaggerating
conditions
did
not
however
greatly
influence
the
general
result
the
main
effect
having
been
caused
by
the
rare
combination
of
flood
factors
indicated
above
it
is
a
pity
that
but
few
people
meet
and
enjoy
storms
so
noble
as
this
in
their
homes
in
the
mountains
for
spending
themselves
in
the
open
levels
of
the
plains
they
are
likely
to
be
remembered
more
by
the
bridges
and
houses
they
carry
away
than
by
their
beauty
or
the
thousand
blessings
they
bring
to
the
fields
and
gardens
of
nature
on
the
morning
of
the
flood
january
all
the
feather
and
yuba
landscapes
were
covered
with
running
water
muddy
torrents
filled
every
gulch
and
ravine
and
the
sky
was
thick
with
rain
the
pines
had
long
been
sleeping
in
sunshine
they
were
now
awake
roaring
and
waving
with
the
beating
storm
and
the
winds
sweeping
along
the
curves
of
hill
and
dale
streaming
through
the
woods
surging
and
gurgling
on
the
tops
of
rocky
ridges
made
the
wildest
of
wild
storm
melody
it
was
easy
to
see
that
only
a
small
part
of
the
rain
reached
the
ground
in
the
form
of
drops
most
of
it
was
thrashed
into
dusty
spray
like
that
into
which
small
waterfalls
are
divided
when
they
dash
on
shelving
rocks
never
have
i
seen
water
coming
from
the
sky
in
denser
or
more
passionate
streams
the
wind
chased
the
spray
forward
in
choking
drifts
and
compelled
me
again
and
again
to
seek
shelter
in
the
dell
copses
and
back
of
large
trees
to
rest
and
catch
my
breath
wherever
i
went
on
ridges
or
in
hollows
enthusiastic
water
still
flashed
and
gurgled
about
my
ankles
recalling
a
wild
winter
flood
in
yosemite
when
a
hundred
waterfalls
came
booming
and
chanting
together
and
filled
the
grand
valley
with
a
roar
after
drifting
an
hour
or
two
in
the
lower
woods
i
set
out
for
the
summit
of
a
hill
feet
high
with
a
view
to
getting
as
near
the
heart
of
the
storm
as
possible
in
order
to
reach
it
i
had
to
cross
dry
creek
a
tributary
of
the
yuba
that
goes
crawling
along
the
base
of
the
hill
on
the
northwest
it
was
now
a
booming
river
as
large
as
the
tuolumne
at
ordinary
stages
its
current
brown
with
washed
down
from
many
a
and
mottled
with
and
logs
that
had
long
lain
above
its
reach
a
slim
stretched
across
it
now
scarcely
above
the
swollen
current
here
i
was
glad
to
linger
gazing
and
listening
while
the
storm
was
in
its
richest
gray
above
the
brown
beneath
the
language
of
the
river
was
scarcely
less
enchanting
than
that
of
the
wind
and
rain
the
sublime
overboom
of
the
main
bouncing
exulting
current
the
swash
and
gurgle
of
the
eddies
the
keen
dash
and
clash
of
heavy
waves
breaking
against
rocks
and
the
smooth
downy
hush
of
shallow
currents
feeling
their
way
through
the
willow
thickets
of
the
margin
and
amid
all
this
varied
throng
of
sounds
i
heard
the
smothered
bumping
and
rumbling
of
boulders
on
the
bottom
as
they
were
shoving
and
rolling
forward
against
one
another
in
a
wild
rush
after
having
lain
still
for
probably
years
or
more
the
glad
creek
rose
high
above
its
banks
and
wandered
from
its
channel
out
over
many
a
briery
and
meadow
alders
and
willows
were
bearing
up
against
the
current
with
nervous
trembling
gestures
as
if
afraid
of
being
carried
away
while
supple
branches
bending
confidingly
dipped
lightly
and
rose
again
as
if
stroking
the
wild
waters
in
play
leaving
the
bridge
and
passing
on
through
the
woods
all
the
ground
seemed
to
be
moving
flakes
of
bark
soil
leaves
and
broken
branches
were
being
swept
forward
and
many
a
weathered
from
exposed
ledges
was
now
receiving
its
first
rounding
and
polishing
in
the
wild
streams
of
the
storm
on
they
rushed
through
every
gulch
and
hollow
leaping
gliding
working
with
a
will
and
rejoicing
like
living
creatures
nor
was
the
flood
confined
to
the
ground
every
tree
had
a
water
system
of
its
own
spreading
far
and
wide
like
miniature
amazons
and
mississippis
toward
midday
cloud
wind
and
rain
reached
their
highest
development
the
storm
was
in
full
bloom
and
formed
from
my
commanding
outlook
on
the
hilltop
one
of
the
most
glorious
views
i
ever
beheld
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
above
beneath
around
rain
filled
the
air
like
one
vast
waterfall
detached
clouds
swept
imposingly
up
the
valley
as
if
they
were
endowed
with
independent
motion
and
had
special
work
to
do
in
replenishing
the
mountain
wells
now
rising
above
the
now
descending
into
their
midst
fondling
their
arrowy
spires
and
soothing
every
branch
and
leaf
with
gentleness
in
the
midst
of
all
the
savage
sound
and
motion
others
keeping
near
the
ground
glided
behind
separate
groves
and
brought
them
forward
into
relief
with
admirable
distinctness
or
passing
in
front
eclipsed
whole
groves
in
succession
pine
after
pine
melting
in
their
gray
fringes
and
bursting
forth
again
seemingly
clearer
than
before
the
forms
of
storms
are
in
great
part
measured
and
controlled
by
the
topography
of
the
regions
where
they
rise
and
over
which
they
pass
when
therefore
we
attempt
to
study
them
from
the
valleys
or
from
gaps
and
openings
of
the
forest
we
are
confounded
by
a
multitude
of
separate
and
apparently
antagonistic
impressions
the
bottom
of
the
storm
is
broken
up
into
innumerable
waves
and
currents
that
surge
against
the
hillsides
like
against
a
shore
and
these
reacting
on
the
nether
surface
of
the
storm
erode
immense
cavernous
hollows
and
cañons
and
sweep
forward
the
resulting
detritus
in
long
trains
like
the
moraines
of
glaciers
but
as
we
ascend
these
partial
confusing
effects
disappear
and
the
phenomena
are
beheld
united
and
harmonious
the
longer
i
gazed
into
the
storm
the
more
plainly
visible
it
became
the
drifting
cloud
detritus
gave
it
a
kind
of
visible
body
which
explained
many
perplexing
phenomena
and
published
its
movements
in
plain
terms
while
the
texture
of
the
falling
mass
of
rain
rounded
it
out
and
rendered
it
more
complete
because
raindrops
differ
in
size
they
fall
at
different
velocities
and
overtake
and
clash
against
one
another
producing
mist
and
spray
they
also
of
course
yield
unequal
compliance
to
the
force
of
the
wind
which
gives
rise
to
a
still
greater
degree
of
interference
and
passionate
gusts
sweep
off
clouds
of
spray
from
the
groves
like
that
torn
from
in
a
gale
all
these
factors
of
irregularity
in
density
color
and
texture
of
the
general
rain
mass
tend
to
make
it
the
more
appreciable
and
telling
it
is
then
seen
as
one
grand
flood
rushing
over
bank
and
brae
bending
the
pines
like
weeds
curving
this
way
and
that
whirling
in
huge
eddies
in
hollows
and
dells
while
the
main
current
pours
grandly
over
all
like
ocean
currents
over
the
landscapes
that
lie
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
watched
the
gestures
of
the
pines
while
the
storm
was
at
its
height
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
not
distressed
several
large
sugar
pines
stood
near
the
thicket
in
which
i
was
sheltered
bowing
solemnly
and
tossing
their
long
arms
as
if
interpreting
the
very
words
of
the
storm
while
accepting
its
wildest
onsets
with
passionate
exhilaration
the
lions
were
feeding
those
who
have
observed
sunflowers
feasting
on
sunshine
during
the
golden
days
of
indian
summer
know
that
none
of
their
gestures
express
thankfulness
their
celestial
food
is
too
heartily
given
too
heartily
taken
to
leave
room
for
thanks
the
pines
were
evidently
accepting
the
benefactions
of
the
storm
in
the
same
manner
and
when
i
looked
down
among
the
budding
hazels
and
still
lower
to
the
young
violets
and
on
the
rocks
i
noticed
the
same
divine
methods
of
giving
and
taking
and
the
same
exquisite
adaptations
of
what
seems
an
outbreak
of
violent
and
uncontrollable
force
to
the
purposes
of
beautiful
and
delicate
life
calms
like
sleep
come
upon
landscapes
just
as
they
do
on
people
and
trees
and
storms
awaken
them
in
the
same
way
in
the
dry
midsummer
of
the
lower
portion
of
the
range
the
withered
hills
and
valleys
seem
to
lie
as
empty
and
expressionless
as
dead
shells
on
a
shore
even
the
highest
mountains
may
be
found
occasionally
dull
and
uncommunicative
as
if
in
some
way
they
had
lost
countenance
and
shrunk
to
less
than
half
their
real
stature
but
when
the
lightnings
crash
and
echo
in
the
cañons
and
the
clouds
come
down
wreathing
and
crowning
their
bald
snowy
heads
every
feature
beams
with
expression
and
they
rise
again
in
all
their
imposing
majesty
storms
are
fine
speakers
and
tell
all
they
know
but
their
voices
of
lightning
torrent
and
rushing
wind
are
much
less
numerous
than
the
nameless
still
small
voices
too
low
for
human
ears
and
because
we
are
poor
listeners
we
fail
to
catch
much
that
is
fairly
within
reach
our
best
rains
are
heard
mostly
on
roofs
and
winds
in
chimneys
and
when
by
choice
or
compulsion
we
are
pushed
into
the
heart
of
a
storm
the
confusion
made
by
cumbersome
equipments
and
nervous
haste
and
mean
fear
prevent
our
hearing
any
other
than
the
loudest
expressions
yet
we
may
draw
enjoyment
from
storm
sounds
that
are
beyond
hearing
and
storm
movements
we
can
not
see
the
sublime
whirl
of
planets
around
their
suns
is
as
silent
as
raindrops
oozing
in
the
dark
among
the
roots
of
plants
in
this
great
storm
as
in
every
other
there
were
tones
and
gestures
inexpressibly
gentle
manifested
in
the
midst
of
what
is
called
violence
and
fury
but
easily
recognized
by
all
who
look
and
listen
for
them
the
rain
brought
out
the
colors
of
the
woods
with
delightful
freshness
the
rich
brown
of
the
bark
of
the
trees
and
the
fallen
burs
and
leaves
and
dead
ferns
the
grays
of
rocks
and
lichens
the
light
purple
of
swelling
buds
and
the
warm
yellow
greens
of
the
libocedrus
and
mosses
the
air
was
steaming
with
delightful
fragrance
not
rising
and
wafting
past
in
separate
masses
but
diffused
through
all
the
atmosphere
pine
woods
are
always
fragrant
but
most
so
in
spring
when
the
young
tassels
are
opening
and
in
warm
weather
when
the
various
gums
and
balsams
are
softened
by
the
sun
the
wind
was
now
chafing
their
innumerable
needles
and
the
warm
rain
was
steeping
them
monardella
grows
here
in
large
beds
in
the
openings
and
there
is
plenty
of
laurel
in
dells
and
manzanita
on
the
hillsides
and
the
rosy
fragrant
chamoebatia
carpets
the
ground
almost
everywhere
these
with
the
gums
and
balsams
of
the
woods
form
the
main
local
of
the
storm
the
ascending
clouds
of
aroma
and
became
pure
like
light
and
traveled
with
the
wind
as
part
of
it
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
main
flood
cloud
lifted
along
its
western
border
revealing
a
beautiful
section
of
the
sacramento
valley
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
away
brilliantly
and
glistering
with
as
if
paved
with
silver
soon
afterward
a
jagged
cloud
with
a
sheer
face
appeared
over
the
valley
of
the
yuba
and
roughened
with
numerous
furrows
like
some
huge
the
blue
coast
range
was
seen
stretching
along
the
sky
like
a
beveled
wall
and
the
somber
craggy
marysville
buttes
rose
impressively
out
of
the
flooded
plain
like
islands
out
of
the
sea
then
the
rain
began
to
abate
and
i
sauntered
down
through
the
dripping
bushes
reveling
in
the
universal
vigor
and
freshness
that
inspired
all
the
life
about
me
how
clean
and
unworn
and
immortal
the
woods
seemed
to
be
lofty
cedars
in
full
bloom
laden
with
golden
pollen
and
their
washed
plumes
shining
the
pines
rocking
gently
and
settling
back
into
rest
and
the
evening
sunbeams
spangling
on
the
broad
leaves
of
the
madroños
their
tracery
of
yellow
boughs
relieved
against
dusky
thickets
of
chestnut
oak
liverworts
lycopodiums
ferns
were
exulting
in
glorious
revival
and
every
moss
that
had
ever
lived
seemed
to
be
coming
crowding
back
from
the
dead
to
clothe
each
trunk
and
stone
in
living
green
the
steaming
ground
seemed
fairly
to
throb
and
tingle
with
life
smilax
fritillaria
saxifrage
and
young
violets
were
pushing
up
as
if
already
conscious
of
the
summer
glory
and
innumerable
green
and
yellow
buds
were
peeping
and
smiling
everywhere
as
for
the
birds
and
squirrels
not
a
wing
or
tail
of
them
was
to
be
seen
while
the
storm
was
blowing
squirrels
dislike
wet
weather
more
than
cats
do
therefore
they
were
at
home
rocking
in
their
dry
nests
the
birds
were
hiding
in
the
dells
out
of
the
wind
some
of
the
strongest
of
them
pecking
at
acorns
and
manzanita
berries
but
most
were
perched
on
low
twigs
their
breast
feathers
puffed
out
and
keeping
one
another
company
through
the
hard
time
as
best
they
could
when
i
arrived
at
the
village
about
sundown
the
good
people
bestirred
themselves
pitying
my
bedraggled
condition
as
if
i
were
some
benumbed
castaway
snatched
from
the
sea
while
i
in
turn
warm
with
excitement
and
reeking
like
the
ground
pitied
them
for
being
dry
and
defrauded
of
all
the
glory
that
nature
had
spread
round
about
them
that
day
chapter
xii
sierra
the
weather
of
spring
and
summer
in
the
middle
region
of
the
sierra
is
usually
well
flecked
with
rains
and
light
dustings
of
snow
most
of
which
are
far
too
obviously
joyful
and
to
be
regarded
as
storms
and
in
the
picturesque
beauty
and
clearness
of
outlines
of
their
clouds
they
offer
striking
contrasts
to
those
boundless
of
the
storms
of
winter
the
smallest
and
most
perfectly
individualized
specimens
present
a
richly
modeled
cumulous
cloud
rising
above
the
dark
woods
about
swelling
with
a
visible
motion
straight
up
into
the
calm
sunny
sky
to
a
height
of
to
feet
above
the
sea
its
white
pearly
bosses
relieved
by
gray
and
pale
purple
shadows
in
the
hollows
and
showing
outlines
as
keenly
defined
as
those
of
the
domes
in
less
than
an
hour
it
attains
full
development
and
stands
poised
in
the
blazing
sunshine
like
some
colossal
mountain
as
beautiful
in
form
and
finish
as
if
it
were
to
become
a
permanent
addition
to
the
landscape
presently
a
thunderbolt
crashes
through
the
crisp
air
ringing
like
steel
on
steel
sharp
and
clear
its
startling
detonation
breaking
into
a
spray
of
echoes
against
the
cliffs
and
cañon
walls
then
down
comes
a
cataract
of
rain
the
big
drops
sift
through
the
plash
and
patter
on
the
granite
pavements
and
pour
down
the
sides
of
ridges
and
domes
in
a
network
of
gray
bubbling
rills
in
a
few
minutes
the
cloud
withers
to
a
mesh
of
dim
filaments
and
disappears
leaving
the
sky
perfectly
clear
and
bright
every
wiped
and
washed
out
of
it
everything
is
refreshed
and
invigorated
a
steam
of
fragrance
rises
and
the
storm
is
cloud
one
and
one
dash
of
rain
this
is
the
sierra
reduced
to
its
lowest
terms
but
some
of
them
attain
much
larger
proportions
and
assume
a
grandeur
and
energy
of
expression
hardly
surpassed
by
those
bred
in
the
depths
of
winter
producing
those
sudden
floods
called
which
are
local
and
to
a
considerable
extent
periodical
for
they
appear
nearly
every
day
about
the
same
time
for
weeks
usually
about
eleven
and
lasting
from
five
minutes
to
an
hour
or
two
one
soon
becomes
so
accustomed
to
see
them
that
the
noon

the

beautiful
and
imposing
of

rise
just
above

and
all
are
so
beautiful
that
it
is
not
easy
to
choose
any
one
for

description
the
one
that
i
remember
best
fell
on
the
mountains
near
yosemite
valley
july
while
i
was
encamped
in
the
silver
fir
woods
a
range
of
bossy
cumuli
took
possession
of
the
sky
huge
domes
and
peaks
rising
one
beyond
another
with
deep
cañons
between
them
bending
this
way
and
that
in
long
curves
and
reaches
interrupted
here
and
there
with
white
upboiling
masses
that
looked
like
the
spray
of
waterfalls
zigzag
lances
of
lightning
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
and
the
thunder
was
so
gloriously
loud
and
massive
it
seemed
as
if
surely
an
entire
mountain
was
being
shattered
at
every
stroke
only
the
trees
were
touched
however
so
far
as
i
could
see
few
firs
feet
high
perhaps
and
five
to
six
feet
in
diameter
were
split
into
long
rails
and
slivers
from
top
to
bottom
and
scattered
to
all
points
of
the
compass
then
came
the
rain
in
a
hearty
flood
covering
the
ground
and
making
it
shine
with
a
continuous
sheet
of
water
that
like
a
transparent

or
skin
fitted
closely
down
over
all
the
rugged
anatomy
of
the
landscape
it
is
not
long
geologically

since
the
first
raindrop
fell
on
the

of
the

in
the
few
tens
of
thousands
of
years
of
stormy
cultivation
they
have
been
blest
with
how
beautiful
they
have

fell
on
raw
crumbling
moraines

without

chapter

the
the
waterfalls
of
the
sierra
are
frequented
by
only
one
bird
ouzel
or
water
thrush
he
is
a
singularly
joyous
and
lovable
little
fellow
about
the
size
of
a
robin
clad
in
a
plain
waterproof
suit
of
bluish
gray
with
a
tinge
of
chocolate
on
the
head
and
shoulders
in
form
he
is
about
as
smoothly
plump
and
compact
as
a
pebble
that
has
been
whirled
in
a
the
flowing
contour
of
his
body
being
interrupted
only
by
his
strong
feet
and
bill
the
crisp
and
the
tail
among
all
the
countless
waterfalls
i
have
met
in
the
course
of
ten
exploration
in
the
sierra
whether
among
the
icy
peaks
or
warm
or
in
the
profound
yosemitic
cañons
of
the
middle
region
not
one
was
found
without
its
ouzel
no
cañon
is
too
cold
for
this
little
bird
none
too
lonely
provided
it
be
rich
in
falling
water
find
a
fall
or
cascade
or
rushing
rapid
anywhere
upon
a
clear
stream
and
there
you
will
surely
find
its
complementary
ouzel
flitting
about
in
the
spray
diving
in
foaming
eddies
whirling
like
a
leaf
among
beaten
ever
vigorous
and
enthusiastic
yet
and
neither
seeking
nor
shunning
your
company
illustration
diving
and
feeding
if
disturbed
while
dipping
about
in
the
margin
shallows
he
either
sets
off
with
a
rapid
whir
to
some
other
up
or
down
the
stream
or
alights
on
some
rock
or
snag
out
in
the
current
and
immediately
begins
to
nod
and
courtesy
like
a
wren
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
many
other
odd
dainty
movements
that
never
fail
to
fix
the
attention
of
the
observer
he
is
the
mountain
own
darling
the
of
blooming
waters
loving
rocky
and
sheets
of
foam
as
a
bee
loves
flowers
as
a
lark
loves
sunshine
and
meadows
among
all
the
mountain
birds
none
has
cheered
me
so
much
in
my
lonely
wanderings
so
unfailingly
for
both
in
winter
and
summer
he
sings
sweetly
cheerily
independent
alike
of
sunshine
and
of
love
requiring
no
other
inspiration
than
the
stream
on
which
he
dwells
while
water
sings
so
must
he
in
heat
or
cold
calm
or
storm
ever
attuning
his
voice
in
sure
accord
low
in
the
drought
of
summer
and
the
drought
of
winter
but
never
silent
during
the
golden
days
of
indian
summer
after
most
of
the
snow
has
been
melted
and
the
mountain
streams
have
become
feeble
succession
of
silent
pools
linked
together
by
shallow
transparent
currents
and
strips
of
silvery
lacework
the
song
of
the
ouzel
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
but
as
soon
as
the
winter
clouds
have
bloomed
and
the
mountain
treasuries
are
once
more
replenished
with
snow
the
voices
of
the
streams
and
ouzels
increase
in
strength
and
richness
until
the
flood
season
of
early
summer
then
the
torrents
chant
their
noblest
anthems
and
then
is
the
of
our
melody
as
for
weather
dark
days
and
sun
days
are
the
same
to
him
the
voices
of
most
however
joyous
suffer
a
long
winter
eclipse
but
the
ouzel
sings
on
through
all
the
seasons
and
every
kind
of
storm
indeed
no
storm
can
be
more
violent
than
those
of
the
waterfalls
in
the
midst
of
which
he
delights
to
dwell
however
dark
and
boisterous
the
weather
snowing
blowing
or
cloudy
all
the
same
he
sings
and
with
never
a
note
of
sadness
no
need
of
spring
sunshine
to
thaw
song
for
it
never
freezes
never
shall
you
hear
anything
wintry
from
warm
breast
no
pinched
cheeping
no
wavering
notes
between
sorrow
and
joy
his
mellow
fluty
voice
is
ever
tuned
to
downright
gladness
as
free
from
dejection
as
it
is
pitiful
to
see
wee
sparrows
on
cold
mornings
in
the
mountain
groves
shaking
the
snow
from
their
feathers
and
hopping
about
as
if
anxious
to
be
cheery
then
hastening
back
to
their
hidings
out
of
the
wind
puffing
out
their
over
their
toes
and
subsiding
among
the
leaves
cold
and
breakfastless
while
the
snow
continues
to
fall
and
there
is
no
sign
of
clearing
but
the
ouzel
never
calls
forth
a
single
touch
of
pity
not
because
he
is
strong
to
endure
but
rather
because
he
seems
to
live
a
charmed
life
beyond
the
reach
of
every
influence
that
makes
endurance
necessary
one
wild
winter
morning
when
yosemite
valley
was
swept
its
length
from
west
to
east
by
a
cordial
i
sallied
forth
to
see
what
i
might
learn
and
enjoy
a
sort
of
gray
darkness
filled
the
valley
the
huge
walls
were
out
of
sight
all
ordinary
sounds
were
smothered
and
even
the
loudest
booming
of
the
falls
was
at
times
buried
beneath
the
roar
of
the
blast
the
loose
snow
was
already
over
five
feet
deep
on
the
meadows
making
extended
walks
impossible
without
the
aid
of
i
found
no
great
difficulty
however
in
making
my
way
to
a
certain
ripple
on
the
river
where
one
of
my
ouzels
lived
he
was
at
home
busily
gleaning
his
breakfast
among
the
pebbles
of
a
shallow
portion
of
the
margin
apparently
unaware
of
anything
extraordinary
in
the
weather
presently
he
flew
out
to
a
stone
against
which
the
icy
current
was
beating
and
turning
his
back
to
the
wind
sang
as
delightfully
as
a
lark
in
springtime
after
spending
an
hour
or
two
with
my
favorite
i
made
my
way
across
the
valley
boring
and
wallowing
through
the
drifts
to
learn
as
definitely
as
possible
how
the
other
birds
were
spending
their
time
the
yosemite
birds
are
easily
found
during
the
winter
because
all
of
them
excepting
the
ouzel
are
restricted
to
the
sunny
north
side
of
the
valley
the
south
side
being
constantly
eclipsed
by
the
great
frosty
shadow
of
the
wall
and
because
the
indian
cañon
groves
from
their
peculiar
exposure
are
the
warmest
the
birds
congregate
there
more
especially
in
severe
weather
i
found
most
of
the
robins
cowering
on
the
lee
side
of
the
larger
branches
where
the
snow
could
not
fall
upon
them
while
two
or
three
of
the
more
enterprising
were
making
desperate
efforts
to
reach
the
mistletoe
berries
by
clinging
nervously
to
the
under
side
of
the
masses
back
downward
like
woodpeckers
every
now
and
then
they
would
dislodge
some
of
the
loose
fringes
of
the
which
would
come
sifting
down
on
them
and
send
them
screaming
back
to
camp
where
they
would
subside
among
their
companions
with
a
shiver
muttering
in
low
querulous
chatter
like
hungry
children
some
of
the
sparrows
were
busy
at
the
feet
of
the
larger
trees
gleaning
seeds
and
benumbed
insects
joined
now
and
then
by
a
robin
weary
of
his
unsuccessful
attempts
upon
the
berries
the
brave
woodpeckers
were
clinging
to
the
snowless
sides
of
the
larger
boles
and
overarching
branches
of
the
camp
trees
making
short
nights
from
side
to
side
of
the
grove
pecking
now
and
then
at
the
acorns
they
had
stored
in
the
bark
and
chattering
aimlessly
as
if
unable
to
keep
still
yet
evidently
putting
in
the
time
in
a
very
dull
way
like
travelers
at
a
country
tavern
the
hardy
were
threading
the
open
furrows
of
the
trunks
in
their
usual
industrious
manner
and
uttering
their
quaint
notes
evidently
less
distressed
than
their
neighbors
the
steller
jays
were
of
course
making
more
noisy
stir
than
all
the
other
birds
combined
ever
coming
and
going
with
loud
bluster
screaming
as
if
each
had
a
lump
of
melting
sludge
in
his
throat
and
taking
good
care
to
improve
the
favorable
opportunity
afforded
by
the
storm
to
steal
from
the
acorn
stores
of
the
woodpeckers
i
also
noticed
one
solitary
gray
eagle
braving
the
storm
on
the
top
of
a
tall
just
outside
the
main
grove
he
was
standing
bolt
upright
with
his
back
to
the
wind
a
tuft
of
snow
piled
on
his
square
shoulders
a
monument
of
passive
endurance
thus
every
bird
seemed
more
or
less
uncomfortable
if
not
in
positive
distress
the
storm
was
reflected
in
every
gesture
and
not
one
cheerful
note
not
to
say
song
came
from
a
single
bill
their
cowering
joyless
endurance
offering
a
striking
contrast
to
the
spontaneous
irrepressible
gladness
of
the
ouzel
who
could
no
more
help
exhaling
sweet
song
than
a
rose
sweet
fragrance
he
sing
though
the
heavens
fall
i
remember
noticing
the
distress
of
a
pair
of
robins
during
the
violent
earthquake
of
the
year
when
the
pines
of
the
valley
with
strange
movements
flapped
and
waved
their
branches
and
beetling
came
thundering
down
to
the
meadows
in
tremendous
avalanches
it
did
not
occur
to
me
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
of
other
observations
to
look
for
the
ouzels
but
i
doubt
not
they
were
singing
straight
on
through
it
all
regarding
the
terrible
as
fearlessly
as
they
do
the
booming
of
the
waterfalls
what
may
be
regarded
as
the
separate
songs
of
the
ouzel
are
exceedingly
difficult
of
description
because
they
are
so
variable
and
at
the
same
time
so
confluent
though
i
have
been
acquainted
with
my
favorite
ten
years
and
during
most
of
this
time
have
heard
him
sing
nearly
every
day
i
still
detect
notes
and
strains
that
seem
new
to
me
nearly
all
of
his
music
is
sweet
and
tender
lapsing
from
his
round
breast
like
water
over
the
smooth
lip
of
a
pool
then
breaking
farther
on
into
a
sparkling
foam
of
melodious
notes
which
glow
with
subdued
enthusiasm
yet
without
expressing
much
of
the
strong
gushing
ecstasy
of
the
bobolink
or
skylark
the
more
striking
strains
are
perfect
arabesques
of
melody
composed
of
a
few
full
round
mellow
notes
embroidered
with
delicate
trills
which
fade
and
melt
in
long
slender
cadences
in
a
general
way
his
music
is
that
of
the
streams
refined
and
spiritualized
the
deep
booming
notes
of
the
falls
are
in
it
the
trills
of
rapids
the
gurgling
of
margin
eddies
the
low
whispering
of
level
reaches
and
the
sweet
tinkle
of
separate
drops
oozing
from
the
ends
of
mosses
and
falling
into
tranquil
pools
the
ouzel
never
sings
in
chorus
with
other
birds
nor
with
his
kind
but
only
with
the
streams
and
like
flowers
that
bloom
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ground
some
of
our
best
never
rise
above
the
surface
of
the
heavier
music
of
the
water
i
have
often
observed
him
singing
in
the
midst
of
beaten
spray
his
music
completely
buried
beneath
the
roar
yet
i
knew
he
was
surely
singing
by
his
gestures
and
the
movements
of
his
bill
his
food
as
far
as
i
have
noticed
consists
of
all
kinds
of
water
insects
which
in
summer
are
chiefly
procured
along
shallow
margins
here
he
wades
about
ducking
his
head
under
water
and
deftly
turning
over
pebbles
and
fallen
leaves
with
his
bill
seldom
choosing
to
go
into
deep
water
where
he
has
to
use
his
wings
in
diving
he
seems
to
be
especially
fond
of
the
larvae
of
mosquitos
found
in
abundance
attached
to
the
bottom
of
smooth
rock
channels
where
the
current
is
shallow
when
feeding
in
such
places
he
wades
and
often
while
his
head
is
under
water
the
swift
current
is
deflected
upward
along
the
glossy
curves
of
his
neck
and
shoulders
in
the
form
of
a
clear
crystalline
shell
which
fairly
incloses
him
like
a
the
shell
being
broken
and
as
he
lifts
and
dips
his
head
while
ever
and
anon
he
sidles
out
to
where
the
too
powerful
current
carries
him
off
his
feet
then
he
dexterously
rises
on
the
wing
and
goes
gleaning
again
in
shallower
places
but
during
the
winter
when
the
are
embossed
in
snow
and
the
streams
themselves
are
chilled
nearly
to
the
so
that
the
snow
falling
into
them
in
stormy
weather
is
not
wholly
dissolved
but
forms
a
thin
blue
sludge
thus
rendering
the
current
he
seeks
the
deeper
portions
of
the
main
rivers
where
he
may
dive
to
clear
water
beneath
the
sludge
or
he
repairs
to
some
open
lake
or
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
feeds
in
safety
when
thus
compelled
to
betake
himself
to
a
lake
he
does
not
plunge
into
it
at
once
like
a
duck
but
always
alights
in
the
first
place
upon
some
rock
or
fallen
pine
along
the
shore
then
flying
out
thirty
or
forty
yards
more
or
less
according
to
the
character
of
the
bottom
he
alights
with
a
dainty
glint
on
the
surface
swims
about
looks
down
finally
makes
up
his
mind
and
disappears
with
a
sharp
stroke
of
his
wings
after
feeding
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
suddenly
reappears
showers
the
water
from
his
wings
with
one
vigorous
shake
and
rises
abruptly
into
the
air
as
if
pushed
up
from
beneath
comes
back
to
his
perch
sings
a
few
minutes
and
goes
out
to
dive
again
thus
coming
and
going
singing
and
diving
at
the
same
place
for
hours

one
of
the
of
the
ouzel
the
ouzel
is
usually
found
singly
rarely
in
pairs
excepting
during
the
breeding
season
and
rarely
in
threes
or
fours
i
once
observed
three
thus
spending
a
winter
morning
in
company
upon
a
small
glacier
lake
on
the
upper
merced
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
a
storm
had
occurred
during
the
night
but
the
morning
sun
shone
unclouded
and
the
shadowy
lake
gleaming
darkly
in
its
setting
of
fresh
snow
lay
smooth
and
motionless
as
a
mirror
my
camp
chanced
to
be
within
a
few
feet
of
the
edge
opposite
a
fallen
pine
some
of
the
branches
of
which
leaned
out
over
the
lake
here
my
three
dearly
welcome
visitors
took
up
their
station
and
at
once
began
to
embroider
the
frosty
air
with
their
delicious
melody
doubly
delightful
to
me
that
particular
morning
as
i
had
been
somewhat
apprehensive
of
danger
in
breaking
my
way
down
through
the
cañons
to
the
lowlands
the
portion
of
the
lake
bottom
selected
for
a
lies
at
a
depth
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
and
is
covered
with
a
short
growth
of
algae
and
other
aquatic
plants
i
had
previously
determined
while
sailing
over
it
on
a
raft
after
alighting
on
the
glassy
surface
they
occasionally
indulged
in
a
little
play
chasing
one
another
round
about
in
small
circles
then
all
three
would
suddenly
dive
together
and
then
come
ashore
and
sing
the
ouzel
seldom
swims
more
than
a
few
yards
on
the
surface
for
not
being
he
makes
rather
slow
progress
but
by
means
of
his
strong
crisp
wings
he
swims
or
rather
flies
with
celerity
under
the
surface
often
to
considerable
distances
but
it
is
in
withstanding
the
force
of
heavy
rapids
that
his
strength
of
wing
in
this
respect
is
most
strikingly
manifested
the
following
may
be
regarded
as
a
fair
illustration
of
his
power
of
flight
one
stormy
morning
in
winter
when
the
merced
river
was
blue
and
green
with
unmelted
snow
i
observed
one
of
my
ouzels
perched
on
a
snag
out
in
the
midst
of
a
rapid
singing
cheerily
as
if
everything
was
just
to
his
mind
and
while
i
stood
on
the
bank
admiring
him
he
suddenly
plunged
into
the
sludgy
current
leaving
his
song
abruptly
broken
off
after
feeding
a
minute
or
two
at
the
bottom
and
when
one
would
suppose
that
he
must
inevitably
be
swept
far
he
emerged
just
where
he
went
down
alighted
on
the
same
snag
showered
the
from
his
feathers
and
continued
his
unfinished
song
seemingly
in
tranquil
ease
as
if
it
had
suffered
no
interruption
illustration
ouzel
entering
a
white
current
the
ouzel
alone
of
all
birds
dares
to
enter
a
white
torrent
and
though
strictly
terrestrial
in
structure
no
other
is
so
inseparably
related
to
water
not
even
the
duck
or
the
bold
ocean
albatross
or
the
for
ducks
go
ashore
as
soon
as
they
finish
feeding
in
undisturbed
places
and
very
often
make
long
flights
over
land
from
lake
to
lake
or
field
to
field
the
same
is
true
of
most
other
aquatic
birds
but
the
ouzel
born
on
the
brink
of
a
stream
or
on
a
snag
or
boulder
in
the
midst
of
it
seldom
leaves
it
for
a
single
moment
for
notwithstanding
he
is
often
on
the
wing
he
never
flies
overland
but
whirs
with
rapid
beat
above
the
stream
tracing
all
its
windings
even
when
the
stream
is
quite
small
say
from
five
to
ten
feet
wide
he
seldom
shortens
his
flight
by
crossing
a
bend
however
abrupt
it
may
be
and
even
when
disturbed
by
meeting
some
one
on
the
bank
he
prefers
to
fly
over
head
to
dodging
out
over
the
ground
when
therefore
his
flight
along
a
crooked
stream
is
viewed
endwise
it
appears
most
strikingly
description
on
the
air
of
every
curve
with
rapidity
the
vertical
curves
and
angles
of
the
most
precipitous
torrents
he
traces
with
the
same
rigid
fidelity
swooping
down
the
inclines
of
cascades
dropping
sheer
over
dizzy
falls
amid
the
spray
and
ascending
with
the
same
fearlessness
and
ease
seldom
seeking
to
lessen
the
steepness
of
the
acclivity
by
beginning
to
ascend
before
reaching
the
base
of
the
fall
no
matter
though
it
may
be
several
hundred
feet
in
height
he
holds
straight
on
as
if
about
to
dash
headlong
into
the
throng
of
booming
rockets
then
darts
abruptly
upward
and
after
alighting
at
the
top
of
the
precipice
to
rest
a
moment
proceeds
to
feed
and
sing
his
flight
is
solid
and
impetuous
without
any
intermission
of
homogeneous
buzz
like
that
of
a
laden
bee
on
its
way
home
and
while
thus
buzzing
freely
from
fall
to
fall
he
is
frequently
heard
giving
utterance
to
a
long
outdrawn
train
of
unmodulated
notes
in
no
way
connected
with
his
song
but
corresponding
closely
with
his
flight
in
sustained
vigor
were
the
flights
of
all
the
ouzels
in
the
sierra
traced
on
a
chart
they
would
indicate
the
direction
of
the
flow
of
the
entire
system
of
ancient
glaciers
from
about
the
period
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
until
near
the
close
of
the
glacial
winter
because
the
streams
which
the
ouzels
so
rigidly
follow
are
with
the
unimportant
exceptions
of
a
few
side
tributaries
all
flowing
in
channels
eroded
for
them
out
of
the
solid
flank
of
the
range
by
the
vanished
glaciers
streams
tracing
the
ancient
glaciers
the
ouzels

nor
do
we
find
so
complete
compliance
to
glacial
conditions
in
the
life
of
any
other
mountain
bird
or
animal
of
any
kind
bears
frequently
accept
the
pathways
laid
down
by
glaciers
as
the
easiest
to
travel
but
they
often
leave
them
and
cross
over
from
cañon
to
cañon
so
also
most
of
the
birds
trace
the
moraines
to
some
extent
because
the
forests
are
growing
on
them
but
they
wander
far
crossing
the
cañons
from
grove
to
grove
and
draw
exceedingly
angular
and
complicated
courses
the
nest
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
pieces
of
bird
architecture
i
ever
saw
odd
and
novel
in
design
perfectly
fresh
and
beautiful
and
in
every
way
worthy
of
the
genius
of
the
little
builder
it
is
about
a
foot
in
diameter
round
and
bossy
in
outline
with
a
neatly
arched
opening
near
the
bottom
somewhat
like
an
brick
oven
or
hut
it
is
built
almost
exclusively
of
green
and
yellow
mosses
chiefly
the
beautiful
fronded
hypnum
that
covers
the
rocks
and
old
in
the
vicinity
of
waterfalls
these
are
deftly
interwoven
and
felted
together
into
a
charming
little
hut
and
so
situated
that
many
of
the
outer
mosses
continue
to
flourish
as
if
they
had
not
been
plucked
a
few
fine
grasses
are
occasionally
found
interwoven
with
the
mosses
but
with
the
exception
of
a
thin
layer
lining
the
floor
their
presence
seems
accidental
as
they
are
of
a
species
found
growing
with
the
mosses
and
are
probably
plucked
with
them
the
site
chosen
for
this
curious
mansion
is
usually
some
little
within
reach
of
the
lighter
particles
of
the
spray
of
a
waterfall
so
that
its
walls
are
kept
green
and
growing
at
least
during
the
time
of
high
water
no
harsh
lines
are
presented
by
any
portion
of
the
nest
as
seen
in
place
but
when
removed
from
its
shelf
the
back
and
bottom
and
sometimes
a
portion
of
the
top
is
found
quite
sharply
angular
because
it
is
made
to
conform
to
the
surface
of
the
rock
upon
which
and
against
which
it
is
built
the
little
architect
always
taking
advantage
of
slight
crevices
and
protuberances
that
may
chance
to
offer
to
render
his
structure
stable
by
means
of
a
kind
of
gripping
and
dovetailing
in
choosing
a
concealment
does
not
seem
to
be
taken
into
consideration
yet
notwithstanding
the
nest
is
large
and
guilelessly
exposed
to
view
it
is
far
from
being
easily
detected
chiefly
because
it
swells
forward
like
any
other
bulging
growing
naturally
in
such
situations
this
is
more
especially
the
case
where
the
nest
is
kept
fresh
by
being
well
sprinkled
sometimes
these
romantic
little
huts
have
their
beauty
enhanced
by
and
grasses
that
spring
up
around
the
mossy
walls
or
in
front
of
the
dripping
with
crystal
beads
furthermore
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
when
the
sunshine
is
poured
down
at
the
required
angle
the
whole
mass
of
the
spray
enveloping
the
fairy
establishment
is
brilliantly
irised
and
it
is
through
so
glorious
a
rainbow
atmosphere
as
this
that
some
of
our
blessed
ouzels
obtain
their
first
peep
at
the
world
ouzels
seem
so
completely
part
and
parcel
of
the
streams
they
inhabit
they
scarce
suggest
any
other
origin
than
the
streams
themselves
and
one
might
almost
be
pardoned
in
fancying
they
come
direct
from
the
living
waters
like
flowers
from
the
ground
at
least
from
whatever
cause
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
look
for
their
nests
until
more
than
a
year
after
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
birds
themselves
although
i
found
one
the
very
day
on
which
i
began
the
search
in
making
my
way
from
yosemite
to
the
glaciers
at
the
heads
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
rivers
i
camped
in
a
particularly
wild
and
romantic
portion
of
the
nevada
cañon
where
in
previous
excursions
i
had
never
failed
to
enjoy
the
company
of
my
favorites
who
were
attracted
here
no
doubt
by
the
safe
in
the
shelving
rocks
and
by
the
abundance
of
food
and
falling
water
the
river
for
miles
above
and
below
consists
of
a
succession
of
small
falls
from
ten
to
sixty
feet
in
height
connected
by
flat
cascades
that
go
flashing
from
fall
to
fall
free
and
almost
channelless
over
waving
folds
of
granite
on
the
south
side
of
one
of
the
falls
that
portion
of
the
precipice
which
is
bathed
by
the
spray
presents
a
series
of
little
shelves
and
tablets
caused
by
the
development
of
planes
of
cleavage
in
the
granite
and
by
the
consequent
fall
of
masses
through
the
action
of
the
water
here
said
i
all
places
is
the
most
charming
spot
for
an
then
carefully
scanning
the
fretted
face
of
the
precipice
through
the
spray
i
at
length
noticed
a
yellowish
growing
on
the
edge
of
a
level
tablet
within
five
or
six
feet
of
the
outer
folds
of
the
fall
but
apart
from
the
fact
of
its
being
situated
where
one
acquainted
with
the
lives
of
ouzels
would
fancy
an
nest
ought
to
be
there
was
nothing
in
its
appearance
visible
at
first
sight
to
distinguish
it
from
other
bosses
of
similarly
situated
with
reference
to
perennial
spray
and
it
was
not
until
i
had
scrutinized
it
again
and
again
and
had
removed
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
crept
along
the
face
of
the
rock
within
eight
or
ten
feet
of
it
that
i
could
decide
certainly
whether
it
was
a
nest
or
a
natural
growth
in
these
moss
huts
three
or
four
eggs
are
laid
white
like
and
well
may
the
little
birds
hatched
from
them
sing
water
songs
for
they
hear
them
all
their
lives
and
even
before
they
are
born
i
have
often
observed
the
young
just
out
of
the
nest
making
their
odd
gestures
and
seeming
in
every
way
as
much
at
home
as
their
experienced
parents
like
young
bees
on
their
first
excursions
to
the
flower
fields
no
amount
of
familiarity
with
people
and
their
ways
seems
to
change
them
in
the
least
to
all
appearance
their
behavior
is
just
the
same
on
seeing
a
man
for
the
first
time
as
when
they
have
seen
him
frequently
illustration
the
ouzel
at
home
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
rivers
where
mills
are
built
they
sing
on
through
the
din
of
the
machinery
and
all
the
noisy
confusion
of
dogs
cattle
and
workmen
on
one
occasion
while
a
was
at
work
on
the
i
observed
one
cheerily
singing
within
reach
of
the
flying
chips
nor
does
any
kind
of
unwonted
disturbance
put
him
in
bad
humor
or
frighten
him
out
of
calm
in
passing
through
a
narrow
gorge
i
once
drove
one
ahead
of
me
from
rapid
to
rapid
disturbing
him
four
times
in
quick
succession
where
he
could
not
very
well
fly
past
me
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
the
channel
most
birds
under
similar
circumstances
fancy
themselves
pursued
and
become
suspiciously
uneasy
but
instead
of
growing
nervous
about
it
he
made
his
usual
dippings
and
sang
one
of
his
most
tranquil
strains
when
observed
within
a
few
yards
their
eyes
are
seen
to
express
remarkable
gentleness
and
intelligence
but
they
seldom
allow
so
near
a
view
unless
one
wears
clothing
of
about
the
same
color
as
the
rocks
and
trees
and
knows
how
to
sit
still
on
one
occasion
while
rambling
along
the
shore
of
a
mountain
lake
where
the
birds
at
least
those
born
that
season
had
never
seen
a
man
i
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
large
stone
close
to
the
edge
upon
which
it
seemed
the
ouzels
and
sandpipers
were
in
the
habit
of
alighting
when
they
came
to
feed
on
that
part
of
the
shore
and
some
of
the
other
birds
also
when
they
came
down
to
wash
or
drink
in
a
few
minutes
along
came
a
whirring
ouzel
and
alighted
on
the
stone
beside
me
within
reach
of
my
hand
then
suddenly
observing
me
he
stooped
nervously
as
if
about
to
fly
on
the
instant
but
as
i
remained
as
motionless
as
the
stone
he
gained
confidence
and
looked
me
steadily
in
the
face
for
about
a
minute
then
flew
quietly
to
the
outlet
and
began
to
sing
next
came
a
sandpiper
and
gazed
at
me
with
much
the
same
guileless
expression
of
eye
as
the
ouzel
lastly
down
with
a
swoop
came
a
jay
out
of
a
probably
with
the
intention
of
moistening
his
noisy
throat
but
instead
of
sitting
confidingly
as
my
other
visitors
had
done
he
rushed
off
at
once
nearly
tumbling
heels
over
head
into
the
lake
in
his
suspicious
confusion
and
with
loud
screams
roused
the
neighborhood
love
for
with
their
sweet
human
voices
appears
to
be
more
common
and
unfailing
than
love
for
flowers
every
one
loves
flowers
to
some
extent
at
least
in
fresh
morning
attracted
by
them
as
instinctively
as
and
bees
even
the
young
digger
indians
have
sufficient
love
for
the
brightest
of
those
found
growing
on
the
mountains
to
gather
them
and
braid
them
as
decorations
for
the
hair
and
i
was
glad
to
discover
through
the
few
indians
that
could
be
induced
to
talk
on
the
subject
that
they
have
names
for
the
wild
rose
and
the
lily
and
other
conspicuous
flowers
whether
available
as
food
or
otherwise
most
men
however
whether
savage
or
civilized
become
apathetic
toward
all
plants
that
have
no
other
apparent
use
than
the
use
of
beauty
but
fortunately
first
instinctive
love
of
is
never
wholly
obliterated
no
matter
what
the
influences
upon
our
lives
may
be
i
have
often
been
delighted
to
see
a
pure
spiritual
glow
come
into
the
countenances
of
hard
and
old
miners
when
a
chanced
to
alight
near
them
nevertheless
the
little
mouthful
of
meat
that
swells
out
the
breasts
of
some
is
too
often
the
cause
of
their
death

the

has
no

so
eager
to
eat

as
to
follow
him

never
knew
him
to

by

an
acquaintance
of
mine
a
sort
of
mountaineer
had
a
pet
cat
a
great
dozy
overgrown
creature
about
as
as
a
lynx
during
the
winter
while
the
snow
lay
deep
the
mountaineer
sat
in
his
lonely
cabin
among
the
pines
smoking
his
pipe
and
wearing
the
dull
time
away
tom
was
his
sole
companion
sharing
his
bed
and
sitting
beside
him
on
a
stool
with
much
the
same
drowsy
expression
of
eye
as
his
master
the
bachelor
was
content
with
his
hard
fare
of
and
bacon
but
tom
the
only
creature
in
the
world
acknowledging
dependence
on
him
must
needs
be
provided
with
fresh
meat
accordingly
he
bestirred
himself
to
contrive
and
waded
the
snowy
woods
with
his
gun
making
sad
havoc
among
the
few
winter
birds
sparing
neither
robin
sparrow
nor
tiny
nuthatch
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
tom
eat
and
grow
fat
was
his
great
reward
one
cold
afternoon
while
hunting
along
the
he
noticed
a
little
bird
skipping
about
in
the
shallows
and
immediately
raised
his
gun
but
just
then
the
confiding
songster
began
to
sing
and
after
listening
to
his
summery
melody
the
charmed
hunter
turned
away
saying
your
little
heart
i
shoot
you
not
even

at
the
foot

cañon
even
so
far
north
as

i
have
found
my
glad
singer
when
i
was
exploring
the
glaciers
between
mount
fairweather
and
the
stikeen
river
one
cold
day
in
november
after
trying
in
vain
to
force
a
way
through
the
innumerable
icebergs
of
sum
dum
bay
to
the
great
glaciers
at
the
head
of
it
i
was
weary
and
baffled
and
sat
resting
in
my
canoe
convinced
at
last
that
i
would
have
to
leave
this
part
of
my
work
for
another
year
then
i
began
to
plan
my
escape
to
open
water
before
the
young
ice
which
was
beginning
to
form
should
shut
me
in
while
i
thus
lingered
drifting
with
the
bergs
in
the
midst
of
these
gloomy
forebodings
and
all
the
terrible
glacial
desolation
and
grandeur
i
suddenly
heard
the
whir
of
an
wings
and
looking
up
saw
my
little
comforter
coming
straight
across
the
ice
from
the
shore
in
a
second
or
two
he
was
with
me
flying
three
times
round
my
head
with
a
happy
salute
as
if
saying
up
old
friend
you
see
here
and
then
he
flew
back
to
the
shore
alighted
on
the
topmost
jag
of
a
stranded
iceberg
and
began
to
nod
and
bow
as
though
he
were
on
one
of
his
favorite
boulders
in
the
midst
of
a
sunny
sierra
cascade
the
species
is
distributed
all
along
the
of
the
pacific
coast
from
alaska
to
mexico
and
east
to
the
rocky
mountains
nevertheless
it
is
as
yet
comparatively
little
known

swainson

i

the

specimens
were
shortly
afterward
procured
by
drummond
near
the
sources
of
the
athabasca
river
between
the

parallels
and
it
has
been
collected
by
nearly
all
of
the
numerous
exploring
expeditions
undertaken
of
late
through
our
western
states

for
it
never
fails
to
engage

in

strength
and

nearly
all
the
lofty
of
the

are
inhabited
by
wild
sheep
most
of
which
on
account
of
the
remote
and
all
but
inaccessible
regions
where
they
dwell
are
imperfectly
known
as
yet
they
are
classified
by
different
naturalists
under
from
five
to
ten
distinct
species
or
varieties
the
best
known
being
the
burrhel
of
the
himalaya
blyth
the
argali
the
large
wild
sheep
of
central
and
northeastern
asia
or
the
corsican

pal
the
aoudad
of
the
mountains
of
northern
africa
and
the
rocky
mountain
bighorn
to
this
species
belongs
the
wild
sheep
of
the
sierra
its
range
according
to
the
late
professor
baird
of
the
smithsonian
institution
extends
the
region
of
the
upper
missouri
and
yellowstone
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
high
grounds
adjacent
to
them
on
the
eastern
slope
and
as
far
south
as
the
rio
grande
westward
it
extends
to
the
coast
ranges
of
washington
oregon
and
california
and
follows
the
highlands
some
distance
into
throughout
the
vast
region
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
wahsatch
mountains
and
on
the
west
by
the
sierra
there
are
more
than
a
hundred
subordinate
ranges
and
mountain
groups
trending
north
and
south
range
beyond
range
with
summits
rising
from
eight
to
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
probably
all
of
which
according
to
my
own
observations
is
or
has
been
inhabited
by
this
species
compared
with
the
argali
which
considering
its
size
and
the
vast
extent
of
its
range
is
probably
the
most
important
of
all
the
wild
sheep
our
species
is
about
the
same
size
but
the
horns
are
less
twisted
and
less
divergent
the
more
important
characteristics
are
however
essentially
the
same
some
of
the
best
naturalists
maintaining
that
the
two
are
only
varied
forms
of
one
species
in
accordance
with
this
view
cuvier
conjectures
that
since
central
asia
seems
to
be
the
region
where
the
sheep
first
appeared
and
from
which
it
has
been
distributed
the
argali
may
have
been
distributed
over
this
continent
from
asia
by
crossing
bering
strait
on
ice
this
conjecture
is
not
so
ill
founded
as
at
first
sight
would
appear
for
the
strait
is
only
about
fifty
miles
wide
is
interrupted
by
three
islands
and
is
jammed
with
ice
nearly
every
winter
furthermore
the
argali
is
abundant
on
the
mountains
adjacent
to
the
strait
at
east
cape
where
it
is
well
known
to
the
tschuckchi
hunters
and
where
i
have
seen
many
of
their
horns
on
account
of
the
extreme
variability
of
the
sheep
under
culture
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
innumerable
domestic
breeds
have
all
been
derived
from
the
few
wild
species
but
the
whole
question
is
involved
in
obscurity
according
to
darwin
sheep
have
been
domesticated
from
a
very
ancient
period
the
remains
of
a
small
breed
differing
from
any
now
known
having
been
found
in
the
famous
swiss
compared
with
the
domestic
breeds
we
find
that
our
wild
species
is
much
larger
and
instead
of
an
garment
wears
a
thick
of
hair
like
that
of
the
deer
and
an
of
fine
wool
the
hair
though
rather
coarse
is
comfortably
soft
and
spongy
and
lies
smooth
as
if
carefully
tended
with
comb
and
brush
the
predominant
color
during
most
of
the
year
is
varying
to
in
the
autumn
the
belly
and
a
large
conspicuous
patch
on
the
buttocks
are
white
and
the
tail
which
is
very
short
like
that
of
a
deer
is
black
with
a
yellowish
border
the
wool
is
white
and
grows
in
beautiful
spirals
down
out
of
sight
among
the
shining
hair
like
delicate
climbing
vines
among
stalks
of
corn
the
horns
of
the
male
are
of
immense
size
measuring
in
their
greater
diameter
from
five
to
six
and
a
half
inches
and
from
two
and
a
half
to
three
feet
in
length
around
the
curve
they
are
in
color
and
ridged
transversely
like
those
of
the
domestic
ram
their
near
the
base
is
somewhat
triangular
in
outline
and
flattened
toward
the
tip
rising
boldly
from
the
top
of
the
head
they
curve
gently
backward
and
outward
then
forward
and
outward
until
about
three
fourths
of
a
circle
is
described
and
until
the
flattened
blunt
tips
are
about
two
feet
or
two
and
a
half
feet
apart
those
of
the
female
are
flattened
throughout
their
entire
length
are
less
curved
than
those
of
the
male
and
much
smaller
measuring

than

the
measurements
of
a
male
obtained
in
the
rocky
mountains
by
audubon
vary
but
little
as
compared
with
the
above
the
weight
of
his
specimen
was
pounds
which
is
perhaps
about
an
average
for
males
the
females
are
about
a
third
lighter
besides
these
differences
in
size
color
hair
as
noted
above
we
may
observe
that
the
domestic
sheep
in
a
general
way
is
expressionless
like
a
dull
bundle
of
something
only
half
alive
while
the
wild
is
as
elegant
and
graceful
as
a
deer
every
movement
manifesting
admirable
strength
and
character
the
tame
is
timid
the
wild
is
bold
the
tame
is
always
more
or
less
ruffled
and
dirty
while
the
wild
is
as
smooth
and
clean
as
the
flowers
of
his
mountain
pastures
the
earliest
mention
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
of
the
wild
sheep
in
america
is
by
father
picolo
a
catholic
missionary
at
monterey
in
the
year
who
after
describing
it
oddly
enough
as
kind
of
deer
with
a
head
and
about
as
large
as
a
calf
one
or
two
years
old
naturally
hurries
on
to
remark
have
eaten
of
these
beasts
their
flesh
is
very
tender
and
mackenzie
in
his
northern
travels
heard
the
species
spoken
of
by
the
indians
as
and
lewis
and
clark
tell
us
that
in
a
time
of
great
scarcity
on
the
head
waters
of
the
missouri
they
saw
plenty
of
wild
sheep
but
they
were
shy
to
be
a
few
of
the
more
energetic
of
the
pah
ute
indians
hunt
the
wild
sheep
every
season
among
the
more
accessible
sections
of
the
high
sierra
in
the
neighborhood
of
passes
where
from
having
been
pursued
they
have
become
extremely
wary
but
in
the
rugged
wilderness
of
peaks
and
cañons
where
the
foaming
tributaries
of
the
san
joaquin
and
rivers
take
their
rise
they
fear
no
hunter
save
the
wolf
and
are
more
guileless
and
approachable
than
their
tame
kindred
while
engaged
in
the
work
of
exploring
high
regions
where
they
delight
to
roam
i
have
been
greatly
interested
in
studying
their
habits
in
the
months
of
november
and
december
and
probably
during
a
considerable
portion
of
midwinter
they
all
flock
together
male
and
female
old
and
young
i
once
found
a
complete
band
of
this
kind
numbering
upward
of
fifty
which
on
being
alarmed
went
bounding
away
across
a
jagged
at
admirable
speed
led
by
a
majestic
old
ram
with
the
lambs
safe
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
in
spring
and
summer
the
rams
form
separate
bands
of
from
three
to
twenty
and
are
usually
found
feeding
along
the
edges
of
glacier
meadows
or
resting
among
the
crags
of
the
high
summits
and
whether
quietly
feeding
or
scaling
the
wild
cliffs
their
noble
forms
and
the
power
and
beauty
of
their
movements
never
fail
to
strike
the
beholder
with
lively
admiration
their
seem
to
be
chosen
with
reference
to
sunshine
and
a
wide
outlook
and
most
of
all
to
safety
their
are
among
the
most
beautiful
of
the
wild
gardens
bright
with
daisies
and
gentians
and
mats
of
purple
bryanthus
lying
hidden
away
on
rocky
headlands
and
cañon
sides
where
sunshine
is
abundant
or
down
in
the
shady
glacier
valleys
along
the
banks
of
the
streams
and
lakes
where
the
plushy
sod
is
greenest
here
they
feast
all
summer
the
happy
wanderers
perhaps
relishing
the
beauty
as
well
as
the
taste
of
the
lovely
flora
on
which
they
feed
illustration
on
mount
shasta
when
the
winter
storms
set
in
loading
their
highland
pastures
with
snow
then
like
the
birds
they
gather
and
go
to
lower
climates
usually
descending
the
eastern
flank
of
the
range
to
the
rough
volcanic
and
treeless
ranges
of
the
great
basin
adjacent

once
i
was
on
mount
shasta
for
three
days
a
little
below
the
timber
line
it
was
a
dark
and
stormy
time
well
calculated
to
test
the
skill
and
endurance
of
mountaineers
the
gale
drove
on
night
and
day
in
hissing
blinding
floods
and
when
at
length
it
began
to
abate
i
found
that
a
small
band
of
wild
sheep
had
weathered
the
storm
in
the
lee
of
a
clump
of
dwarf
pines
a
few
yards
above
my
where
the
snow
was
eight
or
ten
feet
deep
i
was
warm
back
of
a
rock
with
blankets
bread
and
fire
my
brave
companions
lay
in
the
snow
without
food
and
with
only
the
partial
shelter
of
the
short
trees
yet
they
made
no
sign
of
suffering
or
in
the
months
of
may

june
the
wild
sheep
bring
forth
their
young
in
solitary
and
almost
inaccessible
crags
far
above
the
of
the
eagle
i
have
frequently
come
upon
the
beds
of
the
ewes
and
lambs
at
an
elevation
of
from
to
feet
above
these
beds
are
simply
hollows
pawed
out
among
loose
disintegrating
and
sand
upon
some
sunny
spot
commanding
a
good
outlook
and
partially
sheltered
from
the
winds
that
sweep
those
lofty
peaks
almost
without
intermission
such
is
the
cradle
of
the
little
mountaineer
aloft
in
the
very
sky
rocked
in
storms
curtained
in
clouds
sleeping
in
thin
icy
air
but
wrapped
in
his
hairy
coat
and
nourished
by
a
strong
warm
mother
defended
from
the
talons
of
the
eagle
and
the
teeth
of

sly
coyote
the
bonny

grows
apace
he
soon
learns
to
nibble
the
tufted

leaves
of
the
white
spirsea
his
horns
begin
to
shoot
and
before
summer
is
done
he
is
strong
and
agile
and
goes
forth
with
the
flock
watched
by
the
same
divine
love
that
tends
the
more
helpless
human
lamb
in
its
cradle
by
the
fireside
nothing
is
more
commonly
remarked
by
noisy
dusty
in
the
sierra
than
the
want
of
animal
no
deer
no
squirrels
no
game
of
any
kind
they
say
but
if
such
could
only
go
away
quietly
into
the
wilderness
sauntering
afoot
and
alone
with
natural
deliberation
they
would
soon
learn
that
these
mountain
mansions
are
not
without
inhabitants
many
of
whom
confiding

would
not
try
to
shun
their

from

advanced
grouse
kept
rising
from
the

with
a
great
whirring
of
wings
and
alighting
on
the
lower
branches
of
the
pines
and

allowed
a
near
approach
as
if
curious

himself
coming
out
of
a
grove

crossing
the

of

rattled
from

and
the
blessed
ouzel
sang
amid
the
spray
of
every
cascade
where
may
lonely
wanderer
find
a
more
interesting
family
of
companions
and
it
was
afternoon
when
i
joined
them
and
the
glorious
landscape
began
to
fade
in
the
gloaming
before
i
awoke
from
their
enchantment
then
i
sought
a

the
made
a
cupful
of
tea
and
lay
down
to
sleep
on
a
smooth
place
among
the
yellow
leaves
of
an
aspen
grove
next
day
i
discovered
yet
grander
landscapes
and
grander
life
following
the
river
over
huge
swelling
through
a
majestic
cañon
and
past
innumerable
cascades
the
scenery
in
general
became
gradually
wilder
and
more
alpine
the
sugar
pine
and
silver
firs
gave
place
to
the
hardier
cedar
and
hemlock
spruce
the
cañon
walls
became
more
rugged
and
bare
and
gentians
and
arctic
daisies
became
more
abundant
in
the
gardens
and
strips
of
meadow
along
the
streams
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
came
to
another
valley
strikingly
wild
and
original
in
all
its
features
and
perhaps
never
before
touched
by
human
foot
as
regards
area
of
level
it
is
one
of
the
very
smallest
of
the
yosemite
type
but
its
walls
are
sublime
rising
to
a
height
of
from
to
feet
above
the
river
at
the
head
of
the
valley
the
main
cañon
forks
as
is
found
to
be
the
case
in
all
yosemites
the
formation
of
this
one
is
due
chiefly
to
the
action
of
two
great
glaciers
whose
fountains
lay
to
the
eastward
on
the
flanks
of
mounts
humphrey
and
emerson
and
a
cluster
of

peaks

wild

the
gray
river
was
singing
loudly
through
the
valley
but
above
its
massy
roar
i
heard
the
booming
of
a
waterfall
which
drew
me
eagerly
on
and
just
as
i
emerged
from
the
tangled
groves
and
at
the
head
of
the
valley
the
main
fork
of
the
river
came
in
sight
falling
fresh
from
its
glacier
fountains
in
a
snowy
cascade
between
granite
walls
feet
high
the
steep
incline
down
which
the
glad
waters
thundered
seemed
to
bar
all
farther
progress
it
was
not
long
however
before
i
discovered
a
crooked
seam
in
the
rock
by
which
i
was
enabled
to
climb
to
the
edge
of
a
terrace
that
crosses
the
cañon
and
divides
the
cataract
nearly
in
the
middle
here
i
sat
down
to
take
breath
and
make
some
entries
in
my
taking
advantage
at
the
same
time
of
my
elevated
position
above
the
trees
to
gaze
back
over
the
valley
into
the
heart
of
the
noble
landscape
little
knowing
the
while
what
neighbors
were
near
after
spending
a
few
minutes
in
this
way
i
chanced
to
look
across
the
fall
and
there
stood
three
sheep
quietly
observing
me
never
did
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
mountain
or
fall
or
human
friend
more
forcibly
seize
and
rivet
my
attention
anxiety
to
observe
accurately
held
me
perfectly
still
eagerly
i
marked
the
flowing
undulations
of
their
firm
braided
muscles
their
strong
legs
ears
eyes
heads
their
graceful
rounded
necks
the
color
of
their
hair
and
the
bold
upsweeping
curves
of
their
noble
horns
when
they
moved
i
watched
every
gesture
while
they
in
no
wise
disconcerted
either
by
my
attention
or
by
the
tumultuous
roar
of
the
water
advanced
deliberately
alongside
the
rapids
between
the
two
divisions
of
the
cataract
turning
now
and
then
to
look
at
me
presently
they
came
to
a
steep
acclivity
which
they
ascended
by
a
succession
of
quick
short
leaps
reaching
the
top
without
a
struggle
this
was
the
most
startling
feat
of
mountaineering
i
had
ever
witnessed
and
considering
only
the
mechanics
of
the
thing
my
astonishment
could
hardly
have
been
greater
had
they
displayed
wings
and
taken
to
flight
mules
on
such
ground
would
have
fallen
and
rolled
like
loosened
boulders
many
a
time
where
the
slopes
are
far
lower
i
have
been
compelled
to
take
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
tie
them
to
my
belt
and
creep
barefooted
with
the
utmost
caution
no
wonder
then
that
i
watched
the
progress
of
these
animal
mountaineers
with
keen
sympathy
and
exulted
in
the
boundless
sufficiency
of
wild
nature
displayed
in
their
invention
construction
and
keeping
a
few
minutes
later
i
caught
sight
of
a
dozen
more
in
one
band
near
the
foot
of
the
upper
fall
they
were
standing
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
with
me
only
or
thirty
yards
away
looking
as
unworn
and
perfect
as
if
created
on
the
spot
it
appeared
by
their
tracks
which
i
had
seen
in
the
little
yosemite
and
by
their
present
position
that
when
i
came
up
the
cañon
they
were
all
feeding
together
down
in
the
valley
and
in
their
haste
to
reach
high
ground
where
they
could
look
about
them
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
strange
disturbance
they
were
divided
three
ascending
on
one
side
the
river
the
rest
on
the
other
the
main
band
headed
by
an
experienced
chief
now
began
to
cross
the
wild
rapids
between
the
two
divisions
of
the
cascade
this
was
another
exciting
feat
for
among
all
the
varied
experiences
of
mountaineers
the
crossing
of
boisterous
torrents
is
found
to
be
one
of
the
most
trying
to
the
nerves
yet
these
fine
fellows
walked
fearlessly
to
the
brink
and
jumped
from
boulder
to
boulder
holding
themselves
in
easy
poise
above
the
whirling
confusing
current
as
if
they
were
doing
nothing

streaming
up

the

a

made
it
glorious
after
crossing

river
the
dauntless
climbers
led
by
their
chief

once
began
to
scale
the
cañon
wall
turning
now
right
now
left
in
long
single
file
keeping
well
apart
out
of
one
way

leaping
in
regular
succession
from

to
crag

ascending

leisurely
along

edges

at
times
to

down

heads
held
aslant

learn
what
i
thought
about
it
or
whether
i
was
likely
to
follow
them
after
reaching
the
top
of
the
wall
which
at
this
place
is
somewhere
between
and
feet
high
they
were
still
visible
against
the
sky
as
they
lingered
looking
down
in
groups
of
twos
or
threes
throughout
the
entire
ascent
they
did
not
make
a
single
awkward
step
or
an
unsuccessful
effort
of
any
kind
i
have
frequently
seen
tame
sheep
in
mountains
jump
upon
a
sloping
hold
on
tremulously
a
few
seconds
and
fall
back
baffled
and
irresolute
but
in
the
most
trying
situations
where
the
slightest
want
or
inaccuracy
would
have
been
fatal
these
always
seemed
to
move
in
comfortable
reliance
on
their
strength
and
skill
the
limits
of
which
they
never
appeared
to
know
moreover
each
one
of
the
flock
while
following
the
guidance
of
the
most
experienced
yet
climbed
with
intelligent
independence
as
a
perfect
individual
capable
of
separate
existence
whenever
it
should
wish
or
be
compelled
to
withdraw
from
the
little
clan
the
domestic
sheep
on
the
contrary
is
only
a
fraction
of
an
animal
a
whole
flock
being
required
to
form
an
individual
just
as
numerous
flowerets
are
required
to
make

those
shepherds
who
in
summer
drive
their
flocks
to
the
mountain
pastures
and
while
watching
them
night
and
day
have
seen
them
frightened
by
bears
and
storms
and
scattered

in

measure
be
able

appreciate

our
mountaineer
is
said
to
plunge
headlong
down
the
faces
of
sheer
precipices
and
alight
on
his
big
horns
i
know
only
two
hunters
who
claim
to
have
actually
witnessed
this
feat
i
never
was
so
fortunate
they
describe
the
act
as
a
diving
the
horns
are
so
large
at
the
base
that
they
cover
the
upper
portion
of
the
head
down
nearly
to
a
level
with
the
eyes
and
the
skull
is
exceedingly
strong
i
struck
an
old
bleached
specimen
on
mount
ritter
a
dozen
blows
with
my
without
breaking
it
such
skulls
would
not
fracture
very
readily
by
the
wildest
but
other
bones
could
hardly
be
expected
to
hold
together
in
such
a
performance
and
the
mechanical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
controlling
their
movements
after
striking
upon
an
irregular
surface
are
in
themselves
sufficient
to
show
this
method
of
progression
to
be
impossible
even
in
the
absence
of
all
other
evidence
on
the
subject
moreover
the
ewes
follow
wherever
the
rams
may
lead
although
their
horns
are
mere
spikes
i
have
found
many
pairs
of
the
horns
of
the
old
rams
considerably
battered
doubtless
a
result
of
fighting
i
was
particularly
interested
in
the
question
after
witnessing
the
performances
of
this
san
joaquin
band
upon
the
glaciated
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
and
as
soon
as
i
procured
specimens
and
examined
their
feet
all
the
mystery
disappeared
the
secret
considered
in
connection
with
exceptionally
strong
muscles
is
simply
this
the
wide
posterior
portion
of
the
bottom
of
the
foot
instead
of
wearing
down
and
becoming
flat
and
hard
like

horses

out
in
a
soft
pad
or
cushion
which
not
only
grips
and
holds
well
on
smooth
rocks
but
fits
into
small
cavities
and
down
upon
or
against
slight
protuberances
even
the
hardest
portions
of
the
edge
of
the
hoof
are
comparatively
soft
and
elastic
furthermore
the
toes
admit
of
an
extraordinary
amount
of
both
lateral
and
vertical
movement
allowing
the
foot
to
accommodate
itself
still
more
perfectly
to
the
irregularities
of
rock
surfaces

a
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
their
diving
habits
he
pointed
to
the
front
of
a
lava
headland
about
feet
high
which
is
only
eight

ten
degrees
out

expected
to
capture
them

got
behind
them
on
a
narrow
bench
that
runs
along
the
face
of
the
wall
near
the
top
and
comes
to
an
end
where
they
get
away
without
falling
and
being
killed

they
jumped
off
and
landed
all
right

if
that
were
the
regular
thing

said

you

replied

i
was
behind

but
i
saw
them
go
off
over
the
brink
and
then
i
went
below

found
their

they
struck

just

being

were
seen
jumping
down
in

happened
to
be

could
watch

mountaineering

found
small

built

i

learned
one

more
indians
would
lie
in
wait
while
their
companions
scoured
the
ridges
below
knowing
that
the
alarmed
sheep
would
surely
run
to
the
summit

sheep
is
the
rocky
mountain
goat
rich
which
as
its
name
indicates
is
more
antelope
than
goat
he
too
is
a
brave
and
hardy
climber
fearlessly
crossing
the
wildest
summits
and
braving
the
severest
storms
but
he
is
shaggy
and
much
less
dignified
in
demeanor
than
the
sheep
his
horns
are
only
about
five
or
six
inches
in
length
and
the
long
white
hair
with
which
he
is
covered
obscures
the
expression
of
his
limbs
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
single
specimen
in
the
sierra
though
possibly
a
few
flocks
may
have
lived
on
mount
shasta
a
comparatively
short
time
ago
the
ranges
of
these
two
mountaineers
are
pretty
distinct
and
they
see
but
little
of
each
other
the
sheep
being
restricted
mostly
to
the
dry
inland
mountains
the
goat
or
chamois
to
the
wet
snowy
mountains
of
the
northwest
coast
of
the
continent
in
oregon
washington
british
columbia
and
alaska
probably
more
than
dwell
on
the
icy
volcanic
cone
of
mount
rainier
and
while
i
was
exploring
the
glaciers
of
alaska
i
saw
flocks
of
these
admirable
mountaineers
nearly
every
day
and
often
followed
their
trails
through
the
mazes
of
bewildering
crevasses
in
which
they
are
excellent
guides
three
species
of
deer
are
found
in
california
and
mule
deer
the
first
mentioned
is
by
far
the
most
abundant
and
occasionally
meets
the
sheep
during
the
summer
on
high
glacier
meadows
and
along
the
edge
of
the
timber
line
but
being
a
forest
animal
seeking
shelter
and
rearing
its
young
in
dense
thickets
it
seldom
visits
the
wild
sheep
in
its
higher
homes
the
antelope
though
not
a
mountaineer
is
occasionally
met
in
winter
by
the
sheep
while
feeding
along
the
edges
of
the
and
bare
volcanic
hills
to
the
east
of
the
sierra
so
also
is
the
mule
deer
which
is
almost
restricted
in
its
range
to
this
eastern
region
the
species
belongs
to
the
coast
ranges
perhaps
no
wild
animal
in
the
world
is
without
enemies
but
highlanders
as
a
class
have
fewer
than
lowlanders
the
wily
panther
slipping
and
crouching
among
long
grass
and
bushes
pounces
upon
the
antelope
and
deer
but
seldom
crosses
the
bald
craggy
thresholds
of
the
sheep
neither
can
the
bears
be
regarded
as
enemies
for
though
they
seek
to
vary
their
diet
of
nuts
and
berries
by
an
occasional
meal
of
mutton
they
prefer
to
hunt
tame
and
helpless
flocks
eagles
and
coyotes
no
doubt
capture
an
unprotected
lamb
at
times
or
some
unfortunate
beset
in
deep
soft
snow
but
these
cases
are
little
more
than
accidents
so
also
a
few
perish
in
though
in
all
my
mountaineering
i
have
not
found
more
than
five
or
six
that
seemed
to
have
met
their
fate
in
this
way
a
little
band
of
three
were
discovered
in
bloody
canon
a
few
years
ago
and
were
killed
with
an
ax
by
mountaineers
who
chanced
to
be
crossing
the
range
in
winter
man
is
the
most
dangerous
enemy
of
all
but
even
from
him
our
brave
has
little
to
fear
in
the
remote
solitudes
of
the
high
sierra
the
golden
plains
of
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
were
lately
thronged
with
bands
of
elk
and
antelope
but
being
fertile
and
accessible
they
were
required
for
human
pastures
so
also
are
many
of
the
of
the
valley
forest
and
it
will
be
long
before
man
will
care
to
take
the
highland
castles
of
the
sheep
and
when
we
consider
here
how
rapidly
entire
species
of
noble
animals
such
as
the
elk
moose
and
buffalo
are
being
pushed
to
the
very
verge
of
extinction
all
lovers
of
wildness
will
rejoice
with
me
in
the
rocky
security
of
the
bravest
of
all
the

mountaineers

in
the
sierra
camp
is
a
curious
old
in
calaveras
county
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
sea
situated
like
a
nest
in
the
center
of
a
rough
gravelly
region
rich
in
gold
granites
slates
lavas
limestone
iron
ores
quartz
veins
auriferous
gravels
remnants
of
dead
and
dead
are
developed
here
side
by
side
within
a
radius
of
a
few
miles
and
placed
invitingly
open
before
the
student
like
a
book
while
the
people
and
the
region
beyond
the
camp
furnish
mines
of
study
of
interest
and
variety
when
i
discovered
this
curious
place
i
was
tracing
the
channels
of
the
ancient
rivers
instructive
sections
of
which
have
been
laid
bare
here
and
in
the
adjacent
regions
by
the
miners
rivers
according
to
the
poets
on
but
those
of
the
sierra
are
young
as
yet
and
have
scarcely
learned
the
way
down
to
the
sea
while
at
least
one
generation
of
them
have
died
and
vanished
together
with
most
of
the
basins
they
drained
all
that
remains
of
them
to
tell
their
history
is
a
series
of
interrupted
fragments
of
channels
mostly
choked
with
gravel
and
buried
beneath
broad
thick
sheets
of
lava
these
are
known
as
the
rivers
of
california
and
the
gravel
deposited
in
them
is
comprehensively
called
the
in
some
places
the
channels
of
the
present
rivers
trend
in
the
same
direction
or
nearly
so
as
those
of
the
ancient
rivers
but
in
general
there
is
little
correspondence
between
them
the
entire
drainage
having
been
changed
or
rather
made
new
many
of
the
hills
of
the
ancient
landscapes
have
become
hollows
and
the
old
hollows
have
become
hills
therefore
the
fragmentary
channels
with
their
loads
of
auriferous
gravel
occur
in
all
kinds
of
places
trending
obliquely
or
even
at
right
angles
to
the
present
drainage
across
the
tops
of
lofty
ridges
or
far
beneath
them
presenting
impressive
illustrations
of
the
magnitude
of
the
changes
accomplished
since
those
ancient
streams
were
annihilated
the
last
volcanic
period
preceding
the
regeneration
of
the
sierra
landscapes
seems
to
have
come
on
over
all
the
range
almost
simultaneously
like
the
glacial
period
notwithstanding
lavas
of
different
age
occur
together
in
many
places
indicating
numerous
periods
of
activity
in
the
sierra
the
most
important
of
the
ancient
in
this
region
is
a
section
that
extends
from
the
south
side
of
the
town
beneath
coyote
creek
and
the
ridge
beyond
it
to
the
cañon
of
the
stanislaus
but
on
account
of
its
depth
below
the
general
surface
of
the
present
valleys
the
rich
gold
gravels
it
is
known
to
contain
can
not
be
easily
worked
on
a
large
scale
their
extraordinary
richness
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
many
claims
were
profitably
worked
in
them
by
sinking
shafts
to
a
depth
of
feet
or
more
and
hoisting
the
dirt
by
a
windlass
should
the
dip
of
this
ancient
channel
be
such
as
to
make
the
stanislaus
cañon
available
as
a
dump
then
the
grand
deposit
might
be
worked
by
the
hydraulic
method
and
although
a
long
expensive
tunnel
would
be
required
the
scheme
might
still
prove
profitable
for
there
is
in
the
importance
of
these
ancient
gravels
as
gold
fountains
is
well
known
to
miners
even
the
superficial
placers
of
the
present
streams
have
derived
much
of
their
gold
from
them
according
to
all
accounts
the
murphy
placers
have
been
very
rich
as
they
say
here
the
hills
have
been
cut
and
scalped
and
every
gorge
and
gulch
and
valley
torn
to
pieces
and
disemboweled
expressing
a
fierce
and
desperate
energy
hard
to
understand
still
any
kind
of
is
better
than
inaction
and
there
is
something
sublime
in
seeing
men
working
in
dead
earnest
at
anything
pursuing
an
object
with
energy
and
persistence
many
a
brave
fellow
has
recorded
a
most
eventful
chapter
of
life
on
these
calaveras
rocks
but
most
of
the
pioneer
miners
are
sleeping
now
their
wild
day
done
while
the
few
survivors
linger
languidly
in
the
gulches
or
sleepy
village
like
harried
bees
around
the
ruins
of
their
hive
have
no
industry
left
they
told
me
no
men
everybody
and
everything
hereabouts
has
gone
to
decay
we
are
only
of
the
game
a
thin
of
poor
dilapidated
cusses
compared
with
what
we
used
to
be
in
the
grand
old
we
were
giants
then
and
you
can
look
around
here
and
see
our
but
although
these
lingering
pioneers
are
perhaps
more
exhausted
than
the
mines
and
about
as
dead
as
the
dead
rivers
they
are
yet
a
rare
and
interesting
set
of
men
with
much
gold
mixed
with
the
rough
rocky
gravel
of
their
characters
and
they
manifest
a
breeding
and
intelligence
little
looked
for
in
such
surroundings
as
theirs
as
the
heavy
grinding
of
the
glaciers
brought
out
the
features
of
the
sierra
so
the
intense
experiences
of
the
gold
period
have
brought
out
the
features
of
these
old
miners
forming
a
richness
and
variety
of
character
little
known
as
yet
the
sketches
of
bret
harte
hayes
and
miller
have
not
exhausted
this
field
by
any
means
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
extremes
possible
in
one
and
the
same
character
harshness
and
gentleness
manliness
and
childishness
apathy
and
fierce
endeavor
men
who
twenty
years
ago
would
not
cease
their
shoveling
to
save
their
lives
now
play
in
the
streets
with
children
their
long
waiting
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
placers
has
brought
on
an
exaggerated
form
of
dotage
i
heard
a
group
of
brawny
pioneers
in
the
street
eagerly
discussing
the
quantity
of
tail
required
for
a
kite
and
one
graybeard
undertook
the
sport
of
flying
it
volunteering
the
information
that
he
was
a
boy
was
a
boy
and
a
man
who
was
not
a
boy
inside
however
ancient
outside
mines
morals
politics
the
immortality
of
the
soul
were
discussed
beneath
and
in
saloons
the
time
for
each
being
governed
apparently
by
the
temperature
contact
with
nature
and
the
habits
of
observation
acquired
in
had
made
them
all
to
some
extent
collectors
and
like
they
had
gathered
all
kinds
of
odd
specimens
into
their
cabins
and
now
required
me
to
examine
them
they
were
themselves
the
oddest
and
most
interesting
specimens
one
of
them
offered
to
show
me
around
the
old
diggings
giving
me
fair
warning
before
setting
out
that
i
might
not
like
him
said
he
say
eccentric
i
notice
everything
and
gather
beetles
and
snakes
and
anything
queer
and
so
some
like
me
and
call
me
eccentric
always
trying
to
find
out
things
now
a
weed
the
indians
eat
it
for
greens
what
do
you
call
those
flies
with
big
heads
i
suggested
their
jaws
work
sidewise
instead
of
up
and
down
and
jaws
work
the
same
way
and
therefore
i
think
they
are
the
same
species
i
always
notice
everything
like
that
and
just
because
i
do
they
say
eccentric
etc
anxious
that
i
should
miss
none
of
the
wonders
of
their
old
the
good
people
had
much
to
say
about
the
marvelous
beauty
of
cave
city
cave
and
advised
me
to
explore
it
this
i
was
very
glad
to
do
and
finding
a
guide
who
knew
the
way
to
the
mouth
of
it
i
set
out
from
murphy
the
next
morning
the
most
beautiful
and
extensive
of
the
mountain
caves
of
california
occur
in
a
belt
of
metamorphic
limestone
that
is
pretty
generally
developed
along
the
western
flank
of
the
sierra
from
the
mccloud
river
on
the
north
to
the
kaweah
on
the
south
a
distance
of
over
miles
at
an
elevation
of
from
to
feet
above
the
sea
besides
this
regular
belt
of
caves
the
california
landscapes
are
diversified
by
long
imposing
ranks
of
rugged
and
variable
in
architecture
carved
in
the
coast
headlands
and
precipices
by
centuries
of
and
innumerable
great
and
small
originating
in
the
unequal
flowing
and
hardening
of
the
lava
sheets
in
which
they
occur
fine
illustrations
of
which
are
presented
in
the
famous
modoc
lava
beds
and
around
the
base
of
icy
shasta
in
this
comprehensive
glance
we
may
also
notice
the
shallow
caves
in
stratified
sandstones
along
the
margins
of
the
plains
and
the
recesses
in
the
sierra
slates
and
granites
where
bears
and
other
mountaineers
find
shelter
during
the
fall
of
sudden
storms
in
general
however
the
grand
massive
uplift
of
the
sierra
as
far
as
it
has
been
to
observation
is
about
as
solid
and
caveless
as
a
boulder
fresh
beauty
opens
eyes
wherever
it
is
really
seen
but
the
very
abundance
and
completeness
of
the
common
beauty
that
besets
our
steps
prevents
its
being
absorbed
and
appreciated
it
is
a
good
thing
therefore
to
make
short
excursions
now
and
then
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
among
dulse
and
coral
or
up
among
the
clouds
on
or
in
balloons
or
even
to
creep
like
worms
into
dark
holes
and
caverns
underground
not
only
to
learn
something
of
what
is
going
on
in
those
places
but
to
see
better
what
the
sun
sees
on
our
return
to
common
beauty
our
way
from
to
the
cave
lay
across
a
series
of
picturesque
moory
ridges
in
the
chaparral
region
between
the
brown
and
the
forests
a
flowery
stretch
of
rolling
breaking
here
and
there
into
a
kind
of
rocky
foam
on
the
higher
summits
and
sinking
into
delightful
bosky
hollows
embowered
with
vines
the
day
was
a
fine
specimen
of
california
summer
pure
sunshine
unshaded
most
of
the
time
by
a
single
cloud
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
heated
air
began
to
flow
in
tremulous
waves
from
every
southern
slope
the
that
usually
comes
up
the
at
this
season
with
cooling
on
its
wings
was
scarcely
perceptible
the
birds
were
assembled
beneath
leafy
shade
or
made
short
languid
flights
in
search
of
food
all
save
the
majestic
buzzard
with
broad
wings
outspread
he
sailed
the
warm
air
unwearily
from
ridge
to
ridge
seeming
to
enjoy
the
fervid
sunshine
like
a
butterfly
squirrels
too
whose
spicy
ardor
no
heat
or
cold
may
abate
were
nutting
among
the
pines
and
the
innumerable
hosts
of
the
insect
kingdom
were
throbbing
and
wavering
unwearied
as
sunbeams
this
brushy
region
used
to
be
a
deer
and
bear
pasture
but
since
the
disturbances
of
the
gold
period
these
fine
animals
have
almost
wholly
disappeared
here
also
once
roamed
the
mastodon
and
elephant
whose
bones
are
found
entombed
in
the
river
gravels
and
beneath
thick
folds
of
lava
toward
noon
as
we
were
riding
slowly
over
bank
and
brae
basking
in
the
unfeverish
we
witnessed
the
upheaval
of
a
new
a
sierra
of
clouds
abounding
in
landscapes
as
truly
sublime
and
only
we
have
a
mind
to
think
so
and
eyes
to
the
more
ancient
rocky
sierra
beneath
it
with
its
forests
and
waterfalls
reminding
us
that
as
there
is
a
lower
world
of
caves
so
also
there
is
an
upper
world
of
clouds
huge
bossy
cumuli
developed
with
astonishing
rapidity
from
mere
buds
swelling
with
visible
motion
into
colossal
mountains
and
piling
higher
higher
in
long
massive
ranges
peak
beyond
peak
dome
over
dome
with
many
a
picturesque
valley
and
shadowy
cave
between
while
the
dark
firs
and
pines
of
the
upper
benches
of
the
sierra
were
projected
against
their
pearl
bosses
with
exquisite
clearness
of
outline
these
cloud
mountains
vanished
in
the
azure
as
quickly
as
they
were
developed
leaving
no
detritus
but
they
were
not
a
whit
less
real
or
interesting
on
this
account
the
more
enduring
hills
over
which
we
rode
were
vanishing
as
surely
as
they
only
not
so
fast
a
difference
which
is
great
or
small
according
to
the
standpoint
from
which
it
is
contemplated
at
the
bottom
of
every
dell
we
found
little
homesteads
embosomed
in
wild
brush
and
vines
wherever
the
recession
of
the
hills
left
patches
of
arable
ground
these
secluded
flats
are
settled
mostly
by
italians
and
germans
who
plant
a
few
vegetables
and
at
odd
times
while
their
main
business
is
mining
and
prospecting
in
spite
of
all
the
natural
beauty
of
these
dell
cabins
they
can
hardly
be
called
homes
they
are
only
a
better
kind
of
camp
gladly
abandoned
whenever
the
gold
harvest
has
been
gathered
there
is
an
air
of
profound
unrest
and
melancholy
about
the
best
of
them
their
beauty
is
thrust
upon
them
by
exuberant
nature
apart
from
which
they
are
only
a
few
logs
and
boards
rudely
jointed
and
without
either
ceiling
or
floor
a
rough
fireplace
with
corresponding
cooking
utensils
a
and

the
ground
about
them
is
strewn
with
battered
picks
and
quartz
specimens
from
many
a
ledge
indicating
the
trend
of
their
hard
lives
the
ride
from
to
the
cave
is
scarcely
two
hours
long
but
we
lingered
among
and
banks
of
dead
river
gravel
until
long
after
noon
at
length
emerging
from
a
gorge
a
small
house
came
in
sight
set
in
a
thicket
of
at
the
base
of
a
limestone
hill
said
my
guide
pointing
to
the
house
cave
city
and
the
cave
is
in
that
gray
arriving
at
the
one
house
of
this
city
we
were
boisterously
welcomed
by
three
drunken
men
who
had
come
to
town
to
hold
a
spree
the
mistress
of
the
house
tried
to
keep
order
and
in
reply
to
our
inquiries
told
us
that
the
cave
guide
was
then
in
the
cave
with
a
party
of
ladies
must
we
wait
until
he
returns
we
asked
no
that
was
unnecessary
we
might
take
candles
and
go
into
the
cave
alone
provided
we
shouted
from
time
to
time
so
as
to
be
found
by
the
guide
and
were
careful
not
to
fall
over
the
rocks
or
into
the
dark
pools
accordingly
taking
a
trail
from
the
house
we
were
led
around
the
base
of
the
hill
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
a
small
inconspicuous
archway
mossy
around
the
edges
and
shaped
like
the
door
of
a
nest
with
no
appreciable
hint
or
advertisement
of
the
grandeur
of
the
many
crystal
chambers
within
lighting
our
candles
which
seemed
to
have
no
illuminating
power
in
the
thick
darkness
we
groped
our
way
onward
as
best
we
could
along
narrow
lanes
and
alleys
from
chamber
to
chamber
around
rustic
columns
and
heaps
of
fallen
rocks
stopping
to
rest
now
and
then
in
particularly
beautiful
alcoves
furnished
with
admirable
variety
of
shelves
and
tables
and
round
bossy
stools
covered
with
sparkling
crystals
some
of
the
corridors
were
muddy
and
in
plodding
along
these
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
streets
of
some
prairie
village
in
then
we
would
come
to
handsome
marble
stairways
conducting
right
and
left
into
upper
chambers
ranged
above
one
another
three
or
four
stories
high
floors
ceilings
and
walls
lavishly
decorated
with
innumerable
crystalline
forms
after
thus
wandering
exploringly
and
alone
for
a
mile
or
so
fairly
enchanted
a
murmur
of
voices
and
a
gleam
of
light
betrayed
the
approach
of
the
guide
and
his
party
from
whom
when
they
came
up
we
received
a
most
hearty
and
natural
stare
as
we
stood
half
concealed
in
a
side
recess
among
stalagmites
i
ventured
to
ask
the
dripping
crouching
company
how
they
had
enjoyed
their
saunter
anxious
to
learn
how
the
strange
sunless
scenery
of
the
underworld
had
impressed
them
nice
splendid
they
all
replied
and
echoed
bridal
chamber
back
here
is
just
glorious
this
morning
we
came
down
from
the
calaveras
big
tree
grove
and
the
trees
are
nothing
to
after
making
this
curious
comparison
they
hastened
sunward
the
guide
promising
to
join
us
shortly
on
the
bank
of
a
deep
pool
where
we
were
to
wait
for
him
this
is
a
charming
little
lakelet
of
unknown
depth
never
yet
stirred
by
a
breeze
and
its
eternal
calm
excites
the
imagination
even
more
profoundly
than
the
silvery
lakes
of
the
glaciers
rimmed
with
meadows
and
snow
and
reflecting
sublime
mountains
our
guide
a
jolly
rollicking
italian
led
us
into
the
heart
of
the
hill
up
and
down
right
and
left
from
chamber
to
chamber
more
and
more
magnificent
all
like
a
glacier
cave
with
stalactites
and
stalagmites
combined
in
forms
of
indescribable
beauty
we
were
shown
one
large
room
that
was
occasionally
used
as
a
another
that
was
used
as
a
chapel
with
natural
pulpit
and
crosses
and
pews
sermons
in
every
stone
where
a
priest
had
said
mass
is
not
so
generally
developed
in
connection
with
natural
wonders
as
dancing
one
of
the
first
conceits
excited
by
the
giant
sequoias
was
to
cut
one
of
them
down
and
dance
on
its
stump
we
have
also
seen
dancing
in
the
spray
of
niagara
dancing
in
the
famous
bower
cave
above
coulterville
and
nowhere
have
i
seen
so
much
dancing
as
in
yosemite
a
dance
on
the
inaccessible
south
dome
would
likely
follow
the
making
of
an
easy
way
to
the
top
of
it
it
was
delightful
to
witness
here
the
infinite
deliberation
of
nature
and
the
simplicity
of
her
methods
in
the
production
of
such
mighty
results
such
perfect
repose
combined
with
restless
enthusiastic
energy
though
cold
and
bloodless
as
a
landscape
of
polar
ice
building
was
going
on
in
the
dark
with
incessant
activity
the
archways
and
ceilings
were
everywhere
hung
with
crystals
like
inverted
groves
of
leafless
saplings
some
of
them
large
others
delicately
attenuated
each
tipped
with
a
single
drop
of
water
like
the
terminal
bud
of
a
the
only
appreciable
sounds
were
the
dripping
and
tinkling
of
water
failing
into
pools
or
faintly
plashing
on
the
crystal
floors
in
some
places
the
crystal
decorations
are
arranged
in
graceful
flowing
folds
deeply
plicated
like
stiff
silken
drapery
in
others
straight
lines
of
the
ordinary
stalactite
forms
are
combined
with
reference
to
size
and
tone
in
a
regularly
graduated
system
like
the
strings
of
a
harp
with
musical
tones
corresponding
thereto
and
on
these
stone
harps
we
played
by
striking
the
crystal
strings
with
a
stick
the
delicious
liquid
tones
they
gave
forth
seemed
perfectly
divine
as
they
sweetly
whispered
and
wavered
through
the
majestic
halls
and
died
away
in
faintest
cadence
music
of
here
we
lingered
and
reveled
rejoicing
to
find
so
much
music
in
stony
silence
so
much
splendor
in
darkness
so
many
mansions
in
the
depths
of
the
mountains
buildings
ever
in
process
of
construction
yet
ever
finished
developing
from
perfection
to
perfection
profusion
without
overabundance
every
particle
visible
or
invisible
in
glorious
motion
marching
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
in
a
region
regarded
as
the
abode
of
eternal
stillness
and
death
the
outer
chambers
of
mountain
caves
are
frequently
selected
as
homes
by
wild
beasts
in
the
sierra
however
they
seem
to
prefer
homes
and
in
chaparral
and
beneath
shelving
precipices
as
i
have
never
seen
their
tracks
in
any
of
the
caves
this
is
the
more
remarkable
because
notwithstanding
the
darkness
and
oozing
water
there
is
nothing
uncomfortably
or
sepulchral
about
them
when
we
emerged
into
the
bright
landscapes
of
the
sun
everything
looked
brighter
and
we
felt
our
faith
in
beauty
strengthened
and
saw
more
clearly
that
beauty
is
universal
and
immortal
above
beneath
on
land
and
sea
mountain
and
plain

heat
and
cold

of

the

central
plain
of
california
during
the
months
of
march
april
and
may
was
one
smooth
continuous
bed
of
so
marvelously
rich
that
in
walking
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
a
distance
of
more
than
miles
your
foot
would
press
about
a
hundred
flowers
at
every
step

and
innumerable
compositae
were
so
crowded
together
that
had

of

been
taken

would
still
have
seemed
to
any
but
californians
extravagantly
flowery
the
radiant
honeyful
corollas
touching
and
overlapping
and
rising
above
one
another
glowed
in
the
living
light
like
a
sunset
sheet
of
purple
and
gold
with
the
bright
sacramento
pouring
through
the
midst
of
it
from
the
north
the
san
joaquin
from
the
south
and
their
many
tributaries
sweeping
in
at
right
angles
from
the
mountains
dividing
the
plain
into
sections
fringed
with
trees
along
the
rivers
there
is
a
strip
of
countersunk
beneath
the
general
level
and
wider
toward
the
where
magnificent
oaks
from
three
to
eight
feet
in
diameter
cast
grateful
masses
of
shade
over
the
open
levels
and
close
along
the
edge
there
was
a
fine
jungle
of
tropical
luxuriance
composed
of
and
bramble
bushes
and
a
great
variety
of
climbing
vines
wreathing
and
interlacing
the
branches
and
trunks
of
willows
and
alders
and
swinging
across
from
summit
to
summit
in
heavy
festoons
here
the
wild
bees
reveled
in
fresh
bloom
long
after
the
flowers
of
the
drier
plain
had
withered
and
gone
to
seed
and
in
midsummer
when
the
were
ripe
the
indians
came
from
the
mountains
to
women
and
babies
in
long
noisy
trains
often
joined
by
the
farmers
of
the
neighborhood
who
gathered
this
wild
fruit
with
commendable
appreciation
of
its
superior
flavor
while
their
home
orchards
were
full
of
ripe
peaches
apricots
nectarines
and
figs
and
their
vineyards
were
laden
with
grapes
but
though
these
luxuriant
shaggy
were
thus
distinct
from
the
smooth
treeless
plain
they
made
no
heavy
dividing
lines
in
general
views
the
whole
appeared
as
one
continuous
sheet
of
bloom
bounded
only
by
the
mountains
when
i
first
saw
this
central
garden
the
most
extensive
and
regular
of
all
the
of
the
state
it
seemed
all
one
sheet
of
plant
gold
hazy
and
vanishing
in
the
distance
distinct
as
a
new
map
along
the
at
my
feet
descending
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
coast
range
through
beds
of
gilias
and
lupines
and
around
many
a
breezy
hillock
and
headland
i
at
length
waded
out
into
the
midst
of
it
all
the
ground
was
covered
not
with
grass
and
green
leaves
but
with
radiant
corollas
about
next
the
or
more
five
or
six
miles
out
here
were
bahia
madia
madaria
burrielia
chrysopsis
corethrogyne
grindelia
growing
in
close
social
congregations
of
various
shades
of
yellow
blending
finely
with
the
purples
of
clarkia
orthocarpus
and
oenothera
whose
delicate
petals
were
drinking
the
vital
sunbeams
without
giving
back
any
sparkling
glow
illustration
a
in
lower
california
because
so
long
a
period
of
extreme
drought
succeeds
the
rainy
season
most
of
the
vegetation
is
composed
of
annuals
which
spring
up
simultaneously
and
bloom
together
at
about
the
same
height
above
the
ground
the
general
surface
being
but
slightly
ruffled
by
the
taller
phacelias
pentstemons
and
groups
of
the
king
of
the
mints
sauntering
in
any
direction
hundreds
of
these
happy
brushed
against
my
feet
at
every
step
and
closed
over
them
as
if
i
were
wading
in
liquid
gold
the
air
was
sweet
with
fragrance
the
larks
sang
their
blessed
songs
rising
on
the
wing
as
i
advanced
then
sinking
out
of
sight
in
the
polleny
sod
while
myriads
of
wild
bees
stirred
the
lower
air
with
their
monotonous
yet
forever
fresh
and
sweet
as
sunshine
hares
and
spermophiles
showed
themselves
in
considerable
numbers
in
shallow
places
and
small
bands
of
antelopes
were
almost
constantly
in
sight
gazing
curiously
from
some
slight
elevation
and
then
bounding
swiftly
away
with
unrivaled
grace
of
motion
yet
i
could
discover
no
crushed
flowers
to
mark
their
track
nor
indeed
any
destructive
action
of
any
wild
foot
or
tooth
whatever
the
great
yellow
days
circled
by
uncounted
while
i
drifted
toward
the
north
observing
the
countless
forms
of
life
thronging
about
me
lying
down
almost
anywhere
on
the
approach
of
night
and
what
glorious
botanical
beds
i
had
oftentimes
on
awaking
i
would
find
several
new
species
leaning
over
me
and
looking
me
full
in
the
face
so
that
my
studies
would
begin
before
rising
about
the
first
of
may
i
turned
eastward
crossing
the
san
joaquin
river
between
the
mouths
of
the
tuolumne
and
merced
and
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
sierra
most
of
the
vegetation
had
gone
to
seed
and
become
as
dry
as
hay
all
the
seasons
of
the
great
plain
are
warm
or
temperate
and
are
never
wholly
wanting
but
the
grand
annual
governed
by
the
rains
which
usually
set
in
about
the
middle
of
november
or
the
beginning
of
december
then
the
seeds
that
for
six
months
have
lain
on
the
ground
dry
and
fresh
as
if
they
had
been
gathered
into
barns
at
once
unfold
their
treasured
life
the
general
brown
and
purple
of
the
ground
and
the
dead
vegetation
of
the
preceding
year
give
place
to
the
green
of
mosses
and
liverworts
and
myriads
of
young
leaves
then
one
species
after
another
comes
into
flower
gradually
overspreading
the
green
with
yellow
and
purple
which
lasts
until
may
the
is
by
no
means
a
gloomy
soggy
period
of
constant
cloudiness
and
rain
perhaps
nowhere
else
in
north
america
perhaps
in
the
world
are
the
months
of
december
january
february
and
march
so
full
of
bland
sunshine
referring
to
my
notes
of
the
winter
and
spring
of
every
day
of
which
i
spent
out
of
doors
on
that
section
of
the
plain
lying
between
the
tuolumne
and
merced
rivers
i
find
that
the
first
rain
of
the
season
fell
on
december
january
had
only
six
rainy
is
days
on
which
rain
fell
february
three
march
five
april
three
and
may
three
completing
the
rainy
season
which
was
about
an
average
one
the
ordinary
of
this
region
is
seldom
very
cold
or
violent
the
winds
which
in
settled
weather
come
from
the
northwest
veer
round
into
the
opposite
direction
the
sky
fills
gradually
and
evenly
with
one
general
cloud
from
which
the
rain
falls
steadily
often
for
days
in
succession
at
a
temperature
of
about
or
more
than
per
cent
of
all
the
rain
of
this
season
came
from
the
northwest
down
the
coast
over
southeastern
alaska
british
columbia
washington
and
oregon
though
the
local
winds
of
these
circular
storms
blow
from
the
southeast
one
magnificent
local
storm
from
the
northwest
fell
on
march
a
massive
cloud
came
swelling
and
thundering
over
the
flowery
plain
in
most
imposing
majesty
its
bossy
front
burning
white
and
purple
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
while
warm
rain
poured
from
its
ample
fountains
like
a
cataract
beating
down
flowers
and
bees
and
flooding
the
dry
watercourses
as
suddenly
as
those
of
nevada
are
flooded
by
the
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
not
a
trace
of
the
heavy
was
left
in
the
sky
and
the
bees
were
on
the
wing
as
if
nothing
more
gratefully
refreshing
could
have
been
sent
them
by
the
end
of
january
four
species
of
plants
were
in
flower
and
five
or
six
mosses
had
already
adjusted
their
hoods
and
were
in
the
prime
of
life
but
the
flowers
were
not
sufficiently
numerous
as
yet
to
affect
greatly
the
general
green
of
the
young
leaves
violets
made
their
appearance
in
the
first
week
of
february
and
toward
the
end
of
this
month
the
warmer
portions
of
the
plain
were
already
golden
with
myriads
of
the
flowers
of
rayed
composite
this
was
the
full
springtime
the
sunshine
grew
warmer
and
richer

plants
bloomed
every
day
the
air
became
more
tuneful
with
humming
wings
and
sweeter
with
the
fragrance
of
the
opening
flowers
ants
and
ground
squirrels
were
getting
ready
for
their
summer
work
rubbing
their
benumbed
limbs
and
sunning
themselves
on
the
before
their
doors
and
spiders
were
busy
mending
their
old
webs
or
weaving
new
ones
in
march
the
vegetation
was
more
than
doubled
in
depth
and
color
claytonia
calandrinia
a
large
white
gilia
and
two
nemophilas
were
in
bloom
together
with
a
host
of
yellow
composite
tall
enough
now
to
bend
in
the
wind
and
show
wavering
ripples
of
shade
in
april
as
a
whole
reached
its
greatest
height
and
the
plain
over
all
its
varied
surface
was
mantled
with
a
close
furred
plush
of
purple
and
golden
corollas
by
the
end
of
this
month
most
of
the
species
had
ripened
their
seeds
but
undecayed
still
seemed
to
be
in
bloom
from
the
numerous
involucres
and
whorls
of
chaffy
scales
of
the
composite
in

the
bees
found
in

and
september
is
the
season
of
rest
and
sleep
winter
of
dry
heat
in
october
by
a
second
outburst
of
bloom
at
the
very
driest
time
of
the
year
then
after
the
shrunken
mass
of
leaves
and
stalks
of
the
dead
vegetation
crinkle
and
turn
to
dust
beneath
the
foot
as
if
it
had
been
baked
in
an
oven
a
slender
unobtrusive
little
plant
from
six
inches
to
three
feet
high
suddenly
makes
its
appearance
in
patches
miles
in
extent
like
a
resurrection
of
the
bloom
of
april
i
have
counted
upward
of
flowers
five
eighths
of
an
inch
in
diameter
on
a
single
plant
both
its
leaves
and
stems
are
so
slender
as
to
be
nearly
invisible
at
a
distance
of
a
few
yards
amid
so
showy
a
multitude
of
flowers
the
ray
and
disk
flowers
are
both
yellow
the
stamens
purple
and
the
texture
of
the
rays
is
rich
and
velvety
like
the
petals
of
garden
pansies
the
prevailing
wind
turns
all
the
heads
round
to
the
southeast
so
that
in
facing
northwestward
we
have
the
flowers
looking
us
in
the
face
in
my
estimation
this
little
plant
the
last
born
of
the
brilliant
host
of
compositae
that
glorify
the
plain
is
the
most
interesting
of
all
it
remains
in
flower
until
november
uniting
with
two
or
three
species
of
wiry
eriogonums
which
continue
the
floral
chain
around
december
to
the
spring
flowers
of
january
thus
although
the
main
bloom
and
honey
season
is
only
about
three
months
long
the
floral
circle
however
thin
around
some
of
the
hot
rainless
months
is
never
completely
broken
how
long
the
various
species
of
wild
bees
have
lived
in
this
nobody
knows
probably
ever
since
the
main
body
of
the
present
flora
gained
possession
of
the
land
toward
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
the
first
brown
brought
to
california
are
said
to
have
arrived
in
san
francisco
in
march
a
by
the
name
of
shelton
purchased
a
lot
consisting
of
twelve
swarms
from
some
one
at
aspinwall
who
had
brought
them
from
new
york
when
landed
at
san
francisco
all
the
hives
contained
live
bees
but
they
finally
dwindled
to
one
hive
which
was
taken
to
san
josé
the
little
immigrants
flourished
and
multiplied
in
the
bountiful
pastures
of
the
santa
clara
valley
sending
off
three
swarms
the
first
season
the
owner
was
killed
shortly
afterward
and
in
settling
up
his
estate
two
of
the
swarms
were
sold
at
auction
for
and
respectively
other
importations
were
made
from
time
to
time
by
way
of
the
isthmus
and
though
great
pains
were
taken
to
insure
success
about
one
half
usually
died
on
the
way
four
swarms
were
brought
safely
across
the
plains
in
the
hives
being
placed
in
the
rear
end
of
a
wagon
which
was
stopped
in
the
afternoon
to
allow
the
bees
to
fly
and
feed
in
the
floweriest
places
that
were
within
reach
until
dark
when
the
hives
were
closed
in
two
years
after
the
time
of
the
first
arrivals
from
new
york
a
single
swarm
was
brought
over
from
san
josé
and
let
fly
in
the
great
central
plain
however
has
never
gained
much
attention
here
notwithstanding
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
and
the
high
price
of
honey
during
the
early
years
a
few
hives
are
found
here
and
there
among
settlers
who
chanced
to
have
learned
something
about
the
business
before
coming
to
the
state
but
sheep
cattle
grain
and
fruit
raising
are
the
chief
industries
as
they
require
less
skill
and
care
while
the
profits
thus
far
have
been
greater
in
honey
sold
here
at
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
dollars
per
pound
twelve
years
later
the
price
had
fallen
to
twelve
and
a
half
cents
in
i
sat
down
to
dinner
with
a
band
of
ravenous
at
a
ranch
on
the
san
joaquin
where
fifteen
or
twenty
hives
were
kept
and
our
host
advised
us
not
to
spare
the
large
pan
of
honey
he
had
placed
on
the
table
as
it
was
the
cheapest
article
he
had
to
offer
in
all
my
walks
however
i
have
never
come
upon
a
regular
in
the
central
valley
like
those
so
common
and
so
skilfully
managed
in
the
southern
counties
of
the
state
the
few
pounds
of
honey
and
wax
produced
are
consumed
at
home
and
are
scarcely
taken
into
account
among
the
coarser
products
of
the
farm
the
swarms
that
escape
from
their
careless
owners
have
a
weary
perplexing
time
of
it
in
seeking
suitable
homes
most
of
them
make
their
way
to
the
of
the
mountains
or
to
the
trees
that
line
the
banks
of
the
rivers
where
some
hollow
log
or
trunk
may
be
found
a
friend
of
mine
while
out
hunting
on
the
san
joaquin
came
upon
an
old
coon
trap
hidden
among
some
tall
grass
near
the
edge
of
the
river
upon
which
he
sat
down
to
rest
shortly
afterward
his
attention
was
attracted
to
a
crowd
of
angry
bees
that
were
flying
excitedly
about
his
head
when
he
discovered
that
he
was
sitting
upon
their
hive
which
was
found
to
contain
more
than
pounds
of
honey
out
in
the
broad
swampy
delta
of
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
rivers
the
little
wanderers
have
been
known
to
build
their
combs
in
a
bunch
of
rushes
or
stiff
wiry
grass
only
slightly
protected
from
the
weather
and
in
danger
every
spring
of
being
carried
away
by
floods
they
have
the
advantage
however
of
a
vast
extent
of
fresh
pasture
accessible
only
to
themselves
the
present
condition
of
the
grand
central
garden
is
very
different
from
that
we
have
sketched
about
twenty
years
ago
when
the
gold
placers
had
been
pretty
thoroughly
exhausted
the
attention
of
in
great
part
turned
away
from
the
mines
to
the
fertile
plains
and
many
began
experiments
in
a
kind
of
restless
wild
agriculture
a
load
of
lumber
would
be
hauled
to
some
spot
on
the
free
wilderness
where
water
could
be
easily
found
and
a
rude
built
then
a
was
procured
and
a
dozen
mustang
ponies
worth
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
apiece
and
with
these
hundreds
of
acres
were
stirred
as
easily
as
if
the
land
had
been
under
cultivation
for
years
tough
perennial
roots
being
almost
wholly
absent
thus
a
ranch
was
established
and
from
these
bare
wooden
huts
as
centers
of
desolation
the
wild
flora
vanished
in
circles
but
the
arch
destroyers
are
the
shepherds
with
their
flocks
of
hoofed
locusts
sweeping
over
the
ground
like
a
fire
and
trampling
down
every
rod
that
escapes
the
plow
as
completely
as
if
the
whole
plain
were
a
cottage
without
a
fence
but
notwithstanding
these
destroyers
a
thousand
swarms
of
bees
may
be
pastured
here
for
every
one
now
gathering
honey
the
greater
portion
is
still
covered
every
season
with
a
repressed
growth
of
for
most
of
the
species
are
annuals
and
many
of
them
are
not
relished
by
sheep
or
cattle
while
the
rapidity
of
their
growth
enables
them
to
develop
and
mature
their
seeds
before
any
foot
has
time
to
crush
them
the
ground
is
therefore
kept
sweet
and
the
race
is
perpetuated
though
only
as
a
suggestive
shadow
of
the
magnificence
of
its
wildness
the
time
will
undoubtedly
come
when
the
entire
area
of
this
noble
valley
will
be
tilled
like
a
garden
when
the
fertilizing
waters
of
the
mountains
now
flowing
to
the
sea
will
be
distributed
to
every
acre
giving
rise
to
prosperous
towns
wealth
arts
etc
then
i
suppose
there
will
be
few
left
even
among
botanists
to
deplore
the
vanished
primeval
flora
in
the
mean
time
the
pure
waste
going
wanton
destruction
of
the
a
sad
sight
to
see
and
the
sun
may
well
be
pitied
in
being
compelled
to
look
on
the
of
the
coast
ranges
last
longer
and
are
more
varied
than
those
of
the
great
plain
on
account
of
differences
of
soil
and
climate
moisture
and
shade
etc
some
of
the
mountains
are
upward
of
feet
in
height
and
small
streams
springs
oozy
bogs
occur
in
great
abundance
and
variety
in
the
wooded
regions
while
open
parks
flooded
with
sunshine
and
valleys
lying
at
different
elevations
each
with
its
own
peculiar
climate
and
exposure
possess
the
required
conditions
for
the
development
of
species
and
families
of
plants
widely
varied
next
the
plain
there
is
first
a
series
of
smooth
hills
planted
with
a
rich
and
showy
vegetation
that
differs
but
little
from
that
of
the
plain
if
the
edge
of
the
plain
had
been
lifted
and
bent
into
flowing
folds
with
all
its
flowers
in
place
only
toned
down
a
little
as
to
their
luxuriance
and
a
few
new
species
introduced
such
as
the
hill
lupines
mints
and
gilias
the
colors
show
finely
when
thus
held
to
view
on
the
slopes
patches
of
red
purple
blue
yellow
and
white
blending
around
the
edges
the
whole
appearing
at
a
little
distance
like
a
map
colored
in
sections
above
this
lies
the
park
and
chaparral
region
with
oaks
mostly
evergreen
planted
wide
apart
and
blooming
shrubs
from
three
to
ten
feet
high
manzanita
and
ceanothus
of
several
species
mixed
with
rhamnus
cercis
pickeringia
cherry
amelanchier
and
adenostoma
in
shaggy
interlocking
thickets
and
many
species
of
hosackia
clover
monardella
castilleia
in
the
openings
the
main
ranges
send
out
spurs
somewhat
parallel
to
their
axes
inclosing
level
valleys
many
of
them
quite
extensive
and
containing
a
great
profusion
of
in
their
wild
state
but
these
are
in
great
part
already
lost
to
the
bees
by
cultivation
nearer
the
coast
are
the
giant
forests
of
the
redwoods
extending
from
near
the
oregon
line
to
santa
cruz
beneath
the
cool
deep
shade
of
these
majestic
trees
the
ground
is
occupied
by
ferns
chiefly
woodwardia
and
aspidiums
with
only
a
few
flowering
trientalis
erythronium
fritillaria
smilax
and
other
but
all
along
the
redwood
belt
there
are
sunny
openings
on
looking
to
the
south
where
the
giant
trees
stand
back
and
give
the
ground
to
the
small
sunflowers
and
the
bees
around
the
lofty
redwood
walls
of
these
little
there
is
usually
a
fringe
of
chestnut
oak
laurel
and
madroño
the
last
of
which
is
a
surpassingly
beautiful
tree
and
a
great
favorite
with
the
bees
the
trunks
of
the
largest
specimens
are
seven
or
eight
feet
thick
and
about
fifty
feet
high
the
bark
red
and
chocolate
colored
the
leaves
plain
large
and
glossy
like
those
of
while
the
flowers
are
and
in
panicles
from
five
to
ten
inches
long
when
in
full
bloom
a
single
tree
seems
to
be
visited
at
times
by
a
whole
hive
of
bees
at
once
and
the
deep
hum
of
such
a
multitude
makes
the
listener
guess
that
more
than
the
ordinary
work
of
must
be
going
on
how
perfectly
enchanting
and
are
these
withdrawn
gardens
of
the
vistas
opening
to
the
sifting
and
pouring
upon
the
flowery
ground
in
a
tremulous
shifting
mosaic
as
the
in
the
leafy
wall
open
and
close
with
the
swaying
leaves
and
flowers
birds
and
bees
mingling
together
in
springtime
harmony
and
soothing
fragrance
exhaling
from
a
thousand
thousand
fountains
in
these
balmy
dissolving
days
when
the
deep
of
nature
are
felt
thrilling
rocks
and
trees
and
everything
alike
common
business
and
friends
are
happily
forgotten
and
even
the
natural
of
bees
and
the
care
of
birds
for
their
young
and
mothers
for
their
children
seem
slightly
out
of
place
to
the
northward
in
humboldt
and
the
adjacent
counties
whole
hillsides
are
covered
with
rhododendron
making
a
glorious
melody
of
in
the
spring
and
the
western
azalea
hardly
less
flowery
grows
in
massy
thickets
three
to
eight
feet
high
around
the
edges
of
groves
and
woods
as
far
south
as
san
luis
obispo
usually
accompanied
by
manzanita
while
the
valleys
with
their
varying
moisture
and
shade
yield
a
rich
variety
of
the
smaller
such
as
mentha
lycopus
micromeria
audibertia
trichostema
and
other
mints
with
vaccinium
wild
strawberry
geranium
calais
and
goldenrod
and
in
the
cool
glens
along
the
where
the
shade
of
trees
is
not
too
deep
spiraea
heteromeles
and
calycanthus
and
many
species
of
rubus
form
interlacing
tangles
some
portion
of
which
continues
in
bloom
for
months
though
the
coast
region
was
the
first
to
be
invaded
and
settled
by
white
men
it
has
suffered
less
from
a
bee
point
of
view
than
either
of
the
other
main
divisions
chiefly
no
doubt
because
of
the
unevenness
of
the
surface
and
because
it
is
owned
and
protected
instead
of
lying
exposed
to
the
flocks
of
the
wandering
these
remarks
apply
more
particularly
to
the
north
half
of
the
coast
farther
south
there
is
less
moisture
less
forest
shade
and
the
honey
flora
is
less
varied
the
sierra
region
is
the
largest
of
the
three
main
divisions
of
the
of
the
state
and
the
most
regularly
varied
in
its
subdivisions
owing
to
their
gradual
rise
from
the
level
of
the
central
plain
to
the
alpine
summits
the
region
is
about
as
dry
and
sunful
from
the
end
of
may
until
the
setting
in
of
the
winter
rains
as
the
plain
there
are
no
shady
forests
no
damp
glens
at
all
like
those
lying
at
the
same
elevations
in
the
coast
mountains
the
social
compositae
of
the
plain
with
a
few
added
species
form
the
bulk
of
the
herbaceous
portion
of
the
vegetation
up
to
a
height
of
feet
or
more
shaded
lightly
here
and
there
with
oaks
and
sabine
pines
and
interrupted
by
patches
of
ceanothus
and
buckeye
above
this
and
just
below
the
forest
region
there
is
a
dark
belt
of
chaparral
composed
almost
exclusively
of
a
bush
belonging
to
the
rose
family
from
five
to
eight
feet
high
with
small
round
leaves
in
fascicles
and
bearing
a
multitude
of
small
white
flowers
in
panicles
on
the
ends
of
the
upper
branches
where
it
occurs
at
all
it
usually
covers
all
the
ground
with
a
close
impenetrable
growth
scarcely
broken
for
miles
up
through
the
forest
region
to
a
height
of
about
feet
above
there
are
ragged
patches
of
manzanita
and
five
or
six
species
of
ceanothus
called
or
california
lilac
these
are
the
most
important
of
all
the
bushes
of
the
sierra
a
little
shrub
about
a
foot
high
with
flowers
like
the
strawberry
makes
handsome
carpets
beneath
the
pines
and
seems
to
be
a
favorite
with
the
bees
while
pines
themselves
furnish
unlimited
quantities
of
pollen
and
the
product
of
a
single
tree
ripening
its
pollen
at
the
right
time
of
year
would
be
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
a
whole
hive
along
the
streams
there
is
a
rich
growth
of
lilies
larkspurs
pedicularis
castilleias
and
clover
the
alpine
region
contains
the
flowery
glacier
meadows
and
countless
small
gardens
in
all
sorts
of
places
full
of
potentilla
of
several
species
spraguea
ivesia
epilobium
and
goldenrod
with
beds
of
bryanthus
and
the
charming
cassiope
covered
with
sweet
bells
even
the
tops
of
the
mountains
are

etc
i
have
seen
wild
bees
and
butterflies
feeding
at
a
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
many
however
that
go
up
these
dangerous
heights
never
come
down
again
some
undoubtedly
perish
in
storms
and
i
have
found
thousands
lying
dead
or
benumbed
on
the
surface
of
the
glaciers
to
which
they
had
perhaps
been
attracted
by
the
white
glare
taking
them
for
beds
of
bloom
from
swarms
that
escaped
their
owners
in
the
lowlands
the
is
now
generally
distributed
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
sierra
up
to
an
elevation
of
feet
above
at
this
height
they
flourish
without
care
though
the
snow
every
winter
is
deep
even
higher
than
this
several
have
been
cut
which
contained
over
pounds
of
honey
the
destructive
action
of
sheep
has
not
been
so
general
on
the
mountain
pastures
as
on
those
of
the
great
plain
but
in
many
places
it
has
been
more
complete
owing
to
the
more
friable
character
of
the
soil
and
its
sloping
position
the
slant
digging
and
action
of
hoofs
on
the
steeper
slopes
of
moraines
has
uprooted
and
buried
many
of
the
tender
plants
from
year
to
year
without
allowing
them
time
to
mature
their
seeds
the
shrubs
too
are
badly
bitten
especially
the
various
species
of
ceanothus
fortunately
neither
sheep
nor
cattle
care
to
feed
on
the
manzanita
spiraea
or
adenostoma
and
these
fine
are
too
stiff
and
tall
or
grow
in
places
too
rough
and
inaccessible
to
be
trodden
under
foot
also
the
cañon
walls
and
gorges
which
form
so
considerable
a
part
of
the
area
of
the
range
while
inaccessible
to
domestic
sheep
are
well
fringed
with
and
contain
thousands
of
lovely
lying
hid
in
narrow
and
recesses
fenced
with
avalanche
taluses
and
on
the
top
of
flat
projecting
headlands
where
only
bees
would
think
to
look
for
them
but
on
the
other
hand
a
great
portion
of
the
woody
plants
that
escape
the
feet
and
teeth
of
the
sheep
are
destroyed
by
the
shepherds
by
means
of
running
fires
which
are
set
everywhere
during
the
dry
autumn
for
the
purpose
of
burning
off
the
old
fallen
trunks
and
underbrush
with
a
view
to
improving
the
pastures
and
making
more
open
ways
for
the

these
destructive
sweep
through
nearly
the
entire
forest
belt
of
the
range
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
consuming
not
only
the
underbrush
but
the
young
trees
and
seedlings
on
which
the
permanence
of
the
forests
depends
thus
setting
in
motion
a
long
train
of

which
will

point
of

encircled
by

and
sweeping
aloft
from

torrid

into
the
frosty
azure
we
find
the
first
feet
from
the
summit
generally
and
therefore
about
as
honeyless
as
the
sea
the
base
of
this
arctic
region
is
girdled
by
a
belt
of
crumbling
lava
measuring
about
feet
in
vertical
breadth
and
is
mostly
free
from
snow
in
summer
beautiful
lichens
enliven
the
faces
of
the
cliffs
with
their
bright
colors
and
in
some
of
the
warmer
nooks
there
are
a
few
tufts
of
alpine
daisies
and
pentstemons
but
notwithstanding
these
bloom
freely
in
the
late
summer
the
zone
as
a
whole
is
almost
as
honeyless
as
the
icy
summit
and
its
lower
edge
may
be
taken
as
the
immediately
below
this
comes
the
forest
zone
covered
with
a
rich
growth
of
conifers
chiefly
silver
firs
rich
in
pollen
and
and
diversified
with
countless
garden
openings
many
of
them
less
than
a
hundred
yards
across
next
in
orderly
succession
comes
the
great

its
area
far
surpasses

of
the

both
the
other

combined
for
it

sweeping

around
the
entire

a
breadth
of
six
or
seven
miles
and
a
circumference
of
nearly
a
hundred
miles
shasta
as
we
have
already
seen
is
a
created
by
a
succession
of
eruptions
of
ashes
and
molten
lava
which
flowing
over
the
lips
of
its
several
craters
grew
outward
and
upward
like
the
trunk
of
a
knotty
exogenous
tree
then
followed
a
strange
contrast
the
glacial
winter
came
on
loading
the
cooling
mountain
with
ice
which
flowed
slowly
outward
in
every
direction
radiating
from
the
summit
in
the
form
of
one
vast
conical
mantle
of
ice
upon
a
fountain
of
smoldering
fire
crushing
and
grinding
for
centuries
its
brown
flinty
lavas
with
incessant
activity
and
thus
degrading
and
remodeling
the
entire
mountain
when
at
length
the
glacial
period
began
to
draw
near
its
close
the
was
gradually
melted
off
around
the
bottom
and
in
receding
and
breaking
into
its
present
fragmentary
condition
irregular
rings
and
heaps
of
moraine
matter
were
stored
upon
its
flanks
the
glacial
erosion
of
most
of
the
shasta
lavas
produces
detritus
composed
of
rough
boulders
of
moderate
size
and
of
porous
gravel
and
sand
which
yields
freely
to
the
transporting
power
of
running
water
magnificent
floods
from
the
ample
fountains
of
ice
and
snow
working
with
sublime
energy
upon
this
prepared
glacial
detritus
sorted
it
out
and
carried
down
immense
quantities
from
the
higher
slopes
and
reformed
it
in
smooth
beds
around
the
base
and
it
is
these
joined
together
that
now
form
the
main
of
the
old
volcano
thus
by
forces
seemingly
antagonistic
and
destructive
has
mother
nature
accomplished
her
beneficent
a
flood
of
fire
now
a
flood
of
ice
now
a
flood
of
water
and
at
length
an
outburst
of
organic
life
a
milky
way
of
snowy
petals
and
wings
girdling
the
rugged
mountain
like
a
cloud
as
if
the
vivifying
sunbeams
beating
against
its
sides
had
broken
into
a
foam
of
and
bees
as
break
and
bloom
on
a
rock
shore
in
this
flowery
wilderness
the
bees
rove
and
revel
rejoicing
in
the
bounty
of
the
sun
clambering
eagerly
through
bramble
and
hucklebloom
ringing
the
myriad
bells
of
the
manzanita
now
humming
aloft
among
polleny
willows
and
firs
now
down
on
the
ashy
ground
among
gilias
and
buttercups
and
anon
plunging
deep
into
snowy
banks
of
cherry
and
buckthorn
they
consider
the
lilies
and
roll
into
them
and
like
lilies
they
toil
not
for
they
are
impelled
by
as
by
and
when
the
one
has
plenty
of
water
the
other
plenty
of
sunshine
they
hum
and
quiver
alike
sauntering
in
the
shasta
in
the
of
summer
one
may
readily
infer
the
time
of
day
from
the
comparative
energy
of
and
moderate
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
increasing
in
energy
with
the
ascending
sun
and
at
high
noon
thrilling
and
quivering
in
wild
ecstasy
then
gradually
declining
again
to
the
stillness
of
night
in
my
excursions
among
the
glaciers
i
occasionally
meet
bees
that
are
hungry
like
mountaineers
who
venture
too
far
and
remain
too
long
above
the
then
they
droop
and
wither
like
autumn
leaves
the
shasta
bees
are
perhaps
better
fed
than
any
others
in
the
sierra
their
is
one
perpetual
feast
but
however
exhilarating
the
sunshine
or
bountiful
the
supply
of
flowers
they
are
always
dainty
feeders
and
hummingbirds
seldom
set
foot
upon
a
flower
but
poise
on
the
wing
in
front
of
it
and
reach
forward
as
if
they
were
sucking
through
straws
but
bees
though
as
dainty
as
they
hug
their
favorite
flowers
with
profound
cordiality
and
push
their
blunt
polleny
faces
against
them
like
babies
on
their
bosom
and
fondly
too
with
eternal
love
does
mother
nature
clasp
her
small
and
suckle
them
multitudes
at
once
on
her
warm
shasta
breast
besides
the
common
there
are
many
other
species
mossy
burly
fellows
who
were
nourished
on
the
mountains
thousands
of
sunny
seasons
before
the
advent
of
the
domestic
species
among
these
are
the
bumblebees
and
butterflies
too
and
moths
of
every
size
and
pattern
some
like
bats
flapping
slowly
and
sailing
in
easy
curves
others
like
small
flying
violets
shaking
about
loosely
in
short
crooked
flights
close
to
the
flowers
feasting
luxuriously
night
and
day
great
numbers
of
deer
also
delight
to
dwell
in
the
brushy
portions
of
the
bears
too
roam
the
sweet
wilderness
their
blunt
shaggy
forms
harmonizing
well
with
the
trees
and
tangled
bushes
and
with
the
bees
also
notwithstanding
the
disparity
in
size
they
are
fond
of
all
good
things
and
enjoy
them
to
the
utmost
with
but
little
troublesome
and
leaves
as
well
as
berries
and
the
bees
themselves
as
well
as
their
honey
though
the
california
bears
have
as
yet
had
but
little
experience
with
honeybees
they
often
succeed
in
reaching
their
bountiful
stores
and
it
seems
doubtful
whether
bees
themselves
enjoy
honey
with
so
great
a
relish
by
means
of
their
powerful
teeth
and
claws
they
can
gnaw
and
tear
open
almost
any
hive
conveniently
accessible
most
however
in
search
of
a
home
are
wise
enough
to
make
choice
of
a
hollow
in
a
living
tree
a
considerable
distance
above
the
ground
when
such
places
are
to
be
had
then
they
are
pretty
secure
for
though
the
smaller
black
and
brown
bears
climb
well
they
are
unable
to
break
into
strong
hives
while
compelled
to
exert
themselves
to
keep
from
falling
and
at
the
same
time
to
endure
the
stings
of
the
fighting
bees
without
having
their
paws
free
to
rub
them
off
but
woe
to
the
black
bumblebees
discovered
in
their
mossy
nests
in
the
ground
with
a
few
strokes
of
their
huge
paws
the
bears
uncover
the
entire
establishment
and
before

is
given
for
a
general
buzz

young

all
are
taken
in

magical

according
to
gordon
president
of
the
los
angeles
county
association
the
first
bees
introduced
into
the
county
were
a
single
hive
which
cost
in
san
francisco
and
arrived
in
september
in
april
of
the
following
year
this
hive
sent
out
two
swarms
which
were
sold
for
each
from
this
small
beginning
the
bees
gradually
multiplied
to
about
swarms
in
the
year
in
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
between
and
hives
in
the
county
producing
an
annual
yield
of
about
pounds
to
the
some
exceptional
cases
a
much
greater
yield
in
san
diego
county
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
of
there
were
about
hives
and
the
shipments
from
the
one
port
of
san
diego

may
be
formed
from
an
excursion
that
i
made
into
the
san
gabriel
range
about
the
beginning
of
august
of
dry
this
range
containing
most
of
the
characteristic
features
of
the
other
ranges
just
mentioned
overlooks
the
los
angeles
vineyards
and
orange
groves
from
the
north
and
is
more
rigidly
inaccessible
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
than
any
other
that
i
ever
attempted
to
penetrate
the
slopes
are
exceptionally
steep
and
insecure
to
the
foot
and
they
are
covered
with
thorny
bushes
from
five
to
ten
feet
high
with
the
exception
of
little
spots
not
visible
in
general
views
the
entire
surface
is
covered
with
them
massed
in
close
hedge
growth
sweeping
gracefully
down
into
every
gorge
and
hollow
and
swelling
over
every
ridge
and
summit
in
shaggy
ungovernable
exuberance
offering
more
honey
to
the
acre
for
half
the
year
than
the
most
crowded
but
when
beheld
from
the
open
san
gabriel
valley
beaten
with
dry
sunshine
all
that
was
seen
of
the
range
seemed
to
wear
a
forbidding
aspect
from
base
to
summit
all
seemed
gray
barren
silent
its
glorious
chaparral
appearing
like
dry
moss
creeping
over
its
dull
wrinkled
ridges
and
hollows
setting
out
from
pasadena
i
reached
the
foot
of
the
range
about
sundown
and
being
weary
and
heated
with
my
walk
across
the
shadeless
valley
concluded
to
camp
for
the
night
after
resting
a
few
moments
i
began
to
look
about
among
the
of
eaton
creek
for
a
when
i
came
upon
a
strange
man
who
had
been
chopping
he
seemed
surprised
at
seeing
me
so
i
sat
down
with
him
on
the
log
he
had
been
cutting
and
made
haste
to
give
a
reason
for
my
appearance
in
his
solitude
explaining
that
i
was
anxious
to
find
out
something
about
the
mountains
and
meant
to
make
my
way
up
eaton
creek
next
morning
then
he
kindly
invited
me
to
camp
with
him
and
led
me
to
his
little
cabin
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
where
a
small
spring
oozes
out
of
a
bank
overgrown
with
bushes
after
supper
when
the
daylight
was
gone
he
explained
that
he
was
out
of
candles
so
we
sat
in
the
dark
while
he
gave
me
a
sketch
of
his
life
in
a
mixture
of
spanish
and
english
he
was
born
in
mexico
his
father
irish
his
mother
spanish
he
had
been
a
miner
rancher
prospector
hunter
rambling
always
and
wearing
his
life
away
in
mere
waste
but
now
he
was
going
to
settle
down
his
past
life
he
said
was
of
account
but
the
future
was
promising
he
was
going
to
money
and
marry
a
spanish
people
mine
here
for
water
as
for
gold
he
had
been
running
a
tunnel
into
a
spur
of
the
mountain
back
of
his
cabin
prospect
is
good
he
said
if
i
chance
to
strike
a
good
strong
flow
soon
be
worth
or
for
that
flat
out
there
referring
to
a
small
irregular
patch
of
bouldery
detritus
two
or
three
acres
in
size
that
had
been
deposited
by
eaton
creek
during
some
flood
season
flat
is
large
enough
for
a
nice
and
the
bank
behind
the
cabin
will
do
for
a
vineyard
and
after
watering
my
own
trees
and
vines
i
will
have
some
water
left
to
sell
to
my
neighbors
below
me
down
the
valley
and
then
he
continued
can
keep
bees
and
make
money
that
way
too
for
the
mountains
above
here
are
just
full
of
honey
in
the
and
one
of
my
neighbors
down
here
says
that
he
will
let
me
have
a
whole
lot
of
hives
on
shares
to
start
with
you
see
a
good
thing
all
right
all
this
prospective
affluence
in
the
sunken
of
a
leaving
the
bees
out
of
the
count
most
would
as
soon
think
of
settling
on
the
summit
of
mount
shasta
next
morning
wishing
my
hopeful
entertainer
good
luck
i
set
out
on
my
shaggy
excursion
illustration
a
on
the
moraine
desert
spanish
bayonet
about
half
an
walk
above
the
cabin
i
came
to
fall
famous
throughout
the
valley
settlements
as
the
finest
yet
discovered
in
the
san
gabriel
mountains
it
is
a
charming
little
thing
with
a
low
sweet
voice
singing
like
a
bird
as
it
pours
from
a
notch
in
a
short
ledge
some
or
forty
feet
into
a
round
the
face
of
the
cliff
back
of
it
and
on
both
sides
is
smoothly
covered
and
embossed
with
mosses
against
which
the
white
water
shines
out
in
showy
relief
like
a
silver
instrument
in
a
velvet
case
hither
come
the
san
gabriel
lads
and
lassies
to
gather
ferns
and
dabble
away
their
hot
holidays
in
the
cool
water
glad
to
escape
from
their
commonplace
and
the
delicate
maidenhair
grows
on
fissured
rocks
within
reach
of
the
spray
while
maples
and
sycamores
cast
soft
mellow
shade
over
a
rich
profusion
of
growing
among
boulders
in
front
of
the
fall
the
flowers
the
bees
the
ferny
rocks
and
leafy
shade
forming
a
charming
little
poem
of
wildness
the
last
of
a
series
extending
down
the
flowery
slopes
of
mount
san
antonio
through
the
rugged
bosses
of
the
main
eaton
canon
from
the
base
of
the
fall
i
followed
the
ridge
that
forms
the
western
rim
of
the
eaton
basin
to
the
summit
of
one
of
the
principal
peaks
which
is
about
feet
above
then
turning
eastward
i
crossed
the
middle
of
the
basin
forcing
a
way
over
its
many
subordinate
ridges
and
across
its
eastern
rim
having
to
contend
almost
everywhere
with
the
floweriest
and
most
impenetrable
growth
of
i
had
ever
encountered
since
first
my
mountaineering
began
most
of
the
shasta
chaparral
is
leafy
nearly
to
the
ground
here
the
main
stems
are
naked
for
three
or
four
feet
and
interspiked
with
dead
twigs
forming
a
stiff
de
through
which
even
the
bears
make
their
way
with
difficulty
i
was
compelled
to
creep
for
miles
on
all
fours
and
in
following
the
often
found
tufts
of
hair
on
the
bushes
where
they
had
forced
themselves
through
for
feet
or
so
above
the
fall
the
ascent
was
made
possible
only
by
tough
cushions
of
that
clung
to
the
rock
above
this
the
ridge
weathers
away
to
a
thin
for
a
few
hundred
yards
and
thence
to
the
summit
of
the
range
it
carries
a
bristly
mane
of
chaparral
here
and
there
small
openings
occur
on
rocky
places
commanding
fine
views
across
the
cultivated
valley
to
the
ocean
these
i
found
by
the
tracks
were
favorite
outlooks
and
for
the
wild
wolves
foxes
wildcats
abound
here
and
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
establishment
of
in
the
deepest
thickets
i
found
of
huts
four
to
six
feet
high
built
of
sticks
and
leaves
in
rough
tapering
piles
like
cabins
i
noticed
a
good
many
bees
too
most
of
them
wild
the
tame
seemed
languid
and
as
if
they
had
come
all
the
way
up
from
the
flowerless
valley
after
reaching
the
summit
i
had
time
to
make
only
a
hasty
survey
of
the
basin
now
glowing
in
the
sunset
gold
before
hastening
down
into
one
of
the
tributary
cañons
in
search
of
water
emerging
from
a
particularly
tedious
breadth
of
chaparral
i
found
myself
free
and
erect
in
a
beautiful
grove
of
mountain
live
oak
where
the
ground
was
planted
with
aspidiums
and
while
the
glossy
foliage
made
a
close
canopy
overhead
leaving
the
gray
dividing
trunks
bare
to
show
the
beauty
of
their
interlacing
arches
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
was
dry
where
i
first
reached
it
but
a
bunch
of
scarlet
mimulus
indicated
water
at
no
great
distance
and
i
soon
discovered
about
a
bucketful
in
a
hollow
of
the
rock
this
however
was
full
of
dead
bees
wasps
beetles
and
leaves
well
steeped
and
simmered
and
would
therefore
require
boiling
and
filtering
through
fresh
charcoal
before
it
could
be
made
available
tracing
the
dry
channel
about
a
mile
farther
down
to
its
junction
with
a
larger
tributary
cañon
i
at
length
discovered
a
lot
of
boulder
pools
clear
as
crystal
brimming
full
and
linked
together
by
glistening
streamlets
just
strong
enough
to
sing
audibly
flowers
in
full
bloom
adorned
their
margins
lilies
ten
feet
high
larkspur
columbines
and
luxuriant
ferns
leaning
and
overarching
in
lavish
abundance
while
a
noble
old
live
oak
spread
its
rugged
arms
over
all
here
i
camped
making
my
bed
on
smooth
cobblestones
illustration
a
above
below
next
day
in
the
channel
of
a
tributary
that
heads
on
mount
san
antonio
i
passed
about
fifteen
or
twenty
gardens
like
the
one
in
which
i
in
every
one
of
them
in
the
full
pomp
of
bloom
my
third
camp
was
made
near
the
middle
of
the
general
basin
at
the
head
of
a
long
system
of
cascades
from
ten
to
feet
high
one
following
the
other
in
close
succession
down
a
rocky
inaccessible
cañon
making
a
total
descent
of
nearly
feet
above
the
cascades
the
main
stream
passes
through
a
series
of
open
sunny
levels
the
largest
of
which
are
about
an
acre
in
size
where
the
wild
bees
and
their
companions
were
feasting
on
a
showy
growth
of
zauschneria
painted
cups
and
monardella
and
gray
squirrels
were
busy
harvesting
the
burs
of
the
douglas
spruce
the
only
conifer
i
met
in
the
basin
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
basin
are
in
every
way
similar
to
those
we
have
described
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
portions
of
the
range
from
the
highest
summit
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
landscape
was
one
vast
a
rolling
wilderness
of
scarcely
broken
by
bits
of
forest
or
the
rocky
outcrops
of
hilltops
and
ridges
behind
the
san
bernardino
range
lies
the
wild
country
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
colorado
river
and
extending
in
a
general
northerly
direction
to
nevada
and
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
sierra
beyond
mono
lake
the
greater
portion
of
this
immense
region
including
valley
death
valley
and
the
sink
of
the
mohave
the
area
of
which
is
nearly
one
fifth
that
of
the
entire
state
is
usually
regarded
as
a
desert
not
because
of
any
lack
in
the
soil
but
for
want
of
rain
and
rivers
available
for
irrigation
very
little
of
it
however
is
desert
in
the
eyes
of
a
bee
looking
now
over
all
the
available
pastures
of
california
it
appears
that
the
business
of
beekeeping
is
still
in
its
infancy
even
in
the
more
enterprising
of
the
southern
counties
where
so
vigorous
a
beginning
has
been
made
less
than
a
tenth
of
their
honey
resources
have
as
yet
been
developed
while
in
the
great
plain
the
coast
ranges
the
sierra
nevada
and
the
northern
region
about
mount
shasta
the
business
can
hardly
be
said
to
exist
at
all
what
the
limits
of
its
developments
in
the
future
may
be
with
the
advantages
of
cheaper
transportation
and
the
invention
of
better
methods
in
general
it
is
not
easy
to
guess
nor
on
the
other
hand
are
we
able
to
measure
the
influence
on
bee

likely
to
follow
the
destruction
of
the
forests
now
rapidly
falling
before
fire
and
the
ax
as

evil
that
can
hardly
become
greater
than
it
is
at
the
present

in

the
deterioration
and
destruction
of

kind
already
effected
california
with
her
incomparable
climate

still
as
far
as
i
