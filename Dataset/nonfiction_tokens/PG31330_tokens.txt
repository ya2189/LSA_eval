sphinx
riddle
say
you
which
yet
awaits
its

perhaps
though
an
examination
of
the
past
may
show
us
that
the
riddle
is
not
awaiting
its
oedipus
so
much
as
his
answer
which
he
has
been
writing
slowly
word
by
word
and
inexorably
in
the
social
evolution
of
the
republic
for
a
century
and
is
writing
still
if
we
succeed
in
reading
aright
what
has
already
been
inscribed
by
that
iron
pen
may
we
not
guess
the
remainder
and
so
catch
from
afar
the
fateful
answer
possibly
then
let
us
try
with
unequaled
sagacity
the
founders
of
the
american
republic
reared
without
prototype
or
precedent
its
solid
walls
and
stately
columns
on
the
broad
basis
of
human
equality
and
of
certain
inalienable
rights
such
as
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
to
which
they
declared
all
men
entitled
deep
they
sunk
their
foundation
piles
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
committed
fearlessly
sublimely
the
new
state
to
the
people
but
there
was
an
exception
and
on
this
exception
hangs
our
tale
and
turns
the
dark
drama
of
our
national
history
those
founders
had
to
deal
with
many
novel
and
perplexing
problems
of
construction
but
none
seemed
so
difficult
to
handle
as
were
those
which
grew
out
of
the
presence
of
african
slavery
as
an
industrial
system
in
several
of
the
states
at
the
threshold
of
national
existence
these
men
were
constrained
by
circumstances
to
make
an
exception
to
the
primary
principles
which
they
had
placed
at
the
bottom
of
their
untried
and
bold
experiment
in
popular
government
this
sacrifice
of
fundamental
truth
carried
along
with
it
one
of
the
sternest
retributions
of
history
for
it
involved
the
admission
on
equal
footing
into
the
union
of
a
fundamental
error
in
ethics
and
economics
with
which
our
new
industrial
democracy
was
forced
presently
to
engage
in
deadly
strife
for
existence
and
survivorship
the
american
fathers
were
undoubtedly
aware
of
the
misfortune
of
admitting
under
one
general
government
and
on
terms
of
equality
two
mutually
invasive
and
destructive
social
ideas
and
their
corresponding
systems
of
labor
but
they
were
baffled
at
the
time
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
political
necessity
and
so
met
the
grand
emergency
of
the
age
by
concession
and
a
spirit
of
conciliation
many
of
them
indeed
desired
on
economic
as
well
as
on
moral
grounds
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
probably
felt
the
more
disposed
to
compromise
with
the
evil
in
the
general
confidence
with
which
they
regarded
its
early
and
ultimate
extinction
this
humane
expectation
of
the
young
republic
failed
of
realization
owing
primarily
and
chiefly
i
think
to
the
potent
influence
upon
the
institution
of
slavery
of
certain
inventions
and
their
industrial
application
in
england
and
america
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
these
inventions
were
the
spinning
jenny
of
hargreaves
the
spinning
machine
of
arkwright
and
the
mule
of
crompton
in
combination
with
the
steam
engine
which
turned
says
john
richard
green
lancastershire
into
a
hive
of
industry
and
last
though
not
least
in
its
direct
and
indirect
effects
on
slavery
was
the
cotton
gin
of
eli
whitney
which
formed
the
other
half
the
other
hand
so
to
speak
of
the
spinning
frame
the
new
power
loom
in
england
created
a
growing
demand
for
raw
cotton
which
the
american
contrivance
enabled
the
southern
planter
to
meet
with
an
increased
supply
of
the
same
together
these
inventions
operated
naturally
to
enhance
the
value
of
slave
labor
and
slave
land
and
therein
conduced
powerfully
to
the
slave
revival
in
the
united
states
which
followed
their
introduction
into
the
economic
world
the
slave
industrial
system
no
longer
then
a
declining
factor
in
the
life
of
the
young
nation
assumed
instead
unexpected
importance
in
it
and
started
promptly
upon
a
course
of
extraordinary
expansion
and
prosperity
two
other
circumstances
combined
with
the
one
just
mentioned
to
produce
this
unexpected
and
deplorable
result
they
were
the
slave
compromises
of
the
constitution
and
the
early
territorial
expansion
of
the
republic
southward
these
compromises
gathered
the
reviving
slave
system
as
it
were
under
the
wings
of
the
general
government
and
so
tempered
the
adverse
forces
with
which
it
had
to
struggle
for
existence
within
the
union
to
its
tender
condition
they
embraced
the
right
to
import
negroes
into
the
united
states
as
slaves
until
the
year
which
operated
to
satisfy
in
part
the
rising
demand
of
the
south
for
slave
labor
also
the
right
to
recover
fugitive
slaves
in
any
part
of
the
country
which
added
immensely
to
the
security
of
this
species
of
property
and
the
right
of
the
states
under
the
rule
of
representation
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
to
count
five
slaves
as
three
freemen
which
rule
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
equality
of
state
representation
in
the
upper
branch
of
that
body
gave
to
that
section
an
immediate
and
controlling
influence
upon
federal
policy
and
legislation
the
territorial
expansion
of
the
republic
southward
coincided
curiously
in
point
of
time
with
the
territorial
needs
of
the
slave
system
incident
to
its
industrial
revival
increased
demand
for
the
products
of
slave
labor
in
the
market
of
the
world
had
by
the
action
of
natural
causes
raised
the
demand
for
that
labor
in
the
south
this
increased
demand
was
satisfied
to
a
limited
extent
by
the
constitutional
provision
relative
to
the
importation
of
that
labor
into
the
united
states
prior
to
the
year
and
to
an
unlimited
extent
by
the
peculiar
southern
industry
of
slave
breeding
and
the
domestic
slave
trade
which
owing
to
favorable
economic
conditions
became
presently
great
and
thriving
enterprises
for
the
production
of
wealth
the
crop
of
slaves
grew
in
time
to
be
as
valuable
as
the
crop
of
cotton
and
the
slave
section
waxed
in
consequence
rich
and
prosperous
apace
but
as
our
expanding
slave
system
was
essentially
agricultural
it
required
large
and
expanding
areas
within
which
to
operate
efficiently
wherefore
there
arose
early
in
the
section
an
industrial
demand
for
more
slave
soil
there
was
a
political
reason
also
which
intensified
this
demand
for
more
slave
soil
but
as
it
was
merely
incidental
to
the
economic
cause
i
will
leave
it
undiscussed
for
the
present
this
economic
demand
of
the
expanding
slave
system
for
more
land
was
met
by
the
opportune
cession
to
the
united
states
by
georgia
and
north
carolina
of
the
southwest
region
out
of
which
the
states
of
alabama
mississippi
and
tennessee
were
subsequently
carved
and
by
the
acquisition
of
the
louisiana
and
the
florida
territories
so
much
for
the
causes
conditions
and
circumstances
in
the
early
history
of
the
republic
which
combined
to
revive
slavery
and
to
make
it
an
immensely
important
factor
in
american
industrial
life
and
consequently
an
immensely
important
factor
in
american
political
life
as
well
just
a
word
in
passing
regarding
the
character
of
southern
labor
it
was
as
you
all
know
mainly
agricultural
its
enforced
ignorance
and
its
legally
and
morally
degraded
condition
incapacitated
the
states
from
diversifying
their
single
industry
and
limited
them
to
the
tillage
of
the
earth
this
feature
was
economically
the
fatal
defect
of
the
slave
industrial
system
in
its
rivalry
with
the
free
industrial
system
of
the
north
there
were
of
course
other
forms
of
labor
employed
in
the
south
such
as
the
class
while
many
of
the
negroes
on
plantations
and
in
southern
cities
worked
as
carpenters
bricklayers
blacksmiths
millwrights
wheelwrights
barbers
tailors
stevedores
etc
but
as
labor
classes
they
were
relatively
of
slight
importance
in
point
of
numbers
and
as
wealth
producers
in
comparison
to
the
field
hand
unlike
the
indian
under
similar
circumstances
the
negro
did
not
succumb
to
the
terrible
toil
and
inhumanity
of
his
environment
he
did
not
decline
numerically
nor
show
any
tendency
to
do
so
but
exhibited
instead
extraordinary
vitality
and
reproductive
vigor
in
physical
quality
and
equipment
he
was
as
a
laborer
ideally
adapted
to
the
south
and
accordingly
augmented
enormously
in
social
and
commercial
value
to
that
section
and
in
numbers
at
the
same
time
he
possessed
besides
certain
other
traits
which
fitted
him
peculiarly
to
his
hard
lot
and
task
he
was
of
laborers
the
most
patient
the
most
submissive
the
most
faithful
the
most
cheerful
he
was
capable
of
the
strongest
affection
and
of
making
the
greatest
sacrifices
for
those
to
whom
he
belonged
in
his
simple
and
untutored
heart
there
was
no
desire
for
vengeance
and
in
his
brave
black
hands
he
bore
nothing
but
gifts
to
the
south
gifts
of
golden
leisure
untold
wealth
baronial
pleasure
and
splendor
infinite
service
and
withal
a
phenomenal
effacement
of
himself
economically
weak
yet
singularly
favored
by
a
fortuitous
combination
of
circumstances
slave
labor
flourished
and
expanded
until
at
length
it
came
into
rough
contact
and
rivalry
with
modern
industrialism
as
it
leaped
into
life
under
the
magical
influence
of
free
institutions
in
the
half
of
the
union
it
might
be
said
that
modern
industrialism
in
america
had
its
rise
in
certain
causes
and
circumstances
which
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
it
is
well
known
how
at
that
time
almost
the
entire
commerce
of
the
civilized
world
outside
of
great
britain
and
her
colonial
possessions
was
carried
on
under
the
american
flag
in
american
bottoms
and
also
how
among
british
orders
in
council
napoleon
berlin
and
milan
decrees
and
our
own
embargo
and
acts
retaliatory
measures
adopted
by
our
government
this
splendid
commerce
was
speedily
and
effectually
destroyed
and
how
finally
this
catastrophe
produced
in
turn
our
first
industrial
crisis
under
the
constitution
new
england
found
herself
in
consequence
in
great
and
widespread
public
distress
and
her
large
capital
erstwhile
engaged
in
commercial
ventures
at
vast
profit
became
suddenly
idle
and
but
it
is
an
ill
wind
which
blows
no
good
so
it
was
in
the
case
of
new
england
at
this
period
for
the
ill
wind
which
carried
ruin
to
her
commerce
and
want
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
carried
also
the
seeds
and
small
beginnings
of
all
her
subsequent
manufacturing
greatness
and
prosperity
with
the
development
of
manufactures
which
now
followed
and
the
diversifying
of
american
industries
in
the
northern
section
of
the
union
modern
industrialism
as
a
tremendously
aggressive
social
factor
and
system
of
free
labor
was
thereupon
launched
upon
its
long
and
stormy
rivalry
and
struggle
with
slave
institutions
and
slave
labor
for
the
possession
of
the
republic
and
as
a
resultant
of
this
conflict
it
began
to
affect
also
the
history
and
destiny
of
the
negroes
of
the
united
states
new
england
naturally
enough
was
not
at
all
well
disposed
toward
a
government
whose
acts
had
inflicted
upon
her
such
bitter
distress
such
ruinous
dislocations
of
her
capital
and
labor
this
angry
discontent
was
much
aggravated
later
by
the
war
of
into
which
in
the
opinion
of
that
section
the
country
was
precipitated
by
reason
of
southern
domination
in
national
affairs
and
thus
was
perhaps
awakened
in
the
north
for
the
first
time
a
distinct
consciousness
of
the
existence
in
the
peculiar
labor
and
institutions
of
the
south
of
interests
and
forces
actively
opposed
to
those
of
free
labor
and
free
institutions
with
the
close
of
this
war
and
the
conclusion
of
peace
the
section
took
on
fresh
industrial
life
and
embarked
then
upon
that
career
of
material
exploitation
and
development
which
has
placed
it
and
the
wonderful
achievements
of
its
diversified
industries
in
the
front
rank
of
rivals
in
the
markets
of
the
world
from
this
period
dates
the
beginning
of
our
national
policy
of
protection
of
domestic
industries
and
the
rise
of
a
powerful
monied
class
in
politics
which
bore
to
the
new
industrial
interests
similar
relations
to
those
sustained
by
the
slave
power
to
southern
labor
and
institutions
the
early
policy
of
a
tariff
for
revenue
with
incidental
encouragement
inaugurated
by
hamilton
was
now
readapted
to
the
growing
needs
of
the
new
industrialism
and
the
growing
demands
of
its
champions
the
principle
of
protection
was
made
as
elastic
in
its
practical
application
to
tariff
legislation
as
northern
industrial
interests
would
from
time
to
time
and
in
their
stages
of
rapid
progress
seem
to
require
the
labor
employed
by
the
new
industrialism
was
free
white
labor
each
unit
of
which
as
wage
earner
and
citizen
was
vitally
concerned
in
whatever
made
for
its
safety
and
prosperity
the
universal
prevalence
of
the
principle
of
popular
education
and
the
remarkable
educational
function
exercised
upon
the
mental
and
moral
faculties
of
the
people
by
a
right
to
a
voice
in
the
government
gave
to
this
section
in
due
time
the
most
intelligent
energetic
and
productive
labor
in
the
world
indeed
it
is
now
well
understood
that
modern
industrialism
attains
its
highest
efficiency
as
a
system
of
production
in
that
society
where
popular
education
is
best
provided
for
and
where
participation
of
the
masses
in
the
business
of
government
reaches
its
fullest
and
freest
expression
the
freer
and
the
more
intelligent
a
people
all
things
else
being
equal
the
more
productive
will
be
their
labor
over
that
of
a
rival
who
may
be
wanting
in
these
regards
the
early
and
unexpected
revival
and
expansion
of
slavery
in
the
south
was
thus
followed
and
met
by
a
rapid
counterexpansion
of
free
industrialism
at
the
north
on
an
extraordinary
scale
this
conflictive
situation
evolved
presently
industrial
complications
and
disturbances
of
the
gravest
national
importance
following
the
treaty
of
ghent
the
south
fell
into
financial
difficulties
and
experienced
quite
generally
an
increasing
pressure
of
hard
times
although
wealthy
and
prosperous
heretofore
it
then
began
to
exhibit
symptoms
of
industrial
weakness
and
to
assume
more
and
more
a
dependent
attitude
toward
the
monied
classes
of
the
free
states
on
the
other
hand
the
free
industrialism
of
those
states
waxed
bolder
in
demands
for
national
protection
with
the
thing
it
fed
on
its
cry
was
always
for
more
and
so
the
tariff
of
was
followed
by
that
of
and
it
in
turn
by
the
one
of
during
which
period
industrial
depression
reached
a
crisis
in
the
south
producing
widespread
distress
among
its
interests
here
is
benton
gloomy
picture
of
that
section
in
in
place
of
wealth
a
universal
pressure
for
money
was
felt
not
enough
for
common
expenses
the
price
of
all
property
down
the
country
drooping
and
languishing
towns
and
cities
decaying
and
the
frugal
habits
of
the
people
pushed
to
the
verge
of
universal
for
the
preservation
of
their
family
estates
what
was
the
cause
of
all
this
misfortune
and
misery
benton
found
it
and
other
southern
leaders
also
in
the
unequal
action
of
federal
fiscal
legislation
under
this
legislation
he
shrewdly
remarks
the
exports
of
the
south
have
been
made
the
basis
of
the
federal
revenue
the
millions
annually
levied
upon
imported
goods
are
deducted
out
of
the
price
of
their
cotton
rice
and
tobacco
either
in
the
diminished
prices
which
they
receive
for
these
staples
in
foreign
ports
or
in
the
increased
price
which
they
pay
for
the
articles
they
have
to
consume
at
home
the
storm
centre
of
this
area
of
industrial
depression
passed
over
virginia
the
carolinas
and
georgia
the
very
heart
of
the
slave
system
was
thus
attacked
by
the
unequal
fiscal
action
of
the
general
government
the
south
needed
for
its
great
staples
of
cotton
rice
and
tobacco
the
freest
access
to
the
markets
of
the
world
and
unrestricted
competition
of
the
world
in
its
own
market
and
this
the
principle
of
protection
denied
to
it
for
the
grand
purpose
of
the
new
policy
of
protection
was
to
occupy
and
retain
as
far
and
as
fast
as
practicable
and
in
some
cases
a
little
farther
and
faster
a
monopoly
of
the
home
market
for
the
products
of
the
new
industrialism
and
therefore
to
exclude
foreign
buyers
and
sellers
therefrom
on
equal
terms
with
their
domestic
rivals
owing
to
the
limitations
of
its
peculiar
labor
the
south
was
disabled
from
adapting
itself
as
the
north
had
just
done
to
changing
circumstances
and
new
economic
conditions
and
so
was
deprived
of
participation
in
the
benefits
of
a
high
tariff
its
slave
system
and
industrial
prosperity
were
accordingly
caught
by
the
free
industrialism
of
the
north
at
a
fatal
disadvantage
and
pressed
mercilessly
to
the
wall
and
so
it
happened
that
the
protective
tariff
which
was
welcomed
as
a
boon
by
one
set
of
industrial
interests
in
the
union
was
by
another
set
at
the
same
time
denounced
as
an
abomination
but
when
the
struggle
between
them
grew
fierce
and
threatened
to
disrupt
the
sections
a
compromise
was
hit
upon
and
a
sort
of
growling
truce
established
for
a
season
whereby
the
industrial
rivals
were
persuaded
that
in
spite
of
the
existence
of
bitter
differences
and
memories
they
could
nevertheless
live
in
peace
and
prosperity
under
the
same
general
government
the
soul
of
the
compromise
measures
of
which
provided
for
the
gradual
abolishment
during
nine
years
of
the
specific
features
of
the
high
tariff
objectionable
to
the
south
failed
however
to
reach
the
real
seat
of
the
trouble
namely
the
counterexpanding
movements
of
the
two
systems
with
their
mutual
inclinations
during
the
operation
to
encroach
the
one
upon
the
other
and
a
natural
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
stronger
to
destroy
the
weaker
in
an
incessant
conflict
for
survivorship
which
would
persist
with
the
certainty
and
constancy
of
a
law
of
nature
compromise
acts
by
congress
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
and
so
the
struggle
for
existence
between
the
two
industrial
forces
went
on
beneath
the
surface
of
things
meanwhile
modern
industrialism
was
gaining
steadily
over
its
slave
competitor
in
social
strength
and
political
importance
and
power
this
conflict
for
industrial
domination
developed
logically
in
an
industrial
republic
into
one
for
political
domination
it
was
unavoidable
under
the
circumstances
that
the
strife
between
our
two
opposing
systems
of
labor
should
gather
about
the
federal
government
and
rage
fiercest
for
its
possession
as
a
supreme
coign
of
vantage
the
power
which
was
devoted
to
the
protection
of
slavery
and
the
power
which
was
devoted
to
the
protection
of
the
new
industrialism
here
locked
horns
in
a
succession
of
engagements
for
position
and
final
mastery
it
seems
to
have
been
early
understood
by
a
sort
of
national
instinct
popular
intuition
that
as
this
issue
between
the
contesting
systems
happened
to
be
decided
the
union
would
thereupon
be
put
in
the
way
of
becoming
eventually
either
wholly
free
or
wholly
slave
as
the
case
might
be
wherefore
the
two
sections
massed
in
time
their
opposing
forces
for
the
long
struggle
at
this
quarter
of
the
field
of
action
it
has
already
been
noted
that
certain
advantages
had
accrued
to
the
south
from
the
original
distribution
of
political
power
under
the
national
constitution
and
from
sundry
cessions
of
territory
to
the
general
government
after
the
adoption
of
that
instrument
but
while
the
south
secured
indeed
the
lion
share
of
those
early
advantages
the
north
got
at
least
two
of
considerable
moment
the
constitutional
provision
for
the
abolition
of
the
african
slave
trade
in
which
imposed
after
that
year
and
from
that
source
a
check
upon
the
numerical
increase
of
slaves
within
the
union
and
secondly
the
ordinance
of
which
excluded
forever
the
peculiar
labor
of
the
south
from
spreading
into
or
taking
root
in
the
northwest
territory
and
therefore
in
that
direction
placed
a
limit
to
its
territorial
expansion
together
they
proved
eventually
of
immense
utility
to
free
industrialism
in
its
strife
with
the
slave
industrial
system
the
first
operating
in
its
favor
negatively
and
the
second
positively
in
the
five
populous
and
prosperous
commonwealths
which
were
subsequently
organized
out
of
this
domain
and
in
which
free
labor
grew
and
multiplied
apace
the
struggle
over
the
admission
of
missouri
into
the
union
terminated
in
a
drawn
battle
in
which
both
sides
gained
and
lost
the
slave
system
obtained
an
additional
slave
state
and
two
others
out
of
the
louisiana
territory
while
free
industrialism
secured
the
erection
of
an
imaginary
fence
through
this
land
to
the
north
of
which
its
slave
rival
was
never
to
settle
maine
was
also
admitted
to
preserve
the
and
balance
of
political
forces
between
the
sections
alas
however
for
the
foresight
of
statesmen
who
build
for
the
present
only
and
are
too
much
engrossed
by
the
cares
and
fears
of
a
day
to
see
far
into
national
realities
or
to
follow
beneath
the
surface
of
things
the
action
of
moral
and
economic
laws
and
to
deduce
therefrom
the
trend
of
national
life
the
slave
wall
of
confidently
counted
upon
by
its
famous
builders
to
constitute
thenceforth
a
permanent
guarantee
of
peace
between
the
rivals
disappointed
these
calculations
for
it
developed
ultimately
into
a
fresh
source
of
discord
and
strife
and
in
view
of
the
unavoidable
conflict
of
our
counterexpanding
systems
of
labor
their
constant
tendency
to
encroach
the
one
upon
the
other
in
the
operation
and
the
bitter
and
dread
and
increasing
demands
of
the
weaker
it
was
impossible
for
the
compromise
of
to
prove
otherwise
the
south
under
the
leadership
of
calhoun
came
presently
to
regard
the
missouri
arrangement
as
a
capital
blunder
on
its
part
and
from
the
standpoint
of
that
section
this
conclusion
seems
strictly
logical
for
the
location
of
a
slave
line
upon
the
louisiana
territory
operated
in
fact
as
a
decided
check
to
the
expansion
of
slavery
as
a
social
rival
and
a
political
power
at
one
and
the
same
time
while
it
added
immensely
to
the
potential
strength
of
the
rapidly
expanding
forces
of
modern
industrialism
in
its
contest
for
social
and
political
supremacy
in
the
union
in
the
growing
exigency
of
the
slave
industrial
system
under
these
circumstances
the
reparation
of
this
blunder
was
deemed
urgent
and
so
in
casting
about
to
find
some
solution
of
its
problem
the
attempted
abrogation
of
the
compromise
law
itself
not
being
considered
wise
by
calhoun
the
slave
power
fell
upon
texas
struggling
for
independence
an
agitation
was
consequently
started
to
correct
the
error
of
the
missouri
compromise
by
the
annexation
of
a
region
of
country
described
in
the
graphic
language
of
webster
to
be
so
vast
that
a
bird
could
not
fly
over
it
in
a
week
what
the
south
had
lost
by
the
blunder
of
the
slave
wall
of
was
then
expected
barring
accidents
of
course
to
be
restored
to
it
in
the
new
slave
states
and
in
the
large
augmentation
of
slave
representation
in
the
general
government
which
would
eventually
ensue
from
the
act
of
annexation
but
the
accident
of
the
mexican
war
wrecked
completely
the
deep
scheme
of
the
texan
plotters
and
neutralized
the
political
advantage
which
had
accrued
to
the
slave
power
in
the
admission
of
texas
into
the
union
by
the
acquisition
of
california
and
new
mexico
at
the
close
of
that
war
it
was
a
checkmate
by
destiny
chance
had
at
a
critical
moment
aligned
itself
definitely
on
the
side
of
modern
industrialism
in
the
american
republic
and
given
a
decisive
turn
to
the
long
contest
with
its
slave
rival
with
the
admission
of
california
as
a
free
state
the
political
balance
between
our
two
opposing
systems
of
labor
was
irreparably
destroyed
for
while
the
south
possessed
texas
and
an
expectation
of
acquiring
new
slave
states
therefrom
this
expectation
amounted
practically
to
a
bare
possibility
for
it
was
found
owing
to
the
inferior
colonizing
resources
of
the
slave
system
far
easier
to
annex
this
immense
domain
than
to
people
it
or
to
organize
out
of
it
states
for
emergent
needs
on
the
other
hand
the
superior
colonizing
ability
of
free
labor
taken
in
conjunction
with
all
that
vast
unoccupied
territory
belonging
to
it
and
inviting
settlement
promised
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
to
increase
and
confirm
this
preponderance
of
political
power
and
so
to
seal
the
fate
of
slavery
nor
do
i
forget
in
this
connection
that
the
bill
which
organized
into
territories
utah
and
new
mexico
was
in
deference
to
southern
demand
purged
of
the
wilmot
but
this
concession
on
the
part
of
northern
politicians
had
no
real
value
to
the
south
for
as
webster
pointed
out
at
the
time
slave
labor
was
effectually
interdicted
from
competing
with
free
labor
for
the
possession
of
this
land
by
a
power
higher
than
the
wilmot
by
a
law
of
nature
the
failure
however
to
this
decree
of
nature
in
prepared
the
way
for
the
demolition
of
the
slave
wall
four
years
later
and
thus
operated
to
hasten
the
grand
catastrophe
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
did
for
the
more
or
less
fluid
state
of
sentiment
at
the
north
what
goethe
says
a
blow
will
do
for
a
vessel
of
water
on
the
verge
of
freezing
the
water
is
thereby
converted
instantly
into
solid
ice
so
did
the
agitation
produced
by
the
abrogation
of
that
act
convert
the
gradually
congealing
sentiment
of
the
free
states
on
the
subject
of
slavery
into
settled
opposition
to
its
farther
extension
to
the
national
territories
and
into
a
fixed
purpose
to
confine
it
within
its
then
existing
limits
but
to
put
immovable
bounds
to
the
territorial
expansion
of
the
slave
industrial
system
was
virtually
under
the
circumstance
to
provide
for
its
decline
and
ultimate
extinction
for
the
beginning
of
a
period
of
actual
and
inhibited
of
slavery
as
a
rival
system
of
labor
in
the
union
would
mark
the
termination
of
its
period
of
growth
and
the
commencement
of
its
industrial
decay
the
peril
of
the
slave
system
was
certainly
extreme
and
the
dread
of
the
slave
power
was
not
less
so
the
national
situation
was
full
of
gloom
and
menace
to
the
industrial
rivals
for
the
passions
of
the
slave
power
were
taking
on
an
ominously
violent
and
reckless
energy
of
expression
which
unless
all
signs
fail
would
take
on
presently
a
no
less
violent
and
reckless
energy
of
action
the
crisis
was
intensified
first
by
the
repeal
on
the
part
of
certain
free
states
of
their
laws
second
by
the
extraordinary
activity
of
the
underground
railroad
third
by
increasing
opposition
in
the
north
to
the
execution
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
all
of
which
acting
together
seriously
impaired
the
value
and
security
of
slave
property
in
the
union
fourth
by
that
fierce
obstinate
but
futile
struggle
of
the
south
to
obtain
possession
of
kansas
and
the
exposure
thereby
of
its
marked
inferiority
as
a
colonizer
in
competition
with
modern
industrialism
fifth
by
the
growing
influence
of
the
abolition
movement
and
sixth
by
those
nameless
terrors
of
slave
insurrections
which
were
evoked
by
the
apparition
of
john
brown
at
harper
ferry
this
acute
situation
was
finally
rendered
intolerable
to
the
slave
power
upon
the
election
of
abraham
lincoln
on
a
sectional
platform
pledged
to
a
policy
of
uncompromising
resistance
to
the
farther
extension
of
slavery
to
the
territories
worsted
within
the
union
it
was
natural
that
the
south
should
refuse
to
yield
at
this
point
of
the
conflict
and
that
it
should
make
an
attempt
as
a
dernier
resort
to
secede
from
it
with
its
peculiar
institution
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
the
battle
for
its
existence
outside
of
a
political
system
in
which
it
had
been
overborne
and
hemmed
in
upon
itself
by
modern
industrialism
and
so
doomed
by
that
inexorable
force
to
slow
but
absolutely
certain
extinction
but
the
union
which
had
developed
such
deadly
industrial
peril
to
the
south
had
created
for
the
north
its
immense
industrial
prosperity
was
in
sooth
the
origin
and
mainspring
of
its
powerful
and
progressive
civilization
and
so
while
the
preservation
of
the
peculiar
institution
and
civilization
of
the
former
necessitated
a
rupture
of
the
old
union
and
the
formation
of
a
new
one
founded
on
negro
slavery
every
interest
and
attachment
of
the
latter
cried
out
for
the
maintenance
of
the
old
and
the
destruction
of
the
new
government
the
long
conflict
of
the
two
rival
systems
of
labor
culminated
in
the
war
to
save
the
old
union
on
the
part
of
the
north
and
to
establish
a
new
one
on
the
part
of
the
south
whose
constitution
rested
directly
upon
the
doctrine
of
social
unity
social
duality
was
the
great
fact
in
the
constitution
of
the
old
union
social
uniformity
was
to
be
the
great
fact
in
the
new
a
state
divided
socially
against
itself
can
not
stand
the
south
learned
this
supreme
lesson
in
political
philosophy
well
much
more
quickly
and
thoroughly
than
had
the
north
whose
comprehension
of
it
was
painfully
slow
and
even
that
part
of
the
grand
truth
which
it
did
come
to
apprehend
after
prolonged
wrestlings
with
bitter
experience
it
reduced
to
practice
in
every
emergency
with
moral
fears
and
tremblings
in
the
tremendous
trial
of
strength
between
the
sections
which
followed
the
rebel
shot
on
sumter
the
south
was
at
the
end
of
four
years
completely
overmatched
by
the
north
and
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
and
material
resources
was
borne
down
at
all
points
and
forced
back
into
the
old
union
less
its
system
of
slave
labor
for
the
destruction
of
the
southern
confederacy
had
involved
as
a
military
necessity
the
destruction
of
negro
slavery
which
was
its
chief
cornerstone
with
the
adoption
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
ancient
cause
of
sectional
difference
and
strife
duality
of
labor
systems
was
supposed
quite
generally
at
the
north
to
have
been
removed
and
that
a
new
era
of
unity
in
this
respect
had
thereupon
straightway
begun
it
seems
to
have
been
little
understood
by
the
north
at
the
time
and
since
for
that
matter
that
negro
slavery
in
the
south
would
die
hard
and
that
it
has
a
fatal
gift
of
metamorphosis
ability
to
change
its
form
without
changing
its
nature
and
that
while
it
had
under
the
stroke
of
the
national
arm
disappeared
as
chattel
slavery
it
would
reappear
unless
hindered
as
african
serfdom
throughout
the
southern
states
and
that
they
would
return
to
the
union
much
stronger
politically
than
when
they
seceded
and
much
better
equipped
for
a
renewal
of
the
unquenched
strife
for
industrial
existence
in
than
they
were
in
the
immediate
work
of
reconstructing
civil
society
in
the
old
slave
states
to
meet
the
new
condition
of
freedom
was
now
by
an
egregious
executive
blunder
left
wholly
to
the
master
class
with
the
startling
result
at
its
close
that
whereas
negro
slavery
had
been
abolished
negro
serfdom
reappeared
in
every
instance
as
the
industrial
basis
of
the
reconstructed
states
and
that
a
serf
power
was
about
to
take
the
place
of
the
slave
power
in
the
newly
restored
union
more
dangerous
than
the
old
slave
power
to
free
industrialism
than
five
is
greater
than
three
in
federal
numbers
for
while
according
to
the
old
rule
of
slave
representation
in
the
lower
house
of
congress
it
took
five
slaves
to
nullify
the
votes
of
three
freemen
under
a
new
rule
of
apportionment
which
would
probably
obtain
five
serfs
would
be
equivalent
politically
to
five
freemen
at
this
all
the
ancient
hatred
and
dread
of
its
protean
rival
blazed
hotly
in
the
heart
of
the
north
and
with
its
passionate
fear
emerged
a
no
less
passionate
desire
to
secure
forever
the
domination
of
its
industrial
democracy
over
the
newborn
nation
actuated
by
this
motive
to
dominate
the
republic
the
freedmen
whom
the
old
master
class
had
by
prompt
legislation
reduced
to
a
condition
of
serfdom
were
thereupon
raised
by
the
north
through
constitutional
amendment
to
the
plane
of
citizenship
and
when
this
act
proved
inadequate
to
arrest
the
threatened
southern
revival
in
the
national
government
the
ballot
was
next
placed
in
their
hands
to
avert
the
impending
danger
it
was
under
such
circumstances
that
the
work
of
southern
reconstruction
was
entered
upon
by
congress
in
reality
by
the
north
the
south
having
had
its
chance
and
failed
to
reconstruct
itself
upon
a
basis
satisfactory
to
its
victorious
rival
and
in
consonance
with
its
sense
of
industrial
and
political
security
and
progress
i
know
that
it
is
now
the
universal
vogue
to
criticize
and
condemn
this
stupendous
work
of
congress
as
wholly
wanting
in
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
as
woefully
deficient
in
wise
statesmanship
i
know
also
that
hindsight
is
at
all
times
attended
with
less
embarrassment
to
him
who
uses
it
than
is
foresight
and
i
know
besides
that
those
historic
actors
who
had
not
attained
unto
a
position
of
futurity
in
respect
to
their
task
but
whose
task
sustained
to
them
that
relative
place
instead
were
obliged
to
do
the
best
they
could
with
whatever
quantum
of
the
latter
faculty
they
might
have
possessed
and
toward
the
manful
achievement
of
their
duty
and
this
is
what
congress
did
at
this
juncture
in
view
of
the
long
bitter
and
disastrous
strife
between
the
two
sets
of
industrial
ideas
and
interests
in
the
republic
of
the
complex
and
earthquake
circumstances
and
conditions
in
which
they
were
thrown
in
relation
to
each
other
at
the
close
of
the
rebellion
together
with
the
imperious
urgency
for
immediate
and
decisive
action
on
the
part
of
the
north
i
confess
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
see
even
with
the
aid
of
hindsight
what
other
practicable
course
was
then
open
to
that
section
to
pursue
than
the
one
selected
by
congress
in
the
emergency
as
the
best
and
wisest
and
all
things
considered
it
was
the
best
and
wisest
which
when
the
present
generation
of
criticism
and
reaction
has
passed
will
i
think
be
so
adjudged
by
impartial
truth
congress
might
at
this
juncture
have
led
the
country
by
another
way
out
of
the
perils
which
threatened
afresh
its
peace
and
security
by
a
way
dreadful
and
inhuman
it
is
true
but
which
offered
nevertheless
a
radical
and
permanent
cure
for
the
evils
which
flow
naturally
from
the
union
under
one
general
government
of
two
mutually
invasive
and
destructive
industrial
systems
by
the
forcible
deportation
of
the
entire
black
population
of
the
south
and
the
introduction
into
their
stead
of
an
equal
number
of
white
immigrants
such
a
course
would
have
certainly
achieved
the
unification
of
the
sections
by
the
extinguishment
and
elimination
of
the
weaker
of
our
two
rival
systems
of
labor
it
was
however
a
solution
of
its
southern
problem
which
the
nation
was
in
morals
economics
and
humanity
precluded
absolutely
from
adopting
for
three
simple
and
sufficient
reasons
first
for
the
sake
of
the
south
which
wasted
and
bewildered
lay
sullen
and
prostrate
amidst
the
wreck
and
chaos
of
civil
strife
and
at
its
lowest
ebb
of
productive
energy
and
wealth
its
sole
recuperative
chance
depending
on
the
labor
of
its
former
slaves
to
deport
this
labor
under
the
circumstances
would
have
been
cruelly
to
deprive
that
section
of
its
last
vital
resource
and
to
sink
it
to
a
state
of
industrial
collapse
and
misery
by
the
side
of
which
its
condition
at
the
close
of
the
war
might
have
seemed
prosperity
and
paradise
second
the
nation
itself
could
ill
sustain
the
shock
incident
to
such
a
huge
amputation
from
the
body
of
its
productive
labor
and
which
must
have
for
long
and
bitter
years
affected
disastrously
its
solvency
greatness
and
progress
besides
the
presence
in
the
lately
rebellious
states
of
a
mass
of
loyal
people
like
the
blacks
constituted
an
immensely
important
element
of
strength
and
security
to
the
newly
restored
union
and
third
the
blacks
themselves
had
by
two
centuries
of
unpaid
toil
bought
the
right
to
remain
in
a
country
which
had
enslaved
them
yet
for
whose
defense
and
preservation
against
foreign
and
domestic
foes
and
through
three
wars
they
had
bared
their
brave
arms
and
generous
breasts
and
poured
out
royally
and
without
measure
their
devotion
their
blood
and
their
life
the
general
welfare
of
the
reunited
nation
demanded
not
only
political
unification
of
the
states
under
one
supreme
government
but
their
social
unification
as
well
on
a
common
industrial
basis
of
free
labor
the
coexistence
under
the
old
constitution
of
two
contrary
systems
of
labor
had
given
rise
to
seventy
years
of
strife
and
rivalry
between
the
sections
and
had
plunged
them
finally
into
one
of
the
fiercest
and
most
destructive
wars
of
modern
times
it
was
clearly
recognized
at
the
close
of
that
war
that
the
foundations
of
the
restored
union
should
be
made
to
rest
directly
on
the
enduring
bedrock
of
a
uniform
system
of
free
labor
for
both
sections
not
as
formerly
on
the
shifting
sands
of
two
conflicting
social
orders
for
as
long
as
our
ancient
duality
of
labor
system
shall
continue
to
exist
there
will
necessarily
continue
to
exist
also
duality
of
ideas
interests
and
institutions
i
do
not
mean
mere
variety
in
these
regards
which
operates
beneficiently
but
profound
and
abiding
social
and
political
differences
engendering
profound
and
abiding
social
and
political
antagonisms
naturally
and
inevitably
affecting
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
national
stability
and
security
and
leaving
everywhere
in
the
subconscious
life
of
the
republic
a
sense
of
vague
uneasiness
rising
periodically
to
the
keenest
anxiety
like
the
dread
felt
by
a
city
subject
to
seismic
disturbances
for
what
has
once
happened
the
cause
continuing
may
happen
again
the
southern
soil
was
at
the
moment
broken
up
roughly
by
the
hot
ploughshare
of
civil
war
it
might
have
been
better
prepared
for
the
reception
of
the
good
seed
by
the
slower
process
of
social
evolution
but
the
guiding
spirits
of
that
era
had
no
choice
the
tide
of
an
immense
historic
opportunity
had
risen
it
was
at
its
flood
then
was
the
accepted
hour
then
or
never
it
appeared
to
them
and
so
they
scattered
broadcast
seed
ideas
of
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
their
inalienable
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
the
derivation
of
the
powers
of
all
just
governments
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
these
revolutionary
ideas
fell
alongside
of
the
uptorn
but
living
roots
of
other
and
hostile
political
principles
and
of
the
ramified
and
prejudices
of
an
old
social
order
and
had
forthwith
to
engage
in
a
life
and
death
struggle
against
tremendous
odds
for
existence
many
there
are
who
see
in
the
reconstruction
period
nothing
except
the
asserted
incapacity
of
the
negro
for
nothing
but
rule
and
its
attendant
corruption
but
bad
as
those
governments
were
they
were
nevertheless
the
actual
vehicles
which
conveyed
into
the
south
the
seeds
of
our
industrial
democracy
and
of
a
new
social
and
political
order
from
that
period
dates
the
beginning
of
an
absolutely
new
epoch
for
that
section
the
forces
set
free
then
in
the
old
slave
states
have
been
gradually
unfolding
themselves
amid
giant
difficulties
ever
since
they
are
i
believe
in
the
south
to
stay
and
are
destined
ultimately
to
conquer
every
square
inch
of
its
mind
and
matter
and
so
to
produce
the
perfect
unification
of
the
republic
by
producing
the
perfect
unification
of
its
immense
heterogeneous
population
regardless
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
on
the
broad
basis
of
industrial
and
political
equality
and
fair
play
the
contest
of
the
old
industrial
rivals
has
in
consequence
of
this
influx
of
democratic
ideas
into
the
south
and
the
resultant
modification
of
environment
there
taken
on
fresh
and
deplorable
complications
the
struggle
between
the
old
and
the
new
which
is
in
progress
throughout
that
section
is
no
longer
a
simple
conflict
between
the
two
sets
of
industrial
principles
of
the
union
along
sectional
lines
as
formerly
but
along
race
lines
now
as
well
the
truths
of
the
declaration
of
independence
invading
the
old
slave
states
have
divided
that
house
against
itself
their
powerful
ally
popular
education
is
creating
everywhere
moral
unrest
and
discontent
with
present
injustices
and
a
growing
desire
on
the
part
of
the
negro
to
have
what
is
denied
him
but
which
others
enjoy
free
and
equal
opportunities
in
the
rivalry
of
life
this
battle
of
ideas
in
the
south
is
in
reality
a
battle
for
the
enduring
unification
of
the
sections
the
permanent
pacification
of
the
republic
the
labors
of
the
fathers
for
a
more
perfect
union
will
have
been
in
vain
unless
the
negro
wins
in
this
irrepressible
conflict
between
the
two
industrial
systems
of
the
country
it
is
greatly
to
be
lamented
that
a
question
of
color
and
difference
of
race
has
so
completely
disabled
the
nation
and
the
south
from
seeing
things
relating
to
this
momentous
subject
clear
and
seeing
them
straight
those
who
see
in
this
problem
only
a
conflict
of
races
in
the
south
see
but
a
little
way
into
its
depths
for
underlying
this
conflict
of
races
is
a
conflict
of
opposing
ideas
and
interests
which
have
for
a
century
vexed
the
peace
of
the
nation
the
existence
of
a
system
of
labor
in
the
south
distinct
from
that
of
the
north
separated
the
two
halves
of
the
union
industrially
as
far
as
the
east
is
from
the
west
made
of
them
in
truth
two
hostile
nations
although
united
under
one
general
government
this
difference
has
been
the
cause
of
all
the
division
and
strife
between
the
sections
and
it
will
continue
to
operate
as
such
till
completely
abolished
the
clinging
of
the
south
under
the
circumstances
to
its
old
social
and
political
ideas
and
system
or
to
such
fragments
of
them
as
now
remain
and
its
persistent
attempts
to
put
these
broken
parts
together
and
to
preserve
thereby
what
so
disastrously
distinguishes
it
from
the
rest
of
the
country
is
an
economic
error
of
the
first
magnitude
an
error
which
injuriously
affects
its
own
industrial
prosperity
and
greatness
by
retarding
its
material
development
and
by
infecting
at
the
same
time
with
increasing
unrest
and
discontent
its
faithful
and
peaceful
black
labor
the
fight
which
the
south
is
making
along
this
line
is
a
fight
not
half
so
much
against
the
negro
as
against
its
own
highest
good
and
that
of
the
country
for
it
has
in
this
matter
opposed
itself
ignorantly
and
madly
to
the
great
laws
which
control
the
economic
world
to
the
great
laws
which
are
the
soul
of
modern
industrialism
laws
which
govern
production
and
exchange
consumption
and
competition
supply
and
demand
which
determine
everywhere
between
rival
parts
of
the
same
country
and
between
rival
nations
as
well
that
commercial
struggles
industrial
rivalries
shall
always
terminate
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
if
in
such
a
battle
the
south
sow
seeds
of
economic
weakness
when
it
ought
to
sow
seeds
of
economic
strength
it
will
go
down
before
its
rivals
whether
those
rivals
be
in
this
country
or
in
any
other
country
or
part
of
the
world
in
such
a
struggle
if
it
would
win
it
will
need
to
avail
itself
of
all
the
means
which
god
and
nature
have
placed
at
its
disposition
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
means
perhaps
the
most
important
single
factor
in
the
development
and
prosperity
of
the
south
is
its
negro
labor
it
is
more
to
it
if
viewed
aright
than
all
of
its
gold
iron
and
coal
mines
put
together
if
properly
treated
and
trained
it
will
mean
fabulous
wealth
and
greatness
to
that
section
lest
you
say
that
i
exaggerate
i
will
quote
the
estimate
put
upon
this
labor
by
the
washington
which
will
hardly
be
accused
of
enthusiasm
touching
any
matter
relating
to
the
negro
i
think
here
it
is
we
hold
as
between
the
ignorant
of
the
two
races
the
negro
is
preferable
they
are
conservative
they
are
good
citizens
they
take
no
stock
in
social
schisms
and
vagaries
they
do
not
consort
with
anarchists
they
can
not
be
made
the
tools
and
agents
of
incendiaries
they
constitute
the
solid
worthy
estimable
yeomanry
of
the
south
their
influence
in
government
would
be
infinitely
more
wholesome
than
the
influence
of
the
white
sansculottes
the
the
idlers
the
rowdies
and
the
outlaws
as
between
the
negro
no
matter
how
illiterate
he
may
be
and
the
poor
white
the
property
owners
of
the
south
prefer
the
former
the
south
can
not
economically
eat
its
cake
and
have
it
too
it
can
not
adopt
a
policy
and
a
code
of
laws
to
degrade
its
negro
labor
to
hedge
it
about
with
unequal
restrictions
and
prescriptive
legislation
and
raise
it
at
the
same
time
to
the
highest
state
of
productive
efficiency
but
it
must
as
an
economic
necessity
raise
this
labor
to
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
or
suffer
inevitable
industrial
feebleness
and
inferiority
what
are
the
things
which
have
made
free
labor
at
the
north
the
most
productive
labor
in
the
world
and
of
untold
value
and
wealth
to
that
section
what
but
its
intelligence
skill
and
power
of
initiative
and
how
have
these
qualities
been
put
into
it
i
answer
unhesitatingly
by
those
twin
systems
of
universal
education
and
popular
suffrage
one
system
trains
the
children
the
other
the
adult
population
the
same
wide
diffusion
of
knowledge
and
large
and
equal
freedom
and
participation
in
the
affairs
of
government
which
have
done
so
much
for
northern
labor
can
not
possibly
do
less
for
southern
labor
for
weal
or
woe
the
negro
is
in
the
south
to
stay
he
will
never
leave
it
voluntarily
and
forcible
deportation
of
him
is
impracticable
and
for
economic
reasons
vital
to
that
section
as
we
have
seen
he
must
not
be
oppressed
or
repressed
all
attempts
to
push
and
tie
him
down
to
the
dead
level
of
an
inferior
caste
to
restrict
his
activities
arbitrarily
and
permanently
to
hewing
wood
and
drawing
water
for
the
white
race
without
regard
to
his
possibilities
for
higher
things
is
in
this
age
of
strenuous
industrial
competition
and
struggle
an
economic
blunder
pure
and
simple
to
say
nothing
of
the
immorality
of
such
action
like
water
let
the
negro
find
his
natural
level
if
the
south
would
get
the
best
and
the
most
out
of
him
if
nature
has
designed
him
to
serve
the
white
race
forever
never
fear
he
will
not
be
able
to
elude
nature
he
will
not
escape
his
destiny
but
he
must
be
allowed
to
act
freely
nature
does
not
need
our
aid
here
depend
upon
it
she
will
make
no
mistake
her
inexorable
laws
provide
for
the
survival
of
the
fittest
only
let
the
negro
freely
find
himself
whether
in
doing
so
he
falls
or
rises
in
the
scale
of
life
with
his
labor
the
negro
is
in
the
market
of
the
world
if
all
things
considered
he
has
the
best
article
for
the
price
offered
he
will
sell
otherwise
not
but
it
is
of
immense
value
and
moment
to
the
south
in
both
respects
if
his
labor
in
all
departments
of
industry
in
which
it
may
be
employed
be
raised
by
education
of
head
and
hand
by
the
largest
freedom
and
equality
of
opportunities
to
the
highest
efficiency
of
which
it
is
capable
who
more
than
the
south
will
reap
its
resultant
benefits
so
will
the
whole
country
reap
the
resultant
benefits
in
the
diffused
and
productivity
of
its
laboring
classes
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
final
removal
of
the
ancient
cause
of
difference
and
discord
between
its
parts
but
if
the
negro
fail
by
reason
of
inherent
fitness
to
survive
in
such
a
struggle
his
failure
will
be
followed
by
decline
in
numbers
and
ultimate
extinction
which
will
involve
no
violent
dislocation
of
the
labor
of
the
republic
but
a
displacement
so
gradual
that
while
one
race
is
vanishing
another
will
be
silently
crowding
into
the
space
thus
vacated
the
commercial
and
industrial
rivalry
of
the
nations
of
the
world
was
never
so
sharp
and
intense
as
at
the
present
time
and
all
signs
point
to
increased
competition
among
them
during
this
century
in
this
contest
the
labor
of
each
country
is
primarily
the
grand
determining
factor
it
must
from
sheer
necessity
and
stress
of
circumstances
be
brought
in
each
instance
to
the
highest
state
of
economic
efficiency
by
every
resource
in
the
possession
of
the
respective
world
rivals
and
this
will
be
attempted
in
the
future
by
each
of
these
world
rivals
on
a
grandeur
of
scale
and
with
a
scientific
thoroughness
and
energy
in
the
use
of
educational
means
not
yet
realized
by
the
most
progressive
of
them
for
those
nations
who
succeed
best
in
this
respect
will
prevail
over
those
others
which
fail
to
raise
their
labor
to
an
equally
high
grade
of
efficiency
now
if
negro
labor
is
the
best
for
its
climate
and
needs
the
south
must
seek
earnestly
constantly
by
every
means
in
its
power
to
raise
that
labor
to
the
highest
state
of
economic
efficiency
of
which
it
is
capable
that
section
must
do
so
in
spite
of
its
chimerical
fears
of
negro
domination
in
spite
of
its
rooted
race
prejudices
it
must
educate
and
emancipate
this
labor
all
hostile
sentiment
of
whatever
nature
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
if
it
will
hold
its
own
in
that
great
cosmic
struggle
for
existence
in
which
it
is
now
engaged
with
powerful
rivals
at
home
and
abroad
nor
can
the
republic
be
indifferent
on
this
head
no
country
in
this
age
of
strenuous
commercial
competition
can
forget
with
impunity
its
duty
in
this
regard
neglect
here
brings
swift
retribution
to
any
nation
which
carries
a
vast
horde
of
crude
and
relatively
inefficient
labor
into
an
industrial
struggle
with
the
rest
of
the
world
for
the
world
labor
will
henceforth
assume
more
and
more
the
character
of
vast
standing
armies
engaged
in
industrial
warfare
each
unit
of
these
industrial
armies
will
be
ultimately
trained
and
disciplined
to
the
highest
possible
efficiency
and
will
some
time
form
together
perfect
machines
which
will
operate
with
precision
and
purpose
at
any
given
quarter
of
the
field
of
action
in
obedience
to
the
first
law
of
nature
our
country
in
its
battle
with
industrial
rivals
to
retain
present
advantages
and
win
new
ones
in
world
markets
will
have
to
elevate
the
whole
body
of
its
labor
regardless
of
color
or
race
to
the
highest
state
of
economic
productivity
of
which
that
labor
is
capable
in
all
of
its
parts
colossal
forces
are
behind
and
under
the
movement
which
is
making
for
the
final
emancipation
of
the
negro
and
for
his
eventual
admission
on
terms
of
complete
equality
of
rights
and
opportunities
into
the
arena
of
that
rivalry
and
struggle
which
is
the
law
of
progress
the
negro
has
proved
himself
one
of
the
best
soldiers
in
the
world
he
will
prove
himself
in
this
country
provided
fair
play
be
accorded
him
one
of
the
most
productive
laborers
in
the
world
also
he
has
the
capacity
for
becoming
one
of
the
best
laborers
and
artisans
in
our
industrial
army
of
conquest
and
one
of
the
best
citizens
of
the
republic
likewise
overcome
then
your
prejudices
ye
white
men
of
the
south
and
ye
white
men
too
of
the
north
trust
the
negro
in
peace
as
ye
have
trusted
him
in
war
nor
forget
that
the
freest
and
most
intelligent
labor
is
ever
the
best
and
most
productive
labor
and
that
liberal
and
equal
laws
and
institutions
are
the
one
unerring
way
yet
discovered
by
human
experience
and
wisdom
whereby
modern
industrialism
and
democracy
may
reach
their
highest
development
and
the
highest
development
of
humanity
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
age
of
the
people
of
consolidation
and
competition
it
is
the
age
of
industrialism
and
democracy
aye
industrialism
and
democracy
are
destiny
try
ever
so
hard
we
shall
not
escape
our
destiny
neither
the
negro
nor
the
south
nor
the
nation
