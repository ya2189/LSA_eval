preface
i
should
like
to
explain
that
this
work
being
with
one
or
two
insignificant
exceptions
a
record
of
my
own
observations
only
it
has
not
been
my
intention
to
make
general
statements
in
regard
to
the
habits
of
any
particular
bird
in
practice
however
it
is
often
difficult
to
write
as
if
one
were
not
doing
this
without
its
having
a
very
clumsy
effect
one
can
not
for
instance
always
say
i
have
seen
birds
fly
one
has
to
say
upon
occasions
birds
fly
moreover
it
is
obvious
that
in
much
of
the
more
important
business
of
one
would
be
fully
justified
in
arguing
from
the
particular
to
the
general
perhaps
though
this
is
not
my
opinion
one
would
always
be
but
whether
this
is
the
case
or
not
i
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
throughout
a
remark
that
any
bird
acts
in
such
or
such
a
way
means
merely
that
i
have
on
one
or
more
occasions
seen
it
do
so
also
all
that
i
have
seen
which
is
included
in
this
volume
was
noted
down
by
me
either
just
after
it
had
taken
place
or
whilst
it
actually
was
taking
place
the
quotations
except
when
literary
or
otherwise
explicitly
stated
being
always
from
my
own
notes
so
made
for
this
reason
i
call
my
work
bird
watching
and
i
hope
that
the
title
will
explain
and
even
justify
a
good
deal
which
in
itself
is
certainly
a
want
and
a
failing
one
can
not
unfortunately
watch
all
birds
and
of
those
that
one
can
it
is
difficult
not
to
say
at
once
too
little
and
too
much
too
little
because
one
may
have
only
had
the
luck
to
see
well
a
single
point
in
the
round
of
activities
of
any
species
one
feather
in
its
plumage
so
to
speak
and
too
much
because
even
to
speak
of
this
adequately
is
to
fill
many
pages
and
deny
space
to
some
other
bird
all
i
can
do
is
to
speak
of
some
few
birds
as
i
have
watched
them
in
some
few
things
those
who
read
this
preface
will
i
hope
expect
nothing
more
and
i
hope
that
not
much
more
is
implied
in
the
title
which
i
have
chosen
perhaps
i
might
have
been
more
explicit
but
english
is
not
german
does
not
seem
to
go
well
as
a
compound
and
observations
on
sounds
as
formidable
as
beobachtungen
über
it
matters
not
how
one
may
limit
it
the
word
observations
has
a
terrific
sound
let
a
man
say
merely
that
he
watched
a
robin
for
instance
doing
something
and
no
one
will
shrink
from
him
but
if
he
talks
about
his
observations
on
the
then
let
these
have
been
ever
so
restricted
and
even
though
he
may
forbear
to
call
the
bird
by
its
latin
name
he
must
expect
to
pay
the
penalty
the
very
limitations
will
have
something
severe
smacking
of
precise
scientific
distinction
about
them
and
the
implied
preference
for
english
in
such
a
case
will
appear
affected
and
to
be
a
clumsy
attempt
merely
to
make
himself
popular
therefore
i
will
not
call
my
book
observations
on
etc
i
have
birds
only
i
have
not
them
it
is
true
that
in
the
text
itself
i
do
not
shrink
from
the
latter
word
either
as
substantive
or
verb
or
even
from
the
latin
name
of
a
bird
here
and
there
when
i
happen
to
know
it
for
is
there
not
such
a
thing
as
childish
pride
but
that
is
different
i
do
not
begin
at
once
in
that
way
and
by
the
time
i
get
to
it
anyone
will
have
found
me
out
and
know
that
i
am
really
quite
harmless
besides
i
have
now
set
matters
in
their
right
light
but
i
was
not
going
to
handicap
myself
upon
my
very
cover
and
trust
to
its
contents
merely
for
getting
over
it
that
would
have
been
again
in
the
following
pages
there
are
some
points
which
i
just
touch
upon
and
leave
with
an
undertaking
to
go
more
fully
into
in
a
subsequent
chapter
this
i
have
always
meant
to
do
but
want
of
space
has
in
some
instances
prevented
me
from
carrying
out
my
intention
for
this
i
will
apologise
only
leaving
it
to
my
readers
to
excuse
me
should
they
think
fit
perhaps
they
will
do
so
very
readily
also
but
i
can
not
afford
to
point
out
any
more
of
my
shortcomings
that
too
i
must
leave
to
the
reader
who
i
hope
will
in
this
matter
but
little
deserve
that
epithet
of
discerning
which
is
often
so
generously
not
to
say
boldly
bestowed

him

watching

plovers
etc
if
life
is
as
some
hold
it
to
be
a
vast
melancholy
ocean
over
which
ships
more
or
less
continually
pass
and
ply
yet
there
lie
here
and
there
upon
it
isles
of
consolation
on
to
which
we
may
step
out
and
for
a
time
forget
the
winds
and
waves
one
of
these
we
may
call
the
island
of
watching
and
being
entertained
by
the
habits
and
humours
of
birds
and
upon
this
one
for
with
the
others
i
have
here
nothing
to
do
i
will
straightway
land
inviting
such
as
may
care
to
to
follow
me
i
will
speak
of
birds
only
or
almost
only
as
i
have
seen
them
and
i
must
hope
that
this
plan
which
is
the
only
one
i
have
found
myself
able
to
follow
will
be
accepted
as
an
apology
for
the
absence
of
much
which
not
having
seen
but
only
read
of
i
therefore
say
nothing
about
also
if
i
sometimes
here
record
what
has
long
been
known
and
noted
as
though
i
were
making
a
discovery
i
trust
that
this
too
will
be
forgiven
me
for
in
fact
whenever
i
have
watched
a
bird
and
seen
it
do
anything
at
all
anything
that
is
at
all
salient
that
is
just
how
i
have
felt
perhaps
indeed
the
best
way
to
make
discoveries
of
this
sort
is
to
have
the
idea
that
one
is
doing
so
one
looks
with
the
soul
in
the
eyes
then
and
so
may
sometimes
pick
up
some
trifle
or
other
that
has
not
been
noted
before
however
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
delightful
birds
for
one
must
begin
somewhere
to
find
or
to
think
one
is
finding
things
out
about
is
the
great
or
norfolk
plover
or
as
it
is
locally
and
more
rightly
called
for
it
is
a
curlew
and
not
a
plover
the
these
birds
haunt
open
sandy
wastes
to
which
but
the
scantiest
of
vegetation
clings
and
here
during
the
day
they
assemble
in
some
chosen
spot
often
in
considerable
numbers
fifty
or
more
i
have
sometimes
seen
together
if
it
is
early
in
the
day
and
especially
if
the
weather
be
warm
and
sunny
most
of
them
will
be
sitting
either
crouched
down
on
their
long
yellow
shanks
or
more
upright
with
these
extended
in
front
of
them
looking
in
this
latter
attitude
as
if
they
were
standing
on
their
stumps
their
legs
having
been
smitten
off
and
lying
before
them
on
the
ground
towards
evening
however
which
is
the
best
time
to
watch
these
birds
they
stand
attending
to
their
plumage
or
walk
with
picked
steps
in
a
leisurely
fashion
which
with
their
lean
gaunt
figure
sad
and
rusty
coloured
and
a
certain
sedateness
almost
punctiliousness
of
manner
fancifully
suggests
to
one
the
figure
of
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
the
knight
of
the
rueful
countenance
with
a
touch
or
two
perhaps
thrown
in
of
the
old
baron
of
bradwardine
of
tullyveolan
one
can
lie
on
the
ground
and
watch
them
from
far
off
through
the
glasses
or
should
a
belt
of
bracken
fringe
the
barren
area
one
has
then
an
excellent
opportunity
of
creeping
up
to
within
a
short
or
at
least
a
reasonable
distance
to
do
this
one
must
make
a
wide
circuit
and
enter
the
bracken
a
long
way
off
then
having
walked
or
rather
waded
for
some
way
towards
them
at
a
certain
point
experience
will
teach
the
one
must
sink
on
hands
and
knees
and
the
rest
is
all
creeping
and
wriggling
till
at
length
lying
flat
one
face
just
pierces
the
edge
of
the
cover
and
the
harmless
glasses
are
levelled
at
the
quarry
one
does
not
wish
to
kill
the
birds
are
standing
in
a
long
straggling
line
in
form
swelling
out
into
knots
where
they
are
grouped
more
thickly
with
thinner
spaces
between
as
they
preen
themselves
twisting
the
neck
to
one
or
the
other
side
so
as
to
pass
the
primary
quill
feathers
of
the
wings
through
the
beak
one
may
be
seen
to
stoop
and
lay
one
side
of
the
head
on
the
ground
the
great
yellow
eye
of
the
other
side
staring
up
into
the
sky
in
an
uncanny
sort
of
way
the
meaning
of
this
action
i
do
not
know
it
is
not
to
scratch
the
head
for
the
head
is
held
quite
still
and
moreover
as
like
most
birds
they
can
do
this
very
neatly
and
effectively
with
the
foot
other
methods
would
seem
to
be
superfluous
again
and
this
is
a
more
characteristic
action
one
having
stood
for
some
time
upright
and
perfectly
still
makes
a
sudden
and
very
swingy
bob
forward
with
the
head
the
tail
at
the
same
time
swinging
up
just
in
the
way
that
a
wooden
bird
performs
these
actions
upon
one
pulling
a
string
this
again
seems
to
have
no
special
reference
to
anything
unless
it
be
deportment
i
understand
professor
newton
to
say
this
all
at
once
a
bird
makes
a
swift
run
forward
not
one
of
those
short
little
dainty
runs
one
and
then
another
and
another
with
little
between
that
one
knows
so
well
but
a
long
steady
run
down
upon
something
and
at
the
same
moment
the
glasses
if
one
is
lucky
and
the
distance
not
too
great
reveal
the
object
which
has
occasioned
this
a
delicate
white
thing
floating
in
the
air
which
one
takes
to
be
a
this
is
secured
and
eaten
and
we
may
imagine
that
the
bird
peckings
at
it
after
it
is
in
his
possession
are
to
disengage
the
seed
from
the
down
but
all
at
once
before
you
have
had
time
to
set
down
the
glasses
and
make
the
note
that
the
great
plover
will
snap
at
a
wandering
and
having
separated
the
delicate
little
from
the
seed
eat
the
latter
a
small
brown
moth
comes
into
view
flying
low
over
a
belt
of
dry
bushy
grass
that
helps
with
the
bracken
to
edge
the
sandy
warren
for
these
wastes
are
given
over
to
rabbits
and
large
landowners
and
are
marked
warrens
on
the
map
instantly
the
same
bird
who
seems
to
catch
sight
of
the
moth
just
as
you
do
starts
in
pursuit
with
the
same
rapid
run
and
head
stretched
eagerly
out
he
gets
up
to
the
moth
and
essays
to
catch
it
pecking
at
it
in
a
very
peculiar
way
not
excitedly
or
wildly
but
with
little
precise
pecks
the
head
closely
and
guardedly
following
the
moth
motions
the
whole
strongly
suggestive
of
professional
skill
the
moth
eludes
him
however
and
the
bird
stops
rigidly
having
apparently
lost
sight
of
it
shortly
afterwards
after
it
has
flown
some
way
he
sees
it
again
and
makes
another
swift
run
in
pursuit
catching
it
up
again
and
making
his
quick
little
pecks
but
unsuccessfully
as
before
then
there
is
the
same
pause
followed
by
the
same
run
then
a
close
near
chase
and
finally
the
moth
is
caught
and
eaten
other
moths
or
other
insects
now
appear
upon
the
scene
or
if
they
do
not
appear
for
even
with
the
best
of
glasses
such
are
mostly
invisible
it
is
evident
from
the
actions
of
the
birds
that
they
are
there
chase
after
chase
is
witnessed
all
made
in
the
same
manner
with
sometimes
a
jump
into
the
air
at
the
end
and
a
snap
that
one
seems
almost
to
hear
a
last
effort
but
which
judging
by
the
bird
demeanour
afterwards
fails
as
last
efforts
usually
do
a
social
feeling
seems
to
pervade
these
a
sort
of
have
got
one
have
that
bird
over
there
caught
two
idea
this
may
be
imaginary
still
the
whole
scene
with
its
various
little
incidents
suggests
it
to
one
the
therefore
besides
his
more
ordinary
food
of
worms
slugs
and
the
like
i
have
seen
him
in
company
with
peewits
searching
for
worms
much
as
do
thrushes
on
the
lawn
is
likewise
a
runner
down
and
snapper
up
of
such
unconsidered
trifles
as
moths
and
other
insects
on
the
wing
i
had
seen
him
chasing
them
indeed
long
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
for
i
had
connected
those
sudden
racing
runs
seen
before
from
a
long
distance
with
something
or
other
on
the
ground
imagining
a
fresh
object
for
each
run
often
had
i
wondered
first
at
the
eyesight
of
the
bird
which
seemed
to
pierce
the
mystery
of
a
worm
or
beetle
at
fifty
or
sixty
yards
distance
and
then
at
its
apparent
want
of
interest
each
time
it
got
to
the
place
where
it
seemed
to
have
located
it
really
it
had
but
just
lost
sight
of
what
it
was
pursuing
but
aerial
game
had
not
occurred
to
me
and
the
spring
into
the
air
which
would
have
explained
all
had
been
absent
on
these
occasions
i
have
called
such
leaps
last
efforts
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
if
they
are
always
the
last
more
than
once
i
have
thought
i
have
seen
a
rise
into
the
air
from
running
after
an
insect
and
continue
the
pursuit
on
the
wing
this
is
a
point
which
i
would
not
press
yet
birds
often
act
out
of
their
usual
habits
and
assume
those
proper
to
other
species
i
remember
once
towards
the
close
of
a
fine
afternoon
when
the
air
was
peopled
by
a
number
of
minute
insects
and
the
had
been
more
than
usually
active
in
their
chasings
a
large
flock
of
starlings
came
down
upon
the
warrens
and
began
to
behave
much
as
they
were
doing
running
excitedly
about
in
the
same
manner
and
evidently
with
the
same
object
but
what
interested
me
especially
was
that
they
frequently
rose
into
the
air
pursuing
and
as
i
feel
sure
often
catching
the
game
there
turning
and
twisting
about
like
though
with
less
graceful
movements
often
too
whilst
flying
fairly
high
from
one
part
of
the
warrens
to
another
they
would
deflect
their
course
in
order
to
catch
an
insect
or
two
i
observed
this
latter
action
first
and
doubted
the
motive
though
it
was
strongly
suggested
after
seeing
the
quite
unmistakable
actions
i
felt
more
assured
as
to
the
other
yet
one
may
watch
starlings
for
weeks
without
seeing
them
pursue
an
insect
in
the
air
their
usual
manner
of
feeding
is
widely
different
viz
by
repeatedly
probing
and
searching
the
ground
with
their
sharp
bills
as
does
a
snipe
with
which
bird
they
will
sometimes
feed
side
by
side
with
his
longer
and
more
delicate
one
this
is
well
seen
whilst
watching
them
on
a
lawn
they
do
not
study
to
find
worms
lying
in
the
holes
and
then
seize
them
suddenly
as
do
thrushes
and
blackbirds
with
them
it
is
blind
hookey
each
time
the
beak
is
thrust
down
into
the
grass
it
may
find
something
or
it
may
not
the
mandibles
are
all
the
time
working
against
each
other
evidently
searching
and
biting
at
the
roots
of
the
grass
and
at
intervals
but
generally
somewhat
long
ones
they
will
be
withdrawn
holding
within
their
grasp
a
large
greyish
grub
returning
to
the
during
the
day
as
i
have
said
these
birds
are
idle
and
lethargic
sitting
about
dozing
often
or
sleeping
but
as
the
air
cools
and
the
shadows
fall
they
rouse
into
a
glad
activity
and
coming
down
and
spreading
themselves
over
the
wide
space
of
the
warrens
they
begin
to
run
excitedly
about
raising
and
waving
their
wings
leaping
into
the
air
and
often
making
little
flights
or
rather
flittings
over
the
ground
as
a
part
of
the
disport
as
a
part
of
it
i
say
advisedly
for
they
do
not
stop
and
then
fly
and
on
alighting
recommence
but
the
flight
arises
out
of
the
wild
waving
and
running
and
this
is
resumed
without
a
pause
as
the
bird
again
touches
the
ground
all
about
now
over
the
warrens
their
plaintive
wailing
notes
are
heard
notes
that
seem
a
part
of
the
deepening
gloom
and
sad
sky
for
nature
own
sadness
seems
to
speak
in
the
voice
of
these
birds
they
swell
and
subside
and
swell
again
as
they
are
caught
up
and
repeated
in
different
places
from
one
bird
to
another
and
often
swell
into
a
full
chorus
of
several
together
deeper
now
fall
the
shadows
light
thickens
till
one
catches
at
last
only
dreary
gleams
about
the
moorland
as
now
here
now
there
the
wings
are
flung
up
showing
the
lighter
coloured
inner
surface
till
gradually
first
one
and
then
another
or
by
twos
or
threes
or
fours
the
birds
fly
off
into
the
night
wailing
as
they
go
but
this
note
on
the
wing
is
not
the
same
as
that
uttered
whilst
running
over
the
ground
the
is
much
more
drawn
out
and
a
sort
of
long
wailing
twitter
called
the
clamour
often
precedes
and
leads
up
to
the
final
wail
in
the
air
it
comes
just
as
a
wail
without
this
preliminary
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
the
birds
perform
these
antics
simultaneously
if
they
did
the
effect
would
be
more
striking
but
it
is
generally
only
a
few
at
a
time
over
a
wide
space
or
at
most
some
two
or
three
together
as
by
sympathy
that
act
so
the
eye
does
not
catch
more
than
a
few
gleams
some
three
or
four
or
five
of
the
wings
at
one
time
over
the
whole
space
it
is
a
gleam
here
and
a
gleam
there
in
the
deepening
gloom
dreary
gleams
about
the
moorland
for
warren
here
purples
into
moor
and
moor
saddens
into
warren
is
indeed
a
line
that
exactly
describes
the
effect
these
birds
then
stand
or
sit
about
during
the
day
in
their
chosen
places
of
assemblage
and
if
not
occupied
in
catching
insects
or
preening
themselves
they
are
dull
and
listless
but
as
the
evening
falls
and
the
air
cools
they
cast
off
their
lassitude
think
of
the
joys
of
the
night
there
is
dance
and
song
for
a
little
and
then
forth
they
fly
sad
and
wailing
as
are
their
notes
to
our
ears
they
are
no
doubt
anything
but
so
to
the
birds
themselves
and
as
the
accompaniment
of
what
seems
best
described
by
the
word
dance
may
perhaps
fairly
be
called
song
the
chants
of
some
savages
whilst
dancing
might
sound
almost
as
sadly
to
us
pitched
as
they
would
be
in
a
minor
key
and
with
little
which
we
would
call
an
air
again
if
one
goes
by
the
bird
probable
feelings
which
may
not
be
so
dissimilar
to
the
savage
or
indeed
to
our
own
on
similar
occasions
song
and
dance
seems
to
be
a
legitimate
use
of
words
but
whatever
anyone
may
feel
inclined
to
call
this
performance
dance
or
antics
or
display
it
varies
very
much
in
quality
being
sometimes
so
poor
that
it
is
difficult
to
use
words
about
it
without
seeming
to
exaggerate
and
at
other
times
so
fine
and
animated
that
were
the
birds
as
large
as
ostriches
or
even
as
the
great
bustard
much
would
be
said
and
written
on
the
subject
moreover
so
many
variations
and
novelties
and
little
personal
incidents
are
to
be
noticed
on
the
different
occasions
that
any
general
description
must
want
something
i
will
therefore
give
a
particular
one
of
what
i
witnessed
one
afternoon
when
the
dancing
was
especially
good
it
was
about
when
i
got
to
the
edge
of
the
bracken
which
to
some
extent
rings
round
the
birds
place
of
assembly
a
drizzling
rain
soon
began
and
this
increased
gradually
but
not
beyond
a
smart
drizzle
the
birds
as
though
stimulated
by
the
drops
now
began
to
come
down
from
where
they
had
been
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
amphitheatre
and
to
spread
all
over
it
till
there
were
numbers
of
them
and
dancing
of
a
more
pronounced
or
at
least
of
a
more
violent
kind
than
i
had
yet
seen
commenced
otherwise
it
was
quite
the
same
but
the
extra
degree
of
excitement
made
it
much
more
interesting
it
was
in
fact
remarkable
and
extraordinary
running
forward
with
wings
extended
and
slightly
raised
a
bird
would
suddenly
fling
them
high
up
and
then
as
it
were
about
over
the
ground
waving
and
tossing
them
stopping
short
turning
pitching
forward
again
leaping
into
the
air
descending
and
continuing
till
with
another
leap
it
would
make
a
short
eccentric
flight
low
over
the
ground
coming
down
in
a
sharp
curve
and
then
at
once
i
talk
of
their
about
because
their
movements
seemed
at
times
hardly
under
control
and
each
violent
run
or
plunge
ending
in
fact
with
a
sudden
pitch
forward
of
the
body
the
wings
straggling
about
often
pointed
forward
over
the
head
in
an
uncouth
dislocated
sort
of
way
the
effect
was
as
if
the
birds
were
being
blown
about
over
the
ground
in
a
violent
wind
they
seemed
in
fact
to
be
crazy
and
their
sudden
and
abrupt
return
after
a
few
mad
moments
to
propriety
and
decorum
had
a
curious
a
bizarre
effect
though
having
just
seen
them
behave
so
one
seemed
almost
to
doubt
that
they
had
one
bird
that
had
come
to
within
a
moderate
distance
of
me
made
three
little
runs
advancing
retiring
and
again
advancing
all
the
time
with
wings
upraised
and
waving
then
took
a
short
flight
over
the
ground
describing
the
segment
of
a
circle
and
on
alighting
continued
as
before
others
were
gathered
together
under
a
solitary
tree
a
rose
in
the
desert
less
than
yards
off
and
both
with
the
naked
eye
and
the
glasses
i
observed
them
all
thoroughly
well
one
of
them
would
often
run
at
or
pursue
another
with
these
antics
i
saw
one
that
was
standing
quietly
caught
and
as
it
were
covered
up
in
a
little
storm
of
wings
before
it
could
run
away
and
begin
waving
its
own
illustration
of
great
plovers
in
this
and
the
general
behaviour
of
the
group
makes
it
evident
that
the
birds
are
stimulated
in
their
by
each
other
presence
for
these
little
chases
were
in
sport
clearly
not
anger
very
different
is
the
action
and
demeanour
of
two
birds
about
to
fight
this
is
by
far
the
finest
display
of
the
sort
that
i
have
yet
seen
and
must
be
due
i
think
to
the
rain
which
the
birds
obviously
enjoyed
they
had
been
quite
dull
and
listless
before
but
as
soon
as
it
fell
they
spread
themselves
over
the
plateau
and
the
dancing
began
it
was
not
only
when
the
birds
threw
up
their
wings
and
as
one
may
say
let
themselves
go
that
they
seemed
excited
the
constant
quick
running
and
stopping
whilst
the
wings
were
folded
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
part
the
less
excited
part
of
the
general
emotion
out
of
which
the
sudden
frenzies
arose
there
was
also
the
usual
vocal
accompaniment
the
wailing
note
went
up
and
was
caught
and
repeated
from
one
part
to
another
at
greater
or
lesser
intervals
the
whole
ending
in
flight
as
before
when
i
first
saw
these
dances
i
thought
that
they
arose
out
of
the
excitement
of
the
chase
that
chase
of
moths
or
other
insects
flying
low
over
the
ground
which
i
have
noticed
that
they
were
in
fact
i
thought
the
motions
of
the
wings
were
to
beat
down
the
escaping
quarry
and
i
confounded
the
little
springs
and
leaps
into
the
air
arising
out
of
the
dance
and
being
a
part
of
it
with
those
other
ones
made
with
a
snap
and
an
object
not
to
be
mistaken
but
i
soon
discovered
my
error
is
only
indulged
in
occasionally
when
a
wandering
moth
or
so
happens
to
fly
by
the
general
hunt
which
i
have
described
was
incident
i
think
to
an
unusually
large
number
of
insects
in
the
air
over
the
warrens
by
which
not
only
a
band
of
starlings
as
before
mentioned
was
attracted
but
afterwards
swallows
and
martins
on
such
occasions
dancing
might
conceivably
grow
out
of
the
excitement
of
the
chase
so
as
to
appear
a
part
of
it
but
though
the
two
forms
of
excitement
may
sometimes
intermingle
the
tendency
would
probably
be
for
the
one
to
diminish
and
interfere
with
the
other
at
any
rate
almost
every
dance
which
i
have
witnessed
has
been
a
dance
pure
and
simple
what
then
is
the
meaning
of
this
dancing
of
these
strange
little
sudden
gusts
of
excitement
arising
each
day
at
about
the
same
time
and
lasting
till
the
birds
fly
away
we
have
here
a
social
display
as
distinct
from
a
nuptial
or
sexual
one
for
it
is
in
the
autumn
that
these
assemblages
of
the
great
plovers
take
place
after
the
breeding
is
all
over
the
deportment
of
the
courting
or
paired
birds
towards
each
other
their
nuptial
antics
is
of
a
different
character
with
birds
as
with
men
all
outward
action
must
be
the
outcome
of
some
mental
state
what
kind
of
mental
excitement
is
it
which
causes
the
to
behave
every
evening
in
this
mad
frantic
way
i
believe
that
it
is
one
of
expectancy
and
making
ready
that
these
odd
antics
the
mad
running
and
leaping
and
waving
of
the
wings
give
expression
to
the
anticipation
of
going
and
desire
to
be
gone
which
begins
to
possess
the
birds
as
evening
falls
they
are
the
prelude
to
and
they
end
in
flight
the
two
in
fact
merge
into
each
other
for
short
flights
grow
out
of
the
tumblings
over
the
ground
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
when
one
of
these
may
not
be
continued
into
the
full
flight
of
departure
they
are
a
part
of
the
dance
and
as
such
the
birds
may
almost
be
said
to
dance
off
surely
in
actions
which
lead
directly
up
to
any
event
there
must
be
an
idea
an
anticipation
of
it
nor
can
the
idea
of
departure
exist
in
a
bird
mind
hardly
perhaps
in
a
man
except
in
connection
with
what
it
is
departing
for
food
namely
in
this
case
a
banquet
so
when
i
say
that
these
birds
think
of
the
joys
of
the
night
need
this
be
merely
a
figure
may
it
not
be
true
that
they
do
so
and
dance
forth
each
night
to
their
joy
i
have
said
that
the
social
or
autumn
antics
of
the
their
dances
as
i
have
called
them
using
the
usual
phraseology
are
distinct
from
the
nuptial
or
courting
ones
which
they
indulge
in
in
the
spring
these
latter
are
of
a
different
character
altogether
but
much
more
interesting
to
see
than
they
are
easy
to
describe
the
birds
are
now
paired
or
in
process
of
becoming
so
and
it
is
fashionable
for
two
of
them
to
walk
side
by
side
and
very
close
together
with
little
gingerly
steps
as
though
keeping
company
they
seem
very
much
with
each
other
as
the
germans
would
say
also
to
have
a
mutual
sense
of
their
own
and
each
other
importance
of
the
seemly
and
becoming
nature
of
what
they
are
doing
and
this
above
all
of
the
great
value
of
deportment
something
there
is
about
them
now
even
more
than
at
other
times
very
odd
quaint
the
last
best
describes
it
they
are
birds
were
the
world
occupied
in
watching
them
and
were
they
occasionally
to
themselves
being
talked
about
they
would
catch
that
word
as
often
as
did
little
paul
dombey
whilst
watching
a
couple
walking
side
by
side
in
this
way
that
i
have
described
one
of
them
may
be
seen
to
bend
stiffly
forward
till
the
beak
just
touches
the
ground
the
tail
and
after
part
of
the
body
being
elevated
in
the
air
the
other
stands
by
and
appears
both
interested
in
and
edified
by
the
performance
and
when
it
is
over
both
walk
on
as
before
or
a
bird
may
be
seen
to
act
thus
whilst
walking
alone
upon
which
another
will
come
running
from
some
distance
towards
it
as
though
answering
to
a
summons
or
to
some
quite
irresistible
form
of
appeal
upon
coming
close
up
to
the
rigid
bird
this
other
one
stops
and
turning
suddenly
but
also
setly
and
rigidly
round
makes
a
curious
little
run
away
from
it
with
lowered
head
and
precise
formal
steps
full
of
a
peculiar
gravity
and
importance
having
thus
played
his
part
he
again
stops
and
standing
idly
about
seems
lapsed
into
indifference
meanwhile
the
rigid
one
having
remained
in
its
set
attitude
for
some
little
time
longer
at
length
comes
out
of
it
and
advancing
with
the
same
little
picked
careful
gingerly
steps
that
i
have
noticed
before
long
assumes
it
again
and
then
relaxing
crouches
low
on
the
ground
as
though
incubating
having
remained
thus
for
a
minute
or
two
it
rises
and
stands
at
ease
a
third
bird
now
appears
upon
the
scene
for
this
i
must
say
was
a
little
witnessed
drama
advancing
towards
the
two
as
he
approaches
one
of
them
the
one
which
has
run
up
in
response
to
the
appeal
and
which
i
take
to
be
the
male
becomes
uneasy
as
recognising
a
rival
he
first
either
runs
or
walks
the
pace
though
it
may
be
quick
is
solemn
to
the
female
and
makes
her
some
kind
of
bow
or
obeisance
of
a
very
formal
nature
then
straightening
and
turning
he
instantly
becomes
a
different
bird
so
changed
is
his
appearance
he
is
now
drawn
up
to
his
full
height
with
the
head
thrown
a
little
back
the
tail
is
fanned
out
into
the
shape
of
a
looking
very
pretty
the
broad
rounded
end
of
which
just
touches
the
ground
at
the
centre
and
thus
as
it
were
for
action
he
advances
upon
the
intruding
bird
with
quick
little
stilty
steps
prepared
evidently
to
do
battle
the
rival
however
retreats
before
this
display
and
the
accepted
suitor
having
followed
him
thus
for
some
little
way
not
rushing
upon
him
or
forcing
a
combat
but
more
as
gravely
and
seriously
prepared
for
one
turns
and
with
his
former
formal
pace
goes
back
to
his
hen
or
shall
we
not
rather
say
to
his
dulcinea
del
toboso
for
never
does
this
strange
gaunt
solemn
bird
with
the
tall
figure
and
the
strain
of
madness
in
the
great
glaring
eyes
more
remind
one
fancifully
of
cervantes
creation
than
now
surely
in
that
formal
approach
and
deep
reverence
to
his
mistress
before
entering
upon
this
perhaps
his
first
emprise
we
have
the
very

plovers
a
nuptial
in
the
above
case
it
was
presumably
the
female
bird
who
assumed
the
curious
rigid
attitude
with
the
tail
raised
and
head
stooped
forward
to
the
ground
the
attitude
however
assumed
by
the
male
which
i
have
described
as
a
bow
or
obeisance
and
indeed
it
has
this
appearance
was
much
of
the
same
nature
if
it
was
not
precisely
the
same
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
none
of
the
many
and
very
singular
attitudes
and
posturings
in
which
these
birds
indulge
are
peculiar
to
either
sex
at
any
rate
that
one
which
would
seem
to
appertain
to
courtship
or
matrimony
and
which
is
often
as
it
was
in
the
instance
i
am
about
to
give
immediately
followed
by
the
actual
pairing
of
the
birds
is
common
to
both
the
male
and
the
female
the
following
will
show
this
a
bird
which
has
for
some
time
been
sitting
now
rises
and
shakes
itself
a
little
presenting
as
it
does
so
a
very
and
appearance
for
which
adjectives
with
descriptive
plate
see
the
it
then
begins
uttering
that
long
thin
sound
which
goes
so
far
and
pierces
the
ear
so
pleasantly
this
is
answered
by
a
similar
cry
quite
near
and
i
now
see
for
the
first
time
another
bird
advancing
quickly
to
the
calling
one
who
also
advances
to
meet
it
they
approach
each
other
and
standing
side
by
side
with
perhaps
a
foot
between
them
but
looking
different
ways
each
in
the
direction
in
which
it
has
been
advancing
both
of
them
assume
at
the
same
time
a
particular
and
very
curious
posture
worth
waiting
days
to
see
first
they
draw
themselves
up
on
their
long
yellow
legs
then
curving
the
neck
with
a
slow
and
formal
motion
they
bend
the
head
downwards
yet
still
holding
it
at
a
height
and
stop
thus
set
and
rigid
the
beak
pointing
to
the
ground
having
stood
like
this
for
some
seconds
they
assume
the
normal
attitude
this
wonderful
pose
conceived
and
made
in
a
vein
of
stiff
formality
but
to
which
the
great
glaring
yellow
eye
gives
a
look
of
wildness
almost
of
insanity
has
in
it
both
during
its
development
and
when
its
acme
has
been
reached
something
quite
and
in
vain
to
describe
but
again
one
is
reminded
of
what
is
past
and
of
chivalry
and
of
scutcheons
and
heraldic
devices
of
don
quixote
and
the
baron
of
bradwardine
it
is
not
only
when
two
birds
are
by
themselves
that
these
or
other
attitudes
are
assumed
they
will
often
break
out
so
to
speak
amongst
three
or
four
birds
running
or
chasing
each
other
about
all
at
once
one
will
stop
stiffen
into
one
of
them
that
especially
where
the
head
is
lowered
till
the
beak
touches
or
nearly
touches
the
ground
and
remain
so
for
a
formal
period
but
all
such
runnings
and
chasings
are
at
this
time
but
a
part
of
the
business
of
pairing
and
one
divines
at
once
that
such
attitudes
are
of
a
sexual
character
the
above
are
a
few
of
the
gestures
or
antics
of
the
great
plover
or
during
the
spring
i
have
seen
others
but
either
they
were
less
salient
or
owing
to
the
great
distance
i
was
not
able
to
taste
them
properly
for
which
reason
and
on
account
of
space
i
will
not
further
dwell
upon
them
what
i
would
again
draw
attention
to
as
being
perhaps
of
interest
is
that
here
we
have
a
bird
with
distinct
nuptial
sexual
and
social
forms
of
display
or
antics
and
that
the
former
as
well
as
the
latter
are
equally
indulged
in
by
both
sexes

etc
the
pretty
little
belongs
properly
to
the
but
he
haunts
and
breeds
inland
also
and
is
especially
the
companion
of
the
over
the
stony
sandy
wastes
that
they
both
love
so
well
these
little
birds
have
both
a
nuptial
flight
and
a
courting
action
on
the
ground
in
the
former
a
pair
will
keep
crossing
and
recrossing
as
they
scud
about
or
they
will
sweep
towards
and
then
away
from
each
other
in
the
softest
and
prettiest
manner
imaginable
or
each
will
sweep
first
up
to
a
height
and
then
swiftly
down
again
and
skim
quite
low
along
the
ground
thus
delighting
the
eye
with
the
contrast
their
flight
is
all
in
graceful
sweeps
for
even
when
they
beat
the
air
with
their
slender
pointed
pinions
it
is
rather
as
though
they
kissed
than
beat
it
and
they
seem
all
the
while
to
be
sweeping
on
without
effort
so
soft
is
their
motion
another
salient
feature
is
the
varied
direction
of
their
flight
for
though
this
is
in
wide
spacious
circles
around
their
chosen
home
yet
within
this
free
limit
they
set
their
sails
to
all
points
of
the
compass
veering
from
one
to
another
with
so
joyous
a
motion
each
change
seems
an
ecstasy
as
indeed
it
is
to
behold
their
mode
of
alighting
on
the
ground
after
flight
is
very
pretty
for
they
do
so
as
if
they
meant
to
continue
flying
sometimes
the
wings
are
still
raised
still
make
their
little
in
the
air
as
they
softly
stop
or
the
bird
will
hold
them
drooped
and
but
and
skim
like
this
just
above
the
ground
at
once
he
is
on
it
but
there
has
been
no
jerk
no
pause
he
has
been
smooth
in
abruptness
settling
suddenly
there
has
been
no
sudden
motion
these
things
are
as
magic
they
are
and
yet
they
can
not
be
it
is
a
contradiction
yet
it
has
taken
place
in
formal
courtship
on
the
ground
the
male
approaches
the
female
with
head
and
neck
drawn
up
above
the
usual
height
so
that
he
presents
for
her
consideration
a
broader
and
fuller
frontage
of
throat
and
breast
than
upon
ordinary
occasions
he
does
not
raise
or
otherwise
disport
with
his
wings
but
through
the
glasses
one
can
see
that
his
little
legs
which
now
that
he
is
more
upright
are
less
invisible
are
being
moved
in
a
rapid
vibratory
manner
whilst
he
himself
seems
to
be
trembling
quivering
with
excitement
the
motion
of
the
legs
does
not
belong
to
the
gait
for
the
bird
stands
still
whilst
making
it
and
then
advances
a
few
steps
at
a
time
with
little
pauses
between
each
advance
during
which
the
legs
are
quivered
the
legs
of
the
ringed
plover
are
of
a
fine
orange
colour
and
the
male
drawing
himself
up
so
as
to
display
them
more
fully
and
then
moving
them
quickly
in
this
way
before
the
female
suggests
that
they
are
appreciated
by
her
but
it
is
not
only
the
legs
that
are
thus
well
exhibited
by
drawing
up
the
head
the
throat
in
which
soft
pure
white
and
velvet
black
are
boldly
and
richly
contrasted
as
well
as
the
little
smudged
pug
face
and
the
bright
bill
are
all
shown
off
to
advantage
the
wings
however
in
the
instance
which
i
observed
and
noted
at
the
time
were
kept
closed
i
can
hardly
think
this
is
always
the
case
if
it
is
it
may
be
because
though
pretty
enough
indeed
lovely
to
an
appreciative
human
eye
they
yet
do
not
in
their
colouring
present
anything
like
so
bold
and
salient
an
appearance
as
the
parts
mentioned
with
the
display
of
which
they
might
perhaps
interfere
though
i
confess
i
do
not
think
they
would
with
the
redshank
this
is
different
for
the
redshank
when
standing
with
wings
folded
is
a
very
bird
the
whole
of
the
upper
surface
being
of
a
drabby
brown
colour
and
the
under
parts
not
being
seen
to
advantage
but
as
he
rises
in
flight
all
is
changed
for
the
inner
surface
of
his
wings
with
in
a
less
degree
the
whole
under
part
of
his
body
are
of
a
delicate
soft
silky
white
looking
silvery
almost
as
the
light
falls
upon
it
and
causes
it
to
gleam
this
with
an
upper
of
bolder
white
on
the
wings
which
when
they
are
closed
is
concealed
now
catches
the
eye
and
the
bird
passes
from
insignificance
into
something
almost
distinguished
like
a
homely
face
flashing
into
beauty
by
virtue
of
a
smile
and
fine
eyes
now
the
male
redshank
when
courting
the
female
makes
the
most
of
his
wings
whilst
at
the
same
time
moving
his
legs
which
are
coloured
as
his
name
implies
in
the
same
manner
as
does
the
ringed
plover
he
did
so
at
any
rate
in
the
following
instance
the
male
bird
walking
up
to
the
female
raises
his
wings
gracefully
above
his
back
they
are
considerably
elevated
and
for
a
little
he
holds
them
thus
aloft
merely
but
soon
drooping
them
to
about
half
their
former
elevation
he
flutters
them
tremulously
and
gracefully
as
though
to
please
her
she
however
turned
from
him
walks
on
appearing
to
be
busy
in
feeding
the
male
takes
or
affects
to
take
little
notice
of
this
repulse
he
pecks
about
as
feeding
too
but
in
a
moment
or
so
walks
up
to
the
hen
again
and
now
raising
his
wings
to
the
fluttering
height
only
flutters
them
tremulously
as
before
she
walks
on
a
few
steps
and
stops
he
again
approaches
and
standing
beside
her
both
being
turned
the
same
way
with
his
head
and
neck
as
it
were
curved
over
her
again
trembles
his
wings
at
the
same
time
making
a
little
rapid
motion
with
his
red
legs
on
the
ground
as
though
he
were
walking
fast
yet
not
advancing
now
here
and
this
if
i
remember
was
the
case
with
the
ringed
plovers
also
the
female
did
not
appear
to
take
much
notice
of
the
male
bird
behaviour
she
was
turned
away
and
for
some
time
feeding
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
eyes
of
most
birds
are
not
set
frontally
in
the
head
as
are
ours
but
on
each
side
of
it
so
that
their
range
of
clear
vision
must
be
very
much
wider
probably
including
all
parts
except
directly
behind
them
they
also
turn
the
head
about
with
the
greatest
ease
and
the
slightest
turn
must
be
very
effective
they
would
therefore
often
see
quite
plainly
whilst
appearing
to
us
not
to
be
noticing
and
that
the
female
should
get
the
general
effect
of
the
male
display
is
all
that
is
required
by
the
theory
of
sexual
selection
as
conceived
by
darwin
darwin
has
expressly
said
that
he
does
not
imagine
that
the
female
birds
consciously
pick
out
the
most
adorned
or
males
but
only
that
such
males
have
a
more
exciting
effect
upon
them
which
leads
practically
to
their
being
selected
but
though
he
has
said
this
it
seems
hardly
ever
to
be
remembered
by
the
opponents
of
his
view
who
in
combating
it
almost
always
raise
a
picture
of
birds
critically
observing
patterns
and
colours
as
we
might
stuffs
in
a
shop
however
having
regard
to
the
and
especially
that
species
which
makes
an
actual
flower
garden
even
this
does
not
seem
so
absolutely
impossible
the
fact
is
we
are
too
conceited
with
regard
to
the
female
bird
sometimes
as
here
keeping
turned
from
the
male
while
thus
courted
by
him
this
is
i
think
capable
of
explanation
in
a
way
not
hostile
but
favourable
to
the
theory
of
sexual
selection
at
any
rate
in
both
these
instances
faut
rendre
à
either
was
or
seemed
to
be
the
final
conclusion
of
the
female
as
the
nuptial
season
approaches
the
peewits
begin
to
stand
singly
or
in
pairs
about
the
low
marshy
land
or
to
fly
over
it
is
their
cry
far
more
to
my
ear
resembling
this
than
the
sound
or
as
imitated
in
their
name
at
intervals
one
or
another
of
them
will
make
its
peculiar
throw
or
somersault
in
the
air
this
in
its
completest
form
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
behold
though
so
familiar
that
no
attention
is
paid
to
it
the
bird
in
full
flight
in
a
rushing
torrent
of
sound
and
motion
may
be
seen
to
partially
close
the
wings
and
fall
plumb
as
though
it
had
been
shot
in
a
moment
or
two
but
often
not
before
there
has
been
a
considerable
drop
the
wings
are
again
partially
extended
and
the
bird
turns
right
head
over
heels
then
sweeping
buoyantly
upwards
sometimes
almost
from
the
ground
it
continues
its
flight
as
before
such
a
tumble
as
this
is
a
fine
specimen
they
are
not
all
so
abrupt
and
dramatic
but
there
is
one
point
common
to
them
all
which
is
the
impossibility
of
saying
exactly
how
the
actual
somersault
is
thrown
do
these
tumblings
add
to
the
charm
of
the
peewit
flight
to
the
charm
perhaps
certainly
to
the
wonder
and
interest
but
hardly
unless
we
are
never
to
criticise
nature
to
the
grace
the
contrast
is
too
great
there
is
something
of
violence
almost
of
buffoonery
about
it
it
is
as
though
the
clown
came
tumbling
right
into
the
middle
of
the
transformation
scene
as
the
birds
sweep
about
they
begin
to
enter
into
their
bridal
dances
pursuing
each
other
with
devious
flight
pausing
hanging
stationary
with
flapping
wings
one
just
above
the
other
then
sweeping
widely
away
in
opposite
directions
shortly
afterwards
they
are
again
flying
side
by
side
or
the
sun
in
a
wintry
smile
catches
both
the
white
breasts
as
they
make
a
little
coquettish
dart
at
each
other
then
again
they
separate
and
again
the
joyous
flits
with
them
over
marsh
and
moor
sometimes
a
bird
will
come
flying
alone
somewhat
low
over
the
ground
in
a
hurrying
manner
very
fast
and
making
a
sound
with
the
wings
as
they
beat
the
air
which
is
almost
like
the
puffing
of
an
engine
indeed
one
may
easily
sometimes
imagine
a
train
in
the
distance
as
one
watches
him
thus
scudding
along
tilting
himself
as
ever
now
on
one
side
now
on
another
all
at
once
he
will
give
a
sharp
turn
as
if
about
to
make
one
of
his
wide
sweeping
circles
but
almost
instantly
he
again
reverses
and
sweeps
on
in
the
same
direction
as
before
this
trick
adds
very
much
to
the
appearance
if
not
to
the
reality
of
speed
for
the
smooth
swift
sweep
close
following
the
little
abrupt
twist
back
contrasts
with
it
and
seems
the
more
in
comparison
or
one
will
fly
in
quick
small
circles
several
times
repeated
a
little
above
the
spot
where
he
intends
to
alight
descending
at
last
in
the
very
centre
of
his
girdle
with
wonderful
buoyancy
a
hooded
crow
now
flies
over
the
marsh
and
is
pursued
by
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
peewits
there
is
little
combination
nor
does
there
seem
much
of
anger
it
is
more
like
a
sport
or
a
practical
joke
it
is
curious
that
the
crow
flight
has
taken
the
character
of
the
peewit
for
they
sweep
upwards
and
downwards
together
seeming
like
master
and
pupil
i
have
never
seen
a
crow
fly
so
uninfluenced
and
this
again
gives
an
amicable
appearance
i
have
seen
a
peewit
make
continual
sweeps
down
at
a
hen
pheasant
as
she
stood
in
a
striking
at
her
each
time
with
its
wings
in
the
air
obviously
not
in
play
but
in
earnest
the
pheasant
dodged
or
tried
to
dodge
each
time
and
this
lasted
some
while
here
it
seems
very
different
and
now
again
a
compact
little
flock
of
peewits
is
flying
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
river
with
a
hooded
crow
not
the
same
bird
but
another
right
amongst
them
this
continues
for
some
little
time
till
the
peewits
go
down
on
the
margin
and
the
crow
then
flies
into
a
tree
hard
by
after
a
little
interval
the
peewits
fly
off
again
and
almost
directly
the
crow
is
with
them
and
again
they
fly
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
water
for
some
time
as
before
and
again
i
note
and
this
time
it
is
still
more
marked
and
unmistakable
that
the
crow
is
flying
amongst
the
peewits
exactly
as
they
fly
at
least
he
is
speaking
french
with
them
after
ye
school
of
stratford
for
who
flies
like
a
peewit
a
peewit
but
he
sweeps
with
them
now
upwards
now
downwards
in
smooth
gliding
sweeps
a
curious
black
and
grey
patch
in
the
midst
of
their
gleaming
greens
and
whites
yet
he
is
a
handsome
bird
too
is
the
hooded
crow
but
not
when
he
flies
with
peewits
now
the
peewits
again
go
down
and
the
crow
straightway
flies
into
another
tree
shortly
afterwards
a
feeding
on
the
grass
is
hustled
by
one
of
the
peewits
into
the
water
here
again
hostility
was
evident
whereas
with
the
crow
i
could
see
no
trace
of
it
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
whilst
the
peewits
on
their
part
showed
no
objection
to
his
company
illustration
and
pupil
flying
with
late
in
the
afternoon
there
is
a
pause
and
hush
the
birds
have
ceased
flying
till
dusk
and
are
either
standing
still
or
walking
over
the
ground
one
i
can
see
motionless
amidst
the
brown
tufted
grass
no
not
quite
motionless
ever
and
anon
there
comes
the
strained
grating
of
another
peewit
and
then
this
one
rears
up
the
body
and
jerks
the
head
a
little
back
then
jerks
it
flexibly
forward
again
at
first
he
does
this
in
silence
but
soon
answering
the
cry
you
see
the
thin
little
black
bill
divide
as
he
bobs
and
the
sound
comes
out
of
it
as
though
drawn
by
a
wire
so
roopy
and
raspy
is
it
now
he
can
contain
himself
no
longer
but
begins
to
walk
about
through
the
grass
making
a
devious
course
and
uttering
the
call
at
intervals
very
different
is
this
note
from
the
joyous
musical
still
it
is
in
harmony
with
nature
with
the
stillness
the
sadness
the
loneliness
this
standing
or
pacing
about
whilst
calling
roopily
and
as
it
were
in
a
stealthy
manner
to
each
other
should
be
a
very
prosaic
affair
one
would
think
for
a
pair
of
peewits
after
such
glorious
flying
but
no
doubt
there
is
some
excitement
in
it
perhaps
it
is
thought
a
little
fast
as
some
slow
things
with
us
are
and
hence
the
peculiar
charm
now
these
two
birds
are
standing
lazily
on
two
of
the
black
molehills
which
are
all
about
the
marshy
land
some
of
them
of
a
size
beyond
one
comprehension
and
making
the
cry
at
intervals
to
each
other
lazily
they
stand
lazily
they
utter
it
and
seem
as
though
they
had
taken
up
their
for
the
night
but
when
the
night
falls
they
will
be
hurrying
shadows
in
it
and
their
cries
will
come
out
of
the
darkness
mingling
with
the
bleatings
of
the
snipe
there
is
a
sameness
and
yet
a
constant
difference
in
the
aerial
sports
and
evolutions
of
peewits
it
is
like
a
continual
variation
of
the
same
air
or
a
recurrent
thread
of
melody
winding
itself
through
a
labyrinth
of
notes
parts
of
the
melody
are
where
two
skim
low
over
the
ground
in
rapid
pursuit
of
each
other
one
settles
the
other
skims
on
then
makes
a
great
upward
sweep
turns
sweeps
down
and
back
again
again
rises
turns
and
sweeps
again
and
so
on
rising
and
falling
over
the
same
wide
space
with
the
regular
motions
and
long
rushing
swing
of
a
pendulum
each
time
it
comes
rushing
down
upon
the
bird
that
has
settled
and
each
time
at
the
right
moment
this
one
makes
a
little
ascension
towards
it
sometimes
floating
above
it
as
it
passes
sometimes
beneath
alighting
again
immediately
afterwards
this
may
continue
for
some
little
time
the
one
bird
passing
backwards
and
forwards
over
or
under
the
other
as
long
as
he
is
received
in
the
same
way
gradually
however
these
little
sorties
against
him
from
being
at
first
hardly
more
than
springs
with
aid
of
wings
become
more
and
more
prolonged
and
extended
outwards
into
his
own
radius
of
flight
the
bird
making
them
no
longer
alights
in
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
place
as
where
he
went
up
but
farther
and
farther
away
from
it
the
figure
is
lost
or
becomes
indistinct
as
water
is
in
water
till
at
last
the
two
are
flying
and
chasing
each
other
again
this
upward
sweep
from
near
the
ground
sometimes
from
nearly
touching
it
with
its
attendant
sweep
back
again
is
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
of
the
peewit
flight
a
flight
that
is
full
of
beauties
he
does
it
often
but
not
always
in
quite
the
same
way
it
is
a
varying
perfection
for
each
time
it
is
perfect
and
sometimes
it
seems
to
vie
with
almost
any
aerial
the
bird
wings
as
it
shoots
aloft
are
spread
half
open
and
remain
thus
without
being
moved
at
all
the
body
is
turned
sideways
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
and
the
light
glancing
on
the
pure
soft
white
of
the
under
part
makes
it
look
like
the
crest
of
foam
on
an
invisible
and
wave
as
the
uprush
attains
its
zenith
there
is
a
lovely
soft
effortless
curling
over
of
the
body
and
the
foam
sinks
again
with
the
wave
such
motions
are
not
flight
they
are
passive
abandonings
and
driftings
on
unseen
currents
and
feathered
eddies
in
the
thin
ocean
of
the
air
it
is
i
think
the
cessation
of
all
effort
on
the
bird
part
which
makes
the
great
loveliness
here
the
impetus
has
been
gained
in
flight
before
acres
of
moorland
away
sometimes
it
cometh
from
afar
the
upward
fall
the
delicious
crested
curl
and
soft
sinking
swoon
to
the
earth
are
all
rest
rhythmical
rest
another
curious
and
extremely
pretty
performance
a
familiar
bar
of
that
thread
of
melody
that
main
theme
of
the
movement
is
when
two
birds
one
just
a
little
behind
the
other
and
at
slightly
different
elevations
both
make
the
same
movements
in
quick
succession
the
bird
behind
mimicking
the
one
in
front
of
him
in
a
kind
of
aerial
does
the
one
pause
and
hang
on
extended
wings
that
rapidly
beat
the
air
the
other
does
so
too
does
it
sail
on
a
little
and
then
make
a
sideway
dive
it
is
imitated
in
the
same
way
and
thus
often
for
quite
a
little
while
the
two
will
understudy
each
other
for
each
i
think
may
alternately
become
the
leader
again
if
this
is
not
merely
a
development
of
the
above
two
of
them
will
hover
on
outstretched
wings
directly
over
and
almost
touching
each
other
sometimes
indeed
they
do
touch
for
the
bird
that
is
stretched
above
is
continually
trying
to
strike
down
on
the
other
one
with
his
wings
and
often
succeeds
by
making
a
sudden
little
drop
on
to
him
a
drop
which
is
only
of
an
inch
or
so
quite
covering
him
up
for
a
moment
then
disjoining
they
will
flap
along
for
some
while
still
close
together
flashing
out
alternately
dark
and
silver
as
if
showing
their
glints
to
each
other
till
in
two
dying
falls
they
sweep
apart
and
skim
the
ground
and
the
heavens
when
peewits
seem
thus
to
battle
together
with
their
wings
in
the
air
it
may
well
be
that
they
are
really
fighting
in
which
case
we
may
perhaps
assume
that
they
are
two
males
and
not
male
and
female
but
as
what
i
shall
have
to
say
with
regard
to
the
on
this
point
may
be
applied
to
the
peewit
and
as
i
have
better
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
former
bird
i
will
not
dwell
on
it
longer
here
but
the
question
arises
whether
in
many
other
cases
when
the
sporting
birds
would
seem
to
be
male
and
female
this
is
really
the
case
one
is
apt
to
think
so
at
first
but
when
one
sees
often
a
third
bird
associate
itself
with
a
pair
who
are
thus
behaving
and
join
for
a
little
in
their
antics
or
when
one
of
a
pair
desisting
and
alighting
on
the
ground
the
other
continues
to
sport
in
precisely
the
same
way
with
another
bird
or
when
again
the
supposed
lovers
become
two
of
a
small
flock
or
band
and
all
sport
thus
together
crossing
and
intermingling
till
they
again
separate
one
must
suppose
that
these
evolutions
though
they
may
be
mostly
of
a
nuptial
character
are
not
sexual
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
but
that
the
social
element
enters
more
or
less
largely
into
them
but
amongst
savages
there
are
i
believe
if
not
let
us
imagine
that
there
are
dances
the
theme
of
which
is
marriage
where
sometimes
men
sometimes
women
sometimes
men
and
women
dance
together
all
having
in
their
mind
the
primitive
ideas
suggested
by
that
great
institution
men
thinking
of
women
women
of
men
under
every
kind
of
grouping
one
may
suppose
it
to
be
thus
with
the
peewits
as
they
sport
with
one
another
in
the
air
during
the
nuptial
season
in
which
case
the
social
and
sexual
elements
would
be
a
changing
and
varying
factor
one
may
say
indeed
that
there
can
be
no
sexual
sport
or
play
into
which
the
social
element
does
not
also
and
necessarily
enter
this
is
no
doubt
true
strictly
speaking
but
the
latter
may
be
so
merged
in
the
former
that
practically
it
does
not
exist
some
of
the
peewits
nuptial
and
bizarreries
are
of
this
nature
but
as
they
are
peculiar
and
seem
to
stand
in
some
relation
to
another
great
class
of
avian
activities
i
shall
reserve
them
for
a
future
chapter
illustration
illustration
chapter
iii
watching
snipe
etc
i
have
alluded
to
the
aerial
combats
of
the
during
the
nuptial
season
as
elucidating
similar
movements
on
the
part
of
the
peewit
though
i
was
not
able
so
fully
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
in
the
latter
bird
the
fighting
of
birds
on
the
wing
has
sometimes
to
my
eye
at
least
a
very
soft
and
delicate
appearance
which
does
not
so
much
resemble
fighting
as
sport
and
dalliance
between
the
sexes
larks
for
instance
have
what
seem
at
the
worst
to
be
delicate
little
in
the
air
carried
on
in
a
way
which
suggests
this
sometimes
rising
together
they
keep
approaching
and
retiring
from
each
other
with
the
light
swinging
motion
of
a
shuttlecock
just
before
it
turns
over
to
descend
and
this
resemblance
is
increased
by
their
flying
perpendicularly
or
almost
so
with
their
heads
up
and
tails
down
indeed
they
seem
more
to
be
thrown
through
the
air
than
to
fly
then
in
one
fall
they
sink
together
into
the
grass
or
they
will
keep
mounting
above
and
above
each
other
to
some
height
and
then
descend
in
something
the
same
way
but
more
sweepingly
for
let
no
one
hope
to
see
exactly
how
they
do
it
seeming
to
make
with
their
bodies
the
soft
links
of
a
feathered
chain
or
as
though
their
own
linked
sweetness
of
song
had
been
translated
into
matter
and
motion
in
each
case
they
make
all
the
time
as
convenient
little
kissipecks
rather
than
pecks
at
each
other
again
in
the
case
of
the
redshank
though
i
have
little
doubt
now
that
the
following
which
was
both
aquatic
and
aerial
was
a
genuine
combat
between
two
males
yet
often
at
the
time
and
especially
in
its
preface
and
conclusion
it
seemed
as
though
the
birds
were
of
opposite
sexes
and
if
fighting
at
all
only
amorously
two
birds
are
pursuing
each
other
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
water
is
low
and
a
little
point
of
mud
and
shingle
projects
into
the
stream
up
and
down
this
from
the
herbage
to
the
water
edge
and
back
again
the
birds
run
one
close
behind
the
other
and
each
uttering
a
funny
little
piping
cry
it
is
one
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
always
pursues
the
other
who
after
a
time
flies
to
the
opposite
bank
the
pursuer
follows
and
the
chase
is
now
carried
on
by
a
series
of
little
flights
from
bank
to
bank
sometimes
straight
across
sometimes
slanting
a
little
up
or
down
the
stream
whilst
sometimes
there
is
a
little
flight
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
bank
in
the
intervals
of
crossing
this
continues
for
something
like
an
hour
but
at
last
the
pursuing
bird
as
both
fly
out
from
the
bank
makes
a
little
dart
and
overtaking
the
other
one
both
flutter
down
into
the
stream
they
rise
from
it
straight
up
into
the
air
like
two
blackbirds
fighting
then
fall
back
into
it
again
and
now
there
is
a
violent
struggle
in
the
water
whilst
it
lasts
the
birds
are
swimming
just
as
two
ducks
would
be
under
similar
circumstances
and
every
now
and
then
in
the
pauses
of
exhaustion
both
rest
floating
on
the
water
the
combat
would
be
as
purely
aquatic
as
with
coots
or
if
it
were
not
that
the
two
birds
often
struggle
out
of
the
water
and
rise
together
into
the
air
where
they
continue
the
struggle
each
one
rising
alternately
above
the
other
and
trying
to
push
it
down
it
would
seem
with
the
legs
these
were
the
tactics
adopted
in
the
water
too
but
yet
with
a
good
deal
of
motion
and
exertion
there
seems
but
little
of
fury
the
birds
are
not
or
at
least
they
do
not
seem
to
be
it
is
a
soft
sort
of
combat
and
now
it
has
ended
in
the
combatants
making
their
mutual
toilette
quite
close
to
one
another
one
stands
on
the
shore
and
preens
itself
the
other
sits
just
off
it
on
the
water
and
bathes
in
it
like
a
duck
even
here
owing
principally
to
the
friendly
i
was
not
quite
clear
as
to
the
nature
of
the
bird
actions
how
completely
i
at
first
mistook
it
in
the
case
of
the
with
the
way
in
which
it
was
afterwards
made
plain
to
me
the
following
will
show
most
interesting
aerial
nuptial
evolutions
of
the
male
and
female
they
navigate
the
air
together
following
each
other
in
the
closest
manner
one
being
almost
all
the
while
just
above
the
other
their
wings
seeming
to
pulsate
in
time
as
soldiers
if
sweet
birds
will
forgive
such
a
simile
keep
step
now
they
rise
now
sink
making
a
wide
irregular
circle
both
seem
to
wish
yet
not
to
wish
to
touch
almost
yet
not
quite
doing
so
till
when
very
close
the
upper
one
drops
lightly
towards
the
one
beneath
him
who
sinks
too
yet
for
a
moment
you
hear
the
wings
clap
against
each
other
this
sounds
faintly
though
very
perceptibly
but
the
distance
is
great
and
it
must
really
be
loud
every
now
and
again
the
wings
will
cease
to
vibrate
and
the
two
birds
sweep
through
the
air
on
spread
pinions
but
otherwise
in
the
manner
that
has
been
described
i
must
have
watched
this
continuing
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
they
sunk
to
the
ground
together
still
maintaining
the
same
relative
position
and
with
quivering
wings
as
before
here
however
something
distracted
me
the
glasses
lost
them
and
i
did
not
see
them
actually
alight
another
pair
rise
right
from
the
ground
in
this
manner
one
directly
above
the
other
quiver
upwards
to
some
little
height
then
sweep
off
on
spread
pinions
following
each
other
but
still
at
slightly
different
elevations
they
overtake
one
another
quiver
up
still
higher
with
hardly
an
inch
between
them
then
suddenly
with
an
as
it
were
of
this
sweep
apart
and
float
in
lovely
circles
now
upwards
now
downwards
as
they
do
this
another
bird
rushes
through
the
air
to
join
them
he
circles
too
all
three
are
circling
the
light
glinting
on
one
falling
from
another
thrown
and
caught
and
thrown
again
as
if
they
played
at
ball
with
light
but
i
did
not
see
what
they
were
doing
before
they
rose
i
thought
therefore
that
birds
when
they
flew
in
pairs
like
this
were
disporting
themselves
together
in
a
nuptial
flight
and
making
as
indeed
this
in
any
case
is
true
a
very
pretty
display
of
it
what
was
there
indeed
or
what
did
there
seem
to
be
to
indicate
that
angry
passions
lay
at
the
root
of
all
this
loveliness
but
i
had
not
taken
sufficiently
into
consideration
that
sharp
clap
of
the
wings
indicating
a
blow
a
severe
one
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
birds
with
a
parry
on
that
of
the
other
this
is
how
as
well
as
other
pigeons
fight
on
the
ground
and
it
is
as
an
outcome
and
continuation
of
these
fierce
combats
which
there
is
no
mistaking
that
the
contending
birds
rise
and
hover
one
over
the
other
in
the
manner
described
my
notes
will
i
think
show
this
as
well
as
the
curious
and
as
it
were
formal
manner
in
which
the
is
conducted
illustration
a
duel
with
two
this
is
very
interesting
and
peculiar
they
fight
with
continual
blows
of
the
wings
these
being
used
both
as
sword
or
rather
partisan
and
shield
the
peculiarity
however
is
this
that
every
now
and
again
there
is
a
pause
in
the
combat
when
both
birds
make
the
low
bow
with
tail
raised
in
air
as
in
courting
sometimes
both
will
bow
together
and
as
it
would
seem
to
each
other
facing
towards
each
other
at
any
rate
but
at
other
times
they
will
both
stand
in
a
line
and
bow
so
that
one
bows
only
to
the
tail
of
the
other
who
bows
to
the
empty
air
or
the
two
will
bow
at
different
times
each
seeming
more
concerned
in
making
his
bow
than
in
the
direction
or
bestowal
of
it
it
is
like
a
little
interlude
and
when
it
is
over
the
combatants
advance
again
against
each
other
till
they
stand
front
to
front
and
quite
close
both
then
make
a
little
jump
and
battle
vigorously
with
their
wings
striking
and
parrying
one
now
makes
a
higher
spring
trying
apparently
to
jump
on
to
his
opponent
back
and
then
strike
down
upon
him
this
is
all
plain
honest
fighting
but
there
is
a
constant
tendency
constantly
carried
out
for
the
two
to
get
into
line
and
fight
in
a
sort
of
fashion
whilst
making
these
low
bows
at
intervals
it
is
a
fight
encumbered
with
forms
with
a
heavy
punctilious
ceremony
reminding
one
of
those
ornate
sweeps
and
bowing
which
are
entered
into
before
and
at
each
pause
in
the
duel
between
hamlet
and
laertes
as
arranged
by
sir
henry
irving
at
the
lyceum
there
were
four
or
five
birds
together
when
this
fight
broke
out
but
i
could
not
feel
quite
sure
whether
the
ones
watched
the
fighting
of
the
other
two
if
they
did
i
do
not
think
they
were
at
all
keenly
interested
in
it
also
the
fighting
birds
may
sometimes
when
they
bowed
have
done
so
to
the
birds
that
stood
near
but
it
never
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
the
case
and
it
certainly
was
not
so
in
most
instances
in
the
spring
from
the
ground
which
one
of
the
fighting
birds
sometimes
makes
coming
down
on
the
other
one
back
and
striking
with
the
wings
we
have
perhaps
the
beginning
of
what
may
develop
into
a
contest
in
the
clouds
for
let
the
bird
that
is
undermost
also
spring
up
and
both
are
in
the
air
in
the
position
required
and
it
is
natural
that
the
undermost
should
continue
to
rise
because
it
could
more
easily
avoid
the
blows
of
the
other
whilst
in
the
air
by
sinking
down
through
it
than
it
could
on
the
ground
at
such
a
disadvantage
whether
in
the
following
instance
the
one
bird
jumped
on
to
the
other
back
does
not
appear
but
as
will
be
seen
the
flight
which
i
had
thought
to
be
of
a
sexual
and
nuptial
character
was
the
direct
outcome
of
a
scrimmage
a
short
fight
between
two
it
is
really
most
curious
there
is
a
blow
and
then
a
bow
then
a
vigorous
with
hard
blows
and
adroit
parries
a
pause
with
two
profound
bows
another
and
then
the
birds
rise
one
keeping
just
above
the
other
and
ascend
slowly
with
quickly
and
constantly
beating
wings
in
the
way
so
often
witnessed
it
would
appear
therefore
that
the
curious
flights
of
two
birds
up
into
the
air
the
one
of
them
exactly
over
and
almost
touching
the
other
wherein
as
i
have
noted
there
is
frequently
a
blow
with
the
wings
which
to
judge
by
the
sound
reaching
me
from
a
considerable
distance
must
be
sometimes
a
severe
one
are
the
aerial
continuations
of
combats
commenced
on
the
ground
sometimes
that
is
to
say
there
seems
no
reason
why
birds
accustomed
thus
to
contend
should
not
sometimes
do
so
and
without
any
preliminary
encounter
on
mother
earth
and
this
i
believe
is
the
case
here
then
in
the
we
have
at
the
nuptial
season
a
kind
of
flight
which
seems
certainly
to
be
of
the
nature
of
a
combat
very
much
resembling
that
of
the
peewit
at
the
same
season
i
have
seen
peewits
fighting
on
the
ground
and
once
they
were
for
a
moment
in
the
air
together
at
a
foot
or
two
above
it
and
the
one
a
little
above
the
other
this
however
may
have
been
mere
chance
and
i
have
not
seen
the
one
form
of
combat
arise
unmistakably
out
of
the
other
as
in
the
case
of
the
but
assuming
that
in
each
case
there
is
a
combat
is
it
certain
that
the
contending
birds
are
always
or
generally
two
males
and
not
male
and
female
it
certainly
seems
natural
to
suppose
this
but
with
the
at
any
rate
and
i
believe
with
pigeons
generally
the
two
sexes
sometimes
fight
sharply
and
moreover
the
female
bows
to
the
male
as
well
as
the
male
to
the
female
both
which
points
will
be
brought
out
in
the
following
instances
a
hen
bird
is
sitting
alone
on
the
sand
a
male
flies
up
to
her
and
begins
bowing
she
does
not
respond
but
walks
away
and
on
being
followed
and
pressed
stands
and
strikes
at
her
annoyer
with
the
wings
and
there
is
then
a
short
fight
between
the
two
at
the
end
of
it
and
when
the
bowing
pigeon
has
been
driven
off
and
is
walking
away
having
his
tail
therefore
turned
to
the
one
he
is
leaving
this
one
also
bows
once
only
but
quite
unmistakably
the
bow
was
directed
towards
her
retiring
adversary
and
also
wooer
the
two
birds
therefore
standing
in
a
line
and
on
another
occasion
a
flies
to
another
sitting
on
the
warrens
and
bows
to
her
upon
which
she
also
bows
to
him
yet
his
addresses
are
not
successfully
urged
the
sexes
are
here
assumed
for
the
male
and
female
do
not
differ
sufficiently
for
one
to
distinguish
them
at
a
distance
through
the
glasses
when
however
one
sees
a
bird
fly
like
this
to
another
one
and
begin
the
regular
courting
action
one
seems
justified
in
assuming
it
to
be
a
male
and
the
other
a
female
both
however
bowed
and
there
was
a
fight
though
a
short
one
i
have
seen
others
of
longer
duration
between
them
it
becomes
therefore
a
question
whether
the
much
more
determined
fights
which
i
have
witnessed
are
not
also
between
the
male
and
the
female
and
not
between
two
males
if
so
the
origin
of
the
conflict
is
probably
in
all
such
cases
as
it
certainly
has
been
in
those
which
i
have
witnessed
the
desires
of
the
male
bird
to
which
he
tries
to
make
the
female
submit
that
she
in
the
very
midst
of
resisting
taken
as
it
would
seem
in
her
heart
extremest
hate
should
yet
bow
to
her
ravisher
seems
strange
but
she
certainly
does
so
whether
it
would
be
more
or
less
strange
that
two
male
birds
whilst
fiercely
contending
should
act
in
this
way
i
will
leave
to
my
readers
to
decide
and
thus
settle
the
nature
of
these
curious
ceremonious
encounters
and
their
graceful
and
interesting
aerial
continuations
to
their
own
satisfaction
with
this
suggestion
however
that
fighting
may
be
blended
with
sexual
display
in
the
combats
of
male
birds
owing
to
association
of
ideas
for
rivalry
is
the
main
cause
of
such
combats
however
it
may
be
the
bow
itself
which
i
will
now
notice
more
fully
is
certainly
of
a
nuptial
character
and
is
seen
in
its
greatest
perfection
only
when
the
male
courts
the
female
this
he
does
by
either
flying
or
walking
up
to
her
and
bowing
solemnly
till
his
breast
touches
the
ground
his
tail
going
up
at
the
same
time
to
an
even
more
than
corresponding
height
though
with
an
action
less
solemn
the
tail
in
its
ascent
is
beautifully
fanned
but
it
is
not
spread
out
flat
like
a
fan
but
arched
which
adds
to
the
beauty
of
its
appearance
as
it
is
brought
down
it
closes
again
but
should
the
bow
be
followed
up
it
is
instantly
again
fanned
out
and
sweeps
the
ground
as
its
owner
now
risen
from
his
prostrate
attitude
with
head
erect
and
throat
swelled
makes
a
little
rush
towards
the
object
of
his
desires
the
preliminary
bow
however
is
more
usually
followed
by
another
or
by
two
or
three
others
each
one
being
a
distinct
and
separate
affair
the
bird
remaining
with
his
head
sunk
and
tail
raised
and
fanned
for
some
seconds
before
rising
to
repeat
thus
it
is
not
like
two
or
three
little
bobs
which
is
the
manner
of
wooing
pursued
by
the
but
there
is
one
set
bow
to
which
but
one
elevation
and
depression
of
the
tail
belongs
and
the
offerer
of
it
must
not
only
regain
his
normal
upright
attitude
but
remain
in
it
for
a
perceptible
period
before
making
another
this
bow
therefore
is
of
the
most
impressive
and
even
solemn
nature
and
expresses
as
much
as
anything
in
dumb
show
can
express
madam
i
am
your
most
devoted
i
believe
but
i
am
not
sure
and
quite
ready
to
be
corrected
that
the
bow
is
either
a
silent
one
or
at
least
that
the
note
uttered
is
subdued
the
latter
seems
the
more
probable
at
any
rate
i
was
never
able
to
catch
it
either
when
watching
on
the
warrens
at
a
greater
or
less
distance
or
when
not
so
far
amongst
trees
for
the
woos
also
amongst
the
leafy
woods
as
does
the
of
which
it
is
a
smaller
replica
but
without
the
ring
the
male
when
courting
bows
to
the
female
lengthways
along
the
branch
on
which
he
is
sitting
elevating
his
tail
at
the
same
time
in
just
the
same
way
as
does
the
as
he
does
so
he
says
the
last
syllable
being
long
drawn
out
and
having
a
very
intense
expression
with
a
rise
in
the
tone
of
it
sometimes
almost
to
the
extent
of
becoming
a
soft
shrillness
having
delivered
himself
of
this
long
he
says
several
times
together
in
an
undertone
and
very
quickly
coo
coo
coo
or
coo
coo
coo
coo
coo
coo
after
which
rising
and
then
bowing
again
he
recommences
with
the
impassioned
as
before
all
this
he
repeats
several
times
the
number
probably
depending
on
whether
the
female
bird
stays
to
hear
his
addresses
or
as
is
usual
in
the
contrary
flies
away
if
she
admits
them
pairing
may
take
place
and
at
the
conclusion
of
it
both
birds
utter
a
peculiar
low
deep
and
very
raucous
note
which
i
have
heard
on
this
occasion
but
on
no
other
if
the
courting
of
the
female
by
the
male
whilst
on
the
ground
or
amongst
the
branches
of
a
tree
is
of
a
somewhat
heavy
nature
more
pompous
than
beautiful
as
is
i
think
the
case
it
is
lightened
in
the
most
graceful
manner
by
the
aerial
intermezzos
the
broidery
of
the
theme
which
charmingly
relieve
and
set
it
off
for
often
after
bowing
and
walking
together
a
little
near
but
not
touching
a
hermia
and
lysander
distance
both
rise
both
mount
attain
a
height
then
pause
and
as
from
the
summit
of
some
lofty
precipice
descend
on
outspread
in
a
very
music
of
motion
it
is
pretty
too
to
watch
two
of
them
flying
together
and
then
alighting
when
one
instantly
bows
before
the
other
with
mien
before
you
have
not
known
which
was
which
or
who
was
escorting
the
other
now
you
feel
sure
that
it
is
the
the
pompously
bowing
bird
who
has
taken
the
retiring
the
coy
one
for
a
little
fly
for
though
it
is
undoubted
that
the
female
bows
to
the
male
yet
in
courting
it
is
the
male
i
believe
who
commences
and
carries
it
to
a
fine
art
there
are
no
birds
surely
or
at
least
not
many
who
can
sport
more
gracefully
in
the
air
than
these
one
is
sitting
and
cooing
almost
in
a
and
so
close
to
a
rabbit
there
that
it
looks
like
a
little
call
sure
enough
too
after
a
while
the
bird
who
of
course
is
the
visitor
rises
but
into
the
air
and
makes
as
though
to
fly
away
but
having
gone
only
a
little
distance
with
quick
strokes
of
the
wings
it
rests
upon
their
expanded
surface
and
in
a
lovely
easy
sweep
sails
round
again
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
started
it
passes
beyond
the
place
the
wings
now
again
pulsating
then
makes
another
wide
sweep
of
grace
and
comes
down
near
where
it
was
before
in
a
little
it
again
rises
again
sweeps
and
circles
and
again
descends
in
the
neighbourhood
another
now
appears
flying
towards
it
and
as
it
passes
over
where
the
first
is
sitting
this
one
rises
into
the
air
to
meet
it
they
approach
glide
from
each
other
again
approach
and
thus
alternately
widening
and
narrowing
the
distance
between
them
one
at
length
goes
down
the
other
passing
on
to
alight
at
last
at
that
distance
which
the
etiquette
of
the
affair
prescribes
this
circling
flight
on
swiftly
resting
wings
is
most
beautiful
the
pausing
sweep
the
lazy
onwardness
the
marriage
as
it
were
of
rest
and
speed
is
a
delicious
thing
another
sense
a
delicate
purged
voluptuousness
a
very
banquet
to
the
eye
such
are
almost
always
in
the
early
morning
when
appreciative
persons
are
mostly
in
bed
seen
only
by
the
dull
eye
of
some
warrener
walking
to
find
and
kill
the
beasts
that
have
lain
tortured
in
his
traps
all
night
exciting
if
any
but
a
murderous
thought
at
the
time
with
the
if
i
a
had
a
gun
now
as
is
well
known
often
choose
to
lay
their
eggs
in
and
having
regard
to
their
powers
of
flight
and
arborial
aptitudes
it
might
be
thought
that
but
for
the
rabbits
they
would
never
be
seen
on
these
open
sandy
tracts
the
abode
of
the
peewit
ringed
plover
partridge
and
other
such
species
but
the
nesting
habits
of
a
bird
must
follow
its
general
ones
almost
necessarily
in
the
first
instance
and
though
there
are
many
apparently
striking
instances
to
the
contrary
they
are
probably
to
be
explained
by
the
former
having
remained
fixed
whilst
the
latter
have
changed
no
doubt
therefore
the
began
to
spend
much
of
its
time
on
the
ground
before
it
thought
of
laying
its
eggs
there
and
of
the
facilities
offered
by
for
so
doing
that
the
habits
as
well
as
the
organisms
of
all
living
creatures
are
in
a
more
or
less
plastic
and
fluctuating
state
is
i
believe
a
conclusion
come
to
by
darwin
and
it
agrees
entirely
with
the
little
i
have
been
able
to
observe
in
regard
to
birds
i
have
seen
the
robin
redbreast
become
a
wagtail
or
the
starling
a
or
the
also
a
the
wren
an
accomplished
the
a
partridge
or
plover
and
so
on
and
so
on
all
such
instances
having
been
noted
down
by
me
at
the
time
most
birds
are
ready
to
vary
their
habits
suddenly
and
if
they
can
get
a
little
profit
on
the
transaction
and
the
extent
to
which
they
have
varied
gradually
in
a
long
course
of
time
and
under
changed
conditions
is
of
course
a
commonplace
after
darwin
the
has
not
yet
begun
to
lay
its
eggs
in
or
anywhere
but
in
trees
and
bushes
but
that
it
may
some
day
do
so
is
not
improbable
for
it
comes
down
sometimes
though
not
very
frequently
on
the
same
sandy
wastes
that
are
loved
by
the
and
here
like
him
the
male
will
court
the
female
as
though
on
the
familiar
bough
when
i
have
seen
him
courting
her
thus
on
the
ground
the
low
bow
which
he
makes
her
has
been
prefaced
by
one
or
more
curious
hops
which
i
have
not
seen
in
the
courting
they
look
curious
because
they
are
so
out
of
character
hopping
being
as
far
as
i
know
a
mode
of
progression
foreign
to
all
the
whether
the
hops
upon
any
other
occasion
i
can
not
be
sure
if
he
does
not
and
it
is
certainly
not
his
usual
habit
his
adoption
of
it
here
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
purely
nuptial
antic
in
this
the
lark
which
is
also
a
stepping
and
not
a
hopping
bird
keeps
him
company
as
would
the
cormorant
were
it
not
that
he
hops
often
as
a
matter
of
convenience
larks
i
have
not
seen
hop
in
everyday
life
though
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
they
did
when
running
quickly
over
ploughed
land
in
winter
as
starlings
often
do
when
they
break
from
a
run
which
has
become
too
quick
for
them
into
a
running
hop
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
only
apparent
and
due
to
their
up
and
down
motion
over
the
clods
of
earth
a
hop
is
quite
foreign
to
the
lark
disposition
yet
when
courting
the
male
bird
advances
upon
the
female
with
wings
drooped
crest
and
tail
raised
and
with
a
series
of
impressive
hops
the
hop
of
the
under
similar
circumstances
is
of
a
heavy
and
deliberate
nature
as
might
be
expected
his
build
and
size
and
has
the
same
set
and
formal
from
character
as
the
bow
which
immediately
follows
it
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
the
bows
too
in
courtship
but
it
is
a
series
of
quick
little
bows
or
rather
bobs
which
he
makes
to
his
instead
of
one
or
more
slower
and
much
more
imposing
ones
essentially
however
it
is
the
same
thing
the
pace
has
been
quickened
and
the
interval
lessened
whilst
to
allow
of
the
increased
speed
the
bow
itself
has
been
shorn
of
much
of
its
pomp
and
circumstance
so
that
it
has
become
as
i
say
a
mere
bob
the
may
perform
some
or
more
of
these
bobs
taking
less
time
perhaps
to
get
through
them
than
do
his
larger
relatives
to
achieve
one
of
their
solemn
and
formal
bows
still
he
is
pompous
too
he
bends
down
low
at
the
shrine
and
though
each
little
bob
may
not
be
much
in
itself
yet
when
thus
strung
together
the
display
as
a
whole
is
equal
to
the
other
two
all
the
time
he
is
thus
bowing
or
bobbing
the
utters
a
deep
rolling
musical
note
which
is
continuous
or
sounds
so
and
does
not
cease
till
he
has
got
back
into
his
more
everyday
attitude
the
hen
looks
sometimes
surprised
sometimes
as
though
she
had
expected
it
and
sometimes
i
think
but
of
this
i
am
not
quite
positive
she
will
return
the
little
series
of
musical
bobs
this
is
in
but
i
have
seen
the
court
on
the
ground
and
he
then
between
his
bobbings
made
a
curious
dancing
step
towards
the
female
who
retired
and
gave
her
final
answer
by
flying
away
but
besides
this
these
birds
have
another
and
most
charming
nuptial
disportment
sitting
in
some
high
tree
one
of
them
will
every
now
and
again
fly
out
of
it
mount
upwards
make
one
or
two
circling
sweeps
around
and
above
it
then
after
remaining
poised
for
some
seconds
descend
on
spread
wings
in
the
most
graceful
manner
alighting
on
the
same
branch
beside
the
waiting
partner
this
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
see
and
especially
in
the
early
fresh
morning
of
a
clear
lovely
day
it
seems
then
as
if
the
bird
kept
flying
up
to
greet
the
early
rising
sun
or
as
rejoicing
in
the
beauty
of
all
things
these
are
the
coquetries
the
prettinesses
of
loving
couples
as
to
which
on
one
side
at
least
what
has
not
been
said
by
the
writers
of
our
clumsy
race
but
if
the
lions
were
sculptors
how
might
a
bird
novelist
expatiate
illustration
the
nuptial
not
less
beautiful
is
the
nuptial
flight
of
the
of
this
the
clapping
of
the
wings
above
the
back
is
the
most
salient
feature
a
sound
which
is
never
heard
during
the
winter
or
after
the
is
fairly
over
in
full
flight
the
bird
smites
its
wings
two
or
three
times
smartly
together
above
the
back
then
holding
them
extended
and
motionless
it
seems
to
pause
for
one
instant
if
there
can
be
pause
in
swiftest
motion
before
sinking
and
then
rising
and
sinking
again
as
does
a
wave
or
as
though
it
rested
on
an
aerial
switchback
then
continuing
his
flight
recommencing
that
is
to
say
the
strokes
of
his
wings
he
may
do
the
same
when
he
has
gone
a
few
farther
and
so
pass
in
music
out
of
sight
sometimes
there
will
be
only
a
single
clap
of
the
wings
instead
of
two
or
three
but
always
it
is
made
just
before
the
of
them
and
the
hanging
pause
in
the
air
for
let
the
speed
be
never
so
great
and
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
it
could
be
checked
so
suddenly
and
why
should
the
bird
wish
to
check
it
yet
the
effect
upon
the
eye
of
the
wings
extended
and
motionless
after
they
have
been
pulsating
so
rapidly
is
as
of
a
pause
this
pause
or
rather
this
as
the
bird
renouncing
all
effort
is
carried
swiftly
and
placidly
onwards
in
a
curve
of
the
extremest
beauty
has
a
delicious
effect
upon
one
one
spirit
goes
out
until
one
seems
to
be
with
the
bird
oneself
hanging
and
sweeping
as
it
does
yet
in
this
glory
of
motion
it
will
often
be
shot
by
beings
in
all
grace
and
beauty
and
poetry
of
life
how
infinitely
its
inferiors
this
makes
me
think
of
darwin
comment
upon
bate
account
of
a
caught
and
killed
by
a
huge
brazilian
spider
wherein
the
destroyer
and
the
victim
one
perhaps
the
loveliest
the
other
the
most
hideous
in
the
scale
of
creation
are
contrasted
spiders
too
had
they
their
phidiases
might
be
idealised
and
made
to
look
quite
beautiful
in
marble
even
perhaps
to
our
eyes
what
can
not
genius
do
whilst
to
their
own
of
course
the
form
would
be
the
spider
form
divine
sometimes
too
not
any
the
flight
being
the
same
i
quote
from
memory
will
also
fly
circling
about
above
the
trees
in
which
they
have
been
sitting
in
rapid
pursuit
of
each
other
and
whilst
doing
so
one
or
other
of
them
may
be
heard
to
make
a
very
pronounced
swishing
or
beating
sound
with
the
wings
reminding
one
of
the
peewit
nightjar
and
a
great
many
other
birds
of
instrumental
music
produced
during
flight
the
snipe
is
a
familiar
example
here
however
the
very
peculiar
and
highly
specialised
sound
known
as
bleating
or
drumming
is
produced
not
by
the
feathers
of
the
wing
but
by
those
of
the
tail
which
have
been
specially
modified
as
we
may
suppose
those
at
least
of
us
who
are
believers
in
that
force
by
a
process
of
musical
sexual
selection
to
quote
darwin
no
one
was
able
to
explain
the
cause
until
mr
meves
observed
that
on
each
side
of
the
tail
the
outer
feathers
are
peculiarly
formed
having
a
stiff
shaft
with
the
oblique
barbs
of
unusual
length
the
outer
webs
being
strongly
bound
together
he
found
that
by
blowing
on
these
feathers
or
by
fastening
them
to
a
long
thin
stick
and
waving
them
rapidly
through
the
air
he
could
reproduce
the
drumming
noise
made
by
the
living
bird
both
sexes
are
furnished
with
these
feathers
but
they
are
generally
larger
in
the
male
than
in
the
female
and
emit
a
deeper
note
the
possibility
of
reproducing
the
sound
in
the
manner
described
seems
conclusive
as
to
the
cause
of
it
otherwise
i
should
have
come
to
the
conclusion
by
watching
the
bird
that
the
wings
and
not
the
tail
were
the
agency
employed
i
have
just
been
watching
for
some
time
a
snipe
continually
coursing
through
the
air
and
making
at
intervals
the
drumming
or
bleating
sound
bleating
certainly
seems
to
me
the
word
which
best
expresses
its
quality
the
wings
are
constantly
and
quickly
quivered
not
only
when
the
bird
rises
or
flies
straight
forward
but
also
during
its
swift
oblique
descents
when
one
might
expect
that
they
would
be
held
rigid
in
the
ordinary
manner
from
each
sweep
down
the
bird
rises
and
beats
again
upwards
but
when
the
flight
has
been
continued
long
enough
the
wings
are
pressed
to
the
sides
as
the
plunge
to
earth
is
made
which
is
also
one
way
in
which
the
lark
descends
it
is
during
these
downward
flights
but
not
during
the
descent
to
earth
that
the
sound
strikes
the
ear
a
second
bird
flies
to
my
surprise
and
interest
quite
differently
after
scudding
about
for
some
little
time
in
a
devious
pathway
less
up
and
down
as
it
seems
to
me
than
the
other
it
suddenly
tilts
itself
sideways
or
almost
sideways
one
wing
pointing
skywards
the
other
earthwards
and
makes
a
rapid
swoop
down
with
the
wings
not
beating
i
watch
it
doing
this
time
after
time
both
with
the
naked
eye
and
through
the
glasses
and
each
time
that
the
swoop
is
made
no
bleating
or
other
sound
accompanies
it
the
flight
is
noiseless
like
that
of
an
ordinary
bird
two
other
snipes
are
now
flying
about
in
this
latter
way
and
chasing
each
other
at
first
and
this
included
a
great
many
sweeps
down
i
heard
no
sound
afterwards
i
thought
i
heard
it
faintly
sometimes
but
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
not
made
by
another
bird
a
frequent
difficulty
in
watching
snipe
again
a
snipe
is
standing
alone
the
melancholy
marshes
quite
still
and
uttering
the
creaky
note
i
can
see
the
two
long
mandibles
of
the
beak
dividing
slightly
and
again
closing
the
note
is
now
thin
and
subdued
but
the
bird
taking
flight
suddenly
it
becomes
much
accentuated
it
joins
two
other
birds
in
the
air
and
all
three
now
sport
and
pursue
each
other
about
constantly
uttering
this
cry
but
bleating
only
occasionally
i
am
lying
flat
on
the
ground
and
they
often
fly
close
about
and
over
me
the
light
too
being
good
it
being
all
before
and
not
much
after
perhaps
when
it
commenced
this
was
april
i
note
that
they
often
descend
through
the
air
without
vibrating
the
wings
and
there
is
then
no
bleating
sound
this
whilst
quite
close
i
think
but
am
not
yet
quite
sure
that
they
sometimes
descend
in
this
way
uttering
the
cry
when
they
bleat
however
there
is
never
the
cry
at
the
same
time
it
is
impossible
to
tell
when
these
birds
are
going
to
alight
as
they
often
descend
in
the
manner
that
they
use
when
alighting
but
when
almost
down
skim
a
little
just
over
the
ground
and
rising
again
continue
their
flight
as
before
yet
that
they
have
had
it
in
their
mind
to
alight
i
feel
sure
for
they
always
do
so
with
that
particular
action
since
then
the
snipe
has
two
ways
of
making
his
rapid
descents
through
the
air
in
one
of
which
he
quivers
his
wings
and
in
the
other
not
and
since
on
the
latter
occasion
the
bleat
is
not
heard
or
if
heard
only
faintly
it
would
be
natural
to
suppose
that
the
sound
if
not
vocal
was
produced
by
the
rapidly
vibrating
feathers
of
the
wing
when
in
swift
downward
motion
rather
than
by
those
of
the
tail
which
should
not
one
would
think
be
affected
by
the
difference
also
the
fact
of
the
vocal
note
not
being
uttered
at
the
same
time
as
the
bleat
might
make
one
think
that
this
too
was
vocal
such
arguments
however
would
be
at
best
but
poor
seemings
and
thin
likelihoods
the
last
one
i
believe
not
supported
by
what
we
know
at
least
i
can
not
at
the
moment
think
of
a
bird
that
produces
vocal
and
instrumental
music
at
the
same
time
if
the
sound
can
really
be
reproduced
by
waving
the
modified
feathers
of
the
tail
then
this
is
a
demonstration
i
have
lately
observed
that
when
the
snipe
descends
with
quivering
wings
some
outer
feathers
of
the
tail
on
each
side
are
shot
out
from
it
in
a
most
noticeable
manner
making
or
looking
like
two
little
curved
tufts
they
are
not
seen
before
which
seems
to
me
strong
evidence
the
tail
itself
is
fanned
snipe
as
already
observed
descend
to
the
ground
in
order
to
alight
upon
it
in
a
manner
quite
different
to
the
oblique
sweeps
with
wings
extended
whether
vibrating
or
not
as
practised
in
ordinary
nuptial
flight
there
are
three
ways
possibly
more
but
three
i
have
seen
in
the
first
the
bird
shoots
gracefully
down
with
the
wings
pressed
to
the
sides
as
already
described
in
the
second
the
wings
are
raised
straight
or
almost
straight
above
the
back
and
this
gives
perhaps
a
still
more
graceful
appearance
the
third
way
is
not
nearly
so
usual
a
one
as
the
other
two
in
fact
i
only
recall
having
seen
it
once
in
this
the
wings
are
but
half
spread
whilst
held
in
the
ordinary
manner
and
motionless
and
the
bird
descends
in
several
sweeps
to
one
side
or
the
other
something
after
the
manner
in
which
a
kite
comes
to
the
ground
no
sound
attends
any
of
these
forms
of
descent
the
cry
of
the
snipe
which
i
have
alluded
to
is
of
a
curious
nature
something
like
the
word
constantly
repeated
and
having
a
regular
rise
and
fall
in
it
which
is
why
i
call
it
a
note
sometimes
when
the
bird
is
a
little
way
off
it
sounds
very
much
like
a
swishing
of
the
wings
but
when
these
are
really
swished
as
they
often
are
purposely
i
believe
and
as
a
nuptial
performance
the
difference
is
at
once
apparent
two
snipes
will
often
fly
chasing
each
other
uttering
this
note
and
making
from
time
to
time
the
loud
swishing
with
the
wings
often
too
there
will
be
a
short
harsh
cry
harsh
but
with
that
wild
loved
harshness
that
lives
in
the
notes
of
birds
that
haunt
the
waste
which
is
instantly
followed
by
a
swishing
of
the
wings
making
quite
a
music
in
the
air
when
at
its
loudest
and
harshest
this
cry
which
then
becomes
a
scream
is
quite
an
extraordinary
sound
having
a
mewing
intonation
in
it
suggesting
a
cat
as
the
performer
yet
it
is
nothing
so
extraordinary
as
some
notes
of
the
snipe
which
i
have
heard
mostly
during
the
winter
and
which
are
indeed
at
least
they
have
struck
me
as
being
so
amongst
the
most
wonderful
that
ever
issued
from
the
throat
of
bird
i
will
recur
to
them
again
when
i
come
to
the
for
it
was
in
his
company
i
heard
them
a
bird
that
is
itself
as
a
whole
orchestra
of
peculiar
brazen
instruments
these
wild
cries
and
screams
blend
harmoniously
with
the
curious
monotonous
yet
musical
bleating
and
come
finely
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
evening
thickening
into
night
as
it
descends
over
the
wide
expanse
of
the
fenlands
best
heard
then
and
there
the
darkening
sky
the
wide
and
waste
of
coarse
tufted
grass
amongst
which
brown
stand
and
thinly
the
long
raised
bank
with
its
thin
belt
of
reeds
beyond
emphasising
rather
than
relieving
the
flatness

lonely

stunted
willow
or

the
black
line
of
alders
marking
the
course
of
the
sluggish
river

music

the
wilder
music
in
the
air
the
aloneness

drearness
such
voices
fit
such
scenes
the
male
and
female
snipe
both
bleat
but
the
feathers
in
the
tail
which
produce
the
sound
are
less
modified
in
the
female
and
the
sound
which
they
produce
is
said
to
be
different
in
consequence
that
there
must
be
a
difference
would
seem
to
follow
of
necessity
but
according
to
my
own
experience
it
requires
a
nice
ear
to
distinguish
the
bleating
of
the
one
sex
from
that
of
the
other
there
is
indeed
some
slight
difference
in
the
sound
made
by
each
individual
snipe
but
i
only
once
remember
hearing
one
bleating
with
a
markedly
different
tone
here
the
sound
had
a
lower
softer
and
deeper
intonation
and
was
to
my
mind
a
more
musical
sound
altogether
when
heard
just
before
or
after
the
bleat
of
another
snipe
the
difference
was
very
marked
but
i
considered
it
to
be
rather
an
individual
than
a
sexual
distinction
for
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
female
snipe
bleats
less
frequently
than
the
male
except
when
she
is
sitting
on
her
eggs
snipe
when
bleating
fly
round
and
round
in
a
wide
irregular
circle
and
for
a
long
time
one
will
not
overstep
the
invisible
boundary
so
as
to
encroach
upon
the
domain
of
the
other
it
seems
but
the
illusion
will
be
broken
after
a
time
as
though
each
bird
had
his
allotment
in
the
fields
of
air
and
knew
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
a
rudeness
in
entering
that
of
another
thus
though
three
or
four
of
them
may
be
flying
and
bleating
in
the
neighbourhood
it
is
often
difficult
to
watch
more
than
one
at
a
time
with
anything
like
closeness
of
observation
a
difficulty
which
is
often
increased
by
the
failing
light
for
in
my
own
experience
snipe
bleat
best
either
in
the
early
though
not
very
early
morning
or
when
evening
has
begun
to
close
in
to
follow
their
wide
swift
eccentric
circle
of
flight
one
must
keep
turning
round
on
a
fixed
point
and
this
amidst
swamp
and
is
difficult
to
do
without
losing
one
balance
yet
still
one
watches
and
turns
and
strains
one
eyes
into
the
darkness
unable
to
go
for
one
loves
to
see
that
small
swift
vocal
shadow
appearing
out
of
the
great
still
silent
ones
and
disappearing
again
into
them
when
thus
disporting
each
within
its
own
charmed
circle
the
downward
rush
and
bleat
of
one
snipe
will
often
for
a
long
time
immediately
precede
or
follow
that
of
another
bleat
answering
to
bleat
till
at
length
the
duet
is
broken
and
complicated
by
a
third
intermingling
voice
at
last
a
bird
trampling
on
etiquette
will
flit
into
the
circle
of
the
one
you
are
watching
and
the
two
excitedly
pursuing
each
other
with
or
with
the
harsh
wild
scream
and
loud
swish
of
pinions
will
speed
off
and
vanish
together
no
doubt
the
male
snipes
bleat
against
each
other
in
rivalry
but
it
would
also
seem
a
sentence
i
confess
which
i
never
use
when
i
have
an
undoubted
instance
to
give
that
the
male
and
female
bleat
to
one
another
connubially
or
in
a
manner
here
however
is
an
instance
as
i
translate
it
of
the
one
bleating
whilst
the
other
sits
listening
and
responding
vocally
on
the
ground
a
snipe
flies
with
a
scream
over
the
marshy
meadows
as
he
passes
one
little
swampy
bit
another
snipe
utters
from
out
of
it
the
note
in
answer
as
it
appears
to
the
scream
the
first
snipe
now
flies
round
about
over
the
meadows
and
land
adjoining
bleating
whilst
the
other
one
in
the
grass
continues
to
many
birds
as
is
well
known
have
the
instinct
when
suddenly
discovered
with
their
young
ones
of
tumbling
over
or
fluttering
along
the
ground
as
though
they
had
sustained
some
injury
which
had
rendered
them
unable
to
fly
so
that
the
murderous
or
thievish
longings
of
the
paragon
of
animals
being
diverted
from
their
progeny
to
themselves
the
former
may
take
thought
and
escape
the
nightjar
partridge
and
especially
the
are
good
instances
of
this
and
in
every
case
where
i
have
come
upon
them
under
the
requisite
conditions
they
have
never
failed
to
show
me
their
shrewd
estimate
of
man
nature
with
all
these
three
birds
however
it
has
always
been
the
presence
of
the
young
that
has
moved
them
to
act
in
this
manner
their
conduct
during
incubation
being
quite
different
the
instance
which
i
am
now
going
to
bring
forward
with
regard
to
the
snipe
has
this
peculiarity
if
it
be
one
that
the
bird
was
hatching
her
eggs
at
the
time
and
was
still
engaged
in
doing
so
a
few
days
afterwards
proving
that
the
young
were
not
just
on
the
point
of
coming
out
on
the
occasion
when
she
was
first
disturbed
as
i
noted
all
down
the
instant
after
its
occurrence
the
reader
may
rely
upon
having
here
just
exactly
what
this
snipe
did
this
morning
a
snipe
flew
out
of
some
long
reedy
grass
within
a
few
feet
of
me
and
almost
instantly
taking
the
ground
again
but
now
on
the
smooth
green
meadow
spun
round
over
it
now
here
now
there
its
long
bill
lying
along
the
ground
as
though
it
were
the
pivot
on
which
it
turned
and
uttering
loud
cries
all
the
while
having
done
this
for
a
minute
or
so
it
lay
or
rather
crouched
quite
still
on
the
ground
its
head
and
beak
lying
along
it
its
neck
outstretched
its
legs
bent
under
it
with
the
body
rising
gradually
till
the
posterior
part
with
the
tail
which
it
kept
fanned
out
was
right
in
the
air
and
in
this
strange
position
it
kept
uttering
a
long
low
hoarse
note
which
together
with
its
whole
demeanour
seemed
to
betoken
great
distress
it
remained
thus
for
some
minutes
before
flying
away
during
which
time
i
stood
still
watching
it
closely
and
when
it
was
gone
soon
found
the
nest
with
four
eggs
in
it
in
the
from
which
it
had
flown
its
action
whilst
spinning
over
the
ground
was
very
like
that
of
the
nightjar
when
put
up
from
her
young
ones
it
is
to
be
noted
here
that
this
snipe
flew
a
very
little
way
from
the
nest
and
when
on
the
ground
did
not
travel
over
it
to
any
extent
but
only
in
a
small
circle
just
at
first
after
which
it
kept
in
one
place
the
arctic
skua
richardson
skua
as
some
call
it
but
i
hate
such
appropriative
titles
as
though
a
species
could
be
any
man
property
behaves
in
the
same
kind
of
way
for
lying
along
on
its
breast
with
its
wings
spread
out
and
beating
the
ground
it
utters
plaintive
little
pitiful
cries
keeping
always
in
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
spot
this
has
of
course
the
effect
of
drawing
one
attention
to
the
bird
and
away
from
the
eggs
or
young
whether
it
acts
thus
in
regard
to
both
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
believe
that
it
does
but
the
effect
produced
on
one
though
here
of
course
as
throughout
i
only
speak
for
myself
is
that
the
bird
is
in
great
mental
distress
prostrated
as
it
were
rather
than
acting
with
any
conscious
intent
to
deceive
the
same
is
the
case
with
the
nightjar
whose
sudden
spinning
about
over
the
ground
in
a
manner
much
more
resembling
a
maimed
bluebottle
or
cockchafer
than
a
bird
seems
to
proceed
from
some
violent
nervous
shock
or
mental
disturbance
the
same
too
though
in
a
lesser
degree
may
be
said
of
the
partridge
and
in
all
cases
it
is
obvious
that
the
bird
is
very
much
excited
and
darwin
if
i
remember
rightly
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
birds
when
they
thus
distract
our
attention
from
their
young
to
themselves
do
so
with
a
full
consciousness
of
what
they
are
doing
and
why
they
are
doing
it
when
the
female
however
acts
in
this
manner
it
is
difficult
i
think
to
escape
from
this
conclusion
she
flaps
for
a
long
way
over
the
surface
of
the
water
pausing
every
now
and
again
and
waiting
as
though
to
see
the
effect
of
her
ruse
and
continuing
her
tactics
as
soon
as
you
get
up
to
her
having
thus
led
you
a
long
distance
away
she
rises
and
leaving
the
river
flies
in
an
extended
circle
which
will
ultimately
bring
her
back
to
it
by
the
other
bank
when
you
are
well
out
of
the
way
the
chicks
meanwhile
have
of
course
scuttled
in
amongst
the
reeds
and
rushes
though
they
often
take
some
little
while
to
conceal
themselves
she
acts
thus
on
a
river
or
broad
stretch
of
water
which
enables
her
to
keep
you
in
sight
for
some
time
but
it
is
obvious
that
if
you
come
upon
her
with
her
family
in
a
very
narrow
and
sharply
winding
stream
the
first
bend
of
it
will
hide
you
from
her
and
she
would
then
assuming
that
she
is
acting
intelligently
have
all
the
agony
of
mind
of
not
knowing
whether
her
plan
was
succeeding
or
not
it
was
in
such
a
situation
that
i
met
her
only
last
spring
and
to
my
surprise
and
indeed
admiration
instead
of
flapping
along
the
water
as
i
have
always
known
her
to
do
before
in
such
a
she
instantly
flew
out
on
to
the
opposite
bank
and
began
to
flap
and
struggle
along
the
flat
marshy
of
course
in
full
view
i
crossed
the
stream
and
pursued
her
allowing
her
to
fool
me
to
the
top
of
my
bent
and
this
she
appeared
to
me
to
do
or
to
think
she
was
doing
on
much
the
same
kind
of
as
one
would
go
by
in
the
case
of
a
man
now
unless
this
bird
had
wished
to
keep
me
in
view
and
thus
judge
of
the
effect
of
her
stratagem
or
unless
she
feared
that
out
of
sight
would
be
out
of
mind
with
regard
to
herself
but
this
would
be
to
credit
her
with
yet
greater
powers
of
reflection
why
should
she
have
left
the
water
the
element
in
which
she
usually
and
most
naturally
performs
these
actions
to
modify
them
on
the
land
yet
to
suppose
that
it
has
ever
occurred
suddenly
and
as
a
new
idea
to
any
bird
to
act
a
pious
fraud
of
this
kind
would
be
to
suppose
wonders
and
also
to
be
unevolutionary
almost
as
serious
a
matter
nowadays
as
to
be
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
passage
so
may
be
mistaken
but
may
we
not
think
that
an
act
which
in
its
origin
has
been
of
a
nervous
and
as
it
were
pathological
character
has
become
in
time
blended
with
intelligence
and
that
natural
selection
has
not
only
picked
out
those
birds
who
best
performed
a
mechanical
action
which
though
it
sprung
merely
from
mental
disturbance
was
yet
of
a
beneficial
nature
but
also
those
whose
intelligence
began
after
a
time
to
enable
them
to
see
whereto
such
action
tended
and
thus
consciously
to
guide
and
improve
it
there
is
evidence
i
believe
though
neither
space
nor
the
nature
of
this
slight
work
will
allow
me
to
go
into
it
that
such
abnormal
mental
states
as
of
old
inspired
the
priest
from
the
prophetic
cell
and
influence
priests
or
amongst
savages
to
go
no
farther
can
be
and
are
combined
with
ordinary
shrewd
intelligence
nor
does
it
seem
too
much
to
suppose
that
a
bird
that
was
always
seeing
the
effect
of
what
it
did
when
it
as
it
were
fell
into
hysterics
should
have
come
in
time
to
reckon
upon
the
hysterics
to
know
what
they
were
good
for
and
even
to
some
extent
to
direct
them
as
a
great
actor
in
an
emotional
scene
must
govern
himself
in
the
main
though
probably
a
great
deal
of
the
gesture
action
and
facial
expression
is
unconsciously
and
spontaneously
performed
now
if
we
assume
that
these
ruses
employed
by
birds
for
the
protection
of
their
young
as
in
the
case
of
the
have
commenced
in
purely
involuntary
movements
without
any
proposed
object
the
instance
here
given
of
the
snipe
may
perhaps
throw
some
light
upon
their
origin
a
bird
whilst
incubating
and
thus
hour
after
hour
doing
violence
to
its
active
and
energetic
disposition
is
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
force
in
opposition
to
and
overcoming
the
forces
which
usually
govern
it
its
mental
state
may
be
supposed
to
be
a
and
tense
one
and
it
therefore
does
not
seem
surprising
that
some
sudden
surprise
and
startle
at
such
a
time
by
rousing
a
force
opposite
to
that
under
the
control
of
which
it
then
is
and
producing
thereby
a
violent
conflict
should
throw
it
off
its
mental
balance
and
so
produce
something
in
the
nature
of
hysteria
or
convulsions
but
let
this
once
take
place
with
anything
like
frequency
in
the
case
of
any
bird
and
natural
selection
will
begin
to
act
as
the
eggs
of
a
bird
are
stationary
and
do
not
run
away
or
seek
shelter
whilst
the
parent
bird
is
thus
behaving
in
their
neighbourhood
it
would
on
the
whole
be
better
for
it
to
sit
close
or
to
fly
away
in
an
ordinary
and
manner
allowing
this
then
as
the
eggs
of
a
bird
would
be
less
exposed
to
danger
the
less
often
the
sitting
bird
went
off
them
in
this
way
might
not
natural
selection
keep
throwing
the
impulse
to
do
so
farther
and
farther
backwards
till
after
the
incubatory
process
was
completed
then
the
tendency
would
be
encouraged
at
least
in
the
case
of
birds
whose
young
can
early
get
about
for
as
a
rule
such
antics
would
shield
them
better
than
sitting
still
the
young
would
generally
be
in
several
places
giving
as
many
chances
of
discovery
and
on
account
of
the
suddenness
of
the
surprise
would
often
be
running
or
otherwise
exposing
themselves
take
for
instance
the
case
of
the
where
i
have
always
found
the
brood
a
most
conspicuous
object
at
first
and
taking
some
time
even
on
reedy
rivers
to
get
into
concealment
and
i
can
see
no
reason
why
an
aiding
intelligence
in
the
performance
of
such
movements
should
not
be
selected
with
the
movements
themselves
though
of
a
nervous
and
originally
purely
automatic
character
natural
selection
would
in
this
way
develop
a
special
intelligence
in
the
performance
of
some
special
actions
out
of
proportion
to
the
general
intelligence
of
the
creature
performing
them
though
no
doubt
this
also
would
tend
to
be
thereby
enlarged
and
this
is
what
in
fact
we
often
do
see
or
seem
to
see
i
may
add
that
when
a
few
days
afterwards
i
again
approached
this
same
nest
the
bird
went
off
it
without
any
performance
of
the
sort
this
if
we
could
be
sure
that
it
was
the
same
bird
would
seem
to
show
that
the
habit
was
in
an
unfixed
and
fluctuating
condition
on
the
other
hand
a
bird
that
acts
thus
in
the
case
of
its
young
would
i
think
always
act
so
perhaps
it
may
be
wondered
why
i
have
not
included
the
peewit
in
the
list
of
birds
which
employ
or
appear
to
employ
a
ruse
in
favour
of
their
young
ones
since
this
bird
is
always
given
as
the
stock
instance
of
it
the
reason
is
that
whilst
the
birds
i
mentioned
have
always
in
my
experience
gone
off
so
to
speak
like
when
the
occasion
for
it
arrived
i
have
never
known
a
peewit
to
do
so
though
i
have
probably
disturbed
as
many
scores
perhaps
hundreds
of
them
under
the
requisite
conditions
as
i
have
units
of
the
others
i
have
also
inquired
of
keepers
and
warreners
and
found
their
experience
to
tally
with
mine
they
have
spoken
of
the
cock
bird
leading
you
astray
aerially
whilst
the
hen
sits
on
the
nest
and
of
both
of
them
flying
with
screams
close
about
your
head
when
the
young
are
out
which
statements
i
have
often
verified
but
they
have
never
professed
to
have
seen
a
peewit
flapping
over
the
ground
as
with
a
broken
wing
in
the
way
it
is
so
constantly
said
to
do
i
can
not
therefore
but
think
that
by
some
chance
or
other
an
action
common
to
many
birds
has
been
particularly
and
yet
wrongly
ascribed
to
the
peewit
as
it
seems
to
me
this
is
just
one
of
those
cases
where
negative
evidence
is
almost
as
strong
as
affirmative
and
though
of
course
quite
ready
to
accept
any
properly
witnessed
instance
of
the
peewit
acting
in
this
way
i
can
not
but
conclude
that
it
does
so
very
rarely
indeed
illustration
chapter
iv
watching
wheatears
dabchicks
etc
the
wheatear
is
common
over
the
and
as
i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
witness
for
a
whole
afternoon
and
very
closely
a
series
of
combined
displays
and
combats
on
the
part
of
two
rival
males
which
struck
me
as
very
interesting
and
as
bearing
on
the
question
of
sexual
selection
i
will
give
the
account
as
i
noted
it
down
from
point
to
point
between
the
intervals
of
following
the
birds
about
on
my
hands
and
knees
should
the
narrative
be
tedious
and
it
is
i
confess
somewhat
minute
i
need
not
ask
my
readers
to
absolve
nature
and
give
me
the
blame
of
it
for
i
am
assured
that
anyone
in
the
least
degree
interested
in
birds
and
their
ways
might
have
lain
and
watched
these
bizarreries
a
hundred
times
repeated
without
wishing
to
get
up
and
go
my
observations
were
made
on
the
last
day
but
one
of
march
and
are
as
follows
about
two
male
wheatears
have
for
some
time
been
hopping
about
in
each
other
company
and
one
now
makes
a
hostile
demonstration
against
the
other
this
he
does
by
advancing
and
lowering
the
head
with
the
beak
pointed
straight
forward
ruffling
out
the
feathers
fanning
the
tail
and
making
a
sudden
swift
run
towards
him
he
stops
however
before
the
point
of
actual
contact
and
the
two
birds
hop
about
each
affecting
to
think
very
little
about
the
other
the
wheatear
i
should
say
always
hops
and
by
so
doing
always
give
me
something
of
a
surprise
for
there
is
that
in
his
appearance
which
does
not
suggest
hopping
but
rather
that
he
would
run
over
the
ground
like
a
wagtail
his
hops
however
are
so
quick
and
take
him
forward
so
smoothly
that
the
effect
on
the
eye
is
often
much
more
like
running
than
hopping
i
therefore
often
speak
of
him
as
running
though
i
believe
he
never
does
so
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
to
continue
after
some
time
during
which
there
was
nothing
specially
noteworthy
in
their
behaviour
the
two
birds
flew
one
after
the
other
to
some
little
distance
off
on
a
higher
and
more
sandy
part
of
the
warren
and
here
a
female
wheatear
appeared
hopping
near
them
one
of
the
males
at
once
ran
to
her
but
had
instantly
to
fly
before
the
fierce
wrath
of
the
other
the
hen
then
flew
to
a
stunted
willow
in
the
neighbourhood
where
she
sat
perched
amongst
the
topmost
twigs
the
males
not
following
her
but
continuing
to
hop
about
in
each
other
vicinity
as
before
she
remained
there
some
five
or
ten
minutes
when
she
flew
out
over
the
warrens
and
with
my
attention
concentrated
on
the
rival
birds
i
lost
her
and
can
not
say
where
she
went
down
one
of
the
male
wheatears
now
enters
a
shallow
depression
in
the
ground
not
a
hole
or
the
mouth
of
a
but
one
of
those
natural
fallings
away
of
the
soil
which
make
rugged
and
give
a
character
to
these
sandy
wastes
as
soon
as
he
is
in
it
he
seems
to
become
excited
and
running
forward
and
coming
out
on
the
opposite
brink
he
flies
from
this
to
the
one
by
which
he
has
entered
hardly
two
feet
off
then
instantly
back
again
again
to
the
other
and
so
backwards
and
forwards
some
dozen
or
twenty
times
so
rapidly
that
he
makes
of
himself
a
little
arch
in
the
air
constantly
spanning
the
hollow
all
in
the
greatest
excitement
finishing
here
he
runs
a
little
way
to
another
such
depression
enters
it
and
coming
out
again
acts
in
precisely
the
same
way
making
the
same
little
rapidly
moving
arch
of
two
black
wings
moving
now
this
way
now
that
now
forwards
now
backwards
from
edge
to
edge
of
the
trough
perching
each
time
on
each
edge
of
it
but
so
quickly
it
seems
rather
to
be
on
the
points
of
the
wings
than
the
feet
that
he
comes
down
wings
are
all
one
sees
they
whirl
forwards
and
backwards
backwards
and
forwards
making
a
little
arch
or
bridge
the
highest
point
of
which
in
the
centre
which
is
the
point
of
the
upper
wing
is
some
two
feet
from
the
floor
of
the
trough
whilst
the
point
of
the
lower
one
almost
touches
it
all
this
time
the
other
male
bird
is
quite
near
but
seems
to
take
little
notice
of
the
performance
at
length
the
frenzied
one
desists
from
his
madness
of
motion
and
the
two
now
hop
about
over
the
warren
as
before
closely
in
each
other
company
in
some
ten
minutes
or
so
there
is
the
same
display
or
rather
frenzy
but
whether
made
by
the
same
bird
or
the
other
one
i
am
unable
to
say
this
time
it
commences
on
the
even
turf
and
not
in
a
hollow
but
after
a
few
throws
the
bird
finds
one
and
throws
thenceforth
over
that
i
have
seen
i
think
a
japanese
acrobat
throw
a
wonderful
succession
of
somersaults
backwards
and
forwards
within
his
own
length
with
the
bird
there
was
no
somersault
but
the
effect
was
something
the
same
the
man
body
also
presented
the
appearance
of
an
arch
in
the
air
as
when
one
vibrates
a
lighted
from
side
to
side
but
as
the
bird
moved
much
more
quickly
the
resemblance
in
its
case
was
more
perfect
once
or
twice
again
now
one
of
the
two
birds
acts
in
the
same
way
always
seeming
to
prefer
to
do
so
over
a
depression
in
the
ground
one
then
flies
up
a
little
way
into
the
air
descends
again
and
on
alighting
instantly
recommences
as
before
again
i
think
over
a
slight
hollow
the
motion
is
equally
violent
but
not
so
long
continued
some
seven
or
eight
flings
perhaps
in
all
at
the
end
of
it
he
stops
still
advances
the
head
straight
forwards
lowering
it
a
trifle
swells
the
feathers
and
broadly
fans
the
tail
then
the
two
birds
fly
at
each
other
but
almost
in
the
act
of
closing
they
part
with
a
little
twitter
and
commence
hopping
over
the
warren
as
before
it
is
a
constant
little
run
of
hops
a
pause
and
then
another
little
run
of
hops
each
bird
following
the
other
about
in
turn
the
distance
between
them
being
as
a
rule
from
two
or
three
feet
to
five
or
six
paces
another
little
fly
up
into
the
air
followed
by
the
frenzied
dance
on
descending
then
the
two
come
together
in
the
mouth
of
a
fly
at
each
other
as
before
separate
again
almost
immediately
and
continue
their
hopping
over
the
warren
the
one
still
dogging
the
other
the
two
fly
at
each
other
as
though
to
fight
but
again
just
as
they
seem
about
to
meet
they
avoid
and
quicker
than
the
eye
can
follow
they
are
a
yard
or
so
apart
one
of
them
then
dances
violently
from
one
depression
of
the
soil
to
another
arching
the
space
between
the
two
at
the
end
of
it
he
fans
out
the
tail
and
stands
looking
defiantly
at
his
rival
who
fans
his
and
returns
the
glance
then
makes
a
little
run
towards
him
sweeping
the
ground
with
it
instead
of
fighting
however
which
both
the
champions
seem
to
be
chary
of
one
of
them
again
runs
into
a
hollow
this
time
a
very
shallow
one
and
begins
to
dance
but
in
a
manner
slightly
different
he
now
hardly
rises
from
the
ground
over
which
he
seems
more
to
spin
in
a
strange
sort
of
way
than
to
fly
to
buzz
as
it
were
in
a
confined
area
and
with
a
tendency
to
go
round
and
round
having
done
this
a
little
he
runs
quickly
from
the
hollow
plucks
a
few
little
bits
of
grass
returns
with
them
into
it
drops
them
there
comes
out
again
hops
about
as
before
flies
up
into
the
air
descends
and
again
dances
about
very
like
the
action
of
the
nightjar
when
disturbed
with
the
young
chicks
at
about
four
the
female
reappears
flying
from
the
warren
towards
the
same
where
she
had
before
sat
she
perches
in
it
again
and
after
remaining
but
a
short
time
flies
down
and
once
more
becomes
invisible
shortly
afterwards
one
of
the
male
birds
flies
to
a
little
distance
but
whether
towards
her
or
not
i
can
not
say
he
then
rises
into
the
air
and
descends
with
a
twittering
song
upon
which
the
other
one
who
has
remained
where
he
was
does
so
too
the
two
are
now
a
good
way
apart
but
the
distance
is
soon
diminished
till
they
are
again
quite
near
when
one
of
them
flies
away
then
turns
and
flies
back
again
and
settles
not
quite
so
near
as
he
does
so
the
other
one
flies
in
an
opposite
direction
and
at
the
end
of
his
flight
rises
into
the
air
with
the
and
descends
when
the
other
immediately
does
the
same
just
as
before
then
again
they
hop
now
this
way
now
that
way
but
always
diminishing
the
distance
till
at
length
not
more
than
some
three
or
four
feet
separates
them
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
and
this
applies
throughout
that
the
birds
seem
to
have
any
sinister
intention
or
even
any
impertinent
curiosity
in
regard
to
each
other
they
do
not
advance
openly
to
the
attack
but
get
to
close
quarters
in
a
very
odd
sort
of
way
seeming
for
the
most
part
to
be
unconscious
of
each
other
presence
hopping
constantly
away
from
and
approaching
one
another
but
obliquely
they
in
reality
dog
each
other
steps
and
keep
a
constant
eye
on
each
other
movements
when
at
length
there
is
but
this
short
space
between
them
they
stand
for
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
yet
without
any
very
warlike
demonstration
then
all
at
once
one
darts
upon
the
other
so
swiftly
that
i
can
not
be
sure
whether
he
flies
hops
or
does
both
and
there
is
now
a
fierce
and
prolonged
fight
for
a
moment
or
two
they
are
in
the
air
though
not
at
any
height
then
struggling
on
the
ground
when
one
getting
uppermost
holds
the
other
down
at
last
they
separate
and
for
a
few
seconds
stand
close
together
as
though
recovering
breath
then
as
by
mutual
consent
they
retire
from
each
other
to
a
short
distance
and
hop
about
again
in
the
same
manner
as
before
one
of
them
then
again
flies
singing
into
the
air
and
on
coming
down
dances
but
to
this
the
other
does
not
respond
and
now
all
goes
on
in
the
usual
way
the
birds
getting
once
or
twice
again
quite
close
but
separating
without
fighting
at
four
there
is
another
twittering
flight
into
the
air
and
a
dance
on
descent
which
is
emulated
in
a
few
minutes
by
the
rival
bird
shortly
afterwards
one
flies
a
considerable
way
off
but
is
followed
almost
at
once
by
the
other
and
the
same
thing
goes
on
then
there
is
another
flight
and
song
with
this
time
no
dance
on
descent
but
as
though
to
make
up
for
this
omission
on
the
next
occasion
which
is
some
few
minutes
afterwards
there
are
two
distinct
transports
on
alighting
separated
by
a
short
interval
on
this
occasion
the
bird
did
not
sing
either
in
ascending
or
descending
here
some
other
birds
claimed
my
attention
and
i
was
away
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
returning
at
a
quarter
to
five
i
found
the
two
wheatears
still
together
and
precisely
the
same
thing
going
on
shortly
after
five
they
again
fought
but
this
time
entirely
in
the
air
they
mounted
fighting
to
a
considerable
height
descended
still
doing
so
and
separated
in
alighting
afterwards
both
of
them
sang
whilst
on
the
ground
and
then
one
mounted
up
still
singing
and
danced
when
he
came
down
at
five
i
could
only
see
one
of
the
birds
and
this
one
i
noticed
to
run
several
times
in
and
out
of
one
of
those
sandy
depressions
i
have
spoken
of
and
which
seem
to
play
such
a
part
in
these
curious
performances
a
little
later
both
of
them
seem
gone
but
now
at
a
quarter
to
six
as
i
am
about
to
follow
their
example
i
again
see
them
in
company
with
the
hen
she
shortly
runs
a
little
away
from
them
the
two
males
remaining
together
but
making
no
further
demonstration
in
a
little
one
of
them
flies
to
her
and
these
two
are
now
in
each
other
company
singing
flying
and
twittering
for
some
ten
minutes
it
would
seem
as
though
she
had
made
her
choice
and
that
this
was
submitted
to
by
the
rejected
bird
but
just
before
leaving
at
six
all
three
are
again
together
it
is
to
be
observed
here
that
these
two
birds
though
they
were
in
active
and
excited
rivalry
for
the
greater
part
of
an
afternoon
and
though
they
made
many
feints
and
as
it
were
endeavours
to
fight
yet
only
really
fought
twice
seeming
indeed
to
have
a
considerable
respect
for
each
other
prowess
and
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
will
during
most
of
the
time
perhaps
they
were
brave
but
the
idea
given
me
by
the
whole
thing
was
that
of
two
cowards
trying
to
work
themselves
up
into
a
sufficient
degree
of
fury
to
overcome
for
a
moment
or
two
their
natural
timidity
willing
to
wound
but
yet
afraid
to
strike
seemed
to
me
to
describe
their
mental
attitude
much
has
been
said
as
to
the
pugnacity
of
birds
but
i
think
that
a
large
amount
of
timidity
often
mingles
with
this
pugnacity
even
in
the
most
pugnacious
kinds
i
have
seen
for
instance
two
pheasants
sit
first
face
to
face
pecking
timidly
at
or
rather
towards
each
other
and
then
on
rising
make
various
little
feints
and
runs
one
at
another
as
though
trying
to
fight
and
not
being
able
to
and
this
for
quite
a
long
time
at
last
one
of
them
ran
to
some
distance
away
and
then
turning
made
a
most
tremendous
fiery
rush
down
upon
the
other
one
like
a
knight
in
the
nothing
could
have
looked
bolder
more
spirited
more
full
of
fire
and
fury
but
just
like
these
wheatears
at
the
very
moment
that
he
should
have
hurled
himself
upon
his
foe
he
swerved
timidly
aside
and
all
his
brave
carriage
was
gone
in
a
moment
and
what
struck
me
and
indeed
as
humorous
was
that
this
other
bird
the
one
thus
charged
down
upon
who
had
been
just
as
timid
and
had
seemed
to
find
fighting
equally
difficult
did
not
retreat
as
one
might
have
expected
before
this
great
show
but
sat
quietly
as
knowing
it
to
be
indeed
but
show
and
that
there
was
nothing
really
to
fear
in
fact
it
was
like
the
drawing
of
swords
between
nym
and
pistol
in
each
being
afraid
to
use
his
and
knowing
the
other
to
be
so
too
again
are
often
very
ready
to
avoid
a
conflict
and
dance
much
more
fiercely
than
they
fight
a
bird
indeed
which
is
a
very
demon
in
the
spiel
or
may
as
i
have
seen
become
meek
and
retreat
from
it
upon
the
entry
of
another
which
other
is
then
of
course
the
boldest
bird
in
existence
blackbirds
are
considered
to
be
quarrelsome
and
i
know
that
even
the
hens
or
perhaps
they
especially
will
sometimes
fight
in
the
most
vindictive
manner
but
as
with
these
wheatears
i
have
seen
in
the
case
of
rival
cock
blackbirds
a
great
deal
of
chariness
of
real
fighting
mingle
with
much
ostentation
of
being
ready
to
fight
whereas
the
thrush
it
is
usually
added
is
peaceable
but
this
is
one
of
those
things
with
which
natural
history
is
burdened
from
my
own
experience
i
know
it
to
be
otherwise
i
have
watched
thrushes
fighting
furiously
not
only
with
one
another
but
with
the
blackbird
also
i
am
not
of
course
disputing
the
pugnacity
of
birds
during
the
breeding
season
and
often
at
other
times
that
is
quite
beyond
doubt
and
proofs
or
instances
of
it
are
altogether
superfluous
but
the
pugnacity
is
all
the
greater
if
in
order
for
it
to
assert
itself
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
timidity
varying
of
course
in
different
species
and
individuals
must
first
be
overcome
assuming
that
this
is
sometimes
the
case
and
i
know
not
how
else
such
instances
as
i
have
given
are
to
be
explained
is
it
so
unlikely
that
rival
birds
wishing
to
fight
yet
half
afraid
to
and
being
thus
in
a
state
of
great
nervous
tension
should
fall
into
certain
violent
or
frenzied
movements
into
little
paroxysms
of
fury
as
when
a
man
is
popularly
said
to
dance
with
rage
anything
that
excites
highly
tends
to
exalt
the
courage
and
conquer
fear
as
we
know
with
our
own
martial
music
to
say
nothing
of
the
pyrrhic
and
other
dances
it
seems
possible
therefore
that
such
violent
movements
as
are
here
imagined
might
have
this
effect
and
thus
though
excited
originally
by
rage
or
some
high
state
of
emotion
only
might
be
persisted
in
and
increased
through
experience
of
their
efficacy
but
if
this
does
ever
happen
may
we
not
have
here
the
origin
or
one
of
the
origins
of
those
undoubted
displays
made
by
the
male
bird
to
the
female
on
which
the
theory
of
sexual
selection
is
chiefly
based
that
the
male
birds
should
in
the
beginning
have
consciously
displayed
their
plumage
in
however
slight
a
manner
to
the
females
with
an
idea
of
it
striking
them
seems
improbable
and
even
if
we
might
assume
the
intelligence
requisite
for
this
the
theory
of
sexual
selection
supposes
the
beauty
of
the
plumage
to
have
been
gained
by
the
display
of
it
not
that
the
display
has
been
founded
upon
the
beauty
then
what
should
first
lead
a
bird
of
dull
plumage
consciously
to
display
this
plumage
before
the
female
a
mere
habit
of
the
male
increased
and
perfected
by
the
selective
agency
of
the
female
as
this
is
explained
by
darwin
has
hitherto
as
far
as
i
know
been
considered
a
sufficient
explanation
of
the
origin
and
early
stages
of
such
displays
as
are
now
made
by
the
great
bustard
the
various
birds
of
paradise
or
the
argus
pheasant
but
if
we
can
show
a
likelihood
as
to
how
this
habit
has
arisen
we
are
at
least
a
step
farther
forward
even
if
a
slight
difficulty
has
not
thereby
been
removed
now
with
regard
to
these
wheatears
it
will
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
little
frenzies
of
the
male
birds
as
i
have
described
them
were
of
a
very
marked
and
indeed
extraordinary
nature
and
also
perhaps
that
it
is
more
easy
to
look
upon
them
as
sudden
bursts
of
excitement
or
emotional
whirlwinds
so
to
speak
than
as
displays
intended
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
female
bird
certainly
there
was
nothing
like
a
set
display
of
the
plumage
and
with
regard
to
the
female
the
question
arises
where
was
she
at
least
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
the
two
male
birds
in
the
course
of
their
drama
got
over
a
considerable
amount
of
ground
and
constantly
flew
from
one
part
to
another
so
that
in
order
to
have
had
anything
like
a
good
view
the
female
must
have
accompanied
them
and
i
must
then
perforce
have
seen
her
which
i
did
not
except
on
the
occasions
related
she
was
therefore
not
with
them
and
if
watching
them
at
all
could
only
have
been
doing
so
from
such
a
distance
that
the
dancings
of
the
male
birds
would
have
been
very
much
thrown
away
yet
that
she
took
some
interest
in
what
was
going
on
appears
likely
from
her
flying
up
twice
into
the
willow
tree
during
its
continuance
and
being
with
the
two
rivals
at
the
end
of
the
day
she
might
too
have
been
listening
to
the
song
and
observing
the
flights
up
into
the
air
which
would
have
been
much
more
noticeable
from
a
distance
one
might
expect
a
female
bird
to
take
interest
in
two
male
ones
fighting
for
her
merely
without
any
adjunct
and
if
they
added
to
the
fighting
peculiar
violent
movements
such
as
those
here
described
that
interest
would
tend
to
become
increased
now
i
can
imagine
that
with
this
material
of
violent
motions
on
the
one
side
and
some
amount
of
interested
curiosity
on
the
other
the
former
might
gradually
come
to
be
a
display
made
entirely
for
the
female
and
the
latter
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
of
pleasurable
excitement
raised
by
it
with
a
choice
in
accordance
which
is
sexual
selection
and
that
the
display
would
come
at
last
to
be
made
intelligently
and
with
a
view
to
a
proposed
end
as
in
the
case
supposed
of
the
female
wild
duck
or
other
bird
diverting
attention
from
its
young
i
can
also
understand
in
both
instances
mere
nervous
movements
due
to
a
high
state
of
excitement
would
have
been
directed
into
a
certain
channel
and
then
perfected
by
the
agency
either
of
natural
or
sexual
selection
on
this
view
the
curiosity
passing
insensibly
into
interest
and
satisfaction
of
the
female
bird
would
have
been
directed
at
first
not
to
the
plumage
but
to
the
frenzied
actions
the
antics
of
the
male
and
he
on
his
part
would
have
first
consciously
displayed
only
these
from
this
to
the
more
refined
appreciation
of
colours
and
patterns
may
have
been
a
very
gradual
process
but
one
can
understand
the
one
growing
out
of
the
other
for
waving
plumes
and
fluttering
wings
would
still
be
action
and
action
is
emphasised
by
colour
where
however
such
movements
had
not
been
seized
upon
and
controlled
by
the
latter
of
these
two
powers
sexual
selection
and
there
is
no
necessity
that
they
should
be
we
should
have
antics
not
in
the
nature
of
sexual
display
properly
speaking
but
which
might
yet
bear
a
greater
or
less
resemblance
to
such
that
this
is
in
fact
the
case
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
opponents
of
sexual
selection
and
often
as
if
it
were
evidence
against
it
though
no
one
unfortunately
can
point
to
men
as
a
ground
for
disbelief
in
armies
mr
hudson
for
instance
in
his
very
interesting
work
the
naturalist
in
la
plata
after
bringing
forward
a
number
of
cases
of
curious
or
of
song
performed
by
birds
and
which
are
in
his
opinion
not
to
be
explained
on
the
theory
of
sexual
selection
says
in
regard
to
other
cases
brought
forward
by
darwin
in
support
of
that
theory
how
unfair
the
argument
is
based
on
these
carefully
selected
cases
gathered
from
all
regions
of
the
globe
and
often
not
properly
reported
is
seen
when
we
turn
from
the
book
to
nature
and
closely
consider
the
habits
and
actions
of
all
the
species
inhabiting
any
district
but
from
book
not
i
suppose
from
darwin
alone
now
had
darwin
been
of
opinion
that
antics
performed
by
a
bird
which
could
not
or
could
not
easily
be
explained
by
his
theory
were
fatal
to
it
in
other
cases
if
he
had
thought
that
the
one
was
inconsistent
with
the
other
then
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
unfair
on
his
part
to
have
marshalled
the
affirmative
evidence
without
concerning
himself
with
the
negative
but
why
should
he
have
held
that
view
or
on
what
good
grounds
can
such
a
view
be
maintained
as
well
might
it
be
argued
so
it
appears
to
me
that
woollen
or
other
goods
could
only
have
been
produced
through
the
action
of
the
loom
or
some
such
special
machinery
but
let
the
wool
be
there
and
it
can
be
worked
up
in
various
ways
mr
hudson
would
account
for
all
such
displays
or
exhibitions
by
a
universal
joyous
instinct
present
throughout
nature
but
to
which
birds
are
more
subject
than
mammals
i
do
not
dispute
the
instinct
or
rather
perhaps
the
emotion
or
that
some
of
the
displays
in
question
may
be
due
to
it
simply
and
solely
but
i
can
not
believe
that
all
are
why
should
this
be
the
case
or
how
can
movements
which
are
often
of
a
complex
and
elaborate
nature
be
explained
solely
by
reference
to
some
large
general
factor
such
as
joy
or
vital
energy
these
may
lie
at
the
root
of
all
but
something
else
some
more
special
process
is
i
think
in
many
cases
required
one
would
not
be
content
to
explain
all
the
phenomena
of
history
by
a
reference
to
human
nature
and
though
it
may
be
true
as
the
kaffirs
say
that
in
a
there
can
only
be
one
bull
yet
nature
is
a
good
deal
larger
than
a
i
believe
myself
that
various
antics
which
are
performed
by
birds
have
grown
out
of
various
nervous
excited
or
automatic
movements
arising
under
the
influence
of
various
special
causes
two
such
possible
causes
viz
sudden
alarm
whilst
incubating
and
paroxysms
of
rage
or
nervous
excitement
during
rivalry
for
the
female
i
have
already
indicated
two
other
possible
ones
have
also
been
suggested
to
me
by
some
of
my
observations
and
i
will
now
by
the
aid
of
these
make
an
attempt
i
daresay
a
lame
one
to
throw
light
on
the
possible
origin
of
a
very
extraordinary
case
of
described
by
mr
hudson
in
the
work
i
have
mentioned
and
which
is
believed
by
him
to
be
unique
the
bird
in
question
is
the
lapwing
and
the
following
is
mr
hudson
account
of
its
performances
if
a
person
watches
any
two
birds
for
some
time
for
they
live
in
pairs
he
will
see
another
lapwing
one
of
a
neighbouring
couple
rise
up
and
fly
to
them
leaving
his
own
mate
to
guard
their
chosen
ground
and
instead
of
resenting
this
visit
as
an
unwarranted
intrusion
on
their
domain
as
they
would
certainly
resent
the
approach
of
almost
any
other
bird
they
welcome
it
with
notes
and
signs
of
pleasure
advancing
to
the
visitor
they
place
themselves
behind
it
then
all
three
keeping
step
begin
a
rapid
march
uttering
resonant
drumming
notes
in
time
with
their
movements
the
notes
of
the
pair
behind
being
emitted
in
a
stream
like
a
while
the
leader
utters
loud
single
notes
at
regular
intervals
the
march
ceases
the
leader
elevates
his
wings
and
stands
erect
and
motionless
still
uttering
loud
notes
while
the
other
two
with
plumage
and
standing
exactly
abreast
stoop
forward
and
downward
until
the
tips
of
their
beaks
touch
the
ground
and
sinking
their
rhythmical
voices
to
a
murmur
remain
for
some
time
in
this
position
the
performance
is
then
over
and
the
visitor
goes
back
to
his
own
ground
and
mate
to
receive
a
visitor
himself
later
on
now
the
most
curious
point
in
this
remarkable
performance
so
well
described
is
that
three
birds
a
pair
male
and
female
and
one
other
whether
male
or
female
is
not
stated
take
part
in
it
and
how
is
this
fundamental
peculiarity
to
be
explained
better
on
the
theory
of
a
universal
joyous
instinct
than
on
that
of
sexual
selection
if
indeed
the
former
one
helps
us
so
well
joy
no
doubt
is
there
but
something
else
some
shaping
force
is
surely
required
to
account
for
the
particular
form
in
which
it
finds
expression
now
with
regard
to
the
peculiarity
pointed
out
the
odd
bird
though
all
act
oddly
i
have
whilst
watching
birds
in
the
early
spring
been
struck
by
the
frequency
with
which
three
of
the
same
species
will
be
seen
in
each
other
company
usually
chasing
one
another
about
and
as
with
the
lapwing
these
three
are
almost
always
made
up
of
a
pair
a
male
and
female
and
another
bird
a
male
as
i
believe
it
may
be
said
that
here
there
can
be
no
analogy
for
that
it
is
either
merely
a
case
of
two
males
courting
one
female
or
that
the
odd
male
is
both
a
rival
and
intruder
endeavouring
to
come
between
the
married
happiness
of
two
who
have
made
their
choice
this
latter
explanation
is
the
one
that
has
generally
seemed
to
me
to
meet
the
case
but
what
i
have
frequently
noticed
with
surprise
is
that
the
state
of
anger
or
indeed
fury
which
one
might
imagine
would
obtain
under
such
circumstances
between
the
two
male
birds
is
either
wholly
absent
or
very
much
subdued
now
it
is
in
the
case
of
our
own
peewit
more
than
with
any
other
species
that
i
have
noticed
this
quite
amicable
association
of
three
birds
two
of
which
would
often
seem
to
be
a
paired
couple
and
as
my
notes
made
whilst
i
had
the
birds
under
observation
both
illustrate
the
point
and
contain
the
explanation
of
it
which
i
have
to
offer
i
will
here
quote
from
them
three
peewits
in
company
with
each
other
two
are
flying
close
together
as
though
they
were
a
paired
couple
whilst
one
follows
them
at
a
short
interval
three
peewits
flying
together
in
the
same
way
as
before
that
is
to
say
two
which
may
be
paired
birds
are
close
together
whilst
there
is
commonly
a
short
space
between
them
and
the
third
one
this
arrangement
may
be
temporarily
suspended
or
reversed
by
the
bird
that
has
been
separated
getting
up
to
the
other
two
when
one
of
these
will
often
fall
behind
so
that
now
the
bird
which
was
the
follower
makes
one
of
the
two
advanced
ones
whilst
one
of
these
has
taken
its
place
as
there
is
no
sexual
distinction
in
the
plumage
of
peewits
it
is
impossible
to
be
quite
sure
to
what
sex
each
of
these
birds
belongs
but
i
believe
that
two
of
them
are
male
and
female
and
the
third
a
male
either
of
the
two
males
being
alternately
in
the
close
company
of
the
female
this
indeed
may
be
in
the
nature
of
the
matter
the
pairing
off
of
the
birds
we
will
suppose
as
is
likely
at
this
time
is
not
yet
completed
and
assuming
two
of
the
three
to
be
of
one
sex
it
may
not
be
quite
settled
with
which
of
them
the
third
will
pair
it
is
not
indeed
necessary
to
suppose
that
either
of
the
three
will
eventually
pair
with
one
of
the
others
though
this
may
be
probable
but
what
appears
to
me
to
obtain
is
this
that
the
association
of
two
birds
male
and
female
together
has
a
tendency
to
bring
up
a
third
presumably
a
male
who
envies
this
arrangement
and
would
fain
itself
make
one
of
the
two
but
how
then
is
the
amicableness
or
at
any
rate
the
absence
of
any
marked
evidence
of
hostility
to
be
accounted
for
i
believe
that
at
this
early
season
the
sexual
feelings
have
not
yet
become
fully
developed
or
so
strong
as
to
produce
jealousy
to
any
active
extent
things
are
only
beginning
the
emotions
are
as
yet
in
their
infancy
and
thus
i
believe
the
curious
not
fully
defined
nature
of
the
actions
of
the
three
birds
their
seeming
to
be
half
unconscious
of
what
they
really
want
or
mean
may
be
accounted
for
as
the
season
advances
the
tendency
will
be
more
and
more
for
the
two
birds
but
i
here
speak
of
birds
generally
to
avoid
or
actively
to
drive
away
the
third
and
for
the
third
to
find
another
bird
for
a
partner
the
whole
being
tempered
by
the
character
both
of
the
species
of
bird
and
the
individual
birds
belonging
to
it
the
three
birds
being
thus
brought
together
without
the
feelings
being
of
a
very
strong
or
defined
character
and
the
feelings
of
animals
generally
being
as
i
believe
they
are
of
a
very
plastic
nature
by
which
i
mean
that
they
pass
easily
from
one
channel
into
another
i
can
understand
a
sort
of
sport
or
game
of
three
birds
together
arising
at
first
almost
imperceptible
till
by
the
fundamental
laws
of
evolution
variation
and
inheritance
it
might
pass
into
something
highly
peculiar
as
in
the
case
of
the
lapwing
for
though
such
sport
might
commence
in
the
air
there
would
be
no
reason
why
it
should
not
pass
from
thence
on
to
the
ground
and
that
the
number
should
be
three
and
not
more
is
thus
also
explained
for
whilst
the
sight
of
a
paired
male
and
female
bird
would
be
likely
to
excite
the
sexual
feelings
even
though
as
here
supposed
somewhat
languid
of
another
male
so
as
to
make
it
join
them
three
together
would
hardly
have
this
effect
in
an
equal
degree
and
moreover
more
than
three
would
tend
to
become
a
flock
when
other
feelings
would
come
into
play
however
this
may
be
i
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
been
struck
with
the
frequency
with
which
in
the
early
spring
three
birds
will
keep
together
as
and
in
the
manner
before
stated
for
ordinary
field
observation
at
least
this
it
will
be
observed
was
written
at
a
time
of
year
when
peewits
are
only
beginning
their
nuptial
antics
though
as
to
their
having
begun
them
there
is
no
doubt
as
i
had
carefully
noted
this
at
a
still
earlier
date
but
long
subsequent
to
this
and
when
the
theory
of
a
not
fully
developed
state
of
the
sexual
feelings
could
no
longer
be
tenable
as
an
explanation
of
i
noticed
or
thought
i
noticed
a
more
than
usual
tendency
in
this
species
for
a
single
bird
to
project
itself
so
to
speak
into
the
midst
of
a
married
pair
and
for
its
presence
not
to
be
resented
but
rather
otherwise
if
this
be
really
so
for
of
course
i
may
be
deceived
it
is
interesting
and
perhaps
assists
the
suggestion
which
i
have
offered
as
to
the
origin
of
the
astonishing
conduct
of
the
lapwing
the
two
being
such
near
relations
when
the
habit
had
once
commenced
it
might
continue
and
become
fixed
irrespective
of
season
but
it
may
be
said
that
all
the
evidence
which
i
here
bring
forward
is
of
three
birds
being
together
and
that
there
is
none
as
to
any
sport
or
antic
of
however
incipient
or
rudimentary
a
nature
i
have
however
often
seen
peewits
sport
and
wanton
in
the
air
in
threes
but
i
admit
that
more
evidence
in
this
direction
is
wanted
the
little
that
i
have
and
will
here
give
relates
not
to
the
peewit
but
to
two
birds
very
different
both
to
it
and
to
each
other
the
first
of
these
is
that
attractive
and
delightful
little
creature
the
dabchick
or
little
grebe
a
bird
whose
society
i
have
always
cultivated
to
the
best
of
my
ability
my
first
note
taken
on
december
i
give
merely
by
way
of
showing
that
sexual
feelings
in
birds
may
not
always
lie
entirely
dormant
even
in
the
depth
of
winter
for
from
having
long
watched
the
same
birds
in
the
same
little
reedy
creek
i
feel
sure
that
the
two
i
here
chronicle
were
male
and
female
these
were
pursuing
each
other
first
over
the
water
along
the
surface
in
their
peculiar
way
then
on
and
under
it
ducking
coming
up
close
together
ducking
again
and
so
on
flapping
ducking
and
swimming
each
in
turn
it
is
very
sustained
and
animated
suggesting
an
amorous
pursuit
of
the
female
by
the
male
even
at
this
time
of
year
they
make
a
great
noise
and
splashing
they
are
obstreperous
and
a
hen
standing
staidly
on
some
bent
reeds
gives
a
look
as
though
doubtful
of
the
strict
propriety
of
such
conduct
in
the
winter
then
with
an
well
dabchicks
will
be
dabchicks
i
suppose
at
all
times
resigns
herself
to
the
inevitable
and
takes
to
preening
her
feathers
in
the
other
case
which
is
the
one
that
bears
more
directly
on
the
question
under
discussion
three
dabchicks
pursued
each
other
in
this
manner
one
behind
the
other
and
following
the
course
of
the
stream
the
last
bird
was
particularly
energetic
and
seemed
determined
to
interfere
with
the
pursuit
of
the
foremost
by
the
one
just
in
front
of
him
when
quite
near
me
they
all
three
pitch
down
and
instantly
dive
the
first
to
come
up
stops
dead
still
on
the
water
looking
keenly
and
expectantly
over
it
his
neck
stretched
rigidly
out
his
head
darting
forward
from
it
at
a
right
angle
as
rigid
as
the
neck
the
instant
another
one
appears
he
dives
again
with
a
suddenness
as
of
the
lid
of
a
box
going
down
with
a
snap
and
this
other
one
has
seen
him
at
the
same
time
and
dives
still
more
quickly
if
that
were
possible
so
quickly
that
there
is
just
a
swirl
on
the
water
the
appearance
seems
part
of
the
disappearance
nothing
is
but
what
is
not
and
this
as
i
think
continues
but
owing
to
the
rapid
progress
of
the
birds
under
the
water
and
their
getting
amongst
flags
and
weeds
i
never
have
an
equally
sight
of
it
now
here
on
the
february
we
have
as
in
the
case
of
the
peewits
three
birds
together
all
in
pursuit
of
each
other
but
two
as
it
appeared
to
me
in
a
little
more
intimate
association
and
the
third
seeming
to
wish
to
a
third
they
chase
each
other
excitedly
down
the
stream
for
a
little
then
all
pitch
down
upon
it
and
dive
and
one
upon
coming
up
dives
again
at
the
merest
sight
of
another
who
behaves
similarly
a
peculiarly
set
and
rigid
attitude
being
adopted
by
the
waiting
bird
is
this
not
something
like
a
little
romp
or
following
on
the
excitement
of
the
chase
true
it
may
have
been
fighting
between
the
two
males
for
dabchicks
like
the
great
crested
grebe
and
other
probably
fight
by
diving
and
attacking
each
other
beneath
the
surface
to
my
eyes
however
it
had
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
romp
or
at
any
rate
a
something
betwixt
sport
and
earnest
assuming
it
to
have
been
so
then
here
is
a
habit
of
a
sport
or
antic
between
three
birds
at
the
end
of
an
excited
chase
of
each
other
now
supposing
this
habit
to
increase
then
as
the
birds
became
more
enamoured
of
their
little
sport
as
it
became
more
and
more
a
fixed
habit
with
them
is
it
not
likely
that
the
preliminary
chase
before
the
romp
began
would
be
thrown
more
and
more
into
the
background
the
more
one
enjoys
a
thing
the
more
eager
is
one
to
begin
it
and
as
here
the
longer
the
chase
lasted
the
longer
must
the
romp
at
the
end
be
postponed
the
tendency
would
be
for
the
former
to
become
shortened
and
shortened
till
at
length
it
ceased
altogether
the
approach
of
the
one
bird
getting
to
be
associated
in
the
minds
of
the
other
two
with
the
sport
or
game
alone
in
the
final
stage
this
last
might
be
extraordinary
in
a
high
degree
but
every
trace
of
its
origin
as
here
suggested
would
have
vanished
and
so
strongly
might
the
habit
or
instinct
of
thus
romping
be
now
implanted
that
one
of
any
pair
of
birds
would
be
ready
to
join
any
other
pair
and
they
to
receive
him
in
order
to
indulge
in
it
i
can
indeed
see
no
reason
why
birds
that
sported
well
should
succeed
in
life
better
than
others
but
if
such
sporting
were
an
outcome
of
general
vigour
and
vigorous
birds
were
selected
their
sportings
would
be
selected
also
and
that
movements
of
this
sort
would
tend
sooner
or
later
if
only
by
mere
preference
to
fall
into
some
sort
of
form
also
seems
not
unlikely
it
will
be
remembered
that
what
i
have
just
recounted
took
place
early
in
february
whereas
the
dabchick
does
not
in
my
experience
commonly
build
before
may
one
would
not
at
so
early
a
period
expect
to
find
the
jealous
and
combative
feelings
of
the
male
in
regard
to
the
female
bird
fully
awake
but
if
there
were
apt
to
be
occasional
sudden
outbursts
of
this
little
inducing
appropriate
action
for
a
few
moments
and
then
passing
quickly
away
the
birds
might
be
left
as
it
were
surprised
at
themselves
and
not
quite
knowing
what
had
started
them
off
the
originating
cause
would
have
ceased
or
subsided
but
the
excitation
consequent
on
the
bodily
activity
which
had
been
thus
aroused
would
require
a
further
outlet
and
this
might
pass
in
time
into
some
prescribed
play
or
antic
which
might
afterwards
be
indulged
in
for
its
own
sake
my
other
instance
is
that
of
the
if
anyone
will
watch
these
birds
closely
he
may
see
three
of
them
go
through
a
performance
bearing
the
same
sort
of
resemblance
to
that
of
the
lapwing
that
the
combs
of
the
do
to
the
more
perfect
ones
of
the
he
may
see
for
instance
two
standing
side
by
side
with
their
heads
bent
forwards
and
downwards
as
the
two
lapwings
bend
theirs
though
here
the
length
of
the
brilliant
bills
the
tips
of
which
also
almost
touch
the
ground
make
the
angle
of
inclination
a
much
lesser
one
in
this
attitude
they
both
of
them
utter
a
long
continuous
piping
note
of
a
very
powerful
and
penetrative
quality
sometimes
swaying
their
heads
from
side
to
side
as
though
in
ecstasy
at
their
own
performance
and
seeming
to
listen
intently
in
a
manner
strongly
suggestive
of
the
musical
connoisseur
the
third
bird
who
is
obviously
the
female
either
stands
or
walks
at
a
short
distance
from
the
two
pipers
who
will
frequently
follow
and
press
upon
her
and
then
though
the
march
is
not
quite
so
formal
and
regular
it
yet
bears
for
a
few
moments
a
considerable
resemblance
to
that
of
the
lapwing
as
described
and
figured
in
mr
hudson
work
of
course
there
is
really
no
march
at
all
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
but
there
is
the
occasional
resemblance
and
the
resemblance
suggests
the
origin
in
the
case
of
the
lapwing
the
play
is
commenced
by
one
bird
of
a
pair
flying
to
another
pair
and
thus
making
the
trio
there
is
the
same
kind
of
rough
and
imperfect
resemblance
to
this
in
the
way
in
which
these
trios
commonly
open
but
as
an
account
of
what
i
actually
saw
may
give
a
better
idea
of
how
the
birds
act
than
can
a
mere
generalisation
i
will
illustrate
the
last
point
as
well
as
those
others
which
i
have
mentioned
by
this
means
when
one
of
the
male
birds
standing
near
the
female
commences
thus
to
pipe
the
other
one
if
on
the
same
rock
runs
excitedly
up
to
him
and
pushing
him
out
of
the
way
so
as
to
occupy
almost
his
exact
place
pipes
himself
as
though
he
would
do
so
instead
of
him
the
other
however
is
not
to
be
silenced
but
standing
close
by
him
the
two
pipe
together
throwing
their
heads
from
time
to
time
in
each
other
direction
and
then
back
again
in
a
frenzy
or
ecstasy
as
though
they
were
highland
bagpipers
of
rival
clans
piping
against
each
other
and
swinging
their
instruments
as
they
grew
inspired
by
their
strains
continuing
thus
to
act
the
two
male
birds
approach
and
press
upon
the
female
she
flies
to
a
corner
of
the
rock
the
two
still
piping
vigorously
follow
and
again
press
upon
her
she
flies
down
upon
a
lower
ledge
of
it
the
two
pipe
down
at
her
from
above
she
flies
from
the
rock
they
half
raise
their
heads
and
cease
to
pipe
then
with
single
querulous
notes
and
in
their
ordinary
attitude
walk
disconsolately
about
after
some
ten
minutes
the
female
flies
back
again
the
demeanour
of
the
two
birds
is
at
once
visibly
affected
and
they
begin
to
pipe
again
though
not
so
vigorously
as
before
they
continue
to
do
so
more
or
less
at
intervals
the
third
bird
the
female
remaining
always
passive
and
never
once
piping
all
at
once
one
of
the
two
pipers
flies
violently
at
the
other
who
flies
off
and
is
closely
pursued
by
him
they
alight
it
would
seem
together
on
the
edge
of
a
great
rocky
slab
but
are
instantly
at
some
little
distance
apart
looking
at
each
other
and
bearing
themselves
after
the
manner
of
rivals
how
they
separated
whether
as
recoiling
from
a
conflict
or
avoiding
it
i
can
not
now
say
the
movements
of
birds
are
often
so
quick
that
the
eye
though
it
may
follow
forgets
them
as
they
pass
on
another
occasion
a
bird
close
to
where
i
sit
on
hearing
the
pipe
from
a
rock
a
little
off
the
shore
becomes
excited
pipes
for
a
moment
itself
and
then
darts
off
to
the
rock
on
alighting
he
instantly
runs
to
the
piping
bird
and
the
two
pipe
together
to
a
third
exactly
as
before
this
third
one
silent
and
unresponsive
soon
flies
away
the
piping
instantly
ceases
and
the
two
birds
assume
normal
attitudes
the
note
of
the
male
when
thus
courting
the
female
differs
both
from
its
ordinary
one
and
as
i
think
from
that
of
the
female
the
usual
note
is
a
loud
wich
wich
or
some
similar
sharp
penetrative
cry
constantly
reiterated
the
pipe
is
a
much
more
wonderful
affair
and
though
harsh
is
like
a
real
composition
it
is
of
long
continuance
beginning
with
something
like
kee
kee
kee
a
loud
and
clamour
gradually
however
it
sinks
becoming
in
its
later
stages
quite
faint
and
ending
commonly
in
a
sort
of
quavering
trill
which
the
bird
seems
to
pause
upon
with
pleasure
holding
down
its
head
all
the
time
it
seems
to
drink
in
every
tittle
of
the
sound
and
to
strive
to
give
it
its
full
and
just
expression
so
much
has
it
whilst
doing
this
the
appearance
of
a
musician
and
so
much
does
the
long
straight
orange
bill
resemble
a
pipe
it
is
playing
on
that
if
fingers
were
to
appear
there
of
a
sudden
and
begin
to
the
stops
one
would
hardly
feel
surprise
for
a
moment
or
two
a
point
to
be
noted
is
that
the
piping
bird
is
not
always
turned
towards
the
female
he
is
courting
even
when
close
beside
her
he
turns
towards
her
commonly
perhaps
always
when
he
begins
but
having
once
begun
he
seems
more
enthralled
by
his
own
music
than
by
her
and
will
turn
from
side
to
side
or
even
right
round
and
away
from
her
as
though
in
the
rhythmical
sway
of
his
piping
here
then
at
last
we
have
upon
our
own
shores
and
amongst
our
own
birds
an
unmistakable
case
of
a
display
or
performance
of
a
very
marked
character
in
which
three
birds
are
present
though
one
takes
only
a
passive
part
the
motive
power
here
is
obviously
sexual
two
males
are
at
least
to
all
appearance
courting
one
female
but
i
made
at
the
time
this
special
observation
that
though
the
rival
birds
did
upon
two
occasions
fly
at
each
other
and
though
the
piping
of
one
always
brought
the
other
over
to
him
to
pipe
in
rivalry
yet
when
once
they
began
to
pipe
vigorously
their
interest
seemed
to
become
centred
in
and
as
it
were
abstracted
into
this
the
actual
display
in
this
case
vocal
seemed
to
have
become
or
to
be
in
process
of
becoming
of
more
importance
than
the
emotion
which
had
given
birth
to
it
the
essence
seemed
merged
into
the
form
the
book
had
become
its
binding
i
suggest
that
this
may
be
sometimes
actually
the
case
in
nature
that
a
movement
or
a
note
or
series
of
notes
may
become
itself
so
as
to
demand
the
whole
consciousness
of
the
bird
who
in
performing
it
forgets
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
the
performance
let
this
process
once
commence
and
certain
movements
antics
performed
at
first
with
a
definite
object
might
be
gone
through
at
last
for
themselves
alone
the
object
having
become
now
merely
to
perform
them
in
this
case
we
should
have
a
pure
antic
or
display
the
reason
of
it
being
unobvious
and
its
origin
a
puzzle
such
a
principle
if
it
exists
might
perhaps
be
called
the
law
of
the
formalisation
of
actions
once
purposive
which
sounds
learned
enough
and
perhaps
traces
of
it
may
be
seen
amongst
ourselves
what
for
instance
are
our
civilised
dances
except
movements
which
have
become
quite
formal
and
meaningless
but
which
once
as
in
the
of
the
savage
had
an
intense
significance
the
analogy
is
not
quite
perfect
unless
we
could
show
that
actual
war
for
instance
had
sometimes
passed
into
a
dance
whether
this
has
ever
been
the
case
with
man
i
do
not
know
but
i
believe
that
it
may
have
actually
happened
with
some
birds
for
which
idea
i
will
further
on
adduce
my
perhaps
somewhat
slender
evidence
but
coming
back
to
the
i
can
understand
that
under
such
a
law
as
this
the
actions
of
the
two
male
birds
in
regard
to
the
female
might
gradually
get
to
be
of
a
quite
formal
and
nature
and
though
i
will
not
here
try
to
indicate
the
steps
by
which
the
female
bird
might
gradually
enter
into
the
or
the
song
they
do
not
seem
to
me
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
number
of
performers
however
having
once
become
fixed
would
be
likely
to
continue
through
habit
as
long
as
no
other
influence
arose
to
affect
it
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
early
days
of
july
when
the
true
should
have
been
over
that
i
witnessed
these
movements
may
perhaps
strengthen
the
above
view
in
seeking
to
explain
such
performances
as
those
of
the
lapwing
in
this
latter
way
one
must
assume
the
number
of
three
birds
to
have
originated
in
accordance
with
general
principles
and
that
first
there
has
been
a
real
courtship
of
the
female
bird
by
two
males
the
antics
proper
to
which
have
at
last
become
stereotyped
into
a
formal
dance
or
display
this
however
would
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
what
i
have
suggested
in
the
case
of
the
dabchicks
and
common
peewit
and
i
believe
myself
that
it
is
not
by
one
only
but
by
many
causes
that
the
many
curious
antics
of
birds
are
to
be
explained

chapter
v
watching
gulls
and
skuas
the
brings
us
to
the
sea
so
to
i
will
consecrate
the
next
few
chapters
gulls
and
skuas
are
best
watched
on
some
lonely
island
where
they
breed
and
thither
we
will
now
transfer
ourselves
they
breed
together
or
more
strictly
speaking
conterminously
and
more
than
half
of
the
whole
island
all
that
part
where
it
is
a
peaty
waste
clothed
with
a
thin
brown
heather
is
now
in
early
june
their
assembly
ground
and
prospective
nursery
the
gulls
are
in
much
the
greater
numbers
and
all
of
them
here
are
of
the
species
mostly
the
lesser
of
the
two
so
named
but
with
a
fair
sprinkling
of
the
greater
also
lying
down
and
sweeping
the
distance
with
the
glasses
for
near
they
have
risen
and
float
overhead
in
a
clamorous
cloud
one
sees
everywhere
the
bright
white
dottings
of
their
breasts
amidst
the
uniform
brown
of
the
heather
they
are
not
at
all
crowded
but
scattered
widely
about
at
irregular
and
for
the
most
part
considerable
intervals
there
is
rarely
a
group
and
though
many
pairs
may
be
seen
standing
closely
together
yet
this
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
most
birds
of
such
pairs
as
are
present
are
some
three
or
four
to
a
dozen
or
twenty
yards
apart
whilst
the
greater
number
of
the
whole
assembly
stand
singly
the
bird
nearest
to
each
at
a
much
greater
distance
being
one
of
another
pair
this
is
because
the
partner
birds
are
for
the
time
being
absent
but
every
now
and
again
one
may
be
seen
to
fly
up
and
join
the
solitary
one
whilst
similarly
one
of
a
couple
will
from
time
to
time
fly
off
and
leave
the
other
alone
thus
though
the
eye
will
distinguish
at
any
time
many
paired
couples
to
the
majority
of
the
birds
it
will
not
be
able
to
assign
a
partner
with
certainty
but
this
varies
very
much
on
some
occasions
there
will
be
many
more
close
couples
than
on
others
and
it
is
when
this
is
the
case
that
the
gullery
has
the
most
pleasing
appearance
here
and
there
one
sees
a
bird
not
standing
but
couched
closely
down
amidst
the
heather
these
birds
have
laid
and
are
now
hatching
their
eggs
for
the
most
part
they
are
alone
but
as
the
season
advances
and
they
become
more
and
more
numerous
the
partner
may
often
be
seen
standing
near
the
nest
and
presenting
every
appearance
of
a
joint
interest
and
proprietorship
in
it
when
a
bird
flies
up
to
its
partner
it
usually
comes
down
close
beside
it
the
two
will
then
be
together
for
awhile
but
soon
they
either
walk
or
fly
to
a
little
distance
from
one
another
after
remaining
apart
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
they
visit
again
then
again
separate
and
so
they
continue
to
act
at
longer
or
shorter
intervals
till
one
or
other
of
them
flies
off
to
sea
this
system
of
making
each
other
little
visits
and
then
going
away
and
remaining
for
some
time
apart
seems
a
feature
of
the
gull
tribe
generally
and
it
is
particularly
marked
in
the
case
of
the
great
skua
a
pair
of
these
birds
will
each
have
its
apartments
so
to
speak
and
by
turns
each
will
be
the
caller
on
or
the
receiver
of
a
call
from
the
other
either
one
will
walk
or
fly
directly
over
to
where
the
other
is
standing
or
reclining
or
it
will
make
several
circling
sweeps
before
coming
down
beside
it
or
else
for
this
is
another
fashion
each
of
them
will
set
out
to
call
on
the
other
and
meeting
in
the
centre
between
their
respective
places
have
their
gossip
there
however
the
meeting
takes
place
when
the
birds
are
together
one
of
them
will
commonly
bow
its
head
down
towards
the
ground
in
a
heavy
sort
of
manner
whilst
the
other
stands
facing
it
with
the
head
and
bill
lifted
into
the
air
all
at
once
one
of
the
birds
usually
i
think
the
caller
if
either
has
remained
at
home
turns
round
raises
its
wings
above
its
back
and
holding
them
thus
makes
a
heavy
sort
of
spring
or
running
leap
forward
along
the
ground
this
it
does
several
times
lowering
the
wings
each
time
that
it
pauses
and
raising
them
again
to
make
the
leap
from
this
it
might
be
thought
that
the
bird
flew
rather
than
leapt
but
this
when
i
saw
it
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
the
case
it
did
not
fly
but
only
jumped
with
the
wings
held
up
the
birds
are
now
apart
again
as
before
but
after
a
short
interval
the
one
that
has
behaved
in
this
odd
way
returns
and
they
again
stand
regarding
each
other
but
this
time
without
so
much
bowing
or
raising
of
the
head
then
one
of
them
and
i
think
it
is
the
same
one
turning
as
before
there
is
almost
an
exact
repetition
and
this
may
take
place
some
three
or
four
times
in
the
course
of
an
hour
the
two
will
then
often
take
wing
and
fly
for
a
while
together
sometimes
over
the
sea
but
more
often
in
a
series
of
wide
circles
round
and
about
their
home
they
are
masters
of
flight
and
after
two
or
three
flaps
will
glide
for
long
distances
without
an
effort
alternately
rising
and
sinking
varying
their
direction
by
a
turn
of
the
head
or
as
it
seems
by
presenting
the
broad
surface
of
their
wings
to
the
different
points
of
the
compass
and
sweeping
either
with
or
against
the
wind
apparently
with
equal
ease
or
with
the
wind
blowing
violently
its
normal
state
they
will
neither
advance
nor
recede
and
it
is
certainly
a
very
surprising
thing
to
see
one
of
these
great
birds
hanging
motionless
or
almost
motionless
at
but
a
foot
or
so
above
the
long
coarse
grass
which
is
being
all
the
while
bent
and
swayed
in
the
direction
towards
which
its
head
is
turned
if
it
advances
at
all
it
is
against
the
bend
of
the
grass
but
though
i
have
said
that
the
great
skua
is
a
master
of
flight
i
have
not
yet
termed
its
flight
either
graceful
or
majestic
for
a
long
time
indeed
during
which
i
had
only
seen
it
near
its
temporary
home
i
was
unable
to
do
so
not
at
least
with
a
full
conviction
for
though
i
admired
it
yet
there
seemed
always
to
be
in
it
some
want
which
i
felt
but
was
unable
to
define
it
puzzled
me
but
at
last
i
discovered
what
it
was
and
my
discovery
which
acquits
the
bird
and
is
to
the
honour
of
nature
i
will
give
as
i
wrote
it
down
directly
after
i
had
made
it
one
of
the
great
skuas
has
now
flown
right
out
to
sea
there
its
flight
which
is
peculiar
becomes
instantly
very
graceful
descending
with
a
sweep
which
though
majestic
is
yet
soft
and
gentle
it
seems
about
to
sink
upon
the
waves
when
almost
as
it
touches
them
it
glides
again
softly
upwards
to
descend
once
more
in
the
same
manner
thus
ever
rising
and
sinking
seeming
always
about
to
rest
yet
never
resting
it
glides
tireless
and
seems
to
coquet
with
the
sea
on
land
too
these
wide
circling
sweeps
had
had
a
grace
and
charm
but
it
had
not
entirely
pleased
the
eye
something
had
been
absent
but
what
that
something
was
it
had
been
beyond
me
to
say
now
i
knew
it
what
it
wanted
had
been
the
illimitable
plain
of
the
ocean
which
in
a
moment
took
away
all
heaviness
from
the
form
and
all
harshness
from
the
colouring
the
sombreness
of
the
sea
blends
now
with
its
own
and
the
waves
are
moving
with
its
own
motion
all
is
in
harmony
the
picture
has
found
its
frame
gulls
too
are
more
graceful
when
they
sweep
over
the
sea
than
the
shore
near
it
they
have
then
softness
and
expanse
as
a
background
the
latter
i
think
is
the
more
important
and
may
be
unconsciously
demanded
by
association
of
ideas
earth
had
not
been
wide
enough
for
the
great
skua
illustration
skuas
nuptial
flight
and
often
when
one
of
the
great
skuas
is
circling
round
and
the
other
standing
at
its
post
this
one
will
stretch
itself
up
and
raise
its
wings
above
the
back
every
time
its
partner
passes
this
raising
of
the
wings
enters
into
one
of
the
most
salient
of
the
many
nuptial
antics
of
this
bird
which
i
will
now
describe
in
its
completest
form
it
commences
aerially
the
two
birds
have
been
one
above
the
other
and
are
now
at
a
considerable
height
above
one
of
their
chosen
when
the
lower
one
floats
with
the
wings
extended
but
raised
very
considerably
perhaps
towards
meeting
over
the
back
an
action
which
in
their
flight
is
uncommon
as
it
does
this
it
utters
a
note
like
a
as
in
upon
which
as
at
a
signal
the
other
one
floats
in
the
same
manner
and
both
now
descend
thus
together
to
the
ground
standing
then
the
one
behind
the
other
at
about
a
yard
distance
and
faced
the
same
way
both
of
them
throw
up
their
heads
raise
their
wings
above
their
backs
pointing
them
backwards
and
stand
thus
for
some
seconds
fixed
and
motionless
looking
just
like
an
heraldic
device
at
the
same
time
they
utter
a
cry
which
sounds
like
or
the
foremost
bird
then
flies
off
and
is
instantly
followed
by
the
other
if
the
wings
were
not
extended
this
pose
would
somewhat
resemble
that
of
the
great
plovers
for
though
the
neck
is
stretched
more
forwards
it
is
curved
in
the
same
curious
way
and
the
head
though
held
high
is
bent
towards
the
ground
the
wings
however
give
it
quite
a
different
character
and
i
have
i
feel
sure
seen
some
figures
of
birds
on
a
shield
whose
attitude
bore
a
wonderful
resemblance
to
that
of
these
skuas
may
not
some
of
the
figures
of
animals
in
heraldry
have
come
right
down
from
savage
times
even
if
they
do
not
represent
totems
savages
as
we
know
catch
the
more
salient
and
strongly
characterised
attitudes
of
animals
with
wonderful
truth
and
force
the
two
birds
will
often
as
might
be
expected
assume
this
pose
without
any
previous
descent
on
upraised
wings
and
presumably
such
descent
need
not
be
followed
either
by
this
or
any
other
special
attitude
also
when
so
posing
they
do
not
always
stand
in
line
but
indifferently
sometimes
as
far
as
relative
position
is
concerned
though
at
the
same
approximate
distance
from
one
another
i
have
seen
the
descent
followed
by
the
pose
but
not
in
line
and
i
have
seen
the
pose
exactly
as
i
have
described
it
but
not
preceded
by
the
descent
obviously
or
at
least
in
all
probability
the
birds
would
be
as
likely
to
stand
in
line
when
posing
on
one
occasion
as
on
another
and
i
have
therefore
put
them
into
line
here
to
give
a
picture
of
this
nuptial
sport
when
at
its
best
and
fullest
sometimes
during
these
visits
that
the
birds
pay
to
each
other
the
two
will
bend
their
heads
down
together
and
pick
and
pull
at
the
grass
when
they
raise
them
there
may
be
a
blade
or
two
of
it
in
the
bill
of
one
which
is
allowed
to
drop
in
a
negligent
desultory
way
or
one
which
i
take
to
be
the
female
plucks
up
a
tuft
and
walks
with
it
to
the
male
as
though
to
show
him
she
lets
it
drop
and
then
both
birds
standing
front
to
front
lower
their
heads
at
the
same
time
and
utter
a
shrill
though
not
a
loud
cry
this
seems
as
though
one
bird
were
suggesting
to
the
other
the
propriety
of
building
a
nest
but
it
may
be
the
actual
manner
in
which
the
nest
is
built
there
would
of
course
be
no
doubt
as
to
this
if
the
birds
or
one
of
them
were
to
continue
thus
to
pluck
and
bring
tufts
or
blades
of
grass
but
this
was
never
the
case
when
i
saw
them
nor
did
i
ever
remark
any
action
on
their
part
that
had
more
the
appearance
of
systematic
than
this
the
nest
of
the
great
skua
is
very
slight
a
mere
litter
of
coarse
long
grass
shallow
and
having
a
pulled
tattered
look
round
the
edges
suggestive
of
the
crown
of
a
shabby
straw
hat
or
bonnet
from
which
the
remaining
portion
has
been
torn
compared
to
it
the
nest
of
a
gull
being
formed
of
quite
a
considerable
quantity
of
and
heather
and
fairly
regular
and
with
soft
cushiony
rim
all
round
it
is
almost
a
work
of
architecture
yet
neither
do
gulls
seem
to
work
regularly
or
systematically
in
the
building
of
their
nests
one
may
be
seen
piking
into
the
ground
with
its
powerful
beak
and
then
withdrawing
it
with
a
tuft
of
moss
or
a
sprig
of
heather
held
between
the
mandibles
after
making
a
few
sedate
steps
with
this
the
bird
lays
it
down
but
instead
of
fetching
some
more
now
and
continuing
the
work
it
merely
stands
there
and
appears
to
forget
all
about
it
another
will
fly
up
with
some
material
and
after
circling
a
little
above
its
partner
on
the
ground
will
alight
and
lay
it
down
as
a
contribution
beside
it
in
a
very
stolid
sort
of
way
the
other
bird
does
not
help
and
does
not
seem
particularly
interested
and
the
two
now
stand
side
by
side
for
about
when
the
one
that
has
last
arrived
flies
away
and
on
returning
again
brings
nothing
sometimes
a
gull
may
be
seen
walking
with
moss
or
heather
in
the
bill
whilst
its
consort
walks
beside
it
but
without
having
anything
when
the
heather
is
placed
by
the
one
bird
the
other
stands
by
and
seems
interested
but
does
not
assist
and
no
further
supply
is
brought
it
would
appear
therefore
that
only
one
bird
and
this
no
doubt
the
female
actually
builds
the
nest
though
the
other
the
male
may
look
on
and
take
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
intelligent
interest
in
what
she
is
doing
but
though
the
above
is
from
the
life
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
gulls
could
get
their
nests
done
at
all
if
they
worked
no
better
than
this
when
i
first
got
to
that
island
de
cuyo
nombre
no
quiero
acordarme
but
few
eggs
had
yet
been
laid
and
many
of
the
nests
were
only
half
finished
or
not
even
so
far
advanced
as
that
most
however
were
completed
or
nearly
so
and
it
is
probable
that
what
i
saw
represented
merely
the
finishing
touches
which
will
also
apply
to
the
great
skuas
what
i
saw
was
indeed
very
little
and
it
is
only
a
surmise
that
the
female
gull
builds
the
nest
without
being
aided
by
the
male
i
think
so
however
because
usually
when
both
the
male
and
female
assist
in
the
building
they
work
together
and
whilst
collecting
the
materials
keep
more
or
less
in
each
other
company
arriving
with
them
either
at
the
same
time
or
shortly
after
each
other
this
at
least
has
been
the
case
with
those
birds
which
i
have
watched
i
have
indeed
seen
two
gulls
pulling
up
the
moss
or
heather
within
a
yard
or
so
of
each
other
and
these
i
at
first
put
down
as
a
married
couple
this
however
was
not
the
case
for
they
laid
down
what
they
pulled
in
different
places
and
several
times
they
attacked
each
other
and
fought
quite
fiercely
with
other
birds
too
i
have
noticed
a
kind
of
rivalry
between
the
females
when
collecting
materials
for
the
nest
hen
chaffinches
seem
particularly
jealous
of
each
other
in
this
respect
they
pull
the
lichens
from
the
trunks
of
trees
fluttering
up
against
them
and
using
both
their
claws
and
beaks
and
when
thus
engaged
or
when
flying
off
with
what
they
have
got
two
will
often
fly
at
each
other
and
fight
furiously
in
the
air
i
do
not
think
that
the
one
tries
to
take
what
the
other
has
collected
there
ought
one
would
think
to
be
enough
for
all
but
rather
that
the
sight
of
one
when
thus
occupied
has
an
irritating
effect
on
the
other
and
so
it
seemed
to
be
with
these
two
gulls
male
gulls
fight
too
as
might
be
expected
the
motive
being
usually
if
not
always
jealousy
sometimes
a
little
drama
may
be
witnessed
as
when
a
pair
who
would
fain
be
tender
are
annoyed
and
hampered
by
a
rejected
suitor
the
villain
of
the
piece
this
odious
bird
advances
upon
them
with
a
menacing
and
it
would
almost
seem
a
scandalised
demeanour
every
time
that
he
detects
the
smallest
disposition
towards
an
impropriety
of
behaviour
and
when
the
rushes
furiously
upon
him
he
flies
just
out
of
his
danger
and
acts
in
the
same
way
on
the
next
occasion
which
is
immediately
afterwards
this
goes
on
for
some
time
the
envious
bird
becoming
more
and
more
rancorous
and
more
and
more
torn
between
rage
and
discretion
every
time
valour
assaults
him
at
last
rage
carries
it
and
strange
to
say
considering
it
as
melodrama
he
the
villain
makes
quite
a
spirited
stand
against
the
good
hero
who
by
all
the
laws
of
such
things
should
fell
him
to
the
ground
and
spurn
him
so
as
to
make
the
orthodox
situation
instead
of
this
there
is
an
equal
combat
which
ends
only
in
nothing
neither
way
except
that
as
the
bad
gull
still
goes
on
afterwards
it
is
more
in
his
favour
than
the
other
he
wins
in
fact
for
the
lovers
are
at
length
wearied
out
and
the
contemplated
impropriety
never
does
take
place
it
is
a
pity
almost
that
it
can
not
sometimes
go
like
this
in
stage
reality
to
see
the
hero
just
when
most
reeking
with
noble
utterance
put
suddenly
into
an
unshowy
position
by
the
hound
or
the
cringing
cur
would
be
a
glorious
thing
a
delightful
almost
a
gilbertian
one
could
applaud
it
to
the
very
echo
that
should
applaud
again
but
one
never
gets
the
chance
or
rather
one
would
not
if
one
tried
for
i
will
not
suppose
that
anyone
with
a
taste
for
nature
affects
the
melodrama
or
even
the
drama
nowadays
are
sometimes
very
fierce
and
determined
and
when
this
is
the
case
they
often
cause
great
excitement
among
a
number
of
others
as
on
the
human
plane
fights
between
birds
make
impressions
upon
one
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
amount
of
intensity
manifested
becoming
sometimes
quite
tragic
in
their
interest
not
only
is
this
the
case
with
oneself
but
birds
that
are
not
fighting
seem
affected
in
the
same
way
i
have
noticed
this
with
partridges
somewhat
but
more
in
the
gullery
an
ordinary
scuffle
between
two
birds
attracts
little
if
any
notice
from
the
others
but
when
it
is
sustained
and
bitter
supported
with
great
courage
on
either
side
there
may
be
quite
a
crowd
of
excited
onlookers
i
have
seen
a
very
desperate
combat
which
i
at
first
thought
was
a
general
scrimmage
it
was
not
so
however
two
alone
were
engaged
but
a
cloud
of
gulls
swept
over
and
hovered
about
them
often
hiding
them
from
view
all
were
interested
and
interested
it
seemed
to
me
against
one
of
the
two
birds
who
stood
all
the
time
on
the
defensive
beating
or
trying
to
beat
off
with
wings
and
beak
the
continual
eager
rushes
of
his
assailant
many
times
they
closed
and
went
struggling
and
flapping
over
the
ground
attended
all
the
time
by
gulls
in
the
air
and
gulls
walking
about
and
near
them
when
they
disengaged
the
same
bird
as
i
inferred
from
the
dramatic
unity
of
its
conduct
attacked
again
in
the
same
eager
way
as
though
the
greater
vivacity
of
its
feelings
or
disposition
made
it
always
more
quick
than
the
other
though
this
one
was
equally
brave
and
determined
one
might
almost
fancy
that
the
attacking
gull
had
had
some
great
wrong
done
it
by
the
one
it
attacked
this
latter
however
a
powerful
and
steady
fighter
finally
beat
off
its
assailant
who
now
took
to
the
air
sweeping
backwards
and
forwards
above
the
hated
one
it
made
each
time
that
it
passed
a
little
drop
down
upon
it
with
dangling
legs
and
delivered
or
tried
to
deliver
a
blow
with
the
feet
a
strategy
which
the
other
met
by
springing
up
and
striking
with
the
beak
such
a
conflict
as
this
makes
quite
a
commotion
in
the
gull
world
all
those
birds
that
have
been
standing
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
flying
and
circling
excitedly
about
above
the
combatants
or
settling
and
walking
up
to
them
i
did
not
see
the
so
merely
assume
it
to
have
been
jealousy
between
two
rival
males
quite
possibly
the
birds
were
females
in
none
of
these
fights
nor
in
others
that
i
have
seen
between
gulls
on
the
island
did
there
seem
to
be
any
special
set
method
either
of
attack
or
defence
as
is
so
noticeable
in
the
case
of
some
birds
it
was
a
generalised
fight
a
pankration
in
which
each
bird
did
whatever
it
could
without
art
or
plan
a
fight
between
two
that
lasted
a
long
time
was
of
another
character
they
fought
most
savagely
but
in
a
curious
manner
each
seized
the
other
by
the
beak
which
they
then
or
one
of
them
endeavoured
to
extricate
by
pulling
backwards
so
that
the
stronger
bird
or
each
alternately
dragged
the
other
over
the
ground
a
process
which
the
one
being
dragged
tried
to
resist
by
spreading
the
wings
at
right
angles
and
opposing
them
to
the
ground
to
me
it
seemed
that
one
of
the
birds
had
each
time
seized
the
other
to
advantage
and
strove
to
retain
its
hold
against
the
efforts
of
the
less
fortunate
one
to
disengage
the
length
of
time
during
which
they
remained
with
the
beaks
thus
interlocked
was
remarkable
i
was
not
able
to
time
them
but
it
was
so
long
as
to
grow
tedious
and
i
several
times
turned
the
glasses
on
to
other
objects
and
after
a
short
interval
brought
them
back
again
always
finding
them
as
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
at
the
very
least
ten
minutes
would
not
i
think
be
an
of
the
time
they
sometimes
remained
in
this
connection
the
instant
the
beaks
were
unlocked
the
birds
fiercely
seized
each
other
by
them
again
there
was
the
same
dragging
and
resistance
the
same
lengthy
duration
and
this
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
in
succession
at
length
there
was
a
very
violent
struggle
and
the
bird
that
seemed
to
have
the
advantage
in
its
hold
by
advancing
upon
the
other
while
never
relaxing
this
forced
its
head
backwards
and
at
length
right
down
upon
its
back
the
bird
so
treated
being
obviously
much
distressed
at
last
with
a
violent
effort
this
latter
got
its
bill
free
and
the
two
grappling
together
and
one
now
seizing
hold
of
the
other
wing
rolled
together
down
the
steep
face
of
the
rock
at
the
bottom
they
separated
the
bird
as
i
think
that
had
had
the
worst
of
it
all
along
flew
back
to
the
place
from
which
they
had
fallen
while
the
other
remained
seeming
somewhat
hurt
by
the
fall
some
time
later
there
was
another
conflict
between
the
same
two
gulls
which
was
similar
in
all
respects
including
the
place
at
which
it
was
fought
except
in
its
ending
this
time
there
was
no
fall
down
the
rock
but
the
one
bird
flew
off
soon
however
to
alight
again
the
other
one
pursuing
and
continuing
to
molest
it
with
savage
sweeps
from
side
to
side
no
doubt
in
a
fight
like
this
each
bird
seizes
the
other
by
the
beak
as
fearing
what
it
might
otherwise
do
with
it
as
two
men
with
knives
might
seize
hold
of
each
other
wrists
but
this
might
become
in
time
so
confirmed
a
habit
that
the
birds
when
fighting
would
have
no
idea
of
doing
anything
else
and
thus
not
attack
each
other
in
any
less
specialised
way
however
much
one
might
have
the
other
at
an
advantage
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
has
really
come
to
this
with
the
gulls
in
question
the
facts
indeed
do
not
bear
out
this
view
but
several
times
when
watching
birds
fighting
i
have
seen
as
i
believe
a
tendency
in
this
direction
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
the
process
might
be
carried
even
further
there
was
no
other
bird
very
near
to
these
two
gulls
during
all
the
long
time
that
they
fought
no
female
who
was
obviously
the
cause
of
the
affair
and
to
whom
either
of
them
went
or
showed
a
desire
to
go
either
in
the
interval
between
the
two
combats
or
at
the
end
of
it
all
yet
that
the
two
were
rival
males
seems
hardly
to
be
doubted
taking
the
season
into
consideration
this
and
the
same
observation
applies
to
the
two
wheatears
who
fought
for
hours
without
the
female
being
at
all
seems
to
show
a
power
of
retaining
a
vivid
mental
impression
of
the
loved
or
coveted
bird
in
her
absence
to
which
is
added
a
tranquil
pleasure
of
the
paired
birds
in
each
other
society
apart
from
mere
sensual
gratification
it
is
absurd
therefore
to
keep
the
word
love
to
ourselves
as
we
do
in
the
spirit
if
not
the
letter
as
in
other
things
there
is
no
line
drawn
here
in
nature
and
it
is
in
watching
animals
that
one
gets
to
know
the
real
meaning
of
all
our
high
terminology
it
is
wonderful
how
long
two
birds
who
have
chosen
each
other
will
stand
quite
motionless
close
together
as
though
they
were
a
couple
of
stones
and
then
show
by
some
mutual
or
dependent
action
that
each
is
in
the
other
mind
here
is
an
instance
a
pair
of
have
been
standing
for
a
long
time
one
just
behind
the
other
on
the
edge
of
the
grassy
slope
of
the
cliff
quite
motionless
looking
like
the
painted
wooden
birds
of
a
noah
ark
all
at
once
both
as
in
obedience
to
a
common
impulse
burst
into
wild
clamorous
cries
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
fly
out
over
the
sea
quite
soon
they
return
and
settling
again
in
precisely
the
same
spot
and
relative
position
stand
motionless
as
before
for
full
three
hours
when
one
uttering
a
little
chattering
almost
talking
note
again
launches
himself
from
the
verge
and
flies
around
for
some
three
or
four
minutes
in
the
near
neighbourhood
with
a
frequent
how
how
he
then
just
in
his
old
place
behind
the
other
talks
a
little
again
flies
off
returns
and
talks
as
before
the
other
gull
has
remained
motionless
or
almost
so
all
the
time
and
the
two
now
stand
silently
as
before
it
seems
strange
that
the
birds
should
first
act
so
mutually
and
then
so
independently
of
each
other
but
far
stranger
as
it
struck
me
was
the
absolute
instantaneousness
with
which
on
the
first
occasion
they
both
burst
out
screaming
it
is
possible
that
close
attention
to
animals
might
lead
to
evidence
pointing
in
a
new
and
unexpected
direction
but
i
will
leave
this
for
another
chapter
gulls
have
no
very
salient
or
pronounced
courting
antics
i
mean
i
have
observed
none
and
in
the
same
sense
there
is
no
special
display
of
the
plumage
by
one
sex
to
the
other
when
amorous
they
walk
about
closely
together
stopping
at
intervals
and
standing
face
to
face
then
lowering
their
heads
they
bring
their
bills
into
contact
either
just
touching
or
drawing
them
once
or
twice
across
each
other
or
else
grasping
with
and
interlocking
them
like
pigeons
raising
then
a
little
and
again
depressing
the
heads
with
them
thus
united
as
do
they
after
this
they
toss
up
their
heads
into
the
air
and
open
and
close
their
beaks
once
or
twice
in
a
manner
almost
too
soft
to
be
called
a
snap
sometimes
they
will
just
drop
their
heads
and
raise
them
again
quickly
without
making
much
action
with
the
bills
this
is
dalliance
and
between
each
little
bout
of
it
the
two
will
make
little
fidgety
steps
close
about
one
another
always
however
or
almost
always
one
of
the
birds
and
this
one
i
take
to
be
the
female
is
more
eager
has
a
more
soliciting
manner
and
look
than
the
other
it
is
she
who
as
a
rule
commences
and
draws
the
male
bird
on
she
looks
fondly
up
at
him
and
raising
her
bill
to
his
as
though
beseeching
a
kiss
just
touches
with
it
in
raising
the
feathers
of
his
throat
an
action
light
but
full
of
endearment
and
in
every
way
she
shows
herself
the
most
desirous
and
in
fact
so
worries
and
pesters
the
poor
male
gull
that
often
to
avoid
her
importunities
he
flies
away
this
may
seem
odd
to
but
i
have
seen
other
instances
of
it
no
doubt
in
actual
courting
before
the
sexes
are
paired
the
male
bird
is
usually
the
most
eager
but
after
marriage
the
female
often
becomes
the
wooer
of
this
i
have
seen
some
marked
instances
that
of
a
female
great
plover
calling
up
the
male
by
her
cries
when
pairing
took
place
between
them
i
have
already
given
and
i
have
seen
precisely
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
the
kestrel
hawk
female
rooks
too
are
often
very
importunate
with
the
males
in
the
rookery
when
building
is
going
on
it
is
always
a
great
satisfaction
when
the
male
and
female
of
a
species
differ
noticeably
in
their
plumage
as
then
one
is
never
in
uncertainty
as
to
which
of
them
it
is
that
performs
any
act
often
one
must
remain
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
this
and
often
again
one
can
only
surmise
of
course
when
one
watches
birds
for
any
time
in
the
breeding
season
one
gets
clear
ideas
as
to
which
is
the
male
and
which
the
female
but
certainty
is
better
and
certainty
at
any
moment
or
on
any
occasion
unless
there
is
some
marked
difference
between
the
sexes
one
can
not
have
in
the
case
of
gulls
however
though
the
plumage
is
alike
there
is
a
difference
in
size
sufficient
to
strike
the
eye
the
male
being
larger
in
the
great
gull
greatly
larger
than
the
female
leaving
the
palled
blandishments
of
its
spouse
the
gull
husband
cleaves
the
air
cuts
the
dark
line
of
beetling
precipice
and
seeks
the
free
haven
of
the
open
sea
where
with
other
sensible
repentant
benedicts
it
wheels
and
circles
suddenly
a
dusky
form
slender
and
though
as
large
as
a
pigeon
shoots
over
the
rounded
bastion
of
the
heather
and
sweeping
upwards
as
it
nears
the
cliffs
darts
upon
one
of
the
gulls
a
second
pirate
follows
with
wild
cries
and
long
gliding
sweeps
they
press
and
harass
the
larger
bird
who
doubling
twisting
avoiding
dodging
but
never
resisting
utters
again
and
again
a
cry
of
distress
and
complaint
its
companions
sweep
and
eddy
about
them
shooting
athwart
and
between
they
protest
they
cry
to
heaven
their
wild
voices
mingle
in
harsh
discordant
unison
with
the
of
the
waves
and
the
everlasting
notes
of
the
wind
suddenly
something
drops
from
the
oppressed
gull
there
is
a
sinking
towards
it
of
one
of
the
dark
shadows
swift
beyond
telling
but
so
soft
that
the
speed
is
not
realised
the
object
is
covered
lost
and
almost
with
a
jerk
the
eye
or
rather
the
brain
realises
that
it
has
been
caught
in
the
descent
empty
and
now
unregarded
the
robbed
bird
sweeps
on
the
pirates
sweep
back
to
the
heather
the
cloud
of
witnesses
disperse
themselves
and
as
with
us
each
day
each
hour
things
smooth
themselves
again
over
the
acts
of
successful
villainy
who
troubles
over
a
robbed
gull
what
moral
nemesis
concerns
itself
with
the
wrongs
of
some
cheated
savage
or
tribe
of
savages
over
both
there
is
some
shrieking
some
eloquence
at
the
time
but
both
are
soon
lost
in
oblivion
the
waves
close
over
the
world
jogs
on
its
way
retribution
retributive
justice
such
fine
things
may
exist
perhaps
but
if
so
it
is
for
showier
matters
had
the
skuas
robbed
an
albatross
something
perhaps
would
have
happened
their
sin
might
have
found
them
out
then
a
gull
is
like
an
armenian
or
but
there
are
so
many
thus
closes
one
of
nature
wild
dramas
the
gulls
are
circling
again
now
and
all
is
as
before
es
pfeift
der
wind
die
möven
schrein
die
wellen
die
wandern
und
schäumen
such
a
scene
as
the
above
may
often
be
witnessed
as
one
lies
on
the
heather
and
watches
but
for
one
actual
robbery
that
one
sees
there
will
be
a
dozen
or
so
unsuccessful
attempts
at
it
yet
if
one
believes
those
who
have
the
best
opportunities
of
knowing
neither
the
great
nor
the
arctic
skua
the
latter
is
the
bird
to
which
attention
has
just
been
called
ever
eat
a
fish
that
has
not
first
been
swallowed
by
a
gull
or
tern
they
say
moreover
at
least
this
assertion
is
made
in
regard
to
the
great
skua
that
if
the
booty
is
not
secured
in
but
falls
either
on
the
sea
or
land
no
further
attention
is
paid
to
it
by
the
robber
for
myself
i
believe
that
the
skuas
always
or
almost
always
feed
in
this
way
because
i
think
that
when
in
the
satisfaction
of
such
a
daily
and
almost
constant
want
as
hunger
some
curious
and
bizarre
method
had
been
adopted
it
would
tend
to
become
habitual
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
two
such
different
plans
of
obtaining
fish
as
are
respectively
swooping
upon
them
whilst
swimming
in
the
water
and
catching
them
in
the
air
upon
their
being
disgorged
by
another
bird
after
a
chase
which
is
often
long
and
arduous
could
hardly
be
carried
on
by
the
same
bird
for
it
is
probable
that
either
one
to
be
successful
would
have
to
be
habitually
employed
thus
leaving
no
room
for
the
other
moreover
the
adoption
of
such
a
peculiar
method
of
obtaining
food
at
all
implies
a
great
advantage
over
the
older
method
and
this
being
the
case
it
would
tend
entirely
to
supersede
it
but
that
the
arctic
skua
at
any
rate
thus
habitually
chases
and
robs
gulls
one
can
easily
satisfy
oneself
nor
have
i
ever
seen
either
it
or
the
great
skua
stooping
on
fish
like
terns
gulls
or
gannets
the
young
of
the
great
skua
are
fed
entirely
on
herrings
which
are
first
swallowed
by
the
parent
bird
and
then
disgorged
on
to
the
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
nest
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
myself
seen
this
done
for
it
is
impossible
to
watch
the
nesting
habits
of
a
bird
that
always
attacks
you
when
you
approach
its
nest
and
continues
to
do
so
as
long
as
you
stay
anywhere
near
it
in
these
grey
desolate
islands
there
is
no
sort
of
cover
no
tree
or
bush
with
the
branches
of
which
one
can
make
oneself
a
shelter
and
watch
unobserved
moreover
as
there
is
no
night
properly
so
speaking
only
a
portentous
lurid
murkiness
towards
midnight
which
seems
neither
to
belong
to
night
nor
day
and
in
which
as
you
can
read
small
print
the
skua
can
very
naturally
see
you
there
is
no
approaching
under
cloud
of
darkness
and
being
there
ensconced
when
morning
dawns
but
that
the
bird
disgorges
the
herrings
for
the
young
ones
after
the
manner
of
gulls
generally
and
does
not
carry
them
in
its
beak
or
claws
which
is
contrary
to
their
practice
there
can
be
no
doubt
now
as
every
one
of
these
herrings
has
as
i
believe
it
has
been
secured
in
the
manner
above
described
it
is
curious
to
reflect
that
when
finally
swallowed
by
the
young
skua
it
goes
a
progress
for
the
third
time
nor
would
it
be
easy
perhaps
to
find
another
instance
outside
this
family
of
birds
of
prey
that
has
been
twice
given
up
through
fear
once
and
then
again
through
love
the
herrings
lying
about
the
nest
and
which
have
thus
been
recently
disgorged
for
the
second
time
look
almost
as
fresh
and
clean
as
if
nothing
peculiar
had
happened
to
them
they
are
disgorged
whole
or
nearly
so
for
as
i
myself
observed
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
head
is
absent
thus
at
one
nest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
but
this
means
often
a
considerable
space
of
ground
herrings
or
their
remains
were
lying
only
ten
retained
the
head
or
any
part
of
it
at
another
where
there
were
thirteen
all
were
entirely
headless
at
another
there
were
eight
of
which
one
only
had
part
of
the
head
remaining
at
another
ten
eight
of
which
were
headless
at
another
seven
six
of
which
were
and
at
another
four
of
which
one
retained
the
entire
head
thus
out
of
herrings
only
fifteen
had
the
heads
to
them
though
the
proportion
of
the
one
to
the
other
was
different
at
different
nests
the
heads
when
thus
absent
are
entirely
so
that
is
to
say
they
are
not
to
be
found
lying
about
separately
that
the
chick
should
eat
the
head
of
the
herring
by
preference
seems
unlikely
and
particularly
when
it
is
quite
young
yet
i
have
seen
four
herrings
lying
about
a
chick
which
were
quite
fresh
and
almost
untouched
but
headless
the
question
therefore
arises
whether
the
eats
the
head
after
disgorging
the
whole
fish
or
whether
in
the
majority
of
cases
it
is
disgorged
minus
the
head
fish
are
i
believe
always
swallowed
by
birds
which
prey
upon
them
head
first
and
would
therefore
one
would
suppose
lie
in
the
gullet
in
this
direction
if
disgorged
again
tail
first
as
they
lay
the
gills
by
expanding
might
offer
such
resistance
that
the
head
would
be
in
most
cases
torn
off
if
this
be
so
then
the
skua
may
often
receive
the
fish
headless
from
the
gull
or
if
otherwise
the
head
would
be
still
more
likely
to
be
torn
off
on
a
second
disgorgement
this
however
one
would
think
must
be
a
very
disagreeable
process
for
the
bird
disgorging
and
it
would
seem
more
probable
that
the
fish
can
be
turned
or
shifted
in
the
gullet
by
some
muscular
action
on
its
part
so
as
to
be
brought
up
head
foremost
as
it
descended
but
whether
there
is
any
evidence
as
to
this
i
do
not
know
if
the
head
of
the
herring
does
not
remain
in
the
gullet
then
it
must
be
eaten
by
the
parent
skuas
after
ejection
and
it
would
seem
that
they
looked
upon
this
portion
as
their
to
which
they
were
honestly
entitled
for
they
seem
to
leave
the
rest
mostly
for
the
chicks
of
which
there
are
commonly
two
at
any
rate
a
number
of
the
herrings
will
have
only
a
small
portion
eaten
off
them
there
is
a
great
profusion
amounting
to
waste
and
there
does
not
seem
any
reason
why
the
skuas
should
vary
their
diet
during
the
breeding
season
as
they
are
asserted
to
do
since
they
have
the
sea
always
at
hand
and
the
gulls
that
are
to
them
as
their
milch
cows
breed
in
their
close
proximity
in
the
skuas
we
see
the
habit
of
obtaining
food
by
forcing
another
bird
to
disgorge
what
it
has
swallowed
perfected
and
become
permanent
so
that
the
birds
practising
it
have
risen
shall
we
say
into
rapacious
parasites
but
amongst
the
gulls
themselves
who
suffer
by
the
practice
we
may
see
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
habit
in
its
incipiency
and
may
get
a
hint
as
to
how
it
might
have
arisen
when
are
in
harbour
they
are
thronged
round
sometimes
by
hundreds
of
gulls
all
the
more
common
kinds
viz
the
lesser
and
greater
and
kittiwakes
being
mixed
and
crowded
together
when
some
offal
is
thrown
out
the
birds
that
secure
any
are
at
once
mobbed
and
often
it
is
torn
away
from
them
almost
before
they
have
swallowed
a
mouthful
to
avoid
this
they
often
rise
with
it
in
the
beak
and
get
it
down
as
fast
as
they
can
on
the
wing
dodging
and
jerking
their
head
from
side
to
side
amongst
the
pursuing
crowd
but
i
have
observed
that
the
pursuit
does
not
always
cease
after
the
morsel
has
been
swallowed
and
sometimes
whether
rarely
or
frequently
i
am
unable
to
say
the
oppressed
gull
disgorges
it
again
in
order
to
be
left
in
peace
now
amongst
a
crowd
of
birds
like
this
the
greater
number
would
be
unable
to
see
whether
the
one
they
were
pursuing
had
swallowed
his
morsel
or
not
and
would
therefore
keep
pressing
about
him
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
snatch
at
it
but
of
course
when
birds
that
were
hustled
began
to
disgorge
this
would
be
noticed
and
soon
remembered
and
they
would
then
be
hustled
so
that
they
might
do
so
in
this
or
in
some
similar
way
i
can
understand
the
habit
arising
without
any
initial
act
of
intelligence
on
the
pursuing
bird
part
perhaps
however
there
would
be
no
great
unlikelihood
in
assuming
such
an
act
of
intelligence
for
one
gull
to
conceive
the
idea
of
making
another
bring
up
what
it
had
swallowed
might
not
be
so
very
much
more
than
for
the
to
think
in
regard
to
the
osprey
with
the
fish
in
his
talons
i
make
him
drop
it
with
all
the
gull
tribe
the
bringing
up
of
the
food
again
after
swallowing
it
is
an
easy
and
habitual
action
not
only
are
the
young
fed
thus
but
i
have
some
reason
to
think
that
during
the
nuptial
season
the
presenting
in
this
manner
of
some
pretty
little
tiny
kickshaw
by
the
male
bird
to
the
female
is
looked
upon
as
a
chivalrous
and
act
perhaps
such
acts
are
reciprocal
but
i
will
give
my
two
little
instances
and
let
my
readers
draw
their
own
conclusions
the
first
is
the
case
of
a
i
was
watching
the
mother
bird
as
i
suppose
sitting
on
the
nest
over
two
young
ones
one
of
which
had
been
hatched
either
only
that
day
or
the
day
before
and
the
other
a
day
or
two
earlier
at
a
chick
moves
out
from
under
the
mother
and
leaves
the
nest
it
is
quite
active
and
has
the
general
appearance
of
a
young
chicken
being
fluffy
and
of
a
yellowish
grey
colour
speckled
with
black
at
the
second
young
one
appears
pushing
itself
out
from
under
the
mother
bird
as
she
rises
a
little
in
the
nest
at
one
the
male
gull
which
has
been
near
all
the
while
walks
slowly
and
importantly
to
the
nest
which
he
passes
and
then
turning
back
towards
it
disgorges
on
to
the
rock
a
small
fish
which
he
takes
up
in
just
the
tip
of
his
bill
and
pushes
towards
both
the
chick
on
the
rock
and
the
mother
on
the
nest
all
slowly
and
with
a
dry
sort
of
manner
as
though
the
bird
were
a
cynic
the
mother
gull
leans
forward
from
the
nest
and
takes
it
and
first
holds
it
on
the
ground
while
the
chick
outside
pecks
at
it
then
she
swallows
it
herself
the
male
now
produces
in
the
same
way
a
small
something
i
suppose
a
gobbet
of
fish
and
draws
the
chick
attention
to
it
by
touching
it
with
his
bill
and
pushing
it
a
little
towards
him
the
chick
then
swallows
it
upon
which
the
male
flies
off
and
takes
his
accustomed
stand
on
a
large
projecting
point
of
rock
close
at
hand
this
is
a
conjugal
a
domestic
picture
the
other
which
i
shall
now
give
and
in
which
the
hero
was
an
arctic
skua
was
perhaps
more
condoling
the
one
bird
stands
still
and
upright
whilst
the
other
holding
the
neck
constrainedly
down
but
with
the
head
raised
as
far
as
is
compatible
with
this
keeps
moving
round
and
round
it
after
revolving
thus
several
times
keeping
always
very
close
to
and
sometimes
actually
touching
the
standing
bird
this
one
also
stands
still
always
in
the
same
attitude
and
opens
his
beak
the
other
one
standing
as
before
now
raises
the
head
and
opens
the
beak
also
upon
which
the
satellite
bird
assuming
at
last
his
proper
height
delivers
into
it
from
his
own
something
which
he
appears
to
bring
up
and
this
as
it
seems
to
me
is
swallowed
by
the
bird
receiving
it
the
morsel
is
small
but
the
actions
of
giving
and
taking
and
afterwards
the
movements
of
the
beak
and
throat
of
the
bird
that
has
parted
with
it
are
unmistakable
this
would
appear
therefore
to
be
a
little
friendly
act
or
perhaps
an
act
of
courtship
a
between
the
male
and
female
bird
and
i
take
the
bird
who
delivers
the
morsel
and
who
is
to
be
the
male
and
the
other
who
is
uniformly
dark
the
female
skuas
as
is
well
known
attack
one
if
one
comes
at
all
near
to
their
nest
and
gulls
at
any
rate
the
two
kinds
will
sometimes
though
much
more
rarely
come
very
near
to
doing
so
too
for
instance
the
greater
gull
swoops
at
one
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
same
way
though
more
clumsily
as
do
the
skuas
except
that
he
neither
touches
you
nor
comes
so
near
every
time
he
passes
he
gives
a
loud
harsh
tuneless
cry
and
drops
down
his
legs
as
though
intending
to
strike
with
them
when
he
does
this
he
may
be
some
five
or
six
feet
above
one
head
a
little
more
perhaps
or
a
little
less
and
presents
an
odd
uncouth
appearance
the
skuas
swoop
in
silence
though
the
great
one
continually
says
ik
ik
or
words
to
that
effect
whilst
circling
between
the
swoops
on
another
occasion
two
of
the
lesser
gulls
acted
in
this
way
though
one
of
them
continued
to
do
so
for
a
much
longer
time
these
two
seemed
to
be
angry
with
each
other
making
little
motions
and
opening
their
bills
in
the
air
as
though
each
thought
it
was
the
other
fault
this
little
trait
which
would
seem
to
raise
them
nearer
humanity
i
particularly
noted
the
mode
of
attack
when
thus
aerially
delivered
is
the
same
in
all
these
birds
and
as
it
seems
to
me
curiously
ineffective
the
beak
a
powerful
weapon
is
not
employed
nor
is
a
blow
which
if
it
were
might
be
of
real
force
delivered
with
one
of
the
wings
instead
the
webbed
feet
which
would
seem
to
be
weak
in
comparison
and
have
no
talons
or
grasping
power
are
made
use
of
in
the
way
i
have
already
described
in
the
case
of
the
two
gulls
fighting
when
after
the
tussle
on
the
ground
the
one
was
swooped
at
by
the
other
the
following
account
of
the
attack
of
the
smaller
or
arctic
skua
will
apply
almost
equally
to
the
great
one
the
bird
comes
swooping
down
in
a
slanting
direction
with
great
speed
and
impetus
and
as
it
passes
over
one
head
makes
a
slight
drop
with
the
feet
hanging
down
so
that
they
administer
a
flick
just
on
the
top
of
it
as
it
shoots
by
having
made
its
demonstration
it
shoots
on
and
upwards
and
turning
in
a
wide
sweep
again
comes
rushing
down
to
repeat
it
and
so
forwards
and
backwards
for
perhaps
some
times
after
which
the
intervals
will
become
longer
the
circling
sweeps
which
fill
them
up
wider
and
more
numerous
till
the
attacks
cease
and
the
bird
flies
away
the
great
skua
however
will
attack
almost
indefinitely
the
force
of
the
downward
rush
is
in
all
cases
very
great
and
the
which
accompanies
it
quite
startling
suggesting
a
larger
bird
or
something
of
a
more
portentous
nature
altogether
in
striking
the
bird
shoots
the
feet
forward
as
they
dangle
so
that
they
hit
one
with
the
anterior
surface
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
scratch
or
grasp
with
them
the
force
that
can
be
put
into
such
a
blow
is
but
slight
and
even
in
appearance
there
is
something
trivial
and
inadequate
about
it
that
takes
away
from
the
effect
of
the
bold
sweep
which
in
the
case
of
the
great
skua
especially
strikes
the
imagination
and
is
indeed
a
fine
sight
a
terrific
blow
with
the
wing
or
a
seizing
and
tearing
with
beak
and
claw
as
with
an
eagle
would
seem
the
fitting
sequel
to
such
power
and
fierceness
this
failure
of
the
sublime
and
falling
almost
into
the
ridiculous
can
not
be
observed
when
one
is
oneself
the
object
of
attack
and
moreover
the
buffets
that
one
is
constantly
receiving
though
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
size
and
fury
of
the
birds
are
often
so
stinging
and
disagreeable
as
to
spoil
one
for
looking
at
the
matter
from
such
a
point
of
view
a
ruse
however
may
be
adopted
and
the
scales
then
fall
from
one
eyes
for
instance
i
sat
down
by
the
almost
fledged
chick
of
a
pair
of
great
skuas
and
drawing
my
plaid
over
my
head
numbered
the
attacks
of
the
parent
birds
when
i
began
to
count
it
was
and
at
they
had
made
between
them
turn
and
turn
about
swoops
at
me
of
these
were
hits
and
misses
some
of
the
hits
were
very
indeed
extremely
violent
so
that
without
the
plaid
i
could
not
have
stood
it
and
even
as
it
was
it
was
unpleasant
the
blow
is
always
delivered
with
the
feet
though
sometimes
and
pretty
often
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
portion
of
the
body
touches
one
at
the
same
time
thus
giving
more
weight
and
force
to
it
the
force
of
the
swoop
is
tremendous
and
did
the
bird
strike
one
full
with
its
whole
bulk
it
would
i
believe
knock
one
over
as
a
hare
it
is
said
has
sometimes
done
by
accident
in
leaping
over
a
hedge
after
this
heroism
i
stuck
my
umbrella
staff
or
even
stick
would
sound
better
but
it
an
umbrella
into
the
ground
arranged
my
plaid
upon
it
and
walked
to
a
little
distance
the
birds
one
after
another
swooped
at
the
plaid
but
never
hit
it
as
they
got
just
above
it
they
stretched
down
their
legs
but
at
the
last
moment
seemed
to
think
something
was
wrong
and
rose
so
as
just
to
clear
it
out
upon
this
fellowship
this
dangling
down
of
the
legs
in
which
the
speed
is
checked
and
the
grand
appearance
lost
is
quite
pitiful
why
can
not
the
birds
fell
you
with
a
blow
or
tear
you
with
the
hooked
beak
this
would
be
vein
a
tyrant
vein
but
a
flick
with
the
feet
merely
it
is
a
tame
conclusion
i
doubt
now
if
the
bird
ever
does
strike
you
with
the
body
even
lightly
it
feels
as
if
there
must
be
more
than
the
feet
at
the
time
but
probably
this
is
not
the
case
both
the
male
and
female
of
the
great
skua
defend
the
nest
and
especially
the
young
in
this
manner
but
the
swoopings
of
one
of
them
probably
of
the
female
are
generally
fiercer
than
those
of
the
other
in
my
limited
experience
this
dual
attack
was
almost
invariable
but
in
one
instance
the
nest
was
guarded
by
one
bird
alone
this
bird
as
though
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
was
even
more
than
usually
fierce
making
long
rushing
swoops
from
a
great
height
and
distance
which
would
i
believe
have
been
effective
each
time
had
i
not
bobbed
the
other
bird
circled
at
a
still
greater
height
and
never
once
joined
in
the
attack
the
height
i
may
say
from
which
the
birds
swoop
is
not
as
a
rule
very
considerable
the
above
does
not
apply
equally
to
the
arctic
skua
at
least
in
my
own
experience
for
though
often
the
two
birds
would
attack
yet
in
the
greater
number
of
cases
only
one
of
them
did
so
now
the
arctic
skua
as
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
is
one
of
those
birds
which
employs
strategy
begging
here
the
question
for
the
sake
of
brevity
as
well
as
force
to
defend
its
young
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
might
be
a
case
of
the
male
bird
most
probably
attacking
and
the
female
employing
the
ruse
i
satisfied
myself
however
that
the
same
bird
sometimes
does
both
one
and
the
other
how
often
this
is
so
and
whether
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
either
sex
to
resort
by
preference
to
one
or
the
other
method
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
out
yet
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
this
is
the
case
and
that
a
process
of
differentiation
is
in
course
of
taking
place
the
facts
are
or
appeared
to
me
to
be
these
in
the
case
of
the
great
skua
both
sexes
almost
but
not
quite
always
attack
and
there
is
no
ruse
in
that
of
the
arctic
skua
both
sexes
sometimes
attack
but
far
more
frequently
that
at
least
was
my
own
experience
one
alone
does
so
and
here
a
ruse
is
employed
in
the
former
case
we
just
see
occasionally
as
an
exception
the
raw
material
the
of
the
one
bird
that
might
conceivably
be
utilised
by
nature
for
the
elaboration
of
another
form
of
defence
in
the
latter
we
see
this
other
form
being
elaborated
questions
of
this
nature
might
be
settled
in
the
future
on
facts
observed
now
as
easily
as
a
reference
to
an
iron
ring
where
boats
were
once
moored
settles
the
question
as
to
whether
the
coast
has
risen
or
the
sea
encroached
the
coast
and
the
sea
however
remain
birds
slaughtered
by
millions
each
year
must
cease
almost
as
a
class
before
any
great
period
has
gone
by
of
what
use
then
the
ring
the
record
when
what
it
speaks
of
is
no
more
another
interesting
point
in
the
arctic
skua
which
it
shares
with
at
least
one
other
species
of
the
genus
is
its
dimorphism
or
rather
to
describe
it
more
properly
its
polymorphism
to
me
it
seems
to
offer
a
case
of
a
species
in
course
of
variation
from
one
form
into
another
in
the
two
extreme
forms
the
plumage
is
respectively
either
entirely
sombre
both
above
and
below
or
the
whole
throat
breast
and
under
surface
with
a
ring
round
the
neck
and
more
or
less
of
the
sides
of
the
head
is
of
a
fine
cream
colour
between
these
extremes
there
are
various
gradations
the
cream
being
sometimes
on
the
breast
only
whilst
the
throat
is
of
a
lighter
or
deeper
grey
more
or
less
mottled
with
the
still
darker
shade
or
the
lighter
colour
is
hardly
or
not
at
all
discernible
on
these
parts
whilst
lower
down
it
becomes
less
and
less
salient
till
it
is
merely
a
not
so
dusky
duskiness
the
birds
though
numerous
are
in
the
minority
and
both
this
and
their
being
much
handsomer
suggests
that
the
process
of
change
is
in
this
direction
whilst
the
intermediate
tintings
may
represent
the
steps
in
this
process
to
what
form
of
selection
if
to
any
are
we
to
attribute
the
change
as
the
cream
colouring
makes
the
bird
more
conspicuous
natural
selection
as
distinct
from
sexual
seems
excluded
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
the
change
of
colour
is
correlated
with
some
still
greater
advantage
and
this
is
neither
apparent
nor
likely
there
remains
sexual
selection
which
to
my
mind
is
strongly
suggested
the
modified
colouring
is
it
is
true
shared
by
the
two
sexes
but
this
is
quite
compatible
with
the
theory
which
supposes
the
tintings
of
the
male
kingfisher
and
numerous
other
brilliant
birds
to
have
been
thus
acquired
and
transmitted
in
each
stage
of
progress
to
the
female
it
would
therefore
be
interesting
though
no
doubt
difficult
to
determine
by
observation
whether
the
male
birds
were
on
an
average
more
attractive
to
the
females
than
the
other
kind
and
also
whether
the
more
handsome
form
was
increasing
in
regard
to
the
last
point
this
was
the
opinion
of
a
man
guiltless
of
theories
but
with
a
large
amount
of
experience
of
the
birds
of
these
two
species
of
skua
the
great
and
the
lesser
or
arctic
one
the
latter
appears
to
me
to
be
the
boldest
and
most
aggressive
it
will
chase
not
only
gulls
but
occasionally
the
great
skua
also
this
last
as
it
would
seem
for
sport
or
pleasure
rather
than
for
any
particular
object
in
the
same
way
they
often
chase
each
other
a
too
near
approach
to
the
nest
may
perhaps
be
the
reason
in
either
case
but
having
watched
them
attentively
i
do
not
think
that
the
pursuing
bird
is
often
under
any
real
apprehension
gulls
are
persecuted
by
them
in
the
manner
i
have
described
and
sometimes
i
think
also
in
mere
wantonness
the
larger
ones
seem
never
to
resist
but
the
kittiwake
will
sometimes
go
down
upon
the
water
turn
to
bay
and
drive
the
robber
off
gulls
seem
to
fear
the
great
skua
less
than
the
arctic
one
and
will
sometimes
mob
and
molest
it
a
single
pair
that
had
nested
on
the
outskirts
of
a
gullery
were
a
good
deal
subject
to
this
annoyance
one
and
then
another
gull
would
pursue
them
when
they
flew
near
and
sometimes
even
swoop
at
them
from
side
to
side
as
they
stood
upon
the
heather
but
i
never
saw
them
annoy
the
arctic
skuas
in
this
manner
the
latter
however
were
much
more
numerous
illustration

chapter
vi
watching
ravens
curlews
etc
a
pair
of
ravens
on
our
island
are
also
molested
by
the
gulls
and
when
either
of
them
flies
from
one
point
to
another
of
the
coast
in
their
neighbourhood
its
path
is
marked
by
a
constant
succession
of
annoying
incidents
of
this
nature
that
these
stately
birds
should
have
to
put
up
with
rudeness
from
mere
gulls
does
not
seem
right
but
so
it
is
nor
did
i
ever
see
either
of
the
two
make
any
serious
attempt
to
them
personally
i
must
say
that
i
was
at
first
so
little
impressed
by
these
ravens
that
for
a
long
time
i
did
them
the
injustice
of
looking
upon
them
as
carrion
crows
certainly
the
hoarse
bellowing
croak
which
they
uttered
as
they
flew
round
when
disturbed
by
me
impressed
me
and
made
me
wonder
but
their
size
appeared
altogether
incompatible
with
the
state
of
being
a
raven
i
suppose
the
great
frowning
precipices
over
which
they
commonly
circled
had
a
dwarfing
effect
upon
it
but
they
were
manifestly
smaller
than
any
of
the
gulls
which
molested
them
and
this
i
was
not
prepared
for
from
the
specimens
which
i
have
seen
in
museums
or
languishing
in
captivity
that
they
were
ravens
however
is
i
think
certain
from
the
very
peculiar
croaking
note
to
which
i
have
alluded
and
which
they
uttered
at
this
time
almost
constantly
when
i
came
to
the
island
these
birds
had
already
hatched
out
their
young
of
which
there
were
four
lying
in
a
loose
cradle
of
what
looked
like
sticks
but
could
not
have
been
since
these
were
nowhere
procurable
it
was
a
mass
of
something
having
the
general
appearance
of
a
battered
and
flattened
rook
nest
but
what
the
actual
materials
of
which
it
was
constructed
were
i
am
unable
to
say
the
nest
was
on
a
ledge
down
the
face
of
a
huge
precipice
forming
one
side
of
a
fissure
in
the
the
mouth
of
an
immature
fiord
dug
out
in
the
course
of
ages
by
the
slow
but
ceaseless
sapping
of
the
sea
from
the
summit
of
the
opposite
side
i
could
look
across
at
and
down
upon
it
having
an
excellent
view
the
young
birds
five
in
number
who
were
well
fledged
and
within
perhaps
a
fortnight
of
leaving
the
nest
lay
in
it
very
flatly
with
their
wings
half
spread
out
and
so
motionless
that
for
some
time
upon
first
seeing
them
i
almost
thought
they
must
be
dead
the
sudden
yet
softly
sudden
rearing
itself
up
of
one
with
an
expressive
opening
of
the
beak
expressive
of
surely
surely
it
must
be
again
now
gave
a
delightful
assurance
that
this
was
not
the
case
and
then
there
were
more
such
risings
and
expressed
convictions
at
intervals
only
however
for
it
was
wonderful
how
still
the
young
birds
would
lie
for
quite
a
long
time
and
so
closely
inwoven
within
the
cup
of
the
nest
that
it
was
only
when
they
stirred
that
five
became
a
possibility
the
ledge
being
quite
bare
and
open
the
nest
with
the
young
in
it
making
a
black
in
the
midst
of
a
great
sheet
of
white
was
conspicuously
apparent
several
times
i
saw
the
young
birds
move
themselves
backwards
to
the
inner
edge
of
the
nest
and
then
void
their
excrements
over
it
so
that
only
a
little
of
the
quite
outer
portion
was
contaminated
by
this
means
the
nest
is
kept
clean
and
dry
whilst
all
around
it
is
defiled
it
would
seem
as
though
this
power
of
ejecting
their
excrements
to
a
distance
which
various
birds
possess
was
sometimes
at
least
in
proportion
to
the
size
and
bulk
of
the
nest
which
they
construct
the
nest
of
the
shag
for
instance
and
in
a
still
greater
degree
that
of
the
common
cormorant
is
a
great
mass
of
seaweed
and
other
materials
and
the
force
with
which
the
excrement
is
shot
out
over
this
both
by
the
young
and
the
parent
birds
astonishes
one
as
does
also
its
upward
direction
i
had
always
felt
surprise
when
seeing
cormorants
and
shags
perform
this
natural
function
whilst
standing
on
the
rocks
but
it
was
not
till
i
had
watched
the
latter
birds
for
hour
after
hour
as
they
sat
on
their
nests
that
i
understood
or
thought
i
understood
the
significance
of
it
in
spite
of
the
popular
saying
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
all
young
birds
act
in
this
way
and
many
nests
are
so
constructed
that
it
would
hardly
be
possible
for
them
to
do
so
in
most
cases
everything
necessary
for
sanitation
or
convenience
could
be
effected
afterwards
by
the
parent
birds
but
this
would
not
be
the
case
with
ravens
and
cormorants
or
with
other
such
carnivorous
or
species
perhaps
therefore
the
power
which
i
speak
of
may
stand
in
joint
relation
to
the
diet
and
habits
of
the
bird
and
the
kind
of
nest
which
it
builds
i
made
many
attempts
to
witness
the
feeding
of
these
young
ravens
by
their
parents
but
owing
to
there
being
no
kind
of
cover
from
which
i
could
watch
and
no
means
of
erecting
a
proper
shelter
i
was
unable
to
do
so
i
did
what
i
could
by
means
of
pieces
of
turf
and
a
plaid
or
waterproof
stretched
over
them
but
this
was
not
sufficient
to
allay
the
suspicions
of
the
old
birds
who
had
always
seen
me
as
i
came
up
and
from
my
first
appearance
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
flew
around
croaking
and
croaking
awaiting
impatiently
the
moment
of
my
departure
it
would
have
been
difficult
not
to
sympathise
with
them
not
to
feel
like
an
intruding
vulgarian
amidst
that
lonely
wildness
for
my
part
i
never
tried
not
to
but
yielded
at
once
to
the
feeling
and
retired
each
time
with
the
humiliating
reflection
that
the
scene
would
be
the
better
without
me
yet
it
seems
strange
that
in
any
scene
of
natural
beauty
or
grandeur
the
one
figure
should
it
happen
to
be
there
that
has
the
capacity
to
feel
it
is
just
the
one
that
puts
it
out
scott
for
instance
though
he
scott
would
not
have
improved
any
highland
bit
and
shakespeare
cliff
would
hardly
have
looked
the
better
for
the
presence
even
of
shakespeare
himself
the
however
would
have
blended
artistically
but
neither
he
nor
a
kilted
shepherd
or
clansman
would
have
had
any
more
appreciative
perception
of
the
beauties
into
which
they
fitted
than
the
choughs
and
crows
themselves
the
sheep
or
the
majority
of
tourists
it
is
not
a
matter
of
clothes
alone
it
would
seem
as
though
one
must
stand
outside
of
a
thing
and
therefore
be
out
of
keeping
with
it
before
one
can
feel
and
grasp
it
though
heaven
knows
the
one
need
not
involve
the
other
scott
however
credits
the
highlanders
i
mean
the
rank
and
file
with
an
artistic
appreciation
of
the
scenery
amidst
which
they
lived
see
rob
roy
i
should
bow
to
such
an
authority
but
confess
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
but
though
i
missed
the
feeding
i
twice
saw
the
raven
mother
the
real
one
cling
on
to
the
side
of
the
nest
and
look
in
upon
her
young
ones
who
rose
and
greeted
her
hungrily
that
was
a
glorious
thing
to
see
there
was
something
in
the
bird
look
almost
indescribable
a
blending
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
cunning
criminal
knowledge
combined
with
lightheartedness
and
strong
maternal
affection
with
the
first
two
of
these
and
with
the
stately
yet
half
grotesque
action
the
bright
black
eyes
and
steely
plumage
it
never
looked
black
through
the
glasses
a
faint
flitting
idea
as
of
the
devil
was
communicated
enhancing
and
giving
piquancy
to
the
delight
she
hung
thus
for
some
moments
seeming
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
her
children
yet
all
the
while
having
her
black
cunning
eyes
half
turned
up
towards
myself
then
she
flew
away
joining
her
mate
who
had
waited
for
her
some
way
off
at
the
accustomed
place
on
the
cliffs
it
was
when
i
saw
her
like
this
and
when
the
glasses
isolated
her
from
the
general
of
rock
and
sea
that
this
raven
seemed
to
assume
her
true
size
and
dignity
and
to
become
really
a
raven
when
she
flew
it
was
different
her
sable
pinions
beating
against
the
face
of
the
precipice
added
no
effect
to
it
but
she
was
instantly
dwarfed
and
dwindled
and
became
as
nothing
a
mere
insignificant
black
speck
against
its
huge
frowning
grandeur
though
really
their
plumage
is
all
of
gleaming
purply
blues
at
a
little
distance
and
when
they
fly
ravens
look
a
dead
ugly
black
which
is
also
the
case
with
rooks
who
are
almost
equally
handsome
when
seen
closely
their
flight
is
peculiar
and
though
it
strikes
the
imagination
yet
it
can
not
be
called
at
all
grand
or
majestic
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
those
words
the
wings
which
are
broad
short
and
rounded
or
at
any
rate
present
that
appearance
to
the
eye
move
with
regular
quick
little
beats
or
when
not
flapped
are
held
out
very
straightly
and
rigidly
when
thus
extended
they
are
on
a
level
with
or
perhaps
a
little
below
the
line
of
the
back
and
from
this
in
beating
they
only
deviate
downwards
and
do
not
rise
above
it
or
very
triflingly
so
giving
them
a
very
flat
appearance
a
curious
curve
is
to
be
remarked
in
the
anterior
part
of
the
spread
wing
at
first
backwards
towards
the
tail
and
then
again
forwards
towards
the
head
all
the
primary
quills
seem
to
partake
of
this
shape
and
they
are
also
very
noticeably
disjoined
one
from
another
so
that
the
interspace
even
whilst
the
wing
is
beaten
looks
almost
as
wide
as
the
quill
by
which
i
mean
the
whole
feather
itself
i
tried
to
imagine
the
effect
of
a
number
of
these
sombre
pinions
with
the
short
eager
croak
having
something
of
a
bellowing
tone
in
it
the
croaking
raven
doth
bellow
for
revenge
over
the
carnage
of
an
ancient
battlefield
and
i
thought
i
could
do
it
pretty
well
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
in
the
present
day
of
conjuring
up
such
scenes
illustration
the
game
of
but
though
the
ordinary
flight
of
ravens
be
as
i
have
described
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
they
may
not
sometimes
soar
or
sail
for
long
distances
through
the
air
or
descend
through
it
at
great
speed
and
with
all
sorts
of
whirring
and
whizzing
evolutions
for
all
these
things
do
the
rooks
and
yet
their
ordinary
flight
is
of
a
heavy
and
plodding
character
one
very
peculiar
antic
or
trick
i
the
air
the
raven
certainly
has
whilst
flapping
steadily
along
with
regular
though
quick
beat
of
the
wings
it
closes
these
all
at
once
quite
tightly
as
though
it
were
on
the
ground
and
immediately
rolls
over
to
one
side
or
the
other
either
the
roll
is
complete
so
that
the
bird
comes
right
round
again
into
its
former
position
or
else
having
got
only
so
far
as
to
be
back
downwards
it
rolls
back
the
reverse
way
this
has
a
most
extraordinary
appearance
the
bird
is
stretched
horizontally
in
the
position
in
which
it
has
just
been
flying
and
in
rolling
over
makes
one
think
of
a
barrel
or
a
man
rolling
on
the
ground
being
in
the
air
however
it
may
by
dropping
a
little
as
it
rolls
make
less
or
possibly
no
progress
in
a
latitudinal
direction
though
whether
this
is
the
case
or
not
i
am
not
sure
to
watch
this
curious
action
through
the
glasses
is
most
interesting
each
time
there
is
a
perceptible
second
or
two
during
which
the
bird
remains
completely
reversed
back
to
earth
and
breast
to
sky
the
appearance
presented
is
equally
extraordinary
whether
it
makes
the
half
roll
and
returns
or
goes
completely
round
i
have
sometimes
seen
rooks
make
a
turn
over
in
the
air
but
this
was
more
a
disorderly
tumble
recalling
that
of
the
peewit
and
though
striking
enough
was
not
nearly
so
extraordinary
as
this
orderly
and
methodical
almost
sedate
turning
upside
down
the
feat
is
generally
performed
four
or
five
times
in
succession
at
intervals
of
some
seconds
during
which
the
steady
flight
is
continued
most
often
it
is
done
in
silence
but
sometimes
at
each
roll
over
the
raven
cries
pyar
a
penetrating
and
striking
note
sometimes
these
ravens
would
roll
in
this
manner
whilst
pursued
by
or
skirmishing
with
a
gull
and
once
i
saw
one
of
them
do
so
during
a
curious
kind
of
skirmish
or
frolic
it
was
hard
to
tell
its
exact
character
with
a
hooded
crow
whether
the
hooded
crow
turned
itself
almost
at
the
same
time
in
a
manner
somewhat
or
entirely
similar
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
it
struck
me
that
it
did
do
so
of
course
one
may
very
easily
just
miss
seeing
the
action
of
a
bird
clearly
especially
if
there
are
two
or
more
together
and
it
is
then
often
very
annoying
to
be
left
with
no
more
than
an
impression
which
may
or
may
not
be
correct
it
is
more
satisfactory
almost
to
see
nothing
than
not
to
be
sure
but
both
impression
and
doubt
should
be
stated
for
both
are
facts
and
should
not
be
suppressed
but
on
no
other
occasion
have
i
seen
a
hooded
crow
behave
in
this
way
though
i
have
watched
them
often
once
but
only
once
i
saw
one
indulging
in
an
antic
which
was
sufficiently
striking
but
of
quite
a
different
character
this
bird
would
spring
suddenly
from
the
ground
mount
up
almost
perpendicularly
to
a
moderate
height
and
then
descend
again
on
the
same
spot
or
close
to
it
making
a
sudden
lurch
and
half
tumble
in
alighting
it
did
this
some
dozen
times
but
not
always
in
so
marked
a
manner
for
sometimes
the
mount
or
tower
was
not
straight
up
from
this
spring
as
a
mountain
sheer
from
the
sea
but
arose
out
of
what
seemed
an
ordinary
flight
over
the
ground
as
it
descended
for
the
last
time
another
crow
flew
up
to
and
alighted
beside
it
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
express
an
entry
into
its
feelings
this
was
in
east
anglia
on
the
last
day
but
one
of
february
and
i
look
upon
it
as
a
premature
breaking
out
of
the
nuptial
activities
before
the
birds
had
taken
wing
to
their
more
northerly
as
to
these
aerial
antics
of
the
ravens
i
doubt
if
they
were
strictly
nuptial
on
account
of
their
performance
of
them
whilst
skirmishing
with
gulls
or
with
the
hooded
crow
these
two
ravens
were
most
devoted
guardians
of
their
young
and
they
pursued
a
plan
with
me
for
i
was
the
only
intruder
on
their
island
which
was
well
calculated
to
blind
me
with
regard
to
their
whereabouts
and
would
certainly
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
had
not
the
nest
been
so
openly
situated
and
such
a
conspicuous
object
they
took
up
their
station
daily
and
in
this
they
never
once
varied
at
a
point
on
the
cliffs
considerably
beyond
the
place
where
they
had
built
their
nest
and
which
commanded
a
wide
outlook
as
i
came
each
morning
along
the
coast
which
rose
gradually
i
became
visible
to
them
whilst
about
as
far
from
their
nest
on
the
one
side
as
they
were
on
the
other
and
the
instant
my
head
appeared
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
they
rose
together
with
the
croaking
clamour
i
have
mentioned
and
circled
about
round
their
own
promontory
this
strategy
could
hardly
have
been
improved
upon
had
it
been
carefully
thought
out
by
a
man
for
in
the
first
place
my
attention
was
at
once
directed
to
the
birds
themselves
and
then
if
the
merely
of
there
being
a
nest
had
occurred
to
me
that
part
of
the
cliffs
from
which
they
rose
and
about
which
they
wheeled
would
have
seemed
the
most
likely
place
in
which
to
search
for
it
no
doubt
had
the
nest
been
well
concealed
the
birds
would
have
done
better
not
to
have
shown
themselves
but
conspicuous
as
it
was
they
could
hardly
have
adopted
a
better
plan
of
getting
me
away
from
just
that
part
of
the
coast
where
it
was
situated
i
have
spoken
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
extreme
boldness
of
the
smaller
of
the
two
skuas
and
how
whether
in
sport
or
piracy
he
chases
birds
much
larger
than
himself
it
was
therefore
something
of
a
surprise
to
me
when
i
observed
one
morning
this
bold
buccaneer
being
himself
pursued
by
another
bird
this
was
one
of
a
pair
of
curlews
birds
that
are
as
the
spirit
of
the
sad
solitudes
in
which
they
dwell
it
is
indeed
more
as
a
part
of
the
scene
that
treeless
waste
beneath
grey
northern
skies
which
they
emphasise
and
add
expression
to
than
in
themselves
that
one
gets
to
consider
them
just
thickening
with
a
shape
the
dank
moist
atmosphere
seeming
to
have
been
strained
and
wrung
out
from
the
mist
and
rain
and
drizzle
they
are
at
most
but
a
moulded
vital
part
of
these
they
move
like
shadows
on
the
mists
when
they
cry
desolation
has
found
its
utterance
and
yet
for
all
this
their
general
appearance
with
their
long
legs
and
neck
and
immensely
long
bill
is
very
much
that
of
an
ibis
insomuch
that
seeing
them
in
this
bleak
northern
land
has
sometimes
almost
a
bizarre
effect
this
should
seem
quite
irreconcilable
with
the
other
and
yet
though
it
certainly
ought
to
be
somehow
it
is
not
so
that
at
one
and
the
same
time
this
opposite
bird
brings
a
picture
by
looking
like
an
ibis
of
egypt
and
the
south
and
is
likewise
the
very
incarnation
of
grey
skies
of
mist
and
morass
so
strangely
can
contradictions
be
reconciled
in
the
mind
or
rather
so
well
and
impartially
can
we
grasp
two
aspects
of
a
thing
when
neither
concerns
us
personally
when
they
stand
or
walk
slowly
and
sedately
these
curlews
hold
their
long
slender
necks
very
erect
and
it
is
this
with
the
beak
that
gives
them
their
character
when
they
run
they
lower
the
neck
and
the
quicker
they
go
the
lower
do
they
hold
it
in
taking
flight
they
sometimes
make
a
few
quick
running
steps
with
raised
body
as
though
launching
themselves
on
the
air
but
at
other
times
they
will
rise
from
where
they
stand
without
this
preliminary
in
flight
they
may
be
called
conspicuous
at
any
rate
by
contrast
with
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
they
disappear
simply
softly
and
silently
vanish
away
when
on
the
ground
this
is
by
reason
of
their
colouring
which
on
all
the
upper
surface
of
the
body
and
the
outside
of
the
wings
is
of
a
soft
mottled
brown
which
blends
wonderfully
with
or
rather
seems
to
become
absorbed
into
the
general
surroundings
of
moor
and
so
that
they
never
catch
the
eye
and
are
simply
gone
the
instant
this
is
taken
off
them
but
the
plumage
of
the
under
surface
of
the
body
and
of
the
inside
of
the
wings
is
much
lighter
and
this
becomes
visible
as
the
bird
rises
as
with
the
redshank
and
alternates
with
the
other
as
it
flies
around
it
is
thus
round
and
round
in
a
wide
circle
that
a
pair
of
them
will
keep
flying
when
disturbed
in
their
but
though
each
bird
is
equally
disturbed
and
anxious
and
though
their
mournful
cries
answer
each
other
like
two
sad
complaining
souls
yet
they
keep
apart
and
on
settling
do
not
run
to
each
other
from
the
drear
slope
of
a
hill
a
wail
goes
up
and
from
another
hill
or
the
cheerless
hollow
between
the
sad
sound
is
answered
or
one
will
fly
wailing
whilst
the
other
wails
and
sits
or
the
two
will
follow
each
other
along
the
ground
but
without
coming
very
near
thus
in
a
kind
of
sad
solitary
communion
they
wail
and
lament
and
so
exactly
is
each
the
counterpart
of
the
other
one
might
think
that
the
prophet
jeremiah
had
been
turned
into
a
bird
which
had
subsequently
flown
asunder
in
flight
the
wings
are
for
the
most
part
constantly
quivered
with
a
quick
and
somewhat
tremulous
motion
but
sometimes
the
bird
will
glide
with
them
outstretched
and
not
moving
just
over
the
ground
before
it
alights
or
make
a
descent
holding
them
set
in
this
manner
and
so
settle
there
is
also
a
trick
or
mannerism
of
flight
which
is
graceful
and
may
be
of
a
nuptial
character
rising
to
a
certain
height
on
quivering
wings
they
sink
down
holding
them
extended
and
motionless
after
but
a
short
descent
they
rise
again
in
the
same
quivering
way
and
so
continue
for
a
greater
or
lesser
space
of
time
the
note
which
they
utter
is
first
a
melancholy
then
a
much
louder
and
sharper
i
as
in
with
and
there
are
various
other
ones
one
of
which
if
memory
did
not
trick
me
is
just
or
very
like
a
note
which
is
but
seldom
heard
of
the
great
plover
whi
whi
whi
whi
this
bird
is
itself
a
curlew
so
that
the
resemblance
can
be
understood
its
affinities
with
the
are
unless
it
is
the
other
way
about
less
close
yet
some
part
of
the
piping
of
the
latter
bird
reminded
me
strongly
of
the
clamour
as
it
is
called
of
the
former
one
sometimes
but
more
rarely
the
mournful
of
the
curlew
is
followed
by
a
note
as
mournful
but
louder
and
more
abrupt
this
sounded
to
my
ear
something
like
but
of
course
all
such
renderings
are
arbitrary
and
more
or
less
fanciful
one
of
the
strangest
sounds
that
came
to
me
on
that
lonely
island
was
the
of
the
male
this
varies
a
good
deal
not
in
the
sound
which
is
always
the
same
but
in
the
duration
and
division
of
it
sometimes
it
is
one
soft
oh
or
oo
more
generally
perhaps
this
is
syllabled
into
or
and
often
there
is
a
much
longer
as
well
as
very
distinct
and
powerful
the
sound
seems
always
to
be
on
the
point
of
catching
yet
just
to
miss
the
human
intonation
sometimes
suggesting
a
soft
though
often
loud
mocking
laugh
at
others
a
slightly
ironical
or
surprised
ejaculation
but
this
human
element
only
just
trembles
upon
it
and
is
gone
rousing
for
a
moment
the
sense
of
man
proximity
with
its
attendant
associations
these
vanish
almost
in
the
forming
and
are
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
unutterable
loneliness
and
wildness
for
what
recalls
yet
is
far
other
enforces
the
sense
of
the
absence
of
that
which
it
recalls
yet
this
feeling
changed
too
or
rather
with
it
there
came
another
as
of
the
unseen
world
also
i
think
comprehensible
since
what
is
almost
yet
not
quite
human
must
needs
suggest
fays
elves
elementals
and
all
their
company
i
loved
the
sound
if
not
quite
music
it
was
most
softly
harmonious
and
always
from
first
to
last
brought
into
my
mind
with
strange
insistency
those
lines
in
the
sitting
on
a
bank
weeping
again
the
king
my
father
wreck
this
music
crept
by
me
upon
the
waters
allaying
both
their
fury
and
my
passion
with
its
sweet
air
then
of
course
i
was
on
prospero
island
though
heaven
knows
this
bleak
northern
one
was
little
like
it
thus
can
some
poor
bird
that
we
murder
by
an
association
merely
or
image
as
well
as
by
actual
song
dissolve
us
into
ecstasies
and
bring
all
heaven
before
our
eyes
it
was
some
little
time
before
i
could
be
quite
sure
to
what
bird
this
strange
note
belonged
it
seemed
too
poetical
for
a
duck
though
indeed
an
is
the
poetry
of
the
family
also
it
was
difficult
to
locate
seeming
to
bear
but
little
relation
to
the
place
or
distance
at
which
it
was
uttered
but
i
soon
found
that
whenever
there
were
i
heard
the
note
whereas
i
never
did
when
they
were
nowhere
about
at
last
quite
close
in
a
little
bay
as
though
they
had
come
there
to
show
me
i
tore
out
the
heart
of
their
mystery
it
was
a
lovely
sight
even
the
female
sober
brown
though
she
be
has
a
most
pleasing
appearance
but
the
male
bird
is
beauteous
indeed
in
the
pure
white
and
deep
rich
black
of
his
plumage
he
looks
at
first
as
though
clothed
all
in
velvet
and
snow
there
are
however
the
green
feathers
on
the
back
of
the
head
and
neck
which
do
not
look
like
feathers
at
all
but
rather
a
delicate
wash
of
colour
or
as
though
some
thin
glazed
material
some
green
silk
handkerchief
had
been
tied
round
his
head
with
a
view
to
health
by
the
female
members
of
his
family
and
although
at
first
with
the
exception
of
this
green
tint
all
that
is
not
the
richest
velvet
black
looks
purest
white
the
eye
through
the
glasses
growing
more
and
more
delighted
notices
soon
a
still
more
delicate
wash
of
green
about
the
upper
parts
of
the
neck
and
of
delicate
very
delicate
buff
on
the
full
rounded
breast
just
where
it
meets
the
water
these
glorified
males
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
perhaps
to
some
six
or
seven
females
swam
closely
about
the
latter
but
more
in
attendance
upon
than
as
actually
pursuing
them
for
the
females
seemed
themselves
almost
as
active
agents
in
the
sport
of
being
wooed
as
were
their
lovers
in
wooing
them
the
actions
were
as
follows
the
male
bird
first
dipped
down
his
head
till
his
beak
just
touched
the
water
then
raised
it
again
in
a
constrained
and
tense
manner
the
curious
rigid
action
so
frequent
in
the
nuptial
antics
of
birds
at
the
same
time
uttering
that
strange
haunting
note
the
air
became
filled
with
it
every
moment
one
or
other
of
the
birds
sometimes
several
together
with
upturned
bill
would
softly
laugh
or
exclaim
and
whilst
the
males
did
this
the
females
turning
excitedly
and
with
little
eager
demonstrations
from
one
to
another
of
them
kept
lowering
and
extending
forwards
the
head
and
neck
in
the
direction
of
each
in
turn
as
there
were
a
good
many
females
in
this
reunion
the
numbers
of
the
males
about
any
one
of
them
at
one
time
was
not
great
some
of
them
were
attended
by
only
one
cavalier
or
left
quite
lonely
for
a
time
but
all
kept
shifting
and
changing
the
birds
kept
always
swimming
on
and
were
now
all
together
now
scattered
over
a
considerable
surface
of
water
sometimes
two
males
would
court
one
hen
who
would
then
often
demonstrate
between
them
in
the
way
i
have
described
often
however
the
male
birds
are
in
excess
of
the
females
and
sometimes
there
will
be
only
one
female
to
a
number
of
males
who
then
press
so
closely
about
her
that
they
may
almost
be
said
to
mob
her
though
in
a
very
polite
manner
there
are
then
frequent
combats
between
the
males
one
making
every
now
and
again
a
sudden
dash
through
the
water
at
another
and
seizing
or
endeavouring
to
seize
him
by
the
head
or
scruff
of
the
neck
the
two
then
struggle
together
till
they
both
sink
or
dive
under
the
water
shortly
afterwards
they
emerge
separately
and
the
combat
is
over
for
the
time
during
if
not
as
a
part
of
these
nuptial
proceedings
the
birds
of
both
sexes
will
occasionally
rise
in
the
water
and
give
their
wings
a
brisk
flapping
they
may
also
occasionally
dive
as
a
mere
relaxation
or
to
give
vent
to
their
feelings
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
the
female
as
far
as
i
could
observe
does
not
utter
the
curious
note
but
only
a
deep
quacking
one
with
which
she
calls
to
her
the
male
birds
it
appeared
to
me
that
she
would
sometimes
show
a
preference
for
one
male
over
another
and
also
though
of
this
i
can
not
be
so
sure
a
power
of
dismissing
birds
from
her
but
if
she
really
possesses
such
a
power
she
can
not
very
well
assert
it
when
closely
pressed
upon
by
a
crowd
of
admirers
i
noticed
too
and
thought
it
curious
that
a
female
would
often
approach
a
male
bird
with
her
head
and
neck
laid
flat
along
the
water
as
though
in
a
very
disposition
and
that
the
male
bird
declined
her
advances
this
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
actions
of
the
females
when
courted
by
the
males
appears
to
me
to
raise
a
doubt
as
to
the
universal
application
of
the
law
that
throughout
nature
the
male
in
courtship
is
eager
and
the
female
coy
here
to
all
appearance
courtship
was
proceeding
and
the
birds
had
not
yet
mated
the
female
however
at
any
rate
some
of
them
appeared
to
be
anything
but
coy
as
time
went
on
and
the
birds
became
paired
this
curious
note
of
the
males
became
less
and
less
frequent
and
at
last
ceased
a
proof
i
think
that
the
note
itself
is
of
a
nuptial
character
and
also
that
the
birds
at
the
time
they
kept
uttering
it
were
seeking
their
mates
i
regret
that
i
was
not
able
to
observe
the
further
breeding
or
nesting
habits
of
these
interesting
birds
a
few
of
the
females
may
have
laid
before
i
left
the
island
but
the
greater
number
were
still
on
the
water
one
day
i
put
one
up
from
the
heather
upon
which
i
lay
down
and
waited
soon
a
pair
of
them
both
females
flew
round
me
and
alighted
together
not
far
off
both
then
lay
or
crouched
in
the
heather
at
a
few
yards
from
each
other
later
whilst
watching
from
the
coast
i
saw
two
female
eiders
walking
side
by
side
at
a
slight
distance
apart
at
intervals
they
would
pause
stand
or
sit
for
a
little
and
again
jog
on
together
these
birds
must
i
think
have
been
selecting
a
place
in
which
to
lay
their
eggs
and
if
so
it
would
seem
that
they
like
to
do
this
in
pairs
i
also
saw
a
male
sitting
for
a
considerable
time
amidst
the
heather
right
away
from
the
sea
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
mistake
the
sexes
after
the
males
have
assumed
their
adult
plumage
and
moreover
this
bird
subsequently
flew
down
into
the
little
bay
just
beneath
me
i
say
this
because
it
is
authoritatively
stated
that
the
male
never
goes
near
the
nest
it
is
probable
that
a
week
or
so
later
this
bird
could
not
have
sat
where
he
was
without
being
near
to
nest
at
any
rate
and
moreover
what
should
take
the
male
bird
from
the
sea
or
its
immediate
coast
at
all
if
it
were
not
some
impulse
appropriate
to
the
season
this
and
a
statement
made
to
me
by
a
native
in
regard
to
this
point
which
went
still
further
against
authority
makes
me
wish
that
i
had
been
able
to
see
a
little
more
as
it
is
i
have
only
a
right
to
ask
with
regard
to
this
one
male
que
diable
faire
dans
cette
galere
it
is
difficult
to
tire
of
watching
these
birds
ducks
yet
so
wonderfully
marine
the
freedom
of
the
sea
is
upon
them
far
more
than
aphrodite
they
might
have
sprung
from
its
foam
it
is
of
the
male
with
his
snowy
breast
that
one
thinks
this
one
can
not
see
them
and
think
of
a
pond
or
a
river
yet
always
they
are
so
palpably
ducks
it
is
delicious
to
see
them
heave
with
the
swell
of
the
wave
against
some
low
sloping
rock
lapping
it
like
the
water
itself
and
then
remain
upon
it
standing
or
sitting
living
jetsam
that
the
sea
has
cast
up
they
ride
like
corks
on
the
water
they
are
the
arch
of
each
wave
and
the
dimple
of
every
ripple
feed
by
diving
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
off
the
rocks
where
it
is
shallow
and
getting
there
what
is
palatable
probably
this
is
in
most
cases
eaten
under
water
but
whilst
as
a
rule
emerging
they
occasionally
bring
up
something
in
their
bill
and
dispose
of
it
floating
on
the
surface
in
one
case
this
was
i
think
a
crab
in
another
some
kind
of
their
dive
is
a
sudden
dip
down
and
in
the
act
of
it
they
open
the
wings
which
they
use
under
water
as
can
be
plainly
seen
for
a
little
way
below
the
surface
this
opening
of
the
wings
in
the
moment
of
diving
is
i
believe
a
sure
sign
that
they
are
used
as
fins
or
flippers
under
water
and
that
the
feet
play
little
or
no
part
birds
amongst
others
that
dive
in
this
way
are
to
begin
with
the
black
guillemot
looking
down
from
the
cliffs
into
the
quiet
pools
and
inlets
one
can
see
these
little
birds
the
dabchicks
of
the
ocean
swimming
under
water
and
using
their
wings
as
paddles
perfectly
well
instantly
on
diving
they
become
of
a
glaucous
green
colour
and
are
then
no
longer
like
things
of
this
world
but
fanciful
merely
suggesting
sprites
goblins
little
subaqueous
bottle
imps
for
their
shape
is
like
a
bottle
or
flat
flask
great
green
bubbles
they
look
like
and
so
too
but
larger
and
still
greener
do
the
in
their
small
size
and
rounded
shape
in
their
their
pretty
little
ways
and
actions
in
everything
almost
these
little
black
guillemots
are
the
marine
counterpart
of
the
dabchick
or
little
grebe
it
is
pretty
to
see
them
a
dozen
or
so
together
they
pursue
each
other
under
the
water
in
anger
i
think
but
it
has
the
appearance
of
sport
it
is
a
joyous
anger
they
seem
all
in
a
state
of
collective
excitement
and
out
of
this
one
will
make
a
sudden
dart
at
another
who
dives
and
the
pursuit
is
then
alternately
under
or
on
the
water
and
sometimes
just
skimming
along
it
on
the
wing
exactly
as
dabchicks
do
yet
the
black
guillemot
is
a
fair
flier
having
to
ascend
the
precipices
and
the
dabchick
too
for
the
matter
of
that
can
if
he
chooses
rise
into
the
air
and
fly
seriously
there
are
three
modes
of
delivering
the
attack
in
fighting
in
the
first
two
the
one
bird
either
just
darts
on
the
other
when
quite
near
in
which
case
there
may
be
a
slight
scuffle
before
either
or
both
disappear
or
flies
at
him
over
the
water
from
a
greater
or
lesser
distance
and
often
very
nearly
gets
hold
of
him
but
never
quite
invariably
the
other
is
down
in
time
if
it
be
only
the
justest
of
justs
the
third
plan
which
is
the
most
is
for
the
attacking
bird
to
dive
whilst
yet
some
way
off
and
coming
up
beneath
his
objective
to
spear
up
at
him
with
his
bill
and
so
nicely
does
he
judge
his
distance
that
he
always
does
come
up
exactly
where
the
swimming
bird
was
not
is
for
this
one
is
as
invariably
gone
yet
this
plan
must
sometimes
be
successful
though
i
did
not
see
a
case
in
which
it
was
at
least
i
judge
so
by
the
precipitation
with
which
the
bird
on
the
water
when
he
saw
the
other
one
dive
as
he
always
did
and
divined
his
intention
flew
up
and
off
to
some
distance
in
just
the
same
way
have
i
seen
the
great
crested
grebe
rise
up
and
fly
far
over
the
glassy
waters
of
the
lake
but
still
more
precipitately
and
indeed
in
disorder
for
rose
not
alone
from
the
surface
but
also
from
the
of
his
antagonist
whether
the
little
dabchicks
also
as
well
as
the
crested
grebes
attack
each
other
in
this
manner
i
can
not
from
observations
say
but
from
the
relationship
it
would
seem
probable
illustration
grebe
attacked
by
another
under
razorbills
also
dive
briskly
opening
the
wings
and
with
a
kick
up
as
it
were
of
the
legs
and
tail
if
one
sits
on
a
height
and
they
come
sufficiently
near
inshore
to
look
down
on
them
at
an
acute
angle
one
can
follow
their
course
under
the
water
often
for
a
considerable
time
one
remarks
then
that
the
wings
are
moved
both
together
flapped
or
beaten
so
that
the
bird
really
flies
through
the
water
in
flight
however
they
are
spread
straight
out
without
a
bend
in
them
whereas
here
they
are
all
the
while
flexed
at
the
joint
being
raised
from
and
brought
downwards
again
towards
the
sides
in
the
same
position
in
which
they
repose
against
them
when
closed
these
birds
and
no
doubt
the
other
divers
dive
not
only
to
catch
fish
but
also
for
the
sake
of
speed
i
have
seen
them
when
travelling
steadily
along
the
shore
duck
down
and
swim
or
fly
like
this
in
a
straight
line
and
but
just
below
the
surface
of
the
water
always
pursuing
the
same
direction
and
seeming
to
have
no
difficulty
in
guiding
themselves
the
speed
was
very
much
greater
than
when
they
merely
paddled
on
the
surface
thus
we
may
see
perhaps
how
such
birds
as
the
great
auk
and
the
penguins
came
to
lose
the
power
of
flight
they
could
fly
in
two
ways
either
through
the
air
or
the
water
the
first
as
long
as
they
retained
it
at
all
probably
was
much
the
quicker
but
the
other
was
quick
enough
for
their
purposes
and
the
effort
required
to
rise
from
the
water
was
thus
dispensed
with
these
razorbills
dived
in
order
to
get
more
quickly
to
some
point
for
which
they
were
making
they
might
have
got
there
still
sooner
by
flying
but
the
time
saved
was
evidently
not
worth
that
effort
to
them
but
the
power
of
flight
might
be
long
retained
by
a
bird
though
useless
to
it
in
other
respects
owing
to
its
habit
of
laying
its
eggs
on
otherwise
inaccessible
ledges
of
the
rock
when
three
or
four
razorbills
are
swimming
together
it
is
common
for
one
of
them
to
dive
first
and
for
the
rest
to
follow
in
quick
succession
sometimes
so
quick
that
the
order
in
which
they
go
down
and
the
succession
itself
can
only
just
be
followed
they
must
keep
together
under
the
water
as
well
as
above
it
since
they
will
often
emerge
so
after
some
time
and
at
a
considerable
distance
the
guillemot
dives
more
or
less
like
the
razorbill
but
i
have
not
been
successful
in
tracing
him
under
the
water
there
remains
the
puffin
i
have
been
able
to
follow
the
puffin
downwards
in
its
dive
and
at
once
noticed
that
the
legs
instead
of
being
used
were
trailed
behind
as
in
flight
so
that
the
motion
was
a
genuine
flight
through
water
unassisted
by
the
webbed
feet
with
the
razorbill
i
was
not
able
to
make
this
out
so
clearly
for
the
legs
are
black
and
the
eye
can
not
detect
them
under
the
water
as
it
can
the
bright
vermilion
ones
of
the
puffin
one
wonders
by
the
way
if
the
latter
play
any
part
under
water
such
as
the
white
tail
of
the
rabbit
is
supposed
to
do
on
land
though
i
could
see
that
just
in
diving
they
were
brought
together
and
raised
so
as
to
extend
backwards
in
the
same
way
penguins
also
trail
the
legs
like
this
in
diving
only
giving
an
occasional
paddle
with
them
whilst
the
wings
are
in
constant
motion
it
would
seem
therefore
that
those
diving
birds
which
swim
with
their
wings
under
the
water
only
use
their
feet
in
a
minor
degree
and
that
they
go
down
with
a
quick
sudden
duck
or
bob
and
in
the
act
of
opening
their
wings
on
the
other
hand
cormorants
shags
and
mergansers
birds
which
do
not
use
their
wings
in
this
way
dive
in
a
quite
different
manner
instead
of
the
sudden
little
splashy
duck
as
described
they
make
a
smooth
gliding
leap
forwards
and
upwards
rising
a
little
from
the
water
with
the
neck
stretched
out
and
wings
pressed
close
to
the
sides
to
enter
it
again
beak
foremost
like
a
curved
arrow
thus
describing
the
segment
of
a
circle
their
shape
as
they
perform
this
movement
is
that
of
a
bent
bow
and
there
is
the
same
suggestion
in
it
of
pent
strength
and
elasticity
the
shag
is
the
greatest
exponent
of
this
school
of
diving
excelling
even
the
cormorant
at
least
i
fancy
so
by
virtue
of
his
smaller
size
he
leaps
entirely
clear
of
the
water
including
even
for
a
moment
his
legs
and
feet
this
seems
really
a
surprising
feat
for
as
i
say
the
wings
are
tightly
closed
so
that
by
the
force
merely
of
the
powerful
webbed
feet
he
is
able
to
throw
himself
bodily
out
of
the
sea
it
must
be
by
a
single
stroke
i
think
for
the
motion
is
sudden
and
then
continuous
the
bird
may
of
course
have
been
in
ordinary
activity
just
previously
so
that
some
slight
degree
of
impetus
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
already
gained
but
this
is
unnecessary
and
the
leap
is
often
from
quiescence
the
merganser
dives
like
the
shag
or
cormorant
though
the
curved
leap
is
a
little
less
vigorous
and
swims
like
them
without
using
the
wings
his
food
being
fish
instead
of
getting
deeper
and
deeper
down
till
he
disappears
like
the
he
usually
swims
horizontally
sometimes
only
just
beneath
the
surface
and
as
he
comes
right
into
the
shallow
inlets
where
the
water
almost
laps
the
shore
he
can
often
be
watched
thus
gliding
in
rapid
pursuit
though
i
saw
all
his
turns
and
efforts
i
never
could
see
either
the
fish
or
the
capture
of
it
supposing
that
this
took
place
if
it
did
the
fish
must
each
time
have
been
swallowed
or
at
least
pouched
beneath
the
surface
as
the
bird
never
emerged
with
one
in
his
bill
there
are
of
course
several
different
species
of
merganser
and
goosander
i
can
not
be
quite
sure
of
the
identity
of
the
bird
which
has
given
rise
to
these
observations
i
think
it
was
the
merganser
but
no
doubt
the
ways
and
habits
of
all
the
species
are
either
identical
or
nearly
so
it
is
interesting
to
find
the
little
dabchick
of
our
ponds
and
streams
diving
sometimes
in
the
manner
of
the
shag
and
cormorant
though
of
course
tempered
with
his
own
little
soft
individuality
i
have
this
note
of
him
taken
in
the
frost
and
snow
of
a
cold
december
day
whilst
he
sported
in
his
little
creek
just
a
few
feet
in
front
of
me
he
gives
a
little
leap
up
in
the
water
making
a
graceful
curve
a
pretty
little
curl
as
he
plunges
one
sees
the
curve
of
his
back
which
is
something
as
he
down
the
action
is
that
of
the
cormorant
but
rendered
by
himself
made
dabchicky
of
course
he
is
in
the
water
all
the
time
he
does
not
shoot
right
out
of
it
there
is
far
less
power
and
energy
it
is
a
to
a
a
floss
ringlet
to
a
bended
bow
and
again
he
is
diving
now
very
prettily
with
a
graceful
little
curled
arch
in
the
air
before
going
down
i
say
that
the
dabchick
sometimes
dives
like
this
for
he
has
many
ways
of
doing
so
and
it
is
not
very
often
that
he
will
repeat
the
same
thing
twice
in
succession
sometimes
he
dips
so
smoothly
and
down
that
one
seems
hardly
to
miss
him
from
where
he
was
there
is
just
a
swirl
on
the
stream
which
seems
now
to
represent
him
and
that
all
but
silent
sound
so
cool
and
pleasant
as
of
water
sucked
down
into
water
or
swimming
smoothly
down
the
current
he
stops
suddenly
brings
the
neck
stiffly
and
straightly
forward
with
eye
fixed
intently
severely
on
the
water
piercing
down
into
it
as
though
making
a
point
and
then
down
he
goes
with
a
click
almost
a
snap
flirting
the
up
into
the
air
with
his
tiny
little
mite
of
a
tail
i
have
seen
it
stated
i
think
that
the
dabchick
has
no
tail
or
that
he
has
no
tail
to
speak
of
i
shall
speak
of
it
for
i
have
seen
it
enter
largely
into
his
deportment
when
as
i
say
he
dives
like
this
suddenly
it
may
be
flirted
up
with
such
vigour
that
mite
as
it
is
it
will
send
a
little
shower
of
sparkling
drops
to
feet
away
or
more
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
tail
as
the
whole
body
that
does
this
i
say
that
the
tail
has
its
share
and
a
good
share
too
more
perhaps
than
is
quite
fair
at
any
rate
i
have
seen
the
prettiest
little
drop
of
all
whisked
right
off
the
tip
of
it
and
the
sun
shining
more
upon
that
one
than
any
of
the
others
and
that
i
think
is
having
a
tail
to
speak
of
but
when
swimming
along
quite
quietly
the
dabchick
tail
instead
of
being
cocked
or
flirted
up
like
the
is
drawn
smoothly
down
on
the
water
so
as
not
to
project
and
thus
interfere
with
its
owner
appearance
which
is
that
of
a
little
smooth
brown
oiled
smooth
as
oil
soft
as
young
down
the
dabchick
therefore
has
a
tail
and
knows
how
to
regulate
it
between
these
two
extremes
of
the
dabchick
manner
of
diving
and
independently
of
the
little
curled
leap
cormorant
there
are
infinite
gradations
as
well
as
all
sorts
of
mannerisms
and
individualities
but
in
all
these
i
do
not
distinctly
remember
to
have
seen
him
throw
out
his
wings
in
the
act
of
going
down
i
should
be
pretty
sure
therefore
that
he
swims
only
and
does
not
fly
if
this
expression
is
permissible
under
water
if
i
did
not
seem
to
remember
having
once
seen
him
do
so
as
i
lay
with
my
head
just
over
the
river
bank
and
he
passed
underneath
me
but
it
was
years
ago
i
have
no
note
and
my
memory
may
very
likely
have
deceived
me
possibly
both
in
regard
to
this
as
well
as
the
way
in
which
he
dives
the
dabchick
may
be
in
a
transition
state
his
multifariousness
in
this
latter
respect
seems
to
render
this
likely
the
shag
if
i
mistake
not
never
dives
in
any
other
way
than
that
which
i
have
described
unless
he
is
really
alarmed
when
he
disappears
instantaneously
and
in
a
dishevelled
manner
the
also
may
follow
no
fixed
plan
in
his
diving
for
i
have
certainly
seen
him
using
his
feet
only
under
water
and
i
believe
i
have
also
seen
him
using
his
wings
though
this
too
was
many
years
ago
i
ought
not
to
be
mistaken
as
the
incident
made
such
a
deep
impression
on
me
at
the
time
i
was
standing
on
the
bank
of
a
little
creek
or
streamlet
running
out
of
a
reedy
river
the
creek
itself
however
was
clear
where
i
stood
and
all
at
once
a
strange
object
passed
right
in
front
of
me
swimming
beneath
the
surface
it
was
a
but
the
wings
used
in
the
way
i
have
been
discussing
a
thing
to
me
quite
unexpected
seemed
to
give
it
an
entirely
unbirdlike
appearance
and
surprised
me
into
thinking
for
the
moment
that
it
was
some
kind
of
turtle
the
legs
i
believe
were
also
used
alternately
in
a
kind
of
long
gliding
stride
and
may
just
have
touched
the
mud
at
the
bottom
this
however
and
i
believe
the
often
walks
in
this
way
along
the
bottom
rather
than
swims
would
seem
to
make
its
use
of
the
wings
at
the
same
time
all
the
more
unlikely
i
have
but
my
memory
which
as
evidence
after
so
many
years
is
of
little
value
in
all
such
matters
what
is
wanted
is
a
note
taken
down
at
the
time
as
to
the
actual
dive
down
of
the
whenever
i
have
seen
it
it
has
always
been
a
sudden
duck
sometimes
in
a
rather
splashy
and
disordered
manner
but
whether
the
wings
were
ever
thrown
partly
open
i
am
not
able
to
say
i
have
noted
cases
however
where
they
certainly
were
not
and
this
again
makes
it
more
likely
that
the
in
diving
does
not
use
the
wings
at
all
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
dive
unless
it
was
in
alarm
from
having
seen
me
and
with
regard
to
this
a
question
arises
which
i
think
is
of
interest
to
what
extent
namely
does
diving
enter
into
the
ordinary
habits
how
often
does
it
do
so
of
its
own
free
will
possibly
it
may
differ
as
to
this
in
different
localities
jefferies
for
instance
writes
as
though
it
were
always
diving
yet
i
have
watched
latterly
at
all
seasons
and
for
several
hours
at
a
time
without
having
once
seen
them
do
so
so
that
from
seeing
them
thus
and
without
any
suspicion
of
my
proximity
i
might
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
diving
birds
at
all
as
it
is
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
rarely
dive
except
to
avoid
danger
and
only
then
when
surprised
and
as
a
last
resource
for
instance
if
a
sees
one
from
the
smallest
distance
it
flies
to
the
nearest
belt
of
reeds
but
if
one
appears
quite
suddenly
on
the
bank
just
above
it
as
sometimes
happens
it
will
then
often
dive
even
here
however
according
to
my
own
experience
it
is
more
likely
to
trust
to
its
wings
so
that
as
it
seems
to
me
the
habit
under
any
circumstances
is
only
an
occasional
one
and
may
therefore
be
in
process
either
of
formation
or
cessation
if
we
look
at
the
foot
which
shows
no
special
adaptation
to
swimming
but
a
very
marked
one
for
walking
over
a
network
of
the
former
of
these
two
suppositions
seems
the
more
probable
the
bird
from
a
shore
and
has
become
aquatic
and
is
probably
becoming
more
so
if
the
habit
of
diving
is
only
becoming
established
it
is
possible
that
some
localities
might
be
more
conducive
to
its
quick
increase
than
others
and
it
would
be
interesting
i
think
if
observers
in
different
parts
of
the
country
would
make
and
record
observations
on
this
point
the
chariness
of
the
in
diving
is
the
more
interesting
because
the
coot
which
belongs
to
the
same
family
has
the
same
general
habits
and
has
evidently
become
aquatic
by
the
same
gradual
process
dives
frequently
and
is
accustomed
to
feed
upon
weeds
which
it
pulls
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
water
here
is
an
instance
in
which
it
will
also
be
seen
that
the
coot
manner
of
diving
is
very
much
more
formed
than
the
which
may
be
said
to
be
archaic
it
dives
down
and
reappears
shortly
with
some
dank
weediness
in
its
bill
which
it
proceeds
to
peck
about
and
swallow
on
the
surface
then
it
dives
again
comes
up
with
some
more
which
it
likewise
eats
and
does
this
several
times
in
succession
after
five
or
six
dives
it
comes
up
with
quite
a
large
quantity
with
which
it
swims
a
little
way
to
some
footing
of
flag
and
reed
and
on
this
frail
brown
raft
it
stands
whilst
picking
to
pieces
and
eating
fat
weed
which
it
has
there
deposited
having
finished
or
selected
from
it
it
swims
to
the
same
place
again
and
continues
thus
to
dive
and
feed
each
time
coming
up
with
some
weeds
in
its
beak
which
i
see
it
eat
quite
plainly
it
is
charming
to
see
this
and
also
the
way
in
which
the
bird
dives
which
is
elaborate
studied
and
yet
full
of
ease
rising
first
from
the
water
in
a
light
buoyant
manner
as
if
about
to
ascend
into
the
air
it
changes
its
mind
in
the
instant
and
plunges
beneath
the
surface
having
as
it
goes
down
a
very
globular
and
appearance
it
is
like
the
sometime
dive
of
the
dabchick
but
with
more
deportment
and
less
specific
gravity
the
dabchick
is
an
oiled
the
coot
a
balloon
the
dabchick
a
small
the
coot
an
from
this
it
would
seem
as
though
the
coot
belonged
to
the
cormorant
school
of
diving
disagreeing
in
this
with
the
to
whom
it
is
so
closely
allied
whilst
agreeing
with
the
dabchick
as
well
as
the
great
crested
grebe
and
other
birds
the
cormorant
itself
with
whom
it
has
no
close
affinities
but
this
can
not
be
said
without
considerable
qualification
for
though
the
description
i
have
given
is
from
the
life
and
seen
over
and
over
again
yet
at
other
times
the
dive
down
of
this
bird
is
so
totally
different
that
no
one
who
had
seen
only
the
one
could
think
it
capable
of
the
other
in
the
winter
coots
swim
about
in
flocks
and
then
one
may
see
first
one
little
spray
of
water
thrown
up
as
a
bird
disappears
and
then
another
that
is
all
there
is
the
spray
and
there
is
no
bird
whereas
just
before
there
was
one
indeed
i
think
it
is
a
quicker
dive
than
any
that
i
have
seen
a
make
only
equalled
perhaps
or
even
perhaps
not
quite
equalled
by
that
of
a
really
alarmed
dabchick
as
for
the
process
of
it
it
is
undiscoverable
the
eye
catches
only
the
which
is
pretty
and
always
just
the
same
but
there
is
no
disorder
no
it
is
something
which
you
ca
see
but
which
you
feel
is
the
act
of
a
master
here
again
then
the
coot
in
diving
is
quite
the
superior
the
dive
of
the
latter
bird
is
as
we
have
said
archaic
it
is
unpolished
and
greatly
wants
form
and
style
now
the
coot
is
that
is
to
say
the
skin
of
the
toes
is
extended
so
as
to
form
on
the
interspace
of
each
joint
a
thin
membrane
in
this
formation
which
likewise
distinguishes
the
grebes
we
may
perhaps
see
the
gradual
steps
by
which
the
feet
of
some
more
purely
aquatic
birds
have
become
webbed
as
the
lobes
became
larger
they
would
have
met
and
overlapped
and
from
this
to
an
actual
fusion
does
not
seem
an
impassable
gulf
this
however
is
only
a
supposition
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
web
has
been
in
most
cases
gained
by
the
extension
of
the
slight
membrane
between
the
toes
at
their
junction
with
one
another
possibly
the
lobes
on
the
toes
of
the
coot
were
gained
before
he
became
a
swimmer
and
served
the
purpose
of
supporting
him
on
mud
or
floating
vegetation
or
as
perhaps
is
more
probable
they
may
have
been
developed
in
accordance
with
the
double
requirement
at
any
rate
if
we
suppose
this
structural
modification
to
have
been
effected
after
the
bird
became
in
some
degree
truly
aquatic
then
though
this
does
not
prove
that
the
period
at
which
it
became
so
was
longer
ago
than
in
the
case
of
the
which
has
remained
structurally
unaffected
yet
it
perhaps
renders
it
likely
and
we
can
by
supposing
so
understand
why
the
one
bird
should
dive
habitually
and
the
other
only
occasionally
the
great
crested
grebe
exhibits
the
same
feature
of
variety
in
his
manner
of
diving
as
does
his
sprightly
little
relative
the
dabchick
sometimes
it
is
quite
informal
he
just
spears
the
water
before
disappearing
sinking
in
it
a
little
before
he
spears
but
at
others
there
is
the
cormorant
leap
upwards
as
well
as
forwards
before
going
down
of
course
no
more
than
with
the
dabchick
is
there
the
same
tremendous
vigour
the
wonderful
supple
virility
which
lives
in
the
leap
of
this
sea
robber
i
say
of
course
for
anyone
who
has
watched
these
birds
the
most
ornamental
perhaps
of
any
except
swans
that
swim
the
water
must
have
remarked
a
quiet
easy
one
may
almost
say
languid
grace
something
suggestive
of
high
birth
of
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
in
their
every
or
almost
every
action
masters
of
grace
indeed
they
are
and
consummate
masters
of
diving
i
do
them
wrong
descanting
upon
them
here
so
scantily
but
space
my
constant
and
persistent
enemy
will
have
it
so
i
have
not
even
sufficient
to
make
them
any
further

chapter
vii
watching
shags
and
guillemots
i
have
referred
once
or
twice
before
to
the
cormorant
including
under
this
title
the
shag
and
once
to
the
guillemot
in
this
chapter
i
shall
treat
of
both
these
birds
a
little
more
at
large
for
in
the
first
place
they
are
salient
amongst
sea
fowl
giving
a
distinctive
character
to
the
wild
places
that
they
haunt
and
secondly
i
have
watched
them
closely
and
patiently
both
are
interesting
and
the
cormorant
especially
has
a
winning
and
amiable
character
which
i
shall
the
more
enjoy
bringing
before
the
public
because
i
think
that
up
to
the
present
scant
justice
has
been
done
to
it
something
perhaps
of
the
wild
and
fierce
attaches
to
the
popular
idea
of
this
bird
due
no
doubt
both
to
its
appearance
which
has
in
it
something
dark
and
and
to
the
stern
wild
scenery
of
rock
and
sea
with
which
this
is
in
consonance
and
by
which
it
is
emphasised
perhaps
the
mere
name
even
which
has
by
no
means
a
harmless
sound
has
something
to
do
with
it
as
with
its
wings
aslant
sails
the
fierce
cormorant
seeking
some
rocky
haunt
says
longfellow
lines
which
to
me
at
least
call
up
a
graphic
picture
of
the
bird
though
i
do
not
know
that
the
first
contains
anything
which
is
specially
characteristic
of
it
and
milton
has
recorded
as
we
may
perhaps
assume
the
way
in
which
its
uncouth
shape
appealed
to
him
by
making
it
that
which
his
grand
chooses
on
one
occasion
to
assume
on
another
one
it
may
be
remembered
satan
takes
for
his
purposes
the
form
of
a
toad
and
on
each
no
doubt
the
poet
who
never
appears
to
yield
to
the
strong
temptation
as
one
would
imagine
of
loving
his
great
creation
has
intended
to
convey
a
general
idea
of
fitness
and
symbolical
similarity
as
between
the
disguised
being
and
the
disguise
taken
it
has
been
conjectured
that
the
habit
which
the
cormorant
has
of
standing
for
a
length
of
time
with
its
wings
spread
out
and
loosely
drooping
suggested
to
milton
its
appropriateness
and
certainly
there
is
an
appearance
in
this
attitude
of
the
bird
in
keeping
with
the
ideas
which
may
be
supposed
to
reign
in
satan
breast
as
he
looks
down
from
the
high
tree
of
life
upon
the
garden
of
eden
and
its
two
newly
created
inhabitants
independently
of
this
however
the
bird
as
it
stands
in
its
ordinary
posture
firmly
poised
the
body
not
quite
upright
but
inclined
somewhat
forward
with
the
curved
neck
and
strong
hooked
beak
thrown
into
bold
relief
the
dark
webbed
feet
grasping
firmly
on
the
rock
has
in
it
something
suggestive
both
of
power
and
evil
which
may
well
have
struck
milton
as
it
must
i
think
anyone
who
is
appreciative
and
either
not
an
ornithologist
or
who
if
he
is
one
will
suppress
for
the
time
being
his
special
scientific
knowledge
and
laisser
prendre
aux
as
did
the
less
falsely
critical
portion
of
moliere
audiences
for
whatever
the
cormorant
may
look
he
is
in
reality
except
from
the
fish
point
of
view
which
is
no
doubt
a
strong
one
both
a
very
innocent
and
as
i
have
said
a
very
amiable
bird
he
shines
particularly
in
scenes
of
quiet
domestic
happiness
in
the
home
circle
both
giving
and
receiving
affection
and
it
is
in
this
light
that
the
following
pictures
will
for
the
most
part
reveal
him
i
must
premise
that
they
all
refer
to
that
smaller
and
handsomer
species
of
our
two
cormorants
adorned
with
a
crest
and
whose
plumage
is
all
of
a
deep
glossy
glancing
green
called
the
shag
if
i
speak
of
him
sometimes
by
his
family
name
it
is
because
he
has
a
clear
right
to
it
and
also
because
it
has
a
more
pleasing
sound
than
the
one
which
distinguishes
him
specifically
the
habits
of
the
two
birds
are
almost
the
same
if
not
quite
identical
they
fish
together
in
the
sea
stand
together
on
the
rocks
and
in
the
earlier
stages
of
its
plumage
the
more
ornate
one
closely
resembles
the
other
in
its
permanent
dress
one
might
think
that
they
were
not
merely
the
of
a
common
and
now
extinct
ancestor
but
the
modified
form
and
its
actual
living
progenitor
but
i
am
aware
of
the
arguments
which
could
be
used
against
such
a
conclusion
i
will
now
give
my
observations
as
taken
down
at
the
time
and
should
they
be
thought
minute
to
the
point
of
tediousness
i
can
only
in
extenuation
plead
the
title
of
this
book
whilst
assuring
the
reader
that
however
it
may
lie
between
us
two
the
bird
at
any
rate
is
in
no
way
to
blame
the
way
in
which
the
male
cormorant
makes
love
to
the
female
is
as
follows
either
at
once
from
where
he
stands
or
after
first
waddling
a
step
or
two
he
makes
an
impressive
jump
or
hop
towards
her
and
stretching
his
long
neck
straight
up
or
even
a
little
backwards
he
at
the
same
time
throws
back
his
head
so
that
it
is
in
one
line
with
it
and
opens
his
beak
rather
widely
in
a
second
or
so
he
closes
it
and
then
he
opens
and
shuts
it
again
several
times
in
succession
rather
more
quickly
then
he
sinks
forward
with
his
breast
on
the
rock
so
that
he
lies
all
along
it
and
fanning
out
his
small
stiff
tail
bends
it
over
his
back
whilst
at
the
same
time
stretching
his
head
and
neck
backwards
towards
it
till
with
his
beak
he
sometimes
seizes
and
apparently
plays
with
the
feathers
in
this
attitude
he
may
remain
for
some
seconds
more
or
less
having
all
the
while
a
languishing
or
ecstatic
expression
after
which
he
brings
his
head
forward
again
and
then
repeats
the
performance
some
three
or
four
or
perhaps
times
this
would
seem
to
be
the
full
courting
display
the
complete
figure
so
to
speak
but
it
is
not
always
fully
gone
through
it
may
be
acted
part
at
a
time
the
first
part
commencing
with
the
hop
the
as
it
may
be
called
is
not
always
followed
by
the
ecstasy
in
the
recumbent
posture
and
the
last
is
still
more
often
indulged
in
without
this
preliminary
whilst
the
bird
is
sitting
thus
upon
the
rock
again
a
bird
whilst
standing
but
not
quite
erect
will
dart
his
head
forward
and
upward
and
make
with
his
bill
as
though
snapping
at
insects
in
the
air
then
after
a
second
or
two
he
will
throw
his
head
back
till
it
touches
or
almost
touches
the
centre
of
his
back
and
whilst
at
the
same
time
opening
and
shutting
the
beak
communicate
a
quick
vibratory
motion
to
the
throat
it
looks
as
though
he
were
executing
a
trill
or
doing
the
so
loved
of
italian
singers
of
which
however
there
is
no
vocal
evidence
when
the
male
bird
makes
the
great
pompous
hop
up
to
the
female
and
then
after
the
preliminaries
that
i
have
described
falls
prone
in
front
of
her
he
is
so
to
speak
at
her
feet
but
by
throwing
his
head
backwards
he
gets
practically
farther
off
nor
can
he
well
see
her
whilst
staring
up
into
the
sky
behind
him
which
is
what
he
appears
to
be
doing
thus
the
first
warmth
of
the
situation
is
a
little
chilled
and
on
the
stage
we
should
call
it
an
uncomfortable
distance
the
female
shag
seems
to
think
so
too
for
all
that
she
does
that
is
to
say
all
that
i
have
then
seen
her
do
is
to
stand
and
look
about
conduct
which
as
it
is
uninteresting
we
may
perhaps
assume
to
be
correct
but
when
the
antics
begin
as
one
may
say
from
the
second
figure
the
male
not
rising
from
his
recumbent
position
a
quite
usual
one
on
the
rock
to
make
the
first
display
the
bird
towards
whom
his
attentions
are
directed
will
often
be
standing
behind
him
and
it
then
appears
as
if
he
had
brought
back
his
head
in
order
to
gaze
up
at
her
in
this
case
she
on
her
part
will
sometimes
cosset
the
feathers
of
his
throat
or
neck
with
the
tip
of
her
hooked
bill
a
courtesy
which
you
see
him
acknowledge
by
sundry
little
pleased
movings
of
his
head
to
one
side
and
to
another
it
must
however
be
understood
that
when
i
say
it
is
the
male
bird
who
thus
pays
his
court
to
the
female
i
am
only
inferring
that
this
is
the
case
there
was
nothing
beyond
likelihood
and
analogy
to
guide
me
in
what
i
saw
and
from
some
subsequent
observations
i
have
reason
to
think
that
these
antics
are
common
to
both
sexes
as
a
rule
however
one
may
safely
assume
that
the
bird
which
in
such
matters
both
takes
the
initiative
and
does
so
in
a
very
decided
manner
is
the
male
i
will
add
that
the
waddling
step
with
which
the
male
bird
as
i
believe
approaches
the
female
may
become
quickened
and
exaggerated
into
a
sort
of
shuffling
dance
but
i
only
use
the
word
dance
because
i
can
think
of
no
slighter
yet
sufficient
one
it
is
not
i
should
imagine
intentional
but
only
the
result
of
nervous
excitement
illustration
on
a
rock
shags
during
the
breeding
these
seem
to
be
odd
antics
but
it
is
in
the
nature
of
antics
to
be
odd
and
when
such
a
bird
as
a
cormorant
indulges
in
them
one
may
expect
something
more
than
ordinarily
peculiar
the
hop
however
which
is
very
pronounced
is
not
confined
to
such
occasions
but
is
made
to
alternate
with
the
customary
waddle
when
the
bird
is
moving
about
on
the
rocks
and
especially
when
getting
up
on
to
any
low
ledge
or
projection
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
british
bird
which
adopts
this
recumbent
position
in
courtship
but
this
is
just
what
the
male
ostrich
does
as
i
have
over
and
over
again
seen
he
first
pursues
the
hen
who
flies
before
him
and
then
having
followed
her
for
a
short
distance
flings
himself
down
throws
back
his
head
upon
his
back
and
rolls
from
side
to
side
each
time
slowly
passing
the
splendid
white
feathers
of
first
one
and
then
another
wing
over
the
velvet
black
plumage
of
his
body
by
which
of
course
they
are
shown
to
the
very
best
advantage
the
hen
commonly
stops
whilst
he
is
doing
this
and
may
be
supposed
to
pay
some
attention
but
as
to
the
amount
as
i
write
from
memory
after
many
years
i
will
not
here
express
an
opinion
after
a
while
the
male
bird
rises
again
pursues
the
hen
again
flings
himself
down
and
this
is
continued
for
a
greater
or
lesser
number
of
times
till
either
he
gives
up
the
chase
or
the
two
have
come
to
a
thorough
understanding
when
thus
rolling
with
wings
spread
out
and
head
thrown
back
upon
himself
the
bird
is
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
and
it
is
easy
to
go
right
up
to
him
as
i
have
myself
done
and
seize
him
by
the
neck
before
he
becomes
aware
of
one
presence
these
antics
therefore
though
in
a
bird
so
different
as
the
ostrich
bear
a
considerable
resemblance
to
those
of
the
shag
though
the
latter
does
not
at
any
time
make
use
of
his
wings
this
again
is
interesting
for
there
is
nothing
specially
handsome
in
the
wings
of
a
cormorant
the
crest
however
is
conspicuous
as
the
head
is
flung
up
and
by
the
opening
of
the
bill
which
is
a
very
marked
feature
the
brilliant
yellow
gule
which
matches
in
colour
the
naked
outer
skin
at
the
base
of
the
mandibles
becomes
plainly
visible
this
habit
of
opening
the
bill
as
it
were
each
other
i
have
remarked
in
several
and
also
that
in
all
or
most
of
these
cases
the
interior
part
thus
disclosed
is
brightly
or
at
least
pleasingly
coloured
having
been
led
to
speak
of
the
ostrich
i
will
take
this
opportunity
of
challenging
the
statement
to
be
met
with
in
several
works
of
standing
that
the
male
bird
alone
performs
the
duties
of
incubation
i
have
lived
on
an
and
unless
i
am
dreaming
ridden
round
it
every
afternoon
in
order
to
feed
the
hens
who
had
till
then
been
sitting
on
the
eggs
and
were
often
still
to
be
seen
so
doing
but
whether
the
following
be
bathing
or
a
kind
of
aquatic
exercise
either
of
or
not
of
the
nature
of
sexual
display
i
will
leave
to
the
reader
to
decide
birds
which
live
habitually
in
the
water
do
yet
bathe
i
believe
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
the
cormorant
when
bathing
raises
himself
a
little
out
of
the
water
whilst
still
maintaining
a
horizontal
position
and
in
this
attitude
supported
as
it
would
seem
on
the
feet
he
commences
violently
to
beat
the
sea
with
his
wings
moving
also
the
tail
and
i
think
treading
down
with
the
feet
upon
the
water
the
sea
is
soon
beaten
all
into
foam
and
when
he
has
accomplished
this
desisting
he
begins
to
sport
about
in
the
whiteness
of
it
in
an
odd
excited
manner
making
little
turns
and
darts
and
often
being
just
submerged
but
no
more
he
does
this
for
a
few
minutes
stops
and
commences
again
after
a
short
interval
and
thus
continues
alternately
sporting
and
resting
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
perhaps
even
as
long
as
i
think
this
must
be
bathing
or
washing
for
other
birds
act
in
the
same
way
though
less
markedly
so
that
it
does
not
occur
to
one
to
wonder
what
they
are
about
the
little
black
guillemot
for
instance
beats
the
water
briskly
and
rapidly
with
his
wings
but
whereas
the
cormorant
beats
it
into
foam
so
that
it
looks
like
the
wake
of
a
steamer
he
raises
only
a
little
silvery
sprinkling
of
spray
for
he
but
just
flips
the
surface
of
it
with
the
tips
of
his
quill
feathers
all
the
while
his
little
upturned
fanned
tail
keeps
but
this
too
acts
more
like
a
light
shuttlecock
than
a
powerful
screw
nor
does
he
dip
so
much
or
make
such
violent
motions
as
of
a
mad
the
cormorant
performance
is
strong
an
epic
his
is
lyrical
rather
no
lofty
genius
but
a
pretty
little
minor
poet
is
the
black
guillemot
and
after
each
little
he
rises
pleasedly
and
gives
his
wings
an
applausive
little
shake
you
might
think
he
was
clapping
them
and
himself
now
i
have
found
a
nest
with
the
bird
on
it
to
see
and
watch
it
was
on
a
ledge
and
just
within
the
mouth
of
one
of
those
long
narrowing
caverns
into
and
out
of
which
the
sea
with
all
sorts
of
strange
sullen
noises
licks
like
a
tongue
the
bird
who
had
seen
me
continued
for
a
long
time
afterwards
to
crane
about
its
long
neck
from
side
to
side
or
up
and
down
over
the
nest
in
doing
which
it
had
a
very
demoniac
appearance
suggesting
some
evil
being
in
its
dark
abode
or
even
the
principle
of
evil
itself
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
watch
it
without
my
head
being
visible
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
i
was
on
i
collected
a
number
of
loose
flat
stones
that
lay
on
the
turf
above
and
at
the
cost
of
a
good
deal
of
time
and
labour
made
a
kind
of
wall
or
sconce
with
loopholes
in
it
through
which
i
could
look
yet
be
invisible
presently
the
bird
mate
came
flying
into
the
cavern
and
wheeling
up
as
it
entered
alighted
on
a
sloping
slab
of
the
rock
just
opposite
to
the
nest
for
a
little
both
birds
uttered
low
deep
croaking
notes
in
weird
unison
with
the
surroundings
and
the
sad
after
which
they
were
silent
for
a
considerable
time
the
one
standing
and
the
other
sitting
on
the
nest
to
each
other
at
length
the
former
which
i
have
no
doubt
was
the
male
hopped
across
the
slight
space
dividing
them
on
to
the
nest
which
was
a
huge
mass
of
seaweed
there
were
now
some
more
deep
sounds
and
then
bending
over
the
female
bird
the
male
caressed
her
by
passing
the
hooked
tip
of
his
bill
through
the
feathers
of
her
head
and
neck
which
she
held
low
down
the
better
to
permit
of
this
afterwards
the
two
sat
side
by
side
together
on
the
nest
the
whole
scene
was
a
striking
picture
of
affection
between
these
dark
wild
birds
in
their
lonely
home
here
was
love
unmistakable
between
so
strange
a
pair
and
in
so
wild
a
spot
but
to
them
it
was
the
sweetest
of
bowers
how
snug
how
cosy
they
were
on
that
great
wet
heap
of
brown
seaweed
just
in
the
dark
jaws
of
that
cavern
with
the
frowning
precipice
above
and
the
sea
beneath
here
in
this
gloom
this
wildness
this
stupendousness
of
sea
and
shore
beneath
grey
skies
and
in
chilling
air
here
was
peace
here
was
comfort
conjugal
love
domestic
bliss
the
same
flame
burning
in
such
strange
forms
amidst
all
the
shagginess
of
nature
the
scene
was
full
of
charm
full
of
poetry
more
so
as
it
struck
me
than
most
in
most
plays
and
novels
having
regard
of
course
to
the
majority
of
the
bad
ones
the
male
bird
now
flies
out
to
sea
again
and
after
a
time
returns
carrying
a
long
piece
of
brown
seaweed
in
his
bill
this
he
delivers
to
the
female
who
takes
it
from
him
and
deposits
it
on
the
heap
as
she
sits
meanwhile
the
male
flies
off
again
and
again
returns
with
more
seaweed
which
he
delivers
as
before
and
this
he
does
eight
times
in
the
space
of
one
hour
and
forty
minutes
diving
each
time
for
the
seaweed
with
the
true
cormorant
leap
sometimes
the
sitting
bird
when
she
takes
the
seaweed
from
her
mate
merely
lets
it
drop
on
the
heap
but
at
others
she
places
and
manipulates
it
with
some
care
all
takes
place
in
silence
for
the
most
part
but
on
some
of
the
visits
the
heads
are
thrown
up
and
there
are
sounds
hoarse
and
deeply
guttural
as
of
gratulation
between
the
two
once
the
male
bird
standing
on
the
rock
pulls
at
some
green
seaweed
growing
there
and
after
a
time
gets
it
off
was
rather
tough
work
to
pull
out
the
cork
but
he
drew
it
at
last
with
his
teeth
the
female
is
much
interested
stretches
forward
with
her
neck
over
the
nest
and
takes
the
seaweed
as
soon
as
it
is
loose
before
the
other
can
pass
it
to
her
then
she
arranges
it
on
the
nest
the
male
looking
on
the
while
as
though
she
were
the
bride
cutting
the
cake
now
he
hops
on
to
the
nest
again
and
both
together
for
i
think
the
male
joins
arrange
or
pull
the
seaweed
about
with
their
beaks
one
would
think
that
the
nest
was
still
and
that
the
eggs
were
not
yet
laid
this
last
however
is
not
the
case
several
times
whilst
waiting
alone
the
female
bird
rises
a
little
on
the
nest
and
each
time
there
is
a
gleam
like
snow
and
the
gloom
seems
deeper
against
the
cut
outline
of
a
pure
white
egg
how
full
of
poetry
and
interest
it
is
lying
there
how
unmeaning
and
one
may
almost
say
absurd
in
a
cabinet
the
nest
of
the
shag
is
continually
added
to
by
the
male
not
only
whilst
the
eggs
are
in
process
of
incubation
but
after
they
are
hatched
and
when
the
young
are
being
brought
up
in
a
sense
therefore
it
may
be
said
to
be
never
finished
though
to
all
practical
purposes
it
is
before
the
female
bird
begins
to
sit
that
up
to
this
period
the
female
as
well
as
the
male
bird
takes
part
in
the
building
of
the
nest
i
can
not
but
think
but
from
the
time
of
my
arrival
on
the
island
i
never
saw
the
two
either
diving
for
or
carrying
seaweed
together
of
course
if
all
the
hen
birds
were
sitting
this
is
accounted
for
but
from
the
courting
antics
which
i
witnessed
and
for
some
other
reasons
i
judged
that
this
was
not
the
case
once
i
saw
a
pair
of
birds
together
high
up
on
the
cliffs
where
some
tufts
of
grass
grew
in
the
niches
one
of
these
birds
only
pulled
out
some
of
the
grass
and
flew
away
with
it
accompanied
by
the
other
one
it
is
not
only
seaweed
that
is
used
by
these
birds
in
the
construction
of
the
nest
in
many
that
i
saw
grass
alone
was
visible
though
i
have
no
doubt
seaweed
was
underneath
it
and
one
in
particular
had
quite
an
ornamental
appearance
from
being
covered
all
over
with
some
having
a
number
of
small
blue
flowers
and
this
i
have
observed
in
other
nests
though
not
to
the
same
extent
a
fact
like
this
is
interesting
when
we
remember
the
and
the
way
in
which
they
ornament
their
runs
i
think
it
was
on
this
same
nest
that
i
noticed
the
picked
and
partially
bleached
skeleton
with
the
head
and
wings
still
feathered
of
a
puffin
it
had
to
be
sure
a
sorry
appearance
to
the
human
at
least
to
the
civilised
human
eye
but
if
it
had
not
been
brought
there
for
the
sake
of
ornament
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason
and
brought
there
or
at
least
placed
upon
the
nest
by
the
bird
it
must
almost
certainly
have
been
the
brilliant
beak
and
saliently
marked
head
of
the
puffin
must
be
here
remembered
again
pieces
of
wood
or
spar
cast
up
by
the
sea
and
whitened
by
it
are
often
to
be
seen
stuck
amongst
the
seaweed
and
on
one
occasion
i
saw
a
bird
fly
with
one
of
these
to
its
nest
and
place
it
upon
it
in
all
this
as
it
seems
to
me
the
beginnings
of
a
tendency
to
ornament
the
nest
are
clearly
exhibited
it
would
be
interesting
to
observe
if
the
common
cormorant
exhibits
the
same
tendency
or
to
the
same
degree
the
shag
being
a
handsome
and
adorned
bird
we
might
on
darwinian
principles
expect
to
find
the
æsthetic
sense
more
developed
in
it
than
in
its
plainer
and
unadorned
relative
both
the
sexes
share
in
the
duty
and
pleasure
of
incubation
and
as
in
some
other
species
to
see
them
relieve
each
other
on
the
nest
is
to
see
one
of
the
prettiest
things
in
bird
life
the
bird
that
you
have
been
watching
has
sat
patiently
the
whole
morning
and
once
or
twice
as
it
rose
in
the
nest
and
shifted
itself
round
into
another
position
on
the
eggs
you
have
seen
the
gleam
of
them
as
they
lay
there
as
white
as
ocean
foam
in
the
moon
at
last
when
it
is
well
on
in
the
afternoon
the
partner
bird
flies
up
and
stands
for
some
minutes
preening
itself
whilst
the
one
on
the
nest
who
is
turned
away
throws
back
the
head
towards
it
and
opens
and
shuts
the
bill
somewhat
widely
as
in
greeting
several
times
the
newcomer
then
jumps
and
waddles
to
the
further
side
of
the
nest
so
as
to
front
the
sitting
bird
and
sinking
down
against
it
with
a
manner
and
action
full
both
of
affection
and
a
sense
of
duty
this
one
is
half
pushed
half
persuaded
to
leave
finally
doing
so
with
the
accustomed
grotesque
hop
as
it
comes
down
on
the
rock
it
turns
towards
the
other
who
is
now
settling
on
to
the
eggs
and
throwing
up
its
head
into
the
air
opens
the
bill
so
as
to
show
or
at
any
rate
showing
the
brightly
coloured
space
within
all
this
it
does
with
the
greatest
what
shall
we
say
not
exactly
but
character
it
is
a
character
part
there
is
an
indescribable
expression
in
the
bird
all
over
it
as
of
something
vastly
important
having
been
accomplished
of
relief
of
satisfaction
of
and
also
of
a
certain
grotesque
and
archness
but
as
though
all
these
were
only
felt
she
then
for
i
think
it
is
the
female
before
flying
away
picks
up
a
white
feather
from
the
ledge
and
passes
it
to
the
male
now
established
on
the
nest
who
receives
and
places
it
it
has
all
been
nearly
in
silence
only
a
few
low
guttural
notes
having
passed
between
the
birds
whilst
they
were
close
together
just
in
the
same
way
the
birds
relieve
each
other
after
the
eggs
have
been
hatched
and
when
the
young
are
being
fed
and
attended
to
a
shag
i
think
the
female
bird
is
sitting
on
her
nest
with
the
young
ones
whilst
the
male
stands
on
a
higher
ledge
of
the
rock
a
yard
or
so
away
he
now
jumps
down
and
stands
for
a
moment
with
head
somewhat
erected
and
beak
slightly
open
then
he
makes
the
great
pompous
hop
which
i
have
described
before
coming
down
right
in
front
of
the
female
who
raises
her
head
towards
him
and
opens
and
closes
the
mandibles
several
times
in
the
approved
manner
the
two
birds
then
nibble
as
it
were
the
feathers
of
each
other
necks
with
the
ends
of
their
bills
and
the
male
takes
up
a
little
of
the
grass
of
the
nest
seeming
to
toy
with
it
he
then
very
softly
and
persuadingly
pushes
himself
against
the
sitting
bird
seeming
to
say
my
turn
now
and
thus
gets
her
to
rise
when
both
stand
together
on
the
nest
over
the
young
ones
the
male
then
again
takes
up
a
little
of
the
grass
of
the
nest
which
he
passes
towards
the
female
who
also
takes
it
and
they
toy
with
it
a
little
together
before
allowing
it
to
drop
the
insinuating
process
now
continues
the
male
in
the
softest
and
gentlest
manner
pushing
the
female
away
and
then
sinking
down
into
her
place
where
he
now
sits
whilst
she
stands
beside
him
on
the
ledge
as
soon
as
the
relieving
bird
has
settled
itself
amidst
the
young
and
whilst
the
other
one
is
still
there
not
yet
having
flown
off
to
sea
it
begins
to
feed
them
their
heads
very
small
and
with
beaks
not
seeming
to
be
much
longer
in
proportion
to
their
size
than
those
of
young
ducks
are
seen
moving
feebly
about
pointing
upwards
but
with
very
little
precision
very
gently
and
seeming
to
seize
the
right
opportunity
the
parent
bird
takes
first
one
head
and
then
another
in
the
basal
part
or
gape
of
his
mandibles
turning
his
own
head
on
one
side
in
order
to
do
so
so
that
the
rest
of
the
long
bill
projects
sideways
beyond
the
chick
head
without
touching
it
in
this
connection
and
whilst
the
chick
head
is
quite
visible
little
if
any
more
than
the
beak
being
within
the
gape
of
the
parent
bird
the
latter
bends
the
head
down
and
makes
that
particular
action
as
of
straining
so
as
to
bring
something
up
which
one
is
familiar
with
in
pigeons
this
process
is
gone
through
several
times
before
the
bird
standing
on
the
ledge
flies
away
to
return
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
a
piece
of
seaweed
which
is
laid
on
the
nest
here
again
as
throughout
the
sexes
of
the
birds
can
only
be
inferred
or
merely
guessed
at
both
share
in
incubation
both
feed
the
young
both
i
think
bring
seaweed
to
the
nest
and
both
are
exactly
alike
as
the
chicks
become
older
they
thrust
the
head
and
bill
farther
and
farther
down
the
throat
of
the
parent
bird
and
at
last
to
an
astonishing
extent
always
however
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
parent
bird
brought
up
the
food
into
the
chick
bills
in
some
state
of
preparation
and
was
not
a
mere
passive
bag
from
which
the
latter
pulled
out
fish
in
a
whole
state
there
were
several
nests
all
in
unobstructed
view
and
so
excellent
were
my
glasses
that
practically
i
saw
the
whole
process
as
though
it
had
been
taking
place
on
a
table
in
front
of
me
the
chicks
on
withdrawing
their
heads
from
the
parental
throat
would
often
slightly
open
and
close
the
mandibles
as
though
still
tasting
something
in
a
manner
which
one
may
describe
as
smacking
the
bill
but
on
no
occasion
did
i
observe
anything
projecting
from
the
bill
when
this
was
withdrawn
as
one
would
expect
sometimes
to
be
the
case
if
unmodified
fish
were
pulled
up
but
not
if
these
were
in
a
soft
porridgey
condition
always
too
the
actions
of
the
parent
bird
suggested
that
particular
process
which
is
known
as
regurgitation
and
which
may
be
observed
with
pigeons
and
also
as
i
have
seen
and
recorded
with
the
nightjar
cormorants
as
they
sit
on
the
nest
have
a
curious
habit
of
twitching
or
quivering
the
muscles
of
the
throat
so
that
the
feathers
dance
about
in
a
very
noticeable
manner
especially
if
that
rare
phenomenon
a
glint
of
sunshine
should
happen
to
fall
upon
them
whilst
doing
so
they
usually
sit
quite
still
sometimes
with
the
bill
closed
but
more
frequently
perhaps
with
the
mandibles
separated
by
a
breadth
or
so
i
have
watched
this
curious
kind
of
st
vitus
dance
going
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
and
it
seems
as
though
it
might
continue
indefinitely
for
any
length
of
time
all
at
once
it
will
cease
for
a
while
and
then
as
suddenly
break
out
again
it
is
not
only
the
old
birds
that
twitch
the
throat
in
this
manner
the
chicks
do
so
too
in
just
as
marked
a
degree
and
on
account
of
the
skin
of
their
necks
being
naked
it
is
perhaps
more
noticeable
in
their
case
than
with
the
parent
birds
i
have
observed
exactly
the
same
thing
though
it
was
not
quite
so
conspicuous
in
the
nightjar
so
that
i
can
not
help
asking
myself
the
question
whether
it
stands
in
any
kind
of
connection
with
the
habit
of
bringing
up
food
for
the
young
from
the
crop
or
stomach
the
regurgitatory
process
i
will
not
be
sure
but
i
think
that
the
same
curious
of
the
throatal
feathers
may
be
observed
in
pigeons
as
they
sit
on
the
nest
it
is
that
portion
of
the
throat
which
lies
just
below
the
bird
gape
i
am
here
speaking
of
the
shag
including
both
the
feathered
and
the
naked
skin
between
the
cleft
of
the
lower
mandible
and
extending
to
the
sides
of
the
neck
which
is
principally
twitched
or
quivered
the
above
perhaps
is
a
trivial
observation
but
no
one
can
watch
these
birds
very
closely
without
being
struck
by
the
habit
young
shags
are
at
first
naked
and
black
also
blind
as
i
was
able
to
detect
through
the
glasses
afterwards
the
body
becomes
covered
with
a
dusky
grey
down
and
then
every
day
they
struggle
more
and
more
into
the
likeness
of
their
parents
they
soon
begin
to
imitate
the
postures
and
it
is
a
pretty
thing
to
see
mother
and
young
one
sitting
together
with
both
their
heads
held
stately
upright
or
the
little
woolly
chick
standing
up
in
the
nest
and
hanging
out
its
thin
little
featherless
wings
just
as
mother
is
doing
or
just
as
it
has
seen
her
do
at
other
times
they
lie
sprawling
together
either
flat
or
on
their
sides
they
are
and
playful
seize
playfully
hold
of
each
other
bills
and
will
often
bite
and
play
with
the
feathers
of
their
parent
tail
in
fact
they
are
a
good
deal
like
puppies
and
the
heart
goes
out
both
to
them
and
to
their
loving
careful
assiduous
mother
and
father
as
pretty
domestic
scenes
are
enacted
daily
and
hourly
on
this
stern
old
rock
within
the
very
heave
and
dash
of
the
waves
as
ever
in
arcadia
or
in
any
neat
little
elegant
bower
where
the
goddess
of
such
things
presides
or
does
not
the
sullen
sea
itself
might
smile
to
watch
its
pretty
children
thus
at
play
and
to
me
it
seemed
that
it
did
the
nest
and
affairs
of
when
both
birds
are
at
home
the
one
that
stands
on
the
rock
by
or
near
the
nest
is
ready
to
guard
it
from
all
intrusion
should
another
bird
fly
on
to
the
rock
and
alight
in
his
opinion
too
near
it
he
immediately
advances
towards
him
shaking
his
wings
and
uttering
a
low
grunting
note
which
is
full
of
intention
finding
itself
in
a
false
position
the
intruding
bird
flies
off
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
when
two
nests
are
not
far
apart
the
sentinels
belonging
to
each
are
in
too
close
a
proximity
and
begin
to
cast
jealous
glances
upon
one
another
in
such
a
case
neither
bird
can
retreat
without
some
loss
of
dignity
and
as
a
result
there
is
a
fight
i
have
witnessed
a
drama
of
this
nature
as
in
the
case
of
the
the
two
locked
their
beaks
together
and
the
one
which
seemed
to
be
the
stronger
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
pull
the
other
towards
him
which
the
weaker
bird
on
his
part
resisted
as
desperately
using
his
wings
both
as
opposing
props
and
also
to
push
back
with
this
lasted
for
some
while
but
the
pulling
bird
was
unable
to
drag
the
other
up
the
rock
and
finally
lost
his
hold
instead
of
trying
to
regain
it
he
turned
and
shuffled
excitedly
to
the
nest
and
when
he
reached
it
the
bird
sitting
there
stretched
out
her
neck
towards
him
and
opened
and
shut
her
beak
several
times
in
quick
succession
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
to
her
i
hope
you
observed
my
prowess
was
it
well
done
and
she
had
replied
i
should
think
i
observe
it
it
was
well
done
on
the
worsted
bird
ascending
the
rock
to
get
to
nest
the
victorious
one
ran
or
rather
waddled
at
him
putting
him
to
a
short
flight
up
to
it
but
though
defeated
this
bird
was
cordially
received
by
his
own
partner
who
threw
up
her
head
and
opened
her
bill
at
him
in
the
same
way
as
though
sympathising
and
saying
do
mind
him
rude
in
such
affairs
either
bird
is
safe
as
soon
as
he
gets
within
close
distance
of
his
own
nest
for
it
would
be
against
all
precedent
and
something
monstrous
that
he
should
be
followed
beyond
a
certain
charmed
line
drawn
around
it
nothing
is
more
interesting
than
to
look
down
from
the
summit
of
some
precipice
on
to
a
ledge
at
no
great
distance
below
which
is
quite
crowded
with
guillemots
roughly
speaking
the
birds
form
two
long
rows
but
these
rows
are
very
irregular
in
depth
and
formation
and
swell
here
and
there
into
little
knots
and
clusters
besides
often
merging
into
or
becoming
mixed
with
each
other
so
that
the
idea
of
symmetry
conveyed
is
of
a
very
modified
kind
and
may
be
sometimes
broken
down
altogether
in
the
first
row
a
certain
number
of
the
birds
sit
close
against
and
directly
fronting
the
wall
of
the
precipice
into
the
angle
of
which
with
the
ledge
they
often
squeeze
themselves
several
will
be
closely
pressed
together
so
that
the
head
of
one
is
often
resting
against
the
neck
or
shoulder
of
another
which
other
will
also
be
making
a
pillow
of
a
third
and
so
on
others
stand
here
and
there
behind
the
seated
ones
each
being
as
a
rule
close
to
his
or
her
partner
there
is
another
irregular
row
about
the
centre
of
the
ledge
and
equally
here
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
sitting
birds
have
their
beaks
pointed
towards
the
cliff
whilst
the
standing
ones
are
turned
indifferently
there
are
generally
several
birds
on
the
edge
of
the
parapet
and
at
intervals
one
will
come
pressing
to
it
through
the
crowd
in
order
to
fly
down
to
the
sea
whilst
from
time
to
time
also
others
fly
up
and
alight
upon
it
often
with
in
their
beaks
on
a
ledge
of
perhaps
some
dozen
or
so
paces
in
length
there
may
be
from
sixty
to
eighty
guillemots
and
as
often
as
they
are
counted
the
number
will
be
found
to
be
approximately
the
same
most
of
the
sitting
birds
are
either
incubating
or
have
young
ones
under
them
which
as
long
as
they
are
little
they
seem
to
treat
very
much
as
though
they
were
eggs
others
however
when
they
stand
up
are
seen
to
have
nothing
underneath
them
for
as
with
other
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
there
seems
to
be
a
great
disparity
in
the
time
at
which
different
individuals
begin
to
lay
in
the
case
of
the
puffin
for
instance
some
birds
may
be
seen
collecting
grass
and
taking
it
to
their
burrows
whilst
others
are
bringing
in
a
regular
supply
of
fish
to
their
young
much
affection
is
shown
between
the
paired
birds
one
that
is
sitting
either
on
her
egg
or
young
one
for
no
difference
in
the
attitude
can
be
discovered
will
often
be
very
much
cosseted
by
the
partner
who
stands
close
behind
or
beside
her
with
the
tip
of
his
long
pointed
beak
he
as
it
were
nibbles
the
feathers
or
perhaps
rather
scratches
and
tickles
the
skin
between
them
of
her
head
neck
and
throat
whilst
she
with
her
eyes
half
closed
and
an
expression
as
of
submitting
to
an
enjoyment
a
well
i
suppose
i
must
look
bends
her
head
backwards
or
screws
it
round
sideways
towards
him
occasionally
nibbling
with
her
bill
also
amidst
the
feathers
of
his
throat
or
the
thick
white
plumage
of
his
breast
presently
she
stands
up
revealing
the
small
chick
whose
head
has
from
time
to
time
been
visible
just
peeping
out
from
under
its
mother
wing
upon
this
the
other
bird
bends
its
head
down
and
cossets
in
the
same
way
but
very
gently
and
with
the
extreme
tip
of
the
bill
the
little
tender
young
one
the
mother
does
so
too
and
then
both
birds
standing
together
side
by
side
over
the
chick
pay
it
divided
attentions
seeming
as
though
they
could
not
make
enough
either
of
their
child
or
each
other
it
is
a
pretty
picture
and
here
is
another
one
a
bird
we
will
think
her
the
female
as
she
performs
the
most
part
has
just
flown
in
with
a
fish
a
in
her
bill
she
makes
her
way
with
it
to
the
partner
who
rises
and
shifts
the
chick
that
he
has
been
brooding
over
from
himself
to
her
this
is
done
quite
invisibly
as
far
as
the
chick
is
concerned
but
you
can
see
that
it
is
being
done
the
bird
with
the
fish
to
whom
the
chick
has
been
shifted
now
takes
it
in
hand
stooping
forward
her
body
and
drooping
down
her
wings
so
as
to
make
a
kind
of
little
tent
or
awning
of
them
she
sinks
her
bill
with
the
fish
in
it
towards
the
rock
then
raises
it
again
and
does
this
several
times
before
either
letting
the
fish
drop
or
placing
it
in
the
chick
bill
for
which
it
is
i
can
not
quite
see
it
is
only
now
that
the
chick
becomes
visible
its
back
turned
to
the
bird
standing
over
it
and
its
bill
and
throat
moving
as
though
swallowing
something
down
then
the
bird
that
has
fed
it
shifts
it
again
to
the
other
who
receives
it
with
equal
care
and
bending
down
over
it
appears
for
it
is
now
again
invisible
to
help
or
assist
it
in
some
way
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
the
chick
had
wanted
assistance
for
the
fish
was
a
very
big
one
for
so
small
a
thing
and
it
would
seem
as
if
he
swallowed
it
bodily
after
this
the
chick
is
again
treated
as
an
egg
by
the
bird
that
has
before
had
charge
of
him
that
is
to
say
he
is
sat
upon
apparently
just
as
though
he
were
to
be
incubated
or
suppressed
like
the
in
in
wonderland
on
account
of
the
closeness
with
which
the
chick
is
guarded
by
the
parent
birds
and
the
way
in
which
they
both
stand
over
it
it
is
difficult
to
make
out
exactly
how
it
is
fed
but
i
think
the
fish
is
either
dropped
at
once
on
the
rock
or
dangled
a
little
for
it
to
seize
hold
of
it
is
in
the
bringing
up
and
looking
after
of
the
chick
that
one
begins
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
sitting
guillemots
being
always
turned
towards
the
cliff
for
from
the
moment
that
the
egg
is
hatched
one
or
other
of
the
parent
birds
interposes
between
the
chick
and
the
edge
of
the
parapet
of
course
i
can
not
say
that
the
rule
is
universal
but
i
never
saw
a
guillemot
incubating
with
its
face
turned
towards
the
sea
nor
did
i
ever
see
a
chick
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
parent
bird
who
was
with
it
it
seems
probable
that
the
relative
positions
of
the
sitting
bird
and
the
egg
would
be
continued
from
use
after
the
latter
had
become
the
young
one
and
if
we
suppose
that
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
where
these
positions
were
reversed
the
chick
perished
from
running
suddenly
out
from
under
the
parent
and
falling
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
we
can
understand
natural
selection
having
gradually
eliminated
the
source
of
this
danger
but
natural
selection
may
have
acted
in
another
direction
which
would
have
been
still
more
conducive
to
the
safety
of
the
chick
i
observed
that
the
latter
even
when
as
i
judged
by
its
tininess
it
had
only
been
quite
recently
hatched
was
as
alert
and
as
well
able
to
move
about
as
a
young
chicken
or
partridge
but
whilst
possessing
all
the
power
it
appeared
to
have
little
will
to
do
so
its
lethargy
as
shown
by
the
way
in
which
even
when
a
good
deal
older
it
would
sit
for
hours
without
moving
from
under
the
mother
struck
me
as
excessive
and
it
would
certainly
seem
that
on
a
bare
narrow
ledge
to
fall
from
which
would
be
certain
death
chicks
of
a
lethargic
disposition
would
have
an
advantage
over
others
who
were
fonder
of
running
about
if
we
suppose
that
a
certain
number
of
chicks
perished
even
amongst
those
whose
parents
always
stood
between
them
and
the
sheer
edge
we
can
understand
both
the
one
and
the
other
step
towards
security
having
been
brought
about
either
successively
or
side
by
side
with
each
other
from
the
foregoing
it
would
appear
that
the
young
guillemot
is
fed
with
fish
which
are
brought
straight
from
the
sea
in
the
parent
bill
and
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
gulls
disgorged
for
them
after
having
been
first
swallowed
it
is
however
a
curious
fact
that
the
fish
when
thus
brought
in
is
sometimes
at
any
rate
headless
the
reason
of
this
i
do
not
know
but
with
the
aid
of
the
glasses
i
have
made
quite
certain
of
it
and
each
time
it
appeared
as
though
the
head
had
been
cleanly
cut
off
moreover
on
alighting
on
the
ledge
the
bird
always
has
the
fish
a
whenever
i
saw
it
held
lengthways
in
the
beak
with
the
tail
drooping
out
to
one
side
of
it
and
the
head
part
more
or
less
within
the
throat
a
position
which
seems
to
suggest
that
it
may
have
been
swallowed
or
partially
swallowed
whereas
puffins
and
razorbills
carry
the
fish
they
catch
crosswise
with
head
and
tail
depending
on
either
side
i
have
also
once
or
twice
thought
that
i
saw
a
bird
which
just
before
had
had
no
fish
in
its
bill
all
at
once
carrying
one
but
i
may
well
have
been
mistaken
and
it
does
not
seem
at
all
likely
that
the
birds
should
usually
carry
their
fish
and
thus
as
will
appear
shortly
subject
themselves
to
persecution
if
they
could
disgorge
it
without
inconvenience
with
regard
to
the
occasional
absence
of
the
head
perhaps
this
is
sometimes
cut
off
in
catching
the
fish
or
before
it
is
swallowed
which
may
also
have
been
the
case
with
the
herrings
brought
by
the
great
skuas
to
their
young
however
i
can
but
give
the
facts
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
observe
them
married
birds
sometimes
behave
in
a
pretty
manner
with
the
fish
that
they
bring
to
each
other
and
if
coquetry
be
not
the
right
word
to
apply
to
it
i
know
of
none
better
the
following
is
my
note
made
at
the
time
a
bird
flies
in
with
a
fine
in
his
bill
and
having
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
whole
ledge
with
it
at
last
succeeds
in
bringing
it
to
his
partner
for
a
long
time
now
these
two
coquet
together
with
the
fish
the
one
that
has
brought
it
keeps
biting
and
nibbling
at
it
moving
his
head
about
with
it
from
side
to
side
bringing
it
down
upon
the
ledge
between
his
feet
then
raising
it
again
seeming
to
rejoice
in
the
having
it
the
other
one
seems
all
the
while
to
admire
it
too
and
often
makes
as
though
to
take
it
from
him
prettily
and
softly
but
he
refuses
it
to
her
something
as
a
dog
prettily
refuses
to
give
up
a
stick
to
his
master
at
last
however
he
lets
her
take
it
which
it
is
apparent
he
has
meant
to
do
all
the
time
and
when
she
has
it
she
behaves
in
much
the
same
manner
with
it
whilst
he
would
seem
to
beg
it
back
of
her
and
thus
they
go
on
together
for
such
a
time
that
at
last
i
weary
of
watching
them
there
is
a
wonderful
making
much
of
the
fish
between
the
two
birds
yet
it
is
not
eaten
by
either
of
them
and
there
is
no
chick
here
in
the
case
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
fish
is
only
something
for
coquetry
and
affection
to
gather
about
it
is
a
focus
a
a
peg
to
hang
love
upon
yet
the
birds
and
this
is
what
i
constantly
notice
seem
only
to
have
a
kind
of
half
consciousness
of
what
they
mean
this
particular
fish
i
may
say
was
minus
the
head
which
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
neatly
and
cleanly
cut
off
yet
there
are
harsher
notes
amidst
all
this
tenderness
and
the
state
of
a
bird
appetite
will
sometimes
make
a
vast
difference
in
its
conduct
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstances
a
bird
for
instance
that
has
just
come
with
a
fish
in
its
bill
for
the
young
one
is
violently
attacked
and
this
several
times
in
succession
by
the
other
parent
who
is
in
actual
charge
of
the
chick
this
one
we
will
suppose
it
to
be
the
father
though
i
half
think
unjustly
makes
the
greediest
dart
at
the
fish
trying
to
seize
it
out
of
his
bill
and
also
pecks
her
very
violently
once
he
seizes
her
by
the
neck
and
holds
her
thus
for
some
seconds
yet
all
the
while
in
the
couched
attitude
and
with
the
chick
underneath
him
the
poor
mother
yields
each
time
to
the
storm
scuttles
out
of
the
way
seems
perplexed
and
startled
but
keeps
firm
hold
of
the
fish
driven
away
over
and
over
again
she
always
comes
back
and
at
length
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
right
feeling
weathers
the
storm
insinuates
herself
into
the
place
of
the
greedy
bird
and
begins
to
feed
the
chick
a
new
chord
of
feeling
is
now
struck
and
the
bird
that
has
been
so
greedy
and
in
the
most
tender
and
interested
manner
with
the
wife
whom
he
has
outraged
the
of
a
moment
ago
is
forgotten
and
there
is
now
a
widely
different
and
more
accustomed
one
of
family
concord
tenderness
and
peace
i
can
not
think
that
such
conduct
as
the
above
is
common
and
even
on
this
one
occasion
when
i
saw
it
it
is
possible
though
it
does
not
seem
very
likely
that
the
bird
did
not
try
to
get
the
fish
for
its
own
sake
but
only
to
feed
the
chick
with
but
however
this
may
have
been
fish
are
the
constant
cause
of
disturbance
amongst
the
birds
generally
and
the
guillemot
that
flies
in
with
one
has
to
avoid
the
snaps
made
at
it
by
all
those
near
to
where
he
alights
and
must
sometimes
run
the
gauntlet
of
most
of
the
birds
on
the
ledge
before
he
can
get
with
it
to
his
own
domicile
sometimes
he
loses
the
fish
which
is
then
often
lost
again
by
the
successful
bird
and
so
passed
from
one
to
another
or
it
may
be
tugged
at
for
a
long
time
by
two
birds
that
have
a
firm
hold
of
the
head
and
tail
part
respectively
and
pull
it
backwards
and
forwards
not
infrequently
across
the
neck
of
a
third
bird
standing
between
them
birds
incubating
or
brooding
over
their
young
ones
are
equally
ready
with
those
standing
to
try
and
snatch
away
a
fish
from
another
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
bird
who
has
flown
in
with
his
booty
and
has
a
very
firm
hold
of
it
gets
it
safely
through
the
crowd
such
episodes
as
these
are
rather
of
the
nature
of
assault
and
robbery
than
regular
fighting
for
the
bird
attacked
though
often
severely
pecked
never
does
anything
but
dodge
and
pull
for
he
can
not
well
thrust
back
again
whilst
holding
a
fish
in
his
bill
and
his
whole
endeavour
is
to
avoid
losing
this
combats
however
are
very
frequent
amongst
guillemots
much
more
so
than
i
should
have
thought
the
condition
of
living
packed
closely
together
on
a
narrow
ledge
in
the
rock
would
have
allowed
for
surely
one
might
have
expected
that
this
necessity
would
have
been
a
power
making
for
peace
and
concord
that
it
has
been
so
to
some
extent
i
make
no
doubt
and
it
may
also
have
played
a
part
in
forming
the
character
of
the
fighting
which
is
or
at
least
it
struck
me
as
being
somewhat
peculiar
though
often
violent
it
is
not
as
a
rule
vindictive
and
as
it
seems
to
break
out
for
no
particular
reason
so
it
generally
ceases
suddenly
by
one
of
the
two
birds
stopping
as
it
were
in
and
commencing
to
preen
itself
after
which
it
may
be
resumed
once
or
twice
before
ceasing
finally
in
the
same
way
the
other
bird
seems
only
too
happy
to
be
left
in
peace
and
instead
of
pressing
the
assault
whilst
his
adversary
is
thus
engaged
and
at
a
momentary
disadvantage
generally
stands
unconcerned
or
begins
to
preen
himself
also
this
sudden
passing
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
from
war
to
the
toilette
has
a
curious
and
half
comic
effect
such
preening
under
such
circumstances
must
one
would
think
spring
from
a
powerful
incentive
and
it
is
i
believe
chiefly
when
annoyed
by
insects
that
the
birds
preen
themselves
though
whether
their
efforts
are
actually
to
free
themselves
of
these
or
only
to
allay
the
irritation
by
scratching
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
i
noticed
that
a
bird
would
often
bend
down
its
head
and
with
the
extreme
tip
of
its
bill
appear
minutely
to
explore
the
surface
of
its
webbed
feet
and
further
that
when
the
partner
of
a
bird
doing
this
was
beside
him
it
would
become
most
interested
and
do
its
best
to
assist
him
in
the
matter
one
may
suppose
that
the
ledge
which
is
of
course
coated
with
a
layer
of
guano
is
covered
with
these
pests
and
that
they
often
crawl
over
the
bird
feet
and
so
ascend
on
to
the
body
if
the
skin
of
the
feet
were
sensitive
their
owner
would
at
once
know
when
this
was
the
case
and
with
its
keen
eyesight
and
stiletto
bill
might
guard
itself
fairly
well
as
long
as
it
only
stood
as
however
all
the
birds
constantly
sit
flat
on
the
rock
even
when
not
incubating
the
searching
of
the
feet
can
be
of
little
or
no
real
importance
to
them
it
is
very
interesting
and
has
a
very
human
appearance
not
so
much
in
regard
to
the
particular
act
as
the
careful
look
and
manner
and
the
attitudes
assumed
to
see
two
birds
thus
helping
to
clean
each
other
feet
as
i
think
must
here
be
the
case
when
they
nibble
and
preen
each
other
they
may
as
a
rule
i
think
be
rightly
said
to
cosset
and
caress
the
expression
and
pose
of
the
bird
receiving
the
benefit
being
often
beatific
and
the
enjoyment
being
no
doubt
of
the
nature
of
that
which
a
parrot
receives
by
having
its
poll
scratched
though
with
regard
to
this
we
must
not
forget
the
look
of
supreme
satisfaction
which
a
monkey
often
has
whilst
a
friend
is
doing
his
best
to
make
him
clean
and
respectable
with
the
there
is
no
such
attitude
and
expression
the
bird
helped
is
at
the
same
time
an
active
agent
and
both
of
them
are
careful
earnest
and
investigatory
it
struck
me
however
that
the
chick
was
cosseted
in
a
somewhat
more
manner
as
though
if
not
actually
to
clean
it
at
least
to
make
it
spruce
and
tidy
it
seems
probable
indeed
that
the
conferring
a
practical
benefit
of
the
kind
indicated
may
be
one
origin
of
the
caress
throughout
nature
but
others
may
be
imagined
illustration
a
guillemot
the
usual
cause
of
guillemots
fighting
would
seem
to
be
one
of
them
moving
to
a
sufficient
degree
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
one
nearest
to
it
who
then
as
though
the
circumstances
permitted
of
no
other
course
delivers
a
vigorous
thrust
with
its
long
bill
this
is
the
usual
way
of
fighting
so
that
a
combat
has
something
the
appearance
of
a
the
two
birds
stand
upright
with
their
bodies
turned
more
sideways
towards
each
other
than
actually
fronting
so
that
their
heads
which
alone
do
so
are
twisted
a
little
round
they
stand
at
such
a
distance
apart
that
when
the
neck
is
held
straight
up
with
the
head
flying
out
at
a
right
angle
the
tips
of
their
two
long
lances
just
touch
so
that
the
birds
form
a
natural
archway
in
this
position
they
make
quick
repeated
thrusts
at
each
other
usually
directed
at
the
face
or
neck
by
a
motion
of
which
rather
than
by
parrying
with
the
beak
each
endeavours
to
avoid
the
lunge
of
its
adversary
but
besides
tilting
point
to
point
at
one
another
breasts
they
are
ready
to
seize
hold
of
each
other
should
the
opportunity
occur
and
when
the
fight
is
fierce
and
the
birds
in
their
eagerness
press
in
upon
each
other
they
then
strike
smartly
with
their
wings
sometimes
too
each
tries
to
seize
the
other
beak
but
this
is
not
usual
as
i
imagine
it
to
be
with
and
cormorants
these
single
combats
rarely
become
though
if
one
bird
is
forced
to
retreat
those
amongst
whom
he
pushes
will
be
ready
to
peck
at
him
and
at
each
other
of
course
a
bird
if
really
in
distress
can
always
fly
down
from
the
ledge
into
the
sea
and
this
it
is
often
forced
to
do
if
it
has
been
standing
near
the
edge
when
the
combat
broke
out
the
bird
seems
then
to
recognise
its
advantage
and
presses
boldly
forward
upon
the
other
there
is
a
short
retreat
a
recognition
of
the
danger
and
vigorous
rally
another
forced
step
backwards
an
ineffectual
whirring
of
wings
on
the
extreme
brink
and
turning
in
the
moment
of
falling
the
discomfited
one
renounces
all
further
effort
and
plunges
into
the
abyss
and
no
doubt
the
little
lice
who
crawl
about
upon
the
ledge
and
see
such
mighty
doings
would
were
they
poets
write
long
epics
telling
of
the
wars
and
falls
of
angels
but
only
combats
on
the
brink
have
such
dramatic
terminations
and
farther
inland
a
fight
must
be
of
an
exceptionally
violent
kind
to
make
the
birds
not
think
of
preening
themselves
and
thus
bring
it
to
an
end
birds
that
are
incubating
will
fight
as
well
as
the
others
and
no
respect
seems
to
be
paid
to
them
on
this
account
often
one
thus
occupied
may
be
seen
thrusting
up
at
a
standing
bird
who
in
turn
thrusts
down
at
it
or
two
recumbent
ones
will
spar
vigorously
at
each
other
one
wonders
that
under
these
circumstances
the
eggs
are
not
sometimes
broken
as
may
possibly
be
the
case
but
with
regard
to
this
i
will
here
quote
the
following
note
which
i
made
on
the
management
of
the
egg
during
incubation
it
appears
to
me
that
the
guillemot
sits
with
the
egg
not
only
between
its
legs
but
resting
on
the
two
webbed
feet
and
pressed
slightly
by
them
against
the
breast
at
any
rate
i
have
just
distinctly
seen
the
bird
rise
up
take
the
egg
carefully
in
this
way
between
its
two
feet
sliding
them
underneath
it
and
then
sink
gently
down
upon
it
again
i
believe
that
the
egg
was
so
placed
when
the
bird
rose
and
that
it
rose
for
the
purpose
of
improving
its
position
it
seems
likely
that
if
the
egg
rests
upon
the
bird
feet
instead
of
on
the
bare
rock
it
must
be
less
liable
to
fracture
and
could
be
pressed
slightly
up
by
the
bird
amongst
its
feathers
so
that
the
two
opposed
pressures
could
be
combined
to
advantage
or
either
of
them
relaxed
when
it
was
to
the
bird
convenience
have
just
seen
another
sitting
bird
rise
and
in
settling
down
again
she
certainly
seemed
to
place
her
feet
under
the
egg
assisting
at
the
same
time
to
place
it
with
the
bill
when
she
rose
the
partner
bird
came
forward
to
her
and
lowering
his
head
looked
at
the
egg
with
the
tenderest
interest
then
cosseted
her
as
she
stood
and
again
when
she
had
resettled
another
bird
has
half
risen
showing
the
egg
quite
plainly
it
is
certainly
resting
on
the
feet
guillemots
as
is
well
known
lay
their
single
egg
on
the
bare
rock
but
sometimes
they
will
pick
up
and
play
with
a
feather
and
i
have
seen
one
carry
some
fibres
of
grass
or
root
which
had
perhaps
fallen
or
been
blown
from
a
kittiwake
nest
to
its
partner
and
lay
them
down
as
if
showing
her
in
such
acts
we
may
perhaps
see
a
lingering
trace
of
a
lost
instinct
they
walk
as
a
rule
with
the
whole
shank
as
well
as
the
actual
foot
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
but
sometimes
they
will
draw
themselves
up
so
that
they
stand
upon
the
foot
or
rather
the
toes
alone
just
in
the
way
in
which
a
penguin
does
and
in
this
attitude
they
can
both
walk
and
run
anatomically
speaking
the
shank
is
i
believe
a
part
of
the
foot
corresponding
to
our
own
heel
and
functionally
it
is
so
too
in
the
guillemot
as
well
as
in
the
razorbill
and
puffin
it
is
interesting
therefore
to
see
the
occasional
assumption
of
an
attitude
which
in
the
penguins
has
become
habitual
their
ordinary
walking
attitude
is
with
the
head
held
erect
but
they
often
sink
it
to
or
below
the
breast
at
the
same
time
craning
the
neck
right
forward
which
gives
them
a
grotesque
and
uncanny
appearance
like
one
of
the
evil
creatures
in
retche
outlines
of
faust
again
one
of
them
will
sometimes
throw
the
head
and
neck
slightly
forward
and
at
the
same
time
jerking
the
wings
sharply
behind
the
back
will
after
remaining
with
them
thus
set
for
a
moment
run
briskly
forward
giving
them
a
vigorous
shaking
but
in
spite
of
wings
and
beaks
and
a
few
other
dissimilarities
it
is
of
men
that
one
has
to
think
when
watching
these
erect
funny
little
bodies
indeed
they
are
much
like
us
for
they
fight
love
breed
eat
and
stand
upright
which
is
most
of
what
we
do
though
we
make
so
much
more
pother
about
it
but
it
has
a
funny
effect
to
see
it
all
going
on
like
a
picture
in
little
on
a
ledge
of
the
bare
rock
if
guillemots
are
watched
closely
one
may
be
noticed
now
and
again
to
scrape
with
its
beak
for
some
time
at
the
ledge
where
it
is
lying
opening
and
closing
its
mandibles
upon
it
every
now
and
then
as
i
make
it
out
it
encloses
a
small
object
between
them
which
must
i
think
be
a
piece
of
the
rock
and
with
a
quick
jerk
of
the
head
sideways
and
upwards
swallows
this
this
then
is
how
guillemots
procure
the
small
stones
which
are
no
doubt
necessary
to
them
for
digestive
purposes
the
great
mass
of
the
rock
forming
the
island
is
sedimentary
and
in
a
more
or
less
crumbling
state
much
of
it
indeed
quite
rotten
and
dangerous
to
trust
to
i
will
conclude
this
slight
picture
of
life
on
a
ledge
with
a
few
lines
from
my
notes
as
taken
during
that
short
period
which
in
summer
best
answers
to
the
coming
on
of
night
and
dawn
of
morning
here
in
england
some
dozen
birds
out
of
about
thirty
that
i
can
see
appear
to
be
roosting
the
kittiwakes
are
more
silent
than
in
broad
day
though
there
is
a
burst
of
clamour
now
and
again
there
is
less
activity
now
but
few
birds
seem
thoroughly
asleep
many
stand
and
some
occasionally
walk
about
and
flap
their
wings
one
has
just
flown
off
the
ledge
but
no
others
are
doing
so
nor
are
any
arriving
upon
it
the
general
scene
is
much
quieter
and
so
with
the
kittiwakes
the
ledge
now
at
past
eleven
is
very
quiet
though
the
majority
of
the
birds
still
stand
and
some
preen
themselves
the
glasses
have
become
inferior
to
the
naked
eye
though
one
can
read
anything
with
perfect
ease
the
birds
it
is
evident
judge
of
night
by
the
light
they
do
not
make
a
factitious
night
according
to
the
duration
of
time
they
sleep
indeed
in
patches
but
on
the
whole
would
seem
to
do
so
very
little
in
the
hours
the
majority
of
the
birds
are
now
roosting
perhaps
almost
all
i
can
see
no
puffins
they
must
therefore
it
seems
lie
roosting
too
in
holes
or
crevices
of
the
rocks
all
quiet
at
shipka
a
bird
flies
in
duskily
from
the
sea
and
now
no
fighting
ensues
all
is
quiet
at
shipka
all
quiet
at
shipka
a
little
more
so
perhaps
as
before
much
as
before
but
two
birds
are
i
think
cosseting
though
one
can
read
and
write
with
ease
and
see
all
objects
even
birds
sitting
or
flying
a
long
way
off
still
it
is
all
gloom
and
yellow
murkiness
light
seems
gone
though
there
be
light
it
is
visible
indeed
neither
true
night
nor
true
day
but
more
like
night
than
day
the
great
shapes
of
cliff
and
hill
seem
drawn
in
gloom
clearly
the
sea
gleams
dimly
and
duskily
all
is
weird
strange
and
portentous
it
is
the
marriage
of
opposite
kingdoms
or
rather
the
monstrous
child
of
light
and
darkness
all
roosting
i
think
quiet
now
all
quiet
at
shipka
much
as
before
on
the
steep
side
of
one
of
the
great
opposite
kittiwakes
are
roosting
in
the
most
extraordinary
numbers
and
so
close
together
that
they
look
not
like
birds
but
some
outcrop
on
the
surface
of
the
rock
they
consist
no
doubt
of
the
partners
of
all
the
sitting
birds
on
the
ledges
the
ledge
is
now
stirring
into
life
again
and
so
too
the
great
block
of
kittiwakes
on
the
from
which
birds
keep
dashing
out
whirling
and
circling
settling
again
or
visiting
their
sitting
partners
on
the
nests
before
flying
back
to
it
but
the
clamour
of
voices
is
as
yet
slight
now
at
it
is
beginning
to
be
greater
a
general
preening
amongst
the
guillemots
though
a
good
many
still
lie
asleep
but
soon
they
wake
too
and
begin
for
now
it
is
light
bright
and
morning

watching
birds
at
a
one
of
the
most
interesting
ways
of
watching
birds
at
very
close
quarters
is
to
conceal
oneself
in
one
of
the
or
that
in
the
autumn
begin
to
spring
up
like
mushrooms
all
over
the
this
is
a
winter
pastime
and
the
harder
the
weather
the
greater
will
be
the
results
yielded
to
have
chaffinches
greenfinches
bramblings
buntings
starlings
perhaps
a
blackbird
or
two
pheasants
and
partridges
all
about
one
and
quite
near
one
should
choose
a
bitterly
cold
day
with
a
biting
wind
driving
the
snowflakes
before
it
and
the
snow
itself
whitening
the
landscape
but
not
so
deeply
as
to
cover
things
beyond
a
bird
power
of
scratching
rising
early
one
gets
to
the
stack
whilst
it
is
still
dark
at
one
side
there
is
always
a
great
heap
of
refuse
material
of
the
stack
threshed
ears
of
corn
chopped
and
winnowed
straw
as
well
as
at
least
where
picturesque
farming
prevails
and
may
it
long
prevail
a
vast
quantity
of
campion
columbine
and
all
sorts
of
other
plants
and
flowers
that
have
been
garnered
in
with
the
harvest
small
birds
come
down
on
this
in
flocks
and
where
the
slope
of
the
heap
on
one
side
joins
the
stack
one
should
make
in
the
latter
by
a
process
of
pulling
out
and
pressing
in
a
nice
cosy
cavern
just
big
enough
to
squeeze
into
on
the
floor
of
this
one
should
lay
a
shawl
or
plaid
and
then
enveloping
oneself
in
another
enter
it
backwards
and
kicking
one
legs
farther
into
the
body
of
the
stack
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
pull
down
the
straw
over
the
aperture
arranging
it
thinly
just
in
front
of
one
face
so
as
to
have
a
good
outlook
even
on
the
coldest
morning
one
is
warm
and
comfortable
under
such
circumstances
and
the
snow
without
and
frosted
stalks
that
one
near
breath
is
thawing
make
one
feel
all
the
warmer
it
is
for
warmth
indeed
that
such
an
ensconcement
is
principally
needed
for
on
days
like
this
small
birds
at
any
rate
will
come
within
a
few
paces
of
one
if
only
one
sits
still
even
when
one
walks
up
to
the
stack
in
broad
daylight
they
only
fly
round
to
another
side
of
it
and
one
has
scarcely
settled
oneself
before
they
begin
to
come
again
but
hidden
thus
before
black
night
has
ceased
to
steal
the
colours
from
things
one
may
have
stragglers
from
the
main
crowd
within
the
length
of
one
arm
and
i
have
even
tried
catching
one
for
the
bizarrerie
of
the
thing
by
gliding
my
hand
stealthily
through
the
loose
straw
underneath
it
the
attempt
failed
but
i
believe
such
a
feat
would
be
quite
possible
as
the
light
begins
to
creep
upon
the
darkness
and
the
world
to
grow
more
and
more
white
the
arrivals
commence
first
a
few
greenfinches
principally
hens
fly
down
upon
the
heap
then
chaffinches
both
cocks
and
hens
but
hens
predominating
with
a
few
mostly
of
immature
plumage
and
a
or
two
these
birds
come
and
go
independently
for
some
little
time
and
it
is
not
till
the
morning
has
grown
lighter
that
they
begin
to
form
a
band
in
the
sense
not
of
their
numbers
only
but
also
of
their
actions
it
is
only
gradually
for
instance
that
their
habit
of
all
flying
away
together
into
the
neighbouring
trees
and
returning
quickly
again
in
the
same
way
becomes
at
all
marked
they
are
at
first
independent
units
but
as
the
day
brightens
and
the
numbers
increase
they
become
more
and
more
interdependent
now
too
there
is
more
equality
in
the
numbers
of
the
sexes
the
females
still
predominate
but
one
would
not
always
think
that
this
was
the
case
for
as
they
all
whirr
into
a
large
oak
tree
that
is
beginning
now
to
be
gilded
by
the
beams
of
the
sun
its
bare
boughs
and
twigs
as
well
as
the
surrounding
bushes
are
made
suddenly
lovely
with
bright
soft
green
and
red
a
glorious
winter
foliage
this
that
might
make
an
old
tree
feel
young
again
all
the
time
the
birds
are
down
on
the
heap
they
are
busily
feeding
seeming
to
put
their
whole
soul
into
each
peck
like
the
single
jest
at
the
mermaid
and
all
in
a
kind
of
sociable
yet
but
half
friendly
competition
with
each
other
gradually
they
spread
out
a
little
from
the
heap
greenfinches
are
amongst
the
straw
that
one
has
oneself
pulled
out
from
the
stack
and
one
of
them
is
feeding
positively
within
three
feet
to
see
them
so
near
and
to
think
that
they
think
you
anywhere
rather
than
where
you
are
it
is
like
eavesdropping
it
hardly
seems
right
now
the
nearest
greenfinch
picks
out
an
ear
of
the
corn
and
as
if
to
show
you
just
how
he
does
it
comes
even
a
thought
nearer
he
turns
it
till
it
is
crosswise
in
his
beak
snips
off
the
stalk
rapidly
divests
it
of
what
remains
of
the
outer
huskiness
in
doing
which
you
see
him
work
his
mandibles
in
a
delicate
tactile
manner
and
swallows
the
inner
essence
throughout
he
does
not
help
himself
with
his
claws
at
all
it
is
pleasant
to
see
this
but
still
more
so
to
have
so
many
little
dicky
birds
just
within
a
pace
or
two
all
free
and
unconstrained
and
knowing
nothing
whatever
about
it
it
is
as
if
you
had
somehow
got
into
a
without
alarming
the
inmates
but
even
as
this
occurs
to
you
you
recognise
the
poverty
of
the
simile
and
rejoice
to
be
in
nature
aviary
at
least
one
may
say
this
of
the
birds
if
not
of
the
there
is
now
besides
chaffinches
and
greenfinches
which
form
the
great
bulk
of
the
numbers
quite
a
little
crowd
of
bramblings
twenty
or
more
their
beautiful
plumage
gleaming
out
in
an
easy
of
colour
for
they
are
indeed
much
handsomer
than
the
handsomest
cock
chaffinch
or
greenfinch
and
as
both
the
sexes
are
alike
nothing
of
them
is
lost
there
are
no
even
the
when
at
their
yellowest
can
not
compete
with
these
chestnut
beauties
and
the
pretty
little
who
feed
softly
two
or
three
together
on
the
poppy
seeds
are
beaten
whether
they
confess
it
or
not
a
or
two
hopping
very
quietly
and
unobtrusively
about
on
the
outskirts
of
the
great
central
crowd
have
of
course
no
pretensions
to
anything
like
distinguished
beauty
but
there
is
one
bird
one
unfortunately
not
only
as
a
species
but
individually
that
may
perhaps
stand
up
in
rivalry
even
with
the
brambling
this
is
a
solitary
male
goldfinch
who
as
though
knowing
the
sad
and
waning
state
of
his
clan
feeds
all
by
himself
and
as
one
seems
to
fancy
in
a
melancholy
manner
be
this
as
it
may
his
mode
of
feeding
is
quite
different
to
that
of
the
other
birds
whilst
all
or
nearly
all
of
these
are
pecking
odds
and
ends
from
amongst
the
straw
and
draff
of
the
heap
using
their
beaks
only
and
seeming
to
swallow
something
at
each
little
peck
like
chickens
with
grain
he
makes
successive
little
excursions
to
the
stack
itself
from
which
he
extracts
a
blade
of
corn
a
campion
or
a
and
then
standing
with
the
claws
of
both
his
feet
grasping
it
like
a
crow
with
a
piece
of
carrion
picks
it
to
pieces
and
devours
it
or
the
seeds
it
contains
in
a
leisurely
almost
a
phlegmatic
way
this
is
quite
different
from
the
greenfinch
which
as
just
seen
in
extracting
the
grain
from
an
ear
of
corn
uses
only
its
bill
standing
the
while
in
an
ordinary
upright
attitude
and
not
down
upon
it
as
it
lies
along
the
ground
perhaps
the
goldfinch
can
do
this
too
but
as
this
particular
one
did
not
on
any
morning
employ
a
different
method
to
that
which
i
have
described
it
must
i
should
think
be
the
usual
one
nor
did
i
ever
see
it
pecking
up
anything
from
the
ground
in
a
careless
haphazard
fashion
like
the
other
birds
one
can
feed
the
birds
with
bread
if
one
likes
and
when
found
and
tasted
this
is
appreciated
but
the
pieces
that
one
throws
are
not
noticed
as
they
lie
amongst
the
straw
so
readily
as
one
would
have
supposed
and
often
birds
will
pass
quite
near
to
or
even
almost
touch
them
without
seeing
them
or
at
least
discovering
what
they
are
a
whole
osborne
biscuit
upon
one
occasion
was
an
object
of
suspicion
several
chaffinches
came
up
as
though
to
peck
at
it
but
their
courage
failed
them
at
the
last
moment
and
it
was
never
touched
the
whole
time
i
was
there
of
course
when
larger
and
more
wary
birds
come
to
the
stack
one
must
keep
quite
still
and
not
play
any
tricks
like
these
if
one
wishes
them
to
stay
a
hen
blackbird
is
now
feeding
on
the
outskirts
of
the
heap
she
will
not
permit
any
small
birds
to
be
near
her
but
drives
them
all
off
if
they
come
within
a
certain
distance
so
that
she
is
soon
in
the
centre
of
a
little
space
which
she
has
all
to
herself
into
this
a
starling
flies
down
and
seems
at
first
inclined
to
meet
the
blackbird
on
equal
terms
for
of
course
the
two
instantly
recognise
each
other
as
rivals
and
cross
swords
as
by
mutual
desire
but
even
in
the
first
encounter
the
starling
has
to
give
way
and
then
beats
a
series
of
retreats
before
the
other
sprightly
little
rushes
till
at
length
being
left
no
peace
he
has
to
fly
away
later
some
starlings
come
down
together
almost
on
the
top
of
the
heap
and
feed
in
just
the
same
way
as
the
small
birds
they
alight
amongst
soon
there
is
a
combat
between
two
of
these
both
keep
springing
from
the
ground
going
up
again
the
instant
they
alight
and
each
trying
as
it
seems
to
jump
above
the
other
whether
to
avoid
pecks
delivered
or
the
better
to
deliver
them
they
never
jump
quite
at
the
same
time
but
always
one
goes
up
as
the
other
comes
down
which
has
a
funny
effect
they
never
close
or
grapple
they
do
not
even
to
do
much
pecking
and
when
it
is
all
over
neither
of
them
seems
one
penny
the
worse
the
great
thing
evidently
is
to
jump
and
as
long
as
a
bird
can
do
it
he
has
no
cause
to
be
dissatisfied
it
is
delightful
to
watch
them
from
so
close
one
can
see
the
gleam
of
each
feather
catch
their
very
expressions
and
sympathise
with
every
spring
they
look
very
thin
and
elegant
and
their
plumage
is
all
gloss
and
sheen
all
the
while
they
keep
uttering
a
sort
of
squealing
note
which
it
is
quite
enchanting
to
hear
a
few
partridges
now
come
down
over
the
thin
snow
towards
the
stack
at
first
fast
with
a
pause
between
each
run
during
which
they
draw
themselves
up
and
throw
the
head
and
neck
a
little
back
then
they
seem
to
waver
in
their
intention
and
whilst
one
pecks
at
the
body
of
a
frosted
swede
another
bends
above
it
and
sips
with
a
delicate
bill
a
little
of
the
rime
upon
its
leaves
then
they
come
on
again
but
as
they
near
the
stack
with
slower
and
more
hesitating
steps
and
no
longer
uttering
their
curious
grating
cry
instead
one
hears
now
for
now
they
are
in
close
proximity
all
sorts
of
pretty
little
soft
croodling
sounds
seeming
to
express
contentment
and
happiness
with
a
quiet
of
affection
then
they
feed
quietly
on
the
frontiers
of
their
winter
oasis
all
at
once
something
gorgeous
and
burnished
steals
and
then
flashes
into
sight
it
is
a
pheasant
he
has
come
invisibly
from
another
direction
and
ascending
the
opposite
slope
of
the
great
rises
over
it
like
a
second
sun
surely
such
splendour
should
come
striding
in
majesty
but
he
is
very
nervous
full
of
apprehension
open
to
the
very
smallest
ground
of
fear
or
suspicion
often
he
stops
and
looks
anxiously
about
half
crouches
then
makes
a
little
start
forward
with
the
body
as
though
on
the
point
of
running
but
checks
himself
each
time
and
begins
to
peck
instead
sometimes
he
draws
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looks
all
round
as
from
a
but
after
each
fit
of
fear
he
decides
that
all
is
well
and
goes
on
feeding
again
and
now
another
sun
rises
and
immediately
afterwards
three
no
four
dazzle
my
eyes
or
do
i
see
suns
advance
together
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
which
though
of
straw
and
all
inflammable
materials
does
not
a
miracle
take
fire
and
burn
but
the
snow
and
the
dampness
must
be
taken
into
consideration
all
of
them
are
now
feeding
quietly
but
not
all
together
or
in
view
two
have
set
again
but
three
and
the
tail
of
another
in
partial
eclipse
from
behind
is
a
sight
of
sufficient
magnificence
looking
at
them
at
their
splendid
of
burnished
orange
gold
gleaming
even
in
the
dull
morning
without
any
sun
but
themselves
for
the
great
one
is
now
at
their
glossy
blue
heads
rich
scarlet
wattles
and
long
graceful
tails
one
can
not
help
wondering
beautiful
a
bird
would
have
to
be
before
compunction
would
be
felt
in
killing
it
would
the
golden
or
amherst
pheasant
produce
the
sensation
idle
thought
peacocks
are
shot
in
india
trogons
in
mexico
both
there
and
in
the
brazils
and
birds
of
paradise
in
the
islands
of
the
east
of
paradise
then
are
there
birds
in
heaven
and
do
our
sainted
women
wear
feathers
but
such
speculations
are
beyond
the
province
of
this
work
now
the
feeding
goes
on
apace
all
the
splendid
birds
keep
scratching
backwards
in
the
as
do
fowls
sending
up
clouds
of
it
into
the
air
like
the
partridges
too
they
utter
from
time
to
time
a
variety
of
curious
low
notes
which
unless
one
were
quite
near
one
would
never
hear
and
once
they
make
a
quick
little
piping
sound
all
together
standing
and
lifting
up
their
heads
to
do
it
as
though
filled
with
mutual
satisfaction
and
a
friendly
feeling
the
low
sounds
are
of
a
croodling
or
clucking
character
they
are
not
quite
so
soft
as
those
of
the
partridges
and
low
as
they
are
one
still
catches
in
them
that
quality
of
tone
whereof
the
loud
trumpety
notes
are
made
i
have
spoken
of
the
extreme
nervousness
of
the
first
pheasant
the
later
arrivals
just
as
would
be
the
case
with
men
were
not
nearly
so
nervous
though
all
were
wary
and
circumspect
but
now
it
is
most
interesting
to
watch
them
and
to
remark
how
in
these
cautious
birds
timidity
or
say
rather
a
proper
and
most
necessary
prudence
is
tempered
with
judgment
and
modified
by
individual
character
or
temperament
they
are
capable
of
withstanding
the
first
sudden
impulse
to
flight
and
of
subjecting
it
to
reason
and
a
more
prolonged
observation
thus
when
the
small
birds
fly
suddenly
off
in
a
cloud
as
they
do
every
few
minutes
and
with
a
great
whirr
of
wings
the
pheasants
all
stop
feeding
look
about
pause
a
little
seeming
to
consider
and
then
recommence
as
though
they
had
decided
that
such
panic
fear
was
uncalled
for
and
that
there
was
no
rational
ground
for
alarm
an
hour
or
two
later
three
out
of
the
four
birds
for
two
have
got
gradually
to
the
other
side
of
the
stack
see
enough
of
me
in
the
straw
to
make
them
suspicious
and
go
off
at
half
pace
the
fourth
bird
notes
their
retreat
looks
all
about
can
see
nothing
to
account
for
it
and
instead
of
following
them
as
might
have
been
expected
goes
on
feeding
this
though
it
may
seem
to
show
a
defect
in
the
reasoning
power
the
power
itself
it
certainly
does
show
at
least
argues
strength
of
character
and
independence
of
judgment
a
certain
line
of
conduct
is
suggested
by
the
action
of
a
bird
three
companions
but
this
suggestion
this
powerful
stimulus
one
would
think
is
resisted
by
the
one
bird
put
to
the
test
of
its
own
powers
of
observation
and
the
line
of
conduct
dictated
by
it
rejected
this
quality
and
power
of
not
being
swayed
by
others
i
have
constantly
observed
in
birds
as
will
have
been
gathered
these
six
pheasants
that
came
and
fed
together
at
the
stack
were
all
males
and
this
has
been
my
usual
experience
under
such
circumstances
i
have
always
found
them
agree
together
perfectly
well
but
there
is
generally
some
fighting
to
be
seen
amongst
the
small
birds
though
perhaps
not
much
if
one
takes
their
numbers
into
consideration
chaffinches
are
the
most
pugnacious
though
here
again
a
similar
allowance
must
be
made
for
they
largely
predominate
even
over
greenfinches
whilst
compared
to
these
two
the
others
excepting
sometimes
bramblings
are
only
scantily
represented
chaffinches
fight
by
springing
up
from
the
ground
against
each
other
breast
to
breast
as
do
so
many
birds
and
they
may
rise
thus
to
a
considerable
height
each
trying
to
get
above
the
other
and
claw
or
peck
down
upon
it
at
least
it
would
seem
so
their
position
in
the
air
is
thus
perpendicular
and
as
they
mutually
impede
each
other
they
are
more
fluttering
than
flying
sometimes
however
generally
after
they
have
got
to
a
little
height
they
will
disengage
and
then
there
will
be
between
them
a
series
of
alternate
little
flights
up
and
above
and
swoops
down
upon
each
other
very
inspiriting
to
see
sometimes
they
will
commence
the
fight
with
these
swoopings
but
it
is
more
common
for
them
to
flutter
perpendicularly
up
as
described
and
then
down
again
often
too
they
will
rise
beak
to
beak
only
the
position
being
then
between
perpendicular
and
horizontal
but
more
the
latter
the
tail
part
of
them
giving
constant
little
flirts
upwards
as
when
a
volatile
italian
in
an
umbrella
shop
leans
his
whole
weight
on
the
stick
of
one
of
the
umbrellas
and
leaps
or
rather
swings
himself
from
the
ground
kicking
his
heels
into
the
air
to
demonstrate
its
strength
imagine
two
volatile
italians
thus
testing
two
umbrellas
whose
handles
touch
continually
throwing
up
their
heels
rising
a
little
as
they
do
so
never
coming
quite
down
again
and
so
getting
a
little
higher
each
time
and
you
have
the
two
chaffinches
or
there
will
be
a
series
of
alternate
flying
jumps
from
the
ground
like
the
starling
but
more
aerial
these
are
the
more
usual
ways
but
if
one
bird
can
whilst
on
the
ground
suddenly
seize
another
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
then
getting
on
his
back
twist
his
beak
about
in
the
skin
and
feathers
it
is
all
the
better
for
that
one
such
fights
as
these
are
usually
between
two
male
birds
but
hen
chaffinches
sometimes
fight
whilst
scuffles
between
a
cock
and
a
hen
over
food
may
also
be
witnessed
greenfinches
fight
in
much
the
same
manner
but
they
are
more
stoutly
built
and
their
motions
are
not
quite
so
brisk
and
airy
though
chaffinches
themselves
are
but
clumsy
birds
in
this
respect
compared
to
many
others
larks
for
example
they
too
fight
tenaciously
after
a
brisk
in
the
air
i
have
seen
one
on
their
falling
together
seize
the
other
by
the
nape
and
be
dragged
about
by
it
over
the
snow
but
what
has
interested
me
more
than
anything
else
in
my
frequent
watchings
of
small
birds
congregated
together
at
the
stacks
is
the
way
in
which
every
few
minutes
or
so
sometimes
at
longer
and
sometimes
at
shorter
intervals
they
take
instant
and
simultaneous
flight
rising
all
together
with
a
sudden
whirr
of
wings
and
flurrying
away
to
some
near
tree
or
trees
or
into
the
hedgerow
to
return
in
a
much
more
scattered
and
gradual
manner
very
soon
sometimes
almost
directly
afterwards
these
sudden
spontaneous
flights
where
one
and
the
same
thought
seems
suddenly
to
take
possession
of
a
whole
assembly
of
beings
i
had
before
and
have
often
afterwards
observed
in
rooks
starlings
and
i
have
been
equally
puzzled
to
account
for
it
in
all
of
them
i
do
not
remember
that
this
habit
which
is
indeed
common
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
to
a
very
great
number
of
birds
has
ever
been
brought
forward
as
something
difficult
of
explanation
and
many
perhaps
will
doubt
there
being
any
such
difficulty
in
regard
to
a
thing
so
ordinary
and
commonplace
as
to
this
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
arrived
at
a
different
conclusion
this
is
the
effect
produced
but
for
greater
accuracy
see
what
would
be
the
ordinary
way
of
accounting
for
such
sudden
and
simultaneous
taking
to
flight
of
a
number
of
birds
one
may
suppose
in
the
first
place
that
a
particular
note
is
uttered
by
one
or
more
of
them
on
the
espial
of
danger
and
that
this
acts
as
a
to
the
rest
this
seems
a
satisfactory
explanation
but
as
against
it
no
such
note
is
as
a
rule
uttered
and
even
if
it
were
it
would
not
account
for
all
the
facts
as
i
have
often
observed
them
day
after
day
and
for
hours
at
a
time
i
have
watched
these
crowds
of
little
birds
under
the
circumstances
described
and
only
on
one
single
occasion
was
the
sudden
rising
into
the
air
in
flight
preceded
by
any
note
at
all
nor
did
i
observe
anything
i
do
not
believe
there
was
anything
to
be
observed
which
could
have
frightened
them
in
the
one
case
referred
to
which
was
different
the
flight
was
certainly
preceded
by
a
note
a
very
peculiar
one
single
long
and
remarkably
loud
taking
the
size
of
the
birds
into
consideration
it
suggested
somewhat
the
sudden
blowing
of
a
horn
though
of
course
a
small
one
i
could
not
tell
which
bird
uttered
it
but
feel
sure
from
the
quality
of
the
tone
that
it
was
a
greenfinch
to
the
best
of
my
observation
the
note
was
uttered
before
the
flight
commenced
and
the
flight
followed
before
it
had
ceased
almost
immediately
afterwards
i
heard
for
the
first
time
the
caw
of
rooks
and
my
theory
is
or
was
that
one
of
these
appearing
suddenly
in
the
air
from
the
back
of
the
had
been
mistaken
for
a
hawk
and
that
the
bird
so
mistaking
it
had
immediately
uttered
the
appropriate
warning
note
unfortunately
for
my
little
mouse
theories
says
voltaire
are
like
mice
they
run
through
nineteen
holes
but
are
stopped
by
the
twentieth
only
the
other
day
when
i
was
at
the
same
place
and
equally
near
a
genuine
hawk
a
sparrow
one
had
flown
by
when
instead
of
a
warning
note
there
had
been
a
sudden
hush
and
silence
followed
by
a
flight
which
as
it
seemed
to
me
was
not
so
close
and
compact
as
usual
difficulties
of
this
sort
are
always
occurring
in
observation
at
least
in
my
observation
and
show
how
cautious
one
should
be
in
translating
the
particular
into
the
general
for
instance
with
i
have
noted
that
in
one
or
two
of
their
many
timorous
flights
to
the
river
a
peculiar
cry
was
uttered
by
a
single
bird
which
had
all
the
appearance
and
seemed
to
have
all
the
probability
of
being
a
warning
note
but
this
was
not
the
case
on
other
occasions
even
here
then
there
is
some
difficulty
in
accepting
the
theory
of
a
uttered
by
one
bird
and
causing
the
simultaneous
flight
of
all
whilst
in
all
other
instances
i
am
speaking
now
of
small
birds
at
the
stacks
either
no
note
at
all
or
none
distinguishable
from
a
general
chirping
was
uttered
manifestly
then
this
explanation
will
not
serve
but
it
may
be
said
either
that
there
is
a
leader
whose
movements
all
the
birds
follow
or
that
when
one
bird
flies
for
whatever
reason
the
rest
take
alarm
and
fly
also
but
where
different
species
of
birds
are
all
banded
together
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
there
should
be
a
leader
and
both
this
and
the
other
explanation
which
at
first
sight
seems
satisfactory
are
destroyed
by
the
salient
fact
that
in
hardly
any
case
do
the
birds
rise
and
fly
away
together
but
only
the
great
majority
almost
invariably
a
certain
number
of
them
though
sometimes
only
or
so
or
even
less
remain
nor
has
this
anything
to
do
with
the
particular
species
of
bird
moreover
the
flying
up
of
any
bird
from
the
crowd
does
not
of
itself
communicate
alarm
to
the
others
for
first
one
and
then
another
and
often
several
at
a
time
may
constantly
be
doing
so
whilst
the
rest
feed
quietly
and
take
no
notice
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
only
when
a
bird
flies
off
in
alarm
that
its
flight
communicates
alarm
to
its
companions
that
it
does
so
necessarily
even
in
such
a
case
i
from
general
observation
very
much
doubt
and
also
if
the
facts
as
i
have
given
them
be
a
little
considered
it
will
be
seen
that
the
difficulties
are
not
met
by
this
view
of
the
case
my
very
close
proximity
must
be
taken
into
account
the
theory
of
a
leader
seems
more
applicable
to
birds
like
rooks
which
are
gregarious
and
may
be
constantly
watched
in
large
numbers
together
without
the
intermixture
of
any
other
species
the
same
difficulties
however
apply
here
and
even
to
a
greater
extent
for
the
movements
of
rooks
are
more
complicated
whilst
alarm
or
any
such
primary
impulse
as
the
origin
i
do
not
say
the
explanation
of
them
is
in
most
cases
quite
out
of
the
question
an
instance
or
two
of
these
sudden
and
quite
simultaneous
movements
of
bodies
of
rooks
i
have
noted
down
directly
after
observing
them
they
would
be
much
in
place
here
but
as
i
have
two
chapters
devoted
to
these
birds
and
moreover
as
they
but
make
a
part
in
general
scenes
and
pictures
i
will
not
separate
them
from
their
context
nor
any
bird
from
its
companions
starlings
again
furnish
striking
examples
of
the
same
phenomenon
their
aerial
evolutions
before
roosting
are
sufficiently
remarkable
but
perhaps
still
more
so
from
this
point
of
view
is
the
manner
in
which
they
leave
the
in
the
morning
this
is
not
in
one
great
body
as
might
have
been
expected
but
in
successive
flights
at
intervals
of
some
three
or
four
to
ten
or
twelve
minutes
each
flight
comprising
sometimes
hundreds
of
thousands
of
birds
the
numbers
of
course
will
vary
in
different
localities
and
the
whole
exodus
occupying
about
each
of
these
great
flights
or
uprushes
from
the
dense
brake
of
bush
and
undergrowth
where
the
birds
are
congregated
takes
place
with
startling
suddenness
and
it
seems
as
though
every
individual
bird
composing
it
were
linked
to
every
other
by
some
invisible
material
as
are
knots
on
the
meshes
of
a
net
by
the
visible
twine
connecting
them
there
is
no
preliminary
nor
does
it
seem
as
though
a
certain
number
of
more
restless
individuals
gradually
affected
others
but
at
once
a
huge
mass
roars
up
from
the
still
more
immense
multitude
as
does
a
wave
from
the
sea
or
as
a
sudden
cloud
of
dust
is
puffed
by
the
wind
from
a
i
am
speaking
here
of
the
great
main
flights
which
are
in
most
cases
of
this
character
the
fact
that
quite
small
bands
of
birds
will
sometimes
fly
off
between
the
intervals
of
these
does
not
detract
from
the
more
striking
phenomenon
or
lessen
the
difficulty
of
explaining
it
for
surely
there
a
difficulty
in
explaining
how
the
example
of
one
vast
body
of
birds
soaring
forth
on
the
morning
flight
should
not
affect
every
individual
of
the
still
vaster
body
of
which
they
form
a
part
the
whole
occupying
it
must
be
remembered
a
small
and
densely
packed
area
and
why
the
impulse
of
the
flying
birds
to
fly
should
apparently
become
uncontrollable
in
each
individual
of
them
at
the
same
instant
of
time
if
we
saw
soldiers
issuing
in
this
manner
from
an
encampment
or
performing
all
sorts
of
collective
movements
and
evolutions
before
entering
it
in
the
evening
as
do
the
starlings
before
descending
on
their
roosting
place
and
yet
satisfied
ourselves
that
there
were
neither
captains
nor
officers
signals
nor
words
of
command
amongst
them
we
should
probably
wonder
and
might
think
the
phenomenon
sufficiently
curious
to
make
it
worth
study
and
investigation
as
far
at
least
as
observable
from
just
outside
the
plantation
and
to
judge
from
the
sound
but
previous
movements
within
the
plantation
unless
we
assume
a
quite
human
organisation
would
not
explain
what
is
here
assumed
to
require
explanation
i
will
take
one
more
example
from
my
notes
on
before
returning
to
the
flocks
of
small
birds
at
the
stacks
a
number
of
this
was
early
on
a
very
cold
morning
have
now
settled
on
the
elms
near
me
i
am
quite
still
and
they
have
sat
there
quietly
for
some
little
time
all
at
once
the
whole
band
fly
out
to
all
appearance
at
one
and
the
same
moment
and
in
a
peculiar
way
with
sudden
sweeps
and
rushes
through
the
air
in
a
downward
direction
shooting
and
across
each
other
with
a
whizzing
whirr
of
the
wings
in
much
the
same
manner
as
do
rooks
on
account
of
this
peculiar
flight
which
seems
to
be
joyous
and
sportive
i
do
not
believe
they
have
seen
me
but
whether
they
have
or
not
the
absolutely
simultaneous
flight
of
the
whole
body
is
to
me
equally
hard
to
account
for
supposing
what
would
be
most
likely
that
only
one
bird
has
seen
me
how
has
this
knowledge
been
communicated
instantaneously
to
all
the
rest
there
was
no
note
uttered
of
any
kind
i
must
have
heard
it
i
think
if
it
had
been
so
near
as
i
was
nor
are
pigeons
supposed
to
have
an
it
may
be
said
that
the
sudden
abrupt
flight
of
one
alarmed
the
rest
but
all
can
not
have
been
looking
at
this
one
at
the
same
time
and
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
that
there
was
anything
to
discriminate
in
the
actual
sound
of
the
wings
for
one
or
more
than
one
bird
may
at
any
time
fly
eagerly
off
without
affecting
the
others
moreover
if
this
were
the
explanation
there
would
have
been
an
appreciable
interval
of
time
between
the
flight
of
the
alarmed
bird
and
the
others
which
to
my
sense
there
was
not
but
as
i
say
i
do
not
believe
that
the
birds
saw
me
and
if
not
the
collective
instantaneous
impulse
of
flight
seems
still
harder
to
account
for
on
ordinary
known
principles
it
is
of
course
easy
to
give
a
plausible
explanation
of
a
thing
and
take
for
granted
that
all
the
facts
are
in
accordance
but
the
facts
when
one
watches
them
are
apt
to
discredit
the
theory
observation
and
difficulties
begin
often
at
the
same
time
returning
now
to
the
little
winter
collections
of
chaffinches
greenfinches
bramblings
which
come
and
feed
at
the
during
the
winter
in
general
they
whirr
up
every
three
or
four
minutes
but
the
intervals
vary
and
may
be
much
longer
sometimes
only
about
half
the
flock
flies
off
the
rest
not
appearing
to
care
much
about
it
usually
a
much
greater
number
does
and
this
often
appears
to
be
the
whole
number
but
almost
always
unless
of
course
on
the
approach
of
a
man
or
some
other
such
alarming
occurrence
some
few
at
least
remain
as
with
the
starlings
these
flights
seem
often
to
be
absolutely
instantaneous
the
birds
all
rising
together
in
a
solid
block
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
and
the
cloud
may
be
preceded
by
a
little
about
of
three
or
four
individuals
whilst
sometimes
there
is
for
a
second
or
two
a
very
quick
following
of
one
another
if
this
were
always
so
and
if
one
bird
could
not
fly
off
without
others
following
it
there
would
be
little
or
nothing
to
explain
but
as
we
have
seen
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
case
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
birds
begin
to
come
back
almost
as
soon
as
they
are
gone
but
in
spite
of
this
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
cause
of
flight
was
almost
always
a
nervous
apprehension
such
as
actuates
schoolboys
when
they
are
doing
something
of
a
forbidden
nature
and
half
expect
to
see
the
master
appear
at
any
moment
round
the
corner
though
there
might
be
no
discernible
ground
for
apprehension
yet
after
some
three
or
four
minutes
it
seemed
to
strike
the
assembly
that
it
not
be
quite
safe
to
remain
any
longer
and
presto
they
were
gone
afterwards
it
was
recognised
that
there
had
been
no
real
reason
for
alarm
and
they
came
back
but
this
seemed
to
strike
them
individually
rather
than
collectively
now
it
was
by
stacks
in
the
open
fields
under
no
more
cover
as
a
rule
than
the
neighbouring
hedgerow
that
i
had
noticed
these
phenomena
and
coming
one
day
upon
such
a
heap
of
chaff
or
draff
though
without
any
stack
in
the
centre
of
a
small
plantation
of
fir
and
pine
trees
i
determined
to
watch
here
a
number
of
small
birds
having
flown
up
as
i
approached
i
was
able
to
conceal
myself
very
well
amidst
some
bushes
that
grew
quite
near
and
very
shortly
the
birds
chaffinches
bramblings
hedge
and
but
not
greenfinches
were
down
again
i
stayed
a
considerable
while
but
except
once
or
twice
when
i
moved
a
little
so
as
to
alarm
them
they
remained
feeding
all
or
most
of
the
time
sometimes
indeed
some
or
other
of
them
would
fly
into
the
surrounding
trees
or
bushes
but
this
they
did
at
their
leisure
without
alarm
or
hurry
and
only
as
desiring
a
change
the
simultaneousness
was
wanting
there
were
none
of
those
nervous
flights
at
short
intervals
that
i
had
observed
when
watching
at
the
open
here
amongst
the
pines
and
protected
on
every
side
the
birds
felt
apparently
quite
secure
though
whether
it
was
altogether
a
rational
security
may
be
questioned
this
observation
strengthened
me
in
my
conclusion
as
to
these
flights
being
caused
by
a
feeling
of
nervous
apprehension
or
alarm
but
i
am
bound
to
add
another
case
of
the
mouse
that
i
subsequently
watched
by
stacks
in
the
open
where
also
a
considerable
sense
of
security
seemed
to
prevail
temperature
may
perhaps
have
something
to
do
with
the
explanation
but
i
have
as
yet
taken
no
steps
to
test
this
theory
but
whatever
may
be
the
motive
which
of
course
may
vary
of
such
sudden
flights
and
here
i
am
thinking
of
all
the
examples
which
i
have
brought
forward
as
well
as
others
in
fact
the
whole
range
of
the
phenomena
how
are
we
to
account
for
their
simultaneousness
and
the
other
special
features
belonging
to
them
it
would
seem
as
though
either
one
and
the
same
idea
were
flashed
suddenly
into
the
minds
of
a
number
of
birds
in
close
proximity
to
each
other
at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
or
that
this
same
idea
having
originated
or
attained
a
certain
degree
of
vehemence
at
some
one
point
or
points
representing
some
individual
bird
or
birds
spread
from
thence
as
from
one
or
more
centres
with
inconceivable
rapidity
so
as
to
embrace
either
the
whole
group
or
a
portion
of
it
according
to
the
strength
of
the
original
outleap
in
other
words
i
suppose
or
at
least
i
suggest
it
that
birds
when
gathered
together
in
large
numbers
think
and
act
not
individually
but
collectively
or
rather
that
they
do
both
the
one
and
the
other
for
that
individual
birds
are
capable
of
withstanding
the
collective
influence
of
the
flock
of
which
they
form
a
part
i
have
ample
evidence
the
old
athenians
though
wherein
they
may
be
compared
to
the
americans
at
one
period
were
a
very
democratic
people
and
lived
a
more
public
life
than
any
other
civilised
community
either
before
or
after
them
of
which
we
have
any
record
they
were
also
of
a
very
emotional
temperament
and
it
is
curious
to
find
amongst
them
the
idea
at
any
rate
of
the
φημη
a
sudden
wave
or
current
of
thought
which
swept
through
an
assembly
causing
it
to
think
and
act
as
one
man
when
watching
numbers
of
birds
together
this
φημη
idea
has
constantly
been
brought
to
my
mind
nor
do
i
see
how
the
whole
of
the
facts
are
to
be
explained
except
upon
some
such
hypothesis
if
we
suppose
that
the
sudden
flurryings
away
of
a
band
of
small
birds
from
the
where
they
have
been
quietly
feeding
are
caused
by
the
apprehension
of
danger
we
may
well
credit
the
birds
with
having
sharper
senses
than
our
own
though
that
they
are
often
mistaken
is
shown
by
their
almost
immediate
return
and
also
by
as
many
of
them
sometimes
remaining
as
fly
away
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
every
individual
bird
of
a
large
number
crowded
together
and
busily
feeding
can
at
the
same
instant
of
time
see
the
same
object
or
even
hear
the
same
sound
of
alarm
unless
very
loud
or
conspicuous
nor
can
it
be
supposed
that
the
same
thought
producing
the
same
action
can
flash
independently
into
all
their
minds
at
once
by
mere
chance
but
if
we
suppose
thought
to
be
like
a
wind
sweeping
amongst
them
and
producing
each
time
that
it
rises
to
a
certain
degree
of
strength
its
appropriate
act
then
we
can
understand
fifty
seventy
or
a
hundred
birds
rising
in
this
like
leaves
or
straws
blown
up
in
a
sudden
gust
and
in
the
same
way
as
when
a
blizzard
or
tornado
bursts
on
a
town
some
frail
objects
in
a
room
through
which
it
has
torn
may
be
left
standing
whilst
everything
else
is
strewed
about
in
ruin
so
may
the
to
use
the
more
familiar
term
moving
with
inconceivable
rapidity
amidst
the
flock
miss
out
some
individuals
though
right
in
the
midst
of
those
that
are
affected
in
a
manner
which
is
hard
to
account
for
again
if
we
suppose
two
centres
from
which
two
opposite
or
impulses
spread
we
can
understand
two
groups
of
birds
which
together
have
made
one
band
acting
in
different
ways
or
going
in
different
directions
as
one
may
constantly
see
with
rooks
and
starlings
whilst
by
supposing
that
the
wave
or
energy
tends
to
exhaust
itself
after
spreading
to
a
certain
distance
around
any
point
or
centre
where
it
may
have
originated
or
become
focussed
we
account
for
such
facts
as
many
thousands
of
starlings
say
rising
from
perhaps
a
million
without
the
others
being
affected
but
no
doubt
even
in
an
athenian
assembly
there
were
some
men
capable
of
withstanding
the
force
of
the
φημη
and
if
we
give
to
birds
even
when
thus
assembled
together
a
power
of
individual
as
well
as
collective
action
varying
in
each
unit
so
that
the
one
power
is
now
more
and
now
less
under
the
control
of
the
other
but
with
on
the
whole
a
preponderance
in
favour
of
the
latter
we
then
as
it
appears
to
me
come
near
to
explaining
what
i
must
regard
as
the
often
very
puzzling
problem
of
the
movements
of
such
assembled
bodies
in
the
wilderness
of
grote
twelve
volumes
i
can
not
now
find
the
passage
which
i
seem
to
remember
so
well
nor
can
anyone
including
the
whole
of
the
psychical
research
society
help
me
to
my
greek
word
i
am
told
too
is
wrong
but
let
it
stand
till
someone
can
give
me
the
right
one
this
of
course
is
the
theory
of
and
if
this
power
does
really
exist
in
the
case
of
any
one
species
we
might
expect
it
to
exist
also
in
the
case
of
others
with
the
evidence
of
its
existence
amongst
ourselves
i
am
not
unacquainted
but
i
need
say
nothing
of
this
or
of
my
humble
opinion
concerning
it
here
i
have
suggested
it
as
a
possible
explanation
of
some
of
the
actions
of
birds
because
i
have
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
them
in
any
other
way
if
it
could
be
made
out
that
animals
did
really
in
some
degree
possess
this
power
it
might
throw
a
new
light
upon
many
things
and
possibly
explain
some
difficulties
of
a
larger
kind
than
those
which
i
have
called
it
in
to
do
to
me
at
least
it
has
always
seemed
a
little
curious
that
language
of
a
more
perfect
kind
than
animals
use
has
been
so
late
in
developing
itself
but
animals
would
feel
less
the
want
of
a
language
if
existed
amongst
them
to
any
appreciable
extent
assuming
its
existence
it
is
amongst
gregarious
animals
that
we
might
expect
to
find
it
most
developed
and
gregariousness
has
probably
preceded
any
great
mental
advance
therefore
before
an
animal
reached
a
grade
of
intelligence
such
as
might
render
the
growth
of
a
language
possible
it
would
have
become
gregarious
and
assuming
it
then
to
have
a
certain
power
of
feeling
and
being
influenced
by
the
thought
of
its
fellows
without
the
aid
of
sound
or
gesture
it
is
obvious
that
here
would
be
a
power
tending
to
dull
and
weaken
that
struggle
to
express
thought
by
sound
which
may
be
supposed
to
have
slowly
and
unconsciously
led
to
the
formation
of
a
language
here
then
would
be
a
retarding
influence
still
as
ideas
communicated
in
this
way
would
probably
be
of
a
general
and
simple
kind
corresponding
perhaps
more
to
emotions
and
sensations
than
definite
ideas
the
need
for
more
precise
impartment
would
gradually
as
mental
power
became
more
and
more
developed
become
more
and
more
felt
then
would
come
language
as
spoken
and
spoken
language
once
established
would
tend
to
weaken
the
old
primitive
power
as
an
improvement
on
which
it
had
arisen
thus
if
exist
in
man
it
may
perhaps
represent
a
reversion
to
a
more
primitive
and
generalised
means
of
mental
intercommunion
or
the
older
power
may
exist
and
still
occasionally
act
or
even
do
so
habitually
to
some
extent
in
fact
it
may
not
yet
have
entirely
died
out
possibly
also
it
might
tend
to
survive
and
even
to
some
extent
increase
as
being
in
certain
ways
and
directions
superior
to
the
more
precise
medium
but
if
so
it
would
become
unless
specially
cultivated
more
and
more
limited
to
these
directions
certain
it
is
that
people
seem
often
to
approach
each
other
mentally
much
more
by
feeling
than
by
words
and
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
we
call
this
insight
intuitive
perception
affinity
but
such
words
do
not
explain
the
process
is
it
not
possible
that
birds
living
habitually
together
as
part
of
a
crowd
may
have
acquired
the
faculty
of
thinking
and
acting
all
together
or
in
masses
each
one
mind
being
a
part
of
the
general
mind
of
the
whole
band
but
each
possessing
also
its
individual
mind
and
will
by
virtue
of
which
it
is
enabled
to
suspend
its
general
and
act
individually
perhaps
a
careful
observation
of
gregarious
animals
in
a
wild
state
or
even
if
a
more
special
definition
be
wanted
of
large
crowds
or
masses
of
men
might
throw
some
light
upon
this
subject
and
it
would
at
any
rate
be
approaching
it
upon
a
broader
basis
and
by
methods
less
tainted
with
our
silly
prejudices
than
has
hitherto
been
done
but
when
i
speak
of
gregarious
animals
in
a
wild
state
i
am
forgetting
that
such
hardly
any
longer
exist
the
great
herds
of
bisons
zebras
antelopes
giraffes
that
once
roamed
over
places
now
given
over
to
humanity
and
inhumanity
have
disappeared
and
what
have
we
learnt
from
them
who
has
watched
them
at
least
very
carefully
or
patiently
with
thoughts
other
than
of
their
slaughter
i
know
of
no
careful
record
of
their
movements
taken
from
hour
to
hour
and
from
day
to
day
a
few
generalities
conveying
some
of
the
more
obvious
and
striking
facts
or
what
seemed
to
be
so
will
alone
survive
their
extinction
enlightened
curiosity
has
been
drowned
in
bloodthirstiness
and
the
coarse
pleasure
of
killing
has
in
us
the
higher
ones
of
observation
and
inference
we
have
studied
animals
only
to
kill
them

killed
them
in

to
study
them
our

chapter
ix
watching
birds
in
the
greenwoods
i
have
called
attention
in
the
last
chapter
to
that
independent
or
quality
which
so
many
birds
possess
and
by
virtue
of
which
they
often
act
differently
to
their
fellows
even
when
there
is
a
strong
inducement
to
them
to
act
as
they
do
this
seems
to
me
an
important
point
for
it
must
be
as
the
upon
which
change
of
habit
would
be
built
and
change
of
habit
points
out
a
certain
path
along
which
change
of
structure
were
it
to
occur
would
be
preserved
and
a
new
species
be
thus
formed
one
might
think
that
the
most
timid
birds
would
under
ordinary
circumstances
be
the
ones
least
liable
to
change
their
habits
for
such
change
would
often
mean
a
penetrating
into
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
where
they
might
be
expected
to
fear
and
distrust
in
a
higher
degree
than
amidst
surroundings
with
which
they
were
familiar
this
perhaps
may
be
the
case
but
one
must
distinguish
between
timidity
and
a
wary
caution
or
prudence
which
may
be
combined
with
an
independent
perhaps
one
may
even
say
a
bold
spirit
the
is
an
example
of
such
a
combination
i
have
watched
these
birds
for
hours
browsing
over
some
bordering
a
small
and
very
quiet
stream
near
where
i
live
sometimes
there
would
be
a
dozen
or
twenty
scattered
over
a
wide
space
and
every
now
and
again
when
something
had
alarmed
them
the
whole
troop
one
taking
the
cue
from
another
would
run
or
fly
to
the
water
most
of
them
swimming
across
and
taking
refuge
in
a
belt
of
reeds
skirting
the
opposite
bank
whilst
some
few
would
remain
floating
in
ready
to
follow
their
companions
if
necessary
in
two
or
three
minutes
or
sometimes
less
they
would
all
be
back
browsing
again
and
so
continue
till
all
at
once
there
was
another
panic
rush
and
flight
the
cause
of
these
stampedes
was
generally
undiscoverable
but
sometimes
when
the
birds
stayed
some
time
down
on
the
water
the
figure
of
a
rustic
would
at
length
appear
walking
behind
a
hedge
along
a
path
bounding
the
little
meadow
of
such
a
figure
rooks
and
many
other
birds
would
have
taken
no
notice
even
when
considerably
nearer
one
cause
of
alarm
i
frequently
noted
and
this
was
where
another
would
come
flying
over
the
meadow
either
to
alight
amongst
those
upon
it
or
making
for
a
more
distant
point
of
the
stream
such
birds
though
not
alarmed
themselves
for
i
frequently
saw
the
commencement
and
spontaneous
nature
of
their
flights
yet
always
brought
alarm
to
the
others
a
fact
which
seems
to
me
interesting
for
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
these
would
have
been
disquieted
at
the
mere
sight
of
one
of
their
kind
and
if
they
judged
from
the
flying
bird
manner
that
it
was
seeking
safety
then
they
judged
wrongly
this
again
does
not
seem
likely
and
the
only
remaining
explanation
is
that
they
drew
an
inference
this
bird
be
flying
from
danger
which
i
think
must
have
been
the
case
at
any
rate
each
time
it
was
a
one
of
themselves
sent
them
all
in
a
race
to
the
water
just
as
a
dog
or
a
man
would
have
done
but
i
must
qualify
the
word
all
often
perhaps
each
time
one
or
two
birds
might
be
seen
like
the
pheasant
to
glance
warily
about
as
though
to
assure
themselves
whether
there
was
danger
or
not
standing
the
while
in
a
hesitating
attitude
and
ready
on
the
slightest
indication
to
follow
their
companions
then
having
satisfied
themselves
they
would
continue
quietly
to
browse
for
browse
the
grass
of
meadows
as
do
geese
coming
now
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bird
character
its
boldness
and
enterprise
i
remember
one
afternoon
when
i
had
been
watching
the
stone
curlews
seeing
just
as
evening
was
falling
a
walking
along
the
piece
of
wire
netting
which
skirted
a
or
rather
an
arid
waste
of
sand
where
some
wheat
was
feebly
attempting
to
grow
the
whole
country
around
was
the
chosen
haunt
of
the
former
birds
as
opposed
therefore
to
anything
damp
moist
or
marshy
as
can
well
be
imagined
the
went
steadily
on
with
a
composed
and
step
never
deviating
from
the
straight
line
of
the
netting
till
upon
coming
to
where
this
was
continued
at
a
right
angle
in
another
direction
it
found
its
way
through
and
proceeded
to
cross
a
green
road
skirted
with
into
another
waste
where
i
lost
it
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
nearest
little
pond
or
pool
possibly
it
was
walking
from
one
of
these
to
another
but
quite
as
probably
in
my
experience
it
was
leaving
its
ordinary
haunts
for
some
inland
part
it
had
discovered
where
it
could
get
food
to
its
liking
for
the
living
in
the
little
creek
or
stream
that
i
used
to
watch
would
range
over
the
adjacent
and
a
few
of
them
having
come
to
the
limit
of
this
would
climb
up
a
steep
bank
and
through
a
hedge
at
its
top
down
again
into
a
little
bush
and
patch
on
the
other
side
one
bird
indeed
that
i
startled
actually
climbed
this
bank
and
scrambled
through
the
hedge
into
the
patch
instead
of
flying
to
the
water
which
is
as
though
a
lady
were
to
take
up
shakespeare
rather
than
a
novel
or
a
to
act
by
reason
instead
of
by
rote
again
i
have
startled
a
out
of
a
large
tree
standing
in
a
thicket
and
a
good
way
back
from
the
ditch
surrounding
it
such
a
tree
as
one
might
have
expected
to
see
a
fly
out
of
but
certainly
not
a
such
variations
of
habit
are
to
me
more
interesting
than
those
of
structure
for
they
represent
the
mind
as
do
the
latter
which
they
have
probably
in
most
cases
preceded
the
body
changes
of
structure
too
if
slight
are
not
easy
to
see
and
as
soon
as
they
become
observable
the
varying
animal
is
dubbed
another
species
or
at
least
a
variety
of
the
old
one
so
that
one
is
not
allowed
as
it
were
to
see
the
actual
passage
from
form
to
form
one
is
always
either
at
one
end
of
the
bridge
or
the
other
end
but
changed
habits
may
be
marked
and
there
is
hardly
perhaps
a
bird
or
a
beast
which
if
closely
watched
will
not
be
seen
to
act
sometimes
in
a
manner
which
if
persisted
in
to
the
neglect
of
its
more
usual
circle
of
activities
would
make
it
in
effect
a
new
being
though
dressed
in
an
old
suit
of
clothes
thus
in
such
a
bird
as
the
robin
which
is
associated
and
rightly
in
the
popular
mind
with
the
cottage
the
little
rustic
garden
and
with
woodlands
wild
such
scenes
and
surroundings
in
fact
as
are
represented
or
used
to
be
on
christmas
cards
one
may
get
a
hint
of
some
future
little
bird
at
first
no
more
aquatic
than
the
but
becoming
perhaps
as
time
goes
on
as
accomplished
a
diver
and
clinger
to
stones
at
the
bottom
of
running
streams
as
is
the
a
bird
as
to
which
darwin
says
the
acutest
observer
by
examining
its
dead
body
would
never
have
suspected
its
habits
to
illustrate
this
i
take
from
my
notes
the
following
a
robin
it
is
in
december
flies
on
to
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
spanning
the
little
stream
from
thence
on
to
some
weedy
scum
lying
against
it
on
the
water
from
which
he
picks
something
off
and
returns
again
to
the
trunk
two
or
three
times
again
he
flies
down
and
hops
about
on
the
weeds
and
sometimes
whilst
doing
so
pecks
at
the
great
black
trunk
now
he
is
standing
on
them
contentedly
with
the
water
touching
his
crimson
he
is
in
his
first
or
more
primitive
figure
for
the
robin
has
two
either
he
is
a
little
round
globe
with
a
sunset
in
him
his
rotundity
being
broken
only
by
a
beak
and
a
tail
or
else
very
elegant
dapper
and
well
set
up
in
the
first
he
is
fluffy
for
he
has
ruffled
out
his
feathers
but
in
the
last
he
has
pressed
them
down
and
is
smooth
and
glossy
has
almost
a
polish
on
him
again
whilst
walking
by
the
river
in
the
early
morning
the
water
being
very
low
a
robin
hops
down
over
the
exposed
shingle
to
near
the
edge
then
flies
across
to
the
opposite
more
muddy
surface
and
hops
along
it
pecking
here
and
there
he
again
flies
across
and
proceeds
in
the
same
way
always
going
up
the
stream
crosses
again
and
so
on
each
time
he
is
farther
away
from
me
and
now
i
lose
sight
of
him
but
this
is
evidently
his
system
how
out
of
character
he
seems
amidst
the
mud
and
ooze
of
the
dank
on
this
chill
winter
morning
how
little
like
the
robin
of
poetry
and
how
much
more
in
the
style
of
some
little
bird
for
this
is
often
their
manner
of
from
shore
to
shore
up
or
down
the
stream
i
have
noticed
it
but
now
in
the
redshank
yet
the
old
associations
are
with
him
for
this
is
home
and
the
thatched
cottage
peeps
over
the
familiar
hedge
and
here
i
will
chronicle
an
experience
my
own
if
it
be
not
that
of
others
provided
there
be
shrubbery
about
there
are
but
few
places
here
in
england
where
one
can
sit
quietly
for
very
long
without
a
robin
stealing
softly
out
and
as
it
were
sliding
himself
into
the
landscape
then
however
bleak
or
chill
it
may
be
his
presence
seems
to
bring
home
comforts
with
it
but
this
is
only
when
one
is
near
home
and
home
comforts
not
when
one
is
far
far
away
from
them
i
remember
in
the
great
of
norway
so
lovely
yet
so
stern
in
their
loveliness
the
robin
seemed
to
have
lost
all
his
character
he
did
not
suggest
home
and
all
its
pleasures
when
home
was
no
longer
near
it
was
not
or
perhaps
it
was
that
by
suggestion
he
made
these
seem
farther
off
but
that
his
character
seemed
gone
surely
things
are
to
us
as
a
part
of
what
they
move
in
with
us
and
out
of
this
seem
changed
and
to
be
something
else
i
am
not
quite
sure
if
the
following
represents
any
change
of
habits
in
regard
to
food
induced
by
the
presence
of
a
foreign
tree
in
any
of
the
three
birds
that
it
concerns
i
have
occasionally
watched
the
in
our
own
but
have
not
yet
seen
him
attacking
the
cones
though
the
as
i
believe
does
so
for
the
greenfinch
i
can
only
say
that
i
should
not
have
thought
it
of
him
nor
is
he
often
to
be
seen
in
such
places
the
is
not
common
where
i
live
standing
this
christmas
eve
under
a
large
exotic
conifer
on
the
lawn
of
the
garden
here
in
gloucestershire
i
became
aware
that
various
birds
were
busy
amongst
its
branches
and
i
kept
hearing
a
curious
grating
noise
with
a
strong
vibration
in
it
which
seemed
to
be
made
by
them
with
the
beak
upon
the
large
but
as
the
branches
were
very
close
together
and
the
birds
high
up
i
could
not
observe
the
manner
of
it
the
sound
as
i
said
before
being
very
peculiar
i
therefore
climbed
the
tree
which
was
easy
and
the
birds
being
now
often
quite
near
though
the
branches
and
great
clusters
of
were
much
in
the
way
i
ascertained
that
it
was
the
greenfinch
alone
which
was
producing
the
peculiar
vibratory
noise
but
how
exactly
he
did
it
i
could
not
make
out
he
appeared
to
be
tearing
at
the
woody
sheaths
or
clubs
which
stood
wide
apart
of
the
large
and
it
seemed
as
though
to
give
the
vibration
in
the
sound
either
the
mandibles
must
work
against
each
other
with
extraordinary
swiftness
or
the
clubs
of
the
cone
itself
vibrate
in
some
manner
against
the
beak
thus
causing
the
sound
in
question
to
mingle
with
the
scratching
made
by
the
latter
against
the
hard
surface
the
and
the
are
also
busy
at
the
cones
the
former
strikes
them
repeatedly
with
his
bill
making
a
quick
he
attacks
them
either
from
the
branch
or
twigs
from
which
they
hang
striking
downwards
or
clinging
to
the
side
of
one
and
striking
or
even
hanging
at
their
tips
in
which
case
he
hammers
up
at
them
whilst
hammering
or
rather
he
often
bends
his
head
very
sharply
from
the
body
almost
at
a
right
angle
towards
the
point
at
which
his
blow
is
aimed
and
he
then
becomes
as
it
were
a
natural
live
pickaxe
of
which
his
body
is
the
handle
and
his
head
and
beak
the
pick
after
hammering
a
little
on
one
of
two
cones
that
hang
together
he
perches
on
the
other
one
and
in
the
intervals
of
hammering
it
shifts
his
head
to
the
first
and
gives
it
as
it
seems
a
sharp
investigatory
glance
he
then
flies
away
a
also
i
twice
see
hammering
at
the
cones
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
tit
and
having
loosened
a
thin
brown
flake
from
one
of
them
he
flies
off
with
it
in
his
beak
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
tit
do
this
nor
did
i
ever
see
him
get
an
insect
if
he
got
anything
at
all
it
must
have
been
in
one
of
the
actual
blows
become
a
peck
as
when
he
hammers
at
a
hung
in
the
garden
the
greenfinches
never
hammered
but
only
bit
and
tugged
at
the
clubs
of
the
cones
brown
flakes
often
fell
down
from
them
but
i
never
saw
the
birds
fly
off
with
these
as
the
has
done
i
had
seen
one
with
a
flake
in
his
bill
which
however
he
soon
let
fall
to
the
ground
one
of
the
greenfinches
is
again
attacking
the
cones
and
i
can
now
see
the
way
he
does
it
more
plainly
he
places
his
beak
between
the
clubs
of
the
cones
at
their
tips
i
mean
their
outer
ends
and
then
moves
his
head
and
beak
rapidly
seeming
as
it
were
to
flutter
with
his
head
and
as
he
does
this
you
hear
the
grating
vibratory
sound
all
the
time
he
is
clinging
head
downwards
to
the
side
of
the
cone
quite
a
feat
for
so
large
at
least
for
such
a
bird
i
will
not
however
be
quite
sure
that
it
is
to
the
cone
itself
that
he
clings
the
hang
in
bunches
near
them
and
his
claws
may
be
fixed
amongst
these
though
i
do
not
think
so
or
at
least
not
always
besides
this
sound
made
with
the
beak
on
the
there
is
another
which
one
often
hears
and
which
is
usually
i
think
made
by
the
greenfinch
to
get
at
the
cones
he
often
flies
up
underneath
them
and
hangs
a
little
thus
before
clinging
on
fluttering
wings
when
the
tips
of
these
strike
amongst
the
bunches
of
needles
a
sharp
thin
vibratory
rattle
is
produced
also
a
very
noticeable
sound
the
or
another
one
now
flies
in
again
uttering
as
he
arrives
a
curious
high
sharp
note
zitch
zitch
and
again
flies
away
with
a
thin
brown
flake
in
his
bill
a
very
woody
morsel
it
would
seem
and
now
later
in
the
afternoon
i
see
a
probing
the
cones
with
his
bill
and
he
also
pulls
out
a
brown
flake
and
flies
away
with
it
another
does
the
same
hanging
from
the
tip
of
a
cone
on
which
he
afterwards
perches
for
a
moment
before
flying
with
it
to
another
tree
whilst
standing
all
this
time
in
the
tree
i
had
noticed
little
hard
brown
seeds
about
the
size
of
and
which
had
all
been
cracked
lying
in
the
forks
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
branches
with
the
trunk
there
was
hardly
one
such
in
which
there
were
not
a
few
of
these
cracked
seeds
pulling
off
a
i
began
to
pull
it
to
pieces
and
at
once
saw
at
the
base
of
every
club
where
it
had
joined
and
helped
to
form
the
central
pillar
the
double
indentation
one
on
either
side
of
the
median
line
or
as
it
would
be
called
in
a
true
leaf
in
which
the
two
seeds
had
been
lying
soon
i
came
upon
a
seed
itself
and
attached
to
the
outer
end
of
it
that
farthest
from
the
base
of
the
club
i
at
once
recognised
the
little
brown
flaky
leaf
that
i
had
seen
in
the
bills
of
all
three
birds
but
which
none
of
them
seemed
to
eat
here
then
the
whole
mystery
for
to
my
ignorance
it
had
been
such
was
explained
the
birds
were
picking
out
the
seeds
from
the
cone
and
the
way
to
do
this
was
to
seize
the
thin
brown
flake
to
which
the
seed
was
attached
and
which
lay
all
along
inside
each
club
or
leaf
of
the
cone
whereas
the
seed
itself
was
right
at
the
base
and
the
beak
of
the
birds
could
not
perhaps
or
not
so
easily
be
pushed
up
so
far
between
the
stiff
clubs
the
hard
edges
of
which
would
catch
their
foreheads
uncomfortably
at
least
with
the
tit
and
greenfinch
whose
bills
are
not
long
this
would
seem
to
be
likely
when
the
birds
as
was
evidently
often
the
case
pulled
out
only
the
thin
which
had
become
detached
from
the
seed
they
let
it
fall
negligently
thus
conveying
the
impression
that
they
had
been
taking
trouble
to
no
end
when
however
they
flew
away
with
it
it
is
to
be
presumed
the
seed
was
attached
here
then
are
three
quite
different
birds
all
busily
occupied
in
extracting
the
seeds
from
the
large
cones
of
an
exotic
species
of
fir
but
whilst
two
of
them
the
and
the
effect
this
by
first
hammering
on
the
cone
so
as
to
loosen
the
seeds
or
rather
the
woody
flake
to
which
they
are
attached
from
the
basal
part
of
the
club
if
we
may
assume
this
to
be
the
object
before
pulling
them
out
the
greenfinch
procures
them
without
any
previous
hammering
which
is
an
action
perhaps
to
which
it
is
not
accustomed
one
should
not
however
assume
too
hastily
that
the
latter
bird
has
no
plan
of
his
own
for
first
loosening
the
seeds
remembering
the
rapid
almost
fluttering
motion
not
at
all
like
pecking
or
hammering
which
he
communicates
to
his
head
and
bill
with
the
curious
vibratory
sound
which
again
does
not
suggest
an
ordinary
blow
that
accompanies
it
and
how
often
when
i
could
get
a
fairly
good
view
of
him
he
seemed
to
be
repeatedly
seizing
and
letting
his
bill
slip
over
the
outer
edges
of
the
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
making
the
stiff
clubs
vibrate
on
their
stalks
their
hinges
so
to
speak
in
a
manner
that
would
tend
to
loosen
the
seeds
as
effectually
perhaps
as
would
tapping
them
judging
by
these
limited
observations
i
should
say
that
the
was
the
most
skilful
of
the
three
in
extracting
the
seeds
as
on
the
two
occasions
when
i
saw
him
plainly
he
flew
away
with
a
flake
soon
once
almost
immediately
after
he
had
come
he
looked
more
like
a
connoisseur
too
and
his
bill
is
much
longer
he
alone
as
i
should
think
might
possibly
be
able
to
drive
it
right
down
so
as
to
seize
the
actual
seed
yet
he
tapped
the
cone
in
the
same
quick
manner
as
did
the
tit
nor
did
he
appear
to
me
to
be
probing
it
at
such
times
moreover
i
never
observed
him
any
more
than
the
others
to
extract
the
seed
independently
of
the
flake
birds
that
are
not
will
often
behave
very
much
as
if
they
were
so
and
show
different
degrees
of
expertness
in
the
art
it
seems
quite
natural
that
a
small
bird
which
habitually
frequents
trees
should
sometimes
cling
to
the
trunk
but
what
surprises
me
is
that
with
so
much
raw
material
to
have
worked
upon
nature
should
not
have
developed
some
of
our
small
perching
birds
into
actual
my
observations
on
the
and
the
wren
show
at
least
that
should
anything
occur
to
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
procure
food
in
other
ways
or
should
they
and
this
is
easier
to
imagine
develop
a
partiality
for
some
particular
kind
of
insect
or
other
creatures
living
in
the
chinks
or
under
the
bark
of
trees
say
spiders
for
instance
which
are
often
to
be
found
there
in
colonies
they
would
be
all
ready
to
become
specialised
experts
at
least
it
appears
to
me
so
and
i
think
it
the
more
curious
because
they
do
not
seem
often
to
practise
what
they
can
do
so
well
here
is
my
note
taken
in
october
when
perhaps
there
would
be
a
little
more
scarcity
of
the
ordinary
food
of
such
birds
than
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
year
in
a
grove
of
scotch
firs
this
morning
i
noted
first
a
clinging
to
the
trunk
of
one
in
the
same
manner
as
a
or
hardly
had
he
flown
off
it
when
a
wren
flew
to
and
commenced
to
ascend
perpendicularly
the
trunk
of
a
tree
quite
near
me
flying
thence
to
another
which
it
also
ascended
and
so
on
from
tree
to
tree
afterwards
however
i
was
able
to
watch
acting
in
this
manner
for
some
little
time
as
well
as
quite
closely
and
i
decided
that
they
were
the
greater
adepts
of
the
two
they
climbed
the
perpendicular
or
overhanging
trunk
with
ease
and
swiftness
clinging
to
the
roughnesses
of
the
bark
at
which
they
pecked
from
time
to
time
i
imagine
for
insects
usually
they
went
straight
upwards
but
sometimes
more
or
less
slantingly
i
also
noted
and
this
i
had
not
been
able
to
do
for
certain
in
the
wren
that
they
descended
as
well
as
ascended
the
trunks
of
the
trees
but
here
the
manner
of
progressing
was
not
quite
so
scansorial
for
it
was
with
a
little
flutter
whether
they
used
the
feet
as
well
as
the
wings
in
the
descent
i
could
not
actually
see
but
they
kept
quite
near
enough
to
the
trunk
to
have
done
so
these
little
fluttering
drops
or
interested
me
very
much
the
bird
never
made
them
except
whilst
hanging
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
perpendicularly
and
head
downwards
and
when
he
stopped
and
clung
to
it
again
he
was
in
precisely
the
same
position
the
drop
each
time
might
have
been
from
four
to
six
or
seven
inches
it
never
appeared
to
me
to
be
more
both
the
therefore
and
the
wren
have
acquired
the
habit
of
creeping
about
the
trunks
of
trees
in
search
presumably
of
insects
or
spiders
as
do
the
and
the
former
of
them
can
descend
the
trunk
but
not
it
would
appear
without
the
aid
of
its
wings
either
wholly
or
in
part
for
the
wren
i
saw
him
descend
once
as
i
think
in
a
quick
but
some
nettles
intervened
and
i
can
not
be
sure
on
the
next
morning
i
am
at
the
same
grove
and
about
seven
a
good
many
fly
into
it
one
of
which
is
soon
busily
occupied
on
the
trunk
of
a
i
now
observe
that
this
bird
uses
his
wings
even
in
ascending
the
trunk
for
though
he
certainly
crawls
up
it
yet
he
accompanies
each
fresh
advance
after
a
pause
with
a
little
flutter
and
advance
and
flutter
end
commonly
together
taking
him
but
a
very
little
way
a
on
the
same
tree
who
moves
deftly
about
pressed
much
flatter
to
the
trunk
and
never
using
his
wings
gives
a
good
opportunity
of
comparing
the
two
birds
the
professional
and
the
amateur
now
both
according
to
my
memory
and
my
notes
the
tits
i
saw
yesterday
did
not
flutter
at
all
while
ascending
the
tree
at
any
rate
that
one
which
i
saw
quite
close
both
ascending
and
descending
on
which
my
note
was
principally
based
did
not
for
though
i
saw
others
this
one
gave
me
the
best
and
longest
view
and
the
only
one
of
the
descent
had
he
fluttered
in
the
ascent
also
i
must
certainly
have
noted
it
and
i
should
not
then
have
placed
the
two
in
such
contradistinction
if
an
inference
may
be
drawn
from
such
limited
observation
it
perhaps
is
that
this
bird
is
in
process
of
acquiring
or
at
any
rate
of
perfecting
a
habit
and
that
therefore
all
the
individuals
do
not
excel
in
it
to
an
equal
degree
the
fact
that
i
often
watched
and
waited
to
see
them
practising
the
art
again
but
without
success
may
lend
some
colour
to
this
there
was
clinging
sometimes
but
not
climbing
in
this
competition
therefore
between
the
wren
and
the
tit
as
the
tit
bears
off
the
bell
but
later
i
had
a
better
opportunity
of
observing
the
prowess
of
the
latter
bird
and
though
i
did
not
see
it
descend
yet
in
ease
and
deftness
length
of
time
during
which
the
part
was
assumed
and
general
fidelity
of
the
understudy
to
the
original
it
must
i
think
be
pronounced
the
superior
it
was
early
on
a
cold
rainy
cheerless
morning
towards
the
end
of
february
that
i
was
so
lucky
as
not
to
be
in
bed
i
say
have
this
morning
watched
closely
and
from
quite
near
a
wren
behaving
just
like
a
professional
it
ascended
the
trunk
of
an
alder
quickly
and
easily
and
sometimes
to
a
considerable
height
twenty
or
thirty
feet
perhaps
beginning
from
the
roots
and
then
flew
down
to
the
roots
or
base
of
the
next
one
and
so
on
along
a
whole
line
of
them
up
the
sloping
roots
or
anywhere
at
all
horizontal
it
hopped
along
in
the
usual
manner
but
when
the
trunk
became
perpendicular
it
crept
or
crawled
just
like
a
true
i
was
as
i
say
quite
close
and
watched
it
most
attentively
it
certainly
as
far
as
good
looking
can
settle
it
did
not
assist
itself
with
the
wings
they
remained
close
against
the
sides
or
if
they
moved
at
all
it
was
imperceptible
to
my
eyes
which
by
the
way
are
nevertheless
at
a
later
period
for
i
followed
along
the
trees
when
i
watched
it
at
only
a
few
paces
off
it
as
certainly
appeared
that
it
did
use
the
wings
advancing
up
the
trunk
by
flutterings
but
these
were
so
small
and
slight
and
raised
the
bird
so
imperceptibly
from
the
surface
of
the
trunk
that
it
had
all
the
while
the
appearance
of
creeping
as
i
was
still
closer
to
the
bird
during
the
latter
part
of
my
watching
it
may
be
thought
that
this
alone
represents
the
actual
fact
but
for
my
part
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
my
eyesight
served
me
upon
each
occasion
if
so
then
here
is
more
from
a
darwinian
point
of
view
the
tits
it
will
be
remembered
differed
individually
but
in
this
wren
there
was
a
variation
he
could
creep
in
ascending
without
using
his
wings
and
generally
did
so
still
he
sometimes
broke
into
a
little
flutter
which
in
a
more
pronounced
form
had
been
prevalent
in
his
youth
his
father
always
did
it
in
this
way
and
there
were
very
old
wrens
still
living
who
only
up
a
trunk
but
this
was
thought
very
i
allude
to
the
motion
the
itself
i
believe
really
hops
it
will
not
be
forgotten
how
this
bird
flew
from
the
point
which
it
had
reached
on
one
tree
right
down
to
the
roots
of
another
and
ascended
from
these
the
when
it
flits
from
tree
to
tree
generally
does
so
in
a
downward
direction
if
trees
were
of
a
uniform
height
and
if
the
bird
usually
ascended
to
the
top
or
nearly
to
the
top
of
each
one
in
succession
one
could
see
the
or
even
the
necessity
of
this
practice
for
the
does
not
at
least
not
usually
descend
the
trunk
but
in
a
wood
the
top
of
one
tree
may
not
represent
half
the
height
of
another
and
moreover
a
tree
will
often
be
abandoned
by
the
bird
when
it
has
reached
only
a
moderate
height
or
is
still
quite
near
to
the
ground
and
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
how
under
these
circumstances
the
habit
should
have
arisen
but
now
if
the
forerunners
of
the
had
been
birds
accustomed
to
hop
about
on
the
ground
and
to
peer
and
pry
amongst
the
projecting
roots
of
trees
and
if
they
had
from
these
gradually
ascended
the
trunk
getting
back
to
them
at
first
quite
soon
but
making
longer
and
longer
and
more
and
more
accustomed
excursions
then
we
can
understand
how
this
habit
might
have
become
as
one
may
say
rooted
so
as
to
continue
after
there
was
no
longer
any
particular
advantage
in
it
now
however
it
is
beginning
to
weaken
i
have
on
several
occasions
which
i
duly
noted
down
at
the
time
seen
a
fly
from
one
tree
to
another
upon
which
it
clung
in
an
upward
direction
i
have
little
doubt
that
what
is
now
still
a
habit
will
come
to
be
a
preference
merely
and
that
in
time
even
this
will
cease
to
be
discernible
and
the
bird
be
guided
simply
by
circumstances
it
is
said
that
the
never
descends
the
tree
it
is
on
and
also
that
it
generally
proceeds
in
a
spiral
direction
by
which
i
suppose
is
meant
that
the
line
of
its
course
winds
round
and
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
this
last
however
has
not
been
quite
my
experience
i
have
watched
the
bird
often
and
carefully
and
i
should
say
that
a
true
spiral
ascent
by
it
is
decidedly
exceptional
often
one
has
alighted
upon
the
tall
stem
of
a
scotch
fir
on
the
side
away
from
me
and
never
come
round
into
view
at
all
on
other
occasions
after
some
time
i
have
seen
its
tiny
form
outlined
against
the
sky
on
one
or
other
side
of
the
trunk
considerably
higher
up
and
then
again
it
has
disappeared
back
or
flown
to
another
tree
this
can
hardly
be
called
a
spiral
ascent
and
i
have
seen
no
nearer
approach
to
one
often
too
i
have
seen
it
mount
quite
perpendicularly
for
a
considerable
distance
to
me
it
appears
that
the
recollects
occasionally
that
he
to
ascend
a
tree
spirally
and
begins
to
do
so
but
the
next
moment
he
forgets
this
tradition
in
his
family
and
creeps
individually
one
might
expect
indeed
that
insects
or
likely
chinks
for
them
would
act
as
so
many
deflections
from
the
path
of
spiral
progress
which
as
it
seems
likely
may
have
been
originally
adopted
for
the
same
reason
and
upon
the
same
principle
that
a
road
is
made
to
wind
round
a
mountain
instead
of
being
carried
up
the
face
of
it
but
how
is
it
then
that
the
wren
and
the
ascend
perpendicularly
for
one
would
have
thought
that
the
less
a
bird
was
the
more
would
the
advantages
of
an
easy
gradient
have
forced
themselves
upon
it
but
these
birds
are
still
sometimes
at
any
rate
aided
by
their
wings
so
that
it
would
seem
as
though
their
had
been
developed
or
was
being
developed
as
an
adjunct
to
now
as
it
appears
to
me
though
it
might
be
easier
for
a
bird
to
creep
up
a
tree
by
going
round
it
it
could
more
easily
flutter
up
it
perpendicularly
in
the
way
i
have
described
and
if
so
we
can
understand
a
bird
that
is
only
in
process
of
becoming
a
commencing
as
it
were
at
the
most
advanced
end
for
it
would
first
have
fluttered
up
perpendicularly
then
have
both
crept
and
fluttered
so
and
finally
when
it
could
creep
without
fluttering
it
would
do
so
at
first
on
the
old
fluttering
lines
then
it
might
begin
to
adopt
the
spiral
method
but
as
the
effort
required
became
less
and
less
and
structural
modification
as
seen
for
example
in
the
shape
and
stiffness
of
the
of
the
came
to
its
assistance
this
would
cease
to
be
a
help
and
become
a
habit
merely
and
when
once
a
habit
has
lost
its
it
is
in
the
way
of
being
broken
even
in
good
society
thus
the
perpendicular
ascents
of
the
may
be
the
final
stage
in
a
long
process
and
the
return
in
ease
to
what
was
before
done
in
toil
or
rather
no
particular
difficulty
would
be
experienced
so
that
the
shortest
course
would
be
the
best
one
the
is
assisted
in
its
climbing
by
the
stiff
pointed
feathers
of
the
tail
which
act
as
a
prop
and
also
by
its
small
size
which
may
possibly
have
been
partly
gained
by
natural
selection
the
great
green
woodpecker
is
possessed
of
the
first
of
these
advantages
but
not
of
the
second
and
it
is
i
believe
the
case
that
he
much
more
adheres
to
the
spiral
mode
of
ascent
than
does
the
who
as
it
seems
to
me
has
almost
discarded
it
it
would
be
interesting
therefore
to
observe
if
the
smaller
spotted
woodpecker
shows
a
greater
tendency
to
deviate
in
this
direction
but
i
have
had
no
opportunity
of
doing
this
with
regard
to
the
other
assertion
namely
that
the
never
descends
the
trunk
of
the
tree
this
is
at
least
not
true
without
qualification
for
i
have
seen
it
do
so
backwards
with
a
curious
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
quite
special
motion
it
was
quick
and
sudden
carrying
the
bird
an
inch
or
so
down
the
trunk
when
it
ceased
and
was
not
repeated
a
jerk
in
fact
but
of
a
much
more
pronounced
character
made
thus
backwards
than
any
of
the
little
forward
jerks
in
a
toned
one
might
almost
sometimes
say
a
gliding
succession
of
which
the
ordinary
creeping
consists
the
first
time
i
saw
this
action
to
dwell
upon
it
constituted
a
perpendicular
descent
but
my
eye
was
not
full
on
the
bird
at
the
moment
so
that
i
only
observed
it
imperfectly
on
the
second
occasion
i
saw
it
quite
plainly
and
this
time
the
bird
jerked
itself
sideways
as
well
as
downwards
stopping
in
the
same
abrupt
manner
though
whether
it
made
two
short
quick
jerks
or
only
one
i
could
not
be
quite
sure
of
i
think
it
was
two
but
that
only
the
last
one
gave
the
jerky
effect
it
would
thus
seem
that
the
might
really
progress
in
this
way
for
some
little
while
if
it
wished
to
the
tail
must
almost
of
necessity
be
raised
or
the
stiff
pointed
feathers
would
catch
in
the
roughnesses
of
the
bark
but
either
from
the
quickness
of
the
action
or
the
slight
extent
to
which
it
was
lifted
i
did
not
notice
this
i
have
also
seen
the
great
green
woodpecker
make
exactly
this
same
motion
downwards
and
backwards
on
the
trunk
to
which
he
was
clinging
so
perhaps
all
true
birds
may
be
able
to
descend
in
this
fashion
should
they
wish
it
though
to
do
so
head
first
may
be
beyond
the
power
or
rather
the
habit
of
most
of
them
this
certainly
i
have
never
seen
the
do
but
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
were
i
to
some
day
and
in
describing
the
habits
of
any
bird
never
excepting
in
extreme
cases
is
in
my
opinion
a
word
that
should
never
be
used
the
tit
however
though
only
an
amateur
does
as
we
have
seen
descend
the
trunk
head
downwards
showing
to
this
extent
at
least
a
superiority
over
a
much
greater
master
of
the
art
but
here
we
have
the
flutter
whether
helped
out
by
the
use
of
the
feet
or
not
and
we
can
imagine
that
as
the
bird
became
more
and
more
a
true
creeper
and
used
the
wings
less
and
less
he
might
cease
to
descend
and
only
creep
upwards
it
must
however
be
remembered
that
all
the
tits
are
accustomed
to
hang
head
downwards
from
twigs
and
branches
in
an
uncommon
degree
so
that
a
member
of
the
family
developing
along
these
lines
might
find
it
easier
to
descend
the
trunk
or
make
greater
efforts
to
overcome
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
than
a
bird
whose
habits
in
this
respect
were
less
pronounced
tits
perch
more
generally
amongst
the
higher
branches
of
trees
and
have
no
particular
habit
of
hopping
about
the
ground
or
creeping
over
and
about
the
tangle
of
a
tree
projecting
roots
which
i
have
often
watched
wrens
doing
those
which
i
saw
did
not
fly
or
at
any
rate
i
did
not
notice
that
they
did
from
the
tree
they
were
on
so
as
to
alight
upon
another
at
a
lower
elevation
but
they
were
hardly
systematic
enough
to
let
one
judge
properly
as
to
this
the
wren
however
both
in
this
respect
and
in
its
general
had
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
with
which
bird
if
i
read
the
systematic
tangle
i
mean
in
print
aright
he
is
more
closely
related
than
are
the
tits
howsoever
these
things
be
i
fear
i
have
dwelt
too
long
upon
them
but
whole
books
are
written
upon
a
war
or
even
a
battle
the
little
is
a
very
delightful
bird
to
watch
sometimes
on
inclement
winter
days
one
can
come
very
near
him
very
near
indeed
and
almost
forget
the
cold
the
rain
the
sleet
in
his
active
busy
little
comfort
to
see
him
then
creeping
like
a
feathered
mouse
over
some
stunted
and
insinuating
his
slender
little
bill
into
every
chink
and
crevice
of
the
bark
so
busy
so
happy
so
daintily
and
innocently
destructive
his
head
which
is
as
the
sentient
handle
to
a
very
delicate
instrument
is
moved
with
such
science
such
that
one
feels
and
appreciates
each
turn
of
it
and
by
sympathy
seems
working
oneself
with
a
little
probing
sickle
that
is
seen
even
when
invisible
as
is
the
fine
wire
or
revolving
horror
in
one
tooth
whilst
sitting
in
the
dreadful
chair
after
watching
him
thus
almost
sometimes
bending
over
him
i
have
broken
off
some
pieces
of
bark
to
form
an
idea
of
what
he
might
be
getting
a
minute
spider
and
a
small
chrysalis
or
two
would
be
revealed
but
there
were
generally
many
of
larger
hybernating
spiders
whilst
empty
pupa
shells
and
other
such
debris
suggested
pasture
sufficient
to
lard
many
rother
sides
and
again
i
wonder
why
there
are
not
more
professional
why
countries
so
rich
and
defenceless
are
not
more
invaded
in
the
name
of
something
or
other
evolution
will
here
serve
the
turn
but
in
spite
of
this
abundance
the
does
not
quite
confine
himself
to
searching
the
bark
of
trees
for
i
have
seen
him
on
one
occasion
dart
suddenly
out
and
catch
a
fly
or
other
insect
in
the
air
returning
immediately
afterwards
to
his
tree
again
to
my
surprise
i
can
not
find
this
in
my
notes
but
as
my
memory
is
quite
clear
upon
the
point
i
mention
it
this
is
another
method
of
procuring
food
which
as
an
occasional
practice
is
widely
disseminated
amongst
our
smaller
birds
and
here
again
one
wonders
why
it
has
only
become
a
fixed
habit
with
the
however
i
have
seen
a
male
chaffinch
dash
from
the
bank
of
a
river
and
catch
in
sometimes
a
little
and
sometimes
only
just
above
the
surface
of
the
water
several
times
in
succession
so
that
in
this
case
also
we
see
the
possible
beginnings
of
another
species
i
have
forgotten
to
admire
the
i
mean
as
a
thing
of
beauty
to
do
so
is
a
very
refined
sensation
he
is
so
and
one
is
an
æsthete
for
the
time
but
the
next
dethrones
one
for
one
has
to
admire
him
too
and
with
his
briskness
and
his
christian
name
of
tom
is
hardly
æsthetic
the
hardiness
of
these
little
creatures
i
am
speaking
here
of
the
tits
but
to
both
it
would
apply
is
wonderful
quite
wonderful
they
are
downy
iron
soft
little
of
nature
very
hardest
material
it
is
now
for
i
select
a
striking
example
the
most
atrocious
weather
a
howling
wind
and
sleet
or
sleety
snow
that
seems
as
it
falls
to
thaw
and
freeze
upon
one
hands
both
at
the
same
time
later
it
becomes
almost
a
storm
with
more
snow
it
is
indeed
a
day
terrible
to
bird
and
beast
in
the
general
as
well
as
to
man
yet
through
it
all
these
tiny
little
bits
of
natural
are
feeding
on
the
small
february
buds
of
some
elms
that
roar
in
the
wind
wonderful
it
is
to
see
them
blown
and
swayed
about
with
the
whirling
about
them
as
they
hang
high
up
from
the
extremities
of
slender
twigs
playing
their
little
as
important
in
the
sum
of
things
as
napoleon
with
absolute
ease
and
whilst
one
is
almost
frozen
to
look
at
them
one
must
think
of
shakespeare
lines
about
the
wet
shipboy
in
a
night
so
rude
but
what
a
poor
mollycoddle
was
he
by
comparison
later
they
will
sleep
these
robust
little
feathered
ariels
to
the
tempest
lullaby
above
a
world
all
snow
and
with
frozen
snow
the
whole
way
up
the
trunk
of
every
unprotected
tree
on
the
windward
side
now
it
is
dinner
with
appetite
and
entire
comfort
in
the
cauld
blast
what
insects
are
in
these
tiny
little
new
buds
or
are
there
insects
in
each
one
for
these
tits
browse
from
one
to
another
and
seem
equally
satisfied
with
all
yet
it
is
authoritatively
stated
that
they
eat
only
the
insects
in
buds
and
not
the
buds
themselves
in
watching
birds
however
as
in
other
things
one
should
be
guided
by
a
few
simple
rules
and
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
is
absolutely
to
ignore
all
statements
whatever
without
the
smallest
regard
to
authority
everything
should
be
new
to
you
there
should
be
no
such
thing
as
a
fact
till
you
have
discovered
it
note
down
everything
as
a
discovery
and
never
mind
who
knew
it
or
knew
that
it
was
not
so
before
you
may
be
wrong
of
course
so
may
the
authority
but
what
makes
authority
in
a
matter
of
observation
to
me
it
certainly
seemed
that
these
tits
ate
the
at
any
rate
i
have
broken
a
spray
off
a
low
bough
where
i
had
seen
one
feeding
and
taken
it
home
on
examining
it
i
found
many
a
little
bare
stalk
where
buds
had
been
which
suggests
that
they
had
been
eaten
and
not
merely
pecked
at
i
tried
several
of
these
little
buds
it
was
in
february
myself
and
found
them
very
nice
and
delicate
later
in
april
i
have
noted
down
the
buds
being
now
larger
i
can
see
the
birds
pecking
and
tugging
at
them
more
plainly
and
now
and
then
a
minute
flutters
to
the
ground
i
certainly
think
it
is
the
buds
themselves
they
are
attacking
for
their
own
sake
as
feed
at
the
stacks
certainly
not
on
insects
and
eat
i
believe
meat
and
in
fact
almost
everything
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
they
neglected
such
a
rich
as
the
buds
of
trees
would
yield
them
or
if
they
did
not
care
about
them
on
such
a
day
as
i
have
described
one
can
understand
them
feeding
hour
after
hour
and
making
themselves
rotund
on
the
tiny
little
buds
themselves
but
hardly
on
insects
contained
in
them
the
bullfinch
at
any
rate
is
known
to
be
a
and
he
may
often
be
seen
feeding
on
the
elms
in
company
with
the
and
to
all
appearance
in
just
the
same
way
it
is
marvellous
what
slender
little
twigs
this
bird
will
perch
on
without
their
giving
way
beneath
his
round
burly
form
sometimes
they
do
give
way
and
then
he
swings
about
on
them
like
a
ball
at
the
end
of
a
piece
of
string
nor
does
he
get
off
on
to
another
one
without
a
good
deal
of
turmoil
and
some
climbing
which
can
not
be
called
quite
in
fact
he
is
awkward
but
in
the
most
graceful
manner
imaginable
harpagon
as
we
know
grace
a
and
when
a
bird
like
the
bullfinch
condescends
for
a
moment
to
be
awkward
his
charm
is
merely
enhanced
yet
i
can
not
call
him
deft
in
the
procurement
of
buds
as
the
is
with
whom
he
comes
into
competition
and
whom
he
will
drive
away
he
does
not
hang
nibbling
at
them
head
downwards
as
though
to
the
manner
born
and
then
swing
up
again
on
a
these
things
if
not
beyond
him
are
at
least
alien
to
his
disposition
which
is
straightforward
and
to
his
deportment
which
has
a
certain
sobriety
his
plan
therefore
is
to
advance
along
the
twig
as
far
as
it
seems
to
him
advisable
to
go
and
then
stretching
forward
and
elongating
his
neck
take
a
sharp
bite
at
the
bud
which
with
his
powerful
bill
secures
it
at
once
unless
he
fails
in
the
same
way
he
will
stretch
out
from
the
twig
he
is
on
to
secure
the
bud
on
another
but
this
he
does
still
more
cautiously
at
the
when
feeding
on
the
same
tree
he
will
sometimes
make
little
dashes
driving
him
away
he
has
in
fact
just
done
so
only
in
this
instance
it
was
the
hen
bird
three
times
in
succession
and
now
a
fourth
time
has
this
hen
bullfinch
made
a
dash
at
the
the
tit
each
time
flutters
away
easily
and
without
making
any
fuss
about
it
he
is
insulted
but
he
does
not
wish
to
make
a
scene
besides
he
is
smaller
the
catkins
too
are
now
hanging
on
the
alders
and
on
these
also
or
if
any
one
prefers
it
on
the
insects
in
them
the
feed
they
i
think
prefer
the
catkins
but
i
will
not
be
sure
whenever
practicable
they
grasp
a
catkin
with
one
claw
and
the
twig
from
which
it
hangs
and
which
is
their
main
support
with
the
other
often
however
they
grasp
catkin
and
twig
together
with
both
claws
and
standing
thus
peck
down
upon
them
like
parva
si
magnis
licet
comparare
a
crow
or
hawk
upon
some
dead
or
living
creature
or
again
they
will
hang
head
downwards
from
and
pecking
at
a
bunch
of
the
catkins
without
any
more
substantial
support
or
with
one
claw
grasping
one
twig
will
with
the
other
hold
a
catkin
belonging
to
another
twig
up
to
the
beak
like
a
parrot
the
claws
of
tits
are
evidently
of
high
value
as
seizers
and
holders
if
not
quite
as
pickers
and
stealers
they
are
much
more
than
mere
rivets
for
fixing
themselves
on
a
perch
to
see
one
of
these
little
birds
whilst
straddled
in
this
way
pull
the
catkin
towards
it
is
most
interesting
and
very
pretty
the
little
legs
are
so
thin
and
delicate
that
one
must
be
very
close
or
get
a
very
steady
look
through
the
glasses
both
to
see
and
at
the
same
time
distinguish
them
from
the
twigs
the
is
even
more
parrot
or
rather
and
one
can
make
out
his
actions
better
for
he
sits
upright
one
may
almost
say
on
the
ground
beneath
a
supporting
himself
with
his
tail
and
one
claw
whilst
the
other
grasps
a
at
which
he
pecks
at
least
i
think
it
was
a
and
i
afterwards
picked
up
several
which
were
marked
with
little
pits
round
the
base
where
it
had
joined
the
stalk
difficult
to
attribute
to
squirrels
and
suggesting
that
the
birds
had
severed
them
in
this
way
and
not
yet
proceeded
farther
if
the
does
this
then
it
seems
likely
that
the
does
so
also
in
which
case
his
extracting
the
seeds
from
the
larger
cones
of
exotic
firs
would
be
only
what
one
might
expect
the
too
ascends
the
trunks
of
trees
scotch
especially
in
the
same
fluttering
way
as
does
the
but
perhaps
still
more
deftly
in
search
of
insects
and
often
as
one
watches
him
a
flake
of
the
bark
that
he
has
detached
comes
fluttering
down
the
wren
may
do
the
same
but
i
have
been
more
struck
by
the
way
in
which
this
little
bird
flies
about
amidst
the
from
one
to
another
he
hangs
from
them
head
downwards
but
often
before
clinging
amongst
them
flutters
just
above
or
sometimes
just
below
them
in
the
latter
case
it
seems
as
though
the
needles
were
flowers
and
that
he
was
probing
them
with
his
bill
whilst
hanging
in
the
air
like
a
and
this
amidst
the
dark
pines
and
especially
on
a
gloomy
winter
day
is
odd
to
see
often
he
flits
down
from
his
into
the
coarse
tufty
grass
just
bounding
the
plantation
bustles
and
there
for
a
little
then
is
up
again
amongst
his
needles
pecking
the
frost
from
them
for
this
is
what
it
looks
like
that
seems
to
be
the
meal
he
is
making
though
surely
it
must
really
be
something
more
substantial
if
meal
and
substantial
are
words
that
can
be
properly
used
in
respect
of
a
being
so
tiny
and
delicate
however
he
seems
busily
examining
the
and
this
may
be
either
for
minute
insects
upon
them
or
for
the
very
small
buds
which
they
bear
it
is
pleasant
to
watch
these
little
birds
and
to
hear
their
little
needley
note
of
tzee
tzee
tzee
sometimes
however
but
this
is
more
as
spring
comes
on
they
will
fly
excitedly
about
amidst
the
trees
and
bushes
uttering
quite
a
loud
chattering
note
far
louder
than
one
could
have
expected
from
the
size
of
the
bird
returning
to
our
on
their
they
have
all
flown
into
it
being
a
band
of
about
twenty
from
a
small
a
few
paces
off
excepting
for
some
lichen
here
and
there
on
its
branches
this
is
bare
and
the
birds
seem
far
more
occupied
in
preening
themselves
and
in
giving
every
now
and
again
the
little
birdy
wipe
of
the
bill
first
on
one
side
and
then
another
of
a
twig
or
bough
than
in
any
serious
guttling
for
this
they
fly
to
the
alder
where
at
once
they
are
feeding
busily
but
i
notice
that
every
now
and
again
some
few
of
them
fly
back
into
the
hawthorn
where
they
sit
a
little
preening
themselves
as
before
before
returning
in
fact
they
use
the
as
their
whilst
the
alder
is
the
great
once
or
twice
i
think
it
was
twice
i
saw
one
dart
at
another
and
drive
it
from
its
particular
catkin
as
they
had
a
whole
large
tree
to
themselves
this
i
think
was
pretty
good
illustration
artillery
pecking
catkins
in
but
i
have
never
seen
the
behave
so
prettily
and
airily
with
its
catkins
as
i
have
the
little
in
april
these
little
birds
are
then
constantly
pursuing
each
other
about
through
the
trees
and
especially
the
for
which
they
seem
to
have
a
decided
preference
perhaps
because
they
make
a
fairy
setting
for
their
fairy
selves
they
affect
its
catkins
and
one
of
the
most
pleasing
of
things
is
to
see
them
shoot
through
the
yet
thin
veil
of
green
give
a
flying
peck
at
one
and
become
immediately
enveloped
in
a
little
yellow
cloud
of
the
pollen
it
looks
indeed
as
if
the
bird
had
shaken
it
from
its
own
feathers
for
its
intimate
actions
are
too
quick
and
small
to
be
followed
and
the
pollen
is
all
around
it
but
as
the
eye
marks
the
tiny
explosion
with
delight
reason
quickly
following
as
delightedly
tells
you
the
why
of
it
and
a
plucked
catkin
illustrates
this
is
all
in
the
early
fresh
morning
when
the
earth
is
like
a
and
all
the
influences
so
lovely
that
one
wonders
how
sin
and
sorrow
can
have
entered
into
such
a
world
it
seems
as
though
nature
must
be
at
her
fairest
for
so
fairy
a
thing
to
be
done
i
at
least
have
not
seen
it
take
place
later
and
i
can
not
help
hoping
that
no
one
else
will
but
why
do
the
little
birds
explode
their
catkins
do
their
sharp
eyes
each
time
see
an
insect
upon
them
or
do
they
really
enjoy
the
thing
for
its
own
sake
i
can
see
no
reason
why
this
latter
should
not
be
the
case
or
even
if
it
is
not
so
to
any
great
degree
now
why
it
should
not
come
to
be
so
in
time
it
must
be
exciting
surely
this
sudden
little
puff
of
yellow
and
then
there
is
the
beauty
of
it
there
was
much
laughter
naturally
when
darwin
propounded
the
theory
that
birds
could
admire
and
when
he
instanced
the
and
particularly
one
that
makes
itself
an
attractive
little
removing
the
blossoms
as
soon
as
they
fade
and
replacing
them
with
fresh
ones
it
was
held
that
such
cases
as
these
were
decisive
against
his
views
gradually
however
it
began
to
be
seen
that
they
pointed
rather
in
the
opposite
direction
and
now
it
is
recognised
that
darwin
was
right
this
being
so
it
does
not
appear
to
me
absolutely
necessary
to
suppose
that
when
the
little
flies
at
his
catkin
and
produces
one
of
the
prettiest
little
effects
imaginable
he
does
so
always
merely
to
get
a
fly
or
a
gnat
there
are
other
possibilities
and
i
think
that
if
our
common
birds
were
minutely
and
patiently
watched
we
might
trace
here
and
there
in
their
actions
the
beginnings
of
some
of
those
more
wonderful
ones
which
obtain
amongst
birds
far
away

chapter
x
watching
rooks
in
this
chapter
i
will
give
a
few
scenes
from
rook
life
as
i
have
watched
it
from
late
autumn
to
early
spring
linking
them
together
by
a
remark
now
and
again
of
a
general
nature
or
possibly
some
theory
which
my
observations
may
have
suggested
to
me
and
seemed
to
illustrate
were
i
to
put
into
general
terms
what
i
have
jotted
down
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
in
the
darkness
before
morning
when
the
rookery
slept
about
me
in
the
dim
dawn
whilst
it
woke
into
life
to
stream
forth
later
on
wings
of
joy
and
sound
in
the
long
day
by
field
and
moor
and
waste
and
at
evening
again
or
night
when
the
birds
swept
home
and
sank
to
sleep
amidst
their
own
sinking
lullaby
i
might
make
a
smoother
narrative
but
the
picture
would
be
gone
i
think
it
better
therefore
to
make
a
preliminary
general
apology
for
all
roughnesses
and
repetitions
triviality
of
matter
minuteness
of
detail
and
so
forth
in
fact
for
all
shortcomings
and
then
to
go
on
in
faith
not
in
myself
indeed
but
in
the
rooks
believing
that
they
be
interesting
however
much
i
may
stand
in
their
way
when
i
speak
of
the
rookery
i
do
not
mean
the
trees
where
the
birds
build
unfortunately
there
are
none
very
near
me
but
those
where
they
come
to
roost
during
the
autumn
and
winter
true
rookeries
indeed
if
numbers
count
for
anything
here
their
chosen
is
a
silent
lonely
plantation
of
tall
funereal
firs
standing
shaggily
tangled
together
mournful
and
sombre
making
when
the
snow
has
fallen
but
lightly
before
they
are
covered
a
blotch
of
very
ink
upon
the
surrounding
white
who
could
think
seeing
them
during
the
daytime
so
sad
and
abandoned
so
utterly
still
tenanted
only
by
a
few
tits
or
some
squirrel
whose
pertness
amidst
their
gloomy
aisles
and
avenues
seems
almost
an
affectation
who
could
think
that
each
night
they
were
so
clothed
and
mantled
with
life
that
their
sadness
was
all
covered
up
in
joy
their
silence
made
a
babel
of
sound
in
every
one
of
those
dark
swaying
sighing
trees
there
will
be
a
very
crowd
of
black
noisy
joyous
birds
and
strange
it
is
that
there
should
be
more
poetry
in
all
this
noise
and
clamour
and
bustle
than
in
their
sad
sombreness
deeply
as
that
speaks
to
one
the
poetry
of
life
is
beyond
that
of
death
and
when
the
rooks
have
gone
the
dark
plantation
seems
to
want
its
soul
it
is
cupid
and
psyche
but
under
dreary
northern
skies
every
evening
the
black
rushing
wings
come
in
love
and
seem
to
kiss
the
dark
branches
every
morning
they
kiss
and
part
and
between
whiles
the
poor
longing
grove
stands
lifeless
dreams
and
waits
but
how
different
would
it
seem
if
the
rooks
were
a
crowd
of
men
nice
cheery
jovial
picturesque
civilised
men
thank
heaven
they
are
a
crowd
of
rooks
i
will
now
quote
from
my
journal
walking
over
some
arable
land
that
rises
gently
into
a
slight
hill
my
attention
is
attracted
by
a
number
of
rooks
hanging
in
the
air
just
above
a
small
clump
of
on
its
crest
they
keep
alternately
rising
and
falling
as
they
circle
over
the
trees
often
perching
amongst
them
but
soon
gliding
upwards
from
them
again
a
very
common
action
is
for
two
to
hover
one
above
another
getting
gradually
quite
close
together
when
both
sinking
one
may
almost
say
falling
rapidly
the
upper
pursues
the
under
one
striking
at
it
either
in
jest
or
earnest
but
probably
the
former
both
with
beak
and
claws
the
downward
plunge
would
end
in
a
long
swoop
first
to
right
or
left
and
then
again
upwards
during
which
the
two
would
become
separated
and
mingled
with
the
general
troop
this
action
more
or
less
defined
and
perfect
was
continued
again
and
again
and
there
were
generally
one
or
more
pairs
of
birds
engaged
in
it
the
rest
rose
and
fell
many
together
and
obviously
enjoying
each
other
society
but
without
any
special
conjunction
of
two
or
more
in
a
joint
manœuvre
their
descents
were
often
of
a
rushing
nature
and
accompanied
with
such
sudden
twists
and
turns
as
sometimes
seemed
to
amount
to
a
complete
somersault
in
the
air
though
as
to
this
i
will
not
be
too
certain
the
whole
seemed
the
outcome
of
pure
enjoyment
and
seen
in
the
clear
blue
sky
of
this
fine
bright
october
morning
the
last
one
of
the
month
had
a
charming
effect
a
fortnight
later
i
happened
to
be
near
some
woods
to
which
rooks
were
flying
from
all
directions
to
roost
as
i
thought
then
but
afterwards
i
found
it
was
only
one
of
their
halting
places
they
were
in
countless
numbers
one
great
troop
after
another
flying
up
from
far
away
over
the
country
the
air
was
full
of
their
voices
which
were
of
a
great
variety
and
modulation
the
ordinary
harsh
though
pleasant
being
perhaps
the
least
noticeable
of
all
each
troop
flew
high
and
on
coming
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
wood
a
field
away
they
suddenly
began
to
swoop
down
upon
it
in
long
sweeping
curves
or
slants
at
the
same
time
uttering
a
very
peculiar
burring
note
which
though
much
deeper
and
essentially
in
tone
at
once
reminded
me
of
the
sound
made
by
the
nightjar
imagine
a
rook
trying
to
or
like
a
nightjar
and
doing
it
like
a
rook
and
you
have
it
whilst
making
these
long
swoops
the
birds
would
often
twist
and
turn
in
the
air
in
an
astonishing
manner
sometimes
even
as
it
seemed
to
me
turning
right
over
as
a
peewit
does
in
fact
exhibiting
powers
of
flight
far
beyond
what
anyone
would
imagine
rooks
to
possess
who
had
only
seen
or
noticed
them
on
ordinary
occasions
whilst
these
birds
sweep
down
into
the
trees
others
of
them
settle
on
the
adjoining
but
they
do
not
descend
upon
it
in
the
same
way
but
more
steadily
though
still
with
many
a
twist
and
turn
and
whirring
whizzing
evolution
neither
do
they
utter
the
strange
burring
note
to
which
i
have
called
attention
and
which
is
a
very
striking
sound
starlings
are
mingled
with
these
latter
birds
flying
amongst
them
yet
in
their
own
bands
and
alighting
with
them
on
the
meadow
where
they
continue
to
form
an
in
both
they
and
the
rooks
descend
at
one
point
in
a
black
or
brown
patch
but
soon
spread
out
over
the
whole
meadow
from
which
they
often
rise
up
in
a
cloud
and
after
flying
about
over
it
for
a
little
come
down
upon
it
again
at
last
a
vast
flock
of
starlings
numbering
i
should
think
many
thousands
flies
up
and
being
joined
by
all
those
that
were
on
the
field
the
whole
descend
upon
the
woods
through
which
they
disseminate
themselves
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
rooks
as
though
taking
the
starlings
for
their
guide
rise
too
and
fly
all
together
to
the
woods
now
comes
a
troop
of
some
eighty
rooks
and
shortly
afterwards
another
much
larger
one
two
or
three
hundred
at
the
least
all
flying
high
and
going
steadily
onwards
in
one
uniform
direction
they
are
all
uttering
a
note
which
is
difficult
to
describe
and
does
not
at
all
resemble
the
ordinary
it
has
more
the
character
of
a
chirrup
loud
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
bird
but
still
a
chirrup
or
chirruppy
there
is
great
flexibility
in
the
sound
which
has
a
curious
rise
at
the
end
it
seems
to
express
satisfaction
and
enjoyable
social
feeling
and
if
so
is
very
expressive
one
feels
indeed
that
every
note
uttered
by
rooks
is
expressive
and
if
one
does
not
always
quite
know
what
it
expresses
that
is
one
own
fault
or
at
any
rate
not
theirs
twenty
more
now
pass
then
and
finally
another
large
body
of
some
two
to
three
hundred
all
flying
in
the
same
direction
it
is
the
last
flight
and
shortly
afterwards
the
loud
harsh
trumpeting
of
pheasants
is
heard
in
all
the
woods
and
coverts
around
as
they
prepare
to
fly
up
into
their
own
roosting
trees
this
of
two
accustomed
things
in
the
daily
life
of
rooks
and
pheasants
i
have
often
noticed
but
it
must
be
mere
coincidence
for
pheasants
vary
in
their
hours
of
retirement
whilst
the
leisurely
homeward
journeying
of
rooks
with
pauses
longer
or
shorter
at
one
place
or
another
occupies
in
winter
most
of
the
afternoon
by
the
river
this
afternoon
i
noticed
two
great
assemblages
of
rooks
down
on
the
whilst
others
in
large
numbers
were
flying
homewards
of
these
two
would
often
act
in
the
way
i
have
before
described
that
is
to
say
whilst
flying
the
one
just
over
the
other
with
very
little
space
between
them
both
would
sink
suddenly
and
swiftly
down
the
upper
following
the
under
one
and
both
keeping
for
some
time
the
same
relative
position
but
besides
this
two
birds
would
often
pursue
each
other
downwards
in
a
different
way
descending
with
wide
sideway
sweeps
through
the
air
from
one
side
to
another
after
the
manner
of
a
parachute
the
wings
being
all
the
while
outstretched
and
motionless
in
either
case
the
pursuit
was
never
persisted
in
for
long
and
obviously
it
was
no
more
than
a
sport
or
an
evolution
requiring
the
concurrence
of
two
birds
again
two
will
sweep
along
near
together
at
slightly
different
altitudes
with
the
wings
outspread
in
the
same
way
that
is
to
say
not
flapping
then
first
one
and
afterwards
the
other
gives
a
sharp
wriggling
twist
seeming
to
lose
its
balance
for
a
moment
rights
itself
again
and
continues
to
sweep
on
as
before
then
another
wriggle
a
further
sweep
and
so
on
since
seeing
the
curious
manner
in
which
ravens
roll
over
in
the
air
as
described
by
me
i
have
watched
the
aerial
gambols
as
one
may
almost
call
them
of
rooks
more
closely
there
is
a
certain
place
not
far
from
where
i
live
where
these
birds
make
an
aerial
pause
in
their
homeward
flight
for
whilst
many
are
to
be
seen
settled
in
some
lofty
trees
of
a
fine
open
park
others
sail
round
and
round
in
wide
circles
and
high
in
the
air
over
a
wide
expanse
of
water
in
the
midst
of
it
after
wheeling
thus
for
some
time
first
one
and
then
another
will
descend
on
spread
wings
very
swiftly
and
with
all
sorts
of
whizzes
or
tumbles
and
motions
when
watched
closely
through
the
glasses
however
it
may
be
seen
that
very
often
these
rushing
descents
have
their
origin
in
an
action
or
rather
an
attempted
action
very
much
like
that
of
the
raven
the
idea
of
the
latter
bird
is
to
roll
over
so
as
to
be
on
its
back
in
the
air
and
by
closing
its
wings
it
is
able
to
achieve
this
without
or
with
hardly
any
drop
from
the
elevation
at
which
it
has
been
flying
the
rooks
seem
to
try
to
do
this
too
but
instead
of
closing
the
wings
they
keep
them
spread
as
open
or
almost
so
as
before
consequently
instead
of
just
rolling
over
their
turn
or
roll
to
either
side
sends
them
skimming
sideways
down
through
the
air
like
a
kite
a
paper
one
i
mean
peewits
close
the
wings
and
roll
over
in
much
the
same
way
as
does
the
raven
but
this
is
generally
either
preceded
or
followed
by
a
tremendous
drop
through
the
air
with
wings
more
or
less
extended
so
that
the
whole
has
quite
a
different
effect
of
the
two
assemblies
on
the
ground
one
is
in
perpetual
motion
birds
constantly
rising
either
singly
in
twos
or
threes
or
in
small
parties
from
where
they
were
flying
a
little
way
just
above
the
heads
of
their
fellows
and
amongst
them
again
thus
no
individual
bird
as
it
seems
to
me
remains
where
it
was
for
long
though
those
in
the
air
at
any
given
moment
form
but
a
small
minority
compared
with
the
main
body
on
the
ground
but
the
birds
composing
the
other
great
assemblage
keep
their
places
or
if
some
few
rise
to
change
them
these
are
not
enough
to
give
character
to
the
whole
or
even
to
attract
attention
it
is
curious
to
see
two
such
great
bodies
of
birds
close
to
each
other
and
on
the
same
uniform
yet
behaving
so
differently
the
one
so
still
the
other
in
such
constant
activity
about
a
great
number
of
rooks
rise
from
some
trees
in
a
small
covert
near
by
and
fly
towards
those
on
the
ground
as
they
approach
the
first
great
body
which
is
the
lively
one
the
birds
composing
it
rise
up
as
with
one
accord
and
fly
not
to
meet
them
as
one
might
have
expected
but
in
the
same
direction
as
they
are
flying
so
nicely
timed
however
is
the
movement
that
the
rising
body
become
in
a
moment
the
vanguard
of
the
now
combined
troop
all
these
birds
then
fly
together
to
the
other
assembly
and
whilst
about
half
of
their
number
sweep
down
to
reinforce
it
the
other
half
continue
to
fly
on
the
flying
rooks
however
are
not
joined
by
any
of
those
on
the
ground
how
curious
it
is
that
in
the
first
instance
the
one
whole
body
of
birds
does
the
same
thing
instantaneously
and
as
by
a
common
impulse
whilst
in
the
second
half
acts
in
one
way
and
half
in
another
each
appearing
to
have
no
doubt
or
hesitation
as
to
what
it
ought
to
do
again
how
different
is
the
conduct
of
the
two
one
rises
as
with
one
thought
to
join
the
flying
birds
the
other
as
with
one
thought
remains
standing
unless
in
each
case
some
signal
of
command
has
been
given
then
what
a
strange
community
of
feeling
in
opposite
directions
is
here
shown
where
is
the
individuality
that
one
would
expect
and
what
is
the
power
that
binds
all
the
units
together
rooks
led
by
an
old
and
experienced
bird
which
is
i
believe
the
popular
impression
as
embodied
in
a
famous
line
of
tennyson
for
which
one
feels
inclined
to
fight
at
first
sight
the
rising
of
a
whole
body
of
rooks
or
any
other
birds
simultaneously
either
from
the
ground
or
a
tree
might
seem
to
be
most
easily
explained
on
the
theory
of
one
bird
recognised
as
the
chief
of
the
band
having
in
some
manner
either
by
a
cry
or
by
its
own
flight
given
a
signal
which
was
instantly
obeyed
by
the
rest
but
how
in
the
case
of
rooks
can
any
one
note
be
heard
by
all
amidst
such
a
babel
as
there
often
is
and
how
can
every
bird
in
a
band
of
some
hundreds
or
even
some
scores
have
its
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
some
particular
one
amongst
them
that
ought
indeed
on
ordinary
physical
and
mechanical
principles
to
be
invisible
to
the
greater
number
if
however
to
meet
this
latter
difficulty
we
suppose
that
only
a
certain
number
of
birds
who
are
in
close
proximity
to
the
leader
see
and
obey
the
signal
and
that
these
are
followed
by
those
nearest
to
them
and
so
on
till
the
whole
are
in
motion
then
two
other
difficulties
arise
neither
of
which
seems
easy
to
get
over
for
in
the
first
place
the
birds
do
not
in
many
cases
appear
to
rise
in
this
manner
but
as
in
the
instances
here
given
simultaneously
or
at
least
with
a
nearer
approach
to
it
than
any
process
of
spreading
such
as
here
supposed
would
seem
to
admit
of
and
secondly
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
if
this
were
the
case
any
bird
or
at
least
any
few
birds
could
fly
up
without
putting
all
the
others
in
motion
yet
as
i
have
mentioned
birds
in
twos
or
threes
or
in
small
parties
were
constantly
rising
and
flying
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
assemblage
of
which
they
formed
a
part
whilst
the
vast
majority
remained
where
they
were
on
the
ground
this
fact
offers
an
equal
or
a
still
greater
difficulty
if
dismissing
the
idea
of
there
being
a
recognised
leader
we
suppose
that
any
bird
may
for
the
moment
become
one
by
taking
the
initiative
of
flight
or
otherwise
and
even
if
we
assume
that
any
of
these
explanations
is
the
correct
one
in
the
case
of
a
whole
body
of
rooks
taking
sudden
flight
or
directing
their
flight
to
any
particular
place
or
with
any
special
purpose
what
are
we
to
think
when
half
or
a
certain
number
of
the
band
does
one
thing
and
the
other
half
another
each
apparently
with
equal
spontaneity
we
are
met
here
with
the
same
difficulties
and
perhaps
in
a
still
higher
degree
as
in
the
case
of
the
flocks
of
small
birds
at
the
stacks
in
winter
if
rooks
follow
and
obey
a
leader
one
might
expect
them
to
do
so
habitually
at
least
in
their
more
important
matters
the
flight
out
from
the
in
the
morning
and
the
flight
into
them
again
at
night
are
when
it
is
not
the
the
two
daily
of
a
rook
life
here
then
are
two
subjects
for
special
observation
at
i
take
up
my
position
on
the
edge
of
a
little
a
short
distance
from
where
i
watched
yesterday
and
the
last
few
days
my
object
is
to
watch
the
flights
of
rooks
as
they
pass
and
try
to
settle
if
each
band
has
a
recognised
leader
or
not
of
course
it
is
obvious
that
no
one
bird
can
lead
the
various
bands
for
these
come
from
over
a
large
tract
of
country
whilst
even
those
that
seem
most
to
make
one
general
army
fly
often
at
considerable
intervals
of
time
and
quite
out
of
sight
of
each
other
a
good
many
are
already
flying
in
the
accustomed
direction
but
singly
or
wide
apart
each
bird
seems
to
be
entirely
independent
the
first
band
now
approaches
one
rook
is
much
in
advance
for
some
distance
he
then
deviates
and
is
passed
by
the
greater
number
of
the
others
who
continue
on
their
way
without
regard
to
him
another
great
irregular
straggling
body
in
which
i
can
discern
no
sign
whatever
of
leadership
then
comes
another
more
compact
a
rook
that
at
first
leads
by
a
long
interval
is
passed
by
first
one
and
then
another
so
that
he
becomes
one
of
the
general
body
a
large
band
flying
very
high
two
birds
fly
nearly
parallel
at
some
distance
ahead
two
large
bands
also
very
high
in
each
one
bird
is
a
good
way
ahead
the
apparent
leader
of
the
second
band
increases
his
distance
curves
a
good
deal
out
of
the
line
originally
pursued
nor
do
the
others
alter
their
course
in
accordance
two
other
bands
in
each
the
leader
theory
seems
untenable
the
birds
have
a
broadly
extended
front
and
fly
at
different
elevations
there
is
nothing
that
suggests
concerted
movement
but
on
the
contrary
great
irregularity
in
another
band
the
apparent
leader
swoops
down
to
the
ground
and
whilst
only
or
so
follow
him
the
main
body
proceeds
on
its
way
hitherto
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
the
familiar
cawing
noise
but
now
a
number
of
birds
fly
joyously
up
hang
floating
in
the
air
make
twists
and
tumbles
perform
antics
and
evolutions
and
descend
upon
the
ground
with
wide
swoops
from
side
to
side
the
wings
outspread
and
without
a
flap
i
am
first
made
aware
of
their
approach
by
the
complete
change
of
note
it
is
now
the
flexible
croodling
upturned
note
rising
at
the
end
i
mean
that
i
know
not
how
to
describe
totally
different
from
the
nor
do
i
hear
a
from
any
of
these
descending
birds
it
is
the
note
of
joy
and
sport
of
joyous
sport
in
the
air
of
antics
there
as
they
sweep
joyously
down
through
it
that
i
now
hear
the
birds
that
caw
are
flying
steadily
and
soberly
by
the
is
the
steady
note
of
the
day
daily
toil
and
business
on
jog
on
the
footpath
way
another
great
band
of
such
length
and
straggling
formation
that
the
birds
in
the
latter
part
of
it
could
not
possibly
see
the
leader
if
there
were
one
or
indeed
i
should
think
the
vanguard
at
all
the
first
bird
is
passed
by
two
others
then
passes
one
of
these
again
and
remains
the
second
as
long
as
i
can
see
them
another
long
flight
that
seems
leaderless
with
the
comes
a
note
like
but
the
more
as
in
spanish
and
others
that
i
can
not
transcribe
this
flight
goes
on
almost
continuously
i
mean
without
a
distinct
gap
dividing
it
from
another
band
for
about
ten
minutes
when
another
great
multitude
appears
flying
at
an
immense
height
and
all
abreast
as
it
were
that
is
to
say
a
hundred
or
so
in
a
long
line
of
only
a
few
birds
deep
this
perhaps
would
be
the
formation
best
adapted
for
observing
and
following
one
bird
that
flew
well
in
front
but
i
can
see
no
such
one
all
these
birds
are
sailing
calmly
and
serenely
along
giving
only
now
and
again
an
occasional
stroke
or
two
with
the
wings
now
comes
a
further
great
assembly
in
loose
order
all
flying
in
the
same
direction
a
characteristic
of
these
large
flights
of
rooks
is
that
their
van
will
often
pause
in
the
air
and
then
wheel
back
circling
out
to
either
side
the
rearguard
is
thus
checked
in
its
advance
the
birds
of
either
section
streaming
through
each
other
till
the
whole
body
after
circling
and
hanging
in
the
air
for
a
little
like
a
black
eddying
snowstorm
all
at
a
great
height
wend
on
again
in
the
same
direction
towards
their
distant
with
the
air
full
of
the
voice
of
the
birds
there
is
no
caw
only
the
flexible
croodling
chirruppy
note
that
has
a
good
deal
of
music
in
it
as
well
as
of
expression
this
note
i
think
is
what
i
have
put
down
as
there
is
now
a
continuous
straggling
stream
forming
ever
so
many
little
troops
the
first
bird
of
one
troop
tends
to
become
the
last
of
the
one
preceding
it
and
the
last
one
the
leader
of
the
troop
following
then
come
numbers
flying
in
a
very
irregular
and
widely
disseminated
formation
yet
together
in
a
certain
sense
there
is
much
of
rising
and
sinking
and
again
floating
upwards
of
twists
and
twirls
and
sudden
dashing
swoops
downwards
from
side
to
side
like
the
car
of
a
falling
balloon
two
birds
often
pursuing
each
other
in
this
way
and
now
come
two
great
bands
one
flying
all
abreast
as
before
described
the
other
forming
a
great
irregular
leadership
in
the
latter
case
would
be
an
impossibility
in
the
former
i
see
no
sign
of
it
all
these
birds
though
at
a
fair
height
are
flapping
steadily
along
in
the
usual
prosaical
manner
through
them
and
far
above
at
a
very
great
height
indeed
the
highest
i
have
yet
seen
and
far
beyond
anything
i
should
have
imagined
i
see
another
band
gliding
smoothly
majestically
on
with
scarce
an
occasional
stroke
of
the
pinions
the
one
black
band
of
birds
seen
through
the
others
far
far
above
them
has
a
curious
an
inspiring
effect
rooks
when
in
continued
progress
either
fly
with
a
constant
steady
flapping
of
the
wings
in
a
somewhat
laboured
way
though
often
fairly
fast
or
they
sail
along
with
wings
outspread
and
flapping
only
from
time
to
time
this
last
however
only
when
they
are
at
a
considerable
height
a
crowd
of
rooks
indeed
in
the
higher
regions
of
air
present
a
very
different
appearance
to
what
they
do
when
they
fly
about
the
fields
even
though
at
a
fair
height
above
the
trees
their
powers
of
flight
in
each
case
seem
of
a
very
different
kind
they
can
also
soar
to
some
extent
rising
higher
and
higher
on
outspread
wings
as
they
sweep
round
and
round
in
irregular
circles
like
gulls
but
far
less
perfectly
and
they
have
to
flap
the
wings
more
often
add
to
this
their
swoops
their
twists
turns
tumbles
and
all
manner
of
erratic
aerial
evolutions
and
it
must
be
conceded
that
the
powers
of
flight
which
they
possess
are
beyond
those
with
which
we
generally
associate
them
in
our
mind
seen
thus
trooping
homewards
in
all
their
many
moods
and
veins
whether
they
take
cervantes
serious
air
or
laugh
and
shake
in
rabelais
their
flight
combined
with
their
multitude
is
full
of
effects
their
widely
extended
bands
were
often
like
so
many
black
snowstorms
filling
a
great
part
of
the
sky
but
at
no
time
did
i
see
anything
resembling
leadership
the
many
wintered
crow
that
leads
the
clanging
rookery
home
is
a
lovely
line
on
no
other
occasion
could
i
make
out
that
rooks
obeyed
or
followed
any
recognised
leader
and
i
came
to
a
similar
negative
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
question
of
their
employment
of
sentinels
it
is
asserted
in
various
works
for
instance
in
the
latest
edition
of
chambers
encyclopedia
that
they
do
post
sentinels
i
will
give
two
instances
of
their
not
doing
so
as
i
concluded
and
my
experience
was
the
same
on
other
occasions
which
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
note
i
saw
a
number
of
rooks
blackening
a
heap
of
straw
by
a
stack
whilst
some
were
on
the
stack
itself
many
were
sitting
in
some
elms
near
about
but
they
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
acting
the
part
of
sentinels
when
i
tried
to
get
up
to
the
hedge
in
order
to
watch
the
rooks
at
the
stack
through
it
they
flew
off
a
good
deal
later
than
their
friends
in
the
trees
must
have
seen
me
and
not
till
i
was
quite
near
if
these
had
really
been
sentinels
they
should
have
warned
the
rest
either
the
instant
they
saw
me
or
at
any
rate
when
i
was
obviously
approaching
but
this
they
did
not
do
they
were
therefore
either
not
sentinels
or
inefficient
ones
the
second
case
however
is
more
conclusive
on
my
way
down
to
the
i
pass
a
number
of
rooks
feeding
in
a
field
and
not
far
from
the
road
they
are
all
more
or
less
together
there
are
no
outposts
though
of
course
there
is
of
necessity
an
outer
edge
to
the
flock
but
neither
on
the
hedge
or
in
any
of
the
trees
near
are
there
any
birds
to
be
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
however
and
a
very
considerable
way
off
a
few
are
sitting
in
some
trees
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
these
can
act
the
part
of
sentinels
at
such
a
distance
and
even
if
they
were
much
nearer
the
feeding
rooks
would
have
either
to
be
looking
at
them
to
see
when
they
flew
or
else
the
alarm
must
be
given
by
a
very
loud
warning
note
bearing
this
in
mind
i
alight
from
my
cycle
and
walk
along
the
road
the
rooks
without
any
dependence
on
sentinels
far
or
near
note
the
fact
bear
a
wary
eye
but
continue
feeding
i
then
stop
always
an
alarming
measure
with
birds
the
feeding
rooks
fly
off
to
a
safer
distance
the
ones
in
the
trees
remain
there
as
silent
as
ever
nor
is
there
any
special
note
uttered
by
any
one
bird
of
the
flock
nor
anything
else
whatever
to
suggest
that
any
particular
bird
or
birds
is
acting
the
part
of
sentinel
there
is
certainly
no
sentinel
in
this
case
and
in
matters
directly
affecting
their
safety
one
might
suppose
that
rooks
as
well
as
other
birds
and
beasts
would
act
in
a
uniform
manner
this
however
we
can
clearly
see
that
when
there
happen
to
be
trees
near
where
they
are
feeding
some
of
them
will
usually
and
quite
naturally
be
perched
in
them
and
average
human
observation
and
inference
may
have
done
the
rest
rooks
i
am
inclined
to
think
are
not
birds
that
give
their
conscience
into
keeping
each
one
of
them
is
his
own
sentinel

chapter
xi
watching
rooks
continued
continuing
my
journal
i
will
now
give
extracts
which
illustrate
principally
the
return
home
of
the
rooks
at
night
and
their
flying
forth
in
the
morning
those
two
aspects
of
their
daily
winter
life
which
are
the
most
full
perhaps
both
of
interest
and
of
poetry
this
afternoon
at
about
i
find
vast
numbers
of
rooks
gathered
together
on
a
wide
sweep
of
land
close
to
their
even
now
and
they
are
being
constantly
reinforced
they
must
amount
to
very
many
thousands
and
cover
several
acres
in
some
parts
standing
thickly
together
in
others
being
more
spread
out
there
is
an
extraordinary
babble
of
sound
a
chattering
note
and
the
flexible
croodling
one
being
conspicuous
combats
are
frequent
any
two
birds
seem
ready
to
enter
into
one
at
any
moment
and
they
commence
either
apparently
by
sudden
mutual
desire
or
else
by
one
bird
fixing
a
quarrel
on
another
which
he
does
by
walking
aggressively
up
to
him
and
daring
him
so
to
speak
in
fighting
they
stand
front
to
front
and
then
spring
up
at
each
other
like
pheasants
but
grappling
and
pecking
in
the
air
as
do
blackbirds
and
small
birds
generally
sometimes
one
bird
will
be
worsted
in
the
tussle
and
you
instantly
see
it
on
its
back
striking
up
with
claws
and
beak
at
the
other
who
now
bestrides
it
it
is
easier
to
see
this
result
than
to
be
sure
as
to
the
process
by
which
it
is
arrived
at
whether
for
instance
the
overmatched
bird
falls
on
its
back
or
purposely
throws
itself
into
that
position
so
as
to
strike
up
like
a
hawk
or
owl
i
think
that
this
last
may
sometimes
be
the
case
from
the
very
accustomed
way
in
which
rooks
fight
under
such
circumstances
but
no
doubt
it
would
only
be
done
as
a
last
resource
the
rooks
however
do
not
seem
vindictive
and
their
quarrels
though
spirited
are
usually
soon
over
they
may
end
either
by
the
weaker
or
the
less
bird
retiring
in
which
case
the
pursuit
is
not
very
sustained
or
vigorous
or
else
by
both
birds
after
a
short
and
not
very
rancorous
bout
pausing
appearing
to
wonder
what
they
could
have
been
thinking
about
and
so
walking
away
with
mutual
indifference
real
or
assumed
often
one
bird
will
decline
the
combat
and
in
this
case
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
is
not
molested
by
the
challenger
however
bullying
and
aggressive
this
one
manner
may
have
been
a
rook
coming
up
to
another
with
the
curious
sideway
swing
of
the
body
and
a
general
manner
which
seems
to
indicate
that
he
thinks
himself
the
stronger
of
the
two
looks
a
true
bully
one
rook
has
just
found
something
and
whilst
standing
with
it
in
his
bill
another
comes
forward
to
dispute
it
with
him
but
the
attack
is
and
seems
more
like
a
mere
matter
of
form
afterwards
when
the
same
bird
has
the
morsel
on
the
ground
in
good
position
a
second
rook
advances
upon
him
with
a
quick
sideway
hop
looking
cunning
sardonic
diabolic
and
much
for
which
words
seem
totally
wanting
but
this
attack
though
swift
and
vigorous
is
not
more
successful
than
the
former
one
the
lucky
rook
gets
off
with
his
booty
and
has
soon
swallowed
it
amongst
rooks
the
finding
of
anything
by
any
one
of
them
is
a
recognised
cause
of
attack
by
any
other
this
is
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
by
the
bird
attacked
and
if
he
holds
and
swallows
his
own
which
as
he
has
a
clear
advantage
he
generally
does
no
resentment
is
manifested
by
him
there
is
not
even
a
slight
coolness
after
the
incident
is
over
if
however
the
attack
should
be
successful
then
it
is
very
different
the
annoyance
is
too
great
for
the
robbed
bird
and
he
becomes
very
warm
indeed
he
makes
persistent
violent
rushes
after
the
robber
is
most
pertinacious
and
clearly
shows
that
kind
of
exasperation
which
would
be
felt
by
a
man
under
similar
circumstances
it
seems
not
so
much
his
own
loss
as
the
success
and
triumphant
bearing
of
the
other
bird
that
upsets
him
he
has
failed
where
he
ought
to
have
been
successful
and
of
this
he
seems
conscious
when
one
rook
makes
his
spring
into
the
air
at
another
this
one
will
sometimes
duck
down
instead
of
also
springing
the
springer
then
like
ambition
himself
and
falls
on
the
other
side
i
have
just
seen
this
the
rook
that
bobbed
seemed
to
have
scored
a
point
and
to
know
it
which
the
other
one
confessed
no
indescribably
a
rook
look
the
advantage
was
not
followed
up
by
the
successful
bird
but
the
combat
ceased
i
think
in
consequence
i
now
notice
a
hare
a
little
on
the
outside
of
the
phalanx
of
rooks
at
the
part
of
it
nearest
to
myself
all
at
once
he
makes
a
little
run
towards
them
as
if
charging
them
and
sits
down
making
one
of
their
first
line
and
almost
as
it
seems
touching
two
or
three
after
sitting
here
for
some
while
the
hare
makes
another
little
run
this
time
right
in
amongst
the
rooks
several
of
which
he
puts
up
as
though
on
purpose
each
of
the
birds
giving
a
little
jump
into
the
air
with
raised
wings
and
coming
down
again
he
then
sits
down
as
before
but
this
time
all
amongst
them
this
he
repeats
several
times
making
little
erratic
gallops
through
the
black
crowd
in
curves
to
one
side
and
another
and
appearing
to
enjoy
the
fun
of
causing
rook
after
rook
to
jump
up
from
the
ground
times
he
runs
right
at
a
rook
that
he
might
easily
have
avoided
and
sits
down
amongst
them
two
or
three
times
again
at
last
in
a
final
gallop
he
pierces
the
squadron
and
continues
on
over
the
land
this
certainly
appeared
to
me
to
show
a
sense
of
fun
if
not
of
humour
on
the
hare
part
and
as
with
a
few
noted
exceptions
it
is
the
rarest
thing
to
see
one
species
of
animal
take
any
notice
of
another
i
was
proportionately
interested
it
is
now
four
and
for
about
an
hour
the
great
assemblage
has
been
increased
by
a
perpetual
stream
of
rooks
that
sail
up
and
descend
into
it
with
joyous
wheels
and
sweeps
for
some
time
too
flocks
of
the
birds
have
been
flying
from
the
ground
into
trees
near
they
fly
by
relays
and
from
the
farthest
part
of
the
troop
that
is
to
say
from
that
part
which
is
farthest
distant
from
the
woods
where
they
are
to
roost
first
one
band
of
birds
and
then
another
rises
from
the
outer
extremity
flies
over
the
rest
ascending
gradually
and
wings
its
way
to
the
trees
by
these
successive
flights
the
assemblage
is
a
good
deal
shrunk
and
does
not
cover
nearly
so
much
ground
when
the
remainder
still
an
enormous
number
rise
like
a
black
snowdrift
whirled
by
the
wind
into
the
air
and
circle
in
a
dark
cloud
now
hardly
visible
in
the
darkening
sky
above
the
with
a
wonderful
babel
of
cries
and
noise
of
wings
at
this
deep
musical
sound
of
innumerable
crying
cawing
clamouring
throats
is
still
continuing
and
once
i
think
the
birds
rise
from
the
trees
into
which
they
have
sunk
and
circle
round
them
again
now
they
are
in
the
trees
once
more
but
the
lovely
cawing
murmur
the
hum
as
though
rooks
were
rooky
bees
still
goes
on
it
is
sinking
now
much
more
subdued
and
slumberous
deliciously
soothing
a
rook
lullaby
a
stern
winter
day
the
earth
lightly
but
bright
and
fine
in
the
morning
at
i
am
where
the
rooks
roost
a
plantation
of
larches
dark
gloomy
and
sombre
with
a
path
piercing
them
like
a
shaft
of
light
with
their
boughs
silvered
now
with
light
just
in
this
gloomy
patch
they
sleep
but
with
a
light
belt
of
smaller
firs
opposite
or
with
adjoining
woods
of
oak
and
beech
they
will
have
nothing
to
do
leaving
these
latter
to
the
illustration
a
winter
at
i
leave
the
woods
and
find
the
rooks
gathered
in
the
same
place
as
yesterday
but
in
far
less
numbers
shortly
a
large
band
flies
up
and
swoops
down
with
all
sorts
of
turns
and
twists
and
turns
right
over
in
the
air
a
striking
sight
the
air
full
of
the
rushing
sound
of
their
wings
a
a
black
descending
whirlwind
at
the
rooks
all
fly
from
the
ground
into
a
small
clump
of
near
great
numbers
of
other
ones
are
flying
up
and
settling
in
a
plantation
of
small
firs
fringing
another
part
of
the
field
quite
filling
it
the
snow
seems
to
drive
them
from
the
ground
their
conclave
must
be
held
in
the
trees
they
are
gathering
now
from
all
parts
filling
the
trees
round
about
the
ploughed
land
now
all
white
flying
in
flocks
about
them
then
descending
into
them
again
still
coming
and
coming
out
of
the
sunset
specks
growing
into
birds
the
stern
landscape
the
red
glow
of
the
sunset
and
the
black
labouring
pinions
against
it
make
a
fine
winter
scene
back
at
the
larches
and
only
just
in
time
to
stand
concealed
within
them
before
the
rooks
are
there
all
seem
coming
a
black
flying
multitude
they
have
reached
the
larches
and
fly
about
over
them
in
wide
sedate
circles
coming
in
relays
as
last
night
joyous
voices
innumerable
multitudes
a
torrent
of
wings
all
in
a
broad
rapid
streaming
flight
to
the
larches
they
sweep
dash
circle
and
eddy
over
them
black
flashes
in
the
deepening
gloom
they
sweep
into
them
and
the
snow
swept
by
their
wings
falls
in
a
drizzle
from
the
branches
joyous
excited
cries
chu
chac
chac
the
whole
dark
grove
is
a
cry
a
music
still
other
bands
they
burden
the
air
band
after
band
now
with
a
pause
between
each
they
fly
swiftly
and
steadily
up
at
a
not
much
greater
height
than
the
trees
not
descending
into
them
out
of
the
sky
a
longer
pause
followed
by
another
hurrying
band
and
now
the
moon
is
shining
through
the
larches
and
the
black
ceaseless
pinions
go
hurrying
across
its
face
groans
moans
shrieks
almost
amongst
the
larches
all
mingled
and
blending
but
sinking
now
a
marvellous
medley
a
wonderful
hoarse
harmony
here
are
shoutings
of
triumph
chatterings
of
joy
deep
trills
of
contentment
hoarse
yells
of
derision
deep
guttural
indignations
moanings
groanings
tauntings
remonstrances
clicks
squeaks
sobs
cachinnations
and
the
whole
a
most
musical
murmur
loud
but
a
murmur
a
wild
noisy
clamorous
murmur
but
sinking
now
softening
a
lullaby
never
heard
so
musical
a
discord
such
sweet
thunder
when
the
rooks
sweep
down
thus
into
their
they
frequently
do
so
with
a
peculiar
whirring
or
whizzing
noise
of
the
wings
but
although
this
sound
is
in
perfect
consonance
with
the
motion
which
it
accompanies
insomuch
that
one
has
to
use
the
same
words
to
describe
each
yet
it
does
not
seem
to
be
produced
by
it
at
least
it
bears
no
relation
to
the
height
from
which
the
birds
swoop
nor
as
would
seem
to
follow
from
this
with
the
impetus
of
the
descent
it
may
be
a
matter
of
impetus
but
to
me
it
has
often
seemed
more
as
though
the
sound
gave
the
idea
of
impetus
or
added
to
it
and
that
the
sweeps
were
sometimes
just
as
impetuous
or
even
more
so
when
made
without
it
as
i
observed
the
birds
flew
to
their
trees
at
a
very
moderate
height
not
very
much
indeed
above
the
trees
themselves
and
whilst
many
made
the
whizzing
sound
the
great
majority
swooped
down
without
it
it
seems
therefore
to
be
a
special
sound
produced
by
the
rooks
at
pleasure
and
always
accompanying
an
excited
frame
of
mind
first
one
bird
and
then
another
gets
excited
and
dashes
suddenly
down
with
the
whirring
or
whizzing
noise
so
that
as
the
sound
is
not
vocal
and
is
only
heard
upon
such
occasions
it
has
all
the
appearance
of
being
caused
by
the
quick
sudden
motions
of
the
wings
but
it
is
possible
that
some
particular
way
of
holding
the
of
the
wing
or
even
tail
is
required
to
produce
it
in
combination
with
the
general
movements
and
this
would
account
for
its
being
sometimes
heard
and
sometimes
not
heard
when
these
latter
are
identical
the
curious
burring
note
is
likewise
but
far
less
frequently
an
accompaniment
of
these
wild
excited
sweepings
and
this
is
most
often
the
case
when
they
are
from
a
considerable
height
here
again
the
note
bears
a
clear
relation
to
the
bird
mental
state
so
that
it
would
appear
that
the
degrees
of
pleasurable
excitement
can
not
be
estimated
by
the
motions
alone
the
burr
in
my
opinion
when
well
and
loudly
uttered
for
here
again
there
is
much
variety
marks
the
maximum
of
a
rook
content
at
any
rate
in
a
certain
direction
with
regard
to
the
above
however
i
am
now
no
longer
so
sure
when
the
rooks
descend
from
a
height
the
sound
made
is
often
most
remarkable
being
that
of
a
mighty
rushing
wind
filling
the
air
at
i
am
at
the
point
of
the
road
nearest
to
the
rookery
and
i
hear
the
sweet
jangle
musical
confusion
already
beginning
not
much
however
subdued
and
occasional
influenced
perhaps
by
the
heavy
morning
mist
that
hangs
over
trees
and
earth
after
a
time
i
walk
to
an
oak
just
outside
the
plantation
and
sit
listening
to
the
rising
hubbub
now
rising
now
falling
a
sad
morning
the
earth
lightly
raw
and
chill
but
not
so
frostily
bitingly
cold
as
yesterday
and
before
the
general
intonation
of
the
rook
voice
is
pleasing
and
musical
how
much
more
so
than
the
roar
of
an
as
the
door
is
flung
open
even
though
one
has
not
to
go
through
that
door
there
is
very
great
modulation
and
flexibility
more
expression
more
of
a
real
voice
than
other
birds
one
feels
that
beings
producing
such
sounds
must
be
intelligent
and
have
amiable
qualities
one
of
the
prettiest
babbles
in
nature
one
catches
qnook
at
intervals
the
single
sudden
squawk
or
continued
trumpeting
of
a
pheasant
breaks
abruptly
into
the
sea
of
sound
then
mingles
with
it
every
now
and
again
too
there
is
a
sudden
increase
of
sound
which
again
sinks
at
the
rooks
are
still
in
bed
but
a
pheasant
a
fine
cavalier
comes
running
towards
me
over
the
snow
he
makes
a
long
and
very
fast
run
for
some
fifty
yards
or
so
then
stops
and
draws
himself
bolt
upright
seeming
to
stand
on
more
than
upright
he
is
bent
back
to
look
like
a
soldier
but
to
be
graceful
and
elegant
standing
thus
he
seems
on
the
very
point
of
trumpeting
yet
does
not
and
then
runs
on
again
he
repeats
this
several
times
each
time
thinking
of
trumpeting
but
desisting
and
going
on
at
the
flight
out
commences
two
or
three
birds
are
a
little
in
front
none
very
prominently
so
and
others
are
catching
them
up
and
seem
just
on
the
point
of
passing
them
when
they
are
lost
to
me
in
the
mist
there
is
nothing
suggesting
a
leader
if
they
were
led
it
was
not
by
one
of
themselves
for
with
them
and
in
their
very
two
little
birds
were
flying
who
passed
with
them
out
of
sight
they
were
tits
i
think
and
in
another
flight
out
after
one
of
the
pauses
for
the
rooks
fly
out
by
relays
like
the
starlings
i
noticed
one
other
all
three
i
believe
being
there
are
quite
a
number
of
tits
in
the
plantation
and
woods
adjoining
but
why
just
three
should
leave
it
and
go
flying
with
the
rooks
through
the
mist
over
the
open
country
if
not
for
the
mere
joy
and
fun
of
the
thing
i
know
not
all
at
once
a
number
of
the
birds
turn
in
their
flight
and
swoop
back
with
a
great
rush
of
wings
to
the
plantation
afterwards
at
intervals
there
are
other
such
returns
little
bands
of
the
birds
seeming
to
say
let
go
back
to
bed
it
much
nicer
and
doing
so
this
too
is
exactly
what
the
starlings
do
the
birds
as
they
fly
are
all
vociferous
and
the
air
is
laden
with
a
pleasant
burden
of
the
rooks
talk
a
kind
of
chinese
at
the
principal
flight
is
over
but
still
there
is
a
stream
of
birds
issuing
out
and
most
of
these
are
now
going
down
on
to
the
land
all
at
once
these
that
is
to
say
all
the
rooks
on
the
ground
rise
and
fly
to
the
trees
the
birds
who
have
been
sitting
in
them
join
them
in
the
air
they
all
fly
about
together
over
the
trees
and
then
go
off
in
two
or
more
bodies
and
in
different
directions
there
has
been
no
sign
of
a
leader
or
of
leadership
in
any
of
the
flights
out
or
in
any
of
the
birds
actions
at
when
no
more
rooks
are
to
be
seen
either
flying
or
on
the
ground
i
walk
through
the
larches
and
put
up
a
good
many
birds
who
have
remained
sitting
in
them
instead
of
going
out
with
the
rest
i
then
walk
all
round
the
plantation
and
find
numbers
of
rooks
sitting
in
the
that
edge
it
on
one
side
though
the
numbers
seem
small
after
watching
the
innumerable
flights
out
they
may
yet
amount
to
some
hundreds
thus
some
small
bodies
of
birds
and
even
some
individuals
have
not
been
influenced
by
the
action
of
the
vast
majority
but
have
sat
still
whilst
the
rest
flew
forth
unless
indeed
all
of
them
have
first
flown
out
and
then
back
again
but
this
i
do
not
think
is
the
case
two
great
leading
principles
seem
to
govern
all
the
actions
of
rooks
independence
and
interdependence
all
are
influenced
by
all
yet
all
can
on
any
and
every
occasion
withstand
that
influence
and
think
and
act
for
themselves
sometimes
the
sweepsback
of
the
birds
into
the
trees
are
very
curious
seeming
to
indicate
some
unknown
force
at
work
there
is
a
sort
of
commotion
a
turmoil
of
some
sort
causing
a
cessation
of
the
regular
orderly
flight
the
voice
varies
there
is
a
rush
of
wings
and
out
of
this
trouble
as
it
were
the
backward
swoop
is
born
then
the
wavering
stream
or
rather
a
certain
wavering
eddy
in
it
flies
on
and
again
the
voice
becomes
the
musical
a
better
rendering
than
which
characterises
the
flight
out
it
is
as
though
a
sudden
surge
of
thought
said
and
swept
some
back
but
a
deeper
stronger
surge
said
and
on
the
greater
number
streamed
again
the
stream
of
flight
will
sometimes
be
interrupted
by
a
sort
of
sweeping
or
drifting
together
of
a
number
of
the
birds
making
an
eddy
in
it
as
it
were
an
interruption
and
perturbation
in
the
current
difficult
to
describe
and
over
before
one
can
fix
the
proper
words
to
it
but
indicating
some
sort
of
emotion
in
the
birds
a
rush
of
feeling
of
some
kind
something
tiresome
to
note
but
which
ought
to
be
noted
once
too
i
have
seen
a
single
rook
flying
straight
back
against
the
general
current
of
the
stream
meeting
and
passing
all
the
rest
on
his
way
to
the
trees
seeming
the
very
emblem
of
a
fixed
intent
these
curious
pausing
and
hesitating
movements
in
which
an
idea
that
seems
at
first
vague
becomes
all
at
once
definite
seem
to
me
to
have
their
origin
in
what
may
be
termed
collective
thinking
for
this
gives
a
better
idea
of
the
appearance
of
the
thing
than
does
the
term
though
that
may
more
correctly
indicate
the
process
the
birds
do
not
appear
to
be
influenced
by
the
actions
the
external
signs
of
thought
of
each
other
but
numbers
of
them
seem
similarly
influenced
at
or
about
the
same
moment
of
time
in
fact
they
often
act
as
though
an
actual
wind
had
swept
them
in
this
or
that
direction
when
this
can
not
have
been
the
case
i
hasten
to
add
a
hard
black
frost
bitterly
bitingly
cold
at
i
steal
into
the
dark
plantation
and
silently
take
my
place
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
tall
sighing
trees
softly
as
i
try
to
move
i
disturb
some
of
the
sleeping
birds
who
make
heavy
plunges
amongst
the
trees
or
beat
about
for
a
little
through
palpable
obscure
above
them
but
leaning
against
the
trunk
i
am
now
and
soon
they
settle
down
again
though
some
nervous
inquiry
continues
a
little
breaking
out
first
here
and
then
there
around
where
i
sit
i
soon
notice
however
that
these
outbursts
have
no
relation
to
my
whereabouts
but
take
place
over
the
whole
plantation
and
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
late
disturbance
which
is
now
evidently
forgotten
the
night
in
fact
is
passing
and
the
rooks
are
beginning
to
be
rooks
such
noises
in
the
utter
darkness
amidst
the
firs
sound
ghostly
and
may
perhaps
have
given
rise
to
the
idea
of
the
in
the
winter
it
must
be
remembered
it
is
night
practically
for
some
time
after
the
peasantry
of
any
country
are
up
and
about
nor
can
i
conceive
of
any
sounds
more
calculated
to
give
rise
to
superstitious
ideas
than
some
of
those
i
hear
about
me
in
the
real
night
too
a
belated
peasant
might
easily
get
a
note
or
two
from
some
awakening
rook
and
both
by
virtue
of
time
and
place
and
the
actual
quality
of
the
sound
as
i
can
testify
it
would
sound
very
different
to
what
he
was
accustomed
to
in
the
daytime
it
is
probable
that
in
a
country
where
ravens
were
known
and
inspired
those
superstitious
feelings
which
they
always
have
inspired
such
sounds
issuing
out
of
the
darkness
would
be
ascribed
to
them
rather
than
to
the
homely
rook
and
here
we
should
have
the
a
bird
met
with
in
fiction
but
apparently
nowhere
else
possibly
however
the
raven
itself
may
sometimes
utter
its
boding
croak
through
the
darkness
and
ravens
have
been
and
in
some
parts
still
are
numerous
gradually
the
plantation
becomes
quite
a
wonderful
study
of
sounds
there
being
an
extraordinary
variety
and
some
of
them
most
remarkable
one
that
seems
deep
down
in
the
throat
suggests
castanets
being
played
there
but
castanets
of
a
very
liquid
kind
if
such
there
could
be
but
if
not
it
gives
the
idea
this
curious
sound
is
only
uttered
occasionally
by
some
particular
rook
and
it
recalls
perhaps
is
the
burring
note
that
i
have
heard
under
such
different
circumstances
if
so
it
can
only
be
as
a
recollection
that
the
bird
utters
it
i
have
not
the
space
to
reason
this
but
assuming
it
to
be
so
may
we
not
see
here
one
of
the
alleys
leading
up
to
language
a
certain
sound
is
uttered
during
the
doing
of
a
certain
thing
it
becomes
associated
in
the
mind
with
that
thing
with
the
doing
of
it
and
with
the
state
of
mind
under
the
influence
of
which
it
is
done
at
first
perhaps
unconsciously
then
consciously
it
is
uttered
when
such
action
is
recalled
and
the
utterance
recalls
it
also
to
the
mind
of
whoever
hears
here
then
is
a
certain
sound
conveying
a
certain
idea
or
ideas
as
first
a
particular
kind
of
joyous
flight
then
something
as
joyous
as
such
flight
and
so
joy
and
lastly
the
actual
joyous
flying
the
root
therefore
of
the
verb
to
fly
joyously
and
so
to
fly
darwin
supposes
language
to
owe
its
origin
the
imitation
and
modification
of
various
natural
sounds
the
voices
of
other
animals
and
man
own
instinctive
cries
aided
by
signs
and
gestures
to
repeat
a
certain
sound
that
had
been
at
first
the
mere
mechanical
adjunct
of
a
certain
act
or
state
when
one
recalled
that
act
or
state
would
be
as
it
seems
to
me
an
extremely
early
perhaps
the
earliest
step
passing
imperceptibly
from
feeling
into
thought
and
leading
on
to
imitation
such
speculations
may
be
permitted
one
in
a
dark
surrounded
by
rooks
and
waiting
for
the
morning
one
thing
however
i
record
as
a
fact
which
appears
to
me
somewhat
curious
though
the
plantation
is
continuous
without
any
break
other
than
the
narrow
path
that
runs
through
its
centre
and
though
it
is
simply
crowded
with
rooks
every
tree
holding
a
great
many
yet
i
notice
that
an
outbreak
of
sound
in
any
particular
part
of
it
does
not
spread
over
the
whole
as
one
might
have
supposed
that
it
would
but
dies
gradually
out
as
it
radiates
from
the
point
where
it
arose
thus
there
are
zones
of
sound
isolated
from
each
other
by
intervening
areas
of
silence
just
at
this
moment
after
i
have
sat
for
some
time
silent
and
all
alarm
has
subsided
there
is
a
great
clamorous
outburst
some
little
way
off
it
must
have
some
special
cause
which
i
can
not
divine
but
this
commotion
does
not
any
more
than
the
lesser
ones
spread
itself
through
the
packed
community
but
is
strictly
isolated
how
strange
this
seems
a
parliament
though
i
heard
no
nonsense
talked
of
lively
eminently
gregarious
birds
all
of
which
are
noisy
at
one
time
or
another
and
from
the
thick
of
them
a
storm
of
clamour
bursts
would
not
one
think
that
the
birds
sitting
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
stormers
would
storm
too
and
so
it
on
why
should
there
be
a
periphery
and
what
should
limit
the
chorus
except
the
bound
of
the
plantation
itself
do
crowds
shout
in
patches
that
the
clamour
should
cease
after
a
time
is
of
course
natural
but
why
though
it
died
along
the
road
by
which
it
travelled
should
it
not
keep
travelling
on
through
all
the
black
serried
ranks
if
rooks
were
influenced
only
by
the
outward
manifestations
of
each
other
emotions
one
might
surely
expect
this
but
now
if
they
were
influenced
more
by
the
thought
itself
rapidly
transmitted
from
one
to
another
of
them
then
whenever
this
factor
ceased
for
whatever
reason
to
act
the
birds
beyond
the
limits
of
its
action
might
be
unaffected
by
the
cries
of
those
who
had
felt
its
influence
for
they
would
have
been
accustomed
to
look
for
a
sign
from
within
and
not
from
without
they
might
then
hear
on
some
occasions
without
being
though
on
other
occasions
they
might
to
join
it
may
be
difficult
to
realise
such
a
psychical
state
but
that
does
not
of
itself
make
the
state
impossible
its
possibility
would
depend
upon
the
reality
or
not
of
collective
thinking
or
and
observation
is
or
should
be
our
only
means
of
deciding
as
to
this
as
light
struggles
out
of
the
darkness
the
silence
is
broken
more
and
more
frequently
at
some
point
or
other
of
the
plantation
so
that
the
sound
is
disseminated
over
a
larger
and
larger
space
till
for
some
little
while
before
the
flight
the
whole
rookery
seems
to
be
talking
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
reality
however
there
is
a
constant
cessation
and
renewal
on
the
part
of
each
individual
bird
at
the
sounds
take
a
deeper
and
more
emphatic
tone
there
is
more
solemnity
more
meaning
and
the
meaning
grows
plainer
and
plainer
as
the
asseveration
becomes
more
and
more
emphatic
that
is
yes
is
is
really
positively
is
is
is
is
the
morning
at
there
is
the
light
joyous
besides
which
one
catches
if
one
has
a
good
ear
chook
hook
took
chuck
chuck
chuck
chuck
chuck
chuck
polyglot
polyglot
then
there
is
a
question
a
serious
and
solemnly
propounded
question
the
answer
from
another
rook
is
immediate
and
undoubted
there
are
sounds
which
just
miss
being
articulate
and
just
evade
efforts
to
write
them
down
it
is
significant
that
i
have
to
use
the
word
to
describe
the
rook
utterances
it
is
the
one
word
another
would
sound
forced
and
strained
throughout
the
babel
there
is
a
tendency
for
it
to
sink
and
rise
in
sudden
accentuations
and
diminishments
now
there
is
a
diminishment
and
a
bird
in
the
tree
next
to
mine
gives
a
sleepy
stretch
out
of
one
wing
which
has
all
the
appearance
of
a
yawn
but
i
see
no
other
bird
yawning
nor
do
i
notice
any
toilette
any
preening
of
the
feathers
now
at
close
on
the
flight
out
is
preceded
by
a
flight
of
the
birds
inside
the
plantation
from
one
tree
to
another
and
this
passes
gradually
into
the
full
just
above
the
trees
now
they
pass
in
endless
flakes
of
a
black
and
living
snowstorm
their
flight
is
swift
hurrying
joyous
they
flap
but
there
are
often
long
sweeps
on
outspread
wings
between
the
flaps
and
ever
as
they
fly
they
greet
the
cold
stern
morning
with
their
of
nearly
a
month
later
a
smaller
but
still
numerous
body
of
the
birds
had
chosen
a
new
a
clump
of
scotch
firs
on
a
lonely
heath
which
had
stood
vacant
all
the
winter
a
point
interesting
in
itself
but
which
for
the
old
reason
i
am
unable
to
discuss
i
got
to
the
plantation
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
and
resolved
to
wait
there
in
order
to
see
fly
into
it
in
the
evening
not
many
came
but
at
six
i
saw
what
i
thought
was
a
large
band
of
them
fly
into
an
which
i
had
noticed
just
outside
the
plantation
where
they
remained
for
a
minute
or
two
they
then
flew
on
to
the
plantation
sweeping
over
it
once
or
twice
before
settling
and
i
saw
that
they
were
rooks
as
will
be
seen
from
this
they
had
hitherto
been
silent
when
they
had
settled
in
the
trees
there
was
some
talking
but
strangely
little
i
thought
for
rooks
and
very
soon
afterwards
there
was
hardly
a
sound
they
remained
thus
for
some
little
time
all
at
once
with
extraordinary
suddenness
with
a
sound
of
wings
so
compact
and
instantaneous
that
it
was
almost
like
the
report
of
a
gun
the
whole
troop
burst
suddenly
out
of
the
trees
which
were
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
plantation
flew
a
little
way
over
the
heath
i
caught
them
against
the
fading
red
of
the
sky
wheeled
round
returned
and
shot
into
them
again
there
was
a
little
cawing
as
they
got
back
but
this
soon
sank
and
again
there
was
silence
then
in
a
moment
there
was
the
same
sudden
rush
of
wings
and
the
whole
black
cloud
shot
like
one
bird
into
the
open
sky
wheeled
again
and
shot
back
as
before
this
occurred
nine
times
in
succession
at
intervals
of
not
longer
i
should
think
than
three
or
four
minutes
in
the
later
rushes
the
birds
circled
several
times
flying
out
again
each
time
over
the
moor
before
resettling
in
the
trees
after
the
last
time
they
settled
in
a
different
part
of
the
plantation
immediately
before
two
of
the
rushes
out
i
heard
a
loud
in
rather
a
tone
from
a
single
rook
which
seemed
to
be
the
signal
for
the
exodus
whilst
almost
immediately
afterwards
there
was
another
single
note
of
quite
a
different
character
deeper
and
more
guttural
from
either
the
same
or
another
bird
still
in
the
trees
which
seemed
to
call
the
rest
back
again
a
well
understood
indeed
would
be
the
easiest
way
of
accounting
for
these
sudden
and
extraordinarily
simultaneous
flights
and
returns
but
it
was
only
twice
out
of
the
nine
times
that
this
explanation
seemed
tenable
on
other
occasions
the
caw
at
starting
seemed
only
one
of
many
or
did
not
correspond
so
exactly
in
point
of
time
with
the
sudden
flight
out
as
the
theory
seemed
to
require
whilst
the
deep
which
seemed
to
be
made
by
one
particular
rook
who
always
stayed
behind
and
which
i
had
at
first
thought
called
the
others
back
would
be
heard
directly
after
they
had
flown
as
well
as
after
they
had
returned
several
times
too
the
black
cloud
and
of
wings
seemed
to
burst
out
of
silence
itself
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
was
not
the
explanation
all
i
can
say
is
that
from
what
cause
or
actuated
by
what
impulse
i
know
not
some
fifty
to
a
hundred
rooks
shot
as
though
they
shared
one
soul
nine
times
in
succession
from
those
dark
pines
circled
a
little
over
the
dusky
moor
and
then
shot
back
into
them
again
no
one
except
myself
was
near
it
was
one
of
those
very
lonely
places
where
at
almost
any
time
one
can
count
upon
seeing
no
one
and
altogether
it
struck
me
as
an
extraordinary
phenomenon
once
more
the
old
greek
idea
of
the
φημη
a
sudden
thought
sweeping
through
a
crowd
as
a
wind
sweeps
through
a
grove
of
trees
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
only
view
which
met
the
facts
but
what
then
is
the
φημη
and
whence
or
why
the
impulse
all
this
time
i
should
say
though
quite
near
i
was
perfectly
concealed
standing
against
a
tall
around
the
trunk
of
which
i
had
helped
to
make
a
wigwam
already
partly
formed
of
some
of
its
own
fallen
and
bending
branches
this
with
the
gloom
of
the
plantation
itself
and
the
falling
night
was
a
perfect
concealment
even
at
a
foot
pace
as
will
shortly
appear
it
was
just
after
the
last
return
of
the
birds
that
looking
up
i
saw
what
i
at
first
supposed
was
they
but
soon
found
to
be
another
and
a
very
much
more
numerous
band
of
rooks
who
as
they
came
up
were
joined
by
the
other
ones
in
the
air
now
for
the
first
time
for
the
cloud
came
up
in
silence
and
since
the
last
flight
out
there
had
been
silence
in
the
plantation
too
there
was
a
tremendous
clamour
of
voices
filling
the
whole
place
and
then
a
black
whirling
snowstorm
of
rooks
began
to
shoot
whirr
and
whizz
about
over
into
through
and
amongst
the
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
the
rapidity
with
which
they
shot
about
their
hurtlings
their
sweeps
and
swoops
their
quick
smooth
turns
and
gliding
avoiding
by
miracle
each
other
and
the
trunks
of
trees
was
most
extraordinary
whilst
the
whishing
noise
of
their
wings
through
the
air
was
almost
frightening
the
plantation
seemed
to
be
a
huge
disturbed
with
great
black
bees
dashing
angrily
about
it
it
was
a
snowstorm
with
the
flakes
gone
mad
but
black
a
black
living
and
it
produced
in
me
a
feeling
of
excitement
a
peculiar
almost
a
new
sensation
analogous
perhaps
to
what
the
birds
themselves
were
feeling
what
struck
me
and
made
it
more
interesting
was
that
it
was
a
special
exhibition
a
thing
something
indulged
in
by
the
birds
with
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
the
indulgence
something
appertaining
to
the
the
emanating
from
and
requiring
a
particular
psychical
state
this
is
by
far
the
finest
display
of
the
kind
i
have
yet
seen
and
i
was
in
the
very
midst
of
it
considering
the
number
of
birds
there
must
i
think
have
been
several
hundreds
the
speed
at
which
they
dashed
about
and
the
smallness
of
the
space
in
which
so
many
were
moving
with
such
violence
and
so
erratically
it
seems
wonderful
that
they
never
came
into
collision
either
with
one
another
or
the
trunks
or
branches
of
the
in
the
plantation
when
i
came
into
it
two
dead
rooks
were
lying
and
i
had
also
picked
up
a
dead
one
in
the
larger
the
keeper
said
it
had
been
out
which
was
vague
and
then
more
definitely
that
rooks
sometimes
died
of
old
age
it
seems
not
impossible
or
even
improbable
that
in
these
violent
whizzings
of
a
great
number
of
rooks
together
amongst
closely
growing
trees
and
in
the
gloom
of
evening
fading
slowly
into
night
accidents
may
sometimes
occur
the
rooks
i
should
say
in
their
violent
whizzing
darts
and
dashes
shot
down
sometimes
to
about
half
the
height
of
the
trees
and
were
in
general
right
in
amongst
them
this
wonderful
scene
of
bird
excitement
lasted
i
should
think
about
ten
minutes
in
full
action
but
grew
fainter
as
the
trees
became
more
and
more
packed
with
birds
till
at
length
all
were
settled
every
tree
held
several
on
two
slender
ones
not
pines
but
birches
just
in
front
of
me
and
but
a
step
or
two
off
there
must
have
been
more
than
twenty
the
noise
and
clamour
during
the
whole
time
was
tremendous
it
is
not
always
that
rooks
dash
thus
madly
to
rest
here
on
the
very
next
evening
and
at
the
same
place
is
another
type
of
the
a
little
after
a
hooded
crow
flies
into
the
clump
of
pines
whether
it
stays
there
for
the
night
with
the
rooks
i
can
not
tell
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
improbable
i
have
seen
single
birds
of
the
former
species
flying
amidst
large
bands
of
the
latter
and
they
are
constantly
together
in
the
fields
where
they
behave
in
regard
to
each
other
very
much
as
though
they
were
of
the
same
species
at
which
is
later
than
the
first
batch
of
rooks
came
yesterday
five
birds
fly
over
the
plantation
but
do
not
go
down
into
it
at
a
large
united
flock
of
perhaps
six
or
seven
hundred
fly
up
from
over
the
ploughed
land
skirting
the
moor
they
utter
the
note
characteristic
of
the
homeward
flight
but
quietly
there
is
very
little
noise
just
before
reaching
the
plantation
they
make
a
sort
of
circling
eddy
in
the
air
becoming
as
it
were
two
streams
that
drift
through
each
other
then
sail
on
together
and
circle
some
three
or
four
times
exactly
over
it
before
descending
into
its
midst
this
they
do
without
any
of
the
excited
sweeping
about
of
yesterday
and
though
of
course
the
voice
of
so
many
birds
is
considerable
yet
comparatively
it
is
very
subdued
and
in
a
very
short
time
about
five
minutes
they
all
seem
settled
before
long
however
some
of
them
but
quite
an
inconsiderable
number
rise
and
fly
about
over
the
trees
again
but
soon
resettle
and
there
is
now
a
deepening
silence
no
one
could
imagine
that
that
little
lonely
clump
of
trees
held
all
that
great
army
of
birds
all
has
been
wonderfully
decorous
there
was
something
majestic
in
the
way
the
rooks
flew
up
yet
their
flight
round
over
the
trees
before
sinking
like
night
and
with
the
night
upon
them
was
a
fine
sombre
scene
the
thickening
light
thickens
and
the
crow
the
silent
moor
the
gloomy
trees
and
above
them
in
the
dusky
air
that
inky
cloud
of
life
it
was
gloomy
the
effect
saddening
yet
with
the
joy
of
nature
sadness
the
spirit
of
macbeth
was
in
it
on
this
blasted
heath
things
of
day
begin
to
droop
and
drowse
whilst
night
black
agents
to
their
prey
do
rouse
but
they
sank
peacefully
down
and
all
of
evil
seemed
to
go
with
their
sweet
joyous
innocent
and
voices
here
is
one
last
picture
and
i
would
point
out
that
on
all
these
three
occasions
when
the
rooks
slept
in
changed
quarters
at
a
later
time
of
the
year
the
way
in
which
they
approached
or
entered
the
trees
and
the
height
at
which
they
flew
varied
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
from
what
it
had
been
before
at
a
small
band
of
rooks
comes
flapping
along
in
the
usual
way
and
enters
the
plantation
some
five
minutes
afterwards
a
very
large
number
sail
up
flying
at
a
great
height
and
gather
like
a
above
it
they
hang
over
it
then
drift
circling
a
little
descending
gradually
on
outspread
wings
till
when
at
a
moderate
height
above
the
they
begin
to
shoot
down
into
them
in
the
rapid
whizzing
manner
before
described
but
they
do
not
all
do
this
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
slow
and
gradual
in
its
first
stages
almost
a
solemn
entry
and
the
shooting
down
itself
becomes
gradually
less
rapid
how
grand
is
this
to
witness
it
is
a
living
discharging
its
black
winged
rain
a
simile
indeed
which
can
hardly
fail
to
suggest
itself
so
apparent
is
the
resemblance
at
a
distance
i
think
the
two
might
be
really
confounded
the
gradual
sinking
of
the
birds
by
fine
gradations
and
almost
imperceptibly
from
their
vast
height
is
more
like
an
atmospheric
than
an
organic
phenomenon
the
effect
is
heightened
by
the
loneliness
and
utter
silence
by
the
deepening
shadows
night
sinks
as
they
sink
but
the
moon
is
now
becoming
luminous
and
the
swish
and
of
peewits
is
about
one
on
one
way
back
over
the
heath
i
will
conclude
this
fragment
of
my
rook
diary
by
giving
a
list
of
some
of
the
distinct
notes
or
sounds
which
i
have
at
different
times
heard
the
birds
utter
it
is
but
a
small
page
out
of
their
vocabulary
but
it
may
perhaps
serve
to
draw
attention
to
the
great
powers
of
modulation
and
inflexion
which
these
birds
possess
i
must
confess
that
the
way
in
which
the
voice
of
the
rook
is
usually
spoken
of
makes
me
wonder
to
me
it
has
often
seemed
as
though
these
birds
were
really
in
process
of
evolving
a
language
in
only
a
few
cases
however
have
i
been
able
or
have
i
thought
myself
able
to
connect
a
note
with
any
particular
act
or
state
of
mind
here
is

watching
blackbirds
nightingales
etc
birds
are
never
more
charming
to
watch
than
when
they
are
building
their
nests
and
of
all
our
british
few
perhaps
build
more
charmingly
than
the
blackbird
it
is
the
hen
alone
that
collects
and
shapes
the
materials
but
the
male
bird
accompanies
her
in
every
excursion
either
to
or
from
the
nest
when
she
is
busied
in
its
construction
he
sits
in
a
tree
or
a
bush
near
by
and
on
her
leaving
it
for
fresh
leaves
or
moss
follows
her
in
a
series
of
flights
from
tree
to
tree
and
finally
down
on
to
the
ground
where
the
two
hop
about
closely
in
each
other
company
it
is
seldom
that
the
hen
flies
at
once
to
where
she
means
to
collect
her
materials
though
time
after
time
it
may
be
at
the
same
place
usually
she
flies
past
the
tree
all
beautiful
in
spring
and
early
morning
where
the
cock
sits
and
perches
in
another
at
some
little
distance
beyond
it
there
you
may
lose
sight
of
her
but
as
soon
as
you
see
her
handsome
mate
leave
his
bower
and
fly
to
hers
you
know
that
she
has
flown
on
and
is
now
perched
somewhere
else
thus
you
may
see
them
glancing
through
the
greenwood
she
usually
leading
but
sometimes
each
alternately
passing
the
other
coming
to
the
collecting
ground
for
there
is
usually
some
spot
more
liked
by
the
birds
than
any
other
the
hen
flies
down
and
begins
to
hop
about
making
at
intervals
little
dives
forward
with
her
bill
till
she
has
collected
some
moss
dry
grass
or
quite
a
little
bundle
of
dead
brown
leaves
the
male
bird
follows
her
all
about
hopping
where
she
hops
prying
where
she
pries
and
seeming
to
make
a
point
of
doing
all
that
she
does
except
actually
collect
material
for
the
nest
and
this
in
my
experience
he
never
does
do
then
the
one
laden
the
other
they
both
fly
back
in
just
the
same
way
and
the
cock
will
sit
again
often
in
the
same
tree
whilst
the
hen
adds
her
store
to
the
growing
bulk
of
the
nest
i
have
watched
a
pair
make
excursions
to
and
from
the
nest
between
five
and
eight
in
the
morning
by
eight
or
nine
the
building
would
cease
nor
would
it
be
commenced
again
during
the
rest
of
the
day
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
this
by
coming
a
few
times
at
intervals
anything
lovelier
than
the
picture
presented
by
the
two
birds
thus
busied
together
in
the
early
dewy
morning
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
it
would
arouse
the
enthusiasm
of
all
except
very
dull
people
and
is
even
a
prettier
thing
to
see
i
think
than
when
both
male
and
female
work
jointly
in
the
latter
case
the
straightforward
business
element
predominates
but
here
the
attendance
of
the
male
bird
upon
the
female
and
his
evident
pleasure
in
such
attendance
his
anxious
interest
in
what
she
is
doing
and
joy
in
seeing
her
do
it
throws
a
more
romantic
element
into
the
picture
it
is
that
which
makes
me
extend
the
word
busy
to
both
the
birds
for
the
cock
is
as
busy
in
escorting
and
observing
the
hen
as
she
is
in
collecting
the
materials
for
and
building
the
nest
whilst
that
she
loves
him
and
is
cheered
by
his
society
his
presence
making
the
labour
she
delights
in
still
more
a
joy
is
also
apparent
these
are
sweet
and
lovely
things
to
see
and
the
joy
of
them
is
the
greater
that
the
emotions
concerned
are
so
direct
and
simple
without
those
windings
and
ambiguities
those
and
which
with
us
lead
direct
to
grey
hairs
and
novels
not
by
scott
or
jane
austen
here
are
no
troublesome
entanglements
no
tiresome
perplexities
no
conscientious
sacrificings
of
the
best
beloved
to
every
other
possible
person
and
consideration
all
is
sweet
simplicity
and
giving
up
to
not
giving
up
these
blackbirds
love
each
other
and
carry
it
through
they
do
not
think
of
twenty
other
blackbirds
and
fail
or
come
in
at
the
end
as
in
the
novels
nor
are
they
bothered
with
questions
it
is
refreshing
most
refreshing
to
see
them
like
a
sparkle
of
gilbert
after
some
very
serious
dulness
roughly
speaking
there
are
three
stages
in
the
building
of
a
blackbird
nest
the
first
or
foundation
stage
consists
of
moss
sticks
and
leaves
the
second
is
the
mud
stage
and
the
third
that
of
dry
grass
and
fibre
with
which
the
interior
is
finally
lined
the
nest
of
the
blackbird
differs
in
this
respect
from
that
of
the
thrush
the
latter
bird
as
is
well
known
lays
its
eggs
in
a
smooth
plastered
cup
formed
not
of
mud
as
one
would
think
but
of
rotten
wood
and
the
blackbird
after
having
collected
all
the
moss
and
leaves
that
it
deems
necessary
and
made
therewith
the
mass
and
bulk
of
the
nest
resorts
to
some
little
ditch
or
sluggish
stream
and
trowels
up
from
its
margin
mud
indeed
but
not
mud
alone
for
there
is
amidst
it
generally
if
not
always
a
certain
proportion
of
the
fibrous
roots
or
rootlets
of
aquatic
plants
of
these
the
bird
can
take
a
firm
hold
with
its
bill
and
as
the
mud
adheres
to
the
fibrous
network
it
is
enabled
to
carry
a
considerable
quantity
of
it
at
a
time
though
a
greater
or
less
amount
often
falls
off
during
the
passage
it
is
in
this
circumstance
as
i
believe
that
one
can
read
the
origin
of
the
extraordinary
habit
as
darwin
calls
it
of
a
bird
plastering
the
inside
of
its
nest
with
mud
it
is
the
thrush
to
which
he
alludes
but
the
description
applies
equally
and
in
respect
of
the
material
employed
still
more
accurately
to
the
blackbird
at
a
certain
point
in
its
construction
the
nest
of
the
latter
would
be
mistaken
by
anyone
without
previous
experience
for
that
of
a
thrush
the
cup
being
as
deep
and
perfect
in
form
and
the
workmanship
not
noticeably
inferior
it
is
however
of
a
darker
colour
black
or
approaching
to
black
though
this
may
vary
according
to
locality
over
the
whole
surface
are
seen
the
scorings
of
the
bird
beak
which
seems
to
have
been
used
as
a
trowel
but
now
if
the
nest
had
been
examined
a
day
or
two
before
its
interior
and
especially
the
bottom
of
it
would
have
been
found
to
be
composed
of
a
dank
moist
mass
of
vegetation
largely
consisting
of
small
both
the
green
part
and
the
roots
to
the
many
fibres
of
which
latter
a
quantity
of
mud
was
adhering
here
then
we
read
the
whole
story
fibrous
material
was
needed
on
general
principles
by
the
female
blackbird
and
she
found
it
in
the
spreading
network
of
rootlets
belonging
to
plants
that
grew
in
little
rills
and
ditches
near
about
her
bosky
brakes
but
to
this
mud
clung
and
in
consequence
there
came
to
be
a
good
deal
of
the
latter
in
the
cup
of
the
nest
something
must
be
done
with
it
she
began
to
daub
and
press
it
and
as
she
became
gradually
more
and
more
a
plasterer
mud
seemed
more
and
more
the
proper
sort
of
material
to
use
till
at
last
she
sought
it
for
itself
alone
utilising
the
fibres
which
bound
it
together
and
which
had
at
first
been
what
alone
she
sought
as
a
means
of
conveying
it
but
when
the
mud
thus
brought
had
been
thoroughly
smoothed
and
plastered
so
that
the
nest
seemed
perfect
and
a
thing
complete
like
the
thrush
there
would
still
be
something
more
to
be
done
for
she
our
hen
blackbird
had
always
been
accustomed
to
work
in
stages
and
the
final
or
stage
had
not
yet
been
entered
upon
therefore
she
would
cover
up
and
entirely
conceal
all
her
fine
so
that
no
one
seeing
the
finished
nest
would
imagine
that
it
existed
in
any
part
of
it
but
will
she
always
do
this
i
can
not
think
it
for
she
is
a
bird
of
sprightly
intelligence
and
i
believe
that
like
the
thrush
she
will
some
day
find
out
that
the
cup
of
mud
does
quite
well
enough
to
lay
her
eggs
in
and
that
the
further
labour
of
thatching
it
with
grass
can
be
very
well
dispensed
with
any
saving
of
time
or
of
labour
must
be
of
advantage
to
a
species
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
those
birds
who
thatched
their
nests
more
thinly
would
be
enabled
to
lay
their
eggs
sooner
and
thus
rear
more
offspring
in
this
way
as
well
as
on
the
least
action
principle
and
the
exercise
of
ordinary
intelligence
the
last
stage
of
lining
the
cup
with
grass
may
finally
cease
it
has
ceased
with
the
thrush
but
with
the
thrush
there
has
been
a
still
further
process
of
change
for
it
no
longer
plasters
its
nest
with
mud
but
with
decaying
wood
and
with
assuming
the
ancestors
of
the
bird
to
have
once
used
mud
and
lined
the
interior
as
does
the
blackbird
there
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
any
great
difficulty
in
explaining
this
change
the
blackbirds
that
i
watched
building
their
nest
always
when
the
proper
period
arrived
flew
to
a
certain
part
of
a
little
muddy
dyke
it
is
in
a
land
of
dykes
that
i
reside
some
little
way
from
the
plantation
in
which
the
nest
was
situated
and
there
lying
flat
behind
tufts
and
tussocks
of
reeds
and
grass
i
watched
them
take
their
mud
as
i
have
described
the
female
that
is
to
say
but
a
husband
much
interested
in
seeing
a
baby
carried
would
deserve
half
the
credit
of
carrying
it
now
much
nearer
probably
than
this
dyke
was
some
decayed
tree
or
whilst
over
the
fields
which
it
intersected
and
which
adjoined
the
plantation
cows
or
oxen
sometimes
grazed
here
again
a
change
in
the
working
material
might
prove
of
advantage
and
when
once
a
bird
had
become
a
plasterer
intelligence
and
also
haste
might
lead
it
to
use
whatever
came
first
to
hand
bees
will
carry
oatmeal
instead
of
pollen
if
the
former
be
put
in
their
way
and
birds
may
be
credited
with
equal
adaptability
after
watching
blackbirds
building
and
examining
the
nest
in
its
various
stages
of
construction
i
think
it
much
more
likely
that
the
thrush
has
passed
through
and
then
discarded
a
final
stage
of
thatching
the
nest
than
that
it
has
stopped
short
at
the
stage
of
plastering
and
not
yet
got
to
the
one
of
thatching
or
lining
numberless
birds
including
other
members
of
this
family
line
their
nests
with
grass
or
other
soft
materials
whereas
plastering
is
a
comparatively
rare
habit
it
is
legitimate
to
assume
that
that
which
is
common
has
preceded
that
which
is
rare
i
would
here
point
out
that
whilst
in
works
of
ornithology
reference
is
always
made
to
the
strange
habit
which
the
thrush
has
of
daubing
its
nest
nothing
as
a
rule
is
said
in
regard
to
the
similar
habit
of
the
blackbird
or
if
anything
is
we
are
told
merely
that
mud
is
used
to
bind
the
materials
together
the
facts
however
are
as
i
state
and
did
the
blackbird
not
line
its
nest
with
grass
after
it
had
so
carefully
plastered
it
with
mud
brought
from
the
waterside
it
would
be
as
noted
in
this
respect
as
is
the
thrush
its
near
relative
i
have
never
heard
the
male
blackbird
sing
whilst
thus
attending
the
female
as
she
built
her
nest
not
even
when
he
waited
for
her
in
a
tree
during
the
actual
time
of
its
fashioning
though
here
was
a
fine
poetical
opportunity
for
him
song
it
seemed
had
ended
when
once
his
bride
had
been
won
and
his
rivals
vanquished
by
it
it
was
the
same
to
a
considerable
extent
with
a
pair
of
nightingales
that
i
watched
under
similar
circumstances
i
did
indeed
sometimes
hear
the
song
when
the
bird
singing
was
invisible
and
therefore
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
not
this
particular
one
which
for
other
reasons
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
but
during
far
the
greater
part
of
the
time
and
always
when
i
could
see
him
he
was
as
silent
as
his
mate
it
was
in
the
early
morning
and
not
the
but
nightingales
sing
at
all
hours
both
of
the
day
and
night
the
early
morning
is
indeed
a
favourite
time
with
them
and
it
is
then
in
the
beginning
of
spring
when
nests
have
yet
to
be
built
and
before
the
birds
are
properly
married
that
one
can
best
observe
how
powerful
a
vehicle
of
hatred
and
rivalry
their
melodious
strains
are
i
have
closely
watched
two
rival
males
for
nearly
an
hour
let
anyone
refer
to
my
account
of
the
rival
wheatears
substitute
a
plantation
with
bush
and
tangle
and
the
roadside
adjoining
for
the
open
sandy
warrens
and
song
but
much
more
frequently
indulged
in
for
the
little
frenzied
dancings
and
the
two
pictures
will
be
identical
or
nearly
so
there
was
the
same
keeping
close
to
yet
not
appearing
to
follow
each
other
the
attending
to
each
other
motions
without
seeming
specially
to
watch
them
the
drawing
near
and
then
getting
apart
only
to
approach
again
the
little
bursts
of
fury
but
here
mostly
harmonious
preceding
each
engagement
and
surmounting
each
time
that
discretionary
part
of
valour
which
in
either
case
both
the
birds
seemed
largely
to
possess
there
were
three
engagements
one
bird
each
time
making
as
though
no
longer
able
to
control
itself
a
sudden
little
frenzied
dash
at
the
other
in
no
case
however
was
the
conflict
very
severe
and
the
attacked
bird
soon
flew
away
with
which
result
the
attacker
seemed
well
satisfied
it
looked
more
like
a
little
furious
play
than
a
real
fight
and
so
no
doubt
it
would
were
moth
or
cobweb
to
have
a
tussle
with
peaseblossom
or
mustardseed
oberon
and
titania
indeed
squared
so
that
all
their
elves
for
fear
crept
into
and
hid
them
there
but
here
the
audience
were
themselves
fairies
so
that
it
was
all
in
proportion
besides
the
war
was
but
of
words
and
in
these
we
see
how
the
prettiness
of
being
fairies
prevails
even
over
the
relationship
in
which
the
two
stood
to
each
other
so
it
was
with
these
warriors
they
were
rivals
and
stuffed
full
of
dislike
nay
hatred
but
also
they
were
birds
and
nightingales
the
wheatears
however
sang
as
well
as
danced
jealousy
however
did
not
seem
to
blind
them
to
the
merit
of
each
other
performance
though
often
one
upon
hearing
the
sweet
hostile
strains
would
burst
forth
instantly
itself
and
here
there
was
no
certain
mark
of
appreciation
yet
sometimes
perhaps
quite
as
often
it
would
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
listen
with
exactly
the
appearance
of
a
musical
connoisseur
weighing
testing
and
appraising
each
note
as
it
issued
from
the
rival
bill
a
curious
expression
would
steal
or
seem
to
steal
for
fancy
may
play
her
part
in
such
matters
over
the
listening
bird
and
the
idea
appeared
to
be
how
exquisite
would
be
those
strains
were
they
not
sung
by
and
yet
i
must
admit
that
they
exquisite
sometimes
however
there
would
be
no
special
response
on
the
part
of
the
one
bird
either
by
voice
or
attitude
whilst
the
other
was
singing
during
these
musical
combats
i
often
saw
a
third
and
silent
bird
hopping
with
demure
modest
look
by
virtue
of
which
it
seemed
rather
to
creep
than
to
hop
just
within
or
just
on
the
outside
of
this
or
that
briery
bower
this
i
took
to
be
the
female
and
thinking
so
it
was
easy
to
detect
a
little
thrown
now
and
again
towards
one
or
another
of
the
rival
suitors
in
which
seemed
expressed
the
thought
of
a
pretty
little
bird
but
a
bunthorne
round
the
corner
i
can
see
each
is
kneeling
on
knee
yet
this
bird
may
have
been
but
another
male
to
whom
the
next
unseen
notes
that
i
heard
were
perhaps
due
always
i
bless
those
birds
whose
sexes
are
plainly
distinguishable
from
each
other
what
was
very
noticeable
in
these
nightingales
and
the
remark
applies
to
others
that
i
have
closely
listened
to
was
that
even
when
not
singing
against
each
other
they
made
little
noises
in
their
throats
and
these
when
distinctly
heard
resolved
themselves
into
a
deep
guttural
sound
which
though
far
from
unpleasing
could
hardly
be
called
anything
but
a
croak
this
sound
as
i
have
noticed
is
very
frequently
uttered
it
often
commences
the
song
or
is
even
intermingled
with
though
it
can
scarcely
be
said
to
belong
to
it
it
does
not
in
this
case
diminish
the
beauty
of
the
melody
yet
did
it
stand
alone
the
nightingale
would
be
merely
a
somewhat
musical
croaker
probably
this
is
what
it
once
has
been
the
low
croaking
note
representing
the
original
utterance
of
the
bird
on
which
the
song
by
successive
variations
and
choice
of
them
on
the
part
of
the
female
has
been
founded
just
as
in
the
dull
plumage
of
female
pheasants
and
other
birds
the
males
of
which
are
splendidly
adorned
or
in
both
the
sexes
of
some
species
belonging
to
the
same
families
we
see
the
early
state
of
their
common
plain
progenitors
so
in
the
uninspired
workaday
voice
of
or
twitter
the
spoken
language
as
one
may
call
it
probably
represents
the
humble
roots
from
which
the
various
trees
of
song
with
all
their
diversified
branchings
and
fluttering
trembling
leaves
have
shot
up
beautifully
into
the
sky
how
distinct
in
their
glories
are
the
mature
males
of
the
golden
silver
the
impeyan
or
our
own
common
pheasant
how
drabbily
alike
are
the
females
of
all
of
them
and
they
themselves
in
their
first
early
plumage
so
whilst
the
song
of
the
blackbird
missel
fieldfare
or
redwing
are
distinct
or
suggest
each
other
only
by
their
general
quality
all
have
a
high
harsh
scolding
note
which
is
very
much
the
same
except
in
degree
though
differing
in
the
frequency
with
which
it
is
employed
loudest
and
harshest
of
all
is
the
fieldfare
and
this
bird
has
hardly
developed
a
song
the
missel
whose
lay
is
very
inferior
to
that
of
the
is
also
a
frequent
and
loud
scolder
so
that
many
a
man
whilst
alone
and
in
the
wild
woods
might
fancy
himself
within
the
bosom
of
his
family
in
the
common
thrush
however
who
is
such
a
fine
singer
this
note
of
fear
is
not
nearly
so
often
heard
and
its
shrewish
character
though
still
there
has
been
softened
in
the
blackbird
it
is
still
more
rare
yet
occasionally
if
i
mistake
not
it
is
uttered
again
the
note
of
the
blackbird
when
disturbed
though
this
varies
considerably
is
common
also
though
in
a
less
degree
to
the
thrush
so
that
it
is
possible
to
mistake
the
one
bird
for
the
other
the
same
remarks
apply
to
many
finches
and
other
small
birds
who
whilst
they
sing
very
differently
chirp
and
twitter
in
much
the
same
way
in
all
these
cases
as
i
believe
there
is
a
certain
correspondence
between
the
tone
or
pitch
of
the
language
and
that
of
the
song
from
the
low
croak
as
i
have
called
it
of
the
nightingale
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
the
high
clear
notes
of
the
thrush
having
been
developed
whilst
it
would
account
for
the
low
key
in
which
its
own
are
generally
pitched
what
i
mean
is
for
i
am
not
versed
in
musical
terminology
that
in
the
nightingale
song
there
are
not
those
high
clear
ringing
notes
which
we
hear
in
that
of
the
thrush
blackcap
skylark
and
many
other
birds
just
as
in
these
we
may
listen
in
vain
for
those
richer
and
more
liquid
tones
which
charm
us
so
in
the
nightingale
beautiful
as
these
tones
are
they
do
not
any
more
than
those
of
other
birds
include
every
excellence
and
that
particular
one
which
they
lack
being
common
to
so
many
of
our
songsters
has
come
to
be
something
which
one
loves
and
listens
for
whenever
bird
sings
upon
bough
partly
because
of
this
perhaps
and
partly
because
of
the
very
of
the
nightingale
as
a
singer
i
have
sometimes
missed
these
franker
strains
whilst
listening
to
its
song
in
a
way
in
which
i
have
never
missed
its
own
more
dulcet
notes
from
the
song
of
lark
or
thrush
to
say
that
pindar
is
not
sappho
is
no
blame
to
pindar
but
the
short
continuance
and
frequent
pauses
in
the
song
of
the
nightingale
is
i
think
a
real
fault
and
from
the
blame
of
it
this
frequently
escapes
when
other
sweet
but
not
so
singers
are
taken
thereupon
to
task
the
poor
blackbird
for
instance
whose
ditty
is
most
has
been
rated
in
these
terms
yet
as
a
rule
in
my
experience
it
sings
continuously
for
a
longer
time
than
does
the
nightingale
whose
sometimes
almost
constant
cessations
just
when
one
whole
soul
cries
out
like
jacques
more
more
i
prythee
more
have
even
an
irritating
effect
indeed
if
this
were
always
so
it
would
be
a
serious
drawback
even
to
a
song
so
full
of
excellence
but
it
is
not
always
so
sometimes
on
still
warm
nights
when
the
stars
seem
to
breathe
and
tremble
and
the
air
is
like
a
lazy
kiss
and
if
nights
are
not
like
this
in
england
yet
the
song
itself
makes
them
seem
so
the
rich
full
notes
are
poured
forth
in
a
continuous
stream
of
melody
that
lasts
long
and
whilst
it
lasts
seems
to
create
the
world
afresh
some
time
afterwards
indeed
one
notices
that
the
effect
has
not
been
quite
so
powerful
and
that
this
crying
want
has
still
to
be
filled
but
the
dear
bird
has
done
its
best
sie
jubelt
so
traurig
sie
schluchzet
so
froh
vergessene
träume
erwachen
says
heine
whilst
others
say
that
the
song
is
apt
to
keep
them
awake
at
night
and
having
first
paid
their
orthodox
tribute
to
its
supremacy
over
every
other
will
confess
that
they
have
sometimes
been
obliged
to
open
the
window
and
throw
something
out
to
put
a
stop
to
it
yet
the
thought
of
how
appreciative
the
world
really
is
and
how
severely
a
heretic
in
such
a
matter
may
be
dealt
with
shall
not
deter
me
from
expressing
a
slight
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
this
supremacy
or
at
least
of
its
extent
and
absoluteness
letters
each
year
to
the
papers
from
people
who
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
the
nightingale
long
before
the
nightingale
is
accustomed
to
reach
our
shores
have
given
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
a
thrush
is
in
most
cases
the
real
performer
and
if
this
be
so
it
shows
that
with
many
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
depend
upon
its
being
known
for
certain
which
is
which
for
myself
i
go
with
the
general
opinion
in
this
respect
yet
it
is
difficult
to
summon
up
in
imagination
the
effect
that
the
clear
joyous
notes
of
the
thrush
might
have
upon
one
did
they
ring
out
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
night
and
if
this
is
true
in
regard
to
the
thrush
does
it
not
apply
still
more
to
the
skylark
a
bird
whose
lovely
and
outpouring
uttered
as
it
is
in
the
day
and
all
around
common
and
therefore
of
necessity
undervalued
may
yet
as
it
appears
to
me
in
spite
of
such
a
disadvantage
well
challenge
comparison
with
the
song
of
the
nightingale
itself
if
we
look
to
effect
at
any
rate
the
former
bird
seems
to
have
inspired
poets
as
highly
or
almost
as
highly
as
the
latter
then
we
have
an
opinion
which
perhaps
may
have
been
that
of
shakespeare
himself
who
was
a
rare
lover
of
music
that
the
nightingale
if
she
should
sing
by
day
when
every
goose
is
cackling
would
be
thought
no
better
a
musician
than
the
wren
now
the
nightingale
does
sing
by
day
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
then
thought
at
least
no
better
than
the
lark
or
thrush
in
fact
she
is
like
these
often
not
noticed
at
all
as
i
have
had
some
opportunities
of
observing
this
at
least
shows
that
some
of
the
effect
produced
upon
some
of
us
by
this
bird
song
is
due
to
that
added
and
exquisite
poetry
which
night
and
silence
gives
to
it
we
have
no
other
bird
who
is
sufficiently
common
and
whose
song
is
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
distinguished
for
it
to
attract
much
attention
and
therefore
the
nightingale
has
this
great
advantage
practically
all
to
itself
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
owes
to
this
that
and
superiority
which
has
been
accorded
to
it
in
popular
estimation
over
all
our
other
especially
such
glorious
ones
as
the
skylark
thrush
blackcap
blackbird
etc
proximity
to
the
nest
with
young
is
the
most
frequent
cause
especially
when
driven
from
the
eggs
but
do
the
musical
powers
of
some
birds
differ
in
different
countries
never
have
i
heard
the
two
last
sing
here
as
i
have
in
germany
germans
as
we
know
are
very
musical
have
the
same
general
causes
which
it
will
be
said
that
i
can
not
appreciate
the
song
of
the
nightingale
though
i
am
trying
only
properly
to
appreciate
that
of
other
members
of
the
choir
yet
if
i
were
to
say
that
shakespeare
was
full
of
imperfections
that
was
a
dull
play
a
i
forget
what
something
uncomplimentary
play
and
such
a
one
as
allowed
the
discerning
admirer
a
de
to
see
the
author
expression
whilst
writing
it
that
moreover
the
seven
ages
of
man
was
by
no
means
a
fine
passage
and
that
soliloquy
had
been
much
it
would
not
be
said
on
this
account
that
i
was
unable
to
appreciate
shakespeare
i
judge
so
because
others
who
make
these
and
similar
statements
whether
they
or
the
baconians
are
the
more
pestilent
i
find
it
difficult
to
decide
pass
apparently
for
the
appreciative
persons
which
i
suppose
they
think
themselves
to
be
yet
they
can
think
so
puzzles
me
for
people
who
write
in
this
way
must
be
really
as
much
bored
by
shakespeare
as
shakespeare
would
have
been
by
them
had
an
introduction
been
possible
and
they
must
have
found
this
out
i
wish
the
poor
gullible
public
would
how
i
should
rejoice
to
be
accused
yes
and
even
convicted
of
having
no
ear
for
the
song
of
the
nightingale
if
only
it
could
be
discovered
also
that
critics
who
with
a
natural
incapacity
for
seeing
beauty
beauty
yet
step
modestly
forward
to
teach
us
and
dance
as
fantastically
on
the
body
of
a
dead
poet
as
did
ever
a
lilliputian
on
that
of
the
sleeping
gulliver
are
neither
profound
nor
discerning
nor
even
literary
but
merely
dull
dogs
posing
of
which
sort
indeed
most
great
oneyers
keep
their
pack
yet
i
wish
they
could
leave
the
imperfections
of
shakespeare
which
they
discern
in
his
as
utterly
beyond
them
and
busy
themselves
only
with
the
perfections
of
such
baviuses
and
mœviuses
as
it
is
their
wont
to
crown
i
commend
them
to
old
bunyan
with
his
said
mr
see
clearly
and
so
pass
on
the
sweet
song
of
the
nightingale
has
caused
the
more
stress
to
be
laid
upon
the
sobriety
of
its
colouring
the
natural
tendency
being
to
exaggerate
such
a
contrast
but
now
when
one
watches
for
the
bird
in
the
shade
of
leafy
thickets
the
way
in
which
it
generally
reveals
itself
is
by
a
sudden
flash
of
red
or
chestnut
brown
a
bright
spot
of
colour
which
is
conspicuously
visible
sometimes
even
in
the
centre
of
a
and
one
may
almost
say
brilliantly
so
as
its
wearer
flits
amongst
the
trees
and
undergrowth
this
brightness
belongs
to
the
tail
generally
but
there
must
i
think
be
either
upon
or
just
above
it
on
the
upper
tail
coverts
perhaps
a
specially
bright
and
more
patch
which
produces
the
effect
of
which
i
speak
and
as
nightingales
habitually
haunt
wooded
and
umbrageous
spots
it
has
sometimes
occurred
to
me
that
this
has
been
developed
as
a
guiding
star
for
one
to
follow
another
by
just
as
the
white
tail
of
the
rabbit
is
supposed
to
have
been
i
have
often
watched
two
pursuing
each
other
through
the
dim
leafiness
each
uttering
a
variant
of
the
deep
croaking
note
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
which
answers
to
the
call
chirp
or
twitter
amongst
other
birds
at
such
times
the
ruddy
star
or
streak
has
always
as
i
say
been
most
conspicuous
independently
of
this
the
bird
general
colouring
is
a
pleasing
olive
brown
which
according
to
position
and
circumstances
has
a
more
or
less
glossy
appearance
the
tail
having
received
the
finest
polish
by
virtue
of
all
this
i
feel
sure
that
to
anyone
who
had
watched
and
waited
for
her
the
nightingale
would
come
rather
as
a
conspicuous
than
a
bird
at
least
amongst
our
smaller
british
birds
tits
and
chaffinches
as
it
seems
to
me
flash
less
as
they
flit
through
the
trees
therefore
when
i
read
the
eternal
remarks
about
its
dull
colouring
which
and
this
is
the
bane
of
natural
history
one
writer
hands
down
from
the
mouth
of
another
through
the
generations
i
say
to
myself
that
each
and
all
of
them
have
either
never
called
upon
the
bird
and
stayed
an
hour
or
two
or
else
that
they
have
got
out
of
the
habit
which
may
be
also
a
trouble
of
seeing
anything
other
than
as
it
is
written
so
far
from
the
nightingale
being
specially
like
a
book
in
which
lovely
songs
are
contained
to
me
it
seems
to
offer
an
example
of
a
bird
distinguished
both
by
its
musical
powers
and
to
a
much
lesser
extent
certainly
but
still
not
insignificantly
by
its
colour
also
i
am
thinking
of
its
tail
and
particularly
of
that
ruddy
star
or
patch
which
i
think
is
upon
it
and
which
little
as
it
may
seem
in
a
stuffed
specimen
or
one
quite
still
or
hardly
seen
becomes
a
conspicuous
feature
under
such
circumstances
as
i
have
mentioned
that
this
patch
or
the
whole
tail
means
something
i
feel
sure
but
as
to
whether
it
is
a
badge
or
an
ornament
whether
natural
or
sexual
selection
has
been
at
work
i
can
say
little
in
the
latter
case
the
same
force
would
have
been
brought
to
bear
in
two
different
directions
and
this
i
think
has
been
often
the
case
with
our
though
it
seems
to
have
been
agreed
to
talk
as
if
the
opposite
were
surely
the
bullfinch
chaffinch
robin
linnet
greenfinch
and
others
the
males
of
all
of
which
show
off
to
some
extent
before
the
females
have
been
selected
if
at
all
as
much
by
the
eye
as
by
the
ear
of
the
latter
whilst
the
of
australia
offers
an
example
of
a
highly
adorned
species
that
is
also
conspicuously
musical
the
nightingale
is
glossy
and
sometimes
in
effect
at
least
and
in
some
part
of
it
bright
it
may
be
getting
brighter
but
if
so
it
will
probably
have
to
rival
the
kingfisher
before
it
ceases
to
be
an
encouraging
symbol
to
those
who
hide
a
worth
which
they
feel
beneath
a
want
which
everybody
can
see
sexual
as
i
now
believe
a
recent
lucky
glimpse
of
nightingale
courtship
has
assured
me
that
i
have
not
unconsciously
exaggerated
indeed
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
broadly
fanned
tail
caught
in
the
last
rays
of
the
descending
sun
could
hardly
be
exaggerated
but
the
colour
was
on
all
the
rectrices
they
alone
i
think
are
the
patch
the
star
no
good
illustration
that
i
know
of
exists
of
the
nightingale
none
at
least
which
at
all
resembles
the
bird
as
i
have
seen
it
either
sitting
hopping
flying
singing
or
silent
in
natural
history
books
after
we
have
been
solemnly
told
that
the
male
alone
sings
that
his
song
constitutes
his
courtship
and
that
therefore
both
the
she
and
the
melancholy
of
poets
are
incorrect
we
are
generally
presented
with
a
gaunt
creature
having
a
gaze
which
is
fixed
upon
the
moon
towards
which
its
neck
and
whole
body
seem
drawn
out
as
by
some
attractive
force
this
is
the
nightingale
of
convention
but
when
i
have
seen
it
it
has
always
looked
the
pleasingly
plump
cheerful
little
brisk
active
body
that
it
really
is
and
when
it
sang
it
was
without
any
pose
in
a
attitude
which
had
almost
a
feathered
podginess
about
it
the
legs
were
bent
the
feathers
of
the
ventral
surface
touching
or
almost
touching
the
twig
of
perch
the
head
inclining
forward
at
an
easy
angle
a
cosy
homely
happy
contented
appearance
i
have
watched
one
singing
thus
for
some
time
not
once
did
he
rear
himself
up
so
as
to
become
long
thin
and
tubey
tubby
he
was
rather
and
had
not
the
faintest
resemblance
to
a
horrible
canary
bird
just
in
the
same
way
too
he
will
often
sing
on
the
ground
looking
as
homely
and
rotund
as
can
be
true
it
is
as
the
natural
history
books
tell
us
that
no
one
familiar
with
the
bird
and
its
habits
would
think
of
calling
it
or
its
song
melancholy
therefore
as
these
never
add
remembering
milton
famous
line
let
us
be
thankful
that
he
as
well
as
some
other
poets
were
not
familiar
with
it
there
has
long
been
a
nightingale
of
poetry
and
literature
grown
out
of
its
own
song
but
having
little
to
do
with
the
real
bird
which
no
one
except
strict
scientists
and
a
literary
critic
or
two
would
wish
to
do
away
with
with
regard
to
the
habits
of
the
nightingale
i
have
only
the
space
to
say
that
as
in
the
case
of
the
blackbird
the
female
alone
collects
and
arranges
the
materials
being
attended
upon
whilst
she
does
so
though
perhaps
not
quite
so
closely
by
the
male
one
should
be
cautious
however
in
concluding
that
such
is
always
the
case
either
with
this
or
other
birds
for
i
have
watched
for
some
time
one
of
a
pair
of
tits
bringing
feathers
to
the
nest
whilst
the
other
kept
near
about
with
nothing
in
its
bill
yet
ordinarily
both
sexes
work
together
in
a
most
exemplary
way
nothing
can
look
prettier
than
these
little
soft
pinky
feathery
things
as
they
creep
mousily
into
their
soft
little
purse
of
a
nest
nothing
can
look
prettier
than
they
do
as
they
sit
within
it
pulling
pushing
ramming
patting
and
arranging
finally
nothing
can
look
prettier
than
they
look
as
they
again
creep
out
of
it
and
fly
away
their
perpetual
feat
of
turning
round
in
the
nest
without
dislocating
the
tail
is
also
one
of
those
few
earthly
things
in
the
seeing
of
which
one
can
not
weary
i
have
often
tried
to
watch
these
little
birds
collecting
so
as
to
see
them
actually
find
and
fly
away
with
the
materials
for
the
nest
this
however
i
found
more
difficult
than
i
had
expected
every
time
i
saw
them
fly
out
of
their
nest
but
in
spite
of
stealthy
following
i
generally
lost
them
soon
after
they
had
entered
a
plantation
close
to
where
in
a
it
was
all
i
could
be
sure
of
was
that
they
flew
about
in
different
directions
sometimes
into
tall
sometimes
into
low
tangles
and
bushes
sometimes
too
across
the
road
again
and
into
different
parts
of
the
they
keep
for
the
most
part
together
and
whenever
they
are
near
enough
i
hear
their
soft
subdued
little
chit
as
lichen
which
is
what
they
are
now
principally
collecting
is
everywhere
about
on
the
trunks
of
trees
it
would
seem
as
though
even
a
minute
would
be
a
long
time
for
them
to
take
in
getting
a
piece
and
returning
with
it
if
they
took
it
at
random
and
the
inference
appears
to
be
that
they
exercise
choice
and
selection
and
return
each
time
from
the
nest
with
a
definite
idea
of
the
kind
of
bit
they
want
next
i
will
here
quote
from
my
notes
an
observation
i
made
on
the
way
these
little
birds
roost
at
night
which
may
perhaps
be
of
interest
on
my
way
back
i
noticed
some
object
which
i
took
to
be
a
dead
bird
in
a
tall
straggling
that
formed
a
kind
of
bower
inside
which
one
could
stand
up
thinking
that
this
bird
might
have
been
transfixed
by
a
shrike
i
came
right
under
it
and
pulling
down
the
branches
with
my
stick
to
my
astonishment
the
object
separated
and
became
four
little
fluttering
tits
that
had
been
sitting
wedged
close
together
i
stood
perfectly
still
and
after
they
had
chitted
a
little
and
made
a
few
little
hops
about
the
bush
two
of
them
came
back
from
different
directions
to
just
the
same
place
snoozled
up
to
each
other
and
were
settled
again
for
the
night
very
soon
a
third
hopped
on
to
the
two
backs
and
pressed
himself
down
between
them
taking
no
denial
and
indeed
not
receiving
any
the
fourth
remained
a
little
longer
apart
perhaps
for
ten
minutes
during
all
which
time
i
stood
without
a
motion
leaning
on
my
stick
and
had
at
last
the
satisfaction
to
see
him
come
perching
down
towards
the
bough
then
perch
on
the
three
backs
just
as
the
third
had
done
on
the
two
and
squeeze
himself
in
amongst
them
so
that
two
were
on
one
side
of
him
and
one
on
the
other
all
four
now
sat
closely
pressed
together
three
tails
projecting
on
one
side
of
the
twig
and
the
fourth
on
the
other
i
sat
down
in
the
bush
and
made
this
entry
whilst
the
birdies
surely
the
prettiest
little
ones
almost
in
the
world
went
to
sleep
next
night
at
about
six
i
took
up
my
position
in
the
same
place
and
waited
after
i
had
sat
silently
for
a
few
minutes
i
saw
a
pair
of
the
tits
creeping
softly
about
through
the
bushes
adjacent
uttering
the
little
chitter
in
a
very
subdued
tone
one
was
soon
in
the
actual
bush
but
crept
out
of
it
again
and
went
away
with
the
other
in
another
four
or
five
minutes
however
they
both
return
this
time
coming
more
quickly
and
directly
to
the
bush
when
soon
getting
from
opposite
sides
to
very
much
the
same
part
of
it
as
before
they
sidle
to
each
other
along
the
particular
twig
and
then
squeeze
and
press
together
so
tightly
that
their
outline
on
the
inner
side
is
quite
lost
like
that
of
a
double
cherry
thus
pressed
and
wedged
each
little
bird
preens
itself
the
two
little
heads
moving
about
and
seeming
to
belong
to
one
quite
round
body
having
one
tail
for
their
two
tails
are
pressed
for
their
whole
length
together
when
their
heads
turn
inwards
the
little
birds
appear
to
be
caressing
each
other
and
they
must
i
think
sometimes
catch
hold
of
each
other
feathers
but
it
is
all
part
or
intended
to
be
part
of
the
process
of
preening
themselves
this
close
pressing
seems
to
be
a
pleasure
in
itself
independently
of
the
result
of
warmth
for
sometimes
they
will
come
unstuck
as
it
were
and
move
a
little
away
from
each
other
along
the
twig
in
order
to
press
and
squeeze
again
for
a
little
then
their
tails
may
be
separate
but
soon
they
rejoin
and
the
heads
being
now
quiet
for
they
are
going
to
sleep
and
tucked
closely
in
amongst
the
feathers
of
the
breast
their
outlines
never
very
salient
are
entirely
lost
and
the
two
birds
have
become
one
perfectly
globular
one
without
a
head
and
with
a
long
tail
thus
two
of
these
tits
have
returned
again
to
roost
in
the
same
place
but
the
other
pair
do
not
come
to
the
bush
it
is
interesting
to
watch
building
their
nests
or
rather
excavating
the
tunnels
in
which
they
will
afterwards
be
built
to
see
one
enter
one
of
these
whilst
it
is
yet
but
a
few
inches
long
and
then
to
see
the
dust
powdering
out
at
the
aperture
as
from
the
mouth
of
an
ensconced
cannon
is
pretty
the
sand
is
scratched
out
backwards
with
the
feet
but
the
bird
also
uses
its
bill
as
a
pickaxe
often
making
a
series
of
rapid
little
blows
with
it
almost
like
a
woodpecker
the
wings
which
quite
cover
the
body
quivering
at
the
same
time
both
sexes
work
at
the
hole
and
both
often
fly
together
to
it
one
remaining
clinging
at
the
edge
whilst
the
other
scratches
out
the
sand
from
inside
i
have
seen
one
sitting
just
in
the
embrasure
quietly
regarding
the
outer
world
and
thus
impeding
the
entrance
of
his
partner
who
at
last
squeezed
by
him
with
great
difficulty
sometimes
three
or
four
will
descend
upon
the
same
hole
and
cling
there
without
quarrelling
but
once
i
saw
a
bird
in
a
hole
attacked
by
another
who
flew
suddenly
down
upon
it
with
a
little
twittering
scream
though
each
pair
of
birds
excavate
their
own
tunnel
yet
the
whole
community
or
at
any
rate
a
large
proportion
of
it
will
sometimes
work
together
sweeping
on
to
the
pit
face
in
a
body
clinging
there
and
burrowing
with
a
constant
twittering
then
darting
off
silently
in
a
cloud
and
sailing
and
circling
round
in
the
pit
amphitheatre
making
when
the
sky
is
blue
and
the
sun
bright
a
warm
and
delicious
picture
such
as
the
greeks
must
have
loved
to
gaze
on
as
each
bird
however
only
works
at
his
own
and
his
partner
hole
it
is
evident
that
this
kind
of
social
working
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
ants
or
bees
and
other
such
insect
communities
though
it
has
something
of
that
appearance
sometimes
for
a
short
time
all
the
birds
will
keep
fluttering
round
in
small
circles
that
only
extend
a
little
beyond
the
face
of
the
cliff
not
rising
to
a
greater
height
than
their
own
tunnels
in
it
which
they
almost
touch
each
time
as
they
come
round
they
look
like
eddies
in
a
stream
beneath
the
bank
but
are
not
so
silent
for
all
are
twittering
excitedly
this
is
an
interesting
thing
to
see
a
kind
of
aerial
manœuvres
the
special
cause
of
which
if
there
be
one
is
not
obvious
but
we
will
suppose
that
the
birds
are
now
all
working
either
inside
their
tunnels
or
clinging
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
all
at
once
either
at
or
about
the
same
instant
of
time
they
all
fly
off
darting
away
and
disseminate
themselves
in
the
sky
not
one
being
left
either
in
or
about
the
pit
in
a
few
minutes
they
return
but
as
is
the
case
with
the
small
birds
at
the
stacks
not
in
nearly
so
instantaneous
or
simultaneous
a
manner
and
this
may
be
repeated
for
a
greater
or
lesser
number
of
times
all
the
remarks
that
i
have
made
in
regard
to
this
phenomenon
in
the
case
of
other
birds
apply
equally
here
perhaps
indeed
to
a
greater
extent
for
as
remarked
at
the
moment
of
each
sudden
exodus
a
certain
number
sometimes
about
half
of
these
will
be
more
or
less
hidden
within
the
holes
they
are
excavating
yet
out
they
all
dart
with
the
rest
such
sudden
flights
and
disappearances
for
a
few
minutes
after
which
all
come
back
strike
me
as
being
extremely
curious
appear
to
be
pugnacious
indeed
they
sometimes
fight
fiercely
and
i
have
seen
two
after
closing
with
a
sharp
shrill
charr
and
struggling
in
the
air
for
a
little
roll
down
the
steep
declivity
of
sand
in
which
the
perpendicular
face
of
the
pit
often
ends
it
therefore
seems
the
more
curious
that
they
allow
their
holes
to
be
taken
possession
of
by
sparrows
and
also
by
without
offering
any
resistance
i
have
seen
one
of
the
latter
birds
sitting
quietly
and
calmly
in
the
mouth
of
a
hole
whilst
a
pair
of
martins
who
had
probably
excavated
it
hovered
excitedly
just
over
and
about
him
but
without
doing
more
on
many
other
more
or
less
similar
occasions
there
has
been
excitement
on
the
part
of
the
martins
but
never
an
attack
yet
a
or
even
a
sparrow
is
not
such
a
very
much
larger
and
stronger
bird
than
a
and
considering
the
numbers
of
the
latter
as
well
as
their
greater
activity
and
powers
of
flight
it
seems
to
me
an
odd
thing
that
they
should
submit
to
such
a
usurpation
so
tamely
if
they
are
not
capable
of
combining
together
in
order
to
expel
a
stranger
from
the
colony
this
speaks
little
for
their
intelligence
as
they
have
at
least
been
generally
two
to
one
this
is
a
good
working
majority
and
why
under
such
circumstances
an
impudent
sparrow
should
be
allowed
to
sit
quietly
in
the
home
whereinto
he
has
intruded
i
can
not
quite
understand
but
so
it
is
or
so
at
least
it
has
been
in
my
own
experience
but
i
must
not
wrong
the
sparrow
let
me
recall
that
word
impudent
and
bury
still
more
deeply
another
one
to
wit
unscrupulous
that
i
was
about
to
make
use
of
a
sparrow
when
he
thus
acts
is
simply
annexing
territory
and
should
have
all
the
credit
of
forbearance
and
that
belongs
to
such
an
act
his
motives
in
doing
so
are
no
doubt
as
creditable
as
are
those
which
restrain
him
from
acting
similarly
in
the
case
of
more
powerful
birds
and
if
a
doubt
of
this
should
ever
cross
his
mind
he
need
only
read
a
newspaper
or
two
and
listen
to
some
speeches
in
the
house
he
will
know
the
integrity
of
his
own
heart
then
it
seems
wonderful
that
a
bird
of
the
swallow
tribe
so
aerial
and
without
any
special
structural
adaptation
for
burrowing
should
be
capable
of
driving
horizontal
shafts
into
the
face
of
a
bank
or
pit
to
the
length
sometimes
of
seven
or
even
it
is
said
nine
feet
though
the
excavations
be
in
sand
yet
this
is
often
of
a
very
firm
consistency
and
moreover
in
many
pits
the
face
of
which
had
been
largely
tunnelled
by
these
birds
sand
was
a
good
deal
mingled
with
a
fairly
stiff
clay
though
i
have
not
been
able
to
watch
the
process
of
excavation
from
the
commencement
so
thoroughly
as
i
should
have
liked
to
have
done
yet
i
have
seen
it
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
will
now
quote
from
the
notes
which
i
took
down
on
one
such
occasion
at
the
pit
about
a
great
number
of
birds
are
working
and
there
is
not
now
the
same
regularity
in
their
movements
all
coming
to
the
holes
and
darting
away
together
at
intervals
as
was
the
case
for
a
time
at
least
when
i
first
watched
them
though
so
late
several
birds
are
but
just
commencing
to
make
their
holes
and
to
watch
these
is
most
interesting
two
plans
seem
to
be
employed
in
the
first
the
bird
constantly
flutters
its
wings
whilst
with
its
feet
it
at
the
same
time
clings
to
and
scratches
the
face
of
the
cliff
thus
it
partly
hovers
in
the
air
and
partly
keeps
itself
in
position
with
its
feet
but
more
with
the
tail
which
is
fanned
out
and
pressed
in
against
the
cliff
like
a
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
it
is
on
the
second
way
is
more
curious
the
wings
here
are
partly
extended
but
instead
of
being
fluttered
they
are
pressed
close
against
the
sandy
wall
moving
about
over
this
they
seem
to
feel
for
every
little
inequality
into
which
they
can
wedge
themselves
and
this
the
bird
does
also
with
his
breast
and
the
most
available
part
of
his
body
the
tail
being
fanned
and
pressed
to
the
cliff
whilst
the
feet
all
the
while
are
scratching
vigorously
in
this
way
a
bird
will
sometimes
crawl
or
rather
wedge
itself
about
over
the
pit
face
which
though
it
may
be
perpendicular
or
almost
so
is
yet
full
of
roughnesses
and
inequalities
appearing
to
seek
either
the
most
yielding
surface
to
scratch
or
the
best
place
to
get
fixed
into
whilst
scratching
and
in
doing
this
it
leaves
a
track
on
the
sand
or
gravel
which
is
quite
perceptible
through
the
glasses
and
which
i
believe
is
made
by
the
strongly
tail
as
well
as
by
the
feet
it
thus
clings
with
wings
tail
and
body
whilst
scratching
far
more
than
clinging
with
its
claws
it
may
be
asked
what
part
in
all
this
does
the
beak
play
in
those
birds
which
i
have
been
just
now
watching
at
some
twenty
paces
through
glasses
that
brought
them
just
under
my
eyes
and
in
bright
sunlight
it
seemed
to
play
none
at
all
it
might
have
been
expected
that
in
thus
commencing
the
martins
would
cling
with
the
feet
whilst
working
with
the
bill
these
have
certainly
not
done
so
nor
have
they
ever
been
head
downwards
either
now
or
before
i
have
not
yet
seen
a
in
this
position
or
even
approaching
to
it
the
tail
which
is
made
to
play
so
great
a
part
would
here
lose
much
of
its
efficacy
but
i
do
not
at
all
think
that
they
never
do
hang
like
this
within
certain
wide
limits
birds
in
my
experience
act
not
uniformly
but
with
great
variety
probably
with
longer
watching
i
should
have
seen
this
attitude
and
also
the
bill
used
as
well
as
the
feet
whether
it
is
used
or
not
in
the
first
commencement
of
an
excavation
it
certainly
is
in
the
way
i
have
described
during
the
later
stages
illustration
a
i
notice
again
this
morning
a
particular
hole
only
about
an
inch
deep
and
at
the
bottom
of
which
there
is
a
large
stone
naturally
imbedded
in
the
sand
no
birds
are
now
working
at
this
but
on
the
last
occasion
one
was
attacked
several
times
in
succession
whilst
doing
so
by
another
this
seems
as
though
the
one
bird
of
a
pair
had
thought
the
place
unsuitable
on
account
of
the
stone
and
not
allowed
the
other
to
work
there
thus
delicately
are
matrimonial
teachings
conveyed
amongst
birds
not
one
unkind
word
did
i
hear
upon
either
side
whilst
watching
these
a
pretty
little
quadrupedal
picture
was
also
presented
to
me
a
rabbit
the
mother
of
three
came
with
them
all
from
her
burrow
which
was
near
the
top
of
the
pit
where
it
joined
the
fields
on
one
side
and
couched
there
delicately
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
young
ones
flung
themselves
all
three
on
their
backs
and
wedging
themselves
under
her
two
of
them
took
their
breakfast
in
this
position
the
third
one
however
having
tried
in
vain
to
get
properly
under
her
chest
made
a
detour
and
then
took
her
in
the
flank
in
ordinary
formation
and
with
successful
results
to
see
this
with
the
warm
bright
sand
as
a
background
and
the
swallows
flying
round
lying
dozing
in
the
morning
one
may
have
pretty
dreams
but
they
are
not
often
prettier
than
this
blue
sky
too
though
it
is
england
and
in
the
depth
of
spring
i
have
spoken
of
blackbirds
bringing
materials
times
to
the
nest
in
the
course
of
three
hours
but
this
is
very
slow
work
and
would
be
even
if
both
birds
were
to
bring
them
instead
of
only
one
comparatively
i
mean
and
the
bird
that
i
am
taking
as
a
standard
of
comparison
is
the
great
crested
grebe
in
fifty
minutes
a
pair
of
these
that
i
watched
had
brought
between
them
one
hundred
cargoes
of
weed
some
so
large
that
the
head
of
the
bird
carrying
them
was
almost
hidden
and
some
trailing
on
the
water
for
a
considerable
way
behind
each
bird
dives
and
comes
up
with
its
green
shining
burden
with
which
it
at
once
swims
to
the
great
heap
of
similar
material
which
both
have
collected
and
which
projects
a
few
inches
above
the
water
at
but
a
short
distance
from
the
bank
the
male
is
if
possible
more
earnest
and
indefatigable
in
the
great
work
than
even
the
female
and
sometimes
he
will
work
for
a
little
alone
whilst
she
is
resting
yet
with
all
this
it
is
apparent
at
once
that
she
is
the
more
effective
of
the
two
in
her
actual
workmanship
she
dives
more
quickly
and
comes
up
each
time
with
a
larger
load
so
large
sometimes
that
her
head
is
pulled
right
back
as
she
drags
it
along
the
surface
of
the
water
she
places
it
too
if
this
is
not
fancy
a
little
more
deftly
and
quickly
showing
in
everything
a
higher
degree
of
professional
skill
though
her
colleague
besides
being
second
only
to
herself
in
this
seems
as
i
say
to
glow
with
a
more
ardent
enthusiasm
huge
as
the
mass
of
weeds
is
which
constitutes
the
nest
of
these
birds
it
is
collected
by
them
in
an
astonishingly
short
space
of
time
how
short
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
but
this
i
can
positively
say
that
whereas
on
a
certain
morning
i
could
see
no
trace
of
it
above
the
surface
of
the
water
on
the
morning
after
this
it
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
finished
though
the
male
bird
alone
once
added
very
slightly
to
it
not
occupying
more
than
a
few
minutes
in
so
doing
as
to
this
however
it
can
be
said
in
a
certain
sense
that
the
nest
never
is
finished
or
at
any
rate
not
till
after
the
female
has
begun
to
lay
her
eggs
morning
after
morning
the
male
brings
weeds
to
the
heap
that
his
partner
is
sitting
on
but
as
i
had
to
leave
early
in
this
stage
of
the
bird
domestic
history
i
can
not
tell
for
how
long
he
continues
to
do
this
probably
as
in
the
case
of
the
shag
and
also
i
believe
the
the
nest
is
added
to
during
the
whole
time
that
the
birds
make
use
of
it
a
nest
however
may
properly
be
considered
finished
from
the
time
that
it
is
to
receive
the
eggs
and
the
sitting
bird
and
according
to
this
these
two
grebes
must
have
built
theirs
between
about
on
one
day
and
on
the
next
now
in
my
experience
these
birds
only
work
during
the
early
morning
from
dawn
or
thereabouts
up
to
about
or
possibly
they
may
begin
again
in
the
evening
or
work
at
night
but
i
never
saw
them
building
or
even
before
it
was
finished
near
the
nest
at
any
later
time
of
the
day
that
the
nest
i
speak
of
was
not
begun
till
on
the
one
day
is
practically
certain
for
up
to
that
time
the
birds
were
building
another
one
so
that
unless
as
i
say
they
worked
on
the
evening
of
that
day
or
in
the
they
must
have
begun
and
finished
it
in
one
morning
between
dawn
as
we
may
suppose
and
and
this
is
what
i
believe
if
so
it
seems
a
remarkable
feat
but
the
swiftness
with
which
they
dive
and
swim
up
with
their
cargoes
and
the
bulk
of
weeds
which
these
represent
makes
me
think
it
possible
though
i
must
confess
that
all
the
work
which
i
actually
saw
on
the
morning
in
question
made
little
perceptible
difference
in
the
size
of
the
heap
that
was
already
there
on
my
arrival
like
an
iceberg
the
great
mass
of
the
nest
is
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
it
seems
to
be
woven
amongst
the
stems
of
growing
weeds
or
other
aquatic
plants
but
i
have
noticed
in
it
indeed
i
have
seen
the
birds
placing
and
carrying
them
sticks
of
some
size
one
end
of
which
is
fixed
amongst
the
mass
whilst
the
other
sinks
down
into
the
mud
and
the
tangle
that
may
spring
from
it
such
sticks
must
act
as
so
many
anchors
and
may
perhaps
be
the
chief
means
by
which
the
nest
is
kept
stationary
to
judge
by
the
two
birds
which
i
particularly
watched
the
great
crested
grebe
has
the
habit
of
building
several
nests
and
besides
this
the
male
makes
a
small
platform
of
weeds
just
off
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
near
to
the
nest
sometimes
he
seems
in
doubt
whether
to
take
his
weeds
to
the
nest
or
the
platform
and
in
this
hesitation
and
in
the
building
of
more
than
one
nest
we
may
perhaps
see
the
origin
of
the
latter
structure
with
regard
to
this
and
some
other
points
which
seemed
to
me
of
interest
i
may
refer
to
a
paper
of
mine
which
has
lately
appeared
in
the
in
this
i
give
a
minute
account
of
the
and
some
other
habits
of
these
birds
as
illustrated
by
a
pair
which
i
watched
very
closely
and
i
will
here
record
my
conviction
that
there
is
more
to
be
learnt
by
such
watching
of
any
one
species
or
even
any
one
individual
bird
than
in
the
killing
or
robbing
of
thousands
may
when
i
say
this
it
is
not
only
of
the
interest
that
there
is
in
a
creature
ways
and
habits
that
i
am
thinking
but
also
of
the
light
that
these
may
at
any
moment
throw
upon
its
descent
and
affinities
upon
all
those
questions
and
subjects
which
are
suggested
by
the
word
evolution
and
the
names
of
darwin
and
wallace
to
have
a
true
classificatory
system
seems
to
be
now
the
grand
ideal
of
the
naturalist
and
this
i
suppose
must
be
called
a
high
one
though
it
is
wonderful
how
in
some
modern
works
the
soul
of
it
has
been
taken
out
of
the
body
so
that
all
has
become
dull
and
pedantic
again
though
a
flight
of
stairs
higher
up
than
some
fifty
years
ago
thus
can
a
matter
seem
rich
or
poor
as
one
or
another
treats
of
it
but
habits
and
instincts
are
as
strongly
inherited
as
structure
so
that
as
it
appears
to
me
the
study
of
life
is
even
from
the
orthodox
scientific
point
of
view
as
important
as
the
study
of
death
yet
it
is
death
that
most
zoologists
as
they
call
themselves
really
revel
in
and
though
they
may
not
say
so
one
can
not
help
feeling
that
they
are
a
great
deal
happier
and
more
comfortable
dissecting
a
body
in
their
study
than
studying
a
life
even
admitting
that
both
ways
of
acquiring
knowledge
are
equally
efficacious
and
legitimate
yet
this
is
very
clear
that
the
destruction
of
any
species
ends
both
in
regard
to
it
we
can
no
more
dissect
the
great
auk
or
the
dodo
or
blow
their
eggs
now
than
we
can
observe
their
habits
thus
it
is
not
only
beauty
but
knowledge
also
how
great
and
how
varied
who
can
say
that
is
being
every
day
drained
out
of
the
world
and
against
this
there
is
as
it
seems
to
me
an
insufficient
protest
on
the
part
of
scientific
men
as
a
body
they
care
too
little
about
it
when
they
think
of
birds
or
beasts
it
is
under
glass
cases
in
museums
that
their
eye
sees
them
and
if
there
is
only
a
specimen
nay
a
bone
or
a
feather
in
one
of
these
it
is
to
them
as
though
a
nation
had
been
saved
more
if
only
a
specimen
or
a
bone
or
feather
can
be
got
for
a
museum
in
which
they
are
interested
for
the
sake
of
it
such
nation
perish
and
of
this
spirit
we
have
only
lately
had
a
salient
example
in
their
writings
these
serenities
are
accustomed
to
speak
calmly
of
the
approaching
extinction
of
this
or
that
more
or
less
lovely
or
interesting
creature
say
for
instance
the
of
australia
if
happily
such
and
such
a
museum
has
been
supplied
or
if
professor
somebody
has
ascertained
this
or
that
in
regard
to
it
or
professors
and
the
public
generally
are
exhorted
to
obtain
such
supplies
or
such
information
before
the
end
comes
before
the
end
comes
every
effort
should
be
exhausted
every
nerve
strained
to
avert
such
end
which
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
could
be
averted
if
the
requisite
measures
were
taken
this
way
of
writing
however
is
not
calculated
to
further
such
efforts
or
to
hasten
the
taking
of
such
measures
indifference
at
least
with
regard
to
the
greater
evil
is
but
too
clearly
indicated
and
to
this
indifference
the
life
of
species
after
species
is
sacrificed
no
one
of
course
supposes
that
the
opinions
or
emotions
of
a
scientific
body
and
in
this
i
mean
to
include
more
than
the
term
strictly
covers
would
exercise
any
influence
on
men
or
brainless
and
heartless
women
but
they
might
on
that
great
army
of
collectors
who
thinking
all
the
while
that
they
are
in
some
way
doing
good
and
helping
science
keep
sweeping
countless
thousands
of
birds
beasts
eggs
and
insects
out
of
existence
alas
for
these
amiable
basilisks
these
busy
little
rinderpests
who
kill
so
and
hate
the
very
breath
of
life
without
ever
once
knowing
it
if
they
had
devoted
their
whole
lives
to
picking
pockets
or
even
to
being
politicians
they
would
have
done
at
the
end
of
them
less
harm
far
far
less
harm
in
the
world
than
they
are
now
every
day
doing
every
day
through
them
some
specific
life
that
is
or
was
of
more
value
than
all
their
individual
ones
put
together
is
getting
scarcer
or
ceasing
to
be
for
surely
a
beautiful
butterfly
say
that
for
all
time
charms
and
raises
by
charming
some
number
of
those
who
see
it
does
more
good
on
this
earth
than
any
single
man
or
woman
who
departing
leaves
no
footprints
on
the
sands
of
time
homer
for
instance
has
left
his
iliad
and
odyssey
and
these
have
been
and
still
are
mighty
in
their
effects
but
let
them
once
perish
and
homer
will
be
caught
up
and
overtaken
by
almost
any
bird
or
butterfly
even
a
brown
one
or
if
homer
will
not
assuredly
many
an
english
will
be
or
has
been
already
pye
for
instance
though
his
volumes
in
the
british
museum
are
safe
as
consols
if
there
be
any
truth
in
this
reflection
it
should
tend
to
make
us
a
little
less
conceited
than
we
are
yet
what
is
a
little
in
such
a
matter
oh
reform
it
altogether
for
myself
i
must
confess
that
i
once
belonged
to
this
great
poor
army
of
killers
though
happily
a
bad
shot
a
most
collector
and
a
poor
bungler
generally
but
now
that
i
have
watched
birds
closely
the
killing
of
them
seems
to
me
as
something
monstrous
and
horrible
and
for
every
one
that
i
have
shot
or
even
only
shot
at
and
missed
i
hate
myself
with
an
increasing
hatred
i
am
convinced
that
this
most
excellent
result
might
be
arrived
at
by
numbers
and
numbers
of
others
if
they
would
only
begin
to
do
the
same
for
the
pleasure
that
belongs
to
observation
and
inference
is
really
far
greater
than
that
which
attends
any
kind
of
skill
or
dexterity
even
when
death
and
pain
add
their
zest
to
the
latter
let
anyone
who
has
an
eye
and
a
brain
but
especially
the
latter
lay
down
the
gun
and
take
up
the
glasses
for
a
week
a
day
even
for
an
hour
if
he
is
lucky
and
he
will
never
wish
to
change
back
again
he
will
soon
come
to
regard
the
killing
of
birds
as
not
only
brutal
but
dreadfully
silly
and
his
gun
and
cartridges
once
so
dear
will
be
to
him
hereafter
as
the
toys
of
childhood
are
to
the
grown
man
nor
will
the
good
effect
stop
here
birds
are
but
a
part
of
the
life
on
this
our
earth
and
the
hatred
of
destruction
once
kindled
by
them
will
like
the
ripples
made
by
a
stone
flung
into
the
water
extend
outwards
through
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdom
till
it
include
at
last
man
himself
yes
even
the
chinese
unfortunately
long
before
anything
of
this
kind
is
likely
to
happen
all
birds
except
poultry
and
perhaps
a
lingering
sparrow
or
two
will
have
been
destroyed
this
seems
a
cheerless
prospect
but
as
usual
to
write
like
an
optimist
it
has
its
brighter
side
women
will
then
be
no
longer
able
to
wear
hats
to
adorn
which
the
most
beautiful
of
earth
creatures
have
been
ruthlessly
slaughtered
and
therefore
faith
in
them
will
begin
once
more
to
revive
faith
in
woman
we
know
is
a
very
important
thing
a
nation
that
has
once
lost
it
must
either
get
it
again
or
go
rapidly
downhill
how
much
better
therefore
to
get
it
again
i
had
meant
in
this
last
chapter
besides
touching
a
little
more
fully
on
some
points
to
which
i
have
here
and
there
referred
to
say
something
about
the
heron
nightjar
cuckoo

and
a
few
other
birds
but
i
have
managed
so
clumsily
that
i
now
find
myself
at
the
furthest
possible
limit
of
space
without
having
left
myself
room
either
for
the
one
or
the
other
with
regard
to
the
nightjar
i
have
kept
an
observational

of

birds

was

it
is
too
late

begin
now
all
these
birds
therefore
must
wait
a
little

i
will
not
forget

i
