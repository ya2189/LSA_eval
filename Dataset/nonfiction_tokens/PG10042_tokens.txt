preface
the
educator
has
been
designed
to
give
considered
expositions
of
the
best
theory
and
practice
in
english
education
of
it
is
planned
to
cover
the
principal
problems
of
educational
theory
in
general
of
curriculum
and
organisation
of
some
unexhausted
aspects
of
the
history
of
education
and
of
special
branches
of
applied
education
the
editor
and
his
colleagues
have
had
in
view
the
needs
of
young
teachers
and
of
those
training
to
be
teachers
but
since
the
school
and
the
schoolmaster
are
not
the
sole
factors
in
the
educative
process
it
is
hoped
that
educators
in
general
and
which
of
us
is
not
in
some
sense
or
other
an
educator
as
well
as
the
professional
schoolmaster
may
find
in
the
series
some
help
in
understanding
precept
and
practice
in
education
of
and
for
we
have
borne
in
mind
not
only
what
is
but
what
ought
to
be
to
exhibit
the
educator
work
as
a
vocation
requiring
the
best
possible
preparation
is
the
spirit
in
which
these
volumes
have
been
written
no
artificial
uniformity
has
been
sought
or
imposed
and
while
the
editor
is
responsible
for
the
series
in
general
the
responsibility
for
the
opinions
expressed
in
each
volume
rests
solely
with

preface
we
have
made
this
book
between
us
but
we
have
not
collaborated
we
know
that
we
agree
in
all
essentials
though
our
experience
has
differed
we
both
desire
to
see
the
best
conditions
for
development
provided
for
all
children
irrespective
of
class
we
both
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
conditions
of
the
public
elementary
school
from
the
nursery
school
up
will
be
such
in
point
of
numbers
in
freedom
from
pressure
in
situation
of
building
in
space
both
within
and
without
and
in
beauty
of
surroundings
that
parents
of
any
class
will
gladly
let
their
children
attend
it
we
are
teachers
and
we
have
dealt
mainly
with
the
mental
or
as
we
prefer
to
call
it
the
spiritual
requirements
of
children
it
is
from
the
medical
profession
that
we
must
all
accept
facts
about
food
values
hours
of
sleep
and
the
importance
of
cleanliness
and
fresh
air
are
now
fully
recognised
we
do
however
feel
that
there
is
room
for
fresh
discussion
of
ultimate
aims
and
of
daily
procedure
clutton
brock
has
said
that
the
great
weakness
of
english
education
is
the
want
of
a
definite
aim
to
put
before
our
children
the
want
of
a
philosophy
for
ourselves
without
some
understanding
of
life
and
its
purpose
or
meaning
the
teacher
is
at
the
mercy
of
every
fad
and
is
apt
to
exalt
method
above
principle
this
book
is
an
attempt
to
gather
together
certain
recognised
principles
and
to
show
in
the
light
of
actual
experience
how
these
may
be
applied
to
existing
circumstances
the
day
is
coming
when
all
teachers
will
seek
to
understand
the
true
value
of
play
of
spontaneous
activity
in
all
directions
its
importance
is
emphasised
in
nearly
all
the
educational
writings
of
the
day
as
well
in
the
senior
as
in
the
junior
departments
of
the
school
but
we
need
a
full
and
deep
understanding
of
the
saying
man
is
man
only
when
he
plays
it
is
easy
to
say
we
believe
it
but
it
needs
strong
faith
courage
and
wide
intelligence
to
weave
such
belief
into
the
warp
of
daily
life

what
in
a
name
it
is
an
appropriate
time
to
produce
a
book
on
english
schools
for
little
children
now
that
nursery
schools
have
been
specially
selected
for
notice
and
encouragement
by
an
enlightened
minister
for
education
it
was
madame
michaelis
who
in
originally
and
most
appropriately
used
the
term
nursery
school
as
the
english
equivalent
of
a
title
suggested
by
froebel
for
his
new
institution
before
he
invented
the
word
kindergarten
a
title
which
literally
translated
ran
institution
for
the
care
of
little
children
footnote
froebel
trans
michaelis
and
moore
p
in
england
the
word
nursery
which
implies
the
idea
of
nurture
belongs
properly
to
children
though
it
has
been
borrowed
by
the
gardener
for
his
young
plants
in
germany
it
was
the
other
way
round
froebel
had
to
invent
the
term
to
express
his
idea
of
the
nurture
as
opposed
to
the
repression
of
the
essential
nature
of
the
child
unfortunately
the
word
kindergarten
while
being
naturalised
in
england
had
two
distinct
meanings
attached
to
it
people
began
to
send
their
children
to
a
new
institution
a
child
garden
or
play
school
the
children
of
the
people
however
already
attended
infant
schools
of
which
the
chief
feature
was
what
caldwell
cook
calls
and
here
the
word
kindergarten
really
equivalent
to
nursery
school
became
identified
with
certain
occupations
childlike
in
origin
it
is
true
but
formalised
out
of
all
recognition
how
a
real
kindergarten
strikes
a
child
is
illustrated
by
the
recent
remark
from
a
little
new
boy
who
had
been
with
us
for
perhaps
three
mornings
shall
i
go
up
to
the
nursery
now
he
asked
the
first
attempt
at
a
kindergarten
was
made
in
and
by
germany
possessed
sixteen
in
that
eventful
year
came
the
revolution
in
berlin
which
created
such
high
hopes
doomed
alas
to
disappointment
instead
of
the
rosy
dawn
of
freedom
writes
ebers
himself
an
old
keilhau
boy
in
the
state
the
exercise
of
a
boundless
arbitrary
power
in
the
church
dark
intolerance
it
must
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
bring
charges
of
revolutionary
doctrines
against
the
man
who
said
so
innocently
but
i
i
only
wanted
to
train
up
independent
men
footnote
author
of
egyptian
etc
it
was
from
stony
berlin
as
froebel
calls
it
that
the
edict
went
forth
in
the
name
of
the
minister
of
education
entirely
prohibiting
kindergartens
in
prussia
and
the
prohibition
soon
spread
at
the
present
time
it
seems
to
us
quite
fitting
that
the
bitter
attack
upon
kindergartens
should
have
been
launched
by
folsung
a
schoolmaster
who
began
life
as
an
artilleryman
nor
is
it
less
interesting
to
read
that
it
was
under
the
protection
of
von
moltke
himself
that
oberlin
schools
were
opened
to
counteract
the
attractions
of
the
godless
kindergarten
little
wonder
that
the
same
man
who
in
had
so
gladly
taken
up
arms
to
resist
the
invasion
of
napoleon
and
who
had
rejoiced
with
such
enthusiasm
in
the
prospect
of
a
free
and
united
fatherland
should
write
in
wherefore
i
have
made
a
firm
resolve
that
if
the
conditions
of
german
life
will
not
allow
room
for
the
development
of
honest
efforts
for
the
good
of
humanity
if
this
indifference
to
all
higher
things
continues
then
it
is
my
purpose
next
spring
to
seek
in
the
land
of
union
and
independence
a
soil
where
my
idea
of
education
may
strike
deep
root
and
to
america
he
might
have
gone
had
he
lived
but
he
died
three
months
later
his
end
hastened
by
grief
at
the
edict
which
closed
the
kindergartens
the
prussian
minister
announced
in
this
edict
that
it
is
evident
that
kindergartens
form
a
part
of
the
froebelian
socialistic
system
the
aim
of
which
is
to
teach
the
children
atheism
and
the
suggestion
that
he
was
cut
the
old
man
to
the
heart
there
had
been
some
confusion
between
froebel
and
one
of
his
nephews
who
had
democratic
leanings
and
no
doubt
anything
at
all
democratic
did
mean
atheism
to
stony
berlin
and
its
intolerant
autocracy
for
a
time
at
least
in
bavaria
a
curious
compromise
was
allowed
if
the
teacher
were
a
member
of
the
orthodox
church
she
might
have
her
kindergarten
but
if
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
free
churches
it
was
permissible
to
open
an
infant
school
but
she
must
not
use
the
term
kindergarten
froebel
was
by
no
means
of
the
opinion
that
if
only
the
teacher
had
the
right
spirit
the
name
did
not
matter
rather
did
he
hold
with
confucius
whose
answer
to
the
question
of
a
disciple
how
shall
i
convert
the
world
was
call
things
by
their
right
names
he
refused
to
use
the
word
school
because
little
children
especially
those
under
six
do
not
need
to
be
schooled
and
taught
what
they
need
is
opportunity
for
development
he
had
great
difficulty
in
selecting
a
name
those
originally
suggested
were
somewhat
cumbrous
for
the
promotion
of
spontaneous
activity
in
another
was
and
there
was
also
the
one
which
madame
michaelis
translated
school
for
little
but
the
name
kindergarten
expressed
just
what
he
wanted
as
in
a
garden
under
god
favour
and
by
the
care
of
a
skilled
intelligent
gardener
growing
plants
are
cultivated
in
accordance
with
laws
so
here
in
our
child
garden
shall
the
noblest
of
all
growing
things
men
that
is
children
be
cultivated
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
their
own
being
of
god
and
of
nature
to
one
of
his
students
he
writes
you
remember
well
enough
how
hard
we
worked
and
how
we
had
to
fight
that
we
might
elevate
the
darmstadt
crèche
or
rather
infant
school
by
improved
methods
and
organisation
until
it
became
a
true
kindergarten
now
what
was
the
outcome
of
all
this
even
during
my
own
stay
at
darmstadt
why
the
fetters
which
always
cripple
a
crèche
or
an
infant
school
and
which
seem
to
cling
round
its
very
name
these
fetters
were
allowed
to
remain
unbroken
every
one
was
pleased
with
so
faithful
a
mistress
as
yourself
yet
they
withheld
from
you
the
main
condition
of
unimpeded
development
that
of
the
freedom
necessary
to
every
young
healthy
and
vigorous
plant
is
there
really
such
importance
underlying
the
mere
name
of
a
system
some
one
might
ask
yes
there
is
it
is
true
that
any
one
watching
your
teaching
would
observe
new
infused
into
it
and
fulfilling
the
child
own
wants
and
you
would
strike
him
as
personally
capable
but
you
would
fail
to
strike
him
as
priestess
of
the
idea
which
god
has
now
called
to
life
within
bosom
and
of
the
struggle
towards
the
realisation
of
that
idea
by
development
the
destined
means
of
raising
the
whole
human
race
no
man
can
acquire
fresh
knowledge
even
at
a
school
beyond
the
measure
which
his
own
stage
of
development
fits
him
to
receive
infant
schools
are
nothing
but
a
contradiction
of
little
children
especially
those
under
school
age
ought
not
to
be
schooled
and
taught
what
they
need
is
opportunity
for
development
this
idea
lies
in
the
very
name
of
a
kindergarten
and
the
name
is
absolutely
necessary
to
describe
the
first
education
of
children
for
an
actual
definition
of
what
froebel
meant
by
his
nursery
school
for
little
children
or
kindergarten
it
is
only
fair
to
go
to
the
founder
himself
he
has
left
us
two
definitions
or
descriptions
one
announced
shortly
before
the
first
kindergarten
was
opened
which
runs
an
institution
for
the
fostering
of
human
life
through
the
cultivation
of
the
human
instincts
of
activity
of
investigation
and
of
construction
in
the
child
as
a
member
of
the
family
of
the
nation
and
of
humanity
an
institution
for
the
and
of
mankind
as
well
as
for
development
of
the
individual
through
play
through
creative
and
spontaneous
a
second
definition
is
given
in
froebel
reply
to
a
proposal
that
he
should
establish
my
system
of
education
education
by
development
in
london
paris
or
the
united
states
we
also
need
establishments
for
training
quite
young
children
in
their
first
stage
of
educational
development
where
their
training
and
instruction
shall
be
based
upon
their
own
free
action
or
spontaneity
acting
under
proper
rules
these
rules
not
being
arbitrarily
decreed
but
such
as
must
arise
by
logical
necessity
from
the
child
mental
and
bodily
nature
regarding
him
as
a
member
of
the
great
human
family
such
rules
as
are
in
fact
discovered
by
the
actual
observation
of
children
when
associated
together
in
companies
these
establishments
bear
the
name
of
kindergartens
unfortunately
there
are
but
few
pictures
of
froebel
own
kindergarten
but
there
seems
to
have
been
little
formality
in
its
earliest
development
an
story
is
that
of
madame
von
marenholz
in
going
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
an
old
fool
as
the
villagers
called
him
who
played
games
with
the
village
children
a
less
account
is
given
by
von
arnswald
again
a
keilhau
boy
who
visited
blankenberg
in
when
froebel
had
just
opened
his
first
kindergarten
arriving
at
the
place
i
found
my
middendorf
seated
by
the
pump
in

surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
little
children
going
near
them
i
saw
that

was
engaged
in
mending
the
jacket
of
a
boy
by
his
side
sat
a
little
girl
busy
with
thread
and
needle
upon
another
piece
of
clothing
one
boy
had
his
feet
in
a
bucket
of
water
washing
them
carefully
other
girls
and
boys
were
standing
round
attentively
looking
upon
the
strange
pictures
of
real
life
before
them
and
waiting
for
something
to
turn
up
to
interest
them
personally
our
meeting
was
of
the
most
cordial
kind
but
middendorf
did
not
interrupt
the
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
children
he
cried
us
go
into
the
garden
and
with
loud
cries
of
joy
the
little
folk
with
willing
feet
followed
the
tall
man
running
all
round
him
footnote
one
of
froebel
most
devoted
helpers
the
garden
was
not
a
garden
however
but
a
barn
with
a
small
room
and
an
entrance
hall
in
the
entrance
middendorf
welcomed
the
children
and
played
a
round
game
with
them
ending
with
the
flight
of
the
little
ones
into
the
room
where
each
of
them
sat
down
in
his
place
on
the
bench
and
took
his
box
of
building
blocks
for
half
an
hour
they
were
all
busy
with
their
blocks
and
then
came

let
us
play

and
when
the
game
was
finished
they
went

full
of

every

hand
for

earliest
of
free
kindergartens
are
certain
essentials
washing
and
mending
the
alternation
of
constructive
play
with
active
exercise
rhythmic
game
and
song
and
last
but
not
least
human
kindliness
and
courtesy
the

a
barn
but
there
are
things
more
important
than
premises
froebel
died
too
soon
to
see
his
ideals
realised
but
he
had
sown
the
seed
in
the
heart
of
at
least
one
woman
with
brain
to
grasp
and
will
to
execute
as
early
as
the
froebelians
had
established
something
more
than
the
equivalent
of
the
montessori
children
houses
under
the
name
of
free
kindergartens
or
people
kindergartens
it
will
bring
this
out
more
clearly
if
without
referring
here
to
any
modern
experiments
in
america
in
england
and
scotland
or
in
the
dominions
we
quote
the
description
of
an
actual
people
kindergarten
or
nursery
school
as
it
was
established
nearly
fifty
years
ago
the
moving
spirit
of
this
institution
was
henrietta
schroder
own
trained
by
him
and
of
whom
he
said
that
she
more
than
any
other
had
most
truly
understood
his
views
the
whole
institution
was
called
the
house
the
prussian
edict
which
abolished
the
kindergarten
almost
before
it
had
started
was
now
rescinded
and
our
own
princess
royal
gave
warm
support
to
this
new
institution
the
description
here
quoted
was
actually
written
in
when
the
institution
had
been
in
existence
for
fourteen
years

the
purpose
of

is
to
provide
the
necessary
and
natural
help
which
poor
mothers
require
who
have
to
leave
their
children

may
receive
assistance

with

with

children
find
in

every
encouragement
to
develop
their
capabilities
and
powers
by
use
not
by
their
selfish
use
to
their
own
personal
advantage
but
by
their
use
in
the
loving
service
of
others
the
longing
to
help
people
and
to
accomplish
little
pieces
of
work
proportioned
to
their
feeble
powers
is
constant
in
children
and
lies
alongside
of
their
need
for
that
free
and
unrestrained
play
which
is
the
business
of
their
life
footnote
from
certain
old
photographs
i
suppose
this
to
have
been
what
we
now
call
a
kindergarten
band
the
elder
children
are
expected
to
employ
themselves
in
cleaning
taking
care
of
arranging
keeping
in
order
and
using
the
many
various
things
belonging
to
the
housekeeping
department
of
the
kindergarten
for
example
they
set
out
and
clear
away
the
materials
required
for
the
games
and
handicrafts
they
help
in
cleaning
the
rooms
furniture
and
utensils
they
keep
all
things
in
order
and
cleanliness
they
paste
together
torn
wallpapers
or
pictures
they
cover
books
and
they
help
in
the
cooking
and
in
preparations
for
it
in
laying
the
tables
in
washing
up
the
plates
and
dishes
etc
the
children
gain
in
this
manner
the
simple
but
most
important
foundations
of
their
later
duties
as
housekeepers
and
householders
and
at
the
same
time
learn
to
regard
these
duties
as
things
done
in
the
service
of
others
it
is
worth
while
to
notice
the
order
in
which
the
necessities
of
this
place
are
described
first
comes
a
kitchen
and
next
a
bathroom
then
an
playground
with
abundant
material
for
gaining
ideas
through
action
sand
pebbles
moss
shells
and
straw
then
comes
the
garden
and
only
after
all
these
the
rooms
and
halls
for
indoors
games
handwork
and
instruction
it
is
worth
while
also
to
note
the
prominence
given
to
play
music
poetry
and
pictures
domestic
occupations
and
gardening
all
preceding
the
systematic
and
ordered
occupations
which
to
some
have
seemed
so
if
we
compare
this
with
the
current
ideas
about
nursery
schools
we
do
not
find
that
it
falls
much
below
the
present
ideal
there
has
been
a
time
when
some
of
us
feared
that
only
the
bodily
needs
of
the
little
child
were
to
be
considered
but
the
regulations
for
nursery
schools
have
banished
such
fear
in
these
the
child
is
regarded
as
a
human
being
with
spiritual
as
well
as
bodily
requirements
to
put
it
shortly
the
physical
requirements
of
a
child
are
food
fresh
air
and
exercise
cleanliness
and
rest
it
is
not
so
easy
to
sum
up
the
requirements
of
a
human
soul
the
first
is
sympathy
and
though
this
may
spring
from
parental
instinct
it
should
be
nourished
by
true
understanding
next
perhaps
comes
the
need
for
material
material
for
investigation
for
admiration
for
imitation
and
for
construction
or
creation
power
of
is
important
enough
but
in
this
case
if
we
take
care
of
the
pounds
of
admiration
and
investigation
the
pence
of
will
take
care
of
themselves
besides
these
the
child
has
the
essentially
human
need
for
social
intercourse
for
speech
for
games
for
songs
and
stories
for
pictures
and
poetry
he
must
have
opportunity
both
to
imitate
and
to
share
in
the
work
and
life
around
him
he
must
be
an
individual
among
other
individuals
a
necessary
part
of
a
whole
allowed
to
give
as
well
as
to
receive
service
in
the
national
kindergarten
of
no
one
of
these
requirements
is
overlooked
except
the
provision
for
sleep
and
from
old
photographs
we
know
that
this
too
was
considered
nursery
schools
are
needed
for
children
of
all
classes
it
is
not
only
the
children
of
the
poor
who
require
sympathy
and
guidance
from
those
specially
qualified
by
real
grasp
of
the
facts
of
mothers
too
often
leave
their
children
to
ignorant
and
untrained
servants
or
to
the
equally
untrained
and
hardly
less
ignorant
nursery
governess
mothers
in
small
houses
have
much
to
do
making
beds
and
washing
dishes
sweeping
and
dusting
baking
and
cooking
making
and
mending
not
to
mention
tending
an
infant
or
tending
the
sick
leave
little
leisure
for
sympathy
with
the
adventuring
and
investigating
propensities
natural
and
desirable
in
a
healthy
child
between
three
and
five
there
are
innumerable
kindergartens
open
only
in
the
morning
for
the
children
of
those
who
can
afford
to
pay
and
these
could
well
be
multiplied
and
assisted
just
as
far
as
is
necessary
in
towns
at
least
mothers
with
but
small
incomes
would
gladly
pay
a
moderate
fee
to
have
their
little
ones
especially
their
sturdy
little
boys
guarded
from
danger
and
trained
to
good
habits
yet
allowed
freedom
for
happy
activity
kindergartens
and
nursery
schools
ought
to
be
as
much
as
possible
schools
they
should
never
be
large
or
the
home
atmosphere
must
disappear
they
should
always
have
grassy
spaces
and
common
flowers
and
they
ought
to
be
within
easy
reach
of
the
children
homes
there
must
for
the
present
be
certain
differences
between
the
free
kindergarten
or
nursery
school
for
the
poor
and
for
those
whose
parents
are
fairly
in
both
cases
we
must
supply
what
the
children
need
if
the
mother
must
go
out
to
work
the
child
requires
a
home
for
the
day
and
the
nursery
school
must
make
arrangements
for
feeding
the
children
all
little
children
are
the
better
for
rest
and
if
possible
for
sleep
during
the
day
but
for
those
who
live
in
overcrowded
rooms
where
quiet
and
restful
sleep
in
good
air
is
impossible
the
need
for
daily
sleep
is
very
great
all
free
kindergartens
arrange
for
this
most
important
also
is
the
training
to
cleanliness
this
is
not
invariably
the
lot
even
of
those
who
come
from
apparently
comfortable
homes
to
attend
kindergartens
and
among
the
poor
differences
in
respect
of
cleanliness
are
very
great
but
soap
and
hot
water
do
cost
money
and
washing
takes
time
and
the
modern
habit
of
brushing
teeth
has
not
yet
been
acquired
by
all
classes
of
the
community
the
free
kindergartens
provide
for
necessary
washing
each
child
is
provided
with
its
own
and
drill
is
a
daily
practice
somewhat
amusing
to
witness
the
best
baby
rooms
in
our
infant
schools
carry
out
the
same
practices
and
these
are
likely
to
be
turned
into
nursery
schools
it
can
not
yet
be
accepted
as
conclusively
proved
that
a
completely
life
is
the
best
in
our
climate
we
have
not
yet
sufficient
statistics
no
doubt
children
do
improve
enormously
in
camps
but
so
they
do
in
ordinary
nursery
schools
where
they
are
clean
happy
and
well
fed
and
where
they
live
a
regular
life
with
daily
sleep
housing
conditions
complicate
the
problem
and
all
children
must
suffer
who
sleep
in
crowded
noisy
unventilated
rooms
up
to
the
present
time
nursery
schools
have
been
provided
by
voluntary
effort
entirely
and
far
too
little
encouragement
has
been
given
to
those
enlightened
headmistresses
of
infant
schools
who
have
tried
to
give
to
their
lowest
classes
nursery
school
conditions
since
the
passing
of
fisher
education
bill
however
we
are
entitled
to
hope
that
soon
for
all
children
in
the
land
there
may
be
the
opportunity
of
a
fair
start
under
the
care
of
a
person
with
breadth
of
outlook
and
imagination
the
equivalent

in

an
attempt
is
made
to
explain
how
it
is
that
so
many
years

froebel
reached
his
vision
of
what
a
child
is
and
of
what
a
child
needs

on
which

would
recognise
this
as
the
description
of
a
more
or
less
ideal
kindergarten
or
nursery
school
and
yet
the
writer
had
probably
never
read
a
page
that
froebel
wrote
on
the
contrary
she
shows
her
entire
ignorance
of
the
real
kindergarten
by
calling
it
pretty
employments
devised
by
adults
and
imposed
at
set
times
by
authority
the
description
is
taken
from
a
very
able
address
on
child
nature
and
education
delivered
some
years
ago
by
miss
hoskyns
abrahall
it
is
quoted
here
because
for
her
conception
of
right
surroundings
for
young
children
the
speaker
has
gone
to
the
very
source
from
which
froebel
took
his
ideas
she
has
gone
to
what
froebel
indeed
called
the
only
true
source
life
itself
and
she
writes
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
biologist
there
exists
at
present
in
certain
quarters
a
belief
that
the
kindergarten
is
out
of
date
more
especially
that
it
has
no
scientific
basis
it
is
partly
on
this
account
that
the
ideas
of
maria
montessori
who
has
approached
the
question
of
the
education
of
young
children
from
the
point
of
view
of
medical
science
have
been
warmly
welcomed
by
so
large
a
circle
but
neither
in
england
nor
in
america
does
that
circle
include
the
froebelians
and
this
for
several
reasons
for
one
thing
much
that
the
general
public
has
accepted
as
new
and
in
this
general
public
must
be
included
weighty
names
men
of
science
educational
authorities
and
others
who
have
never
troubled
to
inquire
into
the
meaning
of
the
kindergarten
are
already
matters
of
everyday
life
to
the
froebelian
among
these
comes
the
idea
of
training
to
service
for
the
community
and
the
provision
of
suitable
furniture
little
chairs
and
tables
which
the
children
can
move
about
and
low
cupboards
for
materials
all
of
which
tend
to
independence
and
it
is
a
more
serious
to
the
froebelian
that
montessori
while
advocating
freedom
in
words
has
really
set
strict
limits
to
the
natural
activities
of
children
by
laying
so
much
stress
on
her
didactic
apparatus
the
intention
of
which
is
formal
training
in
this
material
which
is
an
adaptation
and
enlargement
of
that
provided
by
séguin
for
his
mentally
deficient
children
is
certainly
open
to
the
reproach
of
having
been
devised
by
adults
it
is
formal
and
the
child
is
not
permitted
to
use
it
for
his
own
purposes
before
everything
else
however
comes
the
fact
that
in
no
place
has
montessori
shown
that
she
has
made
any
study
of
play
or
that
she
attaches
special
importance
to
the
play
activities
or
natural
activities
of
childhood
on
which
the
kindergarten
is
founded
this
is
probably
accounted
for
in
that
her
first
observations
were
made
on
deficient
children
who
are
notably
wanting
in
initiative
among
these
play
activities
we
should
include
the
child
perpetual
imitation
or
pretence
a
matter
which
montessori
entirely
fails
to
understand
as
shown
in
her
more
recent
book
where
she
treats
of
imagination
here
she
maintains
that
only
the
children
of
the
comparatively
poor
ride
upon
their
fathers
or
construct
coaches
of
chairs
that
this
is
not
a
proof
of
imagination
but
of
an
unsatisfied
desire
and
that
rich
children
who
own
ponies
and
who
drive
out
in
would
be
astonished
to
see
the
delight
of
children
who
imagine
themselves
to
be
drawn
along
by
stationary
armchairs
imitative
play
has
of
course
nothing
to
do
with
poverty
or
riches
but
is
as
froebel
said
long
since
the
outcome
of
an
initiative
impulse
sadly
wanting
in
deficient
children
an
impulse
which
prompts
the
child
of
all
lands
of
all
time
and
of
all
classes
to
imitate
or
dramatise
and
so
to
gain
some
understanding
of
everything
and
of
every
person
he
sees
around
the
work
of
montessori
has
helped
enormously
in
the
movement
begun
long
since
for
greater
freedom
in
our
infant
schools
freedom
not
from
judicious
guidance
and
authority
but
from
rigid
and
formal
lessons
and
from
arbitrary
restrictions
as
well
as
freedom
for
the
individual
as
apart
from
the
class
the
best
kindergartens
and
infant
schools
had
already
discarded
and
kindergarten
classes
have
always
been
small
enough
to
give
the
individual
a
fair
chance
froebel
himself
constantly
urged
that
the
child
should
become
familiar
with
both
the
strongly
opposed
elements
of
his
life
the
individual
determining
and
directing
side
and
the
general
ordered
and
subordinated
side
he
urged
the
early
development
of
the
social
consciousness
as
well
as
insisting
on
expansion
of
individuality
but
it
is
always
difficult
to
combine
the
two
and
most
kindergarten
teachers
will
benefit
by
learning
from
montessori
to
apply
the
method
of
individual
learning
to
a
greater
extent
we
are
however
fully
prepared
to
maintain
that
froebel
even
in
had
a
wider
and
a
deeper
realisation
of
the
needs
of
the
child
than
has
as
yet
been
attained
by
the
dottoressa
in
order
to
make
this
clear
it
is
proposed
to
compare
the
theories
of
froebel
with
the
conclusions
of
a
biologist
for
biology
has
a
wider
and
a
saner
outlook
than
medical
science
it
does
not
start
from
the
abnormal
but
with
life
under
normal
conditions
footnote
her
latest
publication
regarding
the
instruction
for
it
is
not
education
of
older
children
makes
this
even
more
plain
for
here
is
no
discussion
of
what
children
at
this
stage
require
but
a
mere
plunge
into
subjects
in
which
formal
grammar
takes
a
foremost
place
in
the
address
from
which
the
opening
words
of
this
chapter
are
quoted
it
is
suggested
that
a
capable
biologist
be
set
to
deal
with
education
but
he
is
to
be
freed
from
all
preconceived
ideas
derived
from
accepted
tradition
after
such
fundamentals
as
food
and
warmth
light
air
and
sleep
the
first
problems
considered
by
this
biologist
educator
are
stages
of
growth
their
appropriate
activities
and
the
stimuli
necessary
to
evoke
them
always
he
bears
in
mind
that
interference
with
a
growing
creature
is
a
hazardous
business
and
takes
as
his
motto
when
in
doubt
refrain
to
discover
the
natural
activities
of
the
child
the
biologist
relies
upon
first
observation
of
the
child
himself
secondly
upon
his
knowledge
of
the
nervous
system
and
thirdly
upon
his
knowledge
of
the
past
history
of
the
race
from
these
he
comes
to
a
very
pertinent
conclusion
viz
the
general
outcome
of
this
is
that
the
safe
way
of
educating
children
is
by
means
of
play
play
being
defined
as
the
natural
manifestation
of
the
child
activities
systematic
in
that
it
follows
the
lines
of
physiological
development
but
without
the
hard
and
fast
routine
of
the
footnote
it
is
in
this
connection
that
the
kindergarten
is
stigmatised
as
pretty
employments
devised
by
adults
and
imposed
at
set
times
by
authority
an
opinion
evidently
gained
from
the
way
in
which
the
term
has
been
misused
in
a
type
of
infant
school
now
fast
disappearing
it
is
easy
to
show
that
although
froebel
was
he
had
been
in
close
touch
with
scientists
who
were
working
at
theories
of
development
and
that
he
was
largely
influenced
by
krause
who
applied
the
idea
of
organic
development
to
all
departments
of
social
science
it
was
because
froebel
was
himself
even
in
the
biologist
educator
desiring
to
break
with
preconceived
ideas
and
traditions
that
he
wished
one
of
his
pupils
had
been
able
to
call
your
work
by
its
proper
name
and
so
make
evident
the
real
nature
of
the
new
spirit
you
have
introduced
footnote
see
p
but
froebel
was
more
than
a
biologist
he
was
a
philosopher
and
an
idealist
such
words
have
sometimes
been
used
as
terms
of
reproach
but
wisdom
can
only
be
justified
of
her
children
at
the
back
of
all
froebel
has
to
say
about
the
education
of
the
human
being
lies
his
conception
of
what
the
human
being
is
and
it
is
impossible
fully
to
understand
why
froebel
laid
so
much
stress
on
spontaneous
play
unless
we
go
deeper
than
the
province
of
the
biologist
without
in
the
least
minimising
the
importance
of
biological
knowledge
to
educational
theory
as
the
biologist
defines
play
as
the
natural
manifestation
of
the
child
activities
so
froedel
says
play
at
first
is
just
natural
life
but
to
him
the
true
inwardness
of
spontaneous
play
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
spontaneous
so
far
as
anything
in
the
universe
can
be
spontaneous
for
spontaneous
response
to
environment
is
and
out
of
comes
selfhood
consciousness
of
self
if
we
are
to
understand
froebel
at
all
we
must
begin
with
the
answer
he
found
or
accepted
from
krause
and
others
for
his
first
question
what
is
that
self
before
reaching
the
question
of
how
to
educate
it
seemed
to
him
necessary
to
consider
not
only
the
purpose
or
aim
of
education
but
the
purpose
or
aim
of
human
existence
the
purpose
of
all
and
any
existence
even
whether
there
is
any
purpose
in
anything
and
that
brings
us
to
what
he
calls
the
groundwork
of
all
of
which
a
summary
is
given
in
the
following
paragraphs
in
the
universe
we
can
perceive
plan
purpose
or
law
and
behind
this
there
must
be
some
great
mind
a
living
energising
and
hence
eternal
unity
whom
we
call
god
nature
and
all
existing
things
are
a
revelation
of
god
as
bergson
speaks
of
the
which
expresses
itself
from
infinity
to
infinity
so
froebel
says
that
behind
everything
there
is
force
and
that
we
can
not
conceive
of
force
without
matter
on
which
it
can
exercise
itself
neither
can
we
think
of
matter
without
any
force
to
work
upon
it
so
that
force
and
matter
mutually
condition
one
another
we
can
not
think
one
without
the
other
this
force
expresses
itself
in
all
ways
the
whole
universe
is
the
expression
of
the
divine
but
man
is
the
highest
and
most
perfect
earthly
being
in
whom
the
primordial
force
is
spiritualised
so
that
man
feels
understands
and
knows
his
own
power
conscious
development
of
one
own
power
is
the
triumph
of
spirit
over
matter
therefore
human
development
is
spiritual
development
so
while
man
is
the
most
perfect
earthly
being
yet
with
regard
to
spiritual
development
he
has
returned
to
a
first
stage
and
must
raise
himself
through
ascending
degrees
of
consciousness
to
heights
as
yet
unknown
for
who
has
measured
the
limits
of
mankind
is
the
special
characteristic
of
man
no
other
animal
has
the
power
to
become
conscious
of
himself
because
man
alone
has
the
chance
of
failure
the
lower
animals
have
definite
instincts
and
can
not
fail
can
not
learn
man
wants
to
do
much
but
his
instincts
are
less
definite
and
most
actions
have
to
be
learned
it
is
by
striving
and
failing
that
he
learns
to
know
not
only
his
limitations
but
the
power
that
is
within
him
his
self
footnote
this
would
nowadays
be
considered
too
sweeping
an
assertion
according
to
froebel
the
aim
of
education
is
the
steady
progressive
development
of
mankind
there
is
and
can
be
no
other
and
except
as
regards
physiological
knowledge
inaccessible
in
his
day
he
is
at
one
with
the
biologist
as
to
how
we
are
to
find
out
the
course
of
this
development
first
by
looking
into
our
own
past
secondly
by
the
observation
of
children
as
individuals
as
well
as
when
associated
together
and
by
comparison
of
the
results
of
observation
thirdly
by
comparison
of
these
with
race
history
and
race
development
froebel
makes
much
of
observation
of
children
he
writes
to
a
cousin
begging
her
to
record
in
writing
the
most
important
facts
about
each
separate
child
and
adds
that
it
seems
to
him
most
necessary
for
the
comprehension
of
that
such
observations
should
be
made
public
of
the
greatest
importance
that
we
should
interchange
the
observations
we
make
so
that
little
by
little
we
may
come
to
know
the
grounds
and
conditions
of
what
we
observe
that
we
may
formulate
their
laws
he
protests
that
even
in
his
day
the
observation
development
and
guidance
of
children
in
the
first
years
of
life
up
to
the
proper
age
of
school
is
not
up
to
the
existing
level
of
the
stage
of
human
knowledge
or
the
advance
of
science
and
art
and
he
states
that
it
is
an
essential
part
of
his
undertaking
to
call
into
life
institution
for
the
preparation
of
teachers
trained
for
the
care
of
children
through
observation
of
their
in
speaking
of
the
stages
of
development
of
the
individual
froebel
says
that
there
is
no
order
of
importance
in
the
stages
of
human
development
except
the
order
of
succession
in
which
the
earlier
is
always
the
more
important
and
from
that
point
of
view
we
ought
to
consider
childhood
as
the
most
important
stage
a
stage
in
the
development
of
the
godlike
in
the
earthly
and
human
he
also
emphasises
that
the
vigorous
and
complete
development
and
cultivation
of
each
successive
stage
depends
on
the
vigorous
complete
and
characteristic
development
of
each
and
all
preceding
stages
so
the
duty
of
the
parent
is
to
look
as
deeply
as
possible
into
the
life
of
the
child
to
see
what
he
requires
for
his
present
stage
of
development
and
then
to
scrutinise
the
environment
to
see
what
it
offers
to
utilise
all
possibilities
of
meeting
normal
needs
to
remove
what
is
hurtful
or
at
least
to
admit
its
defects
if
they
can
not
give
the
child
what
his
nature
requires
if
parents
offer
what
the
child
does
not
need
he
says
they
will
destroy
the
child
faith
in
their
sympathetic
understanding
the
educator
is
to
bring
the
child
into
relations
and
surroundings
in
all
respects
adapted
to
him
but
affording
a
minimum
of
opportunity
of
injury
guarding
and
protecting
but
not
interfering
unless
he
is
certain
that
healthy
development
has
already
been
interrupted
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
froebel
anticipated
even
the
conclusions
of
modern
in
his
views
about
childish
faults
the
sources
of
these
he
says
are
neglect
to
develop
certain
sides
of
human
life
and
secondly
early
distortion
of
originally
good
human
powers
by
arbitrary
interference
with
the
orderly
course
of
human
development
a
suppressed
or
perverted
good
quality
a
good
tendency
only
repressed
misunderstood
or
misguided
lies
at
the
bottom
of
every
shortcoming
hence
the
only
remedy
even
for
wickedness
is
to
find
and
foster
build
up
and
guide
what
has
been
repressed
it
may
be
necessary
to
interfere
and
even
to
use
severity
but
only
when
the
educator
is
sure
of
unhealthy
growth
the
motto
of
the
biologist
on
the
subject
of
interference
when
in
doubt
refrain
exactly
expresses
froebel
doctrine
of
passive
or
following
education
following
that
is
the
nature
of
the
child
and
passive
as
opposed
to
arbitrary
interference
free
from
this
the
child
will
follow
his
natural
impulses
which
are
to
be
trusted
as
much
as
those
of
any
other
young
animal
in
other
words
he
will
play
he
will
manifest
his
natural
activities
the
young
human
being
still
as
it
were
in
process
of
creation
would
seek
though
unconsciously
yet
decidedly
and
surely
as
a
product
of
nature
that
which
is
in
itself
best
and
in
a
form
adapted
to
his
condition
his
disposition
his
powers
and
his
means
thus
the
duckling
hastens
to
the
pond
and
into
the
water
while
the
chicken
scratches
the
ground
and
the
young
swallow
catches
its
food
upon
the
wing
we
grant
space
and
time
to
young
plants
and
animals
because
we
know
that
in
accordance
with
the
laws
that
live
in
them
they
will
develop
properly
and
grow
well
arbitrary
interference
with
their
growth
is
avoided
because
it
would
hinder
their
development
but
the
young
human
being
is
looked
upon
as
a
piece
of
wax
a
lump
of
clay
which
man
can
mould
into
what
he
pleases
o
man
who
roamest
through
garden
and
field
through
meadow
and
grove
why
dost
thou
close
thy
mind
to
the
silent
teaching
of
nature
behold
the
weed
grown
among
hindrances
and
constraint
how
it
scarcely
yields
an
indication
of
inner
law
behold
it
in
nature
in
field
or
garden
how
perfectly
it
conforms
to
law
a
beautiful
sun
a
radiant
star
it
has
burst
from
the
earth
thus
o
parents
could
your
children
on
whom
you
force
in
tender
years
forms
and
aims
against
their
nature
and
who
therefore
walk
with
you
in
morbid
and
unnatural
deformity
thus
could
your
children
too
unfold
in
beauty
and
develop
in
harmony
at
first
play
is
activity
for
the
sake
of
activity
not
for
the
sake
of
results
of
which
the
child
has
as
yet
no
idea
very
soon
however
having
man
special
capacity
of
learning
through
experience
the
child
does
gather
ideas
by
this
time
he
has
passed
through
the
stage
of
infancy
and
now
his
play
becomes
to
the
philosopher
the
highest
stage
of
human
development
at
this
stage
because
now
it
is
when
froebel
wrote
in
there
had
been
but
little
thought
expended
on
the
subject
of
play
and
probably
none
on
human
instincts
which
were
supposed
to
be
nonexistent
the
hope
he
expressed
that
some
philosopher
would
take
up
these
subjects
has
now
been
fulfilled
and
we
ought
now
to
turn
to
what
has
been
said
on
a
subject
to
those
who
desire
to
help
in
the
education
of
young
children
chapter
iii
learning
born
of
play
play
which
is
the
business
of
their
lives
there
may
be
nothing
new
under
the
sun
but
it
does
seem
to
be
a
fair
claim
to
make
for
froebel
that
no
one
before
or
since
his
time
has
more
fully
realised
the
value
to
humanity
of
what
in
childhood
goes
by
the
name
of
play
froebel
had
distinct
theories
about
play
and
he
put
his
theories
into
actual
practice
not
only
when
he
founded
the
kindergarten
but
in
his
original
school
for
older
children
at
keilhau
before
going
into
its
full
meaning
it
may
be
well
first
to
meet
the
most
common
misconception
about
play
it
is
not
surprising
that
those
who
have
given
the
subject
no
special
consideration
should
regard
play
from
the
ordinary
adult
standpoint
and
think
of
it
as
entirely
opposed
to
work
as
relaxation
of
effort
but
the
play
of
a
child
covers
so
much
that
it
is
startling
to
find
a
real
psychologist
writing
that
education
through
play
is
a
pernicious
proposition
statements
of
this
kind
spring
from
the
mistaken
idea
certainly
not
derived
from
observation
that
play
involves
no
effort
that
it
runs
in
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
that
education
through
play
means
therefore
education
without
effort
without
training
in
education
without
moral
training
the
case
for
the
kindergarten
is
the
opposite
of
this
education
through
play
is
advocated
just
because
of
the
effort
it
calls
forth
just
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
child
and
later
the
boy
or
girl
throws
his
whole
energy
into
it
what
froebel
admired
what
he
called
the
most
beautiful
expression
of
childlife
was
the
child
that
plays
thoroughly
with
spontaneous
determination
perseveringly
until
physical
fatigue
forbids
a
child
wholly
absorbed
in
his
play
a
child
that
has
fallen
asleep
while
so
absorbed
that
child
he
said
would
be
a
thorough
determined
man
capable
of
for
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
himself
and
others
it
is
because
play
is
not
trivial
but
highly
serious
and
of
deep
significance
that
he
appeals
to
mothers
to
cultivate
and
foster
it
and
to
fathers
to
protect
and
guard
it
footnote
educative
bagley
the
kindergarten
position
can
be
summed
up
in
a
sentence
from
clouston
of
play
is
the
real
work
of
children
froebel
calls
activity
of
sense
and
limb
the
first
germ
and
and
modelling
the
tender
blossoms
of
the
constructive
impulse
and
this
he
says
is
the
moment
when
man
is
to
be
prepared
for
future
industry
diligence
and
productive
activity
he
points
out
too
the
importance
of
noticing
the
habits
which
come
from
spontaneous
which
may
be
habits
of
indolent
ease
if
the
child
is
not
allowed
to
be
as
active
as
his
nature
requires
there
were
no
theories
of
play
in
froebel
day
but
he
had
certainly
read
and
in
all
probability
he
knew
what
schiller
had
said
in
his
on
aesthetic
the
play
theories
are
now
too
well
known
to
require
more
than
a
brief
recapitulation
it
will
generally
be
allowed
that
the
distinctive
feature
of
play
as
opposed
to
work
is
that
of
spontaneity
the
action
itself
is
of
no
consequence
one
man
play
is
another
man
work
nor
does
it
seem
to
matter
whence
comes
the
feeling
of
compulsion
in
work
whether
from
pressure
of
outer
necessity
or
from
an
inner
necessity
like
the
compelling
force
of
duty
where
there
is
joy
in
creation
or
in
discovery
the
work
and
play
of
the
genius
approach
the
standpoint
of
the
child
indulging
every
instinct
of
the
soul
there
where
law
life
joy
impulse
are
one
thing
in
the
play
of
early
childhood
there
may
be
freedom
not
only
from
adult
authority
but
even
from
the
restrictions
of
nature
or
of
circumstances
since
let
pretend
annihilates
time
and
space
and
all
material
considerations
among
theories
of
play
first
comes
what
is
known
as
the
theory
in
which
play
is
attributed
to
the
accumulation
of
surplus
energy
when
the
human
being
has
more
energy
than
he
requires
in
order
to
supply
the
bodily
needs
of
himself
and
his
family
then
he
feels
impelled
to
use
it
as
the
activities
of
his
daily
life
are
the
only
ones
known
to
him
he
fights
his
battles
over
again
he
simulates
the
serious
business
of
life
and
transfers
for
instance
the
incidents
of
the
chase
into
a
dance
in
this
way
he
reaches
artistic
creation
so
that
play
is
the
first
poetry
of
the
human
being
as
an
opposite
of
this
we
get
a
theory
where
play
if
not
too
strenuous
understood
as
a
change
of
occupation
rests
and
another
theory
is
that
of
recapitulation
which
has
been
emphasised
by
stanley
hall
according
to
which
children
play
hunting
and
chasing
games
or
find
a
fascination
in
making
tents
because
they
are
passing
through
that
stage
of
development
in
which
their
primitive
ancestors
lived
by
hunting
or
dwelt
in
tents
lastly
a
most
interesting
theory
is
that
which
is
associated
with
the
name
of
groos
and
which
is
best
expressed
in
the
sentence
animals
do
not
play
because
they
are
young
but
they
have
their
youth
because
they
must
play
play
being
regarded
as
the
preparation
for
future
life
activities
the
kitten
therefore
practises
chasing
a
cork
the
puppy
worries
boots
and
gloves
the
kid
practises
jumping
and
so
on
a
full
account
of
play
will
probably
embrace
all
these
theories
and
though
they
were
not
formulated
in
his
day
froebel
overlooked
none
though
he
may
have
laid
special
stress
on
the
preparation
side
yet
another
value
of
play
emphasised
by
professor
royce
viz
its
enormous
importance
from
the
point
of
view
of
mental
initiative
is
strongly
urged
by
froebel
professor
royce
argues
that
in
the
mere
persistence
of
the
playful
child
one
has
a
factor
whose
value
for
mental
initiative
it
is
hard
to
overestimate
without
this
passionately
persistent
repetition
and
without
also
the
constant
varying
of
apparently
useless
activities
the
organism
says
professor
royce
would
remain
the
prey
of
the
environment
to
froebel
as
we
have
seen
the
human
being
is
the
climax
of
animal
evolution
and
the
of
psychical
development
the
lower
animal
he
maintained
as
all
will
now
agree
is
hindered
by
his
definite
instincts
but
the
instincts
or
instinctive
tendencies
of
the
human
being
are
so
undefined
that
there
is
room
for
spontaneity
for
new
forms
of
conduct
professor
royce
says
that
a
general
view
of
the
place
which
beings
with
minds
occupy
in
the
physical
world
strongly
suggests
that
their
organisms
may
especially
have
significance
as
places
for
the
initiation
of
more
or
less
novel
types
of
activity
and
to
froebel
the
chief
significance
of
play
lies
in
this
spontaneity
play
is
the
highest
phase
of
human
development
at
this
stage
because
it
is
spontaneous
expression
of
what
is
within
produced
by
an
inner
necessity
and
impulse
play
is
the
most
characteristic
most
spiritual
manifestation
of
man
at
this
stage
and
at
the
same
time
is
typical
of
human
life
as
a
whole
these
various
theories
seem
to
reinforce
rather
than
to
contradict
each
other
and
it
is
more
important
to
avoid
running
any
to
an
extreme
than
to
differentiate
between
them
in
the
case
of
recapitulation
we
must
certainly
bear
in
mind
froebel
warning
that
the
child
should
be
treated
as
having
in
himself
the
present
past
and
future
so
as
drummond
says
if
we
feel
constrained
to
present
him
with
a
tent
because
abraham
lived
in
one
he
no
doubt
enters
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
accepts
it
joyfully
but
he
also
annexes
the
ball
of
string
and
the
coffee
canister
to
fit
up
telephonic
communication
with
the
nursery
he
may
play
robbers
and
hide
and
seek
because
he
has
reached
a
hunting
and
capture
stage
but
the
physiologist
points
out
that
violent
exercise
is
a
necessity
for
his
circulation
and
nutrition
and
to
practise
swift
flight
to
safety
is
useful
even
in
modern
times
gardening
may
take
us
back
to
an
agricultural
stage
but
digging
is
most
useful
as
a
muscular
exercise
and
watering
is
scientific
experiment
and
adds
to
the
feeling
of
power
while
the
flowers
themselves
appeal
to
the
aesthetic
side
of
the
which
is
not
limited
to
any
age
though
conspicuous
so
soon
footnote
an
riddle
asks
the
difference
between
the
quick
and
the
dead
and
answers
the
quick
are
those
who
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
and
the
dead
are
those
who
do
not
froebel
recognised
many
kinds
of
play
he
realised
that
much
of
the
play
of
boyhood
is
exercise
of
physical
power
and
that
it
must
be
of
a
competitive
nature
because
the
boy
wants
to
measure
his
power
even
in
he
urges
the
importance
not
only
of
town
playgrounds
but
of
play
leaders
that
the
play
may
be
full
of
life
among
games
for
boys
he
noted
some
still
involving
as
hiding
games
colour
games
and
shooting
at
a
mark
which
need
quick
hearing
and
sight
intellectual
plays
exercising
thought
and
judgement
draughts
and
dramatic
games
one
form
of
play
which
seemed
to
him
most
important
was
constructive
play
where
there
is
expression
of
ideas
as
well
as
expression
of
power
this
side
of
play
covers
a
great
deal
and
will
be
dealt
with
later
its
importance
in
froebel
eyes
lies
in
the
fact
that
through
construction
however
simple
the
child
gains
knowledge
of
his
own
power
and
learns
to
master
himself
froebel
wanted
particularly
to
deepen
this
feeling
of
power
and
says
that
the
little
one
who
has
already
made
some
experiments
takes
pleasure
in
the
use
of
sand
and
clay
impelled
by
the
previously
acquired
sense
of
power
he
seeks
to
master
the
material
in
order
to
gain
real
knowledge
of
himself
of
his
power
a
child
needs
to
compare
his
power
with
that
of
others
this
is
one
reason
for
the
child
ready
imitation
of
all
he
sees
done
by
others
another
reason
for
this
is
that
only
through
real
experience
or
action
can
a
child
gain
the
ideas
which
he
will
express
later
therefore
he
must
reproduce
all
he
sees
or
hears
in
the
family
the
child
sees
parents
and
others
at
work
producing
doing
something
consequently
he
at
this
stage
would
like
to
represent
what
he
sees
be
cautious
parents
you
can
at
one
blow
destroy
at
least
for
a
long
time
the
impulse
to
activity
and
to
formation
if
you
repel
their
help
as
childish
useless
or
even
as
a
hindrance
strengthen
and
develop
this
instinct
give
to
your
child
the
highest
he
now
needs
let
him
add
his
power
to
your
work
that
he
may
gain
the
consciousness
of
his
power
and
also
learn
to
appreciate
its
limitations
as
the
child
sense
of
power
and
his
deepen
he
requires
possessions
of
his
very
own
says
froebel
the
feeling
of
his
own
power
implies
and
demands
also
the
possession
of
his
own
space
and
his
own
material
belonging
exclusively
to
him
be
his
realm
his
province
a
corner
of
the
house
or
courtyard
be
it
the
space
of
a
box
or
of
a
closet
be
it
a
grotto
a
hut
or
a
garden
the
boy
at
this
age
needs
an
external
point
chosen
and
prepared
by
himself
to
which
he
refers
all
his
activity
as
ideas
widen
the
child
purposes
enlarge
and
he
finds
the
need
for
that
which
binds
human
beings
together
and
so
by
play
enjoyed
in
common
the
feeling
of
community
which
is
present
in
the
little
child
is
raised
to
recognition
of
the
rights
of
others
not
only
is
a
sense
of
justice
developed
but
also
forbearance
consideration
and
sympathy
when
the
room
to
be
filled
is
extensive
when
the
realm
to
be
controlled
is
large
when
the
whole
to
be
produced
is
complex
then
brotherly
union
of
persons
is
in
place
and
we
are
invited
to
enter
an
education
room
where
boys
of
seven
to
ten
are
using
building
blocks
sand
sawdust
and
green
moss
brought
in
from
the
forest
each
one
has
finished
his
work
and
he
examines
it
and
that
of
others
and
in
each
rises
the
desire
to
unite
all
in
one
whole
so
roads
are
made
from
the
village
of
one
boy
to
the
castle
of
another
the
boy
who
has
made
a
cardboard
house
unites
with
another
who
has
made
miniature
ships
from
the
house
as
a
castle
crowns
the
hill
and
the
ships
float
in
the
lake
below
while
the
youngest
brings
his
shepherd
and
sheep
to
graze
between
the
mountain
and
the
lake
and
all
stand
and
behold
with
pleasure
and
satisfaction
the
result
of
their
hands
the
educative
value
of
such
play
has
been
brought
forward
in
modern
times
in
by
wells
by
nesbit
and
notably
in
caldwell
cook
play
city
in
play
joining
together
for
a
common
purpose
does
not
only
belong
to
younger
boys
what
busy
tumult
among
those
older
boys
at
the
brook
they
have
built
canals
sluices
bridges
etc
at
each
step
one
trespasses
on
the
limits
of
another
realm
each
one
claims
his
right
as
lord
and
maker
while
he
recognises
the
claims
of
others
and
like
states
they
bind
themselves
by
strict
treaties
every
town
should
have
its
own
common
playground
for
the
boys
glorious
results
would
come
from
this
for
the
entire
community
for
at
this
period
games
whenever
possible
are
in
common
and
develop
the
feeling
and
desire
for
community
and
the
laws
and
requirements
of
community
the
boy
tries
to
see
himself
in
his
companions
to
weigh
and
measure
himself
by
them
to
know
and
find
himself
by
their
help
it
is
the
sense
of
sure
and
reliable
power
the
sense
of
its
increase
both
as
an
individual
and
as
a
member
of
the
group
that
fills
the
boy
with
joy
during
these
games
justice
loyalty
impartiality
who
could
fail
to
catch
their
fragrance
and
that
of
still
more
delicate
blossoms
forbearance
consideration
sympathy
and
encouragement
for
the
weaker
thus
the
games
educate
the
boy
for
life
and
awaken
and
cultivate
many
social
and
moral
virtues
in
england
we
have
always
had
respect
for
boys
games
and
more
and
more
especially
in
america
people
are
realising
the
need
for
play
places
and
play
leaders
but
all
this
was
written
in
when
for
ten
years
froebel
had
been
experimenting
with
boys
of
all
ages
at
keilhau
play
of
all
kinds
had
an
honoured
place
we
read
of
excursions
for
all
kinds
of
purposes
of
indian
games
out
of
fenimore
cooper
and
of
homeric
battles
it
was
part
of
froebel
plan
to
have
us
work
with
spade
and
and
every
boy
had
his
own
piece
of
ground
where
he
might
do
what
he
pleased
ebers
being
literary
constructed
in
his
plot
a
bed
of
heather
on
which
he
lay
and
read
or
made
verses
the
boys
built
their
own
stage
painted
their
own
scenery
and
in
winter
once
a
week
they
acted
classic
dramas
besides
this
there
was
a
large
and
complete
puppet
theatre
belonging
to
the
school
bookbinding
and
carpentry
were
taught
and
at
christmas
the
embryo
made
boxes
with
locks
and
hinges
finished
veneered
and
polished
in
england
in
we
have
given
to
us
play
in
which
one
who
has
tried
it
gives
the
results
of
his
own
experiments
in
education
through
play
caldwell
cook
was
not
satisfied
with
the
condition
of
affairs
when
school
above
the
kindergarten
is
a
nuisance
because
there
is
no
play
his
dream
is
that
of
a
play
school
commonwealth
where
education
which
is
the
training
of
youth
shall
be
filled
with
the
spirit
of
youth
namely
freshness
zeal
happiness
enthusiasm
the
next
chapter
will
show
that
it
has
taken
us
exactly
a
hundred
years
to
reach
as
far
as
public
recognition
of
the
nursery
school
where
play
is
the
only
possible
motive
it
is
for
the
coming
generation
of
teachers
to
act
so
that
the
dream
of
the
play
school
commonwealth
shall
be
realised
more
quickly
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
the
lines
quoted
as
heading
for
the
next
chapter
are
written
by
a
modern
schoolmaster
chapter
iv

to
poor

on

stoop
your

we
should
have
had
nursery
schools
a
hundred
years
ago
in
the
year
in
which
froebel
founded
his
school
for
older
boys
at
keilhau
robert
owen
the
socialist
following
the
plan
prescribed
by
nature
opened
a
school
where
children
from
two
to
six
were
to
dance
and
sing
to
be
as
much
as
possible
to
learn
when
their
curiosity
induced
them
to
ask
questions
and
not
to
be
annoyed
with
books
they
were
to
be
prevented
from
acquiring
bad
habits
to
be
taught
what
they
could
understand
and
their
dispositions
were
to
be
trained
to
mutual
kindness
and
a
sincere
desire
to
contribute
all
in
their
power
to
benefit
each
other
they
were
trained
and
educated
without
punishment
or
the
fear
of
it
a
child
who
acted
improperly
was
not
considered
an
object
of
blame
but
of
pity
and
no
unnecessary
restraint
was
imposed
on
the
children
but
the
world
was
not
ready
owen
rational
infant
school
attracted
much
notice
and
an
infant
school
society
was
founded
but
even
the
enlightened
were
incapable
of
understanding
that
any
education
was
possible
without
books
and
the
promoters
rightly
though
quite
unconsciously
condemned
themselves
when
they
kept
the
title

but
dropped

still
infant
schools
had
been
started
and
interest
had
been
aroused
when
the
edict
abolishing
kindergartens
was
promulgated
in
germany
some
of
froebel
disciples
passed
to
other
lands
and
madame
von
marenholz
came
to
england
in
already
one
kindergarten

been
opened
by

exposition

by

by
a

who
had
watched
the
actual
working
of
a

gave
warm
support
to
the
new
ideas
and
wrote
an
excellent
article
on
infant
gardens
for
urging
that
since
children
are
by
infinite
wisdom
so
created
as
to
find
happiness
in
the
active
exercise
and
development
of

who

about

no

energies

up

frolic
of

not
pure
exuberance

waste
is
often

things
were
very
different
because
of
the
infant
schools
which
had
already
been
established
but
which
had
fallen
far
below
the
ideal
set
up
by
robert
owen
as
every
one
knows
the
education
given
in
those
days
to
teachers
of
elementary
schools
was
but
meagre
and
the
results
were
often
so
bad

justify

expenditure
of
public
money

results

introduced

came

act
and
the
year
saw
a
good
deal
of
movement
miss
caroline
bishop
was
appointed
to
lecture
to
the
infants
teachers
under
the
london
school
board
miss
heerwart
took
charge
of
a
training
college
for
kindergarten
teachers
in
connection
with
the
british
and
foreign
school
society
the
froehel
society
was
founded
and
madame
michaelis
took
the
kindergarten
into
the
newly
established
high
schools
for
girls
for
the
children
of
the
kindergartens
spread
rapidly
but
for
the
children
of
the
poor
there
was
no
such
happiness
the
infant
school
was
too
firmly
established
as
a
place
where
children
learned
to
read
write
and
count
and
above
all
to
sit
still
infants
teachers
received
no
special
training
for
their
work
their
course
of
study
in
which
professional
training
played
but
a
small
part
was
the
same
as
that
prescribed
for
the
teachers
of
older
children
some
colleges
notably
the
home
and
colonial
stockwell
and
saffron
walden
did
try
to
give
their
students
some
special
training
but
it
was
not
of
much
avail
and
the
word
kindergarten
came
to
mean
not
nursery
school
as
was
the
idea
of
its
founder
but
dictated
exercises
with
kindergarten
material
a
kind
of
manual
drill
supposed
to
give
hand
and
eye
training
and
with
this
meaning
it
made
its
appearance
on
the
visitors
from
america
were
shocked
to
find
no
kindergartens
in
england
but
only
large
classes
of
poor
little
automatons
sitting
erect
with
hands
behind
or
worse
still
hands
on
heads
and
moving
only
to
the
word
of
command
one
lady
who
ultimately
found
her
way
to
our
own
kindergarten
told
me
that
she
had
been
informed
at
the
offices
that
there
were
no
kindergartens
in
london
it
was
partly
the
scandalised
expressions
of
these
american
teachers
that
stimulated
miss
adelaide
wragge
to
take
her
courage
into
her
hands
and
in
the
year
to
open
the
first
mission
kindergarten
in
england
she
called
it
a
mission
not
a
free
kindergarten
partly
because
the
parents
paid
the
trifling
fee
of
one
penny
per
week
and
partly
because
it
was
connected
with
the
parish
work
of
holy
trinity
woolwich
of
which
her
brother
was
vicar
the
first
report
says
the
neighbourhood
was
suitable
for
the
experiment
little
children
needing
just
the
kind
of
training
we
proposed
to
give
them
abounded
everywhere
the
woolwich
children
were
typical
slum
babies
varying
in
ages
from
three
to
six
years
very
poor
very
dirty
totally
untrained
in
good
habits
at
first
we
only
admitted
a
few
and
when
these
began
to
improve
gradually
increased
the
numbers
to
they
needed
great
patience
and
care
but
they
responded
wonderfully
to
the
love
given
them
and
before
long
they
were
real
kindergarten
children
full
of
vigour
merriment
and
as
is
done
in
connection
with
all
free
kindergartens
parents
evenings
were
instituted
from
the
first
and
the
mothers
were
helped
to
understand
their
children
by
simple
talks
sesame
house

training
had
been
opened
six
months
before
this
mission
kindergarten
it
was
founded
by
the
sesame
club
and
at
its
head
was
miss
schepel
who
for
twenty
years
had
been
at
the
head
of
the
pestalozzi
froebel
house
the
idea
of
home
life
training
attracted
students
who
were
not
obliged
by
stern
necessity
to
earn
their
daily
bread
though
the
methods
were
not
quite
in
line
with
progressive
thought
the
atmosphere
created
by
miss
schepel
warmly
seconded
by
miss
buckton
was
one
of
enthusiasm
in
the
service
of
children
the
second
nursery
school
in
london
had
its
origin
in
this
enthusiasm
miss
maufe
left
sesame
house
early
in
and
started
a
free
child
garden
in
west
london
four
years
later
she
moved
to
westminster
to
a
block
of
workmen
dwellings
erected
on
the
site
of
the
old
millbank
prison
this
child
garden
has
a
special
interest
from
the
fact
that
it
was
carried
on
actually
in
a
block
of
workmen
dwellings
like
the
houses
of
a
later
date
the
effort
was
voluntary
and
the
rooms
were
small
but
if
the
experiment
had
been
supported
by
the
authorities
it
would
have
been
easy
to
take
down
dividing
walls
to
get
sufficient
space
miss
maufe
gave
herself
and
her
income
for
about
twelve
years
but
difficulties
created
by
the
war
the
impossibility
of
finding
efficient
help
and
consequent
drain
upon
her
own
strength
have
forced
her
to
close
her
little
school

the
inhabitants
are
of
the
poorest
and
miss
howden
left
her
savings
to
start
a
free
kindergarten
in
the
canongate
the
sum
was
not
large
but
it
was
seed
sown
in
faith
and
its
harvest
has
been
abundant

edinburgh
with
its
population

five

it
was
from
the
date
of

that
the

became
general
though
it
had
been
used
by
madame

as
early
as
in
the
following
year
the
board
of
education
published
its
reports
on
children
under
five
years
of
age
with
its
prefatory
memorandum
stating
that
a
new
form
of
school
is
necessary
for
poor
children
and
that
parents
who
must
send
their
little
ones
to

should
send
them
to
nursery

rather
than
to

be
wished

it
could
birmingham
had
good
reason
to
be
in
the
forefront
since
many
of
its
citizens
had
in
their

the

of
the
excellent
works
of
miss

the

kindergarten
in
sir

spoke
strongly
in
favour
of
these
institutions
calling
them
a
protest
against
the
idea
of
the
comparative
unimportance
of
childhood
miss
hardy
opened
her
child
garden
in
and
that
work
has
grown
so
that
the
children
are
now
kept
till
they
are
eight
years
old
the
edinburgh
provincial
council
for
the
training
of
teachers
opened
another
free
kindergarten
as
a
demonstration
school
for
froebelian
methods
a
practising
school
for
students
and
also
as
an
experimental
school
where
attempts
might
be
made

it
was
the
headmistress
of
this
school

invented
the
net

now
in

she
wanted
something
hygienic
and

the

might
sleep

that
runs
through

was
in

miss
esther
lawrence
of
the
froebel
institute
inspired
her
old
students
to
help
her
to
open
the
michaelis
free
kindergarten
since
the
war
the
name
has
been
altered
to
the
michaelis
nursery
school
which
is
in
netting
dale
on
the
edge
of
a
very
poor
neighbourhood
where
large
families
often
occupy
a
single
room
as
in
the
edinburgh
free
kindergartens
dinner
is
provided
for
which
the
parents
pay
one
penny
the
first
report
tells
how
necessary
are
nursery
schools
in
such
surroundings
the
little
child
who
was
formerly
tied
to
the
leg
of
the
bed
and
left
all
day
while
his
mother
was
out
at
work
is
now
enjoying
the
happy
freedom
of
the
kindergarten
the
child
whose
clothes
were
formerly
sewn
on
to
him
to
save
his
mother
the
periodical
labour
of
sewing
on
buttons
is
now
undressed
and
bathed
regularly
the
attacks
on
children
by
drunken
parents
are
less
frequent
when
the
kindergarten
was
first
opened
many
of
the
children
were
quite
listless
they
did
not
know
how
to
play
did
not
care
to
play
now
they
play
with
pleasure
and
with
vigour
and
one
can
hardly
believe
they
are
the
listless
spiritless
children
of
a
year
ago
in
miss
lawrence
succeeded
in
opening
what
was
called
from
the
first
the
somers
town
nursery
school
where
the
same
kind
of
work
is
done
one
of
the
reports
says
it
is
interesting
to
see
the
children
sweeping
or
dusting
a
room
washing
their
dusters
and
dolls
clothes
polishing
the
furniture
their
shoes
and
anything
which
needs
polishing
on
friday
morning
the
is
cleaned
and
the
brilliant
results
give
great
pleasure
and
satisfaction
to
the
little
polishers
you
done
your
work
was
the
question
addressed
to
a
visitor
by
a
child
and
the
visitor
beat
a
hasty
retreat
ashamed
perhaps
of
being
the
only
drone
in
the
busy
hive
at
dinner
time
four
children
wait
on
the
rest
and
very
well
and
quickly
the
food
is
handed
round
and
the
plates
removed
there
are

kindergartens
at

one
is
in

of

and

in

the
candid
mother
she
met
one
saturday
who

told
the
children
to
wash
their
faces
in
case
they
met
you
the
phoenix
park
kindergarten
in
glasgow
is
interesting
because
the
site
was
granted
by
an
enlightened
corporation
and
the
parks
committee
laid
out
the
garden
while
the
real
start
came
from
the
pupils
of
a
school
for
girls
of
families
by
this
time
other
social
agencies
have
been
grouped
round
the
kindergarten
as
a
centre
the
caldecott
nursery
school
was
opened
in
and
has
grown
into
the
caldecott
community
which
has
now
taken
its
children
to
live
altogether
in
the
country
this
nursery
school
was
never
intended
to
be
a
kindergarten
it
was
started
as
an
interesting
experiment
chiefly
perhaps
in
the
hope
that
the
children
might
enjoy
that
instruction
which
is
usually
absorbed
by
the
children
of
the
wealthy
in
their
own
nurseries
by
virtue
of
their
happier
surroundings
and
in
the
very
year
in
which
we
were
plunged
into
war
miss
margaret
put
into
actual
shape
what
she
had
long
thought
of
and
opened
her
baby
camp
and
nursery
school
with
a
place
for
toddlers
in
between
the
full
story
of
which
is
told
in
camp
in
the
camp
itself
the
things
which
impress
the
visitor
most
are
first
the
space
and
the
fresh
air
the
sky
above
and
the
brown
earth
below
and
next
the
family
feeling
which
is
so
plain
in
spite
of
the
numbers
the
camp
existed
long
before
it
was
a
baby
camp
and
nursery
school
for
miss
began
with
a
school
clinic
and
went
on
to
camps
for
girls
and
for
boys
before
going
to
the
preventive
and
constructive
work
of
the
baby
camp
clean
and
healthy
bodies
come
first
but
to
miss
enthusiasm
everything
in
life
is
educative
the
war
has
increased
the
supply
of
nursery
schools
because
the
need
for
them
has
become
glaringly
apparent
many
experiments
are
going
on
now
and
it
seems
as
if
experimental
work
would
be
encouraged
not
hampered
by
unyielding
regulations
the
nursery
school
should
cover
the
ages
for
which
the
kindergarten
was
instituted
roughly
from
three
to
six
years
old
already
there
are
excellent
baby
rooms
in
some
parts
of
london
and
no
doubt
in
other
towns
and
the
only
reason
for
disturbing
these
is
to
provide
the
children
with
more
space
and
more
fresh
air
or
with
something
resembling
a
garden
rather
than
a
bare
yard
one
school
in
london
has
a
creche
or
day
nursery
not
exactly
a
part
of
it
but
in
closest
touch
established
owing
to
the
efforts
of
an
enthusiastic
headmistress
working
along
with
the
norland
place
nurses
its
space
is
at
present
insufficient
but
the
neighbouring
buildings
are
condemned
and
will
come
down
after
the
war
they
need
not
go
up
again
then
the
space
could
be
used
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
camp
school
that
would
be
to
the
benefit
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
there
could
be
at
least
one
experiment
where
from
creche
to
standard
vii
might
be
in
close
connection
miss
ideal
is
to
have
a
large
space
in
the
centre
of
a
district
with
covered
passages
radiating
from
it
so
that
mothers
from
a
large
area
could
bring
their
little
ones
and
leave
them
in
safety
it
would
be
safety
it
would
be
salvation
but
as
the
scots
proverb
has
it
it
is
a
far
cry
to
loch
awe
another
question
much
debated
is
who
is
to
be
in
charge
of
these
children
the
day
nursery
or
crèche
must
undoubtedly
be
staffed
with
nurses
but
with
nurses
trained
to
care
for
children
not
merely
sick
nurses
there
are
however
certain
people
who
believe
that
the
trained
nurse
is
the
right
person
to
be
in
charge
of
children
up
to
five
while
others
think
that
young
girls
or
uneducated
women
will
suffice
we
are
thankful
that
the
board
of
education
takes
up
the
position
that
a
and
specially
trained
teacher
is
to
be
the
person
responsible
we
certainly
want
the
help
both
of
the
trained
nurse
and
of
the
motherly
woman
the
trained
nurse
will
be
far
more
use
in
detecting
and
attending
to
the
ailments
of
children
than
the
teacher
can
be
and
the
motherly
woman
can
give
far
more
efficient
help
in
training
children
to
decent
habits
than
any
young
probationer
useful
though
these
may
be
but
there
is
always
the
fear
that
the
nurses
may
think
that
good
food
and
cleanliness
are
all
a
child
requires
and
as
miss
says
the
sight
of
the
toddlers
empty
hands
and
mute
lips
does
not
trouble
them
at
all
but
every
man
to
his
trade
and
though
the
teacher
in
charge
must
know
something
about
ailing
children
it
is
very
doubtful
if
a
few
months
in
a
hospital
will
advantage
her
much
here
she
trenches
on
the
province
of
the
real
nurse
whose
training
is
thorough
and
the
little
knowledge
as
every
one
knows
is
sometimes
dangerous
one
nursery
school
teacher
with
years
of
experience
says
that
what
she
learned
in
hospital
has
been
of
no
use
to
her
and
it
is
probable
that
attendance
at
a
clinic
for
children
would
be
really
more
useful
certainly
the
main
concern
of
the
nursery
school
teacher
is
sympathetic
understanding
of
children
there
must
be
no
more
of
go
and
see
what
tommy
is
doing
in
the
next
room
and
tell
him
not
to
but
go
and
see
what
tommy
is
trying
to
accomplish
and
make
it
possible
for
him
to
carry
on
his
through
that
of
the
human
instincts
of
activity
investigation
and
construction
which
constitutes
a
kindergarten
chapter
v
the
world
mine
oyster
a
box
of
counters
and
a
stone
a
piece
of
glass
abraded
by
the
beach
and
six
or
seven
shells
if
early
education
consist
in
fostering
natural
activities
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
froebel
hit
upon
the
activity
most
prominent
of
all
in
the
case
of
young
children
viz
the
impulse
to
investigate
for
his
crest
the
little
child
should
share
in
the
motto
given
to
the
mongoose
family
in
kipling
and
find
out
most
writers
on
the
education
of
young
children
have
emphasised
the
importance
of
what
is
most
inadequately
called
sense
training
and
it
is
here
that
montessori
takes
her
stand
with
her
didactic
apparatus
froebel
ideas
seem
wider
he
realises
that
the
sword
with
which
the
child
opens
his
oyster
is
a
sword
that
he
uses
not
only
his
sense
organs
as
tools
for
investigation
but
his
whole
body
his
pathway
to
knowledge
and
to
power
over
himself
and
his
surroundings
is
action
and
action
of
all
kinds
is
as
necessary
to
him
as
the
use
of
his
senses
the
child
first
utterance
is
force
says
froebel
and
his
first
discovery
is
the
resistance
of
matter
when
he
pushes
with
his
feet
against
what
resists
them
his
first
experiments
are
with
his
body
his
first
toys
are
his
own
limbs
and
his
first
play
is
the
use
of
body
senses
and
limbs
for
the
sake
of
use
not
for
result
one
use
of
his
body
is
the
imitation
of
any
moving
object
and
froebel
tells
the
mother
if
your
child
to
understand
action
in
the
world
without
you
must
let
his
tiny
hand
imitative
move
about
this
is
the
reason
why
baby
will
never
still
imitate
whatever
by
at
this
stage
the
child
is
to
move
freely
and
be
active
to
grasp
and
hold
with
his
own
hands
he
is
to
stand
when
he
can
sit
erect
and
draw
himself
up
not
to
walk
till
he
can
creep
rise
freely
maintain
his
balance
and
proceed
by
his
own
effort
he
is
to
be
hindered
by
swaddling
bands
such
as
are
in
use
in
continental
countries
nor
later
on
to
be
by
too
much
words
which
every
mother
and
teacher
should
write
upon
her
phylacteries
but
as
soon
as
he
can
move
himself
the
surroundings
speak
to
the
child
outer
objects
him
to
seize
and
grasp
them
and
if
they
are
distant
they
invite
him
who
would
bring
them
nearer
to
move
towards
them
this
use
of
the
word
invite
is
worthy
of
notice
and
calls
to
mind
a
sentence
used
by
a
writer
on
freud
that
the
activity
of
a
human
being
is
a
constant
function
of
his
environment
we
adults
who
are
so
ready
with
our
do
touch
must
endeavour
to
remember
how
everything
is
shouting
to
a
child
look
at
me
listen
to
me
come
and
fetch
me
and
find
out
all
you
can
about
me
by
every
means
in
your
power
footnote
freudian
edwin
holt
if
we
have
anything
to
do
with
little
children
we
must
face
the
fact
that
the
child
is
if
not
quite
a
robinson
crusoe
on
his
island
at
least
an
explorer
in
a
strange
country
and
a
scientist
in
his
laboratory
but
there
is
nothing
narrow
in
his
outlook
the
name
of
this
chapter
is
deliberately
chosen
the
whole
world
is
the
child
oyster
his
interests
are
from
his
first
walk
he
is
the
geographer
each
little
walk
is
a
tour
of
discovery
each
object
the
chair
the
wall
is
an
america
a
new
world
which
he
either
goes
around
to
see
if
it
be
an
island
or
whose
coast
he
follows
to
discover
if
it
be
a
continent
each
new
phenomenon
is
a
discovery
in
the
child
small
and
yet
rich
world
one
may
go
round
the
chair
one
may
stand
before
it
behind
it
but
one
can
not
go
behind
the
bench
or
the
wall
then
comes
an
inquiry
into
the
physical
properties
of
surrounding
objects
the
effort
to
reach
a
particular
object
may
have
its
source
in
the
child
desire
to
hold
himself
firm
and
upright
by
it
but
we
also
observe
that
it
gives
him
pleasure
to
touch
to
feel
to
grasp
and
perhaps
also
which
is
a
new
phase
of
activity
to
be
able
to
move
it
the
chair
is
hard
or
soft
the
seat
is
smooth
the
corner
is
pointed
the
edge
is
sharp
the
business
of
the
adult
froebel
goes
on
to
say
is
to
supply
these
names
not
primarily
to
develop
the
power
of
speech
but
to
define
his
sense
impressions
next
the
scientist
must
stock
his
laboratory
with
material
for
experiment
the
child
is
attracted
by
the
bright
round
smooth
pebble
by
the
gaily
fluttering
bit
of
paper
by
the
smooth
bit
of
board
by
the
rectangular
block
by
the
brilliant
quaint
leaf
look
at
the
child
that
can
scarcely
keep
himself
erect
that
can
walk
only
with
the
greatest
care
he
sees
a
twig
a
bit
of
straw
painfully
he
secures
it
and
like
the
bird
carries
it
to
his
nest
see
him
again
laboriously
stooping
and
slowly
going
forward
on
the
ground
under
the
eaves
of
the
roof
the
deep
eaves
of
the
thuringian
peasant
house
the
force
of
the
rain
has
washed
out
of
the
sand
smooth
bright
pebbles
and
the
child
gathers
them
as
building
stones
as
it
were
as
material
for
future
building
and
is
he
wrong
is
he
not
in
truth
collecting
material
for
his
future
life
building
the
box
of
counters
and
the
stone
the
brilliant
quaint
leaf
the
twig
the
bit
of
straw
all
the
child
treasures
these
are
the
stimuli
which
according
to
the
biologist
educator
must
be
supplied
if
the
activities
appropriate
to
each
stage
are
to
be
called
forth
every
one
knows
for
how
long
a
period
a
child
can
occupy
himself
examining
comparing
and
experimenting
like
things
says
froebel
must
be
ranged
together
unlike
things
separated
the
child
loves
all
things
that
enter
his
small
horizon
and
extend
his
little
world
to
him
the
least
thing
is
a
new
discovery
but
it
must
not
come
dead
into
the
little
world
nor
lie
dead
therein
lest
it
obscure
the
small
horizon
and
crush
the
little
world
therefore
the
child
would
know
why
he
loves
this
thing
he
would
know
all
its
properties
for
this
reason
he
examines
the
object
on
all
sides
for
this
reason
he
tears
and
breaks
it
for
this
reason
he
puts
it
in
his
mouth
and
bites
it
we
reprove
the
child
for
naughtiness
and
foolishness
and
yet
he
is
wiser
than
we
who
reprove
him
this
experimenting
is
one
side
of
a
child
play
and
the
things
with
which
he
thus
experiments
are
his
toys
or
as
froebel
puts
it
play
material
much
of
this
is
and
ought
to
be
self
found
and
where
the
child
can
find
his
own
toys
he
asks
for
little
more
the
seaside
supplies
him
with
sand
and
water
stones
shells
rock
pools
seaweed
and
he
asks
us
for
nothing
but
a
spade
which
digs
deeper
than
his
naked
hands
and
a
pail
to
carry
water
which
hands
alone
can
not
convey
the
vista
of
the
sand
is
the
child
free
land
where
the
seem
half
afraid
even
nurse
forgets
to
sniff
and
to
call
come
here
as
she
sits
very
near
to
the
far
up
cliff
and
you
venture
alone
with
your
spade
even
indoors
a
child
could
probably
find
for
himself
all
the
material
for
investigation
all
the
stimuli
he
requires
if
it
were
not
that
his
investigations
interfere
with
adult
purposes
even
in
very
primitive
times
the
child
probably
experimented
upon
the
revolving
qualities
of
his
mother
spindle
till
she
found
it
more
convenient
to
let
him
have
one
for
himself
and
it
became
a
toy
or
top
froebel
who
made
so
much
of
play
to
whom
it
was
spontaneous
education
and
self
realisation
was
bound
to
see
that
toys
were
important
the
man
advanced
in
insight
he
said
even
when
he
gives
his
child
a
plaything
must
make
clear
to
himself
its
purpose
and
the
purpose
of
playthings
and
occupation
material
in
general
this
purpose
is
to
aid
the
child
freely
to
express
what
lies
within
him
and
to
bring
the
outer
world
nearer
to
him
and
thus
to
serve
as
mediator
between
the
mind
and
the
world
froebel
gifts
were
an
attempt
to
supply
right
play
material
true
to
his
faith
in
natural
impulse
froebel
watched
children
to
see
what
playthings
they
found
for
themselves
or
which
among
those
presented
by
adults
were
most
appreciated
soft
little
coloured
balls
seemed
right
material
for
a
baby
tender
hand
and
it
was
clear
that
when
the
child
could
crawl
about
he
was
ready
for
something
which
he
could
roll
on
the
floor
and
pursue
on
all
fours
as
early
as
two
years
old
he
loves
to
take
things
out
of
boxes
and
to
move
objects
about
so
boxes
of
bricks
were
supplied
graded
in
number
and
in
variety
of
form
not
for
a
moment
did
froebel
suggest
that
the
child
was
to
be
limited
to
these
selected
playthings
he
expressly
stated
the
contrary
and
he
frequently
said
that
spontaneity
was
not
to
be
checked
but
from
what
has
followed
from
the
way
in
which
these
little
toys
have
been
misused
we
are
tempted
to
speculate
on
whether
these
gifts
supplied
that
definite
foundation
without
which
in
these
days
no
notice
would
have
been
taken
of
the
new
ideas
or
whether
they
have
proved
the
sunken
rock
on
which
much
that
was
valuable
has
perished
the
world
was
not
ready
to
believe
in
the
educational
value
of
play
just
pure
play
nor
is
it
yet
for
the
new
system
in
its
didactic
apparatus
froebel
in
his
mistake
of
trying
to
systematise
the
material
for
spontaneous
education
carefully
planned
as
were
froebel
own
gifts
the
new
apparatus
presents
a
series
of
exercises
in
sense
discrimination
satisfying
no
doubt
while
unfamiliar
but
suffering
from
the
defect
of
the
too
finished
and
complex
plaything
in
which
froebel
saw
a
danger
which
slumbers
like
a
viper
under
the
roses
the
danger
is
that
the
child
can
begin
no
new
thing
with
it
can
not
produce
enough
variety
by
its
means
his
power
of
creative
imagination
his
power
of
giving
outward
form
to
his
own
ideas
are
thus
actually
deadened
to
realise
his
aims
man
and
more
particularly
the
child
requires
material
though
it
be
only
a
bit
of
wood
or
a
pebble
with
which
he
makes
something
or
which
he
makes
into
something
in
order
to
lead
the
child
to
the
handling
of
material
we
give
him
the
ball
the
cube
and
other
bodies
the
kindergarten
gifts
each
of
these
gifts
incites
the
child
to
free
spontaneous
activity
to
independent
movement
froebel
would
have
sympathised
deeply
with
the
views
of
peter
as
expressed
by
wells
in
regard
to
ideals
which
he
however
called
toys
the
theory
of
ideals
played
almost
as
important
a
part
in
the
early
philosophy
of
peter
as
it
did
in
the
philosophy
of
plato
but
peter
did
not
call
them
ideals
he
called
them
toys
were
the
simplified
essences
of
things
pure
perfect
and
manageable
real
things
were
troublesome
uncontrollable
and
largely
irrelevant
a
real
train
for
example
was
a
poor
big
clumsy
limited
thing
that
was
obliged
to
go
to
redhill
or
croydon
or
london
that
was
full
of
unnecessary
strangers
usually
sitting
firmly
in
the
window
seats
that
you
could
do
nothing
with
at
all
a
toy
train
was
your
very
own
it
took
you
wherever
you
wanted
to
fairyland
or
russia
or
anywhere
at
whatever
pace
you
chose
footnote
and
p
froebel
asks
what
presents
are
most
prized
by
the
child
and
by
mankind
in
general
and
answers
those
which
afford
him
a
means
of
developing
his
mind
of
giving
it
freest
activity
of
expressing
it
clearly
for
her
ideas
as
to
educative
material
montessori
went
not
to
normal
life
not
even
to
children
but
to
what
may
he
called
curative
appliances
to
the
material
invented
by
séguin
to
develop
the
dormant
powers
of
defective
children
she
herself
came
to
the
study
of
education
from
the
medical
side
the
curative
froebel
with
his
belief
in
human
instinct
naturally
went
to
what
he
called
the
mother
room
which
we
should
call
the
nursery
and
to
the
garden
where
the
child
finds
his
bright
round
smooth
pebble
and
his
brilliant
quaint
leaf
no
one
would
seek
to
the
importance
of
sense
discrimination
but
it
can
be
exercised
without
formalism
and
it
need
not
be
mere
discrimination
it
is
in
connection
with
the
taste
and
smell
games
that
froebel
tells
the
mother
that
the
higher
is
rooted
in
the
lower
morality
in
instinct
the
spiritual
in
the
material
the
baby
enjoys
the
scent
thanks
the
kind
spirit
that
put
it
there
and
must
let
mother
smell
it
too
so
from
the
beginning
there
is
a
touch
of
aesthetic
pleasure
and
a
recognition
of
what
the
dear
god
is
saying
outside
as
to
how
sense
discrimination
may
be
exercised
without
formality
there
is
a
charming
picture
in
camp
and
then
that
sense
of
which
got
so
little
exercise
and
attention
that
it
went
to
sleep
altogether
so
that
millions
get
no
warning
and
no
joy
through
it
we
met
the
need
for
its
education
in
the
baby
camp
by
having
a
herb
garden
back
from
the
shelters
and
open
ground
in
a
shady
place
we
have
planted
fennel
mint
lavender
sage
marjoram
thyme
rosemary
herb
gerrard
and
rue
and
over
and
above
these
pungently
smelling
things
there
are
little
fields
of
mignonette
we
have
balm
indeed
everywhere
in
our
garden
the
toddlers
go
round
the
beds
of
herbs
pinching
the
leaves
with
their
tiny
fingers
and
then
putting
their
fingers
to
their
noses
there
are
two
little
couples
going
the
rounds
just
now
one
is
a
pair
of
new
comers
very
much
astonished
the
other
couple
old
inhabitants
delighted
to
show
the
wonders
of
the
place
coming
back
with
odorous
hands
they
perhaps
want
to
tell
us
about
the
journey
their
eyes
are
bright
their
mouths
open
in
chapter
ii
we
quoted
the
biologist
educator
ideal
conception
of
the
surroundings
best
suited
to
bring
about
right
development
let
us
now
visit
one
or
two
actual
kindergartens
and
see
if
these
conditions
are
in
any
way
realised
by
the
followers
of
froebel
the
first
one
we
enter
is
certainly
a
large
bright
room
for
one
side
is
open
to
light
with
two
large
windows
and
between
them
glass
doors
opening
into
the
playground
there
is
no
heap
of
sand
in
a
corner
nor
is
there
a
tub
of
water
for
the
practical
teacher
knows
how
little
hands
if
not
little
feet
with
their
vigorous
but
as
yet
uncontrolled
movements
would
splash
the
water
and
scatter
the
sand
with
dire
effects
as
to
the
floor
which
the
theorist
fondly
imagines
would
always
be
clean
enough
to
sit
upon
but
there
is
a
big
enough
and
deep
enough
for
six
to
eight
children
to
use
individually
or
together
as
spontaneous
activity
with
its
ceaseless
efforts
at
experimenting
ceaselessly
spills
the
sand
within

is
of
opinion
that
children
of
even
three
and
four
are
not
too
young
to
begin
to
learn
the
lesson
of
and
and
she
also
thinks
it
is
good
to
have
some
treasures
which
do
not
come
out
every
day
and
which
may
require
more
delicate
handling
than
the
ordinary
toy
ought
to
need
for
this

to
be
strong
enough
to
bear
unskilled
handling
and
vigorous
movements
for
a
broken
toy
ought
to
be
a
tragedy
at
the
same
time
it
is
part
of
a
child
training
to
learn
to
use
dainty
objects
with
delicate
handling

such
things
form

this
kindergarten
is
part
of
a
large
institution
and
the
playground
to
which
it
has
direct
access
is
of
considerable
extent
there
is
a
big
stretch
of
grass
and
another
of
asphalt
so
that
in
suitable
weather
the
tables
and
chairs
the
the
bricks
and
anything
else
that
is
wanted
can
be
carried
outside
so
that
the
children
can
live
in
the
open
which
of
course
is
better
than
any
room
in
the
playground
there
is
a
bank
where
the
children
can
run
up
and
down
and
there
are
a
few
planks
and
a
builder
trestle
on
which
they
can
be
poised
for

or

these
are

walking

in

procession
of
children
with
hoops
and
toy
motor
cars
when
we
make
our
visit
the
day
is
fine
and
the
room
is
empty
the
children
are
all
outside
the
garden
is
not
large
but
there
is
some
space
and
under
the
shade
of
two
big
trees
we
find
rugs
spread
on
which
the
children
are
sitting
standing
kneeling
and
lying
according
to
their
occupation
one
is
building
with
large
blocks
and
must
stand
up
to
complete
her
erection
another
is
lying
flat
putting
together
a
jigsaw
another
a
boy
is
threading
beads
while
another
has
built
railway
arches
and
with
much
whistling
and
the
greatest
carefulness
is
guiding
his
train
through
the
tunnels
the
play
is
almost
entirely
individual
but
very
often
you
hear
o
miss
x
come
and
see
what
i
done
after
about
an
hour
during
which
a
few
of
the
children
have
changed
their
occupations
those
who
wish
to
do
so
join
some
older
children
who
are
playing
games
involving
movement
this
may
be
a
traditional
game
like
looby
loo
or
round

round
the
village
or
it
may
be
one
of
the
best
of
the
old
kindergarten
games

the
washing
up
is
to
be
done
in
a
beautiful
new
white
sink
which
is
displayed
with
pride
our
next
visit
is
to
a
free
kindergarten
the
rooms
are
quite
as
attractive
as
rich
in
charming
friezes
as
in
the
others
and
the
furnishing
in
some
ways
is
much
the
same
but
here
we
see
what
we
have
not
seen
before
for
here
is
a
large
room
filled
with
tiny
hammock
beds
the
windows
are
wide
open
but
the
blinds
are
down
for
the
children
are
having
their
afternoon
sleep
here
as
in
all
free
kindergartens
the
children
are
provided
with
simple
but
pretty
overalls
which
the
parents
are
pleased
to
house
shoes
are
also
provided
partly
to
minimise
the
noise
from
active
little
feet
but
principally
because
the
poor
little
boots
are
often
a
painfully
inadequate
protection
from
wet
pavements
the
children
are
trained
to
tidy
ways
and
to
independence
they
can
not
read
but
by
picture
cards
they
recognise
their
own
beds
pegs
and
other
properties
they
take
out
and
put
away
their
own
things
and
give
all
reasonable
help
in
laying
tables
and
serving
food
in
washing
dusting
and
sweeping
up
crumbs
as
is
done
in
any
true
kindergarten
in
the
garden
of
this
free
kindergarten
there
is
a
large
surrounded
by
a
low
wooden
framework
and
having
a
pole
across
the
middle
so
that
it
resembles
a
cucumber
frame
and
a
cover
can
be
thrown
over
the
sand
to
keep
it
clean
when
not
in

froebel

list
of
playthings
contains
besides
balls
and

coloured

coloured
tablets
for
laying
patterns
coloured
papers
for
cutting
folding
and
plaiting
pencils
paints
and
brushes
modelling

and

coloured

for

and

and
such
little
sticks
and
laths
as
children
living
in
a
forest
region
find
for
themselves
considered
in
themselves
apart
from
the
traditions
of
formality
these
are
quite
good
play
material
or
stimuli
and
froebel
meant
the
time
to
come
when
we
shall
speak
of
the
doll
and
the
hobby
horse
as
the
first
plays
of
the
awakening
life
of
the
girl
and
the
boy
but
he
died
before
he
had
done
so
in
the
too
we
find
quite
a
good
list
of
toys
which
are
now
to
be
found
in
most
kindergartens
toys
for
the
playground
should
be
provided
a
a
seesaw
a
substantial
hoops
balls
reins
and
perhaps
something
on
which
the
child
can
balance
logs
or
planks
which
they
can
move
about
and
a
trestle
on
which
these
can
be
supported
are
invaluable
it
was
while
an
addition
was
being
made
to
our
place
that
we
realised
the
importance
of
such
things
and
as
in
froebel
case
our
teachers
were
the
children
themselves
they
were
so
supremely
happy
running
up
and
down
the
plank
roads
laid
by
the
builders
for
their
seesawing
or
balancing
and
sliding
on
others
that
we
could
not
face
the
desolation
of
emptiness
which
would
come
when
the
workmen
removed
their
things
so
for
a
few
pounds
all
that
the
children
needed
was
secured
ordinary
planks
for
seesawing
narrower
for
balancing
and
a
couple
of
trestles
one
exercise
the
children
had
specially
enjoyed
was
jumping
up
and
down
on
yielding
planks
and
this
the
workmen
had
forbidden
because
the
planks
might
crack
but
a
sympathetic
foreman
told
us
what
was
needed
two
planks
of
special
springy
wood
were
fastened
together
by
cross
pieces
at
each
end
and
besides
making
excellent
slides
these
made
most
exciting
springboards
for
representations
of
real
life
the
children
require
dolls
and
the
simplest
of
furniture
a
bed
which
need
only
be
a
box
some
means
of
carrying
out
the
doll
washing
her
personal
requirements
as
well
as
her
clothes
some
little
and
pots
and
pans
a
doll
house
is
not
necessary
and
can
only
be
used
by
two
or
three
children
but
will
be
welcomed
if
provided
and
its
appointments
give
practice
in
dainty
handling
trains
and
signals
of
some
kind
or
otherwise
animals
for
farm
or
zoo
a
pair
of
scales
for
a
shop
and
some
sort
of
delivery
van
which
of
course
may
be
there
must
also
be
provision
for
increase
of
skill
and
possibility
of
creation
if
the
kindergarten
can
afford
it
some
of
the
montessori
material
may
be
provided
there
is
no
reason
except
expense
why
it
should
not
be
used
if
the
children
like
it
and
if
it
does
not
take
up
too
much
room
but
it
has
no
creative
possibilities
and
even
at
three
years
old
this
is
required
scissors
are
an
important
tool
and
an
old
book
of
sample
is
most
useful
old
and
used
matches
paste
and
brushes
and
some
old
magazines
to
cut
blackboard
chalks
and
crayons
with
four
to
six
important
colours
some
kindergarten
folding
papers
all
these
supply
colour
certain
toys
seem
specially
suited
to
give
hand
control
a
noah
ark
where
the
small
animals
are
to
be
set
out
carefully
tops
or
teetotums
and
tiddlywinks
at
which
some
little
children
become
proficient
the
puzzle
interest
must
not
be
forgotten
and
simple
jigsaw
pictures
give
great
pleasure
it
is
interesting
to
note
here
that
the
youngest
children
fit
these
puzzles
not
by
the
picture
but
by
form
though
they
know
they
are
making
a
picture
and
are
pleased
when
it
is
finished
the
puzzle
with
six
pictures
on
the
sides
of
cubes
is
much
more
difficult
than
a
simple
jigsaw
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
come
in
useful
and
especially
for
the
poorer
children
these
should
be
provided
any
one
who
remembers
the
pleasure
derived
from
coloured
envelope
bands
from
transparent
paper
from
crackers
and
from
certain
advertisements
will
save
these
for
children
to
whose
homes
such
treasures
never
come
a
box
containing
scraps
of
soft
cloth
possibly
a
bit
of
velvet
some
bits
of
smooth
and
shining
coloured
silk
give
the
pleasure
of
sense
discrimination
without
the
formality
of
the
montessori
graded
boxes
and
are
easier
to
replace
some
substitute
for
mother
button
box
a
box
of
shells
or
coloured
seeds
a
box
of
feathers
all
these
things
will
be
played
with
which
means
observation
and
discrimination
comparison
and
contrast
and
in
addition
where
colour
is
involved
there
is
aesthetic
pleasure
and
this
also
enters
into
the
touching
of
smooth
or
soft
surfaces
softness
is
a
joy
to
children
as
is
shown
in
the
woolly
lambs
provided
for
babies
a
little
one
of
my
acquaintance
had
a
bit
of
blanket
which
comforted
many
woes
and
when
once
i
offered
her
a
feather
boa
as
a
substitute
she
sobbed
out
it
is
so
soft

the
blanket

his
tiny

rather
than

at

before

learns
to
turn

in

through
touching
many

he
begins
his
education

he
is
the
nursling
of

it
is
possible
that
his
first
exercises
are
rather
restricted
he
touches
silk
ivory
muslin
and
fine

that
is
all
and
that
is
not
much
but
the
child
of
the
cottager

often
better
off

him
a

that
is
to
say
a

of

offered
to
him
to
his
great
delight

he
should
not

if

endless
imitation

what

nineteen

the
very

kindergarten
is
to
imply
a
teaching
which
fulfils
the

own
wants

desires
it
must
supply
abundant
provision
for
the
dramatic
representation
of

adults
have
always
been
ready
to
use
for
their
own
purposes
the
strong
tendency
to
imitate
which
is
a
characteristic
of
all
normal
children
but
few
even
now
realise
to
what
extent
a
child
profits
by
his
imitative
play
the
explanation
that
froebel
found
for
this
will
now
be
generally
accepted
viz
that
only
by
acting
it
out
can
a
child
fully
grasp
an
idea
for
what
he
tries
to
represent
or
do
he
begins
to
understand
he
thinks
in
action
or
as
one
writer
put
it
he
apperceives
with
his
muscles
this
explanation
seems
to
cover
imitative
play

the
little

wave

the
hand
up
to
such
elaborate
imitations

are

that

desert

we
feel
that
these
show
a
craving
for
experience
for
life
such
a
craving
as
causes
the
adult
to
lose
himself
in
a
book
of
travels
or
in
a
dramatic
performance
and
which
explains
the
phenomenal
success
of
the
cinema
poor

as
it
is

or
that
delightful

town
in
play
we
thirst
for
experiences
even
for
those
which
are
unpleasant
we
wonder
how
it
feels
to
be
up
in
an
aeroplane
or
down
in
a
submarine
we
are
far
indeed
from
desiring
but
if
such
things
must
be
there
is
a
curious
satisfaction
in
being
in
it
and
though
the
experiences
they
desire
may
be
matters
of
everyday
occurrence
to
us
children
probably
feel
the
craving
even
more
keenly

a
teacher
and
a
somewhat
inarticulate
child
wrote
i
was
out
last
night
it
was
late
why
jack
said
another
painted
your
cow
green
did
you
ever
see
a
green
cow
no
said
jack
but
i
like
to
in
early
kindergarten
days
this
imitative
and
dramatic
tendency
was
chiefly
met
in
games
and
the
children
were
by
turns
butterflies
and
bees
bakers
and
carpenters
clocks
and
windmills
the
programme
was
suggested
by
froebel
in
which
he
deals
with
the
child
nearest
environment
too
often
indeed
the
realities
to
which
froebel
referred
were
not
realities
to
english
children
but
that
was
recognised
as
a
defect
and
the
ideas
themselves
were
suitable
chickens
pigeons
and
farmyard
animals
the
homely
pussy
cat
or
canary
bird
the
workers
to
whom
the
child
is
indebted
farmer
baker
miner
builder
or
carpenter
the
sun
the
rain
the
rainbow
and
the
such
ideas
were
chosen
as
suitable
centres
and
stories
and
songs
games
and
handwork
clustered
round
what
was
the
reason
for
this
binding
of
things
together
why
did
froebel
constantly
plead
for
unity
even
for
the
tiny
child
and
tell
us
to
link
together
his
baby
or
his
first
weak
efforts
at
building
with
his
blocks
chairs
tables
beds
walls
and
ladders
looking
back
over
the
years
it
seems
as
if
this
idea
of
joining
together
has
been
trying
to
assert
itself
under
various
forms
each
of
which
has
reigned
for
its
day
has
been
carried
to
extremes
and
been
discarded
only
to
come
up
again
in
a
somewhat
different
form
it
has
always
seemed
to
aim
at
extending
and
ordering
the
mind
content
of
children
for
the
froebelian
it
was
expressed
in
such
words
as
unity
connectedness
and
continuity
while
the
herbartians
called
it
correlation
under
these
terms
much
work
has
been
and
is
still
being
carried
out
some
very
good
and
some
very
foolish
ideas
catch
on
however
because
of
the
truth
that
is
in
them
not
because
of
the
error
which
is
likely
to
be
mixed
with
it
and
even
the
weakest
effort
after
connection
embodies
an
important
truth
when
we
smile
over
absurd
stories
of
forced
correlation
we
seldom
stop
to
think
of
what
went
on
before
the
kindergarten
existed
for
instance
the
still
more
absurd
and
totally
disconnected
lists
of
object

of

years

kindergarten
practice
was
far
ahead
of
this
for
here
the
teacher
was
expected
to
choose
her
material
according
to
time
of
year
local
conditions
such
as
the
pursuits
of
the
people
social
customs
when
it
was
possible
the
children
went
to
see
the
real
blacksmith
or
the
real
cow
and
to
let
game
or
handwork
be
an
expression
and
a
of
ideas
gained
was
natural
and
right
connectedness
however
meant
more
than
this
it
meant
that
the
material
itself
was
to
be
treated
so
that
the
children
would
be
helped
to
that
real
understanding
which
comes
from
seeing
things
in
their
relations
to
each
other
as
lloyd
morgan
puts
it
we
are
mainly
at
work
upon
the
mental
background
it
is
our
object
to
make
this
background
as
rich
and
full
and
orderly
as
possible
so
that
whatever
is
brought
to
the
focus
of
consciousness
shall
be
set
in
a
relational
background
which
shall
give
it
meaning
and
so
that
our
pupils
may
be
able
to
feel
the
truth
which
browning
puts
into
the
mouth
of
fra
lippo
lippi
this
world
no
blot
for
us
nor
blank
it
means
intensely
and
means
good
to
find
its
meaning
is
my
meat
and
drink
according
to
professor
dewey
some
such
linking
or
joining
is
necessary
to
foster
that
sense
which
is
at
the
basis
of
attention
and
of
all
intellectual
growth
the
sense
of
continuity
the
herbartian
correlation
was
designed
to
further
that
circle
of
thought
out
of
which
would
come
the
firm
will
guided
by
right
insight
inspired
by
true
feeling
which
is
their
aim
in
education
froebelian
unity
and
connectedness
have
like
the
others
an
intellectual
and
a
moral
aspect
intellectually
the
essential
characteristic
of
instruction
is
the
treatment
of
individual
things
in
their
relationships
morally
the
idea
of
unity
is
that
we
are
all
members
one
of
another
the
child
who
through
unhindered
activity
has
reached
the
stage
of
is
to
go
on
to
feel
himself
a
part
a
member
of
an
whole
family
school
township
country
humanity
the
all
to
be
one
with
nature
man
and
god
every
one
has
heard
something
of
the
new
teaching
which
by
the
way
sheds
clearer
light
over
froebel
warning
against
arbitrary
interference
viz
that
a
great
part
of
the
nervous
instability
which
affects
our
generation
is
due
to
the
thwarting
and
checking
of
the
natural
impulses
of
early
years
but
this
new
school
also
gives
us
something
positive
and
reinforces
older
doctrines
by
telling
us
to
integrate
behaviour
this
matter
of
the
unthwarted
lifelong
progress
of
behaviour
integration
is
of
profound
importance
for
it
is
the
transition
from
behaviour
to
conduct
the
more
integrated
behaviour
is
harmonious
and
consistent
behaviour
toward
a
larger
and
more
comprehensive
situation
toward
a
bigger
section
of
the
universe
it
is
lucidity
and
breadth
of
purpose
the
child
playing
with
fire
is
only
wrong
conduct
because
it
is
behaviour
that
does
not
take
into
account
consequences
it
is
not
adjusted
to
enough
of
the
environment
it
will
be
made
right
by
an
enlargement
of
its
scope
and
reach
all
selfish
conduct
all
rudeness
and
roughness
come
from
ignorance
we
are
all
more
or
less
and
the
child
consciousness
of
self
has
to
be
widened
his
scope
has
to
be
enlarged
to
sympathy
with
the
thoughts
feelings
and
desires
of
other
selves
the
sane
man
is
the
man
who
however
limited
the
scope
of
his
behaviour
has
no
such
suppression
incorporated
in
him
the
wise
man
must
be
sane
and
must
have
scope
as
well

professor
earl
barnes
always
used
to
describe
the
child
mind
as
scrappy
how
can
we
best
aid
development
into
the
wholeness
or
healthiness
and
the
scope
of
sanity
and
wisdom
for
it
may
well
be
that
this
widening
and
ordering
of
experience
of
consciousness
of
behaviour
into
moral
behaviour
is
our
most
important
task
as
teachers
froebel
emphasised
the
crying
need
for
connection
of
school
and
life
pointing
out
how
the
little
child
desires
to
imitate
and
the
older
to
share
in
all
that
as
professor
dewey
puts
it
is
surcharged
with
a
sense
of
the
mysterious
values
that
attach
to
whatever
their
elders
are
concerned
with
this
is
one
of
the
points
to
which
professor
dewey
called
attention
in
his
summing
up
of
froebel
educational
principles
this
letting
the
child
reproduce
on
his
own
plane
the
typical
doings
and
occupations
of
the
larger
maturer
society
into
which
he
is
finally
to
go
forth
it
is
in
this
connection
that
he
says
the
kindergarten
teacher
has
the
opportunity
to
foster
that
most
important
sense
of
continuity
in
simple
reproduction
of
the
home
life
while
there
is
abundant
variety
since
daily
life
may
bring
us
into
contact
with
all
the
life
of
the
city
or
of
the
country
yet
because
the
work
is
within
a
whole
there
is
opportunity
to
foster
that
sense
which
is
at
the
basis
of
attention
and
of
all
intellectual
growth
a
sense
of
continuity
since
professor
dewey
gave
to
the
world
the
results
of
his
experimental
school
all
the
kindergartens
and
most
of
the
infant
schools
in
england
have
tried
to
carry
out
their
accustomed
reproduction
of
home
surroundings
more
or
less
on
the
lines
of
the
primary
department
of
his
experimental
school
they
have
extended
their
scope
and
in
addition
to
the
material
already
taken
from
workman
and
shop
from
garden
and
farm
have
also
with
much
profit
to
older
children
used
his
suggestions
about
primitive
industries
reproduction
of
home
surroundings
can
be
done
in
many
ways
one
of
which
is
to
help
the
children
to
furnish
and
to
play
with
a
doll
house
but
the
play
must
be
play
it
is
not
enough
to
use
the
drama
as
merely
offering
suggestions
for
handwork
and
one
small
doll
house
does
not
allow
of
real
play
for
more
than
one
or
two
children
our
own
children
used
to
settle
this
by
taking
out
the
furniture
and
arranging
different
homes
around
the
room
i
can
remember
the
pleasure
given
by
similar
play
in
my
own
nursery
days
when
the
actors
were
the
men
and
boys
supplied
by
tailors
advertisements
many
and
varied
were
the
experiences
of
these
paper
families
families
it
may
be
noted
none
of
whom
demeaned
themselves
so
far
as
to
possess
any
womankind
for
that
nursery
party
of
five
had
lost
its
mother
sadly
early
and
was
ruled
by
two
boys
who
evidently
thought
little
of
the
other
sex
professor
dewey
tells
us
that
nothing
is
more
absurd
than
to
suppose
that
there
is
no
middle
term
between
leaving
a
child
to
his
unguided
fancies
or
controlling
his
activities
by
a
formal
succession
of
dictated
directions
it
is
the
teacher
business
to
know
what
is
striving
for
utterance
and
to
supply
the
needed
stimulus
and
materials
to
show
how
under
the
inspiration
of
a
thoroughly
capable
teacher
this
continuity
may
be
secured
and
prolonged
for
quite
a
long
period
an
example
may
be
taken
from
the
work
of
miss
janet
payne
who
is
remarkably
successful
in
meeting
and
stimulating
without
in
any
way
forcing
the
striving
for
utterance
mentioned
by
dewey
on
this
occasion
miss
payne
produced
a
doll
about
ten
inches
high
dressed
to
resemble
the
children
fathers
and
suggested
that
a
home
should
be
made
for
him
the
children
adopted
him
with
zeal
named
him
bird
and
his
career
lasted
for
two
years
bird
required
a
family
so
bird
had
to
be
produced
with
her
little
girl
winnie
and
later
a
baby
was
added
to
the
family
beds
tables
and
chairs
including
a
high
chair
for
winnie
were
made
of
scraps
from
the
wood
box
and
for
a
long
time
bird
was
most
domesticated
miss
payne
had
used
ordinary
dolls
heads
but
had
constructed
the
bodies
herself
in
such
a
way
that
the
dolls
could
sit
and
stand
and
use
their
arms
to
wield
a
broom
or
hold
the
baby
after
some
time
one
child
said
bird
ought
to
go
to
business
and
after
much
deliberation
he
became
a
grocer
his
shop
was
made
and
stocked
and
he
attended
it
every
day
going
home
to
dinner
regularly
one
day
he
appeared
to
be
having
a
meal
on
the
shop
counter
and
it
was
explained
that
he
had
been
rather
in
a
hurry
in
the
morning
so
bird
had
given
him
his
breakfast
to
take
with
him
the
bird
family
had
various
adventures
they
had
spring
cleanings
removals
visited
the
zoo
and
went
to
the
seaside
one
morning
a
little
fellow
sat
in
a
trolley
with
the
bird
family
beside
him
for
of
an
hour
evidently
imagining
i
did
inquire
in
passing
if
it
was
a
drive
or
a
picnic
but
the
answer
was
so
brief
that
i
knew
i
was
an
interruption
and
retired
but
a
younger
and
bolder
inquirer
who
wanted
to
conduct
an
experiment
in
modelling
ventured
to
ask
if
bird
wanted
anything
that
could
be
made
at
clay
modelling
yes
he
wants
some
for
his
shop
was
the
answer
with
the
slightly
irate
addition
but
i
you
call
it
the
china
factory
when
these
children
moved
to
an
upper
class
bird
was
laid
away
but
the
children
requested
his
presence
so
he
entered
the
new
room
and
became
a
farmer
he
had
now
to
write
letters
to
arrange
rents
and
the
money
had
to
be
made
and
counted
the
letters
served
for
writing
and
reading
lessons
and
miss
payne
was
careful
to
send
the
answers
through
the
real
post
properly
addressed
to
bird
with
the
name
of
class
and
school
bird
hired
labourers
the
children
grew
corn
and
thrashed
it
and
sent
it
to
the
mill
a
miller
had
to
be
produced
and
the
children
now
his
assistants
ground
the
wheat
and
bird
came
in
his
cart
to
fetch
the
sacks
of
flour
which
ultimately
became
the
christmas
pudding
and
was
eaten
by
the
labourers
now
guests
at
the
feast
in
spring
after
careful
provision
for
their
comfort
bird
went
to
the
cattle
market
and
bought
cows
though
the
milking
had
to
be
pretence
the
butter
and
cheese
were
really
made
the
first
question
of
the
summer
term
was
what
bird
going
to
do
this
term
like
other
teachers
inspired
by
professor
dewey
we
have
found
our
children
most
responsive
to
the
suggestion
of
playing
out
primitive
man
but
with
some
not
of
course
with
the
brightest
it
is
too
great
a
stretch
to
go
at
one
step
from
the
present
to
the
most
primitive
times
and
we
often
spend
a
term
over
something
of
the
nature
of
robinson
crusoe
where
the
situation
presents
characters
accustomed
to
modern
civilisation
and
deprived
of
all
its
conveniences
miss
payne
is
careful
to
give
the
children
full
opportunity
for
suggestions
one
dull
little
boy
puzzled
his
mother
by
telling
her
i
made
a
very
good
so
though
she
had
not
contemplated
the
renewed
appearance
of
bird
she
said
what
do
you
want
him
to
do
let
him
go
out
and
shoot
bears
cried
an
embryo
sportsman
somewhat
taken
aback
miss
payne
temporised
with
he
would
find
them
in
this
country
then
let
him
go
to
india
cried
one
child
but
another
called
out
no
no
let
him
go
to
a
desert
island
and
that
was
carried
with
acclamation
bird
various
homes
were
on
a
miniature
scale
and
were
contained
in
a
series
of
zinc
trays
which
we
have
had
made
to
fit
the
available
tables
and
cupboard
tops
we
find
these
trays
convenient
as
a
new
one
can
be
added
when
more
scope
is
required
to
carry
out
new
ideas
the
following
accounts
taken
from
the
notes
of
miss
hilda
beer
while
a
student
in
training
show
another
kind
of
play
where
the
children
themselves
act
the
drama
the
notes
only
cover
a
short
period
but
they
show
how
the
play
may
arise
quite
incidentally
june
as
the
ground
is
too
damp
for
work
if
the
children
were
not
ready
with
plans
i
meant
to
suggest
building
a
railway
station
tunnel
and
later
i
thought
perhaps
we
might
paint
advertisements
of
seaside
resorts
for
our
station
but
the
children
brought
several
things
with
them
and
dorothy
brought
her
own
doll
marie
had
left
the
baby
doll
from
the
other
room
in
the
cot
so
dorothy
and
sylvia
said
they
must
look
after
the
babies
so
cecil
josie
and
i
swept
and
dusted
then
we
began
to
play
house
cecil
and
dorothy
were
and
harry
sylvia
was
loo
husband
at
the
war
josie
was
nurse
and
i
was
aunt
lizzie
the
dolls
were
winnie
harry
and
jack
and
doreen
loo
and
harry
built
themselves
a
house
and
so
did
we
cecil
said
but
what
is
the
name
of
the
road
harry
chose
brookfield
avenue
and
harry
victoria
street
but
he
gave
in
and
loo
took
his
name
for
her
house
we
had
to
put
numbers
on
the
houses
sylvia
could
make
but
the
others
could
not
make
so
i
put
it
on
the
board
and
they
copied
it
josie
having
also
made
a
wanted
to
use
it
but
loo
objected
and
said
the
mother
is
more
important
than
the
nurse
so
josie
fixed
her
on
the
house
opposite
after
lunch
we
bathed
the
babies
and
put
them
to
sleep
and
as
it
was
time
for
the
children
own
rest
we
all
went
to
bed
when
rest
was
over
we
washed
and
dressed
and
then
harry
asked
for
clay
to
make
a
for
her
house
that
made
all
the
children
want
to
make
things
in
clay
so
we
made
cups
and
saucers
plates
and
a
bottle
then
scones
and
bread
and
a
and
one
of
the
children
said
we
must
put
a
b
on
that
then
loo
said
but
we
have
any
shelves
i
had
to
leave
my
class
in
miss
payne
charge
and
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
fitting
in
shelves
and
sinks
after
sweeping
dusting
and
washing
and
dressing
the
dolls
i
read
to
the
children
how
the
house
was
built
then
we
all
pretended
to
bake
making
rolls
and
cakes
as
next
day
was
to
be
the
doll
birthday
we
baked
our
cakes
on
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
empty
fireplace
the
other
children
were
invited
to
winnie
party
so
we
went
out
to
shop
the
children
wanted
lettuces
from
their
own
garden
but
the
grass
was
too
wet
so
we
pretended
the
shop
was
on
the
edge
of
the
grass
and
we
talked
to
imaginary
shopmen
cecil
often
exclaiming
eightpence
why
it
not
worth
it
as
neither
of
the
houses
would
hold
all
the
guests
invited
to
the
party
we
had
to
have
a
picnic
instead
i
must
see
that
sylvia
and
dorothy
do
the
sweeping
and
let
josie
bath
the
doll
she
is
very
and
i
see
that
they
give
her
the
less
attractive
occupation
i
think
too
that
the
food
question
has
played
too
large
a
part
so
if
the
children
suggest
more
cooking
i
shall
look
in
the
larder
and
say
that
really
we
must
not
buy
or
bake
as
food
goes
bad
in
hot
weather
and
we
must
not
waste
in
war
time
the
children
have
suggested
making
cushions
painting
pictures
and
making
knives
and
forks
but
we
have
not
had
time
dorothy
and
sylvia
swept
cecil
mended
the
wall
of
the
house
josie
took
the
children
down
to
the
beach
the
sand
tray
and
i
dusted
we
looked
into
the
larder
and
found
that
yesterday
greens
were
going
bad
so
decided
not
to
buy
more
then
we
took
the
babies
for
a
walk
we
noticed
how
many
nasturtiums
were
out
how
the
blackberry
bushes
were
in
flower
and
in
bud
and
the
was
in
flower
and
the
red
flowers
looked
so
pretty
in
the
green
leaves
we
looked
at
the
hollyhocks
because
i
have
told
the
children
that
they
will
grow
taller
than
i
am
and
they
are
always
wondering
how
soon
this
will
be
the
children
found
some
cherries
which
had
fallen
and
dorothy
said
how
pretty
they
were
on
the
tree
i
called
attention
to
one
branch
that
was
laden
with
fruit
and
looked
particularly
pretty
with
the
sun
shining
on
it
we
also
looked
at
the
pear
tree
and
the
almond
everything
has
come
on
so
fast
and
the
children
were
ready
to
say
it
was
because
of
the
rain
after
rest
we
went
to
the
hall
to
see
the
chickens
they
were
much
bigger
and
sylvia
said
had
bigger
wings
we
were
able
to
watch
them
drinking
how
they
hold
up
their
heads
to
let
the
water
run
down
the
rest
of
the
morning
we
made
curtains
and
the
children
loved
it
there
was
much
discussion
and
at
first
the
children
suggested
making
them
all
different
but
they
agreed
that
curtains
at
windows
were
usually
alike
and
harry
nearly
quarrelled
as
one
wanted
green
and
the
other
pink
i
suggested
trimming
the
green
with
a
strip
of
pink
and
they
were
quite
pleased
loo
and
nurse
chose
green
which
was
to
be
sewn
with
red
silk
sylvia
said
a
pattern
and
i
said
you
saw
something
red
and
green
and
she
called
out
oh
cherries
she
cut
out
a
round
of
paper
and
tried
to
sew
round
it
holding
it
in
place
with
her
other
hand
i
suggested
putting
in
a
stitch
to
hold
the
paper
cecil
was
absorbed
in
sewing
and
it
seemed
quieting
for
such
an
excitable
boy
and
good
for
his
weak
hands
one
child
said
fancy
a
boy
sewing
so
i
told
how
soldiers
and
sailors
sewed
they
sewed
just
as
they
liked
these
notes
are
continued
in
chapter
where
they
are
used
to
show
children
attitude
towards
nature
though
separated
here
for
a
special
purpose
it
is
clear
that
there
neither
is
nor
ought
to
be
any
real
separation
in
the
lives
of
the
children
their
lives
are
wholes
and
they
continually
pass
from
one
subject
to
another
because
life
and
its
circumstances
are
making
new
demands
if
it
rains
and
you
can
not
gather
the
lettuces
you
have
grown
from
seed
you
take
refuge
in
happy
pretence
if
it
clears
and
the
sun
calls
you
out
of
doors
you
take
your
for
their
walk

arthur
clough
there
has
always
been
in
the
kindergarten
since
to
froebel
the
impulse
to
create
was
a
characteristic
of
humanity
stopford
brooke
points
out
that
browning
caliban
though
almost
brute
shows
himself
human
in
that
besides
thinking
out
his
natural
religion
he
also
dramatises
and
creates
falls
to
make
something
is
solace
making
baubles
ay
and
sport
tasteth
himself
no
finer
good
i
the
world
than
trying
what
to
do
with
wit
and
strength
what
does
a
child
gain
from
his
ceaseless
attempts
at
making
answer
was
that
intellectually
through
making
he
gains
ideas
which
received
in
words
remain
mere
words
to
learn
through
life
and
action
is
more
developing
than
to
learn
through
words
expression
in
plastic
material
united
with
thought
and
speech
is
far
more
developing
than
mere
repetition
of
words
morally
it
is
through
impressing
himself
on
his
surroundings
that
the
child
reaches
the
human
attributes
of
and
one
of
the
most
important
passages
froebel
ever
wrote
is
this
the
deepest
craving
of
the
child
life
is
to
see
itself
mirrored
in
some
external
object
through
such
reflection
he
learns
to
know
his
own
activity
its
essence
direction
and
aim
and
learns
to
determine
his
activity
in
accordance
with
outer
things
such
mirroring
of
the
inner
life
is
essential
for
through
it
the
child
comes
to
and
learns
to
order
determine
and
master
himself
it
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
expression
alone
that
froebel
regards
art
and
drawing
he
takes
to
be
the
first
revelation
of
the
creative
power
within
the
child
the
very
earliest
drawing
to
which
he
refers
is
what
he
calls
sketching
the
object
on
itself
that
is
the
tracing
round
the
outlines
of
things
whereby
the
child
learns
form
by
sight
and
motor
perceptions
a
stage
on
which
montessori
has
also
laid
much
stress
besides
noting
how
children
draw
round
scissors
and
boxes
leaves
and
twigs
their
own
hands
and
even
shadows
he
sees
that
from
experimentation
with
any
pointed
stick
or
scrap
of
red
stone
or
chalk
may
come
what
cooke
called
a
language
of
line
and
now
the
horse
of
lines
the
man
of
lines
will
give
much
pleasure
after
this
it
is
true
that
whatever
a
child
knows
he
will
put
into
his
drawing
and
the
teacher
business
is
to
see
that
he
has
abundant
perceptions
and
images
to
express
another
kind
of
drawing
which
children
seem
to
find
for
themselves
is
what
they
call
making
patterns
out
of
this
came
the
chequer
drawing
now
condemned
as
injurious
to
eyesight
and
of
little
value
when
children
see
anything
rich
in
colour
the
general
cry
is
paint
it
which
is
their
way
of
taking
in
the
beauty
we
should
not
says
froebel
give
them
paints
and
brushes
inconsiderately
to
throw
about
but
give
them
the
help
they
need
and
he
describes
quite
a
sensible
lesson
given
to
boys
whose
own
painting
did
not
seem
to
paint
them
long
teachers
who
want
real
help
in
the
art
training
of
children
should
read
the
excellent
papers
by
miss
findlay
in
and
where
we
are
told
that
we
must
rescue
the
term
design
from
the
limited
uses
to
which
it
is
often
condemned
in
the
drawing
class
viz
the
construction
of
pleasing
arrangements
of
colour
and
form
for
surface
decoration
we
shall
use
it
in
its
full
popular
significance
in
constructive
work
the
term
will
cover
building
houses
making
kettles
laying
out
streets
planning
rooms
dressing
hair
as
well
as
making
patterns
for
cushion
covers
and
cathedral
windows
in
thus
widening
our
art
studies
we
shall
be
harking
back
in
a
slight
degree
to
the
kind
of
training
that
in
past
ages
produced
the
great
masters
giotto
designed
his
campanile
primarily
for
the
bells
that
were
to
summon
the
florentines
to
their
cathedral
the
venetians
wanted
façades
for
their
palaces
and
made
façades
to
delight
their
eyes
the
japanese
have
wanted
small
furniture
for
their
small
rooms
and
have
developed
wonderful
skill
and
taste
in
designing
it
neither
art
nor
science
can
remain
long
afloat
in
high
abstract
regions
above
the
needs
and
interests
of
human
life
to
quote
clough
cathedral
pure
and
perfect
built
by
that
only
law
that
use
be
suggester
of
beauty
nothing
concealed
that
is
done
but
all
things
done
to
adornment
meanest
utilities
seized
as
occasions
to
grace
and
embellish
if
this
is
true
of
the
interests
of
the
professional
artist
much
more
must
it
be
true
of
the
art
training
of
the
child
we
must
not
then
despise
the
rough
and
ready
productions
of
a
child
nor
force
upon
him
a
standard
for
which
he
is
not
ready
before
any
other
construction
is
possible
to
him
a
child
can
with
sand
and
this
is
a
constant
joy
from
the
endless
puddings
that
are
turned
out
of
patty
pans
up
to
such
models
as
that
of
the
whole
isle
of
wight
with
its
tunnelled
cliffs
and
system
of
railways
made
by
an
boy
as
yet
innocent
of
geography
lessons
the
child
then
who
is
making
especially
making
for
use
is
to
a
certain
extent
developing
himself
as
an
artist
the
little
boys
at
keilhau
were
well
provided
with
sand
moss
to
use
with
their
building
blocks
and
it
was
a
former
keilhau
boy
who
suggested
to
his
old
master
that
some
kind
of
would
make
a
good
plaything
for
the
children
in
his
new
kindergarten
miss
wiggin
tells
us
that
indirectly
we
owe
the
children
in
the
public
parks
to
froebel
since
these
were
the
result
of
a
suggestion
made
by
frau
schrader
to
the
empress
frederick
and
the
idea
was
carried
out
during
her
husband
too
brief
reign
another
very
early
making
is
the
arranging
of
furniture
for
shops
carriages
trains
and
the
ships
upon
the
stairs
which
made
bright
pictures
in
stevenson
memory
building
blocks
are
truly
as
froebel
puts
it
the
finest
and
most
variable
material
that
can
be
offered
a
boy
for
purposes
of
representation
the
little
boxes
associated
with
the
kindergarten
were
originally
planned
for
the
use
of
nursery
children
two
to
three
years
of
age
and
in
most
if
not
in
all
kindergartens
these
have
been
replaced
by
larger
bricks
it
is
many
years
now
since
at
miss
payne
suggestion
we
bought
some
hundreds
of
road
paving
blocks
and
these
are
such
a
source
of
pleasure
that
the
children
often
dream
about
them
living
out
the
life
around
presents
much
opportunity
for
making
which
may
be
done
with
blocks
but
which
even
in
the
kindergarten
can
be
done
with
tools
care
must
be
exercised
but
children
have
quite
a
strong
instinct
for
and
if
shown
how
real
workmen
handle
their
tools
they
are
often
more
careful
than
at
a
much
later
stage
to
make
a
workable
railway
signal
is
more
interesting
and
much
more
educative
than
to
use
one
that
came
from
a
shop
the
teacher
may
make
illuminating
discoveries
in
the
process
as
when
one
set
of
children
desired
to
make
a
counter
for
a
shop
and
arranged
their
piece
of
wood
vertically
so
that
the
counter
had
no
top
it
was
found
that
to
these
very
little
people
the
most
important
part
was
the
high
front
against
which
they
were
accustomed
to
stand
not
the
flat
top
which
they
seldom
saw
another
set
of
children
made
a
cart
on
which
the
farmer
was
to
carry
his
corn
and
exemplified
dewey
concrete
logic
of
action
at
first
they
only
wanted
a
board
on
wheels
but
the
corn
fell
off
so
they
nailed
on
sides
but
the
cart
never
had
either
back
or
front
and
resembled
some
seen
in
early
english
pictures
any
kind
of
cooking
that
can
be
done
is
a
most
important
kind
of
making
even
the
very
little
ones
can
help
and
they
thoroughly
enjoy
watching
her
hands
were
in
the
dough
from
three
years
old
said
a
mother
so
i
taught
her
how
to
bake
and
now
at
seven
she
can
bake
as
well
as
i
can
children
delight
in
carrying
out
the
processes
involved
in
the
making
of
flour
and
they
can
easily
thrash
a
little
wheat
then
winnow
grind
between
stones
and
sift
it
their
best
efforts
produce
but
a
tiny
quantity
of
flour
but
the
experience
is
real
interest
is
great
and
a
new
significance
attaches
to
the
shop
flour
from
which
bread
is
ultimately
produced
butter
and
cheese
can
easily
be
made
also
jam
and
even
a
christmas
pudding
in
very
early
kindergartens
we
read
of
the
growing
digging
and
cooking
of
potatoes
and
of
the
extraction
of
starch
to
be
used
as
paste
special
anniversaries
require
special
making
we
possess
a
doll
of
to
whom
her
old
mother
bequeathed
her
birthday
the
doll
birthday
is
a
great
event
and
on
the
previous
day
each
class
in
turn
bakes
tiny
loaves
or
cakes
or
pastry
for
the
party
christmas
creates
a
need
for
decorations
christmas
cards
and
presents
and
empire
day
and
trafalgar
day
for
flags
while
in
many
places
there
is
an
annual
sale
on
behalf
of
a
charity
it
does
not
do
to
be
too
modern
and
to
despise
all
the
makings
which
gave
such
pleasure
some
years
ago
kindergarten
has
fallen
into
an
undeserved
oblivion
the
making
of
boats
or
from
old
newspaper
is
a
great
achievement
for
a
child
and
to
make
pigs
and
purses
corner
cupboards
and
chairs
for
paper
dolls
is
still
a
delight
and
calls
forth
real
concentration
and
effort
making
in
connection
with
some
whole
such
as
the
continuous
representation
of
life
around
us
and
at
a
later
stage
the
of
primitive
industries
or
making
which
arises
out
of
some
special
interest
may
have
a
higher
educational
value
but
apart
from
this
children
want
to
make
for
making
sake
ca
i
make
something
in
wood
like
boy
does
asked
a
little
girl
there
is
joy
in
the
making
joy
in
being
a
cause
and
for
this
the
children
need
opportunity
space
and
time
there
is
a
lesson
to
many
of
us
in
some
verses
by
miss
sharpley
lately
published
which
should
be
entitled
when
can
i
make
my
little
ship
i
like
to
cut
and
cut
and
cut
and
over
the
bare
floor
to
strew
my
papers
all
about
and
then
to
cut
some
more
i
sweep
them
up
so
neatly
too
but
mother
says
oh
no
there
is
no
time
it
seven
to
bed
you
quickly
go
in
school
i
just
begun
to
make
a
pretty
little
ship
but
i
was
slow
and
all
the
rest
stood
up
to
dance
and
skip
when
shall
i
make
my
little
ship
at
home
there
is
no
gloy
and
father
builds
it
by
himself

goes
to
buy

i
care
not
who
makes
the
textbooks
stanley
hall
is
it
bible
story
or
any
of
a
story
was
the
greeting
of
an
eager
child
one
morning
usually
they
were
persuading
him
to
tell
stories
writes
ebers
from
his
recollections
of
froebel
as
an
old
man
at
keilhau
he
was
never
seen
crossing
the
courtyard
without
a
group
of
the
younger
pupils
hanging
to
his
coat
tails
and
clasping
his
arms
usually
they
were
persuading
him
to
tell
stories
and
when
he
condescended
to
do
so
the
older
ones
flocked
around
him
too
and
they
were
never
disappointed
what
fire
what
animation
the
old
man
had
retained
so
froebel
could
write
with
feeling
of
the
joyful
faces
the
sparkling
eyes
the
merry
shouts
that
welcome
the
genuine
he
had
a
right
to
pronounce
that
the
child
desire
and
craving
for
tales
for
legends
for
all
kinds
of
stories
and
later
on
for
historical
accounts
is
very
intense
surely
there
was
never
a
little
one
who
did
not
crave
for
stories
though
here
and
there
may
be
found
an
older
child
who
got
none
at
the
right
time
and
who
therefore
lost
that
most
healthy
of
appetites
most
of
us
will
agree
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
child
who
does
not
like
stories
but
it
may
be
that
the
something
wrong
belonged
to
the
mother
one
such
said
to
the
abbé
klein
one
day
my
children
have
never
asked
for
stories
but
madame
was
the
reply
neither
would
they
ask
for
cake
if
they
had
never
eaten
it
or
even
seen
it
it
is
easy
for
us
to
find
reasons
why
we
should
tell
stories
we
can
brush
aside
minor
aims
such
as
increasing
the
child
vocabulary
undoubtedly
his
vocabulary
does
increase
enormously
from
listening
to
stories
but
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
any
one
could
rise
to
real
heights
in
with
this
as
an
aim
or
end
that
the
narrator
should
clothe
his
living
story
in
words
expressive
of
its
atmosphere
and
that
the
listener
should
in
this
way
gain
such
power
over
language
that
he
too
can
fitly
express
himself
is
quite
another
matter
first
then
we
tell
stories
because
we
love
to
tell
them
and
because
the
children
love
to
listen
we
choose
stories
that
appeal
to
our
audience
it
is
something
beautiful
humorous
heroic
or
witty
that
we
have
found
and
being
social
animals
we
want
to
share
it
as
educators
with
an
aim
before
us
we
deliberately
tell
stories
in
order
to
place
before
our
children
ideals
of
unselfishness
courage
and
truth
we
know
from
our
own
experience
not
only
in
childhood
but
all
through
life
how
the
story
reaches
our
feelings
as
no
sermon
or
moralising
ever
does
and
we
have
learned
that
out
of
the
heart
are
the
issues
of
life
unguided
feelings
may
be
a
danger
but
the
story
does
more
than
rouse
feelings
it
gives
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
moral
judgement
for
the
exercise
of
judgement
upon
questions
of
right
and
wrong
feeling
is
aroused
but
it
is
not
usually
a
personal
feeling
so
judgement
is
likely
to
be
unbiassed
it
may
however
be
biassed
by
the
tone
absorbed
from
the
environment
even
in
childhood
as
when
the
mother
makes
more
of
table
etiquette
than
of
kindness
and
the
child
instead
of
condemning
jacob
refusal
to
feed
his
hungry
brother
with
the
red
pottage
as
all
natural
children
do
condemn
says
no
esau
should
have
got
it
he
asked
for
it
as
a
rule
the
children
standard
is
correct
enough
and
approval
or
condemnation
is
justly
bestowed
provided
that
the
story
has
been
chosen
to
suit
the
child
stage
of
development
one
little
girl
objected
strongly
to
macaulay
ideal
roman
who
in
rome
quarrel
spared
neither
land
nor
gold
nor
son
nor
wife
that
was
right
she
said
stoutly
he
ought
to
think
of
his
own
wife
and
children
first
she
was
satisfied
however
when
it
was
explained
to
her
that
horatius
might
be
able
to
save
many
fathers
to
many
wives
and
children
in
my
earliest
teaching
days
having
found
certain
history
stories
successful
with
children
of
seven
i
tried
the
same
with
children
of
six
but
only
once
edmund
of
east
anglia
dying
for
his
faith
fell
very
flat
what
was
the
good
of
that
said
one
little
fellow
if
you
dead
you
do
anything
but
if
you
alive
you
can
get
more
soldiers
and
win
a
victory
the
majority
of
the
class
however
seemed
to
feel
with
another
who
asked
why
did
he
promise
while
the
danes
were
there
he
need
have
kept
it
when
they
went
away
another
way
of
stating
our
aim
in
telling
stories
to
children
is
that
a
story
presents
morality
in
the
concrete
virtues
and
vices
neither
attract
nor
repel
they
simply
mean
nothing
to
a
child
until
they
are
presented
as
the
deeds
of
man
or
woman
boy
or
girl
living
and
acting
in
a
world
recognised
as
real
one
telling
story
is
that
of
the
boy
who
got
hold
of
miss
edgeworth
and
who
said
to
his
mother
mother
i
been
reading
little
merchants
and
i
know
now
how
horrid
it
is
to
cheat
and
tell
lies
i
have
been
telling
you
that
ever
since
you
could
speak
said
his
mother
to
which
the
boy
answered
yes
i
know
but
that
did
interest
me
our
children
had
been
told
the
story
of
how
the
countess
of
buchan
crowned
the
bruce
a
duty
which
should
have
been
performed
by
her
brother
the
earl
of
fife
who
however
was
too
much
afraid
of
the
wrath
of
english
edward
a
few
days
after
an
argument
arose
and
one
little
girl
was
heard
to
say
i
do
want
to
be
brave
and
a
boy
rejoined
girls
do
need
to
be
brave
i
said
which
would
you
rather
be
the
countess
who
put
the
crown
on
the
king
head
or
the
brother
who
ran
away
and
quickly
came
the
answer
oh
the
brave
countess
from
the
very
child
who
want
to
be
brave
froebel
sums
up
the
teacher
aim
in
the
words
the
telling
of
stories
is
a
truly
strengthening
it
gives
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
all
mental
powers
opportunity
for
testing
individual
judgement
and
individual
feelings
but
why
is
it
that
children
crave
for
stories
education
says
miss
blow
a
veteran
froebelian
is
a
series
of
responses
to
indicated
needs
and
undoubtedly
the
need
for
stories
is
as
pressing
as
the
need
to
explore
to
experiment
and
to
construct
what
is
the
unconscious
need
that
is
expressed
in
this
craving
why
is
this
desire
so
deeply
implanted
by
nature
so
far
no
one
seems
to
have
given
a
better
answer
than
froebel
has
done
when
he
says
that
the
desire
for
stories
comes
out
of
the
need
to
understand
life
that
it
is
in
fact
rooted
in
the
instinct
of
investigation
only
the
study
of
the
life
of
others
can
furnish
points
of
comparison
with
the
life
the
boy
himself
has
experienced
the
story
concerns
other
men
other
circumstances
other
times
and
places
yet
the
hearer
seeks
his
own
image
he
beholds
it
and
no
one
knows
that
he
sees
it
man
can
not
be
master
of
his
surroundings
till
he
investigates
and
so
gathers
knowledge
but
he
has
to
adapt
himself
not
only
to
the
physical
but
to
the
human
environment
in
which
he
lives
in
stories
of
all
kinds
children
study
human
life
in
all
kinds
of
circumstances
nay
if
the
story
is
sufficiently
graphic
they
almost
go
through
the
experiences
narrated
almost
live
the
new
life
with
very
young
children
the
most
popular
of
all
stories
is
the
the
three
bears
and
it
is
worth
a
little
analysis
a
little
girl
runs
away
and
running
away
is
a
great
temptation
to
little
girls
and
boys
as
great
an
adventure
as
running
off
to
sea
will
be
at
a
later
stage
she
goes
into
a
wood
and
meets
bears
what
else
could
you
expect
the
story
then
deals
with
really
interesting
things
porridge
basins
chairs
and
beds
the
strong
contrast
of
the
bears
voices
fascinates
children
and
just
when
retribution
might
descend
upon
her
the
heroine
escapes
and
gets
safe
home
children
revel
in
the
familiar
details
but
these
alone
would
not
suffice
there
must
be
adventure
excitement
romance
one
feels
that
southey
had
the
assistance
of
a
child
in
making
his
story
so
complete
and
we
can
hear
the
questions
how
did
the
big
bear
know
that
the
little
girl
had
tasted
his
porridge
oh
because
she
had
left
the
spoon
how
did
he
know
that
she
had
sat
in
his
chair
because
she
left
the
cushion
untidy
and
as
for
the
little
bear
chair
why
she
sat
that
right
out
that
quite
little
children
desire
fresh
experiences
or
adventures
and
really
exciting
ones
is
shown
by
the
following
stories
made
by
children
the
first
two
are
by
a
little
girl
of
the
third
is
taken
from
lady
glenconner
recently
published
sayings
of
the
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
giant
and
a
little
girl
and
he
told
a
little
girl
not
to
kiss
a
bear
acos
he
would
bite
her
and
the
little
girl
climbed
right
on
his
back
and
she
jumped
right
down
the
stairs
and
the
bear
came
walking
after
the
little
girl
and
kissing
her
and
she
called
it
a
little
bear
and
it
was
a
big
bear
immense
amusement
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
piggy
and
he
was
right
in
a
big
green
and
white
fire
and
he
did
hurt
hisself
and
told
as
a
tremendous
secret
he
touched
a
fire
with
his
handie
a
naughty
piggy
said
auntie
what
next
he
jumped
right
out
of
a
fire
auntie
can
you
smile
for
aunties
can
not
smile
when
people
are
naughty
the
third
story
is
said
to
have
been
filled
with
pauses
due
to
a
certain
slowness
of
speech
but
the
pauses
are
lit
by
the
lightning
flash
of
a
flying
eyebrow
and
the
impressive
nodding
of
a
silken
head
once
you
know
there
was
a
fight
between
a
little
pony
and
a
lion
and
the
lion
sprang
against
the
pony
and
the
pony
put
his
back
against
a
stack
and
bited
towards
the
lion
and
the
lion
rolled
over
and
the
pony
jumped
up
and
he
ran
up
and
the
pony
turned
round
and
the
lion
his
mother
felt
she
had
lost
the
thread
which
won
she
asked
which
won
he
repeated
and
after
a
moment
pause
he
said
oh
the
little
bear
this
surprising
conclusion
points
to
a
stage
when
it
is
difficult
for
a
child
to
hold
the
thread
of
a
narrative
and
at
this
stage
along
with
simple
stories
of
little
ones
like
themselves
repetition
or
accumulation
stories
seem
to
give
most
pleasure
henny
penny
and
billy
bobtail
told
by
jacobs
as
how
jack
went
to
seek
his
fortune
are
prime
favourites
repetition
of
rhythmic
phrases
has
a
great
attraction
as
in
three
little
pigs
with
its
delightful
repetition
of
little
pig
little
pig
let
me
come
in
no
no
by
the
hair
of
my
chinny
chin
chin
then
i
huff
and
i
puff
and
blow
your
house
in
very
soon
however
the
children
are
ready
for
the
or
the
orthodox
beginning
once
upon
a
time
in
a
certain
country
there
lived
fits
the
stage
when
neither
time
nor
place
is
of
any
consequence
animals
speak
well
why
not
we
can
the
fairies
accomplish
wonders
again
why
not
wonderful
things
do
happen
and
they
must
have
a
wonderful
cause
and
as
one
child
said
if
there
never
had
been
any
fairies
how
could
people
have
written
stories
about
them
goodness
is
rewarded
and
wickedness
is
punished
as
is
only
right
in
the
child
eyes
and
goodness
usually
means
kindness
the
virtue
best
understood
of
children
obedience
is
no
doubt
the
nursery
virtue
in
the
eyes
of
authority
but
kindness
is
much
more
human
and
attractive
both
child
and
man
says
froebel
desire
to
know
the
significance
of
what
happens
around
them
this
is
the
foundation
of
greek
choruses
especially
in
tragedy
and
of
many
productions
in
the
realm
of
legends
and
it
is
the
result
of
the
consciousness
the
slumbering
premonition
of
being
surrounded
by
that
which
is
higher
and
more
conscious
than
ourselves
the
fairy
tale
is
the
child
mystery
land
his
recognition
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
or
in
our
science
montessori
protests
against
the
idea
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
religious
sense
saying
that
faith
and
fable
are
as
the
poles
apart
she
does
not
understand
that
it
is
for
their
truth
that
we
value
the
truths
they
teach
are
such
as
that
courage
and
intelligence
can
conquer
brute
strength
that
love
can
brave
and
can
overcome
all
dangers
and
always
finds
the
lost
that
kindness
begets
kindness
and
always
wins
in
the
end
the
good
and
the
faithful
marries
the
princess
or
the
prince
and
lives
happy
ever
after
and
assuredly
if
he
does
not
marry
his
princess
he
will
not
live
happy
and
if
she
does
not
marry
the
prince
she
will
live
in
no
beautiful
palace
and
there
is
more
take
for
instance
the
story
of
toads
and
diamonds
the
courteous
maiden
who
goes
down
the
well
who
gives
help
where
it
is
needed
and
who
works
faithfully
for
mother
holle
comes
home
again
dropping
gold
and
diamonds
when
she
speaks
her
silence
may
be
silver
but
her
speech
is
golden
and
her
words
give
light
in
dark
places
the
selfish
and
lazy
girl
who
refuses
help
and
whose
work
is
unfaithful
and
only
done
for
reward
has
her
reward
henceforth
when
she
speaks
down
fall
toads
and
snakes
her
words
are
cold
as
she
is
they
may
glitter
but
they
sting
footnote
this
version
is
probably
a
mixture
of
the
versions
of
perrault
and
grimm
but
mother
holle
shaking
her
feathers
is
worth
bringing
in
and
give
wholesome
food
to
the
desire
for
adventure
whereas
in
what
we
may
call
realistic
stories
adventure
is
chiefly
confined
to
the
naughty
child
who
is
therefore
more
attractive
than
the
good
and
stodgy
even
among
we
may
select
beauty
and
the
beast
and
the
sleeping
beauty
and
and
are
distinctly
preferable
to
jack
the
giant
killer
or
puss
in
boots
while
bluebeard
can
not
be
told
it
seems
to
me
that
children
can
often
safely
read
for
themselves
stories
the
adult
can
not
well
tell
the
child
notion
of
justice
is
crude
bad
is
bad
and
whether
embodied
in
an
ogre
or
in
pharaoh
of
egypt
it
must
be
got
rid
of
put
out
of
the
story
no
child
is
sorry
for
the
giant
when
jack
axe
cleaves
the
beanstalk
and
as
for
pharaoh
well
it
a
good
thing
he
drowned
for
he
was
a
bad
man
was
he
death
means
nothing
to
children
as
a
rule
except
disappearance
when
children
can
read
for
themselves
they
will
take
from
their
stories
what
suits
their
stage
of
development
their
standard
of
judgement
and
we
need
not
interfere
even
though
they
regard
with
perfect
calm
what
seems
gruesome
to
the
adult
as
a
valuable
addition
to
the
we
may
mention
one
or
two
others
wonderful
is
a
delightful
set
of
stories
full
of
charming
pictures
though
the
writer
frances
brown
was
born
blind
ewing
stories
for
children
with
and
the
and
are
inimitable
and
her
fairy
are
very
good
but
not
for
very
young
children
her
other
stories
are
certainly
about
children
but
are
as
a
rule
written
for
adults
george
macdonald
stories
are
all
too
well
known
and
too
universally
beloved
to
need
recommendation
but
in
telling
them
the
princess
and
the
goblins
or
at
the
back
of
the
north
wind
the
young
teacher
must
remember
that
they
are
beautiful
allegories
before
she
ventures
to
tell
them
the
beginner
should
ponder
well
what
the
poet
for
these
are
prose
poems
means
and
who
is
represented
by
the
beautiful
always
old
and
always
young
or
north
wind
who
must
sink
the
ship
but
is
able
to
bear
the
cry
from
it
because
of
the
sound
of
a
song
which
seems
to
swallow
up
all
fear
and
pain
and
to
set
the
suffering
singing
it
with
the
rest
is
a
bridge
between
the
of
a
child
and
equally
wonderful
and
beautiful
of
nature
and
it
too
is
full
of
meaning
if
the
teacher
has
gained
this
the
children
will
not
lag
behind
it
was
a
child
of
backward
development
who
when
she
heard
of
mother
carey
who
made
things
make
themselves
said
oh
i
know
who
that
was
that
was
god
such
stories
must
be
spread
out
over
many
days
of
telling
but
they
gain
rather
than
lose
from
that
though
for
quite
young
children
the
stories
do
require
to
be
short
and
simple
and
often
repeated
if
children
get
plenty
of
these
the
stage
for
longer
stories
is
reached
wonderfully
soon
stories
in
which
for
example
a
drop
of
water
discusses
evaporation
and
condensation
are
not
stories
at
all
but
a
kind
of
mental
meat
lozenge
most
unsatisfying
and
probably
not
even
fulfilling
their
task
of
supplying
nourishment
in
form
of
facts
fables
usually
deal
with
the
faults
and
failings
of
and
may
be
left
for
children
to
read
for
themselves
to
extract
what
suits
them
illustrations
are
not
always
necessary
but
if
well
chosen
they
are
always
a
help
warne
has
published
some
delightfully
illustrated
stories
for
little
children
the
three
pigs
hop
o
my
thumb
beauty
and
the
beast
etc
they
are
illustrated
by
brock
and
by
leslie
brooke
and
they
really
are
illustrated
the
artists
have
enjoyed
the
stories
and
children
equally
enjoy
the
pictures
the
teacher
must
consider
what
ideas
she
is
presenting
and
whether
words
alone
can
convey
them
properly
we
must
remember
that
most
children
visualise
and
that
they
can
only
do
so
from
what
they
have
seen
so
without
illustrations
a
castle
may
be
a
suburban
house
with
nottingham
lace
curtains
and
an
aspidistra
while
perseus
or
moses
may
differ
little
from
the
child
own
father
or
brothers
again
town
children
can
not
visualise
hill
and
valley
forest
and
moor
brook
and
river
not
to
mention
jungles
and
snowfields
and
the
trackless
ocean
it
is
not
easy
to
find
pictures
to
give
any
idea
of
such
scenes
but
it
is
worth
while
to
look
for
them
and
it
is
also
worth
while
for
the
teacher
to
visualise
and
to
practise
vivid
describing
of
what
she
sees
children
of
course
only
want
description
when
it
is
really
a
part
of
the
story
as
when
tom
crosses
the
moor
descends
lewthwaite
crag
or
travels
from
brook
to
river
and
from
river
to
sea
as
to
how
a
story
should
be
told
opinions
differ
it
must
be
well
told
with
a
voice
and
with
slight
but
effective
gesture
but
the
model
should
be
the
story
as
told
in
the
home
not
the
story
told
from
a
platform
the
children
need
not
be
spellbound
all
the
time
but
should
be
free
to
ask
sensible
questions
and
to
make
childlike
comments
in
moderation
the
language
should
fit
the
subject
beautiful
thoughts
need
beauty
of
expression
high
and
noble
deeds
must
be
told
in
noble
language
a
teacher
who
wishes
to
be
a
really
good
teller
of
stories
must
herself
read
good
literature
and
she
will
do
well
not
only
to
prepare
her
stories
with
care
but
to
consider
the
language
she
uses
in
daily
life
there
is
a
happy
medium
between
pedantry
and
the
latest
variety
of
slang
and
if
daily
speech
is
careless
and
slipshod
it
is
difficult
to
change
it
for
special
occasions
our
stories
should
not
only
prepare
for
literature
they
should
be
literature
and
those
who
realise
what
the
story
may
do
for
children
will
not
grudge
time
spent
in
preparation
if
the
story
is
to
present
an
ideal
let
us
see
that
we
present
a
worthy
one
if
it
is
to
lead
the
children
to
judge
of
right
and
wrong
let
us
see
that
we
give
them
time
and
opportunity
to
judge
and
that
we
do
not
force
their
judgement
lastly
if
the
story
is
to
make
the
children
feel
let
us
see
that
the
feeling
is
on
the
right
side
that
they
shrink
from
all
that
is
mean
selfish
cruel
and
cowardly
and
sympathise
with
whatsoever
things
are
true
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
whatsoever
things
are

my
heart
leaps
up

was

when
i
shall
grow

or
let
me
die
what
is
the
real
aim
of
what
we
call
it
is
surely
to
foster
delight
in
beauty
so
that
our
hearts
shall
leap
up
at
sight
of
the

until
we
die
for
indeed
if
we
lose
that
uplift
of
the
heart
some
part
of
us
has
died
already

even
wordsworth
mourns
that
nothing
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
splendour
in
the
grass
and
glory
in
the
flower
in
its
answer
to
the
question
what
is
the
chief
end
of
man
the
old
shorter
catechism
has
a
grand
beginning
man
chief
end
is
to
glorify
god
and
to
enjoy
him
for
ever
do
we
lose
the
vision
because
we
are
not
bold
enough
to
take
that
enjoyment
as
our
chief
end
to
enjoy
good
is
to
enjoy
god
our
ends
or
aims
are
our
desires
and
clutton
brock
in
his
urges
teachers
to
recognise
that
the
spirit
of
man
has
three
desires
three
ends
and
that
it
can
not
be
satisfied
till
it
attains
all
three
man
desires
to
do
right
so
far
as
he
sees
it
for
the
sake
of
doing
right
he
desires
to
gain
knowledge
or
to
know
for
the
sake
of
knowing
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
he
desires
beauty
we
do
not
value
that
which
we
call
beautiful
because
it
is
true
or
because
it
is
good
but
because
it
is
beautiful
there
is
a
glory
of
the
universe
which
we
call
truth
which
we
discover
and
apprehend
and
a
glory
of
the
universe
which
we
call
beauty

we
discover

apprehend
froebel

an
inquiry
into
the

that

exist
to
make

and
nought
else

about
the
best
thing
god
invents
to
let
children
get
that
beauty
should
be
our
aim
and
they
must
get
it
in
their
own
way
life
in
and
with
nature
and
with
the
fair
silent
things
of
nature
should
be
fostered
by
parents
and
others
froebel
tells
us
as
a
chief
fulcrum
of
and
this
is
accomplished
chiefly
in
play
which
is
at
first
simply
natural
life
let
us
surmount
the
ruts
of
our
teaching
experience
and
climb
high
enough
to
look
back
upon
our
own
childhood
to
see
where
beauty
called
to
us
where
we
attained
to
beauty
among
my
own
earliest
recollections
come
a
first
view
of
the
starry
sky
and
the
discovery
of
heaven
no
one
called
attention
to
the
stars
they
spoke
themselves
to
a
child
of
four
or
five
and
declared
the
glory
of
god
heaven
was
not
on
high
among
these
glorious
stars
however
it
was
a
grassy
place
with
flowers
and
sunshine
it
had
to
be
heaven
because
you
went
through
the
cemetery
to
reach
it
and
because
it
was
so
bright
and
flowery
and
there
were
no
graves
in
it
i
never
found
it
again
because
i
had
forgotten
how
to
get
there
another
very
early
memory
is
one
of
grief
to
see
from
the
window
how
the
gardener
was
mowing
down
all
the
daisies
and
there
were
so
many
in
the
grass
and
yet
another
is
of
a
high
grassy
sunny
field
with
a
little
stream
running
far
down
below
it
was
not
really
far
and
there
was
nothing
particularly
beautiful
in
the
place
to
eyes
but
the
beholder
was
very
small
and
loved
it
dearly
to
his
art
and
blue
heaven
stevenson
might
have
added
sun
and
green
grass
for
he
knew
what
grassy
places
are
to
the
child
and
that
happy
play
in
grassy
places
might
well
be
heaven
to
the
little
one
a
most
interesting
little
book
called
is
a
kindergarten
was
published
some
years
ago
in
america
it
is
written
by
a
landscape
gardener
and
contains
most
valuable
suggestions
as
to
how
best
to
use
for
a
kindergarten
or
nursery
school
plots
of
ground
which
may
be
secured
for
that
purpose
naturally
the
writer
has
much
to
say
on
the
laying
out
and
stocking
the
available
space
to
the
best
advantage
choosing
the
most
suitable
positions
for
the
house
where
the
teacher
must
live
he
says
to
supply
the
atmosphere
of
a
home
for
animal
hutches
for
and
seesaws
for
the
necessary
shelter
for
the
children
gardens
and
for
the
lawn
for
even
on
his
smallest
plan
a
lot
we
find
room
for
a
spot
of
green
later
he
explains
that
for
this
green
one
must
use
what
will
grow
and
if
grass
will
not
perhaps
clover
will
the
way
in
which
the
trees
and
plants
are
chosen
is
most
suggestive
beauty
and
suitability
are
always
considered
but
he
remembers
his
own
youth
and
also
considers
the
special
joys
of
childhood
for
it
is
not
nature
lessons
that
come
into
his
calculations
but
the
mere
association
of
plants
and
children
so
the
birch
tree
is
chosen
partly
for
its
grace
and
beauty
but
also
because
of
its
bark
for
one
can
scribble
on
its
papery
surface
the
hazel
because
children
delight
in
the
catkins
with
their
showers
of
golden
dust
and
the
nut
hidden
in
its
cap
of
frills
and
tucks
and
he
adds
how
much
more
alluring
than
the
naked
fruit
from
the
grocer
sack
are
these
nuts
especially
when
dots
for
eyes
and
mouth
are
added
and
a
whole
little
face
is
tucked
within
this
natural
bonnet

asked
a
child
one
day
they
are
so
pretty
clearly
the

was
going
to
lessen
not

watches

does

he
does

perhaps
to
ask

questions
himself
nor
does
he
always
want
even
to
draw

or

them
mostly
he
wants
to
watch
and
perhaps
just
to
stir
them
up
a
little
if
they
do
not
perform
to
his
satisfaction
he
does
not
necessarily
mean
to

why
should

a
little
girl
once
said
to
professor
arthur
thomson
all
children
should
live
in
the
country
at
least
for
part
of
the
year
they
should
know
fields
and
gardens
and
have
intercourse
with
hens
and
chickens
cows
and
calves
sheep
and
lambs
should
make
hay
and
see
the
corn
cut
they
would
still
want
the
wisely
sympathetic
teacher
not
to
arouse
interest
that
is
not
necessary
but
to
keep
it
alive
by
keeping
pace
with
the
child
natural
development
it
is
not
merely
living
in
the
country
that
develops
the
little
child
interest
in
shape
and
colour
and
scent
into
something
deeper
people
still
spend
all
their
time
in
the
fields
and
forests
and
see
and
feel
nothing
of
the
beauties
of
nature
and
of
their
influence
on
the
human
heart
and
this
said
froebel
and
it
is
just
what
clutton
brock
is
saying
now
is
because
the
child
fails
to
find
the
same
feelings
among
adults
two
effects
follow
the
child
feels
the
want
of
sympathy
and
loses
some
respect
for
the
elder
and
also
he
loses
his
original
joy
in
nature
there
is
in
every
human
being
the
passionate
desire
for
this
to
which
it
attains
when
it
is
aware
of
beauty
and
a
passionate
delight
in
it
when
it
comes
the
child
feels
that
delight
among
spring
flowers
we
can
all
remember
how
we
felt
it
in
the
first
apprehension
of
some
new
beauty
of
the
universe
when
we
ceased
to
be
little
animals
and
became
aware
that
there
was
this
beauty
outside
us
to
be
loved
and
most
of
us
must
remember
too
the
strange
indifference
of
our
elders
they
were
not
considering
the
lilies
of
the
field
they
did
not
want
us
to
get
our
feet
wet
among
them
we
might
be
forgetting
ourselves
but
they
were
remembering
us
and
we
became
suddenly
aware
of
the
bitterness
of
life
and
the
tyranny
of
facts
now
parents
and
nurses
and
teachers
have
of
course
to
remember
children
when
they
forget
themselves
but
they
ought
to
be
aware
that
the
child
when
he
forgets
himself
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
is
passing
through
a
sacred
experience
which
will
enrich
and
glorify
the
whole
of
his
life
children
because
they
are
not
engaged
in
the
struggle
for
life
are
more
capable
of
this
aesthetic
than
they
will
afterwards
be
and
they
need
all
of
it
that
they
can
get
so
that
they
may
remember
it
and
prize
it
in
later
years
in
these
moments
they
know
what
disinterestedness
is
they
have
a
test
by
which
they
can
value
all
future
experience
and
know
the
dullness
and
staleness
of
worldly
success
therefore
it
is
a
sin
to
check
more
than
need
be
their
aesthetic
delight
ultimate
we
can
not
all
give
to
our
children
the
experiences
we
should
like
to
supply
but
if
we
are
clear
that
we
are
aiming
at
enjoyment
of
nature
and
not
at
supplying
information
we
shall
come
nearer
to
what
is
desirable
for
years
almost
since
it
opened
in
miss
reed
of
the
michaelis
free
kindergarten
has
taken
her
children
to
the
country
it
means
a
great
deal
of
work
and
responsibility
it
means
collecting
funds
and
giving
up
one
scanty
leisure
it
means
devoted
service
but
it
has
been
done
and
it
has
been
kept
up
even
during
war
time
though
with
great
difficulty
as
to
funds
because
of
the
inestimable
benefit
to
the

secured
a
country
holiday
for
her
little
ones
in
various
ways
partly
through
the
children
country
holiday
fund
but
since
the
war
she
has
been
unable
to
secure
help
of
that
kind
and
has
managed
to
take
the
children
away
to
a
country
cottage
a
paragraph
in
the
report
says
the
children
in
the
country
had
a
delightful
time
and
what
was
seen
and
done
during
their
holiday
is
still
talked
about
continually
these
joys
entered
into
all
the
work
of
the
nursery
school
and
helped
the
children
for
months
to
retain
a
breath
of
the
country
in
their
london
surroundings
they
realised
much
from

an
almost
unbelievable
thing
fishes
newts
tadpoles
were
all
met
with
and
greeted
as
friends
children
and
helpers
alike
returned
home
full
of
health
and
vigour
and
longing
for
the
next
time
one
little
maid
wept
bitterly
and
there
seemed
no
joy
in
life
at
home
until
she
came
across
the
school
rabbit
which
was
tenderly
caressed
and
consoled
her
with
memories
of
the
country
and
hopes
for
future
visits
in
the
days
when
teachers
argued
about
the
differences
between
and
one
point
insisted
upon
was
that
the
far
surpassed
the
because
it
dealt
with
life
we
have
learned
now
that
we
should
as
much
as
we
can
surround
our
children
with
life
and
growth
even
indoors
it
is
easy
to
give
the
joy
of
growing
seeds
and
bulbs
and
of
opening
chestnut
branches
without
any
cruelty
we
can
let
them
enjoy
watching
snails
and
worms
and
we
can
keep
caterpillars
or
silkworms
and
so
let
them
drink
their
fill
of
the
miracle
of
development
but
beauty
comes
to
children
in
very
different
ways
and
always
it
is
nature
though
it
may
not
be
life
children
revel
in
colour
colour
for
its
own
sake
and
should
be
allowed
to
create
it
in
a
modern
novel
there
is
a
description
of
a
mother
doing
her
washing
in
the
open
air
and
at
her
feet
sat
a
baby
intent
upon
the
assimilation
of
a
gingerbread
elephant
but
now
and
then
tugging
at
her
skirts
and
holding
up
a
fat
hand
each
time
he
was
rewarded
by
a
dab
of
soapsuds
which
she
deposited
in
his
palm
he
received
it
with
solemn
delight
watching
the
roseate
play
of
colour
as
the
bubbles
shrank
and
broke
and
the
lovely
iridescent
treasure
vanished
in
a
smear
of
dirty
wetness
while
he
looked
then
he
would
beat
his
fists
delightedly
against
his
mother
dress
and
presently
demand
another
handful
the
following
notes
from
another
student
report
show
how
this
may
spring
naturally
out
of
the
children
life
footnote
miss
edith
jones
we
were
spinning
the
teetotum
yesterday
and
it
did
not
spin
well
so
we
made
new
ones
while
the
children
were
painting
their
tops
oliver
grew
very
eager
when
he
found
he
could
fill
in
all
the
spaces
in
different
colours
but
betty
made
her
colours
very
insipid
i
want
them
to
get
the
feeling
of
beautiful
colour
so
i
shall
show
them
a
book
with
the
colours
graded
in
it
and
we
shall
each
have
a
paper
and
paint
on
it
all
the
rich
colours
we
can
think
of
the
colours
will
probably
run
into
each
other
and
so
the
children
will
get
ideas
about
the
blending
of
colours
but
i
will
watch
to
see
that
they
do
not
get
the
colour
too
wet
if
they
are
not
tired
of
painting
i
want
to
show
them
a
painted
circle
to
turn
on
a
string
and
they
can
make
these
for
themselves
using
the
colours
they
have
already
used
i
want
the
children
to
do
some
group
work
and
i
thought
we
might
make
a
village
with
shops
and
houses
under
the
trees
in
the
garden
and
have
little
men
and
women
to
represent
ourselves
the
suggestion
will
probably
have
to
come
from
the
teacher
but
the
children
will
probably
have
the
desire
when
it
is
suggested
and
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
go
on
enlarging
our
town
on
the
pattern
of
the
towns
the
children
know
if
they
want
bricks
for
their
houses
they
can
dig
clay
in
the
garden
the
children
wanted
to
make
a
so
we
carried
our
clay
outside
they
began
discussing
why
their
china
would
not
be
so
fine
as
the
china
at
home
and
i
said
the
clay
might
be
different
then
bernard
asked
what
sort
of
china
we
should
get
from
the
clay
in
the
garden
and
i
told
him
that
kind
of
clay
was
generally
made
into
bricks
and
suggested
making
bricks
from
that
we
went
on
to
the
use
of
bricks
and
we
are
going
to
dig
and
make
bricks
to
build
a
town
bernard
is
anxious
to
know
how
we
shall
make
mortar
just
then
it
started
to
rain
and
bernard
said
that
if
the
sun
kept
shining
and
it
rained
hard
enough
we
should
have
a
rainbow
and
he
wished
it
would
come
so
as
to
see
the
beautiful
colours
i
thought
this
rather
a
coincidence
and
told
him
i
had
a
book
with
all
the
rainbow
colours
in
it
they
asked
to
see
it
so
i
showed
it
and
suggested
painting
the
colours
ourselves
those
who
had
finished
their
dishes
started
and
we
talked
about
the
richness
of
the
colours
one
or
two
children
started
with
very
watery
colour
so
i
showed
them
the
book
and
began
to
paint
myself
they
all
enjoyed
it
very
much
especially
the
different
colours
made
where
the
colours
ran
into
each
other
the
results
pleased
them
and
they
are
to
be
used
as
to
sell
in
our
town
but
sybil
wants
to
have
a
toy
shop
and
she
is
going
to
make
a
painted
circle
for
it
like
the
one
i
showed
this
is
clearly
the
time
to
show
a
glass
prism
and
to
let
these
children
make
rainbows
for
themselves
to
tell
the
story
of
iris
and
to
use
any
colour
material
milton
bradley
spectrum
papers
montessori
silks
colour
top
and
anything
else
so
long
as
the
children
keep
up
their
interest
the
interest
in
colour
need
never
die
out
it
will
probably
show
itself
now
in
finer
discrimination
and
more
careful
reproduction
of
the
colours
of
flowers
and
leaves
and
the
sympathy
given
will
heighten
interest
and
increase
enjoyment
here
are
some
notes
showing
children
numerous
activities
in
a
suburban
garden
where
they
were
allowed
to
visit
a
hen
and
chickens
the
children
took
up
their
mustard
and
cress
dug
and
raked
the
ground
ready
for
transplanting
the
lettuces
after
their
rest
we
went
to
see
the
chickens
at
the
hall
the
students
hostel
and
the
hall
garden
seemed
to
them
a
wonderful
place
they
watched
the
trains
go
in
and
out
of
the
station
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
explored
all
the
side
doors
going
up
and
down
all
the
steps
and
into
the
cycle
shed
they
helped
miss
to
stir
the
soot
water
then
they
went
to
the
grassy
bank
and
ran
down
it
slid
down
it
and
rolled
down
it
they
peeped
over
the
wall
into
the
next
garden
they
peeped
through
holes
in
the
fences
and
finished
up
with
a
swing
in
the
hammock
each
child
had
twenty
swings
and
they
enjoyed
counting
in
time
with
the
swaying
of
the
hammock
and
swayed
their
own
bodies
as
they
pushed
footnote
these
notes
are
part
of
those
already
given
on
pp
another
example
of
love
and
rhythm
was
when
they
went
to
say
to
the
hen
and
chickens
and
kept
on
repeating
all
together
nodding
their
heads
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
know
if
i
should
have
let
them
do
so
much
but
i
was
not
sure
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
come
back
and
i
wanted
them
to
enjoy
the
garden
first
we
watered
the
lettuces
we
had
transplanted
and
transplanted
more
then
as
we
had
permission
to
come
again
we
took
some
of
our
lettuces
to
the
chickens
we
saw
the
mother
hen
with
one
wing
spread
right
out
and
the
children
were
much
surprised
to
see
how
large
it
was
we
looked
at
the
roses
and
saw
how
the
bud
of
yesterday
was
full
blown
the
children
again
ran
down
and
rolled
down
the
bank
and
had
turns
in
the
hammock
this
time
to
the
rhythm
of
margery
daw
sung
twice
through
and
then
counting
up
to
twenty
very
often
they
went
to
watch
the
trains
cecil
is
particularly
interested
in
them
and
wanted
to
know
how
long
was
the
time
between
he
said
three
minutes
i
guessed
nine
but
we
found
they
were
irregular
in
the
intervals
while
waiting
for
a
train
to
pass
we
played
a
game
listening
to
what
sounds
we
could
hear
a
thrush
came
and
sang
right
over
our
heads
so
the
listening
was
concentrated
on
his
song
and
we
tried
to
say
what
we
thought
he
meant
to
say
one
child
said
says
come
here
come
here
but
they
found
this
too
difficult
we
also
watched
a
boy
cleaning
the
station
windows
and
dorothy
said
beer
is
it
wonderful
that
you
can
see
through
glass
i
agreed
but
made
no
other
remark
because
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
we
rested
outside
under
an
almond
tree
i
pointed
out
how
pretty
the
sky
looked
when
you
only
saw
it
peeping
through
the
leaves
after
rest
the
children
noticed
feathery
grasses
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
gathering
them
i
suggested
that
they
should
see
how
many
kinds
they
could
find
they
found
three
but
were
not
enthusiastic
about
it
being
content
just
to
pluck
but
they
were
delighted
when
they
found
specially
long
and
beautiful
grasses
hidden
deep
under
a
leafy
bush
they
also
found
clover
leaves
and
i
told
them
its
name
and
sang
to
them
the
verse
from
bee
with
clover
he
humming
hangs
over
brushed
and
dusted
the
room
gave
fresh
water
to
the
flowers
and
then
went
to
gardening
the
children
were
delighted
to
find
ladybirds
on
the
lettuces
they
were
transplanting
and
we
also
noticed
how
the
cherries
were
ripening
they
joined
the
transition
class
for
games
later
while
playing
with
the
sand
cecil
made
a
discovery
he
said
beer
do
you
know
i
know
what
sand
is
it
little
tiny
tiny
stones
it
may
be
worth
while
to
notice
some
things
in
these
notes
first
the
pleasure
in
exploring
the
new
surroundings
and
then
the
variety
of
delights
our
landscape
gardener
mentions
that
any
slope
to
our
grounds
should
be
welcomed
for
as
we
leave
the
level
land
and
flee
to
the
mountains
to
spend
our
vacation
so
will
a
child
avoid
the
street
and
seek
the
gutter
and
the
bank
on
the
unimproved
lot
to
enjoy
its
pastime
our
own
children
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
a
bank
for
their
play
and
though
unfortunately
extension
of
buildings
has
taken
away
much
of
this
we
have
had
abundant
opportunity
to
see
the
value
of
sloping
ground
then
there
are
the
discoveries
the
feathery
grasses
especially
those
which
were
hidden
the
ladybirds
that
sand
is
really
tiny
tiny
stones
has
every
adult
noticed
that
or
is
sand
just
sand
and
the
wonder
that
we
can
see
through
glass
a
wonder
realised
by
a
little
girl
of
four
years
old
also
we
can
notice
what
the
children
did
not
desire
they
liked
listening
to
the
thrush
but
to
make
out
what
the
thrush
was
saying
was
beyond
them
they
liked
gathering
feathery
grasses
but
to
sort
these
into
different
kinds
gave
no
pleasure
though
older
children
would
have
enjoyed
trying
to
find
many
varieties
perhaps
teachers
with
a
fair
amount
of
experience
might
have
felt
like
the
beginner
who
frankly
says
i
did
say
anything
more
because
i
did
know
what
to
say
when
dorothy
discovered
the
wonderfulness
of
glass
perhaps
we
are
silent
because
the
child
has
gone
ahead
of
us
it
is
wonderful
but
we
have
never
thought
about
it
in
such
cases
we
must
as
froebel
says
become
a
learner
with
the
child
and
humbly
with
real
sympathy
and
earnestness
ask
is
it
wonderful
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
never
thought
about
it
why
do
call
it
wonderful
if
the
child
answers
it
is
well
if
not
the
teacher
can
go
on
thinking
aloud
thinking
with
the
child
let
think
what
other
things
we
can
see
through
we
can
never
understand
it
we
can
only
reach
the
fact
of
transparency
as
a
wonderful
property
of
certain
substances
and
consider
which
possess
this
magic
quality
there
is
water
of
course
and
there
is
jelly
or
gelatine
but
these
are
not
hard
they
are
not
stones
as
glass
seems
to
be
the
child
will
be
pleased
too
to
see
a
crystal
or
a
bit
of
mica
but
the
main
thing
is
that
we
should
not
imagine
we
have
disposed
of
the
wonder
by
a
mere
name
with
a
glib
oh
that
just
because
it
transparent
but
that
we
realise
and
reinforce
and
deepen
the
child
sense
of
wonderfulness
so
teacher
and
child
enter
into
the
thoughts
of
him
who
endlessly
was
teaching
above
my
spirits
utmost
reaching
what
love
can
do
in
the
leaf
or
stone
so
that
to
master
this
alone
this
done
in
the
stone
or
leaf
for
me
i
must
go
on
learning
endlessly
chapter
x
a
way
to
god
wonders
chiefly
at
himself
who
can
tell
him
what
he
is
or
how
meet
in
human
elf
coming
and
past
eternities
emerson
it
is
of
set
purpose
that
this
short
chapter
referring
to
what
we
specially
call
religion
is
placed
immediately
after
that
on
the
attitude
to
nature
the
actual
word
religion
which
to
him
expressed
being
bound
did
not
appeal
to
froebel
so
much
as
one
which
expressed
with
god
as
a
son
can
share
the
aspirations
of
his
father
so
man
a
thought
of
god
can
aspire
from
earth
level
where
blindly
creep
things
perfected
more
or
less
to
the
heaven
height
far
and
steep
but
we
begin
at
earth
level
and
a
child
religion
must
be
largely
a
natural
religion
how
to
introduce
a
child
to
religion
is
a
problem
which
must
have
many
solutions
in
froebel
original
training
course
his
kindergarten
teachers
were
to
be
trained
to
the
observation
and
care
of
the
earliest
germs
of
the
religious
instinct
in
man
these
earliest
beginnings
he
found
in
different
sources
first
come
the
relations
between
the
child
and
the
family
beginning
with
the
mother
fatherhood
and
motherhood
must
be
realised
before
the
child
can
reach
up
to
the
father
of
all
then
there
is
the
atmosphere
of
the
home
the
real
reverence
for
higher
things
if
it
exists
affects
even
a
little
child
more
than
is
usually
supposed
but
children
are
quick
to
distinguish
reality
from
mere
conventionality
though
the
distinction
is
only
half
conscious
reality
impresses
while
conventionality
is
apt
to
bore
even
to
quite
young
children
froebel
ideal
mother
would
begin
to
show
god
in
nature
some
one
put
into
the
flowers
the
scent
and
colour
that
delight
the
child
some
one
whom
he
can
not
see
the
sun
moon
and
stars
give
light
and
beauty
and
love
is
what
they
mean
to
show
this
mother
teaches
her
little
one
some
sort
of
prayer
and
the
gesture
of
reverence
the
folded
hands
affects
the
child
even
if
the
words
mean
little
or
nothing
akin
to
the
feeling
of
community
between
the
child
and
his
family
is
the
joining
in
religious
worship
in
church
the
entrance
in
a
common
life
and
the
emotional
effect
of
the
deep
tones
of
the
organ
then
there
is
the
interdependence
of
the
universe
the
baby
is
to
thank
jenny
for
his
bread
and
milk
peter
for
mowing
the
grass
for
the
cow
until
you
come
to
the
last
ring
of
all
god
father
love
for
all
next
to
this
comes
the
child
service
others
work
for
him
and
he
also
must
serve
every
age
has
its
duties
and
duties
are
not
burdens
and
it
is
necessary
that
feeling
should
have
expression
for
even
a
love
unfostered
by
action
in
form
of
service
droops
and
dies
away
there
is
also
the
desire
for
approbation
the
child
must
be
roused
to
good
by
inclination
love
and
respect
through
the
opinion
of
others
about
him
and
this
should
be
guided
until
he
learns
to
care
chiefly
for
the
approval
of
the
god
within
right
ideals
must
be
provided
religion
is
a
continually
advancing
endeavour
and
its
reward
must
not
be
a
material
reward
we
ought
to
lift
and
strengthen
human
nature
but
we
degrade
and
weaken
it
when
we
seek
to
lead
it
to
good
conduct
by
a
bait
even
if
this
bait
beckons
to
a
future
world
the
consciousness
of
having
lived
worthily
should
be
our
highest
reward
froebel
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
instead
of
teaching
the
good
will
be
happy
and
leaving
children
to
imagine
that
this
means
an
outer
or
material
happiness
we
ought
rather
to
teach
that
in
seeking
the
highest
we
may
lose
the
lower
renunciation
the
abandonment
of
the
outer
for
the
sake
of
securing
the
inner
is
the
condition
for
attaining
highest
development
dogmatic
religious
instruction
should
rather
show
that
whoever
truly
and
earnestly
seeks
the
good
must
needs
expose
himself
to
a
life
of
outer
oppression
pain
and
want
anxiety
and
care
even
a
child
though
not
a
baby
can
be
led
to
see
that
to
do
good
for
outer
reward
is
but
enlightened
selfishness
these
suggestions
are
taken
for
the
most
part
from
the
some
from
education
of
each
parent
or
teacher
must
use
what
seems
to
her
or
to
him
most
valuable
some
may
from
the
beginning
desire
to
teach
the
child
a
baby
prayer
or
at
least
to
let
him
hear
god
bless
you
others
may
prefer
to
wait
for
a
more
intelligent
stage
perhaps
when
the
child
begins
to
ask
the
invariable
questions
who
made
the
flowers
the
animals
who
made
me
if
so
we
must
remember
that
children
see
and
hear
and
think
that
often
in
thoughtless
ejaculations
or
in
those
of
heartfelt
thankfulness
children
may
hear
the
name
of
god
that
a
simple
story
may
have
something
that
stirs
thought
that
churches
are
much
in
evidence
and
that
the
conversation
of
little
playfellows
may
take
an
unexpected
turn
to
me
it
seems
a
great
mistake
to
put
before
young
children
ideas
which
are
really
beyond
the
conception
of
an
adult
there
are
many
stories
told
of
how
children
receive
teaching
about
the
omniscience
or
omnipotence
of
god
the
stories
sound
irreverent
and
are
often
repeated
as
highly
amusing
but
they
are
really
more
pathetic
miss
shinn
tells
of
one
poor
mite
who
resented
being
constantly
watched
and
said
i
will
not
be
so
tagged
and
another
said
then
i
think
he
a
very
rude
man
when
in
reply
to
her
puzzled
questions
she
was
told
that
god
could
see
her
even
in
her
bath
and
the
boy
who
said
if
i
had
done
a
thing
could
god
make
it
that
i
had
must
have
made
his
instructor
feel
somewhat
foolish
it
never
does
harm
for
us
honestly
to
confess
our
own
limitations
and
our
ignorance
and
that
is
better
than
weak
materialistic
explanations
which
after
all
explain
nothing
to
tell
a
child
that
the
great
father
is
always
grieved
when
we
are
unkind
or
cowardly
always
ready
to
help
us
and
to
put
kindness
and
bravery
into
our
hearts
that
we
know
he
has
power
to
do
that
if
we
will
let
him
but
that
his
power
is
beyond
our
understanding
to
say
that
he
is
able
to
keep
us
in
all
danger
and
that
even
if
we
are
killed
we
are
safe
in
his
keeping
surely
that
is
enough
he
who
blessed
the
children
uttered
strong
words
against
him
who
caused
the
little
ones
to
stumble
from
every
point
from
every
object
of
nature
and
life
there
is
a
way
to
god
the
things
of
nature
form
a
more
beautiful
ladder
between
heaven
and
earth
than
that
seen
by
jacob
it
is
decked
with
flowers
and
angels
with
children
eyes
beckon
us
toward
it
this
is
true
but
it
does
not
mean
that
we
are
always
to
be
trying
to
make
things
sacred
but
that
we
are
to
realise
that
all
beauty
and
all
knowledge
and
all
sympathy
are
already
sacred
and
that
to
love
such
things
is
to
love
something
whereby
the
creator
makes
himself
known
to
us
that
to
enjoy
them
is
to
enjoy
god
religion
is
not
always
explained
as
implying
the
idea
of
being
bound
but
sometimes
as
being
set
free
from
the
bonds
of
the
lower
or
animal
nature
in
this
sense
clutton
brock
may
well
call
it
a
sacred
experience
for
the
child
when
he
forgets
himself
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
if
we
could
all
rise
to
a
wider
conception
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
religion
we
should
know
that
it
comes
into
all
the
work
of
the
day
that
it
does
not
depend
alone
upon
that
special
scripture
lesson
which
may
become
mere
routine
the
greatest
teacher
of
all
taught
by
stories
and
when
any
story
deepens
our
feelings
for
human
nature
and
our
recognition
of
the
heights
to
which
it
can
rise
when
it
makes
us
long
for
faith
courage
and
love
to
go
and
do
likewise
who
shall
say
that
this
is
not
religious
teaching
teaching
which
helps
to
deliver
us
from
the
bonds
that
hamper
spiritual
ascent
many
of
us
will
feel
with
froebel
that
the
with
its
slumbering
premonition
of
being
surrounded
by
that
which
is
higher
and
more
conscious
than
ourselves
has
its
place
and
an
important
place
in
religious
development

twines
the
eternal
passion
of
song
the
very
existence
of
lullabies
not
to
mention
their
abundance
in

the
very

to

nature
of

kinds
not

musical
harmony
but
harmony
of
proportion
and
colour
and
in
urging
the
very
early
training
of
the
germs
of
all
this
he
gives
perhaps
the
chief
reason
for
training
if
these
germs
do
not
develop
and
take
shape
as
independent
formations
in
each
individual
they
at

teach
how
to
understand
and
to
recognise
those

this
is
enough
it
makes
one
life
richer
richer
by

it
is
to
the
genius
of
jacques
dalcroze
that
the
world
of
owes
some
idea
of
what
may
be
effected
by
rhythmic
training
and
dalcroze
started
his
work
with
the
same
aim
that
froebel
set
before
the
mother
that
of
making
the
child
capable
of
appreciation
capable
of
being
made
richer
by
the
lives
of
others
but
froebel
prophesied
that
far
more
than
appreciation
would
come
from
proper
rhythmic
training
and
this
dalcroze
has
amply
proved
through
movement
the
mother
tries
to
lead
the
child
to
consciousness
of
his
own
life
by
regular
rhythmic
movement
this
is
of
special
importance
she
brings
this
power
within
the
child
own
conscious
control
when
she
dandles
him
in
her
arms
in
rhythmic
movements
and
to
rhythmic
sounds
cautiously
following
the
slowly
developing
life
in
the
child
arousing
it
to
greater
activity
and
so
developing
it
those
who
regard
the
child
as
empty
who
wish
to
fill
his
mind
from
without
neglect
the
means
of
cultivation
in
word
and
tone
which
should
lead
to
a
sense
of
rhythm
and
obedience
to
law
in
all
human
expression
but
an
early
development
of
rhythmic
movement
would
prove
most
wholesome
and
would
remove
much
wilfulness
impropriety
and
coarseness
from
his
life
movements
and
action
and
would
secure
for
him
harmony
and
moderation
and
later
on
a
higher
appreciation
of
nature
music
poetry
and
art
education
of

then
is
an
aim
most
plainly
stated
higher
appreciation
of
nature
music
poetry

and
if
we
adopt
it
we
must
make
sure
that
we
start
on

road

to
that
end

from

first

rhymes
and
if
we
honestly
follow
the
methods
of
the
mother
we
shall
not
teach
these
but
say
or
sing
them
over
and
over
again
letting
the
children
select
their
favourites
and

they

version
of
the

that
these

arose
from
the
fact
that
the

being

its

the

fish

and

the

and
the
christmas
fair
we
can
supply
good
verses
for
all
these
if
we
take
pains
to
search
and
if
we
eschew
ignorant
and
unpoetic
modern
doggerel
as
we
eschew

besides
the
nursery

we

one
thing
we
should
not
neglect
and
that
is
the

sense
of
humour
for
the
very
young

is
probably
satisfied
by
the

older
children
much
enjoy
nonsense

by
lewis
carroll
or
by
lear
and
john
gilpin
is
another
favourite
it
is
a
mistake
to
keep
strictly
within
the
limits
of
a
understanding
of
the
words
what
we
want
here
as
in
the
realm
of
nature
is
joy
and
delight
the
delight
that
comes
from
musical
words
and
rhythm
as
well
as
from
the
pictures
that
may
be
called
up
even
a
child
of
four
can
enjoy
the
poetry
of
the
psalms
without
asking
for
much
understanding
the
mother
repeats
her
rhymes
and
verses
solely
to
give
pleasure
and
if
our
aim
is
the
deepening
of
appreciation
there
is
no
reason
for
leaving
the
green
and
grassy
path
that
nature
has
showed
to
the
mother
for
the
hard
and
beaten
track
of
recitation
in
our
own
kindergarten
there
has
never
been
either
rote
learning
or
recitation
the
older
children
learn
the
words
of
their
songs
but
not
to
a
stage
because
words
and
music
suggest
each
other
except
for
that
we
just
enjoy
our
verses
the
children
asking
for
their
favourites
and
getting
new
ones
sometimes
by
request
sometimes
not
anything
not
enjoyed
is
laid
aside
we
need
variety
but
everything
must
be
good
of
its
kind
and
verses
about
children
are
seldom
for
children
because
children
love
babies
they
love
where
did
you
come
from
baby
dear
but
nothing
like
tennyson
baby
wait
a
little
longer
and
especially
nothing
of
the
toddlekins
type
has
any
place
in
the
collection
of
a
child
it
is
doubtful
if
eugene
field
verses
are
really
good
enough
for
children
all
children
enjoy
singing
but
here
as
in
everything
we
must
keep
pace
with
development
or
the
older
ones
especially
the
boys
may
get
bored
by
what
suits
the
less
adventurous
in
all
cases
the
music
should
be
good
and
tuneful
modelled
not
on
the
modern
inanity
but
on
the
healthy
and
vigorous
nursery
rhyme
or
folk
song
children
also
enjoy
instrumental
music
and
will
listen
to
piano
or
violin
while
quietly
occupied
for
example
if
they
are
drawing
one
nursery
school
teacher
plays
soft
music
to
get
her
babies
to
sleep
and
our
little
ones
fidget
less
if
some
one
sings
softly
during
their
compulsory
rest
the
kindergarten
band
is
another
way
in
which
children
can
join
in
rhythm
it
came
to
us
from
miss
bishop
and
is
probably
the
music
referred
to
in
the
description
of
the
house
the
children
are
provided
with
drums
cymbals
tambourines
and
triangles
and
keep
time
to
music
played
on
the
piano
they
can
do
some
analysis
in
choosing
which
instruments
are
most
suitable
to
accompany
different
melodies
or
changes

gay

dancing
in
circles
sometimes
quite
freely

whatever
feeling
the

calls
forth
in

is
laid
on

of
fact
the
question
is
it
true
and
the
desire
for
true
stories
arise
in
the
average
child
of
seven
to
eight
years
and
at
that
age
history
stories
are
enjoyed
real
history
is
of
course
impossible
to
young
children
whose
idea
of
time
is
still
very
vague
and
whose
understanding
of
the
motives
and
actions
of
those
immediately
around
them
is
but
embryonic
they
still
crave
for
adventure
and
romance
and
they
thrill
to
deeds
of
bravery
bravery
in
the
fight
appeals
to
all
boys
and
to
most
girls
and
it
is
a
question
for
serious
consideration
how
this
admiration
is
to
be
guided
it
certainly
can
not
be
ignored
it
is
legitimate
to
admire
knights
who
ride
about
redressing
human
wrongs
fighting
dragons
and
rescuing
fair
ladies
from
wicked
giants
and
at
this
stage
there
is
no
need
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
between
history
and
legendary
literature
it
is
good
to
introduce
children
especially
boys
to
some
of
the
arthurian
legends
if
only
to
impress
the
ideal
live
pure
speak
true
right
wrong
else
wherefore
born
stories
should
always
help
children
to
understand
human
beings
men
and
women
with
desires
and
feelings
like
our
own
but
in
history
and
geography
stories
we
deal
particularly
with
people
who
are
different
from
ourselves
and
we
should
help
children
to
understand
and
to
sympathise
with
those
whose
surroundings
and
customs
are
not
ours
they
may
have
lived
centuries
ago
or
they
may
be
living
now
but
afar
off
they
may
be
far
from
us
in
time
or
space
but
our
stories
should
show
the
reasons
for
their
customs
and
actions
and
should
tend
to
lessen
the
natural
tendency
to
feel
superior
to
those
who
have
fewer
advantages
and
gradually
to
substitute
for
that
a
sense
of
responsibility
but
the
narration
of
stories
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
we
can
treat
history
our
present
minister
of
education
says
that
history
teaching
ought
to
give
discipline
in
practical
reasoning
and
help
in
forming
judgements
not
merely
in
remembering
facts
indeed
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
eliminate
dates
and
facts
by
which
of
course
he
only
meant
that
the
power
of
reasoning
the
power
of
forming
judgements
is
of
far
more
consequence
than
the
mere
possession
of
any
quantity
of
facts
and
dates
training
in
reasoning
however
must
involve
training
in
verification
of
facts
before
pronouncing
judgement
training
in
practical
reasoning
takes
a
prominent
place
in
that
form
of
history
teaching
introduced
by
professor
dewey
according
to
him
history
is
worth
nothing
unless
it
is
an
indirect
sociology
an
account
of
how
human
beings
have
learned
so
far
as
the
world
has
yet
learned
the
lesson
to
with
one
another
a
study
of
the
growth
of
society
and
what
helps
and
hinders
so
he
finds
his
beginnings
in
primitive
life
and
although
there
is
much
in
this
that
will
appeal
to
any
age
there
is
no
doubt
that
children
of
seven
to
ten
or
eleven
revel
in
this
material
if
used
at
all
it
should
be
used
as
thinking
material
here
is
man
without
tools
without
knowledge
everything
must
be
thought
out
it
does
not
do
much
good
to
hand
over
the
material
as
a
story
as
some
teachers
use
the
dopp
series
of
books
these
books
do
all
the
thinking
for
them
every
set
of
children
must
work
things
out
for
themselves
using
their
own
environments
and
their
own
advantages
the
teacher
must
read
to
be
ready
with
help
if
the
children
fail
and
also
to
be
ready
with
the
actual
problems
it
is
astonishing
how
keen
the
children
are
and
how
often
they
suggest
just
what
has
really
happened
where
there
is
space
and
the
children
can
find
branches
for
huts
clay
for
pots
the
work
is
much
easier
for
the
teacher
and
more
satisfactory
but
even
where
that
is
impossible
and
where
one
has
sometimes
to
be
content
with
miniature
reproductions
the
interest
is
most
keen
children
under
eight
can
not
really
produce
fire
from
flints
or
rubbing
sticks
nor
can
they
make
useable
woollen
threads
with
which
to
do
much
weaving
but
even
they
can
get
sparks
from
flint
make
a
little
thread
from
wool
invent
looms
and
weave
enough
to
get
the
ideas
the
romance
of
long
ago
ought
to
be
taken
advantage
of
to
deepen
respect
for
the
dignity
of
labour
our
lives
are
so
very
short
that
we
are
apt
to
get
out
of
perspective
in
the
ages
reading
and
writing
are
so
new
it
is
only
about
four
hundred
years
since
the
first
book
was
printed
in
england
the
roman
occupation
lasted
as
long
and
who
thinks
of
that
as
a
long
period
perhaps
it
is
because
we
are
in
the
reading
and
writing
age
that
our
boys
and
girls
must
become
braw
braw
clerks
instead
of
living
on
and
by
the
land
history
particularly
primitive
history
should
help
us
all
to
be
grateful
to
those
unknown
pioneers
of
the
human
race
to
whose
struggles
and
suffering
discoveries
and
energies
our
present
favoured
mode
of
existence
on
the
planet
is
due
the
more
people
realise
the
effort
that
has
preceded
them
and
made
them
possible
the
more
are
they
likely
to
endeavour
to
be
worthy
of
it
the
more
pitiful
also
will
they
feel
when
they
see
individuals
failing
in
the
struggle
upward
and
falling
back
toward
a
brute
condition
and
the
more
hopeful
they
will
ultimately
become
for
the
brilliant
future
of
a
race
which
from
such
lowly
and
unpromising
beginnings
has
produced
the
material
vehicle
necessary
for
those
great
men
who
flourished
in
the
recent
period
which
we
speak
of
as
antiquity
footnote
substance
of
p
professor
dewey
urges
that
the
industrial
history
of
man
is
not
a
materialistic
or
merely
utilitarian
affair
but
a
matter
of
intelligence
a
record
of
how
men
learned
to
think
and
also
an
ethical
record
the
account
of
the
conditions
which
men
have
patiently
wrought
out
to
serve
their
ends
this
interest
in
how
human
beings
have
created
themselves
and
their
surroundings
ought
to
be
deeply
interesting
to
any
and
every
age
young
children
can
reach
so
little
that
one
hopes
the
interest
aroused
will
be
lasting
and
lead
to
fruitful
work
later
but
it
certainly
makes
a
good
foundation
for
the
study
of
history
and
geography
if
history
is
treated
as
sociology
and
if
geography
is
recognised
as
the
study
of
man
in
his
environment
coming
now
to
practical
details
in
our
own
work
we
have
followed
fairly
closely
the
suggestions
made
by
professor
dewey
but
everything
must
vary
from
year
to
year
according
to
the
suggestions
of
the
children
or
their
apparent
needs
one
extra
step
we
have
found
necessary
and
that
is
to
spend
some
time
over
a
desert
island
or
robinson
crusoe
stage
some
children
can
do
without
it
but
all
enjoy
it
and
the
duller
children
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
a
time
when
you
could
buy
it
in
a
shop
does
not
fit
all
difficulties
they
can
easily
grasp
the
idea
of
sailing
away
to
a
land
where
no
man
had
ever
been
before
and
playing
at
desert
island
has
always
been
a
joy
the
for
primitive
life
have
been
various
sometimes
the
work
has
found
its
beginning
in
chance
conversation
as
when
a
child
asked
are
men
animals
and
the
class
took
to
the
suggestion
that
man
meant
thinking
animal
and
began
to
consider
what
he
had
thought
often
after
robinson
crusoe
there
has
been
a
direct
question
how
did
robinson
crusoe
know
how
to
make
his
things
had
any
one
taught
him
who
made
the
things
he
had
seen
who
made
the
very
first
and
how
did
he
know
one
answer
invariably
comes
god
taught
them
which
can
be
met
by
saying
this
is
true
but
that
god
teaches
by
putting
things
into
the
world
and
giving
men
power
to
think
this
leads
to
a
discussion
about
things
natural
what
god
makes
and
what
man
makes
which
is
sometimes
illuminating
on
the
limited
conceptions
of
town
children
years
ago
we
named
primitive
man
the
people
and
the
title
has
seemed
to
give
satisfaction
though
once
we
had
the
suggestion
of
men
we
always
start
with
the
need
for
food
and
the
children
suggest
all
the
wild
fruits
they
know
often
leaving
out
nuts
till
asked
if
there
is
anything
that
can
be
stored
for
winter
roots
are
not
always
given
but
buds
of
trees
is
a
frequent
answer
children
in
the
country
ought
to
explore
and
to
dig
and
in
our
own
playground
we
find
at
least
wild
barley
blackberries
of
a
sort
cherries
hard
pears
almonds
and
cherry
gum
killing
animals
for
food
is
suggested
and
the
children
have
to
be
told
that
the
animals
were
fierce
and
to
realise
that
in
these
times
man
was
hunted
not
hunter
little
heads
are
quite
ready
to
tackle
the
problem
of
defence
and
attack
they
could
throw
stones
use
sticks
that
the
wind
blew
down
pull
up
a
young
tree
or
a
lot
of
people
could
hang
on
to
a
branch
and
get
it
down
when
one
child
suggested
finding
a
dead
animal
and
using
it
for
food
some
were
disgusted
but
a
little
girl
said
i
do
suppose
they
would
mind
they
would
be
very
particular
the
idea
of
throwing
stones
starts
the
examination
of
different
kinds
which
have
to
be
provided
for
the
purpose
flint
is
invariably
selected
and
for
months
the
children
keep
bringing
lovely
sharp
flints
but
there
is
much
careful
observation
observation
which
has
a
motive
i
would
put
a
stone
in
a
stick
and
chuck
it
at
them
is
followed
by
much
experiment
at
fixing
string
is
of
course
taboo
but
bass
is
allowed
because
it
grows
also
strips
of
skin
we
very
often
get
the
suggestion
they
might
find
a
stone
with
a
hole
in
it
which
leads
to
renewed
searching
and
to
the
endeavour
to
make
holes
to
make
a
hole
in
flint
is
beyond
us
but
in
a
softer
stone
it
can
be
done
then
may
come
the
question
of
safety
and
and
how
to
manage
with
the
babies
children
generally
know
that
tiny
babies
can
hold
very
tight
and
have
various
ideas
for
the
mother
how
to
keep
the
baby
from
falling
brings
the
idea
of
twisting
in
extra
branches
which
is
recognised
as
a
cradle
in
the
tree
and
the
children
delight
in
this
as
a
meaning
for
baby
in
the
the
possibility
of
comes
in
and
various
experiments
are
made
sometimes
in
miniature
sometimes
in
the
garden
out
of
this
comes
the
discussion
of
clothes
animals
skins
is
an
invariable
suggestion
though
all
children
do
not
realise
that
what
they
call
fur
means
skin
skin
is
provided
and
much
time
is
taken
in
experimenting
to
see
if
it
can
be
cut
with
bits
of
flint
how
could
the
people
fasten
on
the
skins
brings
the
answers
by
thorns
tie
with
narrow
pieces
and
the
children
are
pleased
to
see
that
their
own
leather
belts
are
strips
or
straps
sometimes
much
time
is
taken
up
in
cutting
out
skins
to
wear
from
paper
or
cheap
calico
the
children
working
in
pairs
one
kneeling
down
while
the
other
fits
on
the
calico
to
see
where
the
head
and
legs
come
the
skins
are
painted
or
chalked
and
pictures
are
consulted
to
see
whether
the
chosen
animals
are
striped
or
spotted
it
may
be
stated
here
that
we
are
not
very
rigid
about
periods
or
climates
and
that
our
people
are
of
a
generalised
type
our
business
is
not
to
supply
correct
information
on
anthropological
questions
but
to
call
forth
thought
and
originality
to
present
opportunities
for
closer
observation
than
was
ever
evoked
by
observation
lessons
and
for
experiments
full
of
meaning
and
full
of
zest
naturally
we
do
not
despise
correct
information
but
these
children
are
very
young
and
all
this
work
is
tentative
we
are
never
dogmatic
it
is
all
do
you
think
they
might
have
or
well
i
know
what
i
should
have
done
i
should
have
and
the
teacher
reply
is
usually
suppose
we
try
children
are
apt
of
course
to
make
startling
remarks
but
it
is
only
the
teacher
who
is
startled
by
was
all
this
before
god
birthday
i
do
think
god
had
learned
to
be
very
clever
then
it
is
a
curious
fact
but
orthodox
opinion
has
only
twice
in
the
course
of
many
years
brought
up
adam
and
eve
probably
this
is
because
we
never
talk
about
the
first
man
but
about
how
things
were
discovered
the
first
time
the
question
did
come
up
miss
payne
was
taking
the
subject
and
she
suggested
that
adam
and
eve
were
never
in
this
country
which
disposed
of
difficulties
so
well
that
i
gave
the
same
answer
the
only
time
i
ever
had
to
deal
with
the
question
when
we
come
to
the
problem
of
fire
we
always
use
parts
of
miss
story
of
if
the
children
are
asked
if
they
ever
heard
of
fire
that
comes
by
itself
or
of
things
being
burned
by
fire
that
no
human
being
had
anything
to
do
with
one
or
two
are
sure
to
suggest
lightning
they
will
tell
that
lightning
sometimes
sets
trees
on
fire
that
thunderstorms
generally
come
after
hot
dry
weather
and
that
if
lightning
struck
a
tree
with
dry
stuff
about
the
fire
would
spread
and
the
people
would
run
away
a
question
from
the
teacher
as
to
what
these
people
might
think
about
it
may
bring
the
suggestion
of
a
monster
if
not
one
only
has
to
say
that
it
must
have
seemed
as
if
it
was
eating
the
trees
to
get
they
would
think
it
was
a
dreadful
animal
then
the
story
can
be
told
of
how
the
boy
called
bodo
stopped
to
look
and
saw
the
monster
grow
smaller
so
he
went
closer
fed
it
on
wood
and
liked
to
feel
its
warm
breath
after
the
heavy
rain
that
follows
thunder
why
had
the
monster
grown
smaller
found
that
no
animal
would
come
near
it
and
so
on
we
never
tell
of
the
fire
country
though
sometimes
the
children
read
the
book
for
themselves
a
little
later
we
have
never
succeeded
in
making
flames
but
it
is
thrilling
to
get
sparks
from
flint
once
a
child
brought
an
old
tinder
box
with
steel
and
flint
but
even
then
we
were
not
skilful
enough
to
get
up
a
flame
still
it
is
something
to
have
tried
and
we
are
left
with
a
respectful
admiration
for
those
who
could
so
easily
do
without
matches
what
made
these
people
think
of
using
their
fire
to
cook
food
our
children
have
suggested
that
a
bit
of
raw
meat
fell
into
the
fire
by
accident
and
we
have
also
worked
it
out
in
this
way
we
were
pretending
to
warm
ourselves
by
the
fire
and
i
said
my
frozen
meat
was
so
cold
that
it
hurt
my
teeth
hold
it
to
the
fire
then
we
burned
our
fingers
and
sticks
were
suggested
but
we
sucked
the
burnt
fingers
and
i
said
it
tastes
good
and
the
children
shouted
with
glee
because
the
meat
roasted
really
then
something
was
supposed
to
drop
and
the
cry
was
gravy
catch
it
in
a
shell
dip
your
finger
in
and
let
your
baby
suck
it
a
small
shell
was
suggested
and
the
boy
who
said
and
put
a
stick
in
for
a
handle
was
dubbed
the
at
that
time
we
were
earning
names
for
ourselves
by
suggestions
we
started
with
fair
hair
curly
hair
big
teeth
long
legs
and
arrived
at
quick
runner
climber
and
even
thinker
we
have
got
at
pottery
in
a
similar
way
the
meat
was
supposed
to
be
tough
soak
it
came
at
once
and
could
you
get
hot
water
then
came
suggestions
a
stone
saucepan
scoop
out
a
stone
and
put
it
on
the
fire
build
a
stone
pan
and
fix
the
stones
with
cherry
gum
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
put
fire
under
would
be
a
kind
of
oven
when
asked
if
water
would
stay
in
the
hole
and
if
any
kind
of
earth
would
hold
water
the
answer
may
be
no
nothing
but
clay
and
you
have
to
make
that
no
you
get

my
cousin
has
a
well
and
clay
round
it
why
there
clay
in
the
playground
you
could
put
the
meat
into
a
skin
bag
or
a
basket
asked
if
the
skin
or
basket
could
be
set
on
the
fire
or
if
anything
could
be
done
to
keep
the
basket
from
catching
fire
the
answer
comes
yes
dab
clay
round
it
then
joyfully
it
would
hold
water
and
you
boil
what
would
happen
to
the
clay
when
it
was
put
on
the
fire
this
has
to
be
discovered
by
a
quick
experiment
but
the
children
readily
guess
that
when
the
hot
water
is
taken
off
the
fire
there
would
be
a
sort
of
clay
basin
then
they
could
make
more
and
plates
and
cups
experiments
depend
upon
circumstances
and
upon
the
age
of
the
children
a
thick
and
tiny
basin
put
into

hot

harden

hold

extent
even
without
glazing

elaborate
baking
may
also
be
done
i
have
found
it
convenient
to
take
weaving
as
a
bridge
to
history
stories
by
using
sir
frederick
leighton
picture
of
the
phoenicians
bartering
cloth
for
skins
with
the
early
britons
the
children
are
told
that
the
people
dressed
in
cloth
come
from
near
the
country
and
those
dressed
in
skins
are
the
people
of
this
very
country
what
would
these
people
think
of
the
cloth
they
would
think
it
was
animals
skins
and
what
would
they
do
they
feel
it
and
look
at
it
so
cloth
is
produced
and
we
pull
it
to
pieces
first
into
threads
and
then
into
hairs
and
the
children
say
the
hairs
are
like
fur
then
sheep
wool
is
produced
and
we
try
to
make
thread
attempts
at
and
then
at
weaving
last
a
long
time
and
along
with
this
come
some
history
stories
probably
arising
out
of
the
question
how
did
people
know
about
all
this
the
children
are
told
about
the
writings
of
julius
caesar
and
pictures
of
roman
ships
and
houses
are
shown
beside
pictures
of
coracles
and
dwellings
etc
old
coins
a
flint
some
roman
pottery
are
also
shown
along
with
descriptions
and
pictures
of
the
roman
villa
at
brading
and
other
roman
remains
the
children
are
thus
helped
to
realise
that
other
countries
exist
where
the
people
were
far
ahead
of
those
in
this
country
and
they
can
begin
to
understand
how
social
conditions
vary
and
how
nations
act
upon
each
other
the
work
varies
considerably
from
year
to
year
according
to
how
it
takes
hold
upon
the
children
interest
but
children
of
eight
to
nine
are
usually
considered
ready
for
broad
ideas
of
the
world
as
a
whole
and
the
inquiry
into
where
julius
caesar
came
from
and
why
he
came
gives
a
fair
start

drawing

and
will
express
all
he
wants
to
express
in
any
permanent
form
and
speech
as
froebel
says
is
the
element
in
which
he
lives
his
counting
is
of
the
simplest
and
the
main
thing
is
to
see
that
he
does
not
merely
repeat
a
series
while
he
handles
material
but
that
the
series
corresponds
with
the
objects
even
this
can
be
left
alone
if
it
seems
to
annoy
the
little
one
in
the
school
he
is
on
a
very
different
level
he
has
attained
to
the
abstract
he
can
use
signs
he
can
express
thoughts
which
he
could
not
draw
and
can
communicate
with
those
who
are
absent
he
can
read
any
letter
received
and
he
is
no
longer
dependent
on
for
stories
he
can
count
his
own
money
and
can
get
correct
change
in
small
transactions
and
he
can
probably
do
a
variety
of
sums
which
are
of
no
use
to
him
at
all
between
these
two
comes
what
froebel
called
the
transition
or
connecting
class
in
which
the
child
learns
the
meaning
of
the
signs
which
stand
for
speech
and
those
which
make
calculation
less
arduous
for
weak
memories
much
has
been
written
as
to
when
and
how
children
are
to
be
taught
to
read
some
great
authorities
would
put
it
off
till
eight
or
even
ten
stanley
hall
says
between
six
and
eight
while
montessori
teaches
children
of
five
and
even
of
four
froebel
would
have
supported
stanley
hall
and
would
wait
till
the
age
of
six
the
strongest
reason
for
keeping
children
back
from
books
is
a
physiological
one
in
the
and
physiology
of
strong
arguments
are
adduced
against
early
reading
as
very
injurious
to
eyesight
so
it
is
surprising
that
montessori
begins
so
soon
it
has
been
said
that
her
children
only
learn
to
write
not
to
read
but
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
they
can
read
what
they
write
and
therefore
can
read
other
material
footnote
macmillan
if
we
agree
not
to
begin
until
six
years
old
the
next
question
is
the
method
the
alphabetic
whereby
children
were
taught
the
letter
names
and
then
memorised
the
spelling
of
each
single
word
has
no
supporters
but
controversy
still
goes
on
as
to
whether
children
shall
begin
with
word
wholes
or
with
the
phonic
sounds
it
is
not
a
matter
of
vital
importance
for
the
children
who
begin
with
words
come
to
phonics
later
and
so
far
as
english
is
concerned
the
children
who
begin
with
phonics
can
not
go
far
without
meeting
irregularities
unless
indeed
they
are
limited
to
books
like
those
of
miss
dale
in
other
languages
which
are
phonic
the
difficulties
are
minimised
children
in
the
ordinary
elementary
schools
in
italy
though
taught
in
large
classes
can
write
long
sentences
to
dictation
in
four
or
five
months
but
in
italian
each
letter
has
its
definite
sound
and
every
letter
is
sounded
it
is
true
that
these
children
appear
to
spend
most
of
their
time
in
formal
work

back
to
about
the
variety
used
in
the
house
is
said
to
have
originated
with
jacotot
it
is
called
the
and
reading
method
froebel
own
adaptation
was
simpler
it
was
his
principle
to
begin
with
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
child
and
he
gives
his
method
in
story
form
how
lina
learned
to
write
and
read
lina
is
six
she
has
left
the
kindergarten
and
is
presently
to
attend
the
primary
school
she
notices
with
what
pleasure
her
father
perhaps
a
somewhat
exceptional
parent
receives
and
answers
letters
she
desires
to
write
and
her
mother
makes
her
say
her
own
name
carefully
noticing
first
the
open
or
vowel
sounds
and
then
by
noting
the
position
of
her
tongue
she
finds
the
closed
sounds
as
she
hears
the
sound
she
is
shown
how
to
make
it
her
father
leaves
home
at
the
right
moment
lina
writes
to
him
receives
and
is
able
to
read
his
answer
printed
like
her
own
in
roman
capitals
he
sends
her
a
picture
book
and
she
is
helped
to
see
how
the
letters
resemble
those
she
has
learned
and
the
reading
is
accomplished
in
england
the
phonic
method
best
known
is
probably
miss
dale
it
is
very
ingenious
the
analysis
is
thorough
and
the
books
are
prettily
got
up
but
to
those
who
feel
that
reading
though
a
most
valuable
tool
still
is
but
a
tool
and
one
not
needed
for
children
under
seven
the
method
seems
much
depends
upon
the
teacher
but
to
see
fifty
children
sitting
still
while
one
child
places
the
letters
in
their
places
on
the
board
suggests
a
great
deal
of
lost
time
the
system
is
also
so
rigidly
phonic
that
it
is
a
long
time
before
a
child
can
pick
up
an
ordinary
book
with
any
profit
stanley
hall
holds
that
it
is
best
to
combine
methods
and
probably
most
of
us
do
this
the
growing
agreement
is
he
says
that
there
is
no
one
and
only
orthodox
way
of
teaching
and
learning
this
greatest
and
hardest
of
all
the
arts
in
which
ear
mouth
eye
and
hand
must
each
in
turn
train
the
others
to
automatic
perfection
in
ways
hard
and
easy
by
devices
old
and
new
mechanically
and
consciously
actively
and
passively
this
is
a
great
gain
and
seems
now
secure
while
a
good
pedagogic
method
is
one
of
the
most
economic
both
of
labour
and
of
money
of
all
inventions
we
should
never
forget
that
the
brightest
children
and
indeed
most
children
if
taught
individually
or
at
home
need
but
very
few
refinements
of
method
idiots
as
seguin
first
showed
need
and
profit
greatly
by
very
elaborated
methods
in
learning
how
to
walk
feed
and
dress
themselves
which
would
only
retard
a
normal
child
above
all
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
stated
use
of
any
method
does
not
preclude
the
incidental
use
of
any
and
perhaps
of
others
an
adaptation
of
phonic
combined
with
the
word
method
can
be
found
in
by
it
is
simpler
than
miss
dale
and
being
combined
with
the
word
method
children
get
much
more
quickly
to
real
stories
stanley
hall
advocates
the
individual
teaching
of
reading
and
since
montessori
called
every
one
attention
to
this
we
have
used
it
much
more
freely
and
have
found
that
once
the
children
know
some
sounds
there
is
a
great
advantage
in
a
certain
amount
of
individual
learning
but
class
teaching
has
its
own
advantages
and
it
seems
best
to
have
a
combination
long
since
we
taught
a
boy
who
was
mentally
deficient
and
incapable
of
intelligent
analysis
by
whole
words
and
corresponding
pictures
miss
payne
has
developed
this
to
a
great
extent
it
is
practically
an
appeal
to
the
interest
in
solving
puzzles
the
children
choose
their
own
pictures
and
are
supplied
with
envelopes
containing
either
single
sounds
or
whole
words
corresponding
with
the
picture
they
lay
on
the
house
on
the
girl
on
the
pond
and
later
do
the
same
with
words
they
certainly
enjoy
it
and
no
one
is
ever
kept
waiting
sometimes
the
puzzle
is
to
set
in
order
the
words
of
a
nursery
rhyme
which
they
already
know
sometimes
it
is
to
read
and
draw
everything
mentioned
it
is
not
only
how
children
learn
to
read
that
is
important
even
more
so
is
what
they
read
much
unintelligent
reading
in
later
life
is
due
to
the
reading
primer
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
understand
children
should
read
books
as
adults
do
to
get
something
out
of
them
the
time
often
wasted
in
teaching
reading
too
soon
would
be
far
better
employed
in
cultivating
a
taste
for
good
reading
by
telling
or
reading
to
the
children
good
stories
and
verses

there
are

really
fond

number
work
there
are
not
many
of
them

would
probably
learn
more
if
they
were
left
to
themselves

are

who
are

being

that

would
probably
be

had
no

were

to

so
learn
to
recognise

they
use

any

can
make
up
a
game
in
which
scoring
is
necessary

is
a
number
game
and
one
can
score
by
using

by
fetching

are

form

for
those
who
have
no
great
visualising
power

they
combine

it
ought
to
be
remembered

certain
characteristics
of
growth
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
two
men
moved
by
very
different
impulses
founded
what
might
be
considered
the
beginnings
of
the
infant
school
for
nearly
fifty
years
their
work
grew
separately
but
now
they
are
merged
together
into
something
that
seems
to
be
permanent
in
a
bleak
lanarkshire
factory
village
in
the
south
of
scotland
robert
owen
millowner
socialist
and
welshman
found
that
unless
he
could
provide
for
the
education
of
the
children
of
his
factory
hands
no
parents
would
consent
to
settle
in
the
district
and
he
would
be
without
workers
in
his
mill
as
a
consequence
owen
found
himself
in
the
position
of
education
authority
privy
purse
and
organiser
and
he
did
not
flinch
from
the
situation
he
imposed
no
cheap
makeshift
because
he
believed
in
education
as
an
end
and
not
as
an
economic
means
a
twofold
institution
was
therefore
established
by
him
in
one
part
for
the
children
of
recognised
school
age
presumably
over
six
and
one
for
those
under
school
age
whose
only
entrance
test
was
their
ability
to
walk
it
is
with
the
latter
that
we
are
concerned
the
instructions
given
by
owen
to
the
man
and
the
women
he
chose
for
his
infant
school
may
serve
to
show
his
general
aim
the
babies
under
their
care
were
above
all
to
be
happy
to
lead
a
natural
life
outdoor
or
indoor
as
weather
permitted
learning
their
surroundings
playing
singing
dancing
not
annoyed
with
books
not
shadowed
by
the
needs
of
the
upper
school
but
living
the
life
their
age
demanded
in
the
light
of
the
education
bill
this
seems
almost
prophetic
their
guardians
were
selected
solely
on
the
grounds
of
personality
and
expected
to
work
in
the
spirit
in
which
owen
conceived
the
school
they
were
gentle
without
personal
ambition
fond
of
children
caring
only
for
their
welfare
but
the
sole
guiding
principle
was
owen
and
this
was
at
once
the
success
and
doom
of
the
school
for
the
personality
of
owen
was
thus
made
the
pivot
round
which
the
school
revolved
without
him
there
was
nothing
to
take
hold
of
very
soon
the
experiment
became
known
persons
with
the
stamp
of
authority
came
to
see
it
and
even
official
hearts
were
moved
by
the
reality
of
the
children
happiness
and
their
consequent
development
the
visitors
felt
rather
than
knew
that
the
thing
was
right
arrangements
were
made
to
establish
similar
institutions
in
london
and
after
one
or
two
experiments
a
permanent
one
was
founded
which
was
under
the
control
of
a
man
named
wilderspin
wilderspin
contribution
to
education
is
difficult
to
estimate
certainly
he
never
caught
owen
spirit
or
realised
his
simple
purpose
he
had
ambitions
reaching
beyond
the
happiness
of
the
children
and
far
from
trying
to
make
their
education
suit
their
stage
of
growth
he
sought
to
produce
the
infant
prodigy
just
as
a
contemporary
of
his
sought
to
produce
the
infant
saint
from
what
we
can
see
his
aim
was
what
he
honestly
believed
to
be
right
as
far
as
his
light
went
but
he
sought
for
no
light
beyond
his
own
and
his
outlook
was
not
so
narrow
as
his
application
was
unintelligent
owen
was
still
in
lanarkshire
to
be
consulted
rousseau
had
already
written
pestalozzi
work
was
by
this
time
fairly
well
known
in
england
the
children
were
there
to
be
studied
but
wilderspin
pursued
his
limited
and
unenlightened
work
until
the
infant
school
was
almost
a
dead
thing
in
his
hands
and
in
the
hands
of
those
who
followed
the
following
is
account
the
school
was
in
charge
of
a
master
and
a
female
assistant
presumably
his
wife
much
attention
was
given
to
training
children
in
good
personal
habits
cleanliness
tidiness
punctuality
and
to
moral
training
great
stress
was
laid
on
information
the
curriculum
included
reading
writing
arithmetic
geometry
lessons
on
common
objects
geography
singing
and
religion
and
an
effort
was
made
to
make
the
work
interesting
and
to
this
end
much
importance
was
attached
to
to
the
use
of
illustrations
to
questioning
and
exposition
while
the
memory
was
aided
by
means
of
didactic
verse
the
real
teaching
devolved
upon
the
master
and
mistress
this
was
of
two
kinds
class
teaching
to
a
section
of
the
children
of
approximately
equal
attainments
either
on
the
floor
or
in
the
and
collective
teaching
to
the
whole
school
regardless
of
age
on
the
gallery
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
in
the
year
of
owen
experiment
a
humble
educational
experiment
was
begun
by
frederick
froebel
in
a
very
small
village
in
the
heart
of
the
thuringian
forest
like
owen
his
aim
was
education
solely
for
its
own
sake
and
he
had
a
simple
faith
in
the
human
goodness
of
the
older
germany
but
he
came
to
education
as
a
philosopher
rather
than
a
social
reformer
with
a
strong
belief
in
its
power
to
improve
humanity
this
belief
remained
with
him
it
is
embodied
in
his
aim
and
leavened
all
his
work
the
first
twenty
years
of
his
experience
convinced
froebel
that
the
neglect
or
mismanagement
of
the
earliest
years
of
a
child
life
rendered
useless
all
that
was
done
later
what
came
to
owen
as
an
inspiration
grew
in
froebel
to
be
a
reasoned
truth
and
like
owen
he
put
it
into
practice
in
the
little
kindergarten
at
blankenburg
was
begun
with
the
village
children
as
pupils
the
beautiful
surroundings
of
hills
and
green
slopes
made
a
very
different
background
from
the
bleak
little
lanarkshire
village
overshadowed
by
the
factory
where
owen
school
stood
but
the
spirit
was
the
same
the
children
were
in
surroundings
suitable
for
their
growth
and
the
very
name
of
kindergarten
does
more
to
make
froebel
aim
clear
than
any
explanation
he
lived
to
see
other
kindergartens
established
in
different
parts
of
thuringia
and
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
some
of
his
teachers
came
to
england
and
did
similar
work
in
london
croydon
and
manchester
the
private
kindergarten
became
an
established
thing
and
educationalists
came
to
understand
something
of
its
meaning
in
the
london
school
board
suggested
that
the
kindergarten
system
should
be
introduced
into
their
infant
schools
and
in
doing
so
they
were
unconsciously
the
factors
in
bringing
together
the
work
initiated
by
owen
and
by
froebel
the
infant
school
of
wilderspin
already
briefly
described
was
almost
a
dead
thing
with
its
galleries
and
its
mechanical
prodigies
its
and
its
theology
now
it
was
breathed
upon
by
the
spirit
of
the
man
who
said
play
is
the
highest
phase
of
child
development
of
human
development
at
this
period
for
it
is
the
spontaneous
representation
of
the
inner
from
inner
necessity
and
impulse
play
is
the
purest
most
spiritual
activity
of
man
the
plays
of
childhood
are
the
germinal
leaves
of
all
later
life
if
the
child
is
injured
at
this
period
if
the
germinal
leaves
of
the
future
tree
of
his
life
are
marred
at
this
time
he
will
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
the
utmost
effort
grow
into
strong
manhood
it
is
perhaps
not
altogether
to
be
wondered
at
that
teachers
at
first
seized
the
apparatus
rather
than
the
spirit
of
the
kindergarten
when
we
remember
that
we
have
not
accepted
in
anything
like
its
fulness
the
teaching
of
froebel
formalism
and
materialism
always
die
slowly
play
in
the
board
school
was
interpreted
as
something
that
had
to
be
dictated
and
taught
the
gifts
occupations
and
games
were
organised
and
appeared
on
the
as
subjects
side
by
side
with
theology
and
the
combination
must
have
been
curious
but
even
with
its
formalism
the
change
was
welcome
to
the
children
at
least
they
could
use
their
hands
and
do
something
at
least
they
could
leave
their
galleries
and
dance
and
skip
even
though
the
doing
and
the
dancing
were
according
to
strict
rule
the
change
was
not
welcome
to
all
teachers
as
late
as
a
headmistress
who
was
a
product
of
the
training
of
that
time
remarked
we
have
kindergarten
on
wednesday
afternoons
and
then
it
is
over
for
the
week
but
there
were
teachers
who
saw
beneath
the
bricks
and
sticks
and
pretty
movements
who
felt
the
spiritual
side
and
kept
themselves
alive
till
greater
opportunities
came
what
was
imperishable
has
remained
the
system
of
prescribed
activities
is
nearly
dead
but
the
spirit
of
the
true
kindergarten
is
more
alive
than
ever
the
change
from
the
early
till
now
is
difficult
to
describe
because
it
is
a
growth
of
spirit
a
gradual
change
of
values
rather
than
a
change
in
outward
form
there
has
been
no
definite
throwing
off
and
no
definite
adoption
of
any
one
system
or
theory
but
the
difference
between
the
best
infant
schools
of
and
the
best
infant
schools
of
is
chiefly
a
difference
in
outlook
the
older
schools
aimed
at
copying
a
method
while
the
schools
of
are
more
concerned
with
realising
the
spirit
at
present
we
are
trying
to
reconstruct
education
for
the
new
world
after
the
war
and
so
it
is
convenient
to
regard
the
intervening
period
of
nearly
half
a
century
as
a
transition
period
during
that
time
the
education
of
the
child
under
eight
has
changed
much
more
than
the
education
of
older
children
at
least
in
the
elementary
school
and
there
have
been
certain
marked
phases
that
though
apparently
insignificant
in
themselves
have
marked
stages
of
progress
in
thought
perhaps
the
most
significant
and
most
important
of
these
was
the
effect
of
the
movement
on
the
formal
and
external
side
of
kindergarten
work
it
is
first
of
all
to
america
that
we
owe
this
to
the
pioneer
stanley
hall
and
more
especially
here
to
earl
barnes
very
slowly
but
surely
it
was
evident
to
the
more
enlightened
teachers
that
children
had
their
own
way
of
learning
and
doing
and
the
system
meant
working
against
nature
for
the
logical
method
of
presenting
material
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
was
substituted
the
psychological
method
of
watching
the
children
way
of
learning
and
developing
teachers
found
that
what
they
considered
to
be
the
simple
was
not
the
simple
to
children
what
they
took
to
be
the
known
was
the
unfamiliar
to
children
for
instance
the
simple
in
geography
in
the
adult
sense
was
the
definition
of
an
island
with
which
most
of
us
began
that
study
and
in
geometry
it
was
the
point
to
children
of
the
ordinary
type
both
are
ideas
and
not
related
to
everyday
experiences
the
known
in
arithmetic
for
example
was
to
teachers
the
previous
lesson
quite
regardless
of
the
fact
that
arithmetic
enters
into
many
problems
of
life
outside
school
the
life
in
school
and
the
life
outside
school
were
in
these
early
days
of
infant
teaching
two
separate
things
and
only
occasionally
did
a
teacher
stoop
to
take
an
example
from
everyday
life
a
little
girl
in
one
of
the
poorest
schools
brought
her
baby
to
show
her
teacher
and
proudly
displayed
the
powers
of
speech
say
a
pint
of
for
teacher
said
the
little
girl
to
the
baby
by
way
of
encouragement
to
both
this
is
the
kind
of
rude
awakening
teachers
get
from
time
to
time
when
they
realise
how
much
of
the
real
child
eludes
them
psychology
has
made
it
clear
that
life
is
a
unity
and
must
be
so
regarded
part
of
this
movement
has
resulted
in
the
slow
but
sure
death
of
formalism
large
classes
material
results
and
a
lack
of
psychology
made
formalism
the
path
of
least
resistance
painting
became
blobbing
constructive
work
was
interpreted
as
courses
of
paper
folding
cutting
tearing
books
of
these
courses
were
published
with
minute
directions
for
a
graduated
sequence
the
aim
was
obedient
imitation
on
the
part
of
the
child
and
the
imagined
virtues
accruing
to
him
in
consequence
were
good
habits
patience
accuracy
and
technical
skill
and
creativeness
were
still
only
theories
a
second
interesting
phase
of
the
transition
period
was
the
method
adopted
for
the
training
of
the
senses
from
the
days
of
comenius
till
now
the
importance
of
this
has
held
its
place
firmly
but
the
means
have
greatly
changed
pestalozzi
was
adopted
by
wilderspin
and
thoroughly
sterilised
many
teachers
still
remember
the
lessons
on
the
orange
leather
camphor
paper
sugar
in
which
the
senses
were
trained
for
only
she
came
in
contact
with
the
object
and
the
children
from
their
galleries
answered
questions
on
an
object
remote
from
most
of
their
senses
and
only
dimly
visible
to
their
eyes
similar
lessons
were
given
after
on
froebel
gift
ii
in
which
the
ball
cylinder
and
cube
were
treated
in
the
same
manner
progress
was
slow
but
sometimes
the
children
followed
nature
promptings
and
played
with
their
specimens
this
was
followed
by
books
of
where
organised
play
took
the
place
of
organised
observation
about
or
thereabouts
the
nature
study
movement
swept
over
the
schools
and
nature
specimens
then
became
the
material
for
sense
training
as
far
as
possible
each
child
had
a
specimen
and
by
the
minute
examination
of
these
stimulated
their
senses
and
stifled
their
appreciation
of
all
that
was
beautiful
question
and
answer
still
dominated
the
activity
the
poor
little
withered
snowdrop
took
the
place
of
the
dead
camphor
or
leather
but
underlying
all
the
paralysing
organisation
the
truth
was
slowly
growing
and
the
children
were
being
brought
nearer
to
real
things
a
third
phase
in
this
transition
period
is
that
known
as
correlation
most
teachers
remember
the
elaborate
programmes
of
work
that
drove
them
to
extremes
in
finding
connections
the
following

from
a

was
growing
namely
the
need
of
making
associations
and
so
unifying
the
children
lines
but
the
process
of
finding
the
truth
was
slow
and
cumbersome
a
fourth
phase
of
the
early
infant
school
was
the
strong
belief
of
both
teachers
and
inspectors
in
uniformity
of
work
and
of
results
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
this
from
the
paralysing
influences
of
payment
by
results
and
large
classes
it
was
probably
the
teachers
unconscious
expression
of
the
instinct
of
when
working
against
the
heaviest
odds
but
it
was
constantly
evident
to
the
teacher
that
any
attempt
on
a
child
part
to
be
an
individual
either
in
work
or
in
conduct
had
to
be
arrested
and
the
theory
of
individual
development
was
regarded
as
so
utopian
that
the
idea
itself
was
lost
goodness
was
synonymous
with
uniform
obedience
and
silence
naughtiness
with
individuality
spontaneity
and
desire
to
investigate
a
admonition
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
was
teacher
did
tell
you
to
do
it
that
way
that
a
naughty
way
but
such
an
attitude
of
mind
was
doubtless
generated
by
the
report
of
the
inspector
when
he
commended
a
class
by
saying
the
work
of
the
class
showed
a
satisfactory
uniformity
to
obtain
uniform
results
practice
had
to
come
before
actual
performance
and
many
weary
hours
were
spent
over
drill
in
reading
drill
in
number
drill
in
handwork
drill
in
needlework
the
extreme
point
was
reached
when
babies
of
three
had
thimble
and
needle
drill
long
before
they
began
needlework
there
were
also
conduct
drills

where
the

practised
their
conduct
before
the
visit
of
the

as
they
called
him

being
represented
as
a

set
up
on
a

there
is
a
curious
symbolism
in
the
whole
occasion
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
good
underlying
this
phase
but
it
was
there
there
is
undoubtedly
a
place
for
practice
though
not
before
performance
and
uniformity
was
undoubtedly
the
germ
of
an
ideal
all
these
phases
stand
for
both
progress
and
arrest
the
average
person
is
readier
to
accept
methods
than
investigate
principles
but
we
must
recognise
that
all
struggles
and
searchings
after
truth
have
made
the
road
of
progress
shorter
for
us
by
many
a
mile
perhaps
the
chief
cause
of
stumbling
lay
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
clearly
realised
aim
or
policy
except
that
of
material
results
there
were
many
principles
in
the
air
but
they
were
unrelated
to
each
other
and
the
conditions
of
teaching
were
likely
to
crush
the
finest
endeavours
and
to
make
impossible
a
teaching
that
could
be
called
educative
chapter

the
infant
school
of
taking
neither
the
best
nor
the
worst
but
the
average
school
of
it
will
be
profitable
to
review
shortly
where
it
stands
to
consider
how
far
it
has
learnt
the
lessons
of
experience
and
what
kind
of
ideal
it
has
set
before
itself
in
externals
there
have
been
many
improvements
modern
buildings
are
better
in
many
ways
there
is
more
space
and
light
and
the
surroundings
are
more
attractive
most
of
the
galleries
have
disappeared
but
the
furniture
consists
chiefly
of
dual
desks
fixed
and
heavy
so
that
the
arrangement
of
the
room
can
not
be
changed
the
impression
given
to
a
visitor
is
that
it
is
planned
for
listening
and
answering
except
in
the
baby
room
where
there
are
generally
light
tables
and
chairs
and
consequently
no
monotonous
rows
of
children
unless
a
teacher
arranges
them
thus
from
sheer
habit
in
each
room
is
a
high
narrow
cupboard
about
one
quarter
of
the
necessary
size
for
all
that
education
demands
most
education
authorities
provide
some
good
pictures
but
the
best
are
usually
hung
on
the
wall
behind
the
children
and
all
are
above
the
children
eye
level
oh
teacher
my
neck
do
ache
was
the
only
appreciative
remark
made
by
a
child
after
a
tour
made
of
the
school
pictures
which
were
really
beautiful
as
a
rule
the
windows
are
too
high
for
the
children
to
see
from
and
the
lower
part
is
generally
frosted
in
a
new
school
which
had
a
view
up
one
of
the
loveliest
valleys
in
great
britain
the
windows
were
of
this
description
the
head
of
the
school
explained
that
it
was
a
precaution
in
case
the
children
might
see
what
was
outside
in
other
words
they
might
make
the
mistake
of
seeing
a
real
river
valley
instead
of
listening
to
a
description
of
it
in
country
schools
of
the
older
type
the
accommodation
is
not
so
good
but
the
newer
ones
are
often
very
attractive
in
appearance
and
have
both
space
and
light
the
school
garden
is
a
common
feature
in
the
country
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
so
few
even
of
the
plot
description
are
to
be
found
in
town
schools
of
late
years
the
apparatus
has
improved
though
there
is
still
much
to
be
done
in
this
direction
instead
of
the
original
tiny
boxes
of
gifts
we
have
frequently
real
nursery
bricks
of
a
larger
and
more
varied
character
and
many
other
nursery
toys
one
of
the
best
signs
of
a
progressive
policy
is
that
large
numbers
of
toys
have
taken
the
place
of
the
big
expensive
ones
that
only
an
occasional
child
could
use
it
is
a
pity
that
the
use
of
toys
comes
to
so
sudden
an
end
and
that
learning
by
this
method
does
not
follow
the
babies
after
they
have
officially
ceased
to
be
babies
as
is
the
custom
in
real
life
one
of
the
most
striking
changes
for
the
better
is
the
evidence
of
care
of
the
children
health
of
which
some
of
the
external
signs
are
doctor
nurse
and
care
committee
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
this
respect
is
gradually
growing
in
the
schools
a
fair
number
provide
for
sleep
a
few
try
to
train
the
children
to
eat
lunch
slowly
and
carefully
and
some
try
to
arrange
for
milk
or
oil
in
the
case
of
very
delicate
children
though
these
instances
are
very
much
in
the
minority
they
represent
a
change
of
spirit
this
is
one
of
the
striking
characteristics
of
the
new
education
bill
a
legacy
from
the
old
formalism
lies
in
the
fact
that
every
room
has
a
highly
organised
except
perhaps
in
the
babies
room
where
the
actual
needs
are
sometimes
considered
first
the
morning
in
most
classes
is
occupied
with
scripture
reading
arithmetic
writing
and
some
less
formal
work
such
as
nature
lesson
or
recitation
some
form
of
physical
exercise
is
always
taken
the
afternoons
are
mostly
devoted
to
games
stories
handwork
and
singing
this
order
is
not
universal
but
the
general
principle
holds
of
taking
the
more
difficult
and
formal
subjects
in
the
morning
in
the
babies
room
some
preparation
for
reading
is
still
too
frequent
the
lessons
are
short
and
the
order
varied
but
in
one
single
morning
or
afternoon
there
is
a
bewildering
number
of
changes
some
years
ago
the
unfortunate
principle
was
laid
down
in
the
code
that
fifteen
minutes
was
sufficient
time
for
a
lesson
in
an
infant
school
and
though
this
is
not
strictly
followed
the
lessons
are
short
and
numerous
giving
an
unsettled
character
to
the
work
children
appear
to
be
swung
at
a
moment
notice
from
topic
to
topic
without
an
apparent
link
or
reason
for
example
the
day
work
may
begin
with
the
story
of
a
little
boy
sent
by
train
to
the
country
settled
at
a
farm
and
taken
out
to
see
the
and
the
soon
this
is
found
to
be
a
reading
lesson
on
words
ending
in
ow
but
after
a
short
time
the
whole
class
is
told
quite
suddenly
that
one
shilling
is
to
be
spent
at
a
shop
in
town
and
while
they
are
still
interested
in
calculating
the
change
paints
are
distributed
and
the
children
are
painting
the
bluebell
the
whole
day
is
apt
to
be
of
this
broken
character
which
certainly
does
not
make
for
training
in
mental
concentration
or
for
a
realisation
of
the
unity
of
life
some
teachers
still
aim
at
correlation
but
in
a
rather
way
others
have
entirely
discarded
it
because
of
its
strained
applications
but
nothing
very
definite
has
taken
its
place
the
curriculum
which
has
been
given
is
varied
in
character
and
sometimes
includes
a
free
period
except
in
the
babies
class
the
three
r
occupy
a
prominent
place
and
children
under
six
spend
relatively
a
great
deal
of
time
in
formal
subjects
while
children
between
six
and
seven
if
they
are
still
in
the
infant
school
are
taught
to
put
down
sums
on
paper
which
they
could
nearly
always
calculate
without
such
help
as
soon
as
a
child
can
read
well
and
work
a
fair
number
of
sums
on
paper
he
is
considered
fit
for
promotion
and
the
question
of
whether
he
understands
the
method
of
working
such
sums
is
not
considered
so
important
as
accuracy
and
quickness
the
test
of
intelligence
for
promotion
is
reading
and
number
but
it
is
really
the
test
of
convenience
so
that
large
numbers
of
children
may
be
taught
together
and
brought
against
the
laws
of
nature
to
a
uniform
standard
this
poison
of
the
promotion
and
uniformity
test
works
down
through
the
infant
school
it
can
be
seen
when
the
babies
are
diverted
from
their
natural
activities
to
learn
reading
or
when
they
are
examined
it
can
be
seen
when
a
teacher
yields
up
her
bright
children
to
fill
a
few
empty
desks
it
can
be
seen
in
the
grind
at
reading
and
formal
arithmetic
of
the
children
under
six
when
weary
and
useless
hours
are
spent
in
working
against
nature
and
precious
time
is
wasted
that
will
never
come
back
yet
we
we
believe
that
children
have
their
youth
that
they
may
play
and
that
play
is
the
purest
most
spiritual
activity
of
man
at
this
stage
childhood
the
lack
of
any
clear
aim
shows
itself
in
the
fluid
nature
of
the
term
results
to
some
teachers
it
signifies
readiness
for
promotion
or
a
piece
of
work
that
presents
a
satisfactory
external
appearance
such
as
good
writing
neat
handwork
an
orderly
game
fluent
reading
to
others
it
means
something
deeper
which
they
discover
in
some
chance
remark
of
a
child
that
marks
the
growth
of
the
spirit
or
the
awakening
of
the
interest
of
a
child
whose
development
is
late
or
the
quickened
power
of
a
child
to
express
or
evidence
of
independent
thought
and
the
power
to
use
it
in
some
piece
of
handwork
or
appreciation
of
music
or
literature
according
to
the
meaning
attached
to
the
term
results
so
the
method
of
the
teacher
must
vary
but
one
gets
the
general
impression
that
in
this
respect
matters
are
in
a
transitional
state
the
first
kind
of
teacher
is
always
a
little
uncertain
of
her
ground
and
a
little
fearful
that
she
is
not
quite
while
the
second
class
of
teacher
is
sometimes
a
little
timid
and
not
quite
sure
that
she
is
prepared
to
account
for
the
rather
subtle
and
intangible
outcome
of
her
work
the
same
transitional
character
holds
in
the
case
of
discipline
while
what
is
known
as
military
discipline
still
prevails
in
many
schools
there
are
a
very
fair
number
with
whom
the
grip
has
relaxed
but
it
is
a
courageous
teacher
that
will
admit
the
term
free
discipline
which
has
nearly
as
bad
a
reputation
as
free
thought
used
to
have
and
few
are
prepared
to
go
all
the
way
probably
the
reason
lies
in
the
vagueness
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
and
the
fact
that
its
value
is
not
clearly
realised
because
it
is
not
clearly
understood
teachers
have
not
faced
the
question
squarely
what
am
i
aiming
at
in
promoting
free
discipline
taking
a
general
view
of
the
present
school
one
gets
the
impression
of
a
constant
change
of
activity
on
the
part
of
the
children
but
very
little
change
of
position
a
good
deal
of
provision
for
general
class
interest
but
little
for
individual
interest
of
less
demand
than
formerly
for
uniformity
of
results
but
the
existence
of
a
good
deal
of
uniformity
of
method
arresting
the
teacher
own
initiative
of
very
constant
teaching
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
and
a
good
deal
of
listening
and
oral
expression
on
the
part
of
the
children
of
many
lessons
and
little
independent
individual
work
below
all
this
there
is
evident
a
very
friendly
relationship
between
the
teacher
and
the
children
a
good
deal
of
personal
knowledge
of
the
children
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
and
a
good
deal
of
affection
on
both
sides
there
is
less
fear
and
more
love
than
in
the
earlier
days
less
government
and
more
training
less
restraint
and
more
freedom
and
the
children
are
greatly
attached
to
their
school
from
consideration
of
the
foregoing
summary
it
will
be
seen
that
education
in
the
infant
school
is
a
thing
of
curious
patches
of
strength
and
weakness
of
light
and
shade
perhaps
the
greatest
weakness
is
its
lack
of
cohesion
of
unification
on
the
one
hand
we
find
much
provision
for
the
children
real
needs
much
singleness
of
purpose
in
the
teacher
work
such
a
genuine
spirit
of
desire
for
their
education
on
the
other
hand
an
unreasoning
sense
of
haste
of
pushing
on
of
introducing
prematurely
work
for
which
the
children
admittedly
are
unready
an
acceptance
of
new
things
on
popular
report
without
scientific
basis
and
a
lack
of
courage
to
maintain
the
truth
for
its
own
sake
in
the
face
of
authority
and
a
craving
to
be
modern
at
the
root
of
all
this
inconsistency
and
possibly
its
cause
is
the
lack
of
a
guiding
policy
or
aim
the
lack
of
belief
in
the
scientific
or
psychological
basis
of
education
and
consequently
the
want
of
that
strong
belief
in
absolute
truth
which
helps
the
teacher
to
pass
all
barriers
chapter
xvi
some
vital
principles
if
it
be
true
that
the
infant
school
of
suffers
from
lack
of
a
clear
basis
for
its
general
policy
it
will
be
profitable
to
have
clearly
before
us
such
principles
as
great
educators
have
found
to
be
most
vital
to
the
education
of
young
children
we
all
believe
that
we
have
an
aim
and
a
high
aim
before
us
it
has
been
variously
expressed
by
past
educationalists
but
in
the
main
they
all
agree
that
the
aim
of
education
is
conduct
in
actual
practice
however
we
act
too
often
as
if
we
only
cared
for
economic
values
if
we
are
to
live
up
to
our
educational
profession
we
must
look
our
aim
in
the
face
and
honestly
practise
what
we
believe
while
training
of
character
and
conduct
is
the
accepted
aim
for
education
in
general
to
make
this
useful
and
practical
each
teacher
must
fix
her
attention
on
how
this
ultimate
aim
affects
her
own
special
part
of
the
whole
work
by
watching
the
free
child
she
will
discover
how
best
she
can
help
him
he
knows
his
own
business
and
when
unfettered
by
advice
or
command
shows
plainly
that
he
is
chiefly
concerned
with
he
finds
himself
in
what
is
to
him
a
new
and
complex
world
of
people
and
things
actual
experience
is
the
foundation
for
complete
living
and
the
stronger
the
foundation
the
better
the
result
of
later
building
first
vital
principle
then
is
that
the
teacher
of
young
children
must
provide
life
in
miniature
that
is
she
must
provide
abundant
raw
material
and
opportunities
for
the
next
question
is
that
of
the
best
method
of
gaining
this
actual
experience
the
child
is
unaware
that
he
is
laying
foundations
he
is
only
vaguely
conscious
that
he
finds
great
pleasure
in
certain
activities
and
that
something
impels
him
in
certain
directions
he
realises
no
definite
future
he
is
content
with
the
present
he
can
not
work
for
a
purpose
other
than
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
without
this
stimulus
concentration
is
impossible
in
the
activities
of
this
stage
he
probably
assimilates
more
actual
matter
than
at
any
other
period
of
his
life
and
it
is
the
same
with
his
acquirements
of
skill
in
happy
unconsciousness
he
gains
knowledge
of
his
own
body
and
of
its
power
of
the
external
world
of
his
mother
tongue
and
of
his
relations
to
other
people
he
makes
mistakes
and
commits
faults
but
these
do
not
necessarily
cripple
or
incriminate
him
he
is
not
considered
a
social
outcast
because
he
once
kicked
or
bit
or
because
he
threw
his
milk
over
the
table
he
learns
to
balance
and
adjust
his
muscles
on
a
seesaw
when
a
fall
on
soft
grass
is
a
matter
of
little
importance
and
this
is
better
than
waiting
till
he
is
compelled
hastily
to
cross
a
river
on
a
narrow
plank
it
is
all
a
kind
of
joyous
rehearsal
of
life
which
we
call
play
we
can
force
a
child
to
passivity
to
formal
repetitions
of
knowledge
to
the
acquisition
of
that
for
which
he
has
no
apparent
need
but
we
can
never
him
by
these
things
children
do
not
play
because
they
are
young
they
have
their
youth
that
they
may
play
as
surely
as
they
have
their
legs
that
they
may
walk
second
principle
is
therefore
that
the
method
of
gaining
experience
lies
through
play
and
that
by
this
road
we
can
best
reach
the
third
principle
is
the
nature
of
the
experience
that
a
child
seeks
to
gain
the
life
he
desires
to
live
how
can
we
he
sure
that
the
surroundings
we
provide
and
the
activities
we
encourage
are
in
accord
with
children
needs
let
us
imagine
a
child
of
about
five
to
six
years
of
age
one
of
a
family
living
in
a
small
house
to
which
a
garden
is
attached
inside
he
has
the
run
of
the
house
but
keeps
his
own
toys
picture
books
and
collections
of
treasures
we
will
suppose
that
not
being
at
school
he
is
free
to
arrange
his
own
day
sometimes
alone
and
sometimes
with
other
children
or
with
his
parents
what
does
he
do
he
is
interested
in
inanimate
things
especially
in
using
them
and
so
he
plays
with
his
toys
he
builds
bricks
runs
engines
solves
simple
puzzle
pictures
asks
to
work
with
his
father
gardening
tools
or
his
mother
cooking
utensils
he
is
interested
in
the
life
of
the
garden
in
the
growing
things
in
the
snail
or
spider
he
finds
in
the
cat
dog
or
rabbit
of
the
family
he
wants
to
dig
water
and
feed
these
various
things
but
he
declines
regular
responsibility
his
interest
is
in
spurts
he
is
interested
in
sounds
both
in
those
he
can
produce
and
in
those
produced
by
others
soon
he
is
interested
in
music
he
will
listen
to
it
for
considerable
periods
and
may
join
in
it
at
first
more
especially
on
the
rhythmical
side
so
too
he
likes
the
rhythm
of
poetry
and
the
melody
sounds
of
words
he
is
interested
in
making
things
on
a
wet
day
he
will
ask
for
scissors
and
paste
or
bring
out
his
paint
box
or
chalks
on
a
fine
day
he
mixes
sand
or
mud
with
water
or
builds
a
shelter
with
poles
and
shawls
at
any
time
when
he
has
an
opportunity
he
shuts
himself
into
the
bathroom
and
experiments
with
the
taps
sails
boats
colours
water
blows
bubbles
tries
to
mix
things
wet
and
dry
he
is
interested
in
the
doings
of
other
people
in
their
conduct
and
in
his
own
he
is
more
interested
in
their
badness
than
in
their
goodness
tell
me
more
of
the
bad
things
your
children
do
said
a
little
boy
to
his
teacher
aunt
and
the
request
is
significant
and
general
we
learn
so
little
by
mere
uncontrasted
goodness
he
is
interested
in
the
words
that
clothe
narrations
and
in
their
style
he
is
impatient
of
a
change
in
form
of
an
accepted
piece
of
prose
or
poetry
he
is
hungry
for
the
sounds
of
telling
words
and
phrases
he
is
interested
in
reproducing
the
doings
of
other
people
so
that
he
may
experience
them
more
fully
and
this
involves
minute
observation
careful
and
intelligent
imitation
and
vivid
imagination
his
own
word
for
it
is
pretence
there
are
other
things
that
he
grasps
at
more
vaguely
and
later
he
is
dimly
aware
that
people
have
lived
before
and
he
is
less
dimly
aware
that
people
live
in
places
different
from
his
own
surroundings
he
realises
that
some
of
the
stories
such
as
the
fairy
stories
are
true
in
one
sense
a
sense
that
responds
to
something
within
himself
that
some
are
true
in
another
more
material
and
external
sense
one
concerned
with
things
that
really
happen
he
hears
of
black
men
and
of
ships
that
carry
people
across
the
sea
and
of
things
that
come
back
in
those
ships
he
is
interested
in
the
immaterial
world
suggested
by
the
mysteries
of
woods
and
gardens
he
has
a
dim
conception
that
there
is
some
life
beyond
the
visible
he
feels
a
power
behind
life
and
he
reveals
this
in
his
early
questions
he
is
keenly
interested
in
questions
of
birth
and
death
and
sometimes
comes
into
close
contact
with
them
he
feels
that
other
wonders
must
be
accounted
for
the
snow
thunder
and
lightning
the
colours
of
summer
the
changeful
sea
at
first
the
world
of
fairy
lore
may
satisfy
him
later
comes
the
life
of
the
undying
spirit
but
the
two
are
continuous
he
may
attend
religious
observances
and
these
may
help
or
they
may
hinder
he
is
keenly
interested
in
games
whether
they
are
games
of
physical
skill
of
mental
skill
or
games
of
pretence
here
most
especially
he
comes
into
contact
with
other
people
and
here
he
realises
some
of
the
experiences
of
social
life
such
are
the
most
usual
sides
of
life
sought
by
the
ordinary
child
and
on
such
must
we
base
the
surroundings
we
provide
for
our
children
in
school
and
the
aspects
of
life
to
which
we
introduce
them
commonly
called
subjects
of
the
curriculum
third
principle
is
therefore
evident
we
find
in
the
spontaneous
choice
the
nature
of
the
surroundings
and
of
the
activities
that
he
craves
for
in
other
words
he
makes
his
own
curriculum
and
selects
his
own
subject
the
next
consideration
is
the
atmosphere
in
which
a
child
can
best
develop
character
by
means
of
these
experiences
a
young
child
is
a
stranger
in
an
unknown
untried
country
he
has
many
strange
promptings
that
seek
for
satisfaction
he
has
strong
emotions
arising
from
his
instincts
he
feels
crudely
and
fiercely
and
he
must
act
without
delay
as
a
result
of
these
emotions
he
is
like
a
tourist
in
a
new
strange
country
fresh
and
eager
and
with
a
similar
holiday
spirit
of
adventure
the
stimulation
of
the
new
arouses
a
desire
to
interpret
to
investigate
and
to
ask
questions
it
arouses
strong
emotions
to
like
or
dislike
to
fear
to
be
curious
it
leads
to
certain
modes
of
conduct
as
a
result
of
these
emotions
picture
such
a
young
tourist
buttonholed
by
a
blasé
guide
who
had
forgotten
what
first
impressions
meant
who
insisted
on
accompanying
him
wherever
he
went
regulating
his
procedure
by
telling
him
just
what
should
be
observed
and
how
to
do
so
pouring
out
information
so
premature
as
to
be
obnoxious
correcting
his
taste
subduing
his
enthusiasm
and
modifying
even
his
behaviour
the
tourist
would
presumably
pay
off
the
unwelcome
guide
but
the
children
can
not
pay
off
the
teacher
they
can
and
do
rebel
but
docility
and
adaptability
seem
to
play
a
large
part
in
for
the
young
child
freedom
must
precede
docility
because
the
only
reasonable
and
profitable
docility
is
one
that
comes
after
initiative
and
experiment
have
been
satisfied
and
when
the
child
feels
that
he
needs
help
the
world
that
the
free
child
chooses
represents
every
side
of
life
that
he
is
ready
to
assimilate
and
his
freedom
must
be
intellectual
emotional
and
moral
freedom
in
the
school
with
the
rigidly
organised
where
the
remarks
of
the
children
provoke
the
constantly
repeated
reproach
we
are
not
talking
of
that
just
now
where
the
apparatus
is
formal
and
the
method
of
using
it
prescribed
where
home
life
and
street
life
are
ignored
where
there
are
neither
garden
nor
picture
books
where
childish
questions
are
passed
over
or
hastily
answered
where
the
room
is
full
of
desks
and
the
normal
attitude
is
sitting
where
the
teacher
is
teaching
more
often
than
the
children
are
doing
there
is
no
intellectual
freedom
where
passion
and
excitement
are
instantly
arrested
where
appreciation
for
strong
colours
fierce
punishments
loud
noises
is
killed
where
fear
is
ridiculed
where
primitive
likes
and
dislikes
are
interpreted
as
coarseness
there
is
no
emotional
freedom
a
child
must
have
these
experiences
if
he
is
to
come
to
his
own
later
this
is
not
the
time
to
stamp
out
but
only
to
deflect
and
guide
otherwise
he
becomes
a
weak
and
pale
reflection
of
his
elders
with
little
resource
or
enthusiasm
where
it
is
almost
impossible
to
be
openly
naughty
where
there
is
no
opportunity
for
choice
or
for
making
mistakes
where
control
is
all
from
the
teacher
and
has
no
place
there
is
no
moral
freedom
the
school
is
not
for
the
righteous
but
for
the
sinner
who
is
only
a
child
learning
by
experience
is
a
habit
gained
through
habits
a
child
must
acquire
the
habit
of
arresting
desire
of
holding
the
physical
side
in
check
the
habit
of
reflection
of
choice
and
most
of
all
the
habit
of
either
acting
or
holding
back
as
a
result
of
all
this
if
in
the
earliest
years
his
will
is
in
the
hands
of
others
and
he
has
the
habit
of
obedience
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
habits
then
his
development
as
a
individual
is
arrested
and
may
be
permanently
weakened
there
is
no
other
way
to
learn
life
and
build
up
an
ideal
from
the
raw
material
he
has
gained
in
other
ways
in
the
rehearsal
of
life
at
school
he
can
do
this
without
serious
harm
but
every
time
a
mode
of
conduct
is
imposed
upon
him
when
he
might
have
chosen
every
time
he
is
externally
controlled
when
he
might
have
controlled
himself
every
time
he
is
balked
in
making
a
mistake
that
would
have
been
experience
to
him
he
will
be
proportionally
less
fit
to
choose
to
exercise
to
learn
by
experience
and
these
are
the
chief
lessons
at
this
impressionable
period
fourth
principle
therefore
is
that
the
atmosphere
of
freedom
is
the
only
atmosphere
in
which
a
child
can
gain
experiences
that
will
help
to
develop
character
and
control
these
four
vital
principles
will
be
applied
to
practical
work
in
the
following
chapters
ii
practical
application
of
vital
principles
before
applying
these
principles
it
is
necessary
for
practical
considerations
to
set
out
clearly
the
various
stages
of
this
period
during
the
first
eight
years
of
life
development
is
very
rapid
and
not
always
relatively
continuous
sometimes
it
takes
leaps
and
sometimes
appears
for
a
time
to
be
quiescent
but
roughly
the
first
stage
of
a
child
developing
life
ends
when
he
can
walk
eat
more
or
less
ordinary
food
and
is
independent
of
his
mother
at
this
point
the
nursery
school
stage
begins
the
child
is
learning
for
himself
his
world
by
experience
and
through
play
he
chooses
his
raw
material
in
an
atmosphere
of
freedom
when
the
period
of
play
pure
and
simple
begins
to
grow
into
a
desire
to
do
things
better
to
learn
and
practise
for
a
more
remote
end
in
other
words
when
the
child
begins
to
be
willing
to
be
taught
the
transitional
period
from
play
to
work
begins
it
can
never
be
said
to
end
but
the
relative
amount
of
play
to
work
gradually
defines
the
life
of
the
school
and
so
the
transitional
period
merges
into
the
school
period
thus
we
are
concerned
first
with
the
nursery
school
period
which
corresponds
to
what
froebel
meant
by
his
kindergarten
and
owen
by
his
infant
school
secondly
with
the
transitional
period
which
has
been
far
too
long
neglected
or
rushed
over
and
which
roughly
corresponds
to
the
standard
of
the
elementary
school
and
thirdly
we
have
the
beginnings
of
the
junior
school
where
work
is
the
predominant
factor
in
spite
of
shakespeare
assertion
there
is
much
in
a
name
and
if
these
names
were
definitely
adopted
teachers
would
realise
better
the
nature
of
their
business
the
following
chapters
seek
to
apply
practically
the
four
vital
principles
to
these
periods
of
a
child
life
but
in
many
cases
the
transition
classes
and
the
junior
school
are
considered
together
chapter
xvii
the
need
for
experience
the
first
vital
principle
is
that
the
teacher
of
young
children
must
provide
for
them
life
in
miniature
she
must
provide
abundant
raw
material
and
opportunities
for
acquiring
experience
the
practical
translation
of
this
in
the
words
of
the
teacher
of
is
i
must
choose
furniture
and
requisition
apparatus
the
teacher
of
will
say
to
her
children
i
will
bring
the
world
into
the
school
for
you
to
learn
the
local
education
authority
of
says
we
must
build
a
school
for
instruction
the
local
education
authority
of
will
say
we
must
make
a
miniature
world
for
our
children
the
world
of
the
nursery
school
child
probably
requires
the
most
careful
thought
in
this
respect
a
large
room
with
sunlight
and
air
low
clear
windows
a
door
leading
to
a
garden
and
playground
low
cupboards
full
of
toys
pictures
light
chairs
and
tables
that
can
be
pushed
into
a
corner
stretcher
beds
equally
disposable
a
dresser
with
pretty
utensils
for
food
these
are
the
chief
requirements
for
satisfying
physical
needs
apparent
in
the
actual
room
physical
habits
will
be
considered
later
under
another
heading
outside
in
the
playground
there
should
be
opportunities
for
physical
development
for
its
own
sake
swings
giant
strides
ladders
laid
flat
slightly
sloping
planks
and
a
seesaw
should
all
be
available
for
constant
use
if
the
children
are
not
warned
or
given
constant
advice
about
their
own
safety
there
is
little
fear
of
accidents
thus
the
purely
physical
side
of
the
children
is
provided
for
the
side
that
they
are
if
healthy
quite
unconscious
of
what
else
does
experience
demand
at
this
stage
roughly
classified
the
raw
experience
of
this
stage
may
be
divided
into
the
experience
of
the
natural
world
of
living
things
the
world
of
inanimate
things
and
the
social
world
for
the
natural
world
there
should
be
the
garden
outside
with
its
trees
grass
and
flower
beds
with
its
dovecot
and
rabbit
hutch
and
possibly
a
cat
sunning
herself
on
its
paths
inside
there
will
be
plants
and
flowers
to
care
for
the
elements
especially
water
earth
and
air
are
very
dear
to
a
young
child
and
it
is
quite
possible
to
satisfy
his
cravings
with
a
large
of
and
sand
a
large
flat
bath
for
sailing
boats
and
testing
the
theory
of
sinking
and
floating
a
bin
of
clay
a
pair
of
bellows
and
several
fans
to
set
the
air
in
motion
there
is
always
the
fire
to
gaze
at
on
the
right
side
of
the
and
appreciation
of
the
beauty
of
this
element
should
be
encouraged
the
world
of
inanimate
things
includes
most
of
the
toys
that
stimulate
activity
and
give
ideas
the
chief
that
should
be
found
in
the
cupboards
round
the
walls
or
scattered
about
the
room
are
bricks
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
skittles
balls
and
bats
or
rackets
hoops
reins
spades
and
other
garden
tools
pails
and
patty
pans
for
the
pipes
for
bubbles
shells
buttons
acorns
and
any
collection
of
small
articles
for
handling
all
kinds
of
vehicles
that
can
be
pushed
such
as
carts
barrows
prams
engines
drums
and
other
musical
instruments
materials
for
construction
and
expression
such
as
chalks
boards
paints
and
paper
for
experiences
of
the
social
world
which
is
not
very
real
at
this
individualistic
period
come
the
dolls
and
doll
house
horses
and
stables
cooking
utensils
noah
ark
scales
for
a
shop
boats
soldiers
and
forts
a
very
important
item
in
this
connection
is
the
collection
of
they
must
be
chosen
with
the
greatest
care
and
only
pictures
of
such
merit
as
those
of
caldecott
leslie
brooke
and
jessie
wilcox
smith
should
be
selected
pictures
form
one
of
the
richest
sources
of
experience
at
this
stage
as
indeed
at
any
stage
of
life
and
truth
beauty
and
suggestiveness
must
be
their
chief
factors
the
toys
should
be
above
all
things
durable
and
if
possible
washable
broken
and
dirty
toys
make
immoral
children
besides
the
material
surroundings
there
are
opportunities
the
seizing
of
which
gives
valuable
experiences
these
belong
to
the
social
world
and
lie
chiefly
in
the
training
in
life
social
observances
and
the
development
of
good
habits
this
side
of
life
is
one
of
the
most
important
in
the
nursery
school
and
needs
material
help
the
lavatories
and
cloakrooms
should
be
constructed
so
that
there
is
every
chance
for
a
child
to
become
and
fastidious
the
cloakrooms
should
be
provided
with
low
pegs
boot
holes
clothes
brushes
and
shoe
brushes
there
should
be
low
basins
with
hot
and
cold
water
enamel
mugs
and
tooth
brushes
each
child
nail
brushes
plenty
of
towels
and
where
the
district
needs
it
baths
the
type
provided
by
the
middlesex
education
authority
at
greenford
avenue
school
hanwell
gives
a
shower
bath
to
a
whole
group
of
children
at
once
thus
making
a
more
frequent
bath
possible
perhaps
for
very
small
children
of
the
nursery
school
age
separate
baths
are
more
suitable
this
is
a
question
for
future
experience
on
the
part
of
teachers
there
should
be
plenty
of
time
for
the
children
to
learn
to
wash
and
dress
themselves
in
the
there
should
either
be
tablecloths
or
the
tables
should
be
capable
of
being
scrubbed
by
the
children
after
each
meal
their
almost
inevitable
lack
of
manners
at
table
gives
an
invaluable
opportunity
for
training
and
again
in
such
a
case
there
should
be
no
question
of
haste
the
meals
should
be
laid
waited
on
and
cleared
away
and
the
dishes
washed
by
the
children
themselves
and
they
should
be
responsible
for
the
general
tidiness
of
the
room
this
involves
mops
dusters
washing
bowls
brushes
and
dustpans
in
the
transition
classes
and
junior
school
the
furniture
and
apparatus
can
be
to
a
great
extent
very
much
the
same
their
difference
lying
chiefly
in
degree
it
is
a
pity
to
bring
the
age
of
toys
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
in
real
life
the
older
children
still
borrow
the
toys
of
the
younger
ones
while
there
are
some
definitely
their
own
such
are
jigsaw
and
other
puzzles
dominoes
articles
for
dramatic
representation
playing
cards
toys
for
games
of
physical
skill
such
as
tops
kites
skipping
ropes
etc
such
prepared
constructive
materials
as
meccano
and
a
great
mass
of
raw
material
for
construction
generally
termed
waste
there
should
be
a
series
of
boxes
or
shelves
where
such
waste
products
of
the
home
or
of
the
woods
or
of
the
seashore
or
of
the
shop
might
be
stored
in
some
classified
order
the
collective
instinct
is
stronger
than
the
more
civilised
habit
of
orderliness
here
is
an
opportunity
for
developing
a
habit
from
an
instinct
there
should
also
be
materials
for
expression
such
as
clay
paper
chalk
pencil
paints
weaving
materials
cardboard
and
scenery
materials
and
such
tools
as
scissors
cardboard
knives
needlework
tools
paste
brushes
and
others
that
may
be
necessary
and
suitable
the
rooms
should
be
large
and
suitable
for
much
moving
about
the
most
usual
conditions
should
be
a
scattered
class
and
not
a
seated
listening
class
this
means
light
chairs
and
tables
or
benches
where
handwork
can
be
done
low
cupboards
and
lockers
so
that
each
child
can
get
at
his
own
things
broad
for
plants
and
flowers
and
a
bookcase
for
reading
and
picture
books
here
again
good
are
as
essential
as
even
more
essential
than
readers
in
the
transition
class
they
will
be
a
little
more
advanced
than
in
the
nursery
school
and
will
be
of
the
type
of
the
pied
piper
illustrated
or
pictures
of
children
of
other
lands
and
times
some
of
rackham
of
harold
copping
of
the
publications
by
black
in
at
many
are
suitable
for
this
stage
readers
should
be
chosen
for
their
literary
value
from
the
recognised
classics
such
as
the
peter
rabbit
type
in
wonderland
and
not
made
up
for
the
sake
of
reading
practice
the
pictures
on
the
walls
should
be
hung
at
the
right
and
the
windows
low
enough
for
looking
at
the
outside
world
whatever
it
may
be
the
teacher
desk
should
be
in
a
corner
not
in
the
central
part
of
the
room
for
she
must
remember
that
the
children
are
still
in
the
main
seeking
experience
not
listening
to
the
experience
of
another
they
should
have
access
to
the
garden
and
playground
and
all
the
incitements
to
activity
should
be
there
similar
to
those
of
the
nursery
school
or
those
provided
by
the
london
county
council
in
parks
the
bare
wilderness
of
playground
now
so
familiar
where
there
is
neither
time
nor
opportunity
for
children
to
be
other
than
primitive
savages
does
not
represent
the
outside
world
of
beauty
and
of
adventure
the
lower
classes
of
junior
school
should
differ
very
little
in
their
miniature
world
life
is
still
activity
to
the
child
of
eight
and
consequently
should
contain
no
immovable
furniture
there
will
be
more
books
and
the
children
may
be
in
their
seats
for
longer
periods
the
atmosphere
of
guided
but
still
spontaneous
work
is
more
definite
but
the
aim
in
choice
of
both
furniture
and
apparatus
is
still
the
gaining
of
experience
of
life
by
direct
contact
in
the
main
such
is
the
requisition
sheet
to
be
presented
to
the
stores
superintendent
of
the
local
education
authority
in
the
future
with
an
explanatory
note
stating
that
in
a
general
way
what
is
actually
required
is
the
world
in
miniature
chapter
xviii
gaining
experience
by
play
the
second
principle
is
that
the
method
of
gaining
experience
lies
through
play
and
that
by
this
road
we
can
best
reach
work
play
is
marked
off
from
work
chiefly
by
the
absence
of
any
outside
pressure
and
pleasure
in
the
activity
is
the
characteristic
of
play
pure
and
simple
if
a
child
has
forced
upon
him
a
hint
of
any
ulterior
motive
that
may
be
in
the
mind
of
his
teacher
the
pleasure
is
spoilt
for
him
and
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
play
is
lost
in
bringing
children
into
school
during
their
play
period
probably
the
most
important
formative
period
of
their
lives
and
in
utilising
their
play
consciously
we
are
interfering
with
one
of
their
most
precious
possessions
when
they
are
still
too
helpless
to
resent
it
directly
too
many
of
us
make
play
a
means
of
concealing
the
wholesome
but
unwelcome
morsel
of
information
in
jam
and
we
try
to
force
it
on
the
children
prematurely
and
surreptitiously
but
nature
generally
defeats
us
the
only
sound
thing
to
do
is
to
the
for
all
it
is
worth
and
recognise
that
in
doing
so
education
will
look
after
itself
to
understand
the
nature
of
play
and
to
have
the
courage
to
follow
it
is
the
business
of
every
teacher
of
young
children
the
nursery
school
especially
if
it
consists
chiefly
of
children
under
five
presents
at
first
very
hard
problems
to
the
teacher
however
strong
her
belief
in
play
may
be
it
receives
severe
tests
so
much
of
the
play
at
first
seems
to
be
aimless
running
and
shouting
or
throwing
about
of
toys
and
breaking
them
if
possible
so
much
quarrelling
and
fighting
and
weeping
seem
involved
with
any
attempts
at
social
life
on
the
part
of
the
children
there
seems
very
little
desire
to
and
very
little
desire
to
construct
as
a
rule
a
child
roams
from
one
thing
to
another
with
apparently
only
a
fleeting
attempt
to
play
with
it
yet
on
the
other
hand
to
make
the
problem
more
baffling
a
child
will
spend
a
whole
morning
at
one
thing
quite
lately
one
child
announced
that
he
meant
to
play
with
water
all
day
and
he
did
another
never
left
the
and
apparently
repeated
the
same
kind
of
activity
during
a
complete
morning
visitors
said
in
a
rather
disappointed
tone
they
just
play
all
the
time
by
themselves
one
teacher
brought
out
an
attractive
picture
and
when
a
group
of
children
gathered
round
it
she
proceeded
to
tell
the
story
they
listened
politely
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
group
gradually
melted
away
they
were
not
ready
for
concentrated
effort
if
those
children
had
been
in
the
ordinary
baby
room
of
a
school
they
would
have
been
quite
docile
sitting
in
their
places
apparently
listening
to
the
story
amiably
using
their
bricks
or
other
materials
according
to
the
teacher
directions
but
they
would
not
in
the
real
sense
have
been
playing
this
is
an
example
of
the
need
for
both
principle
and
courage
it
is
into
this
chaotic
method
of
gaining
experience
that
the
teacher
comes
with
her
interpretive
power
she
sees
in
it
the
beginnings
of
all
the
big
things
of
life
and
like
a
bigger
child
she
joins
and
like
a
bigger
child
she
improves
she
sees
in
the
apparent
chaos
an
attempt
to
get
experience
of
the
different
aspects
of
life
in
the
apparently
aimless
activity
an
attempt
to
realise
and
develop
the
bodily
powers
in
the
fighting
and
quarrelling
an
attempt
to
establish
a
place
in
social
life
it
is
all
unconscious
on
the
part
of
a
child
but
a
necessary
phase
of
real
development
gradually
the
little
primitive
man
begins
to
yield
to
civilisation
he
is
interested
in
things
for
longer
and
asks
for
stories
music
and
rhymes
and
what
does
this
mean
as
he
develops
a
child
learns
much
about
life
in
his
care
of
the
garden
about
language
in
his
games
about
human
conduct
from
stories
but
he
does
these
things
because
he
wants
to
do
them
and
because
there
is
a
play
need
behind
it
all
which
for
him
is
a
life
need
in
order
to
build
a
straight
wall
he
must
classify
his
bricks
in
order
to
be
a
real
shopman
he
must
know
his
weights
in
order
to
be
a
good
workman
he
must
measure
his
paper
all
the
ideas
gained
from
these
things
come
to
him
with
sense
they
are
associated
with
the
needs
and
interests
of
daily
life
and
because
of
this
he
puts
into
the
activity
all
the
effort
of
which
he
is
capable
or
as
dewey
has
expressed
it
the
maximum
of
consciousness
into
the
experience
which
is
his
play
this
is
real
sense
training
differing
in
this
respect
from
the
training
given
by
the
montessori
material
which
has
no
appeal
to
life
interest
aims
at
exercising
the
senses
separately
and
discourages
with
the
apparatus
it
is
activity
without
a
body
practice
without
an
end
and
nothing
develops
from
it
of
a
constructive
or
expressive
nature
in
the
nursery
class
therefore
our
curriculum
is
life
our
apparatus
all
that
a
child
world
includes
and
our
method
the
one
of
joyful
investigation
by
means
of
which
ideas
and
skill
are
being
acquired
the
teacher
is
player
in
chief
ready
to
suggest
supply
information
lead
or
follow
as
circumstances
demand
responsibility
must
still
belong
to
the
children
for
while
most
of
them
know
quite
naturally
how
to
play
there
are
many
who
will
never
get
beyond
a
rather
narrow
limit
through
lack
of
experience
or
of
initiative
it
is
quite
safe
to
let
experience
take
its
chance
through
play
but
there
are
certain
things
that
must
be
dealt
with
quite
definitely
when
the
teacher
is
not
there
as
a
playmate
but
as
something
more
in
the
capacity
of
a
mother
it
is
impossible
to
train
all
the
habits
necessary
at
this
time
through
the
spontaneous
play
although
incidentally
many
will
be
greatly
helped
and
made
significant
by
it
if
the
children
come
from
poor
homes
where
speech
is
imperfect
probably
mere
imitation
of
the
teacher
which
is
the
chief
factor
in
ordinary
language
training
will
be
insufficient
it
will
be
necessary
to
invent
ways
chiefly
games
by
which
the
vocal
organs
may
be
used
this
may
be
considered
play
but
it
is
more
artificial
and
less
spontaneous
than
the
informal
activity
already
described
it
is
well
to
be
clear
as
to
the
kind
of
exercises
best
suited
to
make
the
vocal
organs
supple
and
then
to
make
these
the
basis
of
a
game
for
example
little
children
constantly
imitate
the
cries
of
ordinary
life
town
children
could
dramatise
a
railway
station
where
the
sounds
produced
by
engines
and
by
porters
give
a
valuable
training
they
could
imitate
street
cries
the
sound
of
the
wind
of
motor
hooters
sirens
or
of
church
bells
country
children
could
use
the
sounds
of
the
the
birds
or
the
wind
in
the
recognition
of
sound
which
is
as
necessary
as
its
production
such
a
guessing
game
could
be
taught
as
i
sent
my
son
to
be
a
grocer
and
the
first
thing
he
sold
began
with
and
ended
with
using
the
not
names
of
the
letters
for
the
acquisition
of
a
vocabulary
such
a
game
as
the
family
coach
might
be
played
and
turned
into
many
other
vehicles
or
objects
about
which
many
stories
could
be
told
all
the
time
the
game
must
be
played
with
the
same
fidelity
to
the
spirit
of
play
as
previously
but
the
introduction
must
be
recognised
as
more
artificial
and
forced
and
this
can
be
justified
because
so
many
children
are
not
normal
with
regard
to
speech
and
only
where
this
is
the
case
should
language
training
be
forced
upon
them
habits
of
courtesy
of
behaviour
at
table
of
position
of
dressing
and
undressing
of
washing
hands
and
brushing
teeth
and
many
others
must
all
be
but
taught
at
the
time
when
the
need
comes
occasions
will
certainly
occur
during
play
but
the
chances
of
repetition
are
not
sufficient
to
count
on
thus
we
summarise
the
chief
business
of
the
nursery
school
teacher
when
we
say
that
it
is
concerned
chiefly
with
habits
and
play
and
right
surroundings
play
in
the
transition
class
is
less
informal
after
the
age
of
six
certain
ambitions
grow
and
must
be
satisfied
the
aspects
of
life
are
more
separated
and
concentration
on
individual
ones
is
commoner
this
means
more
separation
into
subjects
and
thus
a
child
is
more
willing
to
be
organised
and
to
have
his
day
to
extent
arranged
for
him
while
in
the
nursery
class
only
what
was
absolutely
necessary
was
fixed
in
the
transition
class
it
is
convenient
to
fix
rather
more
for
the
sake
of
establishing
certain
regular
habits
and
because
it
is
necessary
to
give
the
freshest
hours
to
the
work
that
requires
most
concentration
we
must
remember
however
that
it
a
transition
class
and
not
set
up
a
completely
fashioned
for
the
whole
day
reading
and
arithmetic
must
be
acquired
both
as
knowledge
and
skill
the
mother
tongue
requires
definite
practice
there
must
be
a
time
for
physical
activity
and
living
things
must
not
be
attended
to
spasmodically
therefore
it
seems
best
that
these
things
be
taken
in
the
morning
hours
while
the
afternoon
is
still
a
time
for
free
choice
of
activity
the
following
is
a
plan
for
the
transition
class
showing
the
bridge
between
absolute
freedom
and
a
fully
organised
morning
afternoon
monday
from
games
and
or
other
and
tuesday
the
of
social
and
handwork
music
and
such
as
or
handwork
puzzles
games
of
thursday
looking
at
representation
preparations
friday
or
handwork
granting
this
arrangement
we
must
be
clear
how
play
as
a
method
can
still
hold
it
does
not
hold
in
the
informal
incidental
sense
of
the
nursery
school
there
are
periods
in
the
transition
class
when
the
children
know
that
they
are
working
for
a
definite
purpose
which
is
not
direct
play
as
in
reading
and
there
are
times
when
they
are
dissatisfied
with
their
performances
of
skill
and
ask
to
be
shown
a
better
way
and
voluntarily
practise
to
secure
the
end
as
in
handwork
arithmetic
and
some
kinds
of
physical
games
the
remainder
is
probably
still
pursued
for
its
own
sake
how
then
can
this
play
spirit
be
maintained
side
by
side
with
work
first
of
all
the
children
should
not
be
required
to
do
anything
without
having
behind
it
a
purpose
that
appeals
to
them
it
may
not
be
the
ultimate
purpose
of
their
good
but
a
secondary
reason
may
be
given
to
which
they
will
respond
readily
generally
the
pretence
reason
arithmetic
to
the
ordinary
person
is
a
thing
of
real
life
we
count
chiefly
in
connection
with
money
with
making
things
with
distributing
things
or
with
arranging
things
and
we
count
carefully
when
we
keep
scores
in
games
in
adult
life
we
seldom
or
never
count
or
perform
arithmetical
operations
for
sheer
pleasure
in
the
activity
but
there
are
many
children
who
do
so
in
the
same
spirit
as
we
play
patience
or
chess
and
all
this
is
our
basis
the
arithmetical
activities
in
the
transition
class
should
therefore
be
based
on
such
everyday
experiences
as
have
been
mentioned
else
there
will
be
no
associations
made
between
the
experiences
of
school
and
those
of
life
outside
the
two
must
merge
there
is
no
such
thing
as
arithmetic
pure
and
simple
for
children
unless
they
seek
it
they
must
play
at
real
life
and
the
real
life
that
they
are
now
capable
of
appreciating
skill
in
calculation
accuracy
and
quickness
can
be
acquired
by
a
kind
of
practice
that
children
are
quite
ready
for
if
it
comes
when
they
realise
the
need
most
children
feel
that
their
power
to
score
for
games
is
often
too
slow
and
inaccurate
as
store
clerks
they
are
uncertain
in
their
calculations
they
will
be
willing
to
practise
quick
additions
subtractions
multiplications
and
divisions
in
pure
arithmetical
form
if
the
pretence
purpose
is
clearly
in
view
which
to
them
is
a
real
purpose
the
same
thing
occurs
in
writing
which
should
be
considered
a
side
issue
of
reading
meaningless
words
or
sentences
are
written
wearily
and
without
pains
but
to
write
the
name
of
a
picture
you
have
painted
at
the
bottom
of
it
or
to
write
something
that
godmother
said
or
bit
by
bit
to
write
a
letter
will
be
having
a
purpose
that
gives
life
to
an
apparently
meaningless
act
and
thoroughness
to
the
effort
in
handwork
too
at
this
stage
practice
takes
an
important
place
a
child
is
willing
to
hem
to
try
certain
brush
strokes
to
cut
evenly
and
later
on
to
use
his
cardboard
knife
to
effect
for
the
sake
of
a
future
result
if
he
has
already
experimented
freely
this
is
in
full
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
play
when
we
think
of
the
practiced
strokes
and
throws
of
the
later
games
but
it
is
a
more
advanced
quality
of
play
because
there
is
the
beginning
of
a
purpose
which
is
separated
from
immediate
pleasure
in
the
activity
there
is
the
hint
of
an
end
in
view
though
it
is
a
child
end
and
not
the
adult
or
economic
one
the
training
of
the
mother
tongue
can
be
made
very
effective
by
means
of
games
in
the
days
when
children
parties
were
simple
and
family
life
was
united
language
games
in
the
long
dark
evenings
gave
to
many
a
grip
of
words
and
expressions
children
learnt
to
describe
accurately
to
be
very
fastidious

choice
of
words

no

compete
in

with
these

because
behind
them
was

compelled

physical
development

owes
its

to

of

drill
pure
and

has
its
place
partly
in
the
same
sense
as
practice
in
number
or
handwork
and
partly
as
a
corrective
to
our
fallacious
system
of
education
by
listening
instead
of
by
activity
and
we
can
not
in
a
lifetime
acquire
the
powers
of
the
race
except
by
concentrated
practice
but
no
amount
of
drill
can
give
the
experience
necessary
for
physical
readiness

physical
and
mental

that
the

of

can
give
it
is
through
the
games
that
british
children
inherit
and
by
means
of
which
they
have
unconsciously
rehearsed
many
of
the
situations
of
life
that
they
have
been
able
to
take
their
place
readily

balance
to

drill
is
more
specialised
and
has
specialisation
for
its
end
a
game
calls
on
the
whole
of
an
individual
he
must
be
alert
mentally
and
physically
and
at
the
same
time
the
sense
of
fairness
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
on
no
game
can
be
tolerated
as
part
of
education
where
there
is
looseness
in
this
direction
from
the
skittles
of
the
nursery
class
to
the
cricket
and
hockey
of
the
seventh
standard
and
nothing
will
so
entirely
outrage
the
feelings
as
a

careless

in

too
the

side
is
strongly
developed
leadership
and
are
more
valuable
lessons
of
experience
than
fluent
reading
or
neat
writing
or
accurate
additions
but
they
have
not
counted
as
such
in
our
economic
system
of
education
they
have
taken
their
chance
few
inspectors
ask
to
see
whether
children
know
how
to
play
the
game
and
yet
they
are
so
soon
to
play
the
independent
game
of
life
but
the
individual
output
of
reading
and
sums
of
a
sneaking
and
cowardly
or
assertive
and
selfish
child
is
as
good
probably
as
that
of
a
child
that
has
the
makings
of
a
hero
in
him
and
then
we
wonder
at
the
propensities
of
the
lower
classes
it
is
because
we
have
never
made
sure
that
they
can
play
the
game
to
summarise
play
in
the
nursery
school
stage
is
unorganised
informal
and
pursued
with
no
motive
but
pleasure
in
the
activity
itself
it
is
mainly
individual
play
in
the
transition
class
is
more
definitely
in
the
form
of
games
organised
play
efforts
of
skill
mental
or

play
in
the
junior
school
is
almost
an
occasional
method

is

this

chapter
xix
the
unity
of
experience
we
find
in
the
child
spontaneous
choice
the
nature
of
the
surroundings
and
of
the
activities
he
craves
for
in
other
words
he
makes
his
own
curriculum
and
selects
his
own
subject
matter
the
next
problem
we
have
to
solve
is
how
to
unify
the
bewildering
variety
of
ideas
and
activities
that
a
child
seeks
contact
with
during
a
day
we
found
that
the
curriculum
of
the
infant
school
of
presented
a
rather
confusing
variety
of
ideas
not
necessarily
arranged
as
the
children
would
have
chosen
they
would
certainly
not
have
chosen
to
break
off
some
intense
interest
because
an
arbitrary
timetable
hurried
them
to
something
else
and
they
would
have
been
right
if
we
asked
the
children
their
reasons
for
choosing
we
would
find
no
clue
except
that
they
chose
what
they
wanted
to
neither
could
they
tell
us
why
they
spent
so
much
more
time
over
one
thing
than
another
if
a
similar
study
were
to
be
made
of
a
child
from
a
slum
also
free
to
arrange
his
day
we
should
find
that
while
certain
general
features
were
the
same
others
would
be
different
he
would
ask
for
different
stories
probably
play
different
games
or
the
same
games
in
a
different
way
his
would
present
different
aspects
the
things
he
made
would
be
different
it
is
evident
that
the
old
correlation
method
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
a
child
may
or
may
not
draw
the
rabbit
he
feeds
he
certainly
does
not
play
a
rabbit
game
because
of
the
rabbit
he
has
fed
nor
does
he
build
a
with
his
bricks
he
might
try
to
make
a
real
one
if
the
rabbit
really
needed
it
but
that
arises
out
of
an
obvious
necessity
if
he
could
put
his
unconscious
promptings
into
words
he
would
say
he
did
the
things
because
he
wanted
to
because
somebody
else
did
them
or
because
of
something
he
saw
yesterday
and
so
on
but
he
would
always
refer
back
to
the
central
link
in
each
case
is
in
the
child
with
his
special
store
of
experiences
derived
from
his
own
particular
surroundings
he
brings
to
new
experiences
his
store
of
present
experiences
his
interests
not
always
satisfied
his
powers
variously
used
he
interprets
the
new
by
these
and
seeks
for
more
in
the
line
of
the
old
it
is
life
he
has
experienced
and
he
seeks
for
more
life
how
then
can
we
secure
for
him
that
the
new
experiences
presented
to
him
in
school
will
be
in
line
with
the
old
we
will
take
three
typical
cases
of
children
to
illustrate
the
real
nature
of
this
problem
the
first
is
the
case
of
a
child
living
in
a
very
poor
district
of
london
or
of
any
large
town
the
school
is
presumably
situated
in
a
narrow
street
running
off
the
high
street
of
the
district
the
street
where
all
the
shopping
is
done
at
the
corner
is
a
hide
factory
with
an
evil
smell
most
of
the
abut
on
the
pavement
some
with
a
very
small
yard
behind
some
without
any
several
families
live
in
one
house
and
often
one
room
is
all
a
family
can
afford
as
that
has
to
be
paid
for
in
advance
the
family
address
may
change
frequently
the
father
may
be
a
dock
labourer
with
uncertain
pay
a
coster
a
rag
and
bone
merchant
or
he
may
follow
some
unskilled
occupation
of
a
similarly
precarious
nature
in
consequence
the
mother
has
frequently
to
do
daily
work
the
home
is
locked
up
till
evening
and
she
often
leaves
before
the
children
start
for
morning
school
it
is
a
curious
but
very
common
fact
that
free
though
these
children
are
they
know
only
a
very
small
radius
around
their
own
homes
they
are
accustomed
to
be
sent
shopping
into
high
street
where
household
stores
are
bought
in
pennyworths
or
twopennyworths
owing
to
uncertain
finance
and
no
storage
accommodation
generally
there
is
one
tap
and
one
sink
in
the
basement
for
the
needs
of
all
the
families
in
the
house
there
is
usually
a
park
somewhere
within
reach
but
it
may
be
a
mile
away
in
it
would
at
least
be
trees
a
pond
grass
flowers
but
an
excursion
there
unless
it
is
undertaken
by
the
school
can
only
be
hoped
for
on
a
fine
bank
holiday
there
is
neither
time
nor
money
to
go
on
a
saturday
and
sunday
can
not
be
said
to
begin
till
about
when
the
close
and
the
father
comes
home
to
dinner
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
conversation
of
such
a
household
family
life
exists
only
on
sunday
at
the
child
background
of
family
life
is
a
room
which
is
at
once
a
bedroom
living
room
and
laundry
there
is
nearly
always
some
part
of
a
meal
on
the
table
and
some
washing
hanging
up
outside
there
are
the
dingy
street
the
crowded
shops
the
pavement
to
play
on
and
both
outside
and
in
the
bleaker
and
more
sordid
aspects
of
life
sometimes
miserable
sometimes
exciting
on
saturday
night
the
lights
are
brilliant
and
life
is
at
least
intense
bed
is
a
very
crowded
affair
in
which
many
children
sleep
covered
with
the
remainder
of
the
day
wardrobe
what
store
of
experiences
does
a
child
from
such
a
neighbourhood
bring
to
school
to
be
assimilated
with
the
new
experiences
provided
there
what
do
such
terms
as

him
they
mean
footnote
see
october
not
a
mile
away
we
may
come
to
a
very
respectable
suburb
of
the
average
type
and
what
is
said
of
it
may
apply
in
some
degree
to
a
provincial
or
country
town
or
at
least
the
application
can
easily
be
made
the
school
probably
stands
at
the
top
corner
of
a
road
of
houses
rented
at
to
per
annum
with
gardens
in
front
and
behind
the
road
generally
runs
into
a
main
road
with
shops
and
traffic
here
and
there
in
the
residential
road
are
little
oases
of
shops
patronised
by
the
neighbourhood
and
some
of
the
children
may
live
over
these
the
home
life
is
more
ordinary
and
needs
less
descriptive
detail
but
there
are
some
features
that
must
be
considered
the
decencies
not
to
say
refinements
of
eating
sleeping
and
washing
are
taken
for
granted
there
is
often
a
and
always
a
kitchen
the
father
occupation
may
be
local
but
a
good
many
fathers
will
go
to
town
there
is
generally
a
family
holiday
to
the
sea
or
less
often
to
the
country
in
the
house
the
degree
of
refinement
varies
there
are
nearly
always
pictures
of
a
sort
books
of
a
sort
and
the
children
are
supplied
with
toys
of
a
sort
they
visit
each
other
houses
and
the
observances
of
social
life
are
kept
variously
often
the
horizon
is
very
narrow
the
interest
is
very
local
and
timid
the
father
business
life
may
be
absolutely
apart
from
his
home
life
and
never
mentioned
there
the
family
conversation
while
quite
amiable
and
agreeable
may
be
round
very
few
topics
and
the
vocabulary
while
quite
respectable
may
be
most
limited
children
questions
may
be
put
aside
as
either
trivial
or
unsuitable
in
one
sense
the
slum
child
may
be
said
to
have
a
broader
background
the
realities
of
life
are
bare
to
him
on
their
most
sordid
side
there
is
neither
mystery
nor
beauty
around
life
or
death
or
the
natural
affections
the
suburban
child
may
on
the
contrary
be
balked
and
restricted
so
that
unnecessary
mystery
gives
an
unwholesome
interest
to
these
things
and
conventionality
a
dishonest
reserve
a
suburb
of
this
type
is
described
by
beresford
in
in
such
districts
as
gospel
oak
i
am
depressed
by
the
flatness
of
an
awful
monotony
the
slums
vex
me
far
less
there
i
find
adventure
and
jest
whatever
the
squalor
the
marks
of
the
primitive
struggle
through
dirt
and
darkness
towards
release
those
horrible
lines
of
moody
complacent
streets
represent
not
struggle
but
the
achievement
of
a
worthless
aspiration
the
houses
with
their
deadly
similarity
their
smug
false
exteriors
their
conformity
to
an
ideal
which
is
typified
by
their
poor
imitative
decoration
could
only
be
inhabited
by
people
who
have
no
thought
or
desire
for
expression
the
dwellers
in
such
districts
are
cramped
into
the
vice
of
their
environment
their
homes
represent
the
dull
concession
to
a
state
rule
and
their
lives
take
tone
from
the
grey
repetition
of
one
endlessly
repeated
design
the
same
foolish
ornamentation
on
every
house
reiterates
the
same
suggestion
their
places
of
worship
the
blank
chapels
and
churches
rear
themselves
head
and
shoulders
above
the
dull
level
only
to
repeat
the
same
threat
of
obedience
to
a
gloomy
law
the
thought
of
gospel
oak
and
its
like
is
the
thought
of
imitation
of
imitation
falling
back
and
becoming
stereotyped
until
the
meaning
of
the
thing
so
persistently
copied
has
been
lost
and
forgotten
a
third
case
is
that
of
the
country
child
the
child
who
attends
the
village
school
many
villages
lie
several
miles
from
a
railway
station
so
that
the
younger
children
may
not
see
a
railway
train
more
than
once
or
twice
a
year
the
fathers
may
be
engaged
in
village
trades
such
as
a
shoemaker
carpenter
gardener
general
shop
merchant
farm
labourer
or
farmer
the
village
houses
are
often
cramped
and
small
but
there
is
wholesome
space
outside
and
generally
a
good
garden
which
supplies
some
of
the
family
food
milk
and
eggs
are
easily
obtainable
and
conditions
of
living
are
seldom
as
crowded
as
in
a
town
the
country
children
see
more
of
life
in
complete
miniature
than
the
slum
or
the
suburban
child
can
do
for
the
whole
life
of
the
village
lies
before
him
the
school
is
generally
in
the
centre
with
a
good
playground
and
of
late
years
a
good
school
garden
is
frequent
the
village
church
generally
old
is
another
centre
of
life
and
there
is
at
least
the
vicarage
to
give
a
type
of
life
under
different
social
conditions
the
home
intellectual
background
may
vary
but
on
the
whole
can
not
be
reckoned
on
very
much
though
in
some
ways
it
is
more
narrow
than
the
suburban
one
it
is
often
less
superficial
in
a
different
way
from
the
slum
child
but
none
the
less
definitely
the
country
child
comes
face
to
face
with
the
realities
of
life
in
a
more
natural
and
desirable
way
than
either
of
the
others
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
some
of
the
effects
of
living
in
the
midst
of
real
nature
on
children
unconsciously
they
acquire
much
deep
knowledge
impossible
to
learn
through
nature
study
however
good
a
kind
of
knowledge
that
is
part
of
their
being
but
how
far
it
affects
them
emotionally
or
enters
into
their
scheme
of
life
is
hard
to
say
as
they
grow
up
much
of
it
is
merely
economic
acquirement
if
they
are
to
work
on
the
land
or
rear
cattle
or
drive
a
van
through
the
country
it
is
all
to
the
good
but
one
thing
is
noticeable
that
they
take
very
quickly
to
such
allurements
of
town
life
as
a
cinema
or
a
picture
paper
or
gramophone
and
this
points
to
unsatisfied
cravings
of
some
sort
not
necessarily
so
unworthy
or
superficial
as
the
means
sought
to
satisfy
them
from
these
rather
extreme
cases
we
get
near
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
is
quite
evident
that
each
of
these
children
brings
to
school
very
different
contributions
of
experience
on
which
to
build
though
their
general
needs
and
interests
are
similar
therefore
the
curriculum
of
the
school
will
depend
on
the
general
surroundings
and
circumstances
of
the
children
and
all
programmes
of
work
and
many
questions
of
organisation
will
be
built
on
this
the
model
programme
so
dear
to
some
teachers
must
be
banished
as
a
doctor
would
banish
a
general
prescription
no
honest
teacher
can
allow
this
part
of
her
work
to
be
done
for
her
by
any
one
else
therefore
the
central
point
is
the
child
previous
experience
and
on
this
the
experience
provided
by
school
curriculum
and
subject
matter
depends
one
or
two
examples
of
the
working
out
of
this
might
make
the
application
clearer
probably
the
realities
of
life
in
relation
to
money
differ
greatly
the
kind
of
problem
presented
to
the
poor
town
child
will
deal
with
shopping
in
pennyworths
or
ounces
with
getting
coals
in
pound
bagfuls
clothes
are
generally
and
so
ordinary
standard
prices
are
out
of
the
question
bread
is
bought
stale
and
therefore
cheaper
early
in
the
morning
preserved
milk
only
is
bought
and
that
in
halfpenny
quantities
only
problems
based
on
these
will
be
real
to
this
child
at
first
the
suburban
child
economic
experience
may
be
based
on
his
money
in
the
bank
and
the
normal
shopping
of
ordinary
life
the
country
child
is
frequently
very
ignorant
of
money
values
probably
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
the
country
general
shop
as
the
basis
he
could
also
begin
to
estimate
the
produce
of
the
school
garden
the
nursery
school
programme
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
nature
of
play
at
this
stage
that
a
is
out
of
the
question
and
in
fact
an
outrage
against
nature
only
for
social
convenience
and
for
the
establishment
of
certain
physical
habits
can
there
be
fixed
hours
there
must
be
approximate
limits
as
to
the
times
of
arrival
and
departure
but
nothing
of
the
nature
of
marking
registers
to
record
exact
minutes
little
children
sometimes
sleep
late
or
on
the
other
hand
the
mothers
may
have
to
leave
home
very
early
all
this
must
be
allowed
for
there
should
be
fixed
times
for
meals
and
for
sleep
and
these
should
be
rigidly
observed
and
there
should
be
regular
times
for
the
children
to
go
to
the
lavatories
all
these
establish
regularity
and
as
well
as
improving
general
health
but
anything
in
the
nature
of
story
periods
games
periods
handwork
periods
only
impedes
the
variously
developing
children
in
their
hunger
for
experiences
their
curriculum
is
life
as
the
teacher
has
spread
it
out
before
them
there
are
no
subjects
at
this
stage
the
various
aspects
ought
to
be
of
the
nature
of
a
glorious
feast
to
these
young
children
traherne
says
in
the
seventeenth
century
will
you
see
the
infancy
of
this
sublime
and
celestial
greatness
those
pure
and
virgin
apprehensions
i
had
in
my
infancy
and
that
divine
light
wherewith
i
was
born
are
the
best
unto
this
day
wherein
i
can
see
the
universe
verily
they
form
the
greatest
gift
his
wisdom
can
bestow
for
without
them
all
other
gifts
had
been
dead
and
vain
they
are
unattainable
by
books
and
therefore
will
i
teach
them
by
experience
certainly
adam
in
paradise
had
not
more
sweet
and
curious
apprehensions
of
the
world
than
i
when
i
was
a
child
all
appeared
new
and
strange
at
first
inexpressibly
rare
and
delightful
and
beautiful
i
was
a
little
stranger
which
at
my
entrance
into
the
world
was
saluted
and
surrounded
with
innumerable
joys
i
knew
by
intuition
those
things
which
since
my
apostasy
i
collected
again
by
the
highest
reason
all
things
were
spotless
and
pure
and
glorious
yea
and
infinitely
mine
and
joyful
and
precious
i
saw
in
all
the
peace
of
eden
is
it
not
that
an
infant
should
be
heir
of
the
whole
world
and
see
those
mysteries
which
the
books
of
the
learned
never
unfold
the
corn
was
orient
and
immortal
wheat
which
never
should
be
reaped
nor
was
ever
sown
i
thought
it
stood
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
the
dust
and
stones
of
the
street
were
as
precious
as
gold
the
gates
were
at
first
the
end
of
the
world
the
green
trees
when
i
saw
them
first
through
one
of
the
gates
transported
and
ravished
me
the
skies
were
mine
and
so
were
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
all
the
world
was
mine
and
i
the
only
spectator
and
enjoyer
of
it
so
that
with
much
ado
i
was
corrupted
and
made
to
learn
the
dirty
devices
of
this
world
which
i
now
unlearn
and
become
as
it
were
a
little
child
again
that
i
may
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
this
is
what
life
means
to
the
young
child
and
traherne
only
records
what
many
of
us
have
forgotten
there
is
little
need
for
interference
we
can
only
spread
the
feast
and
stand
aside
to
watch
for
opportunities
the
following
extract
is
given
from
a
teacher
it
shows
how
many
possibilities
open
out
to
a
teacher
and
how
impossible
it
is
to
keep
to
a
or
even
to
try
to
name
the
activities
the
children
concerned
were
about
five
years
old
newly
admitted
to
a
poor
school
in
london
the
records
are
selected
from
a
continuous
period
and
do
not
apply
to
one
day
plans
for
the
day
what
actually
happened
this
will
the
children
played
freely
be
entirely
free
and
the
children
chalking
most
of
the
time
those
will
choose
their
own
toys
and
threading
beads
were
most
put
them
away
interested
again
i
noticed
the
lack
of
idea
of
colour
i
found
one
new
boy
placing
his
sticks
according
to
colour
without
knowing
the
names
of
the
colours
the
boys
thought
the
soldiers
belonged
to
them
and
laughed
at
a
little
girl
for
choosing
them
i
have
i
realised
this
was
a
failure
discovered
that
they
love
to
for
i
asked
the
children
to
use
imitate
sounds
so
we
will
play
their
boards
and
chalks
for
a
at
this
they
could
draw
a
cat
definite
drawing
and
they
should
and
say
miauw
and
a
duck
and
have
had
the
time
to
use
them
say
quack
they
could
also
freely
and
discover
their
use
i
imitate
the
wind
got
very
little
information
about
their
vocabulary
i
found
that
many
children
i
shall
try
to
induce
the
pronounced
words
so
strangely
children
to
speak
to
me
about
their
that
i
could
only
with
difficulty
homes
in
order
to
discover
any
recognise
them
one
said
she
difficulties
of
pronunciation
and
had
a
bresser
with
clates
to
make
them
more
fluent
on
it
and
knies
others
spoke
of
manckle
firebrace
forts
one
child
speaking
of
curly
hair
called
it
killeyer
we
had
no
time
for
the
story
with
the
noah
arks
dolls
and
bricks
children
will
choose
their
own
toys
were
used
and
i
found
that
the
and
as
far
as
possible
i
will
put
girls
who
had
no
dolls
at
home
a
child
who
knows
how
to
use
them
were
delighted
to
be
able
to
dress
next
to
one
who
desires
to
sit
and
undress
them
and
put
them
still
to
bed
one
little
girl
walked
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
class
getting
her
doll
to
sleep
the
boys
were
making
a
noise
with
their
arks
and
she
remarked
on
this
so
we
induced
them
to
be
silent
while
the
dolls
were
put
to
sleep
the
boys
arranged
their
animals
in
long
lines
the
bricks
were
much
more
carefully
put
away
the
transition
and
the
junior
school
programme
even
after
the
nursery
school
period
much
of
the
curriculum
and
subject
matter
is
in
the
hands
of
the
children
themselves
though
the
relative
proportions
will
vary
according
to
the
children
experiences
it
is
pretty
evident
to
the
teacher
that
the
subjects
are
in
school
terms
nature
work
and
elementary
science
mathematics
constructive
and
expressive
work
literature
music
language
physical
exercise
and
religion
the
business
of
the
younger
child
is
with
real
things
and
activity
not
with
symbols
and
passivity
therefore
he
is
not
really
in
need
of
reading
writing
or
arithmetic
we
hear
arguments
from
ambitious
teachers
that
children
are
fond
of
reading
lessons
because
they
enjoy
the
fantasies
in
which
these
lessons
are
wrapped
or
the
efforts
made
by
the
teacher
to
create
interest
we
hear
that
children
ask
to
be
taught
to
read
they
also
ask
to
be
taught
to
drive
a
tram
or
to
cook
a
dinner
but
it
is
all
part
of
the
pretence
game
of
playing
at
being
grown
up
they
do
not
need
to
read
while
stories
and
poetry
can
be
told
or
read
to
them
they
are
not
ready
to
make
the
effort
of
working
for
a
remote
economic
end
where
there
is
no
real
pleasure
in
the
activity
and
no
opportunity
of
putting
their
powers
to
use
no
child
under
six
wants
to
sit
down
and
read
and
it
would
be
very
harmful
if
he
did
his
business
is
with
real
things
and
with
his
vocabulary
which
is
not
nearly
ready
to
put
into
symbols
yet
if
reading
is
delayed
hours
of
weary
drudgery
will
be
saved
and
energy
stored
for
more
precious
attainments
therefore
in
the
transition
class
children
over
six
at
lowest
the
only
addition
to
the
curriculum
already
set
out
for
the
nursery
class
would
be
arithmetic
and
reading
including
writing
the
other
differences
would
be
in
degree
only
in
the
junior
class
with
children
over
seven
at
lowest
a
desire
to
know
something
of
the
doings
of
people
in
other
countries
to
hear
about
other
parts
of
our
own
land
will
lead
to
the
beginnings
of
geography
while
with
this
less
imaginative
and
more
literal
period
comes
the
request
for
stories
that
are
more
verbally
true
and
questions
about
origins
leading
to
the
beginnings
of
history
it
is
very
much
easier
to
give
the
general
curriculum
than
to
deal
with
the
choice
of
actual
material
because
that
is
involved
largely
with
the
principle
of
the
unity
of
experience
and
as
we
know
experiences
vary
the
normal
town
and
country
child
and
the
abnormal
child
of
poverty
have
all
certain
human
cravings
in
common
and
these
are
provided
for
in
the
aspects
of
life
or
subjects
that
have
been
named
but
this
is
far
too
general
an
application
to
be
the
end
of
the
matter
each
subject
has
many
sides
to
offer
there
may
be
for
example
the
pottery
town
the
weaving
town
the
country
town
the
fishing
town
the
colliery
town
in
the
country
there
is
the
district
of
the
dairy
farmer
of
the
sheep
farmer
of
the
grain
grower
and
miller
of
the
fruit
farmer
of
the
hop
grower
and
many
districts
may
partake
of
more
than
one
characteristic
perhaps
the
most
curious
anomaly
of
experience
is
that
of
the
child
of
the
london
slums
who
goes
hopping
into
some
of
the
loveliest
parts
of
kent
in
early
autumn
and
so
in
a
general
way
at
least
the
concentrated
experience
of
school
must
fill
gaps
and
supply
experiences
that
life
has
not
provided
for
one
of
the
pottery
towns
in
staffordshire
is
built
on
very
unfertile
clay
there
are
several
potteries
in
the
town
belching
out
smoke
and
in
addition
rows
of
monotonous
houses
almost
always
a
yellow
pall
of
smoke
hangs
over
the
whole
district
and
even
where
the
edge
of
the
country
might
begin
the
grass
and
trees
are
poor
and
blackened
and
distant
views
are
seen
through
a
haze
there
are
almost
no
gardens
in
the
town
and
very
little
attempt
has
been
made
to
beautify
it
because
the
results
are
so
disappointing
beauty
therefore
in
various
forms
must
be
a
large
part
of
the
curriculum
already
design
is
a
common
interest
in
the
pottery
museums
of
the
district
and
this
could
be
made
a
motive
for
the
older
children
but
in
the
junior
and
nursery
school
pictures
of
natural
beauty
wild
flowers
if
it
is
possible
to
get
them
music
painting
and
drawing
and
literature
should
bulk
largely
enough
to
make
a
permanent
impression
on
the
children
in
a
very
remote
country
village
where
life
seems
to
go
slowly
and
days
are
long
children
should
be
encouraged
by
means
of
the
school
influence
to
make
things
that
absorb
thought
and
interest
to
tell
and
hear
stories
storytelling
in
the
evening
round
the
fire
is
a
habit
of
the
past
and
might
well
supply
some
of
the
cravings
that
have
to
be
satisfied
by
the
pictures
most
of
us
have
to
keep
ourselves
well
in
hand
when
we
listen
to
a
recitation
in
much
the
same
way
as
when
a
slate
pencil
used
to
creak
it
would
be
very
much
better
if
the
art
of
storytelling
were
cultivated
at
school
encouraged
at
home
and
applied
to
entertainments
indeed
the
entertainments
of
a
village
school
instead
of
being
the
unnatural
and
feverish
production
of
hours
of
overtime
might
well
be
the
ordinary
outcome
of
work
both
at
school
and
at
home
and
thus
a
motive
for
leisure
is
naturally
supplied
and
probably
a
hobby
initiated
it
is
profitable
sometimes
to
group
the
subjects
of
experience
in
order
to
preserve
balance
all
getting
of
experience
is
active
but
some
kinds
more
obviously
than
others
undoubtedly
in
hearing
stories
and
poetry
in
watching
a
snail
or
a
bee
in
listening
to
music
the
activity
is
mental
rather
than
physical
and
assimilation
of
ideas
is
more
direct
in
discovering
experiences
by
means
of
construction
expression
experiment
or
imitation
assimilation
is
less
direct
but
often
more
permanent
and
secure
froebel
discriminates
between
impression
and
expression
or
taking
in
and
giving
out
and
although
he
constantly
emphasised
that
the
child
takes
in
by
giving
it
is
convenient
to
recognise
this
distinction
another
helpful
grouping
is
the
more
objective
one
some
subjects
refer
more
particularly
to
human
conduct
the
enlargement
of
experiences
of
human
beings
and
the
building
up
of
the
ideal
these
are
literature
music
history
and
geography
others
refer
to
life
other
than
that
of
human
beings
commonly
known
as
nature
study
and
science
others
to
the
properties
of
inanimate
things
and
to
questions
throughout
all
life
of
measurement
size
and
force
this
is
known
as
mathematics
others
of
the
life
behind
the
material
and
the
spiritual
world
this
is
known
as
religion
chapter
xx
gaining
experience
through
freedom
the
atmosphere
of
freedom
is
the
only
atmosphere
in
which
a
child
can
gain
experiences
that
will
help
to
develop
character
the
principle
of
freedom
underlies
all
the
activities
of
the
school
and
does
not
refer
to
conduct
simply
intellectual
and
emotional
aspects
of
discipline
are
too
often
ignored
and
we
have
as
a
product
the
commonplace
narrow
imitative
person
too
timid
or
too
indolent
to
think
a
new
thought
or
to
feel
strongly
enough
to
stand
for
a
cause
is
the
goal
of
discipline
but
independent
thinking
enthusiasm
and
initiative
are
all
included
in
the
term
it
will
be
well
to
discriminate
between
the
occasions
both
in
the
nursery
school
and
in
the
transition
and
junior
classes
when
a
child
should
be
free
to
learn
by
experience
and
when
he
should
be
controlled
from
without
we
shall
probably
find
occasions
which
partake
of
the
nature
of
each
the
nursery
school
is
a
collection
of
individuals
presumably
from
to
years
of
age
they
know
no
social
life
beyond
the
family
life
and
family
experience
is
relative
to
the
size
of
the
family
in
any
case
they
have
not
yet
measured
themselves
against
their
peers
with
the
exception
of
the
occasional
twin
a
few
months
ago
about
twenty
children
of
this
description
formed
the
nucleus
of
a
new
nursery
school
where
as
far
as
possible
the
world
in
miniature
was
spread
out
before
them
and
they
were
guided
in
their
entrance
to
it
by
an
experienced
teacher
and
a
young
helper
for
the
first
few
weeks
the
chief
characteristic
was
noise
the
children
rushed
up
and
down
the
large
room
shouting
and
pushing
any
portable
toys
they
could
find
one
little
boy
of
employed
himself
in
what
can
only
be
called
punching
the
other
children
snatching
their
possessions
away
from
them
and
responding
to
the
teacher
by
the
law
of
he
was
the
most
intelligent
child
in
the
school
he
generally
left
a
line
of
weeping
children
behind
him
and
several
began
to
imitate
him
the
pugnacious
instinct
requires
little
encouragement
lunch
was
a
period
of
snatching
spilling
and
making
plans
to
get
the
best
many
of
the
toys
provided
were
carelessly
trampled
upon
and
broken
requests
to
put
away
things
at
the
end
of
the
day
were
almost
unavailing
when
the
time
for
sleeping
came
in
the
afternoon
many
of
the
children
refused
to
lie
down
some
consented
but
only
to
sing
and
talk
as
they
lay
only
one
a
child
of
slept
because
he
cried
himself
to
sleep
from
sheer
strangeness
this
apparently
unbeautiful
picture
is
only
the
first
battle
of
the
individual
on
his
entrance
to
the
life
of
the
community
on
the
other
hand
there
were
intervals
of
keen
joy
water
sand
and
clay
chiefly
absorbed
the
younger
children
the
older
ones
wanted
to
wash
up
and
scrub
and
many
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
looking
at
this
was
the
raw
material
for
the
teacher
to
begin
with
the
children
came
from
comfortable
suburban
homes
none
were
really
poor
and
many
had
known
no
privation
they
were
keen
for
experiences
and
disposed
to
be
very
friendly
to
her
after
five
months
there
is
a
marked
difference
in
spirit
the
noise
is
modified
because
the
children
found
other
absorbing
interests
though
at
times
nature
still
demands
voice
production
during
lunch
time
and
sleeping
time
there
is
quiet
but
the
teacher
has
never
for
silence
unless
there
was
some
such
evident
reason
there
is
no
silence
game
the
difference
has
come
from
within
the
children
all
now
lie
down
in
the
afternoon
quietly
and
the
greater
number
sleep
but
there
has
been
no
command
or
any
kind
of
general
plan
again
the
desire
has
gradually
come
to
individuals
from
suggestion
and
imitation
lunch
is
quite
orderly
but
not
yet
without
an
occasional
accident
or
struggle
there
is
much
less
fighting
but
primitive
man
is
still
there
the
most
marked
development
is
in
the
growth
of
the
idea
of
taking
turns
the
children
have
begun
to
master
this
lesson
of
life
the
strong
pugnacious
habit
in
the
little
punching
boy
reached
a
point
that
showed
he
was
unable
to
conquer
it
from
within
about
two
months
after
his
arrival
the
teacher
consulted
his
mother
who
confirmed
all
that
the
teacher
had
experienced
her
prescription
was
smacking
after
a
good
deal
of
thought
and
many
ineffectual
talks
and
experiments
with
the
boy
the
teacher
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mother
was
right
she
took
him
to
the
cloakroom
after
the
next
outbreak
and
smacked
his
hands
he
was
surprised
and
a
little
hurt
but
very
soon
forgot
and
continued
his
practices
on
the
next
occasion
the
teacher
repeated
the
punishment
and
it
was
never
again
necessary
for
a
few
days
he
was
at
a
loss
for
an
occupation
because
punching
had
become
a
confirmed
habit
but
soon
other
interests
appealed
to
him
he
has
never
changed
in
his
trust
in
his
teacher
of
whom
he
is
noticeably
very
fond
and
he
has
now
realised
that
he
must
control
a
bad
habit
this
example
has
been
given
at
length
to
illustrate
the
relation
of
government
to
freedom
if
these
children
had
been
in
the
ordinary
baby
room
subject
to
a
to
constant
plans
by
the
teacher
for
their
activities
few
or
none
of
these
occasions
would
have
occurred
the
incipient
naughtiness
would
have
been
displayed
only
outside
in
the
playground
or
at
home
there
would
have
been
little
chance
of
chaos
of
fighting
of
punching
of
trying
to
get
the
best
thing
and
foremost
place
there
would
have
been
little
opportunity
for
choice
and
less
real
absorption
because
of
the
the
children
would
have
been
happy
enough
but
they
would
not
have
been
trained
to
live
as
individuals
outward
docility
is
a
fatal
trait
and
very
common
in
young
children
probably
it
is
a
form
of
but
the
real
child
only
lies
in
wait
to
make
opportunities
out
of
school
the
school
is
therefore
not
preparing
him
for
life
freedom
in
the
transition
and
the
junior
school
must
be
differently
applied
individual
life
begins
to
merge
into
community
life
and
the
children
begin
to
learn
that
things
right
for
individuals
may
be
wrong
for
the
community
but
the
problem
of
freedom
is
not
as
easy
as
the
problem
of
authority
standards
must
be
greatly
altered
and
outward
docility
no
longer
mistaken
for
training
in
individual
training
can
not
suddenly
become
class
discipline
neither
can
children
be
switched
from
the
nursery
school
to
a
class
system
the
idea
of
class
teaching
must
be
postponed
for
out
of
it
come
most
of
the
difficulties
of
discipline
and
it
is
not
the
natural
arrangement
at
this
transitional
period
a
teacher
is
imposing
on
a
number
of
very
different
individuals
a
system
that
says
their
difficulties
are
alike
that
they
must
all
work
at
one
rate
and
in
one
way
and
so
we
have
the
weary
reading
round
class
when
the
slow
ones
struggle
and
the
quick
ones
find
other
and
unlawful
occupation
we
have
the
number
lessons
broken
by
the
teacher
breathless
attempts
to
see
that
all
the
class
follows
we
have
the
handwork
that
imposes
an
average
standard
of
work
that
fits
nobody
exactly
intellectual
freedom
can
only
come
by
individual
or
group
work
while
class
teaching
is
only
for
such
occasions
as
a
literature
or
a
singing
lesson
or
the
presentation
of
an
occasional
new
idea
in
number
individual
and
group
work
need
much
organisation
but
while
classes
consist
of
over
forty
children
there
is
no
other
way
to
permit
intellectual
and
moral
freedom
of
course
the
furniture
of
the
room
will
greatly
help
to
make
this
more
possible
and
it
is
hoped
that
an
enlightened
authority
will
not
continue
to
supply
heavy
desks
for
the
junior
school
those
described
as
desks
for
listening
the
prevailing
atmosphere
should
be
a
busy
noise
and
not
silence
it
should
be
the
noise
of
children
working
oftener
than
of
the
teacher
teaching
teaching
the
whole
class
the
teacher
should
be
more
frequently
among
the
children
than
at
her
desk
and
the
voices
should
be
heard
more
often
than
hers
such
children
will
inevitably
become
intellectually
independent
and
morally
most
of
the
order
should
be
taken
in
hand
by
children
in
office
and
they
should
be
distinguished
by
a
badge
most
questions
of
punishment
should
be
referred
to
them
this
means
a
constant
appeal
to
the
law
that
is
behind
both
teacher
and
children
and
which
they
learn
to
reach
apart
from
the
teacher
control
where
shalt
of
the
law
becomes
will
of
the
doer
then
we
are
free

experiences
of
human
conduct
it
is
always
difficult
to
see
the
beginnings
of
things
we
know
that
stories
form
the
raw
material
of
morality
it
is
not
easy
to
trace
morality
in
black
sambo
the
three
bears
alice
in
wonderland
or
sleeping
beauty
but
nevertheless
morality
is
there
if
we
recognise
morality
in
everyday
things
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
everybody
should
have
an
ideal
even
a
burglar
his
ideal
is
to
be
a
good
and
thorough
burglar
and
probably
if
he
is
a
burglar
of
the
finer
sort
it
is
to
play
fair
to
the
whole
gang
it
is
better
to
be
a
burglar
with
an
ideal
than
a
blameless
person
with
very
little
soul
or
personality
who
just
slides
through
life
accepting
things
it
is
better
to
have
a
coster
ideal
of
a
holiday
than
to
be
too
indifferent
or
stupid
to
care
or
to
know
what
you
want
now
ideals
are
supposed
to
be
the
essence
of
morality
and
morality
comes
to
us
through
experience
and
only
experience
tests
its
truth
the
story
with
a
moral
is
generally
neither
literature
nor
morality
except
such
unique
examples
as
pilgrim
progress
the
kind
of
experience
with
which
morality
is
concerned
is
experience
of
human
life
in
various
circumstances
and
the
way
people
behave
under
those
circumstances
the
beginning
of
such
experience
is
our
own
behaviour
and
the
behaviour
of
other
people
we
know
but
this
is
too
limited
an
experience
to
produce
a
satisfactory
ideal
so
we
crave
for
something
wider
it
is
curious
how
strong
is
the
craving
for
this
kind
of
experience
in
all
normal
children
in
whom
one
would
suppose
sense
experiences
and
especially
muscular
experiences
to
be
enough
the
need
to
know
about
people
other
than
ourselves
and
yet
not
too
unlike
in
circumstances
other
than
our
own
and
yet
not
too
strange
seems
to
be
a
necessary
part
of
our
education
and
we
interpret
it
in
the
light
of
our
own
personal
conduct
out
of
this
as
well
as
out
of
our
direct
experience
we
build
our
ideal
when
one
realises
how
an
ideal
may
colour
the
whole
outlook
of
a
person
one
begins
to
realise
what
literature
means
to
a
child
the
early
ideal
is
crude
it
may
be
jack
the
or
an
cinderella
or
the
this
may
grow
into
hiawatha
or
robinson
crusoe
for
boys
and
a
fairy
tale
princess
or
one
of
the
little
women
for
girls
in
every
hero
a
child
sees
himself
and
the
ideal
stimulates
all
that
hidden
life
which
is
probably
the
most
important
part
of
his
growth
as
indirect
experiences
grow
or
in
other
words
as
he
hears
or
reads
more
stories
his
ideal
widens
and
his
knowledge
of
the
problems
of
life
is
enlarged
this
is
the
raw
material
of
morality
for
out
of
his
answers
to
these
problems
he
builds
up
standards
of
conduct
and
of
judgement
he
projects
himself
into
his
own
ideal
and
he
projects
himself
into
the
experiences
of
other
people
he
lives
in
both
this
is
imagination
of
the
highest
kind
it
is
often
called
sympathy
but
the
term
is
too
limited
it
is
rather
imaginative
understanding
there
is
another
side
of
life
grasped
by
means
of
this
new
world
of
experience
and
that
is
the
spiritual
side
that
lies
between
conduct
and
ideals
children
have
always
accepted
the
supernatural
quite
readily
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
all
the
world
is
new
and
therefore
supernatural
to
them
magic
is
done
daily
in
children
eyes
and
there
is
no
line
between
what
is
understandable
and
what
is
not
until
adults
try
to
interpret
it
for
them
they
are
curious
about
birth
and
death
and
all
origins
thunder
is
terrifying
the
sea
is
enthralling
the
wind
is
mysterious
the
sky
is
immense
and
all
suggest
a
power
beyond
in
this
the
children
are
reproducing
the
race
experience
as
expressed
in
myths
when
power
was
embodied
in
a
god
or
goddess
therefore
the
fairy
world
or
the
giant
world
or
the
wood
full
of
dwarfs
and
witches
houses
is
as
real
to
them
and
as
acceptable
as
any
part
of
life
it
is
their
recognition
of
a
world
of
spirits
which
later
on
mingles
itself
with
the
spiritual
life
of
religion
that
life
is
behind
all
matter
is
the
main
truth
they
hold
and
while
it
is
difficult
here
to
disentangle
morality
from
religion
it
is
supremely
evident
that
a
very
great
and
significant
side
of
a
child
education
is
before
us
it
is
by
means
of
the
divine
gift
of
imagination
probably
the
most
spiritual
of
a
child
gifts
that
he
can
lay
hold
of
all
that
the
world
of
literature
has
to
offer
him
because
of
imagination
he
is
independent
of
poverty
monotony
and
the
indifference
of
other
people
he
has
a
world
of
his
own
in
which
nothing
is
impossible
edwin
pugh
says
of
a
child
of
the
slums
who
was
passionately
fond
of
reading
cheap
literature
it
was
by
means
of
this
penny
passport
to
heaven
that
she
escaped
from
the
hell
of
her
surroundings
it
was
in
the
maudlin
fancies
of
some
poor
besotted
literary
hack
maybe
that
she
found
surcease
from
the
pains
of
weariness
the
carks
and
cares
of
her
miserable
estate
a
teacher
realising
this
should
feel
an
almost
unspeakable
sense
of
responsibility
in
having
to
select
and
present
matter
but
the
problem
should
be
solved
on
the
one
hand
by
her
own
high
standard
of
story
material
and
on
the
other
by
her
knowledge
of
the
child
needs
according
to
his
experiences
of
life
the
interpretation
of
the
story
will
differ
for
example
it
was
found
that
the
children
of
a
low
slum
neighbourhood
translated
the
into
terms
of
a
street
fight
to
children
living
by
a
river
or
the
sea
the
would
mean
very
much
while
of
the
would
be
more
familiar
ground
for
country
children
fairy
stories
of
the
best
kind
have
a
universal
appeal
in
choosing
a
story
a
teacher
should
be
aware
of
the
imperishable
part
of
it
the
truth
around
which
it
grew
sometimes
the
truth
may
seem
a
very
commonplace
one
sometimes
a
curious
one
for
example
very
young
children
generally
prefer
stories
of
home
life
because
round
the
family
their
experience
gathers
the
subject
seems
homely
but
it
is
really
one
of
the
fundamental
things
of
life
and
the
teacher
should
realise
this
in
such
a
way
that
the
telling
or
reading
of
the
story
makes
the
kernel
its
central
point
to
some
children
the
ideal
home
life
comes
only
through
literature
daily
experiences
rather
contradict
it
humour
is
an
important
factor
in
morality
unless
a
person
is
capable
of
seeing
the
humor
of
a
situation
he
is
likely
to
be
wanting
in
a
sense
of
balance
the
humor
of
a
situation
is
often
caused
by
the
wrong
proportion
or
wrong
balance
of
things
for
example
the
humour
of
mad
lies
partly
at
least
in
the
absurd
gravity
with
which
the
animals
regarded
the
whole
situation
the
extreme
of
alice
and
the
exaggerated
imitation
of
human
beings
a
really
moral
person
must
have
balance
as
well
as
sympathy
else
he
sees
things
out
of
proportion
these
examples
make
evident
that
we
are
not
to
seek
for
anything
very
patently
in
the
stories
for
children
it
is
life
in
all
its
phases
that
gives
the
material
but
it
must
be
true
life
not
false
or
sentimental
or
trivial
life
this
will
rule
out
the
pretty
stories
for
children
written
by
trivial
people
in
papers
or
the
story
or
the
artificial
myth
of
the
how
did
type
or
the
childish
story
where
the
language
is
rather
that
of
the
imitating
children
than
that
of
real
children
of
late
years
with
the
discovery
of
children
children
literature
has
grown
and
there
is
a
good
deal
to
choose
from
past
and
present
writers
there
is
no
recognised
or
stereotyped
method
of
telling
a
story
to
children
it
is
something
much
deeper
than
merely
an
acquired
art
it
is
the
teacher
giving
something
of
her
personality
to
the
children
something
that
is
most
precious
one
of
the
finest
of
our
english
kindergarten
teachers
once
said
i
feel
almost
as
if
i
ought
to
prepare
my
soul
before
telling
a
story
to
young
children
and
this
is
the
sense
in
which
the
story
should
be
chosen
and
told
there
are
of
course
certain
external
qualifications
which
must
be
so
fully
acquired
as
to
be
used
unconsciously
such
as
a
good
vocabulary
power
over
one
voice
a
recognition
of
certain
literary
phases
in
a
story
such
as
the
working
up
to
the
dramatic
crisis
the
working
down
to
the
end
so
that
it
shall
not
fall
flat
and
the
dramatic
touches
that
give
life
these
are
certainly
most
necessary
and
should
be
studied
and
cultivated
but
a
teacher
should
not
be
hampered
in
her
telling
by
being
too
conscious
of
them
rather
she
should
feel
such
respect
and
even
reverence
for
this
side
of
a
child
education
that
the
framework
and
setting
can
only
be
of
the
best
always
remembering
at
the
same
time
what
is
framework
and
setting
and
what
is
essence
much
that
has
been
said
about
the
method
and
aim
of
stories
might
apply
to
those
taken
from
the
bible
but
they
need
certain
additional
considerations
here
religion
and
morality
come
very
closely
together
the
recognition
of
a
definite
personality
behind
all
circumstances
of
life
to
whom
our
conduct
matters
gives
a
soul
to
morality
the
old
testament
is
a
record
of
the
growth
of
a
nation
more
fully
conscious
of
god
than
is
the
record
of
any
other
nation
and
because
of
this
children
can
understand
god
in
human
life
when
they
read
such
stories
as
the
childhood
of
moses
and
of
samuel
children
resemble
the
young
jewish
nation
in
this
respect
they
accept
the
direct
intervention
of
god
in
the
life
of
every
day
their
primitive
sense
of
justice
which
is
an
eye
for
an
eye
will
make
them
welcome
joyfully
the
plagues
of
egypt
and
the
crossing
of
the
red
sea
it
would
be
premature
to
force
on
them
the
more
mature
idea
of
mercy
which
would
probably
lead
to
confusion
of
judgement
they
must
be
clear
about
the
balance
of
things
before
they
readjust
it
for
themselves
much
of
the
material
in
the
old
testament
is
hardly
suitable
for
very
young
children
but
the
most
should
be
made
of
what
there
is
the
lives
of
eastern
people
are
interesting
to
children
and
help
to
make
the
phraseology
of
the
psalms
and
even
of
the
narratives
clear
to
them
wonder
stories
such
as
the
creation
the
flood
the
burning
bush
elijah
experiences
appeal
to
them
on
another
side
the
side
that
is
eager
to
wonder
the
accounts
of
the
childhood
of
ishmael
isaac
joseph
moses
david
and
samuel
and
the
little
syrian
maid
come
very
close
to
them
such
stories
should
be
given
to
young
children
so
that
they
form
part
of
the
enchanted
memory
of
childhood
which
is
permanent
with
the
new
testament
the
problem
is
more
difficult
one
hesitates
to
bring
the
life
of
christ
before
children
until
they
are
ready
to
understand
even
in
some
degree
its
significance
the
subject
is
apt
to
be
dealt
with
either
too
familiarly
and
made
too
commonplace
and
everyday
a
matter
or
as
something
so
far
removed
from
human
affairs
as
to
be
mysterious
and
remote
to
a
child
to
mix
old
and
new
testament
indiscriminately
as
for
example
by
taking
them
on
alternate
days
is
unforgivable
and
no
teacher
who
has
studied
the
bible
seriously
could
do
so
if
she
cared
about
the
religious
training
of
her
children
and
understood
the
bible
if
the
children
can
realise
something
of
the
sense
in
which
christ
helped
human
beings
then
some
of
the
incidents
in
his
life
might
be
given
such
as
his
birth
his
work
of
healing
feeding
and
helping
the
poor
and
some
of
his
stories
such
as
the
lost
sheep
the
lost
son
the
sower
the
good
samaritan
it
is
difficult
to
speak
strongly
enough
of
the
mistreatment
of
scripture
under
the
name
of
religion
it
has
been
spoilt
more
than
any
other
subject
in
the
curriculum
chiefly
by
being
taken
too
often
and
too
slightly
by
teachers
who
may
be
in
themselves
deeply
religious
but
who
have
not
applied
intelligence
to
this
matter
the
religious
life
of
a
young
child
is
very
direct
there
is
only
a
little
in
the
religious
experiences
of
the
jews
that
can
help
him
and
much
that
can
puzzle
and
hinder
him
their
interpretation
of
god
as
revengeful
cruel
and
in
his
dealings
with
their
enemies
must
greatly
puzzle
him
when
he
hears
on
the
other
hand
that
god
is
the
father
of
all
the
nations
on
the
earth
what
is
suitable
should
be
taken
and
taken
well
but
there
is
no
virtue
in
the
bible
misunderstood
poetry
is
a
form
of
literature
which
appeals
to
children
they
are
not
made
to
learn
it
by
unconsciously
they
learn
it
very
quickly
and
easily
if
they
understand
in
a
general
way
the
meaning
and
if
they
like
the
sound
of
the
words
rhythm
is
an
early
inheritance
and
can
be
encouraged
by
poetry
music
and
movement
the
sound
of
words
appeals
strongly
to
young
children
and
rhyming
is
almost
a
game
the
kind
of
poetry
preferred
varies
a
good
deal
but
on
the
whole
narrative
or
nonsense
verses
seem
most
popular
few
children
are
ready
for
sentiment
or
reflection
even
about
themselves
and
this
is
why
some
of
most
charming
poems
about
children
are
not
appreciated
by
them
as
much
as
by
people
and
for
the
same
reason
only
a
few
nature
poems
are
really
liked
without
doubt
the
only
aim
in
giving
poetry
to
children
is
to
help
them
to
appreciate
it
and
the
only
method
to
secure
this
is
to
read
it
to
them
appreciatively
and
often
besides
such
anthologies
as
golden
staircase
lucas
of
verses
for
children
and
others
we
must
go
to
the
bible
for
poems
like
the
song
of
miriam
or
of
deborah
and
the
psalms
to
shakespeare
for
such
songs
as
where
the
bee
sucks
i
know
a
bank
ye
spotted
snakes
either
with
or
without
music
to
longfellow
for
descriptive
pieces
and
to
scott
and
tennyson
for
ballads
and
songs
and
to
many
other
simple
classic
sources
outside
the
ordinary
collections
in
both
prose
and
poetry
probably
the
ultimate
aim
is
appreciation
of
beauty
in
human
conduct
clutton
brock
says
the
value
of
art
is
the
value
of
the
aesthetic
activity
of
the
spirit
and
we
must
all
value
that
before
we
can
value
works
of
art
rightly
and
ultimately
we
must
value
this
glory
of
the
universe
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
beauty
when
we
apprehend
it
again
he
says
parents
nurses
and
teachers
ought
to
be
aware
that
the
child
when
he
forgets
himself
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
is
passing
through
a
sacred
experience
which
will
enrich
and
glorify
the
whole
of
his
life
if
all
this
is
what
literature
means
in
a
child
experiences
of
life
then
it
must
be
given
a
worthy
place
in
the
and
curriculum
and
in
the
serious
preparation
by
the
teacher
for
her
work
chapter
xxii
experiences
of
the
natural
world
the
first
experiences
the
child
gains
from
the
world
of
nature
are
those
of
beauty
of
sound
colour
and
smell
flowers
at
first
are
just
lovely
and
the
keen
senses
of
a
child
are
more
deeply
satisfied
with
colour
and
scent
than
we
have
any
idea
of
unless
some
faint
memory
of
what
it
meant
remains
with
us
but
he
begins
to
grasp
real
scientific
truth
from
his
experiences
with
the
elements
which
have
for
him
such
a
mysterious
attraction
by
the
very
contact
with
water
something
in
the
child
responds
to
its
stimulus
mud
and
sand
have
their
charms
quite
intangible
but
universal
from
prince
to
coster
a
bonfire
is
something
that
arouses
a
kind
of
primeval
joy
again
race
experience
reproducing
itself
may
account
for
all
this
and
it
must
be
satisfied
the
demand
for
contact
with
the
rest
of
nature
is
a
strong
and
fierce
part
of
human
nature
and
it
means
the
growth
of
something
in
life
that
we
can
not
do
without
we
induce
children
to
come
into
our
schools
when
this
hunger
is
at
its
fiercest
and
very
often
we
do
nothing
to
satisfy
it
but
set
them
in
rooms
to
look
at
things
inanimate
when
their
very
being
is
crying
out
for
life
i
want
something
and
i
do
know
what
to
want
is
the
expression
of
a
state
very
frequent
in
children
and
not
infrequent
in
people
because
they
have
been
balked
of
something
how
then
can
we
provide
for
their
experience
of
this
side
of
life
we
have
tried
to
do
so
in
the
past
by
object
and
nature
lessons
but
we
must
admit
that
they
are
not
the
means
by
which
young
children
seek
to
know
life
or
by
which
they
appreciate
its
beauty
we
have
been
trying
to
kill
too
many
birds
with
one
stone
in
our
economic
way
to
train
the
powers
of
observation
to
teach
a
child
to
express
himself
to
help
a
child
to
gain
useful
knowledge
about
living
things
have
been
the
most
usual
aims
and
the
method
has
been
that
of
minute
examination
of
a
specimen
from
the
plant
or
animal
world
utterly
detached
from
its
surroundings
considered
by
the
docile
child
in
parts
such
as
leaves
stem
roots
petals
and
uses
or
head
wings
legs
tail
and
habits
the
innocent
listener
might
frequently
think
with
reason
that
a
number
lesson
rather
than
a
nature
lesson
was
being
given
the
day
of
the
object
lesson
is
past
and
to
young
children
the
nature
lesson
must
become
nature
work
it
is
in
the
term
nature
lesson
that
the
root
of
the
mischief
lies
nature
is
not
a
lesson
to
the
young
child
it
is
an
interest
from
which
he
seeks
to
gain
more
pleasure
by
means
of
his
own
activity
plants
encourage
him
to
garden
animals
stir
his
desire
to
watch
feed
and
protect
water
earth
and
fire
arouse
his
craving
to
investigate
and
experiment
there
is
no
motive
for
passive
study
at
this
juncture
and
without
a
motive
or
purpose
all
study
leads
to
nothing
adults
compare
and
count
the
various
parts
of
a
living
thing
for
purposes
of
classification
connected
with
the
subdivisions
of
life
which
we
call
botany
and
zoology
but
such
things
are
far
removed
from
the
young
child
world
only
gradually
does
it
begin
to
dawn
on
him
that
there
are
interesting
likenesses
and
that
in
this
world
as
in
his
own
there
are
relationships
when
he
realises
this
the
time
for
a
nature
lesson
has
come
but
much
direct
experience
must
come
first
in
setting
out
the
furnishing
of
the
school
the
need
for
this
activity
is
implied
no
school
worthy
of
the
name
can
do
without
a
garden
any
more
than
it
can
do
without
reading
books
or
blackboards
indeed
the
former
need
is
greater
if
it
is
possible
and
possibilities
gradually
merge
into
acceptances
a
pond
should
be
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
and
trees
should
also
be
considered
as
part
of
the
whole
it
is
not
difficult
for
the
ordinary
person
to
make
a
pond
or
even
to
begin
a
garden
in
a
school
situated
in
london
in
the
midst
of
rows
of
monotonous
little
houses
and
close
to
a
busy
railway
junction
a
miracle
was
performed
the
playground
was
not
very
large
and
of
the
usual
uncompromising
concrete
the
children
most
of
whose
fathers
worked
on
the
railway
lived
in
the
surrounding
streets
and
most
of
them
had
a
of
sorts
they
had
little
or
no
idea
of
a
garden
one
of
the
teachers
had
however
a
vision
which
became
a
reality
she
asked
her
children
to
help
to
make
a
garden
and
for
weeks
every
child
brought
from
his
his
little
paper
bag
of
soil
which
was
deposited
over
some
clinkers
that
were
spread
out
in
a
narrow
border
against
the
outside
wall
in
a
few
months
there
was
a
border
of
two
yards
in
which
flowers
were
planted
the
caretaker
inspired
by
the
sight
did
his
share
of
fixing
a
wooden
strip
as
a
kind
of
supporting
border
to
the
whole
in
two
years
the
garden
had
spread
all
round
the
outside
wall
of
the
playground
and
belonged
to
several
classes
an
even
greater
miracle
was
performed
in
a
school
where
to
most
of
the
children
a
was
a
luxury
beyond
all
possibility
the
school
playground
was
very
small
and
evening
classes
made
a
school
garden
quite
impossible
but
the
head
mistress
was
one
who
saw
life
full
of
possibilities
and
so
she
saw
a
garden
even
in
the
sordidness
round
the
parish
church
was
a
graveyard
long
disused
and
near
one
of
the
gates
a
small
piece
of
ground
that
had
never
been
used
for
any
graveyard
purpose
it
was
near
enough
to
the
school
to
be
possible
and
in
a
short
time
the
miracle
happened
the
entrance
to
the
graveyard
became
a
children
flowering
garden
inside
the
school
where
plants
and
flowers
in
pots
are
numerous
a
part
of
the
morning
should
be
spent
in
the
care
of
these
few
people
know
how
to
arrange
flowers
and
fewer
how
to
feed
and
wash
them
if
there
are
an
aquarium
or
chrysalis
boxes
they
have
to
be
attended
to
all
this
should
be
a
regular
duty
with
a
strong
sense
of
responsibility
attached
to
it
it
is
curious
how
many
people
are
content
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
decaying
matter
if
the
children
enjoy
so
intensely
the
colour
of
the
leaves
and
flowers
they
will
be
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
painting
them
this
is
as
much
a
part
of
nature
work
as
any
other
and
it
should
be
used
as
such
because
it
emphasises
so
strongly
the
side
of
appreciation
of
beauty
a
side
very
often
neglected
it
is
here
that
the
individual
paint
box
is
so
important
if
children
are
to
have
any
sense
of
colour
they
must
learn
to
match
very
truthfully
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
blue
of
the
and
of
the
bluebell
but
only
by
experiment
can
children
discover
that
the
difference
lies
in
the
amount
of
red
in
the
latter
by
means
of
discoveries
of
this
kind
they
will
see
new
colours
in
life
around
them
and
a
new
depth
of
meaning
will
come
to
their
everyday
observations
this
is
true
observation
not
the
look
and
say
of
the
oral
lesson
which
has
no
purpose
in
it
and
leads
to
no
natural
activity
or
to
appreciation
it
is
difficult
to
satisfy
the
interest
in
animals
in
connection
with
the
nursery
school
the
most
suitable
have
been
mentioned
the
transition
and
junior
school
children
may
see
others
when
they
go
for
excursions
at
this
stage
too
children
have
a
great
desire
to
learn
about
wild
animals
and
the
need
often
arises
out
of
their
literature
the
camel
that
brought
rebecca
to
isaac
the
wolf
that
adopted
mowgli
the
reindeer
that
carried
kay
and
gerda
the
fox
that
tried
to
eat
the
seven
little
kids
androcles
lion
and
black
sambo
tiger
might
form
an
interesting
series
helped
by
pictures
of
the
creature
its
own
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
this
may
be
termed
literature
geography
or
nature
study
the
difficulty
serves
to
show
the
unity
of
life
at
this
period
books
such
as
seton
thompson
long
and
kearton
and
many
others
supply
living
experiences
of
animal
life
impossible
to
get
from
less
direct
sources
as
children
get
older
and
have
the
power
to
look
back
they
will
feel
the
necessity
of
keeping
records
and
thus
the
nature
calendar
forerunner
of
geography
will
be
adopted
naturally
another
important
feature
in
nature
experiences
is
the
excursion
froebel
says
not
only
children
and
boys
but
indeed
many
adults
fare
with
nature
and
her
character
as
ordinary
men
fare
with
the
air
they
live
in
it
and
yet
scarcely
know
it
as
something
distinct
therefore
these
children
and
boys
who
spend
all
their
time
in
the
fields
and
forests
see
and
feel
nothing
of
the
beauties
of
nature
and
their
influence
on
the
human
heart
they
are
like
people
who
have
grown
up
in
a
very
beautiful
country
and
who
have
no
idea
of
its
beauty
and
its
spirit
therefore
it
is
so
important
that
boys
and
adults
should
go
into
the
fields
and
forests
together
striving
to
receive
into
their
hearts
and
minds
the
life
and
spirit
of
nature
it
is
evident
from
this
that
excursions
are
as
necessary
in
the
country
as
in
the
town
where
instead
of
the
fields
and
forests
perhaps
only
a
park
is
possible
but
there
is
no
virtue
in
an
excursion
taken
without
preparation
the
teacher
must
first
of
all
visit
the
place
and
see
what
it
is
likely
to
give
the
children
she
must
tell
them
something
of
it
give
them
some
aim
in
going
there
such
as
collecting
leaves
or
fruits
or
recording
different
shapes
of
bare
trees
or
collecting
things
that
grow
in
the
grass
these
are
examples
of
what
a
town
park
might
yield
within
one
group
of
children
there
might
be
many
with
different
aims
during
the
days
following
the
excursion
time
should
be
spent
in
using
these
experiences
either
by
means
of
painting
and
modelling
or
making
classified
collections
of
things
found
or
compiling
records
oral
or
written
otherwise
the
excursion
degenerates
into
a
school
treat
without
its
natural
enjoyment
with
regard
to
the
inevitable
gaps
in
the
children
minds
in
connection
with
the
world
of
living
things
such
pictures
as
the
following
should
be
in
every
town
school
a
pine
wood
a
rabbit
warren
a
natural
pond
a
ditch
and
hedge
a
hayfield
in
june
a
wild
daffodil
patch
a
sheet
of
bluebells
a
cornfield
at
different
stages
an
orchard
in
spring
and
in
autumn
and
many
others
these
must
be
constantly
used
when
they
are
needed
and
not
misused
in
the
artificial
method
known
as
picture
talks
there
is
another
side
to
nature
work
froebel
says
the
things
of
nature
form
a
more
beautiful
ladder
between
heaven
and
earth
than
that
seen
by
jacob
not
a
ladder
leading
in
one
direction
but
an
one
leading
in
all
directions
not
in
dreams
is
it
seen
it
is
permanent
it
surrounds
us
on
all
sides
froebel
believed
that
contact
with
nature
helps
a
child
realisation
of
god
and
any
one
who
believes
in
early
religious
experience
must
agree
a
child
early
questions
and
difficulties
as
well
as
his
early
awe
and
fear
show
it
he
is
probably
nearer
to
god
in
his
nature
work
than
in
many
of
the
scripture
lessons
all
his
education
should
be
permeated
by
spiritual
feeling
but
there
are
some
aspects
in
which
the
realisation
is
clearer
and
possibly
his
contact
with
nature
stands
out
as
the
highest
in
this
respect
there
is
no
conscious
method
or
art
in
bringing
this
about
the
teacher
must
feel
it
and
be
convinced
of
it
thus
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
nursery
school
nature
work
can
be
safely
left
to
look
after
itself
provided
the
surroundings
are
satisfying
and
the
children
are
free
in
the
transition
and
the
junior
school
there
should
be
no
nature
lessons
of
the
object
lesson
type
but
plenty
of
nature
work
leading
to
talks
handwork
and
poetry
the
aim
is
not
economic
or
informational
at
this
stage
but
the
development
of
pure
appreciation
and
interest
there
can
hardly
be
a
regular
place
on
the
for
such
irregular
work
comprising
excursions
gardening
handwork
and
literature
at
least
and
depending
on
the
weather
and
the
seasons
there
should
always
be
a
regular
morning
time
for
attending
to
plants
and
animals
and
for
the
nature
calendar
but
no
living
teacher
will
be
a
slave
to
mere
thraldom

experiences
of
mathematical
truths
by
means
of
toys
handwork
and
games
as
well
as
various
private
individual
experiments
a
child
touches
on
most
sides
of
mathematics
in
the
nursery
class
in
experimenting
with
bricks
he
must
of
necessity
have
considered
relative
size
balance
and
adjustment
form
and
symmetry
in
fitting
them
back
into
their
boxes
some
of
the
most
difficult
problems
of
cubic
content
in
weighing
out
pretence
sugar
and
butter
by
means
of
sand
and
clay
new
problems
are
there
for
consideration
in
making
a
questions
of
measurement
evolve
this
is
all
in
the
incidental
play
of
the
nursery
school
and
yet
we
might
say
that
a
child
thus
occupied
is
learning
mathematics
more
than
anything
else
here
if
he
remained
till
six
he
did
a
certain
amount
of
necessary
counting
and
he
may
have
acquired
skill
in
recognising
groups
he
may
have
unconsciously
and
incidentally
performed
achievements
in
the
four
rules
but
never
of
course
in
any
shortened
or
technical
form
probably
he
knows
some
figures
it
is
best
to
give
these
to
a
child
when
he
asks
for
or
needs
them
as
in
the
case
of
records
of
games
on
the
other
hand
he
may
be
content
with
strokes
various
mathematical
relationships
are
made
clear
in
his
games
or
trials
of
strength
such
as
distance
in
relation
to
time
or
strength
weight
in
relation
to
power
and
to
balance
length
and
breadth
in
relation
to
materials
value
of
material
in
relation
to
money
or
work
by
means
of
many
of
his
toys
the
properties
of
solids
have
become
working
knowledge
to
him
here
then
is
our
for
the
transition
period
after
the
nursery
stage
undoubtedly
the
aim
of
the
transition
class
is
partly
to
continue
by
means
of
games
and
dramatic
play
the
kind
of
knowledge
gained
in
the
nursery
school
but
it
has
also
the
task
of
beginning
to
organise
such
knowledge
as
the
grouping
into
tens
and
hundreds
this
organisation
of
raw
material
and
the
presenting
of
shortened
processes
as
occur
in
the
first
four
rules
forms
the
work
also
of
the
junior
school
to
give
to
a
child
shortened
processes
which
he
would
be
very
unlikely
to
discover
in
less
than
a
lifetime
is
simply
giving
him
the
experience
of
the
race
as
primitive
man
did
to
his
son
but
the
important
point
is
to
decide
when
a
child
discovery
should
end
and
the
teacher
demonstration
begin
this
is
the
period
when
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
beginning
abstract
work
it
is
well
to
be
clear
what
it
means
and
how
it
stands
related
to
a
child
need
for
experience
when
we
leave
the
problems
of
life
such
as
shopping
keeping
records
of
games
and
making
measurements
for
construction
and
when
we
begin
to
work
with
pure
number
we
are
said
to
be
dealing
with
the
abstract
formerly
dealing
with
pure
number
was
called
simple
and
dealing
with
actual
things
such
as
money
and
measures
compound
and
they
were
taken
in
this
order
but
experience
has
reversed
the
process
and
a
child
comes
to
see
the
need
of
abstract
practice
when
he
finds
he
is
not
quick
enough
or
accurate
enough
or
his
setting
out
seems
clumsy
in
actual
problems
this
was
discussed
at
greater
length
in
the
chapter
on
play
for
instance
he
might
set
down
the
points
of
a
game
by
strokes
each
line
representing
a
different
opponent
john
henry
tom
he
will
see
how
difficult
it
is
to
estimate
at
a
glance
the
exact
score
and
how
easy
it
is
to
be
inaccurate
it
seems
the
moment
to
show
him
that
the
idea
of
grouping
or
enclosing
a
certain
number
and
always
keeping
to
the
same
grouping
is
helpful
john
ten
and
singles
henry
ten
and
single
tom
singles
after
doing
this
a
good
many
times
he
could
be
told
that
this
is
a
universal
method
and
he
would
doubtless
enjoy
the
purely
puzzle
pleasure
in
working
long
sums
to
perfect
practice
this
pleasure
is
very
common
in
children
at
this
stage
but
too
often
it
comes
to
them
merely
through
being
shown
the
trick
of
carrying
tens
they
have
reached
a
purely
abstract
point
but
they
can
not
get
through
it
without
some
more
material
help
the
following
is
an
example
of
the
kind
of
help
that
can
be
given
in
getting
clear
the
concept
of
the
ten
grouping
and
the
processes
it
involves
illustration
board
with
hooks
in
ranks
of
nine
and
rings
the
whole
apparatus
is
a
rectangular
piece
of
wood
about
of
an
inch
thick
and
about
feet
of
surface
it
is
painted
white
and
the
horizontal
bars
are
green
so
that
the
divisions
may
be
apparent
at
a
distance
it
has
perpendicular
divisions
breaking
it
up
into
three
columns
each
of
which
contains
rows
of
nine
small
dresser
hooks
it
can
be
hung
on
an
easel
or
supported
by
its
own
hinge
on
a
table
each
of
the
divisions
represents
a
numerical
grouping
the
one
on
the
right
is
for
singles
or
units
the
central
one
for
tens
and
the
left
side
one
for
hundreds
the
counters
used
are
button
moulds
dipped
in
red
ink
with
small
loops
of
string
to
hang
on
the
hooks
it
is
easily
seen
by
a
child
that
after
nine
is
reached
the
units
can
no
longer
remain
in
their
division
or
house
but
must
be
gathered
together
into
a
bunch
fastened
by
a
safety
pin
and
fixed
on
one
of
the
hooks
of
the
middle
division
sums
of
two
or
three
lines
can
thus
be
set
out
on
the
horizontal
bars
and
in
processes
of
addition
the
answer
can
be
on
the
bottom
line
it
is
very
easy
by
this
concrete
means
to
see
the
process
in
subtraction
and
indeed
the
whole
difficulty
of
dealing
with
ten
is
made
concrete
the
whole
of
a
sum
can
be
gone
through
on
this
board
with
the
and
on
boards
and
chalk
with
figures
side
by
side
thus
interpreting
symbol
by
material
but
the
whole
process
is
abstract
the
piece
of
apparatus
is
less
abstract
only
in
degree
than
the
figures
on
the
blackboard
because
neither
represents
real
life
or
its
problems
in
abstract
working
we
are
merely
going
off
at
a
side
issue
for
the
sake
of
practice
to
make
us
more
competent
to
deal
with
the
economic
affairs
of
life
there
is
a
place
for
sticks
and
counters
and
there
is
a
place
for
money
and
measures
but
they
are
not
the
same
the
former
represents
the
abstract
and
the
latter
the
concrete
problem
if
used
as
in
real
life
the
bridge
between
the
abstract
and
the
concrete
is
largely
the
work
of
the
transition
class
and
junior
school
in
respect
of
the
foundations
of
arithmetic
known
as
the
first
four
rules
games
of
skill
very
thorough
shopping
or
keeping
a
bankbook
or
selling
tickets
for
tram
or
train
represent
the
kind
of
everyday
problem
that
should
be
the
centre
of
the
arithmetic
work
at
this
transition
stage
and
out
of
the
necessities
of
these
problems
the
abstract
and
work
should
come
but
it
should
precede
the
real
work
a
real
purpose
should
underlie
it
all
a
purpose
that
is
apparent
and
stimulating
enough
to
produce
willing
practice
a
child
will
do
much
to
be
a
good
shopkeeper
a
good
tram
conductor
a
good
banker
he
will
always
play
the
game
for
all
it
is
worth

xxiv
experiences
by
means
of
doing
in
the
nursery
school
activity
is
the
chief
characteristic
one
of
its
most
usual
forms
is
experimenting
with
tools
and
materials
such
as
chalk
paints
scissors
paper
sand
clay
and
other
things
the
desire
to
experiment
to
change
the
material
in
some
way
to
gratify
the
senses
especially
the
muscular
one
may
be
stronger
than
the
desire
to
construct
the
handwork
play
of
the
nursery
school
is
therefore
chiefly
by
means
of
imitation
and
experiment
and
direct
help
is
usually
quite
unwelcome
to
the
child
under
six
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
in
the
way
of
direction
than
provide
suitable
material
give
freedom
and
help
if
the
child
wants
it
but
the
case
is
rather
different
in
the
transitional
stage
as
the
race
learnt
to
think
by
doing
so
children
seem
to
approach
thought
in
that
way
they
have
a
natural
inclination
to
do
in
the
first
case
they
try
do
wrongly
consider
examine
observe
and
do
again
for
example
a
girl
wants
to
make
a
doll
bonnet
like
the
baby
she
begins
impulsively
to
cut
out
the
stuff
finds
it
too
small
tries
to
visualise
the
right
size
examines
the
real
bonnet
and
makes
another
attempt
at
some
apparently
odd
moment
she
stumbles
on
a
truth
perhaps
the
relation
of
one
form
to
another
in
the
mazes
of
it
is
at
these
odd
moments
that
we
learn
or
a
boy
may
be
painting
a
christmas
card
and
in
another
odd
moment
he
may
something
of
the
beauty
of
colour
if
for
example
he
is
copying
no
purposeless
looking
at
them
would
have
stirred
appreciation
whether
the
end
is
doing
or
whether
it
is
thinking
the
two
are
inextricably
connected
in
the
earlier
stages
the
way
to
know
and
feel
is
very
often
by
action
and
here
is
the
basis
of
the
maxim
that
handwork
is
a
method
this
idea
has
often
been
only
half
digested
and
consequently
it
has
led
to
a
very
trivial
kind
of
application
a
nature
lesson
of
the
look
and
say
description
has
been
followed
by
a
painting
lesson
a
geography
lesson
by
the
making
of
a
model
if
the
method
of
learning
by
doing
was
the
accepted
aim
of
the
teacher
then
it
was
not
carried
out
for
this
is
learning
and
then
doing
not
learning
for
the
purpose
of
doing
but
doing
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
learning
which
is
quite
another
matter
and
not
a
very
natural
procedure
with
young
children
many
people
have
tried
to
make
things
from
printed
directions
a
woman
may
try
to
make
a
blouse
and
a
man
to
make
a
their
procedure
is
not
to
separate
the
doing
and
the
learning
process
probably
they
have
first
tried
to
do
found
need
for
help
and
gone
to
the
printed
directions
which
they
followed
side
by
side
with
the
doing
and
in
the
light
of
former
failures
or
in
the
course
of
looking
or
of
experimenting
they
stumbled
upon
knowledge
this
is
learning
by
doing
therefore
the
making
of
a
box
may
be
arithmetic
the
painting
of
a
buttercup
may
be
nature
study
the
construction
of
a
model
or
of
dramatic
properties
may
be
geography
or
history
not
by
any
means
the
only
way
of
learning
but
one
of
the
earlier
ways
and
a
very
sound
way
there
is
a
purpose
to
serve
behind
it
all
that
will
lead
to
very
careful
discrimination
in
selection
of
knowledge
and
to
pains
taken
to
retain
it
if
this
is
fully
understood
by
a
teacher
and
she
is
content
to
take
nature
way
and
abide
for
nature
time
to
see
results
then
her
methods
will
be
appropriately
applied
she
will
see
that
she
is
not
training
a
race
of
but
that
she
is
guiding
children
to
discover
things
that
they
need
to
know
in
a
natural
way
and
ensuring
that
as
these
facts
are
discovered
they
shall
be
used
consequently
neither
haste
nor
perfection
of
finish
must
cloud
the
aim
it
is
not
the
output
that
matters
but
the
method
by
which
the
children
arrive
at
the
finished
object
not
forty
good
boxes
but
forty
good
thinkers
dewey
has
put
it
most
clearly
when
he
says
that
the
right
test
of
an
occupation
consists
in
putting
the
maximum
of
consciousness
into
whatever
is
done
froebel
says
what
man
tries
to
represent
or
do
he
begins
to
understand
this
is
what
we
should
mean
by
saying
that
handwork
is
a
method
of
learning
but
handwork
has
its
own
absolute
place
as
well
a
child
wants
to
acquire
skill
in
this
direction
even
more
consciously
than
he
wants
to
learn
if
he
has
been
free
in
the
nursery
class
to
experiment
with
materials
and
if
he
knows
some
of
his
limitations
he
is
now
in
the
transition
class
ready
for
help
and
he
should
get
it
as
he
needs
it
this
may
run
side
by
side
with
the
more
didactic
side
of
handwork
which
has
been
described
but
it
is
more
likely
that
in
practice
the
two
are
inextricably
mixed
up
and
this
does
not
matter
if
the
two
ends
are
clear
in
the
teacher
mind
both
sides
have
to
be
reckoned
with
the
important
thing
to
know
is
the
kind
of
help
that
should
be
given
and
when
and
how
it
is
needed
it
is
well
to
remember
that
in
this
connection
a
child
limitations
are
not
final
but
only
mark
stages
for
example
in
his
early
attempts
to
use
thick
cardboard
he
can
not
discover
the
neat
hinge
that
is
made
by
the
process
known
as
a
he
tries
in
vain
to
bend
the
cardboard
so
as
to
secure
the
same
result
there
are
two
ways
of
helping
him
either
he
can
be
quite
definitely
shown
and
made
to
imitate
or
he
can
be
set
to
think
about
it
he
is
given
a
cardboard
knife
and
allowed
to
experiment
if
he
fails
it
may
be
suggested
that
a
clean
edge
can
only
be
got
by
some
form
of
cutting
probably
he
will
find
out
the
rest
of
the
process
the
second
method
is
the
better
one
because
it
promotes
thinking
while
the
first
only
promotes
pure
imitation
and
the
habit
of
reckoning
on
this
easy
solution
of
difficulties
a
dull
child
may
have
to
be
shown
but
there
are
few
such
children
unless
they
have
been
trained
to
dulness
imitation
is
not
however
always
a
medicine
for
dulness
nor
does
it
always
produce
dulness
there
is
a
time
for
imitation
and
there
is
a
kind
of
imitation
that
is
very
intelligent
for
example
a
child
may
come
across
a
toy
aeroplane
and
wish
to
make
one
he
will
examine
it
carefully
think
over
the
uses
of
parts
and
proceed
to
make
one
as
like
it
as
possible
here
again
is
the
maximum
of
consciousness
the
essence
of
thinking
or
the
imitation
may
consist
in
following
verbal
directions
this
is
far
from
easy
if
the
teacher
is
at
all
vague
and
promotes
valuable
effort
if
she
is
clear
but
not
diffuse
the
putting
of
words
into
action
necessitates
a
considerable
amount
of
imagining
and
the
establishment
of
very
important
associations
in
brain
centres
such
cases
might
occur
in
connection
with
weaving
cardboard
and
paper
work
or
the
more
technical
processes
of
drawing
and
painting
where
race
experience
is
actually
to
a
child
by
means
of
which
he
leaps
over
the
experiences
of
centuries
this
is
progress
if
a
teacher
is
to
take
handwork
seriously
and
not
as
a
pretty
recreation
with
pleasing
results
she
should
be
fully
conscious
of
all
that
it
means
and
apply
this
definitely
in
her
work
it
is
so
easy
to
be
trivial
while
appearing
to
be
thorough
by
having
work
produced
which
has
necessitated
little
hard
thinking
on
the
part
construction
gives
a
sense
of
power
a
strengthening
of
the
will
ability
to
concentrate
on
a
purpose
in
learning
a
social
sense
of
serviceableness
a
deepened
individuality
but
this
can
only
be
looked
for
if
a
child
is
allowed
to
approach
it
in
the
right
way
first
as
an
experimenter
and
investigator
or
as
an
artist
and
afterwards
as
a
learner
who
is
also
an
individual
and
learns
in
his
own
way
and
at
his
own
rate
but
if
the
teacher
ambition
is
external
and
economic
then
the
child
is
a
tool
in
her
hands
and
will
remain
a
tool
we
can
not
expect
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
if
our
goal
is
a
material
one
one
of
the
lessons
of
the
war
is
economy
in
handwork
this
has
come
to
us
through
the
quest
for
materials
but
it
has
been
a
blessing
if
now
and
then
in
disguise
in
the
more
formal
period
of
handwork
only
prepared
almost
patented
material
was
used
everything
was
requisitioned
and
eager
manufacturers
supplied
very
highly
finished
stuff
not
very
many
years
ago
the
keeper
of
a
kindergarten
stall
at
an
exhibition
said
while
pointing
to
cards
cut
and
printed
with
outlines
for
sewing
and
pricking
we
have
so
many
orders
for
these
that
we
can
afford
to
lay
down
considerable
plant
for
their
production
an
example
in
another
direction
is
that
of
a
little
girl
who
attended
one
of
the
best
kindergartens
of
the
time
she
was
afflicted
while
at
home
with
the
do
know
what
to
do
malady
her
mother
suggested
that
she
might
make
some
of
the
things
she
made
at
school
but
she
negatived
that
at
once
with
the
remark
i
could
do
that
you
see
because
we
have
none
of
the
right
kind
of
stuff
to
make
them
of
here
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
give
more
direct
details
as
to
the
kind
of
work
suitable
and
the
method
of
doing
it
more
than
enough
books
of
help
have
been
published
on
every
kind
of
material
and
it
might
perhaps
be
well
if
we
made
less
use
of
such
terms
as
raffia
and
took
handwork
more
in
the
sense
of
constructive
or
expressive
work
letting
the
children
select
one
or
several
media
for
their
purpose
they
ought
to
have
access
to
a
variety
of
material
and
except
when
they
waste
they
should
use
it
freely
it
is
limiting
and
unenlightened
to
put
down
a
special
time
for
the
use
of
special
material
if
the
end
might
be
better
answered
by
something
else
if
modelling
is
at
on
monday
and
children
are
anxious
to
make
christmas
presents
what
law
in
heaven
or
earth
are
we
obeying
if
we
stick
to
modelling
except
the
law
of
red
tape
chapter
xxv
experiences
of
the
life
of
man
this
aspect
of
experience
comes
in
two
forms
the
life
of
man
in
the
past
with
the
memorials
and
legacies
he
has
left
and
the
life
of
man
in
the
present
under
the
varying
conditions
of
climate
and
all
that
it
involves
in
other
words
these
experiences
are
commonly
known
as
history
and
geography
though
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
appearance
in
school
it
is
perhaps
better
to
call
the
work
preparation
for
history
and
geography
they
would
naturally
appear
in
the
transition
or
the
junior
class
preferably
in
the
latter
but
they
need
not
be
wholly
new
subjects
to
a
child
his
literature
has
prepared
him
for
both
to
some
extent
his
experiments
in
handwork
have
prepared
him
for
history
while
his
nature
work
especially
his
excursions
and
records
have
prepared
him
for
geography
that
he
needs
this
extension
of
experience
can
be
seen
in
his
growing
demands
for
true
stories
true
in
the
more
literal
sense
which
he
is
coming
fast
to
appreciate
undoubtedly
most
children
pass
through
a
stage
of
extreme
literalism
between
early
childhood
and
what
is
generally
recognised
as
boyhood
and
girlhood
they
begin
to
ask
questions
regarding
the
past
they
are
interested
in
things
from
abroad
however
vague
that
term
may
be
to
them
perhaps
it
will
be
best
to
treat
the
two
subjects
separately
though
like
all
the
child
curriculum
at
this
stage
they
are
inextricably
confused
and
mingled
both
with
each
other
and
with
literature
as
experiences
of
man
life
and
conduct
the
beginnings
of
geography
lie
in
the
child
foundations
of
experience
probably
the
first
real
contact
unconscious
though
it
may
be
that
any
child
has
in
this
connection
is
through
the
production
of
food
and
clothing
a
country
child
sees
some
of
the
beginnings
of
both
but
it
is
doubtful
how
much
of
it
is
really
interpreted
by
him
the
village
shop
with
its
inexhaustible
stores
probably
means
much
more
in
the
way
of
origins
and
he
may
never
go
behind
its
contents
in
his
speculations
it
is
true
he
sees
milking
harvesting
and
many
other
operations
but
he
often
misses
the
stage
between
the
actual
beginning
and
the
finished
product
between
the
wool
on
the
sheep
back
and
his
sunday
clothes
between
the
wheat
in
the
field
and
his
loaf
of
bread
the
town
child
has
many
links
if
he
can
use
them
the
goods
train
the
docks
the
grocer
or
draper
shop
foreigners
in
the
street
the
vans
that
come
through
the
silent
streets
in
the
early
morning
in
big
towns
such
markets
as
covent
garden
or
leadenhall
or
smithfield
such
a
river
as
the
thames
humber
or
mersey
from
any
one
of
these
beginnings
he
can
reach
out
from
his
own
small
environment
to
the
world
a
town
child
has
very
confused
notions
of
what
a
farm
really
means
to
national
life
and
a
country
child
of
what
a
big
railway
station
or
dock
involves
all
children
need
to
know
what
other
parts
of
their
own
land
look
like
and
what
is
produced
they
ought
to
trace
the
products
within
reach
to
their
origin
and
this
will
involve
descriptions
of
such
things
as
fisheries
at
hull
or
aberdeen
the
coal
mines
of
wales
or
lanarkshire
pottery
districts
of
stafford
woollen
and
cotton
factories
of
yorkshire
and
lancashire
mills
driven
by
steam
wind
and
water
lighthouses
the
districts
of
cumberland
and
midlothian
the
of
northern
ireland
and
much
else
and
the
means
of
transit
and
communication
between
all
these
the
children
will
gradually
realise
that
many
of
the
things
they
are
familiar
with
such
as
tea
oranges
silk
and
sugar
have
not
been
accounted
for
and
this
will
take
them
to
the
lives
of
people
in
other
countries
the
means
of
getting
there
the
time
taken
and
mode
of
travelling
they
will
also
come
to
see
that
we
do
not
produce
enough
of
the
things
that
are
possible
to
grow
such
as
wheat
apples
wool
and
many
other
common
necessaries
and
that
we
can
spare
much
that
is
manufactured
to
countries
that
do
not
make
them
such
as
boots
clothes
china
and
cutlery
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
need
for
a
map
is
apparent
that
is
the
time
to
branch
off
from
the
main
theme
and
make
one
it
will
have
to
be
of
the
very
immediate
surroundings
first
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
the
leap
soon
to
countries
beyond
previous
to
the
need
for
it
is
useless
this
working
outwards
from
actual
experiences
from
the
home
country
to
the
foreign
from
actual
contact
with
real
things
to
things
of
travellers
tales
is
the
only
way
to
bring
geography
to
the
very
door
of
the
school
to
make
it
part
of
the
actual
life
the
beginning
of
history
as
of
geography
lies
in
the
foundations
of
experience
in
the
country
village
he
sees
the
church
possibly
some
old
cottages
or
an
elizabethan
or
jacobean
house
near
in
the
churchyard
or
in
the
church
the
tombstones
have
quaint
inscriptions
with
reference
possibly
to
past
wars
or
to
early
colonisation
the
slum
child
on
the
other
hand
sees
much
that
is
worn
out
but
little
that
is
antiquated
unless
the
slum
happen
to
be
in
such
places
as
edinburgh
or
deptford
situated
among
the
remains
of
really
fine
houses
but
he
realises
more
of
the
technicalities
and
officialism
of
a
social
system
than
does
the
country
child
the
suburban
child
has
probably
the
scantiest
store
of
all
his
district
is
presumably
made
up
of
rows
of
respectable
but
monotonous
houses
and
the
social
life
is
similarly
respectable
and
monotonous
there
are
certain
cravings
interests
and
needs
common
to
all
children
which
come
regardless
of
surroundings
all
children
want
to
know
certain
things
about
people
who
lived
before
them
not
so
much
their
great
doings
as
their
smaller
ones
they
want
to
know
what
these
people
were
like
what
they
worked
at
and
learnt
how
they
travelled
what
they
bought
and
sold
and
there
is
undoubtedly
a
primitive
strain
in
all
children
that
comes
out
in
their
love
of
building
shelters
playing
at
savages
and
making
things
out
of
natural
material
one
of
the
most
intense
moments
in
to
many
children
is
the
building
of
the
little
house
in
the
wood
and
later
on
of
the
other
on
the
top
of
the
trees
that
is
the
little
house
of
their
dreams
they
are
not
interested
in
constitutions
or
the
making
of
laws
wars
and
invasions
have
much
the
same
kind
of
interest
for
them
as
the
adventures
of
una
and
the
red
cross
knight
how
are
these
cravings
usually
satisfied
in
the
early
stages
of
history
teaching
of
as
a
rule
a
series
of
biographies
of
notable
people
is
given
regardless
of
chronology
or
the
children
previous
experiences
and
equally
careless
of
the
history
lessons
of
the
future
joan
of
arc
alfred
and
the
cakes
gordon
of
khartoum
boadicea
christopher
columbus
julius
caesar
form
a
list
which
is
not
at
all
uncommon
there
is
no
leading
thread
no
developing
idea
and
the
old
test
the
children
like
it
excuses
indolent
thinking
on
the
other
hand
the
desire
to
know
more
of
the
robinson
crusoe
mode
of
life
has
been
apparent
to
many
teachers
for
some
time
but
the
material
at
their
disposal
has
been
scanty
and
uncertain
it
is
to
dewey
that
we
owe
the
right
organisation
of
this
part
of
history
he
has
shown
that
it
is
on
the
side
of
industry
the
early
modes
of
weaving
cooking
lighting
and
heating
making
implements
for
war
and
for
hunting
and
making
of
shelters
that
prehistoric
man
has
a
real
contribution
to
give
but
for
the
beginnings
of
social
life
for
realisation
of
such
imperishable
virtues
as
courage
patriotism
and
children
must
go
to
the
lives
of
real
people
and
gradually
acquire
the
idea
that
certain
things
are
so
to
speak
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
while
others
change
with
changing
and
growing
circumstances
the
prehistoric
history
should
be
largely
concerned
with
doing
and
experimenting
with
making
weapons
or
firing
clay
or
weaving
rushes
or
with
visits
to
such
museums
as
horniman
at
forest
hill
the
early
social
history
may
well
take
the
form
best
suited
to
the
child
and
not
appeal
merely
to
surface
interest
and
the
spirit
in
which
the
lives
of
other
people
are
presented
to
children
must
not
be
the
narrow
prejudiced
insular
one
so
long
associated
with
the
people
of
great
britain
which
calls
other
customs
dress
modes
of
living
funny
or
absurd
or
extraordinary
but
rather
the
scientific
spirit
that
interprets
life
according
to
its
conditions
and
so
builds
up
one
of
its
greatest
laws
the
law
of
environment
the
geography
syllabus
even
more
than
the
history
one
depends
for
its
beginnings
at
least
on
the
surroundings
of
the
school
out
of
the
mass
of
possible
materials
a
very
rich
and
comprehensive
syllabus
can
be
made
beginning
with
any
one
of
the
central
points
already
suggested
above
all
there
should
be
plenty
of
pictures
not
as
amplification
but
as
material
by
means
of
which
a
child
may
interpret
more
fully
a
picture
should
be
of
the
nature
of
a
problem
or
of
a
map
and
picture
reading
should
be
in
the
junior
school
what
map
reading
is
in
the
upper
school
in
both
history
and
geography
the
method
is
partly
that
of
discovery
especially
is
this
the
case
in
that
part
of
history
which
deals
with
primitive
industries
and
in
almost
the
whole
of
the
geography
of
this
period
the
teacher
is
the
guide
or
leader
in
discovery
not
the
merely
though
this
may
be
part
of
his
function
the
following
is
a
small
part
of
a
syllabus
to
show
how
geography
and
history
material
may
grow
naturally
out
of
the
children
experiences
it
is
meant
in
this
case
for
children
in
a
london
suburb
with
no
particular
characteristics
geography
it
grows
out
of
the
shops
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
adjoining
railway
system

tracing
of
fruit
to
its
own
home
source
or
to
a
foreign

experiences
recorded
and
passed
on
reading
and
writing
are
held
to
have
lifted
man
above
the
brute
they
are
the
means
by
which
we
can
discover
and
record
human
experience
and
progress
and
as
such
their
value
is
incalculable
but
in
themselves
they
are
artificial
conventions
symbols
invented
for
the
convenience
of
mankind
and
to
acquire
them
we
need
exercise
no
great
mental
power
a
good
eye
and
ear
memory
and
a
certain
superficial
quickness
to
recognise
and
apply
previous
knowledge
is
all
that
is
needed
for
reading
and
spelling
while
for
writing
the
development
of
a
specialised
muscular
skill
is
all
that
is
necessary
in
themselves
they
do
not
as
a
rule
hold
any
great
interest
for
a
child
sometimes
they
have
the
same
puzzle
interest
as
a
long
addition
sum
and
to
children
of
a
certain
type
mechanical
work
such
as
writing
gives
relief
one
of
the
most
docile
and
uninteresting
of
little
boys
said
that
writing
was
his
favourite
subject
and
it
was
easy
to
understand
he
did
not
want
to
be
stirred
out
of
his
commonplaceness
unconsciously
he
had
assimilated
the
atmosphere
and
adopted
the
standards
of
his
surroundings
which
were
monotonous
and
commonplace
in
the
extreme
and
so
he
desired
no
more
adventurous
method
of
expression
than
the
process
of
writing
which
he
could
do
well
imitation
is
often
a
strong
incentive
to
reading
it
is
part
of
the
craving
for
to
many
children
they
desire
to
do
what
their
brothers
and
sisters
can
do
but
the
first
stage
of
childhood
roughly
up
to
the
age
of
six
or
even
later
no
child
needs
to
learn
to
read
or
write
taking
need
in
the
psychological
sense
that
period
is
concerned
with
laying
the
foundation
of
real
things
and
with
learning
surroundings
any
records
of
experience
that
come
to
a
child
can
come
as
they
did
to
his
earliest
forefathers
by
word
of
mouth
when
he
wants
to
read
stories
for
himself
or
write
his
own
letters
then
he
is
impelled
by
a
sufficiently
strong
aim
or
incentive
to
make
concentration
possible
without
resorting
to
any
of
the
fantastic
devices
and
apparatus
so
dear
to
so
many
teachers
indeed
it
is
safe
to
say
of
many
of
these
devices
that
they
prove
the
fact
that
children
are
not
ready
for
reading
when
a
child
is
ready
to
read
and
write
the
process
need
not
be
a
long
one
by
wise
delay
many
tedious
hours
are
saved
tedious
to
both
teacher
and
children
they
have
already
learnt
to
talk
in
those
precious
hours
to
discriminate
sounds
as
part
of
language
training
but
without
any
resort
to
symbols
merely
as
something
natural
it
has
been
amply
proved
that
if
a
child
is
not
prematurely
forced
into
reading
he
can
do
as
much
in
one
year
as
he
would
have
done
in
three
under
more
strained
conditions
with
regard
to
methods
a
great
deal
has
been
written
on
the
subject
it
is
pretty
safe
to
leave
a
teacher
to
choose
her
own
for
much
of
the
elaboration
is
unnecessary
if
reading
is
rightly
delayed
and
if
a
child
can
read
reasonably
well
at
seven
and
a
half
there
can
be
no
grounds
for
complaint
if
his
phonetic
training
has
been
good
in
the
earlier
stages
of
language
then
this
may
be
combined
with
the
look
and
say
method
or
method
of
reading
by
whole
words
the
cat
on
the
mat
type
of
book
is
disappearing
and
its
place
is
being
taken
by
books
where
the
subject
matter
is
interesting
and
suitable
to
the
child
age
but
as
in
other
subjects
the
book
chosen
should
be
considered
in
reference
to
the
child
surroundings
either
to
amplify
or
to
extend
writing
is
in
the
first
instance
a
part
of
reading
when
words
are
being
learnt
they
must
be
written
or
in
the
earliest
stages
printed
but
only
those
interesting
to
the
children
and
written
for
some
definite
purpose
should
be
selected
a
great
aid
to
spelling
is
transcription
and
children
are
always
willing
to
copy
something
they
like
such
as
a
verse
of
poetry
or
their
name
and
address
as
in
arithmetic
and
in
handwork
they
will
come
to
recognise
the
need
for
practice
and
be
willing
to
undergo
such
exercise
for
the
sake
of
improvement
as
well
as
for
the
pleasure
in
the
activity
which
actual
writing
gives
to
some
children
we
must
be
quite
clear
about
relative
values
reading
and
writing
are
necessities
and
the
means
of
opening
up
to
us
things
of
great
value
but
the
art
of
acquiring
them
is
of
little
intrinsic
value
and
the
recognition
of
the
need
is
not
an
early
one
nothing
is
gained
by
beginning
too
early
and
much
valuable
time
is
taken
from
other
activities
notably
language
the
incentive
should
be
the
need
that
the
child
feels
and
when
this
is
evident
time
and
pains
should
be
given
to
the
subject
so
that
it
maybe
quickly
acquired
but
the
art
of
reading
is
no
test
of
intelligence
and
the
art
of
writing
is
no
test
of
original
skill
claims
of
the
upper
departments

chapter
xxvii
the
things
that
really
matter
the
thing
that
matters
is
what
is
commonly
called
the
personality
of
the
teacher
she
must
be
a
person
unmistakable
from
other
persons
and
not
a
type
what
she
has
as
an
individual
of
gifts
or
goodness
she
should
give
freely
and
give
in
her
own
way
that
she
should
be
trained
is
of
course
as
indisputable
as
the
training
of
a
doctor
but
her
training
should
have
deepened
her
personality
pestalozzi
curriculum
and
organisation
left
much
to
be
desired
what
he
has
handed
down
to
us
came
from
himself
and
his
own
experience
not
from
anything
superimposed
records
of
his
pupils
constantly
emphasise
this
it
was
his
goodness
assimilated
with
his
outlook
on
life
and
readiness
to
learn
by
experience
that
mattered
and
it
was
this
that
remained
with
his
pupils
the
teacher
own
personality
must
dominate
her
choice
of
principles
else
she
is
a
dead
method
a
machine
and
not
a
living
teacher
she
must
not
keep
her
interests
and
gifts
for
use
if
she
has
a
sense
of
humour
she
must
use
it
if
she
is
fond
of
pretty
clothes
she
must
wear
them
in
school
if
she
appreciates
music
she
must
help
her
class
to
do
the
same
if
she
has
dramatic
gifts
she
must
act
to
them
her
standard
of
goodness
must
be
high
and
she
must
be
strong
enough
to
adopt
it
practically
so
that
she
is
unconscious
of
it
goodness
and
righteousness
are
as
essential
as
health
to
a
teacher
for
something
intangible
passes
from
the
teacher
to
her
children
however
young
and
unconscious
they
may
be
and
nothing
can
awaken
goodness
but
goodness
part
of
her
personality
is
her
attitude
towards
religion
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
a
teacher
of
young
children
who
is
not
religious
whose
conduct
is
not
definitely
permeated
by
her
spiritual
life
young
children
are
essentially
religious
and
the
life
of
the
spirit
must
find
a
response
in
the
same
kind
of
intangible
assumption
of
its
existence
as
goodness
no
form
of
creed
or
dogma
is
meant
only
the
life
of
the
spirit
common
to
all
but
of
course
there
may
be
people
who
refuse
to
admit
this
as
a
necessity
the
thing
that
matters
is
that
all
children
must
be
regarded
as
individuals
there
has
been
much
more
talk
of
this
lately
but
practical
difficulties
are
often
raised
as
a
bar
if
teachers
and
parents
continue
to
accept
the
conditions
which
make
it
difficult
such
as
large
classes
and
a
need
to
hasten
there
will
always
be
a
bar
if
individuality
is
held
as
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
education
authorities
can
not
continue
to
economise
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
it
is
the
individual
part
of
each
child
that
is
his
most
precious
possession
his
immortal
side
froebel
calls
it
his
divine
essence
and
makes
the
cultivation
of
it
the
aim
of
education
he
is
right
and
any
more
general
aim
will
lead
only
to
human
beings
if
we
accept
the
principle
that
only
goodness
is
fundamental
and
evil
a
distortion
of
nature
we
need
have
no
fear
about
cultivating
individuals
every
doctor
assures
us
that
all
normal
babies
are
naturally
healthy
they
are
also
naturally
good
but
evil
is
easily
aroused
by
arbitrary
interference
or
by
mismanagement
the
thing
that
matters
belongs
more
especially
to
the
intellectual
life
it
might
be
described
as
the
making
of
right
associations
more
than
any
other
side
of
training
the
making
of
associations
means
the
making
of
the
intelligent
person
to
see
life
in
patches
is
to
see
pieces
of
a
great
picture
by
the
square
inch
and
never
to
see
the
relationship
of
these
to
each
other
never
to
see
the
whole
the
thing
that
matters
is
the
making
of
good
and
serviceable
habits
much
has
been
said
on
this
in
connection
with
the
nursery
class
and
it
is
at
that
stage
that
the
process
is
most
important
but
it
should
never
cease
if
a
child
is
to
have
time
and
opportunity
to
develop
his
individuality
he
must
not
be
hampered
by
having
to
be
conscious
of
things
that
belong
to
the
subconscious
region
to
start
a
child
with
a
foundation
of
good
habits
is
better
than
riches
the
thing
that
matters
is
the
realisation
by
teachers
that
matter
more
than
results
opportunities
to
discover
to
learn
to
comprehend
all
sides
of
life
to
be
an
individual
to
appreciate
beauty
to
go
at
one
own
rate
some
are
material
in
their
nature
such
as
the
actual
surroundings
of
the
child
in
school
others
are
rather
in
the
atmosphere
such
as
refraining
from
interference
encouragement
suggestion
spirituality
the
teacher
has
the
making
of
opportunities
largely
in
her
own
hands
the
thing
that
matters
is
the
cultivation
of
the
divine
gift
of
imagination
both
morality
and
spirituality
spring
from
this
meanness
cowardice
lack
of
sympathy
sensuality
materialism
quickly
grow
where
there
is
no
imagination
it
refines
and
intensifies
personality
it
opens
a
door
to
things
beyond
the
senses
it
makes
possible
appreciation
of
the
things
of
the
spirit
and
appreciation
is
a
thousand
times
more
important
than
knowledge
the
thing
that
matters
is
the
need
for
freedom
from
bondage
of
the
body
and
of
the
soul
only
from
a
free
atmosphere
can
come
the
best
things
personality
imagination
and
opportunity
and
all
are
great
needs
but
the
greatest
of
all
is
freedom
