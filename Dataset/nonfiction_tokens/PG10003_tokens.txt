my
first
years
as
a
frenchwoman
i
when
macmahon
was
president
i
was
married
in
paris
in
november
at
the
french
protestant
chapel
of
the
rue
taitbout
by
monsieur
bersier
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
eloquent
pastors
of
the
protestant
church
we
had
just
established
ourselves
in
paris
after
having
lived
seven
years
in
rome
we
had
a
vague
idea
of
going
back
to
america
and
paris
seemed
a
first
step
in
that
direction
was
nearer
new
york
than
rome
i
knew
very
little
of
france
we
had
never
lived
there
merely
stayed
a
few
weeks
in
the
spring
and
autumn
coming
and
going
from
italy
my
husband
was
a
deputy
named
to
the
national
assembly
in
bordeaux
in
by
his
department
the
aisne
he
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
to
bordeaux
communications
and
transports
were
not
easy
as
the
germans
were
still
in
the
country
and
what
was
more
important
he
had
any
money
could
correspond
with
his
banker
in
paris
he
was
living
in
the
country
however
a
sufficient
amount
was
found
in
the
country
and
he
was
able
to
make
his
journey
when
i
married
the
assembly
was
sitting
at
versailles
monsieur
thiers
the
first
president
of
the
republic
had
been
overthrown
in
may
marshal
macmahon
named
in
his
place
had
had
a
short
ministry
public
instruction
under
monsieur
thiers
but
he
was
so
convinced
that
it
would
not
last
that
he
never
even
went
to
the
ministry
saw
his
directors
in
his
own
rooms
i
was
plunged
at
once
into
absolutely
new
surroundings
personal
friends
were
principally
orleanists
and
the
literary
element
of
paris
his
colleagues
at
the
institute
the
first
houses
i
was
taken
to
in
paris
were
the
ségurs
remusats
lasteyries
casimir
périers
gallieras
léon
say
and
some
of
the
protestant
families
pourtalès
andré
bartholdi
mallet
etc
it
was
such
an
entirely
different
world
from
any
i
had
been
accustomed
to
that
it
took
me
some
time
to
feel
at
home
in
my
new
milieu
political
feeling
was
very
strong
all
sorts
of
fresh
young
elements
coming
to
the
front
the
war
was
just
over
the
french
very
sore
and
bitter
after
their
defeat
there
was
a
strong
underlying
feeling
of
violent
animosity
to
the
emperor
who
had
lost
them
two
of
their
fairest
provinces
and
a
passionate
desire
for
the
revanche
the
feeling
was
very
bitter
between
the
two
branches
of
the
royalist
party
legitimists
and
orleanists
one
night
at
a
party
in
the
faubourg
germain
i
saw
a
fashionable
woman
of
the
extreme
legitimist
party
turn
her
back
on
the
comtesse
de
paris
the
receptions
and
visits
were
not
always
easy
nor
pleasant
even
though
i
was
a
stranger
and
had
no
ties
with
any
former
government
i
remember
one
of
my
first
visits
to
a
legitimist
countess
in
the
faubourg
germain
i
went
on
her
reception
day
a
thing
all
young
women
are
most
particular
about
in
paris
i
found
her
with
a
circle
of
ladies
sitting
around
her
none
of
whom
i
knew
they
were
all
very
civil
only
i
was
astonished
at
the
way
the
mistress
of
the
house
mentioned
my
name
every
time
she
spoke
to
me
madame
waddington
allée

madame

vous
montez
à

tous
les
matins
je
crois
monsieur
waddington

les
vendredis

me
semble
etc
i
was
rather
surprised
and
said
to
when
i
got
home
how
curious
it
is
that
way
of
saying
one
name
all
the
time
i
suppose
it
is
an
french
custom
madame
de
must
have
said
twenty
times
during
my
rather
short
visit
he
was
much
amused
do
you
know
why
so
that
all
the
people
might
know
who
you
were
and
not
say
awful
things
about
the
gouvernement
and
the
republic
no
gentleman
could
serve
footnote
here
and
throughout
this
book
refers
to
madame
waddington
husband
william
waddington
illustration
monsieur
theirs
the
position
of
the
german
embassy
in
paris
was
very
difficult
and
unfortunately
their
first
ambassador
after
the
war
count
arnim
understand
perhaps
did
care
to
how
difficult
it
was
for
a
nation
which
until
then
had
always
ranked
as
a
great
military
power
to
accept
her
humiliation
and
be
just
to
the
victorious
adversary
arnim
was
an
unfortunate
appointment
not
at
all
the
man
for
such
a
delicate
situation
we
had
known
him
in
rome
in
the
old
days
of
pio
nono
reign
where
he
had
a
great
position
as
prussian
minister
to
the
vatican
he
and
the
countess
arnim
received
a
great
deal
and
their
beautiful
rooms
in
the
palazzo
caffarelli
on
the
top
of
the
capitol
hill
the
two
great
statues
of
castor
and
pollux
standing
by
their
horses
looking
as
if
they
were
guarding
the
entrance
were
a
brilliant
centre
for
all
the
roman
and
diplomatic
world
he
was
a
thorough
man
of
the
world
could
make
himself
charming
when
he
chose
but
he
never
had
a
pleasant
manner
was
curt
arrogant
with
a
very
strong
sense
of
his
own
superiority
from
the
first
moment
he
came
to
paris
as
ambassador
he
put
people
backs
up
they
never
liked
him
never
trusted
him
whenever
he
had
an
unpleasant
communication
to
make
he
exaggerated
the
unpleasantness
never
attenuated
and
there
is
so
much
in
the
way
things
are
said
the
french
were
very
hard
upon
him
when
he
got
into
trouble
and
certainly
his
own
government
was
merciless
to
him
one
of
my
first
small
difficulties
after
becoming
a
frenchwoman
was
to
eliminate
some
of
my
german
friends
from
my
salon
i
could
not
run
the
risk
of
their
being
treated
rudely
i
remember
so
well
one
night
at
home
before
i
was
married
seeing
two
french
officers
not
in
uniform
slip
quietly
out
of
the
room
when
one
of
the
german
embassy
came
in
yet
ours
was
a
neutral
house
when
my
engagement
was
announced
one
of
my
great
friends
at
the
german
embassy
count
arco
said
to
me
this
is
the
end
i
suppose
of
our
friendship
i
can
never
go
to
see
you
when
you
are
the
wife
of
a
french
deputy
oh
yes
you
can
still
come
not
quite
so
often
perhaps
but
i
ca
give
up
my
friends
however
we
drifted
apart
without
knowing
why
exactly
it
is
curious
how
long
that
hostile
feeling
toward
germany
has
lasted
in
france
every
year
there
is
a
great
review
of
the
paris
garrison
thirty
thousand
men
by
the
president
of
the
republic
at
longchamp
on
the
of
july
the
national
fête
the
day
of
the
storming
of
the
bastile
it
is
a
great
day
in
paris
one
of
the
sights
of
the
year
and
falling
in
midsummer
the
day
is
generally
beautiful
and
very
warm
from
early
dawn
all
the
chairs
and
benches
along
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
are
crowded
with
people
waiting
patiently
for
hours
to
see
the
show
there
is
not
a
seat
to
be
had
at
longchamp
unless
one
arrives
very
early
the
tribunes
are
packed
and
the
president
box
very
crowded
as
he
invites
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
ministers
and
their
wives
on
that
day
the
troops
are
always
received
with
much
enthusiasm
particularly
the
artillery
dragging
their
light
and
passing
at
a
gallop
also
the
battalion
of
cyr
the
great
french
military
school
the
final
charge
of
the
cavalry
is
very
fine
masses
of
riders
come
thundering
over
the
plain
the
general
commanding
in
front
stopping
suddenly
as
if
moved
by
machinery
just
opposite
the
president
box
i
went
very
regularly
as
long
as
was
in
office
and
always
enjoyed
my
day
there
was
an
excellent
buffet
in
the
salon
behind
the
box
and
it
was
pleasant
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
rest
one
eyes
while
the
long
columns
of
infantry
were
passing
the
regular
continuous
movement
was
fatiguing
all
the
ambassadors
and
foreigners
were
very
keen
about
the
review
paying
great
attention
to
the
size
of
the
men
and
horses
and
their
general
equipment
as
long
as
marshal
macmahon
was
president
of
the
republic
he
always
rode
home
after
the
review
down
the
in
full
uniform
with
a
brilliant
staff
of
foreign
officers
and
military
attachés
it
was
a
pretty
sight
and
attracted
great
attention
some
of
the
foreign
uniforms
are
very
striking
and
the
french
love
a
military
show
illustration
marshal
macmahon
for
many
years
after
the
war
the
german
military
attaché
returned
from
the
review
unobserved
in
a
carriage
could
run
the
risk
of
an
angry
or
insulting
word
from
some
one
in
the
crowd
and
still
later
fifteen
years
after
the
war
when
was
ambassador
in
england
i
was
godmother
of
the
daughter
of
a
cousin
living
in
london
the
godfather
was
count
herbert
bismarck
son
of
the
famous
chancellor
at
the
time
of
the
christening
i
was
in
france
staying
with
some
friends
in
the
country
the
son
of
the
house
had
been
through
the
war
had
distinguished
himself
very
much
and
they
were
still
very
sore
over
their
reverses
and
the
necessity
of
submitting
to
all
the
little
which
came
at
intervals
from
germany
bismarck
sent
me
a
telegram
regretting
the
absence
of
the
godmother
from
the
ceremony
it
was
brought
to
me
just
after
breakfast
while
we
were
having
our
coffee
i
opened
it
and
read
it
out
explaining
that
it
was
from
bismarck
to
express
his
regret
for
my
absence
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
then
the
mistress
of
the
house
said
to
me
très
désagréable
pour
vous
chère
amie
cette
association
avec
bismarck
i
did
see
much
of
in
the
daytime
we
usually
rode
in
the
morning
in
the
bois
and
immediately
after
breakfast
he
started
for
versailles
in
the
parliamentary
train
dinner
was
always
a
doubtful
meal
sometimes
he
came
home
very
late
for
dinner
sometimes
he
dined
at
versailles
and
only
got
home
at
ten
or
eleven
if
the
sitting
was
stormy
the
hotel
des
reservoirs
did
a
flourishing
business
as
long
as
the
chambers
sat
at
versailles
when
we
were
dining
out
it
was
very
disagreeable
particularly
the
first
winter
when
i
did
know
many
people
i
remember
one
dinner
at
the
countess
duchatel
where
i
went
alone
we
were
ten
women
and
five
men
all
the
rest
were
deputies
who
had
telegraphed
at
the
last
moment
they
would
not
come
were
kept
at
versailles
by
an
important
question
one
of
the
most
interesting
things
i
saw
in
just
before
my
marriage
was
the
of
marshal
bazaine
for
treachery
at
metz
giving
up
his
army
and
the
city
without
any
attempt
to
break
through
the
enemy
lines
or
in
fact
any
resistance
of
any
kind
the
court
was
held
at
the
grand
trianon
versailles
a
place
so
associated
with
a
court
and
the
fanciful
devices
of
a
gay
young
queen
that
it
was
difficult
to
realise
the
drama
that
was
being
enacted
when
the
honour
of
a
marshal
of
france
almost
an
army
of
france
was
to
be
judged
it
was
an
impressive
scene
the
hall
packed
and
people
at
all
the
doors
and
entrances
clamouring
for
seats
the
public
was
curious
a
little
of
everything
members
of
the
national
assembly
officers
all
in
uniform
pretty
women
of
all
categories
the
group
of
journalists
with
keen
eager
faces
watching
every
change
of
expression
of
the
marshal
face
some
faces
wives
of
members
or
leading
political
and
literary
men
a
fair
amount
of
the
frailer
sisterhood
actresses
and
making
a
great
effect
of
waving
plumes
and
diamonds
the
court
was
presided
over
by
the
duc
who
accepted
the
office
after
much
hesitation
he
was
a
fine
soldierly
figure
as
he
came
in
in
full
uniform
a
group
of
officers
behind
him
all
with
stern
set
faces
the
impression
of
the
public
was
generally
hostile
to
the
marshal
one
felt
it
all
through
the
trial
he
was
dressed
in
full
uniform
with
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
of
honour
it
was
melancholy
to
hear
the
report
of
his
career
when
it
was
read
by
his
counsel
long
years
of
active
service
many
wounds
often
mentioned
for
brave
conduct
under
fire
having
the
médaille
militaire
the
grand
cordon
of
the
legion
the
baton
de
maréchal
de
france
all
the
honours
his
country
could
give
him
to
end
so
miserably
judged
not
only
by
the
court
but
by
the
country
as
a
traitor
false
to
his
trust
when
his
country
was
in
the
of
defeat
and
humiliation
his
attitude
at
the
trial
was
curious
he
sat
very
still
in
his
armchair
looking
straight
before
him
only
raising
his
head
and
looking
at
the
duc
when
some
grave
accusation
was
made
against
him
his
explanation
brought
the
famous
reply
from
the
duc
when
he
said
it
was
impossible
to
act
or
to
treat
there
was
nothing
left
in
france
no
government
no
orders
nothing
the
due
answered
il
y
avait
toujours
la
france
he
did
look
overwhelmed
rather
like
some
one
who
was
detached
from
the
whole
proceedings
i
saw
his
face
quite
well
it
was
neither
false
nor
weak
ordinary
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
a
french
general
with
a
brilliant
record
behind
him
should
have
been
guilty
of
such
treachery
sacrificing
his
men
and
his
honour
his
friends
they
were
not
many
say
he
lost
his
head
was
nearly
crazy
with
the
utterly
unforeseen
defeat
of
the
french
but
even
a
moment
of
insanity
would
hardly
account
for
such
extraordinary
weakness
and
some
of
his
friends
were
discussing
it
in
the
train
coming
home
they
were
all
convinced
of
his
guilt
had
no
doubt
as
to
what
the
sentence
of
the
court
would
be
death
and
degradation
but
thought
that
physical
fatigue
and
great
depression
must
have
caused
a
general
breakdown
the
end
every
one
knows
he
was
condemned
to
be
shot
and
degraded
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
was
cancelled
on
account
of
his
former
services
but
he
was
degraded
imprisoned
escaped
and
finished
his
life
in
spain
in
poverty
and
obscurity
deserted
by
all
his
friends
and
his
wife
it
was
a
melancholy
rentrée
for
the
duc
his
thoughts
must
have
gone
back
to
the
days
when
the
gallant
young
officer
fils
de
france
won
his
first
military
glory
in
algiers
and
thought
the
world
was
at
his
feet
his
brilliant
exploit
capturing
the
smala
of
has
been
immortalised
by
vernet
in
the
great
historical
picture
that
one
sees
at
versailles
there
are
always
artists
copying
parts
of
it
particularly
one
group
where
a
lovely
woman
is
falling
out
of
a
litter
backward
even
now
when
one
thinks
of
the
king
louis
philippe
with
all
his
tall
strong
young
sons
there
is
a
picture
of
the
king
on
horseback
with
all
his
sons
around
him
splendid
specimens
of
young
manhood
it
seems
incredible
that
they
are
not
still
ruling
and
reigning
at
the
tuileries
i
wonder
if
things
would
have
been
very
different
if
louis
philippe
and
his
family
had
not
walked
out
of
the
tuileries
that
day
i
often
asked
in
what
way
france
had
gained
by
being
a
republic
i
personally
was
quite
impartial
being
born
an
american
and
never
having
lived
in
france
until
after
the
war
i
had
no
particular
ties
nor
traditions
had
no
grandfather
killed
on
the
scaffold
nor
frozen
to
death
in
the
retreat
of
la
grande
armée
from
moscow
they
always
told
me
a
republic
was
in
the
air
young
talents
and
energy
must
come
to
the
front
the
people
must
have
a
voice
in
the
government
i
think
the
average
frenchman
is
intelligent
but
i
do
think
the
vote
of
the
man
in
the
street
can
have
as
much
value
as
that
of
a
man
who
has
had
not
only
a
good
education
but
who
has
been
accustomed
always
to
hear
certain
principles
of
law
and
order
held
up
as
rules
for
the
guidance
of
his
own
life
as
well
as
other
people
certainly
universal
suffrage
was
a
most
unfortunate
measure
to
take
from
america
and
apply
to
france
but
it
has
been
taken
and
now
must
stay
i
have
often
heard
political
men
who
deplored
and
condemned
the
law
say
that
no
minister
would
dare
to
propose
a
change
i
went
often
to
the
chamber
in
the
spring
used
to
drive
out
and
bring
home
versailles
was
very
animated
and
interesting
during
all
that
time
so
many
people
always
about
quite
a
number
of
women
followed
the
debates
one
met
plenty
of
people
one
knew
in
the
streets
at
the
patissiers
or
at
some
of
the
shops
where
there
were
still
bargains
to
be
found
in
very
old
furniture
prints
and
china
there
is
a
large
garrison
there
were
always
officers
riding
squads
of
soldiers
moving
about
in
all
directions
and
continuous
arrivals
at
the
station
of
deputies
and
journalists
hurrying
to
the
palace
their
black
portfolios
under
their
arms
the
palace
was
cold
there
was
a
fine
draught
at
the
entrance
and
the
big
stone
staircase
was
always
cold
even
in
june
but
the
was
warm
enough
and
always
crowded
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
seats
people
were
so
interested
in
those
first
debates
after
the
war
when
everything
had
to
be
reorganised
and
so
much
of
the
past
was
being
swept
away
ii
impressions
of
the
assembly
at
versailles
the
sittings
of
the
assembly
were
very
interesting
in
that
wonderful
year
when
everything
was
being
discussed
all
public
interest
of
course
was
centred
in
versailles
where
the
national
assembly
was
trying
to
establish
some
sort
of
stable
government
there
were
endless
discussions
and
speeches
and
very
violent
language
in
the
chambers
gambetta
made
some
bitter
attacks
on
the
royalists
accusing
them
of
mauvaise
foi
and
want
of
patriotism
the
bonapartist
leaders
tried
to
persuade
themselves
and
their
friends
that
they
still
had
a
hold
on
the
country
and
that
a
plébiscite
would
bring
back
in
triumph
their
prince
the
legitimists
hoping
against
hope
that
the
comte
de
chambord
would
still
be
the
saviour
of
the
country
made
passionate
appeals
to
the
old
feeling
of
loyalty
in
the
nation
and
the
centre
droit
representing
the
orleanists
nervous
hesitating
knowing
the
position
perfectly
ardently
desiring
a
constitutional
monarchy
but
feeling
that
it
was
not
possible
at
that
moment
yet
unwilling
to
commit
themselves
to
a
final
declaration
of
the
republic
which
would
make
a
royalist
restoration
impossible
all
the
left
confident
determined
the
republic
was
voted
on
the
of
january
by
a
majority
of
one
vote
if
majority
it
could
be
called
but
the
great
step
had
been
taken
and
the
struggle
began
instantly
between
the
moderate
conservative
republicans
and
the
more
advanced
left
came
home
late
that
day
some
of
his
friends
came
in
after
dinner
and
the
talk
was
most
interesting
i
was
so
new
to
it
all
that
most
of
the
names
of
the
rank
and
file
were
unknown
to
me
and
the
appreciations
of
the
votes
and
the
anecdotes
and
on
the
voters
said
nothing
to
me
looking
back
after
all
these
years
it
seems
to
me
that
the
moderate
royalists
centre
droit
threw
away
a
splendid
chance
they
could
not
stop
the
republican
wave
nothing
could
but
they
might
have
controlled
it
and
directed
it
instead
of
standing
aloof
and
throwing
the
power
into
the
hands
of
the
left
we
heard
the
sayings
very
often
those
days
la
république
sera
conservatrice
ou
elle
ne
sera
pas
and
la
république
sans
républicains
attributed
to
thiers
and
marshal
macmahon
the
national
assembly
struggled
on
to
the
end
of
the
year
making
a
constitution
a
parliament
with
two
houses
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
with
many
discussions
and
contradictions
and
hopes
and
illusions
illustration
sitting
of
the
national
assembly
at
the
palace
of
versailles
from
march
i
went
often
to
versailles
driving
out
when
the
weather
was
fine
i
liked
the
stormy
sittings
best
some
orator
would
say
something
that
displeased
the
public
and
in
a
moment
there
would
be
the
greatest
uproar
protestations
and
accusations
from
all
sides
some
of
the
extreme
left
getting
up
gesticulating
wildly
and
shaking
their
fists
at
the
speaker
the
right
generally
calm
and
sarcastic
requesting
the
speaker
to
repeat
his
monstrous
statements
the
huissiers
dressed
in
black
with
silver
chains
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
tribune
calling
out
at
intervals
silence
messieurs
vous
plaît
the
president
ringing
his
bell
violently
to
call
the
house
to
order
and
nobody
paying
the
slightest
attention
the
orator
sometimes
standing
quite
still
with
folded
arms
waiting
until
the
storm
should
abate
sometimes
dominating
the
hall
and
hurling
abuse
at
his
adversaries
was
always
perfectly
quiet
his
voice
was
low
not
very
strong
and
he
could
not
speak
if
there
were
an
uproar
when
he
was
interrupted
in
a
speech
he
used
to
stand
perfectly
still
with
folded
arms
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
silence
the
deputies
would
call
out
allez
allez
interspersed
with
a
few
lively
criticisms
on
what
he
was
saying
to
them
he
was
perfectly
unmoved
merely
replied
i
will
go
on
with
pleasure
as
soon
as
you
will
be
quiet
enough
for
me
to
be
heard
frenchmen
generally
have
such
a
wonderful
facility
of
speech
and
such
a
pitiless
logic
in
discussing
a
question
that
the
debates
were
often
very
interesting
the
public
was
interesting
too
a
great
many
women
of
all
classes
followed
the
sittings
several
egerias
not
generally
in
their
first
youth
of
political
men
sitting
prominently
in
the
president
box
or
in
the
front
row
of
the
journalists
box
following
the
discussions
with
great
interest
and
sending
down
little
slips
of
paper
to
their
friends
below
members
wives
and
friends
who
enjoyed
spending
an
hour
or
two
listening
to
the
speeches
newspaper
correspondents
literary
ladies
diplomatists
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
places
particularly
when
some
orators
were
announced
to
speak
upon
an
important
question
we
did
always
know
beforehand
and
i
remember
some
dull
afternoons
with
one
or
two
members
making
long
speeches
about
purely
local
matters
which
did
interest
any
one
we
looked
down
upon
an
almost
empty
hall
on
those
occasions
a
great
many
of
the
members
had
gone
out
and
were
talking
in
the
lobbies
those
who
remained
were
talking
in
groups
writing
letters
walking
about
the
hall
quite
unconscious
apparently
of
the
speaker
at
the
tribune
i
could
understand
how
the
man
could
go
on
talking
to
empty
benches
but
told
me
he
was
quite
indifferent
to
the
attention
of
his
colleagues
his
speech
was
for
his
electors
and
would
appear
the
next
day
in
the
i
remember
one
man
talked
for
hours
about
allumettes
chimiques
léon
say
was
a
delightful
speaker
so
easy
always
finding
exactly
the
word
he
wanted
it
hardly
seemed
a
speech
when
he
was
at
the
tribune
more
like
a
causerie
though
he
told
very
plain
truths
sometimes
to
the
peuple
souverain
he
was
essentially
french
or
rather
parisian
knew
everybody
and
was
au
courant
of
all
that
went
on
politically
and
socially
and
had
a
certain
blague
that
eminently
french
quality
which
is
very
difficult
to
explain
he
was
a
hard
worker
and
told
me
once
that
what
rested
him
most
after
a
long
day
was
to
go
to
a
small
boulevard
theatre
or
to
read
a
rather
lively
yellowbacked
novel
i
never
heard
gambetta
speak
which
i
always
regretted
in
fact
knew
very
little
of
him
he
was
not
a
ladies
man
though
he
had
some
devoted
women
friends
and
was
always
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
political
men
whenever
he
appeared
in
public
in
all
french
parties
immediately
after
dinner
the
men
all
congregate
together
to
talk
to
each
other
never
to
the
women
so
unless
you
happen
to
find
yourself
seated
next
to
some
man
you
never
really
have
a
chance
of
talking
to
him
gambetta
did
go
out
much
and
as
by
some
curious
chance
he
was
never
next
to
me
at
dinner
i
never
had
any
opportunity
of
talking
to
him
he
was
not
one
of
friends
nor
an
habitué
of
the
house
his
appearance
was
against
him
dark
with
an
enormous
head
when
i
had
had
enough
of
the
speeches
and
the
bad
atmosphere
i
used
to
wander
about
the
terraces
and
gardens
how
many
beautiful
sunsets
i
have
seen
from
the
top
of
the
terrace
or
else
standing
on
the
three
famous
pink
marble
steps
so
well
known
to
all
lovers
of
poetry
through
alfred
de
musset
beautiful
verses
trois
marches
roses
seeing
in
imagination
all
the
brilliant
crowd
of
courtiers
and
fair
women
that
used
to
people
those
wonderful
gardens
in
the
old
days
of
versailles
i
went
sometimes
to
the
reservoirs
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
very
often
found
other
women
who
had
also
driven
out
to
get
their
husbands
we
occasionally
brought
back
friends
who
preferred
the
quiet
cool
drive
through
the
park
of
st
cloud
to
the
crowd
and
dust
of
the
railway
the
count
de
vallier
who
was
not
yet
senator
but
deeply
interested
in
politics
was
frequently
at
versailles
and
came
back
with
us
often
he
was
a
charming
easy
talker
i
never
tired
of
hearing
about
the
brilliant
days
of
the
last
empire
and
the
fêtes
at
the
tuileries
compiègne
and
st
cloud
he
had
been
a
great
deal
at
the
court
of
napoleon
iii
had
seen
many
interesting
people
of
all
kinds
and
had
a
wonderful
memory
he
must
have
had
an
inner
sense
or
presentiment
of
some
kind
about
the
future
for
i
have
heard
him
say
often
in
speaking
of
the
old
days
and
the
glories
of
the
empire
when
everything
seemed
so
prosperous
and
brilliant
that
he
used
often
to
ask
himself
if
it
could
be
real
were
the
foundations
as
solid
as
they
seemed
he
had
been
a
diplomatist
was
in
germany
at
the
time
of
the
war
and
like
so
many
of
his
colleagues
scattered
over
germany
was
quite
aware
of
the
growing
hostile
feeling
in
germany
to
france
and
also
of
bismarck
aims
and
ambitions
he
like
so
many
others
wrote
repeated
letters
and
warnings
to
the
french
foreign
office
which
apparently
had
no
effect
one
heard
afterward
that
several
letters
of
that
description
from
french
diplomatists
in
germany
were
found
unopened
in
a
drawer
at
the
ministry
it
was
rather
sad
as
we
drove
through
the
stately
alleys
of
the
park
of
st
cloud
with
the
setting
sun
shining
through
the
fine
old
trees
to
hear
of
all
the
fêtes
that
used
to
take
place
there
and
one
could
quite
well
fancy
the
beautiful
empress
appearing
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
long
avenues
followed
by
a
brilliant
suite
of
ladies
and
écuyers
and
the
echoes
of
the
cor
de
chasse
in
the
distance
the
alleys
are
always
there
and
fairly
well
kept
but
very
few
people
or
carriages
pass
the
park
is
deserted
i
do
think
the
cor
de
chasse
would
awaken
an
echo
or
a
regret
even
so
entirely
has
the
empire
and
its
glories
become
a
thing
of
the
past
a
rendezvous
de
chasse
was
a
very
pretty
sight
we
went
once
to
compiègne
before
i
was
married
about
three
years
before
the
war
we
went
out
and
breakfasted
at
compiègne
with
a
great
friend
of
ours
de
a
chamberlain
or
equerry
of
the
emperor
we
breakfasted
in
a
funny
little
hotel
with
a
very
good
cuisine
and
drove
in
a
big
open
break
to
the
forest
there
were
a
great
many
people
riding
driving
and
walking
officers
of
the
garrison
in
uniform
members
of
the
hunt
in
green
and
gold
and
a
fair
sprinkling
of
red
coats
the
empress
looked
charming
dressed
always
in
the
uniform
of
the
hunt
green
with
gold
braid
and
a
tricorne
on
her
head
all
her
ladies
with
the
same
dress
which
was
very
becoming
one
of
the
most
of
her
ladies
was
the
princess
anna
murat
the
present
duchesse
de
mouchy
who
looked
very
handsome
in
the
tricorne
and
beautifully
fitting
habit
i
did
see
the
empress
on
her
horse
as
we
lost
sight
of
them
very
soon
she
and
her
ladies
arrived
on
the
field
in
an
open
break
i
saw
the
emperor
quite
distinctly
as
he
rode
up
and
gave
some
orders
he
was
very
well
mounted
there
were
some
beautiful
horses
but
stooped
slightly
and
had
rather
a
sad
face
i
never
saw
him
again
and
the
empress
only
long
years
after
at
cowes
when
everything
had
gone
out
of
her
life
the
president
marshal
macmahon
was
living
at
the
préfecture
at
versailles
and
received
every
thursday
evening
we
went
there
several
times
it
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
official
world
the
first
two
or
three
times
we
drove
out
but
it
was
long
quite
an
hour
and
a
quarter
over
bad
roads
a
good
deal
of
pavement
one
did
care
to
drive
through
the
park
of
st
cloud
at
night
it
was
very
lonely
and
dark
we
should
have
been
quite
helpless
if
we
had
fallen
upon
any
enterprising
tramps
who
could
easily
have
stopped
the
carriage
and
helped
themselves
to
any
money
or
jewels
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
one
evening
the
seine
had
overflowed
and
we
were
obliged
to
walk
a
long
distance
all
around
sèvres
and
got
to
versailles
very
late
and
quite
exhausted
with
the
jolting
and
general
discomfort
after
that
we
went
out
by
train
which
put
us
at
the
préfecture
at
ten
it
very
convenient
as
there
was
a
great
rush
for
carriages
when
we
arrived
at
versailles
still
everybody
did
it
we
generally
wore
black
or
dark
dresses
with
a
lace
veil
tied
over
our
heads
and
of
course
only
went
when
it
was
fine
the
evening
was
pleasant
enough
one
saw
all
the
political
men
the
marshal
personal
friends
of
the
droite
went
to
him
in
the
first
days
of
his
presidency
they
rather
fell
off
later
the
government
and
republicans
naturally
and
all
the
diplomatic
corps
there
were
not
many
women
as
it
really
was
rather
an
effort
to
put
one
self
into
a
dress
and
start
off
directly
after
dinner
to
the
gare
lazare
and
have
rather
a
rush
for
places
we
were
always
late
and
just
had
time
to
scramble
into
the
last
carriage
i
felt
very
strange
an
outsider
all
the
first
months
but
my
friends
were
very
nice
to
me
and
after
a
certain
time
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
politics
interested
me
i
learned
a
great
deal
from
merely
listening
while
the
men
talked
at
dinner
i
suppose
i
should
have
understood
much
more
if
i
had
read
the
papers
regularly
but
i
begin
to
do
that
until
had
been
minister
for
some
time
and
then
worked
myself
into
a
nervous
fever
at
all
the
opposition
papers
said
about
him
however
all
told
the
attacks
were
never
very
vicious
he
had
never
been
in
public
life
until
after
the
war
when
he
was
named
deputy
and
joined
the
assemblée
nationale
at
bordeaux
which
was
an
immense
advantage
to
him
he
had
never
served
any
other
government
and
was
therefore
perfectly
independent
and
was
bound
by
no
family
traditions
or
old
friendships
did
mind
the
opposition
papers
at
all
not
even
the
caricatures
some
of
them
were
very
funny
there
was
one
very
like
him
sitting
quite
straight
and
correct
on
the
box
of
a
brougham
john
cocher
anglais
jamais
versé
ni
accroché
english
coachman
who
has
never
upset
nor
run
into
anything
there
were
a
few
political
salons
the
countess
de
received
every
evening
but
only
men
no
women
were
ever
asked
the
wives
rather
demurred
at
first
but
the
men
went
all
the
same
as
one
saw
every
one
there
and
heard
all
the
latest
political
gossip
another
hostess
was
the
princess
lize
troubetskoi
she
was
a
great
friend
and
admirer
of
thiers
was
supposed
to
give
him
a
great
deal
of
information
from
foreign
governments
she
was
very
eclectic
in
her
sympathies
and
every
one
went
to
her
not
only
french
but
all
foreigners
of
any
distinction
who
passed
through
paris
she
gave
herself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
her
friends
but
also
used
them
when
she
wanted
anything
one
of
the
stories
which
was
always
told
of
the
foreign
office
was
her
petit
paquet
which
she
wanted
to
send
by
the
valise
to
berlin
when
the
comte
de
vallier
was
french
ambassador
there
he
agreed
willingly
to
receive
the
package
addressed
to
him
which
proved
to
be
a
grand
piano
the
privilege
of
sending
packages
abroad
by
the
valise
of
the
foreign
affairs
was
greatly
abused
when
became
minister
of
foreign
affairs
he
made
various
changes
one
of
which
was
that
the
valise
should
be
absolutely
restricted
to
official
papers
and
documents
which
really
was
perhaps
well
observed
the
countess
de
ségur
received
every
saturday
night
it
was
really
an
orleanist
salon
as
they
were
devoted
friends
of
the
orléans
family
but
one
saw
all
the
moderate
republicans
there
and
the
centre
gauche
which
struggled
so
long
to
keep
together
and
be
a
moderating
influence
but
has
long
been
swallowed
up
in
the
flood
of
radicalism
and
a
great
many
literary
men
members
of
the
institute
academicians
etc
they
had
a
fine
old
house
entre
cour
et
jardin
with
all
sorts
of
interesting
pictures
and
souvenirs
countess
de
also
received
every
day
before
three
i
often
went
and
was
delighted
when
i
could
find
her
alone
she
was
very
clever
very
original
had
known
all
sorts
of
people
and
it
was
most
interesting
to
hear
her
talk
about
king
louis
philippe
court
the
spanish
marriages
the
death
of
the
duc
the
coup
of
louis
napoléon
etc
when
she
first
began
to
receive
during
the
reign
of
louis
philippe
the
feeling
was
very
bitter
between
the
legitimists
extreme
royalist
party
and
the
orleanists
the
duc
often
came
to
them
on
saturday
evenings
and
always
in
a
good
deal
of
state
with
handsome
carriage
etc
she
warned
her
legitimist
friends
when
she
knew
he
was
coming
but
she
always
know
and
said
she
never
had
any
trouble
or
disagreeable
scenes
every
one
was
perfectly
respectful
to
the
duke
but
the
extreme
legitimists
went
away
at
once
we
went
quite
often
to
monsieur
and
madame
thiers
who
received
every
evening
in
their
big
gloomy
house
in
the
place
georges
it
was
a
political
centre
all
the
republican
party
went
there
and
many
of
his
old
friends
orleanists
who
admired
his
great
intelligence
while
disapproving
his
politics
literary
men
journalists
all
the
diplomatists
and
distinguished
strangers
he
had
people
at
dinner
every
night
and
a
small
reception
afterward
madame
thiers
and
her
sister
mademoiselle
dosne
doing
the
honours
for
him
i
believe
both
ladies
were
very
intelligent
but
i
ca
truthfully
say
they
had
any
charm
of
manner
they
never
looked
pleased
to
see
any
one
and
each
took
comfortable
little
naps
in
their
armchairs
after
dinner
the
first
comers
had
sometimes
rather
embarrassing
entrances
but
i
am
told
they
held
very
much
to
their
receptions
thiers
was
wonderful
he
was
a
very
old
man
when
i
knew
him
but
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
keen
his
voice
strong
and
he
would
talk
all
the
evening
without
any
appearance
of
fatigue
he
slept
every
afternoon
for
two
hours
and
was
quite
rested
and
alert
by
dinner
time
it
was
an
interesting
group
of
men
that
stood
around
the
little
figure
in
the
after
dinner
he
himself
stood
almost
always
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
prince
orloff
russian
ambassador
was
one
of
the
habitués
of
the
salon
and
i
was
always
delighted
when
he
would
slip
away
from
the
group
of
men
and
join
the
ladies
in
madame
thiers
salon
which
was
less
interesting
he
knew
everybody
french
and
foreign
and
gave
me
most
amusing
and
useful
little
sketches
of
all
the
celebrities
it
was
he
who
told
me
of
old
prince
gortschakoff
famous
phrase
when
he
heard
of
thiers
death
he
died
at
germain
in
encore
une
lumière
éteinte
quand
il
y
en
a
si
peu
qui
voient
clair
still
another
light
extinguished
when
there
are
so
few
who
see
clearly
many
have
gone
of
that
group
casimir
périer
léon
say
jules
ferry
vallier
comte
paul
de
ségur
barthélemy
hilaire
but
others
remain
younger
men
who
were
then
beginning
their
political
careers
and
were
eager
to
drink
in
lessons
and
warnings
from
the
old
statesman
who
fought
gallantly
to
the
last
i
found
the
first
winter
in
paris
as
the
wife
of
a
french
deputy
rather
trying
so
different
from
the
easy
pleasant
life
in
rome
that
has
changed
too
of
course
with
united
italy
and
rome
the
capital
but
it
was
a
small
rome
in
our
days
most
informal
i
do
ever
remember
having
written
an
invitation
all
the
years
we
lived
in
rome
everybody
led
the
same
life
and
we
saw
each
other
all
day
hunting
riding
driving
in
the
villas
in
the
afternoon
generally
finishing
at
the
pincio
where
there
was
music
all
the
carriages
drew
up
and
the
young
men
came
and
talked
to
the
women
exactly
as
if
they
were
at
the
opera
or
in
a
ballroom
when
we
had
music
or
danced
at
our
house
we
used
to
tell
some
man
to
say
on
danse
chez
madame
king
ce
soir
that
was
all
paris
society
is
much
stiffer
attaches
much
more
importance
to
visits
and
reception
days
there
is
very
little
informal
receiving
no
more
evenings
with
no
amusement
of
any
kind
provided
and
a
small
table
at
one
end
of
the
room
with
orangeade
and
cakes
which
i
remember
when
i
was
first
married
and
always
in
lent
the
quartet
of
the
conservatoire
playing
classical
symphonies
which
of
course
put
a
stop
to
all
conversation
as
people
listened
to
the
artists
of
the
conservatoire
in
a
sort
of
sacred
silence
now
one
is
invited
each
time
there
is
always
music
or
a
comédie
sometimes
a
conference
in
lent
and
a
buffet
in
the
there
is
much
more
luxury
and
women
wear
more
jewels
there
were
not
many
tiaras
when
i
first
knew
paris
society
now
every
young
woman
has
one
in
her
corbeille
illustration
the
foyer
of
the
opéra
one
of
the
first
big
things
i
saw
in
paris
was
the
opening
of
the
grand
opera
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
house
crowded
with
women
beautifully
dressed
and
wearing
fine
jewels
which
showed
very
little
the
decoration
of
the
house
being
very
elaborate
there
was
so
much
light
and
gilding
that
the
diamonds
were
quite
lost
the
two
great
features
of
the
evening
were
the
young
king
of
spain
the
father
of
the
present
king
a
slight
dark
youthful
figure
and
the
lord
mayor
of
london
who
really
made
much
more
effect
than
the
king
he
was
dressed
in
his
official
robes
had
two
sheriffs
and
a
macebearer
and
when
he
stood
at
the
top
of
the
grand
staircase
he
was
an
imposing
figure
and
the
public
was
delighted
with
him
he
was
surrounded
by
an
admiring
crowd
when
he
walked
in
the
foyer
everybody
was
there
and
pointed
out
to
me
the
celebrities
of
all
the
coteries
we
had
a
box
at
the
opera
and
went
very
regularly
the
opera
was
never
good
never
has
been
since
i
have
known
it
but
as
it
is
open
all
the
year
round
one
can
not
expect
to
have
the
stars
one
hears
elsewhere
still
it
is
always
a
pleasant
evening
one
sees
plenty
of
people
to
talk
to
and
the
music
is
a
cheerful
accompaniment
to
conversation
it
is
astounding
how
they
talk
in
the
boxes
and
how
the
public
submits
the
ballet
is
always
good
halanzier
was
director
of
the
grand
opera
and
we
went
sometimes
to
his
box
behind
the
scenes
which
was
most
amusing
he
was
most
dictatorial
occupied
himself
with
every
detail
was
consequently
an
excellent
director
i
remember
seeing
him
inspect
the
corps
de
ballet
one
night
just
before
the
curtain
went
up
he
passed
down
the
line
like
a
general
reviewing
his
troops
tapping
lightly
with
a
cane
various
arms
and
legs
which
were
not
in
position
he
was
perfectly
smiling
and
voyons
voyons
mes
petites
ce
pas
cela
but
saw
everything
what
liked
best
was
the
théâtre
français
we
had
a
box
there
but
as
so
many
of
our
friends
had
we
went
very
often
tuesday
was
the
fashionable
night
and
the
salle
was
almost
as
interesting
as
the
stage
particularly
if
it
happened
to
be
a
première
and
all
the
critics
and
journalists
were
there
sarah
bernhardt
and
croizette
were
both
playing
those
first
years
they
were
great
rivals
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
them
in
the
same
play
both
such
fine
talents
yet
so
totally
different
iii
waddington
as
minister
of
public
instruction
in
march
was
made
for
the
second
time
ministre
de
publique
et
des
beaux
arts
with
dufaure
président
du
conseil
duc
décazes
at
the
foreign
office
and
léon
say
at
the
finances
his
nomination
was
a
surprise
to
us
we
did
expect
it
at
all
there
had
been
so
many
discussions
so
many
names
put
forward
it
seemed
impossible
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
form
a
cabinet
which
would
be
equally
acceptable
to
the
marshal
and
to
the
chambers
i
came
in
rather
late
one
afternoon
while
the
negotiations
were
going
on
and
was
told
by
the
servants
that
léon
say
was
waiting
in
library
to
see
him
came
a
few
minutes
afterward
and
the
two
gentlemen
remained
a
long
time
talking
they
stopped
in
the
on
their
way
to
the
door
and
say
said
to
me
eh
bien
madame
je
vous
apporte
une
portefeuille
et
des
félicitations
before
i
accept
the
felicitations
i
would
like
to
know
which
portfolio
of
course
when
he
said
public
instruction
i
was
pleased
as
i
knew
it
was
the
only
one
cared
for
my
richard
waddington
senator
of
the
seine
inférieure
and
one
or
two
friends
came
to
see
us
in
the
evening
and
the
gentlemen
talked
late
into
the
night
discussing
programmes
possibilities
etc
all
the
next
day
the
conferences
went
on
and
when
the
new
cabinet
was
presented
to
the
marshal
he
received
them
graciously
if
not
warmly
said
both
dufaure
and
décazes
were
quite
wonderful
realising
the
state
of
affairs
exactly
and
knowing
the
temper
of
the
house
which
was
getting
more
advanced
every
day
and
more
difficult
to
manage
footnote
my
richard
waddington
senator
died
in
june
some
time
after
these
notes
were
written
at
once
convoked
all
the
officials
and
staff
of
the
ministry
he
made
very
few
changes
merely
taking
the
young
count
de
lasteyrie
now
marquis
de
lasteyrie
grandnephew
of
the
marquis
de
lafayette
son
of
jules
de
lasteyrie
a
senator
and
devoted
friend
of
the
orléans
family
as
his
chef
de
cabinet
two
or
three
days
after
the
new
cabinet
was
announced
took
me
to
the
elysée
to
pay
my
official
visit
to
the
maréchale
de
macmahon
she
received
us
in
a
pretty
salon
looking
out
on
the
garden
she
was
very
civil
not
a
particularly
gracious
manner
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
very
energetic
practical
woman
what
most
frenchwomen
are
i
was
very
much
struck
with
her
which
looked
most
businesslike
it
was
covered
with
quantities
of
letters
papers
cards
circulars
of
all
kinds
she
attended
to
all
household
matters
herself
i
always
heard
though
she
did
not
tell
me
that
she
read
every
letter
that
was
addressed
to
her
and
she
must
have
had
hundreds
of
begging
letters
she
was
very
charitable
much
interested
in
all
good
works
and
very
kind
to
all
artists
whenever
a
letter
came
asking
for
money
she
had
the
case
investigated
and
if
the
story
was
true
gave
practical
help
at
once
i
was
dismayed
at
first
with
the
number
of
letters
received
from
all
over
france
asking
my
intercession
with
the
minister
on
every
possible
subject
from
a
monument
historique
to
be
restored
to
a
pension
given
to
an
old
schoolmaster
no
longer
able
to
work
with
a
large
family
to
support
it
was
perfectly
impossible
for
me
to
answer
them
being
a
foreigner
and
never
having
lived
in
france
i
did
really
know
anything
about
the
various
questions
was
too
busy
to
attend
to
such
small
matters
so
i
consulted
de
chef
de
cabinet
and
we
agreed
that
i
should
send
all
the
correspondence
which
was
not
strictly
personal
to
him
and
he
would
have
it
examined
in
the
bureau
the
first
few
weeks
of
ministry
were
very
trying
to
me
i
went
to
see
so
many
people
so
many
people
came
to
see
me
all
strangers
with
whom
i
had
nothing
in
common
such
dreary
conversations
never
getting
beyond
the
most
ordinary
commonplace
phrases
such
an
absolutely
different
world
from
any
i
had
ever
lived
in
it
is
very
difficult
at
first
for
any
woman
who
marries
a
foreigner
to
make
her
life
in
her
new
country
there
must
be
so
many
things
that
are
different
better
perhaps
sometimes
but
not
what
one
has
been
accustomed
to
and
i
think
more
difficult
in
france
than
in
any
other
country
french
people
are
set
in
their
ways
and
there
is
so
little
sympathy
with
anything
that
is
not
french
i
was
struck
with
that
absence
of
sympathy
at
some
of
the
first
dinners
i
went
to
the
talk
was
exclusively
french
almost
parisian
very
personal
with
stories
and
allusions
to
people
and
things
i
knew
nothing
about
no
one
dreamed
of
talking
to
me
about
my
past
life
or
america
or
any
of
my
early
associations
yet
i
was
a
stranger
one
would
have
thought
they
might
have
taken
a
little
more
trouble
to
find
some
topics
of
general
interest
even
now
after
all
these
years
the
difference
of
nationality
counts
sometimes
when
i
am
discussing
with
very
intimate
friends
some
question
and
i
find
that
i
can
not
understand
their
views
and
they
can
not
understand
mine
they
always
come
back
to
the
real
difficulty
ecoutez
chère
amie
vous
êtes
autre
race
i
rather
complained
to
after
the
first
three
or
four
dinners
it
seemed
to
me
bad
manners
but
he
said
no
i
was
the
wife
of
a
french
political
man
and
every
one
took
for
granted
i
was
interested
in
the
conversation
certainly
no
one
intended
any
rudeness
the
first
big
dinner
i
went
to
that
year
was
at
the
elysée
the
regular
official
dinner
for
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
government
i
had
baron
von
zuylen
the
dutch
minister

of
our
great
friends

préfet
de
police
on
the
other
léon
renault
was
very
interesting
very
clever
an
excellent
préfet
de
police
some
of
his
stories
were
most
amusing
the
dinner
was
very
good
always
were
in
the
marshal
time
not
long
and
mercifully
the
room
was
not
too
hot
sometimes
the
heat
was
terrible
there
were
quite
a
number
of
people
in
the
evening
the
music
of
the
garde
républicaine
playing
and
a
buffet
in
the
which
was
always
crowded
we
never
stayed
very
late
as
always
had
papers
to
sign
when
we
got
home
sometimes
when
there
was
a
great
press
of
work
his
signatures
kept
him
two
hours
i
think
the
marshal
enjoyed
the
receptions
very
much
like
most
soldiers
he
was
an
early
riser
and
the
late
hours
and
constant
talking
tired
him
i
liked
our
dinners
and
receptions
at
the
ministry
all
the
intelligence
of
france
passed
through
our
rooms
people
generally
came
early
by
ten
the
rooms
were
quite
full
every
one
was
announced
and
it
was
most
interesting
to
hear
the
names
of
all
the
celebrities
in
every
branch
of
art
and
science
it
was
only
a
fleeting
impression
as
the
guests
merely
spoke
to
me
at
the
door
and
passed
on
in
those
days
hardly
any
one
shook
hands
unless
they
were
fairly
intimate
the
men
never
they
made
me
low
bows
some
distance
off
and
rarely
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
me
some
of
the
women
not
many
shook
hands
it
was
a
fatiguing
evening
as
i
stood
so
long
and
a
procession
of
strangers
passed
before
me
the
receptions
finished
early
every
one
had
gone
by
eleven
except
a
few
loiterers
at
the
buffet
there
are
always
a
certain
number
of
people
at
the
big
official
receptions
whose
principal
object
in
coming
seems
to
be
to
make
a
comfortable
meal
the
servants
always
told
me
there
was
nothing
left
after
a
big
party
there
were
no
invitations
the
reception
was
announced
in
the
papers
so
any
one
who
felt
he
had
the
slightest
claim
upon
the
minister
appeared
at
the
party
some
of
the
dresses
were
funny
but
there
was
nothing
eccentric
no
women
in
hats
carrying
babies
in
their
arms
such
as
one
used
to
see
in
the
old
days
in
america
at
the
president
reception
at
the
white
house
washington
some
very
simple
black
silk
dresses
hardly
low
and
of
course
a
great
many
pretty
women
very
well
dressed
some
of
my
american
friends
often
came
with
true
american
curiosity
wanting
to
see
a
phase
of
french
life
which
was
quite
novel
to
them
remained
two
years
as
minister
of
public
instruction
and
my
life
became
at
once
very
interesting
very
full
we
did
live
at
the
ministry
it
was
not
really
necessary
all
the
work
was
over
before
dinner
except
the
signatures
which
could
do
just
as
well
in
his
library
at
home
we
went
over
and
inspected
the
hôtel
du
ministère
in
the
rue
de
grenelle
before
we
made
our
final
decision
but
it
was
not
really
tempting
there
were
fine
and
a
pretty
garden
but
the
were
small
not
numerous
and
decidedly
gloomy
of
course
i
saw
much
less
of
he
never
came
home
to
breakfast
except
on
sunday
as
it
was
too
far
from
the
rue
de
grenelle
to
the
etoile
the
arc
de
triomphe
stands
in
the
place
de
at
the
top
of
the
all
the
great
avenues
alma
jéna
kléber
and
the
adjacent
streets
are
known
as
the
quartier
de
it
was
before
the
days
of
telephones
so
whenever
an
important
communication
was
to
be
made
to
him
when
he
was
at
home
in
the
evening
a
dragoon
galloped
up
with
his
little
black
bag
from
which
he
extracted
his
papers
it
made
quite
an
excitement
in
our
quiet
street
the
first
time
he
arrived
after
ten
we
just
managed
our
morning
ride
and
then
there
were
often
people
waiting
to
speak
to
before
we
started
and
always
when
he
came
back
there
was
a
great
amount
of
patronage
attached
to
his
ministry
nominations
to
all
the
universities
lycées
schools
and
what
was
most
agreeable
to
me
boxes
at
all
the
government
theatres
the
grand
opera
opéra
comique
français
odéon
and
conservatoire
every
monday
morning
we
received
the
list
for
the
week
and
after
making
our
own
selection
distributed
them
to
the
official
world
generally
sometimes
to
our
own
personal
friends
the
boxes
of
the
français
opéra
and
conservatoire
were
much
appreciated
i
went
very
regularly
to
the
sunday
afternoon
concerts
at
the
conservatoire
where
all
classical
music
was
splendidly
given
they
confined
themselves
generally
to
the
strictly
classic
but
were
beginning
to
play
a
little
schumann
that
year
some
of
the
faces
of
the
regular
habitués
became
most
familiar
to
me
there
were
three
or
four
old
men
with
grey
hair
sitting
in
the
first
row
of
stalls
most
uncomfortable
seats
who
followed
every
note
of
the
music
turning
around
and
frowning
at
any
unfortunate
person
in
a
box
who
dropped
a
fan
or
an
it
was
funny
to
hear
the
hum
of
satisfaction
when
any
movement
of
beethoven
or
mozart
was
attacked
the
orchestra
was
perfect
at
its
best
i
think
in
the
scherzos
which
they
took
in
beautiful
style
so
light
and
sure
i
liked
the
instrumental
part
much
better
than
the
singing
french
voices
the
women
particularly
are
thin
as
a
rule
i
think
they
sacrifice
too
much
to
the
diction
do
bring
out
the
voices
enough
but
the
style
and
training
are
perfect
of
their
kind
the
conservatoire
is
quite
as
much
a
social
feature
as
a
school
of
music
it
was
the
thing
to
do
on
sunday
afternoon
no
invitation
was
more
appreciated
as
it
was
almost
impossible
to
have
places
unless
one
was
invited
by
a
friend
all
the
boxes
and
seats
the
hall
is
small
belong
to
subscribers
and
have
done
so
for
one
or
two
generations
many
marriages
are
made
there
there
are
very
few
theatres
in
paris
to
which
girls
can
be
taken
but
the
opéra
comique
and
the
conservatoire
are
very
favourite
resorts
when
a
marriage
is
pending
the
young
lady
very
well
dressed
always
in
the
simplest
tenue
de
jeune
fille
is
taken
to
the
conservatoire
or
the
opéra
comique
by
her
father
and
mother
and
very
often
her
grandmother
she
sits
in
front
of
the
box
and
the
young
man
in
the
stalls
where
he
can
study
his
future
wife
without
committing
himself
the
difference
of
dress
between
the
jeune
fille
and
the
jeune
femme
is
very
strongly
marked
in
france
the
french
girl
never
wears
lace
or
jewels
or
feathers
or
heavy
material
of
any
kind
quite
unlike
her
english
or
american
contemporaries
who
wear
what
they
like
the
is
classic
a
simple
very
long
dress
of
white
satin
and
generally
a
tulle
veil
over
the
face
when
there
is
a
handsome
lace
veil
in
the
family
the
bride
sometimes
wears
it
but
no
lace
on
her
dress
the
first
thing
the
young
married
woman
does
is
to
wear
a
very
long
velvet
dress
with
feathers
in
her
hair
i
think
on
the
whole
the
arranged
marriages
turn
out
as
well
as
any
others
they
are
generally
made
by
people
of
the
same
monde
accustomed
to
the
same
way
of
living
and
the
fortunes
as
nearly
alike
as
possible
everything
is
calculated
the
young
couple
usually
spend
the
summer
with
parents
or
in
the
château
and
i
know
some
cases
where
there
are
curious
details
about
the
number
of
lamps
that
can
be
lighted
in
their
rooms
and
the
use
of
the
carriage
on
certain
days
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
purely
french
marriages
to
my
american
ideas
it
seemed
very
strange
when
i
first
came
to
europe
but
a
long
residence
in
a
foreign
country
certainly
modifies
one
impressions
years
ago
when
we
were
living
in
rome
four
sisters
before
any
of
us
were
married
a
charming
frenchwoman
duchesse
de
who
came
often
to
the
house
was
very
worried
about
this
family
of
girls
all
very
happy
at
home
and
contented
with
their
lives
it
was
quite
true
we
danced
and
hunted
and
made
a
great
deal
of
music
without
ever
troubling
ourselves
about
the
future
the
duchesse
could
understand
it
used
often
to
talk
to
mother
very
seriously
she
came
one
day
with
a
proposal
of
marriage
a
charming
man
a
frenchman
not
too
young
with
a
good
fortune
a
title
and
a
château
had
seen
madam
king
daughters
in
the
ballroom
and
and
would
very
much
like
to
be
presented
and
make
his
cour
which
one
we
naturally
asked
but
the
answer
was
vague
it
sounded
so
curiously
impersonal
that
we
could
hardly
take
it
seriously
however
we
suggested
that
the
young
man
should
come
and
each
one
of
the
four
would
show
off
her
particular
talent
one
would
play
and
one
would
sing
rather
like
the
song
in
the
children
book
one
could
dance
and
one
could
sing
and
one
could
play
the
violin
and
the
third
the
polyglot
of
the
family
could
speak
several
languages
we
were
rather
puzzled
as
to
what
my
eldest
sister
could
do
as
she
was
not
very
sociable
and
never
spoke
to
strangers
if
she
could
help
it
so
we
decided
she
must
be
very
well
dressed
and
preside
at
the
behind
an
silver
urn
that
we
always
used
looking
like
a
stately
maîtresse
de
maison
receiving
her
guests
we
confided
all
these
plans
to
the
duchesse
but
she
was
quite
put
out
with
us
would
bring
the
young
man
nor
tell
us
his
name
we
never
knew
who
he
was
since
i
have
been
a
frenchwoman
devant
la
loi
i
think
all
americans
remain
american
no
matter
where
they
marry
i
have
interested
myself
three
or
four
times
in
made
marriages
which
have
generally
turned
out
well
there
were
very
few
americans
married
in
france
all
those
years
now
there
are
legions
of
all
kinds
i
do
remember
any
in
the
official
parliamentary
world
i
lived
in
the
first
years
of
my
marriage
nor
english
either
it
was
absolutely
french
and
rather
borné
french
very
few
of
the
people
the
women
especially
had
any
knowledge
or
experience
of
foreign
countries
and
did
care
to
have
france
was
enough
for
them
was
very
happy
at
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
all
the
educational
questions
interested
him
so
much
and
the
tournées
en
province
and
visits
to
the
big
schools
and
universities
some
of
them
in
the
south
of
france
particularly
singularly
wanting
in
the
most
elementary
details
of
hygiene
and
cleanliness
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
make
the
necessary
changes
giving
more
light
air
and
space
routine
is
a
powerful
factor
in
this
very
conservative
country
where
so
many
things
exist
simply
because
they
have
always
existed
some
of
his
letters
from
bordeaux
toulouse
and
montpellier
were
most
interesting
as
a
rule
he
was
very
well
received
and
got
on
very
well
strangely
enough
with
the
clergy
particularly
the
haut
clergé
bishops
and
cardinals
his
being
a
protestant
was
rather
a
help
to
him
he
could
take
an
impartial
view
of
things
at
bordeaux
he
stayed
at
the
préfecture
where
he
was
very
comfortable
but
the
days
were
fatiguing
he
said
he
had
worked
so
hard
for
years
he
started
at
nine
in
the
morning
visiting
schools
and
universities
came
home
to
breakfast
at
twelve
and
immediately
after
had
a
small
reception
rectors
professors
and
people
connected
with
the
schools
he
wanted
to
talk
to
at
three
started
again
seeing
more
schools
and
going
conscientiously
over
the
buildings
from
basement
to
garret
then
visits
to
the
cardinal
archbishop
general
commanding
a
big
dinner
and
reception
in
the
evening
the
cardinal
present
in
his
red
robes
his
coadjutor
in
purple
the
officers
in
uniform
and
all
the
people
connected
in
any
way
with
the
university
who
were
pleased
to
see
their
chief
there
was
a
total
absence
of
bonapartist
senators
and
deputies
which
was
not
surprising
as
had
always
been
in
violent
opposition
to
the
empire
who
were
rather
numerous
in
these
parts
was
really
quite
exhausted
when
he
got
back
to
paris
said
it
was
absolute
luxury
to
sit
quietly
and
read
in
his
library
and
not
talk
it
was
a
luxury
that
he
enjoyed
very
much
for
whenever
he
was
in
the
house
there
was
always
some
one
talking
to
him
in
his
study
and
others
waiting
in
the
every
minute
of
the
day
he
was
occupied
people
were
always
coming
to
ask
for
something
for
themselves
or
some
members
of
their
family
always
candidates
for
the
institute
anxiously
inquiring
what
their
chances
were
and
if
he
had
recommended
them
to
his
friends
it
is
striking
even
in
this
country
of
functionaries
i
think
there
are
more
small
public
employees
in
france
than
in
any
other
country
how
many
applicants
there
were
always
for
the
most
insignificant
places
a
frenchman
loves
a
cap
with
gold
braid
and
gilt
buttons
on
his
coat
all
the
winter
of
which
saw
the
end
of
the
national
assembly
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
régime
was
an
eventful
one
in
parliamentary
circles
i
do
know
if
the
country
generally
was
very
much
excited
about
a
new
constitution
and
a
change
of
government
i
do
think
the
country
in
france
the
small
farmers
and
peasants
are
ever
much
excited
about
the
form
of
government
as
long
as
the
crops
are
good
and
there
is
no
war
to
take
away
their
sons
and
men
they
do
care
often
do
know
whether
a
king
or
an
emperor
is
reigning
over
them
they
say
there
are
some
villages
half
hidden
in
the
forests
and
mountains
who
still
believe
that
a
king
and
a
bourbon
is
reigning
in
france
something
had
to
be
decided
the
provisoire
could
no
longer
continue
the
country
could
not
go
on
without
a
settled
government
all
the
arguments
and
negotiations
of
that
period
have
been
so
often
told
that
i
will
not
go
into
any
details
the
two
centres
centre
droit
and
centre
gauche
had
everything
in
their
hands
as
the
great
moderating
elements
of
the
assembly
but
the
conflicting
claims
of
the
various
parties
legitimist
orleanist
bonapartist
and
advanced
left
made
the
question
a
very
difficult
one
as
a
member
of
the
comité
des
trente
was
very
much
occupied
and
preoccupied
he
came
back
generally
very
late
from
versailles
and
when
he
did
dine
at
home
either
went
out
again
after
dinner
to
some
of
the
numerous
meetings
at
different
houses
or
had
people
at
home
i
think
the
great
majority
of
deputies
were
honestly
trying
to
do
what
they
thought
best
for
the
country
and
when
one
remembers
the
names
and
personalities
on
both
sides
macmahon
broglie
buffet
dufaure
and
thiers
casimir
périer
léon
say
jules
simon
jules
ferry
freycinet
and
many
others
it
is
impossible
to
think
that
any
of
those
men
were
animated
by
any
spirit
other
than
love
of
the
country
and
an
ardent
desire
to
see
some
stable
government
restored
which
would
enable
france
to
take
her
place
again
among
the
great
powers
unfortunately
the
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
form
of
government
made
things
very
difficult
some
of
the
young
deputies
just
fresh
from
the
war
and
smarting
under
a
sense
of
humiliation
were
very
violent
in
their
abuse
of
any
royalist
and
particularly
bonapartist
restoration
illustration
meeting
of
officers
of
the
national
assembly
and
of
delegates
of
the
new
chambers
in
the
salon
of
hercules
palace
of
versailles
from
march
iv
the
social
side
of
a
minister
wife
my
first
big
dinner
at
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
rather
intimidated
me
we
were
fifty
people
i
the
only
lady
i
went
over
to
the
ministry
in
the
afternoon
to
see
the
table
which
was
very
well
arranged
with
quantities
of
flowers
beautiful
sèvres
china
not
much
silver
there
is
very
little
left
in
france
it
having
all
been
melted
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
official
dinners
are
always
well
done
in
paris
i
suppose
the
traditions
of
the
empire
have
been
handed
down
we
arrived
a
few
minutes
before
eight
all
the
staff
and
directors
already
there
and
by
ten
minutes
after
eight
every
one
had
arrived
i
sat
between
gérôme
the
painter
and
renan
two
very
different
men
but
each
quite
charming
gérôme
tall
slight
animated
talking
very
easily
about
everything
he
told
me
who
a
great
many
of
the
people
were
with
a
little
commentary
on
their
profession
and
career
which
was
very
useful
to
me
as
i
knew
so
few
of
them
renan
was
short
stout
with
a
very
large
head
almost
but
with
a
great
charm
of
manner
and
the
most
delightful
smile
and
voice
imaginable
he
often
dined
with
us
in
our
own
house
en
petit
comité
and
was
always
charming
he
was
one
of
those
happy
mortals
there
are
not
many
who
made
every
subject
they
discuss
interesting
after
that
first
experience
i
liked
the
big
men
dinners
very
much
there
was
no
general
conversation
i
talked
exclusively
to
my
two
neighbours
but
as
they
were
always
distinguished
in
some
branch
of
art
science
or
literature
the
talk
was
brilliant
and
i
found
the
hour
our
dinner
lasted
a
very
short
one
was
very
particular
about
not
having
long
dinners
later
at
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
where
we
sometimes
had
eighty
guests
the
dinner
was
never
over
an
hour
i
did
not
remain
the
whole
evening
at
the
men
dinners
as
soon
as
they
dispersed
to
talk
and
smoke
i
came
away
leaving
to
entertain
his
guests
we
often
had
big
receptions
with
music
and
comédie
at
one
of
our
first
big
parties
we
had
several
of
the
orléans
family
i
was
rather
nervous
as
i
had
never
received
royalty
in
fact
i
had
never
spoken
to
a
royal
prince
or
princess
i
had
lived
a
great
deal
in
rome
as
a
girl
during
the
last
days
of
pius
ix
and
i
was
never
in
paris
during
the
empire
when
we
went
back
to
rome
one
winter
after
the
accession
of
king
victor
emmanuel
i
found
myself
for
the
first
time
in
a
room
with
royalties
the
prince
and
princesse
de
piémont
i
remember
quite
well
being
so
surprised
by
seeing
two
of
the
roman
men
we
knew
very
well
come
backward
into
the
ballroom
where
we
were
sitting
i
thought
they
must
be
anticipating
the
mardi
gras
and
were
masquerading
a
little
realise
that
every
one
was
standing
i
remained
sitting
for
a
moment
much
to
the
horror
of
one
of
the
english
secretaries
who
was
with
us
and
who
thought
we
were
going
to
make
a
american
demonstration
and
remain
sitting
when
royalty
appeared
however
by
some
sort
of
instinct
we
rose
too
perhaps
to
see
what
was
going
on
just
as
the
princes
passed
princess
marguerite
looked
charming
dressed
in
white
with
her
splendid
pearls
and
beautiful
fair
hair
when
it
was
decided
that
we
should
ask
the
orléans
princes
to
our
party
i
thought
i
would
go
to
see
the
duc
décazes
the
foreign
minister
a
charming
man
and
charming
colleague
to
get
some
precise
information
about
my
part
of
the
entertainment
he
could
think
what
i
wanted
when
i
invaded
his
cabinet
and
was
much
amused
when
i
stated
my
case
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
receiving
the
princes
at
a
ministry
you
must
do
as
you
have
always
done
but
that
is
just
the
question
i
have
i
have
never
in
my
life
exchanged
a
word
with
a
royal
personage
it
is
not
possible
it
is
absolutely
true
i
have
never
lived
anywhere
where
there
was
a
court
when
he
saw
that
i
was
in
earnest
he
was
as
nice
as
possible
told
me
what
i
wanted
to
know
that
i
need
not
say
altesse
royale
every
time
i
spoke
merely
occasionally
as
they
all
like
it
that
i
must
speak
in
the
third
person
madame
monseigneur
me
permettre
also
that
i
must
always
be
at
the
door
when
a
princess
arrived
and
conduct
her
myself
to
her
seat
but
if
i
am
at
one
end
of
the
long
enfilade
of
rooms
taking
the
comtesse
de
paris
to
her
seat
and
another
princess
joinville
or
chartres
should
arrive
what
has
to
be
done
your
husband
must
always
be
at
the
door
with
his
chef
de
cabinet
who
will
replace
him
while
he
takes
the
princess
to
her
place
the
marquise
de
a
charming
old
lady
with
white
hair
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
a
great
friend
of
the
orléans
family
went
with
me
when
i
made
my
round
of
visits
to
thank
the
royal
ladies
for
accepting
our
invitation
we
found
no
one
but
the
princesse
marguerite
daughter
of
the
duc
de
nemours
who
was
living
at
neuilly
i
had
all
my
instructions
from
the
marquise
how
many
courtesies
to
make
how
to
address
her
and
above
all
not
to
speak
until
the
princess
spoke
to
me
we
were
shown
into
a
pretty
opening
on
a
garden
where
the
princess
was
waiting
standing
at
one
end
of
the
room
madame
de
named
me
i
made
my
courtesies
the
princess
shook
hands
and
then
we
remained
standing
facing
each
other
she
did
say
anything
i
stood
perfectly
straight
and
quiet
waiting
she
changed
colour
moved
her
hands
nervously
was
evidently
overcome
with
shyness
but
did
utter
a
sound
it
seemed
very
long
was
really
only
a
few
seconds
but
i
was
getting
rather
nervous
when
suddenly
a
child
ran
across
the
garden
that
broke
the
ice
and
she
asked
me
the
classic
royal
question
des
enfants
madame
i
had
only
one
and
he
was
rather
small
but
still
his
nurse
his
teeth
and
his
food
carried
me
on
for
a
little
while
and
after
that
we
had
some
general
conversation
but
i
ca
say
the
visit
was
really
interesting
as
long
as
i
was
in
public
life
i
regretted
that
i
had
but
the
one
child
children
and
nurseries
and
schoolrooms
were
always
an
unfailing
topic
of
conversation
frenchwomen
of
all
classes
take
much
more
interest
in
the
details
of
their
nurseries
and
the
education
and
of
their
children
than
we
do
i
know
several
mammas
who
followed
all
the
course
of
their
sons
studies
when
they
were
preparing
their
baccalauréat
even
to
writing
the
compositions
the
head
nurse
english
who
takes
entire
charge
of
her
nursery
who
does
like
any
interference
and
brings
the
children
to
their
mother
at
stated
hours
does
exist
in
france
our
party
was
very
brilliant
all
sorts
of
notabilities
of
all
kinds
and
the
leading
paris
artists
from
the
grand
opera
opéra
comique
and
the
français
as
soon
as
the
performance
was
over
told
me
i
must
go
and
thank
the
artists
he
could
not
leave
his
princes
i
started
off
to
the
last
of
the
long
suite
of
salons
where
they
were
all
assembled
comte
de
chef
de
cabinet
went
with
me
and
we
were
preceded
by
a
huissier
with
sword
and
chain
who
piloted
us
through
the
crowd
i
felt
very
shy
when
i
arrived
in
the
greenroom
the
artists
were
drawn
up
in
two
rows
the
women
on
one
side
the
men
on
the
other
all
eyes
of
course
fixed
upon
madame
la
ministresse
madame
carvalho
sarah
bernhardt
and
croizette
were
standing
at
the
head
of
the
long
line
of
women
faure
talazac
delaunay
coquelin
on
the
other
side
i
went
first
all
along
the
line
of
women
then
came
back
by
the
men
i
realised
instantly
after
the
first
word
of
thanks
and
interest
how
easy
it
is
for
princes
or
any
one
in
high
places
to
give
pleasure
they
all
responded
so
smilingly
and
naturally
to
everything
i
said
after
the
first
two
or
three
words
i
did
mind
at
all
and
found
myself
discussing
acoustics
the
difficulty
of
playing
any
part
without
costumes
scenery
the
inconvenience
of
having
the
public
so
near
quite
easily
we
often
had
music
and
recitations
at
our
parties
and
that
was
always
a
great
pleasure
to
me
i
remember
so
well
one
evening
when
we
had
the
chorus
of
the
conservatoire
and
they
sang
quite
beautifully
the
old
plaisirs
of
our
childhood
it
had
a
great
success
and
they
were
obliged
to
repeat
it
made
one
great
innovation
in
the
dress
of
the
ladies
of
the
conservatoire
chorus
they
were
always
dressed
in
white
which
was
very
well
for
the
young
slight
figures
but
was
less
happy
for
a
stout
lady
so
after
much
discussion
it
was
decided
to
adopt
black
as
the
official
dress
and
i
must
say
it
was
an
enormous
improvement
the
social
side
all
sorts
of
interesting
people
came
to
see
us
at
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
among
others
the
late
emperor
of
brazil
don
pedro
de
bragance
who
spent
some
months
in
paris
that
year
with
his
daughter
the
young
comtesse
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
charming
easy
manner
very
cultivated
and
very
keen
about
everything
art
literature
politics
his
gentlemen
said
he
had
the
energy
of
a
man
of
and
he
was
well
over
middle
age
when
he
was
in
paris
they
were
quite
exhausted
sometimes
after
a
long
day
of
visits
and
sightseeing
with
him
he
was
an
early
riser
one
of
the
first
rendezvous
he
gave
was
at
nine
in
the
morning
which
greatly
disturbed
that
gentleman
habits
he
was
never
an
early
riser
worked
always
very
late
said
his
best
despatches
were
written
after
midnight
and
did
care
about
beginning
his
day
too
early
another
interesting
personality
was
mommsen
the
german
historian
and
savant
he
was
a
old
man
with
keen
blue
eyes
and
a
quantity
of
white
hair
i
do
think
anything
modern
interested
him
very
much
he
was
an
old
man
when
i
first
saw
him
and
looked
even
older
than
his
age
he
and
used
to
plunge
into
very
long
learned
discussions
over
antiquities
and
medals
said
the
hours
with
mommsen
rested
him
such
a
change
from
the
shop
talk
always
mixed
with
politics
in
france
we
often
had
political
breakfasts
at
home
more
breakfasts
than
dinners
our
aisne
deputies
and
senators
were
not
very
mondains
care
much
to
dine
out
they
were
pleasant
enough
when
they
talked
about
subjects
that
interested
them
henri
martin
senator
of
the
aisne
was
an
republican
absolutely
convinced
that
no
other
government
would
ever
succeed
in
france
but
he
was
moderate
vallier
also
a
senator
from
the
aisne
was
nervous
and
easily
discouraged
when
things
did
go
smoothly
but
he
too
thought
the
republic
was
the
only
possible
government
now
whatever
his
preferences
might
have
been
formerly
ministry
came
to
an
end
on
the
famous
of
may
when
marshal
macmahon
suddenly
took
matters
in
his
own
hands
and
dismissed
his
cabinet
presided
over
by
jules
simon
things
had
not
been
going
smoothly
for
some
time
could
not
between
two
men
of
such
absolute
difference
of
origin
habits
and
ideas
still
the
famous
letter
written
by
the
marshal
to
jules
simon
was
a
thunderclap
i
was
walking
about
the
and
faubourg
honoré
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
and
saw
all
the
carriages
our
own
included
waiting
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
where
the
conseil
was
sitting
i
went
home
to
breakfast
thought
was
later
than
usual
but
never
dreamed
of
what
was
happening
when
he
finally
appeared
quite
composed
and
smiling
with
his
news
we
are
out
of
office
the
marshal
has
sent
us
all
about
our
business
i
could
hardly
believe
it
even
when
he
told
me
all
the
details
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
things
were
not
going
well
but
there
were
always
so
much
friction
and
such
opposing
elements
in
the
cabinet
that
i
had
not
attached
much
importance
to
the
accounts
of
stormy
sittings
and
thought
things
would
settle
down
illustration
theodor
mommsen
from
a
painting
by
franz
von
lenbach
said
the
marshal
was
very
civil
to
him
but
it
was
evident
that
he
could
not
stand
jules
simon
any
longer
and
the
various
measures
that
he
felt
were
impending
we
had
many
visitors
after
breakfast
all
much
excited
wondering
what
the
next
step
would
be
if
the
chambers
would
be
dissolved
the
marshal
trying
to
impose
a
cabinet
of
the
right
or
perhaps
form
another
moderate
liberal
cabinet
without
jules
simon
but
retaining
some
of
his
ministers
it
was
my
reception
afternoon
and
while
i
was
sitting
quietly
in
my
talking
to
some
of
my
friends
making
plans
for
the
summer
quite
pleased
to
have
to
myself
again
the
butler
hurried
into
the
room
telling
me
that
the
maréchale
de
macmahon
was
on
the
stairs
coming
to
make
me
a
visit
i
was
very
much
surprised
as
she
never
came
to
see
me
we
met
very
rarely
except
on
official
occasions
and
she
made
no
secret
of
her
dislike
to
the
official
republican
ladies
but
she
was
always
absolutely
correct
if
not
enthusiastic
i
had
just
time
to
get
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
receive
her
she
was
very
amiable
a
little
embarrassed
took
a
cup
of
tea
said
the
marshal
was
very
sorry
to
part
with
he
had
never
had
any
trouble
or
disagreement
with
him
of
any
kind
but
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
with
a
cabinet
when
neither
party
had
any
confidence
in
the
other
i
quite
agreed
said
it
was
the
fortunes
of
war
i
hoped
the
marshal
would
find
another
premier
who
would
be
more
sympathetic
with
him
and
then
we
talked
of
other
things
my
friends
were
quite
amused
one
of
them
marquise
de
knew
the
maréchale
quite
well
and
said
she
was
going
to
ask
her
if
she
was
obliged
to
make
visites
de
condoléance
to
the
wives
of
all
the
fallen
ministers
was
rather
astonished
when
i
told
him
who
had
come
to
tea
with
me
and
thought
the
conversation
must
have
been
difficult
i
told
him
not
at
all
once
the
necessary
phrases
about
the
departing
ministers
were
over
the
piano
was
open
music
littered
about
she
was
fond
of
music
and
she
admired
very
much
a
portrait
of
father
as
a
boy
in
the
harrow
dress
asked
who
it
was
and
what
the
dress
was
she
was
a
perfect
woman
of
the
world
and
no
one
was
uncomfortable
it
seemed
quite
strange
and
very
pleasant
to
take
up
my
old
life
again
after
two
years
of
public
life
breakfasted
at
home
went
to
the
senate
every
day
and
to
the
institute
on
fridays
and
we
dined
with
our
friends
and
had
small
dinners
in
our
own
house
instead
of
official
banquets
at
all
the
ministries
usually
from
potel
and
chabot
at
so
much
a
head
politics
were
very
lively
all
summer
the
chambers
were
dissolved
almost
at
once
after
the
constitution
of
the
new
cabinet
presided
over
by
the
duc
de
broglie
it
was
evident
from
the
first
moment
that
the
new
ministry
would
could
live
the
duc
de
broglie
was
quite
aware
of
the
fact
his
first
words
on
taking
office
were
on
nous
a
jetés
à
maintenant
il
faut
nager
he
made
a
very
good
fight
but
he
had
that
worst
of
all
faults
for
a
leader
he
was
unpopular
he
was
a
brilliant
cultured
speaker
but
had
a
curt
dictatorial
manner
with
an
air
always
of
looking
down
upon
his
public
so
different
from
his
colleague
the
duc
décazes
whose
charming
courteous
manners
and
nice
blue
eyes
made
him
friends
even
among
his
adversaries
there
is
a
story
told
of
the
two
dukes
which
shows
exactly
the
personality
of
the
men
some
one
a
deputy
i
think
wanted
something
very
much
which
either
of
the
gentlemen
could
give
he
went
first
to
the
duc
décazes
then
minister
of
foreign
affairs
who
received
him
charmingly
was
most
kind
and
courteous
but
did
do
what
the
man
wanted
he
then
went
to
the
duc
de
broglie
président
du
conseil
who
was
busy
received
him
very
curtly
cut
short
his
explanations
and
was
in
fact
extremely
disagreeable
but
did
the
thing
and
the
man
loved
décazes
and
hated
de
broglie
all
sorts
of
rumours
were
afloat
we
used
to
hear
the
wildest
stories
and
plans
one
day
came
in
looking
rather
preoccupied
there
was
an
idea
that
the
right
were
going
to
take
most
stringent
measures
arrest
all
the
ministers
members
of
jules
simon
cabinet
many
of
the
prominent
liberals
he
said
it
was
quite
possible
and
then
gave
me
various
instructions
i
was
above
all
to
make
no
fuss
if
they
really
came
to
arrest
him
he
showed
me
where
all
his
keys
papers
and
money
were
told
me
to
go
instantly
to
his
uncle
lutteroth
who
lived
next
door
he
was
an
old
diplomat
knew
everybody
and
would
give
me
very
good
advice
i
did
not
feel
very
happy
but
like
so
many
things
that
are
foretold
nothing
ever
happened
another
rumour
from
the
extreme
left
this
time
was
that
a
large
armed
force
under
the
command
of
a
general
very
high
up
in
his
career
was
to
assemble
in
the
north
at
lille
a
strong
contingent
of
republicans
were
to
join
them
to
be
ready
to
act
i
remember
quite
well
two
of
friends
coming
in
one
morning
full
of
enthusiasm
for
this
plan
i
do
think
they
quite
knew
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
their
army
certainly
did
not
he
listened
to
all
the
details
of
the
plan
they
gave
him
the
name
of
the
general
supposed
to
have
very
republican
sympathies
not
generally
the
case
with
officers
the
number
of
regiments
who
would
march
at
a
given
signal
but
when
he
said
it
is
possible
you
might
get
a
certain
number
of
men
together
but
what
would
you
do
with
them
they
were
rather
nonplussed
they
got
any
further
than
a
grand
patriotic
demonstration
with
the
military
drums
beating
flags
flying
and
the
marseillaise
being
howled
by
an
excited
crowd
no
such
extreme
measures
however
were
ever
carried
out
from
the
first
moment
it
was
evident
that
a
large
republican
majority
would
be
returned
almost
all
the
former
deputies
were
and
a
number
of
new
ones
more
advanced
in
their
opinion
in
the
country
it
was
the
only
topic
of
conversation
parliament
was
dissolved
in
june
but
we
remained
in
town
until
the
end
of
july
it
was
very
warm
and
many
people
remained
until
the
end
of
the
session
the
big
schools
too
only
break
up
on
the
of
july
and
many
parents
remain
in
paris
the
republican
campaign
had
already
begun
and
there
were
numerous
little
dinners
and
meetings
when
plans
and
possibilities
were
discussed
got
back
usually
very
late
from
versailles
when
he
knew
the
sitting
would
be
very
late
he
sent
me
word
and
i
used
to
go
and
dine
with
mother
but
sometimes
he
was
kept
on
there
from
hour
to
hour
i
had
some
long
waits
before
we
could
dine
and
hubert
the
coachman
used
to
spend
hours
in
the
courtyard
of
the
gare
lazare
waiting
for
his
master
we
had
a
big
bay
mare
a
very
fast
trotter
which
always
did
the
train
service
and
the
two
were
stationed
there
sometimes
from
to
but
they
never
seemed
the
worse
for
it
though
a
very
considerate
man
for
his
servants
generally
never
worried
at
all
about
keeping
his
coachmen
and
horses
waiting
he
said
the
coachmen
were
the
most
warmly
dressed
men
in
paris
always
took
care
to
be
well
covered
and
we
never
had
fancy
horses
but
ordinary
strong
ones
which
could
wait
patiently
said
the
talk
in
the
chambers
and
in
the
lobbies
was
quite
wild
every
sort
of
extravagant
proposition
was
made
there
were
many
conferences
with
the
duc
duc
de
broglie
with
casimir
périer
léon
say
gambetta
jules
ferry
and
freycinet
where
the
best
men
on
both
sides
tried
hard
to
come
to
an
agreement
went
several
times
in
august
to
see
thiers
who
was
settled
at
germain
the
old
statesman
was
as
keen
as
ever
receiving
every
day
all
sorts
of
deputations
advising
warning
encouraging
and
quite
confident
as
to
the
result
of
the
elections
people
were
looking
to
him
as
the
next
president
despite
his
great
age
however
he
was
not
destined
to
see
the
triumph
of
his
ideas
he
died
suddenly
at
germain
on
the
of
september
said
his
funeral
was
a
remarkable
sight
thousands
of
people
followed
the
cortège
all
paris
showing
a
last
respect
to
the
libérateur
du
territoire
though
there
were
still
clubs
where
he
was
spoken
of
as
le
sinistre
vieillard
in
august
went
to
his
at
laon
and
i
went
down
to
my
place
at
léger
near
rouen
we
were
a
very
happy
cosmopolitan
my
was
born
a
chisholm
she
was
a
fine
type
of
the
cultivated
lady
with
a
charming
polite
manner
keenly
interested
in
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
world
she
was
an
old
lady
when
i
married
and
had
outlived
almost
all
her
contemporaries
but
she
had
a
beautiful
old
age
surrounded
by
children
and
grandchildren
she
had
lived
through
many
vicissitudes
from
the
time
of
her
marriage
when
she
arrived
at
the
château
of
remy
in
the
department
of
where
my
husband
her
eldest
son
was
born
passing
through
triumphal
arches
erected
in
honour
of
the
young
bride
to
the
last
days
when
the
fortunes
of
the
family
were
diminished
by
revolutions
and
political
and
business
crises
in
france
they
moved
from
remy
selling
the
château
and
built
a
house
on
the
top
of
a
green
hill
near
rouen
quite
shut
in
by
big
trees
and
with
a
lovely
view
from
the
rond
point
the
highest
part
of
the
garden
over
rouen
with
the
spires
of
the
cathedral
in
the
distance
i
used
to
find
her
every
morning
when
i
went
to
her
room
sitting
at
the
window
her
books
and
knitting
on
a
table
near
looking
down
on
the
lawn
and
the
steep
winding
path
that
came
up
from
the
garden
where
she
had
seen
three
generations
of
her
dear
ones
pass
every
day
first
her
husband
then
her
sons
now
her
grandsons
my
wife
was
also
an
englishwoman
the
daughter
of
the
house
had
married
her
cousin
de
bunsen
who
had
been
a
german
diplomatist
and
who
had
made
nearly
all
his
career
in
italy
at
the
most
interesting
period
of
her
history
when
she
was
struggling
for
emancipation
from
the
austrian
rule
and
independence
i
was
an
american
quite
a
new
element
in
the
family
circle
we
had
many
and
most
animated
discussions
over
all
sorts
of
subjects
in
two
or
three
languages
at
the
under
the
big
tree
on
the
lawn
french
and
english
were
always
going
and
often
german
as
de
bunsen
always
spoke
to
his
daughter
in
german
my
who
knew
three
or
four
languages
did
not
at
all
approve
of
the
careless
habit
we
had
all
got
into
of
mixing
our
languages
and
using
french
or
italian
words
when
we
were
speaking
english
if
they
came
more
easily
she
made
a
rule
that
we
should
use
only
one
language
at
meals
she
did
care
which
one
but
we
must
keep
to
it
my
was
standing
for
the
deputation
we
did
see
much
of
him
in
the
daytime
his
electors
and
his
visits
and
speeches
and
banquets
de
pompiers
took
up
all
his
time
the
beginning
of
his
career
had
been
very
different
he
was
educated
in
england
rugby
and
woolwich
and
served
several
years
in
the
royal
artillery
in
the
british
army
his
military
training
was
very
useful
to
him
during
the
war
when
he
equipped
and
commanded
a
field
battery
making
all
the
campaign
his
english
brother
officers
always
remembered
him
many
times
when
we
were
living
in
england
at
the
embassy
i
was
asked
about
him
a
curious
thing
happened
in
the
house
of
lords
one
day
showing
the
wonderful
memory
of
princes
for
faces
was
staying
with
us
for
a
few
days
when
the
annual
debate
over
the
bill
for
marriage
of
a
deceased
wife
sister
came
up
the
prince
of
wales
late
king
edward
and
all
the
other
princes
were
present
in
the
house
was
there
too
standing
where
all
the
strangers
do
at
the
entrance
of
the
lobby
when
the
debate
was
over
the
prince
of
wales
left
as
he
passed
along
he
shook
hands
with
several
gentlemen
also
standing
near
the
lobby
including
he
stopped
a
moment
in
front
of
him
saying
i
think
this
is
waddington
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
wore
her
uniform
he
had
seen
him
for
or
thirty
years
i
asked
the
prince
afterward
how
he
recognised
him
he
said
he
did
know
it
was
perhaps
noticing
an
unfamiliar
face
in
the
group
of
men
standing
there
and
something
recalled
his
brother
the
ambassador
in
september
we
went
down
to
bourneville
and
settled
ourselves
there
for
the
autumn
was
standing
for
the
senate
with
the
count
de
vallier
and
henri
martin
they
all
preferred
being
named
in
their
department
where
everybody
knew
them
and
their
personal
influence
could
make
itself
more
easily
felt
campaign
was
not
very
arduous
all
the
people
knew
him
and
liked
him
knew
that
he
would
do
whatever
he
promised
their
programme
was
absolutely
republican
but
moderate
and
he
only
made
a
few
speeches
and
went
about
the
country
a
little
i
often
went
with
him
when
he
rode
and
some
of
our
visits
to
the
farmers
and
local
authorities
were
amusing
if
not
encouraging
we
were
always
very
well
received
but
it
was
easy
to
find
out
what
they
really
thought
if
they
did
think
about
it
at
all
of
the
state
of
affairs
the
small
landowners
particularly
the
men
who
had
one
field
and
a
garden
were
very
reserved
they
listened
attentively
enough
to
all
had
to
say
he
was
never
long
never
personal
and
never
abused
his
adversaries
but
they
rarely
expressed
an
opinion
they
almost
always
turned
the
conversation
upon
some
local
matter
or
petty
grievance
it
did
seem
to
me
that
they
took
the
slightest
interest
in
the
extraordinary
changes
that
were
going
on
in
france
a
great
many
people
came
to
see
and
there
would
be
a
curious
collection
sometimes
in
his
library
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
doctor
who
always
had
precise
information
country
doctors
always
have
they
see
a
great
many
people
and
i
fancy
the
women
talk
to
them
and
tell
them
what
their
men
are
doing
one
or
two
farmers
some
schoolmasters
the
mayors
of
the
nearest
villages
the
captains
of
the
firemen
and
of
the
archers
they
still
shoot
with
bow
and
arrow
in
our
part
of
the
country
every
sunday
the
men
practise
shooting
at
a
target
the
gendarmes
very
useful
these
too
to
bring
news
the
notary
and
occasionally
a
but
then
he
was
a
personage
representing
the
government
and
was
treated
with
more
ceremony
than
the
other
visitors
it
was
evident
from
all
these
sources
that
the
republicans
were
coming
to
the
front
en
masse
the
republicans
for
once
were
marvellously
disciplined
and
kept
together
it
was
really
wonderful
when
one
thought
of
all
the
different
elements
that
were
represented
in
the
party
there
was
quite
as
much
difference
between
the
quiet
moderate
men
of
the
left
centre
and
the
extreme
left
as
there
was
between
the
legitimists
and
any
faction
of
the
republican
party
there
was
a
strong
feeling
among
the
liberals
that
they
were
being
coerced
that
arbitrary
measures
perhaps
a
coup
would
be
sprung
upon
them
and
they
were
quite
determined
to
resist
i
do
think
there
was
ever
any
danger
of
a
coup
at
least
as
long
as
marshal
macmahon
was
the
chief
of
state
he
was
a
fine
honourable
patriotic
soldier
utterly
incapable
of
an
illegality
of
any
kind
he
did
like
the
republic
honestly
thought
it
would
never
succeed
with
the
republicans
la
république
sans
républicains
was
for
him
its
only
chance
and
he
certainly
had
illusions
and
thought
his
friends
and
advisers
would
succeed
in
making
and
keeping
a
firm
conservative
government
how
far
that
illusion
was
shared
by
his
entourage
it
is
difficult
to
say
they
fought
their
battle
well
government
pressure
exercised
in
all
ways
préfets
and
changed
wonderful
prospects
of
little
work
and
high
pay
held
out
to
doubtful
electors
and
the
same
bright
illusive
promises
made
to
the
masses
which
all
parties
make
in
all
elections
and
which
the
people
believe
each
time
the
republicans
were
not
idle
either
and
many
fiery
patriotic
speeches
were
made
or
their
side
gambetta
always
held
his
public
with
his
passionate
earnest
declamation
and
his
famous
phrase
that
the
marshal
must
se
soumettre
ou
se
démettre
became
a
password
all
through
the
country
v
a
republican
victory
and
a
new
ministry
the
elections
took
place
in
and
gave
at
once
a
great
republican
majority
and
his
two
colleagues
count
de
vallier
and
henri
martin
had
an
easy
victory
but
a
great
many
of
their
personal
friends
moderates
were
beaten
the
centres
were
decidedly
weaker
in
the
new
chambers
there
was
not
much
hope
left
of
uniting
the
two
centres
droite
et
gauche
in
the
famous
fusion
which
had
been
a
dream
of
the
moderate
men
the
new
chambers
assembled
at
versailles
in
november
the
broglie
cabinet
was
out
but
a
new
ministry
of
the
right
faced
the
new
parliament
their
life
was
very
short
and
stormy
they
were
really
dead
before
they
began
to
exist
and
in
december
the
marshal
sent
for
dufaure
and
charged
him
to
form
a
ministère
de
gauche
none
of
his
personal
friends
except
general
borel
at
the
war
office
was
in
the
new
combination
was
named
to
the
foreign
office
i
was
rather
disappointed
when
he
came
home
and
told
me
he
had
accepted
that
portfolio
i
thought
his
old
ministry
public
instruction
suited
him
so
well
the
work
interested
him
was
entirely
to
his
taste
he
knew
all
the
literary
and
educational
world
not
only
in
france
but
everywhere
else
england
of
course
where
he
had
kept
up
with
many
of
his
cambridge
comrades
and
germany
where
he
also
had
literary
connections
however
that
wide
acquaintance
and
his
perfect
knowledge
of
english
and
english
people
helped
him
very
much
at
once
not
only
at
the
quai
but
in
all
the
years
he
was
in
england
as
ambassador
the
new
ministry
with
dufaure
as
president
of
the
council
léon
say
at
the
finances
de
freycinet
at
public
works
and
at
the
foreign
office
was
announced
the
of
december
the
preliminaries
had
been
long
and
difficult
the
marshal
and
his
friends
on
one
side
the
republicans
and
gambetta
on
the
other
the
moderates
trying
to
keep
things
together
personally
i
was
rather
sorry
had
agreed
to
be
a
member
of
the
cabinet
i
was
not
very
keen
about
official
life
and
foresaw
a
great
deal
that
would
be
disagreeable
politics
played
such
a
part
in
social
life
all
the
society
the
faubourg
germain
which
represents
the
old
names
and
titles
of
france
was
violently
opposed
to
the
republic
i
was
astonished
the
first
years
of
my
married
life
in
france
to
see
people
of
certain
position
and
standing
give
the
cold
shoulder
to
men
they
had
known
all
their
lives
because
they
were
republicans
knowing
them
quite
well
to
be
honourable
independent
gentlemen
wanting
nothing
from
the
republic
merely
trying
to
do
their
best
for
the
country
i
only
realised
by
degrees
that
people
held
off
a
little
from
me
sometimes
as
the
wife
of
a
republican
deputy
i
care
particularly
as
i
had
never
lived
in
france
and
knew
very
few
people
but
it
did
make
social
relations
very
pleasant
and
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
if
had
taken
no
active
part
however
that
feeling
was
only
temporary
i
soon
became
keenly
interested
in
politics
i
suppose
it
is
in
the
blood
all
the
men
in
my
family
in
america
were
politicians
and
in
the
discussion
of
the
various
questions
which
were
rapidly
changing
france
into
something
quite
different
whether
the
change
has
been
for
the
better
it
would
be
hard
to
say
even
now
after
more
than
years
of
the
republic
freycinet
was
a
great
strength
he
was
absolutely
republican
but
moderate
very
clever
and
energetic
a
great
friend
of
gambetta
and
a
beautiful
speaker
i
have
heard
men
say
who
did
care
about
him
particularly
and
who
were
not
at
all
of
his
way
of
thinking
that
they
would
rather
not
discuss
with
him
he
was
sure
to
win
them
over
to
his
cause
with
his
wonderful
clear
persuasive
arguments
illustration
palace
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
paris
the
first
days
were
very
busy
ones
had
to
see
all
his
staff
a
very
large
one
of
the
foreign
office
and
organise
his
own
cabinet
he
was
out
all
day
until
late
in
the
evening
at
the
quai
used
to
go
over
there
about
ten
or
breakfast
there
and
get
back
for
a
very
late
dinner
and
always
had
a
director
or
secretary
working
with
him
at
our
own
house
after
dinner
i
went
over
three
or
four
times
to
inspect
the
ministry
as
i
had
a
presentiment
we
should
end
by
living
there
the
house
is
large
and
handsome
with
a
fine
staircase
and
large
high
rooms
the
furniture
of
course
was
ministerial
stiff
and
heavy
chairs
and
sofas
standing
in
rows
against
the
walls
there
were
some
good
pictures
among
others
the
congrès
de
paris
which
occupies
a
prominent
place
in
one
of
the
salons
and
splendid
tapestries
the
most
attractive
thing
was
a
fine
large
garden
at
the
back
but
as
the
were
we
did
use
it
very
much
the
lower
rooms
which
opened
on
the
gardens
were
only
used
as
the
minister
cabinet
was
also
communicating
by
a
small
staircase
with
his
bedroom
just
overhead
the
front
of
the
house
looks
on
the
seine
we
had
always
a
charming
view
from
the
windows
at
night
particularly
when
all
the
little
steamers
mouches
were
passing
with
their
lights
i
had
of
course
to
make
acquaintance
with
all
the
diplomatic
corps
i
knew
all
the
ambassadors
and
most
of
the
ministers
but
there
were
some
representatives
of
the
smaller
powers
and
south
american
republics
with
whom
i
had
never
come
in
contact
again
i
paid
a
formal
official
visit
to
the
maréchale
de
macmahon
as
soon
as
the
ministry
was
announced
she
was
perfectly
polite
and
correct
but
one
felt
at
once
she
had
the
slightest
sympathy
for
anything
republican
and
we
never
got
to
know
each
other
any
better
all
the
months
we
were
thrown
together
we
remained
for
several
weeks
at
our
own
house
and
then
most
reluctantly
determined
to
install
ourselves
at
the
ministry
worked
always
very
late
after
dinner
and
he
felt
it
was
not
possible
to
ask
his
directors
all
important
men
of
a
certain
age
to
come
up
to
the
quartier
de
at
ten
and
keep
them
busy
until
midnight
new
chef
de
cabinet
comte
de
pontécoulant
was
very
anxious
that
we
should
move
thought
everything
would
be
simplified
if
were
living
over
there
i
had
never
known
pontécoulant
until
chose
him
as
his
chef
de
cabinet
he
was
a
diplomatist
with
some
years
of
service
behind
him
and
was
perfectly
au
courant
of
all
the
routine
and
habits
of
the
foreign
office
he
paid
me
a
short
formal
visit
soon
after
he
had
accepted
the
post
we
exchanged
a
few
remarks
about
the
situation
i
hoped
we
would
faire
bon
ménage
and
had
no
particular
impression
of
him
except
that
he
was
very
french
and
stiff
i
did
suppose
i
should
see
much
of
him
it
seems
curious
now
to
look
back
upon
that
first
interview
we
all
became
so
fond
of
him
he
was
a
loyal
faithful
friend
was
always
ready
to
help
me
in
any
small
difficulties
and
i
went
to
him
for
everything
visits
servants
horses
etc
had
no
time
for
any
details
or
amenities
of
life
we
moved
over
just
before
new
year
day
as
the
gros
mobilier
was
already
there
we
only
took
over
personal
things
grand
piano
screens
tables
easy
chairs
and
small
ornaments
and
bibelots
these
were
all
sent
off
in
a
van
early
one
morning
and
after
luncheon
i
went
over
having
given
rendezvous
to
pontécoulant
and
kruft
chef
du
matériel
an
excellent
intelligent
man
who
was
most
useful
and
devoted
to
me
the
two
years
i
lived
at
the
ministry
i
was
very
depressed
when
we
drove
into
the
courtyard
i
had
never
lived
on
that
side
of
the
river
and
felt
cut
off
from
all
my
belongings
the
bridge
a
terror
so
cold
in
winter
so
hot
in
summer
i
never
got
accustomed
to
it
never
crossed
it
on
foot
the
sight
of
the
great
empty
rooms
did
reassure
me
the
of
course
were
very
handsome
there
were
a
great
many
servants
huissiers
and
footmen
standing
about
and
people
waiting
in
the
big
to
speak
to
the
were
ghastly
looked
bare
and
uncomfortable
in
the
highest
degree
they
were
large
and
high
and
looked
down
upon
the
garden
though
that
on
a
bleak
december
day
was
not
very
cheerful
but
there
were
possibilities
kruft
was
very
sympathetic
understood
quite
well
how
i
felt
and
was
ready
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
stoves
baths
wardrobes
in
the
lingerie
new
carpets
and
curtains
that
i
wanted
pontécoulant
too
was
eminently
practical
and
i
was
quite
amused
to
find
myself
discussing
lingeries
and
bathrooms
with
a
total
stranger
whom
i
had
only
seen
twice
in
my
life
it
took
me
about
a
week
to
get
really
settled
i
went
over
every
day
returning
to
my
own
house
to
eat
and
sleep
kruft
did
wonders
the
place
was
quite
transformed
when
i
finally
moved
over
the
rooms
looked
very
bright
and
comfortable
when
we
arrived
in
the
afternoon
of
the
of
december
new
year
eve
the
little
end
salon
which
i
made
my
boudoir
was
hung
with
blue
satin
my
piano
screens
and
little
things
were
very
well
placed
plenty
of
palms
and
flowers
bright
fires
everywhere
the
bedrooms
nursery
and
lingeries
clean
and
bright
my
bedroom
opened
on
a
large
salon
where
i
received
usually
keeping
my
boudoir
for
ourselves
and
our
intimate
friends
my
special
huissier
gérard
who
sat
all
day
outside
of
the
salon
door
was
presented
to
me
and
instantly
became
a
most
useful
and
important
member
of
the
household
never
forgot
a
name
or
a
face
remembered
what
cards
and
notes
i
had
received
whether
the
notes
were
answered
or
the
bills
paid
knew
almost
all
my
wardrobe
would
bring
me
down
a
coat
or
a
wrap
if
i
wanted
one
suddenly
i
had
frequent
consultations
with
pontécoulant
and
kruft
to
regulate
all
the
details
of
the
various
services
before
we
were
quite
settled
we
took
over
all
our
own
servants
and
found
many
others
who
were
on
the
permanent
staff
of
the
ministry
footmen
huissiers
and
odd
men
who
attended
to
all
the
fires
opened
and
shut
all
the
doors
windows
and
shutters
it
was
rather
difficult
to
organise
the
regular
working
service
there
was
such
rivalry
between
our
own
personal
servants
and
the
men
who
belonged
to
the
house
but
after
a
little
while
things
went
pretty
smoothly
dined
out
the
first
night
we
slept
at
the
quai
and
about
an
hour
after
we
had
arrived
while
i
was
still
walking
about
in
my
hat
and
coat
feeling
very
strange
in
the
big
high
rooms
i
was
told
that
the
lampiste
was
waiting
my
orders
a
few
lamps
had
been
lit
in
some
of
the
rooms
i
did
quite
know
what
orders
to
give
had
mastered
yet
the
number
that
would
be
required
but
i
sent
for
him
said
i
should
be
alone
for
dinner
perhaps
one
or
two
lamps
in
the
and
small
salon
would
be
enough
he
evidently
thought
that
was
not
at
all
sufficient
wanted
something
more
precise
so
i
said
to
light
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
when
the
duc
décazes
and
his
family
were
dining
alone
which
i
do
suppose
they
ever
did
nor
we
either
when
we
once
took
up
our
life
such
a
blaze
of
light
met
my
eyes
when
i
went
to
dinner
that
i
was
quite
bewildered
boudoir
very
large
the
small
round
table
for
one
person
hardly
perceptible
and
corridors
all
lighted
à
giorno
however
it
looked
very
cheerful
and
kept
me
from
feeling
too
dreadfully
homesick
for
my
own
house
and
familiar
surroundings
the
rooms
were
so
high
up
that
we
did
hear
the
noise
of
the
street
but
the
river
looked
alive
and
friendly
with
the
lights
on
the
bridges
and
a
few
boats
still
running
we
had
much
more
receiving
and
entertaining
to
do
at
the
quai
than
at
any
other
ministry
and
were
obliged
to
go
out
much
more
ourselves
the
season
in
the
official
world
begins
with
a
reception
at
the
president
on
new
year
day
the
diplomatic
corps
and
presidents
of
the
senate
and
chamber
go
in
state
to
the
elysée
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
chief
of
state
the
ambassadors
with
all
their
staff
in
uniform
in
gala
carriages
it
is
a
pretty
sight
and
there
are
always
a
good
many
people
waiting
in
the
faubourg
honoré
to
see
the
carriages
the
english
carriage
is
always
the
best
they
understand
all
the
details
of
harness
and
livery
so
much
better
than
any
one
else
the
marshal
and
his
family
were
established
at
the
elysée
it
possible
for
him
to
remain
at
versailles
he
could
be
so
far
from
paris
where
all
sorts
of
questions
were
coming
up
every
day
and
he
was
obliged
to
receive
deputations
and
reports
and
see
people
of
all
kinds
they
were
already
agitating
the
question
of
the
parliament
coming
back
to
paris
the
deputies
generally
were
complaining
of
the
loss
of
time
and
the
discomfort
of
the
daily
journey
even
in
the
parliamentary
train
the
right
generally
was
very
much
opposed
to
having
the
chambers
back
in
paris
i
never
could
understand
why
i
suppose
they
were
afraid
that
a
stormy
sitting
might
lead
to
disturbances
in
the
streets
of
a
big
city
there
is
always
a
floating
population
ready
to
espouse
violently
any
cause
at
versailles
one
was
away
from
any
such
danger
and
except
immediately
around
the
palace
there
was
nobody
in
the
long
deserted
avenues
they
often
cited
the
united
states
how
no
statesman
after
the
signing
of
the
declaration
of
independence
in
philadelphia
would
have
ventured
to
propose
that
the
parliament
should
sit
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
but
the
reason
there
was
very
different
they
were
obliged
to
make
a
neutral
zone
something
between
the
north
and
the
south
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
thing
apart
belonging
to
neither
side
it
has
certainly
worked
very
well
in
america
washington
is
a
fine
city
with
its
splendid
old
trees
and
broad
avenues
it
has
a
cachet
of
its
own
is
unlike
any
other
city
i
know
in
the
world
the
marshal
received
at
the
elysée
every
thursday
evening
he
and
his
staff
in
uniform
also
all
the
officers
who
came
which
made
a
brilliant
gathering
their
big
dinners
and
receptions
were
always
extremely
well
done
except
a
few
of
their
personal
friends
not
many
people
of
society
were
present
the
diplomatic
corps
usually
very
well
represented
the
government
and
their
wives
and
a
certain
number
of
liberal
deputies
a
great
many
officers
we
received
every
fifteen
days
beginning
with
a
big
dinner
it
was
an
open
reception
announced
in
the
papers
the
diplomats
always
mustered
very
strong
also
the
parliament
not
many
women
many
of
the
deputies
remained
in
the
country
taking
rooms
merely
while
the
chambers
were
sitting
and
their
wives
never
appeared
in
paris
society
did
come
to
us
much
either
except
on
certain
occasions
when
we
had
a
royal
prince
or
some
very
distinguished
foreigners
besides
the
big
official
receptions
we
often
had
small
dinners
during
the
week
some
of
these
i
look
back
to
with
much
pleasure
i
was
generally
the
only
lady
with
eight
or
ten
men
and
the
talk
was
often
brilliant
some
of
our
habitués
were
the
late
lord
houghton
a
delightful
talker
lord
dufferin
then
ambassador
in
petersburg
sir
henry
layard
british
ambassador
in
spain
an
interesting
man
who
had
been
everywhere
and
seen
and
known
everybody
worth
knowing
in
the
world
count
schouvaloff
russian
ambassador
in
london
a
polished
courtier
extremely
intelligent
he
and
were
colleagues
afterward
at
the
congrès
de
berlin
and
has
often
told
me
how
brilliantly
he
defended
his
cause
general
ignatieff
prince
orloff
the
nunzio
monsignor
czascki
quite
charming
the
type
of
the
prélat
mondain
very
large
though
very
catholic
in
his
ideas
but
never
aggressive
or
disagreeable
about
the
republic
as
so
many
of
the
clergy
were
he
was
very
fond
of
music
and
went
with
me
sometimes
to
the
conservatoire
on
sunday
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
the
way
they
played
classical
music
used
to
lean
back
in
his
chair
in
a
corner
would
never
sit
in
front
of
the
box
and
drink
in
every
sound
we
sometimes
had
informal
music
in
my
little
blue
salon
baron
de
zuylen
dutch
minister
was
an
excellent
musician
also
comte
de
beust
the
austrian
ambassador
he
was
a
composer
i
remember
his
playing
me
one
day
a
wedding
march
he
had
composed
for
the
marriage
of
one
of
the
archdukes
it
was
very
descriptive
with
bells
cannon
hurrahs
and
a
nuptial
hymn
rather
difficult
to
render
on
a
piano
but
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
imagination
in
the
composition
the
two
came
often
with
me
to
the
conservatoire
comte
de
beust
brought
liszt
to
me
one
day
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
that
complex
character
made
up
of
enthusiasms
of
all
kinds
patriotic
religious
musical
he
was
dressed
in
the
ordinary
black
priestly
garb
looked
like
an
ascetic
with
pale
thin
face
which
lighted
up
very
much
when
discussing
any
subject
that
interested
him
he
did
say
a
word
about
music
either
then
or
on
a
subsequent
occasion
when
i
lunched
with
him
at
the
house
of
a
great
friend
and
admirer
who
was
a
beautiful
musician
i
hoped
he
would
play
after
luncheon
he
was
a
very
old
man
and
played
rarely
in
those
days
but
one
would
have
liked
to
hear
him
madame
thought
he
would
perhaps
for
her
if
the
party
were
not
too
large
and
the
guests
sympathetic
to
him
i
have
heard
so
many
artists
say
it
made
all
the
difference
to
them
when
they
felt
the
public
was
with
them
if
there
were
one
unsympathetic
or
criticising
face
in
the
mass
of
people
it
was
the
only
face
they
could
distinguish
and
it
affected
them
very
much
the
piano
was
engagingly
open
and
music
littered
about
but
he
apparently
see
it
he
talked
politics
and
a
good
deal
about
pictures
with
some
artists
who
were
present
illustration
franz
liszt
i
did
hear
him
play
many
years
later
in
london
we
were
again
lunching
together
at
the
house
of
a
mutual
friend
who
was
not
at
all
musical
there
was
even
a
piano
in
the
house
but
she
had
one
brought
in
for
the
occasion
when
i
arrived
rather
early
the
day
of
the
party
i
found
the
mistress
of
the
house
aided
by
count
hatzfeldt
then
german
ambassador
to
england
busily
engaged
in
transforming
her
the
grand
piano
which
had
been
standing
well
out
toward
the
middle
of
the
room
open
with
music
on
it
i
dare
say
some
of
liszt
own
but
i
did
have
time
to
examine
was
being
pushed
back
into
a
corner
all
the
music
hidden
away
and
the
instrument
covered
with
photographs
vases
of
flowers
statuettes
heavy
books
all
the
things
one
habitually
put
on
pianos
i
was
quite
puzzled
but
hatzfeldt
who
was
a
great
friend
of
liszt
and
knew
all
his
peculiarities
when
consulted
by
madame
as
to
what
she
could
do
to
induce
liszt
to
play
had
answered
begin
by
putting
the
piano
in
the
furthest
darkest
corner
of
the
room
and
put
all
sorts
of
heavy
things
on
it
then
he
wo
think
you
have
asked
him
in
the
hope
of
hearing
him
play
and
perhaps
we
can
persuade
him
the
arrangements
were
just
finished
as
the
rest
of
the
company
arrived
we
were
not
a
large
party
and
the
talk
was
pleasant
enough
liszt
looked
much
older
so
colourless
his
skin
like
ivory
but
he
seemed
just
as
animated
and
interested
in
everything
after
luncheon
when
they
were
smoking
all
of
us
together
no
one
went
into
the
he
and
hatzfeldt
began
talking
about
the
empire
and
the
beautiful
fêtes
at
compiègne
where
anybody
of
any
distinction
in
any
branch
of
art
or
literature
was
invited
hatzfeldt
led
the
conversation
to
some
evenings
when
strauss
played
his
waltzes
with
an
entrain
a
sentiment
that
no
one
else
has
ever
attained
and
to
offenbach
and
his
melodies
one
evening
particularly
when
he
had
improvised
a
song
for
the
empress
he
could
quite
remember
it
if
there
were
a
piano
he
looked
about
there
was
none
apparently
oh
yes
in
a
corner
but
so
many
things
upon
it
it
was
evidently
never
meant
to
be
opened
he
moved
toward
it
liszt
following
asking
comtesse
if
it
could
be
opened
the
things
were
quickly
removed
hatzfeldt
sat
down
and
played
a
few
bars
in
rather
a
halting
fashion
after
a
moment
liszt
said
no
no
it
is
not
quite
that
hatzfeldt
got
up
liszt
seated
himself
at
the
piano
played
two
or
three
bits
of
songs
or
waltzes
then
always
talking
to
hatzfeldt
let
his
fingers
wander
over
the
keys
and
by
degrees
broke
into
a
nocturne
and
a
wild
hungarian
march
it
was
very
curious
his
fingers
looked
as
if
they
were
made
of
yellow
ivory
so
thin
and
long
and
of
course
there
any
strength
or
execution
in
his
playing
it
was
the
touch
of
an
old
man
but
a
master
quite
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
heard
when
he
got
up
he
said
oh
well
i
did
think
the
old
fingers
had
any
music
left
in
them
we
tried
to
thank
him
but
he
would
listen
to
us
immediately
talked
about
something
else
when
he
had
gone
we
complimented
the
ambassador
on
the
way
in
which
he
had
managed
the
thing
hatzfeldt
was
a
charming
colleague
very
clever
very
musical
a
thorough
man
of
the
world
i
was
always
pleased
when
he
was
next
to
me
at
dinner
i
was
sure
of
a
pleasant
hour
he
had
been
many
years
in
paris
during
the
brilliant
days
of
the
empire
knew
everybody
there
worth
knowing
he
had
the
reputation
notwithstanding
his
long
stay
in
paris
of
being
very
i
could
hardly
judge
of
that
as
he
never
talked
politics
to
me
it
may
very
likely
have
been
true
but
not
more
marked
with
him
than
with
the
generality
of
and
northern
races
who
rather
look
down
upon
the
latins
hardly
giving
them
credit
for
their
splendid
dash
and
pluck
to
say
nothing
of
their
brains
i
have
lived
in
a
great
many
countries
and
always
think
that
as
a
people
i
mean
the
uneducated
mass
the
french
are
the
most
intelligent
nation
in
the
world
i
have
never
been
thrown
with
the
japanese
am
told
they
are
extraordinarily
intelligent
we
had
a
dinner
one
night
for
gladstone
his
wife
and
a
daughter
gladstone
made
himself
quite
charming
spoke
french
fairly
well
and
knew
more
about
every
subject
discussed
than
any
one
else
in
the
room
he
was
certainly
a
wonderful
man
such
extraordinary
versatility
and
such
a
memory
it
was
rather
pretty
to
see
gladstone
when
her
husband
was
talking
she
was
quite
absorbed
by
him
could
talk
to
her
neighbours
they
wanted
very
much
to
go
to
the
conciergerie
to
see
the
prison
where
the
unfortunate
marie
antoinette
passed
the
last
days
of
her
unhappy
life
and
gladstone
inspired
by
the
subject
made
us
a
sort
of
conférence
on
the
french
revolution
and
the
causes
which
led
up
to
it
culminating
in
the
terror
and
the
execution
of
the
king
and
queen
he
spoke
in
english
we
were
a
little
group
standing
at
the
door
they
were
just
going
in
beautiful
academic
language
and
it
was
most
interesting
graphic
and
exact
even
who
knew
him
well
and
admired
him
immensely
was
struck
by
his
brilliant
improvisation
illustration
william
gladstone
from
a
photograph
by
samuel
walker
london
we
were
often
asked
for
permits
by
our
english
and
american
friends
to
see
all
the
places
of
historical
interest
in
paris
and
the
two
places
which
all
wanted
to
see
were
the
conciergerie
and
napoleon
tomb
at
the
invalides
when
we
first
came
to
paris
in
just
after
the
end
of
the
long
struggle
between
the
north
and
south
in
america
our
first
visits
too
were
for
the
conciergerie
invalides
and
notre
dame
where
my
father
had
not
been
since
he
had
gone
as
a
very
young
man
with
all
paris
to
see
the
flags
that
had
been
brought
back
from
austerlitz
they
were
interesting
days
those
first
ones
in
paris
so
full
of
memories
for
father
who
had
been
there
a
great
deal
in
his
young
days
first
as
an
élève
in
the
ecole
polytechnique
later
when
the
allies
were
in
paris
he
took
us
one
day
to
the
luxembourg
gardens
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
trace
of
the
spot
where
in
during
the
restoration
marshal
ney
had
been
shot
he
was
in
paris
at
the
time
and
was
in
the
garden
a
few
hours
after
the
execution
remembered
quite
well
the
wall
against
which
the
marshal
stood
and
the
comments
of
the
crowd
not
very
flattering
for
the
government
in
executing
one
of
france
bravest
and
most
brilliant
soldiers
all
the
americans
who
came
to
see
us
at
the
quai
were
much
interested
in
everything
relating
to
général
marquis
de
lafayette
who
left
an
undying
memory
in
america
and
many
pilgrimages
were
made
to
the
château
de
la
grange
where
the
marquis
de
lafayette
spent
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
extended
a
large
and
gracious
hospitality
to
all
his
friends
it
is
an
interesting
old
place
with
a
moat
all
around
it
and
high
solid
stone
walls
where
one
still
sees
the
hole
that
was
made
in
the
wall
by
a
sent
by
maréchal
de
turenne
as
he
was
passing
with
his
troops
as
a
friendly
souvenir
to
the
owner
with
whom
he
was
not
on
good
terms
so
many
americans
and
english
too
are
imbued
with
the
idea
that
there
are
no
châteaux
no
country
life
in
france
that
i
am
delighted
when
they
can
see
that
there
are
just
as
many
as
in
any
other
country
a
very
clever
american
writer
whose
books
have
been
much
read
and
admired
says
that
when
travelling
in
france
in
the
country
he
never
saw
any
signs
of
wealth
or
gentlemen
property
i
think
he
did
want
to
admire
anything
french
but
i
wonder
in
what
part
of
france
he
has
travelled
besides
the
historic
châteaux
of
chaumont
chenonceaux
maintenon
dampierre
josselin
valençay
and
scores
of
others
there
are
quantities
of
small
louis
xv
châteaux
and
manoirs
half
hidden
in
a
corner
of
a
forest
which
the
stranger
never
sees
they
are
quite
charming
built
of
red
brick
with
white
copings
with
stiff
gardens
and
trees
cut
into
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
sometimes
the
parish
church
touches
the
castle
on
one
side
and
there
is
a
private
entrance
for
the
seigneurs
the
interior
arrangements
in
some
of
the
old
ones
leave
much
to
be
desired
in
the
way
of
comfort
and
modern
improvements
lighting
very
bad
neither
gas
nor
electricity
and
i
should
think
no
baths
anywhere
hardly
a
tub
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
and
the
loire
near
the
great
forests
in
all
the
departments
near
paris
there
are
quantities
of
châteaux
some
just
on
the
border
of
the
highroad
separated
from
it
by
high
iron
gates
through
which
one
sees
long
winding
alleys
with
stone
benches
and
vases
with
red
geraniums
planted
in
them
a
and
stiff
formal
rows
of
trees
some
less
pretentious
with
merely
an
ordinary
wooden
gate
generally
open
and
always
flowers
of
the
simplest
kind
geraniums
sunflowers
pinks
dahlias
and
chrysanthemums
what
we
call
a
jardin
de
curé
garden
but
in
great
abundance
with
very
rare
exceptions
the
lawns
are
not
well
kept
one
never
sees
in
this
country
the
smooth
green
turf
that
one
does
in
england
some
of
the
old
châteaux
are
very
stately
sometimes
one
enters
by
a
large
quadrangle
quite
surrounded
by
low
arcades
covered
with
ivy
a
fountain
and
basin
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
and
a
big
clock
over
the
door
sometimes
they
stand
in
a
moat
one
goes
over
a
drawbridge
with
massive
doors
studded
with
iron
nails
and
strong
iron
bolts
and
chains
which
defend
the
entrance
making
one
think
of
old
feudal
days
when
might
was
right
and
if
a
man
wanted
his
neighbours
property
he
simply
took
it
even
some
of
the
smaller
châteaux
have
moats
i
think
they
are
more
picturesque
than
comfortable
an
house
with
a
moat
around
it
is
a
nest
for
mosquitoes
and
insects
of
all
kinds
and
i
fancy
the
damp
from
the
water
must
finish
by
pervading
the
house
french
people
of
all
classes
love
the
country
and
a
garden
with
bright
flowers
and
if
the
poorer
ones
can
combine
a
rabbit
hutch
with
the
flowers
they
are
quite
happy
i
have
heard
speak
sometimes
of
a
fine
old
château
in
our
department
aisne
belonging
to
a
deputy
who
invited
his
friends
to
shoot
and
breakfast
the
cuisine
and
shooting
were
excellent
but
the
accommodations
fantastic
the
neighbours
said
nothing
had
been
renewed
or
cleaned
since
the
château
was
occupied
by
the
cossacks
under
the
first
napoleon
we
got
very
little
country
life
during
those
years
at
the
foreign
office
twice
a
year
in
april
and
august
went
to
laon
for
his
over
which
he
presided
but
he
was
rarely
able
to
stay
all
through
the
session
he
was
always
present
on
the
opening
day
and
at
the
préfet
dinner
and
took
that
opportunity
to
make
a
short
speech
explaining
the
foreign
policy
of
the
government
i
do
think
it
interested
his
colleagues
as
much
as
all
the
local
questions
roads
schools
etc
it
is
astonishing
how
much
time
is
wasted
and
how
much
is
necessitated
by
the
simplest
change
in
a
road
or
railway
crossing
in
france
we
had
rather
a
short
narrow
turning
to
get
into
our
gate
at
bourneville
and
wanted
to
have
the
road
enlarged
just
a
little
so
as
to
avoid
the
sharp
angle
it
did
interfere
with
any
one
as
we
were
several
yards
from
the
highroad
but
it
was
months
more
than
a
year
before
the
thing
was
done
any
one
of
the
workmen
on
the
farm
would
have
finished
it
in
a
day
work
at
one
of
our
small
dinners
i
had
such
a
characteristic
answer
from
an
english
diplomatist
who
had
been
ambassador
at
petersburg
he
was
really
a
charming
talker
but
would
speak
french
that
was
of
no
consequence
as
long
as
he
only
talked
to
me
but
naturally
all
the
people
at
the
table
wanted
to
talk
to
him
and
when
the
general
conversation
languished
at
last
i
said
to
him
i
wish
you
would
speak
french
none
of
these
gentlemen
speak
any
other
language
it
was
quite
true
the
men
of
my
husband
age
spoke
very
rarely
any
other
language
but
their
own
now
almost
all
the
younger
generation
speak
german
or
english
or
both
almost
all
my
son
friends
speak
english
perfectly
oh
no
i
ca
he
said
i
have
enough
the
habit
of
speaking
french
i
do
say
the
things
i
want
to
say
only
the
things
i
can
say
which
is
very
different
but
what
did
you
do
in
russia
all
the
women
speak
english
but
for
affairs
diplomatic
negotiations
all
the
women
speak
english
i
have
often
heard
it
said
that
the
russian
women
were
much
more
clever
than
the
men
he
evidently
had
found
it
true
vi
the
exposition
year
the
big
political
dinners
were
always
interesting
on
one
occasion
we
had
a
banquet
on
the
of
december
my
neighbour
a
senator
said
to
me
casually
this
room
looks
very
different
from
what
it
did
the
last
time
i
was
in
it
does
it
i
should
have
thought
a
big
official
dinner
at
the
foreign
office
would
have
been
precisely
the
same
under
any
régime
a
dinner
perhaps
but
on
that
occasion
we
were
not
precisely
dining
i
and
a
number
of
my
friends
had
just
been
arrested
and
we
were
waiting
here
in
this
room
strictly
guarded
until
it
was
decided
what
should
be
done
with
us
then
i
remembered
that
it
was
the
of
december
the
anniversary
of
louis
napoléon
coup
he
said
they
were
quite
unprepared
for
it
in
spite
of
warnings
he
was
sent
out
of
the
country
for
a
little
while
but
i
do
think
his
exile
was
a
very
terrible
one
i
got
my
first
lesson
in
diplomatic
politeness
from
lord
lyons
then
british
ambassador
in
paris
he
was
in
paris
during
the
war
knew
everybody
and
had
a
great
position
he
gave
very
handsome
dinners
liked
his
guests
to
be
punctual
was
very
punctual
himself
always
arrived
on
the
stroke
of
eight
when
he
dined
with
us
we
had
an
annamite
mission
to
dine
one
night
and
had
invited
almost
all
the
ambassadors
and
ministers
to
meet
them
there
had
been
a
stormy
sitting
at
the
chamber
and
was
late
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
i
went
to
his
library
and
waited
for
him
i
could
go
down
and
receive
a
foreign
mission
without
him
we
were
quite
seven
or
eight
minutes
late
and
found
all
the
company
assembled
except
the
annamites
who
were
waiting
with
their
interpreter
in
another
room
to
make
their
entry
in
proper
style
as
i
shook
hands
with
lord
lyons
who
was
doyen
of
the
diplomatic
corps
he
said
to
me
ah
madame
waddington
i
see
the
republic
is
becoming
very
royal
you
do
receive
your
guests
any
more
merely
come
into
the
room
when
all
the
company
is
assembled
he
said
it
quite
smilingly
but
i
understood
very
well
and
of
course
we
ought
to
have
been
there
when
the
first
guests
arrived
he
was
very
amiable
all
the
same
and
told
me
a
great
many
useful
things
for
instance
that
i
must
never
invite
a
cardinal
and
an
ambassador
together
as
neither
of
them
would
yield
the
precedence
and
i
would
find
myself
in
a
very
awkward
position
illustration
lord
lyons
the
annamites
were
something
awful
to
see
in
their
country
all
the
men
of
a
certain
standing
blacken
their
teeth
and
i
suppose
the
dye
makes
their
teeth
fall
out
as
they
had
any
apparently
and
when
they
opened
their
mouths
the
black
caverns
one
saw
were
terrifying
i
had
been
warned
but
notwithstanding
it
made
a
most
disagreeable
impression
on
me
they
were
very
richly
attired
particularly
the
first
three
who
were
très
grands
seigneurs
in
annam
heavily
embroidered
silk
robes
feathers
and
jewels
and
when
they
did
open
their
mouths
they
were
rather
a
decorative
group
were
tall
powerfully
built
men
they
knew
no
french
nor
english
spoke
through
the
interpreter
my
intercourse
with
them
was
very
limited
they
were
not
near
me
at
dinner
but
afterward
i
tried
to
talk
to
them
a
little
they
all
stood
in
a
group
at
one
end
of
the
room
flanked
by
an
interpreter
the
three
principal
chiefs
well
in
front
i
do
know
what
the
interpreter
said
to
them
from
me
probably
embellished
my
very
banal
remarks
with
flowers
of
rhetoric
but
they
were
very
smiling
opening
wide
their
black
mouths
and
made
me
very
low
bows
evidently
appreciated
my
intention
and
effort
to
be
amiable
they
brought
us
presents
carpets
carved
and
inlaid
boxes
cabinets
and
some
curious
saddles
also
cushions
and
slippers
some
arab
horses
were
announced
with
great
pomp
from
the
sultan
stables
i
was
rather
interested
in
them
thought
it
would
be
amusing
to
drive
a
arab
pony
in
a
little
cart
in
the
morning
they
were
brought
one
morning
to
the
quai
and
gave
rendezvous
to
comte
de
pontécoulant
and
some
of
the
sporting
men
of
the
cabinet
in
the
courtyard
there
were
also
several
stablemen
all
much
interested
in
the
idea
of
taming
the
fiery
steeds
of
the
desert
the
first
look
was
disappointing
they
were
thin
scraggy
animals
apparently
all
legs
and
manes
long
tails
they
had
and
small
heads
but
anything
so
tame
and
sluggish
in
their
movements
could
hardly
be
imagined
one
could
scarcely
get
them
to
canter
around
the
courtyard
we
were
all
rather
disgusted
as
sometimes
one
sees
pretty
little
arab
horses
in
paris
i
do
know
what
became
of
them
i
fancy
they
were
sent
to
the
cavalry
stables
our
first
great
function
that
winter
was
the
service
at
the
madeleine
for
the
king
of
italy
victor
emmanuel
who
died
suddenly
in
the
beginning
of
january
france
sent
a
special
mission
to
the
funeral
the
old
marshal
canrobert
who
took
with
him
the
marshal
son
fabrice
de
macmahon
the
church
of
the
madeleine
was
filled
with
people
of
all
kinds
the
diplomatic
corps
in
uniform
a
very
large
representation
of
senators
and
deputies
there
was
a
slight
hesitation
among
some
of
the
left
who
were
ardent
sympathisers
with
young
italy
but
who
did
care
to
compromise
themselves
by
taking
part
in
a
religious
ceremony
however
as
a
rule
they
went
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
right
were
rather
put
out
at
having
to
go
in
deep
mourning
to
the
service
i
said
to
one
of
them
but
you
are
not
correct
you
have
a
black
dress
certainly
but
i
do
think
gloves
are
proper
for
such
an
occasion
oh
they
express
quite
sufficiently
the
grief
i
feel
on
this
occasion
it
was
curious
that
the
king
should
have
gone
before
the
old
pope
who
had
been
failing
for
some
time
every
day
we
expected
to
hear
of
his
death
there
were
many
speculations
over
the
new
king
of
italy
the
prince
humbert
of
our
day
as
we
had
lived
so
many
years
in
rome
i
was
often
asked
what
he
was
like
but
i
really
had
no
opinion
one
saw
him
very
little
i
remember
one
day
in
the
he
got
a
nasty
fall
his
horse
put
his
foot
in
a
hole
and
fell
with
him
it
looked
a
bad
accident
as
if
the
horse
were
going
to
roll
over
on
him
i
with
one
of
my
friends
was
near
and
seeing
an
accident
i
did
know
who
it
was
naturally
stopped
to
see
if
our
groom
could
do
anything
but
an
officer
rode
hurriedly
up
and
begged
us
to
go
on
that
the
prince
would
be
very
much
annoyed
if
any
one
particularly
a
woman
should
notice
his
fall
i
saw
him
later
in
the
day
looking
all
right
on
another
horse
and
no
one
made
any
allusion
to
the
accident
about
a
month
after
victor
emmanuel
death
the
old
pope
died
the
of
february
quite
suddenly
at
the
end
he
was
buried
of
course
in
rome
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
arrange
for
his
funeral
in
the
rome
of
the
king
of
italy
however
he
did
lie
in
state
at
peter
the
noble
garde
in
their
splendid
uniforms
standing
close
around
the
catafalque
long
lines
of
italian
soldiers
the
bersaglieri
with
their
waving
plumes
on
each
side
of
the
great
aisle
there
was
a
magnificent
service
for
him
at
notre
dame
the
chambers
raised
their
sitting
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
the
head
of
the
church
and
again
there
was
a
great
attendance
at
the
cathedral
there
were
many
discussions
in
the
monde
society
not
official
as
to
whether
one
should
wear
mourning
for
the
saint
père
i
believe
the
correct
thing
is
not
to
wear
mourning
but
almost
all
the
ladies
of
the
faubourg
germain
went
about
in
black
garments
for
some
time
one
of
my
friends
put
it
rather
graphically
si
on
a
un
ruban
rose
dans
les
cheveux
on
a
tout
de
suite
la
maîtresse
de
rochefort
all
europe
was
engrossed
with
the
question
of
the
pope
successor
intrigues
and
undercurrents
were
going
on
hard
in
rome
and
the
issue
of
the
conclave
was
impatiently
awaited
no
one
could
predict
any
result
the
election
of
cardinal
pecci
future
leo
xiii
seemed
satisfactory
at
least
in
the
beginning
my
winter
passed
pleasantly
enough
i
began
to
feel
more
at
home
in
my
new
quarters
and
saw
many
interesting
people
of
all
kinds
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
very
lively
debate
in
the
parliament
would
come
home
very
late
saying
things
could
go
on
like
that
and
we
would
surely
be
out
of
office
in
a
few
weeks
we
always
kept
our
house
in
the
rue
dumont
and
i
went
over
every
week
often
thinking
that
in
a
few
days
we
should
be
back
there
again
one
of
my
great
trials
was
a
reception
day
thought
i
ought
to
have
one
so
every
friday
i
was
at
home
from
three
until
six
and
very
long
afternoons
they
were
i
insisted
upon
having
a
which
was
a
novelty
in
those
days
but
it
broke
the
stiff
semicircle
of
red
and
gold
armchairs
carefully
arranged
at
one
end
of
the
room
very
few
men
took
tea
it
was
rather
amusing
to
see
some
of
the
deputies
who
exactly
like
to
refuse
a
cup
of
tea
offered
to
them
by
the
wife
holding
the
cup
and
saucer
most
carefully
in
their
hands
making
a
pretence
of
sipping
the
tea
and
replacing
it
hastily
on
the
table
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
i
had
of
course
a
great
many
people
of
different
nationalities
who
generally
did
know
each
other
the
ambassadresses
and
ministers
wives
sat
on
each
side
of
my
sofa
the
smaller
people
lower
down
they
were
all
announced
my
huissier
gérard
doing
it
very
well
opening
the
big
doors
and
roaring
out
the
names
sometimes
at
the
end
of
the
day
some
of
my
own
friends
or
some
of
the
young
men
from
the
chancery
would
come
in
and
that
would
cheer
me
up
a
little
there
was
no
conversation
merely
an
exchange
of
formal
phrases
but
i
had
some
funny
experiences
one
day
i
had
several
ladies
whom
i
did
know
at
all
wives
of
deputies
or
small
functionaries
at
some
of
the
ministries
one
of
my
friends
comtesse
de
was
starting
for
italy
and
rome
for
the
first
time
she
had
come
to
ask
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
clothes
hotels
people
to
see
etc
when
she
went
away
in
a
whirl
of
preparations
and
addresses
i
turned
to
one
of
my
neighbours
saying
je
crois
est
très
bien
à
de
londres
à
rome
quite
an
insignificant
and
inoffensive
remark
merely
to
say
something
she
replied
haughtily
je
sais
rien
madame
je
jamais
quitté
paris
et
je
vante
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
had
nothing
to
say
but
was
afterward
sorry
that
i
had
not
continued
the
conversation
and
asked
her
why
she
was
so
especially
proud
of
never
having
left
paris
travelling
is
usually
supposed
to
enlarge
one
ideas
her
answer
might
have
been
interesting
would
believe
it
when
i
told
him
but
i
said
i
could
really
have
invented
it
i
used
to
go
into
his
cabinet
at
the
end
of
the
day
always
when
he
was
alone
with
pontécoulant
and
tell
them
all
my
experiences
which
forbid
me
to
mention
anywhere
else
i
had
a
good
many
surprises
but
soon
learned
never
to
be
astonished
and
to
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
the
great
interest
of
the
summer
was
the
exposition
universelle
which
was
to
take
place
at
the
trocadéro
the
new
building
which
had
been
built
on
the
champ
de
mars
the
opening
was
announced
for
the
of
may
and
was
to
be
performed
with
great
pomp
by
the
marshal
all
europe
was
represented
except
germany
and
almost
all
the
great
powers
were
sending
princes
to
represent
their
country
we
went
often
to
see
how
the
works
were
getting
on
and
i
must
say
it
did
look
as
if
it
could
possibly
be
ready
for
the
of
may
there
were
armies
of
workmen
in
every
direction
and
carts
and
camions
loaded
with
cases
making
their
way
with
difficulty
through
the
mud
occasionally
a
light
case
or
bale
would
fall
off
and
quantities
of
small
boys
who
seemed
always
on
the
spot
would
precipitate
themselves
tumbling
over
each
other
to
pick
up
what
fell
and
there
would
be
protestations
and
explanations
in
every
language
under
the
sun
it
was
a
motley
picturesque
crowd
the
costumes
and
uniforms
making
so
much
colour
in
the
midst
of
the
very
ordinary
dark
clothes
the
civilised
western
world
affects
i
felt
sorry
for
the
orientals
and
people
from
milder
climes
they
looked
so
miserably
cold
and
wretched
shivering
under
the
very
fresh
april
breezes
that
swept
over
the
great
plain
of
the
champ
de
mars
the
machines
particularly
the
american
ones
attracted
great
attention
there
was
always
a
crowd
waiting
when
some
of
the
large
pieces
were
swung
down
into
their
places
by
enormous
pulleys
the
opening
ceremony
was
very
brilliant
happily
it
was
a
beautiful
warm
day
as
all
the
guests
invited
by
the
marshal
and
the
government
were
seated
on
a
platform
outside
the
trocadéro
building
all
the
diplomatic
corps
foreign
royalties
and
commissioners
of
the
different
nations
who
were
taking
part
in
the
exposition
were
invited
the
view
was
lovely
as
we
looked
down
from
our
seats
the
great
enclosure
was
packed
with
people
all
the
pavilions
looked
very
gay
with
walls
and
turrets
and
there
were
flags
palms
flowers
and
fountains
everywhere
the
seine
running
through
the
middle
with
fanciful
bridges
and
boats
there
was
a
curious
collection
of
people
in
the
tribunes
the
invitations
had
not
been
very
easy
to
make
there
were
three
spanish
sovereigns
queen
isabella
her
husband
don
françois
and
the
duc
king
amadée
who
had
reigned
a
few
stormy
months
in
spain
he
had
come
to
represent
italy
at
the
exposition
the
marshal
was
rather
preoccupied
with
his
spanish
royalties
he
had
a
reception
in
the
evening
to
which
all
were
invited
and
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
take
certain
precautions
so
he
sent
one
of
his
to
queen
isabella
to
say
that
he
hoped
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her
in
the
evening
at
the
elysée
but
he
thought
it
right
to
tell
her
that
she
might
perhaps
have
some
disagreeable
meetings
she
replied
si
mon
mari
de
qui
vous
parlez
cela
tout
à
fait
égal
si
le
duc
je
serai
ravie
de
le
voir
she
came
to
the
reception
but
her
husband
was
already
gone
the
due
was
still
there
and
she
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
for
the
duke
was
not
at
all
the
type
of
the
gay
lady
man
very
much
the
reverse
he
looked
a
soldier
like
all
the
princes
of
the
house
of
savoy
and
at
the
same
time
a
monk
one
could
easily
imagine
him
a
crusader
in
plumed
helmet
and
breastplate
supporting
any
privation
or
fatigue
without
a
murmur
he
was
very
shy
one
saw
it
was
an
effort
for
him
every
time
that
any
one
was
brought
up
to
him
and
he
had
to
make
polite
phrases
not
in
the
least
mondain
but
simple
charming
when
one
talked
to
him
i
saw
him
often
afterward
as
he
represented
his
brother
king
humbert
on
various
official
occasions
when
i
too
was
present
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
alexander
of
russia
the
jubilee
of
queen
victoria
he
was
always
a
striking
figure
did
look
as
if
he
belonged
to
our
modern
world
at
all
the
marshal
had
a
series
of
dinners
and
receptions
which
were
most
brilliant
there
was
almost
always
music
or
theatricals
with
the
best
artists
in
paris
the
comédie
française
was
much
appreciated
their
style
is
so
finished
and
sure
they
played
just
as
well
at
one
end
of
a
with
a
rampe
of
flowers
only
separating
them
from
the
public
as
in
their
own
theatre
with
all
the
help
of
scenery
acoustics
and
distance
in
a
naturally
the
audience
is
much
nearer
i
remember
one
charming
party
at
the
elysée
for
the
austrian
crown
prince
the
unfortunate
archduke
rudolph
all
the
stars
of
the
théâtre
français
were
playing
croizette
reichemberg
delaunay
coquelin
the
prince
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
he
was
very
with
a
slight
elegant
figure
and
charming
smile
did
look
like
a
man
whose
life
would
end
so
tragically
when
i
saw
him
some
years
later
in
london
he
was
changed
looked
older
had
lost
his
gaiety
was
evidently
bored
with
the
official
entertaining
and
used
to
escape
from
all
the
dinners
and
receptions
as
soon
as
he
could
the
late
king
edward
then
prince
of
wales
won
golden
opinions
always
there
was
certainly
something
in
his
personality
which
had
an
enormous
attraction
for
parisians
he
always
seemed
to
enjoy
life
never
looked
bored
was
unfailingly
courteous
and
interested
in
the
people
he
was
talking
to
it
was
a
joy
to
the
french
people
to
see
him
at
some
of
the
small
theatres
amusing
himself
and
understanding
all
the
and
argot
quite
as
well
as
they
did
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
what
some
one
said
were
true
that
he
reminded
them
of
their
beloved
henri
iv
who
still
lives
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
his
the
prince
of
denmark
was
also
most
amiable
we
met
him
often
walking
about
the
streets
with
one
or
two
of
his
gentlemen
and
looking
in
at
the
windows
like
an
ordinary
provincial
he
was
tall
with
a
slight
youthful
figure
and
was
always
recognised
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
and
pride
to
parisians
to
have
so
many
royalties
and
distinguished
people
among
them
again
those
two
months
of
may
and
june
gave
back
to
paris
the
animation
and
gaiety
of
the
last
days
of
the
empire
there
were
many
handsome
carriages
on
the
filled
with
pretty
women
and
the
opera
and
all
the
theatres
were
packed
paris
was
illuminated
the
night
of
the
opening
of
the
exposition
the
whole
city
not
merely
the
and
boulevards
as
we
drove
across
the
bridge
on
our
way
home
from
the
reception
at
the
elysée
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
the
streets
full
of
people
waiting
to
see
the
foreign
royalties
pass
and
the
view
up
and
down
the
seine
with
the
lights
from
the
high
buildings
reflected
in
the
water
like
illustration
his
royal
highness
edward
prince
of
wales
in
from
a
photograph
by
lock
whitfield
london
the
dinners
and
receptions
at
the
elysée
and
at
all
the
ministries
those
first
weeks
of
the
exposition
were
interesting
but
so
fatiguing
happily
there
were
not
many
lunches
nor
day
entertainments
i
used
to
get
a
good
drive
every
afternoon
in
the
open
carriage
with
mother
and
baby
and
that
kept
me
alive
occasionally
not
often
had
a
man
dinner
and
then
i
could
go
with
some
of
my
friends
and
dine
at
the
exposition
which
was
very
amusing
such
a
curious
collection
of
people
the
rue
des
nations
was
like
a
gigantic
fair
we
met
all
our
friends
and
heard
every
language
under
the
sun
among
other
distinguished
foreign
guests
that
year
we
had
president
and
grant
who
were
received
everywhere
in
europe
england
giving
the
example
like
royalties
when
they
dined
with
us
at
the
quai
and
i
went
to
the
top
of
the
great
staircase
to
meet
them
exactly
as
we
did
for
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
it
seems
funny
to
me
when
i
think
of
the
very
unceremonious
manner
in
which
not
only
but
actual
presidents
were
treated
in
america
when
i
was
a
child
i
remember
quite
well
seeing
a
president
i
have
forgotten
which
one
now
come
into
the
big
at
the
old
cozzen
hotel
at
west
point
with
two
or
three
gentlemen
with
him
there
was
a
certain
number
of
people
in
the
room
and
nobody
moved
or
dreamt
of
getting
up
however
the
grants
were
very
simple
accepted
all
the
honours
shown
to
them
without
a
pose
of
any
kind
the
marshal
gave
them
a
big
dinner
at
the
elysée
we
arrived
a
little
late
we
always
did
and
found
a
large
party
assembled
the
grants
came
in
just
after
us
the
maréchale
said
to
me
the
chinese
ambassador
will
take
you
to
dinner
madame
waddington
he
is
an
interesting
clever
man
knows
england
and
the
english
well
speaks
english
remarkably
well
just
before
dinner
was
announced
the
ambassador
was
brought
up
to
me
he
was
a
man
tall
dignified
very
gorgeously
attired
in
satin
embroidered
in
flowers
and
gold
and
silver
designs
and
a
splendid
yellow
bird
of
paradise
in
his
cap
he
did
come
quite
up
to
me
made
me
a
low
bow
from
a
certain
distance
and
then
fell
back
into
a
group
of
smaller
satellites
all
very
splendidly
dressed
when
dinner
was
announced
the
first
couples
filed
off
the
marshal
with
grant
and
the
maréchale
with
president
grant
and
with
his
lady
there
was
a
pause
i
should
have
gone
next
but
my
ambassador
was
forthcoming
i
looked
and
wondered
all
the
were
making
frantic
signals
to
me
to
go
on
and
the
whole
cortège
was
stopped
i
really
did
know
what
to
do
i
felt
rather
foolish
presently
the
ambassador
appeared
offer
me
his
arm
but
again
made
me
a
low
bow
which
i
returned
and
moved
a
few
steps
forward
he
advanced
too
and
we
made
a
stately
progress
to
the
side
by
side
i
heard
afterward
the
explanation
it
seemed
that
in
those
days
things
have
changed
i
fancy
no
chinese
of
rank
would
touch
any
woman
who
did
belong
to
him
and
the
ambassador
would
have
thought
himself
dishonoured
as
well
as
me
if
he
had
offered
me
his
arm
the
dinner
was
anything
but
banal
when
we
finally
got
to
the
table
i
found
myself
on
the
left
grant
was
on
his
right
the
marshal
neither
spoke
nor
understood
english
grant
spoke
no
french
so
the
conversation
did
seem
likely
to
be
very
animated
after
a
few
moments
grant
naturally
wished
to
say
something
to
her
host
and
she
addressed
him
in
english
president
i
am
so
happy
to
be
in
your
beautiful
country
then
the
marshal
to
me
madame
waddington
je
vous
en
prie
dites
à
madame
grant
que
je
ne
puis
pas
répondre
je
ne
comprends
pas
je
ne
puis
pas
parler
avec
elle
grant
the
marshal
begs
me
to
say
to
you
that
he
regrets
not
being
able
to
talk
with
you
but
unfortunately
he
does
not
understand
english
then
there
was
a
pause
and
grant
began
again
what
a
beautiful
palace
president
it
must
be
delightful
with
that
charming
garden
again
the
marshal
to
me
mais
je
vous
en
prie
madame
dites
à
madame
grant
que
je
ne
puis
pas
causer
avec
elle
il
ne
faut
pas
me
parle
je
ne
comprends
pas
grant
the
marshal
is
distressed
that
he
can
not
talk
to
you
but
he
does
not
understand
any
english
it
was
very
trying
for
grant
happily
her
other
neighbour
knew
a
little
english
and
she
could
talk
to
him
but
all
through
dinner
at
intervals
she
began
again
at
the
marshal
after
a
few
moments
i
turned
my
attention
to
my
ambassador
i
had
been
looking
at
him
furtively
while
i
was
interpreting
for
the
marshal
and
grant
i
saw
that
he
everything
that
was
offered
to
him
dishes
wines
sauces
but
he
never
attacked
anything
without
waiting
to
see
what
his
neighbours
did
when
and
how
they
used
their
knives
and
forks
then
did
exactly
as
they
did
never
made
a
mistake
i
saw
he
was
looking
at
the
flowers
on
the
table
which
were
very
well
arranged
so
i
said
to
him
speaking
very
slowly
and
distinctly
as
one
does
to
a
child
or
a
deaf
person
have
you
pretty
flowers
in
your
country
he
replied
promptly
yes
yes
very
hot
very
cold
very
hot
very
cold
i
was
a
little
disconcerted
but
thought
i
had
perhaps
spoken
indistinctly
and
after
a
little
while
i
made
another
attempt
how
much
the
uniforms
add
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
fête
and
the
chinese
dress
is
particularly
striking
and
handsome
but
to
that
he
made
such
a
perfectly
unintelligible
answer
that
i
refrained
from
any
further
conversation
and
merely
smiled
at
him
from
time
to
time
which
he
always
acknowledged
with
a
little
bow
we
went
back
to
the
salons
in
the
same
way
side
by
side
and
when
the
men
had
gone
into
one
of
the
other
rooms
to
talk
and
smoke
i
went
to
speak
to
the
maréchale
who
said
to
me
i
am
sure
you
had
a
delightful
dinner
madame
waddington
the
chinese
ambassador
is
such
a
clever
man
has
travelled
a
great
deal
and
speaks
such
wonderful
english
wonderful
indeed
madame
la
maréchale
and
then
i
repeated
our
conversation
which
she
could
hardly
believe
and
which
amused
her
very
much
she
spoke
english
as
well
as
i
did
the
grants
were
very
much
entertained
during
their
stay
in
paris
and
we
met
them
nearly
every
night
liked
the
general
very
much
and
found
him
quite
talkative
when
he
was
alone
with
him
at
the
big
dinners
he
was
of
course
at
a
disadvantage
neither
speaking
nor
understanding
a
word
of
french
acted
as
interpreter
and
found
that
very
fatiguing
there
is
so
much
repartee
and
in
all
french
conversation
that
even
foreigners
who
know
the
language
well
find
it
sometimes
difficult
to
follow
everything
and
to
translate
quickly
enough
to
keep
one
au
courant
is
almost
impossible
when
they
could
they
drifted
into
english
and
said
he
was
most
interesting
speaking
of
the
war
and
all
the
north
had
done
without
ever
putting
himself
forward
we
had
both
of
us
often
to
act
as
interpreters
with
french
and
neither
understanding
the
other
language
and
always
found
it
difficult
i
remember
a
dinner
at
sandringham
some
years
ago
when
was
at
the
embassy
the
prince
of
wales
late
king
edward
asked
me
to
sit
next
to
a
foreign
ambassador
who
understood
not
one
word
of
english
the
dinner
was
exclusively
english
a
great
many
clever
men
the
master
of
trinity
college
cambridge
asked
especially
to
meet
my
husband
who
graduated
from
trinity
college
lord
goschen
james
knowles
of
the
froude
the
historian
sir
henry
james
lord
wolseley
etc
the
talk
was
very
animated
very
witty
there
were
peals
of
laughter
all
around
the
table
my
ambassador
was
very
fidgety
and
nervous
appealing
to
me
all
the
time
but
by
the
time
i
had
laboriously
condensed
and
translated
some
of
the
remarks
they
were
talking
of
something
quite
different
and
i
am
afraid
he
had
very
hazy
ideas
as
to
what
they
were
all
saying
we
saw
naturally
all
the
distinguished
strangers
who
passed
through
paris
that
year
of
many
of
our
colleagues
in
the
diplomatic
corps
had
played
a
great
rôle
in
their
own
country
prince
orloff
the
russian
ambassador
was
one
of
our
great
friends
he
gave
us
very
good
advice
on
one
or
two
occasions
he
was
a
man
always
wore
a
black
patch
over
one
eye
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
crimea
he
spoke
english
as
well
as
i
did
and
was
a
charming
talker
general
cialdini
was
at
the
italian
embassy
he
was
more
of
a
soldier
than
a
statesman
had
contributed
very
successfully
to
the
formation
of
united
italy
and
the
suppression
of
the
pope
temporal
power
and
was
naturally
not
exactly
persona
grata
to
the
catholics
in
france
prince
and
princess
hohenlohe
had
succeeded
arnim
at
the
german
embassy
their
beginnings
were
difficult
as
their
predecessor
had
done
nothing
to
make
the
germans
popular
in
france
but
their
strong
personality
tact
and
understanding
of
the
very
delicate
position
helped
them
enormously
they
were
catholics
the
princess
born
a
russian
her
brother
prince
wittgenstein
military
attaché
at
the
russian
embassy
and
very
big
people
in
their
own
country
so
absolutely
sure
of
themselves
and
their
position
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
slight
them
in
any
way
they
would
never
have
perceived
it
unless
some
extraordinary
rudeness
were
shown
the
princess
was
very
tall
with
a
good
figure
and
splendid
jewels
when
she
was
in
full
dress
for
a
ball
or
official
reception
she
wore
three
necklaces
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
a
big
handsome
high
tiara
which
added
to
her
height
she
was
the
only
lady
of
the
diplomatic
corps
whom
madame
grévy
ever
recognised
in
the
first
weeks
of
her
husband
presidency
madame
grevy
was
thrown
suddenly
not
very
young
into
such
an
absolutely
new
milieu
that
she
was
quite
bewildered
and
could
be
expected
to
recognise
half
the
women
of
the
diplomatic
corps
but
the
german
ambassadress
impressed
her
and
she
knew
her
always
the
princess
was
not
very
mondaine
did
care
about
society
and
life
in
a
city
preferred
the
country
with
riding
and
shooting
and
any
sort
of
sport
we
had
a
very
handsome
dinner
at
the
german
embassy
the
winter
of
given
to
the
marshal
and
madame
de
macmahon
after
dinner
with
coffee
a
bear
made
its
appearance
in
the
a
baby
bear
they
said
but
i
did
think
it
looked
very
small
the
princess
patted
it
and
talked
to
it
just
as
if
it
were
a
dog
and
i
must
say
the
little
animal
was
perfectly
quiet
and
kept
close
to
her
i
think
the
lights
and
the
quantity
of
people
frightened
it
it
growled
once
or
twice
and
we
all
had
a
feeling
of
relief
when
it
was
taken
away
i
asked
the
maréchale
afterward
if
she
were
afraid
oui
très
peur
mais
je
ne
voulais
pas
le
montrer
devant
ces
allemands
yes
i
was
very
frightened
but
i
would
not
show
it
before
those
germans
they
had
eventually
to
send
the
bear
away
back
to
germany
it
grew
wilder
as
it
grew
older
and
became
quite
unmanageable
they
could
keep
it
in
the
embassy
hohenlohe
was
always
pleasant
and
easy
i
think
he
had
a
real
sympathy
for
france
and
did
his
best
on
various
delicate
occasions
the
year
of
the
exposition
we
dined
out
every
night
and
almost
always
with
the
same
people
hohenlohe
often
fell
to
me
he
took
me
in
to
dinner
ten
times
in
succession
the
eleventh
time
we
were
each
of
us
in
despair
as
we
filed
out
together
so
i
said
to
him
do
let
us
even
pretend
to
talk
you
can
talk
to
your
other
neighbour
and
i
will
to
mine
however
we
talk
chiffons
curiously
enough
i
had
waited
for
a
dress
which
only
came
home
at
the
last
moment
and
when
i
put
it
on
the
corsage
was
so
tight
i
could
hardly
bear
it
it
was
too
late
to
change
and
i
had
nothing
else
ready
so
most
uncomfortable
i
started
for
my
dinner
i
did
dare
to
eat
anything
hardly
dared
move
which
hohenlohe
remarked
after
seeing
three
or
four
dishes
pass
me
untouched
and
said
to
me
i
am
afraid
you
are
ill
you
are
eating
nothing
no
not
at
all
only
very
uncomfortable
and
then
i
explained
the
situation
to
him
that
my
dress
was
so
tight
i
could
neither
move
nor
eat
he
was
most
indignant
how
could
women
be
so
foolish
why
did
we
want
to
have
abnormally
small
waists
and
be
slaves
to
our
dressmakers
men
did
like
figures
oh
yes
they
do
all
men
admire
a
slight
graceful
figure
yes
when
it
is
natural
but
no
man
understands
nor
cares
about
a
fashionably
dressed
woman
women
dress
for
each
other
which
is
perfectly
true
illustration
prince
hohenlohe
after
the
painting
by
laszlo
however
he
was
destined
to
see
other
ladies
very
careful
about
their
figures
the
late
empress
of
austria
who
was
a
fine
rider
spent
some
time
one
spring
in
paris
and
rode
every
morning
in
the
bois
she
was
very
handsome
with
a
beautiful
figure
had
handsome
horses
and
attracted
great
attention
prince
hohenlohe
often
rode
with
her
i
was
riding
with
a
friend
one
morning
when
we
saw
handsome
horses
waiting
at
the
just
inside
the
gates
we
divined
they
were
the
empress
horses
and
waited
to
see
her
mount
she
arrived
in
a
coupé
her
maid
with
her
and
mounted
her
horse
from
the
block
the
body
of
her
habit
was
open
when
she
was
settled
in
her
saddle
the
maid
stepped
up
on
the
block
and
buttoned
her
habit
which
i
must
say
fitted
beautifully
as
if
she
were
melted
into
it
the
official
receptions
were
interesting
that
year
as
one
still
saw
a
few
costumes
the
chinese
japanese
persians
greeks
and
roumanians
wore
their
national
dress
and
much
better
they
look
in
them
than
in
the
ordinary
dress
coat
and
white
tie
of
our
men
the
greek
dress
was
very
striking
a
full
white
skirt
with
high
embroidered
belt
but
it
was
only
becoming
when
the
wearer
was
young
with
a
good
figure
i
remember
a
pretty
roumanian
woman
with
a
white
veil
spangled
with
gold
most
effective
now
every
one
wears
the
ordinary
european
dress
except
the
chinese
who
still
keep
their
costume
one
could
hardly
imagine
a
chinese
in
a
frock
coat
and
tall
hat
what
would
he
do
with
his
pigtail
the
entertainments
went
on
pretty
well
that
year
until
august
almost
all
the
embassies
and
ministries
receiving
queen
isabella
of
spain
was
then
living
in
the
big
house
in
the
avenue
kléber
called
the
palais
now
the
hotel
majestic
we
used
to
meet
her
often
driving
in
the
bois
she
was
a
big
stout
rather
woman
did
make
much
effect
in
a
carriage
in
ordinary
street
dress
but
in
her
palace
when
she
received
or
gave
an
audience
she
was
a
very
royal
lady
i
asked
for
an
audience
soon
after
was
named
to
the
foreign
office
we
knew
one
of
her
chamberlains
very
well
duc
de
and
he
arranged
it
for
me
i
arrived
at
the
palace
on
the
appointed
day
a
little
before
four
the
audience
was
for
four
the
big
gates
were
open
a
tall
porter
dressed
in
red
and
gold
lace
and
buttons
and
a
staff
in
his
hand
was
waiting
two
or
three
men
in
black
and
four
or
five
footmen
in
red
liveries
and
powder
at
the
door
and
in
the
hall
i
was
shown
at
once
to
a
small
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
four
or
five
ladies
all
spanish
and
all
fat
were
waiting
in
a
few
minutes
the
duke
appeared
we
talked
a
little
he
looking
at
me
to
see
if
i
had
taken
off
my
veil
and
my
glove
and
then
a
man
in
black
appeared
at
the
door
making
a
low
bow
and
saying
something
in
spanish
the
duke
said
would
i
come
her
majesty
was
ready
to
receive
me
we
passed
through
several
salons
where
there
were
footmen
and
pages
no
ladies
until
we
came
to
a
very
large
one
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
palace
the
big
doors
were
open
and
at
the
far
end
i
saw
the
queen
standing
a
stately
figure
enormous
dressed
in
a
long
black
velvet
dress
a
high
diamond
tiara
on
her
head
from
which
hung
a
black
lace
veil
a
fan
in
her
hand
i
suppose
no
spanish
woman
of
any
station
ever
parts
with
her
fan
and
a
splendid
string
of
pearls
i
made
my
curtsey
on
the
threshold
the
chamberlain
named
me
with
the
usual
formula
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
your
majesty
madame
waddington
the
wife
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
then
backed
himself
out
of
the
room
and
i
proceeded
down
the
long
room
to
the
queen
she
did
move
let
me
make
my
two
curtseys
one
in
the
middle
of
the
room
one
when
i
came
close
up
to
her
and
then
shook
hands
we
remained
standing
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
sat
down
on
a
sofa
not
a
very
small
one
which
she
quite
filled
and
motioned
me
to
take
an
armchair
on
one
side
she
was
very
amiable
had
a
charming
smile
spoke
french
very
well
but
with
a
strong
spanish
accent
she
said
she
was
very
glad
to
see
my
husband
at
the
foreign
office
and
hoped
he
would
stay
long
enough
to
do
some
real
work
said
she
was
very
fond
of
france
loved
driving
in
the
streets
of
paris
there
was
always
so
much
to
see
and
the
people
looked
gay
she
was
very
fond
of
the
theatres
particularly
the
smaller
ones
liked
the
real
parisian
wit
and
gaiety
better
than
the
measured
phrase
and
trained
diction
of
the
français
and
the
odéon
she
spoke
most
warmly
of
marshal
macmahon
hoped
that
he
would
remain
president
of
the
republic
as
long
as
the
republicans
would
let
him
was
afraid
they
would
make
his
position
impossible
but
that
the
younger
generation
always
wanted
reforms
and
changes
i
said
i
thought
that
was
the
way
of
the
world
everywhere
in
families
as
well
as
nations
children
could
not
be
expected
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
their
parents
then
we
talked
about
the
exposition
she
said
the
spanish
show
was
very
good
told
me
to
look
at
the
tapestries
and
embroideries
which
were
quite
wonderful
gold
and
silver
threads
worked
in
with
the
tapestries
the
interview
was
pleasant
and
easy
when
i
took
leave
she
let
me
back
down
the
whole
length
of
the
room
not
half
turning
away
as
so
many
princesses
do
after
the
first
few
steps
so
as
to
curtail
that
very
inconvenient
exit
however
a
day
dress
is
never
so
long
and
cumbersome
as
an
evening
dress
with
a
train
the
chamberlain
was
waiting
just
outside
the
door
also
two
ladies
in
waiting
just
as
fat
as
the
queen
certainly
the
mise
en
scène
was
very
effective
the
number
of
servants
in
red
liveries
the
solitary
standing
figure
at
the
end
of
the
long
enfilade
of
rooms
the
high
diamond
comb
and
long
veil
quite
transformed
the
very
stout
lady
whom
i
used
to
meet
often
walking
in
the
bois
we
dined
once
or
twice
at
the
palace
always
a
very
handsome
dinner
one
for
the
marshal
and
madame
de
macmahon
was
beautifully
done
all
the
footmen
dozens
in
gala
liveries
red
and
yellow
the
maître
in
very
dark
blue
with
gold
epaulettes
and
aiguillettes
the
table
was
covered
with
red
and
yellow
flowers
and
splendid
gold
plate
and
a
very
good
orchestra
of
guitars
and
mandolins
played
all
through
dinner
the
musicians
singing
sometimes
when
they
played
a
popular
song
we
were
all
assembled
in
one
of
the
large
rooms
waiting
for
the
queen
to
appear
as
soon
as
the
marshal
and
madame
de
macmahon
were
announced
she
came
in
meeting
them
at
the
door
making
a
circle
afterward
and
shaking
hands
with
all
the
ladies
lord
lyons
gave
a
beautiful
ball
at
the
embassy
that
season
the
hotel
of
the
british
embassy
is
one
of
the
best
in
paris
fine
opening
on
a
very
large
garden
and
a
large
courtyard
and
side
exit
so
there
was
no
confusion
of
carriages
he
had
need
of
all
his
room
paris
was
crowded
with
english
besides
all
the
exposition
people
there
were
many
tourists
and
english
people
all
expecting
to
be
entertained
at
the
embassy
all
the
world
was
there
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
the
marshal
and
madame
de
macmahon
the
orléans
princes
princesse
mathilde
the
faubourg
germain
the
government
and
as
many
foreigners
as
the
house
could
hold
as
he
invited
a
great
many
people
once
his
obligations
english
and
official
were
satisfied
it
was
only
at
an
embassy
that
such
a
gathering
could
take
place
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
people
of
all
the
different
camps
looking
at
each
other
there
was
a
supper
for
all
the
royalties
before
the
cotillion
i
was
told
that
the
duc
would
take
me
to
supper
i
was
very
pleased
as
we
knew
him
very
well
and
he
was
always
charming
to
us
but
much
surprised
as
the
orléans
princes
never
remained
for
supper
at
any
big
official
function
there
would
have
been
questions
of
place
and
precedence
which
would
have
been
very
difficult
to
settle
when
the
move
was
made
for
supper
things
had
to
be
changed
as
the
orléans
princes
had
gone
home
the
crown
prince
of
denmark
took
me
the
was
prettily
arranged
two
round
tables
lord
lyons
with
the
princesses
of
wales
and
denmark
presiding
at
one
his
niece
the
duchesse
of
norfolk
at
the
other
with
the
princes
of
wales
and
denmark
i
sat
between
the
princes
of
denmark
and
sweden
opposite
me
next
the
prince
of
wales
sat
a
lady
i
did
know
every
one
else
at
the
table
did
she
was
very
with
a
charming
smile
and
most
animated
manner
i
asked
the
prince
of
denmark
in
a
low
voice
who
she
was
thought
it
must
be
one
of
the
foreign
princesses
i
had
yet
met
the
prince
of
wales
heard
my
question
and
immediately
with
his
charming
tact
and
ease
of
manner
said
to
me
you
do
know
the
princesse
mathilde
do
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
you
to
her
naming
me
at
once
in
my
official
capacity
wife
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
the
princess
was
very
gracious
and
smiling
and
we
talked
about
all
sorts
of
things
some
of
her
musical
protégées
who
were
also
mine
she
asked
me
if
i
liked
living
at
the
ministry
quai
she
remembered
it
as
such
a
beautiful
house
when
the
party
broke
up
she
shook
hands
said
she
had
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
waddington
but
would
i
thank
him
from
her
for
what
he
had
done
for
one
of
her
friends
i
tried
to
find
after
supper
to
present
him
to
the
princess
but
he
had
already
gone
did
stay
for
the
cotillion
the
princess
too
went
away
immediately
after
supper
i
met
her
once
or
twice
afterward
she
was
always
friendly
and
we
had
little
talks
together
her
salon
she
received
once
a
week
was
quite
a
centre
all
the
bonapartists
of
course
the
diplomatic
corps
many
strangers
and
all
the
celebrities
in
literature
and
art
with
that
exception
i
never
saw
nor
talked
with
any
member
of
that
family
until
i
had
been
some
years
a
widow
when
the
empress
eugénie
received
me
on
her
yacht
at
cowes
when
the
news
came
of
the
awful
tragedy
of
the
prince
imperial
death
in
zululand
was
foreign
minister
and
he
had
invited
a
large
party
with
music
instantly
put
off
the
party
said
there
was
no
question
of
politics
or
a
bonapartist
prince
it
was
a
frenchman
killed
fighting
bravely
in
a
foreign
country
i
always
thought
the
empress
knew
about
it
and
appreciated
his
act
for
during
his
embassy
in
london
though
we
never
saw
her
she
constantly
sent
him
word
through
mutual
friends
of
little
negotiations
she
knew
about
and
thought
might
interest
him
and
always
spoke
very
well
of
him
as
a
patriotic
statesman
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
her
in
her
prime
when
she
must
have
been
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
graceful
when
i
did
see
her
she
was
no
longer
young
but
a
stately
impressive
figure
and
had
still
the
beautiful
brow
one
sees
in
all
her
pictures
one
of
our
friends
a
very
clever
woman
and
great
told
us
an
amusing
story
of
her
little
son
the
child
was
sometimes
in
the
when
his
mother
was
receiving
and
heard
her
and
all
her
friends
inveighing
against
the
iniquities
of
the
imperial
court
and
the
frivolity
of
the
empress
he
saw
the
empress
walking
one
day
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
she
was
attracted
by
the
group
of
children
stopped
and
talked
to
them
the
boy
was
delighted
and
said
to
his
governess
elle
est
bien
jolie
mais
il
ne
faut
pas
le
dire
à
maman
the
empress
is
very
pretty
but
one
must
not
say
it
to
mother
vii
the
berlin
congress
was
a
most
important
year
for
us
in
many
ways
besides
the
interest
and
fatigues
of
the
exposition
and
the
constant
receiving
and
official
festivities
of
all
kinds
a
great
event
was
looming
before
us
the
berlin
congress
one
had
felt
it
coming
for
some
time
there
were
all
sorts
of
new
delimitations
and
questions
to
be
settled
since
the
war
in
the
balkans
and
europe
was
getting
visibly
nervous
almost
immediately
after
the
opening
of
the
exposition
the
project
took
shape
and
it
was
decided
that
france
should
participate
in
the
congress
and
send
three
representatives
it
was
the
first
time
that
france
had
asserted
herself
since
the
war
in
but
it
was
time
for
her
now
to
emerge
from
her
effacement
and
take
her
place
in
the
congress
of
nations
there
were
many
discussions
both
public
and
private
before
the
plénipotentiaires
were
named
and
a
great
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
many
very
intelligent
and
patriotic
frenchmen
to
see
the
country
launching
itself
upon
dangerous
ground
and
a
possible
conflict
with
bismarck
however
the
thing
was
decided
and
the
three
plenipotentiaries
named
waddington
foreign
minister
first
comte
de
vallier
a
very
clever
and
distinguished
diplomatist
actual
ambassador
at
berlin
second
and
monsieur
desprey
directeur
de
la
politique
au
ministère
des
affaires
etrangères
third
he
was
also
a
very
able
man
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
ministry
au
courant
of
every
treaty
and
negotiation
for
the
last
twenty
years
very
prudent
and
all
colleagues
were
most
cordial
and
charming
on
his
appointment
he
made
a
statement
in
the
house
of
the
line
of
policy
he
intended
to
adopt
and
was
absolutely
approved
and
encouraged
not
a
disparaging
word
of
any
kind
was
said
not
even
the
usual
remark
of
cet
anglais
qui
nous
représente
he
started
the
of
june
in
the
best
conditions
possible
not
an
instruction
of
any
kind
from
his
chief
dufaure
président
du
conseil
very
complimentary
to
him
certainly
but
the
ministers
taking
no
responsibility
themselves
leaving
the
door
open
in
case
he
made
any
mistakes
it
was
evident
that
the
parliament
and
government
were
nervous
it
was
rather
amusing
when
all
the
preparations
for
the
departure
were
going
on
took
a
large
suite
with
him
secretaries
huissiers
and
i
told
them
they
were
as
much
taken
up
with
their
coats
and
embroideries
and
cocked
hats
as
any
pretty
woman
with
her
dresses
i
wanted
very
much
to
go
but
thought
he
would
be
freer
and
have
more
time
to
think
things
over
if
i
were
not
there
he
did
know
berlin
at
all
had
never
seen
bismarck
nor
any
of
the
leading
german
statesmen
and
was
fully
conscious
how
his
every
word
and
act
would
be
criticised
however
if
a
public
man
is
not
criticised
it
usually
means
that
he
is
of
no
consequence
so
attacks
and
criticisms
are
rather
welcome
act
as
a
stimulant
i
could
have
gone
and
stayed
unofficially
with
a
cousin
but
he
thought
that
would
do
vallier
was
a
bachelor
it
would
have
been
rather
an
affair
for
him
to
organise
at
the
embassy
an
apartment
for
a
lady
and
her
maids
though
he
was
most
civil
and
asked
me
to
come
illustration
william
waddington
in
the
uniform
he
wore
as
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
at
the
berlin
congress
i
felt
rather
lonely
in
the
big
ministry
when
they
had
all
gone
and
i
was
left
with
baby
stayed
away
just
five
weeks
and
i
performed
various
official
things
in
his
absence
among
others
the
review
of
the
of
july
the
distinguished
guest
on
that
occasion
was
the
shah
of
persia
who
arrived
with
the
maréchale
in
a
handsome
open
carriage
with
outriders
and
postilions
the
marshal
of
course
was
riding
the
shah
was
not
at
all
a
striking
figure
short
stout
with
a
dark
skin
and
hard
black
eyes
he
had
handsome
jewels
a
large
diamond
fastening
the
white
aigrette
of
his
high
black
cap
and
his
incrusted
with
diamonds
he
gave
a
stiff
little
nod
in
acknowledgment
of
the
bows
and
curtseys
every
one
made
when
he
appeared
in
the
marshal
box
he
immediately
took
his
seat
on
one
side
of
the
maréchale
in
front
of
the
box
one
of
the
ambassadresses
princess
hohenlohe
i
think
next
to
him
the
military
display
seemed
to
interest
him
every
now
and
then
he
made
some
remark
to
the
maréchale
but
he
was
certainly
not
talkative
while
the
interminable
line
of
the
infantry
regiments
was
passing
there
was
a
move
to
the
back
of
the
box
where
there
was
a
table
with
ices
champagne
etc
madame
de
macmahon
came
up
to
me
saying
madame
waddington
sa
majesté
demande
les
nouvelles
de
waddington
upon
which
his
majesty
planted
himself
directly
in
front
of
me
so
close
that
he
almost
touched
me
and
asked
in
a
quick
abrupt
manner
as
if
he
were
firing
off
a
shot
où
est
votre
mari
neither
madame
nor
waddington
nor
any
of
the
terms
that
are
usually
adopted
in
polite
society
a
berlin
sire
pourquoi
à
berlin
comme
plénipotentiaire
français
au
congrès
de
berlin
oui
oui
je
sais
je
sais
cela
beaucoup
il
voit
tant
de
personnes
intéressantes
oui
je
sais
il
va
bien
always
coming
closer
to
me
so
that
i
was
edging
back
against
the
wall
with
his
hard
bright
little
eyes
fixed
on
mine
and
always
the
same
sharp
jerky
tone
il
va
parfaitement
bien
je
vous
remercie
then
there
was
a
pause
and
he
made
one
or
two
other
remarks
which
i
did
quite
understand
i
do
think
his
french
went
very
far
but
i
made
out
something
about
jolies
femmes
and
pointed
out
one
or
two
to
him
but
he
still
remained
staring
into
my
face
and
i
was
delighted
when
his
minister
came
up
to
him
timidly
all
his
people
were
afraid
of
him
and
said
some
personage
wanted
to
be
presented
to
him
he
shook
hands
with
me
said
something
about
votre
mari
revient
bientôt
and
moved
off
the
maréchale
asked
me
if
i
were
not
touched
by
his
majesty
solicitude
for
my
husband
health
and
would
i
like
to
come
to
the
front
of
the
box
and
sit
next
to
him
but
i
told
her
i
could
think
of
engrossing
his
majesty
attention
as
there
were
various
important
people
who
wished
to
be
presented
to
him
i
watched
him
a
little
from
a
distance
trying
to
see
if
anything
made
any
impression
on
him
the
crowd
the
pretty
women
the
march
past
the
long
lines
of
infantry
rather
fatiguing
to
see
as
one
line
regiment
looks
very
like
another
the
chasseurs
with
their
small
chestnut
horses
the
dragoons
more
heavily
mounted
and
the
guns
but
his
face
remained
absolutely
impassive
though
i
think
he
saw
everything
they
told
a
funny
story
of
him
in
london
at
one
of
the
court
balls
when
he
had
looked
on
at
the
dancing
for
some
time
he
said
to
the
prince
of
wales
tell
those
people
to
stop
now
i
have
seen
enough
evidently
thought
it
was
a
ballet
performing
for
his
amusement
another
one
at
one
of
the
european
courts
was
funny
the
monarch
was
very
old
his
consort
also
when
the
shah
was
presented
to
the
royal
lady
he
looked
hard
at
her
without
saying
a
word
then
remarked
to
her
husband
laide
vieille
pourquoi
garder
ugly
old
why
keep
her
illustration
shah
of
persia
i
went
to
a
big
dinner
and
reception
at
the
british
embassy
given
for
all
the
directors
and
commissioners
of
the
exposition
it
was
a
lovely
warm
night
the
garden
was
lighted
everybody
walking
about
and
an
orchestra
playing
many
of
the
officials
had
their
wives
and
daughters
with
them
and
some
of
the
toilettes
were
wonderful
there
were
a
good
many
pretty
women
swedes
and
danes
the
northern
type
very
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
attracting
much
attention
and
a
group
of
chinese
all
in
costume
standing
proudly
aloof
not
the
least
interested
apparently
in
the
gay
scene
before
them
i
wonder
what
they
thought
of
european
manners
and
customs
there
was
no
dancing
which
i
suppose
would
have
shocked
their
eastern
morals
lord
lyons
asked
me
why
i
was
in
berlin
i
said
for
the
best
of
reasons
my
husband
preferred
going
without
me
but
i
hoped
he
would
send
for
me
perhaps
at
the
end
of
the
congress
he
told
me
lady
salisbury
was
there
with
her
husband
he
seemed
rather
sceptical
as
to
the
peaceful
issue
of
the
negotiations
thought
so
many
unforeseen
questions
would
come
up
and
complicate
matters
i
went
to
a
ball
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
also
given
for
all
the
foreigners
and
french
people
connected
with
the
exposition
the
getting
there
was
very
long
and
tiring
the
did
no
good
as
every
one
had
one
comte
de
pontécoulant
went
with
me
and
he
protested
vigorously
but
one
of
the
head
men
of
the
police
whom
he
knew
well
came
up
to
the
carriage
to
explain
that
nothing
could
be
done
there
was
a
long
line
of
diplomatic
and
official
carriages
and
we
must
take
our
chance
with
the
rest
some
of
our
cousins
americans
never
got
there
at
all
sat
for
hours
in
their
carriage
in
the
rue
du
rivoli
moving
an
inch
at
a
time
happily
it
was
a
lovely
warm
night
and
as
we
got
near
we
saw
lots
of
people
walking
who
had
left
their
carriages
some
little
distance
off
hopelessly
wedged
in
a
crowd
of
vehicles
the
women
in
light
dresses
with
flowers
and
jewels
in
their
hair
the
rooms
looked
very
handsome
when
at
last
we
did
get
in
particularly
the
staircase
with
a
garde
municipal
on
every
step
and
banks
of
palms
and
flowers
on
the
landing
in
the
hall
wherever
flowers
could
be
put
the
ville
de
paris
furnishes
all
the
flowers
and
plants
for
the
official
receptions
and
they
always
are
very
well
arranged
some
trophies
of
flags
too
of
all
nations
made
a
great
effect
i
did
see
many
people
i
knew
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
the
crowd
but
some
one
got
me
a
chair
at
the
open
window
giving
on
the
balcony
and
i
was
quite
happy
sitting
there
looking
at
the
people
pass
the
whole
world
was
represented
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
different
types
southerners
small
slight
dark
impatient
wriggling
through
the
crowd
the
big
broad
calm
squaring
their
shoulders
when
there
came
a
sudden
rush
and
waiting
quite
patiently
a
chance
to
get
a
little
ahead
some
of
the
women
too
pushed
well
evidently
determined
to
see
all
they
could
i
do
think
any
royalties
even
minor
ones
were
there
wrote
pretty
regularly
from
berlin
particularly
the
first
days
before
the
real
work
of
the
congress
began
he
started
rather
sooner
than
he
had
at
first
intended
so
as
to
have
a
little
time
to
talk
matters
over
with
vallier
and
make
acquaintance
with
some
of
his
colleagues
vallier
with
all
the
staff
of
the
embassy
met
him
at
the
station
when
he
arrived
in
berlin
also
holstein
our
old
friend
who
was
at
the
german
embassy
in
paris
with
arnim
to
compliment
him
from
prince
bismarck
and
he
had
hardly
been
fifteen
minutes
at
the
embassy
when
count
herbert
von
bismarck
arrived
with
greetings
and
compliments
from
his
father
he
went
to
see
bismarck
the
next
day
found
him
at
home
and
very
civil
he
was
quite
friendly
very
courteous
and
bonhomme
original
and
even
amusing
in
his
conversation
but
with
a
hard
look
about
the
eyes
which
bodes
no
good
to
those
who
cross
his
path
he
had
just
time
to
get
back
to
the
embassy
and
get
into
his
uniform
for
his
audience
with
the
crown
prince
late
emperor
frederick
the
vice
des
ceremonies
came
for
him
in
a
court
carriage
and
they
drove
off
to
the
palace
sitting
alone
on
the
back
seat
the
facing
him
on
the
front
i
was
ushered
into
a
room
where
the
prince
was
standing
he
was
very
friendly
and
talked
for
twenty
minutes
about
all
sorts
of
things
in
excellent
french
with
a
few
words
of
english
now
and
then
to
show
he
knew
of
my
english
connection
he
spoke
of
my
travels
in
the
east
of
the
de
bunsens
of
the
emperor
health
the
old
man
is
much
better
and
decidedly
recovering
and
of
his
great
wish
for
peace
all
the
plenipotentiaries
had
not
yet
arrived
they
appeared
only
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
day
before
the
congress
opened
prince
bismarck
sent
out
the
invitation
for
the
first
sitting
footnote
the
crown
prince
represented
his
father
at
all
the
functions
some
days
before
the
meeting
of
the
congress
the
old
emperor
had
been
wounded
in
the
arm
by
a
nihilist
nobiling
who
fired
from
a
window
when
the
emperor
was
passing
in
an
open
carriage
the
wound
was
slight
but
the
old
man
was
much
shaken
and
unable
to
take
any
part
in
the
ceremonies
or
receive
any
of
the
plenipotentiaries

la
première
réunion
du
congrès
aura
lieu
le
juin
à
deux
heures
au
palais
du
chancelier
de
wilhelmstrasse
berlin
le
juin
it
was
a
brilliant
assemblage
of
great
names
and
intelligences
that
responded
to
his
invitation
gortschakoff
schouvaloff
andrassy
beaconsfield
salisbury
karolyi
hohenlohe
corti
and
many
others
younger
men
who
acted
as
secretaries
french
was
the
language
spoken
the
only
exception
being
made
by
lord
beaconsfield
who
always
spoke
in
english
although
it
was
most
evident
said
that
he
understood
french
perfectly
well
the
first
day
was
merely
an
official
opening
of
the
congress
every
one
in
uniform
but
only
for
that
occasion
after
that
they
all
went
in
ordinary
morning
dress
putting
on
their
uniforms
again
on
the
last
day
only
when
they
signed
the
treaty
writes
bismarck
presides
and
did
his
part
well
he
speaks
french
fairly
but
very
slowly
finding
his
words
with
difficulty
but
he
knows
what
he
means
to
say
and
lets
every
one
see
that
he
does
no
one
else
said
much
that
first
day
each
man
was
rather
reserved
waiting
for
his
neighbour
to
begin
beaconsfield
made
a
short
speech
which
was
trying
for
some
of
his
colleagues
particularly
the
turks
who
had
evidently
much
difficulty
in
understanding
english
they
were
counting
upon
sympathy
but
a
little
nervous
as
to
a
supposed
agreement
between
england
and
russia
the
russians
listened
most
attentively
there
seemed
to
be
a
distrust
of
england
on
their
part
and
a
decided
rivalry
between
gortschakoff
and
beaconsfield
the
congress
dined
that
first
night
with
the
crown
prince
at
the
schloss
in
the
famous
white
hall
all
in
uniform
and
orders
said
the
heat
was
awful
but
the
evening
interesting
there
were
one
hundred
and
forty
guests
no
ladies
except
the
royal
princesses
not
even
the
ambassadresses
sat
on
bismarck
left
who
talked
a
great
deal
intending
to
make
himself
agreeable
he
had
a
long
talk
after
dinner
with
the
crown
princess
princess
royal
of
england
who
spoke
english
with
him
he
found
her
charming
intelligent
and
cultivated
and
so
easy
not
at
all
stiff
and
shy
like
so
many
royalties
he
saw
her
very
often
during
his
stay
in
berlin
and
she
was
unfailingly
kind
to
him
and
to
me
also
when
i
knew
her
later
in
rome
and
london
she
always
lives
in
my
memory
as
one
of
the
most
charming
women
i
have
ever
met
her
face
often
comes
back
to
me
with
her
beautiful
bright
smile
and
the
saddest
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
i
have
known
very
few
like
her
also
had
a
talk
with
prince
father
of
the
duchess
of
connaught
whom
he
found
rather
a
soldier
with
a
short
abrupt
manner
he
left
bitter
memories
in
france
during
the
war
was
called
the
red
prince
he
was
so
hard
and
cruel
always
ready
to
shoot
somebody
and
burn
down
villages
on
the
slightest
provocation
so
different
from
the
prince
imperial
the
unser
fritz
of
the
germans
who
always
had
a
kind
word
for
the
fallen
foe
illustration
prince
bismarck
from
a
sketch
by
anton
von
werner
days
were
very
full
and
when
the
important
sittings
began
it
was
sometimes
hard
work
the
congress
room
was
very
hot
all
the
colleagues
seemed
to
have
a
holy
horror
of
open
windows
and
some
of
the
men
very
long
and
tedious
in
stating
their
cases
of
course
they
were
at
a
disadvantage
not
speaking
their
own
language
very
few
of
them
knew
french
well
except
the
russians
and
they
had
to
go
very
carefully
and
be
quite
sure
of
the
exact
significance
of
the
words
they
used
got
a
ride
every
morning
as
the
congress
only
met
in
the
afternoon
they
rode
usually
in
the
thiergarten
which
is
not
very
large
but
the
were
good
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
out
of
berlin
into
the
open
country
without
going
through
a
long
stretch
of
suburbs
and
sandy
roads
which
were
not
very
tempting
a
great
many
officers
rode
in
the
park
and
one
morning
when
he
was
riding
with
the
military
attache
of
the
embassy
two
officers
rode
up
and
claimed
acquaintance
having
known
him
in
france
in
the
year
of
the
war
they
rode
a
short
time
together
and
the
next
day
he
received
an
invitation
from
the
officers
of
a
smart
uhlan
regiment
to
dine
at
their
mess
in
remembrance
of
the
kind
hospitality
shown
to
some
of
their
officers
who
had
been
quartered
at
his
place
in
france
during
the
war
as
the
hospitality
was
decidedly
forced
and
the
presence
of
the
german
officers
not
very
agreeable
to
the
family
the
invitation
was
not
very
happy
it
was
well
meant
but
was
one
of
those
curious
instances
of
german
want
of
tact
which
one
notices
so
much
if
one
lives
much
with
germans
the
hours
of
the
various
entertainments
were
funny
at
a
big
dinner
at
prince
bismarck
the
guests
were
invited
at
six
and
at
every
one
had
gone
sat
next
to
countess
marie
the
daughter
of
the
house
found
her
simple
and
inclined
to
talk
speaking
both
french
and
english
well
immediately
after
dinner
the
men
all
smoked
everywhere
in
the
on
the
terrace
some
taking
a
turn
in
the
park
with
bismarck
found
princess
bismarck
not
very
femme
du
monde
she
was
preoccupied
first
with
her
dinner
then
with
her
husband
for
fear
he
should
eat
too
much
or
take
cold
going
out
of
the
warm
into
the
evening
air
there
were
no
ladies
at
the
dinner
except
the
family
the
german
lady
does
seem
to
occupy
the
same
place
in
society
as
the
french
and
english
woman
does
in
paris
the
wives
of
ambassadors
and
ministers
are
always
invited
to
all
official
banquets
amusements
of
all
kinds
were
provided
for
the
plenipotentiaries
early
in
july
writes
of
a
the
whole
congress
wives
too
this
time
invited
to
potsdam
for
the
day
he
was
rather
dreading
a
long
day
excursions
were
not
much
in
his
line
however
this
one
seems
to
have
been
successful
he
writes
our
excursion
went
off
better
than
could
be
expected
the
party
consisted
of
the
plenipotentiaries
and
a
certain
number
of
court
officers
and
generals
we
started
by
rail
stopped
at
a
station
called
wannsee
and
embarked
on
board
a
small
steamer
the
princess
royal
receiving
the
guests
as
they
arrived
on
board
we
then
started
for
a
trip
on
the
lakes
but
before
long
there
came
a
violent
squall
which
obliged
the
sailors
to
take
down
the
awnings
in
time
and
drove
every
one
down
into
the
cabins
it
lasted
about
half
an
hour
after
which
it
cleared
up
and
every
one
reappeared
on
deck
in
course
of
time
we
landed
near
babelsberg
where
carriages
were
waiting
i
was
told
off
to
go
in
the
first
with
the
princess
royal
countess
karolyi
wife
of
the
austrian
ambassador
a
beautiful
young
woman
and
andrassy
we
went
over
the
château
of
babelsberg
which
is
a
pretty
gothic
not
a
palace
and
belongs
to
the
present
emperor
after
that
we
had
a
longish
drive
through
different
parks
and
villages
and
finally
arrived
at
sans
souci
where
we
dined
after
dinner
we
strolled
through
the
rooms
and
were
shown
the
different
souvenirs
of
frederick
the
great
and
got
home
at
saw
a
good
deal
of
his
cousin
george
de
bunsen
a
charming
man
very
cultivated
and
cosmopolitan
he
had
a
pretty
house
in
the
new
quarter
of
berlin
and
was
most
hospitable
he
had
an
interesting
dinner
there
with
some
of
the
literary
men
and
savants
mommsen
leppius
helmholtz
curtius
most
of
them
his
colleagues
as
he
was
a
member
of
the
berlin
academy
he
found
those
evenings
a
delightful
change
after
the
long
hot
afternoons
in
the
wilhelmsstrasse
where
necessarily
there
was
so
much
that
was
long
and
tedious
i
think
even
he
got
tired
of
greek
frontiers
notwithstanding
his
sympathy
for
the
country
he
did
what
he
could
for
the
greeks
who
were
very
grateful
to
him
and
gave
him
in
memory
of
the
efforts
he
made
on
their
behalf
a
fine
group
in
bronze
of
a
female
figure
greece
throwing
off
the
bonds
of
turkey
some
of
the
speakers
were
very
interesting
he
found
schouvaloff
always
a
brilliant
debater
he
spoke
french
perfectly
was
always
and
courteous
and
defended
his
cause
well
one
felt
there
was
a
latent
animosity
between
the
english
and
the
russians
lord
beaconsfield
made
one
or
two
strong
speeches
very
much
to
the
point
and
slightly
arrogant
but
as
they
were
always
made
in
english
they
were
not
understood
by
all
the
assembly
was
always
pleased
to
meet
prince
hohenlohe
actual
german
ambassador
to
paris
who
had
been
named
the
third
german
plenipotentiary
he
was
perfectly
au
courant
of
all
that
went
on
at
court
and
in
the
official
world
knew
everybody
and
introduced
to
various
ladies
who
received
informally
where
he
could
spend
an
hour
or
two
quietly
without
meeting
all
his
colleagues
blowitz
of
course
appeared
on
the
scene
the
most
important
person
in
berlin
in
his
own
opinion
i
am
not
quite
convinced
that
he
saw
all
the
people
he
said
he
did
or
whether
all
the
extraordinary
confidences
were
made
to
him
which
he
related
to
the
public
but
he
certainly
impressed
people
very
much
and
i
suppose
his
letters
as
newspaper
correspondent
were
quite
wonderful
he
was
remarkably
intelligent
and
absolutely
unscrupulous
did
hesitate
to
put
into
the
mouths
of
people
what
he
wished
them
to
say
so
he
naturally
had
a
great
pull
over
the
ordinary
journalist
who
wrote
simply
what
he
saw
and
heard
as
he
was
the
paris
correspondent
of
london
he
was
often
at
the
french
embassy
never
trusted
him
very
much
and
his
flair
was
right
as
he
was
anything
but
true
to
him
the
last
days
of
the
congress
were
very
busy
ones
the
negotiations
were
kept
secret
enough
but
things
always
leak
out
and
the
papers
had
to
say
something
i
was
rather
émue
at
the
tone
of
the
french
press
but
wrote
me
not
to
mind
they
did
really
know
anything
and
when
the
treaty
was
signed
france
would
certainly
come
out
very
honourably
all
this
has
long
passed
into
the
domain
of
history
and
has
been
told
so
many
times
by
so
many
different
people
that
i
will
not
go
into
details
except
to
say
that
the
french
protectorate
of
tunis
now
one
of
our
most
flourishing
colonies
was
entirely
arranged
by
in
a
long
confidential
conversation
with
lord
salisbury
the
cession
of
the
island
of
cyprus
by
turkey
to
the
english
was
a
most
unexpected
and
disagreeable
surprise
to
however
he
went
instantly
to
lord
salisbury
who
was
a
little
embarrassed
as
that
negotiation
had
been
kept
secret
which
did
seem
quite
fair
everything
else
having
been
openly
discussed
around
the
council
table
he
quite
understood
feelings
in
the
matter
and
was
perfectly
willing
to
make
an
arrangement
about
tunis
the
thing
was
neither
understood
nor
approved
at
first
by
the
french
government
returned

la

as
one
of
his
friends
defined
the
situation
some
years
ago
he
was
almost
disavowed
by
his
government
the
ministers
were
timid
and
unwilling
that
france
should
take
any
initiative
even
his
friend
léon
say
then
minister
of
finances
a
very
clever
man
and
brilliant
politician
said
notre
collègue
waddington
contre
son
habitude
emballé
cette
fois
pour
la
question
de
la
tunisie
our
colleague
waddington
contrary
to
his
nature
has
quite
lost
his
head
this
time
over
the
tunis
question
i
think
the
course
of
events
has
fully
justified
his
action
and
now
that
it
has
proved
such
a
success
every
one
claims
to
have
taken
the
initiative
of
the
french
protectorate
of
tunis
all
honours
have
been
paid
to
those
who
carried
out
the
project
and
very
little
is
said
of
the
man
who
originated
the
scheme
in
spite
of
great
difficulties
at
home
and
abroad
some
of
friends
know
the
truth
illustration
the
berlin
congress
from
a
painting
by
anton
von
werner
there
was
a
great
exchange
of
visits
photographs
and
autographs
the
last
days
of
the
congress
among
other
things
which
brought
back
from
berlin
and
which
will
be
treasured
by
his
grandsons
as
a
historical
souvenir
was
a
fan
quite
a
plain
wooden
fan
with
the
signatures
of
all
the
plenipotentiaries
some
of
them
very
characteristic
the
french
signatures
are
curiously
small
and
distinct
a
contrast
to
smudge
was
quite
sorry
to
say
to
some
of
his
colleagues
andrassy
with
his
quick
sympathies
and
instant
comprehension
of
all
sides
of
a
question
attracted
him
very
much
he
was
a
striking
personality
quite
the
slav
type
had
little
private
intercourse
with
prince
gortschakoff
who
was
already
an
old
man
and
the
type
of
the
diplomatist
making
very
long
and
phrases
which
made
people
rather
impatient
on
the
whole
was
satisfied
he
writes
two
or
three
days
before
the
signing
of
the
treaty
as
far
as
i
can
see
at
present
no
one
will
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
congress
it
is
perhaps
the
best
proof
that
it
is
dealing
fairly
and
equitably
with
the
very
exaggerated
claims
and
pretensions
of
all
parties
anyhow
france
will
come
out
of
the
whole
affair
honourably
and
having
done
all
that
a
strictly
neutral
power
can
do
the
treaty
was
signed
on
july
by
all
the
plenipotentiaries
in
full
uniform
said
there
was
a
decided
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
relief
that
it
was
finished
even
bismarck
looked
less
preoccupied
as
if
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
his
shoulders
of
course
he
was
supposed
to
have
had
his
own
way
in
everything
everybody
not
only
the
french
was
afraid
of
him
with
his
iron
will
and
unscrupulous
brushing
aside
or
even
annihilating
everything
that
came
in
his
way
he
was
a
formidable
adversary
there
was
a
gala
dinner
at
the
schloss
to
celebrate
the
signing
of
the
treaty
it
was
the
exact
repetition
of
the
first
at
the
opening
of
the
congress
i
sat
on
the
left
of
bismarck
and
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
with
him
the
crown
prince
and
princess
were
just
opposite
and
the
princess
talked
a
great
deal
with
me
across
the
table
always
in
english
the
crown
princess
could
never
forget
that
she
was
born
princess
royal
of
england
her
household
was
managed
on
english
principles
her
children
brought
up
by
english
nurses
she
herself
always
spoke
english
with
them
of
course
there
must
have
been
many
things
in
germany
which
were
distasteful
to
her
so
many
of
the
small
refinements
of
life
which
are
absolute
necessaries
in
england
were
almost
unknown
luxuries
in
germany
particularly
when
she
married
now
there
has
been
a
great
advance
in
comfort
and
even
elegance
in
german
houses
and
habits
her
english
proclivities
made
her
a
great
many
enemies
and
i
do
believe
the
iron
chancellor
made
things
easy
for
her
the
dinner
at
the
schloss
was
as
usual
at
six
and
at
nine
had
to
go
to
take
leave
of
the
empress
who
was
very
french
in
her
sympathies
and
had
always
been
very
kind
to
him
her
daughter
the
grand
duchess
of
baden
was
there
and
had
a
very
pleasant
hour
with
the
two
ladies
the
empress
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
about
the
congress
and
particularly
about
bismarck
if
he
was
in
a
fairly
good
temper
when
he
had
his
nerves
he
was
simply
impossible
did
care
what
people
thought
of
him
and
did
hesitate
to
show
when
he
was
bored
the
grand
duchess
added
smilingly
he
is
perfectly
intolerant
has
no
patience
with
a
fool
i
suppose
most
people
are
of
this
opinion
i
am
not
personally
i
have
some
nice
foolish
kindly
happy
friends
of
both
sexes
i
am
always
glad
to
see
i
think
they
are
rather
resting
in
these
days
of
high
education
and
culture
and
pose
finished
his
evening
at
lady
salisbury
who
had
a
farewell
reception
for
all
the
plenipotentiaries
he
took
leave
of
his
colleagues
all
of
whom
had
been
most
friendly
the
only
one
who
was
a
little
stiff
with
him
and
expressed
no
desire
to
meet
him
again
was
corti
the
italian
plenipotentiary
he
suspected
of
course
that
something
had
been
arranged
about
tunis
and
was
much
annoyed
that
he
had
been
able
to
get
tripoli
for
italy
he
was
our
colleague
afterward
in
london
and
there
was
always
a
little
constraint
and
coolness
in
his
manner
left
berlin
on
the
having
been
five
weeks
away
viii
gaieties
at
the
quai
got
home
on
the
and
was
so
busy
the
first
days
with
his
colleagues
and
political
friends
that
i
did
see
much
more
of
him
than
if
he
had
been
in
berlin
he
was
rather
disgusted
and
discouraged
at
the
view
his
colleagues
of
the
cabinet
and
his
friends
took
of
attitude
at
the
congress
the
only
man
who
seemed
to
be
able
to
look
ahead
a
little
and
understand
what
a
future
there
might
be
for
france
in
tunis
was
gambetta
i
remember
quite
well
his
telling
of
an
interesting
conversation
with
him
gambetta
was
very
keen
about
foreign
affairs
very
patriotic
and
not
at
all
willing
that
france
should
remain
indefinitely
a
weakened
power
still
suffering
from
the
defeat
of
there
were
many
fêtes
and
reunions
of
all
kinds
all
through
the
summer
months
as
people
had
flocked
to
paris
for
the
exposition
we
remained
in
town
until
the
first
days
of
august
then
went
to
his
in
the
department
of
the
aisne
and
i
went
down
to
deauville
he
joined
me
there
and
we
had
a
pleasant
month
bathing
driving
and
seeing
a
great
many
people
we
had
taken
sir
joseph
oliffe
villa
one
of
the
best
in
deauville
oliffe
an
englishman
was
one
of
emperor
napoleon
physicians
and
he
and
the
duc
de
morny
were
the
founders
of
deauville
which
was
very
fashionable
as
long
as
morny
lived
and
the
empire
lasted
but
it
lost
its
vogue
for
some
years
after
the
war
fashion
and
society
generally
congregating
at
trouville
there
were
not
many
villas
then
and
one
rather
bad
hotel
but
the
sea
was
nearer
than
it
is
now
and
people
all
went
to
the
beach
in
the
morning
and
fished
for
shrimps
in
the
afternoon
and
led
a
quiet
life
there
was
no
polo
nor
golf
nor
automobiles
not
many
carriages
a
good
where
played
regularly
and
races
every
sunday
in
august
which
brought
naturally
a
gay
young
crowd
of
all
the
sporting
world
the
train
des
maris
that
left
paris
every
saturday
evening
brought
a
great
many
men
it
was
quite
different
from
the
deauville
of
which
is
charming
with
quantities
of
pretty
villas
and
gardens
and
sports
of
all
kinds
but
the
sea
is
so
far
off
one
has
to
take
quite
a
long
walk
to
get
to
it
and
the
mornings
on
the
beach
and
the
expeditions
to
trouville
in
the
afternoon
across
the
ferry
to
do
a
little
shopping
in
the
rue
de
paris
are
things
of
the
past
curiously
enough
while
i
was
looking
over
my
notes
the
other
day
i
had
a
visit
from
an
old
friend
the
duc
de
who
was
one
of
the
inner
circle
of
the
imperial
household
of
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
and
took
an
active
part
in
all
that
went
on
at
court
he
had
just
been
hearing
from
a
friend
of
the
very
brilliant
season
at
deauville
this
year
and
the
streams
of
gold
that
flowed
into
the
caisse
of
the
management
of
the
new
hotel
and
casino
every
possible
luxury
and
every
inducement
to
spend
money
racing
gambling
pretty
women
of
all
nationalities
and
facile
character
beautifully
dressed
and
covered
with
jewels
side
by
side
with
the
bearers
of
some
of
the
proudest
names
in
france
he
said
that
just
fifty
years
ago
he
went
to
deauville
with
the
duc
de
morny
princesse
metternich
and
the
comtesse
de
pourtéles
to
inaugurate
the
new
then
of
the
simplest
description
the
ladies
were
badly
lodged
in
a
hotel
and
he
had
a
room
in
a
fisherman
hut
marshal
macmahon
had
a
house
near
trouville
that
year
and
he
came
over
occasionally
to
see
always
on
horseback
and
early
in
the
morning
used
to
struggle
into
his
clothes
when
le
marechal
was
announced
i
think
the
marshal
preferred
his
military
title
very
much
to
his
civic
honours
i
suppose
there
never
was
so
unwilling
a
president
of
a
republic
except
many
years
later
casimir
périer
who
certainly
hated
the
prison
of
the
elysée
but
the
marshal
was
a
soldier
and
his
military
discipline
helped
him
through
many
difficult
positions
we
had
various
visitors
who
came
down
for
hours
one
charming
visit
from
the
marquis
de
vogüé
then
french
ambassador
at
vienna
where
he
was
very
much
liked
a
persona
grata
in
every
way
he
was
very
tall
quite
the
type
of
the
ambassador
when
i
went
to
inspect
his
room
i
was
rather
struck
by
the
shortness
of
the
bed
think
his
long
legs
could
ever
get
into
it
the
valet
assured
me
it
was
all
right
the
bed
was
normal
but
i
doubt
if
he
had
a
very
comfortable
night
he
and
were
old
friends
had
travelled
in
the
east
together
and
discussed
every
possible
subject
during
long
starlight
nights
in
the
desert
they
certainly
never
thought
then
that
one
day
they
would
be
closely
associated
as
ambassador
and
foreign
minister
vogüé
did
like
the
republic
did
believe
in
the
capacity
or
the
sincerity
of
the
republicans
could
understand
how
could
he
was
a
personal
friend
of
the
marshal
remained
at
vienna
during
the
marshal
presidency
but
left
with
him
much
to
regret
who
knew
what
good
service
he
had
done
at
vienna
and
what
a
difficult
post
that
would
be
for
an
improvised
diplomatist
it
was
then
and
i
fancy
is
still
one
of
the
stiffest
courts
in
europe
one
hears
amusing
stories
from
some
diplomatists
of
the
rigid
etiquette
in
court
circles
which
the
americans
were
always
infringing
a
great
friend
of
mine
an
american
who
had
lived
all
her
life
abroad
and
whose
husband
was
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
corps
in
vienna
was
always
worrying
over
the
misdemeanours
of
the
americans
who
never
paid
any
attention
to
rules
or
court
etiquette
they
invaded
charmed
circles
walked
boldly
up
to
archdukes
and
duchesses
talking
to
them
cheerfully
and
easily
without
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
giving
them
a
great
deal
of
information
upon
all
subjects
austrian
as
well
as
american
and
probably
interested
the
very
stiff
austrian
royalties
much
more
than
the
ordinary
trained
diplomatist
who
would
naturally
be
more
correct
in
his
attitude
and
conversation
i
think
the
american
nationality
is
the
most
convenient
in
the
world
the
americans
do
just
as
they
like
and
no
one
is
ever
surprised
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
they
are
americans
i
have
often
noticed
little
faults
of
manners
or
breeding
which
would
shock
one
in
a
representative
of
an
older
civilisation
pass
quite
unnoticed
or
merely
provoke
a
smile
of
amusement
we
drove
about
a
great
deal
the
country
at
the
back
of
deauville
going
away
from
the
sea
is
lovely
very
like
england
charming
narrow
roads
with
high
banks
and
hedges
on
each
side
big
trees
with
spreading
branches
meeting
overhead
stretches
of
green
fields
with
cows
grazing
placidly
and
horses
and
colts
gambolling
about
it
is
a
great
grazing
and
breeding
country
there
are
many
haras
breeding
stables
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
big
norman
posters
are
much
in
demand
i
have
friends
who
never
take
their
horses
to
the
country
they
hire
for
the
season
a
pair
of
strong
norman
horses
that
go
all
day
up
and
down
hill
at
the
same
regular
pace
and
who
get
over
a
vast
amount
of
country
we
stopped
once
or
twice
when
we
were
a
large
party
two
or
three
carriages
and
had
tea
at
one
of
the
numerous
farmhouses
that
were
scattered
about
boiling
water
was
a
difficulty
milk
cider
good
bread
and
butter
cheese
we
could
always
find
sometimes
a
galette
but
a
kettle
and
boiling
water
were
entirely
out
of
their
habits
they
used
to
boil
the
water
in
a
large
black
pot
and
take
it
out
with
a
big
spoon
however
it
amused
us
and
the
water
really
did
boil
we
had
an
italian
friend
count
who
went
with
us
sometimes
and
he
was
very
débrouillard
made
himself
delightful
at
once
to
the
fermière
and
got
whatever
he
wanted
chairs
and
tables
set
out
on
the
grass
with
all
the
cows
and
colts
and
chickens
walking
about
quite
undisturbed
by
the
unusual
sights
and
sounds
it
was
all
very
rustic
and
a
delightful
change
from
the
glories
of
the
exposition
and
official
life
it
amused
me
perfectly
to
see
with
a
straw
hat
sitting
on
a
rather
rickety
stool
eating
bread
and
butter
and
jam
once
or
twice
some
of
secretaries
came
down
with
despatches
and
he
had
a
good
morning
work
but
on
the
whole
the
month
passed
lazily
and
pleasantly
we
went
back
to
paris
about
the
of
september
and
remained
there
until
the
end
of
the
exposition
paris
was
again
crowded
with
foreigners
the
month
of
october
was
beautiful
bright
and
warm
and
the
afternoons
at
the
exposition
were
delightful
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
the
crowd
had
dispersed
a
little
and
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
lingered
on
the
meudon
hills
and
the
river
the
buildings
and
costumes
lost
their
tawdry
look
and
one
saw
only
a
mass
of
moving
colour
which
seemed
to
soften
and
lose
itself
in
the
evening
shadows
there
were
various
closing
entertainments
the
marshal
gave
a
splendid
fête
at
versailles
we
drove
out
and
had
some
difficulty
in
making
our
way
through
the
crowd
of
carriages
soldiers
police
and
spectators
that
lined
the
road
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
as
we
got
near
the
palace
which
was
a
blaze
of
light
the
terraces
and
gardens
were
also
illuminated
and
the
effect
of
the
little
lamps
hidden
away
in
the
branches
of
the
old
trees
cut
into
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
was
quite
wonderful
there
were
not
as
many
people
at
the
entrance
of
the
palace
as
we
had
expected
to
find
for
the
invitations
had
been
most
generously
given
to
all
nationalities
at
first
the
rooms
which
were
brilliantly
lighted
looked
almost
empty
the
famous
galerie
des
glaces
was
quite
enchanting
almost
too
light
if
there
can
be
too
much
light
at
a
fête
there
were
very
few
people
in
it
when
we
arrived
rather
early
so
much
so
that
when
i
said
to
de
one
of
the
how
perfectly
beautiful
it
is
even
now
empty
what
will
it
be
when
all
the
uniforms
and
jewels
are
reflected
in
the
mirrors
his
answer
was
ah
madame
i
am
afraid
we
sha
have
people
enough
the
hall
is
so
enormous
i
thought
of
him
afterward
when
an
angry
crowd
was
battering
at
the
doors
of
one
of
the
salons
where
the
royalties
were
having
refreshments
i
do
think
they
realised
and
we
certainly
did
what
the
noise
meant
but
some
of
the
marshal
household
who
knew
that
only
a
slight
temporary
partition
was
between
us
and
an
irate
mob
struggling
up
the
staircase
were
green
with
anxiety
however
the
royalties
all
got
away
without
any
difficulty
and
we
tried
to
hurry
immediately
after
them
but
a
dense
crowd
was
then
pouring
into
the
room
at
each
end
and
for
a
moment
things
looked
ugly
the
gentlemen
my
husband
and
my
eugene
schuyler
lord
lyons
british
ambassador
a
big
man
and
one
or
two
others
put
us
my
sister
schuyler
and
me
in
a
recess
of
one
of
the
big
windows
with
heavy
furniture
in
front
of
us
but
that
was
not
very
pleasant
with
the
crowd
moving
both
ways
closing
in
upon
us
and
the
men
were
getting
nervous
so
one
of
our
secretaries
squeezed
through
the
crowd
and
found
two
or
three
huissiers
came
back
with
them
and
we
made
a
procession
two
big
huissiers
in
front
with
their
silver
chains
and
swords
the
mark
of
official
status
which
always
impresses
a
french
crowd
then
lord
lyons
my
sister
and
i
then
and
schuyler
and
two
more
men
behind
us
and
with
considerable
difficulty
and
a
good
many
angry
expostulations
we
made
our
way
out
happily
our
carriages
and
servants
with
our
wraps
were
waiting
in
one
of
the
inner
courts
and
we
got
away
easily
enough
but
the
evening
was
disastrous
to
most
of
the
company
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
between
the
household
and
the
officials
at
versailles
as
but
one
staircase
and
there
are
several
was
opened
to
the
public
which
was
of
course
absolutely
insufficient
why
others
were
not
opened
and
lighted
will
always
be
a
mystery
every
one
got
jammed
in
the
one
narrow
stairway
people
jostled
and
tumbled
over
each
other
some
of
the
women
fainted
and
were
carried
out
borne
high
aloft
over
the
heads
of
the
struggling
multitudes
and
many
people
never
saw
their
cloaks
again
the
vestiaire
was
taken
by
storm
satin
and
lace
cloaks
lying
on
the
ground
trampled
upon
by
everybody
and
at
the
end
various
men
not
having
been
able
to
find
their
coats
were
disporting
themselves
in
pink
satin
cloaks
lined
with
over
their
shoulders
quantities
of
people
never
got
into
the
palace
not
even
on
the
staircase
the
landing
was
directly
opposite
the
room
where
the
princes
had
their
buffet
and
if
they
had
succeeded
in
forcing
the
door
it
would
have
been
a
catastrophe
while
we
were
standing
in
the
window
looking
into
the
park
which
looked
an
enchanted
garden
with
the
lights
and
flowers
we
wondered
if
we
could
jump
or
climb
down
if
the
crowd
pressed
too
much
upon
us
but
it
was
too
high
and
there
were
no
projecting
balconies
to
serve
as
it
was
a
very
unpleasant
experience
we
were
giving
a
ball
at
the
quai
a
few
nights
afterward
and
had
also
asked
a
great
many
people
all
the
ambassadors
sent
in
very
large
lists
of
invitations
they
wanted
for
their
compatriots
but
much
the
largest
was
that
sent
in
by
the
american
minister
the
invitations
sent
to
the
united
states
legation
as
it
was
then
were
something
fabulous
it
seemed
to
me
the
whole
of
the
united
states
were
in
paris
and
expecting
to
be
entertained
it
is
a
very
difficult
position
for
the
american
representative
on
these
occasions
everybody
ca
be
invited
to
the
various
entertainments
and
distinctions
are
very
hard
to
make
we
had
some
amusing
experiences
had
a
letter
from
one
of
his
english
friends
lord
saying
he
was
coming
to
paris
for
the
fêtes
with
his
two
daughters
and
he
would
like
very
much
to
be
invited
to
some
of
the
parties
at
the
elysee
and
the
ministries
replied
saying
he
would
do
what
he
could
and
added
that
we
were
to
have
two
large
dinners
and
receptions
one
with
the
comédie
française
afterward
and
one
with
music
which
one
would
they
come
to
lord
promptly
replied
to
both
it
was
funny
but
really
did
make
any
difference
when
you
have
a
hundred
people
to
dinner
you
can
quite
easily
have
a
hundred
and
three
and
in
such
large
parties
arranged
weeks
beforehand
some
one
always
gives
out
at
the
last
moment
we
had
a
great
many
discussions
in
cabinet
with
two
of
his
secretaries
who
were
especially
occupied
with
the
invitations
for
our
ball
the
parliament
of
course
le
peuple
souverain
was
invited
but
it
was
a
different
question
for
the
women
wives
of
the
senators
and
deputies
we
finally
arrived
at
a
solution
by
inviting
only
the
wives
i
knew
we
had
an
indignant
response
from
one
gentleman
député
ne
valsant
sa
femme
a
de
renvoyer
la
carte
que
le
ministre
des
affaires
etrangères
et
madame
waddington
lui
ont
adressée
pour
la
soirée
du
deputy
who
waltzes
only
with
his
wife
has
the
honour
to
send
back
the
card
of
invitation
which
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
madame
waddington
have
sent
to
him
for
the
party
of
the
it
was
unanimously
decided
that
the
couple
must
be
invited
a
gentleman
who
went
to
balls
only
to
dance
with
his
wife
must
be
encouraged
in
such
exemplary
behaviour
another
was
funny
too
in
a
different
style
madame
étant
au
ciel
depuis
quelques
années
ne
pourrait
pas
se
rendre
à
la
gracieuse
invitation
que
le
ministre
des
affaires
etrangères
et
madame
waddington
ont
bien
voulu
lui
adresser
monsieur
rendra
avec
madame
being
in
heaven
for
some
years
can
not
accept
the
amiable
invitation
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
madame
waddington
will
come
with
pleasure
we
kept
the
letters
in
our
archives
with
many
other
curious
specimens
the
house
was
given
over
to
workmen
the
last
two
or
three
days
before
the
ball
with
the
remembrance
of
the
staircase
at
versailles
in
our
minds
we
were
most
anxious
to
have
no
contretemps
of
any
kind
to
interfere
with
our
entertainment
both
entrances
were
arranged
and
the
old
elevator
which
had
not
worked
for
years
was
put
in
order
it
had
been
suggested
once
or
twice
that
i
should
use
it
but
as
i
always
had
heard
a
gruesome
tale
of
madame
drouyn
de
when
her
husband
was
foreign
minister
hanging
in
space
for
four
or
five
hours
between
the
two
floors
i
was
not
inclined
to
repeat
that
experience
my
recollection
of
the
lower
entrance
and
staircase
which
we
never
used
was
of
rather
a
dark
grimy
corner
and
i
was
amazed
the
morning
of
the
ball
to
see
the
transformation
draperies
tapestries
flags
and
green
plants
had
done
wonders
and
the
elevator
looked
quite
charming
with
red
velvet
hangings
and
cushions
i
do
think
any
one
used
it
we
had
asked
our
guests
at
as
the
princes
said
they
would
come
at
ten
i
was
ready
about
nine
and
thought
i
would
go
by
the
lower
entrance
so
as
to
have
a
look
at
the
staircase
and
all
the
rooms
before
any
one
came
there
was
already
such
a
crowd
in
the
rooms
that
i
could
get
through
even
my
faithful
gérard
could
not
make
a
passage
we
were
obliged
to
send
for
two
huissiers
who
with
some
difficulty
made
room
for
me
and
his
staff
were
already
in
the
salon
réservé
giving
final
instructions
the
servants
told
us
that
since
eight
there
had
been
a
crowd
at
the
doors
which
they
opened
a
little
before
nine
and
a
flood
of
people
poured
in
the
salon
réservé
had
a
blue
ribbon
stretched
across
the
entrance
from
door
to
door
and
was
guarded
by
huissiers
old
hands
who
knew
everybody
in
the
diplomatic
and
official
world
and
would
not
let
any
one
in
who
had
a
right
to
penetrate
into
the
charmed
circle
which
of
course
became
the
one
room
where
every
one
wanted
to
go
there
were
too
one
or
two
members
of
cabinet
always
stationed
near
the
doors
to
see
that
instructions
were
obeyed
i
do
think
the
salon
réservé
exists
any
more
the
blue
ribbon
certainly
not
the
rising
flood
of
democracy
and
equality
submit
to
any
such
barrier
i
remember
quite
well
one
beautiful
woman
standing
for
some
time
just
the
wrong
side
of
the
ribbon
she
was
so
beautiful
that
every
one
remarked
her
but
she
had
no
official
rank
or
claim
of
any
kind
to
enter
the
salon
réservé
no
one
knew
her
though
every
one
was
asking
who
she
was
she
finally
made
her
entrée
into
the
room
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
a
young
secretary
one
of
her
friends
who
could
not
refuse
her
what
she
wanted
so
much
she
was
certainly
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
room
with
the
exception
of
the
actual
queen
alexandra
who
was
always
the
most
beautiful
and
distinguished
wherever
she
was
the
royalties
did
dance
much
we
had
the
regular
quadrille
with
the
princes
and
princesses
of
wales
denmark
sweden
countess
of
flanders
and
others
none
of
the
french
princes
came
to
the
ball
there
was
a
great
crowd
but
as
the
distinguished
guests
remained
all
the
time
in
the
salon
réservé
they
were
not
inconvenienced
by
it
just
before
supper
which
was
served
at
little
round
tables
in
a
room
opening
out
of
the
rotonde
the
late
king
of
denmark
then
crown
prince
brother
of
the
princess
of
wales
told
me
he
would
like
to
go
and
see
all
the
rooms
he
had
always
heard
that
the
palais
was
a
beautiful
house
we
made
a
difficult
but
stately
progress
through
the
rooms
the
staircase
was
a
pretty
sight
covered
with
a
red
carpet
tapestries
on
the
walls
and
quantities
of
pretty
women
of
all
nationalities
grouped
on
the
steps
we
walked
through
the
rooms
where
there
were
just
as
many
people
as
there
were
an
orchestra
people
dancing
just
like
another
party
going
on
we
halted
a
few
minutes
in
my
petit
salon
at
the
end
of
the
long
suite
of
rooms
it
looked
quite
charming
with
the
blue
brocade
walls
and
quantities
of
pink
roses
standing
in
high
glass
vases
i
suggested
taking
the
elevator
to
go
down
but
the
prince
preferred
walking
so
did
i
it
was
even
more
difficult
getting
through
the
crowd
we
had
the
whole
length
of
the
house
to
cross
several
women
stood
on
chairs
as
we
passed
along
in
the
hope
of
seeing
one
of
the
princesses
but
they
had
wisely
remained
in
the
salon
réservé
and
were
afraid
to
venture
into
the
crowd
supper
was
a
serious
preoccupation
for
the
young
secretaries
of
the
ministry
who
had
much
difficulty
in
keeping
that
room
private
long
before
the
supper
hour
some
enterprising
spirits
had
discovered
that
the
royalties
were
to
sup
in
that
room
and
finding
the
secretaries
quite
inaccessible
to
any
suggestions
of
people
who
had
a
right
to
come
in
presidents
of
commissions
and
various
other
distinctions
had
recourse
to
the
servants
and
various
gold
pieces
circulated
which
however
did
not
accomplish
their
object
the
secretaries
said
that
they
had
more
trouble
with
the
chamberlains
of
the
various
princes
than
with
the
princes
themselves
they
all
wanted
to
sup
in
the
private
room
and
were
much
more
tenacious
of
having
a
good
place
or
the
place
they
thought
was
due
to
them
than
their
royal
masters
the
supper
was
very
gay
the
prince
of
wales
the
late
king
edward
perfectly
charming
talking
to
every
one
remembering
every
one
with
that
extraordinary
gracious
manner
which
made
him
friends
in
all
classes
immediately
after
supper
the
princes
and
distinguished
strangers
and
departed
i
remained
about
an
hour
longer
and
went
to
have
a
look
at
the
ballroom
it
was
still
crowded
people
dancing
hard
and
when
finally
about
two
i
retreated
to
my
own
quarters
i
went
to
sleep
to
the
sound
of
waltzes
and
dance
music
played
by
the
two
orchestras
the
revelry
continued
pretty
well
all
through
the
night
whenever
i
woke
i
heard
strains
of
music
supper
went
on
till
seven
in
the
morning
our
faithful
kruft
told
us
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
left
on
the
tables
and
they
had
almost
to
force
the
people
out
telling
them
that
an
invitation
to
a
ball
did
not
usually
extend
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
there
was
a
grand
official
closing
of
the
exposition
at
the
end
of
november
with
a
distribution
of
prizes
the
city
still
very
full
and
very
gay
escorts
and
uniforms
in
every
direction
the
brilliant
with
soldiers
equipages
of
all
descriptions
and
all
the
afternoon
a
crowd
of
people
sitting
under
the
trees
much
interested
in
all
that
was
going
on
particularly
when
carriages
would
pass
with
people
in
foreign
and
striking
costumes
the
chinese
always
wore
their
costume
the
big
yellow
birds
of
paradise
became
quite
a
feature
of
the
afternoon
défilé
an
indian
princess
too
dressed
entirely
in
white
a
soft
clinging
material
with
a
white
veil
over
her
face
and
held
in
place
by
a
gold
band
going
around
the
head
was
always
much
admired
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
great
clatter
of
and
jingling
sabres
when
an
escort
of
dragoons
would
pass
escorting
some
foreign
prince
to
the
elysée
to
pay
his
formal
visit
to
the
marshal
everybody
looked
gay
french
people
so
dearly
love
a
show
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
interest
every
one
took
in
the
steady
stream
of
people
from
the
fashionable
woman
driving
to
the
bois
in
her
victoria
to
the
workmen
who
would
stand
in
groups
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
some
of
them
occasionally
with
a
child
on
their
shoulders
frenchmen
of
all
classes
are
good
to
children
on
a
sunday
or
fête
day
when
whole
families
are
coming
in
from
a
day
at
the
bois
one
often
sees
a
young
husband
wheeling
a
or
carrying
a
baby
in
his
arms
to
let
the
poor
mother
have
a
rest
it
was
curious
at
the
end
of
the
exposition
to
see
how
quickly
everything
was
removed
many
things
had
been
sold
and
in
a
few
days
the
champ
de
mars
took
again
the
same
aspect
it
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
may
heavy
carts
and
camions
everywhere
oceans
of
mud
lines
of
black
holes
where
trees
and
poles
had
been
planted
and
the
same
groups
of
small
shivering
southerners
all
huddled
together
wrapped
in
wonderful
cloaks
and
blankets
quite
paralysed
with
cold
i
do
know
if
the
exposition
was
a
financial
success
i
should
think
probably
not
a
great
deal
of
money
came
into
france
but
the
french
spent
enormously
in
their
preparations
but
the
moral
effect
was
certainly
good
all
the
world
flocked
to
paris
cabs
and
river
steamers
did
a
flourishing
business
as
did
all
the
restaurants
and
cafés
in
the
suburbs
st
cloud
meudon
versailles
robinson
were
crowded
every
night
with
people
who
were
thirsting
for
air
and
food
after
long
hot
days
in
the
dust
and
struggles
of
the
exposition
we
dined
there
once
or
twice
but
it
was
certainly
neither
pleasant
nor
comfortable
even
in
the
most
expensive
restaurants
they
were
all
overcrowded
very
bad
service
badly
lighted
and
generally
bad
food
there
were
various
national
repasts
russian
italian
but
i
never
participated
in
any
of
those
except
once
at
the
american
restaurant
where
i
had
a
very
good
breakfast
one
morning
with
delicious
waffles
made
by
a
negro
cook
i
was
rather
glad
when
the
exhibition
was
over
one
had
a
feeling
that
one
ought
to
see
as
much
as
possible
and
there
were
some
beautiful
things
but
it
was
most
fatiguing
struggling
through
the
crowd
and
we
invariably
lost
the
carriage
and
found
ourselves
at
the
wrong
entrance
and
had
to
wait
hours
for
a
cab
tiffany
had
a
great
success
with
the
french
many
of
my
friends
bought
souvenirs
of
the
exposition
from
him
his
work
was
very
original
fanciful
and
quite
different
from
the
rather
stiff
heavy
classic
silver
that
one
sees
in
this
country

waddington
as
prime
minister
there
had
been
a
respite
a
sort
of
armed
truce
in
political
circles
as
long
as
the
exposition
lasted
but
when
the
chambers
met
again
in
november
it
was
evident
that
things
were
not
going
smoothly
the
republicans
and
radicals
were
dissatisfied
every
day
there
were
speeches
and
insinuations
against
the
marshal
and
his
government
and
one
felt
that
a
crisis
was
impending
there
were
not
loaves
and
fishes
enough
for
the
whole
radical
party
if
one
listened
to
them
it
would
seem
as
if
every
préfet
and
every
general
were
conspiring
against
the
republic
there
were
long
consultations
in
cabinet
and
i
went
often
to
our
house
in
the
rue
dumont
to
see
if
everything
was
in
order
there
as
i
quite
expected
to
be
back
there
for
christmas
a
climax
was
reached
when
the
marshal
was
asked
to
sign
the
deposition
of
some
of
the
generals
he
absolutely
refused
the
ministers
persisted
in
their
demands
there
was
not
much
discussion
the
marshal
mind
was
made
up
and
on
the
of
january
he
announced
in
the
conseil
des
ministres
his
irrevocable
decision
and
handed
his
ministers
his
letter
of
resignation
we
had
a
melancholy
breakfast
count
de
and
i
the
last
day
of
the
marshal
presidency
was
very
blue
was
quite
sure
the
marshal
would
resign
and
foresaw
all
sorts
of
complications
both
at
home
and
abroad
the
day
was
gloomy
too
grey
and
cold
even
the
big
rooms
of
the
ministry
were
dark
as
soon
as
they
had
started
for
versailles
i
took
baby
and
went
to
mother
as
i
went
over
the
bridge
i
wondered
how
many
more
times
i
should
cross
it
and
whether
the
end
of
the
week
would
see
me
settled
again
in
my
own
house
we
drove
about
and
had
tea
together
and
i
got
back
to
the
quai
about
six
neither
nor
count
de
had
got
back
from
versailles
but
there
were
two
telegrams
the
first
one
to
say
that
the
marshal
had
resigned
the
second
one
that
grévy
was
named
in
his
place
with
a
large
majority
illustration
jules
grevy
reading
marshal
macmahon
letter
of
resignation
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
from
february
was
rather
depressed
when
he
came
home
he
had
always
a
great
sympathy
and
respect
for
the
marshal
and
was
very
sorry
to
see
him
go
thought
his
departure
would
complicate
foreign
affairs
as
long
as
the
marshal
was
at
the
elysee
foreign
governments
were
not
afraid
of
coups
or
revolutions
he
was
also
sorry
that
dufaure
would
not
remain
but
he
was
an
old
man
had
had
enough
of
political
life
and
party
struggles
left
the
field
to
younger
men
the
marshal
letter
was
communicated
at
once
to
the
parliament
and
the
houses
met
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
short
session
to
hear
the
marshal
letter
read
by
grévy
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
the
two
houses
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
were
convoked
for
a
later
hour
of
the
same
afternoon
there
was
not
much
excitement
two
or
three
names
were
pronounced
but
every
one
felt
sure
that
grévy
would
be
the
man
he
was
nominated
by
a
large
majority
and
the
republicans
were
jubilant
thought
the
republic
was
at
last
established
on
a
firm
and
proper
basis
grévy
was
perfectly
calm
and
did
not
show
much
enthusiasm
he
must
have
felt
quite
sure
from
the
first
moment
that
he
would
be
named
his
first
visitor
was
the
marshal
who
wished
him
all
possible
success
in
his
new
mission
and
if
grévy
was
pleased
to
be
the
president
of
the
republic
the
marshal
was
even
more
pleased
not
to
be
and
to
take
up
his
private
life
again
there
were
many
speculations
as
to
who
would
be
charged
by
grévy
to
form
his
first
cabinet
and
almost
permanent
meetings
in
all
the
groups
of
the
left
friends
all
said
he
would
certainly
remain
at
the
foreign
office
but
that
depended
naturally
upon
the
choice
of
the
premier
if
he
were
taken
from
the
more
advanced
ranks
of
the
left
could
not
possibly
stay
we
were
not
long
in
suspense
had
one
or
two
interviews
with
grévy
which
resulted
in
his
remaining
at
the
foreign
office
but
as
prime
minister
hesitated
at
first
felt
that
it
would
not
be
an
easy
task
to
keep
all
those
very
conflicting
elements
together
there
were
four
protestants
in
the
ministry
léon
say
de
freycinet
and
le
royer
jules
ferry
who
took
the
ministry
of
public
instruction
a
very
clever
man
was
practically
a
freethinker
and
the
parliament
was
decidedly
more
advanced
the
last
elections
had
given
a
strong
republican
majority
to
the
senate
he
consulted
with
his
brother
richard
waddington
then
a
deputy
afterward
a
senator
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
rouen
and
some
of
his
friends
and
finally
decided
to
accept
the
very
honourable
but
very
onerous
position
and
remained
at
the
foreign
affairs
with
grévy
as
prime
minister
if
i
had
seen
little
of
him
before
i
saw
nothing
of
him
now
as
his
work
was
exactly
doubled
we
did
breakfast
together
but
it
was
a
most
irregular
meal
sometimes
at
twelve
sometimes
at
and
very
rarely
alone
we
always
dined
out
or
had
people
dining
with
us
so
that
family
life
became
a
dream
of
the
past
we
very
rarely
went
together
when
we
dined
out
was
always
late
his
coupé
waited
hours
in
the
court
i
had
my
carriage
and
went
alone
after
eight
or
ten
days
of
irregular
meals
at
impossible
hours
we
often
dined
at
i
said
to
count
de
chef
de
cabinet
ca
you
arrange
to
have
business
over
a
little
earlier
it
is
awful
to
dine
so
late
and
to
wait
so
long
to
which
he
replied
ah
madame
no
one
can
be
more
desirous
than
i
to
change
that
order
of
things
for
when
the
minister
dines
at
the
chef
de
cabinet
gets
his
dinner
at
we
did
manage
to
get
rather
more
satisfactory
hours
after
a
little
while
but
it
was
always
difficult
to
extract
from
his
work
if
it
were
anything
important
he
became
absorbed
and
absolutely
unconscious
of
time
the
new
president
grévy
installed
himself
at
once
at
the
elysée
with
his
wife
and
daughter
there
was
much
speculation
about
madame
grévy
no
one
had
ever
seen
her
she
was
absolutely
unknown
when
grévy
was
president
of
the
national
assembly
he
gave
very
pleasant
dinners
where
madame
grévy
never
appeared
every
one
of
all
opinions
was
delighted
to
go
to
him
and
the
talk
was
most
brilliant
and
interesting
grévy
was
a
perfect
host
very
cultivated
with
a
marvellous
memory
quoting
pages
of
the
classics
french
and
latin
madame
grévy
was
always
spoken
of
as
a
quiet
unpretending
person
occupied
with
domestic
duties
who
hated
society
and
never
went
anywhere
in
fact
no
one
ever
heard
her
name
mentioned
a
great
many
people
did
know
that
grévy
had
a
wife
when
her
husband
became
president
of
the
republic
there
was
much
discussion
as
to
madame
grévy
social
status
in
the
official
world
i
do
think
grévy
wanted
her
to
appear
nor
to
take
any
part
in
the
new
life
and
she
certainly
did
want
to
nothing
in
her
former
life
had
prepared
her
for
such
a
change
and
it
was
always
an
effort
for
her
but
both
were
overruled
by
their
friends
who
thought
a
woman
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
position
it
was
some
little
time
before
they
were
settled
at
the
elysée
asked
grévy
once
or
twice
when
madame
waddington
might
call
upon
his
wife
and
he
answered
that
as
soon
as
they
were
quite
installed
i
should
receive
a
notice
one
day
a
communication
arrived
from
the
elysee
saying
that
madame
grévy
would
receive
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
ministers
wives
on
a
fixed
day
at
five
the
message
was
sent
on
to
the
diplomatic
corps
and
when
i
arrived
on
the
appointed
day
early
as
i
wanted
to
see
the
people
come
in
and
also
thought
i
must
present
the
foreign
ladies
there
were
already
several
carriages
in
the
court
illustration
jules
grévy
elected
president
of
the
republic
by
the
senate
and
chamber
of
deputies
meeting
as
the
national
assembly
from
february
the
elysee
looked
just
as
it
did
in
the
marshal
time
plenty
of
servants
in
gala
liveries
two
or
three
huissiers
who
knew
everybody
palms
flowers
everywhere
the
traditions
of
the
palace
are
carried
on
from
one
president
to
another
and
a
permanent
staff
of
servants
remains
we
found
madame
grévy
with
her
daughter
and
one
or
two
ladies
wives
i
suppose
of
the
secretaries
seated
in
the
with
the
beautiful
tapestries
madame
grévy
in
a
large
gold
armchair
at
the
end
of
the
room
a
row
of
gilt
armchairs
on
each
side
of
hers
mademoiselle
standing
behind
her
mother
a
huissier
announced
every
one
distinctly
but
the
names
and
titles
said
nothing
to
madame
grévy
she
was
tall
handsomely
dressed
and
visibly
nervous
made
a
great
many
gestures
when
she
talked
it
was
amusing
to
see
all
the
people
arrive
i
had
nothing
to
do
there
were
no
introductions
every
one
was
announced
and
they
all
walked
straight
up
to
madame
grévy
who
was
very
polite
got
up
for
every
one
men
and
women
it
was
rather
an
imposing
circle
that
gathered
around
her
princess
hohenlohe
german
ambassadress
sat
on
one
side
of
her
marquise
molins
spanish
ambassadress
on
the
other
there
were
not
many
men
lord
lyons
as
doyen
of
the
diplomatic
corps
the
nonce
and
a
good
many
representatives
of
the
south
american
republics
madame
grévy
was
perfectly
bewildered
and
did
try
to
talk
to
the
ladies
next
to
her
but
it
was
an
intimidating
function
for
any
one
and
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
as
they
were
all
quite
new
to
the
work
it
was
obviously
an
immense
relief
to
her
when
some
lady
of
the
official
world
came
in
whom
she
had
known
before
the
two
ladies
plunged
at
once
into
a
very
animated
conversation
about
their
children
husbands
and
various
domestic
matters
a
perfectly
natural
conversation
but
not
interesting
to
the
foreign
ladies
we
did
make
a
very
long
visit
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
form
lord
lyons
came
out
with
me
and
we
had
quite
a
talk
while
i
was
waiting
for
my
carriage
in
the
anteroom
he
was
so
sensible
always
in
his
intercourse
with
the
official
world
quite
realised
that
the
position
was
difficult
and
trying
for
madame
grévy
it
would
have
been
for
any
one
thrown
at
once
without
any
preparation
into
such
perfectly
different
surroundings
he
had
a
certain
experience
of
republics
and
republican
manners
as
he
had
been
some
years
in
washington
as
british
minister
and
had
often
seen
wives
of
american
statesmen
and
ministers
fresh
from
the
far
west
beginning
their
career
in
washington
quite
bewildered
by
the
novelty
of
everything
and
utterly
ignorant
of
all
questions
of
etiquette
only
he
said
the
american
women
were
far
more
adaptable
than
either
french
or
english
or
than
any
others
in
the
world
in
fact
he
also
said
that
day
and
i
have
heard
him
repeat
it
once
or
twice
since
that
he
had
met
a
stupid
american
woman
i
have
always
thought
it
was
unnecessary
to
insist
upon
madame
presence
at
the
elysée
it
is
very
difficult
for
any
woman
no
longer
very
young
to
begin
an
entirely
new
life
in
a
perfectly
different
milieu
and
certainly
more
difficult
for
a
frenchwoman
of
the
bourgeoisie
than
any
other
they
live
in
such
a
narrow
circle
their
lives
are
so
cramped
and
uninteresting
they
know
so
little
of
society
and
foreign
ways
and
manners
that
they
must
be
often
uncomfortable
and
make
mistakes
it
is
very
different
for
a
man
all
the
small
questions
of
dress
and
manners
do
exist
for
him
one
man
in
a
dress
coat
and
white
cravat
looks
very
like
another
and
men
of
all
conditions
are
polite
to
a
lady
when
a
man
is
intelligent
no
one
notices
whether
his
coat
and
are
too
wide
or
too
short
and
whether
his
boots
are
clumsy
madame
grévy
never
looked
happy
at
the
elysée
they
had
a
big
dinner
every
thursday
with
a
reception
afterward
and
she
looked
so
tired
when
she
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
diplomatic
salon
making
conversation
for
the
foreigners
and
people
of
all
kinds
who
came
to
their
receptions
that
one
felt
really
sorry
for
her
grévy
was
always
a
striking
personality
he
had
a
fine
head
a
quiet
dignified
manner
and
looked
very
well
when
he
stood
at
the
door
receiving
his
guests
i
think
he
cared
very
much
about
foreign
affairs
he
was
essentially
french
had
never
lived
abroad
or
known
any
foreigners
he
was
too
intelligent
not
to
understand
that
a
country
must
have
foreign
relations
and
that
france
must
take
her
place
again
as
a
great
power
but
home
politics
interested
him
much
more
than
anything
else
he
was
a
charming
talker
every
one
wanted
to
talk
to
him
or
rather
to
listen
to
him
the
evenings
were
pleasant
enough
in
the
diplomatic
salon
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
attitude
of
the
different
diplomatists
all
were
correct
but
most
of
them
were
visibly
antagonistic
to
the
republic
and
the
republicans
which
they
considered
much
accentuée
since
the
nomination
of
grévy
the
women
rather
more
so
than
the
men
one
felt
if
one
did
hear
the
criticisms
on
the
dress
deportment
and
general
style
of
the
republican
ladies
illustration
the
elysée
palace
paris
i
did
quite
understand
their
view
of
the
situation
they
were
all
delighted
to
come
to
paris
and
knew
perfectly
well
the
state
of
things
what
an
abyss
existed
between
all
the
conservative
party
royalists
and
bonapartists
and
the
republican
but
the
absence
of
a
court
did
make
any
difference
in
their
position
they
went
to
all
the
entertainments
given
in
the
faubourg
germain
and
all
the
société
came
to
theirs
with
very
few
exceptions
they
did
only
what
was
necessary
in
the
way
of
intercourse
with
the
official
world
i
think
they
made
a
mistake
both
for
themselves
and
their
governments
france
was
passing
through
an
entirely
new
phase
everything
was
changing
many
young
intelligent
men
were
coming
to
the
front
and
there
were
interesting
and
able
discussions
in
the
chambers
and
in
the
salons
of
the
republican
ministers
and
deputies
i
dare
say
the
new
theories
of
liberty
and
equality
were
not
sympathetic
to
the
trained
representatives
of
courts
but
the
world
was
advancing
democracy
was
in
the
air
and
one
would
have
thought
it
would
have
interested
foreigners
to
follow
the
movement
and
to
judge
for
themselves
whether
the
young
republic
had
any
chance
of
life
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
public
man
not
wishing
to
hear
all
sides
of
a
question
but
i
think
in
the
beginning
there
was
such
a
distrust
and
dislike
to
the
republic
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
things
fairly
i
do
know
that
it
mattered
very
much
in
these
days
of
rapid
travelling
and
telephone
an
rôle
is
much
less
important
than
in
the
old
days
when
an
ambassador
with
his
numerous
suite
of
secretaries
and
servants
travelling
by
post
would
be
days
on
the
road
before
reaching
his
destination
and
when
all
sorts
of
things
might
happen
kingdoms
and
dynasties
be
overthrown
in
the
interval
now
all
the
great
measures
and
negotiations
are
discussed
and
settled
in
the
various
chancelleries
the
ambassador
merely
transmits
his
instructions
i
think
the
women
were
rather
more
uncompromising
than
the
men
one
day
in
my
there
was
a
lively
political
discussion
going
on
and
one
heard
all
the
phrases
le
gouvernement
infect
no
gentleman
could
serve
the
republic
etc
i
was
paying
much
attention
never
did
i
had
become
accustomed
to
that
style
of
conversation
and
knew
exactly
what
they
were
all
going
to
say
when
i
heard
one
of
my
friends
an
married
to
a
frenchman
of
very
good
old
family
make
the
following
statement
toute
la
canaille
est
républicaine
that
was
really
too
much
and
i
answered
vous
êtes
bien
indulgente
pour
when
one
thinks
of
the
unscrupulous
not
to
use
a
stronger
term
and
needy
adventurers
who
made
the
coup
and
played
a
great
part
in
the
court
of
the
second
empire
it
was
really
a
little
startling
to
be
told
that
the
republicans
enjoyed
the
monopoly
of
the
canaille
however
i
suppose
nothing
is
so
useless
as
a
political
discussion
except
perhaps
a
religious
one
no
one
ever
converts
any
one
else
i
have
always
heard
it
said
that
the
best
political
speech
never
changed
a
vote
the
first
person
who
entertained
grévy
was
prince
hohenlohe
the
german
ambassador
they
had
a
brilliant
reception
rooms
crowded
all
the
official
world
and
a
fair
contingent
from
the
faubourg
germain
the
president
brought
his
daughter
with
him
madame
grévy
never
accepted
any
invitations
and
they
walked
through
the
rooms
mademoiselle
declining
the
arm
of
count
wesdehlen
first
secretary
of
the
german
embassy
however
she
was
finally
prevailed
upon
to
abandon
the
paternal
support
and
then
wesdehlen
installed
her
in
a
small
salon
where
mollard
introducteur
des
ambassadeurs
took
charge
of
her
and
introduced
a
great
many
men
to
her
no
woman
would
ask
to
be
introduced
to
an
unmarried
woman
and
that
of
course
made
her
position
difficult
the
few
ladies
she
had
already
seen
at
the
elysée
came
up
to
speak
to
her
but
stay
near
her
so
she
was
really
receiving
almost
alone
with
mollard
grévy
was
in
another
room
très
entouré
as
he
always
was
the
diplomatic
corps
did
not
spare
their
criticisms
madame
grévy
received
every
saturday
in
the
afternoon
and
i
went
often
not
every
time
it
was
a
funny
collection
of
people
some
queerly
dressed
women
and
one
or
two
men
in
dress
coats
and
white
cravats
always
a
sprinkling
of
diplomatists
prince
orloff
was
often
there
and
if
anybody
could
have
made
that
stiff
shy
semicircle
of
women
comfortable
he
would
have
done
it
with
his
extraordinary
ease
of
manner
and
great
habit
of
the
world
gambetta
was
installed
in
the
course
of
the
month
at
the
palais
bourbon
next
to
us
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
every
night
and
my
chef
told
me
one
of
his
friends
an
excellent
cook
was
engaged
and
that
there
would
be
a
great
many
dinners
the
palais
bourbon
had
seen
great
entertainments
in
former
days
when
the
famous
duc
de
morny
was
président
de
la
chambre
des
députés
under
napoleon
iii
his
entertainments
were
famous
the
whole
world
fashionable
political
and
diplomatic
thronged
his
salons
and
invitations
were
eagerly
sought
for
not
only
by
the
french
people
but
by
the
many
foreigners
who
passed
through
paris
at
that
time
gambetta
must
have
been
a
curious
contrast
to
the
duc
de
morny
we
went
to
see
a
first
function
at
the
elysée
some
time
in
february
two
cardinals
were
to
be
named
and
grévy
was
to
deliver
the
birettas
mollard
asked
to
see
me
one
morning
telling
me
that
the
two
ablegates
with
their
suite
had
arrived
and
wished
to
pay
their
respects
to
me
one
of
them
was
monsignor
cataldi
whom
we
had
known
well
in
rome
when
we
were
living
there
he
was
a
friend
of
my
brother
general
rufus
king
the
last
united
states
minister
to
the
vatican
under
pia
nono
and
came
often
to
the
house
he
was
much
excited
when
he
found
out
that
madame
waddington
was
the
mary
king
he
had
known
so
well
in
rome
he
had
with
him
an
english
priest
whose
name
curiously
enough
was
english
they
appeared
about
and
were
quite
charming
cataldi
just
as
fat
and
cheerful
and
talkative
as
i
remembered
him
in
the
old
days
in
rome
we
plunged
at
once
into
all
sorts
of
memories
of
old
times
the
good
old
times
when
rome
was
small
and
black
and
interesting
something
quite
apart
and
different
from
any
other
place
in
the
world
monsignor
english
was
much
younger
and
more
reserved
the
type
a
contrast
to
the
exuberant
southerners
we
asked
them
to
dine
the
next
night
and
were
able
to
get
a
few
interesting
people
to
meet
them
comte
et
comtesse
de
sartiges
and
one
or
two
deputies
sartiges
was
formerly
french
ambassador
in
rome
to
the
vatican
and
a
very
clever
diplomatist
he
was
very
autocratic
did
exactly
what
he
liked
i
remember
quite
well
some
of
his
small
dances
at
the
embassy
the
invitations
were
from
ten
to
twelve
and
at
twelve
precisely
the
musicians
stopped
playing
no
matter
who
was
dancing
the
ball
was
over
his
wife
was
an
american
from
boston
miss
thorndike
who
always
retained
the
simple
natural
manner
of
the
american
their
son
the
vicomte
de
sartiges
has
followed
in
his
father
footsteps
and
is
one
of
the
most
serious
and
intelligent
of
the
young
diplomatists
cataldi
made
himself
very
agreeable
spoke
french
perfectly
well
though
with
a
strong
italian
accent
he
confided
to
me
after
dinner
that
he
would
have
liked
to
see
some
of
the
more
advanced
political
men
instead
of
the
very
conservative
catholics
we
had
invited
to
meet
them
i
know
what
these
gentlemen
think
i
would
like
to
talk
to
some
of
the
others
those
who
think
clericalism
and
who
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
soutane
serves
as
a
cloak
for
all
sorts
of
underhand
and
unpatriotic
dealings
i
can
only
see
them
abroad
never
in
rome
he
would
have
talked
to
them
quite
easily
italians
have
so
much
natural
tact
in
discussing
difficult
questions
never
irritate
people
unnecessarily
enjoyed
his
evening
he
had
never
been
in
rome
nor
known
many
romans
and
it
amused
him
to
see
how
skilfully
cataldi
who
was
a
devoted
admirer
of
leo
xiii
avoided
all
and
difficult
questions
saying
only
what
he
intended
to
say
and
appreciating
all
that
was
said
to
him
henrietta
and
i
were
very
anxious
to
see
the
ceremony
at
the
elysée
and
asked
mollard
introducteur
des
ambassadeurs
and
chef
du
protocole
a
most
important
man
on
all
official
occasions
if
he
could
put
us
somewhere
in
a
corner
where
we
could
see
without
taking
any
part
was
of
no
use
to
us
as
he
went
officially
in
uniform
madame
grévy
was
very
amiable
and
sent
us
an
invitation
to
breakfast
we
found
a
small
party
assembled
in
the
tapestry
salon
when
we
arrived
at
the
elysée
the
president
with
all
his
household
civil
and
military
madame
and
mademoiselle
grévy
three
or
four
ladies
wives
of
the
and
secretaries
also
several
prominent
ecclesiastics
among
them
monsignor
capel
an
english
priest
a
very
handsome
and
attractive
man
whom
we
had
known
well
in
rome
he
was
supposed
to
have
made
more
women
converts
to
catholicism
than
any
man
of
his
time
i
can
quite
understand
his
influence
with
women
there
was
something
very
natural
and
earnest
about
him
no
pose
i
had
not
seen
him
since
i
had
married
and
was
very
pleased
when
i
recognised
him
he
told
me
he
had
never
seen
was
most
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance
while
we
were
talking
came
in
looking
very
warm
and
uncomfortable
wearing
his
stiff
uniform
which
changed
him
very
much
i
introduced
capel
to
him
at
once
they
had
quite
a
talk
before
the
archbishops
and
ablegates
arrived
the
two
future
cardinals
monseigneur
pie
archbishop
of
poitiers
and
monseigneur
desprey
archbishop
of
toulouse
were
well
known
in
the
catholic
world
the
pope
choice
was
generally
approved
they
were
treated
with
all
due
ceremony
as
befitted
princes
of
the
church
one
of
the
elysée
carriages
always
very
well
turned
out
with
an
escort
of
cavalry
went
to
fetch
them
and
they
looked
very
stately
and
imposing
in
their
robes
when
they
came
into
the
room
where
we
were
waiting
they
were
very
different
monseigneur
pie
tall
thin
cold
arrogant
one
felt
it
was
a
trial
for
him
to
receive
his
cardinal
hat
from
the
hands
of
a
republican
president
monseigneur
desprey
had
a
kind
good
expression
i
do
think
he
liked
it
much
either
but
he
put
a
better
face
on
the
matter
both
cardinals
said
exactly
what
one
imagined
they
would
say
that
the
traditional
fidelity
of
france
to
the
church
should
be
supported
and
encouraged
in
every
way
in
these
troubled
days
of
indifference
to
religion
etc
one
felt
all
the
time
the
strong
antagonism
of
the
church
to
the
republic
grévy
answered
extremely
well
speaking
with
much
dignity
and
simplicity
and
assuring
the
cardinals
that
they
could
always
count
upon
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
head
of
the
state
in
favour
of
the
rights
of
the
church
i
was
quite
pleased
to
see
again
the
red
coats
and
high
boots
of
the
gardes
nobles
it
is
a
very
showy
dashing
uniform
the
two
young
men
were
and
wore
it
very
well
i
asked
to
have
them
presented
to
me
and
we
had
a
long
talk
over
old
days
in
rome
when
the
pope
went
out
every
day
to
the
different
villas
and
promenades
and
always
with
an
escort
of
gardes
nobles
i
invited
them
to
our
reception
two
or
three
nights
afterward
and
they
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
they
were
of
course
delighted
with
their
short
stay
in
paris
and
i
think
a
little
surprised
at
the
party
at
the
foreign
office
under
a
republican
régime
i
do
know
if
they
expected
to
find
the
rooms
filled
with
gentlemen
in
the
traditional
red
garibaldian
shirt
and
ladies
in
corresponding
simplicity
of
attire
illustration
her
majesty
queen
victoria
about
from
a
photograph
by
chancellor
dublin
we
saw
a
great
many
english
at
the
quai
queen
victoria
stayed
one
or
two
nights
at
the
british
embassy
passing
through
paris
on
her
way
south
she
sent
for
who
had
never
seen
her
since
his
undergraduate
days
at
cambridge
he
found
her
quite
charming
very
easy
interested
in
everything
she
began
the
conversation
in
french
he
was
announced
with
all
due
ceremony
as
monsieur
le
ministre
des
affaires
etrangères
and
said
she
spoke
it
remarkably
well
then
with
her
beautiful
smile
which
lightened
up
her
whole
face
i
think
i
can
speak
english
with
a
cambridge
scholar
she
was
much
interested
in
his
beginnings
in
england
at
rugby
and
cambridge
and
was
evidently
astonished
though
she
had
too
much
tact
to
show
it
that
he
had
chosen
to
make
his
life
and
career
in
france
instead
of
accepting
the
proposition
made
to
him
by
his
cousin
waddington
then
dean
of
durham
to
remain
in
england
and
continue
his
classic
and
literary
studies
under
his
guidance
when
the
interview
was
over
he
found
the
queen
faithful
scotch
retainer
john
brown
who
always
accompanied
her
everywhere
waiting
outside
the
door
evidently
hoping
to
see
the
minister
he
spoke
a
few
words
with
him
as
a
countryman
being
half
scotch
his
mother
was
born
chisholm
they
shook
hands
and
john
brown
begged
him
to
come
to
scotland
where
he
would
receive
a
hearty
welcome
was
very
pleased
with
his
reception
by
the
queen
lord
lyons
told
him
afterward
that
she
had
been
very
anxious
to
see
him
she
told
him
later
in
speaking
of
the
interview
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
realise
that
she
was
speaking
to
a
french
minister
everything
about
him
was
so
absolutely
english
figure
colouring
and
speech
many
old
school
and
college
experiences
were
evoked
that
year
by
the
various
english
who
passed
through
paris
one
night
at
a
big
dinner
at
the
british
embassy
i
was
sitting
next
to
the
prince
of
wales
late
king
edward
he
said
to
me
there
is
an
old
friend
of
your
husband
here
who
will
be
so
glad
to
see
him
again
they
have
met
since
he
was
his
fag
at
rugby
after
dinner
he
was
introduced
to
me
admiral
glynn
a
charming
man
said
his
last
recollection
of
was
making
his
toast
for
him
and
getting
a
good
cuff
when
the
toast
fell
into
the
fire
and
got
burnt
the
two
men
talked
together
for
some
time
in
the
recalling
all
sorts
of
schoolboy
exploits
another
school
friend
was
sir
francis
adams
first
secretary
and
counsellor
at
the
british
embassy
when
the
ambassador
took
his
holiday
adams
replaced
him
and
had
the
rank
and
title
of
minister
plenipotentiary
he
came
every
wednesday
the
diplomatic
reception
day
to
the
quai
to
talk
business
as
long
as
a
secretary
or
a
huissier
was
in
the
room
they
spoke
to
each
other
most
correctly
in
french
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
relapsed
into
easy
and
colloquial
english
we
were
very
fond
of
adams
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
not
only
in
paris
but
when
we
first
lived
in
london
at
the
embassy
he
died
suddenly
in
switzerland
and
missed
him
very
much
he
was
very
intelligent
a
keen
observer
had
been
all
over
the
world
and
his
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
foreign
countries
and
ways
was
often
very
useful
to
we
continued
our
dinners
and
receptions
which
always
interested
me
we
saw
so
many
people
of
all
kinds
one
dinner
was
for
prince
alexander
of
battenberg
just
as
he
was
starting
to
take
possession
of
the
new
principality
of
bulgaria
he
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
i
have
ever
seen
tall
young
strong
he
seemed
the
type
of
the
dashing
young
chief
who
would
inspire
confidence
in
a
new
independent
state
he
speak
of
his
future
with
much
enthusiasm
i
wonder
if
a
presentiment
was
even
then
overclouding
what
seemed
a
brilliant
beginning
he
talked
a
great
deal
at
dinner
he
was
just
back
from
rome
and
full
of
its
charm
which
at
once
made
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
report
said
he
had
left
his
heart
there
with
a
young
roman
he
certainly
spoke
of
the
happy
days
with
a
shade
of
melancholy
i
suggested
that
he
ought
to
marry
that
would
make
his
exile
as
he
called
it
easier
to
bear
ah
yes
if
one
could
choose
then
after
a
pause
with
an
almost
boyish
petulance
they
want
me
to
marry
princess
but
i
do
want
to
is
she
pretty
will
she
help
you
in
your
new
country
i
do
know
i
do
care
i
have
never
seen
her
poor
fellow
he
had
a
wretched
experience
some
of
the
exiles
were
less
interesting
a
lady
asked
to
see
me
one
day
to
enlist
my
sympathies
for
her
brother
and
plead
his
cause
with
the
minister
he
had
been
named
to
a
post
which
he
could
really
accept
i
rather
demurred
telling
her
messenger
one
of
the
secretaries
of
the
foreign
office
that
it
was
quite
useless
her
asking
me
to
interfere
was
not
very
likely
to
consult
me
in
his
choice
of
nominations
and
in
fact
the
small
appointments
secretaries
were
generally
prepared
in
the
chancellerie
and
followed
the
usual
routine
of
regular
promotion
an
ambassador
of
course
was
different
and
was
sometimes
taken
quite
outside
the
carrière
the
lady
persisted
and
appeared
one
morning
a
pretty
femme
du
monde
whom
i
had
often
met
without
making
her
acquaintance
she
plunged
at
once
into
her
subject
her
delicate
health
accustomed
to
all
the
comforts
and
what
the
books
call
higher
civilisation
of
europe
able
to
do
good
service
in
courts
and
society
as
he
knew
everybody
it
was
a
pity
to
send
him
to
such
an
place
with
an
awful
climate
any
consul
clerk
would
do
as
well
i
supposed
he
had
been
named
to
caracas
south
america
or
some
other
remote
and
unhealthy
part
of
the
globe
but
when
she
stopped
for
a
moment
i
discovered
that
the
young
man
was
named
to
washington
i
was
really
surprised
did
know
what
to
say
at
once
when
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
struck
me
and
i
answered
that
washington
was
far
perhaps
across
the
ocean
but
there
were
compensations
but
she
took
up
her
argument
again
such
an
impossible
place
everything
so
primitive
i
really
think
she
thought
the
youth
was
going
to
an
indian
settlement
all
squaws
and
wigwams
and
tomahawks
i
declined
any
interference
with
the
minister
appointments
assuring
her
i
had
no
influence
whatever
and
she
took
leave
of
me
very
icily
i
heard
the
sequel
afterward
the
young
man
refused
the
post
as
quite
unworthy
of
him
there
were
several
others
ready
and
pleased
to
take
it
and
de
was
put
en
disponibilité
we
saw
too
that
year
for
the
first
time
the
grand
duke
alexander
of
russia
later
emperor
alexander
iii
whose
coronation
we
went
to
at
moscow
and
the
grande
duchesse
marie
prince
orloff
arranged
the
interview
as
he
was
very
anxious
that
the
grand
duke
should
have
some
talk
with
they
were
in
paris
for
three
or
four
days
staying
at
the
hotel
bristol
where
they
received
us
he
was
a
tall
handsome
man
with
a
blond
beard
and
blue
eyes
quite
the
northern
type
she
recalled
her
sister
queen
alexandra
not
quite
so
tall
but
with
the
same
gracious
manner
and
beautiful
eyes
the
grand
duke
talked
a
great
deal
principally
politics
to
he
expressed
himself
very
doubtfully
about
the
stability
of
the
republic
and
was
evidently
worried
over
the
possibility
of
a
general
amnesty
a
very
dangerous
measure
which
no
government
should
sanction
assured
him
there
would
be
no
general
amnesty
but
he
seemed
sceptical
repeated
several
times
soyez
stable
soyez
ferme
the
grande
duchesse
talked
to
me
about
paris
the
streets
were
so
gay
the
shops
so
tempting
and
all
the
people
so
smiling
and
happy
i
suppose
the
contrast
struck
her
coming
from
russia
where
the
people
look
sad
and
listless
i
was
much
impressed
with
their
sad
repressed
look
when
we
were
in
russia
for
the
coronation
one
never
heard
people
laugh
or
sing
in
the
streets
and
yet
we
were
there
at
a
time
of
great
national
rejoicings
amusements
of
all
kinds
provided
for
the
people
their
national
melodies
volklieder
songs
of
the
people
have
always
a
strain
of
sadness
running
through
them
our
conversation
was
in
french
which
both
spoke
very
well
the
winter
months
went
by
quickly
enough
with
periodical
alarms
in
the
political
world
when
some
new
measure
was
discussed
which
aroused
everybody
passions
and
satisfied
neither
side
i
made
weekly
visits
to
my
own
house
which
was
never
dismantled
as
i
always
felt
our
stay
at
the
quai
would
not
last
much
longer
one
of
our
colleagues
madame
léon
say
an
intelligent
charming
woman
took
matters
more
philosophically
than
i
did
her
husband
had
been
in
and
out
of
office
so
often
that
she
was
quite
indifferent
to
sudden
changes
of
residence
they
too
kept
their
house
open
and
she
said
she
had
always
a
terrine
de
crise
ready
in
her
larders
the
diplomatic
appointments
the
embassies
particularly
were
a
difficulty
admiral
pothnau
went
to
london
he
was
a
very
gallant
officer
and
had
served
with
the
english
in
the
crimea
had
the
order
of
the
bath
and
exactly
that
pompous
manner
which
suits
english
people
general
chanzy
went
to
petersburg
it
has
been
the
tradition
almost
always
to
send
a
soldier
to
russia
there
is
so
little
intercourse
between
the
russian
emperor
and
any
foreigner
even
an
ambassador
that
an
ordinary
diplomatist
no
matter
how
intelligent
or
experienced
he
might
be
would
have
very
few
opportunities
to
talk
to
the
emperor
whereas
an
officer
with
the
various
reviews
and
manoeuvres
that
are
always
going
on
in
russia
would
surely
approach
him
more
easily
i
was
so
struck
when
we
were
in
russia
with
the
immense
distance
that
separated
the
princes
from
the
ordinary
mortals
they
seem
like
demigods
on
a
different
plane
in
russia
i
mean
of
course
when
they
come
to
paris
their
godlike
attributes
disappear
unfortunately
for
themselves
chanzy
was
very
happy
in
russia
where
he
was
extremely
well
received
he
dined
with
us
one
night
when
he
was
at
home
on
leave
and
was
most
enthusiastic
about
everything
in
russia
their
finances
their
army
the
women
of
all
classes
so
intelligent
so
patriotic
he
was
evidently
quite
sous
le
charme
when
he
had
gone
desprey
then
directeur
de
la
politique
a
very
clever
man
who
had
seen
many
ambassadors
come
and
go
from
all
the
capitals
of
europe
said
it
is
curious
how
all
the
ambassadors
who
go
to
russia
have
that
same
impression
i
have
never
known
it
to
fail
it
is
the
russian
policy
to
be
delightful
to
the
ambassadors
make
life
very
easy
for
them
show
them
all
that
is
brilliant
and
interesting
open
all
doors
society
etc
and
keep
all
sordid
and
ugly
questions
in
the
background
vallier
remained
at
berlin
his
name
had
been
mentioned
for
foreign
minister
when
dufaure
was
making
his
cabinet
but
he
had
the
health
for
it
and
i
think
preferred
being
in
berlin
he
knew
germany
well
and
had
a
good
many
friends
in
berlin
of
course
had
a
great
many
men
dinners
from
which
i
was
excluded
i
dined
often
with
some
of
my
friends
not
of
the
official
world
and
i
used
to
ask
myself
sometimes
if
the
quai
and
these
houses
could
be
in
the
same
country
it
was
an
entirely
different
world
every
point
of
view
different
not
only
politics
that
one
would
expect
as
the
whole
of
society
was
royalist
or
bonapartist
but
every
question
discussed
wore
a
different
aspect
once
or
twice
there
was
a
question
of
louis
xiv
and
what
he
would
have
done
in
certain
cases
the
religious
question
always
a
passionate
one
that
of
course
i
never
discussed
being
a
protestant
and
knowing
quite
well
that
the
real
fervent
catholics
think
protestants
have
no
religion
i
was
out
driving
with
a
friend
one
morning
in
lent
holy
week
thursday
i
think
and
said
i
could
not
be
out
late
as
i
must
go
to
church
perhaps
she
would
drop
me
at
the
protestant
chapel
in
the
avenue
de
la
grand
armée
she
was
so
absolutely
astonished
that
it
was
almost
funny
though
i
was
half
angry
too
you
are
going
to
church
on
holy
thursday
i
did
know
protestants
ever
kept
lent
or
holy
week
or
any
saint
day
do
you
think
we
ever
go
to
church
oh
yes
to
a
conference
or
sermon
on
sundays
but
you
are
not
pratiquant
like
us
i
was
really
put
out
and
tried
another
day
when
she
was
sitting
with
me
to
show
her
our
prayerbook
and
explained
that
the
creed
and
the
prayer
to
say
nothing
of
various
other
prayers
were
just
the
same
as
in
her
livre
de
messe
but
i
did
make
any
impression
upon
her
her
only
remark
being
i
suppose
you
do
believe
in
god
yet
she
was
a
clever
woman
knew
her
french
history
well
and
must
have
known
what
a
part
the
french
protestants
played
at
one
time
in
france
when
many
of
the
great
nobles
were
protestants
years
afterward
with
the
same
friend
we
were
discussing
the
proposed
marriage
of
the
duke
of
clarence
eldest
son
of
the
late
king
edward
vii
of
england
who
wanted
very
much
to
marry
princess
hélène
daughter
of
the
comte
de
paris
now
duchesse
it
was
impossible
for
the
english
prince
heir
to
the
throne
to
marry
a
catholic
princess
it
seemed
equally
impossible
for
the
french
princess
to
become
a
protestant
the
pope
was
consulted
and
very
strong
influence
brought
to
bear
on
the
question
but
the
catholic
church
was
firm
we
were
in
london
at
the
time
and
of
course
heard
the
question
much
discussed
it
was
an
interesting
case
as
the
two
young
people
were
much
in
love
with
each
other
i
said
to
my
friend
if
i
were
in
the
place
of
the
princess
hélène
i
should
make
myself
a
protestant
it
is
a
big
bait
for
the
daughter
of
an
exiled
prince
to
be
queen
of
england
but
it
could
be
no
catholic
could
change
her
religion
or
make
herself
protestant
yet
there
is
a
precedent
in
your
history
your
king
henri
iv
of
beloved
memory
a
protestant
did
hesitate
to
make
himself
a
catholic
to
be
king
of
france
ah
but
that
is
quite
different
for
you
perhaps
chère
amie
but
not
for
us
however
the
poor
young
prince
died
suddenly
of
pneumonia
so
the
sacrifice
would
have
been
in
vain
all
the
autumn
of
was
very
agitated
we
were
obliged
to
curtail
our
stay
at
bourneville
our
country
home
even
though
the
chambers
were
not
sitting
every
description
of
political
intrigue
was
going
on
every
day
had
an
immense
courrier
and
every
second
day
a
secretary
came
down
from
the
quai
with
despatches
and
papers
to
sign
telegrams
came
all
day
long
had
one
or
two
shooting
breakfasts
and
the
long
tramps
in
the
woods
rested
him
the
guests
were
generally
the
notabilities
of
the
small
towns
and
villages
of
his
circumscription
mayors
farmers
and
small
landowners
they
all
talked
politics
and
was
surprised
to
see
how
in
this
quiet
agricultural
district
the
fever
of
democracy
had
mounted
usually
the
farmer
is
very
conservative
looks
askance
at
the
very
advanced
opinions
of
the
young
radicals
but
a
complete
change
had
come
over
them
they
seemed
to
think
the
republic
founded
at
last
upon
a
solid
basis
supported
by
honest
republicans
would
bring
untold
prosperity
not
only
to
the
country
but
to
each
individual
and
many
very
modest
unpretending
citizens
of
the
small
towns
saw
themselves
conseilleurs
généraux
deputies
perhaps
even
ministers
it
was
a
curious
change
however
on
the
whole
the
people
in
our
part
of
the
world
were
reasonable
i
was
sorry
to
go
back
to
town
i
liked
the
last
beautiful
days
of
september
in
the
country
the
trees
were
just
beginning
to
turn
and
the
rides
in
the
woods
were
delightful
the
roads
so
soft
and
springy
the
horses
seemed
to
like
the
brisk
canter
as
much
as
we
did
we
disturbed
all
the
forest
life
as
we
galloped
along
hares
and
rabbits
scuttled
away
we
saw
their
white
tails
disappearing
into
holes
and
when
we
crossed
a
bit
of
plain
partridges
a
long
distance
off
would
rise
and
take
their
crooked
flight
across
the
fields
it
was
so
still
always
is
in
the
woods
that
the
horses
feet
could
be
heard
a
long
way
off
it
was
getting
colder
all
the
country
folk
predicted
a
very
cold
winter
and
the
looked
very
cheerful
and
comfortable
in
my
little
salon
when
we
came
in
however
everything
must
end
and
had
to
go
back
to
the
fight
which
promised
to
be
lively
in
paris
we
found
people
wearing
furs
and
preparing
for
a
cold
winter
the
house
of
the
quai
was
comfortable
well
warmed
calorifères
and
big
fires
in
all
the
rooms
and
whenever
there
was
any
sun
it
poured
into
the
rooms
from
the
garden
i
did
take
up
my
official
afternoon
receptions
the
session
had
not
begun
and
as
it
seemed
extremely
unlikely
that
the
coming
year
would
see
us
still
at
the
quai
it
was
not
worth
while
to
embark
upon
that
dreary
function
i
was
at
home
every
afternoon
after
five
had
tea
in
my
little
blue
salon
and
always
had
two
or
three
people
to
keep
me
company
prince
hohenlohe
came
often
settled
himself
in
an
armchair
with
his
cup
of
tea
and
talked
easily
and
charmingly
about
everything
he
was
just
back
from
germany
and
reported
bismarck
and
the
emperor
i
should
have
said
perhaps
the
emperor
and
bismarck
as
rather
worried
over
the
rapid
strides
france
was
making
in
radicalism
he
reassured
them
told
them
grévy
was
essentially
a
man
of
peace
and
as
long
as
moderate
men
like
léon
say
and
their
friends
remained
in
office
things
would
go
quietly
yes
if
they
remain
i
have
an
idea
we
stay
much
longer
and
report
says
freycinet
will
be
the
next
premier
he
evidently
had
heard
the
same
report
and
spoke
warmly
of
freycinet
intelligent
energetic
and
such
a
precise
mind
if
were
obliged
to
resign
which
he
personally
would
regret
he
thought
freycinet
was
the
coming
man
unless
gambetta
wanted
to
be
premier
he
did
think
he
did
was
not
quite
ready
yet
but
his
hand
might
be
forced
by
his
friends
and
of
course
if
he
wanted
it
he
would
be
the
next
président
du
conseil
he
also
told
me
a
great
many
things
that
blowitz
had
said
to
him
he
had
a
great
opinion
of
him
said
he
was
so
marvellously
of
all
that
was
going
on
it
was
curious
to
see
how
a
keen
clever
man
like
prince
hohenlohe
attached
so
much
importance
to
anything
that
blowitz
said
the
nuncio
monseigneur
czaski
came
too
sometimes
at
he
was
a
charming
talker
but
i
always
felt
as
if
he
were
saying
exactly
what
he
meant
to
and
what
he
wanted
me
to
repeat
to
i
am
never
quite
sure
with
italians
there
is
always
a
certain
reticence
under
their
extremely
natural
rather
exuberant
manner
monseigneur
czaski
was
not
an
italian
by
birth
a
pole
but
i
do
know
that
they
inspire
much
more
confidence
x
parliament
back
in
paris
the
question
of
the
return
of
the
parliament
to
paris
had
at
last
been
solved
after
endless
discussions
all
the
republicans
were
in
favour
of
it
and
they
were
masters
of
the
situation
the
president
grévy
too
wanted
it
very
much
if
the
chambers
continued
to
sit
at
versailles
he
would
be
obliged
to
establish
himself
there
which
he
did
want
to
do
many
people
were
very
unwilling
to
make
the
change
were
honestly
nervous
about
possible
disturbances
in
the
streets
and
though
they
grumbled
too
at
the
loss
of
time
the
draughty
carriages
of
the
parliamentary
train
they
still
preferred
those
discomforts
to
any
possibility
of
rioting
and
street
fights
and
the
invasion
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
by
a
paris
mob
was
very
anxious
for
the
change
he
did
in
the
least
anticipate
any
trouble
his
principal
reason
for
wanting
the
parliament
back
was
the
loss
of
time
and
also
to
get
rid
of
the
conversations
in
the
train
which
tired
him
very
much
he
never
could
make
himself
heard
without
an
effort
as
his
voice
was
low
had
no
timbre
and
he
did
hear
his
neighbours
very
well
in
the
noise
of
the
train
he
always
arrived
at
the
station
at
the
last
minute
and
got
into
the
last
carriage
hoping
to
be
undisturbed
and
have
a
quiet
with
his
papers
but
he
was
rarely
left
alone
if
any
deputy
who
wanted
anything
recognised
him
he
of
course
got
in
the
same
carriage
because
he
knew
he
was
sure
of
a
to
state
his
case
as
the
minister
could
get
away
from
him
the
chambers
met
after
a
short
vacation
in
november
at
last
in
paris
and
already
there
were
so
many
interpellations
announced
on
every
possible
subject
so
many
criticisms
on
the
policy
of
the
cabinet
and
so
many
people
wanting
other
people
places
that
the
session
promised
to
be
very
lively
the
senate
at
the
palais
du
luxembourg
the
deputies
at
the
palais
bourbon
and
i
went
over
to
the
luxembourg
one
morning
early
in
october
to
see
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
for
the
senate
he
wanted
too
to
choose
his
seat
i
had
been
there
in
the
daytime
for
years
i
had
dined
once
or
twice
at
the
petit
palais
with
various
presidents
of
the
senate
but
my
only
impression
was
a
very
long
drive
from
the
barrière
de
where
we
lived
and
fine
high
rooms
with
heavy
gilt
furniture
and
tapestries
the
palace
was
built
by
maria
de
medici
wife
of
henri
iv
after
the
death
of
that
very
chivalrous
but
very
undomestic
monarch
she
retired
to
the
luxembourg
and
from
there
as
regent
her
son
louis
xiii
was
only
ten
years
old
when
his
father
died
for
some
years
directed
the
policy
of
france
under
the
guidance
of
her
favourite
the
italian
concini
and
his
wife
the
palace
recalls
very
much
the
palazzo
pitti
in
florence
with
its
solid
masonry
and
rather
severe
heavy
architecture
it
must
have
been
a
gloomy
residence
notwithstanding
the
beautiful
gardens
with
their
broad
alleys
and
great
open
spaces
the
gardens
are
stiff
very
italian
with
statues
fountains
and
marble
balustrades
not
many
flowers
except
immediately
around
the
palace
but
they
were
flooded
with
sunshine
that
day
and
the
old
grey
pile
seemed
to
rise
out
of
a
parterre
of
bright
flowers
the
palace
has
been
slightly
modernised
but
the
general
architecture
remains
the
same
many
people
of
all
kinds
have
lived
there
since
it
was
built
several
royal
princes
and
the
emperor
napoleon
when
he
was
first
consul
he
went
from
there
to
the
tuileries
the
luxembourg
palace
has
always
been
associated
with
the
history
of
france
during
the
revolution
it
was
a
prison
and
many
of
the
curious
scenes
one
reads
of
at
that
period
took
place
in
those
old
walls
the
grandes
dames
so
careful
of
their
dress
and
their
manners
the
grands
seigneurs
so
brave
and
gallant
striving
in
every
way
by
their
witty
conversation
and
their
music
for
they
sang
and
played
in
the
prisons
all
through
that
awful
time
to
distract
the
women
and
make
them
forget
the
terrible
doom
that
was
hanging
over
them
many
people
went
straight
from
the
palace
to
the
scaffold
it
seemed
a
fitting
place
for
the
sittings
of
the
senate
and
the
deliberations
of
a
chosen
body
of
men
who
were
supposed
to
bring
a
maturer
judgment
and
a
wider
experience
in
the
discussion
of
all
the
burning
questions
of
the
day
than
the
ardent
young
deputies
so
eager
to
have
done
with
everything
connected
with
the
old
régime
and
start
fresh
after
we
had
inspected
the
palace
we
walked
about
the
gardens
which
were
charming
that
bright
october
morning
the
sun
really
too
strong
we
found
a
bench
in
the
shade
and
sat
there
very
happy
smoking
and
wondering
what
the
next
turn
of
the
wheel
would
bring
us
a
great
many
people
were
walking
about
and
sitting
under
the
trees
it
was
quite
a
different
public
from
what
one
saw
anywhere
else
many
students
of
both
sexes
carrying
books
small
easels
and
campstools
some
of
the
men
such
evident
bohemians
with
long
hair
sweeping
moustache
and
soft
felt
hat
quite
the
type
one
sees
in
the
pictures
or
plays
of
la
vie
de
bohême
their
girl
companions
looked
very
trim
and
neat
dressed
generally
in
black
their
clothes
fitting
extremely
well
most
of
them
bareheaded
but
some
had
hats
of
the
simplest
description
none
of
the
flaunting
feathers
and
bright
flowers
one
sees
on
the
boulevards
they
are
a
type
apart
the
modern
grisettes
so
quiet
and
as
to
be
almost
respectable
one
always
hears
that
the
quartier
latin
exist
any
more
the
students
are
more
serious
less
turbulent
and
that
the
hardworking
little
grisette
quite
content
with
her
simple
life
and
pleasure
has
degenerated
into
the
danseuse
of
the
and
barrière
theatres
i
do
think
so
a
certain
class
of
young
impecunious
students
will
always
live
in
that
quarter
and
will
always
amuse
themselves
and
they
will
also
always
find
girls
quite
ready
and
happy
to
enjoy
life
a
little
while
they
are
young
enough
to
live
in
the
present
and
have
no
cares
for
the
future
children
were
playing
about
in
the
alleys
and
broad
open
spaces
and
climbing
on
the
fountains
when
the
keepers
of
the
garden
were
not
anywhere
near
their
nurses
sitting
in
a
sunny
corner
with
their
work
it
was
quite
another
world
neither
the
nor
montmartre
all
looked
perfectly
respectable
and
the
couples
sitting
on
benches
in
most
affectionate
attitudes
were
too
much
taken
up
with
each
other
to
heed
the
i
went
back
there
several
times
afterward
taking
francis
with
me
and
it
was
curious
how
out
of
the
world
one
felt
paris
our
paris
might
have
been
miles
away
i
learned
to
know
some
of
the
habitués
quite
well
a
old
gentleman
who
always
brought
bread
for
the
birds
they
knew
him
perfectly
and
would
flutter
down
to
the
square
as
soon
as
he
appeared
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
tragic
face
always
alone
walking
up
and
down
muttering
and
talking
to
himself
he
may
have
been
an
aspirant
for
the
odéon
or
some
of
the
theatres
in
the
neighbourhood
a
lame
man
on
crutches
a
child
walking
beside
him
looking
wistfully
at
the
children
playing
about
but
not
daring
to
leave
her
charge
groups
of
students
hurrying
through
the
gardens
on
their
way
to
the
sorbonne
their
black
leather
serviettes
under
their
arms
couples
always
everywhere
i
do
think
there
were
many
foreigners
or
tourists
i
never
heard
anything
but
french
spoken
even
the
most
old
beggar
at
the
gate
who
sold
learned
to
know
us
and
would
run
to
open
the
door
of
the
carriage
with
the
contrariety
of
human
nature
some
people
would
say
of
feminine
nature
now
that
i
felt
i
was
not
going
to
live
much
longer
on
the
rive
gauche
i
was
getting
quite
fond
of
it
life
was
so
quiet
and
restful
in
those
long
narrow
streets
some
even
with
grass
growing
on
the
pavement
no
trams
no
omnibuses
very
little
passing
glimpses
occasionally
of
big
houses
standing
well
back
from
the
street
a
courtyard
in
front
and
garden
at
the
back
the
classic
faubourg
germain
hotel
entre
cour
et
jardin
i
went
to
tea
sometimes
with
a
friend
who
lived
in
a
big
house
in
the
rue
de
varenne
she
lived
on
the
fourth
floor
one
went
up
a
broad
bare
cold
stone
staircase
which
always
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
staircases
in
the
roman
palaces
her
rooms
were
large
very
high
ceilings
very
little
furniture
in
them
very
little
fire
in
winter
fine
old
family
portraits
on
the
walls
but
from
the
windows
one
looked
down
on
a
lovely
garden
where
the
sun
shone
and
the
birds
sang
all
day
it
was
just
like
being
in
the
country
so
extraordinarily
quiet
a
very
respectable
man
servant
in
an
brown
livery
with
a
great
many
brass
buttons
who
looked
as
old
as
the
house
itself
and
as
if
he
were
part
of
it
always
opened
the
door
her
husband
was
a
literary
man
who
made
conférences
at
the
sorbonne
and
the
collège
de
france
and
they
lived
entirely
in
that
quarter
came
very
rarely
to
our
part
of
paris
he
was
an
old
friend
of
and
they
came
sometimes
to
dine
with
us
he
deplored
having
gone
to
the
foreign
office
thought
the
public
instruction
was
so
much
more
to
his
tastes
and
habits
she
had
an
english
grandmother
knew
english
quite
well
and
read
english
reviews
and
papers
she
had
once
seen
queen
victoria
and
was
very
interested
in
all
that
concerned
her
queen
victoria
had
a
great
prestige
in
france
people
admired
not
only
the
wise
sovereign
who
had
weathered
successfully
so
many
changes
but
the
beautiful
woman
life
as
wife
and
mother
she
was
always
spoken
of
with
the
greatest
respect
even
by
people
who
were
not
sympathetic
to
england
as
a
nation
another
of
my
haunts
was
the
convent
and
maison
de
santé
of
the
soeurs
augustines
du
saint
coeur
de
marie
in
the
rue
de
la
santé
it
was
curious
to
turn
out
of
the
broad
busy
populous
avenue
crowded
with
trams
omnibuses
and
camions
into
the
narrow
quiet
street
which
seemed
all
stone
walls
and
big
doors
there
was
another
hospital
and
a
prison
in
the
street
which
naturally
gave
it
rather
a
gloomy
aspect
but
once
inside
the
courtyard
of
the
convent
there
was
a
complete
transformation
one
found
one
self
in
a
large
square
open
court
with
arcades
and
buildings
all
around
the
chapel
just
opposite
the
entrance
on
one
side
of
the
court
were
the
rooms
for
the
patients
on
the
other
nice
rooms
and
small
apartments
which
were
let
to
invalids
or
old
ladies
and
which
opened
on
a
garden
really
a
park
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
acres
the
doors
were
always
open
and
one
had
a
lovely
view
of
green
fields
and
trees
the
moment
you
put
your
foot
inside
the
court
you
felt
the
atmosphere
of
peace
and
cheerfulness
though
it
was
a
hospital
the
nuns
all
looked
happy
and
smiling
they
always
do
and
i
always
wonder
why
life
in
a
cloister
seems
to
me
so
narrow
and
monotonous
and
unsatisfying
unless
one
has
been
bred
in
a
convent
and
knows
nothing
of
life
but
what
the
teachers
tell
i
have
a
friend
who
always
fills
me
with
astonishment
a
very
clever
cultivated
woman
no
longer
very
young
married
to
a
charming
man
accustomed
to
life
in
its
largest
sense
she
was
utterly
wretched
when
her
husband
died
but
after
a
time
she
took
up
her
life
again
and
seemed
to
find
interest
and
pleasure
in
the
things
they
had
done
together
suddenly
she
announced
her
intention
of
becoming
a
nun
sold
her
house
and
lovely
garden
where
she
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
with
her
flowers
and
her
birds
distributed
her
pretty
things
among
her
friends
and
accepted
all
the
small
trials
of
strict
convent
life
no
bath
nor
mirror
coarse
underlinen
and
sheets
no
fire
no
lights
no
privacy
the
regular
irksome
routine
of
a
nun
life
and
is
perfectly
happy
never
misses
the
intellectual
companionship
and
the
refinement
and
daintiness
of
her
former
life
likes
the
commonplace
routine
of
the
convent
the
books
they
read
to
each
other
in
recreation
simple
stories
one
would
hardly
give
to
a
child
of
twelve
or
fourteen
the
fêtes
on
the
mother
birthday
when
the
nuns
make
a
cake
and
put
a
wreath
of
roses
on
the
mother
head
the
soeurs
augustines
are
very
happy
in
their
lives
but
they
see
a
great
deal
more
of
the
outside
world
they
always
have
patients
in
the
hospital
and
people
in
the
apartments
which
are
much
in
demand
the
care
and
attendance
is
very
good
the
ladies
are
very
comfortable
and
have
as
many
visitors
as
they
like
in
the
afternoon
at
stated
hours
and
the
rooms
are
very
tempting
with
white
walls
and
furniture
and
scrupulously
clean
the
cuisine
is
very
good
everything
very
daintily
served
all
day
one
saw
figures
moving
quietly
across
the
court
carrying
all
kinds
of
invalid
paraphernalia
cushions
rugs
cups
of
bouillon
but
there
was
never
any
noise
no
sound
of
talking
or
laughing
when
they
spoke
the
voices
were
low
like
people
accustomed
to
a
no
men
were
allowed
in
the
convent
except
the
doctors
of
course
and
visitors
at
stated
hours
i
spent
many
days
there
one
spring
as
was
there
for
some
weeks
for
a
slight
operation
she
had
a
charming
room
and
with
windows
giving
on
a
garden
or
rather
farmyard
for
the
soeurs
had
their
cows
and
chickens
sometimes
in
the
evening
we
would
see
one
of
the
sisters
her
black
skirt
tucked
up
and
a
blue
apron
over
it
bringing
the
cows
back
to
their
stables
no
man
could
have
a
room
in
the
house
wanted
very
much
to
be
with
his
wife
at
night
as
he
was
a
busy
man
and
away
all
day
and
i
tried
to
get
a
room
for
him
but
the
mother
superior
a
delightful
old
lady
would
hear
of
it
however
the
night
the
night
after
the
operation
he
was
allowed
to
remain
with
her
no
extra
bed
was
put
in
the
room
he
slept
on
the
sofa
often
when
was
sleeping
or
tired
i
would
take
my
book
and
establish
myself
in
the
garden
paris
might
have
been
miles
away
though
only
a
few
yards
off
there
was
a
busy
crowded
boulevard
but
no
noise
seemed
to
penetrate
the
thick
walls
occasionally
at
the
end
of
a
quiet
path
i
would
see
a
black
figure
pacing
backward
and
forward
with
eyes
fixed
on
a
breviary
once
or
twice
a
soeur
jardinière
with
a
big
flat
straw
hat
over
her
coiffe
and
veil
tending
the
flowers
there
were
not
many
or
weeding
the
lawn
sometimes
convalescents
or
old
ladies
seated
in
armchairs
under
the
trees
but
there
was
never
any
sound
of
voices
or
of
life
it
was
very
reposeful
when
one
felt
one
could
get
away
for
a
little
while
but
i
think
the
absolute
calm
and
monotony
would
pall
upon
one
and
the
call
of
the
world
the
struggling
living
joyous
world
outside
the
walls
would
be
an
irresistible
temptation
i
walked
about
a
good
deal
in
my
quarter
in
the
morning
and
made
acquaintance
with
many
funny
little
old
squares
and
shops
merceries
flower
and
toy
shops
which
had
not
yet
been
swallowed
up
by
the
enormous
establishments
like
the
louvre
the
bon
marché
and
the
big
bazaars
i
do
know
how
they
existed
there
was
never
any
one
in
the
shops
and
of
course
their
choice
was
limited
but
they
were
so
grateful
their
things
were
so
much
cheaper
and
they
were
so
anxious
to
get
anything
one
wanted
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
deal
with
them
everything
was
much
cheaper
on
that
side
flowers
cakes
rents
servants
wages
stable
equipment
horses
food
we
bought
some
toys
one
year
for
one
of
our
christmas
trees
in
the
country
from
a
poor
old
lame
woman
who
had
a
tiny
shop
in
one
of
the
small
streets
running
out
of
the
rue
du
bac
her
grandson
a
boy
of
about
twelve
or
fourteen
helped
her
in
the
shop
and
they
were
so
pleased
and
excited
at
having
such
a
large
order
that
they
were
quite
bewildered
we
did
get
what
we
wanted
but
it
took
time
and
patience
their
stock
was
small
and
not
varied
we
had
to
choose
piece
by
piece
horses
dolls
drums
and
the
writing
down
of
the
items
and
making
up
the
additions
was
long
and
trying
i
meant
to
go
back
after
we
left
the
quai
but
i
never
did
and
i
am
afraid
the
poor
old
woman
with
her
petit
commerce
shared
the
fate
of
all
the
others
and
could
not
hold
out
against
the
big
shops
one
gets
lazy
about
shopping
the
first
years
we
lived
in
the
country
we
used
to
go
ourselves
to
the
big
shops
and
bazaars
in
paris
for
our
christmas
shopping
but
the
heat
and
the
crowd
and
the
waiting
were
so
tiring
that
we
finally
made
arrangements
with
the
woman
who
sold
toys
in
the
little
town
la
she
went
to
paris
and
brought
back
specimens
of
all
the
new
toys
we
went
into
town
one
afternoon
all
the
toys
were
spread
out
on
tables
in
her
little
parlour
at
the
back
of
the
shop
her
little
girl
attending
to
the
customers
who
were
consumed
with
curiosity
as
to
why
our
carriage
was
waiting
so
long
at
the
door
and
we
made
our
selection
she
was
a
great
help
to
us
as
she
knew
all
the
children
their
ages
and
what
they
would
like
she
was
very
pleased
to
execute
the
commission
it
made
her
of
importance
in
the
town
having
the
big
boxes
come
down
from
paris
addressed
to
her
and
she
paid
her
journey
and
made
a
very
good
profit
by
charging
two
or
three
sous
more
on
each
article
we
were
quite
willing
to
pay
the
few
extra
francs
to
be
saved
the
fatigue
of
the
long
day
shopping
in
paris
it
also
settled
another
difficult
question
what
to
buy
in
a
small
country
town
once
we
had
exhausted
the
butcher
and
the
baker
and
the
small
groceries
there
was
not
much
to
buy
from
the
beginning
of
my
life
in
the
country
always
wanted
me
to
buy
as
much
as
possible
in
the
town
and
i
was
often
puzzled
now
the
shops
in
all
the
small
country
towns
have
improved
they
have
their
things
straight
from
paris
with
very
good
catalogues
so
that
one
can
order
fairly
well
the
things
are
more
expensive
of
course
but
i
think
it
is
right
to
give
what
help
one
can
to
the
people
of
the
country
one
cold
winter
at
bourneville
when
we
had
our
house
full
of
people
there
was
a
sudden
call
for
blankets
i
thought
my
lingerie
was
pretty
well
stocked
but
one
gentleman
wanted
four
blankets
on
his
bed
three
over
him
and
one
under
the
sheet
a
couple
wanted
the
same
only
one
more
a
blanket
for
a
big
armchair
near
the
fire
i
went
in
to
la
ferté
to
see
what
i
could
find
no
white
blankets
anywhere
some
rather
nice
red
ones
and
plenty
of
the
stiff
not
at
all
warm
grey
blankets
they
give
to
the
soldiers
those
naturally
were
out
of
the
question
but
i
took
three
or
four
red
ones
which
of
course
could
not
go
in
the
rooms
but
were
distributed
on
the
beds
of
the
family
their
white
ones
going
to
the
friends
after
that
experience
i
always
had
a
reserve
of
blankets
but
i
was
never
asked
for
so
many
again
living
in
the
country
with
people
constantly
staying
in
the
house
gives
one
much
insight
into
other
people
way
of
living
and
what
are
the
necessities
of
life
for
them
i
thought
our
house
was
pretty
well
provided
for
we
were
a
large
family
party
and
had
all
we
wanted
but
some
of
the
demands
were
curious
varying
of
course
with
the
nationalities
the
chambers
met
in
paris
at
the
end
of
november
and
took
possession
of
their
respective
houses
without
the
slightest
disturbance
of
any
kind
up
to
the
last
moment
some
people
were
nervous
and
predicting
all
sorts
of
trouble
and
complications
we
spent
the
toussaint
in
the
country
with
some
friends
and
their
views
of
the
future
were
so
gloomy
that
it
was
almost
contagious
one
afternoon
when
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
for
tea
after
a
beautiful
day
shooting
the
conversation
generally
retrospective
was
so
melancholy
that
i
was
rather
impressed
by
it
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
culpable
weakness
of
the
government
and
moderate
men
giving
way
entirely
to
the
radicals
an
invitation
to
the
paris
rabble
to
interfere
with
the
sittings
of
the
chambers
and
a
variety
of
similar
remarks
it
would
have
been
funny
if
one
had
felt
that
the
speakers
were
really
in
earnest
and
anxious
however
nothing
happened
the
first
few
days
there
was
a
small
perfectly
quiet
crowd
also
a
very
strong
police
force
at
the
palais
bourbon
but
i
think
more
from
curiosity
and
the
novelty
of
seeing
deputies
again
at
the
palais
bourbon
than
from
any
other
reason
if
it
were
quiet
outside
one
could
say
the
same
of
the
inside
of
the
chamber
the
fight
began
hotly
at
once
speeches
and
interpellations
and
attacks
on
the
government
were
the
order
of
the
day
the
different
members
of
the
cabinet
made
statements
explaining
their
policy
but
apparently
they
had
satisfied
nobody
on
either
side
and
it
was
evident
that
the
chamber
was
not
only
dissatisfied
but
actively
hostile
and
his
friends
were
very
discouraged
and
disgusted
they
had
gone
as
far
as
they
could
in
the
way
of
concessions
at
any
rate
would
do
no
more
and
it
was
evident
that
the
chamber
would
seize
the
first
pretext
to
overthrow
the
ministry
saw
grévy
very
often
he
was
opposed
to
any
change
did
want
to
go
said
his
presence
at
the
foreign
office
gave
confidence
to
europe
he
might
perhaps
remain
at
the
foreign
office
and
resign
as
premier
but
that
naturally
he
would
do
he
was
really
sick
of
the
whole
thing
grévy
was
a
thorough
republican
but
an
republican
not
in
the
least
enthusiastic
rather
sceptical
did
at
all
see
the
ideal
republic
dreamed
of
by
the
younger
men
where
all
men
were
alike
and
nothing
but
honesty
and
true
patriotism
were
the
ruling
motives
i
do
know
if
he
went
as
far
as
a
diplomatist
prince
metternich
i
think
who
said
he
was
so
tired
of
the
word
fraternité
that
if
he
had
a
brother
he
would
call
him
cousin
grévy
was
certainly
very
unwilling
to
see
things
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
more
advanced
left
i
do
think
he
could
have
done
anything
they
say
no
constitutional
president
or
king
either
can
there
was
a
great
rivalry
between
him
and
gambetta
both
men
had
such
a
strong
position
in
the
republican
party
that
it
was
a
pity
they
understand
each
other
i
suppose
they
were
too
unlike
gambetta
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
flattery
and
adulation
his
head
might
well
have
been
turned
all
his
familiars
were
at
his
feet
hanging
upon
his
words
putting
him
on
a
pinnacle
as
a
splendid
patriot
grévy
entourage
was
much
calmer
recognising
his
great
ability
and
his
keen
legal
mind
not
so
enthusiastic
but
always
wanting
to
have
his
opinion
and
relying
a
good
deal
upon
his
judgment
there
were
of
course
all
sorts
of
meetings
and
conversations
at
our
house
with
léon
say
jules
ferry
casimir
périer
and
others
vallier
came
on
from
berlin
where
he
was
still
ambassador
he
was
very
anxious
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
france
said
bismarck
was
very
worried
at
the
great
step
the
radicals
had
made
in
the
new
parliament
was
afraid
the
moderate
men
would
have
no
show
believe
he
was
pleased
and
hoped
that
a
succession
of
incapable
ministries
and
internal
quarrels
would
weaken
france
still
more
and
prevent
her
from
taking
her
place
again
as
a
great
power
he
was
a
generous
victor
as
long
as
was
at
the
foreign
office
things
went
very
smoothly
he
and
vallier
thought
alike
on
most
subjects
home
politics
and
foreign
and
since
the
berlin
congress
where
had
come
in
touch
with
all
the
principal
men
in
germany
it
was
of
course
much
easier
for
them
to
work
together
we
dined
generally
with
my
mother
on
sunday
night
particularly
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
the
official
banquets
had
not
begun
and
our
sundays
were
free
the
evenings
were
always
interesting
as
we
saw
so
many
people
english
and
americans
always
and
in
fact
all
nationalities
we
had
lived
abroad
so
much
that
we
knew
people
all
over
the
world
it
was
a
change
from
the
eternal
politics
and
shop
talk
we
heard
everywhere
else
some
of
them
english
particularly
i
do
think
the
americans
cared
much
about
foreign
politics
were
most
interested
and
curious
over
what
was
going
on
and
the
probable
fall
of
the
cabinet
an
english
lady
said
to
me
how
dreadful
it
will
be
for
you
when
your
husband
is
no
longer
minister
your
life
will
be
so
dull
and
you
will
be
of
so
much
less
importance
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
was
undoubtedly
true
any
wife
has
a
certain
importance
in
france
and
when
your
husband
has
been
foreign
minister
and
premier
you
fall
from
a
certain
height
but
i
could
accept
the
first
part
that
my
life
would
be
necessarily
dull
because
i
was
no
longer
what
one
of
my
friends
said
in
italy
speaking
of
a
minister
wife
a
donna
publica
i
began
to
explain
that
i
really
had
some
interest
in
life
outside
of
politics
but
she
was
so
convinced
of
the
truth
of
her
observation
that
it
was
quite
useless
to
pursue
the
conversation
and
i
naturally
did
care
another
one
an
american
this
time
said
to
me
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
never
having
been
to
see
you
since
you
were
married
but
i
never
could
remember
your
name
i
only
knew
it
began
with
and
one
sees
it
very
often
in
the
papers
arthur
sullivan
the
english
composer
was
there
one
night
he
had
come
over
to
paris
to
hear
one
of
his
symphonies
played
at
the
conservatoire
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
way
it
had
been
received
by
that
very
critical
audience
he
was
quite
surprised
to
find
the
parisians
so
enthusiastic
had
always
heard
the
paris
salle
was
so
cold
miss
kellogg
the
american
prima
donna
was
there
too
that
evening
and
we
made
a
great
deal
of
music
she
singing
and
sullivan
accompanying
by
heart
freeman
wife
of
one
of
the
english
secretaries
told
that
queen
victoria
had
so
enjoyed
her
talk
with
him
quite
as
if
i
were
talking
with
one
of
my
own
ministers
she
had
found
grévy
rather
stiff
and
reserved
said
their
conversation
was
absolutely
banal
they
spoke
in
french
and
as
grévy
knew
nothing
of
england
or
the
english
the
interview
could
have
been
interesting
we
saw
a
great
many
people
that
last
month
dined
with
all
our
colleagues
of
the
diplomatic
corps
they
were
already
dîners
as
every
day
in
the
papers
the
fall
of
the
ministry
was
announced
and
the
names
of
the
new
ministers
published
i
think
the
diplomatists
were
sorry
to
see
go
but
of
course
they
could
feel
very
strongly
on
the
subject
their
business
is
to
be
on
good
terms
with
all
the
foreign
ministers
and
to
get
as
much
as
they
can
out
of
them
they
are
with
rare
exceptions
birds
of
passage
and
do
trouble
themselves
much
about
changing
cabinets
however
they
were
all
very
civil
not
too
diffuse
and
one
had
the
impression
that
they
would
be
just
as
civil
to
our
successor
and
to
his
successor
it
must
be
so
there
is
no
profession
so
absolutely
banal
as
diplomacy
all
diplomatists
from
the
ambassador
to
the
youngest
secretary
must
follow
their
instructions
and
if
by
any
chance
an
ambassador
does
take
any
initiative
profiting
by
being
on
the
spot
and
knowing
the
character
of
the
people
he
is
promptly
disowned
by
his
chief
i
had
grown
very
philosophical
was
quite
ready
to
go
or
to
stay
mind
the
fight
any
more
nor
the
attacks
on
which
were
not
very
vicious
but
so
absurd
that
no
one
who
knew
him
could
attach
the
least
importance
to
them
he
did
care
a
pin
he
had
always
been
a
protestant
with
an
english
name
educated
in
england
so
the
reiteration
of
these
facts
very
much
exaggerated
and
leading
up
to
the
conclusion
that
on
account
of
his
birth
and
education
he
could
be
a
convinced
french
republican
did
affect
him
very
much
he
had
always
promised
me
a
winter
in
italy
when
he
left
office
he
had
never
been
in
rome
and
i
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
that
lovely
land
again
all
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
and
smiling
faces
we
dined
often
with
uncle
who
kept
us
au
courant
of
all
and
it
was
little
that
was
going
on
in
the
royalist
camp
but
that
was
not
of
importance
the
advanced
republicans
were
having
it
all
their
own
way
and
it
was
evident
that
the
days
of
conciliatory
measures
and
moderate
men
were
over
was
not
a
club
man
went
very
rarely
to
his
club
but
his
uncle
went
every
afternoon
before
dinner
and
gave
us
all
the
potins
gossip
of
that
world
very
hostile
to
the
republic
and
still
quite
believing
that
their
turn
would
come
his
uncle
was
not
of
that
opinion
he
was
a
very
clever
man
a
diplomatist
who
had
lived
in
a
great
many
places
and
known
a
great
many
people
and
was
entirely
on
the
royalist
side
but
he
thought
their
cause
was
a
lost
one
at
least
for
a
time
he
often
asked
some
of
his
friends
to
meet
us
at
dinner
said
it
was
a
good
thing
for
to
hear
what
men
on
the
other
side
thought
and
was
quite
pleased
to
meet
them
they
were
all
absolutely
opposed
to
him
in
politics
and
discussion
sometimes
ran
high
but
there
was
never
anything
personal
all
were
men
of
the
world
had
seen
many
changes
in
france
in
their
lives
many
had
played
a
part
in
politics
under
the
former
régimes
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
underrated
the
intelligence
and
the
strength
of
the
republican
party
one
of
the
regular
habitués
was
the
marquis
de
a
charming
man
fairly
given
the
atmosphere
he
lived
in
and
sceptical
to
the
highest
degree
he
was
a
great
friend
of
marshal
macmahon
and
had
been
préfet
at
pau
where
he
had
a
great
position
he
was
very
dictatorial
very
outspoken
but
was
a
great
favourite
particularly
with
the
english
colony
which
is
large
there
in
the
he
had
accepted
to
dine
one
night
with
an
english
family
who
lived
in
a
villa
a
little
out
of
town
they
had
an
accident
en
route
which
delayed
them
very
much
and
when
he
and
the
marquise
arrived
the
party
was
at
table
he
instantly
had
his
carriage
called
back
and
left
the
house
in
spite
of
all
the
explanations
and
apologies
of
his
host
saying
that
when
one
had
the
honour
of
receiving
the
marquis
de
one
waited
dinner
for
him
we
saw
always
a
great
deal
of
him
as
his
daughter
married
the
comte
de
who
was
for
some
time
in
cabinet
at
the
quai
and
afterward
with
us
the
ten
years
we
were
at
the
london
embassy
where
they
were
quite
part
of
the
family
they
were
both
perfectly
fitted
for
diplomatic
life
particularly
in
england
both
spoke
english
well
knew
everybody
and
remembered
all
the
faces
and
all
the
names
no
easy
thing
in
england
where
the
names
and
titles
change
so
often
i
know
several
englishwomen
who
have
had
four
different
names
lady
holland
was
also
a
friend
of
oncle
alphonse
and
dined
there
often
she
was
rather
quiet
in
general
conversation
though
she
spoke
french
easily
but
was
interesting
when
she
was
talking
to
one
or
two
people
we
went
often
to
her
beautiful
house
in
london
the
first
years
we
were
at
the
embassy
and
always
met
interesting
people
her
salon
was
very
cosmopolitan
every
one
who
came
to
london
wanted
to
go
to
holland
house
which
was
a
museum
filled
with
beautiful
things
another
lady
who
was
often
at
my
uncle
was
quite
a
different
type
mademoiselle
an
old
pupil
of
the
conservatoire
who
had
made
a
short
career
at
the
comédie
française
many
years
before
she
was
really
charming
and
her
stories
of
the
coulisses
and
the
jalousies
between
the
authors
and
the
actors
particularly
the
stars
who
hardly
accepted
the
slightest
observation
from
the
writer
of
the
play
were
most
amusing
once
the
piece
was
accepted
it
passed
into
the
domain
of
the
theatre
and
the
actors
felt
at
liberty
to
interpret
the
rôles
according
to
their
ideas
and
traditions
she
had
a
perfect
diction
it
was
a
delight
to
hear
her
she
recited
one
night
one
of
alphonse
daudet
little
contes
lettres
de
mon
moulin
i
think
beginning
qui
pas
vu
avignon
du
temps
des
papes
rien
vu
one
could
hear
anything
more
charming
in
a
perfectly
trained
voice
and
so
easily
and
naturally
said
i
suppose
no
one
would
listen
to
it
in
these
days
bridge
has
suppressed
all
conversation
or
music
or
artistic
enjoyment
of
any
kind
it
must
come
to
an
end
some
day
like
all
crazes
but
at
the
present
moment
it
has
destroyed
society
it
has
been
a
godsend
to
many
people
of
no
particular
importance
or
position
who
have
used
it
as
a
to
get
into
society
if
people
play
a
good
game
of
bridge
they
are
welcome
guests
in
a
great
many
houses
which
formerly
would
have
been
closed
to
them
and
it
is
a
great
resource
to
ladies
no
longer
very
young
widows
and
spinsters
who
find
their
days
long
and
do
know
what
to
do
with
their
lives
notwithstanding
his
preoccupations
managed
to
get
a
few
shooting
in
november
he
shot
several
times
at
rambouillet
with
grévy
who
was
an
excellent
shot
and
his
shooting
breakfasts
were
very
pleasant
there
was
plenty
of
game
everything
very
well
organised
and
the
company
agreeable
he
always
asked
the
ministers
ambassadors
and
many
of
the
leading
political
men
and
very
often
some
of
his
old
friends
lawyers
and
men
of
various
professions
whom
was
delighted
to
meet
their
ideas
did
run
in
grooves
like
most
of
the
men
he
lived
with
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
talk
that
was
political
nor
personal
the
vicious
attacks
upon
persons
were
so
trying
those
first
days
of
the
republic
every
man
who
was
a
little
more
prominent
than
his
neighbour
seemed
a
target
for
every
kind
of
insinuation
and
criticism
we
went
for
two
days
to
pout
casimir
périer
fine
place
in
the
département
de
where
we
had
capital
shooting
it
was
already
extremely
cold
for
the
season
the
big
pond
in
the
court
was
frozen
hard
and
the
wind
whistled
about
our
ears
when
we
drove
in
an
open
carriage
to
join
the
shooters
at
breakfast
even
i
who
do
usually
feel
the
cold
was
thankful
to
be
well
wrapped
up
in
furs
the
pavillon
looked
very
inviting
as
we
drove
up
an
immense
fire
was
blazing
in
the
chimney
another
just
outside
where
the
soup
and
ragout
for
the
army
of
beaters
were
being
prepared
we
all
had
nice
little
under
our
chairs
and
were
as
comfortable
as
possible
it
was
too
warm
in
fact
when
the
shooters
came
in
and
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
we
were
obliged
to
open
the
door
the
talk
was
entirely
shop
at
breakfast
every
man
telling
what
he
had
killed
or
missed
and
the
minute
they
had
finished
breakfast
they
started
off
again
we
followed
one
or
two
battues
pheasants
but
it
was
really
too
cold
and
we
were
glad
to
walk
home
to
get
warm
the
dinner
and
evening
were
pleasant
everybody
talking
most
of
them
criticising
the
government
freely
did
mind
they
were
all
friends
he
defended
himself
sometimes
merely
asking
what
they
would
have
done
in
his
place
he
was
quite
ready
to
receive
any
suggestions
but
nothing
practical
ever
came
out
of
the
discussions
i
think
the
most
delightful
political
position
in
the
world
must
be
leader
of
the
opposition
you
have
no
responsibilities
can
concentrate
all
your
energies
in
pointing
out
the
weak
spots
in
your
adversary
armour
and
have
always
your
work
cut
out
for
you
for
as
soon
as
one
ministry
falls
you
can
set
to
work
to
demolish
its
successor
which
seems
the
most
interesting
occupation
possible
the
great
question
which
was
disturbing
the
chambers
and
the
country
was
the
general
amnesty
that
of
course
would
never
agree
to
there
might
be
exceptions
some
of
the
men
who
took
part
in
the
commune
were
so
young
little
more
than
lads
carried
away
by
the
example
of
their
elders
and
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
there
were
fiery
patriotic
articles
in
almost
all
the
republican
papers
inviting
france
to
make
the
beau
geste
of
la
mère
patrie
and
open
her
arms
to
her
misguided
children
and
various
sensible
experienced
men
really
thought
it
would
be
better
to
wipe
out
everything
and
start
again
with
no
dark
memories
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
beginnings
of
the
young
republic
how
many
brilliant
sanguine
impossible
theories
i
heard
advanced
all
those
days
and
how
the
few
remaining
members
of
the
centre
gauche
tried
to
reason
with
the
most
liberal
men
of
the
centre
droit
and
to
persuade
them
frankly
to
face
the
fact
that
the
country
had
sent
a
strong
republican
majority
to
parliament
and
to
make
the
best
of
the
fait
accompli
i
suppose
it
was
asking
too
much
of
them
to
go
back
on
the
traditions
of
their
lives
but
after
all
they
were
frenchmen
their
country
was
just
recovering
from
a
terrible
disaster
and
had
need
of
all
her
children
during
the
war
all
party
feeling
was
forgotten
every
man
was
first
a
frenchman
in
the
face
of
a
foreign
foe
and
if
they
could
have
stood
firmly
together
in
those
first
days
after
the
war
the
strength
of
the
country
would
have
been
wonderful
all
europe
was
astounded
at
the
way
in
which
france
paid
her
milliards
no
one
more
so
than
bismarck
who
is
supposed
to
have
said
that
if
he
could
have
dreamed
that
france
could
pay
that
enormous
sum
so
quickly
he
would
have
asked
much
more
december
was
very
cold
snow
and
ice
everywhere
and
very
hard
frosts
which
did
give
way
at
all
when
the
sun
came
out
occasionally
in
the
middle
of
the
day
everybody
was
skating
not
only
at
the
clubs
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
but
on
the
lakes
which
happens
very
rarely
as
the
water
is
fairly
deep
the
seine
was
full
of
large
blocks
of
ice
which
got
jammed
up
against
the
bridges
and
made
a
jarring
ugly
sound
as
they
knocked
against
each
other
the
river
steamers
had
stopped
running
and
there
were
crowds
of
flaneurs
loitering
on
the
quais
and
bridges
wondering
if
the
cold
would
last
long
enough
for
the
river
to
be
quite
frozen
over
and
i
went
two
or
three
times
to
the
cercle
des
patineurs
at
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
had
a
good
skate
the
women
did
skate
as
well
then
as
they
do
now
but
they
looked
very
pretty
in
their
costumes
of
velvet
and
sables
it
was
funny
to
see
them
stumbling
over
the
ice
with
a
man
supporting
them
on
each
side
however
they
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
was
beautiful
winter
weather
very
cold
but
no
wind
and
it
was
very
good
exercise
all
the
world
was
there
and
the
afternoons
passed
quickly
enough
i
had
not
skated
for
years
having
spent
all
my
winters
in
italy
but
on
the
principle
that
you
never
forget
anything
that
you
know
well
i
thought
i
would
try
and
will
say
that
the
first
was
absolute
suffering
it
was
in
the
old
days
when
one
still
wore
a
strap
over
the
instep
which
naturally
was
drawn
very
tight
my
feet
were
like
lumps
of
ice
as
heavy
as
lead
and
i
did
seem
able
to
lift
them
from
the
ground
i
went
back
to
the
to
take
my
skates
off
for
a
few
minutes
and
when
the
blood
began
to
circulate
again
i
could
have
cried
with
the
pain
a
friend
of
mine
a
beginner
who
was
sitting
near
waiting
to
have
her
skates
put
on
was
rather
discouraged
and
said
to
me
you
do
look
as
if
you
were
enjoying
yourself
i
do
think
i
will
try
oh
yes
you
must
commencements
sont
toujours
difficiles
and
you
will
learn
i
shall
be
all
right
as
soon
as
i
start
again
she
looked
rather
doubtful
but
i
saw
her
again
later
in
the
day
when
i
had
forgotten
all
about
my
sufferings
and
she
was
skating
as
easily
as
i
did
when
i
was
a
girl
i
think
one
must
learn
young
after
all
it
is
more
or
less
a
question
of
balance
when
one
is
young
one
does
mind
a
fall
who
had
retired
to
a
corner
to
practise
a
little
by
himself
told
me
that
one
of
his
friends
comte
de
pourtalès
not
at
all
of
his
way
of
thinking
in
politics
an
imperialist
was
much
pleased
with
a
little
jeu
he
had
made
at
his
expense
caught
the
top
of
his
skate
in
a
crevice
in
the
ice
and
came
down
rather
heavily
in
a
sitting
posture
comte
de
pourtalès
who
was
standing
near
on
the
bank
saw
the
fall
and
called
out
instantly
possible
que
je
voie
le
président
du
conseil
par
terre
is
it
possible
that
the
president
du
conseil
has
fallen
the
little
joke
was
quite
de
bonne
guerre
and
quite
appropriate
as
the
cabinet
was
tottering
and
very
near
its
fall
it
amused
quite
as
much
as
it
did
the
bystanders
the
cold
was
increasing
every
day
the
ground
was
frozen
hard
the
streets
very
slippery
and
going
very
difficult
all
our
horses
were
rough
shod
but
even
with
that
we
made
very
slow
progress
some
of
the
omnibuses
were
on
runners
and
one
or
two
of
the
young
men
of
the
ministry
had
taken
off
the
wheels
of
their
light
carriages
and
put
them
on
runners
but
one
did
see
many
real
sleighs
or
sledges
as
they
call
them
here
i
fancy
sleigh
is
entirely
an
american
expression
the
seine
was
at
last
completely
taken
and
the
public
was
allowed
on
the
ice
which
was
very
thick
it
was
a
very
pretty
animated
sight
many
booths
like
those
one
sees
on
the
boulevard
during
the
christmas
holidays
were
installed
on
the
ice
close
to
the
banks
and
the
river
was
black
with
people
they
could
skate
much
as
the
ice
was
rough
and
there
were
too
many
people
but
they
ran
and
slid
and
shouted
and
enjoyed
themselves
immensely
i
wanted
to
cross
one
day
with
my
boy
that
he
might
say
he
had
crossed
the
seine
on
foot
but
was
rather
unwilling
however
the
préfet
de
la
seine
whom
he
consulted
told
him
there
was
absolutely
no
danger
the
ice
was
several
inches
thick
so
i
started
off
one
afternoon
one
of
the
secretaries
going
with
me
he
was
much
astonished
and
rather
nervous
at
seeing
me
in
my
ordinary
boots
he
had
nails
in
his
and
one
of
our
friends
whom
we
met
on
the
ice
had
woollen
socks
over
his
boots
they
were
sure
i
would
slip
and
perhaps
get
a
bad
fall
but
no
one
could
slip
on
that
ice
it
is
quite
rough
might
almost
be
a
ploughed
field
but
they
were
uncomfortable
and
were
very
pleased
when
i
landed
safely
on
the
other
side
and
got
into
the
carriage
just
in
the
middle
the
boys
had
swept
a
path
on
the
ice
to
make
a
glissade
they
were
racing
up
and
down
in
bands
and
the
constant
passing
had
made
it
quite
level
and
very
slippery
we
saw
three
or
four
unwary
pedestrians
get
a
fall
but
if
one
kept
on
the
outside
near
the
bank
there
was
no
danger
of
slipping
the
extreme
cold
lasting
so
long
brought
many
discomforts
many
trains
with
wood
and
provisions
could
get
to
paris
the
railroads
were
all
blocked
and
the
parisians
were
getting
uneasy
fearing
they
might
run
short
of
food
and
fuel
we
were
very
comfortable
in
the
big
rooms
of
the
ministry
there
were
roaring
fires
everywhere
and
two
or
three
calorifères
the
view
from
the
windows
on
the
quai
was
charming
as
long
as
the
great
cold
lasted
particularly
at
night
when
the
river
was
alive
with
people
lights
and
coloured
lanterns
and
music
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
ronde
or
a
farandole
the
farandole
forcing
its
way
through
the
crowd
every
one
carrying
a
lantern
and
looking
like
a
brilliant
snake
winding
in
and
out
we
had
some
people
dining
one
night
and
they
could
keep
away
from
the
windows
some
of
the
young
ones
english
wanted
to
go
down
and
have
a
lark
on
the
ice
but
it
was
possible
the
crowd
though
thoroughly
merely
bent
on
enjoying
themselves
had
degenerated
into
a
rabble
one
would
have
been
obliged
to
have
a
strong
escort
of
police
and
besides
in
evening
dress
even
with
fur
cloaks
and
the
fur
and
woollen
boots
every
one
wore
over
their
thin
shoes
one
would
certainly
have
risked
getting
a
bad
attack
of
pneumonia
one
of
our
great
friends
sir
henry
hoare
was
dining
that
night
but
he
did
want
to
go
down
preferred
smoking
his
cigar
in
a
warm
room
and
talking
politics
to
he
had
been
a
great
deal
in
paris
knew
everybody
and
was
a
member
of
the
jockey
club
he
was
much
interested
in
french
politics
and
au
fond
was
very
liberal
quite
sympathised
with
and
his
friends
and
shared
their
opinions
on
most
subjects
though
as
he
said
i
do
air
those
opinions
at
the
jockey
club
he
came
often
to
our
big
receptions
liked
to
see
all
the
people
he
too
used
to
tell
me
all
that
was
said
in
his
club
about
the
republic
and
the
government
but
he
was
a
shrewd
observer
had
been
a
long
time
an
in
england
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
talk
at
the
clubs
was
chiefly
a
pose
they
really
have
many
illusions
about
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
could
have
when
even
the
duc
de
broglie
with
his
intelligence
and
following
the
faubourg
germain
followed
him
blindly
could
do
nothing
but
make
a
constitutional
republic
with
marshal
macmahon
at
its
head
it
was
always
said
too
that
the
women
were
more
uncompromising
than
the
men
i
went
one
afternoon
to
a
concert
at
the
austrian
embassy
given
in
aid
of
some
inundations
which
had
been
a
catastrophe
for
that
country
hundreds
of
houses
and
people
and
cattle
swept
away
the
french
public
had
responded
most
generously
as
they
always
do
to
the
urgent
appeal
made
by
the
ambassador
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
and
the
government
had
contributed
largely
to
the
fund
count
beust
the
austrian
ambassador
was
obliged
of
course
to
invite
the
government
and
madame
grévy
to
the
entertainment
as
well
as
his
friends
of
the
faubourg
germain
neither
madame
nor
mademoiselle
grévy
came
but
some
of
the
wives
did
and
it
was
funny
to
see
the
ladies
of
society
looking
at
the
republican
ladies
as
if
they
were
denizens
of
a
different
planet
strange
figures
they
were
not
accustomed
to
see
it
is
curious
to
think
of
all
that
now
when
relations
are
much
less
strained
i
remember
not
very
long
ago
at
a
party
at
one
of
the
embassies
seeing
many
of
the
society
women
having
themselves
presented
to
the
wife
of
the
then
minister
of
foreign
affairs
with
whom
they
certainly
had
nothing
in
common
neither
birth
breeding
nor
mode
of
life
i
was
talking
to
casimir
périer
late
president
of
the
republic
and
it
amused
us
very
much
to
see
the
various
introductions
and
the
great
empressement
of
the
ladies
all
of
whom
were
asking
to
be
presented
to
madame
what
can
all
those
women
want
i
asked
him
he
replied
promptly
embassies
for
their
husbands
it
would
have
been
better
i
think
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
if
more
embassies
had
been
given
to
the
bearers
of
some
of
the
great
names
of
france
but
there
were
so
many
candidates
for
every
description
of
function
in
france
just
then
from
an
ambassador
to
a
gendarme
that
anybody
who
had
anything
to
give
found
himself
in
a
difficult
position
xi
last
days
at
the
foreign
office
the
end
of
december
was
detestable
we
were
en
pleine
crise
for
ten
days
every
day
went
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
expecting
to
be
beaten
and
every
evening
came
home
discouraged
and
disgusted
the
chamber
was
making
the
position
of
the
ministers
perfectly
untenable
all
sorts
of
violent
and
useless
propositions
were
discussed
and
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
jealousy
and
intrigue
everywhere
one
day
just
before
christmas
about
the
and
his
chef
de
cabinet
comte
de
started
for
the
house
after
breakfast
expecting
to
be
beaten
by
a
coalition
vote
of
the
extreme
left
bonapartists
and
legitimists
it
was
an
insane
policy
on
the
part
of
the
two
last
as
they
knew
perfectly
well
they
would
gain
anything
by
upsetting
the
actual
cabinet
they
would
only
get
another
one
much
more
advanced
and
more
masterful
i
suppose
their
idea
was
to
have
a
succession
of
radical
inefficient
ministers
which
in
the
end
would
disgust
the
country
and
make
a
saviour
a
prince
which
one
or
general
possible
how
wise
their
reasoning
was
time
has
shown
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
chamber
to
hear
the
debate
but
did
want
me
he
would
be
obliged
to
speak
and
said
it
would
worry
him
if
i
were
in
the
gallery
listening
to
all
the
attacks
made
upon
him
it
is
rather
curious
that
i
never
heard
him
speak
in
public
either
in
the
house
or
in
the
country
where
he
often
made
political
speeches
in
election
times
he
was
so
sure
that
the
ministry
would
fall
that
we
had
already
begun
cleaning
and
making
fires
in
our
own
house
so
on
that
afternoon
as
i
did
want
to
sit
at
home
waiting
for
telegrams
i
went
up
to
the
house
with
henrietta
the
caretaker
had
already
told
us
that
the
stock
of
wood
and
coal
was
giving
out
and
she
could
get
any
more
in
the
quarter
and
if
she
make
fires
the
pipes
would
burst
which
was
a
pleasant
prospect
with
the
thermometer
at
i
do
remember
how
many
degrees
below
zero
we
found
a
fine
cleaning
going
on
doors
and
windows
open
all
over
the
house
and
women
scrubbing
stairs
floors
and
windows
rather
under
difficulties
with
little
fire
and
little
water
it
looked
perfectly
dreary
and
comfortless
not
at
all
tempting
all
the
furniture
was
piled
up
in
the
middle
of
the
rooms
and
library
was
a
curiosity
books
and
pamphlets
accumulated
rapidly
with
us
was
a
member
of
many
literary
societies
of
all
kinds
all
over
the
world
and
packages
and
boxes
of
unopened
books
quite
choked
up
the
room
and
i
tried
to
arrange
things
a
little
but
it
was
hopeless
that
day
and
besides
the
house
was
bitterly
cold
it
did
feel
as
if
a
fire
could
make
any
impression
as
we
could
do
nothing
there
we
went
back
to
the
ministry
no
telegrams
had
come
but
kruft
our
faithful
and
efficient
chef
du
matériel
was
waiting
for
me
for
last
instructions
about
a
christmas
tree
some
days
before
i
had
decided
to
have
a
christmas
tree
about
the
end
of
the
month
then
thought
the
ministry
would
last
over
the
holidays
the
trêve
des
confiseurs
and
was
quite
willing
i
should
have
a
christmas
party
as
a
last
entertainment
he
had
been
too
occupied
the
last
days
to
think
about
any
such
trifles
and
kruft
not
having
had
any
contrary
instructions
had
ordered
the
presents
and
decorations
he
was
rather
depressed
because
had
told
him
that
morning
that
we
surely
would
not
be
at
the
quai
on
the
the
day
we
had
chosen
for
our
party
however
i
reassured
him
and
told
him
we
would
have
the
christmas
tree
all
the
same
only
at
my
house
instead
of
at
the
ministry
we
went
to
look
at
his
presents
which
were
all
spread
out
on
a
big
table
in
one
of
the
he
really
was
a
wonderful
man
never
forgot
anything
and
had
remembered
that
at
the
last
tree
the
year
before
one
or
two
nurses
had
had
no
presents
and
several
who
had
were
not
pleased
with
what
was
given
to
them
he
had
made
a
very
good
selection
for
those
ladies
lace
scarfs
and
rabats
and
little
tours
de
cou
of
fur
really
very
pretty
i
believe
they
were
satisfied
this
time
the
young
men
of
the
chancery
sent
me
up
two
telegrams
rien
de
nouveau
ministère
debout
illustration
de
freyeinet
after
a
photograph
by
nadaz
paris
came
home
late
very
tired
and
much
disgusted
with
politics
in
general
and
his
party
in
particular
the
cabinet
still
lived
but
merely
to
give
grévy
time
to
make
another
had
been
to
the
elysée
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
grévy
he
found
him
very
preoccupied
very
unwilling
to
make
a
change
and
he
again
urged
very
much
to
keep
the
foreign
office
if
freycinet
should
succeed
in
making
a
ministry
that
would
not
agree
to
he
was
sick
of
the
whole
thing
he
told
grévy
he
was
quite
right
to
send
for
freycinet
if
any
man
could
save
the
situation
he
could
we
had
one
or
two
friends
political
men
to
dinner
and
they
discussed
the
situation
from
every
point
of
view
always
ending
with
the
same
conclusion
that
was
right
to
go
his
policy
was
the
policy
of
the
chamber
i
do
say
of
the
country
for
i
think
the
country
knew
little
and
cared
less
about
what
was
going
on
in
parliament
hardly
the
policy
of
all
his
own
colleagues
there
was
really
no
use
to
continue
worrying
himself
to
death
and
doing
no
good
said
his
conversation
with
grévy
was
interesting
but
he
was
much
more
concerned
with
home
politics
and
the
sweeping
changes
the
republicans
wanted
to
make
in
all
the
administrations
than
with
foreign
policy
he
said
europe
was
quiet
and
france
first
duty
was
to
establish
herself
firmly
which
would
only
be
done
by
peace
and
prosperity
at
home
i
told
i
had
spent
a
very
cold
and
uncomfortable
hour
at
the
house
and
i
was
worried
about
the
cold
thought
i
might
perhaps
send
the
boy
to
mother
but
he
had
taken
his
precautions
and
arranged
with
the
minister
of
war
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
wood
delivered
at
the
house
they
always
had
reserves
of
wood
at
the
various
ministries
we
had
ours
directly
from
our
own
woods
in
the
country
and
it
was
en
route
but
a
flotilla
of
boats
was
frozen
up
in
the
canal
de
and
it
might
be
weeks
before
the
wood
could
be
delivered
we
dined
one
night
at
the
british
embassy
while
all
these
pourparlers
were
going
on
en
petit
comité
all
english
lord
and
lady
reay
lord
edmond
and
one
or
two
members
of
parliament
whose
names
i
have
forgotten
both
lord
and
lady
reay
were
very
keen
about
politics
knew
france
well
and
were
much
interested
in
the
phase
she
was
passing
through
lord
lyons
was
charming
so
friendly
and
sensible
said
he
was
surprised
at
wanting
to
go
still
hoped
this
crisis
would
pass
like
so
many
others
he
had
seen
in
france
that
certainly
presence
at
the
foreign
office
during
the
last
year
had
been
a
help
to
the
republic
said
also
he
did
believe
his
retirement
would
last
very
long
it
was
frightfully
cold
when
we
came
out
of
the
embassy
very
few
carriages
out
all
the
coachmen
wrapped
up
in
mufflers
and
fur
caps
and
the
place
de
la
concorde
a
sea
of
ice
so
slippery
i
thought
we
should
never
get
across
and
over
the
bridge
i
went
to
the
opera
one
night
that
week
got
there
in
an
when
people
were
walking
about
and
reading
the
papers
as
i
passed
several
groups
of
men
i
heard
name
mentioned
also
that
of
léon
say
and
freycinet
but
just
in
passing
by
quickly
i
could
not
hear
any
comments
i
fancy
they
were
not
favourable
in
that
milieu
it
was
very
cold
in
the
house
almost
all
the
women
had
their
cloaks
on
and
the
coming
out
was
something
awful
crossing
that
broad
perron
in
the
face
of
a
biting
wind
i
began
my
packing
seriously
this
time
as
mind
was
quite
made
up
he
had
thought
the
matter
well
over
and
had
a
final
talk
with
freycinet
who
would
have
liked
to
keep
both
and
léon
say
but
it
was
easy
to
manage
the
new
element
that
freycinet
brought
with
him
the
new
members
were
much
more
advanced
in
their
opinions
have
worked
with
them
and
they
certainly
did
want
to
work
with
him
the
autumn
session
came
to
a
turbulent
end
on
the
of
december
and
the
next
day
the
papers
announced
that
the
ministers
had
given
their
resignations
to
the
president
who
had
accepted
them
and
had
charged
de
freycinet
to
form
a
cabinet
we
dined
with
mother
on
christmas
day
a
family
party
with
the
addition
of
comte
de
and
one
or
two
stray
americans
who
were
at
hotels
and
were
of
course
delighted
not
to
dine
on
christmas
day
at
a
table
or
café
was
rather
tired
the
constant
talking
and
seeing
so
many
people
of
all
kinds
was
very
fatiguing
for
as
long
as
his
resignation
was
not
official
announced
in
the
he
was
still
minister
of
foreign
affairs
one
of
the
last
days
when
they
were
hoping
to
come
to
an
agreement
he
was
obliged
to
come
home
early
to
receive
the
mission
from
morocco
i
saw
them
arrive
they
were
a
fine
set
of
men
tall
powerfully
built
their
skin
a
not
black
entirely
dressed
in
white
from
turbans
to
sandals
none
of
them
spoke
any
french
all
the
conversation
took
place
through
an
interpreter
notwithstanding
our
worries
we
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
and
was
very
cheerful
looking
forward
to
our
italian
trip
with
quite
as
much
pleasure
as
i
did
made
over
the
ministry
to
freycinet
on
monday
the
the
transmission
des
pouvoirs
freycinet
was
very
nice
and
friendly
regretted
that
he
and
were
no
longer
colleagues
he
thought
his
ministry
was
strong
and
was
confident
he
would
manage
the
chamber
told
him
he
could
settle
himself
as
soon
as
he
liked
at
the
quai
as
we
should
go
at
once
and
would
sleep
at
our
house
on
wednesday
night
freycinet
said
madame
de
freycinet
whom
i
knew
well
and
liked
very
much
would
come
and
see
me
on
wednesday
and
would
like
to
go
over
the
house
with
me
i
was
rather
taken
aback
when
told
me
we
must
sleep
in
our
own
house
on
wednesday
night
the
actual
packing
was
not
very
troublesome
as
i
had
not
brought
many
of
my
own
things
from
the
rue
dumont
there
was
scarcely
a
of
small
furniture
and
boxes
but
the
getting
together
of
all
the
small
things
was
a
bore
books
bibelots
music
cards
and
notes
these
in
quantities
lettres
de
condoléance
which
had
to
be
carefully
sorted
as
they
had
all
to
be
answered
the
hotel
of
the
quai
was
crowded
with
people
those
last
two
days
all
friends
coming
to
express
their
regrets
at
his
departure
some
very
sincerely
sorry
to
see
him
go
as
his
name
and
character
certainly
inspired
confidence
abroad
and
some
delighted
that
he
was
no
longer
a
member
of
such
an
advanced
cabinet
some
said
de
cet
infect
gouvernement
where
he
was
obliged
by
his
mere
presence
to
sanction
many
things
he
did
approve
of
he
and
freycinet
had
a
long
talk
on
wednesday
as
naturally
wanted
to
be
sure
that
some
provision
would
be
made
for
his
chef
de
cabinet
and
secretaries
each
incoming
minister
brings
his
own
staff
with
him
freycinet
offered
the
london
embassy
but
he
would
take
it
had
had
enough
of
public
life
for
the
present
i
did
want
it
either
i
had
never
lived
much
in
england
had
not
many
friends
there
and
was
counting
the
days
until
we
could
get
off
to
rome
there
was
one
funny
result
of
having
declined
the
london
embassy
admiral
pothnau
whom
had
named
there
and
who
was
very
much
liked
came
to
see
him
one
day
and
made
a
great
scene
because
freycinet
had
offered
him
the
london
embassy
said
he
did
understand
why
he
made
a
scene
as
he
had
refused
it
but
it
should
never
have
been
offered
to
you
over
my
head
perhaps
but
that
is
not
my
fault
i
did
ask
for
it
and
do
want
it
if
you
think
you
have
been
treated
badly
you
should
speak
to
freycinet
however
the
admiral
was
very
much
put
out
and
was
very
cool
with
us
both
for
a
long
time
i
suppose
his
idea
was
that
being
recalled
would
mean
that
he
had
not
done
well
in
london
which
was
quite
a
mistake
as
he
was
very
much
liked
there
we
dined
alone
that
last
night
at
the
ministry
and
sat
some
time
in
the
window
looking
at
the
crowds
of
people
amusing
themselves
on
the
seine
and
wondering
if
we
should
ever
see
the
quai
again
after
all
we
had
had
two
very
happy
interesting
years
there
and
memories
that
would
last
a
some
of
the
last
experiences
of
the
month
of
december
had
been
rather
disillusioning
but
i
suppose
one
must
not
bring
any
sentiment
into
politics
in
the
world
it
is
always
a
case
of
donnant
donnant
and
when
one
is
no
longer
in
a
position
to
give
a
great
deal
people
naturally
turn
to
the
rising
man
comte
de
chef
de
cabinet
came
in
late
as
usual
to
have
a
last
talk
he
too
had
been
busy
as
he
had
a
small
apartment
and
stables
in
the
hotel
of
the
ministry
and
was
also
very
anxious
to
get
away
he
told
us
all
the
young
men
of
the
cabinet
were
very
sorry
to
see
go
at
first
they
had
found
him
a
little
cold
and
reserved
but
a
two
years
experience
had
shown
them
that
if
he
were
not
expansive
he
was
perfectly
just
and
always
did
what
he
said
he
would
the
next
day
madame
de
freycinet
came
to
see
me
and
we
went
over
the
house
she
did
care
about
the
as
they
never
lived
at
the
quai
remained
in
their
own
hotel
near
the
bois
de
boulogne
freycinet
came
every
day
to
the
ministry
and
she
merely
on
reception
days
or
when
there
was
a
party
just
as
she
was
going
madame
de
zuylen
wife
of
the
dutch
minister
a
great
friend
of
mine
came
in
she
told
me
she
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
up
as
i
had
forbidden
my
door
but
my
faithful
gérard
i
think
i
missed
him
as
much
as
anything
else
at
first
knowing
we
were
friends
thought
madame
would
like
to
see
her
she
paid
me
quite
a
long
visit
i
even
gave
her
some
tea
off
government
plate
and
china
all
mine
had
been
already
sent
to
my
own
house
we
sat
talking
for
some
time
she
had
heard
that
had
refused
the
london
embassy
was
afraid
it
was
a
mistake
and
that
the
winter
in
paris
would
be
a
difficult
one
for
him
he
would
certainly
be
in
opposition
to
the
government
on
all
sorts
of
questions
and
if
he
remained
in
paris
he
would
naturally
go
to
the
senate
and
vote
i
quite
agreed
that
he
could
suddenly
detach
himself
from
all
political
discussions
must
take
part
in
them
and
must
vote
the
policy
of
abstention
has
always
seemed
to
me
the
weakest
possible
line
in
politics
if
a
man
for
some
reason
or
another
has
the
courage
of
his
opinions
he
must
take
any
position
where
that
opinion
would
carry
weight
i
told
her
we
were
going
to
italy
as
soon
as
we
could
get
off
after
the
holidays
while
we
were
talking
a
message
came
up
to
say
that
the
young
men
of
the
cabinet
were
all
coming
up
to
say
to
me
i
had
seen
the
directors
earlier
in
the
day
so
madame
de
zuylen
took
her
leave
promising
to
come
to
my
christmas
tree
in
the
rue
dumont
the
young
men
seemed
sorry
to
say
i
was
too
i
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
them
and
always
found
them
ready
and
anxious
to
help
me
in
every
way
the
comte
de
lasteyrie
who
was
a
great
friend
of
ours
as
well
as
a
secretary
went
about
a
great
deal
with
us
called
upon
him
very
often
for
all
sorts
of
things
knowing
he
could
trust
him
absolutely
he
told
one
of
my
friends
that
one
of
his
principal
functions
was
to
accompany
madame
waddington
to
all
the
charity
sales
carrying
a
package
of
women
chemises
under
his
arm
it
was
quite
true
that
i
often
bought
poor
clothes
at
the
sales
the
objects
exposed
in
the
way
of
screens
pincushions
and
in
the
spring
hats
made
by
some
of
the
ladies
were
so
appalling
that
i
was
glad
to
have
poor
clothes
to
fall
back
upon
but
i
do
remember
his
ever
carrying
my
purchases
home
with
me
they
were
much
amused
when
suddenly
francis
burst
into
the
room
having
escaped
a
moment
from
his
nonnon
who
was
busy
with
her
last
packing
his
little
face
flushed
and
quivering
with
anger
because
his
toys
had
been
packed
and
he
was
to
be
taken
away
from
the
big
house
he
kicked
and
screamed
like
a
little
mad
thing
until
his
nurse
came
to
the
rescue
i
made
a
last
turn
in
the
rooms
to
see
that
all
trace
of
my
occupation
had
vanished
francis
half
pacified
was
seated
on
the
an
old
huissier
who
was
always
on
duty
taking
care
of
him
the
huissiers
and
house
servants
were
all
assembled
in
the
hall
and
the
old
pierson
who
had
been
there
for
years
was
the
spokesman
and
hoped
respectfully
that
madame
would
soon
come
back
did
come
with
us
as
he
still
had
people
to
see
and
only
got
home
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
we
dined
that
night
and
for
many
nights
afterward
with
our
uncle
lutteroth
who
had
a
charming
hotel
filled
with
pictures
and
bibelots
and
pretty
things
just
across
the
street
as
it
was
some
little
time
before
our
kitchen
and
household
got
into
working
order
again
the
first
few
days
were
of
course
very
tiring
and
uncomfortable
the
house
seemed
so
small
after
the
big
rooms
at
the
quai
i
attempt
to
do
anything
with
the
salons
as
we
were
going
away
so
soon
carpets
and
curtains
had
to
be
arranged
to
keep
the
cold
out
but
the
big
boxes
remained
in
the
carriage
house
not
unpacked
we
had
a
procession
of
visitors
all
day
and
tried
to
make
library
possible
comfortable
it
was
as
there
were
packages
of
books
and
papers
and
boxes
everywhere
i
had
a
good
many
visits
and
flowers
on
new
year
day
which
was
an
agreeable
surprise
lord
lyons
orloff
the
sibberns
comte
de
ségur
alfred
andré
and
others
andré
an
old
friend
of
a
very
conservative
protestant
banker
was
very
blue
about
affairs
andré
was
the
type
of
the
modern
french
protestant
they
are
almost
a
separate
class
in
france
are
very
earnest
religious
honourable
people
they
give
a
great
deal
in
charity
and
good
works
of
all
kinds
in
paris
the
protestant
coterie
is
very
rich
they
associate
with
all
the
catholics
as
many
of
them
entertain
a
great
deal
but
they
live
among
themselves
and
never
intermarry
i
hardly
know
a
case
where
a
french
protestant
has
married
a
catholic
i
suppose
it
is
a
remnant
of
their
old
huguenot
blood
and
the
memories
of
all
their
forefathers
suffered
for
their
religion
which
makes
them
so
intolerant
the
ambassadors
had
paid
their
usual
official
visit
to
the
elysée
said
grévy
was
very
smiling
and
amiable
did
seem
at
all
preoccupied
we
had
a
family
dinner
at
my
uncle
on
new
year
night
and
all
the
family
with
wonderful
unanimity
said
the
best
wish
they
could
make
for
was
that
would
see
him
out
of
politics
and
leading
an
independent
if
less
interesting
life
an
interesting
life
it
certainly
was
hearing
so
many
questions
discussed
seeing
all
sorts
of
people
of
all
nationalities
and
living
as
it
were
behind
the
scenes
the
chamber
of
deputies
in
itself
was
a
study
with
its
astounding
changes
of
opinion
with
no
apparent
cause
one
never
knew
in
the
morning
what
the
afternoon
session
would
bring
for
as
soon
as
the
republican
party
felt
themselves
firmly
established
they
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
i
went
back
to
the
ministry
one
afternoon
to
pay
a
formal
visit
to
madame
de
freycinet
on
her
reception
day
i
had
rather
put
it
off
thinking
that
the
sight
of
the
rooms
and
faces
would
be
disagreeable
to
me
and
make
me
regret
perhaps
the
past
but
i
felt
already
that
all
that
old
life
was
over
one
adapts
one
self
so
quickly
to
different
surroundings
it
did
seem
funny
to
be
announced
by
my
own
special
huissier
gérard
and
to
find
myself
sitting
in
the
green
with
all
the
palms
and
flowers
arranged
just
as
they
always
were
for
me
and
a
semicircle
of
diplomats
saying
exactly
the
same
things
to
madame
de
freycinet
that
they
had
said
to
me
a
few
days
before
but
i
fancy
that
always
happens
in
these
days
of
democracy
and
equalising
education
and
that
under
certain
circumstances
we
all
say
and
do
exactly
the
same
thing
i
had
quite
a
talk
with
sibbern
the
swedish
minister
who
was
very
friendly
and
sympathetic
not
only
at
our
leaving
the
foreign
office
but
at
the
extreme
discomfort
of
moving
in
such
frightfully
cold
weather
he
was
wrapped
in
furs
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
north
pole
however
i
assured
him
we
were
quite
warm
and
comfortable
gradually
settling
down
into
our
old
ways
and
i
was
already
looking
back
on
my
two
years
at
the
quai
as
an
agreeable
episode
in
my
life
i
had
quite
a
talk
too
with
the
portuguese
minister
mendes
leal
he
was
an
interesting
man
a
poet
and
a
dreamer
saw
more
i
fancy
of
the
literary
world
of
paris
than
the
political
blowitz
was
there
of
course
was
always
everywhere
in
moments
of
crisis
talking
a
great
deal
and
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
had
pulled
a
great
many
wires
all
those
last
weeks
he
too
regretted
that
had
not
taken
the
london
embassy
assured
me
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
agreeable
appointment
in
england
was
surprised
that
i
had
urged
it
i
replied
that
i
had
not
been
consulted
many
people
asked
when
they
could
come
and
see
me
would
i
take
up
my
reception
day
again
that
was
worth
while
as
i
was
going
away
so
soon
but
i
said
i
would
be
there
every
day
at
five
and
always
had
visits

carnot
from
a
drawing
by
mlle
amelie
one
day
madame
sadi
carnot
sat
a
long
time
with
me
her
husband
had
been
named
undersecretary
at
the
ministry
of
public
works
in
the
new
cabinet
and
she
was
very
pleased
she
was
a
very
charming
intelligent
cultivated
woman
read
a
great
deal
was
very
keen
about
politics
and
very
ambitious
as
every
clever
woman
should
be
for
her
husband
and
sons
i
think
she
was
a
great
help
socially
to
her
husband
when
he
became
president
of
the
republic
he
was
a
grave
reserved
man
care
very
much
for
society
i
saw
her
very
often
and
always
found
her
most
attractive
at
the
elysée
she
was
amiable
and
courteous
to
everybody
and
her
slight
deafness
did
seem
to
worry
her
nor
make
conversation
difficult
she
did
such
a
charming
womanly
thing
just
after
her
husband
assassination
he
lay
in
state
for
some
days
at
the
elysée
and
casimir
périer
his
successor
went
to
make
her
a
visit
as
he
was
leaving
he
said
his
wife
would
come
the
next
day
to
see
madame
carnot
she
instantly
answered
pray
do
not
let
her
come
she
is
young
beginning
her
life
here
at
the
elysée
i
would
for
worlds
that
she
should
have
the
impression
of
sadness
and
gloom
that
must
hang
over
the
palace
as
long
as
the
president
is
lying
there
i
should
like
her
to
come
to
the
elysée
only
when
all
traces
of
this
tragedy
have
gone
and
to
have
no
sad
associations
on
the
contrary
with
the
prospect
of
a
long
happy
future
before
her
illustration

pierre
petit
president
sadi
carnot
went
the
two
or
three
fridays
we
were
in
paris
to
the
institute
where
he
was
most
warmly
received
by
his
colleagues
who
had
much
regretted
his
enforced
absences
the
years
he
was
at
the
foreign
office
he
told
them
he
was
going
to
rome
where
he
hoped
still
to
find
some
treasures
in
the
shape
of
inscriptions
inédites
with
the
help
of
his
friend
lanciani
the
days
passed
quickly
enough
until
we
started
it
was
not
altogether
a
rest
as
there
were
always
so
many
people
at
the
house
and
wanted
to
put
order
into
his
papers
before
he
left
freycinet
made
various
changes
at
the
quai
desprey
directeur
de
la
politique
a
post
he
had
occupied
for
years
was
named
ambassador
to
rome
in
the
place
of
the
marquis
de
gabriac
i
do
think
he
was
very
anxious
to
go
his
career
had
been
made
almost
entirely
at
the
foreign
office
and
he
was
much
more
at
home
in
his
cabinet
with
all
his
papers
and
books
about
him
than
he
would
be
abroad
among
strangers
he
came
to
dinner
one
night
and
we
talked
the
thing
over
thought
the
rest
and
change
would
do
him
good
he
was
named
to
the
vatican
where
necessarily
there
was
much
less
to
do
in
the
way
of
social
life
than
at
the
quirinal
he
was
perfectly
au
courant
of
all
the
questions
between
the
vatican
and
the
french
clergy
his
son
secretary
of
embassy
would
go
with
him
it
seemed
rather
a
pleasant
prospect
went
once
or
twice
to
the
senate
as
the
houses
met
on
the
or
of
january
but
there
was
nothing
very
interesting
those
first
days
the
chamber
was
taking
breath
after
the
holidays
and
the
last
ministerial
crisis
and
giving
the
new
ministry
a
chance
i
think
freycinet
had
his
hands
full
but
he
was
quite
equal
to
the
task
i
went
late
one
afternoon
to
the
elysée
i
had
written
to
madame
grévy
to
ask
if
she
would
receive
me
before
i
left
for
italy
when
i
arrived
the
one
footman
at
the
door
told
me
madame
grévy
was
un
peu
souffrante
would
see
me
i
went
up
a
side
staircase
rather
dark
preceded
by
the
footman
who
ushered
me
into
madame
grévy
bedroom
it
looked
perfectly
uncomfortable
was
large
with
very
high
ceilings
stiff
gilt
furniture
standing
against
the
wall
and
the
heat
something
awful
a
blazing
fire
in
the
chimney
madame
grévy
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
near
the
fire
a
grey
shawl
on
her
shoulders
and
a
lace
fichu
on
her
head
it
was
curiously
unlike
the
bedroom
i
had
just
left
i
had
been
to
see
a
friend
who
was
also
souffrante
she
was
lying
under
a
lace
coverlet
lined
with
pink
silk
lace
and
embroidered
cushions
all
around
her
flowers
pink
silver
flacons
everything
most
luxurious
and
modern
the
contrast
was
striking
madame
grévy
was
very
civil
and
talkative
said
she
was
very
tired
the
big
dinners
and
late
hours
she
found
very
fatiguing
she
quite
understood
that
i
was
glad
to
get
away
but
did
think
it
was
very
prudent
to
travel
in
such
bitterly
cold
weather
and
rome
was
very
far
and
was
i
afraid
of
fever
i
told
her
i
was
an
old
roman
had
lived
there
for
years
knew
the
climate
well
and
did
think
it
was
worse
than
any
other
she
said
the
president
had
had
a
visit
from
and
a
very
long
talk
with
him
and
that
he
regretted
his
departure
very
much
but
that
he
did
think
monsieur
waddington
was
au
fond
de
son
sac
grévy
was
always
a
good
friend
to
on
one
or
two
occasions
when
there
was
a
sort
of
cabal
against
him
grévy
took
his
part
very
warmly
and
in
all
questions
of
home
policy
and
persons
found
him
a
very
keen
shrewd
observer
though
he
said
very
little
rarely
expressed
an
opinion
i
did
make
a
very
long
visit
found
my
way
as
well
as
i
could
no
servant
was
visible
either
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
hall
and
my
own
footman
opened
the
big
doors
and
let
me
out
we
got
off
the
first
days
of
february
as
up
to
the
last
moment
had
people
to
see
we
went
for
two
or
three
days
to
bourneville
i
had
one
or
two
very
cold
tramps
in
the
woods
very
dry
which
is
quite
unusual
at
this
time
of
the
year
but
the
earth
was
frozen
hard
inside
the
woods
we
were
well
sheltered
but
when
we
came
out
on
the
plain
the
cold
and
icy
wind
was
awful
the
workmen
had
made
fires
to
burn
the
roots
and
rotten
wood
and
we
were
very
glad
to
stop
and
warm
ourselves
some
had
their
children
with
them
who
looked
half
perished
with
cold
always
insufficiently
clad
but
they
were
quite
happy
roasting
potatoes
in
the
ashes
i
was
so
cold
that
i
tied
a
woollen
scarf
around
my
head
just
as
the
women
in
canada
do
when
they
go
sleighing
or
skating
we
had
a
breakfast
one
day
for
some
of
influential
men
in
the
country
who
were
much
disgusted
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
and
that
could
no
longer
remain
minister
but
they
were
very
fairly
au
courant
of
all
that
was
going
on
in
parliament
and
quite
understood
that
for
the
moment
the
moderate
experienced
men
had
no
chance
the
young
republic
must
have
its
fling
has
the

learned
much
