in

briefly
record
the
fact
that
on
monday
the
day
of
may
justice
bayley
as
senior
puisne
judge
of
the
court
of
bench
in
a
and
gentle
passed
the
above
unexampled
sentence
upon
me
for
having
attended
a
public
meeting
at
manchester
by
the
invitation
of
seven
hundred
inhabitant
householders
of
that
town
who
signed
a
requisition
to
the
boroughreeve
to
call
the
said
meeting
on
the
day
of
august
last
for
the
purpose
of
taking
into
consideration
the
best
and
most
legal
means
of
obtaining
a
reform
in
the
commons
house
of
parliament
this
meeting
was
no
sooner
assembled
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
persons
young
and
old
of
both
sexes
in
the
most
peaceable
and
orderly
manner
than
they
were
assailed
by
the
manchester
yeomanry
cavalry
who
charged
the
multitude
sword
in
hand
and
without
the
slightest
provocation
or
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
people
as
was
clearly
proved
by
the
trial
at
york
aided
by
two
troops
of
the
cheshire
yeomanry
the
hussars
the
regiment
of
foot
and
two
pieces
of
flying
artillery
sabred
trampled
upon
and
dispersed
the
unoffending
and
unresisting
people
when
persons
were
killed
and
upwards
of
wounded
i
and
eleven
others
having
by
a
mere
miracle
escaped
the
military
execution
intended
for
us
were
seized
and
confined
in
solitary
dungeons
in
the
new
bailey
for
eleven
days
and
nights
under
a
pretended
charge
of
high
treason
at
the
end
of
that
time
upon
a
final
examination
i
was
sent
under
a
military
escort
upwards
of
fifty
miles
to
lancaster
castle
although
bail
was
ready
and
waiting
to
be
put
in
for
me
after
this
sentence
was
passed
i
was
sent
to
the
king
bench
prison
where
i
was
confined
till
four
on
the
wednesday
following
when
i
was
conveyed
in
a
chaise
to
this
prison
where
i
arrived
at
ten
the
same
night
being
a
distance
of
miles
thus
after
having
been
confined
in
separate
since
the
of
august
the
new
bailey
at
manchester
lancaster
castle
and
the
king
bench
i
am
doomed
finally
to
be
incarcerated
in
a
dungeon
of
this
the
for
two
years
and
six
months
while
of
and
those
benevolent
gentlemen
of
the
manchester
yeomanry
cavalry
are
at
large
without
even
the
chance
of
any
proceedings
that
might
lead
to
the
punishment
of
their
crimes
being
instituted
against
them
yet
we
are
gravely
told
from
the
bench
that
the
laws
are
equally
administered
to
the
and
to
the
of
the
truth
of
which
assertion
the
above
will
in
future
ages
appear
as
an
unexampled
specimen
in
addressing
this
work
to
you
my
brave
patient
and
persecuted
friends
i
hope
to
have
an
opportunity
of
communicating
with
you
once
a
month
during
my
incarceration
and
during
the
progress
of
the
work
i
shall
take
care
to
avoid
all
exaggerated
statements
i
shall
confine
myself
to
a
strict
relation
of
facts
and
i
shall
be
very
particular
not
to
gloss
over
or
slight
any
one
political
or
public
act
of
my
life
you
shall
be
in
possession
of
the
faithful
history
of
whom
you
have
so
unanimously
honoured
by
the
denomination
of
your
and
in
whose
incarceration
a
deadly
blow
is
with
savage
ferocity
aimed
at
your
rights
and
liberties
one
who
during
his
whole
political
career
will
be
found
to
have
been
the
consistent
and
undeviating
advocate
of
or
one
who
always
under
every
difficulty
at
all
times
and
seasons
boldly
and
unequivocally
claimed
for
the
people
the
right
of
every
man
to
have
a
vote
for
the
members
of
the
commons
house
of
parliament
and
who
never
under
any
circumstances
paltered
or
compromised
the
great
constitutional
principle
that
englishman
should
be
taxed
without
his
own
even
when
its
most
zealous
professed
advocates
had
abandoned
the
intention
of
maintaining
this
proposition
even
at
the
risk
of
loosing
the
friendship
of
his
dearest
political
connections
he
stood
firm
upon
the
solid
basis
of
that
incontrovertible
principle
justice
and
freedom
to
no
pretended
expediency
no
crafty
policy
although
urged
with
the
greatest
force
and
zeal
by
the
most
experienced
and
acute
reasoners
neither
flattery
bribes
nor
threats
could
ever
for
one
moment
shake
his
determination
to
support
the
principle
of
universal
suffrage
or
in
other
words
the
right
of
every
freeman
to
have
a
share
by
his
representative
in
the
making
of
those
laws
by
which
his
life
his
liberty
and
his
property
are
to
be
governed
and
disposed
of
i
allude
more
particularly
to
the
meeting
of
delegates
by
some
called
deputies
in
london
some
time
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
principle
of
was
nothing
new
i
claim
no
merit
in
having
proposed
any
thing
novel
this
right
is
as
old
as
the
constitution
of
england
it
had
been
advocated
by
sir
robert
afterwards
lord
raymond
by
sir
william
jones
and
afterwards
with
great
perseverance
and
ability
by
the
duke
of
richmond
who
brought
a
bill
into
the
house
of
lords
in
which
he
claimed
this
right
for
the
people
and
proposed
to
carry
it
into
execution
at
that
time
however
no
part
of
the
people
had
petitioned
for
it
and
the
bill
was
thrown
out
at
that
period
the
attention
of
the
populace
of
the
metropolis
was
directed
to
other
matters
they
were
engaged
in
lord
george
gordon
disgraceful
riots
the
duke
of
richmond
disgusted
at
the
apathy
of
the
reformers
to
which
he
attributed
the
failure
of
his
favourite
measure
soon
afterwards
accepted
a
place
as
master
general
of
the
ordnance
and
became
a
complete
tool
of
the
ministers
the
cause
of
reform
languished
till
the
year
although
major
cartwright
sir
burdett
cobbett
myself
and
many
others
had
made
frequent
efforts
to
call
the
people
attention
to
the
only
measure
calculated
to
check
the
progress
the
fatal
progress
of
corruption
and
its
consequent
effects
unjust
and
unnecessary
war
profligate
expenditure
the
funding
or
system
and
the
rapid
annual
increase
of
a
ruinous
and
irredeemable
debt
it
will
be
said
that
these
subjects
will
naturally
be
included
in
and
make
part
of
my
history
they
certainly
will
but
there
is
one
circumstance
connected
with
the
events
of
and
which
is
very
imperfectly
known
to
any
of
the
reformers
and
which
i
feel
it
a
duty
to
detail
to
them
all
before
i
proceed
any
further
in
the
latter
end
of
the
year
and
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
evil
effects
of
the
war
began
to
be
severely
felt
amongst
all
classes
throughout
the
country
and
in
the
north
of
england
it
was
particularly
felt
by
those
employed
in
the
manufactories
great
disturbances
prevailed
and
the
luddites
as
they
were
called
committed
repeated
depredations
by
destroying
the
machinery
of
their
employers
this
ultimately
led
to
the
employment
of
spies
and
informers
by
the
agents
of
the
government
by
which
means
many
of
the
unhappy
men
were
convicted
and
executed
major
cartwright
and
cobbett
in
the
most
laudable
and
praiseworthy
manner
endeavoured
by
their
writings
and
the
major
i
believe
by
going
amongst
them
personally
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
starving
manufacturers
to
the
real
cause
of
their
distress
and
recommended
them
to
petition
for
reform
instead
of
destroying
the
machinery
this
had
the
desired
effect
and
petitions
drawn
up
by
the
major
praying
for
reform
in
the
commons
house
of
parliament
and
demanding
suffrage
for
those
who
paid
taxes
poured
in
from
all
quarters
in
the
beginning
of
november
some
persons
in
london
advertised
and
called
a
public
meeting
of
the
distressed
inhabitants
of
the
metropolis
to
be
held
in
spafields
on
the
this
originated
with
watson
and
some
of
those
who
called
themselves
spenceans
as
i
have
learned
since
they
sent
invitations
to
sir
francis
burdett
major
cartwright
myself
and
lord
cochrane
and
even
to
waithman
and
several
other
political
characters
earnestly
requesting
them
to
attend
the
meeting
to
advise
with
and
to
assist
their
distressed
fellow
creatures
as
to
the
best
means
of
obtaining
relief
in
the
mean
time
the
parties
calling
the
meeting
had
drawn
up
and
prepared
a
to
the
prince
regent
which
was
if
passed
to
have
been
carried
immediately
to
carlton
house
by
the
whole
of
the
meeting
and
presented
in
person
to
the
regent
when
the
day
arrived
of
all
the
persons
invited
as
political
characters
to
the
meeting
was
the
only
one
who
attended
and
having
prevailed
upon
those
who
called
the
meeting
to
abandon
their
famous
memorial
and
to
relinquish
the
plan
of
going
in
a
body
to
carlton
house
i
proposed
the
resolutions
and
the
petition
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
which
the
next
day
i
caused
to
be
presented
to
him
by
lord
sidmouth
on
the
following
day
his
royal
highness
was
pleased
so
far
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
petitioners
as
to
send
four
thousand
pounds
as
a
subscription
to
the
spitalfields
soup
committee
the
resolutions
proposed
by
me
and
unanimously
passed
by
the
most
numerous
meeting
ever
held
in
this
country
avowed
the
principle
of
universal
suffrage
and
the
petition
to
the
regent
claimed
his
pecuniary
assistance
as
an
immediate
and
temporary
relief
but
declared
that
the
petitioners
had
no
hope
or
expectation
of
permanent
prosperity
and
happiness
till
a
reform
of
parliament
was
effected
which
would
give
to
a
vote
in
the
representation
this
was
therefore
the
first
time
that
was
petitioned
for
at
a
public
meeting
and
i
had
the
honour
and
i
shall
ever
feel
a
pride
in
the
reflection
of
being
the
first
man
who
publicly
proposed
at
a
meeting
of
the
reformers
this
measure
and
of
having
caused
to
be
presented
the
first
petition
to
the
throne
praying
the
prince
to
assist
the
people
in
recovering
their
right
of
universal
suffrage
in
the
election
of
members
of
the
house
of
commons
you
must
all
recollect
the
infamous
manner
in
which
i
was
attacked
and
assailed
by
the
whole
of
the
daily
london
press
at
that
time
with
the
single
exception
of
however
the
reformers
of
the
north
south
east
and
west
became
instantly
alive
to
the
appeal
that
was
made
to
them
in
the
resolutions
passed
at
spa
fields
public
meetings
were
held
and
petitions
to
the
house
of
commons
were
signed
all
praying
for
and
by
the
time
of
the
meeting
of
parliament
the
delegates
from
petitioning
bodies
came
up
to
town
in
consequence
of
a
circular
letter
signed
by
sir
francis
burdett
to
consult
and
to
settle
upon
the
extent
of
suffrage
and
other
matters
to
be
recommended
for
the
adoption
of
all
the
petitioning
bodies
of
reformers
throughout
the
country
this
was
most
unnecessary
for
they
had
and
already
adopted
the
principle
and
followed
the
example
set
them
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
metropolis
at
spa
fields
when
the
delegates
were
arrived
from
yorkshire
lancashire
and
most
of
the
counties
in
the
north
from
bristol
and
other
places
in
the
west
with
the
petitions
entrusted
to
them
the
signatures
to
which
together
with
those
of
the
petitions
previously
sent
up
did
not
amount
to
less
than
half
a
million
i
came
to
town
as
the
delegate
from
bath
and
bristol
both
of
which
cities
had
held
public
meetings
most
numerously
attended
and
passed
similar
resolutions
to
those
agreed
to
at
spa
fields
the
reformers
from
each
of
those
cities
had
sent
me
up
a
petition
to
be
presented
to
the
house
of
commons
praying
for
one
signed
by
and
the
other
by
persons
to
be
brief
here
for
i
shall
detail
the
circumstances
more
fully
hereafter
as
they
make
a
most
important
epoch
of
my
life
the
delegates
met
in
number
at
the
crown
and
anchor
major
cartwright
in
the
chair
who
together
with
jones
burdett
attended
as
a
deputation
from
the
hampden
club
the
major
in
opening
the
business
of
the
day
stated
that
the
members
of
the
hampden
club
with
sir
francis
burdett
at
their
head
had
come
to
a
resolution
to
support
suffrage
to
the
extent
of
householders
no
further
and
that
they
recommended
the
adoption
of
this
plan
to
the
delegates
the
major
was
particularly
eloquent
and
went
out
of
the
usual
course
of
a
chairman
by
requesting
almost
as
a
personal
favour
to
himself
that
the
delegates
would
adopt
the
recommendation
of
the
hampden
club
cobbett
then
rose
and
in
a
speech
replete
with
every
argument
which
this
most
clear
and
powerful
reasoner
could
suggest
proposed
the
first
resolution
that
the
meeting
should
adopt
the
recommendation
of
the
hampden
club
and
agree
to
recommend
the
reformers
to
petition
to
the
extent
of
suffrage
only
urging
as
major
cartwright
had
done
before
the
necessity
of
agreeing
to
this
plan
because
sir
burdett
had
positively
refused
to
support
any
petitions
for
universal
suffrage
this
resolution
was
seconded
by
jno
allen
my
brother
delegate
from
bath
although
he
had
positive
instructions
not
to
agree
to
any
thing
short
of
universal
suffrage
but
cobbett
powerful
though
fallacious
reasoning
had
convinced
him
of
the
necessity
of
curtailing
the
right
to
householders
only
i
rose
and
moved
an
amendment
substituting
for
and
with
all
the
reasoning
and
energy
in
my
power
i
combated
the
arguments
of
my
friends
cobbett
and
major
cartwright
deprecating
the
policy
that
would
deprive
of
the
population
of
the
inherent
birthright
of
every
freeman
my
proposition
and
the
whole
of
the
arguments
i
used
in
its
support
were
received
by
a
very
large
majority
of
the
delegates
with
enthusiastic
approbation
so
much
so
that
it
convinced
cobbett
of
the
folly
as
well
as
the
inutility
of
persisting
in
his
motion
my
amendment
having
been
seconded
by
hulme
from
bolton
in
lancashire
and
being
supported
by
a
very
ingenious
argument
of
my
brave
friend
and
fellow
prisoner
now
in
lincoln
castle
bamford
cobbett
rose
and
begged
to
withdraw
his
motion
he
having
been
convinced
of
the
practicability
of
universal
suffrage
by
the
speech
of
bamford
who
had
at
the
time
only
said
a
few
words
upon
that
subject
the
question
was
put
and
carried
it
against
there
being
for
my
amendment
i
think
and
only
for
the
householder
plan
thus
then
my
friends
whether
i
was
right
or
whether
i
was
wrong
i
not
only
was
the
first
to
propose
the
adoption
of
the
wild
and
visionary
scheme
of
at
a
great
public
meeting
but
i
also
stood
firm
to
the
cause
when
those
who
have
since
so
ably
advocated
the
principle
were
in
evil
hour
from
policy
about
to
abandon
it
let
therefore
all
the
blame
of
the
reformers
having
so
determinedly
advocated
the
wild
and
visionary
scheme
of
rest
upon
my
shoulders
which
thank
god
are
quite
broad
enough
to
bear
it
without
feeling
it
in
any
degree
burdensome
particularly
as
sir
burdett
has
at
length
come
fully
up
to
our
mark
from
that
time
to
this
i
have
never
deviated
from
never
shifted
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
but
always
at
all
times
through
good
report
and
through
evil
report
undisguisedly
enforced
and
maintained
with
all
the
ability
i
possessed
the
right
of
the
whole
of
my
to
be
fairly
and
freely
represented
in
the
commons
house
of
parliament
if
there
be
any
merit
in
what
was
then
called
a
stubborn
and
pertinacious
adherence
to
this
great
principle
i
am
only
entitled
to
share
that
merit
jointly
with
hulme
bamford
and
the
other
brave
and
patriotic
men
who
came
from
different
parts
of
the
country
as
delegates
without
their
manly
support
this
measure
would
have
been
lost
and
the
reformers
throughout
the
kingdom
would
then
have
been
recommended
to
abandon
the
high
ground
they
had
taken
to
give
up
petitions
already
signed
by
half
a
million
of
men
for
and
in
its
stead
to
petition
for
suffrage
to
the
extent
of
or
to
the
payers
of
having
established
this
position
for
the
correctness
of
which
i
appeal
to
all
the
delegates
who
were
present
i
shall
leave
it
for
the
present
although
there
are
very
important
matters
and
some
curious
connected
with
the
events
of
that
period
which
have
never
yet
appeared
before
the
public
which
must
come
out
and
which
will
form
a
very
material
part
of
my
history
the
government
or
rather
the
ministers
had
their
eye
upon
this
meeting
of
delegates
and
they
well
knew
all
that
passed
there
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
six
months
of
my
imprisonment
may
be
fairly
placed
to
the
account
of
what
the
editor
of
the
macclesfield
courier
called
my
most
uncompromising
perseverance
the
editor
of
an
obscure
sunday
london
newspaper
in
observing
upon
my
sentence
says
most
exultingly
game
its
now
with
this
man
we
have
done
to
the
people
we
now
turn
and
what
do
you
think
he
means
to
do
how
does
he
propose
to
relieve
their
distresses
in
speaking
of
your
prospects
of
relief
he
says
they
must
for
a
time
it
would
be
vain
to
deny
this
it
would
be
dishonest
to
hold
out
any
other
it
remains
with
themselves
whether
their
sufferings
be
long
or
short
so
this
gentleman
tells
you
first
that
the
game
is
up
and
then
he
consoles
you
by
telling
you
that
the
game
is
in
your
own
hands
was
there
ever
such
paltering
ever
such
base
and
stupid
attempts
to
delude
rational
beings
the
of
the
of
may
a
few
days
after
my
sentence
gives
vent
to
his
malignant
joy
in
the
following
words
the
political
matters
of
fact
of
the
last
month
will
descend
to
posterity
as
the
proudest
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
never
at
any
period
since
trial
by
jury
has
been
the
stipulation
of
our
allegiance
never
has
that
grand
perfection
of
justice
been
more
sacredly
guarded
the
trial
of
hunt
at
york
is
a
precedent
of
almost
unattainable
impartiality
in
judicial
proceedings
pending
that
trial
the
reports
of
its
progress
gave
radicalism
a
confidence
it
undisguisedly
evinced
that
the
result
would
be
favourable
to
its
heart
worst
wishes
the
of
faction
were
in
full
rehearsal
when
the
bringers
of
announced
the
triumph
of
truth
the
conviction
of
a
on
was
expected
in
sulky
helplessness
but
the
overthrow
of
the
champion
of
liberty
the
orator
whose
eloquence
was
to
have
been
the
passing
dirge
of
justice
overthrow
was
the
overthrow
of
thousands
with
hearts
sunk
and
menaces
grew
silent
the
monster
at
his
whetstone
dropped
the
dagger
at
the
conviction
of
and
the
tool
of
his
excitement
unscrewed
the
and
threw
away
the
musquet
i
have
no
hesitation
in
declaring
that
the
numerous
verdicts
for
the
crown
that
of
late
have
asserted
the
majesty
of
law
including
the
convictions
of
high
treason
have
not
done
half
so
much
for
the
real
interest
of
social
quiet
as
the
radically
conviction
of
lord
of
the
manor
of
this
you
see
my
friends
of
yorkshire
is
meant
to
quiet
the
conscience
of
septimus
bromley
and
his
brother
talesman
the
special
gentlemen
being
above
any
thing
of
the
sort
i
wish
some
friend
who
lives
near
the
said
would
give
me
a
line
and
tell
me
who
and
what
he
is
and
what
he
says
for
himself
i
hope
some
radical
in
his
neighbourhood
will
send
me
a
good
and
particular
account
of
this
gentleman
but
i
see
by
the
newspapers
that
the
is
not
quite
or
if
it
is
a
new
game
is
begun
if
the
honourable
house
have
got
rid
of
one
set
of
petitioners
a
new
set
is
sprung
up
not
of
radicals
to
be
sure
but
a
set
of
agriculturists
merchants
manufacturers
and
shipowners
who
all
appear
to
be
petitioning
against
each
other
or
at
least
each
of
them
is
petitioning
for
that
which
would
add
to
the
distress
and
ruin
of
the
other
the
honourable
house
is
placed
in
a
very
ticklish
and
delicate
situation
it
does
not
dare
to
serve
the
petitions
of
these
new
applicants
as
they
did
our
petitions
my
friends
for
reform
kick
them
out
of
the
house
but
having
for
the
present
got
rid
of
the
radicals
they
have
now
plenty
of
leisure
to
attend
to
the
numerous
petitions
of
all
the
rest
of
the
community
the
yeomanry
cavalry
good
souls
they
are
in
distress
and
they
want
another
corn
bill
but
then
you
see
his
majesty
ministers
creatures
and
the
considerate
merchants
the
and
the
they
say
this
must
not
be
by
management
the
corn
gentry
got
a
majority
my
lord
castlereagh
is
quite
shocked
and
even
holme
sumner
benevolent
heart
he
is
quite
astounded
with
the
unexpected
and
undeserved
success
of
his
own
motion
mark
their
proceedings
well
my
friends
for
you
to
petition
i
fear
will
be
in
vain
but
mark
their
proceedings
it
so
very
much
resembles
the
proceedings
when
the
last
corn
bill
was
passed
that
i
have
little
doubt
there
is
foul
play
going
on
somewhere
the
farmers
can
not
pay
their
and
unless
they
can
do
it
by
a
rise
in
the
price
of
the
baring
and
ricardo
do
not
approve
of
this
each
of
them
has
his
scheme
for
the
relief
of
the
general
distress
agricultural
and
all
baring
hints
but
he
only
hints
at
something
he
hints
that
should
be
and
his
brother
ricardo
proposes
then
to
pay
off
the
national
debt
by
making
the
pay
down
at
once
per
cent
upon
the
value
of
their
estates
the
honourable
members
stare
with
astonishment
at
the
propositions
of
these
wise
and
well
they
may
although
the
game
may
be
up
although
the
assertion
of
the
editor
of
the
morning
post
may
be
true
that
the
verdict
against
henry
hunt
has
proved
the
overthrow
of
thousands
and
rendered
twice
as
much
service
to
the
real
interest
of
social
quiet
as
all
the
other
verdicts
for
the
crown
put
together
yet
i
perceive
by
the
language
of
a
petition
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
kirkeaton
presented
to
the
honourable
house
by
my
lord
milton
that
even
the
locking
me
up
in
a
jail
in
consequence
of
this
verdict
has
neither
contributed
to
remove
the
distress
nor
to
put
food
into
the
mouths
of
the
poor
reformers
of
kirkeaton
good
god
of
heaven
what
must
lord
milton
be
made
of
to
present
present
a
petition
shewing
that
of
his
constituents
in
one
parish
had
been
and
were
living
or
rather
starving
upon
each
per
week
that
the
average
income
of
human
beings
in
that
county
yorkshire
where
he
is
their
is
under
per
head
per
week
gracious
god
the
present
member
for
this
county
sir
thomas
lethbridge
once
declared
in
the
honourable
house
that
the
language
of
sir
francis
burdett
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
upon
his
head
to
have
seen
lord
milton
present
such
a
petition
as
this
to
have
heard
the
officer
of
the
honourable
house
mumble
out
a
description
a
recital
of
the
privations
and
cruel
sufferings
of
my
poor
insulted
fellow
countrymen
of
kirkeaton
without
rising
to
say
one
word
in
their
behalf
without
calling
down
the
vengeance
of
heaven
and
earth
upon
the
heads
of
those
who
had
by
their
acts
reduced
the
country
to
such
a
state
of
wretchedness
and
woe
to
have
witnessed
this
i
say
although
it
might
not
have
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
it
would
i
am
sure
have
chilled
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
i
can
conscientiously
say
that
the
mere
reading
in
the
times
newspaper
the
account
of
your
cruel
sufferings
my
poor
countrymen
of
kirkeaton
has
given
me
more
pain
than
a
years
imprisonment
would
have
done
if
i
could
have
known
that
you
were
enjoying
a
fair
equivalent
for
your
honest
industry
talk
of
imprisonment
indeed
why
it
is
a
perfect
paradise
compared
with
the
wants
and
privations
which
you
are
doomed
to
endure
the
situation
of
a
prisoner
in
this
jail
let
him
be
confined
for
any
thing
less
than
high
treason
or
murder
is
heaven
upon
earth
compared
to
your
lot
let
us
see
there
is
a
prisoner
who
is
appointed
to
wait
upon
me
here
an
old
soldier
who
has
enjoyed
rank
in
the
army
as
an
adjutant
but
having
a
large
family
and
meeting
with
many
reverses
of
fortune
he
became
reduced
in
his
circumstances
and
in
consequence
of
great
persecutions
was
at
length
driven
to
seek
relief
from
the
parish
the
sufferings
and
privations
of
his
wife
and
children
daily
stared
him
in
the
face
without
even
the
hope
of
relief
and
brooding
over
his
unmerited
persecutions
and
neglect
he
was
driven
to
drinking
in
a
fit
of
temporary
delirium
he
attempted
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
himself
and
wife
for
which
he
is
sentenced
to
be
imprisoned
here
for
twelve
months
his
wife
and
family
are
supported
by
the
parish
and
i
will
now
tell
you
what
he
receives
for
his
allowance
exclusive
of
clothes
lodging
fire
and
washing
all
found
by
the
county
he
gets
pound
and
a
half
of
good
bread
and
one
penny
every
ten
pounds
and
a
half
of
good
white
bread
and
sevenpence
to
purchase
potatoes
and
salt
or
milk
per
week
bread
and
pence
at
the
very
lowest
two
shillings
and
per
week
now
if
we
reckon
one
shilling
and
at
the
very
lowest
rate
for
lodging
and
which
are
all
found
in
plenty
and
very
good
of
the
sort
he
receives
the
value
of
four
shillings
per
week
the
bread
is
quite
as
much
as
or
rather
more
than
a
moderate
man
can
eat
and
this
person
who
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
seriously
informs
me
that
he
enjoys
here
happiness
ease
and
comfort
compared
to
what
he
had
to
encounter
out
of
prison
and
as
he
professes
to
be
very
well
pleased
with
waiting
upon
me
he
dreads
the
approach
of
his
release
every
person
in
the
jail
has
the
same
allowance
and
if
they
choose
to
work
the
governor
enables
them
to
earn
from
threepence
up
to
one
shilling
over
now
my
good
friends
of
kirkeaton
although
i
will
not
recommend
you
to
do
any
thing
to
get
sent
to
jail
yet
i
will
tell
you
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
in
your
situation
i
would
work
hard
from
monday
to
saturday
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
if
i
found
that
my
wages
were
not
sufficient
to
support
myself
my
wife
and
children
in
the
common
necessaries
of
life
i
would
on
the
following
monday
try
a
fresh
plan
instead
of
going
to
work
i
would
go
to
a
neighbouring
magistrate
lord
milton
or
lord
fitzwilliam
for
instance
if
they
were
within
reach
and
i
would
tell
him
that
i
had
left
my
wife
and
family
chargeable
to
the
parish
as
i
was
unable
to
support
them
by
my
labour
but
as
i
knew
the
leaving
of
my
family
as
an
incumbrance
upon
the
parish
was
an
offence
against
the
laws
for
which
i
was
liable
to
be
committed
to
prison
and
as
i
did
not
wish
to
give
the
parish
officers
more
trouble
than
was
absolutely
necessary
i
had
come
to
request
his
lordship
to
make
out
my
mittimus
that
i
might
go
to
jail
as
soon
and
as
peaceably
as
possible
i
know
what
the
corrupt
knave
of
the
morning
post
will
say
ha
he
is
in
a
prison
himself
and
he
wants
now
to
get
all
his
followers
there
also
but
suppose
this
were
the
case
which
it
is
not
you
would
not
could
not
be
worse
off
than
lord
constituents
are
but
i
have
said
this
a
thousand
times
within
the
last
five
years
nay
i
always
said
this
seeing
that
a
poor
labouring
man
is
twice
as
well
off
in
a
jail
as
he
is
out
of
it
as
to
meat
drink
washing
and
lodging
now
my
friends
and
fellow
countrymen
the
writing
the
history
of
my
own
life
during
my
confinement
in
a
prison
will
not
i
trust
be
considered
presumption
in
me
because
i
follow
the
example
of
sir
walter
raleigh
and
many
other
patriotic
and
eminent
men
who
have
gone
before
me
i
am
not
much
of
a
copyist
but
i
am
not
ashamed
of
being
accused
of
endeavouring
to
imitate
the
brave
and
persecuted
napoleon
who
is
writing
his
memoirs
during
his
imprisonment
on
the
barren
rock
of
helena
napoleon
i
esteem
the
most
illustrious
and
eminent
man
of
the
present
age
both
as
a
profound
statesman
and
a
brave
and
matchless
general
although
he
never
appeared
to
evince
so
sincere
a
desire
as
could
be
wished
to
promote
the
universal
liberty
of
man
to
the
extent
that
i
contend
and
have
always
contended
for
yet
when
i
reflect
upon
the
period
in
which
his
energetic
mind
was
allowed
to
have
its
full
scope
of
action
and
when
i
recollect
the
powerful
armies
and
fleets
that
he
had
to
contend
with
and
the
phalanx
of
tyrants
who
were
at
various
times
leagued
together
against
him
i
am
disposed
not
to
examine
too
nicely
and
with
too
critical
an
eye
the
means
that
he
used
to
defend
himself
against
their
unceasing
endeavours
to
destroy
him
and
to
restore
the
old
tyranny
of
the
bourbons
he
is
like
myself
a
prisoner
and
imprisoned
by
the
same
power
only
in
his
case
they
have
not
even
the
of
law
to
justify
them
in
his
detention
he
is
a
prisoner
upon
a
barren
rock
but
i
have
not
the
least
hesitation
in
pronouncing
him
to
have
been
both
in
the
cabinet
and
the
field
as
to
talent
and
courage
unrivalled
in
the
pages
of
modern
or
ancient
history
neither
the
reformers
nor
the
people
of
england
had
any
share
in
sending
him
to
helena
nor
ought
they
in
fairness
to
participate
in
the
disgrace
of
his
detention
in
my
humble
judgment
the
greatest
fault
he
ever
committed
was
in
having
too
good
an
opinion
of
the
justice
of
the
boroughmongers
and
relying
upon
the
liberality
of
their
agents
so
far
as
to
be
betrayed
into
that
net
which
now
surrounds
him
he
always
appeared
to
admire
our
courts
of
justice
but
he
knew
nothing
of
our
system
of
packing
special
juries
in
the
progress
of
this
work
i
shall
give
a
brief
delineation
of
the
political
movements
of
the
last
twelve
or
fourteen
years
or
at
least
of
those
events
that
came
within
my
knowledge
which
i
believe
will
include
almost
every
thing
relating
to
reform
and
the
public
characters
who
have
taken
any
part
in
promoting
or
retarding
that
desirable
object
these
public
characters
consist
of
george
the
third

many
curious
and
interesting
anecdotes
facts
intrigues

which
were
never

presented
to

and
which
circumstances
together
with
the
secret
springs
and
actions
of
those
who
worked
in
the
back
ground
which
have
hitherto
been
very
imperfectly
understood
shall
be
brought
to
light
and
faithfully
recorded
taking
due
care
not
to
betray
any
confidential
communications
i
shall
also
as
is
usual
or
at
least
as
is
very
common
give
a
short
sketch
of
my
ancestors
not
because
i
can
show
a
long
line
of
them
up
to
the
conquest
nor
because
i
esteem
this
a
circumstance
to
boast
of
but
i
shall
state
facts
as
they
have
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
by
old
family
documents
regardless
of
the
sneers
of
those
who
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
very
same
breath
in
which
they
affect
to
ridicule
and
despise
all
distinctions
of
this
sort
fall
themselves
into
a
much
greater
error
and
indulge
in
a
much
less
excusable
folly
that
of
holding
up
to
public
admiration
esteem
and
confidence
their
own
offspring
and
bedaubing
them
with
the
most
fulsome
adulation
merely
because
they
are
their
own
progeny
although
every
other
person
except
themselves
can
clearly
perceive
that
they
neither
possess
talent
intellect
public
spirit
nor
any
other
qualification
calculated
either
to
amuse
or
to
instruct
when
i
see
a
sensible
man
in
other
respects
fall
into
an
inconsistency
of
this
sort
i
am
always
reminded
of
the
fable
of
the
the
owl
and
her
young
the
fact
is
that
i
am
more
proud
of
my
father
than
of
any
of
my
ancestors
because
i
know
him
to
have
been
an
excellent
and
an
honest
man
and
one
who
by
his
industry
and
talent
became
a
second
founder
of
his
family
but
as
the
object
of
my
labours
will
be
to
give
you
a
faithful
history
of
my
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
either
to
you
or
me
whether
i
ever
had
a
grand
father
or
not
except
as
far
as
relates
to
the
coincidence
of
the
events
of
the
present
time
with
those
which
occurred
in
the
reigns
of
charles
the
first
and
second
and
during
the
protectorship
of
cromwell
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
remind
you
that
the
brave
and
enlightened
patriot
was
imprisoned
at
dunster
castle
in
by
the
tyrant
charles
the
first
prynne
had
his
nose
slit
and
his
ears
cut
off
for
speaking
and
writing
his
mind
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
he
lived
to
see
the
head
struck
and
the
who
passed
the
upon
him
brought
to
a
and
exemplary
in
the
confident
hope
that
we
shall
live
to
see
better
days
our
country
restored
to
prosperity
and
its
inhabitants
to
freedom
and
happiness
i
remain
my
friends
and
your
faithful
and
sincere
humble
servant
hunt
memoirs
of
henry
hunt
i
was
born
at
widdington
farm
in
the
parish
of
upavon
in
the
county
of
wilts
on
the
day
of
and
am
descended
from
as
ancient
and
respectable
a
family
as
any
in
that
county
my
forefather
having
arrived
in
england
with
and
attended
william
the
conqueror
as
a
colonel
in
that
army
with
which
he
successfully
invaded
this
country
he
became
possessed
of
very
considerable
estates
in
the
counties
of
wilts
and
somerset
which
passed
from
father
to
son
down
to
the
period
of
the
civil
wars
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
first
when
in
consequence
of
the
tyrannical
government
of
that
weak
and
wicked
prince
became
a
and
at
length
after
having
by
the
means
of
judges
and
packed
not
only
amerced
and
incarcerated
but
caused
to
be
executed
many
of
the
wisest
bravest
and
most
patriotic
men
of
the
age
the
tyrant
was
ultimately
brought
to
justice
and
forfeited
his
head
upon
a
scaffold
having
first
been
compelled
to
sign
the
death
warrant
for
his
favourite
lord
strafford
when
the
commonwealth
was
established
and
cromwell
declared
lord
protector
my
great
great
grandfather
colonel
thomas
hunt
who
was
in
possession
of
those
estates
in
wiltshire
unfortunately
took
a
decided
and
prominent
part
in
favour
of
charles
the
second
who
had
fled
and
was
then
remaining
in
france
waiting
an
opportunity
for
his
restoration
and
instigating
those
who
were
known
to
be
his
partisans
in
this
country
to
resist
and
overthrow
the
and
constitution
of
the
country
as
then
by
law
charles
was
in
constant
correspondence
with
my
forefather
colonel
hunt
who
together
with
grove
and
penruddock
were
all
country
gentlemen
of
large
property
and
considerable
influence
residing
in
the
county
of
wilts
and
avowed
royalists
firmly
attached
to
the
family
of
stuart
and
as
it
was
well
known
by
cromwell
that
charles
had
a
number
of
powerful
partisans
in
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
he
took
good
care
to
have
all
their
motions
well
watched
and
as
he
kept
a
host
of
spies
in
his
employ
they
found
it
next
to
impossible
to
form
or
arrange
any
general
plan
of
without
its
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
his
agents
many
schemes
had
been
detected
and
frustrated
by
these
watchful
minions
of
the
protector
but
the
royalists
were
not
to
be
deterred
from
their
purpose
although
many
of
them
received
intimation
from
oliver
that
he
was
aware
of
all
their
plans
and
intentions
he
resting
satisfied
with
this
knowledge
and
the
conviction
that
he
not
only
kept
their
restless
spirits
in
check
but
that
he
was
at
all
times
prepared
to
put
them
down
with
a
high
hand
in
case
they
should
ever
dare
to
break
out
into
open
violence
or
attempt
to
put
their
intentions
into
execution
however
as
hunt
grove
and
penruddock
with
many
other
friends
in
the
west
became
very
impatient
it
was
agreed
to
attempt
a
general
communication
by
means
of
a
meeting
of
the
disaffected
at
a
great
stag
hunt
which
was
announced
to
be
about
to
take
place
somewhere
in
the
forest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
wokingham
between
reading
and
windsor
to
this
stag
hunt
all
the
known
partisans
of
the
house
of
stuart
were
invited
and
when
assembled
there
in
great
numbers
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
it
was
agreed
among
them
that
each
man
should
raise
a
force
agreeable
to
his
means
some
horse
and
some
foot
by
a
particular
day
in
order
to
attack
the
troops
of
cromwell
who
was
a
great
deal
too
wary
and
cunning
to
suffer
such
an
extraordinary
assembly
under
any
circumstances
and
particularly
of
such
suspicious
persons
as
those
who
attended
the
hunt
were
known
to
be
without
sending
some
of
his
agents
to
join
them
whereby
he
might
become
acquainted
with
whatever
project
they
might
have
in
contemplation
they
all
departed
after
the
hunt
was
over
having
fixed
to
be
ready
and
join
in
the
field
by
a
particular
day
cromwell
agents
did
their
duty
and
he
was
no
sooner
informed
of
the
plan
which
was
laid
than
he
made
all
due
preparation
for
meeting
any
force
that
might
be
brought
into
the
field
against
him
by
these
powerful
malcontents
he
not
only
did
this
but
he
employed
his
agents
to
win
over
some
of
the
most
formidable
of
his
adversaries
by
bribes
and
promises
having
succeeded
in
this
he
wrote
to
all
the
remaining
conspirators
and
informed
them
separately
that
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
all
their
plots
and
of
their
intention
to
bring
a
force
into
the
field
against
him
on
a
particular
day
he
assured
them
that
he
had
made
all
necessary
preparations
not
only
to
meet
and
to
defeat
them
with
an
overwhelming
force
of
troops
but
that
he
had
also
made
friends
of
some
of
those
on
whom
the
conspirators
placed
their
greatest
reliance
he
concluded
by
saying
that
as
their
project
would
be
sure
to
end
in
discomfiture
ruin
and
disgrace
he
advised
them
to
abandon
their
plan
altogether
and
in
that
case
he
promised
each
of
the
parties
his
pardon
and
that
it
should
be
taken
no
further
notice
of
this
had
the
desired
effect
with
most
of
the
numerous
partisans
of
charles
who
had
pledged
themselves
to
take
the
field
for
when
they
found
that
all
their
plans
had
come
to
the
knowledge
of
cromwell
they
anticipated
that
he
would
be
prepared
to
meet
them
with
such
a
force
as
it
would
not
be
prudent
in
them
to
encounter
and
as
prudence
is
the
better
part
of
valour
they
at
once
abandoned
their
intended
insurrection
and
trusted
to
the
clemency
of
him
whom
they
had
resolved
to
hurl
from
the
eminence
which
they
professed
to
say
he
had
usurped
not
so
with
the
three
wiltshire
royalists
they
also
had
received
the
circular
intimation
from
cromwell
but
they
scorned
to
be
worse
than
their
words
they
took
no
notice
of
his
proffered
pardon
they
each
raised
a
troop
of
horse
as
they
had
promised
and
having
armed
and
accoutred
their
men
by
the
time
appointed
they
marched
into
salisbury
where
cromwell
judges
were
then
holding
the
assizes
and
without
any
further
ceremony
struck
the
first
blow
by
consigning
the
lord
protector
judges
to
prison
having
liberated
the
prisoners
they
were
about
to
try
the
next
day
they
marched
into
hampshire
towards
the
appointed
rendezvous
as
had
been
previously
agreed
upon
but
when
they
arrived
there
instead
of
meeting
as
they
expected
any
of
their
friends
who
were
parties
at
the
stag
hunt
they
found
cromwell
army
who
had
intimation
of
their
movements
already
there
in
considerable
force
ready
to
overwhelm
them
however
cromwell
as
usual
endeavoured
to
carry
his
point
by
policy
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
sacrifice
any
lives
in
such
an
unequal
conflict
he
sent
a
flag
of
truce
and
promised
if
they
would
lay
down
their
arms
they
should
be
pardoned
and
all
officers
and
men
might
return
to
their
homes
without
any
molestation
a
consultation
and
council
of
war
was
held
when
grove
hunt
and
penruddock
came
to
a
determination
to
die
sword
in
hand
rather
than
trust
to
the
clemency
of
him
whom
they
deemed
an
usurper
and
they
returned
an
answer
accordingly
in
the
meantime
oliver
had
sent
some
of
his
agents
amongst
the
men
to
whom
they
pointed
out
the
desperate
situation
in
which
their
commanders
had
placed
them
and
urged
them
at
once
to
accept
the
offer
of
the
protector
and
return
to
their
homes
and
when
grove
hunt
and
penruddock
ordered
their
men
to
prepare
for
the
attack
they
one
and
all
refused
and
immediately
lay
down
their
arms
upon
which
they
were
instantly
surrounded
and
made
prisoners
and
instead
of
cromwell
keeping
his
word
with
these
poor
fellows
he
ordered
every
common
man
to
be
instantly
hung
upon
the
boughs
of
trees
and
elsewhere
and
the
officers
to
be
committed
to
three
separate
jails
in
the
west
of
england
upon
a
charge
of
high
treason
for
making
war
against
the
troops
of
the
commonwealth
in
order
to
depose
the
protector
and
with
an
intent
to
alter
the
government
and
constitution
of
the
country
as
by
the
then
law
established
upon
which
charge
they
were
tried
found
guilty
and
sentenced
by
the
very
judges
whom
they
had
before
imprisoned
at
salisbury
to
be
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
but
upon
petition
their
sentence
was
mitigated
by
cromwell
to
that
of
being
beheaded
colonel
hunt
was
sent
back
after
trial
to
be
executed
at
this
very
jail
and
possibly
might
have
been
confined
if
not
in
the
same
room
upon
the
very
same
spot
wherein
his
descendant
is
now
writing
the
account
of
the
transaction
which
has
descended
by
tradition
and
written
documents
to
him
as
the
heir
of
the
family
and
which
written
documents
in
proof
thereof
are
now
in
his
possession
however
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
therein
recorded
that
two
sisters
elizabeth
and
margery
came
to
visit
him
the
night
previous
to
his
execution
which
was
ordered
to
take
place
at
the
next
morning
the
regulations
of
the
jail
not
being
so
strictly
performed
as
they
are
now
his
sister
margery
slept
in
his
bed
all
night
while
the
colonel
who
had
dressed
himself
in
her
clothes
walked
out
of
the
prison
unperceived
with
his
sister
elizabeth
and
escaped
but
as
it
is
recorded
by
himself
being
a
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
and
fearful
of
keeping
in
the
he
had
lost
himself
in
the
night
and
had
wandered
about
so
that
when
arrived
he
had
not
got
so
far
from
the
jail
but
that
he
heard
the
bell
toll
for
his
execution
at
this
awful
period
he
met
a
collier
carrying
a
bag
of
coals
upon
his
horse
and
having
ascertained
by
some
conversation
that
he
had
with
him
that
he
was
friendly
to
the
cause
of
the
stuarts
and
hostile
to
the
protector
he
was
induced
to
discover
himself
and
to
place
his
person
and
his
life
in
his
power
of
which
he
had
no
reason
to
repent
as
the
man
proved
faithful
and
assisted
him
to
escape
to
france
where
he
remained
with
the
second
charles
and
returned
in
company
with
him
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
as
the
circumstances
attending
his
escape
are
in
my
opinion
very
interesting
i
shall
give
them
as
they
have
been
handed
down
to
me
although
they
may
be
by
some
considered
as
tedious
in
the
detail
yet
as
they
are
circumstances
very
imperfectly
recorded
only
in
the
early
editions
of
lord
clarendon
history
of
the
rebellion
and
as
they
relate
to
events
somewhat
similar
to
the
present
times
wherein
a
prominent
part
was
taken
by
one
of
my
forefathers
i
trust
that
they
will
not
be
esteemed
superfluous
as
making
a
component
part
of
my
memoirs
in
reference
to
the
political
part
taken
by
one
of
my
family
at
this
important
epoch
of
the
english
history
the
collier
took
him
up
behind
on
his
horse
dressed
as
he
was
in
female
attire
and
having
struck
across
the
country
by
some
private
roads
he
arrived
at
his
habitation
a
lone
cottage
situated
on
the
side
of
a
large
common
where
he
remained
concealed
anxiously
awaiting
the
approach
of
night
and
dreading
every
moment
the
appearance
of
the
officers
of
justice
in
pursuit
of
their
victim
in
the
mean
time
the
collier
had
procured
two
muskets
and
a
blunderbuss
which
he
had
got
loaded
determined
to
stand
by
the
colonel
who
if
driven
to
extremities
was
resolved
to
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
possible
but
not
to
be
taken
again
alive
but
to
return
to
the
jail
when
the
officers
of
death
arrived
to
unbolt
the
door
of
the
intended
victim
what
must
have
been
their
surprise
and
indignation
to
have
found
in
his
bed
a
woman
a
brave
and
patriotic
female
who
gloried
in
having
saved
the
life
of
a
high
spirited
and
beloved
brother
with
what
delight
have
we
read
of
the
conduct
of
madame
lavalette
who
saved
her
husband
from
an
untimely
death
by
similar
means
who
by
her
virtuous
devotion
rescued
the
victim
marked
out
for
the
treacherous
revenge
of
a
weak
wicked
and
pusillanimous
prince
with
what
pleasure
has
every
humane
and
patriotic
bosom
been
roused
into
admiration
at
the
noble
generous
and
successful
exertions
of
sir
wilson
and
his
friends
to
assist
in
snatching
the
life
of
that
devoted
victim
from
the
bloody
hand
of
the
executioner
but
many
brave
men
have
voluntarily
sacrificed
themselves
to
save
the
life
of
a
friend
in
the
pages
of
history
we
find
that
many
an
excellent
wife
has
done
the
same
to
save
a
beloved
husband
but
where
shall
we
find
a
similar
instance
of
disinterested
devotion
in
a
sister
to
be
the
descendant
of
such
a
woman
to
bear
the
same
name
and
belong
to
her
family
is
in
itself
something
that
i
am
proud
to
boast
of
with
what
delight
have
i
while
yet
a
boy
listened
to
this
recital
while
my
father
dwelt
on
it
with
rapture
his
eye
glistening
with
a
dignified
pride
as
he
recounted
the
tale
of
this
heroine
of
the
family
how
often
have
i
been
sent
up
stairs
to
unlock
the
old
oak
chest
and
to
bring
down
the
musty
records
of
these
eventful
days
that
they
might
be
unrolled
either
to
refresh
my
father
memory
or
to
vouch
for
particular
acts
and
circumstances
how
many
times
subsequently
has
it
been
my
lot
to
turn
to
this
or
that
particular
event
and
while
he
enjoyed
his
pipe
how
often
did
i
at
his
command
read
the
minute
detail
as
i
found
it
written
upon
the
old
musty
parchments
and
papers
however
to
proceed
colonel
desbrow
who
then
had
the
command
of
oliver
troops
at
this
place
was
instantly
informed
of
the
flight
of
the
prisoner
he
ordered
margery
to
appear
before
him
which
she
did
habited
in
her
brother
clothes
and
he
threatened
to
have
her
executed
instantly
without
judge
or
jury
in
her
brother
stead
if
she
did
not
immediately
inform
him
of
the
whole
plot
and
assist
in
the
of
her
brother
she
calmly
replied
that
she
had
not
the
least
objection
to
comply
with
his
demand
as
far
as
she
knew
of
the
plot
she
confessed
that
she
went
into
the
prison
to
visit
her
brother
with
the
intention
to
effect
his
escape
if
possible
that
neither
her
brother
nor
even
her
sister
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
her
intentions
till
she
proposed
it
to
him
in
the
prison
that
there
she
found
him
resigned
to
his
fate
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
she
at
last
prevailed
upon
him
to
put
it
into
practice
that
all
she
knew
of
him
was
that
he
had
left
the
room
with
her
sister
elizabeth
but
which
way
or
where
he
was
gone
she
knew
nothing
then
with
great
and
dignified
firmness
she
added
even
if
she
had
known
any
thing
of
his
route
colonel
desbrow
must
be
aware
that
as
she
had
the
courage
and
goodness
to
plan
and
effect
his
escape
no
threats
not
even
the
torture
should
induce
her
to
do
any
thing
that
might
place
him
in
their
power
again
elizabeth
was
instantly
taken
into
custody
and
examined
also
but
she
knew
nothing
more
than
her
sister
they
were
both
consigned
to
the
dungeon
that
he
had
quitted
and
the
scaffold
although
it
remained
fixed
for
some
days
it
mourned
for
the
loss
of
its
victim
and
the
gaping
multitude
daily
stared
in
vain
for
the
consummation
of
the
bloody
sacrifice
desbrow
sent
off
dispatches
to
the
government
raised
a
hue
and
cry
to
search
every
house
they
came
to
and
dispatched
messengers
to
all
the
so
that
neither
pains
expense
nor
trouble
were
spared
to
retake
the
fugitive
in
the
mean
time
the
sentence
of
grove
and
penruddock
was
put
in
execution
they
were
both
beheaded
on
the
same
morning
one
at
exeter
and
the
other
at
some
other
jail
it
is
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
of
circumstances
that
at
the
time
myself
the
lineal
heir
and
descendant
of
colonel
hunt
am
confined
in
this
jail
by
the
state
policy
of
the
day
colonel
desbrow
the
lineal
descendant
of
the
very
colonel
desbrow
who
then
had
the
command
of
this
district
as
a
soldier
and
servant
of
cromwell
is
at
this
very
time
an
officer
in
the
service
of
the
present
reigning
family
and
i
believe
an
attendant
about
the
person
of
the
sovereign
colonel
hunt
remained
concealed
in
the
cottage
of
his
protector
but
when
night
came
they
were
too
agitated
to
retire
to
rest
they
therefore
barricadoed
the
door
of
their
little
fortress
as
well
as
they
could
and
having
put
out
the
lights
took
their
station
at
the
window
each
with
a
loaded
firelock
and
all
the
arms
and
ammunition
they
could
muster
for
preparatory
to
the
best
and
most
determined
defence
in
case
of
necessity
in
this
they
were
ably
and
resolutely
assisted
by
the
wife
of
the
collier
both
of
whom
are
recorded
to
have
evinced
the
most
heroic
courage
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
upon
this
to
them
desperate
and
trying
occasion
which
qualities
were
soon
put
to
the
test
by
the
sudden
and
boisterous
arrival
of
the
consisting
of
or
mounted
troops
accompanied
by
an
officer
belonging
to
the
sheriff
as
that
which
followed
relating
to
this
rencontre
is
described
minutely
and
in
the
most
simple
manner
i
will
give
it
as
i
find
it
recorded
in
the
family
document
from
which
i
have
taken
the
whole
narrative
colonel
hunt
and
the
collier
were
standing
at
the
window
each
with
a
loaded
musket
the
collier
wife
stood
behind
with
a
loaded
blunderbuss
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
she
was
to
supply
the
powder
and
slugs
for
they
had
no
ball
for
reloading
they
were
in
this
order
when
the
commander
of
the
gang
loudly
halloed
and
demanded
admittance
this
as
was
agreed
upon
by
the
party
within
was
repeated
three
times
before
any
answer
was
given
or
any
movement
made
from
within
at
length
the
collier
opened
the
casement
of
the
thatched
cottage
and
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
just
awoke
out
of
his
first
sleep
he
exclaimed
in
the
broad
somersetshire
dialect
thow
want
makin
such
a
naise
there
the
reply
was
we
want
admittance
we
are
the
hue
and
cry
come
to
search
every
house
for
a
prisoner
that
has
escaped
from
ilchester
jail
in
woman
clothes
at
which
the
collier
exclaimed
ha
ha
ha
what
a
pack
of
fools
to
come
to
look
for
a
man
in
woman
clothes
at
this
time
o
the
night
the
officer
with
a
stern
voice
demanded
immediate
admittance
saying
that
they
had
a
warrant
signed
by
colonel
desbrow
for
searching
every
house
and
that
unless
he
came
down
and
opened
the
door
they
would
force
their
way
in
immediately
upon
which
the
collier
turned
round
and
said
as
if
speaking
to
his
wife
come
dame
you
must
get
up
and
strike
a
light
and
we
will
let
the
gentlemen
in
presently
there
was
then
some
pretended
delay
in
finding
the
and
at
length
the
collier
began
striking
the
steel
with
the
flint
and
after
bestowing
a
few
curses
on
the
dampness
of
the
tinder
intentionally
struck
down
the
tinderbox
tinder
and
all
upon
which
he
said
there
now
they
must
come
in
and
search
in
the
dark
all
this
time
they
were
actually
preparing
to
fire
upon
the
hue
and
cry
and
just
as
they
had
taken
aim
and
were
upon
the
point
of
drawing
their
triggers
the
captain
of
the
gang
gave
the
collier
two
or
three
heavy
curses
and
said
to
his
men
come
let
us
be
off
to
some
more
likely
place
there
is
nobody
here
but
that
stupid
fellow
that
does
not
appear
to
know
his
right
hand
from
his
left
they
therefore
galloped
off
to
search
the
next
house
leaving
to
colonel
hunt
and
his
faithful
friends
in
adversity
the
uninterrupted
possession
of
his
safe
and
secure
retreat
where
he
remained
concealed
till
in
the
disguise
of
some
of
the
collier
clothes
he
contrived
soon
afterwards
to
escape
to
france
accompanied
by
his
friend
he
was
received
by
charles
with
open
arms
with
every
demonstration
of
gratitude
and
professions
of
future
reward
in
case
he
should
succeed
in
himself
upon
the
throne
of
england
in
the
meanwhile
cromwell
enraged
at
the
escape
of
one
who
had
discovered
such
intrepid
and
persevering
hostility
to
his
power
confiscated
the
whole
of
his
estates
kept
his
sisters
elizabeth
and
margery
close
prisoners
in
this
jail
and
frequently
threatened
to
execute
the
latter
unless
hunt
would
return
from
france
and
surrender
himself
to
his
fate
this
reaching
the
ears
of
colonel
hunt
in
france
and
fearing
for
the
safety
of
such
excellent
sisters
he
at
length
resolved
to
return
and
rescue
them
from
their
unpleasant
and
precarious
situation
by
resigning
himself
into
the
hands
of
charles
remonstrated
in
vain
as
hunt
appeared
resolute
in
his
determination
the
prince
therefore
put
him
under
arrest
and
forcibly
detained
him
in
custody
to
prevent
him
from
surrendering
himself
his
two
sisters
were
confined
when
they
were
set
at
liberty
charles
released
him
from
his
confinement
he
remained
in
constant
attendance
about
his
person
returned
with
him
in
the
same
vessel
and
assisted
in
his
restoration
to
the
throne
which
had
been
withheld
from
him
during
the
life
of
cromwell
colonel
hunt
as
well
as
all
his
friends
expected
the
immediate
restoration
of
his
estates
which
had
been
confiscated
in
fact
no
one
could
have
expected
less
than
this
act
of
justice
at
least
in
return
for
his
long
zealous
and
faithful
services
but
on
the
contrary
the
secret
advisers
of
the
grateful
prince
recommended
to
him
by
all
means
to
endeavour
to
conciliate
his
enemies
and
to
let
his
friends
shift
for
themselves
which
advice
he
followed
to
the
letter
in
this
instance
as
colonel
hunt
estates
had
fallen
into
powerful
hands
charles
absolutely
refused
to
take
any
measures
for
their
restoration
thus
was
this
faithful
partisan
of
royalty
rewarded
for
all
his
services
by
one
of
the
basest
acts
of
ingratitude
that
ever
disgraced
the
character
even
of
a
prince
how
truly
verified
was
the
prophetic
and
sublime
admonition
of
scripture
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
however
colonel
hunt
was
offered
the
chancellorship
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
for
life
which
offer
he
indignantly
refused
and
in
disgust
retired
into
the
country
where
he
married
and
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
tranquillity
accompanied
by
his
sisters
upon
a
small
estate
in
the
parish
of
enford
in
the
county
of
wilts
which
had
been
overlooked
by
the
agents
of
cromwell
here
with
the
property
he
had
with
his
lady
and
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
he
sustained
the
character
of
a
gentleman
to
a
good
old
age
leaving
an
only
son
to
whom
queen
anne
gave
the
colonelcy
of
a
regiment
of
foot
this
was
the
last
of
my
family
who
was
ever
in
the
employment
of
the
government
or
who
ever
received
one
shilling
of
the
public
money
in
any
capacity
whatever
this
little
estate
descended
to
my
grandfather
who
married
miss
biggs
of
stockton
and
at
his
death
it
came
considerably
encumbered
to
my
father
in
the
year
the
year
after
i
was
born
finding
during
the
life
time
of
his
father
that
this
was
a
very
poor
property
to
live
upon
as
a
gentleman
he
turned
his
mind
to
business
and
to
the
improvement
of
his
fortune
he
married
at
the
age
of
to
miss
powell
who
was
only
nineteen
the
eldest
daughter
of
a
respectable
farmer
of
week
near
devizes
and
went
to
live
at
widdington
in
the
parish
of
upavon
a
lone
farm
situated
upon
salisbury
plain
not
within
one
mile
of
any
other
house
whatever
the
day
of
november
gave
birth
to
the
author
of
these
memoirs
and
as
i
was
the
first
born
my
father
having
a
great
deal
of
the
old
family
pride
about
him
the
event
was
commemorated
in
a
very
memorable
and
extraordinary
manner
it
was
the
custom
of
the
country
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
a
child
by
inviting
the
friends
and
neighbours
to
partake
of
a
feast
which
consisted
of
toast
well
baked
sliced
in
layers
in
a
large
bowl
interspersed
with
sugar
and
nutmeg
well
soaked
in
boiling
ale
or
what
was
called
in
that
country
good
old
october
my
father
as
soon
as
he
was
about
to
marry
anticipating
the
natural
result
prepared
and
provided
two
hogsheads
of
real
stingo
for
the
occasion
it
being
brewed
exactly
fifteen
bushels
to
the
hogshead
which
he
liberally
determined
should
be
devoted
to
celebrate
the
happy
event
which
was
literally
carried
into
effect
i
have
very
often
heard
those
who
were
present
and
who
participated
in
the
good
cheer
and
rejoicing
mention
these
circumstances
it
was
usual
in
that
part
of
the
country
upon
these
occasions
to
have
a
day
fixed
and
set
apart
for
the
feast
when
all
the
neighbours
were
invited
to
partake
and
drink
to
the
health
of
the
good
lady
in
the
straw
and
long
life
to
the
little
stranger
but
upon
this
occasion
my
father
set
no
bounds
to
his
joy
and
determined
to
keep
it
up
which
he
did
till
the
whole
to
the
last
hoop
of
the
stingo
was
gone
i
have
heard
the
nurse
say
that
she
toasted
bread
from
morning
till
night
for
a
fortnight
and
that
in
the
whole
there
could
not
have
been
less
bread
used
than
what
was
made
from
two
bags
of
flour
the
of
november
was
annually
celebrated
as
long
as
my
father
lived
by
a
dinner
which
he
gave
to
his
neighbours
and
friends
and
one
thing
was
never
forgotten
which
was
a
bumper
toast
to
the
memory
of
colonel
thomas
and
miss
margery
hunt
which
generally
concluded
by
the
production
of
the
sword
which
charles
the
second
took
from
his
side
and
presented
to
the
colonel
on
his
arrival
in
france
which
my
father
with
great
pride
exhibited
to
his
friends
frequently
accompanied
by
some
part
of
the
foregoing
narrative
my
mother
was
of
a
weak
and
nervous
constitution
and
i
inherited
in
some
degree
when
a
child
her
complaint
for
i
was
very
delicate
although
remarkable
for
activity
and
high
spirits
i
remember
about
a
month
before
i
first
went
to
school
which
was
at
the
early
age
of
only
five
years
and
a
half
i
rode
to
fair
near
winchester
a
distance
of
miles
and
back
again
the
same
day
with
my
father
to
ride
miles
in
one
day
for
a
boy
not
five
years
and
a
half
old
which
i
did
without
any
apparent
fatigue
was
considered
rather
an
extraordinary
omen
of
my
future
capability
for
active
exertion
i
was
sent
to
a
at
tilshead
in
wiltshire
at
five
and
a
half
years
of
age
and
my
father
told
me
at
my
departure
that
i
was
going
to
begin
a
little
world
for
myself
before
i
mounted
my
poney
he
seriously
gave
me
his
blessing
and
his
parting
advice
which
was
delivered
in
a
very
emphatic
manner
my
mother
anxiously
listening
while
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eye
go
said
he
my
dear
and
may
heaven
bless
and
direct
all
your
actions
so
that
you
may
grow
up
to
be
an
honest
a
brave
and
a
good
man
but
remember
well
what
i
now
say
you
must
fight
your
own
battles
amongst
your
schoolfellows
as
well
as
you
can
if
i
ever
hear
that
you
are
quarrelsome
i
shall
detest
you
but
if
i
find
that
you
are
a
coward
i
will
disown
and
disinherit
you
this
was
the
language
of
one
of
the
best
of
fathers
to
his
son
a
child
of
five
years
and
a
half
old
and
it
speaks
volumes
as
to
the
character
of
the
man
and
the
parent
this
school
which
was
situated
in
a
healthy
village
upon
salisbury
plain
consisted
of
a
master
and
an
usher
who
had
the
care
and
instruction
of
boys
the
scholars
were
better
fed
than
taught
but
as
a
healthy
situation
was
more
looked
to
than
their
education
by
the
parents
of
those
children
who
were
sent
there
the
discipline
was
calculated
to
give
general
satisfaction
we
learned
to
read
the
bible
to
write
and
cast
accounts
and
at
the
end
of
one
year
i
was
taken
from
this
school
beyond
the
events
incident
to
an
early
initiation
into
the
tricks
and
frolics
of
a
there
occurred
during
my
stay
at
this
place
nothing
worthy
of
being
introduced
here
with
the
exception
however
of
one
very
important
circumstance
relative
to
the
strict
discipline
maintained
by
my
father
in
all
cases
where
there
was
the
slightest
deviation
from
truth
a
violation
of
truth
was
always
sure
to
be
punished
by
him
with
the
greatest
severity
as
the
circumstance
to
which
i
allude
made
a
strong
and
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
and
in
a
great
measure
laid
the
foundation
for
my
general
rule
of
action
ever
since
i
shall
faithfully
record
it
during
the
year
that
i
was
at
tilshead
i
came
home
for
the
midsummer
holidays
on
the
last
thursday
before
i
returned
i
accompanied
my
father
to
devizes
market
and
while
he
was
taking
his
dinner
and
selling
his
corn
i
was
directed
to
go
to
week
about
half
a
mile
distant
to
dine
with
and
see
my
grandfather
i
set
off
to
walk
thither
but
on
my
road
there
was
a
number
of
persons
collected
on
the
green
seeing
some
soldiers
fire
at
a
target
the
firing
was
kept
up
in
rapid
succession
i
felt
alarmed
and
was
fearful
of
passing
them
i
therefore
returned
into
the
town
and
having
passed
the
time
away
in
play
with
some
boys
that
i
met
i
returned
to
my
father
at
the
inn
and
answered
the
questions
that
he
put
to
me
relative
to
my
grandfather
so
as
to
make
him
believe
that
i
had
been
there
as
he
desired
me
being
to
confess
the
truth
that
i
was
afraid
to
pass
the
soldiers
on
the
following
monday
i
went
to
school
again
without
thinking
any
more
of
the
falsehood
that
i
had
been
guilty
of
however
about
six
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
friday
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
my
father
ride
up
to
the
door
of
the
i
ran
to
meet
him
but
he
received
me
rather
coolly
which
i
scarcely
perceived
but
he
asked
to
see
cooper
my
master
who
came
out
and
invited
him
to
get
off
his
horse
which
he
declined
and
said
that
i
might
ride
a
little
way
with
him
on
his
road
home
if
my
master
had
no
objection
and
i
could
walk
back
which
was
readily
assented
to
all
this
was
done
with
a
dignified
calmness
which
i
did
not
comprehend
however
as
i
rode
along
seated
before
him
he
began
to
question
me
as
to
the
truth
of
some
transactions
that
had
passed
during
the
holidays
and
at
length
came
to
the
visit
to
my
grandfather
the
whole
fabrication
flashed
across
my
mind
at
once
and
the
mighty
secret
of
all
his
apparent
solemnity
had
such
an
effect
upon
my
nerves
that
i
should
i
am
sure
have
fallen
from
the
horse
if
he
had
not
held
me
on
at
length
after
i
had
confessed
the
whole
truth
which
he
did
not
appear
to
believe
he
broke
out
into
the
following
exclamation
you
have
been
guilty
of
an
abominable
falsehood
and
you
have
now
as
is
always
the
case
told
me
another
artful
lie
in
order
to
screen
yourself
from
the
punishment
which
you
deserve
and
to
give
you
which
i
have
ridden
over
here
eight
miles
on
purpose
your
conduct
has
almost
broken
your
afflicted
mother
heart
and
has
rendered
me
completely
miserable
i
would
rather
follow
you
to
the
grave
than
live
to
see
you
bearing
the
character
of
a
liar
and
i
will
now
nearly
half
kill
you
for
your
infamous
behaviour
upon
which
he
lifted
me
off
by
the
side
of
the
road
on
the
down
no
person
being
within
hearing
or
sight
and
having
alighted
and
tied
his
horse
to
a
bush
all
remonstrance
and
intreaties
on
my
part
proved
in
vain
he
made
me
strip
off
my
coat
and
with
a
smart
stick
he
gave
me
a
most
severe
flogging
as
he
helped
me
on
with
my
coat
and
sent
me
back
to
school
i
saw
the
big
tear
trickle
down
his
noble
manly
cheek
a
convincing
proof
to
me
even
at
that
time
that
he
suffered
much
more
in
performing
such
a
painful
duty
to
save
a
child
from
disgrace
than
i
did
in
receiving
such
a
severe
though
chastisement
although
i
thought
the
punishment
very
harsh
at
the
time
yet
i
felt
conscious
that
i
deserved
it
and
he
performed
the
task
in
such
a
manner
as
convinced
me
of
its
justice
and
the
more
i
reflected
upon
it
the
more
i
was
satisfied
that
it
arose
from
the
greatest
parental
affection
it
made
the
most
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
and
stamped
my
determination
at
all
hazards
to
speak
the
truth
in
future
the
kindness
of
my
father
and
mother
was
such
that
they
never
mentioned
the
subject
afterwards
till
i
was
grown
up
to
manhood
and
thanked
him
for
it
it
was
a
severe
but
excellent
lesson
for
me
and
i
have
always
found
that
as
honesty
is
the
best
policy
so
is
truth
in
the
end
always
sure
to
prevail
although
i
know
i
am
sent
here
for
speaking
boldly
and
publicly
the
and
for
always
under
every
circumstance
acting
up
to
its
lovely
and
substantial
precepts
yet
i
never
felt
more
grateful
than
i
do
at
this
moment
to
my
excellent
and
father
for
inculcating
the
principle
of
always
speaking
the
truth
notwithstanding
that
i
am
suffering
for
practising
it
he
used
to
say
nothing
could
be
more
dangerous
than
the
doctrine
so
frequently
promulgated
that
the
truth
should
not
be
spoken
at
all
times
thus
leaving
it
to
be
inferred
that
falsehood
was
sometimes
justifiable
although
he
added
there
are
times
when
it
may
be
prudent
for
a
man
not
to
speak
at
all
yet
when
he
does
speak
nothing
but
a
coward
would
hesitate
to
speak
boldly
the
truth
this
was
the
language
of
that
man
to
whom
i
owe
my
existence
and
from
whom
i
imbibed
at
a
very
early
age
those
principles
of
veracity
justice
humanity
and
public
spirit
the
free
exercise
of
which
although
it
consigned
his
forefather
as
well
as
his
descendant
to
the
prison
yet
such
is
the
consoling
and
effect
of
following
the
dictates
of
an
honest
mind
that
it
not
only
tranquillizes
the
passions
and
checks
their
overflowing
the
due
bounds
of
discretion
while
under
the
influence
of
prosperity
but
also
conveys
to
the
persecuted
captive
that
inward
satisfaction
which
makes
reflection
even
in
a
prison
a
source
of
delight
and
teaches
him
to
despise
that
outward
shew
of
mirth
and
affected
gaiety
which
accompany
the
selfish
votaries
of
pleasure
who
sacrifice
every
honest
independent
principle
at
the
shrine
of
fashion
till
the
man
is
degraded
to
a
mere
pander
in
the
temple
of
folly
when
i
left
this
school
cooper
the
master
came
round
during
the
holidays
as
was
customary
to
collect
his
bills
my
father
having
settled
the
amount
and
invited
him
to
dine
informed
him
of
his
intention
to
remove
me
to
hursley
in
hampshire
which
he
did
at
the
recommendation
of
sir
thomas
heathcot
whom
he
had
met
at
wyndham
at
dinton
of
whom
my
father
rented
widdington
farm
cooper
who
was
one
of
the
best
hearted
and
worthy
men
that
perhaps
ever
lived
and
who
possessed
as
little
of
the
pedantry
and
stiffness
of
a
schoolmaster
as
any
man
who
had
spent
his
life
in
such
an
occupation
replied
that
he
was
very
sorry
to
part
with
me
as
he
had
no
doubt
i
should
some
day
make
as
clever
and
he
hoped
as
good
a
man
as
my
father
the
only
fault
in
me
of
which
he
had
to
complain
was
that
i
was
too
volatile
and
inattentive
to
my
books
but
he
added
that
he
could
already
discover
sufficient
capacity
to
enable
me
with
a
little
steadiness
to
become
a
very
good
scholar
then
addressing
himself
particularly
to
my
mother
he
said
that
he
was
bound
in
justice
to
declare
that
he
had
not
a
more
tractable
or
boy
in
his
school
that
i
was
a
generous
and
lad
and
that
my
would
be
sorry
to
hear
that
i
was
going
to
leave
them
he
spent
the
day
with
my
father
and
mother
and
in
the
most
benignant
and
manner
recounted
some
of
the
idle
boyish
tricks
and
frolicks
that
he
had
detected
me
in
assuring
them
at
the
same
time
that
i
had
been
punished
only
during
my
stay
with
him
and
that
was
for
a
venial
offence
which
was
committed
out
of
school
hours
young
as
i
was
being
under
seven
years
of
age
when
i
left
this
school
i
nevertheless
formed
connections
and
attachments
which
have
existed
to
this
hour
with
unabated
sincerity
and
uninterrupted
friendship
and
as
a
gratifying
proof
of
this
fact
one
of
my
then
school
fellows
thomas
cousens
of
heytesbury
with
whom
i
have
ever
since
that
period
been
on
the
most
friendly
footing
was
the
very
first
person
who
came
to
visit
me
after
my
arrival
at
this
prison
he
no
sooner
heard
of
my
sentence
than
he
mounted
his
horse
and
before
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
look
round
my
new
habitation
the
name
of
my
friend
cousens
was
announced
who
had
ridden
upwards
of
thirty
miles
and
in
the
true
spirit
of
disinterested
genuine
friendship
proffered
not
only
his
hand
but
his
heart
to
serve
me
in
any
way
that
lay
in
his
power
i
have
indeed
received
innumerable
proofs
of
kindness
and
sympathy
from
various
quarters
of
the
empire
since
my
arrival
here
but
the
recollection
of
this
prompt
and
efficient
testimony
of
the
sincerity
of
his
friendship
will
only
be
forgotten
by
me
in
the
grave
upon
the
death
of
my
grandfather
at
this
period
my
father
went
to
reside
at
littlecot
farm
in
the
parish
of
enford
but
he
still
occupied
widdington
farm
having
spent
two
or
three
days
by
invitation
with
his
landlord
wyndham
of
dinton
where
he
met
sir
thomas
heathcot
of
hursley
park
who
was
the
brother
of
wyndham
he
was
prevailed
upon
by
the
joint
intercession
of
sir
thomas
and
as
well
as
wyndham
to
send
me
to
be
educated
at
hursley
where
sir
thomas
was
patronising
in
a
school
a
very
worthy
man
of
the
name
of
alner
the
brother
of
alner
of
salisbury
who
for
so
many
years
had
the
conducting
and
arranging
the
materials
which
composed
the
western
almanack
and
wyndham
had
also
promised
to
send
their
three
eldest
sons
at
the
same
time
to
the
same
school
and
one
or
two
sons
of
wyndham
of
salisbury
were
also
going
there
and
the
worthy
baronet
who
never
did
a
kind
action
by
halves
promised
my
father
who
was
a
great
favourite
with
him
that
he
would
take
the
same
care
of
me
and
shew
me
the
same
attention
that
he
did
to
his
nephews
which
promise
he
did
not
forget
to
perform
during
my
stay
at
hursley
school
which
was
about
two
years
and
a
half
alner
was
a
remarkably
good
penman
and
accountant
as
well
as
a
great
proficient
in
teaching
the
use
of
the
globes
here
i
became
an
adept
in
writing
arithmetic
and
geography
which
were
the
principal
things
to
be
learned
at
that
school
during
my
stay
there
i
was
in
the
frequent
habit
of
spending
the
sunday
with
the
young
wyndham
at
hursley
park
and
as
often
as
my
father
came
to
see
me
the
old
baronet
insisted
upon
his
making
the
lodge
his
home
kindness
generosity
and
hospitality
welcomed
every
visitor
to
hursley
lodge
during
the
life
of
sir
thomas
in
fact
his
philanthropy
was
such
that
it
not
only
extended
to
his
own
tenants
but
to
his
tenants
and
to
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
perhaps
there
never
were
two
country
gentlemen
who
did
greater
credit
to
the
character
of
genuine
old
english
hospitality
than
the
then
owners
of
hursley
lodge
in
hampshire
and
dinton
house
in
wiltshire
my
old
the
present
proprietor
of
dinton
still
keeps
up
the
character
of
an
hospitable
english
country
gentleman
but
alas
hursley
lodge
since
the
death
of
old
sir
thomas
but
as
i
can
not
say
any
thing
favourable
either
from
my
own
knowledge
or
from
the
report
of
others
i
will
content
myself
with
saying
nothing
i
left
this
school
at
the
age
of
ten
years
during
the
holidays
i
had
frequent
means
of
seeing
and
now
first
began
to
reflect
and
make
my
observations
upon
the
situation
of
the
labouring
poor
of
the
parish
of
enford
for
my
mother
devoted
a
very
great
portion
of
her
time
to
relieving
the
wants
of
those
who
either
through
illness
or
accident
stood
in
need
of
assistance
and
although
she
was
herself
in
a
very
weakly
state
of
health
yet
neither
inclemency
of
the
weather
nor
the
distance
ever
deterred
her
from
going
in
person
to
visit
to
comfort
and
to
assist
those
of
her
who
were
in
distress
it
was
quite
enough
for
her
to
know
that
any
of
her
poor
neighbours
were
in
want
to
command
her
immediate
aid
how
often
when
she
was
about
to
relieve
some
one
whom
they
supposed
to
be
an
unworthy
object
who
had
brought
want
on
his
own
head
by
misconduct
or
crime
have
i
heard
even
my
father
as
well
as
other
friends
endeavour
in
vain
to
persuade
her
that
her
indiscriminate
charity
did
almost
as
much
harm
as
good
her
answer
always
was
having
first
quoted
some
amiable
christian
precept
would
you
leave
them
to
starve
and
thus
drive
them
to
despair
they
are
in
want
of
bread
and
after
i
have
relieved
them
from
their
present
distress
i
shall
have
some
claim
to
their
attention
and
by
setting
them
a
christian
i
shall
be
the
better
enabled
to
enforce
the
mild
and
wholesome
doctrines
of
religion
surely
i
shall
have
a
much
better
chance
of
reforming
and
reclaiming
them
by
the
of
than
i
should
have
by
treating
them
with
neglect
or
casting
on
them
the
chilling
and
forbidding
look
of
harshness
and
here
let
me
observe
that
if
there
ever
was
a
human
being
who
acted
up
to
the
spirit
and
letter
of
christianity
both
in
profession
and
practice
i
believe
my
excellent
departed
mother
to
have
been
that
mortal
her
greatest
pleasure
consisted
in
doing
good
and
to
pour
the
healing
balm
of
comfort
into
the
wounded
and
afflicted
breast
was
to
her
the
very
essence
of
delight
surrounded
by
every
comfort
herself
her
very
existence
appeared
to
depend
upon
her
power
to
make
others
participate
in
those
comforts
no
living
creature
in
distress
was
ever
turned
away
from
her
door
without
being
relieved
i
could
fill
a
volume
in
her
praise
without
being
able
to
do
her
common
justice
i
was
now
become
of
sufficient
age
to
be
at
once
a
companion
and
an
assistant
in
these
charitable
peregrinations
there
was
not
a
threshold
in
the
village
but
she
had
crossed
at
one
time
or
another
in
order
to
render
some
act
of
kindness
or
attention
and
as
she
passed
along
the
grateful
inhabitants
of
every
cottage
came
forth
to
bestow
upon
her
their
spontaneous
and
fervent
blessings
whilst
those
who
were
rolling
in
wealth
and
puffed
up
with
pride
were
suffered
to
pass
unheeded
by
here
it
was
that
my
little
heart
first
began
to
pant
for
the
power
to
do
good
and
i
longed
to
receive
and
to
deserve
such
blessings
as
were
lavished
with
grateful
lips
upon
my
angelic
mother
by
the
poor
of
all
denominations
i
now
began
to
pity
their
wants
and
sufferings
and
to
participate
and
rejoice
in
their
happiness
when
i
expressed
a
desire
for
riches
to
enable
me
to
purchase
such
blessings
as
were
bestowed
upon
her
how
often
did
my
beloved
mother
reprove
me
in
the
kindest
manner
and
endeavour
to
impress
upon
my
young
mind
this
valuable
truth
that
wealth
did
not
always
afford
the
best
means
of
doing
good
she
used
to
say
that
those
who
sincerely
wished
to
do
an
act
of
charity
seldom
wanted
the
means
of
doing
something
to
relieve
the
wants
and
soothe
the
afflictions
of
those
who
were
pining
in
wretchedness
and
want
for
said
she
even
a
kind
consoling
word
combined
with
a
very
little
personal
attention
is
frequently
esteemed
more
valuable
and
even
proved
to
be
more
useful
than
money
to
those
whose
spirits
as
well
as
bodies
are
pressed
down
to
the
earth
by
unforeseen
and
frequently
unmerited
misfortune
these
examples
opened
to
my
susceptible
mind
a
new
field
for
reflection
and
the
scenes
of
misery
i
witnessed
although
at
that
period
they
were
not
numerous
and
required
to
be
sought
for
to
be
known
yet
they
created
a
sympathy
in
my
young
breast
which
i
flatter
myself
i
have
ever
cherished
and
from
that
period
i
may
date
the
origin
of
my
philanthropy
my
mother
saw
the
impression
which
it
had
made
upon
the
mind
of
her
son
and
having
kindled
the
sacred
fire
of
benevolence
she
took
good
care
to
fan
the
flame
by
giving
me
the
means
of
exercising
those
charitable
feelings
which
she
had
by
her
example
created
added
to
these
as
well
as
all
the
other
moral
virtues
this
excellent
woman
practised
the
most
pious
and
scrupulous
attention
to
her
religious
duties
her
motto
was
teach
me
to
feel
another
woe
to
hide
the
fault
i
see
that
mercy
i
to
others
shew
that
mercy
shew
to
me
while
my
mother
was
instilling
into
my
mind
and
teaching
me
to
practice
the
mild
and
lowly
principles
of
christianity
my
father
never
failed
to
hold
up
for
my
admiration
and
example
the
exploits
of
the
noble
generous
brave
and
renowned
heroes
of
antiquity
pope
was
his
favourite
author
and
of
all
pope
works
his
universal
prayer
and
his
translation
of
homer
were
the
theme
of
his
and
unqualified
panegyric
the
former
he
never
failed
to
repeat
aloud
night
and
morning
in
the
most
fervent
and
impassioned
manner
he
made
me
learn
it
and
recommended
me
to
follow
his
example
by
making
it
the
daily
expression
of
my
praise
and
adoration
of
the
allwise
and
supreme
disposer
of
events
he
could
repeat
every
line
of
the
iliad
and
what
was
more
remarkable
he
could
begin
at
any
one
line
and
proceed
with
the
greatest
fluency
and
correctness
even
to
the
end
of
any
chapter
or
book
in
short
he
endeavoured
to
instil
into
my
breast
the
principle
of
disinterested
love
of
although
he
was
himself
a
man
of
business
and
of
the
world
he
never
failed
to
hold
up
for
my
example
those
heroes
who
had
lived
and
died
alone
for
their
country
hector
was
his
favourite
warrior
and
he
appeared
to
have
obtained
the
dearest
wish
of
his
heart
when
coming
into
my
room
by
accident
one
day
he
found
me
reading
aloud
and
repeating
the
speech
of
hector
to
andromache
i
was
taken
by
surprise
and
laid
down
the
book
but
he
entreated
me
to
continue
the
subject
and
to
oblige
him
i
began
the
dialogue
again
and
he
repeated
the
part
of
andromache
although
heretofore
a
very
shy
boy
i
now
became
warm
and
at
length
impassioned
he
encouraged
me
and
before
we
had
concluded
i
almost
fancied
myself
a
hero
he
was
delighted
he
took
me
in
his
arms
he
embraced
and
caressed
me
he
saw
that
i
had
caught
the
he
wept
over
me
with
rapture
and
he
exclaimed
aloud
in
a
sort
of
frantic
extacy
the
name
of
hunt
will
again
be
recorded
in
the
page
of
history
and
i
feel
that
you
my
dear
boy
are
destined
to
restore
the
fame
of
our
family
and
i
hope
to
live
to
see
you
prove
yourself
worthy
of
your
ancestors
this
brought
into
the
room
my
mother
who
was
struck
with
astonishment
at
the
unusual
manner
of
my
father
he
repeated
to
her
that
be
had
he
thought
discovered
in
me
such
seeds
as
would
grow
up
and
produce
fruit
of
future
fame
she
smiled
in
the
most
benignant
manner
and
said
he
must
trust
to
time
to
realize
such
hopes
but
at
all
events
she
could
answer
for
one
thing
which
was
that
the
seeds
of
humanity
and
philanthropy
were
implanted
in
my
breast
for
she
had
hailed
with
great
satisfaction
the
proof
that
i
could
feel
for
others
and
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
relieve
the
wants
and
sufferings
of
my
fellow
creatures
and
therefore
she
fondly
hoped
that
i
should
make
a
good
man
and
a
good
christian
and
addressing
herself
to
my
father
she
added
we
will
my
dear
trust
to
chance
whether
he
ever
makes
a
hero
or
not
i
mention
these
particular
incidents
to
shew
what
pains
were
taken
by
my
excellent
father
and
my
amiable
and
affectionate
mother
to
instil
into
my
young
mind
those
precepts
which
each
conceived
would
be
most
conducive
to
my
future
happiness
my
fathers
great
object
appeared
to
be
to
fire
the
young
aspiring
hope
with
deeds
of
honour
courage
and
patriotism
my
mother
more
gentle
nature
induced
her
to
cultivate
the
genial
soil
with
the
milder
virtues
making
christian
piety
and
charity
the
foundation
of
all
her
present
and
future
hopes
there
never
lived
a
child
that
had
more
pains
and
care
bestowed
upon
him
by
his
parents
than
i
had
my
father
inherited
and
practised
the
noblest
qualities
he
was
an
intelligent
industrious
strictly
honest
honourable
englishman
the
motto
taken
from
his
favourite
author
was
constantly
upon
his
lips
an
honest
man
is
the
noblest
work
of
god
my
mother
may
be
correctly
described
in
one
short
sentence
to
have
been
a
gentle
virtuous
amiable
charitable
and
truly
pious
christian
having
now
left
the
school
at
hursley
where
i
had
learned
all
that
could
be
learned
there
my
father
received
from
alner
the
worthy
master
very
similar
assurances
to
those
he
had
previously
received
from
cooper
that
i
was
a
generous
volatile
lad
capable
of
learning
any
thing
that
i
chose
to
apply
myself
to
but
that
i
was
rather
more
fond
of
excelling
in
feats
of
activity
than
of
a
strict
adherence
to
my
studies
i
was
now
sent
to
the
grammar
school
at
andover
under
the
care
of
the
rev
thomas
griffith
where
i
was
to
enter
upon
the
study
of
the
classics
my
father
took
me
on
a
saturday
that
being
a
at
andover
and
having
introduced
me
to
and
griffith
he
did
not
forget
to
give
me
the
character
he
had
received
from
the
masters
of
the
two
schools
which
i
had
previously
left
adding
his
own
testimony
in
confirmation
of
my
being
of
a
kind
generous
and
open
disposition
griffith
received
us
very
politely
and
as
she
had
a
very
prepossessing
manner
i
felt
pleased
with
the
prospect
before
me
although
i
thought
i
saw
something
that
i
did
not
much
like
in
the
countenance
of
griffith
who
was
a
muscular
swarthy
person
with
rather
a
forbidding
air
my
father
having
given
me
his
blessing
took
his
leave
and
consigned
me
to
my
new
master
who
led
me
into
the
school
and
as
it
was
then
past
eleven
he
gave
me
an
enfield
speaker
and
desired
me
to
look
it
over
as
he
should
not
place
me
in
any
class
until
monday
the
school
hours
were
up
at
twelve
saturday
afternoon
being
always
a
holiday
and
consequently
i
did
not
consider
that
i
had
any
task
to
learn
on
that
day
i
was
therefore
more
employed
in
thinking
of
my
mother
at
home
and
in
looking
round
the
school
surveying
my
new
companions
than
i
was
with
the
volume
at
length
i
caught
my
master
eye
and
as
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
as
i
thought
at
me
i
returned
it
as
an
earnest
of
my
sense
of
his
kindness
but
alas
as
it
will
appear
i
mistook
my
man
he
beckoned
to
me
and
called
me
up
to
his
desk
at
the
other
end
of
the
school
i
obeyed
pray
sir
said
he
what
were
you
laughing
at
i
found
i
was
deceived
and
i
stood
silent
unable
to
answer
the
interrogatory
upon
which
he
gave
me
a
severe
box
under
the
ear
which
made
me
reel
again
and
nearly
knocked
me
down
he
then
sternly
said
go
sir
to
your
seat
and
mind
your
business
and
in
future
take
care
how
you
let
me
catch
you
laughing
again
this
at
once
impressed
upon
my
mind
the
ferocity
and
cowardice
of
his
nature
for
i
had
not
been
in
the
school
at
the
time
more
than
ten
minutes
it
was
such
an
act
of
injustice
cruelty
and
tyranny
and
so
very
different
from
any
thing
that
i
had
ever
before
experienced
that
i
was
almost
stupified
with
indignation
but
recovering
myself
a
little
i
was
upon
the
point
of
rushing
out
of
the
school
and
flying
to
my
father
who
must
have
been
yet
at
the
inn
in
the
town
i
looked
towards
the
door
it
stood
enticingly
open
and
if
my
pride
had
not
come
to
my
assistance
i
should
most
assuredly
have
indulged
the
first
impulse
of
my
resentment
from
that
moment
to
this
however
i
have
never
thought
of
the
circumstance
without
regretting
that
i
did
not
follow
that
impulse
however
i
sat
down
but
from
that
time
i
never
failed
to
consider
him
as
an
unjust
and
cruel
petty
tyrant
nor
did
i
ever
for
one
moment
afterward
look
up
to
him
even
with
common
respect
i
continued
at
this
place
for
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
during
which
time
in
common
with
many
of
my
i
had
to
endure
the
cruel
unnecessary
and
wanton
punishments
indiscriminately
inflicted
by
this
modern
dionysius
i
soon
became
hardened
and
set
all
controul
at
defiance
and
instead
of
my
pride
being
hurt
or
being
ashamed
of
punishment
it
became
a
boast
and
a
pride
to
brave
it
and
to
bear
it
with
indifference
and
contempt
this
monster
in
human
form
would
come
into
the
school
and
flog
half
a
dozen
boys
before
he
sat
down
under
some
pretence
or
other
either
that
he
had
heard
some
noise
in
their
bedroom
the
night
before
or
that
they
had
not
washed
their
hands
clean
nay
he
sometimes
flogged
a
boy
without
ever
telling
him
what
it
was
for
and
frequently
while
his
hand
was
in
he
would
gnashing
his
large
white
teeth
which
looked
white
from
the
same
cause
that
a
teeth
look
so
merely
because
they
were
such
a
great
contrast
to
his
black
visage
he
would
dart
his
eye
round
the
different
classes
to
see
which
boy
he
should
fix
upon
as
his
next
victim
during
these
disgusting
periods
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
favourites
every
one
heart
palpitated
within
his
agitated
breast
when
this
vindictive
mania
was
upon
him
myself
and
three
or
four
other
boys
were
almost
certain
to
come
in
for
a
share
in
fact
when
his
eye
came
to
my
class
i
would
almost
involuntarily
lay
down
my
book
and
meet
his
horrid
gaze
as
if
prepared
to
receive
a
beckon
from
him
to
come
out
if
he
passed
me
over
which
was
very
seldom
it
was
considered
as
a
miracle
frequently
while
he
was
punishing
me
and
while
the
blood
was
running
almost
in
streams
from
my
lacerated
back
i
have
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
and
i
could
fancy
i
saw
him
enjoying
the
same
sort
of
savage
ferocious
delight
that
a
hungry
wolf
would
discover
in
gorging
upon
the
mangled
vitals
of
the
unoffending
lamb
such
is
the
effect
which
tyranny
produces
upon
the
noble
mind
that
although
i
was
of
a
tender
delicate
frame
and
rather
of
a
timid
nature
yet
i
soon
became
so
inured
to
punishment
that
i
constantly
bore
the
most
severe
flogging
without
altering
a
muscle
of
my
face
notwithstanding
i
frequently
received
from
ten
to
twenty
lashes
from
the
recently
made
instrument
of
torture
which
was
composed
of
new
each
stroke
from
which
drew
the
blood
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
after
i
had
left
the
room
to
get
some
other
boy
to
pick
out
the
spills
which
were
left
sticking
in
my
lacerated
flesh
some
of
them
more
than
half
an
inch
long
nay
at
last
it
became
so
bad
that
one
of
the
washerwomen
made
a
serious
complaint
to
griffith
about
the
horrid
state
of
my
linen
griffith
expostulations
were
in
vain
although
they
were
made
in
the
most
urgent
and
pressing
manner
in
my
hearing
i
speak
of
myself
here
but
there
were
several
other
boys
who
were
punished
equally
without
justice
and
without
mercy
as
well
as
myself
to
recite
particular
acts
of
this
sort
would
be
as
disgusting
as
they
would
be
tedious
and
uninteresting
but
there
was
a
nice
lad
of
the
name
of
george
blandford
that
he
had
literally
flogged
into
a
he
had
whipped
every
power
of
learning
out
of
him
and
then
he
whipped
him
daily
because
he
could
not
learn
at
length
his
elder
brother
who
slept
in
the
same
room
with
me
planned
their
escape
from
the
school
i
went
down
stairs
with
them
very
early
one
morning
and
having
let
them
out
i
locked
the
doors
again
and
returned
to
my
bed
without
being
detected
griffith
however
called
me
up
to
his
desk
and
having
charged
me
with
having
assisted
in
their
escape
i
boldly
admitted
the
fact
rather
than
tell
a
lie
upon
which
i
received
a
most
severe
flogging
before
he
set
off
to
reclaim
the
fugitives
the
blandfords
escaped
all
pursuit
and
reached
their
home
and
fortunately
for
them
their
parents
never
suffered
them
to
return
as
for
myself
he
continued
to
flog
and
i
continued
to
set
him
at
defiance
one
more
act
of
his
extreme
injustice
i
will
relate
to
shew
how
unfit
he
was
to
have
the
care
of
children
and
as
a
caution
to
parents
not
to
place
them
in
the
power
of
such
men
particularly
under
the
care
of
such
clergymen
who
while
they
practise
every
species
of
injustice
and
upon
their
pupils
contrive
to
escape
detection
by
covering
their
real
character
with
the
garb
of
religion
and
thus
hide
the
most
atrocious
acts
under
the
cloak
of
their
hypocritical
sanctity
immediately
before
the
holidays
there
was
a
prize
to
be
written
for
which
prize
was
a
handsome
the
rev
hugh
stevens
a
gentleman
in
every
respect
exactly
the
reverse
of
griffith
was
the
principal
assistant
and
who
always
decided
which
was
the
best
written
piece
and
he
at
once
declared
that
i
was
the
winner
griffith
who
had
never
before
interfered
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
was
enraged
that
i
should
be
successful
in
spite
of
his
malignant
exertions
always
to
put
me
back
and
he
insisted
upon
it
that
a
boy
of
the
name
of
butcher
had
written
his
piece
better
than
mine
and
that
he
should
have
the
prize
stevens
felt
indignant
at
this
barefaced
act
of
partiality
and
gross
injustice
and
would
not
be
come
a
party
to
it
after
having
expostulated
some
time
in
vain
he
handed
me
over
the
prize
upon
his
own
responsibility
in
the
presence
of
the
enraged
parson
and
desired
griffith
if
he
wished
to
favour
butcher
to
do
it
by
giving
him
a
knife
out
of
his
own
pocket
which
he
actually
did
in
order
to
sneak
out
of
the
business
by
these
repeated
acts
of
injustice
and
cruelty
he
however
soon
lost
his
school
another
boy
griffith
own
nephew
whose
name
was
bradley
now
ran
away
for
setting
a
hollow
tree
on
fire
in
the
public
parade
called
the
acre
to
shew
what
acts
of
tyranny
and
oppression
will
drive
even
a
lad
to
do
in
the
way
of
hardened
resistance
observe
the
following
instance
seventeen
of
the
boys
were
to
be
flogged
for
making
a
bonfire
on
the
of
november
myself
of
course
among
the
number
many
of
them
were
large
boys
and
we
were
left
together
while
griffith
was
busily
employed
making
up
a
number
of
rods
out
of
half
a
dozen
new
birch
brooms
a
great
many
dozens
of
which
he
bought
every
year
at
weyhill
fair
expressly
for
that
purpose
while
he
was
thus
amiably
occupied
although
i
was
one
of
the
smallest
and
youngest
among
them
i
volunteered
to
recommend
forcible
resistance
and
proposed
if
they
would
all
stick
together
that
when
he
came
into
the
school
we
would
seize
him
lay
him
down
tie
him
hand
and
foot
and
give
him
a
good
flogging
instead
of
taking
the
flogging
ourselves
and
i
believe
that
i
went
so
far
as
to
offer
to
become
myself
the
operator
this
was
listened
to
for
a
moment
but
such
is
the
effect
of
tyranny
upon
the
human
mind
that
the
majority
were
for
remaining
passive
slaves
and
accordingly
we
all
patiently
suffered
him
to
flog
us
one
after
the
other
when
it
came
to
my
turn
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
received
any
punishment
with
a
hardened
indifference
which
enraged
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
gave
me
a
double
dose
declaring
at
one
time
as
he
gnashed
his
teeth
that
he
would
flog
me
till
i
did
cry
out
in
spite
of
his
threat
however
he
became
tired
first
for
i
believe
i
should
have
expired
under
his
bloody
hand
before
i
would
have
uttered
a
single
sigh
or
a
groan
i
must
do
my
the
justice
to
say
that
the
whole
seventeen
acted
in
the
same
manner
not
one
of
them
gratified
his
tender
ear
with
a
shriek
a
groan
or
even
a
complaint
our
play
ground
was
the
church
yard
at
the
back
of
the
school
a
very
improper
place
indeed
for
boys
to
amuse
themselves
in
as
it
was
covered
with
graves
and
tomb
and
head
stones
over
which
it
was
our
occupation
to
be
constantly
jumping
the
churchwardens
complained
to
griffith
of
the
injury
done
to
the
graves
by
our
jumping
on
them
and
griffith
tyrant
like
always
ready
to
curtail
any
indulgence
and
liberty
we
had
however
previously
limited
it
might
be
instead
of
appropriating
a
fresh
play
ground
to
our
use
threatened
to
punish
any
boy
who
was
found
jumping
over
the
tomb
stones
or
upon
the
graves
and
prohibited
almost
every
species
of
amusement
that
we
had
hitherto
enjoyed
a
consultation
was
held
and
it
was
agreed
in
order
to
be
revenged
upon
the
churchwardens
that
we
would
all
meet
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
or
rather
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
and
that
every
one
should
throw
a
stone
into
the
chancel
window
when
the
time
arrived
this
was
performed
and
i
believe
myself
and
some
half
dozen
more
remained
while
the
rest
were
scampering
off
and
had
a
second
throw
although
the
first
did
ample
execution
and
made
a
tremendous
crash
particularly
at
that
still
hour
of
the
night
the
noise
brought
all
the
neighbours
out
of
their
houses
who
perceived
us
flying
but
we
all
escaped
and
got
into
the
school
without
the
detection
of
any
one
in
particular
however
as
it
was
known
that
some
of
the
boys
had
done
this
we
were
all
told
by
griffith
the
next
day
that
unless
we
gave
up
the
boy
or
boys
who
did
it
to
be
flogged
he
would
not
grant
a
holiday
the
whole
half
year
and
he
only
gave
us
till
two
in
the
afternoon
to
consider
of
what
he
had
said
during
the
play
hours
between
twelve
and
two
the
whole
time
was
occupied
in
devising
expedients
how
to
avert
this
dreadful
denunciation
which
was
to
deprive
us
of
our
usual
holidays
at
length
it
was
declared
that
all
expedients
were
in
vain
and
that
unless
some
one
would
undertake
to
bear
the
brunt
and
sacrifice
himself
for
the
they
must
all
submit
to
be
incarcerated
within
the
walls
of
the
school
the
whole
without
any
recreation
whatever
one
of
the
largest
boys
said
if
any
one
would
volunteer
to
do
this
the
others
would
not
only
with
gratitude
subscribe
the
sum
required
to
pay
for
mending
the
window
but
would
also
subscribe
a
handsome
sum
as
a
reward
for
him
who
would
undertake
to
receive
the
punishment
after
this
speech
silence
reigned
around
for
a
time
but
all
eyes
were
soon
fixed
upon
me
with
a
sort
of
anxious
supplicating
hope
i
stepped
forward
with
a
determined
air
i
was
hailed
with
a
general
cheer
and
i
soon
realized
their
hopes
by
boldly
saying
that
i
would
take
the
flogging
although
it
must
and
would
no
doubt
be
a
very
severe
one
provided
that
they
would
subscribe
to
pay
for
mending
the
window
but
that
i
scorned
to
receive
any
thing
more
for
myself
than
the
reward
of
their
good
opinion
and
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
generous
sacrifice
of
myself
in
order
to
relieve
the
whole
of
my
school
fellows
from
a
dilemma
which
was
in
no
other
way
to
be
overcome
i
was
cheered
and
caressed
and
was
led
back
to
the
school
a
sort
of
willing
captive
and
surrendered
up
to
the
vengeance
of
the
master
as
the
culprit
who
had
been
guilty
of
a
crime
very
little
short
of
and
bordering
upon
sacrilege
two
or
three
of
the
boys
came
forward
and
stated
that
they
had
been
eye
witnesses
of
the
transaction
and
had
seen
me
break
the
window
by
throwing
repeatedly
at
it
with
a
hatful
of
stones
although
griffith
knew
this
to
be
a
falsehood
as
it
was
ascertained
that
it
was
done
at
one
smash
by
all
the
boys
yet
he
received
the
communication
with
a
savage
delight
and
having
put
on
one
of
his
usual
a
ghastly
he
ordered
me
to
prepare
for
the
punishment
due
to
my
temerity
the
very
boy
who
had
proposed
the
measure
was
selected
to
take
me
on
his
back
to
hold
me
while
i
received
the
flogging
which
was
inflicted
with
such
savage
cruelty
and
extended
to
such
a
length
of
time
that
with
some
difficulty
i
was
by
being
led
into
the
air
prevented
from
fainting
now
the
result
after
coming
out
of
the
school
i
was
i
own
extolled
by
some
and
caressed
by
others
but
many
laughed
at
my
folly
behind
my
back
some
even
taunted
me
at
times
with
having
broken
the
church
windows
but
from
first
to
last
they
never
subscribed
towards
paying
for
the
window
and
i
was
left
to
do
it
myself
which
was
accomplished
by
my
week
allowance
being
stopped
for
the
whole
and
the
remainder
was
placed
to
my
account
and
sent
home
to
my
father
in
the
following
item
for
breaking
church
windows
and
to
this
very
day
i
bear
the
character
in
the
town
of
andover
of
being
the
person
who
when
a
boy
at
school
broke
the
church
windows
this
act
of
ingratitude
was
enough
to
have
broken
the
public
spirit
of
almost
any
one
but
myself
i
have
from
that
day
to
this
been
in
the
constant
habit
of
making
personal
and
pecuniary
sacrifices
for
the
but
human
nature
as
taken
in
the
mass
was
faithfully
imaged
even
in
a
school
and
i
can
safely
say
that
the
only
reward
which
i
have
ever
received
from
that
day
to
this
for
all
my
public
services
devotion
and
sacrifices
consists
in
the
substantial
reflection
that
i
have
never
had
any
selfish
sinister
motives
but
that
i
have
always
been
actuated
by
the
most
disinterested
philanthropy
and
inflexible
love
of
country
how
many
good
men
have
i
seen
even
in
my
own
time
stand
forward
the
zealous
advocates
of
the
people
rights
who
have
flitted
upon
the
public
stage
but
a
very
short
period
and
we
have
heard
no
more
of
them
what
is
the
cause
of
this
dereliction
the
inference
generally
is
that
all
mankind
are
alike
none
are
to
be
trusted
but
the
fact
is
this
many
really
disinterested
truly
patriotic
men
have
been
driven
from
off
the
field
by
the
infamous
slanders
of
the
corrupt
daily
press
many
of
them
were
men
who
would
have
faced
a
cannon
mouth
or
would
have
suffered
the
most
horrid
punishment
even
the
torture
rather
than
have
deserted
the
public
cause
but
they
were
incapable
of
bearing
up
against
the
malignant
slanders
base
assertions
and
foul
attacks
of
the
public
press
there
are
also
many
who
have
come
before
the
public
with
very
patriotic
feelings
and
who
have
at
the
same
time
calculated
upon
receiving
a
public
reward
at
any
rate
they
have
expected
to
be
saved
harmless
in
their
pockets
that
the
expence
of
any
public
exertion
would
at
least
be
repaid
by
those
who
surrounded
them
and
who
cheered
and
applauded
their
every
but
no
so
sure
as
a
man
entertains
any
notion
or
expectation
of
this
sort
so
sure
is
he
to
meet
with
cruel
disappointment
the
very
first
time
he
places
himself
in
a
situation
to
try
the
experiment
thus
otherwise
a
very
good
man
he
feels
at
once
disgusted
with
public
ingratitude
and
not
having
calculated
upon
such
conduct
and
not
perhaps
ever
having
tried
the
experiment
i
while
at
school
he
retires
with
scorn
and
indignation
from
public
life
or
he
turns
over
to
some
new
faction
in
place
or
power
who
have
both
the
means
and
inclination
to
reward
him
for
his
apostacy
to
proceed
with
the
narrative
griffith
did
every
thing
he
could
to
prevent
my
getting
on
in
my
studies
but
i
always
contrived
to
say
my
lesson
even
to
him
so
as
to
escape
punishment
and
out
of
all
the
floggings
i
got
at
this
school
i
was
never
once
punished
for
not
learning
my
task
indeed
when
i
had
to
say
my
lesson
to
stevens
i
did
it
with
ease
and
frequently
left
off
at
the
head
of
the
class
having
worked
my
way
up
during
examination
in
fact
when
i
said
my
lesson
to
stevens
i
left
off
at
the
head
or
top
of
the
class
but
when
i
said
it
to
griffith
i
was
sure
to
finish
at
the
after
having
endured
this
sort
of
discipline
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
griffith
one
evening
came
into
the
school
after
having
had
sport
in
as
if
to
wreak
that
vengeance
upon
the
boys
which
the
partridges
had
escaped
he
walked
up
the
school
throwing
his
eyes
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
to
seek
for
some
proper
objects
at
length
he
fixed
upon
a
boy
of
the
name
of
ludlow
and
having
ordered
him
to
prepare
for
a
flogging
ludlow
expostulated
and
demanded
to
know
what
he
had
done
to
justify
the
punishment
griffith
hesitated
and
assigned
some
trifling
reason
frivolous
even
had
it
not
been
unfounded
but
he
persisted
and
gave
ludlow
the
flogging
as
usual
he
called
me
up
and
upon
his
ordering
me
to
prepare
i
followed
the
example
of
ludlow
and
demanded
the
reason
he
gave
me
a
box
on
the
ear
and
told
me
he
would
inform
me
after
i
had
received
the
flogging
when
he
had
given
me
this
chastisement
as
usual
very
severely
he
said
now
sir
this
is
for
what
you
did
yesterday
and
i
will
flog
you
for
what
you
did
the
day
before
mentioning
at
the
same
time
some
trivial
circumstance
unless
you
should
do
something
in
the
meanwhile
to
deserve
it
thus
he
taught
me
to
look
forward
to
a
flogging
every
day
for
five
or
six
days
to
come
this
was
a
little
too
bad
to
live
in
anticipation
nay
of
a
certainty
of
being
flogged
every
day
for
the
next
week
and
i
consequently
determined
to
embrace
the
first
opportunity
of
taking
french
leave
i
communicated
my
intention
to
ludlow
who
slept
in
the
same
room
and
he
feeling
indignant
at
the
injustice
done
him
determined
to
accompany
me
the
next
day
being
a
half
holiday
i
was
to
be
confined
at
home
to
learn
some
lines
instead
of
going
out
to
walk
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
and
ludlow
having
agreed
to
sham
illness
in
the
morning
we
hoped
that
we
should
by
that
means
be
left
at
home
together
by
ourselves
and
if
a
fair
opportunity
offered
we
resolved
that
we
would
be
off
every
thing
turned
out
as
we
had
anticipated
ludlow
was
very
ill
and
griffith
who
was
a
very
humane
woman
made
him
lie
in
bed
where
he
was
nursed
with
tea
and
toast
and
other
nice
things
that
were
necessary
for
a
sick
person
about
three
all
the
other
boys
went
out
with
the
usher
to
take
their
after
noon
walk
i
was
left
at
home
and
ordered
to
remain
in
the
school
to
learn
a
very
hard
task
out
of
some
book
or
to
take
a
flogging
in
the
morning
i
went
immediately
up
stairs
to
inform
my
companion
that
the
coast
was
clear
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
put
on
his
cloaths
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
walked
down
stairs
out
of
the
back
door
across
the
church
yard
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
on
our
road
to
weyhill
leaving
griffith
to
take
her
patient
physic
herself
and
any
one
that
chose
to
learn
the
lines
that
the
parson
had
set
me
as
we
passed
along
we
saw
our
master
and
his
friend
shooting
in
a
field
adjoining
the
road
we
began
to
quake
for
fear
but
he
was
too
busily
engaged
with
his
sport
to
notice
us
and
creeping
along
under
the
hedge
we
passed
on
unnoticed
ludlow
parents
lived
at
devizes
a
distance
of
miles
from
andover
enford
the
residence
of
my
father
was
a
little
more
than
fifteen
miles
on
the
same
road
we
lost
no
time
and
having
kept
on
a
good
pace
we
arrived
at
enford
soon
after
six
this
was
some
time
in
october
and
it
was
quite
dark
before
we
got
within
sight
of
the
house
we
had
agreed
that
ludlow
should
sleep
with
me
and
proceed
on
to
his
own
house
the
next
morning
when
we
reached
the
door
my
heart
began
to
sink
within
me
and
i
was
actually
afraid
to
enter
for
now
i
began
to
dread
the
anger
of
my
father
which
was
much
more
terrible
to
me
than
the
tyranny
of
griffith
at
length
one
of
the
servants
james
jukes
came
by
and
i
begged
him
to
go
in
and
inform
my
father
of
my
being
come
home
he
told
me
that
my
father
was
from
home
but
he
hastened
in
for
the
purpose
of
informing
my
mother
this
however
was
not
necessary
for
we
followed
him
and
stood
before
my
mother
who
gave
a
shriek
of
astonishment
we
told
her
the
story
but
she
instantly
dispatched
the
servant
for
my
father
who
was
gone
to
visit
a
neighbour
ludlow
was
very
brave
upon
this
occasion
before
my
father
arrived
my
mother
had
given
us
a
supper
of
apple
pie
and
as
we
were
very
tired
and
as
i
wished
to
avoid
the
presence
of
my
father
as
long
as
i
could
we
requested
to
go
to
bed
but
my
mother
would
not
admit
of
this
till
he
was
come
home
at
length
the
well
known
knock
at
the
door
announced
his
approach
i
never
before
felt
such
a
sensation
of
fear
as
i
did
at
this
moment
he
came
in
and
having
sternly
surveyed
us
after
a
short
pause
he
said
pray
gentlemen
what
wind
brought
you
here
i
was
speechless
but
ludlow
boldly
replied
the
severity
of
our
master
sir
well
he
rejoined
and
my
severity
shall
flog
you
back
again
upon
which
we
were
immediately
packed
off
to
bed
which
my
mother
had
taken
care
to
provide
for
us
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
in
the
bed
room
ludlow
began
to
complain
of
the
injustice
of
my
father
adding
that
he
had
no
right
to
take
him
back
that
he
might
do
what
he
pleased
as
to
his
son
but
he
should
not
take
back
i
told
him
this
was
very
brave
talking
but
that
he
knew
nothing
of
my
father
if
he
expected
to
escape
either
by
blustering
or
reasoning
if
however
he
was
determined
to
proceed
home
i
would
do
any
thing
in
my
power
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
very
early
in
the
this
was
at
once
agreed
upon
to
be
attempted
at
all
events
we
lay
awake
till
day
break
when
he
got
up
having
put
on
his
cloaths
we
crept
down
stairs
very
quietly
and
i
unlocked
the
door
and
having
shaken
him
by
the
hand
and
wished
him
better
success
than
i
was
likely
to
meet
with
he
departed
for
devizes
i
returned
to
bed
and
being
called
up
in
the
morning
my
father
when
he
entered
the
breakfast
room
demanded
why
ludlow
did
not
get
up
i
told
him
the
truth
that
he
had
been
gone
for
four
hours
and
must
by
that
time
have
reached
his
own
home
my
father
made
no
reply
but
with
a
very
stern
look
he
left
the
room
as
i
afterwards
understood
from
my
mother
to
attend
a
at
updavon
where
he
had
engaged
to
meet
his
friend
and
landlord
wyndham
he
informed
that
gentlemen
of
the
circumstance
of
my
having
run
away
from
school
and
added
that
he
intended
to
take
me
back
early
in
the
morning
a
step
in
the
propriety
of
which
wyndham
heartily
concurred
however
in
the
course
of
the
day
a
messenger
came
with
a
letter
from
griffith
to
my
father
which
was
delivered
to
him
in
the
presence
of
his
landlord
the
letter
was
couched
in
the
most
coarse
and
unfeeling
language
he
charged
my
father
with
being
the
author
and
instigator
of
all
my
faults
and
accused
him
of
having
not
only
encouraged
me
in
disobeying
his
orders
but
also
of
conniving
at
my
running
away
from
the
this
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
for
me
and
the
only
thing
that
could
have
saved
me
from
being
taken
back
again
wyndham
told
my
father
that
nothing
on
earth
ought
to
prevail
upon
him
to
place
his
son
again
under
the
care
of
such
a
monster
and
they
now
both
became
just
as
determinedly
hostile
to
my
return
as
they
had
previously
been
agreed
that
i
ought
to
go
back
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
my
father
rode
over
to
andover
and
sent
for
griffith
down
to
the
star
inn
to
pay
him
his
bill
having
expostulated
with
him
upon
his
conduct
to
me
and
his
still
more
unfeeling
conduct
if
possible
to
himself
griffith
chose
to
bluster
and
bully
upon
which
my
father
coolly
turned
him
out
of
the
room
telling
him
that
his
gown
alone
saved
him
from
the
chastisement
that
he
merited
a
privilege
which
the
parson
did
not
choose
to
waive
he
therefore
sneaked
off
in
order
to
save
himself
from
being
either
kicked
or
ludlow
was
taken
back
to
the
school
by
his
father
and
having
subsequently
formed
connections
he
got
into
business
and
has
lived
in
the
own
of
andover
ever
since
within
two
years
of
this
time
griffith
school
dwindled
down
to
nothing
and
soon
afterwards
execrated
by
every
boy
that
had
ever
been
under
his
care
he
returned
to
wales
from
whence
he
came
in
detailing
these
occurrences
of
my
boyhood
i
have
been
thus
particular
for
two
purposes
first
to
shew
the
reader
the
tyranny
i
had
to
encounter
before
i
was
yet
thirteen
years
of
age
and
the
effect
it
produced
upon
my
mind
as
well
as
the
determined
manner
in
which
i
resisted
oppression
even
at
that
time
and
secondly
with
the
hope
that
it
will
be
a
warning
to
all
those
who
may
read
these
memoirs
to
avoid
sending
their
children
to
be
flogged
out
of
every
good
quality
and
rendered
miserable
without
the
least
chance
of
improvement
by
one
of
these
petty
tyrants
the
greatest
care
and
circumspection
should
be
exercised
by
parents
for
they
have
a
sacred
duty
to
perform
in
the
selection
of
those
with
whom
they
intrust
the
care
and
education
of
their
children
as
to
this
school
it
was
a
stain
upon
and
a
disgrace
to
the
character
of
english
education
in
scotland
such
a
school
would
not
have
existed
a
month
and
the
master
would
have
been
indicted
i
was
next
placed
under
the
care
of
the
rev
james
evans
who
kept
a
very
respectable
school
in
castle
street
at
salisbury
this
gentleman
was
also
a
welshman
and
as
i
had
taken
a
great
antipathy
to
reverend
welshmen
i
felt
rather
uncomfortable
when
i
ascertained
that
he
came
from
the
land
of
goats
my
fears
however
were
groundless
he
was
a
gentleman
in
every
respect
the
reverse
of
him
of
whom
i
have
so
recently
spoken
to
be
sure
he
was
pedantic
enough
having
been
all
his
life
a
but
he
was
a
humane
man
and
his
strictness
was
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
by
discipline
a
due
subordination
in
the
school
his
lady
evans
was
also
a
combination
of
good
qualities
and
i
believe
there
never
was
a
more
happy
couple
she
delighted
to
make
every
body
happy
about
her
as
for
myself
the
good
disposition
that
i
took
with
me
to
andover
was
in
a
great
measure
flogged
out
of
me
there
i
was
become
impatient
of
controul
and
had
imbibed
an
ungovernable
spirit
which
led
me
into
difficulties
and
disappointments
that
i
should
otherwise
have
avoided
i
have
often
lamented
the
trouble
that
i
gave
this
worthy
man
as
well
as
his
lady
and
many
years
back
thought
it
my
duty
to
take
an
occasion
of
expressing
the
sorrow
i
felt
for
any
uneasiness
that
i
had
caused
them
during
my
stay
there
the
life
which
i
led
here
was
a
life
of
pleasure
compared
to
that
which
i
led
at
the
place
i
had
quitted
and
although
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
recover
that
which
i
lost
at
andover
either
in
disposition
or
in
learning
yet
i
acquired
ten
times
more
real
knowledge
of
books
in
one
year
at
this
school
under
evans
than
i
did
at
andover
in
the
two
years
and
a
half
that
i
existed
there
i
remained
nearly
three
years
at
salisbury
at
the
end
of
which
time
i
was
become
a
pretty
good
latin
scholar
and
could
construe
virgil
and
horace
with
considerable
ease
to
myself
i
was
an
excellent
penman
and
a
pretty
good
mathematician
as
well
as
a
complete
master
of
mensuration
i
had
for
many
years
been
a
pupil
of
the
celebrated
goodall
and
as
i
was
acknowledged
by
him
to
have
arrived
at
a
great
degree
of
perfection
in
elegantly
tripping
it
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
he
frequently
took
me
to
exhibit
at
his
balls
both
in
salisbury
and
other
places
i
was
in
good
truth
excessively
fond
of
dancing
and
i
was
not
a
little
proud
at
one
of
the
race
balls
to
be
selected
by
goodall
who
was
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
stand
one
of
the
first
three
couple
with
the
prince
of
wales
my
partner
miss
mahon
to
enable
his
royal
highness
to
accomplish
the
figure
of
for
the
first
time
introduced
at
salisbury
by
his
royal
highness
i
will
relate
only
one
particular
occurrence
which
i
had
to
encounter
at
this
school
and
which
but
for
a
mere
accident
would
have
fixed
upon
my
character
an
indelible
stain
and
i
am
especially
induced
to
notice
it
by
the
circumstance
of
its
having
been
grossly
misrepresented
by
the
venal
part
of
the
public
press
i
believe
it
appeared
either
in
one
or
both
of
those
sinks
of
corruption
those
stews
of
falsehood
those
unblushing
vehicles
of
calumny
and
lies
the
morning
post
and
the
courier
viz
hunt
when
a
boy
was
turned
out
of
a
school
for
robbing
one
of
his
although
i
believe
there
is
not
one
disinterested
intelligent
person
in
a
thousand
who
reads
those
papers
that
ever
gives
the
least
credit
to
any
of
those
atrocious
falsehoods
with
which
their
columns
are
constantly
filled
yet
the
baseness
and
cowardice
of
their
intentions
are
not
the
less
disgraceful
on
that
account
to
proceed
my
bedfellow
whose
name
was
scott
when
he
arose
one
morning
discovered
that
during
the
night
his
breeches
had
been
removed
from
under
his
pillow
and
his
purse
which
contained
a
guinea
and
two
or
three
shillings
had
been
taken
out
of
the
pocket
ransacked
of
its
contents
and
then
replaced
under
the
pillow
scott
missed
the
money
as
he
was
getting
up
and
having
mentioned
the
thing
all
the
boys
collected
round
him
to
hear
his
account
of
the
story
there
were
also
some
boys
who
came
out
of
another
room
up
stairs
and
amongst
them
a
boy
of
the
name
of
best
who
after
having
heard
what
scott
had
to
say
at
once
declared
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
but
the
boy
who
had
slept
with
him
in
the
same
bed
to
have
stolen
the
money
i
instantly
fired
up
and
endeavoured
to
knock
down
the
scoundrel
who
had
by
implication
charged
me
with
the
theft
a
battle
ensued
in
which
best
got
the
worst
of
it
and
amongst
other
things
a
black
eye
which
being
perceived
by
evans
when
we
got
into
the
school
i
was
punished
with
an
imposition
for
having
given
it
to
him
notwithstanding
i
informed
the
master
that
it
arose
in
consequence
of
his
having
falsely
charged
me
with
a
theft
upon
this
an
investigation
took
place
scott
proved
that
he
had
the
money
when
he
went
to
bed
i
also
spoke
to
the
knowledge
of
that
fact
all
which
best
urged
as
a
presumptive
proof
of
my
guilt
appearances
were
against
me
and
my
having
so
suddenly
attacked
best
for
the
insinuation
rather
increased
than
diminished
those
appearances
after
breakfast
evans
called
me
into
his
parlour
where
there
was
no
one
but
himself
and
evans
and
addressed
me
in
a
very
solemn
manner
trusting
he
said
that
i
would
instantly
confess
to
him
that
had
played
some
trick
with
the
and
restore
it
to
him
in
which
case
he
would
endeavour
to
hush
the
matter
up
as
well
as
he
could
i
stood
gasping
with
astonishment
without
being
able
to
give
an
immediate
answer
not
before
believing
that
he
had
any
suspicion
of
me
he
proceeded
as
follows
it
is
no
use
for
you
to
deny
it
master
hunt
as
i
know
those
who
will
prove
that
they
saw
you
take
the
money
my
surprise
was
now
turned
to
indignation
i
protested
vehemently
against
the
truth
of
his
assertion
and
dared
him
to
the
proof
i
denied
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
i
knew
any
thing
of
the
money
and
demanded
with
more
than
common
earnestness
that
he
would
bring
forth
my
accusers
that
i
might
meet
them
face
to
face
evans
now
came
forward
and
earnestly
entreated
her
husband
in
common
justice
if
there
was
any
person
who
had
seen
me
or
if
he
had
any
proof
that
i
took
the
money
or
knew
any
thing
of
it
that
he
would
bring
them
forward
and
if
he
had
not
that
he
would
at
least
admit
that
he
had
no
ground
for
saying
what
he
had
said
evans
felt
the
force
of
her
observation
and
seeing
that
i
denied
the
fact
so
unequivocally
he
said
that
he
had
no
proof
of
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
too
far
that
as
circumstances
appeared
strong
against
me
at
first
and
it
appeared
that
i
was
embarrassed
he
thought
it
best
to
charge
me
boldly
with
it
to
induce
me
to
confess
at
once
evans
who
was
a
good
creature
and
a
sincere
lover
of
justice
possessing
too
a
great
deal
of
discrimination
inveighed
in
very
strong
terms
against
charging
a
boy
with
theft
and
casting
aspersions
upon
his
character
without
any
foundation
or
proof
whatever
she
added
that
i
had
been
at
the
school
nearly
three
years
without
ever
having
created
any
suspicion
of
my
honesty
or
without
doing
the
slightest
act
upon
which
they
could
ground
such
a
charge
that
she
had
frequently
trusted
me
with
money
to
execute
errands
and
commissions
for
her
that
i
had
always
done
it
with
the
strictest
regularity
and
the
most
scrupulous
regard
to
honesty
and
raising
her
voice
she
said
she
would
herself
be
bound
for
my
innocence
upon
this
occasion
adding
with
great
warmth
there
was
not
an
honester
lad
in
the
school
and
that
some
of
those
who
threw
out
dark
hints
of
suspicion
against
master
hunt
were
much
more
likely
from
their
general
character
to
have
robbed
scott
than
he
was
in
consequence
of
this
tone
being
taken
by
my
kind
friend
whose
memory
i
have
always
held
and
ever
shall
hold
in
the
highest
veneration
evans
slightly
apologized
for
having
asserted
that
he
had
proof
of
my
guilt
saying
in
excuse
that
it
was
his
duty
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
unravel
the
mystery
you
may
go
master
hunt
said
evans
and
in
the
kindest
possible
manner
she
endeavoured
to
console
me
for
the
injustice
i
had
suffered
by
telling
me
that
the
thief
would
certainly
be
found
out
and
then
those
that
had
accused
me
would
be
ashamed
of
themselves
as
i
walked
out
of
the
parlour
up
the
play
ground
many
of
my
school
fellows
approached
to
know
the
result
of
such
a
long
conference
well
hunt
is
there
any
thing
made
out
likely
to
clear
up
this
affair
all
of
them
anxious
to
see
me
fairly
acquitted
of
the
charge
i
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
what
a
d
d
liar
that
is
he
first
declared
that
some
one
had
seen
me
take
the
money
and
afterwards
confessed
it
was
no
such
thing
evans
who
had
followed
me
out
of
the
parlour
and
had
unperceived
by
me
walked
up
his
garden
which
was
only
separated
from
the
play
ground
by
some
pales
and
a
slight
low
yew
hedge
heard
this
as
plain
as
any
of
the
boys
in
a
very
emphatic
tone
and
close
to
my
elbow
he
to
my
utter
confusion
said
really
master
hunt
pray
sir
go
to
your
room
and
we
will
settle
that
account
as
soon
as
we
go
into
school
which
was
in
a
few
minutes
after
i
certainly
now
expected
that
i
should
have
a
severe
flogging
and
so
did
all
my
school
fellows
but
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
when
he
arrived
in
the
school
by
his
addressing
me
in
a
very
serious
manner
as
follows
master
hunt
i
now
set
you
an
imposition
of
one
hundred
lines
of
virgil
to
learn
by
friday
and
the
next
time
i
ever
hear
you
make
use
of
such
words
i
will
certainly
give
you
a
flogging
the
lines
were
learnt
and
so
ended
that
part
of
the
story
as
however
no
discovery
was
made
about
the
money
i
felt
very
uneasy
not
that
i
believed
any
of
the
boys
had
any
suspicion
of
me
and
scott
himself
constantly
declared
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
i
knew
any
thing
of
the
matter
notwithstanding
this
there
was
sometimes
an
insinuation
thrown
out
which
rendered
my
life
very
miserable
and
best
the
boy
who
had
first
accused
me
although
from
the
drubbing
he
got
he
was
deterred
from
repeating
the
assertion
yet
he
would
frequently
ask
in
my
hearing
stole
scott
money
a
month
had
nearly
passed
and
with
most
of
the
boys
the
affair
began
to
wear
off
and
it
was
seldom
mentioned
not
so
with
me
it
pressed
very
heavily
upon
my
mind
and
instead
of
being
one
of
the
most
lively
and
cheerful
boys
in
the
school
i
was
now
become
quite
serious
and
even
melancholy
and
was
frequently
observed
to
shed
tears
my
friends
endeavoured
to
rally
me
out
of
this
what
they
called
sulky
mood
i
replied
that
i
could
not
help
it
that
i
should
never
again
be
happy
till
it
was
discovered
who
it
was
that
took
my
money
and
that
its
being
lost
while
i
was
his
bed
fellow
certainly
threw
a
sort
of
suspicion
on
me
that
i
could
not
get
over
and
to
labour
under
which
rendered
me
completely
miserable
they
all
endeavoured
to
laugh
me
out
of
this
humour
and
i
must
say
that
scott
himself
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
relieve
me
but
it
was
all
in
vain
i
not
only
grew
melancholy
but
i
began
to
lose
my
appetite
and
as
i
looked
very
thin
and
ill
evans
was
really
somewhat
alarmed
and
said
every
thing
she
could
to
comfort
me
alas
it
was
all
in
vain
and
i
really
began
to
think
that
i
should
fall
a
victim
to
a
false
accusation
for
i
had
no
sleep
by
night
nor
ease
by
day

now
proposed
to
send
for
my
father
which
in
a
few
days
she
did
when
he
arrived
and
was
informed
of
the
circumstances
he
felt
greatly
distressed
i
was
sent
for
into
the
parlour
my
father
was
shocked
at
my
appearing
in
such
ill
health
and
the
agony
of
his
feelings
was
intense
at
the
cause
of
my
illness
he
intreated
me
by
the
love
i
bore
towards
him
and
my
mother
to
confess
the
truth
if
i
had
in
an
unguarded
moment
been
led
into
an
error
the
only
reparation
was
openly
to
confess
it
and
in
that
case
he
offered
immediately
to
repay
scott
his
money
and
to
make
him
a
handsome
present
besides
in
fact
he
promised
to
do
any
thing
before
he
would
allow
me
to
make
an
answer
he
went
almost
upon
his
knees
and
implored
me
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
proffering
at
the
same
time
his
entire
forgiveness
if
i
had
done
it
i
assured
him
in
the
most
serious
and
solemn
manner
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
money
that
it
had
made
me
very
unhappy
indeed
that
i
had
had
no
sleep
for
the
last
eight
or
ten
nights
and
had
lost
my
appetite
and
that
i
was
become
very
weak
and
ill
which
illness
he
found
by
feeling
my
pulse
was
attended
with
a
very
considerable
fever
he
proposed
to
take
me
home
for
a
short
time
to
restore
my
health
but
this
i
objected
to
as
being
likely
to
give
a
colour
to
the
charge
it
was
therefore
settled
that
i
should
take
some
medicine
prescribed
by
stills
to
calm
my
spirits
and
allay
my
fever
my
father
returned
home
almost
and
i
continued
in
the
same
melancholy
and
hopeless
state
however
in
the
evening
of
the
next
sunday
a
boy
came
running
up
to
me
almost
breathless
and
declared
that
he
had
discovered
the
thief
who
had
stolen
the
money
i
eagerly
entreated
him
to
explain
himself
he
answered
that
charles
best
together
with
his
brother
james
had
just
brought
in
a
hatful
of
which
be
said
he
had
bought
with
five
shillings
given
to
him
by
his
father
the
father
of
these
boys
lived
in
the
town
and
they
had
been
home
on
the
sunday
as
was
usual
to
dine
with
him
they
had
just
returned
from
their
visit
about
eight
in
the
evening
and
charles
the
eldest
the
fellow
who
had
accused
me
of
being
the
thief
had
now
brought
these
comfits
in
his
hat
saying
that
his
father
had
given
him
which
he
had
expended
at
once
in
this
way
my
friend
directly
declared
that
it
was
a
falsehood
that
his
father
was
a
cursedly
stingy
old
fellow
and
that
he
had
never
before
returned
with
more
than
sixpence
in
his
pocket
and
he
added
suppose
his
father
or
any
other
person
had
given
him
it
was
very
unlikely
that
he
would
lay
it
all
out
at
once
in
such
a
manner
i
requested
best
to
show
us
his
purse
to
see
if
he
had
any
more
money
in
it
this
he
declined
to
do
and
as
his
brother
james
began
to
shuffle
and
did
not
confirm
him
altogether
in
his
story
i
immediately
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
having
tripped
up
his
heels
called
for
assistance
to
search
him
this
we
accomplished
with
some
difficulty
and
having
got
at
his
purse
we
found
it
contained
in
silver
more
he
now
changed
his
tale
and
asserted
that
his
father
had
given
him
a
which
he
had
changed
at
hadding
the
that
he
had
purchased
five
of
carraway
comfits
and
the
sixteen
shillings
was
the
remainder
of
the
change
by
the
manner
of
his
telling
this
story
it
was
evidently
false
some
of
the
boys
accordingly
kept
him
in
custody
while
myself
and
my
friend
who
had
first
brought
me
the
intelligence
rushed
out
of
the
house
regardless
of
the
consequences
and
proceeded
as
fast
as
possible
to
the
house
of
old
best
either
to
have
this
account
confirmed
or
denied
on
our
reaching
the
door
we
knocked
with
great
authority
and
upon
the
servant
opening
it
we
marched
in
without
any
ceremony
and
demanded
an
audience
of
his
master
immediately
as
we
had
some
very
important
business
with
him
the
servant
informed
him
of
our
visit
and
he
came
out
of
the
parlour
to
us
and
demanded
what
business
we
could
have
with
him
at
that
time
of
night
it
being
then
nearly
nine
we
first
asked
if
his
sons
had
been
home
to
dine
with
him
he
answered
yes
and
that
they
had
left
his
house
upwards
of
an
hour
ago
in
order
to
return
to
the
school
and
he
wished
to
know
whether
they
had
not
arrived
before
we
left
it
we
replied
that
they
had
we
then
asked
him
if
he
had
given
his
son
charles
any
money
he
at
once
said
certainly
not
we
then
asked
him
if
he
had
given
him
a
guinea
he
replied
certainly
not
his
mother
might
have
given
him
sixpence
but
if
she
did
it
was
without
his
knowledge
he
then
returned
into
the
parlour
and
we
heard
him
ask
his
wife
if
she
had
given
charles
any
money
the
answer
was
no
my
dear
this
was
quite
enough
for
us
and
without
waiting
any
further
ceremony
we
started
off
back
to
the
school
in
the
mean
time
best
having
ascertained
that
we
were
gone
to
his
father
to
make
enquiry
had
confessed
that
it
was
he
who
had
stolen
the
money
out
of
scott
pocket
and
when
we
returned
he
was
surrounded
by
all
the
boys
who
were
upbraiding
and
taunting
him
with
his
villainy
but
they
were
all
more
enraged
with
him
for
his
baseness
in
accusing
me
of
the
theft
than
they
were
with
the
theft
itself
i
was
the
only
one
who
expressed
any
pity
for
him
and
had
the
weakness
to
solicit
for
that
mercy
to
be
shewn
to
him
which
he
had
denied
to
me
the
next
morning
he
was
expelled
the
school
but
in
consideration
of
his
family
very
little
was
said
about
it
however
they
soon
left
the
town
which
it
was
generally
understood
was
occasioned
by
this
unfortunate
event
my
father
was
sent
for
and
he
came
over
immediately
to
participate
with
me
in
the
happiness
i
felt
at
being
so
completely
exculpated
from
all
suspicion
and
every
endeavour
was
made
to
render
me
as
far
as
it
was
possible
compensation
for
my
sufferings
i
trust
that
this
circumstance
will
prove
to
the
reader
the
danger
and
the
injustice
of
condemning
any
person
upon
mere
circumstantial
evidence
how
cautious
ought
jurors
upon
their
oaths
to
be
not
to
find
men
guilty
upon
mere
circumstances
and
particularly
when
their
verdict
may
give
the
party
over
hand
and
and
place
his
life
or
his
liberty
at
the
disposal
of
corrupt
wicked
cruel
and
vindictive
judges
i
now
recovered
my
health
and
strength
and
prosecuted
my
studies
till
i
was
nearly
sixteen
years
of
age
my
father
then
on
condition
of
my
taking
orders
and
going
into
the
church
proposed
to
send
me
to
oxford
and
to
purchase
the
next
presentation
to
a
living
of
upwards
of
a
thousand
a
year
which
was
offered
to
him
at
that
time
at
a
very
moderate
price
subject
to
the
life
of
the
incumbent
who
was
upwards
of
seventy
years
of
age
this
i
declined
as
i
had
a
great
wish
to
be
a
farmer
and
at
the
same
time
had
a
particular
objection
to
the
church
an
objection
which
principally
originated
in
the
dislike
i
had
to
parson
griffith
and
to
the
way
in
which
he
enforced
the
precepts
of
christianity
my
father
desired
me
to
reflect
well
upon
it
before
i
made
up
my
mind
though
i
could
discover
that
he
was
not
at
all
displeased
at
my
determination
he
would
not
he
said
prejudice
my
choice
but
whether
i
was
a
clergyman
or
whether
i
was
a
farmer
he
hoped
i
should
make
a
good
a
brave
and
an
honest
man
but
he
added
if
you
intend
to
be
a
farmer
i
trust
that
it
is
not
from
an
idea
that
a
farmer
life
is
composed
merely
of
coursing
hunting
shooting
and
fishing
these
alone
said
he
are
very
well
when
occasionally
and
moderately
used
as
a
recreation
but
a
farmer
must
learn
his
business
before
he
is
capable
of
conducting
and
managing
a
farm
for
remember
the
old
couplet
he
that
by
the
plough
would
thrive
must
either
hold
himself
or
drive
i
would
therefore
have
you
think
this
matter
over
before
you
finally
make
your
choice
if
you
should
like
to
be
a
clergyman
i
have
now
an
opportunity
of
purchasing
the
next
presentation
to
a
good
living
and
you
will
then
have
secured
to
you
for
life
a
thousand
or
perhaps
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
you
will
have
nothing
else
to
do
for
six
days
out
of
the
seven
but
hunt
shoot
and
fish
by
day
and
play
cards
and
win
the
money
of
the
farmer
wives
and
children
by
night
although
continued
he
this
may
appear
to
you
and
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
this
is
a
very
inglorious
sort
of
a
life
yet
it
is
a
very
easy
one
all
that
will
be
expected
of
you
is
to
read
prayers
and
preach
a
sermon
which
will
cost
you
three
pence
once
a
week
this
is
the
life
of
modern
clergymen
and
they
might
do
very
well
and
get
on
very
smoothly
in
this
way
if
they
did
not
screw
up
their
too
high
and
get
drunk
too
often
so
as
to
cause
a
serious
complaint
to
be
made
to
the
bishop
by
some
of
the
parishioners
which
you
may
rest
assured
they
never
will
do
by
you
let
your
conduct
be
ever
so
immoral
or
ever
so
irreligious
provided
that
you
let
the
farmers
have
their
tythes
at
an
easy
rate
do
that
and
no
complaint
will
ever
be
made
against
you
to
the
bishop
while
my
father
was
thus
addressing
me
my
mother
returned
from
visiting
a
poor
gypsy
woman
who
had
that
morning
been
delivered
of
a
fine
child
under
an
adjoining
hedge
without
any
other
covering
but
one
of
their
small
tents
which
are
merely
composed
of
a
sheet
thrown
over
a
few
arched
sticks
stuck
into
the
ground
she
came
into
the
room
just
in
time
to
hear
the
latter
part
of
my
father
observations
describing
the
life
of
a
modern
clergyman
with
her
accustomed
charitable
feeling
she
said
really
my
dear
although
there
is
too
much
truth
in
the
picture
you
have
drawn
yet
you
have
been
a
little
too
severe
upon
the
clergy
when
speaking
of
them
in
the
mass
there
are
many
excellent
and
worthy
men
who
follow
the
precepts
of
their
great
master
who
are
an
ornament
to
that
society
to
which
they
belong
and
are
therefore
most
deserving
members
of
and
do
great
credit
to
the
profession
which
you
have
so
indiscriminately
reprobated
do
not
tell
me
said
my
father
about
ornaments
to
society
the
best
of
them
are
the
of
and
without
contributing
any
thing
to
the
common
stock
they
feed
upon
the
choicest
honey
collected
by
the
labour
of
the
industrious
bees
to
be
sure
when
they
do
the
duty
allotted
to
them
conscientiously
and
not
screw
up
their
tythes
too
they
may
be
very
necessary
evils
but
you
are
aware
my
dear
that
what
i
say
is
true
as
to
most
of
them
that
we
know
and
i
am
not
sorry
that
henry
appears
to
have
no
inclination
towards
that
course
of
life
but
said
my
mother
because
some
of
the
clergy
bear
the
character
that
you
say
they
do
is
that
any
reason
that
henry
should
follow
their
example
if
he
should
be
a
clergyman
he
will
have
great
power
of
doing
good
among
his
parishioners
he
may
be
a
magistrate
or
perhaps
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
who
knows
but
he
may
by
and
bye
be
a
bishop
my
father
now
began
to
grow
impatient
a
bishop
indeed
said
he
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
live
to
see
him
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
obtain
a
bishopric
even
if
he
were
to
go
into
the
church
my
mother
was
surprised
at
this
language
and
enquired
if
he
would
not
wish
his
son
to
gain
the
top
of
his
profession
to
which
he
answered
sternly
which
was
not
often
the
case
to
my
mother
no
indeed
i
would
not
the
road
to
such
preferment
is
generally
so
disgraceful
that
i
never
wish
to
see
him
tread
its
path
he
will
never
attain
such
an
but
by
the
most
means
would
you
like
to
see
him
the
tutor
to
the
son
of
some
nobleman
this
is
the
first
step
to
promotion
when
he
is
in
that
situation
if
his
pupil
should
be
of
an
abandoned
character
and
will
condescend
to
be
his
and
the
pander
to
his
vices
laugh
at
his
follies
and
flatter
his
vanity
why
then
should
this
sprig
of
nobility
hereafter
become
a
minister
of
state
or
a
man
in
power
knowing
the
servility
of
his
late
tutor
and
that
he
will
make
a
willing
tool
for
the
administration
to
which
he
belongs
then
forsooth
he
is
a
proper
man
and
may
possibly
become
a
bishop
my
mother
could
not
believe
that
the
highest
dignities
of
the
church
were
ever
obtained
by
such
disgraceful
means
but
my
father
justified
his
assertion
by
pointing
out
one
or
two
living
instances
that
had
come
within
the
reach
of
his
own
knowledge
he
also
pointed
out
some
dignitaries
of
the
church
who
lived
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
whom
my
mother
knew
and
was
obliged
to
admit
to
be
very
profligate
characters
but
she
always
wishing
to
look
at
the
bright
instead
of
the
dark
side
of
the
question
called
in
turn
to
his
recollection
a
number
of
very
excellent
and
very
worthy
members
of
the
church
whom
they
knew
to
be
most
amiable
charitable
and
truly
religions
characters
thus
ended
this
conference
upon
a
subject
which
appeared
to
be
so
very
important
to
my
parents
my
mother
certainly
had
a
great
leaning
to
the
desire
of
seeing
me
a
clergyman
and
i
believe
it
would
have
been
the
summit
of
her
happiness
and
ambition
to
have
seen
me
zealously
enforcing
those
principles
of
christianity
which
she
had
so
faithfully
practised
my
father
dropped
the
subject
at
that
time
but
he
took
an
early
opportunity
of
seriously
going
into
the
matter
in
private
and
he
exhorted
me
to
give
the
question
a
deliberate
consideration
as
it
most
materially
concerned
my
future
welfare
adding
he
that
sets
out
wrong
is
more
than
half
undone
if
said
he
you
intend
to
lead
a
quiet
easy
life
that
of
a
clergyman
will
exactly
suit
you
if
you
are
disposed
to
make
one
of
the
common
herd
of
mankind
and
pass
your
time
away
in
enjoying
the
sports
of
the
field
and
the
recreations
of
a
social
country
life
you
may
live
and
die
a
clergyman
and
a
very
happy
man
but
if
you
have
any
ambition
to
be
a
shining
character
in
the
world
that
is
the
very
last
profession
i
would
recommend
as
i
am
firmly
persuaded
that
you
will
have
no
chance
of
becoming
eminent
or
exalted
in
rank
unless
you
will
condescend
to
obtain
it
by
the
most
prostituted
sycophancy
and
a
total
dereliction
of
every
manly
noble
feeling
of
independence
if
i
had
been
wavering
in
my
decision
or
had
entertained
any
doubts
before
this
would
have
turned
the
scale
but
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
farmer
which
determination
i
seriously
and
firmly
communicated
to
my
father
well
then
said
he
you
are
young
enough
to
learn
and
if
you
will
manfully
set
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
soon
becoming
acquainted
with
the
practical
part
of
the
profession
and
when
you
have
acquired
a
knowledge
of
the
practice
the
theory
will
follow
very
easily
you
shall
make
a
beginning
you
are
now
sixteen
and
no
time
is
to
be
lost
god
and
nature
have
bestowed
upon
you
a
sound
mind
and
an
active
body
and
if
you
properly
apply
these
inestimable
blessings
there
is
no
doubt
of
your
becoming
a
useful
member
of
society
and
of
your
making
a
respectable
figure
in
the
world
but
never
forget
the
maxim
that
i
now
lay
down
for
your
future
guidance
recollect
that
man
can
never
dirt
his
hands
about
his
own
business
and
always
bear
in
mind
these
three
old
italian
proverbs
first
do
that
by
proxy
which
you
can
do
second
defer
till
that
which
can
be
done
well
third
neglect
small
matters
and
the
next
morning
i
was
called
up
early
and
to
begin
upon
my
labours
i
drove
one
of
the
teams
at
plough
all
day
i
came
home
very
tired
not
being
accustomed
to
labour
i
found
it
a
very
different
occupation
from
that
of
attending
my
studies
at
school
my
feet
were
sore
and
my
heels
were
galled
but
i
was
deterred
from
complaining
by
seeing
that
i
was
merely
performing
the
same
labour
that
little
plough
boys
of
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
were
only
receiving
sixpence
a
day
for
doing
driving
plough
was
therefore
not
only
soon
learned
but
it
became
very
irksome
to
me
and
as
i
thought
myself
full
as
good
a
man
as
the
lad
that
was
holding
i
demanded
before
the
week
was
up
that
he
should
change
places
with
me
this
he
refused
and
that
occurred
which
is
very
common
upon
such
occasions
i
threw
away
the
whip
and
having
seized
the
handle
of
the
plough
a
struggle
ensued
which
led
to
blows
at
length
the
horses
and
plough
were
both
abandoned
and
a
regular
fight
took
place
between
myself
and
the
under
carter
who
had
been
holding
the
plough
to
which
i
was
the
driver
i
soon
however
compelled
him
to
cry
hold
and
without
farther
ceremony
i
took
the
plough
and
he
the
whip
i
mention
this
trivial
circumstance
to
shew
the
reader
that
i
was
obliged
to
fight
my
way
into
a
practical
knowledge
of
agricultural
pursuits
my
father
well
knowing
from
experience
that
there
was
no
other
method
by
which
i
could
gain
a
complete
knowledge
of
farming
but
by
the
manual
performance
of
every
branch
of
the
profession
before
i
proceed
it
will
not
be
improper
to
observe
that
in
detailing
the
events
of
my
own
life
i
am
confined
to
the
strict
limits
which
truth
imposes
upon
my
pen
for
if
i
wished
either
to
exaggerate
or
to
embellish
by
any
imaginary
touches
such
as
may
be
admissible
and
in
fact
such
as
are
indulged
in
by
the
writers
of
common
events
i
should
be
liable
to
immediate
detection
and
exposure
because
i
am
detailing
circumstances
which
although
they
are
long
past
are
still
in
the
recollection
of
numerous
living
witnesses
in
fact
there
is
not
an
occurrence
that
i
have
hitherto
mentioned
but
what
is
within
the
knowledge
and
the
recollection
of
many
of
those
witnesses
and
very
many
of
the
most
important
events
which
i
shall
have
to
detail
will
be
familiar
to
hundreds
on
the
other
hand
there
are
certainly
many
facts
and
anecdotes
which
are
only
known
to
myself
and
those
immediately
connected
with
them
and
these
when
i
arrive
at
them
will
i
doubt
not
be
read
with
a
lively
interest
by
those
who
are
not
yet
in
the
secret
how
many
public
and
private
intrigues
are
carried
on
and
effected
all
that
i
can
promise
is
that
i
will
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
recollection
which
i
find
no
ways
impaired
by
imprisonment
record
the
truth
and
should
i
in
my
anxiety
to
speak
the
truth
sometimes
become
dull
tiresome
or
tedious
i
must
rely
upon
the
indulgence
of
the
reader
to
attribute
it
to
my
desire
that
the
public
should
be
made
acquainted
with
those
circumstances
which
appear
to
me
to
have
materially
contributed
to
the
formation
of
that
character
which
has
been
so
vilified
abused
and
misrepresented
by
the
venal
tools
and
corrupt
agents
of
a
system
of
persevering
fatal
misrule
such
as
was
never
equalled
in
any
age
or
in
any
country
to
proceed
i
now
found
that
i
was
encountering
greater
difficulties
than
i
had
anticipated
though
it
was
very
easy
to
learn
to
drive
plough
yet
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
be
able
to
hold
plough
well
i
returned
home
at
night
ten
times
more
tired
than
i
was
when
i
drove
the
first
day
my
feet
were
not
only
sore
but
my
legs
and
arms
ached
ready
to
drop
off
and
my
hands
were
in
a
gore
of
blood
and
blistered
all
over
my
poor
mother
began
now
to
lament
my
undertaking
and
threw
out
hints
how
much
better
and
easier
it
would
have
been
to
have
gone
to
oxford
and
have
been
now
preparing
myself
by
study
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
black
cloth
and
to
be
a
respectable
clergyman
instead
of
being
a
in
the
midst
of
her
advice
and
admonition
my
mother
did
not
forget
to
wash
my
hands
and
feet
and
plaster
up
my
lacerated
flesh
and
as
soon
as
she
had
made
me
comfortable
i
retired
to
rest
i
rose
refreshed
and
returned
the
next
day
with
renovated
vigour
to
my
task
to
be
brief
i
soon
because
a
good
ploughman
my
father
daily
witnessed
with
considerable
anxiety
my
zealous
and
persevering
exertions
and
as
i
proceeded
he
encouraged
me
by
the
most
animating
hopes
of
future
prospects
he
informed
me
that
he
had
remarked
with
no
small
pleasure
my
determination
to
excel
in
every
thing
that
i
undertook
and
that
i
set
about
every
thing
with
an
enthusiasm
calculated
to
surmount
all
difficulties
which
was
as
he
justly
observed
the
only
way
to
attain
any
object
or
to
arrive
at
any
degree
of
perfection
i
had
now
regularly
persevered
with
the
most
assiduous
industry
for
more
than
a
fortnight
and
although
i
was
but
a
tall
thin
stripling
i
perceived
that
i
gathered
strength
with
my
labour
and
what
i
at
first
found
to
be
the
most
trying
exertion
and
severe
hard
work
as
i
became
acquainted
with
the
art
it
appeared
a
pleasant
and
cheerful
occupation
for
i
could
now
turn
a
furrow
as
true
and
as
straight
as
the
path
of
an
arrow
my
father
who
was
an
excellent
and
an
accomplished
husbandman
never
failed
during
this
time
to
pass
some
part
of
the
day
with
me
in
order
to
instruct
me
how
to
set
my
plough
to
fix
the
share
and
point
and
so
to
regulate
its
various
bearings
as
to
make
it
at
the
same
time
it
did
the
work
well
go
easy
and
pleasant
to
the
holder
this
may
perhaps
be
very
uninteresting
to
many
sedentary
readers
and
to
those
who
are
mere
passing
observers
and
who
believe
that
there
is
no
art
in
holding
plough
but
they
are
very
much
mistaken
who
think
that
any
body
will
make
a
farmer
and
that
to
be
a
good
husbandman
is
the
natural
result
of
living
in
the
country
it
is
a
very
common
and
vulgar
saying
in
the
country
among
farmers
when
any
one
has
a
son
that
is
more
stupid
than
common
if
he
will
make
nothing
else
if
he
is
unfit
or
incapable
of
learning
any
business
or
trade
why
he
will
make
a
parson
but
to
make
a
good
farmer
a
man
must
have
served
a
double
apprenticeship
to
the
profession
and
after
that
he
must
be
a
philosopher
and
a
chemist
no
business
requires
the
exercise
of
a
man
patience
and
his
reasoning
faculties
so
much
as
that
of
a
farmer
every
day
nay
every
hour
produces
something
new
something
fresh
which
calls
forth
the
active
use
of
his
reason
his
exertion
and
his
talent
no
two
seasons
are
alike
and
scarcely
any
two
days
in
every
other
profession
or
business
a
clever
intelligent
person
can
calculate
for
any
given
number
of
hands
nearly
the
work
of
a
week
a
month
or
almost
a
year
in
advance
the
manufacturer
or
the
tradesman
has
a
constant
regular
routine
of
business
for
his
workmen
to
perform
and
if
he
be
called
from
his
home
for
any
length
of
time
he
can
leave
orders
what
work
almost
every
man
shall
do
till
his
return
but
the
occupation
and
that
of
all
his
servants
changes
with
the
weather
nay
it
becomes
his
peculiar
care
at
some
periods
of
the
year
to
watch
with
anxiety
every
change
of
the
wind
and
his
business
to
observe
the
direction
of
every
cloud
but
as
four
or
five
years
of
my
life
were
passed
in
practically
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
every
branch
of
this
most
valuable
and
respectable
occupation
i
shall
by
reciting
the
particular
occurrences
of
that
period
as
i
pass
along
convince
the
readers
of
this
work
of
that
which
they
little
suppose
to
be
the
case
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
a
man
to
be
a
philosopher
before
he
can
be
a
good
farmer
my
father
having
convinced
himself
of
my
capability
as
well
as
my
determination
to
persevere
in
acquiring
the
practical
manual
knowledge
of
the
various
branches
belonging
to
husbandry
now
said
that
he
was
not
only
satisfied
but
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
progress
i
had
made
and
therefore
i
should
now
have
a
respite
from
such
incessant
labour
and
should
take
my
poney
and
accompany
him
round
the
farms
to
inspect
and
to
assist
him
in
giving
directions
to
the
workmen
a
fresh
plough
boy
was
immediately
found
and
my
driver
the
vanquished
again
resumed
his
situation
between
the
handles
of
the
plough
very
well
pleased
with
my
removal
the
scene
to
which
i
was
now
introduced
opened
to
my
enquiring
eye
a
new
field
for
observation
and
what
i
had
heretofore
passed
over
as
common
occurrences
became
intensely
interesting
to
me
my
father
felt
great
delight
in
satisfying
my
eager
enquiries
and
instead
of
being
annoyed
at
my
unceasing
inquisitiveness
he
encouraged
me
to
satisfy
myself
and
not
to
leave
any
one
subject
till
he
had
made
me
comprehend
the
cause
as
well
as
the
effect
about
this
time
my
mother
who
had
been
for
several
years
in
a
very
declining
state
of
health
from
a
violent
nervous
affection
which
produced
a
constant
oppressive
was
put
to
bed
of
a
son
her
sixth
child
and
to
the
great
joy
of
my
father
as
well
as
all
her
friends
as
she
recovered
her
strength
and
the
natural
effects
of
her
wore
off
she
appeared
also
to
have
recovered
her
general
good
health
and
her
usual
cheerfulness
she
was
always
benignant
kind
and
affectionate
but
the
effects
of
an
incessant
nervous
headache
had
produced
a
sombre
sadness
which
threw
a
gloom
around
and
affected
the
whole
family
and
prevented
that
sort
of
hilarity
and
cheerfulness
which
was
the
usual
companion
of
our
abode
my
father
was
of
a
generous
hospitable
sociable
disposition
and
was
never
so
happy
and
blessed
as
when
he
had
his
friends
surrounding
him
and
partaking
of
those
comforts
which
he
had
acquired
by
his
industry
skill
and
persevering
attention
to
his
business
but
even
these
sociable
enjoyments
with
his
friends
had
been
very
much
curtailed
by
my
dear
mother
melancholy
indisposition
the
restoration
of
her
health
was
hailed
by
my
father
as
the
greatest
blessing
that
divine
providence
could
have
bestowed
upon
him
and
his
family
and
we
were
all
made
to
join
him
in
audibly
offering
up
our
nightly
prayers
and
grateful
acknowledgments
to
the
allwise
and
beneficent
creator
for
this
to
us
the
greatest
of
earthly
blessings
my
father
was
enraptured
and
a
hundred
times
a
day
while
he
burst
forth
into
sincere
and
extatic
praise
and
adoration
of
the
goodness
of
the
divine
being
he
would
enjoin
us
his
children
never
to
forget
his
mercy
and
loving
kindness
in
restoring
his
dear
elizabeth
to
health
he
also
called
in
his
friends
again
to
partake
of
his
hospitable
and
festive
board
in
fact
he
would
sometimes
exclaim
to
my
mother
that
he
was
almost
too
happy
for
a
mortal
in
this
vale
of
misery
and
probation
my
amiable
mother
used
gently
to
chide
him
and
to
tell
him
that
the
best
way
to
manifest
their
gratitude
to
divine
providence
for
the
happiness
which
it
bestowed
was
never
to
let
a
day
pass
over
their
heads
without
doing
some
good
act
to
prove
their
willingness
to
deserve
it
she
would
add
with
her
eye
beaming
a
heavenly
smile
as
our
blessed
saviour
has
bestowed
every
earthly
comfort
upon
us
let
it
be
part
of
our
duty
and
our
pleasure
to
dispense
happiness
among
our
poorer
and
less
fortunate
neighbours
for
recollect
my
dear
all
our
doings
without
charity
are
nothing
worth
my
mother
had
not
yet
been
able
personally
to
perform
any
of
her
accustomed
charitable
visits
since
her
lying
in
for
she
was
too
strict
an
observer
of
her
religious
duties
to
go
from
home
till
she
had
gone
to
the
parish
church
and
publicly
offered
up
her
prayers
and
thanksgivings
to
her
blessed
creator
and
saviour
the
following
sunday
was
fixed
upon
as
the
day
for
this
religious
ceremony
my
father
expostulated
saying
that
the
church
was
damp
and
that
she
had
better
defer
it
till
the
next
sunday
and
in
the
mean
time
take
some
gentle
walks
abroad
to
enure
herself
by
degrees
to
bear
the
walk
and
the
fatigue
of
remaining
in
the
church
during
the
length
of
the
service
he
expressed
his
great
dread
of
her
catching
cold
and
having
a
relapse
in
consequence
but
she
firmly
replied
that
she
never
feared
any
evil
when
she
was
performing
a
sacred
religious
duty
that
god
was
too
wise
and
too
good
to
permit
one
of
his
creatures
to
suffer
when
in
the
act
of
obeying
his
commands
and
she
urged
so
many
pious
reasons
to
shew
the
necessity
of
her
not
delaying
to
perform
what
she
termed
her
indispensable
duty
that
my
father
silently
but
very
reluctantly
submitted
to
her
decision
but
alas
alas
my
father
prophetic
forebodings
were
but
too
well
founded
the
ways
of
god
are
just
and
the
dispensations
of
his
wisdom
are
not
to
be
scanned
much
more
disputed
by
impious
man
to
submit
to
his
divine
will
without
repining
is
the
imperative
duty
of
every
sincere
christian
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
nor
the
care
and
anxiety
of
my
excellent
father
we
set
off
early
in
order
to
walk
leisurely
to
church
that
my
mother
should
not
be
so
heated
as
to
render
her
liable
to
catch
cold
there
was
my
mother
leaning
on
the
right
upon
my
father
and
on
the
left
upon
me
and
two
of
my
sisters
elizabeth
and
sophia
the
one
about
five
and
the
other
about
seven
years
old
skipping
lightly
along
before
us
my
mother
enjoyed
the
walk
very
much
and
as
my
father
led
her
into
the
church
preceded
by
the
clergyman
upon
whom
we
had
called
in
our
way
thither
the
whole
congregation
spontaneously
rose
up
to
greet
and
to
welcome
their
best
and
kindest
benefactress
and
amiable
neighbour
a
gleam
of
pleasure
beamed
from
every
eye
and
the
curtseys
and
bows
that
were
bestowed
upon
her
as
she
passed
along
the
aisle
most
clearly
shewed
that
they
proceeded
from
the
impulse
of
grateful
hearts
with
a
heavenly
smile
of
inward
delight
and
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
sweetness
she
returned
their
kind
salutations
it
was
an
enviable
sight
and
it
imparted
to
me
such
sensations
of
pride
and
delight
as
have
been
seldom
if
ever
equalled
since
to
see
an
amiable
parent
upon
such
an
occasion
receive
the
spontaneous
willing
homage
of
three
or
four
hundred
the
whole
of
her
poorer
neighbours
and
the
sincere
congratulations
and
kind
attentions
of
all
her
friends
of
this
happy
village
was
a
scene
never
likely
to
be
erased
from
the
memory
every
heart
appeared
to
leap
with
joy
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
that
the
whole
congregation
were
preparing
to
join
in
prayer
and
to
participate
in
the
performance
of
the
divine
service
of
the
afternoon
with
more
than
usual
earnestness
and
zealous
piety
my
mother
who
was
a
tall
thin
elegant
figure
and
very
fair
had
a
roseate
flush
spread
over
her
delicate
features
and
she
looked
beautiful
as
she
knelt
to
offer
up
her
grateful
and
sincere
adoration
to
the
omnipotent
omnipresent
merciful
disposer
of
all
i
believe
that
my
father
was
the
only
person
amongst
the
whole
congregation
who
did
not
at
that
moment
enjoy
unmixed
delight
i
could
discover
that
his
enquiring
eye
was
more
frequently
fixed
upon
my
mother
than
it
was
upon
his
a
sort
of
uneasy
doubt
sat
visible
upon
his
brow
and
it
was
plainly
to
be
perceived
that
his
prayers
were
interrupted
by
his
meditations
upon
the
fearful
consequences
which
he
apprehended
might
be
the
result
of
my
mother
catching
cold
by
remaining
within
the
walls
of
a
large
damp
building
and
that
building
only
inhabited
for
a
few
hours
once
a
week
but
while
he
was
anticipating
earthly
misery
by
the
loss
of
the
greatest
blessing
that
kind
heaven
had
ever
bestowed
upon
man
my
angelic
mother
soul
and
body
were
alike
absorbed
in
the
most
devout
and
earnest
prayer
in
the
mean
time
the
beautiful
rosy
hue
that
had
spread
such
a
lustre
over
her
fair
face
disappeared
my
father
intense
anxiety
now
became
so
obvious
to
me
that
the
dreadful
uneasiness
of
mind
which
he
displayed
drew
my
attention
to
the
paleness
which
had
succeeded
the
colour
upon
her
cheek
the
instant
the
clergyman
began
to
pronounce
the
concluding
prayer
the
peace
of
god
my
father
flew
across
the
seat
while
my
mother
was
yet
on
her
knees
joining
most
fervently
and
devoutly
in
that
beautiful
sentence
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
half
whisper
which
was
heard
all
over
the
church
for
god
sake
are
you
not
well
my
love
she
appeared
surprised
at
the
earnestness
of
his
manner
and
rather
hurt
at
being
interrupted
in
her
devotions
but
replied
that
she
was
very
well
only
a
little
cold
he
hurried
her
out
of
the
church
and
scarcely
gave
her
time
to
return
the
salutations
of
her
neighbours
requesting
her
to
take
his
and
my
arm
and
hasten
home
as
fast
as
possible
to
avoid
the
effect
of
a
chill
which
he
very
much
feared
that
she
had
taken
in
the
church
when
we
got
home
she
was
rather
fatigued
but
though
the
colour
that
had
adorned
her
face
did
not
return
she
ate
her
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
and
my
father
began
to
hope
that
his
fears
were
groundless
his
hope
was
soon
blighted
my
mother
suddenly
screamed
out
saying
that
she
had
a
violent
pain
in
one
of
her
feet
she
complained
of
this
pain
sometimes
in
one
foot
and
sometimes
in
the
other
till
bed
time
but
my
father
in
order
to
hide
his
own
forebodings
endeavoured
to
rally
her
and
in
a
joking
way
told
her
she
was
going
to
have
the
gout
she
took
some
warm
gruel
and
retired
early
to
rest
about
twelve
my
father
came
into
my
bedroom
to
awake
me
and
desired
me
to
rise
immediately
take
my
horse
and
go
for
the
family
apothecary
who
lived
at
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
i
who
was
accustomed
to
rise
at
a
moment
warning
jumped
out
of
bed
and
with
the
greatest
haste
performed
the
sad
office
i
accompanied
the
apothecary
to
her
bedside
before
two
for
i
had
made
my
poney
almost
fly
thither
and
back
we
found
my
poor
father
who
had
been
anxiously
attending
the
progress
of
her
disorder
in
great
distress
she
had
no
sooner
gone
to
bed
than
she
was
seized
with
cold
chills
which
continued
with
alternate
fever
the
paroxysms
of
which
had
increased
with
such
violence
that
she
was
already
partially
delirious
the
next
day
barvis
from
devizes
attended
her
and
pronounced
her
in
considerable
danger
i
mounted
my
poney
rode
back
with
him
and
soon
returned
again
with
the
medicine
he
had
prescribed
but
my
mother
disorder
baffled
all
their
skill
and
attention
my
poor
father
was
distracted
he
never
quitted
her
bedside
for
a
moment
all
his
large
farming
concerns
were
left
to
the
care
of
the
servants
he
desired
me
to
go
to
them
on
the
monday
morning
the
day
after
my
mother
was
taken
ill
and
to
request
them
all
to
do
their
best
in
each
of
their
separate
departments
and
they
were
left
entirely
to
themselves
every
other
thought
but
what
was
directed
to
the
attention
and
care
of
my
mother
was
abandoned
my
father
whom
i
had
never
known
to
neglect
seeing
all
his
servants
once
a
day
at
least
and
who
suffered
nothing
to
be
done
unless
it
was
under
his
immediate
direction
would
not
now
listen
even
to
an
inquiry
about
his
business
his
whole
soul
was
wrapped
up
in
his
attention
to
my
mother
whose
illness
he
had
anticipated
with
a
presaging
spirit
even
before
it
came
upon
her
i
was
incessantly
employed
in
going
too
and
from
the
medical
attendants
and
assisting
to
wait
upon
my
mother
and
from
the
time
of
her
first
attack
she
took
nothing
but
from
the
hand
either
of
myself
or
my
father
her
illness
was
now
pronounced
to
be
a
determined
putrid
fever
and
she
was
continually
in
a
delirious
state
her
infant
son
william
had
been
kindly
received
to
nurse
by
an
excellent
neighbour
mrs
patient
of
compton
a
most
worthy
lady
who
nursed
him
and
her
own
son
together
with
great
and
ease
to
herself
my
mother
grew
worse
and
worse
and
was
at
length
pronounced
by
the
physician
past
all
hopes
of
recovery
my
poor
father
was
frantic
he
who
possessed
the
most
manly
resolution
and
firmness
upon
all
other
occasions
was
now
by
excessive
grief
and
despair
reduced
almost
to
the
level
of
a
child
he
alternately
wept
and
prayed
but
he
wept
and
prayed
in
vain
i
was
at
this
time
under
seventeen
years
of
age
and
i
had
scarcely
time
to
vent
my
sorrow
although
i
was
distressed
beyond
measure
at
the
suffering
of
my
mother
yet
the
affliction
the
indiscribable
anguish
of
my
father
demanded
almost
as
much
of
my
attention
as
the
illness
of
my
mother
to
see
his
noble
soul
bent
down
to
the
earth
driven
almost
to
the
madness
of
desperation
was
to
me
a
more
spectacle
than
the
delirium
which
produced
a
sort
of
stupor
in
my
mother
she
had
not
been
sensible
for
any
considerable
period
of
time
together
for
two
days
and
we
were
under
dreadful
apprehensions
that
she
would
be
taken
from
us
without
ever
recovering
her
reason
this
my
poor
father
dreaded
excessively
yet
the
very
thing
we
most
prayed
for
proved
when
it
was
ultimately
granted
to
us
our
greatest
affliction
so
incapable
are
poor
frail
mortals
of
judging
what
is
best
for
them
under
such
trying
circumstances
my
mother
had
now
lain
as
it
were
in
a
doze
for
about
two
hours
and
my
father
and
myself
who
were
anxiously
watching
every
breath
observed
her
awake
up
as
if
it
were
from
a
sound
sleep
she
appeared
to
feel
as
if
she
had
recovered
from
a
trance
she
spoke
and
to
the
great
joy
of
my
father
and
myself
she
was
perfectly
collected
but
our
joy
was
of
the
most
transient
nature
she
looked
around
in
the
most
melancholy
manner
and
having
enquired
where
all
the
children
were
gone
she
expressed
a
great
desire
to
see
them
before
she
breathed
her
last
for
she
said
she
was
perfectly
sensible
of
her
situation
and
she
must
see
her
children
once
more
they
had
all
been
removed
to
the
house
of
a
friend
as
those
who
remained
were
considered
in
imminent
danger
from
infection
the
putrid
state
of
my
mother
having
assumed
a
very
alarming
appearance
and
no
one
was
now
left
except
my
father
myself
and
the
nurse
the
maid
servant
having
already
failed
with
the
fever
my
poor
father
had
entreated
nay
had
commanded
also
to
save
myself
by
flight
but
upon
my
knees
i
implored
him
to
let
me
remain
and
participate
with
him
in
performing
the
last
sad
office
for
my
dear
mother
i
told
him
that
i
should
break
my
heart
to
leave
him
alone
for
he
really
was
now
become
an
object
of
much
greater
pity
than
my
dying
parent
my
mother
repeated
so
earnestly
her
wish
to
see
her
children
that
they
were
immediately
sent
for
and
she
took
a
last
sad
farewell
of
them
they
were
hastened
out
of
the
room
that
they
might
be
removed
at
once
from
such
a
melancholy
scene
and
from
the
serious
danger
of
contagion
arising
from
the
dreadful
state
of
their
mother
to
those
who
have
never
witnessed
a
parting
of
this
sort
any
attempt
of
mine
to
convey
to
them
even
a
slight
representation
of
the
agony
it
inflicts
on
those
who
undergo
it
would
be
in
vain
for
it
is
impossible
the
great
exertion
of
my
poor
mother
during
this
affecting
scene
was
such
as
left
her
almost
without
the
power
of
speech
her
respiration
became
excessively
quick
and
my
afflicted
father
exclaimed
i
shall
never
hear
her
voice
again
she
however
soon
recovered
a
little
and
in
the
most
plaintive
strain
lamented
her
approaching
end
and
prayed
aloud
to
her
blessed
saviour
to
spare
her
life
that
she
might
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
children
brought
up
in
fact
this
most
excellent
of
women
appeared
very
much
to
dread
the
hand
of
death
my
father
now
implored
her
to
be
tranquillised
and
in
the
most
tender
and
affectionate
manner
assured
her
that
of
all
living
creatures
she
was
he
thought
the
best
prepared
to
enter
the
presence
of
her
creator
she
calmly
replied
that
though
to
her
knowledge
she
had
never
intentionally
injured
any
human
being
either
in
word
or
though
she
had
never
neglected
her
duty
to
her
maker
but
had
always
acted
to
the
best
of
her
judgment
so
as
to
deserve
his
mercy
yet
she
trembled
and
doubted
and
feared
to
die
my
father
now
observed
that
her
voice
faltered
and
to
draw
her
attention
from
such
a
painful
subject
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
me
supposing
that
she
was
becoming
insensible
with
the
kindest
look
she
took
my
hand
and
gently
replied
i
know
him
perfectly
well
god
bless
him
she
then
seized
his
hand
also
and
instantly
expired
grasping
both
thus
breathed
the
last
of
as
bright
as
lovely
and
as
perfect
a
pattern
of
christian
piety
as
ever
lived
to
grace
society
and
to
adorn
and
bless
a
husband
and
family
my
father
sorrow
was
now
become
too
intense
for
outward
shew
he
stood
dumb
and
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
and
rivetted
upon
her
in
whose
death
he
felt
that
he
had
sustained
an
irretrievable
loss
we
had
both
still
hold
of
her
hands
his
mute
immovable
figure
looked
like
a
statue
and
i
fancied
that
his
heart
was
breaking
i
seized
him
by
the
hand
and
in
the
most
supplicating
manner
implored
him
to
leave
the
room
my
extreme
sorrow
seemed
to
awake
him
from
his
trance
and
i
led
him
gently
and
he
followed
involuntarily
out
of
the
chamber
having
seated
him
in
his
armed
chair
i
knelt
before
him
and
threw
my
head
in
his
lap
there
i
gave
a
loose
to
my
grief
and
mingled
my
tears
with
those
which
were
now
flowing
in
streams
down
his
manly
cheeks
to
endeavour
to
describe
what
i
felt
upon
this
melancholy
event
would
be
puerile
in
the
extreme
none
but
those
who
have
been
placed
in
a
similar
situation
are
capable
of
comprehending
the
distress
which
enters
the
soul
of
such
a
husband
and
child
who
had
witnessed
the
last
sad
moments
of
such
a
wife
and
mother
to
have
dwelt
so
long
upon
such
a
melancholy
subject
may
perhaps
appear
to
some
of
my
readers
to
be
not
only
unnecessary
but
tedious
i
must
therefore
intreat
their
indulgence
by
confessing
my
error
if
an
error
it
be
at
the
same
time
i
must
assure
them
that
i
believe
this
to
have
not
only
been
the
most
important
event
of
my
life
but
that
it
was
a
matter
of
more
serious
importance
to
me
than
all
the
occurrences
of
my
previous
existence
multiplied
ten
times
ten
fold
and
this
being
the
case
i
shall
rely
upon
their
kind
forgiveness
with
great
confidence
for
i
feel
that
every
incident
of
my
life
for
many
years
after
this
may
be
fairly
said
to
have
been
influenced
in
some
degree
or
in
some
way
or
other
by
this
ever
to
be
regretted
never
to
be
forgotten
loss
my
father
remained
absorbed
in
melancholy
shut
himself
up
and
refused
to
see
any
one
till
after
the
last
sad
office
had
been
performed
for
my
mother
in
the
mean
time
he
gave
me
instructions
to
overlook
all
the
servants
and
to
superintend
their
work
at
length
the
day
arrived
for
performing
the
ceremony
of
depositing
her
honoured
remains
in
the
family
vault
which
was
in
the
chancel
of
the
parish
church
my
father
and
myself
followed
as
and
during
the
performance
of
the
funeral
service
i
believe
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
amongst
the
numerous
congregation
who
attended
every
one
felt
that
he
had
sustained
a
loss
my
father
was
so
agitated
that
i
thought
at
one
moment
he
would
have
thrown
himself
headlong
into
the
grave
upon
my
mother
coffin
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
he
was
drawn
from
the
sacred
spot
the
maid
servant
was
yet
confined
to
her
bed
very
ill
with
the
fever
and
my
eldest
sister
who
was
about
thirteen
years
of
age
also
fell
sick
the
morning
before
the
funeral
took
place
when
we
returned
from
church
we
found
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
bed
and
the
apothecary
declared
that
she
also
had
taken
the
fever
my
father
was
very
much
alarmed
for
the
consequences
and
he
now
devoted
his
whole
attention
to
the
care
of
my
sister
and
left
me
entirely
to
manage
his
business
the
servant
soon
got
well
in
spite
as
it
were
of
herself
for
having
heard
the
dogs
howl
very
much
one
night
the
circumstance
made
such
an
impression
upon
her
weak
fearful
mind
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
she
could
be
persuaded
that
she
was
better
the
howling
of
the
dogs
she
considered
as
a
certain
omen
of
her
death
and
she
gave
herself
up
entirely
to
this
ridiculous
notion
nor
could
any
thing
short
of
a
most
excellent
constitution
have
saved
her
from
falling
a
prey
to
her
own
superstition
however
having
been
almost
forced
out
of
her
bed
and
persuaded
with
difficulty
to
put
on
her
cloaths
she
soon
found
to
her
great
astonishment
that
she
was
as
well
as
ever
she
was
in
her
life
with
the
exception
of
being
a
little
languid
from
the
effects
of
the
fever
the
recovery
of
poor
betty
kite
was
a
great
comfort
to
the
whole
family
for
although
she
was
one
of
the
plainest
women
in
the
world
and
also
very
illiterate
and
full
of
superstition
yet
she
was
an
unequalled
servant
both
as
to
cleanliness
and
work
i
was
a
great
plague
to
her
in
various
ways
she
not
being
the
best
tempered
woman
in
the
world
i
used
to
irritate
her
very
much
by
imitating
the
howling
of
dogs
and
the
complaints
that
she
frequently
made
to
my
father
of
my
conduct
to
her
were
truly
ridiculous
my
father
was
now
left
a
widower
in
the
prime
of
life
at
least
he
considered
himself
quite
in
the
prime
of
life
at
the
age
of
with
six
children
myself
the
least
three
sisters
and
two
brothers
with
such
a
family
the
loss
of
a
mother
is
at
all
times
and
under
almost
all
circumstances
the
most
serious
and
irreparable
but
the
loss
of
such
a
mother
as
ours
alas
it
was
most
distressing
ours
was
indeed
a
house
of
joy
turned
into
a
house
of
mourning
it
was
not
the
same
house
it
was
not
the
same
family
there
stood
my
poor
departed
mother
chair
and
the
sight
of
the
vacant
seat
perpetually
called
forth
our
tears
and
sighs
and
lamentations
my
father
would
not
have
it
removed
but
i
must
quit
this
subject
or
i
shall
dwell
upon
it
for
ever
my
sister
recovered
from
the
fever
but
there
remained
such
a
languor
and
weakness
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
walk
alone
my
father
dreaded
her
loss
now
almost
as
much
as
he
had
before
dreaded
that
of
my
mother
he
devoted
a
great
portion
of
his
time
to
her
and
i
was
still
left
to
look
after
his
very
extensive
business
i
shall
never
forget
the
authority
i
now
began
to
assume
i
was
as
dictatorial
over
the
servants
and
gave
my
commands
as
peremptorily
as
if
i
had
been
an
old
farmer
some
of
the
old
servants
who
knew
that
my
directions
were
improper
disputed
my
commands
and
expostulated
against
my
proceedings
however
like
a
true
jack
in
office
feeling
that
i
was
clothed
with
power
i
considered
this
brief
authority
to
be
and
like
all
other
ignorant
upstarts
what
i
was
deficient
in
knowledge
and
real
information
i
made
up
in
positiveness
but
i
soon
found
that
by
this
foolish
course
i
lost
all
influence
and
that
i
was
laughed
at
by
the
old
servants
who
knew
very
well
how
to
please
my
father
and
i
was
therefore
astonished
that
they
did
not
know
how
to
please
me
my
own
sense
now
whispered
to
me
that
i
must
be
wrong
yet
i
nevertheless
appealed
to
my
father
and
complained
of
some
of
the
servants
having
refused
to
comply
with
my
directions
he
enquired
what
those
directions
were
and
he
soon
taught
me
that
i
ought
to
have
applied
for
information
to
and
have
followed
the
advice
of
those
very
men
with
whom
i
had
been
contending
my
father
then
pointed
out
to
me
the
absolute
necessity
of
becoming
a
master
of
my
own
business
and
learning
how
to
do
the
work
myself
before
i
attempted
to
give
directions
to
others
this
want
of
knowledge
said
he
causes
more
than
half
of
the
quarrels
and
squabbles
that
arise
between
the
master
and
the
servant
the
moment
a
servant
finds
out
that
his
master
does
not
understand
the
nature
of
his
business
he
immediately
begins
to
dispute
his
orders
and
then
there
is
an
end
of
all
authority
the
master
probably
perseveres
in
his
error
and
insists
upon
it
that
his
servant
has
not
done
his
work
properly
or
that
he
has
not
done
enough
and
the
moment
a
master
orders
a
servant
to
do
what
is
unreasonable
that
moment
the
servant
despises
the
master
and
unless
the
master
knows
how
himself
to
shew
the
servant
with
his
own
hands
the
way
to
do
any
thing
he
had
better
hold
his
tongue
and
not
find
any
fault
whatever
i
found
my
old
neighbour
barnes
continued
he
the
other
day
in
this
predicament
although
he
has
been
for
many
many
years
a
farmer
and
manages
his
farm
as
well
as
most
men
yet
as
he
was
bred
up
a
gardener
he
does
not
know
nor
did
he
ever
learn
how
to
perform
many
of
the
laborious
parts
of
husbandry
and
i
shall
i
am
sure
convince
you
from
what
occurred
to
him
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
every
minute
operation
belonging
to
the
affairs
of
husbandry
before
you
will
be
able
to
manage
your
business
with
ease
to
yourself
and
with
satisfaction
to
your
servants
as
i
was
riding
past
the
risk
yard
of
my
worthy
friend
and
neighbour
barnes
farm
i
heard
him
storming
and
blustering
quite
in
a
rage
with
passion
what
is
the
matter
friend
barnes
what
is
it
that
has
ruffed
your
temper
so
he
was
nearly
choaked
with
passion
but
at
length
he
informed
me
that
one
of
his
labourers
of
the
name
of
rodney
who
i
believe
had
acquired
this
nick
name
from
the
circumstance
of
his
having
been
a
sailor
and
fought
under
admiral
rodney
had
behaved
to
him
in
the
most
insolent
manner
what
has
he
done
neighbour
barnes
why
said
he
i
found
fault
with
the
fellow
several
times
for
not
making
the
properly
for
thatching
the
ricks
and
he
told
me
as
often
that
he
could
not
make
them
any
better
and
at
length
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
pulled
out
his
purse
and
with
an
oath
declared
that
he
would
make
an
helm
with
me
for
a
wager
of
a
shilling
well
neighbour
barnes
what
did
you
do
did
you
accept
his
offer
or
did
you
shew
him
how
to
do
it
without
the
wager
oh
no
replied
he
i
will
send
the
insolent
scoundrel
about
his
business
upon
which
guessing
that
my
neighbour
did
not
understand
how
to
make
a
helm
himself
therefore
could
not
shew
the
man
how
to
do
it
i
said
let
me
see
the
fellow
and
talk
to
him
a
little
and
hear
what
he
has
got
to
say
for
himself
and
let
me
see
whether
i
can
not
make
him
do
his
work
better
we
then
rode
back
together
to
the
man
who
was
doing
his
work
certainly
not
so
well
as
it
ought
to
have
been
done
well
rodney
said
i
to
him
what
is
all
this
dispute
about
between
your
master
and
you
lord
sir
replied
the
man
i
do
the
work
as
well
as
i
can
but
master
is
always
finding
fault
and
wont
show
me
how
to
do
it
better
i
am
very
willing
to
learn
sir
and
if
you
will
please
to
show
me
how
i
will
do
any
thing
to
please
in
my
power
i
then
alighted
from
my
horse
and
having
made
some
helms
convinced
the
man
of
his
error
by
ocular
demonstration
he
was
very
thankful
for
my
kindness
immediately
followed
my
example
and
did
the
remainder
of
his
work
to
the
thorough
satisfaction
of
his
master
as
well
as
with
ease
to
himself
barnes
was
now
grown
cool
and
while
he
expressed
his
thanks
to
me
he
admitted
the
great
superiority
that
a
man
who
knows
the
practical
part
of
his
business
had
over
one
who
only
knew
the
theory
this
was
the
method
my
father
took
to
instruct
me
in
useful
knowledge
and
as
my
sister
grew
better
and
gained
strength
he
by
degrees
began
to
accompany
me
over
his
farms
again
and
in
his
rounds
he
made
it
his
peculiar
business
to
explain
every
part
of
the
operations
that
were
in
progress
by
the
servants
he
appeared
to
take
quite
as
much
delight
in
cultivating
my
mind
as
he
did
in
cultivating
the
soil
and
no
man
knew
better
than
he
did
how
to
cultivate
the
soil
and
manage
a
farm
in
all
its
branches
when
there
was
any
particular
work
to
do
i
always
made
a
hand
in
it
and
my
father
never
failed
to
take
pains
to
shew
me
how
to
do
it
well
and
in
the
most
scientific
manner
always
observing
that
no
man
could
perform
his
work
well
unless
he
appeared
to
do
it
easily
to
himself
sowing
time
came
i
learned
to
sow
haymaking
time
came
i
learned
to
mow
harvest
came
i
learned
to
reap
in
fact
i
learned
not
only
to
plough
to
sow
to
reap
to
mow
to
pitch
to
load
to
make
ricks
to
thrash
and
to
winnow
but
i
made
it
my
study
to
excel
in
all
these
things
and
in
recounting
some
of
my
feats
of
activity
strength
agility
and
perseverance
in
these
matters
the
reader
will
recollect
that
i
am
recording
them
in
the
life
time
of
numerous
individuals
who
were
of
these
facts
and
who
worked
side
by
side
with
me
and
as
i
know
that
this
work
is
taken
in
and
read
not
only
by
my
old
but
also
by
my
old
they
who
peruse
these
pages
will
take
into
their
consideration
that
i
am
not
writing
neither
are
they
reading
a
novel
or
a
romance
that
on
the
contrary
they
are
perusing
the
real
facts
that
have
occurred
within
the
knowledge
and
the
recollection
of
thousands
after
the
labour
of
the
day
was
over
and
the
servants
had
retired
to
their
homes
to
obtain
their
natural
rest
to
fit
them
for
the
toils
of
the
coming
morn
my
father
used
to
read
alternately
with
myself
some
useful
or
entertaining
book
and
be
frequently
lamented
that
i
appeared
to
give
up
so
much
the
study
of
my
latin
books
i
had
all
along
spent
a
few
hours
twice
or
three
times
a
week
in
reading
the
classics
with
the
rev
carrington
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
who
was
an
excellent
scholar
and
a
very
sensible
worthy
man
to
him
i
am
greatly
indebted
for
a
deal
of
useful
sound
information
and
a
knowledge
of
that
portion
of
mankind
with
whom
my
father
had
never
associated
now
the
rev
carrington
the
rector
of
berkeley
in
gloucestershire
took
great
pleasure
in
completing
my
education
and
at
the
end
of
one
year
with
the
advantage
of
this
friendly
assistance
i
believe
sincerely
that
i
had
acquired
more
knowledge
both
of
literature
and
of
ancient
and
modern
history
than
i
should
have
done
in
seven
years
at
college
although
my
time
was
so
much
occupied
in
the
business
of
the
farms
yet
i
longed
for
the
refined
instruction
of
the
mind
which
was
conveyed
with
so
much
kindness
with
so
much
care
and
with
so
much
assiduity
by
this
worthy
and
intelligent
man
he
was
at
that
time
denominated
by
the
vulgar
illiterate
grovelling
slaves
of
the
day
a
and
this
excellent
enlightened
being
who
possessed
more
real
love
of
country
than
a
of
the
reptiles
with
which
he
was
surrounded
was
constantly
exposed
to
the
petty
insults
of
some
of
his
neighbours
who
termed
themselves
loyal
and
constitutional
subjects
and
who
took
upon
themselves
to
point
him
out
as
an
enemy
to
his
country
because
he
did
not
choose
to
shut
his
eyes
and
join
in
the
the
savage
stupid
ideotic
cry
against
the
patriotic
efforts
that
were
then
making
by
the
friends
of
liberty
in
france
to
rescue
their
fellow
countrymen
from
the
accursed
yoke
the
double
bondage
of
superstition
and
tyranny
this
was
the
period
that
the
people
of
england
at
all
times
and
in
all
ages
esteemed
the
most
credulous
people
in
the
universe
were
made
drunk
with
their
own
ignorance
and
folly
paine
had
now
written
and
published
his
wonderful
book
his
rights
of
man
and
to
put
down
to
prevent
the
people
from
reading
to
prejudice
the
public
feeling
and
to
misrepresent
and
to
vilify
the
author
and
his
work
the
whole
power
of
this
powerful
government
was
put
in
motion
i
was
myself
at
this
time
too
young
to
take
any
active
part
in
the
proceedings
i
knew
nothing
of
politics
i
loved
my
country
and
was
taught
to
honour
my
king
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
the
violence
and
bigotry
of
faction
but
i
always
so
far
stood
by
and
gave
that
support
to
my
tutor
and
friend
as
to
demand
that
he
should
be
heard
in
his
own
defence
when
any
of
these
brutal
attacks
were
made
upon
him
by
his
assailants
my
father
was
a
loyal
but
a
man
when
he
was
present
the
parson
always
had
fair
play
my
father
would
combat
his
arguments
but
he
would
always
in
return
hear
his
reply
and
although
he
was
a
very
shrewd
intelligent
man
yet
i
generally
observed
that
carrington
had
the
best
of
the
argument
and
that
he
frequently
convinced
my
father
of
the
truth
of
his
positions
as
my
father
was
obliged
in
fairness
to
admit
the
truth
of
his
opponent
assertions
and
the
correctness
of
his
reasonings
and
the
conclusions
which
he
drew
therefrom
he
generally
finished
by
putting
in
the
plea
of
necessity
and
defending
the
government
and
measures
of
pitt
on
the
ground
of
policy
this
used
to
enrage
their
audience
which
consisted
of
the
farmers
of
the
parish
and
neighbourhood
among
whom
was
frequently
some
upstart
puppy
some
ineffable
coxcomb
one
of
their
sons
perhaps
apprenticed
at
the
neighbouring
town
who
came
home
on
a
sunday
at
easter
whitsuntide
michaelmas
or
christmas
on
a
visit
and
who
had
imbibed
a
double
portion
of
the
mania
in
consequence
of
his
having
licked
up
the
froth
and
saliva
which
had
been
vomited
forth
by
the
ministerial
agents
and
tools
of
the
rotten
borough
or
corporate
town
of
which
his
master
was
one
of
the
rotten
limbs
how
often
have
i
seen
one
of
these
cubs
with
all
the
solemn
mummery
without
half
the
sense
of
an
ape
deliver
what
the
fool
vainly
called
his
opinion
which
consisted
of
the
most
stupid
and
senseless
contradictions
and
assertions
generally
finishing
with
something
which
he
conceived
to
be
unanswerable
as
our
mayor
said
how
often
have
i
felt
my
blood
boil
to
hear
my
worthy
friend
and
preceptor
insulted
by
one
of
these
contemptible
jackanapes
in
fact
more
than
once
when
i
found
that
my
friend
the
clergyman
did
not
condescend
even
to
return
a
look
of
contempt
in
answer
to
such
despicable
trash
i
have
taken
up
the
cudgels
myself
but
being
fully
as
ignorant
of
such
matters
as
my
opponent
it
generally
followed
that
i
retorted
nothing
more
than
flat
contradictions
to
his
assertions
and
frequently
i
proposed
to
settle
the
dispute
by
an
appeal
to
force
and
sometimes
it
actually
ended
in
blows
my
worthy
friend
used
at
first
to
laugh
at
my
zeal
most
heartily
but
when
he
found
that
i
more
than
once
concluded
by
a
argument
he
begged
me
to
moderate
my
ardour
and
expostulated
with
me
upon
the
impropriety
as
well
as
the
absurdity
of
my
following
the
example
of
such
contemptible
opponents
by
falling
into
the
very
error
which
he
and
all
good
and
honest
men
must
deplore
that
of
resorting
to
brute
force
instead
of
relying
upon
truth
reason
and
justice
yet
though
i
was
warmly
his
friend
i
own
i
thought
the
parson
took
up
the
matter
too
harshly
against
the
measures
of
pitt
and
i
could
not
understand
many
of
the
grounds
of
complaint
which
he
made
against
the
proceedings
of
government
i
was
taught
to
believe
that
those
who
promoted
the
revolution
and
guillotined
the
king
of
france
were
fellows
and
that
the
people
of
this
happy
country
ought
to
do
any
thing
rather
than
submit
to
have
its
streets
stained
with
the
blood
of
their
monarch
i
was
in
the
habit
of
hearing
all
the
ridiculous
stories
of
invasion
rapine
and
murder
and
of
listening
to
all
the
hobgoblin
accounts
of
what
we
were
to
expect
from
our
fellow
creatures
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
my
young
mind
was
worked
up
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
longed
to
become
one
of
the
number
of
those
who
were
going
to
resist
and
to
punish
them
if
ever
they
dared
to
invade
our
happy
shores
nay
i
always
expressed
my
determination
if
that
day
should
ever
arrive
that
i
would
not
remain
at
home
wasting
my
time
in
inglorious
ease
and
safety
while
they
were
disfiguring
the
fair
face
of
our
favoured
isle
with
blood
and
conquest
my
father
who
had
frequently
heard
me
burst
out
in
loud
declamation
and
expressions
of
a
patriotic
feeling
of
abhorrence
and
threaten
defiance
in
case
any
attempt
at
invasion
was
made
began
to
reason
with
me
upon
this
subject
and
he
trusted
that
i
should
never
put
myself
forward
to
enter
any
of
the
volunteer
corps
as
they
were
called
adding
why
do
you
not
see
that
amongst
these
men
every
idea
of
sincere
patriotism
or
genuine
love
of
country
is
a
mere
joke
a
farce
look
round
said
he
and
you
will
find
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
persons
who
enter
these
corps
do
it
at
the
command
of
their
landlord
or
some
other
person
in
power
who
is
a
magistrate
or
the
immediate
agent
of
government
i
had
never
before
heard
my
father
talk
in
this
manner
but
our
little
friend
the
clergyman
appeared
delighted
to
think
that
he
had
made
a
convert
of
him
and
he
expressed
his
pleasure
upon
ascertaining
this
fact
by
hearing
him
talk
to
and
admonish
me
in
the
way
he
did
he
joined
in
my
father
censure
of
the
selfish
motives
and
views
of
those
exclusively
loyal
gentry
the
yeomanry
and
said
they
were
a
set
of
tools
of
the
government
who
wished
to
enslave
the
minds
as
well
as
the
bodies
of
their
fellow
countrymen
hold
hold
said
my
father
to
the
parson
you
mistake
me
if
you
think
i
am
a
convert
to
your
doctrine
i
am
a
truly
loyal
man
and
a
sincere
friend
of
the
constitution
both
in
church
and
state
and
if
i
thought
these
volunteer
corps
were
raised
for
the
sole
purpose
of
repelling
the
invasion
of
the
french
i
would
not
only
wish
my
son
to
enter
into
one
of
them
but
i
would
also
go
myself
old
as
i
am
rather
than
live
under
a
foreign
domination
my
opinion
said
he
always
has
been
that
we
ought
not
to
have
meddled
with
the
affairs
of
france
that
we
had
quite
enough
to
do
to
mind
our
own
business
and
if
we
could
only
take
care
of
our
own
concerns
and
manage
them
with
a
little
more
economy
and
do
justice
by
the
people
and
keep
our
magistrates
and
the
courts
of
law
independent
upright
and
impartial
in
their
decisions
we
need
not
dread
the
french
nor
all
the
foreigners
in
the
world
put
together
why
really
my
friend
replied
carrington
you
have
now
been
merely
repeating
that
for
which
those
whom
you
call
jacobins
have
been
contending
they
wish
for
nothing
more
than
you
have
said
we
all
ought
to
have
with
this
exception
that
they
say
that
the
only
way
to
secure
this
is
by
the
means
of
a
free
and
equal
representation
ah
said
my
father
there
the
rub
that
word
will
never
go
down
do
you
want
that
which
has
caused
the
shedding
of
so
much
blood
in
france
no
sir
said
the
parson
we
want
equal
justice
equal
political
rights
in
fact
all
we
want
and
all
that
the
people
require
to
make
them
free
and
happy
is
and
an
and
administration
of
those
which
we
shall
never
have
while
the
present
corrupt
system
lasts
however
said
the
clergyman
to
me
my
young
friend
do
nothing
hastily
but
should
you
go
into
any
of
the
yeomanry
corps
with
your
zealous
feeling
and
patriotic
love
of
country
i
fear
you
will
be
woefully
disappointed
if
you
expect
to
find
any
of
your
comrades
acting
under
a
corresponding
impulse
their
main
object
appears
to
be
to
secure
their
corn
ricks
and
to
keep
up
the
price
of
their
grain
and
their
landlords
who
are
the
officers
of
these
their
tenants
encourage
this
measure
that
they
may
be
enabled
to
pay
them
high
rents
depend
upon
it
nine
tenths
of
them
are
actuated
by
this
selfish
feeling
therefore
let
me
advise
you
to
reserve
your
disinterested
and
praiseworthy
patriotism
for
another
and
a
better
occasion
my
father
said
there
was
too
much
truth
in
our
friend
observations
and
under
this
impression
i
was
induced
to
forego
my
design
of
being
among
the
first
to
volunteer
into
one
of
these
troops
that
were
about
to
be
embodied
and
very
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
father
as
well
as
to
that
of
my
tutor
i
resolved
to
redouble
my
attention
to
the
business
of
the
farm
at
this
time
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
great
alarm
was
raised
and
propagated
all
over
the
country
of
the
introduction
of
french
principles
party
spirit
ran
high
in
every
company
and
society
a
great
portion
of
the
enlightened
part
of
the
community
protested
in
very
loud
terms
against
the
war
and
numerous
petitions
were
sent
from
various
parts
of
the
country
demanding
peace
the
debates
in
parliament
were
very
violent
and
fox
with
an
irresistible
eloquence
and
a
prophetic
voice
foretold
the
disasters
that
were
likely
to
follow
if
such
a
course
of
hostility
were
pursued
against
the
liberties
of
france
and
he
accused
the
ministers
of
making
and
continuing
the
war
for
the
purpose
of
ultimately
restoring
the
tyranny
of
the
bourbons
and
replacing
that
family
upon
the
throne
this
was
disclaimed
by
all
the
ministers
and
pitt
broadly
and
unequivocally
denied
that
they
had
any
such
intention
the
opposition
moved
to
address
the
king
to
make
peace
but
this
was
negatived
by
a
large
majority
and
war
war
eternal
war
against
french
principles
was
the
cry
which
was
resounded
by
all
the
agents
of
the
government
throughout
the
country
and
although
this
was
lamented
and
deplored
by
every
humane
thinking
rational
man
yet
such
was
the
fact
that
the
nation
was
drunk
with
the
clamour
and
particularly
the
for
they
then
truly
merited
the
degrading
appellation
church
and
king
mobs
were
the
order
of
the
day
every
honest
man
who
had
the
courage
to
express
his
opinion
was
denounced
as
a
jacobin
and
great
depredations
were
committed
in
many
parts
of
the
country
dreadful
outrages
of
this
sort
had
been
perpetrated
at
birmingham
as
far
back
as
the
year
by
the
drunken
hired
besotted
populace
destroying
the
houses
and
property
of
several
worthy
and
patriotic
and
therefore
obnoxious
individuals
at
bath
a
very
worthy
man
of
the
name
of
campbell
had
his
house
pulled
down
by
one
of
these
drunken
mobs
merely
because
he
took
in
the
courier
newspaper
published
by
the
notorious
daniel
stewart
who
was
a
violent
republican
and
who
propagated
his
principles
and
doctrines
in
that
paper
i
am
informed
that
the
who
acted
under
authority
actually
pulled
down
this
poor
fellow
house
to
the
tune
of
save
the
king
many
of
the
loyal
inhabitants
of
that
loyal
town
who
were
standing
by
looking
on
excited
them
to
persevere
by
joining
in
the
chorus
poor
campbell
was
ruined
by
the
loss
of
his
house
and
furniture
which
broke
his
heart
the
fact
of
his
taking
in
the
courier
was
understood
to
have
arisen
from
his
acquaintance
with
stewart
with
whom
he
had
been
in
the
habits
of
intimacy
when
they
were
both
journeymen
taylors
this
notorious
daniel
stewart
who
has
made
a
by
turning
his
coat
and
devoting
the
columns
of
the
courier
to
the
ministers
is
still
the
same
man
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
i
understand
from
those
who
are
his
pot
companions
that
he
is
as
violent
a
and
supporter
of
revolutionary
doctrines
over
his
cup
as
he
ever
was
to
call
such
a
miserable
creature
as
this
a
would
be
to
cast
a
greater
stigma
upon
the
word
radical
than
all
that
castlereagh
brougham
and
canning
ever
sent
forth
against
those
who
bear
it
it
is
confidently
asserted
by
those
who
profess
to
know
his
private
concerns
that
he
has
feathered
his
dirty
nest
well
and
that
as
the
best
means
of
securing
his
ill
gotten
pelf
he
has
lately
invested
it
in
the
to
the
amount
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
on
the
first
of
june
in
this
year
the
under
lord
howe
defeated
the
french
fleet
took
seven
sail
of
the
line
and
brought
them
into
spithead
and
it
was
announced
that
the
king
and
queen
and
the
royal
family
were
going
to
portsmouth
to
thank
and
to
congratulate
lord
howe
and
those
brave
officers
who
had
survived
the
dreadful
slaughter
of
the
engagement
as
the
of
a
gun
ship
of
war
was
to
be
launched
upon
the
occasion
a
great
number
of
persons
from
the
part
of
the
world
where
i
lived
which
was
about
fifty
miles
from
portsmouth
were
going
there
to
see
the
launch
and
to
witness
the
effect
of
this
bloody
battle
i
was
very
anxious
to
make
one
of
the
party
and
i
expressed
my
wish
to
my
father
with
which
he
positively
refused
to
comply
this
refusal
arose
from
some
little
misunderstanding
we
had
about
a
favourite
maid
servant
of
his
who
lived
with
us
at
the
time
to
whom
i
had
not
conducted
myself
with
all
the
attention
that
she
required
she
had
therefore
caused
that
sort
of
shyness
and
distance
between
my
father
and
me
which
rendered
my
home
not
so
pleasant
as
it
had
heretofore
been
and
indeed
exactly
the
reverse
of
what
it
had
been
in
my
poor
mother
life
time
my
father
assigned
as
a
reason
for
his
detaining
me
that
there
was
some
hay
about
and
although
this
was
of
very
trivial
moment
it
being
a
very
small
quantity
yet
he
positively
refused
to
give
his
consent
to
my
going
i
urged
my
plea
of
constant
attention
to
business
and
my
extraordinary
personal
exertions
for
several
years
past
wherein
i
had
done
more
work
than
almost
any
two
of
his
men
servants
and
i
demanded
to
know
if
he
had
ever
seen
me
neglect
his
business
or
shift
from
performing
the
severest
labour
he
admitted
that
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
me
and
that
he
did
not
require
that
i
should
work
so
hard
nay
he
added
that
so
far
from
having
any
complaint
to
make
against
me
for
not
working
he
thought
i
tasked
myself
too
much
and
that
he
was
fearful
that
i
should
injure
myself
by
such
excessive
exertions
as
he
had
frequently
witnessed
then
pray
sir
said
i
why
will
you
not
allow
me
a
little
recreation
this
small
indulgence
i
promised
i
would
return
at
the
end
of
two
days
but
all
would
not
do
i
found
that
his
favourite
maid
had
prejudiced
him
and
i
was
foolish
enough
to
hint
this
to
him
which
he
resented
very
warmly
and
gave
me
a
lecture
in
such
language
as
i
had
never
before
received
from
him
at
length
we
rose
to
very
high
words
and
the
dispute
was
of
so
serious
a
nature
that
he
almost
ordered
me
out
of
doors
it
ended
in
my
declaring
that
should
deter
from
going
to
portsmouth
and
by
his
declaring
that
if
i
did
i
should
never
enter
his
house
again
and
in
order
to
put
my
threat
of
going
out
of
my
power
he
took
which
was
already
saddled
instead
of
his
own
and
rode
out
to
the
other
farm
burning
with
rage
at
this
harsh
this
unusual
as
well
as
unjust
treatment
i
rushed
up
stairs
and
began
dressing
myself
for
the
journey
my
sister
flew
up
stairs
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
upon
her
knees
implored
me
not
to
think
of
going
i
coolly
asked
her
if
she
had
heard
what
passed
between
my
father
and
me
she
replied
that
she
had
heard
it
with
the
greatest
astonishment
and
dismay
and
that
she
had
heard
my
determination
with
the
greatest
pain
although
she
knew
too
well
the
cause
of
my
father
harshness
to
me
and
felt
most
acutely
the
reason
of
his
ill
humour
which
she
herself
had
sometimes
partaken
of
and
had
borne
in
silence
yet
she
dreaded
the
effect
of
my
leaving
home
however
all
her
expostulations
were
in
vain
had
made
my
and
that
once
done
with
me
nothing
but
death
would
have
deterred
me
from
carrying
it
into
effect
having
dressed
myself
i
saddled
my
favourite
horse
as
he
had
taken
mine
and
having
mounted
him
i
was
twenty
miles
on
my
road
to
portsmouth
in
less
than
two
hours
i
slept
with
a
friend
and
started
the
next
morning
at
four
to
ride
the
remaining
thirty
miles
in
order
to
be
there
by
eleven
which
was
the
hour
the
ship
was
to
be
launched
on
the
other
side
of
andover
i
overtook
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
neale
who
as
well
as
myself
was
also
going
to
portsmouth
to
see
the
royal
family
i
had
known
him
a
little
when
a
boy
at
school
at
andover
and
having
soon
learned
each
others
intentions
we
agreed
to
go
in
company
together
we
intended
to
have
breakfasted
at
winchester
but
we
were
too
early
all
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
inns
were
shut
and
we
passed
on
till
we
came
to
whiteflood
a
small
inn
by
the
road
side
where
we
got
good
corn
for
our
horses
and
an
excellent
breakfast
for
ourselves
we
arrived
at
gosport
about
nine
and
having
put
up
our
horses
we
crossed
to
portsmouth
about
ten
the
gates
of
the
dockyard
were
closed
and
we
were
told
that
we
were
too
late
to
be
launched
in
the
man
of
war
that
the
king
queen
and
three
or
four
of
the
princesses
were
at
the
governor
house
and
the
ship
would
be
launched
at
eleven
precisely
i
had
more
anxiety
about
being
launched
a
ship
of
war
never
having
seen
any
thing
of
the
sort
before
than
i
had
about
any
thing
therefore
i
felt
greatly
mortified
at
being
too
late
and
i
began
to
try
the
experiment
of
bribing
the
gatekeeper
who
had
positive
orders
not
to
let
any
one
pass
after
that
hour
my
friend
neale
seeing
it
in
vain
to
remain
there
took
another
course
and
said
he
would
get
a
boat
to
see
the
launch
if
he
could
not
get
into
it
but
as
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
being
in
the
ship
when
it
was
launched
i
remained
at
the
door
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
with
the
i
renewed
my
application
and
finding
that
he
began
to
relax
i
plied
him
close
and
he
soon
put
me
in
the
way
how
to
the
he
asked
if
i
did
not
know
any
one
who
lived
in
the
dock
yard
and
i
instantly
made
up
my
mind
to
say
yes
and
urged
him
to
repeat
some
of
their
names
this
he
did
and
i
was
luckily
saved
the
disgrace
of
telling
a
lie
for
the
second
person
he
named
was
an
old
of
mine
and
i
never
in
my
life
claimed
acquaintance
with
any
old
friend
with
so
much
alacrity
and
pleasure
a
half
crown
now
opened
the
gates
and
in
i
went
a
fine
sunburnt
country
youth
and
made
my
way
to
my
friend
house
as
fast
as
possible
another
check
he
was
from
home
i
then
hastened
to
the
part
where
the
majestic
prince
stood
upon
her
few
remaining
stocks
ready
at
a
moment
notice
for
the
signal
of
being
launched
into
the
watery
element
but
no
entrance
was
to
be
obtained
all
communication
was
cut
off
from
the
dock
to
the
vessel
except
by
one
step
ladder
strongly
guarded
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
principal
commissioner
who
had
gone
to
conduct
the
royal
family
to
the
sort
of
balcony
that
was
erected
to
enable
them
to
see
the
whole
of
the
launch
with
ease
and
safety
i
now
placed
myself
as
near
as
possible
to
the
foot
of
this
ladder
anxiously
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
commissioner
at
length
the
old
gentleman
arrived
dressed
in
an
admiral
uniform
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
but
although
it
was
the
first
crowd
i
had
ever
had
to
encounter
i
made
a
dash
and
forced
my
way
through
close
up
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
as
the
old
officer
ascended
i
sprang
through
the
sentinels
and
up
the
steps
and
held
him
fast
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
the
sentinels
seized
me
and
pulled
me
back
with
great
violence
held
and
down
came
the
commissioner
and
myself
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
the
old
boy
stared
and
the
sentinels
swore
but
i
held
they
endeavoured
to
release
him
and
struck
me
some
hard
blows
with
one
desperate
effort
however
i
sprang
by
the
commissioner
and
was
up
the
ladder
like
a
cat
i
was
seized
at
the
top
to
be
handed
back
again
and
as
i
was
about
to
make
a
determined
resistance
the
commissioner
came
up
and
kindly
released
me
and
after
a
gentle
reprimand
for
placing
him
in
such
danger
i
was
permitted
to
remain
on
board
and
to
be
launched
in
the
of
having
got
on
board
more
than
an
hour
after
all
other
communication
had
been
cut
off
from
her
and
i
obtained
this
gratification
in
the
presence
of
thousands
who
hailed
the
success
of
my
daring
perseverence
by
giving
me
this
was
the
first
act
of
my
life
that
gained
me
the
cheers
of
a
large
multitude
and
i
was
not
a
little
proud
of
the
compliment
i
believe
there
were
upwards
of
a
thousand
persons
on
board
and
i
was
struck
with
astonishment
at
the
stupendous
magnitude
of
a
ship
of
war
of
the
first
rate
on
the
larboard
side
of
this
magnificent
specimen
of
the
wooden
walls
of
old
england
sat
the
venerable
monarch
george
the
third
with
his
queen
and
their
fine
family
of
princesses
in
all
their
pride
and
beauty
two
or
three
of
them
at
that
time
being
remarkably
fine
young
women
i
believe
they
were
accompanied
by
one
of
the
princes
and
on
the
side
of
the
king
stood
the
victorious
hero
of
the
day
lord
howe
commonly
called
by
the
sailors
in
a
few
minutes
unknown
and
unobserved
by
me
the
signal
was
given
and
she
glided
almost
imperceptibly
from
the
stocks
into
the
middle
of
the
harbour
thus
riding
most
majestically
dignified
in
the
midst
of
applauding
and
admiring
myriads
who
hailed
her
progress
with
enthusiastic
cheers
the
king
the
queen
and
the
princesses
all
waving
their
handkerchiefs
such
was
the
beauty
of
this
launch
and
such
was
the
skill
with
which
it
was
accomplished
that
the
only
sensation
which
i
felt
was
that
the
other
ships
that
were
along
side
of
us
appeared
to
move
gently
from
us
a
boat
now
came
alongside
of
her
being
hailed
by
a
party
of
which
the
late
john
weeks
who
then
kept
the
bush
at
bristol
was
one
and
he
began
to
descend
when
a
thought
struck
me
that
as
i
was
the
last
person
except
the
commissioner
of
the
who
came
on
board
so
i
should
like
to
be
the
out
of
her
and
the
thought
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
i
put
it
in
execution
although
there
were
two
or
three
persons
going
down
the
ladder
on
the
side
of
the
ship
before
me
yet
i
made
a
spring
and
jumped
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
and
reached
the
boat
first
at
the
imminent
risk
of
swamping
her
i
did
not
get
any
cheers
for
this
but
many
a
reprimand
for
my
temerity
but
as
my
poor
father
used
at
that
time
to
say
that
it
was
a
word
and
a
blow
with
me
i
was
very
quick
in
forming
a
plan
and
when
i
had
once
made
up
my
mind
it
was
generally
executed
with
the
rapidity
of
lightening
i
returned
and
dined
at
the
fountain
inn
with
the
party
from
bath
and
bristol
and
in
the
evening
i
called
again
upon
my
old
school
fellow
whose
father
held
some
situation
and
lived
in
the
dock
yard
but
i
do
not
now
recollect
his
name
he
was
at
home
and
was
very
happy
to
see
me
and
having
introduced
me
to
his
father
mothers
and
sisters
together
with
some
friends
who
were
on
a
visit
i
drank
tea
with
them
and
being
offered
it
i
most
willingly
accepted
part
of
his
bed
a
valuable
acquisition
to
me
as
a
bed
was
not
to
be
had
either
in
or
within
ten
miles
of
portsmouth
for
love
or
money
before
i
rose
in
the
morning
my
young
friend
informed
me
that
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
i
should
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
royal
family
as
they
were
going
to
inspect
the
and
on
that
account
the
gates
were
kept
closed
that
they
might
not
be
annoyed
by
the
crowd
which
would
otherwise
have
impeded
their
progress
he
said
that
he
must
not
appear
but
he
thought
i
might
as
a
stranger
take
an
opportunity
of
getting
very
near
them
without
creating
any
particular
notice
i
took
the
hint
and
thanked
him
most
cordially
for
the
information
and
when
the
royal
party
came
round
i
joined
them
without
any
ceremony
they
were
attended
by
very
few
persons
among
whom
were
lord
howe
and
the
to
whom
i
had
caused
such
a
fall
the
day
before
the
latter
eyed
me
immediately
and
shook
his
head
but
in
such
a
good
humoured
way
that
it
encouraged
me
to
remain
rather
than
otherwise
i
therefore
now
joined
the
party
at
a
respectful
distance
at
the
entrance
of
the
cable
room
lay
a
piece
of
a
very
large
cable
about
six
feet
long
to
which
lord
howe
called
the
attention
of
the
royal
family
by
stating
that
it
was
part
of
the
cable
of
the
admiral
and
that
it
had
been
shot
off
at
that
length
by
two
balls
from
the
english
fleet
which
were
supposed
to
have
struck
it
at
the
same
moment
at
six
feet
distance
lord
howe
also
said
that
there
was
a
twelve
pounder
ball
stuck
into
it
also
but
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
and
they
could
not
see
it
he
ordered
one
of
the
attendants
to
heave
it
upon
its
end
it
was
however
too
heavy
and
the
man
could
not
accomplish
it
but
let
it
fall
back
again
the
commissioner
was
calling
some
one
to
assist
when
i
sprung
forward
and
having
seized
it
i
heaved
it
upright
in
an
instant
for
which
the
gallant
admiral
as
well
as
the
commissioner
thanked
me
and
i
held
it
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
the
king
and
all
the
family
examined
it
as
it
was
esteemed
a
great
curiosity
and
a
striking
proof
of
the
heat
and
severity
of
the
engagement
the
king
very
politely
now
thanked
me
and
the
queen
particularly
so
and
expressed
a
desire
that
some
one
should
help
me
to
sink
it
down
again
fearing
that
it
was
too
heavy
for
me
but
i
was
anxious
to
shew
my
strength
as
well
as
my
gallantry
and
i
sunk
it
into
its
place
on
the
ground
again
with
great
ease
the
princesses
deigned
a
smile
which
i
esteemed
a
very
high
reward
after
this
i
went
round
the
whole
dock
yard
with
the
party
and
offered
my
assistance
whenever
it
was
wanted
which
was
accepted
with
the
greatest
politeness
the
princesses
entering
at
times
freely
into
conversation
with
me
at
length
the
commissioner
took
me
aside
and
asked
me
how
i
came
into
the
dock
yard
i
stated
the
fact
to
him
as
it
was
and
he
then
said
he
had
his
majesty
command
to
ask
my
name
i
told
him
my
name
what
was
my
occupation
and
whence
i
came
and
the
king
hearing
that
i
was
the
son
of
a
large
wiltshire
farmer
asked
me
many
questions
relating
to
the
crops
all
of
which
i
answered
very
much
to
his
satisfaction
and
when
they
departed
he
politely
took
leave
of
me
the
reader
may
easily
conceive
that
i
was
not
a
little
proud
of
the
opportunity
i
had
of
being
so
near
and
of
having
such
means
of
conversing
with
the
royal
party
i
forgot
to
notice
that
the
of
the
ship
which
was
launched
the
day
before
had
been
got
back
again
into
dock
the
same
afternoon
and
was
this
day
exhibited
to
his
majesty
which
operation
had
been
performed
in
by
the
workmen
in
the
yard
an
instance
of
speed
and
of
the
power
of
and
incessant
labour
which
never
was
before
and
probably
never
has
since
been
equalled
in
the
annals
of
i
went
on
board
some
of
the
captured
french
ships
of
war
that
had
been
cleared
up
from
the
carnage
of
the
battle
for
the
inspection
of
the
royal
visitors
but
notwithstanding
the
care
which
had
been
taken
to
put
them
in
a
state
fit
to
be
viewed
the
visible
proofs
of
the
horrible
slaughter
met
the
eye
in
every
direction
and
the
recollection
of
the
sight
even
at
this
distance
of
time
makes
the
heart
sicken
although
i
was
at
this
time
in
the
zenith
of
my
loyalty
i
could
not
avoid
enquiring
of
myself
whether
all
this
blood
and
carnage
all
this
waste
of
valuable
life
was
absolutely
necessary
whether
no
means
could
have
been
devised
to
settle
the
point
in
dispute
without
resorting
to
arms
and
sacrificing
the
best
blood
of
both
countries
on
the
one
hand
the
too
common
feeling
was
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
and
almost
all
those
who
were
the
loudest
in
their
lamentations
and
who
appeared
most
to
deplore
the
dreadful
loss
of
so
many
gallant
men
were
at
the
same
time
the
greatest
advocates
of
the
war
and
boldly
justified
it
upon
the
score
of
dire
necessity
adding
that
it
was
better
a
few
should
suffer
in
war
than
that
the
whole
country
should
be
overrun
by
an
invading
army
which
they
would
have
us
to
believe
was
composed
of
such
monsters
as
would
never
rest
satisfied
unless
they
murdered
us
all
young
and
old
male
and
female
the
republicans
of
france
were
described
as
wild
beasts
of
the
most
ferocious
kind
whose
only
delight
was
in
blood
and
who
never
spared
either
or
but
yet
it
often
occurred
to
me
should
but
the
opinion
the
representations
of
my
worthy
friend
and
tutor
be
correct
that
not
the
french
republicans
but
those
who
supported
the
war
the
english
ministers
were
the
bloody
minded
monsters
that
they
as
he
asserted
were
the
cause
of
the
war
in
order
to
restore
the
old
tyranny
that
had
desolated
france
and
had
for
so
many
centuries
enslaved
a
brave
an
intelligent
and
a
truly
gallant
people
these
reflections
would
frequently
come
across
my
mind
but
we
were
told
they
were
threatening
to
invade
us
and
the
threat
of
an
invasion
always
roused
the
spirit
of
every
british
heart
and
made
it
glow
with
the
desire
to
repel
them
i
had
now
seen
nearly
all
the
sights
and
as
i
had
been
absent
from
home
four
days
i
began
to
bend
my
thoughts
that
way
but
the
reflection
that
i
had
left
my
father
not
only
without
his
leave
but
also
against
his
consent
now
began
to
render
every
thing
that
others
appeared
to
enjoy
very
irksome
to
me
i
however
mustered
courage
took
my
horse
and
reached
home
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
at
the
door
i
met
my
father
who
received
me
in
the
most
hostile
manner
he
lavished
his
imprecations
upon
my
head
and
as
he
burst
out
of
the
room
he
in
a
paroxysm
of
passion
ordered
me
to
quit
his
house
and
see
his
face
no
more
springing
by
me
in
a
menacing
manner
he
repeated
his
denunciations
declaring
that
i
should
not
remain
under
his
roof
he
then
went
to
the
stable
took
his
horse
which
i
had
just
brought
home
mounted
it
and
rode
away
towards
his
farms
young
and
foolish
as
i
was
i
felt
that
i
had
given
him
cause
of
just
complaint
although
i
thought
his
conduct
displayed
an
unnecessary
and
unbecoming
rigour
in
refusing
me
such
an
indulgence
in
the
first
instance
my
eldest
sister
implored
me
to
endeavour
to
conciliate
my
father
and
informed
me
how
uneasy
he
had
been
since
my
first
departure
and
what
a
wretched
house
they
had
had
at
home
but
his
determined
aspect
at
leaving
me
the
threats
which
he
held
out
and
the
peremptory
tone
in
which
he
ordered
me
to
depart
from
his
house
appeared
to
me
to
admit
of
no
alternative
and
therefore
with
a
desperate
determination
i
hastened
up
stairs
and
packed
up
a
small
portmanteau
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
my
sister
i
was
mounted
upon
my
own
horse
and
took
a
final
leave
as
i
expected
of
that
home
where
i
had
passed
so
many
delightful
happy
days
as
i
embraced
my
afflicted
sister
who
had
fainted
upon
seeing
my
determination
and
who
was
now
relieved
by
a
flood
of
tears
i
could
not
refrain
from
calling
aloud
upon
the
angelic
spirit
of
my
dear
departed
mother
who
had
she
been
alive
this
dreadful
calamity
had
never
befallen
me
or
our
family
i
tore
myself
from
my
sister
who
was
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
who
now
upon
her
knees
implored
me
to
think
of
my
father
and
how
miserable
my
leaving
home
again
under
such
distressing
circumstances
would
make
him
she
used
all
the
arguments
which
her
reason
could
suggest
to
persuade
me
that
it
was
my
duty
to
bear
with
his
temper
and
to
submit
to
his
will
however
arbitrary
but
as
i
was
now
of
age
and
as
i
had
laboured
incessantly
in
my
father
business
for
nearly
five
years
and
had
scarcely
ever
left
it
for
a
day
i
was
mortified
at
his
unnecessary
severity
in
denying
me
the
privilege
of
a
day
or
two
upon
such
an
occasion
and
besides
as
my
father
temper
was
very
much
altered
since
the
death
of
my
mother
and
my
home
was
become
not
at
all
comfortable
of
late
i
was
unfortunately
not
in
the
humour
to
brook
such
harsh
treatment
nor
indeed
did
i
know
how
it
was
possible
for
me
to
remain
after
his
determined
behaviour
at
quitting
me
i
therefore
most
unwisely
and
most
imprudently
started
off
as
i
thought
to
seek
my
fortune
determined
at
all
events
if
i
could
not
live
in
my
father
house
that
i
would
leave
the
kingdom
i
rode
to
bath
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
in
about
three
hours
whence
having
baited
my
horse
i
rode
forward
to
bristol
where
i
arrived
and
put
up
at
the
in
about
eight
having
ridden
from
portsmouth
to
bristol
a
distance
of
ninety
five
miles
in
about
thirteen
hours
i
was
not
known
to
any
one
at
the
inn
nor
to
any
one
in
bristol
except
a
gresley
of
whom
my
father
rented
littlecot
farm
i
found
him
out
immediately
and
he
received
me
with
great
kindness
expressing
himself
most
happy
to
see
me
as
he
had
repeatedly
given
me
invitations
to
come
and
visit
him
i
carefully
concealed
the
rupture
with
my
father
and
very
luckily
for
me
i
was
in
very
good
hands
as
my
friend
although
an
easy
voluptuary
was
nevertheless
an
amiable
and
a
man
and
took
care
to
check
instead
of
encouraging
me
in
any
soft
of
debauchery
which
a
youth
of
my
age
was
so
likely
to
fall
into
in
such
a
profligate
city
i
began
the
very
next
day
to
look
out
for
some
situation
amongst
the
captains
of
vessels
outward
bound
and
i
was
soon
introduced
to
a
very
worthy
man
a
friend
of
gresley
who
in
the
course
of
ten
days
was
about
to
sail
to
africa
in
the
command
of
a
vessel
upon
the
slave
trade
i
soon
imparted
to
him
my
wish
to
go
abroad
in
some
active
situation
but
i
bound
him
to
secrecy
even
with
my
friend
gresley
he
professed
to
be
very
much
pleased
with
me
but
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
prevail
upon
me
to
abandon
my
design
and
he
pointed
out
to
me
in
very
glowing
colours
all
the
miseries
and
all
the
perils
which
were
incident
to
a
life
and
did
every
thing
that
he
possibly
could
to
persuade
me
to
return
to
my
father
house
at
length
i
told
him
that
i
was
irrevocably
determined
to
look
out
for
a
situation
and
to
close
with
the
first
captain
who
would
give
me
a
birth
and
the
longer
the
voyage
the
better
i
should
be
pleased
with
it
for
i
was
resolved
upon
leaving
england
as
i
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
remaining
in
this
country
and
an
alien
from
the
house
of
my
father
at
last
after
he
had
ascertained
that
i
was
immutably
resolved
to
go
to
sea
he
at
once
made
me
an
offer
of
taking
me
out
as
his
and
cabin
i
jumped
at
the
offer
but
told
him
that
i
had
but
little
money
and
was
perhaps
ill
prepared
for
such
a
voyage
he
then
made
one
more
trial
to
prevail
upon
me
to
return
but
with
as
little
success
as
before
finding
that
it
was
in
vain
to
reason
any
further
he
then
said
that
be
would
equip
me
the
next
morning
at
his
own
expense
with
all
the
necessary
clothing
for
the
voyage
and
he
added
that
if
he
were
successful
of
which
he
had
no
doubt
he
would
pay
me
something
handsome
for
my
services
which
he
anticipated
would
be
very
valuable
to
him
the
morning
came
without
my
having
closed
my
eyes
i
having
been
entirely
occupied
the
whole
of
the
night
with
the
thoughts
of
my
undertaking
to
which
i
looked
forward
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
regardless
of
the
atrocious
occupation
upon
which
i
was
about
to
enter
in
fact
it
did
not
once
occur
to
me
that
the
slave
trade
was
any
worse
than
any
other
trade
so
little
had
i
thought
upon
it
and
so
little
did
i
know
of
the
nature
of
it
at
that
time
thousands
being
engaged
in
it
who
were
protected
by
the
laws
it
never
came
into
my
head
that
i
was
about
to
commit
any
moral
crime
indeed
i
was
driven
to
such
a
state
of
desperation
by
the
quarrel
which
i
had
had
with
my
father
and
was
so
indignant
at
what
i
thought
his
cruel
treatment
that
i
was
a
fit
subject
for
any
enterprise
even
had
it
been
ten
times
more
desperate
than
that
in
which
i
was
about
to
engage
and
having
once
made
up
my
mind
to
the
thing
i
thought
of
nothing
else
till
my
trunk
of
clothes
was
ready
and
on
board
that
being
effected
i
went
down
with
the
captain
and
took
possession
of
my
cabin
and
birth
in
the
vessel
which
lay
off
and
as
she
was
ready
to
sail
with
the
first
fair
wind
i
should
have
staid
on
board
had
not
the
captain
insisted
upon
my
taking
leave
of
gresley
and
sending
my
horse
back
to
my
father
although
i
considered
the
horse
as
my
own
and
had
been
offered
thirty
guineas
for
him
yet
such
was
the
liberality
and
proper
feeling
of
the
captain
that
he
absolutely
refused
to
take
me
unless
i
returned
the
horse
and
i
consequently
in
his
presence
hired
a
man
to
take
him
off
the
next
morning
i
was
to
see
gresley
by
appointment
at
the
white
lion
at
nine
that
evening
and
was
to
go
down
with
the
captain
at
eight
the
next
day
to
the
vessel
which
was
to
weigh
anchor
at
ten
and
drop
down
the
bristol
channel
with
the
tide
the
wind
being
fair
we
expected
to
be
off
ilfracombe
the
same
night
every
thing
was
arranged
i
had
written
home
and
taken
leave
of
my
father
and
my
sister
lamenting
the
cause
but
rejoicing
in
the
prospect
of
my
voyage
i
had
drank
tea
with
the
captain
and
was
anxiously
waiting
the
arrival
of
our
mutual
friend
gresley
to
break
the
affair
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
to
take
leave
of
him
when
the
waiter
announced
a
gentleman
enquiring
for
hunt
i
rose
to
receive
as
i
supposed
my
friend
gresley
and
was
prepared
to
give
him
a
brief
explanation
of
my
intentions
when
lo
who
should
walk
in
but
an
intimate
friend
of
my
father
who
had
just
arrived
in
his
own
carriage
from
bath
in
search
of
the
fugitive
he
immediately
produced
a
letter
from
my
father
not
only
inviting
my
return
home
not
only
promising
forgiveness
to
me
but
actually
intreating
forgiveness
for
his
harshness
towards
me
and
imploring
me
to
hasten
home
and
relieve
him
from
the
terrible
state
of
misery
to
which
my
absence
had
reduced
him
the
language
of
his
letter
was
such
as
would
have
melted
the
heart
of
a
much
more
hardened
offender
than
i
was
but
i
had
made
an
engagement
with
the
captain
and
i
told
my
father
friend
that
i
was
sorry
that
he
was
come
too
late
but
that
no
consideration
whatever
should
make
me
run
from
the
engagement
which
i
had
contracted
with
him
at
my
own
particular
request
it
is
true
that
i
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
embrace
my
beloved
father
again
that
to
be
restored
to
his
good
opinion
was
a
treasure
to
me
far
surpassing
all
and
every
prospect
that
my
sanguine
hopes
had
painted
in
the
most
vivid
colours
upon
my
enthusiastic
imagination
and
that
i
felt
for
a
moment
a
struggle
between
and
yet
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
relate
it
but
the
truth
must
be
told
that
i
instantly
declared
that
as
i
had
gone
so
far
no
power
on
earth
should
deter
me
from
fulfilling
my
engagement
with
captain
this
worthy
and
disinterested
fellow
however
instantly
protested
that
under
such
circumstances
with
such
a
prospect
of
my
being
restored
to
my
family
and
friends
nothing
in
the
world
should
induce
him
to
take
me
with
him
at
this
moment
my
friend
gresley
arrived
and
heard
from
the
captain
and
my
father
friend
my
obstinate
resolve
with
the
greatest
astonishment
he
assured
me
that
unless
i
instantly
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
going
he
would
get
a
warrant
from
his
friend
the
mayor
to
detain
me
by
force
this
was
however
unnecessary
for
after
the
captain
generous
and
manly
avowal
i
yielded
without
farther
delay
to
the
earnest
entreaties
of
all
present
and
i
believe
that
the
worthy
captain
felt
as
much
real
delight
and
happiness
at
the
result
as
anyone
of
the
party
my
friend
offered
to
pay
the
captain
for
any
expence
that
he
had
been
put
to
on
my
account
but
the
latter
positively
refused
to
take
a
farthing
adding
that
he
should
sell
what
he
had
provided
for
me
for
two
hundred
per
cent
profit
and
that
he
would
rather
lose
two
hundred
per
cent
than
forego
the
pleasure
he
felt
at
the
idea
of
a
reconciliation
between
his
young
friend
and
his
father
the
kindness
of
my
father
letter
had
a
great
effect
upon
me
the
expressions
of
sorrow
which
it
contained
at
my
departure
and
the
assurance
that
he
would
be
completely
miserable
till
my
return
recalled
all
his
former
kindness
to
me
and
i
would
instantly
have
set
out
on
my
way
home
although
it
was
now
dusk
and
it
rained
in
torrents
i
had
already
ordered
my
horse
to
be
saddled
that
horse
which
i
had
the
same
evening
paid
a
man
twelve
shillings
to
take
back
to
my
father
house
without
his
master
i
was
now
eager
to
mount
myself
that
i
might
fly
to
receive
my
parent
blessing
and
acknowledge
my
error
in
disobeying
his
commands
but
my
friends
all
entreated
me
to
defer
my
departure
till
the
morning
to
which
i
reluctantly
consented
and
retired
to
bed
about
twelve
after
having
taken
a
most
affectionate
leave
of
the
generous
and
good
god
how
often
have
i
been
since
rivetted
to
the
earth
as
it
were
with
astonishment
when
i
contemplated
such
a
man
being
employed
upon
such
a
cruel
unjust
unchristian
murderous
traffic
as
that
of
the
i
certainly
retired
to
my
bed
having
ordered
the
ostler
to
get
my
horse
ready
by
three
but
no
rest
did
i
obtain
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
now
learned
what
it
was
to
go
to
bed
without
being
able
to
go
to
sleep
for
two
long
hours
i
tossed
and
turned
about
a
thousand
times
but
deep
had
flown
from
my
eyes
i
heard
the
quarters
strike
and
the
watchman
go
his
lonely
round
my
thoughts
were
all
at
home
and
i
was
wretched
till
i
threw
myself
at
my
poor
distressed
father
feet
to
claim
with
a
certainty
of
receiving
his
blessing
and
forgiveness
i
who
but
a
few
hours
before
expected
and
intended
to
bid
farewell
to
my
native
land
and
to
leave
behind
me
all
that
was
dear
and
valuable
to
me
in
this
world
i
who
was
prepared
to
sail
the
next
morning
almost
without
regret
and
had
thoughtlessly
undertaken
to
become
one
of
those
who
were
the
most
horrid
and
most
unnatural
of
all
unnatural
and
horrid
thieves
and
murderers
i
who
should
have
gone
to
bed
and
slept
as
sound
as
a
rock
under
such
circumstances
till
i
was
called
in
the
morning
could
not
now
i
was
about
to
return
to
my
kindest
friends
and
to
make
myself
and
my
father
happy
i
could
not
sleep
one
moment
gracious
god
upon
what
a
precipice
had
i
stood
from
what
a
world
of
misery
was
i
rescued
by
the
kind
hand
of
providence
for
if
i
had
gone
upon
such
an
errand
and
if
i
had
been
instrumental
in
robbing
one
being
or
fellow
of
his
life
or
of
what
was
more
valuable
to
him
his
liberty
it
would
afterwards
have
been
to
me
a
source
of
misery
thank
god
i
was
saved
from
that
pang
had
my
father
messenger
come
twelve
hours
later
i
should
have
been
sailed
and
in
all
probability
have
been
a
participator
in
such
crimes
as
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
for
having
joined
in
committing
the
clock
struck
two
i
could
remain
in
bed
no
longer
i
jumped
up
and
having
found
my
way
into
the
yard
i
roused
the
ostler
and
having
got
my
horse
saddled
i
passed
temple
gate
just
as
the
clock
struck
three
and
without
drawing
bit
more
than
once
i
reached
home
before
nine
a
distance
of
miles
my
father
and
my
sister
met
me
at
the
door
but
to
attempt
to
describe
the
affecting
reconciliation
would
be
only
doing
an
injustice
to
my
own
feelings
my
poor
father
however
would
scarcely
allow
me
to
offer
any
apology
for
my
undutiful
behaviour
he
took
all
the
blame
to
himself
he
had
reflected
more
than
i
had
upon
the
consequences
of
my
voyage
the
full
particulars
of
which
i
found
he
knew
he
having
received
an
account
of
my
every
movement
and
known
all
my
plans
which
had
in
confidence
been
communicated
by
the
honest
captain
to
gresley
that
he
might
apprise
my
father
of
them
and
endeavour
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
to
procure
for
me
if
possible
a
reconciliation
before
he
sailed
he
being
resolved
to
convince
himself
that
all
hopes
of
that
desirable
object
were
fruitless
ere
he
permitted
me
to
accompany
him
this
was
an
instance
of
the
most
disinterested
friendship
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
even
delayed
the
sailing
of
the
vessel
for
several
days
in
order
to
give
time
for
gresley
to
send
to
my
father
this
information
gresley
communicated
without
delay
and
my
father
no
sooner
received
it
than
he
dispatched
a
confidential
messenger
his
neighbour
john
coward
of
enford
with
a
strict
injunction
not
to
spare
any
pains
to
find
me
and
to
hasten
my
return
home
my
father
who
had
hitherto
since
the
death
of
my
mother
conducted
himself
towards
me
with
a
degree
of
austerity
and
rigid
discipline
not
altogether
calculated
to
conciliate
my
hasty
disposition
now
relaxed
his
usual
strictness
and
ever
afterwards
proved
himself
not
only
a
kind
parent
but
an
indulgent
and
sincere
he
lamented
upon
this
occasion
the
severe
loss
of
my
mother
in
which
i
most
heartily
joined
for
we
both
attributed
the
late
dispute
and
separation
to
the
want
of
an
amiable
mediator
which
if
my
poor
mother
had
been
alive
she
would
have
been
upon
this
as
she
had
been
in
many
former
instances
in
which
she
had
been
of
the
greatest
utility
and
benefit
as
a
and
promoter
of
family
happiness
and
concord
my
father
who
had
long
since
witnessed
with
some
anxiety
my
aspiring
disposition
now
began
to
dread
the
evil
consequences
of
those
lofty
notions
of
patriotism
and
that
disinterested
love
of
country
which
in
my
earlier
years
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
instil
into
my
young
mind
and
had
been
so
anxious
that
i
should
imbibe
he
now
viewed
my
daring
spirit
with
a
mingled
pleasure
and
pain
he
dreaded
the
result
of
such
ardent
feelings
because
he
foresaw
that
they
would
lead
me
into
the
greatest
difficulties
and
dangers
unless
he
checked
them
by
timely
control
he
now
freely
told
me
that
he
was
actuated
by
this
motive
when
he
refused
to
give
me
his
consent
to
go
to
portsmouth
to
witness
the
effects
of
lord
howe
brilliant
victory
over
the
french
fleet
he
told
me
too
that
he
had
the
same
object
in
view
when
the
summer
before
he
refused
my
application
to
go
and
see
the
grand
review
on
bagshot
heath
it
was
however
at
too
late
a
period
that
he
began
to
check
my
patriotic
ardour
he
had
himself
bent
the
twig
and
it
had
grown
too
powerfully
in
the
direction
which
he
had
given
to
it
to
be
directed
to
any
other
although
i
was
no
politician
at
that
time
yet
my
bosom
glowed
with
as
sacred
a
love
of
country
with
as
strong
a
predilection
for
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people
with
as
pure
disinterested
love
of
truth
and
justice
as
ever
warmed
the
youthful
heart
of
yet
notwithstanding
i
was
a
loyal
man
to
the
backbone
i
never
joined
in
or
approved
of
the
persecution
of
any
one
for
holding
opinions
different
from
those
which
i
myself
openly
professed
i
knew
many
persons
who
were
called
at
this
time
and
although
i
thought
them
violent
in
their
principles
and
professions
yet
i
never
quarrelled
with
any
of
them
upon
the
score
of
opinion
i
was
always
the
first
to
stand
forward
to
protect
the
oppressed
and
i
began
sincerely
to
sympathise
with
the
labouring
poor
i
had
now
for
some
years
worked
with
them
side
by
side
day
by
day
week
by
week
month
by
month
and
year
year
by
year
i
had
toiled
in
the
field
with
the
labourers
of
my
father
i
had
heard
their
complaints
i
had
witnessed
their
increasing
privations
and
although
i
often
checked
the
ebullition
of
their
discontent
which
i
sometimes
attributed
to
disaffection
yet
i
never
mocked
their
misery
i
never
persecuted
or
oppressed
any
one
because
he
was
considered
a
disaffected
person
or
what
was
a
synonymous
term
a
jacobin
in
fact
i
sometimes
got
myself
into
very
disagreeable
situations
for
expressing
my
love
of
fair
play
once
in
particular
i
remember
i
was
in
the
boxes
at
the
theatre
at
salisbury
when
there
was
a
violent
party
call
for
god
save
the
king
i
was
one
of
the
loyal
who
as
loudly
demanded
this
tune
to
be
played
as
any
loyal
man
in
the
house
after
some
trifling
opposition
the
call
was
complied
with
and
the
performers
came
forward
upon
the
stage
and
sung
it
there
was
then
a
call
for
hats
off
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
was
as
zealous
in
this
call
as
any
one
because
in
the
first
place
i
really
was
a
loyal
man
and
i
was
in
the
side
boxes
with
a
very
loyal
party
there
was
however
one
person
in
the
centre
of
the
front
row
of
the
pit
who
kept
his
hat
on
and
steadily
refused
to
pull
it
off
this
caused
a
great
uproar
and
a
general
call
to
turn
him
out
at
length
some
persons
near
him
attempted
to
pull
his
hat
off
by
force
but
he
defended
himself
for
some
time
with
great
success
and
kept
his
hat
still
on
his
head
by
this
time
the
national
air
was
finished
but
still
there
was
a
call
to
pull
his
hat
off
and
to
turn
him
out
he
was
surrounded
now
by
numbers
who
urged
on
by
those
in
the
boxes
not
only
forcibly
deprived
him
of
his
hat
but
likewise
began
to
use
him
ill
i
was
now
as
loud
in
my
demand
for
as
i
had
been
previously
for
hats
off
they
still
persisted
in
their
endeavour
to
turn
him
out
which
he
as
manfully
resisted
although
he
was
surrounded
with
a
host
of
foes
without
any
one
not
even
his
friends
who
were
with
him
offering
to
give
any
assistance
i
cried
shame
shame
shame
as
loud
as
i
could
and
demanded
fair
play
he
had
by
this
time
at
least
a
dozen
assailing
him
at
once
and
they
had
actually
got
him
upon
the
spikes
of
the
orchestra
with
an
intention
to
throw
him
over
out
of
the
pit
among
the
musicians
i
felt
enraged
and
indignant
at
such
unmanly
conduct
and
at
length
i
sprung
out
of
the
box
into
the
pit
and
having
rushed
up
to
him
i
dealt
the
cowardly
crew
that
were
attacking
him
some
heavy
falls
and
soon
cleared
off
the
gang
so
that
the
person
whom
they
had
literally
got
hanging
upon
the
spikes
was
enabled
to
extricate
himself
in
effecting
this
i
received
as
well
as
gave
many
severe
blows
and
by
some
i
was
considered
as
very
foolish
for
interfering
while
all
the
loyal
loudly
blamed
me
for
preventing
his
being
turned
out
although
i
very
much
disapproved
of
the
gentleman
taste
and
stubbornness
yet
i
could
not
look
on
and
see
a
fellow
man
for
expressing
his
opinion
because
that
opinion
was
contrary
to
my
own
sentiments
however
the
play
now
proceeded
and
the
gentleman
mr
john
axford
of
eastcot
was
allowed
to
keep
his
seat
and
his
hat
on
uninterrupted
to
the
end
of
the
performance
in
consequence
of
this
circumstance
i
afterwards
became
very
intimate
with
axford
who
was
very
grateful
for
my
assistance
and
i
although
i
disapproved
of
his
politics
could
not
but
admire
his
independent
spirit
he
was
a
man
of
a
most
amiable
character
much
intelligence
and
a
quick
penetration
a
great
reader
of
the
political
history
of
this
and
the
neighbouring
countries
he
possessed
the
most
retentive
memory
and
could
repeat
almost
all
that
he
read
of
the
french
revolution
and
of
paine
rights
of
man
he
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
and
a
determined
enemy
to
the
war
that
england
was
carrying
on
against
the
people
of
france
in
fact
he
was
a
lover
of
truth
justice
and
liberty
and
therefore
was
of
course
denominated
a
jacobin
he
lived
and
died
railing
against
the
unjust
and
unnecessary
war
which
the
ministers
of
england
were
waging
against
liberty
in
france
and
as
he
was
a
warm
admirer
of
fox
he
entered
into
almost
all
his
views
and
joined
him
in
forcibly
predicting
all
that
has
since
occurred
as
to
the
ruin
of
the
country
by
debt
and
insupportable
taxation
he
was
indeed
a
spirited
and
enlightened
advocate
of
genuine
freedom
and
he
never
failed
even
in
the
worst
of
times
publicly
to
avow
his
sentiments
he
certainly
possessed
more
real
political
knowledge
and
a
more
correct
knowledge
of
the
situation
and
the
affairs
of
the
country
than
any
man
with
whom
i
have
ever
met
with
the
exception
of
cobbett
although
i
knew
him
for
many
years
before
i
concurred
in
his
sentiments
yet
i
found
him
a
sincere
friend
and
a
most
intelligent
companion
and
his
death
was
lamented
more
by
me
than
that
of
any
political
acquaintance
i
ever
had
he
died
before
i
was
much
of
a
politician
and
before
i
appeared
much
in
public
life
but
from
him
i
learned
much
which
i
have
never
forgotten
and
which
has
been
and
ever
will
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
me
as
a
public
man
were
i
not
to
pay
this
tribute
to
his
memory
i
should
prove
myself
to
have
been
unworthy
of
his
friendship
and
undeserving
of
my
own
approbation
he
was
always
denounced
as
a
jacobin
by
the
ignorant
and
by
the
interested
sycophants
of
the
day
but
his
merit
and
his
public
spirit
were
duly
estimated
by
all
good
and
impartial
men
that
knew
him
and
by
no
one
more
than
by
the
the
marquis
of
lansdown
with
whom
he
was
particularly
intimate
at
this
period
the
whole
country
was
greatly
agitated
with
political
discussions
every
one
having
an
eye
upon
the
bloody
and
ferocious
proceedings
committed
under
the
tyranny
of
robespierre
in
paris
this
caused
great
alarm
in
england
for
fear
of
the
progress
of
french
principles
and
all
the
alarmists
rallied
round
the
pitt
administration
and
war
war
eternal
war
against
french
principles
was
the
of
the
day
the
parliament
met
in
january
and
the
enormous
supplies
were
granted
almost
without
any
opposition
eighty
thousand
men
were
voted
for
the
sea
forty
thousand
for
the
and
likewise
one
hundred
thousand
militia
and
forty
thousand
subsidised
germans
the
estimates
for
this
service
amounted
to
nineteen
millions
in
order
to
keep
the
people
in
good
humour
and
to
make
them
submit
to
pay
the
enormous
increase
of
taxation
the
threat
of
invasion
was
held
out
and
described
with
all
its
horrors
as
being
about
to
be
realised
this
set
the
john
bulls
and
like
men
they
were
ready
to
swallow
any
thing
that
the
minister
of
the
day
prescribed
voluntary
contributions
and
volunteer
corps
were
raised
all
over
the
country
in
the
mean
time
pitt
who
had
deserted
the
cause
of
reform
of
which
previous
to
his
coming
into
power
he
had
been
one
of
the
warmest
and
most
zealous
advocates
true
took
care
to
presecute
all
his
former
associates
who
were
too
honest
to
abandon
that
cause
which
he
had
betrayed
in
scotland
that
excellent
and
worthy
man
maurice
margarot
and
others
were
transported
for
fourteen
years
for
having
been
members
of
the
british
convention
thos
walker
of
manchester
was
tried
on
a
false
accusation
of
high
treason
at
lancaster
but
was
honourably
acquitted
messrs
hardy
tooke
joyce
and
thelwall
were
also
indicted
and
tried
upon
a
pretended
charge
of
high
treason
at
the
old
bailey
in
london
but
this
premeditated
attempt
of
the
ministers
to
destroy
these
innocent
men
their
political
opponents
by
setting
on
the
plea
of
constructive
treason
was
frustrated
by
the
verdict
of
an
honest
london
jury
tooke
and
thelwall
were
very
able
and
perhaps
the
most
powerful
advocates
of
liberty
in
england
at
that
time
and
the
ministers
of
the
day
might
with
some
men
have
justified
the
attempt
to
destroy
such
enemies
upon
the
score
of
state
policy
but
their
attempt
upon
poor
hardy
who
was
a
simple
inoffensive
harmless
plodding
shoemaker
possessing
neither
talent
influence
nor
the
smallest
power
to
do
them
any
harm
whatever
this
was
a
proof
of
the
vindictive
and
bloody
intentions
of
the
men
in
office
and
it
caused
a
great
sensation
throughout
the
country
and
the
verdicts
of
the
jury
were
hailed
with
pleasure
by
every
honest
thinking
man
in
the
kingdom
who
was
not
under
the
influence
of
an
unjust
prejudice
the
reign
of
terror
was
now
proclaimed
and
a
great
number
of
worthy
men
were
imprisoned
in
dungeons
under
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
which
tyrannical
proceeding
greatly
agitated
the
whole
country
this
therefore
will
not
be
an
improper
place
to
record
and
bring
to
the
recollection
of
the
public
were
the
men
in
power
under
and
by
whose
directions
these
acts
were
perpetrated
against
the
lives
and
liberties
of
the
people
and
particularly
against
those
who
with
patriotic
energy
opposed
those
measures
which
they
foretold
with
a
prophetic
warning
voice
would
bring
this
country
to
that
wretched
state
of
poverty
and
slavery
to
which
it
is
now
reduced
although
i
was
too
young
at
that
time
to
be
much
of
a
politician
and
did
not
enter
publicly
into
any
of
the
measures
for
or
against
these
proceedings
yet
as
i
shall
henceforward
record
the
particular
political
occurrences
of
each
succeeding
year
i
shall
also
take
care
to
put
upon
record
the
names
of
those
who
were
at
the
head
of
the
administration
and
who
took
a
prominent
part
in
carrying
them
into
execution
pitt
may
be
truly
said
to
have
been
the
ruler
of
the
destinies
of
this
mighty
kingdom
and
by
means
of
british
gold
and
british
blood
he
ruled
also
the
destinies
of
europe
he
was
the
administration
of
he
is
gone
but
there
are
some
who
are
still
alive
and
who
i
hope
will
live
long
enough
to
be
brought
to
justice
and
to
answer
for
the
share
they
had
in
committing
these
atrocities
upon
the
people
during
these
times
lord
grenville
was
secretary
of
state
the
hon
henry
addington
now
lord
sidmouth
was
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
sir
john
scott
now
lord
eldon
was
attorney
general
and
conducted
these
prosecutions
in
such
a
way
as
led
to
his
promotion
to
be
lord
high
chancellor
of
england
where
he
has
made
such
an
immense
sum
of
money
and
accumulated
such
a
princely
fortune
in
the
early
part
of
this
year
the
marriage
of
the
duke
of
sussex
with
lady
augusta
murray
was
made
public
which
caused
a
great
noise
in
the
country
during
all
these
eventful
transactions
i
was
labouring
incessantly
in
my
vocation
as
a
farmer
and
i
was
now
become
a
complete
master
of
every
branch
of
the
profession
there
being
no
part
of
it
that
i
had
not
performed
with
my
own
hands
perhaps
to
speak
of
my
personal
exertions
in
this
way
may
be
deemed
by
many
superfluous
but
on
reflection
they
will
i
hope
not
consider
this
to
be
the
case
hundreds
who
are
now
living
were
of
what
i
may
almost
call
the
prodigies
of
strength
and
personal
labour
performed
by
myself
and
some
of
my
father
servants
and
i
shall
merely
mention
a
few
of
the
circumstances
to
shew
the
reader
that
in
every
thing
i
undertook
i
always
performed
it
with
such
an
enthusiasm
and
determined
perseverance
that
nothing
could
resist
the
accomplishment
of
my
undertakings
my
father
encouraged
this
desire
that
i
evinced
to
excel
and
to
perform
unexampled
deeds
of
labour
and
feats
of
strength
although
he
frequently
expressed
his
fears
that
i
should
injure
myself
by
too
great
bodily
exertion
and
by
too
frequently
straining
my
muscular
powers
to
their
utmost
stretch
i
had
undertaken
and
performed
every
species
of
labour
connected
with
a
very
large
farming
business
i
had
sown
more
acres
of
ground
with
corn
in
one
day
than
any
other
man
i
had
thrashed
three
quarters
of
barley
each
succeeding
day
for
a
fortnight
together
and
that
too
at
a
time
when
some
of
the
servants
complained
of
the
difficulty
of
thrashing
one
quarter
per
day
i
had
pitched
more
loads
of
corn
in
a
day
than
had
ever
been
recorded
of
any
other
person
in
fact
my
father
confessed
that
i
got
more
work
performed
by
the
same
number
of
hands
than
he
ever
did
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
for
this
was
admitting
a
great
deal
i
did
this
by
good
words
and
kindness
towards
my
fellow
labourers
by
always
animating
and
cheering
them
on
with
my
example
by
always
placing
myself
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
by
taking
the
most
difficult
and
most
laborious
part
i
always
began
every
work
by
saying
to
those
around
me
come
let
us
do
this
or
let
us
do
that
instead
of
go
do
this
or
do
that
my
poor
father
always
observed
that
it
entirely
depended
upon
which
of
these
little
monosyllables
come
or
go
was
made
use
of
whether
the
work
was
done
well
or
ill
expeditiously
or
dilatorily
when
any
particular
work
was
doing
my
father
servants
were
always
in
the
field
and
the
job
was
begun
before
those
of
our
neighbours
had
yet
left
their
homes
and
in
changeable
weather
we
had
frequently
carried
our
hay
or
corn
and
finished
the
rick
or
stack
before
the
rain
came
on
while
others
had
yet
scarcely
begun
and
were
caught
by
the
rain
in
the
worst
situation
possible
i
have
frequently
in
the
harvest
time
when
we
anticipated
rain
been
up
and
a
mile
out
in
the
field
pitching
the
first
load
of
wheat
by
two
or
before
three
in
the
morning
while
the
carters
were
harnessing
and
bringing
out
the
other
teams
while
this
load
was
being
drawn
home
i
had
got
my
breakfast
and
was
ready
to
begin
laying
the
first
sheaf
of
the
which
many
times
i
had
finished
though
consisting
of
thirty
large
loads
of
sheaves
before
the
middle
of
the
day
by
which
means
if
the
rain
came
we
had
secured
perhaps
one
hundred
sacks
of
wheat
and
these
would
prove
worth
from
five
to
ten
shillings
a
sack
more
than
that
which
was
left
out
to
take
the
rain
if
it
proved
a
false
alarm
and
the
weather
was
fine
we
got
a
second
rick
finished
by
night
and
thereby
had
secured
two
hundred
instead
of
one
hundred
sacks
of
wheat
in
one
day
it
will
be
asked
by
some
how
did
the
labourers
relish
this
extra
toil
and
double
work
the
answer
is
easy
perfectly
well
i
always
took
care
to
have
them
amply
rewarded
in
proportion
to
their
exertions
and
i
never
failed
to
add
something
besides
good
words
and
kind
treatment
for
the
cheerfulness
and
alacrity
with
which
they
approached
and
performed
the
task
i
always
made
the
and
i
have
many
times
made
two
ricks
containing
thirty
loads
in
each
rick
in
one
day
this
work
of
making
in
very
hot
weather
which
is
generally
the
case
is
much
the
hardest
and
most
severe
work
if
done
well
belonging
to
the
farming
business
and
i
was
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
this
that
i
always
allowed
the
person
who
afterwards
made
my
a
pint
of
ale
as
often
during
the
day
as
he
chose
to
ask
for
it
for
many
years
had
i
now
made
all
my
ricks
of
hay
and
corn
and
the
were
the
admiration
of
the
whole
country
i
also
thatched
many
of
them
that
is
i
made
the
ricks
by
day
and
i
frequently
thatched
them
by
night
or
at
least
before
the
common
labourers
came
to
work
in
the
morning
i
was
never
tired
of
labour
and
active
exertions
and
at
this
period
the
labourers
possessed
all
the
strength
and
vigour
of
the
english
peasantry
of
former
days
notwithstanding
they
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
war
and
to
suffer
some
privations
in
consequence
of
the
rise
of
price
in
provisions
caused
by
the
increase
of
taxation
they
had
yet
a
barrel
of
good
beer
to
go
to
in
and
harvest
time
and
the
young
men
at
least
could
gain
a
comfortable
subsistence
of
the
necessaries
of
life
by
their
daily
labour
few
of
them
indeed
could
now
boast
of
a
pig
in
the
sty
a
treasure
which
they
had
till
very
lately
always
possessed
yet
they
could
occasionally
purchase
a
pound
of
bacon
or
other
meat
although
at
a
very
considerable
increase
in
the
price
they
soon
however
felt
and
keenly
felt
that
their
condition
was
altered
and
was
still
rapidly
altering
for
the
worse
they
consequently
grew
less
tractable
and
cheerful
in
their
dispositions
they
went
to
their
daily
labour
with
more
reluctance
and
became
more
sullen
and
discontented
as
their
privations
increased
but
still
they
were
not
emaciated
and
become
languid
and
weak
as
most
of
them
now
are
for
the
want
of
a
sufficiency
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
as
a
proof
of
this
i
will
mention
a
day
work
done
by
myself
and
three
others
all
of
whom
are
now
alive
and
living
in
the
parish
of
euford
but
alas
how
altered
how
wretched
in
circumstances
compared
to
what
they
were
at
the
time
respecting
which
i
write
when
they
were
able
and
willing
to
do
and
did
accomplish
as
much
work
with
great
ease
in
one
day
as
would
now
occupy
them
i
am
sure
for
four
days
in
fact
such
is
the
alteration
in
their
state
from
having
lived
so
badly
and
worked
so
hard
for
the
last
twenty
years
that
they
are
become
so
reduced
in
bodily
strength
that
they
would
now
feel
more
fatigue
in
doing
one
quarter
of
the
work
in
a
day
than
they
did
in
performing
the
whole
at
that
time
the
names
of
the
men
are
barnaby
marshal
thomas
ayres
and
james
pinnels
these
three
men
and
myself
have
frequently
winnowed
large
heaps
of
corn
in
a
day
and
we
once
accomplished
the
winnowing
sixty
sacks
of
wheat
in
one
day
thirty
sacks
being
considered
a
good
day
work
for
four
men
in
one
instance
two
men
in
each
of
two
adjoining
barns
had
thrashed
a
very
large
heap
of
wheat
which
had
yielded
so
well
that
we
estimated
each
heap
to
contain
of
the
best
wheat
and
every
one
calculated
upon
its
being
two
smart
day
work
to
winnow
it
however
on
the
day
appointed
to
winnow
one
of
these
heaps
some
time
in
the
beginning
of
may
myself
and
some
young
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
had
agreed
to
meet
in
the
evening
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
rooks
i
therefore
requested
the
three
persons
above
named
to
be
in
readiness
to
begin
winnowing
at
or
soon
after
five
instead
of
six
in
the
morning
the
winnowing
tackle
was
prepared
over
night
i
had
got
the
doors
of
the
barn
open
before
hand
and
not
one
of
them
was
behind
the
time
appointed
they
well
knowing
that
the
exhilarating
jug
of
nut
brown
ale
would
not
be
wanting
upon
such
an
occasion
as
the
church
clock
struck
five
every
man
was
at
his
post
and
the
merry
van
went
briskly
round
as
each
well
knew
his
duty
so
that
no
labour
should
be
lost
we
had
made
such
rapid
progress
by
six
that
is
to
say
in
one
hour
that
ayres
in
a
joke
said
if
we
continue
at
this
rate
master
we
shall
be
able
to
finish
both
heaps
instead
of
one
a
joke
of
that
sort
was
never
thrown
away
upon
me
and
accordingly
i
immediately
adopted
the
idea
for
having
once
conceived
a
project
i
never
hesitated
but
instantly
began
to
put
it
in
execution
i
said
that
it
was
certainly
two
good
day
work
for
four
but
if
they
would
back
me
we
would
see
if
could
not
do
two
good
days
work
in
day
my
fellow
workmen
who
were
become
almost
as
great
enthusiasts
as
myself
spontaneously
replied
with
all
our
hearts
master
if
you
say
the
word
we
will
try
we
are
not
afraid
to
attempt
any
thing
you
will
undertake
two
more
men
were
employed
to
bring
the
heap
from
the
other
barn
and
add
it
to
that
which
we
had
begun
and
the
result
was
that
when
the
clock
struck
six
in
the
evening
we
four
of
us
had
completely
winnowed
and
finished
sacks
of
best
wheat
besides
tailing
and
had
loaded
the
waggon
with
thirty
of
them
for
market
the
next
day
i
having
carried
the
thirty
sacks
into
the
waggon
myself
now
washed
cleaned
and
dressed
myself
and
had
joined
my
friends
in
the
field
partaking
of
the
sport
of
rook
shooting
before
six
in
the
evening
and
i
took
care
that
my
three
should
be
rewarded
with
the
first
three
dozen
of
young
rooks
that
were
killed
as
a
proof
that
the
corn
was
well
winnowed
my
father
sold
it
at
the
next
at
devizes
for
three
shillings
per
sack
higher
than
any
other
sample
in
the
market
i
now
met
with
a
very
great
loss
as
my
worthy
friend
and
preceptor
carrington
the
curate
with
whom
i
had
passed
so
many
pleasant
hours
and
from
whom
i
had
received
so
much
valuable
information
and
such
good
and
useful
advice
was
about
to
leave
the
vicarage
of
enford
he
having
been
offered
and
accepted
the
situation
of
tutor
to
the
sons
of
the
earl
of
berkley
and
as
this
was
the
likely
road
to
preferment
i
rejoiced
in
his
success
although
i
very
much
lamented
his
absence
he
was
to
say
the
least
of
him
an
excellent
neighbour
and
a
very
worthy
man
he
was
cheerful
amiable
and
conciliating
in
his
manners
he
possessed
a
very
superior
understanding
which
he
had
much
improved
and
embellished
by
his
application
to
the
study
of
the
most
useful
and
refined
literature
he
having
received
a
very
liberal
education
and
though
he
was
an
excellent
classical
scholar
he
was
neither
a
pedant
nor
a
bigot
he
lived
a
moral
sober
and
rational
life
worthy
the
example
of
his
parishioners
and
although
he
was
not
enabled
to
be
very
bountiful
having
only
sixty
pounds
a
year
as
his
salary
and
his
house
to
live
in
he
nevertheless
honestly
paid
every
one
as
he
went
and
saved
some
small
trifle
for
a
wet
day
by
all
his
neighbours
he
was
much
beloved
and
his
society
much
courted
by
those
who
knew
how
to
estimate
the
value
of
a
superior
mind
and
an
enlightened
and
comprehensive
understanding
he
took
great
delight
in
imparting
to
me
the
knowledge
which
he
had
acquired
and
when
he
left
the
parish
of
enford
no
one
felt
his
loss
more
acutely
or
lamented
it
more
sincerely
than
i
did
because
he
had
the
sense
and
the
penetration
to
discover
and
the
honesty
to
reprobate
the
fatal
measures
of
pitt
he
was
denounced
by
the
vulgar
the
ignorant
and
the
bigotted
by
the
venal
and
by
the
corrupt
as
a
jacobin
but
he
was
admired
by
all
good
and
liberal
men
of
all
parties
and
his
society
was
courted
by
every
rational
thinking
and
intelligent
man
in
the
country
round
where
he
lived
the
society
that
i
met
at
his
house
was
my
greatest
solace
and
comfort
after
the
fatigues
and
the
labours
of
the
day
i
was
always
welcome
and
i
never
passed
an
hour
in
his
society
without
having
gained
some
useful
information
or
some
substantial
accomplishment
many
of
the
young
people
of
the
village
who
did
not
associate
much
with
carrington
and
who
were
neither
capable
of
appreciating
his
merits
nor
of
deriving
pleasure
from
his
refined
society
were
delighted
to
find
that
there
was
a
gay
young
buck
of
a
clergyman
just
returned
from
oxford
who
was
to
occupy
the
situation
of
my
worthy
friend
but
alas
what
a
contrast
i
did
not
expect
to
find
such
another
kind
and
amiable
companion
and
friend
as
him
that
i
had
lost
but
i
anticipated
that
he
would
be
a
scholar
and
a
man
of
the
world
and
at
all
events
a
suitable
associate
for
myself
but
as
he
is
no
more
i
shall
be
very
brief
he
was
in
a
word
in
every
thing
the
reverse
the
very
opposite
of
carrington
the
sunday
arrived
and
my
father
as
the
principal
person
in
the
village
always
anxious
to
be
the
first
to
shew
his
attention
to
a
stranger
and
particularly
when
that
stranger
was
clothed
in
the
dress
of
of
the
parish
waited
upon
him
at
the
inn
or
where
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
and
not
only
invited
him
to
dine
but
also
offered
him
a
bed
and
a
stall
for
his
horse
till
he
was
better
provided
at
the
vicarage
i
of
course
accompanied
my
father
and
we
had
little
difficulty
in
getting
over
the
first
introduction
he
was
a
young
man
of
easy
manners
and
address
and
without
the
least
ceremony
accepted
the
invitation
to
dine
c
but
he
informed
us
that
he
had
made
a
bargain
and
had
taken
lodgings
and
intended
to
board
with
the
landlady
at
the
swan
as
he
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
living
in
a
dull
country
vicarage
house
by
himself
we
went
to
church
where
he
the
service
in
quick
and
tipped
us
as
he
had
previously
informed
me
he
would
a
as
a
specimen
of
his
style
of
oratory
he
appeared
a
clever
thoughtless
youth
of
but
the
rake
as
my
father
said
stood
confessed
in
his
eye
and
its
effects
sat
visible
upon
his
brow
after
dinner
he
took
his
wine
like
a
and
before
he
had
finished
a
bottle
he
was
as
drunk
as
a
so
much
so
that
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
performing
the
afternoon
duty
without
exposing
his
situation
to
the
whole
congregation
my
father
was
shocked
at
his
indiscretion
and
sent
a
hasty
excuse
to
put
off
the
afternoon
service
as
drunkenness
was
not
encouraged
nor
even
tolerated
in
my
father
house
he
was
very
anxious
to
conceal
the
circumstance
of
the
young
parson
having
become
so
much
intoxicated
at
his
table
as
to
be
incapable
of
performing
his
duty
and
he
felt
it
the
greater
disgrace
as
he
was
the
principal
as
well
as
the
principal
parishioner
i
took
the
hopeful
and
reverend
young
gentleman
who
had
been
so
recently
inspired
by
the
to
take
priest
orders
a
walk
into
the
fields
to
recover
him
a
little
as
my
father
thought
him
a
very
improper
guest
to
introduce
into
the
to
his
daughters
in
the
course
of
our
walk
he
professed
a
very
sincere
and
warm
friendship
for
me
and
promised
himself
a
world
of
pleasure
in
my
society
and
he
frankly
and
unblushingly
informed
me
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
oxford
a
bad
venereal
complaint
which
he
added
was
most
unfortunate
as
he
was
fearful
that
he
should
inoculate
all
the
pretty
damsels
belonging
to
his
new
flock
which
would
be
a
i
premised
by
saying
that
i
should
be
very
brief
but
i
fear
that
some
of
my
moral
male
as
well
as
all
my
female
readers
will
think
that
as
to
this
young
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
i
have
already
said
too
much
but
sorry
am
i
to
declare
that
in
the
little
which
i
have
said
i
have
drawn
his
character
too
faithfully
he
lived
but
a
short
time
having
soon
fallen
a
victim
to
his
profligate
course
of
life
he
was
little
more
than
a
year
i
think
the
pastor
of
the
parish
and
he
administered
the
sacrament
and
performed
all
the
other
offices
of
the
curate
when
the
effects
of
his
drinking
did
not
interfere
with
it
and
during
this
time
he
always
lodged
at
the
public
house
this
was
a
sad
example
for
the
people
of
the
parish
the
young
farmers
were
already
too
much
addicted
to
drinking
but
they
had
been
heretofore
kept
in
check
and
under
some
sort
of
controul
by
the
admonition
and
by
the
example
of
their
late
clergyman
who
during
all
the
years
that
he
had
resided
there
was
never
known
to
be
intoxicated
or
in
any
way
disguised
in
liquor
to
be
sure
he
was
a
but
he
was
nevertheless
a
moral
amiable
and
although
he
was
no
bigot
he
most
strictly
regularly
and
rigidly
performed
the
sacred
duty
he
had
undertaken
with
great
satisfaction
to
his
parishioners
and
with
great
credit
to
himself
as
a
man
a
clergyman
and
a
christian
but
during
the
life
of
his
successor
they
had
no
jacobin
he
was
a
furious
church
and
kingman
although
a
complete
free
thinker
over
his
cups
and
would
get
drunk
and
roar
god
save
the
king
with
any
drunken
loyalist
in
the
district
and
to
shew
his
zeal
in
this
way
he
entered
and
served
as
a
private
and
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
the
everly
troop
of
yeomanry
cavalry
just
raised
he
was
however
too
enervated
and
too
emaciated
to
acquire
any
knowledge
of
the
military
exercise
and
what
was
rather
remarkable
there
was
another
young
sprig
of
the
church
to
keep
him
in
countenance
who
was
also
a
private
in
the
same
troop
of
yeomanry
although
i
sometimes
made
one
of
the
bacchanalian
party
of
our
curate
yet
i
felt
most
severely
the
difference
between
this
society
and
that
of
carrington
upon
the
death
of
this
infatuated
young
man
another
curate
was
sent
down
by
the
vicar
who
was
the
rev
john
prince
the
chaplain
to
the
magdalen
and
who
it
was
thought
would
be
more
particular
in
the
choice
of
those
with
whom
he
trusted
the
care
of
the
souls
of
his
parishioners
our
new
curate
arrived
fresh
from
oxford
and
as
he
brought
letters
of
recommendation
to
my
father
from
the
vicar
who
was
a
very
worthy
and
a
most
circumspect
man
he
invited
him
to
his
house
and
he
proved
to
be
a
much
more
rational
young
man
than
his
predecessor
though
he
did
not
evince
any
great
knowledge
of
the
world
yet
he
had
mixed
in
good
society
and
i
promised
myself
a
great
acquisition
in
his
acquaintance
we
soon
however
found
that
he
had
not
been
educated
at
oxford
for
nothing
he
had
acquired
a
habit
of
taking
his
bottle
freely
and
as
he
had
not
a
very
hard
head
he
was
frequently
very
much
intoxicated
before
his
more
robust
neighbours
were
scarcely
yet
warmed
with
their
glasses
this
was
a
dreadful
misfortune
for
my
young
friend
as
well
as
for
myself
for
he
was
an
intelligent
young
man
when
he
was
sober
but
the
moment
the
wine
began
to
operate
he
was
one
of
the
completest
fools
in
christendom
he
was
then
as
great
as
a
king
and
always
when
he
was
the
most
contemptible
he
fancied
himself
a
very
great
man
and
never
failed
to
boast
of
his
superiority
of
education
and
his
having
taken
his
degree
at
christ
church
this
he
was
always
sure
to
do
when
he
had
lost
the
little
talent
and
intellect
that
he
possessed
when
he
was
sober
at
the
very
moment
that
he
was
looked
upon
with
a
degree
of
mingled
and
by
those
around
him
he
was
sure
to
assume
a
ridiculous
superiority
over
his
more
rational
companions
merely
as
he
professed
because
he
was
brought
up
at
college
there
was
about
this
time
great
talk
of
an
invasion
by
the
french
the
ministers
having
granted
large
subsidies
and
having
imposed
new
taxes
found
it
necessary
to
frighten
john
bull
with
the
idea
of
being
invaded
great
alarm
was
therefore
excited
throughout
the
country
volunteer
corps
and
troops
of
yeomanry
were
raising
all
over
the
island
provisions
had
by
this
time
increased
in
price
every
article
of
common
consumption
was
nearly
doubled
and
great
dissatisfaction
was
evinced
amongst
the
labouring
poor
there
were
riots
in
many
parts
of
the
country
and
much
mischief
was
done
by
burning
and
pulling
down
mills
in
consequence
of
the
high
price
of
bread
but
the
dread
of
invasion
was
in
every
one
mouth
and
nothing
else
was
talked
of
i
therefore
was
one
who
anticipated
nothing
less
than
an
immediate
attempt
and
i
applied
to
my
father
and
requested
that
he
would
purchase
me
a
proper
charger
and
let
me
enter
into
a
troop
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
he
expostulated
and
strongly
urged
me
to
desist
and
he
repeated
his
former
arguments
but
i
replied
that
i
was
ashamed
to
stand
by
and
to
look
on
with
my
arms
folded
while
all
the
youth
and
vigour
of
the
country
were
flying
to
arms
in
order
to
repel
the
expected
attempts
of
a
desperate
and
powerful
invading
foe
he
endeavoured
to
convince
me
of
the
folly
of
my
enthusiasm
urging
that
most
of
those
who
had
enrolled
themselves
in
the
yeomanry
were
solely
actuated
by
a
desire
to
take
care
of
their
own
property
that
they
were
impelled
to
take
up
arms
merely
by
selfish
motives
and
without
possessing
a
spark
of
the
he
recalled
to
my
recollection
the
immense
sacrifices
made
by
our
forefather
colonel
thomas
hunt
in
the
reign
of
the
charles
he
pointed
out
the
noble
domains
and
productive
estates
that
were
confiscated
by
cromwell
in
consequence
of
my
zeal
in
the
cause
of
his
prince
and
he
begged
me
to
remember
how
he
was
rewarded
for
his
services
asking
me
what
reason
i
had
to
expect
a
better
fate
or
a
higher
reward
than
my
forefather
had
obtained
for
all
his
exertions
dangers
and
sacrifices
which
were
the
loss
of
his
estates
and
the
ingratitude
of
the
prince
that
he
so
faithfully
served
all
this
might
be
and
was
very
true
but
i
reasoned
with
myself
thus
my
forefather
took
up
arms
in
favour
of
a
tyrant
to
support
him
in
most
arbitrary
measures
against
his
own
countrymen
but
my
only
wish
is
to
arm
myself
against
a
foreign
invader
whose
great
object
i
am
told
is
to
enslave
after
having
conquered
the
people
of
my
native
land
all
reasoning
with
me
was
consequently
in
vain
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
stand
idle
and
be
a
in
such
times
the
fervour
of
my
youth
had
been
worked
upon
by
the
delusion
of
the
day
and
it
would
not
admit
of
this
restraint
therefore
without
farther
ceremony
in
spite
of
my
expostulations
i
enrolled
my
name
as
a
member
of
the
everly
troop
of
yeomanry
under
the
command
of
the
captain
astley
i
knew
the
captain
to
be
a
poor
creature
and
as
little
cut
out
for
a
warrior
as
any
man
i
had
ever
met
with
he
was
built
like
ajax
but
as
for
skill
or
valour
i
believed
him
to
possess
neither
i
had
however
no
fears
of
being
left
to
be
led
into
the
field
of
battle
by
the
worthy
justice
in
case
it
should
ever
come
to
that
issue
i
had
no
doubt
that
proper
and
experienced
officers
would
be
appointed
to
lead
us
on
i
bought
an
excellent
thoroughbred
charger
near
sixteen
hands
high
for
although
my
own
horse
was
a
very
good
one
and
better
than
eight
out
of
ten
in
the
troop
yet
as
he
was
rather
under
the
regulation
size
i
was
determined
to
be
as
well
mounted
as
any
man
in
the
regiment
and
as
i
was
well
known
to
be
a
good
rider
and
a
bold
and
determined
the
captain
was
very
much
delighted
with
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
a
wonderful
acquisition
to
his
corps
my
father
also
now
i
was
entered
was
as
anxious
as
myself
that
i
should
not
be
outdone
by
any
one
i
therefore
immediately
employed
a
drill
serjeant
who
was
engaged
to
instruct
the
troop
in
their
exercise
and
who
had
been
drilling
them
for
some
time
past
and
before
the
first
arrived
for
me
to
attend
my
instructor
pronounced
me
fit
for
service
and
as
well
disciplined
as
any
man
in
the
troop
perhaps
i
had
bestowed
as
much
pains
and
had
spent
as
much
time
as
any
of
them
though
i
had
been
drilled
only
for
about
a
fortnight
for
i
was
at
it
every
day
two
or
three
hours
in
truth
i
was
an
apt
scholar
and
being
already
an
excellent
horseman
and
extremely
active
i
could
before
i
had
ever
joined
perform
most
of
the
evolutions
and
as
the
serjeant
said
do
any
thing
as
well
as
himself
he
told
me
that
in
many
of
my
brother
soldiers
i
should
meet
with
some
stupid
heavy
fellows
and
that
he
could
teach
me
more
in
a
day
than
many
of
them
would
learn
in
a
year
the
following
monday
was
appointed
for
us
to
assemble
and
have
a
field
day
when
captain
astley
and
lieutenant
sir
john
methuen
poore
who
had
gone
to
london
for
the
purpose
were
expected
to
attend
armed
and
dressed
complete
in
their
new
uniform
as
a
specimen
of
what
we
were
in
future
to
wear
the
reader
will
recollect
that
i
am
now
about
to
give
a
faithful
history
of
my
military
services
and
i
must
therefore
entreat
his
indulgence
while
i
put
upon
record
some
such
circumstances
and
occurrences
as
he
will
be
little
prepared
to
hear
unless
it
have
been
his
fate
to
be
a
member
of
some
volunteer
corps
under
the
command
of
such
officers
as
captain
astley
lieutenant
sir
john
poore
and
cornet
dyke
without
farther
comment
then
the
two
gallant
officers
astley
and
poore
started
the
week
before
to
london
to
superintend
the
making
and
to
arrange
with
the
army
taylor
the
particulars
of
the
having
been
very
particular
in
getting
the
taylor
boot
and
even
to
fit
them
to
a
t
on
the
friday
they
both
appeared
accoutred
from
head
to
toe
at
edmonds
somerset
coffee
house
in
the
strand
and
really
cut
no
small
swell
as
they
marched
up
and
down
the
coffee
room
they
would
then
take
a
turn
down
the
strand
as
far
as
exeter
exchange
and
if
luckily
for
him
polito
had
seen
them
he
might
possibly
have
made
a
good
bargain
by
chewing
them
amongst
the
other
wild
beasts
which
he
exhibited
to
the
wondering
multitude
they
next
showed
off
in
full
uniform
with
their
broad
swords
by
their
sides
in
the
front
boxes
of
drury
lane
theatre
and
as
the
wiltshire
was
one
of
the
first
regiments
of
yeomanry
that
was
raised
and
clothed
they
excited
no
small
curiosity
amongst
the
londoners
on
saturday
morning
they
again
entered
the
coffee
room
in
all
their
trappings
and
having
each
purchased
a
brace
of
excellent
pistols
they
appeared
eager
to
begin
the
campaign
without
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
french
troops
and
as
clark
and
haines
two
notorious
highwaymen
were
at
this
time
levying
their
nightly
contributions
upon
hounslow
heath
they
more
than
hinted
their
intention
of
capturing
or
killing
these
desperadoes
in
case
they
should
fall
in
with
them
during
their
march
down
into
the
country
which
they
had
given
due
notice
they
intended
to
commence
on
that
afternoon
about
two
the
captain
travelling
carriage
and
four
was
brought
to
the
door
of
the
coffee
house
these
circumstances
were
detailed
to
me
by
a
gentleman
present
and
who
really
was
rather
alarmed
at
their
warlike
appearance
and
manner
and
language
having
seated
themselves
with
all
their
military
finery
in
the
carriage
they
carefully
placed
their
brace
of
horse
in
the
front
pocket
taking
care
to
leave
the
sticking
out
threateningly
visible
to
every
eye
that
surveyed
them
a
crowd
was
collected
round
the
carriage
to
witness
the
departure
of
these
mighty
warriors
whose
appearance
denoted
a
most
determined
conflict
in
case
any
thing
should
occur
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
showing
how
worthy
they
were
to
command
and
to
lead
into
the
heat
of
battle
a
body
of
their
countrymen
who
were
seeking
the
bubble
reputation
even
in
the
cannon
mouth
about
four
they
arrived
at
the
bush
at
staines
having
taken
care
to
pass
hounslow
heath
the
scene
of
action
by
day
light
having
by
this
piece
of
generalship
escaped
the
danger
so
far
they
slept
that
night
at
white
excellent
inn
at
staines
bridge
the
next
morning
sunday
after
taking
a
good
breakfast
dressed
and
armed
as
before
in
all
their
military
array
they
took
up
their
pistols
which
had
been
placed
by
them
on
the
table
and
then
adjourned
into
the
garden
whence
they
fired
them
into
the
thames
at
once
to
try
how
true
they
would
carry
the
balls
and
to
give
notice
to
the
surrounding
and
astonished
passengers
upon
the
bridge
that
they
travelled
like
warriors
prepared
for
any
emergency
that
might
arise
having
their
pistols
in
the
presence
of
joseph
white
and
each
of
them
taken
a
glass
of
noyeau
to
exhilarate
their
spirits
the
horses
were
ordered
too
and
the
carriage
was
now
brought
to
the
front
door
having
taken
another
turn
round
the
bowling
green
in
the
garden
to
exhibit
themselves
to
the
gaping
multitude
who
were
now
collected
in
considerable
numbers
upon
the
bridge
brought
thither
in
consequence
of
the
discharging
of
pistols
on
a
sunday
morning
and
who
were
waiting
to
see
their
departure
they
entered
the
carriage
in
the
same
formal
manner
as
they
had
done
at
the
door
of
the
somerset
coffee
house
and
having
carefully
and
deliberately
placed
their
pistols
again
in
the
front
pocket
with
their
as
before
appearing
very
prominent
out
of
the
chaise
window
they
proceeded
on
their
march
with
a
sort
of
solemn
gravity
which
excited
the
surprise
of
some
few
but
the
laughter
of
the
greater
portion
of
their
beholders
it
was
on
a
sunday
morning
about
eight
when
they
started
from
staines
in
this
warlike
attitude
their
helmets
glittering
in
the
sun
like
the
peacock
vain
of
his
plumes
they
however
little
dreamt
of
the
disaster
that
was
in
store
for
them
having
passed
virginia
water
and
as
the
postboy
was
taking
them
leisurely
along
up
the
steep
hill
leading
to
bagshot
who
should
ride
up
to
the
side
of
the
chaise
but
a
single
highwayman
who
having
ordered
the
boy
to
halt
deliberately
demanded
their
money
and
watches
the
yeomanry
heroes
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
their
pistols
but
neither
of
them
had
the
power
of
putting
forth
a
hand
to
grasp
either
of
them
the
highwayman
again
hastily
demanded
his
prize
which
was
immediately
granted
our
heroes
handing
over
to
him
their
purses
containing
about
sixty
guineas
and
two
valuable
family
gold
watches
it
is
said
that
sir
john
poore
after
having
recovered
a
little
from
the
fright
endeavoured
to
raise
his
inconsolable
companion
from
the
stupor
in
which
this
sad
misfortune
had
left
him
by
repeating
the
following
lines
of
hudibras
he
that
fights
and
runs
away
may
live
to
fight
another
day
but
he
that
is
in
battle
slain
can
never
live
to
fight
again
who
was
too
much
absorbed
in
ruminating
upon
his
melancholy
situation
to
give
his
friend
any
other
answer
than
a
long
and
deep
sigh
could
not
but
most
sensibly
feel
that
they
were
in
a
still
worse
plight
than
the
knight
of
the
rueful
countenance
ever
was
for
they
had
run
away
without
having
made
any
fight
at
all
so
ashamed
were
they
of
their
misadventure
that
they
would
not
have
mentioned
it
to
any
one
had
they
not
been
compelled
to
disclose
it
to
the
landlords
of
the
various
inns
they
had
to
pass
for
the
unmannerly
fellow
had
not
even
left
them
a
tester
to
pay
the
turnpikes
when
they
arrived
at
everley
sir
john
was
ashamed
to
face
the
troop
to
tell
them
the
story
although
we
were
already
in
the
field
anxious
to
see
our
commanders
dressed
up
in
their
new
uniform
all
the
golden
dreams
of
glory
seemed
to
sir
john
to
have
vanished
by
this
unlucky
affair
and
nothing
could
induce
him
to
shew
himself
off
to
his
troop
though
his
charger
was
ready
to
convey
him
to
the
field
and
he
was
urged
by
all
the
expostulations
and
intreaties
of
the
captain
he
therefore
sneaked
off
home
to
rushall
and
left
the
gallant
captain
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
by
himself
in
the
mean
time
we
had
been
manoeuvring
charging
and
wheeling
till
we
were
almost
all
tired
waiting
for
this
exhibition
at
length
we
were
informed
of
the
disaster
by
one
of
the
serjeants
william
butcher
of
shercot
who
had
called
at
the
captain
house
to
know
what
was
the
matter
the
mighty
hero
at
last
appeared
in
view
mounted
upon
his
charger
riding
solemnly
towards
the
troop
dressed
in
full
uniform
the
same
which
he
had
worn
down
from
town
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
trifling
which
might
have
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
disastrous
fright
he
had
received
upon
the
road
some
admired
the
dress
some
pitied
the
loss
sustained
by
the
poor
captain
but
myself
and
many
of
those
who
surrounded
me
though
we
felt
the
deep
disgrace
which
had
befallen
our
commander
could
scarcely
contain
ourselves
with
laughter
at
the
ridiculous
figure
he
cut
particularly
when
the
event
of
the
robbery
came
across
our
thoughts
i
had
often
heard
of
a
hog
in
armour
but
i
had
never
before
seen
any
thing
that
appeared
to
convey
the
representation
so
much
to
my
mind
as
the
ridiculous
figure
of
our
captain
the
very
first
called
to
my
recollection
the
sentiments
of
my
father
and
the
worthy
clergyman
carrington
as
to
the
patriotism
of
these
yeomanry
corps
their
conversation
was
entirely
about
keeping
up
the
price
of
corn
keeping
down
the
price
of
wages
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
in
subjugation
the
labourers
and
silencing
their
dissatisfaction
as
i
rode
home
from
the
field
the
first
day
i
felt
that
there
was
too
much
truth
in
the
assertions
of
carrington
and
my
father
i
was
however
determined
to
do
my
duty
to
the
best
of
my
power
without
troubling
myself
about
the
views
and
motives
of
my
comrades
and
likewise
at
all
times
to
resist
with
all
my
influence
any
act
of
aggression
or
oppression
that
might
be
attempted
come
from
whatever
quarter
it
might
nor
was
i
less
resolved
to
be
always
ready
at
a
short
notice
to
meet
the
enemy
whenever
i
should
be
called
upon
within
one
month
after
i
had
been
in
this
troop
the
labourers
of
enford
and
the
adjoining
parishes
smarting
under
the
privations
and
sufferings
they
had
to
endure
in
consequence
of
the
rise
in
the
price
of
provisions
and
the
low
rate
of
wages
which
latter
many
of
the
farmers
had
decided
to
keep
down
to
the
old
standard
and
urged
on
also
by
those
who
ought
to
have
known
better
and
who
instead
of
secretly
exciting
their
poorer
neighbours
to
acts
of
desperation
ought
to
have
come
forward
manfully
to
advocate
their
rights
the
labourers
under
the
secret
influence
of
a
designing
man
or
two
all
struck
their
work
and
having
assembled
in
a
large
body
they
openly
avowed
their
intention
to
pull
down
several
mills
which
were
pointed
out
as
well
as
to
burn
the
corn
ricks
of
several
obnoxious
individuals
i
had
been
from
home
and
when
i
returned
i
found
several
of
the
neighbouring
farmers
assembled
at
my
father
in
the
greatest
consternation
some
of
those
whose
premises
had
been
pointed
out
for
destruction
were
present
and
although
none
of
my
father
property
was
threatened
yet
several
of
our
servants
had
joined
the
rioters
who
we
were
informed
were
assembled
to
the
number
of
two
or
three
hundred
and
that
they
were
proceeding
towards
netheravon
where
they
meant
to
regale
themselves
at
the
public
house
till
the
evening
when
the
work
of
destruction
was
to
begin
each
farmer
fled
to
his
home
in
order
to
save
what
he
could
but
all
were
in
the
greatest
dismay
a
servant
now
came
to
inform
us
that
our
carter
jerry
truman
who
looked
after
the
team
at
weddington
farm
had
left
his
horses
and
joined
the
rioters
and
that
two
men
had
been
dispatched
up
to
one
of
our
shepherds
upon
the
down
who
had
refused
to
join
them
in
the
morning
to
compel
him
to
leave
his
sheep
and
to
join
them
immediately
my
father
who
as
well
as
myself
had
been
devising
means
to
prevent
if
possible
the
threatened
mischief
now
said
though
none
of
our
property
is
threatened
though
we
have
had
no
share
in
oppressing
the
men
and
though
those
who
by
their
arbitrary
and
overbearing
conduct
to
their
servants
have
greatly
contributed
to
produce
this
state
of
things
are
now
the
danger
approaches
the
first
to
fly
from
it
and
consequently
for
their
past
infamously
bad
treatment
of
their
labourers
and
their
recent
cowardice
almost
deserve
what
they
have
brought
upon
themselves
and
that
they
should
be
left
to
their
fate
yet
my
son
it
is
our
duty
even
if
it
were
only
in
pity
to
the
poor
misguided
men
themselves
to
endeavour
to
avert
by
some
prompt
measure
if
possible
the
threatened
calamity
he
added
but
we
must
be
or
our
efforts
will
be
in
vain
i
said
in
answer
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
proceed
instantly
to
rescue
the
shepherd
who
was
unwilling
either
to
leave
his
flock
or
to
join
the
rioters
but
my
father
advised
me
not
to
waste
my
time
by
encountering
two
such
ruffians
as
we
knew
were
gone
for
him
he
would
he
said
take
his
horse
and
proceed
to
put
the
sheep
in
the
fold
to
prevent
their
getting
into
and
destroying
the
corn
and
he
would
have
me
ride
with
all
speed
to
the
only
efficient
magistrate
in
the
neighbourhood
webb
of
milton
to
procure
a
warrant
for
the
apprehension
of
truman
there
being
no
pretence
for
his
rioting
on
account
of
the
high
price
of
provisions
because
he
was
a
young
unmarried
man
and
had
for
wages
ten
guineas
a
year
and
all
his
eatables
and
drink
found
for
him
in
the
house
for
said
he
if
we
are
armed
with
a
warrant
from
the
civil
power
i
think
we
shall
stand
a
much
better
chance
of
preventing
mischief
and
perhaps
bloodshed
than
by
any
thing
that
will
be
done
by
the
yeomanry
but
i
very
much
doubt
whether
the
latter
will
muster
at
all
although
the
alarmed
parties
are
flying
in
all
directions
to
the
officers
of
of
and
of
for
that
purpose
all
of
whom
were
also
magistrates
i
merely
asked
my
father
whether
i
had
better
not
apply
to
astley
first
for
a
warrant
as
he
only
lived
four
miles
off
and
in
the
road
to
webb
who
lived
eight
miles
distant
his
answer
was
certainly
not
we
must
not
trust
to
chance
proceed
at
once
to
webb
for
while
you
are
humdrumming
with
astley
who
will
either
be
afraid
or
not
know
how
to
act
you
will
have
obtained
what
we
want
from
webb
in
half
the
time
i
then
sprung
on
my
horse
which
ready
saddled
had
stood
at
the
gate
during
this
conference
and
putting
him
to
full
speed
i
was
out
of
sight
in
a
twinkling
as
i
passed
up
the
field
i
saw
my
two
gentlemen
striding
over
the
fallows
towards
the
shepherd
whom
they
had
approached
within
about
two
hundred
yards
though
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
interfere
with
their
scheme
but
go
direct
to
the
magistrate
yet
as
they
were
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
out
of
my
road
i
could
not
resist
the
inclination
i
felt
to
check
their
progress
i
therefore
galloped
up
to
them
to
demand
where
they
were
going
over
our
private
property
they
at
once
boldly
avowed
their
object
to
be
to
make
our
shepherd
leave
his
flock
and
join
them
at
netheravon
i
briefly
expostulated
asking
if
they
meant
to
compel
the
man
to
go
against
his
will
they
replied
certainly
that
he
had
refused
to
accompany
them
in
the
morning
but
they
had
now
come
to
a
determination
that
he
should
go
as
i
found
them
determined
any
further
parley
was
in
vain
and
i
therefore
jumped
from
my
horse
which
was
in
the
habit
of
standing
without
being
held
and
placing
myself
before
them
i
demanded
that
they
should
instantly
desist
for
they
should
proceed
no
further
without
violence
they
nevertheless
advanced
boldly
and
were
instantly
knocked
down
with
two
blows
of
my
fist
one
of
them
remained
quietly
on
the
ground
the
other
rose
to
commence
a
conflict
but
he
was
instantly
levelled
to
the
earth
again
and
they
then
both
declared
they
would
return
with
all
speed
and
leave
the
shepherd
unmolested
if
i
would
spare
them
i
only
demanded
that
they
would
brush
off
in
double
quick
time
with
which
they
complied
never
staying
to
look
behind
them
this
certainly
was
a
very
hasty
although
a
very
successful
method
of
taking
the
law
into
my
own
hands
but
the
case
was
desperate
and
would
not
admit
of
any
common
remedy
my
horse
almost
fled
to
milton
where
luckily
i
found
the
worthy
and
truly
efficient
magistrate
at
home
the
oath
was
administered
and
the
warrant
made
out
in
a
few
minutes
while
his
servant
gave
my
panting
steed
a
little
hay
and
a
drop
of
water
which
enabled
him
to
carry
me
back
as
quickly
as
he
had
brought
me
as
i
returned
our
flock
of
sheep
were
grazing
and
the
shepherd
having
placed
himself
in
my
way
as
i
passed
him
he
gratefully
thanked
me
for
rescuing
him
from
the
danger
with
which
he
had
been
threatened
i
reached
home
within
one
hour
and
a
quarter
having
ridden
a
distance
of
sixteen
miles
and
procured
a
warrant
besides
rescuing
the
shepherd
in
that
short
space
of
time
i
found
my
father
waiting
for
me
with
the
of
littlecot
davis
who
kept
the
swan
an
old
gentleman
upwards
of
years
of
age
and
as
i
was
made
a
special
constable
to
execute
the
warrant
we
lost
not
a
moment
in
proceeding
to
the
scene
of
action
my
father
having
got
a
poney
ready
for
the
old
gentleman
to
ride
with
us
and
a
fresh
horse
saddled
for
me
we
soon
reached
netheravon
where
we
learned
of
the
rev
williams
that
the
men
to
the
amount
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
number
had
taken
possession
of
a
large
skittle
ground
at
the
back
of
the
red
lion
that
they
had
been
drinking
for
an
hour
having
already
taken
two
quarts
of
strong
beer
each
and
were
preparing
to
take
another
quart
each
before
they
sallied
forth
to
put
in
execution
the
devastating
scenes
that
they
had
contemplated
i
contrived
to
communicate
with
the
landlord
who
said
that
they
were
so
far
intoxicated
that
he
dared
not
refuse
them
beer
and
that
they
had
taken
forcible
possession
of
his
cellar
and
that
nothing
would
give
him
greater
relief
than
to
get
quit
of
such
troublesome
and
desperate
customers
i
immediately
formed
a
plan
to
get
them
out
of
the
skittle
ground
and
then
to
lock
the
doors
and
keep
them
out
of
the
public
house
away
from
intoxicating
liquors
of
which
they
had
already
taken
too
much
i
proposed
to
go
into
the
skittle
ground
with
davis
the
old
constable
and
seize
truman
for
whose
apprehension
the
warrant
was
granted
and
if
i
could
get
him
into
the
street
i
had
no
doubt
but
the
others
would
follow
in
order
to
rescue
him
as
soon
as
this
was
effected
the
people
in
the
red
lion
were
to
bolt
and
lock
all
their
doors
and
keep
them
out
of
the
house
this
was
thought
to
be
a
desperate
and
a
dangerous
plan
but
it
was
a
desperate
affair
things
were
drawing
fast
to
a
crisis
and
it
was
of
no
use
to
doubt
or
deliberate
having
formed
my
plan
i
insisted
upon
it
that
my
father
who
was
sixty
years
of
age
should
remain
without
with
the
horses
followed
by
the
old
constable
with
his
staff
of
office
in
his
hand
i
entered
and
we
had
got
up
to
truman
who
was
in
the
midst
of
them
before
we
were
as
yet
scarcely
perceived
by
many
of
the
groups
who
were
drinking
and
busily
arranging
their
plan
of
operations
i
shewed
the
warrant
and
having
seized
truman
by
the
collar
who
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
i
told
him
he
must
come
instantly
with
me
and
before
he
had
time
to
reply
or
even
say
a
word
i
hurried
him
through
his
companions
and
i
had
already
brought
him
to
the
door
of
the
yard
when
they
came
rushing
after
him
and
had
actually
got
hold
of
him
before
he
was
quite
out
of
the
door
with
one
determined
struggle
however
i
dragged
him
by
main
force
into
the
street
and
as
i
had
anticipated
the
whole
of
the
rioters
rushed
forward
into
the
street
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
rescue
him
i
knew
them
all
and
notwithstanding
they
began
to
use
violence
i
held
him
firm
till
i
saw
that
they
were
all
clear
of
the
yard
and
all
the
doors
of
the
public
house
were
closed
my
father
and
davis
were
unable
to
come
to
my
assistance
as
i
was
now
surrounded
by
the
whole
gang
though
i
never
felt
more
confident
or
more
cool
in
my
life
yet
the
situation
was
one
not
only
of
difficulty
but
of
danger
but
the
principal
object
being
attained
and
the
plan
having
succeeded
almost
to
a
miracle
i
had
only
to
identify
some
of
the
most
determined
and
violent
and
four
of
those
that
i
knew
perfectly
well
two
of
them
being
my
own
having
proceeded
to
collar
me
while
the
others
used
considerable
force
to
release
him
from
the
grasp
i
had
taken
of
his
collar
i
yielded
him
up
to
their
overpowering
numbers
at
the
same
time
earnestly
recommending
to
them
to
disperse
and
retire
to
their
homes
as
the
military
were
sent
for
and
expected
every
moment
truman
was
one
of
the
first
to
fly
and
he
returned
to
his
occupation
immediately
and
in
a
very
short
time
afterwards
the
whole
of
them
had
dispersed
in
different
directions
though
they
might
have
proceeded
with
impunity
for
aught
the
yeomanry
did
they
never
having
assembled
at
all
and
in
fact
although
i
was
in
the
troop
myself
i
never
thought
of
sending
for
them
my
father
and
the
old
constable
davis
and
myself
now
returned
home
not
a
little
elated
with
the
success
of
our
exertions
in
dispersing
these
deluded
and
desperate
men
but
my
father
observed
that
it
would
not
do
to
let
the
matter
rest
there
that
the
persons
whom
he
had
seen
use
great
personal
violence
to
me
who
was
acting
as
a
peace
officer
must
be
taught
that
they
were
not
to
violate
the
laws
in
such
a
daring
manner
with
impunity
and
he
urged
the
propriety
of
my
obtaining
a
warrant
to
take
them
before
a
magistrate
to
answer
for
the
breach
of
the
peace
which
they
had
committed
by
assaulting
me
in
the
execution
of
a
warrant
my
father
added
that
their
leaving
their
work
their
assembling
at
the
public
house
and
even
obtaining
beer
almost
by
force
might
have
been
overlooked
particularly
as
no
serious
mischief
had
followed
but
the
forcible
and
violent
rescue
and
resistance
to
the
execution
of
the
warrant
of
a
magistrate
could
not
be
overlooked
for
if
we
were
disposed
to
do
so
it
would
be
an
insult
to
webb
the
magistrate
who
had
granted
it
and
if
we
treated
him
who
was
the
only
real
efficient
magistrate
in
the
district
with
disrespect
we
could
not
expect
that
he
would
be
disposed
in
future
to
attend
so
promptly
to
our
representations
i
therefore
took
my
horse
the
next
morning
and
rode
to
milton
before
breakfast
and
having
made
the
necessary
depositions
he
granted
me
a
warrant
for
the
apprehension
of
and
four
others
who
had
been
particularly
prominent
in
the
rescue
namely
and
all
of
whom
had
either
struck
or
laid
violent
hands
upon
me
i
had
returned
and
taken
my
breakfast
by
ten
and
had
just
got
the
old
constable
davis
and
was
about
to
proceed
with
him
to
apprehend
the
said
persons
when
four
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
of
the
everly
troop
rode
boldly
into
the
yard
and
up
to
the
door
like
saying
that
they
had
heard
of
my
having
a
warrant
for
apprehending
some
of
the
rioters
and
that
they
were
sent
by
capt
astley
to
aid
and
assist
in
the
execution
of
the
warrant
adding
that
they
were
provided
with
ball
cartridges
and
some
to
spare
for
me
if
i
chose
to
saddle
my
charger
and
take
my
holsters
i
could
not
avoid
asking
the
heroes
with
rather
a
sarcastic
smile
where
they
had
kept
themselves
over
night
and
why
captain
astley
had
not
either
come
or
sent
some
of
the
troop
when
there
was
some
real
danger
and
not
waited
till
all
the
parties
were
separated
and
when
there
was
little
difficulty
in
securing
the
most
desperate
of
the
rioters
i
added
that
as
i
had
not
made
any
military
show
by
dressing
myself
up
in
my
regimentals
when
there
was
a
real
riot
i
should
at
all
events
trust
to
the
constable
staff
now
it
was
all
peaceable
and
i
begged
them
to
return
to
their
officers
with
that
message
i
however
requested
one
of
them
richard
pocock
of
enford
farm
who
now
lives
near
warminster
and
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
tything
man
to
doff
his
regimentals
and
then
i
would
admit
him
to
aid
and
assist
in
his
civil
but
i
would
not
accept
of
him
in
his
military
capacity
this
he
immediately
complied
with
and
we
took
the
five
persons
before
the
magistrate
webb
of
milton
who
insisted
upon
committing
them
all
to
prison
the
same
night
for
want
of
bail
though
they
begged
very
hard
for
mercy
in
which
petition
i
most
heartily
joined
but
the
worthy
magistrate
would
not
listen
to
any
such
thing
it
wanting
only
a
month
to
the
autumn
assizes
and
i
was
therefore
bound
over
to
prosecute
them
very
much
against
my
inclination
as
i
thereby
lost
at
least
three
valuable
servants
during
the
harvest
and
as
they
appeared
sensible
of
their
error
i
for
my
own
part
was
contented
to
let
them
depart
to
their
homes
but
the
magistrate
was
inexorable
declaring
it
to
be
too
serious
an
offence
to
be
pardoned
without
the
interposition
of
a
jury
a
true
bill
was
found
against
them
by
the
grand
jury
at
the
assizes
and
they
were
put
to
the
bar
i
appeared
against
them
but
employed
no
counsel
they
had
engaged
mr
jekyl
at
that
period
one
of
the
most
eminent
counsel
upon
the
western
circuit
after
the
court
had
heard
the
evidence
of
myself
and
davis
jekyl
made
a
most
eloquent
appeal
to
the
jury
a
a
special
jury
he
called
some
witnesses
to
their
character
but
no
one
appearing
offered
to
give
three
of
them
who
had
been
my
father
servants
a
character
for
sobriety
and
industry
with
which
the
court
and
counsel
appeared
much
pleased
their
case
went
to
the
jury
who
instantly
found
them
all
guilty
of
the
rescue
and
assault
upon
which
i
addressed
the
court
as
the
prosecutor
and
petitioned
that
they
might
be
restored
to
their
afflicted
families
and
i
promised
to
take
them
back
immediately
into
the
situations
which
they
had
before
occupied
in
my
father
service
the
humane
judge
who
participated
in
my
feelings
after
having
given
them
a
suitable
admonition
and
called
their
attention
to
my
disinterested
kindness
telling
them
they
were
entirely
indebted
to
my
humanity
for
the
lenity
he
should
shew
them
and
having
paid
me
a
most
gratifying
compliment
dismissed
them
with
the
punishment
of
a
fine
of
a
shilling
each
which
i
immediately
paid
for
them
the
whole
court
were
loud
in
their
praises
of
my
behaviour
upon
the
occasion
but
i
felt
ten
thousand
times
more
satisfaction
in
doing
a
generous
act
than
i
did
in
all
the
compliments
which
were
bestowed
upon
me
i
took
the
men
into
my
father
service
directly
and
i
can
safely
say
that
i
never
for
one
moment
since
had
any
reason
to
repent
the
exertion
i
made
to
save
them
from
punishment
some
of
them
lived
many
years
in
my
service
and
truman
remained
with
me
as
long
as
i
was
in
the
farming
business
and
actually
was
one
of
those
who
followed
me
out
of
wiltshire
into
sussex
when
i
went
to
reside
there
a
distance
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
four
out
of
the
five
men
are
still
alive
and
i
would
cheerfully
trust
my
life
in
either
of
their
hands
if
it
were
necessary
and
i
sincerely
believe
there
is
not
one
of
them
but
would
willingly
risk
his
life
to
serve
me
i
am
writing
this
account
in
my
dungeon
at
eleven
at
night
on
the
of
september
and
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
who
reads
it
not
to
draw
a
comparison
between
my
conduct
and
that
of
my
persecutors
i
would
not
part
with
the
sweet
delightful
reflection
which
the
remembrance
of
this
one
act
of
my
life
conveys
to
my
mind
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
possession
of
those
who
have
been
concerned
in
consigning
me
to
be
incarcerated
in
this
dungeon
for
two
years
and
six
months
according
to
common
calculation
one
quarter
of
the
remaining
part
of
my
natural
let
the
reader
only
consider
the
spirit
in
which
i
acted
towards
those
who
had
violated
the
laws
of
their
country
by
resisting
with
force
the
warrant
of
a
magistrate
and
who
had
violently
assaulted
the
peace
officer
in
his
duty
in
executing
that
warrant
and
then
contrast
it
with
the
vindictive
proceedings
against
me
for
having
attended
a
public
meeting
legally
and
constitutionally
assembled
to
remonstrate
with
the
throne
against
the
cruel
privations
and
sufferings
of
the
people
where
no
breach
of
the
peace
was
committed
where
not
even
the
slightest
resistance
was
made
or
even
premeditated
against
the
civil
power
look
at
this
picture
and
look
at
that
i
have
had
the
consolation
of
being
repeatedly
thanked
in
the
most
earnest
manner
by
these
poor
fellows
for
my
humanity
in
interposing
with
the
court
to
spare
them
from
punishment
but
i
have
felt
still
a
much
higher
pleasure
when
they
have
offered
up
their
thanks
to
me
for
having
ventured
my
life
to
snatch
them
from
the
jaws
of
the
gallows
when
they
were
incautiously
about
to
rush
into
them
by
pulling
down
mills
and
burning
wheat
ricks
these
might
well
have
been
called
poor
deluded
creatures
these
men
were
literally
deluded
and
those
who
urged
them
on
were
by
what
was
then
called
the
liberal
part
of
the
press
in
fact
almost
the
whole
daily
press
of
that
period
united
in
a
conspiracy
to
delude
the
people
by
railing
at
and
exciting
the
multitude
against
butchers
bakers
and
farmers
to
whom
not
only
the
fools
but
the
knaves
of
the
daily
press
attributed
the
high
price
of
provisions
the
liberal
part
of
the
press
was
so
ignorant
and
so
besotted
as
to
vomit
forth
its
daily
denunciations
against
the
avariciousness
of
millers
butchers
bakers
and
farmers
and
to
endeavour
to
inflame
the
suffering
people
by
teaching
them
that
these
persons
conspired
together
to
keep
up
the
price
of
provisions
to
an
unnatural
height
solely
to
put
money
in
their
own
pockets
the
ministerial
press
of
that
day
under
the
controul
of
pitt
and
he
was
cunning
enough
to
contrive
to
bribe
almost
all
the
talent
belonging
to
the
press
chimed
in
ding
dong
with
their
less
cunning
opponents
for
they
knew
that
it
was
pitt
policy
to
draw
the
public
attention
from
the
real
cause
of
the
distress
from
the
real
cause
of
the
high
price
of
provisions
which
they
were
well
aware
was
the
enormous
increase
of
the
taxes
and
by
the
joint
efforts
of
the
whig
and
tory
press
for
there
was
no
other
at
that
time
they
contrived
to
the
poor
people
the
to
such
a
degree
that
there
was
seldom
half
a
year
passed
away
without
a
considerable
number
of
persons
being
consigned
to
an
untimely
end
for
having
been
concerned
in
wreaking
their
vengeance
upon
some
miller
farmer
butcher
or
baker
or
other
dealer
in
human
food
these
poor
fellows
might
truly
be
stiled
the
and
the
the
conductors
of
the
public
press
were
but
too
successful
in
their
efforts
to
continue
them
in
ignorance
let
any
rational
sensible
man
only
look
back
to
the
columns
of
the
public
press
in
the
years
and
the
times
for
instance
let
him
take
a
file
of
the
times
of
that
day
and
for
many
many
years
after
that
even
up
to
and
and
compare
the
language
the
stile
and
the
tenor
of
their
articles
with
the
language
of
the
present
day
in
the
same
papers
how
many
riots
how
many
hangings
how
many
special
commissions
we
can
trace
back
all
proceeding
from
the
delusions
of
the
public
press
how
many
persons
have
lost
their
lives
for
plundering
pulling
down
and
burning
the
property
of
millers
butchers
and
bakers
how
much
blood
has
been
spilt
every
drop
of
which
blood
may
be
fairly
placed
at
the
door
of
those
who
urged
these
poor
fellows
on
and
instigated
them
to
acts
of
violence
against
those
classes
of
persons
by
falsely
accusing
them
of
being
the
cause
of
the
high
price
of
provisions
there
is
as
much
difference
between
the
times
of
and
the
times
of
as
there
is
between
a
riotous
of
to
pulling
down
and
burning
the
property
of
priestley
at
birmingham
poor
campbell
of
bath
burning
mills
wheat
ricks
destroying
machinery
and
the
sober
rational
assemblies
of
the
people
in
and
deliberately
petitioning
the
legislature
to
remove
the
burthens
of
the
people
by
abolishing
sinecure
places
and
unnecessary
pensions
and
praying
for
a
constitutional
reform
in
the
commons
house
of
parliament
my
readers
will
excuse
the
digression
i
have
made
this
subject
can
not
be
too
often
dwelt
upon
but
as
i
shall
have
repeated
opportunities
of
calling
the
attention
of
my
fellow
countrymen
to
this
particular
point
i
will
now
proceed
to
the
more
immediate
object
of
these
memoirs
i
was
now
incessant
in
my
application
to
every
branch
of
the
farming
business
and
as
i
have
before
intimated
i
performed
prodigies
of
labour
upon
various
occasions
my
father
had
now
taken
another
very
large
adjoining
farm
of
nearly
a
thousand
acres
chisenbury
farm
and
was
therefore
become
one
of
the
largest
farmers
in
england
yet
we
managed
this
business
with
the
greatest
ease
and
what
others
called
very
severe
labour
i
practised
as
a
relaxation
from
business
such
as
learning
the
cavalry
exercise
in
which
i
had
now
become
a
considerable
adept
in
fact
i
bore
the
character
of
being
one
of
the
most
active
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
powerful
young
men
in
the
county
and
my
feats
of
activity
and
strength
were
proverbial
i
would
mix
in
the
frolicks
of
a
country
wake
or
revel
as
they
were
called
in
wiltshire
and
contend
generally
successfully
with
the
first
proficients
of
the
day
in
wrestling
jumping
in
sacks
backsword
or
single
stick
playing
and
have
borne
off
many
a
prize
i
once
went
to
a
whitsuntide
revel
with
my
friend
and
partner
jesse
caster
of
upavon
and
i
believe
we
bore
off
every
prize
the
hat
the
wrestling
prize
the
hat
the
backsword
prize
a
pair
of
buckskin
breeches
the
prize
for
jumping
or
running
in
sacks
the
old
cheese
the
bowling
prize
and
eleven
the
prize
played
for
at
cricket
in
the
morning
indeed
i
and
caster
obtained
every
prize
and
as
i
gained
the
majority
of
course
i
had
the
choice
of
the
fairest
damsel
in
the
village
at
the
dance
in
the
evening
there
was
no
exercise
no
exertion
no
labour
that
ever
fatigued
me
i
could
and
did
often
work
all
day
and
dance
all
night
and
this
at
particular
festive
seasons
of
the
year
i
have
followed
for
a
week
or
ten
days
together
without
ever
taking
off
my
clothes
to
go
to
bed
there
was
no
excess
of
labour
heat
or
cold
winter
or
summer
that
ever
hurt
me
i
remember
once
going
up
stairs
about
ten
with
the
rest
of
my
father
family
but
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
dressed
myself
descended
the
window
by
a
ladder
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
to
upper
collingborn
where
i
had
been
invited
to
a
dance
a
distance
of
ten
miles
and
having
danced
till
three
in
the
morning
i
returned
home
mounted
the
ladder
into
the
window
and
had
just
changed
my
best
for
my
working
clothes
when
my
father
called
me
as
the
clock
struck
four
to
get
up
upon
which
i
was
out
the
first
of
the
family
time
enough
to
remove
the
ladder
before
any
one
saw
it
so
that
the
circumstance
was
never
known
to
any
one
the
young
parson
of
the
parish
was
generally
my
companion
on
these
occasions
but
as
he
was
his
own
master
he
went
to
and
returned
from
the
dance
at
his
leisure
in
fact
he
generally
got
too
top
heavy
before
the
evening
was
over
to
return
home
and
therefore
usually
slept
out
i
could
tell
some
of
the
most
ridiculous
stories
and
curious
adventures
that
happened
to
my
young
friend
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
bacchus
but
as
i
shall
have
occasion
to
say
a
great
deal
of
this
personage
hereafter
i
will
pass
it
over
for
the
present
but
as
from
my
having
lived
a
very
great
part
of
my
life
in
country
places
i
have
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
my
days
in
the
society
of
clergymen
and
as
it
is
one
of
my
principal
objects
in
giving
a
faithful
history
of
my
life
to
be
particular
in
shewing
my
readers
the
sort
of
society
that
i
kept
as
well
as
how
i
was
enabled
to
form
my
opinion
of
mankind
i
shall
faithfully
delineate
these
characters
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
always
taking
care
to
lean
on
the
charitable
side
and
to
draw
occasionally
a
veil
over
the
infirmities
of
human
nature
as
they
were
exemplified
in
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
i
understand
that
some
of
my
readers
have
already
attributed
to
me
a
desire
to
lower
the
character
of
the
clergymen
of
the
established
church
and
they
instance
my
description
of
the
character
of
the
rev
griffiths
the
master
of
the
free
grammar
school
at
andover
but
as
a
proof
that
i
have
not
done
him
any
injustice
i
have
had
confirmed
by
the
living
testimony
of
many
of
my
the
truth
as
well
as
the
lenient
description
that
i
gave
of
his
character
cotton
of
edgerly
my
tenant
and
steward
of
my
manor
of
glastonbury
has
been
to
see
me
since
be
read
the
account
and
he
says
it
is
a
most
faithful
picture
as
far
as
it
goes
but
he
called
to
my
recollection
the
tyrant
pedagogue
having
pulled
off
the
ear
of
two
boys
one
in
his
presence
and
one
in
mine
john
butcher
whose
father
then
lived
at
westcombe
was
one
of
them
and
he
has
reminded
me
also
of
griffiths
having
taken
a
very
thick
heavy
slate
and
with
both
hands
broken
it
over
the
head
of
now
sir
gibbs
of
bath
physician
to
the
late
queen
who
very
fortunately
had
a
thicker
scull
than
boys
in
general
or
he
would
in
all
probability
have
fractured
it
it
will
therefore
be
seen
that
i
did
in
no
way
exceed
the
truth
and
so
far
from
wishing
to
degrade
the
clergy
i
shall
only
reprobate
those
acts
in
which
they
degrade
themselves
i
have
known
many
excellent
clergymen
carrington
to
wit
and
i
know
many
most
worthy
clergymen
now
and
i
have
also
known
some
of
the
most
abandoned
of
human
beings
who
have
been
a
disgrace
to
that
holy
office
in
due
course
i
shall
shortly
detail
the
of
two
clergymen
of
this
diocese
as
a
specimen
of
human
depravity
both
of
them
living
under
the
nose
of
the
bishop
i
will
now
proceed
with
my
narrative
the
price
of
corn
was
by
this
time
considerably
enhanced
and
in
consequence
of
a
new
duty
malt
had
risen
from
to
a
bushel
labourers
three
years
before
could
purchase
with
a
week
wages
two
bushels
of
malt
and
a
pound
of
hops
enough
to
make
a
nice
little
cask
of
good
wholesome
beer
for
them
to
carry
with
them
into
the
field
in
grass
mowing
and
harvest
that
quantity
was
now
nearly
doubled
also
in
price
three
years
before
they
could
purchase
with
their
week
wages
twelve
quartern
loaves
they
could
now
only
purchase
with
their
week
wages
six
quartern
loaves
instead
of
twelve
the
quartern
loaf
having
now
risen
to
one
shilling
the
labourers
that
used
before
to
be
very
well
off
and
consequently
very
well
satisfied
complained
loudly
of
these
hardships
and
demanded
higher
wages
the
answer
of
the
farmer
was
it
is
very
true
that
we
sell
our
corn
for
a
much
higher
price
than
we
did
but
we
can
not
afford
to
raise
the
wages
of
the
labourers
for
we
pay
all
the
increase
of
price
away
in
taxes
and
the
increase
in
our
rents
as
well
as
in
every
other
necessary
of
life
our
tea
salt
iron
leather
you
must
therefore
have
patience
and
wait
for
better
times
our
rulers
and
pitt
particularly
says
we
may
look
forward
with
a
confident
hope
that
we
shall
soon
have
better
times
for
us
all
thus
the
poor
man
from
the
very
first
year
of
the
war
began
to
feel
the
cruel
effects
of
high
prices
and
he
was
made
to
suffer
this
for
many
years
without
any
rise
in
his
wages
almost
all
the
common
necessaries
of
life
were
doubled
while
he
was
told
to
wait
with
patience
from
day
to
day
from
week
to
week
from
month
to
month
and
from
year
to
year
still
buoyed
up
with
the
false
hope
of
better
times
which
were
eternally
promised
with
matchless
impudence
by
the
prime
minister
who
constantly
boasted
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
nation
which
he
was
wasting
and
which
he
lavished
with
an
unsparing
hand
to
carry
on
an
unjust
an
unnecessary
cruel
and
vindictive
war
against
the
people
of
france
because
they
had
made
a
hold
a
manly
and
a
successful
effort
to
throw
off
the
galling
yoke
of
one
of
the
most
infamous
and
detestable
tyrannies
that
ever
disgraced
the
character
of
an
enlightened
people
it
was
very
true
the
landholders
grew
rich
from
the
great
advance
in
the
price
of
land
and
the
farmer
grew
rich
from
the
advance
in
the
price
of
grain
but
alas
the
labourer
began
to
suffer
and
has
continued
to
suffer
his
privations
have
increased
in
the
exact
proportion
to
the
increase
of
taxation
from
that
day
to
this
in
the
beginning
of
this
year
of
april
the
prince
of
wales
was
married
to
his
first
cousin
the
princess
caroline
of
brunswick
a
match
which
was
very
much
approved
by
john
bull
as
she
was
young
and
beautiful
possessing
all
those
attractions
which
were
likely
to
render
the
marriage
state
happy
although
there
was
something
that
john
grumbled
a
little
about
as
he
had
not
only
to
pay
the
piper
by
an
additional
yearly
salary
for
his
royal
highness
which
was
raised
by
the
parliament
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
but
he
was
likewise
called
upon
to
the
prince
which
amounted
to
six
hundred
and
nineteen
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
debts
on
three
hundred
thousand
and
three
hundred
and
nineteen
thousand
pounds
was
the
amount
of
the
account
laid
before
parliament
john
however
was
then
in
comparative
prosperity
and
the
money
was
paid
with
great
good
humour
in
the
hope
that
this
wild
prince
would
now
he
was
married
to
an
amiable
and
a
lovely
woman
become
more
rational
and
less
debauched
and
extravagant
at
this
time
also
the
trial
of
hastings
was
brought
to
a
conclusion
this
had
been
going
on
seven
years
before
the
house
of
lords
and
he
was
now
acquitted
there
were
considerable
riots
and
disturbances
in
various
parts
of
the
country
in
consequence
of
the
high
price
of
corn
wheat
having
now
for
the
first
time
in
the
eighteenth
century
risen
as
high
as
ten
shillings
a
bushel
the
wages
of
the
labourer
in
the
parish
of
enford
still
remained
at
six
shillings
a
week
which
caused
much
grumbling
and
many
complaints
as
they
were
become
now
tired
of
waiting
with
patience
for
better
times
the
country
was
considerably
agitated
too
by
a
report
of
a
mutiny
in
the
oxford
militia
who
were
quartered
at
newhaven
in
the
neighbourhood
of
brighton
this
also
arose
in
consequence
of
the
high
price
of
provisions
the
privates
of
this
regiment
had
seized
a
quantity
of
flour
and
sold
it
to
their
comrades
and
others
at
a
reasonable
price
i
remember
that
this
caused
great
alarm
amongst
the
farmers
as
they
knew
that
without
the
aid
of
the
soldiers
they
would
not
be
able
to
keep
up
the
price
of
their
grain
the
riot
however
was
soon
quelled
and
those
concerned
in
it
were
tried
by
a
court
martial
many
of
them
were
severely
flogged
and
to
the
great
joy
of
the
yeomanry
two
of
them
cook
and
parish
were
shot
in
the
carrying
of
this
sentence
into
execution
there
were
great
doubts
entertained
by
many
of
the
officers
whether
the
other
regiments
of
militia
and
fencibles
which
were
in
camp
there
would
not
join
the
oxford
regiment
and
rescue
their
comrades
the
greatest
precautions
were
therefore
taken
the
prince
regiment
the
dragoons
was
marched
from
hounslow
and
windsor
where
it
was
stationed
to
perform
king
duty
the
men
had
ball
cartridges
served
out
to
them
and
they
were
drawn
up
in
the
rear
of
the
militia
regiments
which
were
all
flanked
by
the
artillery
with
lighted
matches
ready
to
rake
them
if
they
made
the
least
movement
and
the
light
dragoons
were
supported
by
the
lancashire
and
cinque
port
fencibles
but
the
sentence
was
executed
without
any
resistance
on
the
of
june
the
riot
having
occurred
on
the
of
may
i
mention
this
circumstance
because
it
caused
great
agitation
throughout
the
country
and
because
i
am
enabled
to
speak
of
the
particular
facts
from
the
information
which
i
receive
from
him
who
is
now
acting
as
my
servant
and
who
was
present
doing
his
duty
as
a
corporal
of
the
said
regiment
of
dragoons
in
which
regiment
he
was
a
warrant
officer
for
many
years
and
i
find
his
information
as
to
these
matters
most
valuable
to
me
gracious
god
what
scenes
has
he
been
an
of
this
persecuted
man
was
promoted
to
the
regiment
of
dragoons
commanded
by
charles
stewart
the
brother
of
lord
castlereagh
from
thence
he
was
removed
or
rather
removed
himself
and
was
made
adjutant
to
the
somersetshire
volunteers
which
were
commanded
by
hiley
addington
the
brother
of
lord
sidmouth
but
having
detected
his
commanding
officer
and
exposed
his
peculations
he
was
dismissed
without
a
court
martial
and
by
persecutions
driven
to
that
extremity
which
sent
him
here
he
has
indeed
a
tale
unfolded
to
me
enough
to
harrow
up
the
soul
of
any
one
who
has
not
the
heart
of
a
savage
i
now
know
what
were
the
feelings
of
the
british
soldiers
even
at
that
epoch
having
arrived
at
that
period
of
life
which
may
fairly
be
called
manhood
i
felt
an
interest
in
all
the
political
occurrences
of
the
day
and
had
by
means
of
the
society
of
our
worthy
curate
carrington
been
enabled
pretty
clearly
to
judge
of
the
views
of
the
different
political
parties
and
factions
in
the
country
i
was
a
most
decided
advocate
for
the
general
measures
of
the
government
although
i
abhorred
some
of
the
tyrannical
acts
of
the
ministers
i
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
our
beautiful
constitution
the
history
of
which
i
read
at
that
time
with
great
avidity
believing
that
it
was
in
all
its
material
points
carried
practically
into
effect
notwithstanding
my
friend
and
tutor
had
so
strenuously
endeavoured
to
convince
me
that
it
was
only
the
theory
that
deserved
any
admiration
about
this
time
a
great
many
public
meetings
were
held
and
a
clamour
for
peace
was
very
general
throughout
the
country
and
when
the
king
went
to
open
the
parliament
he
was
grossly
insulted
hissed
hooted
groaned
at
and
pelted
and
one
of
the
glasses
of
the
state
carriage
was
broken
supposed
to
have
been
done
with
a
ball
from
an
five
hundred
of
the
tenth
dragoons
escorted
his
majesty
from
windsor
to
piccadilly
where
the
whole
regiment
of
the
fifteenth
dragoons
was
assembled
to
conduct
the
king
to
the
house
of
peers
to
open
the
parliament
after
the
fifteenth
had
relieved
the
tenth
it
returned
from
piccadilly
and
halted
at
knightsbridge
barracks
which
were
then
first
occupied
by
it
the
men
had
orders
to
remain
in
readiness
the
whole
night
with
their
horses
standing
saddled
and
they
themselves
sleeping
in
the
stable
with
them
that
was
the
first
time
the
king
had
ever
been
escorted
by
more
than
a
guard
and
i
think
we
may
set
it
fairly
down
that
from
that
time
the
laws
of
england
have
been
passed
under
the
protection
and
the
influence
of
the
military
this
enabled
pitt
to
execute
measures
hostile
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
two
bills
were
immediately
passed
one
to
prevent
seditious
meetings
and
the
other
called
lord
grenville
gagging
bill
the
british
minister
was
in
fact
become
the
ruler
of
the
destinies
of
europe
he
had
contrived
by
means
of
british
gold
to
procure
in
france
the
committal
of
the
most
atrocious
and
bloody
deeds
that
human
nature
is
capable
of
and
this
was
inhumanly
effected
in
order
to
delude
mankind
with
the
idea
that
any
change
in
the
form
of
any
government
however
bad
and
tyrannical
must
always
be
followed
by
such
deeds
in
this
he
was
too
successful
for
by
these
means
alone
he
was
enabled
to
alarm
the
timid
disgust
the
more
rational
and
prevail
upon
the
great
mass
of
his
suffering
countrymen
to
submit
to
these
arbitrary
acts
and
to
endure
their
present
ills
however
galling
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
greater
by
a
change
this
was
the
policy
of
the
british
ministry
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
all
the
atrocities
that
had
been
committed
in
paris
all
the
blood
that
had
been
spilt
all
the
massacres
that
had
been
perpetrated
were
hired
and
paid
for
by
british
gold
drawn
from
the
pockets
of
the
gulled
and
besotted
people
for
the
purpose
as
they
were
made
to
believe
of
preventing
the
commission
of
similar
atrocities
in
our
own
country
in
fact
the
labour
the
industry
and
the
talent
of
the
people
the
industrious
and
people
of
england
were
now
heavily
taxed
to
subsidize
every
despot
of
the
continent
and
the
wealth
of
the
nation
drawn
from
the
sweat
of
the
poor
man
brow
was
squandered
with
a
lavish
hand
to
hire
and
to
pay
every
assassin
and
every
cut
throat
by
trade
in
europe
to
enable
them
to
prolong
the
war
against
the
liberties
of
france
and
thereby
to
prevent
a
reform
and
redress
of
grievances
at
home
in
the
mean
time
the
national
convention
of
france
were
boasting
of
their
victories
it
was
asserted
that
they
had
gained
pitched
battles
taken
one
hundred
and
sixteen
strong
places
thousand
prisoners
and
three
thousand
eight
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
during
this
year
the
son
of
lewis
the
sixteenth
died
in
prison
and
on
the
of
july
the
army
of
emigrants
which
landed
at
quiberon
bay
was
totally
destroyed
a
most
curious
circumstance
also
happened
hanover
made
peace
with
france
so
that
our
amiable
allies
the
good
people
of
hanover
made
peace
with
the
king
of
england
most
deadly
enemy
it
was
also
in
this
year
that
stanislaus
king
of
poland
resigned
his
crown
and
his
kingdom
was
partitioned
among
his
rapacious
neighbours
austria
prussia
and
russia
this
year
was
a
very
turbulent
one
for
great
britain
there
being
riots
in
many
parts
of
the
kingdom
in
consequence
of
the
high
price
of
bread
the
quartern
loaf
of
which
continued
above
a
shilling
during
the
whole
year
at
salisbury
symptoms
of
rioting
broke
out
one
market
day
some
of
the
farmers
attending
the
market
were
hustled
and
insulted
some
of
the
sacks
of
corn
were
also
cut
by
the
rioters
and
the
corn
let
about
the
marketplace
and
the
cornet
of
the
everley
troop
of
cavalry
william
dyke
of
syrencot
near
amesbury
one
of
the
largest
farmers
in
the
west
of
england
who
attended
the
market
at
salisbury
with
his
corn
was
insulted
and
by
the
people
the
windows
of
his
carriage
were
broken
and
the
vehicle
was
otherwise
injured
as
he
was
escaping
out
of
the
town
towards
his
home
in
the
afternoon
the
antipathy
of
the
people
was
directed
towards
him
particularly
because
he
had
been
very
instrumental
in
causing
the
of
the
winchester
measure
of
eight
gallons
to
be
introduced
generally
in
the
county
of
wilts
instead
of
the
old
bushel
which
contained
nine
gallons
and
in
some
instances
ten
gallons
my
father
district
contained
full
ten
gallons
and
when
the
little
bushel
was
established
four
of
our
bushels
made
exactly
five
of
the
winchester
measure
such
was
the
aversion
of
my
father
as
well
as
of
myself
to
the
new
regulation
that
when
the
law
was
enforced
to
compel
every
one
to
use
it
even
then
we
ever
afterwards
to
this
day
put
bushels
into
each
sack
so
that
they
were
always
of
the
same
size
and
weight
as
they
were
before
the
measure
was
altered
however
dyke
our
cornet
was
singled
out
on
account
of
his
being
the
in
what
the
poor
called
a
conspiracy
to
lessen
the
size
of
the
bushel
and
at
the
same
time
to
keep
up
the
price
of
corn
the
mob
as
they
pelted
his
carriage
with
brick
bats
as
his
horses
galloped
or
rather
fled
through
the
town
intimated
that
if
he
came
the
next
week
they
would
serve
him
still
worse
this
was
a
great
offence
and
which
was
not
to
be
borne
to
pelt
dyke
the
gallant
cornet
of
the
everly
troop
was
such
a
heinous
and
daring
outrage
that
it
could
not
consistently
with
our
honour
be
suffered
to
pass
with
impunity
and
every
one
in
the
neighbourhood
was
made
to
tremble
for
the
fate
of
the
rioters
every
member
of
the
troop
and
i
of
course
among
the
rest
received
a
formal
summons
to
be
in
readiness
to
join
on
the
following
tuesday
to
march
to
salisbury
to
quell
any
riot
that
might
take
place
and
at
all
events
to
guard
our
gallant
commander
dyke
while
he
went
to
the
market
to
sell
his
corn
for
it
was
very
properly
considered
that
in
case
the
cornet
of
a
troop
of
yeomanry
was
allowed
to
be
deterred
from
attending
the
market
to
sell
his
grain
no
farmer
would
in
future
be
able
to
attend
without
being
in
danger
not
only
of
losing
his
corn
but
of
having
his
head
broken
into
the
bargain
the
thing
got
wind
and
was
the
general
topic
of
conversation
all
over
that
part
of
the
county
the
rioters
had
publicly
intimated
their
intention
of
assembling
on
the
next
market
day
at
salisbury
and
compelling
the
farmers
to
sell
their
corn
at
a
moderate
price
or
abide
by
the
consequences
and
it
was
blazoned
all
over
the
country
that
the
everly
troop
had
received
orders
and
meant
to
march
to
salisbury
on
that
day
to
join
the
salisbury
troop
for
the
purpose
of
chastising
the
temerity
of
the
disorderly
multitude
the
bloody
conflict
that
was
anticipated
caused
many
a
manly
heart
to
palpitate
and
many
a
rosy
cheek
to
lose
its
blooming
colour
and
to
be
overspread
with
a
pale
sallow
hue
the
mighty
battles
that
had
caused
such
a
sensation
throughout
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
the
terrors
that
had
been
created
by
the
combats
which
had
been
fought
by
by
by
and
all
the
other
great
generals
upon
the
continent
were
entirely
forgotten
or
thought
but
little
of
in
the
vicinity
of
amesbury
and
everly
nothing
was
talked
of
or
meditated
upon
but
the
expected
dreadful
battle
of
salisbury
the
quivering
and
almost
bloodless
lip
of
every
one
who
ventured
to
speak
upon
the
subject
showed
visible
signs
of
terror
and
dismay
every
face
indeed
seemed
to
give
dreadful
note
of
preparation
this
was
my
first
campaign
and
as
it
was
the
only
opportunity
i
ever
had
of
distinguishing
myself
in
the
active
service
of
my
country
in
this
way
as
a
soldier
and
as
a
volunteer
yeomanry
cavalry
man
too
i
must
entreat
the
indulgence
and
particular
attention
of
the
gentle
reader
while
i
give
a
faithful
narrative
an
unvarnished
tale
of
the
whole
affair
this
being
the
solitary
instance
in
which
i
was
called
into
the
field
of
battle
while
i
was
in
the
service
i
must
entreat
those
who
do
me
the
honour
to
read
my
memoirs
to
extend
their
forgiveness
to
me
if
i
should
prove
somewhat
tedious
but
to
my
fair
readers
my
female
friends
i
will
promise
before
hand
that
there
shall
be
no
description
of
the
bloody
work
of
war
i
will
faithfully
relate
the
particulars
as
they
actually
occurred
without
fear
or
favour
being
willing
to
take
my
share
of
the
honour
as
well
as
the
odium
of
the
fate
of
war
it
will
be
recollected
that
dyke
was
only
a
cornet
as
yet
in
the
troop
and
of
course
it
was
contemplated
as
is
usual
upon
these
occasions
amongst
the
subalterns
of
the
army
previous
to
an
engagement
that
in
case
of
a
warm
contest
there
would
be
promotion
dyke
or
rather
cornet
dyke
rode
over
early
on
the
wednesday
following
to
captain
astley
to
inform
him
of
what
had
happened
and
requested
him
to
give
an
order
for
the
summoning
of
the
troop
to
muster
on
the
following
tuesday
and
the
place
of
rendezvous
was
fixed
at
the
cornet
house
as
that
was
on
the
road
to
salisbury
the
gallant
captain
complied
immediately
and
the
orderly
man
was
hurried
off
to
inform
the
different
members
of
the
corps
in
time
that
they
might
be
prepared
and
well
equipped
by
the
important
day
so
that
we
had
all
of
us
nearly
a
whole
week
to
ponder
upon
the
probable
chances
of
the
impending
conflict
the
whole
week
was
spent
in
surmises
how
it
would
all
end
some
longed
for
the
fray
others
as
i
have
since
understood
were
preparing
for
the
worst
and
occupied
their
time
in
settling
their
worldly
affairs
so
that
making
of
wills
was
the
best
trade
going
for
that
week
my
father
who
knew
all
the
parties
well
kept
up
his
spirits
for
he
at
once
confidently
asserted
that
there
would
be
no
blood
spilt
while
the
troop
was
under
the
command
of
his
neighbour
captain
astley
and
he
really
carried
his
jokes
so
far
that
i
was
sometimes
almost
disposed
to
be
angry
myself
ah
my
dear
boy
he
used
to
say
it
is
very
well
for
you
that
our
friend
carrington
in
gone
to
berkeley
castle
for
if
he
were
here
he
would
laugh
till
his
sides
cracked
to
hear
what
is
going
on
i
demanded
why
so
why
said
he
your
gallant
captain
is
run
away
already
he
is
to
the
fact
was
that
as
soon
as
dyke
had
left
the
captain
he
called
his
favourite
servant
without
whose
advice
he
never
did
any
thing
at
that
time
and
having
related
the
object
of
cornet
dyke
visit
he
said
what
say
you
douse
to
this
affair
why
replied
douse
damn
the
cornet
he
is
got
into
the
scrape
and
let
him
get
out
of
it
himself
in
the
best
way
he
can
douse
gave
this
advice
more
for
the
safety
of
his
own
carcase
than
for
the
honour
of
his
master
for
douse
who
was
the
groom
and
the
constant
attendant
of
the
captain
fancied
that
he
himself
began
to
smell
powder
already
besides
he
knew
his
man
well
and
he
knew
that
his
advice
would
be
acceptable
he
was
right
in
his
calculation
for
the
captain
drawing
himself
up
said
right
you
are
right
douse
damn
the
fellow
as
you
say
let
him
fight
his
own
battles
and
get
out
of
his
own
scrapes
as
well
as
he
can
but
what
shall
i
do
douse
what
excuse
shall
i
make
o
says
douse
order
your
carriage
and
go
to
boreham
and
then
you
know
you
will
be
from
home
and
that
will
be
a
sufficient
excuse
a
beam
of
pleasure
sparkled
in
the
captain
eye
and
he
at
once
adopted
the
faithful
groom
and
valet
advice
he
then
wrote
to
sir
john
methuen
poore
the
lieutenant
and
honestly
told
him
that
as
he
was
not
concerned
in
dyke
keeping
up
the
price
of
his
wheat
he
should
not
attend
at
salisbury
as
he
was
going
to
boreham
where
he
had
particular
business
boreham
was
near
warminster
not
more
than
miles
from
salisbury
and
everly
was
miles
however
it
was
soon
buzzed
about
that
the
captain
was
from
home
and
that
he
gone
to
which
was
ever
afterwards
a
amongst
the
members
of
the
troop
when
any
one
had
sneaked
out
of
performing
his
duty
the
exclamation
then
was
he
gone
to
boreham
sir
john
poore
took
the
hint
and
wrote
to
his
friend
cornet
dyke
to
say
that
he
had
particular
business
that
required
his
presence
in
london
where
he
was
going
the
next
day
this
desertion
in
the
hour
of
danger
of
our
captain
and
our
lieutenant
flew
like
lightning
through
the
district
and
i
shall
never
forget
my
father
when
he
related
the
latter
circumstance
to
me
he
could
not
get
it
out
for
the
life
of
him
for
laughing
however
said
he
you
have
got
the
cornet
left
and
he
is
a
and
i
warrant
you
there
is
no
harm
will
come
to
any
of
you
at
length
the
awful
morning
arrived
and
by
this
time
i
really
had
imbibed
a
great
deal
of
my
father
notion
of
the
thing
and
began
to
think
that
it
would
after
all
turn
out
very
little
better
than
a
hoax
or
something
for
the
public
to
laugh
at
i
own
i
did
not
like
the
object
of
the
expedition
much
neither
did
i
relish
the
idea
of
going
to
draw
my
sword
upon
a
defenceless
unarmed
multitude
but
my
father
turned
it
all
into
ridicule
he
said
we
were
only
frighteners
and
he
quoted
first
some
farwell
lines
of
pope
homer
addressed
by
hector
to
andromache
before
he
went
out
to
meet
achilles
then
he
quoted
hudibras
and
then
he
would
give
a
few
lines
of
the
character
of
falstaff
the
then
again
of
bobadil
the
fatal
day
was
however
come
and
i
mounted
in
good
time
to
proceed
to
the
rendezvous
at
our
cornet
house
at
syrencot
as
i
rode
along
with
some
of
my
comrades
i
could
not
avoid
cracking
a
few
jokes
about
the
nature
of
our
expedition
and
the
service
on
which
we
were
about
to
be
employed
i
shall
never
forget
the
serious
or
rather
gloomy
appearance
of
my
neighbour
and
friend
honest
john
coward
of
longstreet
his
naturally
long
dark
visage
was
extended
to
a
more
than
usual
length
and
the
tender
pathetic
way
in
which
he
took
leave
of
jenny
at
the
door
as
he
mounted
his
charger
was
a
genuine
specimen
of
the
mock
heroic
at
length
he
entreated
me
not
to
make
fun
of
such
a
momentous
and
solemn
undertaking
then
fetching
a
deep
sigh
he
said
he
prayed
to
god
that
it
might
all
end
well
and
that
no
lives
might
be
lost
in
this
mood
we
arrived
in
front
of
cornet
dyke
house
where
we
found
the
horses
being
led
about
of
some
few
of
the
troop
who
had
got
there
before
us
being
invited
to
alight
and
take
some
refreshment
we
dismounted
and
gave
our
horses
to
the
care
of
the
men
who
were
attending
in
considerable
numbers
for
the
purpose
of
walking
them
about
while
we
regaled
ourselves
they
were
the
and
other
of
our
cornet
and
as
they
well
knew
the
errand
upon
which
we
were
going
they
eyed
us
with
no
slight
degree
of
suspicion
and
we
had
to
be
sure
lost
our
and
our
but
we
consoled
ourselves
with
the
idea
that
we
had
got
our
cornet
safe
that
he
could
not
run
away
and
leave
us
in
the
lurch
although
my
friend
coward
had
thrown
out
some
dark
hints
as
we
came
along
by
which
it
appeared
to
me
that
there
was
a
hope
in
his
mind
that
something
yet
turn
to
prevent
us
from
marching
at
once
to
and
to
and
i
could
see
plainly
enough
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
forego
all
the
flattering
rewards
of
the
latter
if
he
could
only
be
sure
of
escaping
from
the
former
when
we
entered
the
house
we
found
such
of
our
comrades
as
had
arrived
before
us
seated
round
a
table
enjoying
a
handsome
cold
collation
which
was
spread
thereon
for
the
occasion
there
was
cold
ham
fowls
tongue
tea
coffee
wine
and
beer
in
great
profusion
and
if
i
recollect
right
there
were
no
less
than
three
rooms
furnished
with
the
same
substantial
proof
of
our
cornet
hospitality
so
that
as
he
arrived
each
member
of
the
troop
was
provided
with
a
liberal
allowance
of
good
old
english
cheer
this
being
the
first
time
that
our
hero
had
ever
given
a
treat
of
any
sort
to
the
troop
it
was
hailed
by
some
as
an
auspicious
omen
and
i
could
not
help
observing
to
my
next
neighbour
at
the
table
who
was
william
butcher
junior
that
the
which
had
been
levelled
at
our
cornet
bead
had
at
all
events
opened
an
avenue
to
his
heart
a
general
laugh
was
caused
by
this
remark
though
it
drew
on
us
a
reprimand
from
butcher
uncle
who
was
a
sergeant
i
also
observed
to
butcher
that
my
friend
and
neighbour
coward
not
only
played
a
good
knife
and
fork
but
did
ample
justice
to
the
an
unusual
flush
about
the
gills
shewed
indeed
that
his
blood
was
beginning
to
circulate
pretty
rapidly
and
by
the
time
he
had
taken
another
glass
or
two
he
began
to
talk
big
and
crack
his
jokes
with
the
best
of
us
as
some
of
the
party
in
endeavouring
to
keep
up
their
spirits
were
already
half
seas
over
pinkey
now
very
properly
interposed
and
as
every
one
had
taken
what
was
at
least
quite
sufficient
the
things
were
removed
and
we
began
to
look
at
our
watches
which
showed
us
that
time
was
gliding
pretty
quickly
away
and
that
we
ought
to
recommence
our
march
on
our
entrance
we
had
been
desired
by
the
servants
to
make
ourselves
welcome
but
our
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
having
waited
a
considerable
time
i
took
the
liberty
to
ring
the
bell
and
desire
the
servant
to
inform
his
master
that
we
were
all
in
readiness
to
start
and
waited
only
for
our
commander
although
generally
speaking
this
was
considered
as
very
proper
yet
some
of
the
older
members
thought
it
was
very
impertinent
in
who
was
a
mere
stripling
at
the
time
the
servant
went
up
stairs
to
deliver
the
message
but
still
we
remained
without
an
answer
and
my
new
acquaintance
william
butcher
having
whispered
to
me
loud
enough
for
many
of
our
comrades
to
hear
that
he
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
our
leader
come
forth
like
hamlet
ghost
armed
in
complete
steel
this
was
received
by
some
with
a
by
the
more
discreet
with
a
still
however
no
cornet
appeared
at
length
in
spite
of
sour
looks
and
rebukes
i
rang
the
bell
once
more
and
begged
the
servant
to
let
us
know
whether
his
master
was
coming
or
not
all
my
father
observations
now
came
forcibly
across
my
mind
i
began
to
thing
that
his
quotations
from
hudibras
and
shakespeare
had
too
much
truth
in
them
and
i
prepared
myself
for
some
extraordinary
conduct
on
the
part
of
our
commander
it
was
well
i
did
so
amazed
indeed
should
i
have
been
my
last
message
had
the
desired
effect
after
we
had
been
anxiously
waiting
for
more
than
an
hour
the
door
at
length
opened
and
in
walked
the
but
instead
of
being
dressed
in
he
had
not
even
got
on
his
to
our
utter
astonishment
confusion
and
dismay
instead
of
marching
firmly
forth
armed
with
nodding
plume
and
his
bright
and
trusty
steel
girt
round
his
loins
eager
for
the
fight
lo
and
behold
he
crept
slowly
and
solemnly
along
clad
in
a
flannel
dressing
gown
and
a
pair
of
scarlet
notwithstanding
all
my
father
had
prepared
me
for
this
scene
so
far
surpassed
all
that
his
ridicule
had
anticipated
that
i
can
solemnly
aver
that
i
had
never
before
felt
such
a
sensation
and
as
i
have
never
since
felt
any
thing
like
it
i
am
totally
unable
to
describe
my
feelings
we
were
all
struck
motionless
and
every
one
as
he
involuntarily
rose
appeared
to
dart
a
look
of
eager
enquiry
without
being
able
to
open
his
lips
the
trembling
at
length
broke
silence
and
in
a
faultering
under
tone
he
spoke
or
rather
whined
as
follows
gentlemen
i
am
very
sorry
for
having
kept
you
waiting
so
long
one
of
the
troop
who
had
been
plying
the
cornet
old
stingo
pretty
freely
interrupted
him
in
a
voice
as
opposite
to
that
of
the
cornet
as
the
roaring
of
a
cannon
is
to
the
chirping
of
a
cricket
and
replied
never
mind
sir
about
any
apology
but
put
on
your
regimentals
as
fast
as
you
can
or
we
shall
get
to
salisbury
after
all
the
mischief
is
done
the
cornet
proceeded
i
am
very
sorry
gentlemen
it
is
very
unlucky
but
about
three
this
morning
was
suddenly
seized
with
such
a
violent
pain
in
my
that
dyke
says
it
will
be
very
imprudent
for
me
to
leave
the
house
my
present
for
fear
of
catching
cold
and
in
fact
think
so
and
she
insists
upon
it
that
i
shall
not
go
with
you
in
the
midst
of
this
affecting
scene
i
too
was
seized
suddenly
but
in
rather
a
different
way
for
an
appropriate
couplet
which
my
father
had
repeated
in
the
morning
and
with
which
i
was
very
angry
then
now
came
so
forcibly
across
my
memory
that
not
being
able
to
suppress
my
feelings
i
burst
out
into
what
is
vulgarly
called
a
in
which
i
was
joined
by
butcher
and
some
of
my
comrades
the
poor
cornet
however
pitiously
proceeded
as
well
as
a
man
could
do
with
such
a
belly
and
said
that
he
really
was
very
sorry
for
it
but
as
it
could
not
be
helped
now
he
trusted
that
we
would
proceed
under
the
command
of
pinkney
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
we
should
conduct
ourselves
in
a
manner
that
would
do
credit
to
the
troop
he
added
that
he
would
send
a
servant
with
us
who
would
return
and
let
him
know
how
matters
stood
and
in
case
his
presence
was
absolutely
necessary
he
would
endeavour
to
come
over
to
salisbury
in
his
carriage
that
dyke
would
permit
him
to
leave
heaven
and
earth
here
was
a
catastrophe
i
sincerely
believe
if
i
had
not
been
an
eye
witness
of
this
transaction
that
i
should
have
thought
to
this
hour
that
some
of
the
characters
drawn
by
shakespeare
were
ridiculously
absurd
and
unnatural
but
this
scene
in
real
life
so
far
exceeded
any
thing
i
had
ever
seen
represented
upon
the
stage
that
i
have
never
since
disputed
the
correctness
of
our
inimitable
bard
in
his
conceptions
of
human
nature
and
the
justice
with
which
he
has
delineated
its
various
characters
now
returned
up
stairs
to
his
inconsolable
lady
and
his
amiable
anxious
family
and
having
mounted
our
chargers
we
marched
off
towards
salisbury
with
the
at
our
head
as
we
rode
along
or
rather
marched
two
my
comrade
was
william
butcher
of
urchfont
with
whom
i
that
day
contracted
an
intimacy
which
lasted
as
long
as
we
remained
together
in
the
same
county
and
which
was
continued
by
a
friendly
intercourse
up
to
the
period
of
his
premature
death
a
few
years
back
we
were
passing
bulford
about
two
miles
before
we
reached
amesbury
when
we
observed
the
and
butcher
uncle
who
was
another
serjeant
in
deep
and
serious
conference
upon
which
i
exclaimed
by
butcher
your
uncle
and
pinkney
are
holding
a
council
of
war
and
i
will
bet
my
life
that
some
new
difficulty
will
arise
so
as
after
all
to
prevent
our
marching
to
the
scene
of
action
i
had
scarcely
spoken
the
words
before
our
fell
back
and
joined
myself
and
butcher
who
were
heading
the
troop
next
to
the
officers
and
pinkney
addressed
me
as
follows
we
have
been
considering
the
matter
over
hunt
and
butcher
thinks
that
we
are
proceeding
not
only
upon
a
hazardous
but
a
very
foolish
expedition
for
he
says
that
as
there
is
no
commissioned
officer
with
us
any
act
of
ours
will
in
the
eye
of
the
law
be
deemed
illegal
what
say
you
to
this
having
given
the
wink
to
my
friend
i
replied
as
follows
i
believe
that
serjeant
butcher
is
quite
right
as
to
his
law
and
that
in
case
any
person
should
be
killed
there
is
no
doubt
but
we
shall
every
man
jack
of
us
be
tried
for
murder
but
if
you
ask
my
opinion
i
am
for
proceeding
immediately
for
we
had
much
better
be
and
to
boot
than
live
to
be
pointed
at
as
fools
and
cowards
for
the
remainder
of
our
days
ah
exclaimed
serjeant
butcher
that
is
very
pretty
talking
for
you
young
fellow
but
we
are
too
old
to
be
caught
i
suppose
he
meant
in
such
a
way
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
at
amesbury
where
we
will
dine
and
in
the
mean
time
we
will
send
over
dyke
servant
to
salisbury
and
should
there
be
any
he
can
return
and
let
us
know
and
we
can
quickly
be
there
as
amesbury
is
only
seven
miles
from
thence
he
likewise
very
prudently
observed
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
foolish
to
march
there
to
create
a
riot
when
by
staying
away
all
danger
or
mischief
might
be
avoided
as
the
council
of
war
had
settled
the
business
all
my
sarcastic
observations
merely
tended
to
irritate
without
the
least
chance
of
changing
their
final
determination
and
we
therefore
gallantly
marched
into
amesbury
where
having
halted
in
front
of
purnell
house
the
sign
of
the
george
and
the
dragon
our
commander
gave
the
word
for
the
landlady
to
advance
from
whom
he
boldly
demanded
whether
she
thought
that
she
could
provide
beef
steaks
for
sixty
in
half
an
hour
as
the
troop
could
not
halt
longer
than
an
hour
they
being
extremely
anxious
to
reach
salisbury
purnell
who
was
an
excellent
landlady
as
well
as
an
excellent
woman
was
too
good
a
judge
of
business
to
turn
away
such
a
spanking
order
with
an
engaging
smile
she
replied
that
she
could
hardly
undertake
to
supply
us
all
with
beef
steaks
but
that
if
we
would
dismount
she
would
do
the
best
she
could
the
offer
was
hailed
and
accepted
without
further
ceremony
and
every
man
got
as
good
a
birth
for
his
horse
as
circumstances
would
admit
another
council
of
war
was
then
called
and
another
very
grave
question
was
discussed
with
all
the
solemnity
of
a
camp
scene
immediately
preceding
a
battle
this
momentous
question
was
how
much
each
man
should
be
allowed
to
drink
after
dinner
and
on
due
deliberation
it
was
at
length
resolved
and
proclaimed
aloud
that
every
one
might
take
what
beer
he
liked
at
dinner
but
that
no
person
should
take
more
than
a
pint
of
wine
after
dinner
the
reader
will
recollect
that
we
had
only
marched
about
miles
and
a
half
since
we
had
all
taken
such
an
exhilirating
luncheon
at
our
cornet
at
the
expiration
of
an
hour
the
steaks
were
pronounced
to
be
ready
and
we
all
fell
to
without
ceremony
purnell
at
that
time
brewed
her
own
ale
which
was
very
different
from
the
nauseous
and
deleterious
trash
that
is
now
supplied
to
such
houses
by
those
common
pests
of
society
as
many
of
the
young
farmers
belonging
to
the
troop
had
not
got
rid
of
the
effects
of
what
they
had
taken
at
their
luncheon
they
plied
the
tankard
of
good
old
nappy
freely
with
their
dinner
so
much
so
indeed
that
before
the
cloth
was
removed
there
were
never
less
than
eight
or
ten
talking
loud
at
a
time
and
long
before
each
man
had
finished
half
a
bottle
of
wine
of
the
troop
were
drunk
the
following
scene
ensued
two
of
the
gallant
heroes
being
deprived
of
the
chance
of
making
war
upon
the
old
women
and
boys
at
salisbury
who
had
the
week
before
pelted
their
cornet
actually
stripped
and
had
a
pitched
battle
all
command
was
at
an
end
the
fruitlessly
endeavoured
to
call
them
to
order
they
were
all
now
become
too
vain
and
too
valiant
to
be
under
the
controul
of
any
one
some
had
mounted
their
horses
and
swore
that
they
would
immediately
proceed
to
salisbury
as
they
were
sure
servant
was
killed
or
he
would
have
returned
long
before
others
were
grinding
their
swords
and
one
having
more
courage
or
more
wine
aboard
than
the
rest
was
actually
seen
setting
his
weapon
upon
the
hone
of
the
barber
of
the
place
but
as
the
servant
of
cornet
dyke
had
now
returned
to
say
that
it
was
all
peaceable
and
no
chance
of
a
riot
some
of
the
party
actually
proposed
to
march
over
to
salisbury
to
shew
that
they
were
not
as
there
was
and
the
major
part
of
the
troop
were
three
parts
drunk
it
only
required
a
captain
birley
to
lead
them
on
and
a
squire
hulton
to
give
the
word
to
have
caused
a
scene
in
which
though
it
would
not
have
been
equal
in
atrocity
and
cruelty
to
the
murders
of
the
of
august
at
manchester
the
blood
of
innocent
and
unarmed
although
misled
persons
might
and
in
all
human
probability
would
have
been
spilt
however
by
the
advice
of
myself
and
a
few
other
who
had
retained
our
senses
and
who
felt
degraded
in
our
own
estimation
by
the
whole
of
these
proceedings
the
ordered
all
present
to
be
dismissed
and
each
to
depart
to
his
home
in
the
best
way
he
could
this
was
done
but
the
whole
of
this
little
town
of
amesbury
was
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
drunken
and
ridiculous
proceedings
of
some
of
the
men
before
they
left
it
and
thus
ended
the
battle
that
was
to
have
been
of
salisbury
i
returned
to
my
father
thoroughly
abashed
and
ashamed
of
the
transaction
but
when
i
related
to
him
the
account
of
the
and
long
faced
i
really
thought
he
would
have
cracked
his
sides
with
laughing
and
as
i
had
entered
the
troop
against
his
wish
and
better
judgment
he
did
not
spare
me
in
some
of
his
remarks
and
now
said
he
young
man
i
hope
you
will
another
time
be
more
disposed
to
attend
to
the
advice
of
your
father
who
has
lived
so
many
years
longer
than
yourself
and
has
been
thereby
enabled
to
form
a
much
more
correct
judgement
of
mankind
than
you
can
possibly
do
but
added
he
that
wisdom
which
is
gained
by
experience
is
always
the
most
lasting
and
generally
the
most
advantageous
so
that
it
be
not
purchased
too
dear
i
own
i
did
not
profit
so
much
as
i
ought
to
have
done
by
the
sound
advice
of
such
an
excellent
father
but
as
he
used
frequently
to
say
as
an
excuse
for
any
indiscretion
of
mine
produced
from
the
enthusiasm
of
my
disposition
well
it
can
not
be
helped
there
is
no
putting
old
heads
upon
young
shoulders
this
was
not
only
very
liberal
in
him
but
perfectly
true
and
the
wise
supreme
has
very
properly
ordained
that
it
should
be
so
i
have
however
never
ceased
to
regret
my
own
imprudence
and
folly
in
not
listening
more
attentively
to
the
kind
advice
and
prudent
admonition
of
one
who
was
so
capable
and
so
anxious
to
bestow
it
upon
me
i
had
now
been
labouring
incessantly
in
my
avocations
on
my
father
farms
for
five
years
in
acquiring
a
competent
knowledge
of
and
clear
insight
into
the
farming
business
and
i
must
say
that
my
father
was
at
all
times
fully
disposed
to
give
me
credit
for
my
exertions
this
season
i
had
taken
upon
myself
to
make
one
of
five
mowers
who
cut
down
all
my
father
spring
corn
consisting
of
very
little
short
of
three
hundred
acres
of
barley
and
oats
it
being
a
perfectly
fine
harvest
season
we
had
not
the
whole
time
one
day
sufficiently
wet
to
stop
mowing
and
on
a
saturday
night
it
was
all
down
with
the
exception
of
one
piece
of
oats
consisting
of
seventeen
acres
and
a
half
a
very
heavy
crop
growing
upon
newly
broken
or
ground
on
saturday
night
i
proposed
to
my
partners
that
we
should
make
an
effort
to
cut
down
this
piece
of
oats
on
the
monday
although
it
lay
three
miles
and
a
half
from
home
adjoining
everly
field
this
was
thought
to
be
an
impracticable
undertaking
each
however
promised
to
be
there
by
four
in
the
morning
and
to
start
from
home
as
the
clock
struck
three
as
it
would
take
an
hour
to
walk
three
miles
and
a
half
with
the
scythes
on
their
backs
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
carry
my
scythe
and
that
i
should
bring
the
bottles
and
bag
upon
my
poney
on
the
sunday
i
was
engaged
to
dine
and
pass
the
day
at
heytesbury
a
distance
of
nearly
twenty
miles
from
my
father
house
where
i
was
going
to
meet
a
young
lady
who
was
on
a
visit
there
and
to
whom
i
was
betrothed
without
the
consent
of
my
father
how
this
betrothing
came
about
i
must
now
inform
my
readers
i
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
in
very
high
terms
of
miss
halcomb
the
daughter
of
his
old
acquaintance
wm
halcomb
who
kept
the
bear
inn
at
devizes
well
known
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
inns
between
london
and
bath
which
inn
had
been
previously
kept
by
the
late
lawrence
the
father
of
the
present
sir
thomas
lawrence
who
i
believe
was
born
there
my
father
was
always
talking
to
my
sisters
in
praise
of
the
industry
and
the
accomplishments
of
this
young
lady
particularly
when
any
thing
was
not
quite
so
well
managed
as
it
ought
to
be
he
would
then
exclaim
ah
how
much
better
miss
halcomb
would
have
done
it
my
eldest
sister
used
sometimes
to
reply
rather
petulantly
why
do
you
not
invite
this
lady
to
come
and
see
us
perhaps
i
should
then
be
enabled
to
acquire
some
of
her
talent
to
please
well
said
my
father
one
day
i
have
no
objection
you
shall
ride
with
me
and
call
upon
her
and
i
will
then
invite
halcomb
to
bring
his
daughters
and
return
the
visit
my
sister
agreed
to
this
and
as
she
herself
told
me
she
was
prepared
to
dislike
this
lady
merely
because
my
father
had
so
often
made
such
severe
comparisons
that
she
had
almost
become
a
bugbear
to
her
not
so
with
me
i
was
already
half
in
love
with
her
from
my
father
description
although
i
had
never
seen
her
and
upon
their
return
was
eager
to
know
when
we
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
her
family
the
day
however
was
not
fixed
at
that
time
but
a
remarkable
circumstance
ultimately
produced
the
so
much
interview
with
this
young
lady
and
i
own
i
had
made
up
my
mind
secretly
to
admire
her
person
as
much
as
from
my
father
description
i
admired
her
good
qualities
had
my
father
but
even
slightly
guessed
what
was
working
in
my
breast
he
would
never
have
invited
miss
halcomb
to
littlecot
he
having
a
much
higher
object
in
view
for
his
son
both
as
to
fortune
and
rank
it
is
rather
extraordinary
but
i
longed
excessively
to
see
this
lady
at
length
the
following
occurrence
led
to
the
event
which
i
had
anticipated
with
so
much
anxiety
my
father
had
ridden
to
london
and
taken
his
friend
coward
with
him
as
a
companion
on
their
return
having
started
early
on
a
sunday
morning
they
rode
as
was
my
father
custom
twenty
miles
before
breakfast
which
brought
them
to
the
windmill
at
salt
hill
they
rode
into
the
yard
and
having
called
for
the
hostler
the
landlord
botham
came
up
to
them
and
made
his
bow
having
learned
in
the
course
of
his
conversation
with
them
that
they
came
from
the
neighbourhood
of
devizes
he
enquired
if
my
father
knew
halcomb
who
kept
the
bear
inn
to
which
my
father
replied
that
he
not
only
knew
but
was
particularly
intimate
with
him
a
reply
which
led
to
a
more
familiar
conversation
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
breakfast
the
landlord
entered
the
room
and
invited
them
to
walk
into
the
garden
and
take
some
fruit
an
invitation
which
was
accepted
from
thence
they
had
a
full
view
of
windsor
castle
which
being
admired
by
coward
botham
enquired
if
they
had
ever
seen
windsor
the
answer
being
in
the
negative
well
gentlemen
said
he
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
to
dinner
i
will
take
you
over
in
a
chaise
shew
you
the
king
farms
the
queen
dairy
after
which
we
will
walk
over
the
castle
and
go
to
the
chapel
royal
where
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
all
the
royal
family
who
are
at
windsor
as
they
scarcely
ever
fail
in
fine
weather
to
attend
divine
service
coward
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
at
the
proposal
and
he
looked
with
anxious
expectation
for
my
father
answer
the
latter
replied
that
it
would
have
been
a
great
treat
to
him
particularly
to
have
inspected
the
king
farms
but
that
he
was
nevertheless
reluctantly
obliged
to
decline
this
polite
offer
as
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
reaching
home
the
next
morning
and
had
made
arrangements
for
sleeping
that
night
at
newbury
a
distance
of
nearly
forty
miles
from
salt
hill
much
too
far
for
their
horses
to
take
them
after
dinner
if
that
be
all
the
objection
you
have
replied
botham
we
will
soon
settle
that
i
will
send
a
steady
man
on
to
reading
with
your
horses
who
shall
get
them
well
cleaned
and
fed
and
after
we
have
seen
windsor
and
you
have
dined
and
taken
one
of
the
best
bottles
of
old
port
my
house
can
produce
and
drank
the
health
of
my
friend
halcomb
i
will
put
the
best
pair
of
horses
i
have
in
my
stables
to
a
post
chaise
in
which
you
shall
be
taken
to
reading
in
such
style
as
will
give
you
a
specimen
of
the
way
in
which
we
conduct
posting
at
the
london
end
of
the
bath
road
by
the
time
that
you
arrive
at
reading
your
horses
will
have
had
good
time
to
feed
and
will
be
fresh
to
take
you
on
to
newbury
as
early
as
you
have
named
coward
begged
my
father
to
accept
so
very
excellent
a
proposal
and
declared
that
it
would
not
only
be
a
great
deal
better
for
their
horses
but
a
great
accommodation
to
them
and
in
this
coward
was
very
sincere
for
he
did
not
altogether
like
my
father
long
rides
on
horseback
as
my
father
seldom
travelled
less
than
sixty
miles
a
day
when
upon
a
journey
but
my
father
who
was
a
man
of
the
world
looking
botham
firmly
in
the
face
said
i
assure
you
sir
that
your
proposition
staggers
me
a
little
your
offer
is
most
polite
and
very
generous
but
as
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
such
liberality
from
strangers
how
am
i
to
account
for
the
pressing
manner
in
which
you
have
offered
it
i
can
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
a
person
in
your
respectable
situation
can
have
any
unworthy
motive
but
you
must
excuse
me
for
declining
to
assent
to
your
proposition
unless
you
will
inform
me
in
what
way
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
returning
the
compliment
or
at
any
rate
point
out
some
probable
motive
that
has
induced
you
to
proffer
it
sir
said
botham
i
will
do
both
in
the
first
place
i
have
received
many
civilities
and
in
fact
great
acts
of
kindness
from
halcomb
which
as
he
has
never
been
here
i
have
never
had
an
opportunity
of
returning
i
have
therefore
seized
this
occasion
of
being
civil
to
one
of
his
friends
in
the
next
place
if
you
will
fix
a
day
when
i
can
meet
halcomb
and
his
daughters
at
your
house
i
will
pay
you
a
visit
in
return
with
pleasure
although
it
is
a
distance
of
sixty
miles
we
innkeepers
you
know
travel
not
only
expeditiously
but
very
cheaply
enough
said
my
father
give
me
your
hand
we
will
chearfully
place
ourselves
at
your
disposal
till
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
the
business
was
thus
settled
to
the
great
joy
of
poor
coward
who
was
almost
dumb
with
fear
lest
my
father
should
decline
such
an
opportunity
of
seeing
windsor
and
the
royal
family
to
windsor
they
accordingly
went
and
were
greatly
entertained
with
what
they
saw
which
was
every
thing
that
was
to
be
seen
about
the
castle
as
botham
was
well
acquainted
with
the
upper
servants
in
attendance
there
they
also
got
a
seat
at
the
chapel
royal
very
near
the
royal
family
and
having
spent
a
pleasant
day
botham
kept
his
word
by
conveying
them
in
a
post
chaise
to
reading
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
when
my
father
returned
he
related
this
circumstance
to
me
and
my
sisters
and
coward
overwhelmed
us
with
his
praises
of
botham
my
father
then
said
that
he
would
fix
an
early
day
for
halcomb
and
his
daughters
to
come
and
meet
him
coward
observed
that
he
must
have
a
very
great
regard
for
his
friend
to
travel
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
merely
to
dine
with
him
ah
coward
said
my
father
you
know
little
of
mankind
it
did
not
require
any
very
extraordinary
degree
of
penetration
to
discover
that
botham
entertained
a
greater
friendship
for
one
of
the
than
he
did
for
her
father
why
yes
replied
coward
i
now
remember
that
he
devoured
your
praises
of
miss
halcomb
with
great
avidity
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
my
father
botham
informed
me
that
he
wished
for
an
alliance
with
the
eldest
daughter
of
his
friend
and
as
i
think
it
a
good
match
and
salt
hill
will
be
an
excellent
home
for
her
i
will
do
every
thing
that
lies
in
my
power
to
promote
their
union
for
the
moment
this
information
was
death
to
my
hopes
and
seemed
to
strike
daggers
to
my
heart
for
i
was
literally
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
this
unknown
lady
merely
from
what
i
had
heard
my
father
say
of
her
but
as
i
could
not
learn
from
my
father
that
she
had
in
any
way
encouraged
the
hopes
of
botham
i
felt
after
a
little
reflection
no
fears
for
the
result
and
without
farther
consideration
resolutely
made
up
my
mind
to
be
his
rival
this
furnishes
a
striking
example
how
liable
young
persons
possessing
minds
of
a
sanguine
nature
are
to
be
talked
into
any
thing
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
party
and
my
poor
father
little
thought
that
his
son
who
could
not
by
any
process
of
reasoning
be
supposed
to
have
any
thing
more
than
the
common
feeling
which
actuates
the
minds
of
young
people
when
they
anticipate
meeting
some
friends
of
their
own
age
he
little
thought
that
his
son
looked
forward
to
the
day
with
a
much
more
intense
anxiety
than
either
of
the
individuals
that
he
expected
would
play
so
prominent
a
character
and
on
whose
account
the
party
was
solely
made
up
the
day
at
length
arrived
and
my
father
had
made
such
preparations
as
he
conceived
were
due
to
the
polite
attention
and
hospitality
that
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
botham
my
father
was
not
one
of
that
class
of
personages
who
are
so
very
common
and
who
pride
themselves
upon
being
match
makers
this
being
the
only
instance
in
which
i
ever
knew
him
to
interfere
in
any
thing
of
the
sort
but
he
nevertheless
really
appeared
to
enter
into
this
scheme
with
all
the
ardour
of
an
old
proficient
i
believe
however
that
he
did
it
with
the
best
of
motives
under
the
full
impression
that
he
was
serving
all
parties
as
it
struck
him
that
it
would
be
an
union
which
bid
fair
to
promote
the
mutual
advantage
and
happiness
of
the
two
families
the
reader
will
indeed
perceive
that
he
was
not
an
adept
in
the
art
of
match
making
as
had
he
been
so
he
certainly
would
not
have
communicated
the
secret
to
us
young
folks
the
dinner
hour
now
approached
and
a
chaise
drove
up
to
the
door
containing
the
two
miss
halcombs
accompanied
by
their
brother
on
horseback
my
father
having
introduced
them
to
me
halcomb
made
an
apology
for
the
absence
of
his
father
who
was
ill
and
presented
a
letter
which
had
been
sent
to
him
by
the
coach
from
botham
directed
for
my
father
the
latter
having
opened
and
read
it
he
looked
very
grave
and
disconcerted
and
said
addressing
himself
to
the
young
lady
i
am
very
sorry
to
inform
you
madam
that
i
find
by
this
letter
which
i
have
received
from
botham
that
we
shall
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
his
company
in
consequence
as
he
informs
me
of
his
unexpectedly
having
a
large
party
from
town
who
have
ordered
a
dinner
which
totally
precludes
the
possibility
of
his
leaving
home
this
caused
a
slight
blush
upon
the
cheek
of
miss
halcomb
who
very
modestly
replied
that
she
was
sorry
my
father
was
deprived
of
the
company
of
his
friend
but
looking
round
to
me
and
my
sister
she
added
with
a
smile
we
will
endeavour
to
bear
the
loss
with
fortitude
and
spend
the
day
as
pleasantly
as
we
can
without
him
it
might
have
been
very
natural
for
me
to
feel
an
inward
pleasure
at
the
absence
of
one
whom
i
had
expected
to
meet
as
a
rival
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
felt
very
differently
for
i
at
once
set
him
down
as
an
opponent
not
worth
contending
with
and
i
could
not
help
despising
him
for
his
want
of
gallantry
i
had
also
eagerly
watched
the
countenance
of
the
lady
to
endeavour
if
possible
to
collect
whether
this
botham
had
made
any
impression
upon
her
heart
or
not
and
from
the
apathy
which
it
manifested
i
felt
very
little
fear
on
his
account
my
father
was
sadly
mortified
at
the
circumstance
both
at
the
absence
of
his
old
friend
halcomb
and
his
new
acquaintance
botham
however
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
day
and
as
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
to
be
i
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
the
lady
my
attentions
in
fact
were
so
pointed
and
unreserved
that
i
saw
that
my
father
began
to
repent
that
he
had
ever
had
any
thing
to
do
with
match
making
i
found
miss
halcomb
not
only
to
possess
all
the
good
qualities
that
my
father
had
ever
described
but
in
my
estimation
she
possessed
ten
thousand
times
more
charms
than
my
fervid
imagination
previously
formed
my
attentions
were
received
with
that
politeness
which
was
becoming
an
amiable
a
virtuous
and
an
accomplished
female
on
the
first
interview
with
a
young
man
to
whom
she
had
never
given
one
thought
before
but
it
was
very
flattering
to
me
to
find
that
those
attentions
were
not
considered
obtrusive
or
disagreeable
i
perceived
that
my
father
sat
upon
thorns
and
that
he
was
very
much
pleased
to
find
that
the
young
ladies
declined
the
invitation
of
my
sister
to
remain
all
night
although
i
added
my
intreaties
to
those
of
my
sister
and
this
too
in
so
earnest
a
manner
that
my
father
could
not
refrain
from
saying
that
he
should
be
very
happy
if
the
young
ladies
would
remain
all
night
with
his
daughter
but
really
he
was
fearful
that
my
of
pressing
them
to
stay
would
be
considered
as
being
very
rude
notwithstanding
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
go
yet
i
could
see
that
they
were
not
offended
at
the
as
my
father
called
it
in
which
i
enforced
my
suit
i
enlarged
upon
the
darkness
of
the
evening
the
badness
of
the
roads
and
a
thousand
other
obstacles
which
i
presented
to
their
view
but
when
i
found
that
all
was
in
vain
i
seized
an
occasion
to
withdraw
while
they
were
at
tea
and
taking
off
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
chaise
i
conveyed
it
unobserved
into
the
rick
yard
where
i
secreted
it
under
some
straw
i
then
returned
and
took
my
leave
saying
that
i
had
an
appointment
to
meet
some
friends
at
a
neighbouring
fair
which
was
actually
the
case
then
mounting
my
horse
off
i
rode
it
happened
as
i
had
anticipated
when
the
horses
were
brought
out
to
be
put
to
the
chaise
the
boy
was
astonished
to
find
that
one
of
the
was
gone
and
as
it
was
a
physical
impossibility
for
any
one
to
find
it
that
night
the
young
ladies
were
obliged
to
accept
my
sister
offer
in
which
my
father
now
sincerely
joined
since
he
found
that
i
had
left
home
though
he
did
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
me
to
be
the
culprit
who
had
in
one
of
my
ridiculous
frolics
stolen
the
wheel
off
the
chaise
upon
my
return
i
was
charged
with
the
act
which
i
freely
confessed
assigning
as
an
excuse
my
fears
for
the
safety
of
the
young
females
travelling
such
bad
roads
in
such
a
dark
night
within
a
very
few
days
after
this
event
i
gained
miss
halcomb
consent
to
ask
her
father
permission
to
pay
my
addresses
in
form
and
within
a
week
from
that
time
i
demanded
her
hand
in
marriage
the
old
gentleman
however
very
properly
replied
that
although
he
had
no
objection
to
me
as
a
he
could
not
give
his
consent
to
any
such
hasty
measure
till
he
had
seen
my
father
to
know
if
it
met
with
his
approbation
i
frankly
told
him
that
he
might
save
himself
the
trouble
and
mortification
of
applying
to
my
father
who
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
my
attachment
to
miss
halcomb
and
that
i
had
offered
her
my
hand
and
heart
which
at
the
same
time
i
informed
him
she
had
kindly
accepted
had
thrown
himself
into
a
violent
passion
and
swore
that
unless
i
gave
up
my
prize
and
abandoned
all
further
intentions
of
marrying
an
innkeeper
daughter
he
would
disinherit
me
and
cut
me
off
with
a
shilling
this
was
quite
enough
to
fix
my
determination
and
i
at
once
told
old
halcomb
that
i
hoped
he
would
act
a
more
considerate
part
for
as
i
had
gained
his
consent
and
as
i
was
of
age
and
his
daughter
very
nearly
so
all
the
fathers
in
christendom
nor
all
the
powers
on
earth
should
prevent
me
from
making
her
my
wife
the
old
gentleman
very
clearly
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
endeavour
to
deter
me
from
my
purpose
by
vain
vows
or
threats
he
therefore
took
a
more
rational
course
he
endeavoured
to
win
me
over
by
persuasion
and
at
length
by
this
conciliatory
conduct
and
by
an
assurance
that
he
would
not
stand
personally
in
the
way
but
that
he
would
take
every
means
consistent
with
the
feelings
of
a
man
of
honour
to
soften
down
the
rigour
of
my
father
he
prevailed
upon
me
to
give
up
all
intention
of
taking
any
hasty
or
premature
step
which
might
involve
us
all
in
very
unpleasant
difficulties
this
was
a
course
which
was
sure
to
succeed
with
me
and
i
promised
him
that
i
would
do
nothing
without
his
knowledge
now
i
am
convinced
that
if
halcomb
had
acted
in
the
same
way
that
my
father
did
if
he
had
forbidden
me
his
house
and
endeavoured
by
force
to
prevent
my
access
to
his
daughter
such
was
my
spirit
of
opposition
such
an
abhorrence
had
i
of
being
into
or
out
of
any
measure
such
an
innate
hatred
had
i
of
every
thing
like
tyrannical
force
that
i
am
quite
sure
if
he
had
so
acted
i
having
got
the
lady
consent
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
have
run
away
with
her
in
a
week
in
spite
of
all
that
could
have
been
done
to
prevent
me
if
my
father
on
the
contrary
had
taken
a
similar
course
with
halcomb
if
he
had
kindly
advised
me
and
endeavoured
to
prevail
upon
the
by
mild
and
gentle
means
i
do
not
say
that
he
would
or
that
he
ought
to
have
succeeded
in
making
me
give
up
the
lady
but
i
am
quite
clear
that
he
would
have
had
a
much
better
chance
of
success
nay
if
he
had
appeared
careless
and
left
me
to
myself
i
was
at
that
time
of
such
a
volatile
disposition
that
such
a
hasty
attachment
might
possibly
have
been
weakened
or
it
might
have
worn
off
by
time
but
the
very
course
which
he
took
irrevocably
fixed
my
fate
as
to
marriage
i
was
of
age
and
i
had
always
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
and
ought
to
be
my
own
master
upon
this
subject
i
am
still
of
the
same
opinion
i
still
hold
that
parents
have
no
right
to
make
their
children
miserable
by
any
arbitrary
dictation
upon
a
question
of
such
vital
importance
as
that
of
whom
they
shall
marry
parents
have
an
undoubted
right
nay
it
is
an
imperious
duty
which
they
owe
to
their
children
to
direct
their
choice
with
respect
to
suitable
connections
and
they
have
a
right
to
interpose
the
authority
of
their
advice
and
recommendation
to
their
children
but
the
law
of
god
and
of
man
says
that
the
parties
about
to
be
united
ought
to
exercise
their
own
free
choice
the
law
says
that
no
person
shall
marry
who
is
under
age
without
the
consent
of
his
or
her
parents
and
the
law
has
very
justly
drawn
this
line
the
law
therefore
very
properly
contemplates
that
no
parent
shall
have
the
absolute
controul
over
the
person
of
a
child
in
this
matter
after
that
child
has
come
of
age
i
have
probably
detained
the
reader
much
longer
upon
this
subject
than
is
either
entertaining
or
edifying
but
as
this
occurrence
paved
the
way
for
that
important
part
of
my
history
my
marriage
i
feel
it
a
duty
which
i
owe
to
myself
and
to
those
who
do
me
the
honour
to
read
these
memoirs
and
more
particularly
to
the
radicals
to
be
more
explicit
than
i
otherwise
should
be
if
the
venal
press
and
particularly
the
profligate
editors
and
proprietors
of
that
press
in
order
to
gratify
their
political
employers
and
partisans
had
not
upon
so
many
occasions
and
with
such
brutal
and
savage
coarseness
when
they
could
neither
answer
my
arguments
nor
contradict
the
truths
that
i
promulgated
sought
to
cover
their
defeat
and
their
infamy
by
accusing
me
of
having
deserted
my
wife
and
left
her
to
starve
fearless
of
the
consequences
i
shall
therefore
as
i
go
along
place
the
circumstances
fairly
and
honestly
before
the
public
and
leave
them
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
as
to
the
correctness
not
to
say
any
thing
of
the
honesty
of
the
base
assertions
which
are
made
by
the
toots
of
my
political
adversaries
at
this
moment
however
i
will
merely
state
briefly
this
fact
that
in
the
year
more
than
eighteen
years
ago
i
was
separated
from
my
wife
by
mutual
consent
we
had
three
children
two
sons
and
a
daughter
it
was
agreed
that
the
daughter
should
live
with
the
mother
and
the
sons
with
me
but
that
both
mother
and
father
should
have
free
access
to
each
of
the
children
and
the
children
the
same
access
to
the
parents
and
as
i
made
a
most
liberal
settlement
upon
my
wife
the
particulars
of
which
i
shall
not
withhold
there
has
been
no
complaint
uttered
by
either
party
no
living
creature
ever
having
heard
me
make
even
the
slightest
insinuation
against
my
wife
or
ever
cast
the
most
remote
reflection
upon
her
character
or
conduct
neither
has
it
ever
come
to
the
knowledge
of
myself
or
any
of
my
friends
that
my
wife
has
spoken
one
disrespectful
word
against
me
as
we
have
both
always
lamented
as
a
misfortune
the
circumstances
which
led
to
our
separation
so
we
both
have
carefully
abstained
from
heightening
and
adding
to
the
poignancy
of
that
misfortune
by
mutual
accusations
revilings
and
recriminations
which
would
have
been
as
base
as
they
would
have
been
proved
to
he
unfounded
if
on
the
contrary
i
had
deserted
my
wife
after
having
when
i
was
first
married
surrounded
her
by
prostitutes
and
courtezans
if
i
had
been
intriguing
with
every
loose
and
abandoned
female
that
came
within
the
precincts
of
a
profligate
circle
if
after
having
driven
her
from
my
home
friendless
and
unprovided
for
if
after
having
personally
insulted
her
i
had
hired
spies
and
informers
to
traduce
her
character
if
i
had
employed
and
paid
the
most
abandoned
characters
and
had
suborned
them
to
swear
away
her
life
and
her
honour
if
when
this
plot
had
been
detected
and
exposed
and
her
innocence
had
been
proved
by
the
very
means
that
i
had
employed
to
blast
her
reputation
and
to
destroy
her
if
i
had
still
in
the
most
unfeeling
and
unnatural
manner
separated
her
from
and
cut
off
all
communication
with
her
child
under
the
hollow
and
false
pretence
that
she
was
not
a
proper
person
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
her
own
daughter
if
i
say
i
had
driven
her
out
of
the
country
and
having
done
this
if
i
had
hired
another
gang
of
base
villains
not
only
to
dog
and
watch
her
steps
but
to
seduce
and
bribe
her
servants
to
betray
her
if
i
had
rewarded
these
villains
with
my
own
to
fabricate
and
propagate
all
sorts
of
calumnies
against
her
abroad
while
their
infamous
agents
at
home
were
reiterating
and
magnifying
those
falsehoods
if
i
had
bribed
the
dastardly
hireling
press
to
libel
and
villify
her
if
in
fact
i
had
carried
my
persecutions
and
deadly
hatred
so
far
as
at
last
break
the
heart
of
her
if
upon
her
return
i
had
made
another
atrocious
attempt
to
destroy
her
by
means
of
hired
bribed
and
suborned
foreign
witnesses
if
i
had
done
these
things
or
any
of
them
i
should
have
been
an
execrable
and
detestable
villain
and
i
should
have
merited
the
scorn
of
every
man
and
woman
in
the
universe
but
even
then
even
if
i
had
been
guilty
of
all
these
horrible
and
unnatural
deeds
it
would
even
under
these
abhorrent
circumstances
have
been
base
in
the
extreme
in
the
villains
of
the
the
and
the
to
attack
me
in
the
way
they
have
repeatedly
done
about
my
wife
because
there
are
not
three
abandoned
profligate
monsters
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
even
the
perry
of
the
morning
chronicle
has
when
an
occasion
offered
endeavoured
to
varnish
over
his
own
character
by
attacking
me
about
my
wife
but
when
i
remind
perry
that
his
wife
or
at
least
the
person
he
called
one
of
his
wives
was
a
miss
hull
a
butcher
daughter
of
the
town
of
devizes
and
that
i
know
that
those
who
have
glass
heads
should
be
very
careful
how
they
throw
stones
i
trust
he
will
be
more
guarded
in
future
i
now
request
my
readers
to
accept
my
apology
for
this
long
digression
and
without
further
comment
i
will
resume
the
thread
of
my
narrative
i
have
now
introduced
the
reader
to
miss
halcomb
who
was
destined
to
be
my
wife
and
i
also
have
before
said
that
i
event
to
send
a
sunday
with
her
at
heytesbury
a
distance
of
nearly
thirty
miles
from
my
father
house
the
reader
will
recollect
too
that
i
had
engaged
with
my
father
mowers
to
meet
them
at
four
on
the
monday
morning
upwards
of
three
miles
from
home
in
order
to
attack
a
field
of
oats
of
seventeen
acres
and
a
half
a
very
heavy
crop
to
see
if
we
five
in
number
could
not
cut
them
down
the
same
day
the
time
however
passed
so
delightfully
and
so
rapidly
in
the
society
of
an
amiable
and
lovely
female
to
whom
i
was
betrothed
that
the
clock
had
unobserved
by
me
struck
twelve
more
than
half
an
hour
and
before
i
could
muster
up
resolution
enough
to
tear
myself
from
the
clear
object
of
all
my
hopes
the
respectable
family
with
whom
my
intended
wife
was
visiting
had
given
me
more
than
one
hint
of
its
being
past
their
usual
time
of
retiring
to
rest
however
upon
another
hint
being
given
by
the
prudent
matron
of
the
family
i
took
my
leave
and
having
mounted
my
faithful
steed
i
bent
my
course
over
the
downs
twenty
miles
across
salisbury
plain
as
i
quitted
the
village
or
rather
the
rotten
borough
of
heytesbury
the
church
clock
struck
which
for
the
first
time
recalled
to
my
recollection
the
promise
i
had
made
as
well
as
my
resolution
to
perform
an
uncommon
day
mowing
which
was
to
commence
at
miles
distance
at
four
with
a
heart
as
light
as
a
feather
i
reached
home
at
three
when
my
father
servant
informed
me
that
the
mowers
had
been
gone
forward
nearly
half
an
hour
and
that
they
had
left
the
bottles
to
be
filled
and
carried
to
the
field
by
me
finding
that
i
was
rather
behind
my
time
i
merely
then
pulled
off
my
coat
and
waistcoat
and
put
on
my
frock
i
did
not
wait
to
take
off
either
my
tight
leather
breeches
which
were
the
fashion
at
that
time
or
my
boots
but
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
filled
the
bottles
with
ale
i
mounted
a
poney
and
reached
the
field
of
oats
just
as
the
other
four
men
were
stripped
and
whetting
their
scythes
in
order
to
begin
a
thing
which
they
had
never
before
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
throughout
the
whole
harvest
as
the
first
stroke
was
uniformly
struck
by
myself
they
waited
while
i
threw
off
my
frock
and
took
off
my
spurs
and
having
unbuttoned
the
knees
of
my
breeches
we
set
to
and
in
ten
minutes
after
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
the
last
swarth
was
laid
flat
and
not
an
oat
left
standing
a
day
work
which
stands
unrivalled
in
that
country
and
which
is
the
more
uncommon
as
in
fact
there
were
only
four
scythes
at
work
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
for
it
being
excessively
hot
one
of
the
men
the
worst
mower
of
course
was
principally
employed
in
riding
to
and
from
the
inn
at
everly
to
replenish
the
bottles
this
was
indispensible
every
man
being
allowed
as
much
ale
as
he
could
drink
with
the
exception
of
the
two
last
bottles
containing
three
quarts
each
which
i
was
obliged
to
prohibit
from
being
tapped
till
the
oats
were
all
down
as
some
of
my
partners
by
this
time
began
to
discover
evident
symptoms
of
inebriety
as
we
finished
the
last
stroke
a
very
severe
flash
of
lightning
announced
the
approach
of
a
storm
which
had
been
gathering
for
several
hours
i
advised
the
men
to
hasten
home
but
they
declared
now
that
the
mowing
was
finished
they
would
finish
the
bottles
before
they
left
the
field
and
they
kept
their
words
i
hurried
home
as
fast
as
my
pony
could
gallop
and
got
in
doors
just
in
time
to
escape
one
of
the
most
tremendous
i
ever
witnessed
my
four
companions
got
jollily
drunk
and
slept
upon
the
open
down
drenched
in
rain
all
night
and
although
i
met
two
of
them
returning
home
the
next
morning
at
four
in
a
most
wretched
state
yet
such
was
their
hardy
nature
that
neither
of
them
took
the
least
cold
i
have
detailed
this
day
work
as
the
last
perhaps
of
the
sort
with
which
i
shall
trouble
the
reader
it
was
as
i
have
already
intimated
such
a
day
work
as
had
never
been
accomplished
by
five
mowers
before
or
has
been
since
in
that
part
of
the
world
and
it
will
be
recollected
that
i
performed
my
share
with
out
having
had
any
sleep
or
rest
but
to
me
at
that
time
i
never
appeared
to
want
any
rest
i
frequently
worked
till
ten
and
after
taking
my
supper
and
conversing
with
my
father
arranging
the
proceedings
for
the
next
morning
i
was
very
often
not
in
bed
till
after
eleven
yet
i
was
very
commonly
up
and
dressed
again
by
half
past
and
never
in
the
summer
time
was
in
bed
after
four
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
fact
that
those
who
labour
hard
in
the
fields
all
day
require
the
least
sleep
at
all
events
the
smallest
quantity
of
time
in
bed
for
when
they
get
thither
they
enjoy
and
receive
as
much
real
sleep
they
receive
as
much
real
refreshment
in
four
hours
as
the
indolent
the
idle
or
the
sedentary
do
in
double
the
time
when
the
mind
is
active
and
well
employed
i
now
find
it
has
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
laborious
bodily
exercise
for
i
sleep
as
sound
as
a
rock
here
and
when
my
mind
is
fully
occupied
and
kept
upon
a
proper
stretch
during
the
day
six
or
seven
hours
rest
in
bed
is
quite
ample
but
when
my
mind
is
less
employed
or
occupied
by
light
reading
and
not
exerted
in
its
usual
way
then
i
require
more
rest
in
bed
and
i
can
sleep
eight
or
even
nine
hours
it
is
however
very
seldom
indeed
that
i
give
way
to
such
negligence
and
sluggishness
i
go
to
rest
usually
between
eleven
and
twelve
and
i
am
always
up
before
seven
i
was
always
instructed
by
my
father
to
consider
indolence
as
one
of
the
greatest
faults
it
was
in
fact
a
sin
of
the
first
magnitude
in
his
indolence
he
always
said
was
the
harbinger
of
every
vice
of
every
evil
and
the
songs
of
solomon
and
his
proverbs
were
on
every
occasion
ready
to
support
his
opinion
he
would
say
to
the
sluggard
go
to
the
ant
thou
sluggard
consider
her
ways
and
be
wise
he
would
forgive
many
a
fault
in
a
servant
but
at
habitual
lyer
in
bed
he
would
get
rid
of
immediately
unless
he
could
break
him
of
the
bad
habit
my
father
for
some
time
was
very
positive
and
very
determined
to
prevent
me
from
marrying
an
innkeeper
daughter
and
at
length
i
undertook
to
reason
with
him
upon
the
subject
i
demanded
if
he
knew
any
thing
in
the
slightest
degree
affecting
the
character
of
the
young
lady
his
answer
was
no
quite
the
reverse
i
asked
if
he
had
not
at
all
times
and
perpetually
spoken
in
the
highest
terms
of
her
conduct
and
whether
he
had
not
in
my
hearing
held
her
up
as
a
pattern
of
propriety
and
an
example
to
my
sisters
all
this
he
admitted
to
be
true
but
she
had
no
fortune
and
he
had
expected
me
to
marry
a
lady
of
fortune
and
family
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
out
several
whom
he
should
have
been
pleased
to
acknowledge
as
his
i
then
demanded
whether
if
she
were
fit
to
be
held
up
by
him
as
a
pattern
for
his
daughters
she
were
likely
to
degrade
his
son
as
his
wife
but
then
she
had
no
fortune
and
she
was
an
innkeeper
daughter
i
begged
then
to
know
if
he
had
any
thing
to
urge
against
her
father
no
indeed
he
was
a
truly
honourable
and
upright
man
then
i
would
reply
how
often
sir
have
i
been
taught
by
you
in
the
language
of
your
favourite
author
pope
to
look
upon
honest
man
as
the
noblest
work
of
this
would
make
him
fly
off
and
although
he
would
admit
this
to
be
very
true
yet
he
would
not
give
his
consent
at
length
having
found
that
i
persevered
in
my
visits
to
the
young
lady
and
having
ascertained
from
my
sister
that
i
was
preparing
for
the
wedding
he
addressed
me
as
follows
one
evening
when
we
were
alone
so
i
find
from
your
sister
that
you
are
determined
in
spite
of
my
remonstrances
to
marry
miss
halcomb
it
is
very
true
that
as
you
are
of
age
i
can
not
prevent
your
union
with
that
young
lady
the
law
empowers
you
to
make
your
own
choice
but
recollect
the
law
does
not
compel
me
to
if
you
had
selected
miss
or
miss
naming
several
young
ladies
of
fortune
i
would
have
come
down
handsomely
and
you
might
have
lived
like
a
gentleman
and
if
you
had
chosen
to
be
a
farmer
you
might
have
occupied
your
own
estate
but
if
you
a
hard
bed
you
must
lie
upon
although
this
is
a
vulgar
saying
yet
it
is
a
very
just
one
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
it
applies
to
your
case
most
pointedly
i
began
to
be
impatient
and
replied
warmly
that
i
had
to
thank
god
for
a
sound
body
and
an
ardent
mind
and
i
also
had
to
thank
him
any
father
for
the
best
of
instruction
and
example
and
that
he
had
given
me
a
proof
by
his
own
industry
and
perseverance
that
a
man
might
not
only
be
happy
but
that
he
might
also
acquire
wealth
without
having
much
capital
to
begin
with
and
that
i
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
the
effects
of
lying
upon
a
by
night
so
that
i
had
peace
and
comfort
by
ah
my
dear
son
said
he
it
is
very
true
that
i
have
devoted
my
life
to
business
and
by
incessant
application
and
industry
have
acquired
a
considerable
fortune
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
added
alas
you
are
now
going
by
one
false
step
to
blast
my
fondest
hopes
by
this
match
you
are
going
in
one
hour
to
beat
down
and
destroy
all
the
bright
prospects
all
my
plans
for
promoting
your
future
and
consequence
in
life
do
you
believe
can
you
for
a
moment
be
so
silly
as
to
imagine
that
i
have
toiled
from
morning
till
night
that
i
have
laboured
with
such
incessant
assiduity
scarcely
giving
myself
time
to
enjoy
even
my
meals
and
do
you
think
that
i
have
been
so
anxious
merely
to
get
money
merely
to
acquire
riches
believe
me
my
dear
son
i
have
never
been
led
away
by
any
such
grovelling
notions
i
have
had
higher
and
more
noble
objects
in
view
in
fact
and
in
truth
my
great
my
sole
aim
has
always
been
to
make
a
man
of
in
the
county
and
although
i
know
that
riches
alone
will
neither
make
a
man
happy
nor
respected
yet
without
wealth
i
know
not
how
a
man
in
this
country
can
acquire
any
celebrity
in
it
with
wealth
if
a
man
have
but
a
common
share
of
understanding
he
is
at
once
pronounced
a
wise
man
and
he
is
looked
up
to
as
a
prodigy
when
his
own
native
talent
alone
would
not
more
than
fit
him
for
a
menial
office
look
for
instance
at
our
neighbours
there
is
astley
of
everly
who
is
surrounded
by
every
comfort
he
has
at
his
command
not
only
horses
servants
and
carriages
but
he
has
a
numerous
body
of
tenantry
who
submit
to
be
his
mere
vassals
and
will
do
any
act
however
dirty
or
mean
at
his
nod
he
is
your
commander
of
the
troop
of
yeomanry
he
keeps
hounds
and
has
many
manors
well
stocked
with
game
and
he
is
a
magistrate
of
the
county
and
ignorant
as
he
is
yet
he
dispenses
the
laws
or
rather
issues
his
arbitrary
mandates
to
the
whole
surrounding
neighbourhood
in
fact
he
possesses
great
power
and
his
power
is
derived
from
his
wealth
let
me
ask
you
who
know
him
well
what
would
he
be
without
his
wealth
strip
him
of
his
estates
and
his
riches
what
would
he
be
fit
for
i
wait
said
he
firmly
for
your
honest
reply
the
question
was
put
so
home
and
so
unexpected
and
when
i
turned
my
thoughts
towards
our
gallant
captain
without
wealth
and
power
he
presented
to
my
imagination
such
a
helpless
wretched
that
i
actually
burst
out
a
laughing
really
said
my
father
i
am
not
in
a
laughing
mood
but
tell
me
seriously
if
you
know
of
any
situation
in
life
in
which
either
on
the
score
of
his
talent
his
knowledge
or
his
ability
of
any
kind
he
would
be
capable
of
keeping
his
wife
and
family
from
starving
tell
me
honestly
whether
if
he
were
left
to
provide
for
himself
you
do
not
think
he
would
be
upon
the
parish
books
in
a
fortnight
i
answered
that
in
my
opinion
no
one
who
knew
the
captain
would
for
a
moment
dispute
the
correctness
of
the
conclusion
which
he
had
drawn
but
i
added
i
hope
sir
that
you
do
not
compare
me
to
such
a
man
as
captain
astley
and
i
hope
too
that
you
will
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
question
in
return
do
you
not
believe
sir
that
if
i
your
son
were
obliged
to
go
to
i
could
earn
sufficient
to
support
not
only
myself
but
also
a
wife
and
family
by
that
sort
of
industry
and
zealous
application
which
i
have
always
shewn
in
your
business
the
reply
was
i
know
you
are
able
and
willing
to
do
as
much
as
any
man
but
do
you
consider
that
i
have
given
you
an
education
which
cost
me
upwards
of
five
hundred
pounds
and
have
you
spent
ten
years
and
a
half
of
your
life
at
the
best
schools
under
the
best
masters
whom
i
could
procure
you
only
to
enable
you
to
earn
twenty
or
thirty
shillings
a
week
as
a
have
you
no
higher
ambition
than
that
i
rejoined
warmly
yes
sir
my
ambition
made
me
always
aspire
to
much
higher
things
and
so
did
the
treatment
which
i
always
received
from
you
heretofore
but
now
that
you
talk
of
abandoning
me
to
upon
a
hard
bed
and
intimate
that
unless
i
give
up
the
object
of
my
choice
i
am
not
to
expect
any
thing
from
you
the
scene
is
changed
and
under
such
circumstances
my
spirit
would
i
trust
never
suffer
me
to
be
dependent
upon
any
one
while
i
have
health
and
strength
to
obtain
an
honest
though
a
plain
livelihood
i
plainly
perceived
that
this
sort
of
reasoning
did
not
suit
my
father
he
reddened
and
sneeringly
exclaimed
your
spirit
indeed
i
suppose
your
spirit
will
ultimately
induce
you
to
drive
one
of
your
intended
coaches
or
perhaps
you
may
be
promoted
to
the
situation
of
and
that
will
be
a
post
considerably
above
a
this
was
said
with
a
degree
of
bitter
ironry
that
was
little
calculated
to
lead
me
into
submission
by
such
a
course
he
meant
to
work
upon
my
pride
but
his
language
produced
a
contrary
effect
to
that
which
he
intended
for
i
found
any
indignation
arise
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
sternly
answered
no
sir
whatever
you
may
think
of
my
spirit
you
will
find
that
i
inherit
too
much
of
my
father
character
either
to
degrade
myself
by
any
such
course
or
be
intimidated
by
any
false
notions
of
pride
from
doing
that
which
is
honourable
having
said
this
i
quitted
the
room
without
waiting
for
a
reply
and
retired
to
bed
much
earlier
than
usual
i
was
however
too
much
ruffled
to
go
to
sleep
and
after
having
tossed
and
turned
about
for
half
an
hour
i
suddenly
rose
dressed
myself
walked
quietly
down
stairs
and
going
into
the
back
kitchen
i
put
on
my
boots
and
then
went
deliberately
into
the
stable
where
i
saddled
my
horse
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
on
my
road
to
devizes
i
arrived
at
that
place
just
as
the
family
were
locking
up
to
go
to
rest
and
while
a
bed
was
preparing
for
me
i
explained
to
miss
the
object
of
my
visit
which
was
to
demand
her
hand
from
her
father
in
the
morning
and
to
fix
the
day
of
our
nuptials
before
i
left
the
house
the
lady
had
often
before
witnessed
with
some
degree
of
pain
the
warmth
of
my
disposition
for
i
was
as
i
have
already
hinted
of
a
sanguine
volatile
nature
and
she
had
always
observed
that
when
bent
upon
any
particular
object
i
was
never
deterred
and
seldom
persuaded
from
attempting
to
accomplish
it
but
she
had
never
before
seen
me
so
determined
and
resolved
upon
any
point
as
i
now
was
she
endeavoured
nevertheless
to
persuade
me
from
so
rash
a
step
arguing
that
she
had
little
hope
of
her
father
being
brought
over
to
comply
with
my
wishes
by
means
of
any
such
peremptory
arguments
as
i
had
used
to
her
but
it
was
all
in
vain
i
assured
her
that
before
i
left
the
house
i
would
solicit
her
father
consent
to
fix
the
day
for
our
wedding
and
that
if
he
refused
to
comply
i
should
demand
the
performance
of
her
promise
to
consent
at
once
to
our
union
without
it
she
first
reminded
me
of
her
being
under
age
and
next
with
a
degree
of
firmness
that
i
did
not
expect
she
expressed
considerable
doubts
about
acceding
to
my
demand
under
such
circumstances
i
hastily
and
as
firmly
added
that
the
day
should
be
fixed
before
i
left
the
house
she
started
at
my
vehement
and
peremptory
manner
and
with
much
good
sense
began
to
reason
with
me
and
to
shew
how
such
overbearing
proceedings
were
either
to
prevail
upon
her
father
or
what
was
of
more
consequence
to
secure
her
love
if
before
marriage
i
evinced
such
an
arbitrary
disposition
and
uttered
my
commands
in
such
a
peremptory
tone
what
security
she
said
should
she
have
for
my
not
playing
the
tyrant
afterwards
she
therefore
not
only
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
to
refuse
but
really
i
had
so
alarmed
her
that
she
could
not
give
her
consent
under
any
such
sort
of
threat
as
her
compliance
would
appear
to
come
rather
from
terror
than
inclination
this
was
followed
by
her
bursting
into
tears
occasioned
by
the
exertion
she
had
made
to
tell
me
her
resolve
i
repeated
my
protestations
and
did
every
thing
to
soothe
her
fears
and
as
she
was
now
summoned
by
her
sister
to
retire
to
rest
we
parted
for
the
night
both
of
us
in
a
very
wretched
state
of
mind
affected
as
i
was
by
her
agitated
feelings
my
composition
was
of
too
determined
a
nature
to
allow
me
to
give
way
having
once
determined
nothing
but
death
could
have
deterred
me
from
persevering
and
while
i
was
going
to
bed
i
deliberately
resolved
to
keep
my
word
nor
was
this
only
the
start
of
the
moment
on
the
contrary
i
am
quite
sure
that
had
not
the
parties
complied
with
my
wish
to
fix
the
day
before
i
left
the
house
i
should
never
have
been
the
husband
of
miss
halcomb
i
was
resolved
to
be
plain
and
honest
with
the
father
and
to
disguise
nothing
from
him
and
in
case
he
should
refuse
his
consent
i
was
equally
resolved
to
leave
nothing
untried
to
gain
the
consent
of
the
lady
if
she
withheld
it
i
had
brought
myself
much
as
i
loved
her
to
give
up
for
ever
all
hopes
all
intention
of
being
united
or
of
having
any
further
communication
with
her
with
this
determination
i
went
to
sleep
though
with
full
confidence
that
i
should
succeed
notwithstanding
the
repulse
i
had
received
from
her
before
we
parted
my
fair
readers
will
i
fear
call
me
a
conceited
puppy
for
my
pains
but
i
assure
them
it
was
not
vanity
it
was
part
of
my
nature
to
be
sanguine
and
determined
in
any
thing
in
every
thing
that
i
undertook
for
i
believed
that
success
seldom
completely
crowned
an
enterprise
unless
he
who
wished
to
obtain
it
had
confidence
that
he
should
succeed
when
i
came
to
the
breakfast
table
in
the
morning
i
could
perceive
that
the
fair
object
of
my
hopes
had
not
enjoyed
so
much
repose
as
i
had
done
daring
the
night
her
heart
appeared
to
be
ill
at
ease
i
had
never
slept
better
or
sounder
in
my
life
this
is
another
extraordinary
part
of
my
composition
or
rather
of
my
constitution
namely
the
physical
operation
of
the
mental
power
over
the
animal
frame
the
more
intense
the
operation
of
my
mind
during
the
day
the
better
do
i
sleep
at
night
the
greater
the
object
which
i
have
to
accomplish
in
the
morning
the
more
serene
is
my
sleep
so
that
when
i
have
any
weighty
business
to
perform
that
requires
the
exertion
of
my
whole
mental
as
well
as
bodily
powers
instead
of
being
agitated
with
the
anxiety
arising
from
the
importance
of
the
undertaking
i
am
quite
the
reverse
i
am
perfectly
tranquil
i
am
sure
to
sleep
well
and
to
awake
so
much
refreshed
in
the
morning
as
to
enable
me
to
commence
the
business
of
the
day
not
only
with
vigour
but
also
with
my
senses
quite
collected
and
with
the
greatest
calmness
of
mind
i
appeared
upon
this
occasion
so
easy
and
so
quiet
yet
altogether
so
determined
that
i
often
afterwards
heard
my
wife
say
that
she
for
the
first
time
began
to
suspect
the
sincerity
of
my
passion
its
ardour
she
never
doubted
the
fact
was
that
if
i
had
harboured
all
the
doubts
that
she
did
as
to
the
success
of
my
application
to
her
father
i
might
have
felt
as
uneasy
as
she
did
and
should
have
been
thereby
rendered
incapable
of
successfully
combating
his
arguments
or
objections
the
moment
the
breakfast
was
over
i
requested
a
private
conference
with
him
when
i
honestly
told
him
every
thing
that
had
passed
between
my
father
and
me
and
that
i
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
gaining
his
consent
adding
that
i
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
laying
the
case
fairly
before
him
but
that
i
was
determined
to
have
his
answer
at
once
whether
he
would
consent
to
our
union
so
that
a
day
might
be
fixed
or
whether
he
would
leave
me
to
do
my
best
to
obtain
his
daughter
consent
which
i
was
resolved
to
do
in
case
of
his
opposing
my
wishes
seeing
my
determination
the
old
gentleman
answered
that
although
he
lamented
the
absence
of
my
father
sanction
yet
he
would
keep
his
word
with
me
and
his
daughter
and
would
not
withhold
his
consent
if
it
were
her
desire
that
he
should
give
it
he
valued
the
happiness
of
his
child
he
said
and
as
he
thought
i
had
always
acted
a
fair
and
open
part
with
him
he
would
do
the
same
by
me
he
would
however
leave
it
entirely
to
his
daughter
if
she
chose
to
fix
the
day
he
would
not
object
to
it
and
if
it
were
so
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
render
us
happy
he
likewise
expressed
a
sincere
hope
that
his
old
friend
my
father
would
do
nothing
to
make
us
otherwise
and
that
he
would
become
reconciled
to
the
match
hereafter
even
if
he
would
not
give
his
consent
before
halcomb
then
for
the
first
time
hinted
what
sum
he
intended
to
give
his
daughter
as
a
portion
i
told
him
that
for
the
present
i
would
hear
nothing
of
the
sort
that
as
my
father
would
not
enable
me
to
make
a
settlement
upon
his
daughter
i
would
trust
entirely
to
him
and
that
i
never
wished
him
to
mention
the
subject
to
me
till
we
were
married
i
now
flew
to
the
young
lady
with
the
joyful
tidings
and
was
received
as
i
expected
with
open
arms
and
before
ten
that
evening
the
day
was
fixed
for
our
wedding
about
six
weeks
from
that
time
thus
was
i
at
the
age
of
and
very
young
and
inexperienced
of
my
age
also
about
to
take
a
wife
against
the
consent
of
my
father
without
a
house
a
home
or
twenty
pounds
in
the
world
and
perfectly
careless
whether
her
father
gave
its
five
or
five
hundred
pounds
to
have
a
wife
was
my
determination
and
now
the
day
was
fixed
i
returned
to
my
house
and
entered
into
his
business
again
with
all
my
usual
zeal
and
assiduity
the
first
opportunity
i
informed
him
of
the
arrangement
that
was
made
upon
hearing
which
he
flew
into
a
violent
passion
and
vowed
vengeance
nor
did
he
fail
to
try
the
last
effort
which
was
to
endeavour
to
make
halcomb
pride
operate
so
as
to
prevent
the
match
the
next
market
day
he
had
a
private
interview
with
him
and
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
accomplish
his
object
his
opponent
had
the
best
of
the
argument
but
he
retorted
his
insinuations
with
such
a
degree
of
spirit
that
for
a
while
my
father
had
hopes
of
success
halcomb
however
soon
crushed
his
hopes
by
telling
him
that
he
had
given
me
and
his
daughter
his
word
and
that
nothing
which
he
had
said
in
his
anger
should
induce
him
to
break
it
my
father
when
requested
to
see
the
young
lady
which
was
readily
assented
to
in
the
course
of
his
interview
with
her
he
made
every
effort
to
persuade
her
to
abandon
such
a
as
he
was
pleased
to
term
it
and
she
listened
to
and
answered
all
his
arguments
with
great
modesty
and
forbearance
he
urged
the
folly
of
such
a
match
and
told
her
he
was
sure
she
would
live
to
repent
it
he
warned
her
that
such
sudden
and
inconsiderate
unions
seldom
if
ever
turned
out
well
he
pointed
out
to
her
my
hasty
enthusiastic
volatile
disposition
he
said
that
i
had
seen
nothing
of
the
world
and
that
whatever
might
be
her
charms
when
i
got
into
the
world
i
might
see
other
objects
that
might
induce
me
to
repent
of
having
been
so
hasty
he
mentioned
the
probability
of
a
large
family
of
children
without
the
means
of
supporting
them
in
fact
he
tried
every
thing
that
man
could
do
he
begged
he
prayed
and
he
threatened
all
was
in
vain
the
only
promise
that
he
could
obtain
from
her
was
that
she
would
inform
me
of
all
he
said
and
that
she
would
leave
the
decision
to
me
this
to
him
was
worse
than
no
promise
at
all
and
he
retired
to
the
market
room
and
took
his
dinner
perfectly
dissatisfied
with
the
little
or
gather
no
progress
which
he
had
made
however
when
the
evening
came
instead
of
calling
for
his
horse
to
go
home
as
usual
he
sent
for
halcomb
and
told
him
that
as
it
was
a
dark
evening
and
he
was
not
very
well
if
he
would
permit
him
he
would
drink
tea
and
spend
the
evening
with
his
family
and
take
a
bed
there
that
night
halcomb
who
was
a
generous
forgiving
fellow
readily
pardoned
all
the
insulting
language
that
he
had
heard
in
the
morning
accepted
his
offer
by
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
and
without
further
ceremony
introduced
him
into
his
private
room
to
his
family
halcomb
however
the
of
the
lady
having
learned
what
had
passed
in
the
morning
and
expecting
nothing
less
than
a
fresh
attempt
to
frustrate
the
match
no
sooner
fixed
her
piercing
eyes
upon
him
after
he
was
seated
than
she
drew
up
and
without
waiting
for
any
explanation
began
to
resent
the
insult
which
he
had
offered
to
her
profession
he
however
demanded
a
parley
and
a
truce
to
all
hostility
as
he
was
come
to
offer
the
olive
branch
assuring
her
that
as
a
match
could
not
be
avoided
he
was
determined
to
make
the
best
of
what
must
be
endured
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
had
a
private
interview
with
the
young
lady
and
after
extorting
a
solemn
pledge
from
her
that
she
would
not
inform
me
of
it
till
we
were
married
he
gave
her
his
consent
and
promised
to
acknowledge
her
as
his
this
solemn
pledge
to
keep
silence
till
our
union
was
completed
he
made
her
give
because
he
wished
to
see
how
far
i
would
go
without
his
consent
and
she
kept
her
word
although
the
fact
certainly
came
to
my
knowledge
through
a
third
person
my
father
took
the
first
opportunity
of
telling
me
that
as
i
was
determined
to
marry
against
his
will
he
should
do
but
little
for
me
compared
to
what
he
would
have
done
if
i
had
married
to
please
him
he
would
he
said
give
me
or
rather
he
would
lend
me
the
stock
upon
widdington
farm
and
i
might
begin
to
furnish
my
house
as
soon
as
i
pleased
but
i
must
do
this
out
of
the
fortune
which
i
was
to
have
with
my
wife
there
was
a
most
excellent
stock
upon
this
farm
the
rent
of
which
was
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
there
were
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
of
the
finest
southdown
sheep
the
very
best
in
the
county
as
this
was
a
fine
sheep
farm
in
fact
principally
so
twelve
cows
six
most
valuable
cart
horses
and
all
other
live
and
dead
stock
complete
with
this
arrangement
i
was
perfectly
content
and
indeed
it
was
much
better
than
i
had
any
reason
to
expect
the
farm
was
in
reality
a
very
beautiful
one
with
a
very
good
house
and
all
necessary
appendages
attached
to
it
i
now
seemed
to
be
in
a
fair
way
of
obtaining
the
height
of
my
ambition
this
happy
intelligence
i
lost
no
time
in
communicating
to
the
family
at
devizes
and
the
necessary
orders
were
given
without
delay
i
left
it
all
to
the
lady
as
it
was
to
be
paid
for
out
of
her
fortune
few
young
men
entered
into
life
with
fairer
prospects
in
the
farming
line
very
few
farmers
in
the
county
had
such
a
stock
of
all
sorts
in
truth
nothing
was
wanting
the
happy
day
at
length
arrived
it
was
the
twelfth
of
january
my
sister
who
was
to
be
one
of
the
and
my
friend
the
clergyman
of
enford
who
was
to
marry
us
went
over
with
me
in
a
chaise
upon
retiring
to
rest
having
undressed
myself
i
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
meditating
upon
the
serious
engagement
into
which
i
was
to
enter
on
the
morrow
in
this
situation
i
fell
fast
asleep
and
did
not
awake
till
three
in
the
morning
when
i
had
caught
a
dreadful
cold
and
was
in
a
shivering
fit
which
i
could
not
get
rid
of
till
i
arose
in
the
morning
i
was
excessively
ill
the
whole
of
the
day
we
were
taken
to
the
church
in
a
post
coach
and
being
married
we
returned
to
breakfast
where
a
large
party
was
assembled
to
greet
us
we
were
engaged
to
dine
at
the
castle
at
marlborough
which
inn
was
kept
by
my
wife
brother
we
the
married
couple
in
a
chaise
and
two
post
coaches
each
with
four
beautiful
grey
horses
with
the
rest
of
the
party
accordingly
set
out
to
marlborough
where
we
spent
the
day
during
the
whole
of
which
i
suffered
great
pain
being
all
the
time
extremely
we
returned
to
devizes
to
tea
after
taking
which
we
were
to
go
home
to
widdington
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
halcombe
took
me
aside
with
his
son
into
the
next
room
and
holding
out
a
canvass
bag
he
said
here
my
son
is
all
that
i
can
afford
to
give
you
with
my
daughter
in
this
bag
is
a
thousand
pounds
i
wish
it
were
ten
times
as
much
but
such
as
it
is
may
god
grant
you
to
enjoy
it
i
have
no
doubt
but
it
will
wear
well
as
it
was
got
honestly
this
again
was
more
than
i
expected
as
the
only
time
i
had
ever
permitted
him
to
speak
about
money
the
old
gentlemen
hinted
at
no
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
but
i
believe
my
father
had
said
something
which
made
him
double
the
sum
i
thanked
him
most
heartily
not
forgetting
to
add
that
his
daughter
was
the
prize
at
which
i
had
aimed
and
not
the
money
he
replied
that
he
should
give
his
other
daughter
the
same
without
trenching
upon
what
he
meant
to
give
his
sons
in
fact
he
had
at
this
time
provided
for
them
however
before
we
parted
one
of
his
sons
william
who
was
then
the
manager
of
the
bear
called
me
on
one
side
and
said
that
as
his
brother
james
was
just
going
into
business
if
i
had
no
particular
use
for
the
money
he
should
be
obliged
if
i
would
lend
him
of
it
upon
their
joint
notes
i
instantly
complied
told
out
half
my
wife
portion
and
lent
it
to
her
brother
upon
his
word
to
give
me
a
note
for
it
which
he
did
the
first
time
that
i
saw
him
afterwards
i
believe
if
they
had
asked
me
for
the
whole
thousand
i
should
cheerfully
have
parted
with
it
to
them
the
five
hundred
pounds
remained
in
their
hands
for
nearly
ten
years
and
was
not
withdrawn
by
me
till
several
years
after
my
separation
from
my
wife
i
mention
this
circumstance
merely
to
shew
how
these
gentlemen
felt
as
to
my
separation
from
their
sister
in
fact
they
as
well
as
myself
considered
it
to
be
a
misfortune
which
ought
to
be
lamented
on
all
sides
rather
than
as
a
reason
for
entertaining
any
vindictive
feeling
towards
me
we
now
set
off
in
a
coach
towards
our
future
residence
widdington
farm
a
distance
of
ten
miles
the
company
consisted
of
myself
the
bride
her
sister
and
mine
who
were
the
two
bride
maids
and
the
clergyman
i
had
by
this
time
completely
recovered
from
the
effect
of
my
cold
but
what
was
rather
remarkable
before
we
had
accomplished
half
our
journey
we
discovered
that
the
bride
had
suddenly
lost
her
voice
without
feeling
any
pain
or
illness
so
completely
had
she
lost
it
that
she
could
not
articulate
a
single
syllable
otherwise
than
in
a
whisper
i
was
very
much
alarmed
at
first
but
as
she
assured
us
it
was
only
a
cold
and
that
she
felt
not
the
least
pain
or
uneasiness
whatever
and
as
with
perfect
good
humour
she
congratulated
me
on
being
about
to
take
to
my
home
a
quiet
wife
the
alarm
gradually
passed
off
widdington
farm
lies
about
a
mile
from
the
turnpike
road
and
when
the
carriage
turned
out
of
the
high
road
i
was
obliged
as
it
was
dark
to
get
on
the
coach
box
to
direct
the
post
boys
and
after
considerable
difficulty
we
reached
the
house
it
being
a
road
over
which
a
chaise
probably
had
not
passed
since
my
father
left
the
farm
twenty
years
before
this
period
although
every
thing
was
prepared
comfortably
for
our
reception
yet
a
lone
farm
in
a
valley
upon
the
downs
which
compose
salisbury
plain
and
not
a
house
within
a
mile
was
quite
a
different
thing
from
the
cheerful
scenes
to
which
hunt
and
her
sister
had
been
accustomed
a
deep
silence
reigned
around
not
a
tree
nor
even
a
bush
was
to
be
seen
and
since
we
left
the
turnpike
road
the
carriage
having
passed
over
the
turf
for
nearly
the
last
mile
the
sound
of
wheels
rattling
over
the
stones
had
never
once
vibrated
upon
the
ears
of
those
who
were
so
much
accustomed
to
it
altogether
it
was
so
very
different
from
every
thing
to
which
the
ladies
had
ever
before
been
habituated
that
even
after
i
had
introduced
them
into
the
parlour
which
was
well
lighted
up
and
where
the
hospitable
board
seemed
almost
to
invite
their
welcome
yet
i
could
see
that
miss
halcombe
looked
at
her
sister
almost
in
a
state
of
despondency
as
much
as
to
say
god
of
heaven
what
enchanted
castle
are
we
come
to
at
last
however
when
we
were
once
seated
round
the
table
with
the
door
closed
the
solitary
gloom
speedily
vanished
for
we
soon
made
it
appear
that
there
was
as
much
cheerfullness
to
be
obtained
in
a
lone
farm
house
as
there
was
in
one
of
the
most
public
and
best
frequented
inns
upon
the
bath
road
miss
halcombe
as
a
matter
of
delicacy
had
always
declined
to
see
this
residence
before
she
was
married
notwithstanding
i
had
repeatedly
pressed
her
to
ride
over
and
give
orders
about
the
arrangement
of
the
house
and
other
domestic
affairs
during
the
first
fortnight
that
we
were
married
my
wife
never
spoke
one
word
louder
than
a
whisper
at
the
end
of
that
time
her
voice
returned
to
the
great
joy
of
myself
and
all
her
friends
the
honeymoon
passed
with
uninterrupted
felicity
in
fact
it
was
a
honeymoon
all
the
year
round
and
we
were
blessed
with
an
endearing
pledge
of
our
loves
before
the
honeymoon
appeared
even
in
its
wane
nearly
a
year
had
now
gone
by
in
one
unbroken
scene
of
pleasure
and
gay
delight
my
wife
was
of
a
cheerful
disposition
and
fond
of
company
in
which
i
most
cordially
participated
and
consequently
we
were
seldom
without
plenty
of
visitors
as
soon
as
we
were
married
i
purchased
two
more
horses
and
a
gig
thus
my
establishment
at
once
consisted
of
three
horses
and
a
gig
and
when
to
these
are
added
and
pointers
the
reader
will
perceive
that
i
cut
a
dashing
figure
whether
at
home
at
the
table
in
the
field
or
on
the
road
i
drove
two
mares
in
a
tandem
with
which
i
could
and
did
accomplish
in
a
trot
fourteen
miles
within
the
hour
i
was
almost
always
the
first
in
the
chase
having
become
a
subscriber
to
a
pack
of
hounds
and
my
pointers
were
as
well
bred
and
as
well
broken
as
any
sportsman
in
the
county
i
was
now
become
that
of
which
my
father
had
always
entertained
the
greatest
dread
namely
a
complete
sportsman
frequently
when
he
called
i
was
from
home
either
hunting
shooting
or
partaking
of
the
social
society
which
is
the
concomitant
of
those
who
delight
in
the
sports
of
the
field
he
would
ride
round
my
farm
but
there
all
was
in
the
most
regular
order
and
he
could
find
no
other
fault
with
any
thing
he
saw
going
on
there
than
the
absence
of
the
master
yet
he
was
uneasy
for
he
well
knew
that
the
profits
of
widdington
farm
would
not
support
such
extravagance
and
revelry
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
it
the
stock
it
is
true
was
in
good
order
and
the
crops
were
well
cultivated
and
thriving
never
better
still
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
expense
attending
a
house
always
thronged
with
visitors
a
stable
and
kennel
full
of
horses
and
dogs
and
the
master
entering
with
ardour
into
the
sports
of
the
field
he
remonstrated
but
i
was
young
thoughtless
and
giddy
my
wife
was
the
same
came
three
hundred
pounds
was
due
to
wyndham
for
rent
my
father
knew
i
was
not
prepared
he
was
certain
from
the
manner
in
which
i
had
lived
that
i
could
not
have
saved
any
money
without
saying
one
word
to
me
on
the
subject
he
paid
the
rent
himself
but
he
did
not
fail
again
to
urge
the
strongest
remonstrances
no
farm
in
the
county
was
in
better
condition
or
better
looked
after
the
times
were
good
and
if
the
farm
had
been
my
own
i
could
just
have
managed
to
live
in
a
very
respectable
way
for
no
man
knew
better
how
to
make
the
most
of
every
thing
and
very
few
put
it
into
practice
more
rigidly
than
i
did
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
could
very
well
manage
to
spend
all
the
gains
whatever
they
were
and
as
my
father
paid
the
rent
as
well
as
stocked
the
farm
it
was
quite
as
good
as
if
it
were
my
own
my
father
however
threatened
me
and
remonstrated
with
my
wife
on
our
keeping
so
much
company
and
being
guilty
of
such
extravagance
but
she
could
not
be
induced
to
think
that
we
did
any
thing
in
a
more
extravagant
way
than
we
were
bred
up
to
which
was
very
true
and
as
i
was
full
as
prone
to
the
enjoyment
of
society
as
she
was
we
seldom
refused
an
invitation
and
never
failed
to
return
it
christmas
arrived
and
with
it
of
course
the
social
that
at
this
time
was
kept
up
with
the
greatest
spirit
in
this
part
of
the
country
where
every
one
gave
a
christmas
feast
which
was
attended
by
all
the
neighbours
for
several
miles
round
we
were
invited
to
the
first
some
difficulty
presented
itself
with
respect
to
hunt
accepting
the
invitation
as
our
daughter
was
only
two
months
old
but
this
impediment
was
soon
removed
the
little
child
was
in
excellent
health
and
the
nurse
it
was
thought
would
take
great
care
of
it
in
the
mother
absence
this
was
settled
as
much
to
my
satisfaction
as
to
that
of
my
wife
for
i
enjoyed
little
pleasure
unless
she
was
with
me
to
partake
of
it
when
the
day
came
we
mounted
our
horses
and
she
being
an
excellent
horsewoman
we
galloped
off
to
meet
our
friends
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
and
we
reached
the
place
without
the
slightest
accident
though
it
was
one
of
the
most
severe
frosts
i
was
ever
out
in
about
three
the
next
morning
we
returned
in
the
same
way
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
my
father
when
he
saw
her
come
into
the
room
and
involuntarily
exclaimed
for
god
sake
hunt
where
is
your
child
she
answered
it
was
at
home
he
turned
his
eyes
up
and
said
no
more
but
i
felt
this
as
a
most
severe
rebuke
and
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
think
that
a
mother
leaving
her
child
was
not
quite
so
proper
he
soon
took
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
me
aside
and
having
asked
me
whether
i
was
mad
to
bring
my
wife
away
from
a
young
sucking
child
in
such
weather
he
added
you
acted
very
prudently
and
firmly
i
understand
when
your
child
was
born
as
to
her
suckling
it
but
now
you
are
going
to
destroy
the
child
by
suffering
the
mother
to
remain
from
it
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
at
a
time
i
listened
indeed
to
this
wholesome
advice
but
in
the
thoughtlessness
of
my
heart
unfortunately
i
passed
it
of
without
paying
it
that
attention
to
which
coming
from
one
with
such
experience
as
my
father
had
it
was
so
well
entitled
what
my
father
alluded
to
about
my
firm
conduct
when
my
child
was
born
was
this
my
mother
having
always
nursed
her
own
children
i
was
bred
up
with
the
notion
that
it
ought
to
be
so
and
i
still
entertained
the
greatest
antipathy
to
my
offspring
sucking
any
other
woman
but
its
mother
my
father
had
on
his
side
already
guarded
me
against
all
the
arts
and
tricks
played
off
by
gossips
upon
such
an
occasion
upon
this
subject
therefore
i
had
always
expressed
a
strong
and
decided
feeling
to
my
wife
in
which
she
appeared
to
participate
when
the
child
was
born
the
mother
was
attended
by
the
and
two
or
three
matrons
besides
the
midwife
they
all
knew
my
determination
about
the
mother
nursing
the
child
and
every
attempt
was
apparently
made
to
carry
it
into
effect
at
length
a
hint
was
given
of
some
fears
as
to
its
practicability
i
would
not
listen
to
it
for
a
moment
another
hint
was
given
and
then
a
broader
and
a
broader
hint
but
i
still
made
light
of
it
and
said
we
would
persevere
on
consulting
with
my
wife
i
found
there
was
no
natural
impediment
and
that
she
was
well
disposed
to
exert
herself
to
comply
with
my
wishes
but
i
found
that
the
gossips
and
particularly
the
had
been
labouring
to
impress
on
her
mind
not
only
that
there
was
a
difficulty
but
that
there
was
an
inconvenience
and
even
impropriety
i
was
not
to
be
deterred
from
my
purpose
and
did
every
thing
in
my
power
to
persuade
her
to
persevere
i
saw
that
the
child
enjoyed
the
breast
very
much
and
that
it
did
not
give
the
mother
so
much
pain
as
i
had
apprehended
and
my
mind
was
therefore
more
resolved
than
ever
to
carry
this
point
although
i
had
never
before
had
to
contend
with
such
powerful
antagonists
as
the
gossips
who
affected
to
treat
my
knowledge
upon
such
matters
with
ridicule
and
my
interference
in
them
as
preposterous
and
indecent
i
ways
however
i
heard
all
they
had
to
say
but
i
stuck
to
my
point
like
a
hero
and
i
took
care
not
to
leave
the
house
long
at
a
time
for
fear
some
scheme
to
thwart
my
views
should
be
put
in
execution
at
the
end
of
two
days
in
the
evening
after
supper
the
grand
attack
was
made
by
three
matrons
and
the
nurse
with
the
or
whom
they
appeared
to
have
enlisted
into
the
service
though
as
he
was
a
reasonable
intelligent
man
i
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
his
hostility
and
particularly
as
i
had
previously
consulted
him
upon
the
subject
and
found
that
i
was
perfectly
correct
as
to
there
being
no
natural
impediment
in
the
mother
while
the
was
taking
his
grog
with
me
they
all
according
to
their
previously
settled
scheme
came
down
stairs
in
a
body
and
all
burst
upon
me
at
once
loudly
declaring
that
they
would
not
force
the
poor
weak
mother
any
longer
to
destroy
herself
by
such
a
course
that
the
child
must
certainly
die
that
it
was
starved
already
and
that
unless
i
would
suffer
them
to
send
for
a
wet
nurse
in
the
morning
they
would
leave
the
house
and
i
might
stay
and
kill
the
child
myself
for
that
they
would
not
remain
to
be
witnesses
of
the
murder
i
saw
through
the
premeditated
assault
and
was
immoveably
silent
one
said
that
it
was
cruel
another
said
that
it
was
indecent
a
third
that
it
was
and
a
fourth
that
i
did
not
deserve
such
a
wife
or
such
a
child
for
i
wished
to
kill
the
one
and
break
the
heart
of
the
other
had
i
not
been
cautioned
by
my
excellent
father
who
even
to
the
very
letter
of
this
attack
had
told
me
what
was
likely
to
happen
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
withstand
the
battery
of
their
tongues
the
doctor
meanwhile
said
not
a
word
unless
it
was
in
reply
to
a
question
put
by
some
one
of
the
ladies
and
then
he
took
care
to
answer
in
a
very
equivocal
manner
for
he
saw
my
usual
determination
settled
upon
my
brow
i
told
them
at
last
that
if
they
would
remain
below
i
would
go
up
and
consult
my
wife
i
found
her
bathed
in
tears
for
they
had
not
only
prepared
her
for
the
occasion
but
they
had
actually
worked
upon
her
fears
for
the
safety
of
the
child
so
far
as
to
persuade
her
that
the
child
would
be
starved
and
that
she
had
not
milk
enough
to
keep
it
alive
i
soothed
her
i
reasoned
with
her
for
i
dearly
loved
her
i
assured
her
that
the
child
was
in
the
most
perfect
health
as
was
evident
from
its
having
never
cried
a
minute
since
it
was
born
which
was
now
nearly
three
days
that
it
was
contented
and
i
was
sure
it
would
do
well
and
that
she
herself
would
ultimately
thank
me
for
persevering
against
the
will
of
the
gossips
her
tears
were
soon
dried
up
and
the
pretty
babe
being
again
placed
by
her
side
with
my
own
hands
she
was
quite
convinced
that
it
was
neither
necessary
nor
prudent
to
give
way
always
even
to
gossips
having
left
the
child
comfortably
asleep
and
the
mother
happy
her
fears
being
now
dissipated
i
returned
down
stairs
to
the
enraged
matrons
i
found
them
all
on
the
of
expectation
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
i
told
them
that
i
had
no
doubt
but
the
mother
and
child
would
do
very
well
if
they
would
leave
her
alone
but
this
enraged
them
more
than
ever
they
insisted
that
the
mother
should
at
least
have
the
help
of
a
well
said
i
very
calmly
but
very
determinedly
if
it
most
be
so
it
must
if
you
are
of
the
same
mind
and
the
doctor
confirms
your
opinion
that
the
child
requires
more
milk
i
will
kill
the
puppies
and
it
shall
suck
my
beautiful
setter
with
all
my
heart
but
by
g
d
it
shall
never
taste
the
milk
of
another
woman
while
its
mother
is
alive
and
as
well
able
to
nurse
it
as
she
now
is
i
said
this
in
such
a
tone
and
with
such
a
manner
as
would
not
admit
of
any
further
reply
and
the
gossips
all
marched
off
to
bed
abusing
me
for
a
great
brute
but
as
they
afterwards
told
me
applauding
me
for
displaying
so
much
resolution
in
spite
of
their
cabal
and
plot
against
me
being
frustrated
when
they
were
gone
the
doctor
robert
clare
of
devizes
most
heartily
congratulated
me
upon
my
success
adding
that
he
never
saw
such
a
complete
victory
gained
against
such
fearful
odds
since
he
had
been
in
the
practice
which
was
upwards
of
twenty
years
i
have
related
this
circumstance
as
a
matter
of
duty
for
the
information
and
guidance
of
all
young
persons
who
may
he
placed
in
a
similar
situation
and
who
may
not
have
had
the
advantage
of
such
good
and
able
advice
as
that
which
was
given
me
by
my
excellent
father
rather
than
as
boasting
of
any
merit
of
my
own
never
was
a
child
born
that
was
nursed
better
and
thousands
of
blessings
did
the
mother
afterwards
bestow
upon
me
for
my
perseverance
by
which
she
was
enabled
to
enjoy
the
most
delightful
of
all
sensations
that
of
nursing
her
own
offspring
let
us
now
return
to
my
story
the
very
first
time
that
this
child
ever
had
a
moment
illness
was
the
day
after
my
wife
returned
from
the
first
christmas
party
this
illness
was
very
severe
and
it
caused
great
restlessness
the
infant
was
indeed
so
unwell
that
hunt
sent
an
excuse
to
the
party
the
next
day
by
me
she
being
determined
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
her
child
in
which
resolution
i
concurred
still
i
had
no
idea
that
the
dear
little
thing
would
not
do
very
well
again
though
i
was
now
convinced
of
the
propriety
of
my
father
rebuke
and
had
not
the
least
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
the
illness
was
occasioned
by
the
mother
long
absence
from
her
child
i
went
to
the
dinner
and
my
father
was
the
first
to
applaud
hunt
prudence
in
remaining
at
home
although
when
he
heard
of
the
illness
of
the
child
he
observed
the
experience
that
is
bought
is
the
best
so
that
it
is
not
purchased
too
dear
about
eleven
at
night
a
message
was
brought
me
by
a
servant
to
say
that
my
child
was
very
ill
and
to
beg
that
i
would
immediately
return
home
i
mounted
my
horse
and
reached
my
house
half
as
hour
before
the
servant
who
was
upon
another
horse
when
i
entered
the
room
oh
god
the
child
was
lying
dead
in
its
mother
lap
and
that
mother
was
sitting
speechless
with
her
eyes
riveted
upon
her
lifeless
i
instantly
caused
the
little
delicate
corpse
to
be
removed
it
had
a
smile
upon
its
lip
and
looked
as
transparent
as
alabaster
for
it
had
died
without
a
groan
or
a
struggle
my
wife
sat
petrified
she
had
never
moved
nor
spoken
since
the
infant
had
breathed
its
last
which
was
nearly
an
hour
the
servants
were
fearful
even
to
touch
her
or
the
child
she
still
sat
motionless
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
lap
the
spot
whence
her
child
had
been
removed
and
where
she
had
seen
it
breathe
its
last
she
took
not
the
least
notice
of
me
neither
did
she
oppose
the
removal
of
the
child
her
look
was
vacant
and
i
tried
in
vain
every
means
to
rouse
her
at
length
i
carried
her
to
her
room
and
having
bathed
her
feet
in
warm
water
i
was
ultimately
blessed
by
witnessing
the
return
of
her
reason
which
was
accompanied
by
a
copious
flow
of
tears
during
the
round
of
gaiety
and
pleasure
which
i
had
enjoyed
since
i
was
married
this
was
the
first
check
that
i
had
received
but
young
thoughtless
and
giddy
as
we
were
it
was
a
most
severe
one
both
to
myself
and
my
wife
nor
was
it
merely
the
loss
of
our
offspring
that
occasioned
the
sorrow
of
my
wife
her
grief
was
rendered
infinitely
more
poignant
by
the
circumstance
of
the
deceased
infant
never
having
been
baptised
the
babe
had
in
fact
been
so
healthy
so
perfectly
free
from
the
slightest
appearance
of
disease
that
we
had
never
thought
of
sending
for
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
particularly
as
we
intended
to
have
it
christened
so
soon
as
the
nineteenth
of
january
which
was
the
first
anniversary
of
our
wedding
day
the
delay
will
i
am
sure
be
thought
the
more
excusable
even
by
the
most
scrupulously
religious
persons
when
i
inform
them
that
the
clergyman
lived
at
milton
a
distance
of
eight
miles
that
he
seldom
came
into
the
parish
except
on
a
sunday
and
that
even
then
his
visit
was
generally
a
flying
visit
as
he
had
two
or
three
churches
to
serve
on
that
day
he
was
besides
an
excellent
sportsman
and
consequently
it
would
have
been
considered
by
at
any
rate
if
not
by
as
a
sort
of
crime
to
have
broken
in
upon
a
for
any
such
purpose
but
i
now
sincerely
repented
of
my
folly
and
thoughtlessness
for
my
wife
was
inconsolable
she
was
bred
up
strictly
to
attend
to
all
the
forms
as
well
as
the
duties
of
religion
and
she
therefore
accused
herself
of
a
heinous
crime
even
that
of
having
sacrificed
the
soul
of
her
infant
and
then
the
very
thoughts
of
having
the
little
corpse
committed
to
its
dreary
dwelling
without
the
rites
and
ceremony
of
a
christian
burial
was
so
dreadful
to
her
that
it
almost
made
her
frantic
and
she
would
sometimes
break
out
into
the
most
piteous
wailings
nearly
bordering
upon
desperation
i
was
myself
most
wretched
not
so
much
from
the
loss
of
our
child
as
from
the
sorrow
and
anguish
of
my
wife
whom
i
most
dearly
loved
but
i
found
it
necessary
to
stifle
my
own
feelings
and
exert
all
my
soothing
aid
and
persuasive
powers
to
calm
her
agonized
mind
at
first
i
was
but
a
poor
comforter
had
never
thought
at
all
of
these
weighty
and
therefore
i
felt
myself
very
incompetent
to
reason
upon
them
in
such
a
way
as
was
likely
to
convince
and
console
her
i
had
been
taught
by
my
excellent
mother
to
lisp
the
lord
prayer
the
belief
and
the
catechism
before
i
at
all
knew
the
meaning
of
it
and
almost
before
i
could
speak
plainly
i
had
been
bred
up
in
the
christian
faith
a
strict
and
such
was
the
force
of
custom
that
perhaps
i
had
not
ten
times
in
the
course
of
my
life
closed
my
eyes
after
retiring
to
rest
without
repeating
the
lords
prayer
and
belief
though
it
is
probable
that
during
all
that
period
i
had
not
ten
times
seriously
directed
my
thoughts
to
investigating
and
reasoning
upon
the
true
import
and
meaning
of
these
prayers
such
is
the
strength
of
early
habits
and
early
imbibed
notions
arising
from
the
repetition
of
a
certain
number
of
words
and
sentences
thrown
together
and
imprinted
upon
the
young
memory
before
the
mind
is
capable
of
appreciating
the
meaning
or
sense
of
them
i
had
also
soon
after
our
marriage
received
the
sacrament
with
my
wife
because
i
was
told
that
to
go
through
this
ceremony
was
proper
and
necessary
i
did
this
as
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
had
i
believe
done
before
me
from
a
conviction
that
it
was
right
without
ever
having
reasoned
upon
the
matter
and
now
for
the
first
time
at
the
age
of
twenty
three
in
spite
of
myself
or
rather
in
my
own
defence
i
was
compelled
to
think
and
to
reason
also
that
i
might
bring
comfort
to
my
almost
wife
i
reasoned
thus
can
this
be
possible
that
a
little
innocent
creature
only
two
months
old
totally
incapable
of
having
committed
any
offence
against
god
or
man
having
indeed
been
incapable
of
acting
or
thinking
at
all
can
the
creator
have
doomed
such
an
unoffending
being
to
eternal
punishment
because
its
parents
have
neglected
to
have
certain
forms
of
prayer
read
by
a
clergyman
and
because
it
has
not
had
performed
over
it
the
ceremony
of
sprinkling
its
forehead
with
water
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
question
farther
for
i
at
once
pronounced
it
to
be
not
only
preposterous
but
impious
to
believe
such
a
thing
for
a
moment
having
thus
satisfied
my
own
mind
i
now
set
about
the
task
of
convincing
my
wife
i
found
her
hanging
over
the
corpse
of
our
child
and
bathing
it
with
her
tears
the
first
thing
which
i
did
was
to
lead
her
from
the
endearing
object
of
her
inexpressible
woe
i
then
not
only
used
the
foregoing
argument
but
many
others
of
the
same
reasonable
and
natural
tendency
she
was
however
not
easily
to
be
brought
over
to
my
opinion
and
besides
in
spite
of
all
i
could
say
to
remove
the
impression
she
blamed
herself
for
having
left
the
infant
at
such
a
tender
age
i
also
felt
that
in
this
respect
i
was
not
less
censurable
than
she
was
and
i
endeavoured
to
take
all
this
blame
upon
myself
by
persuading
her
that
she
would
not
have
gone
had
she
not
been
desirous
of
obliging
in
striving
to
tranquillize
her
i
had
a
most
arduous
duty
to
perform
yet
painful
as
it
was
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
most
delightful
occupation
that
can
be
imagined
to
console
to
comfort
to
cheer
the
drooping
spirits
to
heal
the
wounded
sorrowing
heart
to
remove
the
dark
and
gloomy
doubts
and
at
length
to
inspire
and
provoke
a
smile
upon
the
quivering
lip
of
her
i
fondly
loved
was
to
me
an
entirely
new
scene
i
could
now
fully
comprehend
the
poetical
expression
of
the
joy
of
grief
for
this
was
the
most
extatic
joy
it
was
a
hitherto
untasted
pleasure
and
although
it
was
of
a
more
sober
nature
than
any
of
those
pleasures
in
which
i
had
till
then
participated
yet
it
made
a
deeper
and
more
lasting
impression
than
any
of
them
had
made
so
strong
was
it
that
the
very
recollection
of
what
i
then
felt
on
the
first
dawn
of
my
wife
return
to
something
like
her
usual
serenity
and
cheerfulness
gives
me
a
pleasure
even
while
i
am
locked
up
in
my
solitary
dungeon
that
i
believe
it
is
not
the
common
lot
of
man
to
enjoy
those
who
really
know
what
bliss
it
is
to
communicate
as
well
as
receive
true
plea
sure
will
never
voluntarily
inflict
pain
i
think
i
hear
some
of
my
more
sceptical
or
prejudiced
readers
ask
could
these
be
really
the
feelings
of
this
man
is
this
the
man
who
only
two
short
months
before
proposed
to
suckle
his
child
with
his
setter
yes
i
answer
the
very
same
man
nor
in
fact
is
there
to
the
eye
of
reason
any
thing
contradictory
in
his
conduct
on
the
two
occasions
let
me
now
revert
to
my
narrative
though
partly
won
over
by
the
reasons
which
i
had
advanced
my
wife
nevertheless
was
anxious
to
have
some
confirmation
of
them
from
one
of
greater
knowledge
in
such
matters
and
she
accordingly
hinted
a
wish
to
converse
with
the
clergyman
i
told
her
i
had
not
the
least
objection
if
she
desired
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
help
enquiring
what
consolation
she
could
expect
to
derive
from
one
of
those
whom
she
had
frequently
seen
inebriated
at
my
table
and
some
of
whom
when
they
were
in
that
state
had
incautiously
expressed
their
opinions
upon
such
matters
with
so
much
levity
as
to
disgust
her
as
well
as
myself
this
was
too
true
but
yet
the
sanction
of
a
clergyman
carried
great
weight
custom
custom
still
proved
predominant
and
as
i
saw
she
had
set
her
mind
upon
seeing
a
clergyman
before
she
parted
with
the
little
corpse
i
did
not
think
it
either
kind
or
prudent
to
throw
any
impediment
in
the
way
for
three
days
i
had
scarcely
left
her
during
a
single
moment
and
very
fortunately
as
we
lived
in
the
country
we
were
not
pestered
with
any
formal
and
worse
than
officious
calls
of
condolence
i
now
took
my
horse
and
rode
to
a
friend
a
neighbouring
clergyman
and
invited
him
to
dine
and
take
a
bottle
with
me
he
pleaded
a
previous
engagement
but
when
i
told
him
the
object
of
my
visit
after
having
with
a
most
enquiring
eye
looked
me
full
in
the
face
for
half
a
minute
to
discover
whether
i
was
quizzing
him
or
not
he
burst
forth
with
an
exclamation
and
then
into
a
laugh
almost
hysterical
which
having
enjoyed
for
some
time
without
any
interruption
from
me
he
said
why
really
my
good
fellow
i
hope
you
have
too
much
sense
to
listen
seriously
to
the
trash
that
is
preached
up
upon
such
occasions
i
replied
that
he
might
make
himself
easy
not
only
about
me
but
almost
so
with
respect
to
hunt
as
i
had
nearly
argued
her
out
of
all
the
ridiculous
notions
that
she
had
imbibed
but
that
yet
notwithstanding
this
i
should
be
obliged
to
him
as
he
was
one
of
the
elect
who
had
been
inspired
to
take
holy
orders
by
the
holy
ghost
if
he
would
ride
with
me
and
confirm
the
good
work
which
i
had
begun
to
this
he
agreed
on
condition
that
i
would
first
go
with
him
to
course
a
brace
of
hares
of
which
he
had
just
been
informed
by
a
shepherd
this
offer
i
readily
accepted
and
we
returned
to
dinner
together
to
my
house
unfortunately
the
parson
took
nearly
a
bottle
of
wine
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
say
any
thing
to
hunt
upon
the
subject
for
which
he
had
been
invited
and
as
a
bottle
always
set
his
head
a
he
made
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
exhibitions
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
between
his
desire
to
make
hunt
believe
that
he
was
a
learned
and
pious
divine
and
at
the
same
time
his
equal
desire
to
impress
upon
my
mind
that
he
did
not
believe
a
word
that
he
was
preaching
to
her
he
got
into
such
a
mess
that
it
was
with
no
small
trouble
i
was
enabled
to
help
him
at
all
out
of
it
and
at
last
the
tea
coming
in
put
an
end
to
one
of
the
most
ludicrous
scenes
that
ever
was
witnessed
it
happened
very
luckily
that
hunt
was
a
woman
of
good
sterling
sense
and
a
firm
mind
accompanied
by
a
very
quick
penetration
or
he
would
in
his
bungling
desire
to
remove
have
at
least
revived
if
he
had
not
confirmed
all
her
former
doubts
and
scruples
on
the
following
evening
with
considerable
difficulty
i
prevailed
on
the
mother
to
suffer
the
clerk
of
the
parish
to
convey
the
mortal
remains
of
the
little
infant
in
a
neat
coffin
and
deposit
it
in
the
instead
of
partaking
in
any
of
the
long
round
of
christmas
which
we
had
so
unpropitiously
commenced
we
now
spent
our
evenings
at
home
truly
enjoying
the
greatest
of
earthly
blessings
domestic
felicity
how
it
is
possible
for
those
who
have
once
tasted
this
the
sweetest
of
all
human
delights
how
it
is
possible
for
any
rational
mind
afterwards
to
submit
to
be
whirled
round
in
the
vortex
of
dissipation
to
tolerate
to
endure
the
empty
vain
comfortless
nothingness
of
fashionable
amusements
now
appears
to
me
to
be
almost
inexplicable
the
real
felicity
imparted
and
received
in
a
happy
domestic
circle
in
one
evening
far
very
far
surpasses
all
the
pleasures
derived
from
the
gaze
and
throng
of
crowded
routs
and
fashionable
parties
in
a
whole
year
and
yet
it
is
not
practicable
to
convince
young
minds
of
this
perhaps
it
would
be
improper
to
attempt
it
may
we
not
believe
that
few
persons
if
any
can
enjoy
domestic
bliss
to
its
fullest
extent
unless
they
have
previously
experienced
all
the
wearisomeness
all
the
unmeaning
bustle
of
the
crowded
fashionable
society
of
routs
and
balls
happy
however
are
they
if
such
there
be
who
have
minds
so
constituted
as
to
enjoy
the
one
without
having
been
exposed
to
the
previous
probation
of
the
other
the
usual
serenity
and
cheerful
disposition
of
my
wife
soon
returned
she
was
young
blooming
fair
and
sprightly
and
whatever
pleasure
i
had
in
view
i
never
half
enjoyed
it
unless
she
were
a
partaker
of
it
i
have
always
been
one
of
those
mortals
who
think
that
women
were
formed
to
participate
in
all
our
rational
pleasures
and
amusements
and
therefore
with
the
exception
of
hunting
i
seldom
formed
any
scheme
of
pleasure
where
my
wife
could
not
make
one
of
the
party
young
gay
and
thoughtless
as
i
was
and
prone
to
enter
into
all
the
scenes
of
hospitable
and
cheerful
society
one
fault
of
which
i
admit
at
that
period
consisted
in
general
of
much
too
free
an
indulgence
of
the
bottle
after
dinner
yet
however
unfashionable
it
might
have
appeared
i
never
admitted
any
such
visitors
at
my
table
as
rendered
it
necessary
for
females
to
leave
the
room
almost
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
no
language
or
conversation
was
ever
tolerated
at
my
board
to
which
the
most
chaste
female
ear
might
not
listen
without
a
blush
in
fact
no
man
was
ever
permitted
to
enter
my
door
a
second
time
who
once
dared
to
utter
an
indelicate
double
entendre
in
the
presence
of
a
female
even
if
that
female
were
only
a
servant
it
was
therefore
always
the
practice
at
my
table
for
females
to
stay
as
long
as
they
found
it
pleasant
without
being
liable
to
a
disgusting
hint
to
depart
in
order
that
the
men
who
remained
might
have
an
opportunity
of
disgracing
themselves
by
obscene
and
loathsome
conversation
what
a
disgrace
this
to
the
national
character
what
a
blot
upon
the
very
name
of
polished
society
what
an
everlasting
stigma
upon
british
hospitality
what
an
indelible
stain
upon
english
manners
i
always
found
that
young
men
who
had
been
bred
at
the
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
were
the
most
difficult
to
keep
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
the
life
which
these
men
lead
at
college
is
so
dissolute
that
few
of
them
ever
know
how
to
relish
the
sweets
of
domestic
virtuous
society
this
is
the
greatest
drawback
upon
the
religion
of
the
country
and
i
blush
for
the
name
of
religion
while
i
relate
it
i
have
in
one
hour
heard
more
blasphemy
and
more
lewd
language
at
the
table
of
one
of
these
clergymen
of
the
established
church
than
ever
polluted
the
walls
of
my
house
in
all
my
life
i
have
heard
more
obscenity
flow
from
the
lips
of
one
of
these
dignified
pastors
of
the
church
of
england
aye
one
who
resides
in
this
county
too
than
i
ever
heard
come
from
the
lips
of
all
the
reformers
i
was
ever
acquainted
with
in
my
life
i
can
point
out
half
a
score
clergymen
of
this
county
some
of
them
magistrates
who
are
in
this
respect
a
disgrace
to
human
nature
whose
debaucheries
would
fill
a
volume
and
whose
daily
conversation
over
their
bottles
after
they
have
driven
their
wives
and
families
from
their
tables
is
so
degrading
and
consists
of
such
obscenities
that
it
would
even
be
scouted
at
the
table
of
the
bribed
italian
witnesses
in
cotton
garden
yet
some
of
these
canting
hypocrites
i
understand
now
begin
to
prate
about
morality
but
i
ought
and
i
do
apologize
to
the
reader
for
this
digression
which
i
was
led
into
by
the
circumstance
of
a
gentleman
who
dined
with
me
yesterday
having
given
me
a
description
of
one
of
these
monstrosities
who
does
not
live
a
hundred
miles
from
this
place
more
however
of
this
hereafter
should
it
please
providence
to
guard
me
from
poison
and
the
poniard
i
will
plainly
shew
who
are
the
violators
of
all
morality
who
are
the
blasphemers
not
only
of
god
but
of
nature
also
my
wife
as
i
have
already
said
soon
recovered
her
wonted
cheerfulness
which
was
in
no
small
degree
gratifying
to
me
and
as
there
was
also
a
prospect
of
our
being
blessed
with
another
increase
of
our
family
the
loss
of
our
first
child
ceased
to
weigh
so
heavily
upon
our
spirits
my
father
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
satisfaction
at
the
salutary
improvement
in
our
manner
of
living
we
kept
less
expensive
company
and
as
he
said
we
appeared
to
live
more
for
ourselves
although
he
admitted
the
loss
which
we
had
sustained
to
be
a
severe
one
yet
as
it
had
operated
as
a
check
upon
our
giddy
and
extravagant
mode
of
living
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
so
much
regret
it
especially
as
he
saw
there
was
no
great
danger
of
the
name
becoming
he
now
often
paid
us
a
visit
and
i
began
not
merely
to
look
upon
him
as
a
father
but
likewise
to
enjoy
his
society
as
one
of
my
most
valued
companions
and
confidential
friends
at
my
house
he
was
always
a
welcome
guest
and
we
were
always
received
with
the
greatest
kindness
at
his
i
was
now
beginning
to
experience
what
it
is
to
enjoy
true
and
substantial
domestic
comfort
and
i
promised
myself
the
greatest
pleasure
as
well
as
the
greatest
advantage
from
this
friendly
intercourse
with
my
intelligent
and
parent
among
other
things
on
which
he
kindly
admonished
me
he
once
more
pointed
out
to
me
the
folly
as
well
as
the
unprofitableness
and
ingloriousness
of
remaining
in
the
yeomanry
cavalry
which
he
strongly
advised
me
to
quit
while
i
could
do
so
with
credit
to
myself
for
said
he
i
can
not
be
insensible
to
your
situation
i
view
with
a
considerable
degree
of
alarm
your
sanguine
disposition
and
i
fear
that
your
enthusiasm
will
some
day
lead
you
into
some
serious
scrape
with
the
selfish
and
unpatriotic
officers
under
whose
command
you
have
placed
youreself
i
know
that
you
entertain
a
proper
feeling
upon
the
subject
that
you
are
actuated
by
the
most
laudable
and
disinterested
motive
to
serve
your
country
but
when
i
reflect
upon
the
sinister
views
of
those
who
are
your
commanders
i
dread
some
disagreement
with
your
officers
that
may
prove
very
unpleasant
and
then
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
rid
of
your
engagements
without
their
endeavouring
to
fix
a
stigma
upon
you
in
some
way
or
other
i
see
that
already
they
are
all
jealous
of
your
independent
spirit
most
of
your
comrades
are
the
dependants
and
mere
vassals
of
their
officers
you
are
almost
the
only
one
amongst
them
that
can
say
you
are
free
from
any
obligation
to
any
of
them
the
officers
dread
your
spirit
and
the
privates
envy
your
independence
they
are
most
of
them
actuated
by
selfish
views
while
you
on
the
contrary
are
glowing
with
the
amor
patriæ
and
think
of
nothing
but
how
you
can
best
serve
your
country
such
opposite
qualities
will
never
amalgamate
together
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
there
is
great
danger
in
your
situation
i
listened
more
attentively
to
my
father
reasoning
than
i
had
heretofore
done
because
his
predictions
had
proved
so
true
that
i
was
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
and
that
his
superior
knowledge
of
mankind
had
taught
him
how
to
estimate
the
views
and
objects
of
these
men
much
better
than
i
could
but
yet
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
the
yeomanry
at
a
time
when
an
invasion
was
threatened
by
the
french
and
i
therefore
determined
not
to
quit
the
troop
till
the
return
of
peace
during
the
first
year
of
my
marriage
i
had
attended
very
little
to
the
great
political
events
which
had
occurred
on
the
continent
as
well
as
at
home
but
i
shall
slightly
touch
upon
them
here
for
the
information
of
the
on
the
of
the
princess
charlotte
of
wales
was
born
alas
poor
unhappy
princess
on
the
of
february
the
notorious
daniel
stewart
circulated
in
london
for
purposes
a
forged
french
newspaper
called
for
this
fraud
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
a
penalty
of
on
the
third
of
july
in
this
year
bonaparte
gained
the
most
signal
victories
over
wurmser
and
other
austrian
piedmontese
and
italian
commanders
and
at
the
battles
of
lodi
castiglione
rivoli
established
his
character
as
a
brave
and
consummate
general
spain
had
already
towards
the
end
of
concluded
not
merely
a
peace
with
france
but
also
entered
with
her
into
a
treaty
of
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
which
was
this
year
followed
up
by
her
declaring
war
against
great
britain
in
germany
a
suspension
of
arms
was
concluded
between
france
bavaria
wirtemburgh
and
baden
and
saxony
and
hesse
agreed
to
a
neutrality
while
in
italy
peace
was
made
by
parma
sardinia
and
naples
bonaparte
and
the
republican
troops
under
his
command
took
not
less
than
sixty
thousand
prisoners
in
the
course
of
this
campaign
and
repeatedly
drove
before
them
all
the
enemies
of
their
country
pitt
was
intriguing
with
the
court
of
russia
but
the
empress
catherine
being
a
decided
enemy
to
him
she
died
suddenly
and
her
son
paul
who
was
more
friendly
to
his
views
ascended
the
throne
pitt
seemed
determined
at
all
hazards
not
to
make
peace
on
any
terms
but
his
cunning
friend
wilberforce
and
his
partizans
being
alarmed
at
the
continuance
of
the
war
the
minister
was
obliged
to
please
them
and
delude
the
people
for
the
purpose
of
temporising
therefore
he
sent
lord
malmsbury
to
france
under
the
hollow
pretence
of
making
peace
when
at
the
same
time
he
had
orders
not
to
accept
of
any
terms
but
the
french
being
aware
of
the
true
nature
of
his
errand
received
him
coolly
and
after
a
stay
of
eight
weeks
he
was
sent
packing
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
the
parliament
having
been
dissolved
the
new
parliament
met
on
the
of
october
a
fresh
cry
of
invasion
was
now
raised
and
pitt
brought
forward
his
plan
of
defence
these
preparations
caused
great
alarm
throughout
the
country
and
a
great
bustle
amongst
the
various
corps
of
yeomanry
bread
had
sold
at
a
moderate
rate
all
the
year
the
average
price
being
eightpence
halfpenny
the
quartern
loaf
the
loan
which
was
called
the
loyalty
loan
was
eighteen
millions
and
the
amount
was
subscribed
in
fifteen
hours
general
washington
this
year
resigned
the
presidency
of
america
and
retired
into
private
life
amidst
the
blessings
of
his
countrymen
a
pure
and
spotless
patriot
a
friend
to
the
liberty
of
mankind
and
the
brave
assertor
of
those
of
his
fellow
countrymen
thus
ended
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
six
the
next
year
another
attempt
was
made
to
negotiate
a
peace
with
the
french
but
as
the
minister
pitt
was
not
sincere
lord
malmsbury
having
been
sent
to
lisle
to
treat
the
french
directory
soon
discovered
that
the
measure
was
only
a
cheat
intended
to
keep
down
the
dissatisfaction
at
home
the
negotiation
was
therefore
soon
broken
off
like
the
last
ireland
was
in
a
very
disturbed
state
bordering
upon
rebellion
in
the
early
part
of
this
year
many
provincial
banks
stopped
payment
in
consequence
of
a
demand
on
them
for
gold
and
to
complete
the
climax
of
this
country
degradation
and
disgrace
an
act
of
national
bankruptcy
was
declared
on
the
day
of
february
an
order
in
council
being
issued
on
that
day
by
virtue
of
which
the
bank
of
england
stopped
payment
in
cash
from
that
fatal
hour
swindling
the
most
barefaced
swindling
has
become
legalized
on
the
eleventh
of
march
the
king
for
the
first
time
refused
to
receive
the
petition
of
the
common
hall
of
the
city
of
london
upon
the
throne
those
who
took
the
lead
in
the
liveries
at
that
time
basely
surrendering
the
right
of
their
without
a
struggle
and
from
that
hour
their
boasted
privileges
were
lost
and
they
have
ever
since
been
degraded
to
the
level
of
any
common
assembly
as
they
have
never
made
an
effort
to
recover
this
their
natural
right
of
presenting
their
petitions
or
addresses
to
the
king
upon
the
throne
it
must
be
owned
that
they
have
richly
merited
all
the
taunts
and
sneers
of
the
ministerial
press
which
have
been
invariably
levelled
at
them
since
that
period
to
add
to
the
wretched
state
of
the
country
a
mutiny
broke
out
amongst
the
seamen
at
spithead
and
then
at
the
nore
the
latter
of
which
proved
most
formidable
and
some
blood
was
shed
but
at
length
through
the
means
of
promises
and
bribes
the
mutineers
were
induced
to
compromise
for
some
additional
pay
the
alarm
of
invasion
having
been
renewed
with
redoubled
zeal
the
officers
commanding
yeomanry
corps
received
letters
or
circulars
from
the
of
counties
to
enquire
if
in
case
of
the
enemy
landing
they
would
volunteer
their
services
to
the
full
extent
of
their
respective
military
districts
our
district
was
wilts
hants
and
dorset
the
day
was
appointed
for
the
everly
troop
to
assemble
and
to
give
their
answer
to
this
application
in
the
meanwhile
the
officers
were
very
busy
amongst
the
men
particularly
who
was
our
most
active
officer
my
father
informed
me
of
this
and
he
at
once
declared
that
they
the
brave
everly
troop
would
now
they
were
put
to
the
test
refuse
to
go
out
of
their
county
i
however
stoutly
maintained
that
although
the
officers
might
be
so
disposed
it
was
impossible
that
the
men
in
a
body
could
prove
themselves
such
despicable
cowards
as
if
they
did
refuse
to
extend
their
services
they
would
ever
afterwards
be
ashamed
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
my
father
reply
was
mark
my
words
shameful
and
disgraceful
as
it
will
be
yet
i
have
heard
quite
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
a
great
majority
of
them
have
been
and
that
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
refuse
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
government
and
now
young
man
as
i
before
told
you
disgrace
will
be
the
lot
of
the
everly
troop
i
know
the
officers
too
well
to
be
deceived
and
i
should
have
thought
that
the
specimen
you
had
of
their
valour
in
the
salisbury
affair
would
have
completely
opened
your
eyes
unless
indeed
you
are
intentionally
blind
i
told
him
that
i
hoped
they
had
been
so
gibed
and
scouted
in
consequence
of
their
behaviour
upon
that
occasion
that
they
would
be
ashamed
now
to
give
an
open
refusal
to
stand
forward
when
they
were
called
upon
in
such
a
public
manner
why
said
he
one
would
think
it
is
almost
impossible
but
i
know
my
men
so
well
that
i
entertain
not
the
least
doubt
upon
the
subject
and
therefore
you
must
get
out
of
it
as
well
as
you
can
but
let
me
give
you
one
word
of
advice
i
however
began
to
be
impatient
of
advice
upon
such
a
point
for
while
we
had
been
in
conversation
i
had
as
was
usual
with
me
made
up
my
mind
how
to
act
and
i
at
once
told
my
father
that
in
case
they
should
refuse
to
go
i
would
resign
and
enter
instantly
into
some
other
troop
who
had
volunteered
to
extend
their
services
oh
said
my
father
what
you
are
again
ready
to
rush
headlong
into
fresh
difficulties
if
they
refuse
to
extend
their
services
it
will
i
own
be
a
very
fair
ground
for
your
resignation
and
then
you
may
thank
god
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
saving
yourself
from
disgrace
for
disgrace
i
was
always
convinced
such
playing
at
soldiers
must
come
to
at
last
especially
when
i
know
what
sort
of
officers
are
at
your
head
if
you
should
resign
why
not
stay
at
home
with
your
wife
and
attend
to
your
business
depend
upon
it
this
mode
of
acting
will
prove
not
only
much
more
profitable
to
you
but
much
more
honourable
in
the
end
what
can
you
expect
if
you
go
into
another
troop
even
though
they
have
volunteered
yet
you
will
find
that
out
of
a
hundred
of
them
have
entered
into
the
troop
from
some
interested
motive
your
disinterested
patriotic
intentions
will
consequently
only
raise
you
enemies
in
those
who
will
not
know
how
to
appreciate
your
motives
and
those
who
do
comprehend
those
motives
will
only
be
jealous
of
you
because
you
out
do
them
in
devotion
to
the
cause
which
you
wish
to
promote
if
you
must
be
a
soldier
give
me
up
the
farm
and
i
will
buy
you
a
commission
in
some
regular
regiment
at
once
you
may
thus
chance
to
gain
renown
or
an
honourable
death
but
even
there
never
expect
to
obtain
promotion
unless
you
can
conquer
your
unbending
spirit
promotion
is
not
gained
by
merit
but
by
parliamentary
interest
and
by
servility
to
your
superior
officers
take
my
advice
therefore
and
if
the
everly
troop
disgrace
themselves
quit
them
and
think
yourself
well
out
of
what
i
always
thought
was
a
scrape
this
wise
and
salutary
advice
was
not
followed
by
me
though
i
could
not
but
admit
the
propriety
of
it
the
field
day
arrived
and
i
was
one
of
the
first
upon
the
ground
which
was
a
beautiful
sheepdrove
upon
the
downs
between
everly
and
amesbury
i
will
call
this
my
second
campaign
as
the
several
members
of
the
corps
arrived
upon
the
ground
i
eagerly
accosted
them
to
know
their
determination
but
most
of
them
appeared
shy
and
gave
evasive
answers
i
could
however
discover
that
some
of
them
had
got
their
and
these
began
boldly
and
manfully
to
inveigh
against
the
want
of
good
faith
in
the
government
in
thus
striving
to
draw
the
troop
into
a
snare
some
of
them
even
swore
that
it
was
as
bad
as
kidnapping
for
that
the
terms
upon
which
the
troop
had
been
raised
were
that
its
services
should
not
be
required
out
of
the
county
without
the
consent
of
the
persons
who
composed
it
aye
said
i
that
is
very
true
and
we
are
now
i
understand
called
together
to
be
asked
if
we
will
consent
in
case
of
an
invasion
to
go
out
of
the
county
my
speech
was
broken
short
by
some
of
them
espying
our
gallant
cornet
moving
majestically
but
slowly
along
over
the
adjoining
hill
as
he
approached
us
he
was
saluted
by
each
of
the
members
in
their
turn
but
when
he
came
up
to
me
i
fixed
my
eye
upon
him
with
a
scrutinizing
glance
and
so
intent
was
i
in
endeavouring
to
trace
if
possible
his
thoughts
that
i
actually
forgot
to
offer
him
the
accustomed
salutation
till
he
reminded
me
of
my
inattention
by
saying
good
morning
mr
hunt
i
apologised
for
my
absence
of
mind
but
the
fact
was
that
as
i
eyed
our
gallant
commander
the
had
involuntarily
crept
across
my
brain
and
for
the
moment
had
so
absorbed
all
my
attention
that
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
ludicrous
appearance
of
the
mighty
hero
on
the
morn
of
the
battle
of
salisbury
the
bugle
now
sounded
to
announce
the
approach
of
the
gallant
captain
astly
and
the
troop
fell
in
and
was
passed
through
the
various
manoeuvres
by
the
cornet
this
being
over
the
cornet
after
a
short
conference
with
the
captain
formed
us
into
a
circle
within
which
as
far
as
i
recollect
sat
on
their
chargers
the
captain
the
cornet
and
the
rev
polhill
the
chaplain
to
the
troop
who
held
the
principal
farm
at
everly
which
he
rented
of
our
captain
having
read
to
us
the
copy
of
the
secretary
of
state
letter
to
lord
pembroke
the
of
the
county
which
stated
that
an
invasion
was
meditated
by
our
implacable
enemy
the
french
that
the
government
anticipated
almost
daily
an
attempt
to
put
it
into
execution
and
that
his
lordship
requested
to
know
whether
in
case
an
invasion
actually
occurred
the
everly
troop
would
extend
their
services
to
the
military
district
of
hants
wilts
and
dorset
the
cornet
addressed
us
in
a
long
speech
in
this
speech
the
orator
did
not
content
himself
with
leaving
the
decision
to
our
unbiassed
judgments
nor
even
with
hints
of
his
dissatisfaction
at
the
proposal
for
he
boldly
expressed
his
decided
hostility
to
the
measure
and
strongly
reprobated
the
idea
of
farmers
leaving
their
business
by
going
out
of
the
county
his
very
luminous
harangue
appeared
wonderfully
successful
in
convincing
a
great
proportion
of
the
troop
that
by
staying
at
home
and
looking
after
our
farms
and
protecting
our
own
wheat
ricks
we
should
not
only
be
serving
ourselves
but
should
also
be
supporting
the
government
and
opposing
the
invasion
much
more
effectually
than
we
should
be
by
marching
forty
or
fifty
miles
to
the
coast
to
meet
the
enemy
he
proved
to
demonstration
to
his
willing
hearers
that
it
was
our
duty
to
stay
at
home
and
consequently
to
send
an
answer
to
say
that
as
we
had
entered
the
troop
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
in
order
the
turbulent
in
our
own
district
we
did
not
feel
ourselves
justified
in
leaving
the
county
under
any
circumstances
he
however
concluded
in
a
most
heroical
strain
by
declaring
that
in
giving
this
advice
to
the
troop
he
was
not
actuated
by
any
fear
oh
no
of
meeting
the
enemy
on
the
contrary
he
lustily
threatened
that
if
ever
they
should
dare
to
come
into
the
county
of
wilts
at
least
near
everly
or
syrencot
they
should
receive
an
exemplary
chastisement
for
their
temerity
and
all
the
world
should
know
of
what
sort
of
men
the
everly
troop
was
composed
i
listened
to
this
address
with
considerable
impatience
for
such
was
the
effect
of
example
that
i
found
several
of
those
who
in
the
morning
had
expressed
their
determination
at
all
hazards
to
vote
for
going
now
drew
back
and
when
i
looked
at
them
during
this
speech
i
perceived
that
their
eyes
dropped
down
upon
their
holster
pipes
as
soon
as
the
cornet
had
concluded
i
put
spurs
to
my
charger
and
darted
out
of
my
place
into
the
centre
of
the
circle
where
having
doffed
my
helmet
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
addressed
myself
publicly
to
a
body
of
my
i
began
with
these
words
comrades
if
not
at
any
rate
fellow
countrymen
i
then
implored
them
to
reflect
upon
the
consequences
of
sending
such
an
answer
as
had
been
recommended
by
the
cornet
and
i
warned
them
that
if
such
an
answer
were
sent
an
eternal
stigma
would
be
fixed
upon
the
character
of
the
troop
our
conduct
upon
the
salisbury
affair
was
i
told
them
little
known
out
of
the
county
and
we
had
now
an
opportunity
of
wiping
off
the
stain
from
our
character
but
if
we
publicly
and
deliberately
refused
to
go
out
of
our
county
to
meet
the
enemy
in
case
of
invasion
we
should
justly
deserve
to
be
branded
as
poltroons
and
cowards
to
the
latest
posterity
this
language
excited
considerable
signs
of
disapprobation
some
few
laid
their
hands
upon
their
swords
and
i
recollect
two
of
the
troop
gilbert
and
workman
threatened
aloud
i
was
however
not
to
be
deterred
i
proceeded
in
my
address
to
them
and
explained
the
nature
of
the
law
in
case
of
invasion
my
father
having
taken
down
blackstone
commentaries
and
read
to
me
an
extract
respecting
the
i
pointed
out
to
them
that
the
law
compelled
every
man
to
bear
arms
against
invaders
and
that
the
yeomanry
corps
who
had
been
trained
would
of
course
be
among
the
first
who
would
be
compelled
to
act
whether
they
would
or
not
and
that
consequently
if
they
did
not
feel
a
desire
burning
within
their
breasts
either
successfully
to
resist
the
invader
or
fall
gloriously
in
the
attempt
if
they
did
not
possess
any
of
the
yet
sound
policy
ought
to
induce
them
to
offer
voluntarily
those
services
which
the
law
had
the
power
of
inforcing
against
their
will
although
this
was
my
first
attempt
to
speak
in
public
yet
as
my
sentiments
flowed
from
my
heart
as
they
were
the
spontaneous
effusions
of
an
ardent
spirit
burning
with
impatience
to
evince
by
deeds
as
well
as
words
that
i
really
loved
my
country
and
was
willing
to
lay
down
my
life
in
its
defence
and
as
i
felt
indignant
at
the
attempt
that
had
been
made
by
the
cornet
to
seduce
them
as
i
thought
from
their
duty
i
did
not
want
words
to
express
myself
and
i
believe
that
it
was
quite
as
eloquent
a
maiden
speech
as
is
made
by
some
honourable
members
in
the
honourable
house
at
any
rate
it
was
prompted
by
a
conviction
of
public
duty
and
i
have
never
regretted
it
though
i
believe
that
it
made
me
some
rancorous
enemies
who
have
never
lost
an
opportunity
from
that
day
to
this
of
speaking
ill
of
me
behind
my
back
and
doing
me
an
ill
turn
when
they
had
it
in
their
power
the
cornet
scowled
and
many
of
my
comrades
looked
black
and
muttered
dissent
but
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
debate
the
question
at
length
after
having
in
vain
waited
a
short
time
to
see
if
any
one
would
come
forward
to
second
my
proposition
our
worthy
chaplain
the
rev
polhill
gracefully
took
off
his
hat
and
stepped
up
between
me
and
some
of
those
who
unable
to
refute
me
and
dreading
the
result
of
my
appeal
were
almost
disposed
to
draw
their
swords
upon
me
for
the
lecture
which
i
had
given
them
i
shall
never
forget
the
venerable
air
of
this
truly
pious
man
who
was
upwards
of
seventy
years
of
age
it
commanded
instant
attention
and
as
he
fixed
his
eye
steadily
upon
me
the
most
solemn
silence
reigned
around
all
the
angry
passions
that
my
speech
had
excited
were
now
calmed
into
the
most
serious
and
silent
attention
in
the
expectation
that
he
was
about
to
give
me
a
severe
reprimand
for
my
intemperate
and
as
some
considered
it
not
only
indiscreet
but
audacious
speech
after
some
short
pause
he
began
i
was
at
first
rather
in
doubt
what
course
he
meant
to
pursue
though
from
his
well
known
honourable
and
independent
character
i
was
not
in
much
dread
to
the
vexation
and
astonishment
of
the
troop
his
first
sentence
was
a
warm
eulogium
upon
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
eloquent
appeal
to
their
feelings
as
men
and
to
their
hearts
as
englishmen
and
this
compliment
to
me
he
followed
up
with
a
strain
of
impassioned
eloquence
enough
to
have
made
the
veriest
coward
brave
he
repeated
all
my
arguments
but
in
a
style
of
language
far
superior
and
while
the
tears
flowed
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
he
implored
them
to
save
their
character
from
the
disgrace
which
appeared
to
be
hovering
over
them
he
said
that
however
galling
had
been
the
words
which
had
dropped
from
the
lips
of
his
young
friend
yet
as
he
could
not
find
any
others
that
were
more
appropriate
he
himself
must
repeat
them
and
must
plainly
tell
them
that
if
they
returned
such
an
answer
as
was
recommended
by
the
cornet
they
would
deserve
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
poltroons
and
cowards
he
would
he
said
go
still
further
they
would
not
only
deserve
to
be
thus
branded
with
infamy
but
they
would
actually
be
so
and
their
pusillanimity
would
be
a
taint
in
the
blood
of
their
children
children
he
begged
he
prayed
he
intreated
he
implored
that
they
would
not
disgrace
the
name
of
man
by
conduct
at
once
so
cowardly
and
so
foolish
but
he
begged
prayed
intreated
and
implored
in
vain
his
venerable
character
protected
him
from
the
boisterous
disapprobation
that
they
had
shown
towards
me
but
they
heard
him
unmoved
or
rather
as
hogs
would
have
listened
to
the
harmonious
notes
of
orpheus
with
a
still
persisting
however
in
his
efforts
to
wake
a
spark
of
courage
in
their
cloddish
bosoms
he
declared
that
when
the
day
arrived
that
a
foreign
foe
set
foot
upon
british
ground
if
he
could
procure
no
other
conveyance
he
would
crawl
upon
his
hands
and
knees
to
the
coast
to
meet
them
and
there
old
and
feeble
as
he
was
he
would
make
a
bulwark
of
his
shattered
frame
to
check
in
the
first
onset
their
daring
attempt
to
destroy
our
rights
and
liberties
in
fact
he
did
every
thing
that
man
could
do
to
persuade
them
to
perform
their
duty
and
to
save
their
character
from
such
foul
irretrievable
disgrace
it
was
however
all
in
vain
for
with
the
exception
of
myself
and
the
venerable
chaplain
they
all
held
up
their
hands
against
going
out
of
the
county
and
it
was
decided
that
they
should
send
an
answer
to
that
effect
to
the
lord
lieutenant
i
made
one
more
effort
in
a
short
but
spirited
appeal
to
their
honour
as
men
to
their
character
as
englishmen
but
all
remonstrance
was
thrown
away
with
one
accord
they
stamped
the
degrading
name
of
coward
upon
the
colours
of
the
everly
troop
of
yeomanry
and
i
immediately
handed
over
my
sword
and
pistols
or
rather
indignantly
threw
them
upon
the
ground
declaring
that
from
that
hour
i
no
longer
belonged
to
them
and
adding
that
i
would
the
next
morning
enroll
my
name
in
any
corps
which
had
extended
its
services
to
the
military
district
unless
there
was
one
that
had
volunteered
for
unlimited
service
in
which
case
i
would
enroll
my
name
in
that
corps
i
then
shook
bands
with
the
worthy
chaplain
who
warmly
applauded
my
conduct
saying
that
he
never
would
attend
them
again
upon
any
occasion
and
that
he
would
much
rather
have
sacrificed
his
life
than
have
lived
to
see
so
fine
a
body
of
his
desert
at
such
a
moment
their
duty
to
themselves
and
their
country
i
felt
so
ashamed
of
their
conduct
that
i
put
spurs
to
my
horse
and
galloped
from
the
field
in
disgust
lest
by
my
remaining
even
for
a
short
time
i
should
become
contaminated
by
some
portion
of
their
vile
spirit
thus
ended
my
military
career
in
the
everly
troop
of
yeomanry
among
the
members
of
which
were
many
private
friends
for
whom
i
entertained
a
very
sincere
regard
and
who
would
never
have
disgraced
themselves
in
such
a
way
had
it
not
been
for
the
unworthy
recommendation
and
advice
of
their
officers
as
my
father
house
lay
in
my
way
home
i
called
on
him
to
inform
him
of
the
result
of
the
meeting
as
i
rode
into
the
yard
he
met
me
and
seeing
i
had
left
my
sword
behind
ah
he
exclaimed
i
see
that
it
is
just
as
i
predicted
when
i
had
related
to
him
all
that
had
passed
well
said
he
this
is
really
too
bad
to
laugh
at
the
expedition
against
the
old
women
at
salisbury
was
truly
ludicrous
but
this
deliberate
act
of
cowardice
they
never
can
get
over
it
must
and
will
be
blazoned
throughout
the
whole
country
you
have
done
rightly
you
had
no
choice
the
man
who
after
this
decision
remains
a
moment
in
that
troop
must
expect
to
be
laughed
at
and
despised
as
long
as
he
lives
but
mark
my
words
prepare
yourself
for
all
sorts
of
ill
nature
and
slander
they
who
have
not
had
the
spirit
to
follow
your
example
will
never
forgive
you
and
to
gloss
over
their
own
baseness
they
will
load
you
with
all
possible
calumny
and
will
miss
no
opportunity
to
do
you
an
injury
as
by
your
resignation
you
have
exposed
astley
and
dyke
to
great
odium
be
careful
how
you
get
into
their
clutches
or
they
will
squeeze
you
rely
upon
it
i
demanded
how
they
could
injure
me
oh
said
my
father
you
know
but
very
little
of
mankind
they
that
seek
an
opportunity
will
seldom
want
an
occasion
to
do
a
malicious
act
you
have
been
a
great
sporting
crony
of
astley
and
have
frequently
hunted
with
him
he
keeps
a
pack
of
hounds
and
has
hunted
over
my
property
and
my
farms
for
many
years
and
we
have
sometimes
though
sparingly
sported
in
return
over
his
depend
upon
it
this
will
all
be
put
a
stop
to
now
i
replied
that
upon
an
average
astley
had
hunted
ten
times
over
my
father
farms
where
we
had
sported
upon
his
estate
once
that
astley
hounds
met
once
a
week
all
the
season
at
littlecot
furze
and
that
he
could
not
start
a
hare
upon
his
own
estate
or
any
part
of
it
without
a
great
chance
of
her
running
over
some
part
of
my
property
that
is
all
very
true
said
my
father
but
if
he
can
not
be
revenged
of
you
in
any
other
way
he
will
give
up
his
own
hounds
in
order
that
he
may
prevent
you
from
coming
over
any
part
of
his
estate
i
had
often
heard
of
a
man
cutting
off
his
own
nose
to
spite
his
neighbour
but
i
did
not
think
that
in
this
instance
it
was
very
likely
to
happen
trust
me
said
he
within
one
month
he
will
forbid
you
from
going
over
his
lands
therefore
be
on
your
guard
for
be
assured
that
i
know
the
littleness
of
his
soul
better
than
you
do
and
he
will
spare
no
pains
to
be
revenged
upon
you
i
dined
with
my
father
and
returned
home
in
the
evening
whither
i
found
the
news
of
the
disgrace
of
the
everly
troop
had
flown
before
me
my
wife
heartily
approved
of
my
conduct
for
she
came
from
the
wrong
stock
to
approve
of
any
thing
dishonourable
i
was
received
with
open
arms
as
i
always
had
been
but
if
i
had
returned
and
told
my
wife
that
i
was
one
of
the
number
that
had
refused
in
case
of
invasion
to
go
out
of
the
county
to
oppose
the
enemy
i
sincerely
believe
that
i
should
for
the
first
time
have
met
with
a
very
different
reception
at
all
events
i
should
have
deserved
it
on
the
following
morning
before
i
was
quite
dressed
a
messenger
came
with
a
letter
from
lord
bruce
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
wiltshire
yeomanry
i
broke
the
seal
and
read
a
very
flattering
eulogium
from
his
lordship
on
my
gallant
conduct
in
resigning
my
situation
in
the
everly
troop
in
consequence
of
the
troop
having
as
his
lordship
expressed
himself
disgraced
itself
in
such
a
way
as
rendered
it
impossible
for
an
honourable
man
to
remain
in
it
after
paying
me
many
very
high
compliments
he
solicited
the
honour
of
enrolling
in
his
troop
the
marlborough
troop
the
name
of
a
gentleman
who
had
acted
such
a
gallant
part
after
i
had
breakfasted
i
sat
down
to
write
an
answer
but
before
i
had
finished
it
another
messenger
arrived
from
an
officer
of
the
devizes
troop
to
request
that
i
would
honour
that
corps
with
my
name
as
however
lord
bruce
had
applied
first
and
as
in
that
troop
i
happened
to
have
a
particular
friend
thomas
hancock
the
banker
of
marlborough
i
complied
with
his
lordship
pressing
invitation
and
enrolled
my
name
in
the
marlborough
troop
the
next
day
how
true
the
prediction
of
my
father
was
will
be
seen
hereafter
and
it
soon
began
to
be
verified
before
the
week
was
out
i
was
honoured
with
a
visit
from
old
john
sainsbury
the
everly
keeper
who
served
me
with
notices
from
astley
and
all
his
vassals
not
to
trespass
upon
any
part
of
his
estates
or
from
henceforth
i
should
be
treated
as
a
wilful
trespasser
at
the
same
time
he
informed
me
that
his
master
was
grown
exceedingly
fond
of
seeing
the
hares
very
plenty
upon
his
manors
and
that
he
had
of
his
this
was
so
precisely
what
my
father
had
anticipated
that
i
almost
began
to
think
that
he
possessed
some
extraordinary
means
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
intentions
of
men
more
than
those
furnished
by
common
observation
i
sent
my
compliments
to
the
gallant
capt
and
desired
him
to
mark
his
hares
by
burning
them
in
the
horns
and
to
teach
his
keepers
to
persuade
them
to
stay
at
home
for
if
i
caught
any
of
them
straying
upon
my
father
property
i
should
certainly
make
them
pay
forfeit
and
would
if
i
could
prevent
a
single
one
of
them
from
returning
to
tell
the
fate
of
their
companions
the
reader
will
understand
that
the
property
at
everly
belonging
to
astley
joined
my
father
without
any
other
division
than
a
mere
furrow
struck
with
the
plough
between
the
arable
lands
and
that
the
division
between
the
down
lands
consisted
of
old
bound
balls
which
were
merely
small
heaps
of
the
sod
thrown
up
together
perhaps
some
hundred
years
before
so
that
those
who
were
not
aware
of
this
circumstance
might
pass
over
the
plain
twenty
times
without
ever
observing
that
there
was
any
thing
to
mark
the
separation
so
slight
and
imperceptible
are
the
landmarks
that
divide
all
the
estates
that
are
situated
upon
salisbury
plain
the
first
field
day
of
the
marlborough
troop
came
and
i
joined
their
ranks
i
was
fully
equipped
the
whole
of
the
regiment
being
dressed
in
the
same
uniform
as
that
which
was
worn
by
the
everly
troop
no
alteration
was
necessary
and
as
each
person
supplied
himself
at
his
own
expence
with
uniform
and
accoutrements
the
arms
alone
being
given
by
the
government
i
required
nothing
but
a
sword
and
a
brace
of
pistols
with
which
i
was
instantly
provided
my
new
comrades
had
all
volunteered
to
extend
their
services
which
was
my
inducement
for
joining
them
but
they
cut
a
very
sorry
figure
in
the
field
both
as
to
their
accoutrements
and
regimentals
and
they
were
not
half
so
well
mounted
as
my
late
comrades
i
could
have
selected
half
a
score
of
horses
out
of
the
everly
troop
that
were
worth
the
whole
of
those
of
the
marlborough
and
as
for
their
discipline
if
they
had
been
drilled
every
day
for
a
year
they
would
not
have
been
equal
to
the
troop
which
i
had
left
lord
bruce
the
colonel
was
a
complete
novice
and
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
a
serjeant
of
the
of
the
name
of
walker
who
knew
little
more
about
the
matter
than
himself
i
however
attended
from
day
to
day
without
any
one
attempting
to
teach
me
any
thing
there
were
certain
fines
levied
for
particular
faults
in
all
these
troops
such
as
for
absence
without
sufficient
cause
talking
in
the
ranks
coming
to
the
field
too
late
not
being
dressed
in
uniform
but
i
was
never
reprimanded
fined
or
sent
to
drill
while
i
was
in
the
troop
we
had
a
dinner
at
the
castle
at
marlborough
his
lordship
in
the
chair
but
as
most
of
the
troop
were
composed
of
his
father
lord
aylesbury
tenants
and
his
dependants
and
tradesmen
or
belonged
to
the
corporation
of
the
rottenest
of
rotten
boroughs
marlborough
and
great
bedwin
there
were
very
few
except
myself
and
my
friends
hancock
and
hitchcock
who
dared
to
say
their
souls
were
their
own
his
lordship
was
always
very
polite
to
me
but
he
did
not
appear
to
relish
my
delivering
my
sentiments
which
i
did
with
great
freedom
upon
these
occasions
in
the
field
in
the
ranks
i
knew
how
to
conduct
myself
and
never
failed
to
pay
implicit
attention
to
my
duty
nor
ever
deviated
from
the
strictest
discipline
but
when
i
was
at
his
lordship
table
or
at
a
mess
with
the
troop
i
knew
of
no
distinction
i
never
felt
any
other
controul
than
that
which
was
dictated
by
politeness
and
good
manners
perhaps
young
as
i
was
i
might
have
been
thought
to
have
delivered
myself
upon
some
occasions
and
upon
some
subjects
with
too
much
freedom
and
being
always
bred
up
with
the
idea
that
nothing
was
so
base
and
degrading
as
a
slavish
disposition
i
might
in
my
endeavour
to
avoid
this
have
erred
by
falling
too
much
into
the
opposite
extreme
but
the
natural
bent
of
my
disposition
always
led
me
to
avoid
giving
offence
to
any
one
intentionally
my
maxim
was
never
to
offer
an
insult
to
any
one
and
to
be
particularly
careful
not
to
say
any
thing
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
any
person
in
an
inferior
station
of
life
to
my
own
never
to
take
umbrage
lightly
but
if
anyone
be
he
who
he
might
gentle
or
simple
offered
me
a
premeditated
insult
always
to
resent
it
upon
the
spot
whatever
might
be
the
consequence
of
my
so
doing
i
now
contracted
a
very
intimate
acquaintance
with
thomas
hancock
the
banker
and
always
made
his
house
my
home
when
i
went
to
marlborough
though
my
wife
elder
brother
kept
the
castle
inn
where
i
was
always
welcome
this
brother
and
myself
were
however
never
particularly
intimate
for
we
were
of
very
different
dispositions
he
had
been
as
i
have
often
heard
his
father
say
and
himself
acknowledge
a
very
wild
dissipated
youth
but
as
the
wildest
colts
make
the
tamest
horses
so
had
this
gentleman
put
on
a
very
sober
sedate
demeanour
while
he
was
yet
but
a
young
man
and
the
loss
of
his
wife
who
left
him
with
a
large
young
family
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
grave
turn
of
his
mind
his
acquaintance
lay
mostly
among
the
dependents
and
tenants
of
his
landlord
lord
aylesbury
and
as
his
chief
pursuit
appeared
to
me
to
be
directed
towards
amassing
a
fortune
and
as
our
tastes
were
cast
in
a
very
different
mould
our
friendship
though
we
were
upon
very
good
terms
was
not
of
the
inseparable
kind
he
was
very
much
respected
among
the
persons
whom
i
have
before
described
with
whom
he
associated
and
as
he
knew
well
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
he
took
good
care
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
steward
of
lord
aylesbury
nor
as
the
grey
mare
was
always
the
better
horse
in
that
family
did
he
forget
to
pay
due
court
to
the
steward
lady
who
to
my
taste
was
one
of
the
most
disgusting
of
disgusting
women
both
in
person
and
manners
when
he
first
lost
his
wife
who
was
a
pretty
amiable
fascinating
woman
he
seemed
as
if
he
would
sink
under
the
loss
and
we
at
one
time
feared
that
he
would
never
recover
from
his
dejected
state
we
were
however
agreeably
disappointed
as
we
found
that
time
wore
off
the
deepest
afflictions
but
i
own
that
i
imbibed
rather
a
prejudice
against
him
when
i
soon
after
discovered
that
he
was
upon
the
point
of
marrying
another
lady
a
buxom
widow
the
very
reverse
sort
of
woman
to
his
deceased
wife
this
lady
was
the
widow
of
a
grocer
who
had
left
her
some
little
property
and
she
was
therefore
too
much
of
a
lady
to
marry
an
innkeeper
and
she
had
sufficient
influence
over
him
to
make
him
quit
the
inn
and
commence
gentleman
coach
master
before
she
gave
him
her
hand
one
day
in
the
beginning
of
august
in
this
year
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
commence
harvest
by
wheat
reaping
i
received
a
message
from
my
father
to
say
he
wished
to
see
me
as
he
was
not
well
i
enquired
of
the
servant
whether
my
father
was
seriously
indisposed
and
i
received
for
answer
that
he
had
kept
his
bed
all
day
at
this
season
of
the
year
i
had
generally
a
horse
standing
saddled
in
the
stable
and
although
my
dinner
was
just
going
upon
the
table
i
mounted
and
having
desired
my
family
not
to
wait
for
me
i
appeared
at
my
father
who
lived
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
widdington
in
less
time
than
that
in
which
many
persons
who
were
called
active
would
have
put
on
their
boots
and
changed
their
coat
i
had
always
been
bred
up
to
act
with
decision
and
make
all
my
movements
in
quick
time
and
as
the
servant
had
also
made
no
delay
my
father
expressed
his
surprise
and
pleasure
at
the
rapidity
with
which
i
had
attended
to
his
wish
i
found
him
flushed
in
the
face
and
with
a
strong
quick
pulse
he
told
me
that
be
had
had
the
misfortune
to
run
a
thorn
in
his
leg
as
he
was
getting
through
a
hedge
the
day
before
that
he
had
endeavoured
in
vain
to
extract
it
that
it
had
caused
him
considerable
pain
and
had
brought
on
so
much
fever
in
the
night
as
to
produce
delirium
he
had
had
it
fomented
in
the
morning
and
was
in
hopes
that
he
was
better
but
now
the
inflammation
was
so
much
increased
that
he
was
fearful
of
another
restless
night
i
begged
to
see
his
leg
and
i
found
it
to
be
so
much
inflamed
that
i
wished
him
immediately
to
send
for
the
family
surgeon
or
some
better
advice
he
answered
that
if
he
were
not
better
he
would
in
the
morning
in
the
mean
time
he
requested
me
to
look
round
his
farms
and
attend
to
his
servants
i
told
him
that
i
would
most
cheerfully
do
so
but
that
i
must
entreat
him
to
let
me
send
for
some
medical
man
i
had
no
opinion
of
our
family
surgeon
yet
i
thought
as
he
was
a
man
of
very
extensive
practice
that
he
would
at
any
rate
give
my
father
something
to
abate
the
irritation
and
fever
without
the
possibility
of
doing
harm
as
my
father
would
not
consent
to
have
any
other
person
sent
for
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
dispatch
a
messenger
to
pewsey
a
distance
of
five
miles
while
i
rode
round
his
farm
to
see
what
the
servants
were
doing
as
soon
as
i
got
down
stairs
i
mounted
my
horse
and
not
choosing
to
trust
to
the
uncertainty
of
sending
a
servant
i
galloped
the
five
miles
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
doctor
was
from
home
but
i
soon
traced
him
out
and
by
intreaty
i
got
him
to
make
his
old
mare
put
her
best
leg
before
and
he
was
in
a
very
short
time
in
my
father
bed
room
after
having
heard
his
statement
and
examined
his
leg
he
recommended
bleeding
which
was
immediately
performed
young
and
inexperienced
as
i
was
i
suggested
the
propriety
of
some
cooling
cathartick
but
our
doctor
said
no
my
father
required
sleep
he
must
take
a
little
warm
gruel
and
he
would
send
him
some
physick
in
the
morning
as
my
father
felt
drowsy
he
requested
me
to
go
home
and
hoping
that
he
should
have
a
better
night
he
requested
that
i
would
look
after
his
business
next
day
and
that
i
would
come
and
see
him
in
the
forenoon
he
had
a
most
excellent
nurse
in
my
eldest
sister
who
was
his
housekeeper
and
i
left
him
i
own
without
any
sanguine
hopes
of
finding
him
much
better
in
the
morning
although
i
did
not
apprehend
that
any
thing
very
serious
was
likely
to
arise
from
his
accident
when
i
got
home
i
told
my
wife
that
i
was
fearful
my
father
was
laid
up
for
the
harvest
and
i
must
have
her
assistance
more
amongst
my
servants
than
i
had
before
required
of
her
as
i
was
convinced
that
i
should
have
to
attend
to
the
whole
of
my
father
large
and
extensive
business
as
well
as
my
own
and
i
must
make
my
arrangements
accordingly
instead
of
waiting
for
the
forenoon
i
called
upon
my
father
before
the
next
morning
when
i
reached
his
house
my
sister
was
up
she
had
not
been
in
bed
since
i
saw
her
my
poor
father
leg
had
been
very
painful
all
night
and
his
fever
had
again
occasioned
delirium
i
found
him
in
a
burning
fever
and
his
inflammation
alarmingly
increased
in
his
leg
since
i
left
him
he
had
not
he
told
me
slept
a
single
moment
i
at
once
proposed
to
have
better
advice
and
urged
the
necessity
of
procuring
that
advice
in
time
but
who
should
we
get
i
recommended
my
surgeon
robert
clare
of
devizes
my
father
had
always
professed
an
objection
to
him
because
he
said
he
was
a
drinking
profligate
character
but
i
pleaded
that
he
was
an
intelligent
surgeon
and
i
soon
got
over
my
father
scruples
which
i
had
no
sooner
done
than
i
was
for
effecting
the
object
devizes
was
twelve
miles
distant
but
with
me
the
greater
the
distance
the
less
delay
was
to
be
made
i
therefore
ordered
a
trustworthy
servant
to
do
his
best
to
manage
the
business
and
i
was
at
devizes
and
had
called
the
doctor
up
and
was
at
breakfast
before
the
clock
struck
six
in
ten
minutes
after
that
time
our
horses
were
at
the
door
and
the
proper
medicines
being
prepared
i
had
them
in
my
pocket
and
was
mounted
clare
foot
was
also
in
his
stirrup
and
he
was
giving
some
directions
to
his
assistant
when
a
man
came
galloping
up
to
the
door
with
one
of
his
hands
wrapped
up
in
a
handkerchief
streaming
with
blood
we
enquired
what
was
the
matter
to
which
he
replied
that
he
was
a
birdkeeper
and
that
wishing
to
draw
a
charge
of
shot
he
had
held
the
gun
upside
down
with
the
intent
to
shake
the
shot
into
his
hand
but
by
some
accident
the
gun
had
gone
off
and
the
charge
had
passed
through
the
middle
of
his
hand
at
this
moment
up
came
another
man
on
horseback
to
say
that
a
neighbouring
lady
was
taken
in
labour
and
that
the
doctor
or
his
assistant
must
come
that
moment
as
was
missusses
vust
child
and
mayster
was
vrightened
out
of
his
senses
clare
dispatched
duffet
his
assistant
off
to
the
good
lady
in
the
straw
and
then
said
harry
if
you
will
get
off
your
horse
and
assist
me
we
will
manage
matters
for
this
poor
fellow
ah
said
the
man
off
my
as
quick
as
you
can
sir
for
i
have
left
all
the
rooks
eating
my
master
corn
and
i
long
to
get
back
again
to
send
them
about
their
business
the
doctor
smiled
as
he
unbound
his
hand
which
was
in
a
most
shocking
mangled
state
instead
of
proceeding
to
amputate
the
hand
the
doctor
after
having
washed
it
in
warm
water
informed
him
that
he
would
save
his
thumb
and
little
finger
if
he
would
stand
steady
while
he
took
off
the
three
middle
fingers
very
well
sir
if
you
please
but
be
sharp
was
his
i
held
his
arm
and
clare
who
was
a
skilful
surgeon
in
a
very
few
minutes
took
out
the
three
middle
fingers
nearly
up
to
the
wrist
and
having
bound
up
the
wound
and
pressed
the
thumb
and
little
finger
nearly
together
he
desired
the
man
to
ride
slowly
home
and
told
him
that
he
would
see
him
again
on
his
return
from
my
father
the
doctor
always
rode
excellent
horses
and
having
mounted
one
of
his
very
best
and
the
road
lying
over
the
downs
we
arrived
at
my
house
twenty
minutes
before
eight
i
had
already
ridden
a
distance
of
miles
clare
having
examined
my
father
leg
pronounced
the
case
to
be
a
serious
one
and
at
once
recommended
that
grant
an
eminent
surgeon
of
bath
should
be
called
in
as
well
as
hill
a
physician
for
form
sake
from
devizes
he
said
to
my
father
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
man
of
an
uncommonly
firm
mind
i
know
you
will
not
be
alarmed
sir
but
we
must
have
good
advice
and
assistance
or
your
leg
is
in
such
a
state
that
i
fear
amputation
may
be
necessary
i
have
therefore
desired
your
son
to
send
or
go
for
grant
of
bath
to
assist
me
who
is
one
of
the
most
eminent
men
in
the
profession
my
father
firmly
replied
if
you
think
sir
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
never
wait
for
grant
but
take
off
my
leg
at
once
no
sir
replied
clare
i
shall
not
advise
that
at
present
i
will
do
all
that
is
necessary
for
you
now
but
let
your
son
depart
for
grant
immediately
i
know
your
expedition
and
i
know
that
he
will
be
more
likely
to
prevail
upon
grant
to
come
than
any
one
we
can
send
in
the
mean
time
i
will
bring
over
hill
from
devizes
and
see
you
in
the
afternoon
this
was
so
settled
and
without
delay
i
had
changed
my
horse
and
galloped
back
to
devizes
with
clare
in
my
way
to
bath
as
we
passed
along
he
informed
me
seriously
that
my
father
was
not
merely
in
a
dangerous
state
but
that
he
had
not
even
the
slightest
hopes
of
his
recovery
i
was
i
had
hardly
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
my
father
at
the
age
of
was
one
of
the
most
healthy
vigorous
active
men
in
the
kingdom
and
had
scarcely
ever
had
a
day
serious
illness
in
his
life
to
see
him
walk
ride
mount
his
horse
or
in
fact
do
any
thing
he
was
so
active
so
alert
that
his
motions
were
more
like
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
twenty
than
those
of
an
old
man
and
to
look
upon
him
no
one
would
guess
his
age
to
be
much
above
forty
though
his
hair
lead
been
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
for
years
the
truth
was
that
he
had
all
his
life
been
an
active
temperate
prudent
man
and
at
the
age
of
sixty
his
constitution
had
never
received
a
single
shock
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
he
had
never
been
ill
since
he
had
the
small
pox
which
he
caught
in
the
natural
way
when
a
boy
at
the
age
of
eight
years
in
the
he
frequently
shamed
myself
as
well
as
all
the
young
men
of
the
village
for
he
was
the
most
polite
and
attentive
man
i
ever
saw
if
a
lady
dropped
her
fan
her
shawl
her
handkerchief
nay
even
a
pin
he
was
the
first
to
spring
to
her
aid
and
pick
it
up
and
this
he
would
do
in
less
time
than
one
of
our
modern
yawning
lounging
dandies
would
take
to
drawl
out
pray
maam
shall
i
have
the
honour
he
would
take
a
cheerful
bottle
and
make
one
of
the
merriest
of
the
gayest
party
but
never
to
excess
for
he
was
arrived
at
that
time
of
life
that
he
knew
how
to
enjoy
every
pleasure
in
moderation
he
had
acquired
wealth
sufficient
for
all
his
wants
and
enough
to
assist
a
friend
and
where
he
had
a
confidence
he
was
unlimited
in
his
generosity
if
he
saw
a
man
persecuted
unjustly
he
was
sure
to
become
his
friend
in
one
respect
this
had
led
him
into
a
great
error
he
having
advanced
to
a
brewer
of
bath
as
much
as
seven
thousand
pounds
without
much
better
than
personal
security
he
had
the
finest
farms
in
that
part
of
the
county
and
they
were
cultivated
like
gardens
no
man
was
surrounded
with
brighter
prospects
or
was
possessed
of
greater
worldly
blessings
and
when
clare
seriously
told
me
that
he
had
no
hopes
of
his
recovery
i
was
absolutely
overpowered
with
astonishment
and
anguish
and
was
incapable
of
uttering
a
single
sentence
if
said
he
your
father
ever
recovers
it
will
be
a
miracle
it
is
too
late
to
attempt
amputation
if
i
had
seen
him
yesterday
before
he
was
bled
his
life
might
have
been
saved
but
my
opinion
is
that
if
the
pewsey
doctor
had
taken
a
pistol
and
shot
him
through
the
head
he
would
not
have
been
more
instrumental
to
his
death
than
he
was
at
the
moment
when
he
took
a
pound
of
blood
from
him
in
the
state
in
which
his
leg
must
have
been
last
night
between
you
and
i
he
is
a
murdered
man
and
i
do
not
believe
that
all
the
surgeons
on
earth
can
save
him
without
a
miracle
but
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
i
know
you
will
not
be
long
riding
the
thirty
miles
to
bath
when
you
return
call
at
my
house
and
leave
word
at
what
time
grant
will
come
and
i
will
accompany
him
to
littlecot
either
or
morning
as
you
go
through
devizes
call
likewise
upon
old
hill
the
physician
and
make
him
ride
over
this
afternoon
we
must
let
him
earn
a
guinea
or
two
as
he
wants
it
badly
enough
and
there
is
no
chance
of
his
doing
any
harm
for
he
will
not
venture
to
alter
what
i
have
ordered
unless
i
am
present
as
soon
as
grant
comes
we
will
do
our
best
though
i
assure
you
i
can
not
give
you
any
hopes
as
i
had
to
ride
a
distance
of
sixty
miles
i
calculated
the
time
i
should
be
on
the
road
and
as
i
was
to
go
thither
and
back
on
the
same
horse
and
it
was
very
hot
weather
i
somewhat
slackened
my
pace
that
i
might
not
knock
up
the
poor
animal
as
i
passed
through
devizes
i
left
word
for
hill
to
repair
immediately
to
my
father
and
without
loosing
one
single
moment
for
my
own
refreshment
i
reached
my
friend
at
the
brewery
in
walcot
street
a
few
minutes
before
one
having
come
the
thirty
miles
in
some
thing
less
than
three
hours
two
men
were
instantly
set
to
clean
and
refresh
my
horse
to
prepare
him
for
my
return
while
i
hastened
to
find
grant
he
was
visiting
his
patients
for
he
at
that
time
had
the
best
practice
in
bath
seeing
my
distress
his
servant
readily
accompanied
me
to
that
part
of
the
town
where
he
was
most
likely
to
meet
with
his
master
and
we
soon
found
the
doctor
coming
out
of
a
house
in
brock
street
upon
my
accosting
him
with
considerable
earnestness
and
agitation
he
invited
me
to
return
with
him
into
the
house
where
i
informed
him
of
my
earnest
desire
that
he
should
proceed
forthwith
in
a
chaise
and
four
to
see
and
if
possible
save
my
father
to
this
pressing
application
he
replied
that
sorry
as
he
was
to
be
obliged
to
refuse
he
must
nevertheless
do
so
it
being
impracticable
for
him
to
leave
bath
but
he
added
that
his
old
friend
bob
clare
was
as
able
a
man
and
as
good
a
judge
how
to
proceed
in
such
a
case
as
himself
or
any
surgeon
or
physician
in
england
i
urged
that
it
was
most
particular
wish
that
he
should
come
that
clare
had
not
time
to
write
or
he
would
have
explained
that
it
was
a
peculiar
case
i
then
described
it
together
with
the
symptoms
as
well
as
i
could
he
shook
his
head
and
said
at
once
i
fear
if
i
could
go
that
i
should
be
too
late
that
pewsey
doctor
can
kill
much
easier
than
i
can
cure
the
taking
of
blood
away
at
such
a
moment
was
most
stupid
it
was
most
damnable
he
ought
to
have
put
blood
into
him
instead
of
taking
it
away
i
fear
after
that
there
is
no
hopes
what
says
bob
clare
i
am
sorry
to
say
sir
that
you
are
too
well
agreed
in
your
opinion
but
for
god
sake
lose
no
time
to
fly
and
do
your
utmost
to
save
the
best
of
parents
he
repeated
that
it
was
impossible
for
that
he
had
the
most
important
engagements
that
evening
to
break
which
would
never
be
pardoned
either
by
his
patients
or
by
the
medical
men
who
were
coming
over
one
of
them
from
clifton
on
purpose
to
meet
him
he
said
however
that
he
would
recommend
me
to
a
friend
who
would
perhaps
be
able
to
attend
me
and
he
assured
me
that
he
was
a
very
clever
man
quite
as
capable
as
himself
in
such
an
affair
no
this
would
not
do
for
me
clare
wished
the
assistance
of
grant
and
i
would
not
accept
of
any
one
else
i
implored
i
wept
and
in
agony
of
supplication
i
knelt
and
seized
his
knees
declaring
that
i
would
not
loose
my
hold
till
he
had
promised
to
go
to
see
my
father
i
offered
him
any
sum
that
he
might
demand
and
assured
him
that
i
would
engage
to
procure
such
post
horses
as
would
take
him
there
and
back
in
six
hours
he
gazed
upon
me
with
astonishment
at
length
be
exclaimed
your
uncommon
filial
piety
has
triumphed
no
money
should
have
induced
me
to
leave
bath
under
my
present
circumstances
but
such
devotedness
such
unfeigned
and
unusual
affection
in
a
son
for
a
father
i
never
before
witnessed
and
turning
round
to
the
lady
of
the
house
who
with
her
two
daughters
had
been
drawn
to
the
spot
by
my
raving
agony
he
said
i
should
be
for
ever
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
did
not
yield
to
the
prayers
of
such
unbounded
filial
affection
then
addressing
me
return
said
he
my
young
friend
and
inform
clare
that
i
will
take
him
up
in
the
morning
at
six
and
we
will
be
at
your
father
before
eight
i
see
that
you
think
there
is
great
delay
in
this
but
nothing
on
earth
could
induce
me
to
leave
bath
before
i
have
seen
my
patients
here
i
have
an
important
engagement
a
consultation
which
will
not
be
concluded
before
one
in
the
morning
instead
of
going
to
bed
i
will
start
at
two
in
a
chaise
with
four
horses
and
will
be
at
devizes
by
six
and
do
you
take
care
that
bob
is
ready
so
as
not
to
keep
me
waiting
for
i
shall
be
there
to
a
minute
i
could
not
help
sighing
and
looking
doubtfully
and
as
he
took
my
hand
i
said
are
you
sure
that
you
will
come
are
you
sure
that
nothing
will
prevent
you
my
good
lad
he
replied
in
our
profession
we
are
so
often
put
in
mind
of
the
uncertainty
of
life
that
we
are
sure
of
nothing
but
but
this
you
may
rely
upon
that
if
i
am
alive
and
able
to
come
i
will
be
at
devizes
at
six
and
at
your
father
by
eight
i
thanked
him
most
earnestly
and
enquired
if
i
could
do
any
thing
to
forward
his
good
intention
by
hiring
or
bespeaking
the
horses
for
his
carriage
to
this
enquiry
he
replied
that
his
servant
would
take
care
of
that
but
that
i
might
order
horses
to
be
ready
for
him
at
devizes
i
consequently
assured
him
that
four
of
the
best
post
horses
in
the
kingdom
should
be
ready
and
waiting
for
him
at
clare
door
by
the
time
he
arrived
there
and
this
i
could
safely
promise
as
i
had
the
interest
to
procure
such
from
the
bear
inn
i
now
took
leave
of
him
and
he
gave
me
the
most
friendly
salutation
and
so
did
the
lady
and
her
two
daughters
who
had
looked
and
listened
to
my
entreaties
with
a
great
degree
of
interest
nor
had
they
confined
themselves
to
silent
good
wishes
for
they
had
most
fervently
joined
in
supplicating
the
doctor
to
comply
with
my
request
and
they
now
expressed
their
earnest
hopes
for
the
recovery
of
my
father
which
was
balm
to
my
ears
i
returned
to
my
friend
where
i
had
left
my
horse
and
having
taken
some
slight
refreshment
i
proceeded
without
loss
of
time
towards
home
such
a
melancholy
journey
i
never
took
before
nor
have
ever
taken
since
my
mind
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
reflection
that
it
was
possible
i
should
so
soon
lose
the
best
of
fathers
of
whose
real
value
i
seemed
never
to
have
had
a
true
estimation
till
now
that
i
felt
the
dread
of
losing
him
a
thousand
sad
forebodings
hurried
across
my
brain
and
i
began
already
to
feel
that
i
had
lost
the
best
the
truest
and
the
most
sincere
friend
whom
i
had
in
the
world
thus
it
is
with
poor
weak
mortals
they
seldom
know
how
to
appreciate
the
most
inestimable
blessings
till
they
are
in
danger
of
being
deprived
of
them
in
this
sad
state
i
soon
reached
devizes
a
distance
of
nineteen
miles
on
my
return
scarcely
having
noticed
any
of
the
objects
which
i
had
passed
i
called
upon
clare
and
left
a
note
for
him
to
be
ready
by
six
in
the
morning
and
i
ordered
four
of
the
best
post
horses
at
the
bear
to
be
in
waiting
at
clare
door
at
that
hour
then
without
making
any
other
delay
i
spurred
forward
and
reached
my
father
house
within
a
few
minutes
of
three
i
found
him
much
in
the
same
state
as
when
i
left
him
at
eight
in
the
morning
my
journey
to
bath
and
back
i
had
completed
including
my
stay
there
in
seven
hours
having
now
ridden
in
the
whole
upon
two
horses
a
distance
of
miles
my
poor
father
who
had
been
anxiously
expecting
my
return
expressed
great
satisfaction
at
my
speed
and
taking
my
hand
he
said
ah
you
are
a
generous
soul
i
told
your
sister
that
if
you
could
find
grant
in
any
reasonable
time
you
would
return
by
three
i
knew
the
horse
would
carry
you
the
sixty
miles
in
six
hours
and
i
also
knew
that
nothing
on
earth
would
delay
you
when
your
father
health
probably
his
life
was
at
stake
well
added
he
what
says
grant
will
he
come
yes
sir
he
will
be
here
by
eight
in
the
morning
or
before
in
the
mean
while
i
find
that
clare
has
ordered
you
to
take
some
medicine
that
he
has
sent
and
has
he
not
ordered
any
thing
to
be
done
to
my
leg
no
fomentation
or
any
other
thing
no
sir
why
then
said
he
i
fear
he
gives
it
up
for
lost
because
unless
something
is
done
to
stop
the
inflammation
that
is
going
on
there
a
mortification
must
follow
and
having
said
these
words
he
sunk
back
upon
his
pillow
resigned
and
composed
his
leg
was
not
quite
so
painful
as
it
had
been
for
the
fact
was
that
mortification
had
actually
taken
place
when
clare
first
saw
it
in
the
morning
my
father
now
said
that
after
my
very
great
exertion
in
riding
such
a
distance
which
he
had
reckoned
up
while
i
was
gone
as
being
miles
rest
must
be
necessary
for
me
and
he
therefore
did
not
choose
that
i
should
ride
any
farther
for
fear
i
should
make
myself
ill
also
otherwise
he
felt
a
great
desire
to
know
how
the
reaping
went
on
as
neither
of
us
had
seen
the
reapers
since
they
began
i
gaily
told
him
i
was
not
at
all
exhausted
and
that
if
such
a
thing
could
in
the
least
add
to
his
pleasure
or
his
comfort
i
knew
that
i
could
ride
to
bath
and
back
again
without
any
difficulty
i
added
that
as
to
the
reapers
i
had
anticipated
what
would
be
his
wish
and
consequently
before
i
came
in
i
had
ordered
the
saddle
to
be
put
upon
his
horse
and
after
my
sister
had
given
me
some
tea
i
intended
to
see
all
the
reapers
both
upon
his
farms
and
my
own
ah
my
dear
son
he
replied
it
must
be
all
yours
during
this
harvest
at
any
rate
no
cure
that
can
be
performed
upon
me
will
enable
me
to
get
about
during
this
harvest
i
am
delighted
with
your
alacrity
to
please
me
and
as
i
have
full
confidence
in
you
and
know
your
capability
i
shall
not
give
myself
one
moment
uneasiness
about
the
business
having
taken
some
tea
with
my
father
and
sister
i
mounted
the
third
horse
and
rode
round
the
fields
and
saw
every
one
of
the
reapers
and
other
servants
i
recollect
that
there
were
reapers
at
work
in
my
father
fields
and
in
mine
making
in
the
whole
one
hundred
and
four
persons
who
had
that
day
begun
reaping
our
wheat
crop
which
was
remarkably
fine
i
had
an
opportunity
for
the
first
time
since
i
left
home
which
was
about
three
in
the
morning
to
call
and
see
my
wife
of
whom
i
had
not
had
a
sight
though
i
had
passed
by
the
house
both
in
going
and
returning
to
devizes
and
back
and
to
bath
and
back
four
times
during
the
day
i
informed
her
of
the
true
situation
of
my
father
and
told
her
that
i
should
return
and
sit
up
with
him
all
night
by
the
time
i
had
performed
my
task
it
was
between
nine
and
ten
and
i
had
literally
tired
the
third
horse
my
poor
father
objected
so
strongly
to
my
sitting
up
that
about
twelve
i
retired
to
an
adjoining
room
to
rest
myself
but
to
sleep
i
found
it
impossible
i
rose
again
at
four
and
after
i
had
enquired
how
he
had
passed
the
night
i
rode
again
round
the
farms
more
to
pass
away
the
hours
previous
to
the
arrival
of
the
surgeons
and
the
physician
than
for
any
other
purpose
a
little
before
eight
according
to
their
appointment
they
drove
into
the
yard
in
grant
chariot
with
four
horses
oh
god
what
a
moment
for
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
agitated
state
of
my
mind
divided
as
it
was
between
hope
and
fear
at
the
same
instant
that
i
hastened
them
to
the
of
my
father
i
would
have
given
any
thing
to
have
delayed
the
fatal
decision
but
no
time
was
to
be
lost
seeing
the
agony
in
which
i
stood
speechless
before
them
grant
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
my
good
young
friend
you
must
exert
all
your
courage
and
be
prepared
for
the
worst
my
old
friend
clare
has
given
me
such
a
description
of
your
father
leg
that
i
have
no
hopes
of
a
favourable
result
old
hill
the
physician
now
said
come
come
grant
do
you
bear
up
do
not
make
the
young
man
there
are
a
great
many
slips
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
it
is
not
so
bad
as
you
imagine
good
heaven
what
a
strong
recollection
i
at
this
moment
have
of
the
look
of
scorn
and
contempt
which
grant
bestowed
upon
the
old
devizes
physician
he
did
not
utter
a
word
but
his
look
was
enough
having
informed
my
father
of
their
arrival
they
all
three
proceeded
to
his
a
most
awful
anxious
moment
for
me
and
i
never
before
prayed
so
devoutly
for
any
thing
in
my
life
as
i
now
did
for
a
propitious
decision
from
grant
after
the
first
salutation
was
over
the
surgeons
began
to
examine
his
leg
and
grant
pointed
out
to
clare
a
deep
red
streak
that
passed
up
the
inside
of
his
thigh
quite
up
to
the
body
he
asked
my
father
whether
he
had
any
objection
to
have
his
leg
opened
to
which
my
father
promptly
replied
not
in
the
least
i
beg
you
will
do
any
thing
you
think
proper
grant
then
said
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
a
pretty
deep
incision
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
inflamed
part
proceed
as
you
please
sir
said
my
father
i
am
quite
capable
of
bearing
pain
clare
then
made
an
incision
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
three
inches
deep
quite
down
to
the
bone
and
five
or
six
inches
in
length
the
flesh
appeared
as
black
as
mahogany
and
very
little
blood
flowed
this
my
father
bore
without
the
least
flinching
some
cloths
were
wrapped
round
it
and
they
desired
him
to
lie
down
and
compose
himself
a
little
i
will
lie
down
sir
he
replied
but
i
hope
that
i
do
not
appear
discomposed
all
this
while
i
stood
like
a
statue
as
pale
as
ashes
watching
every
look
of
grant
with
intense
anxiety
well
sir
said
grant
i
will
consult
with
clare
who
understands
these
matters
quite
as
well
as
i
do
and
in
fact
as
well
as
any
surgeon
in
england
and
we
will
settle
the
course
you
shall
follow
your
leg
is
in
a
dreadful
state
but
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
grant
now
took
my
father
by
the
hand
and
was
wishing
him
good
morning
when
my
father
holding
his
hand
firmly
raised
himself
upon
his
bed
and
said
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
grant
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
to
come
such
a
long
journey
to
see
me
and
my
son
will
most
cheerfully
remunerate
you
there
is
however
one
thing
more
which
i
shall
request
you
to
do
before
you
leave
me
it
is
that
you
will
give
me
your
candid
and
honest
opinion
of
my
situation
have
you
any
hopes
of
my
recovery
if
you
have
not
you
will
confer
a
great
obligation
upon
me
by
saying
so
doctor
hill
who
was
standing
at
the
other
side
of
the
bed
prevented
any
answer
by
saying
come
come
hunt
you
are
low
spirited
come
come
you
must
not
indulge
in
any
such
notions
you
will
do
very
well
again
by
and
by
upon
which
my
father
turning
indignantly
round
replied
with
a
firm
and
rather
strong
voice
stand
back
and
keep
your
peace
for
once
hill
and
do
not
expose
yourself
i
am
neither
nor
so
weak
as
to
be
put
off
by
your
cant
have
the
modesty
at
any
rate
to
listen
with
patience
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
grant
who
appears
to
be
a
sensible
honest
man
or
else
be
so
obliging
as
to
leave
the
room
then
turning
back
to
grant
he
said
i
have
sir
contrived
so
to
live
as
not
to
fear
to
die
you
are
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
but
you
have
the
character
of
knowing
your
profession
well
and
also
of
being
a
humane
man
at
least
my
son
informs
me
that
you
have
been
induced
to
take
this
journey
more
from
humanity
than
for
your
fee
i
have
therefore
a
perfect
reliance
upon
your
judgment
with
respect
to
my
case
you
see
that
i
have
nerve
to
hear
my
fate
and
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
and
it
will
afford
me
even
comparative
consolation
to
be
informed
of
it
from
your
lips
rather
than
be
left
in
suspence
nay
i
appeal
to
your
humanity
to
speak
the
truth
boldly
at
once
to
save
my
poor
afflicted
son
the
pain
of
communicating
it
having
said
this
my
father
paused
to
receive
a
reply
oh
what
an
agonising
moment
was
this
for
me
grant
took
my
father
hand
and
seriously
delivered
himself
as
follows
after
what
you
have
said
sir
after
the
calm
and
manly
appeal
which
you
have
made
to
me
and
with
so
laudable
and
rational
a
desire
to
spare
pain
to
the
feelings
of
your
son
i
should
be
doing
an
injustice
to
my
own
sense
of
duty
and
be
imposing
upon
you
if
i
were
to
withhold
any
longer
my
honest
opinion
which
is
this
that
as
a
mortification
had
taken
place
for
many
hours
even
before
clare
first
saw
you
and
as
it
has
approached
your
body
i
can
not
unless
some
very
extraordinary
interposition
of
providence
shall
occur
see
any
hopes
of
your
recovery
my
father
who
during
this
sad
speech
had
looked
him
firmly
in
the
face
calmly
and
rather
cheerfully
replied
i
thank
you
sir
most
sincerely
i
am
content
the
lord
will
be
done
pray
take
care
of
my
poor
son
the
last
words
of
the
doctor
had
produced
such
an
awful
effect
upon
me
that
unperceived
by
them
i
had
sunk
senseless
into
a
chair
as
soon
as
i
recovered
a
little
i
was
led
out
of
the
room
more
dead
than
alive
and
even
at
this
moment
the
words
of
grant
vibrate
afresh
upon
my
ear
though
i
had
anticipated
such
an
answer
and
had
indeed
no
reason
to
expect
any
other
yet
when
the
blow
came
it
was
much
more
stunning
much
more
overwhelming
than
i
had
any
idea
of
i
was
dumb
with
sorrow
i
now
by
cruel
experience
understood
what
dumb
sorrow
meant
i
could
neither
speak
nor
give
vent
to
my
feelings
by
tears
the
agony
of
my
poor
sister
who
saw
enough
to
convince
her
what
was
the
fatal
sentence
and
who
immediately
went
into
violent
hysterics
was
the
first
thing
that
recalled
me
to
myself
the
sight
of
her
distress
roused
me
from
my
lethargy
yet
it
was
with
a
sort
of
stupor
that
i
moved
to
her
assistance
and
when
she
had
in
some
degree
recovered
my
brain
was
still
whirled
round
and
bewildered
i
had
received
such
a
shock
that
all
the
world
appeared
as
one
vacant
blank
before
my
eyes
clare
at
length
called
my
attention
to
the
wish
of
mr
grant
to
return
and
the
chaise
being
brought
to
the
door
he
reminded
me
of
the
doctor
fee
i
asked
clare
what
would
be
proper
to
which
he
replied
that
twenty
guineas
would
be
handsome
i
however
gave
him
thirty
with
which
he
expressed
himself
very
well
satisfied
and
on
his
departure
he
politely
requested
that
he
might
be
numbered
among
my
friends
i
made
my
friend
clare
promise
to
return
in
the
evening
and
poor
hill
who
had
eyed
with
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
envy
the
large
sum
paid
to
grant
received
his
two
guineas
for
his
two
visits
and
left
the
place
cursing
i
have
no
doubt
grant
in
his
heart
for
having
spoken
out
so
plainly
as
to
render
his
future
visits
useless
and
thereby
deprived
him
of
three
or
four
more
guineas
in
fees
the
moment
they
were
gone
i
returned
to
my
father
endeavouring
to
suppress
my
sorrow
as
much
as
possible
taking
me
by
the
hand
he
said
most
tenderly
my
dear
son
though
i
do
not
feel
myself
weak
yet
as
we
must
part
so
soon
pass
as
much
of
your
time
with
me
as
you
conveniently
can
for
i
feel
at
present
in
very
sound
mind
and
i
shall
be
enabled
to
give
you
some
good
advice
which
i
hope
will
be
of
lasting
service
to
you
and
as
it
will
be
given
at
such
a
time
as
this
i
am
sure
that
it
will
sink
deep
into
your
heart
in
the
first
place
you
must
not
give
way
to
sorrow
for
you
must
be
a
father
to
your
sister
and
to
your
unfortunate
little
brothers
who
are
at
school
in
london
i
shall
not
for
one
moment
repine
upon
my
own
account
i
am
not
afraid
to
meet
a
merciful
creator
he
is
not
the
implacable
being
that
some
find
it
their
interest
to
represent
him
i
always
have
had
and
shall
to
the
last
continue
to
have
full
and
implicit
confidence
in
his
loving
kindness
and
mercy
be
you
therefore
calm
and
temperate
in
your
grief
and
consider
that
you
have
a
great
duty
to
perform
it
must
be
your
task
to
comfort
your
father
in
his
last
moments
when
perhaps
by
the
exhaustion
of
his
bodily
powers
he
may
become
weak
in
mind
if
this
be
the
divine
will
which
however
may
heaven
avert
be
it
your
care
to
soothe
to
comfort
and
to
cherish
and
if
possible
collect
and
controul
my
wandering
senses
promise
me
that
you
will
not
leave
me
long
at
a
time
in
you
i
place
my
trust
and
i
know
you
will
not
deceive
me
i
solemnly
assured
him
that
i
would
not
leave
the
house
nay
said
he
do
not
say
so
all
our
large
farms
with
two
or
three
hundred
servants
require
your
attendance
sometimes
but
do
not
leave
me
long
at
a
time
i
feel
no
symptoms
of
my
approaching
end
send
for
your
wife
she
will
comfort
and
be
a
good
companion
for
your
sister
and
will
assist
her
to
nurse
me
i
know
that
you
will
all
make
me
as
comfortable
as
you
can
while
i
remain
here
to
which
i
replied
by
entreating
him
not
to
doubt
my
affectionate
attention
clare
and
grant
had
both
told
me
that
they
thought
it
impossible
that
he
could
live
more
than
three
days
at
the
most
as
the
mortification
had
approached
the
vital
as
he
was
a
very
hearty
strong
man
with
a
sound
constitution
it
was
possible
that
he
might
live
full
three
days
but
nevertheless
as
some
change
might
bring
on
his
dissolution
much
sooner
he
ought
they
said
to
lose
no
time
in
settling
his
affairs
he
himself
began
on
this
subject
by
saying
you
know
that
i
made
my
will
since
your
mother
death
and
i
see
no
cause
to
alter
the
distribution
of
my
property
i
have
dealt
fairly
by
all
my
children
you
will
possess
the
manor
and
estate
of
glastonbury
by
heirship
in
addition
to
what
i
have
given
you
i
wish
to
make
a
codicil
to
appoint
you
a
trustee
in
the
place
of
one
of
those
whom
i
appointed
when
you
were
a
minor
my
uncle
powell
my
mother
brother
who
was
named
as
a
trustee
and
his
attorney
were
therefore
sent
for
and
the
necessary
alteration
was
made
without
delay
and
without
giving
my
father
any
trouble
or
uneasiness
whatever
as
the
mortification
encreased
his
leg
grew
less
painful
and
in
the
night
he
had
some
sweet
sleep
but
i
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
leave
his
for
a
moment
i
devoured
every
syllable
that
fell
from
his
lips
and
i
thought
i
had
suffered
the
greatest
loss
if
he
required
any
thing
and
i
was
not
upon
the
spot
to
furnish
him
with
it
my
sister
was
quite
knocked
up
nature
was
and
as
i
now
found
the
assistance
of
hunt
to
be
absolutely
necessary
she
was
sent
for
in
the
morning
without
her
we
should
have
been
greatly
at
a
loss
for
my
poor
sister
was
now
more
in
need
of
being
nursed
herself
than
able
to
assist
in
nursing
my
father
whom
we
contrived
to
keep
perfectly
easy
and
free
from
any
serious
pain
till
his
death
his
amazing
strength
of
constitution
went
beyond
the
calculation
of
the
doctors
for
he
lived
four
days
and
nearly
five
nights
after
the
mortification
had
visibly
passed
into
his
body
during
the
whole
of
this
time
even
to
the
very
last
he
was
perfectly
sensible
and
not
till
he
ceased
to
exist
did
he
cease
to
possess
all
his
faculties
in
the
soundest
state
the
next
morning
after
grant
had
been
and
confirmed
his
approaching
end
he
begged
to
have
my
sister
piano
forte
brought
up
into
his
bed
room
and
when
he
grew
fatigued
with
giving
me
his
kind
admonitions
he
was
much
pleased
and
refreshed
by
my
sister
playing
and
singing
he
was
always
passionately
fond
of
music
and
was
a
tolerable
amateur
himself
and
it
appeared
to
give
him
as
much
pleasure
as
ever
to
hear
her
play
and
sing
angels
ever
bright
and
fair
sacred
music
was
mostly
his
choice
upon
this
occasion
yet
he
would
sometimes
request
a
lively
and
cheerful
air
these
tunes
frequently
lulled
him
into
a
sweet
sleep
which
he
now
and
then
enjoyed
for
an
hour
at
a
time
during
which
period
i
never
failed
to
watch
over
him
with
the
most
pious
care
never
suffering
him
to
be
disturbed
upon
any
occasion
during
the
whole
of
this
time
he
talked
of
his
approaching
dissolution
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
composure
and
he
gave
orders
how
he
would
be
buried
and
named
those
of
his
servants
who
should
carry
him
to
the
church
to
lay
him
by
the
side
of
his
dear
elizabeth
he
often
repeated
pope
universal
prayer
and
frequently
expressed
his
gratitude
that
he
did
not
feel
as
his
beloved
wife
elizabeth
had
done
at
her
decease
the
moment
of
which
he
greatly
lamented
was
clouded
with
doubts
and
fears
a
circumstance
which
he
had
always
attributed
to
bodily
weakness
and
he
prayed
devoutly
to
the
author
of
his
being
not
to
suffer
his
mind
to
be
impaired
while
he
had
life
in
his
body
he
felt
that
he
had
lived
the
life
of
an
honest
man
and
had
never
failed
in
strictly
doing
his
duty
towards
his
neighbours
he
declared
that
he
had
gone
regularly
to
church
as
an
example
to
his
servants
and
his
family
but
believed
that
one
private
act
of
devotion
was
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
a
benificent
and
divinity
than
any
mere
outward
form
of
public
worship
it
was
he
said
the
greatest
consolation
to
him
in
his
last
trial
to
reflect
that
he
had
been
honest
and
upright
in
all
his
dealings
and
that
in
his
conduct
to
his
fellow
creatures
he
had
uniformly
kept
in
view
the
sublime
precept
of
do
unto
others
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
this
he
said
was
his
chief
consolation
in
the
hour
of
trial
and
he
most
emphatically
urged
us
to
follow
his
example
particularly
in
that
respect
as
honesty
was
the
best
policy
recalling
to
his
memory
and
mentioning
all
the
little
menial
errors
that
he
had
committed
he
assured
us
that
they
gave
him
not
the
least
uneasiness
that
god
was
too
wise
too
just
too
good
and
too
forgiving
to
record
such
faults
and
to
make
his
creatures
suffer
for
them
where
they
had
not
been
vicious
and
premeditated
in
this
way
for
four
days
he
spent
the
close
of
his
existence
principally
with
me
urging
and
inculcating
every
good
honest
and
noble
principle
cautioning
me
against
the
effects
likely
to
result
from
my
great
enthusiasm
and
pointing
out
to
me
the
path
which
he
thought
would
lead
to
happiness
honour
and
renown
and
he
constantly
offered
up
the
most
pious
and
devout
thanks
to
heaven
for
having
permitted
him
to
remain
so
long
after
he
had
received
notice
of
his
approaching
dissolution
as
to
enable
him
to
give
me
so
much
good
advice
he
anticipated
that
i
should
do
well
and
prosper
in
the
world
if
my
daring
independent
spirit
did
not
lead
me
into
difficulties
he
continued
to
express
great
doubts
about
the
prudence
of
my
remaining
in
the
yeomanry
cavalry
he
said
that
he
had
always
dreaded
some
great
evil
would
arise
out
of
it
to
me
and
he
submitted
whether
it
would
not
be
much
to
my
advantage
to
leave
it
his
death
would
he
said
be
a
most
ample
reason
for
my
quitting
it
as
i
should
have
such
a
large
business
upon
my
hand
that
it
would
require
every
moment
of
my
time
to
attend
to
it
and
if
you
want
an
excuse
added
he
say
it
was
one
of
the
last
wishes
of
your
father
that
you
should
do
so
but
recollect
my
dear
son
i
do
not
bind
you
down
to
any
promise
of
the
sort
i
only
throw
out
this
hint
if
you
choose
to
make
an
excuse
i
must
however
say
that
an
honourable
and
brave
man
should
never
think
it
necessary
to
make
any
excuse
for
doing
that
which
be
deems
right
and
proper
you
will
recollect
these
observations
and
feel
their
justice
after
i
am
dead
and
gone
when
you
will
have
no
sincere
friend
to
advise
and
admonish
you
i
own
i
wish
i
could
have
lived
another
year
or
two
for
your
sake
as
we
were
now
just
begun
to
live
as
father
and
son
ought
to
live
upon
the
most
friendly
footing
you
would
have
assisted
and
protected
me
in
my
old
age
and
i
know
and
you
will
so
feel
that
i
should
have
been
of
the
most
important
service
to
you
you
decide
too
hastily
you
are
quick
and
impetuous
your
young
hot
blood
leads
you
on
incautiously
into
unnecessary
dangers
and
difficulties
the
truth
is
you
are
young
and
therefore
i
would
not
have
you
otherwise
disposed
than
you
are
i
have
long
discovered
a
noble
generous
spirit
to
be
the
ruling
passion
of
your
soul
and
all
your
faults
even
result
from
an
amiable
and
a
praiseworthy
enthusiastic
desire
to
excell
you
only
want
prudence
and
experience
to
direct
you
but
that
experience
which
you
might
have
acquired
from
me
you
must
now
purchase
to
have
lived
to
direct
to
advise
and
admonish
you
would
have
been
a
great
happiness
to
me
but
the
will
be
done
i
have
given
you
a
good
education
i
have
made
you
a
complete
master
of
your
business
as
a
farmer
god
has
blessed
you
with
a
strong
mind
and
a
sound
body
and
few
young
men
of
your
age
will
begin
the
world
with
brighter
prospects
you
will
have
a
large
business
upon
your
hands
that
will
keep
you
out
of
idleness
though
in
fact
i
do
not
suspect
you
of
any
tendency
to
idleness
but
i
hope
this
fine
business
will
keep
you
out
of
mischief
you
must
be
a
father
to
your
poor
little
brothers
who
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
require
double
care
your
uncle
powell
has
promised
that
he
will
take
care
of
your
sisters
but
be
sure
and
give
them
repeated
advice
not
to
be
led
away
against
their
better
judgment
to
adopt
his
form
of
religion
that
of
a
quaker
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
the
quakers
but
i
have
always
found
the
church
of
england
quite
good
enough
for
those
who
have
been
bred
up
in
that
persuasion
i
do
not
think
any
one
would
be
justified
in
dissenting
from
the
church
of
england
till
he
has
acted
up
to
all
the
christian
precepts
of
that
church
but
now
that
we
are
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
the
church
of
england
mark
what
i
say
upon
my
death
bed
it
will
i
know
sink
deeper
into
your
young
mind
than
any
thing
that
i
could
have
said
at
any
other
time
do
not
my
dear
son
for
one
moment
imagine
that
i
wish
to
inculcate
the
idea
that
as
i
approach
my
maker
i
profess
to
believe
all
those
mummeries
that
i
have
hitherto
dared
to
disbelieve
and
dispute
you
know
that
i
never
joined
in
saint
athanasius
creed
all
such
unchristian
denunciations
i
ever
held
and
i
still
hold
to
be
blasphemous
impositions
many
of
the
forms
of
the
church
also
are
superstitious
and
ridiculous
but
the
moral
precepts
of
the
christian
faith
are
wise
and
good
i
have
never
meddled
in
religious
discussions
i
have
always
formed
my
own
opinion
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
and
belief
and
if
in
any
of
those
opinions
i
have
erred
i
have
not
the
least
shadow
of
doubt
upon
my
mind
that
a
wise
just
and
beneficent
creator
and
father
of
all
will
pardon
my
errors
i
do
not
feel
the
least
disposed
now
to
investigate
or
puzzle
myself
in
my
last
moments
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
enquire
whether
i
have
been
right
or
wrong
the
lord
will
be
done
say
i
and
may
he
in
his
goodness
assist
you
to
continue
an
honest
and
an
upright
man
amongst
your
fellow
men
do
your
duty
by
your
neighbour
and
worship
your
maker
agreeably
to
the
dictates
of
your
own
conscience
and
you
will
live
happy
and
when
the
time
comes
for
recollect
that
it
must
come
with
all
and
when
it
comes
with
you
my
dear
son
may
you
be
as
well
prepared
as
your
father
is
to
enter
the
presence
of
your
maker
i
have
i
think
shewn
the
reader
enough
to
impress
him
with
the
idea
of
the
incessant
pains
the
unwearied
exertion
of
my
excellent
parent
to
inculcate
the
true
principles
of
honour
morality
and
religion
upon
the
mind
of
his
son
he
well
knew
that
what
he
said
upon
these
matters
at
such
an
awful
period
was
sure
to
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
the
memory
of
his
son
for
whose
benefit
he
appeared
to
live
even
to
the
last
when
at
times
he
became
exhausted
with
his
anxiety
to
serve
me
he
would
say
now
my
dear
boy
go
down
stairs
and
get
some
refreshment
while
i
meditate
while
i
commune
with
god
in
private
and
silently
adore
his
goodness
come
again
soon
but
in
the
mean
time
do
not
let
any
one
disturb
my
meditations
when
i
crept
quietly
back
again
i
sometimes
found
him
with
his
hands
clasped
still
in
the
act
of
silent
prayer
on
seeing
me
he
would
cease
and
say
it
is
all
well
and
then
he
would
return
to
the
most
interesting
discourse
with
me
at
other
times
i
found
him
in
the
most
sweet
and
delightful
sleep
his
countenance
as
placid
as
in
the
most
happy
and
prosperous
moments
of
his
life
as
if
he
were
blessed
with
health
and
spirits
he
always
awoke
cheerful
and
apparently
refreshed
and
would
relate
some
delightful
dream
which
he
had
had
frequently
consisting
of
a
happy
meeting
and
heavenly
conversation
with
his
dear
departed
elizabeth
my
mother
god
of
heaven
what
did
i
not
feel
in
those
interesting
and
trying
moments
any
weeping
any
gloomy
sorrow
in
his
presence
he
forbad
for
he
said
we
all
ought
to
bless
the
hour
and
to
rejoice
to
see
a
beloved
parent
upheld
at
such
a
moment
by
his
creator
so
as
to
be
enabled
to
die
with
such
serenity
and
firmness
and
to
set
such
an
example
to
his
children
in
this
manner
passed
away
three
days
and
nights
after
grant
had
pronounced
it
impossible
for
my
father
to
recover
as
all
the
medical
men
had
agreed
that
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
survive
more
than
two
days
i
had
every
now
and
then
a
faint
hope
that
the
strength
of
his
constitution
would
overcome
the
mortification
clare
however
who
attended
daily
repressed
that
hope
by
pronouncing
it
impossible
for
my
father
to
live
his
predictions
were
verified
by
the
event
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
it
was
evident
that
my
parent
grew
weak
his
voice
failed
him
he
had
much
greater
difficulty
in
holding
any
conversation
and
his
breathing
was
much
less
frequent
yet
he
was
calm
and
cheerful
and
felt
pleasure
in
hearing
my
sister
play
upon
the
which
caused
him
a
short
slumber
after
each
tune
about
the
middle
of
the
day
he
desired
to
be
alone
with
me
and
taking
my
hand
with
a
benignant
smile
he
said
in
a
weak
but
tender
tone
my
dearest
son
your
father
time
for
quitting
this
mortal
life
is
arrived
i
find
that
the
hand
of
death
is
upon
me
after
a
pause
of
half
a
minute
to
recover
from
the
exertion
he
continued
you
will
soon
lose
your
best
and
truest
friend
i
would
not
wish
to
make
you
a
misanthropist
i
would
not
because
it
is
unnatural
at
your
age
have
you
suspect
all
mankind
but
of
this
you
may
rest
assured
that
there
are
few
very
few
in
the
world
who
will
not
flatter
you
if
they
can
get
any
thing
by
it
there
are
none
who
will
tell
you
of
your
faults
with
the
candid
kindness
of
a
friend
some
indeed
may
taunt
you
with
them
in
order
to
irritate
and
provoke
you
but
before
another
sun
rises
you
will
have
lost
the
only
one
who
must
be
naturally
anxious
to
advise
and
admonish
you
with
a
pure
and
disinterested
friendship
young
and
sanguine
as
you
are
you
will
be
thrown
upon
the
wide
world
to
think
and
act
for
yourself
but
your
prospects
are
bright
your
father
has
done
his
best
for
you
and
in
his
last
moments
he
will
pray
for
your
success
and
happiness
in
life
my
only
sorrow
is
at
leaving
your
little
unfortunate
brothers
you
must
be
a
father
to
them
and
i
have
left
them
an
ample
fortune
to
repay
you
well
for
any
trouble
you
may
have
with
them
i
know
you
will
be
a
kind
brother
to
them
and
i
hope
in
return
that
they
will
be
grateful
to
you
i
have
little
dread
on
your
account
for
though
you
are
young
yet
god
and
your
father
have
done
their
duty
towards
you
so
bountifully
that
there
is
every
prospect
of
your
doing
well
in
the
world
i
only
wish
i
could
have
lived
to
have
seen
you
well
out
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
recollect
my
last
words
you
will
always
find
the
best
policy
therefore
always
unto
others
as
you
would
that
they
should
do
unto
you
and
take
care
so
to
live
that
when
death
calls
you
may
be
prepared
to
follow
him
as
i
now
am
in
humble
but
confiding
hope
and
without
repining
my
poor
father
held
me
firmly
by
the
hand
and
looked
me
steadily
in
the
face
though
his
eyes
grew
dim
and
his
voice
was
so
interrupted
by
the
difficulty
of
respiration
which
now
much
increased
that
he
was
greatly
exhausted
at
length
he
sunk
gently
back
upon
his
pillow
ejaculating
the
lord
will
be
done
the
lord
be
praised
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
death
had
overspread
his
face
with
a
sombre
hue
he
held
my
hand
about
three
hours
but
never
spoke
more
lying
all
the
while
perfectly
still
apparently
without
the
least
pain
or
uneasiness
either
in
body
or
mind
in
this
state
he
continued
till
near
eight
in
the
evening
of
the
of
august
when
the
best
of
fathers
drew
his
last
breath
and
gently
slid
into
the
arms
of
death
without
a
groan
a
struggle
or
even
a
sigh
to
the
inexpressible
grief
of
his
affectionate
and
son
his
hand
still
retained
its
hold
of
mine
and
i
now
gave
vent
to
that
unbounded
sorrow
which
i
had
heretofore
suppressed
and
smothered
because
i
would
not
make
him
uneasy
it
is
to
me
in
my
dungeon
a
source
of
pleasure
to
reflect
that
all
that
it
was
possible
for
one
man
to
do
to
save
the
life
of
another
i
did
to
save
his
life
and
at
any
one
moment
after
his
doom
was
pronounced
by
the
doctors
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
life
nay
if
i
had
had
a
thousand
lives
i
would
have
died
by
torture
a
thousand
times
to
have
saved
his
life
but
he
had
taught
me
not
only
by
precept
but
by
example
to
bow
to
the
will
of
god
there
never
lived
a
better
man
nor
a
better
father
nor
did
ever
a
son
sustain
a
greater
loss
than
i
did
by
his
death
it
has
been
said
with
great
truth
that
he
was
the
second
founder
of
his
family
after
he
drew
his
last
breath
i
remained
kneeling
by
his
absorbed
in
grief
and
silent
prayer
for
nearly
an
hour
before
any
one
of
the
family
came
to
me
at
length
my
wife
came
to
my
aid
and
being
roused
by
her
i
performed
the
sad
sacred
office
of
closing
his
eyes
for
ever
i
shall
not
make
any
apology
to
the
reader
for
having
dwelt
so
long
on
this
melancholy
scene
i
trust
that
it
will
prove
one
of
the
most
instructive
parts
of
my
history
in
fact
and
in
truth
i
would
not
write
another
line
if
i
did
not
fondly
hope
that
almost
every
part
of
my
life
may
prove
instructive
as
well
as
entertaining
to
my
fellow
creatures
and
the
rising
generation
particularly
to
those
who
may
embark
upon
the
wide
rough
boisterous
and
dangerous
ocean
of
politics
when
i
recite
my
own
errors
and
it
has
already
been
seen
that
i
have
committed
many
and
great
ones
i
am
rewarded
for
the
pain
i
feel
in
the
recollection
of
them
by
the
hope
that
they
may
prove
a
beacon
and
a
warning
to
those
young
persons
who
may
do
me
the
honour
to
read
these
pages
and
where
they
find
that
the
impulse
of
honourable
generous
feelings
unguided
by
prudence
has
led
me
into
a
wrong
course
i
trust
that
the
young
reader
will
learn
from
my
mistakes
how
to
temper
his
zeal
with
that
discretion
which
may
enable
him
to
steer
clear
of
those
perilous
quicksands
upon
which
i
have
so
frequently
struck
what
a
great
misfortune
for
me
was
the
death
of
my
father
before
i
was
yet
years
of
age
with
a
mind
unformed
and
i
may
say
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
phrase
very
young
of
my
age
here
was
i
left
in
the
uncontrolled
possession
of
one
of
the
largest
farming
concerns
in
the
kingdom
i
had
a
young
wife
and
a
family
of
my
own
coming
on
and
had
five
sisters
and
brothers
younger
than
myself
left
without
father
or
mother
i
was
immediately
obliged
to
attend
to
the
farms
which
had
had
no
master
to
look
over
them
for
the
last
week
that
week
the
most
busy
one
in
the
year
and
i
had
likewise
to
give
orders
for
the
funeral
of
my
departed
father
exertion
was
indispensable
it
was
no
use
for
me
to
lie
down
and
cry
god
help
me
necessity
however
painful
to
my
feelings
compelled
me
to
see
to
every
thing
because
i
had
no
friend
either
to
do
it
for
me
or
even
to
assist
me
the
whole
lay
upon
the
hands
of
myself
and
my
wife
who
was
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
my
poor
sister
who
almost
sunk
under
her
afflicting
loss
it
was
fortunately
fine
weather
and
the
wheat
harvest
was
nearly
finished
before
my
father
was
buried
when
the
awful
day
of
his
funeral
came
i
performed
the
last
sad
and
solemn
office
for
him
as
i
had
faithfully
promised
to
him
that
i
would
and
saw
him
laid
by
the
side
of
my
poor
mother
in
the
silent
grave
the
tomb
and
vault
of
his
ancestors
in
the
chancel
of
the
parish
church
of
enford
in
the
county
of
wilts
this
melancholy
scene
made
the
most
lasting
impression
upon
my
memory
and
such
was
the
effect
of
the
kind
benevolent
and
endearing
conversations
which
i
had
held
with
my
father
during
the
four
last
days
of
his
life
after
he
knew
that
he
could
not
survive
his
illness
that
for
seven
years
afterwards
i
used
in
my
sleep
to
hold
the
most
delightful
converse
in
my
dreams
with
the
spirit
of
my
beloved
parent
in
all
of
which
he
appeared
most
anxious
for
my
welfare
and
advised
admonished
and
kindly
cautioned
me
against
every
impending
evil
so
that
he
was
not
only
the
best
of
fathers
when
living
but
he
proved
my
kind
and
fostering
guardian
angel
after
his
death
no
young
man
ever
had
better
advice
bestowed
upon
him
than
i
had
unceasing
kind
and
paternal
advice
as
well
as
the
best
example
nor
was
any
one
ever
more
sensible
of
the
great
and
irreparable
loss
be
had
sustained
than
i
was
or
ever
more
sincerely
deplored
the
loss
of
a
beloved
parent
than
i
did
the
loss
of
my
father
mine
was
not
that
sort
of
sorrow
which
puts
on
a
gloomy
outside
the
garb
of
woe
while
the
heart
beats
to
a
merry
tune
but
though
i
did
not
assume
any
hypocritical
outward
sorrow
yet
i
was
really
and
truly
most
sad
at
heart
the
constant
employment
of
the
body
and
the
full
occupation
of
the
mind
is
however
always
the
very
best
antidote
to
grief
and
those
my
business
furnished
me
with
to
the
fullest
extent
when
my
father
died
what
he
rented
and
what
he
left
of
his
own
was
nearly
all
the
tything
of
littlecot
as
well
as
chisenbury
farm
and
i
was
in
possession
of
widdington
farm
about
two
miles
distant
all
the
farms
were
now
in
my
occupation
and
as
i
thought
it
proper
to
live
more
centrical
i
took
chisenbury
house
a
large
handsome
mansion
and
as
soon
as
i
could
fit
it
up
and
furnish
it
i
went
to
reside
there
this
was
considered
by
some
as
being
rather
an
imprudent
and
extravagant
step
for
it
would
require
a
considerable
income
to
keep
up
an
establishment
such
as
a
house
like
that
demanded
the
reader
will
be
able
to
estimate
its
size
when
i
inform
him
that
there
were
not
less
than
fifty
two
windows
in
it
to
be
paid
for
to
the
assessed
taxes
the
number
of
them
however
i
had
the
prudence
to
reduce
considerably
but
in
spite
of
all
my
prudence
it
could
not
considering
the
scale
on
which
my
arrangements
were
formed
be
otherwise
than
a
very
expensive
residence
still
it
was
not
more
perhaps
than
i
was
fairly
entitled
to
as
the
profits
arising
from
my
large
well
cultivated
farms
enabled
me
to
vie
with
men
of
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
in
my
domestic
establishment
my
stables
were
stored
with
hunters
my
kennels
with
dogs
my
cellars
were
well
stocked
with
wine
and
the
best
old
october
and
my
table
always
amply
furnished
the
best
of
viands
to
my
friends
my
wife
who
was
quite
as
fond
of
company
as
i
was
made
her
female
guests
uniformly
welcome
we
kept
a
hospitable
house
and
we
never
wanted
for
company
to
fill
it
or
a
parson
to
say
grace
to
a
good
dinner
at
this
time
we
had
another
daughter
born
and
every
thing
went
most
prosperously
with
me
in
the
world
my
friend
clare
of
devizes
who
was
a
sporting
man
purchased
at
lord
audley
sale
a
handsome
curricle
which
he
offered
me
and
we
soon
struck
a
bargain
curricles
were
all
the
vogue
at
that
time
therefore
a
dashing
young
man
without
a
curricle
was
nothing
and
as
my
wife
was
a
great
driver
as
well
as
a
good
horsewoman
a
curricle
was
almost
indispensable
let
no
one
suppose
from
reading
this
that
i
was
become
a
careless
squanderer
the
habits
of
economy
which
almost
from
my
infancy
i
lead
imbibed
in
consequence
of
the
example
that
i
had
always
before
my
eyes
did
not
desert
me
even
under
these
circumstances
by
management
i
lived
as
well
kept
as
good
a
house
and
had
my
whole
establishment
so
arranged
as
to
make
quite
as
good
an
appearance
for
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
a
year
as
many
persons
make
who
spend
more
than
thrice
that
sum
i
had
at
all
times
plenty
of
money
and
i
had
every
comfort
and
luxury
about
me
but
in
the
midst
of
all
this
apparent
extravagance
i
never
forgot
the
poor
all
my
servants
were
well
paid
and
well
fed
and
i
scarcely
ever
failed
to
attend
the
parish
pay
table
to
see
that
those
who
held
the
office
of
overseer
turned
no
one
away
who
was
really
in
distress
without
affording
him
relief
thus
early
i
gained
the
character
of
being
friend
of
the
i
always
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
widow
the
orphan
the
aged
and
infirm
and
being
the
largest
paymaster
in
the
parish
to
the
fund
of
the
poor
i
never
pleaded
in
vain
the
idle
the
indolent
and
the
dissolute
i
left
to
fight
their
own
battles
but
the
infirm
the
aged
the
widow
and
the
orphan
never
fruitlessly
sued
when
i
was
present
and
as
i
have
just
said
i
seldom
failed
to
attend
if
i
did
i
was
sure
to
hear
complaints
my
readers
will
recollect
that
i
am
writing
these
memoirs
during
the
of
hundreds
who
can
speak
to
this
fact
and
i
speak
of
it
not
as
boasting
but
with
the
firm
conviction
that
it
can
be
substantiated
by
hundreds
who
lived
in
the
parish
and
that
there
is
not
one
who
will
contradict
it
the
of
the
is
a
title
which
i
earned
very
early
in
life
and
i
hope
that
i
shall
deserve
to
carry
it
to
my
grave
sorry
however
as
i
should
be
to
lose
this
honourable
title
i
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
lose
it
than
lose
the
reflection
that
i
have
always
been
their
friend
not
for
the
name
but
for
the
pleasure
i
felt
in
protecting
and
assisting
my
less
fortunate
when
they
were
in
distress
it
may
be
said
if
you
are
really
so
why
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
pleasure
of
knowing
it
why
do
you
sound
your
own
trumpet
and
endeavour
to
blazon
it
forth
to
the
world
my
answer
is
because
my
being
incarcerated
here
for
years
and
six
has
induced
me
to
become
my
own
historian
and
i
will
endeavour
to
be
so
faithfully
and
i
feel
that
i
have
need
to
put
upon
record
all
my
good
qualities
as
a
to
balance
my
bad
qualities
of
the
latter
i
have
disclosed
a
great
many
already
and
as
i
proceed
i
shall
have
to
record
still
more
now
as
we
are
told
that
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
if
i
possess
this
good
quality
of
charity
and
if
i
prove
that
i
always
exercised
it
i
think
i
should
not
be
doing
common
justice
to
myself
or
to
my
friends
if
out
of
false
modesty
i
were
to
keep
silence
those
who
have
read
my
work
hitherto
will
not
fail
to
have
discovered
that
from
my
early
days
i
have
proved
myself
to
have
been
animated
by
an
ardent
love
of
country
that
i
possessed
a
sort
of
inherent
patriotism
without
having
at
all
entered
into
politics
a
patriot
i
consider
to
be
a
man
who
is
devoted
to
the
laws
and
constitution
of
his
country
in
their
purity
a
defender
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
people
and
one
who
does
his
best
to
promote
their
happiness
and
welfare
merely
possessing
the
good
quality
of
being
charitable
by
no
means
makes
a
patriot
therefore
i
am
not
professing
any
claim
to
patriotism
on
the
ground
of
my
being
at
that
period
a
friend
to
the
poor
in
the
first
place
i
believe
that
charity
and
a
sympathy
for
the
sufferings
of
my
are
inherent
qualities
of
my
breast
at
any
rate
i
know
that
i
felt
them
in
all
their
purity
as
long
ago
as
i
can
remember
in
the
next
place
i
was
taught
to
practice
charity
by
the
example
of
my
amiable
and
excellent
mother
who
possessed
as
much
christian
charity
as
well
as
piety
as
any
mortal
that
ever
lived
she
was
indeed
the
very
milk
of
human
kindness
and
although
my
father
taught
me
to
exercise
the
virtue
with
more
discretion
yet
he
never
checked
it
when
my
father
died
he
was
the
vicar
churchwarden
as
well
as
the
principal
overseer
of
the
parish
of
enford
and
of
course
as
i
came
into
possession
of
his
estates
and
farms
in
that
parish
i
continued
in
the
parochial
offices
as
his
substitute
till
the
next
easter
during
that
time
it
was
a
severe
winter
and
i
exercised
my
own
discretion
and
without
any
ceremony
raised
the
pay
of
the
poor
particularly
of
the
aged
and
infirm
those
whose
labours
were
done
i
found
their
pay
at
two
shillings
and
sixpence
per
week
each
i
raised
it
to
three
and
sixpence
each
and
in
some
instances
as
in
cases
of
infirmity
still
higher
and
when
some
of
the
parishioners
mentioned
their
objections
to
the
measure
i
declined
to
reduce
the
allowance
but
offered
to
pay
out
of
my
own
pocket
the
advance
which
i
had
made
in
case
of
my
conduct
being
disapproved
of
at
a
meeting
or
vestry
no
meeting
was
however
called
nor
in
this
large
parish
where
the
population
is
above
six
hundred
was
there
any
complaint
made
to
the
magistrates
by
any
pauper
against
me
during
the
whole
time
i
was
in
office
when
easter
came
i
being
the
largest
paymaster
in
the
parish
it
was
my
turn
by
rotation
to
serve
the
office
two
years
longer
and
my
name
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
list
that
was
sent
in
to
the
magistrates
for
their
approval
the
practice
is
for
the
parishioners
at
the
annual
easter
meeting
to
send
in
a
list
of
three
or
four
names
to
give
the
magistrates
a
choice
in
the
appointment
of
two
but
as
the
two
names
that
are
placed
first
and
second
are
those
that
are
considered
by
the
resident
proprietors
as
the
proper
persons
and
whose
turn
it
is
to
serve
the
office
the
magistrates
seldom
or
ever
without
some
very
substantial
reason
pass
them
over
and
appoint
any
of
the
others
whose
names
are
placed
as
a
mere
form
below
them
in
this
parish
which
was
known
to
be
well
conducted
the
circumstance
of
passing
over
the
recommendation
of
the
principal
inhabitant
was
never
known
to
have
happened
my
name
being
the
first
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
remain
in
this
disagreeable
and
troublesome
office
i
was
however
deceived
my
disposition
to
give
to
the
poor
more
liberal
relief
than
had
been
heretofore
granted
to
them
had
been
too
evident
during
the
short
time
that
in
the
winter
season
i
had
been
in
office
the
considerable
and
permanent
advance
that
i
had
made
to
all
the
old
people
in
the
parish
who
were
no
longer
able
to
labour
had
got
wind
and
this
was
canvassed
amongst
the
magistrates
who
were
all
farmers
some
of
them
very
large
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
and
who
should
be
the
magistrates
of
this
district
but
the
valorous
officers
of
the
gallant
everly
troop
astley
poore
and
dyke
the
latter
being
nearly
as
large
a
farmer
as
myself
and
employing
a
great
number
of
labourers
it
never
entered
into
my
head
for
a
moment
that
i
should
be
objected
to
on
the
contrary
i
should
rather
have
expected
that
this
worthy
bench
of
justasses
would
have
been
pleased
with
the
opportunity
of
fixing
me
in
what
was
generally
considered
a
troublesome
and
harassing
office
one
which
in
such
a
large
parish
would
require
a
considerable
portion
of
a
man
time
to
execute
it
properly
even
when
there
was
least
to
be
done
it
occupied
three
or
four
hours
every
other
sunday
to
attend
in
the
vestry
room
at
the
pay
table
to
hear
the
complaints
and
to
relieve
the
wants
of
those
who
were
in
distress
this
i
had
never
neglected
nor
left
as
others
had
frequently
done
to
the
care
of
servants
the
parish
books
were
returned
from
the
justices
and
lo
and
behold
my
name
was
passed
over
and
a
little
apron
farmer
was
appointed
in
my
stead
at
the
first
view
of
the
case
i
felt
a
weighty
responsibility
and
trouble
taken
as
it
were
off
my
shoulders
and
i
was
as
i
conceived
released
from
a
great
deal
of
labour
which
i
had
anticipated
and
i
heartily
despised
the
petty
malice
the
little
dirty
insult
intended
me
by
the
magistrates
who
in
their
desire
to
annoy
me
had
in
fact
rendered
me
a
great
service
on
my
speaking
of
it
in
this
way
to
my
old
housekeeper
who
first
brought
me
the
news
she
archly
addressed
me
as
follows
ah
sir
i
know
your
heart
too
well
to
believe
that
this
will
save
you
any
trouble
though
you
are
not
in
office
yet
as
you
pay
so
much
towards
the
relief
of
the
poor
and
feel
so
much
for
them
you
will
not
desert
them
you
will
i
am
sure
still
attend
the
pay
table
and
see
justice
done
them
at
any
rate
this
was
quite
enough
for
me
while
she
was
speaking
a
thousand
ideas
crowded
my
imagination
and
like
lightening
i
resolved
to
put
them
into
execution
i
said
nothing
but
the
next
sunday
after
the
service
of
the
day
was
over
i
attended
the
pay
table
as
i
had
constantly
done
while
i
held
the
office
it
was
so
unusual
for
any
one
to
attend
but
the
two
overseers
that
it
was
instantly
noticed
by
the
poor
who
were
in
waiting
i
sat
silent
but
that
was
quite
enough
every
one
was
paid
the
same
as
they
had
been
the
week
before
when
i
was
the
paymaster
though
i
knew
that
it
had
been
agreed
upon
to
dock
them
there
was
scarcely
a
single
servant
of
my
own
whose
name
was
upon
the
books
for
my
wish
was
that
they
should
always
earn
sufficient
by
their
labour
to
support
their
families
without
going
to
the
parish
while
i
was
in
office
myself
i
acted
on
this
system
without
making
any
remonstrance
with
those
farmers
who
paid
their
labourers
about
half
price
and
sent
them
to
the
parish
for
the
remaining
sum
which
was
required
for
their
support
but
i
now
made
up
my
mind
not
to
bear
this
grievance
any
longer
without
an
effort
to
remove
it
i
therefore
got
the
overseers
to
call
a
special
meeting
at
the
vestry
to
take
these
matters
into
consideration
at
this
meeting
i
proposed
that
every
farmer
in
the
parish
should
raise
his
servants
wages
to
enable
them
to
keep
their
families
at
any
rate
those
who
were
able
bodied
men
there
was
scarcely
any
objection
made
to
this
and
it
was
carried
unanimously
but
i
soon
found
that
this
measure
was
eluded
and
of
course
would
not
answer
several
of
the
farmers
turned
off
half
their
servants
and
others
all
of
them
and
hired
servants
out
of
the
parish
whom
they
could
procure
for
less
wages
i
however
always
persisted
in
engaging
my
servants
to
earn
enough
to
keep
themselves
and
families
without
going
to
the
parish
which
most
of
them
did
till
all
sorts
of
provisions
were
risen
to
double
if
not
treble
their
usual
price
one
thing
i
shall
here
which
is
the
fact
that
i
continued
for
nine
years
afterwards
to
occupy
a
very
great
portion
of
the
parish
and
consequently
to
pay
a
great
portion
of
the
parish
rates
but
though
my
name
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
list
and
sent
in
to
the
every
easter
during
that
time
yet
i
was
never
appointed
overseer
of
the
and
this
because
i
had
set
an
example
of
too
great
liberality
towards
them
when
i
was
in
office
notwithstanding
this
i
never
failed
to
advocate
and
with
success
the
cause
of
the
aged
the
infirm
the
widow
and
the
orphan
not
only
in
my
own
parishes
but
also
in
those
surrounding
me
and
every
act
of
oppression
that
was
practised
in
the
district
where
i
lived
was
always
communicated
to
me
and
as
far
as
i
had
it
in
my
power
i
obtained
redress
for
the
oppressed
i
very
soon
therefore
became
an
object
of
suspicion
and
dread
amongst
the
petty
tyrants
of
that
district
and
by
them
i
was
denominated
a
busy
meddling
fellow
but
as
a
set
off
to
this
i
received
the
thanks
the
blessings
of
the
poor
and
the
love
of
my
servants
whom
i
looked
upon
as
my
friends
and
neighbours
i
had
as
much
work
done
for
my
money
as
any
man
i
paid
my
servants
well
but
i
did
what
was
of
much
more
consequence
to
my
interest
i
treated
them
with
kindness
and
addressed
them
as
and
instead
of
doing
as
many
did
and
which
is
unhappily
much
too
frequently
the
practice
to
treat
labourers
and
servants
as
if
they
were
brutes
and
slaves
by
these
means
i
managed
a
very
large
business
with
the
greatest
ease
imaginable
my
servants
looked
up
to
me
as
a
friend
and
protector
as
one
who
was
at
all
times
ready
to
stand
forward
to
shield
them
from
any
oppression
and
on
the
other
hand
i
placed
the
greatest
confidence
in
them
to
guard
my
property
and
my
interest
i
was
seldom
deceived
for
i
not
only
found
them
faithful
at
that
time
but
they
are
grateful
even
to
this
day
all
this
i
attribute
solely
to
my
always
treating
them
with
kindness
and
no
part
of
their
affection
did
i
ever
obtain
by
any
unfair
or
surreptitious
means
i
never
encouraged
indolence
idleness
or
profligacy
of
any
sort
and
an
habitual
drunkard
i
never
kept
in
my
service
contrary
to
my
father
advice
i
still
continued
in
the
marlborough
troop
of
yeomanry
cavalry
his
last
words
were
however
quite
prophetic
as
to
the
danger
that
i
was
in
by
remaining
amongst
a
set
of
men
whose
notions
were
so
very
far
from
being
actuated
by
a
pure
love
of
country
still
as
the
threat
of
invasion
continued
to
be
held
up
to
the
country
as
likely
to
be
executed
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
quit
their
ranks
i
felt
an
ardour
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
meet
a
foreign
foe
if
ever
they
dared
to
invade
us
and
i
therefore
continued
to
join
the
troop
as
often
as
it
was
convenient
and
as
i
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
my
duty
and
resolved
to
perform
it
i
was
never
once
fined
for
any
breach
of
the
rules
or
regulations
which
were
made
and
agreed
to
for
the
guidance
of
the
members
of
the
troop
and
i
was
upon
particular
good
terms
with
the
commander
of
it
lord
bruce
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
aylesbury
who
always
treated
me
with
polite
attention
the
officers
of
the
everly
troop
of
yeomanry
had
as
they
thought
offered
me
an
insult
and
one
which
i
had
no
power
to
resent
they
were
his
majesty
justices
of
the
peace
and
if
they
chose
to
mix
up
their
revenge
with
their
duty
of
conservators
of
the
peace
i
had
no
power
to
prevent
it
nor
as
they
kept
their
own
council
could
i
ever
remonstrate
aware
as
i
was
of
the
insult
intended
by
their
passing
over
my
name
yet
as
i
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
office
and
had
taken
such
a
course
as
would
enable
me
to
protect
the
poor
from
any
partial
or
unjust
treatment
and
as
i
still
was
appointed
the
vicar
churchwarden
i
felt
little
or
no
resentment
on
that
account
i
had
expected
neither
candour
liberality
nor
from
them
and
they
had
not
disappointed
me
i
was
therefore
quite
indifferent
on
that
score
but
as
my
father
always
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
something
would
turn
out
unpleasant
to
me
before
i
got
quit
of
the
volunteer
service
i
was
exceedingly
guarded
in
all
my
movements
in
the
marlborough
troop
and
was
particularly
careful
never
to
omit
any
part
of
my
duty
or
to
do
any
thing
in
violation
of
the
rules
or
regulations
and
i
believe
that
i
was
almost
the
only
man
in
the
troop
that
had
not
been
fined
over
and
over
again
in
fact
as
the
fines
were
very
moderate
for
instance
i
believe
it
was
only
half
a
crown
for
being
absent
from
the
field
days
and
not
even
that
if
there
were
a
reasonable
excuse
for
they
did
not
inspire
the
members
with
much
dread
this
was
the
only
punishment
for
in
the
midst
of
all
my
fancied
security
a
circumstance
however
occurred
that
proved
all
my
father
prognostications
to
be
well
founded
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
that
i
was
become
an
expert
sportsman
and
agreeable
to
my
usual
enthusiasm
in
all
that
i
undertook
he
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
was
also
become
what
is
called
a
good
shot
during
the
month
of
september
i
had
killed
one
hundred
and
twenty
brace
of
partridges
and
i
was
engaged
to
take
the
first
day
pheasant
shooting
on
the
first
of
october
with
my
friend
and
comrade
thos
hancock
the
banker
of
marlborough
lord
aylesbury
the
proprietor
of
marlborough
forest
possessed
very
extensive
estates
and
large
manors
round
this
district
almost
the
whole
of
which
he
made
large
of
game
but
as
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
keep
his
tools
the
members
of
the
corporation
of
his
rottenest
of
rotten
close
boroughs
marlborough
in
good
humour
he
allotted
one
small
manor
at
a
distance
of
several
miles
from
his
principal
preserve
where
all
his
tenants
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
marlborough
and
their
friends
were
allowed
to
shoot
and
sport
without
interruption
whenever
they
pleased
to
this
place
my
friend
hancock
had
promised
to
take
me
for
a
day
sport
he
himself
being
as
will
presently
appear
a
very
poor
shot
i
went
to
hancock
to
sleep
the
night
previously
and
like
a
true
and
keen
sportsman
i
was
up
and
dressed
eager
for
the
sport
before
it
was
in
fact
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
be
early
as
there
was
a
host
of
cockney
and
other
sportsmen
who
always
sallied
forth
from
marlborough
on
that
day
and
as
the
manor
was
not
large
the
ground
was
generally
pretty
thickly
occupied
before
sun
rise
on
the
first
of
october
for
it
will
be
recollected
that
on
these
gala
days
tag
rag
and
bobtail
all
had
leave
whether
they
were
qualified
or
not
and
all
who
professed
to
be
sportsmen
hurried
there
whether
they
had
certificates
or
not
my
friend
and
myself
attended
by
our
servants
mounted
our
horses
and
as
we
rode
along
we
passed
two
or
three
parties
who
were
on
foot
and
who
had
got
the
start
of
us
but
we
soon
reached
farmer
edward
vezey
of
grove
upon
whose
farm
we
intended
to
take
our
day
sport
as
we
had
ridden
a
distance
of
four
or
five
miles
the
sun
was
now
up
and
as
we
heard
several
shots
fired
we
put
up
our
horses
and
proceeded
immediately
to
the
field
being
too
eager
sportsmen
to
wait
to
take
the
breakfast
which
vezey
had
prepared
for
us
the
farmer
informed
us
that
the
game
was
very
plentiful
and
when
we
entered
the
first
stubble
field
we
saw
a
nide
of
fourteen
pheasants
run
into
the
hedge
row
this
was
a
fine
earnest
of
our
sport
and
as
i
had
never
before
been
a
shooting
where
they
were
so
plenty
i
expressed
great
anxiety
to
begin
the
slaughter
without
delay
the
farmer
however
checked
my
ardour
and
increased
my
surprise
when
he
told
me
that
he
had
ten
such
nides
upon
his
farm
the
sport
began
and
having
a
double
barrelled
gun
i
killed
a
brace
a
cock
and
a
hen
my
friend
and
the
farmer
both
missed
the
latter
requested
me
not
to
kill
hens
as
he
would
procure
me
plenty
of
shots
at
cocks
we
had
with
us
my
dogs
which
were
staunch
and
steady
and
they
were
now
pointing
again
i
brought
down
a
brace
of
cocks
with
another
double
shot
my
friends
both
missed
again
and
laughed
heartily
at
each
other
particularly
when
they
found
that
i
was
sure
to
kill
enough
for
all
the
party
as
we
proceeded
i
killed
a
leash
more
so
that
i
had
three
brace
and
a
half
out
of
the
first
nide
of
fourteen
several
of
the
others
had
been
marked
down
and
the
farmer
said
we
were
sure
to
find
them
all
again
but
i
proposed
to
look
for
fresh
birds
instead
of
following
those
which
had
escaped
this
was
agreed
to
and
at
the
further
end
of
the
very
next
field
which
we
entered
we
discovered
another
set
running
into
the
hedge
row
when
ten
arrived
i
proposed
a
cessation
of
hostilities
that
we
might
retire
and
take
some
breakfast
for
i
declared
that
i
was
ashamed
to
kill
any
more
i
had
had
twenty
shots
and
had
bagged
nine
brace
and
a
half
of
cocks
and
one
hen
pheasant
having
been
lucky
enough
as
my
dogs
brought
all
their
game
to
save
every
bird
without
a
feather
being
scarcely
rumpled
my
friends
had
thirty
shots
between
them
and
had
killed
one
bird
in
fact
they
were
altogether
as
bad
shots
as
i
was
a
good
though
during
the
whole
time
we
had
not
been
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
yet
i
believe
that
while
i
was
out
i
heard
at
least
a
hundred
shots
fired
so
thickly
were
we
surrounded
with
the
rotten
borough
sportsmen
and
their
friends
after
this
we
returned
to
the
farmer
house
where
vezey
had
provided
an
excellent
breakfast
not
only
for
us
but
for
my
dogs
which
were
caressed
as
prodigies
and
the
game
consisting
of
ten
brace
of
cock
pheasants
and
a
hen
was
spread
in
triumph
on
the
floor
having
enjoyed
such
a
breakfast
as
keen
sportsmen
are
accustomed
to
take
in
the
course
of
which
we
talked
over
the
feats
of
the
morning
and
bestowed
many
well
earned
encomiums
upon
the
staunchness
and
sagacity
of
my
dogs
my
friends
proposed
to
start
again
for
the
field
till
dinner
time
i
however
positively
refused
to
budge
an
inch
declaring
that
i
would
not
fire
another
shot
that
day
i
was
i
told
them
more
than
content
with
having
killed
ten
brace
of
pheasants
in
one
day
and
therefore
i
would
remain
at
home
with
vezey
till
they
returned
they
tried
hard
to
prevail
upon
me
to
accompany
them
but
i
resisted
their
entreaties
they
then
endeavoured
to
rally
me
out
of
my
plan
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
go
out
again
and
consequently
all
their
bantering
was
of
no
avail
i
was
not
to
be
moved
even
by
the
good
humoured
jokes
of
the
farmer
about
my
remaining
alone
with
his
wife
and
finding
me
to
be
immoveable
they
set
out
by
themselves
at
length
they
returned
bringing
with
them
one
solitary
pheasant
though
they
acknowledged
that
they
had
had
ten
shots
each
and
they
were
afterwards
candid
enough
to
confess
that
the
dogs
had
actually
caught
that
nothing
daunted
by
their
bad
shooting
after
they
had
dined
and
taken
a
sufficient
quantity
of
good
old
stingo
and
once
more
tried
in
vain
to
persuade
me
to
bear
them
company
they
sallied
forth
again
for
the
evening
sport
the
best
time
of
the
day
for
pheasant
shooting
about
eight
they
came
back
but
they
had
only
killed
another
pheasant
notwithstanding
they
assured
me
that
they
had
actually
seen
above
one
hundred
thus
had
these
two
sportsmen
only
killed
three
pheasants
in
the
whole
day
having
had
between
them
upwards
of
shots
while
i
had
killed
ten
brace
at
twenty
shots
in
about
three
hours
of
course
i
laughed
at
them
heartily
in
which
i
was
joined
most
sincerely
by
vezey
i
am
quite
certain
that
if
i
had
continued
in
the
field
and
followed
up
the
sport
as
my
friends
did
i
should
have
killed
pheasants
instead
of
and
that
too
without
having
made
them
appear
much
thinned
so
plentiful
was
the
game
in
that
country
after
spending
a
very
pleasant
evening
we
returned
to
marlborough
where
i
slept
with
my
friend
hancock
and
shot
my
way
home
the
next
day
having
previously
to
my
setting
out
divided
the
between
the
which
was
always
the
case
in
those
friendly
parties
where
i
made
one
of
the
number
this
account
has
i
dare
say
appeared
to
the
reader
to
be
a
digression
upon
a
trivial
subject
but
i
shall
now
show
him
that
the
seemingly
trifling
circumstance
which
i
have
been
narrating
led
to
a
very
important
event
of
my
life
about
four
or
five
days
after
this
i
received
a
letter
from
lord
bruce
merely
saying
that
my
services
were
no
longer
required
in
the
marlborough
troop
of
yeomanry
and
he
therefore
requested
that
i
would
return
my
and
by
the
bearer
i
wrote
a
brief
answer
to
say
that
i
was
astonished
at
his
communication
but
that
i
should
attend
on
the
next
for
an
explanation
and
that
i
should
not
fail
to
bring
my
arms
with
me
i
own
that
i
was
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
the
cause
of
this
unceremonious
and
laconic
epistle
of
his
lordship
and
i
conjured
up
a
hundred
imaginary
reasons
for
this
abrupt
dismissal
of
me
from
his
troop
of
yeomanry
i
had
been
in
it
for
many
months
i
had
never
been
once
or
received
the
slightest
reprimand
from
his
lordship
or
either
of
the
other
officers
nor
could
i
recollect
any
one
instance
in
which
i
had
either
failed
to
perform
or
neglected
my
duty
as
a
soldier
but
though
i
could
not
recollect
this
i
now
recollected
the
last
sad
foreboding
words
of
my
dying
father
i
only
wish
i
could
have
lived
to
see
you
well
out
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
on
the
following
day
came
a
letter
from
my
friend
hancock
the
banker
which
unriddled
the
mystery
he
informed
me
that
he
also
had
received
a
similar
communication
from
our
colonel
lord
bruce
that
he
knew
of
the
dismissal
which
had
been
sent
to
me
and
that
it
was
a
current
report
amongst
the
tools
of
lord
aylesbury
at
marlborough
that
we
were
dismissed
from
the
troop
because
we
had
shot
so
many
pheasants
on
the
first
of
october
upon
one
of
his
lordship
manors
what
i
meant
to
do
on
the
subject
he
was
he
said
desirous
to
know
as
he
should
like
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
me
at
the
same
time
vowing
vengeance
against
our
colonel
i
sent
him
a
copy
of
the
answer
which
i
had
written
to
his
lordship
and
apprised
him
that
i
would
be
at
his
house
early
on
the
morning
of
the
next
in
my
uniform
as
usual
to
accompany
him
to
the
place
of
exercise
the
day
arrived
and
we
rode
together
to
the
field
where
we
used
to
perform
our
evolutions
it
was
upon
one
of
the
plains
in
savernake
forest
about
half
a
mile
from
his
lordship
house
but
within
full
view
of
it
when
we
reached
the
ground
the
troop
was
assembling
and
fell
into
the
ranks
as
formerly
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
his
vassals
who
composed
a
great
portion
of
the
troop
and
who
had
heard
of
our
being
discharged
or
dismissed
or
in
plainer
terms
turned
out
of
the
troop
by
the
colonel
after
we
had
remained
a
little
time
one
of
his
lordship
came
to
reconnoitre
and
as
soon
as
he
discovered
us
in
the
ranks
he
retreated
to
carry
the
astounding
intelligence
to
his
patron
messages
now
passed
backwards
and
forwards
from
the
troop
to
his
lordship
house
for
nearly
an
hour
before
he
made
his
appearance
a
delay
which
had
never
before
occurred
the
cause
was
not
only
anticipated
by
hancock
and
myself
but
by
all
the
members
of
the
troop
and
just
as
i
was
proposing
to
march
to
his
lordship
since
he
did
not
appear
disposed
to
come
to
us
he
at
last
made
his
appearance
riding
on
his
charger
with
slow
and
solemn
pace
i
have
since
understood
that
during
this
delay
several
messages
passed
between
his
lordship
house
savernake
lodge
and
tottenham
park
the
seat
of
his
father
the
earl
of
aylesbury
before
i
proceed
it
may
not
perhaps
be
amiss
to
make
the
reader
acquainted
with
the
origin
of
this
business
it
turned
out
that
lord
bruce
had
been
induced
to
write
the
aforesaid
letters
to
me
and
hancock
at
the
earnest
suggestion
of
his
father
lord
aylesbury
who
had
prevailed
upon
him
much
against
his
own
inclination
and
better
judgment
to
turn
us
out
of
the
troop
though
he
had
no
other
complaint
to
make
against
me
but
that
i
was
too
good
a
shot
at
his
father
pheasants
and
consequently
a
very
unfit
person
to
oppose
the
french
in
case
of
an
invasion
his
lordship
saw
and
felt
the
difficulty
of
his
situation
and
for
a
long
time
he
held
out
against
the
entreaties
of
his
father
but
the
old
earl
was
inexorable
and
i
am
told
that
his
mandate
was
at
length
delivered
in
such
a
and
such
a
manner
that
his
son
did
not
feel
it
prudent
to
resist
any
longer
the
particulars
i
subsequently
learned
from
one
of
the
keepers
who
was
present
at
the
interview
when
the
earl
came
down
from
london
which
i
understand
he
did
on
purpose
some
envious
and
cringing
tool
of
his
lordship
having
heard
of
our
successful
day
sport
at
grove
on
the
first
of
october
wrote
up
to
him
an
exaggerated
account
of
it
stating
that
i
in
company
with
hancock
had
killed
an
immense
number
of
pheasants
upon
his
lordship
manors
but
at
the
same
time
this
worthy
intelligencer
took
care
not
to
state
where
and
upon
what
manor
we
had
been
sporting
the
old
earl
who
was
the
most
tenacious
perhaps
about
his
game
of
any
man
in
england
no
sooner
got
the
letter
than
he
came
post
from
town
in
a
great
passion
and
when
he
arrived
at
tottenham
he
immediately
summoned
all
his
keepers
to
demand
an
account
of
their
conduct
for
suffering
his
game
to
be
destroyed
in
such
a
way
it
was
in
vain
that
they
all
declared
that
we
had
not
been
into
or
near
any
of
his
preserves
that
we
had
only
been
shooting
upon
a
distant
manor
where
his
lordship
did
not
even
appoint
a
keeper
and
which
manor
he
had
expressly
appropriated
for
the
sport
of
the
people
of
of
marlborough
and
their
friends
this
was
all
to
no
purpose
he
would
hear
no
excuse
and
as
soon
as
he
found
that
we
were
in
his
son
troop
of
yeomanry
he
dispatched
a
messenger
for
him
in
the
mean
time
he
threw
himself
into
the
most
violent
fits
of
passion
with
the
keepers
so
much
so
that
he
was
frequently
obliged
to
retire
and
recruit
himself
by
reclining
upon
a
sofa
and
when
he
had
recovered
his
strength
a
little
he
returned
to
the
charge
again
with
redoubled
violence
the
keeper
who
was
my
informant
assured
me
that
several
times
they
were
fearful
or
more
correctly
speaking
expected
that
he
would
break
a
blood
vessel
by
giving
himself
up
to
such
unbounded
fury
it
seems
the
family
at
tottenham
did
not
know
of
the
precaution
that
is
used
upon
such
occasions
by
a
testy
old
baronet
of
this
county
who
does
not
live
a
hundred
miles
from
stoneaston
which
i
am
credibly
informed
is
as
follows
whenever
the
baronet
has
one
of
these
sudden
and
violent
paroxysms
of
passion
which
is
not
very
unfrequently
her
ladyship
prevails
upon
him
to
sit
down
while
she
pours
copious
libations
of
cold
water
over
his
head
as
the
only
means
of
cooling
his
blood
and
saving
him
from
the
rupture
of
a
blood
vessel
upon
the
brain
at
length
his
lordship
son
lord
bruce
arrived
and
the
same
scene
was
repeated
and
it
is
said
that
nothing
but
a
promise
from
the
gallant
colonel
of
the
wiltshire
regiment
of
yeomanry
that
he
would
immediately
write
to
me
and
hancock
and
dismiss
us
from
his
troop
would
pacify
the
old
earl
this
promise
was
performed
in
the
way
which
i
have
described
by
his
lordship
writing
to
each
of
us
to
say
that
he
had
no
further
occasion
for
our
services
but
now
to
return
to
the
troop
which
we
left
drawn
up
on
the
field
of
exercise
our
colonel
having
at
length
arrived
in
the
front
of
the
ranks
he
continued
to
direct
his
eyes
quite
to
the
opposite
flank
to
that
in
which
i
was
and
i
could
never
catch
his
eye
directed
even
askance
towards
me
after
a
considerable
delay
the
serjeant
pulled
out
the
with
which
he
proceeded
till
he
came
to
the
number
filled
by
my
name
he
passed
it
over
and
began
to
utter
the
name
of
the
next
man
but
the
name
was
scarcely
half
out
of
his
lips
when
i
put
spurs
to
my
charger
and
brushed
up
so
furiously
to
him
that
he
reined
back
several
paces
ere
he
stopped
which
he
had
scarcely
done
with
my
horse
head
almost
in
his
lap
before
i
sternly
demanded
by
whose
authority
he
had
passed
over
my
name
in
a
tremulous
voice
he
stammered
out
that
it
was
done
by
order
of
lord
bruce
i
wheeled
my
horse
suddenly
round
and
his
head
coming
across
the
serjeant
breast
nearly
unhorsed
him
i
then
rode
briskly
up
to
lord
bruce
who
reined
his
charger
back
also
i
saluted
him
as
my
officer
and
firmly
demanded
by
what
authority
or
for
what
cause
he
had
given
orders
to
have
my
name
struck
out
of
the
conscious
of
being
about
to
persist
in
a
dishonourable
and
unworthy
act
after
hesitating
a
little
he
said
pray
sir
did
you
not
receive
a
letter
from
me
i
hastily
answered
yes
and
i
am
here
to
demand
in
person
an
explanation
and
to
know
what
charge
you
have
to
make
against
me
either
as
a
soldier
or
a
gentleman
he
now
seemed
still
more
confused
and
he
looked
everywhere
except
in
my
face
he
then
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
troop
as
much
as
to
say
will
you
not
protect
me
will
you
not
assist
to
get
me
out
of
this
dilemma
but
all
was
as
silent
as
the
grave
and
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
at
length
he
mustered
courage
to
say
i
make
no
charge
against
you
neither
do
i
feel
myself
called
upon
to
give
you
any
reason
for
my
conduct
i
i
as
commanding
officer
of
this
regiment
have
a
right
to
receive
any
man
into
it
or
to
dismiss
any
man
from
it
without
assigning
any
reason
for
my
so
doing
this
was
a
critical
moment
of
my
life
it
is
in
vain
now
to
lament
my
want
of
discretion
i
was
young
i
was
devoted
to
the
service
of
my
country
i
was
a
soldier
i
was
insulted
without
the
shadow
of
a
pretext
to
justify
the
insult
i
was
wounded
in
the
most
tender
part
my
patriotic
zeal
at
such
a
moment
i
could
take
no
counsel
of
cold
calculating
prudence
i
sternly
replied
then
my
lord
you
are
no
longer
my
officer
you
have
offered
me
a
deliberate
insult
which
it
seems
you
are
not
prepared
to
explain
or
apologise
for
i
therefore
demand
that
satisfaction
which
is
due
from
one
gentleman
to
another
and
mark
me
well
unless
you
give
me
that
satisfaction
i
will
post
you
as
a
coward
upon
which
i
took
my
pistols
from
the
holsters
and
was
taking
my
sword
from
the
belt
in
order
to
cast
them
with
defiance
at
his
horse
feet
these
arms
being
the
only
thing
that
i
possessed
belonging
to
the
government
expecting
perhaps
that
i
was
going
to
make
use
of
them
in
a
different
way
his
lordship
wheeled
suddenly
round
and
clapping
spurs
to
his
charger
he
was
without
once
looking
behind
him
soon
out
of
sight
he
having
wheeled
into
the
gateway
of
savernake
lodge
his
lordship
residence
while
this
was
passing
i
had
hurled
the
sword
and
the
brace
of
pistols
upon
the
ground
and
my
friend
hancock
had
moved
out
of
the
ranks
and
come
up
to
me
as
long
as
our
gallant
commander
was
visible
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
when
on
his
disappearance
i
looked
round
i
found
the
whole
troop
staring
with
astonishment
which
when
they
had
recovered
from
a
little
was
followed
by
a
general
laugh
my
friend
hancock
was
talking
loud
and
in
rather
a
coarse
way
which
i
checked
and
then
riding
up
to
the
centre
in
the
front
of
the
troop
i
addressed
my
comrades
something
in
the
following
strain
gentlemen
you
have
lost
your
commander
you
have
seen
and
heard
the
cause
as
however
a
troop
without
a
commander
is
like
a
ship
without
a
sail
or
a
rudder
i
for
once
will
give
the
word
to
the
right
wheel
dismiss
every
man
to
his
quarters
upon
this
every
man
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
and
i
returned
to
marlborough
to
dine
and
spend
the
evening
with
my
friend
hancock
if
i
had
paid
more
regard
to
prudence
and
not
acted
with
such
precipitation
i
should
have
put
this
lord
so
much
in
the
wrong
that
he
would
have
had
no
small
difficulty
in
satisfactorily
accounting
for
his
unwarrantable
conduct
for
without
much
vanity
i
may
say
that
there
was
not
a
better
soldier
in
the
regiment
a
man
more
devoted
to
the
service
of
his
country
and
very
few
indeed
if
any
who
would
have
so
greatly
dared
in
opposing
its
enemies
with
his
fortune
and
his
life
the
affair
as
it
was
quite
natural
that
it
should
soon
got
wind
throughout
the
county
and
particularly
amongst
the
members
of
the
various
corps
the
ten
troops
of
yeomanry
his
lordship
however
did
not
choose
to
meet
me
but
rather
preferred
to
settle
the
point
in
the
courts
of
law
in
the
following
term
a
criminal
information
was
filed
against
me
for
challenging
the
noble
lord
and
gallant
colonel
to
fight
a
duel
as
i
could
not
deny
the
fact
i
suffered
judgment
to
go
by
default
rather
than
try
the
question
in
the
court
at
salisbury
my
counsel
garrow
and
burrough
the
present
judges
having
informed
me
that
it
was
useless
to
defend
it
as
i
could
not
plead
the
provocation
however
great
with
any
chance
of
obtaining
a
verdict
but
they
were
of
opinion
that
when
the
affidavits
on
both
sides
came
to
be
read
the
court
would
never
call
me
up
for
judgment
in
this
conclusion
they
were
incorrect
but
it
is
not
wonderful
that
such
a
conclusion
should
have
been
drawn
by
them
for
the
late
lord
kenyon
expressed
a
very
great
unwillingness
to
proceed
and
term
after
term
he
intimated
to
my
counsel
that
he
hoped
i
had
seen
my
error
and
that
i
would
make
an
apology
to
his
lordship
which
would
save
the
court
the
trouble
of
taking
any
further
steps
in
the
affair
my
counsel
answered
that
they
were
not
instructed
to
say
whether
i
would
do
this
or
not
his
lordship
then
stated
that
in
case
i
did
so
before
the
next
term
he
understood
that
the
other
party
would
not
press
for
judgment
and
erskine
and
vicary
gibbs
who
were
employed
against
me
added
that
so
far
from
wishing
to
degrade
me
they
did
not
even
wish
that
i
should
make
any
personal
apology
to
his
lordship
if
my
counsel
would
say
for
me
that
i
admitted
the
offence
against
the
law
and
regretted
the
uneasiness
that
i
had
given
to
his
lordship
there
should
be
an
end
to
the
business
this
offer
lord
kenyon
strongly
urged
my
counsel
to
accept
burrough
who
was
junior
counsel
said
that
he
knew
my
feelings
upon
the
subject
so
well
that
he
would
undertake
although
in
my
absence
to
say
that
i
was
perfectly
sensible
that
i
had
been
provoked
to
offend
the
laws
of
my
country
and
that
he
was
ready
to
make
the
most
ample
apology
to
those
offended
laws
but
that
as
i
considered
lord
bruce
to
be
the
aggressor
he
could
not
on
my
part
undertake
to
make
any
apology
to
him
and
he
was
fearful
that
i
should
never
be
persuaded
to
do
it
though
he
would
communicate
the
wish
of
his
lordship
and
the
court
upon
the
subject
this
affair
had
now
been
before
the
court
four
or
five
terms
and
had
been
as
often
put
off
by
lord
kenyon
in
the
mean
time
the
affair
created
a
considerable
sensation
amongst
all
the
yeomanry
corps
in
the
kingdom
and
in
none
more
than
in
the
different
troops
of
the
wiltshire
yeomanry
and
the
conduct
of
their
colonel
was
canvassed
very
freely
every
gentleman
in
the
regiment
and
in
fact
every
member
of
the
whole
of
the
volunteer
force
of
the
country
felt
that
it
was
a
common
cause
as
he
might
be
placed
in
a
similar
situation
and
consequently
if
i
were
punished
he
himself
might
be
liable
to
arbitrary
and
unjust
dismissal
by
a
superior
officer
the
court
felt
and
knew
this
many
very
many
members
of
the
wilts
regiments
declared
that
they
would
immediately
resign
if
i
were
sentenced
to
any
fine
or
imprisonment
and
several
of
my
particular
friends
and
acquaintances
never
failed
to
they
keep
up
my
spirits
by
volunteering
this
declaration
as
often
as
i
met
them
wm
tinker
of
lavington
with
whom
i
was
particularly
intimate
and
my
friend
wm
butcher
of
erchfont
both
unequivocally
declared
that
they
would
not
remain
in
the
regiment
another
moment
after
i
had
received
any
sentence
the
next
term
came
and
when
my
counsel
were
again
called
upon
to
know
whether
they
were
instructed
to
make
the
necessary
apology
the
answer
was
that
i
was
sorry
for
having
violated
the
laws
of
my
country
but
that
the
illegal
and
unjustifiable
provocation
given
by
lord
bruce
was
such
that
i
had
declined
to
make
any
submission
whatever
to
his
lordship
lord
kenyon
begged
garrow
to
do
his
duty
by
his
client
and
make
it
for
me
and
now
lord
erskine
also
begged
his
friend
garrow
to
do
it
declaring
he
would
accept
the
slightest
acknowledgment
made
in
his
garrow
own
way
that
he
felt
for
me
and
did
by
no
means
wish
to
degrade
me
in
the
slightest
degree
garrow
rose
and
in
a
spirited
manner
said
that
he
thought
i
had
offered
quite
a
sufficient
apology
to
the
offended
laws
of
my
country
and
that
he
for
one
did
not
feel
that
under
all
the
circumstances
lord
bruce
was
entitled
to
any
apology
whatever
if
hunt
had
felt
disposed
of
his
own
accord
to
suffer
him
to
say
that
he
was
sorry
for
having
challenged
his
lordship
he
would
have
done
it
with
all
his
heart
without
believing
that
the
slightest
stigma
would
have
been
fixed
upon
that
gentleman
character
either
as
a
soldier
or
a
gentleman
but
hunt
had
a
right
to
have
his
own
feelings
upon
the
subject
and
he
could
not
blame
him
and
so
far
from
making
any
apology
for
hunt
in
his
absence
without
his
consent
he
as
his
counsel
with
all
the
respect
which
he
entertained
for
the
court
yet
would
not
take
upon
himself
to
advise
him
to
do
it
against
his
inclination
erskine
appeared
to
assent
to
this
but
vicary
gibbs
jumped
up
and
with
great
petulance
said
well
then
my
lord
we
demand
that
he
may
be
brought
up
we
pray
the
judgment
of
the
court
lord
kenyon
said
it
must
be
so
then
and
he
fixed
a
day
in
the
following
michaelmas
term
for
me
to
attend
to
receive
judgment
as
this
will
bring
me
to
a
very
important
epoch
in
my
life
i
shall
pass
over
briefly
several
minor
occurrences
that
would
have
been
considered
as
great
events
in
the
history
of
many
persons
who
have
written
an
account
of
their
own
lives
i
shall
however
slightly
touch
upon
one
or
two
circumstances
which
within
the
last
month
have
been
brought
to
my
recollection
in
the
following
rather
extraordinary
way
a
lady
travelling
from
london
to
bath
in
her
road
to
ilchester
accompanied
by
the
gaoler
of
that
place
was
questioned
by
a
fellow
passenger
a
gentleman
how
far
they
were
travelling
westward
the
gaoler
naturally
enough
wishing
to
disguise
his
name
and
occupation
answered
i
am
going
to
bath
sir
and
that
lady
is
going
on
to
ilchester
the
word
ilchester
was
no
sooner
pronounced
than
his
hearer
turned
to
the
lady
and
said
ah
that
is
where
hunt
is
confined
and
treated
with
so
much
severity
perhaps
you
will
see
him
madam
she
replied
that
it
was
possible
as
she
had
some
slight
knowledge
of
me
and
in
return
she
wished
to
be
informed
if
he
knew
me
he
replied
that
he
knew
me
very
well
and
had
known
me
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
and
that
he
also
knew
my
father
and
all
my
relations
as
well
as
hunt
and
her
relations
this
naturally
enough
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
lady
who
knew
me
personally
only
and
who
was
sure
to
see
me
as
she
was
coming
to
visit
a
gentleman
at
the
gaol
and
as
for
the
gaoler
any
information
that
he
could
get
about
my
private
affairs
and
my
family
would
be
a
great
treat
he
having
no
knowledge
of
me
except
as
a
public
character
his
curiosity
was
consequently
whetted
to
a
very
keen
edge
and
my
readers
will
not
have
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
during
the
remainder
of
the
journey
hunt
was
a
subject
of
conversation
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
the
actions
of
my
life
were
canvassed
with
great
freedom
and
some
earnestness
this
to
them
unknown
gentleman
was
charles
gordon
grey
esq
of
tracey
park
near
bath
who
was
as
communicative
as
our
passengers
could
wish
and
the
lady
as
well
as
the
gaoler
curiosity
was
gratified
almost
to
satiety
the
lady
has
however
candidly
confessed
to
me
that
although
grey
was
a
great
political
opponent
of
mine
yet
altogether
his
account
of
me
had
prejudiced
her
in
my
favour
and
she
has
related
to
me
many
anecdotes
of
my
life
that
had
totally
escaped
my
recollection
one
of
them
was
as
follows
of
which
i
believe
grey
was
an
and
therefore
could
speak
to
it
with
perfect
accuracy
i
was
as
i
have
already
informed
my
readers
always
an
enthusiast
in
any
thing
i
undertook
and
in
nothing
more
so
than
as
a
hunter
one
day
at
the
end
of
a
very
severe
after
a
run
of
nearly
thirty
miles
the
hounds
pressed
the
beautiful
animal
so
close
that
they
caught
him
as
he
was
swimming
over
a
deep
part
of
the
river
avon
between
salisbury
and
stratford
myself
with
the
master
of
the
hounds
michael
hicks
beach
esq
of
netheravon
and
two
or
three
gentlemen
amongst
whom
was
perhaps
gordon
grey
were
up
with
the
hounds
at
the
time
and
we
were
all
very
much
distressed
to
see
the
noble
animal
which
was
a
large
red
deer
and
which
had
afforded
us
so
much
sport
becoming
a
prey
to
the
hounds
without
it
being
possible
for
us
to
save
him
beach
at
first
urged
the
to
attempt
it
but
he
declined
adding
that
as
he
could
not
swim
well
enough
to
encounter
so
many
difficulties
as
he
should
meet
with
the
hounds
would
certainly
drown
him
as
well
as
the
stag
if
he
were
once
to
venture
into
the
deep
water
while
every
one
was
lamenting
in
vain
the
sad
fate
of
the
poor
animal
which
appeared
nearly
exhausted
as
the
hounds
had
repeatedly
pulled
him
under
the
water
i
had
slipped
on
one
side
hitched
my
horse
bridle
to
a
stake
in
the
hedge
and
stripped
in
before
the
rest
of
the
sportsmen
had
perceived
what
i
was
doing
i
sprang
to
the
river
brink
plunged
at
once
off
the
high
bank
into
the
midst
of
the
foaming
stream
and
swam
to
the
assistance
of
the
almost
expiring
stag
the
moment
that
i
dashed
head
foremost
into
the
stream
the
remainder
of
the
pack
which
had
not
before
ventured
into
the
watery
element
but
had
kept
yelping
and
baying
upon
the
banks
now
to
a
dog
leaped
in
after
me
none
but
those
who
were
of
this
scene
can
have
any
idea
of
the
danger
in
which
i
appeared
to
be
placed
many
of
the
hounds
that
had
been
worrying
the
stag
seeing
a
naked
man
rise
as
it
were
from
out
of
the
deep
for
i
had
been
obliged
to
dive
several
yards
to
break
my
fall
from
off
the
steep
bank
instantly
quitted
the
hold
they
had
on
the
stag
and
swam
towards
me
as
if
to
seize
upon
more
tempting
prey
my
fellow
sportsmen
who
had
scarcely
recovered
from
their
astonishment
at
seeing
me
unexpectedly
plunge
into
the
water
and
who
now
apprehended
my
inevitable
destruction
by
the
hounds
seizing
upon
me
gave
all
at
once
an
involuntary
scream
and
implored
me
to
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
but
having
once
made
up
my
mind
to
accomplish
an
object
the
word
was
not
in
my
vocabulary
nothing
daunted
i
swam
boldly
up
and
faced
the
approaching
pack
calling
each
hound
by
his
name
which
i
fortunately
knew
and
which
was
still
more
fortunate
my
voice
was
as
well
known
to
them
i
swam
and
fought
my
way
through
them
cheering
and
hallooing
to
them
as
if
in
the
chace
they
all
turned
and
continued
to
swim
with
me
again
up
to
the
poor
stag
with
the
exception
of
one
old
hound
who
unperceived
seized
fast
hold
of
me
by
the
thumb
of
the
right
hand
which
at
once
checked
my
progress
and
gave
me
great
pain
i
called
him
by
his
name
but
it
was
in
vain
for
he
held
fast
upon
which
with
considerable
effort
i
dragged
him
under
water
and
seizing
him
by
the
throat
with
the
other
hand
i
held
him
there
till
he
let
go
his
hold
during
this
struggle
we
both
disappeared
under
the
water
together
to
the
great
consternation
of
the
anxious
beholders
up
we
came
together
again
but
i
continued
to
grasp
him
firmly
with
my
left
hand
by
the
throat
and
i
for
a
short
time
exhibited
the
caitiff
in
this
state
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
tongue
out
to
shew
how
completely
i
had
subdued
him
i
gave
him
one
more
ducking
under
water
and
let
him
go
i
then
continued
my
course
without
further
interruption
towards
the
stag
who
had
meanwhile
drifted
twenty
or
thirty
yards
down
with
the
current
which
was
very
rapid
surrounded
by
every
hound
in
the
pack
couple
with
the
exception
of
poor
old
trojan
who
now
kept
at
a
very
respectful
distance
behind
us
we
soon
came
up
to
the
stag
but
now
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
task
commenced
now
the
tug
of
war
began
for
i
had
no
sooner
laid
my
hand
upon
the
poor
animal
than
the
whole
pack
began
their
attack
upon
him
with
redoubled
vigour
one
of
the
gentlemen
threw
me
his
whip
which
i
applied
to
the
backs
of
the
dogs
with
one
hand
while
i
held
the
stag
with
the
other
this
however
had
little
or
no
effect
they
were
too
much
accustomed
to
the
lash
to
be
driven
from
their
game
in
this
way
one
of
my
friends
therefore
called
out
to
me
to
take
the
other
end
which
i
did
and
laid
on
about
their
heads
and
ears
lustily
still
i
found
that
they
would
not
let
go
their
holds
without
i
almost
beat
out
their
brains
and
i
was
consequently
obliged
to
take
another
course
which
was
this
the
first
hound
that
i
came
near
to
i
grasped
by
the
throat
till
he
let
go
and
in
this
state
with
his
mouth
still
open
i
held
him
a
short
time
under
water
this
mode
of
proceeding
had
the
desired
effect
and
i
continued
it
with
every
hound
till
i
set
the
poor
animal
perfectly
free
by
this
time
i
was
almost
exhausted
myself
for
i
had
been
in
the
water
at
least
twenty
minutes
and
that
too
at
the
end
of
a
very
severe
chace
in
a
cold
day
in
february
my
friends
on
the
bank
kept
giving
their
advice
and
amongst
the
number
was
tom
the
who
had
refused
to
venture
into
the
water
and
as
a
punishment
for
his
cowardice
i
requested
my
friends
either
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
or
throw
him
in
and
give
him
a
ducking
in
the
midst
of
all
this
i
recollect
to
have
hailed
the
huntsman
and
desired
him
to
take
my
clothes
off
the
wet
meadow
and
to
lead
my
favourite
mare
about
to
keep
her
from
taking
cold
some
of
my
readers
will
wonder
how
i
could
be
so
much
at
my
ease
under
such
circumstances
and
particularly
as
i
have
said
i
was
nearly
exhausted
this
i
shall
easily
explain
the
hounds
being
all
checked
off
the
stag
poor
fellow
lay
most
patiently
floating
upon
the
stream
and
as
i
had
now
taken
him
round
his
neck
i
supported
myself
with
great
ease
and
gained
strength
to
swim
with
one
hand
while
i
held
him
with
the
other
till
i
arrived
at
the
opposite
bank
where
my
brother
sportsmen
were
waiting
with
the
greatest
anxiety
to
assist
in
taking
him
out
of
the
water
but
as
the
water
was
nearly
ten
feet
deep
i
of
course
could
gain
no
footing
and
as
the
bank
was
four
feet
above
the
river
those
on
the
outside
could
not
reach
him
i
contrived
however
to
fasten
the
thongs
of
their
whips
round
different
parts
of
his
body
so
that
they
were
enabled
at
length
with
great
difficulty
to
drag
him
safe
on
shore
without
the
poor
stag
having
received
any
material
injury
as
soon
as
this
was
accomplished
and
not
before
was
i
dragged
out
in
the
same
way
with
the
thongs
of
my
fellow
sportsmen
whips
i
was
certainly
so
exhausted
that
i
could
not
stand
without
holding
while
they
rubbed
me
dry
with
their
pocket
handkerchiefs
but
i
soon
recovered
and
having
put
on
my
clothes
i
mounted
my
favourite
chesnut
mare
mountebank
and
rode
with
my
friends
who
all
accompanied
me
to
the
inn
the
house
in
the
of
old
sarum
where
this
story
is
frequently
related
to
this
day
such
is
one
of
the
anecdotes
that
gordon
grey
related
of
me
and
which
circumstance
with
a
hundred
others
of
a
similar
nature
had
entirely
escaped
my
memory
and
would
never
have
been
related
here
had
it
not
been
for
the
journey
in
the
bath
stage
coach
although
the
mark
which
old
trojan
tooth
made
on
the
thumb
of
my
right
hand
is
always
present
to
my
view
particularly
when
i
am
writing
and
which
mark
i
observed
at
the
time
would
always
bring
the
event
to
my
recollection
as
i
should
carry
it
with
me
to
the
grave
that
i
shall
carry
it
there
is
certain
for
it
is
still
perfectly
visible
though
it
was
inflicted
years
ago
such
was
the
man
whom
lord
bruce
dismissed
from
the
marlborough
troop
of
yeomanry
as
unworthy
to
rank
amongst
those
who
had
volunteered
their
services
to
repel
the
invasion
of
a
powerful
menacing
foreign
foe
such
was
the
man
and
such
was
his
zeal
and
enthusiasm
such
his
devoted
patriotism
that
had
it
been
practicable
to
lay
a
mine
of
gunpowder
under
the
boulogne
flotilla
he
would
with
the
same
alacrity
as
he
now
rescued
the
stag
have
dashed
into
the
sea
with
a
lighted
torch
in
one
hand
while
he
swam
with
the
other
such
was
the
man
who
would
have
fearlessly
applied
the
torch
to
the
train
and
freely
have
blown
them
and
himself
together
into
the
air
to
have
saved
his
country
and
this
was
the
sort
of
man
that
lord
bruce
me
to
be
when
to
gratify
the
rage
of
his
father
he
undertook
to
dismiss
me
from
the
wiltshire
regiment
of
yeomanry
cavalry
because
i
had
forsooth
killed
ten
brace
of
pheasants
at
twenty
shots
well
the
day
at
length
arrived
for
my
attending
the
court
of
bench
to
stand
for
the
time
upon
its
floor
to
receive
judgment
justice
garrow
and
justice
burrough
were
my
counsel
and
the
former
made
an
eloquent
appeal
to
the
court
declaring
that
he
would
much
rather
be
placed
in
my
situation
than
that
of
the
noble
lord
and
winding
up
his
speech
with
a
high
eulogium
upon
my
character
he
said
that
if
he
lived
in
my
neighbourhood
i
should
be
the
first
man
that
he
would
seek
for
as
a
friend
the
present
lord
erskine
and
the
late
sir
vickery
gibbs
were
employed
to
pray
for
the
judgment
of
the
court
against
me
but
his
lordship
conducted
himself
with
the
greatest
moderation
and
even
kindness
towards
me
and
never
uttered
one
single
offensive
or
unkind
sentence
in
the
whole
of
his
eloquent
harangue
but
the
little
waspish
viper
gibbs
whose
malignant
vicious
and
countenance
was
always
the
index
of
his
little
mind
made
a
most
virulent
vindictive
and
cowardly
attack
upon
me
which
was
so
morose
and
unfeeling
and
so
uncalled
for
by
the
circumstances
that
if
i
had
not
been
held
back
by
any
attorney
i
should
certainly
have
inflicted
a
summary
and
a
just
chastisement
upon
him
upon
the
spot
by
dashing
back
his
lies
together
with
his
teeth
down
his
throat
i
was
however
restrained
and
sentence
was
passed
by
old
mumbling
grose
that
i
should
pay
one
hundred
pounds
to
the
king
and
be
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
marshal
of
the
court
for
six
weeks
there
sat
squatting
upon
the
bench
kenyon
chief
justice
grose
lawrence
and
le
blanc
all
four
of
them
gone
long
long
ago
to
receive
their
sentence
from
the
judge
of
another
and
a
higher
court
the
judge
of
judges
and
the
have
mercy
on
them
say
i
paid
the
fine
immediately
and
two
friends
who
were
in
court
entered
into
recognizances
in
five
hundred
pounds
each
and
myself
in
one
thousand
pounds
to
keep
the
peace
towards
this
gallant
lord
for
three
years
i
was
handed
over
to
a
tipstaff
who
very
civilly
conducted
me
and
my
friends
in
a
coach
to
the
king
bench
which
place
i
had
the
evening
before
been
to
reconnoitre
with
my
friend
wm
butcher
who
had
come
to
town
with
me
and
had
voluntarily
become
one
of
my
bail
my
friends
anticipated
that
i
should
be
committed
to
the
king
bench
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
offer
any
apology
to
lord
bruce
at
this
time
waddington
was
a
prisoner
in
the
king
bench
for
forestalling
hops
and
as
he
had
conducted
his
defence
before
the
court
with
great
energy
and
considerable
talent
and
as
he
was
convicted
upon
an
old
obsolete
statute
he
was
not
esteemed
guilty
of
any
moral
crime
i
had
imbibed
a
notion
that
the
debtors
in
the
prison
were
generally
a
set
of
swindlers
and
i
was
therefore
anxious
to
avoid
their
society
or
having
anything
to
do
with
them
which
feeling
however
erroneous
increased
my
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
waddington
the
chief
temptation
however
undoubtedly
was
his
being
a
man
who
had
become
celebrated
for
the
spirit
which
he
had
several
times
evinced
before
the
court
in
defending
himself
against
what
was
generally
considered
as
a
mere
political
prosecution
i
made
several
inquiries
about
him
but
i
only
learned
that
he
was
not
within
the
walls
and
that
he
had
apartments
over
the
lobby
without
the
gates
i
was
as
yet
too
great
a
novice
to
comprehend
what
was
meant
by
imprisonment
without
being
in
prison
i
arrived
at
the
prison
about
two
and
was
conducted
into
the
coffee
room
kept
by
davey
the
marshal
coachman
where
we
were
soon
accommodated
with
a
very
good
dinner
in
the
mean
time
i
had
made
the
necessary
inquiry
for
an
apartment
but
the
prison
was
represented
to
be
very
full
and
i
was
shewn
one
or
two
rooms
where
the
parties
occupying
them
had
no
objection
to
turn
out
to
accommodate
me
for
a
certain
stipulated
sum
amongst
the
number
i
was
shewn
up
into
a
very
good
room
which
was
occupied
by
a
lady
who
it
was
said
would
give
up
her
room
for
ten
pounds
when
we
entered
the
room
she
was
singing
very
divinely
she
being
no
less
a
personage
than
wells
the
celebrated
public
singer
with
great
freedom
she
inquired
which
was
the
gentleman
me
or
my
attorney
who
accompanied
me
and
upon
being
informed
that
i
was
the
prisoner
she
eyed
me
over
from
head
to
toe
and
then
with
that
art
of
which
she
was
so
much
a
mistress
she
simpering
said
that
she
was
loath
to
part
with
her
room
at
any
price
but
that
as
i
appeared
a
nice
wholesome
country
gentleman
i
should
be
welcome
to
half
of
it
without
paying
any
thing
as
i
was
not
prepared
to
enter
into
a
contract
of
that
sort
i
hastily
retired
and
left
my
attorney
to
settle
the
quantum
of
pecuniary
remuneration
with
her
we
dined
very
pleasantly
i
think
six
of
us
and
before
the
cloth
was
removed
i
had
a
visit
from
my
friend
the
rev
john
prince
the
chaplain
of
the
magdalen
and
vicar
of
the
parish
of
enford
whose
churchwarden
i
was
i
stated
to
him
the
difficulty
i
had
in
procuring
a
suitable
apartment
which
he
no
sooner
heard
than
he
volunteered
his
services
to
go
immediately
to
his
friend
and
neighbour
the
marshal
with
whom
he
had
no
doubt
he
should
readily
arrange
that
matter
for
me
to
my
satisfaction
i
was
much
pleased
to
have
such
an
advocate
as
mr
prince
a
man
so
well
known
and
so
much
esteemed
for
his
piety
and
goodness
of
heart
but
he
soon
returned
looking
very
grave
and
said
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
the
marshal
who
would
not
enter
into
any
conversation
with
him
upon
the
subject
but
told
him
that
if
hunt
wanted
any
thing
he
was
ready
to
do
whatever
lay
in
his
power
to
serve
him
but
that
his
attorney
was
the
proper
person
to
transact
such
business
and
that
it
was
quite
out
of
the
worthy
parson
line
my
attorney
bird
immediately
waited
upon
the
marshal
and
while
he
was
gone
mr
prince
informed
me
that
his
old
friend
jones
had
behaved
quite
rudely
to
him
and
expressed
himself
very
much
surprised
that
a
man
of
his
calling
should
think
of
interfering
in
such
matters
poor
prince
was
therefore
fully
impressed
with
an
idea
that
jones
would
do
nothing
to
accommodate
me
as
he
had
quite
huffed
him
in
ten
minutes
however
bird
returned
with
the
news
that
he
had
settled
every
thing
with
the
marshal
that
i
should
have
an
apartment
over
the
lobby
but
that
i
must
go
with
him
to
the
marshal
and
enter
into
security
not
to
escape
i
immediately
complied
and
as
we
went
along
he
informed
me
that
i
was
to
give
a
bond
for
five
thousand
pounds
not
to
escape
and
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
return
again
within
the
walls
this
i
readily
agreed
to
and
the
matter
was
settled
in
ten
minutes
i
was
to
have
the
room
over
the
front
lobby
and
the
run
of
the
key
i
returned
to
my
friends
elated
with
the
prospect
of
my
being
so
comfortable
as
i
had
been
very
much
disgusted
with
the
scenes
of
profligacy
and
drunkenness
that
i
had
already
witnessed
within
the
walls
filewood
the
principal
turnkey
wife
who
kept
the
lobby
was
to
prepare
my
bed
and
get
every
thing
ready
for
me
in
my
room
by
ten
the
time
at
which
my
friends
were
to
leave
the
prison
when
the
hour
arrived
i
was
shown
into
a
very
spacious
room
nicely
furnished
with
a
neat
bureau
bedstead
standing
in
one
corner
my
hostess
who
was
a
pretty
woman
was
very
communicative
and
so
attentive
that
i
really
felt
quite
as
comfortable
as
if
i
had
been
at
an
inn
it
was
in
fact
much
better
than
the
apartments
i
had
been
in
at
the
inn
in
london
the
black
lion
water
lane
there
was
a
good
fire
in
the
room
and
every
thing
bore
the
air
of
cleanliness
and
comfort
and
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
till
as
sound
and
as
well
as
i
ever
slept
in
my
life
as
i
lay
in
my
bed
thinking
of
the
new
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
i
lamented
that
i
had
not
overnight
made
some
inquiries
about
waddington
as
i
still
felt
very
anxious
to
become
acquainted
with
him
and
i
was
devising
all
sorts
of
schemes
how
i
could
gain
an
introduction
to
him
when
my
hostess
knocked
at
my
door
to
say
that
waddington
the
gentleman
who
lodged
in
the
room
over
me
sent
his
compliments
and
wished
that
i
would
favour
him
with
my
company
to
breakfast
which
he
would
have
ready
in
half
an
hour
time
this
was
to
me
a
most
gratifying
invitation
which
i
cheerfully
accepted
with
as
little
ceremony
as
it
was
made
having
dressed
myself
i
was
shown
into
his
room
which
was
immediately
over
mine
i
being
on
the
first
and
he
on
the
second
story
having
read
a
great
deal
about
him
in
the
papers
i
had
formed
to
myself
an
idea
of
waddington
but
instead
of
meeting
as
i
expected
a
tall
stout
athletic
person
i
found
him
rather
a
short
thin
gentleman
who
approached
me
quite
with
the
air
and
address
of
a
foreigner
he
however
received
me
very
politely
and
having
shaken
each
other
by
the
hand
we
had
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
expense
of
our
prosecutors
and
the
ridiculous
situation
in
which
we
were
placed
from
that
moment
all
reserve
was
laid
aside
between
us
and
before
we
had
finished
our
breakfast
we
agreed
to
mess
together
during
the
six
weeks
which
i
had
to
remain
he
being
sentenced
for
six
months
it
was
arranged
that
my
room
should
be
the
dining
and
his
the
and
whoever
might
visit
us
that
he
should
pay
the
expenses
of
the
first
day
and
i
of
the
next
and
so
on
alternately
we
had
our
meals
provided
by
davey
at
the
coffee
room
and
sent
to
us
and
we
settled
our
bill
of
the
preceding
day
every
morning
at
breakfast
without
once
having
deviated
from
this
plan
we
passed
our
time
for
the
six
weeks
in
the
most
profound
harmony
and
good
humour
with
each
other
never
having
had
the
slightest
disagreement
during
the
whole
of
the
period
that
we
were
together
i
soon
discovered
that
my
new
acquaintance
was
a
great
politician
and
that
he
was
a
decided
opposition
man
or
rather
a
democrat
a
sort
of
being
which
i
had
hitherto
been
taught
to
look
upon
if
not
with
an
evil
at
least
with
a
suspicious
eye
i
was
a
professed
loyal
man
but
before
we
had
been
together
four
and
twenty
hours
he
pronounced
me
to
be
a
real
democrat
without
my
being
aware
of
it
myself
i
found
him
a
cheerful
companion
who
whatever
i
might
think
of
his
political
feelings
and
information
was
at
any
rate
possessed
of
a
great
share
of
mercantile
knowledge
his
opinions
upon
political
matters
were
many
of
them
new
to
me
and
his
arguments
though
there
was
much
ingenuity
in
them
were
not
altogether
calculated
to
carry
conviction
to
the
mind
his
conversation
however
gave
me
an
insight
into
many
matters
that
i
had
never
before
had
an
opportunity
of
investigating
or
of
hearing
discussed
on
the
second
day
i
was
for
the
first
time
introduced
to
henry
clifford
the
barrister
who
was
one
of
waddington
counsel
and
who
came
to
dine
with
us
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
him
and
though
he
advocated
the
same
principles
that
were
professed
by
his
client
yet
he
did
it
in
such
a
way
and
in
such
plain
intelligible
language
that
every
word
every
sentence
carried
conviction
with
it
he
conversed
of
rational
liberty
of
freedom
as
the
natural
rights
of
man
and
as
the
law
of
god
and
nature
he
put
the
matter
clearly
and
distinctly
undisguised
by
sophistry
and
as
far
as
i
could
discover
by
his
discourse
i
had
already
an
inherent
love
of
that
liberty
of
which
he
spoke
i
was
naturally
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
freedom
and
an
implacable
foe
to
tyranny
and
oppression
and
this
i
admitted
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
i
disclaimed
any
participation
in
those
principles
which
were
designated
as
jacobinical
and
professed
myself
a
loyal
man
and
a
friend
to
my
king
and
country
with
the
greatest
clifford
smiled
at
my
folly
but
said
he
my
worthy
young
friend
and
i
am
proud
to
call
you
so
i
see
that
you
have
in
reality
imbibed
the
best
the
most
honourable
of
principles
the
seeds
of
genuine
patriotism
are
implanted
in
your
heart
it
only
requires
a
little
time
to
rear
them
into
maturity
and
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
but
they
will
ere
long
produce
good
and
useful
fruit
i
believe
you
are
a
really
loyal
man
a
sincere
friend
to
your
king
and
country
and
if
i
thought
you
were
not
our
acquaintance
i
assure
you
should
be
very
short
but
as
you
are
one
i
hope
our
friendship
will
only
cease
with
our
lives
i
shall
take
leave
to
say
that
this
wish
was
accomplished
to
the
very
letter
as
i
ever
afterwards
lived
in
the
most
friendly
habits
of
intimacy
with
him
till
the
time
of
his
decease
our
discourse
now
became
more
general
waddington
had
listened
with
great
attention
to
his
friend
clifford
clear
and
undisguised
manner
of
initiating
as
he
called
it
the
young
countryman
into
the
science
of
politics
and
he
appeared
much
delighted
to
find
that
the
bait
took
so
well
clifford
reproved
his
expression
and
added
that
the
young
countryman
as
he
was
pleased
to
term
me
required
nothing
more
than
a
little
practical
knowledge
of
corruption
to
make
him
shake
off
all
his
natural
prejudices
and
become
as
good
and
sincere
a
defender
of
liberty
as
either
of
them
by
this
time
our
friend
clifford
who
was
then
a
man
had
taken
his
glass
too
freely
to
make
himself
intelligible
any
longer
and
i
resisted
the
proposition
of
waddington
to
uncork
another
bottle
as
i
was
very
much
shocked
to
see
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
truly
able
men
in
the
country
reduced
to
a
mere
idiot
by
the
effect
of
wine
waddington
who
was
naturally
an
abstemious
man
agreed
with
me
and
as
we
had
previously
given
a
general
invitation
to
clifford
to
dine
with
us
twice
a
week
we
now
came
also
to
a
resolution
that
in
future
we
would
not
be
deprived
in
such
a
way
of
his
instructive
and
agreeable
society
to
accomplish
our
purpose
we
agreed
therefore
that
we
would
limit
the
quantity
of
wine
to
be
drank
when
he
was
at
our
table
and
that
as
soon
as
the
quantity
was
gone
coffee
or
tea
should
invariably
be
introduced
our
friend
and
guest
literally
reeled
down
stairs
when
he
took
leave
of
us
and
i
could
not
help
observing
what
a
misfortune
it
was
for
such
a
brilliant
man
to
drown
his
senses
and
obscure
his
intellect
with
wine
though
i
had
for
some
years
at
least
since
i
was
married
kept
that
sort
of
company
which
led
me
to
take
my
glass
freely
yet
i
seldom
took
it
to
excess
and
never
to
inebriate
myself
this
melancholy
example
of
clifford
had
a
very
great
effect
upon
me
to
see
a
man
of
the
most
brilliant
talent
of
the
most
profound
erudition
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
become
an
object
of
pity
and
contempt
imbecile
and
even
beastly
was
a
sight
which
made
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
and
i
began
to
think
that
my
own
partial
indulgence
in
the
practice
of
drinking
so
freely
after
dinner
was
an
act
of
great
weakness
and
folly
which
if
not
checked
was
likely
to
degenerate
into
one
of
the
worst
of
crimes
in
these
sentiments
my
friend
waddington
agreed
with
me
and
he
readily
joined
in
a
determination
never
to
suffer
any
thing
of
the
sort
to
take
place
at
our
table
again
while
we
remained
together
this
resolution
we
managed
to
keep
though
we
had
a
difficult
task
to
perform
when
clifford
and
the
rev
gabriel
dined
with
us
which
was
regularly
twice
a
week
the
reverend
doctor
in
particular
we
found
it
incumbent
upon
us
to
keep
within
strict
bounds
for
when
he
had
got
a
little
too
much
wine
though
he
was
an
old
man
and
a
dignitary
of
the
church
it
was
with
great
difficulty
we
could
restrain
him
from
indulging
in
obscene
conversation
with
which
my
friend
and
myself
were
equally
disgusted
the
doctor
was
a
wit
and
a
scholar
but
as
waddington
and
her
family
as
well
as
other
amiable
females
both
of
her
and
my
friends
frequently
visited
us
his
language
was
not
to
be
tolerated
and
consequently
i
undertook
one
morning
to
remonstrate
with
the
doctor
upon
the
subject
he
freely
acknowledged
his
error
but
attributed
it
to
a
foolish
habit
that
he
had
acquired
at
college
of
which
he
could
never
afterwards
wholly
break
himself
at
the
same
time
he
pleaded
that
he
never
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
disgrace
his
profession
unless
he
had
taken
too
much
wine
which
by
the
bye
was
every
day
when
he
could
get
it
i
made
known
to
the
doctor
our
resolution
to
limit
him
to
a
bottle
and
that
his
visits
were
to
be
continued
upon
that
understanding
to
this
he
readily
assented
and
thenceforth
we
found
him
to
be
a
and
entertaining
companion
on
the
two
days
in
the
week
that
he
was
invited
to
dine
with
us
the
doctor
was
reduced
in
circumstances
and
was
living
within
the
rules
it
was
he
who
built
the
octagon
chapel
at
bath
of
which
he
was
the
proprietor
and
where
he
preached
for
many
years
he
was
a
man
of
letters
and
when
sober
a
perfect
gentleman
but
when
ever
so
little
elevated
he
betrayed
even
to
us
comparative
strangers
that
he
was
a
complete
free
thinker
many
of
my
readers
will
recollect
the
literary
controversy
which
took
place
between
him
and
i
believe
doctor
gardiner
of
bath
i
forget
what
were
his
politics
but
i
believe
he
was
a
whig
one
thing
i
perfectly
recollect
which
was
that
when
he
was
going
to
relate
an
obscene
story
or
anecdote
he
always
gave
us
a
preliminary
intimation
of
it
by
he
was
on
the
whole
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
of
the
numerous
extraordinary
characters
that
i
became
acquainted
with
while
i
remained
at
the
king
bench
during
my
first
visit
there
of
six
weeks
in
the
years
and
this
was
a
very
distressing
season
for
the
poor
and
waddington
and
myself
gave
a
ton
of
potatoes
to
the
poor
prisoners
in
the
king
bench
every
week
nor
during
the
time
that
i
was
there
did
we
ever
fail
to
relieve
not
only
every
applicant
and
they
were
numerous
but
also
to
seek
privately
for
objects
of
distress
within
the
walls
and
wherever
we
found
an
unfortunate
object
we
did
our
best
to
alleviate
his
misery
some
we
found
almost
naked
without
clothes
or
even
bedding
some
who
were
pining
in
secret
silent
want
who
were
ashamed
to
make
their
wretchedness
known
these
we
never
failed
to
succour
the
marshal
likewise
assisted
us
in
these
acts
of
charity
and
did
every
thing
that
humanity
and
kindness
could
suggest
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
unhappy
prisoners
in
his
custody
it
being
now
the
season
when
those
who
toil
for
us
naturally
expect
some
proof
of
our
friendship
and
gratitude
to
enable
them
to
enjoy
their
long
anticipated
merriment
i
sent
home
directions
to
hunt
to
have
my
usual
christmas
present
given
to
each
of
my
servants
it
consisted
of
a
good
piece
of
beef
some
potatoes
and
faggots
to
dress
it
with
the
quantity
given
being
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
family
this
good
custom
i
learned
from
my
father
and
i
regularly
continued
it
every
year
but
it
was
always
done
i
hope
with
a
becoming
spirit
without
any
ostentation
i
never
as
many
did
caused
my
little
charitable
acts
to
be
blazoned
forth
in
the
public
newspapers
i
will
venture
to
say
that
while
we
were
in
the
king
bench
waddington
and
myself
gave
away
privately
a
larger
sum
in
comparison
with
our
incomes
than
any
of
the
publicly
blazoned
forth
charitable
men
in
the
city
of
london
who
were
lauded
up
to
the
sky
for
their
benevolent
disposition
every
christmas
each
servant
who
had
worked
for
me
during
the
year
received
a
present
of
beef
enough
to
keep
each
person
a
week
which
was
never
noticed
in
any
of
the
public
newspapers
though
they
constantly
teemed
with
pompous
accounts
of
the
and
of
my
more
opulent
neighbours
who
never
gave
half
so
much
in
fact
who
never
gave
a
twentieth
part
so
much
as
myself
in
proportion
to
their
means
a
circumstance
of
this
sort
which
happened
not
a
hundred
miles
from
this
place
and
the
description
of
which
was
given
to
me
by
a
farmer
has
caused
me
a
hearty
laugh
it
was
lately
paragraphed
in
all
the
country
as
well
as
the
london
papers
and
spread
far
and
near
that
a
worthy
and
reverend
magistrate
in
this
neighbourhood
had
with
great
liberality
given
away
an
ox
to
his
parishioners
some
in
their
great
bounty
added
eight
or
ten
sheep
to
the
boon
i
was
one
day
speaking
with
due
praise
of
this
act
before
a
farmer
of
the
neighbourhood
who
had
called
to
visit
me
upon
which
he
burst
into
a
loud
horse
laugh
and
exclaimed
oh
the
old
cow
the
fact
was
as
he
informed
me
that
the
worthy
magistrate
had
an
old
norman
cow
that
had
done
breeding
and
consequently
gave
no
more
milk
and
as
every
farmer
in
the
country
well
knows
that
the
devil
himself
could
not
graze
an
old
cow
of
this
sort
to
make
her
fit
for
the
butcher
the
worthy
parson
very
properly
gave
her
away
amongst
his
parishioners
and
the
praises
of
this
mighty
gift
were
hawked
about
in
almost
every
newspaper
in
the
kingdom
i
do
not
give
any
name
neither
do
i
in
the
remotest
degree
bring
forward
the
circumstance
by
way
of
taunt
or
ridicule
there
was
nothing
improper
in
it
but
the
contrary
and
of
course
the
old
cow
afforded
many
a
hearty
meal
and
many
a
full
of
good
wholesome
broth
to
those
amongst
whom
she
was
divided
who
no
doubt
were
very
thankful
to
the
worthy
justice
for
the
present
i
only
mention
it
to
shew
that
it
is
not
all
gold
that
glitters
and
how
such
a
thing
is
trumpeted
forth
when
it
is
once
set
a
going
i
know
it
is
the
practice
of
many
persons
to
give
a
trifle
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
then
get
one
of
their
dependents
to
send
and
not
unfrequently
they
themselves
send
an
account
of
it
to
the
county
paper
away
goes
the
news
and
a
person
name
is
blazoned
forth
all
over
the
kingdom
as
a
most
charitable
man
or
woman
when
it
often
happens
that
a
great
deal
of
misery
poverty
wretchedness
and
want
presents
itself
to
their
view
all
the
year
round
without
their
ever
once
extending
that
aid
which
to
bestow
in
private
would
afford
them
ten
times
as
much
pleasure
and
real
satisfaction
as
they
can
gain
from
their
ostentatious
annual
newspaper
fraud
i
have
given
away
four
times
the
value
of
this
said
cow
every
christmas
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
together
without
having
ever
once
had
or
wishing
to
have
my
name
held
up
in
a
public
newspaper
as
an
example
of
charity
and
liberality
to
the
poor
yet
twenty
years
ago
before
i
was
known
as
a
reformer
when
for
instance
i
was
in
the
king
bench
a
pound
note
a
fifth
part
of
what
waddington
and
i
gave
away
privately
besides
the
ton
of
potatoes
would
have
caused
my
name
to
cut
a
pompous
figure
in
all
the
vehicles
of
news
both
in
town
and
country
i
may
without
boasting
declare
that
scarcely
a
month
in
my
life
ever
passed
without
my
having
given
away
more
than
the
value
of
the
said
old
cow
to
relieve
and
assist
my
fellow
creatures
in
distress
and
yet
the
public
well
know
how
my
name
has
been
bandied
about
in
every
newspaper
in
england
ireland
and
scotland
and
of
late
years
in
almost
every
paper
in
europe
as
the
greatest
enemy
of
the
poor
as
their
deceiver
their
deluder
their
plunderer
i
have
been
held
up
for
political
purposes
by
the
venal
press
as
a
sort
of
ferocious
monster
who
longed
to
gorge
upon
the
of
my
fellow
countrymen
it
will
be
asked
by
some
how
comes
it
that
the
public
press
has
been
induced
to
represent
you
as
a
monster
of
this
description
the
answer
is
easy
for
this
plain
reason
because
all
those
who
belong
to
the
press
the
have
been
the
agents
or
the
tools
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
great
political
factions
whigs
and
tories
because
throughout
the
whole
of
my
political
life
i
have
honestly
opposed
the
peculations
the
plunderings
and
frauds
of
the
of
both
those
two
factions
upon
the
people
upon
the
earnings
of
the
poor
because
i
have
never
in
any
way
been
nor
ever
would
be
linked
on
to
either
of
those
factions
because
i
have
fairly
manfully
and
openly
stood
up
for
the
political
rights
of
my
fellow
countrymen
and
never
for
one
moment
of
my
life
have
compromised
those
rights
in
order
to
secure
or
promote
my
own
interest
i
repeat
again
that
i
have
not
introduced
the
subject
of
the
old
cow
with
any
invidious
motive
as
far
as
the
thing
went
it
was
a
praiseworthy
and
charitable
act
i
have
myself
many
times
done
the
same
thing
have
fatted
an
old
cow
and
given
the
beef
away
to
the
poor
which
has
been
worth
to
them
from
ten
to
fifteen
pounds
very
excellent
meat
to
eat
and
i
have
partaken
of
some
of
it
in
my
own
family
though
it
would
have
scarcely
fetched
any
thing
to
have
been
sold
to
a
butcher
and
if
this
should
meet
the
eye
of
the
worthy
justice
he
will
take
it
as
it
is
meant
and
not
as
any
sarcasm
at
him
though
the
said
justice
is
one
of
the
number
who
was
induced
to
sign
the
infamous
order
to
exclude
my
female
friends
from
visiting
me
which
i
would
fain
hope
he
did
against
his
own
judgment
and
i
am
sure
from
the
personal
kindness
i
before
received
of
him
here
he
did
it
much
against
his
inclination
some
may
say
that
my
statement
of
what
i
have
done
is
an
egotistical
digression
that
i
am
sounding
my
own
trumpet
and
that
to
do
so
is
no
proof
of
a
truly
charitable
disposition
but
let
them
recollect
that
i
am
compelled
to
this
digression
in
order
to
do
justice
to
my
own
calumniated
character
let
them
recollect
that
i
am
writing
my
own
history
and
that
as
the
of
europe
has
been
sedulously
and
malignantly
employed
to
prejudice
the
public
against
me
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
my
children
and
family
to
the
myriads
of
my
fellow
countrymen
who
have
honoured
me
with
their
confidence
i
owe
it
to
them
to
show
past
all
contradiction
that
my
accusers
are
slanderers
that
my
conduct
deserves
to
be
otherwise
spoken
of
than
it
has
been
and
this
duty
i
can
perform
only
by
speaking
candidly
and
boldly
of
such
facts
as
may
tell
in
my
favour
facts
be
it
remembered
which
admit
of
being
proved
or
disproved
by
thousands
of
living
witnesses
i
make
no
assertions
which
are
morally
or
physically
incapable
of
being
refuted
i
appeal
to
evidence
which
is
still
in
existence
and
if
my
enemies
can
convict
one
of
having
in
my
defence
gone
beyond
the
limits
of
truth
i
will
be
content
ever
after
to
listen
in
silence
to
their
calumnies
but
it
is
now
time
to
change
the
scene
again
to
the
king
bench
i
was
there
every
day
in
the
society
of
men
who
had
not
merely
mixed
in
the
busy
scenes
of
the
metropolis
but
of
whom
i
found
that
many
had
been
connected
with
the
government
many
had
borne
a
part
in
all
the
dirty
tricks
frauds
perjuries
and
bribery
practised
at
elections
of
such
abominations
as
i
did
not
think
it
possible
ever
to
have
occurred
the
reality
was
clearly
proved
to
me
by
those
who
had
been
eye
witnesses
of
them
and
who
had
participated
in
the
plunder
brought
me
into
strange
company
and
here
i
saw
men
of
all
persuasions
in
religion
and
of
all
parties
in
politics
the
year
was
a
very
busy
year
and
the
price
of
provisions
was
at
its
height
in
consequence
of
which
there
were
many
riots
both
in
london
and
the
country
the
parliamentary
remedy
for
this
evil
was
an
act
passed
on
the
of
february
forbidding
the
sale
of
bread
till
four
and
twenty
hours
after
it
had
been
baked
towards
the
close
of
buonaparte
became
the
first
consul
of
france
and
he
immediately
wrote
a
letter
himself
to
the
king
of
england
offering
to
treat
for
peace
the
british
ministers
however
treated
the
offer
with
contempt
and
they
were
sanctioned
in
their
conduct
by
the
legislative
bodies
oh
fatal
policy
if
this
offer
had
been
accepted
millions
of
lives
might
have
been
spared
oceans
of
blood
and
hundreds
of
millions
of
money
might
have
been
saved
to
the
nation
fox
and
whitbread
opposed
the
address
in
the
house
of
commons
but
it
was
carried
by
against
high
debates
and
strong
divisions
took
place
in
the
irish
house
of
commons
upon
the
union
when
lord
castlereagh
began
to
make
a
figure
by
his
intrigues
british
gold
prevailed
over
irish
patriotism
and
the
majorities
were
in
favour
of
the
union
waithman
now
first
began
to
figure
upon
the
stage
of
politics
in
london
and
a
motion
which
he
made
in
favour
of
peace
was
carried
unanimously
at
a
common
hall
the
house
of
commons
on
the
motion
of
tierney
divided
for
peace
and
for
war
this
was
on
the
of
february
and
on
the
eleventh
of
may
at
a
in
hyde
park
a
shot
wounded
a
young
gentleman
who
stood
near
the
king
for
whom
no
doubt
it
was
intended
the
same
evening
his
majesty
was
at
drury
lane
theatre
when
a
man
in
the
pit
whose
name
was
hatfield
standing
up
on
one
of
the
benches
fired
a
pistol
at
him
but
he
was
pronounced
to
be
deranged
in
his
intellects
and
he
was
confined
accordingly
all
our
magnanimous
allies
had
by
this
time
deserted
us
with
the
exception
of
the
emperor
of
germany
whose
friendship
was
purchased
by
another
loan
of
two
millions
of
money
to
be
raised
in
taxes
upon
john
bull
or
to
apply
a
more
appropriate
name
for
so
zealous
were
his
faithful
representatives
in
the
commons
that
they
voted
away
millions
for
the
service
of
the
year
and
to
prevent
or
rather
silence
any
grumbling
the
habeas
corpus
suspension
act
was
passed
on
the
fourteenth
of
june
the
great
battle
of
marengo
was
fought
between
the
french
who
were
commanded
by
and
the
austrians
under
melas
whose
army
he
completely
defeated
killing
six
thousand
of
them
and
taking
twelve
thousand
prisoners
and
pieces
of
cannon
in
this
battle
napoleon
proved
himself
not
only
the
bravest
but
the
best
general
of
the
age
immediately
after
this
battle
an
armistice
followed
and
peace
was
ultimately
concluded
between
france
and
austria
on
the
eighteenth
of
this
month
july
the
atrocities
of
governor
aris
and
his
abettors
in
cold
bath
field
prison
were
exposed
in
the
house
of
commons
by
sir
francis
burdett
and
on
the
fourteenth
of
august
following
the
indignant
populace
assembled
to
pull
down
this
prison
which
they
very
properly
called
the
english
bastile
the
conduct
of
aris
was
such
that
he
was
driven
in
disgrace
from
his
situation
and
another
more
humane
governor
was
appointed
in
his
place
in
order
to
tranquillize
the
people
who
were
justly
enraged
almost
to
desperation
against
this
monster
what
a
disgrace
not
only
to
the
administration
of
the
country
but
to
the
character
of
the
age
to
suffer
a
malignant
fiend
to
have
the
control
over
the
liberties
of
persons
sentenced
to
be
confined
in
a
prison
how
much
have
those
magistrates
and
sheriffs
to
answer
for
who
suffer
these
devils
in
human
shape
to
tyrannize
over
and
torture
the
victims
consigned
to
their
custody
how
necessary
is
it
for
sheriffs
high
sheriffs
i
mean
to
visit
their
prisons
in
person
and
see
in
what
manner
their
prisoners
are
treated
i
do
not
mean
a
when
the
gaoler
has
notice
of
his
coming
that
he
may
be
prepared
to
deceive
him
but
i
say
it
is
the
duty
of
a
sheriff
to
go
unawares
at
times
when
he
is
not
expected
and
then
to
visit
the
prisoners
taking
care
that
those
jacks
in
office
the
turnkeys
do
not
go
before
him
to
prepare
the
prisoners
and
to
caution
them
not
to
make
any
complaints
what
a
farce
is
kept
up
by
the
parade
of
visiting
magistrates
who
pass
through
a
gaol
for
instance
once
a
month
like
a
cat
over
a
harpsichord
inquiring
most
likely
in
the
of
the
gaoler
or
turnkey
if
any
of
the
prisoners
have
any
complaint
to
make
to
the
magistrates
oh
what
a
horrible
farce
is
this
a
planter
in
the
west
indies
may
just
as
well
expect
to
hear
the
truth
if
he
were
to
enquire
of
the
negroes
in
the
presence
of
their
whether
any
of
them
have
a
complaint
to
make
against
any
of
the
said
when
i
first
came
to
this
gaol
one
of
the
poor
prisoners
who
was
assisting
to
repair
my
dungeon
was
telling
me
of
an
act
of
cruel
injustice
and
torture
that
had
been
inflicted
upon
him
by
one
of
the
turnkeys
upon
which
i
said
to
the
man
did
you
not
make
a
complaint
to
the
magistrates
i
am
sure
they
would
not
suffer
a
prisoner
to
be
treated
in
such
a
way
with
impunity
the
poor
fellow
looked
at
me
very
steadfastly
for
some
time
to
see
if
i
were
in
earnest
at
length
he
replied
lord
sir
you
will
know
better
after
you
have
been
here
a
little
while
i
have
been
here
nearly
two
years
and
i
never
knew
any
prisoner
make
a
complaint
even
to
the
gaoler
and
much
less
to
the
magistrate
without
being
punished
for
it
i
never
knew
a
man
make
a
complaint
who
was
not
locked
up
in
solitary
confinement
within
a
week
afterwards
for
or
a
prisoner
is
sure
never
to
get
any
redress
for
the
turnkeys
will
say
any
thing
and
what
one
says
another
will
swear
and
the
gaoler
always
believes
them
or
pretends
to
believe
them
in
preference
to
the
prisoners
so
do
what
they
will
with
us
we
never
complain
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
found
that
there
was
too
much
truth
in
this
assertion
i
know
it
is
the
practice
of
some
lords
of
manors
never
to
hire
a
gamekeeper
unless
he
will
engage
to
that
which
right
or
wrong
will
convict
a
poacher
and
i
now
believe
that
it
is
also
a
requisite
qualification
for
a
turnkey
to
swear
that
which
will
please
the
gaoler
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
the
case
in
gaols
in
which
unless
a
turnkey
will
do
this
he
will
never
get
promotion
or
a
rise
in
his
salary
nor
have
his
rent
paid
the
principal
object
of
these
fraternities
appears
to
be
deception
and
particularly
if
a
magistrate
or
a
sheriff
should
be
a
conscientious
humane
man
their
study
their
occupation
is
to
deceive
him
in
which
they
are
very
likely
to
succeed
for
a
clever
gaoler
surrounded
by
such
pliant
helpmates
will
deceive
the
very
devil
if
he
be
not
aware
of
their
tricks
and
how
easily
then
may
they
cheat
an
honest
unsuspecting
country
justice
i
have
been
led
into
this
excusable
digression
from
the
recollection
of
aris
exposure
in
the
house
of
commons
and
what
a
tale
shall
i
have
by
and
by
to
unfold
of
the
scenes
that
are
perpetrated
with
impunity
in
this
gaol
some
of
the
most
atrocious
acts
are
here
made
a
merit
of
and
the
gaoler
even
boasts
of
them
in
the
amongst
his
to
return
to
my
narrative
on
the
of
october
the
common
hall
on
the
motion
of
waithman
resolved
to
present
an
address
to
the
king
upon
the
throne
for
peace
but
for
the
first
time
the
king
refused
to
receive
it
except
at
thus
were
the
livery
of
london
deprived
of
their
right
their
ancient
right
of
approaching
their
sovereign
to
present
their
petitions
to
the
throne
thus
were
all
future
common
halls
reduced
to
the
level
of
any
common
assembly
by
george
the
third
thus
did
those
who
took
the
lead
in
city
politics
concede
the
rights
of
their
and
surrender
their
proudest
privileges
without
a
struggle
from
that
day
to
this
the
livery
of
london
have
never
exercised
their
constitutional
privilege
of
addressing
or
petitioning
the
throne
waithman
and
favel
have
persuaded
the
livery
not
to
petition
the
throne
because
they
were
not
permitted
to
present
it
to
the
throne
unlike
beckford
they
had
neither
the
courage
to
demand
the
right
nor
the
sincerity
to
give
it
up
by
such
temporising
means
they
have
altogether
compromised
the
rights
of
their
fellow
citizens
i
made
one
effort
to
rouse
the
livery
into
a
sense
of
their
duty
and
moved
for
the
appointment
of
a
committee
to
search
for
precedents
but
the
whig
cabal
frustrated
my
intentions
though
i
was
supported
by
white
of
the
independent
whig
and
many
other
patriotic
members
of
that
body
by
and
by
i
shall
lay
open
to
public
view
the
despicable
intrigues
of
this
faction
in
the
city
of
london
the
mass
of
the
livery
are
honest
honourable
and
patriotic
and
real
lovers
of
fair
play
but
the
tricks
and
intrigues
of
the
factions
who
have
strutted
upon
the
boards
of
the
common
hall
for
the
last
twenty
years
are
without
parallel
and
when
i
come
to
that
epoch
of
my
history
at
which
i
became
a
liveryman
it
shall
be
my
business
to
unmask
many
a
hypocrite
and
to
exhibit
these
mock
reformers
in
their
true
colours
in
performing
this
duty
i
shall
divest
myself
of
every
personal
consideration
and
in
drawing
the
true
characters
of
the
great
rivals
wood
and
waithman
i
will
if
possible
divest
myself
of
prejudice
and
do
them
both
justice
the
result
of
the
last
general
election
for
the
city
not
only
speaks
the
sense
of
the
livery
but
it
is
a
pretty
fair
criterion
by
which
the
public
may
estimate
the
value
of
each
of
these
characters
the
inestimable
conduct
of
alderman
wood
with
regard
to
the
affairs
of
the
queen
has
placed
him
upon
that
eminence
to
which
his
honesty
and
public
spirit
so
eminently
entitle
him
on
the
third
of
november
the
emperor
paul
of
russia
laid
an
embargo
on
three
hundred
british
ships
and
sequestered
all
british
property
in
the
ports
of
russia
thus
he
who
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
was
our
most
vigorous
and
magnanimous
ally
became
at
the
latter
end
of
it
one
of
our
most
powerful
and
inveterate
foes
british
gold
and
british
influence
could
however
now
command
the
use
of
the
in
russia
as
it
had
heretofore
directed
the
use
of
the
guillotine
in
france
for
on
the
of
march
he
was
found
murdered
in
his
chamber
and
his
and
son
alexander
the
present
tyrant
succeeded
him
he
being
understood
to
be
better
disposed
to
listen
to
the
proposals
of
the
cabinet
of
james
on
the
last
day
of
this
year
the
union
was
completed
between
england
and
ireland
and
the
degradation
of
that
brave
and
high
spirited
people
was
celebrated
in
london
on
the
first
day
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
hoisting
a
standard
upon
the
tower
and
an
imperial
ensign
was
displayed
by
the
foot
guards
a
new
great
seal
was
also
used
on
account
of
the
union
the
imperial
parliament
also
met
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
and
commenced
its
first
session
the
commencement
of
the
new
century
had
been
celebrated
the
year
before
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
but
it
was
now
discovered
by
the
wisdom
of
john
gull
that
the
new
century
did
not
commence
till
the
old
one
was
finished
and
therefore
millions
who
had
before
celebrated
it
now
performed
the
ceremony
over
again
i
was
then
as
i
now
am
in
a
gaol
but
i
was
in
a
very
different
gaol
from
this
when
paul
clock
struck
twelve
all
the
bells
in
the
metropolis
struck
up
a
merry
peal
i
had
sat
up
later
than
it
was
my
custom
on
purpose
to
welcome
in
the
new
year
and
as
waddington
was
retired
to
rest
i
had
called
up
filewood
the
turnkey
of
the
lobby
of
the
king
bench
and
had
treated
him
with
a
glass
of
grog
and
a
pipe
twenty
years
ago
at
this
very
hour
of
twelve
i
was
smoking
my
pipe
in
a
gaol
gracious
god
the
scenes
that
i
have
since
witnessed
how
they
crowd
upon
my
memory
the
recollection
of
that
night
is
as
familiar
to
my
imagination
as
if
it
were
yesterday
i
was
in
a
prison
to
be
sure
but
i
had
every
accommodation
that
was
necessary
all
my
friends
had
free
access
to
me
from
daylight
till
ten
at
night
and
my
family
might
have
remained
with
me
the
whole
time
day
and
night
if
i
had
chosen
that
they
should
do
so
i
was
never
locked
into
my
room
and
i
could
at
all
times
pass
into
the
yard
and
was
within
call
of
the
turnkey
and
his
family
and
the
communication
to
my
friend
waddington
apartments
was
always
open
in
fact
it
would
have
been
truly
ridiculous
had
it
been
otherwise
the
same
apartments
which
i
inhabited
had
been
previously
occupied
by
horne
tooke
lord
thanet
and
many
other
eminent
political
men
who
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
harpies
of
the
bar
and
the
bench
and
never
did
the
slightest
inconvenience
arise
to
the
marshal
or
any
of
his
officers
in
consequence
of
treating
such
prisoners
committed
to
his
custody
with
that
sort
of
consideration
which
made
them
easy
and
contented
under
unpleasant
circumstances
such
liberal
treatment
always
produced
a
corresponding
feeling
and
action
in
the
prisoners
and
i
never
heard
of
any
instance
of
disagreement
between
them
i
know
that
in
our
case
so
far
from
any
complaint
being
made
on
either
side
waddington
myself
and
the
marshal
always
continued
and
we
parted
upon
the
best
terms
mutually
satisfied
with
each
other
but
what
a
contrast
was
that
to
my
present
situation
in
gaol
one
of
the
most
confined
unhealthy
and
inconvenient
gaols
in
the
kingdom
since
the
high
sheriff
came
to
my
relief
my
confinement
is
considerably
softened
particularly
by
the
admission
of
the
female
branches
of
my
family
but
the
contrast
is
yet
such
as
to
beggar
description
in
the
first
place
i
am
shut
up
in
a
complete
dungeon
it
is
true
i
have
a
window
but
that
is
rendered
almost
useless
by
its
opening
into
a
small
yard
of
about
ten
yards
square
surrounded
entirely
by
a
dark
wall
nearly
twenty
feet
high
this
being
situated
on
the
north
side
of
a
very
high
building
both
light
and
air
are
excluded
i
have
not
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
from
this
yard
or
room
since
october
in
the
next
place
no
friend
or
any
other
person
is
admitted
till
nine
in
the
morning
and
not
after
four
in
the
afternoon
so
that
my
family
who
in
consequence
of
sir
charles
interference
are
now
permitted
to
see
me
are
yet
compelled
to
submit
to
the
inconvenience
and
expense
of
passing
out
of
the
four
and
twenty
at
the
inn
to
be
enabled
to
see
me
for
the
remaining
at
six
in
the
afternoon
i
am
locked
up
in
solitary
confinement
in
my
room
some
time
back
it
was
at
all
the
outward
doors
surrounding
my
burying
vault
of
a
yard
are
also
closed
for
the
night
and
as
my
dungeon
is
situated
in
a
remote
part
of
the
gaol
i
never
hear
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
till
the
door
of
my
cage
is
opened
at
seven
in
the
morning
so
that
for
thirteen
hours
i
have
no
possibility
of
making
any
one
hear
let
what
might
happen
either
from
illness
or
accident
a
month
back
it
was
fifteen
hours
from
till
eight
to
remove
this
unpleasant
and
brutal
inconvenience
a
worthy
and
considerate
visiting
magistrate
aaron
moody
esq
of
kingston
very
properly
ordered
amongst
many
other
necessary
improvements
of
my
den
that
a
bell
should
be
hung
to
enable
me
to
call
one
of
the
officers
of
the
gaol
when
i
might
want
any
thing
but
i
am
now
deprived
of
this
common
and
necessary
accommodation
by
the
order
of
gaoler
who
forsooth
has
caused
the
bell
to
be
muffled
and
the
wire
pegged
so
as
to
render
it
totally
useless
the
reader
must
find
it
difficult
to
discover
the
motives
for
this
and
a
hundred
other
daily
acts
of
petty
tyranny
that
are
practised
upon
me
here
and
to
render
this
conduct
the
more
pointed
unjust
and
odious
the
which
was
hung
at
the
same
time
and
for
the
same
purpose
in
the
room
of
my
kinnear
remains
untouched
for
his
constant
use
and
convenience
and
yet
i
understand
my
gentleman
gaoler
complains
of
what
he
calls
my
attacks
upon
him
although
he
can
not
deny
the
truth
of
one
of
my
statements
from
the
comparison
which
i
have
drawn
the
reader
will
perceive
that
imprisonment
in
this
bastile
is
worse
than
imprisonment
in
the
king
bench
in
the
king
bench
i
enjoyed
the
rational
society
of
all
my
friends
and
i
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
society
of
clifford
i
have
since
suffered
many
great
inconveniences
and
disappointments
which
i
might
have
avoided
if
i
had
given
credit
to
some
of
his
statements
which
at
the
time
i
thought
totally
impossible
to
be
correct
but
which
i
have
since
by
experience
and
to
my
cost
and
sorrow
found
to
be
true
to
the
very
letter
i
was
induced
by
him
to
believe
many
of
the
infamous
acts
attributed
to
the
ministers
and
their
agents
and
the
cruelties
practised
by
their
tools
and
myrmidons
but
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
give
full
credence
to
many
of
the
stories
and
anecdotes
which
he
recounted
of
the
upon
the
bench
in
connivance
with
the
at
the
bar
it
was
difficult
to
make
me
comprehend
and
credit
the
infamous
and
disgraceful
practice
of
the
masters
of
the
crown
office
in
procuring
and
packing
a
special
jury
which
he
assured
me
was
constantly
and
invariably
done
in
every
political
cause
where
the
crown
was
the
prosecutor
but
he
brought
me
so
many
proofs
that
at
length
it
was
worse
than
to
doubt
it
but
that
the
upon
the
bench
in
violation
of
their
solemn
oaths
would
lend
themselves
to
to
or
justice
was
a
crime
which
i
could
not
be
persuaded
to
imagine
was
within
the
verge
of
possibility
though
he
solemnly
assured
me
that
all
this
was
not
only
done
but
that
it
was
the
every
day
practice
particularly
in
political
matters
to
think
that
upon
the
statement
of
one
of
the
counsel
a
judge
would
submit
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
case
before
he
came
into
court
to
think
that
a
judge
could
be
privately
upon
a
cause
that
he
was
going
to
try
openly
in
public
court
that
he
would
be
influenced
by
unworthy
motives
or
take
a
was
so
abhorrent
to
every
notion
of
justice
that
i
had
imbibed
it
was
to
me
so
horrible
that
i
could
scarcely
listen
with
any
degree
of
temper
to
his
recital
of
numerous
instances
of
the
kind
which
he
assured
us
had
come
within
his
own
knowledge
if
i
could
have
had
the
wisdom
to
have
listened
and
have
improved
from
the
excellent
information
that
i
gained
from
clifford
how
many
painful
and
useless
exertions
i
might
have
saved
myself
how
many
difficulties
might
i
have
avoided
but
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
believe
such
things
or
to
think
mankind
and
particularly
the
judges
of
the
land
such
hypocrites
or
such
base
tools
as
he
represented
them
to
be
and
such
is
the
natural
feeling
and
habits
of
an
englishman
that
he
imbibes
the
notion
of
reverence
for
the
judges
of
the
land
at
a
very
early
period
we
are
taught
this
almost
as
early
as
we
are
taught
the
lord
prayer
and
it
is
nearly
as
easy
to
eradicate
the
one
as
the
other
such
is
the
effect
of
early
impressions
poor
clifford
how
often
have
i
heard
him
exclaim
of
all
tyrannies
that
which
is
carried
on
under
the
of
law
and
justice
is
the
worst
how
well
he
understood
the
practice
of
the
courts
and
the
trickery
of
the
judges
every
word
he
ever
communicated
to
me
upon
this
subject
i
now
believe
to
be
true
my
own
experience
has
since
confirmed
it
he
gave
us
the
history
a
full
account
of
the
treatment
of
those
persons
who
were
confined
in
dungeons
for
political
purposes
under
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
amongst
others
he
described
the
cruel
and
unnatural
treatment
of
poor
colonel
despard
who
was
then
confined
in
the
tower
and
who
had
been
imprisoned
at
that
time
for
five
or
six
years
clifford
was
employed
by
colonel
despard
and
offered
to
convince
me
that
his
description
of
his
treatment
was
correct
by
introducing
me
to
him
any
morning
that
i
would
accompany
him
to
the
tower
which
i
promised
to
do
the
first
opportunity
and
a
day
was
fixed
accordingly
for
the
interview
i
received
frequent
communications
from
home
to
say
that
all
my
large
farming
concerns
were
going
on
well
in
fact
those
were
glorious
times
for
farmers
the
price
of
corn
and
all
sorts
of
agricultural
produce
was
enormous
and
as
i
had
grown
most
excellent
crops
that
season
my
profits
were
very
ample
my
bailiff
wrote
me
word
that
he
continued
to
obtain
the
highest
price
in
devizes
market
for
my
corn
both
for
wheat
and
barley
and
one
week
he
sold
wheat
for
five
guineas
a
sack
and
barley
for
five
pounds
a
quarter
this
was
once
thrown
in
my
face
by
an
upstart
of
the
name
of
captain
gee
when
i
was
standing
a
contested
election
at
bristol
the
gentleman
put
the
question
to
me
upon
the
hustings
whether
i
had
not
or
whether
my
father
had
not
sold
his
wheat
for
fifty
pounds
a
load
in
marlborough
market
i
was
saved
the
trouble
of
an
answer
by
the
observation
of
a
sensible
shrewd
mechanic
a
freeman
of
that
city
who
said
well
and
suppose
he
did
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
merit
or
demerit
of
a
representative
who
is
contending
for
our
rights
and
liberties
was
hunt
not
justified
in
selling
his
corn
for
the
best
price
that
he
could
obtain
for
it
it
is
only
a
proof
that
he
had
a
good
article
to
get
a
good
price
for
it
suppose
that
he
had
sold
his
wheat
for
five
pounds
a
load
while
other
people
were
selling
it
at
fifty
pounds
a
load
do
you
mean
to
tell
us
that
here
in
should
have
got
our
flour
or
our
bread
any
the
cheaper
for
it
the
captain
was
silent
and
my
apologist
continued
do
you
believe
sir
if
hunt
had
given
away
his
corn
that
the
millers
or
the
bakers
would
have
sold
it
to
us
any
the
cheaper
then
let
us
have
no
more
of
your
nonsense
what
would
you
have
said
if
your
old
uncle
the
tobacconist
had
sold
his
tobacco
for
one
shilling
a
pound
while
other
people
were
selling
it
at
three
shillings
a
pound
as
his
scheme
did
not
answer
the
captain
slunk
away
and
asked
no
more
questions
i
always
felt
great
pride
in
obtaining
the
highest
price
for
my
it
was
a
sure
proof
that
i
carried
the
best
corn
to
the
market
and
the
farmer
who
grows
the
greatest
quantity
of
and
the
finest
corn
not
only
benefits
himself
but
instead
of
being
an
enemy
to
the
poor
he
is
their
best
friend
as
he
contributes
the
largest
share
to
the
common
stock
of
provisions
for
their
support
my
family
meanwhile
remained
at
home
it
not
being
deemed
advisable
under
such
circumstances
to
remove
them
to
london
for
so
short
a
time
as
six
weeks
hunt
had
to
take
care
of
an
infant
son
now
about
four
months
old
and
besides
i
had
no
one
but
her
to
depend
upon
to
manage
the
domestic
concerns
of
so
large
an
establishment
as
i
then
kept
up
and
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
so
large
a
farming
business
as
i
carried
on
every
thing
however
went
on
smoothly
and
prosperously
and
i
had
no
lack
of
visitors
who
were
very
numerous
both
from
london
and
the
country
and
perhaps
no
nobleman
in
london
was
better
supplied
with
game
than
i
was
i
received
daily
presents
from
all
quarters
particularly
from
the
members
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
not
only
of
the
county
of
wilts
but
from
various
other
counties
though
the
whole
body
of
the
yeomanry
considered
themselves
insulted
in
my
person
yet
the
boasted
resolution
of
those
members
of
the
wiltshire
yeomanry
who
had
declared
that
they
would
resign
if
i
had
any
punishment
inflicted
upon
me
was
never
carried
into
effect
with
one
solitary
exception
which
was
that
of
my
friend
wm
butcher
who
wrote
from
london
the
day
after
my
sentence
and
sent
in
his
resignation
assigning
openly
as
the
cause
that
he
would
not
continue
in
a
service
in
which
he
was
liable
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
by
the
caprice
of
a
superior
officer
or
liable
to
be
prosecuted
if
he
resented
a
wanton
insult
with
the
spirit
of
a
man
of
honour
and
a
gentleman
but
wm
tinker
of
lavington
who
had
so
often
volunteered
to
resent
what
he
called
an
insult
offered
to
every
man
in
the
regiment
never
resigned
or
mentioned
the
subject
afterward
and
he
amongst
all
my
numerous
friends
was
the
only
one
who
failed
to
send
me
some
game
though
he
was
a
great
sportsman
and
did
me
the
favour
to
hunt
and
shoot
over
my
farms
in
my
absence
unlike
some
other
gaolers
the
marshal
of
the
king
bench
was
not
above
his
business
he
never
for
a
moment
neglected
his
duty
to
the
prisoners
he
did
not
act
as
if
he
felt
it
to
be
his
only
business
to
tyrannize
over
to
harrass
to
oppress
to
punish
and
to
torture
those
unfortunate
persons
who
were
committed
to
his
custody
on
the
contrary
he
took
especial
care
to
protect
his
prisoners
from
insult
imposition
or
cruelty
instead
of
employing
his
time
to
devise
means
of
annoyance
against
those
who
were
placed
in
his
custody
he
occupied
it
in
a
very
different
manner
he
knew
that
it
was
his
duty
and
he
acted
up
to
the
letter
and
spirit
of
it
to
take
every
means
in
his
power
to
make
each
prisoner
as
comfortable
as
his
situation
would
admit
and
above
all
to
shield
him
from
any
insult
or
ill
treatment
from
the
officers
of
the
prison
and
to
take
care
that
the
prisoners
were
not
imposed
upon
by
those
who
served
them
with
provisions
and
necessaries
he
made
a
point
of
going
frequently
into
the
prison
during
market
time
and
if
he
found
any
bad
meat
butter
or
other
provisions
brought
into
the
prison
he
would
for
example
sake
have
it
seized
and
destroyed
and
he
frequently
without
previous
notice
went
round
with
his
officers
to
examine
the
weights
and
measures
so
that
his
prisoners
were
completely
guarded
from
imposition
and
extortion
and
a
man
in
the
king
bench
prison
could
lay
out
the
little
money
he
had
to
spend
to
as
much
advantage
as
he
could
in
any
market
in
the
kingdom
in
fact
jones
the
marshal
was
a
humane
as
well
as
a
charitable
man
and
he
encouraged
the
prisoners
to
make
excellent
and
just
regulations
for
their
own
government
but
the
refractory
those
who
would
not
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
well
regulated
society
and
who
violated
all
moral
obligations
were
made
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
power
he
was
a
magistrate
of
the
county
of
surrey
it
therefore
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
perform
the
farce
of
sending
for
a
any
ungovernable
delinquent
was
brought
before
him
and
after
a
fair
hearing
if
it
appeared
upon
oath
that
he
merited
it
he
was
committed
for
a
month
to
horsemonger
lane
prison
or
sentenced
to
be
confined
in
the
refractory
room
i
do
not
remember
a
single
instance
of
any
one
being
punished
by
him
unjustly
when
it
was
necessary
for
the
marshal
to
use
severity
against
any
man
it
generally
had
the
sanction
of
an
immense
majority
of
that
man
the
only
one
that
was
punished
during
the
six
weeks
that
i
was
there
was
a
drunken
captain
who
in
one
of
his
paroxysms
had
smashed
all
the
chapel
windows
and
committed
several
other
depredations
upon
the
property
of
his
fellow
prisoners
he
was
put
into
the
strong
room
till
the
next
day
when
he
was
brought
up
and
after
an
open
and
patient
hearing
it
being
found
that
he
had
nothing
to
urge
in
his
defence
except
drunkenness
he
was
sent
to
horsemonger
lane
for
a
month
no
secret
inflictions
no
acts
of
torture
were
permitted
in
this
gaol
punishment
when
requisite
was
given
openly
and
fairly
and
consistently
with
the
true
principles
of
justice
and
every
one
knew
what
measure
of
it
was
meted
out
to
the
offender
as
there
are
frequently
a
great
number
of
profligate
characters
within
the
walls
it
was
highly
necessary
to
have
some
good
rules
and
regulations
local
to
protect
the
the
innocent
and
the
unfortunate
of
whom
there
was
always
a
great
number
from
the
insults
and
depredations
of
such
abandoned
persons
these
though
they
were
administered
with
strict
justice
by
jones
yet
as
far
as
my
own
observation
enabled
me
to
judge
they
were
invariably
tempered
with
mercy
there
were
frequently
six
or
seven
and
sometimes
eight
hundred
prisoners
within
the
walls
and
the
marshal
had
a
great
responsibility
upon
his
hands
yet
every
thing
was
conducted
with
liberality
he
had
extensive
power
yet
i
never
saw
any
man
exercise
power
with
more
discretion
and
moderation
than
he
did
the
reader
will
recollect
that
this
is
my
opinion
now
my
confirmed
opinion
at
this
period
after
having
been
three
times
committed
to
his
custody
by
the
court
of
king
bench
a
second
time
for
having
given
a
good
thrashing
to
a
ruffian
who
was
hired
to
assault
me
as
i
was
riding
along
the
high
road
and
who
was
proved
to
have
actually
assaulted
me
first
the
judge
baron
graham
upon
the
trial
at
salisbury
instructed
the
jury
to
find
me
guilty
of
an
assault
though
he
admitted
it
to
be
clearly
proved
that
the
fellow
had
committed
the
first
assault
his
argument
if
so
it
may
be
called
was
that
i
had
given
him
more
than
an
equivalent
beating
in
return
had
i
he
said
only
struck
him
once
i
should
have
been
justified
but
as
i
had
struck
him
three
times
with
my
fist
it
was
an
assault
and
for
this
i
was
sentenced
to
to
the
custody
of
the
marshal
but
it
will
be
recollected
that
i
was
then
become
a
political
character
and
had
been
the
means
of
calling
two
meetings
for
the
county
of
wilts
the
third
time
was
preparatory
to
my
visit
here
but
more
of
these
things
at
the
proper
period
while
i
was
in
the
king
bench
many
anecdotes
came
to
my
knowledge
relating
to
certain
political
characters
which
it
would
be
neither
just
nor
prudent
to
mention
here
and
indeed
it
might
justly
be
considered
a
breach
of
confidence
i
must
therefore
withhold
the
publication
of
them
till
i
have
the
permission
of
those
who
communicated
them
to
me
there
were
also
numerous
most
important
matters
communicated
to
me
by
henry
clifford
with
whom
as
the
reader
has
already
been
told
i
soon
became
closely
intimate
which
i
do
not
feel
justified
in
promulgating
as
they
are
of
an
extraordinary
character
and
would
be
scarcely
credited
the
parties
not
being
alive
either
to
contradict
or
to
confirm
them
henry
clifford
was
a
most
intelligent
man
and
doctor
gabriel
was
likewise
an
intelligent
man
and
these
two
individuals
gave
me
a
clear
insight
into
the
practice
of
the
persons
who
were
concerned
in
the
courts
of
law
and
the
church
i
was
not
more
astonished
at
the
trickery
deception
and
complete
delusion
of
the
former
profession
than
i
was
at
the
cant
and
hypocrisy
of
the
latter
i
soon
became
a
disciple
of
clifford
yet
so
astonished
was
i
with
his
account
of
the
mummery
of
the
courts
and
the
farcical
deception
of
what
was
called
the
administration
of
justice
particularly
in
all
political
matters
that
i
really
looked
with
such
astonishment
and
sometimes
with
such
a
suspicious
and
unbelieving
eye
that
he
frequently
thought
it
necessary
to
bring
me
living
proof
and
incontrovertible
demonstration
of
the
truth
of
his
assertions
nor
was
it
till
he
had
done
so
that
he
could
bring
me
to
acknowledge
that
i
was
convinced
of
their
correctness
to
the
doctrine
so
unequivocally
maintained
by
the
worthy
dignitary
of
the
church
gabriel
i
became
a
convert
with
even
still
more
tardiness
waddington
was
an
intelligent
man
and
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
as
a
citizen
of
london
he
had
called
a
public
meeting
at
the
paul
head
tavern
to
for
and
this
and
truly
constitutional
act
was
at
that
period
quite
sufficient
to
draw
down
the
vengeance
of
pitt
and
his
myrmidons
his
ruin
was
decided
upon
by
them
and
he
was
handed
over
to
the
care
of
the
minister
pliant
powerful
and
dangerous
tools
the
judges
of
the
then
court
of
bench
the
chief
performer
being
lloyd
lord
kenyon
clifford
assured
me
that
which
was
afterwards
proved
in
the
same
court
that
there
was
neither
law
nor
justice
in
waddington
persecution
but
that
the
minister
had
determined
to
destroy
him
for
his
decisive
opposition
to
his
measures
in
the
city
and
he
had
not
the
least
doubt
but
they
would
accomplish
the
ruin
of
his
fortune
though
he
was
then
worth
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
it
will
be
shewn
hereafter
how
completely
this
prediction
was
verified
one
morning
while
we
were
at
breakfast
filewood
came
in
and
told
us
that
two
very
elegant
ladies
were
brought
into
the
prison
for
debt
and
that
they
were
in
the
greatest
distress
as
they
appeared
to
be
deserted
by
all
their
friends
and
had
scarcely
money
sufficient
to
procure
the
common
necessaries
of
life
this
was
quite
sufficient
to
induce
waddington
and
myself
to
interest
ourselves
in
their
behalf
and
we
made
the
necessary
inquiries
in
which
we
were
assisted
with
great
alacrity
by
the
officers
of
the
gaol
and
we
learned
that
the
parties
were
a
gentlewoman
and
her
daughter
the
mother
being
arrested
for
a
considerable
sum
and
being
sent
into
the
gaol
the
daughter
had
accompanied
her
a
polite
letter
tendering
our
humble
aid
was
sent
to
the
ladies
accompanied
with
an
invitation
to
dinner
this
invitation
was
accepted
but
a
difficulty
arose
as
we
were
without
the
walls
and
the
ladies
were
within
which
appeared
at
first
view
to
be
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
their
visiting
us
for
although
we
could
pass
into
the
prison
yet
no
prisoner
within
the
walls
could
pass
out
unless
by
a
in
term
time
or
the
special
permission
of
the
marshal
which
no
one
expected
to
obtain
without
giving
sufficient
security
i
nevertheless
determined
to
apply
to
the
marshal
as
we
were
not
to
be
driven
without
an
effort
from
the
pleasure
of
doing
a
kind
action
after
we
had
once
made
up
our
minds
to
it
we
knew
the
character
of
the
marshal
to
be
that
of
a
gentleman
and
as
i
felt
no
dread
at
the
idea
of
placing
myself
under
an
obligation
to
such
a
man
i
without
further
ceremony
waited
upon
him
and
communicated
the
circumstances
and
our
wishes
upon
the
subject
without
the
slightest
hesitation
he
granted
my
request
and
having
called
his
deputy
he
demanded
the
reason
why
he
had
not
been
made
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
the
ladies
who
had
been
brought
in
the
night
before
and
he
called
for
the
books
to
know
who
the
lady
was
and
what
sum
she
was
in
for
it
was
found
that
her
name
was
m
e
and
that
she
was
detained
for
three
hundred
pounds
i
immediately
offered
to
the
marshal
to
become
security
for
the
sum
if
he
had
any
difficulty
about
it
his
only
answer
was
your
word
hunt
is
quite
sufficient
and
turning
to
the
officer
he
said
recollect
sir
that
m
e
and
her
daughter
have
free
access
to
hunt
and
waddington
apartments
to
dine
drink
tea
and
spend
the
evening
whenever
they
please
to
invite
them
and
take
care
also
that
they
have
a
good
room
provided
for
them
if
they
have
not
already
got
such
within
the
walls
thus
it
was
at
all
times
with
this
worthy
man
i
never
knew
him
interpose
to
prevent
an
act
of
kindness
or
of
charity
to
a
prisoner
but
on
the
contrary
he
was
always
ready
to
promote
their
comfort
and
willing
to
assist
in
relieving
the
distresses
of
those
who
were
in
affliction
m
and
her
daughter
arrived
at
the
hour
appointed
she
was
a
tall
elegant
figure
apparently
upwards
of
fifty
and
her
face
though
clouded
by
misfortune
bore
evident
traces
of
no
common
beauty
her
manners
and
address
were
at
once
graceful
dignified
and
unembarrassed
her
daughter
was
a
pretty
little
interesting
girl
of
eighteen
and
though
she
was
very
accomplished
yet
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
she
had
not
received
that
highly
refined
education
nor
enjoyed
those
advantages
which
can
only
be
acquired
by
associating
with
persons
who
have
moved
in
the
first
circles
of
fashionable
society
all
which
advantages
her
mother
evidently
possessed
in
a
very
eminent
degree
m
appeared
to
be
well
acquainted
with
pitt
dundas
and
some
of
the
royal
family
but
as
the
conversation
turned
upon
general
subjects
we
did
not
enter
into
any
further
particulars
on
the
first
visit
we
confined
ourselves
to
making
arrangements
for
the
future
comfort
of
the
ladies
while
they
remained
within
the
walls
and
this
object
waddington
and
myself
with
the
cheerful
cooperation
of
the
marshal
easily
contrived
to
promote
after
a
visit
or
two
i
became
enthusiastically
interested
in
the
fate
of
m
i
discovered
that
she
had
moved
a
great
deal
in
the
higher
circles
and
was
particularly
well
acquainted
with
the
ministers
of
the
crown
and
a
certain
great
personage
as
she
saw
that
she
had
excited
if
not
an
interest
at
least
a
great
curiosity
in
my
breast
she
told
me
that
she
was
the
natural
daughter
of
the
late
the
great
marquis
of
g
and
that
as
her
had
been
a
most
eventful
life
she
would
relate
to
me
some
very
extraordinary
incidents
in
it
if
i
would
favour
her
with
an
interview
some
morning
this
was
readily
assented
to
and
our
meeting
was
fixed
for
the
following
day
her
history
was
briefly
as
follows
she
had
been
brought
up
by
the
marquis
of
g
and
educated
by
him
with
great
care
and
tenderness
she
married
young
and
was
an
early
widow
after
the
death
of
her
husband
she
fell
a
victim
to
the
seductive
powers
of
old
harry
d
s
and
became
his
mistress
which
she
continued
to
be
for
many
years
during
that
time
she
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
great
deal
of
pitt
of
whom
and
his
associates
she
told
me
a
vast
number
of
anecdotes
which
will
not
do
to
mention
here
her
old
paramour
at
length
became
tired
of
her
and
a
very
extraordinary
event
led
to
an
opportunity
of
shifting
her
off
his
hands
without
the
inconvenience
of
making
her
a
settlement
a
certain
great
personage
was
at
that
time
labouring
under
a
distressing
malady
the
physicians
in
attendance
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
that
their
patient
should
have
a
female
attendant
during
the
night
and
the
finding
of
a
proper
person
for
the
occasion
was
the
only
obstacle
which
interposed
to
prevent
their
carrying
their
wish
into
effect
old
harry
d
s
proposed
to
obviate
this
difficulty
by
making
a
sacrifice
as
he
pretended
of
his
favourite
mistress
upon
condition
that
an
annuity
of
four
hundred
pounds
should
be
settled
upon
her
this
proposal
was
immediately
accepted
and
the
terms
were
acceded
to
by
the
family
of
the
afflicted
personage
though
the
wary
old
scotchman
was
delighted
to
get
rid
of
his
mistress
upon
such
advantageous
terms
for
himself
or
rather
to
drive
such
an
excellent
bargain
yet
he
all
the
time
professed
that
he
was
making
the
greatest
sacrifice
in
the
world
and
doing
the
greatest
violence
to
his
feelings
by
parting
with
a
beloved
object
a
sacrifice
which
he
was
induced
to
make
solely
from
the
love
and
veneration
which
he
bore
to
his
afflicted
master
she
assured
us
of
her
belief
that
by
these
means
he
obtained
the
greatest
favours
and
the
most
splendid
reward
while
she
for
the
sum
of
four
hundred
a
year
consented
to
submit
to
the
embraces
of
a
madman
the
patient
recovered
and
she
was
turned
adrift
without
her
salary
being
regularly
paid
she
had
contracted
a
debt
of
three
hundred
pounds
for
which
she
was
sent
to
the
king
bench
prison
though
she
convinced
me
by
documents
that
she
produced
that
she
had
at
the
time
seven
quarters
of
her
salary
seven
hundred
pounds
due
to
her
from
the
said
great
personage
less
than
half
of
which
would
have
saved
her
from
a
gaol
this
circumstance
however
extraordinary
it
may
appear
was
not
only
confirmed
by
very
credible
witnesses
but
also
by
most
indisputable
documentary
proof
and
as
a
confirmation
of
its
correctness
dundas
who
was
subsequently
lord
melville
a
few
days
afterwards
came
in
person
to
bail
her
into
the
rules
which
i
sincerely
believe
that
he
never
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
heard
of
the
that
she
had
fallen
into
m
and
her
daughter
were
at
dinner
with
waddington
and
myself
when
dundas
sent
for
her
out
but
we
made
him
wait
till
she
had
finished
her
dinner
declaring
that
we
would
be
her
bail
rather
than
she
should
submit
to
receive
a
favour
from
such
an
unnatural
being
this
lady
gave
me
a
history
of
the
then
court
and
she
was
familiar
with
extraordinary
anecdotes
relating
to
most
of
the
persons
connected
with
the
ministers
as
well
as
the
royal
family
the
recital
of
so
much
infamy
and
intrigue
when
coupled
with
what
i
had
heard
from
clifford
of
the
practices
of
the
law
and
the
courts
of
justice
and
from
gabriel
with
respect
to
the
debaucheries
of
the
most
dignified
members
of
the
church
and
the
hypocrisy
of
many
of
its
puritanical
preachers
really
made
me
almost
believe
that
i
was
got
into
a
new
world
and
that
the
men
and
women
of
which
it
was
composed
were
a
different
species
from
those
with
whom
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
associating
in
fact
it
opened
to
my
view
such
scenes
of
villainy
fraud
hypocrisy
and
injustice
practised
upon
mankind
by
those
who
contrived
to
govern
them
by
what
is
called
religion
and
law
that
i
involuntarily
with
an
exclamation
the
sentiments
of
clifford
and
pronounced
aloud
that
there
is
no
tyranny
so
infamous
as
that
which
is
carried
on
under
the
of
law
and
justice
i
had
here
an
opportunity
of
meeting
men
of
talent
and
men
of
experience
and
particularly
some
eminent
men
of
the
law
who
although
they
were
not
public
characters
like
clifford
and
therefore
did
not
promulgate
their
sentiments
so
publicly
as
he
did
yet
all
admitted
the
truth
of
his
description
of
the
state
of
the
courts
of
law
and
my
lord
kenyon
was
spoken
of
with
great
freedom
and
his
decisions
were
canvassed
with
very
little
ceremony
i
have
already
mentioned
that
colonel
despard
was
confined
in
the
tower
by
the
secretary
of
state
lord
hobart
in
virtue
of
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
that
clifford
had
promised
that
he
would
take
me
to
the
tower
and
introduce
me
to
the
colonel
the
day
having
at
length
arrived
for
the
performance
of
his
promise
clifford
called
on
me
and
we
walked
together
to
london
bridge
where
we
took
a
boat
to
tower
stairs
after
entering
our
names
in
the
book
which
has
been
invariably
the
practice
at
the
tower
we
were
admitted
to
the
apartment
of
colonel
despard
he
was
a
mild
man
clifford
introduced
me
by
name
as
a
country
friend
of
his
and
the
colonel
received
me
with
great
courtesy
and
politeness
during
our
stay
he
inveighed
with
some
warmth
against
the
injustice
of
his
treatment
and
the
protracted
length
of
his
imprisonment
which
he
said
i
think
was
then
nearly
six
years
two
were
always
in
the
room
with
him
when
any
person
was
admitted
and
they
never
left
the
room
even
when
his
wife
came
to
see
him
but
as
far
as
was
in
their
power
consistent
with
the
orders
which
they
had
received
and
were
obliged
to
obey
they
conducted
themselves
with
great
propriety
and
civility
toward
the
colonel
and
his
friends
he
laughed
heartily
at
the
idea
of
a
visit
from
me
who
was
at
the
time
a
prisoner
in
the
king
bench
and
clifford
surprised
him
when
he
said
that
i
had
entered
my
name
henry
hunt
king
bench
which
i
had
done
to
shew
me
the
stile
in
which
the
procession
accompanied
the
prisoner
clifford
proposed
a
walk
upon
the
terrace
he
had
described
this
ceremony
to
me
and
it
appeared
so
preposterous
that
he
saw
i
looked
doubtful
as
to
whether
i
should
believe
him
to
be
serious
when
he
observed
that
i
looked
suspicious
he
always
took
uncommon
pains
to
convince
me
by
some
unequivocal
proof
and
this
was
his
motive
for
proposing
a
walk
a
guard
of
soldiers
was
called
and
the
procession
was
as
follows
one
of
the
walked
first
with
his
sword
drawn
then
followed
two
soldiers
carrying
arms
with
their
bayonets
fixed
then
came
colonel
despard
with
clifford
and
myself
one
on
each
side
of
him
immediately
behind
us
marched
two
more
soldiers
carrying
arms
with
fixed
bayonets
and
another
with
a
drawn
sword
brought
up
the
rear
in
this
manner
we
walked
the
parade
or
terrace
for
about
half
an
hour
taking
care
to
speak
loud
so
that
the
whole
of
our
conversation
was
heard
by
the
after
our
walk
we
sat
with
him
a
short
time
and
then
took
our
leave
anxious
to
hear
something
more
of
the
particulars
relating
to
the
confinement
of
the
colonel
i
called
a
coach
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
put
us
down
at
the
king
bench
where
clifford
had
engaged
to
dine
with
us
as
we
rode
along
i
began
to
ply
my
companion
to
inform
me
what
desperate
offence
colonel
despard
had
committed
which
called
for
such
rigorous
treatment
his
answer
was
this
he
served
the
government
faithfully
and
zealously
as
a
soldier
he
advanced
money
for
them
upon
some
foreign
station
but
the
government
was
ungrateful
and
ungenerous
to
him
and
in
consequence
of
some
quibble
they
have
refused
to
repay
him
what
he
advanced
on
their
account
he
complained
and
remonstrated
he
became
importunate
for
justice
he
was
considered
troublesome
and
for
complaining
they
have
sent
him
to
prison
under
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
as
the
only
effectual
means
of
answering
his
just
complaints
and
can
it
be
possible
i
asked
that
justice
will
not
in
the
end
be
done
to
this
unfortunate
gentleman
depend
upon
it
replied
clifford
he
is
too
honest
ever
to
gain
redress
if
he
would
crouch
and
truckle
to
his
persecutors
he
might
not
only
be
set
at
liberty
but
all
that
they
have
robbed
him
of
would
be
returned
this
however
he
never
will
do
he
poor
fellow
expects
that
when
the
operation
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
is
restored
he
will
be
able
to
bring
his
cruel
persecutors
to
justice
but
he
will
be
deceived
he
is
marked
out
for
one
of
that
monster
pitt
victims
when
he
comes
out
which
will
be
when
the
suspension
act
expires
and
not
before
i
know
that
he
will
demand
to
be
put
upon
his
trial
but
the
ministers
who
have
always
a
corrupt
majority
at
their
beck
will
easily
procure
an
act
of
indemnity
and
as
they
have
nothing
to
charge
him
with
they
will
refuse
to
give
him
a
trial
and
they
will
laugh
at
him
and
this
is
the
boasted
freedom
of
the
people
of
england
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
ministers
serve
those
who
oppose
them
these
are
the
methods
they
take
first
to
punish
and
then
to
drive
their
opponents
into
violence
and
into
acts
of
desperation
i
know
that
he
will
complain
and
that
he
has
just
cause
of
complaint
and
i
dread
the
consequence
because
i
know
full
well
their
arts
and
the
power
which
they
have
to
carry
their
diabolical
plans
into
execution
if
he
be
troublesome
they
will
stick
at
nothing
and
i
should
not
be
the
least
surprised
if
they
were
ultimately
to
have
some
of
their
spies
to
swear
away
his
life
gracious
god
i
little
thought
how
prophetic
these
words
were
was
this
really
the
case
you
were
his
counsel
upon
his
trial
you
must
know
if
this
were
really
the
case
but
more
of
this
hereafter
after
the
death
of
poor
despard
clifford
and
myself
never
met
that
i
did
not
recall
to
his
recollection
the
prophetic
conversation
that
took
place
in
the
coach
as
we
passed
over
london
bridge
and
up
the
borough
on
our
return
from
the
tower
all
the
particulars
of
the
trial
and
the
execution
of
colonel
despard
are
fresh
in
my
memory
but
i
shall
be
much
obliged
to
some
friend
who
may
chance
to
read
this
to
send
me
the
itself
through
my
publisher
dolby
i
shall
also
be
much
pleased
if
some
one
will
furnish
me
with
the
names
of
those
persons
who
were
waiting
in
readiness
to
come
forward
and
prove
that
the
witnesses
who
swore
to
the
facts
against
the
colonel
were
persons
of
the
most
infamous
character
and
not
worthy
to
believed
upon
their
oaths
which
persons
were
neglected
to
be
called
by
mr
sergeant
best
clifford
told
me
their
names
often
but
they
do
not
occur
to
me
now
therefore
i
shall
be
obliged
to
some
one
to
furnish
me
with
the
particulars
when
we
got
back
to
the
king
bench
we
were
informed
by
waddington
that
there
had
been
a
great
inquiry
for
me
in
my
absence
as
some
friends
out
of
the
country
had
been
to
visit
me
and
had
foolishly
enough
made
much
stir
in
the
king
bench
in
their
endeavour
to
find
me
waddington
however
having
learned
what
was
going
on
satisfied
their
inquiries
so
far
as
to
induce
them
to
be
quiet
and
promise
to
call
the
next
day
some
of
my
readers
will
be
surprised
that
a
prisoner
should
have
been
from
home
but
the
fact
was
that
i
was
committed
to
the
of
the
marshal
of
the
for
six
weeks
and
i
had
given
him
ample
security
for
being
at
all
times
ready
to
appear
in
case
he
should
be
called
upon
to
produce
his
prisoner
they
were
not
then
so
particular
as
they
now
are
the
visit
to
the
tower
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
my
mind
and
after
what
i
had
witnessed
i
was
easily
persuaded
by
clifford
that
the
account
which
he
gave
me
of
the
treatment
of
other
prisoners
confined
under
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
perfectly
true
these
horrible
facts
created
in
my
breast
a
antipathy
to
that
tyranny
which
is
perpetrated
under
the
disguise
under
the
false
colour
the
mere
forms
of
law
and
justice
and
sanctioned
by
the
hypocritical
mummeries
of
superstition
instead
of
real
religion
after
dinner
clifford
described
to
us
a
scene
of
which
he
had
been
a
spectator
in
the
tower
the
week
before
when
he
went
there
with
despard
to
consult
with
the
colonel
and
to
make
his
will
the
colonel
being
then
and
having
long
been
labouring
under
a
serious
complaint
which
had
been
brought
on
by
the
length
of
his
confinement
and
which
was
considered
as
dangerous
by
his
physician
during
the
whole
of
that
time
the
remained
in
the
room
so
that
even
the
sacred
obligation
of
making
his
last
will
could
not
be
performed
unless
it
was
done
in
the
presence
and
in
the
hearing
of
the
officers
of
the
tower
and
they
actually
became
the
subscribing
witnesses
to
his
will
i
had
now
become
acquainted
with
many
political
characters
and
i
was
frequently
invited
by
clifford
to
go
down
to
wimbledon
with
him
on
a
sunday
to
join
the
public
parties
of
horne
tooke
from
whom
he
promised
to
insure
me
a
hearty
welcome
vulgar
prejudice
against
this
extraordinary
and
highly
gifted
man
had
however
got
such
possession
of
my
feelings
that
i
continually
made
some
excuse
for
i
had
imbibed
a
notion
that
he
was
an
artful
intriguing
person
of
an
insinuating
address
who
frequently
led
young
politicians
into
scrapes
and
difficulties
my
idea
of
him
in
politics
was
that
he
was
a
violent
jacobin
and
an
enemy
to
his
king
and
country
and
this
was
quite
enough
to
make
me
avoid
his
company
the
real
fact
was
that
i
was
afraid
to
trust
myself
in
his
society
i
had
no
wish
to
become
a
politician
and
as
i
found
that
the
principles
of
liberty
which
clifford
inculcated
had
made
a
considerable
impression
upon
my
mind
i
was
afraid
to
encourage
too
far
my
natural
propensity
to
resist
injustice
oppression
and
tyranny
i
did
not
wish
to
fan
the
flame
which
clifford
eloquence
and
convincing
arguments
had
lighted
in
my
breast
another
reason
for
my
refusing
to
make
one
of
the
wimbledon
parties
was
the
probability
that
i
should
there
meet
with
sir
francis
burdett
whom
i
was
induced
to
look
upon
almost
as
a
political
madman
a
dangerous
firebrand
in
the
hands
of
tooke
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
nothing
less
than
a
designing
incendiary
clifford
took
some
pains
to
persuade
me
out
of
my
ridiculous
notions
yet
in
the
account
which
he
gave
me
of
character
he
in
some
measure
confirmed
me
in
the
opinion
that
i
had
previously
formed
as
tooke
certainly
made
sir
burdett
a
puppet
to
carry
on
his
hostility
against
those
ministers
who
had
persecuted
him
and
aimed
a
deadly
blow
at
his
life
tooke
was
a
man
of
profound
talent
a
persevering
friend
of
liberty
and
an
implacable
foe
to
the
measures
of
pitt
but
he
only
supported
partial
not
general
liberty
he
was
no
friend
of
universal
suffrage
he
supported
the
householder
or
rather
the
direct
tax
paying
suffrage
to
those
who
contended
for
universal
suffrage
namely
the
duke
of
richmond
major
cartwright
and
others
he
made
this
comprehensive
intelligible
reply
you
may
go
all
the
way
to
windsor
if
you
please
but
i
shall
stop
short
at
hounslow
thus
implying
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
give
political
freedom
to
more
than
one
half
of
the
people
that
he
would
not
go
farther
than
hounslow
which
is
not
half
way
to
windsor
sir
francis
burdett
gloried
in
being
thought
a
disciple
of
tooke
the
sunday
parties
at
wimbledon
were
composed
of
the
disaffected
persons
in
london
and
westminster
amongst
the
number
stood
the
noted
tailor
frank
place
who
was
always
an
avowed
republican
profession
poor
samuel
miller
the
shoemaker
in
poor
old
thomas
hardy
and
many
others
with
whom
i
did
not
become
acquainted
till
some
time
after
this
period
though
i
collected
their
characters
from
my
friend
clifford
thelwall
had
cut
the
concern
and
set
up
in
another
line
that
of
a
fashionable
teacher
of
elocution
at
this
period
my
taste
leaned
more
to
the
sports
of
the
field
to
hunting
shooting
and
fishing
than
to
any
thing
else
and
as
these
amusements
were
more
congenial
to
my
habits
and
my
large
farming
concerns
in
the
country
i
never
while
i
was
the
first
time
in
prison
sought
much
for
political
information
though
i
necessarily
heard
a
great
deal
of
politics
from
my
friends
waddington
and
clifford
as
well
as
from
numerous
political
characters
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
in
consequence
of
their
coming
to
visit
the
former
gentleman
indeed
seldom
a
day
passed
without
seeing
some
half
dozen
or
half
score
of
them
friends
were
almost
all
opposition
men
in
politics
but
his
relations
were
one
and
all
backbone
loyalists
or
rather
royalists
my
young
friend
william
butcher
was
delighted
with
the
society
of
clifford
butcher
was
a
disciple
of
thomas
paine
he
had
been
bred
up
in
a
country
village
where
the
clergyman
evans
of
little
bedwin
who
was
his
associate
had
instilled
into
his
mind
all
the
principles
of
paine
both
political
and
theological
and
consequently
butcher
was
delighted
with
the
society
that
he
had
met
with
at
our
table
butcher
was
a
famous
great
politician
over
the
bottle
he
would
be
as
valiant
as
any
man
yet
he
would
never
the
reason
he
used
to
assign
for
never
meddling
in
active
politics
was
that
except
in
a
republic
no
private
citizen
could
ever
attain
the
eminence
of
being
the
first
man
in
the
country
and
no
man
he
thought
could
have
a
proper
stimulus
unless
he
could
hope
to
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
government
washington
was
his
idol
and
the
american
constitution
was
his
creed
in
politics
he
was
enraptured
to
hear
me
listen
with
so
much
earnestness
and
attention
to
the
political
dogmas
of
clifford
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
them
for
clifford
never
professed
to
wish
for
a
republican
government
he
always
contended
that
the
english
constitution
if
it
were
administered
in
its
purity
was
quite
good
enough
for
englishmen
in
this
opinion
i
then
concurred
with
him
and
from
this
opinion
i
have
never
once
in
my
life
swerved
up
to
this
hour
a
government
of
king
lords
and
commons
so
that
the
latter
are
fairly
chosen
by
all
the
commons
would
secure
to
us
the
full
enjoyment
of
rational
liberty
i
am
for
that
liberty
which
is
secured
and
protected
by
the
government
of
the
laws
and
not
by
the
government
of
the
sword
but
those
laws
must
be
such
as
are
made
by
the
commons
the
whole
people
of
england
and
not
the
arbitrary
laws
that
are
made
by
the
few
for
the
government
of
the
whole
not
the
laws
that
are
made
by
the
few
for
the
partial
and
unjust
benefit
of
the
few
at
the
expence
and
cost
of
the
whole
clifford
was
the
of
sir
charles
wolseley
the
worthy
baronet
first
lady
being
clifford
sister
my
good
and
excellent
friend
and
true
radical
sir
charles
wolseley
baronet
is
as
well
as
myself
the
political
disciple
of
the
honest
counsellor
clifford
if
clifford
poor
fellow
were
now
alive
how
he
would
laugh
to
see
two
of
his
staunchest
and
most
disinterested
political
disciples
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
boroughmongers
but
he
would
also
laugh
to
see
the
melancholy
state
to
which
the
said
boroughmongers
are
reduced
now
they
have
caught
us
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
us
through
clifford
i
learned
how
they
managed
matters
in
the
courts
and
waddington
who
by
this
time
had
had
considerable
experience
was
most
violent
against
the
injustice
of
the
persecution
which
he
had
experienced
at
this
period
he
possessed
a
large
quantity
of
hops
perhaps
half
the
hops
in
the
kingdom
which
he
had
purchased
upon
a
speculation
that
there
would
be
a
very
bad
crop
his
calculations
turned
out
to
be
correct
and
the
hops
that
he
had
purchased
at
ten
pounds
a
hundred
were
now
worth
and
pounds
they
were
all
in
the
borough
and
he
was
selling
them
off
at
this
advance
in
price
when
the
conspiracy
was
formed
against
him
at
the
head
of
which
was
timothy
brown
of
the
firm
of
whitbread
and
brown
pitt
in
order
to
punish
waddington
for
calling
the
meeting
at
the
paul
head
tavern
in
the
city
to
petition
the
king
for
peace
and
the
removal
of
ministers
lent
himself
and
his
agents
to
further
the
objects
of
this
conspiracy
of
brewers
against
waddington
and
as
kenyon
the
chief
justice
was
a
devoted
instrument
of
the
minister
waddington
was
not
only
fined
and
sentenced
to
six
months
imprisonment
for
forestalling
hops
but
acts
of
parliament
were
passed
to
permit
the
brewers
to
use
foreign
hops
quassia
or
any
other
drug
or
ingredient
as
a
substitute
by
these
unjustifiable
and
partial
proceedings
the
very
same
hops
that
were
worth
and
had
been
selling
at
pounds
a
hundred
were
reduced
down
to
five
pounds
and
even
to
three
pounds
a
hundred
timothy
brown
was
at
the
head
of
those
brewers
who
acted
as
the
tools
of
the
minister
to
persecute
waddington
not
for
forestalling
hops
but
actually
for
standing
up
to
do
his
duty
in
the
city
of
london
as
a
liveryman
to
oppose
the
ruinous
system
of
ministers
and
it
is
the
best
proof
that
can
be
given
of
his
earnestness
and
sincerity
that
they
never
relaxed
in
their
persecutions
against
him
till
they
had
ruined
him
he
was
a
merchant
a
banker
at
maidstone
and
a
trader
and
of
course
he
was
largely
concerned
in
money
transactions
now
the
government
can
always
silence
any
man
in
this
situation
or
ruin
him
and
his
credit
if
he
becomes
really
sincere
in
his
opposition
to
them
and
this
is
one
good
reason
why
we
radicals
have
nothing
to
expect
from
merchants
bankers
and
traders
the
ministers
have
no
objection
to
those
persons
who
carry
on
a
whig
because
that
is
all
in
the
way
of
business
they
are
all
in
the
regiment
and
although
they
are
upon
what
is
called
yet
they
belong
to
the
regiment
and
are
always
in
the
expectancy
of
being
called
into
active
service
again
the
ministers
generally
employ
some
of
these
expectants
to
do
their
dirty
work
for
them
and
any
measure
that
is
prosecuted
by
the
whigs
is
least
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
thought
by
a
great
number
of
but
ignorant
people
to
be
perfectly
justifiable
as
i
pass
along
i
shall
be
able
to
prove
to
the
reader
how
well
the
manage
these
matters
how
skilfully
they
always
play
into
each
other
hands
against
the
rights
the
property
and
the
liberties
of
the
people
for
instance
if
the
ministers
want
any
obnoxious
measure
brought
into
parliament
such
an
one
as
if
it
were
to
be
suggested
by
themselves
would
create
a
great
public
feeling
alarm
and
hostility
to
it
throughout
the
country
to
wit
if
they
want
to
carry
a
corn
bill
to
raise
or
keep
up
the
price
of
corn
three
or
four
shillings
a
bushel
the
effect
of
which
is
to
lay
a
tax
of
twenty
or
thirty
millions
a
year
upon
the
people
who
consume
it
they
are
cunning
enough
to
put
forward
one
of
those
whigs
henry
an
irish
whig
baronet
must
forsooth
be
the
ostensible
parent
of
the
measure
while
the
ministers
are
professing
openly
to
be
doubtful
of
its
expediency
and
policy
when
all
this
has
been
done
to
sound
the
people
they
at
length
with
a
seeming
reluctance
yield
to
the
suggestions
of
the
landed
interest
and
the
urgency
of
the
state
and
should
the
people
begin
to
be
importunate
and
remonstrate
against
the
measure
why
then
it
is
only
necessary
to
bring
upon
the
scene
their
principal
westminster
pride
to
wit
and
if
he
will
but
just
say
at
a
westminster
meeting
the
measure
is
of
little
consequence
either
to
him
or
his
and
if
when
he
is
called
upon
in
the
house
by
my
lord
castlereagh
to
speak
honestly
his
sentiments
respecting
the
measure
he
will
get
up
and
merely
tell
the
noble
lord
he
deserves
to
be
impeached
but
that
as
to
the
corn
bill
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
him
whether
it
is
passed
or
not
that
he
is
as
much
for
it
as
against
it
but
that
he
does
not
care
which
way
it
goes
why
then
the
juggle
is
rendered
complete
oh
what
a
farce
what
a
delusion
but
the
ministers
having
got
this
hero
on
their
side
the
measure
passes
and
the
people
are
duped
and
deceived
as
i
proceed
in
my
history
i
shall
be
able
to
shew
to
the
public
how
necessary
these
are
to
the
ministers
and
how
often
they
have
successfully
played
them
off
against
the
people
so
it
was
in
this
case
the
judges
knew
that
there
was
no
law
against
waddington
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
make
a
shew
of
great
feeling
and
interest
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
and
this
timothy
brown
who
was
a
whig
and
a
partner
of
whitbread
was
selected
as
the
instrument
upon
this
occasion
he
was
so
selected
because
he
bore
waddington
a
personal
hatred
and
was
glad
to
pursue
him
with
vindictive
hostility
for
a
harmless
joke
which
waddington
had
played
upon
him
nor
did
he
cease
his
attacks
upon
him
till
he
actually
ruined
him
i
will
now
explain
the
cause
of
his
hatred
and
hostility
waddington
who
was
an
active
intelligent
persevering
man
of
business
and
who
besides
being
a
banker
at
maidstone
in
the
heart
of
east
kent
was
also
engaged
in
the
hop
trade
as
a
hop
merchant
in
the
borough
was
a
great
speculator
in
this
speculating
business
which
always
was
considered
as
a
business
of
chance
rather
than
of
judgment
as
however
games
of
chance
are
greatly
governed
by
the
penetration
of
those
who
play
them
waddington
payed
that
attention
to
the
growth
of
hops
that
he
made
it
rather
a
game
of
certainty
than
of
hazard
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
this
gentleman
thought
that
he
discovered
a
considerable
stagnation
in
the
growth
of
the
vine
as
well
as
such
a
degree
of
disease
generally
in
the
crop
of
hops
near
maidstone
that
he
was
determined
to
make
a
peregrination
on
foot
through
the
gardens
in
all
the
hop
districts
in
kent
and
sussex
he
carried
his
determination
into
effect
and
having
made
such
observations
as
led
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
a
very
short
crop
he
made
large
purchases
of
the
growers
to
be
delivered
at
a
certain
price
when
picked
this
was
called
bargains
and
was
the
invariable
custom
of
transacting
business
between
the
farmers
and
the
factors
waddington
then
started
into
worcestershire
and
having
made
a
similar
survey
of
the
growing
crops
in
that
county
and
having
come
to
a
similar
conclusion
he
made
large
purchases
also
upon
the
same
terms
as
he
had
done
in
kent
as
he
returned
through
london
he
called
upon
his
friend
tim
brown
and
in
the
true
spirit
of
friendship
he
communicated
to
him
the
result
of
his
travels
and
his
inspection
of
the
hop
gardens
both
in
kent
and
worcestershire
and
as
a
proof
of
his
conviction
that
there
would
be
a
short
crop
he
informed
him
of
the
large
purchases
which
he
had
made
and
added
that
he
should
still
increase
his
stock
as
the
season
approached
advising
at
the
same
time
his
friend
brown
by
all
means
to
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
old
hops
and
purchase
early
and
largely
of
new
mr
brown
affected
to
hold
waddington
information
very
cheap
and
in
fact
treated
his
advice
rather
with
ridicule
than
attention
at
length
picking
time
came
and
waddington
predictions
were
realised
to
the
very
letter
there
being
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
crop
grown
that
year
brown
had
not
only
failed
to
follow
his
advice
but
relying
upon
some
other
information
had
actually
neglected
to
lay
in
the
usual
stock
for
the
house
of
whitbread
waddington
rather
piqued
at
the
slight
put
upon
his
judgment
by
his
friend
brown
and
elated
with
his
own
success
sent
timothy
brown
a
goose
as
a
quiz
upon
him
for
his
want
of
discernment
and
lack
of
faith
in
his
representations
this
innocent
joke
which
i
understand
was
at
that
time
frequently
practised
by
speculating
men
in
the
city
so
enraged
brown
that
he
vowed
revenge
and
smarting
under
the
loss
of
not
having
had
the
foresight
to
purchase
his
hops
earlier
before
they
had
risen
a
hundred
per
cent
which
they
had
now
done
he
became
one
of
the
remorseless
persecutors
of
one
of
the
conspirators
to
prosecute
waddington
upon
an
obsolete
law
for
a
verdict
having
been
obtained
against
waddington
for
forestalling
in
herefordshire
and
being
about
to
be
tried
in
kent
the
prosecutors
moved
the
court
of
king
bench
to
remove
the
out
of
kent
upon
the
ground
that
the
farmers
were
prejudiced
so
much
in
favour
of
waddington
that
they
could
not
obtain
a
fair
jury
law
who
was
afterwards
lord
ellenborough
was
his
leading
counsel
and
upon
his
argument
and
the
authorities
which
he
cited
although
they
were
strongly
opposed
by
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
yet
as
the
prejudice
was
proved
lord
kenyon
upon
the
principle
that
the
administration
ought
not
only
to
be
pure
but
that
it
should
be
above
suspicion
made
the
rule
absolute
and
the
cause
was
tried
in
westminster
hall
by
a
middlesex
jury
it
was
mainly
upon
this
case
that
i
rested
my
application
for
the
court
to
remove
the
cause
of
the
king
against
hunt
and
nine
others
for
a
conspiracy
out
of
lancashire
into
yorkshire
the
middlesex
jury
was
however
as
tractable
as
that
in
the
country
and
he
had
a
second
verdict
against
him
for
which
he
was
sentenced
to
the
custody
of
the
marshal
of
the
king
bench
it
was
while
he
was
undergoing
his
sentence
that
as
i
have
already
mentioned
i
became
acquainted
with
him
and
i
passed
my
six
weeks
as
pleasantly
as
i
ever
passed
any
six
weeks
of
my
life
to
be
sure
it
put
me
to
a
great
expense
and
a
considerable
loss
in
taking
me
from
my
family
home
and
business
but
i
gained
more
real
information
more
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
men
and
manners
more
insight
into
mercantile
political
and
theological
affairs
than
i
should
have
gained
in
so
many
years
if
i
had
continued
in
the
country
employing
my
time
in
farming
shooting
fox
hunting
and
attending
to
the
exercise
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
it
is
more
than
probable
that
i
should
never
have
taken
the
lead
such
a
lead
in
the
political
affairs
of
my
country
if
i
had
not
thus
early
been
placed
in
such
a
situation
and
in
such
company
by
the
sentence
of
the
court
of
king
bench
before
that
period
i
had
it
is
true
a
natural
and
an
inherent
abhorrence
of
tyranny
and
oppression
and
my
excellent
parent
had
instilled
into
my
breast
a
pure
love
of
justice
and
an
invincible
attachment
for
fair
play
and
therefore
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
ever
have
been
a
tool
of
arbitrary
power
yet
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
circumstance
i
should
never
have
been
such
an
enthusiast
for
equal
rights
and
such
a
determined
enemy
to
a
corrupt
a
sham
representation
clifford
found
in
me
a
willing
a
zealous
proselyte
to
the
cause
of
rational
liberty
and
a
warm
admirer
of
the
principles
of
universal
political
freedom
he
recommended
to
my
notice
the
political
works
of
paine
particularly
his
of
and
applauded
my
determination
never
to
mingle
religious
with
political
discussions
and
never
to
risk
the
cause
of
liberty
by
doing
any
thing
which
could
excite
religious
prejudices
clifford
was
a
a
notwithstanding
which
there
never
lived
a
more
sincere
friend
of
religious
as
well
as
of
civil
toleration
some
of
our
party
were
frequently
introducing
theological
discussions
and
who
ought
from
their
profession
to
have
known
better
denounced
all
religion
as
relics
of
superstition
clifford
as
well
as
myself
and
waddington
discountenanced
and
ultimately
prohibited
those
subjects
we
each
professed
our
faith
and
we
did
not
choose
to
be
dictated
to
any
more
than
we
wished
to
dictate
to
others
in
matters
of
conscience
on
my
return
into
the
country
i
was
met
at
marlborough
by
my
friend
hancock
who
accompanied
me
to
devizes
where
we
were
joined
by
a
large
party
of
friends
at
a
dinner
which
was
provided
for
the
occasion
at
the
bear
inn
some
of
my
more
rustic
neighbours
expressed
great
surprise
to
see
me
look
so
well
after
coming
out
of
a
prison
their
idea
of
which
had
led
them
to
expect
to
see
me
look
and
on
the
contrary
they
found
that
i
had
lost
none
of
my
usual
ruddy
and
florid
appearance
and
instead
of
looking
as
if
i
had
been
fed
upon
bread
and
water
i
had
grown
stout
and
fleshy
although
i
had
taken
regular
exercise
and
compared
with
my
usual
habits
in
the
country
had
lived
moderately
and
in
fact
abstemiously
yet
with
all
my
precaution
i
had
so
much
increased
in
bulk
that
it
was
very
visible
to
all
my
friends
who
had
not
called
on
me
in
london
i
found
my
wife
and
children
in
perfect
health
and
they
warmly
greeted
my
return
in
fact
my
absence
was
nothing
more
than
passing
six
or
seven
weeks
in
london
i
found
all
my
business
going
on
with
great
regularity
my
stock
in
good
order
and
my
hunters
in
excellent
condition
and
as
i
longed
to
taste
again
the
sports
of
the
field
and
to
mingle
in
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
my
favourite
mare
was
ordered
to
be
ready
on
the
following
morning
at
the
usual
hour
that
i
might
ride
to
join
the
hounds
which
threw
off
for
the
occasion
within
three
miles
of
my
house
as
the
sportsmen
were
to
meet
upon
the
down
of
my
farm
at
widdington
here
i
met
my
old
brother
sportsmen
who
appeared
rejoiced
to
see
me
once
more
amongst
them
but
they
one
and
all
declared
that
my
scarlet
coat
was
grown
too
small
for
me
some
said
that
i
was
grown
a
stone
heavier
others
that
i
was
increased
two
stone
and
some
bets
were
made
corresponding
with
these
contending
opinions
all
however
agreed
that
i
was
increased
very
considerably
in
weight
like
a
true
sportsman
i
knew
my
weight
to
an
ounce
before
i
went
to
london
it
was
twelve
stone
five
pounds
in
the
midst
of
this
conversation
as
we
were
riding
along
i
espied
a
hare
sitting
at
a
considerable
distance
she
was
started
and
off
we
went
to
the
music
of
the
many
pack
of
harriers
supported
by
subscription
but
kept
by
tinker
of
lavington
i
was
more
than
commonly
elated
and
enjoyed
the
sport
with
great
pleasure
in
fact
i
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
chace
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
my
beautiful
high
bred
hunter
was
in
admirable
condition
and
spirits
and
appeared
to
participate
with
the
rider
in
the
full
zest
of
the
sport
she
almost
fled
with
me
across
the
downs
keeping
pace
with
the
fleetest
of
the
pack
the
hills
and
vallies
upon
that
part
of
salisbury
plain
very
much
resemble
those
of
sussex
in
the
neighbourhood
of
brighton
persons
unused
to
such
countries
would
consider
them
as
almost
precipices
our
horses
however
as
well
as
their
riders
being
accustomed
to
them
mounted
them
with
apparent
ease
and
generally
descended
them
at
full
speed
i
had
been
spanking
across
the
downs
for
nearly
an
hour
with
the
highest
glee
and
was
going
with
great
speed
down
the
well
known
steep
hill
which
leads
into
waterdean
bottom
pressing
on
my
mare
so
that
she
might
be
enabled
to
ascend
half
way
up
the
opposite
hill
by
the
force
of
the
increased
velocity
that
she
had
acquired
in
descending
the
other
which
is
the
common
practice
of
all
good
sportsmen
and
bold
riders
in
such
a
country
in
passing
with
great
speed
over
some
rather
uneven
rutty
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
received
a
violent
and
sudden
shock
by
my
poor
beast
coming
all
at
once
to
a
stand
still
i
jumped
off
without
her
falling
though
she
was
nearly
down
she
stood
trembling
and
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
she
had
both
of
her
fore
the
right
short
off
above
the
knee
and
the
other
below
the
fetlock
joint
this
was
a
most
distressing
accident
and
the
miracle
was
that
she
had
not
fallen
and
i
her
rider
been
smashed
in
the
fall
but
her
wonderful
courage
saved
me
from
almost
inevitable
destruction
for
we
were
going
at
the
time
with
the
velocity
of
an
arrow
shot
out
of
a
bow
the
other
horsemen
had
gone
on
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
and
i
was
left
in
this
situation
upon
the
open
down
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
my
home
seeing
the
deplorable
state
of
my
poor
horse
and
knowing
from
the
nature
of
the
injury
she
had
sustained
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
recover
her
i
determined
to
proceed
on
foot
to
my
home
that
i
might
send
some
proper
person
to
release
her
from
her
misery
and
i
had
gone
some
little
distance
on
my
road
when
on
looking
round
i
found
the
poor
creature
hobbling
after
me
indicating
that
it
was
her
wish
not
to
be
left
alone
and
abandoned
in
such
a
pitiable
state
my
heart
bled
for
my
faithful
and
noble
beast
and
i
instantly
attended
to
her
apparent
call
upon
my
humanity
i
took
the
rein
and
she
followed
me
home
nearly
as
fast
as
i
could
walk
when
we
reached
there
she
was
instantly
relieved
from
her
pain
by
the
last
sad
resource
the
fatal
unerring
ball
which
when
directed
by
a
skilful
hand
produces
instantaneous
death
without
a
groan
or
scarcely
a
convulsive
struggle
i
dropped
a
tear
when
she
had
breathed
her
last
consoled
only
by
the
reflection
that
my
life
had
been
spared
by
a
merciful
and
beneficent
creator
for
had
the
poor
animal
fallen
at
the
swift
pace
she
was
going
my
destruction
must
have
been
inevitable
what
is
very
remarkable
i
never
before
or
since
ever
knew
a
horse
break
its
legs
when
going
at
full
speed
without
falling
but
this
noble
animal
in
the
struggle
in
the
amazing
effort
to
save
herself
from
falling
when
the
bone
of
her
right
leg
snapped
actually
fractured
the
other
i
had
the
fractured
bones
of
both
legs
preserved
for
the
inspection
of
the
curious
for
many
years
afterwards
this
sad
accident
was
a
great
drawback
to
the
pleasure
that
i
had
promised
myself
in
the
chase
during
the
spring
of
the
year
subsequent
to
my
return
from
the
king
bench
and
to
add
to
my
mortification
and
disappointment
the
first
time
i
mounted
my
next
greatest
favourite
hunter
i
found
that
it
was
brokenwinded
i
had
lent
her
during
my
in
for
it
is
a
farce
to
call
it
imprisonment
to
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
tompkins
who
lived
at
oakley
house
near
abingdon
and
he
had
returned
it
in
the
state
which
i
have
described
so
that
my
hunting
was
spoiled
for
that
season
upon
my
being
weighed
it
was
not
difficult
to
account
for
the
lamentable
fate
of
my
lost
favourite
i
found
that
i
had
increased
stone
two
during
my
six
weeks
comparative
inactivity
in
the
king
bench
for
although
i
had
taken
much
more
exercise
than
my
fellow
prisoner
waddington
yet
it
was
so
very
different
from
and
so
much
less
than
that
which
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
when
i
was
in
the
country
that
i
had
increased
in
size
and
weight
in
the
rapid
manner
which
i
have
described
and
to
this
increase
must
be
attributed
the
melancholy
accident
which
occurred
to
my
unfortunate
hunter
my
friend
tompkins
who
had
returned
my
other
hunter
in
consequence
of
his
servant
mismanagement
in
feeding
or
his
own
indiscreet
riding
upon
being
informed
of
the
circumstance
very
coolly
answered
that
he
was
sorry
for
it
and
in
the
true
stile
of
a
knowing
sportsman
he
proposed
to
accommodate
me
in
return
not
by
lending
me
one
of
his
hunters
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
but
by
selling
me
one
a
young
horse
as
he
said
of
great
power
and
promise
which
would
just
suit
me
and
as
a
great
favour
he
wrote
me
word
that
he
would
part
with
it
to
me
as
a
friend
at
the
same
price
which
he
had
given
for
it
he
invited
me
to
his
house
to
see
it
and
i
accepted
his
invitation
notwithstanding
his
not
knowing
of
his
intention
to
me
with
it
had
previously
informed
me
that
he
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
his
purchase
that
he
had
a
most
unfavourable
opinion
of
the
grey
horse
and
that
he
would
be
happy
to
part
with
him
at
a
loss
rather
than
not
get
rid
of
what
he
considered
as
a
very
bad
bargain
from
the
lady
description
of
the
horse
and
of
the
bad
qualities
for
which
tompkins
wished
to
dispose
of
him
i
had
however
formed
a
more
favourable
opinion
of
him
and
i
was
therefore
determined
to
trust
to
my
own
judgment
and
go
and
see
him
particularly
as
he
was
well
bred
i
accordingly
visited
oakley
for
the
purpose
and
without
one
word
of
higgling
i
gave
him
his
price
which
was
my
assuring
me
that
he
did
it
to
oblige
me
and
that
he
considered
himself
as
doing
me
no
small
favour
thus
had
this
sporting
friend
to
make
amends
for
the
loss
he
had
occasioned
me
by
breaking
the
wind
of
a
favourite
and
valuable
hunter
worth
little
less
than
a
hundred
guineas
palmed
upon
me
for
forty
guineas
as
a
pretended
boon
a
young
three
years
old
horse
which
he
did
not
think
would
ever
be
worth
sixpence
so
much
for
sporting
friendships
however
i
had
no
reason
to
repent
of
my
bargain
i
got
my
horse
into
condition
before
i
tried
him
and
he
turned
out
one
of
the
best
and
most
valuable
hunters
in
the
kingdom
to
the
great
mortification
of
my
envious
and
obliging
friend
for
early
in
the
next
season
when
he
was
only
four
years
old
the
honourable
george
bowes
the
brother
of
lord
strathmore
offered
me
three
hundred
guineas
for
him
i
however
never
parted
with
him
which
i
had
reason
to
repent
for
a
few
days
after
i
had
refused
five
hundred
guineas
for
him
my
friend
wm
butcher
horse
got
loose
in
my
stable
and
by
a
kick
broke
his
fore
leg
when
i
was
obliged
to
have
him
killed
and
so
ended
poor
oakley
i
was
rather
unlucky
in
my
sporting
acquaintance
as
will
be
seen
by
the
following
circumstance
soon
after
my
return
from
my
imprisonment
my
friend
wm
tinker
of
lavington
and
his
family
came
to
visit
me
after
dinner
amongst
other
things
that
i
was
relating
relative
to
what
had
occurred
during
my
stay
at
the
king
bench
i
mentioned
the
toast
that
was
usually
drank
first
by
the
prisoners
every
day
which
was
plaintiffs
in
prison
and
defendants
at
liberty
tinker
asked
whether
i
and
waddington
had
joined
in
this
toast
i
answered
yes
and
added
that
i
believed
it
was
the
first
toast
drank
every
day
after
dinner
this
she
set
down
at
once
for
a
very
disloyal
sentiment
because
my
nominal
plaintiff
or
prosecutor
was
the
king
against
hunt
and
she
consequently
pronounced
me
as
i
thought
in
a
mere
joke
to
be
a
disloyal
man
a
jacobin
in
this
opinion
of
hers
she
was
confirmed
by
learning
that
i
had
called
upon
colonel
despard
in
the
tower
and
hearing
me
inveigh
in
rather
warm
language
against
packed
juries
treacherous
lawyers
and
corrupt
judges
and
also
venturing
to
call
in
question
a
la
clifford
some
of
the
measures
of
the
minister
she
therefore
set
me
down
at
once
in
her
mind
as
a
rank
jacobin
and
as
the
sequel
will
prove
she
did
not
fail
to
act
upon
this
impression
for
about
a
month
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
my
only
paternal
aunt
to
say
that
tinker
had
informed
her
that
since
i
had
been
in
london
i
became
a
disloyal
man
and
that
i
had
actually
drank
at
my
own
table
the
most
disloyal
toast
wishing
the
king
to
be
imprisoned
all
my
forefathers
said
my
aunt
had
been
loyal
men
and
one
of
them
colonel
thomas
hunt
had
been
by
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
saved
from
losing
his
head
for
his
loyalty
to
king
charles
the
second
as
therefore
i
had
chosen
to
take
a
different
course
by
professing
different
principles
she
should
alter
her
will
and
leave
that
fortune
which
she
had
intended
for
me
to
some
other
persons
she
most
religiously
kept
her
word
though
in
my
reply
i
unequivocally
disclaimed
any
intention
of
offering
the
slightest
insult
to
the
king
or
saying
any
thing
that
could
without
the
most
wanton
misconstruction
be
deemed
disloyal
yet
i
claimed
the
right
to
think
for
myself
and
did
not
admit
that
because
i
professed
the
most
unbounded
loyalty
to
the
king
i
ought
to
pledge
myself
to
a
blind
subserviance
and
attachment
to
all
the
measures
of
his
ministers
all
that
i
could
urge
against
this
breach
of
confidence
in
betraying
nay
in
misrepresenting
a
conversation
at
my
own
table
and
the
malignity
of
tinker
motives
were
of
no
avail
although
this
aunt
died
without
any
children
and
i
was
her
nearest
of
kin
yet
she
made
my
quondam
friend
tinker
her
executor
and
never
left
me
a
shilling
the
reader
will
easily
conceive
that
this
neither
changed
my
politics
nor
increased
my
confidence
in
sporting
friends
the
fact
was
that
this
old
lady
was
an
illegitimate
daughter
of
my
grandfather
by
a
relation
of
this
tinker
whom
he
afterwards
married
my
grandfather
had
been
induced
to
leave
this
daughter
a
very
considerable
patrimony
at
the
suggestion
of
my
father
and
as
she
died
without
issue
it
would
have
been
only
an
act
of
justice
to
have
restored
the
money
to
its
lawful
source
but
the
kind
interference
of
tinker
has
sent
it
in
another
direction
and
i
sincerely
wish
it
may
prosper
with
those
who
have
obtained
it
i
envy
them
not
i
have
retained
my
opinions
and
they
have
got
the
cash
much
good
may
it
do
them
i
say
had
not
this
tinker
been
a
great
croney
of
hunt
the
connexion
would
have
ceased
from
this
time
i
was
however
always
very
cautious
what
i
said
afterwards
when
tinker
was
of
the
party
by
her
perversion
of
a
conversation
which
occurred
at
my
own
table
by
her
officious
misrepresentation
of
me
she
had
been
the
cause
of
my
losing
some
thousand
pounds
this
was
the
first
instance
in
which
i
experienced
the
serious
consequences
of
sporting
liberal
opinions
but
it
was
not
the
only
instance
in
which
this
good
lady
who
was
always
called
by
her
family
and
friends
from
her
very
motherly
habits
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
me
a
good
turn
in
the
same
way
another
elderly
lady
watts
of
lavington
who
had
voluntarily
made
her
will
and
left
me
property
and
estates
as
being
her
nearest
and
only
relation
upon
being
taken
ill
desired
that
i
should
be
sent
for
but
my
evil
spirit
tinker
who
was
a
neighbour
sent
for
another
lady
and
they
contrived
as
they
said
to
get
the
old
lady
to
her
in
her
last
moments
and
leave
her
property
away
from
me
to
other
persons
this
was
effected
in
such
and
such
a
and
such
that
i
should
have
disputed
the
will
had
i
not
been
afraid
of
exposing
a
relation
of
my
own
who
was
privy
and
instrumental
to
this
mysterious
transaction
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
old
lady
never
signed
her
name
although
she
wrote
a
most
excellent
and
legible
hand
this
precious
instrument
bearing
only
her
mark
and
the
maid
servant
who
attended
her
would
have
proved
quite
sufficient
to
have
set
aside
the
will
and
exposed
the
parties
concerned
but
as
one
of
them
was
a
very
near
relation
of
mine
and
one
whose
faults
i
have
always
been
anxious
to
conceal
and
palliate
rather
than
expose
and
condemn
i
put
up
with
the
loss
without
opposing
the
proof
of
the
will
there
is
one
fact
more
connected
with
this
case
which
i
will
state
to
show
to
what
extent
the
cruelty
of
some
persons
will
lead
them
when
they
wish
to
accomplish
a
bad
action
the
maid
informed
me
and
offered
to
swear
it
that
her
mistress
had
constantly
during
several
days
illness
expressed
the
most
urgent
desire
to
see
me
and
was
anxious
not
to
sign
or
to
do
any
thing
about
her
will
till
i
arrived
she
was
however
as
repeatedly
put
off
by
the
assurance
that
i
had
been
sent
for
and
did
not
choose
to
come
though
i
was
the
whole
time
at
home
at
a
distance
of
a
few
miles
and
never
received
the
slightest
intimation
of
her
illness
till
after
her
death
by
this
circumstance
i
may
with
great
fairness
reckon
myself
minus
about
five
thousand
pounds
so
that
the
politics
which
i
had
learned
in
the
king
bench
were
not
to
me
a
source
of
profit
but
on
the
contrary
had
proved
hitherto
most
detrimental
to
my
pecuniary
interests
but
thank
god
i
was
never
a
trading
politician
for
if
i
had
been
such
my
losses
would
have
very
soon
made
me
a
bankrupt
in
the
cause
at
this
time
however
though
the
sentiments
which
i
entertained
upon
public
matters
were
never
concealed
but
were
when
occasion
required
expressed
openly
and
without
reservation
i
attended
much
more
to
my
business
to
the
sports
of
the
field
and
to
my
own
pleasures
than
i
did
to
politics
my
farming
concerns
were
well
regulated
and
attended
to
though
i
spent
a
great
portion
of
my
time
in
and
shooting
and
likewise
kept
a
great
deal
of
company
scarcely
a
day
in
the
week
passed
that
i
was
not
out
at
a
party
or
had
one
at
my
own
house
but
much
more
frequently
at
home
this
period
i
consider
as
far
the
least
interesting
portion
of
my
life
i
kept
an
excellent
table
had
a
good
cellar
of
wine
and
there
was
never
any
lack
of
visitors
to
partake
of
it
the
old
adage
that
fools
make
feasts
and
wise
men
partake
of
them
i
can
not
refrain
from
acknowledging
to
have
been
pretty
much
realized
at
chisenbury
house
when
i
look
back
and
recollect
the
train
of
that
constantly
surrounded
my
table
amongst
the
number
of
whom
was
always
a
parson
or
two
i
am
induced
to
exclaim
in
the
language
of
solomon
it
was
all
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
my
life
was
a
scene
of
uninterrupted
gaiety
and
dissipation
one
continued
round
of
pleasure
i
had
barely
time
to
attend
to
my
own
personal
concerns
for
no
sooner
was
one
party
of
pleasure
ended
than
another
was
made
the
hounds
met
at
this
cover
at
that
and
so
on
through
the
week
dinners
balls
plays
hunting
shooting
fishing
and
driving
in
addition
to
my
large
farming
concerns
which
required
my
attendance
at
markets
and
fairs
and
which
business
i
never
neglected
even
in
this
heyday
of
levity
and
vanity
all
these
things
combined
left
me
no
leisure
to
think
or
reflect
and
scarcely
time
to
sleep
for
no
sooner
was
one
pleasure
or
amusement
ended
than
i
found
that
i
had
engaged
to
participate
in
another
and
i
joined
in
them
all
with
my
usual
enthusiasm
in
the
midst
of
all
this
giddy
round
of
mirth
and
folly
i
enjoyed
less
real
pleasure
and
satisfaction
than
i
had
done
at
any
former
period
of
my
life
i
saw
and
felt
that
there
was
little
sincerity
in
the
attachment
of
my
companions
for
there
was
no
real
friendship
in
their
hearts
though
they
would
praise
my
wine
admire
my
viands
and
bestow
the
most
unqualified
compliments
upon
the
liberality
with
which
they
were
dispensed
their
praise
on
this
score
was
certainly
merited
for
whether
it
was
a
dinner
party
or
a
ball
at
chisenbury
house
no
expense
or
trouble
was
spared
to
make
the
guests
happy
and
to
send
them
away
delighted
with
the
entertainment
what
a
scene
is
this
for
me
to
look
back
upon
i
might
be
said
to
have
got
into
the
whirlpool
into
the
very
vortex
of
endless
dissipation
and
folly
i
saw
and
felt
my
error
but
i
knew
not
how
to
retreat
my
wife
too
entered
into
the
very
marrow
of
this
round
of
pleasure
and
gay
society
the
means
to
support
all
this
were
never
wanting
for
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
landed
property
in
wilts
and
somerset
at
littlecot
and
glastonbury
of
the
value
of
upwards
of
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
besides
all
the
large
farming
business
which
my
father
had
left
me
there
was
therefore
no
deficiency
of
money
and
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
say
that
large
as
was
my
expenditure
i
took
care
never
to
live
fully
up
to
my
income
but
had
every
year
something
considerable
to
lay
by
or
to
assist
a
friend
with
fond
as
i
then
was
of
pleasure
no
man
attended
more
strictly
to
his
farming
business
than
i
did
and
the
farms
of
no
man
in
the
kingdom
were
managed
better
or
were
in
higher
condition
my
farms
at
that
time
were
like
gardens
and
much
cleaner
and
freer
from
weeds
than
most
gardens
and
i
had
the
best
flock
of
southdown
sheep
in
the
country
bearing
the
very
finest
fleeces
the
wool
of
which
i
sold
for
the
very
highest
price
in
the
kingdom
i
one
year
sold
my
wool
consisting
of
thousand
for
a
penny
a
pound
more
than
was
given
for
the
boasted
wool
shorn
from
the
flock
of
the
famous
elman
of
glind
in
sussex
when
at
an
agricultural
meeting
he
was
told
of
this
fact
he
very
coolly
answered
that
his
wool
was
most
decidedly
the
best
and
that
the
superiority
of
price
which
hunt
had
obtained
arose
merely
from
the
want
of
judgment
in
the
purchaser
this
question
was
however
set
at
rest
the
very
next
year
for
the
wool
dealer
who
had
purchased
elman
wool
having
heard
of
my
flock
came
all
the
way
out
of
sussex
from
the
neighbourhood
of
chichester
and
purchased
my
fleeces
at
a
pound
more
than
he
had
given
for
the
crack
sussex
wool
and
he
paid
for
the
carriage
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
into
the
bargain
after
this
elman
never
disputed
the
point
as
to
the
superior
quality
of
my
wool
i
mention
this
circumstance
merely
to
show
how
determined
i
was
to
excel
in
every
thing
which
i
undertook
at
least
that
i
did
every
thing
with
enthusiasm
i
afterwards
sold
eight
thousand
fleeces
at
once
to
some
manufacturers
dean
forsey
and
of
chard
in
this
county
at
the
highest
price
that
any
wool
sold
for
that
season
dean
subsequently
purchased
at
my
sale
that
he
might
have
some
of
the
stock
which
he
sold
to
me
again
when
i
called
upon
him
some
time
afterwards
out
of
this
circumstance
an
infamous
and
scurrilous
falsehood
was
propagated
in
the
columns
of
the
representing
me
as
having
swindled
my
friend
dean
out
of
a
flock
of
sheep
when
i
come
to
that
period
of
my
history
i
shall
fully
explain
the
affair
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
candid
person
and
i
shall
convince
every
honest
man
that
the
columns
of
the
have
been
made
the
vehicle
to
promulgate
the
most
barfaced
and
wanton
falsehood
against
me
to
serve
a
political
purpose
and
that
in
this
instance
the
has
never
been
exceeded
in
infamy
even
by
the
falsehoods
of
its
brother
in
london
in
the
year
i
grew
twelve
quarters
of
best
oats
per
acre
upon
eight
acres
of
poor
down
land
at
widdington
the
rent
of
which
was
not
more
than
ten
shillings
an
acre
they
were
sown
after
an
uncommonly
fine
crop
of
turnips
that
averaged
fifty
tons
to
an
acre
the
land
had
been
very
highly
manured
both
from
the
and
the
fold
for
the
turnips
which
had
been
hoed
three
times
it
was
the
heaviest
and
finest
crop
of
oats
that
i
ever
saw
and
they
stood
full
six
feet
high
in
the
straw
i
was
sitting
on
horseback
looking
on
while
they
were
mowing
them
and
i
recollect
that
when
thomas
airs
one
of
the
mowers
who
was
full
six
feet
high
swept
his
scythe
into
the
standing
corn
the
ears
of
the
oats
frequently
struck
his
hat
as
he
walked
along
it
was
very
fine
weather
and
they
were
carried
in
and
made
into
a
rick
by
themselves
without
taking
any
rain
in
the
spring
they
were
thrashed
out
and
all
sold
for
seed
at
three
pounds
a
quarter
now
as
they
averaged
twelve
quarters
an
acre
the
sale
amounted
to
pounds
an
acre
nearly
three
times
the
value
of
the
of
the
land
there
was
also
more
than
three
tons
of
straw
upon
each
acre
and
as
during
that
season
straw
sold
at
six
pounds
per
ton
the
actual
value
of
the
produce
taking
off
one
pound
a
ton
for
the
carriage
of
the
straw
was
per
acre
while
the
of
the
land
would
not
have
sold
for
per
acre
i
have
related
this
to
shew
what
enormous
profits
were
gained
by
good
farmers
at
those
times
about
this
period
it
was
that
the
late
lord
warwick
speaking
in
the
house
of
lords
of
the
state
of
insolence
to
which
the
farmers
had
arrived
and
alluding
to
their
extravagant
course
of
living
assured
his
right
honourable
hearers
that
some
of
them
had
reached
such
a
pitch
of
luxury
that
they
actually
drank
brandy
with
their
wine
this
caused
a
laugh
but
their
lordships
little
knew
how
literally
true
the
assertion
was
his
lordship
alluded
to
a
gentleman
farmer
of
the
name
of
jackson
who
lived
at
farm
in
the
county
of
warwick
and
who
then
always
took
brandy
with
his
wine
i
too
remember
a
humorous
farmer
and
a
very
worthy
fellow
of
the
name
of
mackerell
of
collingbourn
who
frequently
afterwards
did
the
same
thing
at
the
principal
market
room
at
the
bear
at
devizes
at
the
head
of
which
table
i
at
that
time
presided
every
week
mackerell
used
to
call
this
liquor
brandy
and
wine
lord
warwick
and
another
farmer
used
always
to
drink
a
nob
of
white
sugar
in
each
glass
of
claret
for
be
it
known
to
the
reader
that
i
have
repeatedly
seen
drank
at
that
table
on
a
market
day
by
twelve
or
fourteen
farmers
two
dozen
of
old
port
and
as
a
finish
two
dozen
of
claret
then
they
would
mount
their
chargers
and
off
they
would
go
in
a
body
each
of
them
with
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
and
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
the
poor
fellow
who
interrupted
them
or
failed
to
get
out
of
their
way
upon
their
road
home
no
set
of
men
ever
carried
their
heads
higher
than
they
did
no
set
of
men
were
ever
more
inflated
or
more
purse
proud
than
were
the
great
body
of
the
farmers
during
these
times
of
their
boundless
prosperity
for
many
years
the
average
price
of
wheat
was
fifteen
shillings
a
winchester
bushel
and
as
i
recollect
and
shall
never
forget
the
way
in
which
they
carried
themselves
during
these
halcyon
days
of
their
happy
fortune
i
should
like
much
to
have
a
peep
into
devizes
market
now
of
a
thursday
or
into
warminster
market
of
a
saturday
just
to
see
the
contrast
just
to
observe
how
they
look
and
how
they
conduct
themselves
now
they
are
selling
their
best
wheat
for
seven
shillings
a
bushel
which
is
less
than
half
the
former
price
while
the
rent
is
the
same
the
taxes
the
same
and
the
poor
rates
are
higher
instead
of
lower
at
that
period
it
only
took
me
a
hundred
sacks
of
wheat
to
pay
my
rent
of
widdington
farm
how
many
sacks
must
farmer
maslen
sell
now
to
pay
his
rent
of
the
same
farm
i
should
not
wonder
if
three
hundred
sacks
would
fall
short
of
paying
it
this
year
at
that
epoch
pocock
who
rented
enford
farm
of
benett
could
pay
his
and
for
the
sum
at
which
he
could
sell
sacks
of
wheat
the
present
tenant
fay
must
in
this
present
year
sell
sacks
of
wheat
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
his
and
what
a
falling
off
for
the
farmers
let
us
hope
that
they
will
display
somewhat
more
fortitude
and
patience
in
the
days
of
their
adversity
than
they
did
moderation
christian
forbearance
and
temper
in
their
days
of
prosperity
on
the
ninth
of
february
in
this
year
peace
was
signed
at
luneville
between
our
beloved
ally
austria
and
france
on
the
second
of
march
the
state
prisoners
were
liberated
some
of
whom
had
been
cruelly
confined
for
many
years
under
the
suspension
bill
and
on
the
seventeenth
of
march
there
was
a
complete
change
in
the
british
ministry
by
a
deep
juggle
of
pitt
who
resigned
he
and
his
colleagues
were
succeeded
by
addington
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
and
his
family
and
friends
on
the
sir
ralph
abercromby
was
killed
at
the
bloody
battle
of
alexandria
in
egypt
and
on
the
same
day
negociations
for
peace
were
entered
into
between
england
and
france
by
lord
hawkesbury
and
otto
on
the
second
of
april
the
danish
fleet
of
sail
anchored
off
copenhagen
was
all
taken
or
destroyed
by
lord
nelson
such
was
the
fury
of
the
battle
and
such
was
the
bravery
with
which
the
danes
defended
themselves
that
after
great
carnage
on
both
sides
some
of
the
english
ships
employed
on
the
occasion
were
nearly
silenced
by
the
batteries
nelson
perceiving
this
sent
in
a
flag
of
truce
and
offered
terms
which
the
danish
governor
accepted
on
the
nineteenth
the
habeas
corpus
suspension
act
and
the
seditious
act
passed
by
a
large
majority
in
both
houses
of
parliament
and
immediately
afterwards
the
ministerial
indemnity
bill
also
passed
on
the
sixth
of
may
the
famous
motion
was
made
by
lord
temple
the
present
marquis
of
buckingham
for
a
new
writ
for
old
sarum
to
exclude
horne
tooke
from
the
house
of
commons
he
having
been
elected
for
that
rotten
borough
by
lord
camelford
who
was
then
the
proprietor
of
it
the
ground
of
his
being
ineligible
to
sit
in
the
honourable
house
was
that
he
had
formerly
taken
priest
orders
this
fact
being
proved
a
law
was
passed
by
which
horne
tooke
was
excluded
from
sitting
in
future
lord
camelford
was
so
enraged
at
this
measure
that
he
threatened
to
return
his
black
servant
as
the
member
and
it
is
thought
he
would
have
actually
done
so
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
earnest
entreaties
of
lord
grenville
who
was
a
relation
of
lord
camelford
on
the
of
july
there
was
a
grand
review
of
the
volunteer
corps
in
hyde
park
the
number
assembled
was
four
thousand
eight
hundred
on
the
first
of
october
preliminary
articles
of
peace
fifteen
in
number
were
signed
between
england
and
france
by
lord
hawkesbury
and
otto
on
the
of
october
old
lauriston
arrived
in
london
with
the
ratifications
of
the
treaty
of
peace
between
great
britain
and
france
and
the
general
was
drawn
through
the
streets
by
the
populace
there
were
very
violent
debates
in
both
houses
of
parliament
against
the
preliminaries
of
peace
the
opposition
dissented
from
calling
it
a
glorious
peace
but
the
ministers
carried
it
by
very
large
majorities
during
this
year
the
price
of
bread
and
all
sorts
of
provisions
had
been
remarkably
high
at
one
period
the
quartern
loaf
sold
for
and
and
the
poor
suffered
very
much
throughout
the
country
the
great
mass
of
the
people
therefore
hailed
the
approach
of
peace
with
france
in
hopes
of
better
times
and
every
one
appeared
rejoiced
at
the
cessation
of
the
horrible
carnage
of
war
which
had
been
raging
with
so
much
violence
the
french
ministers
were
very
well
satisfied
with
the
court
of
james
who
had
at
last
formally
acknowledged
napoleon
as
the
head
of
the
french
government
although
there
were
many
amongst
the
opposition
who
denounced
the
preliminaries
as
a
hollow
truce
declaring
that
if
peace
was
concluded
upon
so
unsatisfactory
a
basis
and
so
disadvantageous
for
great
britain
the
english
government
would
soon
be
obliged
to
violate
the
treaty
which
must
lead
to
fresh
hostilities
i
for
one
sincerely
rejoiced
at
the
return
of
peace
for
i
had
long
been
convinced
that
the
war
was
carried
on
not
to
preserve
this
country
from
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
that
it
had
never
been
waged
for
any
of
its
avowed
purposes
that
it
had
from
the
beginning
been
a
war
against
the
principles
of
liberty
established
by
the
revolution
in
france
which
had
been
attacked
by
every
despotic
power
in
europe
every
one
of
which
powers
the
french
troops
had
under
the
banners
of
liberty
defeated
over
and
over
again
i
now
looked
upon
the
object
of
the
war
with
a
very
different
eye
from
what
i
had
formerly
done
and
i
took
a
more
correct
and
dispassionate
view
of
its
cause
and
the
intentions
of
those
who
first
declared
hostilities
than
what
i
did
when
i
first
enrolled
my
name
amongst
the
members
of
the
yeomanry
cavalry
i
had
now
had
time
to
reflect
the
six
weeks
which
i
had
passed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
king
bench
where
i
had
access
to
some
of
the
most
experienced
and
intelligent
men
in
the
kingdom
had
not
been
spent
in
vain
the
time
that
a
man
spends
in
a
prison
is
not
always
thrown
away
as
i
have
found
by
experience
and
i
shall
i
trust
be
able
to
prove
by
and
by
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
numerous
readers
that
the
time
i
have
spent
in
this
bastile
has
been
the
most
valuable
part
of
my
life
i
never
before
knew
what
real
leisure
was
i
have
enjoyed
retirement
as
much
as
any
man
in
england
but
then
i
have
been
always
surrounded
with
my
family
and
friends
i
have
never
before
now
known
what
it
was
to
have
seven
or
eight
hours
of
a
day
exclusively
to
myself
i
am
locked
up
in
solitary
confinement
in
my
dungeon
every
night
at
six
without
my
having
the
power
to
go
to
any
one
and
without
any
one
having
the
power
to
come
to
me
excepting
the
turnkey
which
thank
god
never
happens
now
after
time
though
it
used
to
be
the
case
very
frequently
when
i
first
came
here
it
is
considered
a
violation
of
the
rules
to
go
near
a
prisoner
unless
upon
a
great
emergency
after
he
is
locked
up
but
it
was
not
deemed
any
violation
of
rules
for
the
turnkey
to
be
constantly
coming
to
my
dungeon
and
with
an
authoritative
rattling
of
the
lock
of
the
door
marching
in
to
say
that
bridle
the
gaoler
wanted
a
newspaper
however
that
is
all
at
an
end
and
i
am
never
interrupted
i
can
sit
down
with
a
book
or
a
pen
at
six
almost
with
a
certainty
of
not
being
interrupted
by
any
living
creature
for
six
seven
or
eight
hours
at
a
time
my
keepers
think
this
the
greatest
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
upon
me
but
on
the
contrary
i
contrive
to
turn
their
malice
to
advantage
and
make
this
the
most
valuable
time
of
my
life
few
men
can
boast
such
a
luxury
i
really
enjoy
it
beyond
description
no
thanks
to
my
persecutors
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
when
they
read
this
which
i
know
they
all
will
if
they
were
to
devise
some
means
to
deprive
me
of
this
comfort
of
retirement
i
have
made
them
feel
and
i
will
continue
to
make
them
feel
that
though
i
expose
their
petty
tyranny
and
their
little
acts
of
meanness
towards
me
yet
that
my
mind
is
above
the
reach
of
their
vindictive
malice
i
understand
that
some
of
them
are
praying
for
the
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
that
they
may
have
me
delivered
over
to
their
power
that
i
may
be
left
to
their
unrestrained
will
to
inflict
torture
upon
me
in
secret
well
and
what
then
i
will
laugh
at
their
torture
and
make
them
painfully
conscious
of
their
own
insignificance
even
while
they
stand
over
me
and
inflict
it
when
i
was
in
the
king
bench
i
had
none
of
those
trials
my
time
passed
very
pleasantly
and
as
a
great
portion
of
it
passed
in
the
best
of
society
amongst
some
of
the
most
intelligent
men
of
the
age
my
time
was
not
thrown
away
i
was
induced
to
think
for
myself
and
to
form
my
own
opinion
of
public
men
and
public
measures
without
placing
as
i
had
hitherto
done
an
implicit
reliance
upon
the
opinions
of
others
whom
i
supposed
to
have
had
more
experience
and
better
means
of
judging
of
such
matters
than
i
had
i
began
not
only
to
think
but
to
act
for
myself
among
the
many
facts
that
i
ascertained
not
the
least
important
was
common
fame
was
a
common
clifford
had
brought
me
acquainted
with
all
the
tricks
frauds
and
deceptions
of
the
public
press
and
to
convince
me
that
almost
the
whole
of
the
public
press
of
that
day
was
venal
and
corrupt
he
proved
to
a
demonstration
by
some
that
for
a
any
thing
however
absurd
might
be
universally
promulgated
particularly
if
the
absurdity
was
in
favour
of
the
ruling
powers
for
instance
he
wrote
a
paragraph
the
greatest
hoax
that
ever
was
in
praise
of
the
mild
and
amiable
manners
the
courtesy
and
the
humanity
of
harry
dundas
now
said
he
to
show
you
how
this
will
be
promulgated
by
the
venal
press
and
how
it
will
be
swallowed
by
john
bull
give
me
and
i
will
put
it
into
the
hands
of
one
of
the
runners
for
collecting
information
for
the
papers
and
you
shall
see
it
in
all
the
newspapers
both
in
london
and
the
country
i
produced
the
immediately
and
out
it
came
in
one
of
the
morning
papers
the
next
day
and
as
he
had
predicted
it
was
copied
into
all
the
london
and
country
papers
thus
the
humanity
and
suavity
of
one
of
the
most
unfeeling
and
impudent
scotchmen
that
ever
crossed
the
tweed
was
cried
up
to
the
skies
and
he
was
eulogised
by
some
of
them
as
the
very
cream
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
then
as
to
public
opinion
and
the
popularity
of
the
leading
characters
of
the
day
fox
to
wit
clifford
has
a
hundred
times
declared
to
me
that
this
great
westminster
patriot
was
never
drawn
home
in
his
carriage
from
the
hustings
in
his
life
by
the
populace
without
the
persons
who
drew
him
being
regularly
and
for
it
the
price
was
always
to
be
divided
amongst
twenty
persons
a
shilling
and
each
person
clifford
assured
me
this
office
of
hiring
the
men
to
draw
their
candidates
home
was
frequently
allotted
to
him
and
that
it
was
invariably
the
same
with
horne
tooke
and
chamberlain
alias
john
wilkes
and
that
he
would
undertake
to
have
me
or
waddington
drawn
through
the
streets
of
london
from
whitechapel
to
piccadilly
for
the
same
sum
at
this
time
there
was
in
fact
very
little
disinterested
patriotism
amongst
the
working
classes
of
the
community
they
had
for
so
many
years
been
made
the
regular
dupes
of
those
who
were
called
the
opposition
members
of
parliament
without
that
faction
denominated
the
whigs
having
ever
done
any
essential
service
for
the
people
at
large
that
public
feeling
amongst
the
labouring
classes
of
mechanics
and
manufacturers
was
at
a
very
low
ebb
nor
is
this
to
be
at
all
wondered
at
because
none
not
one
of
these
great
leading
public
characters
ever
professed
to
accomplish
any
thing
that
would
openly
tangibly
and
immediately
give
any
political
rights
to
the
people
at
whenever
the
opposition
or
whigs
wished
to
oust
their
opponents
or
harrass
them
in
their
places
they
used
to
call
public
meetings
in
london
westminster
and
other
places
and
they
never
failed
to
get
the
multitude
to
pass
any
whig
resolutions
which
they
might
choose
to
submit
to
them
there
never
being
at
that
time
any
body
to
oppose
or
expose
their
factious
and
party
measures
the
people
in
london
and
westminster
always
supported
the
opposition
against
the
ministers
but
they
had
nevertheless
sense
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
no
direct
intention
in
the
opposition
to
render
any
immediate
or
effectual
benefit
to
the
people
whatever
the
whigs
promised
it
was
all
remote
and
in
perspective
it
can
not
therefore
excite
surprise
that
there
should
have
been
none
of
that
enthusiasm
which
has
been
so
evidently
manifested
by
the
people
within
the
last
seven
years
how
many
score
times
have
i
been
drawn
by
the
populace
and
yet
it
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
cost
me
or
any
of
my
friends
the
value
of
a
pot
of
porter
for
any
thing
of
the
sort
it
is
easy
to
account
for
this
alteration
in
the
popular
feeling
the
change
has
been
brought
about
in
consequence
of
myself
and
those
who
have
acted
with
me
having
openly
avowed
our
determination
to
endeavour
to
obtain
for
the
people
equal
political
rights
which
will
lead
to

but
to
return
to
my
narrative
i
was
now
living
in
the
zenith
of
thoughtlessness
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
it
by
so
mild
an
appellation
i
had
a
large
income
and
i
contrived
to
live
nearly
though
not
quite
up
to
it
by
keeping
a
great
deal
of
expensive
company
and
an
expensive
establishment
both
within
and
without
doors
in
all
this
my
wife
fully
participated
but
i
attribute
no
blame
to
her
for
this
it
was
business
and
my
duty
to
know
better
and
to
act
otherwise
there
is
no
excuse
for
me
as
i
did
know
that
i
was
leading
what
might
be
fairly
and
justly
called
a
dissolute
life
i
do
not
mean
to
admit
that
there
was
any
thing
which
is
generally
termed
criminal
in
my
conduct
but
i
must
say
if
i
tell
the
truth
which
i
am
determined
to
do
at
all
hazards
that
i
led
a
very
dissipated
existence
when
i
look
back
soberly
and
divest
myself
of
fashionable
prejudices
i
can
not
conscientiously
call
it
by
any
milder
name
in
fact
though
my
habits
at
that
period
were
similar
to
those
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
fashionable
families
in
the
country
who
are
looked
upon
as
most
respectable
and
correct
people
i
can
not
look
back
but
with
regret
upon
the
manner
in
which
i
spent
this
most
valuable
portion
of
my
time
hunting
shooting
coursing
or
fishing
all
day
and
every
day
and
then
at
night
instead
of
passing
it
with
my
family
and
children
in
the
calm
serene
delightful
joys
of
a
domestic
and
rational
fireside
i
had
always
a
large
party
at
home
or
made
one
amongst
the
number
at
a
friend
house
seldom
were
we
in
bed
till
two
or
three
in
the
morning
the
next
day
brought
sporting
and
the
next
night
a
ball
or
a
card
party
or
a
drinking
party
and
thus
i
was
hurried
from
one
scene
of
dissipation
to
another
without
ever
allowing
myself
time
scarcely
to
look
round
seldom
to
look
back
and
never
seriously
to
reflect
it
was
with
me
even
in
dissipation
as
it
was
in
every
thing
else
that
i
engaged
in
that
i
was
enthusiastic
in
this
record
of
my
errors
and
failings
the
reader
must
therefore
prepare
himself
to
hear
at
any
rate
of
some
thumping
faults
and
although
i
do
not
deserve
and
do
not
expect
to
escape
the
deep
censure
of
some
yet
i
rely
upon
the
liberal
indulgence
of
the
more
virtuous
portion
of
the
community
who
know
that
it
is
the
lot
of
man
to
err
but
that
it
is
godlike
to
make
allowances
for
human
infirmities
and
to
forgive
them
and
after
relating
all
my
errors
i
shall
boldly
say
in
the
language
of
our
saviour
let
him
that
is
without
fault
cast
the
first
stone
in
the
midst
of
this
life
of
thoughtless
gaiety
and
pleasure
i
was
always
greatly
attached
to
female
society
and
i
gave
the
preference
to
those
amusements
where
females
were
of
the
party
such
as
dancing
music
and
those
card
parties
where
they
could
join
in
consequence
of
this
i
frequently
escaped
those
bacchanalian
carousals
to
which
many
of
my
intimate
friends
and
companions
were
strongly
addicted
not
that
i
mean
to
pretend
that
when
i
made
one
of
those
parties
i
ever
flinched
no
i
took
my
bottle
as
freely
as
any
of
them
but
thanks
to
a
good
constitution
never
to
excess
or
rather
never
so
as
to
become
inebriated
dancing
i
enjoyed
and
participated
in
to
excess
my
partiality
to
female
society
led
me
into
many
extravagancies
and
into
some
difficulties
for
i
could
not
pay
moderate
attention
to
a
lady
my
partner
if
i
admired
her
received
my
enthusiastic
attention
for
though
i
was
a
married
man
yet
i
suffered
no
single
man
to
outdo
me
in
polite
assiduities
to
my
partner
this
sometimes
drew
down
upon
me
the
anger
and
upon
one
occasion
the
unjust
suspicion
of
hunt
a
young
lady
who
was
upon
a
visit
in
our
family
had
attracted
my
particular
notice
she
was
handsome
elegant
lively
and
fascinating
and
i
was
at
first
led
to
pay
her
more
marked
respect
because
i
discovered
that
it
excited
the
envy
of
a
widow
lady
of
andover
who
came
with
her
on
a
visit
to
our
house
she
like
many
of
her
fellows
because
she
never
possessed
any
of
those
personal
charms
or
acquired
accomplishments
that
please
all
who
come
within
the
reach
of
their
influence
was
uncommonly
envious
of
those
who
did
and
setting
herself
up
as
a
sort
of
duenna
to
this
young
lady
undertook
to
take
her
to
task
for
receiving
with
so
much
ease
and
unconcern
my
extremely
marked
attention
which
she
declared
made
my
wife
very
this
was
at
that
moment
a
barefaced
falsehood
of
the
old
hag
though
she
contrived
afterwards
by
her
arts
insinuations
and
fabrications
to
produce
that
effect
in
the
breast
of
hunt
the
old
widow
whom
i
shall
for
convenience
sake
call
butler
at
first
was
successful
in
thwarting
as
she
said
her
young
friend
amusement
and
in
rendering
miserable
the
person
whom
she
affected
to
pity
but
at
last
by
carrying
her
calumnies
too
far
she
failed
altogether
in
her
diabolical
schemes
for
having
represented
to
hunt
that
she
had
seen
me
take
a
gross
and
indecent
liberty
with
the
young
lady
the
falsehood
struck
my
wife
so
forcibly
that
the
object
of
it
was
very
visible
even
to
her
jaundiced
eye
and
without
ceremony
she
ordered
her
carriage
and
packed
the
slanderer
off
to
her
own
home
very
properly
forbidding
her
ever
entering
her
door
again
though
my
wife
behaved
with
becoming
spirit
upon
this
occasion
by
banishing
such
a
fiend
in
human
form
from
her
house
yet
the
latent
sparks
of
jealousy
which
had
been
lodged
in
her
breast
were
still
too
visible
to
be
concealed
i
was
stung
by
being
subject
to
such
unjust
suspicions
and
instead
of
taking
the
prudent
and
proper
course
conscious
of
the
purity
and
innocence
of
my
feelings
with
respect
to
our
young
visitor
i
continued
nay
redoubled
my
zealous
devotion
instead
of
healing
the
breach
that
this
fracas
had
made
i
braved
it
out
and
what
before
was
only
the
polite
attention
which
i
was
always
in
the
habit
of
paying
to
an
interesting
female
became
now
to
all
outward
appearance
an
enthusiastic
attachment
unfortunately
too
the
young
lady
feeling
indignant
at
the
groundless
and
unjust
ideas
of
hunt
too
readily
fell
into
my
views
and
appeared
to
be
very
much
pleased
with
my
open
and
increased
assiduities
this
added
fuel
to
the
fire
it
led
to
the
most
unpleasant
consequences
and
laid
the
foundation
for
those
little
bickerings
which
are
too
apt
to
create
at
length
a
mutual
indifference
however
after
having
braved
the
affair
out
for
a
few
days
the
young
lady
returned
amongst
her
friends
who
had
the
sincerity
and
candour
to
represent
to
her
the
imprudence
of
her
conduct
and
this
flirtation
which
was
so
innocent
in
fact
but
so
injurious
in
its
result
was
at
once
put
an
end
to
i
have
related
this
seemingly
uninteresting
affair
first
to
shew
and
admit
the
folly
of
which
i
was
guilty
for
folly
it
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
and
next
as
a
warning
to
my
young
readers
to
avoid
the
rock
of
tampering
with
and
irritating
the
feelings
of
those
whom
they
ought
to
love
and
cherish
i
sincerely
believe
if
a
man
once
excites
jealousy
in
the
breast
of
his
wife
whether
well
founded
or
not
the
virus
that
it
engenders
is
of
such
a
corroding
nature
that
it
is
seldom
if
ever
totally
eradicated
married
persons
therefore
can
never
be
too
circumspect
in
their
conduct
though
i
never
offered
the
most
distant
insult
or
ever
took
even
the
most
innocent
liberty
with
this
young
lady
yet
i
admit
that
i
was
guilty
of
an
act
of
gross
and
wanton
imprudence
i
was
guilty
of
great
injustice
to
the
young
lady
and
of
greater
injustice
to
hunt
and
i
feel
at
this
moment
that
to
induce
the
reader
to
forgive
this
faulty
part
of
my
conduct
will
require
a
considerable
portion
of
liberality
and
good
nature
and
of
that
amiable
christian
virtue
which
teaches
a
person
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
to
look
with
charity

the
