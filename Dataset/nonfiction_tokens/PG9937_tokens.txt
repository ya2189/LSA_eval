soup
and

value
of
soup
soup
is
a
liquid
food
that
is
prepared
by
boiling
meat
or
vegetables
or
both
in
water
and
then
seasoning
and
sometimes
thickening
the
liquid
that
is
produced
it
is
usually
served
as
the
first
course
of
a
dinner
but
it
is
often
included
in
a
light
meal
such
as
luncheon
while
some
persons
regard
the
making
of
soup
as
difficult
nothing
is
easier
when
one
knows
just
what
is
required
and
how
to
proceed
the
purpose
of
this
section
therefore
is
to
acquaint
the
housewife
with
the
details
of
soup
making
so
that
she
may
provide
her
family
with
appetizing
and
nutritious
soups
that
make
for
both
economy
and
healthfulness
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
advancement
that
has
been
made
with
this
food
the
origin
of
soup
like
that
of
many
foods
dates
back
to
practically
the
beginning
of
history
however
the
first
soup
known
was
probably
not
made
with
meat
for
instance
the
mess
of
pottage
for
which
esau
sold
his
birthright
was
soup
made
of
red
lentils
later
on
meat
came
to
be
used
as
the
basis
for
soup
because
of
the
agreeable
and
appetizing
flavor
it
provides
then
at
one
time
in
france
a
scarcity
of
butter
and
other
fats
that
had
been
used
to
produce
moistness
and
richness
in
foods
brought
about
such
clear
soups
as
bouillon
and
consommé
these
as
well
as
other
liquid
foods
found
much
favor
for
about
the
time
they
were
devised
it
came
to
be
considered
vulgar
to
chew
food
thus
at
various
periods
and
because
of
different
emergencies
particular
kinds
of
soup
have
been
introduced
until
now
there
are
many
kinds
from
which
the
housewife
may
choose
when
she
desires
a
dish
that
will
start
a
meal
in
the
right
way
and
at
the
same
time
appeal
to
the
appetite
value
of
soup
in
the
not
all
persons
have
the
same
idea
regarding
the
value
of
soup
as
a
part
of
a
meal
some
consider
it
to
be
of
no
more
value
than
so
much
water
claiming
that
it
should
be
fed
to
none
but
children
or
sick
persons
who
are
unable
to
take
solid
food
on
the
other
hand
many
persons
believe
that
soup
contains
the
very
essence
of
all
that
is
nourishing
and
sustaining
in
the
foods
of
which
it
is
made
this
difference
of
opinion
is
well
demonstrated
by
the
ideas
that
have
been
advanced
concerning
this
food
some
one
has
said
that
soup
is
to
a
meal
what
a
portico
is
to
a
palace
or
an
overture
to
an
opera
while
another
person
who
evidently
does
not
appreciate
this
food
has
said
that
soup
is
the
preface
to
a
dinner
and
that
any
work
really
worth
while
is
sufficient
in
itself
and
needs
no
preface
such
opinions
however
must
be
reconciled
if
the
true
value
of
this
food
is
to
be
appreciated
probably
the
best
way
in
which
to
come
to
a
definite
conclusion
as
to
the
importance
of
soup
is
to
consider
the
purposes
it
serves
in
a
meal
when
its
variety
and
the
ingredients
of
which
it
is
composed
are
thought
of
soup
serves
two
purposes
first
as
an
appetizer
taken
at
the
beginning
of
a
meal
to
stimulate
the
appetite
and
aid
in
the
flow
of
digestive
juices
in
the
stomach
and
secondly
as
an
actual
part
of
the
meal
when
it
must
contain
sufficient
nutritive
material
to
permit
it
to
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
meal
instead
of
merely
an
addition
even
in
its
first
and
minor
purpose
the
important
part
that
soup
plays
in
many
meals
is
not
hard
to
realize
for
it
is
just
what
is
needed
to
arouse
the
flagging
appetite
and
create
a
desire
for
nourishing
food
but
in
its
second
purpose
the
real
value
of
soup
is
evident
whenever
soup
contains
enough
nutritive
material
for
it
to
take
the
place
of
some
dish
that
would
otherwise
be
necessary
its
value
can
not
be
overestimated
if
soup
is
thought
of
in
this
way
the
prejudice
that
exists
against
it
in
many
households
will
be
entirely
overcome
but
since
much
of
this
prejudice
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
soup
served
is
often
unappetizing
in
both
flavor
and
appearance
sufficient
attention
should
be
given
to
the
making
of
soup
to
have
this
food
attractive
enough
to
appeal
to
the
appetite
rather
than
discourage
it
soup
should
not
be
greasy
nor
insipid
in
flavor
neither
should
it
be
served
in
large
quantities
nor
without
the
proper
accompaniment
a
small
quantity
of
attractively
served
soup
can
not
fail
to
meet
the
approval
of
any
family
when
it
is
served
as
the
first
course
of
the
meal
general
classes
of
soups
are
named
in
various
ways
according
to
material
quality
etc
but
the
two
purposes
for
which
soup
is
used
have
led
to
the
placing
of
the
numerous
kinds
into
two
general
classes
in
the
first
class
are
grouped
those
which
serve
as
appetizers
such
as
bouillon
consommé
and
some
other
broths
and
clear
soups
in
the
second
class
are
included
those
eaten
for
their
nutritive
effect
such
as
cream
soups
purées
and
bisques
from
these
two
classes
of
soup
the
one
that
will
correspond
with
the
rest
of
the
meal
and
make
it
balance
properly
is
the
one
to
choose
for
instance
a
light
soup
that
is
merely
an
appetizer
should
be
served
with
a
heavy
dinner
whereas
a
heavy
highly
nutritious
soup
should
be
used
with
a
luncheon
or
a
light
meal
economic
value
of
besides
having
an
important
place
in
the
meal
of
which
it
forms
a
part
soup
is
very
often
an
economy
for
it
affords
the
housewife
a
splendid
opportunity
to
utilize
many
with
the
french
people
who
excel
in
the
art
of
soup
making
chiefly
because
of
their
clever
adaptation
of
seasoning
to
foods
their
is
a
national
institution
and
every
kitchen
has
its
stock
pot
persons
who
believe
in
the
strictest
food
economy
use
a
stock
pot
since
it
permits
to
be
utilized
in
an
attractive
and
palatable
way
in
fact
there
is
scarcely
anything
in
the
way
of
fish
meat
fowl
vegetables
and
cereals
that
can
not
be
used
in
soup
making
provided
such
ingredients
are
cared
for
in
the
proper
way
very
often
the
first
glance
at
the
large
number
of
ingredients
listed
in
a
soup
recipe
creates
the
impression
that
soup
must
be
a
very
complicated
thing
such
however
is
not
the
case
in
reality
most
of
the
soup
ingredients
are
small
quantities
of
things
used
for
flavoring
and
it
is
by
the
proper
blending
of
these
that
appetizing
soups
are
secured
classification
of
soups
the
two
general
classes
of
soup
already
mentioned
permit
of
numerous
methods
of
classification
for
instance
soups
are
sometimes
named
from
the
principal
ingredient
or
an
imitation
of
it
as
the
names
potato
soup
beef
soup
macaroni
soup
soup
testify
again
both
stimulating
and
nutritious
soups
may
be
divided
into
thin
and
thick
soups
thin
soups
usually
being
clear
and
thick
soups
because
of
their
nature
cloudy
when
the
quality
of
soups
is
considered
they
are
placed
in
still
different
classes
and
are
called
broth
bisque
consommé
purée
and
so
on
another
important
classification
of
soups
results
from
the
nationality
of
the
people
who
use
them
while
soups
are
classified
in
other
ways
it
will
be
sufficient
for
all
practical
purposes
if
the
housewife
understands
these
three
principal
classes
classes
denoting
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
soups
are
of
only
two
kinds
when
their
consistency
is
thought
of
namely
and
clear
soups
are
those
made
from
carefully
cleared
stock
or
soup
foundation
and
flavored
or
garnished
with
a
material
from
which
the
soup
usually
takes
its
name
there
are
not
many
soups
of
this
kind
and
being
the
two
leading
varieties
but
in
order
to
be
palatable
they
require
considerable
care
in
making
thick
soups
are
also
made
from
stock
but
milk
cream
water
or
any
mixture
of
these
may
also
be
used
as
a
basis
and
to
it
may
be
added
for
thickening
meat
fish
vegetables
eggs
or
grain
or
some
other
starchy
material
soups
of
this
kind
are
often
made
too
thick
and
as
such
soups
are
not
appetizing
care
must
be
taken
to
have
them
just
right
in
consistency
classes
denoting
when
attention
is
given
to
the
quality
of
soup
this
food
divides
itself
into
several
varieties
namely
cream
soup
bisque
chowder
and
broths
have
for
their
foundation
a
clear
stock
they
are
sometimes
a
thin
soup
but
other
times
they
are
made
quite
thick
with
vegetables
rice
barley
or
other
material
when
they
are
served
as
a
substantial
part
of
a
meal
cream
soups
are
highly
nutritious
and
are
of
great
variety
they
have
for
their
foundation
a
thin
cream
sauce
but
to
this
are
always
added
vegetables
meat
fish
or
grains
bisques
are
thick
rich
soups
made
from
game
fish
or
shell
fish
particularly
crabs
shrimp
etc
occasionally
vegetables
are
used
in
soup
of
this
kind
chowders
are
soups
that
have
sea
food
for
their
basis
vegetables
and
crackers
are
generally
added
for
thickening
and
to
impart
flavor
purées
are
soups
made
thick
partly
or
entirely
by
the
addition
of
some
material
obtained
by
boiling
an
article
of
food
and
then
straining
it
to
form
a
pulp
when
vegetables
containing
starch
such
as
beans
peas
lentils
and
potatoes
are
used
for
this
purpose
it
is
unnecessary
to
thicken
the
soup
with
any
additional
starch
but
when
meat
fish
or
watery
vegetables
are
used
other
thickening
is
required
to
be
right
a
purée
should
be
nearly
as
smooth
as
thick
cream
and
of
the
same
consistency
classes
typical
of
particular
certain
kinds
of
soup
have
been
made
so
universally
by
the
people
of
various
countries
that
they
have
come
to
be
regarded
as
national
dishes
and
are
always
thought
of
as
typical
of
the
particular
people
by
whom
they
are
used
among
the
best
known
of
these
soups

a

used
by
the
russian
people

order
that
processes
may
be
readily
grasped
by
the
housewife
she
should
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
what
is
meant
by
which
forms
the
foundation
of
many
soups
in
looking
into
the
derivation
of
this
term
it
will
be
found
that
the
word
stock
comes
from
an
word
meaning
to
stick
and
that
while
it
has
many
different
uses
the
idea
of
fixedness
is
expressed
in
every
one
of
them
as
is
generally
known
a
stock
of
anything
means
a
reserve
supply
of
that
thing
stored
away
for
future
use
when
applied
to
soup
stock
is
similar
in
meaning
for
it
refers
to
material
stored
or
prepared
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
be
kept
for
use
in
the
making
of
certain
kinds
of
soup
in
a
more
definite
sense
soup
stock
may
be
regarded
as
a
liquid
containing
the
juices
and
soluble
parts
of
meat
bone
and
vegetables
which
have
been
extracted
by
long
slow
cooking
and
which
can
be
utilized
in
the
making
of
soups
sauces
and
gravies
soups
in
which
stock
is
utilized
include
all
the
varieties
made
from
beef
veal
mutton
and
poultry
if
clear
stock
is
desired
for
the
making
of
soup
only
fresh
meat
and
bones
should
be
used
and
all
material
that
will
discolor
the
liquid
in
any
way
carefully
avoided
for
ordinary
unclarified
soups
the
trimmings
and
bones
of
roast
steak
or
chops
and
the
carcass
of
fowl
can
generally
be
utilized
however
very
strongly
flavored
meat
such
as
mutton
or
the
fat
from
mutton
should
be
used
sparingly
if
at
all
on
account
of
the
strong
flavor
that
it
imparts
varieties
of
several
kinds
of
stock
are
utilized
in
the
making
of
soup
and
the
kind
to
employ
depends
on
the
soup
desired
in
determining
the
kind
of
stock
required
for
the
foundation
of
a
soup
the
housewife
may
be
guided
by
the
following
classification
first
stock
is
made
from
meat
and
bones
and
then
clarified
and
used
for
clear
soups
second
stock
is
made
from
the
meat
and
the
bones
that
remain
after
the
first
stock
is
strained
off
more
water
is
added
to
the
remaining
material
and
this
is
then
cooked
with
vegetables
which
supply
the
needed
flavor
such
stock
serves
very
well
for
adding
flavor
to
a
nutritious

from
vegetables
or
cereal

stock
is
made
by
cooking
meat
and
bones
either
fresh
or
cooked
with
vegetables
or
other
material
that
will
impart
flavor
and
add
nutritive
value
stock
of
this
kind
is
used
for
ordinary
soups

stock
is
made
from

however
may
be
utilized
in
many
other
ways

especially
valuable

any
bits
of
meat
or
fowl
that
are
left
over
can
be
made
into
an
appetizing
dish
by
adding
thickened
stock
to
them
and
serving
the
combination
over
toast
or
rice
in
fact
a
large
variety
of
made
dishes
can
be
devised
if
there
is
stock
on
hand
to
add
for
flavor
the
convenience
of
a
supply
of
stock
will
be
apparent
when
it
is
realized
that
gravy
or
sauce
for
almost
any
purpose
can
be
made
from
the
contents
of
the
stock
pot

if
a
housewife
does
not
have
sufficient
time
to
go
through
the
various
processes
involved
in
making
soup
her
family
need
not
be
deprived
of
this
article
of
diet
for
there
are
a
number
of
concentrated
meat
and
vegetable
extracts
on
the
market
for
making
soups

made
of
the
same
flavoring
material
as
that
which
is
drawn
from
meat
in
the
making
of
stock
almost
all
the
liquid
is
evaporated
and
the
result
is
a
thick
dark
substance
that
must
be
diluted
greatly
with
water
to
obtain
the
basis
for
a
soup
or
a
broth
some
of
the
extracts
such
as
japanese
soy
and
english
marmite
are
so
similar
in
appearance
and
taste
to
the
meat
extracts
as
to
make
it
quite
difficult
to
detect
any
difference
both
varieties
of
these
extracts
may
be
used
for
sauces
and
gravies
as
well
as
for
soups

it
should
be

principal
ingredients
the
making
of
the
stock
that
is
used
in
soup
is
the
most
important
of
the
processes
in
fact
these
two
things
soup
and
stock
may
be
regarded
in
many
instances
as
one
and
the
same
the
housewife
will
do
well
therefore
to
keep
in
mind
that
whenever
reference
is
made
to
the
making
of
soup
usually
stock
making
is
also
involved
and
meant
before
the
actual
processes
are
taken
up
however
the
nature
of
the
ingredients
required
should
be
well
understood
for
this
reason
suitable
meats
and
vegetables
which
are
the
principal
ingredients
in
soups
are
first
discussed
meat
used
for
soup
with
the
exception
of
pork
almost
every
kind
of
meat
including
beef
veal
mutton
lamb
game
and
poultry
is
used
for
soup
making
occasionally
ham
is
employed
but
most
other
forms
of
pork
are
seldom
used
to
any
extent
when
soup
stock
is
made
from
these
meats
they
may
be
cooked
separately
or
as
a
combination
is
often
an
improvement
over
a
single
variety
several
kinds
may
be
combined
for
instance
mutton
used
alone
makes
a
very
strongly
flavored
soup
so
that
it
is
usually
advisable
to
combine
this
kind
of
meat
with
another
meat
that
has
a
less
distinctive
flavor
on
the
other
hand
veal
alone
does
not
have
sufficient
flavor
so
it
must
be
combined
with
lamb
game
fowl
or
some
other
meat
certain
cuts
of
meats
are
preferred
to
others
in
the
making
of
soups
because
of
the
difference
in
their
texture
the
tender
cuts
which
are
the
expensive
ones
should
not
be
used
for
soups
as
they
do
not
produce
enough
flavor
the
tough
cuts
which
come
from
the
muscles
that
the
animal
uses
constantly
and
that
therefore
grow
hard
and
tough
are
usually
cheaper
but
they
are
more
suitable
because
they
contain
the
material
that
makes
the
best
soup
the
pieces
best
adapted
to
soup
making
are
the
shins
the
shanks
the
lower
part
of
the
round
the
neck
the
flank
the
shoulder
the
tail
and
the
brisket
the
parts
of
the
animal
from
which
these
cuts
are
taken
are
clearly
shown
in
fig
although
beef
is
obtained
from
the
animal
shown
the
same
cuts
come
from
practically
the
same
places
in
other
animals
stock
made
from
one
of
these
cuts
will
be
improved
if
a
small
amount
of
the
fat
of
the
meat
is
cooked
with
it
but
to
avoid
soup
that
is
too
greasy
any
excess
fat
that
remains
after
cooking
should
be
carefully
removed
the
marrow
of
the
shin
bone
is
the
best
fat
for
soup
making
if
soup
is
to
be
made
from
fish
a
white
variety
should
be
selected
the
head
and
trimmings
may
be
utilized
but
these
alone
are
not
sufficient
because
soup
requires
some
solid
pieces
of
meat
the
same
is
true
of
meat
bones
they
are
valuable
only
when
they
are
used
with
meat

equal
proportion
of

vegetables
used
for

housewife
has
also
a
large
number
of
vegetables
from
which
to
select
for
any
vegetable
that
has
a
decided
flavor
may
be
used
among
those
from

mushrooms
okra
and
even

these
vegetables
are
used
for
two
purposes
to
provide
flavoring
and
to
form
part
of
the
soup
itself
as
well
as
to
furnish
flavor
when
they
are
used
simply
for
flavoring
they
are
cooked

their
flavor
is
obtained
and
then
removed
from

they
are
to
form

as
to
impart

in
small
pieces

made
into

and
eaten
with

attention
too
must
be
given
to
the
condition
of
the
vegetables
that
are
used
in
soup
the
fresh
vegetables
that
are
used
should
be
in
perfect
condition
they
should
have
no
decayed
places
that
might
taint
or
discolor
the
soups
and
they
should
be
as
crisp
and
solid
as
possible
if
they
are
somewhat
withered
or
faded
they
can
be
freshened
by
allowing
them
to
stand
in
cold
water
for
a
short
time
when
dried
vegetables
are
to
be
used
for
soup
making
they
should
first
be
soaked
well
in
cold
water
and
then
before
being
added
to
the
stock
either
partly
cooked
or
entirely
cooked
and
made
into
a
purée
processes
involved
in
making
stock
although
the
making
of
stock
or
soup
is
a
simple
process
it
must
necessarily
be
a
rather
long
one
the
reason
for
this
is
that
all
flavor
can
not
be
drawn
from
the
soup
materials
unless
they
are
subjected
to
long
slow
cooking
at
a
temperature
lower
than
the
boiling
point
with
this
point
definitely
understood
the
actual
work
of
soup
making
may
be
taken
up
cooking
meat
for
when
clear
stock
is
to
be
made
from
fresh
meat
the
required
quantity
of
meat
should
be
cut
into
small
pieces
rather
than
large
ones
so
as
to
expose
as
much
of
the
surface
as
possible
from
which
the
flavor
of
the
meat
can
be
drawn
a
little
more
flavor
is
obtained
and
a
brown
color
developed
if
a
small
part
perhaps
a
fourth
of
the
pieces
of
meat
are
first
browned
in
the
frying
pan
the
pieces
thus
browned
together
with
the
pieces
of
fresh
meat
are
put
into
a
kettle
and
a
quart
of
cold
water
for
each
pound
of
meat
is
then
added
the
reason
for
using
cold
rather
than
hot
water
will
be
evident
when
the
action
of
water
on
raw
meat
is
understood
the
fiber
of
meat
is
composed
of
innumerable
tubes
containing
the
flavor
that
is
to
be
drawn
out
into
the
water
in
order
to
make
the
stock
appetizing
when
the
meat
is
cut
these
tiny
tubes
are
laid
open
putting
the
meat
thus
prepared
into
cold
water
and
allowing
it
to
heat
gradually
tend
to
extract
the
contents
of
the
tubes
this
material
is
known
as
and
it
contains
in
its
composition
stimulating
substances
on
the
other
hand
plunging
the
meat
into
hot
water
and
subjecting
it
quickly
to
a
high
temperature
will
coagulate
the
protein
in
the
tissue
and
prevent
the
extractives
from
leaving
the
tubes
to
obtain
the
most
flavor
from
meat
that
is
properly
prepared
it
should
be
put
over
a
slow
fire
and
allowed
to
come
gradually
to
the
boiling
point
as
the
water
approaches
the
boiling
point
a
scum
consisting
of
coagulated
albumin
blood
and
foreign
material
will
begin
to
rise
to
the
top
but
this
should
be
skimmed
off
at
once
and
the
process
of
skimming
continued
until
no
scum
remains
when
the
water
begins
to
boil
rapidly
either
the
fire
should
be
lowered
or
the
kettle
should
be
removed
to
a
cooler
part
of
the
stove
so
that
the
water
will
bubble
only
enough
for
a
very
slight
motion
to
be
observed
throughout
the
cooking
the
meat
should
not
be
allowed
to
boil
violently
nor
to
cease
bubbling
entirely
the
meat
should
be
allowed
to
cook
for
at
least
hours
but
longer
if
possible
if
during
this
long
cooking
too
much
water
evaporates
more
should
be
added
to
dilute
the
stock
the
salt
that
is
required
for
seasoning
may
be
added
just
a
few
minutes
before
the
stock
is
removed
from
the
kettle
however
it
is
better
to
add
the
salt
together
with
the
other
seasonings
after
the
stock
has
been
drawn
off
for
salt
like
heat
has
a
tendency
to
harden
the
tissues
of
meat
and
to
prevent
the
flavor
from
being
readily
extracted
although
as
has
been
explained
flavor
is
drawn
from
the
fibers
of
meat
by
boiling
it
slowly
for
a
long
time
the
cooking
of
meat
for
soup
does
not
extract
the
nourishment
from
it
to
any
extent
in
reality
the
meat
itself
largely
retains
its
original
nutritive
value
after
it
has
been
cooked
for
soup
although
a
small
quantity
of
protein
is
drawn
out
and
much
of
the
fat
is
removed
this
meat
should
never
be
wasted
rather
it
should
be
used
carefully
with
materials
that
will
take
the
place
of
the
flavor
that
has
been
cooked
from
it
flavoring
it
is
the
flavoring
of
stock
that
indicates
real
skill
in
soup
making
so
this
is
an
extremely
important
part
of
the
work
in
fact
the
large
number
of
ingredients
found
in
soup
recipes
are
as
a
rule
the
various
flavorings
which
give
the
distinctive
flavor
and
individuality
to
a
soup
however
the
housewife
whose
larder
will
not
produce
all
of
the
many
things
that
may
be
called
for
in
a
recipe
should
not
feel
that
she
must
forego
making
a
particular
kind
of
soup
very
often
certain
spices
or
certain
flavoring
materials
may
be
omitted
without
any
appreciable
difference
or
something
that
is
on
hand
may
be
substituted
for
an
ingredient
that
is
lacking
the
flavorings
used
most
for
soup
include
cloves
peppercorns
red
black
and
white
pepper
paprika
bay
leaf
sage
marjoram
thyme
summer
savory
tarragon
celery
seed
fennel
mint
and

while
all
of
these
are
not
absolutely
necessary
the
majority
of
them
may
well
be
kept
on
the
pantry
shelf
in
addition
a
bottle
of
worcestershire
sauce
should
be
kept
on
hand
celery
and
parsley
which
are
also
much
used
for
flavoring
can
usually
be
purchased
fresh
but
as
they
are
scarce
at
times
it
is
advisable
to
dry
some
of
the
leaves
during
the
season
when
they
can
be
secured
so
as
to
have
a
supply
when
they
are
not
in
the
market
a
small
amount
of
lemon
peel
often
improves
soup
so
some
of
this
should
be
kept
in
store
another
group
of
vegetables
that
lend
themselves
admirably
to
soup
flavoring
includes
leeks
shallots
chives
garlic
and
onions
all
of
which
belong
to
the
same
family
they
must
be
used
judiciously
however
as
a
strong
flavor
of
any
of
them
is
offensive
to
most
persons
as
many
of
the
flavorings
used
for
soup
lose
their
strength
when
they
are
exposed
to
the
air
every
effort
should
be
made
to
keep
them
in
good
condition
many
of
them
can
be
kept
an
indefinite
length
of
time
if
they
are
placed
in
tightly
closed
metal
boxes
or
glass
jars
flavorings
and
spices
bought
from
the
grocer
or
the
druggist
in
paper
packages
should
be
transferred
to
and
enclosed
in
a
receptacle
that
will
not
allow
them
to
deteriorate
if
proper
attention
is
given
to
these
materials
the
supply
will
not
have
to
be
replenished
often
likewise
the
cost
of
a
sufficient
number
to
produce
the
proper
flavorings
will
be
very
slight
in
the
use
of
any
of
the
flavorings
mentioned
or
the
strongly
flavored
vegetables
care
should
be
taken
not
to
allow
any
one
particular
flavor
to
predominate
each
should
be
used
in
such
quantity
that
it
will
blend
well
with
the
others
a
very
good
way
in
which
to
fix
spices
and
herbs
that
are
to
flavor
soup
is
to
tie
them
in
a
small
piece
of
cheesecloth
and
drop
the
bag
thus
made
into
the
soup
pot
when
prepared
in
this
way
they
will
remain
together
so
that
while
the
flavor
can
be
cooked
out
they
can
be
more
readily
removed
from
the
liquid
than
if
they
are
allowed
to
spread
through
the
contents
of
the
pot
salt
which
is
of
course
always
used
to
season
soup
should
be
added
in
the
proportion
of
teaspoonful
to
each
quart
of
liquid
removing
grease
from
a
greasy
soup
is
always
unpalatable
therefore
a
very
important
feature
of
soup
making
whether
a
thin
or
a
thick
soup
is
being
made
is
the
removal
of
all
grease
various
ways
of
removing
grease
have
been
devised
depending
on
whether
the
soup
is
hot
or
cold
in
the
case
of
hot
or
warm
soup
all
the
grease
that
it
is
possible
to
remove
with
a
spoon
may
be
skimmed
from
the
top
and
the
remainder
then
taken
up
with
a
piece
of
clean
blotting
paper
or
absorbent
cotton
another
plan
by
which
the
fat
may
be
hardened
and
then
collected
consists
in
tying
a
few
small
pieces
of
ice
in
a
piece
of
cloth
and
drawing
them
over
the
surface
of
the
soup
a
very
simple
method
is
to
allow
the
soup
or
stock
to
become
cold
and
then
remove
the
fat
which
collects
on
the
top
and
hardens
by
merely
lifting
off
the
cake
that
forms
clearing
sometimes
it
is
desired
to
improve
the
appearance
of
soup
stock
particularly
a
small
amount
of
soup
that
is
to
be
served
at
a
very
dainty
luncheon
or
dinner
in
order
to
do
this
the
stock
may
be
treated
by
a
certain
process
that
will
cause
it
to
become
clear
after
being
cleared
it
may
be
served
as
a
thin
soup
or
if
it
is
heavy
enough
it
may
be
made
into
a
clear
sparkling
jelly
into
which
many
desirable
things
may
be
molded
for
salad
or
for
a
dish
to
accompany
a
heavy
course
clearing
soup
is
rather
extravagant
however
while
it
does
not
improve
the
taste
it
does
improve
the
appearance
a
very
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
clear
stock
is
to
use
egg
whites
and
crushed
egg
shell
to
each
quart
of
cold
stock
should
be
added
the
crushed
shell
and
a
slightly
beaten
egg
white
these
should
be
mixed
well
placed
on
the
fire
and
the
mixture
stirred
constantly
until
it
boils
as
the
egg
coagulates
some
of
the
floating
particles
in
the
stock
are
caught
and
carried
to
the
top
while
others
are
carried
to
the
bottom
by
the
particles
of
shell
as
they
settle
after
the
mixture
has
boiled
for
or
minutes
the
top
should
be
skimmed
carefully
and
the
stock
then
strained
through
a
fine
cloth
when
it
has
been
reheated
the
cleared
stock
will
be
ready
to
serve
thickening
although
thin
clear
soups
are
preferred
by
some
and
are
particularly
desirable
for
their
stimulating
effect
thick
soups
find
much
favor
when
they
are
used
to
form
a
substantial
part
of
a
meal
besides
giving
consistency
to
soup
thickening
usually
improves
the
flavor
but
its
chief
purpose
is
to
give
nutritive
value
to
this
food
in
fact
whenever
a
soup
is
thickened
its
food
value
is
increased
by
the
ingredient
thus
added
for
this
reason
it
is
advisable
to
thicken
soups
when
they
are
desired
for
any
other
purpose
than
their
stimulating
effect
the
substance
used
to
thicken
soups
may
be
either
a
starchy
material
or
food
or
a
purée
of
some
food
the
starchy
materials
generally
used
for
this
purpose
are
plain
flour
browned
flour
corn
starch
and
arrowroot
flour
any
one
of
these
should
be
moistened
with
enough
cold
water
to
make
a
mixture
that
will
pour
easily
and
then
added
to
the
hot
liquid
while
the
soup
is
stirred
constantly
to
prevent
the
formation
of
lumps
a
sufficient
amount
of
this
thickening
material
should
be
used
to
make
a
soup
of
the
consistency
of
heavy
cream
the
starchy
foods
that
are
used
for
thickening
include
rice
barley
oatmeal
noodles
tapioca
sago
and
macaroni
many
unusual
and
fancy
forms
of
macaroni
can
be
secured
or
the
plain
varieties
of
italian
pastes
may
be
broken
into
small
pieces
and
cooked
with
the
soup
when
any
of
these
foods
are
used
they
should
be
added
long
enough
before
the
soup
is
removed
to
be
cooked
thoroughly
purées
of
beans
peas
lentils
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
are
especially
desirable
for
the
thickening
of
soups
for
they
not
only
give
consistency
but
add
nutritive
value
and
flavor
as
well
another
excellent
thickening
may
be
obtained
by
beating
raw
eggs
and
then
adding
them
carefully
to
the
soup
just
before
it
is
to
be
served
after
eggs
have
been
added
for
thickening
the
soup
should
not
be
allowed
to
boil
as
it
is
liable
to
curdle
keeping
soup
stock
like
many
other
foods
spoils
quite
readily
therefore
in
order
to
keep
it
for
at
least
a
few
days
it
must
receive
proper
attention
at
all
times
the
vessel
containing
stock
should
be
tightly
closed
and
especially
in
warm
weather
the
stock
should
be
kept
as
cold
as
possible
stock
that
is
heavy
enough
to
solidify
into
a
jellylike
consistency
when
it
is
cold
will
keep
better
than
stock
that
remains
liquid
the
addition
of
salt
or
any
spicy
flavoring
also
helps
to
keep
stock
from
deteriorating
because
these
materials
act
as
preservatives
and
prevent
the
action
of
bacteria
that
cause
spoiling
bacteria
may
be
kept
from
entering
soup
if
instead
of
removing
the
grease
it
is
allowed
to
form
in
a
solid
cake
over
the
top
no
matter
which
of
these
precautions
is
taken
to
prevent
stock
from
spoiling
it
should
be
heated
to
boiling
point
once
a
day
when
it
is
to
be
kept
for
several
days
serving
soup
soup
may
be
correctly
served
in
several
different
ways
the
method
to
adopt
usually
depending
on
the
kind
of
soup
thin
clear
soups
are
generally
served
in
bouillon
cups
as
shown
in

which
may
be
placed
on
the
table
immediately
before
the
family
assembles

heavier
soups
may
be
served
at

preferable
illustration
fig
the
spoon
to
be
served
with
soup
also
depends
on
the
kind
of
soup
but
a
larger
spoon
than
a
teaspoon
is
always
necessary
when
soup
is
served

a
bouillon

is
the
best
kind
to
use
with
any
thin
soup
served
in
bouillon
cups
such
a
spoon
as
shown
in
fig
is
about
the
length
of
a
teaspoon
but
has
a
round
bowl
to
increase
the
attractiveness
of
soup
and
at
the
same
time
make
it
more
appetizing
and
nutritious
various
accompaniments
and
relishes
are
served
with
it
when
the
accompaniment
is
in
the
form
of
crackers
croutons
or
bread
sticks
they
may
be
passed
after
the
soup
is
served
or
as
shown
in
figs
and
a
few
of
them
may
be
placed
on
the
plate
at
each
person
place
the
relishes
should
be
passed
while
the
soup
is
being
eaten
plain
whipped
cream
or
whipped
cream

which
a
little
mashed
pimiento

been
stirred
adds
much
to
the
flavor
and
appearance
of
soup
when
served
on
the
top
of
any
hot
or
cold
variety
then
too
many
soups
especially
vegetable
soups
are
improved
in
flavor
by
the
addition
of
a
spoonful
of
grated
cheese
which
should
be
sprinkled
into
the
dish
at
the
time
of
serving
for
this
purpose
a
hard
dry
cheese
such
as
parmesan
which
can
often
be
purchased
already
grated
in
bottles
is
the
most
satisfactory
illustration
fig
in
summer
clear
soups
are
sometimes
served
cold
as
cold
soups
are
found
more
desirable
for
warm
weather
than

ones
however
when
a

it
should
be
hot
when

may
put
into

the
knowledge
she
has
gained
about
soup
making
there
are
here
given
recipes
for
various
kinds
of
soup
as
will
be

these
recipes
are

according
to
the
consistency
and
nature
of
the
soups
all
those
of
one
class
being
placed
in
the

group
as
it
is
important
too
for
the
housewife
to
know
how
to
prepare
the
various
accompaniments
and
garnishes
that
are
generally
served
with
soup
directions
for
the
making
of
these
are
also
given
and
they
follow
the
soup
recipes
in
carrying
out
these
recipes
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
exactness
in
fulfilling
the
requirements
and
care
in
working
out
the
details
of
the
recipes
are
essential
these
points
can
not
be
ignored
in
the
making
of
soup
any
more
than
in
other
parts
of
cookery
provided
successful
results
and
excellent
appearance
are
desired
it
is
therefore
wise
to
form
habits
of
exactness
for
instance
when
vegetables
are
to
be
cut
for
soups
they
should
be
cut
into
pieces
of
equal
size
or
if
they
are
to
be
diced
they
should
be
cut
so
that
the
dice
are
alike
all
the
pieces
must
be
of
the
same
thickness
in
order
to
insure
uniform
cooking
if
this
precaution
is
not
observed
some
of
the
pieces
are
likely
to
overcook
and
fall
to
pieces
before
the
others
are
done
strict
attention
should
also
be
given
to
the
preparation
of
other
ingredients
and
the
accompaniments
the
meat
used
must
be
cut
very
carefully
rather
than
in
ragged
uneven
pieces
noodles
which
are
often
used
in
soup
may
be
of
various
widths
but
all
those
used
at
one
time
should
be
uniform
in
width
that
is
all
wide
or
all
narrow
if
different
widths
are
used
an
impression
of
careless
cutting
will
be
given
croutons
and
bread
sticks
to
be
most
satisfactory
should
be
cut
straight
and
even
and
in

illustration
fig
the
soup
course
of
a
meal
is
a
more
or
less
unattractive
one
but
it
may
be
improved
considerably
if
some
tempting
thing
in
the
way
of
a
garnish
or
an
accompaniment
is
served
with
it
but
whatever
is
selected
to
accompany
soup
should
be
in
a
great
measure
a
contrast
to
it
in
both
consistency
and
color
the
reason
why
a
difference
in
consistency
is
necessary
is
due
to
the
nature
of
soup
which
being
liquid
in
form
is
merely
swallowed
and
does
not
stimulate
the
flow
of
the
gastric
juices
by
mastication
therefore
the
accompaniment
should
be
something
that
requires
chewing
and
that
will
consequently
cause
the
digestive
juices
which
respond
to
the
mechanical
action
of
chewing
to
flow
the
garnish
may
add
the
color
that
is
needed
to
make
soup
attractive
the
green
and
red
of
olives
and
radishes
or
of
celery
and
radishes
make
a
decided
contrast
so
that
when
any
of
these
things
are
served
with
soup
an
appetizing
first
course
is
the
result
it
is
not
necessary
to
serve
more
than
one
of
them
but
if
celery
and
radishes
or
celery
radishes
and
olives
can
be
combined
in
the
same
relish
dish
they
become
more
attractive
than
when
each
is
served
by
itself
illustration
fig
radishes
and
before
radishes
and
celery
are
used
on
the
table
whether
with
soup
or
some
other
part
of
a
meal
they
should
be
put
into
cold
water
and
allowed
to
stand
for
some
time
so
that
they
will
be
perfectly
crisp
when
they
are
served
in
the
case
of
radishes
the
tops
and
roots
should
first
be
cut
from
them
and
the
radishes
then
scrubbed
thoroughly
they
may
be
served
without
any
further
treatment
or
they
may
be
prepared
to
resemble
flowers
as
is
shown
in
fig
this
may
be
done
by
peeling
the
red
skin
back
to
show
the
white
inside
and
then
cutting
the
sections
to
look
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
preparing
radishes
in
this
artistic
way
if
a
sharp
knife
is
used
for
with
a
little
practice
the
work
can
be
done
quickly
and
skilfully
celery
that
is
to
be
served
with
soup
may
be
prepared
in
two
ways
as
fig
illustrates
the
stems
may
be
pulled
from
the
stalk
and
served
separately
as
in
the
group
on
the
right
or
the
stalk
may
be
cut
down
through
the
center
with
a
knife
into
four
or
more
pieces
as
shown
at
the
left
of
the
illustration
the
first
of
these
methods
is
not
so
good
as
the
second
for
by
it
one
person
gets
all
of
the
tender
heart
and
the
coarse
outside
stems
are
left
for
all
the
others
by
the
second
method
every
piece
consists
of
some
of
the
heart
and
some
of
the
outside
stems
attached
to
the
root
and
makes
a
similar
serving
for
each
person
whichever
way
is
adopted
however
the
celery
should
be
scrubbed
and
cleansed
thoroughly
this
is
often
a
difficult
task
because
the
dirt
sticks
tightly
between
the
stems
still
an
effort
should
be
made
to
have
the
celery
entirely
free
from
dirt
before
it
goes
to
the
table
a
few
tender
yellow
leaves
may
be
left
on
the
pieces
to
improve
the
appearance
of
the
celery
various
kinds
of
wafers
and
crackers
can
be
purchased
to
serve
with
soup
and
the
selection
as
well
as
the
serving
of
them
is
entirely
a
matter
of
individual
taste
one
point
however
that
must
not
be
overlooked
is
that
crackers
of
any
kind
must
be
crisp
in
order
to
be
appetizing
dry
foods
of
this
sort
absorb
moisture
from
the
air
when
they
are
exposed
to
it
and
consequently
become
tough
as
heat
drives
off
this
moisture
and
restores
the
original
crispness
crackers
should
always
be
heated
before
they
are
served
their
flavor
can
be
improved
by
toasting
them
until
they
are
light
brown
in
color
as
has
already
been
learned
croutons
are
small
pieces
of
bread
that
have
been
fried
or
toasted
to
serve
with
soup
these
are
usually
made
in
the
form
of
cubes
or
dice
as
is
shown
in
the
front
group
in
fig
but
they
may
be
cut
into
triangles
circles
ovals
hearts
or
in
fact
any
fancy
shape
by
means
of
small
cutters
that
can
be
purchased
for
such
purposes
the
bread
used
for
croutons
should
not
be
fresh
bread
as
such
bread
does
not
toast
nor
fry
very
well
toast
stale
bread
or
slices
of
bread
that
have
been
cut
from
the
loaf
and
not
eaten
are
usually
found
more
satisfactory
if
the
croutons
are
not
made
from
slices
already
cut
the
bread
should
be
cut
into
slices
to
inch
thick
and
after
the
crusts
have
been
closely
trimmed
the
slices
should
be
cut
into
cubes
when
the
cubes
have
been
obtained
they
may
be
put
into
a
shallow
pan
and
toasted
on
all
sides
quickly
placed
in
a
frying
basket
and
browned
in
deep
fat
or
put
into
a
frying
pan
and
sautéd
in
butter
if
toast
is
used
it
should
merely
be
cut
in
the
desired
shape
various
methods
of
serving
croutons
are
in
practice
some
housewives
prefer
to
place
them
in
the
soup
tureen
and
pour
the
soup
over
them
while
others
like
to
put
a
few
in
each
individual
serving
of
soup
a
better
plan
however
and
one
that
is
much
followed
is
to
serve
a
number
of
croutons
on
a
small
plate
or
dish
at
each
person
place
as
shown
in
figs
and
for
then

one
may
eat
them

term
is
generally
used
it
refers
particularly
to
the
flesh
of
the
domestic
animals
and
does
not
include
poultry
game
fish
and
the
like
it
is
in
this
limited
sense
that
meat
is
considered
in
these
sections
and
the
kinds
to
which
attention
is
given
are
beef
veal
lamb
mutton
and
pork
meat
including
these
varieties
forms
one
of
the
principal
sources
of
the
family
food
supply
as
such
it
is
valuable
chiefly
as
a
food
but
in
the
form
of
broths
and
extracts
made
from
it
meat
stimulates
the
appetite
and
actually
assists
the
flow
of
gastric
juice
therefore
so
that
the
outlay
for
meat
will
not
be
greater
than
it
should
be
and
this
food
will
provide
the
greatest
amount
of
nourishment
every
housewife
should
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
place
it
occupies
in
the
dietary
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
food
eaten
by
human
beings
comes
from
two
sources
animal
and
vegetable
the
foods
of
animal
origin
which
include
milk
eggs
and
meat
have
a
certain
similarity
that
causes
them
to
be
classed
together
and
this
is
the
fact
that
they
are
foods
milk
is
the
first
protein
food
fed
to
the
young
but
a
little
later
it
is
partly
replaced
by
eggs
and
finally
or
in
adult
life
meat
largely
takes
the
place
of
both
for
this
reason
meat
has
considerable
importance
in
the
dietary
in
reality
from
this
food
is
obtained
the
greatest
amount
of
protein
that
the
average
person
eats
however
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
milk
and
eggs
as
well
as
cheese
and
even
cereals
and
vegetables
can
be
made
to
take
the
place
of
meat
when
the
use
of
less
of
this
food
is
deemed
advisable
as
the
work
of
protein
foods
is
to
build
and
repair
tissue
it
is
on
them
that
the
human
race
largely
depends
of
course
protein
also
yields
energy
but
the
amount
is
so
small
that
if
one
variety
of
protein
food
such
as
meat
were
eaten
simply
to
supply
energy
to
the
body
huge
quantities
of
it
would
be
needed
to
do
the
same
work
that
a
small
amount
of
less
expensive
food
would
accomplish
some
persons
have
an
idea
that
meat
produces
the
necessary
strength
and
energy
of
those
who
perform
hard
work
this
is
entirely
erroneous
because
fats
and
carbohydrates
are
the
food
substances
that
produce
the
energy
required
to
do
work
some
kind
of
protein
is
of
course
absolutely
necessary
to
the
health
of
every
normal
person
but
a
fact
that
can
not
be
emphasized
too
strongly
is
that
an
oversupply
of
it
does
more
harm
than
good
scientists
have
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
determine
just
how
much
of
these
foods
is
necessary
for
individuals
but
they
have
found
this
a
difficult
matter
nevertheless
it
is
generally
conceded
that
most
persons
are
likely
to
use
too
much
rather
than
too
little
of
them
it
is
essential
then
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
economy
but
from
the
far
more
important
principle
of
health
that
the
modern
housewife
should
know
the
nutritive
value
of
meats
in
her
efforts
to
familiarize
herself
with
these
matters
the
housewife
should
ever
remember
that
meat
is
the
most
expensive
of
the
daily
foods
of
a
family
hence
to
get
the
greatest
value
for
the
money
expended
meat
must
be
bought
judiciously
cared
for
properly
and
prepared
carefully
too
many
housewives
trust
the
not
butcher
to
give
them
the
kind
of
meat
they
should
have
and
very
often
they
do
not
have
a
clear
idea
as
to
whether
it
is
the
best
piece
that
can
be
purchased
for
the
desired
purpose
and
for
the
price
that
is
asked
every
housewife
ought
to
be
so
familiar
with
the
various
cuts
of
meat
that
she
need
not
depend
on
any
one
except
herself
in
the
purchase
of
this
food
she
will
find
that
both
the
buying
and
the
preparation
of
meats
will
be
a
simple
matter
for
her
if
she
learns
these
three
important
things
from
what
part
of
the
animal
the
particular
piece
she
desires
is
cut
and
how
to
ask
for
that
piece
how
to
judge
a
good
piece
of
meat
by
its
appearance
and
what
to
do
with
it
from
the
moment
it
is
purchased
until
the
last
bit
of
it
is
used
of
these
three
things
the
cooking
of
meat
is
the
one
that
demands
the
most
attention
because
it
has
a
decided
effect
on
the
quality
and
digestibility
of
this
food
proper
cooking
is
just
as
essential
in
the
case
of
meat
as
for
any
other
food
for
a
tender
digestible
piece
of
meat
may
be
made
tough
and
indigestible
by
improper
preparation
while
a
tough
piece
may
be
made
tender
and
very
appetizing
by
careful
intelligent
preparation
the
cheaper
cuts
of
meat
which
are
often
scorned
as
being
too
tough
for
use
may
be
converted
into
delicious
dishes
by
the
skilful
cook
who
understands
how
to
apply
the
various
methods
of
cookery
and
knows
what
their
effect
will
be
on
the
meat
tissues
unfortunately
thorough
cooking
affects
the
digestibility
of
meat
unfavorably
but
it
is
doubtless
a
wise
procedure
in
some
cases
because
as
is
definitely
known
some
of
the
parasites
that
attack
man
find
their
way
into
the
system
through
the
meat
that
is
eaten
these
are
carried
to
meat
from
external
sources
such
as
dust
flies
and
the
soiled
hands
of
persons
handling
it
and
they
multiply
and
thrive
it
is
known
too
that
some
of
the
germs
that
cause
disease
in
the
animal
remain
in
its
flesh
and
are
thus
transmitted
to
human
beings
that
eat
such
meat
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
its
good
condition
meat
must
be
thoroughly
cooked
because
long
cooking
completely
eliminates
the
danger
from
such
sources
structure
and
composition
of
meat
an
understanding
of
the
physical
structure
of
meat
is
essential
to
its
successful
cooking
meat
consists
of
muscular
tissue
or
lean
varying
quantities
of
visible
fat
that
lie
between
and
within
the
membranes
and
tendons
and
also
particles
of
fat
that
are
too
small
to
be
distinguished
except
with
the
aid
of
a
microscope
the
general
nature
of
the
lean
part
of
meat
can
be
determined
by
examining
a
piece
of
it
with
merely
the
unaided
eye
on
close
observation
it
will
be
noted
that
especially
in
the
case
of
meat
that
has
been
cooked
innumerable
fibers
make
up
the
structure
with
a
microscope
it
can
be
observed
that
these
visible
fibers
are
made
up
of
still
smaller
ones
the
length
of
which
varies
in
different
parts
of
the
animal
it
is
to
the
length
of
these
fibers
that
the
tenderness
of
meat
is
due
short
fibers
are
much
easier
to
chew
than
long
ones
consequently
the
pieces
containing
them
are
the
most
tender
these
muscle
fibers
which
are
in
the
form
of
tiny
tubes
are
filled
with
a
protein
substance
they
are
held
together
with
a
tough
stringy
material
called
as
the
animal
grows
older
and
its
muscles
are
used
more
the
walls
of
these
tubes
or
fibers
become
dense
and
tough
likewise
the
amount
of
connective
tissue
increases
and
becomes
tougher
among
the
muscle
fibers
are
embedded
layers
and
particles
of
fat
the
quantity
of
which
varies
greatly
in
different
animals
and
depends
largely
on
the
age
of
the
animal
for
instance
lamb
and
veal
usually
have
very
little
fat
in
the
tissues
mutton
and
beef
always
contain
more
while
pork
contains
a
greater
amount
of
fat
than
the
meat
of
any
other
domestic
animal
the
composition
of
meat
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
the
breed
of
the
animal
the
degree
to
which
it
has
been
fattened
and
the
particular
cut
of
meat
in
question
however
the
muscle
fibers
are
made
up
of
protein
and
contain
more
protein
mineral
salts
or
ash
and
certain
substances
called
all
of
which
are
held
in
solution
by
water
the
younger
the
animal
the
greater
is
the
proportion
of
water
and
the
lower
the
nutritive
value
of
meat
it
should
be
understood
however
that
not
all
of
meat
is
edible
material
indeed
a
large
part
of
it
is
made
up
of
gristle
bones
cartilage
nerves
blood
vessels
and
connective
tissue
the
amount
of
these
indigestible
materials
also
varies
in
different
animals
and
different
cuts
but
the
average
proportion
in
a
piece
of
meat
is
usually
considered
to
be
per
cent
of
the
whole
because
of
the
variation
of
both
the
edible
and
inedible
material
of
meat
a
standard
composition
for
this
food
can
not
readily
be
given
however
an
idea
of
the
average
composition
of
the
various
kinds
can
be
obtained

protein
in
the
value
of
meat
as
food
is
due
to
the
proteins
that
it
contains
numerous
kinds
of
protein
occur
in
meat
but
the
chief
varieties
are
myosin
and
muscle
albumin
the
which
is
the
most
important
protein
and
occurs
in
the
greatest
quantity
hardens
after
the
animal
has
been
killed
and
the
muscles
have
become
cold
the
tissues
then
become
tough
and
hard
a
condition
known
as
as
meat
in
this
condition
is
not
desirable
it
should
be
used
before
rigor
mortis
sets
in
or
else
it
should
be
put
aside
until
this
condition
of
toughness
disappears
the
length
of
time
necessary
for
this
to
occur
varies
with
the
size
of
the
animal
that
is
killed
it
may
be
from
hours
to
or
days
the
disappearance
is
due
to
the
development
of
certain
acids
that
cause
the
softening
of
the
tissues
the
which
is
contained
in
solution
in
the
muscle
fibers
is
similar
in
composition
to
the
albumen
of
eggs
and
milk
and
it
is
affected
by
the
application
of
heat
in
the
cooking
processes
in
much
the
same
way
gelatine
in
the
gelatine
that
is
found
in
meat
is
a
substance
very
similar
in
composition
to
protein
but
it
has
less
value
as
food
it
is
contained
in
the
connective
tissue
and
can
be
extracted
by
boiling
being
apparent
as
a
jellylike
substance
after
the
water
in
which
meat
has
been
cooked
has
cooled
use
is
made
of
this
material
in
the
preparation
of
pressed
meats
and
fowl
and
in
various
salads
and
other
dishes
some
kinds
of
commercial
gelatine
are
also
made
from
it
being
first
extracted
from
the
meat
and
then
evaporated
to
form
a
dry
substance
fat
in
all
meat
no
matter
how
lean
it
appears
contains
some
fat
as
already
explained
a
part
of
the
fat
contained
in
meat
occurs
in
small
particles
so
embedded
in
the
muscle
fibers
as
not
to
be
readily
seen
while
the
other
part
occurs
in
sufficient
amounts
to
be
visible
in
the
flesh
of
some
animals
such
as
veal
and
rabbit
there
is
almost
no
visible
fat
but
in
very
fat
hogs
or
fowls
or
of
the
weight
may
be
fat
meats
that
are
very
fat
are
higher
in
nutritive
value
than
meats
that
contain
only
a
small
amount
of
this
substance
as
will
be
observed
on
referring
to
the
table
of
meat
compositions
in
fig
however
an
excessive
amount
of
fat
prevents
the
protein
materials
from
digesting
normally
the
quality
of
fat
varies
greatly
there
being
two
distinct
kinds
of
this
material
in
animals
that
which
covers
or
lies
between
the
muscles
or
occurs
on
the
outside
of
the
body
just
beneath
the
skin
has
a
lower
melting
point
is
less
firm
and
is
of
a
poorer
grade
for
most
purposes
than
that
which
is
found
inside
the
bony
structure
and
surrounds
the
internal
organs
the
suet
of
beef
is
an
example
of
this
internal
fat
fat
is
a
valuable
constituent
of
food
for
it
is
the
most
concentrated
form
in
which
the
fuel
elements
of
food
are
found
in
supplying
the
body
with
fuel
it
serves
to
maintain
the
body
temperature
and
to
yield
energy
in
the
form
of
muscular
and
other
power
since
this
is
such
a
valuable
food
material
it
is
important
that
the
best
possible
use
be
made
of
all
drippings
and
fats
and
that
not
even
the
smallest
amount
of
any
kind
be
wasted
carbohydrate
in
in
the
liver
and
all
muscle
fibers
of
animals
is
stored
a
small
supply
of
carbohydrate
in
a
form
that
is
called
or
however
there
is
not
enough
of
this
substance
to
be
of
any
appreciable
value
and
so
far
as
the
methods
of
cookery
and
the
uses
of
meat
as
food
are
concerned
it
is
of
no
importance
water
in
the
proportion
of
water
in
meat
varies
from
to
of
the
whole
depending
on
the
amount
of
fat
the
meat
contains
and
the
age
of
the
animal
this
water
carries
with
it
the
flavor
much
of
the
mineral
matter
and
some
food
material
so
that
when
the
water
is
removed
from
the
tissues
these
things
are
to
a
great
extent
lost
the
methods
of
cookery
applied
to
meat
are
based
on
the
principle
of
either
retaining
or
extracting
the
water
that
it
contains
the
meat
in
which
water
is
retained
is
more
easily
chewed
and
swallowed
than
that
which
is
dry
however
the
water
contained
in
flesh
has
no
greater
value
as
food
than
other
water
therefore
as
will
be
seen
in
fig
the
greater
the
amount
of
water
in
a
given
weight
of
food
the
less
is
its
nutritive
value
minerals
in
eight
or
more
kinds
of
minerals
in
sufficient
quantities
to
be
of
importance
in
the
diet
are
to
be
found
in
meat
lean
meat
contains
the
most
minerals
they
decrease
in
proportion
as
the
amount
of
fat
increases
these
salts
assist
in
the
building
of
hard
tissues
and
have
a
decided
effect
on
the
blood
they
are
lost
from
the
tissues
of
meat
by
certain
methods
of
cookery
but
as
they
are
in
solution
in
the
water
in
which
the
meat
is
cooked
they
need
not
be
lost
to
the
diet
if
use
is
made
of
this
water
for
soups
sauces
and
gravies
extractives
in
the
appetizing
flavor
of
meat
is
due
to
substances
called
the
typical
flavor
that
serves
to
distinguish
pork
from
beef
or
mutton
is
due
to
the
difference
in
the
extractives
although
necessary
for
flavoring
these
have
no
nutritive
value
in
fact
the
body
throws
them
off
as
waste
material
when
they
are
taken
with
the
food
in
some
methods
of
cookery
such
as
broiling
and
roasting
the
extractives
are
retained
while
in
others
such
as
those
employed
for
making
stews
and
soups
they
are
drawn
out
extractives
occur
in
the
greatest
quantity
in
the
muscles
that
the
animal
exercises
a
great
deal
and
that
in
reality
have
become
tough
likewise
a
certain
part
of
an
old
animal
contains
more
extractives
than
the
same
part
of
a
young
one
for
these
reasons
a
very
young
chicken
is
broiled
while
an
old
one
is
used
for
stew
and
ribs
of
beef
are
roasted
while
the
shins
are
used
for
soup
meat
that
is
allowed
to
hang
and
ripen
develops
compounds
that
are
similar
to
extractives
and
that
impart
additional
flavor
a
ripened
steak
is
usually
preferred
to
one
cut
from
an
animal
that
has
been
killed
only
a
short
time
however
as
the
ripening
is
in
reality
a
decomposition
process
the
meat
is
said
to
become
high
if
it
is
allowed
to
hang
too
long
purchase
and
care
of
meat
purchase
of
of
all
the
money
that
is
spent
for
food
in
the
united
states
nearly
is
spent
for
meat
this
proportion
is
greater
than
that
of
any
european
country
and
is
probably
more
than
is
necessary
to
provide
diets
that
are
properly
balanced
if
it
is
found
that
the
meat
bill
is
running
too
high
one
or
more
of
several
things
may
be
the
cause
the
one
who
does
the
purchasing
may
not
understand
the
buying
of
meat
the
cheaper
cuts
may
not
be
used
because
of
a
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
how
they
should
be
prepared
to
make
them
appetizing
or
more
meat
may
be
served
than
is
necessary
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
family
much
of
this
difficulty
can
be
overcome
if
the
person
purchasing
meat
goes
to
the
market
personally
to
see
the
meat
cut
and
weighed
instead
of
telephoning
the
order
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
method
of
cutting
an
animal
varies
in
different
parts
of
the
country
as
does
also
the
naming
of
the
different
pieces
however
this
need
give
the
housewife
no
concern
for
the
dealer
from
whom
the
meat
is
purchased
is
usually
willing
to
supply
any
information
that
is
desired
about
the
cutting
of
meat
and
the
best
use
for
certain
pieces
in
fact
if
the
butcher
is
competent
this
is
a
very
good
source
from
which
to
obtain
a
knowledge
of
such
matters
another
way
in
which
to
reduce
the
meat
bill
is
to
utilize
the
trimmings
of
bone
and
fat
from
pieces
of
meat
in
most
cases
these
are
of
no
value
to
the
butcher
so
that
if
a
request
for
them
is
made
he
will
as
a
rule
be
glad
to
wrap
them
up
with
the
meat
that
is
purchased
they
are
of
considerable
value
to
the
housewife
for
the
bones
may
go
into
the
stock
pot
while
the
fat
if
it
is
tried
out
can
be
used
for
many
things
the
quantity
of
meat
to
purchase
depends
of
course
on
the
number
of
persons
that
are
to
be
served
with
it
however
it
is
often
a
good
plan
to
purchase
a
larger
piece
than
is
required
for
a
single
meal
and
then
use
what
remains
for
another
meal
for
instance
a
large
roast
is
always
better
than
a
small
one
because
it
does
not
dry
out
in
the
process
of
cookery
and
the
part
that
remains
after
one
meal
may
be
served
cold
in
slices
or
used
for
making
some
other
dish
such
as
meat
pie
or
hash
such
a
plan
also
saves
both
time
and
fuel
because
sufficient
meat
for
several
meals
may
be
cooked
at
one
time
in
purchasing
meat
there
are
certain
pieces
that
should
never
be
asked
for
by
the
pound
or
by
the
price
for
instance
the
housewife
should
not
say
to
the
butcher
give
me
pounds
of
porterhouse
steak
nor
should
she
say
give
me
cents
worth
of
chops
steak
should
be
bought
by
the
cut
and
the
thickness
that
is
desired
should
be
designated
for
example
the
housewife
may
ask
for
an
sirloin
steak
a
porterhouse
steak
and
so
on
chops
should
be
bought
according
to
the
number
of
persons
that
are
to
be
served
usually
a
chop
to
a
person
being
quite
sufficient
rib
roasts
should
be
bought
by
designating
the
number
of
ribs
thus
the
housewife
may
ask
for
a
rib
roast
containing
two
three
four
or
more
ribs
depending
on
the
size
desired
roasts
from
other
parts
of
beef
such
as
chuck
or
rump
roasts
may
be
cut
into
chunks
of
almost
any
desirable
size
without
working
a
disadvantage
to
either
the
butcher
or
the
customer
and
may
therefore
be
bought
by
the
pound
round
bought
for
steaks
should
be
purchased
by
the
cut
as
are
other
steaks
or
if
an
entire
cut
is
too
large
it
may
be
purchased
as
upper
round
or
lower
round
but
the
price
paid
should
vary
with
the
piece
that
is
purchased
round
bought
for
roasts
however
may
be
purchased
by
the
pound
care
of
meat
in
the
animal
foods
decompose
more
readily
than
any
other
kind
and
the
products
of
their
decomposition
are
extremely
dangerous
to
the
health
it
is
therefore
a
serious
matter
when
everything
that
comes
in
contact
with
meat
is
not
clean
regarding
the
proper
care
of
meat
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
market
is
the
first
consideration
the
light
and
ventilation
of
the
room
and
the
cleanliness
of
the
walls
floors
tables
counters
and
other
equipment
are
points
of
the
greatest
importance
and
should
be
noted
by
the
housewife
when
she
is
purchasing
meat
whether
the
windows
and
doors
are
screened
and
all
the
meat
is
carefully
covered
during
the
fly
season
are
also
matters
that
should
not
be
overlooked
then
too
the
cleanliness
and
physical
condition
of
the
persons
who
handle
the
meat
should
be
of
as
great
concern
as
the
sanitary
condition
of
the
market
the
housewife
who
desires
to
supply
her
family
with
the
safest
and
cleanest
meat
should
endeavor
to
purchase
it
in
markets
where
all
the
points
pertaining
to
the
sanitary
condition
are
as
ideal
as
possible
if
she
is
at
all
doubtful
as
to
the
freshness
and
cleanliness
of
what
is
sold
to
her
she
should
give
it
thorough
cooking
in
the
process
of
preparation
so
that
no
harm
will
be
done
to
the
persons
who
are
to
eat
it
care
of
meat
in
the
because
of
the
perishable
nature
of
meat
the
care
given
it
in
the
market
must
be
continued
in
the
home
in
order
that
no
deterioration
may
take
place
before
it
is
cooked
this
is
not
much
of
a
problem
during
cold
weather
but
through
the
summer
months
a
cool
place
in
which
to
keep
it
must
be
provided
unless
the
meat
can
be
cooked
very
soon
after
it
is
delivered
meat
that
must
be
shipped
long
distances
is
frozen
before
it
is
shipped
and
is
kept
frozen
until
just
before
it
is
used
if
such
meat
is
still
frozen
when
it
enters
the
home
it
should
not
be
put
into
a
warm
place
for
then
it
will
thaw
too
quickly
instead
it
should
be
put
in
the
refrigerator
or
in
some
place
where
the
temperature
is
a
few
degrees
above
freezing
point
so
that
it
will
thaw
slowly
and
still
remain
too
cold
for
bacteria
to
become
active
even
if
meat
is
not
frozen
it
must
receive
proper
attention
after
it
enters
the
home
as
soon
as
it
is
received
it
should
be
removed
from
the
wrapping
paper
or
the
wooden
or
cardboard
dish
in
which
it
is
delivered
if
the
meat
has
not
been
purchased
personally
it
is
advisable
to
weigh
it
in
order
to
verify
the
butcher
bill
when
the
housewife
is
satisfied
about
the
weight
she
should
place
the
meat
in
an
earthenware
china
or
enameled
bowl
cover
it
and
then
put
it
away
in
the
coolest
available
place
until
it
is
used
some
persons
put
salt
on
meat
when
they
desire
to
keep
it
but
this
practice
should
be
avoided
as
salt
draws
out
the
juices
from
raw
meat
and
hardens
the
tissues
to
a
certain
extent
if
such
precautions
are
taken
with
meat
it
will
be
in
good
condition
when
it
is
to
be
cooked
however
before
any
cooking
method
is
applied
to
it
it
should
always
be
wiped
with
a
clean
damp
cloth
in
addition
all
fat
should
be
removed
except
just
enough
to
assist
in
cooking
the
meat
and
give
it
a
good
flavor
bone
or
tough
portions
may
also
be
removed
if
they
can
be
used
to
better
advantage
for
soups
or
stews
cooking
of
meat
purposes
of
cooking
meat
it
is
in
the
preparation
of
food
and
of
meat
in
particular
that
one
of
the
marked
differences
between
uncivilized
and
civilized
man
is
evident
raw
meat
which
is
preferred
by
the
savage
does
not
appeal
to
the
appetite
of
most
civilized
persons
in
fact
to
the
majority
of
them
the
idea
of
using
it
for
food
is
disgusting
therefore
civilized
man
prepares
his
meat
before
eating
it
and
the
higher
his
culture
the
more
perfect
are
his
methods
of
preparation
while
it
is
probably
true
that
most
of
the
methods
of
cookery
render
meat
less
easy
to
digest
than
in
its
raw
condition
this
disadvantage
is
offset
by
the
several
purposes
for
which
this
food
is
cooked
meat
is
cooked
chiefly
to
loosen
and
soften
the
connective
tissue
and
thus
cause
the
muscle
tissues
to
be
exposed
more
fully
to
the
action
of
the
digestive
juices
another
important
reason
for
cooking
meat
is
that
subjecting
it
to
the
action
of
heat
helps
to
kill
bacteria
and
parasites
in
addition
meat
is
cooked
to
make
it
more
attractive
to
the
eye
and
to
develop
and
improve
its
flavor
methods
of
cooking
meat
the
result
desired
when
meat
is
cooked
has
much
to
do
with
the
method
of
cookery
to
choose
for
different
methods
produce
different
results
to
understand
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
know
just
what
the
action
of
cooking
is
on
the
material
that
meat
contains
when
raw
meat
is
cut
the
tiny
meat
fibers
are
laid
open
with
the
result
that
in
the
application
of
the
cooking
process
the
albuminous
material
either
is
lost
or
like
the
albumen
of
eggs
is
coagulated
or
hardened
and
thus
retained
therefore
before
preparing
a
piece
of
meat
the
housewife
should
determine
which
of
these
two
things
she
wishes
to
accomplish
and
then
proceed
to
carry
out
the
process
intelligently
the
methods
of
cookery
that
may
be
applied
to
meat
include
broiling
pan
broiling
roasting
stewing
or
simmering
braizing
frying
sautéing
and
fricasseeing
all
of
these
methods
are
explained
in
a
general
way
in
of
part
but
explanations
of
them
as
they
apply
to
meat
are
here
given
in
order
to
acquaint
the
housewife
with
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
various
ways
by
which
this
food
can
be
prepared
broiling
and
pan
only
such
cuts
of
meats
as
require
short
cooking
can
be
prepared
by
the
methods
of
broiling
and
pan
broiling
to
carry
out
these
methods
successfully
severe
heat
must
be
applied
to
the
surface
of
the
meat
so
that
the
albumin
in
the
ends
of
the
muscle
fibers
may
be
coagulated
at
once
this
presents
during
the
remainder
of
the
preparation
a
loss
of
the
meat
juices
meat
to
which
either
of
these
methods
is
applied
will
be
indigestible
on
the
surface
and
many
times
almost
uncooked
in
the
center
as
in
the
case
of
rare
steak
such
meat
however
is
more
digestible
than
thin
pieces
that
are
thoroughly
cooked
at
the
very
high
temperature
required
for
broiling
the
process
of
roasting
either
in
the
oven
or
in
a
pot
on
top
of
the
stove
to
be
properly
done
requires
that
the
piece
of
meat
to
be
roasted
must
first
be
seared
over
the
entire
surface
by
the
application
of
severe
heat
in
the
case
of
a
pot
roast
the
searing
can
be
done
conveniently
in
the
pot
before
the
process
begins
if
the
meat
is
to
be
roasted
in
the
oven
it
may
be
seared
first
in
a
pan
on
top
of
the
stove
however
it
may
be
seared
to
some
extent
by
placing
it
in
a
very
hot
oven
and
turning
it
over
so
that
all
the
surface
is
exposed
then
to
continue
the
roasting
process
the
temperature
must
be
lowered
just
a
little
the
roasting
pan
may
be
of
any
desirable
size
and
shape
that
is
convenient
and
sufficiently
large
to
accommodate
the
meat
to
be
prepared
a
pan
like
that
shown
in
fig
is
both
convenient
and
satisfactory
it
is
provided
with
a
cover
that
fits
tight
in
this
cover
as
shown
is
an
opening
that
may
be
closed
or
opened
so
as
to
regulate
the
amount
of
moisture
inside
the
pan
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
is
a
rack
upon
which
the
meat
may
rest
illustration
fig
to
prepare
meat
for
roasting
flour
should
be
sprinkled
or
rubbed
over
its
lean
surface
before
it
is
put
in
the
pan
this
forms
a
paste
that
cooks
into
a
crust
and
prevents
the
loss
of
juices
from
the
meat
in
roasting
the
heat
is
applied
longer
and
more
slowly
than
in
broiling
or
frying
so
that
there
is
more
possibility
for
the
connective
tissue
beneath
the
surface
to
soften
the
surface
is
however
as
indigestible
as
that
of
broiled
meat
an
important
point
for
every
housewife
to
remember
in
this
connection
is
that
the
larger
the
roast
the
slower
should
be
the
fire
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
long
before
the
heat
could
penetrate
to
the
center
the
outside
would
be
burned
a
small
roast
however
will
be
more
delicious
if
it
is
prepared
with
a
very
hot
fire
for
then
the
juices
will
not
have
a
chance
to
evaporate
and
the
tissues
will
be
more
moist
and
tasty
frying
and
when
meat
is
fried
or
sautéd
that
is
brought
directly
in
contact
with
hot
fat
it
is
made
doubly
indigestible
because
of
the
hardening
of
the
surface
tissues
and
the
indigestibility
of
the
fat
that
penetrates
these
tissues
this
is
especially
true
of
meat
that
is
sautéd
slowly
in
a
small
quantity
of
hot
fat
much
of
this
difficulty
can
be
overcome
however
if
meat
prepared
by
these
methods
like
that
which
is
broiled
or
roasted
is
subjected
quickly
to
intense
heat
in
addition
the
fat
used
for
cooking
should
be
made
hot
before
the
meat
is
put
into
it
to
boil
meat
means
to
cook
it
a
long
time
in
water
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
this
method
of
preparing
meat
is
not
strongly
advocated
for
there
is
seldom
a
time
when
better
results
can
not
be
obtained
by
cooking
meat
at
a
lower
temperature
than
boiling
point
the
best
plan
is
to
bring
the
meat
to
the
boiling
point
allow
it
to
boil
for
a
short
time
and
then
reduce
the
temperature
so
that
the
meat
will
simmer
for
the
remainder
of
the
cooking
in
cooking
meat
by
boiling
a
grayish
scum
appears
on
the
surface
just
before
the
boiling
point
is
reached
this
scum
is
caused
by
the
gradual
extraction
of
a
part
of
the
soluble
albumin
that
is
present
in
the
hollow
fibers
of
the
muscle
tissue
after
its
extraction
it
is
coagulated
by
the
heat
in
the
water
as
it
coagulates
and
rises
it
carries
with
it
to
the
top
particles
of
dirt
and
other
foreign
material
present
in
the
water
or
on
the
surface
of
the
meat
in
addition
this
scum
contains
a
little
blood
which
is
extracted
and
coagulated
and
which
tends
to
make
it
grayish
in
color
such
scum
should
be
skimmed
off
as
it
is
unappetizing
in
appearance
whether
the
meat
should
be
put
into
cold
water
or
boiling
water
depends
on
the
result
that
is
desired
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
rich
tasty
broth
and
at
the
same
time
have
a
juicy
piece
of
boiled
meat
if
meat
is
cooked
for
the
purpose
of
making
soup
or
broth
it
should
be
put
into
cold
water
and
then
brought
to
a
boil
by
this
method
some
of
the
nutritive
material
and
much
of
the
flavoring
substance
will
be
drawn
out
before
the
water
becomes
hot
enough
to
harden
them
however
in
case
only
the
meat
is
to
be
used
it
should
be
plunged
directly
into
boiling
water
in
order
to
coagulate
the
surface
at
once
as
in
the
application
of
dry
heat
if
it
is
allowed
to
boil
for
minutes
or
so
and
the
temperature
then
reduced
the
coating
that
is
formed
will
prevent
the
nutritive
material
and
the
flavor
from
being
lost
to
any
great
extent
but
if
the
action
of
the
boiling
water
is
permitted
to
continue
during
the
entire
time
of
cooking
the
tissues
will
become
tough
and
dry
stewing
or
the
cheap
cuts
of
meat
which
contain
a
great
deal
of
flavor
and
are
so
likely
to
be
tough
can
not
be
prepared
by
the
quick
methods
of
cookery
nor
by
the
application
of
high
temperature
for
the
result
would
be
a
tough
indigestible
and
unpalatable
dish
the
long
slow
cooking
at
a
temperature
lower
than
boiling
point
which
is
known
as
stewing
or
simmering
should
be
applied
in
fact
no
better
method
for
the
preparation
of
tough
pieces
of
meat
and
old
fowl
can
be
found
than
this
process
for
by
it
the
connective
tissue
and
the
muscle
fibers
are
softened
if
the
method
is
carried
out
in
a
tightly
closed
vessel
and
only
a
small
amount
of
liquid
is
used
there
is
no
appreciable
loss
of
flavor
except
that
carried
into
the
liquid
in
which
the
meat
cooks
but
since
such
liquid
is
always
used
the
meat
being
usually
served
in
it
as
in
the
case
of
stews
there
is
no
actual
loss
to
secure
the
best
results
in
the
use
of
this
method
the
meat
should
be
cut
into
small
pieces
so
as
to
expose
as
much
surface
as
possible
then
the
pieces
should
be
put
into
cold
water
rather
than
hot
in
order
that
much
of
the
juices
and
flavoring
materials
may
be
dissolved
when
this
has
been
accomplished
the
temperature
should
be
gradually
raised
until
it
nearly
reaches
the
boiling
point
if
it
is
kept
at
this
point
for
several
hours
the
meat
will
become
tender
and
juicy
and
a
rich
tasty
broth
will
also
be
obtained
meat
cooked
by
the
method
of
braizing
which
is
in
reality
a
combination
of
stewing
and
baking
is
first
subjected
to
the
intense
dry
heat
of
the
oven
and
then
cooked
slowly
in
the
steam
of
the
water
that
surrounds
it
to
cook
meat
in
this
way
a
pan
must
be
used
that
will
permit
the
meat
to
be
raised
on
a
rack
that
extends
above
a
small
quantity
of
water
by
this
method
a
certain
amount
of
juice
from
the
meat
is
taken
up
by
the
water
but
the
connective
tissue
is
well
softened
unless
the
cooking
is
done
at
too
high
a
temperature
as
has
already
been
learned
fricasseeing
is
a
combination
of
sautéing
and
stewing
the
sautéing
coagulates
the
surface
proteins
and
prevents
to
some
extent
the
loss
of
flavor
that
would
occur
in
the
subsequent
stewing
if
the
surface
were
not
hardened
to
produce
a
tender
tasty
dish
fricasseeing
should
be
a
long
slow
process
this
method
is
seldom
applied
to
tender
expensive
cuts
of
meat
and
to
young
chickens
but
is
used
for
fowl
and
for
pieces
of
meat
that
would
not
make
appetizing
dishes
if
prepared
by
a
quicker
method
time
required
for
cooking
meat
the
length
of
time
required
for
cooking
various
kinds
of
meat
is
usually
puzzling
to
those
inexperienced
in
cookery
the
difference
between
a
dry
hard
beef
roast
and
a
tender
moist
juicy
one
is
due
to
the
length
of
time
allowed
for
cooking
overdone
meats
of
any
kind
are
not
likely
to
be
tasty
therefore
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
dry
heat
is
used
as
in
baking
roasting
broiling
the
longer
the
heat
is
applied
the
greater
will
be
the
evaporation
of
moisture
and
the
consequent
shrinkage
in
the
meat
a
general
rule
for
cooking
meat
in
the
oven
is
to
allow
minutes
for
each
pound
and
minutes
extra
if
it
is
to
be
cooked
by
broiling
allow
minutes
for
each

general
characteristics
of
beef
as
is
generally
known
beef
is
the
flesh
of
a
slaughtered
steer
cow
or
other
adult
bovine
animal
these
animals
may
be
sold
to
be
slaughtered
as
young
as
to
years
old
but
beef
of
the
best
quality
is
obtained
from
them
when
they
are
from
to
years
of
age
ranging
from
the
highest
quality
down
to
the
lowest
beef

designated
by
the
butcher
as
prime
extra
fancy
fancy
extra
choice
choice
good
and
poor
in
a
market
where
trade
is
large
and
varied
it
is
possible
to
make
such
use
of
meat
as
to
get
a
higher
price
for
the
better
qualities
than
can
be
obtained
in
other
markets
when
the
quality
of
beef
is
to
be
determined
the
amount
quality
and
color
of
the
flesh
bone
and
fat
must
be
considered
the
surface
of
a
freshly
cut
piece
of
beef
should
be
bright
red
in
color
when
it
is
exposed
to
the
air
for
some
time
the
action
of
the
air
on
the
blood
causes
it
to
become
darker
but
even
this
color
should
be
a
good
clear
red
any
unusual
color
is
looked
on
with
suspicion
by
a
person
who
understands
the
requirements
of
good
meat
to
obtain
beef
of
the
best
quality
it
should
be
cut
crosswise
of
the
fiber
in
fact
the
way
in
which
meat
is
cut
determines
to
a
great
extent
the
difference
between
tender
and
tough
meat
and
consequently
the
price
that
is
charged
this
difference
can
be
readily
seen
by
examining
the
surface
of
a
cut
it
will
be
noted
that
the
tender
parts
are
made
up
of
short
fibers
that
are
cut
directly
across
at
right
angles
with
the
surface
of
the
meat
while
the
tougher
parts
contain
long
fibers
that
run
either
slanting
or
almost
parallel
to
the
surface
the
amount
of
bone
and
cartilage
in
proportion
to
meat
in
a
cut
of
beef
usually
makes
a
difference
in
price
and
determines
the
usefulness
of
the
piece
to
the
housewife
therefore
these
are
matters
that
should
be
carefully
considered
for
instance
a
certain
cut
of
beef
that
is
suitable
for
a
roast
may
cost
a
few
cents
less
than
another
cut
but
if
its
proportion
of
bone
to
meat
is
greater
than
in
the
more
expensive
piece
nothing
is
gained
by
purchasing
it
bones
however
possess
some
value
and
can
be
utilized
in
various
ways
those
containing
which
is
the
soft
tissue
found
in
the
cavities
of
bones
and
composed
largely
of
fat
are
more
valuable
for
soup
making
and
for
stews
and
gravies
than
are
solid
bones
in
young
beef
in
good
condition
the
fat
is
creamy
white
in
color
however
as
the
animal
grows
older
the
color
grows
darker
until
it
becomes
a
deep
yellow
besides
the
flesh
bone
and
fat
the
general
shape
and
thickness
of
a
piece
of
beef
should
be
noted
when
its
quality
is
to
be
determined
in
addition
its
adaptability
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
selected
and
the
method
of
cookery
to
be
used
in
its
preparation
are
also
points
that
should
not
be
overlooked

illustration
fig
with
the
general
characteristics
of

well
in
mind
the
housewife
is
prepared
to
learn
of
the
way
in
which
the
animal
is
cut
to
produce
the
different
pieces
that
she
sees
in
the

the
names
that

the

as
well
as
the
naming
of
the
pieces
varies
in
different
localities
but
the
difference
is
not
sufficient
to

confusing
therefore
if
the
information

thoroughly
mastered
the
housewife
will
be
able
to
select

intelligently
in
whatever
section
of

country
she
may
reside
an
important
point
for
her
to
remember
concerning
meat
of
any
kind
is
that
the
cheaper
cuts
are
found
near
the
neck
legs
and
shins

that
the
pieces
increase
in
price

they

out
the
pork
and
brown
the
entire

thus
obtained
then
place
the
meat
on
a
rack
in
a
deep
granite
pan
an
earthen
bowl
or
a
baking
dish
and
surround
it
with
the
diced
vegetables

the
boiling
water
cover
the
dish
tight
and
place
in
a
slow
oven
bake
for
about
hours
at
a
low
temperature
then
remove
the
meat
to
a
hot
platter
strain
out
the
vegetables
and
make
a
thickened
gravy
of
the
liquid
that
remains
as
explained
later
the
usual
and
probably
the
most
satisfactory
method
of
preparing
the
cheaper
cuts
of
beef
is
to
cook
them
in
a
heavy
iron
pot
over
a
slow
fire
for
several
hours
if
the
proper
attention
is
given
to
the
preparation
of
such
a
roast
usually
called
a
pot
roast
it
will
prove
a
very
appetizing
dish
potatoes
may
also
be
cooked
in
the
pot
with
the
meat
this
is
a
good
plan
to
follow
for
it
saves
fuel
and
at
the
same
time
offers
variety
in
the
cooking
of
potatoes
when
a
piece
of
beef
is
to
be
roasted
in
a
pot
try
out
in
the
pot
a
little
of
the
beef
fat
then
wipe
the
meat
carefully
and
brown
it
on
all
sides
in
the
fat
add
salt
pepper
and
cupful
of
boiling
water
and
cover
the
pot
tightly
cook
over
a
slow
fire
until
the
water
is
evaporated
and
the
meat
begins
to
brown
then
add
another
cupful
of
water
continue
to
do
this
until
the
meat
has
cooked
for
several
hours
or
until
the
entire
surface
is
well
browned
and
the
meat
tissue
very
tender
then
place
the
meat
on
a
hot
platter
and
if
desired
make
gravy
of
the
fat
that
remains
in
the
pan
following
the
directions
given
later
if
potatoes
are
to
be
cooked
with
the
roast
put
them
into
the
pot
around
the
meat

minutes
before
the
meat
is
to
be
removed

advantage
to
procure
a

portion
of
a
quarter
of
beef

which
may
be
corned
and
kept
to
be
used
after
the
fresh
beef
has
been
eaten

plan
should
be
followed
only
in
cold
weather

prepare
a

the
process

in

when

stuffed
if
a
stuffed
meat
is
desired
nothing
more
appetizing
can
be
found
than
stuffed
heart
for
this
purpose
the
heart
of
a
young
beef
should
be
selected
in
order
that
a
tender
dish
will
result
after
washing
the
heart
and
removing
the
veins
and
the
arteries
make
a
stuffing
like
that
given
for

set
it
in
a

and
bake
slowly
for
or
hours
depending
on
the
size
of
the
heart
add
water
as
the
water
in
the
pan
evaporates
and
baste
the
heart
frequently
when
it
has
baked
sufficiently
remove
to
a
platter
and
serve
at
once
making
gravy
to
meats
prepared
in
various
ways
gravy
that
is
the
sauce
made
from
the
drippings
or
juices
that
cook
out
of
steaks
roasts
and
stews
or
from
the
broth
actually
cooked
from
the
meat
as
for
soup
is
a
valuable
addition
particularly
if
it
is
well
made
and
properly
seasoned
a
point
to
remember
in
this
connection
is
that
gravy
should
be
entirely
free
from
lumps
and
not
too
thick
it
will
be
of
the
right
thickness
if
to
level
tablespoonfuls
of
flour
is
used
for
each
pint
of
liquid
it
should
also
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
best
gravy
is
made
from
the
brown
drippings
that
contain
some
fat
to
make
gravy
remove
any
excess
of
fat
that
is
not
required
and
then
pour
a
little
hot
water
into
the
pan
in
order
to
dissolve
the
drippings
that
are
to
be
used
add
the
flour
to
the
fat
stirring
until
a
smooth
paste
is
formed
then
add
the
liquid
which
may
be
water
or
milk
and
stir
quickly
to
prevent
the
formation
of
lumps
season
well
with
salt
and
pepper
another
method
that
also
proves
satisfactory
is
to
mix
the
flour
and
liquid
and
then
add
them
to
the
fat
that
remains
in
the
pan
in
which
the
meat
has
been
cooked
trying
out
suet
and
other
fats
the
suet
obtained
from
beef
is
a
valuable
source
of
fat
for
cooking
and
it
should
therefore
never
be
thrown
away
the
process
of
obtaining
the
fat
from
suet
is
called
and
it
is
always
practiced
in
homes
where
economy
is
the
rule
to
try
out
suet
cut
the
pieces
into
cubes
place
them
in
a
heavy
frying
pan
and
cover
them
with
hot
water
allow
this
to
come
to
a
boil
and
cook
until
the
water
has
evaporated
continue
the
heating
until
all
the
fat
has
been
drawn
from
the
tissue
then
pour
off
all
the
liquid
fat
and
squeeze
the
remaining
suet
with
a
potato
masher
or
in
a
fruit
press
clean
glass
or
earthen
jars
are
good
receptacles
in
which
to
keep
the
fat
thus
recovered
from
the
suet
to
try
out
other
fats
proceed
in
the
same
way
as
for
trying
out
suet
such
fats
may
be
tried
by
heating
them
in
a
pan
without
water
provided
the
work
is
done
carefully
enough
to
prevent
them
from
scorching
preparation
of
beef
as
has
been
shown
meat
is
both
an
expensive
and
a
perishable
food
therefore
some
use
should
be
made
of
every
bit
of
it
no
matter
how
small
and
it
should
be
disposed
of
quickly
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
spoiling
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked
in
the
use
of
meats
however
is
that
they
should
be
prepared
so
as
to
be
a
contrast
to
the
original
preparation
and
thus
avoid
monotony
in
the
food
served
this
variation
may
be
accomplished
by
adding
other
foods
and
seasonings
and
by
changing
the
appearance
as
much
as
possible
for
instance
what
remains
from
a
roast
of
beef
may
be
cut
in
thin
slices
and
garnished
to
make
an
attractive
dish
or
meat
may
be
made
very
appetizing
by
cutting
it
into
cubes
reheating
it
in
gravy
or
white
sauce
and
serving
it
over
toast
or
potato
patties
then
there
is
the
sandwich
which
always
finds
a
place
in
the
luncheon
the
meat
used
for
this
purpose
may
be
sliced
thin
or
it
may
be
chopped
fine
and
then
to
increase
the
quantity
mixed
with
salad
dressing
celery
olives
chopped
pickles
etc
an
excellent
sandwich
is
made
by
placing
thin
slices
of
roast
beef
between
two
slices
of
bread
and
serving
hot
gravy
over
the
sandwich

formed

the

an
important
point
to
remember
is
that
meat
of
this
kind
always
requires
thorough
cooking
it
should
never
be
served
rare
because
of
the
long
cooking
veal
needs
together
with
the
difficulty
encountered
in
chewing
it
and
its
somewhat
insipid
flavor
which
fails
to
excite
the
free
flow
of
gastric
juice
this
meat
is
more
indigestable
than
beef
in
order
to
render
it
easier
to
digest
since
it
must
be
thoroughly
cooked
the
long
slow
methods
of
cookery
should
be
selected
as
these
soften
the
connective
tissue
because
of
the
lack
of
flavor
veal
is
not
so
good
as
beef
when
the
extraction
of
flavor
is
desired
for
broth
however
the
absence
of
flavor
makes
veal
a
valuable
meat
to
combine
with
chicken
and
the
more
expensive
meats
particularly
in
highly
seasoned
made
dishes
or
salads
although
lacking
in
flavor
veal
contains
more
gelatine
than
other
meats
while
this
substance
is
not
very
valuable
as
a
food
it
lends
body
to
soup
or
broth
and
assists
in
the
preparation
of
certain
made
dishes
to
supply
the
flavor
needed
in
dishes

this
kind

however
a
thin

cut
from
the

as
shown
in
fig
while
in
reality
a
steak
is
considered
by
most
housewives
and
butchers
as
a
cutlet
a

several
methods
of
preparing

a
very
satisfactory
one
is
to
them
this
method
prevents

from

as
has

the
first

in

however
is
the

for

when

is
understood
it
will
be
a
simple
matter
to
make
up
attractive
dishes
in
which
sweetbreads
are
used
it
is
generally
advisable
to
buy
sweetbreads
in
pairs
as
the
heart
and
throat
sweetbreads
are
preferable
to
the
one
that
lies
near
the
stomach
sweetbreads
spoil
very
quickly
therefore
as
soon
as
they
are
brought
into
the
kitchen
put
them
in
cold
water
and
allow
them
to
remain
there
for
hour
or
more
then
put
them
to

them
after
which
place
them
in
cold
water
again
unless
they
are
to
be
used
immediately
keep
them
in
cold

as
this
will
prevent
them
from
discoloring

term
mutton
is

the
flesh
of
a
sheep
that
is

or
more
old
while
lamb
is
the
flesh
of
sheep
under

the
popularity
of
these
meats
varies
very
much
with
the
locality
in
the

a
preference
for
lamb
has
become
noticeable
but
in
england
mutton
is
more
popular
and
is
more
commonly
used
both
of
these
meats
however
are
very
palatable
and
nutritious
so
that
the
choice
of
one
or
the
other
will
always
be
determined
by
the
taste
or
market
conditions

mutton
differs
from
lamb
very
much
as
beef
differs
from
veal
or
as
the
meat
of
any
other
mature
animal
differs
from
a
young

of
the

kind
in
mutton
there
is
a
smaller
percentage
of
water
and
a
larger
percentage
of
fat
protein
extractives
and
flavoring
substances
there
is
also
a
difference
in
the
appearance
of
these
two
meats
lamb
is
pink
and
contains
only
small
amounts
of
fat
while
mutton
is
brick
red
and
usually
has
considerable
firm
white
fat
the
bones
of

are
pink
while
those
of
mutton
are
white
the
outside
of

is
covered
with
a
thin
white
skin
that
becomes
pink
in
mutton
the
size
of
the

often
aids
in
distinguishing
between
these
two
meats

varies
in
different
localities
but
as
a
rule
the
method
illustrated

distinguishing
features
of
when
the
uses
of
the

to
be
considered

must
be
given
to
the
anatomy
of
the
animal
and
the
exercise
that
the
different
parts
have
received
during
life
this
is
important
because
the
continued
action
of
the
muscles
tends
to
make
the
flesh
tough
but
at
the
same
time
it
increases
the
amount
of
extractives
or
flavoring
material
therefore
meat
taken
from
a
part
that
has
been
subjected
to
much
muscular
action
is
likely
to
need
longer
cooking
than

object
in

this
can
be
accomplished
by
cutting
up

into
small
pieces
so

increase
the
amount

by
keeping
the
temperature

pork
general
characteristics
of
pork
pork
is
the
flesh
of
slaughtered
swine
used
as
food
it
is
believed
to
be
more
indigestible
than
other
meats
but
if
it
is
obtained
from
a
young
and
properly
fed
animal
it
is
not
only
digestible
but
highly
appetizing
and
when
eaten
occasionally
it
is
very
wholesome
the
age
of
the
animal
from
which
pork
is
cut
can
be
determined
by
the
thickness
of
the
skin
the
older
the
animal
the
thicker
the
skin
to
be
of
the
best
kind
pork
should
have
pink
not
red
flesh
composed
of
tissues
and
its
fat
which
in
a
animal
equals
about
of
the
entire
weight
should
be
white
and
firm
although
all
cuts
of
pork
contain
some
fat
the
proportion
should
not
be
too
great
or
the
pieces
will
not
contain
as
much
lean
as
they
should
however
the
large
amount
of
fat
contained
in
pork
makes
its
food
value
higher
than
that
of
other
meats
unless
they
are
excessively
fat
and
consequently
difficult
of
digestion
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
pork
is
that
about
of
the
entire
dressed
animal
may
be
preserved
by
curing
and
smoking
originally
these
processes
required
a
period
of
to
months
for
their
completion
but
they
have
gradually
been
shortened
until
now
only
a
few
days
are
required
for
the
work
pork
cured
and
smoked
by
the
new
methods
however
does
not
possess
such
excellent
flavor
and
such
good
keeping
qualities
as
that
so
treated
by
the
longer
process
any
one
who
has
the
right
storage
facilities
to
care
for
the
meat
properly
will
find
it
much
more
economical
to
purchase
a
whole
carcass
or
a
part
of
one
and
then
salt
smoke
or
pickle
the
various
pieces
that
can
be
treated
in
this
way

needed

cuts

names
of

the
butcher
usually
buys
a
whole
carcass
of
pork
he
first
divides
it
into
halves

splitting
it

then
cuts

the
best
quality

however

made
from
the
fat

this
is
called
because
the
pieces

are
similar
in

to
leaves
such
lard
has
a
higher
melting
point

is
more
flaky
than
that
made
from

the

of
pork
does
not
contain
a
great

as
the
quality
of
this

is
very
good
it
is
valuable

a

roast
in
the

several
points

be
taken
into
consideration
unlike

rare
pork
must
be
well
done
in

to
be

rare
pork
to
most
persons
is
repulsive
also
as
a
large
part
of
the
surface
of
a
pork
roast
especially
one
cut
from
the
shoulder
loin
or
ribs
is
covered
with
a
layer
of
fat
pork

not
have
to
be
seared
to
prevent
the
loss
of
juice
nor
does
it
have
to
be
put
into
such
a
hot
oven
as
that
required
for
beef
in
fact
if
the
temperature
of
the
oven
is
very
high
the
outside
will
finish
cooking
before
the
heat
has
had
a
chance
to
penetrate
sufficiently
to
cook
the
center
while
this
makes
no
difference
with
meat
that
does
not
need
to
be
thoroughly
cooked
it
is
a
decided
disadvantage
in
the
case
of
pork
when
a
shoulder
of
pork
is
to
be
roasted
it
makes
a
very
satisfactory
dish
if
it
is
boned
and
stuffed
before
roasting
to
bone
such
a
piece
run
a
long
narrow
knife
all
around
the
bone
and
cut
it
loose
then
pick
up
the
bone
by
one
end
and
shake
it
until
it
will
pull
out
fill
the
opening
thus
formed
with
bread
or
cracker
stuffing
if
an
especially
inviting
roast
of
pork
is
desired
a
should
be
selected
for
this
is
just
as
attractive
as
a
crown
roast
of
lamb
it
is
made
by
cutting
corresponding
pieces
from
each
side
of
the
rib
piece
trimming
the

far
back
as
the
lean
part
of

is
very
attractive
for
such
a

aids
considerably
in

for
it
cuts
the
large

roast
in
some
households
roasted
pig
is
the
favorite
meat
for
the
thanksgiving
or
the
christmas
dinner
there
is
sufficient
reason
for
its
popularity
for
when
properly
prepared
and
attractively
garnished
roasted
pig
offers
a
pleasing
change
from
the
meat
usually
served
on
such
days
to
be
suitable
for
roasting
a
pig
should
be
not
more
than
month
or
weeks
old
and
should
not
weigh
more
than
or
pounds
after
it
is
cleaned
the
butcher
should
prepare
it
for
cooking
by
scalding
off
the
hair
washing
the
pig
thoroughly
inside
and
out
and
withdrawing
the
entrails
of
the
animal
through
an
incision
made
in
the
under
part
of
the
body
when
the
pig
is
received
in
the
home
wash
it
thoroughly
within
and
without
wipe
it
dry
and
fill
it
with
stuffing
to
make
a
stuffing
suitable
for
this
purpose
season
quarts
of
fine
bread
crumbs
with
tablespoonfuls
of
chopped
onion
teaspoonfuls
of
salt
teaspoonful
of
pepper
and
cupful
of
melted
butter
mix
thoroughly
and
add
beaten
eggs
if
the
stuffing
needs
moisture
add
water
or
milk
stuff
the
pig
firmly
with
this
stuffing
using
every
effort
to
restore
its
original
shape
then
sew
up
the
opening
and
truss
the
animal

and
bend
the

wipe

later
with
drippings
when
the
skin
begins
to
brown
slightly

over
it
a
clean
piece
of
cloth
dipped
in
melted
butter
repeat
this
operation
every
minutes
until
the
meat
is

done
then
remove
the

to
a
hot
platter
and
garnish
with
parsley

baked
apples
if
a
more
ornamental
garnishing
is
desired
place
a

so
as
to
form
chops
sautéd
or
broiled
slices
cut
from
the
ribs
and
loin
of
pork
are
called
chops
and
those
obtained
from
the
shoulder
and
hind
legs
are
called
steaks
these
together
with
the
tenderloin
the
small
piece
of
lean
tender
meat
lying
under
the
bones
of
the
loin
and
seldom
weighing
more
than
a
pound
are
especially
suitable
for
sautéing
or
broiling
when
they
are
to
be
prepared
by
these
processes
sauté
or
broil
them
as
any
other
meat
remembering
however
that
pork
must
be
well
done
because
of
this
fact
a
more
moderate
temperature
must
be
employed
than
that
used
for
beefsteak
pork
chops
in
tomato
a
slight
change
from
the
usual
way
of
preparing
pork
chops
can
be
had
by
cooking
them
with
tomatoes
the
combination
of
these
two
foods
produces
a
dish
having
a
very
agreeable
flavor
first
brown
the
chops
in
their
own
fat
in
a
frying
pan
turning
them
frequently
so
that
the
surfaces
will
become
evenly
browned
when
they
have
cooked
for
minutes
pour
enough
strained
stewed
tomatoes
over
them
to
cover
them
well
and
season
with
salt
and
pepper
cover
the
pan
tight
and
allow
them
to
simmer
until
the
tomatoes
become
quite
thick
place
the
chops
on
a
hot
platter
pour
the
tomato
sauce
over
them
and
serve
hot
sautéd
tenderloin
of
since
the
tenderloin
of
pork
is
a
very
tender
piece
of
meat
it
needs
no
accompaniment
to
make
it
a
delicious
dish
but
sometimes
a
change
of
preparation
is
welcomed
in
order
to
give
variety
to
the
diet
the
accompanying
directions
should
therefore
be
followed
when
something
different
from
broiled
tenderloin
is
desired
cut
the
tenderloin
into
lengthwise
slices
and
brown
these
slices
in
melted
butter
turning
them
several
times
then
remove
to
a
cooler
part
of
the
stove
and
let
them
cook
slowly
in
the
butter
for
minutes
taking
care
to
have
them
closely
covered
and
turning
them
once
or
twice
so
that
they
will
cook
evenly
at
the
end
of
this
time
pour
enough
milk
or
cream
in
the
pan
to
cover
the
meat
well
and
cook
for
minutes
longer
with
a
skimmer
remove
the
meat
which
should
be
very
tender
by
this
time
from
the
pan
and
put
it
where
it
will
keep
hot
make
a
gravy
of
the
drippings
that
remain
in
the
pan
by
thickening
it
with
tablespoonful
of
flour
stirring
it
until
it
is
thick
and
smooth
and
seasoning
it
to
taste
with
salt
and

pour
the
gravy
over
the
meat

occasionally
it

that
therefore
cook

added
pork
of
this
kind
is
usually
bought
by

sliced
by
the

as
it
is
needed
for
cooking
purposes
illustration

the
middle
cut
of
pork
upon
being
cured
by
smoking

regarded
as
bacon
it
is
sometimes
used
for
larding
purposes
but
as
it
contains
more
lean
than

pork
has
a
very
pleasing
flavor

the
most
easily
digested

known
it

much
used

a
piece
that
contains
the
usual
proportion
of

excellent
for
use
in
the
cooking
and
seasoning
of
other
foods
such
as
vegetables
and
meats
when
bacon
is
cooked
for
the
table
its
flavor
will
be
improved
if
it
is
broiled
rather
than
fried
in
its
own

the
rind
of
bacon
should
as
a
rule
be
trimmed
off
but
it
should
never
be
wasted
for
it
may
be
used
to
grease
a
pancake
griddle
or
any
pan
in
which
food
is
to
be
cooked
provided
the
bacon
flavor
will
not
be
objectionable
in
purchasing
bacon
it
is
usually
more
economical
to
buy
the
whole

or
the
entire
middle
cut
but
if
smaller
quantities
are
desired
any
amount
either
in
one
piece

in
slices
may
be
bought
the
commercially
cut
bacon
which
is
very
thin
and
becomes
very
crisp
in
its
preparation
may
be
bought
with
the
rind
retained

removed
in
both
of
these
forms
it
is
often
put
up
in
jars
or
packed
neatly
in
flat
pasteboard
boxes
while
such
bacon
is
undoubtedly
the
most
popular
kind
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
more
preparation
that
is
put
on
such
a
food
before
it
enters
the
home
the
more
expensive
it
becomes
very
satisfactory
results
can
be
obtained
from

and
there
are
many
combinations
in
which
bacon
is
one
of
the
foods
but
no
more
palatable
one
can
be
found
than
bacon
and
eggs
this
is
generally
a
breakfast
dish
still
there
is
no
reason
why
it
can
not
be
used
at
times
for
luncheon
or
supper
to
give

to
prepare
this
combination
of
foods
first
the
desired
number
of
slices
of

then
remove
them
to

put
the

placing
a
slice
or
two
of
bacon
on
the
plate
with
each
egg
bacon
combined
with
other
many
other
foods
may
be
fried
in
the
same
way
as
eggs
and
served
with
bacon
for
instance
sliced
apples
or
sliced
tomatoes
fried
in
bacon
fat
until
they
become
tender
but
not
mushy
are
delicious
when
served
with
crisp
pieces
of
bacon
also
cold
cereals
such
as
cream
of
wheat
oatmeal
mush
may
be
sliced
and
fried
until
crisp
and
then
served
with

the
hind
leg
of
pork

is
usually
known
as
ham
fig

a
ham
from
which
the
rind
has
not
been
removed
in
such
a
ham
the
proportion
of
fat
and
lean
is
about
right
but
when
ham
is
bought
with
the
rind
removed
much
of
the
fat
is
also
taken
off
the
best
hams
weigh
from
to
pounds
and
have
a
thin
skin
solid
fat
and
a
small
short
tapering
leg
or
shank
several
ways
of
cooking
ham
are
in
practice
very
often
slices
resembling
slices
of
round
steak
are
cut
from
the
whole
ham
and
then
fried
or
broiled
if
a
larger
quantity
is
desired
the
entire
ham
or
a
thick
cut
may
be
purchased
this
is
boiled
or
baked
and
then
served
hot
or
cold
it
is
a
good
idea
to
purchase
an
entire
ham
and
keep
it
in
supply
cutting
off
slices
as
they
are
desired
in
such
an
event
the
ham
should
be
kept
carefully
wrapped
and
should
be
hung
in
a
cool
dry
place
in
cutting
a
ham
begin
at
the
large
end
as
in
fig
and
cut
off
slices
until
the
opposite
end
becomes
too
small
to
make
good
slices
the
piece
that
remains
may
be
cooked
with
vegetables
may
be
boiled
and
served
either
hot

if
it
is

broiled
the
methods
of
broiling
and
pan
broiling
are
very
satisfactory
when
applied
to
ham
that
is
cut
in
slices
ham
is
in
the
same
way
as
other
meats
to
broil
ham
place
slices
inch
thick
on
the
hot
broiler
rack
and
sear
quickly
on
both
sides
then
reduce
the
temperature
and
broil
for
to
minutes
turning
the
ham
every
few
minutes
until
done
remove
to

little
water

the
drippings

baked
in
a
change
from
the
usual
ways
of
preparing
slices
of
ham
can
be
had
by
baking
them
in
milk
a
point
to
remember
in
carrying
out
this
method
is
that
the
meat
must
bake
slowly
in
order
to
be
tender
when
it
is
done
secure
a
slice
of

place
it

oven
and
cook
for

more
hours
when
the
ham
is
done
its
surface
should
be
brown
and
the
milk
should
be
almost
entirely
evaporated
if
the
liquid
added
in
the
beginning
is
not
sufficient
more
may
be
added

an
entire
ham
particularly
when
a
large
number
of
persons
are
to
be
served
the
usual
way
to
prepare
a
whole
ham
is
to
boil
it
when
it
is
sufficiently
cooked
it
may
be
served
hot
or
kept
until
it
is
cold
and
then
served
in
slices
nothing
is
more
appetizing
for
a
light
meal
as
luncheon
or
supper
or
for
picnic
lunches
than
cold
sliced
ham
then
too
boiled
ham
is
very
delicious
when
it
is
fried
until
the
edges
are
crisp
to
prepare
boiled
ham
first
soak
the
ham
in
cold
water
for
several
hours
and
then
remove
it
and
scrub
it
place
it
in
a
large
kettle
with
the
fat
side
down
and
cover
well
with
cold
water
put
over
a
slow
fire
and
allow
to
come
to
the
boiling
point
very
slowly
boil
for
minutes
and
skim
off
the
scum
that
has
risen
simmer
slowly
for
about
hours
or
at
least
minutes
for
each
pound
of
ham
take
from
the
kettle
and
remove
the
skin
about
of
the
way
back
it
will
be
found
that
the
skin
will
peel
off
easily
when
the
ham
is
cooked
enough
garnish
in
any
desirable
way
and
serve
hot
or
cold
baked
another
very
appetizing
way
in
which
to
cook
an
entire
ham
is
to
bake
it
this
involves
both
cooking
in
water
on
the
top
of
the
stove
and
baking
in
the
oven
while
this
recipe
as
well
as
those
preceding
specifies
ham
it
should
be
remembered
that
shoulder
may
be
cooked
in
the
same
ways
for
baked
ham
proceed
in
the
way
just
explained
for
boiled
ham
but
boil
only
minutes
for
each
pound
take
the
ham
from
the
kettle
and
allow
it
to
cool
enough
to
permit
it
to
be
handled
remove
the
skin
then
place
the
ham
in
a
roasting
pan
and
pour
over
it
cupful
of
water

the
housewife
to
use
up

and
fried
apples
to
prepare
this
dish
remove
the
cores
from
sour
apples
and
cut
the

it
can
be
combined
with

that
is
a
very
good

serving
and
carving
of
meat
the
manner
of
carving
and
serving
meat
in
the
home
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
kind
of
meat
that
is
to
be
served
a
way
that
is
favored
by
some
is
to
carve
the
meat
before
it
is
placed
on
the
table
and
then
serve
it
according
to
the
style
of
service
used
however
the
preferable
way
is
to
place
the
platter
containing
the
meat
on
the
table
together
with
the
plates
in
front
of
the
person
who
is
to
do
the
carving
and
serving
the
carver
should
use
considerable
care
in
cutting
and
serving
the
meat
so
that
the
platter
and
the
surrounding
tablecloth
will
not
become
unsightly
to
make
each
portion
as
attractive
as
possible
it
should
be
cut
off
evenly
and
then
placed
on
the
plate
with
the
best
side
up
furthermore
the
carving
should
be
done
in
an
economical
way
in
order
that
whatever
remains
after
the
first
serving
may
be
served
later
in
the
same
meal
and
what
is
not
eaten
at
the
first
meal
may
be
utilized
to
advantage
for
another
to
obtain
the
best
results
in
carving
a
good
carving
knife
should
be
secured
and
it
should
always
be
kept
well
sharpened
with
the
general
directions
clear
in

the
methods
of

however
need
proper
cutting
in
order
that
equally
good
pieces
may
be
served
to
each
person
dining
to
carve
a
steak
properly
cut
it
across
from
side
to
side
so
that
each
piece
will
contain
a
portion
of
the
tender
part
as
well
as
a
share
of
the
tougher
part
when
cut
the
pieces
should
be
strips
that
are
about
as
wide
as
the
steak
is
thick
it
is
often
advisable
to
remove
the
bone
from
some
steaks
before
placing
them
on
the
table
roasts
require
somewhat
more
attention
than
steaks
before
they
are
placed
on
the
table
any
cord
used
for
tying
should
be
cut
and
removed
and
all
skewers
inserted
to
hold
the
meat
in
shape
should
be
pulled
out
to
carve
a
roast
of
any
kind
run
the
fork
into
the
meat
deeply
enough
to
hold
it
firmly
and
then
cut
the
meat
into
thin
slices
across
the
grain
in
the
case
of
a
roast
leg
that
contains
the
bone
begin
to
carve
the
meat
from

and
then
off
so
that
the
bone
is
left

and
rolled
roasts
on
the
platter
so
that
the
tissue
side
and
not
the

side
is
up
and
then
cut
the
slices
off
in
a
horizontal
direction

sausages
and
meat
preparations
in
addition
to
the
fresh
raw
meats
that
the
housewife
can
procure
for
her
family
there
are
on
the
market
numerous
varieties
of
raw
smoked
cooked
and
partly
cooked
meats
which
are
generally
included
under
the
term
sausages
these
meats
are
usually
highly
seasoned
so
they
keep
better
than
do
fresh
meats
they
should
not
be
overlooked
by
the
housewife
for
they
help
to
simplify
her
labor
and
at
the
same
time
serve
to
give
variety
to
the
family
diet
still
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
meats
are
made
ready
for
use
before
they
are
put
on
the
market
the
cost
of
the
labor
involved
in
their
manufacture
is
added
to
the
price
charged
for
them
for
this
reason
the
housewife
must
be
prepared
to
pay
more
for
meats
of
this
kind
than
she
would
pay
if
she
could
prepare
them
at
home
however
she
need
not
be
concerned
regarding
their
safety
for
the
government
inspection
and
regulations
prevent
any
adulteration
of
them
among
the
numerous
varieties
of
these
meats
many
of
them
are
typical
of
certain
localities
while
others
have
a
national
or
an
international
reputation
they
also
vary
in
the
kind
of

used
to

some
of

are
made
from

certain
kinds

made
from
the
livers
of
certain
animals
and
may
be
purchased
loose
or
in
skins
some
of
these
sausages
are
used
so
often
in
certain
combinations
of
foods
that
they
are
usually
thought
of
in
connection
with
the
foods
that
it
is
customary
for
them
to
accompany
frankfurters
and
sauerkraut
pork
sausage

mashed

liverwurst
and
fried

are
combinations
of
this
kind
closely
allied
to
these
sausages
although
not
one
of
them
is
a
meat
preparation
much
used
in
some
localities
and
known
as

prepared
by
cooking
the
head
of
pork
removing
the
meat
from
the

and
chopping

very
fine
the
pieces
of
meat
are
then
returned
to

broth
in
which
the

was
cooked
and
enough

such
as
of

can
usually
be
obtained
in

market
while
the
thrifty
housewife
does
not
make
a
habit
of
purchasing
meats
of
this
kind
regularly
there
are
times
when
they
are
a
great
convenience
and
also
afford
an
opportunity
to
vary
the

preparation
of
foods
by
frying
principles
of
frying
up
to
this
point
all
frying
of
foods
has
been
done
by
sautéing
them
that
is
frying
them
quickly
in
a
small
amount
of
fat
the
other
method
of
frying
which
involves
cooking
food
quickly
in
deep
fat
at
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
fahrenheit
is
used
so
frequently
in
the
preparation
of
many
excellent
meat
dishes
particularly
in
the
use
of
that
specific
directions
for
it
are
here
given
together
with
several
recipes
that
afford
practice
in
its
use
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
applying
this
method
to
these
recipes
or
to
other
recipes
if
the
underlying
principles
of
frying
are
thoroughly
understood
and
the
proper
utensils
for
this
work
are
secured
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
remembered
that
if
foods
prepared
in
this
way
are
properly
done
they
are
not
so
indigestible
as
they
are
oftentimes
supposed
to
be
but
that
incorrect
preparation
makes
for
indigestibility
in
the
finished
product
for
instance
allowing
the
food
to
soak
up
quantities
of
fat
during
the
frying
is
neither
economical
nor
conducive
to
a
digestible
dish
to
avoid
such
a
condition
it
is
necessary
that
the
mixture
to
be
fried
be
made
of
the
proper
materials
and
be
prepared
in
the
right
way
one
of
the
chief
requirements
is
that
the
surface
of
the
mixture
be
properly
coated
with
a
protein
material
such
as
egg
or
egg
and
milk
before
it
is
put
into
the
fat
or
that
the
mixture
contain
the
correct
proportion
of
egg
so
that
its
outside
surface
will
accomplish
the
same
purpose
the
reason
for
this
requirement
is
that
the
protein
material
is
quickly
coagulated
by
the
hot
fat
and
thus
prevents
the
entrance
of
fat
into
the
inside
material
of
the
fried
food
care
must
be
taken
also
in
the
selection
of
the
fat
that
is
used
for
frying
this
may
be
in
the
form
of
an
oil
or
a
solid
fat
and
may
be
either
a
vegetable
or
an
animal
fat
however
a
vegetable
fat
is
usually
preferred
as
less
smoke
results
from
it
and
less
flavor
of
the
fat
remains
in
the
food
after
it
is
cooked
illustration
fig
the
utensils
required
for
frying
are
shown
in
fig
they
consist
of
a
wire
basket
and
a
pan
into
which
the
basket
will
fit
as
will
be
observed
the
pan
in
which
the
fat
is
put
has
an
upright
metal
piece
on
the
side
opposite
the
handle
over
this
fits
a
piece
of
wire
with
which
the
basket
is
equipped
and
which
is
attached
to
the
side
opposite
the
handle
of
the
basket
this
arrangement
makes
it
possible
to
drain
the
fat
from
whatever
food
has
been
fried
without
having
to
hold
the

over
the
pan

the
actual
work
of

foods
by
this
method
may
be
taken
up
numerous
foods
and
preparations
may
be
subjected
to

of
cookery

attention
is
given
at
this

the
temperature
of

it
may
be
known
that

be
careful
to
regulate
the
heat
so

poultry
poultry
as
a
food
poultry
is
the
term
used
to
designate
birds
that
have
been
domesticated
or
brought
under
the
control
of
man
for
two
purposes
namely
the
eggs
they
produce
and
the
flesh
food
they
supply
all
the
common
species
of
domestic
fowls
chickens
ducks
geese
turkeys
guinea
fowls
and
pigeons
are
known
as
poultry
however
none
of
these
species
is
included
under
this
term
unless
it
is
raised
for
at
least
one
of
the
two
purposes
mentioned
as
the
term
is
to
be
understood
in
this
section
poultry
includes
all
domestic
fowls
that
are
killed
in
order
that
their
flesh
may
be
cooked
and
used
as
food
for
human
beings
of
course
many
wild
birds
are
killed
for
the
flesh
food
they
furnish
but
they
are
classed
under
the
term
poultry
is
probably
never
a
necessity
in
the
ordinary
dietary
and
when
prices
are
high
it
is
a
decided
luxury
still
it
does
aid
materially
in
relieving
the
monotony
of
the
usual
protein
foods
and
it
supplies
that
something
out
of
the
ordinary
for
special
occasions
then
too
it
is
often
valuable
in
the
diet
of
an
invalid
or
some
person
with
a
poor
appetite
poultry
is
of
course
used
more
in
some
homes
than
in
others
yet
there
is
scarcely
a
home
in
which
it
is
not
served
some
time
or
another
a
knowledge
of
this
food
and
its
preparation
and
serving
will
therefore
prove
to
be
a
valuable
asset
to
any
housewife
to
arrive
at
a
knowledge
of
the
use
of
poultry
as
a
food
the
housewife
must
necessarily
become
familiar
with
its
selection
and
purchase
then
she
must
give
attention
to
both
its
preparation
for
cooking
and
its
actual
cooking
and
finally
to
its
serving
in
all
these
matters
she
will
do
well
to
adhere
to
the
practice
of
economy
for
at
best
poultry
is
usually
an
expensive
food
before
entering
into
these
matters
in
detail
however
it
will
be
well
to
look
into
them
in
a
general
way
in
the
selection
of
poultry
the
housewife
should
realize
that
poultry
breeders
have
so
developed
certain
breeds
even
of
the
same
species
that
they
are
better
for
table
use
than
others
the
flesh
of
any
breed
of
poultry
may
be
improved
by
feeding
the
birds
good
food
and
giving
them
proper
care
and
it
is
by
applying
these
principles
that
the
breeders
are
enabled
to
better
the
quality
of
this
food
other
things
also
influence
the
quality
of
poultry
flesh
as
food
as
for
example
the
way
in
which
the
poultry
is
prepared
for
market
and
the
care
it
receives
in
transportation
and
storage
unless
these
are
as
they
should
be
they
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
poultry
because
such
food
is
decidedly
perishable
it
is
possible
to
exercise
economy
in
the
purchase
of
poultry
but
before
the
housewife
can
do
this
she
must
be
able
to
judge
the
age
of
each
kind
she
may
desire
on
the
age
depends
to
a
great
extent
the
method
of
cookery
to
be
followed
in
preparing
the
poultry
for
the
table
likewise
she
must
know
the
marks
of
poultry
as
well
as
those
of
poultry
that
is
freshly
killed
and
she
must
be
familiar
with
the
first
marks
of
deterioration
or
decay
that
result
from
storing
the
food
too
long
or
improperly
economy
may
also
be
practiced
in
preparing
poultry
for
cooking
to
bring
this
about
however
the
housewife
should
realize
that
the
best
method
of
preparing
any
kind
of
poultry
for
cooking
is
always
the
most
economical
it
means
too
that
she
should
understand
thoroughly
the
methods
of
drawing
and
cutting
so
that
she
may
either
do
this
work
herself
or
direct
it
the
way
in
which
poultry
is
cooked
has
a
bearing
on
the
cost
of
this
food
too
for
example
a
young
tender
bird
prepared
by
a
wrong
method
not
only
is
a
good
dish
spoiled
but
is
a
waste
of
expensive
material
likewise
an
older
bird
which
has
more
flavor
but
tougher
tissues
is
almost
impossible
as
food
if
it
is
not
properly
prepared
both
kinds
make
appetizing
dishes
and
do
not
result
in
waste
if
correct
methods
of
cooking
are
followed
in
their
preparation
even
the
way
in
which
poultry
is
served
has
a
bearing
on
the
cost
of
this
food
for
this
reason
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
to
carve
as
well
as
how
to
utilize
any
of
this
food
that
may
be
left
over
if
the
housewife
is
to
get
the
most
out
of
her
investment
selection
of
poultry
general
information
the
selection
of
any
kind
of
poultry
to
be
used
as
food
is
a
matter
that
should
not
be
left
to
the
butcher
rather
it
should
be
done
by
some
one
who
understands
the
purpose
for
which
the
poultry
is
to
be
used
and
in
the
home
this
is
a
duty
that
usually
falls
to
the
housewife
there
are
a
number
of
general
facts
about
poultry
and
a
knowledge
of
them
will
assist
the
housewife
greatly
in
performing
her
tasks
classification
of
poultry
breeders
and
dealers
divide
the
domestic
fowls
into
three
classes
in
the
first
class
are
included
those
which
have
combs
such
as
chickens
turkeys
and
guinea
fowls
quails
and
pheasants
belong
to
this
class
also
but
they
are
very
seldom
domesticated
the
birds
in
this
class
are
distinguished
by
two
kinds
of
tissue
light
meat
on
the
breast
and
dark
meat
on
the
other
parts
of
the
body
in
the
second
class
are
included
those
fowls
which
swim
such
as
ducks
and
geese
these
are
characterized
by
web
feet
and
long
thick
bills
and
their
meat
is
more
nearly
the
same
color
over
the
entire
body
the
third
class
is
comprised
of
birds
that
belong
to
the
family
of
doves
pigeons
which
are
called
when
used
as
food
are
the
only
domesticated
birds
of
this
class
they
stand
between
the
other
two
classes
with
respect
to
their
flesh
which
has
some
difference
in
color
between
the
breast
and
other
muscles
but
not
so
much
as
chicken
and
other
fowls
of
the
first
class
influence
of
feeding
and
care
on
to
some
extent
the
breed
affects
the
quality
of
poultry
as
food
still
this
is
a
far
less
important
matter
than
a
number
of
things
that
the
purchaser
is
better
able
to
judge
among
the
factors
that
greatly
influence
the
quality
are
the
feeding
and
care
that
the
birds
receive
up
to
the
time
of
slaughter
these
affect
not
only
the
flavor
and
the
tenderness
of
the
tissue
as
well
as
the
quantity
of
tissue
in
proportion
to
bone
but
also
the
healthfulness
of
the
birds
themselves
to
keep
the
birds
in
good
health
and
to
build
up
sufficient
flesh
to
make
them
plump
with
as
much
meat
as
possible
on
the
bones
and
a
fair
amount
of
fat
as
well
the
food
they
get
must
be
clean
and
of
the
right
kind
likewise
the
housing
conditions
must
be
such
that
the
birds
are
kept
dry
and
sufficiently
warm
the
living
space
also
must
be
adequate
for
the
number
that
are
raised
domestic
fowls
are
not
discriminating
as
to
their
food
and
when
they
are
forced
to
live
in
dirt
and
filth
they
will
eat
more
or
less
of
it
and
thus
injure
the
quality
of
their
flesh
poultry
that
comes
into
the
market
looking
drawn
and
thin
with
flesh
and
no
fat
shows
evidence
of
having
had
poor
living
conditions
and
inadequate
feeding
such
poultry
will
be
found
to
have
a
less
satisfactory
flavor
than
that
which
has
received
proper
care
effect
of
sex
on
when
birds
of
any
kind
are
young
sex
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
flesh
but
as
they
grow
older
the
flesh
of
males
develops
a
stronger
flavor
than
that
of
females
of
the
same
age
and
also
becomes
tougher
however
when
birds
with
the
exception
of
mature
ones
are
dressed
it
would
take
an
expert
to
determine
the
sex
the
mature
male
is
less
plump
than
the
female
and
it
is
more
likely
to
be
scrawny
likewise
its
spurs
are
larger
and
its
bones
are
large
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
flesh
on
them
very
often
the
reproductive
organs
of
young
males
are
removed
and
the
birds
are
then
called
as
the
capon
grows
to
maturity
it
develops
more
of
the
qualities
of
the
hen
its
body
becomes
plump
instead
of
angular
the
quality
of
its
flesh
is
much
better
than
that
of
the
cock
and
the
quantity
of
flesh
in
proportion
to
bone
is
much
greater
in
fact
the
weight
of
a
capon
edible
flesh
is
much
greater
than
that
of
either
a
hen
or
a
cock
in
the
market
a
dressed
capon
can
usually
be
told
by
the
long
tail
and
wing
feathers
that
are
left
on
as
well
as
by
a
ring
of
feathers
around
the
neck
female
birds
that
are
spayed
are
called
spaying
or
removing
the
reproductive
organs
of
female
birds
however
makes
so
little
improvement
that
it
is
seldom
done
preparation
of
poultry
for
the
manner
in
which
poultry
is
prepared
for
market
has
a
great
bearing
on
its
quality
as
food
in
some
cases
the
preparation
falls
to
the
producer
and
often
when
birds
are
raised
in
quantities
they
are
sold
alive
and
dressed
by
the
butcher
however
poultry
that
is
to
be
shipped
long
distances
and
in
large
quantities
or
stored
for
long
periods
of
time
is
usually
prepared
at
a
slaughtering
place
this
process
of
slaughtering
and
shipping
requires
great
care
for
if
attention
is
not
given
to
details
the
poultry
will
be
in
a
state
of
deterioration
when
it
reaches
the
consumer
and
therefore
unfit
for
food
in
order
to
avoid
the
deterioration
of
poultry
that
is
slaughtered
some
distance
from
the
place
of
its
consumption
each
bird
is
well
fed
up
to
within
hours
before
it
is
killed
then
it
is
starved
so
that
its
alimentary
tract
will
be
as
empty
as
possible
at
the
time
of
killing
such
birds
are
killed
by
cutting
the
large
blood
vessel
running
up
to
the
head
when
properly
done
this
method
of
killing
allows
almost
all
the
blood
to
be
drained
from
the
body
and
the
keeping
qualities
are
much
improved
at
practically
the
same
time
the
brain
is
pierced
by
the
knife
thrust
and
as
soon
as
the
bleeding
commences
the
fowl
becomes
paralyzed
as
the
tissues
relax
the
feathers
may
be
pulled
easily
from
the
skin
without
immersing
the
bird
in
hot
water
this
method
of
plucking
known
as
is
preferable
when
the
skin
must
be
kept
intact
and
the
poultry
kept
for
any
length
of
time
the
head
and
feet
are
left
on
and
the
entrails
are
not
removed
the
poultry
is
then
chilled
to
the
freezing
point
but
not
below
it
after
which
the
birds
are
packed
ten
in
a
box
and
shipped
to
the
market
in
refrigerator
cars
or
placed
in
cold
storage
unless
the
poultry
is
to
be
cooked
immediately
after
slaughter
such
measures
are
absolutely
necessary
as
its
flesh
is
perishable
and
will
not
remain
in
good
condition
for
a
long
period
of
time
poultry
that
has
been
properly
raised
killed
transported
and
stored
is
very
likely
to
come
into
the
market
in
such
condition
that
it
can
not
be
readily
distinguished
from
freshly
killed
birds
when
exposed
to
warmer
temperatures
however
storage
poultry
spoils
much
more
quickly
than
does
fresh
poultry
for
this
reason
if
there
is
any
evidence
that
poultry
has
been
in
storage
it
should
be
cooked
as
soon
as
possible
after
purchase
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
poultry
that
which
is
kept
at
a
temperature
just
above
freezing
and
delivered
within
a
few
weeks
after
slaughtering
and
that
which
is
frozen
and
kept
in
storage
a
much
longer
time
when
properly
cared
for
either
one
is
preferable
to
freshly
killed
poultry
that
is
of
poor
quality
or
has
had
a
chance
to
spoil
poultry
that
has
been
frozen
must
be
thawed
carefully
it
should
be
first
placed
in
a
refrigerator
and
allowed
to
thaw
to
that
temperature
before
it
is
placed
in
a
warmer
one
it
should
never
be
thawed
by
putting
it
into
warm
water
thawing
it
in
this
way
really
helps
it
to
decompose
a
sure
indication
of
poultry
is
the
pinched
look
it
possesses
a
condition
brought
about
by
packing
the
birds
tightly
against
one
another
storage
poultry
usually
has
the
head
and
feet
left
on
and
its
entrails
are
not
removed
indeed
it
has
been
determined
by
experiment
that
poultry
will
keep
better
if
these
precautions
are
observed
the
removal
of
the
entrails
seems
to
affect
the
internal
cavity
of
the
bird
so
that
it
does
not
keep
well
and
as
a
matter
of
safety
it
should
be
cooked
quickly
after
this
has
been
done
in
the
home
selection
of
chicken
to
be
able
to
select
chicken
properly
the
housewife
must
be
familiar
with
the
terms
that
are
applied
to
chickens
to
designate
their
age
or
the
cookery
process
for
which
they
are
most
suitable
is
a
general
name
for
all
varieties
of
this
kind
of
poultry
but
in
its
specific
use
it
means
a
common
domestic
fowl
that
is
less
than
year
old
is
also
a
general
term
but
in
its
restricted
use
in
cookery
it
refers
to
the
domestic
hen
or
cock
over
year
of
age
as
distinguished
from
the
chicken
or
pullet
a
is
chicken
from
to
months
old
which
because
of
its
tenderness
is
suitable
for
broiling
a
is
at
least
months
old
and
a
is
between
months
and
year
old
with
these
terms
understood
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
if
fried
chicken
is
desired
a
fowl
would
not
be
a
wise
purchase
the
quality
of
the
bird
is
the
next
consideration
in
the
selection
of
chicken
a
number
of
things
have
a
bearing
on
the
quality
among
these
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
are
the
feeding
and
care
that
the
bird
has
received
during
its
growth
the
way
in
which
it
has
been
prepared
for
market
and
so
on
all
of
these
things
may
be
determined
by
careful
observation
before
making
a
purchase
however
if
the
bird
is
drawn
and
especially
if
the
head
and
feet
are
removed
there
is
less
chance
to
determine
these
things
accurately

general
marks
of
good
a
chicken
older
than
a
broiler
that
has
been
plucked
should
not
be
scrawny
nor
drawn
looking
like
that
shown
in
fig
nor
should
the
flesh
have
a
blue
tinge
that
shows
through
the
skin
rather
it
should
be
plump
and
well
rounded
like
the
one
shown
in
fig
there
should
be
a
sufficient
amount
of
fat
to
give
a
rich
yellow
color
it
should
be
plucked
clean
and
the
skin
should
be
clear
and
of
an
even
color
over
the
entire
bird
tender
easily
broken
skin
indicates
a
young
bird
tougher
skin
indicates
an
older
one
the
skin
should
be
whole
and
unbroken
likewise
when
pressed
with
the
fingers
it
should
be
neither
flabby
nor
stiff
but
pliable
illustration
fig
the
increase
of
age
in
a
chicken
is
to
some
extent
an
advantage
because
with
age
there
is
an
increase
in
flavor
thus
a
chicken
will
have
more
flavor
than
a
broiler
however
after
more
than
a
year
the
flavor
increases
to
such
an
extent
that
it
becomes
strong
and
disagreeable
with
the
advance
of
age
there
is
also
a
loss
of
tenderness
in
the
flesh
and
this
after
or
years
becomes
so
extreme
as
to
render
the
bird
almost
unfit
for
use
as
the
age
of
a
chicken
increases
the
proportion
of
flesh
to
bone
also
increases
up
to
the
complete
maturity
of
the
bird
hence
one
large
bird
is
a
more
economical
purchase
than
two
small
ones
that
equal
its
weight
because
the
proportion
of
bone
to
flesh
is
less
in
the
large
bird
than
in
the
small
ones
determining
the
age
of
an
excellent
way
in
which
to
determine
the
age
of
a
chicken
that
has
been
dressed
consists
in
feeling
of
the
breast
bone
at
the
point
where
it
protrudes
below
the
neck
in
a
very
young
chicken
a
broiler
for
instance
the
point
of
this
bone
will
feel
like
cartilage
which
is
firm
elastic
tissue
and
may
be
very
easily
bent
if
the
bird
is
about
a
year
old
the
bone
will
be
brittle
and
in
a
very
old
one
it
will
be
hard
and
will
not
bend
if
the
head
has
been
left
on
the
condition
of
the
beak
is
a
means
of
determining
age
in
a
young
chicken
it
will
be
smooth
and
unmarred
in
an
old
one
it
will
be
rough
and
probably
darker
in
color
if
the
feet
have
been
left
on
they
too
will
serve
to
indicate
the
age
the
feet
of
a
young
chicken
are
smooth
and
soft
whereas
those
of
an
old
bird
are
rough
hard
and
scaly
the
claws
of
a
young
one
are
short
and
sharp
but
as
the
bird
grows
older
they
grow
stronger
and
become
blunt
and
marred
with
use
the
spur
which
is
a
projection
just
above
the
foot
on
the
back
of
each
leg
is
small
in
the
young
chicken
and
increases
in
size
as
the
age
increases
however
the
spurs
are
more
pronounced
in
males
than
in
females
another
way
of
telling
the
age
of
dressed
chicken
is
to
observe
the
skin
after
plucking
young
birds
usually
have
some
pin
feathers
left
in
the
skin
are
small
unformed
feathers
that
do
not
pull
out
with
the
larger
ones
older
birds
are
usually
free
from
pin
feathers
but
have
occasional
long
hairs
remaining
in
the
skin
after
the
feathers
have
been
plucked
these
do
not
pull
out
readily
and
must
be
singed
off
when
the
chicken
is
being
prepared
for
cooking
determining
the
freshness
of
there
are
a
number
of
points
that
indicate
whether
or
not
a
chicken
is
fresh
in
a
freshly
killed
chicken
the
feet
will
be
soft
and
pliable
and
moist
to
the
touch
also
the
head
will
be
unshrunken
and
the
eyes
full
and
bright
the
flesh
of
such
a
chicken
will
give
a
little
when
pressed
but
no
part
of
the
flesh
should
be
softer
than
another
as
actual
decomposition
sets
in
the
skin
begins
to
discolor
the
first
marks
of
discoloration
occur
underneath
the
legs
and
wings
at
the
points
where
they
are
attached
to
the
body
any
dark
or
greenish
color
indicates
decomposition
as
does
also
any
slimy
feeling
of
the
skin
the
odor
given
off
by
the
chicken
is
also
an
indication
of
freshness
any
offensive
odor
of
course
means
that
the
flesh
has
become
unfit
for
food
live
occasionally
chickens
are
brought
to
the
market
and
sold
alive
this
means
of
course
that
the
birds
are
subjected
to
a
certain
amount
of
fright
and
needless
cruelty
and
that
the
work
of
slaughtering
falls
to
the
purchaser
the
cost
however
is
decreased
a
few
cents
on
the
pound
such
birds
must
be
chosen
first
of
all
by
weight
and
then
by
the
marks
that
indicate
age
which
have
already
been
given
selection
of
poultry
other
than
chicken
the
determination
of
quality
especially
freshness
is
much
the
same
for
other
kinds
of
poultry
as
it
is
for
chicken
in
fact
the
same
points
apply
in
most
cases
but
each
kind
seems
to
have
a
few
distinguishing
features
which
are
here
pointed
out
selection
of
turkeys
rank
next
to
chickens
in
popularity
as
food
they
are
native
to
america
and
are
perhaps
better
known
here
than
in
foreign
countries
turkey
is
a
much
more
seasonal
food
than
chicken
it
being
best
in
the
fall
turkey
that
has
been
killed
at
that
time
provided
it
is
properly
stored
and
cared
for
is
better
than
fresh
turkey
marketed
out
of
season
the
age
of
a
turkey
can
be
fairly
accurately
told
by
the
appearance
of
its
feet
very
young
turkeys
have
black
feet
and
as
they
mature
the
feet
gradually
grow
pink
so
that
at
more
than
year
old
the
feet
will
be
found
to
be
pink
however
as
the
bird
grows
still
older
the
color
again
changes
and
a
turkey
will
have
or
blackish
looking
feet
the
legs
too
serve
to
indicate
the
age
of
turkeys
those
of
a
young
turkey
are
smooth
but
as
the
birds
grow
older
they
gradually
become
rough
and
scaly
a
young
turkey
will
have
spurs
that
are
only
slightly
developed
whereas
an
old
turkey
will
have
long
sharp
ones
turkeys
are
seldom
marketed
when
they
are
very
young
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
this
is
occasionally
done
the
mature
birds
are
more
generally
marketed
turkeys
often
reach
a
large
size
weighing
as
much
as
to
pounds
a
mature
turkey
has
proportionately
a
larger
amount
of
flesh
and
a
smaller
amount
of
bone
than
chicken
hence
even
at
a
higher
price
per
pound
turkey
is
fully
as
economical
as
chicken
selection

they

the
flexibility
of

windpipe
is
an
excellent
test
for
the
age
of
ducks
in
the
young
bird
the
windpipe
may
be
easily
moved
whereas
in
the
old
one
it
is
stationary

quite
hard

meat
of
ducks
is
dark
over
the
entire
bird
and
the
greatest
amount
is
found
on
the
breast
its
flavor
is
quite
typical
and
differs
very
much
from
turkey
and
chicken
however
there
is
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
meat
even
on
a
duck
and
it
does
not
carve

very
good
advantage

this
fact
geese
are
generally
fattened
before
they
are
slaughtered
and
often
half

of
the

is
fat
the

enormous
proportions
and
are
considered
a
delicacy

this

will
serve
as
a
guide
in
selecting
poultry
that
is
to
be
used
as
food
composition
of
poultry
the
composition
of
poultry
is
very
similar
to
that
of
meats
in
fact
poultry
is
composed
of
protein
fat
water
mineral
salts
and
extractives
that
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
found
in
meats
the
protein
which
usually
varies
from
to
per
is
a
much
more
constant
factor
than
the
fat
which
varies
from
to
per
cent
this
variation
of
course
makes
the
total
food
value
high
in
some
kinds
of
poultry
and
low
in
others
for
instance
in
a
young
broiler
that
has
not
been
fattened
the
food
value
is
extremely
low
whereas
in
a
mature
bird
such
as
a
goose
which
increases
very
markedly
in
fatty
tissue
after
reaching
maturity
it
is
extremely
high
a
factor
that
detracts
considerably
from
the
edible
portion
of
poultry
is
the
waste
material
or
refuse
this
consists
of
the
bones
cartilage
head
feet
and
entrails
or
inedible
internal
organs
the
greater
the
proportion
of
such
waste
material
the
more
the
total
nutritive
value
of
the
flesh
is
reduced
it
is
claimed
that
birds
that
have
flesh
do
not
become
so
fat
as
those
which
have
dark
flesh
this
of
course
makes
their
nutritive
value
less
because
the
fat
of
poultry
is
what
serves
to
supply
a
large
part
of
the
nutrition
there
is
no
particular
difference
as
is
commonly
supposed
between
the
red
and
white
meat
of
poultry
the
difference
in
color
is
due
to
a
difference
in
the
blood
supply
but
this
does
not
affect
the
composition
to

preparation
of
chicken
as
has
been
implied
poultry
must
be
properly
prepared
before
it
is
ready
for
cooking
likewise
the
method
of
cookery
determines
how
it
must
be
prepared
for
example
if
it
is
to
be
roasted
it
must
be
drawn
if
it
is
to
be
stewed
it
must
be
drawn
and
cut
into
suitable
pieces
and
so

the
various
steps
that
must
be
taken
to
make

detail

as
has
been
shown
the
housewife
does
not
have
to
dress

chicken

she
is
to
cook

is
kill
and
pluck
it
there
may
be
times
when
she
will
be
called
on
to
perform
this
task
or
at
least
direct
it
a
common
way
of
killing
chicken
in
the
home
is
simply
to
grasp
it
firmly
by
the
legs
lay
it
on
a
block
and
then
chop
the
head
off
with
a
sharp
hatchet
or
a
cleaver
if
this
plan
is
followed
the
beheaded
chicken
must
be
held
firmly
until
the
blood
has
drained
away
and
the
reflex
action
that
sets
in
has
ceased
otherwise
there
is
danger
of
becoming
splashed
with
blood
after
a
chicken
has
been
killed
the
first
step
in
its
preparation
no
matter
how
it
is
to
be
cooked
consists
in
removing
the
feathers
or
it
as
this
operation
is
called
plucking
can
be
done
dry
by
simply
pulling
out
the
feathers
however
a
bird
can
be
plucked
more
readily
if
it
is
first
immersed
in
water
at
the
boiling
point
for
a
few
minutes
such
water
has
a
tendency
to
loosen
the
feathers
so
that
they
can
be
pulled
from
the
skin
easily
unless
the
chicken
is
to
be
used
at
once
though
dry
plucking
is
preferable
to
the
other
method
care
should
be
taken
not
to
tear
or
mar
the
skin
in
plucking
and
the
operation
is
best
performed
by
pulling
out
the
feathers
a
few
at
a
time
with
a
quick
jerk
in
a
young
chicken
small
feathers
commonly
called
pin
feathers
are
apt
to
remain
in
the
skin
after
plucking
these
may
be
pulled
out
by
pinching
each
with
the
point
of
a
knife
pressed
against
the
thumb
and
then
giving
a
quick
jerk

such

therefore
is
to

cut

they
are
cooked

the
process
known
as

often
resorted

will
be
readily
understood
consists
in
removing
the
flesh
from
the
bones
before

bird
is
cooked
boned
chicken
may
be
prepared
by
roasting
or
broiling
in

case
the
cookery
process
is
the

as
that
already
given
for
poultry
that
is
not
boned
if
it
is
to
be
roasted
the
cavity
that
results
from
the
removal
of
the
bones
and
internal
organs
should
be
filled
with
stuffing
or
forcemeat
so
that
the
bird
will
appear
as
if
nothing
had
been
removed
if
it
is

is
not
necessary
cooked
boned
chicken
may
be

either
hot
or

other
kinds
of
poultry
may
be
boned
if
desired
and
if
the
directions
here
given
for
boning
chicken
are
thoroughly
learned
no
difficulty
will
be
encountered
in
performing
this
operation
on
any
kind
boning
is
not
a
wasteful
process
as
might
be
supposed
because
after
the
flesh
is
removed
from
the
bones
they
may
be
used
in
the
making
of

the

of
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
giblets
that
is
the
liver
heart
and
gizzard
of
all
kinds
of
fowl
are
used
in
gravy
making
and
as
an
ingredient
for
stuffing
when
poultry
is
stewed
as
in
making
stewed
chicken
it
is
not
uncommon
to
cook
the
giblets
with
the
pieces
of
chicken
the
gizzard
and
heart
especially
require
long
slow
cooking
to
make
them
tender
enough
to
be
eaten
therefore
when
poultry
is
broiled
fried
or
roasted
some
other
cookery
method
must
be
resorted
to
as
these
processes
are
too
rigid
for
the
preparation
of
giblets
in
such
cases
the
best
plan
is
to
cook
them
in
water
until
they
are
tender
and
then
sauté
them
in
butter
when
cooked
in
this
way
they
may
be
served
with
the
poultry
for
to
many
persons
they
are
very
palatable
dishes
from
poultry
poultry
of
any
kind
is
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
but
even
if
this
were
not
so
there
are
so
many
practical
ways
in
which
such
may
be
used
to
advantage
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
extravagance
not
to
utilize
them
the
bones
that
remain
from
roast
fowl
after
carving
are
especially
good
for
soup
making
as
they
will
yield
quite
a
quantity
of
flavor
when
they
are
thoroughly
cooked
if
sufficient
meat
remains
on
the
carcass
to
permit
of
slicing
such
meat
may
be
served
cold
however
if
merely
small
pieces
are
left
or
if
fried
or
broiled
poultry
remains
it
will
be
advisable
to
make
some
other
use
of
these
it
is
often
possible
for
the
ingenious
housewife
to
add
other
foods
to
them
so
as
to
increase
the
quantity
and
thus
make
them
serve
more
for
example
a
small
quantity
of
pork
or

may
be

used

as

common

however
it
is
sufficiently
common
to
warrant
a
few
directions
concerning
its
use
game
can
be
purchased
or
caught
only
during
certain
seasons
designated
by
the
laws
of
various
states
such
laws
are
quite
stringent
and
have
been
made
for
the
protection
of
each
particular
species
the
meat
of
wild
animals
and
birds
is
usually
strong
in
flavor
just
why
this
is
so
however
is
not
definitely
known
undoubtedly
some
of
the
strong
flavor
is
due
to
the
particular
food
on
which
the
animal
or
the
bird
feeds
and
much
of
this
flavor
is
due
to
extractives
contained
in
the
flesh
when
game
birds
and
animals
have
considerable
fat
surrounding
the
tissues
the
greater
part
of
it
is
often
rejected
because
of
its
extremely
high
flavor
by
proper
cooking
however
much
of
this
flavor
if
it
happens
to
be
a
disagreeable
one
can
be
driven
off
the
general
composition
of
the
flesh
of
various
kinds
of
game
does
not
differ
greatly
from
that
of
similar
domestic
animals
or
birds
for
instance
the
flesh
of
bear
is
similar
in
its
composition
to
that
of
fat
beef
as
bear
is
one
of
the
wild
animals
that
is
very
fat
venison
or
the
meat
obtained
from
deer
contains
much
less
fat
and
its
composition
resembles
closely
that
of
very
lean
beef
rabbits
and
most
of
the
wild
birds
are
quite
lean
in
fact
they
are
so
lean
that
it
is
necessary
in
the
preparation
of
them
to
supply
sufficient
fat
to
make

more
appetizing
recipes
for
game
only
a
few
recipes
for
the
preparation
of
game
are
here
given
because
in
the
case
of
wild
birds
the
cookery
methods
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
given
for
poultry
and
in
the
case
of
such
animals
as
bears
the
directions
for
preparing
steaks
and
other
cuts
are
identical
with
the
cooking
of
similar
cuts
of
beef
rabbit
and
squirrel
are
perhaps
the
most
common
game

method
that
is
to

fish
fish
in
the
diet
fish
provides
another
class
of
or
food
as
this
term
is
generally
understood
it
includes
both
vertebrate
fish
that
is
fish
having
a
backbone
such
as
salmon
cod
shad
and
many
other
water
animals
such
as
lobsters
crabs
shrimp
oysters
and
clams
a
distinction
however
is
generally
made
between
these
two
groups
those
having
bones
being
regarded
properly
as
and
those
partly
or
entirely
encased
in
shells
as
it
is
according
to
this
distinction
that
this
class
of
foods
is
considered
in
this
section
because
all
the
varieties
of
both
fish
and
shell
fish
are
in
many
respects
similar
the
term
is
often
applied
to
them
but
as
a
rule
this
term
is
restricted
to
designate
products
as
distinguished
from
fish
fish
can
usually
be
purchased
at
a
lower
price
than
meat
and
for
this
reason
possesses
an
economic
advantage
over
it
besides
the
price
the
substitution
of
fish
for
meat
makes
for
economy
in
a
number
of
ways
to
which
consideration
is
not
usually
given
these
will
become
clearly
evident
when
it
is
remembered
that
nearly
all
land
animals
that
furnish
meat
live
on
many
agricultural
products
that
might
be
used
for
human
food
then
too
other
foods
fed
to
animals
although
not
actually
human
foods
require
in
their
raising
the
use
of
soil
that
might
otherwise
be
utilized
for
the
raising
of
food
for
human
beings
this
is
not
true
in
the
case
of
fish
they
consume
the
vegetation
that
grows
in
lakes
streams
and
the
ocean
as
well
as
various
kinds
of
insects
small
fish
which
can
not
be
used
as
human
food
and
which
do
not
require
the
use
of
the
soil
in
addition
much
of
the
food
that
animals
which
are
take
into
their
bodies
is
required
to
maintain
a
constant
temperature
above
that
of
their
surroundings
so
that
not
all
of
what
they
eat
is
used
in
building
up
the
tissues
of
their
bodies
with
fish
however
it
is
different
as
they
are
and
actually
receive
heat
from
their
surroundings
they
do
not
require
food
for
bodily
warmth
practically
all
that
they
take
into
the
body
is
built
up
into
a
supply
of
flesh
that
may
be
used
as
food
for
human
beings
with
fish
as
with
other
foods
some
varieties
are
sought
more
than
others
the
popularity
of
certain
kinds
depending
on
the
individual
taste
or
the
preference
of
the
people
in
a
particular
locality
such
popularity
however
is
often
a
disadvantage
to
the
purchaser
because
a
large
demand
for
certain
varieties
has
a
tendency
to
cause
a
rise
in
price
the
increased
price
does
not
indicate
that
the
fish
is
of
more
value
to
the
consumer
than
some
other
fish
that
may
be
cheaper
because
it
is
less
popular
although
quite
as
valuable
from
a
food
standpoint
the
preference
for
particular
kinds
of
fish
and
the
persistent
disregard
of
others
that
are
edible
is
for
the
most
part
due
to
prejudice
in
certain
localities
one
kind
of
fish
may
be
extremely
popular
while
in
others
the
same
fish
may
not
be
used
for
food
at
all
such
prejudice
should
be
overcome
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
practically
every
fish
taken
from
pure
water
is
fit
to
eat
in
the
sense
that
it
furnishes
food
and
is
not
injurious
to
health
in
addition
any
edible
fish
should
be
eaten
in
the
locality
where
it
is
caught
the
transportation
of
this
food
is
a
rather
difficult
matter
and
besides
it
adds
to
the
cost
it
is
therefore
an
excellent
plan
to
make
use
of
the
kind
of
fish
that
is
most
plentiful
as
such
practice
will
insure
both
better
quality
and
a
lower
market
price
as
is
well
known
fish
is
an
extremely
perishable
food
therefore
when
it
is
caught
in
quantities
too
great
to
be
used
at
one
time
it
is
preserved
in
various
ways
the
preservation
methods
that
have
proved
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
are
canning
salting
and
drying
smoking
and
preserving
in
various
kinds
of
brine
and
pickle
as
such
methods
are
usually
carried
out
in
the
locality
where
the
fish
is
caught
many
varieties
of
fish
can
be
conveniently
stored
for
long
periods
of
time
and
so
distributed
as
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
consumer
this
plan
enables
persons
far
removed
from
the
source
of
supply
to
procure
fish
frequently
composition
and
food
value
of
fish
composition
of
fish
comparison
of
fish
with
in
general
the
composition
of
fish
is
similar
to
that
of
meat
for
both
of
them
are
foods
however
some
varieties
of
fish
contain
large
quantities
of
fat
and
others
contain
very
little
of
this
substance
so
the
food
value
of
the
different
kinds
varies
greatly
as
in
the
case
of
meat
fish
is
lacking
in
carbohydrate
because
of
the
close
similarity
between
these
two
foods
fish
is
a
very
desirable
substitute
for
meat
in
fact
fish
is
in
some
respects
a
better
food
than
meat
but
it
can
not
be
used
so
continuously
as
meat
without
becoming
monotonous
that
is
to
say
a
person
will
grow
tired
of
fish
much
more
quickly
than
of
most
meats
the
similarity
between
the
composition
of
fish
and
that
of
meat
has
much
to
do
with
regulating
the
price
of
these
protein
foods
which
as
has
already
been
learned
are
the
highest
priced
foods
on
the
market
protein
in
in
fish
as
well
as
in
shell
fish
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
food
substances
present
is
protein
this
proportion
varies
with
the
quantity
of
water
bone
and
refuse
that
the
particular
food
contains
and
with
the
physical
structure
of
the
food
in
fresh
fish
the
percentage
of
this
material
varies
from
to
per
cent
the
structure
of
fish
is
very
similar
to
that
of
meat
as
the
flesh
is
composed
of
tiny
hollow
fibers
containing
extractives
in
which
are
dissolved
mineral
salts
and
various
other
materials
the
quantity
of
extractives
found
in
these
foods
however
is
less
than
that
found
in
meat
fish
extracts
of
any
kind
such
as
clam
juice
oyster
juice
are
similar
in
their
composition
to
any
of
the
extractives
of
meat
differing
only
in
the
kind
and
proportions
in
addition
to
the
muscle
fibers
of
fish
which
are
of
course
composed
of
protein
fish
contains
a
small
quantity
of
albumin
just
as
meat
does
it
is
the
protein
material
in
fish
as
well
as
in
shell
fish
that
is
responsible
for
its
very
rapid
decomposition
the
application
of
heat
has
the
same
effect
on
the
protein
of
fish
as
it
has
on
that
of
meat
fowl
and
other
animal
tissues
consequently
the
same
principles
of
cookery
apply
to
both
the
retention
and
the
extraction
of
flavor
fat
in
the
percentage
of
fat
in
fish
varies
from
less
than
per
cent
in
some
cases
to
a
trifle
more
than
per
cent
in
others
but
this
high
percentage
is
rare
as
the
average
fish
probably
does
not
exceed
from
to
or
per
cent
of
fat
this
variation
affects
the
total
food
value
proportionately
the
varieties
of
fish
that
contain
the
most
fat
deteriorate
most
rapidly
and
withstand
transportation
the
least
well
so
that
when
these
are
secured
in
large
quantities
they
are
usually
canned
or
preserved
in
some
manner
fish
containing
a
large
amount
of
fat
such
as
salmon
turbot
eel
herring
halibut
mackerel
mullet
butterfish
and
lake
trout
have
a
more
moist
quality
than
those
which
are
without
fat
such
as
cod
therefore
as
it
is
difficult
to
cook
fish
that
is
lacking
in
fat
and
keep
it
from
becoming
dry
a
fat
fish
makes
a
more
palatable
food
than
a
lean
fish
the
fat
of
fish
is
very
strongly
flavored
consequently
any
that
cooks
out
of
fish
in
its
preparation
is
not
suitable
for
use
in
the
cooking
of
other
foods
carbohydrate
in
like
meat
fish
does
not
contain
carbohydrate
in
any
appreciable
quantity
in
fact
the
small
amount
that
is
found
in
the
tissue
and
that
compares
to
the
glycogen
found
in
animal
tissues
is
not
present
in
sufficient
quantities
to
merit
consideration
mineral
matter
in
in
fish
mineral
matter
is
quite
as
prevalent
as
in
meat
through
a
notion
that
fish
contains
large
proportions
of
phosphorus
and
because
this
mineral
is
also
present
in
the
brain
the
idea
that
fish
is
a
brain
food
has
become
widespread
it
has
been
determined
however
that
this
belief
has
no
foundation
food
value
of
fish
factors
determining
food
the
total
food
value
of
fish
as
has
been
shown
is
high
or
low
varying
with
the
food
substances
it
contains
therefore
since
weight
for
weight
the
food
value
of
fat
is
much
higher
than
that
of
protein
it
follows
that
the
fish
containing
the
most
fat
has
the
highest
food
value
fat
and
protein
as
is
well
known
do
not
serve
the
same
function
in
the
body
but
each
has
its
purpose
and
is
valuable
and
necessary
in
the
diet
some
varieties
of
fish
contain
fat
that
is
strong
in
flavor
and
from
these
the
fat
should
be
removed
before
cooking
especially
if
the
flavor
is
disagreeable
this
procedure
of
course
reduces
the
total
food
value
of
the
fish
but
it
should
be
done
if
it
increases
the
palatability
relative
nutritive
value
of
fish
and
when
fish
and
meat
are
compared
it
will
be
observed
that
some
kinds
of
fish
have
a
higher
food
value
than
meat
particularly
if
the
fish
contains
much
fat
and
the
meat
is
lean
when
the
average
of
each
of
these
foods
is
compared
however
meat
will
be
found
to
have
a
higher
food
value
than
fish
to
show
how
fish
compares
with
meat
and
fowl
the
composition

of

of

a

will

that
on
the
whole
the
percentage
of
protein
in
the
various
kinds
of
fish
is
as
much
as
that
in
meat
while
in
a
few
instances
it
is
greater
this
proves
that
so
far
as
the
quantity
of
protein
is
concerned
these
two
foods
are
equally
valuable
in
their
and
qualities
it
will
be
seen
also
that
the
percentage
of
fat
in
fish
varies
greatly
some
varieties
containing
more

but
most
of
them
containing
less
furthermore
the
total
food
value
per
pound
in
calories
is
for
the
most

greater
in

than

whereas
the
food

per

due

protein
is
equivalent
in
most
cases
but
higher
in
some
of
the
fish
than
in
the
meat
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
drying
or
preserving
of
fish
does
not
in
any
way
decrease
its
food
value
in
fact
pound
for
pound
dried
fish
both
smoked

salt
contains
more
nutritive
value
than
fresh
fish
because
the
water
which
decreases
the
food
value
of
fresh
fish
is
driven
off
in
drying
however
when
prepared
for
eating
dried
fish
in
all
probability
has
more
food
value
than
fresh
fish
because
water
or
moisture
of
some
sort
must
be
supplied
in
its
preparation
the
method
of
preparing
dried
or
preserved
fish
as
well
as
fresh
fish
has
much
to
do
with
the
food
value
obtained
from
it
just
as
nutritive
value
is
lost
in
the
cooking
of
meat
by
certain
methods
so
it
may
be
lost
in
the
preparation
of
fish
if
the
proper
methods
are
not
applied
to
obtain
as
much
food
value
from
fish
as
possible
the
various
points
that
are
involved
in
its
cookery
must
be
thoroughly
understood
certain
facts
concerning
the
buying
of
fish
must
also
be
kept
in
mind
for
instance
in
canned
fish
almost
all
the
bones
skin
and
other
inedible
parts
except
the
tails
heads
and
fins
of
very
small
fish
have
been
removed
before
packing
indicating
that
practically
all
the
material
purchased
is
edible
in
the
case
of
fresh
fish
a
large
percentage
of
what
is
bought
must
be
wasted
in
preparation
and
in
eating
the
percentage
of
waste
varying
from
to
per
cent
digestibility
of
the
food
value
of
any
food
is
an
important
item
when
its
usefulness
as
a
food
is
taken
into
account
but
of
equal
importance
is
the
manner
in
which
the
body
uses
the
food
that
is
whether
it
digests
the
food
with
ease
or
with
difficulty
therefore
when
the
value
of
fish
as
a
food
is
to
be
determined
its
digestibility
must
receive
definite
consideration
as
has
already
been
explained
much
depends
on
the
cooking
of
the
food
in
question
on
the
whole
fish
is
found
to
be
more
easily
digested
than
meat
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
a
few
kinds
or
certain
cuts
that
physicians
recognize
this
characteristic
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
fish
is
often
used
in
the
feeding
of
invalids
or
sick
people
when
meat
is
not
permitted
the
ease
with
which
fish
is
digested
is
influenced
largely
by
the
quantity
of
fat
it
contains
for
this
fat
acting
in
identically
the
same
way
as
the
fat
of
meat
has
the
effect
of
slowing
the
digestion
that
is
carried
on
in
the
stomach
it
follows
then
that
with
possibly
one
or
two
exceptions
the
kinds
of
fish
most
easily
digested
are
those
which
are
lean
in
addition
to
the
correct
cooking
of
fish
and
the
presence
of
fat
a
factor
that
largely
influences
the
digestibility
of
this
food
is
the
length
of
the
fibers
of
the
flesh
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
parts
of
an
animal
having
long
fibers
are
tougher
and
less
easily
digested
than
those
having
short
fibers
this
applies
with
equal
force
in
the
case
of
fish
its
truth
is
evident
when
it
is
known
that
cod
a
lean
fish
is
digested
with
greater
difficulty
than
some
of
the
fat
fish
because
of
the
length
and
toughness
of
its
fibers
this
however
is
comparative
and
it
must
not
be
thought
that
fish
on
the
whole
is
digested
with
difficulty
another
factor
that
influences
the
digestibility
of
fish
is
the
salting
of
it
whether
fish
is
salted
dry
or
in
brine
the
salt
hardens
the
fibers
and
tissues
while
the
salt
acts
as
a
preservative
in
causing
this
hardening
it
at
the
same
time
makes
the
fish
preserved
in
this
manner
a
little
more
difficult
to
digest
this
slight
difference
need
scarcely
be
considered
so
far
as
the
normal
adult
is
concerned
but
in
case
of
children
or
persons
whose
digestion
is
not
entirely
normal
its
effect
is
likely
to
be
felt

another
point
to
be
considered
in
the
purchase
of
fish
is
the
size
some
fish
such
as
halibut
and
salmon
are
so
large
that
they
must
usually
be
cut
into
slices
or
steaks
to
permit
the
housewife
to
purchase
the
quantity
she
requires
for
immediate
use
other
fish
are
of
such
size
that
one
is
sufficient
for
a
meal
and
others
are
so
small
that
several
must
be
purchased
to
meet
the
requirements
an
idea
or
the
difference
in
the
size
of
fish
can
be
gained
from
figs
and
the
larger
fish
in
fig
is
a
whitefish
and
the
smaller
one
is
a
smelt
fish
about
the
size
of
smelts
lend
themselves
readily
to
frying
and
sautéing
whereas
the
larger
kinds
like
whitefish
may
be
prepared
to
better
advantage
by
baking
either
with
or
without
suitable
stuffing
the
larger
fish
in
fig
is
a
carp
and
the
smaller
one
is
a
pike
much
use
is
made
of
pike
but
carp
has
been
more
shunned
than
sought
after
however
when
carp
is
properly
cooked
it
is
a
very
palatable
food
and
besides
it
possesses
high
food
value
illustration
fig
in
the
purchase
of
fish
the
housewife
provided
she
is
not
obliged
to
have
fish
for
a
particular
day
will
do
well
also
to
get
away
from
the
purchasing
of
fish
that
is
if
she
is
not
obliged
to
serve
fish
on
friday
she
should
endeavor
to
serve
it
on
some
other
day
even
twice
a
week
is
not
too
often
if
such
a
plan
were
followed
out
fishermen
would
be
able
to
market
their
catch
when
it
is
procured
and
the
waste
of
fish
or
the
necessity
for
keeping
it
until
a
particular
day
would
be
overcome
another
way
in
which
the
housewife
can
help
herself
in
the
selection
of
fish
is
to
become
familiar
with
all
the
varieties
of
edible
fish
caught
in
or
near
her
community
when
she
has
done
this
it
will
be
a
splendid
plan
for
her
to
give
those
with
which
she
is
unfamiliar
a
trial
she
will
be
surprised
at
the
many
excellent
varieties
that
are
obtained
in
her
locality
and
consequently
come
to
her
fresher
than
fish
that
has
to
be
shipped
long
distances
freshness
of
in
the
purchase
of
fish
the
housewife
should
not
permit
herself
to
be
influenced
by
any
prejudice
she
may
have
as
to
the
name
or
the
appearance
of
the
fish
however
too
much
attention
can
not
be
paid
to
its
freshness
several
tests
can
be
applied
to
fish
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
fresh
therefore
when
a
housewife
is
in
doubt
she
should
make
an
effort
to
apply
them
fish
should
not
give
off
any
offensive
odor
the
eyes
should
be
bright
and
clear
not
dull
nor
sunken
the
gills
should
have
a
color
and
there
should
be
no
blubber
showing
the
flesh
should
be
so
firm
that
no
dent
will
be
made
when
it
is
touched
with
the
finger
fish
may
also
be
tested
for
freshness
by
placing
it
in
a
pan
of
water
if
it
sinks
it
may
be
known
to
be
fresh
but
if
it
floats
it
is
not
fit
for
use
care
of
fish
in
the
if
fish
is
purchased
in
good
condition
and
every
effort
should
be
made
to
see
that
it
is
the
responsibility
of
its
care
in
the
home
until
it
is
presented
to
the
family
as
a
cooked
dish
rests
on
the
housewife
if
upon
reaching
the
housewife
it
has
not
been
cleaned
it
should
be
cleaned
at
once
in
case
it
has
been
cleaned
either
by
the
fish
dealer
or
the
housewife
and
can
not
be
cooked
at
once
it
should
be
looked
over
carefully
immediately
washed
in
cold
water
salted
slightly
inside
and
out
placed
in
a
covered
enamel
or
porcelain
dish
and
then
put
where
it
will
keep
as
cold
as
possible
if
a
refrigerator
is
used

fish
should
be
put
in
the
compartment
from
which
odors
can
not
be
carried
to
foods
in
the
other
compartments
in
cold
weather
an
excellent
plan
is
to
put
the
fish
out
of
doors
instead
of
in
the
refrigerator
for
there
it
will
remain
sufficiently
cold
without
the
use
of
ice
however
the
best
and
safest
way
is
to
cook
the
fish
at
once
so
that
storing
it
for
any
length
of
time
after
its
delivery
will
not
be
necessary
salt
and
smoked
fish
do
not
of
course
require
the
same
care
as
fresh
fish
however
as
many
of
these
varieties
are
strong
in
flavor
it
is
well
to
weaken
their
flavor
before
cooking
them

soaking

used
for
various

and
numerous
other

the
effect
of
these
different
methods
is
exactly
the
same
on
fish
as
on
meat
since
the
two
foods
are
the
same
in
general
construction
the
cookery
method
to
select
depends
largely
on
the
size
kind
quality
and
flavor
of
the
fish
just
as
an
old
chicken
with
muscles
is
not
suitable
for
broiling
so
a
very
large
fish
should
not
be
broiled
unless
it
can
be
cut
into
slices

or
thin
pieces
cook

to

when

a

more

as
many

less

this
they
are
somewhat
dry

are
improved
considerably
by
the
addition

then
too
some

very
few

steaming
is
practically
the

produces
a
dish
similar
to

fish
the
only
difference
is
that
steamed
fish
is
suspended
over
the
water
and
is
cooked
by
the
steam
that
rises
instead
of
being
cooked
directly
in
the
water

the
fish
is
not
surrounded
by
water
it
does
not
lose
its
nutriment

sear
them
quickly
over

hot
fire

then
cook
them
more
slowly

are
done
turning
frequently
to
prevent
burning
as
most
fish
and
particularly
the
small
ones
used
for
broiling
contain
almost
no
fat
it
is
necessary
to
supply
fat
for
successful
broiling
and
improvement
of
flavor
it
is
difficult
to
add
fat
to
the
fish
while
it
is
broiling
so
as
a
rule
the
fat
is
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
fish
after
it
has
been
removed
from
the
broiler
the
fat
may
consist
of
broiled
strips

it
always
involves
the
freshening

this
consists

are
so
salty

require
considerable
soaking

usually
advisable

change

several
times

it

this

simple

matter
as

case
of

because

is
one
of
the
foods
that
are
not
popular
as

still
fish
can
be
used
if
a
little
thought
is
given
to
the
matter

the
popularity

mentioned
depends
largely
on
whether
they
can

easily
obtained
and
whether

taste
as
they
are
found
in

their
greatest
use
is
among
people
living
near

but
they

of

lobsters

they
are
used
more
often
to
provide
a

to

something
more

several
precautions
should
be
observed
in
purchasing
shell
fish
for
instance
crabs
and
lobsters
should
be
purchased
alive
they
are
usually
shipped
on
ice
so
that
they
will
remain
in
this
condition
for
some
time
and
they
are
displayed
on
ice
in
the
markets
for
the
same
reason
such
shell
fish
should
be
kept
alive
until
they
are
plunged
into
boiling
water
to
cook
oysters
and
clams
bought
in
the
shell
must
also
be
alive
when
purchased
a
tightly
closed
shell
indicates
that
they
are
alive
whereas
a
slightly
open
shell
proves
that
they
are
dead
if
these
two
varieties
are
bought
out
of
the
shells
the
fish
themselves
should
not
be
accompanied
by
a
great
quantity
of
liquid
considerable
liquid
is
an
indication
that
the
oysters
or
clams
have
been
adulterated
by
the
addition
of
water
formerly
it
was
the
custom
to
keep
oysters
in
fresh
water
as
the
water
they
absorb
bloats
or
fattens
them
this
practice
however
has
fallen
into
disfavor
shell
fish
lend
themselves
admirably
to
a
large
variety
of
dishes
including
soups
entrees
salads
and
substitutes
for
meat
dishes
they
possess
a
great
deal
of
distinctive
flavor
their
food
value
is
comparatively
high
and
provided
they
are
in
good
condition
and
are
properly
prepared
they
are
healthful
and
easily
digested
it
can
therefore
be
seen
that
shell
fish
have
much
to
recommend
their
use
there
is
considerable
danger
however
in
using
any
varieties
that
are
not
perfectly
fresh
or
freshly
cooked
in
the
case
of
mollusks
or
bivalves
much
harm
has
resulted
from
the
use
of
those
which
have
been
grown
or
bred
in
unsanitary
surroundings
because
of
these
facts
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
great

be
exercised

the
varieties

most

milk
a
pint
of
milk
has
a
value
of
calories
while
the

quantity
of

has
an
approximate
value
of
only
calories
because
of
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
these
two
foods
oysters
costing
several
times
as
much
as
milk
the
use
of
oysters
is
not
so
cheap
a
way
of
supplying
food
material
digestibility
of
when
merely
the
ability
of
the
digestive
tract
to
handle
oysters
is
taken
into
consideration
they
are
said
to
be
easily
digested
if
they
are
served
raw
or
are
properly
prepared
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
when
taken
as
a
food
they
are
disposed
of
in
a
comparatively
short
time
by
the
stomach
in
addition
their
absorption
from
the
alimentary
tract
is
quite
complete
that
is
they
contain
little
or
no
waste
material
but
just
as
cooking
has
much
to
do
with
the
digestibility
of
other
protein
foods
so
it
has
with
oysters
for
this
reason
the
housewife
who
wishes
to
feed
her
family
this
food
in
its
most
digestible
form
must
thoroughly
understand
all
phases
of
its
cooking
healthfulness
of
much
illness
has
been
attributed
to
oysters
and
without
doubt
they
have
been
the
cause
of
some
typhoid
and
some
ptomaine
poisoning
a
knowledge
of
the
reason
for
these
diseases
has
done
much
to
eliminate
them
it
is
now
definitely
known
that
much
of
the
typhoid
caused
from
eating
oysters
was
due
to
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
grown
in
their
growth
oysters
fasten
themselves
to
stationary
things
such
as
rocks
or
piles
driven
into
the
ground
underneath
the
water
and
they
obtain
their
food
by
simply
opening
the
shell
and
making
use
of
minute
particles
of
plant
and
animal
life
that
they
are
able
to
extract
from
the
water
when
the
water
was
not
clean
or
when
sewage
was
turned
into
it
typhoid
germs
were
transmitted
to
persons
who
took
oysters
as
food
at
present
there
is
scarcely
any
danger
from
such
causes
for
more
care
is
now
given
to
the
conditions
under
which
oysters
grow
ptomaine
poisoning
from
oysters
was
caused
by
eating
them
when
they
had
been
improperly
cared
for
in
storage
or
had
been
taken
from
the
shells
after
they
were
dead
unless
persons
handling
oysters
know
how
to
take
care
of
them
this
danger
is
still
likely
to
exist
purchasing
to
be
able
to
purchase
oysters
intelligently
the
housewife
should
be
familiar
with
the
names
of
the
various
kinds
these
names
are
dependent
on
the
locality
from
which
the
oysters
come
and
include
points
cape
cods
cotuits
lynn
and
numerous
other
varieties
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
varieties
raised
in
different
localities
are
quite
distinctive
differing
to
some
extent
in
both
size
and
appearance
unless
the
purchaser
is
familiar
with
the
different
varieties
almost
any
of
the
small
oysters
are
likely
to
be
sold
to
her
for
one
of
the
small
varieties
and
likewise
any
of
the
large
oysters
for
one
of
the
large
varieties
while
this
is
of
small
consequence
provided
the
quality
is
satisfactory
and
the
price
is
right
it
is
well
for
every
housewife
to
familiarize
herself
with
the
names
of
the
various
kinds
so
that
she
may
know
just
what
variety
she
is
purchasing
when
oysters
are
bought
in
the
shell
they
should
be
alive
a
fact
that
can
be
determined
by
the
tightly
closed
shell
as
has
already
been
stated
if
the
shells
are
not
closed
or
can
be
easily
pried
apart
it
may
be
known
that
the
oysters
are
not
good
and
that
they
should
be
rejected
when
it
is
possible
to
procure
them
oysters
that
have
been
removed
from
the
shells
immediately
after
being
taken
from
the
beds
are
preferable
to
those
which
have
not
been
removed
from
the
shells
before
shipping
when
purchased
out
of
the
shells
oysters
should
be
grayish
in
color
should
have
no
disagreeable
odor
and
should
contain
no
excess
water
or
liquid
after
being
purchased
oysters
should
be
kept
on
ice
unless
they
can
be
cooked
at
once
the
season
for
oysters
is
from
september
to
april
inclusive
while
in
some
localities
they
can
be
purchased
at
other
times
during
the
year
they
are
not
likely
to
be
so
good
in
fact
it
is
not
safe
to
use
oysters
during
the
warm
months
important
points
in
cooking
the
protein
of
oysters
like
that
found
in
other
foods
is
coagulated
by
heat
long
heat
provided
it
is
sufficiently
intense
makes
oysters
tough
and
in
this
condition
they
are
neither
agreeable
to
eat
nor
readily
digested
when
they
are
to
be
cooked
at
a
high
temperature
therefore
the
cooking
should
be
done
quickly
if
they
are
to
be
cooked
at
a
temperature
below
the
boiling
point
they
may
be
subjected
to
heat
for
a
longer
time
without
becoming
so
tough
as
when
a
high
temperature
is
used
cooking
quickly
at
a
high
temperature
however
is
preferable
in
most
cases
to
long
slow
cooking
for
example
in
the
preparation
of
oyster
stew
long
cooking
produces
no
better
flavor
than
short
cooking
at
a
high
temperature
and
renders
oysters
far
less
digestible

unless

are

it
becomes
necessary
to
open
them
in
the
home
before
they
can
be
served
raw
or
cooked
to
open
oysters
is
not
difficult
and
with
a
little
experience
the
work
can
be
done
with
ease
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
the
two
shells
of
an
oyster
which
are
called
are
held
together
by
a
single
muscle
known
as
the
that
lies
near
the
center
and
that
this
muscle
must
be
cut
before
the
shell
will
open
readily
before
attempting
to
open
oysters
however
they
should
be
scrubbed
with
clean
water
so
as
to
remove
any
sand
that
may
be
on
the
shells
when
the
oysters
are
cleaned
proceed
to
open
them
in
the
manner
shown
in
figs
and
first
as
in
fig
insert
the
point
of
a
knife
into
the
hinged
or
pointed
end
and
push
the
blade
between
the
valves
until
they
appear
to
separate
when
it
will
be
known
that
the
muscle
has
been
cut
then
as
in
fig
lay
the
valves
open
and
loosen
the
oyster
from
the
shell
by
slipping
the
knife
under
it
if
the
oysters
that
are
being
opened
are
to
be
cooked
before
serving
simply
drop
them
with
their
liquid
into
a
suitable
vessel
and
discard
the
shells
before
using
the
oysters
remove
them
from
the
liquid
look
them
over
carefully
to
see
that
no
small
particles
of
shells
cling
to
them
and
wash
them
in
clean
cold
water
to
remove
any
sand
that
may
be
present
also
strain
the
liquid
through
a
cloth
so
that
it
will
be
free
from
sand
when
used
in
the
preparation
of
the
dish
for
which
the
oysters
are
to
be
used
or
for
the
making
of
soup
or
broth
oysters
that
are
to
be

raw
are
frequently
served
on
the
half

therefore
if
they

clams
and
their
preparation
nature

digestibility
of
clams
are
bivalves
similar
to
oysters
in
both
form
and
composition
because
of
the
similarity
in
composition
they
are
utilized
in
much
the
same
ways
as
oysters
being
used
extensively
for
food
in
parts
of
the
country
where
the
supply
is
large
there
are
numerous
varieties
of
clams
and
some
of
them
differ
slightly
from
each
other
in
appearance
color
and
flavor
preference
for
the
different
varieties
is
largely
a
matter
of
individual
taste

may
be
purchased
loose
or
in
the
shell
and
they
may
be
served
in

out
of
the
shell
however
when
bought
in
the
shell
they
must
be
purchased
alive
and
must
be
subjected
to
the
same
tests
as
are
oysters
as
in
the
case
of
oysters
they
may
be
eaten
raw
or
cooked
their
preparation
for
cooking
is
similar
to
that
of
oysters

the
raw
state
they
are
easily
digested

upon
the
application
of
heat
they
become
tough
and
the
longer
they
are

the
tougher
they
become

can
therefore
be
seen
that
the
digestibility
of
clams
is
influenced
very
much
by
cooking

scalloped
dishes
get
their
name
from
the
fact
that
scallop
shells
were
originally
used
for
their
preparation
not
all
of
the
scallop
is
used
for
food
merely
the
heavy
muscle
that
holds
the
two
shells
together
is
edible
scallops
are
slightly
higher
in
protein
than
oysters
and
clams
and
they
also
have
a
higher
food
value
than
these
two
mollusks
the
most
common
method
of
preparation
for
scallops
is
to
fry
them
but
they
may
also
be
baked

general
characteristics
the

fish
lobsters
crabs
and
shrimp
come
under
the
head
of
crustaceans
that
is
animals
consisting
of
jointed
sections
each
of
which
is
covered
with
a
hard
shell
their
flesh
is
similar
in
composition
to
that
of
other
fish
but
it
is
tougher
and
harder
to
digest
however
it
is
popular
because
of
its
unique
and
delicate
flavor
in
fact
whenever
these
varieties
of
fish
can
be
obtained
along
the
seacoast
or
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
place
where
they
are
caught
they
are
considered
a
delicacy
if
they
can
be
shipped
alive
to
any
point
they
are
perfectly
safe
to
use
although
quite
high
in
price
because
of
their
perishable
nature
unless
such
shell
fish
can
be
procured
alive
in
the
markets
the
use
of
a
good
brand
of
any
of
them
canned
is
recommended
in
fact
canned
lobster
crab
and
shrimp
are
very
satisfactory
and
may
be
substituted
for
any
of
the
fresh
cooked
varieties
in
the
recipes
that
follow
it
is
true
that
some
persons
object
to
canned
food
because
ptomaine
poisoning
sometimes
results
but
it
has
been
found
that
ptomaine
poisoning
is
more
liable
to
result
from
eating
these
foods
when
they
are
bought
in
the
market
in
poor
condition
than
when
they
are
secured
in
canned
form
care
must
be
exercised
however
whenever
use
is
made
of
canned
food
of
any
kind
upon
opening
a
can
of
any
of
these
varieties
of
fish
the
entire
contents
should
be
removed
from
the
can
at
once
and
used
as
soon
as
possible
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
ptomaine
poisoning
that
is
sometimes
caused
by
eating
canned
foods
is
not
due
to
the
fact
that
the
foods
come
in
tin
cans
but
that
they
are
allowed
to
stand
in
the
cans
after
they
are
opened
upon
their
being
exposed
to
the
air
putrefaction
sets
in
and
causes
the
harmful
effect
lobsters
crabs
and
shrimp
are

total
food
value
than
the
others
if
they
are
not
prepared

an
indigestible
way
they
are
comparatively
easy
to

it
has
been
proved
a
fallacy
that
lobster
and
ice

are
a
dangerous
combination

they
are
very
small
and
as
a
rule
are
not
found
in
large
numbers
preliminary
before
either
or
crabs
can
be
used
as
food
a
certain
amount
of
preparation
is
necessary
in
the
case
of
crabs
plunge
them
alive
into
hot
water
allow
them
to
come
to
the
boiling
point
and
cook
slowly
for
hour
it
is
a
good
plan
to
add
tablespoonful
of
salt
for
each
crab
that
is
being
boiled
while
the
crabs
are
cooking
remove
the
scum
that
rises
to
the
top
when
they
are
sufficiently
cooked
open
the
shells
and
take
out
the
meat
being
careful
to
remove
all
the
meat
from
the
claws
crabs
require
a
somewhat
different
kind
of
preparation
with
this
variety
lift
up
the
points
on
each
side
of
the
back
shell
and
remove
the
spongy
substance
that
is
found
under
them
in
addition
take
off
the
apron
which
is
the
small
piece
that
occurs
at
the
lower
part
of
the
shell
and
that
terminates
in
points
the
crabs
are
then
ready
for
frying
which
is
the
method
of
cooking
that
is
usually
applied
to
this
variety
crab
meat
is
used
for
cocktails
in
the
same
way
as
oysters
clams
and
lobster
in
fact
no
better
appetizer
to
serve
at
the
beginning
of
a
meal
can
be
found
to
make
cocktail
remove
the
meat
from
the
shells
of
cooked
crabs
in
the
way
just
explained
and
chill
it
then
place
it
in
stemmed
glasses
and
serve

deviled
variety
in
the
cooking
of
crabs
can
be
secured
by
deviling
them
according
to
the
accompanying
directions
as
will
be
observed
this
is
done
in
practically
the

shrimp
and
their
preparation
nature
of
shrimp
are
similar
to
crabs
and
lobsters
in
composition
and
in
the
methods
of
preparation
they
differ
considerably
in
appearance
however
and
are
smaller
in
size
when
alive
shrimp
are
a
mottled
greenish
color
but
upon
being
dropped
into
water
they
turn
red
when
they
have
cooked
sufficiently
the
meat
which
is
very
delicious
may
be
easily
removed
from
the
shells
after
the
meat
of
shrimp
is
thus
prepared
it
may
be
used
cold
in
a
salad
or
a
cocktail
or
it
may
be
utilized
in
a
number
of
ways
for
hot
dishes
very
often
a
chafing
dish
is
used
in
the
preparation
of
such
dishes
but
this
utensil
is
not
necessary
as
they
may
be
cooked
in
an
ordinary
utensil
on
a
stove
of
any
kind
