footnote
a
paper
read
at
the
society
of
telegraph
engineers
and
electricians
on
the
november
by
willoughby
smith
in
my
presidential
address
which
i
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
before
this
society
at
our
first
meeting
this
year
i
called
attention
somewhat
hurriedly
to
the
results
of
a
few
of
my
experiments
on
induction
and
at
the
same
time
expressed
a
hope
that
at
a
future
date
i
might
be
able
to
bring
them
more
prominently
before
you
that
date
has
now
arrived
and
my
endeavor
this
evening
will
be
to
demonstrate
to
you
by
actual
experiment
some
of
what
i
consider
the
most
important
results
obtained
my
desire
is
that
all
present
should
see
these
results
and
with
that
view
i
will
try
when
practicable
to
use
a
mirror
reflecting
galvanometer
instead
of
a
telephone
all
who
have
been
accustomed
to
the
use
of
reflecting
galvanometers
will
readily
understand
the
difficulty
on
account
of
its
delicacy
of
doing
so
where
no
special
arrangements
are
provided
for
its
use
but
perhaps
with
a
little
indulgence
on
your
part
and
patience
on
mine
the
experiments
may
be
brought
to
a
successful
issue
illustration
induction
reliable
records
extending
over
hundreds
of
years
show
clearly
with
what
energy
and
perseverance
scientific
men
in
every
civilized
part
of
the
world
have
endeavored
to
wrest
from
nature
the
secret
of
what
is
termed
her
phenomena
of
magnetism
and
as
is
invariably
the
case
under
similar
circumstances
the
results
of
the
experiments
and
reasoning
of
some
have
far
surpassed
those
of
others
in
advancing
our
knowledge
for
instance
the
experimental
philosophers
in
many
branches
of
science
were
groping
as
it
were
in
darkness
until
the
brilliant
light
of
genius
illumined
their
path
although
perhaps
i
should
not
be
justified
in
comparing
oersted
with
newton
yet
he
also
discovered
what
are
termed
new
laws
of
nature
in
a
manner
at
once
precise
profound
and
amazing
and
which
opened
a
new
field
of
research
to
many
of
the
most
distinguished
philosophers
of
that
time
who
were
soon
engaged
in
experimenting
in
the
same
direction
and
from
whose
investigations
arose
a
new
science
which
was
called
oersted
demonstrated
from
inductive
reasoning
that
every
conductor
of
electricity
possessed
all
the
known
properties
of
a
magnet
while
a
current
of
electricity
was
passing
through
it
if
you
earnestly
contemplate
the
important
adjuncts
to
applied
science
which
have
sprung
from
that
apparently
simple
fact
you
will
not
fail
to
see
the
importance
of
the
discovery
for
it
was
while
working
in
this
new
field
of
that
sturgeon
made
the
first
and
faraday
many
of
his
discoveries
relating
to
induction
soon
after
the
discovery
by
oersted
just
referred
to
faraday
with
the
care
and
ability
manifest
in
all
his
experiments
showed
that
when
an
intermittent
current
of
electricity
is
passing
along
a
wire
it
induces
a
current
in
any
wire
forming
a
complete
circuit
and
placed
parallel
to
it
and
that
if
the
two
wires
were
made
into
two
helices
and
placed
parallel
to
each
other
the
effect
was
more
marked
this
faraday
designated
induction
and
it
is
with
this
kind
of
induction
i
wish
to
engage
your
attention
this
evening
for
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
presents
some
of
the
most
interesting
and
important
facts
in
electrical
science
here
are
two
flat
spirals
of
copper
wire
suspended
separately
fashion
in
wooden
frames
marked
respectively
a
and
b
the
one
marked
a
is
so
connected
that
reversals
at
any
desired
speed
per
minute
from
a
battery
of
one
or
more
cells
can
be
passed
through
it
the
one
marked
b
is
so
connected
to
the
galvanometer
and
a
reverser
as
to
show
the
deflection
caused
by
the
induced
currents
which
are
momentary
in
duration
and
in
the
galvanometer
circuit
all
on
the
same
side
of
zero
for
as
the
battery
current
on
making
contact
produces
an
induced
current
in
the
reverse
direction
to
itself
but
in
the
same
direction
on
breaking
the
contact
of
course
the
one
would
neutralize
the
other
and
the
galvanometer
would
not
be
affected
the
galvanometer
connections
are
therefore
reversed
with
each
reversal
of
the
battery
current
and
by
that
means
the
induced
currents
are
as
you
perceive
all
in
the
same
direction
and
produce
a
steady
deflection
the
connections
are
as
shown
on
the
sheet
before
you
marked
which
i
think
requires
no
further
explanation
before
proceeding
please
to
bear
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
inductive
effects
vary
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
between
the
two
spirals
when
parallel
to
each
other
and
that
the
induced
current
in
b
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
reversals
of
the
battery
current
passing
through
spiral
a
and
also
to
the
strength
of
the
current
so
passing
faraday
fertile
imagination
would
naturally
suggest
the
question
is
this
lateral
action
which
we
call
magnetism
extended
to
a
distance
by
the
action
of
intermediate
particles
if
so
then
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
all
substances
would
not
be
affected
in
the
same
way
and
therefore
different
results
would
be
obtained
if
different
media
were
interposed
between
the
inductor
and
what
i
will
merely
call
for
distinction
the
inductometer
with
a
view
to
proving
this
experimentally
faraday
constructed
three
flat
helices
and
placed
them
parallel
to
each
other
a
convenient
distance
apart
the
middle
helix
was
so
arranged
that
a
voltaic
current
could
be
sent
through
it
at
pleasure
a
differential
galvanometer
was
connected
with
the
other
helices
in
such
a
manner
that
when
a
voltaic
current
was
sent
through
the
middle
helix
its
inductive
action
on
the
lateral
helices
should
cause
currents
in
them
having
contrary
directions
in
the
coils
of
the
galvanometer
this
was
a
very
prettily
arranged
electric
balance
and
by
placing
plates
of
different
substances
between
the
inductor
and
one
of
the
inductometers
faraday
expected
to
see
the
balance
destroyed
to
an
extent
which
would
be
indicated
by
the
deflection
of
the
needle
of
the
galvanometer
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
it
made
not
the
least
difference
whether
the
intervening
space
was
occupied
by
such
insulating
bodies
as
air
sulphur
and
shellac
or
such
conducting
bodies
as
copper
and
the
other
metals
these
results
however
did
not
satisfy
him
as
he
was
convinced
that
the
interposition
of
the
metals
especially
of
copper
did
have
an
effect
but
that
his
apparatus
was
not
suitable
for
making
it
visible
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
so
sound
a
reasoner
and
so
careful
an
experimenter
had
not
the
great
advantage
of
the
assistance
of
such
suitable
instruments
for
this
class
of
research
as
the
and
the
telephone
but
although
he
could
not
practically
demonstrate
the
effects
which
by
him
could
be
so
clearly
seen
it
redounds
to
his
credit
that
as
the
improvement
in
instruments
for
this
kind
of
research
has
advanced
the
results
he
sought
for
have
been
found
in
the
direction
in
which
he
predicted
a
and
b
will
now
be
placed
a
definite
distance
apart
and
comparatively
slow
reversals
from
ten
leclanch√©
cells
sent
through
spiral
a
you
will
observe
the
amount
of
the
induced
current
in
b
as
shown
on
the
scale
of
the
galvanometer
in
circuit
with
that
spiral
now
midway
between
the
two
spirals
will
be
placed
a
plate
of
iron
as
shown
in
plate
and
at
once
you
observe
the
deflection
of
the
galvanometer
is
reduced
by
less
than
one
half
showing
clearly
that
the
presence
of
the
iron
plate
is
in
some
way
influencing
the
previous
effects
the
iron
will
now
be
removed
but
the
spirals
left
in
the
same
position
as
before
and
by
increasing
the
speed
of
the
reversals
you
see
a
higher
deflection
is
given
on
the
galvanometer
now
on
again
interposing
the
iron
plate
the
deflection
falls
to
a
little
less
than
as
before
i
wish
this
fact
to
be
carefully
noted
the
experiment
will
be
repeated
with
a
plate
of
copper
of
precisely
the
same
dimensions
as
the
iron
plate
and
you
observe
that
although
the
conditions
are
exactly
alike
in
both
cases
the
interposition
of
the
copper
plate
has
apparently
no
effect
at
the
present
speed
of
the
reversals
although
the
interposition
of
the
iron
plate
under
the
same
conditions
reduced
the
deflection
about
fifty
per
cent
we
will
now
remove
the
copper
plate
as
we
did
the
iron
one
and
increase
the
speed
of
the
reversals
to
the
same
as
in
the
experiment
with
the
iron
and
you
observe
the
deflection
on
the
galvanometer
is
about
the
same
as
it
was
on
that
occasion
now
by
replacing
the
copper
plate
to
its
former
position
you
will
note
how
rapidly
the
deflection
falls
we
will
now
repeat
the
experiment
with
a
plate
of
lead
you
will
see
that
like
the
copper
it
is
unaffected
at
the
low
speed
but
there
the
resemblance
ceases
for
at
the
high
speed
it
has
but
very
slight
effect
thus
these
metals
iron
copper
and
lead
appear
to
differ
as
widely
in
their
electrical
as
they
do
in
their
mechanical
properties
of
course
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
accurate
measurements
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
but
careful
and
reliable
measurements
have
been
made
the
results
of
which
are
shown
on
the
sheet
before
you
marked
it
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
these
results
that
the
percentage
of
inductive
energy
intercepted
does
not
increase
for
different
speeds
of
the
reverser
in
the
same
rate
with
different
metals
the
increase
with
iron
being
very
slight
while
with
tin
it
is
comparatively
enormous
it
was
observed
that
time
was
an
important
element
to
be
taken
into
account
while
testing
the
above
metals
that
is
to
say
the
lines
of
force
took
an
appreciable
time
to
polarize
the
particles
of
the
metal
placed
in
their
path
but
having
accomplished
this
they
passed
more
freely
through
it
now
let
us
go
more
minutely
into
the
subject
by
the
aid
of
plate
figs
and
in
fig
let
a
and
b
represent
two
flat
spirals
spiral
a
being
connected
to
a
battery
with
a
key
in
circuit
and
spiral
b
connected
to
a
galvanometer
then
on
closing
the
battery
circuit
an
instantaneous
current
is
induced
in
spiral
b
if
a
metal
plate
half
an
inch
thick
be
placed
midway
between
the
spirals
and
the
experiment
repeated
it
will
be
found
that
the
induced
current
received
by
b
is
the
same
in
amount
as
in
the
first
case
this
does
not
prove
as
would
at
first
appear
that
the
metal
plate
fails
to
intercept
the
inductive
radiant
energy
and
it
can
scarcely
be
so
for
if
the
plate
is
replaced
by
a
coil
of
wire
it
is
found
that
induced
currents
are
set
up
therein
and
therefore
inductive
radiant
energy
must
have
been
intercepted
this
apparent
contradiction
may
be
explained
as
follows
in
fig
let
d
represent
a
source
of
heat
a
vessel
of
boiling
water
for
instance
and
e
a
sensitive
thermometer
receiving
and
measuring
the
radiant
heat
now
if
for
instance
a
plate
of
vulcanite
is
interposed
it
cuts
off
and
absorbs
a
part
of
the
radiant
heat
emitted
by
d
and
thus
a
fall
is
produced
in
the
thermometer
reading
but
the
vulcanite
soon
becoming
heated
by
the
radiant
heat
cut
off
and
absorbed
by
itself
radiates
that
heat
and
causes
the
thermometer
reading
to
return
to
about
its
original
amount
the
false
impression
is
thus
produced
that
the
original
radiated
heat
was
unaffected
by
the
vulcanite
plate
instead
of
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
vulcanite
plate
had
cut
off
the
radiant
heat
becoming
heated
itself
by
so
doing
and
was
consequently
then
the
radiating
body
affecting
the
thermometer
the
effect
is
similar
in
the
case
of
induction
between
the
two
spirals
spiral
a
induces
and
spiral
b
receives
the
induced
effect
the
metal
plate
being
then
interposed
cuts
off
and
absorbs
either
all
or
part
of
the
inductive
radiant
energy
emitted
by
a
the
inductive
radiant
energy
thus
cut
off
however
is
not
lost
but
is
converted
into
electrical
energy
in
the
metal
plate
thereby
causing
it
to
become
as
in
the
case
of
the
vulcanite
in
the
heat
experiment
a
source
of
radiation
which
compensates
as
far
as
spiral
b
is
concerned
for
the
original
inductive
radiant
energy
cut
off
the
only
material
difference
noticeable
in
the
two
experiments
is
that
in
the
case
of
heat
the
time
that
elapses
between
the
momentary
fall
in
the
thermometer
reading
due
to
the
interception
by
the
vulcanite
plate
of
the
radiant
beat
and
the
subsequent
rise
due
to
the
interposing
plate
itself
radiating
that
heat
is
long
enough
to
render
the
effect
clearly
manifest
whereas
in
the
case
of
induction
the
time
that
elapses
is
so
exceedingly
short
that
unless
special
precautions
are
taken
the
radiant
energy
emitted
by
the
metal
plate
is
liable
to
be
mistaken
for
the
primary
energy
emitted
by
the
inducing
spiral
the
current
induced
in
the
receiving
spiral
by
the
inducing
one
is
practically
instantaneous
but
on
the
interposition
of
a
metal
plate
the
induced
current
which
as
before
described
is
set
up
by
the
plate
itself
has
a
perceptible
duration
depending
upon
the
nature
and
mass
of
metal
thus
interposed
copper
and
zinc
produce
in
this
manner
an
induced
current
of
greater
length
than
metals
of
lower
conductivity
with
the
exception
of
iron
which
gives
an
induced
current
of
extremely
short
duration
it
will
therefore
be
seen
that
in
endeavoring
to
ascertain
what
i
term
the
specific
inductive
resistance
of
different
metals
by
the
means
described
notice
must
be
taken
of
and
allowance
made
for
two
points
first
that
the
metal
plate
not
only
cuts
off
but
itself
radiates
and
secondly
that
the
duration
of
the
induced
currents
radiated
by
the
plates
varies
with
each
different
metal
under
experiment
this
explains
the
fact
before
pointed
out
that
the
apparent
percentage
of
inductive
radiant
energy
intercepted
by
metal
plates
varies
with
the
speed
of
the
reversals
for
in
the
case
of
copper
the
induced
current
set
up
by
such
a
plate
has
so
long
a
duration
that
if
the
speed
of
the
reverser
is
at
all
rapid
the
induced
current
has
not
time
to
exhaust
itself
before
the
galvanometer
is
reversed
and
thus
the
current
being
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
galvanometer
tends
to
produce
a
lower
deflection
if
the
speed
of
the
reverser
be
further
increased
the
greater
part
of
the
induced
current
is
received
on
the
opposite
terminal
of
the
galvanometer
so
that
a
negative
result
is
obtained
we
know
that
it
was
the
strong
analogies
which
exist
between
electricity
and
magnetism
that
led
experimentalists
to
seek
for
proofs
that
would
identify
them
as
one
and
the
same
thing
and
it
was
the
result
of
professor
oersted
experiment
to
which
i
have
already
referred
that
first
identified
them
probably
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
it
will
be
possible
to
demonstrate
clearly
that
heat
and
electricity
are
as
closely
allied
then
knowing
the
great
analogies
existing
between
heat
and
light
may
we
not
find
that
heat
light
and
electricity
are
modifications
of
the
same
force
or
property
susceptible
under
varying
conditions
of
producing
the
phenomena
now
designated
by
those
terms
for
instance
friction
will
first
produce
electricity
then
heat
and
lastly
light
as
is
well
known
heat
and
light
are
reflected
by
metals
i
was
therefore
anxious
to
learn
whether
electricity
could
be
reflected
in
the
same
way
in
order
to
ascertain
this
spiral
b
was
placed
in
this
position
which
you
will
observe
is
parallel
to
the
lines
of
force
emitted
by
spiral
a
in
this
position
no
induced
current
is
set
up
therein
so
the
galvanometer
is
not
affected
but
when
this
plate
of
metal
is
placed
at
this
angle
it
intercepts
the
lines
of
force
which
cause
it
to
radiate
and
the
secondary
lines
of
force
are
intercepted
and
converted
into
induced
currents
by
spiral
b
to
the
power
indicated
by
the
galvanometer
thus
the
phenomenon
of
reflection
appears
to
be
produced
in
a
somewhat
similar
manner
to
reflection
of
heat
and
light
the
whole
arrangement
of
this
experiment
is
as
shown
on
the
sheet
before
you
numbered
which
i
need
not
i
think
more
fully
explain
to
you
than
by
saying
that
the
secondary
lines
of
force
are
represented
by
the
dotted
lines
supported
in
this
wooden
frame
marked
c
is
a
spiral
similar
in
construction
to
the
one
marked
b
but
in
this
case
the
copper
wire
is
inch
in
diameter
and
consists
of
turns
with
a
total
length
of
yards
its
resistance
is
ohms
the
whole
is
inclosed
between
two
thick
sheets
of
card
paper
the
two
ends
of
the
spiral
are
attached
to
two
terminals
placed
one
on
either
side
of
the
frame
a
wire
from
one
of
the
terminals
is
connected
to
one
pole
of
a
battery
of
leclanche
cells
the
other
pole
being
connected
with
one
terminal
of
a
reverser
the
second
terminal
of
which
is
connected
to
the
other
terminal
of
the
spiral
now
if
this
very
small
spiral
which
is
in
circuit
with
the
galvanometer
and
a
reverser
be
placed
parallel
to
the
center
of
spiral
c
a
very
large
deflection
will
be
seen
on
the
galvanometer
scale
this
will
gradually
diminish
as
the
smaller
spiral
is
passed
slowly
over
the
face
of
the
larger
until
on
nearing
the
edge
of
the
latter
the
smaller
spiral
will
cease
to
be
affected
by
the
inductive
lines
of
force
from
spiral
c
and
consequently
the
galvanometer
indicates
no
deflection
but
if
this
smaller
spiral
be
placed
at
a
different
angle
to
the
larger
one
it
is
as
you
observe
by
the
deflection
of
the
galvanometer
again
affected
this
experiment
is
analogous
to
the
one
illustrated
by
diagram
which
represents
the
result
of
an
experiment
made
to
ascertain
the
relative
strength
of
capability
or
producing
inductive
effects
of
different
parts
of
a
straight
a
fig
represents
the
iron
core
pp
the
primary
coil
connected
at
pleasure
to
one
grove
cell
b
by
means
of
the
key
k
s
a
small
secondary
coil
free
to
move
along
the
primary
coil
while
in
circuit
with
the
galvanometer
the
relative
strength
of
any
particular
spot
can
be
obtained
by
moving
the
coil
s
exactly
over
the
required
position
the
small
secondary
coil
is
only
cut
at
right
angles
when
it
is
placed
in
the
center
of
the
magnet
and
as
it
is
moved
toward
either
pole
so
the
lines
of
force
cut
it
more
and
more
obliquely
from
this
it
would
appear
that
the
results
obtained
are
not
purely
dependent
upon
the
strength
of
the
portion
of
the
magnet
over
which
the
secondary
coil
is
placed
but
principally
upon
the
angle
at
which
the
lines
of
force
cut
the
coil
so
placed
it
does
not
follow
therefore
that
the
center
of
the
magnet
is
its
strongest
part
as
the
results
of
the
experiments
at
first
sight
appear
to
show
it
was
while
engaged
on
those
experiments
that
i
discovered
that
a
telephone
was
affected
when
not
in
any
way
connected
with
the
spiral
but
simply
placed
so
that
the
lines
of
force
proceeding
from
the
spiral
impinged
upon
the
iron
diaphragm
of
the
telephone
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
force
emitted
from
the
spiral
is
such
that
starting
from
any
point
on
one
of
its
faces
a
circle
is
described
extending
to
a
similar
point
on
the
opposite
side
the
diameter
of
the
circles
described
decreases
from
infinity
as
the
points
from
which
they
start
recede
from
the
center
toward
the
circumference
from
points
near
the
circumference
these
circles
or
curves
are
very
small
to
illustrate
this
to
you
the
reverser
now
in
circuit
with
spiral
c
will
be
replaced
by
a
simple
make
and
break
arrangement
consisting
on
a
small
fixed
between
the
prongs
of
a
and
so
connected
that
influences
the
arms
of
the
fork
causing
them
to
vibrate
to
a
certain
pitch
the
apparatus
is
placed
in
a
distant
room
to
prevent
the
sound
being
heard
here
as
i
wish
to
make
it
inductively
audible
to
you
for
that
purpose
i
have
here
a
light
spiral
which
is
in
circuit
with
this
telephone
now
by
placing
the
spiral
in
front
of
spiral
c
the
telephone
reproduces
the
sound
given
out
by
the
so
loudly
that
i
have
no
doubt
all
of
you
can
hear
it
here
is
another
spiral
similar
in
every
respect
to
spiral
this
is
in
circuit
with
a
battery
and
an
ordinary
mechanical
make
and
break
arrangement
the
sound
given
off
by
which
i
will
now
make
audible
to
you
in
the
same
way
that
i
did
the
sound
of
the
now
you
hear
it
i
will
change
from
the
one
spiral
to
the
other
several
times
as
i
want
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
sounds
of
both
so
that
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
them
the
one
from
the
other
there
are
suspended
in
this
room
bodies
which
enable
us
by
their
rays
or
lines
of
force
to
see
the
bodies
with
which
we
are
surrounded
there
are
also
radiating
in
all
directions
from
me
while
speaking
lines
of
force
or
sound
waves
which
affect
more
or
less
each
one
of
you
but
there
are
also
in
addition
to
and
quite
independent
of
the
lines
of
force
just
mentioned
magnetic
lines
of
force
which
are
too
subtle
to
be
recognized
by
human
beings
consequently
figuratively
we
are
both
blind
and
deaf
to
them
however
they
can
be
made
manifest
either
by
their
notion
on
a
suspended
magnet
or
on
a
conducting
body
moving
across
them
the
former
showing
its
results
by
attraction
and
repulsion
the
latter
by
the
production
of
an
electric
current
for
instance
by
connecting
the
small
flat
spiral
of
copper
wire
in
direct
circuit
with
the
galvanometer
you
will
perceive
that
the
slightest
movement
of
the
spiral
generates
a
current
of
sufficient
strength
to
very
sensibly
affect
the
galvanometer
and
as
you
observe
the
amplitude
of
the
deflection
depends
upon
the
speed
and
direction
in
which
the
spiral
is
moved
we
know
that
by
moving
a
conductor
of
electricity
in
a
magnetic
field
we
are
able
to
produce
an
electric
current
of
sufficient
intensity
to
produce
light
resembling
in
all
its
phases
that
of
solar
light
but
to
produce
these
strong
currents
very
powerful
artificial
magnetic
fields
have
to
be
generated
and
the
conductor
has
to
be
moved
therein
at
a
great
expenditure
of
heat
energy
may
not
the
time
arrive
when
we
shall
no
longer
require
these
artificial
and
costly
means
but
have
learned
how
to
adopt
those
forces
of
nature
which
we
now
so
much
neglect
one
ampere
of
current
passing
through
an
ordinary
incandescent
lamp
will
produce
a
light
equal
to
ten
candles
and
i
have
shown
that
by
simply
moving
this
small
flat
spiral
a
current
is
induced
in
it
from
the
earth
magnetic
field
equal
to
ampere
with
these
facts
before
us
surely
it
would
not
be
boldness
to
predict
that
a
time
may
arrive
when
the
energy
of
the
wind
or
tide
will
be
employed
to
produce
from
the
magnetic
lines
of
force
given
out
by
the
earth
magnetism
electrical
currents
far
surpassing
anything
we
have
yet
seen
or
of
which
we
have
heard
therefore
let
us
not
despise
the
smallness
of
the
force
but
rather
consider
it
an
element
of
power
from
which
might
arise
conditions
far
higher
in
degree
and
which
we
might
not
recognize
as
the
same
as
this
developed
in
its
incipient
stage
if
the
galvanometer
be
replaced
by
a
telephone
no
matter
how
the
spiral
be
moved
no
sound
will
be
heard
simply
because
the
induced
currents
produced
consist
of
comparatively
slow
undulations
and
not
of
sharp
variations
suitable
for
a
telephone
but
by
placing
in
circuit
this
mechanical
make
and
break
arrangement
the
interruptions
of
the
current
are
at
once
audible
and
by
regulating
the
movement
of
the
spiral
i
can
send
signals
which
if
they
had
been
prearranged
might
have
enabled
us
to
communicate
intelligence
to
each
other
by
means
of
the
magnetism
i
show
this
experiment
more
with
a
view
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
for
experiments
on
induction
both
instruments
are
necessary
as
each
makes
manifest
those
currents
adapted
to
itself
the
lines
of
force
of
light
heat
and
sound
can
be
artificially
produced
and
intensified
and
the
more
intense
they
are
the
more
we
perceive
their
effects
on
our
eyes
ears
or
bodies
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
for
it
matters
not
how
much
their
power
is
increased
they
appear
in
no
way
to
affect
us
their
presence
can
however
be
made
manifest
to
our
eyes
or
ears
by
mechanical
appliances
i
have
already
shown
you
how
this
can
be
done
by
means
of
either
a
galvanometer
or
a
telephone
in
circuit
with
a
spiral
wire
i
have
already
stated
that
while
engaged
in
these
experiments
i
found
that
as
far
as
the
telephone
was
concerned
it
was
immaterial
whether
it
was
in
circuit
with
a
spiral
or
not
as
in
either
case
it
accurately
reproduced
the
same
sounds
therefore
much
in
the
same
way
as
lenses
assist
the
sight
or
tubes
the
hearing
so
does
the
telephone
make
manifest
the
lines
of
intermittent
inductive
energy
this
was
quite
a
new
phenomenon
to
me
and
on
further
investigation
of
the
subject
i
found
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
even
a
telephone
for
by
simply
holding
a
piece
of
iron
to
my
ear
and
placing
it
close
to
the
center
of
the
spiral
i
could
distinctly
hear
the
same
sounds
as
with
the
telephone
although
not
so
loud
the
intensity
of
the
sound
was
greatly
increased
when
the
iron
was
placed
in
a
magnetic
field
here
is
a
small
disk
of
iron
similar
to
those
used
in
telephones
firmly
secured
in
this
brass
frame
this
is
a
small
permanent
bar
magnet
the
marked
end
of
which
is
fixed
very
closely
to
but
not
touching
the
center
of
the
iron
disk
now
by
applying
the
disk
to
my
ear
i
can
hear
the
same
sounds
that
were
audible
to
all
of
you
when
the
telephone
in
circuit
with
a
small
spiral
was
placed
in
front
of
and
close
to
the
large
spiral
to
me
the
sound
is
quite
as
loud
as
when
you
heard
it
but
now
you
are
one
and
all
totally
deaf
to
it
my
original
object
in
constructing
two
large
spirals
was
to
ascertain
whether
the
inductive
lines
of
force
given
out
from
one
source
would
in
any
way
interfere
with
those
proceeding
from
another
source
by
the
aid
of
this
simple
iron
disk
and
magnet
it
can
be
ascertained
that
they
do
in
no
way
interfere
with
each
other
therefore
the
direction
of
the
lines
proceeding
from
each
spiral
can
be
distinctly
traced
for
when
the
two
spirals
are
placed
parallel
to
each
other
at
a
distance
of
apart
and
connected
to
independent
batteries
and
transmitters
as
shown
in
plate
each
transmitter
having
a
sound
perfectly
distinct
from
that
of
the
other
when
the
circuits
are
completed
the
separate
sounds
given
out
by
the
two
transmitters
can
be
distinctly
heard
at
the
same
time
by
the
aid
of
a
telephone
but
by
placing
the
telephone
in
a
position
neutral
to
one
of
the
spirals
then
only
the
sound
proceeding
from
the
other
can
be
heard
these
results
occur
in
whatever
position
the
spirals
are
placed
relatively
to
each
other
thus
proving
that
there
is
no
interference
with
or
blending
of
the
separate
lines
of
force
the
whole
arrangement
will
be
left
in
working
order
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
for
any
gentlemen
present
to
verify
my
statements
or
to
make
what
experiments
they
please
in
conclusion
i
would
ask
what
can
we
as
practical
men
gather
from
these
experiments
a
great
deal
has
been
written
and
said
as
to
the
best
means
to
secure
conductors
carrying
currents
of
very
low
tension
such
as
telephone
circuits
from
being
influenced
by
induction
from
conductors
in
their
immediate
vicinity
employed
in
carrying
currents
of
comparatively
very
high
tension
such
as
the
ordinary
telegraph
wires
covering
the
insulated
wires
with
one
or
other
of
the
various
metals
has
not
only
been
suggested
but
said
to
have
been
actually
employed
with
marked
success
now
it
will
found
that
a
thin
sheet
of
any
known
metal
will
in
no
appreciable
way
interrupt
the
inductive
lines
of
force
passing
between
two
flat
spirals
that
being
so
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
inductive
effects
are
influenced
by
a
metal
covering
as
described
telegraph
engineers
and
electricians
have
done
much
toward
accomplishing
the
successful
working
of
our
present
railway
system
but
still
there
is
much
scope
for
improvements
in
the
signaling
arrangements
in
foggy
weather
the
system
now
adopted
is
comparatively
useless
and
resource
has
to
be
had
at
such
times
to
the
dangerous
and
somewhat
clumsy
method
of
signaling
by
means
of
detonating
charges
placed
upon
the
rails
now
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
volta
induction
might
be
employed
with
advantage
in
various
ways
for
signaling
purposes
for
example
one
or
more
wire
spirals
could
be
fixed
between
the
rails
at
any
convenient
distance
from
the
signaling
station
so
that
when
necessary
intermittent
currents
could
be
sent
through
the
spirals
and
another
spiral
could
be
fixed
beneath
the
engine
or
guard
van
and
connected
to
one
or
more
telephones
placed
near
those
in
charge
of
the
train
then
as
the
train
passed
over
the
fixed
spiral
the
sound
given
out
by
the
transmitter
would
be
loudly
reproduced
by
the
telephone
and
indicate
by
its
character
the
signal
intended
one
of
my
experiments
in
this
direction
will
perhaps
better
illustrate
my
meaning
the
large
spiral
was
connected
in
circuit
with
twelve
leclanche
cells
and
the
two
make
and
break
transmitters
before
described
they
were
so
connected
that
either
transmitter
could
be
switched
into
circuit
when
required
and
this
i
considered
the
signaling
station
this
small
spiral
was
so
arranged
that
it
passed
in
front
of
the
large
one
at
the
distance
of
in
and
at
a
speed
of
miles
per
hour
the
terminals
of
the
small
spiral
were
connected
to
a
telephone
fixed
in
a
distant
room
the
result
being
that
the
sound
reproduced
from
either
transmitter
could
be
clearly
heard
and
recognized
every
time
the
spirals
passed
each
other
with
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
i
think
it
will
be
readily
understood
now
a
cheap
and
efficient
adjunct
to
the
present
system
of
railway
signaling
could
be
obtained
by
such
means
as
i
have
ventured
to
bring
to
your
notice
this
evening
thus
have
i
given
you
some
of
the
thoughts
and
experiments
which
have
occupied
my
attention
during
my
leisure
i
have
been
long
under
the
impression
that
there
is
a
feeling
in
the
minds
of
many
that
we
are
already
in
a
position
to
give
an
answer
to
almost
every
question
relating
to
electricity
or
magnetism
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
more
i
endeavor
to
advance
in
a
knowledge
of
these
subjects
the
more
am
i
convinced
of
the
fallacy
of
such
a
position
there
is
much
yet
to
be
learnt
and
if
there
be
present
either
member
associate
or
student
to
whom
i
have
imparted
the
smallest
instruction
i
shall
feel
that
i
have
not
unprofitably
occupied
my
time
this
evening
on
telpherage
footnote
introductory
address
delivered
to
the
class
of
engineering
university
of
edinburgh
october
by
professor
fleeming
jenkin
the
transmission
of
vehicles
by
electricity
to
a
distance
independently
of
any
control
exercised
from
the
vehicle
i
will
call
telpherage
these
words
are
quoted
from
my
first
patent
relating
to
this
subject
the
word
should
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
derivation
be
telphorage
but
as
this
word
sounds
badly
to
my
ear
i
ventured
to
adopt
such
a
modified
form
as
constant
usage
in
england
for
a
few
centuries
might
have
produced
and
i
was
the
more
ready
to
trust
to
my
ear
in
the
matter
because
the
word
telpher
relieves
us
from
the
confusion
which
might
arise
between
telephore
and
telephone
when
written
i
have
been
encouraged
to
choose
telpherage
as
the
subject
of
my
address
by
the
fact
that
a
public
exhibition
of
a
telpher
line
with
trains
running
on
it
will
be
made
this
afternoon
for
the
first
time
you
are
of
course
all
aware
that
electrical
railways
have
been
run
and
are
running
with
success
in
several
places
their
introduction
has
been
chiefly
due
to
the
energy
and
invention
of
siemens
i
do
not
doubt
of
their
success
and
great
extension
in
the
future
but
when
considering
the
earliest
examples
of
these
railways
in
the
spring
of
last
year
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
simply
adapting
electric
motors
to
the
old
form
of
railway
and
rolling
stock
inventors
had
not
gone
far
enough
back
george
stephenson
said
that
the
railway
and
locomotive
were
two
parts
of
one
machine
and
the
inference
seemed
to
follow
that
when
electric
motors
were
to
be
employed
a
new
form
of
road
and
a
new
type
of
train
would
be
desirable
when
using
steam
we
can
produce
the
power
most
economically
in
large
engines
and
we
can
control
the
power
most
effectually
and
most
cheaply
when
so
produced
a
separate
steam
engine
to
each
carriage
with
its
own
stoker
and
driver
could
not
compete
with
the
large
locomotive
and
heavy
train
but
these
imply
a
strong
and
costly
road
and
permanent
way
no
mechanical
method
of
distributing
power
so
as
to
pull
trains
along
at
a
distance
from
a
stationary
engine
has
been
successful
on
our
railways
but
now
that
electricity
has
given
us
new
and
unrivaled
means
for
the
distribution
of
power
the
problem
requires
reconsideration
with
the
help
of
an
electric
current
as
the
transmitter
of
power
we
can
draw
off
as
it
were
one
two
or
three
from
a
hundred
different
points
of
a
conductor
many
miles
long
with
as
much
ease
as
we
can
obtain
or
at
any
one
point
we
can
cut
off
the
power
from
any
single
motor
by
the
mere
break
of
contact
between
two
pieces
of
metal
we
can
restore
the
power
by
merely
letting
the
two
pieces
of
metal
touch
we
can
make
these
changes
by
electro
magnets
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
and
we
can
deal
as
we
please
with
each
of
one
hundred
motors
without
sensibly
affecting
the
others
these
considerations
led
me
to
conclude
in
the
first
place
that
when
using
electricity
we
might
with
advantage
subdivide
the
weight
to
be
carried
distributing
the
load
among
many
light
vehicles
following
each
other
in
an
almost
continuous
stream
instead
of
concentrating
the
load
in
heavy
trains
widely
spaced
as
in
our
actual
railways
the
change
in
the
distribution
of
the
load
would
allow
us
to
adopt
a
cheap
light
form
of
load
the
wide
distribution
of
weight
entails
many
small
trains
in
substitution
for
a
single
heavy
train
these
small
trains
could
not
be
economically
run
if
a
separate
driver
were
required
for
each
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
electricity
not
only
facilitates
the
distribution
of
power
but
gives
a
ready
means
of
controlling
that
power
our
light
continuous
stream
of
trains
can
therefore
be
worked
automatically
or
managed
independently
of
any
guard
or
driver
accompanying
the
train
in
other
words
i
could
arrange
a
block
for
preventing
collisions
next
came
the
question
what
would
be
the
best
form
of
substructure
for
the
new
mode
of
conveyance
suspended
rods
or
ropes
at
a
considerable
height
appeared
to
me
to
have
great
advantages
over
any
road
on
the
level
of
the
ground
the
suspended
rods
also
seemed
superior
to
any
stiff
form
of
rail
or
girder
supported
at
a
height
the
insulation
of
ropes
with
few
supports
would
be
easy
they
could
cross
the
country
with
no
bridges
or
they
would
remove
the
electrical
conductor
to
a
safe
distance
from
men
and
cattle
cheap
small
rods
employed
as
so
many
light
suspension
bridges
would
support
in
the
aggregate
a
large
weight
moreover
i
consider
that
a
single
rod
or
rail
would
present
great
advantages
over
any
double
rail
system
provided
any
suitable
means
could
be
devised
for
driving
a
train
along
a
single
track
up
to
that
time
two
conductors
had
invariably
been
used
it
also
seemed
desirable
that
the
metal
rod
bearing
the
train
should
also
convey
the
current
driving
it
lines
such
as
i
contemplated
would
not
impede
cultivation
nor
interfere
with
fencing
ground
need
not
be
purchased
for
their
erection
mere
wayleaves
would
be
sufficient
as
in
the
case
of
telegraphs
my
ideas
had
reached
this
point
in
the
spring
of
and
i
had
devised
some
means
for
carrying
them
into
effect
when
i
read
the
account
of
the
electrical
railway
exhibited
by
professors
ayrton
and
perry
in
connection
with
this
railway
they
had
contrived
means
rendering
the
control
of
the
vehicles
independent
of
the
action
of
the
guard
or
driver
and
this
absolute
block
as
they
called
their
system
seemed
to
me
all
that
was
required
to
enable
me
at
once
to
carry
out
my
idea
of
a
continuous
stream
of
light
evenly
spaced
trains
with
no
drivers
or
guards
i
saw
moreover
that
the
development
of
the
system
i
had
in
view
would
be
a
severe
tax
on
my
time
and
energy
also
that
in
edinburgh
i
was
not
well
placed
for
pushing
such
a
scheme
and
i
had
formed
a
high
opinion
of
the
value
of
the
assistance
which
professors
ayrton
and
perry
could
give
in
designs
and
inventions
moved
by
these
considerations
i
wrote
asking
professor
ayrton
to
in
the
development
of
my
scheme
and
suggesting
that
he
should
join
with
me
in
taking
out
my
first
telpher
patent
it
has
been
found
more
convenient
to
keep
our
several
patents
distinct
but
my
letter
ultimately
led
to
the
formation
of
the
telpherage
company
limited
in
which
professor
ayrton
professor
perry
and
i
have
equal
interests
this
company
owns
all
our
inventions
in
respect
of
electric
locomotion
and
the
line
shown
in
action
has
been
erected
by
this
company
on
the
estate
of
the
chairman
marlborough
pryor
of
weston
since
the
summer
of
last
year
and
more
especially
since
the
formation
of
the
company
this
spring
much
time
and
thought
has
been
spent
in
elaborating
details
we
are
still
far
from
the
end
of
our
work
and
it
is
highly
probable
what
has
been
done
will
change
rapidly
by
a
natural
process
of
evolution
nevertheless
the
actual
line
now
working
does
in
all
its
main
features
accurately
reproduce
my
first
conception
and
the
general
principles
i
have
just
laid
down
will
i
think
remain
true
however
great
the
change
in
details
may
be
the
line
at
weston
consist
of
a
series
of
posts
apart
with
two
lines
of
rods
or
ropes
supported
by
crossheads
on
the
posts
each
of
these
lines
carries
a
train
one
in
fact
is
the
up
line
and
the
other
the
down
line
square
steel
rods
round
steel
rods
and
steel
wire
ropes
are
all
in
course
of
trial
the
round
steel
rod
is
my
favorite
road
at
present
the
line
is
divided
into
sections
of
or
two
spans
and
each
section
is
insulated
from
its
neighbor
the
rod
or
rope
is
at
the
post
supported
by
saddles
curved
in
a
vertical
plane
so
as
to
facilitate
the
passage
of
the
wheels
over
the
point
of
support
each
alternate
section
is
insulated
from
the
ground
all
the
insulated
sections
are
in
electrical
connection
with
one
another
so
are
all
the
uninsulated
sections
the
train
is
long
the
same
length
as
that
of
a
section
it
consists
of
a
series
of
seven
buckets
and
a
locomotive
evenly
spaced
with
ash
distance
pieces
each
bucket
will
convey
as
a
useful
load
about
and
the
bucket
or
skep
as
it
has
come
to
be
called
weighs
with
its
load
about
cwt
the
locomotive
also
weighs
about
cwt
the
skeps
hang
below
the
line
from
one
or
from
two
v
wheels
supported
by
arms
which
project
out
sideways
so
as
to
clear
the
supports
at
the
posts
the
motor
or
dynamo
on
the
locomotive
is
also
below
the
line
it
is
supported
on
two
broad
flat
wheels
and
is
driven
by
two
horizontal
gripping
wheels
the
connection
of
these
with
the
motor
is
made
by
a
new
kind
of
frictional
gear
which
i
have
called
nest
gear
but
which
i
can
not
describe
the
motor
on
the
locomotive
as
a
maximum
when
so
much
is
needed
a
wire
connects
one
pole
of
the
motor
with
the
leading
wheel
of
the
train
and
a
second
wire
connects
the
other
pole
with
the
trailing
wheel
the
other
wheels
are
insulated
from
each
other
thus
the
train
wherever
it
stands
bridges
a
gap
separating
the
insulated
from
the
uninsulated
section
the
insulated
sections
are
supplied
with
electricity
from
a
dynamo
driven
by
a
stationary
engine
and
the
current
passing
from
the
insulated
section
to
the
uninsulated
section
through
the
motor
drives
the
locomotive
the
actual
line
is
quite
short
and
can
only
show
two
trains
one
on
the
up
and
one
on
the
down
line
but
with
sufficient
power
at
the
station
any
number
of
trains
could
be
driven
in
a
continuous
stream
on
each
line
the
appearance
is
that
of
a
line
of
buckets
running
along
a
single
telegraph
wire
of
large
size
a
block
system
is
devised
and
partly
made
but
is
not
yet
erected
it
differs
from
the
earlier
proposals
in
having
no
working
parts
on
the
line
this
system
of
propulsion
is
called
by
us
the
cross
over
parallel
arc
other
systems
of
supplying
the
currents
devised
both
by
professors
ayrton
and
perry
and
myself
will
be
tried
on
lines
now
being
erected
but
that
just
described
gives
good
results
the
motors
employed
in
the
locomotives
were
invented
by
ayrton
and
perry
they
are
believed
to
have
the
special
advantage
of
giving
a
larger
power
for
a
given
weight
than
any
others
one
weighing
lb
gave
in
some
tests
lately
made
one
weighing
lb
gave
no
scientific
experiments
have
yet
been
made
on
the
working
of
the
line
and
matters
are
not
yet
ripe
for
this
but
we
know
that
we
can
erect
a
cheap
and
simple
permanent
way
which
will
convey
a
useful
load
of
say
cwt
on
every
alternate
span
of
feet
this
corresponds
to
tons
per
mile
which
running
at
five
miles
per
hour
would
convey
tons
of
goods
per
hour
thus
if
we
work
for
hours
the
line
will
convey
tons
of
goods
each
way
per
diem
which
seems
a
very
fair
performance
for
an
inch
rope
the
arrangement
of
the
line
with
only
one
rod
instead
of
two
rails
diminishes
friction
very
greatly
the
carriages
run
as
light
as
bicycles
the
same
peculiarity
allows
very
sharp
curves
to
be
taken
but
i
am
without
experimental
tests
as
yet
of
the
limit
in
this
respect
further
we
now
know
that
we
can
insulate
the
line
satisfactorily
even
if
very
high
potentials
come
to
be
employed
the
grip
of
the
locomotive
is
admirable
and
almost
frictionless
the
gear
is
silent
and
runs
very
easily
it
is
suited
for
the
highest
speeds
and
this
is
very
necessary
as
the
motors
may
with
advantage
run
at
revolutions
per
minute
machine
for
making
electric
light
carbons
one
of
the
hinderances
to
the
production
of
a
regular
and
steady
light
in
electric
illumination
is
the
absence
of
perfect
uniformity
in
the
carbons
this
defect
has
more
than
once
been
pointed
out
by
us
and
we
are
glad
to
notice
any
attempt
to
remedy
an
admitted
evil
to
this
end
we
illustrate
above
a
machine
for
manufacturing
carbons
invented
by
william
cunliffe
the
object
the
inventor
has
in
view
is
not
only
the
better
but
the
more
rapid
manufacture
of
carbons
candles
or
electrodes
for
electric
lighting
or
for
the
manufacture
of
rods
or
blocks
of
carbon
or
other
compressible
substances
for
other
purposes
and
his
invention
consists
in
automatic
machinery
whereby
a
regular
and
uniform
pressure
and
compression
of
the
carbon
is
obtained
and
the
rods
or
blocks
are
delivered
through
the
formers
in
a
state
of
greater
density
and
better
quality
then
hitherto
the

there
has
lately
been
held
at
no
lombard
street
london
a
private
exhibition
of
the
holmes
and
burke
primary
galvanic
battery
the
chief
object
of
the
display
was
to
demonstrate
its
suitability
for
the
lighting
of
railway
trains
but
at
the
same
time
means
were
provided
to
show
it
in
connection
with
ordinary
domestic
illumination
as
it
is
evident
that
a
battery
will
serve
equally
as
well
for
the
latter
as
for
the
former
purpose
already
the
great
northern
express
leaving
london
at
is
lighted
by
this
means
and
satisfactory
experiments
have
been
made
upon
the
line
while
the
inventors
give
a
long
list
of
other
companies
to
which
experimental
plant
is
to
be
supplied
the
battery
shown
in
lombard
street
consisted
of
fifteen
cells
arranged
in
three
boxes
of
five
cells
each
each
box
measured
about
in
by
in
by
and
weighed
from
lb
to
lb
the
electromotive
force
of
each
cell
was
volts
and
its
internal
resistance
from
to
of
an
ohm
consequently
the
battery
exhibited
had
under
the
must
favorable
circumstances
a
difference
of
potential
of
volts
at
its
poles
and
a
resistance
of
ohm
when
connected
to
a
group
of
ten
swan
lamps
of
five
candle
power
requiring
a
difference
of
potential
of
volts
it
raised
them
to
vivid
incandescence
considerably
above
their
nominal
capacity
but
it
failed
to
supply
eighteen
lamps
of
the
same
kind
satisfactorily
showing
that
its
working
capacity
lay
somewhere
between
the
two
a
more
powerful
lamp
is
used
in
the
railway
carriages
but
as
there
was
only
one
erected
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
the
number
that
a
battery
of
the
size
shown
would
feed
says
the
trial
however
demonstrated
that
great
quantities
of
current
were
being
continuously
evolved
and
if
as
we
understood
the
production
can
be
maintained
constant
for
about
hours
without
attention
the
new
battery
marks
a
distinct
step
in
this
kind
of
electric
lighting
of
the
construction
of
the
battery
we
unfortunately
can
say
but
little
as
the
patents
are
not
yet
completed
but
we
may
state
that
the
solid
elements
are
zinc
and
carbon
and
that
the
novelty
lies
in
the
liquid
and
in
the
ingenious
arrangement
for
supplying
and
withdrawing
it
ordinarily
one
charge
of
liquid
will
serve
for
hours
working
but
this
of
course
is
entirely
determined
by
the
space
provided
for
it
it
is
sold
at
sevenpence
a
gallon
and
each
gallon
is
sufficient
we
are
informed
to
drive
a
cell
while
it
generates
ampere
hours
of
current
or
taking
the
electromotive
force
at
volts
it
represents
x
hours
the
cost
of
the
zinc
is
stated
to
be
per
cent
of
that
of
the
fluid
although
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
this
can
be
for
one
requires
the
consumption
of
grammes
of
zinc
per
hour
or
and
this
at
per
ton
would
cost
pence
per
pound
or
pence
per
hour
this
added
to
pence
for
the
fluid
would
give
a
total
of
pence
per
per
hour
and
assuming
twenty
lamps
of
ten
candle
power
to
be
fed
per
the
cost
would
be
about
of
a
penny
per
hour
per
lamp
mr
holmes
admits
his
statement
of
the
consumption
of
zinc
does
not
agree
with
what
might
be
theoretically
expected
but
he
bases
it
upon
the
result
of
his
experiments
in
the
pullman
train
which
place
the
cost
at
one
farthing
per
hour
per
light
at
the
same
time
he
does
not
profess
that
the
battery
can
compete
in
the
matter
of
cost
with
mechanically
generated
currents
on
a
large
scale
but
he
offers
it
as
a
convenient
means
of
obtaining
the
electric
light
in
places
where
a
steam
engine
or
a
gas
engine
is
inadmissible
as
in
a
private
house
and
where
the
cost
of
driving
a
dynamo
machine
is
raised
abnormally
high
by
reason
of
a
special
attendant
having
to
be
paid
to
look
after
it
but
he
has
another
scheme
for
the
reduction
of
the
cost
to
which
we
have
not
yet
alluded
and
of
which
we
can
say
but
little
as
the
details
are
not
at
present
available
for
publication
the
battery
gives
off
fumes
which
can
be
condensed
into
a
nitrogenous
substance
valuable
it
is
stated
as
a
manure
while
the
zinc
salts
in
the
spent
liquid
can
be
recovered
and
returned
to
useful
purposes
how
far
this
is
practicable
it
is
at
present
impossible
to
say
but
at
any
rate
the
idea
represents
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
if
the
electricians
can
follow
the
example
of
the
gas
manufacturers
and
obtain
a
revenue
from
the
residuals
of
galvanic
batteries
they
will
greatly
improve
their
commercial
position
there
is
nothing
impossible
in
the
idea
and
neither
is
it
altogether
novel
although
the
way
of
carrying
it
out
may
be
in
staite
one
of
the
early
enthusiasts
in
electric
lighting
patented
a
series
of
batteries
from
which
he
proposed
to
recover
sulphate
nitrate
and
chloride
of
zinc
but
we
never
heard
that
he
obtained
any
success
new
electric
railway
the
original
electric
railway
laid
down
by
siemens
and
halske
at
berlin
seems
likely
to
be
the
parent
of
many
others
one
of
the
most
recent
is
the
underground
electric
line
laid
down
by
the
firm
in
the
mines
of
zankerodain
saxony
an
account
of
this
railway
has
appeared
in
together
with
drawings
of
the
engine
which
we
are
able
to
reproduce
they
are
derived
from
a
paper
by
herr
fischer
read
on
the
december
before
the
union
of
germany
the
line
in
question
is
meters
long
yards
and
has
two
lines
of
way
it
lies
meters
yards
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
it
is
worked
by
an
electric
locomotive
hauling
ten
wagons
at
a
speed
of
kilometers
or
miles
per
hour
the
total
weight
drawn
is
eight
tons
the
gauge
is
a
narrow
one
so
that
the
locomotive
can
be
made
of
small
dimensions
its
total
length
between
the
buffer
heads
is
meters
its
height
meters
breadth
meter
diameter
of
wheels
meter
from
the
rail
head
to
the
center
of
the
buffers
is
a
height
of
meter
and
the
total
weight
is
only
kilogrammes
or
say
lb
we
give
a
longitudinal
section
through
the
locomotive
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
a
seat
at
each
end
for
the
driver
so
that
he
can
always
look
forwards
whichever
way
the
engine
may
be
running
the
arrangements
for
connection
with
the
electric
current
are
very
simple
the
current
is
generated
by
a
dynamo
machine
fixed
outside
the
mine
and
run
by
a
small
rotary
steam
engine
shown
in
section
and
elevation
at
a
speed
of
revolutions
per
minute
the
current
passes
through
a
cable
down
the
shaft
to
a
fixed
to
the
side
of
the
heading
on
this
slide
contact
pieces
which
are
connected
with
the
electric
engine
by
leading
wires
the
driver
by
turning
a
handle
can
move
his
engine
backward
or
forward
at
will
the
whole
arrangement
has
worked
extremely
well
and
it
is
stated
that
the
locomotive
if
so
arranged
could
easily
do
double
its
present
work
in
other
words
could
haul
to
tons
of
train
load
at
a
speed
of
seven
miles
an
hour
the
arrangements
for
the
dynamo
machine
on
the
engine
and
its
connection
with
the
wheels
are
much
the
same
as
those
used
in
sir
william
siemens
electric
railway
now
working
near
the
giant
illustration
the
siemens
electric
railway
at
zankeroda
mines
the
earliest
lebon
in
the
certificate
dated
in
addition
to
his
first
patent
described
and
illustrated
a
in
which
an
explosive
mixture
of
gas
and
air
was
to
have
been
ignited
by
an
electric
spark
this
is
a
curious
anticipation
of
the
lenior
system
not
brought
out
until
more
than
fifty
years
later
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
lebon
ever
constructed
an
engine
after
the
design
referred
to
it
is
an
instructive
lesson
to
patentees
who
frequently
expect
to
reap
immediate
fame
and
fortune
from
their
property
in
some
crude
ideas
which
they
fondly
deem
to
be
an
invention
to
observe
the
very
wide
interval
that
separates
lebon
from
otto
the
idea
is
the
same
in
both
cases
but
it
has
required
long
years
of
patient
work
and
many
failures
to
embody
the
idea
in
a
suitable
form
it
is
almost
surprising
to
any
one
who
has
not
specially
studied
the
matter
to
discover
the
number
of
devices
that
have
been
tried
with
the
object
of
making
an
explosion
engine
as
distinguished
from
one
deriving
its
motive
power
from
the
expansion
of
gaseous
fluids
a
narrative
of
some
of
these
attempts
has
been
presented
to
the
societe
des
ingenieurs
civils
mostly
taken
in
the
first
place
from
stuart
work
upon
the
origin
of
the
steam
engine
published
in
and
now
somewhat
scarce
it
appears
from
this
statement
that
so
long
ago
as
robert
street
described
and
patented
an
engine
in
winch
the
piston
was
to
be
driven
by
the
explosion
of
a
gaseous
mixture
whereof
the
combustible
element
was
furnished
by
the
vaporization
of
turpentine
thrown
upon
red
hot
iron
in
de
rivaz
applied
the
same
idea
in
a
different
manner
he
employed
a
cylinder
centimeters
in
diameter
fitted
with
a
piston
at
the
bottom
of
the
cylinder
there
was
another
smaller
one
also
provided
with
a
piston
this
was
the
aspirating
cylinder
which
drew
hydrogen
from
an
inflated
bag
and
mixed
it
with
twice
its
bulk
of
air
by
means
of
a
cock
the
ignition
of
the
detonating
mixture
was
effected
by
an
electric
spark
it
is
said
that
the
inventor
applied
his
apparatus
to
a
small
locomotive
in
cecil
of
cambridge
proposed
the
employment
of
a
mixture
of
air
and
hydrogen
as
a
source
of
motive
power
he
gave
a
detailed
account
of
his
invention
in
the
of
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
together
with
some
interesting
theoretical
considerations
the
author
observes
here
that
an
explosion
may
be
safely
opposed
by
an
elastic
resistance
that
of
compressed
air
for
example
if
such
resistance
possesses
little
or
no
inertia
to
be
brought
into
play
contrariwise
the
smallest
inertia
opposed
to
the
explosion
of
a
mixture
subjected
to
instantaneous
combustion
is
equivalent
to
an
insurmountable
obstacle
thus
a
small
quantity
of
gunpowder
or
a
detonating
mixture
of
air
and
hydrogen
may
without
danger
be
ignited
in
a
large
closed
vessel
full
of
air
because
the
pressure
against
the
sides
of
the
vessel
exerted
by
the
explosion
is
not
more
than
the
pressure
of
the
air
compressed
by
the
explosion
if
a
piece
of
card
board
or
even
of
paper
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
bore
of
a
cannon
charged
with
powder
the
cannon
will
almost
certainly
burst
because
the
powder
in
detonating
acts
upon
a
body
in
repose
which
can
only
be
put
in
motion
in
a
period
of
time
infinitely
little
by
the
intervention
of
a
force
infinitely
great
the
piece
of
paper
is
therefore
equivalent
to
an
insurmountable
obstacle
of
all
detonating
mixtures
or
explosive
materials
the
most
dangerous
for
equal
expansions
and
the
least
fitted
for
use
as
motive
power
are
those
which
inflame
the
most
rapidly
thus
a
mixture
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
in
which
the
inflammation
is
produced
instantaneously
is
less
convenient
for
this
particular
usage
than
a
mixture
of
air
and
hydrogen
which
inflames
more
slowly
from
this
point
of
view
ordinary
gunpowder
would
make
a
good
source
of
motive
power
because
notwithstanding
its
great
power
of
dilatation
it
is
comparatively
slow
of
ignition
only
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
particular
precautions
to
place
the
moving
body
in
close
contact
with
the
powder
cecil
pointed
out
that
while
a
small
steam
engine
could
not
be
started
in
work
in
less
than
half
an
hour
or
probably
more
a
gas
engine
such
as
he
proposed
would
have
the
advantage
of
being
always
ready
for
immediate
use
cecil
engine
was
the
first
in
which
the
explosive
mixture
was
ignited
by
a
simple
flame
of
gas
drawn
into
the
cylinder
at
the
right
moment
in
the
first
model
which
was
that
of
a
vertical
beam
engine
with
a
long
cylinder
of
comparatively
small
diameter
the
motive
power
was
simply
derived
from
the
descent
of
the
piston
by
atmospheric
pressure
but
cecil
is
careful
to
state
that
power
may
also
be
obtained
directly
from
the
force
of
the
explosion
the
engine
was
worked
with
a
cylinder
pressure
of
about
atmospheres
and
the
inventor
seems
to
have
recognized
that
the
noise
of
the
explosions
might
be
an
objection
to
the
machine
for
he
suggests
putting
the
end
of
the
cylinder
down
in
a
well
or
inclosing
it
in
a
tight
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
deadening
the
shock
it
is
interesting
to
rescue
for
a
moment
the
account
of
invention
from
the
obscurity
into
which
it
has
fallen
obscurity
which
the
ingenuity
of
the
ideas
embodied
in
this
machine
does
not
merit
it
is
probable
that
in
addition
to
the
imperfections
of
his
machinery
cecil
suffered
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
hydrogen
at
a
sufficiently
low
price
for
use
in
large
quantities
it
does
not
transpire
that
the
inventor
ever
seriously
turned
his
attention
to
the
advantages
of
coal
gas
which
even
at
that
time
although
very
dear
must
have
been
much
cheaper
than
hydrogen
knowing
what
we
do
at
present
however
of
the
consumption
of
gas
by
a
good
engine
of
the
latest
pattern
it
may
be
assumed
that
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
of
the
gas
engine
builders
of
years
ago
arose
from
the
simple
fact
of
their
being
altogether
before
their
age
of
course
the
steam
engine
of
was
a
much
more
wasteful
machine
as
well
as
more
costly
to
build
than
the
steam
engine
of
but
the
difference
can
not
have
been
so
great
as
to
create
an
advantage
in
favor
of
an
appliance
which
required
even
greater
nicety
of
construction
the
best
at
present
made
would
have
been
an
expensive
thing
to
supply
with
gas
at
the
prices
current
in
even
if
the
resources
of
mechanical
science
at
that
date
had
been
equal
to
its
construction
which
we
know
was
not
the
case
still
this
consideration
was
not
known
or
was
little
valued
by
cecil
and
his
contemporaries
it
was
not
long
however
before
cecil
had
to
give
way
before
a
formidable
rival
for
in
samuel
brown
brought
out
his
engine
which
was
in
many
respects
an
improvement
upon
the
one
already
described
it
will
probably
be
right
however
to
regard
the
rev
cecil
of
cambridge
as
the
first
to
make
a
practicable
model

nearly
the

slightly
broken

in

the

presented

little

kilometers

took
four
days
to
transport
the
first

distance
but
it
required
only
a
day
and
a
half
to
move
the
other
one
since
the
ground
had
acquired
more
compactness
as
a
consequence
of
moving
the
first
one
over
it
and
since
the

had
become
more
expert
the
six
hundred

at

disposal
had
moreover
been
employed
for
three
months
back
in
preparing
the

in
strengthening
it
with

in
certain
spots
and
in
paving
others
with

from

of

i
shall
describe
how
i
a
few
years
ago
moved
an
ammunition
stone
house
weighing
tons
to
a
distance
of
meters
without
any
other
machine
than
a
capstan
actuated
by
two
de
rochas
in
la
nature
science
and
engineering
in
the
address
delivered
by
westmacott
president
of
the
institution
of
mechanical
engineers
to
the
english
and
belgian
engineers
assembled
at
liege
last
august
there
occurred
the
following
passage
engineering
brings
all
other
sciences
into
play
chemical
or
physical
discoveries
such
as
those
of
faraday
would
be
of
little
practical
use
if
engineers
were
not
ready
with
mechanical
appliances
to
carry
them
out
and
make
them
commercially
successful
in
the
way
best
suited
to
each
we
have
no
objection
to
make
to
these
words
spoken
at
such
a
time
and
before
such
an
assembly
it
would
of
course
be
easy
to
take
the
converse
view
and
observe
that
engineering
would
have
made
little
progress
in
modern
times
but
for
the
splendid
resources
which
the
discoveries
of
pure
science
have
placed
at
her
disposal
and
which
she
has
only
had
to
adopt
and
utilize
for
her
own
purposes
but
there
is
no
need
to
quarrel
over
two
opposite
modes
of
stating
the
same
fact
there
need
on
the
other
hand
that
the
fact
itself
should
be
fairly
recognized
and
accepted
namely
that
science
may
be
looked
upon
as
at
once
the
handmaid
and
the
guide
of
art
art
as
at
once
the
pupil
and
the
supporter
of
science
in
the
present
article
we
propose
to
give
a
few
illustrations
which
will
bring
out
and
emphasize
this
truth
we
could
scarcely
find
a
better
instance
than
is
furnished
to
our
hand
in
the
sentence
we
have
chosen
for
a
text
no
man
ever
worked
with
a
more
single
hearted
devotion
to
pure
science
with
a
more
absolute
disregard
of
money
or
fame
as
compared
with
knowledge
than
michael
faraday
yet
future
ages
will
perhaps
judge
that
no
stronger
impulse
was
ever
given
to
the
progress
of
industrial
art
or
to
the
advancement
of
the
material
interests
of
mankind
than
the
impulse
which
sprang
from
his
discoveries
in
electricity
and
magnetism
of
these
discoveries
we
are
only
now
beginning
to
reap
the
benefit
but
we
have
merely
to
consider
the
position
which
the
machine
already
occupies
in
the
industrial
world
and
the
far
higher
position
which
as
almost
all
admit
it
is
destined
to
occupy
in
the
future
in
order
to
see
how
much
we
owe
to
faraday
establishment
of
the
connection
between
magnetism
and
electricity
that
is
one
side
of
the
question
the
debt
which
art
owes
to
science
but
let
us
look
at
the
other
side
also
does
science
owe
nothing
to
art
will
any
one
say
that
we
should
know
as
much
as
we
do
concerning
the
theory
of
the
motor
and
the
laws
of
action
generally
if
that
motor
had
never
risen
or
fallen
as
you
choose
to
put
it
to
be
something
besides
the
instrument
of
a
laboratory
or
the
toy
of
a
lecture
room
only
a
short
time
since
the
illustrious
french
physicist
tresca
was
enumerating
the
various
sources
of
loss
in
the
transmission
of
power
by
electricity
along
a
fixed
wire
as
elucidated
in
the
careful
and
elaborate
experiments
inaugurated
by
marcel
deprez
and
subsequently
continued
by
himself
these
losses
the
electrical
no
less
than
the
mechanical
losses
are
being
thoroughly
and
minutely
examined
in
the
hope
of
reducing
them
to
the
lowest
limit
and
this
examination
can
not
fail
to
throw
much
light
on
the
exact
distribution
of
the
energy
imparted
to
a
dynamo
machine
and
the
laws
by
which
this
distribution
is
governed
but
would
this
examination
ever
have
taken
place
would
the
costly
experiments
which
render
it
feasible
ever
have
been
performed
if
the
dynamo
machine
was
still
under
the
undisputed
control
of
pure
science
and
had
not
become
subject
to
the
sway
of
the
capitalist
and
the
engineer
of
course
the
electric
telegraph
affords
an
earlier
and
perhaps
as
good
an
illustration
of
the
same
fact
the
discovery
that
electricity
would
pass
along
a
wire
and
actuate
a
needle
at
the
other
end
was
at
first
a
purely
scientific
one
and
it
was
only
gradually
that
its
importance
from
an
industrial
point
of
view
came
to
be
recognized
here
again
art
owes
to
pure
science
the
creation
of
a
complete
and
important
branch
of
engineering
whose
works
are
spread
like
a
net
over
the
whole
face
of
the
globe
on
the
other
hand
our
knowledge
of
electricity
and
especially
of
the
electrochemical
processes
which
go
on
in
the
working
of
batteries
has
been
enormously
improved
in
consequence
of
the
use
of
such
batteries
for
the
purposes
of
telegraphy
let
us
turn
to
another
example
in
a
different
branch
of
science
whichever
of
our
modern
discoveries
we
may
consider
to
be
the
most
startling
and
important
there
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
that
the
most
beautiful
is
that
of
the
spectroscope
it
has
enabled
us
to
do
that
which
but
a
few
years
before
its
introduction
was
taken
for
the
very
type
of
the
impossible
to
study
the
chemical
composition
of
the
stars
and
it
is
giving
us
clearer
and
clearer
insight
every
day
into
the
condition
of
the
great
luminary
which
forms
the
center
of
our
system
still
however
beautiful
and
interesting
such
results
may
be
it
might
well
be
thought
that
they
could
never
have
any
practical
application
and
that
the
spectroscope
at
least
would
remain
an
instrument
of
science
but
of
science
alone
this
however
is
not
the
case
some
thirty
years
since
bessemer
conceived
the
idea
that
the
injurious
constituents
of
raw
iron
such
as
silicon
sulphur
might
be
got
rid
of
by
simple
oxidation
the
mass
of
crude
metal
was
heated
to
a
very
high
temperature
atmospheric
air
was
forced
through
it
at
a
considerable
pressure
and
the
oxygen
uniting
with
these
metalloids
carried
them
off
in
the
form
of
acid
gases
the
very
act
of
union
generated
a
vast
quantity
of
heat
which
itself
assisted
the
continuance
of
the
process
and
the
gas
therefore
passed
off
in
a
highly
luminous
condition
but
the
important
point
was
to
know
where
to
stop
to
seize
the
exact
moment
when
all
or
practically
all
hurtful
ingredients
had
been
removed
and
before
the
oxygen
had
turned
from
them
to
attack
the
iron
itself
how
was
this
point
to
be
ascertained
it
was
soon
suggested
that
each
of
these
gases
in
its
incandescent
state
would
show
its
own
peculiar
spectrum
and
that
if
the
flame
rushing
out
of
the
throat
of
the
converter
were
viewed
through
a
spectroscope
the
moment
when
any
substance
such
as
sulphur
had
disappeared
would
be
known
by
the
disappearance
of
the
corresponding
lines
in
the
spectrum
the
anticipation
it
is
needless
to
say
was
verified
and
the
spectroscope
though
now
superseded
had
for
a
time
its
place
among
the
regular
appliances
necessary
for
the
carrying
on
of
the
bessemer
process
this
process
itself
with
all
the
momentous
consequences
mechanical
commercial
and
economical
which
it
has
entailed
might
be
brought
forward
as
a
witness
on
our
side
for
it
was
almost
completely
worked
out
in
the
laboratory
before
being
submitted
to
actual
practice
in
this
respect
it
stands
in
marked
contrast
to
the
earlier
processes
for
the
making
of
iron
and
steel
which
were
developed
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
in
the
forge
or
furnace
itself
and
amid
the
smoke
and
din
of
practical
work
at
the
same
time
the
experiments
of
bessemer
were
for
the
most
part
carried
out
with
a
distinct
eye
to
their
future
application
in
practice
and
their
value
for
our
present
purpose
is
therefore
not
so
great
the
same
we
believe
may
be
said
with
regard
to
the
great
rival
of
the
bessemer
converter
the
siemens
open
hearth
although
this
forms
in
itself
a
beautiful
application
of
the
scientific
doctrine
that
steel
stands
midway
as
regards
proportion
of
carbon
between
wrought
iron
and
pig
iron
and
ought
therefore
to
be
obtainable
by
a
judicious
mixture
of
the
two
the
basic
process
is
the
latest
development
in
this
direction
of
science
as
applied
to
metallurgy
here
by
simply
giving
a
different
chemical
constitution
to
the
clay
lining
of
the
converter
it
is
found
possible
to
eliminate
phosphorus
an
element
which
has
successfully
withstood
the
attack
of
the
bessemer
system
now
to
quote
the
words
of
a
german
eulogizer
of
the
new
method
phosphorus
has
been
turned
from
an
enemy
into
a
friend
and
the
richer
a
given
ore
is
in
that
substance
the
more
readily
and
cheaply
does
it
seem
likely
to
be
converted
into
steel
these
latter
examples
have
been
taken
from
the
art
of
metallurgy
and
it
may
of
course
be
said
that
considering
the
intimate
relations
between
that
art
and
the
science
of
chemistry
there
can
be
no
wonder
if
the
former
is
largely
dependent
for
its
progress
on
the
latter
i
will
therefore
turn
to
what
may
appear
the
most
concrete
practical
and
unscientific
of
all
arts
that
namely
of
the
mechanical
engineer
and
we
shall
find
that
even
here
examples
will
not
fail
us
of
the
boons
which
pure
science
has
conferred
upon
the
art
of
construction
nor
even
perhaps
of
the
reciprocal
advantages
which
she
has
derived
from
the
connection
the
address
of
westmacott
from
which
i
have
already
taken
my
text
supplies
in
itself
more
than
one
instance
of
the
kind
we
seek
instances
emphasized
by
papers
read
at
the
meeting
where
the
address
was
spoken
let
us
take
first
the
manufacture
of
sugar
from
beetroot
this
manufacture
was
forced
into
prominence
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
when
the
continental
blockade
maintained
by
england
against
napoleon
prevented
all
importation
of
sugar
from
america
and
it
has
now
attained
very
large
dimensions
as
all
frequenters
of
the
continent
must
be
aware
the
process
as
exhaustively
described
by
a
belgian
engineer
melin
offers
several
instances
of
the
application
of
chemical
and
physical
science
to
practical
purposes
thus
the
first
operation
in
making
sugar
from
beetroot
is
to
separate
the
juice
from
the
flesh
the
former
being
as
much
as
per
cent
of
the
whole
weight
formerly
this
was
accomplished
by
rasping
the
roots
into
a
pulp
and
then
pressing
the
pulp
in
powerful
hydraulic
presses
in
other
words
by
purely
mechanical
means
this
process
is
now
to
a
large
extent
superseded
by
what
is
called
the
diffusion
process
depending
on
the
well
known
physical
phenomena
of
and
the
beetroot
is
cut
up
into
small
slices
called
cossettes
and
these
are
placed
in
vessels
filled
with
water
the
result
is
that
a
current
of
endosmosis
takes
place
from
the
water
toward
the
juice
in
the
cells
and
a
current
of
exosmosis
from
the
juice
toward
the
water
these
currents
go
on
cell
by
cell
and
continue
until
a
state
of
equilibrium
is
attained
the
richer
the
water
and
the
poorer
the
juice
the
sooner
does
this
equilibrium
take
place
consequently
the
vessels
are
arranged
in
a
series
forming
what
is
called
a
diffusion
battery
the
pure
water
is
admitted
to
the
first
vessel
in
which
the
slices
have
already
been
nearly
exhausted
and
subtracts
from
them
what
juice
there
is
left
it
then
passes
as
a
thin
juice
to
the
next
vessel
in
which
the
slices
are
richer
and
the
process
begins
again
in
the
last
vessel
the
water
which
has
already
done
its
work
in
all
the
previous
vessels
comes
into
contact
with
fresh
slices
and
begins
the
operation
upon
them
the
same
process
has
been
applied
at
the
other
end
of
the
manufacture
of
sugar
after
the
juice
has
been
purified
and
all
the
crystallizable
sugar
has
been
separated
from
it
by
boiling
there
is
left
a
mass
of
molasses
containing
so
much
of
the
salts
of
potassium
and
sodium
that
no
further
crystallization
of
the
yet
remaining
sugar
is
possible
the
object
of
the
process
called
osmosis
is
to
carry
off
these
salts
the
apparatus
used
or
osmogene
consists
of
a
series
of
trays
filled
alternately
with
molasses
and
water
the
bottoms
being
formed
of
parchment
paper
a
current
passes
through
this
paper
in
each
direction
part
of
the
water
entering
the
molasses
and
part
of
the
salts
together
with
a
certain
quantity
of
sugar
entering
the
water
the
result
of
thus
freeing
the
molasses
from
the
salts
is
that
a
large
part
of
the
remaining
sugar
can
now
be
extracted
by
crystallization
another
instance
in
point
comes
from
a
paper
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
construction
of
long
tunnels
in
england
this
has
been
chiefly
discussed
of
late
in
connection
with
the
channel
tunnel
where
however
the
conditions
are
comparatively
simple
it
is
of
still
greater
importance
abroad
two
tunnels
have
already
been
pierced
through
the
alps
a
third
is
nearly
completed
and
a
fourth
the
simplon
tunnel
which
will
be
the
longest
of
any
is
at
this
moment
the
subject
of
a
most
active
study
on
the
part
of
french
engineers
in
america
especially
in
connection
with
the
deep
mines
of
the
western
states
the
problem
is
also
of
the
highest
importance
but
the
driving
of
such
tunnels
would
be
financially
if
not
physically
impossible
but
for
the
resources
which
science
has
placed
in
our
hands
first
by
the
preparation
of
new
explosives
and
secondly
by
methods
of
dealing
with
the
very
high
temperatures
which
have
to
be
encountered
as
regards
the
first
the
history
of
explosives
is
scarcely
anything
else
than
a
record
of
the
application
of
chemical
principles
to
practical
purposes
a
record
which
in
great
part
has
yet
to
be
written
and
on
which
we
can
not
here
dwell
it
is
certain
however
that
but
for
the
invention
of
nitroglycerine
a
purely
chemical
compound
and
its
development
in
various
forms
more
or
less
safe
and
convenient
these
long
tunnels
would
never
have
been
constructed
as
regards
the
second
point
the
question
of
temperature
is
really
the
most
formidable
with
which
the
tunnel
engineer
has
to
contend
in
the
gothard
tunnel
just
before
the
meeting
of
the
two
headings
in
february
the
temperature
rose
as
high
as
fahr
this
combined
with
the
foulness
of
the
air
produced
an
immense
diminution
in
the
work
done
per
person
and
per
horse
employed
while
several
men
were
actually
killed
by
the
dynamite
gases
and
others
suffered
from
a
disease
which
was
traced
to
a
hitherto
unknown
species
of
internal
worm
if
the
simplon
tunnel
should
be
constructed
yet
higher
temperatures
may
probably
have
to
be
dealt
with
although
science
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
completely
mastered
these
difficulties
much
has
been
done
in
that
direction
a
great
deal
of
mechanical
work
has
of
course
to
be
carried
on
at
the
face
or
far
end
of
such
a
heading
and
there
are
various
means
by
which
it
might
be
done
but
by
far
the
most
satisfactory
solution
in
most
cases
at
least
is
obtained
by
taking
advantage
of
the
properties
of
compressed
air
air
can
be
compressed
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
either
by
or
still
better
by
turbines
where
water
power
is
available
this
compressed
air
may
easily
be
led
in
pipes
to
the
face
of
the
heading
and
used
there
to
drive
the
small
engines
which
work
the
machines
etc
the
efficiency
of
such
machines
is
doubtless
low
chiefly
owing
to
the
physical
fact
that
the
air
is
heated
by
compression
and
that
much
of
this
heat
is
lost
while
it
traverses
the
long
line
of
pipes
leading
to
the
scene
of
action
but
here
we
have
a
great
advantage
from
the
point
of
view
of
ventilation
for
as
the
air
gained
heat
while
being
compressed
so
it
loses
heat
while
expanding
and
the
result
is
that
a
current
of
cold
and
fresh
air
is
continually
issuing
from
the
machines
at
the
face
of
the
heading
just
where
it
is
most
wanted
in
consequence
in
the
gothard
as
just
alluded
to
the
hottest
parts
were
always
some
little
distance
behind
the
face
of
the
heading
although
in
this
case
as
much
as
cubic
meters
of
air
taken
at
atmospheric
pressure
were
daily
poured
into
the
heading
yet
the
ventilation
was
very
insufficient
moreover
the
high
pressure
which
is
used
for
working
the
machines
is
not
the
best
adapted
for
ventilation
and
in
the
arlberg
tunnel
separate
ventilating
pipes
are
employed
containing
air
compressed
to
about
one
atmosphere
which
is
delivered
in
much
larger
quantities
although
not
at
so
low
a
temperature
in
connection
with
this
question
of
ventilation
a
long
series
of
observations
have
been
taken
at
the
gothard
both
during
and
since
the
construction
these
have
revealed
the
important
physical
fact
itself
of
high
practical
importance
that
the
barometer
never
stands
at
the
same
level
on
the
two
sides
of
a
great
mountain
chain
and
so
have
made
valuable
contributions
to
the
science
of
meteorology
another
most
important
use
of
the
same
scientific
fact
namely
the
properties
of
compressed
air
is
found
in
the
sinking
of
foundations
below
water
when
the
piers
of
a
bridge
or
other
structure
had
to
be
placed
in
a
deep
stream
the
old
method
was
to
drive
a
double
row
of
piles
round
the
place
and
fill
them
in
with
clay
forming
what
is
called
a
cofferdam
the
water
was
pumped
out
from
the
interior
and
the
foundation
laid
in
the
open
this
is
always
a
very
expensive
process
and
in
rapid
streams
is
scarcely
practicable
in
recent
times
large
bottomless
cases
called
caissons
have
been
used
with
tubes
attached
to
the
roof
by
which
air
can
be
forced
into
or
out
of
the
interior
these
caissons
are
brought
to
the
site
of
the
proposed
pier
and
are
there
sunk
where
the
bottom
is
loose
sandy
earth
the
vacuum
process
as
it
is
termed
is
often
employed
that
is
the
air
is
pumped
out
from
the
interior
and
the
superincumbent
pressure
then
causes
the
caisson
to
sink
and
the
earth
to
rise
within
it
but
it
is
more
usual
to
employ
what
is
called
the
plenum
process
in
which
air
under
high
pressure
is
pumped
into
the
caisson
and
expels
the
water
as
in
a
diving
bell
workmen
then
descend
entering
through
an
air
lock
and
excavate
the
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
caisson
which
sinks
gradually
as
the
excavation
continues
under
this
system
a
length
of
some
two
miles
of
quay
wall
is
being
constructed
at
antwerp
far
out
in
the
channel
of
the
river
scheldt
here
the
caissons
are
laid
end
to
end
with
each
other
along
the
whole
curve
of
the
wall
and
the
masonry
is
built
on
the
top
of
them
within
a
floating
cofferdam
of
very
ingenious
construction
there
are
few
mechanical
principles
more
widely
known
than
that
of
centrifugal
force
an
action
which
though
still
a
puzzle
to
students
has
long
been
thoroughly
understood
it
is
however
comparatively
recently
that
it
has
been
applied
in
practice
one
of
the
earliest
examples
was
perhaps
the
ordinary
governor
due
to
the
genius
of
watt
every
boy
knows
that
if
he
takes
a
weight
hanging
from
a
string
and
twirls
it
round
the
weight
will
rise
higher
and
revolve
in
a
larger
circle
as
he
increases
the
speed
watt
saw
that
if
he
attached
such
an
apparatus
to
his
steam
engine
the
balls
or
weights
would
tend
to
rise
higher
whenever
the
engine
begun
to
run
faster
that
this
action
might
be
made
partly
to
draw
over
the
valve
which
admitted
the
steam
and
that
in
this
way
the
supply
of
steam
would
be
lessened
and
the
speed
would
fall
few
ideas
in
science
have
received
so
wide
and
so
successful
an
application
as
this
but
of
late
years
another
property
of
centrifugal
force
has
been
brought
into
play
the
effect
of
this
force
is
that
any
body
revolving
in
a
circle
has
a
continual
tendency
to
fly
off
at
a
tangent
the
amount
of
this
tendency
depending
jointly
on
the
mass
of
the
body
and
on
the
velocity
of
the
rotation
it
is
the
former
of
these
conditions
which
is
now
taken
advantage
of
for
if
we
have
a
number
of
particles
all
revolving
with
the
same
velocity
but
of
different
specific
gravities
and
if
we
allow
them
to
follow
their
tendency
of
moving
off
at
a
tangent
it
is
evident
that
the
heaviest
particles
having
the
greatest
mass
will
move
with
the
greatest
energy
the
result
is
that
if
we
take
a
mass
of
such
particles
and
confine
them
within
a
circular
casing
we
shall
find
that
having
rotated
this
casing
with
a
high
velocity
and
for
a
sufficient
time
the
heaviest
particles
will
have
settled
at
the
outside
and
the
lightest
at
the
inside
while
between
the
two
there
will
be
a
gradation
from
the
one
to
the
other
here
then
we
have
the
means
of
separating
two
substances
solid
or
liquid
which
are
intimately
mixed
up
together
but
which
are
of
different
specific
gravities
this
physical
principle
has
been
taken
advantage
of
in
a
somewhat
homely
but
very
important
process
the
separation
of
cream
from
milk
in
this
arrangement
the
milk
is
charged
into
a
vessel
something
of
the
shape
and
size
of
a
gloucester
cheese
which
stands
on
a
vertical
spindle
and
is
made
to
rotate
with
a
velocity
as
high
as
revolutions
per
minute
at
this
enormous
speed
the
milk
which
is
the
heavier
flies
to
the
outside
while
the
cream
remains
behind
and
stands
up
as
a
thin
layer
on
the
inside
of
the
rotating
cylinder
of
fluid
so
completely
does
this
immense
speed
produce
in
the
liquid
the
characteristics
of
a
solid
that
if
the
rotating
shell
of
cream
be
touched
by
a
knife
it
emits
a
harsh
grating
sound
and
gives
the
sensation
experienced
in
attempting
to
cut
a
stone
the
separation
is
almost
immediately
complete
but
the
difficult
point
was
to
draw
off
the
two
liquids
separately
and
continuously
without
stopping
the
machine
this
has
been
simply
accomplished
by
taking
advantage
of
another
principle
of
hydromechanics
a
small
pipe
opening
just
inside
the
shell
of
the
cylinder
is
brought
back
to
near
the
center
where
it
rises
through
a
sort
of
neck
and
opens
into
an
exterior
casing
the
pressure
due
to
the
velocity
causes
the
skim
milk
to
rise
in
this
pipe
and
flow
continuously
out
at
the
inner
end
the
cream
is
at
the
same
time
drawn
off
by
a
similar
orifice
made
in
the
same
neck
and
leading
into
a
different
chamber
centrifugal
action
is
not
the
only
way
in
which
particles
of
different
specific
gravity
can
he
separated
from
each
other
by
motion
only
if
a
rapid
jigging
or
motion
be
given
to
a
mixture
of
such
particles
the
tendency
of
the
lighter
to
fly
further
under
the
action
of
the
impulse
causes
them
gradually
to
rise
to
the
upper
surface
this
surface
being
free
in
the
present
case
and
the
result
being
therefore
the
reverse
of
what
happens
in
the
rotating
chamber
if
such
a
mixture
be
examined
after
this
down
motion
has
gone
on
for
a
considerable
period
it
will
be
found
that
the
particles
are
arranged
pretty
accurately
in
layers
the
lightest
being
at
the
top
and
the
heaviest
at
the
bottom
this
principle
has
long
been
taken
advantage
of
in
such
cases
as
the
separation
of
lead
ores
from
the
matrix
in
which
they
are
embedded
the
rock
in
these
cases
is
crushed
into
small
fragments
and
placed
on
a
frame
having
a
rapid
when
the
heavy
lead
ore
gradually
collects
at
the
bottom
and
the
lighter
stone
on
the
top
to
separate
the
two
the
machine
must
be
stopped
and
cleared
by
hand
in
the
case
of
where
the
object
is
to
separate
fine
coal
from
the
particles
of
stone
mixed
with
it
this
process
would
be
very
costly
and
indeed
impossible
because
a
current
of
water
is
sweeping
through
the
whole
mass
in
the
case
of
the
coppee
the
desired
end
is
achieved
in
a
different
and
very
simple
manner
the
well
known
mineral
felspar
has
a
specific
gravity
intermediate
between
that
of
the
coal
and
the
shale
or
stone
with
which
it
is
found
intermixed
if
then
a
quantity
of
felspar
in
small
fragments
is
thrown
into
the
mixture
and
the
whole
then
submitted
to
the
jigging
process
the
result
will
be
that
the
stone
will
collect
on
the
top
and
the
coal
at
the
bottom
with
a
layer
of
felspar
separating
the
two
a
current
of
water
sweeps
through
the
whole
and
is
drawn
off
partly
at
the
top
carrying
with
it
the
stone
and
partly
at
the
bottom
carrying
with
it
the
fine
coal
the
above
are
instances
where
science
has
come
to
the
aid
of
engineering
here
is
one
in
which
the
obligation
is
reversed
the
rapid
stopping
of
railroad
trains
when
necessary
by
means
of
brakes
is
a
problem
which
has
long
occupied
the
attention
of
many
engineers
and
the
mechanical
solutions
offered
have
been
correspondingly
numerous
some
of
these
depend
on
the
action
of
steam
some
of
a
vacuum
some
of
compressed
air
some
of
others
again
ingeniously
utilize
the
momentum
of
the
wheels
themselves
but
for
a
long
time
no
effort
was
made
by
any
of
these
inventors
thoroughly
to
master
the
theoretical
conditions
of
the
problem
before
them
at
last
one
of
the
most
ingenious
and
successful
among
them
george
westinghouse
resolved
to
make
experiments
on
the
subject
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
associate
with
himself
capt
douglas
galton
their
experiments
carried
on
with
rare
energy
and
perseverance
and
at
great
expense
not
only
brought
into
the
clearest
light
the
physical
conditions
of
the
question
conditions
which
were
shown
to
be
in
strict
accordance
with
theory
but
also
disclosed
the
interesting
scientific
fact
that
the
friction
between
solid
bodies
at
high
velocities
is
not
constant
as
the
experiments
of
morin
had
been
supposed
to
imply
but
diminishes
rapidly
as
the
speed
increases
a
fact
which
other
observations
serve
to
confirm
the
old
scientific
principle
known
as
the
hydrostatic
paradox
according
to
which
a
pressure
applied
at
any
point
of
an
inclosed
mass
of
liquid
is
transmitted
unaltered
to
every
other
point
has
been
singularly
fruitful
in
practical
applications
bramah
was
perhaps
the
first
to
recognize
its
value
and
importance
he
applied
it
to
the
well
known
bramah
press
and
in
various
other
directions
some
of
which
were
less
successful
one
of
these
was
a
hydraulic
lift
which
bramah
proposed
to
construct
by
means
of
several
cylinders
sliding
within
each
other
after
the
manner
of
the
tubes
of
a
telescope
his
specification
of
this
invention
sufficiently
expresses
his
opinion
of
its
value
for
it
concludes
as
follows
this
patent
does
not
only
differ
in
its
nature
and
in
its
boundless
extent
of
claims
to
novelty
but
also
in
its
claims
to
merit
and
superior
utility
compared
with
any
other
patent
ever
brought
before
or
sanctioned
by
the
legislative
authority
of
any
nation
the
telescope
lift
has
not
come
into
practical
use
but
lifts
worked
on
the
hydraulic
principle
are
becoming
more
and
more
common
every
day
the
same
principle
has
been
applied
by
the
genius
of
sir
william
armstrong
and
others
to
the
working
of
cranes
and
other
machines
for
the
lifting
of
weights
etc
and
under
the
form
of
the
accumulator
with
its
distributing
pipes
and
hydraulic
engines
it
provides
a
store
of
power
always
ready
for
application
at
any
required
point
in
a
large
system
yet
costing
practically
nothing
when
not
actually
at
work
this
system
of
high
pressure
mains
worked
from
a
central
accumulator
has
been
for
some
years
in
existence
at
hull
as
a
means
of
supplying
power
commercially
for
all
the
purposes
needed
in
a
large
town
and
it
is
at
this
moment
being
carried
out
on
a
wider
scale
in
the
east
end
of
london
taking
advantage
of
this
system
and
combining
with
it
another
scientific
principle
of
wide
applicability
greathead
has
brought
out
an
instrument
called
the
injector
hydrant
which
seems
likely
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
extinguishing
of
fires
this
second
principle
is
that
of
the
lateral
induction
of
fluids
and
may
be
thus
expressed
in
the
words
of
the
late
william
froude
any
surface
which
in
passing
through
a
fluid
experiences
resistance
must
in
so
doing
impress
on
the
particles
which
resist
it
a
force
in
the
line
of
motion
equal
to
the
resistance
if
then
these
particles
are

it
will
result
that
they
will
follow
the
direction
of
the
moving
fluid
and
be
partly
carried
along
with
it
as
applied
in
the
injector

a
small
quantity
of
water
derived
from
the
high
pressure
mains
is
made
to
pass
from
one
pipe
into
another
coming
in
contact
at
the
same
time
with
a
reservoir
of
water
at
ordinary
pressure
the
result
is
that
the
water
from
the
reservoir
is
drawn
into
the
second
pipe
through
a
nozzle
and
may
be
made
to
issue
as
a

to
a
considerable
height
thus
the
small
quantity
of
which
if
used
by

perhaps

smaller

say
that
of
an
ordinary
house
the
above
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
instances
which
might
be
given
to
prove
the
general
truth
of
the
fact
with
which
we
started
namely
the
close
and
reciprocal
connection
between
physical
science
and
mechanical
engineering
taking
both
in
their
widest
sense
it
may
possibly
be
worth
while
to
return
again
to
the
subject
as
other
illustrations
arise
two
such
have
appeared
even
at
the
moment
of
writing
and
though
their
practical
success
is
not
yet
assured
it
may
be
worth
while
to
cite
them
the
first
is
an
application
of
the
old
principle
of
the
siphon
to
the
purifying
of
sewage
into
a
tank
containing
the
sewage
dips
a
siphon
pipe
some
thirty
feet
high
of
which
the
shorter
leg
is
many
times
larger
than
the
longer
when
this
is
started
the
water
rises
slowly
and
steadily
in
the
shorter
column
and
before
it
reaches
the
top
has
left
behind
it
all
or
almost
all
of
the
solid
particles
which
it
previously
held
in
suspension
these
fall
slowly
back
through
the
column
and
collect
at
the
bottom
of
the
tank
to
be
cleared
out
when
needful
the
effluent
water
is
not
of
course
chemically
pure
but
sufficiently
so
to
be
turned
into
any
ordinary
stream
the
second
invention
rests
on
a
curious
fact
in
chemistry
namely
that
caustic
soda
or
potash
will
absorb
steam
forming
a
compound
which
has
a
much
higher
temperature
than
the
steam
absorbed
if
therefore
be
discharged
into
the
bottom
of
a
vessel
containing
caustic
alkali
not
only
will
it
become
condensed
but
this
condensation
will
raise
the
temperature
of
the
mass
so
high
that
it
may
be
employed
in
the
generation
of
fresh
steam
it
is
needless
to
observe
how
important
will
be
the
bearing
of
this
invention
upon
the
working
of
steam
engines
for
many
purposes
if
only
it
can
be
established
as
a
practical
success
and
if
it
is
so
established
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
experience
thus
acquired
will
reveal
new
and
valuable
facts
with
regard
to
the
conditions
of
chemical
combination
and
absorption
in
the
elements
thus
brought

one
of

one
may
make
himself
a
proximate
idea
of
the
enormous
power
of
pressure
of
such
a
machine
if
he
can
imagine
what
a
strength
is
needed
to
bend
an
iron
plate
of
meters
thickness
in
cold
condition
being
also
meters
in
width
and
meters
in
length
and
weighing
about
kilogrammes
or
tons
the
bending
of
the
plates
is
done
as
follows
as
it
is
shown
in
the
illustration
connected
herewith
there
are
standing
well
secured
into
the
foundation
four
perpendicular
pillars
made
of
heavy
iron
all
of
which
are
holding
a
heavy
iron
block
which
by
means
of
female
nut
screws
is
lifted
and
lowered
in
a
perpendicular
direction
beneath
the
iron
block
between
the
pillars
is
lying
a
large
hollow
cylinder
in
which
the
press
piston
moves
up
and
down
in
a
perpendicular
direction
these
movements
are
caused
by
a
small
machine
or
better
press
pump
not
noticeable
in
the
illustration
which
presses
water
from
a
reservoir
through
a
narrow
pipe
into
the
large
hollow

preventing
at
the

the
escape
or

of
the
water
so
forced
in
the
hollow
cylinder
up
to
the
press

now
filled
with

remains
no
other
way
for
the
piston
as
to
move

to
undergo
the
bending

lying
between

preparations
are
already
made
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
iron
clad
plate
such
a
form
as
it
will
receive
through
the
bending
process
after
this
the
press
piston
will
with
the
greatest
force
steadily
but
slowly
move
upward
until
the
iron

plate
has
received
its
intended

we
show
them
the

which
each

starts
our

on
its
journey
around
the
world
a
machine
which
embodies
the
latest
and
greatest
progress
in
the
art
of

the
following

represents
one
of
the
three
fast
presses
which
the
house
of
hallberger
employs
in
the
printing
of
its
illustrated
journals
with
the
invention
of
the
cylinder
press
by
frederick
k√∂nig
was
verified
the
saying
that
the
art
of
printing
had
lent
wings
to
words
everywhere
the
primitive
had
to
make
way
for
the
steam
printing
machine
but
even
this
machine
since
its
advent
in
london
in
has
itself
undergone
so
many
changes
that
little
else
remains
of
k√∂nig
invention
than
the
principle
of
the
cylinder
the
demands
of
recent
times
for
still
more
rapid
machines
have
resulted
in
the
production
of
presses
printing
from
a
continuous
roll
or
web
of
paper
from
cylinders
revolving
in
one
given
direction
the
first
of
this
class
of
presses
the
bullock
press
was
built
in
america
then
england
followed
and
there
the
first
newspaper
to
make
use
of
one
was
the
the
augsburg
machine
works
were
the
first
to
supply
germany
with
them
and
it
was
this
establishment
which
first
undertook
to
apply
the
principle
of
the
web
perfecting
press
first
intended
for
newspaper
work
only
where
speed
rather
than
fine
work
is
the
object
sought
to
book
printing
in
which
far
greater
accuracy
and
excellence
is
required
and
the
result
has
been
the
construction
of
a
rotary
press
for
the
highest
grade
of
illustrated
periodical
publications
which
meets
all
the
requirements
with
the
most
complete
success
illustration
improved

the
building
of
rotary
presses
for
printing
illustrated

was
attempted
as
early
as
or
in
london
by
the
but
apparently
without
success
as
no
public
mention
has
ever
been
made
of
any
favorable
result
the
proprietor
of
the
illustrated
obtained
better
results
in
an
illustrated
penny
paper
an
outgrowth
of
his
great
journal
was
printed
upon
a
rotary
press
which
was
according
to
his
statement
constructed
by
a
machinist
named
middleton
the
first
one
however
did
not
at
all
meet
the
higher
demands
of
illustrated
periodical
printing
and
while
another
machine
constructed
on
the
same
principle
was
shown
in
the
paris
exposition
of
its
work
was
neither
in
quality
nor
quantity
adequate
to
the
needs
of
a
largely
circulated

paper
a
second
machine
also
on
exhibition
at
the
same
time
designed
and
built
by
the
celebrated
french
machinist
alauzet
could
not
be
said
to
have
attained
the
object
its
construction
was
undertaken
long
after
the
opening
of
the
exposition
and
too
late
to
solve
the
weighty
question
but
the
attempt
gave
promise
that
the
time
was
at
hand
when
a
press
could
be
built
which
could
print
our
illustrated
periodicals
more
rapidly
and
a
conference
with
the
proprietors
of
the
augsburg
machine
works
resulted
in
the
production
by
them
of
the
three
presses
from
which
land

illustrirte
are
issued
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
as
well
as
in
its
productions
the
press
is
the
marvel
of
mechanic
and
layman
as
seen
in
the
illustration
the
web
of
paper
leaves
the
roll
at
its
right
rising
to
a
point
at
the
top
where
it
passes
between
two
hollow
cylinders
covered
with
felt
and
filled
with
steam
which
serve
to
dampen
the
paper
as
may
be
necessary
the
small
seen
above
these
cylinders
regulating
the
supply
of
steam
after
leaving
these
cylinders
the
paper
descends
sloping
toward
the
right
and
passes
through
two
highly
polished
cylinders
for
the
purpose
of
recalendering
after
this
it
passes
under
the
lowest
of
the
three
large
cylinders
of
the
press
winds
itself
in
the
shape
of
an
s
toward
the
outside
and
over
the
middle
cylinder
and
leaves
the
press
in
an
almost
horizontal
line
after
having
been
printed
on
both
sides
and
is
then
cut
into
sheets
the
printing
is
done
while
the
paper
is
passing
around
the
two
white
cylinders
the
cylinder
carrying
the

is
placed

toward
the
center
of

part
of

the
second
form
is
placed
upon
the
uppermost
cylinder
and
is
the
outside

each
one
of
the

cylinders
requires
a
separate
inking
apparatus
that
of
the
upper
one
is
placed
to
the
right
at
the
top
and
the
bottom
one
is
also
at
the

inside
each
one
has
a
fountain
the
whole

of
the
press
in
which
the
ink
is
kept
and
connected
with
which
by
appropriate
mechanism
is
a
system
of
rollers
for
the
thorough
distribution
of
the
ink
and
depositing
it
upon
the
forms
the
rapidity
with
which
the
impressions
follow
each
other
does
not
allow
any
time
for
the
printing
on
the
first
side
to
dry
and
as
a
consequence
the
freshly
printed
sheet
coming
in
contact
with
the
packing
of
the
second
cylinder
would
so
soil
it
as
to
render
clean
printing
absolutely
impossible
to
avoid
this
a
second
roll
of
paper
is
introduced
into
the
machine
and
is
drawn
around
the
middle
cylinder
beneath
the
paper
which
has
already
been
printed
upon

side
and
receives
upon
its
surface
all
offset

keeping
perfectly
clean

article
appeared
in
a
recent
number
of
the
the
subject
of
the
cultivation
and
commercial
utilization
of
the
china
grass
plant
or
rhea
has
for
many
years
occupied
attention
the
question
being
one
of
national
importance
particularly
as
affecting
india
rhea
which
is
also
known
under
the
name
of
ramie
is
a
textile
plant
which
was
indigenous
to
china
and
india
it
is
perennial
easy
of
cultivation
and
produces
a
remarkably
strong
fiber
the
problem
of
its
cultivation
has
long
being
solved
for
within
certain
limits
rhea
can
be
grown
in
any
climate
india
and
the
british
colonies
offer
unusual
facilities
and
present
vast
and
appropriate
fields
for
that
enterprise
while
it
can
be
and
is
grown
in
most
european
countries
all
this
has
long
been
demonstrated
not
so
however
the
commercial
utilization
of
the
fiber
which
up
to
the
present
time
would
appear
to
be
a
problem
only
partially
solved
although
many
earnest
workers
have
been
engaged
in
the
attempted
solution
there
have
been
difficulties
in
the
way
of
decorticating
the
stems
of
this
plant
and
the
indian
government
in
offered
a
reward
of
for
the
best
machine
for
separating
the
fiber
from
the
stems
and
bark
of
rhea
in
its
green
or
freshly
cut
state
the
indian
government
was
led
to
this
step
by
the
strong
conviction
based
upon
ample
evidence
that
the
only
obstacle
to
the
development
of
an
extensive
trade
in
this
product
was
the
want
of
suitable
means
for
decorticating
the
plant
this
was
the
third
time
within
the
present
century
that
rhea
had
become
the
subject
of
official
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
the
first
effort
for
utilizing
the
plant
dating
from
when
roxburg
started
the
question
and
the
second
from
when
attention
was
again
directed
to
it
by
colonel
jenkins
the
offer
of
in
led
to
only
one
machine
being
submitted
for
trial
although
several
competitors
had
entered
their
names
this
machine
was
that
of
greig
of
edinburgh
but
after
careful
trial
by
general
then
lieutenant
colonel
hyde
it
was
found
that
it
did
not
fulfill
the
conditions
laid
down
by
the
government
and
therefore
the
full
prize
of
was
not
awarded
in
consideration
however
of
the
inventor
having
made
a
and
meritorious
attempt
to
solve
the
question
he
was
awarded
a
donation
of
other
unsuccessful
attempts
were
subsequently
made
and
eventually
the
offer
of
was
withdrawn
by
the
government
but
although
the
prize
was
withdrawn
invention
did
not
cease
and
the
government
in
reoffered
the
prize
of
another
competition
took
place
at
which
several
machines
were
tried
but
the
trials
as
before
proved
barren
of
any
practical
results
and
up
to
the
present
time
no
machine
has
been
found
capable
of
dealing
successfully
with
this
plant
in
the
green
state
the
question
of
the
preparation
of
the
fiber
however
continued
to
be
pursued
in
many
directions
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
strength
of
some
rhea
fiber
from
assam
experimented
with
in
by
forbes
royle
as
compared
with
petersburg
hemp
was
in
the
ratio
of
to
while
the
wild
rhea
from
assam
was
as
high
as
but
above
and
beyond
this
rhea
has
the
widest
range
of
possible
applications
of
any
fiber
as
shown
by
an
exhaustive
report
on
the
preparation
and
use
of
rhea
fiber
by
forbes
watson
published
in
at
which
date
watson
was
the
reporter
on
the
products
of
india
to
the
secretary
of
state
at
the
india
office
last
year
however
witnessed
the
solution
of
the
question
of
decortication
in
the
green
state
in
a
satisfactory
manner
by
favier
process
as
reported
by
us
at
the
time
this
process
consists
in
subjecting
the
plant
to
the
action
of
steam
for
a
period
varying
from
to
minutes
according
to
the
length
of
time
the
plant
had
been
cut
after
steaming
the
fiber
and
its
adjuncts
were
easily
stripped
from
the
wood
the
importance
and
value
of
this
invention
will
be
realized
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
plant
is
cultivated
at
long
distances
from
the
localities
where
the
fiber
is
prepared
for
the
market
the
consequence
is
that
for
every
hundredweight
of
fiber
about
a
ton
of
woody
material
has
to
be
transported
nor
is
this
the
only
evil
for
the
gummy
matter
in
which
the
fiber
is
embedded
becomes
dried
up
during
transport
and
the
separation
of
the
fiber
is
thus
rendered
difficult
and
even
impossible
inasmuch
as
some
of
the
fiber
is
left
adhering
to
the
wood
favier
process
greatly
simplifies
the
commercial
production
of
the
fiber
up
to
a
certain
point
for
at
a
very
small
cost
it
gives
the
manufacturer
the
whole
of
the
fiber
in
the
plant
treated
but
it
still
stops
short
of
what
is
required
in
that
it
delivers
the
fiber
in
ribbons
with
its
cementitious
matter
and
outer
skin
attached
to
remove
this
various
methods
have
been
tried
but
as
far
as
we
are
aware
without
general
success
that
is
to
say
the
fiber
can
not
always
be
obtained
of
such
a
uniformly
good
quality
as
to
constitute
a
commercially
reliable
article
such
was
the
position
of
the
question
when
about
a
year
ago
the
whole
case
was
submitted
to
the
distinguished
french
chemist
professor
fremy
member
of
the
institute
of
france
who
is
for
his
researches
into
the
nature
of
fibrous
plants
and
the
question
of
their
preparation
for
the
market
professor
fremy
thoroughly
investigated
the
matter
from
a
chemical
point
of
view
and
at
length
brought
it
to
a
successful
and
apparently
a
practical
issue
one
great
bar
to
previous
success
would
appear
to
have
been
the
absence
of
exact
knowledge
as
to
the
nature
of
the
constituents
of
that
portion
of
the
plant
which
contains
the
fiber
or
in
other
words
the
casing
or
bark
surrounding
the
woody
stem
of
the
rhea
as
determined
by
professor
fremy
this
consists
of
the
cutose
or
outer
skin
within
which
is
the
vasculose
containing
the
fiber
and
other
conjoined
matter
known
as
cellulose
between
which
and
the
woody
stem
is
the
pectose
or
gum
which
causes
the
skin
or
bark
as
a
whole
fiber
included
to
adhere
to
the
wood
the
professor
therefore
proceeded
to
carefully
investigate
the
nature
of
these
various
substances
and
in
the
result
he
found
that
the
vasculose
and
pectose
were
soluble
in
an
alkali
under
certain
conditions
and
that
the
cellulose
was
insoluble
he
therefore
dissolves
out
the
cutose
vasculose
and
pectose
by
a
very
simple
process
obtaining
the
fiber
clean
and
free
from
all
extraneous
adherent
matter
ready
for
the
spinner
in
order
however
to
insure
as
a
result
a
perfectly
uniform
and
marketable
article
the
professor
uses
various
chemicals
at
the
several
stages
of
the
process
these
however
are
not
administered
haphazard
or
by
rule
of
thumb
as
has
been
the
case
in
some
processes
bearing
in
the
same
direction
and
which
have
consequently
failed
in
the
sense
that
they
have
not
yet
taken
their
places
as
commercial
successes
the
professor
therefore
carefully
examines
the
article
which
he
has
to
treat
and
according
to
its
nature
and
the
character
of
its
components
he
determines
the
proportions
of
the
various
chemicals
which
he
introduces
at
the
several
stages
all
chance
of
failure
thus
appears
to
be
eliminated
and
the
production
of
a
fiber
of
uniform
and
reliable
quality
removed
from
the
region
of
doubt
into
that
of
certainty
the
two
processes
of
favier
and
fremy
have
therefore
been
combined
and
machinery
has
been
put
up
in
france
on
a
scale
sufficiently
large
to
fairly
approximate
to
practical
working
and
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
the
combined
inventions
the
experimental
works
are
situated
in
the
route
grand
montrouge
just
outside
paris
and
a
few
days
ago
a
series
of
demonstrations
were
given
there
by
brogden
and
of
london
the
trials
were
carried
out
by
albert
alroy
under
the
supervision
of
urbain
who
is
professor
fremy
chief
assistant
and
copatentee
and
were
attended
by
forbes
watson
collyer
taylor
late
member
of
the
general
assembly
new
zealand
barbe
favier
brogden
caspar
and
a
number
of
other
gentlemen
representing
those
interested
in
the
question
at
issue
the
process
as
carried
out
consists
in
first
treating
the
rhea
according
to
favier
invention
the
apparatus
employed
for
this
purpose
is
very
simple
and
inexpensive
consisting
merely
of
a
stout
deal
trough
or
box
about
long
wide
and
in
deep
the
box
has
a
hinged
lid
and
a
false
open
bottom
under
which
steam
is
admitted
by
a
perforated
pipe
there
being
an
outlet
for
the
condensed
water
at
one
end
of
the
box
into
this
box
the
bundles
of
rhea
were
placed
the
lid
closed
steam
turned
on
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
it
was
invariably
found
that
the
bark
had
been
sufficiently
softened
to
allow
of
its
being
readily
and
rapidly
stripped
off
by
hand
together
with
the
whole
of
the
fiber
in
what
may
be
called
ribbons
thus
the
process
of
decortication
is
effectively
accomplished
in
a
few
minutes
instead
of
requiring
as
it
sometimes
does
in
the
retting
process
days
and
even
weeks
and
being
at
the
best
attended
with
uncertainty
as
to
results
as
is
also
the
case
when
decortication
is
effected
by
machinery
moreover
the
retting
process
which
is
simply
steeping
the
cut
plants
in
water
is
a
delicate
operation
requiring
constant
watching
to
say
nothing
of
its
serious
inconvenience
from
a
sanitary
point
of
view
on
account
of
the
pestilential
emanations
from
the
retteries
decortication
by
steam
having
been
effected
the
work
of
favier
ceases
and
the
process
is
carried
forward
by
fremy
the
ribbons
having
been
produced
the
fiber
in
them
has
to
be
freed
from
the
mucilaginous
secretions
to
this
end
after
examination
in
the
laboratory
they
are
laid
on
metal
trays
which
are
placed
one
above
the
other
in
a
vertical
perforated
metal
cylinder
when
charged
this
cylinder
is
placed
within
a
strong
iron
cylinder
containing
a
known
quantity
of
water
to
which
an
alkali
is
added
in
certain
proportions
within
the
cylinder
is
a
steam
coil
for
heating
the
water
and
steam
having
been
turned
on
the
temperature
is
raised
to
a
certain
point
when
the
cylinder
is
closed
and
made
the
process
of
boiling
is
continued
under
pressure
until
the
temperature
and
consequently
the
steam
pressure
within
the
cylinder
has
attained
a
high
degree
on
the
completion
of
this
part
of
the
process
which
occupies
about
four
hours
and
upon
which
the
success
of
the
whole
mainly
depends
the
cementitious
matter
surrounding
the
fiber
is
found
to
have
been
transformed
into
a
substance
easily
dissolved
the
fibrous
mass
is
then
removed
to
a
centrifugal
machine
in
which
it
is
quickly
deprived
of
its
surplus
alkaline
moisture
and
it
is
then
placed
in
a
weak
solution
of
hydrochloric
acid
for
a
short
time
it
is
then
transferred
to
a
bath
of
pure
cold
water
in
which
it
remains
for
about
an
hour
and
it
is
subsequently
placed
for
a
short
time
in
a
weak
acid
bath
after
which
it
is
again
washed
in
cold
water
and
dried
for
the
market
such
are
the
processes
by
which
china
grass
may
become
a
source
of
profit
alike
to
the
cultivator
and
the
spinner
a
factory
situate
at
louviers
has
been
acquired
where
there
is
machinery
already
erected
for
preparing
the
fiber
according
to
the
processes
we
have
described
at
the
rate
of
one
ton
per
day
there
is
also
machinery
for
spinning
the
fiber
into
yarns
these
works
were
also
visited
by
those
gentlemen
who
were
at
the
experimental
works
at
montrouge
and
who
also
visited
the
government
laboratory
in
paris
of
which
professor
fremy
is
chief
and
urbain
and
where
those
gentlemen
explained
the
details
of
their
process
and
made
their
visitors
familiar
with
the
progressive
steps
of
their
investigations
with
regard
to
the
rhea
treated
at
montrouge
we
may
observe
that
it
was
grown
at
la
reolle
near
bordeaux
some
special
experiments
were
also
carried
out
by
forbes
watson
with
some
rhea
grown
by
the
duke
of
wellington
at
his
grace
having
taken
an
active
interest
in
the
question
for
some
years
past
in
all
cases
the
rhea
was
used
green
and
comparatively
freshly
cut
one
of
the
objects
of
experiments
was
by
treating
rhea
cut
at
certain
stages
of
growth
to
ascertain
at
which
stage
the
plant
yields
the
best
fiber
and
consequently
how
many
crops
can
be
raised
in
the
year
with
the
best
advantage
this
question
has
often
presented
itself
as
one
of
the
points
to
be
determined
and
advantage
has
been
taken
of
the
present
opportunity
with
a
view
to
the
solution
of
the
question
taylor
also
took
with
him
a
sample
of
new
zealand
flax
which
was
successfully
treated
by
the
process
on
the
whole
the
conclusion
is
that
the
results
of
the
combined
processes
so
far
as
they
have
gone
are
eminently
satisfactory
and
justify
the
expectation
that
a
large
enterprise
in
the
cultivation
and
utilization
of
china
grass
is
on
the
eve
of
being

in
many
industries
there
are
operations
that
have
to
be
repeated
at
regular
intervals
and
for
this
reason
the
construction
of
an
apparatus
for
giving
a
signal
not
only
at
the
hour
fixed
but
also
at
equal
intervals
is
a
matter
of
interest
the
question
of
doing
this
has
been
solved
in
a
very
elegant
way
by

the
invention
of

crenata

from

are
quick
growing
handsome
trees
with
smooth
bark
not
unlike
that
of
beech

hornbeam
it
is
only
when
the
trees
are
old
that
the
bark
is
cast
off
in
rather
large
sized
plates
as
is
the
case
with
the

the
habit
of
both

somewhat
peculiar
in

is
a
decided
tendency
for
all

main
branches
to
be
given
off

not

for
instance
do
those

each
forms
an
acute
angle
with
the
center
of
the

the
trunks
are
more
columnar
than
those
of
almost
all
other
hardy

their
distinct
and
graceful
habit
renders
them
wonderfully
well
adapted

highly

in

is
fully
corroborated
by
mirbel

desfontaine
on
whom
devolved
the
duty
of
reporting
on
this
memoir
they
say
that
it
attains
a
size
equal
to
that
of
the
largest
trees
of
french
forests
and
recommend
its
being
largely
planted
they
particularly
mention
its
suitability
for
roadside
avenues
and
affirm
that
its
leaves
are
never
devoured
by
caterpillars
and
that
the
stems
are
not
subject
to
the
canker

frequently
ruins

the
name
orme
de

which
is

cook
the
eminent
apiarist
calls
attention
to
a
new
pest
which
has
made
its
appearance
in
many
apiaries
after
referring
to
the
fact
that
poultry
and
all
other
domestic
animals
of
ten
suffer
serious
injury
from
the
attacks
of
parasitic
mites
and
that
even
such
household
stores
as
sugar
flour
and
cheese
are
not
from
their
ravages
he
tells
of
the
discovery
of
a
parasitic
pest
among
bees
he
says
during
the
last
spring
a
lady
of
connecticut
discovered
these
mites
in
her
hives
while
investigating
to
learn
the
cause
of
their
rapid
depletion
she
had
noticed
that
the
colonies
were
greatly
reduced
in
number
of
bees
and
upon
close
observation
found
that
the
diseased
or
failing
colonies
were
covered
with
the
mites
so
small
are
these
pests
that
a
score
of
them
can
take
possession
of
a
single
bee
and
not
be
crowded
for
room
either
the
lady
states
that
the
bees
roll
and
scratch
in
their
vain
attempts
to
rid
themselves
of
these
annoying
and
finally
worried
out
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
hive
or
go
forth
to
die
on
the
outside
mites
are
not
true
insects
but
are
the
most
degraded
of
spiders
the

at
once
recognized
by
their
eight
legs
the
order
of

which
includes
the

quickly
told
from

higher

and
scorpions
by

rounded
bodies
which

with
little
appearance
of
segmentation
and
their
small
obscure
heads
the
mites
alone
of
all
the
pass
through
a
marked
metamorphosis
thus
the
young
mite
has
only
six
legs
while
the
mature
form
has
eight
the
bee
mite
is
very
small
not
more
than
of
an
inch
long
the
female
is
slightly
longer
than
the
male
and
somewhat
transparent
the
color
is
black
though
the
legs
and
more
transparent
areas
of
the

appear
yellowish
all
the
legs
are
fine
jointed
slightly
hairy
and
each
tipped

two
hooks

claws
as
to
remedies
the
professor
says
that
as
what
would
kill
the
mites
would
doubtless
kill
the
bees
makes
the
question
a
difficult
one
he
suggests
however
the
frequent
changing
of
the
bees
from
one
hive
to
another
after
which
the
emptied
hives
should
be
thoroughly
scalded

with
the

i
have
handled
honey
as
an
apiarist
and
dealer
for
ten
years
and
find
by
actual
experience
that
it
has
no
tendency
to
crystallize
in
warm
weather
but
on
the
contrary
it
will
crystallize
in
cold
weather
and
the
colder
the
weather
the
harder
the
honey
will
get
i
have
had
colonies
of
bees
starve
when
there
was
plenty
of
honey
in
the
hives
it
was
in
extreme
cold
weather
there
was
not
enough
animal
heat
in
the
bees
to
keep
the
honey
from
solidifying
hence
the
starvation
of
the
colonies
i
removed
with
a
thin
paddle
sixty
pounds
of
honey
from
a
large

jar
where
it
had
remained
over
one
year
last

i
broke
a

heavy
knife
in

treated
it

bringing

it

i
never
had

and
the

of

in

the
adding
of

to
be
entirely
superfluous

october
an
extensive
sheep
range
the
little
schooner
santa
rosa
arrived
in
port
from
santa
barbara
a
few
days
ago
she
comes
up
to
this
city
twice
a
year
to
secure
provisions
clothing
lumber
for
use
on
santa
rosa
island
being
owned
by
the
great
sheep
raiser
moore
who
owns
the
island
and
the
sheep
that
exist
upon
it
the
island
is
about
miles
south
of
santa
barbara
and
is
miles
in
length
and
in
breadth
and
contains
about
acres
of
land
which
are
admirably
adapted
to
sheep
raising
last
june
moore
clipped
sacks
of
wool
from
these
sheep
each
sack
containing
an
average
of
pounds
of
wool
making
a
total
of
pounds
which
he
sold
at
cents
a
pound
bringing
him
in
or
a
clear
profit
of
over
this
is
said
to
be
a
low
yield
so
it
is
evident
that
sheep
raising
there
when
taking
into
consideration
that
shearing
takes
place
twice
a
year
and
that
a
profit
is
made
off
the
sale
of
mutton
is
very
profitable
the
island
is
divided
into
four
quarters
by
fences
running
clear
across
at
right
angles
and
the
sheep
do
not
have
to
be
herded
like
those
ranging
about
the
foothills
four
men
are
employed
regularly
the
year
round
to
keep
the
ranch
in
order
and
to
look
after
the
sheep
and
during
the
shearing
time
fifty
or
more
shearers
are
employed
these
men
secure
forty
or
fifty
work
and
the
average
number
of
sheep
sheared
in
a
day
is
about
ninety
for
which
five
cents
a
clip
is
paid
thus
a
day
being
made
by
each
man
or
something
over
for
the
season
or
over
for
ninety
days
out
of
the
year
although
the
shearing
of
ninety
sheep
in
a
day
is
the
average
a
great
many
will
go
as
high
as
and
one
man
has
been
known
to
shear
of
course
every
man
tries
to
shear
as
many
as
he
can
and
owing
to
haste
frequently
the
animals
are
severely
cut
by
the
sharp
shears
if
the
wound
is
serious
the
sheep
immediately
has
its
throat
cut
and
is
turned
into
mutton
and
disposed
of
to
the
butchers
and
the
shearer
if
in
the
habit
of
frequently
inflicting
such
wounds
is
discharged
in
the
shearing
of
these
sheep
a
hundred
or
more
are
injured
to
such
an
extent
as
to
necessitate
their
being
killed
but
the
wool
and
meat
are
of
course
turned
into
profit
although
no
herding
is
necessary
about
or
more
trained
goats
are
kept
on
the
island
continually
which
to
all
intents
and
purposes
take
the
place
of
the
shepherd
dogs
so
necessary
in
mountainous
districts
where
sheep
are
raised
whenever
the
animals
are
removed
from

quarter
to
another
the
man
in
charge
takes
out
with
him
several
of
the
goats
exclaims
in
spanish
cheva
meaning
sheep
the
goat
through
its
training
understands
what
is
wanted
and
immediately
runs
to
the
band
and
the
sheep
accept
it
as
their
leader
following
wherever
it
goes
the
goat
in
turn
follows
the
man
to
whatever
point
he
wishes
to
take
the
band
to
prevent
the
sheep
from
contracting
disease
it
is
necessary
to
give
them
a
washing
twice
a
year
moore
having
so
many
on
hand
found
it
necessary
to
invent
some
way
to
accomplish
this
whereby
not
so
much
expense
would
be
incurred
and
time
wasted
after
experimenting
for
some
time
he
had
a
ditch
dug
feet
in
depth
a
little
over
foot
in
width
and
feet
long
in
this
he
put
gallons
of
water
pounds
of
sulphur
pounds
of
lime
and
pounds
of
soda
all
of
which
is
heated
to
the
goats
lead
the
sheep
into
a
corral
or
trap
at
one
end
and
the
animals
are
compelled
to
swim
through
to
the
further
end
thus
securing
a
bath
and
taking
their
medicine
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
owner
of
the

moore
a
few
years

purchased

and
soon
starts
for

where
he
will
settle
down
for

rest
of

he
still
retains
an
interest
in
the
santa

which
is
about

this

contains
about
acres

london
robert
lee
recently
delivered
a
lecture
on
the
above
subject
illustrated
by
experiments
the
author
remarked
that
he
could
not
better
open
up
his
theme
than
by
explaining
what
was
meant
by
disinfection
he
would
do
so
by
an
illustration
from
greek
literature
when
achilles
had
slain
hector
the
body
still
lay
on
the
plain
of
troy
for
twelve
days
after
the
god
hermes
found
it
there
and
went
and
told
of
it
this
the
twelfth
evening
since
he
rested
untouched
by
worms
untainted
by
the
air
the
greek
word
for
taint
in
this
sense
was
which
meant
putrefaction
and
from
this
we
had
the
term
antiseptic
or
that
which
was
opposed
to
or
prevented
putrefaction
the
lecturer
continued
i
have
here
in
a
test
tube
some
water
in
which
a
small
piece
of
meat
was
placed
a
few
days
ago
the
test
tube
has
been
in
rather
a
warm
room
and
the
meat
has
begun
to
decompose
what
has
here
taken
place
is
the
first
step
in
this
inquiry
this
has
been
the
question
at
which
scientific
men
have
been
working
and
from
the
study
of
which
has
come
a
valuable
addition
to
surgical
knowledge
associated
with
the
name
of
professor
lister
and
known
as
antiseptic
what
happens
to
this
meat
and
what
is
going
on
in
the
water
which
surrounds
it
how
long
will
it
be
before
all
the
smell
of
putrefaction
has
gone
and
the
water
is
clear
again
for
it
does
in
time
become
clear
and
instead
of
the
meat
we
find
a
fine
powdery
substance
at
the
bottom
of
the
test
tube
it
may
take
weeks
before
this
process
is
completed
depending
on
the
rate
at
which
it
goes
on
now
if
we
take
a
drop
of
this
water
and
examine
it
with
the
microscope
we
find
that
it
contains
vast
numbers
of
very
small
living
creatures
or
organisms
they
belong
to
the
lowest
forms
of
life
and
are
of
very
simple
shape
either
very
delicate
narrow
threads
or
rods
or
globular
bodies
the
former
are
called
bacteria
or
bodies
the
latter
micrococci
they
live
upon
the
meat
and
only
disappear
when
the
meat
is
consumed
then
as
they
die
and
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
test
tube
the
water
clears
again
supposing
now
when
the
meat
is
first
put
into
water
the
water
is
made
to
boil
and
while
boiling
a
piece
of
cotton
wool
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
tube
the
tube
may
be
kept
in
the
same
room
at
the
same
temperature
as
the
unboiled
one
but
no
signs
of
decomposition
will
be
found
however
long
we
keep
it
the
cotton
wool
prevents
it
for
we
may
boil
the
water
with
the
meat
in
it
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
bacteria
and
micrococci
are
present
if
the
wool
is
not
put
in
the
mouth
of
the
test
tube
the
conclusion
you
would
naturally
draw
from
this
simple
but
very
important
experiment
is
that
the
wool
must
have
some
effect
upon
the
air
for
we
know
well
that
if
we
keep
the
air
out
we
can
preserve
meat
from
decomposing
that
is
the
principle
upon
which
preserved
meats
and
fruits
are
prepared
we
should
at
once
conclude
that
the
bacteria
and
micrococci
must
exist
in
the
air
perhaps
not
in
the
state
in
which
we
find
them
in
the
water
but
that
their
germs
or
eggs
are
floating
in
the
atmosphere
how
full
the
air
may
be
of
these
germs
was
first
shown
by
professor
tyndall
when
he
sent
a
ray
of
electric
light
through
a
dark
chamber
and
as
if
by
a
magician
wand
revealed
the
multitudinous
atomic
beings
which
people
the
air
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
contemplate
how
one
branch
of
scientific
knowledge
may
assist
another
and
we
would
hardly
have
imagined
that
the
beam
of
the
electric
light
could
thus
have
been
brought
in
to
illumine
the
path
of
the
surgeon
for
it
is
on
the
exclusion
of
these
bacteria
that
it
is
found
the
success
of
some
great
operation
may
depend
it
is
thus
easy
to
understand
how
great
an
importance
is
to
be
attached
to
the
purity
of
air
in
which
we
live
this
is
the
practical
use
of
the
researches
to
which
the
art
of
surgery
is
so
much
indebted
and
not
surgery
alone
but
all
mankind
in
greater
or
less
degree
professor
tyndall
has
gone
further
than
this
and
has
shown
us
that
on
the
tops
of
lofty
mountains
the
air
is
so
pure
so
free
from
organisms
that
decomposition
is
impossible
now
supposing
we
make
another
experiment
with
the
test
tube
and
instead
of
boiling
we
add
to
its
contents
a
few
drops
of
carbolic
acid
we
find
that
decomposition
is
prevented
almost
as
effectually
as
by
the
use
of
the
cotton
wool
there
are
many
other
substances
which
act
like
carbolic
acid
and
they
are
known
by
the
common
name
of
antiseptics
or
antiseptic
agents
they
all
act
in
the
same
way
and
in
such
cases
as
the
dressing
of
wounds
it
is
more
easy
to
use
this
method
of
excluding
bacteria
than
by
the
exclusion
of
the
air
or
by
the
use
of
cotton
wool
we
have
here
another
object
for
inquiry
the
particular
property
of
these
different
antiseptics
the
property
which
they
possess
of
preventing
decomposition
this
knowledge
is
ancient
indeed
we
have
the
best
evidence
in
the
skill
of
the
egyptians
in
embalming
the
dead
these
substances
are
obtained
from
wood
or
coal
which
once
was
wood
those
woods
which
do
not
contain
some
antiseptic
substance
such
as
a
gum
or
a
resin
will
rot
and
decay
i
am
not
sure
that
we
can
give
a
satisfactory
reason
for
this
but
it
is
certain
that
all
these
substances
act
as
antiseptics
by
destroying
the
living
organisms
which
are
the
cause
of
putrefaction
some
are
fragrant
oils
as
for
example
clove
santal
and
thyme
others
are
fragrant
gums
such
as
gum
bezoin
and
myrrh
a
large
class
are
the
various
kinds
of
turpentine
obtained
from
pine
trees
we
obtain
carbolic
acid
from
the
coal
tar
largely
produced
in
the
manufacture
of
gas
both
wood
tar
well
known
under
the
name
of
creosote
and
coal
tar
are
powerful
antiseptics
it
is
easy
to
understand
by
what
means
meat
and
fish
are
preserved
from
decomposition
when
they
have
been
kept
in
the
smoke
of
a
wood
fire
the
smoke
contains
creosote
in
the
form
of
vapor
and
the
same
effect
is
produced
on
the
meat
or
fish
by
the
smoke
as
if
they
had
been
dipped
in
a
solution
of
tar
with
this
difference
that
they
are
dried
by
the
smoke
whereas
moisture
favors
decomposition
very
greatly
i
can
show
why
a
fire
from
which
there
is
much
smoke
is
better
than
one
which
burns
with
a
clear
flame
by
a
simple
experiment
here
is
a
piece
of
gum
benzoin
the
substance
from
which
friar
balsam
is
made
this
will
burn
if
we
light
it
just
as
tar
burns
and
without
much
smoke
or
smell
if
instead
of
burning
it
we
put
some
on
a
spoon
and
heat
it
gently
much
more
smoke
is
produced
and
a
fragrant
scent
is
given
off
in
the
same
way
we
can
burn
spirit
of
lavender
or
eau
de
cologne
but
we
get
no
scent
from
them
in
this
way
for
the
burning
destroys
the
scent
this
is
a
very
important
fact
in
the
disinfection
of
the
air
the
less
the
flame
and
the
larger
the
quantity
of
smoke
the
greater
the
effect
produced
so
far
as
disinfection
is
concerned
as
air
is
a
vapor
we
must
use
our
disinfectants
in
the
form
of
vapor
so
that
the
one
may
mix
with
the
other
just
as
when
we
are
dealing
with
fluids
we
must
use
a
fluid
disinfectant
the
question
that
presents
itself
is
this
can
we
so
diffuse
the
vapor
of
an
antiseptic
like
carbolic
acid
through
the
air
as
to
destroy
the
germs
which
are
floating
in
it
and
thus
purify
it
making
it
like
air
which
has
been
filtered
through
wool
or
like
that
on
the
top
of
a
lofty
mountain
if
the
smoke
of
a
wood
fire
seems
to
act
as
an
antiseptic
and
putrefaction
is
prevented
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
that
air
could
be
purified
and
made
antiseptic
by
some
proper
and
convenient
arrangement
let
us
endeavor
to
test
this
by
a
few
experiments
here
is
a
large
tube
inches
across
and
feet
long
fixed
just
above
a
small
tin
vessel
in
which
we
can
boil
water
and
keep
it
boiling
as
long
as
we
please
if
we
fill
the
vessel
with
carbolic
acid
and
water
and
boil
it
very
gently
the
steam
which
rises
will
ascend
and
fill
the
tube
with
a
vapor
which
is
strong
or
weak
in
carbolic
acid
according
as
we
put
more
or
less
acid
in
the
water
that
is
to
say
we
have
practically
a
chimney
containing
an
antiseptic
vapor
very
much
the
same
thing
as
the
smoke
of
a
wood
fire
we
must
be
able
to
keep
the
water
boiling
for
the
experiment
may
have
to
be
continued
during
several
days
and
during
this
time
must
be
neither
stronger
nor
weaker
in
carbolic
acid
neither
warmer
nor
colder
than
a
certain
temperature
this
chimney
must
be
always
at
the
same
heat
and
the
fire
must
therefore
be
kept
constantly
burning
this
is
easily
accomplished
by
means
of
a
jet
of
gas
and
by
refilling
the
vessel
every
hours
with
the
same
proportions
of
carbolic
acid
and
water
the
question
arises
how
strong
must
this
vapor
be
in
carbolic
acid
to
act
as
an
antiseptic
it
is
found
that
part
acid
to
of
water
is
quite
sufficient
to
prevent
putrefaction
if
we
keep
this
just
below
boiling
point
there
will
be
a
gentle
and
constant
rising
of
steam
into
the
cylinder
and
we
can
examine
this
vapor
to
see
if
it
is
antiseptic
we
will
take
two
test
tubes
half
filled
with
water
and
put
a
small
piece
of
beef
into
each
of
them
and
boil
each
for
half
a
minute
one
test
tube
we
will
hang
up
inside
the
cylinder
so
that
it
is
surrounded
by
carbolic
acid
vapor
the
other
we
stand
up
in
the
air
if
the
latter
is
hung
in
a
warm
room
decomposition
will
soon
take
place
in
it
will
the
same
thing
happen
to
the
other
cylinder
for
convenience
sake
we
had
best
put
six
tubes
inside
the
cylinder
so
that
we
can
take
one
out
every
day
for
a
week
and
examine
the
contents
on
the
field
of
a
microscope
it
will
be
necessary
to
be
very
particular
as
to
the
temperature
to
which
the
tubes
are
exposed
and
the
rates
of
evaporation
beneath
the
cylinder
i
may
mention
that
on
some
of
the
hottest
days
of
last
summer
i
made
some
experiments
when
the
temperature
both
of
the
laboratory
and
inside
the
cylinder
was
i
used
test
tubes
containing
boiled
potatoes
instead
of
meat
and
found
that
the
tube
in
the
air
after
hours
abounded
not
simply
with
bacteria
and
other
small
bodies
present
in
decomposition
but
with
the
large
and
varied
forms
of
protozoa
while
the
tube
inside
the
cylinder
contained
no
signs
of
decomposition
whatever
when
the
room
was
cold
the
experiments
were
not
so
satisfactory
because
in
the
former
case
there
was
very
little
if
any
current
of
air
in
the
cylinder
this
leads
us
to
the
question
why
should
we
not
make
the
solution
of
carbolic
acid
and
water
and
heat
it
letting
the
steam
escape
by
a
small
hole
so
as
to
produce
a
jet
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
for
all
practical
purposes
such
a
steam
jet
will
contain
the
same
proportion
of
acid
to
water
as
did
the
original
solution
the
solution
can
of
course
be
made
stronger
or
weaker
till
we
ascertain
the
exact
proportion
which
will
prevent
decomposition
from
this
arises
naturally
the
question
what
quantity
of
vapor
must
be
produced
in
a
room
in
order
to
kill
the
bacteria
in
its
atmosphere
if
we
know
the
size
of
the
room
shall
we
be
able
tell
these
questions
have
not
yet
been
answered
but
the
experiments
which
will
settle
them
will
be
soon
made
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
have
indicated
the
lines
upon
which
they
will
be
made
i
have
here
a
boiler
of
copper
into
which
we
can
put
a
mixture
and
can
get
from
it
a
small
jet
of
steam
for
some
hours
a
simple
experiment
will
show
that
no
bacteria
will
exist
in
that
vapor
if
i
take
a
test
tube
containing
meat
and
boil
it
while
holding
the
mouth
of
it
in
this
vapor
after
it
has
cooled
we
close
the
mouth
with
cotton
wool
and
set
it
aside
in
a
warm
place
after
some
days
we
shall
find
no
trace
of
decomposition
but
if
the
experiment
is
repeated
with
water
decomposition
will
soon
show
itself
of
course
any
strength
of
carbolic
acid
can
be
used
at
will
and
will
afford
a
series
of
tests
there
are
other
methods
of
disinfecting
the
atmosphere
which
we
can
not
consider
this
evening
such
as
the
very
potent
one
of
burning
sulphur
in
conclusion
the
lecturer
remarked
that
his
lecture
had
been
cast
into
a
suggestive
form
so
as
to
set
his
audience
thinking
over
the
causes
which
make
the
air
impure
and
how
these
impurities
are
to
be
prevented
from
becoming
deleterious
to
health
a
new
method
of
staining
bacillus
tuberculosis
by
burrill
champaign
having
had
considerable
experience
in
the
use
of
the
alcoholic
solutions
of
aniline
dyes
for
staining
bacteria
and
having
for
some
months
used
solutions
in
glycerine
instead
i
have
come
to
much
prefer
the
latter
evaporation
of
the
solvent
is
avoided
and
in
consequence
a
freedom
from
vexatious
precipitations
is
secured
and
more
uniform
and
reliable
results
are
obtained
there
is
moreover
with
the
alcoholic
mixtures
a
tendency
to
creep
or
run
by
which
one
is
liable
to
have
stained
more
than
he
wishes
fingers
instruments
table
etc
from
these
things
the
glycerine
mixtures
are
practically
free
and
there
are
no
compensating
drawbacks
for
staining
the
following
is
confidently
commended
as
preferable
to
the
materials
and
methods
heretofore
in
use
take
glycerine
parts
fuchsin
parts
aniline
oil
parts
carbolic
acid
parts
the
solution
is
readily
and
speedily
effected
with
no
danger
of
precipitation
and
can
be
kept
in
stock
without
risk
of
deterioration
when
wanted
for
use
put
about
two
drops
into
a
watch
glass
a
small
pomatum
pot
is
better
full
of
water
and
gently
shake
or
stir
just
here
there
is
some
danger
of
precipitating
the
coloring
matter
but
the
difficulty
is
easily
avoided
by
gentle
instead
of
vigorous
stirring
after
the
stain
is
once
dissolved
in
the
water
no
further
trouble
occurs
if
any
evaporation
takes
place
by
being
left
too
long
it
is
the
water
that
goes
not
the
main
solvent
the
color
should
now
be
a
light
translucent
red
much
too
diffuse
for
writing
ink
put
in
the
smeared
cover
glass
after
passing
it
a
few
times
through
a
flame
and
leave
it
at
the
ordinary
temperature
of
a
comfortable
room
half
an
hour
if
however
quicker
results
are
desired
boil
a
little
water
in
a
test
tube
and
put
in
about
double
the
above
indicated
amount
of
the
glycerine
mixture
letting
it
run
down
the
side
of
the
tube
gently
shake
until
absorbed
and
pour
out
the
hot
liquid
into
a
convenient
dish
and
at
once
put
in
the
cover
with
sputum
without
further
attention
to
the
temperature
the
stain
will
be
effected
within
two
minutes
but
the
result
is
not
quite
so
good
especially
for
permanent
mounts
as
by
the
slower
process
after
staining
put
the
cover
into
nitric
or
hydrochloric
acid
and
water
one
part
to
four
until
decolorized
say
one
minute
wash
in
water
and
examine
or
dry
and
mount
in
balsam
if
it
is
desired
to
color
the
ground
material
which
is
not
necessary
put
on
the
decolorized
and
washed
glass
a
drop
of
aniline
blue
in
glycerine
after
one
minute
wash
again
in
water
and
proceed
as
before
almost
any
objective
from
inch
up
will
show
the
bacilli
if
sufficient
attention
is
paid
to
the
cure
for
hemorrhoids
the
carbolic
acid
treatment
of
hemorrhoids
is
now
receiving
considerable
attention
hence
the
reprint
from
the
medical
november
of
an
article
on
the
subject
by
george
fundenberg
is
both
timely
and
interesting
after
relating
six
cases
the
author
says
it
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
to
increase
this
list
of
cases
the
large
number
i
have
on
record
all
prove
that
this
treatment
is
safe
and
effectual
i
believe
that
the
great
majority
of
cases
can
be
cured
in
this
manner
whoever
doubts
this
should
give
the
method
a
fair
trial
for
it
is
only

who
have
done
so
that
