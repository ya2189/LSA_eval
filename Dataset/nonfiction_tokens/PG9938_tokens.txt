preface
this
volume
the
fourth
of
the
woman
institute
library
of
cookery
deals
with
salads
sandwiches
cold
desserts
cakes
both
large
and
small
puddings
pastry
and
pies
such
foods
constitute
some
of
the
niceties
of
the
diet
but
skill
in
their
preparation
signifies
at
once
a
housewife
mastery
of
the
science
of
cookery
in
and
are
presented
so
simply
the
secrets
of
appetizing
salads
that
they
can
be
grasped
by
even
a
novice
and
sandwiches
of
numerous
varieties
from
those
appropriate
for
afternoon
teas
to
those
suitable
for
the
main
dish
in
the
meal
are
so
treated
that
they
appear
to
rise
above
the
ordinary
place
usually
accorded
them
one
need
never
hesitate
to
prepare
a
menu
for
an
afternoon
or
evening
social
affair
or
the
salad
course
in
a
luncheon
or
dinner
after
a
study
of
this
part
of
the
volume
a
glance
through
and
frozen
will
convince
one
very
quickly
that
a
large
number
of
the
desserts
that
complete
our
meals
are
served
cold
the
mere
mention
of
custards
gelatine
desserts
and
such
frozen
mixtures
as
ice
creams
ices
frappés
sherbets
mousses
parfaits
and
biscuits
all
of
which
are
explained
here
is
sufficient
to
indicate
that
this
is
an
extremely
delightful
part
of
the
subject
of
cookery
entertaining
takes
on
a
new
and
simplified
meaning
when
one
knows
how
to
make
and
serve
such
dishes
to
be
able
to
make
cakes
and
puddings
well
is
one
of
the
ambitions
of
the
modern
housewife
and
she
has
an
opportunity
to
realize
it
in
a
study
of
cookies
and
parts
and
sweet
food
in
excess
is
undesirable
but
in
a
moderate
quantity
it
is
required
in
each
person
diet
and
may
be
obtained
in
this
form
without
harm
if
it
is
properly
prepared
the
two
classes
of
cakes
butter
and
sponge
are
treated
in
detail
both
as
to
the
methods
of
making
and
the
required
ingredients
and
numerous
recipes
are
given
which
will
enable
the
housewife
to
provide
both
plain
and
fancy
cakes
for
ordinary
and
special
occasions
puddings
that
are
prepared
by
boiling
steaming
and
baking
and
the
sauces
that
make
them
appetizing
receive
a
goodly
share
of
attention
and
completes
this
volume
rounding
out
as
it
were
the
housewife
understanding
of
dessert
making
to
many
persons
pastry
making
is
an
intricate
matter
but
with
the
principles
thoroughly
explained
and
each
step
clearly
illustrated
delicious
pies
of
every
variety
as
well
as
dainties
may
be

with
very
little
effort
upon
the
completion
of
a
study
of
this
volume
the
housewife
will
find
herself
equipped
with
a
knowledge
of
the
way
to
prepare
many
delicacies
for
her
meals
while
these
are
probably
not
so
important

the
diet

the
more

salads
salads
in
the
diet
so
much
variety
exists
among
salads
that
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
give
a
comprehensive
definition
of
this
class
of
foods
in
general
however
salads
may
be
considered
as
a
dish
of
green
herbs
or
vegetables
sometimes
cooked
and
usually
chopped
or
sliced
sometimes
mixed
with
fruit
or
with
cooked
and
chopped
cold
meat
fish
and
generally
served
with
a
dressing
for
the
most
part
salads
take
their
name
from
their
chief
ingredient
as
for
instance
chicken
salad
tomato
salad
pineapple
salad
etc
just
what
place
salads
have
in
the
meal
depends
on
the
salad
itself
a
salad
such
as
lobster
salad
should
take
the
place
of
the
meat
course
whereas
a
light
salad
of
vegetables
or
fruits
may
be
used
as
an
additional
course
importance
of
salads
salads
are
often
considered
to
be
a
dish
of
little
importance
that
is
something
that
may
be
left
out
or
added
to
a
meal
without
affecting
it
to
any
great
extent
while
this
may
be
the
case
in
a
meal
that
is
composed
of
a
sufficient
variety
of
foods
salads
have
a
definite
place
in
meals
as
they
are
planned
in
the
majority
of
households
often
there
is
a
tendency
to
limit
green
vegetables
or
fresh
fruits
in
the
diet
but
if
the
members
of
a
family
are
to
be
fed
an
ideal
diet
it
is
extremely
important
that
some
of
these
foods
enter
into
each
day
meals
a
fact
that
is
often
overlooked
there
is
no
more
effective
nor
appetizing
way
in
which
to
include
them
in
a
meal
than
in
the
serving
of
salads
in
addition
salads
make
a
strong
appeal
to
the
appetite
and
at
the
same
time
are
beneficial
so
far
as
the
health
of
the
family
is
concerned
purposes
of
because
of
the
wide
variety
of
salads
and
the
large
number
of
ingredients
from
which
a
selection
may
be
made
in
their
preparation
salads
can
be
used
for
various
purposes
the
housewife
who
gives
much
attention
to
the
artistic
side
of
the
serving
of
food
in
her
home
will
often
use
a
salad
to
carry
out
a
color
scheme
in
her
meal
this
is
of
course
the
least
valuable
use
that
salads
have
but
it
is
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked
the
chief
purpose
of
salads
in
a
meal
is
to
provide
something
that
the
rest
of
the
foods
served
in
the
meal
lack
even
though
it
is
not
desired
to
use
the
salad
to
carry
out
a
color
scheme
it
should
always
be
made
an
attractive
dish
as
is
well
known
nothing
is
so
unappetizing
as
a
salad
in
which
the
ingredients
have
not
been
properly
prepared
the
garnish
is
not
fresh
and
crisp
or
the
dressing
and
salad
ingredients
have
been
combined
in
such
a
way
as
to
appear
messy
or
stale
looking
there
is
no
excuse
for
such
conditions
and
they
need
not
exist
if
proper
attention
is
given
to
the
preparation
of
the
salad
selection
of
although
salads
through
their
variety
offer
the
housewife
an
opportunity
to
vary
her
meals
they
require
a
little
attention
as
to
their
selection
if
a
properly
balanced
meal
is
to
be
the
result
salads
that
are
high
in
food
value
or
contain
ingredients
similar
to
those
found
in
the
other
dishes
served
in
the
meal
should
be
avoided
with
dinners
or
with
other
heavy
meals
for
instance
a
fish
or
a
meat
salad
should
not
be
served
with
a
dinner
for
it
would
supply
a
quantity
of
protein
to
a
meal
that
is
already
sufficiently
high
in
this
food
substance
because
of
the
fact
that
meat
also
is
included
such
a
salad
however
has
a
place
in
a
very
light
luncheon
or
a
supper
for
it
helps
to
balance
such
a
meal
the
correct
salad
to
serve
with
a
dinner
that
contains
a
number
of
heavy
dishes
is
a
vegetable
salad
if
enough
vegetables
are
not
already
included
or
a
fruit
salad
if
the
dessert
does
not
consist
of
fruit
in
case
a
fruit
salad
is
selected
it
is
often
made
to
serve
for
both
the
salad
and
the
dessert
course
salad
in
addition
to
the
ingredients
used
in
the
preparation
of
salads
dressings
usually
form
an
important
part
these
vary
greatly
as
to
ingredients
and
consequently
as
to
composition
but
most
of
them
contain
considerable
fat
and
therefore
increase
the
food
value
of
the
salad
then
too
an
accompaniment
of
some
kind
is
generally
served
with
salads
to
make
them
more
attractive
and
more
pleasing
to
the
taste
this
may
be
a
wafer
or
a
cracker
of
some
description
or
a
small
sandwich
made
of
bread
cut
into
thin
slices
and
merely
buttered
or
buttered
and
then
spread
with
a
filling
of
some
sort
such
accompaniments
of
course
are
not
a
necessity
but
they
add
enough
to
the
salad
to
warrant
their
use
composition
of
salads
the
composition
as
well
as
the
total
food
value
of
salads
depends
entirely
on
the
ingredients
of
which
they
are
composed
with
an
understanding
of
the
composition
of
the
ingredients
used
in
salads
the
housewife
will
be
able
to
judge
fairly
accurately
whether
the
salad
is
low
medium
or
high
in
food
value
and
whether
it
is
high
in
protein
fat
or
carbohydrate
this
matter
is
important
and
should
receive
consideration
from
all
who
prepare
this
class
of
food
protein
in
as
may
be
expected
salads
that
are
high
in
protein
have
for
their
basis
or
contain
such
ingredients
as
meat
fish
fowl
cheese
eggs
nuts
or
dried
beans
the
amount
of
protein
that
such
a
salad
contains
naturally
varies
with
the
quantity
of
food
that
is
used
for
instance
a
salad
that
has
eggs
for
its
foundation
contains
considerable
protein
but
one
in
which
a
slice
or
two
of
egg
is
used
for
a
garnish
can
not
be
said
to
be
a
salad
fat
in
the
fat
in
salads
is
more
often
included
as
a
part
of
the
dressing
than
in
any
other
way
but
the
quantity
introduced
may
be
very
large
a
french
dressing
or
a
mayonnaise
dressing
as
a
rule
contains
a
sufficient
proportion
of
some
kind
of
oil
to
make
the
salad
in
which
it
is
used
somewhat
high
in
fat
in
fact
salads
are
often
used
as
a
means
of
introducing
fat
into
a
meal
and
whenever
this
is
done
they
should
be
considered
as
one
of
the
dishes
that
supply
food
material
to
the
meals
in
which
they
are
served
carbohydrate
in
for
the
most
part
salads
do
not
contain
carbohydrate
in
any
quantity
if
fruits
are
used
the
salad
will
of
course
contain
a
certain
amount
of
sugar
salads
in
which
potatoes
peas
beets
and
other
vegetables
are
used
also
contain
starch
or
sugar
in
varying
quantities
however
with
the
exception
of
potato
salad
salads
are
probably
never
taken
as
a
source
of
carbohydrate
mineral
salts
in
in
the
majority
of
salads
mineral
salts
are
an
important
ingredient
meat
and
fish
salads
are
the
only
ones
in
which
the
mineral
salts
are
not
especially
desirable
but
they
can
be
improved
in
this
respect
if
a
certain
amount
of
vegetables
are
mixed
with
them
salads
are
the
most
valuable
sources
of
mineral
salts
and
fruit
salads
come
next
in
addition
these
two
varieties
of
salads
contain
vitamines
which
are
substances
necessary
to
maintain
health
cheese
and
egg
salads
which
are
salads
are
also
valuable
for
the
vitamines
they
supply
cellulose
in
vegetable
and
fruit
salads
serve
to
supply
cellulose
in
the
diet
unless
the
meals
contain
sufficient
cellulose
in
some
other
form
the
use
of
such
salads
is
an
excellent
way
in
which
to
introduce
this
material
of
course
the
salads
composed
of
foods
high
in
cellulose
are
lower
in
food
value
than
others
but
the
salad
dressing
usually
helps
to
make
up
for
this
deficiency
ingredients
of
salads
variety
in
salad
one
of
the
advantages
of
salads
is
that
the
ingredients
from
which
they
can
be
made
are
large
in
number
in
fact
almost
any
cooked
or
raw
fruit
or
vegetable
or
any
meat
fowl
or
fish
whether
cooked
expressly
for
this
purpose
or
left
over
from
a
previous
meal
may
be
utilized
in
the
making
of
salads
canned
foods
of
these
varieties
may
also
be
used
to
advantage
for
salads
during
the
winter
when
fresh
foods
are
expensive
and
difficult
to
procure
the
idea
that
such
foods
can
not
be
used
is
wrong
as
far
as
meats
are
concerned
they
are
not
used
so
extensively
in
salads
as
are
fruits
and
vegetables
often
however
veal
or
pork
may
be
used
to
increase
the
quantity
of
material
needed
to
make
certain
salads
such
as
chicken
salad
canned
fish
or
fish
freshly
cooked
makes
appetizing
salads
and
if
there
is
not
a
sufficient
quantity
of
one
kind
on
hand
another
may
be
added
without
impairing
the
quality
of
the
salad
as
has
already
been
stated
almost
any
vegetable
raw
canned
or
freshly
cooked
can
be
used
in
the
making
of
salads
in
addition
these
vegetables
may
be
combined
in
almost
any
way
small
amounts
of
two
three
four
or
more
vegetables
may
be
combined
with
an
appetizing
salad
dressing
and
served
as
a
luncheon
or
dinner
salad
if
no
definite
recipe
is
followed
but
whatever
material
that
happens
to
be
on
hand
is
utilized
the
result
is
not
only
an
appetizing
salad
but
a
saving
of
vegetables
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
illustration
fig
fruits
both
canned
and
raw
are
largely
used
in
the
making
of
salads
as
with
vegetables
almost
any
combination
of
them
makes
a
delicious
salad
when
served
with
the
proper
dressing
thus
a
slice
of
pineapple
a
canned
peach
or
two
or
a
few
spoonfuls
of
cherries
may
be
added
to
grapefruit
oranges
bananas
or
whatever
fruit
may
happen
to
be
most
convenient
or
easy
to
procure
and
served
with
the
salad
dressing
that
is
preferred
vegetables
are
seldom
used
with
fruits
celery
being
the
only
one
that
is
ever
employed
in
this
way
on
the
other
hand
nuts
are
much
used
with
fruits
vegetables
meats
and
fish
in
the
making
of
salads
and
any
variety
may
be
utilized
salad
the
garnishing
of
salads
while
it
may
seem
to
be
an
unimportant
part
of
the
preparation
of
this
food
is
really
a
matter
that
demands
considerable
attention
lettuce
is
used
oftenest
for
this
purpose
but
almost
any
edible
green
such
as
endive
watercress
makes
an
excellent
garnish
generally
when
lettuce
is
the
garnish
the
leaves
are
used
whole
but
if
they
are
not
in
good
condition
for
garnishing
or
if
use
is
to
be
made
of
the
coarse
outside
leaves
of
the
stalks
they
may
be
arranged
in
a
pile
rolled
tight
and
then
as
shown
in
fig
cut
with
a
sharp
knife
into
narrow
strips
lettuce
prepared
in
this
way
is
said
to
be
and
a
bed
of
it
makes
a
very
attractive
garnish
for
many
kinds
of
salad
among
the
other
foods
used
as
a
garnish
are
certain
vegetables
that
give
a
contrast
in
color
such
as
pimiento
green
peppers
radishes
and
olives
slices
of
eggs
or
the
yolks
of
eggs
forced
through
a
ricer
likewise
offer
a
touch
of
attractive
color
nature
of
salad
when
a
salad
is
properly
made
a
salad
dressing
of
some
kind
is
usually
added
to
the
ingredients
that
are
selected
for
the
salad
this
dressing
generally
has
for
its
chief
ingredient
a
salad
oil
of
some
kind
many
satisfactory
varieties
of
which
are
to
be
found
on
the
market
olive
oil
has
always
been
the
most
popular
oil
used
for
this
purpose
and
in
many
respects
it
is
the
most
desirable
it
can
be
obtained
in
several
grades
the
price
varying
with
the
excellence
of
the
quality
the
best
grades
have
a

the
poorest
ones
are
somewhat
green
and
those
of
medium
quality
shade
between
these
two
colors
the
best
grades
are
also
clear
while
the
poorer
ones
are
usually
cloudy
the
better
the
quality
the
less
cloudy
the
oil
besides
olive
oil
however
there
are
oils
made
of
cottonseed
corn
and
nuts
many
of
these
products
are
cheaper
than
olive
oil
and
are
almost
if
not
quite
as
satisfactory
in
combination
with
the
oil
that
is
used
for
salad
dressing
there
is
always
an
acid
of
some
kind
such
as
vinegar
or
lemon
juice
to
these
ingredients
are
added
spices
and
flavoring
such
a
dressing
is
prepared
without
cooking
the
ingredients
being
combined
by
proper
mixing
or
beating
another
kind
of
dressing
that
is
much
used
is
known
as
boiled
salad
dressing
its
ingredients
are
similar
to
those
used
in
the
uncooked
salad
dressing
but
usually
less
fat
is
employed
and
eggs
alone
or
eggs
and
some
starchy
material
are
used
for
thickening
then
again
entirely
different
kinds
of
dressing
may
be
made
for
fruit
salads
sometimes
these
dressings
contain
no
fat
and
other
times
they
have
for
their
basis
sweet
or
sour
cream
but
usually
they
are
made
so
that
they
are
somewhat
acid
to
the
taste
relation
of
salads
to
meals
because
of
the
large
variety
of
ingredients
that
may
be
used
in
the
making
of
salads
it
is
usually
possible
to
make
the
salad
correspond
properly
with
the
other
dishes
in
the
meal
this
is
a
little
more
difficult
to
accomplish
when
materials
are
used
in
salads
but
even
in
this
event
the
addition
of
ingredients
that
will
make
the
salad
more
nearly
approach
what
must
be
supplied
is
usually
possible
if
the
meal
is
to
be
a
light
one
and
the
salad
is
to
serve
as
the
principal
dish
it
should
be
sufficiently
heavy
and
contain
enough
food
value
to
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
intended
it
should
be
decided
on
first
and
then
the
rest
of
the
dishes
should
be
planned
to
correspond
with
the
salad
on
the
other
hand
when
the
meal
is
a
heavy
one
and
the
salad
is
to
be
one
of
the
lighter
dishes
the
main
dishes
should
be
decided
on
first
and
the
salad
planned
so
that
it
will
correspond
properly
with
the
other
dishes
for
instance
with
meat
or
fish
as
the
main
course
of
the
meal
a
fish
egg
or
cheese
salad
would
obviously
be
the
wrong
thing
to
serve
instead
a
light
salad
of
vegetables
or
fruits
should
be
selected
for
such
a
meal
it
should
be
remembered
also
that
if
the
other
dishes
of
a
meal
contain
sufficient
food
value
to
make
the
meal
properly
nourishing
a
salad
containing
a
rich
dressing
will
provide
more
than
a
sufficient
supply
of
calories
and
consequently
should
be
avoided
another
point
that
should
not
be
neglected
in
selecting
a
salad
is
that
it
should
be
a
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
meal
as
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
while
several
foods
acid
in
flavor
do
not
necessarily
unbalance
a
meal
so
far
as
food
substances
and
food
value
are
concerned
they
provide
too
much
of
the
same
flavor
to
be
agreeable
to
most
persons
for
instance
if
the
meal
contains
an
acid
soup
such
as
tomato
and
a
vegetable
with
a
sour
dressing
such
as
beets
then
a
salad
that
is
also
acid
will
be
likely
to
add
more
of
a
sour
flavor
than
the
majority
of
persons
desire
then
too
it
is
not
a
good
plan
to
serve
in
the
salad
the
same
vegetable
that
is
served
in
the
soup
or
the
dinner
course
thus
creamed
celery
and
a
salad
containing
celery
and
tomato
soup
and
tomato
salad
are
bad
combinations
and
should
like
others
similar
to
them
be
carefully
avoided
even
though
such
vegetables
may
be
on
hand
in
quantity
they
can
usually
be
kept
for
another
meal
principles
of
salad
making
condition
of
salad
when
the
kind
of
salad
to
be
served
is
decided
on
the
selection
and
preparation
of
the
materials
are
the
next
matters
to
receive
attention
very
often
materials
that
are
on
hand
are
utilized
in
this
way
but
if
it
is
possible
to
select
the
ingredients
expressly
for
the
salad
they
should
be
very
carefully
chosen
any
kind
of
salad
but
particularly
a
vegetable
or
a
fruit
salad
becomes
much
more
attractive
if
it
is
made
with
ingredients
that
are
in
good
condition
and
that
are
attractive
in
appearance
they
should
therefore
be
fresh
and
crisp
and
never
mushy
wilted
nor
limp
of
course
this
does
not
mean
that
material
that
is
slightly
unattractive
must
be
discarded
for
it
can
usually
be
prepared
so
that
it
can
be
utilized
in
some
way
however
much
of
the
deterioration
of
salad
ingredients
before
they
are
used
can
be
avoided
if
proper
attention
is
given
to
them
after
they
come
into
the
home
without
doubt
the
best
way
in
which
to
keep
radishes
celery
parsley
watercress
and
other
greens
that
are
much
used
in
salads
is
to
wrap
them
loosely
in
a
moist
cloth
as
soon
as
they
are
received
in
the
home
and
then
put
them
in
a
cool
place
small
muslin
or
linen
bags
having
a
in
the
top
are
very
good
for
this
purpose
but
they
are
not
a
necessity
for
old
napkins
or
small
pieces
of
worn
cloth
will
do
very
well
cleaning
and
freshening
salad
in
the
making
of
a
salad
the
cleaning
of
the
ingredients
used
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
work
while
nothing
should
be
wasted
in
the
process
of
preparation
decayed
or
discolored
leaves
stems
or
parts
of
fruits
and
vegetables
should
of
course
be
removed
every
lettuce
leaf
and
every
part
of
other
salad
vegetables
should
be
looked
over
carefully
and
washed
separately
in
cold
water
to
accomplish
this
the
stalks
or
leaves
must
be
taken
apart
after
the
root
is
cut
off
then
before
they
are
used
they
should
be
examined
carefully
again
in
order
to
make
sure
that
no
small
bugs
nor
worms
and
no
dirt
remain
on
them
such
vegetables
will
become
crisp
if
they
are
allowed
to
remain
in
cold
water
long
enough
to
bring
back
their
natural
freshness
a
little
ice
added
to
the
water
helps
to
accomplish
this
more
quickly
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
lettuce
leaves
bruise
and
break
easily
and
so
must
be
handled
carefully
if
the
best
appearance
is
desired
when
cucumbers
are
to
be
used
for
salad
they
should
be
peeled
and
put
immediately
into
cold
water
to
become
crisp
or
they
may
first
be
sliced
or
diced
and
then
put
into
the
cold
water
they
should
never
be
allowed
to
stand
for
any
length
of
time
in
salt
water
if
it
is
desired
to
season
them
with
salt
a
little
may
be
added
to
the
water
in
which
they
are
made
crisp
but
it
will
also
be
necessary
to
add
ice
to
make
the
water
as
cold
as
possible
the
old
idea
that
soaking
cucumbers
in
salted
water
removes
something
injurious
has
been
proved
to
be
untrue
and
they
are
just
as
satisfactory
so
far
as
their
flavor
and
condition
are
concerned
when
they
are
not
subjected
to
this
treatment
radishes
celery
and
cabbage
may
be
made
crisp
in
the
same
way
as
are
cucumbers
and
lettuce
in
the
event
that
any
of
these
vegetables
are
allowed
to
stand
in
water
they
must
be
properly
drained
before
they
are
used
in
a
salad
for
any
water
that
remains
on
them
will
dilute
the
dressing
if
they
must
be
dried
very
quickly
they
may
be
patted
carefully
between
folds
of
cloth
preferably
linen
or
cheesecloth
or
they
may
be
allowed
to
stand
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
wire
basket
or
a
colander
care
should
be
taken
however
not
to
allow
them
to
stand
until
the
good
that
has
been
accomplished
by
making
them
crisp
in
cold
water
is
undone
preparing
fruits
for
after
fruits
have
been
carefully
cleaned
they
are
ready
to
be
peeled
and
cut
into
pieces
of
the
size
desired
for
the
salad
an
effort
should
always
be
made
to
have
the
pieces
equal
in
size
similar
in
shape
and
not
too
small
they
should
be
peeled
in
an
economical
way
but
at
the
same
time
should
be
prepared
as
attractively
as
possible
in
the
preparation
of
oranges
for
a
salad
the
fruit
is
peeled
as
if
it
were
an
apple
the
peeling
being
cut
deeply
enough
to
remove
the
skin
that
covers
the
sections
after
the
entire
orange
is
peeled
the
contents
of
each
section
should
be
removed
by
passing
a
sharp
knife
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
skin
between
the
sections
and
then
taking
out
the
pulp
without
any
of
this
skin
the
sections
may
then
be
used
whole
or
cut
into
pieces
grapefruit
may
be
prepared
in
the
same
way
as
oranges
upon
the
removal
of
the
whole
sections
they
may
be
left
whole
or
they
may
be
cut
once
or
twice
depending
on
the
kind
of
salad
and
the
appearance
desired
when
grapefruit
or
oranges
are
prepared
in
this
manner
they
make
a
much
more
agreeable
ingredient
for
fruit
salad
than
when
they
are
simply
cut
into
chunks
and
the
tough
skin
is
allowed
to
remain
on
the
pieces
no
waste
need
be
permitted
in
this
process
for
the
juice
may
be
extracted
from
what
remains
after
the
sections
have
been
removed
by
pressing
it
in
a
fruit
press
or
by
any
other
means
and
then
utilized
in
the
making
of
the
salad
dressing
or
kept
for
some
other
purpose
bananas
which
are
often
used
in
salads
should
be
peeled
any
bruised
or
decayed
portions
should
be
removed
and
the
surface
should
then
be
scraped
slightly
with
a
paring
knife
in
order
to
remove
the
pithy
surface
which
when
eaten
has
a
puckery
disagreeable
effect
when
fruits
of
any
kind
have
been
prepared
for
salad
and
can
not
be
used
at
once
they
may
be
kept
from
wilting
and
discoloring
if
they
are
put
where
they
will
keep
cool
and
are
sprinkled
with
a
little
lemon
juice
that
is
slightly
diluted
with
water
before
the
salad
materials
are
mixed
with
the
salad
dressing
however
all
juices
or
liquid
of
any
kind
should
be
carefully
drained
from
them
for
these
will
dilute
the
dressing
and
produce
a
salad
that
is
less
appetizing
in
both
appearance
and
flavor
preparing
nuts
for
when
nuts
are
to
be
used
in
a
salad
they
should
never
be
ground
in
a
grinder
rather
they
should
be
chopped
or
cut
into
small
pieces
with
a
knife
after
being
so
prepared
they
should
be
added
to
the
salad
just
before
it
is
put
on
the
table
this
is
a
matter
that
should
not
be
overlooked
for
if
the
salad
is
allowed
to
stand
very
long
after
the
nuts
are
added
they
will
discolor
the
dressing
and
cause
the
salad
to
become
dark
and
gray
looking
marinating
salad
to
improve
the
flavor
of
such
salads
as
chicken
veal
lobster
or
crab
the
ingredients
are
usually
marinated
with
a
sour
dressing
of
some
description
before
the
salad
dressing
is
added
as
is
explained
in
essentials
of
cookery
part
marinating
involves
the
seasoning
of
meat
or
fish
by
means
of
vinegar
or
french
dressing
the
preparation
used
to
marinate
salad
ingredients
may
be
plain
vinegar
to
which
salt
and
pepper
are
added
or
it
may
be
a
french
dressing
which
is
prepared
by
mixing
vinegar
olive
oil
salt
and
pepper
in
the
proper
proportions
whichever
preparation
is
used
should
be
poured
over
the
materials
after
they
are
cut
or
prepared
for
the
salad
and
only
enough
to
moisten
each
piece
slightly
should
be
used
the
ingredients
should
then
be
carefully
mixed
with
the
dressing
to
avoid
breaking
or
crushing
them
and
should
be
allowed
to
stand
in
a
cold
place
for
a
few
minutes
then
they
should
be
drained
so
that
none
of
the
material
used
to
marinate
them
remains
on
the
salad
when
the
other
dressing
is
added
with
this
done
the

is
ready
for
whatever
salad
dressing
is
to
be
used
potato
salad
and
salads
containing
such
vegetables
as
carrots
peas
string
beans
etc
are
also
improved
by
being
marinated
in
the
same
way
as
salads
made
of
meat
fowl
and
fish
this
sort
of
preparation
involves
a
little
more
work
it
is
true
but
it
usually
produces
such
gratifying
results
that
it
justifies
the
expenditure
of
the
extra
effort
in
the
first
place
a
slightly
smaller
amount
of

be
required
when
the
ingredients
are
marinated
and
in
addition

better
looking

be
made
for
the
dressing
need
not
be
mixed
with
the
salad
but
merely
placed
on
top
in
case
the
housewife
prefers
not
to
take
the
time
nor
the
trouble
to
marinate
a
salad
she
should
at
least
mix
thoroughly
with
salt
and
pepper
the
ingredients
that
require
seasoning
the
fact
that
a
salad
should
be
a
well
and
highly
seasoned
dish
must
never
be
overlooked
as
can
be
readily
understood
a
bland
salad
without
character
is
never
so
appetizing
as
one
that
is
crisp
fresh
well
made
and
properly
seasoned
serving
salads
several
different
ways
of
serving
salads
are
in
practice
perhaps
the
most
convenient
method
of
serving
this
dish
is
to
prepare
individual
portions
of
it
on
salad
plates
in
the
kitchen
and
then
set
these
on
the
table
at
each
person
place
if
a
simple
table
service
is
followed
the
salad
may
be
put
on
the
table
at
the
same
time
as
the
rest
of
the
meal
the
correct
position
for
the
salad
plate
is
at
the
side
of
the
dinner
plate
and
just
a
little
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
table
than
the
plate
the
plates
on
which
salad
is
served
should
be
large
enough
to
prevent
the
difficulty
in
eating
that
would
be
experienced
if
the
plate
were
a
trifle
small
it
should
therefore
be
remembered
that
the
salad
plate
is
the
next
larger
in
size
to
the
plate
in
case
individual
salads
are
to
be
prepared
the
plate
should
first
be
garnished
with
whatever
vegetable
green
is
selected
for
this
purpose
if
lettuce
is
to
be
used
a
single
leaf
several
very
small
center
leaves
or
a
small
quantity
of
shredded
lettuce
will
be
sufficient
for
a
great
deal
of
garnish
is
never
desirable
in
case
the
leaves
are
very
large
one
may
be
divided
in
half
and
each
part
utilized
then
the
salad
ingredients
which
have
already
been
combined
should
be
piled
in
a
neat
heap
on
top
of
the
garnish
either
with
or
without
the
salad
dressing
if
the
salad
dressing
is
not
mixed
with
the
materials
a
spoonful
or
two
of
it
should
be
placed
on
top
of
them
sometimes
for
the
effect
of
color
additional
garnish
of
some
kind
is
used
for
a
vegetable
or
a
meat
salad
this
may
be
egg
yolk
put
through
a
sieve
slices
of
eggs
olives
or
radishes
cut
in
fancy
shapes
or
strips
of
pimiento
and
for
fruit
salad
it
may
be
cherries
or
colored
fruits
cut
into
various
fancy
shapes
another
method
of
serving
this
dish
is
to
place
the
entire
salad
on
a
rather
large
deep
plate
such
as
a
chop
plate
or
a
regular
salad
dish
and
then
serve
it
at
the
table
whenever
it
is
desired
when
this
is
done
the
dish
that
is
used
should
be
well
garnished
with
a
bed
of
vegetable
green
in
the
same
way
that
a
small
individual
plate
is
garnished
then
the
salad
ingredients
should
be
nicely
arranged
on
this
bed
and
the
dressing
if
it
has
not
already
been
mixed
with
them
should
be
poured
over
the
whole
in
serving
salad
in
this
way
there
is
much
more
chance
of
arranging
the
ingredients
symmetrically
and
garnishing
the
salad
attractively
than
when
it
is
served
on
small
plates
the
large
plate
containing
the
salad
together
with
the
small
salad
plates
should
be
placed
before
the
hostess
or
whoever
is
to
serve
the
salad
when
it
is
served
a
leaf
of
the
lettuce
or
other
green
used
for
garnishing
should
first
be
put
on
each
salad
plate
and
the
salad
should
be
served
on
this
a
large
fork
and
a
large
spoon
are
needed
when
salad
is
served
in
this
manner
still
another
way
of
serving
salad
and
perhaps
a
more
attractive
one
than
either
of
those
already
described
consists
in
arranging
the
ingredients
in
a
salad
bowl
placing
this
on
the
table
and
serving
from
the
bowl
to
the
salad
plates
in
this
method
a
french
dressing
is
generally
used
and
this
is
often
mixed
at
the
table
and
added
to
the
salad
just
before
it
is
put
on
the
small
plates
such
a
salad
can
be
made
very
attractive
and
it
should
be
remembered
above
all
things
that
the
appearance
of
a
salad
is
its
great
asset
until
it
is
eaten
and
that
an
artistically
made
salad
always
helps
to
make
the
meal
more
satisfactory
in
a
dinner
the
salad
is
generally
served
as
a
separate
course
but
in
such
a
meal
as
luncheon
it
may
be
used
as
the
main
dish
if
it
is
used
as
a
separate
course
it
should
be
served
immediately
after
the
dinner
course
has
been
removed
from
the
table
the
salad
plate
should
be
placed
directly
before
the
person
served
forks
especially
designed
with
a
wide
prong
on
one
side
and
known
as
are
the
right
type
of
fork
to
serve
with
this
dish
but
if
none
are
available
ordinary
table
forks
of
a
small
size
may
be
used
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
salad
should
not
be
cut
with
the
knife
at
the
table
but
should
be
eaten
entirely
with
the
fork
salad
dressings
and
their
preparation
as
has
been
implied
various
salad
dressings
may
be
made
to
serve
with
salads
the
kind
of
dressing
to
select
depends
both
on
the
variety
of
salad
served
and
on
the
personal
preference
of
those
to
whom
it
is
served
some
of
these
contain
only
a
few
ingredients
and
are
comparatively
simple
to
make
while
others
are
complex
and
involve
considerable
work
in
their
making
whether
simple
or
elaborate
however
the
salad
dressing
should
be
carefully
chosen
so
that
it
will
blend
well
with
the
ingredients
of
the
salad
with
which
it
is
used
a
number
of
recipes
for
salad
dressings
are
here
given
they
are
taken
up
before
the
recipes
for
salads
so
that
the
beginner
will
be
familiar
with
the
different
varieties
when
they
are
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
salads
as
many
of
the
recipes
as
possible
should
be
tried
not
only
for
the
knowledge
that
will
be
gained
but
also
for
the
practical
experience
french
a
dressing
that
is
very
simply
made
and
that
can
probably
be
used
with
a
greater
variety
of
salads
than
any
other
is
french
dressing
for
instance
it
may
be
used
with
any
vegetable
salad
with
salads
containing
almost
any
combination
of
fruit
and
with
meat
fish
and
egg
salads
it
is
true
of
course
that
dressing
blends
very
well
with
fruit
salad
and
is
considered
by
most
persons
to
be
more
delicious
than
french
dressing
but
if
one
is
pressed
for
time
and
does
not
have
the
necessary
ingredients
for
making
any
other
kind
this
one
may
nearly
always
be
utilized
in
addition
to
these
uses
french
dressing
as
has
been
previously
explained
may
also
be
used
to
marinate
salads
before
mayonnaise
or
other
dressing
is
mixed
with
them
a
point
that
should
always
be
remembered
in
the
making
of
this
dressing
or
any
other
dressing
containing
oil
is
that
the
flavor
of
the
oil
has
much
to
do

the
desirability
of
the
finished

without
the

it

not
one
of
the
simplest

to
prepare
it
meets
with
much
favor
being
used
almost
as
extensively
as
french
dressing
but
it
is
perhaps
less
desirable
with
fruit
salads
than
with
others
it
is
also
much
used
as
a
basis
for
numerous
other

since
it
requires
considerable
time
for

a
wise
plan
is
to

it

quantities

will
be
noted
that
the
preparation
of
this

is
similar
to
that
of
a

with
the

since
the

requires
longer

so
that

curdles
it
may
be
known
that
the

have
cooked

this
condition
may
be
remedied
by
placing

with
the
knowledge
already
obtained
of
the

value

that
are
generally
used

ingredients
in

salads
the
housewife
ought
to
have
no
difficulty
in
determining
whether
she
is
giving
her
family
a
salad
that
is
high
or
low
in
food
value
for
instance
she
should
know
that
the
food
value
of
a
plain
lettuce
or
cucumber
salad
is
lower
than
that
of
one
made
from
potatoes
because
of
the
different
values
in
the
vegetables
in
addition
she
ought
to
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
dressing
added
to
salads
has
in
most
cases
greater
food
value
than
the
other
ingredients
of
the
salad
equipped
with
such
knowledge
she
will
observe
that
the
vegetable
salads
here
given
are
comparatively
low
in
food
value
consequently
nearly
every
one
of
them
will
lend
itself
nicely
for
use
with
a
dinner
or
a
comparatively
heavy
meal
in
these
recipes
as
well
as
in
those
for
the
other
kinds
of
salad
the
proportion
of
ingredients
may
be
varied
according
to
the
quantity
of
the
particular
food
in
supply
for
instance
if
a
recipe
for
a
salad
of
peas
and
celery
calls
for
cupful
of
each
of
these
vegetables
and
only
cupful
of
celery
can
be
obtained
there
is
no
reason
why
the
difference
can
not
be
made
up
by
using
cupfuls
of
peas
but
if
such
a
change
is
to
be
made
the
ingredients
should
be
increased
or
decreased
in
the
correct
proportion
then
the
quantity
of
salad
that
the
recipe
is
intended
to
produce
will
not
be
altered
and
the
housewife
will
know
just
how
many
the
salad
will
serve

the
various
recipes

nature
of
sandwiches
when
salads
are
mentioned
sandwiches
naturally
come
to
the
mind
for
while
they
have
many
other
uses
they
are
often
served
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
salad
sandwiches
are
generally
thought
of
as
two
thin
slices
of
bread
put
together
with
a
filling
such
as
meat
cheese
fruit
etc
however
there
are
as
many
varieties
of
sandwiches
as
of
salads
and
they
serve
a
large
number
of
purposes
for
instance
they
may
be
merely
two
pieces
of
buttered
bread
put
together
or
they
may
be
elaborate
both
as
to
shape
and
contents
in
reality
many
different
things
are
considered
as
sandwiches
sometimes
one
piece
of
bread
spread
with
a
filling
and
usually
decorated
in
some
way
is
served
with
afternoon
tea
or
a
very
light
luncheon
then
again
sandwiches
often
consist
of
three
layers
of
bread
instead
of
two
and
for
other
kinds
the
bread
is
toasted
instead
of
being
used
plain
as
in
the
case
of
salads
the
housewife
must
determine
from
their
composition
the
place
that
sandwiches
should
take
in
the
meal
for
their
food
value
depends
on
what
is
used
with
the
bread
a
sandwich
that
is
high
in
food
value
may
be
used
as
the
main
dish
in
a
light
meal
while
one
that
is
comparatively
low
in
this
respect
generally
accompanies
another
dish
as
for
instance
a
salad
or
is
used
to
take
the
place
of
plain
bread
general
principles
of
sandwich

although
sandwiches
vary
greatly
in
both
form
and
contents
bread
or
something
that
may
be
substituted
for
it
always
forms
the
foundation
of
this
class
of
food
white
bread
is
much
employed
for
this
purpose
but
rye
graham
brown
or
bread
or
in
fact
any
other
desirable
kind
may
be
used
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
sandwich
or
the
kind
preferred
several
matters
concerning
the
bread
that
is
used
however
should
receive
attention
if
successful
sandwiches
are
to
be
the
result
in
the
first
place
the
bread
used
should
be
at
least
hours
old
as
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
cutting
bread
that
is
any
fresher
another
requirement
is
that
the
bread
should
be
firm
and
of
a
comparatively
fine
texture
the
shape
of
the
loaf
must
also
be
taken
into
consideration
as
is
easily
understood
there
will
be
a
considerable
waste
of
bread
if
a
round
sandwich
is
made
from
a
square
loaf
or
a
square
sandwich
is
cut
from
a
round
loaf
when
round
sandwiches
are
desired
it
is
advisable
to
bake
the
bread
in
round
loaves
unless
some
good
use
can
be
made
of
the
bread
that
is
trimmed
off
in
cutting
the
sandwiches
illustration

for
sandwich
making
bakers
often
sell
special
sandwich
bread
some
persons
prefer
sandwiches
made
of
such
bread
but
as
a
rule
it
will
be
found
easier
to
use
the
ordinary
bread
baked
by
the
baker
or
bread
that
is
baked
in
the
home
for
this
purpose
when
bread
is
being
made
for
sandwiches
a
good
plan
is
to
give
the
dough
a
little
additional
kneading
and
toward
the
end
of
the
kneading
to
work
in
a
small
amount
of
flour
perhaps
a
little
extra
sugar
and
if
desired
an
egg
then
if
it
is
not
allowed
to
rise
as
much
as
usual
it
will
make
a
bread
that
is
finer
in
texture
and
easier
to
handle
utensils
for
sandwich
very
few
utensils
are
required
for
the
making
of
sandwiches
but
those
which
are
used
must
be
of
the
right
kind
if
sandwiches
are
desired
to
cut
the
bread
a
large
sharp
knife
must
be
used
for
generally
the
bread
is
required
to
be
cut
thin
and
this
can
not
be
done
successfully
unless
the
knife
is
sufficiently
sharp
in
addition
a
case
knife
or
a
small
spatula
is
needed
for
the
spreading
of
the
bread
if
sandwiches
in
any
quantity
are
to
be
spread
with
a
filling
besides
butter
two
case
knives
or
a
case
knife
and
a
spatula
should
be
provided
making
the
point
that
should
be
remembered
about
sandwiches
is
that
they
should
be
as
dainty
as
possible
therefore
the
illustration
fig
bread
should
usually
be
cut
thin
and
the
crust
should
be
removed
if
a
large
number
of
sandwiches
are
to
be
made
it
is
often
a
good
idea
to
remove
the
crust
from
the
loaf
as
shown
in
fig
before
slicing
the
bread
more
frequently
however
the
cutting
is
done
first
as
in

then
after
the
bread
is
spread
the
crust
is
removed
from
a
pile
of
slices
at

time
a
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
making
sandwiches
unless
care
is
taken
in
matching
the
slices
after
being
cut
they
should
be
laid
out
in
pairs
with
corresponding
sides
together
so
that
when
they
are
spread
two
pieces
that
do
not
fit
will
not
have
to
be
put

the
plan
of

the

usually
buttered
before
the

to
make
the
butter
soft
enough
to
spread
easily
it

be
creamed
with
a
spoon

shown
in

it
should
never
be
melted
with
the
bread
sliced

the

one

a
pair
of
slices
should
be
spread
with
butter

the
two
slices
should
be
put

the
dessert
in
the
meal
general
discussion
a
dessert
always
consists
of
sweet
food
of
some
kind
and
in
the
usual
meal
it
is
served
as
the
last
course
sometimes
especially
in
more
elaborate
meals
another
course
such
as
cheese
and
coffee
may
follow
but
ordinarily
the
dessert
is
the
last
food
that
is
served
the
eating
of
something
sweet
after
the
heavy
course
of
a
meal
has
undoubtedly
become
a
habit
with
almost
every
person
at
any
rate
a
dinner
in
which
a
dessert
is
not
included
generally
leaves
one
unsatisfied
and
gives
the
feeling
that
the
meal
has
not
been
properly
completed
some
housewives
however
make
the
mistake
of
serving
a
heavy
dessert
after
a
large
meal
with
the
result
that
those
served
leave
the
table
feeling
they
have
had
too
much
to
eat
if
this
occurs
the
same
combination
of
food
should
be
avoided
another
time
and
a
simple
dessert
used
to
follow
a
dinner
that
is
already
sufficiently
heavy
there
is
nothing
fixed
about
the
dessert
course
of
a
meal
it
may
be
very
simple
or
it
may
be
as
complicated
and
elaborate
as
desired
to
make
an
elaborate
dessert
usually
requires
a
good
deal
of
time
and
unless
time
and
care
can
be
devoted
to
such
a
dessert
it
should
not
be
attempted
however
whether
a
dessert
is
simple
or
elaborate
it
should
always
be
made
sufficiently
attractive
to
appeal
to
an
appetite
that
is
already
almost
satisfied
besides
providing
a
chance
to
end
a
meal
in
an
attractive
and
appetizing
way
it
offers
a
splendid
opportunity
to
carry
out
a
color
scheme
that
may
be
adopted
for
a
meal
of
course
this
is
seldom
done
except
for
a
party
or
a
company
meal
for
a
color
scheme
has
no
particular
value
other
than
to
appeal
to
the
esthetic
sense
the
cost
of
desserts
is
also
a
matter
that
may
be
varied
for
instance
it
may
be
low
as
in
plain
rice
pudding
which
contains
merely
rice
and
milk
or
it
may
be
high
as
in
such
concoctions
as
mousse
or
parfait
which
may
contain
cream
eggs
gelatine
and
fruit
it
is
possible
then
with
correct
planning
to
make
the
price
of
the
dessert
equalize
the
cost
of
the
meal
for
example
if
the
previous
courses
have
contained
expensive
foods
the
dessert
should
be
an
economical
one
whereas
an
expensive
one
is
permissible
either
when
an
elaborate
meal
is
desired
or
when
the
cheapness
of
the
food
served
before
the
dessert
warrants
greater
expense
in
the
final
dish
the
fact
that
desserts
are
often
a
means
of
economically
utilizing
foods
should
not
be
overlooked
a
famous
cooking
expert
is
responsible
for
the
statement
that
any
edible
may
be
utilized
in
the
making
of
soup
salad
or
dessert
this
is
an
important
truth
to
keep
in
mind
for
with
the
exception
of
a
knowledge
of
the
correct
purchase
and
cooking
of
foods
nothing
makes
so
much
for
economy
in
cookery
as
the
economical
use
of
leftovers
desserts
are
really
of
two
kinds
those
which
are
heavy
such
as
hot
puddings
and
pastry
and
those
which
are
light
or
of
a
less
substantial
nature
such
as
gelatine
custards
ices
etc
in
general
light
desserts
are
either
frozen
or
allowed
to
cool
before
they
are
used
and
consequently
may
be
made
some
time
before
the
serving
of
the
meal
it
is
with
desserts
of
this
kind
that
this
section
deals
the
heavier
desserts
being
discussed
elsewhere
composition
and
food
value
of
desserts
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
composition
and
food
value
of
desserts
in
order
that
the
meals
in
which
they
are
served
may
be
properly
balanced
for
instance
when
a
housewife
understands
the
value
of
the
ingredients
used
in
the
preparation
of
a
dessert
she
will
be
able
to
determine
the
kind
of
dessert
necessary
to
supply
what
is
lacking
in
the
meal
of
course
if
she
first
decides
on
a
particular
dessert
that
she
wants
to
serve
it
will
be
necessary
for
her
to
plan
the
other
dishes
accordingly
this
however
is
not
the
logical
way
in
which
to
plan
meals
it
is
much
more
reasonable
to
have
the
dessert
supply
anything
that
the
meal
may
lack
in
the
way
of
food
constituents
in
considering
the
food
value
of
desserts
it
should
be
remembered
that
they
are
just
as
valuable
as
the
ingredients
they
contain
the
ingredients
in
which
this
class
of
foods
is
highest
are
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
starch
or
sugar
or
both
protein
especially
when
eggs
in
any
quantity
are
used
and
fat
carbohydrate
in
as
a
rule
the
carbohydrate
in
desserts
is
obtained
from
two
sources
it
is
furnished
by
the
sugar
honey
or
other
sweetening
that
is
added
to
the
mixture
or
it
is
in
the
form
of
starch
added
to
thicken
as
in
the
case
of
corn
starch
or
material
actually
used
as
the
basis
of
the
dessert
itself
such
as
rice
tapioca
bread
etc
these
ingredients
are
of
course
easily
digested
if
they
are
properly
cooked
on
the
whole
desserts
can
therefore
be
regarded
as
foods
protein
in
protein
is
usually
supplied
in
desserts
by
means
of
eggs
and
milk
custard
made
almost
exclusively
of
these
two
foods
is
sufficiently
high
in
protein
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
planning
of
the
main
dish
for
the
meal
because
of
the
presence
of
this
food
substance
in
many
desserts
proper
cooking
is
a
matter
to
which
attention
must
be
given
for
it
makes
for
digestibility
as
well
as
consistency
cream
added
to
desserts
also
supplies
a
little
protein
if
wheat
flour
is
used
it
adds
a
small
amount
of
protein
in
the
form
of
gluten
most
of
the
starchy
preparations
such
as
tapioca
rice
corn
starch
however
are
almost
entirely
devoid
of
protein
material
gelatine
desserts
are
sometimes
thought
to
be
foods
but
as
is
explained
elsewhere
gelatine
is
not
regarded
as
true
protein
if
such
desserts
are
to
contain
protein
it
must
come
from
some
other
source
fat
in
fat
is
usually
added
to
desserts
in
the
form
of
cream
sometimes
a
little
butter
is
used
in
the
making
of
a
dessert
but
for
the
most
part
the
chief
source
of
fat
in
desserts
is
the
plain
or
whipped
cream
that
is
added
to
them
or
served
with
them
principles
of
dessert
making
attractiveness
of
attractiveness
as
has
been
mentioned
is
essential
in
a
dessert
if
it
is
to
appeal
to
an
appetite
that
may
be
nearly
satisfied
by
the
time
the
dessert
course
is
reached
to
render
dessert
attractive
it
should
be
carefully
made
and
artistically
garnished
and
served
it
may
be
made
to
appeal
through
a
sense
of
beautiful
proportion
an
attractive
color
combination
or
an
attractive
or
artistic
preparation
because
sweets
are
liked
by
most
persons
it
is
seldom
difficult
to
prepare
attractive
desserts
indeed
the
housewife
who
fails
in
this
respect
may
be
said
to
be
unsuccessful
in
the
easiest
part
of
cookery
economical
use
of
the
ingredients
required
for
dessert
making
are
usually
expensive
ones
although
there
are
some
marked
exceptions
to
this
rule
in
view
of
this
fact
the
housewife
should
strive
to
use
economically
the
various
ingredients
she
purchases
for
instance
the
first
strawberries
which
because
of
their
scarcity
are
much
more
expensive
than
the
later
ones
may
be
made
to
go
much
further
if
they
are
used
in
shortcake
than
if
they
are
served
as
plain
fruit
in
making
a
fruit
gelatine
apples
and
bananas
while
they
may
not
be
so
attractive
as
canned
pineapple
and
maraschino
cherries
are
much
cheaper
and
may
be
used
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
fruit
that
is
put
into
the
gelatine
then
too
it
is
well
to
remember
that
cream
goes
much
further
with
desserts
when
it
is
whipped
than
when
it
is
served
plain
applying
cookery
rules
to
if
the
best
results
in
dessert
making
are
to
be
obtained
the
rules
that
govern
the
cooking
of
various
ingredients
in
other
dishes
should
be
observed
for
instance
eggs
should
not
be
cooked
at
a
higher
temperature
in
making
desserts
than
when
they
are
being
poached
then
again
starchy
materials
that
are
used
to
thicken
desserts
or
that
form
a
basis
for
these
dishes
must
be
thoroughly
cooked
in
order
to
be
agreeable
and
digestible
therefore
to
put
both
starchy
materials
and
eggs
into
a
dessert
at
the
same
time
and
give
them
the
same
amount
of
cooking
at
the
same
temperature
is
as
the
woman
who
understands
cookery
knows
not
only
a
very
poor
plan
but
a
possible
means
of
ruining
good
material
another
waste
of
good
material
results
when
a
custard
is
so
prepared
that
it
is
half
water
or
when
a
rice
or
a
bread
pudding
floats
in
liquid
that
was
never
intended
to
be
served
with
it
again
nothing
is
less
tasty
than
a
pudding
or
a
blanc
mange
in
which
the
starch
has
not
been
thoroughly
cooked
or
a
tapioca
pudding
in
which
the
centers
of
the
tapioca
are
hard
and
uncooked
such
mistakes
as
these
however
can
be
avoided
if
the
housewife
will
apply
to
desserts
the
principles
she
has
learned
in
other
parts
of
cookery
for
knowledge
coupled
with
care
in
preparation
is
the
keynote
of
successful
dessert
making
the
cookery
methods
usually
applied
in
the
preparation
of
desserts
are
boiling
steaming
dry
steaming
and
baking
as
these
methods
are
explained
in
of
part
and
are
used
constantly
in
the
preparation
of
the
majority
of
dishes
served
in
a
meal
they
should
by
this
time
be
so
well
understood
that
practically
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
applying
them
to
desserts
cold
desserts
and
their
preparation
sauces
and
whipped
cream
many
cold
desserts
may
be
served
without
any
accompaniments
but
very
often
they
are
much
improved
by
the
addition
of
a
sauce
of
some
kind
for
instance
when
a
custard
or
a
blanc
mange
is
very
thick
and
heavy
it
can
be
made
more
agreeable
to
the
taste
if
it
is
served
with
a
sauce
of
some
description
several
recipes
for
sauces
that
may
be
used
with
any
cold
dessert
in
need
of
an
accompaniment
are
here
given
so
that
the
housewife
will
not
be
at
a
loss
when
she
desires
to
serve
a
sauce
with
a
dessert
she
has
made
the
sauce
to
use
depends
on
the
dessert
that
it
is
to
accompany
the
custard

here
given

be
used
for
example
with
plain
mixtures
that
do

with

nature
it
is
also
very
satisfactory

whipped
cream
is
frequently
served
with
cold
desserts
in
place
of
a
sauce
or
as
a
garnish
if
cream
is
too
thin
to
whip
it
will
have
to
be
served
plain
but
it
is
an
economy
to
whip
it
for
whipped
cream
goes
much
further
to
make
whipping
possible
the
cream
must
have
a
comparatively
high
percentage
of
fat
the
higher
the
percentage
of
fat
however
the
more
expensive
will
be
the
cream
one
of
the
requirements
of
successfully
whipped
cream
especially
in
summer
is
that
it
be
as
cold
as
possible
warm
cream
does
not
whip
nearly
so
readily
as
cold
if
it
is
necessary
to
whip
cream
in
warm
weather
or
in
a
warm
place
the
bowl
containing
the
cream
may
be
packed
in
a
larger
one
containing
ice
and
salt
and
allowed
to
stand
for
some
time
before
the
whipping
is
begun
a
utensil
with
a
round
bottom
is
the
best
to
use
for
whipping
cream
either
an
egg
whip
or
a
rotary
beater
may
be
used
to
do
the
beating
which
should
be
done
rapidly
if
the
cream
does
not
show
signs
of
whipping
within
a
reasonable
time
the
result
is
likely
to
be
the
formation
of
little
globules
of
butter
cream
that
whips
properly
will
become
stiff
and
light
in
a
short
time
after
cream
has
been
whipped

stiff
it
should
be
sweetened
slightly
with

other
desirable

custard
desserts
principles
of
custard
making
many
of
the
desserts
that
are
served
cold
come
under
the
head
of
custards
these
are
dishes
high
in
protein
and
consist
of
two
varieties
those
thickened
entirely
by
eggs
and
known
as
and
those
in
which
a
starchy
material
is
used
for
part
of
the
thickening
they
may
be
cooked
by
steaming
dry
steaming
or
baking
in
true
custards
there
must
be
a
sufficient
number
of
eggs
to
thicken
the
desired
amount
of
milk
for
nothing
else
produces
thickening
to
these
two
ingredients
may
be
added
sweetening
in
the
form
of
sugar
sirup
honey
etc
and
flavoring
of
any
desirable
kind
the
plain
custard
thus
produced
makes
an
excellent
dessert
and
one
that
is
easily
digested
in
fact
it
can
be
digested
with
such
ease
that
it
is
used
perhaps
more
frequently
in
the
diets
of
children
and
invalids
than
any
other
single
dessert
for
instance
when
it
is
necessary
that
eggs
and
milk
be
taken
in
the
diet
they
usually
become
monotonous
after
a
time
but
a
little
variety
may
be
added
to
the
diet
by
serving
them
in
the
form
of
custard
while
this
is
an
expensive
dessert
when
eggs
are
high
in
price
its
value
is
such
that
it
should
be
prepared
frequently
for
children
in
spite
of
its
cost
although
custards
are
considered
to
decrease
in
quality
as
fewer
eggs
are
used
and
starch
in
some
form
is
added
for
thickening
many
excellent
custard
desserts
are
made
in
this
way
then
too
plain
custard
is
often
utilized
in
the
making
of
desserts
such
as
tapioca
rice
and
bread
puddings
in
such
an
event
fewer
eggs
are
used
and
the
starchy
material
is
depended
on
for
a
certain
amount
of
the
thickening
because
the
starchy
foods
used
are
generally
cheaper
than
eggs
custard
desserts
that
rely
partly
on
starch
for
their
thickening
are
more
economical
than
those
thickened
entirely
by
eggs
they
are
also
different
in
composition
and
texture
being
lower
in
protein
because
of
a
smaller
proportion
of
eggs
and
higher
in
carbohydrate
because
of
additional
starch
nevertheless
they
are
delicious
desserts
and
find
much
favor
for
its
thickness
or
solidity
a
custard
depends
largely
on
the
thickening
property
of
the
protein
material
in
the
eggs
here
again
as
in
the
preparation
of
other
foods
only
a
certain
proportion
of
milk
and
eggs
will
thicken
or
solidify
upon
being
cooked
in
general
the
correct
proportion
for
a
plain
custard
is
egg
to
cupful
of
so
important
is
this
proportion
that
it
should
be
memorized
before
the
eggs
are
added
to
the
milk
they
are
of
course
beaten
but
their
beating
is
a
matter
of
little
consequence
for
they
are
used
merely
to
supply
thickening
and
give
richness
and
not
to
produce
lightness
therefore
they
need
only
be
mixed
well
and
beaten
slightly
as
any
increase
in
the
amount
of
the
beating
adds
nothing
the
sweetening
and
flavoring
used
in
custards
should
be
in
sufficient
quantity
to
suit
the
tastes
of
those
who
are
to
eat
the
dessert
however
the
usual
proportion
of
sugar
is
tablespoonful
to
egg
and
cupful
of
a
tiny
pinch
of
salt
added
to
a
mixture
of
this
kind
always
improves
its
flavor
and
should
never
be
omitted
because
of
the
various
ways
of
making
custards
they
differ
somewhat
when
they
are
done
they
may
be
thin
enough
to
pour
or
they
may
be
set
and
so
thick
that
they
can
be
cut
the
consistency
of
the
finished
product
depends
of
course
on
the
proportion
of
the
ingredients
used
and
the
method
of
cookery
adopted
recipes
for
custards
and
related
desserts
baked
practically
no
skill
is
required
in
the
preparation
of
baked
custard
but
care
must
be
taken
during
the
baking
in
order
that
the
right
temperature
be
applied
for
the
proper
length
of
time
custard
of
this
kind
is
quickly
made
and
finds
favor
with
most
persons
it
may
be
baked
in
individual
baking
dishes
and
then
served
in
these
or
it
may
be
cooked
in
a
large
baking
dish
and
served
either
before
or
after
it
is
placed
on
the
table
individual
baking
dishes
are
perhaps
more
satisfactory
for
as
there
is
a
smaller
amount
of
material
the
heat
can
penetrate
more
quickly
and
evenly
to
the
center
whatever
kind
of
dish
is
used
however
should
be
placed
in
a
pan
of
warm
water
so
that
the
custard
will
bake
evenly
the
water
in
the
pan
should
not
boil
as
this
tends
to
make
the
custard
whey
or
separate
illustration
fig
testing
doneness
of

with

several
tests
can
be
applied
to
custard
to
determine
whether
it
is
sufficiently
baked
as
the
heat
penetrates
to
the
center
last
this
part
is
the
last
to
cook
and
it
is
therefore
the
place
where
the
testing
should
be
done
one
test
consists
in
touching
the
center
with
the
tip
of
the
finger
to
find
out
whether
it
is
firm
or
not
a
more
common
test
however
is
shown
in
fig
to
perform
this
test
the
blade
of
a
silver
knife
is
inserted
in
the
center
as
illustrated
if
the
blade
comes
out
clean
it
may
be
known
that
the
custard
is
sufficiently
baked
but
if
the
mixture
sticks
to
the
knife
the
custard
requires
more
baking
before
the
knife
blade
is
inserted
however
the
skin
that
covers
the
custard
must
be
broken
if
this
is
not
done
the
skin
is
sure
to
cling
to
the
knife
the
chief
requirement
of
a
successful
custard
is
that
its
texture
be
right
and
the
temperature
at
which
the
baking
is
done
is
largely
responsible
for
this
point
too
high
a
temperature
or
too
long
cooking
will
cause
the
custard
to
curdle
and
leave
the
edges
full
of
holes
a
smoother
texture
may
be
obtained
if
egg
yolks
alone
instead
of
the
yolks
and
whites
are
used
to
thicken
the
custard
the
proportions
given
in
the
accompanying
recipe
make
a
custard
of
very
good
texture
but
if
a
greater
proportion
of
eggs
is
used
the
result
will
be
a
firmer

gelatine
desserts
principles
of
gelatine
making
gelatine
desserts
are
those
in
which
gelatine
forms
the
basis
gelatine
is
an
odorless
tasteless
substance
extracted
from
the
bones
and
various
tissues
of
animals
it
is
used
in
a
variety
of
forms
such
as
glue
and
isinglass
but
is
also
purified
and
prepared
commercially
for
use
in
desserts
when
it
is
to
be
used
as
a
thickening
agent
in
dessert
making
it
is
ground
and
sold
in
this
form
or
it
is
mixed
with
sugar
flavoring
and
acid
when
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
it
an
appetizing
dessert
is
that
it
be
dissolved
in
hot
water
in
both
of
these
forms
it
is
sold
under
different
trade
names
the
gelatine
itself
does
not
provide
any
appreciable
food
value
but
it
is
a
means
of
conveying
various
foods
such
as
eggs
milk
sugar
and
many
kinds
of
fruit
and
fruit
juices
all
of
which
are
more
or
less
valuable
for
their
constituents
in
addition
it
produces
desserts
that
are
appetizing
and
that
may
be
garnished
and
served
in
many
attractive
ways
to
be
most
satisfactory
gelatine
desserts
should
usually
be
made
just
heavy
enough
with
gelatine
to
retain
the
desired
shape
the
heavier
they
become
the
more
rubbery
they
are
in
consistency
and
the
less
dainty
and
agreeable
their
consistency
can
be
regulated
by
the
proportion
of
liquid
to
gelatine
that
is
used
the
general
method
of
preparation
followed
when
plain
gelatine
is
used
in
desserts
consists
in
first
soaking
the
gelatine
in
sufficient
cold
water
to
moisten
it
then
dissolving
it
in
hot
liquid
as
near
the
boiling
point
as
possible
and
finally
cooling
it
in
order
to
allow
it
to
solidify
as
cold
is
absolutely
essential
for
the
mixture
to
solidify
it
is
often
difficult
to
prepare
a
gelatine
dessert
in
the
summer
time
therefore
when
a
dessert
of
this
kind
is
desired
in
the
warm
weather
it
should
always
be
begun
long
enough
before
it
is
to
be
served
to
allow
it
to
become
thoroughly
solid
as
it
is
usually
difficult
to
tell
how
much
time
this
requires
on
a
warm
day
even
with
a
refrigerator
or
other
cold
place
it
is
much
safer
to
overestimate
the
time
required
than
to
underestimate
it
boiling
does
not
as
was
formerly
thought
destroy
the
power
of
coagulation
in
gelatine
for
at
least
some
time
therefore
when
necessary
it
may
be
boiled
for
or
minutes
without
causing
any
change
one
fruit
that
will
prevent
gelatine
from
solidifying
however
is
raw
pineapple
this
is
an
important
point
to
remember
in
connection
with
gelatine
desserts
if
it
is
desired
to
use
fresh
pineapple
with
gelatine
it
will
first
be
necessary
to
bring
the
pineapple
to
the
boiling
point
in
order
to
destroy
the
property
that
prevents
the
gelatine
from
solidifying
the
proportion
of
liquid
to
gelatine
is
another
factor
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
successful
making
of
gelatine
desserts
this
differs
in
the
various
kinds
of
gelatine
but
the
proper
proportion
is
usually
stated
on
the
package
in
which
the
gelatine
comes
or
on
a

they

without

the
daintiest
dessert
that
can
be

and
are
popular
with
almost
every
one
a

ordinary
meal
becomes
much
more
attractive
when
a
frozen
dessert
is
served
with
it
and
a
dainty
luncheon
or
an

dinner
seems
incomplete
without
a
dessert
of
this
nature
in
reality
it
is
quite
impossible
to
serve
in
either
hot
or
cold
weather
any
dessert
that
is
as
pleasing
as
an
ice
or
an
ice

of
some
kind
in

being

it
will
therefore
not
be

matter
to
select

that
will
be
suitable
for
any
meal
in
which
it
may
be

the
preparation

however
need
not
be
confined
to
a
certain
limited
number
of
recipes
as
a
recipe
may
be
devised
to
suit
almost
any
occasion
or
condition
for
instance
if
there
are
certain
fruits
or
fruit
juices
in
supply
that
should
be
used
an
excellent
way
in
which
to
utilize
them
is
in
a
frozen
dessert
of
some
kind
after
a
little
experience
the
housewife
will
find
that
she
can
produce
excellent
results
by
merely
combining
the
ingredients
she
has
on
hand
or
those
corresponding
with
the
meal
in
which
the
frozen
dessert
is
to
be
served
the
food
value
of
frozen
desserts
varies
with
the
ingredients
used
in
their
preparation
it
being
extremely
high
in
some
and
very
low
in
others
therefore
the
particular
one
to
select
depends
somewhat
on
the
other
dishes
in
the
meal
on
the
whole
they
contain
very
healthful
ingredients
so
that
if
they
are
properly
made
they
may
have
a
place
in
the
diets
of
both
children
and
grown
ups
sick
persons
and
well
ones
whether
or
not
certain
individuals
should
eat
frozen
desserts
is
sometimes
a
troublesome
question
there
may
be
conditions
under
which
desserts
of
this
kind
should
not
be
included
in
the
diet
but
these
need
not
give
the
housewife
any
particular
concern
frozen
desserts
may
be
purchased
ready
made
but
those
made
in
the
home
cost
less
are
usually
more
delicious
and
can
be
prepared
in
greater
variety
as
they
are
not
difficult
to
make
and
are
not
necessarily
an
expensive
dessert
the
housewife
should
often
include
them
in
her
meals
therefore
an
freezer
of
a
size
that
will
accommodate
the
requirements
of
the
members
of
the
family
is
a
good
thing
to
add
to
the
cookery
equipment
ices
and
ice
creams
can
be
made
in
a
pail
that
has
a
cover
and
a
bail
such
as
a
lard
pail
but
this
is
not
a
very
convenient
equipment
and
does
not
produce
such
satisfactory
results
as
those
obtained
with
a
good
freezer
some
desserts
of
this
kind
may
be
frozen
without
the
use
of
a
freezer
but
as
a
rule
they
contain
materials
that
make
them
rather
expensive
theory
of
so
that
the
best
results
may
be
secured
in
the
making
of
frozen
desserts
it
is
well
that
the
theory
of
freezing
be
thoroughly
understood
the
two
things
necessary
for
the
freezing
of
such
desserts
are
ice
and
salt
when
these
are
brought
together
and
the
ice
melts
a
salt
solution
is
formed
since
salt
has
a
tendency
to
combine
with
moisture
whenever
they
come
in
contact
with
each
other
in
order
to
obtain
this
result
in
the
freezing
of
desserts
it
is
necessary
of
course
that
the
ice
be
melted
the
warmth
required
to
make
this
melting
possible
comes
from
the
contents
of
the
can
inside
the
freezer
when
this
warmth
is
absorbed
by
the
ice
the
cold
temperature
released
by
the
melting
of
the
ice
passes
into
the
mixture
the
result
is
that
the
ice
tends
to
become
liquid
and
the
contents
of
the
can
solid
by
the
exchange
of
temperatures
to
make
the
mixture
of
uniform
consistency
it
is
usually
agitated
by
means
of
a
dasher
during
the
freezing
process
this
incorporates
air
into
the
mixture
and
consequently
makes
it
light
and
increases
its

proportion
of
ice
to
the
ingredients
used
in
the
mixture
have
much
to
do
with
the
texture
of
the
ice
cream
when
it
is
frozen
for
instance
a
mixture
that
is
thin
and
composed
largely
of
water
will
not
have
so
smooth
a
consistency
when
frozen
as
a
heavier
mixture
in
which
cream
or
eggs
or
both
are
present
and
a
smaller
proportion
of
water
is
used
another
important
factor
in
the
texture
of
the
finished
product
is
the
proportion
of
ice
to
salt
for
this
has
much
to
do
with
the
length
of
time
required
for
freezing
the
mixture
the
smaller
the
proportion
of
salt
the
slower
will
be
the
freezing
process
for
the
melting
of
the
ice
takes
place
more
slowly
but
the
result
of
this
slow
freezing
is
a
finer
smoother
texture
granular
frozen
desserts
such
as
some
sherbets
and
frappés
are
frozen
with
a
large
proportion
of
salt
which
permits
the
freezing
to
take
place
more
quickly
on
this
rapidity
in
freezing
also
depends
to
a
large
extent
the
increase
in
quantity
that
takes
place
in
the
frozen
mixture
any
one
who
has
had
experience
in
making
ice
cream
knows
that
the
can
of
the
freezer
can
not
be
filled
before
the
freezing
is
begun
or
it
will
overflow
during
the
freezing
process
even
if
it
is
only
or
full
it
will
be
entirely
full
when
the
freezing
is
completed
this
increase
depends
somewhat
on
the
kind
of
mixture
as
has
been
stated
as
well
as
on
the
way
in
which
the
crank
of
the
freezer
is
turned
but
it
is
more
largely
determined
by
the
proportion
of
ice
and
salt
and
consequently
by
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
freezing
as
can
be
readily
understood
the
more
turning
that
is
done
the
greater
will
be
the
quantity
of
air
incorporated
into
the
mixture
and
naturally
the
more

procedure
in
freezing
desserts
the
preparation
of
frozen
desserts
is
comparatively
simple
in
nature
for
it
usually
involves
nothing
except
the
cooking
of
the
raw
ingredients
and
the
proper
combining
of
the
materials
required
in
the
recipe
sometimes
a
custard
mixture
containing
starch
is
prepared
and
other
times
a
real
custard
is
made
the
same
rules
that
apply
to
the
preparation
of
these
dishes
under
other
conditions
should
be
followed
here
as
the
housewife
is
already
familiar
with
these
principles
she
will
find
that
there
is
very
little
to
master
about
the
preparation
of
frozen
desserts
up
to
the
time
of
freezing
a
point
that
should
always
be
remembered
however
is
that
the
mixture
should
be
prepared
long
enough
before
the
freezing
to
be
entirely
cold
when
it
is
put
into
the
freezer
and
that
if
possible
it
should
be
cooled
in
a
refrigerator
no
trouble
will
be
experienced
in
preparing
enough
frozen
dessert
for
the
number
that
are
to
be
served
if
it
is
remembered
that
quart
of
unfrozen
mixture
will
serve
six
to
eight
persons
when
it
is
frozen
freezing
the
with
the
preparation
of
the
mixture
well
understood
the
housewife
should
turn
her
attention
to
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
its
freezing
as
has
been
explained
a
can
that
has
a
cover
and
a
bail
may
sometimes
be
used
especially
if
the
dessert
does
not
need
turning
but
a
freezer
is
necessary
for
good
results
in
the
preparation
of
a
frozen
dessert
that
requires
turning
in
the
case
of
those
that
need
no
turning
such
as
mousses
parfaits
a
mold
of
some
kind
or
a
vacuum
freezer
is
required
the
usual
type
of
freezer
consists
of
a
pail
generally
wooden
and
a
can
of
smaller
size
that
sets
inside
of
the
pail
the
space
between
the
can
and
the
pail
is
where
the
ice
and
salt
that
freeze
the
mixture
are
packed
the
can
which
is
the
container
for
the
mixture
contains
a
removable
dasher
that
is
turned
during
the
freezing
and
thus
beats
air
into
the
mixture
it
is
covered
with
a
top
that
has
an
opening
in
the
center
through
which
one
end
of
the
dasher
extends
and
a
ring
of
cogs
surrounding
this
opening
for
the
entire
freezer
there
is
a
top
piece
that
fastens
to
both
sides
of
the
wooden
bucket
it
contains
a
set
of
cogs
that
fit
into
the
cogs
on
the
cover
of
the
can
to
one
side
of
this
piece
is
attached
a
crank
which
upon
being
turned
moves
both
the
can
containing
the
mixture
and
the
dasher
inside
the
can
the
first
thing
to
be
done
in
the
freezing
of
any
dessert
is
to
get
the
ice
ready
for
use
this
may
be
done
in
numerous
ways
but
perhaps
the
most
convenient
one
is
shown
in
fig
a
bag
made
of
a
heavy
material
such
as
canvas
or
ticking
and
wooden
mallet
are
used
for
this
purpose
place
the
ice
in
the
bag
and
as
here
shown
hold
the
bag
shut
with
one
hand
and
pound
it
with
the
mallet
held
in
the
other
continue
the
pounding
until
the
ice
is
broken
into
small
pieces
and
then
empty
it
into
a
dishpan
or
some
other
large
pan
after
the
proportion
of
salt
to
ice
has
been
decided

philadelphia

perhaps
the
simplest
of
frozen
desserts
to
make
is
philadelphia
ice
cream
but
it
requires
cream
in
order
that
its
texture
be
good
for
this
reason
it
is
not
so
economical
as
some
of
those
which
are
a
trifle
more
complicated
to
prepare
it
consists
of
cream
sweetened
flavored
and
then
frozen
this
is
a
particularly
attractive
way
in
which
to
make
ice
cream
when
strawberries
red
raspberries
or
peaches
are
in
season
as
these
fresh
fruits
may
be
crushed
and
added
to
the
cream
instead
of
plain
flavoring
the
recipe
here
given
for
the
preparation
of
philadelphia
ice
cream
contains
vanilla
as
the
flavoring
but
fresh
fruit
of
any
desirable
kind
may
be
added
this
recipe
being
used
merely
as
a
basis
usually
cupfuls
of
crushed
fruit
is
required
for
a
quart
of
cream
it
is
necessary
however
to
vary
the
quantity
of
sugar
with
the
nature
of
the
fruit
used
for
instance
if
fresh
strawberries
are
used
more
sugar
will
be
required
than
if
canned
ones
are
used
because
sugar
has
already
been
added
to
these
the
best
plan
is
to
test
the
mixture
before
freezing
it
remembering
always
that
more

is

than
would
be

this
dessert

a
rather
extravagant
one

that
from

it
should
be
made
in
the

ices
ices
are
simple
mixtures
of
fruit
juice
and
sugar
diluted
with
water
and
then
frozen
they
are
expected
to
be
somewhat
sour
and
as
a
rule
lemon
juice
is
relied
on
to
assist
in
obtaining
this
flavor
in
addition
lemon
juice
also
helps
to
bring
out
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
used
as
the
basis
of
the
ice
as
a
rule
a
very
smooth
texture
is
not
desired
in
this
dessert
consequently
ice
is
frozen
quite
rapidly
and
as
will
be
noted
in
table
i
with
a
high
proportion
of
salt
unless
the
fruit
used
in
an
ice
is
expensive
this
is
probably
the
cheapest
frozen
dessert
that
can
be
made
for
it
seldom
contains
any
other
ingredients
than
those
mentioned
it
is
usually
clear
but
occasionally
the
fruit
pulp
is
used
in
addition
to
the
fruit
juice
when
this
is
done
the
mixture
should
not
be
frozen
too
hard
as
the
fruit
is
apt
to
become
icy
fresh
canned
or
preserved
fruit
may
be
used
the
sugar
used
for
ices
is
usually
cooked
with
the
water
to
form
a
sirup
otherwise
the
sugar
often
fails
to
dissolve
and
remains
granular
preventing
the
ice
from
being
as
sweet
as
it
should
be
for
the
amount
of
sugar
used
lemon
the
ice
most
frequently
made
is
that
flavored
with
lemon
it
is
very
refreshing
when
served
plain
but
it
can
be
improved
by
the
addition
of
fruit
a
very
delightful
way
in
which
to
serve
it
is
to
place
a
large
spoonful
in
a
sherbet
glass
pour
over
this
a
spoonful
or
two
of

frappés
in
composition
are
very
similar
to
ices
consisting
usually
of
crushed
fruit
or

they
are
granular
when
frozen
and
as
they
are
never
frozen
as
hard
as
ice
cream
and
ices
they
are
of
a
mushy
consistency
they
are
more
often
used
for
serving
with
a
heavy
course
in
a
dinner
or
between
two
courses
than
as
a
dessert
the
freezing
of
frappés
is
accomplished
rapidly
for
as
will
be
observed
from
table
i
the
proportion
of
ice
and
salt
used
is
to
this
together
with
the
fact
that
the
mixture
contains
a
large
proportion
of
water
accounts
for
the
granular
nature
of
frappés
any
desirable
fruit
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
this
dessert
if
it
is
a
rather
bland
fruit
such
as
peaches
raspberries
lemon
juice
should
be
added
in
order
to
give

nature
of
mousses
parfaits
and

mousses
parfaits
and
biscuits
differ
from
other
frozen
desserts
in
that
they
are
frozen
in
molds
rather
than
in
a
freezer
mousses
and
parfaits
are
similar
in
nature
and
still
there
is
a
slight
distinction
between
them
mousses
nearly
always
contain
gelatine
and
are
frequently
made
without
eggs
while
parfaits
are
composed
largely
of
sirup
eggs
and
cream
biscuits
are
usually
made
of
a
mixture
similar
to
mousses
and
parfaits
but
are
molded
in
individual
molds
since
the
desserts
are
frozen
without
being
turned
they
must
be
of
a
heavy
smooth
texture
so
that
they
will
not
be
granular
when
they
are
frozen
as
would
be
the
case
if
a
fine
mixture
were
packed
in
a
mold
and
frozen
without
turning
in
many
of
them
whipped
cream
and
beaten
eggs
are
folded
in
to
give
lightness
in
the
ordinary
manner
of
freezing
this
lightness
would
be
lost
but
it
is
retained
in
this
method
because
the
mixture
is
undisturbed
during
the
freezing
process
considerable
time
is
required
to
freeze
these
heavy
mixtures
in
fact
if
a
mousse
contains
too
large
a
proportion
of
gelatine
there
is
difficulty
in
freezing
it
at
all
molding
mousses
parfaits
and
the
molding
of
mousses
parfaits
and
biscuits
while
different
from
the
freezing
of
other
frozen
desserts
is
not
a
difficult
matter
they
are
usually
put
in
a
mold
of
some
kind
and
the
mold
is
then
covered
with
a
mixture
of
ice
and
salt
after
the
mixture
is
prepared

ice

then

it

often
to
improve
the
appearance
the
mold
is
first
lined
with
a
frappé
or
an
ice
and
then
filled
with
the
heavier
mixture
such
an
arrangement
provides
an
opportunity
for
a
color
scheme
and
at
the
same
time
facilitates
the
removal
of
the
dessert
from
the
mold
with
the
mold

in
the
desired
way
wrap
several
layers
of
oiled

cake
is
a

of
flour

sugar
butter
and
liquid
that
is
baked
in
the
oven
in
a
variety
of
forms
and
distinguished

and

flavor
closely
allied
to

mixtures
proper
are
many
others
including

cakes
puddings
etc
while
these
differ
from
cakes
in
some
respects
they
are
similar
in
use
ingredients
or
methods
of
preparation
because
of
this
similarity
a
number
of
these
related
mixtures
are
taken
up
in
connection
with
cakes
foods
of
this
class
which
are
usually
served
as
dessert
are
for
the
most
part
considered
as
luxuries
and
of
course
are
not
used
so
extensively
in
the
diet
as
other
classes
of
foods
however
sweet
food
is
required
to
a
certain
extent
in
each
person
diet
and
it
may
be
obtained
in
this
agreeable
form
without
overbalancing
the
food
account
if
a
little
economy
is
practiced
elsewhere
thus
a
small
quantity
of
cake
or
pudding
that
is
light
not
too
rich
and
properly
made
may
be
served
without
injury
to
most
persons
as
a
dessert
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
dessert
for
children
the
less
rich
and
sweet
mixtures
such
as
cookies
are
preferable
to
rich
cake
and
very
sweet
confections
and
may
be
fed
to
them
occasionally
because
of
the
almost
unlimited
variation
in
the
proportion
of
ingredients
considerable
variety
exists
in
desserts
of
this
kind
cakes
range
from
those
made
with
only
eggs
for
leavening
to
those
containing
very
few
eggs
and
having
the
standard
proportion
of
other
leavening
agents
for
instance
there
is
sponge
cake
which
contains
no
shortening
and
no
leavening
except
eggs
in
contrast
with
butter
cake
which
has
much
shortening
or
little
as
the
case
may
be
and
requires
proportionate
quantities
of
flour
and
leavening
other
than
eggs
then
there
are
soft
rich
cookies
containing
shortening
and
sugar
and
the
harder
less
rich
ones
containing
a
greater
proportion
of
flour
in
addition
to
cakes
and
puddings
proper
there
are
many
mixtures
that
can
scarcely
be
classed
as
cakes
at
all
a
few
of
them
such
as
meringues
are
so
sweet
and
delicate
that
they
could
be
considered
as
confections
but
they
are
discussed
in
connection
with
cakes
because
they
take
the
place
of
cake
in
the
meal
the
peculiar
pastes
used
for
the
making
of
cream
puffs
and
éclairs
are
not
in
reality
cakes
nor
are
they
real
pastry
but
because
they
are
served
as
desserts
and
belong
somewhere
in
this
class
they
are
included
here
doughnuts
and
crullers
are
perhaps
more
often
thought
of
as
quick
breads
than
as
cakes
however
the
mixtures
used
for
them
are
sweet
they
differ
from
the
mixtures
for
cakes
only
in
being
less
rich
but
by
the
peculiar
method
of
their
preparation
in
deep
fat
these
foods
become
richer
than
the
majority
of
cakes
then
there
are
a
few
varieties
of
cakes
made
with
yeast
which
are
related
to
cake
in
some
respects
and
can
well
be
taken
up
in
this
connection
the
proportions
of
liquid
to
flour
for
the
various
kinds
of
cake
mixtures
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
of
the
batters
and
doughs
given
in
still
the
increased
amount
of
sugar
eggs
and
shortening
must
always
be
considered
for
these
ingredients
make
considerable
variation
in
the
general
proportions
all
that
is
said
in
concerning
leavening
agents
and
the
proportions
in
which
they
are
used
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
making
of
cakes
to
be
able
to
make
foods
of
this
nature
well
is
one
of
the
triumphs
of
the
modern
housewife
but
this
accomplishment
is
not
beyond
the
limitations
of
any
woman
who
masters
the
principles
of
cookery
and
diligently
applies
them
to
this
part
of
the
subject
in
addition
to
making
desserts
that
are
merely
palatable
she

with

little
practice
learn

cakes
both
attractively

ingredients
used
in
cakes
necessary
ingredients
quality
of
the
materials
used
in
the
making
of
cakes
should
be
of
as
good
quality
as
possible
and
when
put
into
the
cake
they
should
be
in
the
best
condition
in
this
phase
of
cookery
as
in
all
others
better
results
are
obtained
when
good
materials
are
used
besides
possessing
this
general
characteristic
certain
of
the
ingredients
require
special
attention
fat
for
the
fat
used
for
cakes
must
necessarily
be
of
an
agreeable
flavor
and
for
this
reason
butter
is
the
kind
in
general
use
there
are
of
course
other
fats
that
may
be
used
to
advantage
either
as
part
or
all
of
the
fat
required
however
when
another
fat
is
to
take
the
place
of
butter
one
that
is
practically
flavorless
should
be
chosen
oleomargarine
of
various
kinds
crisco
and
even
some
of
the
liquid
fats
are
very
satisfactory
especially
in
the
making
of
cookies
sweetening
for
numerous
varieties
of
sugar
may
be
employed
in
the
making
of
cakes
probably
granulated
sugar
is
used
more
frequently
than
any
other
but
brown
sugar
soft
sugar
and
confectioner
sugar
all
have
a
place
in
cake
making
any
of
these
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
icing
as
well
as
for
an
ingredient
of
the
cake
itself
leavening
for
an
important
source
of
leavening
in
cakes
is
eggs
for
cakes
to
be
most
satisfactory
the
eggs
employed
should
be
strictly
fresh
during
the
season
when
they
are
scarce
and
consequently
high
in
price
recipes
that
require
only
a
few
eggs
should
be
prepared
baking
powder
which
is
also
an
important
leavening
in
cakes
should
be
of
an
approved
brand
that
can
be
relied
on
to
do
the
work
expected
of
it
soda
and
cream
of

are
sometimes
used
together
and
again

is
used

the
baking
powder
called
for

altitude
affects
the
amount
of
baking
powder
required
in
cakes
the
quantity
given
in
the
recipes
is
correct
for
altitudes
varying
from
sea
level
to
mile
high
but
it
should
be
reduced
at
an
elevation
of
mile
and
at
an
elevation
of
feet
liquid
for
milk
as
a
rule
is
the
liquid
used
in
cake
making
it
may
be
skim
milk
or
whole
milk
it
may
consist
of
part
water
and
part
milk
or
it
may
be
entirely
water
depending
on
the
kind
of
cake
when
a
large
number
of
eggs
are
used
in
a
cake
very
little
liquid
is
employed
sometimes
the
liquid
consists
of
molasses
and
sour
milk
used
together
separately
or
with
some
other
liquid
flour
for
the
flour
used
in
the
preparation
of
cakes
may
be
bread
pastry
or
blend
flour
depending
on
the
kind
of
cake
desired
while
a
blend
or
an
flour
makes
a
satisfactory
cake
pastry
flour
which
is
milled
from
soft
winter
wheat
or
better
still
cake
flour
is
more
nearly
ideal
as
the
excess
gluten
is
removed
and
it
is
much
finer
milled
hence
it
produces
a
lighter
finer
more
delicate
cake
wheat
flour
is
the
kind
that
is
generally
used
but
other
flours
such
as
white
corn
meal
rice
flour
and
potato
flour
though
producing
a
drying
effect
are
sometimes
combined
with
wheat
a
tablespoonful
of
corn
starch
sifted
with
the
bread
or
hard
wheat
flour
is
an
improvement
over
straight
bread
flour
but
as
it
has
a
drying
effect
it
is
not
to
be
recommended
miscellaneous
ingredients
in
addition
to
the
ingredients
that
have
just
been
mentioned
there
are
numerous
other
ingredients
that
are
often
used
in
cakes
some
of
them
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
adding
flavor
and
variety
to
otherwise
plain
cakes
while
many
of
them
are
used
entirely
for
the
purpose
of
flavoring
these
ingredients
like
the
necessary
ones
should
be
of
excellent
quality
it
is
essential
that
their
use
and
value
be
understood
for
by
means
of
them
pleasing
variety
may
often
be
secured
with
just
a
recipe
for
instance
a
plain
cake
as
a
foundation
may
be
varied
by
using
with
it
raisins
nuts
spices
coconut
preserved
fruits
of
various
kinds
or
flavoring
of
some
sort
to
be
able
to
use
these
ingredients
properly
it
is
well
for
the
housewife
to
be
familiar
with
their
nature
and
the
treatment
that
must
be
given
to
them
before
they
can
be
used
currants
and
as
has
already
been
learned
currants
and
raisins
are
varieties
of
dried
grapes
currants
do
not
contain
seeds
but
raisins
come
in
both
seeded
and
seedless
varieties
and
either
of
these
are
satisfactory
for
cake
making
currants
are
often
dry
and
hard
and
as
they
are
usually
very
dirty
they
require
considerable
cleaning
to
prevent
them
from
being
gritty
when
the
cake
is
eaten
because
of
these
facts
currants
are
not
very
satisfactory
and
consequently
are
usually
replaced
by
raisins
which
may
be
used
either
chopped
or
whole
for
any
of
the
purposes
currants
are
used
if
small
raisins
are
desired
sultanas
which
are
a
small
and
variety
are
the
best
to
purchase
these
two
fruits
increase
the
food
value
of
the
mixtures
to
which
they
are
added
raisins
being
extremely
high
in
carbohydrate
are
especially
valuable
as
an
ingredient
before
currants
and
raisins
are
used
in
cake
mixtures
they
should
be
thoroughly
cleaned
to
clean
them
place
them
in
a
colander
and
then
turn
a
stream
of
cold
water
over
them
and
rub
them
between
the
fingers
until
all
dirt
or
other
foreign
material
is
removed
when
clean
allow
them
to
dry
as
thoroughly
as
possible
before
using
them
miscellaneous
fruits
other
than
currants
and
raisins
are
often
used
in
the
preparation
of
cakes
and
puddings
these
which
may
be
dried
canned
or
preserved
include
dates
figs
citron
apricots
prunes
cherries
plums
pears
peaches
and
pineapple
candied
orange
and
lemon
peel
are
generally
used
in
the
preparation
of
fruit
cake
all
of
these
fruits
add
food
value
and
flavor
a
certain
amount
of
preparation
must
be
given
to
fruits
before
they
can
be
used
in
cakes
all
of
them
except
the
canned
fruits
must
be
thoroughly
washed
and
some
of
them
such
as
dates
must
have
the
stones
removed
those
which
are
very
hard
as
for
instance
figs
and
citron
may
be
steamed
to
make
them
soft
the
steaming
may
be
done
by
placing
the
fruit
in
a
colander
over
a
vessel
of
boiling
water
and
covering
the
colander
to
retain
the
steam
when
treated
in
this
manner
these
fruits
will
cut
more
easily
and
will
be
softer
and
more
moist
in
the
finished
cake
in
the
making
of
cakes
nuts
of
almost
any
variety
may
be
utilized
not
only
do
they
add
a
large
amount
of
food
value
in
the
form
of
fat
but
they
increase
the
richness
of
the
cake
and
provide
a
very
delightful
flavor
the
nut
meats
are
generally
too
large
in
size
to
be
used
whole
and
so
they
must
be
made
smaller
before
they
are
added
to
the
mixture
they
may
be
put
through
a
chopper
but
usually
it
is
preferable
to
chop
them
with
a
chopping
knife
in
a
bowl
or
cut
them
into
pieces
with
a
paring
knife
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
the
use
of
nuts
in
a
cake
adds
greatly
to
the
cost
for
with
the
exception
of
peanuts
they
are
rather
expensive
particularly
when
they
are
bought
shelled
as
can
readily
be
understood
both
the
nuts
themselves
and
the
labor
involved
in
removing
the
shells
must
be
paid
for
the
cost
of
course
may
be
reduced
by
buying
the
nuts
in
the
shells
and
shelling
them
at
home
the
flesh
of
the
coconut
when
shredded
is
much
used
in
the
preparation
of
cakes
being
put
in
the
cake
mixture
or
used
in
connection
with
icing
between
the
layers
and
over
the
top
layer
coconut
may
be
purchased
already
shredded
in
boxes
or
cans
or
it
may
be
obtained
in
the
shells
and
then
shredded
at
home
that
which
is
prepared
commercially
either
is
dried
when
it
will
be
found
to
be
somewhat
hard
or
is
mixed
with
the
milk
of
the
coconut
or
with
glycerine
which
keeps
it
soft
much
more
satisfactory
coconut
can
be
secured
by
procuring
a
coconut
cracking
open
the
shell
removing
the
flesh
and
then
grating
or
grinding
it
coconut
of
this
kind
will
be
found
to
be
very
delicious
and
will
make
excellent
cake
in
case
coconut
becomes
dry
and
hard
before
it
is
used
it
can
be
softened
by
steaming
it
in
the
manner
in
which
dried
fruits
are
steamed
chocolate
and
materials
that
are
much
used
for
flavoring

are
chocolate
and
cocoa
chocolate
is
sold
in
pound
and
cakes
in
both
the
bitter
and
the
sweetened
form
while
cocoa
is
sold
in
packages
or
bottles
in
powder
form
the
bitter
chocolate
gives
the
greatest
amount
of
food
value
and
flavor
and
is
therefore
used
the
most
cocoa
is
neither
so
strong
in
flavor
nor
so
high
in
food
value
as
chocolate
but
it
can
be
substituted
for
chocolate
when
this
is
not
in

in
many
kinds
of

spices
are
needed
to
give
the
desired
flavor
when
they
are
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
they
should
be
obtained
in
the
ground
form
and
then
mixed
with
the
dry
ingredients
the
principal
varieties
used
in
cakes
are
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
and
allspice
sometimes
a
combination
of
all
these
is
added
to
the
mixture
but
very
often
just
a
little
cinnamon
or
a
mild
flavoring
of
nutmeg
is
all
that
is
required
when
spices
are
purchased
the
best
possible
brands
should
be
selected
because
these
things
are
very
easily
adulterated
with
other
materials
and
adulterated
spices
have
not
so
much
strength
as
the
better
kinds
flavoring
in
cake
preparation
almost
more
than
in
any
other
part
of
cookery
flavoring
extracts
have
a
place
they
are
used
in
plain
cakes
that
do
not
contain
any
of
the
other
miscellaneous
ingredients
and
some
of
them
are
also
added
to
many
cake
mixtures
and
icings
that
contain
fruits
nuts
spices
chocolate
etc
vanilla
which
is
an
alcoholic
extract
of
the
vanilla
bean
is
probably
used
more
frequently
than
any
other
flavoring
the
alcoholic
extracts
of
orange
lemon
almond
pistachio
and
various
other
flavors
are
also
valuable
in
cake
making
when
any
of
these
flavorings
are
used
in
cakes
it
should
be
remembered
that
much
of
their
strength
is
lost
through
the
baking
therefore
in
order
that
the
cake
may
be
well
flavored
after
it
is
baked
a
comparatively
large
quantity
of
flavoring
must
be
used
general
classes
of
cakes
although
many
varieties
of
cake
can
be
made
they
may
all
be
put
into
two
general
classes
and
these
classes
may
also
be
regarded
as
cake
made
without
butter
and
cake
made
with
butter
for
it
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
fat
in
a
cake
mixture
that
makes
the
difference
in
the
method
of
mixing
the
ingredients
and
determines
the
texture
after
baking
while
there
are
many
true
examples
of
each
of
these
classes
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
are
also
numerous
variations
of
the
two
which
must
be
placed
in
either
one
or
the
other
of
these
classes
for
instance
a
true
sponge
cake
does
not
contain
baking
powder
but
some
recipes
for
sponge
cake
are
given
in
which
baking
powder
is
included
such
recipes
must
be
regarded
as
variations
of
sponge
cake
for
they
are
more
similar
to
that
than
to
butter
cake
the
ingredients
are
not
however
the
only
source
of
difference
between
these
two
general
classes
of
cakes
they
also
differ
as
to
the
method
used
to
combine
the
ingredients
the
correct
oven
temperature
for
baking
and
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
baking
all
these
differences
must
be
thoroughly
understood
if
successful
cake
making
is
to
be
the
result
general
equipment
for
cake
making
the
different
forms
of
cake
require
of
course
different
utensils
and
these
are
taken
up
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
each
class
however
it
is
well
for
the
housewife
to
be
familiar
at
the
outset
with
the
general
equipment
used
in
the
making
of
cakes
and
similar
foods
the
utensils
required
for
the
mixing
of
the
ingredients
are
somewhat
similar
to
those
used
in
the
preparation
of
hot
breads
an
earthen
bowl
is
preferable
for
the
mixing
of
the
batter
if
this
kind
is
not
available
an
enamel
one
rather
than
an
aluminum
one
should
be
used
when
cake
dough
is
stirred
in
an
aluminum
dish
the
sides
usually
become
darkened
and
are
liable
to
discolor
the
mixture
spoons
for
the
mixing
of
the
ingredients
are
also
important
enameled
spoons
are
not
very
satisfactory
because
the
enamel
is
likely
to
chip
off
the
edges
aluminum
spoons
may
be
used
in
fact
they
have
lightness
in
weight
which
recommends
their
use
but
if
much
stirring
is
done
a
slight
discoloration
is
apt
to
occur
from
the
spoon
wooden
spoons
or
spatulas
are
found
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
for
this
purpose
they
are
light
in
weight
cause
no
discoloration
and
do
not
chip
nor
wear
off
two
measuring
cups
one
for
the
dry

of

in
cake
making
as
in
the
preparation
of
other
dishes
a
systematic
plan
must
be
followed
if
good
results
are
desired
a
housewife
can
not
expect
to
have
a
successful
cake
if
she
has
to
stop
during
the
mixing
to
get
some
of
the
ingredients
or
some
of
the
utensils
ready
before
the
mixing
is
begun
all
the
utensils
and
ingredients
should
be
collected
and
any
of
the
ingredients
that
require
special
preparation
should
be
prepared
then
if
the
recipe
is
correct
if
the
ingredients
are
measured
accurately
and
combined
correctly
and
if
the
baking
is
done
properly
success
in
cake
making
is
assured
the
first
thing
to
be
done
when
a
cake
is
to
be
made
is
to
read
the
recipe
to
determine
just
what
is
required
and
to
find
out
whether
all
the
ingredients
called
for
are
in
supply
with
this
done
all
the
utensils
should
be
placed
conveniently
on
the
table
and
the
ingredients
collected
and
measured
some
authorities
advise
the
weighing
of
the
ingredients
in
cake
because
weight
is
always
regarded
as
more
accurate
than
measure
if
a
recipe
calls
for
weights
it
will
be
found
easier
to
use
them
than
to
try
to
change
them
to
measure
but
when
a
recipe
requires
measures
and
does
not
state
weights
it
would
be
unwise
to
attempt
to
use
scales
for
measuring
the
measuring
of
the
fat
often
requires
a
little
attention
for
instance
if
only
cupful
of
butter
or
some
other
fat
is
required
it
may
perhaps
be
more
convenient
to
measure
it
with
a
tablespoon
than
with
a
cup
otherwise
unless
the
recipe
calls
for
melted
fat
the
fat
should
be
measured
by
pressing
it
down
tight
into
the
cup
until
it
reaches
the
mark
indicating
the
required
amount
if
the
fat
is
hard
and
cold
as
is
usually
the
case
when
it
is
first
taken
from
the
refrigerator
or
other
cold
place
it
will
be
difficult
to
cream
a
good
plan
is
to
let
the
fat
stand
until
it
is
degrees

granulated
sugar
seldom
requires
any
preparation
except
measuring
however
sugar
other
than

particularly
brown
sugar

pulverized
sugar
should
be
rolled
with
a
rolling
pin
and
then
sifted
in

to
free
it
from
any
lumps

might
contain

dry
ingredients
if
the
dry
leavening
agent
appears
to
be
lumpy
when
the
cover
is
removed
from

it
should
be
worked
smooth

spoon
and
sifted
before
it
is
measured
a
very
small
mesh
wire
sieve
may
be
used

the
cup
stationary

to
the
top
can
be
gathered
however
fats
that
are
less
expensive
than

are
perfectly
satisfactory
for
greasing

and
so

should
not
be
used
unless

muffin

a

it
is
not
recommended
as
the

is
apt
to
become
rancid
in

if

as
often
as
is
necessary
to
keep
it
in

a

will
be
wasted

several
tests
to

one
of
these
consists
in
observing
the

rise
a

loosen
the

another
test
which
is
known
as
the
finger
test
consists
in
making
a
depression
in
the
center
of

if
the

butter
cake
the
surface
springs
back
to
fill
the
depression
it
may
be
known
that
the

is
done
another
test
consists
in
inserting
a
toothpick
in
the
center
of
the
cake
if
it
comes
out
clean
the
cake
has
finished
baking
but
if
some
of
the

sticks
to
the
toothpick
more
baking
is
required
care
of
butter
cake
after
as
soon
as
a
butter
cake
is
sufficiently
baked
take
it
from
the
oven
and
remove
it
from
the
pan
at
once
see
that
the
cake
is
loosened
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
pan
before
attempting
to
turn
it
out
it
can
be
loosened
around
the
sides
by
means
of
a
knife
and
usually
a
slight
shaking
of
the
pan
up
and
down
or
the
inserting
of
the
knife
a
little
under
the
cake
will
be
sufficient
to
loosen
it
from
the
bottom
here
the
advantage
of
pans
having
removable
bottoms
is
evident
when
such
pans
are
used
lift
the
cake
out
of
the
pan
on
the
removable
bottom
and
as
shown
in
fig
run
a
long
thin
knife
under
the
cake
until
it
is
entirely
loosened
from
the
pan
then
slip
the
bottom
out
from
under
the
cake
and
allow
the
cake
to
cool
a
cake
cooler
such
as
the
one
here
shown
is
the
most
convenient
thing
to
use
for
the
cooling
of
cakes
if
one
of
these
is
not
available
clean
towels
spread
on
a
flat
surface
make
a
very
good
substitute
allow
the

fruit
cake
usually
has
an
important
place
but
besides

very
appropriate
cake
for

season
fruit
cake
is
a
splendid
cake
to
make
because
of
its
keeping
qualities
it
may
be
kept
for
a
long
time
if

is
properly
cared

the
best
plan
is
to
wrap
it

put
it
away
in

better

these

are
used
for
the

both
the

the
appearance
of

as
well
as

simple

merely

the
cake
that
comes
out

smooth
surface
is
the
one
to
which
an
icing

applied
most
satisfactorily
unless
absolutely
necessary
the
cake
should
not
be
cut
nor
broken
in
any
way
before
it
is
iced
as
a
cut
surface
is
apt
to
crumble
and

a
rough
appearance
if
the
cake
must
be
cut
as
is
the
case
when
small
fancy
shapes
are
made
out
of
baked
cake
the
pieces
should
be
glazed
with
a
coating
of
egg
white
mixed
with
a
very
small
quantity

just
enough
to

hours

icings
and
their
preparation
varieties
of
icings
are
of
two
varieties
those
which
require
cooking
and
those
whose
ingredients
are
not
cooked
in
uncooked
icings
which
are
easily
made
sugar
such
as
confectioner
is
moistened
with
a
liquid
of
some
kind
and
then
flavored
in
various
ways
the
more
common
of
the
cooked
varieties
are
made
by
beating
a
hot
sugar
sirup
into
egg
whites
after
being
flavored
icings
of
this
kind
may
be
used
without
the
addition
of
other
ingredients
or
they
may
be
combined
with
fruits
nuts
coconut
etc
uncooked
confectioner
sugar
is
the
most
satisfactory
for
uncooked
icings
and
it
is
the
kind
most
commonly
used
for
this
purpose
the
finer
this
sugar
can
be
secured
the
better
will
the
icing
be
xxxx
being
the
most
desirable
as
such
sugar
forms
very
hard
lumps
when
it
is
allowed
to
stand
it
should
be
rolled
and
sifted
before
it
is
mixed
with
the
other
ingredients
the
material
used
to
moisten
the
sugar
may
be
lemon
juice
or
some
other
fruit
juice
water
milk
cream
egg
white
butter
or
a
combination
of
these
enough
liquid
should
be
used
to
make
the
icing
thin
enough
to
spread
easily
the
ingredients
used
in
uncooked
icings
determine
to
a
certain
extent
the
utensils
required
to
make
the
icings
a
wire
sifter
should
be
used
to
sift
the
sugar
a
bowl
of
the
proper
size
to
mix
the
materials
should
be
selected
and
a
wooden
spoon
should
also
be
secured
for
this
purpose
although
a
silver
spoon
will
answer
if
a
wooden
one
is
not
in
supply
to
spread
the
mixture
on
the
cake
a
silver
knife
produces
the
best
results
if
the

to
be

a

cooked
icings
are

for
the

icings
of
this
kind
consist
of
a
sugar
sirup
beaten
into
egg
whites
that
have
been
whipped
until
they
are
stiff
success
in
making
icing
of
this
kind
depends
largely
on
boiling
the
sirup
to
just
the
right
degree
for
when
this
is
done
the
icing
will
remain
for
a
short
time
in
a
condition
to
be
handled
if
the
sirup
is
not
cooked
long
enough
the
icing
will
not
stiffen
and
it
will
have
to
be
mixed
with
powdered
sugar
to
make
it
dry
in
the
event
of
its
being
boiled
too
long
the
icing
will
have
to
be
applied
quickly
for
it
is
likely
to
become
sugary
a
thermometer
is
a
convenient
utensil
to
use
in
making
icings
of
this
kind
for
with
it
the
housewife
can
determine
just
when
the
sirup
is
boiled
to
the
right
point
however
after
the
housewife
has
had
a
little
experience
excellent
results
can
be
achieved
in
the
way
of
icings
without
a
thermometer
if
the
mixture
is
tested
carefully
the
beating
of
cooked
icings
also
has
much
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
finished
product
they
should
be
beaten
until
they
are
of
just
the
proper
consistency
to
spread
and
still
will
not
run
off
the
surface
of
the
cake
because
of
the
nature
of
cooked
icings
it
is
necessary
that
the
work
of
applying
them
to
cakes
be
completed
as
quickly
as
possible
a
case
knife
or
a
spatula
is
the
best
utensil
for
this
purpose
to
ice
a

pour
some
of
the
icing
on
the
layer
that
is
desired
for
the
bottom
and
then
spread
it
over

quickly
until
it
is
smooth
and
as
thick
as
desired
if
coconut
or
any
other
ingredient
such
as
chopped
nuts
or
fruit
is
to
be
used
sprinkle
it
on
the

as
in

then
take
up
the
second

carefully
as
shown
and
place
it
on
the
iced

pour
the
remainder
of
the
icing
on
this
layer
and
spread
it
evenly
over
the
top
and
down
the
sides
as
shown
in
fig
the
cake
will
then
be
covered
with
a
plain
white
icing
that
will
be
sufficient
in
itself
or
that
may
serve
as
a
basis
for
any
desired
ornament
if

have

the

can
select
the
one
that
seems
best

to
the

with
which
it
is
to
be
used
as
will
be
noted
many
of

are
similar
to

cakes
must

enough
to

layer
and
then

connection
with
the

themselves
when
the
majority

cookies
classes
of
cookies
are
of
two
general
classes
those
which
are
made
thick
and
are
expected
to
be
soft
when
they
are
served
and
those
which
are
made
thin
and
are
intended
to
be
crisp
and
brittle
when
eaten
thin
crisp
cookies
are
usually
known
as
or
soft
cookies
are
made
from
a
dough
that
contains
a
little
more
liquid
than
that
used
for
brittle
cookies
the
dough
of
which
both
varieties
are
made
should
be
thick
enough
to
remove
from
the
mixing
bowl
in
a
lump
and
roll
out
on
a
board
after
being
rolled
until
it
is
the
desired
thickness
it
is
cut
into
pieces
of
any
desired
size
and
shape
and
baked
in
the
oven
on
large
flat
pans
illustration
fig
ingredients
in
the
ingredients
used
in
the
making
of
cookies
are
similar
to
those
used
for
drop
cakes
with
the
exception
of
the
amount
of
flour
in
fact
any
cooky
mixture
that
is
made
a
little
more
moist
by
omitting
some
of
the
flour
may
be
used
for
drop
cakes
more
flour
is
needed
in
cooky
mixtures
because
they
must
be
of
a
certain
thickness
in
order
to
be
rolled
out
successfully
the
amount
of
flour
needed
varies
with
the
kind
that
is
used
more
of
some
varieties
of
this
ingredient
being
required
than
of
others
it
is
usually
advisable
to
add
the
last
cup
of
flour
with
caution
if
the
mixture
seems
to
be
getting
stiff
before
all
the
flour
is
added
what
is
not
needed
should
be
omitted
but
if
it
does
not
become
stiff
enough
to
handle
more
should
be
added
considerable
variety
exists
in
the
shortening
that
may
be
used
in
cooky
mixtures
if
desired
butter
may
be
used
but
for
most
cookies
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
that
the
shortening
consist
entirely
of
butter
and
for
some
no
butter
at
all
is
required
other
fats
and
oils
such
as
lard
crisco
lard
compound
mazola
cottoline
butterine
and
any
other
tasteless
shortening
may
be
substituted
for
all
or
part
of
the
butter
any
of
the
following
cooky
recipes
that
contain
butter
do
so
because
that
particular
cooky
or
cake
is
better
when
made
with
butter
but
if
desired
some
other
fat
may
be
used
for
a
part
or
all
of
it
in
case
merely
shortening
is
mentioned
any
fat
or
mixture
of
fats
preferred
may
be
used
procedure
in
making
the
combining
of
the
ingredients
in
cooky
mixtures
need
give
the
housewife
very
little
concern
for
it
is
accomplished
in
much
the
same
way
as
for
cup
and
drop
cakes
when
all
of
them
have
been
combined
a
dough
that
is
stiff
enough
to
handle
and
still
not
so
stiff
that
it
is
tough
should
be
formed
the
chief
precaution
to
be
taken
in
the
making
of
all
kinds
of
cookies
is
to
avoid
getting
too
much
flour
into
the
mixture
to
produce
the
best
results
the
mixture
should
be
so
soft
that
it
is
difficult
to
handle
a
good
plan
is
to
allow
it
to
become
very
cold
for
then
it
will
be
much
stiffer
and
may
be
handled
more
easily
therefore
after
the
dough
has
been
mixed
it
is
well
to
set
it
in
a
refrigerator
or
some
other
cool
place
and
let
it
stand
for
several
hours
before
attempting
to
roll
it
in
fact
a
cooky
mixture
may
be
made
in
the
evening
and
allowed
to
stand
until
the
next
morning
before
being
rolled
out
and
baked
as
can
readily
be
understood
such
procedure
is
possible
with
a
stiff
mixture
like
that
for
cookies
while
it
would
not
be
practicable
with
a
thin
mixture
such
as
cake
batter
because
the
gas
that
is
formed
by
the
leavening
agent
would
escape
from
a
mixture
that
is
not
thick
and
the
cake
after
being
baked
would
have
no
lightness
with
the
dough
ready
to
be
rolled
divide
it
into
amounts
of
a
size
that
can
be
handled
conveniently
at
one
time
take
one
of
these
from
the
mixing
bowl
and
place
it
on
a
board
work
it
with
the
fingers
into
a
flat
round
piece
using
a
little
flour
on
the
fingers
during
this
process
dust
the
top
lightly
with
flour
and
by
means
of
a
rolling
pin
roll
the
dough
into
a
flat
piece
that
is
as
nearly
round
as
possible
continue
rolling
with
a
short
light
stroke
until
the
dough
is
as
thin
as
desired
remember
that
light
careful
handling
is
always
necessary
when
any
kind
of
dough
mixture
is
rolled
on
the
board
and
that
as
little
handling
as
possible
is
advisable
skill
in
this
respect
will
come
with
practice
so
the
housewife
need
not
be
discouraged
if
she
has
difficulty

necessary
from

to

no
more
flour
should
be
used
than

kisses

nature
of
kisses
and
the
varieties
of
small
cakes
known
as
kisses
and
macaroons
are
undoubtedly
the
daintiest
ones
that
are
made
composed
almost
entirely
of
sugar
egg
whites
and
flavoring
they
are
very
delicate
in
texture
and
are
practically
confections
kisses
do
not
contain
any
flour
but
macaroons
need
a
small
amount
of
this
ingredient
and
some
varieties
of
them
contain
the
yolks
as
well
as
the
whites
of
eggs
chopped
or
ground
nuts
coconut
and
various
kinds
of
dried
or
candied
fruits
are
added
to
these
cakes
to
give
them
variety
the
mixtures
of
which
these
cakes
are
made
are
either
dropped
by
spoonfuls
or
forced
through
a
pastry
bag
into
little
mounds
or
rosettes
on
an
inverted
pan
or
a
cooky
sheet
and
then
baked
in
a
very
slow
oven
an
oven
of
this
kind
is
necessary
for
the
mixtures
must
be
practically
dried
out
in
the
baking
although
made
of
a
mixture
similar
to
that
used
for
kisses
are
usually
made
in
rather
large
round
flat
shapes
whereas
kisses
are
smaller
and
are
for
the
most
part
made
in
the
shape
of
rosettes
fig

of
kisses
ready
to
serve
while
not
exactly
the
same
as
either
kisses
or
macaroons
are
given
in
this
connection
because
the
mixture
used
for
them
is
similar
to
that
for
kisses
these
as
shown
in
fig
are
in
reality
saltines
covered
with
a
mixture
of
egg
and
sugar
to
which
nuts
coconut
flavoring
etc
may
be

after
the

covering
has
been
applied
the
saltines
are
set
in

and

until
slightly

on

this
variety
of
small

as

as

is
excellent
for

in

respects

they

and
contain
eggs
for
this
reason
they
are
not

and
should

doughnuts
and
crullers
nature
of
doughnuts
and
some
kinds
of
doughnuts
and
crullers
are
made
of
bread
dough
and
for
this
reason
really
belong
to
breakfast
breads
instead
of
to
cakes
however
most
of
the
recipes
for
these
two
foods
include
sugar
shortening
milk
eggs
and
leavening
making
doughnuts
and
crullers
so
similar
to
cake
in
their
composition
that
they
are
usually
regarded
as
cake
mixtures
the
shortening
which
is
in
smaller
amounts
than
is
required
for
most
cakes
is
supplied
largely
by
the
method
of
preparation
peculiar
to
these
cakes
that
is
by
their
being
fried
in
deep
fat
consequently
some
of
the
same
conditions
apply
in
their
preparation
as
in
the
making
of
other
foods
that
are
cooked
in
this
way
as
has
already
been
learned
such
foods
must
either
contain
a
sufficient
amount
of
protein
material
such
as
egg
for
instance
or
be
coated
with
enough
material
of
this
kind
to
prevent
the
absorption
of
fat
in
the
case
of
doughnuts
this
material
is
supplied
as
an
ingredient
shaping
doughnuts
and
the
ingredients
used
in
the
making
of
doughnuts
are
combined
in
much
the
same
way
as
those
used
in
other
cake
mixtures
a
point
to
remember
is
that
the
mixture
like
that
for
cookies
must
be
stiff
enough
to
handle
and
roll
out
but
care
should
be
taken
not
to
use
too
much
flour
for
then
the
doughnuts
are
likely
to
be
tough

of
a
convenient
size
place
one
of
these
on

thimble
or
some
other
small
round
cutter
applied
to
remove
the
center
of
the
pieces
thus
cut
as
here
shown
a
plate
or
some
other
small
dish
containing
flour
should
be
kept
handy
and
the
cutter
dipped
into
this
occasionally
during
the
cutting
to
prevent
it
from
sticking
to
the
dough
and
marring
the
appearance
of
the
doughnuts
collect
the
centers
and
scraps
that
remain
after
the
doughnuts
have
been
cut
from
a
piece

set
these
aside

all
the
fresh
dough
has
been
used

may

be
rolled
out
again

into
doughnuts
if
desired
however
the
centers
may
be
fried

usually
round

hole
in

may
for
variety
be
made
in
other
shapes

instance
after

sometimes
cut

pieces

the
strips
are
braided
and
then
pinched

puddings
and
pudding
sauces
nature
of
puddings
many
kinds
of
puddings
are
used
for
desserts
some
of
them
closely
resemble
cake
mixtures
while
others
are
similar
to
custards
but
are
thickened
with
a
cooked
or
a
raw
starchy
material
formerly
puddings
were
always
boiled
in
a
bag
but
now
desserts
of
this
kind
are
prepared
by
boiling
steaming
or
baking
to
improve
the
flavor
of
puddings
sauces
of
a
contrasting
flavor
are
usually
served
with
them
puddings
are
often
considered
to
be
rather
indigestible
foods
and
in
many
cases
this
is
true
for
this
reason
it
is
not
wise
to
include
them
to
any
great
extent
in
the
diet
of
children
because
of
the
ingredients
used
in
them
they
are
a
heavy
food
and
are
usually
high
in
food
value
consequently
some
thought
should
be
given
to
their
selection
so
that
they
may
be
suitable
for
the
rest
of
the
meal
in
which
they
are
served
it
seems
to
be
the
custom
to
serve
a
rich
dessert
with
a
heavy
meal
but
as
is
well
known
it
is
less
proper
with
such
a
meal
than
with
a
light
meal
a
little
attention
given
to
this
matter
will
enable
the
housewife
to
prepare
menus
that
will
provide
the
family
with
a
properly
balanced
meal
the
time
of
day
and
the
season
of
the
year
for
the
serving
of
puddings
are
also
matters
that
should
receive
consideration
it
is
much
better
to
serve
desserts
of
this
kind
with
a
noon
meal
than
with
an
evening
meal
then
too
warm
puddings
with
sauce
will
be
found
much
more
appetizing
in
the
cool
season
of
the
year
than
in
warm
weather
on
the
other
hand
cool
desserts
or
fruits
served
as
desserts
are
very
much
more
acceptable
in
warm
weather
than
during
the
cold
seasons
pudding
sauces
the
sauces
served
with
puddings
deserve
just
as
much
attention
as
to
selection
and
preparation
as
the
puddings
themselves
for
instance
a
sour
sauce
that
is
not
rich
such
as
lemon
sauce
should
be
served
with
a
rich
sweet
pudding
while
a
rich
hard
sauce
or
perhaps
a
chocolate
sauce
is
the
proper
kind
to
serve
with
a
bland
flavorless
pudding
so
that
the
housewife
may
be
perfectly
familiar
with
a
variety
of
sauces
and
thus
know
the
nature
of
the
sauces
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
puddings
themselves
a
number
of
recipes
for
pudding
sauces
are
given
some
of
these
are
intended
to
be
served
hot
and
others
cold
while
a
few
may
be
served
either
hot
or
cold
as
preferred
selection
may
be
made
from
these
for
any
pudding
that
is
accompanied
by
a
sauce
when
served
care

puddings
preparation
of
puddings
as
has
already
been
learned
puddings
are
cooked
by
being
boiled
steamed
or
baked
no
different
utensils
from
those
used
in
the
making
of
custards
and
cakes
need
be
provided
for
the
making
of
puddings
except
perhaps
a
steamer
a
utensil
of
this
kind
which
is
required
for
steamed
puddings
consists
of
a
large
pan
which
sets
directly
over
the
flame
and
into
which
the
water
is
poured
a
second
pan
which
fits
closely
into
the
first
one
and
into
which
the
pudding
is
put
and
a
spout
into
which
the
water
may
be
poured
the
steamer
must
be
very
closely
covered
in
order
that
all
the
steam
which
does
the
cooking
may
be
retained
an
apparatus
that
will
answer
the
purpose
of
a
steamer
may
be
improvised
however
if
there
are
in
the
supply
of
household
utensils
a
pan
a
colander
and
a
cover
that
will
fit
tight
enough
to
retain
the
steam
or
instead
of
putting
the
pudding
directly
in
the
second
pan
of
the
steamer
it
may
be
put
into
individual
molds
or
a
pan
that
will
hold
a
sufficient
quantity
to
serve
just
the
desired
number
of
persons
and
these
then
set
in
the
second
pan
to
cook

be

whichever
one
of
these
two
methods
of
preparing
steamed
puddings
is
preferred
may
be
adopted
when
puddings
are
cooked
by
steaming
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
steaming
process
must
be
continuous
therefore
if
water
must
be
added
during
the
cooking
boiling
water
should
be
used
so
as
not
to
lower
the
temperature
and
stop
the
formation
of
steam
after
being
steamed
sufficiently
puddings
of
this
kind
are
often
placed
in
the
oven
for
a
short
time
in
order
to
dry
the
surface

the
baking
of
puddings
is
so
similar
to
the
baking
of
cakes
and
custards
that
the
same
directions
apply
a
few
points
however
should
be
kept
well
in
mind
if
good
puddings
would
be
the
result
the
utensil
in
which
a
pudding
that
is
to
be
baked
is
put
may
be
of
any
desired
shape
but
it
should
always
be
greased
this
also
holds
true
in
the
case
of
puddings
that
are
to
be
steamed
puddings
that
contain
an
mixture
as
for
instance
bread
pudding
must
necessarily
as
with
custards
be
baked
at
a
temperature
low

of

and

pastry
is
a
shortened
dough
that
is
made
of
flour
water
salt
and
fat
and
used
in
the
preparation
of
desserts
chief
among
these
deserts
are
pies
these
are
made
by
baking
foods
between
two
crusts
of
pastry
or
with
a
single
crust
which
may
be
an
upper
or
a
lower
one
originally
pies
were
not
intended
for
desserts
rather
they
were
used
as
the
main
dish
of
the
meal
as
they
contained
a
filling
of
meat
or
fish
and
vegetables
such
pies
are
still
made
but
they
are
not
usually
the
ones
intended
when
pastry
for
pies
is
mentioned
it
should
therefore
be
understood
that
the
pastry
considered
in
this
section
is
that
which
is
used
with
sweet
fillings
and
employed
particularly
in
the
making
of
pies
and
similar
foods
that
are
used
for
desserts
some
cooks
especially
the
french
ones
regard
as
pastry
such
foods
as
certain
small
cakes
the
paste
used
for
cream
puffs
and
éclairs
and
the
sweetened
breads
made
with
yeast
such
as
brioche
in
reality
such
desserts
resemble
cakes
in
use
more
than
they
do
pastry
and
for
this
reason
are
discussed
in
connection
with
them
pastry
desserts
may
be
made
in
various
fancy
shapes
for
individual
servings
or
in
pies
that
will
serve
five
or
six
persons
pies
having
one
crust
usually
contain
a
filling
that
consists
of
a
custard
mixture
a
mixture
thickened
with
corn
starch
or
flour
or
occasionally
a
fruit
mixture
some
pies
also
have
a
top
crust
covering
the
filling
and
when
this
is
the
case
a
fruit
filling
either
fresh
or
cooked
is
the
kind
that
is
generally
used
because
of
the
nature
of
the
materials
used
in
the
preparation
of
pastry
desserts
the
finished
product
is
necessarily
high
in
food
value
for
instance
starchy
material
is
provided
by
the
flour
fat
by
the
shortening
and
sugar
in
comparatively
large
amounts
by
the
filling
whether
it
be
fruit
of
some
kind
or
a
material
resembling
custard
this
fact
rather
than
the
taste
or
the
appetite
should
aid
in
determining
whether
or
not
pastry
desserts
should
be
included
in
a
meal
while
the
popularity
of
such
desserts
causes
them
to
be
used
somewhat
indiscriminately
their
use
should
always
be
governed
by
the
nature
of
the
rest
of
the
meal
thus
if
the
other
dishes
served
provide
enough
food
value
then
a
dessert
lighter
than
pie
should
be
chosen
but
if
the
rest
of
the
meal
is
not
sufficiently
high
in
this
respect
a
wholesome
pastry
dessert
will
generally
prove
to
be
a
wise
selection
it
is
true
of
course
that
every
person
must
determine
for
himself
whether
or
not
pastry
desserts
are
wholesome
enough
to
be
eaten
by
him
indigestion
is
almost
sure
to
result
from
heavy
soggy
imperfectly
baked
pastry
because
the
quantities
of
fat
it
contains
may
be
slow
to
digest
and
much
of
the
starchy
material
may
be
imperfectly
cooked
consequently
it
is
often
not
the
pie
itself
but
the
way
in
which
it
is
made
that
is
responsible
for
the
bad
reputation
that
this
very
attractive
dessert
has
acquired
if
the
correct
method
of
making
pastry
and
pies
is
followed
and
the
ingredients
are
handled
properly
in
the
making
the
digestibility
of
the
finished
product
need
give
the
housewife
very
little
concern
as
a
rule
a
little
experience
is
needed
in
order
that
good
results
in
the
making
of
pastry
dishes
may
be
attained
but
one
who
becomes
efficient
in
the
other
phases
of
cookery
should
have
no
difficulty
with
foods
of
this
kind
detailed
instructions
regarding
the
making
of
pastry
desserts
are
given
throughout
this
section
but
if
the
greatest
degree
of
success
is
to
be
attained
it
will
be
well
from
the
very
beginning
to
understand
a
few
general
rules
that
apply
to
this
work
in
the
first
place
the
ingredients
must
be
of
the
right
sort
and
as
cold
as
possible
then
they
must
be
handled
and
combined
with
dexterity
and
finally
a
hot
oven
must
be
provided
in
order
that
these
foods
may
be
properly
baked
ingredients
used
for
pastry
the
ingredients
used
in
pastry
making
are
neither
numerous
nor
complicated
usually
including
only
flour
salt
shortening
and
liquid
if
these
are
correctly
combined
they
will
be
all
that
is
required
to
make
a
pastry
that
is
light
flaky
and
crisp
occasionally
a
recipe
requiring
baking
powder
will
be
found
and
sometimes
eggs
are
called
for
in
mixtures
of
this
kind
but
neither
of
these
ingredients
is
required
for
successful
pastry
making
baking
powder
may
be
an
advantage
when
it
is
used
by
one
who
is
not
experienced
in
the
handling
of
pastry
mixtures
for
it
helps
to
make
pastry
lighter
however
only
a
small
quantity
of
this
ingredient
should
be
used
as
a
very
little
will
bring
about
the
desired
result
flour
for
pastry
flour
is
the
most
desirable
for
pastry
making
it
is
made
from
winter
wheat
which
as
has
already
been
explained
contains
less
gluten
and
therefore
lacks
the
gummy
consistency
of
bread
flour
for
puff
paste
which
is
prepared
so
as
to
hold
air
between
thin
layers
of
pastry
bread
flour
is
often
used
because
it
retains
air
better
flours
made
of
other
cereals
may
also
be
used
pastry
made
of
such
flours
is
more
difficult
to
handle
but
good
results
may
be
obtained
if
patience
and
care
are
exercised
when
corn
flour
rice
flour
and
barley
flour
are
used
as
part
of
the
flour
for
pastry
it
will
be
found
that
less
shortening
is
needed
than
when
wheat
flour
alone
is
used
the
dark
flours
such
as
barley
produce
a
pastry
that
is
dark
in
color
but
this
is
no
particular
disadvantage
so
long
as
the
quality
is
not
impaired
no
matter
what
kind
of
flour
is
used
for
the
pastry
it
should
be
as
dry
as
possible
at

putting
the
flour
in
a
warm
oven
and
allowing
it

dry
will
prove
to
be
advantageous
however
flour
so
treated

be
cooled

but
in
most
cases
the

not
so
successful
if
pastry
is
to
have
the
desired
flakiness
the
shortening
must
not
be
broken
into
such
minute
particles
and
the
flour
must
not
be
saturated
with
fat
as
is
more
likely
to
be
the
case
if
oil
is
used
in

of

in

to
being
solid
the
fat
should
be
just
as
cold

the
fat
that
is

for
other
varieties

utilized
lard
has
always
been
a
particular
favorite
for
pastry
making
still
for
ordinary
pastry
making
there
are
various
combinations
of
fat
of
both
animal
and
vegetable
origin
which
serve
the

certain
fats
left
over
from

cooking
processes

chicken
fat
is
a
very
satisfactory
one

mixture
of
lard
and
beef
suet
also
makes
an
ideal
fat
for

the
hard
flakiness
of
the
suet
being
particularly
desirable
in
fact
almost
any
fat
without
a
disagreeable
odor
or
flavor
may
be
used
as
all
or
part
of
the
fat
required
as
has
already
been
learned
fats
may
be
clarified
and
freed
of
their
odor

first
heating
them

comparatively
small
amount
of

while
others
require
a
large

the
use
to
which
the

an
amount
midway
between
the
two
extremes
is
usually
sufficient
while
oftentimes
less

be
used
to
advantage
it
should
be
remembered
that
fat
is
the
most
expensive
ingredient
in
pastry
making
and
should
be
used
with
discretion
the

explained
in

an
example
of
a

be
well
to
observe
the
placing

description
may

very
satisfactory

have
a
round
bottom
as
the

may
be
kept
together
better
in
such
a

rolling
out
the

to
use
for

depends
largely
on
the
opinion

answer

satisfactory
the
enamel
top

methods
of
mixing
pastry
several
methods
of
mixing
the
ingredients
used
in
pastry
are
followed
each
one
producing
a
different
effect
in
the
finished
product
the
method
employed
in
the
making
of
plain
pastry
such
as
is
commonly
used
for
pies
consists
in
first
mixing
the
shortening
and
the
flour
and
then
adding
the
liquid
another
method
is
adopted
for
pastries
that
are
intended
to
be
somewhat
flakier
and
of
a
little
better
quality
than
plain
pastry
in
this
method
half
of
the
fat
is
mixed
with
the
flour
and
the
water
is
then
added
to
the
mixture
with
this
done
the
dough
that
is
formed
is
rolled
out
the
remaining
fat
placed
on
it
and
the
pastry
then
folded
and
rolled
repeatedly
in
such
a
way
as
to
incorporate
all
the
fat
still
another
method
is
followed
when
puff
paste
or
fancy
pastry
dishes
are
desired
only
a
very
small
quantity
of
fat
is
mixed
with
the
flour
or
flour
alone
is
prepared
water
is
then
added
and
the
mixture
is
kneaded
until
it
becomes
smooth
and
elastic
when
the
kneading
is
done
the
dough
is
rolled
out
in
a
certain
shape
the
fat
is
placed
on
it
and
after
it
is
folded
over
the
fat
it
is
put
through
a
series
of
foldings
and
rollings
until
all
the
fat
is
incorporated
the
first
and
the
third
of
these
methods
are
explained
and
illustrated
here
in
detail
so
that
the
housewife
ought
not
have
any
difficulty
in
producing
splendid
results
as
the
second
method
is
practically
a
combination
of
the
other
two
familiarity
with
them
will
insure
success
with
it
pastry
ingredients
may
be
mixed
by
methods
that
differ
from
the
three
just
mentioned
one
of
these
is
illustrated
in
the
method
given
later
for
the
making
of
easy
pastry
this
seems
to
be
a
complete
reversal
of
the
rules
observed
in
making
pastry
in
the
usual
ways
the
water
is
hot
and
the
fat
is
melted
in
it
the
flour
is
added
to
the
liquid
and
the
fat
instead
of
the
liquid
being
added
to
the
flour
and
the
fat
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
this
appears
to
be
contrary
the
results
obtained
by
this
method
are
satisfactory
pastry

and
baking
procedure
in
making
plain
the
first
step
in
the
making
of
plain
pastry
consists
in
sifting
the
flour
with
the
salt
into
the
mixing
bowl
after
this
has
been
done
the
fat
should
be
worked
into
the
flour
an
operation
that
may
be
accomplished
in
three
ways
the
method
most
commonly
adopted
is
to
work
in
the
fat
with
the
fingers
but
this
plan
has
its
disadvantages
in
that
it
is
not
a
very
agreeable
way
and
the
fat
becomes
so
warmed
by
the
higher
temperature
of
the
fingers
that
it
is
liable
to
impair
the
finished
product
again
some
persons
mix
the
fat
with
the
flour
by
means
of
a
fork
using
this
utensil
to
crush
the
lumps
of
fat
against
the
sides
of
the
bowl
illustration
fig
by
far
the
most
satisfactory
method
and
the
one
that
produces
the
best
results
is
that
shown
in
fig
put
the
required
amount
of
fat
into
the
bowl
containing
the
flour
and
the
salt
and
then
with
two
knives
as
shown
cut
the
fat
into
the
flour
until
the
particles
of
fat
are
about
the
size
of
a
small
pea
as
can
readily
be
seen
this
method
which
is
perhaps
as
speedy
as
any
method
that
may
be
adopted
has
the
advantage
of
being
entirely
sanitary
the
next
step
is
that
of
adding
the
liquid
to
the
mixture
of
flour
and
fat
heap
the
particles
up
in
the
center
of

often
especially
in
the

juice
that

inside

cooks
out
this
is
a
condition
that
must
be
overcome
if
satisfactory
pies
are
to
be
the
result
various
means
of
preventing
it
have
been
suggested
but
one
of
the
successful
ones
consists
in
rolling
a
small
piece
of
paper
into
a
funnel
shape
leaving
both
ends
open
and
inserting
the
small
end
in
one
of
the
openings
in
the
top
crust
this
arrangement
provides
a
vent
for
the
steam
and
so
the
juice
is
less
likely
to
cook
out
of
the
crust
while
the
pie
is
baking
utilizing
pastry
in
making
pies
it
is
well
to
mix
only
the
quantity
of
paste
that
is
desired
for
the
number
of
pies
to
be
made
usually
cupfuls
of
flour
will
make
sufficient
paste
for
one
pie
provided
the
pan
in
which
it
is
made
is
not
too
large
in
case
it
is
necessary
to
make
fresh
pie
on
two
consecutive
days
a
good
plan
is
to
make
at
one
time
enough
paste
for
both
days
for
what
remains
after
the
first
pie
is
made
may
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
refrigerator
or
some
other
cool
place
then
it
may
be
rolled
out
on
the
second
day
and
used
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
on
the
first
however
it
is
a
rather
difficult
matter
to
make
the
exact
amount
of
paste
for
the
pies
needed
if
nothing
more
remains
there
are
usually
small
scraps
left
over
from
the
trimming
of
the
edge
these
should
by
all
means
be
put
to
some
good
use
for
the
material
is
equally
as
good
as
that
which
has
been
used
in
the
pie
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
be
wasted
very
good
way
in
which
to
utilize
these
scraps
is
to
make
tarts
of
various
kinds
and
shapes
out

should

not
be
obtained
lemon
juice
sprinkled
over
the

after

the
most
popular
ones

the
apples
are
very
juicy
a
little
flour
mixed
with
the
sugar

sprinkled

will
help

usually
this
is
not
necessary
a

flour
or
other
starchy
material
must
necessarily
be
used

out
when
the

is
served
if
the

a

larger
quantity

this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
acid
of
the

reduces
the
starch
in
the

to
dextrine
and
this
form

does

rhubarb

very
much
appreciated
the
most
popular

in
which
it
is
served
is
probably
in

it
requires
considerable
sugar
in

to
make

mince
mince
meat
which
is
much
used
for
pies
during
the
fall
and
winter
season
is
a
concoction
that
finds
favor
with
most
people
it
may
be
comparatively
simple
or
it
may
contain
a
large
variety
of
ingredients
and
in
accordance
with
this
variation
it
may
be
cheap
or
expensive
however
the
ingredients
generally
used
in
this
mixture
are
apples
dried
fruits
sugar
molasses
cider
and
chopped
beef
and
suet
other
fruits
such
as
quinces
oranges
and
citron
and
various
spices
are
also
often
used
for
flavoring
the
cheaper
cuts
of
meat
such
as
the
neck
shoulder
brisket
are
suitable
for
this
purpose
because
the
meat
is
ground
so
fine
in
making
the
mince
meat
that
the
fact
that
it
was
at
all
tough
can
be
very
readily
concealed
such
expensive
material
as
citron
can
be
omitted
altogether
if
desired
and
greater
quantities
of
apples
which
are
the
cheapest
ingredient
used
a
slight
variation
in
the
ingredients
does
not
make
any
material
difference
in
this
mixture

the
recipes
given

submitted
merely
as
a
basis
from
which
to
work
if
used
just
as
they
are

they
will
be
found
to
be
excellent
but
if
it
is
necessary
to
practice
greater
economy
or
if
it
is
not
possible
to
secure
all
the
ingredients
called
for

may
be
varied
to
suit
conditions
the

from

the

be
used
in

pies
many
varieties
of
pies
are
made
with

crust
and
these
usually
prove
more
attractive
than
those
having
two
crusts
as
a
rule
the
filling
is
a
custard
or
a
mixture
but
often
fruits
of
various
kinds
as
well
as
pumpkin
and
squash
are
used
in
the
making
of
pies
of
this
kind
frequently
meringue
is
used
as
a
covering
for
pies
or
if
an
especially
delicious
dessert
is
desired
a
thick
layer
of
stiffly
beaten
and
sweetened
whipped
cream
is
often
added
to
the
pie
just
before
serving
again
a
partly
open
pie
is
sometimes
made
this
being
done
by
putting
strips
or
pieces
of
paste
over
the
filling
before
the
pie
is
baked
individual
pies
of
this
kind
are
attractive
for
special
occasions
and
may
be
made
to
advantage
if
small
pie
pans
are

the

for

is
often
placed
over
the

of

the

filling
and
returned
to
the

whether
the
lower
crust
should
not
be
baked
or
should
be
partly
or
entirely
baked
before
the

put

depends
on
the
character
of
the

and
the
degree
of

required
to
cook
it
meringue
for
since
meringue
is
often
used
as
a
garnish
for
pies
the
housewife
should
understand
its
nature
and
the
proper
procedure
in
its
making
when
it
is
correctly
made
and
properly
baked
it
is
very
attractive
and
improves
the
appearance
of
the
dessert
but
failure
in
these
respects
is
likely
to
result
in
a
tough
shrunken
meringue
which
had
better
be
omitted
as
it
detracts
from
the
appearance
of
the
pie
and
is
not
agreeable
to
the
taste
if
an
attractive
appetizing
meringue
is
to
be
the
result
the
eggs
that
are
used
must
be
in
good
condition
and
very
cold
also
they
must
be
properly
beaten
so
that
there
will
be
no
loss
of
air
in
manipulating
the
whites
when
they
are
placed
on
top
of
the
pie
mixture
the
baking
is
important
too
both
the
length
of
time
the
meringue
remains
in
the
oven
and
the
temperature
to
which
it
is
subjected
having
a
direct
bearing
on
the
finished
meringue
to
make
meringue
first
separate
the
whites
from
the
yolks
and
chill
them
thoroughly
beat
them
with
a
fork
or
an
egg
whip
until
they
are
almost
stiff
that
is
until
they
will
hold
their
shape
fairly
well
but
will
drop
from
the
fork
or
whip
when
it
is
raised
at
this
point
begin
to
add
the
sugar
which
if
possible
should
be
either
confectioner
or
pulverized
although
granulated
sugar
may
be
used
if
the
others
can
not
be
obtained
add
the
sugar
slowly
and
continue
the
beating
until
all
of
it
has
been
incorporated
the
meringue
is
then
ready
to
place
on
the
filling
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
filling
must
be
partly
or
entirely
cooked
before
the
meringue
is
applied
so
that
when
the
pie
is
returned
to
the
oven
nothing
but
the
meringue
will
require
cooking
illustration
fig
the
manner
in
which
meringue
is
placed
on
pie
has
much
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
the
pie
if
it
is
spread
on
the
filling
in
an
even
layer
the
pie
will
invariably
look
stiff
and
unattractive
by
far
the
better
way
is
to
drop
it
by
spoonfuls
roughly
over
the
top
of
the
filling
or
first
to
spread
a
thin
layer
over
the
top
in
order
to
cover
the
entire
surface
and
then
to
drop
the
remainder
of
the
meringue
over
this
by
spoonfuls
or
it
may
be
forced
through
a
pastry
tube
into
rosettes
or
frills
of
any
preferred
design
the
advantage
of
applying
it
unevenly
rather
than
in
a
thin
layer
is
that
the
rough
surface
will
brown
where
the
spots
are
high
and
the
depressions
will
be
a
lighter
brown
or
white
when
the
pie
has
been
covered
with
meringue
set
it
in
a
moderate
oven
and
let
it
bake
for
to
minutes
or
until
it
is
properly
browned
when
it
will
appear
as
in
fig
by
no
means
allow
the
meringue
to
remain
in
the
oven
longer
than
this
for
as
soon
as
the

is
completed
it

puff
paste
procedure
in
making
puff
the
making
of
puff
paste
differs
somewhat
from
the
making
of
plain
pastry
if
puff
paste
is
to
be
successful
it
must
be
made
carefully
and
with
close
attention
to
every
detail
even
then
the
first
attempt
may
not
prove
to
be
entirely
successful
for
often
considerable
experience
is
required
before
one
becomes
expert
in
the
making
of
this
delicate
pastry
illustration
fig
the
best
time
to
make
puff
paste
is
in
the
cold
weather
as
the
butter
which
is
the
fat
used
can
be
handled
more
easily
and
rolled
into
the
paste
with
greater
success
if
it
as
well
as
the
other
ingredients
are
cold
if
puff
paste
is
desired
in
weather
that
is
not
cold
the
mixture
will
have
to
be
placed
on
ice
at
various
intervals
for
it
positively
must
be
kept
as
cold
as
possible
however
it
is
always
preferable
to
make
puff
paste
without
the
assistance
of
ice
further
essentials
in
the
making
of
successful
puff
paste
are
a
light
touch
and
as
little
handling
as
possible
heavy
pressure
with
the
rolling
pin
and
rolling
in
the
wrong
direction
are
mistakes
that
result
in
an
inferior
product
the
desirable
light
tender
qualities
of

paste
can
be
obtained
only
by
giving
attention
to
these
details
before
beginning
the
mixing

tablespoonfuls
which
must

retained
for
flouring
the

when

it
to

down
over

roll
in
one
direction
and
not
to
allow
the
butter
to
come
through
the
paste

have
to
be
treated
until

becomes
perfectly
cold

again
continue
in
this
manner
until
the

has
been
rolled
about
six
times
and
during

process
try
if
possible
to
keep

set
the

on
the
floor
of
the

in

to
give
the

every

if
it

unevenly
turn
it
around

that
it
will

should
there

put

recipe
for
puff
either
bread
or
pastry
flour
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
puff
paste
but
if
pastry
flour
is
used
a
tablespoonful
or
two
more
will
be
required
illustration
fig
the
amount
of
cold
water
needed
varies
with
the
absorbing
power
of
the
flour
however
only
enough
should
be
used
to
make
it
possible
to
knead
the
mass
of
dough
that
forms
so
that
it
may
become
elastic
kneading
develops
the
gluten
in
the
flour
and
helps
to
hold
in
the
fat
thus
making
the
paste
easier
to
handle
puff
paste
flour
butter
cold
water
put
the
flour
into
a
mixing
bowl
and
chop
a
tablespoonful
of
the
butter
into
it
add
cold
water
until
a
mass
that
may
be
removed
to
a
baking
board
is
formed
then
proceed
in
the
manner
explained
for
the
making
of
puff
paste
uses
of
puff
puff
paste
is
seldom
used
in
the
making
of
or
pies
instead
it
is
usually
employed
for
daintier
desserts
commonly
known
as
however
there
are
really
innumerable
uses
to
which
it
may
be
put
in
addition
to
those
for
which
ordinary
pastry
can
be
used
in
fact
after
the
art
of
making
this
kind
of
pastry
is
mastered
it
will
prove
to
be
invaluable
for
serving
on
special
occasions
with
puff
paste
may
be
made
tarts
of
any
kind
or
shape
particularly
attractive
tarts
can
be
made
by
covering
small
tins
in
the
manner
shown
in
fig
and
then
after
the
shapes
have
been
baked
filling
each
one
with
half
of
a
peach
or
half
of
an
apricot
and
juice
that
has
boiled
thick
and
piling
sweetened
whipped
cream
over
it
puff
paste
made
into
the
same
shapes
as
those
just
mentioned
for
tarts
may
have
placed
in
it
a
layer
of
cake
on
top
of
which
may
be
spread
a
layer
of
jam
and
to
add
a
dainty
touch
either
whipped
cream
or
chopped
nuts
may
be
put
over
the
jam
the
cake
used
for
such
a
dessert
should
preferably
be
simple
butter
cake
or
sponge
cake
such
as
might
be
baked
in
a
loaf
puff
paste
in
the
form
of
tubes
and
shells
may
be
used
for
serving
foods
daintily
thus
a
hollow
tube
may
be
made
by
rolling
the
paste
very
thin
cutting
it
into
rectangular
pieces
placing
each
piece
over
a
round
stick
about
inches
in
diameter
and
then
baking
after
the
baked
tube
is
slipped
off
the
stick
it
may
be
filled
with
sweetened
and
flavored
whipped
cream
to
which
may
be
added
chopped
nuts
chopped
fruit
or
jam
small
baked
shells
of
puff
paste
answer
very
well
as
timbale
cases
which
may
be
filled
with
creamed
mushrooms
creamed
sweetbreads
or
other
delicate
creamed
food
if
shells
are
not
desired
small
triangular
or
round
pieces
may
be
cut
and
baked
and
creamed
food
served
over
them
as
it
would
be
served
over
toast
an
attractive
dessert
may
be
prepared
by
baking
several
rectangular
pieces
of
puff
paste
in
the
oven
and
then
arranging
them
in
two
or
three
layers
with
custard
between
simple
sugar
icings
into
which
some
butter
is
beaten
may
also
be
utilized
to
advantage
in
making
french
pastry
of
this
kind
puff
paste
may
also
be
used
as
the
covering
for
small
individual
pies
serving
pastry
to
be
most
palatable
pastry
should
be
served
as
soon
as
possible
after
it
is
baked
when
it
is
allowed
to
stand
for
any
length
of
time
the
lower
crust
becomes
soaked
with
moisture
from
the
filling
used
and
in
this
state
the
pie
is
not
only
unpalatable
but
to
a
certain
extent
indigestible
consequently
whenever
it
is
possible
only
enough
for
one
meal
should
be
baked
at
a
time
after
a
pie
is
taken
from
the
oven
it
should
not
be
removed
from
the
pan
in
which
it
is
baked
until
it
is
served
in
fact
pie
with
a
tender
crust
can
not
be
handled
easily
and
so
should
be
cut
while
it
is
still
in
the
pan
often
it
is
best
to
serve
a
pie
warm
when
this
is
to
be
done
it
can
be
served
immediately
upon
being
taken
from
the
oven
or
if
it
has
been
baked
for
some
time
and
is
cold
it
may
be
set
in
the
oven
and
reheated
before
serving
such
treatment
will
freshen
any
pie
that
has
become
more
or
less
stale
and
as
is
well
known
pie
is
much
more
palatable
when
it
is
warm
and
fresh
than
when
it
is
cold
or
stale
in
case
pies
must
be
kept
before
being
served
they
should
be
stored
in
a
place
that
is
both
cold
and
dry
a
refrigerator
is
too
damp
and
for
this
reason
should
not
be
used
but
any
other
cool
place
that
is
sufficiently
dry
will
be
satisfactory
several
ways
of
serving
pie
are
in
practice
this
dessert
may
be
baked
in
attractive
dishes
especially
designed
for
this
purpose
and
then
served
from
them
at
the
table
or
it
may
be
baked
in
an
ordinary
pie
pan
and
then
placed
on
a
plate
larger
than
the
pan
for
serving
pie
of
the
usual
size
is
generally
divided
into
five
or
six
pieces
a
sharp
knife
being
used
to
cut
it
if
possible
a
pie
knife
which
is
narrow
at
the
end
of
the
blade
and
gradually
grows
broader
until
the
handle
is
reached
where
it
is
very
broad
should
be
provided
for
the
serving
of
this
dessert
for
it
helps
very
much
in
handling
the
triangular
pieces
that
are
cut
from
a
large
pie
the
plates
on
which
pie
is
served
should
be
at
least
as
large
as
salad
plates
very
often
instead
of
serving
it
from
the
pan
at
the
table
it
is
put
on
plates
in
the
kitchen
and
passed
at
the
table
pie
is
always
eaten
with
a
fork
one
that
is
smaller
than
a
dinner
fork
being
used
with
most
pies
containing
fruit
filling
a
small
piece
of
cheese
preferably
highly
flavored
cheese
may
be
served
this
makes
a
very
good
accompaniment
so
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
but
is
omitted
in
some
meals
because
it
may
supply
too
much
food
value
or
too
much
protein
however
if
the
fact
that
a
food
is
to
be
served
at
the
end
of
the
meal
is
taken
into
account
when
the
remainder
of
the
meal
is
planned
there
need
be
no
hesitancy
in
serving
cheese
with
pie
of
course
when
cheese
is
to
be
included
in
the
meal
in
this
way
the
portions
of
the
protein
foods
served
with
the
main
course
should
be
smaller
a
very
attractive
as
well
as
appetizing
way
in
which
to
serve
pie
is
known
as
à
la
this
method
of
serving
which
is
often
resorted
to
when
something
extra
is
desired
consists
in
placing
a
spoonful
or
two
of
ice
cream
of
any
flavor
on
each
serving
of
apple
or
other
fruit
pie
pie
served
in
this
way
is
high
in

is
