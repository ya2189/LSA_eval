inaugural
lecture
delivered
october
by
bateson
professor
of
biology
in
the
university
of
cambridge
cambridge
at
the
university
press
edition
prefatory
note
the
professorship
of
biology
was
founded
in
for
a
period
of
five
years
partly
by
the
generosity
of
an
anonymous
benefactor
and
partly
by
the
university
of
cambridge
the
object
of
the
endowment
was
the
promotion
of
inquiries
into
the
physiology
of
heredity
and
variation
a
study
now
spoken
of
as
genetics
it
is
now
recognized
that
the
progress
of
such
inquiries
will
chiefly
be
accomplished
by
the
application
of
experimental
methods
especially
those
which
mendel
discovery
has
suggested
the
purpose
of
this
inaugural
lecture
is
to
describe
the
outlook
over
this
field
of
research
in
a
manner
intelligible
to
students
of
other
parts
of
knowledge
b
october
the
methods
and
scope
of
genetics
the
opportunity
of
addressing
pursuing
lines
of
inquiry
other
than
his
own
falls
seldom
to
a
scientific
man
one
of
these
rare
opportunities
is
offered
by
the
constitution
of
the
professorship
to
which
i
have
had
the
honour
to
be
called
that
professorship
though
bearing
the
comprehensive
title
of
biology
is
founded
with
the
understanding
that
the
holder
shall
apply
himself
to
a
particular
class
of
physiological
problems
the
study
of
which
is
denoted
by
the
term
genetics
the
term
is
new
and
though
the
problems
are
among
the
oldest
which
have
vexed
the
human
mind
the
modes
by
which
they
may
be
successfully
attacked
are
also
of
modern
invention
there
is
therefore
a
certain
fitness
in
the
employment
of
this
occasion
for
the
deliverance
of
a
discourse
explaining
something
of
the
aims
of
genetics
and
of
the
methods
by
which
we
trust
they
may
be
reached
you
will
be
aware
that
the
claims
put
forward
in
the
name
of
genetics
are
high
but
i
trust
to
be
able
to
show
you
that
they
are
not
high
without
reason
it
is
the
ambition
of
every
one
who
in
youth
devotes
himself
to
the
search
for
natural
truth
that
his
work
may
be
found
somewhere
in
the
main
stream
of
progress
so
long
only
as
he
keeps
something
of
the
limitless
hope
with
which
his
voyage
of
discovery
began
will
his
courage
and
his
spirit
last
the
moment
we
most
dread
is
one
in
which
it
may
appear
that
after
all
our
effort
has
been
spent
in
exploring
some
petty
tributary
or
worse
a
backwater
of
the
great
current
it
is
because
genetic
research
is
still
pushing
forward
in
the
central
undifferentiated
trunk
of
biological
science
that
we
confess
no
guilt
of
presumption
in
declaring
boldly
that
whatever
difficulty
may
be
in
store
for
those
who
cast
in
their
lot
with
us
they
need
fear
no
disillusionment
or
misgiving
that
their
labour
has
been
wasted
on
a
paltry
quest
in
research
as
in
all
business
of
exploration
the
stirring
times
come
when
a
fresh
region
is
suddenly
unlocked
by
the
discovery
of
a
new
key
then
conquest
is
easy
and
there
are
prizes
for
all
we
are
happy
in
that
during
our
own
time
not
a
few
such
territories
have
been
revealed
to
the
vision
of
mankind
i
do
not
dare
to
suggest
that
in
magnitude
or
splendour
the
field
of
genetics
may
be
compared
with
that
now
being
disclosed
to
the
physicist
or
the
astronomer
for
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
but
i
will
say
that
for
once
to
the
man
of
ordinary
power
who
can
not
venture
into
those
heights
beyond
mendel
clue
has
shown
the
way
into
a
realm
of
nature
which
for
surprising
novelty
and
adventure
is
hardly
to
be
excelled
it
is
no
hyperbolical
figure
that
i
use
when
i
speak
of
mendelian
discovery
leading
us
into
a
new
world
the
very
existence
of
which
was
unsuspected
before
the
road
thither
is
simple
and
easy
to
follow
we
start
from
a
common
fact
familiar
to
everyone
that
all
the
ordinary
animals
and
plants
began
their
individual
life
by
the
union
of
two
cells
the
one
male
the
other
female
those
cells
are
known
as
or
that
is
to
say
marrying
cells
now
obviously
the
diversity
of
form
which
is
characteristic
of
the
animal
and
plant
world
must
be
somehow
represented
in
the
gametes
since
it
is
they
which
bring
into
each
organism
all
that
it
contains
i
am
aware
that
there
is
interplay
between
the
organism
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
grows
up
and
that
opportunity
given
may
bring
out
a
potentiality
which
without
that
opportunity
must
have
lain
dormant
but
while
noting
parenthetically
that
this
question
of
opportunity
has
an
importance
which
some
day
it
may
be
convenient
to
estimate
the
one
certain
fact
is
that
all
the
powers
physical
and
mental
that
a
living
creature
possesses
were
contributed
by
one
or
by
both
of
the
two
which
united
in
fertilisation
to
give
it
existence
the
fact
that
cells
are
concerned
in
the
production
of
all
the
ordinary
forms
of
life
was
discovered
a
long
while
ago
and
has
been
part
of
the
common
stock
of
elementary
knowledge
of
all
educated
persons
for
about
half
a
century
the
full
consequences
of
this
double
nature
seem
nevertheless
to
have
struck
nobody
before
mendel
simple
though
the
fact
is
i
have
noticed
that
to
many
it
is
difficult
to
assimilate
as
a
working
idea
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
a
man
a
butterfly
or
an
apple
tree
as
each
thing
in
order
to
understand
the
significance
of
mendelism
we
must
get
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
fact
that
they
are
each
things
double
throughout
every
part
of
their
composition
there
is
perhaps
no
better
exercise
as
a
preparation
for
genetic
research
than
to
examine
the
people
one
meets
in
daily
life
and
to
try
in
a
rough
way
to
analyse
them
into
the
two
assemblages
of
characters
which
are
united
in
them
that
we
are
assemblages
or
medleys
of
our
parental
characteristics
is
obvious
we
all
know
that
a
man
may
have
his
father
hair
his
mother
colour
his
father
voice
his
insensibility
to
music
and
so
on
but
that
is
not
enough
such
an
analysis
is
true
inasmuch
as
the
various
characters
transmitted
independently
but
it
misses
the
essential
point
for
in
each
of
these
respects
the
individual
is
double
and
so
to
get
a
true
picture
of
the
composition
of
the
individual
we
have
to
think
how
of
the
two
original
gametes
was
provided
in
the
matter
of
height
hair
colour
mathematical
ability
and
the
other
features
that
go
to
make
the
man
we
know
the
contribution
of
each
gamete
in
each
respect
has
thus
to
be
separately
brought
to
account
if
we
could
make
a
list
of
all
the
ingredients
that
go
to
form
a
man
and
could
set
out
how
he
is
constituted
in
respect
of
each
of
them
it
would
not
suffice
to
give
one
column
of
values
for
these
ingredients
but
we
must
rule
two
columns
one
for
the
ovum
and
one
for
the
spermatozoon
which
united
in
fertilisation
to
form
that
man
and
in
each
column
we
must
represent
how
that
gamete
was
supplied
in
respect
of
each
of
the
ingredients
in
our
list
when
the
problem
of
heredity
is
thus
represented
we
can
hardly
avoid
discovering
by
mere
inspection
one
of
the
chief
conclusions
to
which
genetic
research
has
led
for
it
is
obvious
that
the
contributions
of
the
male
and
female
gametes
may
in
respect
of
any
of
the
ingredients
be
either
the
same
or
different
in
any
case
in
which
the
contribution
made
by
the
two
cells
is
the
same
the
resulting
organism
in
our
example
the
man
is
as
we
call
it
for
that
ingredient
and
in
all
respects
in
which
the
contribution
from
the
two
sides
of
the
parentage
is
dissimilar
the
resulting
organism
is
to
give
an
intelligible
account
of
the
next
step
in
the
analysis
without
having
recourse
to
precise
and
technical
language
is
not
very
easy
we
have
got
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
see
the
individual
made
up
of
a
large
number
of
distinct
ingredients
contributed
from
two
sources
and
in
respect
of
any
of
them
he
may
have
received
two
similar
portions
or
two
dissimilar
portions
we
shall
not
go
far
wrong
if
we
extend
and
elaborate
our
illustration
thus
let
us
imagine
the
contents
of
a
gamete
as
a
fluid
made
by
taking
a
drop
from
each
of
a
definite
number
of
bottles
in
a
chest
containing
tinctures
of
the
several
ingredients
there
is
one
such
chest
from
which
the
male
gamete
is
to
be
made
up
and
a
similar
chest
containing
a
corresponding
set
of
bottles
out
of
which
the
components
of
the
female
gamete
are
to
be
taken
but
in
either
chest
one
or
more
of
the
bottles
may
be
empty
then
nothing
goes
in
to
represent
that
ingredient
from
that
chest
and
if
corresponding
bottles
are
empty
in
both
chests
then
the
individual
made
on
fertilisation
by
mixing
the
two
collections
of
drops
together
does
not
contain
the
missing
ingredient
at
all
it
follows
therefore
that
an
individual
may
thus
be
namely
alike
on
both
sides
of
his
composition
as
regards
each
ingredient
in
one
of
two
ways
either
by
having
received
the
ingredient
from
the
male
chest
and
from
the
female
or
in
having
received
it
from
neither
conversely
in
respect
of
any
ingredient
he
may
be
receiving
the
presence
of
it
from
one
gamete
and
the
absence
of
it
from
the
other
the
second
conception
with
which
we
have
now
to
become
thoroughly
familiar
is
that
of
the
individual
as
composed
of
what
we
call
presences
and
absences
of
all
the
possible
ingredients
it
is
the
basis
of
all
progress
in
genetic
analysis
let
me
give
you
two
illustrations
a
blue
eye
is
due
to
the
absence
of
a
factor
which
forms
pigment
on
the
front
of
the
iris
two
parents
therefore
as
hurst
has
proved
do
not
have
children
the
dark
eye
is
due
to
either
a
single
or
double
dose
of
the
factor
missing
from
the
blue
eye
so
persons
may
have
families
all
or
families
composed
of
a
mixture
of
dark
and
children
in
certain
proportions
which
on
the
average
are
definite
two
plants
of
which
i
exhibit
illustrate
the
same
thing
one
of
them
is
the
ordinary
i
bend
its
stem
it
will
not
break
or
only
breaks
with
difficulty
on
account
of
the
tough
fibres
it
contains
the
stem
of
the
other
one
of
de
vries
famous
mutations
snaps
at
once
like
short
pastry
because
it
does
not
contain
the
factor
for
the
formation
of
the
fibres
such
plants
may
be
produced
by
the
of
one
parent
but
they
are
distinct
in
their
composition
and
properties
and
this
distinction
turns
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
elements
which
are
treated
as
definite
entities
when
the
are
formed
when
we
speak
of
such
qualities
as
the
formation
of
pigment
in
an
eye
or
the
development
of
fibres
in
a
stem
as
due
to
transmitted
elements
or
factors
you
will
perhaps
ask
if
we
have
formed
any
notion
as
to
the
actual
nature
of
those
factors
for
my
own
part
as
regards
that
ulterior
question
i
confess
to
a
disposition
to
hold
my
fancy
on
a
tight
rein
it
can
not
be
very
long
before
we
shall
what
some
of
the
factors
are
and
we
may
leave
guessing
till
then
meanwhile
however
there
is
no
harm
in
admitting
that
several
of
them
behave
much
as
if
they
were
ferments
and
others
as
if
they
constructed
the
substances
on
which
the
ferments
act
but
we
must
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
is
the
ferment
or
the
objective
substance
which
is
transmitted
the
thing
transmitted
can
only
be
the
power
or
faculty
to
produce
the
ferment
or
the
objective
substance
so
far
we
have
been
considering
the
synthesis
of
the
individual
from
ingredients
brought
into
him
by
the
two
gametes
in
the
next
step
of
our
consideration
we
reverse
the
process
and
examine
how
the
ingredients
of
which
he
was
originally
compounded
are
distributed
among
the
gametes
that
are
eventually
budded
off
from
him
take
first
the
case
of
the
components
in
respect
of
which
he
is
expectation
would
naturally
suggest
that
all
the
formed
from
him
would
be
alike
in
respect
of
those
ingredients
and
observation
shows
except
in
the
rare
cases
of
originating
variations
the
causation
of
which
is
still
obscure
that
this
expectation
is
correct
hitherto
though
without
experimental
evidence
no
one
could
have
been
certain
that
the
facts
were
as
i
have
described
them
yet
there
is
nothing
altogether
contrary
to
common
expectation
but
when
we
proceed
to
ask
how
the
will
be
constituted
in
the
case
of
an
individual
who
is
in
some
respect
containing
that
is
to
say
an
ingredient
from
the
one
side
of
his
parentage
and
not
from
the
other
the
answer
is
entirely
contrary
to
all
the
preconceptions
which
either
science
or
common
sense
had
formed
about
heredity
for
we
find
definite
experimental
proof
in
nearly
all
the
cases
which
have
been
examined
that
the
formed
by
such
individuals
do
either
contain
or
not
contain
a
representation
of
the
ingredient
just
as
the
original
gametes
did
or
did
not
contain
it
if
brought
a
certain
quality
in
then
all
the
daughter
gametes
have
it
if
neither
brought
it
in
then
none
of
the
daughter
gametes
have
it
if
it
came
in
from
one
side
and
not
from
the
other
then
on
an
average
in
half
the
resulting
gametes
it
will
be
present
and
from
half
it
will
be
absent
this
last
phenomenon
which
is
called
segregation
constitutes
the
essence
of
mendel
discovery
so
recurring
to
the
simile
of
the
man
as
made
by
the
mixing
of
tinctures
the
process
of
redistribution
of
his
characters
among
the
may
be
represented
as
a
sorting
back
of
the
tinctures
again
into
a
double
row
of
bottles
a
pair
corresponding
to
each
ingredient
and
each
of
the
as
then
made
of
a
drop
from
one
or
other
bottle
of
each
pair
and
in
our
model
we
may
represent
the
phenomenon
of
segregation
in
a
crude
way
by
supposing
that
the
bottles
having
no
tincture
in
them
instead
of
being
empty
contained
an
inoperative
fluid
say
water
with
which
the
tincture
would
not
mix
when
the
new
are
formed
the
two
fluids
instead
of
diluting
each
other
simply
separate
again
it
is
this
fact
which
entitles
us
to
speak
of
the
purity
of
they
are
pure
in
the
possession
of
an
ingredient
or
in
not
possessing
it
and
the
ingredients
or
factors
as
we
generally
call
them
are
units
because
they
are
so
treated
in
the
process
of
formation
of
the
new
gametes
and
because
they
come
out
of
the
process
of
segregation
in
the
same
condition
as
they
went
in
at
fertilisation
as
a
consequence
of
these
facts
it
follows
that
however
complex
may
be
the
origin
of
two
given
parents
the
composition
of
the
offspring
they
can
produce
is
limited
there
is
only
a
limited
number
of
types
to
be
made
by
the
possible
recombinations
of
the
parental
ingredients
and
the
relative
numbers
in
which
each
type
will
be
represented
are
often
predicable
by
very
simple
arithmetical
rules
for
example
if
neither
parent
possesses
a
certain
factor
at
all
then
none
of
the
offspring
will
have
it
if
either
parent
has
two
doses
of
the
factor
then
all
the
children
will
have
it
and
if
either
parent
has
one
dose
of
the
factor
and
the
other
has
none
then
on
an
average
half
the
family
will
have
it
and
half
be
without
it
to
know
whether
the
parent
possesses
the
factor
or
not
may
be
difficult
for
reasons
which
will
presently
appear
but
often
it
is
quite
easy
and
can
be
told
at
once
for
there
are
many
factors
which
can
not
be
present
in
the
individual
without
manifesting
their
presence
i
may
illustrate
the
descent
of
such
a
factor
by
the
case
of
a
family
possessing
a
peculiar
form
of
the
affected
individuals
marrying
with
those
unaffected
have
a
mixture
of
affected
and
unaffected
children
but
their
unaffected
children
not
having
the
responsible
ingredient
can
not
pass
it
on
in
such
an
observation
two
things
are
strikingly
exemplified
the
fact
of
the
permanence
of
the
unit
and
the
fact
that
a
of
types
in
the
family
means
that
one
or
other
parent
is
in
some
respect
and
is
giving
off
gametes
of
more
than
one
type
the
problem
of
heredity
is
thus
a
problem
primarily
analytical
we
have
to
detect
and
enumerate
the
factors
out
of
which
the
bodies
of
animals
and
plants
are
built
up
and
the
laws
of
their
distribution
among
the
all
the
processes
of
which
i
have
spoken
are
accomplished
by
means
of
and
in
the
one
which
occurs
in
fertilisation
if
we
could
watch
the
factors
segregating
from
each
other
in
or
even
if
by
microscopic
examination
we
could
recognize
this
multitudinous
diversity
of
composition
that
must
certainly
exist
among
the
of
all
ordinary
individuals
the
work
of
genetics
would
be
much
simpler
than
it
is
but
so
far
no
such
direct
method
of
observation
has
been
discovered
in
default
we
are
obliged
to
examine
the
constitution
of
the
by
experimental
breeding
so
contrived
that
each
mating
shall
test
the
composition
of
an
individual
in
one
or
more
chosen
respects
and
so
to
speak
sample
its
by
counting
the
number
of
each
kind
of
offspring
which
it
can
produce
but
cumbersome
as
this
method
must
necessarily
be
it
enables
us
to
put
questions
to
nature
which
never
have
been
put
before
she
it
has
been
said
is
an
unwilling
witness
our
questions
must
be
shaped
in
such
a
way
that
the
only
possible
answer
is
a
direct
yes
or
a
direct
no
by
putting
such
questions
we
have
received
some
astonishing
answers
which
go
far
below
the
surface
amazing
though
they
be
they
are
nevertheless
true
for
though
our
witness
may
prevaricate
she
can
not
lie
piecing
these
answers
together
getting
one
hint
from
this
experiment
and
another
from
that
we
begin
little
by
little
to
reconstruct
what
is
going
on
in
that
hidden
world
of
gametes
as
we
proceed
like
our
brethren
in
other
sciences
we
sometimes
receive
answers
which
seem
inconsistent
or
even
contradictory
but
by
degrees
a
sufficient
body
of
evidence
can
be
attained
to
show
what
is
the
rule
and
what
the
exception
my
purpose
today
must
be
to
speak
rather
of
the
regular
than
of
the
irregular
one
clear
exception
i
may
mention
castle
finds
that
in
a
cross
between
the
and
a
breed
ears
of
intermediate
length
are
produced
and
that
these
intermediates
breed
approximately
true
exceptions
in
general
must
be
discussed
elsewhere
nevertheless
if
i
may
throw
out
a
word
of
counsel
to
beginners
it
is
treasure
your
exceptions
when
there
are
none
the
work
gets
so
dull
that
no
one
cares
to
carry
it
further
keep
them
always
uncovered
and
in
sight
exceptions
are
like
the
rough
brickwork
of
a
growing
building
which
tells
that
there
is
more
to
come
and
shows
where
the
next
construction
is
to
be
you
will
readily
understand
that
the
presentation
here
given
of
the
phenomena
is
only
the
barest
possible
outline
some
of
the
details
we
may
now
fill
in
for
example
i
have
spoken
of
the
characters
of
the
organism
its
colour
shape
and
the
like
as
if
they
were
due
each
to
one
ingredient
or
factor
some
of
them
are
no
doubt
correctly
so
represented
but
already
we
know
numerous
bodily
features
which
need
the
concurrence
of
several
factors
to
produce
them
nevertheless
though
the
character
only
appears
when
all
the
complementary
ingredients
are
together
present
each
of
these
severally
and
independently
follows
as
regards
its
transmission
the
simple
rules
i
have
described
this
complementary
action
may
be
illustrated
by
some
curious
results
that
mr
punnett
and
i
have
encountered
when
experimenting
with
the
height
of
sweet
peas
there
are
two
dwarf
varieties
one
the
prostrate
cupid
the
other
the
or
bush
sweet
peas
crossed
together
they
give
a
of
full
height
there
is
thus
some
element
in
the
cupid
which
when
it
meets
the
complementary
element
from
the
bush
produces
the
characteristic
length
of
the
ordinary
sweet
pea
we
may
note
in
passing
that
such
a
fact
demonstrates
at
once
the
nature
of
variation
and
reversion
the
reversion
occurs
because
the
two
factors
that
made
the
of
the
old
sweet
pea
again
come
together
after
being
parted
and
the
variations
by
which
each
of
the
dwarfs
came
into
existence
must
have
taken
place
by
the
dropping
out
of
one
of
these
elements
or
of
the
other
conversely
there
are
factors
which
by
their
presence
can
prevent
or
inhibit
the
development
and
appearance
of
others
present
and
unperceived
for
example
all
the
factors
for
pigmentation
may
be
present
in
a
plant
or
an
animal
but
in
addition
there
may
be
another
factor
present
which
keeps
the
individual
white
or
nearly
so
there
are
cases
in
which
the
action
of
the
factors
is
superposed
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
not
until
each
factor
is
removed
in
turn
can
the
effects
of
the
underlying
factors
be
perceived
so
in
the
mouse
if
no
other
is
present
the
fur
is
chocolate
if
the
next
factor
in
the
series
be
there
it
is
black
if
still
another
factor
be
added
it
has
the
brownish
grey
of
the
common
wild
mouse
conversely
by
the
variation
which
dropped
out
the
top
factor
a
black
mouse
came
into
existence
by
the
loss
of
the
black
factor
the
chocolate
mouse
was
created
and
for
aught
we
can
tell
there
may
be
still
more
possibilities
hidden
beneath
in
the
disentanglement
of
the
properties
and
interactions
of
these
elementary
factors
the
science
we
must
call
to
our
aid
is
physiological
chemistry
the
relations
of
genetics
with
the
other
branches
of
biology
are
close
such
work
can
only
be
conducted
by
those
who
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
able
to
count
upon
continual
help
and
advice
from
specialists
in
the
various
branches
of
zoology
physiology
and
botany
often
we
have
questions
with
which
only
a
cytologist
can
deal
and
often
it
is
the
experience
of
a
systematist
we
must
invoke
the
school
of
genetics
in
cambridge
starts
under
happy
auspices
in
that
we
are
surrounded
by
colleagues
qualified
and
as
we
have
often
found
willing
to
give
us
such
aid
unstinted
but
with
chemical
physiology
we
stand
in
an
even
closer
relation
and
from
the
little
i
have
dared
to
say
respecting
the
action
and
interaction
of
factors
it
is
evident
that
for
their
disentanglement
there
must
one
day
be
an
intimate
and
enduring
partnership
arranged
with
the
physiological
chemists
now
as
the
whole
of
the
elaborate
process
by
which
the
various
elements
are
apportioned
among
the
gametes
must
be
got
through
in
a
few
at
most
and
perhaps
in
one
division
only
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
is
sometimes
an
interaction
between
factors
that
have
quite
distinct
rôles
to
perform
these
interactions
are
probably
of
several
kinds
one
which
i
shall
illustrate
presently
is
probably
to
be
represented
as
a
repulsion
between
two
factors
as
a
consequence
of
its
operations
when
the
various
factors
are
sorted
out
into
the
gametes
if
the
individual
be
in
respect
of
the
repelling
factors
having
received
so
to
speak
only
a
single
dose
of
each
then
the
gametes
are
made
up
in
such
a
way
that
each
takes
one
or
other
of
the
two
repelling
factors
not
both
mutual
repulsions
of
this
kind
probably
play
a
significant
part
in
the
phenomena
of
heredity
a
single
concrete
case
which
mr
punnett
and
i
have
been
investigating
for
some
years
will
illustrate
several
of
these
principles
we
crossed
together
a
pure
white
sweet
pea
having
an
erect
standard
with
another
pure
white
sweet
pea
having
a
hooded
standard
the
result
is
as
you
see
a
purple
flower
with
an
erect
standard
the
colour
comes
from
the
concurrence
of
complementary
elements
a
dose
of
a
certain
ingredient
from
one
parent
meets
a
dose
of
another
ingredient
from
the
other
parent
and
the
two
make
pigment
in
the
flower
from
other
experiments
we
know
that
the
colour
of
the
pigment
is
due
to
a
dose
of
a
third
ingredient
brought
in
from
the
hooded
parent
and
that
in
the
absence
of
that
blue
factor
as
we
may
call
it
the
flower
would
be
red
the
standard
is
erect
because
it
contains
a
dose
of
the
from
the
erect
parent
and
the
hooded
parent
can
readily
be
proved
to
owe
its
peculiar
shape
to
the
absence
of
that
element
our
purple
plant
is
thus
for
four
factors
containing
only
one
dose
of
each
we
let
it
fertilise
itself
and
its
offspring
show
all
the
possible
combinations
of
the
four
different
factors
and
their
absences
which
the
genetic
constitution
of
the
plant
can
make
note
that
one
of
the
combinations
we
expect
to
find
is
missing
there
are
white
erect
and
white
hooded
white
because
they
are
lacking
one
or
other
of
the
complementary
ingredients
necessary
to
the
production
of
pigment
there
are
purple
erect
and
purple
hooded
of
which
the
purple
erect
must
perforce
contain
all
the
four
factors
and
the
purple
hooded
must
similarly
contain
all
of
them
except
that
for
erectness
but
when
we
turn
to
the
red
class
we
are
surprised
to
find
that
they
are
all
erect
none
hooded
one
of
the
possible
combinations
is
missing
if
you
examine
this
series
of
facts
you
will
find
there
is
only
one
possible
interpretation
namely
that
the
ingredient
which
turns
the
flower
purple
alkalinity
perhaps
we
may
call
it
never
goes
into
the
same
as
the
ingredient
which
makes
the
standard
erect
there
are
plenty
of
ways
of
testing
the
truth
of
this
interpretation
for
example
it
follows
that
the
purple
erects
from
such
a
family
will
in
perpetuity
have
offspring
purple
hooded
purple
erect
red
erect
also
that
all
the
white
hooded
crossed
with
pure
reds
will
give
purples
and
so
on
these
experiments
have
been
made
and
the
result
has
in
each
case
been
conformable
to
expectation
between
these
two
factors
the
purpleness
and
the
erectness
of
standard
some
antagonism
or
repulsion
must
exist
in
some
way
therefore
the
chemical
and
the
geometrical
phenomena
of
heredity
must
be
some
one
will
say
perhaps
this
is
all
very
well
as
a
scientific
curiosity
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
real
life
the
right
answer
to
such
criticism
is
of
course
the
lofty
one
that
science
and
its
applications
are
distinct
that
the
investigator
fixes
his
gaze
solely
on
the
search
for
truth
and
that
his
attention
must
not
be
distracted
by
trivialities
of
application
but
while
we
make
this
answer
and
at
least
try
to
work
in
the
spirit
it
proclaims
we
know
in
our
hearts
that
it
is
a
counsel
of
perfection
i
suspect
that
even
the
astronomer
who
at
his
spectroscope
is
analysing
the
composition
of
vega
or
capella
has
still
an
eye
sometimes
free
for
the
affairs
of
this
planet
and
at
least
the
fact
that
his
discoveries
may
throw
light
on
our
destinies
does
not
diminish
his
zeal
in
their
pursuit
and
surely
to
the
study
of
heredity
preeminently
among
all
the
sciences
we
are
looking
for
light
on
human
destiny
to
pretend
otherwise
would
be
mere
hypocrisy
so
while
reserving
the
higher
line
of
defence
i
will
reply
that
again
and
again
in
our
experimental
work
we
come
very
near
indeed
to
human
affairs
sometimes
this
is
obvious
enough
no
practical
or
can
see
the
results
of
mendelian
recombination
without
perceiving
that
here
is
a
bit
of
knowledge
he
can
immediately
apply
no
sociologist
can
examine
the
pedigrees
illustrating
the
simple
descent
of
a
deformity
or
a
congenital
disease
and
not
see
that
the
new
knowledge
gives
a
solid
basis
for
practical
action
by
which
the
composition
of
a
race
could
be
modified
if
society
so
chose
more
than
this
we
know
for
certain
in
one
case
from
the
work
of
professor
biffen
that
the
power
to
resist
a
disease
caused
by
the
invasion
of
a
pathogenic
organism
is
due
to
the
absence
of
one
of
the
simple
factors
or
ingredients
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
what
we
know
to
be
true
in
that
one
case
we
are
beginning
to
suspect
to
be
true
of
resistance
to
certain
other
diseases
no
pathologist
can
see
such
an
experiment
as
this
of
professor
without
realizing
that
here
is
a
contribution
of
the
first
importance
to
the
physiology
of
disease
there
is
no
lack
of
utility
and
direct
application
in
the
study
of
genetics
i
have
alluded
to
some
strictly
practical
results
if
we
want
to
raise
mangels
that
will
not
run
to
seed
or
to
breed
a
cow
that
will
give
more
milk
in
less
time
or
milk
with
more
butter
and
less
water
we
can
turn
to
genetics
with
every
hope
that
something
can
be
done
in
these
laudable
directions
but
here
i
would
plead
what
i
can
not
but
regard
as
a
higher
usefulness
in
our
work
genetic
inquiry
aims
at
providing
knowledge
that
may
bring
and
i
think
will
bring
certainty
into
a
region
of
human
affairs
and
concepts
which
might
have
been
supposed
reserved
for
ages
to
be
the
domain
of
the
visionary
we
have
long
known
that
it
was
believed
by
some
that
our
powers
and
conduct
were
dependent
on
our
physical
composition
and
that
other
schools
have
maintained
that
nurture
not
nature
to
use
galton
antithesis
has
a
preponderating
influence
on
our
careers
but
so
soon
as
it
becomes
common
knowledge
not
a
philosophical
speculation
but
a
certainty
that
liability
to
a
disease
or
the
power
of
resisting
its
attack
addiction
to
a
particular
vice
or
to
superstition
is
due
to
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
specific
ingredient
and
finally
that
these
characteristics
are
transmitted
to
the
offspring
according
to
definite
predicable
rules
then
man
views
of
his
own
nature
his
conceptions
of
justice
in
short
his
whole
outlook
on
the
world
must
be
profoundly
changed
yet
as
regards
the
more
tangible
of
these
physical
and
mental
characteristics
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
before
many
years
have
passed
the
laws
of
their
transmission
will
be
expressible
in
simple
formulae
the
blundering
cruelty
we
call
criminal
justice
will
stand
forth
divested
of
natural
sanction
a
relic
of
the
ferocious
inventions
of
the
savage
well
may
such
justice
be
portrayed
as
blind
who
shall
say
whether
it
is
crime
or
punishment
which
has
wrought
the
greater
suffering
in
the
world
we
may
live
to
know
that
to
the
keen
satirical
vision
of
sam
butler
on
the
pleasant
mountains
of
erewhon
there
was
revealed
a
dispensation
not
kinder
only
but
wiser
than
the
terrific
code
which
moses
delivered
from
the
flames
of
sinai
if
there
are
societies
which
refuse
to
apply
the
new
knowledge
the
fault
will
not
lie
with
genetics
i
think
it
needs
but
little
observation
of
the
newer
civilisations
to
foresee
that
will
apply
every
scrap
of
scientific
knowledge
which
can
help
them
or
seems
to
help
them
in
the
struggle
and
i
am
good
enough
selectionist
to
know
that
in
that
day
the
fate
of
the
recalcitrant
communities
is
sealed
the
thrill
of
discovery
is
not
dulled
by
a
suspicion
that
the
discovery
can
be
applied
no
harm
is
done
to
the
investigator
if
he
can
resist
the
temptation
to
deviate
from
his
aim
with
rarest
exceptions
the
discoveries
which
have
formed
the
basis
of
physical
progress
have
been
made
without
any
thought
but
for
the
gratification
of
curiosity
of
this
there
can
be
few
examples
more
conspicuous
than
that
which
mendel
work
presents
untroubled
by
any
itch
to
make
potatoes
larger
or
bread
cheaper
he
set
himself
in
the
quiet
of
a
cloister
garden
to
find
out
the
laws
of
hybridity
and
so
struck
a
mine
of
truth
inexhaustible
in
brilliancy
and
profit
i
will
now
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
by
no
means
unlikely
that
even
in
an
inquiry
so
remote
as
that
which
i
just
described
in
the
case
of
the
sweet
pea
we
may
have
the
clue
to
a
mystery
which
concerns
us
all
in
the
closest
possible
way
i
mean
the
problem
of
the
physiological
nature
of
sex
in
speaking
of
the
interpretation
of
sexual
difference
suggested
by
our
experimental
work
as
of
some
practical
moment
i
do
not
imply
that
as
in
the
other
instances
i
have
given
the
knowledge
is
likely
to
be
of
immediate
use
to
our
species
but
only
that
if
true
it
makes
a
contribution
to
the
stock
of
human
ideas
which
no
one
can
regard
as
insignificant
in
the
light
of
mendelian
knowledge
when
a
family
consists
of
more
than
one
type
the
fact
means
that
the
of
one
or
other
parent
must
certainly
be
of
more
than
one
kind
in
the
case
of
sex
the
members
of
the
family
are
thus
of
two
kinds
and
the
presumption
is
overwhelming
that
this
distinction
is
due
to
a
difference
among
the
next
since
for
all
practical
purposes
the
numbers
of
the
two
sexes
produced
are
approximately
equal
sex
exhibits
the
special
case
in
which
a
family
consists
of
two
types
represented
in
equal
numbers
half
being
male
half
female
but
i
called
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
equality
of
types
results
when
parent
was
in
the
character
concerned
having
received
one
dose
only
of
the
factor
on
which
it
depends
so
we
may
feel
fairly
sure
that
the
distinction
between
the
sexes
depends
on
the
presence
in
one
or
other
of
them
of
an
unpaired
factor
this
conclusion
appears
to
me
to
follow
so
immediately
on
all
that
we
have
learnt
of
genetic
physiology
that
with
every
confidence
we
may
accept
it
as
representing
the
actual
fact
the
question
which
of
the
two
sexes
contains
the
unpaired
factor
is
less
easy
to
answer
but
there
are
several
converging
lines
of
evidence
which
point
to
the
deduction
that
in
vertebrates
at
least
and
in
some
other
types
it
is
the
female
and
i
feel
little
doubt
that
we
shall
succeed
in
proving
that
in
them
femaleness
is
a
definite
mendelian
factor
absent
from
the
male
and
following
the
ordinary
mendelian
rules
before
showing
you
how
the
sweet
pea
phenomenon
aids
in
this
inquiry
i
must
tell
you
of
some
other
experimental
results
the
first
concerns
the
common
currant
moth
it
has
a
definite
pale
variety
called
with
these
two
forms
doncaster
has
made
a
remarkable
series
of
experiments
when
he
began
was
only
known
as
a
female
form
this
was
crossed
with
the
male
and
gave
only
showing
that
the
male
was
pure
to
type
the
hybrids
bred
together
gave
males
and
females
and
females
only
but
the
hybrid
males
bred
to
females
produced
all
four
combinations
males
and
females
and
males
and
females
when
the
males
were
bred
to
females
whether
hybrid
or
wild
from
a
district
where
does
not
exist
the
result
was
that
all
the
males
were
and
all
the
females
it
is
difficult
to
follow
the
course
of
such
an
experiment
on
once
hearing
and
all
i
ask
you
to
remember
is
first
that
there
is
a
series
of
matings
giving
very
curious
distributions
of
the
characters
of
type
and
variety
among
the
two
sexes
and
then
what
is
perhaps
the
most
singular
fact
of
all
that
the
wild
typical
female
can
when
crossed
with
the
male
produce
all
females
this
last
fact
can
we
know
mean
only
one
thing
namely
that
these
wild
females
are
in
reality
hybrids
of
though
since
the
males
are
pure
that
fact
would
in
the
natural
course
of
things
never
be
revealed
when
we
encounter
such
a
series
of
phenomena
as
this
our
business
is
to
find
a
means
of
symbolical
expression
which
will
represent
all
the
factors
involved
and
show
how
each
behaves
in
descent
such
a
system
or
scheme
we
have
at
length
discovered
and
i
incline
to
think
that
it
must
be
the
true
one
if
you
study
this
case
you
will
find
that
there
are
nine
distinct
kinds
of
matings
that
can
be
made
between
the
variety
the
type
and
the
hybrid
and
the
scheme
fits
the
whole
group
of
results
it
is
based
on
two
suppositions
that
the
female
is
or
as
we
call
it
heterozygous
for
the
male
being
without
that
factor
the
eggs
are
thus
each
destined
from
the
first
to
become
either
males
or
females
but
as
regards
sex
the
spermatozoa
are
alike
in
being
that
there
is
a
repulsion
between
the
and
the
factor
such
a
repulsion
between
two
factors
we
are
justified
in
regarding
as
possible
because
we
have
had
proof
of
the
occurrence
of
a
similar
repulsion
in
the
case
of
the
two
factors
in
the
sweet
pea
if
the
case
of
this
moth
stood
alone
it
would
be
interesting
but
its
importance
is
greatly
increased
by
the
fact
that
we
know
two
cases
in
birds
which
are
closely
comparable
the
simpler
case
to
which
alone
i
shall
refer
has
been
observed
in
the
canary
like
the
currant
moth
it
has
a
kind
of
albino
called
cinnamon
and
males
of
this
variety
when
mated
with
ordinary
dark
green
hen
canaries
produce
dark
males
and
cinnamons
which
are
always
hens
while
the
green
male
and
the
cinnamon
hen
produce
nothing
but
greens
of
both
sexes
this
case
which
has
been
experimentally
studied
by
miss
durham
offers
a
certain
complication
but
in
its
main
outlines
it
is
exactly
like
that
of
the
moth
and
the
same
interpretation
is
applicable
to
both
the
particular
interpretation
may
be
imperfect
and
even
partially
wrong
but
that
we
are
at
last
able
to
form
a
working
idea
of
the
course
of
such
phenomena
at
all
is
a
most
encouraging
fact
if
we
are
right
as
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
we
get
a
glimpse
of
the
significance
of
the
popular
idea
that
in
certain
respects
daughters
are
apt
to
resemble
their
fathers
and
sons
their
mothers
a
phenomenon
which
is
certainly
sometimes
to
be
observed
there
are
several
collateral
indications
that
we
are
on
the
right
track
in
our
theory
of
the
nature
of
sex
one
of
these
derived
from
the
peculiar
inheritance
of
is
especially
interesting
that
affection
is
common
in
men
rare
in
women
men
who
are
can
transmit
the
affection
but
men
who
have
normal
vision
can
not
women
however
who
are
ostensibly
normal
may
have
sons
and
women
who
are
have
so
far
as
we
know
no
sons
who
are
not
mendelian
analysis
of
these
facts
shows
that
is
due
not
as
might
have
been
supposed
to
the
absence
of
something
from
the
composition
of
the
body
but
to
the
presence
of
something
which
affects
the
sight
just
as
can
paralyse
the
colour
sense
so
may
we
conceive
the
development
of
a
secretion
in
the
body
which
has
a
similar
action
the
comparative
exemption
of
the
woman
must
therefore
mean
that
there
is
in
her
a
positive
factor
which
counteracts
the
factor
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
counteracting
element
is
no
other
than
the
itself
i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
prove
that
after
all
those
curiosities
collected
from
observation
of
sweet
peas
and
canaries
have
no
remote
bearing
on
some
very
fascinating
problems
of
human
life
lastly
i
suppose
it
is
that
they
have
a
bearing
on
the
problem
of
evolution
the
facts
of
heredity
and
variation
are
the
materials
out
of
which
all
theories
of
evolution
are
constructed
at
last
by
genetic
methods
we
are
beginning
to
obtain
such
facts
of
unimpeachable
quality
and
free
from
the
flaws
that
were
inevitable
in
older
collections
from
a
survey
of
these
materials
we
see
something
of
the
changes
which
will
have
to
be
made
in
the
orthodox
edifice
to
admit
of
their
incorporation
but
he
must
be
rash
indeed
who
would
now
attempt
a
comprehensive
reconstruction
the
results
of
genetic
research
are
so
bewilderingly
novel
that
we
need
time
and
an
exhaustive
study
of
their
before
we
can
hope
to
see
them
in
proper
value
and
perspective
in
all
the
discussions
of
the
stability
and
fitness
of
species
who
ever
contemplated
the
possibility
of
a
wild
species
having
one
of
its
sexes
permanently
hybrid
when
i
spoke
of
adventures
to
be
encountered
in
genetic
research
i
was
thinking
of
such
astonishing
discoveries
as
that
there
are
others
no
less
disconcerting
who
would
have
supposed
it
possible
that
the
of
a
plant
could
be
all
of
one
type
and
its
of
two
types
yet
miss
saunders
experiments
have
provided
definite
proof
that
this
is
the
condition
of
certain
stocks
of
which
the
pollen
grains
all
bear
doubleness
while
the
are
some
singles
and
some
doubles
we
can
not
think
yet
of
interpreting
these
complex
phenomena
in
terms
of
a
common
plan
all
that
we
know
is
that
there
is
now
open
for
our
scrutiny
a
world
of
varied
orderly
and
specific
physiological
wonders
into
which
we
have
as
yet
only
peeped
to
lay
down
positive
propositions
as
to
the
origin
and
of
species
in
general
now
would
be
a
task
as
fruitless
as
that
of
a
chemist
must
have
been
who
had
tried
to
state
the
relationship
of
the
elements
before
their
properties
had
been
investigated
for
the
first
time
and
have
a
concrete
palpable
meaning
hitherto
they
have
stood
by
in
all
evolutionary
debates
convenient
genii
ready
to
perform
as
little
or
as
much
as
might
be
desired
by
the
conjuror
that
vaporous
stage
of
their
existence
is
over
and
we
see
variation
shaping
itself
as
a
definite
physiological
event
the
addition
or
omission
of
one
or
more
definite
elements
and
reversion
as
that
particular
addition
or
subtraction
which
brings
the
total
of
the
elements
back
to
something
it
had
been
before
in
the
history
of
the
race
the
time
for
discussion
of
evolution

a
