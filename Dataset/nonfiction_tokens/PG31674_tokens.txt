comments

the

with
description
of
a
new
subspecies
from
north

by
knox
jones
jr
in
the
past
several
years
the
united
states
national
museum
has
received
a
large
number
of
mammals
from
central
and
southern
korea
through
the
auspices
of
the
commission
on
hemorrhagic
fever
of
the
armed
forces
epidemiological
board
among
these
korean
collections
are
more
than
a
hundred
specimens
of
a
murine
rodent
originally
described
as
speciosus
by
oldfield
thomas
but
currently
placed
in
the
genus
in
attempting
to
ascertain
the
specific
relationships
of
this
mouse
i
have
examined
through
the
generosity
of
david
johnson
acting
curator
of
mammals
most
of
the
other
oriental
specimens
of
the
subgenus
in
the
national
museum
and
it
is
on
this
combined
material
that
the
following
comments
and
description
are
based
three
general
groups
of
the
genus
are
presently
known
to
occur
on
the
mainland
of
northeast
asia
one
is
the
distinctive
lone
representative
of
the
subgenus
the
others
both
in
the
subgenus
and
closely
resembling
each
other
are
represented
by
a
small
animal
that
is
currently
regarded
as
conspecific
with
and
a
larger
animal
of
which
the
korean
mouse
is
representative
the
oldest
trivial
name
applied
to
the
large
is
of
radde
in
the
combination
vrt
this
is
however
twice
preoccupied
see
ellerman
and
the
next
available
name
is
of
thomas
which
was
applied
to
mice
from
central
and
southern
korea
type
from
mi
se
seoul
korea
and
was
originally
proposed
as
a
subspecies
of
the
insular
japanese
species
allen
who
recognized
as
a
monotypic
species
was
the
first
investigator
to
make
the
important
distinction
that
it
was
not
conspecific
with
the
japanese
although
hollister
and
miller
had
previously
used
the
combination
evidently
with
the
same
thought
in
mind

have
arranged
as

subspecies

under
the
assumption
that
all
the
members
of
the
subgenus
on
the

are
subspecies
of
one

another
of
the
species

somewhat
arbitrary
manner
between
average
smaller

and

larger

occurring
together
nearly
throughout

feel
fairly
sure
that
there
are
some
errors
of
judgment
in
my
arrangement
and
equally
sure
that
there
is
no
other
way
to
define
species
in
this
very
large
and
difficult
group
i
have
compared
the
specimens
of
available
to
me
from
central
and
southern
korea
with
specimens
of
from
denmark
germany
and
sweden
and
find
although
the
two
are
similar
in
many
ways
that
differs
from
in
several
important
characters
mammae
in
and
in
incisive
foramina
reaching
level
of
alveoli
of
or
nearly
so
in
but
ending
conspicuously
short
of
that
level
in
posterior
palatine
foramina
large
in
and
opposite
a
point
where
and
meet
but
small
in
and
situated
farther
back
on
the
palate
opposite
moreover
lacks
the
characteristic
buffy
throat
patch
of
has
a
much
reduced
posterointernal
cusp
on
the
a
relatively
frequently
actually
larger
and
on
the
average
a
broader
mesopterygoid
fossa
in
view
of
these
differences
all
of
which
appear
to
be
constant
i
consider
specifically
distinct
from
throughout
its
known
geographic
range
see
below
is
evidently
confined
to
wooded
terrain
either
scrub
or
brush
types
or
forested
areas
and
the
vernacular
name
wood
mouse
therefore
seems
appropriate
for
this
species
the
type
specimens
of
miller
type
from
sungari
river
mi
sw
kirin
manchuria
and
hollister
type
from
tapucha
altai
mountains
siberia
agree
with
as
concerns
the
above
characters
and
differ
from
it
only
in
minor
external
and
cranial
features
they
are
therefore
here
considered
as
subspecies
of
the
latter
ellerman
and
ellerman
and
regarded
like
as
a
subspecies
of
the
subspecies
on
the
other
hand
has
generally
been
regarded
as
a
synonym
of
by
recent
authors
howell
noted
that
the
holotype
was
a
phenomenally
large
specimen
such
as
is
encountered
occasionally
in
almost
all
groups
of
rodents
he
ascribed
the
color
differences
noted
by
miller
to
seasonal
variation
the
holotype
of
is
undeniably
larger
than
the
other
adult
specimens
listed
in
the
original
description
these
paratypes
and
other
specimens
of
available
to
me
are
approximately
the
same
size
externally
and
average
only
slightly
larger
cranially
than
specimens
of
from
central
and
southern
korea
however
the
dorsal
coloration
of
is
somewhat
darker
and
duller
than
that
of
especially
in
summer
pelage
when
lacks
the
conspicuous
bright
ochraceous
tinge
of
the
korean
specimens
in
addition
has
broader
zygomatic
plates
with
correspondingly
deeper
zygomatic
notches
and
the
color
on
the
face
of
the
upper
incisors
averages
much
more
orange
than
in
in
the
north
then
wood
mice
range
from
korea
and
manchuria
westward
at
least
as
far
as
the
altai
mountains
for
mice
from
the
intervening
siberian
areas
russian
workers
have
used
the
name
which
as
noted
above
is
unavailable
the
exact
relationships
of
the
mice
of
these
areas
to
previously
named
subspecies
is
unknown
to
me
and
i
have
not
seen
specimens
of
alsomys
major
of
dukelsky
the
type
locality
of
which
is
versts
approximately
miles
se
vladivostok
siberia
it
appears
to
be
of
the
same
species
as
and
judging
from
the
original
description
it
closely
resembles
neither
have
i
seen
specimens
of
the
sakhalin
island
mouse
which
ellerman
regards
as
a
subspecies
of
i
feel
reasonably
sure
however
that
it
will
prove
to
be
a
subspecies
of
in
the
original
description
was
referred
to
as
most
closely
allied
to
the
korean
subspecies
thomas
in
china
the
extent
of
the
distribution
of
is
also
uncertain
allen
reported
its
occurrence
from
jehol
and
hopeh
in
the
northeast
southwestward
through
shansi
shensi
and
eastern
kansu
to
szechuan
and
northwestern
yunnan
throughout
most
of
this
region
it
occurs
with
another
mouse
currently
regarded
as
conspecific
with
and
the
two
kinds
have
been
confused
by
some
previous
authors
howell
for
instance
reported
twelve
specimens
of
from
mi
ne
peking
but
my
examination
of
these
mice
indicates
that
only
four
are
while
the
others
are
referrable
to
what
is
currently
regarded
as
sylvaticus
another
subspecies
of
occurs
in
szechuan
and
yunnan
and
it
is
certain
that
some
records
of
distribution
ascribed
to
from
those
provinces
actually
represent
see
allen
is
distinguishable
from
by
darker
ears
blackish
preauricular
patches
dark
eye
rings
a
noticeably
smaller
skull
incisive
foramina
that
reach
the
level
of
ml
or
nearly
so
much
larger
auditory
bullae
and
a
more
fully
developed
posterointernal
cusp
on
too
typically
has
mammae
although
allen
reports
finding
a
formula
in
some
specimens
regarded
as
a
full
species
by
osgood
and
allen
but
as
a
subspecies
of
by
ellerman
and
ellerman
and
also
occurs
in
szechuan
and
yunnan
its
relatively
dark
color
large
feet
and
large
ears
skull
and
large
molar
teeth
immediately
separate
it
from
although
the
two
possibly
have
been
confused
in
the
earlier
literature
until
a
complete
revisionary
study
of
the
asiatic
members
of
the
subgenus
can
be
undertaken
the
presence
of
in
southwestern
china
must
remain
in
question
the
western
limits
of
the
geographic
range
of
are
unknown
thomas
from
nepal
is
said
to
have
mammae
but
the
description
is
not
otherwise
suggestive
of
close
relationship
to
farther
to
the
west
flavicollis

to
have
been
properly
assigned
as
a
subspecies

cotypes
