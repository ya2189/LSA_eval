preface
by
joseph
mccabe
the
work
which
we
now
place
within
the
reach
of
every
reader
of
the
english
tongue
is
one
of
the
finest
productions
of
its
distinguished
author
the
first
edition
appeared
in
at
that
time
the
conviction
of
natural
evolution
was
even
less
advanced
in
germany
than
in
england
and
the
work
raised
a
storm
of
controversy
the
commonest
facts
of
our
individual
with
the
most
profound
disdain
of
the
theory
that
a
luther
or
a
goethe
could
be
the
outcome
of
development
from
a
tiny
speck
of
protoplasm
the
work
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
them
said
was
fleck
of
shame
on
the
escutcheon
of
its
conclusion
is
accepted
by
influential
clerics
such
as
the
dean
of
westminster
and
by
almost
every
biologist
and
anthropologist
of
distinction
in
europe
evolution
is
not
a
laboriously
reached
conclusion
but
a
guiding
truth
in
biological
literature
there
was
ample
evidence
to
substantiate
the
conclusion
even
in
the
first
edition
of
the
book
but
fresh
facts
have
come
to
light
in
each
decade
always
enforcing
the
general
truth
of
evolution
and
at
times
making
clearer
the
line
of
development
professor
haeckel
embodied
these
in
successive
editions
of
his
work
in
the
fifth
edition
of
which
this
is
a
translation
reference
will
be
found
to
the
very
latest
facts
bearing
on
the
evolution
of
man
such
as
the
discovery
of
the
remarkable
effect
of
mixing
human
blood
with
that
of
the
anthropoid
ape
moreover
the
ample
series
of
illustrations
has
been
considerably
improved
and
enlarged
there
is
no
scientific
work
published
at
a
price
remotely
approaching
that
of
the
present
edition
with
so
abundant
and
excellent
a
supply
of
illustrations
when
it
was
issued
in
germany
a
few
years
ago
a
distinguished
biologist
wrote
in
the
that
it
would
secure
immortality
for
its
author
the
most
notable
critic
of
the
idea
of
immortality
and
the
reviewer
described
the
english
version
as
a
edition
of
monumental
work
and
issue
worthy
of
the
subject
and
the
the
influence
of
such
a
work
one
of
the
most
constructive
that
haeckel
has
ever
written
should
extend
to
more
than
the
few
hundred
readers
who
are
able
to
purchase
the
expensive
volumes
of
the
original
issue
few
pages
in
the
story
of
science
are
more
arresting
and
generally
instructive
than
this
great
picture
of
in
the
the
horizon
of
the
mind
is
healthily
expanded
as
we
follow
the
of
science
down
the
vast
avenues
of
past
time
and
gaze
on
the
uncouth
forms
that
enter
into
or
illustrate
the
line
of
our
ancestry
and
if
the
imagination
recoils
from
the
strange
and
remote
figures
that
are
lit
up
by
our
and
hesitates
to
accept
them
as
ancestral
forms
science
draws
aside
another
veil
and
reveals
another
picture
to
us
it
shows
us
that
each
of
us
passes
in
our
embryonic
development
through
a
series
of
forms
hardly
less
uncouth
and
unfamiliar
nay
it
traces
a
parallel
between
the
two
series
of
forms
it
shows
us
man
beginning
his
existence
in
the
ovary
of
the
female
infant
as
a
minute
and
simple
speck
of
plasm
it
shows
us
from
analogy
the
fertilised
ovum
breaking
into
a
cluster
of
cohering
cells
and
folding
and
curving
until
the
fœtus
looks
like
a
body
it
then
points
out
how
and
corresponding
appear
as
in
a
lowly
fish
and
the
extremities
bud
out
and
grow
into
limbs
and
so
on
until
after
a
very
clear
the
definite
human
form
emerges
from
the
series
of
transformations
it
is
with
this
embryological
evidence
for
our
evolution
that
the
present
volume
is
concerned
there
are
illustrations
in
the
work
that
will
make
the
point
clear
at
a
glance
possibly
clear
for
the
simplicity
of
the
idea
and
the
eagerness
to
apply
it
at
every
point
have
carried
many
who
borrow
hastily
from
haeckel
out
of
their
scientific
depth
haeckel
has
never
shared
their
errors
nor
encouraged
their
superficiality
he
insists
from
the
outset
that
a
complete
parallel
could
not
possibly
be
expected
embryonic
life
itself
is
subject
to
evolution
though
there
is
a
general
and
substantial
most
of
our
english
and
american
authorities
the
embryonic
series
of
forms
recalls
the
ancestral
series
of
forms
the
parallel
is
blurred
throughout
and
often
distorted
it
is
not
the
obvious
resemblance
of
the
embryos
of
different
animals
and
their
general
similarity
to
our
extinct
ancestors
in
this
or
that
organ
on
which
we
must
rest
our
case
a
careful
study
must
be
made
of
the
various
stages
through
which
all
embryos
pass
and
an
effort
made
to
prove
their
real
identity
and
therefore
genealogical
relation
this
is
a
task
of
great
subtlety
and
delicacy
many
scientists
have
worked
at
it
together
with
professor
need
only
name
our
own
professor
balfour
and
professor
ray
the
scheme
is
fairly
complete
but
the
general
reader
must
not
expect
that
even
so
clear
a
writer
as
haeckel
can
describe
these
intricate
processes
without
demanding
his
very
careful
attention
most
of
the
chapters
in
the
present
volume
and
the
second
volume
will
be
less
difficult
are
easily
intelligible
to
all
but
there
are
points
at
which
the
line
of
argument
is
necessarily
subtle
and
complex
in
the
hope
that
most
readers
will
be
induced
to
master
even
these
more
difficult
chapters
i
will
give
an
outline
of
the
characteristic
argument
of
the
work
distinctive
services
in
regard
to
evolution
have
been
the
construction
of
a
complete
ancestral
tree
though
of
course
some
of
the
stages
in
it
are
purely
conjectural
and
not
final
the
tracing
of
the
remarkable
reproduction
of
ancestral
forms
in
the
embryonic
development
of
the
individual
naturally
he
has
not
worked
alone
in
either
department
the
second
volume
of
this
work
will
embody
the
first
of
these
two
achievements
the
present
one
is
mainly
concerned
with
the
latter
it
will
be
useful
for
the
reader
to
have
a
synopsis
of
the
argument
and
an
explanation
of
some
of
the
chief
terms
invented
or
employed
by
the
author
the
main
theme
of
the
work
is
that
in
the
course
of
their
embryonic
development
all
animals
including
man
pass
roughly
and
rapidly
through
a
series
of
forms
which
represents
the
succession
of
their
ancestors
in
the
past
after
a
severe
and
extensive
study
of
embryonic
phenomena
haeckel
has
drawn
up
a
in
the
ordinary
scientific
sense
to
this
effect
and
has
called
it
biogenetic
law
or
the
chief
law
relating
to
the
evolution
of
life
this
law
is
widely
and
increasingly
accepted
by
embryologists
and
zoologists
it
is
enough
to
quote
a
recent
declaration
of
the
great
american
zoologist
president
starr
jordan
is
of
course
true
that
the
of
the
individual
is
an
epitome
of
the
of
the
while
a
distinguished
german
zoologist
sarasin
has
described
it
as
being
of
the
same
use
to
the
biologist
as
spectrum
analysis
is
to
the
astronomer
but
the
reproduction
of
ancestral
forms
in
the
course
of
the
embryonic
development
is
by
no
means
always
clear
or
even
always
present
many
of
the
embryonic
phases
do
not
recall
ancestral
stages
at
all
they
may
have
done
so
originally
but
we
must
remember
that
the
embryonic
life
itself
has
been
subject
to
adaptive
changes
for
millions
of
years
all
this
is
clearly
explained
by
professor
haeckel
for
the
moment
i
would
impress
on
the
reader
the
vital
importance
of
fixing
the
distinction
from
the
start
he
must
thoroughly
familiarise
himself
with
the
meaning
of
five
terms
is
the
development
of
life
in
general
both
in
the
individual
and
the
species
or
the
sciences
describing
it
is
the
development
embryonic
and
of
the
individual
or
the
science
describing
it
is
the
development
of
the
race
or
stem
or
the
science
describing
it
roughly
may
be
taken
to
mean
embryology
and
what
we
generally
call
evolution
further
the
embryonic
phenomena
sometimes
reproduce
ancestral
forms
and
they
are
then
called
from
again
sometimes
they
do
not
recall
ancestral
forms
but
are
later
modifications
due
to
adaptation
and
they
are
then
called
from
new
or
foreign
these
terms
are
now
widely
used
but
the
reader
of
haeckel
must
understand
them
thoroughly
the
first
five
chapters
are
an
easy
account
of
the
history
of
embryology
and
evolution
the
sixth
and
seventh
give
an
equally
clear
account
of
the
sexual
elements
and
the
process
of
conception
but
some
of
the
succeeding
chapters
must
deal
with
embryonic
processes
so
unfamiliar
and
pursue
them
through
so
wide
a
range
of
animals
in
a
brief
space
that
in
spite
of
the
illustrations
they
will
offer
difficulty
to
many
a
reader
as
our
aim
is
to
secure
not
a
superficial
acquiescence
in
conclusions
but
a
fair
comprehension
of
the
truths
of
science
we
have
retained
these
chapters
however
i
will
give
a
brief
and
clear
outline
of
the
argument
so
that
the
reader
with
little
leisure
may
realise
their
value
when
the
animal
ovum
has
been
fertilised
it
divides
and
subdivides
until
we
have
a
cluster
of
cohering
cells
externally
not
unlike
a
raspberry
or
mulberry
this
is
the
mulberry
stage
the
cluster
becomes
hollow
or
filled
with
fluid
in
the
centre
all
the
cells
rising
to
the
surface
this
is
the
hollow
ball
stage
one
half
of
the
cluster
then
bends
or
folds
in
upon
the
other
as
one
might
do
with
a
thin
indiarubber
ball
and
we
get
a
body
with
hollow
interior
the
first
stomach
or
an
open
mouth
the
first
or
and
a
wall
composed
of
two
layers
of
cells
two
this
is
the
stomach
stage
and
the
process
of
its
formation
is
called
a
glance
at
the
illustration
fig
will
make
this
perfectly
clear
so
much
for
the
embryonic
process
in
itself
the
application
to
evolution
has
been
a
long
and
laborious
task
briefly
it
was
necessary
to
show
that
the
multicellular
animals
passed
through
these
three
stages
so
that
our
biogenetic
law
would
enable
us
to
recognise
them
as
reminiscences
of
ancestral
forms
this
is
the
work
of
chapters
viii
and
ix
the
difficulty
can
be
realised
in
this
way
as
we
reach
the
higher
animals
the
ovum
has
to
take
up
a
large
quantity
of
yelk
on
which
it
may
feed
in
developing
think
of
the
the
effect
of
this
was
to
flatten
the
germ
the
and
from
the
first
and
so
give
at
first
sight
a
totally
different
complexion
to
what
it
has
in
the
lowest
animals
when
we
pass
the
reptile
and
bird
stage
the
large
yelk
almost
disappears
the
germ
now
being
supplied
with
blood
by
the
mother
but
the
germ
has
been
permanently
altered
in
shape
and
there
are
now
a
number
of
new
embryonic
processes
membranes
connections
thus
it
was
no
light
task
to
trace
the
identity
of
this
process
of
in
all
the
animals
it
has
been
done
however
and
with
this
introduction
the
reader
will
be
able
to
follow
the
proof
the
conclusion
is
important
if
all
animals
pass
through
the
curious
gastrula
stage
it
must
be
because
they
all
had
a
common
ancestor
of
that
nature
to
this
conjectural
ancestor
it
lived
before
the
period
of
fossilisation
begins
haeckel
gives
the
name
of
the
and
in
the
second
volume
we
shall
see
a
number
of
living
animals
of
this
type
the
line
of
argument
is
the
same
in
the
next
chapter
after
laborious
and
careful
research
though
this
stage
is
not
generally
admitted
in
the
same
sense
as
the
previous
one
a
fourth
common
stage
was
discovered
and
given
the
name
of
the
the
blastula
had
one
layer
of
cells
the
skin
the
gastrula
two
layers
the
and
now
a
third
layer
middle
skin
is
formed
by
the
growth
inwards
of
two
pouches
or
folds
of
the
skin
the
pouches
blend
together
and
form
a
single
cavity
the
body
cavity
or
cœlom
and
its
two
walls
are
two
fresh
again
the
identity
of
the
process
has
to
be
proved
in
all
the
higher
classes
of
animals
and
when
this
is
done
we
have
another
ancestral
stage
the
the
remaining
task
is
to
build
up
the
complex
frame
of
the
higher
showing
the
identity
of
the
process
on
which
the
evolutionary
argument
depends
in
enormously
different
conditions
of
embryonic
of
the
four
chapter
ix
prepares
us
for
the
work
by
giving
us
a
very
clear
account
of
the
essential
structure
of
the
vertebrate
animal
and
the
probable
common
ancestor
of
all
the
vertebrates
a
small
fish
of
the
lancelet
type
chapters
then
carry
out
the
construction
step
by
step
the
work
is
now
simpler
in
the
sense
that
we
leave
all
the
invertebrate
animals
out
of
account
but
there
are
so
many
organs
to
be
fashioned
out
of
the
four
simple
layers
that
the
reader
must
proceed
carefully
in
the
second
volume
each
of
these
organs
will
be
dealt
with
separately
and
the
parallel
will
be
worked
out
between
its
embryonic
and
its
phylogenetic
evolutionary
development
the
general
reader
may
wait
for
this
for
a
full
understanding
but
in
the
meantime
the
wonderful
story
of
the
construction
of
all
our
organs
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
human
frame
is
perfectly
formed
though
less
than
two
inches
in
length
by
the
twelfth
week
from
so
simple
a
material
is
full
of
interest
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
summarise
the
process
the
four
chapters
are
themselves
but
a
summary
of
it
and
the
eighty
fine
illustrations
of
the
process
will
make
it
sufficiently
clear
the
last
chapter
carries
the
story
on
to
the
point
where
man
at
last
parts
company
with
the
anthropoid
ape
and
gives
a
full
account
of
the
membranes
or
wrappers
that
enfold
him
in
the
womb
and
the
connection
with
the
mother
in
conclusion
i
would
urge
the
reader
to
consult
at
his
free
library
perhaps
the
complete
edition
of
this
work
when
he
has
read
the
present
abbreviated

much
of
the
text
has
had
to
be

in
order
to
bring
out
the

at

and
the
beautiful

i
would
introduce
my
readers
in
the
following
chapters
has
a
quite
peculiar
place
in
the
broad
realm
of
scientific
inquiry
there
is
no
object
of

that
touches

more
closely

the

of

should
be
more
acceptable
to
him
than

the
various
branches
of

or
the
story
of
his

by

must
excite
the
most
lively
interest
it
gives
us
the
key
of
the
great
at
which
the
human
mind
has
been
working
for
thousands
of
years
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
man
or
the
question
of
place
in
nature
and
the
cognate
inquiries
as
to
the
past
the
earliest
history
the
present
situation
and
the
future
of
these
most
important
questions
are
directly
and
intimately
connected
with
that
branch
of
study
which
we
call
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
man
or
in
one
word
the
genesis
of
man
yet
it
is
an
astonishing
fact
that
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
man
does
not
even
yet
form
part
of
the
scheme
of
general
education
in
fact
educated
people
even
in
our
day
are
for
the
most
part
quite
ignorant
of
the
important
truths
and
remarkable
phenomena
which
anthropogeny
teaches
us
as
an
illustration
of
this
curious
state
of
things
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
most
of
what
are
considered
to
be
people
do
not
know
that
every
human
being
is
developed
from
an
egg
or
ovum
and
that
this
egg
is
one
simple
cell
like
any
other
plant
or
animal
egg
they
are
equally
ignorant
that
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
this
tiny
round
there
is
first
formed
a
body
that
is
totally
different
from
the
human
frame
and
has
not
the
remotest
resemblance
to
it
most
of
them
have
never
seen
such
a
human
embryo
in
the
earlier
period
of
its
development
and
do
not
know
that
it
is
quite
indistinguishable
from
other
animal
embryos
at
first
the
embryo
is
no
more
than
a
round
cluster
of
cells
then
it
becomes
a
simple
hollow
sphere
the
wall
of
which
is
composed
of
a
layer
of
cells
later
it
approaches
very
closely
at
one
period
to
the
anatomic
structure
of
the
lancelet
afterwards
to
that
of
a
fish
and
again
to
the
typical
build
of
the
amphibia
and
mammals
as
it
continues
to
develop
a
form
appears
which
is
like
those
we
find
at
the
lowest
stage
of
such
as
the
then
a
form
that
resembles
the
marsupials
and
only
at
a
late
stage
a
form
that
has
a
resemblance
to
the
ape
until
at
last
the
definite
human
form
emerges
and
closes
the
series
of
transformations
these
suggestive
facts
are
as
i
said
still
almost
unknown
to
the
general
completely
unknown
that
if
one
casually
mentions
them
they
are
called
in
question
or
denied
outright
as
everybody
knows
that
the
butterfly
emerges
from
the
pupa
and
the
pupa
from
a
quite
different
thing
called
a
larva
and
the
larva
from
the
egg
but
few
besides
medical
men
are
aware
that
in
the
course
of
his
individual
formation
passes
through
a
series
of
transformations
which
are
not
less
surprising
and
wonderful
than
the
familiar
metamorphoses
of
the
butterfly
the
mere
description
of
these
remarkable
changes
through
which
man
passes
during
his
embryonic
life
should
arouse
considerable
interest
but
the
mind
will
experience
a
far
keener
satisfaction
when
we
trace
these
curious
facts
to
their
causes
and
when
we
learn
to
behold
in
them
natural
phenomena
which
are
of
the
highest
importance
throughout
the
whole
field
of
human
knowledge
they
throw
light
first
of
all
on
the
history
of
creation
then
on
psychology
or
science
of
the
soul
and
through
this
on
the
whole
of
philosophy
and
as
the
general
results
of
every
branch
of
inquiry
are
summed
up
in
philosophy
all
the
sciences
come
in
turn
to
be
touched
and
influenced
more
or
less
by
the
study
of
the
evolution
of
man
but
when
i
say
that
i
propose
to
present
here
the
most
important
features
of
these
phenomena
and
trace
them
to
their
causes
i
take
the
term
and
i
interpret
my
task
in
a
very
much
wider
sense
than
is
usual
the
lectures
which
have
been
delivered
on
this
subject
in
the
universities
during
the
last
are
almost
exclusively
adapted
to
medical
men
certainly
the
medical
man
has
the
greatest
interest
in
studying
the
origin
of
the
human
body
with
which
he
is
daily
occupied
but
i
must
not
give
here
this
special
description
of
the
embryonic
processes
such
as
it
has
hitherto
been
given
as
most
of
my
readers
have
not
studied
anatomy
and
are
not
likely
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
the
adult
organism
i
must
content
myself
with
giving
some
parts
of
the
subject
only
in
general
outline
and
must
not
enter
upon
all
the
marvellous
but
very
intricate
and
not
easily
described
details
that
are
found
in
the
story
of
the
development
of
the
human
frame
to
understand
these
fully
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
is
needed
i
will
endeavour
to
be
as
plain
as
possible
in
dealing
with
this
branch
of
science
indeed
a
sufficient
general
idea
of
the
course
of
the
embryonic
development
of
man
can
be
obtained
without
going
too
closely
into
the
anatomic
details
i
trust
we
may
be
able
to
arouse
the
same
interest
in
this
delicate
field
of
inquiry
as
has
been
excited
already
in
other
branches
of
science
though
we
shall
meet
more
obstacles
here
than
elsewhere
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
man
as
it
has
hitherto
been
expounded
to
medical
students
has
usually
been
confined
to
correctly
the
science
of
the
development
of
the
individual
human
organism
but
this
is
really
only
the
first
part
of
our
task
the
first
half
of
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
man
in
that
wider
sense
in
which
we
understand
it
here
we
must
add
as
the
second
another
and
not
less
important
and
interesting
branch
of
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
the
human
this
may
be
described
as
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
the
various
animal
forms
from
which
the
human
organism
has
been
developed
in
the
course
of
countless
ages
everybody
now
knows
of
the
great
scientific
activity
that
was
occasioned
by
the
publication
of
of
in
the
chief
direct
consequence
of
this
publication
was
to
provoke
a
fresh
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
the
human
race
and
this
has
proved
beyond
question
our
gradual
evolution
from
the
lower
species
we
give
the
name
of
to
the
science
which
describes
this
ascent
of
man
from
the
lower
ranks
of
the
animal
world
the
chief
source
that
it
draws
upon
for
facts
is
or
embryology
the
science
of
the
development
of
the
individual
organism
moreover
it
derives
a
good
deal
of
support
from
paleontology
or
the
science
of
fossil
remains
and
even
more
from
comparative
anatomy
or
these
two
branches
of
our
the
one
side
ontogeny
or
embryology
and
on
the
other
phylogeny
or
the
science
of
most
vitally
connected
the
one
can
not
be
understood
without
the
other
it
is
only
when
the
two
branches
fully
and
supplement
each
other
that
or
the
science
of
the
genesis
of
life
in
the
widest
sense
attains
to
the
rank
of
a
philosophic
science
the
connection
between
them
is
not
external
and
superficial
but
profound
intrinsic
and
causal
this
is
a
discovery
made
by
recent
research
and
it
is
most
clearly
and
correctly
expressed
in
the
comprehensive
law
which
i
have
called
fundamental
law
of
organic
evolution
or
fundamental
law
of
this
general
law
to
which
we
shall
find
ourselves
constantly
recurring
and
on
the
recognition
of
which
depends
whole
insight
into
the
story
of
evolution
may
be
briefly
expressed
in
the
phrase
history
of
the
fœtus
is
a
recapitulation
of
the
history
of
the
or
in
other
words
is
a
recapitulation
of
it
may
be
more
fully
stated
as
follows
the
series
of
forms
through
which
the
individual
organism
passes
during
its
development
from
the
ovum
to
the
complete
bodily
structure
is
a
brief
condensed
repetition
of
the
long
series
of
forms
which
the
animal
ancestors
of
the
said
organism
or
the
ancestral
forms
of
the
species
have
passed
through
from
the
earliest
period
of
organic
life
down
to
the
present
day
the
causal
character
of
the
relation
which
connects
embryology
with
is
due
to
the
action
of
heredity
and
adaptation
when
we
have
rightly
understood
these
and
recognised
their
great
importance
in
the
formation
of
organisms
we
can
go
a
step
further
and
say
phylogenesis
is
the
mechanical
cause
of
ontogenesis
in
other
words
the
development
of
the
stem
or
race
is
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
heredity
and
adaptation
the
cause
of
all
the
changes
which
appear
in
a
condensed
form
in
the
evolution
of
the
fœtus
the
term
which
occurs
throughout
means
of
course
or
origin
from
this
we
get
biogeny
the
origin
of
life
anthropogeny
the
origin
of
man
ontogeny
the
origin
of
the
individual
phylogeny
the
origin
of
the
species
and
so
on
in
each
case
the
term
may
refer
to
the
process
itself
or
to
the
science
describing
the
the
chain
of
manifold
animal
forms
which
represent
the
ancestry
of
each
higher
organism
or
even
of
man
according
to
the
theory
of
descent
always
form
a
connected
whole
we
may
designate
this
uninterrupted
series
of
forms
with
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
a
b
c
d
e
to
z
in
apparent
contradiction
to
what
i
have
said
the
story
of
the
development
of
the
individual
or
the
ontogeny
of
most
organisms
only
offers
to
the
observer
a
part
of
these
forms
so
that
the
defective
series
of
embryonic
forms
would
run
a
b
d
f
h
k
m
etc
or
in
other
cases
b
d
h
l
m
n
etc
here
then
as
a
rule
several
of
the
evolutionary
forms
of
the
original
series
have
fallen
out
moreover
we
often
continue
with
our
illustration
from
the
or
other
of
the
original
letters
of
the
ancestral
series
represented
by
corresponding
letters
from
a
different
alphabet
thus
instead
of
the
roman
b
and
d
we
often
have
the
greek
β
and
δ
in
this
case
the
text
of
the
biogenetic
law
has
been
corrupted
just
as
it
had
been
abbreviated
in
the
preceding
case
but
in
spite
of
all
this
the
series
of
ancestral
forms
remains
the
same
and
we
are
in
a
position
to
discover
its
original
complexion
in
reality
there
is
always
a
certain
parallel
between
the
two
evolutionary
series
but
it
is
obscured
from
the
fact
that
in
the
embryonic
succession
much
is
wanting
that
certainly
existed
in
the
earlier
ancestral
succession
if
the
parallel
of
the
two
series
were
complete
and
if
this
great
fundamental
law
affirming
the
causal
connection
between
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
were
directly
demonstrable
we
should
only
have
to
determine
by
means
of
the
microscope
and
the
dissecting
knife
the
series
of
forms
through
which
the
fertilised
ovum
passes
in
its
development
we
should
then
have
before
us
a
complete
picture
of
the
remarkable
series
of
forms
which
our
animal
ancestors
have
successively
assumed
from
the
dawn
of
organic
life
down
to
the
appearance
of
man
but
such
a
repetition
of
the
ancestral
history
by
the
individual
in
its
embryonic
life
is
very
rarely
complete
we
do
not
often
find
our
full
alphabet
in
most
cases
the
correspondence
is
very
imperfect
being
greatly
distorted
and
falsified
by
causes
which
we
will
consider
later
we
are
thus
for
the
most
part
unable
to
determine
in
detail
from
the
study
of
its
embryology
all
the
different
shapes
which
an
ancestors
have
assumed
we
especially
in
the
case
of
the
human
many
gaps
it
is
true
that
we
can
fill
up
most
of
these
gaps
satisfactorily
with
the
help
of
comparative
anatomy
but
we
can
not
do
so
from
direct
embryological
observation
hence
it
is
important
that
we
find
a
large
number
of
lower
animal
forms
to
be
still
represented
in
the
course
of
embryonic
development
in
these
cases
we
may
draw
our
conclusions
with
the
utmost
security
as
to
the
nature
of
the
ancestral
form
from
the
features
of
the
form
which
the
embryo
momentarily
assumes
to
give
a
few
examples
we
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
the
human
ovum
is
a
simple
cell
that
the
first
ancestor
of
our
species
was
a
tiny
unicellular
being
something
like
the
amœba
in
the
same
way
we
know
from
the
fact
that
the
human
fœtus
consists
at
the
first
of
two
simple
the
that
the
a
form
with
two
such
layers
was
certainly
in
the
line
of
our
ancestry
a
later
human
embryonic
form
the
points
just
as
clearly
to
a
ancestor
the
the
nearest
living
relation
of
which
is
found
among
the
actual
ascidiæ
to
this
succeeds
a
most
important
embryonic
stage
in
which
our
headless
fœtus
presents
in
the
main
the
structure
of
the
lancelet
but
we
can
only
indirectly
and
approximately
with
the
aid
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
conjecture
what
lower
forms
enter
into
the
chain
of
our
ancestry
between
the
gastræa
and
the
chordula
and
between
this
and
the
lancelet
in
the
course
of
the
historical
development
many
intermediate
structures
have
gradually
fallen
out
which
must
certainly
have
been
represented
in
our
ancestry
but
in
spite
of
these
many
and
sometimes
very
appreciable
gaps
there
is
no
contradiction
between
the
two
successions
in
fact
it
is
the
chief
purpose
of
this
work
to
prove
the
real
harmony
and
the
original
parallelism
of
the
two
i
hope
to
show
on
a
substantial
basis
of
facts
that
we
can
draw
most
important
conclusions
as
to
our
genealogical
tree
from
the
actual
and
series
of
embryonic
changes
we
shall
then
be
in
a
position
to
form
a
general
idea
of
the
wealth
of
animal
forms
which
have
figured
in
the
direct
line
of
our
ancestry
in
the
lengthy
history
of
organic
life
in
this
evolutionary
appreciation
of
the
facts
of
embryology
we
must
of
course
take
particular
care
to
distinguish
sharply
and
clearly
between
the
primitive
palingenetic
or
ancestral
evolutionary
processes
and
those
due
to
cenogenesis
by
processes
or
embryonic
we
understand
all
those
phenomena
in
the
development
of
the
individual
which
are
transmitted
from
one
generation
to
another
by
heredity
and
which
on
that
account
allow
us
to
draw
direct
inferences
as
to
corresponding
structures
in
the
development
of
the
species
on
the
other
hand
we
give
the
name
of
processes
or
embryonic
to
all
those
phenomena
in
the
fœtal
development
that
can
not
be
traced
to
inheritance
from
earlier
species
but
are
due
to
the
adaptation
of
the
fœtus
or
the
to
certain
conditions
of
its
embryonic
development
these
cenogenetic
phenomena
are
foreign
or
later
additions
they
allow
us
to
draw
no
direct
inference
whatever
as
to
corresponding
processes
in
our
ancestral
history
but
rather
hinder
us
from
doing
so
palingenesis
new
birth
or
again
or
development
hence
its
application
to
the
phenomena
which
are
recapitulated
by
heredity
from
earlier
ancestral
forms
cenogenesis
foreign
or
negligible
development
and
hence
those
phenomena
which
come
later
in
the
story
of
life
to
disturb
the
inherited
structure
by
a
fresh
adaptation
to
this
careful
discrimination
between
the
primary
or
palingenetic
processes
and
the
secondary
or
cenogenetic
is
of
great
importance
for
the
purposes
of
the
scientific
history
of
a
species
which
has
to
draw
conclusions
from
the
available
facts
of
embryology
comparative
anatomy
and
paleontology
as
to
the
processes
in
the
formation
of
the
species
in
the
remote
past
it
is
of
the
same
importance
to
the
student
of
evolution
as
the
careful
distinction
between
genuine
and
spurious
texts
in
the
works
of
an
ancient
writer
or
the
purging
of
the
real
text
from
interpolations
and
alterations
is
for
the
student
of
philology
it
is
true
that
this
distinction
has
not
yet
been
fully
appreciated
by
many
scientists
for
my
part
i
regard
it
as
the
first
condition
for
forming
any
just
idea
of
the
evolutionary
process
and
i
believe
that
we
must
in
accordance
with
it
divide
embryology
into
two
or
the
science
of
recapitulated
forms
and
cenogenesis
or
the
science
of
supervening
structures
to
give
at
once
a
few
examples
from
the
science
of
origin
in
illustration
of
this
important
distinction
i
may
instance
the
following
processes
in
the
embryology
of
man
and
of
all
the
higher
vertebrates
as
the
formation
of
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
and
of
the
primitive
gut
the
undivided
structure
of
the
dorsal
the
appearance
of
a
simple
axial
rod
between
the
medullary
tube
and
the
gut
the
temporary
formation
of
the
and
arches
the
primitive
kidneys
and
so
on
all
these
and
many
other
important
structures
have
clearly
been
transmitted
by
a
steady
heredity
from
the
early
ancestors
of
the
mammal
and
are
therefore
direct
indications
of
the
presence
of
similar
structures
in
the
history
of
the
stem
on
the
other
hand
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
with
the
following
embryonic
forms
which
we
must
describe
as
cenogenetic
processes
the
formation
of
the
the
allantois
the
placenta
the
amnion
the
serolemma
and
the
generally
speaking
the
various
fœtal
membranes
and
the
corresponding
changes
in
the
blood
vessels
further
instances
are
the
dual
structure
of
the
heart
cavity
the
temporary
division
of
the
plates
of
the
primitive
vertebræ
and
lateral
plates
the
secondary
closing
of
the
ventral
and
intestinal
walls
the
formation
of
the
navel
and
so
on
all
these
and
many
other
phenomena
are
certainly
not
traceable
to
similar
structures
in
any
earlier
and
ancestral
form
but
have
arisen
simply
by
adaptation
to
the
peculiar
conditions
of
embryonic
life
within
the
fœtal
membranes
in
view
of
these
facts
we
may
now
give
the
following
more
precise
expression
to
our
chief
law
of
biogeny
the
evolution
of
the
fœtus
or
is
a
condensed
and
abbreviated
recapitulation
of
the
evolution
of
the
stem
or
and
this
recapitulation
is
the
more
complete
in
proportion
as
the
original
development
or
is
preserved
by
a
constant
heredity
on
the
other
hand
it
becomes
less
complete
in
proportion
as
a
varying
adaptation
to
new
conditions
increases
the
disturbing
factors
in
the
development
or
cenogenesis
all
these
and
the
following
structures
will
be
fully
described
in
later
the
cenogenetic
alterations
or
distortions
of
the
original
palingenetic
course
of
development
take
the
form
as
a
rule
of
a
gradual
displacement
of
the
phenomena
which
is
slowly
effected
by
adaptation
to
the
changed
conditions
of
embryonic
existence
during
the
course
of
thousands
of
years
this
displacement
may
take
place
as
regards
either
the
position
or
the
time
of
a
phenomenon
the
great
importance
and
strict
regularity
of
the
in
embryology
have
been
carefully
studied
recently
by
ernest
mehnert
in
his
jena
he
contends
that
our
biogenetic
law
has
not
been
impaired
by
the
attacks
of
its
opponents
and
goes
on
to
say
any
piece
of
knowledge
has
contributed
so
much
to
the
advance
of
embryology
as
this
its
formulation
is
one
of
the
most
signal
services
to
general
biology
it
was
not
until
this
law
passed
into
the
flesh
and
blood
of
investigators
and
they
had
accustomed
themselves
to
see
a
reminiscence
of
ancestral
history
in
embryonic
structures
that
we
witnessed
the
great
progress
which
embryological
research
has
made
in
the
last
two
the
best
proof
of
the
correctness
of
this
opinion
is
that
now
the
most
fruitful
work
is
done
in
all
branches
of
embryology
with
the
aid
of
this
biogenetic
law
and
that
it
enables
students
to
attain
every
year
thousands
of
brilliant
results
that
they
would
never
have
reached
without
it
it
is
only
when
one
appreciates
the
cenogenetic
processes
in
relation
to
the
palingenetic
and
when
one
takes
careful
account
of
the
changes
which
the
latter
may
suffer
from
the
former
that
the
radical
importance
of
the
biogenetic
law
is
recognised
and
it
is
felt
to
be
the
most
illuminating
principle
in
the
science
of
evolution
in
this
task
of
discrimination
it
is
the
silver
thread
in
relation
to
which
we
can
arrange
all
the
phenomena
of
this
realm
of
thread
which
alone
enables
us
to
find
our
way
through
this
labyrinth
of
forms
hence
the
brothers
sarasin
the
zoologists
could
say
with
perfect
justice
in
their
study
of
the
evolution
of
the
that
great
biogenetic
law
is
just
as
important
for
the
zoologist
in
tracing
processes
as
spectrum
analyses
is
for
the
even
at
an
earlier
period
when
a
correct
acquaintance
with
the
evolution
of
the
human
and
animal
frame
was
only
just
being
that
is
scarcely
eighty
years
ago
greatest
astonishment
was
felt
at
the
remarkable
similarity
observed
between
the
embryonic
forms
or
stages
of
fœtal
development
in
very
different
animals
attention
was
called
even
then
to
their
close
resemblance
to
certain
animal
forms
belonging
to
some
of
the
lower
groups
the
older
scientists
oken
treviranus
and
others
knew
perfectly
well
that
these
lower
forms
in
a
sense
illustrated
and
fixed
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
animal
world
a
temporary
stage
in
the
evolution
of
higher
forms
the
famous
anatomist
meckel
spoke
in
of
a
between
the
development
of
the
embryo
and
the
series
of
baer
raised
the
question
in
how
far
within
the
vertebrate
type
the
embryonic
forms
of
the
higher
animals
assume
the
permanent
shapes
of
members
of
lower
groups
but
it
was
impossible
fully
to
understand
and
appreciate
this
remarkable
resemblance
at
that
time
we
owe
our
capacity
to
do
this
to
the
theory
of
descent
it
is
this
that
puts
in
their
true
light
the
action
of
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
it
explains
to
us
the
vital
importance
of
their
constant
reciprocal
action
in
the
production
of
organic
forms
darwin
was
the
first
to
teach
us
the
great
part
that
was
played
in
this
by
the
ceaseless
struggle
for
existence
between
living
things
and
to
show
how
under
the
influence
of
this
by
natural
selection
new
species
were
produced
and
maintained
solely
by
the
interaction
of
heredity
and
adaptation
it
was
thus
darwinism
that
first
opened
our
eyes
to
a
true
comprehension
of
the
supremely
important
relations
between
the
two
parts
of
the
science
of
organic
and
phylogeny
heredity
and
adaptation
are
in
fact
the
two
constructive
physiological
functions
of
living
things
unless
we
understand
these
properly
we
can
make
no
headway
in
the
study
of
evolution
hence
until
the
time
of
darwin
no
one
had
a
clear
idea
of
the
real
nature
and
causes
of
embryonic
development
it
was
impossible
to
explain
the
curious
series
of
forms
through
which
the
human
embryo
passed
it
was
quite
unintelligible
why
this
strange
succession
of
forms
appeared
in
the
series
at
all
it
had
previously
been
generally
assumed
that
the
man
was
found
complete
in
all
his
parts
in
the
ovum
and
that
the
development
consisted
only
in
an
unfolding
of
the
various
parts
a
simple
process
of
growth
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
on
the
contrary
the
whole
process
of
the
development
of
the
individual
presents
to
the
observer
a
connected
succession
of
different
and
these
forms
display
a
great
variety
of
external
and
internal
structure
but
each
individual
human
being
should
pass
through
this
series
of
forms
in
the
course
of
his
embryonic
development
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
until
lamarck
and
darwin
established
the
theory
of
descent
through
this
theory
we
have
at
last
detected
the
real
causes
the
causes
of
the
individual
development
we
have
learned
that
these
causes
suffice
of
themselves
to
effect
the
formation
of
the
organism
and
that
there
is
no
need
of
the
causes
which
were
formerly
assumed
it
is
true
that
in
the
academic
philosophies
of
our
time
these
final
causes
still
figure
very
prominently
in
the
new
philosophy
of
nature
we
can
entirely
replace
them
by
efficient
causes
we
shall
see
in
the
course
of
our
inquiry
how
the
most
wonderful
and
hitherto
insoluble
enigmas
in
the
human
and
animal
frame
have
proved
amenable
to
a
mechanical
explanation
by
causes
acting
without
prevision
through
reform
of
the
science
of
evolution
we
have
everywhere
been
able
to
substitute
unconscious
causes
acting
from
necessity
for
conscious
purposive
causes
the
monistic
or
mechanical
philosophy
of
nature
holds
that
only
unconscious
necessary
efficient
causes
are
at
work
in
the
whole
field
of
nature
in
organic
life
as
well
as
in
inorganic
changes
on
the
other
hand
the
dualist
or
vitalist
philosophy
of
nature
affirms
that
unconscious
forces
are
only
at
work
in
the
inorganic
world
and
that
we
find
conscious
purposive
or
final
causes
in
organic
nature
if
the
new
science
of
evolution
had
done
no
more
than
this
every
thoughtful
man
would
have
to
admit
that
it
had
accomplished
an
immense
advance
in
knowledge
it
means
that
in
the
whole
of
philosophy
that
tendency
which
we
call
monistic
in
opposition
to
the
dualistic
which
has
hitherto
prevailed
must
be
accepted
at
this
point
the
science
of
human
evolution
has
a
direct
and
profound
bearing
on
the
foundations
of
philosophy
modern
anthropology
has
by
its
astounding
discoveries
during
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
compelled
us
to
take
a
completely
monistic
view
of
life
our
bodily
structure
and
its
life
our
embryonic
development
and
our
evolution
as
a
species
teach
us
that
the
same
laws
of
nature
rule
in
the
life
of
man
as
in
the
rest
of
the
universe
for
this
reason
if
for
no
others
it
is
desirable
nay
indispensable
that
every
man
who
wishes
to
form
a
serious
and
philosophic
view
of
life
and
above
all
the
expert
philosopher
should
acquaint
himself
with
the
chief
facts
of
this
branch
of
science
monism
is
neither
purely
materialistic
nor
purely
spiritualistic
but
a
reconciliation
of
these
two
principles
since
it
regards
the
whole
of
nature
as
one
and
sees
only
efficient
causes
at
work
in
it
dualism
on
the
contrary
holds
that
nature
and
spirit
matter
and
force
the
world
and
god
inorganic
and
organic
nature
are
separate
and
independent
existences
cf
riddle
of
the
universe
chap
xii
the
facts
of
embryology
have
so
great
and
obvious
a
significance
in
this
connection
that
even
in
recent
years
dualist
and
teleological
philosophers
have
tried
to
rid
themselves
of
them
by
simply
denying
them
this
was
done
for
instance
as
regards
the
fact
that
man
is
developed
from
an
egg
and
that
this
egg
or
ovum
is
a
simple
cell
as
in
the
case
of
other
animals
when
i
had
explained
this
pregnant
fact
and
its
significance
in
my
of
creation
it
was
described
in
many
of
the
theological
journals
as
a
dishonest
invention
of
my
own
the
fact
that
the
embryos
of
man
and
the
dog
are
at
a
certain
stage
of
their
development
almost
indistinguishable
was
also
denied
when
we
examine
the
human
embryo
in
the
third
or
fourth
week
of
its
development
we
find
it
to
be
quite
different
in
shape
and
structure
from
the
human
being
but
almost
identical
with
that
of
the
ape
the
dog
the
rabbit
and
other
mammals
at
the
same
stage
of
ontogeny
we
find
a
body
of
very
simple
construction
with
a
tail
below
and
a
pair
of
fins
at
the
sides
something
like
those
of
a
fish
but
very
different
from
the
limbs
of
man
and
the
mammals
nearly
the
whole
front
half
of
the
body
is
taken
up
by
a
shapeless
head
without
face
at
the
sides
of
which
we
find
and
arches
as
in
the
fish
at
this
stage
of
its
development
the
human
embryo
does
not
differ
in
any
essential
detail
from
that
of
the
ape
dog
horse
ox
at
a
corresponding
period
this
important
fact
can
easily
be
verified
at
any
moment
by
a
comparison
of
the
embryos
of
man
the
dog
rabbit
etc
nevertheless
the
theologians
and
dualist
philosophers
pronounced
it
to
be
a
materialistic
invention
even
scientists
to
whom
the
facts
should
be
known
have
sought
to
deny
them
there
could
not
be
a
clearer
proof
of
the
profound
importance
of
these
embryological
facts
in
favour
of
the
monistic
philosophy
than
is
afforded
by
these
efforts
of
its
opponents
to
get
rid
of
them
by
silence
or
denial
the
truth
is
that
these
facts
are
most
inconvenient
for
them
and
are
quite
irreconcilable
with
their
views
we
must
be
all
the
more
pressing
on
our
side
to
put
them
in
their
proper
light
i
fully
agree
with
huxley
when
he
says
in
his
place
in
these
facts
are
ignored
by
several
popular
leaders
they
are
easy
to
prove
and
are
accepted
by
all
scientific
men
on
the
other
hand
their
importance
is
so
great
that
those
who
have
once
mastered
them
will
in
my
opinion
find
few
other
biological
discoveries
to
astonish
we
shall
make
it
our
chief
task
to
study
the
evolution
of
bodily
frame
and
its
various
organs
in
their
external
form
and
internal
structures
but
i
may
observe
at
once
that
this
is
accompanied
step
by
step
with
a
study
of
the
evolution
of
their
functions
these
two
branches
of
inquiry
are
inseparably
united
in
the
whole
of
anthropology
just
as
in
zoology
of
which
the
former
is
only
a
section
or
general
biology
everywhere
the
peculiar
form
of
the
organism
and
its
structures
internal
and
external
is
directly
related
to
the
special
physiological
functions
which
the
organism
or
organ
has
to
execute
this
intimate
connection
of
structure
and
function
or
of
the
instrument
and
the
work
done
by
it
is
seen
in
the
science
of
evolution
and
all
its
parts
hence
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
structures
which
is
our
immediate
concern
is
also
the
history
of
the
development
of
functions
and
this
holds
good
of
the
human
organism
as
of
any
other
at
the
same
time
i
must
admit
that
our
knowledge
of
the
evolution
of
functions
is
very
far
from
being
as
complete
as
our
acquaintance
with
the
evolution
of
structures
one
might
say
in
fact
that
the
whole
science
of
evolution
has
almost
confined
itself
to
the
study
of
structures
the
evolution
of
hardly
exists
even
in
name
that
is
the
fault
of
the
physiologists
who
have
as
yet
concerned
themselves
very
little
about
evolution
it
is
only
in
recent
times
that
physiologists
like
engelmann
preyer
verworn
and
a
few
others
have
attacked
the
evolution
of
functions
it
will
be
the
task
of
some
future
physiologist
to
engage
in
the
study
of
the
evolution
of
functions
with
the
same
zeal
and
success
as
has
been
done
for
the
evolution
of
structures
in
morphogeny
the
science
of
the
genesis
of
forms
let
me
illustrate
the
close
connection
of
the
two
by
a
couple
of
examples
the
heart
in
the
human
embryo
has
at
first
a
very
simple
construction
such
as
we
find
in
permanent
form
among
the
ascidiæ
and
other
low
organisms
with
this
is
associated
a
very
simple
system
of
circulation
of
the
blood
now
when
we
find
that
with
the
heart
there
comes
a
totally
different
and
much
more
intricate
circulation
our
inquiry
into
the
development
of
the
heart
becomes
at
once
not
only
an
anatomical
but
also
a
physiological
study
thus
it
is
clear
that
the
ontogeny
of
the
heart
can
only
be
understood
in
the
light
of
its
phylogeny
or
development
in
the
past
both
as
regards
function
and
structure
the
same
holds
true
of
all
the
other
organs
and
their
functions
for
instance
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
the
alimentary
canal
the
lungs
or
the
sexual
organs
gives
us
at
the
same
time
through
the
exact
comparative
investigation
of
most
important
information
with
regard
to
the
evolution
of
the
functions
of
these
organs
this
significant
connection
is
very
clearly
seen
in
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
this
system
is
in
the
economy
of
the
human
body
the
medium
of
sensation
will
and
even
thought
the
highest
of
the
psychic
functions
in
a
word
of
all
the
various
functions
which
constitute
the
proper
object
of
psychology
modern
anatomy
and
physiology
have
proved
that
these
psychic
functions
are
immediately
dependent
on
the
fine
structure
and
the
composition
of
the
central
nervous
system
or
the
internal
texture
of
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
in
these
we
find
the
elaborate
of
which
the
psychic
or
is
the
physiological
function
it
is
so
intricate
that
most
men
still
look
upon
the
mind
as
something
supernatural
that
can
not
be
explained
on
mechanical
principles
but
embryological
research
into
the
gradual
appearance
and
the
formation
of
this
important
system
of
organs
yields
the
most
astounding
and
significant
results
the
first
sketch
of
a
central
nervous
system
in
the
human
embryo
presents
the
same
very
simple
type
as
in
the
other
vertebrates
a
spinal
tube
is
formed
in
the
external
skin
of
the
back
and
from
this
first
comes
a
simple
spinal
cord
without
brain
such
as
we
find
to
be
the
permanent
psychic
organ
in
the
lowest
type
of
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
not
until
a
later
stage
is
a
brain
formed
at
the
anterior
end
of
this
cord
and
then
it
is
a
brain
of
the
most
rudimentary
kind
such
as
we
find
permanently
among
the
lower
fishes
this
simple
brain
develops
step
by
step
successively
assuming
forms
which
correspond
to
those
of
the
amphibia
the
reptiles
the
and
the
lemurs
only
in
the
last
stage
does
it
reach
the
highly
organised
form
which
distinguishes
the
apes
from
the
other
vertebrates
and
which
attains
its
full
development
in
man
comparative
physiology
discovers
a
precisely
similar
growth
the
function
of
the
brain
the
psychic
activity
rises
step
by
step
with
the
advancing
development
of
its
structure
thus
we
are
enabled
by
this
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
nervous
system
to
understand
at
length
natural
development
of
the
human
and
its
gradual
unfolding
it
is
only
with
the
aid
of
embryology
that
we
can
grasp
how
these
highest
and
most
striking
faculties
of
the
animal
organism
have
been
historically
evolved
in
other
words
a
knowledge
of
the
evolution
of
the
spinal
cord
and
brain
in
the
human
embryo
leads
us
directly
to
a
comprehension
of
the
historic
development
or
phylogeny
of
the
human
mind
that
highest
of
all
faculties
which
we
regard
as
something
so
marvellous
and
supernatural
in
the
adult
man
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
pregnant
results
of
evolutionary
science
happily
our
embryological
knowledge
of
central
nervous
system
is
now
so
adequate
and
agrees
so
thoroughly
with
the
complementary
results
of
comparative
anatomy
and
physiology
that
we
are
thus
enabled
to
obtain
a
clear
insight
into
one
of
the
highest
problems
of
philosophy
the
phylogeny
of
the
soul
or
the
ancestral
history
of
the
mind
of
man
our
chief
support
in
this
comes
from
the
embryological
study
of
it
or
the
ontogeny
of
the
soul
this
important
section
of
psychology
owes
its
origin
especially
to
preyer
in
his
interesting
works
such
as
mind
of
the
child
the
biography
of
a
of
milicent
washburn
shinn
also
deserves
mention
see
also
development
in
the
translation
and
of
and
in
this
way
we
follow
the
only
path
along
which
we
may
hope
to
reach
the
solution
of
this
difficult
problem
years
have
now
elapsed
since
in
my
morphology
i
established
phylogeny
as
an
independent
science
and
showed
its
intimate
causal
connection
with
ontogeny
thirty
years
have
passed
since
i
gave
in
my
the
proof
of
the
justice
of
this
and
completed
it
with
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
when
we
look
back
on
this
period
we
may
ask
what
has
been
accomplished
during
it
by
the
fundamental
law
of
biogeny
if
we
are
impartial
we
must
reply
that
it
has
proved
its
fertility
in
hundreds
of
sound
results
and
that
by
its
aid
we
have
acquired
a
vast
fund
of
knowledge
which
we
should
never
have
obtained
without
it
there
has
been
no
dearth
of
violent
my
conception
of
an
intimate
causal
connection
between
ontogenesis
and
phylogenesis
but
no
other
satisfactory
explanation
of
these
important
phenomena
has
yet
been
offered
to
us
i
say
this
especially
with
regard
to
wilhelm
theory
of
a
evolution
which
questions
the
truth
of
phylogeny
generally
and
would
explain
the
complicated
embryonic
processes
without
going
beyond
by
simple
physical
as
the
bending
and
folding
of
leaves
by
electricity
the
origin
of
cavities
through
unequal
strain
of
the
tissues
the
formation
of
processes
by
uneven
growth
and
so
on
but
the
fact
is
that
these
embryological
phenomena
themselves
demand
explanation
in
turn
and
this
can
only
be
found
as
a
rule
in
the
corresponding
changes
in
the
long
ancestral
series
or
in
the
physiological
functions
of
heredity
and
adaptation
chapter

the
older
embryology
it
is
in
many
ways
useful
on
entering
upon
the
study
of
any
science
to
cast
a
glance
at
its
historical
development
the
saying
that
is
best
understood
in
its
has
a
distinct
application
to
science
while
we
follow
its
gradual
development
we
get
a
clearer
insight
into
its
aims
and
objects
moreover
we
shall
see
that
the
present
condition
of
the
science
of
human
evolution
with
all
its
characteristics
can
only
be
rightly
understood
when
we
examine
its
historical
growth
this
task
will
however
not
detain
us
long
the
study
of
evolution
is
one
of
the
latest
branches
of
natural
science
whether
you
consider
the
embryological
or
the
phylogenetic
section
of
it
apart
from
the
few
germs
of
our
science
which
we
find
in
classical
antiquity
and
which
we
shall
notice
presently
we
may
say
that
it
takes
its
definite
rise
as
a
science
in
the
year
when
one
of
the
greatest
german
scientists
caspar
friedrich
wolff
published
his
that
was
the
of
the
science
of
animal
embryology
it
was
not
until
fifty
years
later
in
that
jean
lamarck
published
his
first
effort
to
provide
a
base
for
the
theory
of
evolution
and
it
was
another
before
work
appeared
in
which
we
may
regard
as
the
first
scientific
attainment
of
this
aim
but
before
we
go
further
into
this
solid
establishment
of
evolution
we
must
cast
a
brief
glance
at
that
famous
philosopher
and
scientist
of
antiquity
who
stood
alone
in
this
as
in
many
other
branches
of
science
for
more
than
years
the
of
natural
history
aristotle
the
extant
scientific
works
of
aristotle
deal
with
many
different
sides
of
biological
research
the
most
comprehensive
of
them
is
his
famous
of
but
not
less
interesting
is
the
smaller
work
on
the
of
animals
peri
zoon
geneseos
this
work
treats
especially
of
embryonic
development
and
it
is
of
great
interest
as
being
the
earliest
of
its
kind
and
the
only
one
that
has
come
down
to
us
in
any
completeness
from
classical
antiquity
aristotle
studied
embryological
questions
in
various
classes
of
animals
and
among
the
lower
groups
he
learned
many
most
remarkable
facts
which
we
only
rediscovered
between
and
it
is
certain
for
instance
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
very
peculiar
mode
of
propagation
of
the
cuttlefishes
or
cephalopods
in
which
a
hangs
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
fœtus
he
knew
also
that
embryos
come
from
the
eggs
of
the
bee
even
when
they
have
not
been
fertilised
this
or
of
the
bees
has
only
been
established
in
our
time
by
the
distinguished
zoologist
of
munich
siebold
he
discovered
that
male
bees
come
from
the
unfertilised
and
female
bees
only
from
the
fertilised
eggs
aristotle
further
states
that
some
kinds
of
fishes
of
the
genus
are
hermaphrodites
each
individual
having
both
male
and
female
organs
and
being
able
to
fertilise
itself
this
also
has
been
recently
confirmed
he
knew
that
the
embryo
of
many
fishes
of
the
shark
family
is
attached
to
the
body
by
a
sort
of
placenta
or
nutritive
organ
very
rich
in
blood
apart
from
these
such
an
arrangement
is
only
found
among
the
higher
mammals
and
man
this
placenta
of
the
shark
was
looked
upon
as
legendary
for
a
long
time
until
johannes
müller
proved
it
to
be
a
fact
in
thus
a
number
of
remarkable
discoveries
were
found
in
embryological
work
proving
a
very
good
acquaintance
of
the
great
helped
by
his
the
facts
of
ontogeny
and
a
great
advance
upon
succeeding
generations
in
this
respect
in
the
case
of
most
of
these
discoveries
he
did
not
merely
describe
the
fact
but
added
a
number
of
observations
on
its
significance
some
of
these
theoretical
remarks
are
of
particular
interest
because
they
show
a
correct
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
the
embryonic
processes
he
conceives
the
development
of
the
individual
as
a
new
formation
in
the
course
of
which
the
various
parts
of
the
body
take
shape
successively
when
the
human
or
animal
frame
is
developed
in
the
body
or
separately
in
an
egg
the
he
regards
as
the
and
centre
of
the
appear
first
once
the
heart
is
formed
the
other
organs
arise
the
internal
ones
before
the
external
the
upper
those
above
the
diaphragm
before
the
lower
or
those
beneath
the
diaphragm
the
brain
is
formed
at
an
early
stage
and
the
eyes
grow
out
of
it
these
observations
are
quite
correct
and
if
we
try
to
form
some
idea
from
these
data
of
general
conception
of
the
embryonic
process
we
find
a
dim
prevision
of
the
theory
which
wolff
showed
years
afterwards
to
be
the
correct
view
it
is
significant
for
instance
that
aristotle
denied
the
eternity
of
the
individual
in
any
respect
he
said
that
the
species
or
genus
the
group
of
similar
individuals
might
be
eternal
but
the
individual
itself
is
temporary
it
comes
into
being
in
the
act
of
procreation
and
passes
away
at
death
during
the
years
after
aristotle
no
progress
whatever
was
made
in
general
zoology
or
in
embryology
in
particular
people
were
content
to
read
copy
translate
and
comment
on
aristotle
scarcely
a
single
independent
effort
at
research
was
made
in
the
whole
of
the
period
during
the
middle
ages
the
spread
of
strong
religious
beliefs
put
formidable
obstacles
in
the
way
of
independent
scientific
investigation
there
was
no
question
of
resuming
the
advance
of
biology
even
when
human
anatomy
began
to
stir
itself
once
more
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
independent
research
was
resumed
into
the
structure
of
the
developed
body
anatomists
did
not
dare
to
extend
their
inquiries
to
the
unformed
body
the
embryo
and
its
development
there
were
many
reasons
for
the
prevailing
horror
of
such
studies
it
is
natural
enough
when
we
remember
that
a
bull
of
boniface
viii
excommunicated
every
man
who
ventured
to
dissect
a
human
corpse
if
the
dissection
of
a
developed
body
were
a
crime
to
be
thus
punished
how
much
more
dreadful
must
it
have
seemed
to
deal
with
the
embryonic
body
still
enclosed
in
the
womb
which
the
creator
himself
had
decently
veiled
from
the
curiosity
of
the
scientist
the
christian
church
then
putting
many
thousands
to
death
for
unbelief
had
a
shrewd
presentiment
of
the
menace
that
science
contained
against
its
authority
it
was
powerful
enough
to
see
that
its
rival
did
not
grow
too
quickly
it
was
not
until
the
reformation
broke
the
power
of
the
church
and
a
refreshing
breath
of
the
spirit
dissolved
the
icy
chains
that
bound
science
that
anatomy
and
embryology
and
all
the
other
branches
of
research
could
begin
to
advance
once
more
however
embryology
lagged
far
behind
anatomy
the
first
works
on
embryology
appear
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
italian
anatomist
fabricius
ab
aquapendente
a
professor
at
padua
opened
the
advance
in
his
two
books
formato
fœtu
and
formatione
fœtus
he
published
the
older
illustrations
and
descriptions
of
the
embryos
of
man
and
other
mammals
and
of
the
hen
similar
imperfect
illustrations
were
given
by
spigelius
formato
fœtu
and
by
needham
and
his
more
famous
compatriot
harvey
who
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
the
animal
body
and
formulated
the
important
principle
vivum
ex
all
life
comes
from
life
the
dutch
scientist
swammerdam
published
in
his
of
the
earliest
observations
on
the
embryology
of
the
frog
and
the
division
of
its
but
the
most
important
embryological
studies
in
the
sixteenth
century
were
those
of
the
famous
italian
marcello
malpighi
of
bologna
who
led
the
way
both
in
zoology
and
botany
his
treatises
formatione
and
ovo
contain
the
first
consistent
description
of
the
development
of
the
chick
in
the
fertilised
egg
here
i
ought
to
say
a
word
about
the
important
part
played
by
the
chick
in
the
growth
of
our
science
the
development
of
the
chick
like
that
of
the
young
of
all
other
birds
agrees
in
all
its
main
features
with
that
of
the
other
chief
vertebrates
and
even
of
man
the
three
highest
classes
of
birds
and
reptiles
lizards
serpents
tortoises
etc
from
the
beginning
of
their
embryonic
development
so
striking
a
resemblance
in
all
the
chief
points
of
structure
and
especially
in
their
first
forms
that
for
a
long
time
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
them
we
have
known
now
for
some
time
that
we
need
only
examine
the
embryo
of
a
bird
which
is
the
easiest
to
get
at
in
order
to
learn
the
typical
mode
of
development
of
a
mammal
and
therefore
of
man
as
soon
as
scientists
began
to
study
the
human
embryo
or
the
generally
in
its
earlier
stages
about
the
middle
and
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
important
fact
was
very
quickly
discovered
it
is
both
theoretically
and
practically
of
great
value
as
regards
the
of
evolution
we
can
draw
the
most
weighty
inferences
from
this
similarity
between
the
embryos
of
widely
different
classes
of
animals
but
for
the
practical
purposes
of
embryological
research
the
discovery
is
invaluable
because
we
can
fill
up
the
gaps
in
our
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
embryology
of
the
mammals
from
the
more
thoroughly
studied
embryology
of
the
bird
eggs
are
easily
to
be
had
in
any
quantity
and
the
development
of
the
chick
may
be
followed
step
by
step
in
artificial
incubation
the
development
of
the
mammal
is
much
more
difficult
to
follow
because
here
the
embryo
is
not
detached
and
enclosed
in
a
large
egg
but
the
tiny
ovum
remains
in
the
womb
until
the
growth
is
completed
hence
it
is
very
difficult
to
keep
up
sustained
observation
of
the
various
stages
in
any
great
extent
quite
apart
from
such
extrinsic
considerations
as
the
cost
the
technical
difficulties
and
many
other
obstacles
which
we
encounter
when
we
would
make
an
extensive
study
of
the
fertilised
mammal
the
chicken
has
therefore
always
been
the
chief
object
of
study
in
this
connection
the
excellent
incubators
we
now
have
enable
us
to
observe
it
in
any
quantity
and
at
any
stage
of
development
and
so
follow
the
whole
course
of
its
formation
step
by
step
by
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
malpighi
had
advanced
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
do
with
the
imperfect
microscope
of
his
time
in
the
embryological
study
of
the
chick
further
progress
was
arrested
until
the
instrument
and
the
technical
methods
should
be
improved
the
vertebrate
embryos
are
so
small
and
delicate
in
their
earlier
stages
that
you
can
not
go
very
far
into
the
study
of
them
without
a
good
microscope
and
other
technical
aid
but
this
substantial
improvement
of
the
microscope
and
the
other
apparatus
did
not
take
place
until
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
embryology
made
scarcely
any
advance
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
systematic
natural
history
of
plants
and
animals
received
so
great
an
impulse
through
the
publication
of
famous
not
until
did
the
genius
arise
who
was
to
give
it
an
entirely
new
character
caspar
friedrich
wolff
until
then
embryology
had
been
occupied
almost
exclusively
in
unfortunate
and
misleading
efforts
to
build
up
theories
on
the
imperfect
empirical
material
then
available
the
theory
which
then
prevailed
and
remained
in
favour
throughout
nearly
the
whole
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
commonly
called
at
that
time
evolution
it
is
better
to
describe
it
as
preformation
its
chief
point
is
this
there
is
no
new
formation
of
structures
in
the
embryonic
development
of
any
organism
animal
or
plant
or
even
of
man
there
is
only
a
growth
or
unfolding
of
parts
which
have
been
constructed
or
from
all
eternity
though
on
a
very
small
scale
and
closely
packed
together
hence
every
living
germ
contains
all
the
organs
and
parts
of
the
body
in
the
form
and
arrangement
they
will
present
later
already
within
it
and
thus
the
whole
embryological
process
is
merely
an
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
or
an
of
parts
that
were
and
folded
up
in
it
so
for
instance
we
find
in
the
egg
not
merely
a
simple
cell
that
divides
and
subdivides
and
forms
germinal
layers
and
at
last
after
all
kinds
of
variation
and
cleavage
and
reconstruction
brings
forth
the
body
of
the
chick
but
there
is
in
every
egg
from
the
first
a
complete
chicken
with
all
its
parts
made
and
neatly
packed
these
parts
are
so
small
or
so
transparent
that
the
microscope
can
not
detect
them
in
the
hatching
these
parts
merely
grow
larger
and
spread
out
in
the
normal
way
this
theory
is
usually
known
as
the
in
germany
in
contradistinction
to
the
but
as
it
is
the
latter
that
is
called
the
in
england
france
and
italy
and
and
are
taken
to
be
synonymous
it
seems
better
to
call
the
first
the
when
this
theory
is
consistently
developed
it
becomes
a
according
to
its
teaching
there
was
made
in
the
beginning
one
couple
or
one
individual
of
each
species
of
animal
or
plant
but
this
one
individual
contained
the
germs
of
all
the
other
individuals
of
the
same
species
who
should
ever
come
to
life
as
the
age
of
the
earth
was
generally
believed
at
that
time
to
be
fixed
by
the
bible
at
or
years
it
seemed
possible
to
calculate
how
many
individuals
of
each
species
had
lived
in
the
period
and
so
had
been
packed
inside
the
first
being
that
was
created
the
theory
was
consistently
extended
to
man
and
it
was
affirmed
that
our
common
parent
eve
had
had
stored
in
her
ovary
the
germs
of
all
the
children
of
men
would
be
the
literal
translation
scatula
is
the
latin
for
a
case
or
the
theory
at
first
took
the
form
of
a
belief
that
it
was
the
who
were
thus
encased
in
the
first
being
one
couple
of
each
species
was
created
but
the
female
contained
in
her
ovary
all
the
future
individuals
of
the
species
of
either
sex
however
this
had
to
be
altered
when
the
dutch
microscopist
leeuwenhoek
discovered
the
male
spermatozoa
in
and
showed
that
an
immense
number
of
these
extremely
fine
and
mobile
beings
exist
in
the
male
sperm
this
will
be
explained
in
chapter
vii
this
astonishing
discovery
was
further
advanced
when
it
was
proved
that
these
living
bodies
swimming
about
in
the
seminal
fluid
were
real
animalcules
and
in
fact
were
the
germs
of
the
future
generation
when
the
male
and
female
procreative
elements
came
together
at
conception
these
spermatozoa
were
supposed
to
penetrate
into
the
fertile
body
of
the
ovum
and
begin
to
develop
there
as
the
plant
seed
does
in
the
fruitful
earth
hence
every
spermatozoon
was
regarded
as
a
a
tiny
complete
man
all
the
parts
were
believed
to
be
in
it
and
merely
grew
larger
when
it
reached
its
proper
medium
in
the
female
ovum
this
theory
also
was
consistently
developed
in
the
sense
that
in
each
of
these
bodies
the
whole
of
its
posterity
was
supposed
to
be
present
in
the
minutest
form
sexual
glands
were
thought
to
have
contained
the
germs
of
the
whole
of
humanity
this
of
male
found
itself
at
once
in
keen
opposition
to
the
prevailing
theory
the
two
rival
theories
at
once
opened
a
very
lively
campaign
and
the
physiologists
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
divided
into
two
great
animalculists
and
the
fought
vigorously
the
animalculists
held
that
the
spermatozoa
were
the
true
germs
and
appealed
to
the
lively
movements
and
the
structure
of
these
bodies
the
opposing
party
of
the
ovulists
who
clung
to
the
older
theory
affirmed
that
the
ovum
is
the
real
germ
and
that
the
spermatozoa
merely
stimulate
it
at
conception
to
begin
its
growth
all
the
future
generations
are
stored
in
the
ovum
this
view
was
held
by
the
great
majority
of
the
biologists
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
wolff
proved
it
in
to
be
without
foundation
it
owed
its
prestige
chiefly
to
the
circumstance
that
the
most
weighty
authorities
in
the
biology
and
philosophy
of
the
day
decided
in
favour
of
it
especially
haller
bonnet
and
leibnitz
albrecht
haller
professor
at
göttingen
who
is
often
called
the
father
of
physiology
was
a
man
of
wide
and
varied
learning
but
he
does
not
occupy
a
very
high
position
in
regard
to
insight
into
natural
phenomena
he
made
a
vigorous
defence
of
the
in
his
famous
work
physiologiae
affirming
is
no
such
thing
as
formation
est
no
part
of
the
animal
frame
is
made
before
another
all
were
made
he
thus
denied
that
there
was
any
evolution
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
beard
existed
in
the
child
and
the
antlers
in
the
hornless
fawn
all
the
parts
were
there
in
advance
and
were
merely
hidden
from
the
eye
of
man
for
the
time
being
haller
even
calculated
the
number
of
human
beings
that
god
must
have
created
on
the
sixth
day
and
stored
away
in

he
put
the
number
at
millions
assuming
the
age
of
the
world
to
be
years
the
average
age
of
a
human
being
to
be
thirty
years
and
the
population
of
the
world
at
that
time
to
be
millions
and
the
famous
haller
maintained
all
this
nonsense
in
spite
of
its
ridiculous
consequences
even
after
wolff
had
discovered
the
real
course
of
embryonic
development
and
established
it
by
direct
observation
among
the
philosophers
of
the
time
the
distinguished
leibnitz
was
the
chief
defender
of
the
theory
and
by
his
authority
and
literary
prestige
won
many
adherents
to
it
supported
by
his
system
of
monads
according
to
which
body
and
soul
are
united
in
inseparable
association
and
by
their
union
form
the
individual
or
the
leibnitz
consistently
extended
the
to
the
soul
and
held
that
this
was
no
more
evolved
than
the
body
he
says
for
instance
in
his
mean
that
these
souls
which
one
day
are
to
be
the
souls
of
men
are
present
in
the
seed
like
those
of
other
species
in
such
wise
that
they
existed
in
our
ancestors
as
far
back
as
adam
or
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
in
the
forms
of
organised
the
theory
seemed
to
receive
considerable
support
from
the
observations
of
one
of
its
most
zealous
supporters

discovered
in

a
case
of
parthenogenesis

an

has
lately
been
found
by
siebold

others
among
various
classes
of
the

crustacea

insects
among
these
and
other
animals
of
certain
lower

reproduce
for
several
generations
without
having
been
fertilised
by

not

are
called

bonnet
saw
that
a
female
which
he
had
kept
in
cloistral
isolation
and
rigidly
removed
from
contact
with
males
had
on
the
eleventh
day
after
forming
a
new
skin
for
the
fourth
time
a
living
daughter
and
during
the
next
twenty
days
other
daughters
and
that
all
of
them
went
on
to
reproduce
in
the
same
way
without
any
contact
with
males
it
seemed
as
if
this
furnished
an
irrefutable
proof
of
the
truth
of
the
scatulation
theory
as
it
was
held
by
the
ovulists
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
the
theory
then
secured
general
acceptance
this
was
the
condition
of
things
when
suddenly
in
caspar
friedrich
wolff
appeared
and
dealt
a
fatal
blow
at
the
whole
preformation
theory
with
his
new
theory
of
epigenesis
wolff
the
son
of
a
berlin
tailor
was
born
in
and
went
through
his
scientific
and
medical
studies
first
at
berlin
under
the
famous
anatomist
meckel
and
afterwards
at
halle
here
he
secured
his
doctorate
in
his
year
and
in
his
academic
dissertation
november
the
generationis
expounded
the
new
theory
of
a
real
development
on
a
basis
of
epigenesis
this
treatise
is
in
spite
of
its
smallness
and
its
obscure
phraseology
one
of
the
most
valuable
in
the
whole
range
of
biological
literature
it
is
equally
distinguished
for
the
mass
of
new
and
careful
observations
it
contains
and
the
and
pregnant
ideas
which
the
author
everywhere
extracts
from
his
observations
and
builds
into
a
luminous
and
accurate
theory
of
generation
nevertheless
it
met
with
no
success
at
the
time
although
scientific
studies
were
then
assiduously
cultivated
owing
to
the
impulse
given
by
botanists
and
zoologists
were
no
longer
counted
by
dozens
but
by
hundreds
hardly
any
notice
was
taken
of
theory
even
when
he
established
the
truth
of
epigenesis
by
the
most
rigorous
observations
and
demolished
the
airy
structure
of
the
preformation
theory
the
scientist
haller
proved
one
of
the
most
strenuous
supporters
of
the
old
theory
and
rejected
correct
view
with
a
dictatorial
is
no
such
thing
as
he
even
went
on
to
say
that
religion
was
menaced
by
the
new
theory
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
whole
of
the
physiologists
of
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
submitted
to
the
ruling
of
this
physiological
pontiff
and
attacked
the
theory
of
epigenesis
as
a
dangerous
innovation
it
was
not
until
more
than
fifty
years
afterwards
that
work
was
appreciated
only
when
meckel
translated
into
german
in
another
valuable
work
of
on
formation
of
the
alimentary
written
in
and
called
attention
to
its
great
importance
did
people
begin
to
think
of
him
once
more
yet
this
obscure
writer
had
evinced
a
profounder
insight
into
the
nature
of
the
living
organism
than
any
other
scientist
of
the
eighteenth
century
idea
led
to
an
appreciable
advance
over
the
whole
field
of
biology
there
is
such
a
vast
number
of
new
and
important
observations
and
pregnant
thoughts
in
his
writings
that
we
have
only
gradually
learned
to
appreciate
them
rightly
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
opened
up
the
true
path
for
research
in
many
directions
in
the
first
place
his
theory
of
epigenesis
gave
us
our
first
real
insight
into
the
nature
of
embryonic
development
he
showed
convincingly
that
the
development
of
every
organism
consists
of
a
series
of
formations
and
that
there
is
no
trace
whatever
of
the
complete
form
either
in
the
ovum
or
the
spermatozoon
on
the
contrary
these
are
quite
simple
bodies
with
a
very
different
purport
the
embryo
which
is
developed
from
them
is
also
quite
different
in
its
internal
arrangement
and
outer
configuration
from
the
complete
organism
there
is
no
trace
whatever
of
preformation
or
of
organs
we
can
scarcely
call
epigenesis
a
because
we
are
convinced
it
is
a
fact
and
can
demonstrate
it
at
any
moment
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
wolff
furnished
the
conclusive
empirical
proof
of
his
theory
in
his
classic
dissertation
on
formation
of
the
alimentary
in
its
complete
state
the
alimentary
canal
of
the
hen
is
a
long
and
complex
tube
with
which
the
lungs
liver
salivary
glands
and
many
other
small
glands
are
connected
wolff
showed
that
in
the
early
stages
of
the
embryonic
chick
there
is
no
trace
whatever
of
this
complicated
tube
with
all
its
dependencies
but
instead
of
it
only
a
flat
body
that
in
fact
the
whole
embryo
has
at
first
the
appearance
of
a
flat
leaf
when
we
remember
how
difficult
the
exact
observation
of
so
fine
and
delicate
a
structure
as
the
early
body
of
the
chick
must
have
been
with
the
poor
microscopes
then
in
use
we
must
admire
the
rare
faculty
for
observation
which
enabled
wolff
to
make
the
most
important
discoveries
in
this
most
difficult
part
of
embryology
by
this
laborious
research
he
reached
the
correct
opinion
that
the
embryonic
body
of
all
the
higher
animals
such
as
the
birds
is
for
some
time
merely
a
flat
thin
at
first
of
one
layer
but
afterwards
of
several
the
lowest
of
these
layers
is
the
alimentary
canal
and
wolff
followed
its
development
from
its
commencement
to
its
completion
he
showed
how
this
structure
first
turns
into
a
groove
then
the
margins
of
this
groove
fold
together
and
form
a
closed
canal
and
at
length
the
two
external
openings
of
the
tube
the
mouth
and
anus
appear
moreover
the
important
fact
that
the
other
systems
of
organs
are
developed
in
the
same
way
from
tubes
formed
out
of
simple
layers
did
not
escape
wolff
the
nerveless
system
muscular
system
and
vascular
system
with
all
the
organs
appertaining
thereto
are
like
the
alimentary
system
developed
out
of
simple
structures
hence
wolff
came
to
the
view
by
which
pander
developed
in
the
of
germinal
fifty
years
afterwards
his
principles
are
not
literally
correct
but
he
comes
as
near
to
the
truth
in
them
as
was
possible
at
that
time
and
could
be
expected
of
him
our
admiration
of
this
gifted
genius
increases
when
we
find
that
he
was
also
the
precursor
of
goethe
in
regard
to
the
metamorphosis
of
plants
and
of
the
famous
cellular
theory
wolff
had
as
huxley
showed
a
clear
presentiment
of
this
cardinal
theory
since
he
recognised
small
microscopic
globules
as
the
elementary
parts
out
of
which
the
germinal
layers
arose
finally
i
must
invite
special
attention
to
the
character
of
the
profound
philosophic
reflections
which
wolff
always
added
to
his
remarkable
observations
he
was
a
great
monistic
philosopher
in
the
best
meaning
of
the
word
it
is
unfortunate
that
his
philosophic
discoveries
were
ignored
as
completely
as
his
observations
for
more
than
half
a
century
we
must
be
all
the
more
careful
to
emphasise
the
fact
of
their
clear
monistic
tendency
chapter
iii
modern
embryology
we
may
distinguish
three
chief
periods
in
the
growth
of
our
science
of
human
embryology
the
first
has
been
considered
in
the
preceding
chapter
it
embraces
the
whole
of
the
preparatory
period
of
research
and
extends
from
aristotle
to
caspar
friedrich
wolff
or
to
the
year
in
which
the
was
published
the
second
period
with
which
we
have
now
to
deal
lasts
about
a
is
to
say
until
the
appearance
of
of
species
which
brought
about
a
change
in
the
very
foundations
of
biology
and
in
particular
of
embryology
the
third
period
begins
with
darwin
when
we
say
that
the
second
period
lasted
a
full
century
we
must
remember
that
work
had
remained
almost
unnoticed
during
half
the
until
the
year
during
the
whole
of
these
years
not
a
single
book
that
appeared
followed
up
the
path
that
wolff
had
opened
or
extended
his
theory
of
embryonic
development
we
merely
find
his
correct
views
based
on
extensive
observations
of
here
and
there
as
erroneous
their
opponents
who
adhered
to
the
dominant
theory
of
preformation
did
not
even
deign
to
reply
to
them
this
unjust
treatment
was
chiefly
due
to
the
extraordinary
authority
of
albrecht
von
haller
it
is
one
of
the
most
astonishing
instances
of
a
great
authority
as
such
preventing
for
a
long
time
the
recognition
of
established
facts
the
general
ignorance
of
work
was
so
great
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
two
scientists
of
jena
oken
and
kieser
began
independent
research
into
the
development
of
the
alimentary
canal
of
the
chick
and
hit
upon
the
right
clue
to
the
embryonic
puzzle
without
knowing
a
word
about
important
treatise
on
the
same
subject
they
were
treading
in
his
very
footsteps
without
suspecting
it
this
can
be
easily
proved
from
the
fact
that
they
did
not
travel
as
far
as
wolff
it
was
not
until
meckel
translated
into
german
book
on
the
alimentary
system
and
pointed
out
its
great
importance
that
the
eyes
of
anatomists
and
physiologists
were
suddenly
opened
at
once
a
number
of
biologists
instituted
fresh
embryological
inquiries
and
began
to
confirm
theory
of
epigenesis
this
resuscitation
of
embryology
and
development
of
the
was
chiefly
connected
with
the
university
of
würtzburg
one
of
the
professors
there
at
that
time
was
döllinger
an
eminent
biologist
and
father
of
the
famous
catholic
historian
who
later
distinguished
himself
by
his
opposition
to
the
new
dogma
of
papal
infallibility
döllinger
was
both
a
profound
thinker
and
an
accurate
observer
he
took
the
keenest
interest
in
embryology
and
worked
at
it
a
good
deal
however
he
is
not
himself
responsible
for
any
important
result
in
this
field
in
a
young
medical
doctor
whom
we
may
at
once
designate
as
chief
successor
karl
ernst
von
baer
came
to
würtzburg
conversations
with
döllinger
on
embryology
led
to
a
fresh
series
of
most
extensive
investigations
döllinger
had
expressed
a
wish
that
some
young
scientist
should
begin
again
under
his
guidance
an
independent
inquiry
into
the
development
of
the
chick
during
the
hatching
of
the
egg
as
neither
he
nor
baer
had
money
enough
to
pay
for
an
incubator
and
the
proper
control
of
the
experiments
and
for
a
competent
artist
to
illustrate
the
various
stages
observed
the
lead
of
the
enterprise
was
given
to
christian
pander
a
wealthy
friend
of
who
had
been
induced
by
baer
to
come
to
würtzburg
an
able
engraver
dalton
was
engaged
to
do
the
in
a
short
time
the
embryology
of
the
chick
in
which
baer
was
taking
the
greatest
indirect
interest
was
so
far
advanced
that
pander
was
able
to
sketch
the
main
features
of
it
on
the
ground
of
theory
in
the
dissertation
he
published
in
he
clearly
enunciated
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
which
wolff
had
anticipated
and
established
the
truth

of
a

had
shown
the

the
nineteenth
century
and
exercised
considerable
influence
on
other
branches
of
biology
as
well
he
built
up
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
so
clearly
and
solidly
that
it
has
been
the
of
embryological
research
ever
since
he
taught
that
in
all
the
vertebrates
first
two
and
then
four
of
these
germinal
layers
are
formed
and
that
the
earliest
rudimentary
organs
of
the
body
arise
by
the
conversion
of
these
layers
into
tubes
he
described
the
first
appearance
of
the
vertebrate
embryo
as
it
may
be
seen
in
the
globular
yelk
of
the
fertilised
egg
as
an
oval
disk
which
first
divides
into
two
layers
from
the
upper
or
layer
are
developed
all
the
organs
which
accomplish
the
phenomena
of
animal
functions
of
sensation
and
motion
and
the
covering
of
the
body
from
the
lower
or
layer
come
the
organs
which
effect
the
vegetative
life
of
the
digestion
respiration
secretion
reproduction
etc
each
of
these
original
layers
divides
according
to
baer
into
two
thinner
and
superimposed
layers
or
plates
he
calls
the
two
plates
of
the
animal
layer
the
and
from
the
upper
of
these
plates
the
the
external
skin
or
outer
covering
of
the
body
the
central
nervous
system
and
the
are
formed
from
the
lower
or
the
muscles
or
fleshy
parts
and
the
bony
a
word
the
motor
evolved
in
the
same
way
baer
said
the
lower
or
vegetative
layer
splits
into
two
plates
which
he
calls
the
and
the
from
the
outer
of
the
two
the
the
heart
spleen
and
the
other
vascular
glands
the
kidneys
and
sexual
glands
are
formed
from
the
fourth
or
layer
in
fine
we
get
the
internal
and
digestive
lining
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
all
its
dependencies
the
liver
lungs
salivary
glands
etc
baer
had
in
the
main
correctly
judged
the
significance
of
these
four
secondary
embryonic
layers
and
he
followed
the
conversion
of
them
into
the
primitive
organs
with
great
perspicacity
he
first
solved
the
difficult
problem
of
the
transformation
of
this
flat
embryonic
disk
into
the
complete
vertebrate
body
through
the
conversion
of
the
layers
or
plates
into
tubes
the
flat
leaves
bend
themselves
in
obedience
to
certain
laws
of
growth
the
borders
of
the
curling
plates
approach
nearer
and
nearer
until
at
last
they
come
into
actual
contact
thus
out
of
the
flat
is
formed
a
hollow
out
of
the
flat
spinal
plate
a
hollow
from
the
a
and
so
on
among
the
many
great
services
which
baer
rendered
to
embryology
especially
vertebrate
embryology
we
must
not
forget
his
discovery
of
the
human
ovum
earlier
scientists
had
as
a
rule
of
course
assumed
that
man
developed
out
of
an
egg
like
the
other
animals
in
fact
the
preformation
theory
held
that
the
germs
of
the
whole
of
humanity
were
stored
already
in
ova
but
the
real
ovum
escaped
detection
until
the
year
this
ovum
is
extremely
small
being
a
tiny
round
vesicle
about
the
of
an
inch
in
diameter
it
can
be
seen
under
very
favourable
circumstances
with
the
naked
eye
as
a
tiny
particle
but
is
otherwise
quite
invisible
this
particle
is
formed
in
the
ovary
inside
a
much
larger
globule
which
takes
the
name
of
the
graafian
follicle
from
its
discoverer
graaf
and
had
previously
been
regarded
as
the
true
ovum
however
in
baer
proved
that
it
was
not
the
real
ovum
which
is
much
smaller
and
is
contained
within
the
follicle
compare
the
end
of
chapter
xxix
baer
was
also
the
first
to
observe
what
is
known
as
the
of
the
vertebrate
that
is
to
say
the
round
vesicle
which
first
develops
out
of
the
impregnated
ovum
and
the
thin
wall
of
which
is
made
up
of
a
single
layer
of
regular
polygonal
cells
see
the
illustration
in
chapter
xii
another
discovery
of
his
that
was
of
great
importance
in
constructing
the
vertebrate
stem
and
the
characteristic
organisation
of
this
extensive
group
to
which
man
belongs
was
the
detection
of
the
axial
rod
or
the
there
is
a
long
round
cylindrical
rod
of
cartilage
which
runs
down
the
longer
axis
of
the
vertebrate
embryo
it
appears
at
an
early
stage
and
is
the
first
sketch
of
the
spinal
column
the
solid
skeletal
axis
of
the
vertebrate
in
the
lowest
of
the
vertebrates
the
amphioxus
the
internal
skeleton
consists
only
of
this
cord
throughout
life
but
even
in
the
case
of
man
and
all
the
higher
vertebrates
it
is
round
this
cord
that
the
spinal
column
and
the
brain
are
afterwards
formed
however
important
as
these
and
many
other
discoveries
of
were
in
vertebrate
embryology
his
researches
were
even
more
influential
from
the
circumstance
that
he
was
the
first
to
employ
the
method
in
studying
the
development
of
the
animal
frame
baer
occupied
himself
chiefly
with
the
embryology
of
vertebrates
especially
the
birds
and
fishes
but
he
by
no
means
confined
his
attention
to
these
gradually
taking
the
various
groups
of
the
invertebrates
into
his
sphere
of
study
as
the
general
result
of
his
comparative
embryological
research
baer
distinguished
four
different
modes
of
development
and
four
corresponding
groups
in
the
animal
world
these
chief
groups
or
types
are
the
vertebrata
the
articulata
the
mollusca
and
all
the
lower
groups
which
were
then
wrongly
comprehended
under
the
general
name
of
the
radiata
georges
cuvier
had
been
the
first
to
formulate
this
distinction
in
he
showed
that
these
groups
present
specific
differences
in
their
whole
internal
structure
and
the
connection
and
disposal
of
their
systems
of
organs
and
that
on
the
other
hand
all
the
animals
of
the
same
the
agreed
in
their
inner
structure
in
spite
of
the
greatest
superficial
differences
but
baer
proved
that
these
four
groups
are
also
quite
differently
developed
from
the
ovum
and
that
the
series
of
embryonic
forms
is
the
same
throughout
for
animals
of
the
same
type
but
different
in
the
case
of
other
animals
up
to
that
time
the
chief
aim
in
the
classification
of
the
animal
kingdom
was
to
arrange
all
the
animals
from
lowest
to
highest
from
the
infusorium
to
man
in
one
long
and
continuous
series
the
erroneous
idea
prevailed
nearly
everywhere
that
there
was
one
uninterrupted
chain
of
evolution
from
the
lowest
animal
to
the
highest
cuvier
and
baer
proved
that
this
view
was
false
and
that
we
must
distinguish
four
totally
different
types
of
animals
on
the
ground
of
anatomic
structure
and
embryonic
development
works
aroused
an
extraordinary
and
widespread
interest
in
embryological
research
immediately
afterwards
we
find
a
great
number
of
observers
at
work
in
the
newly
opened
field
enlarging
it
in
a
very
short
time
with
great
energy
by
their
various
discoveries
in
detail
next
to
comes
the
admirable
work
of
heinrich
rathke
of
königsberg
died
he
made
an
extensive
study
of
the
embryology
not
only
of
the
invertebrates
crustaceans
insects
molluscs
but
also
and
particularly
of
the
vertebrates
fishes
tortoises
serpents
crocodiles
we
owe
the
first
comprehensive
studies
of
mammal
embryology
to
the
careful
research
of
wilhelm
bischoff
of
munich
his
embryology
of
the
rabbit
the
dog
the
and
the
doe
still
form
classical
studies
about
the
same
time
a
great
impetus
was
given
to
the
embryology
of
the
invertebrates
the
way
was
opened
through
this
obscure
province
by
the
studies
of
the
famous
berlin
zoologist
johannes
müller
on
the
echinoderms
he
was
followed
by
albert
kölliker
of
würtzburg
writing
on
the
cuttlefish
or
the
cephalopods
siebold
and
huxley
on
worms
and
zoophytes
fritz
muller
desterro
on
the
crustacea
weismann
on
insects
and
so
on
the
number
of
workers
in
this
field
has
greatly
increased
of
late
and
a
quantity
of
new
and
astonishing
discoveries
have
been
made
one
notices
in
several
of
these
recent
works
on
embryology
that
their
authors
are
too
little
acquainted
with
comparative
anatomy
and
classification
paleontology
is
unfortunately
altogether
neglected
by
many
of
these
new
workers
although
this
interesting
science
furnishes
most
important
facts
for
phylogeny
and
thus
often
proves
of
very
great
service
in
ontogeny
a
very
important
advance
was
made
in
our
science
in
when
the
cellular
theory
was
established
and
a
new
field
of
inquiry
bearing
on
embryology
was
suddenly
opened
when
the
famous
botanist
schleiden
of
jena
showed
in
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
that
every
plant
was
made
up
of
innumerable
elementary
parts
which
we
call
a
pupil
of
johannes
müller
at
berlin
theodor
schwann
applied
the
discovery
at
once
to
the
animal
organism
he
showed
that
in
the
animal
body
as
well
when
we
examine
its
tissues
in
the
microscope
we
find
these
cells
everywhere
to
be
the
elementary
units
all
the
different
tissues
of
the
organism
especially
the
very
dissimilar
tissues
of
the
nerves
muscles
bones
external
skin
mucous
lining
are
originally
formed
out
of
cells
and
this
is
also
true
of
all
the
tissues
of
the
plant
these
cells
are
separate
living
beings
they
are
the
citizens
of
the
state
which
the
entire
multicellular
organism
seems
to
be
this
important
discovery
was
bound
to
be
of
service
to
embryology
as
it
raised
a
number
of
new
questions
what
is
the
relation
of
the
cells
to
the
germinal
layers
are
the
germinal
layers
composed
of
cells
and
what
is
their
relation
to
the
cells
of
the
tissues
that
form
later
how
does
the
ovum
stand
in
the
cellular
theory
is
the
ovum
itself
a
cell
or
is
it
composed
of
cells
these
important
questions
were
now
imposed
on
the
embryologist
by
the
cellular
theory
the
most
notable
effort
to
answer
these
were
attacked
on
all
sides
by
different
contained
in
the
famous
work
into
the
development
of
the
not
translated
of
robert
remak
of
berlin
this
gifted
scientist
succeeded
in
mastering
by
a
complete
reform
of
the
science
the
great
difficulties
which
the
cellular
theory
had
at
first
put
in
the
way
of
embryology
a
berlin
anatomist
carl
boguslaus
reichert
had
already
attempted
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
tissues
but
this
attempt
was
bound
to
miscarry
since
its
not
very
author
lacked
a
sound
acquaintance
with
embryology
and
the
cell
theory
and
even
with
the
structure
and
development
of
the
tissue
in
particular
remak
at
length
brought
order
into
the
dreadful
confusion
that
reichert
had
caused
he
gave
a
perfectly
simple
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
tissues
in
his
opinion
the
animal
ovum
is
always
simple
the
germinal
layers
which
develop
out
of
it
are
always
composed
of
cells
and
these
cells
that
constitute
the
germinal
layers
arise
simply
from
the
continuous
and
repeated
cleaving
segmentation
of
the
original
solitary
cell
it
first
divides
into
two
and
then
into
four
cells
out
of
these
four
cells
are
born
eight
then
sixteen
and
so
on
thus
in
the
embryonic
development
of
every
animal
and
plant
there
is
formed
first
of
all
out
of
the
simple
egg
cell
by
a
repeated
subdivision
a
cluster
of
cells
as
kölliker
had
already
stated
in
connection
with
the
cephalopods
in
the
cells
of
this
group
spread
themselves
out
flat
and
form
leaves
or
plates
each
of
these
leaves
is
formed
exclusively
out
of
cells
the
cells
of
different
layers
assume
different
shapes
increase
and
differentiate
and
in
the
end
there
is
a
further
cleavage
differentiation
and
division
of
work
of
the
cells
within
the
layers
and
from
these
all
the
different
tissues
of
the
body
proceed
these
are
the
simple
foundations
of
or
the
science
that
treats
of
the
development
of
the
tissues
as
it
was
established
by
remak
and
kölliker
remak
in
determining
more
closely
the
part
which
the
different
germinal
layers
play
in
the
formation
of
the
various
tissues
and
organs
and
in
applying
the
theory
of
evolution
to
the
cells
and
the
tissues
they
compose
raised
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
at
least
as
far
as
it
regards
the
vertebrates
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
remak
showed
that
three
layers
are
formed
out
of
the
two
germinal
layers
which
compose
the
first
simple
structure
of
the
vertebrate
body
or
the
as
the
lower
layer
splits
into
two
plates
these
three
layers
have
a
very
definite
relation
to
the
various
tissues
first
of
all
the
cells
which
form
the
outer
skin
of
the
body
the
epidermis
with
its
various
dependencies
hairs
nails
etc
is
to
say
the
entire
outer
envelope
of
the
developed
out
of
the
outer
or
upper
layer
but
there
are
also
developed
in
a
curious
way
out
of
the
same
layer
the
cells
which
form
the
central
nervous
system
the
brain
and
the
spinal
cord
in
the
second
place
the
inner
or
lower
germinal
layer
gives
rise
only
to
the
cells
which
form
the
epithelium
the
whole
inner
lining
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
all
that
depends
on
it
the
lungs
liver
pancreas
etc
or
the
tissues
that
receive
and
prepare
the
nourishment
of
the
body
finally
the
middle
layer
gives
rise
to
all
the
other
tissues
of
the
body
the
muscles
blood
bones
cartilage
etc
remak
further
proved
that
this
middle
layer
which
he
calls
layer
proceeds
to
subdivide
into
two
secondary
layers
thus
we
find
once
more
the
four
layers
which
baer
had
indicated
remak
calls
the
outer
secondary
leaf
of
the
middle
layer
the
it
would
be
better
to
say
layer
it
forms
the
outer
wall
of
the
body
the
true
skin
the
muscles
to
the
inner
secondary
leaf
he
gave
the
name
of
the
this
forms
the
outer
envelope
of
the
alimentary
canal
with
the
mesentery
the
heart
the
etc
on
this
firm
foundation
provided
by
remak
for
or
the
science
of
the
formation
of
the
tissues
our
knowledge
has
been
gradually
built
up
and
enlarged
in
detail
there
have
been
several
attempts
to
restrict
and
even
destroy
principles
the
two
anatomists
reichert
of
berlin
and
wilhelm
his
of
leipzic
especially
have
endeavoured
in
their
works
to
introduce
a
new
conception
of
the
embryonic
development
of
the
vertebrate
according
to
which
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
would
not
be
the
sole
sources
of
formation
but
these
efforts
were
so
seriously
marred
by
ignorance
of
comparative
anatomy
an
imperfect
acquaintance
with
ontogenesis
and
a
complete
neglect
of
phylogenesis
that
they
could
not
have
more
than
a
passing
success
we
can
only
explain
how
these
curious
attacks
of
reichert
and
his
came
to
be
regarded
for
a
time
as
advances
by
the
general
lack
of
discrimination
and
of
grasp
of
the
true
object
of
embryology
wilhelm
his
published
in
his
extensive
researches
into
the
form
of
the
vertebrate
body
one
of
the
curiosities
of
embryological
literature
the
author
imagines
that
he
can
build
a
theory
of
embryonic
by
merely
giving
an
exact
description
of
the
embryology
of
the
chick
without
any
regard
to
comparative
anatomy
and
phylogeny
and
thus
falls
into
an
error
that
is
almost
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
biological
literature
as
the
final
result
of
his
laborious
investigations
his
tells
us
a
comparatively
simple
law
of
growth
is
the
one
essential
thing
in
the
first
development
every
formation
whether
it
consist
in
cleavage
of
layers
or
folding
or
complete
division
is
a
consequence
of
this
fundamental
unfortunately
he
does
not
explain
what
this
of
is
just
as
other
opponents
of
the
theory
of
selection
who
would
put
in
its
place
a
great
of
evolution
omit
to
tell
us
anything
about
the
nature
of
this
nevertheless
it
is
quite
clear
from
works
that
he
imagines
constructive
nature
to
be
a
sort
of
skilful
tailor
the
ingenious
operator
succeeds
in
bringing
into
existence
by
all
the
various
forms
of
living
things
by
cutting
up
in
different
ways
the
germinal
layers
bending
and
folding
tugging
and
splitting
and
so
on
none
of
works
have
been
translated
into
english
embryological
theories
excited
a
good
deal
of
interest
at
the
time
of
publication
and
have
evoked
a
fair
amount
of
literature
in
the
last
few
decades
he
professed
to
explain
the
most
complicated
parts
of
organic
construction
such
as
the
development
of
the
brain
in
the
simplest
way
on
mechanical
principles
and
to
derive
them
immediately
from
simple
physical
processes
such
as
unequal
distribution
of
strain
in
an
elastic
plate
it
is
quite
true
that
a
mechanical
or
monistic
explanation
or
a
reduction
of
natural
processes
is
the
ideal
of
modern
science
and
this
ideal
would
be
realised
if
we
could
succeed
in
expressing
these
formative
processes
in
mathematical
formulæ
his
has
therefore
inserted
plenty
of
numbers
and
measurements
in
his
embryological
works
and
given
them
an
air
of
scholarship
by
putting
in
a
quantity
of
mathematical
tables
unfortunately
they
are
of
no
value
and
do
not
help
us
in
the
least
in
forming
an
acquaintance
with
the
embryonic
phenomena
indeed
they
wander
from
the
true
path
altogether
by
neglecting
the
phylogenetic
method
this
he
thinks
is
mere
and
is
necessary
at
all
for
the
explanation
of
the
facts
of
embryology
which
are
the
direct
consequence
of
physiological
principles
what
his
takes
to
be
a
simple
physical
instance
the
folding
of
the
germinal
layers
in
the
formation
of
the
medullary
tube
alimentary
tube
etc
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
direct
result
of
the
growth
of
the
various
cells
which
form
those
organic
structures
but
these
have
themselves
been
transmitted
by
heredity
from
parents
and
ancestors
and
are
only
the
hereditary
repetition
of
countless
phylogenetic
changes
which
have
taken
place
for
thousands
of
years
in
the
of
the
said
ancestors
each
of
these
historical
changes
was
of
course
originally
due
to
adaptation
it
was
in
other
words
physiological
and
reducible
to
mechanical
causes
but
we
have
naturally
no
means
of
observing
them
now
it
is
only
by
the
hypotheses
of
the
science
of
evolution
that
we
can
form
an
approximate
idea
of
the
organic
links
in
this
historic
chain
all
the
best
recent
research
in
animal
embryology
has
led
to
the
confirmation
and
development
of
baer
and
theory
of
the
germinal
layers
one
of
the
most
important
advances
in
this
direction
of
late
was
the
discovery
that
the
two
primary
layers
out
of
which
is
built
the
body
of
all
vertebrates
including
man
are
also
present
in
all
the
invertebrates
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
lowest
group
the
unicellular
protozoa
huxley
had
detected
them
in
the
medusa
in
he
showed
that
the
two
layers
of
cells
from
which
the
body
of
this
zoophyte
is
developed
correspond
both
morphologically
and
physiologically
to
the
two
original
germinal
layers
of
the
vertebrate
the
outer
layer
from
which
come
the
external
skin
and
the
muscles
was
then
called
by
allman
the
outer
layer
or
skin
the
inner
layer
which
forms
the
alimentary
and
reproductory
organs
was
called
the
inner
layer
in
and
the
following
years
the
discovery
of
the
germinal
layers
was
extended
to
other
groups
of
the
invertebrates
in
particular
the
indefatigable
russian
zoologist
kowalevsky
found
them
in
all
the
most
diverse
sections
of
the
worms
tunicates
echinoderms
molluscs
articulates
etc
in
my
monograph
on
the
sponges
i
proved
that
these
two
primary
germinal
layers
are
also
found
in
that
group
and
that
they
may
be
traced
from
it
right
up
to
man
through
all
the
various
classes
in
identical
form
this
of
the
two
primary
germinal
extends
through
the
whole
of
the
metazoa
or
animals
that
is
to
say
through
the
whole
animal
kingdom
with
the
one
exception
of
its
lowest
section
the
unicellular
beings
or
protozoa
these
lowly
organised
animals
do
not
form
germinal
layers
and
therefore
do
not
succeed
in
forming
true
tissue
their
whole
body
consists
of
a
single
cell
as
is
the
case
with
the
amœbæ
and
infusoria
or
of
a
loose
aggregation
of
only
slightly
differentiated
cells
though
it
may
not
even
reach
the
full
structure
of
a
single
cell
as
with
the
monera
but
in
all
other
animals
the
ovum
first
grows
into
two
primary
layers
the
outer
or
layer
the
ectoderm
epiblast
or
ectoblast
and
the
inner
or
layer
the
entoderm
hypoblast
or
endoblast
and
from
these
the
tissues
and
organs
are
formed
the
first
and
oldest
organ
of
all
these
metazoa
is
the
primitive
gut
or
progaster
and
its
opening
the
primitive
mouth
prostoma
the
typical
embryonic
form
of
the
metazoa
as
it
is
presented
for
a
time
by
this
simple
structure
of
the
body
is
called
the
it
is
to
be
conceived
as
the
hereditary
reproduction
of
some
primitive
common
ancestor
of
the
metazoa
which
we
call
the
this
applies
to
the
sponges
and
other
zoophyta
and
to
the
worms
the
mollusca
echinoderma
articulata
and
vertebrata
all
these
animals
may
be
comprised
under
the
general
heading
of
animals
or
metazoa
in
contradistinction
to
the
gutless
protozoa
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
study
of
the
not
translated
the
important
consequences
of
this
conception
in
the
morphology
and
classification
of
the
animal
world
i
also
divided
the
realm
of
metazoa
into
two
great
groups
the
lower
and
higher
metazoa
in
the
first
are
comprised
the
also
called
zoophytes
or
in
the
lower
forms
of
this
group
the
body
consists
throughout
life
merely
of
the
primary
germinal
layers
with
the
cells
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
differentiated
but
with
the
higher
forms
of
the
cœlentarata
the
corals
higher
medusæ
ctenophoræ
and
platodes
a
middle
layer
or
often
of
considerable
size
is
developed
between
the
other
two
layers
but
blood
and
an
internal
cavity
are
still
lacking
to
the
second
great
group
of
the
metazoa
i
gave
the
name
of
the
or
or
the
bilateral
higher
forms
they
all
have
a
cavity
within
the
body
cœloma
and
most
of
them
have
blood
and
in
this
are
comprised
the
six
higher
stems
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
annulata
and
their
descendants
the
mollusca
echinoderma
articulata
tunicata
and
vertebrata
in
all
these
bilateral
organisms
the
body
is
formed
out
of
four
secondary
germinal
layers
of
which
the
inner
two
construct
the
wall
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
the
outer
two
the
wall
of
the
body
between
the
two
pairs
of
layers
lies
the
cavity
cœloma
although
i
laid
special
stress
on
the
great
morphological
importance
of
this
cavity
in
my
of
the
gastræa
theory
and
endeavoured
to
prove
the
significance
of
the
four
secondary
germinal
layers
in
the
organisation
of
the
cœlomaria
i
was
unable
to
deal
satisfactorily
with
the
difficult
question
of
the
mode
of
their
origin
this
was
done
eight
years
afterwards
by
the
brothers
oscar
and
richard
hertwig
in
their
careful
and
extensive
comparative
studies
in
their
masterly
theory
an
attempt
to
explain
the
middle
germinal
not
translated
they
showed
that
in
most
of
the
metazoa
especially
in
all
the
vertebrates
the
arises
in
the
same
way
by
the
outgrowth
of
two
sacs
from
the
inner
layer
these
two
proceed
from
the
rudimentary
mouth
of
the
gastrula
between
the
two
primary
layers
the
inner
plate
of
the
the
visceral
layer
joins
itself
to
the
entoderm
the
outer
plate
parietal
layer
unites
with
the
ectoderm
thus
are
formed
the
within
and
the
without
and
between
the
two
is
formed
the
cavity
of
the
cœlom
by
the
blending
of
the
right
and
left
we
shall
see
this
more
fully
in
chapter
x
the
many
new
points
of
view
and
fresh
ideas
suggested
by
my
gastræa
theory
and
cœlom
theory
led
to
the
publication
of
a
number
of
writings
on
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
most
of
them
set
out
to
oppose
it
at
first
but
in
the
end
the
majority
supported
it
of
late
years
both
theories
are
accepted
in
their
essential
features
by
nearly
every
competent
man
of
science
and
light
and
order
have
been
introduced
into
this
once
dark
and
contradictory
field
of
research
a
further
cause
of
congratulation
for
this
solution
of
the
great
embryological
controversy
is
that
it
brought
with
it
a
recognition
of
the
need
for
phylogenetic
study
and
explanation
interest
and
practice
in
embryological
research
have
been
remarkably
stimulated
during
the
past
thirty
years
by
this
appreciation
of
phylogenetic
methods
hundreds
of
assiduous
and
able
observers
are
now
engaged
in
the
development
of
comparative
embryology
and
its
establishment
on
a
basis
of
evolution
whereas
they
numbered
only
a
few
dozen
not
many
decades
ago
it
would
take
too
long
to
enumerate
even
the
most
important
of
the
countless
valuable
works
which
have
enriched
embryological
literature
since
that
time
references
to
them
will
be
found
in
the
latest
manuals
of
embryology
of
kölliker
balfour
hertwig
kollman
korschelt
and
heider
des
menschen
und
der
höherer
thiere
the
first
edition
of
which
appeared
years
ago
had
the
rare
merit
at
that
time
of
gathering
into
presentable
form
the
scattered
attainments
of
the
science
and
expounding
them
in
some
sort
of
unity
on
the
basis
of
the
cellular
theory
and
the
theory
of
germinal
layers
unfortunately
the
distinguished
würtzburg
anatomist
to
whom
comparative
anatomy
histology
and
ontogeny
owe
so
much
is
opposed
to
the
theory
of
descent
generally
and
to
darwinism
in
particular
all
the
other
manuals
i
have
mentioned
take
a
decided
stand
on
evolution
francis
balfour
has
carefully
collected
and
presented
with
discrimination
in
his
of
comparative
the
very
scattered
and
extensive
literature
of
the
subject
he
has
also
widened
the
basis
of
the
gastræa
theory
by
a
comparative
description
of
the
rise
of
the
organs
from
the
germinal
layers
in
all
the
chief
groups
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
has
given
a
most
thorough
empirical
support
to
the
principles
i
have
formulated
a
comparison
of
his
work
with
the
excellent
of
the
embryology
of
the
translation
of
korschelt
and
heider
shows
what
astonishing
progress
has
been
made
in
the
science
in
the
course
of
ten
years
i
would
especially
recommend
the
manuals
of
julius
kollmann
and
oscar
hertwig
to
those
readers
who
are
stimulated
to
further
study
by
these
chapters
on
human
embryology
work
is
commendable
for
its
clear
treatment
of
the
subject
and
very
fine
original
illustrations
its
author
adheres
firmly
to
the
biogenetic
law
and
uses
it
throughout
with
considerable
profit
that
is
not
the
case
in
oscar
recent
of
the
embryology
of
man
and
the
translations
and
seventh
edition
this
able
anatomist
has
of
late
often
been
quoted
as
an
opponent
of
the
biogenetic
law
although
he
himself
had
demonstrated
its
great
value
thirty
years
ago
his
recent
vacillation
is
partly
due
to
the
timidity
which
our
scientists
have
with
regard
to
hypotheses
though
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
headway
in
the
explanation
of
facts
without
them
however
the
purely
descriptive
part
of
embryology
in
is
very
thorough
and
reliable
a
new
branch
of
embryological
research
has
been
studied
very
assiduously
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
the
great
importance
which
has
been
attached
to
the
application
of
physical
experiments
to
the
living
organism
for
the
last
hundred
years
and
the
valuable
results
that
it
has
given
to
physiology
in
the
study
of
the
vital
phenomena
have
led
to
its
extension
to
embryology
i
was
the
first
to
make
experiments
of
this
kind
during
a
stay
of
four
months
on
the
canary
island
lanzerote
in
i
there
made
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
almost
unknown
embryology
of
the
siphonophoræ
i
cut
a
number
of
the
embryos
of
these
animals
which
develop
freely
in
the
water
and
pass
through
a
very
curious
transformation
at
an
early
stage
into
several
pieces
and
found
that
a
fresh
organism
more
or
less
complete
according
to
the
size
of
the
piece
was
developed
from
each
particle
more
recently
some
of
my
pupils
have
made
similar
experiments
with
the
embryos
of
vertebrates
especially
the
frog
and
some
of
the
invertebrates
wilhelm
roux
in
particular
has
made
extensive
experiments
and
based
on
them
a
special
embryology
which
has
given
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
discussion
and
controversy
roux
has
published
a
special
journal
for
these
subjects
since
the
für
the
contributions
to
it
are
very
varied
in
value
many
of
them
are
valuable
papers
on
the
physiology
and
pathology
of
the
embryo
pathological
placing
of
the
embryo
in
abnormal
yielded
many
interesting
results
just
as
the
physiology
of
the
normal
body
has
for
a
long
time
derived
assistance
from
the
pathology
of
the
diseased
organism
other
of
these
articles
return
to
the
erroneous
methods
of
his
and
are
only
misleading
this
must
be
said
of
the
many
contributions
of
mechanical
embryology
which
take
up
a
position
of
hostility
to
the
theory
of
descent
and
its
chief
embryological
biogenetic
law
this
law
however
when
rightly
understood
is
not
opposed
to
but
is
the
best
and
most
solid
support
of
a
sound
mechanical
embryology
impartial
reflection
and
a
due
attention
to
paleontology
and
comparative
anatomy
should
convince
these
mechanicists
that
the
facts
they
have
indeed
the
whole
embryological
can
not
be
fully
understood
without
the
theory
of
descent
and
the
biogenetic
law
chapter
iv
the
older
phylogeny
the
embryology
of
man
and
the
animals
the
history
of
which
we
have
reviewed
in
the
last
two
chapters
was
mainly
a
descriptive
science
forty
years
ago
the
earlier
investigations
in
this
province
were
chiefly
directed
to
the
discovery
by
careful
observation
of
the
wonderful
facts
of
the
embryonic
development
of
the
animal
body
from
the
ovum
forty
years
ago
no
one
dared
attack
the
question
of
the
of
these
phenomena
for
fully
a
century
from
the
year
when
solid
appeared
until
when
darwin
published
his
famous
origin
of
species
the
real
causes
of
the
embryonic
processes
were
quite
unknown
no
one
thought
of
seeking
the
agencies
that
effected
this
marvellous
succession
of
structures
the
task
was
thought
to
be
so
difficult
as
almost
to
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
human
thought
it
was
reserved
for
charles
darwin
to
initiate
us
into
the
knowledge
of
these
causes
this
compels
us
to
recognise
in
this
great
genius
who
wrought
a
complete
revolution
in
the
whole
field
of
biology
a
founder
at
the
same
time
of
a
new
period
in
embryology
it
is
true
that
darwin
occupied
himself
very
little
with
direct
embryological
research
and
even
in
his
chief
work
he
only
touches
incidentally
on
the
embryonic
phenomena
but
by
his
reform
of
the
theory
of
descent
and
the
founding
of
the
theory
of
selection
he
has
given
us
the
means
of
attaining
to
a
real
knowledge
of
the
causes
of
embryonic
formation
that
is
in
my
opinion
the
chief
feature
in
incalculable
influence
on
the
whole
science
of
evolution
when
we
turn
our
attention
to
this
latest
period
of
embryological
research
we
pass
into
the
second
division
of
organic
or
phylogeny
i
have
already
indicated
in
chapter
i
the
important
and
intimate
causal
connection
between
these
two
sections
of
the
science
of
the
evolution
of
the
individual
and
that
of
his
ancestors
we
have
formulated
this
connection
in
the
biogenetic
law
the
shorter
evolution
that
of
the
individual
or
is
a
rapid
and
summary
repetition
a
condensed
recapitulation
of
the
larger
evolution
or
that
of
the
species
in
this
principle
we
express
all
the
essential
points
relating
to
the
causes
of
evolution
and
we
shall
seek
throughout
this
work
to
confirm
this
principle
and
lend
it
the
support
of
facts
when
we
look
to
its
significance
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
formulate
the
biogenetic
law
thus
evolution
of
the
species
and
the
stem
shows
us
in
the
physiological
functions
of
heredity
and
adaptation
the
conditioning
causes
on
which
the
evolution
of
the
individual
or
more
briefly
is
the
mechanical
cause
of
but
before
we
examine
the
great
achievement
by
which
darwin
revealed
the
causes
of
evolution
to
us
we
must
glance
at
the
efforts
of
earlier
scientists
to
attain
this
object
our
historical
inquiry
into
these
will
be
even
shorter
than
that
into
the
work
done
in
the
field
of
ontogeny
we
have
very
few
names
to
consider
here
at
the
head
of
them
we
find
the
great
french
naturalist
jean
lamarck
who
first
established
evolution
as
a
scientific
theory
in
even
before
his
time
however
the
chief
philosopher
kant
and
the
chief
poet
goethe
of
germany
had
occupied
themselves
with
the
subject
but
their
efforts
passed
almost
without
recognition
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
of
did
not
arise
until
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
whole
of
the
time
before
this
no
one
had
ventured
to
raise
seriously
the
question
of
the
origin
of
species
which
is
the
culminating
point
of
phylogeny
on
all
sides
it
was
regarded
as
an
insoluble
enigma
the
whole
science
of
the
evolution
of
man
and
the
other
animals
is
intimately
connected
with
the
question
of
the
nature
of
species
or
with
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
the
various
animals
which
we
group
together
under
the
name
of
species
thus
the
definition
of
the
species
becomes
important
it
is
well
known
that
this
definition
was
given
by
linné
who
in
his
famous
was
the
first
to
classify
and
name
the
various
groups
of
animals
and
plants
and
drew
up
an
orderly
scheme
of
the
species
then
known
since
that
time
has
been
the
most
important
and
indispensable
idea
in
descriptive
natural
history
in
zoological
and
botanical
classification
although
there
have
been
endless
controversies
as
to
its
real
meaning
what
then
is
this
linné
himself
appealed
directly
to
the
mosaic
narrative
he
believed
that
as
it
is
stated
in
one
pair
of
each
species
of
animals
and
plants
was
created
in
the
beginning
and
that
all
the
individuals
of
each
species
are
the
descendants
of
these
created
couples
as
for
the
hermaphrodites
organisms
that
have
male
and
female
organs
in
one
being
he
thought
it
sufficed
to
assume
the
creation
of
one
sole
individual
since
this
would
be
fully
competent
to
propagate
its
species
further
developing
these
mystic
ideas
linné
went
on
to
borrow
from
the
account
of
the
deluge
and
of
ark
as
a
ground
for
a
science
of
the
geographical
and
topographical
distribution
of
organisms
he
accepted
the
story
that
all
the
plants
animals
and
men
on
the
earth
were
swept
away
in
a
universal
deluge
except
the
couples
preserved
with
noah
in
the
ark
and
ultimately
landed
on
mount
ararat
this
mountain
seemed
to
linné
particularly
suitable
for
the
landing
as
it
reaches
a
height
of
more
than
feet
and
thus
provides
in
its
higher
zones
the
several
climates
demanded
by
the
various
species
of
animals
and
plants
the
animals
that
were
accustomed
to
a
cold
climate
could
remain
at
the
summit
those
used
to
a
warm
climate
could
descend
to
the
foot
and
those
requiring
a
temperate
climate
could
remain
down
from
this
point
the
of
the
earth
with
animals
and
plants
could
proceed
it
was
impossible
to
have
any
scientific
notion
of
the
method
of
evolution
in
time
as
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
information
paleontology
was
still
wholly
unknown
this
science
of
the
fossil
remains
of
extinct
animals
and
plants
is
very
closely
bound
up
with
the
whole
question
of
evolution
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
origin
of
living
organisms
without
appealing
to
it
but
this
science
did
not
rise
until
a
much
later
date
the
real
founder
of
scientific
paleontology
was
georges
cuvier
the
most
distinguished
zoologist
who
after
linné
worked
at
the
classification
of
the
animal
world
and
effected
a
complete
revolution
in
systematic
zoology
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
species
he
associated
himself
with
linné
and
the
mosaic
story
of
creation
though
this
was
more
difficult
for
him
with
his
acquaintance
with
fossil
remains
he
clearly
showed
that
a
number
of
quite
different
animal
populations
have
lived
on
the
earth
and
he
claimed
that
we
must
distinguish
a
number
of
stages
in
the
history
of
our
planet
each
of
which
was
characterised
by
a
special
population
of
animals
and
plants
these
successive
populations
were
he
said
quite
independent
of
each
other
and
therefore
the
supernatural
creative
act
which
was
demanded
as
the
origin
of
the
animals
and
plants
by
the
dominant
creed
must
have
been
repeated
several
times
in
this
way
a
whole
series
of
different
creative
periods
must
have
succeeded
each
other
and
in
connection
with
these
he
had
to
assume
that
stupendous
revolutions
or
like
the
legendary
have
taken
place
repeatedly
cuvier
was
all
the
more
interested
in
these
catastrophes
or
cataclysms
as
geology
was
just
beginning
to
assert
itself
and
great
progress
was
being
made
in
our
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
formation
of
the
crust
the
various
strata
of
the
crust
were
being
carefully
examined
especially
by
the
famous
geologist
werner
and
his
school
and
the
fossils
found
in
them
were
being
classified
and
these
researches
also
seemed
to
point
to
a
variety
of
creative
periods
in
each
period
the
crust
composed
of
the
various
strata
seemed
to
be
differently
constituted
just
like
the
population
of
animals
and
plants
that
then
lived
on
it
cuvier
combined
this
notion
with
the
results
of
his
own
paleontological
and
zoological
research
and
in
his
effort
to
get
a
consistent
view
of
the
whole
process
of
the
history
he
came
to
form
the
theory
which
is
known
as
catastrophic
theory
or
the
theory
of
terrestrial
revolutions
according
to
this
theory
there
have
been
a
series
of
mighty
cataclysms
on
the
earth
and
these
have
suddenly
destroyed
the
whole
animal
and
plant
population
then
living
on
it
after
each
cataclysm
there
was
a
fresh
creation
of
living
things
throughout
the
earth
as
this
creation
could
not
be
explained
by
natural
laws
it
was
necessary
to
appeal
to
an
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
creator
this
catastrophic
theory
which
cuvier
described
in
a
special
work
was
soon
generally
accepted
and
retained
its
position
in
biology
for
half
a
century
however
theory
was
completely
overthrown
sixty
years
ago
by
the
geologists
led
by
charles
lyell
the
most
distinguished
worker
in
this
field
of
science
lyell
proved
in
his
famous
of
that
the
theory
was
false
in
so
far
as
it
concerned
the
crust
of
the
earth
that
it
was
totally
unnecessary
to
bring
in
supernatural
agencies
or
general
catastrophes
in
order
to
explain
the
structure
and
formation
of
the
mountains
and
that
we
can
explain
them
by
the
familiar
agencies
which
are
at
work
in
altering
and
reconstructing
the
surface
of
the
earth
these
causes
action
of
the
atmosphere
and
water
in
its
various
forms
snow
ice
fog
rain
the
wear
of
the
river
and
the
stormy
ocean
and
the
volcanic
action
which
is
exerted
by
the
molten
central
mass
lyell
convincingly
proved
that
these
natural
causes
are
quite
adequate
to
explain
every
feature
in
the
build
and
formation
of
the
crust
hence
theory
of
cataclysms
was
very
soon
driven
out
of
the
province
of
geology
though
it
remained
for
another
thirty
years
in
undisputed
authority
in
biology
all
the
zoologists
and
botanists
who
gave
any
thought
to
the
question
of
the
origin
of
organisms
adhered
to
erroneous
idea
of
revolutions
and
new
creations
in
order
to
illustrate
the
complete
stagnancy
of
biology
from
to
on
the
question
of
the
origin
of
the
various
species
of
animals
and
plants
i
may
say
from
my
own
experience
that
during
the
whole
of
my
university
studies
i
never
heard
a
single
word
said
about
this
most
important
problem
of
the
science
i
was
fortunate
enough
at
that
time
to
have
the
most
distinguished
masters
for
every
branch
of
biological
science
not
one
of
them
ever
mentioned
this
question
of
the
origin
of
species
not
a
word
was
ever
said
about
the
earlier
efforts
to
understand
the
formation
of
living
things
nor
about
which
had
made
a
fresh
attack
on
the
problem
in
hence
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
enormous
opposition
that
darwin
encountered
when
he
took
up
the
question
for
the
first
time
his
views
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
without
a
single
previous
effort
to
support
them
the
whole
question
of
the
formation
of
living
things
was
considered
by
biologists
until
as
pertaining
to
the
province
of
religion
and
transcendentalism
even
in
speculative
philosophy
in
which
the
question
had
been
approached
from
various
sides
no
one
had
ventured
to
give
it
serious
treatment
this
was
due
to
the
dualistic
system
of
immanuel
kant
who
taught
a
natural
system
of
evolution
as
far
as
the
inorganic
world
was
concerned
but
on
the
whole
adopted
a
supernaturalist
system
as
regards
the
origin
of
living
things
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
is
quite
certain
that
we
can
not
even
satisfactorily
understand
much
less
explain
the
nature
of
an
organism
and
its
internal
forces
on
purely
mechanical
principles
it
is
so
certain
indeed
that
we
may
confidently
say
is
absurd
for
a
man
to
imagine
even
that
some
day
a
newton
will
arise
who
will
explain
the
origin
of
a
single
blade
of
grass
by
natural
laws
not
controlled
by
a
hope
is
entirely
forbidden
in
these
words
kant
definitely
adopts
the
dualistic
and
teleological
point
of
view
for
biological
science
nevertheless
kant
deserted
this
point
of
view
at
times
particularly
in
several
remarkable
passages
which
i
have
dealt
with
at
length
in
my
history
of
chap
v
where
he
expresses
himself
in
the
opposite
or
monistic
sense
in
fact
these
passages
would
justify
one
as
i
showed
in
claiming
his
support
for
the
theory
of
evolution
however
these
monistic
passages
are
only
stray
gleams
of
light
as
a
rule
kant
adheres
in
biology
to
the
obscure
dualistic
ideas
according
to
which
the
forces
at
work
in
inorganic
nature
are
quite
different
from
those
of
the
organic
world
this
dualistic
system
prevails
in
academic
philosophy
of
our
philosophers
still
regarding
these
two
provinces
as
totally
distinct
they
put
on
the
one
side
the
inorganic
or
world
in
which
there
are
at
work
only
mechanical
laws
acting
necessarily
and
without
design
and
on
the
other
the
province
of
organic
nature
in
which
none
of
the
phenomena
can
be
properly
understood
either
as
regards
their
inner
nature
or
their
origin
except
in
the
light
of
preconceived
design
carried
out
by
final
or
purposive
causes
the
prevalence
of
this
unfortunate
dualistic
prejudice
prevented
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
species
and
the
connected
question
of
the
origin
of
man
from
being
regarded
by
the
bulk
of
people
as
a
scientific
question
at
all
until
nevertheless
a
few
distinguished
students
free
from
the
current
prejudice
began
at
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
make
a
serious
attack
on
the
problem
the
merit
of
this
attaches
particularly
to
what
is
known
as
older
school
of
natural
philosophy
which
has
been
so
much
misrepresented
and
which
included
jean
lamarck
buffon
geoffroy
hilaire
and
blainville
in
france
wolfgang
goethe
reinhold
treviranus
schelling
and
lorentz
oken
in
germany
and
erasmus
darwin
in
england
the
gifted
natural
philosopher
who
treated
this
difficult
question
with
the
greatest
sagacity
and
comprehensiveness
was
jean
lamarck
he
was
born
at
bazentin
in
picardy
on
august
he
was
the
son
of
a
clergyman
and
was
destined
for
the
church
but
he
turned
to
seek
glory
in
the
army
and
eventually
devoted
himself
to
science
his
was
the
first
scientific
attempt
to
sketch
the
real
course
of
the
origin
of
species
the
first
history
of
of
plants
animals
and
men
but
as
in
the
case
of
book
this
remarkably
able
work
had
no
influence
whatever
neither
one
nor
the
other
could
obtain
any
recognition
from
their
prejudiced
contemporaries
no
man
of
science
was
stimulated
to
take
an
interest
in
the
work
and
to
develop
the
germs
it
contained
of
the
most
important
biological
truths
the
most
distinguished
botanists
and
zoologists
entirely
rejected
it
and
did
not
even
deign
to
reply
to
it
cuvier
who
lived
and
worked
in
the
same
city
has
not
thought
fit
to
devote
a
single
syllable
to
this
great
achievement
in
his
memoir
on
progress
in
the
sciences
in
which
the
pettiest
observations
found
a
place
in
short
shared
the
fate
of
theory
of
development
and
was
for
half
a
century
ignored
and
neglected
the
german
scientists
especially
oken
and
goethe
who
were
occupied
with
similar
speculations
at
the
same
time
seem
to
have
known
nothing
about
work
if
they
had
known
it
they
would
have
been
greatly
helped
by
it
and
might
have
carried
the
theory
of
evolution
much
farther
than
they
found
it
possible
to
do
to
give
an
idea
of
the
great
importance
of
the
zoologique
i
will
briefly
explain
leading
thought
he
held
that
there
was
no
essential
difference
between
living
and
lifeless
beings
nature
is
one
united
and
connected
system
of
phenomena
and
the
forces
which
fashion
the
lifeless
bodies
are
the
only
ones
at
work
in
the
kingdom
of
living
things
we
have
therefore
to
use
the
same
method
of
investigation
and
explanation
in
both
provinces
life
is
only
a
physical
phenomenon
all
the
plants
and
animals
with
man
at
their
head
are
to
be
explained
in
structure
and
life
by
mechanical
or
efficient
causes
without
any
appeal
to
final
causes
just
as
in
the
case
of
minerals
and
other
inorganic
bodies
this
applies
equally
to
the
origin
of
the
various
species
we
must
not
assume
any
original
creation
or
repeated
creations
as
in
theory
to
explain
this
but
a
natural
continuous
and
necessary
evolution
the
whole
evolutionary
process
has
been
uninterrupted
all
the
different
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
which
we
see
or
that
have
ever
lived
have
descended
in
a
natural
way
from
earlier
and
different
species
all
come
from
one
common
stock
or
from
a
few
common
ancestors
these
remote
ancestors
must
have
been
quite
simple
organisms
of
the
lowest
type
arising
by
spontaneous
generation
from
inorganic
matter
the
succeeding
species
have
been
constantly
modified
by
adaptation
to
their
varying
environment
especially
by
use
and
habit
and
have
transmitted
their
modifications
to
their
successors
by
heredity
lamarck
was
the
first
to
formulate
as
a
scientific
theory
the
natural
origin
of
living
things
including
man
and
to
push
the
theory
to
its
extreme
rise
of
the
earliest
organisms
by
spontaneous
generation
or
abiogenesis
and
the
descent
of
man
from
the
nearest
related
mammal
the
ape
he
sought
to
explain
this
last
point
which
is
of
especial
interest
to
us
here
by
the
same
agencies
which
he
found
at
work
in
the
natural
origin
of
the
plant
and
animal
species
he
considered
use
and
habit
adaptation
on
the
one
hand
and
heredity
on
the
other
to
be
the
chief
of
these
agencies
the
most
important
modifications
of
the
organs
of
plants
and
animals
are
due
in
his
opinion
to
the
function
of
these
very
organs
or
to
the
use
or
disuse
of
them
to
give
a
few
examples
the
woodpecker
and
the
have
got
their
peculiarly
long
tongues
from
the
habit
of
extracting
their
food
with
their
tongues
from
deep
and
narrow
folds
or
canals
the
frog
has
developed
the
web
between
his
toes
by
his
own
swimming
the
giraffe
has
lengthened
his
neck
by
stretching
up
to
the
higher
branches
of
trees
and
so
on
it
is
quite
certain
that
this
use
or
disuse
of
organs
is
a
most
important
factor
in
organic
development
but
it
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
origin
of
species
to
adaptation
we
must
add
heredity
as
the
second
and
not
less
important
agency
as
lamarck
perfectly
recognised
he
said
that
the
modification
of
the
organs
in
any
one
individual
by
use
or
disuse
was
slight
but
that
it
was
increased
by
accumulation
in
passing
by
heredity
from
generation
to
generation
but
he
missed
altogether
the
principle
which
darwin
afterwards
found
to
be
the
chief
factor
in
the
theory
of
the
principle
of
natural
selection
in
the
struggle
for
existence
it
was
partly
owing
to
his
failure
to
detect
this
supremely
important
element
and
partly
to
the
poor
condition
of
all
biological
science
at
the
time
that
lamarck
did
not
succeed
in
establishing
more
firmly
his
theory
of
the
common
descent
of
man
and
the
other
animals
independently
of
lamarck
the
older
german
school
of
natural
philosophy
especially
reinhold
treviranus
in
his
and
lorentz
oken
in
his
turned
its
attention
to
the
problem
of
evolution
about
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
and
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
have
described
its
work
in
my
of
chap
iv
here
i
can
only
deal
with
the
brilliant
genius
whose
evolutionary
ideas
are
of
special
greatest
of
german
poets
wolfgang
goethe
with
his
keen
eye
for
the
beauties
of
nature
and
his
profound
insight
into
its
life
goethe
was
early
attracted
to
the
study
of
various
natural
sciences
it
was
the
favourite
occupation
of
his
leisure
hours
throughout
life
he
gave
particular
and
protracted
attention
to
the
theory
of
colours
but
the
most
valuable
of
his
scientific
studies
are
those
which
relate
to
that
glorious
precious
thing
the
organism
he
made
profound
research
into
the
science
of
structures
or
morphology
morphæ
forms
here
with
the
aid
of
comparative
anatomy
he
obtained
the
most
brilliant
results
and
went
far
in
advance
of
his
time
i
may
mention
in
particular
his
vertebral
theory
of
the
skull
his
discovery
of
the
pineal
gland
in
man
his
system
of
the
metamorphosis
of
plants
etc
these
morphological
studies
led
goethe
on
to
research
into
the
formation
and
modification
of
organic
structures
which
we
must
count
as
the
first
germ
of
the
science
of
evolution
he
approaches
so
near
to
the
theory
of
descent
that
we
must
regard
him
after
lamarck
as
one
of
its
earliest
founders
it
is
true
that
he
never
formulated
a
complete
scientific
theory
of
evolution
but
we
find
a
number
of
remarkable
suggestions
of
it
in
his
splendid
miscellaneous
essays
on
morphology
some
of
them
are
really
among
the
very
basic
ideas
of
the
science
of
evolution
he
says
for
instance
we
compare
plants
and
animals
in
their
most
rudimentary
forms
it
is
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
between
them
but
we
may
say
that
the
plants
and
animals
beginning
with
an
almost
inseparable
closeness
gradually
advance
along
two
divergent
lines
until
the
plant
at
last
grows
in
the
solid
enduring
tree
and
the
animal
attains
in
man
to
the
highest
degree
of
mobility
and
that
goethe
was
not
merely
speaking
in
a
poetical
but
in
a
literal
genealogical
sense
of
this
close
affinity
of
organic
forms
is
clear
from
other
remarkable
passages
in
which
he
treats
of
their
variety
in
outward
form
and
unity
in
internal
structure
he
believes
that
every
living
thing
has
arisen
by
the
interaction
of
two
opposing
formative
forces
or
impulses
the
internal
or
force
the
type
or
to
specification
seeks
to
maintain
the
constancy
of
the
specific
forms
in
the
succession
of
generations
this
is
the
external
or
force
the
element
of
variation
or
to
metamorphosis
is
continually
modifying
the
species
by
changing
their
environment
this
is
in
these
significant
conceptions
goethe
approaches
very
close
to
a
recognition
of
the
two
great
mechanical
factors
which
we
now
assign
as
the
chief
causes
of
the
formation
of
species
however
in
order
to
appreciate
views
on
morphology
one
must
associate
his
decidedly
monistic
conception
of
nature
with
his
pantheistic
philosophy
the
warm
and
keen
interest
with
which
he
followed
in
his
last
years
the
controversies
of
contemporary
french
scientists
and
especially
the
struggle
between
cuvier
and
geoffroy
hilaire
see
chap
iv
of
history
of
is
very
characteristic
it
is
also
necessary
to
be
familiar
with
his
style
and
general
tenour
of
thought
in
order
to
appreciate
rightly
the
many
allusions
to
evolution
found
in
his
writings
otherwise
one
is
apt
to
make
serious
errors
he
approached
so
close
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
principles
of
the
science
of
evolution
that
he
may
well
be
described
as
the
first
forerunner
of
darwin
although
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
formulate
evolution
as
a
scientific
system
as
lamarck
did
chapter
the
modern
science
of
evolution
we
owe
so
much
of
the
progress
of
scientific
knowledge
to
of
that
its
influence
is
almost
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
science
the
literature
of
darwinism
grows
from
day
to
day
not
only
on
the
side
of
academic
zoology
and
botany
the
sciences
which
were
chiefly
affected
by
theory
but
in
a
far
wider
circle
so
that
we
find
darwinism
discussed
in
popular
literature
with
a
vigour
and
zest
that
are
given
to
no
other
scientific
conception
this
remarkable
success
is
due
chiefly
to
two
circumstances
in
the
first
place
all
the
sciences
and
especially
biology
have
made
astounding
progress
in
the
last
and
have
furnished
a
very
vast
quantity
of
proofs
of
the
theory
of
evolution
in
striking
contrast
to
the
failure
of
lamarck
and
the
older
scientists
to
attract
attention
to
their
effort
to
explain
the
origin
of
living
things
and
of
man
we
have
this
second
and
successful
effort
of
darwin
which
was
able
to
gather
to
its
support
a
large
number
of
established
facts
availing
himself
of
the
progress
already
made
he
had
very
different
scientific
proofs
to
allege
than
lamarck
or
hilaire
or
goethe
or
treviranus
had
had
but
in
the
second
place
we
must
acknowledge
that
darwin
had
the
special
distinction
of
approaching
the
subject
from
an
entirely
new
side
and
of
basing
the
theory
of
descent
on
a
consistent
system
which
now
goes
by
the
name
of
darwinism
lamarck
had
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
explain
the
modification
of
organisms
that
descend
from
a
common
form
chiefly
by
the
action
of
habit
and
the
use
of
organs
though
with
the
aid
of
heredity
but
success
was
complete
when
he
independently
sought
to
give
a
mechanical
explanation
on
a
quite
new
ground
of
this
modification
of
plant
and
animal
structures
by
adaptation
and
heredity
he
was
impelled
to
his
theory
of
selection
on
the
following
grounds
he
compared
the
origin
of
the
various
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
which
we
modify
the
action
of
artificial
selection
in
horticulture
and
among
domestic
the
origin
of
the
species
of
animals
and
plants
in
their
natural
state
he
then
found
that
the
agencies
which
we
employ
in
the
modification
of
forms
by
artificial
selection
are
also
at
work
in
nature
the
chief
of
these
agencies
he
held
to
be
struggle
for
the
gist
of
this
peculiarly
darwinian
idea
is
given
in
this
formula
the
struggle
for
existence
produces
new
species
without
premeditated
design
in
the
life
of
nature
in
the
same
way
that
the
will
of
man
consciously
selects
new
races
in
artificial
conditions
the
gardener
or
the
farmer
selects
new
forms
as
he
wills
for
his
own
profit
by
ingeniously
using
the
agency
of
heredity
and
adaptation
for
the
modification
of
structures
so
in
the
natural
state
the
struggle
for
life
is
always
unconsciously
modifying
the
various
species
of
living
things
this
struggle
for
life
or
competition
of
organisms
in
securing
the
means
of
subsistence
acts
without
any
conscious
design
but
it
is
none
the
less
effective
in
modifying
structures
as
heredity
and
adaptation
enter
into
the
closest
reciprocal
action
under
its
influence
new
structures
or
alterations
of
structure
are
produced
and
these
are
purposive
in
the
sense
that
they
serve
the
organism
when
formed
but
they
were
produced
without
any
aim
this
simple
idea
is
the
central
thought
of
darwinism
or
the
theory
of
selection
darwin
conceived
this
idea
at
an
early
date
and
then
for
more
than
twenty
years
worked
at
the
collection
of
empirical
evidence
in
support
of
it
before
he
published
his
theory
his
grandfather
erasmus
darwin
was
an
able
scientist
of
the
older
school
of
natural
philosophy
who
published
a
number
of
works
about
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
most
important
of
them
is
his
published
in
in
which
he
expounds
views
similar
to
those
of
goethe
and
lamarck
without
really
knowing
anything
of
the
work
of
these
contemporaries
however
in
the
writings
of
the
grandfather
the
plastic
imagination
rather
outran
the
judgment
while
in
charles
darwin
the
two
were
better
balanced
darwin
did
not
publish
any
account
of
his
theory
until
when
alfred
russel
wallace
who
had
independently
reached
the
same
theory
of
selection
published
his
own
work
in
the
following
year
appeared
the
of
species
in
which
he
develops
it
at
length
and
supports
it
with
a
mass
of
proof
wallace
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
but
he
had
not
so
clear
a
perception
as
darwin
of
the
effectiveness
of
natural
selection
in
forming
species
and
did
not
develop
the
theory
so
fully
nevertheless
writings
especially
those
on
mimicry
and
an
admirable
work
on
geographical
distribution
of
animals
contain
many
fine
original
contributions
to
the
theory
of
selection
unfortunately
this
gifted
scientist
has
since
devoted
himself
to
spiritism
darwin
and
wallace
arrived
at
the
theory
quite
independently
to
the
theory
of
natural
and
of
had
an
extraordinary
influence
though
not
at
first
on
the
experts
of
the
science
it
took
zoologists
and
botanists
several
years
to
recover
from
the
astonishment
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
through
the
revolutionary
idea
of
the
work
but
its
influence
on
the
special
sciences
with
which
we
zoologists
and
botanists
are
concerned
has
increased
from
year
to
year
it
has
introduced
a
most
healthy
fermentation
in
every
branch
of
biology
especially
in
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
and
in
zoological
and
botanical
classification
in
this
way
it
has
brought
about
almost
a
revolution
in
the
prevailing
views
however
the
point
which
chiefly
concerns
us
extension
of
the
theory
to
not
touched
at
all
in
first
work
in
it
was
believed
for
several
years
that
he
had
no
thought
of
applying
his
principles
to
man
but
that
he
shared
the
current
idea
of
man
holding
a
special
position
in
the
universe
not
only
ignorant
laymen
especially
several
theologians
but
also
a
number
of
men
of
science
said
very
naively
that
darwinism
in
itself
was
not
to
be
opposed
that
it
was
quite
right
to
use
it
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
various
species
of
plants
and
animals
but
that
it
was
totally
inapplicable
to
man
in
the
meantime
however
it
seemed
to
a
good
many
thoughtful
people
laymen
as
well
as
scientists
that
this
was
wrong
that
the
descent
of
man
from
some
other
animal
species
and
immediately
from
some
mammal
followed
logically
and
necessarily
from
reformed
theory
of
evolution
many
of
the
acuter
opponents
of
the
theory
saw
at
once
the
justice
of
this
position
and
as
this
consequence
was
intolerable
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
theory
the
first
scientific
application
of
the
darwinian
theory
to
man
was
made
by
huxley
the
greatest
zoologist
in
england
this
able
and
learned
scientist
to
whom
zoology
owes
much
of
its
progress
published
in
a
small
work
entitled
as
to
place
in
in
the
extremely
important
and
interesting
lectures
which
made
up
this
work
he
proved
clearly
that
the
descent
of
man
from
the
ape
followed
necessarily
from
the
theory
of
descent
if
that
theory
is
true
we
are
bound
to
conceive
the
animals
which
most
closely
resemble
man
as
those
from
which
humanity
has
been
gradually
evolved
about
the
same
time
carl
vogt
published
a
larger
work
on
the
same
subject
we
must
also
mention
gustav
jaeger
and
friedrich
rolle
among
the
zoologists
who
accepted
and
taught
the
theory
of
evolution
immediately
after
the
publication
of
book
and
maintained
that
the
descent
of
man
from
the
lower
animals
logically
followed
from
it
the
latter
published
in
a
work
on
the
origin
and
position
of
man
about
the
same
time
i
attempted
in
the
second
volume
of
my
to
apply
the
theory
of
evolution
to
the
whole
organic
kingdom
including
man
i
endeavoured
to
sketch
the
probable
ancestral
trees
of
the
various
classes
of
the
animal
world
the
protists
and
the
plants
as
it
seemed
necessary
to
do
on
darwinian
principles
and
as
we
can
actually
do
now
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
if
the
theory
of
descent
which
lamarck
first
clearly
formulated
and
darwin
thoroughly
established
is
true
we
should
be
able
to
draw
up
a
natural
classification
of
plants
and
animals
in
the
light
of
their
genealogy
and
to
conceive
the
large
and
small
divisions
of
the
system
as
the
branches
and
twigs
of
an
ancestral
tree
the
eight
genealogical
tables
which
i
inserted
in
the
second
volume
of
the
are
the
first
sketches
of
their
kind
in
chapter
particularly
i
trace
the
chief
stages
in
ancestry
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
follow
it
through
the
vertebrate
stem
i
tried
especially
to
determine
as
well
as
one
could
at
that
time
the
position
of
man
in
the
classification
of
the
mammals
and
its
genealogical
significance
i
have
greatly
improved
this
attempt
and
treated
it
in
a
more
popular
form
in
chaps
of
my
of
huxley
spoke
of
this
one
of
the
greatest
scientific
works
ever
of
which
darwin
said
that
the
of
would
probably
never
have
been
written
if
he
had
seen
it
it
was
not
until
twelve
years
after
the
appearance
of
origin
of
species
that
darwin
published
the
famous
work
which
made
the
application
of
his
theory
to
man
and
crowned
the
splendid
structure
of
his
system
this
important
work
was
descent
of
man
and
selection
in
relation
to
in
this
darwin
expressly
drew
the
conclusion
with
rigorous
logic
that
man
also
must
have
been
developed
out
of
lower
species
and
described
the
important
part
played
by
sexual
selection
in
the
elevation
of
man
and
the
other
higher
animals
he
showed
that
the
careful
selection
which
the
sexes
exercise
on
each
other
in
regard
to
sexual
relations
and
procreation
and
the
æsthetic
feeling
which
the
higher
animals
develop
through
this
are
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
progressive
development
of
forms
and
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
the
males
choosing
the
handsomest
females
in
one
class
of
animals
and
the
females
choosing
only
the
males
in
another
the
special
features
and
the
sexual
characteristics
are
increasingly
accentuated
in
fact
some
of
the
higher
animals
develop
in
this
connection
a
finer
taste
and
judgment
than
man
himself
but
even
as
regards
man
it
is
to
this
sexual
selection
that
we
owe
the
which
is
the
chief
foundation
of
civilisation
the
rise
of
the
human
race
is
due
for
the
most
part
to
the
advanced
sexual
selection
which
our
ancestors
exercised
in
choosing
their
mates
darwin
accepted
in
the
main
the
general
outlines
of
ancestral
tree
as
i
gave
it
in
the
and
the
of
creation
and
admitted
that
his
studies
led
him
to
the
same
conclusion
that
he
did
not
at
once
apply
the
theory
to
man
in
his
first
work
was
a
commendable
piece
of
discretion
such
a
sequel
was
bound
to
excite
the
strongest
opposition
to
the
whole
theory
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
establish
it
as
regards
the
animal
and
plant
worlds
the
subsequent
extension
to
man
was
bound
to
be
made
sooner
or
later
it
is
important
to
understand
this
very
clearly
if
all
living
things
come
from
a
common
root
man
must
be
included
in
the
general
scheme
of
evolution
on
the
other
hand
if
the
various
species
were
separately
created
man
too
must
have
been
created
and
not
evolved
we
have
to
choose
between
these
two
alternatives
this
can
not
be
too
frequently
or
too
strongly
emphasised
all
the
species
of
animals
and
plants
are
of
supernatural
not
in
that
case
man
also
is
the
outcome
of
a
creative
act
as
religion
teaches
the
different
species
have
been
evolved
from
a
few
common
simple
ancestral
forms
and
in
that
case
man
is
the
highest
fruit
of
the
tree
of
evolution
we
may
state
this
briefly
in
the
following
descent
of
man
from
the
lower
animals
is
a
special
deduction
which
inevitably
follows
from
the
general
inductive
law
of
the
whole
theory
of
in
this
principle
we
have
a
clear
and
plain
statement
of
the
matter
evolution
is
in
reality
nothing
but
a
great
induction
which
we
are
compelled
to
make
by
the
comparative
study
of
the
most
important
facts
of
morphology
and
physiology
but
we
must
draw
our
conclusion
according
to
the
laws
of
induction
and
not
attempt
to
determine
scientific
truths
by
direct
measurement
and
mathematical
calculation
in
the
study
of
living
things
we
can
scarcely
ever
directly
and
fully
and
with
mathematical
accuracy
determine
the
nature
of
phenomena
as
is
done
in
the
simpler
study
of
the
inorganic
chemistry
physics
mineralogy
and
astronomy
in
the
latter
especially
we
can
always
use
the
simplest
and
absolutely
safest
of
mathematical
determination
but
in
biology
this
is
quite
impossible
for
various
reasons
one
very
obvious
reason
being
that
most
of
the
facts
of
the
science
are
very
complicated
and
much
too
intricate
to
allow
a
direct
mathematical
analysis
the
greater
part
of
the
phenomena
that
biology
deals
with
are
complicated
processes
which
are
related
to
a
past
and
as
a
rule
can
only
be
approximately
estimated
hence
we
have
to
proceed
by
is
to
say
to
draw
general
conclusions
stage
by
stage
and
with
proportionate
confidence
from
the
accumulation
of
detailed
observations
these
inductive
conclusions
can
not
command
absolute
confidence
like
mathematical
axioms
but
they
approach
the
truth
and
gain
increasing
probability
in
proportion
as
we
extend
the
basis
of
observed
facts
on
which
we
build
the
importance
of
these
inductive
laws
is
not
diminished
from
the
circumstance
that
they
are
looked
upon
merely
as
temporary
acquisitions
of
science
and
may
be
improved
to
any
extent
in
the
progress
of
scientific
knowledge
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
attainments
of
many
other
sciences
such
as
geology
or
archeology
however
much
they
may
be
altered
and
improved
in
detail
in
the
course
of
time
these
inductive
truths
may
retain
their
substance
unchanged
now
when
we
say
that
the
theory
of
evolution
in
the
sense
of
lamarck
and
darwin
is
an
inductive
fact
the
greatest
of
all
biological
rely
in
the
first
place
on
the
facts
of
paleontology
this
science
gives
us
some
direct
acquaintance
with
the
historical
phenomena
of
the
changes
of
species
from
the
situations
in
which
we
find
the
fossils
in
the
various
strata
of
the
earth
we
gather
confidently
in
the
first
place
that
the
living
population
of
the
earth
has
been
gradually
developed
as
clearly
as
the
crust
itself
and
that
in
the
second
place
several
different
populations
have
succeeded
each
other
in
the
various
geological
periods
modern
geology
teaches
that
the
formation
of
the
earth
has
been
gradual
and
unbroken
by
any
violent
revolutions
and
when
we
compare
together
the
various
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
which
succeed
each
other
in
the
history
of
our
planet
we
find
in
the
first
place
a
constant
and
gradual
increase
in
the
number
of
species
from
the
earliest
times
until
the
present
day
and
in
the
second
place
we
notice
that
the
forms
in
each
great
group
of
animals
and
plants
also
constantly
improve
as
the
ages
advance
thus
of
the
vertebrates
there
are
at
first
only
the
lower
fishes
then
come
the
higher
fishes
and
later
the
amphibia
still
later
appear
the
three
higher
classes
of
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
for
the
first
time
only
the
lowest
and
least
perfect
forms
of
the
mammals
are
found
at
first
and
it
is
only
at
a
very
late
period
that
placental
mammals
appear
and
man
belongs
to
the
latest
and
youngest
branch
of
these
thus
perfection
of
form
increases
as
well
as
variety
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
stage
that
is
a
fact
of
the
greatest
importance
it
can
only
be
explained
by
the
theory
of
evolution
with
which
it
is
in
perfect
harmony
if
the
different
groups
of
plants
and
animals
do
really
descend
from
each
other
we
must
expect
to
find
this
increase
in
their
number
and
perfection
under
the
influence
of
natural
selection
just
as
the
succession
of
fossils
actually
discloses
it
to
us
comparative
anatomy
furnishes
a
second
series
of
facts
which
are
of
great
importance
for
the
forming
of
our
inductive
law
this
branch
of
morphology
compares
the
adult
structures
of
living
things
and
seeks
in
the
great
variety
of
organic
forms
the
stable
and
simple
law
of
organisation
or
the
common
type
or
structure
since
cuvier
founded
this
science
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
has
been
a
favourite
study
of
the
most
distinguished
scientists
even
before
time
goethe
had
been
greatly
stimulated
by
it
and
induced
to
take
up
the
study
of
morphology
comparative
osteology
or
the
philosophic
study
and
comparison
of
the
bony
skeleton
of
the
of
its
most
interesting
fascinated
him
and
led
him
to
form
the
theory
of
the
skull
which
i
mentioned
before
comparative
anatomy
shows
that
the
internal
structure
of
the
animals
of
each
stem
and
the
plants
of
each
class
is
the
same
in
its
essential
features
however
much
they
differ
in
external
appearance
thus
man
has
so
great
a
resemblance
in
the
chief
features
of
his
internal
organisation
to
the
other
mammals
that
no
comparative
anatomist
has
ever
doubted
that
he
belongs
to
this
class
the
whole
internal
structure
of
the
human
body
the
arrangement
of
its
various
systems
of
organs
the
distribution
of
the
bones
muscles
and
the
whole
structure
of
these
organs
in
the
larger
and
the
finer
scale
agree
so
closely
with
those
of
the
other
mammals
such
as
the
apes
rodents
ungulates
cetacea
marsupials
etc
that
their
external
differences
are
of
no
account
whatever
we
learn
further
from
comparative
anatomy
that
the
chief
features
of
animal
structure
are
so
similar
in
the
various
classes
fifty
to
sixty
in
number
altogether
that
they
may
all
be
comprised
in
from
eight
to
twelve
great
groups
but
even
in
these
groups
the
or
animal
types
certain
organs
especially
the
alimentary
canal
can
be
proved
to
have
been
originally
the
same
for
all
we
can
only
explain
by
the
theory
of
evolution
this
essential
unity
in
internal
structure
of
all
these
animal
forms
that
differ
so
much
in
outward
appearance
this
wonderful
fact
can
only
be
really
understood
and
explained
when
we
regard
the
internal
resemblance
as
an
inheritance
from
forms
and
the
external
differences
as
the
effect
of
adaptation
to
different
environments
in
recognising
this
comparative
anatomy
has
itself
advanced
to
a
higher
stage
gegenbaur
the
most
distinguished
of
recent
students
of
this
science
says
that
with
the
theory
of
evolution
a
new
period
began
in
comparative
anatomy
and
that
the
theory
in
turn
found
a
touch
stone
in
the
science
to
now
there
is
no
fact
in
comparative
anatomy
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
evolution
indeed
they
all
lead
to
it
in
this
way
the
theory
receives
back
from
the
science
all
the
service
it
rendered
to
its
until
then
students
had
marvelled
at
the
wonderful
resemblance
of
living
things
in
their
inner
structure
without
being
able
to
explain
it
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
explain
the
causes
of
this
by
showing
that
this
remarkable
agreement
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
inheriting
of
common
while
the
striking
difference
in
outward
appearance
is
a
result
of
adaptation
to
changes
of
environment
heredity
and
adaptation
alone
furnish
the
true
explanation
but
one
special
part
of
comparative
anatomy
is
of
supreme
interest
and
of
the
utmost
philosophic
importance
in
this
connection
this
is
the
science
of
rudimentary
or
useless
organs
i
have
given
it
the
name
of
in
view
of
its
philosophic
consequences
nearly
every
organism
apart
from
the
very
lowest
and
especially
every
animal
or
plant
including
man
has
one
or
more
organs
which
are
of
no
use
to
the
body
itself
and
have
no
share
in
its
functions
or
vital
aims
thus
we
all
have
in
various
parts
of
our
frame
muscles
which
we
never
use
as
for
instance
in
the
shell
of
the
ear
and
adjoining
parts
in
most
of
the
mammals
especially
those
with
pointed
ears
these
internal
and
external
are
of
great
service
in
altering
the
shell
of
the
ear
so
as
to
catch
the
waves
of
sound
as
much
as
possible
but
in
the
case
of
man
and
other
mammals
these
muscles
are
useless
though
they
are
still
present
our
ancestors
having
long
abandoned
the
use
of
them
we
can
not
work
them
at
all
in
the
inner
corner
of
the
eye
we
have
a
small
fold
of
skin
this
is
the
last
relic
of
a
third
inner
called
the
nictitating
winking
membrane
this
membrane
is
highly
developed
and
of
great
service
in
some
of
our
distant
relations
such
as
fishes
of
the
shark
type
and
several
other
vertebrates
in
us
it
is
shrunken
and
useless
in
the
intestines
we
have
a
process
that
is
not
only
quite
useless
but
may
be
very
vermiform
appendage
this
small
intestinal
appendage
is
often
the
cause
of
a
fatal
illness
if
a
or
other
hard
body
is
unfortunately
squeezed
through
its
narrow
aperture
during
digestion
a
violent
inflammation
is
set
up
and
often
proves
fatal
this
appendix
has
no
use
whatever
now
in
our
frame
it
is
a
dangerous
relic
of
an
organ
that
was
much
larger
and
was
of
great
service
in
our
vegetarian
ancestors
it
is
still
large
and
important
in
many
vegetarian
animals
such
as
apes
and
rodents
there
are
similar
rudimentary
organs
in
all
parts
of
our
body
and
in
all
the
higher
animals
they
are
among
the
most
interesting
phenomena
to
which
comparative
anatomy
introduces
us
partly
because
they
furnish
one
of
the
clearest
proofs
of
evolution
and
partly
because
they
most
strikingly
refute
the
teleology
of
certain
philosophers
the
theory
of
evolution
enables
us
to
give
a
very
simple
explanation
of
these
phenomena
we
have
to
look
on
them
as
organs
which
have
fallen
into
disuse
in
the
course
of
many
generations
with
the
decrease
in
the
use
of
its
function
the
organ
itself
shrivels
up
gradually
and
finally
disappears
there
is
no
other
way
of
explaining
rudimentary
organs
hence
they
are
also
of
great
interest
in
philosophy
they
show
clearly
that
the
or
mechanical
view
of
the
organism
is
the
only
correct
one
and
that
the
or
teleological
conception
is
wrong
the
ancient
legend
of
the
direct
creation
of
man
according
to
a
plan
and
the
empty
phrases
about
in
the
organism
are
completely
shattered
by
them
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
a
more
thorough
refutation
of
teleology
than
is
furnished
by
the
fact
that
all
the
higher
animals
have
these
rudimentary
organs
the
theory
of
evolution
finds
its
broadest
inductive
foundation
in
the
natural
classification
of
living
things
which
arranges
all
the
various
forms
in
larger
and
smaller
groups
according
to
their
degree
of
affinity
these
groupings
or
categories
of
varieties
species
genera
families
orders
classes
such
constant
features
of
coordination
and
subordination
that
we
are
bound
to
look
on
them
as
and
represent
the
whole
system
in
the
form
of
a
branching
tree
this
is
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
variously
related
groups
their
likeness
in
form
is
the
expression
of
a
real
affinity
as
it
is
impossible
to
explain
in
any
other
way
the
natural
form
of
the
system
of
organisms
we
must
regard
it
at
once
as
a
weighty
proof
of
the
truth
of
evolution
the
careful
construction
of
these
genealogical
trees
is
therefore
not
an
amusement
but
the
chief
task
of
modern
classification
among
the
chief
phenomena
that
bear
witness
to
the
inductive
law
of
evolution
we
have
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
various
species
of
animals
and
plants
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
their
topographical
distribution
on
the
summits
of
mountains
and
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
the
scientific
study
of
these
of
distribution
or
chorology
a
place
been
pursued
with
lively
interest
since
the
discoveries
made
by
alexander
von
humboldt
until
time
the
work
was
confined
to
the
determination
of
the
facts
of
the
science
and
chiefly
aimed
at
settling
the
spheres
of
distribution
of
the
existing
large
and
small
groups
of
living
things
it
was
impossible
at
that
time
to
explain
the
causes
of
this
remarkable
distribution
or
the
reasons
why
one
group
is
found
only
in
one
locality
and
another
in
a
different
place
and
why
there
is
this
manifold
distribution
at
all
here
again
the
theory
of
evolution
has
given
us
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
furnishes
the
only
possible
explanation
when
it
teaches
that
the
various
species
and
groups
of
species
descend
from
common
whose
offspring
have
gradually
spread
themselves
by
migration
over
the
earth
for
each
group
of
species
we
must
admit
a
of
production
or
common
home
this
is
the
original
habitat
in
which
the
ancestral
form
was
developed
and
from
which
its
descendants
spread
out
in
every
direction
several
of
these
descendants
became
in
their
turn
the
for
new
groups
of
species
and
these
also
scattered
themselves
by
active
and
passive
migration
and
so
on
as
each
migrating
organism
found
a
different
environment
in
its
new
home
and
adapted
itself
to
it
it
was
modified
and
gave
rise
to
new
forms
this
very
important
branch
of
science
that
deals
with
active
and
passive
migration
was
founded
by
darwin
with
the
aid
of
the
theory
of
evolution
and
at
the
same
time
he
advanced
the
true
explanation
of
the
remarkable
relation
or
similarity
of
the
living
population
in
any
locality
to
the
fossil
forms
found
in
it
moritz
wagner
very
ably
developed
his
idea
under
the
title
of
theory
of
in
my
opinion
this
famous
traveller
has
rather
the
value
of
his
theory
of
migration
when
he
takes
it
to
be
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
formation
of
new
species
and
opposes
the
theory
of
selection
the
two
theories
are
not
opposed
in
their
main
features
migration
by
which
the
of
a
new
species
is
isolated
is
really
only
a
special
case
of
selection
the
striking
and
interesting
facts
of
chorology
can
be
explained
only
by
the
theory
of
evolution
and
therefore
we
must
count
them
among
the
most
important
of
its
inductive
bases
the
same
must
be
said
of
all
the
remarkable
phenomena
which
we
perceive
in
the
economy
of
the
living
organism
the
many
and
various
relations
of
plants
and
animals
to
each
other
and
to
their
environment
which
are
treated
in
from
law
or
norm
and
life
the
interesting
facts
of
parasitism
domesticity
care
of
the
young
social
habits
can
only
be
explained
by
the
action
of
heredity
and
adaptation
formerly
people
saw
only
the
guidance
of
a
beneficent
providence
in
these
phenomena
we
discover
in
them
admirable
proofs
of
the
theory
of
evolution
it
is
impossible
to
understand
them
except
in
the
light
of
this
theory
and
the
struggle
for
life
finally
we
must
in
my
opinion
count
among
the
chief
inductive
bases
of
the
theory
of
evolution
the
fœtal
development
of
the
individual
organism
the
whole
science
of
embryology
or
ontogeny
but
as
the
later
chapters
will
deal
with
this
in
detail
i
need
say
nothing
further
here
i
shall
endeavour
in
the
following
pages
to
show
step
by
step
how
the
whole
of
the
embryonic
phenomena
form
a
massive
chain
of
proof
for
the
theory
of
evolution
for
they
can
be
explained
in
no
other
way
in
thus
appealing
to
the
close
causal
connection
between
ontogenesis
and
phylogenesis
and
taking
our
stand
throughout
on
the
biogenetic
law
we
shall
be
able
to
prove
stage
by
stage
from
the
facts
of
embryology
the
evolution
of
man
from
the
lower
animals
the
general
adoption
of
the
theory
of
evolution
has
definitely
closed
the
controversy
as
to
the
nature
or
definition
of
the
species
the
word
has
no
meaning
whatever
but
is
only
a
or
category
of
classification
with
a
purely
relative
value
in
it
is
true
a
famous
and
gifted
but
inaccurate
and
dogmatic
scientist
louis
agassiz
attempted
to
give
an
absolute
value
to
these
of
he
did
this
in
his
on
classification
in
which
he
turns
upside
down
the
phenomena
of
organic
nature
and
instead
of
tracing
them
to
their
natural
causes
examines
them
through
a
theological
prism
the
true
species
was
he
said
an
idea
of
the
unfortunately
this
pretty
phrase
has
no
more
scientific
value
than
all
the
other
attempts
to
save
the
absolute
or
intrinsic
value
of
the
species
the
dogma
of
the
fixity
and
creation
of
species
lost
its
last
great
champion
when
agassiz
died
in
the
opposite
theory
that
all
the
different
species
descend
from
common
encounters
no
serious
difficulty
all
the
endless
research
into
the
nature
of
the
species
and
the
possibility
of
several
species
descending
from
a
common
ancestor
has
been
closed
by
the
removal
of
the
sharp
limits
that
had
been
set
up
between
species
and
varieties
on
the
one
hand
and
species
and
genera
on
the
other
i
gave
an
analytic
proof
of
this
in
my
monograph
on
the
sponges
having
made
a
very
close
study
of
variability
in
this
small
but
highly
instructive
group
and
shown
the
impossibility
of
making
any
dogmatic
distinction
of
species
according
as
the
classifier
takes
his
ideas
of
genus
species
and
variety
in
a
broader
or
in
a
narrower
sense
he
will
find
in
the
small
group
of
the

either
one
genus
with

species
or
three
genera
with

or
genera
with

moreover
all
these
forms
are
so
connected
by
intermediate
forms
that
we
can
convincingly
prove
the
descent
of
all
the
sponges
from
a
common
the
olynthus
here
i
think
i
have
given
an
analytic
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
species
and
so
met
the
demand
of
certain
opponents
of
evolution
for
an
actual
instance
of
descent
from
a
those
who
are
not
satisfied
with
the
synthetic
proofs
of
the
theory
of
evolution
which
are
provided
by
comparative
anatomy
embryology
paleontology
dysteleology
chorology
and
classification
may
try
to
refute
the
analytic
proof
given
in
my
treatise
on
the
sponge
the
outcome
of
five
years
of
assiduous
study
i
repeat
it
is
now
impossible
to
oppose
evolution
on
the
ground
that
we
have
no
convincing
example
of
the
descent
of
all
the
species
of
a
group
from
a
common
ancestor
the
monograph
on
the
sponges
furnishes
such
a
proof
and
in
my
opinion
an
indisputable
proof
any
man
of
science
who
will
follow
the
protracted
steps
of
my
inquiry
and
test
my
assertions
will
find
that
in
the
case
of
the
sponges
we
can
follow
the
actual
evolution
of
species
in
a
concrete
case
and
if
this
is
so
if
we
can
show
the
origin
of
all
the
species
from
a
common
form
in
one
single
class
we
have
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
origin
because
we
are
in
a
position
to
prove
clearly
his
descent
from
the
lower
animals
at
the
same
time
we
can
now
reply
to
the
assertion
even
heard
from
scientists
of
our
own
day
that
the
descent
of
man
from
the
lower
animals
and
proximately
from
the
apes
still
needs
to
be
with
these
have
been
available
for
a
long
time
one
has
only
to
open
eyes
to
see
them
it
is
a
mistake
to
seek
them
in
the
discovery
of
intermediate
forms
between
man
and
the
ape
or
the
conversion
of
an
ape
into
a
human
being
by
skilful
education
the
proofs
lie
in
the
great
mass
of
empirical
material
we
have
already
collected
they
are
furnished
in
the
strongest
form
by
the
data
of
comparative
anatomy
and
embryology
completed
by
paleontology
it
is
not
a
question
now
of
detecting
new
proofs
of
the
evolution
of
man
but
of
examining
and
understanding
the
proofs
we
already
have
i
was
almost
alone
years
ago
when
i
made
the
first
attempt
in
my
morphology
to
put
organic
science
on
a
mechanical
foundation
through
theory
of
descent
the
association
of
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
and
the
proof
of
the
intimate
causal
connection
between
these
two
sections
of
the
science
of
evolution
which
i
expounded
in
my
work
met
with
the
most
spirited
opposition
on
nearly
all
sides
the
next
ten
years
were
a
terrible
for
for
the
new
theory
but
for
the
last
years
the
tables
have
been
turned
the
phylogenetic
method
has
met
with
so
general
a
reception
and
found
so
prolific
a
use
in
every
branch
of
biology
that
it
seems
superfluous
to
treat
any
further
here
of
its
validity
and
results
the
proof
of
it
lies
in
the
whole
morphological
literature
of
the
last
three
decades
but
no
other
science
has
been
so
profoundly
modified
in
its
leading
thoughts
by
this
adoption
and
been
forced
to
yield
such
consequences
as
that
science
which
i
am
now
seeking
to
anthropogeny
this
statement
may
seem
to
be
rather
audacious
since
the
very
next
branch
of
biology
anthropology
in
the
stricter
sense
makes
very
little
use
of
these
results
of
anthropogeny
and
sometimes
expressly
opposes
them
this
applies
especially
to
the
attitude
which
has
characterised
the
german
anthropological
society
the
gesellschaft
fur
for
some
thirty
years
its
powerful
president
the
famous
pathologist
rudolph
virchow
is
chiefly
responsible
for
this
until
his
death
september
he
never
ceased
to
reject
the
theory
of
descent
as
unproven
and
to
ridicule
its
chief
descent
of
man
from
a
series
of
mammal
a
fantastic
dream
i
need
only
recall
his
expression
at
the
anthropological
congress
at
vienna
in
that
would
be
just
as
well
to
say
man
came
from
the
sheep
or
the
elephant
as
from
the
this
does
not
apply
to
english
anthropologists
who
are
almost
all
evolutionists
assistant
the
secretary
of
the
german
anthropological
society
professor
johannes
ranke
of
munich
has
also
indefatigably
opposed
transformism
he
has
succeeded
in
writing
a
work
in
two
volumes
in
which
all
the
facts
relating
to
his
organisation
are
explained
in
a
sense
hostile
to
evolution
this
work
has
had
a
wide
circulation
owing
to
its
admirable
illustrations
and
its
able
treatment
of
the
most
interesting
facts
of
anatomy
and
of
the
sexual
organs
but
as
it
has
done
a
great
deal
to
spread
erroneous
views
among
the
general
public
i
have
included
a
criticism
of
it
in
my
of
creation
as
well
as
met
attacks
on
anthropogeny
neither
virchow
nor
ranke
nor
any
other
anthropologist
has
attempted
to
give
any
other
natural
explanation
of
the
origin
of
man
they
have
either
set
completely
aside
this
of
as
a
transcendental
problem
or
they
have
appealed
to
religion
for
its
solution
we
have
to
show
that
this
rejection
of
the
rational
explanation
is
totally
without
justification
the
fund
of
knowledge
which
has
accumulated
in
the
progress
of
biology
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
quite
adequate
to
furnish
a
rational
explanation
and
to
establish
the
theory
of
the
evolution
of
man
on
the
solid
facts
of
his
embryology
chapter
vi
the
ovum
and
the
amœba
in
order
to
understand
clearly
the
course
of
human
embryology
we
must
select
the
more
important
of
its
wonderful
and
manifold
processes
for
fuller
explanation
and
then
proceed
from
these
to
the
innumerable
features
of
less
importance
the
most
important
feature
in
this
sense
and
the
best
for
ontogenetic
study
is
the
fact
that
man
is
developed
from
an
ovum
and
that
this
ovum
is
a
simple
cell
the
human
ovum
does
not
materially
differ
in
form
and
composition
from
that
of
the
other
mammals
whereas
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
the
fertilised
ovum
of
the
mammal
and
that
of
any
other
animal
the
human
ovum
fig
human
ovum
the
globular
mass
of
yelk
is
enclosed
by
a
transparent
membrane
the
ovolemma
or
zona
pellucida
and
contains
a
noncentral
nucleus
the
germinal
vesicle
cf
fig
this
fact
is
so
important
that
few
should
be
unaware
of
its
extreme
significance
yet
it
was
quite
unknown
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
we
have
seen
the
human
and
mammal
ovum
was
not
discovered
until
when
carl
ernst
von
baer
detected
it
up
to
that
time
the
larger
vesicles
in
which
the
real
and
much
smaller
ovum
is
contained
had
been
wrongly
regarded
as
ova
the
important
circumstance
that
this
mammal
ovum
is
a
simple
cell
like
the
ovum
of
other
animals
could
not
of
course
be
recognised
until
the
cell
theory
was
established
this
was
not
done
by
schleiden
for
the
plant
and
schwann
for
the
animal
until
as
we
have
seen
this
cell
theory
is
of
the
greatest
service
in
explaining
the
human
frame
and
its
embryonic
development
hence
we
must
say
a
few
words
about
the
actual
condition
of
the
theory
and
the
significance
of
the
views
it
has
suggested
in
order
properly
to
appreciate
the
cellular
theory
the
most
important
element
in
our
science
it
is
necessary
to
understand
in
the
first
place
that
the
cell
is
a
organism
a
living
being
when
we
anatomically
dissect
the
animal
or
plant
into
its
various
organs
and
then
examine
the
finer
structure
of
these
organs
with
the
microscope
we
are
surprised
to
find
that
all
these
different
parts
are
ultimately
made
up
of
the
same
structural
element
or
unit
this
common
unit
of
structure
is
the
cell
it
does
not
matter
whether
we
thus
dissect
a
leaf
flower
or
fruit
or
a
bone
muscle
gland
or
bit
of
skin
etc
we
find
in
every
case
the
same
ultimate
constituent
which
has
been
called
the
cell
since
discovery
there
are
many
opinions
as
to
its
real
nature
but
the
essential
point
in
our
view
of
the
cell
is
to
look
upon
it
as
a
or
independent
living
unit
it
is
in
the
words
of
brucke
elementary
we
may
define
it
most
precisely
as
the
ultimate
organic
unit
and
as
the
cells
are
the
sole
active
principles
in
every
vital
function
we
may
call
them
the
or
this
unity
is
found
in
both
the
anatomic
structure
and
the
physiological
function
in
the
case
of
the
protists
the
entire
organism
usually
consists
of
a
single
independent
cell
throughout
life
but
in
the
animals
and
plants
which
are
the
great
majority
the
organism
begins
its
career
as
a
simple
cell
and
then
grows
into
a
or
more
correctly
an
organised
our
own
body
is
not
really
the
simple
unity
that
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
very
elaborate
social
system
of
countless
microscopic
organisms
a
colony
or
commonwealth
made
up
of
innumerable
independent
units
or
very
different
in
reality
the
term
which
existed
long
before
the
cell
theory
was
formulated
is
not
happily
chosen
schleiden
who
first
brought
it
into
scientific
use
in
the
sense
of
the
cell
theory
gave
this
name
to
the
elementary
organisms
because
when
you
find
them
in
the
dissected
plant
they
generally
have
the
appearance
of
chambers
like
the
cells
in
a
with
firm
walls
and
a
fluid
or
pulpy
content
but
some
cells
especially
young
ones
are
entirely
without
the
enveloping
membrane
or
stiff
wall
hence
we
now
generally
describe
the
cell
as
a
living
viscous
particle
of
protoplasm
enclosing
a
firmer
nucleus
in
its
albuminoid
body
there
may
be
an
enclosing
membrane
as
there
actually
is
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
plants
but
it
may
be
wholly
lacking
as
is
the
case
with
most
of
the
animals
there
is
no
membrane
at
all
in
the
first
stage
the
young
cells
are
usually
round
but
they
vary
much
in
shape
later
on
illustrations
of
this
will
be
found
in
the
cells
of
the
various
parts
of
the
body
shown
in
figs
hence
the
essential
point
in
the
modern
idea
of
the
cell
is
that
it
is
made
up
of
two
different
active
inner
and
an
outer
part
the
smaller
and
inner
part
is
the
nucleus
or
or
fig
and
fig
the
outer
and
larger
part
which
encloses
the
other
is
the
body
of
the
cell
cytos
or
the
soft
living
substance
of
which
the
two
are
composed
has
a
peculiar
chemical
composition
and
belongs
to
the
group
of
the
albuminoid
or
protoplasm
the
essential
and
indispensable
element
of
the
nucleus
is
called
nuclein
or
caryoplasm
that
of
the
cell
body
is
called
plastin
or
cytoplasm
in
the
most
rudimentary
cases
both
substances
seem
to
be
quite
simple
and
homogeneous
without
any
visible
structure
but
as
a
rule
when
we
examine
them
under
a
high
power
of
the
microscope
we
find
a
certain
structure
in
the
protoplasm
the
chief
and
most
common
form
of
this
is
the
fibrous
or
frommann
and
the
frothy
bütschli
of
one
of
the
echinoderms
fig
of
one
of
the
echinoderms
cytula
or
fertilised
ovum
after
is
the
nucleus
or
caryon
the
shape
or
outer
form
of
the
cell
is
infinitely
varied
in
accordance
with
its
endless
power
of
adapting
itself
to
the
most
diverse
activities
or
environments
in
its
simplest
form
the
cell
is
globular
fig
this
normal
round
form
is
especially
found
in
cells
of
the
simplest
construction
and
those
that
are
developed
in
a
free
fluid
without
any
external
pressure
in
such
cases
the
nucleus
also
is
not
infrequently
round
and
located
in
the
centre
of
the
fig
in
other
cases
the
cells
have
no
definite
shape
they
are
constantly
changing
their
form
owing
to
their
automatic
movements
this
is
the
case
with
the
amœbæ
fig
and
and
the
amœboid
travelling
cells
fig
and
also
with
very
young
ova
fig
as
a
rule
the
cell
assumes
a
definite
form
in
the
course
of
its
career
in
the
tissues
of
the
multicellular
organism
in
which
a
number
of
similar
cells
are
bound
together
in
virtue
of
certain
laws
of
heredity
the
shape
is
determined
partly
by
the
form
of
their
connection
and
partly
by
their
special
functions
thus
for
instance
we
find
in
the
mucous
lining
of
our
tongue
very
thin
and
delicate
flat
cells
of
roundish
shape
fig
in
the
outer
skin

find
similar
but
harder

in
the
liver
and
other
glands

are
thicker
and
softer

developed

are
joined
together
by

of
interlacing
processes

also

of

teeth

in
other
forms

differ
very
much
in

great

of

are

the

can
be

kinds
of

among

as

the
largest

are
the
ova
as
for
instance
the
yellow
in
the
egg
which
we
shall
describe
later
fig
cells
also
vary
considerably
in
structure
in
this
connection
we
must
first
distinguish
between
the
active
and
passive
components
of
the
cell
it
is
only
the
former
or
parts
of
the
cell
that
really
live
and
effect
that
marvellous
world
of
phenomena
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
the
first
of
these
is
the
inner
nucleus
and
the
second
the
body
of
the
cell
the
portions
come
third
these
are
subsequently
formed
from
the
others
and
i
have
given
them
the
name
of
they
are
partly
external
and
intercellular
matter
and
partly
internal
and
the
nucleus
or
caryon
which
is
usually
of
a
simple
roundish
form
is
quite
structureless
at
first
especially
in
very
young
cells
and
composed
of
homogeneous
nuclear
matter
or
caryoplasm
fig
but
as
a
rule
it
forms
a
sort
of
vesicle
later
on
in
which
we
can
distinguish
a
more
solid
base
caryobasis
and
a
softer
or
fluid
sap
caryolymph
in
a
mesh
of
the
nuclear
network
or
it
may
be
on
the
inner
side
of
the
nuclear
envelope
there
is
as
a
rule
a
dark
very
opaque
solid
body
called
the
many
of
the
nuclei
contain
several
of
these
nucleoli
as
for
instance
the
germinal
vesicle
of
the
ova
of
fishes
and
amphibia
recently
a
very
small
but
particularly
important
part
of
the
nucleus
has
been
distinguished
as
the
centrosoma
tiny
particle
that
is
originally
found
in
the
nucleus
itself
but
is
usually
outside
it
in
the
cytoplasm
as
a
rule
fine
threads
stream
out
from
it
in
the
cytoplasm
from
the
position
of
the
central

any

even
in

we
must
infer
from
its

that
its
protoplasmic

has
a
very
complicated
chemical

and
a
fine
molecular
structure
which
escapes
our
observation
this
presumed
molecular
structure
of
the

is
now
generally
admitted

it
has
never
been

indeed
lies
far

vision

but
when
we
speak
of
the
cells
as
the
elementary
organisms
or
structural
units
or
individualities
we
must
bear
in
mind
a
certain
restriction
of
the
phrases
i
mean
that
the
cells
are
not
as
is
often
supposed
the
very
lowest
stage
of
organic
individuality
there
are
yet
more
elementary
organisms
to
which
i
must
refer
occasionally
these
are
what
we
call
the

living
independent

only
of
a
particle
of
albuminoid

is

quite

we
must
say
the
elementary
organism

the
ultimate
individual
is
found
in
two
different
stages
the
first

lower
stage
is
the
cytode

consists
merely
of
a
particle
of
plasson

quite
simple

second

higher
stage

is
already
divided

matter

comprise
both
cytodes

because
they
are
the
real
builders
of
the
organism

these
cytodes
are
not
found
as
a
rule
in
the
higher
animals

plants
here
we
have
only
real
cells
with
a
nucleus

in
these
organisms
both
plant
and
animal
the
organic
unit
always
consists
of
two
chemically
and
anatomically
different
outer
and
the
inner

to
convince
oneself
that
this
cell
is
really
an
independent
organism

have
only
to
observe
the
development

a
striking
resemblance
of
their

great

to
seem
to
be

a
strong

takes
up

this
into

examine
a
very
young

find
it
to
be

as
in

a

we
may
leave
them
out
of

altogether
here

restrict

substantial

of

now
let
us
for
the
first
time
make
use
of
our
biogenetic
law
and
directly
apply
this
fundamental
law
of
evolution
to
the
human
ovum
we
reach
a
very
simple
but
very
important
conclusion
fact
that
the
human
ovum
and
that
of
all
other
animals
consists
of
a
single
cell
it
follows
immediately
according
to
the
biogenetic
law
that
all
the
animals
including
man
descend
from
a
unicellular
if
our
biogenetic
law
is
true
if
the
embryonic
development
is
a
summary
or
condensed
recapitulation
of
the
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
are
bound
to
conclude
from
the
fact
that
all
the
ova
are
at
first
simple
cells
that
all
the
multicellular
organisms
originally
sprang
from
a
unicellular
being
and
as
the
original
ovum
in
man
and
all
the
other
animals
has
the
same
simple
and
indefinite
appearance
we
may
assume
with
some
probability
that
this
unicellular
was
the
common
ancestor
of
the
whole
animal
world
including
man
however
this
last
hypothesis
does
not
seem
to
me
as
inevitable
and
as
absolutely
certain
as
our
first
conclusion
a
fertilised
ovum
from
the
oviduct
of
a
hen
fig
fertilised
ovum

the

from
that
point
the
white

penetrates
to
the
central
the
two
kinds
of
yelk
do
not
differ
very
much
this
inference
from
the
unicellular
embryonic
form
to
the
unicellular
ancestor
is
so
simple
but
so
important
that
we
can
not
sufficiently
emphasise
it
we
must
therefore
turn
next
to
the
question
whether
there
are
any
unicellular
organisms
from
the
features
of
which
we
may
draw
some
approximate
conclusion
as
to
the
unicellular
ancestors
of
the
multicellular
organisms
the
answer
is
most
certainly
there
are
there
are
assuredly
still
unicellular
organisms
which
are
in
their
whole
nature
really
nothing
more
than
permanent
ova
there
are
independent
unicellular
organisms
of
the
simplest
character
which
develop
no
further
but
reproduce
themselves
as
such
without
any
further
growth
we
know
of
a
great
number
of
these
little
beings
such
as
the
gregarinæ
flagellata
acineta
infusoria
etc
however
there
is
one
of
them
that
has
an
especial
interest
for
us
because
it
at
once
suggests
itself
when
we
raise
our
question
and
it
must
be
regarded
as
the
unicellular
being
that
approaches
nearest
to
the
real
ancestral
form
this
organism
is
the
a
creeping

a
long

we
have
comprised
under
the
general
name
of
amœbæ
a
number
of
microscopic
unicellular
organisms
which
are
very
widely
distributed
especially
in
but
also
in
the
ocean
in
fact
they
have
lately
been
discovered
in
damp

there
are
also
parasitic
amœbæ
which
live
inside
other
animals

we
place
one
of
these
amœbæ
in
a

of
water
under
the
microscope

examine
it

a
high
power

generally

very
irregular

unicellular
body
moves
about
continually
creeping
in
every
direction
on
the
glass

which
we
are
examining

the
movement
is
effected
by
the
shapeless
body

out
processes
at
various
parts
of
its
surface

these
are
slowly

continually

feet

this
is
done
by

the

divides
into
two
parts
then
the
protoplasm
is
separated

the

splits

about

at

we
have
the
simple
form
of
direct
cleavage
of
the
nuclei
without
mitosis
or
formation
of

the
homogeneous
nucleus
divides
into
two
halves
these
move
away
from
each
other

become
centres
of
attraction

the
enveloping

the
same
direct
cleavage
of
the
nuclei
is
also
witnessed
in
the
reproduction
of
many
other
protists
while
other
unicellular
organisms
show
the
indirect
division
of
the
cell
hence
although
the
amœba
is
nothing
but
a
simple
cell
it
is
evidently
able
to
accomplish
all
the
functions
of
the
multicellular

kinds
of
these
amœbæ

be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
but
most
of
them
are
microscopically
small
it
is
for
the
following
reasons
that
we
regard
the
amœbæ
as
the
unicellular
organisms
which
have
special
phylogenetic
or
evolutionary
relations
to
the
ovum
in
many
of
the
lower
animals
the
ovum
retains
its
original
naked
form
until
fertilisation
develops
no
membranes
and
is
then
often
indistinguishable
from
the
ordinary
amœba
like
the
amœbæ
these
naked
ova
may
thrust
out
processes
and
move
about
as
travelling
cells
in
the
sponges
these
mobile
ova
move
about
freely

the
maternal
body
like
independent
amœbæ
fig
they
had
been
observed
by
earlier
scientists
but
described
as
foreign
parasitic
amœbæ
living
parasitically
on
the
body
of
the
sponge
later
however
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
not
parasites
but
the
ova
of
the
sponge
we
also
find
this
remarkable
phenomenon
among
other
animals
such
as
the
graceful
zoophytes
which
we
call
polyps
and
medusæ
their
ova
remain
naked
cells
which
thrust
out
amœboid
projections
nourish
themselves
and
move
about
when
they
have
been
fertilised
the
multicellular
organism
is
formed
from
them
by
repeated
segmentation
it
is
therefore
no
audacious
hypothesis
but
a
perfectly
sound
conclusion
to
regard
the
amœba
as
the
particular
unicellular
organism
which
offers
us
an
approximate
illustration
of
the
ancient
common
unicellular
ancestor
of
all
the
metazoa
or
multicellular
animals
the
simple
naked
amœba
has
a
less
definite
and
more
original
character
than
any
other
cell
moreover
there
is
the
fact
that
recent
research
has
discovered
such
cells
everywhere
in
the
mature
body
of
the
multicellular
animals
they
are
found
for
instance
in
the
human
blood
side
by
side
with
the
red
corpuscles
as
colourless
and
it
is
the
same
with
all
the
vertebrates
they
are
also
found
in
many
of
the
instance

the
blood
of
the
snail

showed
in
that
these
colourless
can
like
the
independent
amœbæ
take
up
solid
particles
or
whence
they
are
called
fig
lately
it
has
been
discovered
that
many
different
cells
may
if
they
have
room
enough
execute
the
same
movements
creeping
about
and
eating
they
behave
just
like
amœbæ
fig
it
has
also
been
shown
that
these
or
play
an
important
part
in
physiology
and
pathology
as
means
of
transport
for
food
infectious
matter
bacteria
the
power
of
the
naked
cell
to
execute
these
characteristic
movements
comes
from
the
contractility
or
automatic
mobility
of
its
protoplasm
this
seems
to
be
a
universal
property
of
young
cells
when
they
are
not
enclosed
by
a
firm
membrane
or
confined
in
a
prison
they
can
always
accomplish
these
amœboid

is

but
as
i
observed
in
my
essay
the
origin
and
ancestral
tree
of
the
human
in
this
offended
piety
must
equally
protest
against
the
and
fact
that
each
human
individual
is
developed
from
a
simple
ovum
and
that
this
human
ovum
is
indistinguishable
from
those
of
the
other
mammals
and
in
its
earliest
stage
is
like
a
naked
amœba
we
can
show
this
to
be
a
fact
any
day
with
the
microscope
and
it
is
little
use
to
close
eyes
to
facts
of
this
kind
it
is
as
indisputable
as
the
momentous
conclusions
we
draw
from
it
and

that

from
a
naked

i
was
the
first
to
observe
in
the
of
this
snail
the
important
fact
that
of
the
invertebrates
are
unprotected
pieces
of
plasm
and
take
in
food
by
means
of
their
peculiar
movements
like
the
i
had
in
naples
on
may
injected
into
the
of
one
of
these
snails
an
infusion
of
water
and
ground
indigo
and
was
greatly
astonished
to
find
the
themselves
more
or
less
filled
with
the
particles
of
indigo
after
a
few
hours
after
repeated
injections
i
succeeded
in
the
very
entrance
of
the
coloured
particles
in
the
which
took
place
just
in
the
same
way
as
with
the
i
have
given
further
particulars
about
this
in
my
on
the
we
now
see
very
clearly
how
extremely
important
the
cell
theory
has
been
for
our
whole
conception
of
organic
nature
place
in
is
settled
beyond
question
by
it
apart
from
the
cell
theory
man
is
an
insoluble
enigma
to
us
hence
philosophers
and
especially
physiologists
should
be
thoroughly
conversant
with
it
the
soul
of
man
can
only
be
really
understood
in
the
light
of
the
and
we
have
the
simplest
form
of
this
in
the
amœba
only
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
simple
psychic
functions
of
the
unicellular
organisms
and
their
gradual
evolution
in
the
series
of
lower
animals
can
understand
how
the
elaborate
mind
of
the
higher
vertebrates
and
especially
of
man
was
gradually
evolved
from
them
the
academic
psychologists
who
lack
this
zoological
equipment
are
unable
to
do
so
this
naturalistic
and
realistic
conception
is
a
to
our
modern
idealistic
metaphysicians
and
their
theological
colleagues
fenced
about
with
their
transcendental
and
dualistic
prejudices
they
attack
not
only
the
monistic
system
we
establish
on
our
scientific
knowledge
but
even
the
plainest
facts
which
go
to
form
its
foundation
an
instructive
instance
of
this
was
seen
a
few
years
ago
in
the
academic
discourse
delivered
by
a
distinguished
theologian
willibald
beyschlag
at
halle
january
on
the
occasion
of
the
centenary
festival
the
theologian
protested
violently
against
the
dustmen
of
the
scientific
world
who
offer
our
people
the
diploma
of
a
descent
from
the
ape
and
would
prove
to
them
that
the
genius
of
a
shakespeare
or
a
goethe
is
merely
a
distillation
from
a
drop
of
primitive
another
theologian
protested
against
horrible
idea
that
the
greatest
of
men
luther
and
christ
were
descended
from
a
mere
globule
of
nevertheless
not
a
single
informed
and
impartial
scientist
doubts
the
fact
that
these
greatest
men
were
like
all
other
all
other
from
an
impregnated
ovum
and
that
this
simple
nucleated
globule
of
protoplasm
has
the
same
chemical
constitution
in
all
the
mammals
chapter
vii
conception
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
every
man
begins
his
individual
existence
as
a
simple
cell
is
the
solid
foundation
of
all
research
into
the
genesis
of
man
from
this
fact
we
are
forced
in
virtue
of
our
biogenetic
law
to
draw
the
weighty
phylogenetic
conclusion
that
the
earliest
ancestors
of
the
human
race
were
also
unicellular
organisms
and
among
these
protozoa
we
may
single
out
the
vague
form
of
the
amœba
as
particularly
important
cf
chapter
vi
that
these
unicellular
ancestral
forms
did
once
exist
follows
directly
from
the
phenomena
which
we
perceive
every
day
in
the
fertilised
ovum
the
development
of
the
multicellular
organism
from
the
ovum
and
the
formation
of
the
germinal
layers
and
the
tissues
follow
the
same
laws
in
man
and
all
the
higher
animals
it
will
therefore
be
our
next
task
to
consider
more
closely
the
impregnated
ovum
and
the
process
of
conception
which
produces
it
the
process
of
impregnation
or
sexual
conception
is
one
of
those
phenomena
that
people
love
to
conceal
behind
the
mystic
veil
of
supernatural
power
we
shall
soon
see
however
that
it
is
a
purely
mechanical
process
and
can
be
reduced
to
familiar
physiological
functions
moreover
this
process
of
conception
is
of
the
same
type
and
is
effected
by
the
same
organs
in
man
as
in
all
the
other
mammals
the
pairing
of
the
male
and
female
has
in
both
cases
for
its
main
purpose
the
introduction
of
the
ripe
matter
of
the
male
seed
or
sperm
into
the
female
body
in
the
sexual
canals
of
which
it
encounters
the
ovum
conception
then
ensues
by
the
blending
of
the
two
we
must
observe
first
that
this
important
process
is
by
no
means
so
widely
distributed
in
the
animal
and
plant
world
as
is
commonly
supposed
there
is
a
very
large
number
of
lower
organisms
which
propagate
unsexually
or
by
monogamy
these
are
especially
the
sexless
monera
chromacea
bacteria
etc
but
also
many
other
protists
such
as
the
amœbæ
foraminifera
radiolaria
myxomycetæ
etc
in
these
the
multiplication
of
individuals
takes
place
by
unsexual
reproduction
which
takes
the
form
of
cleavage
budding
or
the
copulation
of
two
coalescing
cells
which
in
these
cases
often
precedes
the
reproduction
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
sexual
act
unless
the
two
copulating
plastids
differ
in
size
or
structure
on
the
other
hand
sexual
reproduction
is
the
general
rule
with
all
the
higher
organisms
both
animal
and
plant
very
rarely
do
we
find
asexual
reproduction
among
them
there
are
in
particular
no
cases
of
parthenogenesis
virginal
conception
among
the
vertebrates
sexual
reproduction
offers
an
infinite
variety
of
interesting
forms
in
the
different
classes
of
animals
and
plants
especially
as
regards
the
mode
of
conception
and
the
conveyance
of
the
spermatozoon
to
the
ovum
these
features
are
of
great
importance
not
only
as
regards
conception
itself
but
for
the
development
of
the
organic
form
and
especially
for
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
there
is
a
particularly
curious
correlation
of
plants
and
animals
in
this
respect
the
splendid
studies
of
charles
darwin
and
hermann
müller
on
the
fertilisation
of
flowers
by
insects
have
given
us
very
interesting
particulars
of
this
this
reciprocal
service
has
given
rise
to
a
most
intricate
sexual
apparatus
equally
elaborate
structures
have
been
developed
in
man
and
the
higher
animals
serving
partly
for
the
isolation
of
the
sexual
products
on
each
side
partly
for
bringing
them
together
in
conception
but
however
interesting
these
phenomena
are
in
themselves
we
can
not
go
into
them
here
as
they
have
only
a
minor
any
at
the
real
process
of
conception
we
must
however
try
to
get
a
very
clear
idea
of
this
process
and
the
meaning
of
sexual
reproduction
see
work
the
various
contrivances
by
which
orchids
are
in
every
act
of
conception
we
have
as
i
said
to
consider
two
different
kinds
of
female
and
a
male
cell
the
female
cell
of
the
animal
organism
is
always
called
the
ovum
or
egg
or
the
male
cells
are
known
as
the
sperm
or
or
the
spermatozoa
also
spermium
and
zoospermium
the
ripe
ovum
is
on
the
whole
one
of
the
largest
cells
we
know
it
attains
colossal
dimensions
when
it
absorbs
great
quantities
of
nutritive
yelk
as
is
the
case
with
birds
and
reptiles
and
many
of
the
fishes
in
the
great
majority
of
the
animals
the
ripe
ovum
is
rich
in
yelk
and
much
larger
than
the
other
cells
on
the
other
hand
the
next
cell
which
we
have
to
consider
in
the
process
of
conception
the
male
or
spermatozoon
is
one
of
the
smallest
cells
in
the
animal
body
conception
usually
consists
in
the
bringing
into
contact
with
the
ovum
of
a
slimy
fluid
secreted
by
the
male
and
this
may
take
place
either
inside
or
out
of
the
female
body
this
fluid
is
called
sperm
or
the
male
seed
sperm
like
saliva
or
blood
is
not
a
simple
fluid
but
a
thick
agglomeration
of
innumerable
cells
swimming
about
in
a
comparatively
small
quantity
of
fluid
it
is
not
the
fluid
but
the
independent

swim

features
firstly
they

cells
in

body
and
secondly
they
have
as
a
rule
a
peculiarly
lively
motion
which
is
known
as
spermatozoic
motion
the
shape
of
the

has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
motion
in
most
of
the
animals
and
also
in
many
of
the
lower
plants

not
the
higher

of
these
spermatozoa

very
small

hanging

it
was
long
before
we
could
recognise
that
these
structures
are
simple

they
were
formerly
held
to
be
special
organisms
and
were
called
or
they
are
now
scientifically
known
as
or
or
as
or
seed
threads
it
took
a
good
deal
of
comparative
research
to
convince
us
that
each
of
these
spermatozoa
is
really
a
simple
cell
they
have
the
same
shape
as
in
many
other
vertebrates

most

however
in

already

me

have
seen
that
this
is

unripe

transparent
round

this
germinal
vesicle
contains
a
viscous
fluid
the

firm
nuclear
frame

formed
of
the
enveloping
membrane
and
a
of
nuclear
threads
running
across

is
filled

nuclear

stiff

is
distributed

a
small
portion
of
the
nuclear

is
extruded
another
small

is
left
and
is
converted
into
the
secondary
nucleus
or
the
female
fig
the
small
portion
of
the
nuclear
base
which
is
extruded
from
the
impregnated
ovum
is
known
as
the
or
there
are
many
disputes
as
to
their
origin
and
significance
but
we
are
as
yet
imperfectly
acquainted
with
them
as
a
rule
they
are
two
small
round
granules
of
the
same
size
and
appearance
as
the
remaining
they
are
detached
their
separation
from
the
large
takes
place
in
the
same
way
as
in
ordinary
hence
the
polar
cells
are
probably
to
be
conceived
as
ova
or
ova
which
proceed
from
a
simple
original
ovum
by
cleavage
in
the
same
way
that
several
arise
from
one
in
reproduction
from
sperm
the
male
in
the
testicles
must
undergo
similar
changes
in
view
of
the
coming
impregnation
as
the
ova
in
the
female
ovary
in
this
maturing
of
the
sperm
each
of
the
original
divides
by
double
segmentation
into
four
each
furnished
with
a
fourth
of
the
original
nuclear
matter
the
hereditary
chromatin
and
each
of
these
four
descendant
cells
becomes
a
spermatozoon
ready
for
impregnation
thus
is
prevented
the
doubling
of
the
chromatin
in
the
coalescence
of
the
two
nuclei
at
conception
as
the
two
polar
cells
are
extruded
and
lost
and
have
no
further
part
in
the
fertilisation
of
the
ovum
we
need
not
discuss
them
any
further
but
we
must
give
more
attention
to
the
female
which
alone
remains
after
the
extrusion
of
the
polar
cells
and
the
dissolving
of
the
germinal
vesicle
fig
this
tiny
round
corpuscle
of
chromatin
now
acts
as
a
centre
of
attraction
for
the
invading
spermatozoon
in
the
large
ripe
ovum

coalesces
with
its

the
product
of
this
blending
which
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
act
of
impregnation
is
the
or
the
first
segmentation
nucleus
is
to
say
the
nucleus
of
the
embryonic
or
segmentation
this
is
the
starting
point
of
the
subsequent
embryonic
processes
hertwig
has
shown
that
the
tiny
transparent
ova
of
the
echinoderms
are
the
most
convenient
for
following
the
details
of
this
important
process
of
impregnation
we
can
in
this
case
easily
and
successfully
accomplish
artificial
impregnation
and
follow
the
formation
of
the
step
by
step
within
the
space
of
ten
minutes
if
we
put
ripe
ova
of
the
or
in
a
watch
glass
with
and
add
a
drop
of
ripe
we
find
each
ovum
impregnated
within
five
minutes
thousands
of
the
fine
mobile
ciliated
cells
which
we
have
described
as
fig
make
their
way
to
the
ova
owing
to
a
sort
of
chemical
sensitive
action
which
may
be
called
but
only
one
of
these
innumerable
spermatozoa
is
the
one
that
first
reaches
the
ovum
by
the
serpentine
motions
of
its
tail
and
touches
the
ovum
with
its
head
at
the
spot
where
the
point
of
its
head
touches
the
surface
of
the
ovum
the
protoplasm
of
the
latter
is
raised
in
the
form
of
a
small
wart
the
fig
the
spermatozoon
then
bores
its
way
into
this
with
its
head
the
tail
outside
wriggling
about
all
the
time
fig
presently
the
tail
also
disappears
within
the
ovum
at
the
same
time
the
ovum
secretes
a
thin
external
fig
starting
from
the
point
of
impregnation
and
this
prevents
any
more
spermatozoa
from
entering
an
impregnated
echinoderm
ovum
fig
impregnated
echinoderm
ovum
with
small
homogeneous
nucleus
from
inside
the
impregnated
ovum
we
now
see
a
rapid
series
of
most
important
changes
the
head
of
the
or
the
of
the
spermatozoon
grows
larger
and
rounder
and
is
converted
into
the
male
fig
this
has
an
attractive
influence
on
the
fine
granules
or
particles
which
are
distributed
in
the
protoplasm
of
the
ovum
they
arrange
themselves
in
lines
in
the
figure
of
a
star
but
the
attraction
or
the
between
the
two
nuclei
is
even
stronger
they
move
towards
each
other
inside
the
yelk
with
increasing
speed
the
male
fig
going
more
quickly
than
the
female
nucleus
the
tiny
male
nucleus
takes
with
it
the
radiating
mantle
which
spreads
like
a
star

it
at
last
the
two
sexual
nuclei

is
formed
from
this
combination
of
the
nuclei
is

of
the
impregnation

numerous

hence
the
one
essential
point
in
the
process
of
sexual
reproduction

impregnation
is
the
formation
of
a
new
cell
the
by
the
combination
of
two
originally
different
cells
the
female
ovum
and
the
male
spermatozoon
this
process
is
of
the
highest
importance
and
merits
our
closest
attention
all
that
happens
in
the
later
development
of
this
first
cell
and
in
the
life
of
the
organism
that
comes
of
it
is
determined
from
the
first
by
the
chemical
and
morphological
composition
of
the
its
nucleus
and
its
body
we
must
therefore
make
a
very
careful
study
of
the
rise
and
structure
of
the
the
first
question
that
arises
is
as
to
the
two
different
active
elements
the
nucleus
and
the
protoplasm
in
the
actual
coalescence
it
is
obvious
that
the
nucleus
plays
the
more
important
part
in
this
hence
hertwig
puts
his
theory
of
conception
in
the
principle
consists
in
the
copulation
of
two
which
come
from
a
male
and
a
female
and
as
the
phenomenon
of
heredity
is
inseparably
connected
with
the
reproductive
process
we
may
further
conclude
that
these
two
copulating
nuclei
the
characteristics
which
are
transmitted
from
parents
to
in
this
sense
i
had
in
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
ascribed
to
the
reproductive
nucleus
the
function
of
generation
and
and
to
the
nutritive
protoplasm
the
duties
of
nutrition
and
as
moreover
there
is
a
complete
coalescence
of
the
mutually
attracted
nuclear
substances
in
conception
and
the
new
nucleus
formed
the
is
the
real
for
the
development
of
the
fresh
organism
the
further
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
the
male
nucleus
conveys
to
the
child
the
qualities
of
the
father
and
the
female
nucleus
the
features
of
the
mother
we
must
not
forget
however
that
the
protoplasmic
bodies
of
the
copulating
cells
also
fuse
together
in
the
act
of
impregnation
the
of
the
invading
spermatozoon
the
trunk
and
tail
of
the
male
ciliated
cell
is
dissolved
in
the
yelk
of
the
female
ovum
this
coalescence
is
not
so
important
as
that
of
the
nuclei
but
it
must
not
be
overlooked
and
though
this
process
is
not
so
well
known
to
us
we
see
clearly
at
least
the
formation
of
the
figure
the
radial
arrangement
of
the
particles
in
the
plasma
in
it
figs
the
older
theories
of
impregnation
generally
went
astray
in
regarding
the
large
ovum
as
the
sole
base
of
the
new
organism
and
only
ascribed
to
the
spermatozoon
the
work
of
stimulating
and
originating
its
development
the
stimulus
which
it
gave
to
the
ovum
was
sometimes
thought
to
be
purely
chemical
at
other
times
rather
physical
on
the
principle
of
transferred
movement
or
again
a
mystic
and
transcendental
process
this
error
was
partly
due
to
the
imperfect
knowledge
at
that
time
of
the
facts
of
impregnation
and
partly
to
the
striking
difference
in
the
sizes
of
the
two
sexual
cells
most
of
the
earlier
observers
thought
that
the
spermatozoon
did
not
penetrate
into
the
ovum
and
even
when
this
had
been
demonstrated
the
spermatozoon
was
believed
to
disappear
in
the
ovum
without
leaving
a
trace
however
the
splendid
research
made
in
the
last
three
decades
with
the
finer
technical
methods
of
our
time
has
completely
exposed
the
error
of
this
it
has
been
shown
that
the
tiny
is
subordinated
to
but
coordinated
with
the
large
ovum
the
nuclei
of
the
two
cells
as
the
vehicles
of
the
hereditary
features
of
the
parents
are
of
equal
physiological
importance
in
some
cases
we
have
succeeded
in
proving
that
the
mass
of
the
active
nuclear
substance
which
combines
in
the
copulation
of
the
two
sexual
nuclei
is
originally
the
same
for
both
these
morphological
facts
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
familiar
physiological
truth
that
the
child
inherits
from
both
parents
and
that
on
the
average
they
are
equally
distributed
i
say
the
average
because
it
is
well
known
that
a
child
may
have
a
greater
likeness
to
the
father
or
to
the
mother
that
goes
without
saying
as
far
as
the
primary
sexual
characters
the
sexual
glands
are
concerned
but
it
is
also
possible
that
the
determination
of
the
weighty
determination
whether
the
child
is
to
be
a
boy
or
a
on
a
slight
qualitative
or
quantitative

occasioned
the
erroneous
views
of
earlier
scientists
are
easily
explained

the
principle

inert
motionless
ovum

quantity

reduced
in

in
proportion
to
its
need
to
seek
the
ovum
and
bore
its
way
into
its
yelk
these
differences
are
very
conspicuous
in
the
higher
animals
but
they
are
much
less
in
the
lower
animals
in
those
protists
unicellular
plants
and
animals
which
have
the
first
rudiments
of
sexual
reproduction
the
two
copulating
cells
are
at
first
quite
equal
in
these
cases
the
act
of
impregnation
is
nothing
more
than
a
sudden
in
which
the
originally
simple
cell
doubles
its
volume
and
is
thus
prepared
for
reproduction
afterwards
slight
differences
are
seen
in
the
size
of
the
copulating
cells
though
the
smaller
ones
still
have
the
same
shape
as
the
larger
ones
it
is
only
when
the
difference
in
size
is
very
pronounced
that
a
notable
difference
in
shape
is
found
the
sprightly
changes
more
in
shape
and
the
ovum
in
size
quite
in
harmony
with
this
new
conception
of
the
of
the
two
gonads
or
the
equal
physiological
importance
of
the
male
and
female
and
their
equal
share
in
the
process
of
heredity
is
the
important
fact
established
by
hertwig
that
in
normal
impregnation
only
one
single
spermatozoon
copulates
with
one
ovum

which
is
raised

state

it
is
made

lowering
of
its
temperature

stupefied

more

then
witness
the

these
remarkable
facts
of
impregnation
are
also
of
the
greatest
interest
in
psychology
especially
as
regards
the
theory
of
the
which
i
consider
to
be
its
chief
foundation
the
phenomena
we
have
described
can
only
be
understood
and
explained
by
ascribing
a
certain
lower
degree
of
psychic
activity
to
the
sexual
principles
they
each
proximity
and
are
drawn
together
by
a
impulse
probably
related
to
smell
they
towards
each
other
and
do
not
rest
until
they
fuse
together
physiologists
may
say
that
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
peculiar
phenomenon
and
not
a
psychic
action
but
the
two
can
not
be
separated
even
the
psychic
functions
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
are
only
complex
physical
processes
or
phenomena
which
are
determined
in
all
cases
exclusively
by
the
chemical
composition
of
their
material
substratum
the
monistic
view
of
the
matter
becomes
clear
enough
when
we
remember
the
radical
importance
of
impregnation
as
regards
heredity
it
is
well
known
that
not
only
the
most
delicate
bodily
structures
but
also
the
subtlest
traits
of
mind
are
transmitted
from
the
parents
to
the
children
in
this
the
chromatic
matter
of
the
male
nucleus
is
just
as
important
a
vehicle
as
the
large
caryoplasmic
substance
of
the
female
nucleus
the
one
transmits
the
mental
features
of
the
father
and
the
other
those
of
the
mother
the
blending
of
the
two
parental
nuclei
determines
the
individual
psychic
character
of
the
child
but
there
is
another
important
psychological
most
important
of
has
been
definitely
answered
by
the
recent
discoveries
in
connection
with
conception
this
is
the
question
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
no
fact
throws
more
light
on
it
and
refutes
it
more
convincingly
than
the
elementary
process
of
conception
that
we
have
described
for
this
copulation
of
the
two
sexual
nuclei
figs
and
indicates
the
precise
moment
at
which
the
individual
begins
to
exist
all
the
bodily
and
mental
features
of
the
child
are
the
of
the
hereditary
qualities
which
it
has
received
in
reproduction
from
parents
and
ancestors
all
that
man
acquires
afterwards
in
life
by
the
exercise
of
his
organs
the
influence
of
his
environment
and
a
word
by
can
not
obliterate
that
general
outline
of
his
being
which
he
inherited
from
his
parents
but
this
hereditary
disposition
the
essence
of
every
human
soul
is
not
but
it
comes
into
being
only
at
the
moment
when
the
of
the
father
and
the
nucleus
of
the
maternal
ovum
meet
and
fuse
together
it
is
clearly
irrational
to
assume
an
life
without
for
an
individual
phenomenon
the
commencement
of
which
we
can
indicate
to
a
moment
by
direct
visual
observation
the
great
importance
of
the
process
of
impregnation
in
answering
such
questions
is
quite
clear
it
is
true
that
conception
has
never
been
studied
microscopically
in
all
its
details
in
the
human
its
occurrence
at
every
reasons
that
are
obvious
enough
however
the
two
cells
which
need
consideration
the
female
ovum
and
the
male
spermatozoon
proceed
in
the
case
of
man
in
just
the
same
way
as
in
all
the
other
mammals
the
human
fœtus
or
embryo
which
results
from
copulation
has
the
same
form
as
with
the
other
animals
hence
no
scientist
who
is
acquainted
with
the
facts
doubts
that
the
processes
of
impregnation
are
just
the
same
in
man
as
in
the
other
animals
the
which
is
produced
and
with
which
every
man
begins
his
career
can
not
be
distinguished
in
appearance
from
those
of
other
mammals
such
as
the
rabbit
fig
in
the
case
of
man
also
this
differs
materially
from
the
original
ovum
both
in
regard
to
form
morphologically
in
regard
to
material
composition
chemically
and
in
regard
to
vital
properties
physiologically
it
comes
partly
from
the
father
and
partly
from
the
mother
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
child
who
is
developed
from
it
inherits
from

parents
the
vital
movements
of
each
of

form
a
sum
of
mechanical
processes
which
in
the

analysis
are
due
to
movements
of
the

the
molecules
of
the

substance
if
we
agree
to
call
this
active

and
its

we
may
say
that
the
individual

character
of
each
of

due

from
the
anatomical
point
of

be
regarded

structureless

is
not
inconsistent
with
our
hypothetical
ascription
to
the

there
is
a
substantial
agreement
throughout
the
animal
world
in
the
first
changes
which
follow
the
impregnation
of
the

and
the
formation
of

begin
in
all
cases
with
the
segmentation
of
the

and
the

of
the

the
only
exception
is
found
in
the
protozoa
the
very
lowest
and
simplest
forms
of
animal
life
these
remain
unicellular
throughout
life
to
this
group
belong
the
amœbae
gregarinæ
rhizopods
infusoria
etc
as
their
whole
organism
consists
of
a
single
cell
they
can
never
form

or
definite
strata
of
cells
but
all
the
other
the
animals
or
as
we
call
them
in
contradistinction
to
the
real
germinal
layers
by
the
repeated
cleavage
of
the
impregnated
ovum
this
we
find
in
the
lower
cnidaria
and
worms
as
well
as
in
the
more
molluscs
echinoderms

and
vertebrates
in
all
these
metazoa
or
multicellular
animals
the
chief
embryonic
processes
are
substantially
alike
although
they
often
seem
to
a
superficial
observer
to
differ
considerably
the
that
proceeds
from
the
impregnated
ovum
always
passes
by
repeated
cleavage
into
a
number
of
simple
cells
these
cells
are
all
direct
descendants
of
the
and
are
for
reasons
we
shall
see
presently
called

repeated

of

which
gives
rise
to
these

long
been
known
as

or
later

together
to
form
a
round

different

the
important
embryonic
form
that
has
these
primitive
organs
and
the
name
of
to
the
formation
of
it
this
ontogenetic
process
has
a
very
great
significance
and
is
the
real
of
the
construction
of
the
multicellular
animal
body
the
fundamental
embryonic
processes
of
the
cleavage
of
the
ovum
and
the
formation
of
the
germinal
layers
have
been
very
thoroughly
studied
in
the
last
thirty
years
and
their
real
significance
has
been
appreciated
they
present
a
striking
variety
in
the
different
groups
and
it
was
no
light
task
to
prove
their
essential
identity
in
the
whole
animal
world
but
since
i
formulated
the
gastræa
theory
in
and
afterwards
reduced
all
the
various
forms
of
segmentation
and
gastrulation
to
one
fundamental
type
their
identity
may
be
said
to
have
been
established
we
have
thus
mastered
the
law
of
unity
which
governs
the
first
embryonic
processes
in
all
the
animals
man
is
like
all
the
other
higher
animals
especially
the
apes
in
regard
to
these
earliest
and
most
important
processes
as
the
human
embryo
does
not
essentially
differ
even
at
a
much
later
stage
of
we
already
perceive
the
cerebral
vesicles
the
eyes
ears
the
similar
forms
of
the
other
higher
mammals
we
may
confidently
assume
that
they
agree
in
the
earliest
embryonic
processes
segmentation
and
the
formation
of
germinal
layers
this
has
not
yet
it
is
true
been
established
by
observation
we
have
never
yet
had
occasion
to
dissect
a
woman
immediately
after
impregnation
and
examine
the
or
the
in
her
oviduct
however
as
the
earliest
human
embryos
we
have
examined
and
the
later
and
more
developed
forms
agree
with
those
of
the
rabbit
dog
and
other
higher
mammals
no
reasonable
man
will
doubt
but
that
the
segmentation
and
formation
of
layers
are
the
same
in
both
cases
but
the
special
form
of
segmentation
and
layer
formation
which
we
find
in
the
mammal
is
by
no
means
the
original
simple
palingenetic
form
it
has
been
much
modified
and
cenogenetically
altered
by
a
very
complex
adaptation
to
embryonic
conditions
we
can
not
therefore
understand
it
altogether
in
itself
in
order
to
do
this
we
have
to
make
a
study
of
segmentation
and
in
the
animal
world
and
we
have
especially
to
seek
the
original
form
from
which
the
modified
see
form
has
gradually
been
developed
this
original
unaltered
form
of
segmentation
and
is
found
in
only
one
case
in
the
to
which
man
lowest
and
oldest
member
of
the
stem
the
wonderful
lancelet
or
amphioxus
cf
chapters
xvi
and
xvii
but
we
find
a
precisely
similar
palingenetic
form
of
embryonic
development
in
the
case
of
many
of
the
invertebrate
animals
as
for
instance
the
remarkable
ascidia
the
and
and
many
of
the
echinoderms
and
cnidaria
such
as
the
common
and
many
of
the
medusæ
and
corals
and
the
simpler
sponges
we
may
take
as
an
illustration
the
palingenetic
segmentation
and
germinal
in
an
insular
coral
which
i
discovered
in
the
red
sea
and
described
as

repel
each
other

act
as
centres
of
attraction
on
the
surrounding
protoplasm
in
consequence
of
this
the
protoplasm
is
constricted
by
a
circular

in

divides

so
on

final
result
of

the

we
call

the
number
of
thus
produced
increases
geometrically
in
the
original
gastrulation

the
purest
palingenetic

however
in
different
animals
the
number
reaches
a
different

the

more

make

usually
to

similar

in

of
this
extraordinary
significance
of
the

we
must
make
a
very
careful
study
of
its
original
structure
as
a
rule
the
typical
gastrula
is
very
small
being
invisible
to
the
naked
eye

at
the
most
only
visible
as
a
fine

under
very
favourable
conditions
and
measuring
generally
to
of
an
inch
less
frequently
inch
or
even
more
in
diameter
in
shape
it
is
usually
like
a
roundish
sometimes
it
is
rather
oval
at
other
times
more
ellipsoid

in
some
cases
it
is
half
round

even
almost
round

almost

i
give
the
name
of
primitive
gut
and
primitive
mouth
to
the
internal
cavity
of
the
and
its
opening
because
this
cavity
is
the
first
rudiment
of
the
digestive
cavity
of
the
organism
and
the
opening
originally
served
to
take
food
into
it
naturally
the
primitive
gut
and
mouth
change
very
considerably
afterwards
in
the
various
classes
of
animals
in
most
of
the
cnidaria
and
many
of
the
annelids
animals
they
remain
unchanged
throughout
life

in
most
of
the
higher
animals
and
so
in
the
vertebrates
only
the
larger
central
part
of
the
later
alimentary
canal
develops
from
the
primitive
gut
the
later
mouth
is
a
fresh
development
the
primitive
mouth
disappearing
or
changing
into
the
anus
we
must
therefore
distinguish
carefully
between
the
primitive
gut
and
mouth
of
the
gastrula
and
the
later
alimentary
canal
and
mouth
of
the
fully
developed

my
distinction
between
the
primitive
gut
and
mouth
and
the
later
permanent
stomach
and
mouth
has
been
much
criticised
but
it
is
as
much
justified
as
the
distinction
between
the
primitive

and

for
many
and
weighty
reasons
we
may
regard
as
the
original

palingenetic
form
we
might
call
it

homogeneous

the
divided

retain
a

the
most
elaborate

in

development
from

traces
the

secondary

gastrulation

the
simple

this

as
distinguished
from
the
cenogenetic

of

may
on
the
whole
be
regarded
as
palingenetic
it
is
nevertheless
different
in
some
features
from
the
quite
primitive
gastrulation
such
as
we
have
for
instance
in
the
fig
and
the
hatschek
rightly
observes
that
the
segmentation
of
the
ovum
in
the
amphioxus
is
not
strictly
equal
but
almost
equal
and
approaches
the
unequal

in

between

to

more

already

thus
the

of

been
determined
this

been

from

of

typical
archigastrula
of
the
lower
animals
figs
in
developing
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
from
a
single
layer
of
cells
this
is
clearly
the
oldest
and
original
form
of
the
metazoic
embryo
although
the
animals
i
have
mentioned
belong
to
the
most
diverse
classes
they
nevertheless
agree
with
each
other
and
many
more
animal
forms
in
having
retained
to
the
present
day
by
a
conservative
heredity
this
palingenetic
form
of
gastrulation
which
they
have
from
their
earliest
common
ancestors
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
great
majority
of
the
animals
with
these
the
original
embryonic
process
has
been
gradually
more
or
less
altered
in
the
course
of
millions
of
years
by
adaptation
to
new
conditions
of
development
both
the
segmentation
of
the
ovum
and
the
subsequent
gastrulation
have
in
this
way
been
considerably
changed
in
fact
these
variations
have
become
so
great
in
the
course
of
time
that
the
segmentation
was
not
rightly
understood
in
most
animals
and
the
gastrula
was
unrecognised
it
was
not
until
i
had
made
an
extensive
comparative
study
lasting
a
considerable
time
in
the
years
in
animals
of
the
most
diverse
classes
that
i
succeeded
in
showing
the
same
common
typical
process
in
these
apparently
very
different
forms
of
gastrulation
and
tracing
them
all
to
one
original
form
i
regard
all
those
that
diverge
from
the
primary
palingenetic
gastrulation
as
secondary
modified
and
cenogenetic
the
more
or
less
divergent
form
of
gastrula
that
is
produced
may
be
called
a
secondary
modified
gastrula
or
a
the
reader
will
find
a
scheme
of
these
different
kinds
of
segmentation
and
gastrulation
at
the
close
of
this
chapter
by
far
the
most
important
process
that
determines
the
various
cenogenetic
forms
of
gastrulation
is
the
change
in
the
nutrition
of
the
ovum
and
the
accumulation
in
it
of
nutritive
yelk
by
this
we
understand
various
chemical
substances
chiefly
granules
of
albumin
and
which
serve
exclusively
as
or
food
for
the
embryo
as
the
metazoic
embryo
in
its
earlier
stages
of
development
is
not
yet
able
to
obtain
its
food
and
so
build
up
the
frame
the
necessary
material
has
to
be
stored
up
in
the
ovum
hence
we
distinguish
in
the
ova
two
chief
active
formative
yelk
protoplasm
and
the
passive
deutoplasm
wrongly
spoken
of
as
in
the
little
palingenetic
ova
the
segmentation
of
which
we
have
already
considered
the
are
so
small
and
so
regularly
distributed
in
the
protoplasm
of
the
ovum
that
the
even
and
repeated
cleavage
is
not
affected
by
them
but
in
the
great
majority
of
the
animal
ova
the
is
more
or
less
considerable
and
is
stored
in
a
certain
part
of
the
ovum
so
that
even
in
the
unfertilised
ovum
the
can
clearly
be
distinguished
from
the

the
gastrulation
then
usually
takes
place
in
such
a
way
that
in
the
cleavage
of
the
impregnated
ovum
the
animal
usually
the
upper
half
splits
up
more
quickly
than
the
vegetal
lower
the
contractions
of
the
active
protoplasm
which
effect
this
continual
cleavage
of
the
cells
meet
a
greater
resistance
in
the
lower
vegetal
half
from
the
passive
deutoplasm
than
in
the
upper

half

we
find
in
the
latter
more
but
smaller
and
in
the
former
fewer
but
larger

the
animal
cells
produce
the

the

internal

this
unequal
segmentation
of
the
cyclostoma
ganoids
and
amphibia
seems
at
first
sight
to
differ
from
the
original
equal
segmentation
for
instance
in
the
monoxenia

they
both
have
this
in
common
that
the
cleavage
process
throughout
affects
the

it
is
otherwise

second
chief
group
of

he
distinguished
from
these
as

to
this
class
belong
the
familiar
large
eggs
of
birds
and
reptiles
and
of
most
fishes
the
inert
mass
of
the
passive
is
so
large
in
these
cases
that
the
protoplasmic
contractions
of
the
active
yelk
can
not
effect
any
further
cleavage
in
consequence
there
is
only
a
partial
segmentation
while
the
protoplasm
in
the
animal
section
of
the
ovum
continues
briskly
to
divide
multiplying
the
nuclei
the
deutoplasm
in
the
vegetal
section
remains
more
or

undivided
it
is
merely
consumed
as
food

the
forming

accumulation
of

the
more
restricted
is
the
process
of
segmentation
it
may
however
continue
for
some
time
even
after
the
gastrulation
is
more
or
less
complete
in
the
sense
that
the
vegetal
distributed
in
the
deutoplasm
slowly
increase
by
cleavage
as
each
of
them
is
surrounded
by
a
small
quantity
of
protoplasm
it
may
afterwards
appropriate
a
portion
of
the
and
thus
form
a
real

this
vegetal
continues
for
a
long
time
after
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
have
been
formed

takes

name

the
meroblastic

only
found
in
the
larger
and
more
highly
developed
animals
and
only
in
those
whose

needs
a
longer
time
and
richer
nourishment
within
the
fœtal
membranes
according
as
the
accumulates
at
the
centre
or
at
the
side
of
the
ovum
we
distinguish
two
groups
of
dividing
ova
periblastic
and
discoblastic

the
periblastic

in
the
centre
enclosed
inside
the
ovum
hence
they
are
also
called

formative
yelk

the
and
so
suffers
itself

cleavage

is
found
among

gathers

side

the
nucleus
of
the
ovum
and
the
great
bulk
of
the
formative
yelk
lie
at
the
upper
or
animal
pole
hence
these
ova
are
also
called
in
these
cases
the
cleavage
of
the
ovum
begins
at
the
upper
pole
and
leads
to
the
formation
of
a
dorsal
discoid
embryo
this
is
the
case
with
all
meroblastic
vertebrates
most
fishes
the
reptiles
and
birds
and
the
oviparous
mammals
the
monotremes
the
gastrulation
of
the
discoblastic
ova
which
chiefly
concerns
us
offers
serious
difficulties
to
microscopic
investigation
and
philosophic
consideration
these
however
have
been
mastered
by
the
comparative
embryological
research
which
has
been
conducted
by
a
number
of
distinguished
observers
during
the
last
few
the
brothers
hertwig

etc
these
thorough
and
careful
studies
aided
by
the
most
perfect
modern
improvements
in
technical
method
in
tinting
and
dissection
have
given
a
very
welcome
support
to
the
views
which
i
put
forward
in
my
work
the
gastrula
and
the
segmentation
of
the
animal
not
translated
in
as
it
is
very
important
to
understand
these
views
and
their
phylogenetic
foundation
clearly
not
only
as
regards
evolution
in
general
but
particularly
in
connection
with
the
genesis
of
man
i
will
give
here
a
brief
statement
of
them
as
far
as
they
concern
the
all
the
vertebrates
including
man
are
phylogenetically
or
genealogically
is
are
members
of
one
single
natural
stem
consequently
the
embryonic
features
in
their
individual
development
must
also
have
a
genetic
connection
as
the
gastrulation
of
the
amphioxus
shows
the
original
palingenetic
form
in
its
simplest
features
that
of
the
other
vertebrates
must
have
been
derived
from
it
the
cenogenetic
modifications
of
the
latter
are
more
appreciable
the
more
is
stored
up
in
the
ovum
although
the
mass
of
the
may
be
very
large
in
the
ova
of
the
discoblastic
vertebrates
nevertheless
in
every
case
a
blastula
is
developed
from
the
morula
as
in
the
holoblastic
ova
also
in
every
case
the
gastrula
develops
from
the
blastula
by
curving
or
invagination
the
cavity
which
is
produced
in
the
fœtus
by
this
curving
is
in
each
case

its
opening

primitive
mouth

whether
large
or
small
is
always
stored
in
the
ventral
wall
of
the
primitive
gut
the
cells
called
which
may
be
formed
in
it
subsequently
by
also
belong
to
the
inner
germinal
layer

the
cells
which
immediately
enclose

at

lies

vertical
axis

forced
by
the
growth
of
the
yelk
backwards
and
then
upwards
towards
the
dorsal
side
of
the
embryo
the
vertical
axis
of
the
primitive
gut
is
thus
gradually
converted
into
horizontal
the
primitive
mouth
is
closed
sooner
or
later

rather

the

region
of
the

from
this
important
point
the
formation
of
the
middle
germinal
layer
proceeds
between
the
two
primary
layers
the
wide
comparative
studies
of
the
scientists

have
named
have
further
shown
that
in
the
case
of
the
discoblastic
higher
vertebrates
the
three
classes
of
amniotes
the
primitive
mouth
of
the
embryonic
disc
which
was
long
looked
for
in
vain
is
found
always
and
is
nothing
else
than
the
familiar
of
this
we
shall
see
more
as
we
proceed
meantime
we
realise
that
gastrulation
may
be
reduced
to
one
and
the
same
process
in
all
the
vertebrates
moreover
the
various
forms
it
takes
in
the
invertebrates
can
always
be
reduced
to
one
of
the
four
types
of
segmentation
described
above
in
relation
to
the
distinction
between
total
and
partial
segmentation
the
grouping
of
the
various

is

at

of

which
differs
little
from
the
gastrula
their
whole
body
consists
of
two
layers
of
cells
this
is
a
fact
of
extreme
importance
we
see
that
man
and
also
other
vertebrates
pass
quickly
through
a
stage
of
development
in
which
they
consist
of
two
layers
just
as
these
lower
zoophyta
do
throughout
life
if
we
apply
our
biogenetic
law
to
the
matter
we
at
once
reach
this
important
conclusion
and
all
the
other
animals
which
pass
through
the
stage
or
in
the
course
of
their
embryonic
development
must
descend
from
a
primitive
simple
the
whole
body
of
which
consisted
throughout
life
as
is
the
case
with
the
lower
zoophyta
merely
of
two
or
germinal
we
will
call
this
primitive
with
which
we
shall
deal
more
fully
later
on
the
is
to
say
according
to
this
there
was
originally
in
all
the
multicellular
animals
with
the
same
structure
and
function
this
was
the
primitive
gut
and
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
which
form
its
wall
must
also
be
regarded
as
identical
in
all
this
important
homology
or
identity
of
the
primary
germinal
layers
is
proved
on
the
one
hand
from
the
fact
that
the
gastrula
was
originally
formed
in
the
same
way
in
all
by
the
curving
of
the
blastula
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
fact
that
in
every
case
the
same
fundamental
organs
arise
from
the
germinal
layers
the
outer
or
animal
layer
or
ectoderm
always
forms
the
chief
organs
of
animal
skin
nervous
system
etc
the
inner
or
vegetal
layer
or
entoderm
gives
rise
to
the
chief
organs
of
vegetative
organs
of
nourishment
digestion
etc
in
the
lower
zoophyta
whose
body
remains
at
the
stage
throughout
life
the
gastræads
the
simplest
sponges
and
polyps
these
two
groups
of
functions
animal
and
vegetative
are
strictly
divided
between
the
two
simple
primary
layers
throughout
life
the
outer
or
animal
layer
acts
simply
as
a
covering
for
the
body
and
accomplishes
its
movement
and
sensation
the
inner
or
vegetative
layer
of
cells
acts
throughout
life
as
a
or
nutritive
layer
of
enteric
cells
and
often
also
yields
the
reproductive
cells
the
best
known
of
these
or
animals
is
the
common
polyp
this
simplest
of
all
the
cnidaria

true
a
crown
of
tentacles
round
its
mouth
also
its
outer
germinal
layer
has
certain
special
modifications
but
these
are
secondary
additions
and
the
inner
germinal
layer
is
a
simple
stratum
of
cells

whole

theodore
development
of
the
the
remarkable
processes
of
gastrulation
and
formation
of
germinal
layers
present
a
most
conspicuous
variety
there
is
only
the
lowest
of
the
vertebrates
the
amphioxus
that
exhibits
the
original
form
of
those
processes
or
the
palingenetic
gastrulation
which
we
have
considered
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
which
culminates
in
the
formation
of
the
archigastrula
fig
in
all
other
extant
vertebrates
these
fundamental
processes
have
been
more
or
less
modified
by
adaptation
to
the
conditions
of
embryonic
development
especially
by
changes
in
the
they
exhibit
various
cenogenetic
types
of
the
formation
of
germinal
layers
however
the
different
classes
vary
considerably
from
each
other
in
order
to
grasp
the
unity
that
underlies
the
manifold
differences
in
these
phenomena
and
their
historical
connection
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
always
the
unity
of
the
this
unity
which
i
developed
in
my
in
is
now
generally
admitted
all
impartial
zoologists
agree
that
all
the
vertebrates
from
the
amphioxus
and
the
fishes
to
the
ape
and
man
descend
from
a
common
ancestor
primitive
hence
the
embryonic
processes
by
which
each
individual
vertebrate
is
developed
must
also
be
capable
of
being
reduced
to
one
common
type
of
embryonic
development
and
this
primitive
type
is
most
certainly
exhibited
by
the
amphioxus
it
must
therefore
be
our
next
task
to
make
a
comparative
study
of
the
various
forms
of
vertebrate
gastrulation
and
trace
them
backwards
to
that
of
the
lancelet
broadly
speaking
they
fall
first
into
two
groups
the
older
cyclostoma
the
earliest
fishes
most
of
the
amphibia
and
the
viviparous
mammals
have
is
to
say
ova
with
total
unequal
segmentation
while
the
younger
cyclostoma
most
of
the
fishes
the
cephalopods
reptiles
birds
and
monotremes
have
ova
or
ova
with
partial
discoid
segmentation
a
closer
study
of
them
shows
however
that
these
two
groups
do
not
present
a
natural
unity
and
that
the
historical
relations
between
their
several
divisions
are
very
complicated
in
order
to
understand
them
properly
we
must
first
consider
the
various
modifications
of
gastrulation
in
these
classes
we
may
begin
with
that
of
the
amphibia
the
most
suitable
and
most
available
objects
of
study
in
this
class
are
the
eggs
of
our
indigenous
amphibia
the
tailless
frogs
and
toads
and
the
tailed
salamander
in
spring
they
are
to
be
found
in
clusters
in
every
pond
and
careful
examination
of
the
ova
with
a
lens
is
sufficient
to
show
at
least
the
external
features
of
the
segmentation
in
order
to
understand
the
whole
process
rightly
and
follow
the
formation
of
the
germinal
layers
and
the
gastrula
the
ova
of
the
frog
and
salamander
must
be
carefully
hardened
then
the
thinnest
possible
sections
must
be
made
of
the
hardened
ova
with
the
microtome
and
the
tinted
sections
must
be
very
closely
compared
under
a
powerful
microscope
the
ova
of
the
frog
or
toad
are
globular
in
shape
about
the
twelfth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
are
clustered
in
masses
which
are
lumped
together
in
the
case
of
the
frog
but
form
long
strings
in
the
case
of
the
toad
when
we
examine
the
opaque
grey
brown
or
blackish
ova
closely
we
find
that
the
upper
half
is
darker
than
the
lower
the
middle
of
the
upper
half
is
in
many
species
black
while
the
middle
of
the
lower
half
is
white
in
this
way
we
get
a
definite
axis
of
the
ovum
with
two
poles
to
give
a
clear
idea
of
the
segmentation
of
this
ovum
it
is
best
to
compare
it
with
a
globe
on
the
surface
of
which
are
marked
the
various
parallels
of
longitude
and
latitude
the
superficial
dividing
lines
between
the
different
cells
which
come
from
the
repeated
segmentation
of
the
ovum
look
like
deep
furrows
on
the
surface
and
hence
the
whole
process
has
been
given
the
name
of
furcation
in
reality
however
this
which
was
formerly
regarded
as
a
very
mysterious
process
is
nothing
but
the
familiar
repeated
hence
also
the
which
result
from
it
are
real
cells
the
colouring
of
the
eggs
of
the
amphibia
is
caused
by
the
accumulation
of
matter
at
the
animal
pole
of
the
ovum
in
consequence
of
this
the
animal
cells
of
the
ectoderm
are
darker
than
the
vegetal
cells
of
the
entoderm
we
find
the
reverse
of
this
in
the
case
of
most
animals
the
protoplasm
of
the
entoderm
cells
being
usually
darker

the
unequal

which
we
observe
in
the
ovum
of
the
amphibia
has
the
special
feature
of
beginning
at
the
upper
and
darker
pole
the
north
pole
of
the
terrestrial
globe
in
our
illustration
and
slowly
advancing
towards
the
lower
and
brighter
pole
the
south
pole
also
the
upper
and
darker
hemisphere
remains
in
this
position
throughout
the
course
of
the
segmentation
and
its
cells
multiply
much
more
briskly
hence
the
cells
of
the
lower
hemisphere
are
found
to
be
larger
and
less
numerous
the
cleavage
of
the
fig
begins
with
the
formation
of
a
complete
furrow
which
starts
from
the
north
pole
and
reaches
to
the
south
an
hour
later
a
second
furrow
arises
in
the
same
way
and
this
cuts
the
first
at
a
right
angle
fig
the
ovum
is
thus
divided
into
four
equal
parts
each
of
these
four
has
an
upper
and
darker
and
a
lower
brighter

few

a

appears
vertically

the

the

four
smaller

above
northern

larger

below

next
each
of
the
four
upper
ones
divides
into
two
halves
by
a
cleavage
beginning
from
the
north
pole
so
that
we
now
have
eight
above
and
four
below
fig
later
the
four
new
longitudinal
divisions
extend
gradually
to
the
lower
cells
and
the
number
rises
from
twelve
to
sixteen
then
a
second
circular
furrow
appears
parallel
to
the
first
and
nearer
to
the
north
pole
so
that
we
may
compare
it
to
the
north
polar
circle
in
this
way
we
get
upper
smaller
and
darker
ones
and
eight
smaller
and
brighter
ones
below
soon
however
the
latter
also
into
sixteen
a
third
or
of
appearing
this
time
in
the
southern
hemisphere
this
makes
cells
altogether
then
eight
new
longitudinal
lines
are
formed
at
the
north
pole
and
these
proceed
to
divide
first
the
darker
cells
above
and
afterwards
the
lighter
southern
cells
and
finally
reach
the
south
pole
in
this
way
we
get
in
succession
forty
and
at
last
cells
in
the
meantime
the
two
hemispheres
differ
more
and
more
from
each
other
whereas
the
sluggish
lower
hemisphere
long
remains
at
cells
the
lively
northern
hemisphere
briskly
twice
producing
first
and
then
cells
thus
we
reach
a
stage
in
which
we
count
on
the
surface
of
the
ovum
small
cells
in
the
upper
half
and
large
ones
in
the
lower
half
or
altogether
the
dissimilarity
of
the
two
halves
increases
while
the
northern
breaks
up
into
a
great
number
of
small
cells
the
southern
consists
of
a
much
smaller
number
of
larger
cells
finally
the
dark
cells
of
the
upper
half
grow
almost
over
the
surface
of
the
ovum
leaving
only
a
small
circular
spot
at
the
south
pole

the
large
and

of

the

of
the

in
all
these
animals
the
mature
ovum
and
the
that
arises
from
it
in
fertilisation
consist
of
two
different
and
separate
parts
which
we
have
called
formative
yelk
and
nutritive
yelk
the
formative
yelk
alone
consists
of
living
protoplasm
and
is
the
active
evolutionary
and
nucleated
part
of
the
ovum
this
alone
divides
in
segmentation
and
produces
the
numerous
cells
which
make
up
the
embryo
on
the
other
hand
the
nutritive
yelk
is
merely
a
passive
part
of
the
contents
of
the
ovum
a
subordinate
element
which
contains
nutritive
material
albumin
fat
etc
and
so
represents
in
a
sense
the
of
the
developing
embryo
the
latter
takes
a
quantity
of
food
out
of
this
store
and
finally
consumes
it
all
hence
the
nutritive
yelk
is
of
great
indirect
importance
in
embryonic
development
though
it
has
no
direct
share
in
it
it
either
does
not
divide
at
all
or
only
later
on
and
does
not
generally
consist
of
cells
it
is
sometimes
large
and
sometimes
small
but
generally
many
times
larger
than
the
formative
yelk
and
hence
it
is
that
it
was
formerly
thought
the
more
important
of
the
two
as
the
respective
significance
of
these
two
parts
of
the
ovum
is
often
wrongly
described
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
nutritive
yelk
is
only
a
secondary
addition
to
the
primary
cell
it
is
an
inner
enclosure
not
an
external
appendage
all
ova
that
have
this
independent
nutritive
yelk
are

difficulties
in
the

this
partial

the
gastrula
that
arises
from
it
we
have
only
recently
succeeded
by

of
comparative
research
in
overcoming
these
difficulties
and
reducing
this
cenogenetic
form
of
gastrulation
to
the

is

depression

of

quite
independently

the
formation
of

gastrula
of
our
fish
is
complete
in

to
the
two
chief
forms
of
gastrula
we
considered
previously
we
give
the
name
of
discoid
gastrula
fig
to
this
third
principal
type
very
similar
to
the
discoid
gastrulation
of
the
bony

is
that
of
the
hags

myxinoida
the
remarkable
cyclostomes
that
live
parasitically
in
the
of

are
distinguished
by
several
notable
peculiarities
from
their
nearest
relatives
the
lampreys
while
the
amphiblastic
ova
of
the
latter
are
small

develop
like
those
of
the
amphibia
the
ova
of
the
hag
are
about
an
inch
long
and
form
a
discoid
gastrula
up
to
the
present
it
has
only
been
observed
in
one
species
by
dean
and
doflein
it
is
clear
that
the
important
features
which
distinguish
the
discoid
gastrula
from
the
other
chief
forms
we
have
considered
are
determined
by
the
large
this
takes
no
direct
part
in
the
building
of
the
germinal
layers
and
completely
fills
the
primitive
of
the
gastrula

protruding

the
if
we
imagine
the
original
figs
trying
to
swallow
a

food

is
much
bigger
than
itself
it
would
spread
out
round
it
in
discoid
shape
in
the
attempt
just
as
we
find
to
be
the
case
here
fig
hence
we
may
derive
the
discoid
gastrula
from
the
original
through
the
intermediate
stage
of
the
hooded
gastrula
it
has
arisen
through
the
accumulation
of
a
store

at
the

pole
a
being
thus
formed

to
the
nevertheless
the
gastrula
is
formed
here
as
in
the
previous
cases
by
the
folding
or
invagination
of
the
blastula
we
can
therefore
reduce
this
cenogenetic
form
of
the
discoid
segmentation
to
the
palingenetic
form
of
the
primitive

this

tolerably
easy

confident
in
the
case
of
the
small
ovum
of
our
bony
fish
but
it
becomes
difficult
and
uncertain
in
the
case
of
the
large
ova
that
we
find
in
the
majority
of
the
other
fishes

in

the
reptiles

birds
in
these
cases
the
is
in
the
first
place
comparatively
colossal
the
formative
yelk
being
almost
invisible
beside
it
and
in
the
second
place
the
contains
a
quantity
of
different
elements
which
are
known
as
and
so
on
frequently
these
definite
elements
in
the
yelk
have
been
described
as
real
cells
and
it
has
been
wrongly
stated
that
a
portion
of
the
embryonic
body
is
built
up
from
these
cells
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
in
every
case
however
large
it
even
when
travel
into
it
during
the
cleavage
of
the
nutritive
yelk
remains
a
dead
accumulation
of
food
which
is
taken
into
the
gut
during
embryonic
development

consumed

the

solely
from
the
living
formative
yelk

true

the

sharks

has
been
carefully
studied
of
late
years
by
ruckert
rabl
and
ziegler
in
particular
and
is
very
important
in
the
sense
that
this
group
is
the
oldest
among
living
fishes
and
their
gastrulation
can
be
derived
directly
from
that
of
the
cyclostoma
by
the
accumulation
of
a
large
quantity
of
the
oldest
sharks
still
have
the
unequal
segmentation
inherited
from
the
cyclostoma
but
while
in
this
case
as
in
the
case
of
the
amphibia
the
small
ovum
completely
divides
into
cells
in
segmentation
this
is
no
longer
so
in
the
great
majority
of
the
selachii
or
in
these
the
contractility
of
the
active
protoplasm
no
longer
suffices
to
break
up
the
huge
mass
of
the
passive
deutoplasm
completely
into
cells
this
is
only
possible
in
the
upper

dorsal
part

not
in

the

are
based
on
observations
of

the

much
more
difficult
to
obtain

study

for
this
practical
and
obvious
reason

in
any

at
any

we

the

very
often
quite
wrongly
must
examine
it
in
its
original
condition

follow
it
from
the
very
beginning
of
its
development
in
the
ovary
we
then
see
that
the
original
ovum
is
a
quite
small
naked
and
simple
cell
with
a
nucleus
not
differing
in
either
size
or

typical

greatly
disguised
can
thus
be
clearly
seen
in

case
as
goette
and
rauber
and
more
recently
duval
fig
have
shown
the
older
embryologists
pander
baer
remak
and
in
recent
times
especially
his
kölliker
and
others
said
that
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
of
the
oldest
and
most
frequent
subject
of
observation
by
horizontal
cleavage
of
a
simple
germinal
disk
in
opposition
to
this
accepted
view
i
affirmed
in
my
that
the
discoid
like
that
of
all
other
vertebrates
is
formed
by
folding
or
invagination
and
that
this
typical
process
is
merely
altered
in
a
peculiar
way
and
disguised
by
the
immense
accumulation
of
and
the
flat
spreading
of
the
discoid
blastula
at
one
part
of
its
surface
i
endeavoured
to
establish
this
view
by
the
derivation
of
the
vertebrates
from
one
source
and
especially
by
proving
that
the
birds
descend
from
the
reptiles
and
these
from
the
amphibia
if
this
is
correct
the
discoid
gastrula
of
the
amniotes
must
have
been
formed
by
the
of
a
hollow
blastula

has
been
shown
by
remak
and
rusconi

the
discoid

direct
ancestors
the
accurate
and
extremely
careful
observations
of
the
authors

have
mentioned
goette

duval
have
decisively
proved
this
recently
for

the

this
latest
and
most
advanced
class
of
the
vertebrates
has
as
we
shall
see
afterwards
evolved
at
a
comparatively
recent
date
from
an
older
group
of
reptiles
and
all
these
amniotes
must
have
come
originally
from
a
common
hence
the
distinctive
embryonic
process
of
the
mammal
must
have
arisen
by
cenogenetic
modifications
from
the
older
form
of
gastrulation
of
the
reptiles

this
thesis

can
not
understand
the
formation
of

in

therefore
in

i
first
advanced
this
fundamental
principle
in

essay
the
gastrulation
of
and
sought
to
show
in

way

i
assumed
a
gradual
degeneration
of
the

the

the

to
the

process
of
adaptation
i
said
has
occasioned
the
atrophy
of
the
rudimentary
of
the
mammal
is
perfectly
clear
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
young
of
the
mammal
whose
ancestors
were
certainly
oviparous
now
remain
a
long
time
in
the
womb
as
the
great
store
of
which
the
oviparous
ancestors
gave
to
the
egg
became
superfluous
in
their
descendants
owing
to
the
long
carrying
in
the
womb
and
the
maternal
blood
in
the
wall
of
the
uterus
made
itself
the
chief
source
of
nourishment
the
now
useless
was
bound
to
atrophy

embryonic
my
opinion
met
with
little
approval
at
the
time
it
was
vehemently
attacked
by
kölliker
hensen
and
his
in
particular
however
it
has
been
gradually
accepted
and
has
recently
been
firmly
established
by
a
large
number
of
excellent
studies
of
mammal
gastrulation

in
the
latest
edition
of
his
manual

hubrecht
in
his

have
supported
the
opinion
and
sought
to
derive
the
peculiarly
modified
gastrulation
of
the
mammal
from
that
of
the
reptile
in
the
meantime
the
studies
of
wilhelm
haacke
and
caldwell
provided
a
proof
of
the
and
very
interesting
fact
that
the
lowest
mammals
the
monotremes
eggs
like
the
birds
and
reptiles
and
are
not
viviparous
like
the
other
mammals
although
the
gastrulation
of
the
monotremes
was
not
really
known
until
studied
by
richard
semon
in
there
could
be
little
doubt
in
view
of
the
great
size
of
their
that
their
was
discoid
and
led
to
the
formation
of
a
discogastrula
as
in
the
case
of
the
reptiles
and
birds
hence
i
had
in
in
my
essay
on
gastrula
and
of
counted
the
monotremes
among
the
discoblastic
vertebrates
this
hypothesis
was
established
as
a
fact
nineteen
years
afterwards
by
the
careful
observations
of
semon
he
gave
in
the
second
volume
of
his
great
work

the
first

they
grow
considerably
during
development
so
that
when
laid
the
egg
is
three
times
as
large
the
structure
of
the
plentiful
yelk
and
especially
the
relation
of
the
yellow
and
the
white
yelk
are
just
the
same
as
in
the
reptiles
and
birds
as
with
these
partial
cleavage
takes
place
at
a
spot
on
the
surface
at
which
the
small
formative
yelk
and
the
nucleus
it
encloses
are
found
first

formed
a
circular
germinal
disk
this
is
made
up
of
several
strata
of
cells

it
spreads
over
the

thus
becomes

a

we
have
the
characteristic
blastula
of
the
higher
mammals
in
these
the
gastrulation
proceeds
in
two
phases
as
semon
rightly
observes
firstly
formation
of
the
entoderm
by
cleavage
at
the
centre
and
further
growth
at
the
edge
secondly
invagination
in
the
monotremes
more
primitive
conditions
have
been
retained
better
than
in
the
reptiles
and
birds
in
the
latter
before
the
commencement
of
the
we
have
at
least
at
the
periphery
a
embryo
forming
from
the
cleavage
but
in
the
monotremes
the
formation
of
the
cenogenetic
entoderm
does
not
precede
the
invagination

in
this
case
the

of

as

also
belongs

as
his
as
yet
unstudied
gastrulation
can
not
be
materially
different
from
that
of
the
other
placentals
it
merits
the
closest
attention
we
have
in
the
first
place
the
peculiar
feature
that
the
two
first
that
proceed
from
the

of

are
of
different

difference
is

sometimes

repeated

of

a
morula
is
formed
and
from
this
a
blastula
which
changes
in
a
very
characteristic
way
into
the
greatly
modified
gastrula
when
the
number
of
the

the

has
reached
in
the

about
seventy
hours
after

very
like

of

the
authors
who
regard
this
embryonic

as
the
primary
gastrula
of
the
placental
conceive
the
outer
layer
as
the
ectoderm
and
the
inner
as
the
entoderm
the
entodermic
membrane
is
only
interrupted
at

spot

two

full
of
entodermic

the
type
of
the
mammal
gastrula
is
accentuated
in
this
way
however
opinions
still
differ
considerably
as
to
the
real
nature
of
this
of
the
placental
and
its
relation
to
the
blastula
into
which
it
is
converted
as
the
gastrulation
proceeds
a
large
spherical
blastula
is
formed
from
this
peculiar
solid
amphigastrula
of
the
placental
as
we
saw
in
the
case
of
the
marsupial
the
accumulation
of
fluid
in
the
solid
gastrula
fig

leads
to
the
formation
of
an
eccentric

of
the

corresponds

the
cenogenetic
gastrulation
of

placental
has
been
greatly
modified
by
secondary
adaptation
in
the
various
groups
of
this
most
advanced
and
youngest
of
the
mammals
thus
for
instance
we
find
in
many
of
the
rodents
mice
etc
a
temporary
inversion
of
the
two
germinal
layers
this
is
due
to
a
folding
of
the
blastodermic
wall
by
what
is
called
the
a
growth
of
it
is
a
thin
layer
of
flat
epithelial
cells
that
is
freed
from
the
surface
of
the
blastoderm
in
some
of
the
rodents
it
has
no
more
significance
in
connection
with
the
general
course
of
placental
gastrulation
than
the
conspicuous
departure
from
the
usual
globular
shape
in
the
blastula
of
some
of
the
ungulates
in
some
pigs
and
ruminants
it
grows
into
a
long
and
thin
tube
thus
the
gastrulation
of
the
placentals
which
diverges
most
from
that
of
the
amphioxus
the
primitive
form
is
reduced
to
the
original
type
the
invagination
of
a
modified
blastula
its
chief
peculiarity
is
that
the
folded
part
of
the
blastoderm
does
not
form
a
completely
closed
only
open
at
the
primitive
mouth
blind
sac
as
is
usual
but
this
blind
sac
has
a
wide
opening
at
the
ventral
curve
opposite
to
the
dorsal
mouth
and
through
this
opening
the
primitive
gut
communicates
from
the
first
with
the
embryonic
cavity
of
the
blastula
the
folded
entoderm
grows
with
a
free
circular
border
on
the
inner
surface
of
the
entoderm
towards
the
vegetal
pole
when
it
has
reached
this
and
the
inner
surface
of
the
blastula
is
completely
grown
over
the
primitive
gut
is
closed
this
remarkable
direct
transition
of
the
primitive
into
the
is
explained
simply
by
the
assumption
that
in
most
of
the
mammals
the
which
is
still
possessed
by
the
oldest
forms
of
the
class
the
monotremes
and
their
ancestors
the
reptiles
is
atrophied
this
proves
the
essential
unity
of
gastrulation
in
all
the
vertebrates

in
order
to
complete
our
consideration
of
the
important
processes
of
segmentation
and
gastrulation
we
will
in
conclusion
cast
a
brief
glance
at
the
fourth
chief
segmentation
in
the
vertebrates
this
form
is
not
found
at
all
but
it
plays
the
chief
part
in
the
large
stem
of
the
insects
spiders
myriapods
and
crabs
the
distinctive
form
of
gastrula
that
comes
of
it
is
the
in
the
ova
which
undergo
this
superficial
cleavage
the
formative
yelk
is
sharply
divided
from
the
nutritive
yelk
as
in
the
preceding
cases
of
the
ova
of
birds
reptiles
fishes
etc
the
formative
yelk
alone
undergoes
cleavage
but
while
in
the
ova
with
discoid
gastrulation
the
formative
yelk
is
not
in
the
centre
but
at
one
pole
of
the
ovum
and
the
gathered
at
the
other
pole
in
the
ova
with
superficial
cleavage
we
find
the
formative
yelk
spread
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
ovum
it
encloses
spherically
the
which
is
accumulated
in
the
middle
of
the
ova
as
the
segmentation
only
affects
the
former
and
not
the
latter
it
is
bound
to
be
entirely
the
store
of
food
in
the
middle
is
quite
untouched
by
it
as
a
rule
it
proceeds
in
regular
geometrical
progression
in
the
end
the
whole
of
the
formative
yelk
divides
into
a
number
of
small
and
homogeneous
cells
which
lie
close
together
in
a
single
stratum
on
the
entire
surface
of
the
ovum
and
form
a
superficial
blastoderm
this
blastoderm
is
a
simple
completely
closed
vesicle
the
internal
cavity
of
which
is
entirely
full
of
this
real
blastula
only
differs
from
that
of
the
primitive
ova
in
its
chemical
composition
in
the
latter
the
content
is
water
or
a
watery
jelly
in
the
former
it
is
a
thick
mixture
rich
in
of
albuminous
and
fatty
substances
as
this
quantity
of
fills
the
centre
of
the
ovum
before
cleavage
begins
there
is
no
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
morula
and
the
blastula
the
two
stages
rather
agree
in
this
when
the
blastula
is
fully
formed
we
have
again
in
this
case
the
important
folding
or
invagination
that
determines
gastrulation
the
space
between
the
and
the
the
remainder
of
the
remains
full
of
which
is
gradually
used
up
this
is
the
only
material
difference
between
our
vesicular
gastrula
and
the
original
form
of
the
clearly
the
one
has
been
developed
from
the
other
in
the
course
of
time
owing
to
the
accumulation
of
in
the
centre
of
the
ovum
on
the
reduction
of
all
forms
of
gastrulation
to
the
original
palingenetic
form
see
especially
the
lucid
treatment
of
the
subject
in
arnold
of
comparative
part
i
we
must
count
it
an
important
advance
that
we
are
thus
in
a
position
to
reduce
all
the
various
embryonic
phenomena
in
the
different
groups
of
animals
to
these
four
principal
forms
of
segmentation
and
gastrulation
of
these
four
forms
we
must
regard
one
only
as
the
original
palingenetic
and
the
other
three
as
cenogenetic
and
derivative
the
unequal
the
discoid
and
the
superficial
segmentation
have
all
clearly
arisen
by
secondary
adaptation
from
the
primary
segmentation
and
the
chief
cause
of
their
development
has
been
the
gradual
formation
of
the
and
the
increasing
antithesis
between
animal
and
vegetal
halves
of
the

have

established

views

have
expounded
and
which
i
first
advanced
in

years
for
a
time
they
were
greatly
disputed
by
many
embryologists
some
said
that
the
original
embryonic
form
of
the
metazoa
was
not
the
gastrula
but
the
vesicle
with
closed
cavity
and
without
the
latter
was
supposed
to
pierce
through

it
was

a
careful

discriminative
distinction
between

therefore
a
new
acquisition
of
the
animal
body
much
younger
than
the
alimentary
system
and
of
great
importance
i
first
pointed
out
this
fundamental
significance
of
the
cœlom
in
my
on
the
in
the
section
which
draws
a
distinction
between
the
and
the
and
which
follows
immediately
on
the
theory
and
the
ancestral
tree
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
first
sketch
of
the
gastræa
theory
up
to
that
time
these
two
principal
cavities
of
the
animal
body
had
been
confused
or
very
imperfectly
distinguished
chiefly
because
leuckart
the
founder
of
the
cœlenterata
group
has
attributed
a
but
not
a
to
these
lowest
metazoa
in
reality
the
truth
is
just
the
other
way
about
the
ventral
cavity
the
original
organ
of
nutrition
in
the
multicellular
is
the
oldest
and
most
important
organ
of
all
the
metazoa
and
together
with
the
primitive
mouth
is
formed
in
every
case
in
the
gastrula
as
the
primitive
gut
it
is
only
at
a
much
later
stage
that
the
which
is
entirely
wanting
in
the
cœlenterata
is
developed
in
some
of
the
metazoa
between
the
ventral
and
the
body
wall
the
two
cavities
are
entirely
different
in
content
and
purport
the
alimentary
cavity
serves
the
purpose
of
digestion
it
contains
water
and
food
taken
from
without
as
well
as
the
pulp
chymus
formed
from
this
by
digestion
on
the
other
hand
the
quite
distinct
from
the
gut
and
closed
externally
has
nothing
to
do
with
digestion
it
encloses
the
gut
itself
and
its
glandular
appendages
and
also
contains
the
sexual
products
and
a
certain
amount
of
blood
or
lymph
a
fluid
that
is
transuded
through
the
ventral
wall
as
soon
as
the
appears
the
ventral
wall
is
found
to
be
separated
from
the
enclosing
but
the
two
continue
to
be
directly
connected
at
various
points
we
can
also
then
always
distinguish
a
number
of
different
layers
of
tissue
in
both
least
two
in
each
these
are
formed
originally
from
four
different
simple

are
the
four
secondary

the
one
covers
the
outer
surface
of

the
other
the
inner

of
the
ventral
wall
hence
they
are
called
confining
or
limiting

them

all

each

the

made
up
of
a
limiting

and
a

the
two
limiting
layers
chiefly
give
rise
to
epithelia
or
and
glands
and
nerves
while
the
middle
layers
form
the
great
bulk
of
the
fibrous

matter

the
latter
have
also
been

different

scientist
to

the

secondary

was
baer
it
is
true
that
he
was
not
quite
clear
as
to
their
origin
and
further
significance
and
made
several
mistakes
in
detail
in
explaining
them
but
on
the
whole
their
great
importance
did
not
escape
him
however
in
later
years
his
view
had
to
be
given
up
in
consequence
of
more
accurate
observations
remak
then
propounded
a
theory
which
was
generally
accepted
these
theories
of
cleavage
however
began
to
give
way
thirty
years
ago
when
kowalevsky
showed
that
in
the
case
of
a
very
clear
and
typical
subject
of
gastrulation
the
two
middle
germinal
layers
and
the
two
limiting
layers
arise
not
by
cleavage
but
by
a
secondary
invagination
of
the
primary
inner
this
invagination
or
folding
proceeds
from
the
primitive
mouth
at
the
two
sides
of
which
right

left
a

of

are
formed

these

themselves

in

were

considerable

constructed
in

cœlom
theory
in
order
to
appreciate
fully
the
great
merit
of
this
illuminating
and
helpful
theory
one
must
remember
what
a
chaos
of
contradictory
views
was
then
represented
by
the
of
the
mesoderm
or
the
of
the
origin
of
the
middle
germinal
the
cœlom
theory
brought
some
light
and
order
into
this
infinite
confusion
by
establishing
the
following
points
the
originates
in
the
great
majority
of
animals
especially
in
all
the
vertebrates
in
the
same
way
as
in
sagitta
a
couple
of
pouches
or
sacs
are
formed
by
folding
inwards
at
the
primitive
mouth
between
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
as
these
pouches
detach
from
the
primitive

a
pair
of
right
and
left
are
formed
the
coalescence
of
these
produces
a
simple
when
these

not
as
a

of
hollow
pouches

as

the
two
walls
of

and

been
pressed
together
by
the
expansion
of

hence
the
mesoderm
consists
from
the
first
of
genetically
distinct
layers
which
do
not
originate
by
the
cleavage
of
a
primary
simple
middle
layer
as
remak
supposed
these
two
middle
layers
have
in
all
vertebrates
and
the

of
the
invertebrates

traced
them

carl
rabl
comes
to
the

conclusion
in
his
able
theory
of
the
mesoderm
and
so
do
rauber
kupffer
ruckert
selenka
hatschek
and
others
there
is
a
general
agreement
in
these
and
many
other
recent
writers
that
all
the
different
forms
of
like
those
of
gastrulation
follow
one
and
the
same
strict
hereditary
law
in
the
vast
vertebrate
stem
in
spite
of
their
apparent
differences
they
are
all
only
cenogenetic
modifications
of
one
palingenetic
type
and
this
original
type
has
been
preserved
for
us
down
to
the
present
day
by
the
invaluable
amphioxus
but
before
we
go
into
the
regular
cœlomation
of
the
amphioxus
we
will
glance
at
that
of
the
a
remarkable

is
interesting
in
many
ways
for

anatomy

ontogeny
on
the
one
hand
the
transparency
of
the
body
and
the
embryo
and
on
the
other
hand
the
typical
simplicity
of
its
embryonic
development
make
the
sagitta
a
most
instructive
object
in
connection
with
various
problems
the
class
of
the
which
is
only
represented
by

of

spadella
is
in
another
respect
also
a
most
remarkable
branch
of

it
was
therefore
very
gratifying

of

the
however
in
these

which
we
class
together

this
important
process
is
more
complex
as
two
other
processes
are
associated
with
development
of
the
chorda

the
entoderm

the
separation
of
the
medullary

centre

here
again
the

amphioxus
has
preserved
to
our
own
time
by
tenacious
heredity
the
chief
phenomena
in
their
original
form
while
it
has
been
more
or
less
modified
by
embryonic
adaptation
in
all
the
other

hence
we
must
once
more
thoroughly
understand
the

the

it

not

hence
we
might
say
that
the

three

at

in
the
vertebrates
only
the
upper
part
of
this
vertical
partition
is
maintained
and
forms
the
dorsal
mesentery
this
mesentery
afterwards
takes
the
form
of
a
thin
membrane
which
fastens
the
visceral
tube
to
the
chorda
or
the
vertebral
column
at
the

blend
together

inner

median

breaking
down

disappearing

then
forms
a
single
simple
hollow
in
which
the
gut
is
quite
free
or
only
attached
to
the
dorsal
wall
by
means
of
the
mesentery
the
development
of
the
and
the
formation
of
the
in
the
higher
vertebrates
is
like
that
of
the
gastrula
chiefly
modified
by
the
pressure
of
the
on
the
embryonic
structures
which
forces
its
hinder
part
into
a
discoid
expansion
these
cenogenetic
modifications
seem
to
be
so
great
that
until
twenty
years
ago
these
important
processes
were
totally
misunderstood
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
in
man
and
the
higher
vertebrates
was
due
to
the
division
of
a
simple
middle
layer
and
that
the
latter
arose
by
cleavage
from
one
or
both
of
the
primary
germinal
layers
the
truth
was
brought
to
light
at
last
by
the
comparative
embryological
research
of
the
hertwigs
they
showed
in
their
that
all
vertebrates
are
true
enterocœla
and
that
in
every
case
a
pair
of
are
developed
from
the
primitive
gut
by
folding
the
cenogenetic
of
the
craniotes
must
therefore
be
derived
from
the
palingenetic
embryology
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
same
way
as
i
had
previously
proved
for
their
the
chief
difference
between
the
cœlomation
of
the
acrania
and
the
other
vertebrates
with
is
that
the
two
of
the
primitive
gut
in
the
former
are
from
the
first
hollow
vesicles
filled
with
fluid
but
in
the
latter
are
empty
pouches
the
layers
of
which
inner
and
outer
close
with
each
other
in
common
parlance
we
still
call
a
pouch
or
pocket
by
that
name
whether
it
is
full
or
empty
it
is
different
in
ontogeny
in
some
of
our
embryological
literature
ordinary
logic
does
not
count
for
very
much
in
many
of
the
manuals
and
large
treatises
on
this
science
it
is
proved
that
vesicles
pouches
or
sacs
deserve
that
name
only
when
they
are
inflated
and
filled
with
a
clear
fluid
when
they
are
not
so
filled
for
instance
when
the
primitive
gut
of
the
gastrula
is
filled
with
yelk
or
when
the
walls
of
the
empty
are
pressed
together
these
vesicles
must
not
be
cavities
any
longer
but
the
accumulation
of
in
the
ventral
wall
of
the
primitive
gut
figs
is
the
simple
cause
that
converts
the
of
the
acrania
into
the
of
the
craniotes
to
convince
ourselves
of
this
we
need
only
compare
with
hertwig
the
palingenetic
cœlomula
of
the
amphioxus
figs
with
the
corresponding
cenogenetic
form
of
the
amphibia
figs
and
construct
the

that
connects
the
two
figs

we
imagine

in

the
colossal

notable

however
as
the

been

late
date

their

traceable

finally
we
must
point
out
as
a

of

for

of

interest

the
explains

explains

the
vertebrate
character
of
man
we
have
now
secured
a
number
of
firm
in
the
labyrinthian
course
of
our
individual
development
by
our
study
of
the
important
embryonic
forms
which
we
have
called
the
cytula
morula
blastula
gastrula
cœlomula
and
chordula
but
we
have
still
in
front
of
us
the
difficult
task
of
deriving
the
complicated
frame
of
the
human
body
with
all
its
different
parts
organs
members
from
the
simple
form
of
the
chordula
we
have
previously
considered
the
origin
of
this
embryonic
form
from
the
gastrula
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
which
form
the
entire
body
of
the
gastrula
and
the
two
middle
layers
of
the
cœlomula
that
develop
between
them
are
the
four
simple
or
epithelia
which
alone
go
to
the
formation
of
the
complex
body
of
man
and
the
higher
animals
it
is
so
difficult
to
understand
this
construction
that
we
will
first
seek
a
companion
who
may
help
us
out
of
many
difficulties
this
helpful
associate
is
the
science
of
comparative
anatomy
its
task
is
by
comparing
the
bodily
forms
in
the
various
groups
of
animals
to
learn
the
general
laws
of
organisation
according
to
which
the
body
is
constructed
at
the
same
time
it
has
to
determine
the
affinities
of
the
various
groups
by
critical
appreciation
of
the
degrees
of
difference
between
them
formerly
this
work
was
conceived
in
a
teleological
sense
and
it
was
sought
to
find
traces
of
the
plan
of
the
creator
in
the
actual
purposive
organisation
of
animals
but
comparative
anatomy
has
gone
much
deeper
since
the
establishment
of
the
theory
of
descent
its
philosophic
aim
now
is
to
explain
the
variety
of
organic
forms
by
adaptation
and
their
similarity
by
heredity
at
the
same
time
it
has
to
recognise
in
the
shades
of
difference
in
form
the
degree
of
and
make
an
effort
to
construct
the
ancestral
tree
of
the
animal
world
in
this
way
comparative
anatomy
enters
into
the
closest
relations
with
comparative
embryology
on
the
one
hand
and
with
the
science
of
classification
on
the
other
now
when
we
ask
what
position
man
occupies
among
the
other
organisms
according
to
the
latest
teaching
of
comparative
anatomy
and
classification
and
how
place
in
the
zoological
system
is
determined
by
comparison
of
the
mature
bodily
forms
we
get
a
very
definite
and
significant
reply
and
this
reply
gives
us
extremely
important
conclusions
that
enable
us
to
understand
the
embryonic
development
and
its
evolutionary
purport
since
cuvier
and
baer
since
the
immense
progress
that
was
effected
in
the
early
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
these
two
great
zoologists
the
opinion
has
generally
prevailed
that
the
whole
animal
kingdom
may
be
distributed
in
a
small
number
of
great
divisions
or
types
they
are
called
types
because
a
certain
typical
or
characteristic
structure
is
constantly
preserved
within
each
of
these
large
sections
since
we
applied
the
theory
of
descent
to
this
doctrine
of
types
we
have
learned
that
this
common
type
is
an
outcome
of
heredity
all
the
animals
of
one
type
are
or
members
of
one
stem
and
can
be
traced
to
a
common
ancestral
form
cuvier
and
baer
set
up
four
of
these
types
the
vertebrates
articulates
molluscs
and
radiates
the
first
three
of
these
are
still
retained
and
may
be
conceived
as
natural
phylogenetic
unities
as
stems
or
in
the
sense
of
the
theory
of
descent
it
is
quite
otherwise
with
the
fourth
radiata
these
animals
little
known
as
yet
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
made
to
form
a
sort
of
into
which
were
cast
all
the
lower
animals
that
did
not
belong
to
the
other
three
types
as
we
obtained
a
closer
acquaintance
with
them
in
the
course
of
the
last
sixty
years
it
was
found
that
we
must
distinguish
among
them
from
four
to
eight
different
types
in
this
way
the
total
number
of
animal
stems
or
phyla
has
been
raised
to
eight
or
twelve
cf
chapter
xx
these
twelve
stems
of
the
animal
kingdom
are
however
by
no
means
and
independent
types
but
have
definite
relations
partly
of
subordination
to
each
other
and
a
very
different
phylogenetic
meaning
hence
they
must
not
be
arranged
simply
in
a
row
one
after
the
other
as
was
generally
done
until
thirty
years
ago
and
is
still
done
in
some
manuals
we
must
distribute
them
in
three
subordinate
principal
groups
of
very
different
value
and
arrange
the
various
stems
phylogenetically
on
the
principles
which
i
laid
down
in
my
on
the
sponges
and
developed
in
the
of
the
gastræa
we
have
first
to
distinguish
the
unicellular
animals
from
the
multicellular
only
the
latter
exhibit
the
important
processes
of
segmentation
and
gastrulation
and
they
alone
have
a
primitive
gut
and
form
germinal
layers
and
tissues
the
metazoa
the
or
then
into
two
main
sections
according
as
a
is
or
is
not
developed
between
the
primary
germinal
layers
we
may
call
these
the
and
the
former
are
often
also
called
or
and
the
latter
this
division
is
the
more
important
as
the
cœlenteria
without
cœlom
have
no
blood
and
nor
an
anus
the
cœlomaria
with
have
generally
an
anus
and
blood
and
there
are
four
stems
belonging
to
the
cœlenteria
the
gastræads
sponges
cnidaria
and
platodes
of
the
cœlomaria
we
can
distinguish
six
stems
the
vermalia
at
the
bottom
represent
the
common
derived
from
the
platodes
of
these
the
other
five
typical
stems
of
the
molluscs
echinoderms
articulates
tunicates
and
evolved
from
them
man
is
in
his
whole
structure
a
true
vertebrate
and
develops
from
an
impregnated
ovum
in
just
the
same
characteristic
way
as
the
other
vertebrates
there
can
no
longer
be
the
slightest
doubt
about
this
fundamental
fact
nor
of
the
fact
that
all
the
vertebrates
form
a
natural
phylogenetic
unity
a
single
stem
the
whole
of
the
members
of
this
stem
from
the
amphioxus
and
the
cyclostoma
to
the
apes
and
man
have
the
same
characteristic
disposition
connection
and
development
of
the
central
organs
and
arise
in
the
same
way
from
the
common
embryonic
form
of
the
chordula
without
going
into
the
difficult
question
of
the
origin
of
this
stem
we
must
emphasise
the
fact
that
the
vertebrate
stem
has
no
direct
affinity
whatever
to
five
of
the
other
ten
stems
these
five
isolated
phyla
are
the
sponges
cnidaria
molluscs
articulates
and
echinoderms
on
the
other
hand
there
are
important
and
to
an
extent
close
phylogenetic
relations
to
the
other
five
protozoa
through
the
amœbæ
the
gastræads
through
the
blastula
and
gastrula
the
platodes
and
vermalia
through
the
cœlomula
and
the
tunicates
through
the
chordula
how
we
are
to
explain
these
phylogenetic
relations
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
and
what
place
is
assigned
to
the
vertebrates
in
the
animal
ancestral
tree
will
be
considered
later
chapter
xx
for
the
present
our
task
is
to
make
plainer
the
vertebrate
character
of
man
and
especially
to
point
out
the
chief
peculiarities
of
organisation
by
which
the
vertebrate
stem
is
profoundly
separated
from
the
other
eleven
stems
of
the
animal
kingdom
only
after
these
considerations
shall
we
be
in
a
position
to
attack
the
difficult
question
of
our
embryology
the
development
of
even
the
simplest
and
lowest
vertebrate
from
the
simple
chordula
figs
is
so
complicated
and
difficult
to
follow
that
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
organic
features
of
the
vertebrate
in
order
to
grasp
the
course
of
its
embryonic
evolution
but
it
is
equally
necessary
to
confine
our
attention
in
this
general
anatomic
description
of
the
to
the
essential
facts
and
pass
by
all
the
unessential
hence
in
giving
now
an
ideal
anatomic
description
of
the
chief
features
of
the
vertebrate
and
its
internal
organisation
i
omit
all
the
subordinate
points
and
restrict
myself
to
the
most
important
characteristics
much
of
course
will
seem
to
the
reader
to
be
essential
that
is
only
of
subordinate
and
secondary
interest
or
even
not
essential
at
all
in
the
light
of
comparative
anatomy
and
embryology
for
instance
the
skull
and
vertebral
column
and
the
extremities
are
in
this
sense
it
is
true
that
these
parts
are
very
important
but
for
the
conception
of
the
vertebrate
they
are
not
essential
because
they
are
only
found
in
the
higher
not
the
lower
vertebrates
the
lowest
vertebrates
have
neither
skull
nor
vertebræ
and
no
extremities
or
limbs
even
the
human
embryo
passes
through
a
stage
in
which
it
has
no
skull
or
vertebræ
the
trunk
is
quite
simple
and
there
is
yet
no
trace
of
arms
and
legs
at
this
stage
of
development
man
like
every
other
higher
vertebrate
is
essentially
similar
to
the
simplest
vertebrate
form
which
we
now
find
in
only
one
living
specimen
this
one
lowest
vertebrate
that
merits
the
closest
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
vertebrates
after
the
famous
lancelet
or
amphioxus
to
which
we
have
already
often
referred
as
we
are
going
to
study
it
more
closely
later
on
chapters
xvi
and
xvii
i
will
only
make
one
or
two
passing
observations
on
it
here
the
amphioxus
lives
buried
in
the
sand
of
the
sea
is
about
one
or
two
inches
in
length
and
has
when
fully
developed
the
shape
of
a
very
simple
longish
leaf
hence
its
name
of
the
lancelet
the
narrow
body
is
compressed
on
both
sides
almost
equally
pointed
at
the
fore
and
hind
ends
without
any
trace
of
external
appendages
or
articulation
of
the
body
into
head
neck
breast
abdomen
etc
its
whole
shape
is
so
simple
that
its
first
discoverer
thought
it
was
a
naked
snail
it
was
not
until
much
a
century
the
tiny
creature
was
studied
more
carefully
and
was
found
to
be
a
true
vertebrate
more
recent
investigations
have
shown
that
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
in
connection
with
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
vertebrates
and
therefore
with
human
phylogeny
the
amphioxus
reveals
the
great
secret
of
the
origin
of
the
vertebrates
from
the
invertebrate
vermalia
and
in
its
development
and
structure
connects
directly
with
certain
lower
tunicates
the
ascidia
when
we
make
a
number
of
sections
of
the
body
of
the
amphioxus
firstly
vertical
longitudinal
sections
through
the
whole
body
from
end
to
end
and
secondly
transverse
sections
from
right
to
left
we
get
anatomic
pictures
of
the
utmost
instructiveness
cf
figs
in
the
main
they
correspond
to
the
ideal
which
we
form
with
the
aid
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
primitive
type
or
build
of
the
form
to
which
the
whole
stem
owes
its
origin
as
we
take
the
phylogenetic
unity
of
the
vertebrate
stem
to
be
beyond
dispute
and
assume
a
common
origin
from
a
primitive
for
all
the
vertebrates
from
amphioxus
to
man
we
are
justified
in
forming
a
definite
morphological
idea
of
this
primitive
vertebrate
or
we
need
only
imagine
a
few
slight
and
unessential
changes
in
the
real
sections
of
the
amphioxus
in
order
to
have
this
ideal
anatomic
figure
or
diagram
of
the
primitive
vertebrate
form
as
we
see
in
figs
the
amphioxus
departs
so
little
from
this
primitive
form
that
we
may
in
a
certain
sense
describe
it
as
a
modified
the
ideal
figure
of
the
vertebrate
as
given
in
figs
is
a
hypothetical
scheme
or
diagram
that
has
been
chiefly
constructed
on
the
lines
of
the
amphioxus
but
with
a
certain
attention
to
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
ascidia
and
appendicularia
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
cyclostoma
and
selachii
on
the
other
this
diagram
has
no
pretension
whatever
to
be
an
picture
but
merely
an
attempt
to
reconstruct
hypothetically
the
unknown
and
long
extinct
vertebrate
an
ideal
the
outer
form
of
our
hypothetical
primitive
vertebrate
was
at
all
events
very
simple
and
probably
more
or
less
similar
to
that
of
the
lancelet

the
division
of
the
body
into

sections
head
and

was
probably
clearer
in
than
it
is
in
its
ancestor
the

of
the

contains
different
organs
from
the

and

this
important

is
found

it
was
also

it

very
pronounced
in

the

when

horizontal
longitudinal

through

the
whole

divides
into
a
dorsal
and
a
ventral
half
the
line
of

that
passes
through
the

from
right
to

is
the
transverse

the
two
halves
of
the
vertebrate
body
that
are
separated
by
this
horizontal
transverse
axis
and
by
the
chorda
have
quite
different
characters
the
dorsal
half
is
mainly
the
animal
part
of
the
body
and
contains
the
greater
part
of
what
are
called
the
animal
organs
the
nervous

muscular
system
osseous
system
instruments
of
movement
and

the
ventral

is
essentially
the
vegetative
half
of

and
contains
the
greater
part
of
the
vegetal
organs
the
visceral
and
vascular
systems
sexual
system
instruments
of
nutrition
and
reproduction
hence
in
the
construction
of
the
dorsal
half
it
is
chiefly
the
outer
and
in
the
construction
of
the
ventral
half
chiefly
the
inner
germinal
layer
that
is
engaged
each
of
the
two
halves
develops
in
the
shape
of
a
tube
and
encloses
a
cavity
in
which
another
tube
is
found
the
dorsal
half
contains
the
narrow
cavity
or
vertebral
canal
the
chorda
in
which
lies
the
central
nervous
system
the
medullary

the
ventral
half
contains
the
much
more
spacious
visceral

or
the

in
which
we
find
the

all
its

the

the

or
psychic

of

its
first

in
man
and
all
the
higher
vertebrates
of
two
different
parts
the
large
brain
contained
in
the
skull
and
the
long
spinal
cord
which
stretches
from
there
over
the
whole
dorsal
part
of
the
trunk
even
in
the
primitive
vertebrate
this
composition
is
plainly
indicated
the

half
of
the

which
corresponds
to
the
head
encloses
a
vesicle
the
brain
this
is
prolonged
backwards
into
the
thin
cylindrical
tube
of
the
spinal
marrow
hence
we
find
here
this
very
important
psychic
organ
which
accomplishes
sensation
will
and
thought
in
the
vertebrates
in
its
simplest
form
the
thick
wall
of
the
which
runs
through
the
long
axis
of
the
body
immediately
over
the
axial
rod
encloses
a
narrow
central
canal
filled
with
fluid
figs
we
still
find
the
medullary
tube
in
this
very
simple
form
for
a
time
in
the
embryo
of
all
the
vertebrates
and
it
retains
this
form
in
the
amphioxus
throughout
life
only
in
the
latter
case
the
cylindrical
medullary
tube
barely
indicates
the
separation
of
brain
and
spinal
cord
the
medullary
tube
runs
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
body
above
the
chorda
in
the
shape
of
a
long
thin
tube
of
almost
equal
diameter
throughout
and
there
is
only
a
slight
swelling
of
it
right
at
the
front
to
represent
the
rudiment
of
a
cerebral
lobe
it
is
probable
that
this
peculiarity
of
the
amphioxus
is
connected
with
the
partial
atrophy
of
its
head
as
the
ascidian
larvæ
on
the
one
hand
and
the
young
cyclostoma
on
the
other
clearly
show
a
division
of
the
vesicular
brain
or
head
marrow
from
the
thinner
tubular
spinal
marrow
probably
we
must
trace
to
the
same
phylogenetic
cause
the
defective
nature
of
the
sense
organs
of
the
amphioxus
which
we
will
describe
later

xvi

of

in
the
lateral

of
the

and
a
pair
of
simple
auscultory
vesicles
behind
there
was
also
perhaps
a
single
parietal
or
eye
at
the
top
of
the
skull
in
the
vertical
median
plane
or
middle
plane
dividing
the
bilateral
body
into

we
have
in
the
acrania
underneath
the

the
mesentery

above
it
the
medullary

and
above
the
latter
a
membranous
partition
of
the
two
halves
of
the
body
with
this
partition
is
connected
the
mass
of
connective
tissue
which
acts
as
a
sheath
both
for
the
medullary
tube
and
the
underlying
chorda
and
is
therefore
called
the

originates
from
the
dorsal

call
the

we
find
in
all
the
vertebrates
the
large
masses
of
muscle
that
constitute
the
musculature
of
the

its

connected
in
the
developed
vertebrate
corresponding
to
the
various
parts
of
the
bony
skeleton
in
our
ideal
primitive

we
can
distinguish
only
two
pairs
of
these
principal
muscles
which
run
the
whole
length
of
the
body
parallel
to
the
chorda
these
are

the
myotomes

also
developed
from
the
thick

of
the

outside
this
muscular

we
have
the
external
envelope
of
the
vertebrate
body
which
is
known
as
the
corium

this
strong

chiefly
of
fat

loose
connective
tissue

in
its
upper
layers

it
covers
the
whole

of
the
fleshy
body
and
is
of
considerable
thickness
in

in
the
acrania
the
corium
is
merely
a
thin

of

insignificant

immediately
above
the

still
briefly
called
the
cœloma
formerly
it
was
known
in
anatomy
as
the
pleuroperitoneal
cavity
in
man

the
other
mammals
but
only
in
these
this
cœloma
divides
when
fully
developed
into
two
different
cavities
which
are
separated
by
a
transverse
muscular
diaphragm
the
fore

the
hind

but
in
the
vertebrate
embryo
before
the
diaphragm
is
developed
the
two
cavities
form
a
single
continuous
and
we
find
it
thus
in
all
the
lower

this
is
clothed
with
a
delicate
layer

of
this
kind
are
the
salivary
glands
the
lungs
the
liver
and
many
smaller
glands
nearly
all
these

are
wanting

there
were
merely
a
couple
of
simple

composed
of
muscular

which
accomplish
the

movements
of

of

that
form
a

we
have
a
continuation
of
it
in
the
mesentery
a
thin
layer

fastened
to

variously
modified
in

as

in
its
several
sections
though
the
original
structure
is
always
the

and
is
very
simple

it
is
longer

several
times
longer
than

therefore
folded

all
these
parts
develop
from
a
very
simple
structure

originally
throughout
life
in
the
amphioxus
runs
from
end
to
end
under
the
chorda
in
the
shape
of
a
straight
cylindrical
canal
as
the
alimentary
canal
may
be
regarded
morphologically
as
the
oldest
and
most
important
organ
in
the
body
it
is
interesting
to
understand
its
essential
features
in
the
vertebrate
more
fully
and
distinguish
them
from
unessential
features
in
this
connection
we
must
particularly
note
that
the
alimentary
canal
of
every
vertebrate
shows
a
very
characteristic
division
into
two
fore
and
a
hind
chamber
the
fore
chamber
is
the
or
branchial
gut
figs
and
is
chiefly
occupied
with
respiration
the
hind
section
is
the
or
hepatic
gut
which
accomplishes
digestion
in
all
vertebrates
there
are
formed
at
an
early
stage
to
the
right
and
left
in
the
of
the
certain
special
clefts
that
have
an
intimate
connection
with
the
original
respiratory
apparatus
of
the
branchial
gill
clefts
all
the
lower
vertebrates
the
lancelets
lampreys
and
fishes
are
constantly
taking
in
water
at
the
mouth
and
letting
it
out
again
by
the
lateral
clefts
of
the
gullet
this
water
serves
for
breathing
the
oxygen
contained
in
it
is
inspired
by
the
which
spread
out
on
the
parts
between
the
the
these
very
characteristic
branchial
clefts
and
arches
are
found
in
the
embryo
of
man
and
all
the
higher
vertebrates
at
an
early
stage
of
development
just
as
we
find
them
throughout
life
in
the
lower
vertebrates
however
these
clefts
and
arches
never
act
as
respiratory
organs
in
the
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
but
gradually
develop
into
quite
different
parts
still
the
fact
that
they
are
found
at
first
in
the
same
form
as
in
the
fishes
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
proofs
of
the
descent
of
these
three
higher
classes
from
the
fishes
not
less
interesting
and
important
is
an
organ
that
develops
from
the
ventral
wall
in
all
or
hypobranchial
groove
in
the
acrania
and
the
ascidiæ
it
consists
throughout
life
of
a
glandular
ciliated
groove
which
runs
down
from
the
mouth
in
the
ventral
middle
line
of
the
and
takes
small
particles
of
food
to
the
stomach
fig
but
in
the
craniota
the
thyroid
gland
is
developed
from
it
the
gland
that
lies
in
front
of
the
larynx
and
which
when
pathologically
enlarged
forms
goitre
from
the
we
get
not
only
the
gills
the
organs
of
in
the
lower
vertebrates
but
also
the
lungs
the
organs
of
atmospheric
breathing
in
the
five
higher
classes
in
these
cases
a
vesicular
fold
appears
in
the
gullet
of
the
embryo
at
an
early
stage
and
gradually
takes
the
shape
of
two
spacious
sacs
which
are
afterwards
filled
with
air
these
sacs
are
the
two
lungs
which
take
the
place
of
the
gills
but
the
vesicular
invagination
from
which
the
lungs
arise
is
merely
the
familiar
vesicle
which
we
call
the
of
the
fish
and
which
alters
its
specific
weight
acting
as
hydrostatic
organ
or
floating
apparatus
this
structure
is
not
found
in
the
lowest
vertebrate
acrania

cyclostoma

shall
see
more
of
it

a

elaborate
construction

seems
to
have

a
very
simple

in
the
primitive
vertebrate
as
we
find
it
permanently
in
the
annelids
for
instance

the
amphioxus

accordingly
distinguish
first

essential

along

alimentary
canal

the
median
plane
of
the
body
one
above
and
the
other
underneath
the
canal
these
principal
canals
give
out
numerous
branches
to
all
parts
of
the
body
and
pass
into
each
other
by
arches
before
and
behind
we
will
call
them
the
primitive

the
primitive

lies
below

therefore
also
called
the

by
a
number
of
branches

a
direct

the

act

organs

a
very
different
and
elaborate
construction
in
the
various
sections
of
this
stem
we
will
consider
them
further
in
chapter
here
i
need
only
mention
that
in
our
hypothetical
primitive
vertebrate
they
probably
had
the
same
form
as
in
the
actual
primitive
kidneys
these
are
originally
made
up
of
a
double
row
of
little
canals
which
directly
convey
the
juices

the
urine

of

a
couple
of
longitudinal
grooves
in

lateral

of

outer

the
pronephridial
duct
is
formed
by
the
closing
of
this
groove
to
the
right
and
left
at
the
sides
in
all
the
craniota
it
develops
at
an
early
stage

seems
to
be
converted

a
wide

kidneys
we
have
the
sexual
organs
of
the
vertebrate
in
most
of
the
members
of
this
stem
the
two
are
united
in
a
single
urogenital
system
it
is
only
in
a
few
groups
that
the
urinary
and
sexual
organs
are
separated
in
the
amphioxus
the
cyclostoma
and
some
sections
of
the
in
man
and
all
the
higher
vertebrates
the
sexual
apparatus
is
made
up
of
various
parts
which
we
will
consider
in
chapter
xxix
but
in
the
two
lowest
classes
of
our
stem
the
acrania
and
cyclostoma
they
consist
merely
of
simple
sexual
glands
or
gonads
the
ovaries
of
the
female
sex
and
the
testicles
of
the
male
the
former
provide
the
ova
the
latter

sperm
in
the
craniota
we
always
find
only
one
pair
of
gonads
in
the
amphioxus
several
pairs
arranged
in
succession
they
must
have
had
the
same
form
in
our
hypothetical
prospondylus
figs
these
segmental
pairs
of
gonads
are
the
original
ventral
halves
of
the
the
organs
which
we
have
now
enumerated
in
this
general
survey
and
of
which
we
have
noted
the
characteristic
disposition
are
those
parts
of
the
organism
that
are
found
in
all
vertebrates
without
exception
in
the
same
relation
to
each
other
however
much
they
may
be
modified
we
have
chiefly
had
in
view
the
transverse
section
of
the
body
figs
because
in
this
we
see
most
clearly
the
distinctive
arrangement
of
them
but
to
complete
our
picture
we
must
also
consider
the
segmentation
or
of
them
which
has
yet
been
hardly
noticed
and
which
is
seen
best
in
the
longitudinal
section
in
man
and
all
the
more
advanced
vertebrates
the
body
is
made
up
of
a
series
or
chain
of
similar
members
which
succeed
each
other
in
the
long
axis
of
the
segments
or
metamera
of
the
organism
in
man
these
homogeneous
parts
number
in
the
trunk
but
they
run
to
several
hundred
in
many
of
the
vertebrates
such
as
serpents
or
eels
as
this
internal
articulation
or
metamerism
is
mainly
found
in
the
vertebral
column
and
the
surrounding
muscles
the
sections
or
metamera
were
formerly
called
as
a
fact
the
articulation
is
by
no
means
chiefly
determined
and
caused
by
the
skeleton
but
by
the
muscular
system
and
the
segmental
arrangement
of
the
kidneys
and
gonads
however
the
composition
from
these
or
internal
metamera
is
usually
and
rightly
put
forward
as
a
prominent
character
of
the
vertebrate
and
the
manifold
division
or
differentiation
of
them
is
of
great
importance
in
the
various
groups
of
the
vertebrates
but
as
far
as
our
present
derivation
of
the
simple
body
of
the
primitive
vertebrate
from
the
concerned
the
articulate
parts
or
metamera
are
of
secondary
interest

not
go

historical

the
answer
to
question
of

point
out
that
this
answer
is
just
as
certain
and
precise
in
the
case
of
the
origin
of

from
the

this
advanced
vertebrate
class
is
also
monophyletic
or
has
evolved
from
one
common
of
lower
vertebrates
reptiles
and
earlier
still

this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
mammals
are
clearly
distinguished
from
the
other
classes
of
the
stem
not
merely
in
one
striking
particular

in
a
whole
group
of
distinctive
characters
it

only
in

this
purpose
are
interesting
in
so
many
ways
that
we
may
devote
a
few
lines
to
them

as
is
well
known
the
lower

these
variations
in

have
become
doubly
interesting
in
the
light
of
recent
research
in
comparative
anatomy

has
been
shown

often
find

shown
that
these

are
not
uncommon
in
the

as
well
as
the
female
sex
they
can
only
be
explained
by
evolution
which
attributes
them
to
atavism
and
latent
heredity
the
earlier
ancestors
of
all
the
primates
including
man
were
lower
placentals

had
like
the

one
of
the
oldest
forms

are
normally
developed
but
from
time
to

we
get
a
development
of
the
atrophied

special
notice
should
be
taken
of
the
arrangement
of
these
accessory
mammæ

explanation
of
polymastism

given
in

has
lately
found
considerable
support
in
ontogeny

strahl
schmitt

have
found

there
are
always

the
sixth
week

it
is
of
an
inch
long

microscopic
traces
of
five

they
are
arranged

lateral
and
divergent
lines

correspond
to
the

lines
only
one

central
normally
developed
the
others
atrophying
hence
there
is
for
a
time
in
the
human
embryo
a
normal
hyperthelism
and
this
can
only
be
explained
by
the
descent
of
man
from
lower
primates

with
several
pairs

the
of
the

a
great
morphological
interest

feeding
the
young

the

as
is
known

in

however
it
is
usually
active
only
in
the
female
sex
and
yields
the
valuable
in
the
male
sex
it
is
small
and
inactive
a
real
rudimentary
organ
of
no
physiological
interest
nevertheless
in
certain
cases
we
find
the
breast
as
fully
developed
in
man
as
in
woman
and
it
may
give
milk

feeding

has
rendered
service
by
a
number
of
anthropological
observations
for
instance
in
several
cases
of
tailed
men
the
gynecomast
in
question
is
a
greek
recruit
in
his
twentieth
year
who
has
both
normally
developed
male
organs
and
very
pronounced
female

it
is
noteworthy
that
the
other
features
of
his
structure
are
in
accord
with
the
softer
forms
of
the
female
sex
it
reminds
us
of
the
marble
statues
of
hermaphrodites
which
the
ancient
greek
and
roman
sculptors
often
produced

the
man
would
only
be
a

hermaphrodite

he
had
ovaries

more
feminine

in

very
small

one
could
feel
nothing
of
the
testicles

the
inguinal
canal

the
other

organ

very
small

practical
gynecomastism

been
described
by
alexander
von

south
american
forest

found
a
solitary
settler
whose
wife
had
died
in
the
man
had
laid
the
child
on
his
own
breast
in
despair
and
the
continuous
stimulus
of
the
sucking
movements
had
revived
the
activity
of
the
mammary
glands
it
is
possible
that
nervous
suggestion
had
some
share
in
it
similar
cases
have
been
often
observed
in
recent
years
even
among
other
male
mammals
such
as

the
great
scientific
interest
of
these
facts
is
in
their
bearing
on
the
question
of
heredity
the
of
the
mammarium
rests
partly
on
its
embryology
chapter
xxiv
and
partly
on
the
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
and
physiology
as
in
the
lower
and
higher
mammals
the
monotremes
and
most
of
the
marsupials
the
whole
lactiferous
apparatus
is
only
found
in
the
female
and
as
there
are
traces
of
it
in
the
male
only
in
a
few
younger
marsupials
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
important
organs
were
originally
found
only
in
the
female
mammal
and
that
they
were
acquired
by
these
through
a
special
adaptation
to
habits
of
life
later
these
female
organs
were
communicated
to
both
sexes
by
heredity
and
they
have
been
maintained
in
all
persons
of
either
sex
although
they
are
not
physiologically
active
in
the
males
this
normal
permanence
of
the
female
lactiferous
organs

instance
of
the

embryonic
shield
and
germinative
area
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
which
we
call
the
mammals
birds
and
notably
distinguished
by
a
number
of
peculiarities
of
their
development
from
the
five
lower
classes
of
the
animals
without
an
amnion
the
all
the
amniotes
have
a
distinctive
embryonic
membrane
known
as
the
amnion
or
and
a
special
embryonic
allantois
they
have
further
a
large
which
is
filled
with
in
the
reptiles
and
birds
and
with
a
corresponding
clear
fluid
in
the
mammals
in
consequence
of
these
structures
the
original
features
of
the
development
of
the
amniotes
are
so
much
altered
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
reduce
them
to
the
palingenetic
embryonic
processes
of
the
lower
vertebrates
the
gastræa
theory
shows
us
how
to
do
this
by
representing
the
embryology
of
the
lowest
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
as
the
original
form
and
deducing
from
it
through
a
series
of
gradual
modifications
the
gastrulation
and
cœlomation
of
the
craniota
it
was
somewhat
fatal
to
the
true
conception
of
the
chief
embryonic
processes
of
the
vertebrate
that
all
the
older
embryologists
from
malpighi
and
wolff
to
baer
and
remak
always
started
from
the
investigation
of
the
egg
and
transferred
to
man
and
the
other
vertebrates
the
impressions
they
gathered
from
this
this
classical
object
of
embryological
research
is
as
we
have
seen
a
source
of
dangerous
errors
the
large
round
of
the
egg
causes
in
the
first
place
a
flat
discoid
expansion
of
the
small
gastrula
and
then
so
distinctive
a
development
of
this
thin
round
embryonic
disk
that
the
controversy
as
to
its
significance
occupies
a
large
part
of
embryological
literature
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
errors
that
this
led
to
was
the
idea
of
an
original
antithesis
of
germ
and
yelk
the
latter
was
regarded
as
a
foreign
body
extrinsic
to
the
real
germ
whereas
it
is
properly
a
part
of
it
an
embryonic
organ
of
nutrition
many
authors
said
there
was
no
trace
of
the
embryo
until
a
later
stage
and
outside
the
yelk
sometimes
the
embryonic
disk
itself
at
other
times
only
the
central
portion
of
it
as
distinguished
from
the
germinative
area
which
we
will
describe
presently
was
taken
to
be
the
first
outline
of
the
embryo
in
the
light
of
the
gastræa
theory
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
dwell
on
the
defects
of
this
earlier
view
and
the
erroneous
conclusions
drawn
from
it
in
reality
the
first
and
even
the
itself
and
all
that
issues
therefrom
belong
to
the
embryo
as
the
large
original

the
undivided
egg

the
bird

an
inclosure
in
the
greatly
enlarged
ovum
so
the
later
contents
of
its
embryonic
whether
yet
segmented
or
not
are
only
a
part
of
the
entoderm
which
forms
the
primitive
gut
this
is
clearly
shown
by
the
ova
of
the
amphibia
and
cyclostoma

explain
the
transition
from
the

of
the
amphioxus

of
phylogenetic
considerations
in
explaining
complex
ontogenetic
facts
and
the
need
of
separating
cenogenetic
phenomena
from

this
is
particularly
clear
as
regards
the
comparative
embryology
of
the
vertebrates
because
here
the
phylogenetic
unity
of
the
stem
has
been
already
established
by
the
facts
of
paleontology
and
comparative
anatomy
if
this
unity
of
the
stem
on
the
basis
of
the
amphioxus
were
always
borne
in
mind
we
should
not
have
these
errors
constantly
recurring
in
many
cases
the
cenogenetic
relation
of
the
embryo
to
the
has
until
now
given
rise
to
a
quite
wrong
idea
of
the
first
and
most
important
embryonic
processes
in
the
higher
vertebrates
and
has
occasioned
a
number
of
false
theories
in
connection
with
them
until
thirty
years
ago
the
embryology
of
the
higher
vertebrates
always
started
from
the
position
that
the
first
structure
of
the
embryo
is
a
flat
disk
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
that
compose
this
germinal
disk
also
called
germinative
area
are
called
this
flat
germinal
disk
which
is
round
at
first
and
then
oval
and
which
is
often
described
as
the
tread
or
cicatricula
in
the
laid
egg
is
found
at
a
certain
part
of
the
surface
of
the
large
globular

am
convinced
that
it
is
nothing
else
than
the
discoid
flattened
gastrula
of
the
birds
at
the
beginning
of
germination
the
flat
embryonic
disk
curves
outwards
and
separates
on
the
inner
side
from
the
underlying
large
in
this
way
the
flat
layers
are
converted
into
tubes
their
edges
folding
and
joining
together
fig
as
the
embryo
grows
at
the
expense
of
the
the
latter

smaller
and
smaller
it
is
completely
surrounded

the
germinal
layers

in

of
the

entirely
absorbed
by
this
the
point
at
which
this
takes
place
and
where
the
gut
finally
closes

the
visceral
navel

the
mammals

which
the
remainder

the
remains
without

atrophies

the

the
umbilical
cord
proceeds
from
here
and
the
point
of
closure
remains
throughout
life
in
the
skin
as
the
navel
as
the
older
embryology
of
the
higher
vertebrates
was
mainly
based
on
the
chick
and
regarded
the
antithesis
of
embryo
or
and
or
as
original
it
had
also
to
look
upon
the
flat
structure
of
the
germinal
disk
as
the
primitive
embryonic
form
and
emphasise
the
fact
that
hollow
grooves
were
formed
of
these
flat
layers
by
folding
and
closed
tubes
by
the
joining
together
of
their
edges
this
idea
which
dominated
the
whole
treatment
of
the
embryology
of
the
higher
vertebrates
until
thirty
years
ago
was
totally
false
the
gastræa
theory
which
has
its
chief
application
here
teaches
us
that
it
is
the
very
reverse
of
the
truth
the
gastrula
in
the
of
which
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
appear
from
the
first
as
closed
tubes
is
the
original
embryonic
form
of
all
the
vertebrates
and
all
the
multicellular
invertebrates
and
the
flat
germinal
disk
with
its
superficially
expanded
germinal
layers
is
a
later
secondary
form
due
to
the
cenogenetic
formation
of
the
large
and
the
gradual
spread
of
the
over
its
surface
hence
the
actual
folding
of
the
germinal
layers
and
their
conversion
into
tubes
is
not
an
original
and
primary
but
a
much
later
and
tertiary
evolutionary
process
in
the
phylogeny
of
the
vertebrate
embryonic
process
we
may
distinguish
the
following
three
stages
a
first
stage
primary
palingenic
embryonic
process
b
second
stage
secondary
cenogenetic
embryonic
process
third
stage
tertiary
cenogenetic
embryonic
process
the
germinal
layers
form
from
the
first
closed
tubes

blastula
being
converted
into
the
gastrula
by
invagination
no
the
germinal
layers
spread
out
gathering
in

ventral
entoderm
and
a
large
being
formed
from
the
middle
of
the
the
germinal
layers
form
a
flat
germinal
disk
the
borders
of
which
join
together
and
form
closed
tubes
separating
from
the
central
as
this
theory
a
logical
conclusion
from
the
gastræa
theory
has
been
fully
substantiated
by
the
comparative
study
of
gastrulation
in
the
last
few
decades
we
must
exactly
reverse
the
hitherto
prevalent
mode
of
treatment
the
is
not
to
be
treated
as
was
done
formerly
as
if
it
were
originally
antithetic
to
the
embryo
but
as
an
essential
part
of
it
a
part
of
its
visceral
tube
the
primitive
gut
of
the
gastrula
has
on
this
view
been
divided
into
two
parts
in
the
higher
animals
as
a
result
of
the
cenogenetic
formation
of
the
permanent
gut
or
permanent
alimentary
canal
and
the
or
umbilical
vesicle
this
is
very
clearly
shown
by
the
comparative
ontogeny
of
the
fishes
and
amphibia
in
these
cases
the
whole
yelk
undergoes
cleavage
at
first
and
forms
a
composed
of
in
the
ventral
wall
of
the
primitive
gut
but
it
afterwards
becomes
so
large
that
a
part
of
the
yelk
does
not
divide
and
is
used
up
in
the
that
is
cut
off
outside
when
we
make
a
comparative
study
of
the
embryology
of
the
amphioxus
the
frog
the
chick
and
the
rabbit
there
can
not
in
my
opinion
be
any
further
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
this
position
which
i
have
held
for
thirty
years
hence
in
the
light
of
the
gastræa
theory
we
must
regard
the
features
of
the
amphioxus
as
the
only
and
real
primitive
structure
among
all
the
vertebrates
departing
very
little
from
the
palingenetic
embryonic
form
in
the
cyclostoma
and
the
frog
these
features
are
on
the
whole
not
much
altered
cenogenetically
but
they
are
very
much
so
in
the
chick
and
most
of
all
in
the
rabbit
in
the
of
the
amphioxus
and
in
the
hooded
gastrula
of
the
lamprey
and
the
frog
the
germinal
layers
are
found
to
be
closed

the
other

the

the
new

not
yet
hatched
egg

a
flat
circular
disk
and
it
was
not
easy
to
recognise
this
as
a
real
gastrula
rauber
and
goette
have
however
achieved
this
as
the
discoid
gastrula
grows
round
the
large
globular
yelk

the
permanent
gut
then
separates
from
the
outlying

find
all
the

we
have

were

quite
misinterpreted

not

the
publication

van

the
later
research
of
selenka
kuppfer
rabl
and
others
that
light
was
thrown
on
them
and
we
were
in
a
position
to
bring
them
into
line
with
the
principles
of
the
gastræa
theory
and
trace
them
to
the
embryonic
forms
of
the
lower
vertebrates
although
there
is
no
independent
apart
from
the
formative
yelk
in
the
mammal
ovum
and
although
its
segmentation
is
total
on
that
account
nevertheless
a
large
is
formed
in
their
embryos
and
the
spreads
over
its
surface
as
in
the
reptiles
and
birds
which
have
a
large
and
partial
segmentation
in
the
mammals
as
well
as
in
the
latter
the
flat
germinal
disk
separates
from
the
and
its
edges
join
together
and
form
tubes
how
can
we
explain
this
curious
anomaly
only
as
a
result
of
very
characteristic
and
peculiar
cenogenetic
modifications
of
the
embryonic
process
the
real
causes
of
which
must
be
sought
in
the
change
in
the
rearing
of
the
young
on
the
part
of
the
viviparous
mammals
these
are
clearly
connected
with
the
fact
that
the
ancestors
of
the
viviparous
mammals
were
oviparous
amniotes
like
the
present
monotremes
and
only
gradually
became
viviparous
this
can
no
longer
be
questioned
now
that
it
has
been
shown
that
the
monotremes
the
lowest
and
oldest
of
the
mammals
still
lay
eggs
and
that
these
develop
like
the
ova
of
the
reptiles
and
birds
their
nearest
descendants
the
marsupials
formed
the
habit
of
retaining
the
eggs
and
developing
them
in
the
oviduct
the
latter
was
thus
converted
into
a
womb
uterus
a
nutritive
fluid
that
was
secreted
from
its
wall
and
passed
through
the
wall
of
the
blastula

served
to
feed
the
embryo
and
took
the
place
of
the
in
this
way
the
original
of
the
monotremes
gradually
atrophied
and
at
last
disappeared
so
completely
that
the
partial
of
their
descendants
the
rest
of
the
mammals
once
more
became
total
from
the
of
the
former

evolved

distinctive
of
the
latter

is
only
by
this
phylogenetic
explanation
that
we
can
understand
the
formation
and
development
of
the
peculiar
and
hitherto
totally
misunderstood

in

on

these
thin

are
so
firmly
pressed
together
that
they
seem
to
represent
a

it
is
thus
peculiar
to
the
amniotes
that
the
middle
of

is
composed
of
four
germinal

these

can

soon
as
what
is
called
the

is
seen
at

border
of

at

however
the

of

only
consists
of
two
layers
the
rest
of

of

consists
at
first
but
only
for
a
short
time
in
most
of
the

of
a
single
layer

outer
germinal

from
this
stage
however
the
whole
wall
of
the
embryonic

becomes
the
middle
of
the

is
much
thickened
by
the
growth
of
the
cells
of
the
middle
layers
and
the
inner

expands
at
the

time
and
increases
at
the
border
of
the
disk

round
lying
close
on

grows

its
inner

the

of
the
embryonic

now
consists
throughout
of
two
layers
of
cells
the
ectoderm
without

the
entoderm
within
it
is
only
in
the
centre
of
the
circular

which
becomes
thicker
and
thicker
through
the
growth
of
the
middle
layers

it
is
made
up
of
all
four
layers

are
deposited
on
the
surface
of
the
outer

which
has
been
raised
above
the
embryonic

figs
we
may
now
disregard
both
the
outer
ovolemma
and
the
greater
part
of
the
vesicle
and
concentrate
our
attention
on
the
germinative
area
and
the
embryonic
disk
it
is
here
alone
that
we
find
the
important
changes
which
lead
to
the
differentiation
of
the
first
organs
it
is
immaterial
whether
we
examine
the
germinative
area
of
the
mammal
the
rabbit
for
instance
or
the
germinal
disk
of
a
bird
or
a
reptile
such
as
a
lizard
or
tortoise
the
embryonic
processes
we
are
now
going
to
consider
are
essentially
the
same
in
all
members
of
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
which
we
call
the
amniotes
man
is
found
to
agree
in
this
respect
with

and
in
all
these
animals
the
germinative

undergoes
essentially
the

changes
as
in
the
birds

they
are
most
frequently

accurately
studied
in

can
have

that

behind

will
be
made
clearer
by
the

an
early

an
opaque

is
seen
in
the

passes
from

to
a
fatal
confusion

explain
very
clearly
the
real
significance
of
these
important
embryonic
parts
of
the
amniote
it
will
be
useful
to
do
so
in
a
series
of
formal
principles
the
trace
of
the

the
amniotes

the
embryonic
shield
in
the
centre
of
the
pellucid

consists
merely
of
an
early
differentiation
and
formation
of
the
middle
dorsal
parts
hence
the
best
name
for
it
is
dorsal
shield
as
i
proposed
long
ago
the
germinative
area
in
which
the
first
embryonic
appear
at
an
early
stage
is
not
opposed
as
an
external
area
to
the
proper
but
is
a
part
of
it
in
the
same
way
the
or
the
umbilical
vesicle
is
not
a
foreign
external
appendage
of
the
embryo
but
an
outlying
part
of
its
primitive
gut
the
dorsal
shield
gradually
separates
from
the
germinative
area
and
the
its
edges
growing
downwards
and
folding
together
to
form
ventral
plates
the
and
vessels
of
the
germinative
area
which
soon
spread
over
its
whole
surface
are
therefore
real
embryonic
organs
or
temporary
parts
of
the
embryo
and
have
a
transitory
importance
in
connection
with
the
nutrition
of
the
growing
later
body
the
latter
may
be
called
the
in
contrast
to
them
the
relation
of
these
cenogenetic
features
of
the
amniotes
to
the
palingenetic
structures
of
the
older
vertebrates
may
be
expressed
in
the
following
theses

original
gastrula
which
completely
passes
into
the
embryonic
body
in
the
acrania
cyclostoma

amphibia

early
divided
into

parts

outline

body

the
temporary
embryonic
organs
of
the
germinative
area

its
which
soon
grow
over
the
whole
of
the
the
differences
which
we
find
in
the
various
classes
of
the
vertebrate
stem
in
these
important
particulars

only
be
fully
understood

relations

one
hand

cenogenetic
modifications

have
been

these
are
the
changes
we

now
going
to

more
closely

of
the

the

are
much
modified
cenogenetically
this
prostoma
is
lengthened
so
much
that
it
soon
traverses
the
whole
of
the
hinder
half
of
the
dorsal

we
find
in
a

six

eight

developed
from
the
broader

the

in
this

the

a
median

makes
its
appearance

this

we
know

the
important

the

are
totally
different

the

to
a

to
be
merely
the

of

they
were
formerly
always
confused
this
error
was
the
more
pardonable
as
immediately
afterwards
the
two

do
actually
pass
into
each
other
in
a
very
remarkable
way
the
point

transition

the

the

very
plainly

this

can
not

at

here
the

travels
completely
over

of

is
converted

like

either
not
distinguish
them
at

only
by

quite
subordinate
peculiarities
in
the

moreover
the

can
not
at

stage
be
distinguished
from
those
of

mammals

it
particularly
resembles
that
of
the

hand
the
outer
form
of
these
flat

is
very
different
from
the
corresponding
form
of
the
lower
animals

the
acrania

nevertheless
the
body
is
just
the
same
in
the
essential
features
of
its
structure
as
that
we
find
in
the
chordula
of
the
latter
figs
and
in
the
embryonic
forms
which
immediately
develop
from
it
the
striking
external
difference
is
here
again
due
to
the
fact
that
in
the
palingenetic
embryos
of
the
amphioxus
figs
and
the
amphibia
figs
the
and
form
closed
tubes
from
the
first
whereas
in

are
forced
to
expand
on
the
surface
owing
to
the
great
extension
of
the
it
is
all
the
more
notable
that
the
early
separation
of
dorsal
and
ventral
halves
takes
place
in
the
same
rigidly
hereditary
fashion
in
all
the
vertebrates
in
both
the

the
dorsal
body
is
about
this
period
separated
from
the
ventral

this
division
has
already
taken
place

in

see
presently
that
in
the
light
of
the
theory

it
is
a
thoroughly
natural
process
the
phylogenetic
explanation

that

the
organ

which
all
intercourse
with

all
psychic

groove
grows
into
the
medullary
tube
the
layer
fig
which
lies
on
the
layer
naturally
follows
it
in
its
folding
moreover
the
incipient
consists
from
the
first
of
two
layers
internally
the
layer
and
externally
the
layer
the
formation
of
the
alimentary
canal
resembles
that
of
the
medullary
tube
to
this
both
cases
a
straight
groove
or
furrow
arises
first
of
all
in
the
middle
line
of
a
flat
layer
the
edges
of
this
furrow
then
bend
towards
each
other
and
join
to
form
a
tube
fig
but
the
two
processes
are
really
very
different
the
medullary
tube
closes
in
its
whole
length
and
forms
a
cylindrical
tube
whereas
the
alimentary
canal
remains
open
in
the
middle
and
its
cavity
continues
for
a
long
time
in
connection
with
the
cavity
of
the
embryonic
vesicle
the
open
connection
between
the
two
cavities
is
only
closed
at
a
very
late
stage
by
the
construction
of
the
navel
the
closing
of
the
medullary
tube
is
effected
from
both
sides
the
edges
of
the
groove
joining
together
from
right
and
left
but
the
closing
of
the
alimentary
canal
is
not
only
effected
from
right
and
left
but
also
from
front
and
rear
the
edges
of
the
ventral
groove
growing
together
from
every
side
towards
the
navel
throughout
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
the
whole
of
this
process
of
the
construction
of
the
gut
is
closely
connected
with
the
formation
of
the
navel
or
with
the
separation
of
the
embryo
from
the
or
umbilical
vesicle
in
order
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
this
we
must
understand
carefully
the
relation
of
the
embryonic
shield
to
the
germinative
area
and
the
embryonic
vesicle
this
is
done
best
by
a
comparison
of
the
five
stages
which
are
shown
in
longitudinal
section
in
figs
the
embryonic
shield
which
at
first
projects
very
slightly
over
the
surface
of
the
germinative
area
soon
begins
to
rise
higher
above
it
and
to
separate
from
the
embryonic
vesicle
at
this
point
the
embryonic
shield
looked
at
from
the
dorsal
surface
shows
still
the
original
simple
figs
we
do
not
yet
see
any
trace
of
articulation
into
head
neck
trunk
or
limbs
but
the
embryonic
shield
has
increased
greatly
in
thickness
especially
in
the
anterior
part
it
now
has
the
appearance
of
a
thick
oval
swelling
strongly
curved
over
the
surface
of
the
germinative
area
it
begins
to
sever
completely
from
the
embryonic
vesicle
with
which
it
is
connected
at
the
ventral
surface
as
this
severance
proceeds
the
back
bends
more
and
more
in
proportion
as
the
embryo
grows
the
embryonic
vesicle
decreases
and
at
last
it
merely
hangs
as
a
small
vesicle
from
the
belly
of
the
embryo
fig
in
consequence
of
the
which
cause
this
severance
a
depression
is
formed
at
the
surface
of

vesicle

surrounds

the
articulation
of
the
body
the
term
articulation
is
used
in
this
chapter
to
denote
both
and
in
the
ordinary
the
vertebrate
stem
to
which
our
race
belongs
as
one
of
the
latest
and
most
advanced
outcomes
of
the
natural
development
of
life
is
rightly
placed
at
the
head
of
the
animal
kingdom
this
privilege
must
be
accorded
to
it
not
only
because
man
does
in
point
of
fact
soar
far
above
all
other
animals
and
has
been
lifted
to
the
position
of
of
but
also
because
the
vertebrate
organism
far
surpasses
all
the
other
in
size
in
complexity
of
structure
and
in
the
advanced
character
of
its
functions
from
the
point
of
view
of
both
anatomy
and
physiology
the
vertebrate
stem
outstrips
all
the
other
or
invertebrate
animals
there
is
only
one
among
the
twelve
stems
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
can
in
many
respects
be
compared
with
the
vertebrates
and
reaches
an
equal
if
not
a
greater
importance
in
many
points
this
is
the
stem
of
the
articulates
composed
of
three
classes
the
annelids
leeches
and
cognate
forms
the
crustacea
crabs
etc
the
tracheata
spiders
insects
the
stem
of
the
articulates
is
superior
not
only
to
the
vertebrates
but
to
all
other
in
variety
of
forms
number
of
species
elaborateness
of
individuals
and
general
importance
in
the
economy
of
nature
when
we
have
thus
declared
the
vertebrates
and
the
articulates
to
be
the
most
important
and
most
advanced
of
the
twelve
stems
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
question
arises
whether
this
special
position
is
accorded
to
them
on
the
ground
of
a
peculiarity
of
organisation
that
is
common
to
the
two
the
answer
is
that
this
is
really
the
case
it
is
their
segmental
or
transverse
articulation
which
we
may
briefly
call
metamerism
in
all
the
vertebrates
and
articulates
the
developed
individual
consists
of
a
series
of
successive
members
segments
or
metamera
in
the
embryo
these
are
called
primitive
segments
or
somites
in
each
of
these
segments
we
have
a
certain
group
of
organs
reproduced
in
the
same
arrangement
so
that
we
may
regard
each
segment
as
an
individual
unity
or
a
special
subordinated
to
the
entire
personality
the
similarity
of
their
segmentation
and
the
consequent
physiological
advance
in
the
two
stems
of
the
vertebrates
and
articulates
has
led
to
the
assumption
of
a
direct
affinity
between
them
and
an
attempt
to
derive
the
former
directly
from
the
latter
the
annelids
were
supposed
to
be
the
direct
ancestors
not
only
of
the
crustacea
and
tracheata
but
also
of
the
vertebrates
we
shall
see
later
chapter
xx
that
this
annelid
theory
of
the
vertebrates
is
entirely
wrong
and
ignores
the
most
important
differences
in
the
organisation
of
the
two
stems
the
internal
articulation
of
the
vertebrates
is
just
as
profoundly
different
from
the
external
metamerism
of
the
articulates
as
are
their
skeletal
structure
nervous
system
vascular
system
and
so
on
the
articulation
has
been
developed
in
a
totally
different
way
in
the
two
stems
the
unarticulated
chordula
figs
which
we
have
recognised
as
one
of
the
chief
palingenetic
embryonic
forms
of
the
vertebrate
group
and
from
which
we
have
inferred
the
existence
of
a
corresponding
ancestral
form
for
all
the
vertebrates
and
tunicates
is
quite
unthinkable
as
the
of
the
articulates
all
articulated
animals
came
originally
from
unarticulated
ones
this
phylogenetic
principle
is
as
firmly
established
as
the
ontogenetic
fact
that
every
articulated
develops
from
an
unarticulated
embryo
but
the
organisation
of
the
embryo
is
totally
different
in
the
two
stems
the
of
all
the
vertebrates
is
characterised
by
the
dorsal
medullary
tube
the
neurenteric
canal
which
passes
at
the
primitive
mouth
into
the
alimentary
canal
and
the
axial
chorda
between
the
two
none
of
the
articulates
either
annelids
or
arthropods
crustacea
and
tracheata
show
any
trace
of
this
type
of
organisation
moreover
the
development
of
the
chief
systems
of
organs
proceeds
in
the
opposite
way
in
the
two
stems
hence
the
segmentation
must
have
arisen
independently
in
each
this
is
not
at
all
surprising
we
find
analogous
cases
in
the
of
the
higher
plants
and
in
several
groups
of
other
animal
stems
the
characteristic
internal
articulation
of
the
vertebrates
and
its
importance
in
the
organisation
of
the
stem
are
best
seen
in
the
study
of
the
skeleton
its
chief
and
central
part
the
cartilaginous
or
bony
vertebral
column
affords
an
obvious
instance
of
vertebrate
metamerism
it
consists
of
a
series
of
cartilaginous
or
bony
pieces
which
have
long
been
known
as
or
each
vertebra
is
directly
connected
with
a
special
section
of
the
muscular
system
the
nervous
system
the
vascular
system
etc
thus
most
of
the
take
part
in
this
vertebration
but
we
saw
when
we
were
considering
our
own
vertebrate
character
in
chapter
xi
that
the
same
internal
articulation
is
also
found
in
the
lowest
primitive
vertebrates
the
acrania
although
here
the
whole
skeleton
consists
merely
of
the
simple
chorda
and
is
not
at
all
articulated
hence
the
articulation
does
not
proceed
primarily
from
the
skeleton
but
from
the
muscular
system
and
is
clearly
determined
by
the
more
advanced
of
the
primitive

it
is
therefore
wrong
to
describe
the

in

vertebrate

as
primitive
vertebræ
or
provertebræ
the
fact
that
they
have
been
so
called
for
some
time
has
led
to
much
error
and
misunderstanding
hence
we
shall
give
the
name
of
or
primitive
segments
to
these
if
the
latter
name
is
retained
at
all
it
should
only
be
used

the
the

the
somites
from
which
the
later
vertebra
does
actually
develop

begins
in
all

at
a
very
early
embryonic
stage

this
indicates
the
considerable
phylogenetic

of
the
process
when
the

is
impossible
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
this
remarkable
agreement
in
the
chief
embryonic
features
in
man
and
the
other
animals
we
shall
make
use
of
it
later
on
for
our
monophyletic
theory
of
hypothesis
of
a
common
descent
of
man

all
the
metazoa
from
the
gastræa
the
first
rudiments
of
the
principal
parts
of
the
body
especially
the
oldest
organ
the
alimentary
canal
are
the
same
everywhere
they
have
always
the
same
extremely
simple
form
all
the
peculiarities
that
distinguish
the
various
groups
of
animals
from
each
other
only
appear
gradually
in
the
course
of
embryonic
development
and
the
closer
the
relation
of
the
various
groups
the
later
they
are
found
we
may
formulate
this
phenomenon
in
a
definite
law
which
may
in
a
sense
be
regarded
as
an
appendix
to
our
biogenetic
law
this
is
the
law
of
the
ontogenetic
connection
of
related
animal
forms
it
runs
the
closer
the
relation
of
two
animals
in
respect
of
their
whole
bodily
structure
and
the
nearer
they
are
connected
in
the
classification
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
longer
do
their
embryonic
forms
retain
their
identity
and
the
longer
is
it
impossible
or
only
possible
on
the
ground
of
subordinate
features
to
distinguish
between
their
embryos
this
law
applies
to
all
animals
whose
embryonic
development
is
in
the
main
an
hereditary
summary
of
their
ancestral
history
or
in
which
the
original
form
of
development
has
been
faithfully
preserved
by
heredity
when
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
altered
by
cenogenesis
or
disturbance
of
development
we
find
a
limitation
of
the
law
which
increases
in
proportion
to
the
introduction
of
new
features
by
adaptation
cf
chapter
i
pp
thus
the
apparent
exceptions
to
the
law
can
always
be

the
structural
identity
of
the

the

possesses
all
the
distinctive
features
of
the
ovum
of
the
viviparous
mammals
especially
the
characteristic
formation
of
its
membrane
which
clearly
distinguishes
it
from
the
ovum
of
all
other
animals
when
the
human
fœtus
has
attained
the
age
of
fourteen
days
it
forms
a
round
vesicle

about
a

can
at

most
be
distinguished

even
at

the

differs
very
little
from
that
of

the
features
by

we
distinguish

are

we
can

still
closely
resembles

the

cf
chapter

in

various
orders
of

the
placenta
undergoes
many
modifications

these
are
in
part
of
great
evolutionary
importance
and
useful
in
classification
there
is
only
one
of
these
that
need
be
specially
important
fact
established
by
selenka
in
that
the
distinctive
human
placentation
is
confined
to
the
anthropoids
in
this
most
advanced
group
of
the
mammals
the
allantois
is
very
small
soon
loses
its
cavity

then
in
common
with
the
amnion
undergoes
certain
peculiar
changes
the
umbilical
cord
develops
in
this
case
from
what
is
called
the
until
very
recently
this
was
regarded
as
a
structure
peculiar
to
man
we
now
know
from
selenka
that
the
ventral
pedicle
is
merely
the
pedicle
of
the
allantois
combined
with
the
pedicle
of
the

the
rudimentary

it
has
just
the

structure
in
the
orang

gibbon

very
probably
in
the
chimpanzee

as
in

it
is
therefore
not
a
but
a
striking
fresh
proof
of
the
of
man

the
anthropoid
apes

find
only
in
the
anthropoid

peculiar
and
elaborate
formation
of
the

that
characterises
man

in
this
case
there
is
at
an
early
stage
an
intimate
blending
of

in

it

impossible
to
separate
them

they
form
together

it

it
is
perforated

the
chief
consequence
of
which

descent
of

lately
been
confirmed
in
an
interesting
and
unexpected
way
from
the
side
of
the
experimental
physiology
of
the

the
experiments
of
hans
friedenthal
at

have
shown
that
human
blood
mixed
with
the
blood
of
lower
apes
has
a
poisonous
effect
on
the
latter
the
serum
of
the
one
destroys
the
of
the
other
but
this
does
not
happen
when
human
blood
is
mixed
with
that
of
the
anthropoid
ape
as
we
know
from
many
other
experiments
that
the
mixture
of

different
kinds
of
blood
is
only
possible
without
injury
in
the
case
of

closely
related
animals

whether

an
idle

this

finds

of

which
we
have
fully
considered
in
the
first
chapter
according
to
this
biogenetic
law

is
a
brief
and
condensed
recapitulation
of
phylogeny
if
this
compendious
reproduction
were
complete
in
all
cases
it
would
be
very
easy
to
construct
the
whole
story
of
evolution
on
an
embryonic
basis
when
we
wanted
to
know
the
ancestors
of
any
higher
organism
and
therefore
of
know
from
what
forms
the
race
as
a
whole
has
been
evolved
we
should
merely
have
to
follow
the
series
of
forms
in
the
development
of
the
individual
from
the
ovum
we
could
then
regard
each
of
the
successive
forms
as
the
representative
of
an
extinct
ancestral
form
however
this
direct
application
of
ontogenetic
facts
to
phylogenetic
ideas
is
possible
without
limitations
only
in
a
very
small
section
of
the
animal
kingdom
there
are
it
is
true
still
a
number
of
lower
invertebrates
for
instance
some
of
the
zoophyta
and
vermalia
in
which
we
are
justified
in
recognising
at
once
each
embryonic
form
as
the
historical
reproduction
or
silhouette
as
it
were
of
an
extinct
ancestor
but
in
the
great
majority
of
the
animals
and
in
the
case
of
man
this
is
impossible
because
the
embryonic
forms
themselves
have
been
modified
through
the
change
of
the
conditions
of
existence
and
have
lost
their
original
character
to
some
extent
during
the
immeasurable
course
of
organic
history
the
many
millions
of
years
during
which
life
was
developing
on
our
planet
secondary
changes
of
the
embryonic
forms
have
taken
place
in
most
animals
the
young
of
animals
not
only
detached
larvæ
but
also
the
embryos
enclosed
in
the
womb
may
be
modified
by
the
influence
of
the
environment
just
as
well
as
the
mature
organisms
are
by
adaptation
to
the
conditions
of
life
even
species
are
altered
during
the
embryonic
development
moreover
it
is
an
advantage
for
all
higher
organisms
and
the
advantage
is
greater
the
more
advanced
they
are
to
curtail
and
simplify
the
original
course
of
development
and
thus
to
obliterate
the
traces
of
their
ancestors
the
higher
the
individual
organism
is
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
less
completely
does
it
reproduce
in
its
embryonic
development
the
series
of
its
ancestors
for
reasons
that
are
as
yet
only
partly
known
to
us
the
fact
is
easily
proved
by
comparing
the
different
developments
of
higher
and
lower
animals
in
any
single
stem
in
order
to
appreciate
this
important
feature
we
have
distributed
the
embryological
phenomena
in
two
groups
and
under
palingenesis
we
count
those
facts
of
embryology
that
we
can
directly
regard
as
a
faithful
synopsis
of
the
corresponding
by
cenogenesis
we
understand
those
embryonic
processes
which
we
can
not
directly
correlate
with
corresponding
evolutionary
processes
but
must
regard
as
modifications
or
falsifications
of
them
with
this
careful
discrimination
between
palingenetic
and
cenogenetic
phenomena
our
biogenetic
law

the
following
more
precise
shape

and
brief

of
the

is
a
condensed
synopsis
of
the
long
and
slow
history
of

phylogeny
this
synopsis
is
the
more
faithful
and
complete
in
proportion
as
the
original
features
have
been
preserved
by
heredity
and
modifications
have
not
been
introduced
by
adaptation
in
order
to
distinguish
correctly
between
palingenetic
and
cenogenetic
phenomena
in
embryology
and
deduce
sound
conclusions
in
connection
with
we
must
especially
make
a
comparative
study
of
the
former
in
doing
this
it
is
best
to
employ
the
methods
that
have
long
been
used
by
geologists
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
succession
of
the
sedimentary
rocks
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
this
solid
crust
which
encloses
the
glowing
central
mass
like
a
thin
shell
is
composed
of
different
kinds
of
rocks
there
are
firstly
the
volcanic
rocks
which
were
formed
directly
by
the
cooling
at
the
surface
of
the
molten
mass
of
the
earth
secondly
there
are
the
sedimentary
rocks
that
have
been
made
out
of
the
former
by
the
action
of
water
and
have
been
laid
in
successive
strata
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
each
of
these
sedimentary
strata
was
at
first
a
soft
layer
of
mud
but
in
the
course
of
thousands
of
years
it
condensed
into
a
solid
hard
mass
of
stone
sandstone
limestone
marl
etc
and
at
the
same
time
permanently
preserved
the
solid
and
imperishable
bodies
that
had
chanced
to
fall
into
the
soft
mud
among
these
bodies
which
were
either
fossilised
or
left
characteristic
impressions
of
their
forms
in
the
soft
slime
we
have
especially
the
more
solid
parts
of
the
animals
and
plants
that
lived
and
died
during
the
deposit
of
the
slimy
strata
hence
each
of
the
sedimentary
strata
has
its
characteristic
fossils
the
remains
of
the
animals
and
plants
that
lived
during
that
particular
period
of
the
history
when
we
make
a
comparative
study
of
these
strata
we
can
survey
the
whole
series
of
such
periods
all
geologists
are
now
agreed
that
we
can
demonstrate
a
definite
historical
succession
in
the
strata
and
that
the
lowest
of
them
were
deposited
in
very
remote
and
the
uppermost
in
comparatively
recent
times
however
there
is
no
part
of
the
earth
where
we
find
the
series
of
strata
in
its
entirety
or
even
approximately
complete
the
succession
of
strata
and
of
corresponding
historical
periods
generally
given
in
geology
is
an
ideal
construction
formed
by
piecing
together
the
various
partial
discoveries
of
the
succession
of
strata
that
have
been
made
at
different
points
of
the
surface
cf
chapter
xviii
we
must
act
in
this
way
in
constructing
the
phylogeny
of
man
we
must
try
to
piece
together
a
fairly
complete
picture
of
the
series
of
our
ancestors
from
the
various
phylogenetic
fragments
that
we
find
in
the
different
groups
of
the
animal
kingdom
we
shall
see
that
we
are
really
in
a
position
to
form
an
approximate
picture
of
the
evolution
of
man
and
the
mammals
by
a
proper
comparison
of
the
embryology
of
very
different
picture
that
we
could
never
have
framed
from
the
ontogeny
of
the
mammals
alone
as
a
result
of
the
cenogenetic
of
disturbed
and
curtailed
series
of
lower
stages
have
dropped
out
in
the
embryonic
development
of
man
and
the
other
mammals
especially
from
the
earliest
periods
or
been
falsified
by
modification
but
we
find
these
lower
stages
in
their
original
purity
in
the
lower
vertebrates
and
their
invertebrate
ancestors
especially
in
the
lowest
of
all
the
vertebrates
the
lancelet
or
amphioxus
we
have
the
oldest
completely
preserved
in
the
embryonic
development
we
also
find
important
evidence
in
the
fishes
which
stand
between
the
lower
and
higher
vertebrates
and
throw
further
light
on
the
course
of
evolution
in
certain
periods
next
to
the
fishes
come
the
amphibia
from
the
embryology
of
which
we
can
also
draw
instructive
conclusions
they
represent
the
transition
to
the
higher
vertebrates
in
which
the
middle
and
older
stages
of
ancestral
development
have
been
either
distorted
or
curtailed
but
in
which
we
find
the
more
recent
stages
of
the
phylogenetic
process
well
preserved
in
ontogeny
we
are
thus
in
a
position
to
form
a
fairly
complete
idea
of
the
past
development
of
ancestors
within
the
vertebrate
stem
by
putting
together
and
comparing
the
embryological
developments
of
the
various
groups
of
vertebrates
and
when
we
go
below
the
lowest
vertebrates
and
compare
their
embryology
with
that
of
their
invertebrate
relatives
we
can
follow
the
genealogical
tree
of
our
animal
ancestors
much
farther
down
to
the
very
lowest
groups
of
animals
in
entering
the
obscure
paths
of
this
phylogenetic
labyrinth
clinging
to
the
of
the
biogenetic
law
and
guided
by
the
light
of
comparative
anatomy
we
will
first
in
accordance
with
the
methods
we
have
adopted
discover
and
arrange
those
fragments
from
the
manifold
embryonic
developments
of
very
different
animals
from
which
the
of
man
can
be
composed
i
would
call
attention
particularly
to
the
fact
that
we
can
employ
this
method
with
the
same
confidence
and
right
as
the
geologist
no
geologist
has
ever
had
ocular
proof
that
the
vast
rocks
that
compose
our
carboniferous
or
jurassic
or
cretaceous
strata
were
really
deposited
in
water
yet
no
one
doubts
the
fact
further
no
geologist
has
ever
learned
by
direct
observation
that
these
various
sedimentary
formations
were
deposited
in
a
certain
order
yet
all
are
agreed
as
to
this
order
this
is
because
the
nature
and
origin
of
these
rocks
can
not
be
rationally
understood
unless
we
assume
that
they
were
so
deposited
these
hypotheses
are
universally
received
as
safe
and
indispensable
theories
because
they
alone
give
a
rational
explanation
of
the
strata
our
evolutionary
hypotheses
can
claim
the
same
value
for
the
same
reasons
in
formulating
them
we
are
acting
on
the
same
inductive
and
deductive
methods
and
with
almost
equal
confidence
as
the
geologist
we
hold
them
to
be
correct
and
claim
the
status
of
for
them
because
we
can
not
understand
the
nature
and
origin
of
man
and
the
other
organisms
without
them
and
because
they
alone
satisfy
our
demand
for
a
knowledge
of
causes
and
just
as
the
geological
hypotheses
that
were
ridiculed
as
dreams
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
now
universally
admitted
so
our
phylogenetic
hypotheses
which
are
still
regarded
as
fantastic
in
certain
quarters
will
sooner
or
later
be
generally
received
it
is
true
that
as
will
soon
appear
our
task
is
not
so
simple
as
that
of
the
geologist
it
is
just
as
much
more
difficult
and
complex
as
organisation
is
more
elaborate
than
the
structure
of
the
rocks
when
we
approach
this
task
we
find
an
auxiliary
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
comparative
anatomy
and
embryology
of
two
lower
one
of
these
animals
is
the
lancelet
the
other
the
both
of
these
animals
are
very
instructive
both
are
at
the
border
between
the
two
chief
divisions
of
the
animal
vertebrates
and
invertebrates
the
vertebrates
comprise
the
already
mentioned
classes
from
the
amphioxus
to
man
acrania
lampreys
fishes
dipneusts
amphibia
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
following
the
example
of
lamarck
it
is
usual
to
put
all
the
other
animals
together
under
the
head
of
invertebrates
but
as
i
have
often
mentioned
already
the
group
is
composed
of
a
number
of
very
different
stems
of
these
we
have
no
interest
just
now
in
the
echinoderms
molluscs
and
articulates
as
they
are
independent
branches
of
the
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
vertebrates
on
the
other
hand
we
are
greatly
concerned
with
a
very
interesting
group
that
has
only
recently
been
carefully
studied
and
that
has
a
most
important
relation
to
the
ancestral
tree
of
the
vertebrates
this
is
the
stem
of
the
tunicates
one
member
of
this
group
the
very
closely
approaches
the
lowest
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
in
its
essential
internal
structure
and
embryonic
development
until
no
one
had
any
idea
of
the
close
connection
of
these
apparently
very
different
animals
it
was
a
very
fortunate
accident
that
the
embryology
of
these
related
forms
was
discovered
just
at
the
time
when
the
question
of
the
descent
of
the
vertebrates
from
the
invertebrates
came
to
the
front
in
order
to
understand
it
properly
we
must
first
consider
these
remarkable
animals
in
their
forms
and
compare
their
anatomy
we
begin
with
the
man
the
most
important
and
interesting
of
all
animals
man
is
at
the
highest
summit
the
lancelet
at
the
lowest
root
of
the
vertebrate
stem
it
lives
on
the
flat
sandy
parts
of
the
mediterranean
coast
partly
buried
in
the
sand
and
is
apparently
found
in
a
number
of
seas
it
has
been
found
in
the
north
sea
on
the
british
and
scandinavian
coasts
and
in
heligoland
and
at
various
places
on
the
mediterranean
for
instance
at
nice
naples
and
messina
it
is
also
found
on
the
coast
of
brazil
and
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
coast
of
peru
borneo
china
australia
recently
eight
to
ten
species
of
the
amphioxus
have
been
determined
distributed
in
two
or
three
genera
see
the
ample
monograph
by
arthur
willey
amphioxus
and
the
ancestry
of
the
boston
johannes
müller
classed
the
lancelet
with
the
fishes
although
he
pointed
out
that
the
differences
between
this
simple
vertebrate
and
the
lowest
fishes
are
much
greater
than
between
the
fishes
and
the
amphibia
but
this
was
far
from
expressing
the
real
significance
of
the
animal
we
may
confidently
lay
down
the
following
principle
the
amphioxus
differs
more
from
the
fishes
than
the
fishes
do
from
man
and
the
other
vertebrates
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
so
different
from
all
the
other
vertebrates
in
its
whole
organisation
that
the
laws
of
logical
classification
compel
us
to
distinguish
two
divisions
of
this
stem
the
acrania
amphioxus
and
its
extinct
relatives
and
the
craniota
man
and
the
other
vertebrates
the
first
and
lower
division
comprises
the
vertebrates
that
have
no
vertebræ
or
skull
of
these
the
only
living
representatives
are
the
amphioxus
and
paramphioxus

there
must
have
been
a

of

when
we
compare

we
may
say
that
the

in

best
seen
in

enclosing
a

however
the

end
is
a
little
rounder

contains
a
small
almost
imperceptible

be
regarded
as
the

we
sum
up
the
results

and
compare
them
with
the
familiar
organisation
of
man
we
shall
find
an
immense
distance
between
the
two
as
a
fact
the
highest
summit
of
the
vertebrate
organisation
which
man
represents
is
in
every
respect
so
far
above
the
lowest
stage
at
which
the
lancelet
remains
that
one
would
at
first
scarcely
believe
it
possible
to
class
both
animals
in
the
same
division
of
the
animal
kingdom
nevertheless
this
classification
is
indisputably
just
man
is
only
a
more
advanced
stage
of
the
vertebral
type
that
we
find
unmistakably
in
the
amphioxus
in
its
characteristic
features
we
need
only
recall
the
picture
of
the
ideal
primitive
vertebrate
given
in
a
former
chapter
and
compare
it
with
the
lower
stages
of
human
embryonic
development
to
convince
ourselves
of
our
close
relationship
to
the
lancelet
cf
chapter
xi
it
is
true
that
the
amphioxus
is
far
below
all
other
living
vertebrates
it
is
true
that
it
has
no
separate
head
no
developed
brain
or
skull
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
other
vertebrates
it
is
probably
as
a
result
of
degeneration
without
the
auscultory
organ
and
the
centralised
heart
that
all
the
others
have
and
it
has
no
kidneys
every
single
organ
in
it
is
simpler
and
less
advanced
than
in
any
of
the
others
yet
the
characteristic
connection
and
arrangement
of
all
the
organs
is
just
the
same
as
in
the
other
vertebrates
all
these
moreover
pass
during
their
embryonic
development
through
a
stage
in
which
their
whole
organisation
is
no
higher
than
that
of
the
amphioxus
but
is
substantially
identical
with
it

order
to
see
this
quite
clearly
it
is
particularly
useful
to
compare
the
amphioxus
with
the
youthful
forms
of
those
vertebrates
that
are
classified
next
to
it
this
is
the
class
of
the
cyclostoma
there
are
only
a
few
species
of
this
once
extensive
class
and
these
may
be
distributed
in
two
groups
one
group
comprises
the
or
myxinoides
the
other
group
are
the
petromyzontes
or
lampreys
which
are
a
familiar
delicacy
in
their
marine
form
these
cyclostoma
are
usually
classified
with
the
fishes
but
they
are
far
below
the
true
fishes
and
form
a
very
interesting
between
them
and
the
lancelet
one
can
see
how
closely
they
approach
the
latter
by
comparing
a
young
lamprey
with
the
amphioxus
the
chorda
is
of
the
same
simple
character
in
both
also
the
medullary
tube
that
lies
above
the
chorda
and
the
alimentary
canal
below
it
however
in
the
lamprey
the
spinal
cord
swells
in
front
into
a
simple
cerebral
vesicle
and
at
each
side
of
it
there
are
a
very
simple
eye
and
a
rudimentary
auditory
vesicle
the
nose
is
a
single
pit
as
in
the
amphioxus
the
two
sections
of
the
gut
are
also
just
the
same
and
very
rudimentary
in
the
lamprey
on
the
other
hand
we
see
a
great
advance
in
the
structure
of
the
heart
which
is
found
underneath
the
gills
in
the
shape
of
a
centralised
muscular
tube
and
is
divided
into
an
auricle
and
a
ventricle
later
on
the
lamprey
advances
still
further
and
gets
a
skull
five
cerebral
vesicles
a
series
of
independent
etc
this
makes
all
the
more
interesting
the
striking
resemblance
of
its
immature
larva
to
the
developed
and
sexually
mature
amphioxus
while
the
amphioxus
is
thus
connected
through
the
cyclostoma
with
the
fishes
and
so
with
the
series
of
the
higher
vertebrates
it
is
on
the
other
hand
very
closely
related
to
a
lowly
invertebrate
marine
animal
from
which
it
seems
to
be
entirely
remote
at
first
glance
this
remarkable
animal
is
the
or
ascidia
which
was
formerly
thought
to
be
closely
related
to
the
mussel
and
so
classed
in
the
molluscs
but
since
the
remarkable
embryology
of
these
animals
was
discovered
in
there
can
be
no
question
that
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
molluscs
to
the
great
astonishment
of
zoologists
they
were
found
in
their
whole
individual
development
to
be
closely
related
to
the
vertebrates
when
fully
developed
the
ascidiæ
are
shapeless
lumps
that
would
not
at
first
sight
be
taken
for
animals
at
all
the
oval
body
frequently
studded
with
knobs
or
uneven
and
lumpy
in
which
we
can
discover
no
special
external
organs
is
attached
at
one
end
to
marine
plants
rocks
or
the
floor
of
the
sea
many
species
look
like
potatoes
others
like
others
like
prunes
many
of
the
ascidiæ
form
transparent
crusts
or
deposits
on
stones
and
marine
plants
some
of
the
larger
species
are
eaten
like
oysters
fishermen
who
know
them
very
well
think
they
are
not
animals
but
plants
they
are
sold
in
the
fish
markets
of
many
of
the
italian
with
other
lower
marine
animals
under
the
name
of
di
there
is
nothing
about
them
to
show
that
they
are
animals
when
they
are
taken
out
of
the
water
with
the
net
the
most
one
can
perceive
is
a
slight
contraction
of
the
body
that
causes
water
to
spout
out
in
two
places
the
bulk
of
the
ascidiæ
are
very
small
at
the
most
a
few
inches
long
a
few
species
are
a
foot
or
more
in
length
there
are
many
species
of
them
and
they
are
found
in
every
sea
as
in
the
case
of
the
acrania
we
have
no
fossilised
remains
of
the
class
because
they
have
no
hard
and
fossilisable
parts
however
they
must
be
of
great
antiquity
and
must
go
back
to
the
primordial
epoch
the
name
of
is
given
to
the
whole
class
to
which
the
ascidiæ
belong
because
the
body
is
enclosed
in
a
thick
and
stiff
covering
like
a
mantle
this
soft
like
jelly
sometimes
as
tough
as
leather
and
sometimes
as
stiff
as
a
number
of
peculiarities
the
most
remarkable
of
them
is
that
it
consists
of
a
woody
matter
same
vegetal
substance
that
forms
the
stiff
envelopes
of
the
the
substance
of
the
wood
the
tunicates
are
the
only
class
of
animals
that
have
a
real
cellulose
or
woody
coat
sometimes
the
cellulose
mantle
is
brightly
coloured
at
other
times
colourless
not
infrequently
it
is
set
with
needles
or
hairs
like
a
cactus
often
we
find
a
mass
of
foreign
sand
fragments
of
into
the
mantle
this
has
earned
for
the
ascidia

name
of

the

is
pierced

by

of
regular
roots
the
dorsal
and
ventral
sides
differ
a
good
deal
internally
but
frequently
can
not
be
distinguished
externally
if
we
open
the
thick
tunic
or
mantle
in
order
to
examine
the
internal
organisation
we
first
find
a
spacious
cavity
filled
with
or
respiratory
cavity
fig
it
is
also
called
the
branchial
cavity
and
the
cloaca
because
it
receives
the
excrements
and
sexual
products
as
well
as
the
respiratory
water
the
greater
part
of
the
respiratory
cavity
is
occupied
by
the
large
grated
branchial
sac
this
is
so
like
the
of
the
amphioxus
in
its
whole
arrangement
that
the
resemblance
was
pointed
out
by
the
english
naturalist
goodsir
years
ago
before
anything
was
known
of
the
relationship
of
the
two
animals
as
a
fact
even
in
the
ascidia
the
mouth
opens
first
into
this
wide
branchial
sac
the
respiratory
water
passes
through
the
of
the
branchial
sac
into
the
branchial
cavity
and
is
ejected
from
this
by
the
respiratory
pore
along
the
ventral
side
of
the
branchial
sac
runs
a
ciliated
hypobranchial
groove
which
we
have
previously
found
at
the
same
spot
in
the
amphioxus
the
food
of
the
ascidia
also
consists
of
tiny
organisms
infusoria
diatoms

these
pass
with
the
water
into
the
and
the
digestive
part
of
the
gut
at
the
end
of
it
at
first
into
an
enlargement
of
it
that
represents
the
stomach
the
adjoining
small
intestine

forms
a
loop
bends
forward
and
opens
by
an

fig
not
directly
outwards
but
first
into
the

cavity
from
this
the
excrements
are
ejected
by
a
common
outlet
together
with
the
water
and
the
sexual
products
the
outlet
is
sometimes
called
the
branchial
pore
and
sometimes
the
cloaca
or
in
many
of
the
ascidiæ
a
glandular
mass
opens
into
the
gut
and
this
represents
the
liver
in
some
there
is
another
gland
besides
the
liver
and
this
is
taken
to
represent
the
kidneys
the
proper
or
cœloma
which
is
filled
with
blood
and
encloses
the
hepatic
gut
is
very
narrow

ascidia

in

slightly

under

connected
with
it
we
find
a
thin
muscle
tube
as
in
the
worms
on
the
other
hand
the
ascidia
has
a
centralised
heart
and
in
this
respect
it
seems
to
be
more
advanced
than
the
amphioxus
on
the
ventral
side
of
the
gut
some
distance
behind
the
there
is
a
heart
it
retains
permanently
the
simple
tubular
form
that
we
find
temporarily
as
the
first
structure
of
the
heart
in
the
vertebrates
this
simple
heart
of
the
ascidia
has
however
a
remarkable
peculiarity
it
contracts
in
alternate
directions
in
all
other
animals
the
beat
of
the
heart
is
always
in
the
same
direction
generally
from
rear
to
front
it
changes
in
the
ascidia
to
the
reverse
direction
the
heart
contracts
first
from
the
rear
to
the
front
stands
still
for
a
minute
and
then
begins
to
beat
the
opposite
way
now
driving
the
blood
from
front
to
rear
the
two
large
vessels
that
start
from
either
end
of
the
heart
act
alternately
as
arteries
and
veins
this
feature
is
found
in
the
tunicates
alone
of
the
other
chief
organs
we
have
still
to
mention
the
sexual
glands
which
lie
right
behind
in
the
all
the
ascidiæ
are
hermaphrodites
each
individual
has
a
male
and
a
female
gland
and
so
is
able
to
fertilise
itself
the
ripe
ova
fig
fall
directly
from
the
ovary
into
the
the
male
sperm
is
conducted
into
this
cavity
from
the
testicle
by
a
special
duct
fertilisation
is
accomplished
here
and
in
many
of
the
ascidiæ
developed
embryos
are
found
these
are
then
ejected
with
the
through
the
cloaca
and
so
if
we
now
glance
at
the
entire
structure
of
the
simple
ascidia
especially
cynthia
etc
and
compare
it
with
that
of
the
amphioxus
we
shall
find
that
the
two
have
few
points
of
contact
it
is
true
that
the
ascidia
resembles
the
amphioxus
in
several
important
features
of
its
internal
structure
and
especially
in
the
peculiar
character
of
the
and
gut
but
in
most
other
features
of
organisation
it
is
so
far
removed
from
it
and
is
so
unlike
it
in
external
appearance
that
the
really
close
relationship
of
the
two
was
not
discovered
until
their
embryology
was
studied
we
will
now
compare
the
embryonic
development
of
the
two
animals
and
find
to
our
great
astonishment
that
the
same
embryonic
form
develops
from
the
ovum
of
the
amphioxus
as
from
that
of
the
typical
chapter
xvii
embryology
of
the
lancelet
and
the
the
structural
features
that
distinguish
the
vertebrates
from
the
invertebrates
are
so
prominent
that
there
was
the
greatest
difficulty
in
the
earlier
stages
of
classification
in
determining
the
affinity
of
these
two
great
groups
when
scientists
began
to
speak
of
the
affinity
of
the
various
animal
groups
in
more
than
a
a
this
question
came
at
once
to
the
front
and
seemed
to
constitute
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
the
of
the
evolutionary
theory
even
earlier
when
they
had
studied
the
relations
of
the
chief
groups
without
any
idea
of
real
genealogical
connection
they
believed
they
had
found
here
and
there
among
the
invertebrates
points
of
contact
with
the
vertebrates
some
of
the
worms
especially
seemed
to
approach
the
vertebrates
in
structure
such
as
the
marine
but
on
closer
study
the
analogies
proved
untenable
when
darwin
gave
an
impulse
to
the
construction
of
a
real
of
the
animal
kingdom
by
his
reform
of
the
theory
of
evolution
the
solution
of
this
problem
was
found
to
be
particularly
difficult
when
i
made
the
first
attempt
in
my
to
work
out
the
theory
and
apply
it
to
classification
i
found
no
problem
of
phylogeny
that
gave
me
so
much
trouble
as
the
linking
of
the
vertebrates
with
the
invertebrates
but
just
at
this
time
the
true
link
was
discovered
and
at
a
point
where
it
was
least
expected
towards
the
end
of
two
works
of
the
russian
zoologist
kowalevsky
who
had
lived
for
some
time
at
naples
and
studied
the
embryology
of
the
lower
animals
were
issued
in
the
publications
of
the
petersburg
academy
a
fortunate
accident
had
directed
the
attention
of
this
able
observer
almost
simultaneously
to
the
embryology
of
the
lowest
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
and
that
of
an
invertebrate
the
close
affinity
of
which
to
the
amphioxus
had
been
least
suspected
the
ascidia
to
the
extreme
astonishment
of
all
zoologists
who
were
interested
in
this
important
question
there
turned
out
to
be
the
utmost
resemblance
in
structure
from
the
commencement
of
development
between
these
two
very
different
lowest
vertebrate
and
the
sessile
invertebrate
with
this
undeniable
identity
of
ontogenesis
which
can
be
demonstrated
to
an
astounding
extent
we
had
in
virtue
of
the
biogenetic
law
discovered
the
genealogical
link
and
definitely
identified
the
invertebrate
group
that
represents
the
nearest
of
the
vertebrates
the
discovery
was
confirmed
by
other
zoologists
and
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
that
of
all
the
classes
of
invertebrates
that
of
the
tunicates
is
most
closely
related
to
the
vertebrates
and
of
the
tunicates
the
nearest
are
the
ascidiæ
we
can
not
say
that
the
vertebrates
are
descended
from
the
still
less
the
we
can
say
that
of
all
the
invertebrates
it
is
the
tunicates
and
within
this
group
the
ascidiæ
that
are
the
nearest
of
the
ancient
of
the
vertebrates
we
must
assume
as
the
common
ancestral
group
of
both
stems
an
extinct
family
of
the
extensive
the
or
in
order
to
appreciate
fully
this
remarkable
fact
and
especially
to
secure
the
sound
basis
we
seek
for
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
vertebrates
it
is
necessary
to
study
thoroughly
the
embryology
of
both
these
animals
and
compare
the
individual
development
of
the
amphioxus
step
by
step
with
that
of
the
ascidia
we
begin
with
the
ontogeny
of
the
amphioxus
from
the
concordant
observations
of
kowalevsky
at
naples
and
hatschek
at
messina
it
follows
firstly
that
the
and
gastrulation
of
the
amphioxus
are
of
the
simplest
character
they
take
place
in
the
same
way
as
we
find
them
in
many
of
the
lower
animals
of
different
invertebrate
stems
which
we
have
already
described
as
original
or
primordial
the
development
of
the
ascidia
is
of
the
same
type
sexually
mature
specimens
of
the
amphioxus
which
are
found
in
great
quantities
at
messina
from
april
or
may
onwards
begin
as
a
rule
to
eject
their
sexual
products
in
the
evening
if
you
catch
them
about
the
middle
of
a
warm
night
and
put
them
in
a
glass
vessel
with
seawater
they
immediately
eject
through
the
mouth
their
accumulated
sexual
products
in
consequence
of
the
disturbance
the
males
give
out
masses
of
sperm
and
the
females
discharge
ova
in
such
quantity
that
many
of
them
stick
to
the
fibrils
about
their
mouths
both
kinds
of
cells
pass
first
into
the
after
the
opening
of
the
gonads
proceed
through
the
into
the
branchial
gut
and
are
discharged
from
this
through
the
mouth
the
ova
are
simply
round
cells
they
are
only
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
thus
are
only
half
the
size
of
the
mammal
ova
and
have
no
distinctive
features
the
clear
protoplasm
of
the
mature
ovum
is
made
so
turbid
by
the
numbers
of
dark
granules
of
or
deutoplasm
scattered
in
it
that
it
is
difficult
to
follow
the
process
of
fecundation
and
the
behaviour
of
the
two
nuclei
during
it
the
active
elements
of
the
male
sperm
the
spermatozoa
are
similar
to
those
of
most
other
animals
cf
fig
fecundation
takes
place
when
these
lively
ciliated
cells
of
the
sperm
approach
the
ovum
and
seek
to
penetrate
into
the
or
the
cellular
substance
of
the
ovum
with
their
thicker
part
of
the
cell
that
encloses
the
nucleus
only
one
spermatozoon
can
bore
its
way
into
the
yelk
at
one
pole
of
the
its
head
or
nucleus
coalesces
with
the
female
nucleus
which
remains
after
the
extrusion
of
the
directive
bodies
from
the
germinal
vesicle
thus
is
formed
the
or
the
nucleus
of
the
cytula
fig
this
now
undergoes
total
segmentation
dividing
into
two
four
eight
sixteen
cells
and
so
on
in
this
way
we
get
the
spherical
body
which
we
call
the
the
segmentation
of
the
amphioxus
is
not
entirely
regular
as
was
supposed
after
the
first
observations
of
kowalevsky
it
is
not
completely
equal
but
a
little
unequal
as
hatschek
afterwards
found
the
only
remain
equal
up
to
the
the
spherical
body
of
which
consists
of
cells
then
as
always
happens
in
unequal
segmentation
the
more
sluggish
vegetal
cells
are
outstripped
in
the
cleavage
at
the
lower
or
vegetal
pole
of
the
ovum
a
crown
of
eight
large
entodermic
cells
remains
for
a
long
time
unchanged
while
the
other
cells
divide
owing
to
the
formation
of
a
series
of
horizontal
circles
into
an
increasing
number
of
crowns
of
sixteen
cells
each
afterwards
the
get
more
or
less
irregularly
displaced
while
the
enlarges
in
the
centre
of
the
morula
in
the
end
the
former
all
lie
on
the
surface
of
the
latter
so
that
the
fœtus
attains
the
familiar
blastula
shape
and
forms
a
hollow
ball
the
wall
of
which
consists
of
a
single
stratum
of
cells
fig
this
layer
is
the
blastoderm
the
simple
epithelium
from
the
cells
of
which
all
the
tissues
of
the
body
proceed
these
important
early
embryonic
processes
take
place
so
quickly
in
the
amphioxus
that
four
or
five
hours
after
fecundation
or
about
midnight
the
spherical
blastula
is
completed
a
depression
is
then
formed
at
the
vegetal
pole
of
it
and
in
consequence
of
this
the
hollow
sphere
doubles
on
itself
fig
this
pit
becomes
deeper
and
deeper
fig
at
last
the
invagination
or
doubling
is
complete
and
the
inner
or
folded
part
of
the
lies
on
the
inside
of
the
outer
wall
we
thus
get
a
hollow
hemisphere
the
thin
wall
of
which
is
made
up
of
two
layers
of
cells
fig
from
hemispherical
the
body
soon
becomes
almost
spherical
once
more
and
then
oval
the
internal
cavity
enlarging
considerably
and
its
mouth
growing
narrower
fig
the
form
which
the
has
thus
reached
is
a
real
or
of
the
original
simple
type
that
we
have
previously
described
as
the
or
figs
as
in
all
the
other
animals
that
form
an
archigastrula
the
whole
body
is
nothing
but
a
simple
gastric
sac
or
stomach
its
internal
cavity
is
the
primitive
gut
or
archenteron
fig
and
its
aperture
the
primitive
mouth
or
the
wall
is
at
once
and
it
is
composed
of
two
simple
the
familiar
primary
germinal
layers
the
inner
layer
or
the
invaginated
part
of
the
blastoderm
which
immediately
encloses
the
is
the
entoderm
the
inner
or
vegetal
from
which
develop
the
wall
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
all
its
appendages
the
etc
figs
the
outer
stratum
of
cells
or
the
part
of
the
blastoderm
is
the
ectoderm
the
outer
or
animal
which
provides
the
outer
skin
epidermis
and
the
nervous
system
the
cells
of
the
entoderm
are
much
larger
darker
and
more
fatty
than
those
of
the
ectoderm
which
are
clearer
and
less
rich
in
fatty
particles
hence
before
and
during
invagination
there
is
an
increasing
differentiation
of
the
inner
from
the
outer
layer
the
animal
cells
of
the
outer
layer
soon
develop
vibratory
hairs
the
vegetal
cells
of
the
inner
layer
do
so
much
later
a
process
grows
out
of
each
cell
and
effects
continuous
vibratory
movements
by
the
vibrations
of
these
slender
hairs
the
gastrula
of
the
amphioxus
swims
about
in
the
sea
when
it
has
pierced
the
thin
ovolemma
like
the
gastrula
of
many
other
animals
fig
as
in
many
other
lower
animals
the
cells
have
only
one
hair
each
and
so
are
called
whip
cells
in
contrast
with
the
cells
which
have
a
number
of
short
lashes
or
cilia
in
the
further
course
of
its
rapid
development
the
roundish
becomes
elongated
and
begins
to
flatten
on
one
side
parallel
to
the
long
axis
the
flattened
side
is
the
subsequent
dorsal
side
the
opposite
or
ventral
side
remains
curved
the
latter
grows
more
quickly
than
the
former
with
the
result
that
the
primitive
mouth
is
forced
to
the
dorsal
side
fig
in
the
middle
of
the
dorsal
surface
a
shallow
longitudinal
groove
or
furrow
is
formed
fig
and
the
edges
of
the
body
rise
up
on
each
side
of
this
groove
in
the
shape
of
two
parallel
swellings
this
groove
is
of
course
the
dorsal
furrow
and
the
swellings
are
the
dorsal
or
medullary
swellings
they
form
the
first
structure
of
the
central
nervous
system
the
medullary
tube
the
medullary
swellings
now
rise
higher
the
groove
between
them
becomes
deeper
and
deeper
the
edges
of
the
parallel
swellings
curve
towards
each
other
and
at
last
unite
and
the
medullary
tube
is
formed
figs
hence
the
formation
of
a
medullary
tube
out
of
the
outer
skin
takes
place
in
the
naked
dorsal
surface
of
the
larva
of
the
amphioxus
in
just
the
same
way
as
we
have
found
in
the
embryo
of
man
and
the
higher
animals
within
the
fœtal
membranes
simultaneously
with
the
construction
of
the
medullary
tube
we
have
in
the
the
formation
of
the
chorda
the
and
the
mesoderm
proceeding
from
their
wall
these
processes
also
take
place
with
characteristic
simplicity
and
clearness
so
that
they
are
very
instructive
to
compare
with
the
vermalia
on
the
one
hand
and
with
the
higher
vertebrates
on
the
other
while
the
medullary
groove
is
sinking
in
the
middle
line
of
the
flat
dorsal
side
of
the
oval
embryo
and
its
parallel
edges
unite
to
form
the
ectodermic
neural
tube
the
single
chorda
is
formed
directly
underneath
them
and
on
each
side
of
this
a
parallel
longitudinal
fold
from
the
dorsal
wall
of
the
primitive
gut
these
longitudinal
folds
of
the
entoderm
proceed
from
the
primitive
mouth
or
from
its
lower
and
hinder
edge
here
we
see
at
an
early
stage
a
couple
of
large
entodermic
cells
which
are
distinguished
from
all
the
others
by
their
great
size
round
form
and
protoplasm
they
are
the
two
promesoblasts
or
polar
cells
of
the
mesoderm
fig
they
indicate
the
original
of
the
two
which
grow
from
this
spot
between
the
inner
and
outer
germinal
layers
sever
themselves
from
the
primitive
gut
and
provide
the
cellular
material
for
the
middle
layer
immediately
after
their
formation
the
two
of
the
amphioxus
are
divided
into
several
parts
by
longitudinal
and
transverse
folds
each
of
the
primary
pouches
is
divided
into
an
upper
dorsal
and
a
lower
ventral
section
by
a
couple
of
lateral
longitudinal
folds
fig
but
these
are
again
divided
by
several
parallel
transverse
folds
into
a
number
of
successive
sacs
the
primitive
segments
or
somites
formerly
called
by
the
unsuitable
name
of

have
a
different
future
above
and
below
the
upper
or
dorsal
segments

lose
their
cavity

their
cells

muscular
plates

the
trunk
the
lower
or
ventral
segments
the
corresponding
to
the
lateral
plates
of
the
fuse
together
in
the
upper
part
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
their
lateral
walls
and
thus
form
the
later
metacœl
in
the
lower
part
they
remain
separate
and
afterwards
form
the
segmental
gonads
in
the
middle
between
the
two
lateral
of
the
primitive
gut
a
single
central
organ
detaches
from
this
at
an
early
stage
in
the
middle
line
of
its
dorsal
wall
this
is
the
dorsal
chorda
figs
this
axial
rod
which
is
the
first
foundation
of
the
later
vertebral
column
in
all
the
vertebrates
and
is
the
only
representative
of
it
in
the
amphioxus
originates
from
the
entoderm
in
consequence
of
these
important
in
the
primitive
gut
the
simple
entodermic
tube
divides
into
four
different
sections

side
the
permanent

partly
unite

the
neural
or
medullary
tube
is
formed
above
the
chorda
on
the
dorsal
surface
by
the
closing
of
the
parallel
medullary
swellings
all
these
processes
which
outline
the
typical
structure
of
the
vertebrate
take
place
with
astonishing
rapidity
in
the
embryo
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
or
hours
after
fertilisation
the
young
vertebrate
the
typical
embryo
is
formed
it
then
has
as
a
rule
six
to
eight
somites
the
chief
occurrence
on
the
second
day
of
development
is
the
construction
of
the
two
permanent
openings
of
the
mouth
and
anus
in
the
earlier
stages
the
alimentary
tube
is
found
to
be
entirely
closed
after
the
closing
of
the
primitive
mouth
it
only
communicates
behind
by
the
neurenteric
canal
with
the
medullary
tube
the
permanent
mouth
is
a
secondary
formation
at
the
opposite
end
here
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
we
find
a
depression
in
the
outer
skin
which
penetrates
inwards
into
the
closed
gut
the
anus
is
formed
behind
in
the
same
way
a
few
hours
later
in
the
vicinity
of
the
additional
in
man
and
the
higher
vertebrates
also
the
mouth
and
anus
are
formed
as
we
have
seen
as
flat
pits
in
the
outer
skin
they
then
penetrate
inwards
gradually
becoming
connected
with
the
blind
ends
of
the
closed
during
the
second
day
the
undergoes
few
other
changes
the
number
of
primitive
segments
increases
and
generally
amounts
to
fourteen
some
to
fifty
hours
after
impregnation
almost
simultaneously
with
the
formation
of
the
mouth
the
first
breaks
through
in
the
fore
section
of
the
generally
forty
hours
after
the
commencement
of
development
it
now
begins
to
nourish
itself
independently
as
the
food
material
stored
up
in
the
ovum
is
completely
used
up
the
further
development
of
the
free
larvæ
takes
place
very
slowly
and
extends
over
several
months
the
body
becomes
much
longer
and
is
compressed
at
the
sides
the
being
broadened
in
a
sort
of
triangle
two
rudimentary
are
developed
in
it
inside
we
find
the
first
an
upper
or
dorsal
vessel
corresponding
to
the
aorta
between
the
gut
and
the
dorsal
cord
and
a
lower
or
ventral
vessel
corresponding
to
the
subintestinal
vein
at
the
lower
border
of
the
gut
now
the
gills
or
respiratory
organs
also
are
formed
at
the
of
the
alimentary
canal
the
whole
of
the
anterior
or
respiratory
section
of
the
gut
is
converted
into
a
which
is
pierced
by
numbers
of
as
in
the
ascidia
this
is
done
by
the
foremost
part
of
the
joining
with
the
outer

we

the

undergoes
various
modifications

in

these
modifications
do
not
concern
us

they
depend
on
special
adaptations
and
do
not
affect

the
is

it
has
substantially
the

structure
as
the

as
regards
the
remaining
organs
of
the
amphioxus
we
need
only
mention
that
the
gonads
or

are
developed
very
late
immediately
out
of

fig
for
the
rest
the
subsequent
development
into
the
adult
amphioxus
of
the
larva
we
have
followed
is
so
simple
that
we
need
not
go
further
into
it
here
we
may
now
turn
to
the
embryology
of
the
ascidia
an
animal
that
seems
to
stand
so
much
lower
and
to
be
so
much
more
simply
organised
remaining
for
the
greater
part
of
its
life
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
like
a
shapeless
lump
it
was
a
fortunate
accident
that
kowalevsky
first
examined
just
those
larger
specimens
of
the
ascidiæ
that
show
most
clearly
the
relationship
of
the
vertebrates
to
the
invertebrates
and
the
larvæ
of
which
behave
exactly
like
those
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
first
stages
of
development
this
resemblance
is
so
close
in
the
main
features
that
we
have
only
to
repeat
what
we
have
already
said
of
the
ontogenesis
of
the
amphioxus
the
ovum
of
the
larger
ascidia
cynthia
etc
is
a
simple
round
cell
of
to
of
an
inch
in
diameter
in
the
thick
yelk
we
find
a
clear
round
germinal
vesicle
of
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
this
encloses
a
small
embryonic
spot
or
nucleolus
inside
the
membrane
that
surrounds
the
ovum
the
of
the
ascidia
after
fecundation
passes
through
just
the
same
metamorphoses
as
the
of
the
amphioxus
it
undergoes
total
segmentation
it
divides
into
two
four
eight
sixteen
cells
and
so
on
by
continued
total
cleavage
the
morula
or
cluster
of
cells
is
formed
fluid
gathers
inside
it
and
thus
we
get
once
more
a
globular
vesicle
the
blastula
the
wall
of
this
is
a
single
stratum
of
cells
the
blastoderm
a
real
gastrula
a
simple
is
formed
from
the
blastula
by
invagination
in
the
same
way
as
in
the
amphioxus
up
to
this
there
is
no
definite
ground
in
the
embryology
of
the
ascidiæ
for
bringing
them
into
close
relationship
with
the
vertebrates
the
same
gastrula
is
formed
in
the
same
way
in
many
other
animals
of
different
stems
but
we
now
find
an
embryonic
process
that
is
peculiar
to
the
vertebrates
and
that
proves
irrefragably
the
affinity
of
the
ascidiæ
to
the
vertebrates
from
the
epidermis
of
the
gastrula
a
is
formed
on
the
dorsal
side
and
between
this
and
the
primitive
gut
a
these
are
the
organs
that
are
otherwise
only
found
in
vertebrates
the
formation
of
these
very
important
organs
takes
place
in
the
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
in
that
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
ascidia
as
in
the
other
case
the
oval
gastrula
is
first
flattened
on
one
subsequent
dorsal
side
a
groove
or
furrow
the
medullary
groove
is
sunk
in
the
middle
line
of
the
flat
surface
and
two
parallel
longitudinal
swellings
arise
on
either
side
from
the
skin
layer
these
medullary
swellings
join
together
over
the
furrow
and
form
a
tube
in
this
case
again
the
neural
or
medullary
tube
is
at
first
open
in
front
and
connected
with
the
primitive
gut
behind
by
the
neurenteric
canal
further
in
the
also
the
two
permanent
apertures
of
the
alimentary
canal
only
appear
later
as
independent
and
new
formations
the
permanent
mouth
does
not
develop
from
the
primitive
mouth
of
the
gastrula
this
primitive
mouth
closes
up
and
the
later
anus
is
formed
near
it
by
invagination
from
without
on
the
hinder
end
of
the
body
opposite
to
the
aperture
of
the
medullary
tube
during
these
important
processes
that
take
place
in
just
the
same
way
in
the
amphioxus
a
projection
grows
out
of
the
posterior
end
of
the
and
the
larva
folds
itself
up
within
the
round
ovolemma
in
such
a
way
that
the
dorsal
side
is
curved
and
the
tail
is
forced
on
to
the
ventral
side
in
this
tail
is
from
the
primitive
cylindrical
string
of
cells
the
fore
end
of
which
pushes
into
the
body
of
the
larva
between
the
alimentary
canal
and
the
neural
canal
and
is
no
other
than
the
chorda
dorsalis
this
important
organ
had
hitherto
been
found
only
in
the
vertebrates
not
a
single
trace
of
it
being
discoverable
in
the
invertebrates
at
first
the
chorda
only
consists
of
a
single
row
of
large
entodermic
cells
it
is
afterwards
composed
of
several
rows
of
cells
in
the
also
the
chorda
develops
from
the
dorsal
middle
part
of
the
primitive
gut
while
the
two
detach
themselves
from
it
on
both
sides
the
simple
is
formed
by
the
coalescence
of
the
two
when
the
has
attained
this
stage
of
development
it
begins
to
move
about
in
the
ovolemma
this
causes
the
membrane
to
burst
the
larva
emerges
from
it
and
swims
about
in
the
sea
by
means
of
its
tail
these
larvæ
of
the
ascidia
have
been
known
for
a
long
time
they
were
first
observed
by
darwin
during
his
voyage
round
the
world
in
they
resemble
tadpoles
in
outward
appearance
and
use
their
tails
as
oars
as
the
tadpoles
do
however
this
lively
and
condition
does
not
last
long
at
first
there
is
a
progressive
development
the
foremost
part
of
the
medullary
tube
enlarges
into
a
brain
and
inside
this
two
single
are
developed
a
dorsal
auditory
vesicle
and
a
ventral
eye
then
a
heart
is
formed
on
the
ventral
side
of
the
animal
or
the
lower
wall
of
the
gut
in
the
same
simple
form
and
at
the
same
spot
at
which
the
heart
is
developed
in
man
and
all
the
other
vertebrates
in
the
lower
muscular
wall
of
the
gut
we
find
a
thickening
a
solid
string
of
cells
which
becomes
hollow
in
the
centre
it
begins
to
contract
in
different
directions
now
forward
and
now
backward
as
is
the
case
with
the
adult
ascidia
in
this
way
the
sanguineous
fluid
accumulated
in
the
hollow
muscular
tube
is
driven
in
alternate
directions
into
the
which
develop
at
both
ends
of
the
cardiac
tube
one
principal
vessel
runs
along
the
dorsal
side
of
the
gut
another
along
its
ventral
side
the
former
corresponds
to
the
aorta
and
the
dorsal
vessel
in
the
worms
the
other
corresponds
to
the
subintestinal
vein
and
the
ventral
vessel
of
the
worms

this

in

the

is
effected
by
a
number
of

which
can
be
seen
even
in

the

is
lost
as
there
is
no
further
use

it
it

a
fatty
degeneration
and
disappears
with
the

the
tailless

changes
into
an
unshapely

and
by
the
atrophy
of
some
parts
and
the
modification
of
others
gradually
assumes
the
appearance
we
have
already
described
among
the
living
tunicates
there
is
a
very
interesting
group
of
small
animals
that
remain
throughout
life
at
the
stage
of
development
of
the

swim
about

they
are
the
only
living
vertebrates
that
have
throughout
life
a
chorda

and
a
neural
string

the
latter
must
be
regarded
as
the
prolongation
of
the
cerebral
ganglion
and
the
equivalent
of
the
medullary
tube
their
branchial
gut
also
opens
directly
outwards
by
a

branchial
clefts
these
instructive
copelata
comparable

next
to
the
extinct
prochordonia
those
ancient

which
we
must
regard
as
the
common

of

vertebrates
the

the
atrophy
of
one
of
its
chief
organs
the
medullary
tube
in
the
amphioxus
the
spinal
marrow
continues
to
develop
but
in
the
ascidia
the
tube
soon
shrinks
into
a
small
and
insignificant
nervous
ganglion
that
lies
above
the
mouth
and
the
and
is
in
accord
with
the
extremely
slight
mental
power
of
the
animal
this
insignificant
relic
of
the
medullary
tube
seems
to
be
quite
beyond
comparison
with
the
nervous
centre
of
the
vertebrate
yet
it
started
from
the
same
structure
as
the
spinal
cord
of
the
amphioxus
the
that
had
been
developed
in
the
fore
part
of
the
neural
tube
are
also
lost
no
trace
of
which
can
be
found
in
the
adult
ascidia
on
the
other
hand
the
alimentary
canal
becomes
a
most
extensive
organ
it
divides
presently
into
two
wide
fore
or
branchial
gut
that
serves
for
respiration
and
a
narrower

accomplishes

the

a
couple

developed

their

greatly
increases
we
get
a
large

find
the

also
formed
in
the

way
in
the

in

corresponds
to

branchial
pore
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
adult

the

gut
and
the

on
its
ventral
side
are
almost
the
only
organs
that
recall
the
original
affinity
with
the
vertebrates
the
further
development
of
the
ascidia
in
detail
has
no
particular
interest
for
us
and
we
will
not
go
into
it
the
chief
result
that
we
obtain
from
its
embryology
is
the
complete
agreement
with
that
of
the
amphioxus
in
the
earliest
and
most
important
embryonic
stages
they
do
not
begin
to
diverge
until
after
the
medullary
tube
and
alimentary
canal
and
the
axial
rod
with
the
muscles
between
the
two
have
been
formed
the
amphioxus
continues
to
advance
and
resembles
the
embryonic
forms
of
the
higher
vertebrates
the
ascidia
degenerates
more
and
more
and
at
last
in
its
adult
condition
has
the
appearance
of
a
very
imperfect
invertebrate
if
we
now
look
back
on
all
the
remarkable
features
we
have
encountered
in
the
structure
and
the
embryonic
development
of
the
amphioxus
and
the
ascidia
and
compare
them
with
the
features
of
embryonic
development
which
we
have
previously
studied
it
will
be
clear
that
i
have
not
exaggerated
the
importance
of
these
very
interesting
animals
it
is
evident
that
the
amphioxus
from
the
vertebrate
side
and
the
ascidia
from
the
invertebrate
form
the
bridge
by
which
we
can
span
the
deep
gulf
that
separates
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
animal

the
radical
agreement
of
the
lancelet
and

the
first
and
most
important
stages
of

shows
something
more
than
their
close
anatomic
affinity
and
their
proximity
in
classification
it
shows
also
their
real
and
their
common
origin

duration
of
the
history
of
our
stem
our
comparative
investigation
of
the
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
amphioxus
and
ascidia
has
given
us
invaluable
assistance
we
have
in
the
first
place
bridged
the
wide
gulf
that
has
existed
up
to
the
present
between
the
vertebrates
and
invertebrates
and
in
the
second
place
we
have
discovered
in
the
embryology
of
the
amphioxus
a
number
of
ancient
evolutionary
stages
that
have
long
since
disappeared
from
human
embryology
and
have
been
lost
in
virtue
of
the
law
of
curtailed
heredity
the
chief
of
these
stages
are
the
spherical
blastula
in
its
simplest
primary
form
and
the
succeeding
archigastrula
the
pure
original
form
of
the
which
the
amphioxus
has
preserved
to
this
day
and
which
we
find
in
the
same
form
in
a
number
of
invertebrates
of
various
classes
not
less
important
are
the
later
embryonic
forms
of
the
cœlomula
the
chordula
etc
thus
the
embryology
of
the
amphioxus
and
the
ascidia
has
so
much
increased
our
knowledge
of
that
although
our
empirical
information
is
still
very
incomplete
there
is
now
no
defect
of
any
great
consequence
in
it
we
may
now
therefore
approach
our
proper
task
and
reconstruct
the
phylogeny
of
man
in
its
chief
lines
with
the
aid
of
this
evidence
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
in
this
the
reader
will
soon
see
the
immense
importance
of
the
direct
application
of
the
biogenetic
law
but
before
we
enter
upon
the
work
it
will
be
useful
to
make
a
few
general
observations
that
are
necessary
to
understand
the
processes
aright
we
must
say
a
few
words
with
regard
to
the
period
in
which
the
human
race
was
evolved
from
the
animal
kingdom
the
first
thought
that
occurs
to
one
in
this
connection
is
the
vast
difference
between
the
duration
of
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
the
individual
man
needs
only
nine
months
for
his
complete
development
from
the
fecundation
of
the
ovum
to
the
moment
when
he
leaves
the
maternal
womb
the
human
embryo
runs
its
whole
course
in
the
brief
space
of
forty
weeks
as
a
rule
days
in
many
other
mammals
the
time
of
the
embryonic
development
is
much
the
same
as
in
instance
in
the
cow
in
the
horse
and
ass
it
takes
a
little
longer
to
weeks
in
the
camel
thirteen
months
in
the
largest
mammals
the
embryo
needs
a
much
longer
period
for
its
development
in
the
year
and
a
half
in
the
rhinoceros
and
ninety
weeks
in
the
elephant

take
place

we
compare
it
with

enormous
period
that

for

or
the
gradual
development
of
the

this

is
not
measured
by

or
centuries
but
by
thousands
and
millions
of

many
millions
of
years
had
to
pass
before
the
most
advanced
vertebrate
man
was
evolved
step
by
step
from
his
ancient
unicellular

the
opponents
of

who
declare
that
this
gradual
development
of
the
human
form
from
lower
animal
forms
and
ultimately
from
a
unicellular
organism
is
an
incredible
miracle
forget
that
the
same
miracle
takes
place
within
the
space
of
mine
months
in
the
embryonic

of
every
human
being
each
of
us
has
in
the
forty
speaking
in
the
first

his
development
in
the
womb
passed
through
the
same
series
of
transformations
that
our
animal
ancestors
underwent
in
the
course
of
millions
of
years
it
is
impossible
to
determine
even
approximately
in
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
years
the
real
and
absolute
duration
of
the
phylogenetic
period
but
for
some
time
now
we
have
through
the
research
of
geologists
been
in
a
position
to
assign
the
relative
length
of
the
various
sections
of
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
the
immediate
data
for
determining
this
relative
length
of
the
geological
periods
are
found
in
the
thickness
of
the
sedimentary
strata
that
have
been
formed
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
in
fresh
water
from
the
mud
or
slime
deposited
there
these
successive
layers
of
limestone
sandstone
slate
marl
which
make
up
the
greater
part
of
the
rocks
and
are
often
several
thousand
feet
thick
give
us
a
standard
for
computing
the
relative
length
of
the
various
periods
to
make
the
point
quite
clear
i
must
say
a
word
about
the
evolution
of
the
earth
in
general
and
point
out
briefly
the
chief
features
of
the
story
in
the
first
place
we
encounter
the
principle
that
on
our
planet
organic
life
began
to
exist
at
a
definite
period
that
statement
is
no
longer
disputed
by
any
competent
geologist
or
biologist
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
could
not
commence
until
it
was
possible
for
water
to
settle
on
our
planet
in
fluid
condition
every
organism
without
exception
needs
fluid
water
as
a
condition
of
existence
and
contains
a
considerable
quantity
of
it
our
own
body
when
fully
formed
contains
sixty
to
seventy
per
cent
of
water
in
its
tissues
and
only
thirty
to
forty
per
cent
of
solid
matter
there
is
even
more
water
in
the
body
of
the
child
and
still
more
in
the
embryo
in
the
earlier
stages
of
development
the
human
fœtus
contains
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
water
and
not
ten
per
cent
of
solids
in
the
lower
marine
animals
especially
certain
medusæ
the
body
consists
to
the
extent
of
more
than
per
cent
of
and
has
not
one
per
cent
of
solid
matter
no
organism
can
exist
or
discharge
its
functions
without
water
no
water
no
life
but
fluid
water
on
which
the
existence
of
life
primarily
depends
could
not
exist
on
our
planet
until
the
temperature
of
the
surface
of
the
incandescent
sphere
had
sunk
to
a
certain
point
up
to
that
time
it
remained
in
the
form
of
steam
but
as
soon
as
the
first
fluid
water
could
be
condensed
from
the
envelope
of
steam
it
began
its
geological
action
and
has
continued
down
to
the
present
day
to
modify
the
solid
crust
of
the
earth
the
final
outcome
of
this
incessant
action
of
the
down
and
dissolving
the
rocks
in
the
form
of
rain
hail
snow
and
ice
as
running
stream
or
boiling
the
formation
of
mud
as
huxley
says
in
his
admirable
on
the
causes
of
phenomena
in
organic
nature
the
chief
document
as
to
the
past
history
of
our
earth
is
mud
the
question
of
the
history
of
past
ages
resolves
itself
into
a
question
about
the
formation
of
mud
as
i
have
said
it
is
possible
to
form
an
approximate
idea
of
the
relative
age
of
the
various
strata
by
comparing
them
at
different
parts
of
the
surface
geologists
have
long
been
agreed
that
there
is
a
definite
historical
succession
of
the
different
strata
the
various
superimposed
layers
correspond
to
successive
periods
in
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
in
which
they
were
deposited
in
the
form
of
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
mud
was
gradually
converted
into
stone
this
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
owing
to
variations
in
the
surface
and
formed
the
mountains
as
a
rule
four
or
five
great
divisions
are
distinguished
in
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
corresponding
to
the
larger
and
smaller
groups
of
the
sedimentary
strata
the
larger
periods
are
then
into
a
series
of
smaller
ones
which
usually
number
from
twelve
to
fifteen
the
comparative
thickness
of
the
groups
of
strata
enables
us
to
make
an
approximate
calculation
of
the
relative
length
of
these
various
periods
of
time
we
can
not
say
it
is
true
a
century
a
stratum
of
a
certain
thickness
about
two
feet
is
formed
on
the
average
therefore
a
layer
feet
thick
must
be
years
different
strata
of
the
same
thickness
may
need
very
different
periods
for
their
formation
but
from
the
thickness
or
size
of
the
stratum
we
can
draw
some
conclusion
as
to
the
length
of
the
period
the
first
and
oldest
of
the
four
or
five
chief
divisions
of
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
is
called
the
primordial
archaic
or
archeozoic
period
if
we
compute
the
total
average
thickness
of
the
sedimentary
strata
at
about
feet
this
first
period
comprises
feet
or
the
greater
part
of
the
whole
for
this
and
other
reasons
we
may
at
once
conclude
that
the
corresponding
primordial
or
archeolithic
period
must
have
been
in
itself
much
longer
than
the
whole
of
the
remaining
periods
together
from
its
close
to
the
present
day
it
was
probably
much
longer
than
the
figures

the

into

subordinate
laurentian
huronian
and
cambrian
corresponding
to
the
three
chief
groups
of
rocks
that
comprise
the
archaic
formation
the
immense
period
during
which
these
rocks
were
forming
in
the
primitive
ocean
probably
comprises
more
than
years
at
the
commencement
of
it
the
oldest
and
simplest
organisms
were
formed
by
spontaneous
monera
with
which
the
history
of
life
on
our
planet
opened
from
these
were
first
developed
unicellular
organisms
of
the
simplest
character
the
protophyta
and
protozoa
paulotomea
amœbæ
rhizopods
infusoria
and
other
protists
during
this
period
the
whole
of
the
invertebrate
ancestors
of
the
human
race
were
evolved
from
the
unicellular
organisms
we
can
deduce
this
from
the
fact
that
we
already
find
remains
of
fossilised
fishes
selachii
and
ganoids
towards
the
close
of
the
following
silurian
period
these
are
much
more
advanced
and
much
younger
than
the
lowest
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
and
the
numerous
vertebrates
related
to
the
amphioxus
that
must
have
lived
at
that
time
the
whole
of
the
invertebrate
ancestors
of
the
human
race
must
have
preceded
these
the
primordial
age
is
followed
by
a
much
shorter
division
the
or
primary
age
it
is
divided
into
four
long
periods
the
silurian
devonian
carboniferous
and
permian
the
silurian
strata
are
particularly
interesting
because
they
contain
the
first
fossil
traces
of
and
scales
of
selachii
in
the
lower
and
ganoids
in
the
upper
silurian
during
the
devonian
period
the
red
was
formed
during
the
carboniferous
period
were
deposited
the
vast
that
yield
us
our
chief
combustive
material
in
the
permian
or
the
dyas
in
fine
the
new
red
sandstone
the
zechstein
magnesian
limestone
and
the
kupferschiefer
were
formed
the
collective
depth
of
these
strata
is
put
at
to
feet
in
any
case
the
paleozoic
age
taken
as
a
whole
was
much
shorter
than
the
preceding
and
much
longer
than
the
subsequent
periods
the
strata
that
were
deposited
during
this
primary
epoch
contain
a
large
number
of
fossils
besides
the
invertebrate
species
there
are
a
good
many
vertebrates
and
the
fishes
preponderate
there
were
so
many
fishes
especially
primitive
fishes
of
the
shark
type
and
plated
fishes
during
the
devonian
and
also
during
the
carboniferous
and
permian
periods
that
we
may
describe
the
whole
paleozoic
period
as
age
of
among
the
paleozoic
plated
fishes
or
ganoids
the
crossopterygii
and
the
ctenodipterina
dipneusts
are
of
great
importance
during
this
period
some
of
the
fishes
began
to
adapt
themselves
to
living
on
land
and
so
gave
rise
to
the
class
of
the
amphibia
we
find
in
the
carboniferous
period
fossilised
remains
of
amphibia
the
oldest
terrestrial
vertebrates
these
amphibia
increase
in
variety
in
the
permian
epoch
towards
the
close
of
it
we
find
the
first
amniotes
the
ancestors
of
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
these
are
animals
the
first
to
be
discovered
was
the
from
the
marl
at
eisenach
the
rise
of
the
earliest
amniotes
among
which
must
have
been
the
common
ancestor
of
the
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
is
put
back
towards
the
close
of
the
paleozoic
age
by
the
discovery
of
these
reptile
remains
the
ancestors
of
our
race
during
this
period
were
at
first
represented
by
true
fishes
then
by
dipneusts
and
amphibia
and
finally
by
the
earliest
amniotes
or
the
protamniotes
the
third
chief
section
of
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
is
the
or
secondary
period
this
again
is
subdivided
into
three
divisions
triassic
jurassic
and
cretaceous
the
thickness
of
the
strata
that
were
deposited
in
this
period
from
the
beginning
of
the
triassic
to
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
period
is
altogether
about
feet
or
not
half
as
much
as
the
paleozoic
deposits
during
this
period
there
was
a
very
brisk
and
manifold
development
in
all
branches
of
the
animal
kingdom
there
were
especially
a
number
of
new
and
interesting
forms
evolved
in
the
vertebrate
stem
bony
fishes
make
their
first
appearance
reptiles
are
found
in
extraordinary
variety
and
number
the
extinct
dinosauria
the
halisauria
and
the
flying
lizards
pterosauria
are
the
most
remarkable
and
best
known
of
these
on
account
of
this
predominance
of
the
the
period
is
called
age
of
but
the
was
also
evolved
during
this
period
they
certainly
originated
from
some
division
of
the
reptiles
this
is
proved
by
the
embryological
identity
of
the
birds
and
reptiles
and
their
comparative
anatomy
and
among
other
features
from
the
circumstance
that
in
this
period
there
were
birds
with
teeth
in
their
jaws
and
with
tails
like
lizards
archeopteryx
odontornis
finally
the
most
advanced
and
for
us
the
most
important
class
of
the
vertebrates
the
mammals
made
their
appearance
during
the
mesozoic
period
the
earliest
fossil
remains
of
them
were
found
in
the
latest
triassic
jaws
of
small
ungulates
and
marsupials
more
numerous
remains
are
found
a
little
later
in
the
jurassic
and
some
in
the
cretaceous
all
the
mammal
remains
that
we
have
from
this
section
belong
to
the
lower
promammals
and
marsupials
among
these
were
most
certainly
the
ancestors
of
the
human
race
on
the
other
hand
we
have
not
found
a
single
indisputable
fossil
of
any
higher
mammal
a
placental
in
the
whole
of
this
period
this
division
of
the
mammals
which
includes
man
was
not
developed
until
later
towards
the
close
of
this
or
in
the
following
period
the
fourth
section
of
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
the
tertiary
or
age
was
much
shorter
than
the
preceding
the
strata
that
were
deposited
during
this
period
have
a
collective
thickness
of
only
about
feet
it
is
subdivided
into
four
eocene
oligocene
miocene
and
pliocene
during
these
periods
there
was
a
very
varied
development
of
higher
plant
and
animal
forms
the
fauna
and
flora
of
our
planet
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
character
that
they
bear
in
particular
the
most
advanced
class
the
mammals
began
to
preponderate
hence
the
tertiary
period
may
be
called
age
of
the
highest
section
of
this
class
the
placentals
now
made
their
appearance
to
this
group
the
human
race
belongs
the
first
appearance
of
man
or
to
be
more
precise
the
development
of
man
from
some
group
of
apes
probably
falls
in
either
the
miocene
or
the
pliocene
period
the
middle
or
the
last
section
of
the
tertiary
period
others
believe
that
man
properly
endowed
with
not
evolved
from
the
until
the
following
the
anthropozoic
age
in
this
fifth
and
last
section
of
the
organic
history
of
the
earth
we
have
the
full
development
and
dispersion
of
the
various
races
of
men
and
so
it
is
called
the
as
well
as
the
period
in
the
imperfect
condition
of
paleontological
and
ethnographical
science
we
can
not
as
yet
give
a
confident
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
from
some
extinct
ape
or
lemur
took
place
at
the
beginning
of
this
or
towards
the
middle
or
the
end
of
the
tertiary
period
however
this
much
is
certain
the
development
of
civilisation
falls
in
the
anthropozoic
age
and
this
is
merely
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
vast
period
of
the
whole
history
of
life
when
we
remember
this
it
seems
ridiculous
to
restrict
the
word
to
the
civilised
period
if
we
divide
into
a
hundred
equal
parts
the
whole
period
of
the
history
of
life
from
the
spontaneous
generation
of
the
first
monera
to
the
present
day
and
if
we
then
represent
the
relative
duration
of
the
five
chief
sections
or
ages
as
calculated
from
the
average
thickness
of
the
strata
they
contain
as
percentages
of
this
we
get
something
like
the
following
relation
ii
iii
iv
archeolithic
or
archeozoic
primordial
age
paleolithic
or
paleozoic
primary
age
mesolithic
or
mesozoic
secondary
age
cenolithic
or
cenozoic
tertiary
age
anthropolithic
or
anthropozoic
quaternary
age
in
any
case
the
is
an
insignificant
quantity
compared
with
the
vast
length
of
the
preceding
ages
in
which
there
was
no
question
of
human
existence
on
our
planet
even
the
important
cenozoic
or
tertiary
period
in
which
the
first
placentals
or
higher
mammals
appear
probably
amounts
to
little
over
two
per
cent
of
the
whole
organic
age
before
we
approach
our
proper
task
and
with
the
aid
of
our
ontogenetic
acquirements
and
the
biogenetic
law
follow
step
by
step
the
paleontological
development
of
our
animal
ancestors
let
us
glance
for
a
moment
at
another
and
apparently
quite
remote
branch
of
science
a
general
consideration
of
which
will
help
us
in
the
solving
of
a
difficult
problem
i
mean
the
science
of
comparative
philology
since
darwin
gave
new
life
to
biology
by
his
theory
of
selection
and
raised
the
question
of
evolution
on
all
sides
it
has
often
been
pointed
out
that
there
is
a
remarkable
analogy
between
the
development
of
languages
and
the
evolution
of
species
the
comparison
is
perfectly
just
and
very
instructive
we
could
hardly
find
a
better
analogy
when
we
are
dealing
with
some
of
the
difficult
and
obscure
features
of
the
evolution
of
species
in
both
cases
we
find
the
action
of
the
same
natural
laws
all
philologists
of
any
competence
in
their
science
now
agree
that
all
human
languages
have
been
gradually
evolved
from
very
rudimentary
beginnings
the
idea
that
speech
is
a
gift
of
the
idea
held
by
distinguished
authorities
only
fifty
years
now
generally
abandoned
and
only
supported
by
theologians
and
others
who
admit
no
natural
development
whatever
speech
has
been
developed
simultaneously
with
its
organs
the
larynx
and
tongue
and
with
the
functions
of
the
brain
hence
it
will
be
quite
natural
to
find
in
the
evolution
and
classification
of
languages
the
same
features
as
in
the
evolution
and
classification
of
organic
species
the
various
groups
of
languages
that
are
distinguished
in
philology
as
primitive
fundamental
parent
and
daughter
languages
dialects
correspond
entirely
in
their
development
to
the
different
categories
which
we
classify
in
zoology
and
botany
as
stems
classes
orders
families
genera
species
and
varieties
the
relation
of
these
groups
partly
and
partly
subordinate
in
the
general
scheme
is
just
the
same
in
both
cases
and
the
evolution
follows
the
same
lines
in
both
when
with
the
assistance
of
this
tree
we
follow
the
formation
of
the
various
languages
that
have
been
developed
from
the
common
root
of
the
ancient
tongue
we
get
a
very
clear
idea
of
their
phylogeny
we
shall
see
at
the
same
time
how
analogous
this
is
to
the
development
of
the
various
groups
of
vertebrates
that
have
arisen
from
the
common
of
the
primitive
vertebrate
the
ancient
divided
first
into
two
principal
and
the
the
stem
then
branches
into
the
ancient
germanic
and
the
ancient
tongues
the
into
the
ancient
aryan
and
the
ancient
if
we
still
follow
the
genealogical
tree
of
these
four
tongues
we
find
that
the
ancient
germanic
divides
into
three
scandinavian
the
gothic
and
the
german
from
the
ancient
german
came
the
high
german
and
low
german
to
the
latter
belong
the
frisian
saxon
and
modern
dialects
the
ancient
divided
first
into
a
baltic
and
a
slav
language
the
baltic
gave
rise
to
the
lett
lithuanian
and
varieties
the
slav
to
the
russian
and
in
the
and
to
the
polish
and
czech
in
the
west
we
find
an
equally
prolific
branching
of
its
two
chief
stems
when
we
turn
to
the
other
division
of
the
languages
the
divided
into
the
thracian
and
the
from
the
latter
came
the
divergent
branches
of
the
italic
roman
and
latin
in
the
south
and
the
celtic
in
the
north
from
the
latter
have
been
developed
all
the
british
ancient
british
ancient
scotch
and
irish
and
gallic
varieties
the
ancient
aryan
gave
rise
to
the
numerous
iranian
and
indian
languages
this
and
evolution
of
languages
admirably
illustrates
the
phylogeny
of
species
it
is
clear
that
in
structure
and
development
the
primitive
languages
mother
and
daughter
languages
and
varieties
correspond
exactly
to
the
classes
orders
genera
and
species
of
the
animal
world
in
both
cases
the
system
is
phylogenetic
as
we
have
been
convinced
from
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
and
from
paleontology
that
all
past
and
living
vertebrates
descend
from
a
common
ancestor
so
the
comparative
study
of
dead
and
living
tongues
proves
beyond
question
that
they
are
all
modifications
of
one
primitive
language
this
view
of
their
origin
is
now
accepted
by
all
the
chief
philologists
who
have
worked
in
this
branch
and
are
unprejudiced
but
the
point
to
which
i
desire
particularly
to
draw
the
attention
in
this
comparison
of
the
languages
with
the
branches
of
the
vertebrate
stem
is
that
one
must
never
confuse
direct
descendants
with
collateral
branches
nor
extinct
forms
with
living
this
confusion
is
very
common
and
our
opponents
often
make
use
of
the
erroneous
ideas
it
gives
rise
to
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
evolution
generally
when
for
instance
we
say
that
man
descends
from
the
ape
this
from
the
lemur
and
the
lemur
from
the
marsupial
many
people
imagine
that
we
are
speaking
of
the
living
species
of
these
orders
of
mammals
that
they
find
stuffed
in
our
museums
our
opponents
then
foist
this
idea
on
us
and
say
with
more
astuteness
than
intelligence
that
it
is
quite
impossible
or
they
ask
us
by
way
of
physiological
experiment
to
turn
a
kangaroo
into
a
lemur
a
lemur
into
a
gorilla
and
a
gorilla
into
a
man
the
demand
is
childish
and
the
idea
it
rests
on
erroneous
all
these
living
forms
have
diverged
more
or
less
from
the
ancestral
form
none
of
them
could
engender
the
same
posterity
that
the
really
produced
thousands
of
years
ago
it
is
certain
that
man
has
descended
from
some
extinct
mammal
and
we
should
just
as
certainly
class
this
in
the
order
of
apes
if
we
had
it
before
us
it
is
equally
certain
that
this
primitive
ape
descended
in
turn
from
an
unknown
lemur
and
this
from
an
extinct
marsupial
but
it
is
just
as
clear
that
all
these
extinct
ancestral
forms
can
only
be
claimed
as
belonging
to
the
living
order
of
mammals
in
virtue
of
their
essential
internal
structure
and
their
resemblance
in
the
decisive
anatomic
characteristics
of
each
in
external
appearance
in
the
characteristics
of
the
or
they
would
differ
more
or
less
perhaps
very
considerably
from
all
living
representatives
of
those
orders
it
is
a
universal
and
natural
procedure
in
phylogenetic
development
that
the
themselves
with
their
specific
peculiarities
have
been
extinct
for
some
time
the
forms
that
approach
nearest
to
them
among
the
living
species
are
more
or
very
from
them
hence
in
our
phylogenetic
inquiry
and
in
the
comparative
study
of
the
living
divergent
descendants
there
can
only
be
a
question
of
determining
the
greater
or
less
remoteness
of
the
latter
from
the
ancestral
form
not
a
single
one
of
the
older
has
continued
unchanged
down
to
our
time
we
find
just
the
same
thing
in
comparing
the
various
dead
and
living
languages
that
have
developed
from
a
common
primitive
tongue
if
we
examine
our
genealogical
tree
of
the
languages
in
this
light
we
see
at
once
that
all
the
older
or
parent
tongues
of
which
we
regard
the
living
varieties
of
the
stem
as
divergent
daughter
or
languages
have
been
extinct
for
some
time
the
and
the
tongues
have
completely
disappeared
so
also
the
aryan
the
the
and
the
ancient
germanic
even
their
daughters
and
have
been
lost
all
the
living
languages
are
only
related
in
the
sense
that
they
are
divergent
descendants
of
common
some
forms
have
diverged
more
and
some
less
from
the
original
this
easily
demonstrable
fact
illustrates
very
well
the
analogous
case
of
the
origin
of
the
vertebrate
species
phylogenetic
comparative
philology
here
yields
a
strong
support
to
phylogenetic
comparative
zoology
but
the
one
can
adduce
more
direct
evidence
than
the
other
as
the
paleontological
material
of
old
monuments
of
the
extinct
been
preserved
much
better
than
the
paleontological
material
of
zoology
the
fossilised
bones
and
imprints
of
vertebrates
we
may
however
trace
genealogical
tree
not
only
as
far
as
the
lower
mammals
but
much
the
amphibia
to
the
primitive
fishes
and
in
fine
to
the
vertebrates
that
closely
resembled
the
amphioxus
but
this
must
not
be
understood
in
the
sense
that
the
existing
amphioxus
or
the
sharks
or
amphibia
of
can
give
us
any
idea
of
the
external
appearance
of
these
remote
still
less
must
it
be
thought
that
the
amphioxus
or
any
actual
shark
or
any
living
species
of
amphibia
is
a
real
ancestral
form
of
the
higher
vertebrates
and
man
the
statement
can
only
rationally
mean
that
the
living
forms
i
have
referred
to
are
that
are
much
more
closely
related
to
the
extinct
and
have
retained
the
resemblance
much
better
than
any
other
animals
we
know
they
are
still
so
like
them
in
regard
to
their
distinctive
internal
structure
that
we
should
put
them
in
the
same
class
with
the
extinct
forms
if
we
had
these
before
us
but
no
direct
descendants
of
these
earlier
forms
have
remained
unchanged
hence
we
must
entirely
abandon
the
idea
of
finding
direct
ancestors
of
the
human
race
in
their
characteristic
among
the
living
species
of
animals
the
essential
and
distinctive
features
that
still
connect
living
forms
more
or
less
closely
with
the
extinct
common
lie
in
the
internal
structure
not
the
external
appearance
the
latter
has
been
much
modified
by
adaptation
the
former
has
been
more
or
less
preserved
by
heredity
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
prove
beyond
question
that
man
is
a
true
vertebrate
and
therefore
special
genealogical
tree
must
be
connected
with
that
of
the
other
vertebrates
which
spring
from
a
common
root
with
him
but
we
have
also
many
important
grounds
in
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
for
assuming
a
common
origin
for
all
the
vertebrates
if
the
general
theory
of
evolution
is
correct
all
the
vertebrates
including
man
come
from
a
single
common
ancestor
a
hence
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
vertebrates
is
at
the
same
time
that
of
the
human
race
our
task
therefore
of
constructing
genealogy
becomes
the
larger
aim
of
discovering
the
genealogy
of
the
entire
vertebrate
stem
as
we
now
know
from
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
amphioxus
and
the
ascidia
this
is
in
turn
connected
with
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
invertebrates
directly
with
that
of
the
vermalia
but
has
no
direct
connection
with
the
independent
stems
of
the
articulates
molluscs
and
echinoderms
if
we
do
thus
follow
our
ancestral
tree
through
various
stages
down
to
the
lowest
worms
we
come
inevitably
to
the
that
most
instructive
form
that
gives
the
clearest
possible
picture
of
an
animal
with
two
germinal
layers
the
gastræa
itself
has
originated
from
the
simple
multicellular
vesicle
the
and
this
in
turn
must
have
been
evolved
from
the
lowest
circle
of
unicellular
animals
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
protozoa
we
have
already
considered
the
most
important
primitive
type
of
these
the
unicellular
which
is
extremely
instructive
when
compared
with
the
human
ovum
with
this
we
reach
the
lowest
of
the
solid
data
to
which
we
are
to
apply
our
biogenetic
law
and
by
which
we
may
deduce
the
extinct
ancestor
from
the
embryonic
form
the
amœboid
nature
of
the
young
ovum
and
the
unicellular
condition
in
which
as
or
cytula
every
human
being
begins
its
existence
justify
us
in
affirming
that
the
earliest
ancestors
of
the
human
race
were
simple
amœboid
coils
but
the
further
question
now
arises
came
these
first
amœbæ
with
which
the
history
of
life
began
at
the
commencement
of
the
laurentian
epoch
there
is
only
one
answer
to
this
the
earliest
unicellular
organisms
can
only
have
been
evolved
from
the
simplest
organisms
we
know
the
these
are
the
simplest
living
things
that
we
can
conceive
their
whole
body
is
nothing
but
a
particle
of
plasm
a
granule
of
living
albuminous
matter
discharging
of
itself
all
the
essential
vital
functions
that
form
the
material
basis
of
life
thus
we
come
to
the
last
or
if
you
prefer
the
first
question
in
connection
with
question
of
the
origin
of
the
monera
this
is
the
real
question
of
the
origin
of
life
or
of
spontaneous
generation
we
have
neither
space
nor
occasion
to
go
further
in
this
chapter
into
the
question
of
spontaneous
generation
for
this
i
must
refer
the
reader
to
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
the
of
creation
and
especially
to
the
second
book
of
the
morphology
or
to
the
essay
on
monera
and
spontaneous
in
my
of
the
monera
and
other
i
have
given
there
fully
my
own
view
of
this
important
question
the
famous
botanist
nägeli
afterwards
developed
the
same
ideas
i
will
only
say
a
few
words
here
about
this
obscure
question
of
the
origin
of
life
in
so
far
as
our
main
subject
organic
evolution
in
general
is
affected
by
it
spontaneous
generation
in
the
definite
and
restricted
sense
in
which
i
maintain
it
and
claim
that
it
is
a
necessary
hypothesis
in
explaining
the
origin
of
life
refers
solely
to
the
evolution
of
the
monera
from
inorganic
when
living
things
made
their
first
appearance
on
our
planet
the
very
complex
nitrogenous
compound
of
carbon
that
we
call
which
is
the
earliest
material
embodiment
of
vital
action
must
have
been
formed
in
a
purely
chemical
way
from
inorganic
the
first
monera
were
formed
in
the
sea
by
spontaneous
generation
as
crystals
are
formed
in
the
our
demand
for
a
knowledge
of
causes
compels
us
to
assume
this
if
we
believe
that
the
whole
inorganic
history
of
the
earth
has
proceeded
on
mechanical
principles
without
any
intervention
of
a
creator
and
that
the
history
of
life
also
has
been
determined
by
the
same
mechanical
laws
if
we
see
that
there
is
no
need
to
admit
creative
action
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
various
groups
of
organisms
it
is
utterly
irrational
to
assume
such
creative
action
in
dealing
with
the
first
appearance
of
organic
life
on
the
earth
the
english
reader
will
find
a
luminous
and
chapter
on
the
subject
in
recently
written
and
translated
of
this
question
of
seems
so
obscure
because
people
have
associated
with
the
term
a
mass
of
very
different
and
often
very
absurd
ideas
and
have
attempted
to
solve
the
difficulty
by
the
crudest
experiments
the
real
doctrine
of
the
spontaneous
generation
of
life
can
not
possibly
be
refuted
by
experiments
every
experiment
that
has
a
negative
result
only
proves
that
no
organism
has
been
formed
out
of
inorganic
matter
in
the
artificial
have
established
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
prove
the
theory
by
way
of
experiment
and
even
if
monera
were
still
formed
daily
by
spontaneous
generation
which
is
quite
possible
it
would
be
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
find
a
solid
proof
of
it
those
who
will
not
admit
the
spontaneous
generation
of
the
first
living
things
in
our
sense
must
have
recourse
to
a
supernatural
miracle
and
this
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
desperate
resource
to
which
our
scientists
are
driven
to
the
complete
abdication
of
reason
a
famous
english
physicist
lord
kelvin
then
sir
thomson
attempted
to
dispense
with
the
hypothesis
of
spontaneous
generation
by
assuming
that
the
organic
inhabitants
of
the
earth
were
developed
from
germs
that
came
from
the
inhabitants
of
other
planets
and
that
chanced
to
fall
on
our
planet
on
fragments
of
their
original
home
or
meteorites
this
hypothesis
found
many
supporters
among
others
the
distinguished
german
physicist
helmholtz
however
it
was
refuted
in
by
the
able
physicist
friedrich
zöllner
of
leipzig
in
his
work
the
nature
of
he
showed
clearly
how
unscientific
this
hypothesis
is
firstly
in
point

our
protist
ancestors
under
the
guidance
of
the
biogenetic
law
and
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
we
have
obtained
we
now
turn
to
the
interesting
task
of
determining
the
series
of
animal
ancestors
phylogeny
us
a
whole
is
an
inductive
science
from
the
totality
of
the
biological
processes
in
the
life
of
plants
animals
and
man
we
have
gathered
a
confident
inductive
idea
that
the
whole
organic
population
of
our
planet
has
been
moulded
on
a
harmonious
law
of
evolution
all
the
interesting
phenomena
that
we
meet
in
ontogeny
and
paleontology
comparative
anatomy
and
dysteleology
the
distribution
and
habits
of
the
important
general
laws
that
we
abstract
from
the
phenomena
of
these
sciences
and
combine
in
harmonious
the
broad
bases
of
our
great
biological
induction
but
when
we
come
to
the
application
of
this
law
and
seek
to
determine
with
its
aid
the
origin
of
the
various
species
of
organisms
we
are
compelled
to
frame
hypotheses
that
have
essentially
a
character
and
are
inferences
from
the
general
law
to
particular
cases
but
these
special
deductions
are
just
as
much
justified
and
necessitated
by
the
rigorous
laws
of
logic
as
the
inductive
conclusions
on
which
the
whole
theory
of
evolution
is
built
the
doctrine
of
the
animal
ancestry
of
the
human
race
is
a
special
deduction
of
this
kind
and
follows
with
logical
necessity
from
the
general
inductive
law
of
evolution
i
must
point
out
at
once
however
that
the
certainty
of
these
evolutionary
hypotheses
which
rest
on
clear
special
deductions
is
not
always
equally
strong
some
of
these
inferences
are
now
beyond
question
in
the
case
of
others
it
depends
on
the
knowledge
and
the
competence
of
the
inquirer
what
degree
of
certainty
he
attributes
to
them
in
any
case
we
must
distinguish
between
the
certainty
of
the
general
inductive
theory
of
descent
and
the
certainty
of
special
deductive
evolutionary
hypotheses
we
can
never
determine
the
whole
ancestral
series
of
an
organism
with
the
same
confidence
with
which
we
hold
the
general
theory
of
evolution
as
the
sole
scientific
explanation
of
organic
modifications
the
special
indication
of
in
detail
will
always
be
more
or
less
incomplete
and
hypothetical
this
is
quite
natural
the
evidence
on
which
we
build
is
imperfect
and
always
will
be
imperfect
just
as
in
comparative
philology
the
first
of
our
documents
paleontology
is
exceedingly
incomplete
we
know
that
all
the
fossils
yet
discovered
are
only
an
insignificant
fraction
of
the
plants
and
animals
that
have
lived
on
our
planet
for
every
single
species
that
has
been
preserved
for
us
in
the
rocks
there
are
probably
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
extinct
species
that
have
left
no
trace
behind
them
this
extreme
and
very
unfortunate
incompleteness
of
the
paleontological
evidence
which
can
not
be
pointed
out
too
often
is
easily
explained
it
is
absolutely
inevitable
in
the
circumstances
of
the
fossilisation
of
organisms
it
is
also
due
in
part
to
the
incompleteness
of
our
knowledge
in
this
branch
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
great
majority
of
the
stratified
rocks
that
compose
the
crust
of
the
earth
have
not
yet
been
opened
we
have
only
a
few
specimens
of
the
innumerable
fossils
that
are
buried
in
the
vast
mountain
ranges
of
asia
and
africa
only
a
part
of
europe
and
north
america
has
been
investigated
carefully
the
whole
of
the
fossils
known
to
us
certainly
do
not
amount
to
a
hundredth
part
of
the
remains
that
are
really
buried
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
we
may
therefore
look
forward
to
a
rich
harvest
in
the
future
as
regards
this
science
however
our
paleontological
evidence
will
for
reasons
that
i
have
fully
explained
in
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
the
of
always
be
defective
the
second
chief
source
of
evidence
ontogeny
is
not
less
incomplete
it
is
the
most
important
source
of
all
for
special
phylogeny
but
it
has
great
defects
and
often
fails
us
we
must
above
all
clearly
distinguish
between
palingenetic
and
cenogenetic
phenomena
we
must
never
forget
that
the
laws
of
curtailed
and
disturbed
heredity
often
make
the
original
course
of
development
almost
unrecognisable
the
recapitulation
of
phylogeny
by
ontogeny
is
only
fairly
complete
in
a
few
cases
and
is
never
wholly
complete
as
a
rule
it
is
precisely
the
earliest
and
most
important
embryonic
stages
that
suffer
most
from
alteration
and
condensation
the
earlier
embryonic
forms
have
had
to
adapt
themselves
to
new
circumstances
and
so
have
been
modified
the
struggle
for
existence
has
had
just
as
profound
an
influence
on
the
freely
moving
and
still
immature
young
forms
as
on
the
adult
forms
hence
in
the
embryology
of
the
higher
animals
especially
palingenesis
is
much
restricted
by
cenogenesis
it
is
as
a
rule
only
a
faded
and
much
altered
picture
of
the
original
evolution
of
the
ancestors
we
can
only
draw
conclusions
from
the
embryonic
forms
to
the
with
the
greatest
caution
and
discrimination
moreover
the
embryonic
development
itself
has
only
been
fully
studied
in
a
few
species
finally
the
third
and
most
valuable
source
of
evidence
comparative
anatomy
is
also
unfortunately
very
imperfect
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
whole
of
the
living
species
of
animals
are
a
mere
fraction
of
the
vast
population
that
has
dwelt
on
our
planet
since
the
beginning
of
life
we
may
confidently
put
the
total
number
of
these
at
more
than
a
million
species
the
number
of
animals
whose
organisation
has
been
studied
up
to
the
present
in
comparative
anatomy
is
proportionately
very
small
here
again
future
research
will
yield
incalculable
treasures
but
for
the
present
in
view
of
this
patent
incompleteness
of
our
chief
sources
of
evidence
we
must
naturally
be
careful
not
to
lay
too
much
stress
in
human
phylogeny
on
the
particular
animals
we
have
studied
or
regard
all
the
various
stages
of
development
with
equal
confidence
as
in
my
first
efforts
to
construct
the
series
of
ancestors
i
drew
up
a
list
of
at
first
ten
afterwards
twenty
to
thirty
forms
that
may
be
regarded
more
or
less
certainly
as
animal
ancestors
of
the
human
race
or
as
stages
that
in
a
sense
mark
off
the
chief
sections
in
the
long
story
of
evolution
from
the
unicellular
organism
to
man
of
these
twenty
to
thirty
stages
ten
to
twelve
belong
to
the
older
group
of
the
invertebrates
and
eighteen
to
twenty
to
the
younger
division
of
the
vertebrates
in
approaching
now
the
difficult
task
of
establishing
the
evolutionary
succession
of
these
thirty
ancestors
of
humanity
since
the
beginning
of
life
and
in
venturing
to
lift
the
veil
that
covers
the
earliest
secrets
of
the
history
we
must
undoubtedly
look
for
the
first
living
things
among
the
wonderful
organisms
that
we
call
the
monera
they
are
the
simplest
organisms
known
to
fact
the
simplest
we
can
conceive
their
whole
body
consists
merely
of
a
simple
particle
or
globule
of
structureless
plasm
or
plasson
the
discoveries
of
the
last
four
decades
have
led
us
to
believe
with
increasing
certainty
that
wherever
a
natural
body
exhibits
the
vital
processes
of
nutrition
reproduction
voluntary
movement
and
sensation
we
have
the
action
of
a
nitrogenous
of
the
chemical
group
of
the
albuminoids
this
plasm
or
protoplasm
is
the
material
basis
of
all
vital
functions
whether
we
regarded
the
function
in
the
monistic
sense
as
the
direct
action
of
the
material
substratum
or
whether
we
take
matter
and
force
to
be
distinct
things
in
the
dualistic
sense
it
is
certain
that
we
have
not
as
yet
found
any
living
organism
in
which
the
exercise
of
the
vital
functions
is
not
inseparably
bound
up
with
plasm
the
soft
slimy
plasson
of
the
body
of
the
moneron
is
generally
called
and
identified
with
the
cellular
matter
of
the
ordinary
plant
and
animal
cells
but
we
must
to
be
accurate
distinguish
between
the
plasson
of
the
cytodes
and
the
protoplasm
of
the
cells
this
distinction
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
purposes
of
evolution
as
i
have
often
said
we
must
recognise
two
different
stages
of
development
in
these
organisms
or
plastids
that
represent
the
ultimate
units
of
organic
individuality
the
earlier
and
lower
stage
are
the
unnucleated
cytodes
the
body
of
which
consists
of
only
one
kind
of
albuminous
homogeneous
plasson
or
the
later
and
higher
stage
are
the
nucleated
cells
in
which
we
find
a
differentiation
of
the
original
plasson
into
two
different
formative
caryoplasm
of
the
nucleus
and
the
cytoplasm
of
the
body
of
the
cell

their
whole
body
consists
of
soft
structureless
plasson
however
carefully
we
examine
it
with
our
finest
chemical
reagents
and
most
powerful
microscopes
we
can
find
no
definite
parts
or
no
anatomic
structure
in
it
hence
the
monera
are
literally
organisms
without
organs
in
fact
from
the
philosophic
point
of
view
they
are
not
organisms
at
all
since
they
have
no
organs
they
can
only
be
called
organisms
in
the
sense
that
they
are
capable
of
the
vital
functions
of
nutrition
reproduction
sensation
and
movement
if
we
were
to
try
to
imagine
the
simplest
possible
organism
we
should
frame
something
like
the
moneron

monera

we
find
in
various
forms

into
two
groups

to
the
nature
of

and

physiological
point

remarkable
change
in

gives
us
the
simple
explanation
of
the

the

up

hence
if
we
logically
divide
the
protist

into
protophyta
and
protozoa
we
must
class
the
bacteria
with
the
latter
it
is
quite
illogical
to
describe
is
still
often
and
class
them
with
the
true
fungi
the
bacteria
like
the
chromacea
have
no
nucleus

is

play
an
important
part

the
causes

infectious
diseases

we
can
not
linger
now
to
deal
with
these
very
interesting
features
the
bacteria
have
no
relation

may
now
turn
to
consider
the
remarkable
protamœba

amœba

have
in
the
first
volume
pointed
out
the
great
importance
of
the
ordinary
amœba
in
connection
with
several
weighty
questions
of
general
biology
the
tiny
protamœbæ
which
are
found
both
in
fresh
and
salt
water
have
the
same
unshapely
form
and
irregular
movements
of
their
simple
naked
body
as
the
real
amœbæ
but
they
differ
from
them
very
materially
in
having
no
nucleus
in
their
the
short
blunt
processes
that
are
thrust
out
at
the
surface
of
the
creeping
protamœba

for
getting
food
as
well
as
for
locomotion

much
like
many
of
the
amœbæ
in
size
shape
the
character
of
their
nucleus
and
movement
of
the
pseudopodia
that
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
them
without
knowing
their
subsequent
development
our
phylogenetic
interpretation
of
the
ovum
and
the
reduction
of
it
to
some
ancient
amœboid
ancestral
form
supply
the
answer
to
the
old
problem
was
first
the
egg
or
the
chick
we
can
now
give
a
very
plain
answer
to
this
riddle
with
which
our
opponents
have
often
tried
to
drive
us
into
a
corner
the
egg
came
a
long
time
before
the
chick
we
do
not
mean
of
course
that
the
egg
existed
from
the
first
as
a
egg
but
as
an
indifferent
amœboid
cell
of
the
simplest
character
the
egg
lived
for
thousands
of
years
as
an
independent
unicellular
organism
the
amœba
the
egg
in
the
modern
physiological
sense
of
the
word
did
not
make
its
appearance
until
the
descendants
of
the
unicellular
protozoon
had
developed
into
multicellular
animals
and
these
had
undergone
sexual
differentiation
even
then
the
egg
was
first
a
then
a
then
a
and
later
still
then
and
finally
egg
the
egg
we
have
experience
of
daily
is
a
highly
complicated
historical
product
the
result
of
countless
hereditary
processes
that
have
taken
place
in
the
course
of
millions
of
years
the
earliest
ancestors
of
our
race
were
simple
protophyta
and
from
these
our
protozoic
ancestors
were
developed
afterwards
from
the
morphological
point
of
view
both
the
vegetal
and
the
animal
protists
were
simple
organisms
individualities
of
the
first
order
or
plastids
all
our
later
ancestors
are
complex
organisms
or
individualities
of
a
higher
aggregations
of
a
plurality
of
cells
the
earliest
of
these
the
moræada
which
represent
the
third
stage
in
our
genealogy
are
very
simple
associations
of
homogeneous
indifferent
colonies
of
social
amœbæ
or
infusoria
to
understand
the
nature
and
origin
of
these
we
need
only
follow
step
by
step
the
first
embryonic
products
of
the
in
all
the
metazoa
the
first
embryonic
process
is
the
repeated
cleavage
of
the
or
first
fig
we
have
already
fully
considered
this
process
and
found
that
all
the
different
forms
of
it
may
be
reduced
to
one
type
the
original
equal
or
primordial
segmentation
cf
chapter
viii
in
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
vertebrates
this
palingenetic
form
of
segmentation
has
been
preserved
in
the
amphioxus
alone
all
the
other
vertebrates
having
cenogenetically
modified
forms
of
cleavage
in
any
case
the
latter
were
developed
from
the
former
and
so
the
segmentation
of
the
ovum
in
the
amphioxus
has
a
great
interest
for
us
cf
fig
the
outcome
of
this
repeated
cleavage
is
the
formation
of
a
round
cluster
of
cells
composed
of
homogeneous
indifferent
cells
of
the
simplest
character
fig
this
is
called
the
on
account
of
its
resemblance
to
a
mulberry
or
blackberry
original
or
primordial
fig
or
primordial
the
or
cytula
formed
by
fecundation
of
the
ovum
divides
by
repeated
regular
cleavage
first
into
two
then
four
then
eight
and
finally
a
large
number
of
it
is
clear
that
this
morula
reproduces
for
us
the
simple
structure
of
the
multicellular
animal
that
succeeded
the
unicellular
amœboid
form
in
the
early
laurentian
period
in
accordance
with
the
biogenetic
law
the
morula
recalls
the
ancestral
form
of
the
moræa
or
simple
colony
of
protozoa
the
first
to
be
formed
which
laid
the
early
foundation
of
the
higher
multicellular
body
must
have
consisted
of
homogeneous
and
simple
amœboid
cells
the
oldest
amœbæ
lived
isolated
lives
and
even
the
amœboid
cells
that
were
formed
by
the
segmentation
of
these
unicellular
organisms
must
have
continued
to
live
independently
for
a
long
time
but
gradually
small
communities
of
amœbæ
arose
by
the
side
of
these
eremitical
protozoa
the
produced
by
cleavage
remaining
joined
together
the
advantages
in
the
struggle
for
life
which
these
communities
had
over
the
isolated
cells
favoured
their
formation
and
their
further
development
we
find
plenty
of
these
or
communities
in
both
fresh
and
salt
water
they
belong
to
various
groups
both
of
the
protophyta
and
protozoa
morula
or
embryo
fig
or
embryo
to
have
some
idea
of
those
ancestors
of
our
race
that
succeeded
phylogenetically
to
the
moræada
we
have
only
to
follow
the
further
embryonic
development
of
the
morula
we
then
see
that
the
social
cells
of
the
round
cluster
secrete
a
sort
of
jelly
or
a
watery
fluid
inside
their
globular
body
and
they
themselves
rise
to
the
surface
of
it
fig
in
this
way
the
solid
becomes
a
hollow
sphere
the
wall
of
which
is
composed
of
a
single
layer
of
cells
we
call
this
layer
the
and
the
sphere
itself
the
or
embryonic
vesicle
this
interesting
blastula
is
very
important
the
conversion
of
the
morula
into
a
hollow
ball
proceeds
on
the
same
lines
originally
in
the
most
diverse
for
instance
in
many
of
the
zoophytes
and
worms
the
ascidia
many
of
the
echinoderms
and
molluscs
and
in
the
amphioxus
moreover
in
the
animals
in
which
we
do
not
find
a
real
palingenetic
blastula
the
defect
is
clearly
due
to
cenogenetic
causes
such
as
the
formation
of
and
other
embryonic
adaptations
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
the
ontogenetic
blastula
is
the
reproduction
of
a
very
early
phylogenetic
ancestral
form
and
that
all
the
metazoa
are
descended
from
a
common
which
was
in
the
main
constructed
like
the
blastula
in
many
of
the
lower
animals
the
blastula
is
not
developed
within
the
fœtal
membranes
but
in
the
open
water
in
those
cases
each
blastodermic
cell
begins
at
an
early
stage
to
thrust
out
one
or
more
mobile
processes
the
body
swims
about
by
the
vibratory
movement
of
these
lashes
or
whips
fig
we
still
find
both
in
the
sea
and
in
fresh
water
various
kinds
of
primitive
multicellular
organisms
that
substantially
resemble
the
blastula
in
structure
and
may
be
regarded
in
a
sense
as
permanent
vesicles
or
gelatinous
balls
with
a
wall
composed
of
a
single
layer
of
ciliated
homogeneous
cells
there
are
of
this
kind
even
among
the
familiar
volvocina
formerly
classed
with
the
infusoria
the
common
is
found
in
the
ponds
in
the
small
green
gelatinous
globule
swimming
about
by
means
of
the
stroke
of
its
lashes
which
rise
in
pairs
from
the
cells
on
its
surface
in
the
similar
halosphæra
also
which
we
find
in
the
marine
plancton
floating
matter
a
number
of
green
cells
form
a
simple
layer
at
the
surface
of
the
gelatinous
ball
but
in
this
case
there
are
no
cilia
some
of
the
infusoria
of
the
magosphæra
etc
are
similar
in
structure
to
these
vegetal
clusters
but
differ
in
their
animal
nutrition
they
form
the
special
group
of
the
in
september
i
studied
the
development
of
one
of
these
graceful
animals
on
the
island
of
off
the
coast
of
norway
figures
and
the
body
is
a
gelatinous
ball
with
its
wall
composed
of
to
ciliated
cells
it
swims
about
freely
in
the
sea
after
reaching
maturity
the
community
is
dissolved
each
cell
then
lives
independently
for
some
time
grows
and
changes
into
a
creeping
amœba
this
afterwards
contracts
and
clothes
itself
with
a
structureless
membrane
the
cell
then
looks
just
like
an
ordinary
animal
ovum
when
it
has
been
in
this
condition
for
some
time
the
cell
divides
into
two
four
eight
sixteen
and
cells
these
arrange
themselves
in
a
round
vesicle
thrust
out
vibratory
lashes
burst
the
capsule
and
swim
about
in
the
same
with
which
we
started
this
completes
the
of
the
remarkable
and
instructive
animal
if
we
compare
these
permanent
blastulæ
with
the
ciliated
larvæ
or
blastulæ
with
similar
construction
of
many
of
the
lower
animals
we
can
confidently
deduce
from
them
that
there
was
a
very
early
and
common
of
substantially
the
same
structure
as
the
blastula
we
may
call
it
the
its
body
consisted
when
fully
formed
of
a
simple
hollow
ball
filled
with
fluid
or
structureless
jelly
with
a
wall
composed
of
a
single
stratum
of
ciliated
cells
there
were
probably
many
genera
and
species
of
these
blastæads
in
the
laurentian
period
forming
a
special
class
of
marine
protists
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
in
the
plant
kingdom
also
the
simple
hollow
sphere
is
found
to
be
an
elementary
form
of
the
multicellular
organism
at
the
surface
and
below
the
surface
down
to
a
depth
of
yards
of
the
sea
there
are
green
globules
swimming
about
with
a
wall

it

existed

proved
with
certainty
by
the
gastrula

we
find
temporarily

the
metazoa

we
saw

original

simple

the

in
explaining
the
phylogenetic
origin
of
the

the
light
of
this
ontogenetic
process

may
assume
that
the
of
the
blastæa
began
to
take
in
food
more
largely
at
one
particular
part
of

natural
selection

to
the
formation
of
a
depression

pit
at
this
alimentary
spot

the
surface
of
the

the
depression
would
grow
deeper
and
deeper
in
time
the
vegetal
function
of
taking
in
and
digesting
food
would
be
confined
to
the

lined

the

this
involved
the
severance

shown
already
chapters

that
the

be
reduced

gastrula

important

justifies
us
in
concluding
in

law
that
their

also
were

as

do
probably
it
differed
from
the
existing
gastrula
only
in
one
essential
point
though
extinct
millions
of
years
ago
we
have
reason
from
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
to
believe
that
it
multiplied
by
sexual
generation

merely
asexually
by
cleavage

spores

was
no
doubt
the
case
with
the
earlier
ancestors
some
of
the
cells
of
the
primary
probably
became
ova
and
others
fertilising
sperm
we
base
these
hypotheses
on
the
fact
that
we
do
find
the
simplest
form
of
sexual
reproduction
in
some
of
the
living
gastræads

other
lower

fact
that

of

an
organisation
little
higher
than
that
of
the
hypothetical
gastræa
is
a
strong
point
in
favour
of
our
theory
there
are
not
very
many
species
of
these
living
gastræads

their
morphological
and
phylogenetic
interest
is
so
great
and
their
intermediate
position
between
the
protozoa
and
metazoa
so
instructive
that
i
proposed
long
ago
to
make
a
special
class
of
them

distinguished
three
orders
in
this
gastremaria

cyemaria

might
also
regard
these
three
orders
as
so
many
independent
classes

primitive
gastræad

cyemaria

of

our
ancestors
the
gastræa
theory
has
now
convinced
us
that
all
the
metazoa
or
multicellular
animals
can
be
traced
to
a
common
the
gastræa
in
accordance
with
the
biogenetic
law
we
find
solid
proof
of
this
in
the
fact
that
the
embryos
of
all
the
metazoa
can
be
reduced
to
a
primitive
common
type
the
gastrula
just
as
the
countless
species
of
the
metazoa
do
actually
develop
in
the
individual
from
the
simple
embryonic
form
of
the
gastrula
so
they
have
all
descended
in
past
time
from
the
common
of
the
gastræa
in
this
fact
and
the
fact
we
have
already
established
that
the
gastræa
has
been
evolved
from
the
hollow
vesicle
of
the
blastæa
and
this
again
from
the
original
unicellular
we
have
obtained
a
solid
basis
for
our
study
of
evolution
the
clear
path
from
the
to
the
gastrula
represents
the
first
section
of
our
human
chapters
viii
ix
and
xix
the
second
section
that
leads
from
the
gastræa
to
the
prochordonia
is
much
more
difficult
and
obscure
by
the
prochordonia
we
mean
the
ancient
and
animals
which
the
important
embryonic
form
of
the
chordula
proves
to
have
once
existed
cf
figs
the
nearest
of
living
animals
to
this
embryonic
structure
are
the
lowest
tunicates
the
copelata
and
the
larvæ
of
the
ascidia
as
both
the
tunicates
and
the
vertebrates
develop
from
the
same
chordula
we
may
infer
that
there
was
a
corresponding
common
ancestor
of
both
stems
we
may
call
this
the
and
the
corresponding
the
or
from
this
important
of
the
unarticulated
prochordonia
or
the
stems
of
the
tunicates
and
vertebrates
have
been
divergently
evolved
we
shall
see
presently
how
this
conclusion
is
justified
in
the
present
condition
of
morphological
science
we
have
first
to
answer
the
difficult
and
question
of
the
development
of
the
chordæa
from
the
gastræa
in
other
words
and
by
what
transformations
were
the
characteristic
animals
resembling
the
embryonic
chordula
which
we
regard
as
the
common
of
all
the
chordonia
both
tunicates
and
vertebrates
evolved
from
the
simplest
metazoa
the
descent
of
the
vertebrates
from
the
articulates
has
been
maintained
by
a
number
of
zoologists
during
the
last
thirty
years
with
more
zeal
than
discernment
and
as
a
vast
amount
has
been
written
on
the
subject
we
must
deal
with
it
to
some
extent
all
three
classes
of
articulates
in
succession
have
been
awarded
the
honour
of
being
considered
the
of
the
vertebrates
first
the
annelids
leeches
and
the
like
then
the
crustacea
crabs
etc
and
finally
the
tracheata
spiders
insects
the
most
popular
of
these
hypotheses
was
the
annelid
theory
which
derived
the
vertebrates
from
the
worms
it
was
almost
simultaneously
formulated
by
carl
semper
of
würtzburg
and
anton
dohrn
of
naples
the
latter
advanced
this
theory
originally
in
favour
of
the
failing
degeneration
theory
with
which
i
dealt
in
my
work
and
methods
of
modern
this
interesting
degeneration
discussed
at
that
time
but
almost
forgotten
formed
in
with
the
aim
of
harmonising
the
results
of
evolution
and
darwinism
with
religious
belief
the
spirited
struggle
that
darwin
had
occasioned
by
the
reformation
of
the
theory
of
descent
in
and
that
lasted
for
a
decade
with
varying
fortunes
in
every
branch
of
biology
was
drawing
to
a
close
in
and
soon
ended
in
the
complete
victory
of
transformism
to
most
of
the
disputants
the
chief
point
was
not
the
general
question
of
evolution
but
the
particular
one
of
place
in
question
of
questions
as
huxley
rightly
called
it
it
was
soon
evident
to
every
thinker
that
this
question
could
only
be
answered
in
the
sense
of
our
anthropogeny
by
admitting
that
man
had
descended
from
a
long
series
of
vertebrates
by
gradual
modification
and
improvement
in
this
way
the
real
affinity
of
man
and
the
vertebrates
came
to
be
admitted
on
all
hands
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
spoke
too
clearly
for
their
testimony
to
be
ignored
any
longer
but
in
order
still
to
save
unique
position
and
especially
the
dogma
of
personal
immortality
a
number
of
natural
philosophers
and
theologians
discovered
an
admirable
way
of
escape
in
the
of
granting
the
affinity
they
turned
the
whole
evolutionary
theory
upside
down
and
boldly
contended
that
is
not
the
most
highly
developed
animal
but
the
animals
are
degenerate
it
is
true
that
man
is
closely
related
to
the
ape
and
belongs
to
the
vertebrate
stem
but
the
chain
of
his
ancestry
goes
upward
instead
of
downward
in
the
beginning
created
man
in
his
own
image
as
the
prototype
of
the
perfect
vertebrate
but
in
consequence
of
original
sin
the
human
race
sank
so
low
that
the
apes
branched
off
from
it
and
afterwards
the
lower
vertebrates
when
this
theory
of
degeneration
was
consistently
developed
its
supporters
were
bound
to
hold
that
the
entire
animal
kingdom
was
descended
from
the
debased
children
of
men
this
theory
was
most
strenuously
defended
by
the
catholic
priest
and
natural
philosopher
michelis
in
his
an
academic
protest
against
in
still
more
and
somewhat
mystic
form
the
theory
was
advanced
by
a
natural
philosopher
of
the
older
jena
mathematician
and
physicist
carl
snell
but
it
received
its
chief
support
on
the
zoological
side
from
anton
dohrn
who
maintained
the
anthropocentric
ideas
of
snell
with
particular
ability
the
amphioxus
which
modern
science
now
almost
unanimously
regards
as
the
real
primitive
vertebrate
the
ancient
model
of
the
original
vertebrate
structure
is
according
to
dohrn
a
late
degenerate
descendant
of
the
stem
the
of
the
vertebrate
family
it
has
descended
from
the
cyclostoma
by
a
profound
degeneration
and
these
in
turn
from
the
fishes
even
the
ascidia
and
the
whole
of
the
tunicates
are
merely
degenerate
fishes
following
out
this
curious
theory
dohrn
came
to
contest
the
general
belief
that
the
cœlenterata
and
worms
are
he
even
declared
that
the
unicellular
protozoa
were
degenerate
cœlenterata
in
his
opinion
is
the
great
principle
that
explains
the
existence
of
all
the
lower
if
this
theory
were
true
and
all
animals
were
really
degenerate
descendants
of
an
originally
perfect
humanity
man
would
assuredly
be
the
true
centre
and
goal
of
all
terrestrial
life
his
anthropocentric
position
and
his
immortality
would
be
saved
unfortunately
this
trustful
theory
is
in
such
flagrant
contradiction
to
all
the
known
facts
of
paleontology
and
embryology
that
it
is
no
longer
worth
serious
scientific
consideration
but
the
case
is
no
better
for
the
descent
of
the
vertebrates
from
the
annelids
which
dohrn
afterwards
maintained
with
great
zeal
of
late
years
this
hypothesis
which
raised
so
much
dust
and
controversy
has
been
entirely
abandoned
by
most
competent
zoologists
even
those
who
once
supported
it
its
chief
supporter
dohrn
admitted
in
that
it
is
and
buried
and
made
a
blushing
retraction
at
the
end
of
his
of
the
early
history
of
the
now
that
the
is
and
buried
and
other
attempts
to
derive
the
vertebrates
from
medusæ
echinoderms
or
molluscs
have
been
equally
unsuccessful
there
is
only
one
hypothesis
left
to
answer
the
question
of
the
origin
of
the
hypothesis
that
i
advanced
years
ago
and
called
the
in
view
of
its
sound
establishment
and
its
profound
significance
it
may
very
well
claim
to
be
a
and
so
should
be
described
as
the
chordonia
or
chordæa
theory
i
first
advanced
this
theory
in
a
series
of
university
lectures
in
from
which
the
of
was
composed
in
the
first
edition
of
this
work
i
endeavoured
to
prove
on
the
strength
of
discoveries
that
all
the
animals
known
to
us
the
tunicates
are
undoubtedly
the
nearest
of
the
vertebrates
they
are
the
most
closely
related
to
the
vermalia
from
which
the
vertebrates
have
been
evolved
naturally
i
do
not
mean
that
the
vertebrates
have
descended
from
the
tunicates
but
that
the
two
groups
have
sprung
from
a
common
root
it
is
clear
that
the
real
vertebrates
primarily
the
acrania
were
evolved
in
very
early
times
from
a
group
of
worms
from
which
the
degenerate
tunicates
also
descended
in
another
and
retrogressive
this
common
extinct
are
the
prochordonia
we
still
have
a
silhouette
of
them
in
the
of
the
vertebrates
and
tunicates
and
they
still
exist
independently
in
very
modified
form
in
the
class
of
the
copelata
fig
the
received
the
most
valuable
and
competent
support
from
carl
gegenbaur
this
able
comparative
morphologist
defended
it
in
in
the
second
edition
of
his
of
comparative
at
the
same
time
he
drew
attention
to
the
important
relations
of
the
tunicates
to
a
curious
worm
he
rightly
regards
this
as
the
representative
of
a
special
class
of
worms
which
he
called
gegenbaur
referred
on
many
other
occasions
to
the
close
of
the
tunicates
and
vertebrates
and
luminously
explained
the
reasons
that
justify
us
in
framing
the
hypothesis
of
the
descent
of
the
two
stems
from
a
common
ancestor
an
unsegmented
animal
with
an
axial
chorda
between
the
dorsal
and
the
ventral
the
theory
afterwards
received
a
good
deal
of
support
from
the
research
made
by
a
number
of
distinguished
zoologists
and
anatomists
especially
kupffer
hatschek
balfour
van
beneden
and
julin
since
of
the
development
of
the
gave
us
full
information
as
to
the
embryology
of
this
lowest
vertebrate
it
has
become
so
important
for
our
purpose
that
we
must
consider
it
a
document
of
the
first
rank
for
answering
the
question
we
are
dealing
with
the
ontogenetic
facts
that
we
gather
from
this
sole
survivor
of
the
acrania
are
the
more
valuable
for
phylogenetic
purposes
as
paleontology
unfortunately
throws
no
light
whatever
on
the
origin
of
the
vertebrates
their
invertebrate
ancestors
were
soft
organisms
without
skeleton
and
thus
incapable
of
fossilisation
as
is
still
the
case
with
the
lowest
acrania
and
cyclostoma
the
same
applies
to
the
greater
part
of
the
vermalia
or
animals
the
various
classes
and
orders
of
which
differ
so
much
in
structure
the
isolated
groups
of
this
rich
stem
are
living
branches
of
a
huge
tree
the
greater
part
of
which
has
long
been
dead
and
we
have
no
fossil
evidence
as
to
its
earlier
form
nevertheless
some
of
the
surviving
groups
are
very
instructive
and
give
us
clear
indications
of
the
way
in
which
the
chordonia
were
developed
from
the
vermalia
and
these
from
the
cœlenteria
while
we
seek
the
most
important
of
these
palingenetic
forms
among
the
groups
of
cœlenteria
and
vermalia
it
is
understood
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
must
be
regarded
as
an
unchanged
or
even
little
changed
copy
of
the
extinct
one
group
has
retained
one
feature
another
a
different
feature
of
the
original
organisation
and
other
organs
have
been
further
developed
and
characteristically
modified
hence
here
more
than
in
any
other
part
of
our
genealogical
tree
we
have
to
keep
before
our
mind
the
of
development
and
separate
the
unessential
secondary
phenomena
from
the
essential
and
primary
it
will
be
useful
first
to
point
out
the
chief
advances
in
organisation
by
which
the
simple
gastræa
gradually
became
the
more
developed
chordæa
we
find
our
first
solid
datum
in
the
gastrula
of
the
amphioxus
figure
its
bilateral
and
type
indicates
that
the
common
ancestors
of
all
the
at
an
early
stage
into
two
divergent
groups
the
gastræa
became
sessile
and
gave
rise
to
two
stems
the
sponges
and
the
cnidaria
the
latter
all
reducible
to
simple
polyps
like
the
hydra
but
the
gastræa
assumed
a
certain
pose
or
direction
of
the
body
on
account
of
its
swimming
or
creeping
movement
and
in
order
to
sustain
this
it
was
a
great
advantage
to
share
the
burden
equally
between
the
two
halves
of
the
body
right
and
left
thus
arose
the
typical
bilateral
form
which
has
three
axes
the
same
bilateral
type
is
found
in
all
our
artificial
means
of
ships
etc
it
is
by
far
the
best
for
the
movement
of
the
body
in
a
certain
direction
and
steady
position
hence
natural
selection
early
developed
this
bilateral
type
in
a
section
of
the
gastræads
and
thus
produced
the
of
all
the
bilateral
animals
the
bilateralis
of
which
we
may
conceive
the
bilateral
gastrula
of
the
amphioxus
to
be
a
palingenetic
reproduction
represented
the
organism
of
the
earliest
metazoa
in
its
simplest
form
the
vegetal
entoderm
that
lined
their
simple
served
for
nutrition
the
ciliated
ectoderm
that
formed
the
external
skin
attended
to
locomotion
and
sensation
finally
the
two
primitive
mesodermic
cells
that
lay
to
the
right
and
left
at
the
ventral
border
of
the
primitive
mouth
were
sexual
cells
and
effected
reproduction
in
order
to
understand
the
further
development
of
the
gastræa
we
must
pay
particular
attention
to
the
careful
study
of
the
embryonic
stages
of
the
amphioxus
that
lie
between
the
gastrula
and
the
chordula
the
morphological
study
of
the
simplest
platodes
and
and
several
groups
of
unarticulated
vermalia
nemertina
we
have
to
consider
the
platodes
first
because
they
are
on
the
border
between
the
two
principal
groups
of
the
metazoa
the
cœlenteria
and
the
cœlomaria
with
the
former
they
share
the
lack
of
anus
and
vascular
system
with
the
latter
they
have
in
common
the
bilateral
type
the
possession
of
a
pair
of
nephridia
or
renal
canals
and
the
formation
of
a
vertical
brain
or
cerebral
ganglion
it
is
now
usual
to
distinguish
four
classes
of
platodes
the
two
classes
of
the
primitive
worms
and
the
and
the
two
parasitic
classes
of
the
suctorial
worms
and
the
we
have
only
to
consider
the
first
two
of
these
classes
the
other
two
are
parasites
and
have
descended
from
the
former
by
adaptation
to
parasitic
habits
and
consequent
degeneration
the
primitive
worms
are
very
small
flat
worms
of
simple
construction
but
of
great
morphological
and
phylogenetic
interest
they
have
been
hitherto
as
a
rule
regarded
as
a
special
order
of
the
and
associated
with
the
but
they
differ
considerably
from
these
and
all
the
other
platodes
flat
worms
in
the
absence
of
renal
canals
and
a
special
central
nervous
system
the
structure
of
their
tissue
is
also
simpler
than
in
the
other
platodes
most
of
the
platodes
of
this
group
amphichœrus
convoluta
schizoprora
etc
are
very
soft
and
delicate
animals
swimming
about
in
the
sea
by
means
of
a
ciliary
coat
and
very
small
to
inch
long
their
oval
body
without
appendages
is
sometimes
or
cylindrical
sometimes
flat
and
their
skin
is
merely
a
layer
of
ciliated
ectodermic
cells
under
this
is
a
soft
medullary
substance
which
consists
of
entodermic
cells
with
vacuoles
the
food
passes
through
the
mouth
directly
into
this
digestive
medullary
substance
in
which
we
do
not
generally
see
any
permanent
it
may
have
entirely
collapsed
hence
these
primitive
platodes
have
been
called
without
or
cœlom
or
more
correctly
or
the
sexual
organs
of
these
hermaphroditic
platodaria
are
very
pairs
of
strings
of
cells
the
inner
of
which
the
ovaries
fig
produce
ova
and
the
outer

spermaria
these
gonads
are
not
yet
independent

glands

sexually
differentiated

of
the
platodaria
have
not
the
muscular

is
very
advanced
in
the

on
the
other

they
have
as
a
rule
before

behind
the

a
bulbous

many
of
them
have

that

very
interesting

to
a

these
principles
i
assume
that
the
oldest
and

turbellaria
arose
from
platodaria
and
these
directly
from
bilateral
gastræads
the
chief
advances
were
the
formation
of
gonads
and
nephridia
and
of
the
rudimentary
brain
on
this
hypothesis
which
i
advanced
in
in
the
first
sketch
of
the
on

is
no
direct
affinity
between
the
platodes

to
the
ancient
of
the
turbellaria

a
number
of
more
recent
chordonia
ancestors

we
class
with
the
or
the
unarticulated
worms
these
true
worms
lately
also
called
are
the
difficulty
or
the
of
the
zoological
classifier
because
the
various
classes
have
very
complicated
relations
to
the
lower
platodes
on
the
one
hand
and
the
more
advanced
animals
on
the
other
but
if
we
exclude
the
platodes
and
the
annelids
from
this
stem
we
find
a
fairly
satisfactory
unity
of
organisation
in
the
remaining
classes
among
these
worms
we
find
some
important
forms
that
show
considerable
advance
in
organisation
from
the
platode
to
the
chordonia
stage
three
of
these
phenomena
are
particularly
instructive
the
formation
of
a
true
secondary
cœloma
the
formation
of
a
second
aperture
of
the
gut
the
anus
and
the
formation
of
a
vascular
system
the
great
majority
of
the
vermalia
have
these
three
features

they
are
all
wanting

close

the

differ
from
them

in
the

further
the

at

from

descent
of
the
three
groups
with
all
the
more
confidence
when
we
find
the
approaching
the
chordonia
in
other
respects
thus
for
instance
the
chief
part
of
the
central
nervous
system
is
a
long
dorsal
neural
string
that
runs
above
the
gut

the

of
all
extant
invertebrate
animals
the
enteropneusts
come
nearest
to
the
chordonia
in
virtue
of
these
peculiar
characters
hence
we
may
regard
them
as
the
survivors
of
the
ancient
vermalia
from
which
the
chordonia
also
have
descended
again

all
the

the

approach
nearest

both
are
on
the
other
hand
very
closely
related
to
the
the
primitive
vertebrate
of
which
we
have
considered
the
importance
chapters
xvi
and
xvii
as
we
saw
there
the
unarticulated
tunicates
and
the
articulated
vertebrates
must
be
regarded
as
two
independent
stems
that
have
developed
in
divergent
directions
but
the
common
root
of
the
two
stems
the
extinct
group
of
the
prochordonia
must
be
sought
in
the
vermalia
stem
and
of
all
the
living
vermalia
those
we
have
considered
give
us
the
safest
clue
to
their
origin
it
is
true
that
the
actual
representatives
of
the
important
groups
of
the
copelata
balanoglossi
nemertina
icthydina
have
more
or
less
departed
from
the
primitive
model
owing
to
adaptation
to
special
environment
but
we
may
just
as
confidently
affirm
that
the
main
features
of
their
organisation
have
been
preserved
by
heredity
we
must
grant
however
that
in
the
whole
of
the
vertebrates
the
long
stretch
from
the
gastræads
and
platodes
up
to
the
oldest
chordonia
remains
by
far
the
most
obscure
section
we
might
frame
another
hypothesis
to
raise
the
that
there
was
a
long
series
of
very
different
and
totally
extinct
forms
between
the
gastræa
and
the
chordæa
even
in
this
modified
the
six
fundamental
organs
of
the
chordula
would
retain
their
great
value
the
medullary
tube
would
be
originally
a
chemical
sensory
organ
a
dorsal
olfactory
tube
taking
in
and
food
by
the
neuroporus
in
front
and
conveying
them
by
the
neurenteric
canal
into
the
primitive
gut
this
olfactory
tube
would
afterwards
become
the
nervous
centre
while
the
expanding
gonads
lying
to
right
and
left
of
the
primitive
mouth
would
form
the
cœloma
the
chorda
may
have
been
originally
a
digestive
glandular
groove
in
the
dorsal
middle
line
of
the
primitive
gut
the
two
secondary
mouth
and
anus
may
have
arisen
in
various
ways
by
change
of
functions
in
any
case
we
should
ascribe
the
same
high
value
to
the
chordula
as
we
did
before
to
the
gastrula

explain

our

our
task
of
detecting
the
extinct
ancestors
of
our
race
among
the
vast
numbers
of
animals
known
to
us
encounters
very
different
difficulties
in
the
various
sections
of
these
were
very
great
in
the
series
of
our
invertebrate
ancestors
they
are
much
slighter
in
the
subsequent
series
of
our
vertebrate
ancestors
within
the
vertebrate
stem
there
is
as
we
have
already
seen
so
complete
an
agreement
in
structure
and
embryology
that
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
their
phylogenetic
unity
in
this
case
the
evidence
is
much
clearer
and
more
abundant
the
characteristics
that
distinguish
the
vertebrates
as
a
whole
from
the
invertebrates
have
already
been
discussed
in
our
description
of
the
hypothetical
primitive
vertebrate
chapter
xi
figs
the
chief
of
these
are
the
evolution
of
the
primitive
brain
into
a
dorsal
medullary
tube
the
formation
of
the
chorda
between
the
medullary
tube
and
the
gut
the
division
of
the
gut
into
branchial
gill
and
hepatic
liver
gut
and
the
internal
articulation
or
metamerism
the
first
three
features
are
shared
by
the
vertebrates
with
the
and
the
prochordonia
the
fourth
is
peculiar
to
them
thus
the
chief
advantage
in
organisation
by
which
the
earliest
vertebrates
took
precedence
of
the
unsegmented
chordonia
consisted
in
the
development
of
internal
segmentation
the
whole
vertebrate
stem
divides
first
into
the
two
chief
sections
of
acrania
and
craniota
the
amphioxus
is
the
only
surviving
representative
of
the
older
and
lower
section
the
acrania
all
the
other
vertebrates
belong
to
the
second
division
the
craniota
the
craniota
descend
directly
from
the
acrania
and
these
from
the
primitive
chordonia
the
exhaustive
study
that
we
made
of
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
ascidia
and
the
amphioxus
has
proved
these
relations
for
us
see
chapters
xvi
and
xvii
the
amphioxus
the
lowest
vertebrate
and
the
ascidia
the
nearest
related
invertebrate
descend
from
a
common
extinct
the
chordæa
and
this
must
have
had
substantially
the
organisation
of
the
chordula
however
the
amphioxus
is
important
not
merely
because
it
fills
the
deep
gulf
between
the
invertebrates
and
vertebrates
but
also
because
it
shows
us
the
typical
vertebrate
in
all
its
simplicity
we
owe
to
it
the
most
important
data
that
we
proceed
on
in
reconstructing
the
gradual
historical
development
of
the
whole
stem
all
the
craniota
descend
from
a
common
and
this
was
substantially
identical
in
structure
with
the
amphioxus
this
the
primitive
vertebrate
figs
had
the
characteristics
of
the
vertebrate
as
such
but
not
the
important
features
that
distinguish
the
craniota
from
the
acrania
though
the
amphioxus
has
many
peculiarities
of
structure
and
has
much
degenerated
and
though
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
an
unchanged
descendant
of
the
primitive
vertebrate
it
must
have
inherited
from
it
the
specific
characters
we
enumerated
above
we
may
not
say
that
is
the
ancestor
of
the
but
we
can
say
is
the
nearest
relation
to
the
ancestor
of
all
the
animals
we
both
belong
to
the
same
small
family
or
lowest
class
of
the
vertebrates
that
we
call
the
acrania
in
our
genealogical
tree
this
group
forms
the
twelfth
stage
or
the
first
stage
among
the
vertebrate
ancestors
from
this
group
of
acrania
both
the
amphioxus
and
the
craniota
were
evolved
the
vast
division
of
the
craniota

all
the
vertebrates
known
to
us
with
the
exception
of
the
amphioxus
all
of
them
have
a
head
clearly
differentiated
from
the
trunk
and
a
skull
enclosing
a
brain
the
head
has
also
three
pairs
of
higher
nose
eyes
and
ears
the
brain
is
very
rudimentary
at
first
a
mere
bulbous
enlargement
of
the
fore
end
of
the
medullary
tube
but
it
is
soon
divided
by
a
number
of
transverse
constrictions
into
first
three
then
five
successive
cerebral
vesicles
in
this
formation
of
the
head
skull
and
brain
with
further
development
of
the
higher
we
have
the
advance
that
the
craniota
made
beyond
their
ancestors
other
organs
also
attained
a
higher
development
they
acquired
a
compact
centralised
heart
with
valves
and
a
more
advanced
liver
and
kidneys

made
progress

other
important
respects

there
are
only
a
few
groups
of
the
former
in

now
but
they
are
very
interesting
because
in
their
whole
structure
they
stand
midway
between
the
acrania
and
the
gnathostoma
they
are
much
more
advanced
than
the
acrania
much
less
so
than
the
fishes
and
thus
form
a
very
welcome
between
the
two
groups
we
may
therefore
consider
them
a
special
intermediate
group
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
stages
in
the
series
of
our
ancestors
the
few
surviving
species
of
the
cyclostoma
are
divided
into
two
and
the
the
former
the
have
a
long
cylindrical
body
they
were
classed
by
linné
with
the
worms
and
by
later
zoologists
with
the
fishes
or
the
amphibia
or
the
molluscs
they
live
in
the
sea
usually
as
parasites
of
fishes
into
the
skin
of
which
they
bore
with
their
round
suctorial
mouths
and
their
tongues
armed
with
horny
teeth
they
are
sometimes
found
alive

they
also

attach
themselves

seems

widespread

the
class
that
is
formed

the
myxinoides

petromyzontes
is
called
the
cyclostoma

their
mouth
has
a
circular
or
aperture
the
jaws
upper
and
lower
that
we
find
in
all
the
higher
vertebrates
are
completely
wanting
in
the
cyclostoma
as
in
the
amphioxus
hence
the
other
vertebrates
are
collectively
opposed
to
them
as
gnathostoma
the
cyclostoma
might
also
be
called
because
they
have
only
a
single
nasal
passage
while
all
the
gnathostoma
have
two
nostrils
but
apart
from
these
peculiarities
the
cyclostoma
differ
more
widely
from
the
fishes
in
other
special
features
of
their
structure
than
the
fishes
do
from

they
are
obviously
the
last
survivors
of
a
very
ancient
class
of
vertebrates

was

in

must
especially
note
the
absence

very
important
organ

the
from
which
the
lungs
of
the
higher

have
been
developed
when
we
consider
all
these
peculiarities
in
the
structure
of
the
cyclostoma
we
may
formulate
the
following
thesis
two
divergent
lines
proceeded
from
the
earliest
craniota
or
the
primitive
craniota
one
of
these
lines
is
preserved
in
a
greatly
modified
condition
these
are

backward

degenerate

chief
line
of
the
vertebrate
stem
advanced
straight
to
the
fishes
and
by
fresh
adaptations
acquired
a
number
of
important
improvements
the
cyclostoma
are
almost
always
classified
by
zoologists
among
the
fishes
but
the
incorrectness
of
this
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
in
all
the
chief
and
distinctive
features
of
organisation
they
are
further
removed
from
the
fishes
than
the
fishes
are
from
the
mammals
and
even
man
with
the
fishes
we
enter
upon
the
vast
division
of
the
or
vertebrates
or
we
have
to
consider
the
fishes
carefully
as
the
class
which
on
the
evidence
of
palæontology
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
may
be
regarded
with
absolute
certainty
as
the
of
all
the
higher
vertebrates
or
gnathostomes
naturally
none
of
the
actual
fishes
can
be
considered
the
direct
ancestor
of
the
higher
vertebrates
but
it
is
certain
that
all
the
vertebrates
or
gnathostomes
from
the
fishes
to
man
descend
from
a
common
extinct
ancestor
if
we
had
this
ancient
before
us
we
would
undoubtedly
class
it
as
a
true
fish
fortunately
the
comparative
anatomy
and
classification
of
the
fishes
are
now
so
far
advanced
that
we
can
get
a
very
clear
idea
of
these
interesting
and
instructive
features

part
eye
nose
in
order
to
understand
properly
the
genealogical
tree
of
our
race
within
the
vertebrate
stem
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
characteristics
that
separate
the
whole
of
the
gnathostomes
from
the
cyclostomes
and
craniota
in
these
respects
the
fishes
agree
entirely
with
all
the
other
gnathostomes
up
to
man
and
it
is
on
this
that
we
base
our
claim
of
relationship
to
the
fishes
the
following
characteristics
of
the
gnathostomes
are
anatomic
features
of
this
kind
the
internal
apparatus
with
the
jaw
arches
the
pair
of
nostrils
the
floating
bladder
or
lungs
and
the
two
pairs
of
limbs
the
peculiar
formation
of
the
frame
work
of
the
branchial
gill
arches
and
the
connected
maxillary
jaw
apparatus
is
of
importance
in
the
whole
group
of
the
gnathostomes
it
is
inherited
in
rudimentary
form
by
all
of
them
from
the
earliest
fishes
to
man
it
is
true
that
the
primitive
transformation
which
we
find
even
in
the
ascidia
of
the
fore
gut
into
the
branchial
gut
can
be
traced
in
all
the
vertebrates
to
the
same
simple
type
in
this
respect
the
which
pierce
the
walls
of
the
branchial
gut
in
all
the
vertebrates
and
in
the
ascidia
are
very
characteristic
but
the
superficial
branchial
skeleton
that
supports
the
in
the
cyclostoma
is
replaced
in
the
gnathostomes
by
an
branchial
skeleton
it
consists
of
a
number
of
successive
cartilaginous
arches
which
lie
in
the
wall
of
the
gullet
between
the
and
run
round
the
gullet
from
both
sides
the
foremost
pair
of
become
the
maxillary
arches
from
which
we
get
our
upper
and
lower
jaws
the
olfactory
organs
are
at
first
found
in
the
same
form
in
all
the
gnathostomes
as
a
pair
of
depressions
in
the
fore
part
of
the
skin
of
the
head
above
the
mouth
hence
they
are
also
called
the
amphirhina
the
cyclostoma
are
their
nose
is
a
single
passage
in
the
middle
of
the
frontal
surface
but
as
the
olfactory
nerve
is
double
in
both
cases
it
is
possible
that
the
peculiar
form
of
the
nose
in
the
actual
cyclostomes
is
a
secondary
acquisition
by
adaptation
to
suctorial
habits

a
third
essential
character
of
the
gnathostomes
that
distinguishes
them
very
conspicuously
from
the
lower
vertebrates
we
have
dealt
with
is
the
formation
of
a
blind
sac
by
invagination
from
the
fore
part
of
the
gut
which
becomes
in
the
fishes
the
this
organ
acts
as
a
hydrostatic
apparatus
increasing
or
reducing
the
specific
gravity
of
the
fish
by
compressing
or
altering
the
quantity
of
air
in
it
the
fish
can
rise
or
sink
in
the
water
by
means
of
it
this
is
the
organ
from
which
the
lungs
of
the
higher
vertebrates
are
developed
finally
the
fourth
character
of
the
gnathostomes
in
their
simple
embryonic
form
is
the
two
pairs
of
extremities
or
pair
of
fore
legs
in
the
fish
fig
and
a
pair
of
hind
legs
ventral
fins
in
the
fish
fig
the
comparative
anatomy
of
these
fins
is
very
interesting
because
they
contain
the
rudiments
of
all
the
skeletal
parts
that
form
the
framework
of
the
fore
and
hind
legs
in
all
the
higher
vertebrates
right
up
to
man
there
is
no
trace
of
these
pairs
of
limbs
in
the
acrania
and
cyclostomes
turning
now
to
a
closer
inspection
of
the
fish
class
we
may
first
divide
it
into
three
groups
or
the
genealogy
of
which
is
well
known
to
us
the
first
and
oldest
group
is
the
of
the
or
primitive
fishes
the
representatives
of
which
are
the
orders
of
the
sharks
and
rays
figs
next
to
this
is
the
more
advanced
of
the
plated
fishes
or
figs
it
has
been
long
extinct
for
the
most
part
and
has
very
few
living
representatives
such
as
the
sturgeon
and
the
bony
pike
but
we
can
form
some
idea
of
the
earlier
extent
of
this
interesting
group
from
the
large
numbers
of
fossils
from
these
plated
fishes
the
of
the
bony
fishes
or
was
developed
to
which
the
great
majority
of
living
fishes
belong
especially
nearly
all
our
river

comparative
anatomy

ontogeny
show
clearly
that
the
ganoids
descended
from
the
selachii
and
the
teleostei
from
the
ganoids
on
the
other
hand
a
collateral
line
or
rather
the
advancing
chief
line
of
the
vertebrate
stem
was
developed
from
the
earlier
ganoids
and
this
leads
us
through
the
group
of
the
dipneusta

the
important
division

many

separate
them
altogether

regard
them
as
they

closely

this
important
advance
was

numerous
fossils

we
have
from
the
first
two
geological
sections
the
laurentian

exclusively
to
aquatic
plants

animals
from
this
paleontological
fact
in
conjunction
with
important
geological
and
biological
indications
we
may
infer
with
some
confidence
that
there
were
no
terrestrial
animals
at
that
time
during
the
whole
of
the
vast
archeozoic
millions
of
living
population
of
our
planet
consisted
almost
exclusively
of
aquatic
organisms
this
is
a
very
remarkable
fact
when
we
remember
that
this
period
embraces
the
larger
half
of
the
whole
history
of
life
the
lower

wholly
or
with
very
few
exceptions
aquatic

the
higher
stems
also
remained
in
the
water
during
the
primordial
epoch
it
was
only
towards
its
close
that
some
of
them
came
to
live
on
land
we
find
isolated
fossil
remains
of
terrestrial
animals
first
in
the
upper
silurian

in
larger
numbers
in
the
devonian
strata
which
were
deposited

the
beginning
of
the
second
chief

of
geology
the
paleozoic
age
the
number

the
vertebrate

lived

breathed
the
atmosphere
their
aquatic
ancestors
of
the
silurian

this
important
change
in
respiration
is
the
chief
modification
that
the
animal
organism
underwent
in
passing
from
the
water

the
solid
land
the
first
consequence
was
the
formation
of
lungs
for
breathing
air
up
to
that
time
the
gills

had
served
for
respiration

there
was
at
the

time
a
great
change
in
the
circulation

its
organs
these
are
always
very
closely
correlated
to
the
respiratory
organs
moreover
the
limbs
and
other
organs
were
also
more
or
less
modified

in
consequence
of
remote
correlation

new
adaptations

adapting
themselves
to
terrestrial

the
characters
of
the
two

the

the
present
in
the
first
place
we
owe
a
number
of
very
valuable
data
to
the
very
interesting
class
of
vertebrates
that
come
next
to
the
dipneusts
and
have
been
developed
from
amphibia
to
this
group
belong
the
salamander
the
frog
and
the
toad
in
earlier
days
all
the
reptiles
were
on
the
example
of
linne
classed
with
the
amphibia
lizards
serpents
crocodiles
and
tortoises
but
the
reptiles
are
much
more
advanced
than
the
amphibia
and
are
nearer
to
the
birds
in
the
chief
points
of
their
structure
the
true
amphibia
are
nearer
to
the
dipneusta
and
the
fishes
they
are
also
much
older
than
the
reptiles
there
were
plenty
of
and
sometimes
large
amphibia
during
the
carboniferous
period
but
the
earliest
reptiles
are
only
found
in
the
permian
period
it
is
probable
that
the
amphibia
were
evolved
even
the
devonian
the
dipneusta
the
extinct
amphibia
of
which
we
have
fossil
remains
from
that
remote
period
very
numerous
especially
in
the
triassic
strata
were
distinguished
for
a
graceful
scaly
coat
or
a
powerful
bony
armour
on
the
skin
like
the
crocodile
whereas
the
living
amphibia
have
usually
a
smooth
and
slippery
skin
the
earliest
of
these
armoured
amphibia
form
the
order
of
fig
it
is
among
these
and
not
among
the
actual
amphibia
that
we
must
look
for
the
forms
that
are
directly
related
to
the
genealogy
of
our
race
and
are
the
ancestors
of
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
but
even
the
existing
amphibia
have
such
important
relations
to
us
in
their
anatomic
structure
and
especially
their
embryonic
development
that
we
may
say
between
the
dipneusts
and
the
amniotes
there
was
a
series
of
extinct
intermediate
forms
which
we
should
certainly
class
with
the
amphibia
if
we
had
them
before
us
in
their
whole
organisation
even
the
actual
amphibia
seem
to
be
an
instructive
transitional
group
in
the
important
respects
of
respiration
and
circulation
they
approach
very
closely
to
the
dipneusta
though
in
other
respects
they
are
far
superior
to
them
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
development
of
their
limbs
or
extremities
in
them
we
find
these
for
the
first
time
as
feet
the
thorough
investigations
of
gegenbaur
have
shown
that
the
fins
of
which
very
erroneous
opinions
were
formerly
held
are
feet
the
various
cartilaginous
or
bony
radii
that
are
found
in
large
numbers
in
each
fin
correspond
to
the
fingers
or
toes
of
the
higher
vertebrates
the
several
joints
of
each
correspond
to
the
various
parts
of
the
toe
even
in
the
dipneusta
the
fin
is
of
the
same
construction
as
in
the
fishes
it
was
afterwards
gradually
evolved
into
the
form
which
we
first
encounter
in
the
amphibia
this
reduction
of
the
number
of
the
toes
to
six
and
then
to
five
probably
took
place
in
the
second
half
of
the
devonian
the
latest
in
the
subsequent
carboniferous
those
dipneusta
which
we
regard
as
the
ancestors
of
the
amphibia
we
have
several
fossil
remains
of
amphibia
from
this
period
there
are
numbers
of
fossil
impressions
of
them
in
the
triassic
of
thuringia
the
fact
that
the
toes
number
five
is
of
great
importance
because
they
have
clearly
been
transmitted
from
the
amphibia
to
all
the
higher
vertebrates
man
entirely
resembles
his
amphibian
ancestors
in
this
respect
and
indeed
in
the
whole
structure
of
the
bony
skeleton
of
his
extremities
a
careful
comparison
of
the
skeleton
of
the
frog
with
our
own
is
enough
to
show
this
it
is
well
known
that
this
hereditary
number
of
the
toes
has
assumed
a
very
great
practical
importance
from
remote
times
on
it
our
whole
system
of
enumeration
the
decimal
system
applied
to
measurement
of
time
mass
weight
etc
is
based
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
there
should
be
five
toes
in
the
fore
and
hind
feet
in
the
lowest
amphibia
the
reptiles
and
the
higher
vertebrates
unless
we
ascribe
it
to
inheritance
from
a
common
heredity
alone
can
explain
it
it
is
true
that
we
find
less
than
five
toes
in
many
of
the
amphibia
and
of
the
higher
vertebrates
but
in
all
these
cases
we
can
prove
that
some
of
the
toes
atrophied
and
were
in
time
lost
altogether

the

the
adult

the
causes
of
this
evolution
of
the
foot
from
the
fin
in
the
amphibian
ancestor
must
be
sought
in
adaptation
to
the
entire
change
of
function
that
the
limbs
experienced
in
passing
from
an
exclusively
aquatic
to
a
partly
terrestrial
life
the
fin
had
been
used
almost
solely
for
motion
in
the
water
it
had
now
also
to
support
the
body
in
creeping
on
the
solid
ground
this
led
to
a
modification
both
of
the
skeleton
and
the
muscles
of
the
limbs
the
number
of
the
was
gradually
reduced
and
sank
finally
to
five
but
these
five
remaining
radii
became
much
stronger
the
soft
cartilaginous
radii
became
bony
rods
the
rest
of
the
skeleton
was
similarly
strengthened
thus
from
the
lever
of
the
arose
the
improved
lever
system
of
the
amphibian
limbs
the
movements
of
the
body
gained
in
variety
as
well
as
in
strength
the
various
parts
of
the
skeletal
system
and
correlated
muscular
system
began
to
differentiate
more
and
more
in
view
of
the
close
correlation
of
the
muscular
and
nervous
systems
this
also
made
great
advance
in
structure
and
function
hence
we
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
brain
is
much
more
developed
in
the
higher
amphibia
than
in
the
fishes
the
dipneusta
and
the
lower
amphibia

the
spotted
salamander

the
gut
the
external
gills
are
gracefully
ramified
the
two
pairs
of
legs
are
still
very
small
the
first
advance
in
organisation
that
was
occasioned
by
the
adoption
of
life
on
land
was
naturally
the
construction
of
an
organ
for
breathing
lung
this
was
formed
directly
from
the
inherited
from
the
fishes
at
first
its
function
was
insignificant
beside
that
of
the
gills
the
older
organ
for
hence
we
find
in
the
lowest
amphibia
the
gilled
amphibia
that
like
the
dipneusta
they
pass
the
greater
part
of
their
life
in
the
water
and
breathe
water
through
gills
they
only
come
to
the
surface
at
brief
intervals
or
creep
on
to
the
land
and
then
breathe
air
by
their
lungs
but
some
of
the
tailed
entirely
in
the
water
when
they
are
young
and
afterwards
spend
most
of
their
time
on
land
in
the
adult
state
they
only
breathe
air
through
lungs
the
same
applies
to
the
most
advanced
of
the
amphibia
the
batrachia
frogs
and
toads
some
of
them
have
entirely
lost
the
larva
form
this
is
also
the
case
with
certain
small
serpentine
amphibia
the
cæcilia
which
live
in
the
ground
like
the
of
martinique
loses
the
gills
on
the
seventh
and
the
tail
and
on
the
eighth
day
of
fœtal
life
on
the
ninth
or
tenth
day
after
fecundation
the
frog
emerges
from
the
egg
the
great
interest
of
the
natural
history
of
the
amphibia
consists
especially
in
their
intermediate
position
between
the
lower
and
higher
vertebrates
the
lower
amphibia
approach
very
closely
to
the
dipneusta
in
their
whole
organisation
live
mainly
in
the
water
and
breathe
by
gills
but
the
higher
amphibia
are
just
as
close
to
the
amniotes
live
mainly
on
land
and
breathe
by
lungs
but
in
their
younger
state
the
latter
resemble
the
former
and
only
reach
the
higher
stage
by
a
complete
metamorphosis
the
embryonic
development
of
most
of
the
higher
amphibia
still
faithfully
reproduces
the
of
the
whole
class
and
the
various
stages
of
the
advance
that
was
made
by
the
lower
vertebrates
in
passing
from
aquatic
to
terrestrial
life
during
the
devonian
or
the
carboniferous
period
are
repeated
in
the
spring
by
every
frog
that
develops

our
ponds

from
which
the

behind
it
the
from
which
the
branching
gills
protrude
cutaneous
of
the
tail
the
common
frog
leaves
the
egg
in
the
shape
of
a
larva
like
the
tailed
salamander
fig
and
this
is
altogether
different
from
the
mature
frog
fig
the
short
trunk
ends
in
a
long
tail
with
the
form
and
structure
of
a
tail
there
are
no
limbs
at
first
the
respiration
is
exclusively
branchial
first
through
external
and
then
internal
gills
in
harmony
with
this
the
heart
has
the
same
structure
as
in
the
fish
and
consists
of
two
atrium
that
receives
the
venous
blood
from
the
body
and
a
ventricle
that
forces
it
through
the
arteries
into
the
gills
we
find
the
larvæ
of
the
frog
or
tadpoles
in
great
numbers
in
our
ponds
every
spring
in
this
using
their
muscular
tails
in
swimming
just
like
the
fishes
and
young
ascidia
when
they
have
reached
a
certain
size
the
remarkable
metamorphosis
from
the
to
the
frog
begins
a
blind
sac
grows
out
of
the
gullet
and
expands
into
a
couple
of
spacious
sacs
these
are
the
lungs
the
simple
chamber
of
the
heart
is
divided
into
two
sections
by
the
development
of
a
partition
and
there
are
at
the
same
time
considerable
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
chief
arteries
previously
all
the
blood
went
from
the
auricle
through
the
aortic
arches
into
the
gills
but
now
only
part
of
it
goes
to
the
gills
the
other
part
passing
to
the
lungs
through
the
pulmonary
artery
from
this
point
arterial
blood
returns
to
the
left
auricle
of
the
heart
while
the
venous
blood
gathers
in
the
right
auricle
as
both
auricles
open
into
a
single
ventricle
this
contains
mixed
blood
the
dipneust
form
has
now
succeeded
to
the
in
the
further
course
of
the
metamorphosis
the
gills
and
the
branchial
vessels
entirely
disappear
and
the
respiration
becomes
exclusively
pulmonary
later
the
long
swimming
tail
is
lost
and
the
frog
now
hops
to
the
land
with
the
legs
that
have
grown
meantime
this
remarkable
metamorphosis
of
the
amphibia
is
very
instructive
in
connection
with
our
human
genealogy
and
is
particularly
interesting
from
the
fact
that
the
various
groups
of
actual
amphibia
have
remained
at
different
stages
of
their
in
harmony
with
the
biogenetic
law
we
have
first
of
all
a
very
low
order
of
which
retain
their
gills
throughout
life
like
the
fishes
in
a
second
order
of
the
salamanders
the
gills
are
lost
in
the
metamorphosis
and
when
fully
grown
they
have
only
pulmonary
respiration
some
of
the
tailed
amphibia
still
retain
the
in
the
side
of
the
neck
though
they
have
lost
the
gills
themselves
if
we
force
the
larvæ
of
our
salamanders
fig
and
tritons
to
remain
in
the
water
and
prevent
them
from
reaching
the
land
we
can
in
favourable
circumstances
make
them
retain
their
gills
in
this
condition
they
reach
sexual
maturity
and
remain
throughout
life
at
the
lower
stage
of
the
gilled
amphibia
axolotl
it
was
formerly
regarded
as
a
permanent
gilled
amphibian
persisting
throughout
life

the
but
some
of
the
hundreds
of
these
animals
that
are
kept
in
the
botanical
garden
at
paris
got
on
to
the
land
for
some
reason
or
other
lost
their
gills
and
changed
into
a
form
closely
resembling
the
salamander
other
species
of
the
genus
became
sexually
mature
for
the
first
time
in
this
condition
this
has
been
regarded
as
an
astounding
phenomenon
although
every
common
frog
and
salamander
repeats
the
metamorphosis
in
the
spring
the
whole
change
from
the
aquatic
and
animal
to
the
terrestrial
form
may
be
followed
step
by
step
in
this
case
but
what
we
see
here
in
the
development
of
the
individual
has
happened
to
the
whole
class
in
the
course
of
its
fossil
mailed
amphibian
from
the
bohemian
carboniferous
seeleya
fig
mailed
amphibian
from
the
bohemian
carboniferous
from
the
scaly
coat
is
retained
on
the
left
the
metamorphosis
goes
farther
in
a
third
order
of
amphibia
the
or
than
in
the
salamander
to
this
belong
the
various
kinds
of
toads
ringed
snakes
etc
these
lose
not
only
the
gills
but
also
sooner
or
later
the
tail
during
metamorphosis
the
ontogenetic
loss
of
the
gills
and
the
tail
in
the
frog
and
toad
can
only
be
explained
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
descended
from
amphibia
of
the
salamander
type
this
is
also
clear
from
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
two
groups
this
remarkable
metamorphosis
is
however
also
interesting
because
it
throws
a
certain
light
on
the
phylogeny
of
the
apes
and
man
their
ancestors
also
had
long
tails
and
gills
like
the
gilled
amphibia
as
the
tail
and
the
of
the
human
embryo
clearly
show
for
comparative
anatomical
and
ontogenetic
reasons
we
must
not
seek
these
amphibian
ancestors
of
one
would
be
inclined
to
do
the
batrachia
but
among
the
tailed
lower
amphibia
the
vertebrate
form
that
comes
next
to
the
amphibia
in
the
series
of
our
ancestors
is
a
animal
the
earlier
existence
of
which
can
be
confidently
deduced
from
the
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
the
living
of
new
zealand
fig
and
the
extinct
of
the
permian
period
fig
are
closely
related
to
this
important
we
may
call
them
the
or
primitive
amniotes
all
the
vertebrates
above
the
the
three
classes
of
reptiles
birds
and
so
much
in
their
whole
organisation
from
all
the
lower
vertebrates
we
have
yet
considered
and
have
so
great
a
resemblance
to
each
other
that
we
put
them
all
together
in
a
single
group
with
the
title
of
in
these
three
classes
alone
we
find
the
remarkable
embryonic
membrane
already
mentioned
which
we
called
the
a
cenogenetic
adaptation
that
we
may
regard
as
a
result
of
the
sinking
of
the
growing
embryo
into
the
all
the
amniotes
known
to
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
including
man
in
so
many
important
points
of
internal
structure
and
development
that
their
descent
from
a
common
ancestor
can
be
affirmed
with
tolerable
certainty
if
the
evidence
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
is
ever
entirely
beyond
suspicion
it
is
certainly
the
case
here
all
the
peculiarities
that
accompany
and
follow
the
formation
of
the
amnion
and
that
we
have
learned
in
our
consideration
of
human
embryology
all
the
peculiarities
in
the
development
of
the
organs
which
we
will
presently
follow
in
detail
finally
all
the
principal
special
features
of
the
internal
structure
of
the
so
clearly
the
common
origin
of
all
the
amniotes
from
single
extinct
that
it
is
difficult
to
entertain
the
idea
of
their
evolution
from
several
independent
stems
this
unknown
common
is
our
primitive
amniote
in
outward
appearance
it
was
probably
something
between
the
salamander
and
the
lizard
it
is
very
probable
that
some
part
of
the
permian
period
was
the
age
of
the
origin
of
the
protamniotes
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
amphibia
are
not
fully
developed
until
the
carboniferous
period
and
that
the
first
fossil
reptiles
homœosaurus
are
found
towards
the
close
of
the
permian
period
among
the
important
changes
of
the
vertebrate
organisation
that
marked
the
rise
of
the
first
amniotes
from
salamandrine
amphibia
during
this
period
the
following
three
are
especially
noteworthy
the
entire
disappearance
of
the
gills
and
the
conversion
of
the
into
other
organs
the
formation
of
the
allantois
or
primitive
urinary
sac
and
the
development
of
the
amnion
one
of
the
most
salient
characteristics
of
the
amniotes
is
the
complete
loss
of
the
gills
all
amniotes
even
if
living
in
water
such
as
and
whales
breathe
air
through
lungs
never
water
through
gills
all
the
amphibia
with
very
rare
exceptions
retain
their
gills
for
some
time
when
young
and
have
for
a
time
if
not
permanently
branchial
respiration
but
after
these
there
is
no
question
of
branchial
respiration
the
protamniote
itself
must
have
entirely
abandoned
nevertheless
the

preserved
by
heredity
and
develop

totally
different

part
rudimentary
parts
of
the
bone
of
the
tongue
the
frame
of
the
jaws
the
organ
of
hearing
etc
but
we
do
not
find
in
the
embryos
of
the
amniotes
any
trace
of
or
of
real
respiratory
organs
on
the
with
this
complete
abandonment
of
the
gills
is
probably
connected
the
formation
of
another
organ
to
which
we
have
already
referred
in
the
allantois
or
primitive
urinary
sac
cf
it
is
very
probable
that
the
urinary
bladder
of
the
dipneusts
is
the
first
structure
of
the
allantois
we
find
in
these
a
urinary
bladder
that
proceeds
from
the
lower
wall
of
the
hind
end
of
the
gut
and
serves
as
receptacle
for
the
renal
secretions
this
organ
has
been
transmitted
to
the
amphibia
as
we
can
see
in
the
frog
the
formation
of
the
amnion
and
the
allantois
and
the
complete
disappearance
of
the
gills
are
the
chief
characteristics
that
distinguish
the
amniotes
from
the
lower
vertebrates
we
have
hitherto
considered
to
these
we
may
add
several
subordinate
features
that
are
transmitted
to
all
the
amniotes
and
are
found
in
these
only
one
striking
embryonic
character
of
the
amniotes
is
the
great
curve
of
the
head
and
neck
in
the
embryo
we
also
find
an
advance
in
the
structure
of
several
of
the
internal
organs
of
the
amniotes
which
raises
them
above
the
highest
of
the
anamnia
in
particular
a
partition
is
formed
in
the
simple
ventricle
of
the
heart
dividing
into
right
and
left
chambers
in
connection
with
the
complete
metamorphosis
of
the
we
find
a
further
development
of
the
auscultory
organs
also
there
is
a
great
advance
in
the
structure
of
the
brain
skeleton
muscular
system
and
other
parts
finally
one
of
the
most
important
changes
is
the
reconstruction
of
the
kidneys
in
all
the
earlier
vertebrates
we
have
found
the
primitive
kidneys
as
excretory
organs
and
these
appear
at
an
early
stage
in
the
embryos
of
all
the
higher
vertebrates
up
to
man
but
in
the
amniotes
these
primitive
kidneys
cease
to
act
at
an
early
stage
of
embryonic
life
and
their
function
is
taken
up
by
the
permanent
or
secondary
kidneys
which
develop
from
the
terminal
section
of
the
prorenal
ducts
taking
all
these
peculiarities
of
the
amniotes
together
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
all
the
animals
of
this
reptiles
birds
and
a
common
origin
and
form
a
single
stem
our
own
race
belongs
to
this
stem
man
is
in
every
feature
of
his
organisation
and
embryonic
development
a
true
amniote
and
has
descended
from
the
protamniote
with
all
the
other
amniotes
though
they
appeared
at
the
end
possibly
even
in
the
middle
of
the
paleozoic
age
the
amniotes
only
reached
their
full
development
during
the
mesozoic
age
the
birds
and
mammals
made
their
first
appearance
during
this
period
even
the
reptiles
show
their
greatest
growth
at
this
time
so
that
it
is
called
reptile
the
extinct
protamniote
the
ancestor
of
the
whole

belongs
in
its
whole
organisation
to
the
reptile
class

in
its
chief
lines
by
their
paleontology
comparative

and
ontogeny
the
group
succeeding
the
protamniote
divided
into
two
branches
the
branch
that
will
claim
our
whole
interest
is
the
class
of
the
mammals
the
other
branch
which
developed
in
a
totally
different
direction
and
only
comes
in
contact
with
the
mammals
at
its
root
is
the
combined
group
of
the
reptiles
and
birds
these
two
classes
may
with
huxley
be
conveniently
grouped
together
as
the
their
common

an
extinct
reptile

the
order
of

been
developed
in

directions
the

a
word
all
the
members
of
the
reptile
class
but
the
remarkable
class
of
the
birds
has
also
been
evolved
directly
from
a
branch
of
the
reptile
group
as
is
now
established
beyond
question
the
embryos
of
the
reptiles
and
birds
are
identical
until
a
very
late
stage
and
have
an
astonishing
resemblance
even
later
their
whole
structure
agrees
so
much
that
no
anatomist
now
questions
the
descent
of
the
birds
from
the
reptiles
on
the
other
hand
the
mammal
line
has
descended
from
the
group
of
the
sauromammalia
a
different
branch
of
the
proreptilia
it
is
connected
at
its
deepest
roots
with
the
reptile
line
but
it
then
diverges
completely
from
it
and
follows
a
distinctive
development
man
is
the
highest
outcome
of
this
class
the
of
the
hypothesis
that
the
three
higher
vertebrate
classes
represent
a
single
and
that
the
common
root
of
this
stem
is

our

as
the
of
all
the
amniotes
fortunately
a
living
representative
of
this
extinct
ancestral
group
has
been
preserved
to
our
day
this
is
the
remarkable

externally
it
differs
little
from
the
ordinary
lizard
but
in
many
important
points
of
internal
structure
especially
in
the
primitive
construction
of
the
vertebral
column
the
skull
and
the
limbs
it
occupies
a
much
lower
position
and
approaches
its

the

oldest
of

isolated

little

unfortunately
the
numerous
fossil
remains
of
permian

tocosauria
that
we
have
found
in
the
last
two
decades
are
for
the
most
part
very
imperfectly
preserved
very
often
we
can
make
only
precarious
inferences
from
these
skeletal
fragments
as
to
the
anatomic
characters
of
the
soft
parts
that
went
with
the
bony
skeleton
of
the
extinct
tocosauria
hence
it
has
not
yet
been
possible
to
arrange
these
important
fossils
with
any
confidence
in
the
ancestral
series
that
descend
from
the
protamniotes
to
the
sauropsids
on
the
one
side
and
the
mammals
on
the
other
opinions
are
particularly
divided
as
to
the
place
in
classification

the
phylogenetic
significance
of
the
remarkable
cope
gives
this
name
to
a
very
interesting
and
extensive
group
of
extinct
terrestrial
reptiles
of
which
we
have
only
fossil
remains
from
the
permian
and
triassic
strata
forty
years
ago
some
of
these
therosauria
animals
were
described
by
owen
as
but
during
the
last
twenty
years
the
distinguished
american
paleontologists
cope
and
osborn
have
greatly
increased
our
knowledge
of
them
and
have
claimed
that
the
of
the
mammals
must
be
sought
in
this
order
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
theromorpha
are
nearer
to
the
mammals
in
the
chief
points
of
structure
than
any
other
reptiles
this
is
especially
true
of
the
thereodontia
to
which
the
and
belong
fig
the
whole
structure
of
their
pelvis
and
has
attained
the
same
form
as
in
the
monotremes
the
lowest
mammals
the
formation
of
the
scapula
and
the
quadrate
bone
shows
an
approach
to
the
mammals
such
as
we
find
in
no
other
group
of
reptiles
the
teeth
also
are
already
divided
into
incisors
canines
and
molars
nevertheless
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
the
theromorpha
really
are
in
the
ancestral
line
of
the
sauromammals
or
lead
direct
from
the
tocosauria
to
the
earliest
mammals
other
experts
on
this
group
believe
that
it
is
an
independent
legion
of
the
reptiles
connected
perhaps
at
its
lowest
root
with
the
sauromammals
but
developed
quite
independently
of
the
parallel
to
them
in
many
ways
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
zoological
facts
that
we
rely
on
in
our
investigation
of
the
genealogy
of
the
human
race
is
the
position
of
man
in
the
mammal
class
however
different
the
views
of
zoologists
may
have
been
as
to
this
position
in
detail
and
as
to
his
relations
to
the
apes
no
scientist
has
ever
doubted
that
man
is
a
true
mammal
in
his
whole
organisation
and
development
linné
drew
attention
to
this
fact
in
the
first
edition
of
his
famous
as
will
be
seen
in
any
museum
of
anatomy
or
any
manual
of
comparative
anatomy
the
human
frame
has
all
the
characteristics
that
are
common
to
the
mammals
and
distinguish
them
conspicuously
from
all
other
animals

if
we
examine
this
undoubted
fact
from
the
point
of
view
of
phylogeny
in
the
light
of
the
theory
of
descent
it
follows
at
once
that
man
is
of
a
common
stem
with
all
the
other
mammals
and
comes
from
the
same
root
as
they
but
the
various
features
in
which
the
mammals
agree
and
by
which
they
are
distinguished
are
of
such
a
character
as
to
make
a
polyphyletic
hypothesis
quite
inadmissible
it
is
impossible
to
entertain
the
idea
that
all
the
living
and
extinct
mammals
come
from
a
number
of
separate
roots
if
we
accept
the
general
theory
of
evolution
we
are
bound
to
admit
the
monophyletic
hypothesis
of
the
descent
of
all
the
mammals
including
man
from
a
single
mammalian
we
may
call
this
and
its
earliest
descendants
a
few
genera
of
one
family
or
as
we
have
already
seen
this
developed
from
the
primitive
proreptile
stem
in
a
totally
different
direction
from
the
birds
and
soon
separated
from
the
main
stem
of
the
reptiles
the
differences
between
the
mammals
and
the
reptiles
and
birds
are
so
important
and
characteristic
that
we
can
assume
with
complete
confidence
this
division
of
the
vertebrate
stem
at
the
commencement
of
the
development
of
the
amniotes
the
reptiles
and
birds
which
we
group
together
as
the
generally
agree
in
the
characteristic
structure
of
the
skull
and
brain
and
this
is
notably
different
from
that
of
the
mammals
in
most
of
the
reptiles
and
birds
the
skull
is
connected
with
the
first
cervical
vertebra
the
by
a
single
and
in
the
mammals
and
amphibia
by
a
double
condyle
at
the
back
of
the
head
in
the
former
the
lower
jaw
is
composed
of
several
pieces
and
connected
with
the
skull
so
that
it
can
move
by
a
special
maxillary
bone
the
in
the
mammals
the
lower
jaw
consists
of
one
pair
of
bony
pieces
which
articulate
directly
with
the
temporal
bone
further
in
the
sauropsids
the
skin
is
clothed
with
scales
or
feathers
in
the
mammals
with
hair
the
red
of
the
former
have
a
nucleus
those
of
the
latter
have
not
in
fine
two
quite
characteristic
features
of
the
mammals
which
distinguish
them
not
only
from
the
birds
and
reptiles
but
from
all
other
animals
are
the
possession
of
a
complete
diaphragm
and
of
mammary
glands
that
produce
the
milk
for
the
nutrition
of
the
young
it
is
only
in
the
mammals
that
the
diaphragm
forms
a
transverse
partition
of
the
completely
separating
the
pectoral
from
the
abdominal
cavity
it
is
only
in
the
mammals
that
the
mother
suckles
its
young
and
this
rightly
gives
the
name
to
the
whole
class

from
these

and

it
follows
absolutely
that
the
whole
of
the
mammals
belong
to
a
single
natural
stem
which
branched
off
at
an
early
date
from
the
it
follows
further
with
the
same
absolute
certainty
that
the
human
race
is
also
a
branch
of
this
stem
man
shares
all
the
characteristics
i
have
described
with
all
the
mammals
and
differs
in
them
from
all
other
animals
finally
from
these
facts
we
deduce
with
the
same
confidence
those
advances
in
the
vertebrate
organisation
by
which
one
branch
of
the
sauromammals
was
converted
into
the
of
the
mammals
of
these
advances
the
chief
were
the
characteristic
modification
of
the
skull
and
the
brain
the
development
of
a
hairy
coat
the
complete
formation
of
the
diaphragm
and
the
construction
of
the
mammary
glands
and
adaptation
to
suckling
other
important
changes
of
structure
proceeded
step
by
step
with
these
the
epoch
at
which
these
important
advances
were
made
and
the
foundation
of
the
mammal
class
was
laid
may
be
put
with
great
probability
in
the
first
section
of
the
mesozoic
or
secondary
triassic
period
the
oldest
fossil
remains
of
mammals
that
we
know
were
found
in
strata
that
belong
to
the
earliest
triassic
upper
kueper
one
of
the
earliest
forms
is
the
genus
from
the
north
american
triassic
fig
their
teeth
still
strikingly
recall
those
of
the
pelycosauria
hence
we
may
assume
that
this
small
and
probably
insectivorous
mammal
belonged
to
the
of
the
promammals
we
do
not
find
any
positive
trace
of
the
third
and
most
advanced
division
of
the
placentals
these
including
man
are
much
younger
and
we
do
not
find
indisputable
fossil
remains
of
them
until
the
cenozoic
age
or
the
tertiary
period
this
paleontological
fact
is
very
important
because
it
fully
harmonises
with
the
evolutionary
succession
of
the
mammal
orders
that
is
deduced
from
their
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
the
latter
science
teaches
us
that
the
whole
mammal
class
divides
into
three
main
groups
or
which
correspond
to
three
successive
phylogenetic
stages
these
three
stages
which
also
represent
three
important
stages
in
our
human
genealogy
were
first
distinguished
in
by
the
eminent
french
zoologist
blainville
and
received
the
names
of
didelphia
and
according
to
the
construction
of
the
female
organs
uterus
or
womb
huxley
afterwards
gave
them
the
names
of
metatheria
and
but
the
three
differ
so
widely
from
each
other
not
only
in
the
construction
of
the
sexual
organs
but
in
many
other
respects
also
that
we
may
confidently
draw
up
the
following
important
phylogenetic
thesis
the
monodelphia
or
placentals
descend
from
the
didelphia
or
marsupials
and
the
latter
in
turn
are
descended
from
the
monotremes
or
ornithodelphia
thus
we
must
regard
as
the
stage
in
our
genealogical
tree
the
earliest
and
lowest
chief
group
of
the
of
the
monotremes
ornithodelphia
or
prototheria
figs
and
they
take
their
name
from
the
cloaca
which
they
share
with
all
the
lower
vertebrates
this
cloaca
is
the
common
outlet
for
the
passage
of
the
excrements
the
urine
and
the
sexual
products
the
urinary
ducts
and
sexual
canals
open
into
the
hindmost
part
of
the
gut
while
in
all
the
other
mammals
they
are
separated
from
the
rectum
and
anus
the
latter
have
a
special
outlet
the
bladder
also
opens
into
the
cloaca
in
the
monotremes
and
indeed
apart
from
the
two
urinary
ducts
in
all
the
other
mammals
the
latter
open
directly
into
the
bladder
it
was
proved
by
haacke
and
caldwell
in
that
the
monotremes
lay
large
eggs
like
the
reptiles
while
all
the
other
mammals
are
viviparous
in
richard
semon
further
proved
that
these
large
eggs
rich
in
have
a
partial
segmentation
and
discoid
gastrulation
as
i
had
hypothetically
assumed
in
here
again
they
resemble
their
reptilian
ancestors
the
construction
of
the
mammary
gland
is
also
peculiar
in
the
monotremes
in
them
the
glands
have
no
teats
for
the
young
animal
to
suck
but
there
is
a
special
part
of
the
breast
pierced

the
marsupials
retain
a

part
of
the
characteristics
of

they
have
also
acquired
some
of
the
chief
features
of

some
features
are
also
peculiar
to
the
marsupials
such
as
the
construction
of

distinguished
by

that
bends
from

corner
of
the
lower

points
inwards

most
of
the

we
can
with
some

recognise
the

alone
most
of
the
mammal
remains
that
we
have
from
the

most
of
the

found

the
peculiar

that
characterises
the

suppose
that

have
no

a
good
deal

respects

is
now

remains
sometimes
of

colossal
size
in

even
in

we
may
infer
from
this
that
the
existing
marsupials
are
the
remnant
of
an
extensive
earlier
group
that
was
distributed
all
over
the

had
to
give
way
in

struggle
for

the

the
survivors
of
the

able
to
keep

was
completely

from

the
of

primates

must
regard

earliest

were
evolved
directly
from
the

must
not
forget
however
that
the
conversion
of
the
foot
into
a
prehensile
hand
is
polyphyletic
by
the
same
adaptation
to
climbing
trees
the
habit
of
grasping
their
branches
with
the

in
many

brought
about

opposition

the
thumb

makes

some
zoologists
have
lately
advanced
the
opposite
opinion
that
the
marsupials
represent
a
completely
independent
of
the
mammals
with
no
direct
relation
to
the
placentals

developing
independently

this
opinion
is

do
not

a

must

more

true
that
the

are
not
far
removed
from

within
the

we
can
trace

however
the
feature

is
a

secondary
difference

great
stress
has

laid
in
the
fact
that
in

the
original

of
the

quickly
degenerates

the

it
sticks

conspicuous

has
to

differ
a
good

in

to
some
extent
they
give
us
valuable
data
for
the
natural
classification
and
therefore
the
phylogeny
of
the
whole
of
this
on
the
ground
of
these
differences
we
divide
it
into
two
principal
sections
the
lower
placentals
or
and
the
higher
placentals
or
to
the
indecidua
belong
three
important
groups
of
mammals
the
lemurs
the
ungulates
tapirs
horses
pigs
ruminants
etc
and
the
cetacea
dolphins
and
whales
in
these
indecidua
the
villi
are
distributed
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
chorion
or
its
greater
part
either
singly
or
in
groups
they
are
only
loosely
connected
with
the
mucous
coat
of
the
uterus
so
that
the
whole
fœtal
membrane
with
its
villi
can
be
easily
withdrawn
from
the
uterine
depressions
like
a
hand
from
a
glove
there
is
no
real
coalescence
of
the
two
placentas
at
any
part
of
the
surface
of
contact
hence
at
birth
the
fœtal
placenta
alone
comes
away
the
uterine
placenta
is
not
torn
away
with
it
the
formation
of
the
placenta
is
very
different
in
the
second
and
higher
section
of
the
placentals
the
here
again
the
whole
surface
of
the
chorion
is
thickly
covered
with
the
villi
in
the
beginning
but
they
afterwards
disappear
from
one
part
of
the
surface
and
grow
proportionately
thicker
on
the
other
part
we
thus
get
a
differentiation
between
the
smooth
chorion
laeve
fig
and
the
chorion
frondosum
fig
the
former
has
only
a
few
small
villi
or
none
at
all
the
latter
is
thickly
covered
with
large
and
villi
this
alone
now
constitutes
the
placenta
in
the
great
majority
of
the
deciduata
the
placenta
has
the
same
shape
as
in
man
figs
and
a
thick
circular
disk
like
a
cake
so
we
find
in
the
insectivora
chiroptera
rodents
and
apes
this
lies
on
one
side
of
the
chorion
but
in
the
sarcotheria
both
the
carnivora
and
the
seals
and
in
the
elephant
and
several
other
deciduates
we
find
a
in
these
the
rich
mass
of
villi
runs
like
a
girdle
round
the
middle
of
the
ellipsoid
chorion
the
two
poles
of
it
being
free
from
them
still
more
characteristic
of
the
deciduates
is
the
peculiar
and
very
intimate
connection
between
the
and
the
corresponding
part
of
the
mucous
coat
of
the
womb
which
we
must
regard
as
a
real
coalescence
of
the
two
the
villi
of
the
chorion
push
their
branches
into
the
tissues
of
the
coat
of
the
uterus
and
the
vessels
of
each
loop
together
so
intimately
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
separate
the
fœtal
from
the
maternal
placenta
they
form
henceforth
a
compact
and
apparently
simple
placenta
in
consequence
of
this
coalescence
a
whole
piece
of
the
lining
of
the
womb
comes
away
at
birth
with
the
fœtal
membrane
that
is
interlaced
with
it
this
piece
is
called
the
membrane
it
is
also
called
the
serous
spongy
membrane
because
it
is
pierced
like
a
sieve
or
sponge
all
the
higher
placentals
that
have
this
decidua
are
classed
together
as
the
the
tearing
away
of
the
decidua
at
birth
naturally
causes
the
mother
to
lose
a
quantity
of
blood
which
does
not
happen
in
the
indecidua
the
last
part
of
the
uterine
coat
has
to
be
repaired
by
a
new
growth

that
there

elaborate

have
lately
been
fully
described
by
hans
strahl
the
phylogeny
of
the
placenta
has
become
more
intelligible
from
the
fact
that
we
have
found
a
number
of
transitional
forms
of
it
some
of
the
marsupials
have
the
beginning
of
a
placenta

some
of
the
lemurs
a
discoid
placenta
with
decidua

developed

these
important
results
of
comparative
embryology
have
been
throwing
further
light
on
the
close
of
man
and
the
anthropoid
apes
in
the
last
few
years
the
great
advance
of
paleontology
has
at
the
same
time
been
affording
us
a
deeper
insight
into
the
of
the
placental
group
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
my
phylogeny
of
the
i
advanced
the
hypothesis
that
the
placentals
form
a
single
stem
with
many
branches
which
has
been
evolved
from
an
older
group
of
the
marsupials
the
four
great
legions
of
the
ungulates
carnassia
and
sharply
separated
by
important
features
of
organisation
but
if
we
consider
their
extinct
ancestors
of
the
tertiary
period
the
differences
gradually
disappear
the
deeper
we
go
in
the
cenozoic
deposits
in
the
end
we
find
that
they
vanish
altogether
the
primitive
of
the
rodents
the
ungulates
the
carnassia
and
the
primates
are
so
closely
related
at
the
beginning
of
the
tertiary
period
that
we
might
group
them
together
as
different
families
of
one
order
the
proplacentals
or
hence
the
great
majority
of
the
placentals
have
no
direct
and
close
relationship
to
man

only
the
legion
of
the

lemurs

few
living
representatives

they
are
very
interesting
and
are
the
last
survivors

a

extensive
group

find
many
fossil
remains
of
them

the
older
tertiary
deposits

reduced

usually
have

teeth

living
survivors

scattered
far
over

southern
part
of

of
the
species
live
in
madagascar
some
in
the
sunda
islands
others
on
the
mainland
of

and

they
are
gloomy
and
melancholic
animals
they
live
a
quiet
life
climbing

eating
fruit
and

they
are
of
different
kinds
some
are

are
nearer
to

of

closely
to

true

the
numerous
fossil
remains
of
and
apes
that
have
been
recently
found
in
the
tertiary
deposits
justify
us
in
thinking
that
ancestors
were
represented
by
several
different
species
during
this
long
period
some
of
these
were
almost
as
big
as

next
to
the
lemurs
come
the
true
apes
the
stage
in
our
ancestry
it
has
been
beyond
question
for
some
time
now
that
the
apes
approach
nearest
to
man
in
every
respect
of
all
the
animals
just
as
the
lowest
apes
come
close
to
the
lemurs
so
the
highest
come
next
to
man
when
we
carefully
study
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
apes
and
man
we
can
trace
a
gradual
and
uninterrupted
advance
in
the
organisation
of
the
ape
up
to
the
purely
human
frame
and
after
impartial
examination
of
the
that
has
been
discussed
of
late
years
with
such
passionate
interest
we
come
infallibly
to
the
important
conclusion
first
formulated
by
huxley
in
systems
of
organs
we
take
the
comparison
of
their
modifications
in
the
series
of
apes
leads
to
the
same
result
that
the
anatomic
differences
that
separate
man
from
the
gorilla
and
chimpanzee
are
not
as
great
as
those
that
separate
the
gorilla
from
the
lower
translated
into
phylogenetic
language
this
formulated
in
such
masterly
fashion
by
huxley
is
quite
equivalent
to
the
popular
saying
is
descended
from
the
in
the
very
first
exposition
of
his
profound
natural
classification
linné
placed
the
anthropoid
mammals
at
the
head
of
the
animal
kingdom
with
three
genera
man
the
ape
and
the
sloth
he
afterwards
called
them
the
of
the
animal
world
he
then
also
separated
the
lemur
from
the
true
ape
and
rejected
the
sloth
later
zoologists
divided
the
order
of
primates
first
the
gottingen
anatomist
blumenbach
founded
a
special
order
for
man
which
he
called
in
a
second
order
he
united
the
apes
and
lemurs
under
the
name
of
and
a
third
order
was
formed
of
the
bats
the
separation
of
the
bimana
and
quadrumana
was
retained
by
cuvier
and
most
of
the
subsequent
zoologists
it
seems
to
be
extremely
important
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
totally
wrong
this
was
first
shown
in
by
huxley
in
his
famous
place
in
on
the
strength
of
careful
comparative
anatomical
research
he
proved
that
the
apes
are
just
as
truly
as
man
or
if
we
prefer
to
reverse
it
that
man
is
as
truly
as
the
ape
he
showed
convincingly
that
the
ideas
of
hand
and
foot
had
been
wrongly
defined
and
had
been
improperly
based
on
physiological
instead
of
morphological
grounds
the
circumstance
that
we
oppose
the
thumb
to
the
other
four
fingers
in
our
hand
and
so
can
grasp
things
seemed
to
be
a
special
distinction
of
the
hand
in
contrast
to
the
foot
in
which
the
corresponding
great
toe
can
not
be
opposed
in
this
way
to
the
others
but
the
apes
can
grasp
with
the
as
well
as
the
fore
and
so
were
regarded
as
quadrumanous
however
the
inability
to
grasp
that
we
find
in
the
foot
of
civilised
man
is
a
consequence
of
the
habit
of
clothing
it
with
tight
coverings
for
thousands
of
years
many
of
the
lower
races
of
men
especially
among
the
negroes
use
the
foot
very
freely
in
the
same
way
as
the
hand
as
a
result
of
early
habit
and
continued
practice
they
can
grasp
with
the
foot
in
climbing
trees
for
instance
just
as
well
as
with
the
hand
even
infants
of
our
own
race
can
grasp
very
strongly
with
the
great
toe
and
hold
a
spoon
with
it
as
firmly
as
with
the
hand
hence
the
physiological
distinction
between
hand
and
foot
can
neither
be
pressed
very
far
nor
has
it
a
scientific
basis
we
must
look
to
morphological
characters
the
cynocephalus
leucophaeus
from
brehm
fig
from
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
possible
to
draw
such
a
sharp
morphological
distinction
based
on
anatomic
the
fore
and
hind
extremity
in
the
formation
both
of
the
bony
skeleton
and
of
the
muscles
that
are
connected
with
the
hand
and
foot
before
and
behind
there
are
material
and
constant
differences
and
these
are
found
both
in
man
and
the
ape
for
instance
the
number
and
arrangement
of
the
smaller
bones
of
the
hand
and
foot
are
quite
different
there
are
similar
constant
differences
in
the
muscles
the
hind
extremity
always
has
three
muscles
a
short
flexor
muscle
a
short
extensor
muscle
and
a
long
that
are
not
found
in
the
fore
extremity
the
arrangement
of
the
muscles
also
is
different
before
and
behind
these
characteristic
differences
between
the
fore
and
hind
extremities
are
found
in
man
as
well
as
the
ape
there
can
be
no
doubt
therefore
that
the
foot
deserves
that
name
just
as
much
as
the
human
foot
does
and
that
all
true
apes
are
just
as
as
man
the
common
distinction
of
the
apes
as
is
altogether
wrong
morphologically
but
it
may
be
asked
whether
quite
apart
from
this
we
can
find
any
other
features
that
distinguish
man
more
sharply
from
the
ape
than
the
various
species
of
apes
are
distinguished
from
each
other
huxley
gave
so
complete
and
demonstrative
a
reply
to
this
question
that
the
opposition
still
raised
on
many
sides
is
absolutely
without
foundation
on
the
ground
of
careful
comparative
anatomical
research
huxley
proved
that
in
all
morphological
respects
the
differences
between
the
highest
and
lowest
apes
are
greater
than
the
corresponding
differences
between
the
highest
apes
and
man
he
thus
restored
order
of
the
primates
excluding
the
bats
and
divided
it
into
three
the
first
composed
of
the
the
second
of
the
true
apes
the
third
of
men
but
as
we
wish
to
proceed
quite
consistently
and
impartially
on
the
laws
of
systematic
logic
we
may
on
the
strength
of
own
law
go
a
good
deal
farther
in
this
division
we
are
justified
in
going
at
least
one
important
step
farther
and
assigning
man
his
natural
place
within
one
of
the
sections
of
the
order
of
apes
all
the
features
that
characterise
this
group
of
apes
are
found
in
man
and
not
found
in
the
other
apes
we
do
not
seem
to
be
justified
therefore
in
founding
for
man
a
special
order
distinct
from
the
apes
the
order
of
the
true
apes
or
the
long
been
divided
into
two
principal
groups
which
also
differ
in
their
geographical
distribution
one
group
or
western
apes
live
in
america
the
other
group
to
which
man
belongs
are
the
or
eastern
apes
they
are
found
in
asia
and
africa
and
were
formerly
in
europe
all
the
eastern
apes
agree
with
man
in
the
features
that
are
chiefly
used
in
zoological
classification
to
distinguish
between
the
two
simian
groups
especially
in
the
dentition
the
objection
might
be
raised
that
the
teeth
are
too
subordinate
an
organ
physiologically
for
us
to
lay
stress
on
them
in
so
important
a
question
but
there
is
a
good
reason
for
it
it
is
with
perfect
justice
that
zoologists
have
for
more
than
a
century
paid
particular
attention
to
the
teeth
in
the
systematic
division
and
arrangement
of
the
orders
of
mammals
the
number
form
and
arrangement
of
the
teeth
are
much
more
faithfully
inherited
in
the
various
orders
than
most
other
characters
hence
the
form
of
dentition
in
man
is
very
important
in
the
fully
developed
condition
we
have
teeth
of
these
eight
are
incisors
four
canine
and
twenty

the
eight
incisors
in
the
middle
of
the
jaws
have
certain
characteristic
differences
above
and
below
in
the
upper
jaw
the
inner
incisors
are
larger
than
the
outer
in
the
lower

the

are

smaller

to
these
at

side
of

which
is
larger
than

it
is
very
prominent

the

have

the

of
the
old

or
all
the
living
or
fossil
apes
of
asia

and

have
the

dentition

half
of
the
jaw
they
have
six
molars
above
and
below
on

side
or
teeth
altogether
this
characteristic
difference
between
the
eastern
and
western
apes
has
been
so
faithfully
inherited
that
it
is
very
instructive
for
us
it
is
true
that
there
seems
to
be
an
exception
in
the
case
of
a
small
family
of
south
american
apes
the
small
silky
apes
or
which
include
the
tamarin
and
the
have
only
five
molars
in
each
half
of
the
jaw
instead
of
six
and
so
seem
to
be
nearer
to
the
eastern
apes
but
it
is
found
on
closer
examination
that
they
have
three
premolars
like
all
the
western
apes
and
that
only
the
last
molar
has
been
lost
hence
the
apparent
exception
really
confirms
the
above
distinction
of
the
other
features
in
which
the
two
groups
of
apes
differ
the
structure
of
the
nose
is
particularly
instructive
and
conspicuous
all
the
eastern
apes
have
the
same
type
of
nose
as
comparatively
narrow
partition
between
the
two
halves
so
that
the
nostrils
run
downwards
in
some
of
them
the
nose
protrudes
as
far
as
in
man
and
has
the
same
characteristic
structure
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
curious
apes
which
have
a
long
nose
most
of
the
eastern
apes
have
it
is
true
rather
flat
noses
like
for
instance
the
monkey
fig
but
the
nasal
partition
is
thin
and
narrow
in
them
all
the
american
apes
have
a
different
type
of
nose
the
partition
is
very
broad
and
thick
at
the
bottom
and
the
wings
of
the
nostrils
are
not
developed
so
that
they
point
outwards
instead
of
downwards
this
difference
in
the
form
of
the
nose
is
so
constantly
inherited
in
both
groups
that
the
apes
of
the
new
world
are
called
and
those
of
the
old
world
the
bony
passage
of
the
ear
at
the
bottom
of
which
is
the
tympanum
is
short
and
wide
in
all
the
platyrrhines
but
long
and
narrow
in
all
the
catarrhines
and
in
man
this
difference
also
is
significant
this
division
of
the
apes
into
platyrrhines
and
catarrhines
on
the
ground
of
the
above
hereditary
features
is
now
generally
admitted
in
zoology
and
receives
strong
support
from
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
two
groups
in
the
east
and
west
it
follows
at
once
as
regards
the
phylogeny
of
the
apes
that
two
divergent
lines
proceeded
from
the
common
of
the
in
the
early
tertiary
period
one
of
which
spread
over
the
old
the
other
over
the
new
world
it
is
certain
that
all
the
platyrrhines
come
of
one
stock
and
also
all
the
catarrhines
but
the
former
are
phylogenetically
older
and
must
be
regarded
as
the
of
the
latter
what
can
we
deduce
from
this
with
regard
to
our
own
genealogy
man
has
just
the
same
characters
the
same
form
of
dentition
auditory
passage
and
nose
as
all
the
catarrhines
in
this
he
radically
differs
from
the
platyrrhines
we
are
thus
forced
to
assign
him
a
position
among
the
eastern
apes
in
the
order
of
primates
or
at
least
place
him
alongside
of
them
but
it
follows
that
man
is
a
direct
blood
relative
of
the
apes
of
the
old
world
and
can
be
traced
to
a
common
together
with
all
the
catarrhines
in
his
whole
organisation
and
in
his
origin
man
is
a
true
catarrhine
he
originated
in
the
old
world
from
an
unknown
extinct
group
of
the
eastern
apes
the
apes
of
the
new
world
or
the
platyrrhines
form
a
divergent
branch
of
our
genealogical
tree
and
this
is
only
distantly
related
at
its
root
to
the
human
race
we
must
assume
of
course
that
the
earliest
eocene
apes
had
the
full
dentition
of
the
platyrrhines
hence
we
may
regard
this
as
a
special
stage
the
in
our
ancestry
and
deduce
from
it
as
the
stage
the
earliest
catarrhines
we
have
now
reduced
the
circle
of
our
nearest
relatives
to
the
small
and
comparatively
scanty
group
that
is
represented
by
the
of
the
catarrhines
and
we
are
in
a
position
to
answer
the
question
of
place
in
this
and
say
whether
we
can
deduce
anything
further
from
this
position
as
to
our
immediate
ancestors
in
answering
this
question
the
comprehensive
and
able
studies
that
huxley
gives
of
the
comparative
anatomy
of
man
and
the
various
catarrhines
in
his
place
in
are
of
great
assistance
to
us
it
is
quite
clear
from
these
that
the
differences
between
man
and
the
highest
catarrhines
gorilla
chimpanzee
and
orang
are
in
every
respect
slighter
than
the
corresponding
differences
between
the
highest
and
the
lowest
catarrhines
monkey
macaco
baboon
in
fact
within
the
small
group
of
the
anthropoid
apes
the
differences
between
the
various
genera
are
not
less
than
the
differences
between
them
and
man
this
is
seen
by
a
glance
at
the
skeletons
that
huxley
has
put
together
figs
whether
we
take
the
skull
or
the
vertebral
column
or
the
ribs
or
the
fore
or
hind
limbs
or
whether
we
extend
the
comparison
to
the
muscles
brain
placenta
we
always
reach
the
same
result
on
impartial
man
is
not
more
different
from
the
other
catarrhines
than
the
extreme
forms
of
them
for
instance
the
gorilla
and
baboon
differ
from
each
other
we
may
now
therefore
complete
the
huxleian
law
we
have
already
quoted
with
the
following
thesis
system
of
organs
we
take
a
comparison
of
their
modifications
in
the
series
of
catarrhines
always
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
the
anatomic
differences
that
separate
man
from
the
most
advanced
catarrhines
orang
gorilla
chimpanzee
are
not
as
great
as
those
that
separate
the
latter
from
the
lowest
catarrhines
monkey
macaco
baboon
we
must
therefore
consider
the
descent
of
man
from
other
catarrhines
to
be
fully
proved
whatever
further
information
on
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
living
catarrhines
we
may
obtain
in
the
future
it
can
not
possibly
disturb
this
conclusion
naturally
our
catarrhine
ancestors
must
have
passed
through
a
long
series
of
different
forms
before
the
human
type
was
produced
the
chief
advances
that
effected
this
of
man
or
his
differentiation
from
the
nearest
related
catarrhines
were
the
adoption
of
the
erect
posture
and
the
consequent
greater
differentiation
of
the
fore
and
hind
limbs
the
evolution
of
articulate
speech
and
its
organ
the
larynx
and
the
further
development
of
the
brain
and
its
function
the
soul
sexual
selection
had
a
great
influence
in
this
as
darwin
showed
in
his
famous
work
with
an
eye
to
these
advances
we
can
distinguish
at
least
four
important
stages
in
our
simian
ancestry
which
represent
prominent
points
in
the
historical
process
of
the
making
of
man
we
may
take
after
the
lemurs
the
earliest
and
lowest
platyrrhines
of
south
america
with
teeth
as
the
stage
of
our
genealogy
they
were
developed
from
the
lemurs
by
a
peculiar
modification
of
the
brain
teeth
nose
and
fingers
from
these
eocene
were
formed
the
earliest
catarrhines
or
eastern
apes
with
the
human
dentition
teeth
by
modification
of
the
nose
lengthening
of
the
bony
channel
of
the
ear
and
the
loss
of
four
these
oldest
of
the
whole
catarrhine
group
were
still
thickly
coated
with
hair
and
had
long
or
tailed
apes
fig
they
lived
during
the
tertiary
period
and
are
found
fossilised
in
the
miocene
of
the
actual
tailed
apes
perhaps
the
nearest
to
them
are
the
if
we
take
these
semnopitheci
as
the
stage
in
our
ancestry
we
may
put
next
to
them
as
the
the
anthropoid
apes
this
name
is
given
to
the
most
advanced
and
of
the
existing
catarrhines
they
were
developed
from
the
other
catarrhines
by
losing
the
tail
and
part
of
the
hair
and
by
a
higher
development
of
the
brain
which
found
expression
in
the
enormous
growth
of
the
skull
of
this
remarkable
family
there
are
only
a
few
genera
and
we
have
already
dealt

them

the
great
interest
that
every
thoughtful
man
takes
in
these
nearest
relatives
of
ours
has
found
expression
recently
in
a
fairly
large
literature

distinguished

impartial
treatment
of
the
question
of
affinity

professor
klaatsch
of
heidelberg
has
advanced
a
different
view
in
his
interesting
and
richly
illustrated
work
on
origin
and
development
of
the
this
is
a
substantial
supplement
to
my
in
so
far
as
it
gives
the
chief
results
of
modern
research
on
the
early
history
of
man
and
civilisation
but
when
klaatsch
declares
the
descent
of
man
from
the
apes
to
be
and
false
in
the
belief
that
we
are
thinking
of
some
living
species
of
ape
we
must
remind
him
that
no
competent
scientist
has
ever
held
so
narrow
a
view
all
of
us
look
the
sense
of
lamarck
and
the
original
unity
admitted
by
klaatsch
of
the
primate
stem
this
common
descent
of
all
the
primates
men
apes
and
lemurs
from
one
primitive
from
which
the
most
conclusions
follow
for
the
whole
of
anthropology
and
philosophy
is
admitted
by
klaatsch
as
well
as
by
myself
and
all
other
competent
zoologists
who
accept
the
theory
of
evolution
in
general
he
says
explicitly
three
anthropoid
chimpanzee
and
to
be
branches
from
a
common
root
and
this
was
not
far
from
that
of
the
gibbon
and
that
is
in
the
main
the
opinion
that
i
have
maintained
especially
against
virchow
in
a
number
of
works
ever
since
the
hypothetical
common
ancestor
of
all
the
primates
which
must
have
lived
in
the
earliest
tertiary
period
more
probably
in
the
cretaceous

calls

dubois
has
proposed
the
appropriate
name
of
for
the
common
and
much
younger
of
the
anthropomorpha
man
and
the
anthropoid
apes
the
actual
is
nearer
to
it
than
the
other
three
existing
anthropoids
none
of
these
can
be
said
to
be

none

lacked

human
characteristics

that
goes
with
it

so
had
a
less

the

of
the
organisation
of
this

i
then
advanced
was
brilliantly
confirmed

to
the

especially
as
i
can
not
go
any
further
here
into
these
anthropological
and
questions
i
will
only
repeat
that
i
think
he
is
wrong
in
the
attitude
of
hostility
that
he
affects
to
take
up
with
regard
to
my
own
views
on
the
descent
of
man
from
the
apes
the
most
powerful
opponent
of
the
pithecoid
the
theory
of
evolution
in
the
last
thirty
years
until
his
death
in
september
was
the
famous
berlin
anatomist
rudolf
virchow
in
the
speeches
which
he
delivered
every
year
at
various
congresses
and
meetings
on
this
question
he
was
never
tired
of
attacking
the
hated
his
constant
categorical
position
was
is
quite
certain
that
man
does
not
descend
from
the
ape
or
any
other
this
has
been
repeated
incessantly
by
opponents
of
the
theory
especially
theologians
and
philosophers
in
the
inaugural
speech
that
he
delivered
in
at
the
anthropological
congress
at
vienna
he
said
that
might
just
as
well
have
descended
from
a
sheep
or
an
elephant
as
from
an
absurd
expressions
like
this
only
show
that
the
famous
pathological
anatomist
who
did
so
much
for
medicine
in
the
establishment
of
cellular
pathology
had
not
the
requisite
attainments
in
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
systematic
zoology
and
paleontology
for
sound
judgment
in
the
province
of
anthropology
the
strassburg
anatomist
gustav
schwalbe
deserved
great
praise
for
having
the
moral
courage
to
oppose
this
dogmatic
and
ungrounded
teaching
of
virchow
and
showing
its
untenability
the
recent
admirable
works
of
schwalbe
on
the
pithecanthropus
the
earliest
races
of
men
and
the
neanderthal
skull
will
supply
any
candid
and
judicious
reader
with
the
empirical
material
with
which
he
can
convince
himself
of
the
baselessness
of
the
erroneous
dogmas
of
virchow
and
his
clerical
friends
ranke
bumüller
as
the
pithecanthropus
walked
erect
and
his
brain
judging
from
the
capacity
of
his
skull
fig
was
midway
between
the
lowest
men
and
the
anthropoid
apes
we
must
assume
that
the
next
great
step
in
the
advance
from
the
pithecanthropus
to
man
was
the
further
development
of
human
speech
and
reason
comparative
philology
has
recently
shown
that
human
speech
is
polyphyletic
in
origin
that
we
must
distinguish
several
probably
many
different
primitive
tongues
that
were
developed
independently
the
evolution
of
language
also
teaches
us
both
from
its
ontogeny
in
the
child
and
its
phylogeny
in
the
race
that
human
speech
proper
was
only
gradually
developed
after
the
rest
of
the
body
had
attained

of
our
first

the
protists
ancestors
are
unicellular

originally
unnucleated

then
plasmophagous
like
the

the
blastæads
ancestors
are
round
cœnobia
or
colonies
of
protozoa
they
consist
of
a
close
association
of
many
homogeneous
cells
and
thus
are
individuals
of
the
second
order
they
resemble
the
round
of
the
magospheræ

volvocina
equivalent
to
the
ontogenetic

evolution
of
the
nervous
system
the
previous
chapters
have
taught
us
how
the
human
body
as
a
whole
develops
from
the
first
simple
rudiment
a
single
layer
of
cells
the
whole
human
race
owes
its
origin
like
the
individual
man
to
a
simple
cell
the
unicellular
of
the
race
is
reproduced
daily
in
the
unicellular
embryonic
stage
of
the
individual
we
have
now
to
consider
in
detail
the
evolution
of
the
various
parts
that
make
up
the
human
frame
i
must
naturally
confine
myself
to
the
most
general
and
principal
outlines
to
make
a
special
study
of
the
evolution
of
each
organ
and
tissue
is
both
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
and
probably
beyond
the
anatomic
capacity
of
most
of
my
readers
to
appreciate
in
tracing
the
evolution
of
the
various
organs
we
shall
follow
the
method
that
has
hitherto
guided
us
except
that
we
shall
now
have
to
consider
the
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
of
the
organs
together
we
have
seen
in
studying
the
evolution
of
the
body
as
a
whole
that
phylogeny
casts
a
light
over
the
darker
paths
of
ontogeny
and
that
we
should
be
almost
unable
to
find
our
way
in
it
without
the
aid
of
the
former
we
shall
have
the
same
experience
in
the
study
of
the
organs
in
detail
and
i
shall
be
compelled
to
give
simultaneously
their
ontogenetic
and
phylogenetic
origin
the
more
we
go
into
the
details
of
organic
development
and
the
more
closely
we
follow
the
rise
of
the
various
parts
the
more
we
see
the
inseparable
connection
of
embryology
and
the
ontogeny
of
the
organs
can
only
be
understood
in
the
light
of
their
phylogeny
just
as
we
found
of
the
embryology
of
the
whole
body
each
embryonic
form
is
determined
by
a
corresponding
this
is
true
of
details
as
well
as
of
the
whole
we
will
consider
first
the
animal
and
then
the
vegetal
systems
of
organs
of
the
body
the
first
group
consists
of
the
psychic
and
the
motor
apparatus
to
the
former
belong
the
skin
the
nervous
system
and
the
the
motor
apparatus
is
composed
of
the
passive
and
the
active
organs
of
movement
the
skeleton
and
the
muscles
the
second
or
vegetal
group
consists
of
the
nutritive
and
the
reproductive
apparatus
to
the
nutritive
apparatus
belong
the
alimentary
canal
with
all
its
appendages
the
vascular
system
and
the
renal
kidney
system
the
reproductive
apparatus
comprises
the
different
organs
of
sex
embryonic
glands
sexual
ducts
and
copulative
organs
as
we
know
from
previous
chapters
the
animal
systems
of
organs
the
organs
of
sensation
and
presentation
develop
for
the
most
part
out
of
the
primary
or
the
cutaneous
skin
layer
on
the
other
hand
the
vegetal
systems
of
organs
arise
for
the
most
part
from
the
primary
the
visceral
layer
it
is
true
that
this
antithesis
of
the
animal
and
vegetal
spheres
of
the
body
in
man
and
all
the
higher
animals
is
by
no
means
rigid
several
parts
of
the
animal
apparatus
for
instance
the
greater
part
of
the
muscles
are
formed
from
cells
that
come
originally
from
the
entoderm
and
a
great
part
of
the
vegetative
apparatus
for
instance
the
and
the
gonoducts
are
composed
of
cells
that
come
from
the
ectoderm
in
the
more
advanced
animal
body
there
is
so
much
interlacing
and
displacement
of
the
various
parts
that
it
is
often
very
difficult
to
indicate
the
sources
of
them
but
broadly
speaking
we
may
take
it
as
a
positive
and
important
fact
that
in
man
and
the
higher
animals
the
chief
part
of
the
animal
organs
comes
from
the
ectoderm
and
the
greater
part
of
the
vegetative
organs
from
the
entoderm
it
was
for
this
reason
that
carl
ernst
von
baer
called
the
one
the
animal
and
the
other
the
vegetative
layer
see
the
solid
foundation
of
this
important
thesis
is
the
the
most
instructive
embryonic
form
in
the
animal
world
which
we
still
find
in
the
same
shape
in
the
most
diverse
classes
of
animals
this
form
points
demonstrably
to
a
common
of
all
the
metazoa
the
in
this
the
whole
body
consisted
throughout
life
of
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
as
is
now
the
case
temporarily
in
the
gastrula
in
the
gastræa
the
simple
cutaneous
skin
layer
represented
all
the
animal
organs
and
functions
and
the
simple
visceral
gut
layer
all
the
vegetal
organs
and
functions
this
is
the
case
with
the
modern
gastræads
fig
and
it
is
also
the
case
potentially
with
the
gastrula
we
shall
easily
see
that
the
gastræa
theory
is
thus
able
to
throw
a
good
deal
of
light
both
morphologically
and
physiologically
on
some
of
the
chief
features
of
embryonic
development
if
we
take
up
first
the
consideration
of
the
chief
element
in
the
animal
sphere
the
psychic
apparatus
or
sensorium
and
its
evolution
this
apparatus
consists
of
two
very
different
parts
which
seem
at
first
to
have
very
little
connection
with
each
outer
skin
with
all
its
hairs
nails
and
the
nervous
system
the
latter
comprises
the
central
nervous
system
brain
and
spinal
cord
the
peripheral
cerebral
and
spinal
nerves
and
the
in
the
vertebrate
body
these
two
chief
elements
of
the
sensorium
lie
far
apart
the
skin
being
external
to
and
the
central
nervous
system
in
the
very
centre
of
the
body
the
one
is
only
connected
with
the
other
by
a
section
of
the
peripheral
nervous
system
and
the
nevertheless
as
we
know
from
human
embryology
the
medullary
tube
is
formed
from
the
cutaneous
layer
the
organs
that
discharge
the
most
advanced
functions
of
the
animal
organs
of
the
soul
or
of
psychic
from
the
external
skin
this
is
a
perfectly
natural
and
necessary
process
if
we
reflect
on
the
historical
evolution
of
the
psychic
and
sensory
functions
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
cells
which
accomplish
them
must
originally
have
been
located
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
body
only
elementary
organs
in
this
superficial
position
could
directly
receive
the
influences
of
the
environment
afterwards
under
the
influence
of
natural
selection
the
cellular
group
in
the
skin
which
was
specifically
withdrew
into
the
inner
and
more
protected
part
of
the
body
and
formed
there
the
foundation
of
a
central
nervous
organ
as
a
result
of
increased
differentiation
the
skin
and
the
central
nervous
system
became
further
and
further
separated
and
in
the
end
the
two
were
only
permanently
connected

the
afferent
peripheral
sensory
nerves

secrete

they

these

nothing
more

structure
of
this
large
and
elaborate
gland
is
a
very
simple
cone
in
the
epidermis

penetrates
into
the
corium

ramifies

of
twelve

eighteen
radiating

these

ramify
their

is
formed
the
prominent

rises
the
teat

the
latter
is
only
developed
later
on
when
the
mammary
gland
is
and
this
ontogenetic
phenomenon
is
extremely
interesting
because
the
earlier
mammals
the
of
the
whole
class
have
no
teats
in
them
the
milk
comes
out
through
a
flat
portion
of

is
pierced

a
sieve
as
we
still
find
in

the

we
find
two
successive

even
more

have
four

their

we
must
regard
them
as
highly
characteristic
of

it
is
true
that
we
also
find
hairs
in
many
of
the
lower
animals
such
as
insects

worms
but
these
hairs
like
the
hairs
of
plants
are
appendages
of
the
surface
and
differ
entirely
from
the
hairs
of
the
mammals
in
the
details
of
their
structure
and
development
the
embryology
of
the
hairs
is
known
in
all
its
details
but
there
are
two
different
views
as
to
their
phylogeny
on
the
older
view
the
hairs
of
the
mammals
are
equivalent
or
homologous
to
the
feathers
of
the
bird
or
the
horny
scales
of
the
reptile
as
we
deduce
all
three
classes
of
amniotes
from
a
common
we
must
assume
that
these
permian
had
a
complete
scaly
coat
inherited
from
their
carboniferous
ancestors
the
mailed
amphibia
the
bony
scales
of
their
corium
were
covered
with
horny
scales
in
passing
from
aquatic
to
terrestrial
life
the
horny
scales
were
further
developed
and
the
bony
scales
degenerated
in
most
of
the
reptiles
as
regards
the
feathers
it
is
certain
that
they
are
modifications
of
the
horny
scales
of
their
reptilian
ancestors
but
it
is
otherwise
with
the
hairs
of
the
mammals
in
their
case
the
hypothesis
has
lately
been
advanced
on
the
strength
of
very
extensive
research
especially
by
friedrich
maurer
that
they
have
been
evolved
from
the
cutaneous
of
amphibian
ancestors
by
modification
of
functions
the
epidermic
structure
is
very
similar
in
both
in
its
embryonic
rudiments
this
modern
view
which
had
the
support
of
the
greatest
expert
on
the
vertebrates
carl
gegenbaur
can
be
harmonised
with
the
older
theory
to
an
extent
in
the
sense
that
both
formations
scales
and
hairs
were
very
closely
connected
originally
probably
the
conical
budding
of
the
layer
grew
up
the
protection
of
the
horny
scale
and
became
an
organ
of
touch
subsequently
by
the
cornification
of
the
hairs

hairs
are
still
sensory
organs

as
a
rule

astonished
to
find

on
the
shoulders

extremities
of
members
of

and
of
the
semitic
races
exceptional
hair
on

as
on
the
whole

hereditary
in
certain
families
of

the
quantity
and
the
quality
of
the

on

are
also
conspicuously
transmitted
in
families
these
extraordinary
variations
in
the
total
and
partial
hairy
coat
of
the
body
which
are
so
noticeable
not
only
in
comparing
different
races
of
men
but
also
in
comparing
different
families
of
the
same
race
can
only
be
explained
on
the
assumption
that
in
man
the
hairy
coat
is
on
the
whole
a
rudimentary
organ
a
useless
inheritance
from
the
more
apes
in
this
man
resembles
the
elephant
rhinoceros
hippopotamus
whale
and
other
mammals
of
various
orders
which
have
also
almost
entirely
or
for
the
most
part
lost
their
hairy
coats
by
adaptation
the
particular
process
of
adaptation
by
which
man
lost
the
growth
of
hair
on
most
parts
of
his
body
and
retained
or
augmented
it
at
some
points
was
most
probably
sexual
selection
as
darwin
luminously
showed
in
his
of
man
sexual
selection
has
been
very
active
in
this
respect
as
the
male
anthropoid
apes
chose
the
females
with
the
least
hair
and
the
females
favoured
the
males
with
the
finest
growths
on
chin
and
head
the
general
coating
of
the
body
gradually
degenerated
and
the
hair
of
the
beard
and
head
was
more
strongly
developed
the
growth
of
hair
at
other
parts
of
the
body
pubic
region
was
also
probably
due
to
sexual
selection
moreover
changes
of
climate
or
habits
and
other
adaptations
unknown
to

may
have
assisted
the
disappearance
of
the
hairy

of
a

fig
of
a

seen
from

side
from
the

the
fact
that
our
coat
of
hair
is
inherited
directly
from
the
anthropoid
apes
is
proved
in
an
interesting
way
according
to
darwin
by
the
direction
of
the
rudimentary
hairs
on
our
arms
which
can
not
be
explained
in
any
other
way
both
on
the
upper
and
the
lower
part
of
the
arm
they
point
towards
the
elbow
here
they
meet
at
an
obtuse
angle
this
curious
arrangement
is
found
only
in
the
anthropoid
chimpanzee
orang
and
several
species
of
man
figs
in
other
species
of
gibbon
the
hairs
are
pointed
towards
the
hand
both
in
the
upper
and
lower
arm
as
in
the
rest
of
the
mammals
we
can
easily
explain
this
remarkable
peculiarity
of
the
anthropoids
and
man
on
the
theory
that
our
common
ancestors
were
accustomed
as
the
anthropoid
apes
are
to
place
their
hands
over
their
heads
or
across
a
branch
above
their
heads
during
rain
in
this
position
the
fact
that
the
hairs
point
downwards
helps
the
rain
to
run
off
thus
the
direction
of
the
hair
on
the
lower
part
of
our
arm
reminds
us
of
that
useful
custom
of
our
anthropoid
ancestors
the
nervous
system
in
man
and
all
the
other
vertebrates
is
when
fully
formed
an
extremely
complex
apparatus
that
we
may
compare
in
anatomic
structure
and
physiological
function
with
an
extensive
telegraphic
system
the
chief
station
of
the
system
is

central

nervous
system

innumerable
ganglionic
cells
or
fig
of
which
are
connected
by
branching
processes

each
other

with

of
very
fine
conducting
wires
the
latter
are
the
peripheral
and
ubiquitous
with
their
terminal
apparatus
the
they
constitute

or

the

and
other

commands
of
the

to
the
muscles
the
central
nervous
system
or
central
marrow
is
the
real
organ
of
psychic
action
in
the
narrower
sense
however
we
conceive
the
intimate
connection
of
this
organ
and
its
functions
it
is
certain
that
its
characteristic
actions
which
we
call
sensation
will
and
thought
are
inseparably
dependent
on
the
normal
development
of
the
material
organ
in
man
and
all
the
higher
animals
we
must
therefore
pay
particular
attention
to
the
evolution
of
the
latter
as
it
can
give
us
most
important
information
regarding
the
nature
of
the
it
should
be
full
of
interest
if
the
central
marrow
develops
in
just
the
same
way
in
the
human
embryo

in
the
embryo

other

evolution
of
the
human
psychic
organ
from
the
central

us
that
in

the

is
at

composed
not
of

of

we
find
between
the

a
small
ganglion
composed
of
two
prominences
which
is
called
the
on
account
of
a
superficial
transverse
fissure
cutting
across

although
this
quadrigeminum
is
very
insignificant
in

the

it
forms
a
special
third

greatly
developed

the

the

is
the
quadrangular

a
narrow

called
aqueduct

passes
through
the
corpus

lies

is
connected
with

of

thus
all
the
cavities
of
the
central
marrow
are
directly
interconnected
all
these
parts
of
the
brain
have
an
infinitely
complex
structure
in
detail
but
we
can
not
go
into
this
although
it
is
much
more
elaborate
in
man
and
the
higher
vertebrates
than
in
the
lower
classes
it
develops
in
them
all
from
the
same
rudimentary
structure
the
five
simple
cerebral
vesicles
of
the
embryonic
brain
but
before
we
consider
the
development
of
the
complicated
structure
of
the
brain
from
this
simple
series
of
vesicles
let
us
glance
for
a
moment
at
the
lower
animals
which
have
no
brain
even
in
the
vertebrate
the
amphioxus
we
find
no
independent
brain
as
we
have
seen
the
whole
central
marrow
is
merely
a
simple
cylindrical
cord
which
runs
the
length
of
the
body
and
ends
equally
simply
at
both
plain
medullary
tube
all
that
we
can
discover
is
a
small
vesicular
bulb
at
the
foremost
part
of
the
tube
a
degenerate
rudiment
of
a
primitive
brain
we
meet
the
same
simple
medullary
tube
in
the
first
structure
of
the
ascidia
larva
in
the
same
characteristic
position
above
the
chorda
on
closer
examination
we
find
here
also
a
small
vesicular
swelling
at
the
fore
end
of
the
tube
the
first
trace
of
a
differentiation
of
it
into
brain
and
spinal
cord
it
is
probable
that
this
differentiation
was
more
advanced
in
the
extinct
provertebrates
and
the
more
pronounced
figs
the
brain
is
phylogenetically
older
than
the
spinal
cord
as
the
trunk
was
not
developed
until
after
the
head
if
we
consider
the
undeniable
affinity
of
the
ascidiæ
to
the
vermalia
and
remember
that
we
can
trace
all
the
chordonia
to
lower
vermalia
it
seems
probable
that
the
simple
central
marrow
of
the
former
is
equivalent
to
the
simple
nervous
ganglion
which
lies
above
the
gullet
in
the
lower
worms
and
has
long
been
known
as
the
pharyngeal
pharyngeum
it
would
be
better
to
call
it
the
primitive
or
vertical
brain
acroganglion
probably
this
upper
pharyngeal
ganglion
of
the
lower
worms
is
the
structure
from
which
the
complex
central
marrow
of
the
higher
animals
has
been
evolved
the
medullary
tube
of
the
chordonia
has
been
formed
by
the
lengthening
of
the
vertical
brain
on
the
dorsal
side
in
all
the
other
animals
the
central
nervous
system
has
been
developed
in
a
totally
different
way
from
the
upper
pharyngeal
ganglion
in
the
articulates
especially
a
pharyngeal
ring
with
ventral
marrow
has
been
added
the
molluscs
also
have
a
pharyngeal
ring
but
it
is
not
found
in
the
vertebrates
in
these
the
central
marrow
has
been
prolonged
down
the
dorsal
side
in
the
articulates
down
the
ventral
side
this
fact
proves
of
itself
that
there
is
no
direct
relationship
between
the
vertebrates
and
the
articulates
the
unfortunate
attempts
to
derive
the
dorsal
marrow
of
the
former
from
the
ventral
marrow
of
the
latter
have
totally
failed

when

we
must
start
from
the
important
fact
which
we
have
already
seen
that
the
first
structure
of
it
in
man
and
all
the
higher
vertebrates
is
the
simple
medullary
tube
and
that
this
separates
from
the
outer
germinal
layer
in
the
middle
line
of
the
embryonic
shield
as
the
reader
will
remember
the
straight
medullary
furrow

appears
in
the

of
the
embryonic
shield
at
each
side
of
it
the
parallel
borders
curve
over
in
the
form
of
dorsal
or
medullary
swellings
these
bend
together
with
their
free
borders
and
thus
form
the
closed
medullary
tube
figs
at
first
this
tube
lies
directly
underneath
the
horny
plate
but
it
afterwards
travels
inwards
the
upper
edges
of
the
provertebral
plates
growing
together
between
the
horny
plate
and
the
tube
joining
above
the
latter
and
forming
a
completely
closed
canal
as
gegenbaur
very
properly
observes
gradual
imbedding
in
the
inner
part
of
the

is
a
process
acquired
with
the
progressive
differentiation
and
the
higher
potentiality
that
this
secures
by
this
process
the
organ
of
greater
value
to
the
organism

buried
within

early
to
expand
into
a

this
is
the
first
outline
of
an
independent
brain
in
this
way
the
central
marrow
of
the
vertebrates
divides
clearly
into
its
two
chief
sections
brain
and
spinal
cord
the
simple
vesicular
form
of
the
brain
which
persists
for
some
time

also

in

it
soon
passes
away
the
one

divided

we
must
certainly
regard
it
as
a
and
ontogenetic
fact
of
the
greatest
significance
that
in
all
the
craniotes
from
the
lowest
cyclostomes

up
to
the
apes

man
the
brain
develops
in

always
a
simple
vesicular

three
then
five
vesicles
develop
from
this
bulb
and
the
permanent
brain
with
all
its
complex
anatomic
structures
of
so
great
a
variety
in
the
various
classes
of
vertebrates
is
formed
from
the
five
primitive
vesicles
when
we
compare
the
mature
brain
of
a
fish
an
amphibian
a
reptile
a
bird
and
a
mammal
it
seems
incredible
that
we
can
trace
the
various
parts
of
these
organs
that
differ
so
much
internally
and
externally
to
common
types
yet
all
these
different
craniote
brains
have
started
with
the
same
rudimentary
structure
to
convince
ourselves
of
this
we
have
only
to
compare
the
corresponding
stages
of
development
of
the
embryos
of
these
different
animals
this
comparison
is
extremely
instructive
if
we
extend
it
through
the
whole
series
of
the
craniotes
we
soon
discover
this
interesting
fact
in
the
cyclostomes
the
myxinoida
and
petromyzonta
which
we
have
recognised
as
the
lowest
and
earliest
craniotes
the
whole
brain
remains
throughout
life
at
a
very
low
stage
which
is
very
brief
and
passing
in
the
embryos
of
the
higher
craniotes
they
retain
the
five
original
sections
of
the
brain
unchanged
in
the
fishes
we
find
an
essential
and
considerable
modification
of
the
five
vesicles
it
is
clearly
the
brain
of
the
selachii
in
the
first
place
and
subsequently
the
brain
of
the
ganoids
from
which
the
brain
of
the
rest
of
the
fishes
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
dipneusts
and
amphibia
and
through
these
of
the
higher
vertebrates
on
the
other
hand
must
be
derived
in
the
fishes
and
amphibia
fig
there
is
a
preponderant
development
of
the
middle
brain
and
also
the
after
brain
the
first
second
and
fourth
sections
remaining
very
primitive
it
is
just
the
reverse
in
the
higher
vertebrates
in
which
the
first
and
third
sections
the
cerebrum
and
cerebellum
are
exceptionally
developed
while
the
middle

after
brain
remain
small
the
corpora
quadrigemina
are
mostly
covered
by
the
cerebrum
and
the

by
the

but
we
find
a
number
of
stages
of
development
within
the
higher
vertebrates
themselves
from
the
amphibia
upwards
the
brain
and
with
it
the
psychic
life
develops
in
two
different
directions
one
of
these
is
followed
by
the
reptiles

and
the
other
by
the

the
development
of
the

characteristic

are

position
of
the
cerebral

in

lower
craniotes
they
lie
originally
almost
in
the
same
plane
when
we
examine
the
brain
laterally
we
can
cut
through
all
five
vesicles
with
a
straight
line
but
in
the
amniotes
there
is
a
considerable
curve
in
the
brain
along
with
the
bending
of
the
head
and
neck
the
whole
of
the
upper
dorsal
surface
of
the
brain
develops
much
more
than
the
under
ventral
surface
this
causes
a
curve
so
that
the
parts
come
to
lie
as
follows
the
fore
brain
is
right
in
front
and
below
the
intermediate
brain
a
little
higher
and
the
middle

highest
of
all

brain
lies
a
little
lower
and
the
after
brain
lower
still
we
find
this
only
in
the
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
thus
while
the
brain
of
the
mammals
agrees
a
good
deal
in
general
growth
with
that
of
the
birds
and
reptiles
there
are
some
striking
differences
between
the
two
in
the
sauropsids
birds
and
reptiles
the
middle
brain
and
the
middle
part
of
the
hind
brain
are
well
developed
in
the
mammals
these
parts
do
not
grow
and
the
develops
so
much
that
it
overlies
the
other
vesicles
as
it
continues
to
grow
towards
the
rear
it
at
last
covers
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
brain
and
also
encloses
the
middle
parts
from
the
sides
figs
this
process
is
of
great
importance
because
the
fore
brain
is
the
organ
of
the
higher
psychic
life
and
in
it
those
functions
of
the
are
discharged
which
we
sum
up
in
the
word
the
highest
achievements
of
the
animal
wonderful
manifestations
of
consciousness
and
the
complex
molecular
processes
of
their
seat
in
the
fore
brain
we
can
remove
the
large
hemispheres
piece
by
piece
from
the
mammal
without
killing
it
and
we
then
see
how
the
higher
functions
of
consciousness
thought
will
and

the

an
astonishing

were
not

careful

has
discovered

that

important
information
in

the

questions
of
psychology
the

brain
and
spinal

develops
from
the
medullary
tube
in
man
just
as
in
all
the
other
mammals
and
the
same
applies
to
the
conducting
marrow
or
nervous
it
consists
of
the
nerves
which
conduct
centripetally
the
impressions
from
the
skin
and
the
to
the
central
marrow
and
of
the
nerves
which
convey
centrifugally
the
movements
of
the

from
the
central
marrow
to
the
muscles
all
these
peripheral
nerves
grow
out
of
the

fig
and
are
like
it
products
of
the
layer
the
complete
agreement
in
the
structure
and
development
of
the
psychic
organs
which
we
find
between
man
and
the
highest
mammals
and
which
can
only
be
explained
by
their
common
origin
is
of
profound
importance
in
the
monistic
psychology
this
is
only
seen
in
its
full
light
when
we
compare
these
morphological
facts
with
the
corresponding
physiological
phenomena
and
remember
that
every
psychic
action
requires
the
complete
and
normal
condition
of
the
correlative
brain
structure
for
its
full
and
normal
exercise
the
very
complex
molecular
movements
inside
the
neural
cells
which
we
describe
comprehensively
as
life
of
the
soul
can
no
more
exist
in
the
vertebrate
and
therefore
in
man
without
their
organs
than
the
circulation
without
the
heart
and
blood
and
as
the
central
marrow
develops
in
man
from
the
same
medullary
tube
as
that
of
the
other
vertebrates
and
as
man
shares
the
characteristic
structure
of
his
cerebrum
the
organ
of
thought
with
the
anthropoid
apes
his
psychic
life
also
must
have
the
same
origin
as
theirs
if
we
appreciate
the
full
weight
of
these
morphological
and
physiological
facts
and
put
a
proper
phylogenetic
interpretation
on
the
observations
of
embryology
we
see
that
the
older
idea
of
the
personal
immortality
of
the
human
soul
is
scientifically
untenable
death
puts
an
end
in
man
as
in
any
other
vertebrate

the
physiological
function
of
the
cerebral

countless
microscopic
ganglionic

indubitably
among
the
most
important
and
interesting
parts
of
the
human
body
they
are
the
organs
by
means
of
which
we
obtain
our
knowledge
of
objects
in
the
surrounding
world
est

in
they
are
the
first
sources
of
the
life
of
the
soul
there
is
no
other
part
of
the
body
in
which
we
discover
such
elaborate
anatomical
structures
with
a
definite
purpose
and
there
is
no
other
organ
in
which
the
wonderful
and
purposive
structure
seems
so
clearly
to
compel
us
to
admit
a
creator
and
a
preconceived
plan
hence
we
find
special
efforts
made
by
dualists
to
draw
our
attention
here
to
the
of
the
and
the
design
visible
in
his
works
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
will
discover
on
mature
reflection
that
on
this
theory
the
creator
is
at
bottom
only
playing
the
part
of
a
clever
mechanic
or
all
these
familiar
teleological
ideas
of
creator
and
creation
are
based
in
the
long
run
on
a
similar
childlike
anthropomorphism
however
we
must
grant
that
at
the
first
glance
the
teleological
theory
seems
to
give
the
simplest
and
most
satisfactory
explanation
of
these
purposive
structures
if
we
merely
examine
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
most
advanced
it
seems
impossible
to
explain
them
without
postulating
a
creative
act
yet
evolution
shows
us
quite
clearly
that
this
popular
idea
is
totally
wrong
with
its
assistance
we
discover
that
the
purposive
and
remarkable
were
developed
like
all
other
organs
without
any
preconceived
by
the
same
mechanical
process
of
natural
selection
the
same
constant
correlation
of
adaptation
and
heredity
by
which
the
other
purposive
structures
in
the
animal
frame
were
slowly
and
gradually
brought
forth
in
the
struggle
for
life
like
most
other
vertebrates
man
has
six
sensory
organs
which
serve
for
eight
different
classes
of
sensations
the
skin
serves
for
sensations
of
pressure
and
temperature
this
is
the
oldest
lowest
and
vaguest
of
the
it
is
distributed
over
the
surface
of
the
body
the
other
sensory
activities
are
localised
the
sexual
sense
is
bound
up
with
the
skin
of
the
external
sexual
organs
the
sense
of
taste
with
the
mucous
lining
of
the
mouth
tongue
and
palate
and
the
sense
of
smell
with
the
mucous
lining
of
the
nasal
cavity
for
the
two
most
advanced
and
most
highly
differentiated
sensory
functions
there
are
special
and
very
elaborate
mechanical
eye
for
the
sense
of
sight
and
the
ear
for
the
sense
of
hearing
and
space
equilibrium
comparative
anatomy
and
physiology
teach
us
that
there
are
no
differentiated
in
the
lower
animals
all
their
sensations
are
received
by
the
surface
of
the
skin
the
undifferentiated
or
ectoderm
of
the
gastræa
is
the
simple
stratum
of
cells
from
which
the
differentiated
of
all
the
metazoa
including
the
vertebrates
have
been
evolved
starting
from
the
assumption
that
necessarily
only
the
superficial
parts
of
the
body
which
are
in
direct
touch
with
the
outer
world
could
be
concerned
in
the
origin
of
sensations
we
can
see
at
once
that
the
also
must
have
arisen
there
this
is
really
the
case
the
chief
part
of
all
the
originates
from
the
layer
partly
directly
from
the
horny
plate
partly
from
the
brain
the
foremost
part
of
the
medullary
tube
after
it
has
separated
from
the
horny
plate
if
we
compare
the
embryonic
development
of
the
various
we
see
that
they
all
make
their
appearance
in
the
simplest
conceivable
form
the
wonderful
contrivances
that
make
the
higher
among
the
most
remarkable
and
elaborate
structures
in
the
body
develop
only
gradually
in
the
phylogenetic
explanation
of
them
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
achieve
their
greatest
triumphs
but
at
first
all
the
are
merely
parts
of
the
skin
in
which
sensory
nerves
expand
these
nerves
themselves
were
originally
of
a
homogeneous
character
the
different
functions
or
specific
energies
of
the
differentiated
were
only
gradually
developed
by
division
of
labour
at
the
same
time
their
simple
terminal
expansions
in
the
skin
were
converted
into
extremely
complex
organs
the
great
instructiveness
of
these
historical
facts
in
connection
with
the
life
of
the
soul
is
not
difficult
to
see
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
future
will
be
transformed
as
soon
as
psychology
takes
cognisance
of
these
genetic
phenomena
and
makes
them
the
basis
of
its
speculations
when
we
examine
impartially
the
manuals
of
psychology
that
have
been
published
by
the
most
distinguished
speculative
philosophers
and
are
still
widely
distributed
we
are
astonished
at
the
naivete
with
which
the
authors
raise
their
airy
metaphysical
speculations
regardless
of
the
momentous
embryological
facts
that
completely
refute
them
yet
the
science
of
evolution
in
conjunction
with
the
great
advance
of
the
comparative
anatomy
and
physiology
of

in

the

those
organs
the

which
spread

simply

of
the
skin

of

in
the
second
group
the
nerves

mucous

cavities
which
are
at
first
depressions
in
or
invaginations
of
the
skin
organs
of
the
sense
of

the
third
group
is
formed
of
the
very
elaborate
organs
the
nerves
of
which
spread
out
in
an
internal
vesicle
separated
from
the
skin
organs
of
the
sense
of
sight
hearing
and
space
there
is
little
to
be
said
of
the
development
of
the
lower
we
have
already
considered
the
organ
of
touch

temperature
in
the
skin
i
need
only
add
that

the
precise

of
these

organs
of

kind

terminate

find
similar
corpuscles
in

organs
of

sexual
sense
the
male
penis
and

female

they
are
processes
of

the

ends
originates
from
a
part
of
the
outer
skin
as
we
have
seen
the
whole
of
the
is
formed
not
as
a
part
of
the
proper
but
as
a
fold
in
the
outer
skin
its
mucous
lining
is
therefore
formed
not
from
the
visceral
but
from
the
cutaneous

and
the

of

the

is
much
more
interesting
although
the

seems
superficially
to
be

really

all

gnathostomes
of

completely
separated

so

the

into

they
open

so
that

all
the
different

the
advanced

has
passed
through

various
periods

the
course
of
its
phylogeny
it

appears
in

the
higher
vertebrates
in

the
double
persists
throughout

at
an
early
stage
before
there
is
any
trace
of
the
characteristic
human
face
a

of
small
pits
are
formed

first
discovered
by
baer
and
rightly
called

also
originates

the

of

presently
abolished

forming

its
outer

a
parallel
ridge
is
formed
on
either
side
between

and

these
are
the
outer
nasal

thus
between
the
inner

outer
nasal
processes
a
depression
is
formed
on
either
side
which
leads
from
the
nasal
pit
towards
the
this
groove
is
as
the
reader
will
guess
the

nasal
furrow

we
have
already
seen

as
the
parallel
edges
of
the
inner

bend
towards

this

converted

the
primitive
nasal
canal
hence
the
nose
of
man

all
the
other
amniotes
consists
at
this
embryonic
stage
of
a
couple
of
narrow
tubes
the
nasal
canals
which
lead
from
the
outer

of
the

this
transitory
condition
resembles
that
in

we
find
the
nose
permanently
in

amphibia
a
structure
which
grows
from
below
towards
the
lower
ends
of
the
two
nasal
processes

joins
with
them
plays
an
important
part
in

conversion

nasal

closed

is
the
process

may
call

this
is
done
in
just
the

the

in

they

its

in

is
no

to
be

formed

this
organ
is
only
found
in
the
mammalian
class
it
is
very
rudimentary
in
the
lowest
section
the
monotremes
in
the
others
it
is
found
at
very
different
stages
of
development
and
sometimes
of
degeneration
it
is
degenerate
in
most
of
the
aquatic
mammals
the
majority
of
them
have
lost
it
instance
the
walruses
and
whales
and
most
of
the
seals
on
the
other
hand
the
pinna
is
well
developed
in
the
great
majority
of
the
marsupials
and
placentals
it
receives
and
collects
the
waves
of
sound
and
is
equipped
with
a
very
elaborate
muscular
apparatus
by
means
of
which
the
pinna
can
be
turned
freely
in
any
direction
and
its
shape
be
altered
it
is
well
known
how
readily
domestic
cows
dogs
hares
their
ears
and
move
them
in
different
directions
most
of
the
apes
do
the
same
and
our
earlier
ape
ancestors
were
also
able
to
do
it
but
our
later
simian
ancestors
which
we
have
in
common
with
the
anthropoid
apes
abandoned
the
use
of
these
muscles
and
they
gradually
became
rudimentary
and
useless
however
we
possess
them
still
fig
in
fact
some
men
can
still
move
their
ears
a
little
backward
and
forward
by
means
of
the
drawing
and
withdrawing
muscles
and
with
practice
this
faculty
can
be
much
improved
but
no
man
can
now
lift
up
his
ears
by
the
raising
muscle
or
change
the
shape
of
them
by
the
small
inner
muscles
e
f
these
muscles
were
very
useful
to
our
ancestors
but
are
of
no
consequence
to
us
this
applies
to
most
of
the
anthropoid
apes
as
well
we
also
share
with
the
higher
anthropoid
apes
gorilla
chimpanzee
and
orang
the
characteristic
form
of
the
human
outer
ear
especially
the
folded
border
the
helix
and
the
lobe
the
lower
apes
have
pointed
ears
without
folded
border
or
lobe
like
the
other
mammals
but
darwin
has
shown
that
at
the
upper
part
of
the
folded
border
there
is
in
many
men
a
small
pointed
process
which
most
of
us
do
not
possess
in
some
individuals
this
process
is
well
developed
it
can
only
be
explained
as
the
relic
of
the
original
point
of
the
ear
which
has
been
turned
inwards
in
consequence
of
the
curving
of
the
edge
if
we
compare
the
pinna
of
man
and
the
various
apes
in
this
respect
we
find
that
they
present
a
connected
series
of
degenerate
structures
in
the
common
catarrhine
ancestors
of
the
anthropoids
and
man
the
degeneration
set
in
with
the
folding
together
of
the
pinna
this
brought
about
the
helix
of
the
ear
in
which
we
find
the
significant
angle
which
represents
the
relic
of
the
salient
point
of
the
ear
in
our
earlier
simian
ancestors
here
again
therefore
comparative
anatomy
enables
us
to
trace
with
certainty
the
human
ear
to
the
similar
but
more
developed
organ
of
the
lower
mammals
at
the
same
time
comparative
physiology
shows
that
it
was
a
more
or
less
useful
implement
in
the
latter
but
it
is
quite
useless
in
the
anthropoids
and
man
the
conducting
of
the
sound
has
scarcely
been
affected
by
the
loss
of
the
pinna
we
have
also
in
this
the
explanation
of
the
extraordinary
variety
in
the
shape
and
size
of
the
shell
of
the
ear
in
different
men
in
this
it
resembles

evolution
of
the
organs
of
movement
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
locomotive
apparatus
is
one
of
the
features
that
are
most
distinctive
of
the
vertebrate
stem
the
chief
part
of
this
apparatus
is
formed
as
in
all
the
higher
animals
by
the
active
organs
of
movement
the
muscles
in
consequence
of
their
contractility
they
have
the
power
to
draw
up
and
shorten
themselves
this
effects
the
movement
of
the
various
parts
of
the
body
and
thus
the
whole
body
is
conveyed
from
place
to
place
but
the
arrangement
of
these
muscles
and
their
relation
to
the
solid
skeleton
are
different
in
the
vertebrates
from
the
invertebrates
in
most
of
the
lower
animals
especially
the
platodes
and
vermalia
we
find
that
the
muscles
form
a
simple
thin
layer
of
flesh
immediately
underneath
the
skin
this
muscular
layer
is
very
closely
connected
with
the
skin
itself
it
is
the
same
in
the
mollusc
stem
even
in
the
large
division
of
the
articulates
the
classes
of
crabs
spiders
myriapods
and
insects
we
find
a
similar
feature
with
the
difference
that
in
this
case
the
skin
forms
a
solid
rigid
cutaneous
skeleton
made
of
chitine
and
often
also
of
carbonate
of
lime
this
external
chitine
coat
undergoes
a
very
elaborate
articulation
both
on
the
trunk
and
the
limbs
of
the
articulates
and
in
consequence
the
muscular
system
also
the
contractile
fibres
of
which
are
attached
inside
the
chitine
tubes
is
highly
articulated
the
vertebrates
form
a
direct
contrast
to
this
in
these
alone
a
solid
internal
skeleton
is
developed
of
cartilage
or
bone
to
which
the
muscles
are
attached
this
bony
skeleton
is
a
complex
lever
apparatus
or
apparatus

its
rigid
parts
the
arms
of
the

the

are

by

admirable
locomotorium
especially
its

the

a

examine
its
composition

fig
the

of

whole

as

we
distinguish
first
between
the
axial

skeleton
and
the
skeleton
of
the
limbs
the
axial
skeleton
consists
of
the
vertebral
column
the
skeleton
of
the

the
skull

of
the

the

a
peculiarly

the

fig
in

continuous

these
are
separated
from
each
other
by
elastic
ligaments

at
the

connected

that
the
whole
column
forms
a
firm

solid

flexible
and
elastic
axial
skeleton
moving
freely
in
all
directions
the
vertebræ
differ
in
shape
and
connection
at
the
various
parts
of

we
distinguish
the
following
groups
in

beginning
at

seven
cervical
vertebræ
twelve
dorsal
vertebræ
five
lumbar

have
a
hole
in

lateral

are
seven
of
these
vertebræ
in

almost
all
the
other

even
if
the
neck
is
as
long
as
that
of
the
camel

giraffe
or
as
short
as
that
of
the
mole
or
hedgehog
this
constant
number
which
has
few
exceptions
due
to
adaptation
is
a
strong
proof
of
the
common
descent
of
the
mammals
it
can
only
be
explained
by
faithful
heredity
from
a
common
a
primitive
mammal
with
seven
cervical
vertebræ
if
each
species
had
been
created
separately
it
would
have
been
better

have
given
the
mammals
more

the

less

next

come
the
dorsal

vertebræ

number
twelve

thirteen

have
at

a

came

at

that
it

nothing

a

in

noticed
at

also
could
be
traced
to
vertebræ

the
three
cranial
vertebræ

when
oken
without

found
at

the
thought
flashed
across
him
like

is
a
vertebral
this
famous
vertebral
theory
of
the
skull
has
interested
the
most
distinguished
zoologists
for
more
than
a
century
the
chief
representatives
of
comparative
anatomy
have
devoted
their
highest
powers
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
and
the
interest
has
spread
far
beyond
their
circle
but
it
was
not
until
that
it
was
happily
solved
after
seven
labour
by
the
comparative
anatomist
who
surpassed
all
other
experts
of
this
science
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
richness
of
his
empirical
knowledge
and
the
acuteness
and
depth
of
his
philosophic
speculations
carl
gegenbaur
has
shown
in
his
classic
of
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
third
section
that
we
find
the
most
solid
foundation
for
the
vertebral
theory
of
the
skull
in
the
of
the
selachii
earlier
anatomists
had
wrongly
started
from
the
mammal
skull
and
had
compared
the
several
bones
that
compose
it
with
the
several
parts
of
the
vertebra
fig
they
thought
they
could
prove
in
this
way
that
the

back
from
the
older
theory
was
refuted
by
simple
and
obvious
facts
which
were
first
pointed
out
by
huxley
nevertheless
the
fundamental
idea
of
belief
that
the
skull
is
formed
from
the
of
the
perichordal
axial
skeleton
just
as
the
brain
is
from
the
simple
medullary
tube
by
differentiation
and
the
work
now
was
to
discover
the
proper
way
of
supplying
this
philosophic
theory
with
an
empirical
foundation
and
it
was
reserved
for
gegenbaur
to
achieve
this
he
first
opened
out
the
phylogenetic
path
which
here
as
in
all
morphological
questions
leads
most
confidently
to
the
goal
he
showed
that
the
primitive
fishes
figs
the
ancestors
of
all
the
gnathostomes
still
preserve
permanently
in
the
form
of
their
skull
the
structure
out
of
which
the
transformed
skull
of
the
higher
vertebrates
including
man
has
been
evolved
he
further
showed
that
the
branchial
arches
of
the
selachii
prove
that
their
skull
originally
consisted
of
a
large
number
of
at
least
nine
or
ten
provertebræ
and
that
the
cerebral
nerves
that
proceed
from
the
base
of
the
brain
entirely
confirm
this
these
cerebral
nerves
are
with
the
exception
of
the
first
and
second
pair
the
olfactory
and
optic
nerves
merely
modifications
of
spinal
nerves
and
are
essentially
similar
to
them
in
their
peripheral
expansion
the
comparative
anatomy
of
these
cerebral
nerves
their
origin
and
their
expansion
furnishes
one
of
the
strongest
arguments

refer
the

to
the
great

i
have
mentioned
in
which
it
is
thoroughly
established
from
the
point

view
he
has
also
given
a
comprehensive
and
treatment
of

subject

finally
six

in

narrower
sense
from
the
anatomic
features
of
these
nine
to
ten
cranial
ribs
or
vertebral
and
the
cranial
nerves
that
spread
over
them
it
is
clear
that
the
apparently
simple
cartilaginous
primitive
skull
of
the
selachii
was
originally
formed
from
so
many
at
least
nine
somites
or
provertebræ
the
blending
of
these
primitive
segments
into
a
single
capsule
is
however
so
ancient
that
in
virtue
of
the
law
of
curtailed
heredity
the
original
division
seems
to
have
disappeared
in
the
embryonic
development
it
is
very
difficult
to
detect
it
in
isolated
traces
and
in
some
respects
quite
impossible
it
is
claimed
that
several
three
to
six
traces
of
provertebræ
have
been
discovered
in
the
anterior
part
of
the
this
would
bring
up
the
number
of
cranial
somites
to
twelve
or
sixteen
or
even
more
in
the
primitive
skull
of
man
fig
and
the
higher
vertebrates
which
has
been
evolved
from
that
of
the
selachii
five
consecutive
sections
are
discoverable
at
a
certain
early
period
of
development
and
one
might
be
induced
to
trace
these
to
five
primitive
vertebræ
but
these
sections
are
due
entirely
to
adaptation
to
the
five
primitive
cerebral
vesicles
and
correspond
like
these
to
a
large
number
of
metamera
that
we
have
in
the
primitive
skull
of
the
mammals
a
greatly
modified
and
transformed
organ
and
not
at
all
a
primitive
formation
is
clear
from
the
circumstance
that
its
original
soft
membranous
form
only
assumes
the
cartilaginous
character
for
the
most
part
at
the
base
and
the
sides
and
remains
membranous
at
the
roof
at
this
part
the
bones
of
the
subsequent
osseous
skull
develop
as
external
coverings
over
the
membranous
structure
without
an
intermediate
cartilaginous
stage
as
there
is
at
the
base
of
the
skull
thus
a
large
part
of
the
cranial
bones
develop
originally
as
covering
bones
from
the
corium
and
only
secondarily
come
into
close
touch
with
the
primitive
skull
fig
we
have
previously
seen
how
this
very
rudimentary
beginning
of
the
skull
in
man
is
formed
ontogenetically
from
the
and
thus
the
fore
end
of
the

have
found
the

important

arise

thorough
comparative

of
the

another
school

research
the
school
of
what
is
called
in
the
sense
of
virchow
has
meantime
made
fruitless
efforts
to
obtain
this
result
we
may
gratefully
acknowledge
all
that
this
descriptive
school
has
done
in
the
way
of
accurately
describing
the
various
forms
and
measurements
of
the
human
skull
as
compared
with
those
of
other
mammals
but
the
vast
empirical
material
that
it
has
accumulated
in
its
extensive
literature
is
mere
dead
and
sterile
erudition
until
it
is
vivified
and
illumined
by
phylogenetic
speculation
virchow
confined
himself
to
the
most
careful
analysis
of
large
numbers
of
human
skulls
and
those
of
anthropoid
mammals
he
saw
only
the
differences
between
them
and
sought
to
express
these
in

he
rejected

as
an
unproved

he
played
a
most
unfortunate
part
in
the
controversy
as
to
the
significance
of
the
fossil
human
skulls
of
spy
and
neanderthal
and
the
comparison
of
them
with
the
skull
of
the
pithecanthropus
fig
all
the
interesting
features
of
these
skulls
that
clearly
indicated
the
transition
from
the
anthropoid
to
the
man
were
declared
by
virchow
to
be
chance
pathological
variations
he
said
that

of
the
skull
of

must
have
belonged
to
an
ape

so
pronounced

horizontal
constriction

not

human

immediately
afterwards
nehring
showed
in
the
skull
of
a
brazilian
indian
fig
found
in
the
sambaquis
of
santos
that
this
stricture
can
be
even
deeper
in
man
than
in
many
of
the
apes
it
is
very
instructive
in
this
connection
to
compare
the
roofs
of
the
skulls
seen
from
above
of
different
primates
i
have
therefore
arranged
nine
such
skulls

reduced

to

turn
now

natural
philosophers

side
by
the
junction
of
its
two
halves
the
fourth
branchial
arch
is
only
found
transitorily
in
the
mammal
embryo
as
a
rudimentary
organ
and
does
not
develop
special
parts

there
is
no
trace
in
the
embryo
of
the
higher
vertebrates

the
posterior
branchial
arches

and
sixth

are
permanent

have
been
lost

ago

only
interesting

rudimentary
organs

they
soon
close

figs
it
was
carl
gegenbaur
again
who
solved
the
difficult
problem
of
tracing
the
skeleton
of
the
limbs
of
the
vertebrates
to
a
common
type
few
parts
of
the
vertebrate
body
have
undergone
such
infinitely
varied
modifications
in
regard
to
size
shape
and
adaptation
of
structure
as
the
limbs
or
extremities
yet
we
are
in
a
position
to
reduce
them
all
to
the
same
hereditary
standard
we
may
generally
distinguish
three
groups
among
the
vertebrates
in
relation
to
the
formation
of
their
limbs
the
lowest
and
earliest
vertebrates
the
acrania
and
cyclostomes
had
like
their
invertebrate
ancestors
no
pairs
of
limbs
as
we
see
in
the
amphioxus
and
the
cyclostomes
figs
the
second
group
is
formed
of
the
two
classes
of
the
true
fishes
and
the
dipneusts
here
there
are
always
two
pairs
of
limbs
at
first
in
the
shape
of
pair
of
or
fore
legs
and
one
pair
of
or
hind
legs
figs
the
third
group
comprises
the
four
higher
classes
of
amphibia
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
in
these
quadrupeds
there
are
at
first
the
same
two
pairs
of
limbs
but
in
the
shape
of
feet
frequently
we
find
less
than
five
toes
and
sometimes
the
feet
are
wholly
atrophied
as
in
the
serpents
but
the
original
of
the
group
had
five
toes
or
fingers
before
and
behind
figs
the
true
primitive
form
of
the
pairs
of
limbs
such
as
they
were
found
in
the
primitive
fishes
of
the
silurian
period
is
preserved
for
us
in
the
australian
dipneust
the
remarkable
fig
both
the
and
the
are
flat
oval
paddles
in
which
we
find
a
biserial
cartilaginous
skeleton
fig
this
consists
firstly
of
a
much
segmented
or
which
runs
through
the
fin
from
base
to
tip
and
secondly
of
a
double
row
of
thin
articulated
which
are
attached
to
both
sides
of
the
like
the
feathers
of
a
feathered
leaf
this
primitive
fin
which
gegenbaur
first
recognised
is
attached
to
the
vertebral
column
by
a
simple
zone
in
the
shape
of
a
cartilaginous
arch
it
has
probably
originated
from
the
branchial
arches
while
gegenbaur
derives
the
fins
from
two
pairs
of
posterior
separated
branchial
arches
balfour
holds
that
they
have
been
developed
from
segments
of
a
pair
of
originally
continuous
lateral
fins
or
folds
of
the
skin
we
find
the
same
biserial
primitive
fin
more
or
less
preserved
in
the
fossilised
remains
of
the
earliest
selachii
fig
ganoids
fig
and
dipneusts
fig
it
is
also
found
in
modified
form
in
some
of
the
actual
sharks
and
pikes
but
in
the
majority
of
the
selachii
it
has
already
degenerated
to
the
extent
that
the
radii
on
one
side
of
the
have
been
partly
or
entirely
lost
and
are
retained
only
on
the
other
fig
we
thus
get
the
uniserial
fin
which
has
been
transmitted
from
the
selachii
to
the
rest
of
the
fishes
fig
gegenbaur
has
shown
how
the
leg
of
the
amphibia
that
has
been
inherited
by
the
three
classes
of
amniotes
was
evolved
from
the
uniserial
the
limb
of
the
four
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
is
now
explained
in
the
sense
that
the
original
passes
along
its
outer
ulnar
or
fibular
side
and
ends
in
the
fifth
toe
it
was
formerly
believed
to
go
along
the
inner
radial
or
tibial
side
and
end
in
the
first
toe
as
fig
shows
in
the
dipneust
ancestors
of
the
amphibia
the
radii
gradually
atrophy
and
are
lost
for
the
most
part
on
the
other
side
of
the

the
lighter
cartilages

the

on

formed
by
gradual

the

of
the

was
accompanied
by
a
further
differentiation
of
the
its
transverse
segmentation
into
upper
and

halves

the
formation
of
the
zone
of
the

which
is
composed
originally
of
three
limbs
before
and
behind
in
the
higher
vertebrates
the
simple
arch
of
the
original
divides
on
each
side
into
an
upper
dorsal
piece
the
and
a
lower
ventral
piece
the
anterior
part
of
the
latter
forms
the
primitive
clavicle
and
the
posterior
part

in
the
same
way
the
simple
arch
of
the
pelvic
zone
breaks
up
into
an
upper
dorsal
piece
the
and
a
lower
ventral
piece
the
anterior
part
of
the
latter
forms
the
pubic
bone

the
posterior
the
ischial
bone
there
is
also
a
complete
agreement
between
the
fore
and
hind
limb
in
the
stem
or

the
first
section
of
the
stem
is
supported
by
a
single
strong
humerus
in
the
fore
the
femur
in
the
hind
limb
the
second
section
contains
two
bones
in
front
the
radius
and
ulna
behind
the
tibia
and
fibula
cf
the
skeletons
in
figs
and
the
succeeding
numerous
small
bones
of
the
wrist
and
ankle
are
also
similarly
arranged
in
the
fore
and
hind
extremities
and
so
are
the
five
bones
of
the
and
finally
it
is
the
same
with
the
toes
themselves
which
have
a
similar
characteristic
composition
from
a
series
of
bony
pieces
before
and
behind
we
find
a
complete
parallel
in
all
the
parts
of
the
fore
leg
and
the
hind
leg
when
we
thus
learn
from
comparative
anatomy
that
the
skeleton
of
the
human
limbs
is
composed
of
just
the
same
bones
put
together
in
the
same
way
as
the
skeleton
in
the
four
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
we
may
at
once
infer
a
common
descent
of
them
from
a
single
this
was
the
earliest
amphibian
that
had
five
toes
on
each
foot
it
is
particularly
the
outer
parts
of
the
limbs
that
have
been
modified
by
adaptation
to
different
conditions
we
need
only
recall
the
immense
variations
they
offer
within
the
mammal
class
we
have
the
slender
legs
of
the
deer
and
the
strong
springing
legs
of
the
kangaroo
the
climbing
feet
of
the
sloth
and
the
digging
feet
of
the
mole
the
fins
of
the
whale
and
the
wings
of
the
bat
it
will
readily
be
granted
that
these
organs
of
locomotion
differ
as
much
in
regard
to
size
shape
and
special
function
as
can
be
conceived
nevertheless
the
bony
skeleton
is
substantially
the
same
in
every
case
in
the
different
limbs
we
always
find
the
same
characteristic
bones
in
essentially
the
same
rigidly
hereditary
connection
this
is
as
splendid
a
proof
of
the
theory
of
evolution
as
comparative
anatomy
can
discover
in
any
organ
of
the
body
it
is
true
that
the
skeleton
of
the
limbs
of
the
various
mammals
undergoes
many
distortions
and
degenerations
besides
the
special
adaptations
fig
thus
we
find
the
first
finger
or
the
thumb
atrophied
in
the
or
hand
of
the
dog
it
has
entirely
disappeared
in
the
pig
and
tapir
in
the
ruminants
such
as
the
ox
the
second
and
fifth
toes
are
also
atrophied
and
only
the
third
and
fourth
are
well
developed
nevertheless
all
these
different
as
well
as
the
hand
of
the
ape
fig
and
of
man
fig
were
originally
developed
from
a
common
pentadactyle
this
is
proved
by
the
rudiments
of
the
degenerated
toes
and
by
the
similarity
of
the
arrangement
of
the
in
all
the
pentanomes
fig
if
we
candidly
compare
the
bony
skeleton
of
the
human
arm
and
hand
with
that
of
the
nearest
anthropoid
apes
we
find
an
almost
perfect
identity
this
is
especially
true
of
the
chimpanzee
in
regard
to
the
proportions
of
the
various
parts
the
lowest
living
races
of
men
the
veddahs
of
ceylon
fig
are
midway
between
the
chimpanzee
fig
and
the
european
fig
more
considerable
are
the
differences
in
structure
and
the
proportions
of
the
various
parts
between
the
different
genera
of
anthropoid
apes
figs
and
still
greater
is
the
morphological
distance
between
these
and
the
lowest
apes
the
here
again
impartial
and
thorough
anatomic
comparison
confirms
the
accuracy
of
pithecometra
principle
the
complete
unity
of
structure
which
is
thus
revealed
by
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
limbs
is
fully
confirmed
by
their
embryology
however
different
the
extremities
of
the
craniotes
may
be
in
their
adult
state
they
all
develop
from
the
same
rudimentary
structure
in
every
case
the
first
trace
of
the
limb
in
the
embryo
is
a
very
simple
protuberance
that
grows
out
of
the
side
of
the
hyposoma
these
simple
structures
develop
directly
into
fins
in
the
fishes
and
dipneusts
by
differentiation
of
their
cells
in
the
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
each
of
the
four
takes
the
shape
in
its
further
growth
of
a
leaf
with
a
stalk
the
inner
half
becoming
narrower
and
thicker
and
the
outer
half
broader
and
thinner
the
inner
half
the
stalk
of
the
leaf
then
divides
into
two
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
limb
afterwards
four
shallow
indentations
are
formed
at
the
free
edge
of
the
leaf
and
gradually
deepen
these
are
the
intervals
between
the
five
toes
fig
the
toes
soon
make
their
appearance
but
at
first
all
five
toes
both
of
fore
and
hind
feet
are
connected
by
a
thin
membrane
like
a
they
remind
us
of
the
original
shaping
of
the
foot
as
a
paddling
fin
the
further
development
of
the
limbs
from
this
rudimentary
structure
takes
place
in
the
same
way
in
all
the
vertebrates
according
to
the
laws
of
heredity
the
embryonic
development
of
the
muscles
or
organs
of
locomotion
is
not
less
interesting
than
that
of
the
skeleton
or
organs
but
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
muscular
system
are
much
more
difficult
and
inaccessible
and
consequently
have
hitherto
been
less
studied
we
can
therefore
only
draw
some
general
phylogenetic
conclusions
therefrom
it
is
incontestable
that
the
musculature
of
the
vertebrates
has
been
evolved
from
that
of
lower
invertebrates
and
among
these
we
have
to
consider
especially
the
unarticulated
vermalia
they
have
a
simple
cutaneous
muscular
layer
developing
from
the
mesoderm
this
was
afterwards
replaced
by
a
pair
of
internal
lateral
muscles
that
developed
from
the
middle
wall
of
the
we
still
find
the
first
rudiments
of
the
muscles
arising
from
the
of
these
in
the
embryos
of
all
the
vertebrates
cf
figs
in
the
unarticulated
of
the
chordonia
which
we
have
called
the
prochordonia
the
two
and
therefore
also
the
of
their
walls
were
not
yet
segmented
a
great
advance
was
made
in
the
articulation
of
them
as
we
have
followed
it
step
by
step
in
the
amphioxus
figs
this
segmentation
of
the
muscles
was
the
momentous
historical
process
with
which
vertebration
and
the
development
of
the
vertebrate
stem
began
the
articulation
of
the
skeleton
came
after
this
segmentation
of
the
muscular
system
and
the
two
entered
into
very
close
correlation
the
episomites
or
dorsal
of
the
acrania
cyclostomes
and
selachii
fig
first
develop
from
their
inner
or
median
wall
from
the
that
lies
directly
on
the
skeletal
plate
and
the
medullary
tube
a
strong
by
dorsal
growth
it
also
reaches
the
external
wall
of
the
and
proceeds
from
the
dorsal
to
the
ventral
wall
from
these
segmental
which
are
chiefly
concerned
in
the
segmentation
of
the
vertebrates
proceed
the
lateral
muscles
of
the
stem
as
we
find
in
the
simplest
form
in
the
amphioxus
fig
by
the
formation
of
a
horizontal
frontal
septum
they
divide
on
each
side
into
an
upper
and
lower
series
of
myotomes
dorsal
and
ventral
lateral
muscles
this
is
seen
with
typical
regularity
in
the
transverse
section
of
the
tail
of
a
fish
fig
from
these
earlier
lateral
muscles
of
the
trunk
develop
the
greater
part
of
the
subsequent
muscles
of
the
trunk
and
also
the
much
later
of
the
limbs
the
ontogeny
of
the
muscles
is
mostly
cenogenetic
the
greater
part
of
the
muscles
of
the
head
or
the
visceral
muscles
belong
originally
to
the
hyposoma
of
the
vertebrate
organism
and
develop
from
the
wall
of
the
hyposomites
or
ventral
this
also
applies
originally
to
the
primary
muscles
of
the
limbs
as
these
too
belong
phylogenetically
to
the
hyposoma

the
chief
of
the
vegetal
organs
of

frame
to
the
evolution
of
which
we
now
turn
our
attention
is
the
alimentary
canal
the
gut
is
the
oldest
of
all
the
organs
of
the
metazoic
body
and
it
leads
us
back
to
the
earliest
age
of
the
formation
of
the
first
section
of
the
laurentian
period
as
we
have
already
seen
the
result
of
the
first
division
of
labour
among
the
homogeneous
cells
of
the
earliest
multicellular
animal
body
was
the
formation
of
an
alimentary
cavity
the
first
duty
and
first
need
of
every
organism
is
this
is
met
by
the
functions
of
the
nutrition
and
the
covering
of
the
body
when
therefore
in
the
primitive
globular
the
homogeneous
cells
began
to
effect
a
division
of
labour
they
had
first
to
meet
this
twofold
need
one
half
were
converted
into
alimentary
cells
and
enclosed
a
digestive
cavity
the
gut
the
other
half
became
covering
cells
and
formed
an
envelope
round
the
alimentary
tube
and
the
whole
body
thus
arose
the
primary
germinal
inner
alimentary
or
vegetal
layer
and
the
outer
covering
or
animal
layer
cf
pp
when
we
try
to
construct
an
animal
frame
of
the
simplest
conceivable
type
that
has
some
such
primitive
alimentary
canal
and
the
two
primary
layers
constituting
its
wall
we
inevitably
come
to
the
very
remarkable
embryonic
form
of
the
gastrula
which
we
have
found
with
extraordinary
persistence
throughout
the
whole
range
of
animals
with
the
exception
of
the
the
sponges
cnidaria
platodes
vermalia
molluscs
articulates
echinoderms
tunicates
and
vertebrates
in
all
these
stems
the
gastrula
recurs
in
the
same
very
simple
form
it
is
certainly
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
gastrula
is
found
in
various
animals
as
a
in
their
individual
development
and
that
this
gastrula
though
much
disguised
by
cenogenetic
modifications
has
everywhere
essentially
the
same
palingenetic
structure
figs
the
elaborate
alimentary
canal
of
the
higher
animals
develops
ontogenetically
from
the
same
simple
primitive
gut
of
the
this
gastræa
theory
is
now
accepted
by
nearly
all
zoologists
it
was
first
supported
and
partly
modified
by
professor
he
proposed
three
years
afterwards
in
his
essay
on
the
development
of
the
molluscs
to
give
the
name
of
to
the
primitive
gut
and
to
the
primitive
mouth
before
we
follow
the
development
of
the
human
alimentary
canal
in
detail
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
word
about
the
general
features
of
its
composition
in
the
man
the
mature
alimentary
canal
in
man
is
constructed
in
all
its
main
features
like
that
of
all
the
higher
mammals
and
particularly
resembles
that
of
the
catarrhines
the
apes
of
the
old
world
the
entrance
into
it
the
mouth
is
armed
with
teeth
fixed
in
rows
in
the
upper
and
lower
jaws
as
we
have
seen
our
dentition

they
are
partly
lost

entirely
in

in

nothing
is
left
but
a
relic
of
the
first
this
is
formed
into
a
part
of
the
organ
of
hearing
from
it
are
developed
the
external
meatus
the
tympanic
cavity
and
the
eustachian
tube
we
have
already
considered
these
remarkable
structures
and
need
only
point
here
to
the
interesting
fact
that
our
middle
and
external
ear
is
a
modified
inheritance
from
the
fishes
the
branchial
arches
also
which
separate
the
clefts
develop
into
very
different
parts
in
the
fishes
they
remain
supporting
the
respiratory
it
is
the
same
with
the
lowest
amphibia
but
in
the
higher
amphibia
they
undergo
various
modifications
and
in
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
including
man
the
hyoid
bone
and
the
ossicles
of
the
ear
develop
from
them
cf
p
from
the
first
from
the
inner
surface
of
which
the
muscular
tongue
proceeds
we
get
the
first
structure
of
the
maxillary
upper
and
lower
jaws
which
surround
the
mouth
and
support
the
teeth
these
important
parts
are
wholly
wanting
in
the
two
lowest
classes
of
vertebrates
the
acrania
and
cyclostoma
they
appear
first
in
the
earliest
selachii
figs
and
have
been
transmitted
from
this
of
the
gnathostomes
to
the
higher
vertebrates
hence
the
original
formation
of
the
skeleton
of
the
mouth
can
be
traced
to
these
primitive
fishes
from
which
we
have
inherited
it
the
teeth
are
developed
from
the
skin
that
clothes
the
jaws
as
the
whole
mouth
cavity
originates
from
the
outer
integument
fig
the
teeth
also
must
come
from
it
as
a
fact
this
is
found
to
be
the
case
on
microscopic
examination
of
the
development
and
finer
structure
of
the
teeth
the
scales
of
the
fishes
especially
of
the
shark
type
fig
are
in
the
same
position
as
their
teeth
in
this
respect
fig
the
osseous
matter

the

dentine
develops
from
the
corium
its
enamel
covering
is
a
secretion
of
the
epidermis
that
covers
the
corium
it
is
the
same
with
the
cutaneous
teeth
or
placoid
scales
of
the
selachii
at
first
the
whole
of
the
mouth
was
armed
with
these
cutaneous
teeth
in
the
selachii
and
in
the
earliest
amphibia
afterwards
the
formation
of
them
was
restricted
to
the
edges
of
the
jaws
median
section
of
the
head
of
a
fig
section
of
the
head
of
a

it
in
the
gullet
we
see
the
internal
openings
of
the
seven
velum
mouth
heart
auditory
vesicle
neural
tube
chorda
hence
our
human
teeth
are
in
relation
to
their
original
source
modified
for
the
same
reason
we
must
regard
the
salivary
glands
which
open
into
the
mouth
as
epidermic
glands
as
they
are
formed
not
from
the
glandular
layer
of
the
gut
like
the
rest
of
the
alimentary
glands
but
from
the
epidermis
from
the
horny
plate
of
the
outer
germinal
layer
naturally
in
harmony
with
this
evolution
of
the
mouth
the
salivary
glands
belong
genetically
to
one
series
with
the
sudoriferous
sebaceous
and
mammary
glands
thus
the
human
alimentary
canal
is
as
simple
as
the
primitive
gut
of
the
gastrula
in
its
original
structure
later
it
resembles
the
gut
of
the
earliest
vermalia
gastrotricha
it
then
divides
into
two
sections
a
fore
or
branchial
gut
and
a
hind
or
hepatic
gut
like
the
alimentary
canal
of
the
balanoglossus
the
ascidia
and
the
amphioxus
the
formation
of
the
jaws
and
the
branchial
arches
changes
it
into
a
real
but
the
branchial
gut
the
one
reminiscence
of
our
is
afterwards
atrophied
as
such
the
parts
of
it
that
remain
are
converted

entirely
different

but
although
the
anterior
section
of
our
alimentary
canal
thus
entirely
loses
its
original
character
of
branchial
gut
it
retains
the
physiological
character
of
respiratory
gut
we
are
now
astonished
to
find
that
the
permanent
respiratory
organ
of
the
higher
vertebrates
the
lung
is
developed
from
this
first
part
of
the
alimentary
canal
our
lungs
trachea
and
larynx
are
formed
from
the
ventral
wall
of
the
branchial
gut
the
whole
of
the
respiratory
apparatus
which
occupies
the
greater
part
of
the
pectoral
cavity
in
the
adult
man
is
at
first
merely
a
small
pair
of
vesicles
or
sacs
which
grow
out
of
the
floor
of
the
immediately
behind
the
gills
figs
these
vesicles
are
found
in
all
the
vertebrates
except
the
two
lowest
classes
the
acrania
and
cyclostomes
in
the
lower
vertebrates
they
do
not
develop
into
lungs
but
into
a
large
bladder
which
occupies
a
good
deal
of
the
and
has
a
quite
different
purport
it
serves
not
for
breathing
but
to
effect
swimming
movements
up
and
down
and
so
is
a
sort
of
hydrostatic
floating
bladder
of
the
fishes
however
the
human
lungs
and
those
of
all
vertebrates
develop
from
the
same
simple
vesicular
appendage
of
the
that
becomes
the
floating
bladder
in
the
fishes
at
first
this
bladder
has
no
respiratory
function
but
merely
acts
as
hydrostatic
apparatus
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
or
lessening
the
specific
gravity
of
the
body
the
fishes
which
have
a
floating
bladder
can
press
it
together
and
thus
condense
the
air
it
contains
the
air
also
escapes
sometimes
from
the
alimentary
canal
through
an
that
connects
the
floating
bladder
with
the
pharynx
and
is
ejected
by
the
mouth
this
lessens
the
size
of
the
bladder
and
so
the
fish
becomes
heavier
and
sinks
when
it
wishes
to
rise
again
the
bladder
is
expanded
by
relaxing
the
pressure
in
many
of
the
crossopterygii
the
wall
of
the
bladder
is
covered
with
bony
plates
as
in
the
triassic
fig
this
hydrostatic
apparatus
begins
in
the
dipneusts
to
change
into
a
respiratory
organ
the
in
the
wall
of
the
bladder
now
no
longer
merely
secrete
air
themselves
but
also
take
in
fresh
air
through
the
this
process
reaches
its
full
development
in
the
amphibia

these
the
floating
bladder
has
turned
into
lungs
and
the
into
a
trachea
the
lungs
of
the
amphibia
have
been
transmitted
to
the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates
in
the
lowest
amphibia
the
lungs
on
either
side
are
still
very
simple
transparent

with
thin
walls
as
in
the
common
the
triton
it
still
entirely
resembles
the
floating
bladder
of
the
fishes
it
is
true
that
the
amphibia
have
two
lungs
right
and
left
but
the
floating
bladder
is
also
double

many
of
the

as

position
to
trace
the
progressive
growth
of
this
important
organ
from
the
rudimentary
structure
of

lower
amphibia
up
to
the
elaborate
and
delicate
vocal
apparatus
that
we
have
in
the
larynx
of
man
and
of
the
birds
we
must
refer
here
to
an
interesting
rudimentary
organ
of
the
respiratory
gut
the
thyroid

the
large
gland
in

fully

nutrition
of
the
body
and
arises
in
the
embryo
by
constriction
from
the
lower
wall
of
the
pharynx
in
many
mining
districts
the
thyroid
gland
is
peculiarly
liable
to
morbid
enlargement
and
then
forms
goitre
a
growth
that
hangs
at
the
front
of
the
neck

it
is
much
more
interesting
phylogenetically
as
wilhelm
müller
of
jena
has
shown
this
rudimentary
organ
is
the
last
relic
of
the
hypobranchial
groove

we
considered
in
a
previous
chapter
and
which
runs
in

important
modifications
among
our
vertebrate
ancestors
than
the
first
section
in
tracing
the
further
development
of
this
digestive
part
of
the
gut
we
find
that
most
complex
and
elaborate
organs
originate
from
a
very
rudimentary
original
structure
for
clearness
we
may
divide
the
digestive
gut
into
three
sections
the
fore
gut

œsophagus
and
stomach
the

gut
duodenum
with
liver
pancreas
jejunum

again
we
find
vesicular
growths
or
appendages
of
the
originally
simple
gut
developing
into
a
variety
of
organs
two
of
these
embryonic
structures

allantois
are
already
known
to
us
the
two
large
glands

open

growths
from
the
middle
and
most
important
part
of

immediately
behind
the
vesicular
rudiments
of
the
lungs
comes
the
section
of
the
alimentary
canal
that
forms
the
stomach
figs
this
organ
which
is
chiefly
responsible
for
the
solution
and
digestion
of
the
food
has
not
in
the
lower
vertebrates
the
great
physiological
importance
and
the
complex
character
that
it
has
in
the
higher
in
the
acrania
and
cyclostomes
and
the
earlier
fishes
we
can
scarcely
distinguish
a
real
stomach
it
is
represented
merely
by
the
short
piece
from
the
branchial
to
the
hepatic
gut
in
some
of
the
other
fishes
also
the
stomach
is
only
a
very
simple
enlargement
at
the
beginning
of
the
digestive
section
of
the
gut
running
straight
from
front
to
back
in
the
median
plane
of
the
body
underneath
the
vertebral
column
in
the
mammals
its
first
structure
is
just
as
rudimentary
as
it
is
permanently
in
the
preceding
but
its
various
parts
soon
begin
to
develop
as
the
left
side
of
the
sac
grows
much
more
quickly
than
the
right
and
as
it
turns
considerably
on
its
axis
at
the
same
time
it
soon
comes
to
lie
obliquely
the
upper
end
is
more
to
the
left
and
the
lower
end
more
to
the
right
the
foremost
end
draws
up
into
the
longer
and
narrower
canal
of
the
œsophagus
underneath
this
on
the
left
the
blind
sac
fundus
of
the
stomach
bulges
out
and
thus
the
later
form
gradually
develops
figs
the
original
longitudinal
axis
becomes
oblique
sinking
below
to
the
left
and
rising
to
the
right

approaches
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
transverse
position

the
outer
layer

the
the
powerful
muscles
that
accomplish
the
digestive
movements

from
the
layer

the
inner
layer
a
number
of
small
glandular
tubes
are
formed
from
the
layer

are
the
peptic
glands
that
secrete
the
gastric
juice

gastric
sac

from
the

pylorus

underneath
the
stomach
there
now
develops
the
disproportionately
long
stretch
of
the
small
intestine
the
development
of
this
section
is
very
simple
and
consists
essentially
in
an
extremely
rapid
and
considerable
growth
lengthways
it
is
at
first
very
short
quite
straight
and
simple
but
immediately
behind
the
stomach
we
find
at
an
early
stage
a
bend
and
loop
of
the
gut
in
connection
with
the
severance
of
the
alimentary
canal
from
the
and
the
development
of
the
first
mesentery
the
thin
delicate
membrane
that
fastens
this
loop
to
the
ventral
side
of
the
vertebral
column
and
fills

inner
bend
of
the
horseshoe
formation

the
first
rudiment
of
the
mesentery

we
find
at
an
early
stage
a
considerable
growth
of
the
small
intestine
it
is
thus
forced
to
coil
itself
in
a
number
of
loops
the
various
sections
that
we
have
to
distinguish
in
it
are
differentiated
in
a
very
simple
duodenum

to
the
stomach
the
succeeding
long
jejunum

the
last
section
of
the
small

ileum
from
the
duodenum
are
developed

two
large
glands
that
we
have
already

the
liver
appears
first
in
the
shape
of
two
small
sacs
that
are
found
to
the
right
and
left
immediately
behind
the
stomach
figs
in
many
of
the
lower
vertebrates
they
remain
separate
for
a
long
time
in
the
myxinoides
throughout
life
or
are
only
imperfectly
joined
in
the
higher
vertebrates
they
soon
blend
more
or
less
completely
to
form
a
single
large
organ
the
growth
of
the
liver
is
very
brisk
at
first
in
the
human
embryo
it
grows
so
much
in
the
second
month
of
development
that
in
the
third
it
occupies
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
fig
at
first
the
two
halves
develop
equally
afterwards
the
left
falls
far
behind
the
right
in
consequence
of
the
unsymmetrical
development
and
turning
of
the
stomach
and
other
abdominal
viscera
the
whole
liver
is
now
pushed
to
the
right
side
although
the
liver
does
not
afterwards
grow
so
disproportionately
it
is
comparatively
larger
in
the
embryo
at
the
end
of
pregnancy
than
in
the
adult
its
weight
relatively
to
that
of
the
whole
body
is
in
the
adult
and
in
the
embryo
hence
it
is
very
important
physiologically
during
embryonic
life
it
is
chiefly
concerned
in
the
formation
of
blood
not
so
much
in
the
secretion
of
bile
immediately
behind
the
liver
a
second
large
visceral
gland
develops
from
the
duodenum
the
pancreas
or
sweetbread
it
is
wanting
in
most
of
the
lowest
classes
of

is
first
found
in
the
fishes
this
organ
is
also
an
outgrowth
from
the
gut
the
last
section
of
the
alimentary
canal
the
large
intestine
is
at
first
in
the
embryo
a
very
simple
short
and
straight
tube
which
opens
behind
by
the
anus
it
remains
thus
throughout
life

the

of

is
the

the

the

at
the
beginning
of

there
is
a

valvula
that
separates

from
the
small

immediately
behind
this
there
is
a
growth
which
enlarges
into
the
cæcum
fig
in
the
mammals
this
is
very
large
but
it
is
very
small
or
completely
atrophied

most
of

only
the

the

of

narrow
and
seems
later
to
be
merely
a
useless
appendage
of
the
former
this
is
very
interesting
as
a
rudimentary
organ
the
only
significance
of
it
in
man
is
that
not
infrequently
a
or
some
other
hard
and
indigestible
matter
penetrates
into
its
narrow
cavity
and
by
setting
up
inflammation
and
suppuration
causes
the
death
of
otherwise
sound
men
teleology
has
great
difficulty
in
giving
a
rational
explanation
of
and
attributing
to
a
beneficent
providence
this
dreaded
appendicitis
in
our
ancestors
this
rudimentary
organ
was
much
larger
and
had
a
useful
function
finally
we
have
important
appendages
of
the
alimentary
tube
in
the
bladder
and
urethra
which
belong
to
the
alimentary
system
these
urinary
organs
acting
as
reservoir
and
duct
for
the
urine
excreted
by
the
kidneys
originate
from
the
innermost
part
of
the
allantoic
pedicle
in
the
dipneusts
and
amphibia
in
which
the
allantoic
sac
first
makes
its
appearance
it
remains
within
the
and
functions
entirely
as
bladder
but
in
all
the
amniotes
it
grows
far
outside
of
the
of
the
embryo
and
forms
the
large
embryonic
bladder
from
which
the
placenta
develops
in
the
higher
mammals
this
is
lost
at
birth
but
the
long
stalk
or
pedicle
of
the
allantois
remains
and
forms
with
its
upper
part
the
middle
ligament
a
rudimentary
organ
that
goes
in
the
shape
of
a
solid
string
from
the
vertex
of
the
bladder
to
the
navel
the
lowest
part
of
the
allantoic
pedicle
or
the
remains
hollow
and
forms
the
bladder
at
first
this
opens
into
the
last
section
of
the
gut
in
man
as
in
the
lower
vertebrates
thus
there
is
a
real
cloaca
which
takes
off
both
urine
and
excrements
but
among
the
mammals
this
cloaca
is
only
permanent
in
the
monotremes
as
it
is
in
all
the
birds
reptiles
and
amphibia
in
all
the
other
mammals
marsupials
and
placentals
a
transverse
partition
is
afterwards
formed

evolution

the
use
that
we
have
hitherto
made
of
our
biogenetic
law
will
give
the
reader
an
idea
how
far
we
may
trust
its
guidance
in
phylogenetic
investigation
this
differs
considerably
in
the
various
systems
of
organs
the
reason
is
that
heredity
and
variability
have
a
very
different
range
in
these
systems
while
some
of
them
faithfully
preserve
the
original
palingenetic
development
inherited
from
earlier
animal
ancestors
others
show
little
trace
of
this
rigid
heredity
they
are
rather
disposed
to
follow
new
and
divergent
lines
of
development
in
consequence
of
adaptation
the
organs
of
the
first
kind
represent
the
element
in
the
multicellular
state
of
the
human
frame
while
the
latter
represent
the
element
the
course
of
historic
development
is
a
result
of
the
correlation
of
the
two
tendencies
and
they
must
be
carefully
distinguished
there
is
perhaps
no
other
system
of
organs
in
the
human
body
in
which
this
is
more
necessary
than
in
that
of
which
we
are
now
going
to
consider
the
obscure
vascular
system
or
apparatus
of
circulation
if
we
were
to
draw
our
conclusions
as
to
the
original
features
in
our
earlier
animal
ancestors
solely
from
the
phenomena
of
the
development
of
this
system
in
the
embryo
of
man
and
the
other
higher
vertebrates
we
should
be
wholly
misled
by
a
number
of
important
embryonic
adaptations
the
chief
of
which
is
the
formation
of
an
extensive
the
original
course
of
the
development
of
the
vascular
system
has
been
so
much
falsified
and
curtailed
in
the
higher
vertebrates
that
little
or
nothing
now
remains
in
their
embryology
of
some
of
the
principal
phylogenetic
features
we
should
be
quite
unable
to
explain
these
if
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
did
not
come
to
our
assistance
the
vascular
system
in
man
and
all
the
craniotes
is
an
elaborate
apparatus
of
cavities
filled
with
juices
or
fluids
these
play
an
important
part
in
the
nutrition
of
the
body
they
partly
conduct
the
nutritive
red
blood
to
the
various
parts
of
the
body
partly
absorb
from
the
gut
the
white
chyle
formed
in
digestion
and
partly
collect
the
juices
and
convey
them
away
from
the
tissues
lymphatic
vessels
with
the
latter
are
connected
the
large
cavities
of
the
body
especially
the
or
cœloma
the
lymphatic
vessels
conduct
both
the
colourless
lymph
and
the
white
chyle
into
the
venous
part
of
the
circulation
the
lymphatic
glands
act
as
producers
of
new
and
with
them
is
associated
the
spleen
the
centre
of
movement
for
the
circulation
of
the
fluids
is
the
heart
a
strong
muscular
sac
which
contracts
regularly
and
is
equipped
with
valves
like
a
pump
this
constant
and
steady
circulation
of
the
blood
makes
possible
the
complex
metabolism
of
the
higher
animals
but
however
important
the
vascular
system
may
be
to
the
more
advanced
and
larger
and
animals
it
is
not
at
all
so
indispensable
an
element
of
animal
life
as
is
commonly
supposed
the
older
science
of
medicine
regarded
the
blood
as
the
real
source
of
life
even
in
the
still
prevalent
confused
notions
of
heredity
the
blood
plays
the
chief
part
people
speak
generally
of
full
blood
half
blood
and
imagine
that
the
hereditary
transmission
of
certain
characters
in
the
the
incorrectness
of
these
ideas
is
clearly
seen
from
the
fact
that
in
the
act
of
generation
the
blood
of
the
parents
is
not
directly
transmitted
to
the
offspring
nor
does
the
embryo
possess
blood
in
its
early
stages
we
have
already
seen
that
not
only
the
differentiation
of
the
four
secondary
germinal
layers
but
also
the
first
structures
of
the
principal
organs
in
the
embryo
of
all
the
vertebrates
take
place
long
before
there
is
any
trace
of
the
vascular
heart
and
the
blood
in
accordance
with
this
ontogenetic
fact
we
must
regard
the
vascular
system
as
one
of
the
latest
organs
from
the
phylogenetic
point
of
view
just
as
we
have
found
the
alimentary
canal
to
be
one
of
the
earliest

any

these

just

in

from

to

the

so

may
regard
the

to

find
it
in

we
may
assume
that
the
acrania
that
really
belong
to
our
ancestral
series
did
not
share
this
retrogression
but
inherited
the
heart
of
the
prochordonia
and
transmitted
it
directly
to
the
earliest
craniotes

the

absorb
the

from

it

absorb

measure
the

the

the
one
which
we
are
now
going
to

of
the
reproductive
organs
just
as
nutrition
is
the
first
and
most
urgent
condition
for
the
of
the
individual
organism
so
reproduction
alone
secures
the
maintenance
of
the
rather
the
maintenance
of
the
long
series
of
generations
which
the
totality
of
the
organic
stem
represents
in
their
genealogical
connection
no
individual
organism
has
the
prerogative
of
immortality
to
each
is
allotted
only
a
brief
span
of
personal
development
an
evanescent
moment
in
the
course
of
the
history
of
life
hence
reproduction
and
the
correlative
phenomenon
heredity
have
long
been
regarded
together
with
nutrition
as
the
most
important
and
fundamental
function
of
living
things
and
it
has
been
attempted
to
distinguish
them
from
on
this
very
score
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
division
is
not
so
profound
and
thorough
as
it
seems
to
be
and
is
generally
supposed
to
be
if
we
examine
carefully
the
nature
of
the
reproductive
process
we
soon
see
that
it
can
be
reduced
to
a
general
property
that
is
found
in
inorganic
as
well
as
organic
reproduction
is
a
nutrition
and
growth
of
the
organism
beyond
the
individual
limit
which
raises
a
part
of
it
into
the
whole
this
is
most
clearly
seen
when
we
study
it
in
the
simplest
and
lowest
organisms
especially
the
monera
figs
and
the
unicellular
amœbæ
fig
there
the
simple
individual
is
a
single
plastid
as
soon
as
it
has
reached
a
certain
limit
of
size
by
continuous
feeding
and
normal
growth
it
can
not
pass
it
but
divides
by
simple
cleavage
into
two
equal
halves
each
of
these
halves
then
continues
its
independent
life
and
grows
on
until
it
in
turn
reaches
the
limit
of
growth
and
divides
in
each
of
these
acts
of
two
new
centres
of
attraction
are
formed
for
the
particles
of
bodies
the
foundations
of
the
two
individuals
there
is
no
such
thing
as
immortality
even
in
these
unicellulars
the
individual
as
such
is
annihilated
in
the
act
of
cleavage
cf
in
many
other
protozoa
reproduction
takes
place
not
by
cleavage
but
by
budding
gemmation
in
this
case
the
growth
that
determines
reproduction
is
not
total
as
in
segmentation
but
partial
hence
in
gemmation
also
we
may
oppose
the
local
that
becomes
a
new
individual
in
the
bud
as
a
to
the
from
which
it
is
formed
the
latter
is
older
and
larger
than
the
former
in
cleavage
the
two
products
are
equal
in
age
and
morphological
value
next
to
gemmation
we
have
as
other
forms
of
asexual
reproduction
the
forming
of
embryonic
buds
and
the
forming
of
embryonic
cells
but
the
latter
leads
us
at
once
to
sexual
generation
the
distinctive
feature
of
which
is
the
separation
of
the
sexes
i
have
dealt
fully
with
these
various
types
of
reproduction
in
my
of
chap
viii
and
my
of
chap
xi
the
earliest
ancestors
of
man
and
the
higher
animals
had
no
faculty
of
sexual
reproduction
but
multiplied
solely
by
asexual
gemmation
or
the
formation
of
embryonic
buds
or
cells
as
many
protozoa
still
do
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
came
at
a
later
stage
we
see
this
most
plainly

precedes
the
continuous
cleavage

permanent

may
say
that
in

attained
by
the
coalescence

mixture
of
the
two
plastids

the
copulating
cells
are
quite
homogeneous
but
natural
selection
soon
brings
about
a
certain
contrast
between
female
cells
and
smaller
male
cells
it
must
be
a
great
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life

have
inherited
different

vii

these
simplest
forms
of
sexual
propagation
as
we
can
observe
them
in
the
lowest
zoophytes
the
gastræads
sponges
and
polyps
we
gather
most
important
data
in
the
first
place
we
learn
that
properly
speaking
nothing
is
required
for
sexual
reproduction
except
the
fusion
or
coalescence
of
two
different
female
ovum
and
male
all
other
features
and
all
the
very
complex
phenomena
that
accompany
the
sexual
act
in
the
higher
animals
are
of
a
subordinate
and
secondary
character
and
are
later
additions
to
this
simple
primary
process
of
copulation
and
fecundation
but
if
we
bear
in
mind
how
extremely
important
a
part
this
relation
of
the
two
sexes
plays
in
the
whole
of
organic
nature
in
the
life
of
plants
of
animals
and
of
man
how
the
mutual
attraction
of
the
sexes
love
is
the
mainspring
of
the
most
remarkable
fact
one
of
the
chief
mechanical
causes
of
the
highest
development
of
can
not
too
greatly
emphasise
this
tracing
of
love
to
its
source
the
attractive
force
of
two
erotic
cells

the
whole
of
living

the
greatest
effects
proceed
from
this
very
small
cause
consider
the
part
that
the
flowers
the
sexual
organs
of
the
flowering
plants
play
in
nature
or
the
exuberance
of
wonderful
phenomena
that
sexual
selection
produces
in
animal
life
or
the
momentous
influence
of
love
in
the
life
of
man
in
every
case
the
fusion
of
two
cells
is
the
sole
original
motive

in
every
case
this
invisible
process
profoundly
affects
the
development
of
the
most
varied
structures
we
may
say
indeed
that
no
other
organic
process
can
be
compared
to
it
for
a
moment
in
comprehensiveness
and
intensity
of
action

not

so
many
other
famous
traditions

poetic
expression
of
the
vast
influence
that
love
and
sexual
selection
have
exercised
over
the
course
of
history
ever
since
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
all
the
other
passions
that
agitate
the
heart
of
man
are
far
outstripped
in
their
joint
influence
by
this
and
eros
on
the
one
hand
we
look
to
love
with
gratitude
as
the
source
of
the
greatest
artistic
noblest
creations
of
poetry
plastic
art
and
music
we
see
in
it
the
chief
factor
in
the
moral
advance
of
humanity
the
foundation
of
family
life
and
therefore
of
social
advance
on
the
other
hand
we
dread
it
as
the
devouring
flame
that
brings
destruction
on
so
many
and
has
caused
more
misery
vice
and
crime
than
all
the
other
evils
of
human
life
put
together
so
wonderful
is
love
and
so
momentous
its
influence
on
the
life
of
the
soul
or
on
the
different
functions
of
the
medullary
tube
that
here
more
than
anywhere
else
the
result
seems
to
mock
any
attempt
at
natural
explanation
yet
comparative
evolution
leads
us
clearly
and
indubitably
to
the
first
source
of
affinity
of
two
different
erotic
cells
the
and
ovum
the
sensual
perception
probably
related
to
smell
of
the
two
copulating
which
causes
their
mutual
attraction
is
a
little
understood
but
very
interesting
chemical
function
of
the
cf
and
riddle
of
the
universe
chap
ix
the
lowest
metazoa
throw
light
on
this
very
simple
origin
of
the
intricate
phenomena
of
reproduction
and
they
also
teach
us
that
the
earliest
sexual
form
was
hermaphrodism
and
that
the
separation
of
the
sexes
by
division
of
labour
is
a
secondary
and
later
phenomenon
hermaphrodism
predominates
in
the
most
varied
groups
of
the
lower
animals
each
individual
each
person
contains
female
and
male
sexual
cells
and
is
therefore
able
to
fertilise
itself
and
reproduce
thus
we
find
ova
and
in
the
same
individual
not
only
in
the
lowest
zoophytes
gastræads
sponges
and
many
polyps
but
also
in
many
worms
leeches
and
earthworms
many
of
the
snails
the
common
garden
and
vineyard
snails
all
the
tunicates
and
many
other
invertebrate
animals
all
earlier
invertebrate
ancestors
from
the
gastræads
up
to
the
prochordonia
were
hermaphrodites
possibly
even
the
earliest
acrania
we
have
an
instructive
proof
of
this
in
the
remarkable
circumstance
that
many
genera
of
fishes
are
still
hermaphrodites
and
that
it
is
occasionally
found
in
the
higher
vertebrates
of
all
classes
as
atavism
we
may
conclude
from
this
that
gonochorism
separation
of
the
sexes
was
a
later
stage
in
our
development
at
first
male
and
female
individuals
differ
only
in
the
possession
of
one
or
other
kind
of
gonads
in
other
respects
they
were
identical
as
we
still
find
in
the
amphioxus
and
the
cyclostomes
afterwards
accessory
organs
ducts
etc
are
associated
with
the
primary
sexual
glands
and
much
later
again
sexual
selection
has
given
rise
to
the
secondary
sexual
differences
between
the
sexes
which
do
not
affect
the
sexual
organs
themselves
but
other
parts
of
the
body
such
as
the
beard
or
the
breast
the
third
important
fact
that
we
learn
from
the
lower
zoophytes
relates
to
the
earliest
origin
of
the
two
kinds
of
sexual
cells
as
in
the
gastræads
the
lowest
sponges
and
hydroids
in
which
we
find
the
first
beginnings
of
sexual
differentiation
the
whole
body
consists
merely
of
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
it
follows
that
the
sexual
cells
also
must
have
proceeded
from
the
cells
of
these
primary
layers
either
the
inner
or
outer
or
from
both
this
simple
fact
is
extremely
important
because
the
first
trace
of
the
ova
as
well
as
the
spermatozoa
is
found
in
the
middle
germinal
layer
or
mesoderm
in
the
higher
animals
especially
the
vertebrates
this
arrangement
is
a
later
development
from
the
preceding
in
connection
with
the
secondary
formation
of
the
mesoderm
if
we
trace
the
phylogeny
of
the
sexual
organs
in
our
earliest
metazoa
ancestors
as
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
of
the
lowest
cœlenteria
exhibit
it
to
us
we
find
that
the
first
step
in
advance
is
the
localisation
or
concentration
of
the
two
kinds
of
sexual
cells
scattered
in
the
epithelium
into
definite
groups
in
the
sponges
and
lowest
hydropolyps
isolated
cells
are
detached
from
the
of
the
two
primary
germinal
layers
and
become
free
sexual
cells
but
in
the
cnidaria
and
platodes
we
find
these
associated
in
groups
which
we
call
sexual
glands
we
can
now
for
the
first
time
speak
of
sexual
organs
in
the
morphological
sense
the
female
germinative
glands
which
in
this
simplest
form
are
merely
groups
of
homogeneous
cells
are
the
ovaries
fig
the
male
germinative
glands
which
also
in
their
first
form
consist
of
a
cluster
of
are
the
testicles
fig
in
the
medusæ
which
descend
both
ontogenetically
and
phylogenetically
from
the
more
simply
organised
polyps
we
find
these
simple
sexual
glands
sometimes
as
gastric
pouches
sometimes
as
outgrowths
of
the
radial
canals
that
proceed
from
the
stomach
particularly
interesting
in
connection
with
the
question
of
the
first
origin
of
the
gonads
are
the
lowest
forms
of
the
platodes

that
have
of
late
been
separated
as
a
special
class
from
the
turbellaria

fig
in
these
very
primitive
platodes
the
two
pairs
of

the
entodermic

very
clearly

find
at

early
stage
a

in

we
find
other

taking

the
chief
of

secondary
sexual
organs
are
the
gonoducts

serve
to
convey
the
mature
sexual
cells
out
of

the
copulative
organs

bring

less

these
also
are
secondary

the
original
and
genetic
relation
of
these
two
kinds
of
ducts
is
just
the

in
man
as
in
the
rest
of
the
higher

quite
different
from
what
we
find
in
most
of
the
invertebrates
in
the
latter
as
a
rule
the
gonoducts
develop
directly
from
the
embryonic
glands
or
from
the
outer
skin

in
the
vertebrates
an
independent
organic
system
is
employed
to
convey
the
sexual
products
and
this
had
originally
a
totally
different
the
system
of
urinary
organs
these
organs
have
primarily
the
sole
duty
of
removing
unusable
matter
from
the
body
in
a
fluid
form
their
liquid
excretory
product
the
urine
is
either
evacuated
directly
through
the
skin
or
through
the
last
section
of
the
gut
it
is
only
at
a
later
stage
that
the
tubular
urinary
passages
also
convey
the
sexual
products
from
the
body
in
this
way
they
become
this
remarkable
secondary
conjunction
of
the
urinary
and
sexual
organs

it
is
wanting
in

in
order
to
appreciate
it
fully
we
must
give
a
comparative
glance
at
the
structure
of
the
urinary
organs
the
renal
or
urinary
system

one
of
the

and
most
important
systems
of
organs
in

differentiated
animal
body
as

have
pointed
out
on

previous
occasions

xvii
we
find
it
not
only
in
the
higher
stems

also
very
generally
distributed
in

earlier
group
of
the
vermalia

we
meet
it
in

in
the
instructive
stem
of

it
consists

a

are
lined
with

unusable
juices

the
still

consequence
of
their
parasitic
life
are
equipped
with
these

be
conceived
as
tubular
cutaneous

by

they

three

an

the

as

kidneys
act
permanently
as

glands
this
is
only
so
as
a
passing
phase
of
the
early
embryonic
life

the
three
higher
classes
of
vertebrates

are
distinctive
of
these
three
classes
soon
make
their
appearance
they
represent
the
third
and
last
generation
of
the
vertebrate
kidneys
the
permanent
kidneys
do
not
arise
as
was
long
supposed
as
independent
glands
from
the
alimentary
tube
but
from
the
last
section
of
the
primitive
kidneys
and
the
nephroduct
here
a
simple
tube
the
secondary
renal
duct
develops
near
the
point
of
its
entry
into
the
cloaca
and
this
tube
grows
considerably
forward
with
its
blind
upper
or
anterior
end
is
connected
a
glandular
renal
growth
that
owes
its
origin
to
a
differentiation
of
the
last
part
of
the
primitive
kidneys
this
rudiment
of
the
permanent
kidneys
consists
of
coiled
urinary
canals
with
malpighian
capsules
and
vascular
coils
without
ciliated
funnels
of
the
same
structure
as
the
segmental
mesonephridia
of
the
primitive
kidneys
the
further
growth
of
these
metanephridia
gives
rise
to
the
compact
permanent
kidneys
which
have
the
familiar
in
man
and
most
of
the
higher
mammals
but
consist
of
a
number
of
separate
folds
in
the
lower
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
as
the
permanent
kidneys
grow
rapidly
and
advance
forward
their
passage
the
ureter
detaches
altogether
from
its
the
posterior
end
of
the
nephroduct
it
passes
to
the
posterior
surface
of
the
allantois
at
first
in
the
oldest
amniotes
this
ureter
opens
into
the
cloaca
together
with
the
last
section
of
the
nephroduct
but
afterwards
separately
from
this
and
finally
into
the
permanent
bladder
apart
from
the
rectum
altogether
the
bladder
originates
from
the
hindmost
and
lowest
part
of
the
allantoic
pedicle
which
enlarges
in
spindle
shape
before
the
entry
into
the
cloaca
the
anterior
or
upper
part
of
the
pedicle
which
runs
to
the
navel
in
the
ventral
wall
of
the
embryo
atrophies
subsequently
and
only
a
useless
relic
of
it
is
left
as
a
rudimentary
organ
that
is
the
single

the
right

left
of
it

adult
male

a

of

rudimentary

are
the
degenerate
relics
of

earlier

though
in
man
and
all
the
other
amniotes
the
primitive
kidneys
are
thus
early
replaced
by
the
permanent
kidneys
and
these
alone
then
act
as
urinary
organs
all
the
parts
of
the
former
are
by
no
means
lost

important

the
origin

anatomy

to
indicate
that

and
its
capability
of
penetrating
the
vagina
by
certain
special
structures
of
their
spongy
vascular
spaces
also
shows
a
good
deal
of
variety
within
the
vertebrate
stem
this
stiffness
is
increased
in
many
orders
of
mammals
especially
the
carnassia
and
rodents
by
the
ossification
of
a
part
of
the
fibrous
body
this
is
very
large
in
the
badger
and
dog
and
bent
like
a
hook
in
the
marten
it
is
also
very
large
in
some
of
the
lower
apes
and
protrudes
far
out
into
the
glans
it
is
wanting
in
most
of
the
anthropoid
apes
it
seems
to
have
been
lost
in
their
case
and
in
man
by
atrophy
the
sexual
groove
on
the
under
side
of
the
phallus
receives
in
the
male
the
mouth
of
the
urogenital
canal
and
is
changed
into
a
continuation
of
this
becoming
a
closed
canal
by
the
juncture
of
its
parallel
edges
the
male
urethra
in
the
female
this
only
takes
place
in
a
few
cases
some
of
the
lemurs
rodents
and
moles
as
a
rule
the
groove
remains
open
and
the
borders
of
this
of
the
develop
into
the
smaller
labia
the
large
labia
of
the
female
develop
from
the
sexual
pads
the
two
parallel
folds
of
the
skin
that
are
found
on
each
side
of
the
genital
groove
they
join
together
in
the
male
and
form
the
closed
scrotum
these
striking
differences
between
the
two
sexes
can
not
yet
be
detected
in
the
human
embryo
of
the
ninth
week
we
begin
to
trace
them
in
the
tenth
week
of
development
and
they
are
accentuated
in
proportion
as
the
difference
of
the
sexes
develops
sometimes
the
normal
juncture
of
the
two
sexual
pads
in
the
male
fails
to
take
place
and
the
sexual
groove
may
also
remain
open
in
these
cases
the
external
male
genitals
resemble
the
female
and
they
are
often
wrongly
regarded
as
cases
of
hermaphrodism
other
malformations
of
various
kinds
are
not
infrequently
found
in
the
human
external
sexual
organs
and
some
of
them
have
a
great
morphological
interest
the
reverse
of
hypospadia
in
which
the
penis
is
split
open
below
is
seen
in
in
which
the
urethra
is
open
above
in
this
case
the
urogenital
canal
opens
above
at
the
dorsal
root
of
the
penis
in
the
former
case
down
below
these
and
similar
obstructions
interfere
with
a
generative
power
and
thus
prejudicially
affect
his
whole
development
they
clearly
prove
that
our
history
is
not
guided
by
a
providence
but
left
to
the
play
of
blind
chance
we
must
carefully
distinguish
the
rarer
cases
of
real
hermaphrodism
from
the
preceding
this
is
only
found
when
the
essential
organs
of
reproduction
the
genital
glands
of
both
kinds
are
united
in
one
individual
in
these
cases
either
an
ovary
is
developed
on
the
right
and
a
testicle
on
the
left
or
or
else
there
are
testicles
and
ovaries
on
both
sides
some
more
and
others
less
developed
as
hermaphrodism
was
probably
the
original
arrangement
in
all
the
vertebrates
and
the
division
of
the
sexes
only
followed
by
later
differentiation
of
this
these
curious
cases
offer
no
theoretical
difficulty
but
they
are
rarely
found
in
man
and
the
higher
mammals
on
the
other
hand
we
constantly
find
the
original
hermaphrodism
in
some
of
the
lower
vertebrates
such
as
the
myxinoides
many
fishes
of
the
and
some
of
the
amphibia
ringed
snake
toad
in
these
cases
the
male
often
has
a
rudimentary
ovary
at
the
fore
end
of
the
testicle
and
the
female
sometimes
has
a
rudimentary
inactive
testicle
in
the
carp
also
and
some
other
fishes
this
is
found
occasionally
we
have
already
seen
how
traces
of
the
earlier
hemaphrodism
can
be
traced
in
the
passages
of
the
amphibia
man
has
faithfully
preserved
the
main
features
of
his
in
the
ontogeny
of
his
urinary
and
sexual
organs
we
can
follow
their
development
step
by
step
in
the
human
embryo
in
the
same
advancing
gradation
that
is
presented
to
us
by
the
comparison
of
the
urogenital
organs
in
the

cyclostomes
fishes
amphibia
reptiles
and
then
within
the
mammal
series
in
the
monotremes
marsupials
and
the
various
placentals
all
the
peculiarities
of
urogenital
structure
that
distinguish
the
mammals
from
the
rest
of
the
vertebrates
are
found
in
man
and
in
all
special
structural
features
he
resembles
the
apes
particularly
the
anthropoid
apes
in
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
special
features
of
the
mammals
have
been
inherited
by
man
i
will
in
conclusion
point
out
the
identical
way
in
which
the
ova
are
formed
in
the
ovary
in
all
the
mammals
the
mature
ova
are
contained
in
special
capsules
which
are
known
as
the
after
their
discoverer
roger
de
graaf
they
were
formerly
supposed
to
be
the
ova
themselves
but
baer
discovered
the
ova
within
the
follicles
each
follicle
fig
consists
of
a
round
fibrous
capsule
which
contains
fluid
and
is
lined
with
several
strata
of
cells
the
layer
is
thickened
like
a
knob
at
one
point
this
encloses
the
ovum
proper
the
mammal
ovary
is
originally
a
very
simple
oval
body
fig
formed
only
of
connective
tissue
and
covered
with
a
layer
of
cells
the
ovarian
epithelium
or
the
female
germ

from
this
germ

strings
of
cells
grow
out
into
the
connective

or
of
the

some
of
the
cells
of
these
strings
or
tubes
grow
larger
and
become
ova
primitive
ova
but
the
great
majority
remain
small
and
form
a
protective
and
nutritive
stratum
of
cells
round
each

the
mammal
has
at
first
one
stratum

but
afterwards
several
it
is
true
that
in
all
the
other
vertebrates
the
ova
are
enclosed
in
a
membrane
or
that
consists
of
smaller
cells
but
it
is
only
in
the
mammals
that
fluid
accumulates
between
the
growing
and
distends
the
follicle
into
a
large
round
capsule
on
the
inside
wall
of
which
the
ovum
lies
at
one
side
figs
there
again
as
in
the
whole
of
his
morphology
man
proves
indubitably
his
descent
from
the
mammals
in
the
lower
vertebrates
the
formation
of
ova
in
the
of
the
ovary
continues
throughout
life
but
in
the
higher
it
is
restricted
to
the
earlier
stages
or
even
to
the
period
of
embryonic
development
in
man
it
seems
to
cease
in
the
first
year
in
the
second
year
we
find
no
ova
or
chains
of
ova
tubes
however
the
number
of
ova
in
the
two
ovaries
is
very
large
in
the
young
girl
there
are
calculated
to
be
in
the
maiden
in
the
production
of
the
ova
men
resemble
most
of
the
anthropoid
apes
generally
speaking
the
natural
history
of
the
human
sexual
organs
is
one
of
those
parts
of
anthropology
that
furnish
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
the
animal
origin
of
the
human
race
any
man
who
is
acquainted
with
the
facts
and
impartially
weighs
them
will
conclude
from
them
alone
that
we
have
been
evolved
from
the
lower
vertebrates
the
larger
and
the
detailed
structure
the
action
and
the
embryological
development
of
the
sexual
organs
are
just
the
same
in
man
as
in
the
apes
this
applies
equally
to
the
male
and
the
female
the
internal
and
the
external
organs
the
differences
we
find
in
this
respect
between
man
and
the
anthropoid
apes
are
much
slighter
than
the
differences
between
the
various
species
of
apes
but
all
the
apes
have
certainly
a
common
origin
and
have
been
evolved
from
a
which
we
must
trace
to
a
branch
of
the
lemurs
if
we
had
this
unknown
pithecoid
before
us
we
should
certainly
put
it
in
the
order
of
the
true
apes
in
the
primate
system
but
within
this
order
we
can
not
for
the
anatomic
and
ontogenetic
reasons
we
have
seen
separate
man
from
the
group
of
the
anthropoid
apes
here
again
therefore
on
the
ground
of
the
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
teach
with
full
confidence
the

of
man

results
of
anthropogeny
now
that
we
have
traversed
the
wonderful
region
of
human
embryology
and
are
familiar
with
the
principal
parts
of
it
it
will
be
well
to
look
back
on
the
way
we
have
come
and
forward
to
the
further
path
to
truth
to
which
it
has
led
us
we
started
from
the
simplest
facts
of
ontogeny
or
the
development
of
the
observations
that
we
can
repeat
and
verify
by
microscopic
and
anatomic
study
at
any
moment
the
first
and
most
important
of
these
facts
is
that
every
man
like
every
other
animal
begins
his
existence
as
a
simple
cell
this
round
ovum
has
the
same
characteristic
form
and
origin
as
the
ovum
of
any
other
mammal
from
it
is
developed
in
the
same
manner
in
all
the
placentals
by
repeated
cleavage
a
multicellular
blastula
this
is
converted
into
a
gastrula
and
this
in
turn
into
a
blastocystis
or
embryonic
vesicle
the
two
strata
of
cells
that
compose
its
wall
are
the
primary
germinal
layers
the
ectoderm
and
entoderm
this
embryonic
form
is
the
ontogenetic
reproduction
of
the
extremely
important
phylogenetic
of
all
the
metazoa
which
we
have
called
the
gastræa
as
the
human
embryo
passes
through
the
like
that
of
all
the
other
metazoa
we
can
trace
its
phylogenetic
origin
to
the
gastræa
as
we
continued
to
follow
the
embryonic
development
of
the
structure
we
saw
that
first
a
third
or
middle
layer
mesoderm
appears
between
the
two
primary
layers
when
this
divides
into
two
we
have
the
four
secondary
germinal
layers
these
have
just
the
same
composition
and
genetic
significance
in
man
as
in
all
the
other
vertebrates
from
the
layer
are
developed
the
epidermis
the
central
nervous
system
and
the
chief
part
of
the
the
layer
forms
the
corium
and
the
motor
skeleton
and
the
muscular
system
from
the
layer
are
developed
the
vascular
system
the
muscular
wall
of
the
gut
and
the
sexual
glands
finally
the
layer
only
forms
the
epithelium
or
the
inner
cellular
stratum
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
glands
lungs
liver
the
manner
in
which
these
different
systems
of
organs
arise
from
the
secondary
germinal
layers
is
essentially
the
same
from
the
start
in
man
as
in
all
the
other
vertebrates
we
saw
in
studying
the
embryonic
development
of
each
organ
that
the
human
embryo
follows
the
special
lines
of
differentiation
and
construction
that
are
only
found
otherwise
in
the
vertebrates
within
the
limits
of
this
vast
stem
we
have
followed
step
by
step
the
development
both
of
the
body
as
a
whole
and
of
its
various
parts
this
higher
development
follows
in
the
human
embryo
the
form
that
is
peculiar
to
the
mammals
finally
we
saw
that
even
within
the
limits
of
this
class
the
various
phylogenetic
stages
that
we
distinguish
in
a
natural
classification
of
the
mammals
correspond
to
the
ontogenetic
stages
that
the
human
embryo
passes
through
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
we
were
thus
in
a
position
to
determine
precisely
the
position
of
man
in
this
class
and
so
to
establish
his
relationship
to
the
different
orders
of
mammals
the
line
of
argument
we
followed
in
this
explanation
of
the
ontogenetic
facts
was
simply
a
consistent
application
of
the
biogenetic
law
in
this
we
have
throughout
taken
strict
account
of
the
distinction
between
palingenetic
and
cenogenetic
phenomena
palingenesis
or
alone
enables
us
to
draw
conclusions
from
the
observed
embryonic
form
to
the
preserved
by
heredity
such
inference
becomes
more
or
less
precarious
when
there
has
been
cenogenesis
or
disturbance
of
development
owing
to
fresh
adaptations
we
can
not
understand
embryonic
development
unless
we
appreciate
this
very
important
distinction
here
we
stand
at
the
very
limit
that
separates
the
older
and
the
new
science
or
philosophy
of
nature
the
whole
of
the
results
of
recent
morphological
research
compel
us
irresistibly
to
recognise
the
biogenetic
law
and
its
consequences
these
are
it
is
true
irreconcilable
with
the
legends
and
doctrines
of
former
days
that
have
been
impressed
on
us
by
religious
education
but
without
the
law
without
the
distinction
between
and
and
without
the
theory
of
on
which
we
base
it
it
is
quite
impossible
to
understand
the
facts
of
organic
development
without
them
we
can
not
cast
the
faintest
gleam
of
explanation
over
this
marvellous
field
of
phenomena
but
when
we
recognise
the
causal
correlation
of
ontogeny
and
phylogeny
expressed
in
this
law
the
wonderful
facts
of
embryology
are
susceptible
of
a
very
simple
explanation
they
are
found
to
be
the
necessary
mechanical
effects
of
the
evolution
of
the
stem
determined
by
the
laws
of
heredity
and
adaptation
the
correlative
action
of
these
laws
under
the
universal
influence
of
the
struggle
for
existence
we
may
say
in
a
word
with
selection
is
entirely
adequate
to
explain
the
whole
process
of
embryology
in
the
light
of
phylogeny
it
is
the
chief
merit
of
darwin
that
he
explained
by
his
theory
of
selection
the
correlation
of
the
laws
of
heredity
and
adaptation
that
lamarck
had
recognised
and
pointed
out
the
true
way
to
reach
a
causal
interpretation
of
evolution
the
phenomenon
that
it
is
most
imperative
to
recognise
in
this
connection
is
the
inheritance
of
functional
variations
jean
lamarck
was
the
first
to
appreciate
its
fundamental
importance
in
and
we
may
therefore
justly
give
the
name
of
lamarckism
to
the
theory
of
descent
he
based
on
it
hence
the
radical
opponents
of
the
latter
have
very
properly
directed
their
attacks
chiefly
against
the
former
one
of
the
most
distinguished
and
most
of
these
opponents
wilhelm
his
affirms
very
positively
that
acquired
in
the
life
of
the
individual
are
not
the
inheritance
of
acquired
characters
is
denied
not
only
by
thorough
opponents
of
evolution
but
even
by
scientists
who
admit
it
and
have
contributed
a
good
deal
to
its
establishment
especially
weismann
galton
ray
lankester
etc
since
the
chief
opponent
has
been
august
weismann
who
has
rendered
the
greatest
service
in
the
development
of
theory
of
selection
in
his
work
on
continuity
of
the
and
in
his
recent
excellent
on
the
theory
of
he
has
with
great
success
advanced
the
opinion
that
those
characters
can
be
transmitted
to
subsequent
generations
that
were
contained
in
rudimentary
form
in
the
however
this
theory
with
its
attempt
to
explain
heredity
is
merely
a
molecular
it
is
one
of
those
metaphysical
speculations
that
attribute
the
evolutionary
phenomena
exclusively
to
internal
causes
and
regard
the
influence
of
the
environment
as
insignificant
herbert
spencer
theodor
eimer
lester
ward
hering
and
zehnder
have
pointed
out
the
untenable
consequences
of
this
position
i
have
given
my
view
of
it
in
the
tenth
edition
of
the
of
pp
i
hold
with
lamarck
and
darwin
that
the
hereditary
transmission
of
acquired
characters
is
one
of
the
most
important
phenomena
in
biology
and
is
proved
by
thousands
of
morphological
and
physiological
experiences
it
is
an
indispensable
foundation
of
the
theory
of
evolution
of
the
many
and
weighty
arguments
for
the
truth
of
this
conception
of
evolution
i
will
for
the
moment
merely
point
to
the
invaluable
evidence
of
dysteleology
the
science
of
rudimentary
organs
we
can
not
insist
too
often
or
too
strongly
on
the
great
morphological
significance
of
these
remarkable
organs
which
are
completely
useless
from
the
physiological
point
of
view
we
find
some
of
these
useless
parts
inherited
from
our
lower
vertebrate
ancestors
in
every
system
of
organs
in
man
and
the
higher
vertebrates
thus
we
find
at
once
on
the
skin
a
scanty
and
rudimentary
coat
of
hair
only
fully
developed
on
the
head
under
the
shoulders
and
at
a
few
other
parts
of
the
body
the
short
hairs
on
the
greater
part
of
the
body
are
quite
useless
and
devoid
of
physiological
value
they
are
the
last
relic
of
the
thicker
hairy
coat
of
our
simian
ancestors
the
sensory
apparatus
presents
a
series
of
most
remarkable
rudimentary
organs
we
have
seen
that
the
whole
of
the
shell
of
the
external
ear
with
its
cartilages
muscles
and
skin
is
in
man
a
useless
appendage
and
has
not
the
physiological
importance
that
was
formerly
ascribed
to
it
it
is
the
degenerate
remainder
of
the
pointed
freely
moving
and
more
advanced
mammal
ear
the
muscles
of
which
we
still
have
but
can
not
work
them
we
found
at
the
inner
corner
of
our
eye
a
small
curious
fold
that
is
of
no
use
whatever
to
us
and
is
only
interesting
as
the
last
relic
of
the
nictitating
membrane
the
third
inner
that
had
a
distinct
physiological
purpose
in
the
ancient
sharks
and
still
has
in
many
of
the
amniotes
the
motor
apparatus
in
both
the
skeleton
and
muscular
systems
provides
a
number
of
interesting
dysteleological
arguments
i
need
only
recall
the
projecting
tail
of
the
human
embryo
with
its
rudimentary
caudal
vertebræ
and
muscles
this
is
totally
useless
in
man
but
very
interesting
as
the
degenerate
relic
of
the
long
tail
of
our
simian
ancestors
from
these
we
have
also
inherited
various
bony
processes
and
muscles
which
were
very
useful
to
them
in
climbing
trees
but
are
useless
to
us
at
various
points
of
the
skin
we
have
cutaneous
muscles
which
we
never
of
a
cutaneous
muscle
in
our
lower
mammal
ancestors
this
had
the
function
of
contracting
and
creasing
the
skin
to
chase
away
the
flies
as
we
see
every
day
in
the
horse
another
relic
in
us
of
this
large
cutaneous
muscle
is
the
frontal
muscle
by
which
we
knit
our
forehead
and
raise
our
but
there
is
another
considerable
relic
of
it
the
large
cutaneous
muscle
in
the
neck
over
which
we
have
no
voluntary
control
not
only
in
the
systems
of
animal
organs
but
also
in
the
vegetal
apparatus
we
find
a
number
of
rudimentary
organs
many
of
which
we
have
already
noticed
in
the
alimentary
apparatus
there
are
the
and
the
thyroid
gland
the
seat
of
goitre
and
the
relic
of
a
ciliated
groove
that
the
tunicates
and
acrania
still
have
in
the
there
is
also
the
vermiform
appendix
to
the
cæcum
in
the
vascular
system
we
have
a
number
of
useless
cords
which
represent
relics
of
atrophied
vessels
that
were
once
active
as
between
the
pulmonary
artery
and
the
aorta
the
venosus
between
the
portal
vein
and
the
vena
cava
and
many
others
the
many
rudimentary
organs
in
the
urinary
and
sexual
apparatus
are
particularly
interesting
these
are
generally
developed
in
one
sex
and
rudimentary
in
the
other
thus
the
spermaducts
are
formed
from
the
wolffian
ducts
in
the
male
whereas
in
the
female
we
have
merely
rudimentary
traces
of
them
in
canals
on
the
other
hand
in
the
female
the
oviducts
and
womb
are
developed
from
the
mullerian
ducts
while
in
the
male
only
the
lowest
ends
of
them
remain
as
the
again
the
male
has
in
his
nipples
and
mammary
glands
the
rudiments
of
organs
that
are
usually
active
only
in
the
female
a
careful
anatomic
study
of
the
human
frame
would
disclose
to
us
numbers
of
other
rudimentary
organs
and
these
can
only
be
explained
on
the
theory
of
evolution
robert
wiedersheim
has
collected
a
large
number
of
them
in
his
work
on
human
frame
as
a
witness
to
its
they
are
some
of
the
weightiest
proofs
of
the
truth
of
the
mechanical
conception
and
the
strongest
disproofs
of
the
teleological
view
if
as
the
latter
demands
man
or
any
other
organism
had
been
designed
and
fitted
for
his
from
the
start
and
brought
into
being
by
a
creative
act
the
existence
of
these
rudimentary
organs
would
be
an
insoluble
enigma
it
would
be
impossible
to
understand
why
the
creator
had
put
this
useless
burden
on
his
creatures
to
walk
a
path
that
is
in
itself
by
no
means
easy
but
the
theory
of
evolution
gives
the
simplest
possible
explanation
of
them
it
says
the
rudimentary
organs
are
parts
of
the
body
that
have
fallen
into
disuse
in
the
course
of
centuries
they
had
definite
functions
in
our
animal
ancestors
but
have
lost
their
physiological
significance
on
account
of
fresh
adaptations
they
have
become
superfluous
but
are
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
by
heredity
and
gradually
atrophy
we
have
inherited
not
only
these
rudimentary
parts
but
all
the
organs
of
our
body
from
the
from
the
apes
the
human
body
does
not
contain
a
single
organ
that
has
not
been
inherited
from
the
apes
in
fact
with
the
aid
of
our
biogenetic
law
we
can
trace
the
origin
of
our
various
systems
of
organs
much
further
down
to
the
lowest
stages
of
our
ancestry
we
can
say
for
instance
that
we
have
inherited
the
oldest
organs
of
the
body
the
external
skin
and
the
internal
coat
of
the
alimentary
system
from
the
gastræads
the
nervous
and
muscular
systems
from
the
platodes
the
vascular
system
the
and
the
blood
from
the
vermalia
the
chorda
and
the
branchial
gut
from
the
prochordonia
the
articulation
of
the
body
from
the
acrania
the
primitive
skull
and
the
higher
from
the
cyclostomes
the
limbs
and
jaws
from
the
selachii
the
foot
from
the
amphibia
the
palate
from
the
reptiles
the
hairy
coat
the
mammary
glands
and
the
external
sexual
organs
from
the
when
we
formulated
law
of
the
ontogenetic
connection
of
systematically
related
forms
and
determined
the
relative
age
of
organs
we
saw
how
it
was
possible
to
draw
phylogenetic
conclusions
from
the
ontogenetic
succession
of
systems
of
organs
with
the
aid
of
this
important
law
and
of
comparative
anatomy
we
were
also
enabled
to
determine
place
in
nature
or
as
we
put
it
assign
to
man
his
position
in
the
classification
of
the
animal
kingdom
in
recent
zoological
classification
the
animal
world
is
divided
into
twelve
stems
or
phyla
and
these
are
broadly
into
about
sixty
classes
and
these
classes
into
at
least
orders
in
his
whole
organisation
man
is
most
certainly
in
the
first
place
a
member
of
one
of
these
stems
the
vertebrate
stem
secondly
a
member
of
one
particular
class
in
this
stem
the
mammals
and
thirdly
of
one
particular
order
the
order
of
primates
he
has
all
the
characteristics
that
distinguish
the
vertebrates
from
the
other
eleven
animal
stems
the
mammals
from
the
other
sixty
classes
and
the
primates
from
the
other
orders
of
the
animal
kingdom
we
may
turn
and
twist
as
we
like
but
we
can
not
get
over
this
fact
of
anatomy
and
classification
of
late
years
this
fact
has
given
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
discussion
and
especially
of
controversy
as
to
the
particular
anatomic
relationship
of
man
to
the
apes
the
most
curious
opinions
have
been
advanced
on
this
or
it
is
as
well
therefore
to
go
into
it
once
more
and
distinguish
the
essential
from
the
unessential
cf
pp
we
start
from
the
undisputed
fact
that
man
is
in
any
we
accept
or
reject
his
special
to
the
true
mammal
in
fact
a
placental
mammal
this
fundamental
fact
can
be
proved
so
easily
at
any
moment
from
comparative
anatomy
that
it
has
been
universally
admitted
since
the
separation
of
the
placentals
from
the
lower
mammals
marsupials
and
monotremes
but
for
every
consistent
subscriber
to
the
theory
of
evolution
it
must
follow
at
once
that
man
descends
from
a
common
with
all
the
other
placentals
the
of
the
placentals
just
as
we
must
admit
a
common
mesozoic
ancestor
of
all
the
mammals
this
is
however
to
settle
decisively
the
great
and
burning
question
of
place
in
nature
whether
or
no
we
go
on
to
admit
a
nearer
or
more
distant
relationship
to
the
apes
whether
man
is
or
is
not
a
member
of
the
or
if
you
prefer
the
in
the
phylogenetic
sense
in
any
case
his
direct
to
the
rest
of
the
mammals
and
especially
the
placentals
is
established
it
is
possible
that
the
affinities
of
the
various
orders
of
mammals
to
each
other
are
different
from
what
we
hypothetically
assume
but
in
any
case
the
common
descent
of
man
and
all
the
other
mammals
from
one
is
beyond
question
this
promammal
was
probably
evolved
from
proreptiles
during
the
triassic
period
and
must
certainly
be
regarded
as
the
monotreme
and
oviparous
ancestor
of
the
mammals
if
we
hold
firmly
to
this
fundamental
and
most
important
thesis
we
shall
see
the
in
a
very
different
light
from
that
in
which
it
is
usually
regarded
little
reflection
is
then
needed
to
see
that
it
is
not
nearly
so
important
as
it
is
said
to
be
the
origin
of
the
human
race
from
a
series
of
mammal
ancestors
and
the
historic
evolution
of
these
from
an
earlier
series
of
lower
vertebrate
ancestors
together
with
all
the
weighty
conclusions
that
every
thoughtful
man
deduces
therefrom
remain
untouched
so
far
as
these
are
concerned
it
is
immaterial
whether
we
regard
true
as
our
nearest
ancestors
or
not
but
as
it
has
become
the
fashion
to
lay
the
chief
stress
in
the
whole
question
of
origin
on
the
from
the
apes
i
am
compelled
to
return
to
it
once
more
and
recall
the
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
that
give
a
decisive
answer
to
this
the
shortest
way
to
attain
our
purpose
is
that
followed
by
huxley
in
in
his
able
work
which
i
have
already
often
quoted
place
in
way
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
we
have
to
compare
impartially
all
organs
with
the
same
organs
in
the
higher
apes
and
then
to
examine
if
the
differences
between
the
two
are
greater
than
the
corresponding
differences
between
the
higher
and
the
lower
apes
the
indubitable
and
incontestable
result
of
this
study
conducted
with
the
greatest
care
and
impartiality
was
the
which
we
have
called
the
huxleian
law
in
honour
of
its
that
the
differences
in
organisation
between
man
and
the
most
advanced
apes
we
know
are
much
slighter
than
the
corresponding
differences
in
organisation
between
the
higher
and
lower
apes
we
may
even
give
a
more
precise
formula
to
this
law
by
excluding
the
platyrrhines
or
american
apes
as
distant
relatives
and
restricting
the
comparison
to
the
narrower
of
the
catarrhines
the
apes
of
the
old
world
within
the
limits
of
this
small
group
of
mammals
we
found
the
structural
differences
between
the
lower
and
higher
catarrhine
instance
the
baboon
and
the
be
much
greater
than
the
differences
between
the
anthropoid
apes
and
man
if
we
now
turn
to
ontogeny
and
find
according
to
our
of
the
ontogenetic
connection
of
systematically
related
forms
that
the
embryos
of
the
anthropoid
apes
and
man
retain
their
resemblance
for
a
longer
time
than
the
embryos
of
the
highest
and
the
lowest
apes
we
are
forced
whether
we
like
it
or
no
to
recognise
our
descent
from
the
order
of
apes
we
can
assuredly
construct
an
approximate
picture
in
the
imagination
of
the
form
of
our
early
tertiary
ancestors
from
the
foregoing
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
however
we
may
frame
this
in
detail
it
will
be
the
picture
of
a
true
ape
and
a
distinct
catarrhine
ape
this
has
been
shown
so
well
by
huxley
that
the
recent
attacks
of
klaatsch
virchow
and
other
anthropologists
have
completely
failed
cf
all
the
structural
characters
that
distinguish
the
catarrhines
from
the
platyrrhines
are
found
in
man
hence
in
the
genealogy
of
the
mammals
we
must
derive
man
immediately
from
the
catarrhine
group
and
locate
the
origin
of
the
human
race
in
the
old
world
only
the
early
from
which
both
descended
was
common
to
them
it
is
therefore
established
beyond
question
for
all
impartial
scientific
inquiry
that
the
human
race
comes
directly
from
the
apes
of
the
old
world
but
at
the
same
time
i
repeat
that
this
is
not
so
important
in
connection
with
the
main
question
of
the
origin
of
man
as
is
commonly
supposed
even
if
we
entirely
ignore
it
all
that
we
have
learned
from
the
zoological
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
as
to
the
placental
character
of
man
remains
untouched
these
prove
beyond
all
doubt
the
common
descent
of
man
and
all
the
rest
of
the
mammals
further
the
main
question
is
not
in
the
least
affected
if
it
is
said
is
true
that
man
is
a
mammal
but
he
has
diverged
at
the
very
root
of
the
class
from
all
the
other
mammals
and
has
no
closer
relationship
to
any
living
group
of
the
affinity
is
more
or
less
close
in
any
case
if
we
examine
the
relation
of
the
mammal
class
to
the
sixty
other
classes
of
the
animal
world
quite
certainly
the
whole
of
the
mammals
including
man
have
had
a
common
origin
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
their
common
were
gradually
evolved
from
a
long
series
of
lower
vertebrates
the
resistance
to
the
theory
of
a
descent
from
the
apes
is
clearly
due
in
most
men
to
feeling
rather
than
to
reason
they
shrink
from
the
notion
of
such
an
origin
just
because
they
see
in
the
ape
organism
a
caricature
of
man
a
distorted
and
unattractive
image
of
themselves
because
it
hurts
æsthetic
complacency
and
it
is
more
flattering
to
think
we
have
descended
from
some
lofty
and
being
and
so
from
the
earliest
times
human
vanity
has
been
pleased
to
believe
in
our
origin
from
gods
or
the
church
with
that
sophistic
reversal
of
ideas
of
which
it
is
a
master
has
succeeded
in
representing
this
ridiculous
piece
of
vanity
as
and
the
very
men
who
reject
with
horror
the
notion
of
an
animal
origin
and
count
themselves
of
god
love
to
prate
of
their
sense
of
in
most
of
the
sermons
that
have
poured
out
from
pulpit
and
altar
against
the
doctrine
of
evolution
human
vanity
and
conceit
have
been
a
conspicuous
element
and
although
we
have
inherited
this
very
characteristic
weakness
from
the
apes
we
must
admit
that
we
have
developed
it
to
a
higher
degree
which
is
entirely
repudiated
by
sound
and
normal
intelligence
we
are
greatly
amused
at
all
the
childish
follies
that
the
ridiculous
pride
of
ancestry
has
maintained
from
the
middle
ages
to
our
own
time
yet
there
is
a
large
amount
of
this
empty
feeling
in
most
men
just
as
most
people
much
prefer
to
trace
their
family
back
to
some
degenerate
baron
or
some
famous
prince
rather
than
to
an
unknown
peasant
so
most
men
would
rather
have
as
parent
of
the
race
a
sinful
and
fallen
adam
than
an
advancing
and
vigorous
ape
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
to
that
extent
we
can
not
quarrel
over
these
genealogical
tendencies
personally
the
notion
of
ascent
is
more
congenial
to
me
than
that
of
descent
it
seems
to
me
a
finer
thing
to
be
the
advanced
offspring
of
a
simian
ancestor
that
has
developed
progressively
from
the
lower
mammals
in
the
struggle
for
life
than
the
degenerate
descendant
of
a
being
made
from
a
clod
and
fallen
for
his
sins
and
an
eve
created
from
one
of
his
ribs
speaking
of
the
rib
i
may
add
to
what
i
have
said
about
the
development
of
the
skeleton
that
the
number
of
ribs
is
just
the
same
in
man
and
woman
in
both
of
them
the
ribs
are
formed
from
the
middle
germinal
layer
and
are
from
the
phylogenetic
point
of
view
lower
or
ventral
vertebral
arches
but
it
is
said
is
all
very
well
as
far
as
the
human
body
is
concerned
on
the
facts
quoted
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
it
has
really
and
gradually
been
evolved
from
the
long
ancestral
series
of
the
vertebrates
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
as
regards
mind
or
soul
this
can
not
possibly
have
been
developed
from
the
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
meet
this
grave
stricture
from
the
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
physiology
and
embryology
it
will
be
best
to
begin
with
a
comparative
study
of
the
souls
of
various
groups
of
vertebrates
here
we
find
such
an
enormous
variety
of
vertebrate
souls
that
at
first
sight
it
seems
quite
impossible
to
trace
them
all
to
a
common
think
of
the
tiny
amphioxus
with
no
real
brain
but
a
simple
medullary
tube
and
its
whole
psychic
life
at
the
very
lowest
stage
among
the
vertebrates
the
following
group
of
the
cyclostomes
are
still
very
limited
though
they
have
a
brain
when
we
pass
on
to
the
fishes
we
find
their
intelligence
remaining
at
a
very
low
level
we
do
not
see
any
material
advance
in
mental
development
until
we
go
on
to
the
amphibia
and
reptiles
there
is
still
greater
advance
when
we
come
to
the
mammals
though
even
here
the
minds
of
the
monotremes
and
of
the
stupid
marsupials
remain
at
a
low
stage
but
when
we
rise
from
these
to
the
placentals
we
find
within
this
one
vast
group
such
a
number
of
important
stages
of
differentiation
and
progress
that
the
psychic
differences
between
the
least
intelligent
such
as
the
sloths
and
armadillos
and
the
most
intelligent
placentals
such
as
the
dogs
and
apes
are
much
greater
than
the
psychic
differences
between
the
lowest
placentals
and
the
marsupials
or
monotremes
most
certainly
the
differences
are
far
greater
than
the
differences
in
mental
power
between
the
dog
the
ape
and
man
yet
all
these
animals
are
members
of
a
single
natural
class
the
english
reader
will
recognise
here
the
curious
position
of
wallace
and
of
the
late
we
see
this
to
a
still
more
astonishing
extent
in
the
comparative
psychology
of
another
class
of
animals
that
is
especially
interesting
for
many
insect
class
it
is
well
known
that
we
find
in
many
insects
a
degree
of
intelligence
that
is
found
in
man
alone
among
the
vertebrates
everybody
knows
of
the
famous
communities
and
states
of
bees
and
ants
and
of
the
very
remarkable
social
arrangements
in
them
such
as
we
find
among
the
more
advanced
races
of
men
but
among
no
other
group
of
animals
i
need
only
mention
the
social
organisation
and
government
of
the
monarchic
bees
and
the
republican
ants
and
their
division
into
different
workers
educators
soldiers
etc
one
of
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
in
this
very
interesting
province
is
the
of
the
ants
which
rear
as
and
regularly
extract
their
honeyed
juice
still
more
remarkable
is
the
of
the
large
red
ants
which
steal
the
young
of
the
small
black
ants
and
bring
them
up
as
slaves
it
has
long
been
known
that
these
political
and
social
arrangements
of
the
ants
are
due
to
the
deliberate
cooperation
of
the
countless
citizens
and
that
they
understand
each
other
a
number
of
recent
observers
especially
fritz
müller
sir
lubbock
lord
avebury
and
august
forel
have
put
the
astonishing
degree
of
intelligence
of
these
tiny
articulates
beyond
question
now
compare
with
these
the
mental
life
of
many
of
the
lower
especially
the
parasitic
insects
as
darwin
did
there
is
for
instance
the
cochineal
insect
which
in
its
adult
state
has
a
motionless
body
attached
to
the
leaves
of
plants
its
feet
are
atrophied
its
snout
is
sunk
in
the
tissue
of
the
plants
of
which
it
absorbs
the
sap
the
whole
psychic
life
of
these
inert
female
parasites
consists
in
the
pleasure
they
experience
from
sucking
the
sap
of
the
plant
and
in
sexual
intercourse
with
the
males
it
is
the
same
with
the
females
of
the
which
spend
their
lives
parasitically
and
immovably
without
wings
or
feet
in
the
abdomen
of
wasps
there
is
no
question
here
of
higher
psychic
action
if
we
compare
these
sluggish
parasites
with
the
intelligent
and
active
ants
we
must
admit
that
the
psychic
differences
between
them
are
much
greater
than
the
psychic
differences
between
the
lowest
and
highest
mammals
between
the
monotremes
marsupials
and
armadillos
on
the
one
hand
and
the
dog
ape
or
man
on
the
other
yet
all
these
insects
belong
to
the
same
class
of
articulates
just
as
all
the
mammals
belong
to
one
and
the
same
class
and
just
as
every
consistent
evolutionist
must
admit
a
common
for
all
these
insects
so
he
must
also
for
all
the
mammals
if
we
now
turn
from
the
comparative
study
of
psychic
life
in
different
animals
to
the
question
of
the
organs
of
this
function
we
receive
the
answer
that
in
all
the
higher
animals
they
are
always
bound
up
with
certain
groups
of
cells
the
ganglionic
cells
or
neurona
that
compose
the
nervous
system
all
scientists
without
exception
are
agreed
that
the
central
nervous
system
is
the
organ
of
psychic
life
in
the
animal
and
it
is
possible
to
prove
this
experimentally
at
any
moment
when
we
partially
or
wholly
destroy
the
central
nervous
system
we
extinguish
in
the
same
proportion
partially
or
wholly
the
or
psychic
activity
of
the
animal
we
have
therefore
to
examine
the
features
of
the
psychic
organ
in
man
the
reader
already
knows
the
incontestable
answer
to
this
question
psychic
organ
is
in
structure
and
origin
just
the
same
organ
as
in
all
the
other
vertebrates
it
originates
in
the
shape
of
a
simple
medullary
tube
from
the
outer
membrane
of
the
layer
the
simple
cerebral
vesicle
that
is
formed
by
the
expansion
of
the
of
this
medullary
tube
divides
by
transverse
constrictions
into
five
and
these
pass
through
more
or
less
the
same
stages
of
construction
in
the
human
embryo
as
in
the
rest
of
the
mammals
as
these
are
undoubtedly
of
a
common
origin
their
brain
and
spinal
cord
must
also
have
a
common
origin
physiology
teaches
us
further
on
the
ground
of
observation
and
experiment
that
the
relation
of
the
to
its
organ
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
is
just
the
same
in
man
as
in
the
other
mammals
the
one
can
not
act
at
all
without
the
other
it
is
just
as
much
bound
up
with
it
as
muscular
movement
is
with
the
muscles
it
can
only
develop
in
connection
with
it
if
we
are
evolutionists
at
all
and
grant
the
causal
connection
of
ontogenesis
and
phylogenesis
we
are
forced
to
admit
this
thesis
the
human
soul
or
psyche
as
a
function
of
the
medullary
tube
has
developed
along
with
it
and
just
as
brain
and
spinal
cord
now
develop
from
the
simple
medullary
tube
in
every
human
individual
so
the
human
mind
or
the
psychic
life
of
the
whole
human
race
has
been
gradually
evolved
from
the
lower
vertebrate
soul
just
as
the
intricate
structure
of
the
brain
proceeds
step
by
step
from
the
same
rudiment
in
every
human
same
five
cerebral
in
all
the
other
craniotes
so
the
human
soul
has
been
gradually
developed
in
the
course
of
millions
of
years
from
a
long
series
of
finally
just
as
in
every
human
embryo
the
various
parts
of
the
brain
differentiate
after
the
special
type
of
the
so
the
human
psyche
has
proceeded
historically
from
the
it
is
true
that
this
monistic
conception
is
rejected
with
horror
by
most
men
and
the
dualistic
idea
which
denies
the
inseparable
connection
of
brain
and
mind
and
regards
body
and
soul
as
two
totally
different
things
is
still
popular
but
how
can
we
reconcile
this
view
with
the
known
facts
of
evolution
it
meets
with
difficulties
equally
great
and
insuperable
in
embryology
and
in
phylogeny
if
we
suppose
with
the
majority
of
men
that
the
soul
is
an
independent
entity
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
body
originally
but
merely
inhabits
it
for
a
time
and
gives
expression
to
its
experiences
through
the
brain
just
as
the
pianist
does
through
his
instrument
we
must
assign
a
point
in
human
embryology
at
which
the
soul
enters
into
the
brain
and
at
death
again
we
must
assign
a
moment
at
which
it
abandons
the
body
as
further
each
human
individual
has
inherited
certain
personal
features
from
each
parent
we
must
suppose
that
in
the
act
of
conception
pieces
were
detached
from
their
souls
and
transferred
to
the
embryo
a
piece
of
the
paternal
soul
goes
spermatozoon
and
a
piece
of
the
soul
remains
in
the
ovum
at
the
moment
of
conception
when
portions
of
the
two
nuclei
of
the
copulating
cells
join
together
to
form
the
nucleus
of
the
the
accompanying
fragments
of
the
immaterial
souls
must
also
be
supposed
to
coalesce
on
this
dualistic
view
the
phenomena
of
psychic
development
are
totally
incomprehensible
everybody
knows
that
the
child
has
no
consciousness
no
knowledge
of
itself
and
the
surrounding
world
every
parent
who
has
impartially
followed
the
mental
development
of
his
children
will
find
it
impossible
to
deny
that
it
is
a
case
of
biological
evolutionary
processes
just
as
all
other
functions
of
the
body
develop
in
connection
with
their
organs
so
the
soul
does
in
connection
with
the
brain
this
gradual
unfolding
of
the
soul
of
the
child
is
in
fact
so
wonderful
and
glorious
a
phenomenon
that
every
mother
or
father
who
has
eyes
to
observe
is
never
tired
of
contemplating
it
it
is
only
our
manuals
of
psychology
that
know
nothing
of
this
development
we
are
almost
tempted
to
think
sometimes
that
their
authors
can
never
have
had
children
themselves
the
human
soul
as
described
in
most
of
our
psychological
works
is
merely
the
soul
of
a
learned
philosopher
who
has
read
a
good
many
books
but
knows
nothing
of
evolution
and
never
even
reflects
that
his
own
soul
has
had
a
development
when
these
dualistic
philosophers
are
consistent
they
must
assign
a
moment
in
the
phylogeny
of
the
human
soul
at
which
it
was
first
into
vertebrate
body
hence
at
the
time
when
the
human
body
was
evolved
from
the
anthropoid
body
of
the
ape
probably
in
the
tertiary
period
a
specific
human
psychic
as
people
love
to
say
spark
of
have
been
suddenly
infused
or
breathed
into
the
anthropoid
brain
and
been
associated
with
the
already
present
in
it
i
need
not
insist
on
the
enormous
theoretical
difficulties
of
this
idea
i
will
only
point
out
that
this
of
divinity
which
is
supposed
to
distinguish
the
soul
of
man
from
that
of
the
other
animals
must
be
itself
capable
of
development
and
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
progressively
developed
in
the
course
of
human
history
as
a
rule
reason
is
taken
to
be
this
of
divinity
and
is
supposed
to
be
an
exclusive
possession
of
humanity
but
comparative
psychology
shows
us
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
set
up
this
barrier
between
man
and
the
brute
either
we
take
the
word
in
the
wider
sense
and
then
it
is
found
in
the
higher
mammals
ape
dog
elephant
horse
just
as
well
as
in
most
men
or
else
in
the
narrower
sense
and
then
it
is
lacking
in
most
men
just
as
much
as
in
the
majority
of
animals
on
the
whole
we
may
still
say
of
reason
what
mephistopheles
said
life
somewhat
better
might
content
him
but
for
the
gleam
of
heavenly
light
that
thou
hast
given
him
he
calls
it
reason
thence
his
increased
to
be
still
beastlier
than
any
beast
if
then
we
must
reject
these
popular
and
in
some
respects
agreeable
dualistic
theories
as
untenable
because
inconsistent
with
the
genetic
facts
there
remains
only
the
opposite
or
monistic
conception
according
to
which
the
human
soul
is
like
any
other
animal
soul
a
function
of
the
central
nervous
system
and
develops
in
inseparable
connection
therewith
we
see
this
in
every
child
the
biogenetic
law
compels
us
to
affirm
it
just
as
in
every
human
embryo
the
layer
gives
rise
to
the
medullary
tube
from
the
anterior
end
of
which
the
five
cerebral
vesicles
of
the
craniotes
are
developed
and
from
these
the
mammal
brain
first
with
the
characters
of
the
lower
then
with
those
of
the
higher
mammals
and
as
the
whole
of
this
ontogenetic
process
is
only
a
brief
hereditary
reproduction
of
the
same
process
in
the
phylogenesis
of
the
vertebrates
so
the
wonderful
spiritual
life
of
the
human
race
through
many
thousands
of
years
has
been
evolved
step
by
step
from
the
lowly
psychic
life
of
the
lower
vertebrates
and
the
development
of
every
is
only
a
brief
repetition
of
that
long
and
complex
phylogenetic
process
from
all
these
facts
sound
reason
must
conclude
that
the
still
prevalent
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
an
untenable
superstition
i
have
shown
its
inconsistency
with
modern
science
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
riddle
of
the
here
it
may
also
be
well
to
point
out
the
great
importance
of
anthropogeny
in
the
light
of
the
biogenetic
law
for
the
purposes
of
philosophy
the
speculative
philosophers
who
take
cognizance
of
these
ontogenetic
facts
and
explain
them
in
accordance
with
the
law
phylogenetically
will
advance
the
great
questions
of
philosophy
far
more
than
the
most
distinguished
thinkers
of
all
ages
have
yet
succeeded
in
doing
most
certainly
every
clear
and
consistent
thinker
must
derive
from
the
facts
of
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
we
have
adduced
a
number
of
suggestive
ideas
that
can
not
fail
to
have
an
influence
on
the
progress
of
philosophy
nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
the
candid
statement
and
impartial
appreciation
of
these
facts
will
lead
to
the
decisive
triumph
of
the
philosophic
tendency
that
we
call
or
as
opposed
to
the
or
on
which
most
of
the
ancient
medieval
and
modern
systems
of
philosophy
are
based
the
monistic
or
mechanical
philosophy
affirms
that
all
the
phenomena
of
human
life
and
of
the
rest
of
nature
are
ruled
by
fixed
and
unalterable
laws
that
there
is
everywhere
a
necessary
causal
connection
of
phenomena
and
that
therefore
the
whole
knowable
universe
is
a
harmonious
unity
a
it
says
further
that
all
phenomena
are
due
solely
to
mechanical
or
efficient
causes
not
to
final
causes
it
does
not
admit
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
in
the
light
of
the
monistic
philosophy
the
phenomena
that
we
are
wont
to
regard
as
the
freest
and
most
independent
the
expressions
of
the
human
will
are
subject
just
as
much
to
rigid
laws
as
any
other
natural
phenomenon
as
a
matter
of
fact
impartial
and
thorough
examination
of
our
volitions
shows
that
they
are
never
really
free
but
always
determined
by
antecedent
factors
that
can
be
traced
to
either
heredity
or
adaptation
we
can
not
therefore
admit
the
conventional
distinction
between
nature
and
spirit
there
is
spirit
everywhere
in
nature
and
we
know
of
no
spirit
outside
of
nature
hence
also
the
common
antithesis
of
natural
science
and
mental
or
moral
science
is
untenable
every
science
as
such
is
both
natural
and
mental
that
is
a
firm
principle
of
monism
which
on
its
religious
side
we
may
also
denominate
pantheism
man
is
not
above
but
in
nature
it
is
true
that
the
opponents
of
evolution
love
to
misrepresent
the
monistic
philosophy
based
on
it
as
and
confuse
the
philosophic
tendency
of
this
name
with
a
wholly
unconnected
and
despicable
moral
materialism
strictly
speaking
it
would
be
just
as
proper
to
call
our
system
spiritualism
as
materialism
the
real
materialistic
philosophy
affirms
that
the
phenomena
of
life
are
like
all
other
phenomena
effects
or
products
of
matter
the
opposite
extreme
the
spiritualistic
philosophy
says
on
the
contrary
that
matter
is
a
product
of
energy
and
that
all
material
forms
are
produced
by
free
and
independent
forces
thus
according
to
materialism
the
matter
is
antecedent
to
the
living
force
according
to
the
equally
view
of
the
spiritist
it
is
the
reverse
both
views
are
dualistic
and
in
my
opinion
both
are
false
for
us
the
antithesis
disappears
in
the
monistic
philosophy
which
knows
neither
matter
without
force
nor
force
without
matter
it
is
only
necessary
to
reflect
for
some
time
over
the
question
from
the
strictly
scientific
point
of
view
to
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
form
a
clear
idea
of
either
hypothesis
as
goethe
said
can
never
exist
or
act
without
spirit
nor
spirit
without
the
human
or
is
merely
a
force
or
form
of
energy
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
material
of
the
body
the
thinking
force
of
the
mind
is
just
as
much
connected
with
the
structural
elements
of
the
brain
as
the
motor
force
of
the
muscles
with
their
structural
elements
our
mental
powers
are
functions
of
the
brain
as
much
as
any
other
force
is
a
function
of
a
material
body
we
know
of
no
matter
that
is
devoid
of
force
and
no
forces
that
are
not
bound
up
with
matter
when
the
forces
enter
into
the
phenomenon
as
movements
we
call
them
living
or
active
forces
when
they
are
in
a
state
of
rest
or
equilibrium
we
call
them
latent
or
potential
this
applies
equally
to
inorganic
and
organic
bodies
the
magnet
that
attracts
iron
filings
the
powder
that
explodes
the
steam
that
drives
the
locomotive
are
living
inorganics
they
act
by
living
force
as
much
as
the
sensitive
mimosa
does
when
it
contracts
its
leaves
at
touch
or
the
venerable
amphioxus
that
buries
itself
in
the
sand
of
the
sea
or
man
when
he
thinks
only
in
the
latter
cases
the
combinations
of
the
different
forces
that
appear
as
in
the
phenomenon
are
much
more
intricate
and
difficult
to
analyse
than
in
the
former
our
study
has
led
us
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
whole
evolution
of
man
in
his
embryology
and
in
his
phylogeny
there
are
no
living
forces
at
work
other
than
those
of
the
rest
of
organic
and
inorganic
nature
all
the
forces
that
are
operative
in
it
could
be
reduced
in
the
ultimate
analysis
to
growth
the
fundamental
evolutionary
function
that
brings
about
the
forms
of
both
the
organic
and
the
inorganic
but
growth
itself
depends
on
the
attraction
and
repulsion
of
homogeneous
and
heterogeneous
particles
years
ago
carl
ernst
von
baer
summed
up
the
general
result
of
his
classic
studies
of
animal
development
in
the
sentence
evolution
of
the
individual
is
the
history
of
the
growth
of
individuality
in
every
and
if
we
go
deeper
to
the
root
of
this
law
of
growth
we
find
that
in
the
long
run
it
can
always
be
reduced
to
that
attraction
and
repulsion
of
animated
atoms
which
empedocles
called
the
and
of
the
elements
thus
the
evolution
of
man
is
directed
by
the
same
iron
as
the
development
of
any
other
body
these
laws
always
lead
us
back
to
the
same
simple
principles
the
elementary
principles
of
physics
and
chemistry
the
various
phenomena
of
nature
only
differ
in
the
degree
of
complexity
in
which
the
different
forces
work
together
each
single
process
of
adaptation
and
heredity
in
the
of
our
ancestors
is
in
itself
a
very
complex
physiological
phenomenon
far
more
intricate
are
the
processes
of
human
embryology
in
these
are
condensed
and
comprised
thousands
of
the
phylogenetic
processes
in
my
morphology
which
appeared
in
i
made
the
first
attempt
to
apply
the
theory
of
evolution
as
reformed
by
darwin
to
the
whole
province
of
biology
and
especially
to
provide
with
its
assistance
a
mechanical
foundation
for
the
science
of
organic
forms
the
intimate
relations
that
exist
between
all
parts
of
organic
science
especially
the
direct
causal
nexus
between
the
two
sections
of
and
explained
in
that
work
for
the
first
time
by
transformism
and
were
interpreted
philosophically
in
the
light
of
the
theory
of
descent
the
anthropological
part
of
the
book
vii
contains
the
first
attempt
to
determine
the
series
of
ancestors
vol
ii
however
imperfect
this
attempt
was
it
provided
a
for
further
investigation
in
the
years
that
have
since
elapsed
the
biological
horizon
has
been
enormously
widened
our
empirical
acquisitions
in
paleontology
comparative
anatomy
and
ontogeny
have
grown
to
an
astonishing
extent
thanks
to
the
united
efforts
of
a
number
of
able
workers
and
the
employment
of
better
methods
many
important
biological
questions
that
then
appeared
to
be
obscure
enigmas
seem
to
be
entirely
settled
darwinism
arose
like
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
of
clear
monistic
science
after
the
dark
night
of
mystic
dogmatism
and
we
can
say
now
proudly
and
gladly
that
there
is
daylight
in
our
field
of
inquiry
philosophers
and
others
who
are
equally
ignorant
of
the
empirical
sources
of
our
evidence
and
the
phylogenetic
methods
of
utilising
it
have
even
lately
claimed
that
in
the
matter
of
constructing
our
genealogical
tree
nothing
more
has
been
done
than
the
discovery
of
a
of
ancestors
such
as
we
find
in
the
mansions
of
the
nobility
this
would
be
quite
true
if
the
genealogy
given
in
the
second
part
of
this
work
were
merely
the
juxtaposition
of
a
series
of
animal
forms
of
which
we
gathered
the
genetic
connection
from
their
external
physiognomic
resemblances
as
we
have
sufficiently
proved
already
it
is
for
us
a
question
of
a
totally
different
the
morphological
and
historical
proof
of
the
phylogenetic
connection
of
these
ancestors
on
the
basis
of
their
identity
in
internal
structure
and
embryonic
development
and
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
shown
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
how
far
this
is
calculated
to
reveal
to
us
their
inner
nature
and
its
historical
development
i
see
the
essence
of
its
significance
precisely
in
the
proof
of
historical
connection
i
am
one
of
those
scientists
who
believe
in
a
real
history
and
who
think
as
much
of
an
historical
knowledge
of
the
past
as
of
an
exact
investigation
of
the
present
the
incalculable
value
of
the
historical
consciousness
can
not
be
sufficiently
emphasised
at
a
time
when
historical
research
is
ignored
and
neglected
and
when
an
school
as
dogmatic
as
it
is
narrow
would
substitute
for
it
physical
experiments
and
mathematical
formulæ
historical
knowledge
can
not
be
replaced
by
any
other
branch
of
science
it
is
clear
that
the
prejudices
that
stand
in
the
way
of
a
general
recognition
of
this
are
still
very
great
otherwise
the
long
struggle
of
philosophic
systems
would
have
ended
in
favour
of
monism
but
we
may
confidently
expect
that
a
more
general
acquaintance
with
the
genetic
facts
will
gradually
destroy
these
prejudices
and
lead
to
the
triumph
of
the
natural
conception
of
place
in
when
we
hear
it
said
in
face
of
this
expectation
that
this
would
lead
to
retrogression
in
the
intellectual
and
moral
development
of
mankind
i
can
not
refrain
from
saying
that
in
my
opinion
it
will
be
just
the
reverse
that
it
will
promote
to
an
enormous
extent
the
advance
of
the
human
mind
all
progress
in
our
knowledge
of
truth
means
an
advance
in
the
higher
cultivation
of
the
human
intelligence
and
all
progress
in
its
application
to
practical
life
implies
a
corresponding
improvement
of
morality
the
worst
enemies
of
the
human
and
only
be
vanquished
by
truth
and
reason
in
any
case
i
hope
and
desire
to
have
convinced
the
reader
of
these
chapters
that
the
true
scientific
comprehension
of
the
human
frame
can
only
be
attained
in
the
way
that
we
recognise
to
be
the
