autobiography
of
sir
george
biddell
airy
honorary
fellow
of
trinity
college
cambridge
astronomer
royal
from
to
edited
by
wilfrid
airy
preface
the
life
of
airy
was
essentially
that
of
a
business
man
and
differed
from
that
of
other
people
only
in
the
quality
and
variety
of
his
work
it
was
not
an
exciting
life
but
it
was
full
of
interest
and
his
work
brought
him
into
close
relations
with
many
scientific
men
and
with
many
men
high
in
the
state
his
real
business
life
commenced
after
he
became
astronomer
royal
and
from
that
time
forward
during
the
years
that
he
remained
in
office
he
was
so
entirely
wrapped
up
in
the
duties
of
his
post
that
the
history
of
the
observatory
is
the
history
of
his
life
for
writing
his
business
life
there
is
abundant
material
for
he
preserved
all
his
correspondence
and
the
chief
sources
of
information
are
as
follows
his
autobiography
his
annual
reports
to
the
board
of
visitors
his
printed
papers
entitled
papers
by
airy
his
miscellaneous
private
correspondence
his
letters
to
his
wife
his
business
correspondence
his
autobiography
after
the
time
that
he
became
astronomer
royal
is
as
might
be
expected
mainly
a
record
of
the
scientific
work
carried
on
at
the
greenwich
observatory
but
by
no
means
exclusively
so
about
the
time
when
he
took
charge
of
the
observatory
there
was
an
immense
development
of
astronomical
enterprise
observatories
were
springing
up
in
all
directions
and
the
astronomer
royal
was
expected
to
advise
upon
all
of
the
british
and
colonial
observatories
it
was
necessary
also
for
him
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
continental
observatories
and
their
work
and
this
he
did
very
diligently
and
successfully
both
by
correspondence
and
personal
intercourse
with
the
foreign
astronomers
there
was
also
much
work
on
important
subjects
more
or
less
connected
with
his
official
duties
such
as
geodetical
survey
work
the
establishment
of
at
different
places
longitude
determinations
observation
of
eclipses
and
the
determination
of
the
density
of
the
earth
lastly
there
was
a
great
deal
of
time
and
work
given
to
questions
not
very
immediately
connected
with
his
office
but
on
which
the
government
asked
his
assistance
in
the
capacity
of
general
scientific
adviser
such
were
the
correction
of
the
compass
in
iron
ships
the
railway
gauge
commission
the
commission
for
the
restoration
of
the
standards
of
length
and
weight
the
maine
boundary
lighthouses
the
westminster
clock
the
london
university
and
many
other
questions
besides
those
there
were
a
great
many
subjects
which
he
took
up
out
of
sheer
interest
in
the
investigations
for
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
every
subject
of
a
distinctly
practical
nature
which
could
be
advanced
by
mathematical
knowledge
had
an
interest
for
him
and
his
incessant
industry
enabled
him
to
find
time
for
many
of
them
amongst
such
subjects
were
tides
and
tidal
observations
clockwork
and
the
strains
in
beams
and
bridges
a
certain
portion
of
his
time
was
also
given
to
lectures
generally
on
current
astronomical
questions
for
he
held
it
as
his
duty
to
popularize
the
science
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
and
he
attended
the
meetings
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
with
great
regularity
and
took
a
very
active
part
in
the
discussions
and
business
of
the
society
he
also
did
much
work
for
the
royal
society
and
up
to
a
certain
date
for
the
british
association
all
of
the
foregoing
matters
are
recorded
pretty
fully
in
his
autobiography
up
to
the
year
after
that
date
the
autobiography
is
given
in
a
much
more
abbreviated
form
and
might
rather
be
regarded
as
a
collection
of
notes
for
his
biography
his
private
history
is
given
very
fully
for
the
first
part
of
his
life
but
is
very
lightly
touched
upon
during
his
residence
at
greenwich
a
great
part
of
the
autobiography
is
in
a
somewhat
disjointed
state
and
appears
to
have
been
formed
by
extracts
from
a
number
of
different
sources
such
as
official
journals
official
correspondence
and
reports
in
editing
the
autobiography
it
has
been
thought
advisable
to
omit
a
large
number
of
short
notes
relating
to
the
routine
work
of
the
observatory
to
technical
and
scientific
correspondence
to
papers
communicated
to
various
societies
and
official
business
connected
with
them
and
to
miscellaneous
matters
of
minor
importance
these
in
the
aggregate
occupied
a
great
deal
of
time
and
attention
but
from
their
detached
nature
they
would
have
but
little
general
interest
at
various
places
will
be
found
short
memoirs
and
other
matter
by
the
editor
all
of
his
annual
reports
to
the
board
of
visitors
are
attached
to
his
autobiography
and
were
evidently
intended
to
be
read
with
it
and
to
form
part
of
it
these
reports
are
so
carefully
compiled
and
are
so
copious
that
they
form
a
very
complete
history
of
the
greenwich
observatory
and
of
the
work
carried
on
there
during
the
time
that
he
was
astronomer
royal
the
first
report
contained
only
four
pages
but
with
the
constantly
increasing
amount
and
range
of
work
the
reports
constantly
increased
in
volume
till
the
later
reports
contained
pages
extracts
from
these
reports
relating
to
matters
of
novelty
and
importance
and
illustrating
the
principles
which
guided
him
in
his
conduct
of
the
observatory
have
been
incorporated
with
the
autobiography
the
printed
papers
by
airy
are
bound
in
large
quarto
volumes
there
are
of
these
papers
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
a
list
of
them
is
appended
to
this
history
as
also
is
a
list
of
the
books
that
he
wrote
and
one
or
two
of
the
papers
which
were
separately
printed
they
form
a
very
important
part
of
his
life
work
and
are
frequently
referred
to
in
the
present
history
they
are
almost
all
to
be
found
in
the
transactions
of
societies
or
in
newspapers
and
extend
over
a
period
of
years
to
the
progress
made
in
certain
branches
of
science
during
this
long
period
can
very
fairly
be
traced
by
these
papers
his
private
correspondence
was
large
and
like
his
other
papers
it
was
carefully
arranged
no
business
letters
of
any
kind
are
included
under
this
head
in
this
correspondence
letters
are
occasionally
found
either
dealing
with
matters
of
importance
or
in
some
way
characteristic
and
these
have
been
inserted
in
this
biography
as
already
stated
the
autobiography
left
by
airy
is
confined
almost
entirely
to
science
and
business
and
touches
very
lightly
on
private
matters
or
correspondence
the
letters
to
his
wife
are
very
numerous
they
were
written
during
his
occasional
absences
from
home
on
business
or
for
relaxation
on
these
occasions
he
rarely
let
a
day
pass
without
writing
to
his
wife
and
sometimes
he
wrote
twice
on
the
same
day
they
are
full
of
energy
and
interest
and
many
extracts
from
them
are
inserted
in
this
history
a
great
deal
of
the
personal
history
is
taken
from
them
all
correspondence
in
any
way
connected
with
business
during
the
time
that
he
was
astronomer
royal
is
to
be
found
at
the
royal
observatory
it
is
all
bound
and
arranged
in
the
most
perfect
order
and
any
letter
throughout
this
time
can
be
found
with
the
greatest
ease
it
is
very
bulky
and
much
of
it
is
in
a
historical
sense
very
interesting
it
was
no
doubt
mainly
from
this
correspondence
that
the
autobiography
which
so
far
as
related
to
the
greenwich
part
of
it
was
almost
entirely
a
business
history
was
compiled
the
history
of
the
early
part
of
his
life
was
written
in
great
detail
and
contained
a
large
quantity
of
family
matter
which
was
evidently
not
intended
for
publication
this
part
of
the
autobiography
has
been
compressed
the
history
of
the
latter
part
of
his
life
was
not
written
by
himself
at
all
and
has
been
compiled
from
his
journal
and
other
sources
in
both
these
cases
and
occasionally
in
short
paragraphs
throughout
the
narrative
it
has
been
found
convenient
to
write
the
history

the
third
person

chapter

of
george
biddell
airy
the
history
of
airy
life
and
especially
the
history
of
his
work
is
given
in
the
chapters
that
follow
but
it
is
felt
that
the
present
memoir
would
be
incomplete
without
a
reference
to
those
personal
characteristics
upon
which
the
work
of
his
life
hinged
and
which
can
only
be
very
faintly
gathered
from
his
autobiography
he
was
of
medium
stature
and
not
powerfully
built
as
he
advanced
in
years
he
stooped
a
good
deal
his
hands
were
and
his
constitution
was
remarkably
sound
at
no
period
in
his
life
does
he
seem
to
have
taken
the
least
interest
in
athletic
sports
or
competitions
but
he
was
a
very
active
pedestrian
and
could
endure
a
great
deal
of
fatigue
he
was
by
no
means
wanting
in
physical
courage
and
on
various
occasions
especially
in
boating
expeditions
he
ran
considerable
risks
in
debate
and
controversy
he
had
great
and
was
absolutely
fearless
his
was
peculiar
and
required
correction
by
spectacles
the
lenses
of
which
were
ground
to
peculiar
curves
according
to
formulae
which
he
himself
investigated
with
these
spectacles
he
saw
extremely
well
and
he
commonly
carried
three
pairs
adapted
to
different
distances
he
took
great
interest
in
the
changes
that
took
place
in
his
and
wrote
several
papers
on
the
subject
in
his
later
years
he
became
somewhat
deaf
but
not
to
the
extent
of
serious
personal
inconvenience
the
ruling
feature
of
his
character
was
undoubtedly
order
from
the
time
that
he
went
up
to
cambridge
to
the
end
of
his
life
his
system
of
order
was
strictly
maintained
he
wrote
his
autobiography
up
to
date
soon
after
he
had
taken
his
degree
and
made
his
first
will
as
soon
as
he
had
any
money
to
leave
his
accounts
were
perfectly
kept
by
double
entry
throughout
his
life
and
he
valued
extremely
the
order
of
this
facility
of
keeping
accounts
was
very
useful
to
him
he
seems
not
to
have
destroyed
a
document
of
any
kind
whatever
counterfoils
of
old
notes
for
tradesmen
circulars
bills
and
correspondence
of
all
sorts
were
carefully
preserved
in
the
most
complete
order
from
the
time
that
he
went
to
cambridge
and
a
huge
mass
they
formed
to
a
high
appreciation
of
order
he
attributed
in
a
great
degree
his
command
of
mathematics
and
sometimes
spoke
of
mathematics
as
nothing
more
than
a
system
of
order
carried
to
a
considerable
extent
in
everything
he
was
methodical
and
orderly
and
he
had
the
greatest
dread
of
disorder
creeping
into
the
routine
work
of
the
observatory
even
in
the
smallest
matters
as
an
example
he
spent
a
whole
afternoon
in
writing
the
word
empty
on
large
cards
to
be
nailed
upon
a
great
number
of
empty
packing
boxes
because
he
noticed
a
little
confusion
arising
from
their
getting
mixed
with
other
boxes
containing
different
articles
and
an
assistant
could
not
be
spared
for
this
work
without
withdrawing
him
from
his
appointed
duties
his
arrangement
of
the
observatory
correspondence
was
excellent
and
elaborate
probably
no
papers
are
more
easy
of
reference
than
those
arranged
on
his
system
his
strict
habits
of
order
made
him
insist
very
much
upon
detail
in
his
business
with
others
and
the
rigid
discipline
arising
out
of
his
system
of
order
made
his
rule
irksome
to
such
of
his
subordinates
as
did
not
conform
readily
to
it
but
the
efficiency
of
the
observatory
unquestionably
depended
mainly
upon
it
as
his
powers
failed
with
age
the
ruling
passion
for
order
assumed
a
greater
prominence
and
in
his
last
days
he
seemed
to
be
more
anxious
to
put
letters
which
he
received
into
their
proper
place
for
reference
than
even
to
master
their
contents
his
nature
was
eminently
practical
and
any
subject
which
had
a
distinctly
practical
object
and
could
be
advanced
by
mathematical
investigation
possessed
interest
for
him
and
his
dislike
of
mere
theoretical
problems
and
investigations
was
proportionately
great
he
was
continually
at
war
with
some
of
the
resident
cambridge
mathematicians
on
this
subject
year
after
year
he
criticised
the
senate
house
papers
and
the
smith
prize
papers
question
by
question
very
severely
and
conducted
an
interesting
and
acrimonious
private
correspondence
with
professor
cayley
on
the
same
subject
his
great
mathematical
powers
and
his
command
of
mathematics
are
sufficiently
evidenced
by
the
numerous
mathematical
treatises
of
the
highest
order
which
he
published
a
list
of
which
is
appended
to
this
biography
but
a
very
important
feature
of
his
investigations
was
the
thoroughness
of
them
he
was
never
satisfied
with
leaving
a
result
as
a
barren
mathematical
expression
he
would
reduce
it
if
possible
to
a
practical
and
numerical
form
at
any
cost
of
labour
and
would
use
any
approximations
which
would
conduce
to
this
result
rather
than
leave
the
result
in
an
unfruitful
condition
he
never
shirked
arithmetical
work
the
longest
and
most
laborious
reductions
had
no
terrors
for
him
and
he
was
remarkably
skilful
with
the
various
mathematical
expedients
for
shortening
and
facilitating
arithmetical
work
of
a
complex
character
this
power
of
handling
arithmetic
was
of
great
value
to
him
in
the
observatory
reductions
and
in
the
observatory
work
generally
he
regarded
it
as
a
duty
to
finish
off
his
work
whatever
it
was
and
the
writer
well
remembers
his
comment
on
the
mathematics
of
one
of
his
old
friends
to
the
effect
that
he
was
too
fond
of
leaving
a
result
in
the
form
of
three
complex
equations
with
three
unknown
quantities
to
one
who
had
known
in
some
degree
of
the
enormous
quantity
of
arithmetical
work
which
he
had
turned
out
and
the
unsparing
manner
in
which
he
had
devoted
himself
to
it
there
was
something
very
pathetic
in
his
discovery
towards
the
close
of
his
long
life
that
the
figures
would
not
add
up
his
energy
and
business
capacity
were
remarkable
he
was
made
for
work
and
could
not
long
be
happy
without
it
whatever
subject
he
was
engaged
upon
he
kept
his
object
clearly
in
view
and
made
straight
for
it
aiming
far
more
at
clearness
and
directness
than
at
elegance
of
periods
or
symmetry
of
arrangement
he
wrote
his
letters
with
great
ease
and
rapidity
and
having
written
them
he
very
rarely
had
occasion
to
them
though
he
often
added
insertions
and
interlineations
even
in
the
most
important
official
letters
without
this
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
turned
out
the
enormous
quantity
of
correspondence
that
he
did
he
never
dictated
letters
and
only
availed
himself
of
clerical
assistance
in
matters
of
the
most
ordinary
routine
in
his
excursions
as
in
his
work
he
was
always
energetic
and
could
not
endure
inaction
whatever
there
was
of
interest
in
the
places
that
he
visited
he
examined
thoroughly
and
without
delay
and
then
passed
on
and
he
thus
accomplished
a
great
deal
in
a
short
vacation
his
letters
written
to
his
wife
while
he
was
on
his
excursions
are
very
numerous
and
characteristic
and
afford
ample
proofs
of
his
incessant
energy
and
activity
both
of
body
and
mind
they
are
not
brilliantly
written
for
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
write
for
effect
and
he
would
never
give
himself
the
trouble
to
study
the
composition
of
his
letters
but
they
are
clear
and
concise
and
he
was
never
at
a
loss
for
suitable
language
to
express
his
ideas
he
had
a
wonderful
capacity
for
enjoyment
the
subjects
that
chiefly
interested
him
were
scenery
architecture
and
antiquities
but
everything
novel
or
curious
had
an
interest
for
him
he
made
several
journeys
to
the
continent
but
by
far
the
greater
number
of
his
excursions
were
made
in
england
and
scotland
and
there
were
few
parts
of
the
country
which
he
had
not
visited
he
was
very
fond
of
the
lake
district
of
cumberland
and
visited
it
very
frequently
and
each
time
that
he
went
there
the
same
set
of
views
had
an
eternal
freshness
for
him
and
he
wrote
long
descriptions
of
the
scenery
and
effects
with
the
same
raptures
as
if
he
had
seen
it
for
the
first
time
many
of
his
letters
were
written
from
playford
a
village
in
a
beautiful
part
of
suffolk
a
few
miles
from
ipswich
here
he
had
a
small
property
and
generally
stayed
there
for
a
short
time
once
or
twice
a
year
he
was
extremely
fond
of
this
country
and
was
never
tired
of
repeating
his
walks
by
the
lanes
and
footpaths
and
as
in
cumberland
the
suffolk
country
had
an
eternal
freshness
and
novelty
for
him
wherever
he
went
he
was
indefatigable
in
keeping
up
his
acquaintance
with
his
numerous
friends
and
his
letters
abound
in
social
reminiscences
his
memory
was
singularly
retentive
it
was
much
remarked
at
school
in
his
early
days
and
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
stored
up
in
his
memory
an
incredible
quantity
of
poetry
ballads
and
miscellaneous
facts
and
information
of
all
sorts
which
was
all
constantly
ready
and
at
his
service
it
is
almost
needless
to
add
that
his
memory
was
equally
accurate
and
extensive
in
matters
connected
with
science
or
business
his
independence
of
character
was
no
doubt
due
to
and
inseparable
from
his
great
powers
the
value
of
his
scientific
work
greatly
depended
upon
his
and
independence
of
thought
and
in
the
heavy
work
of
remodelling
the
observatory
it
was
a
very
valuable
quality
this
same
made
him
in
his
latter
years
apt
to
draw
conclusions
too
confidently
and
hastily
on
subjects
which
he
had
taken
up
more
as
a
pastime
than
as
work
but
whatever
he
touched
he
dealt
with
ably
and
in
the
most
fearless
truthseeking
manner
and
left
original
and
vigorous
opinions
he
had
a
remarkably
mind
and
a
simplicity
of
nature
that
appeared
invulnerable
no
amount
of
seemed
to
have
the
least
effect
upon
him
and
from
a
very
early
time
he
was
exposed
to
a
great
deal
of
it
his
mind
was
incessantly
engaged
on
investigations
of
nature
and
this
seems
to
have
been
with
him
as
has
been
the
case
with
others
a
preserving
influence
this
simplicity
of
character
he
retained
throughout
his
life
at
the
same
time
he
was
sensible
and
shrewd
in
his
money
matters
and
attentive
to
his
personal
interests
and
his
practical
good
sense
in
the
general
affairs
of
life
combined
with
his
calm
and
steady
consideration
of
points
submitted
to
him
made
his
advice
very
valuable
this
was
especially
recognized
by
his
own
and
his
wife
relations
who
consulted
him
on
many
occasions
and
placed
the
fullest
confidence
in
his
absolute
sense
of
justice
as
well
as
in
his
wise
counsel
he
was
extremely
liberal
in
proportion
to
his
means
and
gave
away
money
to
a
large
extent
to
all
who
had
any
claim
upon
him
but
he
was
not
in
any
sense
reckless
and
kept
a
most
cautious
eye
on
his
expenses
he
was
not
indifferent
to
the
honours
which
he
received
in
the
scientific
world
but
he
does
not
appear
to
have
sought
them
in
any
way
and
he
certainly
did
not
trouble
himself
about
them
his
courtesy
was
unfailing
no
amount
of
trouble
could
shake
it
whether
it
was
the
secretary
of
the
admiralty
or
a
servant
girl
wanting
her
fortune
told
whether
a
for
money
or
miscellaneous
invitations
all
had
their
answer
in
the
most
clear
and
courteous
language
but
he
would
not
grant
personal
interviews
when
he
could
avoid
it
they
took
up
too
much
of
his
time
his
head
was
so
clear
that
he
never
seemed
to
want
for
the
clearest
and
most
direct
language
in
expressing
his
meaning
and
his
letters
are
models
of
terseness
in
all
his
views
and
opinions
he
was
strongly
liberal
at
cambridge
at
an
early
date
he
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
senate
who
supported
the
application
to
permit
the
granting
of
medical
degrees
without
requiring
an
expression
of
assent
to
the
religious
doctrines
of
the
church
of
england
and
in
he
declined
to
sign
a
petition
against
the
abolition
of
religious
declarations
required
of
persons
admitted
to
fellowships
or
proceeding
to
the
degree
of
and
he
was
opposed
to
every
kind
of
narrowness
and
exclusiveness
when
he
was
appointed
to
the
post
of
astronomer
royal
he
stipulated
that
he
should
not
be
asked
to
vote
in
any
political
election
but
all
his
views
were
in
the
liberal
direction
he
was
a
great
reader
of
theology
and
church
history
and
as
regarded
forms
of
worship
and
the
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
he
treated
them
with
great
respect
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
freethinking
layman
in
the
preface
to
his
notes
on
the
earlier
hebrew
scriptures
he
says
in
regard
to
the
general
tone
of
these
notes
i
will
first
remark
that
i
have
nothing
to
say
on
the
subject
of
verbal
inspiration
with
those
who
entertain
that
doctrine
i
can
have
nothing
in
common
nor
do
i
recognize
in
the
professedly
historical
accounts
any
other
inspiration
which
can
exempt
them
from
the
severest
criticism
that
would
be
applicable
to
profane
accounts
written
under
the
same
general
circumstances
and
in
the
same
countries
and
his
treatment
of
the
subject
in
the
notes
shews
how
entirely
he
took
a
rationalistic
view
of
the
whole
question
he
also
strongly
sided
with
bishop
colenso
in
his
fearless
criticism
of
the
pentateuch
though
he
dissented
from
some
of
his
conclusions
but
he
was
deeply
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
religion
and
reflected
much
upon
it
his
whole
correspondence
conveys
the
impression
of
the
most
sterling
integrity
and
without
a
trace
of
affectation
in
no
letter
does
there
appear
a
shadow
of
wavering
on
matters
of
principle
whether
in
public
or
private
matters
and
he
was
very
clear
and
positive
in
his
convictions
the
great
secret
of
his
long
and
successful
official
career
was
that
he
was
a
good
servant
and
thoroughly
understood
his
position
he
never
set
himself
in
opposition
to
his
masters
the
admiralty
he
never
hesitated
to
ask
the
admiralty
for
what
he
thought
right
whether
in
the
way
of
money
grants
for
various
objects
or
for
occasional
permission
to
give
his
services
to
scientific
matters
not
immediately
connected
with
the
observatory
sometimes
the
admiralty
refused
his
requests
and
he
felt
this
very
keenly
but
he
was
far
too
busy
and
energetic
to
trouble
himself
about
such
little
slights
and
cheerfully
accepted
the
situation
what
was
refused
by
one
administration
was
frequently
granted
by
another
and
in
the
meantime
he
was
always
ready
to
give
his
most
zealous
assistance
in
any
matter
that
was
officially
brought
before
him
this
cheerful
readiness
to
help
combined
with
his
great
ability
and
punctuality
in
business
matters
made
him
a
very
valuable
servant
and
speaking
generally
he
had
the
confidence
of
the
admiralty
in
a
remarkable
degree
in
many
of
his
reports
to
the
board
of
visitors
he
speaks
gratefully
of
the
liberality
of
the
admiralty
in
forwarding
scientific
progress
and
research
in
matters
too
which
are
perhaps
of
minor
importance
from
the
high
of
science
but
which
are
invaluable
in
the
conduct
of
an
important
business
office
such
for
example
as
estimates
and
official
correspondence
he
was
orderly
and
punctual
in
the
highest
degree
and
what
is
by
no
means
unimportant
he
possessed
an
excellent
official
style
in
correspondence
combined
with
great
clearness
of
expression
his
entire
honesty
of
purpose
and
the
high
respect
in
which
he
was
held
both
at
home
and
abroad
gave
great
weight
to
his
recommendations
with
regard
to
his
habits
while
he
resided
at
the
observatory
his
custom
was
to
work
in
his
official
room
from
to
about
though
in
summer
he
was
frequently
at
work
before
breakfast
he
then
took
a
brisk
walk
and
dined
at
about
this
early
hour
had
been
prescribed
and
insisted
upon
by
his
physician
dr
haviland
of
cambridge
in
whom
he
had
great
confidence
he
ate
heartily
though
simply
and
moderately
and
slept
for
about
an
hour
after
dinner
he
then
had
tea
and
from
about
to
he
worked
in
the
same
room
with
his
family
he
would
never
retire
to
a
private
room
and
regarded
the
society
of
his
family
as
highly
beneficial
in
taking
the
edge
off
his
work
his
powers
of
abstraction
were
remarkable
nothing
seemed
to
disturb
him
neither
music
singing
nor
miscellaneous
conversation
he
would
then
play
a
game
or
two
at
cards
read
a
few
pages
of
a
classical
or
historical
book
and
retire
at
on
sundays
he
attended
morning
service
at
church
and
in
the
evening
read
a
few
prayers
very
carefully
and
impressively
to
his
whole
household
he
was
very
hospitable
and
delighted
to
receive
his
friends
in
a
simple
and
natural
way
at
his
house
in
this
he
was
most
admirably
aided
by
his
wife
whose
grace
and
skill
made
everything
pleasant
to
their
guests
but
he
avoided
as
much
as
possible
they
interfered
too
much
with
his
work
and
with
the
exception
of
scientific
and
official
dinners
he
seldom
dined
away
from
home
his
tastes
were
entirely
domestic
and
he
was
very
happy
in
his
family
with
his
natural
love
of
work
and
with
the
incessant
calls
upon
him
he
would
soon
have
broken
down
had
it
not
been
for
his
system
of
regular
relaxation
two
or
three
times
a
year
he
took
a
holiday
generally
a
short
run
of
a
week
or
ten
days
in
the
spring
a
trip
of
a
month
or
thereabouts
in
the
early
autumn
and
about
three
weeks
at
playford
in
the
winter
these
trips
were
always
conducted
in
the
most
active
manner
either
in
constant
motion
from
place
to
place
or
in
daily
active
excursions
this
system
he
maintained
with
great
regularity
and
from
the
exceeding
interest
and
enjoyment
that
he
took
in
these
trips
his
mind
was
so
much
refreshed
and
steadied
that
he
always
kept
himself
equal
to
his
work
airy
seems
to
have
had
a
strong
bent
in
the
direction
of
astronomy
from
his
youth
and
it
is
curious
to
note
how
well
furnished
he
was
by
the
time
that
he
became
astronomer
royal
both
with
astronomy
in
all
its
branches
and
with
the
kindred
sciences
so
necessary
for
the
practical
working
and
improvement
of
it
at
the
time
that
he
went
to
cambridge
physical
astronomy
was
greatly
studied
there
and
formed
a
most
important
part
of
the
university
course
he
eagerly
availed
himself
of
this
and
mastered
the
physical
astronomy
in
the
most
thorough
manner
as
was
evidenced
by
his
papers
collected
in
his
mathematical
tracts
his
investigation
of
the
long
inequality
of
the
earth
and
venus
and
many
other
works
as
plumian
professor
he
had
charge
of
the
small
observatory
at
cambridge
where
he
did
a
great
deal
of
the
observing
and
reduction
work
himself
and
became
thoroughly
versed
in
the
practical
working
of
an
observatory
the
result
of
this
was
immediately
seen
in
the
improved
methods
which
he
introduced
at
greenwich
and
which
were
speedily
imitated
at
other
observatories
optics
and
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
had
been
very
favourite
subjects
with
him
and
he
had
written
and
lectured
frequently
upon
them
in
the
construction
of
the
new
and
powerful
telescopes
and
other
optical
instruments
required
from
time
to
time
this
knowledge
was
very
essential
for
in
its
instrumental
equipment
the
greenwich
observatory
was
entirely
remodelled
during
his
tenure
of
office
and
in
many
of
the
matters
referred
to
him
as
for
instance
that
of
the
lighthouses
a
thorough
knowledge
of
optics
was
most
valuable
he
had
made
a
great
study
of
the
theory
and
construction
of
clocks
and
this
knowledge
was
invaluable
to
him
at
greenwich
in
the
establishment
of
new
and
more
accurate
astronomical
clocks
and
especially
in
the
improvement
of
chronometers
he
had
carefully
studied
the
theory
of
pendulums
and
had
learned
how
to
use
them
in
his
experiments
in
the
cornish
mines
this
knowledge
he
afterwards
utilized
very
effectively
at
the
harton
pit
in
comparing
the
density
of
the
earth
crust
with
its
mean
density
and
it
was
very
useful
to
him
in
connection
with
geodetic
surveys
and
experiments
on
which
he
was
consulted
and
his
mechanical
knowledge
was
useful
in
almost
everything
the
subjects
outside
those
required
for
his
professional
work
in
which
he
took
most
interest
were
poetry
history
theology
antiquities
architecture
and
engineering
he
was
well
acquainted
with
standard
english
poetry
and
had
committed
large
quantities
to
memory
which
he
frequently
referred
to
as
a
most
valuable
acquisition
and
an
relief
and
comfort
to
his
mind
history
and
theology
he
had
studied
as
opportunity
offered
and
without
being
widely
read
in
them
he
was
much
at
home
with
them
and
his
powerful
memory
made
the
most
of
what
he
did
read
antiquities
and
architecture
were
very
favourite
subjects
with
him
he
had
visited
most
of
the
camps
and
castles
in
the
united
kingdom
and
was
never
tired
of
tracing
their
connection
with
ancient
military
events
and
he
wrote
several
papers
on
this
subject
especially
those
relating
to
the
roman
invasions
of
britain
ecclesiastical
architecture
he
was
very
fond
of
he
had
visited
nearly
all
the
cathedrals
and
principal
churches
in
england
and
many
on
the
continent
and
was
most
enthusiastic
on
their
different
styles
and
merits
his
letters
abound
in
critical
remarks
on
them
he
was
extremely
well
versed
in
mechanics
and
in
the
principles
and
theory
of
construction
and
took
the
greatest
interest
in
large
engineering
works
this
led
to
much
communication
with
stephenson
brunel
and
other
engineers
who
consulted
him
freely
on
the
subject
of
great
works
on
which
they
were
engaged
in
particular
he
rendered
much
assistance
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
the
britannia
bridge
over
the
menai
straits
there
were
various
other
subjects
which
he
read
with
much
interest
geology
in
particular
but
he
made
no
study
of
natural
history
and
knew
very
little
about
it
beyond
detached
facts
his
industry
was
untiring
and
in
going
over
his
books
one
by
one
it
was
very
noticeable
how
large
a
number
of
them
were
feathered
with
his
paper
marks
shewing
how
carefully
he
had
read
them
and
referred
to
them
his
nature
was
essentially
cheerful
and
literature
of
a
witty
and
humourous
character
had
a
great
charm
for
him
he
was
very
fond
of
music
and
knew
a
great
number
of
songs
and
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
theory
of
music
but
he
was
no
performer
he
did
not
sketch
freehand
but
made
excellent
drawings
with
his
camera
lucida
at
the
time
when
he
took
his
degree
and
for
many
years
afterwards
there
was
very
great
activity
of
scientific
investigation
and
astronomical
enterprise
in
england
and
as
in
the
times
of
flamsteed
and
halley
the
earnest
zeal
of
men
of
science
occasionally
led
to
much
controversy
and
bitterness
amongst
them
airy
was
by
no
means
exempt
from
such
controversies
he
was
a
man
of
keen
sensitiveness
though
it
was
combined
with
great
steadiness
of
temper
and
he
never
hesitated
to
attack
theories
and
methods
that
he
considered
to
be
scientifically
wrong
this
led
to
differences
with
ivory
challis
south
cayley
archibald
smith
and
others
but
however
much
he
might
differ
from
them
he
was
always
personally
courteous
and
the
disputes
generally
went
no
farther
than
as
regarded
the
special
matter
in
question
almost
all
these
controversial
discussions
were
carried
on
openly
and
were
published
in
the
athenaeum
the
philosophical
magazine
or
elsewhere
for
he
printed
nearly
everything
that
he
wrote
and
was
very
careful
in
the
selection
of
the
most
suitable
channels
for
publication
he
regarded
it
as
a
duty
to
popularize
as
much
as
possible
the
work
done
at
the
observatory
and
to
take
the
public
into
his
confidence
and
this
he
effected
by
articles
communicated
to
newspapers
lectures
numerous
papers
written
for
scientific
societies
reports
debates
and
critiques
his
strong
constitution
and
his
regular
habits
both
of
work
and
exercise
are
sufficient
explanation
of
the
good
health
which
in
general
he
enjoyed
not
but
what
he
had
sharp
touches
of
illness
from
time
to
time
at
one
period
he
suffered
a
good
deal
from
an
attack
of
eczema
and
at
another
from
a
varicose
vein
in
his
leg
and
he
was
occasionally
troubled
with
severe
colds
but
he
bore
these
ailments
with
great
patience
and
threw
them
off
in
course
of
time
he
was
happy
in
his
marriage
and
in
his
family
and
such
troubles
and
distresses
as
were
inevitable
he
accepted
calmly
and
quietly
in
his
death
as
in
his
life
he
was
fortunate
he
had
no
long
or
painful
illness
and
he
was
spared
the
calamity
of
aberration
of
intellect
the
saddest
of
all
visitations

his
father
was
william
airy
of
luddington
in
lincolnshire
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
airys
who
have
been
traced
back
with
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
to
a
family
of
that
name
which
was
settled
at
kentmere
in
westmorland
in
the
century
a
branch
of
this
family
migrated
to
pontefract
in
yorkshire
where
they
seem
to
have
prospered
for
many
years
but
they
were
involved
in

retired
to
ousefleet

of
prudent
and
steady
character
when
a
young
man
he
became
foreman
on
a
farm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
luddington
and
laid
by
his
earnings
in
summer
in
order
to
educate
himself
in
winter
for
a
person
in
his
rank
his
education
was
unusually
good
in
matters
of
science
and
in
english
literature
but
at
the
age
of
he
grew
tired
of
country
labour
and
obtained
a
post
in
the
excise
after
serving
in
various
collections
he
was
appointed
collector
of
the
northumberland
collection
on
the
august
and
during
his
service
there
his
eldest
son
george
biddell
airy
was
born
the
time
over
which
his
service
as
officer
and
supervisor
extended
was
that
in
which
smuggling
rose
to
a
very
high
pitch
and
in
which
the
position
of
excise
officer
was
sometimes
dangerous
he
was
remarkable
for
his
activity
and
boldness
in
contests
with
smugglers
and
made
many
seizures
ann
airy
the
mother
of
george
biddell
airy
was
a
woman
of
great
natural
abilities
both
speculative
and
practical
kind
as
a
neighbour
and
as
head
of
a
family
and
was
deeply
loved
and
respected
the

died
young
william
airy
was
appointed
to
hereford
collection
on
october
and
removed
thither
shortly
after
he
stayed
at
hereford
till
he
was
appointed
to
essex
collection
on
february
and
during
this
time
george
biddell
was
educated
at
elementary
schools
in
writing
arithmetic
and
a
little
latin
he
records
of
himself
that
he
was
not
a
favourite
with
the
schoolboys
for
he
had
very
little
animal
vivacity
and
seldom
joined
in
active
play
with
his
schoolfellows
but
in
the
proceedings
of
the
school
he
was
successful
and
was
a
favourite
with
his
master
on
the
appointment
of
william
airy
to
essex
collection
the
family
removed
to
colchester
on
april
here
george
biddell
was
first
sent
to
a
large
school
in
sir
isaac
walk
then
kept
by
mr
byatt
walker
and
was
soon
noted
for
his
correctness
in
orthography
geography
and
arithmetic
he
evidently
made
rapid
progress
for
on
one
occasion
mr
walker
said
openly
in
the
schoolroom
how
remarkable
it
was
that
a
boy
years
old
should
be
the
first
in
the
school
at
this
school
he
stayed
till
the
end
of
and
thoroughly
learned
arithmetic
from
walkingame
book
by
double
entry
on
which
knowledge
throughout
his
life
he
set
a
special
value
the
use
of
the
sliding
rule
which
knowledge
also
was
specially
useful
to
him
in
after
life
mensuration
and
algebra
from
bonnycastle
books
he
also
studied
grammar
in
all
its
branches
and
geography
and
acquired
some
knowledge
of
english
literature
beginning
with
that
admirable
book
the
speaker
but
it
does
not
appear
that
latin
and
greek
were
attended
to
at
this
school
he
records
that
at
this
time
he
learned
an
infinity
of
snatches
of
songs
small
romances
which
his
powerful
memory
retained
most
accurately
throughout
his
life
he
was
no
hand
at
active
play
but
was
notorious
for
his
skill
in
constructing
guns
for
shooting
peas
and
arrows
and
other
mechanical
contrivances
at
home
he
relates
that
he
picked
up
a
wonderful
quantity
of
learning
from
his
father
books
he
read
and
remembered
much
poetry
from
such
standard
authors
as
milton
pope
gay
gray
swift
which
was
destined
to
prove
in
after
life
an
invaluable
relaxation
for
his
mind
but
he
also
studied
deeply
an
excellent
cyclopaedia
called
a
dictionary
of
arts
and
sciences
in
three
volumes
folio
and
learned
from
it
much
about
navigation
fortification
and
many
other
subjects
during
this
period
his
valuable
friendship
with
his
uncle
arthur
biddell
commenced
arthur
biddell
was
a
prosperous
farmer
and
valuer
at
playford
near
ipswich
he
was
a
and
able
man
of
powerful
and
original
mind
extremely
kind
and
and
greatly
respected
throughout
the
county
in
the
autobiography
of
george
biddell
airy
he
states
as
follows
i
do
not
remember
precisely
when
it
was
that
i
first
visited
my
uncle
arthur
biddell
i
think
it
was
in
a
winter
certainly
as
early
as
the
winter
of
here
i
found
a
friend
whose
society
i
could
enjoy
and
i
entirely
appreciated
and
enjoyed
the
practical
mechanical
and
at
the
same
time
speculative
and
enquiring
talents
of
arthur
biddell
he
had
a
library
which
for
a
person
in
middle
life
may
be
called
excellent
and
his
historical
and
antiquarian
knowledge
was
not
small
after
spending
one
winter
holiday
with
him
it
easily
came
to
pass
that
i
spent
the
next
summer
holiday
with
him
and
at
the
next
winter
holiday
finding
that
there
was
no
precise
arrangement
for
my
movements
i
secretly
wrote
him
a
letter
begging
him
to
come
with
a
gig
to
fetch
me
home
with
him
he
complied
with
my
request
giving
no
hint
to
my
father
or
mother
of
my
letter
and
from
that
time
of
every
year
was
regularly
spent
with
him
till
i
went
to
college
how
great
was
the
influence
of
this
on
my
character
and
education
i
can
not
tell
it
was
with
him
that
i
became
acquainted
with
the
messrs
ransome
cubitt
the
civil
engineer
afterwards
sir
cubitt
bernard
barton
thomas
clarkson
the
abolitionist
and
other
persons
whose
acquaintance
i
have
valued
highly
it
was
also
with
him
that
i
became
acquainted
with
the
works
of
the
best
modern
poets
scott
byron
campbell
hogg
and
others
as
also
with
the
waverley
novels
and
other
works
of
merit
in
william
airy
lost
his
appointment
of
collector
of
excise
and
was
in
consequence
very
much
straitened
in
his
circumstances
but
there
was
no
relaxation
in
the
education
of
his
children
and
at
the
beginning
of
george
biddell
was
sent
to
the
endowed
grammar
school
at
colchester
then
kept
by
the
rev
crosse
and
remained
there
till
the
summer
of
when
he
went
to
college
the
autobiography
proceeds
as
follows
i
became
here
a
respectable
scholar
in
latin
and
greek
to
the
extent
of
accurate
translation
and
composition
of
prose
latin
in
regard
to
latin
verses
i
was
i
think
more
defective
than
most
scholars
who
take
the
same
pains
but
i
am
not
much
ashamed
of
this
for
i
entirely
despise
the
system
of
instruction
in
verse
composition
my
father
on
some
occasion
had
to
go
to
london
and
brought
back
for
me
a
pair
of
globes
they
were
invaluable
to
me
the
first
stars
which
i
learnt
from
the
celestial
globe
were
alpha
lyrae
alpha
aquilae
alpha
cygni
and
to
this
time
i
involuntarily
regard
these
stars
as
the
of
my
astronomical
knowledge
having
somewhere
seen
a
description
of
a
gunter
quadrant
i
perceived
that
i
could
construct
one
by
means
of
the
globe
my
father
procured
for
me
a
board
of
the
proper
shape
with
paper
pasted
on
it
and
on
this
i
traced
the
lines
of
the
quadrant
my
command
of
geometry
was
tolerably
complete
and
one
way
in
which
i
frequently
amused
myself
was
by
making
paper
models
most
carefully
drawn
in
outline
which
were
buttoned
together
without
any
cement
or
sewing
thus
i
made
models
not
only
of
regular
solids
regularly
irregular
solids
cones
cut
in
all
directions
so
as
to
shew
the
conic
sections
and
the
like
but
also
of
batteries
intrenchments
and
fortresses
of
various
kinds
from
various
books
i
had
learnt
the
construction
of
the
the
older
forms
from
the
dictionary
of
arts
and
sciences
newer
forms
from
modern
books
the
newest
form
however
with
the
sliding
steam
valve
i
learnt
from
a
engine
at
bawtrey
brewery
in
which
mr
keeling
the
father
of
my
schoolfellow
had
acquired
a
partnership
i
frequently
went
to
look
at
this
engine
and
on
one
occasion
had
the
extreme
felicity
of
examining
some
of
its
parts
when
it
was
opened
for
repair
in
the
mean
time
my
education
was
advancing
at
playford
the
first
record
i
believe
which
i
have
of
my
attention
to
mechanics
there
is
the
plan
of
a
which
i
drew
but
i
was
acquiring
valuable
information
of
all
kinds
from
the
encyclopaedia
londinensis
a
work
which
without
being
high
in
any
respect
is
one
of
the
most
generally
useful
that
i
have
seen
but
i
well
remember
one
of
the
most
important
steps
that
i
ever
made
i
had
tried
experiments
with
the
of
an
and
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
the
images
of
objects
seen
through
the
glass
under
different
conditions
by
these
things
my
thoughts
were
turned
to
accurate
optics
and
i
read
with
care
rutherford
lectures
which
my
uncle
possessed
the
acquisition
of
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
effect
of
optical
constructions
was
one
of
the
most
charming
attainments
that
i
ever
reached
long
before
i
went
to
college
i
understood
the
action
of
the
lenses
of
a
telescope
better
than
most
opticians
i
also
read
with
great
zeal
nicholson
dictionary
of
chemistry
and
occasionally
made
chemical
experiments
of
an
inexpensive
kind
indeed
i
grew
so
fond
of
this
subject
that
there
was
some
thought
of
apprenticing
me
to
a
chemist
i
also
attended
to
surveying
and
made
a
tolerable
survey
and
map
of
my
uncle
farm
at
school
i
was
going
on
successfully
and
distinguished
myself
particularly
by
my
memory
it
was
the
custom
for
each
boy
once
a
week
to
repeat
a
number
of
lines
of
latin
or
greek
poetry
the
number
depending
very
much
on
his
own
choice
i
determined
on
repeating
every
week
and
i
never
once
fell
below
that
number
and
was
sometimes
much
above
it
it
was
no
distress
to
me
and
great
enjoyment
at
michaelmas
i
repeated
lines
probably
without
missing
a
word
i
do
not
think
that
i
was
a
favourite
with
mr
crosse
but
he
certainly
had
a
high
opinion
of
my
powers
and
expressed
this
to
my
father
my
father
entertained
the
idea
of
sending
me
to
college
which
mr
crosse
recommended
but
he
heard
from
some
college
man
that
the
expense
would
be
a
year
and
he
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
it
the
farm
of
playford
hall
was
in
or
hired
by
thomas
clarkson
the
abolitionist
my
uncle
transacted
much
business
for
him
as
a
neighbour
and
friend
in
the
management
of
the
farm
for
a
time
and
they
became
very
intimate
my
uncle
begged
him
to
examine
me
in
classical
knowledge
and
he
did
so
i
think
twice
he
also
gave
some
better
information
about
the
probable
expenses
at
college
the
result
was
a
strong
recommendation
by
my
uncle
or
through
my
uncle
that
i
should
be
sent
to
cambridge
and
this
was
adopted
by
my
father
i
think
it
likely
that
this
was
in
in
december
dealtry
fluxions
was
bought
for
me
and
i
read
it
and
understood
it
well
i
borrowed
hutton
course
of
mathematics
of
old
mr
ransome
who
had
come
to
reside
at
greenstead
near
colchester
and
read
a
good
deal
of
it
about
ladyday
i
began
to
read
mathematics
with
mr
rogers
formerly
i
think
a
fellow
of
sidney
college
and
an
indifferent
mathematician
of
the
cambridge
school
who
had
succeeded
a
mr
tweed
as
assistant
to
mr
crosse
in
the
school
i
went
to
his
house
twice
a
week
on
holiday
afternoons
i
do
not
remember
how
long
i
received
lessons
from
him
but
i
think
to
june
this
course
was
extremely
valuable
to
me
not
on
account
of
mr
rogers
abilities
for
i
understood
many
things
better
than
he
did
but
for
its
training
me
both
in
cambridge
subjects
and
in
the
cambridge
accurate
methods
of
treating
them
i
went
through
euclid
as
far
as
usually
read
algebra
wood
mechanics
vince
hydrostatics
wood
optics
trigonometry
in
a
geometrical
treatise
and
also
in
algebraical
form
fluxions
to
a
good
extent
newton
principia
to
the
end
of
the
section
this
was
a
large
quantity
but
i
read
it
accurately
and
understood
it
perfectly
and
could
write
out
any
one
of
the
propositions
which
i
had
read
in
the
most
exact
form
my
connexion
with
mr
rogers
was
terminated
by
giving
me
notice
that
he
could
not
undertake
to
receive
me
any
longer
in
fact
i
was
too
much
for
him
i
generally
read
these
books
in
a
garret
in
our
house
in
george
lane
which
was
indefinitely
appropriated
to
my
brother
and
myself
i
find
that
i
copied
out
vince
conic
sections
in
february
the
first
book
that
i
copied
was
the
small
geometrical
treatise
on
trigonometry
in
may
to
this
i
was
urged
by
old
mr
ransome
upon
my
complaining
that
i
could
not
purchase
the
book
and
it
was
no
bad
lesson
of
independence
to
me
during
the
same
period
he
was
occupied
at
school
on
translations
into
blank
verse
from
the
aeneid
and
iliad
and
read
through
the
whole
of
sophocles
very
carefully
the
classical
knowledge
which
he
thus
gained
at
school
and
subsequently
at
cambridge
was
sound
and
he
took
great
pleasure
in
it
throughout
his
life
he
made
a
practice
of
keeping
one
or
other
of
the
classical
authors
at
hand
for
occasional
relaxation
he
terminated
his
schooling
in
june
shortly
afterwards
his
father
left
colchester
and
went
to
reside
at
bury
st
edmund
the
autobiography
proceeds
as
follows
mr
clarkson
was
at
one
time
inclined
to
recommend
me
to
go
to
st
peter
college
which
had
been
much
enriched
by
a
bequest
from
a
mr
gisborne
but
on
giving
some
account
of
me
to
his
friend
mr
james
hustler
tutor
of
trinity
college
mr
hustler
urged
upon
him
that
i
was
exactly
the
proper
sort
of
person
to
go
to
trinity
college
and
thus
it
was
settled
mainly
by
mr
clarkson
that
i
should
be
entered
at
trinity
college
i
think
that
i
was
sent
for
purposely
from
colchester
to
playford
and
on
march
i
rode
in
company
with
mr
clarkson
from
playford
to
sproughton
near
ipswich
to
be
examined
by
the
rev
mr
rogers
incumbent
of
sproughton
an
old
of
trinity
college
and
was
examined
and
my
certificate
duly
sent
to
mr
hustler
and
i
was
entered
on
mr
hustler
side
as
sizar
of
trinity
college
in
the
summer
of
i
spent
some
time
at
playford
on
july
my
birthday
years
old
mr
clarkson
invited
me
to
dinner
to
meet
mr
charles
musgrave
fellow
of
trinity
college
who
was
residing
for
a
short
time
at
grundisburgh
taking
the
church
duty
there
for
dr
ramsden
the
rector
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
go
to
grundisburgh
the
next
day
i
think
to
be
examined
in
mathematics
by
mr
musgrave
i
went
accordingly
and
mr
musgrave
set
before
me
a
paper
of
questions
in
geometry
algebra
mechanics
optics
ending
with
the
first
proposition
of
the
principia
i
knew
nothing
more
about
my
answers
at
the
time
but
i
found
long
after
that
they
excited
so
much
admiration
that
they
were
transmitted
to
cambridge
i
forget
whether
to
mr
musgrave
brother
a
fellow
of
trinity
college
and
afterwards
archbishop
of
york
or
to
mr
peacock
afterwards
dean
of
ely
and
were
long
preserved
the
list
of
the
classical
subjects
for
the
first
year
in
trinity
college
was
transmitted
to
me
as
usual
by
mr
hustler
they
were
the
hippolytus
of
euripides
the
book
of
thucydides
and
the
philippic
of
cicero
these
i
read
carefully
and
noted
before
going
up
mr
hustler
family
lived
in
bury
and
i
called
on
him
and
saw
him
in
october
introduced
by
mr
clarkson
on
the
morning
of
october
i
went
on
the
top
of
the
coach
to
cambridge
knowing
nobody
there
but
mr
hustler
but
having
letters
of
introduction
from
mr
charles
musgrave
to
professor
sedgwick
mr
thomas
musgrave
and
mr
george
peacock
all
fellows
of
trinity
college
i
was
set
down
at
the
hoop
saw
trinity
college
for
the
first
time
found
mr
hustler
was
conducted
by
his
servant
to
the
where
i
was
invested
in
the
cap
and
blue
gown
and
after
some
further
waiting
was
installed
into
lodgings
in
bridge
street
at
i
went
to
the
college
hall
and
was
introduced
by
mr
hustler
to
several
undergraduates
generally
clever
men
and
in
the
evening
i
attended
chapel
in
my
surplice
it
being
st
luke
day
and
witnessed
that
splendid
service
of
which
the
occasional
exhibition
well
befits
the
place
as
soon
as
possible
i
called
on
mr
peacock
mr
musgrave
and
professor
sedgwick
by
all
i
was
received
with
great
kindness
my
examination
papers
had
been
sent
to
them
and
a
considerable
reputation
preceded
me
mr
peacock
at
once
desired
that
i
would
not
consider
mr
musgrave
letter
as
an
ordinary
introduction
but
that
i
would
refer
to
him
on
all
occasions
and
i
did
so
for
several
years
and
always
received
from
him
the
greatest
assistance
that
he
could
give
i
think
that
i
did
not
become
acquainted
with
mr
whewell
till
the
next
term
when
i
met
him
at
a
breakfast
party
at
mr
peacock
mr
peacock
at
once
warned
me
to
arrange
for
taking
regular
exercise
and
prescribed
a
walk
of
two
hours
every
day
before
dinner
a
rule
to
which
i
attended
regularly
and
to
which
i
ascribe
the
continuance
of
good
general
health
i
shewed
mr
peacock
a
manuscript
book
which
contained
a
number
of
original
propositions
which
i
had
investigated
these
much
increased
my
reputation
i
really
had
sense
enough
to
set
no
particular
value
on
it
and
i
was
soon
known
by
sight
to
almost
everybody
in
the
university
a
ridiculous
little
circumstance
aided
in
this
the
former
rule
of
the
university
strictly
enforced
had
been
that
all
students
should
wear
drab
and
i
at
mr
recommendation
was
so
fitted
up
the
struggle
between
the
old
dress
and
the
trowsers
customary
in
society
was
still
going
on
but
almost
terminated
and
i
was
one
of
the
very
few
freshmen
who
retained
the
old
habiliments
this
made
me
in
some
measure
distinguishable
however
at
the
end
of
my
first
three
terms
i
laid
these
aside
the
college
lectures
began
on
mr
evans
at
on
the
hippolytus
and
mr
peacock
at
on
euclid
these
being
the
assistant
tutors
on
mr
hustler
side
and
then
i
felt
myself
established
i
wrote
in
a
day
or
two
to
my
uncle
arthur
biddell
and
i
received
from
him
a
letter
of
the
utmost
kindness
he
entered
gravely
on
the
consideration
of
my
prospects
my
wants
and
offered
at
all
times
to
furnish
me
with
money
which
he
thought
my
father
parsimonious
habits
might
make
him
unwilling
to
do
i
never
had
occasion
to
avail
myself
of
this
offer
but
it
was
made
in
a
way
which
in
no
small
degree
strengthened
the
kindly
feelings
that
had
long
existed
between
us
i
carefully
attended
the
lectures
taking
notes
as
appeared
necessary
in
mathematics
there
were
geometrical
problems
algebra
trigonometry
which
latter
subjects
the
lectures
did
not
reach
till
the
terms
of
mr
peacock
gave
me
a
copy
of
differential
calculus
as
translated
by
himself
and
herschel
and
babbage
and
also
a
copy
of
their
examples
at
this
time
the
use
of
differential
calculus
was
just
prevailing
over
that
of
fluxions
which
i
had
learnt
i
betook
myself
to
it
with
great
industry
i
also
made
myself
master
of
the
theories
of
rectangular
coordinates
and
some
of
the
differential
processes
applying
to
them
which
only
a
few
of
the
best
of
the
university
mathematicians
then
wholly
possessed
in
classical
subjects
i
read
the
latin
seneca
and
english
hippolytus
racine
phèdre
which
my
sister
translated
for
me
and
all
other
books
to
which
i
was
referred
aristotle
longinus
horace
bentley
dawes
made
verse
translations
of
the
greek
hippolytus
and
was
constantly
on
the
watch
to
read
what
might
be
advantageous
early
in
december
mr
hustler
sent
for
me
to
say
that
one
of
the
company
of
fishmongers
mr
sharp
had
given
to
mr
john
smyth
for
norwich
the
presentation
to
a
small
exhibition
of
a
year
which
mr
smyth
had
placed
in
mr
hustler
hands
and
which
mr
hustler
immediately
conferred
on
me
this
was
my
first
step
towards
pecuniary
independence
i
retained
this
exhibition
till
i
became
a
fellow
of
the
college
i
stayed
at
cambridge
during
part
of
the
winter
vacation
and
to
avoid
expense
i
quitted
my
lodgings
and
went
for
a
time
into
somebody
rooms
in
the
bishop
hostel
it
is
customary
for
the
tutors
to
place
students
in
rooms
when
their
right
owners
are
absent
i
took
with
me
thucydides
and
all
relating
to
it
and
read
the
book
upon
which
the
next
term
lectures
were
to
be
founded
very
carefully
the
latter
part
of
the
vacation
i
spent
at
bury
where
i
began
with
the
assistance
of
my
sister
to
pick
up
a
little
french
as
i
perceived
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
enabling
me
to
read
modern
mathematics
during
a
part
of
the
time
i
employed
myself
in
writing
out
a
paper
on
the
geometrical
interpretation
of
the
algebraical
expression
sqrt
i
think
that
the
original
suggestion
of
perpendicular
line
came
from
some
book
i
do
not
remember
clearly
and
i
worked
it
out
in
several
instances
pretty
well
especially
in
de
moivre
theorem
i
had
spoken
of
it
in
the
preceding
term
to
mr
peacock
and
he
encouraged
me
to
work
it
out
the
date
at
the
end
is
january
when
some
time
afterwards
i
spoke
of
it
to
mr
hustler
he
disapproved
of
my
employing
my
time
on
such
speculations
about
the
last
day
of
january
i
returned
to
cambridge
taking
up
my
abode
in
my
former
lodgings
i
shewed
my
paper
on
sqrt
to
mr
peacock
who
was
much
pleased
with
it
and
shewed
it
to
mr
whewell
and
others
on
february
i
commenced
two
excellent
customs
the
first
was
that
i
always
had
upon
my
table
a
quire
of
sewn
together
and
upon
this
paper
everything
was
entered
translations
into
latin
and
out
of
greek
mathematical
problems
memoranda
of
every
kind
the
latter
transferred
when
necessary
to
the
subsequent
pages
and
generally
with
the
date
of
the
day
this
is
a
most
valuable
custom
the
other
was
this
as
i
perceived
that
to
write
latin
prose
well
would
be
useful
to
me
i
wrote
a
translation
of
english
into
latin
every
day
however
much
pressed
i
might
be
with
other
business
i
endeavoured
to
write
at
least
three
or
four
words
but
if
possible
i
wrote
a
good
many
sentences
i
may
fix
upon
this
as
the
time
when
my
daily
habits
were
settled
in
the
form
in
which
they
continued
for
several
years
i
rose
in
time
for
the
chapel
service
at
it
was
the
college
regulation
that
every
student
should
attend
chapel
four
mornings
and
four
evenings
sunday
being
one
of
each
in
every
week
and
in
this
i
never
failed
after
chapel
service
i
came
to
my
lodgings
and
breakfasted
at
i
went
to
college
lectures
which
lasted
to
most
of
my
contemporaries
being
intended
for
the
church
attended
also
divinity
lectures
but
i
never
did
i
then
returned
put
my
lecture
notes
in
order
wrote
my
piece
of
latin
prose
and
then
employed
myself
on
the
subject
which
i
was
reading
for
the
time
usually
taking
mathematics
at
this
hour
at
or
a
little
sooner
i
went
out
for
a
long
walk
usually
or
miles
into
the
country
sometimes
if
i
found
companions
i
rowed
on
the
cam
a
practice
acquired
rather
later
a
little
before
i
returned
and
at
went
to
college
hall
after
dinner
i
lounged
till
evening
chapel
time
past
and
returning
about
i
then
had
tea
then
i
read
quietly
usually
a
classical
subject
till
and
i
never
even
in
the
times
when
i
might
seem
most
severely
pressed
sat
up
later
from
this
time
to
the
close
of
the
annual
examination
beginning
of
june
i
remained
at
cambridge
stopping
there
through
the
easter
vacation
the
subjects
of
the
mathematical
lectures
were
ordinary
algebra
and
trigonometry
but
mr
peacock
always
had
some
private
problems
of
a
higher
class
for
me
and
saw
me
i
believe
every
day
the
subjects
of
the
classical
lectures
were
the
termination
of
hippolytus
the
book
of
thucydides
and
the
oration
of
cicero
in
mathematics
i
read
whewell
mechanics
then
just
published
the
first
innovation
made
in
the
cambridge
system
of
physical
sciences
for
many
years
and
i
find
in
my
notes
integrals
central
forces
finite
differences
constructions
and
powers
plans
of
bridges
spherical
trigonometry
optical
calculations
relating
to
the
achromatism
of
and
achromatic
with
lenses
separated
mechanical
problems
transit
of
venus
various
problems
in
geometrical
astronomy
i
think
it
was
at
this
time
that
mr
peacock
had
given
me
a
copy
of
woodhouse
astronomy
edition
the
rainbow
plans
for
anemometer
and
for
a
machine
clearing
lunars
with
a
great
number
of
geometrical
problems
i
remark
that
my
ideas
on
the
differential
calculus
had
not
acquired
on
some
important
points
the
severe
accuracy
which
they
acquired
in
a
few
months
in
classics
i
read
the
persae
of
aeschylus
greek
and
roman
history
very
much
mitford
hooke
ferguson
and
the
books
of
thucydides
introductory
to
that
of
the
lecture
subject
the
and
attended
to
chronology
on
the
are
from
euripides
careful
from
thucydides
maps
notes
on
points
of
grammar
i
have
also
little
books
with
abundant
notes
on
all
these
subjects
i
usually
made
a
little
book
when
i
pursued
any
subject
in
a
regular
way
on
may
mr
dobree
the
head
lecturer
sent
for
me
to
say
that
he
appointed
me
sizar
for
the
next
year
the
stipend
of
this
office
was
a
sum
upon
which
i
set
considerable
value
in
my
anxiety
for
pecuniary
independence
but
it
was
also
gratifying
to
me
as
shewing
the
way
in
which
i
was
regarded
by
the
college
authorities
on
wednesday
may
the
examination
began
i
was
anxious
about
the
result
of
the
examination
but
only
in
such
a
degree
as
to
make
my
conduct
perfectly
steady
and
calm
and
to
prevent
me
from
attempting
any
extraordinary
exertion
when
the
classes
were
published
the
first
class
of
the
year
alphabetically
arranged
as
is
the
custom
stood
thus
airy
boileau
childers
drinkwater
field
iliff
malkin
myers
romilly
strutt
tate
winning
it
was
soon
known
however
that
i
was
first
of
the
class
it
was
generally
expected
and
certainly
by
me
that
considering
how
great
a
preponderance
the
classics
were
understood
in
the
known
system
of
the
college
to
have
in
determining
the
order
of
merit
field
would
be
first
however
the
number
of
marks
which
field
obtained
was
about
and
that
which
i
obtained
about
no
other
competitor
i
believe
was
near
us
in
a
letter
to
airy
from
his
college
tutor
mr
hustler
there
is
the
following
passage
it
is
a
matter
of
extreme
satisfaction
to
me
that
in
the
late
examination
you
stood
not
only
in
the
first
class
but
first
of
the
first
i
trust
that
your
future
exertions
and
success
will
be
commensurate
with
this
honourable
beginning
of
the
men
whom
i
have
named
drinkwater
bethune
was
afterwards
legal
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
india
field
was
afterwards
rector
of
reepham
romilly
afterwards
lord
romilly
became
strutt
afterwards
lord
belper
became
for
derby
and
first
commissioner
of
railways
tate
was
afterwards
master
of
richmond
endowed
school
childers
was
the
father
of
childers
who
was
subsequently
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
i
returned
to
bury
immediately
while
there
some
students
some
of
them
men
about
to
take
their
degree
at
the
next
january
applied
to
me
to
take
them
as
pupils
but
i
declined
this
year
of
my
life
enabled
me
to
understand
how
i
stood
among
men
i
returned
to
cambridge
about
july
as
a
general
rule
undergraduates
are
not
allowed
to
reside
in
the
university
during
the
long
vacation
i
believe
that
before
i
left
after
the
examination
i
had
made
out
that
i
should
be
permitted
to
reside
or
i
wrote
to
mr
hustler
i
applied
to
mr
hustler
to
be
lodged
in
rooms
in
college
and
was
put
first
into
rooms
in
bishop
hostel
and
subsequently
into
rooms
in
the
great
court
the
first
affair
that
i
had
in
college
was
one
of
disappointment
by
no
means
deserving
the
importance
which
it
assumed
in
my
thoughts
i
had
been
entered
a
sizar
but
as
the
list
of
foundation
sizars
was
full
my
dinners
in
hall
were
paid
for
some
vacancies
had
arisen
and
as
these
were
to
be
filled
up
in
order
of
merit
i
expected
one
and
in
my
desire
for
pecuniary
independence
i
wished
for
it
very
earnestly
however
as
in
theory
all
of
the
first
class
were
equal
and
as
there
were
some
sizars
in
it
senior
in
entrance
to
me
they
obtained
places
first
and
i
was
not
actually
appointed
till
after
the
next
scholarship
examination
easter
however
a
special
arrangement
was
made
allowing
me
i
forget
whether
others
to
sit
at
the
table
whenever
any
of
the
number
was
absent
and
in
consequence
i
received
practically
nearly
the
full
benefits
mr
peacock
who
was
going
out
for
the
vacation
allowed
me
access
to
his
books
i
had
also
by
the
assistance
of
various
fellows
who
all
treated
me
with
great
kindness
almost
to
a
degree
of
respect
command
of
the
university
library
and
trinity
library
and
spent
this
long
vacation
like
several
others
very
happily
indeed
the
only
subjects
of
the
next
examination
were
the
gospel
of
st
luke
paley
evidences
and
paley
moral
and
political
philosophy
thus
my
time
was
left
more
free
to
mathematics
and
to
general
classics
than
last
year
i
now
began
a
custom
which
i
maintained
for
some
years
generally
i
read
mathematics
in
the
morning
and
classics
for
lectures
in
the
afternoon
but
invariably
i
began
at
in
the
evening
to
read
with
the
utmost
severity
some
standard
classics
unconnected
with
the
lectures
and
at
precisely
i
left
off
and
went
to
bed
i
continued
my
daily
translations
into
latin
prose
as
before
on
august
rosser
a
man
of
my
own
year
engaged
me
as
private
tutor
paying
at
the
usual
rate
for
a
part
of
the
vacation
and
for
a
term
and
immediately
afterwards
his
friend
bedingfield
did
the
same
this
occupied
two
hours
every
day
and
i
felt
that
i
was
now
completely
earning
my
own
living
i
never
received
a
penny
from
my
friends
after
this
time
i
find
on
my
various
words
which
shew
that
in
reading
poisson
i
was
struggling
with
french
words
there
are
also
finite
differences
and
their
calculus
figure
of
the
earth
force
to
the
center
various
attractions
some
evidently
referring
to
maclaurin
integrals
conic
sections
kepler
problem
analytical
geometry
theorem
spherical
aberration
rotations
round
three
axes
apparently
i
had
been
reading
euler
floating
bodies
evolute
of
ellipse
newton
treatment
of
the
moon
variation
i
attempted
to
extract
something
from
vince
astronomy
on
the
physical
explanation
of
precession
but
in
despair
of
understanding
it
and
having
made
out
an
explanation
for
myself
by
the
motion
round
three
axes
i
put
together
a
little
treatise
which
with
some
corrections
and
additions
was
afterwards
printed
in
my
mathematical
tracts
on
i
bought
woodhouse
physical
astronomy
and
this
was
quite
an
epoch
in
my
mathematical
knowledge
first
i
was
compelled
by
the
process
of
changing
the
independent
variable
to
examine
severely
the
logic
of
the
differential
calculus
secondly
i
was
now
able
to
enter
on
the
theory
of
perturbations
which
for
several
years
had
been
the
desired
land
to
me
at
the
fellowship
election
of
sydney
walker
among
other
persons
was
elected
fellow
he
then
quitted
the
rooms
in
which
he
had
lived
almost
the
worst
in
the
college
and
i
immediately
took
them
they
suited
me
well
and
i
lived
very
happily
in
them
till
i
was
elected
scholar
they
are
small
rooms
above
the
middle
staircase
on
the
south
side
of
neville
court
mr
peacock
rooms
were
on
the
same
staircase
i
had
access
to
the
leads
on
the
roof
of
the
building
from
one
of
my
windows
this
was
before
the
new
court
was
built
my
best
window
looked
upon
the
garden
of
the
college
butler
i
had
brought
to
cambridge
the
telescope
which
i
had
made
at
colchester
and
about
this
time
i
had
a
stand
made
by
a
carpenter
at
cambridge
and
i
find
repeated
observations
of
jupiter
and
saturn
made
in
this
october
term
other
mathematical
subjects
on
my
are
geometrical
astronomy
barometers
for
elevations
maclaurin
figure
of
the
earth
lagrange
theorem
integrals
differential
equations
of
the
second
order
particular
solutions
in
general
mathematics
i
had
much
discussion
with
atkinson
who
was
senior
wrangler
january
and
in
physics
with
rosser
who
was
a
friend
of
sir
richard
phillips
a
vain
objector
to
gravitation
in
classics
i
read
aeschylus
and
herodotus
on
october
i
received
notice
from
the
head
lecturer
to
declaim
in
english
with
winning
this
exercise
consists
in
preparing
a
controversial
essay
learning
it
by
heart
and
speaking
it
in
chapel
after
the
thursday
evening
service
on
october
we
agreed
on
the
subject
is
natural
difference
to
be
ascribed
to
moral
or
to
physical
causes
i
taking
the
latter
side
i
spoke
the
declamation
reciting
it
without
missing
a
word
on
october
on
october
i
received
notice
of
latin
declamation
with
myers
subject
agreed
on
utrum
civitati
plus
utilitatis
an
incommodi
afferant
leges
quae
ad
vitas
privatorum
hominum
ordinandas
pertinent
i
took
the
former
the
declamation
was
recited
on
november
when
a
curious
circumstance
occurred
my
declamation
was
rather
long
it
was
the
first
saturday
of
the
term
on
which
a
declamation
had
been
spoken
and
it
was
the
day
on
which
arrived
the
news
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
bill
of
pains
and
penalties
against
queen
caroline
this
trial
had
been
going
on
through
the
summer
but
i
knew
little
about
it
in
consequence
the
impatience
of
the
undergraduates
was
very
great
and
there
was
such
an
uproar
of
coughing
in
the
chapel
as
probably
was
never
known
the
master
dr
wordsworth
appointed
in
the
beginning
of
the
summer
on
the
death
of
dr
mansell
and
to
whom
i
had
been
indirectly
introduced
by
mrs
clarkson
and
tutors
and
deans
tried
in
vain
to
stop
the
hubbub
however
i
went
on
steadily
to
the
end
not
at
all
frightened
on
the
monday
the
master
sent
for
me
to
make
a
sort
of
apology
in
the
name
of
the
authorities
and
letters
to
the
tutors
were
read
at
the
lectures
and
on
the
whole
the
transaction
was
nowise
disagreeable
to
me
on
the
commemoration
day
december
i
received
my
prize
mitford
greece
as
man
after
dinner
in
the
college
hall
after
a
short
vacation
spent
at
bury
and
playford
i
returned
to
cambridge
walking
from
bury
on
during
the
next
term
i
find
in
mathematics
partial
differential
equations
tides
sound
calculus
of
variations
composition
of
rotary
motions
motion
in
resisting
medium
lhuillier
theorem
brightness
of
an
object
as
seen
through
a
medium
with
any
possible
law
of
refraction
a
good
investigation
numerical
calculations
connected
with
them
equilibrium
of
chain
under
centripetal
force
geometrically
treated
as
an
improvement
upon
whewell
algebraical
method
investigation
of
the
magnitude
of
attractive
forces
of
glass
required
to
produce
refraction
i
forget
about
mathematical
lectures
but
i
have
an
impression
that
i
regularly
attended
mr
lectures
and
that
he
always
set
me
some
private
problems
i
attended
mr
evans
lectures
on
st
luke
and
i
find
many
notes
about
the
history
of
the
jews
cerinthus
and
various
heresies
moral
philosophy
paley
evidences
and
biblical
maps
also
speculations
about
ancient
pronunciations
for
a
week
or
more
before
the
annual
examination
i
was
perfectly
lazy
the
classes
of
my
year
junior
sophs
were
not
published
till
june
it
was
soon
known
that
i
was
first
with
marks
the
next
being
drinkwater
with
marks
after
a
short
holiday
at
bury
and
playford
i
returned
to
cambridge
on
july
my
daily
life
went
on
as
usual
i
find
that
in
writing
latin
i
began
cicero
de
senectute
retranslating
melmoth
translation
and
comparing
some
time
in
the
long
vacation
the
names
of
the
prizemen
for
declamations
were
published
i
was
disappointed
that
not
one
english
or
latin
was
assigned
to
me
but
it
was
foolish
for
my
declamations
were
rather
trumpery
my
former
pupil
rosser
came
again
on
august
on
august
dr
blomfield
afterwards
bishop
of
london
called
to
engage
me
as
tutor
to
his
brother
george
beecher
blomfield
and
he
commenced
attendance
on
with
these
two
pupils
i
finished
at
the
end
of
the
long
vacation
for
the
next
three
terms
i
had
one
pupil
gibson
a
newcastle
man
recommended
by
mr
peacock
i
believe
as
a
personal
friend
mr
peacock
being
of
durham
the
only
classical
subject
appointed
for
the
next
examination
was
the
and
books
of
the
odyssey
the
mathematical
subjects
all
the
applied
mathematics
and
newton
there
was
to
be
however
the
scholarship
examination
sizars
being
allowed
to
sit
for
scholarships
only
in
their
year
and
the
scholarship
being
a
kind
of
little
fellowship
necessary
to
qualify
for
being
a
candidate
for
the
real
fellowship
when
the
october
term
began
mr
hustler
who
usually
gave
lectures
in
mathematics
to
his
pupils
said
to
me
that
it
was
not
worth
my
while
to
attend
his
lectures
and
he
or
mr
peacock
suggested
that
drinkwater
myers
and
i
should
attend
the
examinations
the
questionists
are
those
who
are
to
take
the
degree
of
in
the
next
january
and
it
was
customary
not
to
give
them
lectures
but
three
times
a
week
to
examine
them
by
setting
mathematical
questions
as
the
best
method
of
preparing
for
the
examination
accordingly
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
attend
the
said
examinations
but
when
we
went
the
questionists
of
that
year
refused
to
attend
they
were
reported
to
be
a
weak
year
and
we
to
be
a
strong
one
and
they
were
disposed
to
take
offence
at
us
on
any
occasion
from
some
of
the
scholars
of
our
year
who
sat
at
table
with
scholars
of
that
year
i
heard
that
they
distinguished
us
as
impudent
year
annus
mirabilis
on
this
occasion
they
pretended
to
believe
that
the
plan
of
our
attendance
at
the
questionists
examinations
had
been
suggested
by
an
undergraduate
and
no
explanation
was
of
the
least
use
so
the
tutors
agreed
not
to
press
the
matter
on
them
and
instead
of
it
drinkwater
myers
and
i
went
three
times
a
week
to
mr
peacock
rooms
and
he
set
us
questions
i
think
that
this
system
was
also
continued
during
the
next
two
terms
ending
in
june
or
part
of
them
but
i
am
not
certain
in
august
i
copied
out
a
on
optics
i
think
from
mr
whewell
on
august
one
on
the
figure
of
the
earth
and
tides
and
at
some
other
time
one
on
the
motion
of
a
body
round
two
centers
of
force
both
from
mr
whewell
on
my
scribbling
paper
i
find
a
problem
on
the
vibrations
of
a
gig
as
depending
on
the
horse
step
like
that
of
a
pendulum
whose
support
is

in
september
i
had
my
old
telescope
mounted
on
a
short
tripod
stand
and
made
experiments
on
its
adjustments
i
was
possessed
of
white
ephemeris
and
i
find
observations
of
jupiter
and
saturn
in
october
i
planned
an
engine
for
describing
ellipses
by
the
polar
equation
e
cos
theta
and
tried
to
make
a
micrometer
with
silk
threads
converging
to
a
point
mr
cubitt
called
on
and
he
was
engaged
in
erecting
a
treadmill
at
cambridge
gaol
and
had
some
thoughts
of
sending
plans
for
the
cambridge
observatory
the
erection
of
which
was
then
proposed
on
i
find
that
i
had
received
from
cubitt
a
nautical
almanac
the
first
that
i
had
on
i
made
some
experiments
with
drinkwater
i
think
it
was
whirling
a
glass
containing
oil
on
water
in
classics
i
was
chiefly
engaged
upon
thucydides
and
homer
on
october
i
had
a
letter
from
charles
musgrave
introducing
challis
who
succeeded
me
in
the
cambridge
observatory
in
at
this
time
my
poor
afflicted
father
was
suffering
much
from
a
severe
form
of
rheumatism
or
pain
in
the
legs
which
sometimes
prevented
him
from
going
to
bed
for
weeks
together
on
the
commemoration
day
i
received
my
prize
as
man
in
hall
again
the
next
day
i
walked
to
bury
and
passed
the
winter
vacation
there
and
at
playford
i
returned
to
cambridge
on
on
i
kept
my
first
act
with
great
compliments
from
the
moderator
and
with
a
most
unusually
large
attendance
of
auditors
these
disputations
on
mathematics
in
latin
are
now
discontinued
on
march
i
kept
a
first
opponency
against
sandys
about
this
time
i
received
buckle
a
trinity
man
of
my
own
year
who
was
generally
supposed
to
come
next
after
drinkwater
as
pupil
on
my
sheets
i
find
integrals
and
differential
equations
of
every
kind
astronomical
corrections
of
which
i
prepared
a
book

on
apr
i
intended
to
write
an
account
of
my
eye
i
was
then
tormented
with
a
double
image
i
suppose
from
some
disease
of
the
stomach
and
on
may
i
find
by
a
drawing
of
the
appearance
of
a
lamp
that
the
disease
of
my
eye
continued
on
i
gave
mr
peacock
a
paper
on
the
alteration
of
the
focal
length
of
a
telescope
as
directed
with
or
against
the
earth
orbital
motion
on
the
theory
of
emissions
which
was
written
out
for
reading
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
on
and
this
society
i
think
was
then
about
a
year
old
on
my
on
precession
solar
inequality
and
nutation
was
made
complete
the
important
examination
for
scholarships
was
now
approaching
as
i
have
said
this
one
opportunity
only
was
given
to
sizars
pensioners
having
always
two
opportunities
and
sometimes
three
and
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
scholar
in
order
to
be
competent
to
be
a
candidate
for
a
fellowship
on
apr
i
addressed
my
formal
latin
letter
to
the
seniors
there
were
vacancies
and
candidates
the
election
took
place
on
apr
i
was
by
much
the
first
which
i
hardly
expected
and
was
complimented
by
the
master
and
others
wrote
the
formal
letter
of
thanks
as
usual
i
was
now
entitled
to
claim
better
rooms
and
i
took
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
on
the
east
side
of
the
queen
gate
of
the
great
court
even
now
i
think
of
my
quiet
residence
in
the
little
rooms
above
the
staircase
in
neville
court
with
great
pleasure
i
took
possession
of
my
new
rooms
on
may
the
annual
examination
began
on
may
the
classes
were
published
on
june
when
my
name
was
separated
from
the
rest
by
two
lines
it
was
understood
that
the
second
man
was
drinkwater
and
that
my
number
of
marks
was
very
nearly
double
of
his
having
at
this
time
been
disappointed
of
a
proposed
walking
excursion
into
derbyshire
with
a
college
friend
who
failed
me
at
the
last
moment
i
walked
to
bury
and
spent
a
short
holiday
there
and
at
playford
i
returned
to
cambridge
on
july
i
was
steadily
busy
during
this
long
vacation
but
by
no
means
oppressively
so
indeed
my
time
passed
very
happily
the
scholars
table
is
the
only
one
in
college
at
which
the
regular
possessors
of
the
table
are
sure
never
to
see
a
stranger
and
thus
a
sort
of
family
intimacy
grows
up
among
the
scholars
moreover
the
scholars
feel
themselves
to
be
a
privileged
class
the
foundation
and
this
feeling
gives
them
a
sort
of
conceited
happiness
it
was
the
duty
of
scholars
by
turns
to
read
grace
after
the
fellows
dinner
and
supper
and
at
this
time
i
know
it
by
heart
they
also
read
the
lessons
in
chapel
on
week
days
but
as
there
was
no
daily
during
the
summer
vacation
i
had
not
much
of
this
in
the
intimacy
of
which
i
speak
i
became
much
acquainted
with
drinkwater
buckle
rothman
and
sutcliffe
and
we
formed
a
knot
at
the
table
first
the
undergraduate
scholars
table
and
afterwards
the
bachelor
scholars
table
for
several
years
during
this
vacation
i
had
for
pupils
buckle
and
gibson
i
wrote
my
daily
latin
as
usual
beginning
with
the
retranslation
of
cicero
epistles
but
i
interrupted
it
from
to
i
believe
it
was
in
this
vacation
or
in
the
october
term
that
i
began
every
evening
to
read
thucydides
very
carefully
as
my
notes
are
marked
and
on
august
i
find
that
i
was
reading
fasti
in

i
find

one
on
tides
one
on
newton
principia
with
algebraical
additions
on
and
there
are
lunar
distances
observed
with
rothman
sextant
and
completely
worked
out
for
these
i
prepared
a
printed
skeleton
form
i
believe
my
first
on
december
there
are
references
to
books
on
geology
conybeare
and
phillips
and
parkinson
which
i
was
beginning
to
study
on
july
being
the
day
on
which
i
completed
my
year
i
carefully
did
nothing
another
subject
partly
occupied
my
thoughts
which
though
not
with
reference
to
practical
science
very
wise
yet
gave
me
some
cambridge
celebrity
in
july
i
had
as
before
mentioned
sketched
a
plan
for
constructing
reflecting
telescopes
with
silvered
glass
and
had
shewn
it
afterwards
to
mr
peacock
i
now
completed
the
theory
of
this
construction
by
correcting
the
aberrations
spherical
as
well
as
chromatic
on
july
i
drew
up
a
paper
about
it
for
mr
peacock
he
approved
it
much
and
in
some
way
communicated
it
to
mr
afterwards
sir
john
herschel
i
was
soon
after
introduced
to
herschel
at
a
breakfast
with
mr
peacock
and
he
approved
of
the
scheme
generally
on
august
i
drew
up
a
complete
mathematical
paper
for
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
which
i
entrusted
to
mr
peacock
the
aberrations
both
spherical
and
chromatic
are
here
worked
out
very
well
on
it
was
read
at
the
meeting
of
the
philosophical
society
and
was
afterwards
printed
in
their
transactions
this
was
my
first
printed
memoir
before
this
time
however
i
had
arranged
to
try
the
scheme
practically
mr
peacock
had
engaged
to
bear
the
expense
but
i
had
no
occasion
to
ask
him
partly
i
think
through
drinkwater
i
communicated
with
an
optician
named
bancks
in
the
strand
who
constructed
the
optical
part
i
subsequently
tried
my
telescope
but
it
would
not
do
the
fault
as
i
had
not
and
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
depends
in
some
way
on
the
crystallization
of
the
mercury
silvering
it
must
have
been
about
this
time
that
i
was
introduced
to
mr
afterwards
sir
james
south
at
a
party
at
mr
peacock
rooms
he
advised
me
to
write
to
tulley
a
practical
optician
who
made
me
some
new
reflectors
so
that
i
had
two
specimens
one
gregorian
the
other
cassegrainian
however
the
thing
failed
practically
and
i
was
too
busy
ever
after
to
try
it
again
during
the
october
term
i
had
no
pupils
i
kept
my
second
act
on
opponents
hamilton
rusby
field
and
an
opponency
against
jeffries
on
i
attended
the
questionists
examinations
i
seem
to
have
lived
a
very
comfortable
idle
life
the
commemoration
day
was
when
i
received
a
prize
and
the
next
day
i
walked
to
bury
on
i
returned
to
cambridge
and
until
the
examination
i
read
novels
and
played
cards
more
than
at
any
other
time
in
college
on
thursday
the
preliminary
classes
for
arrangement
of
details
of
the
examination
were
published
the
first
class

as
far
as
i
remember
the
rule
was
then
that
on
certain
days
the
classes
were
grouped
in
regard
to
identity
of
questions
given
to
each
group
thus
and
on
certain
other
days
thus
on
saturday
i
paid
fees
on
monday
the
proceedings
of
examination
began
by
a
breakfast
in
the
combination
room
after
this
gibson
gave
me
breakfast
every
day
and
buckle
gave
me
and
some
others
a
glass
of
wine
after
dinner
the
hours
were
sharp
the
season
a
cold
one
and
no
fire
was
allowed
in
the
senate
house
where
the
examination
was
carried
on
my
place
was
in
the
east
gallery
and
altogether
it
was
a
severe
time
the
course
of
examination
was
as
follows
monday
to

we
went

but
there
seems
to
have
been
little
serious
examination
friday
on

on

the

were
conferred
in
the
usual

it
had
been
arranged
that
my
brother
and
sister
should
come
to
see
me
take
my
degree
of
and
i
had
asked
gibson
to
conduct
them
to
the
senate

but
mr
hawkes
a
trinity
fellow
found
them
and
stationed
them
at
the
upper
end
of
the
senate
house
after
the
preliminary
arrangements
of
papers
at
the
table
i
as
senior
wrangler
was
led
up
first
to
receive
the
degree
and
rarely
has
the
senate
house
rung
with
such
applause
as
then
filled
it
for
many
minutes
after
i
was
brought
in
front
of
the
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
with
the
ceremony
on
account
of
the
uproar
i
gave
notice
to
the
smith
prize
electors
of
my
intention
to
for
that
prize
and
dined
at
rothman
rooms
with
drinkwater
buckle
and
others
on
monday
i
was
examined
by
professor
woodhouse
for
smith
prize
from
to
i
think
that
the
only
competitor
was
jeffries
on
tuesday
i
was
examined
by
turton
to
and
on
wednesday
by
lax
to
on
thursday
i
went
to
bury
by
coach
on
one
of
the
coldest
evenings
that
i
ever
felt
mr
peacock
had
once
recommended
me
to
sit
for
the
chancellor
medal
classical
prize
but
he
now
seemed
to
be
cool
in
his
advice
and
i
laid
aside
all
thought
of
it
it
seems
not
out
of
place
to
insert
here
a
copy
of
some
cambridge
reminiscences
written
by
airy
which
will
serve
to
explain
the
acts
and
opponencies
referred
to
in
the
previous
narrative
and
other
matters
the
acts
the
examination
for
degrees
was
preceded
in
my
time
by
keeping
two
acts
in
the
schools
under
the
university
library
the
second
of
them
in
the
october
term
immediately
before
the
examination
the
first
i
think
in
the
october
term
of
the
preceding
year
these
acts
were
reliques
of
the
disputations
of
the
middle
ages
which
probably
held
a
very
important
place
in
the
discipline
of
the
university
there
seems
to
be
something
like
them
in
some
of
the
continental
universities
the
presiding
authority
was
one
of
the
moderators
i
apprehend
that
the
word
moderator
signified
president
in
which
sense
it
is
still
used
in
the
kirk
of
scotland
and
that
it
was
peculiarly
applied
to
the
presidency
of
the
disputations
the
most
important
educational
arrangement
in
the
university
the
moderator
sent
a
summons
to
the
respondent
to
submit
three
subjects
for
argument
and
to
prepare
to
defend
them
on
a
given
day
he
also
named
three
opponents
this
and
all
the
following
proceedings
were
conducted
in
latin
for
my
act
of
i
submitted
the
following
subjects
recte
statuit
newtonus
in
principiis
suis
mathematicis
libro
primo
sectione
undecimâ
recte
statuit
woodius
de
iride
recte
statuit
paleius
de
obligationibus
the
opponents
named
to
attack
these
assertions
were
hamilton
of
st
john
rusby
of
st
catharine
field
of
trinity
it
was
customary
for
the
opponents
to
meet
at
tea
at
the
rooms
of
the
senior
opponent
in
order
to
discuss
and
arrange
their
arguments
the
respondent
was
also
invited
but
he
was
warned
that
he
must
depart
as
soon
as
tea
would
be
finished
then
the
three
opponents
proceeded
with
their
occupation
as
i
have
acted
in
both
capacities
i
am
able
to
say
that
the
matter
was
transacted
in
an
earnest
and
way
indeed
in
the
time
preceding
my
own
i
know
not
whether
in
my
own
time
the
assistance
of
a
private
tutor
was
frequently
engaged
and
i
remember
hearing
a
senior
remark
that
my
college
tutor
james
hustler
was
the
best
crammer
for
an
act
in
the
university
at
the
appointed
time
the
parties
met
in
the
schools
the
respondent
first
read
a
latin
thesis
on
any
subject
i
think
i
took
some
metaphysical
subject
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
it
then
the
respondent
read
his
first
dogma
and
the
first
opponent
produced
an
argument
against
it
in
latin
after
this
there
were
repeated
replies
and
rejoinders
all
in
vivâ
voce
latin
the
moderator
sometimes
interposing
a
remark
in
latin
when
he
considered
that
one
argument
was
disposed
of
he
called
for
another
by
the
words
probes
aliter
the
arguments
were
sometimes
shaped
with
considerable
ingenuity
and
required
a
clear
head
in
the
respondent
when
all
was
finished
the
moderator
made
a
complimentary
remark
to
the
respondent
and
one
to
the
first
opponent
i
forget
whether
to
the
second
and
third
in
my
respondency
of
november
the
compliment
was
quaestiones
tuas
summo
ingenio
et
acumine
defendisti
et
in
rebus
mathematicis
scientiam
planè
mirabilem
ostendisti
in
an
opponency
i
forget
when
the
compliment
was
magno
ingenio
argumenta
tua
et
construxisti
et
defendisti
the
acts
of
the
high
men
excited
much
interest
among
the
students
at
my
acts
the
room
was
crowded
with
undergraduates
i
imagine
that
at
a
time
somewhat
distant
the
maintenance
of
the
acts
was
the
only
regulation
by
which
the
university
acted
on
the
studies
of
the
place
when
the
acts
had
been
properly
kept
license
was
given
to
the
father
of
the
college
to
present
the
undergraduate
to
the
who
then
solemnly
admitted
him
ad
respondendum
quaestioni
there
is
no
appearance
of
collective
examination
before
this
presentation
what
the
quaestio
might
be
i
do
not
know
still
the
undergraduate
was
not
the
quaestio
however
was
finished
and
approved
before
the
day
of
a
certain
congregation
and
then
the
undergraduate
was
declared
to
be
actualiter
in
artibus
baccalaureum
probably
these
regulations
were
found
to
be
insufficient
for
the
control
of
education
and
the
january
examination
was
instituted
i
conjecture
this
to
have
been
at
or
shortly
before
the
date
of
the
earliest
triposes
recorded
in
the
cambridge
calendar
the
increasing
importance
of
the
january
examination
naturally
diminished
the
value
of
the
acts
in
the
eyes
of
the
undergraduates
and
a
few
years
after
my
degree
it
was
found
that
the
opponents
met
not
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
their
arguments
from
the
respondent
but
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
them
to
him
this
led
to
the
entire
suppression
of
the
system
the
most
active
man
in
this
suppression
was
mr
whewell
its
date
must
have
been
near
to
the
shape
in
which
the
arguments
were
delivered
by
an
opponent
reading
from
a
written
paper
was
si
quoting
something
from
the
respondent
challenge
cadit
quaestio
sed
citing
something
else
bearing
on
the
subject
of
discussion
valet
consequentia
ergo
combining
these
to
prove
some
inaccuracy
in
the
respondent
challenge
valent
consequentia
et
argumentum
nobody
pretended
to
understand
these
mystical
terminations
apparently
the
original
idea
was
that
several
acts
should
be
kept
by
each
undergraduate
for
to
keep
up
the
number
as
it
seemed
each
student
had
to
gabble
through
a
ridiculous
form
si
quaestiones
tuae
falsae
sint
cadit
quaestio
sed
quaestiones
tuae
falsae
sunt
ergo
valent
consequentia
et
argumentum
i
have
forgotten
time
and
place
when
this
was
uttered
the
examination
the
questionists
as
the
undergraduates
preparing
for
were
called
in
the
october
term
were
considered
as
a
separate
body
collected
at
a
separate
table
in
hall
attending
no
lectures
but
invited
to
attend
a
system
of
trial
examinations
conducted
by
one
of
the
tutors
or
from
the
acts
from
the
annual
college
examinations
and
i
suppose
from
enquiries
in
the
separate
colleges
the
moderators
acquired
a
general
idea
of
the
relative
merits
of
the
candidates
for
honours
guided
by
this
the
candidates
were
divided
into
six
classes
the
moderators
and
assistant
examiners
were
provided
each
with
a
set
of
questions
in
manuscript
no
printed
papers
were
used
for
honours
in
the
senate
house
in
regard
to
the
greek
hoi
polloi
i
can
not
say
on
the
monday
on
which
the
examination
began
the
father
of
the
college
received
all
the
questionists
i
believe
at
any
rate
all
the
candidates
for
honours
at
breakfast
in
the
combination
room
at
and
marched
them
to
the
senate
house
my
place
with
other
was
in
the
east
gallery
there
one
examiner
took
charge
of
the
and
classes
united
another
examiner
took
the
and
classes
united
and
a
third
took
the
and
united
on
tuesday
one
examiner
took
the
class
alone
a
second
took
the
and
classes
united
a
third
took
the
and
classes
united
and
a
fourth
took
the
class
alone
on
wednesday
thursday
and
friday
the
changes
were
similar
and
in
all
the
questioning
was
thus
conducted
the
examiner
read
from
his
manuscript
the
first
question
those
who
could
answer
it
proceeded
to
write
out
their
answers
and
as
soon
as
one
had
finished
he
gave
the
word
done
then
the
examiner
read
out
his
second
question
repeating
it
when
necessary
for
the
understanding
by
those
who
took
it
up
more
lately
and
so
on
i
think
that
the
same
process
was
repeated
in
the
afternoon
but
i
do
not
remember
precisely
in
this
manner
the
examination
was
conducted
through
five
days
monday
to
friday
with
no
interruption
except
on
friday
afternoon
it
was
principally
perhaps
entirely
bookwork
but
on
two
there
were
printed
papers
of
problems
and
the
examination
in
these
was
conducted
just
as
in
the
printed
papers
of
the
present
day
but
in
the
private
college
rooms
of
the
moderators
and
there
wine
and
other
refreshments
were
offered
to
the
examinees
how
this
singular
custom
began
i
know
not
the
order
of
merit
was
worked
out
on
friday
afternoon
and
evening
and
was
in
some
measure
known
through
the
university
late
in
the
evening
i
remember
mr
peacock
coming
to
a
party
of
examinees
and
giving
information
on
several
places
i
do
not
remember
his
mentioning
mine
though
undoubtedly
he
did
but
i
distinctly
remember
his
giving
the
wooden
spoon
on
the
saturday
morning
at
the
manuscript
list
was
nailed
to
the
door
of
the
the
form
of
further
proceedings
in
the
presentation
for
degree
ad
respondendum
quaestioni
i
imagine
has
not
been
much
altered
the
kneeling
before
the
and
placing
hands
in
the
hands
were
those
of
the
old
form
of
doing
homage
the
form
of
examination
which
i
have
described
was
complicated
and
perhaps
troublesome
but
i
believe
that
it
was
very
efficient
possibly
more
so
than
the
modern
form
established
i
suppose
at
the
same
time
as
the
abolition
of
the
acts
the
proportion
of
questions
now
answered
to
the
whole
number
set
is
ridiculously
small
and
no
accurate
idea
of
relative
merit
can
be
formed
from
them
the
college
hall
when
i
went
up
in
and
for
several
years
later
the
dinner
was
at
past
there
was
no
supplementary
dinner
for
special
demands
i
think
were
not
invented
even
in
a
plain
social
way
till
about
or
and
not
in
connection
with
the
college
till
some
years
later
some
of
the
senior
fellows
spoke
of
the
time
when
dinner
was
at
and
regretted
the
change
there
was
supper
in
hall
at
i
have
known
it
to
be
attended
by
a
few
undergraduates
when
tired
by
examinations
or
by
evening
walks
and
there
were
always
some
seniors
at
the
upper
table
i
have
occasionally
joined
them
and
have
had
some
very
interesting
conversations
the
supper
was
cold
but
hot
additions
were
made
when
required
one
little
arrangement
amused
me
as
shewing
the
ecclesiastical
character
of
the
college
the
fasts
of
the
church
were
to
be
strictly
kept
and
there
was
to
be
no
dinner
in
hall
it
was
thus
arranged
the
evening
chapel
service
which
was
usually
at
i
think
was
held
at
and
at
the
ordinary
full
meal
was
served
in
hall
but
as
it
followed
the
chapel
attendance
it
was
held
to
be
supper
and
there
was
no
subsequent
meal
there
were
no
chairs
whatever
in
hall
except
the
single
chair
of
the
at
the
head
of
the
table
on
the
dais
and
that
of
the
senior
dean
at
the
table
next
the
east
wall
all
others
sat
on
benches
and
i
have
heard
allusions
to
a
ludicrous
difficulty
which
occurred
when
some
princesses
of
the
royal
family
dined
in
the
hall
and
it
was
a
great
puzzle
how
to
get
them
to
the
right
side
of
the
benches
the
sizars
dined
after
all
the
rest
their
dinner
usually
began
soon
after
for
the
a
separate
dinner
was
provided
as
for
pensioners
but
for
the
foundationists
the
remains
of
the
fellows
dinner
were
brought
down
and
i
think
that
this
provision
was
generally
preferred
to
the
other
the
dishes
at
all
the
tables
of
undergraduates
were
of
pewter
till
a
certain
day
when
they
were
changed
for
porcelain
i
can
not
remember
whether
this
was
at
the
time
when
they
became
questionists
in
the
october
term
or
at
the
time
when
they
were
declared
actualiter
esse
in
artibus
baccalaureos
in
the
lent
term
up
to
the
questionist
time
the
undergraduate
scholars
had
no
mixture
whatever
they
were
the
only
pure
table
in
the
hall
and
i
looked
on
this
as
a
matter
very
valuable
for
the
ultimate
state
of
the
college
society
but
in
the
october
term
those
who
were
to
proceed
to
were
drafted
into
the
mixed
body
of
questionists
and
they
greatly
disliked
the
change
they
continued
so
till
the
lent
term
when
they
were
formally
invited
by
the
bachelor
scholars
to
join
the
upper
table
mathematical
subjects
of
study
and
examination
in
the
october
term
the
only
books
on
pure
mathematics
were
euclid
generally
algebra
by
dr
wood
formerly
tutor
but
in
master
of
st
john
college
vince
fluxions
and
fluxions
woodhouse
and
other
trigonometries
not
a
whisper
passed
through
the
university
generally
on
the
subject
of
differential
calculus
although
some
papers
subsequently
much
valued
on
that
subject
had
been
written
by
mr
woodhouse
fellow
of
caius
college
but
their
style
was
repulsive
and
they
never
took
hold
of
the
university
whewell
mechanics
contains
a
few
and
easy
applications
of
the
differential
calculus
the
books
on
applied
mathematics
were
wood
mechanics
whewell
mechanics
wood
optics
vince
hydrostatics
vince
astronomy
woodhouse
plane
astronomy
perhaps
rather
later
the
first
book
of
newton
principia
i
do
not
remember
any
others
these
works
were
undoubtedly
able
and
for
the
great
proportion
of
university
students
going
into
active
life
i
do
not
conceal
my
opinion
that
books
constructed
on
the
principles
of
those
which
i
have
cited
were
more
useful
than
those
exclusively
founded
on
the
more
modern
system
for
those
students
who
aimed
at
the
mastery
of
results
more
difficult
and
in
the
intellectual
sense
more
important
the
older
books
were
quite
insufficient
more
aspiring
students
read
and
generally
with
much
care
several
parts
of
principia
book
and
also
book
iii
perhaps
the
noblest
example
of
geometrical
form
of
cosmical
theory
that
the
world
has
seen
i
remember
some
questions
from
book
iii
proposed
in
the
examination
in
the
october
term
i
went
up
to
the
university
the
works
of
wood
and
vince
which
i
have
mentioned
still
occupied
the
but
a
great
change
was
in
preparation
for
the
university
course
of
mathematics
during
the
great
continental
war
the
intercourse
between
men
of
science
in
england
and
in
france
had
been
most
insignificant
but
in
the
autumn
of
three
members
of
the
senate
john
herschel
george
peacock
and
charles
babbage
had
entered
into
the
mathematical
society
of
paris
and
brought
away
some
of
the
works
on
pure
mathematics
especially
those
of
lacroix
and
on
mechanics
principally
poisson
in
they
made
a
translation
of
lacroix
differential
calculus
and
they
prepared
a
volume
of
examples
of
the
differential
and
integral
calculus
these
were
extensively
studied
but
the
form
of
the
college
examinations
or
the
university
examinations
was
not
i
think
influenced
by
them
in
the
winter
or
the
two
following
terms
but
in
the
winter
peacock
was
one
of
the
moderators
and
in
the
examination
january
he
boldly
proposed
a
paper
of
important
questions
entirely
in
the
differential
calculus
this
was
considered
as
establishing
the
new
system
in
the
university
in
january
i
think
the
two
systems
were
mingled
though
i
was
myself
subject
to
that
examination
i
grieve
to
say
that
i
have
forgotten
much
of
the
details
except
that
i
well
remember
that
some
of
the
questions
referred
to
newton
book
iii
on
the
lunar
theory
to
these
i
have
already
alluded
no
other
work
occurs
to
me
as
worthy
of
mention
except
lunar
theory
entirely
founded
on
the
differential
calculus
the
style
of
this
book
was
not
attractive
and
it
was
very
little
read
chapter
iii
at
trinity
college
cambridge
from
his
taking
his
degree
to
his
taking
charge
of
the
cambridge
observatory
as
plumian
professor
from
january
to
march
on
i
returned
to
cambridge
i
had
already
heard
that
i
had
gained
the
smith
prize
and
one
of
the
first
notifications
to
me
on
my
return
was
that
the
walker
prize
of
was
awarded
to
me
i
remember
that
my
return
was
not
very
pleasant
for
our
table
in
hall
was
half
occupied
by
a
set
of
irregular
men
who
had
lost
terms
and
were
obliged
to
reside
somewhat
longer
in
order
to
receive
the
degree
but
at
the
time
of
my
completing
the
degree
which
is
not
till
some
weeks
after
the
examination
and
admission
i
with
the
other
complete
bachelors
was
duly
invited
to
the
table
of
the
scholars
and
that
annoyance
ended
the
liberation
from
undergraduate
study
left
me
at
liberty
generally
to
pursue
my
own
course
except
so
far
as
it
was
influenced
by
the
preparation
for
fellowship
examination
and
also
left
me
at
liberty
to
earn
more
money
in
the
way
usual
with
the
graduates
by
taking
undergraduate
pupils
mr
peacock
recommended
me
to
take
only
four
which
occupied
me
four
hours
every
day
and
for
each
of
them
i
received
guineas
each
term
my
first
pupils
for
the
lent
and
easter
terms
were
williamson
afterwards
head
master
of
westminster
school
james
parker
afterwards
and
bissett
and
clinton
of
caius
to
all
these
i
had
been
engaged
before
taking
my
degree
i
kept
up
classical
subjects
i
have
a
set
of
notes
on
the
greek
ploutos
and
greek
nephelai
of
aristophanes
finished
on
mar
and
i
began
my
daily
writing
of
latin
as
usual
on
in
mathematics
i
worked
very
hard
at
lunar
and
planetary
theories
i
have
two
books
of
lunar
theory
to
the
order
of
small
quantities
which
however
answered
no
purpose
except
that
of
making
me
perfectly
familiar
with
that
subject
i
worked
well
upon
my
quires
the
figure
of
saturn
supposed
homogeneous
as
affected
by
the
attraction
of
his
ring
and
the
figure
of
the
earth
as
heterogeneous
and
the
calculus
of
variations
i
think
it
was
now
that
i
wrote
a
on
constrained
motion
on
mar
i
was
elected
fellow
of
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
on
may
a
cast
of
my
head
was
taken
for
dr
elliotson
an
active
phrenologist
by
deville
a
tradesman
in
the
strand
i
had
long
thought
that
i
should
like
to
visit
scotland
and
on
my
once
saying
so
to
my
mother
she
who
had
a
most
kindly
recollection
of
alnwick
said
in
a
few
words
that
she
thought
i
could
not
do
better
i
had
therefore
for
some
time
past
fully
determined
that
as
soon
as
i
had
sufficient
spare
time
and
money
enough
i
would
go
to
scotland
the
interval
between
the
end
of
easter
term
and
the
usual
beginning
with
pupils
in
the
long
vacation
offered
sufficient
time
and
i
had
now
earned
a
little
money
and
i
therefore
determined
to
go
and
invited
my
sister
to
accompany
me
i
had
no
private
introductions
except
one
from
james
parker
to
mr
reach
a
writer
of
inverness
some
which
drinkwater
sent
being
too
late
on
may
we
went
by
coach
to
stamford
thence
by
pontefract
and
oulton
to
york
where
i
saw
the
cathedral
which
disappointed
me
but
i
suppose
that
we
were
tired
with
the
night
journey
then
by
newcastle
to
alnwick
where
we
stopped
for
the
day
to
see
my
birthplace
on
may
to
edinburgh
on
this
journey
i
remember
well
the
stone
walls
between
the
fields
the
place
in
yorkshire
where
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
rock
the
hambleton
kyloe
cheviot
and
pentland
hills
arthur
seat
but
still
more
strikingly
the
revolving
inch
keith
light
at
edinburgh
i
hired
a
horse
and
gig
for
our
journey
in
scotland
and
we
drove
by
queensferry
to
kinross
where
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
clouds
on
the
hills
viz
on
the
lomond
hills
and
so
to
perth
thence
by
dunkeld
and
killicrankie
to
blair
athol
the
dreariness
of
the
drumochter
pass
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
and
by
aviemore
where
i
saw
snow
on
the
mountains
to
inverness
here
we
received
much
kindness
and
attention
from
mr
reach
and
after
visiting
the
falls
of
foyers
and
other
sights
we
went
to
fort
augustus
and
fort
william
we
ascended
ben
nevis
on
which
there
was
a
great
deal
of
snow
and
visited
the
vitrified
fort
in
glen
nevis
then
by
inverary
to
tarbet
and
ascended
ben
lomond
from
whence
we
had
a
magnificent
view
we
then
passed
by
loch
achray
to
glasgow
where
we
found
james
parker
brother
his
father
of
the
house
of
macinroy
and
parker
being
a
wealthy
merchant
of
glasgow
on
june
to
mr
parker
house
at
blochairn
near
glasgow
on
this
day
i
heard
dr
chalmers
preach
and
on
the
went
with
the
family
by
steamer
the
first
that
i
had
seen
to
fairly
near
largs
i
returned
the
gig
to
edinburgh
visited
arran
and
bute
and
we
then
went
by
coach
to
carlisle
and
by
penrith
to
keswick
by
the
old
road
never
shall
i
forget
the
beauty
of
the
approach
to
keswick
after
visiting
ambleside
and
kendal
we
returned
to
cambridge
by
way
of
leeds
and
posted
to
bury
on
the
june
the
expense
of
this
expedition
was
about
it
opened
a
completely
new
world
to
me
i
had
little
time
to
rest
at
bury
in
the
preceding
term
drinkwater
buckle
and
myself
had
engaged
to
go
somewhere
into
the
country
with
pupils
during
the
long
vacation
as
was
customary
with
cambridge
men
buckle
however
changed
his
mind
drinkwater
went
to
look
for
a
place
fixed
on
swansea
and
engaged
a
house
called
the
cambrian
hotel
kept
by
a
captain
jenkins
on
the
morning
of
july
i
left
bury
for
london
and
by
mail
coach
to
bristol
on
the
morning
of
july
by
steamer
to
swansea
and
arrived
late
at
night
i
had
then
five
pupils
parker
harman
lewis
afterwards
professor
in
king
college
london
pierce
morton
gibson
and
guest
of
caius
afterwards
master
of
the
college
drinkwater
had
four
viz
two
malkins
from
bury
elphinstone
afterwards
and
farish
son
of
professor
farish
we
lived
a
strange
life
my
pupils
began
with
me
at
six
in
the
morning
i
was
myself
reading
busily
we
lived
completely
with
two
besides
the
house
establishment
one
of
our
first
acts
was
to
order
a
boat
to
be
built
fitted
with
a
she
was
called
the
granta
of
swansea
in
the
meantime
we
made
sea
excursions
with
boats
borrowed
from
ships
in
the
port
on
july
with
a
borrowed
boat
we
went
out
when
the
sea
was
high
but
soon
found
our
boat
unmanageable
and
at
last
got
into
a
place
where
the
sea
was
breaking
heavily
over
a
shoal
and
the
two
of
the
crew
who
were
nearest
to
me
malkin
and
lewis
one
on
each
side
were
carried
out
they
were
good
swimmers
and
we
recovered
them
though
with
some
trouble
the
breaker
had
passed
quite
over
my
head
we
gained
the
shore
and
the
boat
was
taken
home
by
land
when
our
own
boat
was
finished
we
had
some
most
picturesque
adventures
at
the
mumbles
aberavon
caswell
bay
ilfracombe
and
tenby
from
all
this
i
learnt
navigation
pretty
well
the
mixture
of
hard
study
and
exertion
seemed
to
affect
the
health
of
several
of
us
i
was
one
we
were
covered
with
painful
boils
my
began
again
on
july
i
have
notes
on
demosthenes
lucretius
and
greek
history
in
mathematics
i

in
august
there
occurred
an
absurd
quarrel
between
the
fellows
of
trinity
and
the
undergraduates
on
the
occasion
of
commencing
the
building
of
king
court
when
the
undergraduates
were
not
invited
to
wine
and
absented
themselves
from
the
hall
there
were
vacant
this
year
five
fellowships
in
trinity
college
in
general
the
of
the
first
year
are
not
allowed
to
sit
for
fellowships
but
this
year
it
was
thought
so
probable
that
permission
would
be
given
that
on
mr
higman
then
appointed
as
tutor
to
a
third
of
the
college
wrote
to
me
to
engage
me
as
assistant
mathematical
tutor
in
the
event
of
my
being
elected
a
fellow
on
and
i
provisionally
engaged
myself
about
the
same
time
i
had
written
to
mr
peacock
who
recommended
me
to
sit
and
to
mr
whewell
who
after
consultation
with
the
master
dr
wordsworth
discouraged
it
as
there
was
no
absolute
prohibition
i
left
swansea
on
before
my
engagement
to
my
pupils
was
quite
finished
and
returned
to
cambridge
by
gloucester
oxford
and
london
i
gave
in
my
name
at
the
butteries
as
candidate
for
fellowship
but
was
informed
in
a
day
or
two
that
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
sit
on
i
walked
to
bury
i
walked
back
to
cambridge
on
during
this
october
term
i
had
four
pupils
neate
cankrein
turner
afterwards
wrangler
and
treasurer
of
guy
hospital
and
william
hervey
son
of
the

my
daily
writing
of
latin
commenced
on
in
november
i
began

peacock
on

solid
geometry
figure

and
much
about

i
also
in
this
term
wrote
a
on
the
calculus
of
variations
and
one
on
wood
algebra
and
parts
i
have
also
notes
of
the
temperature
of

in
cornwall
something
on
the
light
of
and
reminiscences
of
swansea
in
a
view
of
oswick
bay
in
november
i
attended
professor
sedgwick
geological
lectures
at
some
time
in
this
term
i
had
a
letter
from
mr
south
to
whom
i
suppose
i
had
written
regarding
the
difficulty
of
my
telescope
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
tulley
and
i
suppose
that
thus
the
matter
had
become
more
fully
known
to
him
he
then
enquired
if
i
could
visit
him
in
the
winter
vacation
i
accordingly
went
from
bury
and
was
received
by
him
at
his
house
in
blackman
street
for
a
week
or
more
with
great
kindness
he
introduced
me
to
sir
humphrey
davy
and
many
other
london
savans
and
shewed
me
many
london
sights
and
the
greenwich
observatory
i
also
had
a
little
practice
with
his
own
instruments
he
was
then
on
intimate
terms
with
mr
herschel
afterwards
sir
john
herschel
then
living
in
london
who
came
occasionally
to
observe
double
stars
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
saw
practical
astronomy
it
seems
that
i
borrowed
his
mountain
barometer
in
the
lent
term
i
wrote
to
him
regarding
the
deduction
of
the
parallax
of
mars
from
a
comparison
of
the
relative
positions
of
mars
and
leonis
as
observed
by
him
and
by
rumker
at
paramatta
my
working
is
on
loose
papers
i
see
that
i
have
worked
out
perfectly
the
interpolations
the
effects
of
uncertainty
of
longitude
but
i
do
not
see
whether
i
have
a
final
result
in
at
playford
i
was
working
on
the
effects
of
separating
the
two
lenses
of
an
and
on
the
kind
of
which
would
be
necessary
also
on
spherical
aberrations
and
figure
on
my
quires
at
cambridge
i
was
working
on
the
effects
of
separating
the
lenses
with
the
view
of
correcting
the
secondary
spectrum
and
on
i
received
some
numbers
indices
of
refraction
from
mr
herschel
and
reference
to
numbers
about
this
time
it
was
contemplated
to
add
to
the
royal
observatory
of
greenwich
two
assistants
of
superior
education
whether
this
scheme
was
entertained
by
the
admiralty
the
board
of
longitude
or
the
royal
society
i
do
not
know
somehow
i
think
through
mr
peacock
a
message
from
mr
herschel
was
conveyed
to
me
acquainting
me
of
this
and
suggesting
that
i
should
be
an
excellent
person
for
the
principal
place
to
procure
information
i
went
to
london
on
saturday
sleeping
at
mr
south
to
be
present
at
one
of
sir
humphrey
davy
saturday
evening
soirées
they
were
then
held
every
saturday
and
to
enquire
of
sir
davy
and
dr
young
when
i
found
that
succession
to
the
post
of
astronomer
royal
was
not
considered
as
distinctly
a
consequence
of
it
i
took
it
coolly
and
returned
the
next
night
the
whole
proposal
came
to
nothing
at
this
time
i
was
engaged
upon
differential
equations
mountain
barometer
problem
and
determination
of
the
height
of
the
gogmagogs
and
several
other
points
investigations
connected
with
calculus
spherical
aberration
in
different
planes
geology
especially
regarding
derbyshire
which
i
proposed
to
visit
and
much
of
optics
i
wrote
a
draft
of
my
paper
on
the
figure
of
saturn
and
on
mar
it
was
read
at
the
philosophical
society
under
the
title
of
the
figure
assumed
by
a
fluid
homogeneous
mass
whose
particles
are
acted
on
by
their
mutual
attraction
and
by
small
extraneous
forces
and
is
printed
in
their
memoirs
i
also
wrote
a
draft
of
my
paper
on
achromatic
and
on
may
it
was
read
at
the
philosophical
society
under
the
title
of
the
principles
and
construction
of
the
achromatic
of
telescopes
and
on
the
achromatism
of
microscopes
including
also
the
effects
of
separating
the
lenses
of
the
it
is
printed
in
their
memoirs
amongst
miscellaneous
matters
i
find
that
on
mar
of
this
year
i
began
regularly
making
extracts
from
the
books
of
the
book
society
a
practice
which
i
continued
to
march
on
mar
a
very
rainy
day
i
walked
to
bury
to
attend
the
funeral
of
my
uncle
william
biddell
near
diss
and
on
mar
i
walked
back
in
rain
and
snow
on
i
dined
with
cubitt
in
cambridge
on
may
i
gave
a
certificate
to
rogers
the
assistant
in
crosse
school
and
my
instructor
in
mathematics
which
my
mother
amplified
much
and
which
i
believe
procured
his
election
as
master
of
walsall
school
on
june
i
went
to
bury
the
speeches
at
bury
school
which
i
wished
to
attend
took
place
next
day
at
this
point
of
his
autobiography
the
writer
continues
now
came
one
of
the
most
important
occurrences
in
my
life
the
important
event
in
question
was
his
acquaintance
with
richarda
smith
the
lady
who
afterwards
became
his
wife
the
courtship
was
a
long
one
and
in
the
autobiography
there
are
various
passages
relating
to
it
all
written
in
the
most
natural
and
unaffected
manner
but
of
somewhat
too
private
a
nature
for
publication
it
will
therefore
be
convenient
to
digress
from
the
straight
path
of
the
narrative
in
order
to
insert
a
short
memoir
of
the
lady
who
was
destined
to
influence
his
life
and
happiness
in
a
most
important
degree
richarda
smith
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
rev
richard
smith
who
had
been
a
fellow
of
trinity
college
cambridge
but
was
at
this
time
private
chaplain
to
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
held
the
small
living
of
edensor
near
chatsworth
in
derbyshire
he
had
a
family
of
two
sons
and
seven
daughters
whom
he
had
brought
up
and
educated
very
carefully
several
of
his
daughters
were
remarkable
both
for
their
beauty
and
accomplishments
richarda
smith
was
now
in
her
year
and
the
writer
of
the
autobiography
records
that
at
matlock
we
received
great
attention
from
mr
chenery
in
speaking
of
mr
smith
i
remember
his
saying
that
mr
smith
had
a
daughter
whom
the
duke
of
devonshire
declared
to
be
the
most
beautiful
girl
he
ever
saw
this
was
before
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
airy
was
at
this
time
on
a
walking
tour
in
derbyshire
with
his
brother
william
and
they
were
received
at
edensor
by
mr
smith
to
whom
he
had
letters
of
introduction
he
seems
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
miss
smith
at
first
sight
and
within
two
days
of
first
seeing
her
he
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
neither
his
means
nor
his
prospects
at
that
time
permitted
the
least
idea
of
an
immediate
marriage
and
mr
smith
would
not
hear
of
any
engagement
but
he
never
had
the
least
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
choice
that
he
had
made
he
worked
steadily
on
winning
fame
and
position
and
recommending
his
suit
from
time
to
time
to
miss
smith
as
opportunity
offered
and
finally
married
her
nearly
six
years
after
his
first
proposal
his
constancy
had
its
reward
for
he
gained
a
most
charming
and
affectionate
wife
as
he
records
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
my
wife
was
aged
between
and
but
she
scarcely
appeared
more
than
or
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
her
skill
and
fidelity
in
sketching
and
above
all
her
exquisite
singing
of
ballads
made
a
great
sensation
in
cambridge
their
married
life
lasted
years
but
the
last
six
years
were
saddened
by
the
partial
paralysis
and
serious
illness
of
lady
airy
the
entire
correspondence
between
them
was
most
carefully
preserved
and
is
a
record
of
a
most
happy
union
the
letters
were
written
during
his
numerous
journeys
and
excursions
on
business
or
pleasure
and
it
is
evident
that
his
thoughts
were
with
her
from
the
moment
of
their
parting
every
opportunity
of
writing
was
seized
with
an
energy
and
avidity
that
shewed
how
much
his
heart
was
in
the
correspondence
nothing
was
too
trivial
or
too
important
to
communicate
to
his
wife
whether
relating
to
family
or
business
matters
the
letters
on
both
sides
are
always
full
of
affection
and
sympathy
and
are
written
in
that
spirit
of
confidence
which
arises
from
a
deep
sense
of
the
value
and
necessity
of
mutual
support
in
the
troubles
of
life
and
with
his
active
and
varied
employments
and
his
numerous
family
there
was
no
lack
of
troubles
they
were
both
of
them
sensible
and
practical
people
and
were
very
grateful
for
such
comforts
and
advantages
as
they
were
able
to
command
but
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
their
deep
respect
and
affection
for
one
another
both
by
natural
ability
and
education
she
was
well
qualified
to
enter
into
the
pursuits
of
her
husband
and
in
many
cases
to
assist
him
she
always
welcomed
her
husband
friends
and
by
her
skill
and
attractive
courtesy
kept
them
well
together
she
was
an
admirable
and
in
the
midst
of
her
numerous
domestic
distractions
always
found
time
for
the
duties
of
correspondence
in
conversation
she
was
very
attractive
not
so
much
from
the
wit
or
brilliancy
of
her
remarks
as
from
the
brightness
and
interest
with
which
she
entered
into
the
topics
under
discussion
and
from
the
unfailing
grace
and
courtesy
with
which
she
attended
to
the
views
of
others
this
was
especially
recognized
by
the
foreign
astronomers
and
men
of
science
who
from
time
to
time
stayed
as
guests
at
the
observatory
and
to
whom
she
acted
as
hostess
although
she
was
not
an
accomplished
linguist
yet
she
was
well
able
to
express
herself
in
french
and
german
and
her
natural
good
sense
and
kindliness
placed
her
guests
at
their
ease
and
made
them
feel
themselves
as
indeed
they
were
welcomed
and
at
home
her
father
the
rev
richard
smith
was
a
man
of
most
cultivated
mind
and
of
the
highest
principles
with
a
keen
enjoyment
of
good
society
which
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
his
patron
the
duke
of
devonshire
amply
secured
to
him
both
at
chatsworth
and
in
london
he
had
a
deep
attachment
to
his
alma
mater
of
cambridge
and
though
not
himself
a
mathematician
he
had
a
great
respect
for
the
science
of
mathematics
and
for
eminent
mathematicians
during
the
long
courtship
already
related
mr
smith
conceived
the
highest
respect
for
character
as
well
as
for
his
great
repute
and
attainments
and
expressed
his
lively
satisfaction
at
his
daughter
marriage
thus
on
january
he
wrote
to
his
intended
as
follows
i
have
little
else
to
say
to
you
than
that
i
continue
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
to
reflect
on
the
important
change
about
to
take
place
in
my
dear
daughter
situation
a
father
must
not
allow
himself
to
dilate
on
such
a
subject
of
course
i
feel
confident
that
you
will
have
no
reason
to
repent
the
irrevocable
step
you
have
taken
but
from
the
manner
in
which
richarda
has
been
brought
up
you
will
find
such
a
helpmate
in
her
as
a
man
of
sense
and
affection
would
wish
to
have
and
that
she
is
well
prepared
to
meet
the
duties
and
trials
for
such
must
be
met
with
of
domestic
life
with
a
firm
and
cultivated
mind
and
the
warm
feelings
of
a
kind
heart
her
habits
are
such
as
by
no
means
to
lead
her
to
expensive
wishes
nor
will
you
i
trust
ever
find
it
necessary
to
neglect
those
studies
and
pursuits
upon
which
your
reputation
and
subsistence
are
chiefly
founded
to
seek
for
idle
amusements
for
your
companion
i
must
indulge
no
further
in
speaking
of
her
and
have
only
at
present
to
add
that
i
commit
in
full
confidence
into
your
hands
the
guardianship
of
my
happiness
and
on
april
shortly
after
their
marriage
he
wrote
to
his
daughter
thus
if
thinking
of
you
could
supply
your
place
amongst
us
you
would
have
been
with
us
unceasingly
for
we
have
all
of
us
made
you
the
principal
object
of
our
thoughts
and
our
talk
since
you
left
us
and
i
travelled
with
you
all
your
journey
to
your
present
delightful
home
we
had
all
but
one
feeling
of
the
purest
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
the
true
domestic
comfort
to
which
we
fully
believe
you
to
be
now
gone
and
we
rejoice
that
all
your
endearing
qualities
will
now
be
employed
to
promote
the
happiness
of
one
whom
we
think
so
worthy
of
them
as
your
dear
husband
who
has
left
us
in
the
best
opinion
of
his
good
heart
as
well
as
his
enlightened
and
sound
understanding
his
late
stay
with
us
has
endeared
him
to
us
all
never
did
man
enter
into
the
married
state
from
more
honourable
motives
or
from
a
heart
more
truly
seeking
the
genuine
happiness
of
that
state
than
mr
airy
and
he
will
i
trust
find
his
reward
in
you
from
all
that
a
good
wife
can
render
to
the
best
of
husbands
and
his
happiness
be
reflected
on
yourself
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
letters
of
more
genuine
feeling
and
satisfaction
or
more
eloquently
expressed
than
these
the
narrative
of
the
autobiography
will
now
be
resumed
i
had
been
disappointed
two
years
before
of
an
expedition

he
invited
us

employed
himself
in

been
denied

whom
i
studied
french
with
reasonable
assiduity
for
the
three
terms
to
june
among
mathematical
investigations
i
find
theory
of
the
brightness
motion
of
a
body
in
an
ellipse
round
two
centres
of
force
various
differential
equations
numerical
computation
of
sin
pi
from

numerical
computation
of
sines
of
various
arcs
to
decimals
curvature
of
surfaces
in
various

of
sound
i
began
in
the
winter
a
latin
essay
as
competing
for
the
middle
bachelors
prize
but
did
not
proceed
with
it
i
afterwards
wished
that
i
had
followed
it
up
but
my
time
was
fully
occupied
on
i
started
for
edensor
where
i
paid
a
visit
and
returned
on
on
i
wrote
to
mr
clarkson
asking
his
advice
about
a
profession
or
mode
of
life
the
cares
of
life
were
now
beginning
to
press
me
heavily
and
continued
to
do
so
for
several
years
he
replied
very
kindly
but
his
answer
amounted
to
nothing
about
the
same
time
i
had
some
conversation
of
the
same
kind
with
mr
peacock
which
was
equally
fruitless
on
i
have
investigations
of
the
density
of
light
near
a
caustic
on
the
theory
of
emissions
on
i
finished
a
paper
about
the
defect
in
my
eye
which
was
communicated
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
on
mr
peacock
or
mr
whewell
had
some
time
previously
applied
to
me
to
write
a
paper
on
trigonometry
for
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
and
i
had
been
collecting
some
materials
especially
in
regard
to
its
history
at
every
visit
to
london
where
i
read
sometimes
at
the
british
museum
also
in
the
cambridge
libraries
i
began
this
paper
roughly
on
and
finished
it
on
mar
the
history
of
which
i
speak
by
some
odd
management
of
the
editors
of
the
encyclopaedia
was
never
published
the
is
now
amongst
the
mss
of
the
royal
observatory
greenwich
other
subjects
on
my
quires
are
theory
of
musical
concords
many
things
relating
to
trigonometry
and
trigonometrical
tables
achromatic
equation
to
the
surface
bounding
the
rays
that
enter
my
left
eye
experiments
on
percussion
also
notes
on
cumberland
and
wales
i
had
already
proposed
to
myself
to
take
a
party
of
pupils
in
the
long
vacation
to
keswick
and
notes
on
history
and
geology
i
had
been
in
correspondence
with
dr
malkin
master
of
bury
school
who
on
sent
a
certificate
for
my
brother
william
whom
i
entered
at
trinity
on
peacock
side
on
mar
i
changed
my
rooms
quitting
those
on
the
east
side
of
queen
mary
gate
for
rooms
in
neville
court
south
side
the
easternmost
rooms
in
this
term
my
lectures
lasted
from
apr
to
may
apparently
i
had
only
the
senior
sophs
in
number
and
the
same
four
pupils
turner
dobbs
cooper
hovenden
as
in
the
preceding
term
the
only
scientific
subjects
on
which
i
find
notes
are
a
paper
on
the
forms
of
the
teeth
of
wheels
communicated
to
the
philosophical
society
on
may
some
notes
about
musical
concords
and
some
examination
of
a
strange
piece
of
iceland
spar
on
apr
i
was
elected
to
the
northern
institution
of
inverness
the
first
compliment
that
i
received
from
an
extraneous
body
on
may
i
have
a
most
careful
examination
of
my
money
accounts
to
see
whether
i
can
make
an
expedition
with
my
sister
into
wales
my
sister
came
to
cambridge
and
on
monday
may
we
started
for
wales
equipped
in
the
lightest
way
for
a
walking
expedition
we
went
by
birmingham
to
shrewsbury
then
to
the
pontycyssylte
aqueduct
and
by
various
places
to
bala
and
thence
by
llanrwst
to
conway
here
the
suspension
bridge
was
under
construction
the
mole
was
made
and
the
piers
but
nothing
else
then
on
to
bangor
where
nine
chains
of
the
suspension
bridge
were
in
place
and
so
to
holyhead
then
by
carnarvon
to
bethgelert
ascending
snowdon
by
the
way
and
in
succession
by
festiniog
dolgelly
and
aberystwyth
to
hereford
the
first
time
that
i
had
visited
it
since
my
father
left
it
from
thence
we
went
by
coach
to
london
and
i
went
on
to
cambridge
on
the
of
june
i
had
arranged
to
take
a
party
of
pupils
to
keswick
and
to
take
my
brother
there
mr
clarkson
had
provided
me
with
introductions
to
mr
southey
and
mr
wordsworth
on
wednesday
june
we
started
and
went
by
leicester
sheffield
leeds
and
kendal
to
keswick
calling
at
edensor
on
the
way
my
pupils
were
cleasby
marshman
clinton
wigram
tottenham
and
smith
at
keswick
i
passed
three
months
very
happily
i
saw
mr
southey
family
frequently
and
mr
wordsworth
occasionally
by
continual
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
and
by
a
few
excursions
to
places
as
distant
as
bowness
calder
bridge
always
climbing
the
intermediate
mountains
i
became
well
acquainted
with
almost
the
whole
of
that
beautiful
country
excepting
some
of
the
dales
a
geological
hammer
and
a
mountain
barometer
were
very
interesting
companions
i
had
plenty
of
work
with
my
pupils
i
worked
a
little
lunar
theory
a
little
of
laplace
equations
something
of
the
figure
of
the
earth
and
i
wrote
out
very
carefully
my
trigonometry
for
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
i
read
a
little
of
machiavelli
and
various
books
which
i
borrowed
of
mr
southey
on
friday
my
brother
and
i
left
for
kendal
and
after
a
stay
of
a
few
days
at
edensor
arrived
at
cambridge
on
on
my
lectures
to
the
junior
sophs
began
names
lasting
to
those
to
the
senior
sophs
names
oct
to
i
also
examined
questionists
as
last
year
i
have
notes
about
a
paper
on
the
connection
of
impact
and
pressure
read
at
the
philosophical
society
on
but
not
printed

seen
in
my

density
of

near
a
caustic
in
this
term
i
accomplished
the
preparation
of
a
volume
of
mathematical
tracts
on
subjects
which
either
from
their
absolute
deficiency
in
the
university
or
from
the
unreadable
form
in
which
they
had
been
presented
appeared
to
be
wanted
the
subjects
of
my
tracts
were
lunar
theory
begun
finished
figure
of
the
earth
part
finished
precession
and
nutation
my
old
put
in
order
and
the
calculus
of
variations
i
applied
as
is
frequently
done
to
the
syndicate
of
the
university
press
for
assistance
in
publishing
the
work
and
they
agreed
to
give
me
paper
and
printing
for
copies
this
notice
was
received
from
professor
turton
on
it
was
probably
also
in
this
year
that
i
drew
up
an
imperfect
of
coddington
optics
a
work
which
deserved
severe
censure
my
review
was
never
finished
in
the
long
vacation
at
keswick
i
had
six
pupils
at
each
in
the
october
term
i
had
marshman
and
ogilby
at
for
three
terms
and
dobbs
at
for
three
terms
i
had
at
mr
peacock
suggestion
raised
my
rate
from
to
guineas
for
three
terms
this
prevented
some
from
applying
to
me
and
induced
some
to
withdraw
who
had
been
connected
with
me
but
it
did
me
no
real
hurt
for
engrossment
by
pupils
is
the
worst
of
all
things
that
can
happen
to
a
man
who
hopes
to
distinguish
himself
on
i
went
to
bury
and
returned
to
cambridge
on
i
have
the
of
my
lectures
to
senior
sophs
from
to
and
to
freshmen
from
to

it
would
appear
that
i
gave
but
one

my
belief
was
that
i
always
had
two
the

for

some
time
in
this
term
i
began
to
think
of
the
possibility
of
observing
the
diminution
of
gravity
in
a
deep
mine
and
communicated
with
whewell
who
was
disposed
to
join
in
experiments
my
first
notion
was
simply
to
try
the
rate
of
a
clock
and
the
ecton
mine
was
first
thought
of
i
made
enquiries
about
the
ecton
mine
through
mr
smith
of
edensor
and
visited
the
mine
but
in
the
meantime
whewell
had
made
enquiries
in
london
and
found
principally
from
dr
paris
that
the
mine
of
dolcoath
near
camborne
in
cornwall
would
be
a
better
place
for
the
experiment
dr
paris
wrote
to
me
repeatedly
and
ultimately
we
resolved
on
trying
it
there
in
my
papers
on
mar
are
various
investigations
about
attractions
in
both
mines
on
apr
i
went
to
london
principally
to
arrange
about
dolcoath
and
during
april
and
may
i
was
engaged
in
correspondence
with
sir
davy
president
of
the
royal
society
mr
herschel
and
dr
young
secretary
of
the
board
of
longitude
about
the
loan
of
instruments
and
pendulums
on
apr
i
was
practising
by
coincidence
and
about
this
time
repeatedly
practised
transits
with
a
small
instrument
lent
by
mr
sheepshanks
with
whom
my
acquaintance
must
have
begun
no
long
time
before
which
was
erected
under
a
tent
in
the
walks
on
my
quires
i
find
various
schemes
for
graduating
thermometers
for
pendulum
experiments
i
find
also
notes
of
examination
of
my
brother
william
who
had
come
to
college
last
october
and
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
with
my
mother
and
sister
and
mr
case
a
lawyer
about
a
troublesome
business
with
mr
cropley
an
old
friend
of
biddell
to
whom
my
father
had
lent
and
whose
affairs
were
in
chancery
my
lectures
in
this
term
were
to
the
junior
sophs
from
apr
to
may
they
were
six
in
number
and
not
very
regular
on
apr
i
sent
to
mawman
the
copy
of
my
trigonometry
for
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
for
which
i
received
i
received
notice
from
the
press
syndicate
that
the
price
of
my
mathematical
tracts
was
fixed
at
i
sold
the
edition
to
deighton
for
and
it
was
immediately
published
about
this
time
i
have
letters
from
mr
herschel
and
sir
davy
about
a
paper
to
be
presented
to
the
royal
society
i
suppose
about
the
figure
of
the
earth
to
the
order
of
ellipticity
which
was
read
to
the
royal
society
on
june
on
saturday
may
i
went
to
london
on
the
way
to
dolcoath
and
received
four
chronometers
from
the
royal
observatory
greenwich
i
travelled
by
devonport
and
falmouth
to
camborne
where
i
arrived
on
may
and
dined
at
the
dinner
at
the
mine
i
was
accompanied
by
ibbotson
who
was
engaged
as
a
pupil
and
intended
for
an
engineer
on
may
whewell
arrived
and
we
took
a
pendulum
and
clock
down
and
on
the
commenced
the
observation
of
coincidences
in
earnest
this
work
with
the
changing
of
the
pendulums
and
sundry
short
expeditions
occupied
nearly
three
weeks
we
had
continued
the
computation
of
our
observations
at
every
possible
interval
it
is
to
be
understood
that
we
had
one
detached
pendulum
swinging
in
front
of
a
clock
pendulum
above
and
another
similarly
mounted
below
and
that
the
clocks
were
compared
by
chronometers
compared
above
carried
down
and
compared
compared
before
leaving
and
brought
up
and
compared
the
upper
and
lower
pendulums
had
been
interchanged
it
was
found
now
that
the
reliance
on
the
steadiness
of
the
chronometers
was
too
great
and
a
new
method
was
devised
in
which
for
each
series
the
chronometers
should
make
four
journeys
and
have
four
comparisons
above
and
two
below
this
arrangement
commenced
on
the
june
and
continued
till
the
on
the
we
packed
the
lower
instruments
intending
to
compare
the
pendulum
directly
with
the
upper
one
and
sent
them
up
the
shaft
when
an
inexplicable
occurrence
stopped
all
proceedings
the
basket
containing
all
the
important
instruments
was
brought
up
to
the
surface
in
my
presence
on
fire
some
of
the
instruments
had
fallen
out
with
their
cases
burning
whether
a
superstitious
miner
had
intentionally
fired
it
or
whether
the
snuff
of
a
candle
had
been
thrown
into
it
is
not
known
our
labour
was
now
rendered
useless
on
the
i
packed
up
what
remained
of
instruments
left
for
truro
and
arrived
at
bury
on
july
during
our
stay
in
cornwall
i
had
attended
a
or
sale
of
ore
at
camborne
and
we
had
made
expeditions
to
the
coast
to
portreath
and
illogan
to
marazion
and
st
mount
and
to
penzance
and
the
land
end
on
july
i
saw
mr
cropley
in
bury
gaol
and
went
to
cambridge
on
the
i
was
admitted
and
on
the
was
admitted
major
fellow
i
had
engaged
with
four
pupils
to
go
to
orléans
in
this
long
vacation
my
brother
william
was
also
to
go
one
of
my
pupils
dobbs
did
not
join
the
other
three
were
tinkler
ogilby
and
ibbotson
we
left
london
on
july
and
travelled
by
brighton
dieppe
rouen
and
paris
to
orléans
at
paris
i
saw
bouvard
pouillet
laplace
and
arago
i
had
introductions
from
mr
peacock
mr
south
mr
herschel
dr
young
and
from
professor
sedgwick
to
an
english
resident
mr
underwood
on
the
i
was
established
in
the
house
of
lagarde
protestant
minister
here
i
received
my
pupils
on
the
i
commenced
italian
with
an
italian
master
perhaps
i
might
have
done
more
prudently
in
adhering
to
french
for
i
made
no
great
progress
on
i
saw
a
murderer
guillotined
in
the
place
martroi
the
principal
investigations
on
my
quires
are
investigations
about
pendulums
calculus
of
variations
notes
for
the
figure
of
the
earth
encyc
metrop
and
commencement
of
the
article
machinery
i
picked
up
various
french
ballads
read
various
books
got
copies
of
the
marseillaise
this
i
was
obliged
to
obtain
rather
secretly
as
the
legitimist
power
under
charles
was
then
at
its
height
and
other
music
and
particulars
of
farm
wages
for
whewell
and
jones
the
summer
was
intensely
hot
and
i
believe
that
the
heat
and
the
work
in
dolcoath
had
weakened
me
a
good
deal
the
family
was
the
old
clergyman
his
wife
his
daughter
and
finally
his
son
we
lived
together
very
amicably
my
brother
lodged
in
a
café
in
the
place
martroi
the
others
in
different
families
i
left
orléans
on
for
paris
here
i
attended
the
institut
and
was
present
at
one
of
ampère
lectures
i
arrived
at
cambridge
on
on
whewell
mentioned
to
me
that
the
lucasian
professorship
would
be
immediately
vacated
by
turton
and
encouraged
me
to
compete
for
it
shortly
afterwards
mr
higman
mentioned
the
professorship
and
joshua
king
of
queens
spoke
on
the
restriction
which
prevented
college
tutors
or
assistant
tutors
from
holding
the
office
about
this
time
mr
peacock
rendered
me
a
very
important
service
as
the
emolument
of
the
lucasian
professorship
was
only
and
that
of
the
assistant
tutorship
i
had
determined
to
withdraw
from
the
candidature
but
mr
peacock
represented
to
me
the
advantage
of
position
which
would
be
gained
by
obtaining
the
professorship
which
i
then
instantly
saw
and
i
continued
to
be
a
candidate
i
wrote
letters
to
the
heads
of
colleges
the
electors
and
canvassed
them
personally
only
dr
davy
the
master
of
caius
college
at
once
promised
me
his
vote
dr
french
master
of
jesus
college
was
a
candidate
and
several
of
the
heads
had
promised
him
their
votes
mr
babbage
the
third
candidate
threatened
legal
proceedings
and
dr
french
withdrew
the
course
was
now
open
for
mr
babbage
and
me
in
the
meetings
of
the
philosophical
society
a
new
mode
of
proceeding
was
introduced
this
term
to
enliven
the
meetings
private
members
were
requested
to
give
oral
lectures
mine
was
the
second
i
think
and
i
took
for
subject
the
machinery
of
the
steam
engines
in
the
cornish
mines
and
especially
of
the
pumping
engines
and
pumps
it
made
an
excellent
lecture
the
subjects
were
at
that
time
undescribed
in
books
and
unknown
to
engineers
in
general
out
of
cornwall
my
college
lectures
seem
to
have
been
to
to
junior
sophs
to
to
senior
sophs
i
assisted
at
the
examinations
of
the
questionists
i
had
no
private
pupils
on
i
communicated
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
a
paper
on
the
theory
of
pendulums
balances
and
escapements
and
i
find
applications
of
babbage
symbolism
to
an
escapement
which
i
proposed
i
have
various
investigations
about
the
earth
supposed
to
project
at
middle
latitudes
above
the
elliptical
form
in
november
an
account
of
the
dolcoath
failure
by
whewell
was
given
to
the
royal
society
at
length
on
the
election
to
the
lucasian
professorship
took
place
i
was
elected
i
think
unanimously
and
admitted
i
believe
that
this
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
university
in
general
my
uncle
arthur
biddell
was
in
cambridge
on
that
evening
and
was
the
first
of
my
friends
who
heard
of
it
on
the
same
page
of
my
quires
on
which
this
is
mentioned
there
is
a
great
list
of
apparatus
to
be
constructed
for
lucasian
lectures
notes
of
experiments
with
atwood
machine
in
december
correspondence
with
dollond
about
prisms
i
immediately
issued
a
printed
notice
that
i
would
give
professorial
lectures
in
the
next
term
on
i
have
a
letter
from
mr
smith
informing
me
of
the
dangerous
illness
fever
which
had
attacked
nearly
every
member
of
his
family
richarda
worst
of
all
on
i
went
to
bury
the
affairs
with
cropley
had
been
settled
by
the
sale
of
his
property
under
execution
and
my
father
did
not
lose
much
of
his
debt
but
he
had
declined
much
in
body
and
mind
and
now
had
strange
hallucinations
the
commencement
of
found
me
in
a
better
position
not
in
money
but
in
prospects
than
i
had
before
stood
in
yet
it
was
far
from
satisfactory
i
had
resigned
my
assistant
tutorship
of
per
annum
together
with
the
prospect
of
succeeding
to
a
tutorship
and
gained
only
the
lucasian
professorship
of
per
annum
i
had
a
great
aversion
to
entering
the
church
and
my
lay
fellowship
would
expire
in
years
my
prospects
in
the
law
or
other
professions
might
have
been
good
if
i
could
have
waited
but
then
i
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
starvation
probably
for
many
years
and
marriage
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
i
much
preferred
a
moderate
income
in
no
long
time
and
i
am
sure
that
in
this
i
judged
rightly
for
my
happiness
i
had
now
in
some
measure
taken
science
as
my
line
though
not
irrevocably
and
i
thought
it
best
to
work
it
well
for
a
time
at
least
and
wait
for
accidents
the
acceptance
of
the
lucasian
professorship
prevented
me
from
being
pressed
by
sedgwick
who
was
proctor
this
year
to
take
the
office
of
moderator
which
was
a
great
relief
to
me
as
lucasian
professor
i
was
ipso
facto
member
of
the
board
of
longitude
a
stipend
of
a
year
was
attached
to
this
on
condition
of
attending
four
meetings
but
i
had
good
reason
from
intimations
by
south
and
other
persons
in
london
for
believing
that
this
would
not
last
long
the
fortnightly
notices
of
the
meetings
of
the
board
were
given
on
mar
may
and
on
i
came
from
london
to
bury
i
found
my
father
in
a
very
declining
state
the
painful
rheumatism
of
some
years
had
changed
to
ulcerations
of
the
legs
and
he
was
otherwise
helpless
and
had
distressing
hallucinations
on
i
walked
to
cambridge
at
both
places
i
was
occupied
in
preparations
for
the
smith
prize
examination
and
for
lectures
for
the
latter
i
obtained
at
bury
gaol
some
numerical
results
about
of
the
smith
prize
i
was
officially
an
examiner
and
i
determined
to
begin
with
had
never
been
done
before
making
the
examination
public
by
printing
the
papers
of
questions
the
prize
is
the
highest
mathematical
honour
in
the
university
the
competitors
are
incepting
bachelors
of
arts
after
the
examination
for
that
degree
my
day
of
examination
apparently
was
the
candidates
were
turner
cankrein
cleasby
and
mr
gordon
the
first
three
had
been
my
private
pupils
mr
gordon
was
a
of
st
peter
college
and
had
just
passed
the
examination
as
senior
wrangler
turner
being
second
my
situation
as
examiner
was
rather
a
delicate
one
and
the
more
so
as
when
i
came
to
examine
the
papers
of
answers
turner
appeared
distinctly
the
first
late
at
night
i
carried
the
papers
to
whewell
rooms
and
he
on
inspection
agreed
with
me
the
other
examiners
professors
lax
and
woodhouse
lowndean
and
plumian
professors
generally
supported
me
and
turner
had
the
honour
of
first
smith
prize
on
my
mother
wrote
asking
if
i
could
see
cropley
in
london
where
he
was
imprisoned
for
contempt
of
chancery
i
attended
the
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
on
and
afterwards
visited
cropley
in
the
fleet
prison
he
died
there
some
time
later
it
was
by
the
sale
of
his
effects
under
execution
that
my
father
debt
was
paid
on
i
communicated
to
the
royal
society
a
paper
on
the
correction
of
the
solar
tables
from
south
observations
i
believe
that
i
had
alluded
to
this
at
the
february
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
and
that
in
consequence
mr
pond
the
astronomer
royal
had
been
requested
to
prepare
the
errors
of
the
sun
place
from
the
greenwich
observations
which
were
supplied
some
months
later
with
the
exception
of
south
solar
errors
and
some
investigations
about
i
do
not
find
anything
going
on
but
matters
connected
with
my
approaching
lectures
there
are
bridges
trusses
and
other
mechanical
matters
theoretical
and
practical
without
end
several
tradesmen
in
cambridge
and
london
were
well
employed
on
i
have
a
letter
from
cubitt
about
groins
i
remember
studying
those
of
the
and
other
places
on
my
syllabus
of
lectures
was
finished
this
in
subsequent
years
was
greatly
improved
i
applied
to
the
royal
society
for
the
loan
of
but
they
declined
to
lend
it
about
this
time
i
find
observations
of
the
spectrum
of
sirius
there
had
been
no
lectures
on
experimental
philosophy
mechanics
hydrostatics
optics
for
many
years
the
university
in
general
i
believe
looked
with
great
satisfaction
to
my
vigorous
beginning
still
there
was
considerable
difficulty
about
it
there
was
no
understood
term
for
the
lectures
no
understood
hour
of
the
day
no
understood
lecture
room
i
began
this
year
in
the
lent
term
but
in
all
subsequent
years
i
took
the
easter
term
mainly
for
the
chance
of
sunlight
for
the
optical
experiments
which
i
soon
made
important
i
could
get
no
room
but
a
private
or
retiring
room
not
a
regular
lecture
room
in
the
buildings
at
the
old
botanic
garden
in
following
years
i
had
the
room
under
the
university
library
the
lectures
commenced
on
some
day
in
february
i
think
that
the
number
who
attended
them
was
about
i
remember
very
well
that
the
matter
which
i
had
prepared
as
an
introductory
lecture
did
not
last
above
half
the
time
that
i
had
expected
but
i
managed
very
well
to
fill
up
the
hour
on
another
occasion
i
was
so
that
i
had
contemplated
giving
notice
that
i
was
unable
to
complete
the
lecture
but
i
saw
in
the
front
row
some
strangers
introduced
by
some
of
my
regular
attendants
very
busy
in
taking
notes
and
as
it
was
evident
that
a
now
would
not
do
i
silently
exerted
myself
to
think
of
something
and
made
a
very
good
lecture
on
mar
as
official
examiner
i
received
notices
from
candidates
for
bell
scholarships
and
prepared
my
paper
of
questions
i
do
not
remember
my
day
of
examination
but
i
had
all
the
answers
to
all
the
examiners
questions
in
my
hands
when
on
mar
i
received
notice
that
my
father
had
died
the
preceding
evening
this
stopped
my
lectures
they
were
concluded
in
the
next
term
i
think
that
i
had
only
mechanics
and
imperfect
optics
this
term
no
hydrostatics
and
that
the
resumed
lectures
were
principally
optical
they
terminated
about
may
with
my
brother
i
at
once
went
to
bury
to
attend
my
funeral
he
was
buried
on
mar
in
the
churchyard
of
little
whelnetham
on
the
north
side
of
the
church
shortly
afterwards
i
went
to
london
and
on
apr
i
attended
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
at
which
herschel
produced
a
paper
regarding
improvements
of
the
nautical
almanac
herschel
and
i
were
in
fact
the
leaders
of
the
reforming
party
in
the
board
of
longitude
dr
young
the
secretary
resisted
change
as
much
as
possible
after
the
meeting
i
went
to
cambridge
i
find
then
calculations
of
achromatic
for
a
very
nice
model
with
silk
threads
of
various
colours
which
i
made
with
my
own
hands
for
my
optical
lectures
on
apr
herschel
wrote
to
me
that
the
professorship
held
by
dr
brinkley
then
appointed
bishop
of
cloyne
at
dublin
would
be
vacant
and
recommended
it
to
my
notice
and
sent
me
some
introductions
i
reached
dublin
on
apr
where
i
was
received
with
great
kindness
by
dr
brinkley
and
dr
macdonnell
afterwards
provost
i
there
met
the
then
provost
dr
bartholomew
lloyd
dr
lardner
mr
hamilton
afterwards
sir
hamilton
and
others
in
a
few
days
i
found
that
they
greatly
desired
to
appoint
hamilton
if
possible
they
did
in
fact
overcome
some
difficulties
and
appoint
him
in
a
few
months
and
that
they
would
not
make
such
an
augmentation
as
would
induce
me
to
offer
myself
as
a
candidate
and
i
withdrew
i
have
always
remembered
with
gratitude
dr
macdonnell
conduct
in
carefully
putting
me
on
a
fair
footing
in
this
matter
i
returned
by
holyhead
and
arrived
at
birmingham
on
apr
while
waiting
there
and
looking
over
some
papers
relating
to
the
spherical
aberration
of
in
which
i
had
been
stopped
some
time
by
a
geometrical
difficulty
i
did
in
the
of
a
hotel
overcome
the
difficulty
and
this
was
the
foundation
of
a
capital
paper
on
the
spherical
aberration
of
this
paper
was
afterwards
presented
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
about
this
time
a
circumstance
occurred
of
a
disagreeable
nature
which
however
did
not
much
disconcert
me
mr
ivory
who
had
a
good
many
years
before
made
himself
favourably
known
as
a
mathematician
especially
by
his
acquaintance
with
laplace
peculiar
analysis
had
adopted
as
not
unfrequently
happens
some
singular
hydrostatical
theories
in
my
last
paper
on
the
figure
of
the
earth
i
had
said
that
i
could
not
receive
one
of
his
equations
in
the
philosophical
magazine
of
may
he
attacked
me
for
this
with
great
heat
on
may
i
wrote
an
answer
and
i
think
it
soon
became
known
that
i
was
not
to
be
attacked
with
impunity
long
before
this
time
there
had
been
some
proposal
about
an
excursion
to
the
lake
district
with
my
sister
and
i
now
arranged
to
carry
it
out
on
may
i
went
to
bury
and
on
to
playford
while
there
i
sketched
the
cumberland
excursion
on
june
i
went
to
london
i
believe
to
the
visitation
of
the
greenwich
observatory
to
which
i
was
invited
i
also
attended
the
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
i
think
it
was
here
that
pond
errors
of
the
sun
place
in
the
nautical
almanac
from
greenwich
observations
were
produced
on
june
i
went
by
coach
to
rugby
where
i
met
my
sister
and
we
travelled
to
edensor
we
made
a
number
of
excursions
in
derbyshire
and
then
passed
on
by
penrith
to
keswick
where
we
arrived
on
june
from
keswick
we
made
many
excursions
in
the
lake
district
visited
mr
southey
and
mr
wordsworth
descended
a
coal
mine
at
whitehaven
and
returned
to
edensor
by
the
way
of
ambleside
kendal
and
manchester
with
sundry
excursions
in
derbyshire
our
trip
ended
and
we
returned
to
cambridge
on
the
july
during
this
long
vacation
i
had
one
private
pupil
crawford
the
only
pupil
this
year
and
the
last
that
i
ever
had
at
this
time
there
is
on
my
papers
an
infinity
of
optical
investigations
also
a
plan
of
an
with
a
concave
lens
to
destroy
certain
aberrations
on
i
went
to
woodford
to
see
messrs
gilbert
optical
works
from
i
had
been
preparing
for
the
discussion
of
the
greenwich
solar
errors
and
i
had
a
man
at
work
in
my
rooms
engaged
on
the
calculation
of
the
errors
i
wrote
to
bouvard
at
paris
for
observations
of
the
sun
but
he
recommended
me
to
wait
for
the
tables
which
bessel
was
preparing
i
was
busy
too
about
my
lectures
on
i
have
a
set
of
plans
of
printing
presses
from
hansard
the
printer
who
in
a
visit
to
cambridge
had
found
me
making
enquiries
about
them
and
i
corresponded
with
messrs
gilbert
about
optical
constructions
and
with
and
jones
eastons
and
others
about
pumps
hydraulic
rams
on
occurred
a
very
magnificent
aurora
borealis
i
do
not
find
when
the
investigation
of
corrections
of
solar
elements
was
finished
or
when
my
extracts
from
burckhardt
connaissance
des
temps
were
made
but
these
led
me
to
suspect
an
unknown
inequality
in
the
sun
motion
on
and
i
find
the
first
suspicions
of
an
inequality
depending
on
mean
longitude
of
venus
mean
longitude
of
earth
the
thing
appeared
so
promising
that
i
commenced
the
investigation
of
the
perturbation
related
to
this
term
and
continued
it
a
very
laborious
work
as
fast
as
i
was
able
though
with
various
interruptions
which
in
fact
were
necessary
to
keep
up
my
spirits
on
i
went
to
london
for
the
board
of
longitude
meeting
here
i
exhibited
the
results
of
my
sun
investigations
and
urged
the
correction
of
the
elements
used
in
the
nautical
almanac
dr
young
objected
and
proposed
that
bouvard
should
be
consulted
professor
woodhouse
the
plumian
professor
was
present
and
behaved
so
captiously
that
some
members
met
afterwards
to
consider
how
order
could
be
maintained
i
believe
it
was
during
this
visit
to
london
that
i
took
measures
of
hammersmith
suspension
bridge
for
an
intended
frequently
but
not
always
when
in
london
i
resided
at
the
house
of
mr
sheepshanks
and
his
sister
miss
sheepshanks
woburn
place
my
quires
at
this
time
abound
with
suggestions
for
lectures
and
examinations
on
some
day
about
the
end
of
november
or
beginning
of
december
when
i
was
walking
with
mr
peacock
near
the
outside
gate
of
the
trinity
walks
on
some
mention
of
woodhouse
the
plumian
professor
mr
peacock
said
that
he
was
never
likely
to
rise
into
activity
again
or
using
some
expression
importing
mortal
illness
instantly
there
had
passed
through
my
mind
the
certainty
of
my
succeeding
him
the
good
position
in
which
i
stood
towards
the
university
the
probability
of
that
position
being
improved
by
improved
lectures
and
by
increased
reputation
from
the
matters
in
which
i
was
now
engaged
the
power
of
thus
commanding
an
increase
of
income
i
should
then
have
independent
of
my
fellowship
some
competent
income
and
a
house
over
my
head
i
was
quite
aware
that
some
time
might
elapse
but
now
for
the
first
time
i
saw
my
way
clearly
the
care
of
the
observatory
had
been
for
two
or
three
years
attached
to
the
plumian
professorship
a
grace
was
immediately
prepared
entrusting
the
temporary
care
of
the
observatory
to
dr
french
to
me
mr
catton
mr
sheepshanks
and
mr
king
afterwards
master
of
queens
college
on
i
have
a
note
from
mr
king
about
going
to
the
observatory
on
my
paper
on
corrections
of
the
elements
of
the
solar
tables
was
presented
to
the
royal
society
on
at
sunday
morning
i
arrived
at
the
result
of
my
calculations
of
the
new
inequality
i
had
gone
through
some
fluctuations
of
feeling
usually
the
important
part
of
an
inequality
of
this
kind
depends
entirely
on
the
eccentricities
of
the
orbits
but
it
so
happened
that
from
the
positions
of
the
axes
of
the
orbits
these
terms
very
nearly
destroyed
each
other
after
this
came
the
consideration
of
inclinations
of
orbits
and
here
were
sensible
terms
which
were
not
destroyed
finally
i
arrived
at
the
result
that
the
inequality
would
be
about
just
such
a
magnitude
as
was
required
i
slipped
this
into
whewell
door
this
is
to
the
time
of
writing
the
last
improvement
of
any
importance
in
the
solar
theory
some
little
remaining
work
went
on
to
and
then
being
thoroughly
tired
i
laid
by
the
work
for
revision
at
some
future
time
i
however
added
a
postscript
to
my
royal
society
paper
on
solar
errors
notifying
this
result
on
i
went
to
bury
while
there
i
heard
from
whewell
that
woodhouse
was
dead
i
returned
to
cambridge
and
immediately
made
known
that
i
was
a
candidate
for
the
now
vacant
plumian
professorship
of
miscellaneous
scientific
business
i
find
that
on
professor
barlow
of
woolwich
prepared
a
memorial
to
the
board
of
longitude
concerning
his
fluid
telescope
which
i
had
seen
at
woodford
which
was
considered
on
and
i
had
some
correspondence
with
him
in
december
in
june
and
august
my
trigonometry
was
printing
on
i
came
from
london
it
seems
that
i
had
been
speculating
truly
book
on
perturbations
of
planetary
elements
for
on
and
i
wrote
a
paper
on
a
supposed
error
of
laplace
and
just
at
the
end
i
discovered
that
he
was
quite
right
i
folded
up
the
paper
and
marked
it
lesson
i
set
two
papers
of
questions
for
smith
prizes
there
being
a
deficiency
of
one
examiner
viz
the
plumian
professor
before
the
beginning
of
whewell
and
i
had
determined
on
repeating
the
dolcoath
experiments
on
i
have
a
letter
from
davies
gilbert
then
president
of
the
royal
society
congratulating
me
upon
the
solar
theory
and
alluding
to
our
intended
summer
visit
to
cornwall
we
had
somehow
applied
to
the
board
of
longitude
for
pendulums
but
dr
young
wished
to
delay
them
having
with
capt
basil
hall
concocted
a
scheme
for
making
lieut
foster
do
all
the
work
whewell
and
i
were
indignant
at
this
and
no
more
was
said
about
it
on
dr
young
in
giving
notice
of
the
board
of
longitude
meeting
informs
me
that
the
clocks
and
pendulums
are
ready
i
had
made
known
that
i
was
a
candidate
for
the
plumian
professorship
and
nobody
thought
it
worth
while
to
oppose
me
one
person
at
least
earnshaw
had
intended
to
compete
but
he
called
on
me
to
make
certain
that
i
was
a
candidate
and
immediately
withdrew
i
went
on
in
quality
of
syndic
for
the
care
of
the
observatory
ingrafting
myself
into
it
but
meantime
i
told
everybody
that
the
salary
about
was
not
sufficient
for
me
and
on
i
drafted
a
manifesto
or
application
to
the
university
for
an
increase
of
salary
the
day
of
election
to
the
professorship
was
as
i
was
officially
as
lucasian
professor
an
elector
i
was
present
and
i
explained
to
the
electors
that
i
could
not
undertake
the
responsibility
of
the
observatory
without
augmentation
of
income
and
that
i
requested
their
express
sanction
to
my
application
to
the
university
for
that
purpose
they
agreed
to
this
generally
and
i
was
elected
i
went
to
london
immediately
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
and
returned
on
on
i
began
my
lectures
which
this
year
included
mechanics
optics
pneumatics
and
hydrostatics
in
the
room
below
the
university
library
the
number
of
names
was
the
lectures
terminated
on
mar
on
i
received
from
mr
pond
information
on
the
emoluments
at
greenwich
observatory
i
drew
up
a
second
manifesto
and
on
i
wrote
and
signed
a
formal
copy
for
the
plumian
electors
on
i
met
them
at
caius
lodge
the
master
dr
davy
being
i
read
my
paper
which
was
approved
and
their
sanction
was
given
in
the
form
of
a
request
to
the
to
permit
the
paper
to
be
printed
and
circulated
my
paper
with
this
request
at
the
head
was
immediately
printed
and
a
copy
was
sent
to
every
resident
more
than
went
out
in
one
day
the
statement
and
composition
of
the
paper
were
generally
approved
but
the
university
had
never
before
been
taken
by
storm
in
such
a
manner
and
there
was
some
commotion
about
it
i
believe
that
very
few
persons
would
have
taken
the
same
step
mr
sheepshanks
wrote
to
me
on
mar
intimating
that
it
was
desperate
i
had
no
doubt
of
success
whewell
told
me
that
some
people
accused
me
of
bad
faith
in
omitting
allusion
to
the
a
year
received
as
member
of
the
board
of
longitude
and
to
the
profits
of
lectures
i
wrote
him
a
note
telling
him
that
i
had
most
certain
information
of
the
intention
to
dissolve
the
board
of
longitude
which
was
done
in
less
than
six
months
and
that
by
two
years
lectures
i
had
gained
the
expenses
being
receipts
this
letter
was
sent
to
the
complaining
people
and
no
more
was
said
by
the
activity
of
sheepshanks
and
the
kindness
of
dr
davy
the
business
gradually
grew
into
shape
and
on
mar
a
grace
passed
the
senate
for
appointing
a
syndicate
to
consider
of
augmentation
sheepshanks
was
one
of
the
syndicate
and
was
understood
to
represent
in
some
measure
my
interests
the
progress
of
the
syndicate
however
was
by
no
means
a
straightforward
one
members
of
the
senate
soon
began
to
remark
that
before
giving
anything
they
ought
to
know
the
amount
of
the
university
revenue
and
another
syndicate
was
then
appointed
to
enquire
and
report
upon
it
it
was
more
than
a
year
before
my
syndicate
could
make
their
recommendation
however
in
fact
i
lost
nothing
by
that
delay
as
i
was
rising
in
the
estimation
of
the
university
the
observatory
house
was
furnished
partly
from
woodhouse
sale
and
partly
from
new
furniture
my
mother
and
sister
came
to
live
with
me
there
on
mar
i
began
the
observatory
journal
on
mar
i
slept
at
the
observatory
for
the
first
time
and
on
apr
i
came
to
reside
there
permanently
and
gave
up
my
college
rooms
chapter
iv
at
cambridge
observatory
from
his
taking
charge
of
the
cambridge
observatory
to
his
residence
at
greenwich
observatory
as
astronomer
royal
from
march
to
i
attended
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
longitude
on
apr
and
again
on
june
this
was
the
last
meeting
sheepshanks
had
previously
given
me
private
information
of
the
certainty
of
its
on
apr
i
visited
mr
herschel
at
slough
where
one
evening
i
saw
saturn
with
his
telescope
the
best
view
of
it
that
i
have
ever
in
june
i
attended
the
greenwich
observatory
before
my
election
as
plumian
professor
there
are
various
schemes
on
my
quires
for
computation
of
transit
corrections
after
apr
there
are
corrections
for
deficient
wires
inequality
of
pivots
and
i
began
a
book
of
proposed
regulations
for
observations
in
this
are
plans
for
groups
of
stars
for
the
transit
instrument
being
the
only
one
finished
order
of
preference
of
classes
of
observations
no
reductions
to
be
made
after
dinner
or
on
sunday
no
loose
papers
observations
to
be
stopped
if
reductions
are
two
months
in
arrear
stars
selected
for
the
reduction
of
transits
begins
on
apr
on
may
mr
pond
sent
me
some
to
aid
in
determining
my
dr
young
in
a
letter
to
me
of
may
enquires
whether
i
will
accept
a
free
admission
to
the
royal
society
which
i
declined
on
may
i
was
elected
to
the
astronomical
towards
the
end
of
the
year
i
observed
encke
comet
and
determined
the
latitude
of
the
observatory
with
sheepshanks
repeating
on
my
papers
i
find
a
sketch
of
an
article
on
the
figure
of
the
earth
for
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
as
early
as
i
had
been
in
correspondence
with
jones
the
about
pendulums
for
a
repetition
of
the
dolcoath
experiments
invitations
had
been
received
and
everything
was
arranged
with
whewell
sheepshanks
my
brother
and
mr
jackson
of
ipswich
caius
coll
were
to
go
and
we
were
subsequently
joined
by
sedgwick
and
lodge
magdalene
on
july
sheepshanks
and
i
started
by
salisbury
taking
sherborne
on
our
way
to
look
at
the
church
which
had
alarmed
the
people
by
signs
of
a
crack
and
arrived
at
camborne
on
july
on
the
we
set
up
the
pendulums
and
at
once
commenced
observations
our
plan
being
to
have
no
intermission
in
the
pendulum
observations
so
that
as
soon
as
the
arc
became
too
small
a
fresh
series
was
started
on
july
we
raised
the
instruments
and
sheepshanks
who
managed
much
of
the
upper
operations
both
astronomical
and
of
pendulums
mounted
the
pendulums
together
in
his
observatory
we
went
on
with
our
calculations
and
on
august
on
returning
from
a
visit
to
john
williams
at
barncoose
we
heard
that
there
was
a
in
dolcoath
that
is
a
sinking
of
the
whole
mass
of
rock
where
it
had
been
set
free
by
the
mine
excavations
probably
only
a
few
inches
but
enough
to
break
the
rock
much
and
to
stop
the
pumps
on
the
calculations
of
our
observations
shewed
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
on
the
i
perceived
an
anomaly
in
the
form
of
the
knife
edge
of
one
pendulum
and
of
its
agate
planes
and
suggested
cautions
for
repeating
the
observations
we
determined
at
once
to
repeat
them
and
as
the
water
was
rising
in
the
mine
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
we
again
sent
the
instruments
down
and
made
observations
on
the
and
on
the
i
sent
the
instruments
up
for
the
water
was
near
our
station
and
sedgwick
whewell
and
i
went
on
a
geological
expedition
to
the
lizard
on
our
return
we
met
sheepshanks
and
the
others
and
found
the
results
of
the
last
observations
unsatisfactory
the
results
of
comparing
the
pendulums
were
discordant
and
the
knife
edge
of
the
faulty
pendulum
had
very
sensibly
altered
we
now
gave
up
observations
with
the
feeling
that
our
time
had
been
totally
lost
mainly
through
the
fault
of
the
maker
of
the
pendulum
jones
on
the
we
made
an
expedition
to
penzance
and
other
places
and
arrived
at
cambridge
on
the
of
september
in
the
course
of
the
work
at
dolcoath
we
made
various
expeditions
as
opportunity
offered
thus
we
walked
to
carn
brea
and
witnessed
the
wrestling
the
common
game
of
the
country
on
another
occasion
sedgwick
whewell
and
i
had
a
capital
geological
expedition
to
trewavas
head
to
examine
granite
veins
we
visited
at
pendarves
and
trevince
and
made
the
expedition
to
the
lizard
already
referred
to
and
saw
many
of
the
sights
in
the
neighbourhood
after
visiting
penzance
on
the
conclusion
of
our
work
we
saw
cape
cornwall
where
whewell
overturned
me
in
a
gig
and
returned
homewards
by
way
of
truro
plymouth
where
we
saw
the
and
breakwater
also
the
dockyard
and
descended
in
one
of
the
working
exeter
salisbury
and
portsmouth
in
returning
from
camborne
in
i
lost
the
principal
of
our
papers
it
was
an
odd
thing
that
in
going
through
exeter
on
our
way
to
camborne
in
i
found
them
complete
at
exeter
identified
to
the
custodian
by
the
dropping
out
of
a
letter
with
my
address
on
my
return
to
cambridge
i
was
immediately
immersed
in
the
work
of
the
observatory
the
only
instrument
then
mounted
at
the
observatory
was
the
transit
i
had
no
assistant
a
mr
galbraith
of
edinburgh
had
questioned
something
in
one
of
my
papers
about
the
figure
of
the
earth
i
drew
up
a
rather
formal
answer
to
it
whewell
saw
my
draft
and
drew
up
a
much
more
pithy
one
which
i
adopted
and
sent
to
the
philosophical
for
comparing
our
clocks
at
the
upper
and
lower
stations
of
dolcoath
we
had
borrowed
from
the
royal
observatory
greenwich
six
good
pocket
chronometers
they
were
still
in
the
care
of
mr
sheepshanks
i
arranged
with
him
that
they
should
be
sent
backwards
and
forwards
a
few
times
for
determining
the
longitude
of
cambridge
observatory
this
was
done
on
the
result
was
and
this
has
been
used
to
the
present
time
it
evinced
an
error
in
the
trigonometrical
survey
the
origin
of
which
was
found
i
think
afterwards
dr
pearson
in
a
letter
of
spoke
of
the
mistake
of
a
for
a
i
drew
up
a
paper
on
this
and
gave
it
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
on
my
only
academical
paper
this
year
i
had
several
letters
from
dr
young
partly
supplying
me
with
calculations
that
i
wanted
partly
on
reform
or
extension
of
the
nautical
almanac
which
dr
young
resisted
as
much
as
possible
he
considered
me
very
unfairly
treated
in
the
dissolution
of
the
board
of
longitude
professor
lax
wished
me
to
join
in
some
effort
for
its
restoration
but
i
declined
as
my
reduction
of
observations
was
kept
quite
close
i
now
began
to
think
of
printing
in
regard
to
the
form
i
determined
to
adopt
a
plan
totally
different
from
that
of
any
other
observations
which
i
had
seen
the
results
were
to
be
the
important
things
i
was
desirous
of
suppressing
the
separate
wires
of
transits
but
upon
consulting
herschel
and
other
persons
they
would
not
agree
to
it
and
i
assented
to
keeping
them
i
applied
to
the
press
syndicate
to
print
the
work
and
on
at
the
request
of
musgrave
afterwards
archbishop
of
york
i
sent
a
specimen
of
my
on
they
granted
copies
and
the
printing
soon
commenced
during
a
winter
holiday
at
playford
i
wrote
out
some
investigations
about
the
orbits
of
comets
and
on
i
returned
to
cambridge
the
smith
prize
examination
soon
followed
in
which
i
set
a
paper
of
questions
as
usual
on
i
made
notes
on
liesganig
geodetic
work
at
the
british
museum
i
was
naturally
anxious
now
about
the
settlement
of
my
salary
and
of
the
observatory
establishment
i
do
not
know
when
the
syndicate
made
their
report
but
it
must
have
been
in
the
last
term
of
it
recommended
that
the
salary
should
be
annually
made
up
by
grace
to
that
an
assistant
should
be
appointed
with
the
assent
of
the
and
dismissable
by
the
plumian
professor
and
that
a
visiting
syndicate
should
be
appointed
partly
official
and
partly
of
persons
to
be
named
every
year
by
grace
the
grace
for
adopting
this
report
was
to
be
offered
to
the
senate
on
the
passing
of
the
grace
was
exposed
to
two
considerable
perils
first
i
found
out
just
in
time
that
a
senior
fellow
of
trinity
browne
was
determined
to
oppose
the
whole
on
account
of
the
insignificant
clause
regarding
dismissal
of
assistants
which
he
regarded
as
tyrannical
i
at
once
undertook
that
that
clause
should
be
rejected
secondly
by
the
absurd
constitution
of
the
at
cambridge
a
single
had
the
power
of
stopping
any
business
whatever
and
an
actually
came
to
the
senate
house
with
the
intention
of
throwing
out
all
the
graces
on
various
business
that
day
presented
to
the
senate
luckily
he
mistook
the
hour
and
came
at
instead
of
and
found
that
all
were
dispatched
the
important
parts
of
the
grace
passed
without
any
opposition
but
i
mustered
some
friends
who
negatived
that
part
which
had
alarmed
browne
and
it
was
corrected
to
his
satisfaction
by
a
new
grace
on
mar
i
was
now
almost
set
at
rest
on
one
of
the
great
objects
of
my
life
but
not
quite
i
did
not
regard
and
i
determined
not
to
regard
the
addition
to
my
salary
as
absolutely
certain
until
a
payment
had
been
actually
made
to
me
and
i
carefully
abstained
for
the
present
from
taking
any
steps
based
upon
it
i
found
for
assistant
at
the
observatory
an
old
lieutenant
of
the
royal
navy
mr
baldrey
who
came
on
mar
on
may
i
began
lectures
there
were
names
the
lectures
were
improving
especially
in
the
optical
part
i
do
not
find
note
of
the
day
of
i
do
not
know
the
actual
day
of
publication
of
my
first
small
volume
of
cambridge
observations
and
of
circulation
the
date
of
the
preface
is
apr
i
have
letters
of
approval
of
it
from
davies
gilbert
rigaud
and
lax
the
system
which
i
endeavoured
to
introduce
into
printed
astronomical
observations
was
partially
introduced
into
this
volume
and
was
steadily
improved
in
subsequent
volumes
i
think
that
i
am
justified
by
letters
and
other
remarks
in
believing
that
this
introduction
of
an
orderly
system
of
exhibition
not
merely
of
observations
but
of
the
steps
for
bringing
them
to
a
practical
result
quite
a
novelty
in
astronomical
publications
had
a
markedly
good
effect
on
european
astronomy
in
in
and
march
i
have
letters
from
young
about
the
nautical
almanac
he
was
unwilling
to
make
any
great
change
but
glad
to
receive
any
small
assistance
south
who
had
been
keeping
up
a
series
of
attacks
on
young
wrote
to
me
to
enquire
how
i
stood
in
engagements
of
assistance
to
young
i
replied
that
i
should
assist
young
whenever
he
asked
me
and
that
i
disapproved
of
the
date
of
the
first
visitation
of
the
cambridge
observatory
must
have
been
near
may
i
invited
south
and
baily
to
my
house
south
and
i
were
very
near
quarrelling
about
the
treatment
of
in
a
few
days
after
dr
young
died
i
applied
to
lord
melville
for
the
superintendence
of
the
nautical
almanac
mr
croker
replied
that
it
devolved
legally
upon
the
astronomer
royal
and
on
may
pond
wrote
to
ask
my
assistance
when
i
could
give
any
on
june
i
was
invited
to
the
greenwich
visitation
to
which
i
believe
i
went
on
the
i
had
long
desired
to
see
switzerland
and
i
wished
now
to
see
some
of
the
continental
observatories
i
was
therefore
glad
to
arrange
with
mr
lodge
of
magdalene
college
perhaps
years
senior
to
myself
to
make
a
little
tour
capt
smyth
and
others
gave
me
introductions
i
met
lodge
in
london
and
we
started
for
calais
on
july
we
visited
a
number
of
towns
in
belgium
at
brussels
i
saw
the
beginning
of
the
observatory
with
quetelet
and
passed
by
cologne
frankfort
fribourg
and
basle
to
zurich
thus
far
we
had
travelled
by
diligence
or
posting
we
now
procured
a
guide
and
travelled
generally
on
foot
from
the
to
the
august
we
travelled
diligently
through
the
mountainous
parts
of
switzerland
and
arrived
at
geneva
on
the
august
here
i
saw
gautier
gambard
and
the
beginning
of
the
observatory
mr
lodge
was
now
compelled
to
return
to
cambridge
and
i
proceeded
alone
by
chambéry
to
turin
where
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
plana
and
saw
the
observatory
i
then
made
a
tour
through
north
italy
looking
over
the
observatories
at
milan
padua
bologna
and
florence
at
leghorn
i
took
a
passage
for
marseille
in
a
xebeque
but
after
sailing
for
three
days
the
weather
proved
very
unfavourable
and
i
landed
at
spezia
and
proceeded
by
genoa
and
the
cornici
road
to
marseille
at
marseille
i
saw
gambart
and
the
observatory
and
passed
by
avignon
lyons
and
nevers
to
orléans
where
i
visited
my
old
host
legarde
thence
by
paris
beauvais
and
calais
to
london
and
cambridge
where
i
arrived
on
the
october
i
had
started
with
more
than
and
returned
with
the
expedition
was
in
many
ways
invaluable
to
me
on
my
return
i
found
various
letters
from
scientific
men
some
approving
of
my
method
for
the
mass
of
the
moon
some
approving
highly
of
my
printed
observations
especially
gilbert
who
informed
me
that
they
had
produced
good
effect
i
believe
at
greenwich
and
on
i
gave
the
royal
astronomical
society
a
paper
about
deducing
the
mass
of
the
moon
from
observations
of
venus
on
a
paper
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
on
a
correction
to
the
length
of
a
and
on
a
paper
on
certain
conditions
under
which
perpetual
motion
is
the
engravings
for
my
figure
of
the
earth
in
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
were
dispatched
at
the
end
of
the
year
some
of
the
paper
perhaps
much
was
written
after
my
return
from
the
i
began
but
never
finished
a
paper
on
the
form
of
the
earth
supposed
to
be
projecting
at
middle
latitudes
in
this
i
refer
to
the
printed
paper
which
nicollet
gave
me
at
paris
i
believe
that
the
investigations
for
my
paper
in
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
led
me
to
think
the
supposition
on
i
was
elected
member
of
the
geological
society
on
notice
was
given
of
a
grace
to
authorize
payment
to
me
of
in
conformity
with
the
regulations
adopted
on
and
on
the
grace
passed
the
senate
on
the
wrote
me
a
note
enclosing
the
cheque
on
practically
the
first
day
on
which
i
could
go
i
went
to
london
and
travelled
to
edensor
where
i
arrived
on
the
here
i
found
richarda
smith
proposed
to
her
and
was
accepted
i
stayed
there
a
few
days
and
returned
to
cambridge
on
the
smith
prize
paper
was
prepared
i
was
with
my
assistant
mr
baldrey
vigorously
working
the
transit
instrument
and
its
reductions
and
gradually
forming
a
course
of
proceeding
which
has
had
a
good
effect
on
european
astronomy
and
i
was
preparing
for
my
marriage
on
mar
i
started
with
my
sister
to
london
and
arrived
at
edensor
on
the
afternoon
of
the
on
the
i
started
alone
for
manchester
and
liverpool
through
mr
mason
a
at
calver
near
edensor
i
had
become
acquainted
with
mr
john
kennedy
of
manchester
and
i
had
since
been
acquainted
with
dr
traill
of
liverpool
amongst
other
things
i
saw
the
works
of
the
manchester
and
liverpool
railway
then
advancing
and
exciting
great
interest
and
saw
george
stephenson
and
his
son
on
mar
i
was
married
to
richarda
smith
by
her
father
in
edensor
we
stopped
at
edensor
till
apr
and
then
started
in
chaises
by
way
of
newark
and
kettering
where
we
were
in
danger
of
being
stopped
by
the
snow
and
arrived
at
cambridge
on
apr
i
was
now
busy
in
preparing
for
lectures
especially
the
part
of
the
optical
lectures
which
related
to
the
theory
of
interferences
and
polarization
i
think
it
was
now
that
my
wife
drew
some
of
my
lecture
pictures
exhibiting
interference
phenomena
my
lectures
began
on
apr
and
finished
on
may
the
number
of
names
was
they
were
considered
an
excellent
course
of
lectures
may
is
the
date
of
my
preface
to
the
observations
all
was
then
printed
apparently
i
did
not
go
to
the
visitation
of
the
greenwich
observatory
this
i
was
at
this
time
pressing
tulley
the
optician
about
an
for
the
mural
a
new
edition
of
my
was
wanted
and
i
prepared
to
add
a
tract
on
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
in
its
utmost
extent
the
syndicate
of
the
university
press
intimated
through
dr
turton
that
they
could
not
assist
me
regarding
the
book
as
a
second
edition
on
july
i
have
some
negociation
about
it
with
deighton
the
on
may
i
have
a
note
from
whewell
about
a
number
of
crystals
of
plagiedral
quartz
in
which
he
was
to
observe
the
crystalline
indication
and
i
the
optical
the
report
of
the
syndicate
for
visiting
the
observatory
is
dated
june
it
is
highly
the
proctor
barnard
of
king
college
requested
me
to
name
the
moderator
for
the
next
examination
i
named
mr
challis
on
june
my
wife
and
i
went
in
company
with
professor
and
mrs
henslow
to
london
and
oxford
at
oxford
we
were
received
in
christchurch
college
by
dr
and
mrs
buckland
my
wife
and
i
then
went
to
bedford
to
visit
capt
and
mrs
smyth
and
returned
to
cambridge
on
the
on
july
we
went
on
a
visit
to
my
mother
and
uncle
at
playford
while
there
i
took
a
drive
with
my
uncle
into
some
parts
near
the
valley
of
the
gipping
in
which
i
thought
that
the
extent
of
the
chalk
was
inadequately
exhibited
on
greenough
map
and
communicated
my
remarks
to
buckland
i
find
letters
from
dr
robinson
and
colby
about
determining
longitudes
of
certain
observatories
by
fire
signals
i
proposed
chronometers
as
preferable
also
from
herschel
approving
of
my
second
volume
of
observations
and
from
baily
disclaiming
the
origination
of
the
attack
on
the
old
nautical
almanac
with
which
i
suppose
i
had
reproached
him
on
july
i
received
a
summons
from
south
to
a
committee
for
improving
the
nautical
almanac
and
subsequently
a
letter
from
baily
about
schumacher
taking
offence
at
a
passage
of
mine
in
the
cambridge
observations
on
the
comparative
merits
of
ephemerides
which
i
afterwards
explained
to
his
satisfaction
on
my
wife
and
i
started
for
edensor
and
after
a
short
stay
there
proceeded
by
manchester
to
cumberland
where
we
made
many
excursions
we
returned
by
edensor
and
reached
cambridge
on
bringing
my
wife
sister
susanna
on
a
visit
my
mother
had
determined
as
soon
as
my
intention
of
marriage
was
known
to
her
to
quit
the
house
although
always
even
to
her
death
entertaining
the
most
friendly
feelings
and
fondness
for
my
wife
it
was
also
judged
best
by
us
all
that
my
sister
should
not
reside
with
us
as
a
settled
inhabitant
of
the
house
they
fixed
themselves
therefore
at
playford
in
the
of
the
luck
farm
then
in
the
occupation
of
my
uncle
arthur
biddell
on
i
have
a
letter
from
my
sister
saying
that
they
were
comfortably
settled
there
in
this
month
of
october
principally
i
believe
i
made
some
capital
experiments
on
quartz
which
were
treated
mathematically
in
a
paper
communicated
in
the
next
year
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
in
some
of
these
my
wife
assisted
me
and
also
drew
on
the
grace
for
paying
me
to
make
my
income
up
to
passed
the
i
made
three
journeys
to
london
to
attend
committees
one
a
committee
on
the
nautical
almanac
and
one
a
royal
society
committee
about
two
southern
on
i
have
a
letter
from
maclear
medical
practitioner
and
astronomer
at
biggleswade
about
in
this
december
i
had
a
quartz
by
cauchaix
mounted
by
dollond
and
presented
it
to
the
in
this
december
occurred
the
alarm
from
agrarian
fires
there
was
a
very
large
fire
at
coton
about
a
mile
from
the
observatory
this
created
the
most
extraordinary
panic
that
i
ever
saw
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
without
having
witnessed
it
to
conceive
the
state
of
men
minds
the
gownsmen
were
all
armed
with
bludgeons
and
put
under
a
rude
discipline
for
a
few
days
on
i
went
with
my
wife
first
to
miss
sheepshanks
in
london
at
woburn
place
and
next
to
the
house
of
my
wife
old
friend
the
rev
john
courtney
at
sanderstead
near
croydon
i
came
to
london
on
one
day
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
new
board
of
visitors
of
the
greenwich
observatory
formerly
the
board
of
visitors
consisted
of
the
council
of
the
royal
society
with
persons
invited
by
them
in
which
capacity
i
had
often
attended
but
a
reforming
party
of
which
south
babbage
baily
and
beaufort
were
prominent
members
had
induced
the
admiralty
to
constitute
a
new
board
of
which
the
plumian
professor
was
a
member
mr
pond
the
astronomer
royal
was
in
a
rather
feeble
state
and
south
seemed
determined
to
bear
him
down
sheepshanks
and
i
did
our
best
to
support
him
i
have
various
letters
from
sheepshanks
to
this
purpose
on
we
returned
to
cambridge
and
i
set
an
examination
paper
for
smith
prizes
as
on
i
have
a
letter
from
herschel
about
improving
the
arrangement
of
pond
observations
i
believe
that
much
of
this
zeal
arose
from
the
example
of
the
cambridge
observations
on
my
paper
the
nature
of
the
light
in
the
two
rays
of
quartz
was
communicated
to
the
philosophical
society
a
capital
piece
of
deductive
optics
on
mar
i
went
to
london
i
suppose
to
attend
the
board
of
visitors
which
met
frequently
for
the
proposed
reform
of
pond
observations
as
i
returned
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
there
occurred
to
me
a
very
remarkable
deduction
from
my
ideas
about
the
rays
of
quartz
which
i
soon
tried
with
success
and
it
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
the
paper
above
mentioned
on
mar
my
son
george
richard
was
born
miscellaneous
matters
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
are
as
follows
faraday
sends
me
a
piece
of
glass
for
amici
he
had
sent
me
a
piece
before
on
apr
i
dispatched
the
preface
of
my
observations
this
implies
that
all
was
on
apr
i
began
my
lectures
and
finished
on
may
there
were
names
a
very
good
series
of
i
think
it
was
immediately
after
this
at
the
visitation
of
the
cambridge
observatory
that
baily
and
lieut
stratford
were
present
and
that
sheepshanks
went
to
tharfield
on
the
royston
downs
to
fire
powder
signals
to
be
seen
at
biggleswade
by
maclear
and
at
bedford
by
capt
smyth
as
well
as
by
us
at
on
may
i
received
for
my
article
on
the
figure
of
the
earth
from
baldwin
the
publisher
of
the
encyclopaedia
i
attended
the
greenwich
visitation
on
june
on
june
the
observatory
syndicate
made
their
report
satisfactory
on
july
i
started
with
my
wife
and
infant
son
for
edensor
and
went
on
alone
to
liverpool
i
left
for
dublin
on
the
day
on
which
the
loss
of
the
castle
was
telegraphed
and
had
a
bad
voyage
which
made
me
ill
during
my
whole
absence
after
a
little
stay
in
dublin
i
went
to
armagh
to
visit
dr
robinson
and
thence
to
coleraine
and
the
giant
causeway
returning
by
belfast
and
dublin
to
edensor
we
returned
to
cambridge
on
up
to
this
time
the
observatory
was
furnished
with
only
one
large
instrument
namely
the
transit
on
of
this
year
i
had
received
from
thomas
jones
charing
cross
a
sketch
of
the
stone
pier
for
mounting
the
equatoreal
which
he
was
commissioned
to
make
and
the
pier
was
prepared
in
the
spring
or
summer
on
part
of
the
instrument
was
sent
to
the
observatory
other
parts
followed
and
jones
himself
came
to
mount
it
on
i
received
simms
assurance
that
he
was
hastening
the
mural
in
this
autumn
i
seriously
took
up
the
recalculation
of
my
long
inequality
of
venus
and
the
earth
and
worked
through
it
independently
thus
correcting
two
errors
on
i
went
to
slough
to
put
my
paper
in
the
hands
of
mr
herschel
for
communication
to
the
royal
society
the
paper
was
read
on
nov
this
was
the
year
of
the
first
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
york
the
next
meeting
was
to
be
at
oxford
and
on
i
received
from
the
rev
vernon
harcourt
an
invitation
to
supply
a
report
on
astronomy
which
i
undertook
it
employed
me
much
of
the
winter
and
the
succeeding
spring
and
the
second
edition
of
my
tracts
was
ready
in
october
it
contained
besides
what
was
in
the
first
edition
the
planetary
theory
and
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
the
profit
was
on
i
presented
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
a
paper
a
remarkable
modification
of
newton
rings
a
pretty
good
in
november
the
copley
medal
was
awarded
to
me
by
the
royal
society
for
my
advances
in
amongst
miscellaneous
matters
i
was
engaged
in
correspondence
with
colby
and
capt
portlock
about
the
irish
triangulation
and
its
calculation
also
with
the
admiralty
on
the
form
of
publication
of
the
greenwich
and
cape
observations
in
january
my
examination
paper
for
smith
prizes
was
prepared
as
two
matters
in
addition
to
the
daily
routine
of
observatory
work
occupied
me
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
one
was
the
translation
of
encke
paper
in
successive
numbers
of
the
astronomische
nachrichten
concerning
encke
comet
the
university
press
printed
this
gratuitously
and
i
distributed
copies
partly
by
the
aid
of
capt
the
other
was
the
report
on
astronomy
for
the
british
association
which
required
much
labour
my
reading
for
it
was
principally
in
the
university
library
possibly
some
in
london
but
i
borrowed
some
books
from
baily
and
i
wrote
to
capt
beaufort
about
the
possible
repetition
of
lacaille
meridian
arc
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
report
appears
to
have
been
finished
on
may
at
this
time
the
reform
bill
was
under
discussion
and
one
letter
written
by
me
probably
at
sheepshanks
request
addressed
i
think
to
mr
drummond
lord
althorp
secretary
was
read
in
the
house
of
commons
optics
were
not
neglected
i
have
some
correspondence
with
brewster
and
faraday
on
mar
i
gave
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
a
paper
a
new
analyzer
and
on
mar
one
newton
rings
between
two
substances
of
different
refractive
powers
both
papers
satisfactory
to
on
the
death
of
mr
fallows
astronomer
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
observatory
the
admiralty
appointed
mr
henderson
an
edinburgh
lawyer
who
had
done
some
little
things
in
astronomical
calculation
on
i
discussed
with
him
observations
to
be
made
and
drew
up
his
official
instructions
which
were
sent
on
jan
on
sir
james
south
writes
that
encke
comet
is
seen
also
that
with
his
achromatic
purchased
at
paris
and
which
he
was
preparing
to
mount
equatoreally
he
had
seen
the
disk
of
aldebaran
apparently
bisected
by
the
capt
beaufort
and
gilbert
write
in
march
about
instructions
to
dunlop
the
astronomer
at
paramatta
i
sent
a
draft
to
capt
beaufort
on
apr
the
preface
to
my
observations
is
dated
mar
the
distribution
of
the
book
would
be
a
few
weeks
on
may
i
began
my
lectures
names
i
finished
on
may
the
mounting
of
the
equatoreal
was
finished
some
time
before
the
syndicate
visitation
at
the
end
of
may
but
jones
charge
appeared
to
be
exorbitant
i
believe
it
was
paid
at
last
but
it
was
considered
on
june
i
went
to
london
i
presume
to
the
greenwich
i
went
to
oxford
to
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
lodging
i
think
with
rigaud
at
the
observatory
on
june
and
read
part
of
my
report
on
astronomy
in
the
theatre
on
june
i
started
with
my
wife
for
the
highlands
of
scotland
after
a
short
stay
at
edensor
we
went
by
carlisle
to
glasgow
and
through
the
lake
district
to
inverness
thence
by
auchnanault
to
balmacarra
where
we
were
received
by
mr
lillingstone
after
an
expedition
in
skye
we
returned
to
balmacarra
and
passed
on
to
invermoriston
where
we
were
received
by
grant
of
glenmoriston
we
then
went
to
fort
william
and
oban
and
crossed
over
to
mull
where
we
were
received
by
maclean
of
loch
buy
we
returned
to
oban
and
on
to
edinburgh
where
we
made
a
short
stay
then
to
melrose
where
we
were
received
by
sir
brewster
and
by
edensor
to
cambridge
where
we
arrived
on
i
received
at
edinburgh
i
believe
a
letter
from
arago
writing
for
the
plans
of
our
mr
vernon
harcourt
wrote
deprecating
the
tone
of
my
report
on
astronomy
as
related
to
english
astronomers
but
i
refused
to
alter
a
sheepshanks
wrote
in
september
in
great
anxiety
about
the
cambridge
circle
for
which
he
thought
the
pier
ought
to
be
raised
i
would
have
no
such
thing
and
arranged
it
much
more
conveniently
by
means
of
a
pit
on
simms
says
that
he
will
come
with
the
circle
immediately
and
jones
on
says
that
he
will
make
some
alteration
in
the
equatoreal
thus
there
was
at
last
a
prospect
of
furnishing
the
observatory
on
i
have
encke
thanks
for
the
translation
of
the
comet
one
of
the
desiderata
which
i
had
pointed
out
in
my
report
on
astronomy
was
the
determination
of
the
mass
of
jupiter
by
elongations
of
the
satellite
and
as
the
equatoreal
of
the
cambridge
observatory
was
on
the
point
of
coming
into
use
i
determined
to
employ
it
for
this
purpose
it
was
necessary
for
the
reduction
of
the
observations
that
i
should
prepare
tables
of
the
motion
of
jupiter
satellite
in
a
form
applicable
to
computations
of
differences
of
the
date
of
my
tables
is
in
october
the
observatory
syndicate
made
their
report
quite
satisfactory
on
sheepshanks
wrote
asking
my
assistance
in
the
penny
cyclopaedia
i
did
afterwards
write
and
capt
beaufort
wrote
in
november
to
ask
my
opinion
on
the
preface
to
an
edition
of
groombridge
catalogue
which
had
been
prepared
by
taylor
sheepshanks
also
wrote
he
had
objected
to
it
this
was
the
beginning
of
an
affair
which
afterwards
gave
me
great
vernon
harcourt
writes
much
offended
at
some
terms
which
i
had
used
in
reference
to
an
office
in
the
british
association
the
equatoreal
mounting
which
troughton
and
simms
had
been
preparing
for
sir
james
south
large
telescope
had
not
entirely
succeeded
i
have
various
letters
at
this
time
from
sheepshanks
and
simms
relating
to
the
disposition
which
sir
james
south
shewed
to
resist
every
claim
till
compelled
by
law
to
pay
a
general
election
of
members
of
parliament
was
now
coming
on
mr
lubbock
was
candidate
for
the
university
on
i
had
a
letter
from
sedgwick
requesting
me
to
write
a
letter
in
the
newspapers
in
favour
of
lubbock
which
i
did
on
i
have
notice
of
the
county
voting
at
newmarket
on
and
i
walked
there
to
vote
for
townley
he
lost
the
election
by
two
or
three
votes
in
several
thousands
the
mural
circle
was
now
nearly
ready
in
all
respects
and
it
was
known
that
another
assistant
would
be
required
mr
richardson
one
of
the
assistants
of
greenwich
observatory
and
mr
simms
recommended
to
me
mr
glaisher
who
was
soon
after
appointed
and
subsequently
became
an
assistant
at
on
i
have
a
letter
from
bessel
the
first
i
believe
i
think
that
i
had
written
to
him
about
a
general
reduction
of
the
greenwich
planetary
observations
using
his
tabulae
regiomontanae
as
basis
and
that
this
was
his
reply
approving
of
it
on
my
daughter
elizabeth
was
i
prepared
an
examination
paper
for
smith
prizes
as
on
i
received
notice
from
simms
that
he
had
received
payment
for
the
mural
circle
from
the
about
this
time
the
circle
was
completely
made
serviceable
and
i
with
mr
glaisher
as
assistant
immediately
began
its
use
a
puzzling
apparent
defect
in
the
circle
exhibiting
itself
by
the
discordance
of
zenith
points
obtained
by
reflection
observations
on
opposite
sides
of
the
zenith
shewed
itself
very
early
on
i
have
letters
about
it
from
sheepshanks
and
on
i
received
notice
from
baily
that
the
astronomical
society
had
awarded
me
their
medal
for
my
long
inequality
of
venus
and
the
earth
on
i
went
to
london
i
suppose
to
receive
the
i
also
inspected
sir
j
south
telescope
then
becoming
a
matter
of
litigation
and
visited
mr
herschel
at
slough
on
i
wrote
to
sir
j
south
about
the
support
of
the
instrument
hoping
to
remove
one
of
the
difficulties
in
the
litigation
but
it
produced
no
herschel
wrote
to
me
from
poisson
that
pontécoulant
had
verified
my
long
inequality
mar
is
the
date
of
the
preface
to
my
volume
of
observations
it
was
of
course
distributed
a
few
weeks
in
my
report
on
astronomy
i
had
indicated
the
mass
of
jupiter
as
a
subject
requiring
fresh
investigation
during
the
last
winter
i
had
well
employed
the
equatoreal
in
observing
elongations
in
of
the
satellite
to
make
these
available
it
was
necessary
to
work
up
the
theory
carefully
in
which
i
discovered
some
remarkable
errors
of
laplace
some
of
these
for
verification
i
submitted
to
mr
lubbock
who
entirely
agreed
with
me
the
date
of
my
first
calculations
of
the
mass
of
jupiter
is
mar
and
shortly
after
that
i
gave
an
oral
account
of
them
to
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
the
date
of
my
paper
for
the
astronomical
society
is
april
the
result
of
my
investigations
which
was
subsequently
confirmed
by
bessel
entirely
removed
the
difficulty
among
astronomers
and
the
mass
which
i
obtained
has
ever
since
been
received
as
the
true
one
on
apr
my
wife
two
sisters
elizabeth
and
georgiana
smith
came
to
stay
with
on
apr
i
began
lectures
and
finished
on
may
there
were
names
during
the
course
of
the
lectures
i
communicated
a
paper
to
the
philosophical
society
the
calculation
of
newton
experiments
on
diffraction
i
went
to
london
on
the
visitation
of
the
greenwich
observatory
the
dinner
had
been
much
restricted
but
was
now
made
more
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
was
to
be
held
this
year
at
cambridge
i
invited
sir
david
brewster
and
mr
herschel
to
lodge
at
the
observatory
the
meeting
lasted
from
june
to
we
gave
one
dinner
but
had
a
breakfast
party
every
day
i
did
not
enter
much
into
the
scientific
business
of
the
meeting
except
that
i
brought
before
the
committee
the
expediency
of
reducing
the
greenwich
planetary
observations
from
they
agreed
to
represent
it
to
the
government
and
a
deputation
was
appointed
i
among
them
who
were
received
by
lord
althorp
on
july
on
herschel
announced
to
me
that
was
granted
on
i
started
with
my
wife
for
edensor
at
leicester
we
met
sedgwick
and
whewell
my
wife
went
on
to
edensor
and
i
joined
sedgwick
and
whewell
in
a
geological
expedition
to
mount
sorrel
and
various
parts
of
charnwood
forest
we
were
received
by
mr
allsop
of
woodlands
who
proved
an
estimable
acquaintance
this
lasted
four
or
five
days
and
we
then
went
on
to
on
herschel
wrote
to
me
communicating
an
offer
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
to
present
to
the
cambridge
observatory
an
of
about
inches
aperture
by
cauchaix
i
wrote
therefore
to
the
duke
accepting
generally
the
duke
wrote
to
me
from
buxton
on
his
letter
such
was
the
wretched
arrangement
of
postage
reaching
bakewell
and
edensor
on
the
and
on
the
i
drove
before
breakfast
to
buxton
and
had
an
interview
with
him
on
the
duke
wrote
authorizing
me
to
mount
the
telescope
entirely
and
he
subsequently
approved
of
cauchaix
terms
there
was
much
correspondence
but
on
i
instructed
cauchaix
how
to
send
the
on
our
return
we
paid
a
visit
to
dr
davy
master
of
caius
college
at
heacham
and
reached
cambridge
on
groombridge
catalogue
of
which
the
editing
was
formally
entrusted
to
mr
henry
taylor
son
of
taylor
the
of
the
greenwich
observatory
had
been
in
some
measure
referred
to
sheepshanks
and
he
in
investigating
the
work
found
reason
for
thinking
the
whole
discreditable
about
may
he
first
wrote
to
me
on
his
rising
quarrel
with
taylor
but
on
he
found
things
coming
to
a
crisis
and
denounced
the
whole
capt
beaufort
the
hydrographer
in
whose
office
this
matter
rested
begged
me
with
baily
to
decide
upon
it
we
did
not
at
first
quite
agree
upon
the
terms
of
investigation
but
after
a
time
all
was
settled
and
on
the
admiralty
formally
applied
and
i
formally
accepted
little
or
nothing
had
been
done
by
mr
baily
and
myself
when
my
work
was
interrupted
by
illness
sheepshanks
had
thought
that
something
might
be
done
to
advance
the
interests
of
myself
or
the
observatory
by
the
favour
of
lord
brougham
then
lord
chancellor
and
had
urged
me
to
write
an
article
in
the
penny
cyclopaedia
in
which
lord
brougham
took
great
interest
i
chose
the
subject
and
as
i
think
wrote
a
good
deal
of
it
in
this
autumn
when
it
was
interrupted
by
my
illness
on
having
at
first
intended
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
philosophical
society
and
then
having
changed
my
mind
i
was
engaged
in
the
evening
on
the
formulae
for
effects
of
small
errors
on
the
computation
of
the
solar
eclipse
of
a
dizziness
in
my
head
came
on
i
left
off
work
became
worse
and
went
to
bed
and
in
the
night
was
in
high
fever
with
a
fierce
attack
of
scarlet
fever
my
wife
was
also
attacked
but
very
slightly
the
first
day
of
quitting
my
bedroom
was
somewhere
about
the
time
of
my
illness
my
wife
sister
susanna
smith
who
was
much
reduced
in
the
summer
died
of
consumption
miscellaneous
notes
in
are
as
follows
henderson
at
the
cape
could
not
endure
it
much
longer
and
on
stratford
writes
that
maclear
had
just
sailed
to
take
his
place
henderson
is
candidate
for
the
edinburgh
stratford
writes
on
that
the
madras
observations
have
come
to
england
the
first
whose
arrangement
imitates
on
herschel
just
going
to
the
cape
entrusted
to
me
the
revisal
of
some
proof
sheets
if
necessary
however
it
was
never
in
november
i
sat
for
my
portrait
to
a
painter
named
purdon
i
think
he
came
to
the
house
and
made
a
good
likeness
a
pencil
portrait
was
taken
for
a
mason
in
cambridge
it
was
begun
before
my
illness
and
finished
after
i
applied
through
sheepshanks
for
a
copy
of
maskelyne
observations
to
be
used
in
the
reduction
of
the
planetary
observations
and
on
from
my
bedroom
i
applied
through
rigaud
to
the
delegates
of
the
clarendon
press
for
a
copy
of
bradley
observations
for
the
same
the
latter
request
was
refused
in
october
i
applied
to
the
syndics
of
the
university
press
for
printed
forms
for
these
reductions
the
syndics
agreed
to
grant
me
copies
on
i
went
with
my
wife
to
london
for
the
recruiting
of
my
strength
we
stayed
at
the
house
of
our
friend
miss
sheepshanks
and
returned
on
feb
i
drew
up
a
paper
of
questions
for
prizes
but
left
the
whole
trouble
of
examination
and
adjudication
to
professor
miller
who
at
my
request
acted
for
while
i
was
in
london
i
began
to
look
at
the
papers
relating
to
catalogue
and
i
believe
that
it
was
while
in
london
that
i
agreed
with
mr
baily
on
a
report
condemnatory
of
taylor
edition
and
sent
the
report
to
the
admiralty
the
admiralty
asked
for
further
advice
and
on
i
replied
undertaking
to
put
the
catalogue
in
order
on
mar
capt
beaufort
sent
me
all
the
papers
some
time
however
elapsed
before
i
could
proceed
with
it
there
was
in
this
spring
a
furious
discussion
about
the
admission
of
dissenters
into
the
university
i
took
the
liberal
side
on
apr
there
was
a
letter
of
mine
in
the
cambridge
on
apr
i
began
lectures
and
finished
on
may
there
were
my
was
either
finished
or
so
nearly
finished
that
on
i
had
some
conversation
with
knight
the
publisher
about
printing
it
it
was
printed
in
the
spring
and
on
apr
sheepshanks
sent
a
copy
of
it
to
lord
brougham
i
received
from
knight
for
this
on
may
i
went
to
london
i
believe
to
attend
one
of
the
soirées
which
the
duke
of
sussex
gave
as
president
of
the
royal
society
the
duke
invited
me
to
breakfast
privately
with
him
the
next
morning
he
then
spoke
to
me
on
the
part
of
the
government
about
my
taking
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
on
may
i
wrote
him
a
letter
to
which
reference
was
made
in
subsequent
correspondence
on
that
subject
on
may
my
son
arthur
was
in
june
the
observatory
syndicate
made
a
satisfied
on
june
i
went
to
the
greenwich
visitation
and
again
on
june
i
went
to
london
i
believe
for
the
purpose
of
trying
the
mounting
of
south
telescope
as
it
had
been
strengthened
by
mr
simms
by
suggestions
i
was
subsequently
in
correspondence
with
sheepshanks
on
the
subject
of
the
arbitration
on
south
telescope
and
my
giving
evidence
on
it
on
july
as
i
was
shortly
going
away
i
wrote
him
a
report
on
the
telescope
to
be
used
in
case
of
my
absence
the
award
which
was
given
in
december
was
entirely
in
favour
of
on
july
i
went
out
i
think
to
my
brother
marriage
at
ixworth
in
on
i
started
for
edensor
and
cumberland
with
my
wife
sister
and
three
children
georgiana
smith
joined
us
at
edensor
we
went
by
otley
harrogate
ripon
and
stanmoor
to
keswick
from
whence
we
made
many
excursions
on
i
went
with
whewell
to
the
clouds
on
skiddaw
to
try
hygrometers
mr

to
me
to
enquire
whether
i
would
accept
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
if
it
were
vacant
i
replied
from
keswick
on
expressing
my
general
willingness
stipulating
for
my
freedom
of
vote
and
referring
to
my
letter
to
the
duke
of
sussex
on
lord

wrote
and
on
i
provisionally
accepted

on
i
wrote
to
ask
for
leave
to
give
a
course
of
lectures
at
cambridge
in
case
that
my
successor
at
cambridge
should
find
difficulty
in
doing
it
in
the
first
year
and
to
this
lord
auckland
assented
on
all
this
arrangement
was
for
a
time
upset
by
the
change
of
ministry
which
shortly
followed
amongst
miscellaneous
matters
in
march
i
had
some
correspondence
with
the
duke
of
northumberland
about
the
cauchaix
telescope
in
august
i
had
to
announce
to
him
that
the
had
been
a
little
shattered
in
cauchaix
shop
and
required
regrinding
finally
on
i
announced
its
arrival
at
in
the
planetary
reductions
i
find
that
i
employed
one
computer
glaisher
for
in
november
the
lalande
medal
was
awarded
to
me
by
the
french
institut
and
mr
pentland
conveyed
it
to
me
in
on
march
i
gave
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
a
paper
of
researches
into
the
value
of
jupiter
mass
on
apr
the
latitude
of
cambridge
observatory
on
june
the
position
of
the
ecliptic
and
the
solar
eclipse
of
to
the
royal
astronomical
society
on
computing
the
diffraction
of
an
object

to
the
cambridge
society
and
on
the
calculation
of
perturbations
to
the
nautical
almanac
this
paper
was
written
at
keswick
between
and
i
also
furnished
mr
sheepshanks
with
investigations
regarding
the
form
of
the
pivots
of
the
cape
circle
on
i
was
elected
correspondent
of
the
french
academy
and
on
mr
pentland
sent
me
the
balance
of
the
proceeds
of
the
lalande
medal
i
prepared
my
paper
for
prizes
and
joined
in
the
examination
as
usual
there
had
been
a
very
sudden
change
of
administration
and
sir
peel
was
now
prime
minister
as
first
lord
of
the
treasury
and
lord
lyndhurst
was
lord
chancellor
on
i
wrote
to
lord
lyndhurst
asking
him
for
a
suffolk
living
for
my
brother
william
which
he
declined
to
give
though
he
remembered
my
application
some
years
later
whether
my
application
led
to
the
favour
which
i
shortly
received
from
the
government
i
do
not
know
but
in
dining
with
the
duke
of
sussex
in
the
last
year
i
had
been
introduced
to
sir
peel
and
he
had
conversed
with
me
a
long
time
and
appeared
to
have
heard
favourably
of
me
on
he
wrote
to
me
an
autograph
letter
offering
a
pension
of
per
annum
with
no
terms
of
any
kind
and
allowing
it
to
be
settled
if
i
should
think
fit
on
my
wife
i
wrote
on
accepting
it
for
my
wife
in
a
few
days
the
matter
went
through
the
formal
steps
and
mr
whewell
and
mr
sheepshanks
were
nominated
trustees
for
my
wife
the
subject
came
before
parliament
by
the
whig
party
vindicating
their
own
propriety
in
having
offered
me
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
in
the
preceding
year
and
spring
rice
letter
then
written
to
me
was
published
in
the
times
the
correspondence
relating
to
the
pension
is
given
below
and
appears
to
be
of
interest
both
as
conveying
in
very
felicitous
terms
the
opinion
of
a
very
eminent
statesman
on
the
general
subject
of
such
pensions
and
as
a
most
convincing
proof
of
the
lofty
position
in
science
which
the
subject
of
this
memoir
had
then
attained
whitehall
gardens
sir
you
probably
are
aware
that
in
a
resolution
voted
by
the
house
of
commons
in
the
last
session
of
parliament
an
opinion
was
expressed
that
pensions
on
the
civil
list
ought
not
thereafter
to
be
granted
by
the
crown
excepting
for
the
satisfaction
of
certain
public
claims
among
which
those
resting
on
scientific
or
literary
eminence
were
especially
mentioned
i
trust
that
no
such
resolution
would
have
been
necessary
to
induce
me
as
minister
of
the
crown
fully
to
recognize
the
justice
of
such
claims
but
i
refer
to
the
resolution
as
removing
every
impediment
to
a
communication
of
the
nature
of
that
which
i
am
about
to
make
to
you
in
acting
upon
the
principle
of
the
resolution
in
so
far
as
the
claims
of
science
are
concerned
my
address
is
made
to
you
and
made
directly
and
without
previous
communication
with
any
other
person
because
it
is
dictated
exclusively
by
public
considerations
and
because
there
can
be
no
advantage
in
or
any
motive
for
indirect
communication
i
consider
you
to
have
the
first
claim
on
the
royal
favour
which
eminence
in
those
high
pursuits
to
which
your
life
is
devoted
can
give
and
i
fear
that
the
emoluments
attached
to
your
appointment
in
the
university
of
cambridge
are
hardly
sufficient
to
relieve
you
from
anxiety
as
to
the
future
on
account
of
those
in
whose
welfare
you
are
deeply
interested
the
state
of
the
civil
list
would
enable
me
to
advise
the
king
to
grant
a
pension
of
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
and
if
the
offer
be
acceptable
to
you
the
pension
shall
be
granted
either
to
mrs
airy
or
yourself
as
you
may
prefer
i
beg
you
distinctly
to
understand
that
your
acquiescence
in
this
proposal
will
impose
upon
you
no
obligation
personal
or
political
in
the
slightest
degree
i
make
it
solely
upon
public
grounds
and
i
ask
you
by
the
acceptance
of
it
to
permit
the
king
to
give
some
slight
encouragement
to
science
by
proving
to
those
who
may
be
disposed
to
follow
your
bright
example
that
devotion
to
the
highest
branches
of
mathematical
and
astronomical
knowledge
shall
not
necessarily
involve
them
in
constant
solicitude
as
to
the
future
condition
of
those
for
whom
the
application
of
the
same
talents
to
more
lucrative
pursuits
would
have
ensured
an
ample
provision
i
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
with
true
respect
and
esteem
your
faithful
servant
robert
peel
professor
airy
observatory
cambridge
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
acknowledge
your
letter
of
the
acquainting
me
with
your
intention
of
advising
the
king
to
grant
a
pension
of
per
annum
from
the
civil
list
to
me
or
mrs
airy
i
trust
you
will
believe
that
i
am
sensible
of
the
flattering
terms
in
which
this
offer
is
made
and
deeply
grateful
for
the
considerate
manner
in
which
the
principal
arrangement
is
left
to
my
choice
as
well
as
for
the
freedom
from
engagement
in
which
your
offer
leaves
me
i
beg
to
state
that
i
most
willingly
accept
the
offer
i
should
prefer
that
the
pension
be
settled
on
mrs
airy
by
which
i
understand
that
in
case
of
her
surviving
me
the
pension
would
be
continued
to
her
during
her
life
or
in
the
contrary
event
would
cease
with
her
life
i
wish
that
i
may
have
the
good
fortune
to
prove
to
the
world
that
i
do
not
accept
this
offer
without
an
implied
engagement
on
my
part
i
beg
leave
again
to
thank
you
for
your
attention
and
to
assure
you
that
the
form
in
which
it
is
conveyed
makes
it
doubly
acceptable
with
sincere
respect
i
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
your
very
faithful
servant
airy
right
hon
sir
robert

whitehall
sir
i
will
give
immediate
directions
for
the
preparation
of
the
warrant
settling
the
pension
on
mrs
airy
the
effect
of
which
will
be
as
you
suppose
to
grant
the
pension
to
her
for
her
life
i
assure
you
i
never
gave
an
official
order
which
was
accompanied
with
more
satisfaction
to
myself
than
this
i
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
your
faithful
servant
robert
peel
professor
airy
on
march
i
started
meeting
sheepshanks
at
kingstown
for
ireland
we
visited
dublin
observatory
and
then
went
direct
to
markree
near
sligo
to
see
mr
cooper
telescope
our
principal
object
we
passed
on
our
return
by
enniskillen
and
ballyjamesduff
where
my
former
pupil
morton
was
living
and
returned
on
apr
on
apr
i
was
elected
to
the
royal
society
apr
my
wife
wrote
me
from
edensor
that
her
sister
florence
was
very
ill
she
died
shortly
on
may
i
began
lectures
and
finished
on
may
there
were
my
former
pupil
guest
asks
my
interest
for
the
recordership
of
in
june
was
circulated
the
syndicate
report
on
the
the
date
of
the
preface
to
the
observations
is
june
the
ministry
had
been
again
changed
in
the
spring
and
the
whigs
were
again
in
power
on
june
lord
auckland
who
was
again
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
as
last
year
again
wrote
to
me
to
offer
me
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
or
to
request
my
suggestions
on
the
filling
up
of
the
office
on
june
i
wrote
my
first
reply
and
on
june
wrote
to
accept
it
on
june
lord
auckland
acknowledges
and
on
june
the
king
approved
lord
auckland
appointed
to
see
me
on
friday
june
but
i
was
unwell
i
had
various
correspondence
with
lord
auckland
principally
about
buildings
and
had
an
appointment
with
him
for
august
as
lord
auckland
was
just
quitting
office
to
go
to
india
i
was
introduced
to
mr
charles
wood
the
secretary
of
the
admiralty
with
whom
principally
the
subsequent
business
was
transacted
at
this
meeting
lord
auckland
and
mr
wood
expressed
their
feeling
that
the
observatory
had
fallen
into
such
a
state
of
disrepute
that
the
whole
establishment
ought
to
be
cleared
out
i
represented
that
i
could
make
it
efficient
with
a
good
first
assistant
and
the
other
assistants
were
kept
but
the
establishment
was
in
a
queer
state
the
royal
warrant
under
the
sign
manual
was
sent
on
august
it
was
understood
that
my
occupation
of
office
would
commence
on
october
but
repairs
and
alterations
of
buildings
would
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
reside
at
greenwich
before
the
end
of
the
year
on
i
went
to
the
observatory
and
entered
formally
upon
the
office
though
not
residing
for
some
time
oct
is
the
date
of
my
official
instructions
i
had
made
it
a
condition
of
accepting
the
office
that
the
then
first
assistant
should
be
removed
and
accordingly
i
had
the
charge
of
seeking
another
i
determined
to
have
a
man
who
had
taken
a
respectable
cambridge
degree
i
made
enquiry
first
of
mr
bowstead
brother
to
the
bishop
and
mr
steventon
at
length
consulting
mr
hopkins
a
private
tutor
at
cambridge
he
recommended
to
me
mr
robert
main
of
queens
college
with
whom
i
corresponded
in
the
month
principally
of
august
and
whom
on
august
i
nominated
to
the
admiralty
on
simms
one
of
the
assistants
who
apparently
had
hoped
for
the
office
of
first
assistant
for
which
he
was
quite
incompetent
resigned
and
on
i
appointed
in
his
place
mr
james
glaisher
who
had
been
at
cambridge
from
the
beginning
of
and
on
the
admiralty
approved
during
this
quarter
of
a
year
i
was
residing
at
cambridge
observatory
visiting
greenwich
once
a
week
at
least
for
some
time
the
immediate
superintendence
of
the
observatory
being
placed
with
mr
main
i
was
however
engaged
in
reforming
the
system
of
the
greenwich
observatory
and
prepared
and
printed
skeleton
forms
for
reductions
of
observations
and
other
business
on
i
resigned
my
professorship
to
the
but
i
continued
the
reduction
of
the
observations
so
that
not
a
single
figure
was
left
to
my
successor
the
last
observations
were
those
of
halley
comet
the
preface
to
my
cambridge
observations
is
dated
in
regard
to
the
northumberland
telescope
i
had
for
some
time
been
speculating
on
plans
of
mounting
and
enclosing
the
instrument
and
had
corresponded
with
simms
biddell
cubitt
and
others
on
the
subject
on
apr
tulley
the
younger
was
endeavouring
to
adjust
the
on
may
i
plainly
asked
the
duke
of
northumberland
whether
he
would
defray
the
expense
of
the
mounting
and
building
on
june
he
assented
and
money
was
placed
at
a
to
my
order
i
then
proceeded
in
earnest
in
the
autumn
the
building
was
erected
and
the
dome
was
covered
before
the
depth
of
winter
i
continued
in
to
superintend
the
mounting
of
the
instrument
in
regard
to
the
planetary
reductions
to
july
glaisher
had
been
employed
weeks
and
from
july
to
weeks
mr
spring
rice
when
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
had
promised
money
but
no
official
minute
had
been
made
and
no
money
had
been
granted
on
i
applied
to
mr
baring
secretary
of
the
treasury
after
another
letter
he
answered
on
that
he
found
no
official
minute
after
writing
to
vernon
harcourt
and
to
spring
rice
the
matter
was
arranged
my
outlay
was
refunded
and
another
sum
in
regard
to
groombridge
observations
i
find
that
on
certain
trial
reductions
had
been
made
under
my
direction
by
j
i
had
attempted
some
optical
experiments
in
the
summer
especially
on
the
polarization
of
but
had
been
too
busy
with
the
observatory
to
continue
them
in
august
my
wife
was
in
a
critical
state
of
in
december
i
received
information
regarding
merchant
ships
chronometers
for
which
i
had
applied
to
mr
charles
parker
of
on
mr
spring
rice
and
lord
john
russell
offered
me
knighthood
but
i
declined
on
july
i
went
into
suffolk
with
my
wife
sisters
elizabeth
and
georgiana
and
returned
on
august
this
was
all
the
holiday
that
i
got
in
this
on
the
of
august
i
saw
mr
taylor
the
admiralty
civil
architect
in
london
and
the
extension
of
buildings
at
greenwich
observatory
was
i
made
various
journeys
to
greenwich
and
on
having
sent
off
our
furniture
we
all
quitted
the
cambridge
observatory
and
stayed
for
some
days
at
the
house
of
miss
sheepshanks
thus
ended
a
busy
and
anxious
year
with
reference
to
the
offer
of
knighthood
reply
is
characteristic
and
the
short
correspondence
relating
to
it
is
therefore
the
offer
itself
is
an
additional
proof
of
the
high
estimation
in
which
he
stood
at
this
time
downing
street
my
dear
sir
i
have
been
in
communication
with
my
colleague
lord
john
russell
which
has
made
me
feel
rather
anxious
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
but
on
second
thoughts
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
the
subject
of
my
communication
would
render
it
more
satisfactory
to
you
to
receive
a
letter
than
to
pay
a
visit
in
testimony
of
the
respect
which
is
felt
for
your
character
and
acquirements
there
would
be
every
disposition
to
recommend
you
to
his
majesty
to
receive
the
distinction
of
knighthood
i
am
quite
aware
that
to
you
individually
this
may
be
a
matter
of
small
concern
but
to
the
scientific
world
in
general
it
will
not
be
indifferent
and
to
foreign
countries
it
will
mark
the
consideration
felt
for
you
personally
as
well
as
for
the
position
which
you
occupy
among
your
learned
contemporaries
from
a
knowledge
of
the
respect
and
esteem
which
i
feel
for
you
lord
john
russell
has
wished
that
the
communication
should
be
made
through
me
rather
than
through
any
person
who
had
not
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
pray
let
me
hear
from
you
and
believe
me
my
dear
sir
with
compliments
to
mrs
airy
very
truly
yours
spring
rice
it
may
be
right
to
add
that
when
a
title
of
honor
is
conferred
on
grounds
like
those
which
apply
to
your
case
no
fees
or
charges
of
any
kind
would
be
payable
observatory
cambridge
my
dear
sir
i
beg
to
acknowledge
your
letter
of
the
which
i
have
received
at
this
place
conveying
to
me
an
intimation
of
the
wish
of
his
ministers
to
recommend
me
to
the
king
for
the
honor
of
knighthood
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
i
am
most
sensible
to
the
liberality
which
i
have
experienced
from
the
government
in
other
as
well
as
in
pecuniary
matters
and
that
i
am
very
highly
gratified
by
the
consideration
undeserved
by
me
i
fear
which
they
have
displayed
in
the
present
instance
and
if
i
now
request
permission
to
decline
the
honor
offered
to
me
i
trust
i
may
make
it
fully
understood
that
it
is
not
because
i
value
it
lightly
or
because
i
am
not
anxious
to
receive
honors
from
such
a
source
the
unalterable
custom
of
this
country
has
attached
a
certain
degree
of
light
consideration
to
titles
of
honor
which
are
not
supported
by
considerable
fortune
or
at
least
it
calls
for
the
display
of
such
an
establishment
as
may
not
be
conveniently
supported
by
even
a
comfortable
income
the
provision
attached
to
my
official
situation
and
the
liberality
of
the
king
towards
one
of
the
members
of
my
family
have
placed
me
in
a
position
of
great
comfort
these
circumstances
however
have
bound
me
to
consider
myself
as
the
devoted
servant
of
the
country
and
to
debar
myself
from
efforts
to
increase
my
fortune
which
might
otherwise
have
been
open
to
me
i
do
not
look
forward
therefore
to
any
material
increase
of
income
and
that
which
i
enjoy
at
present
is
hardly
sufficient
in
my
opinion
to
support
respectably
the
honor
which
you
and
lord
john
russell
have
proposed
to
confer
upon
me
for
this
reason
only
i
beg
leave
most
respectfully
to
decline
the
honor
of
knighthood
at
the
present
time
i
have
only
to
add
that
my
services
will
always
be
at
the
command
of
the
government
in
any
scientific
subject
in
which
i
can
be
of
the
smallest
use
i
am
my
dear
sir
your
very
faithful
servant
airy
right
honorable
spring
in
brief
revision
of
the
years
from
to
i
may
confine
myself
to
the
two
principal
subjects
my
professorial
lectures
and
my
conduct
of
the
cambridge
observatory
the
lectures
as
begun
in
included
ordinary
mechanics
ordinary
hydrostatics
and
pneumatics
i
think
that
i
did
not
touch
or
touched
very
lightly
on
the
subjects
connected
with
the
hydraulic
ram
and
ordinary
optics
with
a
very
few
words
on
polarization
and
depolarization
in
the
two
first
were
generally
improved
and
for
the
third
optics
i
introduced
a
few
words
on
circular
polarization
i
believe
that
it
was
in
that
i
made
an
addition
to
the
syllabus
with
a
small
engraving
shewing
the
interference
of
light
in
the
best
practical
experiment
that
of
the
flat
prism
and
i
went
thoroughly
into
the
main
points
of
the
undulatory
theory
interference
diffraction
in
i
believe
i
went
in
addition
to
what
is
mentioned
above
into
polarization
and
depolarization
of
all
kinds
my
best
lecture
diagrams
were
drawn
and
painted
by
my
wife
the
lectures
were
universally
pronounced
to
be
valuable
the
subjects
underwent
no
material
change
in
and
i
believe
it
was
a
matter
of
sincere
regret
to
many
persons
that
my
removal
to
greenwich
terminated
the
series
each
lecture
nominally
occupied
an
hour
but
i
always
encouraged
students
to
stop
and
talk
with
me
and
this
supplement
was
usually
considered
a
valuable
part
of
the
lecture
practically
the
lecture
on
most
days
occupied
two
hours
i
enjoyed
the
lectures
much
yet
i
felt
that
the
labour
in
addition
to
other
work
made
an
impression
on
my
strength
and
i
became
at
length
desirous
of
terminating
them
the
observatory
when
i
took
charge
of
it
had
only
one
instrument
the
the
principles
however
which
i
laid
down
for
my
own
direction
were
adapted
to
the
expected
complete
equipment
planets
totally
neglected
at
greenwich
were
to
be
observed
observations
were
to
be
reduced
completely
and
the
reductions
were
to
be
exhibited
in
an
orderly
way
this
was
a
novelty
in
astronomy
i
considered
it
so
important
that
i
actually
proposed
to
omit
in
my
publication
the
original
observations
but
was
dissuaded
by
herschel
and
others
i
sometimes
suspended
observations
for
a
short
time
in
order
to
obtain
leisure
for
the
reductions
i
had
at
first
no
intention
of
correcting
the
places
of
the
fundamental
stars
as
settled
at
greenwich
but
i
found
myself
compelled
to
do
so
because
they
were
not
sufficiently
accurate
and
then
i
took
the
course
of
observing
and
reducing
as
an
independent
observer
without
reference
to
any
other
observatory
i
introduced
the
principle
of
not
correcting
instrumental
errors
but
measuring
them
and
applying
numerical
corrections
i
determined
my
longitude
by
chronometers
and
my
latitude
by
a
repeating
circle
borrowed
from
mr
sheepshanks
which
i
used
so
well
that
the
result
was
only
half
a
second
in
error
the
form
of
my
reductions
in
the
published
volume
for
is
rather
irregular
but
the
matter
is
good
it
soon
attracted
attention
in
the
process
was
much
the
same
i
had
an
assistant
mr
baldrey
in
still
the
same
with
the
additions
that
i
formally
gave
the
corrections
of
relative
of
fundamental
stars
without
alteration
of
equinox
which
i
had
not
the
means
of
obtaining
to
be
used
in
the
year
and
that
i
reduced
completely
the
observed
occultations
with
a
small
error
subsequently
corrected
in
the
system
of
correction
of
broken
transits
was
improved
the
errors
of
assumed
of
fundamental
stars
were
exhibited
mean
solar
time
was
obtained
from
sidereal
time
by
time
of
transit
of
symbol
aries
computed
by
myself
the
method
of
computing
occultations
was
improved
in
the
small
equatoreal
was
erected
and
was
soon
employed
in
observations
of
the
elongation
of
the
satellite
of
jupiter
for
determining
the
mass
of
jupiter
the
mural
circle
was
erected
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
not
used
the
calculation
of
of
fundamental
stars
was
made
homogeneously
with
the
others
separate
results
of
all
were
included
in
ledgers
a
was
formed
all
as
to
the
present
time
with
the
equatoreal
the
difference
of
of
mars
and
stars
was
observed
with
the
beginning
of
the
mural
circle
was
established
at
work
a
second
assistant
mr
glaisher
was
appointed
and
the
observatory
might
be
considered
complete
i
made
experiments
on
the
graduations
of
the
circle
i
detected
and
was
annoyed
by
the
r
i
determined
the
latitude
i
exhibited
the
separate
results
for
of
stars
in
ledger
and
their
means
in
catalogue
i
investigated
from
my
observations
the
place
of
equinox
and
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
i
made
another
series
of
observations
of
jupiter
satellite
for
the
mass
of
jupiter
i
observed
the
solar
eclipse
with
the
equatoreal
by
a
method
then
first
introduced
which
i
have
since
used
several
times
at
cambridge
and
greenwich
with
excellent
effect
the
moon
and
the
planets
were
usually
observed
till
near
two
in
the
morning
correction
for
defective
illumination
applied
when
necessary
the
volume
is
very
complete
the
only
deficiency
being
in
the
observation
of
moon
and
planets
through
the
severe
morning
hours
in
the
only
novelties
are
examination
of
the
graduations
of
the
declination
circle
of
the
equatoreal
excessively
bad
observations
of
a
spot
on
jupiter
for
rotation
and
of
mars
and
stars
in
including
january
there
is
a
more
complete
examination
of
the
equatoreal
graduations
parallax
and
refraction
for
equatoreal
observations
a
spot
on
jupiter
a
series
of
observations
on
jupiter
satellite
for
the
mass
of
jupiter
mars
and
stars
halley
comet
the
best
series
of
observations
which
could
be
made
in
the
season
and
a
short
series
of
meteorological
observations
on
a
plan
suggested
by
sir
john
herschel
then
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
can
not
tell
precisely
in
which
year
i
introduced
the
following
useful
custom
towards
the
end
of
each
year
i
procured
a
for
the
following
year
with
a
space
for
every
day
and
carefully
examining
all
the
sources
of
elements
of
observations
and
determining
the
observations
to
be
made
every
day
i
inserted
them
in
the
this
system
gave
wonderful
steadiness
to
the
plan
of
observations
for
the
next
year
the
system
has
been
maintained
in
great
perfection
at
the
observatory
of
greenwich
the
first
of
these
which
adams
has
found
is
that
for
printed
skeleton
forms
were
introduced
for
all
calculations
from
in
the
greenwich
observatory
library
there
is
a
collection
i
believe
complete
of
printed
papers
commencing
with
my
manifesto
and
containing
all
syndicate
reports
except
for
when
perhaps
there
was
none
it
seems
from
these
that
my
first
written
report
on
observations
was
on
may
the
first
syndicate
report
is
on
may
a
few
remarks
on
airy
private
life
and
friends
during
his
residence
at
cambridge
observatory
may
be
here
appropriately
inserted
amid
the
laborious
occupations
recorded
in
the
foregoing
pages
his
social
life
and
surroundings
appear
to
have
been
most
pleasant
and
congenial
at
that
period
there
were
in
residence
in
cambridge
and
particularly
at
trinity
a
large
number
of
very
brilliant
men
airy
was
essentially
a
cambridge
man
he
had
come
up
poor
and
friendless
he
had
gained
friends
and
fame
at
the
university
and
his
whole
work
had
been
done
there
from
the
frequent
references
in
after
times
both
by
him
and
his
wife
to
their
life
at
cambridge
it
is
clear
that
they
had
a
very
pleasant
recollection
of
it
and
that
the
social
gatherings
there
were
remarkably
attractive
he
has
himself
recorded
that
with
whewell
and
sedgwick
and
his
accomplished
who
were
frequently
on
long
visits
at
the
observatory
they
formed
pretty
nearly
one
family
his
friendship
with
whewell
was
very
close
although
whewell
was
at
times
hasty
and
and
even
extremely
rude
yet
he
was
generous
and
and
thoroughly
upright
footnote
the
following
passage
occurs
in
a
letter
from
airy
to
his
wife
dated
i
am
sorry
that
speaks
in
such
terms
of
the
master
as
she
used
to
be
so
proud
of
him
it
is
only
those
who
have
gone
through
the
ordeal
of
quarrels
with
him
and
almost
insults
from
him
like
sheepshanks
and
me
that
thoroughly
appreciate
the
good
that
is
in
him
i
am
sure
he
will
never
want
a
good
word
from
me
in
power
of
mind
in
pursuits
and
interests
airy
had
more
in
common
with
whewell
than
with
any
other
of
his
friends
it
was
with
whewell
that
he
undertook
the
experiments
at
dolcoath
it
was
to
whewell
that
he
first
communicated
the
result
of
his
remarkable
investigation
of
the
long
inequality
of
venus
and
the
earth
and
some
of
his
optical
researches
were
conducted
jointly
with
whewell
whewell
took
his
degree
in
seven
years
before
airy
and
his
reputation
both
for
mathematical
and
knowledge
was
extremely
and
deservedly
great
but
he
was
always
most
generous
in
his
recognition
of
airy
powers
thus
in
a
letter
of
mar
life
of
william
whewell
by
mrs
stair
douglas
he
says
airy
is
certainly
a
most
extraordinary
man
and
deserves
everything
that
can
be
said
of
him
and
again
in
the
autumn
of
he
writes
to
his
aunt
you
mentioned
a
difficulty
which
had
occurred
to
you
in
one
of
your
late
letters
how
airy
should
be
made
professor
while
i
was
here
who
being
your
nephew
must
of
course
on
that
account
deserve
it
better
than
he
could
now
it
is
a
thing
which
you
will
think
odd
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
airy
is
a
better
mathematician
than
your
nephew
and
has
moreover
been
much
more
employed
of
late
in
such
studies
seriously
speaking
airy
is
by
very
much
the
best
person
they
could
have
chosen
for
the
situation
and
few
things
have
given
me
so
much
pleasure
as
his
election
how
much
whewell
depended
upon
his
friends
at
the
observatory
may
be
gathered
from
a
letter
which
he
wrote
to
his
sister
on
we
have
lately
been
in
alarm
here
on
the
subject
of
illness
two
very
near
friends
of
mine
and
mrs
airy
have
had
the
scarlet
fever
at
the
same
time
she
more
slightly
he
very
severely
they
are
now
i
am
thankful
to
say
doing
well
and
recovering
rapidly
you
will
recollect
that
i
was
staying
with
them
at
her
father
in
derbyshire
in
the
summer
they
are
i
think
two
of
the
most
admirable
and
delightful
persons
that
the
world
contains
and
again
on
he
wrote
to
his
sister
ann
my
friends
i
may
almost
say
my
dearest
friends
professor
airy
and
his
family
have
left
cambridge
he
being
appointed
astronomer
royal
at
greenwich
to
me
an
irreparable
loss
but
i
shall
probably
go
and
see
how
they
look
in
their
new
abode
their
close
intercourse
was
naturally
interrupted
by
airy
removal
to
greenwich
but
their
friendly
feelings
and
mutual
respect
continued
without
material
break
till
whewell
death
there
was
frequent
correspondence
between
them
especially
on
matters
connected
with
the
conduct
and
teaching
of
the
university
in
which
they
both
took
a
keen
interest
and
a
warm
welcome
at
trinity
lodge
always
awaited
mr
and
mrs
airy
when
they
visited
cambridge
in
a
letter
written
to
mrs
stair
douglas
on
enclosing
some
of
whewell
letters
there
occurs
the
following
passage
after
the
decease
of
mrs
whewell
whewell
wrote
to
my
wife
a
mournful
letter
telling
her
of
his
melancholy
state
and
asking
her
to
visit
him
at
the
lodge
for
a
few
days
and
she
did
go
and
did
the
honours
of
the
house
for
several
days
you
will
gather
from
this
the
relation
in
which
the
families
stood
whewell
died
on
mar
from
the
effects
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
the
following
extract
is
from
a
letter
written
by
airy
to
whewell
niece
mrs
sumner
gibson
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
his
old
friend
the
master
was
i
believe
my
oldest
surviving
friend
beyond
my
own
family
and
after
an
acquaintance
of
years
i
must
have
been
one
of
his
oldest
friends
we
have
during
that
time
been
connected
privately
and
officially
we
travelled
together
and
experimented
together
and
as
opportunity
served
but
i
need
not
say
in
very
different
degrees
we
both
laboured
for
our
college
and
university
a
terrible
blank
is
left
on
my
mind
sedgwick
was
probably
years
older
than
airy
he
took
his
degree
in
but
the
astonishing
buoyancy
of
spirits
and
bonhomie
of
sedgwick
fitted
him
for
all
ages
alike
he
was
undoubtedly
the
most
popular
man
in
cambridge
in
modern
times
his
ability
his
brightness
and
wit
his
fearless
honesty
and
uprightness
his
and
good
humour
rendered
him
a
universal
favourite
his
close
alliance
with
airy
was
much
more
social
than
scientific
it
is
true
that
they
made
some
geological
excursions
together
but
at
any
rate
with
airy
it
was
far
more
by
way
of
recreation
than
of
serious
study
and
science
was
entirely
geological
their
friendship
continued
till
sedgwick
death
though
it
was
once
or
twice
imperilled
by
impulsive
and
hasty
nature
peacock
took
his
degree
in
herschel
year
and
was
therefore
probably
years
older
than
airy
he
was
the
earliest
and
staunchest
friend
of
airy
in
his
undergraduate
years
encouraged
him
in
every
possible
way
lent
him
books
assisted
him
in
his
studies
helped
him
with
wise
advice
on
many
occasions
and
took
the
greatest
interest
in
his
success
he
was
a
good
and
advanced
mathematician
and
with
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
and
he
united
a
singular
kindness
and
gentleness
of
manner
it
is
therefore
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
was
regarded
by
airy
with
the
greatest
esteem
and
affection
and
though
they
were
afterwards
separated
by
peacock
becoming
dean
of
ely
and
airy
astronomer
royal
yet
their
warm
friendship
was
never
broken
the
following
letter
written
by
airy
to
mrs
peacock
on
receiving
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
dean
well
expresses
his
feelings
towards
his
old
friend
trinity
lodge
cambridge
my
dear
madam
i
have
desired
for
some
time
to
express
to
you
my
sympathies
on
occasion
of
the
sad
bereavement
which
has
come
upon
me
perhaps
as
strongly
as
upon
any
one
not
connected
by
family
ties
with
my
late
friend
but
i
can
scarcely
give
you
an
idea
how
every
disposable
moment
of
my
time
has
been
occupied
i
am
now
called
to
cambridge
on
business
and
i
seize
the
first
free
time
to
write
to
you
my
late
friend
was
the
first
person
whom
i
knew
in
college
i
had
an
introduction
to
him
when
i
went
up
as
freshman
from
the
first
he
desired
me
to
consider
the
introduction
not
as
entitling
me
to
a
mere
formal
recognition
from
him
but
as
authorizing
me
at
all
times
to
call
on
him
for
any
assistance
which
i
might
require
and
this
was
fully
carried
out
i
referred
to
him
in
every
difficulty
i
had
the
entire
command
of
his
rooms
and
library
a
very
important
aid
in
following
the
new
course
of
mathematics
which
he
had
been
so
instrumental
in
introducing
into
the
university
in
his
occasional
absences
and
in
all
respects
i
looked
to
him
as
to
a
parent
all
my
debts
to
other
friends
in
the
university
added
together
are
not
comparable
to
what
i
owe
to
the
late
dean
latterly
i
need
not
say
that
i
owed
much
to
him
and
that
i
owe
much
to
you
for
your
kind
notice
of
my
two
sons
even
since
the
sad
event
which
has
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
do
more
in
the
past
summer
looking
to
my
custom
of
making
a
visit
to
cambridge
in
some
part
of
the
october
term
i
had
determined
that
a
visit
to
ely
this
year
should
not
depend
on
the
chance
of
being
free
to
leave
cambridge
but
that
if
it
should
be
found
convenient
to
yourself
and
the
dean
the
first
journey
should
be
made
to
ely
i
wish
that
i
had
formed
the
same
resolution
one
or
two
years
ago
with
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
and
with
deep
sympathy
on
this
occasion
i
am
my
dear
madam
yours
very
faithfully
airy
sheepshanks
was
a
fellow
of
trinity
in
orders
he
was
probably
seven
years
older
than
airy
he
took
his
degree
in
he
was
not
one
of
airy
earliest
friends
but
he
had
a
great
taste
and
liking
for
astronomy
and
the
friendship
between
them
when
once
established
became
very
close
he
was
a
very
staunch
and
fearless
friend
an
able
and
incisive
writer
and
remarkably
energetic
and
diligent
in
astronomical
investigations
he
or
his
sister
miss
sheepshanks
had
a
house
in
london
and
sheepshanks
was
very
much
in
london
and
busied
himself
extremely
with
the
work
of
the
royal
observatory
that
of
the
board
of
longitude
and
miscellaneous
astronomical
matters
he
was
most
hospitable
to
his
friends
and
while
airy
resided
at
cambridge
his
house
was
always
open
to
receive
him
on
his
frequent
visits
to
town
in
the
various
polemical
discussions
on
scientific
matters
in
which
airy
was
engaged
sheepshanks
was
an
invaluable
ally
and
after
airy
removal
to
greenwich
had
more
or
less
separated
him
from
his
cambridge
friends
sheepshanks
was
still
associated
with
him
and
took
a
keen
interest
in
his
greenwich
work
and
this
continued
till
sheepshanks
death
the
warmest
friendship
always
subsisted
between
the
family
at
the
observatory
and
mr
and
miss
sheepshanks
there
were
many
other
friends
able
and
talented
men
but
these
four
were
the
chief
and
it
is
curious
to
note
that
they
were
all
much
older
than
airy
it
would
seem
as
if
airy
knowledge
had
matured
in
so
remarkable
a
manner
and
the
original
work
that
he
produced
was
so
brilliant
and
copious
that
by
common
consent
he
ranked
with
men
who
were
much
his
seniors
and
the
natural
gravity
and
decorum
of
his
manners
when
quite
a
young
man
well
supported
the
idea
of
an
age
considerably
greater
than
was
actually
the
case
chapter
at
greenwich
observatory
to
through
the
last
quarter
of
i
had
kept
everything
going
on
at
the
greenwich
observatory
in
the
same
manner
in
which
mr
pond
had
carried
it
on
with
the
beginning
of
my
new
system
began
i
had
already
prepared
printed
skeleton
forms
a
system
totally
unknown
to
mr
pond
which
were
now
brought
into
use
and
having
seen
the
utility
of
the
copying
press
in
merchants
offices
i
procured
one
from
this
time
my
correspondence
public
and
private
is
exceedingly
perfect
at
this
time
the
dwelling
house
was
still
unconnected
with
the
observatory
it
had
no
staircase
to
the
octagon
room
four
new
rooms
had
been
built
for
me
on
the
western
side
of
the
dwelling
house
but
they
were
not
yet
habitable
the
dome
ground
floor
was
still
a
passage
room
the
north
terrace
was
the
official
passage
to
the
dome
where
there
was
a
miserable
equatoreal
and
to
the
zenith
tube
in
a
square
tower
like
a
steeple
which
connected
the
dome
with
flamsteed
house
the
southern
boundary
of
the
garden
ran
down
a
hollow
which
divides
the
peninsula
from
the
site
of
the
present
magnetic
observatory
in
such
a
manner
that
the
principal
part
of
the
garden
was
fully
exposed
to
the
public
the
computing
room
was
a
most
pitiful
little
room
there
was
so
little
room
for
me
that
i
transported
the
principal
table
to
a
room
in
my
house
where
i
conducted
much
of
my
own
official
business
a
large
useless
reflecting
telescope
ramage
on
the
plan
and
nearly
of
the
size
of
sir
herschel
principal
telescope
encumbered
the
centre
of
the
front
court
on
i
addressed
mr
buck
agent
of
the
princess
sophia
of
gloucester
ranger
of
greenwich
park
for
leave
to
enclose
a
portion
of
the
ground
overlooking
my
garden
this
was
soon
granted
and
i
was
partially
delivered
from
the
inconvenience
of
the
public
gaze
the
liberation
was
not
complete
till
the
magnetic
ground
was
enclosed
in
in
the
inferior
departments
of
the
admiralty
especially
in
the
hydrographic
office
then
represented
by
captain
beaufort
with
which
i
was
principally
connected
the
observatory
was
considered
rather
as
a
place
for
managing
government
chronometers
than
as
a
place
of
science
the
preceding
first
assistant
taylor
had
kept
a
book
of
letter
references
and
i
found
that
out
of
letters
related
to
government
chronometers
only
on
i
mentally
sketched
my
regulations
for
my
own
share
in
chronometer
business
i
had
some
correspondence
with
captain
beaufort
but
we
could
not
agree
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
admiralty
finally
arrangements
were
made
which
put
the
chronometer
business
in
proper
subordination
to
the
scientific
charge
of
the
observatory
in
my
first
negociations
with
the
admiralty
referring
to
acceptance
of
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
in
lord
auckland
being
then
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
i
had
stipulated
that
as
my
successor
at
cambridge
would
be
unprepared
to
carry
on
my
lectures
i
should
have
permission
to
give
a
final
course
of
lectures
there
at
the
end
of
lord
auckland
was
succeeded
by
lord
minto
i
claimed
the
permission
from
him
and
he
refused
it
when
this
was
known
in
cambridge
a
petition
was
presented
by
many
cambridge
residents
and
lord
minto
yielded
on
april
i
went
to
cambridge
with
my
wife
residing
at
the
bull
inn
and
began
lectures
on
april
they
continued
apparently
to
may
my
was
crowded
the
number
of
names
was
and
the
lectures
gave
great
satisfaction
i
offered
to
the
admiralty
to
put
all
the
profits
in
their
hands
and
transmitted
a
cheque
to
the
accountant
general
of
the
navy
but
the
admiralty
declined
to
receive
them
on
june
the
annual
visitation
of
the
observatory
was
held
mr
baily
in
the
chair
i
presented
a
written
report
on
the
observatory
a
custom
which
i
had
introduced
at
cambridge
in
which
i
did
not
suppress
the
expression
of
my
feelings
about
chronometer
business
the
hydrographer
captain
beaufort
who
was
one
of
the
official
visitors
was
irritated
and
by
his
influence
the
report
was
not
printed
i
kept
it
and
succeeding
reports
safe
for
three
years
and
then
the
board
of
visitors
agreed
to
print
them
and
four
reports
were
printed
together
and
bound
with
the
greenwich
observations
of
in
the
course
of
this
year
i
completed
the
volume
of
observations
made
at
cambridge
observatory
in
and
on
the
printed
copies
were
distributed
about
the
end
of
the
dome
for
the
northumberland
telescope
was
erected
but
apparently
the
polar
frame
was
not
erected
the
following
account
of
an
accident
which
occurred
during
the
construction
of
the
dome
is
extracted
from
a
letter
by
airy
to
his
wife
dated
the
workmen
account
of
the
dome
blowing
off
is
very
curious
it
must
have
been
a
strange
gust
it
started
suddenly
when
the
men
were
all
inside
and
beaumont
was
looking
up
at
it
the
cannon
balls
were
thrown
in
with
great
violence
one
of
them
going
between
the
spokes
of
ransomes
large
casting
and
instantly
after
the
dome
had
started
the
boards
of
the
outside
scaffolding
which
had
been
tossed
up
by
the
same
gust
dropped
down
into
the
gap
which
the
dome
had
left
it
is
a
wonder
that
none
of
the
men
were
hurt
and
that
the
iron
was
not
broken
the
dome
is
quite
covered
and
i
think
does
not
look
so
well
as
when
the
hooping
was
visible
previous
to
i
had
begun
to
contemplate
the
attachment
of
magnetic
observations
to
the
observatory
and
had
corresponded
with
christie
lloyd
forbes
and
mr
gauss
on
the
subject
on
i
addressed
a
formal
letter
to
the
admiralty
and
on
received
their
answer
that
they
had
referred
it
to
the
board
of
visitors
on
march
i
received
authority
for
the
expenditure
of
and
i
believe
that
i
then
ordered
merz
magnet
the
visitors
met
on
and
after
some
discussion
the
site
was
chosen
and
the
extent
of
ground
generally
defined
and
on
mr
spring
rice
lord
monteagle
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
virtually
effected
the
transfer
of
the
ground
but
no
further
steps
were
taken
in
a
letter
on
a
systematic
course
of
magnetic
observations
in
various
parts
of
the
world
was
addressed
by
baron
alexander
humboldt
to
the
duke
of
sussex
president
of
the
royal
society
and
was
referred
to
christie
and
me
we
reported
on
it
on
june
strongly
recommending
the
adoption
of
the
scheme
a
plan
had
been
proposed
by
the
promoters
of
the
london
and
gravesend
railway
landman
engineer
for
carrying
a
railway
at
high
level
across
the
bottom
of
the
park
on
i
received
orders
from
the
admiralty
to
examine
into
its
possible
effect
in
producing
vibrations
in
the
observatory
after
much
correspondence
examination
of
ground
i
fixed
upon
a
part
of
the
greenwich
railway
not
yet
opened
for
traffic
near
the
place
where
the
croydon
trunk
line
now
joins
it
as
the
place
for
trains
to
run
upon
while
i
made
observations
with
a
telescope
viewing
a
collimator
by
reflection
in
mercury
at
the
distance
of
feet
the
experiments
were
made
on
and
i
reported
on
it
was
shewn
that
there
would
be
some
danger
to
the
observatory
on
mr
james
walker
engineer
brought
a
model
of
a
railway
to
pass
by
tunnel
under
the
lower
part
of
the
park
apparently
this
scheme
was
not
pressed
in
addition
to
the
routine
work
of
the
observatory
a
special
set
of
observations
were
made
to
determine
the
mass
of
also
the
solar
eclipse
of
may
was
observed
at
greenwich
in
the
manner
which
i
had
introduced
at
the
ordnance
zenith
sector
and
the
instruments
for
the
st
helena
observatory
were
brought
for
much
attention
was
given
to
chronometers
and
various
steps
were
taken
for
their
i
had
some
important
correspondence
with
mr
sir
john
lubbock
upon
the
lunar
theory
generally
and
his
proposed
empirical
lunar
tables
this
was
the
first
germ
of
the
great
reduction
of
lunar
observations
which
i
subsequently
carried
in
october
i
was
nominated
on
the
council
of
the
royal
society
having
been
admitted
a
fellow
on
i
was
president
of
the
astronomical
society
during
this
and
the
preceding
year
and
my
connection
with
groombridge
catalogue
of
stars
began
in
and
the
examination
in
concert
with
mr
baily
of
the
edition
printed
by
mr
henry
taylor
resulted
in
its
condemnation
in
i
volunteered
to
the
admiralty
to
prepare
a
new
edition
and
received
their
thanks
and
their
authority
for
proceeding
it
required
a
great
deal
of
examination
of
details
and
much
time
was
spent
on
it
in
but
it
was
not
brought
to
the
state
of
readiness
for
press
my
predecessor
mr
pond
died
on
and
was
interred
in
halley
tomb
in
lee
churchyard
the
following
letter
was
written
by
airy
in
support
of
the
application
for
a
pension
to
mrs
pond
who
had
been
left
in
great
distress
to
henry
warburton
esq
the
points
upon
which
in
my
opinion
mr
pond
claims
to
the
gratitude
of
astronomers
are
founded
are
principally
the
following
and
chief
the
accuracy
which
he
introduced
into
all
the
principal
observations
this
is
a
thing
which
from
its
nature
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
estimate
now
so
long
after
the
change
has
been
made
and
i
can
only
say
that
so
far
as
i
can
ascertain
from
books
the
change
is
one
of
very
great
extent
for
certainty
and
accuracy
astronomy
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
it
was
and
this
is
mainly
due
to
mr
pond
the
most
striking
exemplification
of
this
is
in
his
laborious
working
out
of
every
conceivable
cause
or
indication
of
error
in
the
circle
and
the
two
circles
but
very
great
praise
is
also
due
for
the
new
system
which
he
introduced
in
working
the
transit
in
comparing
mr
pond
systems
of
observation
with
dr
maskelyne
no
one
can
avoid
being
impressed
with
the
inferiority
of
dr
maskelyne
it
is
very
important
to
notice
that
the
continental
observatories
which
have
since
attracted
so
much
attention
did
not
at
that
time
exist
or
did
not
exist
in
vigour
the
attention
bestowed
by
mr
pond
on
those
points
chiefly
of
sidereal
astronomy
which
he
regarded
as
fundamental
to
which
such
masses
of
observations
were
directed
as
entirely
to
remove
the
doubts
from
probable
error
of
individual
observations
or
chance
circumstances
which
have
injured
many
other
determinations
the
regularity
of
observation
the
effect
of
all
these
has
been
that
since
the
commencement
of
mr
residence
at
greenwich
astronomy
considered
as
an
accurate
representation
of
the
state
of
the
heavens
in
the
most
material
points
has
acquired
a
certainty
and
an
extent
which
it
never
had
before
there
is
no
period
in
the
history
of
the
science
so
clean
on
some
matters
in
regard
to
the
choice
of
observations
i
might
say
that
my
own
judgment
would
have
differed
in
some
degree
from
mr
pond
but
one
thing
could
have
been
gained
only
by
giving
up
another
and
upon
the
general
accuracy
no
improvement
could
have
been
made
mr
pond
understood
nothing
of
physical
astronomy
but
neither
did
anybody
else
in
england
the
supposed
decrease
of
general
efficiency
in
the
last
few
years
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
following
causes
mr
pond
ill
health
the
inefficiency
of
his
first
assistant
the
oppression
of
business
connected
with
chronometers
the
last
of
these
as
i
have
reason
to
think
operated
very
far
business
of
this
nature
which
necessarily
is
and
will
always
prevail
over
that
which
is
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
an
account
of
the
various
ways
in
which
the
chronometer
business
teazed
the
astronomer
royal
several
alterations
having
been
made
at
my
representation
but
shall
merely
remark
that
much
of
the
business
had
no
connection
whatever
with
astronomy
i
beg
to
submit
these
remarks
to
your
perusal
requesting
you
to
point
out
to
me
of
them
should
be
laid
before
any
of
the
king
ministers
what
time
in
what
and
to
whom
addressed
i
am
quite
sure
that
mrs
pond
claims
require
nothing
to
ensure
favourable
consideration
but
the
impression
of
such
a
feeling
of
mr
pond
astronomical
merits
as
must
be
entertained
by
any
reasonable
astronomer
and
i
am
most
anxious
to
assist
in
conveying
this
impression
of
private
history
i
went
to
suffolk
for
a
week
on
mar
on
my
son
wilfrid
my
fourth
child
was
born
in
october
i
made
an
excursion
for
a
week
round
the
coast
of
kent
in
november
i
went
to
my
brother
house
at
keysoe
in
bedfordshire
i
was
much
exposed
to
cold
on
the
which
probably
aggravated
the
illness
that
soon
followed
from
i
was
ill
made
the
last
journal
entry
of
the
year
on
the
next
was
on
i
find
that
in
this
year
i
had
introduced
arthur
biddell
to
the
tithe
commutation
office
where
he
was
soon
favourably
received
and
from
which
connection
he
obtained
very
profitable
employment
as
a
valuer
my
connection
with
cambridge
observatory
was
not
yet
finished
i
had
determined
that
i
would
not
leave
a
figure
to
be
computed
by
my
successor
in
october
i
had
at
my
private
expense
set
mr
glaisher
to
work
on
reducing
the
observations
of
sun
moon
and
planets
made
in
and
subsequently
had
the
calculations
examined
by
mr
hartnup
this
employed
me
at
times
through
i
state
here
once
for
all
that
every
calculation
or
other
work
in
reference
to
the
cambridge
observatory
in
this
and
subsequent
years
was
done
at
my
private
expense
the
work
of
the
northumberland
telescope
was
going
on
through
the
year
from
to
i
was
at
cambridge
on
these
works
an
of
inches
aperture
a
most
unusual
size
at
this
time
when
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
or
glass
had
been
presented
to
the
greenwich
observatory
by
my
friend
mr
sheepshanks
and
on
mar
i
received
from
the
admiralty
authority
for
mounting
it
equatoreally
in
the
empty
south
dome
which
had
been
intended
for
a
copy
of
the
palermo
in
the
month
of
july
the
admiralty
wished
for
my
political
assistance
in
a
greenwich
election
but
i
refused
to
give
on
i
gave
notice
to
the
admiralty
that
i
had
finished
the
computations
of
groombridge
catalogue
and
was
ready
to
print
the
printing
was
authorized
and
proceeded
the
introduction
was
finished
on
but
the
book
was
not
quite
ready
till
the
beginning
of
in
connection
with
the
cavendish
experiment
on
june
i
wrote
to
spring
rice
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
for
which
was
soon
granted
and
from
this
time
there
is
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
mainly
with
mr
baily
upon
the
details
of
the
experiment
and
the
theory
of
the
on
july
i
saw
the
descent
of
the
parachute
by
which
mr
cocking
was
killed
i
attended
the
coroner
inquest
and
gave
evidence
a
few
days
later
the
planetary
reductions
from
to
had
been
going
on
the
computers
glaisher
hartnup
and
thomas
worked
in
the
octagon
room
and
considerable
advance
was
in
consequence
of
the
agitation
of
the
proposal
by
mr
lubbock
to
form
empirical
tables
of
the
moon
for
which
i
proposed
to
substitute
complete
reduction
of
the
observations
of
the
moon
from
the
british
association
at
york
appointed
a
deputation
including
myself
to
place
the
matter
before
the
government
i
wrote
on
the
matter
to
mr
wood
lord
halifax
stating
that
it
would
be
proper
to
raise
the
first
assistant
salary
and
to
give
me
more
indefinite
power
about
employing
computers
in
all
these
things
i
received
cordial
assistance
from
mr
wood
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
mr
spring
rice
received
us
on
statements
were
furnished
by
me
and
the
business
was
sanctioned
during
this
year
i
was
very
much
engaged
in
correspondence
with
lubbock
and
others
on
improvements
of
the
lunar
theory
in
the
operations
of
and
a
great
quantity
of
papers
had
been
accumulated
i
had
kept
them
in
reasonably
good
order
tied
up
in
bundles
but
this
method
began
to
fail
in
convenience
as
the
number
increased
the
great
lines
of
classification
were
however
now
well
understood
i
believe
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
that
i
finally
settled
on
the
principle
of
arranging
papers
in
packets
and
subordinate
packets
every
paper
being
flat
by
the
use
of
four
punched
holes
in
every
paper
i
have
never
seen
any
principle
of
arrangement
comparable
to
this
it
has
been
adopted
with
the
greatest
ease
by
every
assistant
and
is
used
to
the
present
time
without
alteration
on
i
was
informed
unofficially
by
mr
wood
admiralty
secretary
that
the
addition
of
the
magnetic
ground
was
sanctioned
on
mr
rhodes
an
officer
of
the
department
of
woods
and
works
came
to
put
me
formally
in
possession
of
the
ground
between
apr
and
may
the
ground
was
enclosed
and
my
garden
was
completely
protected
from
the
public
the
plan
of
the
building
was
settled
and
numerous
experiments
were
made
on
various
kinds
of
concrete
at
last
it
was
decided
to
build
with
wood
after
a
dinner
given
by
lord
burlington
chancellor
the
first
meeting
of
the
london
university
was
held
on
mar
and
others
followed
on
apr
i
handed
to
the
chancellor
a
written
protest
against
a
vote
of
a
salary
of
to
the
registrar
which
salary
in
fact
the
government
refused
to
sanction
dissensions
on
the
question
of
religious
examination
were
already
beginning
but
i
took
little
part
in
them
in
mr
henderson
had
resigned
the
superintendance
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
observatory
and
mr
maclear
was
appointed
i
recommended
the
same
official
instructions
for
him
they
had
included
an
allusion
to
la
caille
arc
of
meridian
with
an
addition
on
the
probability
of
trigonometrical
survey
on
on
i
wrote
to
beaufort
suggesting
that
bradley
sector
should
be
used
for
verifying
the
astronomical
determinations
and
subsequently
received
the
approval
of
the
admiralty
in
june
sir
herschel
and
i
had
an
interview
with
mr
wood
on
the
cape
equipment
generally
the
sector
was
erected
with
its
new
mounting
careful
drawings
were
made
of
every
part
instructions
were
prepared
for
its
use
and
on
it
was
sent
to
woolwich
dockyard
and
shipped
for
the
cape
of
private
history
on
i
started
with
my
wife
for
an
excursion
in
south
wales
on
i
gave
a
lecture
in
the
town
hall
of
neath
while
at
swansea
we
received
news
of
the
death
of
my
wife
father
the
rev
richard
smith
and
returned
at
in
this
year
arthur
biddell
bought
the
little
eye
estate
for
me
cambridge
observatory
on
i
had
set
mr
glaisher
to
work
in
collecting
the
annual
results
for
from
the
cambridge
observations
to
form
one
catalogue
i
examined
the
calculations
and
the
deduced
catalogue
and
on
presented
it
to
the
royal
astronomical
society
under
the
title
of
first
cambridge
catalogue
for
the
northumberland
telescope
i
was
engaged
with
simms
about
the
clockwork
from
time
to
time
up
to
apr
and
went
to
cambridge
about
it
the
instrument
was
brought
to
a
useable
state
but
some
small
parts
were
still
wanting
at
greenwich
in
april
i
drew
up
a
little
history
of
the
observatory
for
the
penny
on
june
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
paid
a
short
visit
to
the
observatory
on
this
occasion
mr
wood
suggested
a
passage
connecting
the
observatory
with
the
and
i
subsequently
prepared
sketches
for
it
it
was
made
in
the
next
in
the
course
of
the
year
the
sheepshanks
equatoreal
was
mounted
and
encke
comet
was
observed
with
it
from
to
nov
on
mar
i
reported
to
the
admiralty
on
the
selection
of
chronometers
for
purchase
from
a
long
list
this
was
an
important
beginning
of
a
new
the
magnetic
observatory
was
built
in
the
form
originally
planned
for
it
a
cross
with
equal
arms
one
axis
being
in
the
magnetic
meridian
in
the
beginning
of
this
year
no
alteration
has
since
been
made
in
form
up
to
the
present
time
except
that
the
north
arm
has
been
lengthened
feet
a
few
years
ago
on
may
a
magnet
was
suspended
for
the
first
time
mr
baily
and
lieut
afterwards
sir
william
denison
being
groombridge
catalogue
was
finished
and
on
mar
i
arranged
for
sending
out
the
planetary
reductions
were
carried
on
vigorously
on
may
the
treasury
assented
to
the
undertaking
of
the
lunar
reductions
and
allotted
for
it
preparations
were
made
and
in
the
autumn
computers
were
employed
upon
it
it
will
easily
be
seen
that
this
undertaking
added
much
to
my
labours
and
the
geodetic
affairs
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
began
to
be
actively
pressed
and
in
february
beaufort
wrote
to
me
in
consequence
of
an
application
from
maclear
asking
about
a
standard
of
length
for
maclear
as
foundation
for
a
geodetic
survey
i
made
enquiries
and
on
mar
wrote
to
mr
wood
alluding
also
generally
to
the
want
of
a
national
english
standard
after
the
destruction
of
the
houses
of
parliament
on
apr
the
admiralty
sanctioned
my
procuring
proper
standard
in
connection
with
the
cavendish
experiment
i
have
an
immense
quantity
of
correspondence
with
mr
baily
and
all
the
mathematics
were
furnished
by
me
the
experiment
was
not
finished
at
the
end
of
the
the
perturbations
of
uranus
were
now
attracting
attention
i
had
had
some
correspondence
on
this
subject
with
dr
hussey
in
and
in
with
eugène
bouvard
on
of
i
wrote
to
schumacher
regarding
the
error
in
the
tabular
of
uranus
which
my
mode
of
reducing
the
observations
enabled
me
to
see
the
national
standards
of
length
and
weight
had
been
destroyed
in
the
fire
of
the
houses
of
parliament
on
may
i
received
a
letter
from
mr
spring
rice
requesting
me
to
act
as
chairman
with
a
committee
consisting
of
baily
drinkwater
bethune
davies
gilbert
lefevre
lubbock
peacock
and
sheepshanks
to
report
on
the
steps
now
to
be
taken
i
accepted
the
charge
and
the
first
meeting
was
held
at
the
observatory
on
may
all
subsequent
meetings
in
london
usually
in
the
apartments
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
i
acted
both
as
chairman
and
as
working
secretary
our
enquiries
went
into
a
very
wide
field
and
i
had
much
correspondence
on
mr
wood
wrote
to
me
mentioning
that
capt
johnson
had
made
some
observations
on
the
magnetism
of
iron
ships
and
asking
whether
they
ought
to
be
continued
a
steamer
being
offered
at
per
week
i
applied
to
beaufort
for
a
copy
of
johnson
observations
and
on
replied
very
fully
discouraging
such
observations
but
recommending
a
train
of
observations
expressly
directed
to
theoretical
points
on
i
reported
that
i
had
examined
the
deptford
basin
and
found
that
it
would
do
fairly
well
for
experiments
on
july
capt
beaufort
wrote
to
me
that
the
admiralty
wished
for
experiments
on
the
ship
the
then
in
the
river
and
enquired
whether
i
would
undertake
them
and
what
assistance
i
desired
as
for
instance
that
of
christie
or
barlow
i
replied
that
one
person
should
undertake
it
either
christie
barlow
or
myself
and
that
a
basin
was
desirable
on
july
and
i
looked
at
the
basins
of
woolwich
and
deptford
approving
the
latter
on
july
the
admiralty
gave
me
full
powers
from
july
i
was
almost
entirely
employed
on
preparations
the
course
of
operations
is
described
in
my
printed
paper
the
original
maps
curves
and
graphical
projections
are
in
the
bound
mss
of
compass
in
iron
ships
rainbow
at
the
greenwich
observatory
the
angular
disturbances
were
found
on
july
and
requiring
some
further
work
on
a
raft
so
that
they
were
finally
worked
out
on
i
struggled
hard
with
the
numbers
but
should
not
have
succeeded
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
to
examine
the
horizontal
magnetic
intensities
this
was
done
on
and
the
explanation
of
the
whole
was
suggested
at
once
graphical
projections
were
made
on
and
for
comparison
of
my
explanation
with
observations
and
the
business
was
complete
on
and
i
measured
the
intensity
of
some
magnets
to
be
used
in
the
ship
for
correction
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
besides
the
effect
of
polar
magnetism
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
existence
of
an
effect
of
induced
magnetism
requiring
correction
by
other
induced
magnetism
and
experiments
for
this
were
made
in
the
magnetic
observatory
all
was
ready
for
trial
and
on
i
carried
my
magnets
and
iron
correctors
to
deptford
mounted
them
in
the
proper
places
tried
the
ship
and
the
compass
which
had
been
disturbed
degrees
to
the
right
and
degrees
to
the
left
was
now
sensibly
correct
on
i
reported
this
to
the
admiralty
and
on
i
tried
the
ship
to
gravesend
on
i
had
the
loan
of
her
for
an
expedition
with
a
party
of
friends
to
sheerness
and
on
i
accompanied
her
to
gravesend
on
her
first
voyage
to
on
application
was
made
to
me
by
the
owner
of
the
to
correct
her
compasses
in
consequence
of
this
i
went
to
liverpool
on
and
on
this
occasion
made
a
very
important
improvement
in
the
practical
mode
of
performing
the
on
i
reported
to
the
admiralty
in
considerable
detail
on
i
had
an
interview
with
lord
minto
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
mr
wood
they
refused
to
sanction
any
reward
to
the
following
is
a
copy
of
the
report
of
the
captain
of
the
after
her
voyage
to
antwerp
had
the
command
of
the
rainbow
steamer
the
two
voyages
between
london
and
antwerp
i
have
the
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
compasses
and
feel
quite
certain
they
will
continue
so
i
took
particular
notice
from
land
to
land
from
our
departure
and
found
the
bearings
by
compass
to
be
exact
the
following
extracts
from
letters
to
his
wife
refer
to
the
ironsides
on
he
writes
i
worked
up
the
observations
so
much
as
to
see
that
the
compass
disturbance
is
not
so
great
as
in
the
instead
of
but
quite
enough
to
make
the
vessel
worthless
and
that
it
is
quite
different
in
direction
from
that
in
the
so
that
if
they
had
stolen
one
of
the
correctors
and
put
it
into
this
ship
it
would
have
been
much
worse
than
before
and
on
he
writes
on
wednesday
i
again
went
to
the
ship
and
tried
small
alterations
in
the
correctors
i
am
confident
now
that
the
thing
is
very
near
but
we
were
most
abominably
baffled
by
the
sluggishness
of
the
compass
the
university
of
london
on
i
attended
a
meeting
on
the
minimum
of
acquirements
for
degree
and
various
meetings
of
the
senate
on
july
i
intimated
to
mr
spring
rice
my
wish
to
resign
i
had
various
correspondence
especially
with
mr
lubbock
and
on
i
wrote
to
him
on
the
necessity
of
stipends
to
members
of
senate
the
dissensions
on
religious
examination
became
very
strong
i
took
a
middle
course
demanding
examination
in
the
languages
and
books
but
absolutely
refusing
to
claim
any
religious
assent
i
expressed
this
to
dr
jerrard
the
principal
representative
on
the
religious
side
by
calling
on
him
to
substitute
the
words
of
christian
literature
for
of
christian
religion
i
addressed
a
printed
letter
to
lord
burlington
chancellor
and
the
members
of
the
senate
on
this
subject
of
private
history
in
january
i
made
a
short
excursion
in
norfolk
and
suffolk
and
visited
sedgwick
at
norwich
in
april
i
paid
a
short
visit
to
mr
courtney
at
sanderstead
with
my
wife
on
june
my
son
hubert
was
born
in
september
i
went
with
my
sister
by
cambridge
to
luddington
where
i
made
much
enquiry
concerning
my
father
and
the
family
of
airy
who
had
long
been
settled
there
we
then
visited
various
places
in
yorkshire
and
arrived
at
brampton
near
chesterfield
where
mrs
smith
my
wife
mother
now
resided
and
returned
by
rugby
i
had
much
correspondence
with
my
brother
and
for
him
about
private
pupils
and
a
better
church
living
i
complained
to
the
bishop
of
norwich
about
the
mutilation
of
a
celebrated
monument
in
playford
church
by
the
incumbent
and
curate
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
to
his
wife
relating
to
the
journeys
close
norwich
i
do
not
know
what
degree
of
cold
you
may
have
had
last
night
but
here
it
was
i
believe
colder
than
before
thermometer
close
to
the
house
at
i
have
not
suffered
at
all
however
i
do
not
intend
to
go
to
lowestoft
brampton
we
began
to
think
that
we
had
seen
enough
of
scarborough
so
we
took
a
chaise
in
the
afternoon
to
pickering
a
small
agricultural
town
and
lodged
in
a
comfortable
inn
there
on
wednesday
morning
at
we
started
by
the
railroad
for
whitby
in
a
huge
carriage
denominated
the
lady
hilda
capable
of
containing
persons
or
more
drawn
by
one
horse
or
in
the
steep
parts
of
the

are
extremely
pretty

that
it
was
the
most
agreeable
travelling
that
she
ever
had
yesterday
saturday
caroline
drove
betsy
and
miss
barnes
drove
me
to
clay
cross
to
see
the
works
at
the
great
railroad
tunnel
there
coming
from
the
north
the
railroad
passes
up
the
chesterfield
valley
close
by
the
town
and
continues
up
the
same
valley
till
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
enter
the

which
runs
the
opposite

towards
buttersley
the

passes
under
the
high

between
these
two
vallies
so
that
it
is
in
reality
at
the
it
is
to
be
i
think
more
than
a
mile
long
and
when
finished
feet
clear
in

so
it
is
a

saw

cambridge
observatory
on
mar
i
went
to
cambridge
on
the
business
of
the
northumberland
telescope
i
was
subsequently
engaged
on
the
accounts
and
on
i
finally
resigned
it
to
challis
who
accepted
it
on
on
i
communicated
its
completion
and
the
settlement
of
accounts
to
the
duke
of
northumberland
the
total
expense
was
francs
for
the
at
greenwich
observatory
on
i
received
the
last
revise
of
the
observations
and
on
the
first
sheet
for
in
july
i
report
on
selection
from
a
long
list
of
chronometers
which
had
been
on
trial
and
on
i
pointed
out
to
capt
beaufort
that
the
system
of
offering
only
one
price
would
be
ruinous
to
the
manufacture
of
chronometers
and
to
the
character
of
those
supplied
to
the
admiralty
and
that
i
would
undertake
any
trouble
of
classifying
the
chronometers
tried
this
letter
introduced
the
system
still
in
use
which
has
been
most
beneficial
to
the
manufacture
on
i
proposed
that
all
trials
begin
in
the
first
week
of
january
this
also
has
been
in
use
as
an
established
system
to
the
present
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
a
certain
chronometer
was
affected
by
external
magnetic
power
i
remedied
this
by
placing
under
it
a
free
compass
magnet
a
stand
was
specially
prepared
for
it
i
have
never
found
another
chronometer
sensibly
affected
by
in
november
and
december
i
tried
my
new
between
may
and
a
fireproof
room
was
constructed
in
the
southern
part
of
the
quadrant
room
and
in
november
a
small
shed
was
erected
over
the
entrance
to
the
north
the
position
of
the
free
meridional
magnet
now
mounted
in
the
magnetic
observatory
was
observed
at
every
through
hours
on
and
may
and
and
and
and
this
was
done
in
cooperation
with
the
system
of
the
magnetic
union
established
by
gauss
in
the
reduction
of
the
greenwich
planetary
and
lunar
observations
to
went
on
steadily
i
had
six
and
sometimes
seven
computers
constantly
at
work
in
the
octagon
as
in
i
had
a
great
amount
of
correspondence
with
mr
baily
on
the
cavendish
i
attended
as
regularly
as
i
could
to
the
business
of
the
university
of
london
the
religious
question
did
not
rise
very
prominently
i
took
a
very
active
part
and
have
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
on
the
nature
of
the
intended
examinations
in
hydrography
and
civil
on
the
standards
commission
the
chief
work
was
in
external
on
june
i
had
enquiries
from
john
quincey
adams
on
the
expense
of
observatories
an
observatory
was
contemplated
in
i
had
correspondence
about
the
proposed
establishment
of
observatories
at
durham
glasgow
and
liverpool
i
had
in
this
year
a
great
deal
of
troublesome
and
on
the
whole
unpleasant
correspondence
with
the
admiralty
about
the
correction
of
the
compass
in
iron
ships
i
naturally
expected
some
acknowledgment
of
an
important
service
rendered
to
navigation
but
the
admiralty
peremptorily
refused
it
my
account
of
the
experiments
for
the
royal
society
is
dated
april
the
general
success
of
the
undertaking
soon
became
notorious
and
as
i
understood
led
immediately
to
extensive
building
of
iron
ships
and
it
led
also
to
applications
to
me
for
correction
of
compasses
on
i
was
addressed
in
reference
to
the
royal
sovereign
and
royal
george
at
liverpool
july
the
orwell
may
two
russian
ships
built
on
the
thames
the
ships
of
the
lancaster
company
i
had
much
work
in
connection
with
the
cape
of
good
hope
observatory
chiefly
relating
to
the
instrumental
equipment
and
to
the
geodetical
work
as
it
was
considered
advisable
that
any
base
measured
in
the
cape
colony
should
be
measured
with
compensation
bars
i
applied
to
major
jervis
for
the
loan
of
those
belonging
to
the
east
indian
survey
but
he
positively
refused
to
lend
them
on
i
applied
to
colby
for
the
compensation
bars
of
the
british
survey
and
he
immediately
assented
to
lending
them
colby
had
suggested
to
the
ordnance
department
that
capt
henderson
and
several
sappers
should
be
sent
to
use
the
measuring
bars
and
it
was
so
arranged
it
still
appeared
desirable
to
have
the
command
of
some
soldiers
from
the
garrison
of
cape
town
and
this
matter
was
soon
arranged
with
the
military
authorities
by
the
admiralty
the
following
are
the
principal
points
of
my
private
history
it
was
a
very
sad
year
on
i
went
with
my
wife
to
norwich
on
a
visit
to
sedgwick
and
in
june
i
visited
sir
herschel
at
slough
on
june
my
dear
boy
arthur
was
taken
ill
his
malady
soon
proved
to
be
scarlet
fever
of
which
he
died
on
june
at
in
the
morning
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
be
buried
in
playford
churchyard
on
the
and
on
that
day
i
proceeded
to
playford
with
my
wife
and
my
eldest
son
george
richard
at
chelmsford
my
son
was
attacked
with
slight
sickness
and
being
a
little
unwell
did
not
attend
his
brother
funeral
on
july
at
in
the
morning
he
also
died
he
had
some
time
before
suffered
severely
from
an
attack
of
measles
and
it
seemed
probable
that
his
brain
had
suffered
on
july
he
was
buried
by
the
side
of
his
brother
arthur
in
playford
on
july
i
went
to
colchester
on
my
way
to
with
my
wife
and
all
my
family
all
my
children
had
been
touched
though
very
lightly
with
the
scarlet
it
was
near
the
end
of
this
year
that
my
mother
quitted
the
house
luck
at
playford
and
came
to
live
with
me
at
greenwich
observatory
where
she
lived
till
her
death
having
her
own
attendant
and
living
in
perfect
confidence
with
my
wife
and
myself
and
being
i
trust
as
happy
as
her
years
and
widowhood
permitted
my
sister
also
lived
with
me
at
the
observatory
in
the
latter
part
of
and
through
i
had
much
correspondence
with
the
admiralty
in
which
i
obtained
a
complete
account
of
the
transfer
of
the
observatory
from
the
ordnance
department
to
the
admiralty
and
the
transfer
of
the
visitation
of
the
observatory
from
the
royal
society
to
the
present
board
of
visitors
in
i
found
that
the
papers
of
the
board
of
longitude
were
divided
between
the
royal
society
and
the
admiralty
i
obtained
the
consent
of
both
to
bring
them
to
the
observatory
in
this
year
i
began
to
arrange
about
an
annual
dinner
to
be
held
at
the
my
micrometer
was
much
used
for
observations
of
circumpolar
double
in
magnetism
and
meteorology
certain
quarterly
observations
were
kept
up
but
in
november
the
system
of
incessant
was
commenced
i
refused
to
commence
this
until
i
had
secured
a
clock
for
mechanical
verification
of
the
regular
attendance
of
the
with
regard
to
chronometers
in
this
year
for
the
first
time
i
took
the
very
important
step
of
publishing
the
rates
obtained
by
comparisons
at
the
observatory
i
confined
myself
on
this
occasion
to
the
chronometers
purchased
by
the
admiralty
in
march
a
was
made
for
exposure
of
chronometers
to
the
lunar
and
planetary
reductions
were
going
on
i
was
consulted
about
an
observatory
at
oxford
where
i
supported
the
introduction
of
the
the
stipend
of
the
bakerian
lecture
was
paid
to
me
for
my
explanation
of
brewster
new
prismatic
the
business
of
the
cape
observatory
and
survey
occupied
much
of
my
in
the
rev
j
rose
editor
of
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
had
proposed
my
writing
a
paper
on
tides
in
i
gave
him
notice
that
i
must
connect
tides
with
waves
and
in
that
way
i
will
take
up
the
subject
much
correspondence
on
tides
with
whewell
and
others
followed
with
regard
to
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
establishment
on
june
mr
lubbock
reported
from
the
committee
of
physics
of
the
royal
society
to
the
council
in
favour
of
a
magnetic
and
meteorological
observatory
near
london
after
correspondence
with
sheepshanks
lord
northampton
and
herschel
i
wrote
to
the
council
on
july
pointing
out
what
the
admiralty
had
done
at
greenwich
and
offering
to
cooperate
in
a
letter
to
lord
minto
i
stated
that
my
estimate
was
including
to
the
first
assistant
lubbock
was
on
the
treasury
assented
limiting
it
to
the
duration
of
ross
voyage
on
wheatstone
looked
at
our
buildings
and
was
satisfied
my
estimate
was
sent
to
the
admiralty
viz
outfit
annual
expense
and
glaisher
to
be
superintendent
i
believe
this
was
allowed
for
the
present
for
the
following
year
it
was
placed
on
the
estimates
most
of
the
contemplated
observations
were
begun
before
the
end
of
as
much
as
possible
in
conformity
with
the
royal
society
plan
mr
hind
subsequently
the
superintendent
of
the
nautical
almanac
and
mr
paul
were
the
first
extra
assistants
of
private
history
on
i
went
to
cambridge
with
my
paper
on
the
going

on
mar
i
went
to
visit
mrs

winchester
portsmouth
in
june
from
to
i
was
travelling
in
the
north
of
england
and
south
of
scotland
this
was
an
extremely
active
and
interesting
journey
in
the
course
of
which
a
great
number
of
places
were
visited
by
airy
especially
places
on
the
border
mentioned
in
scott
poems
which
always
had
a
great
attraction
for
him
he
also
attended
a
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
glasgow
and
made
a
statement
regarding
the
planetary
and
lunar
reductions
and
looked
at
a

the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
to
his
wife
some
of
them
relate
to
matters
of
general
interest
they
are
all
of
them
characteristic
and
serve
to
shew
the
keen
interest
which
he
took
in
matters
around
him
and
especially
in
architecture
and
scenery
the
first
letter
relates
to
his
journey
from
chesterfield
on
the
previous
day
flamsteed
house
april
i
was
obliged
to
put
up
with
an
outside
place
to
derby
yesterday
much
against
my
will
for
i
was
apprehensive
that
the
cold
would
bring
on
the
pain
in
my
face
of
that
i
had
not
much
but
i
have
caught
something
of
sore
throat
and
catarrh
the
coach
came
up
at
about
minutes
past
it
arrived
in
derby
at
minutes
or
less
past
same
guard
and
coachman
who
brought
us
and
drew
up
in
the
street
opposite
the
inn
at
which
we
got
no
dinner
abreast
of
an
omnibus
i
had
to
go
to
a
coach
office
opposite
the
inn
to
pay
and
be
booked
for
london
and
was
duly
set
down
in
a
with
and
then
entered
the
omnibus
was
transferred
to
the
railway
station
and
then
received
the
railway
ticket
by
shouting
out
my
name
if
you
should
come
the
same
way
you
would
find
it
convenient
to
book
your
place
at
chesterfield
to
london
by
your
name
paying
for
the
whole
namely
coach
fare
omnibus
fare
and
railway
fare
first
class
then
you
will
only
have
to
step
out
of
the
coach
into
the
omnibus
and
to
scream
out
once
or
twice
to
the
guard
to
make
sure
that
you
are
entered
in
the
and
that
your
luggage
is
put
on
the
omnibus
flamsteed
house
greenwich
april
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
at
lord
northampton
i
saw
some
specimens
of
the
daguerrotype
pictures
made
by
the
camera
obscura
and
they
surpass
in
beauty
of
execution
anything
that
i
could
have
imagined
baily
who
has
two
or
three
has
promised
to
lend
them
for
your
inspection
when
you
return
also
i
saw
some
stamps
and
stamped
envelopes
i
do
not
much
admire
the
latter
the
following
relates
to
the
fire
on
his
eye
farm
referred
to
above
playford
april
on
wednesday
yesterday
went
with
my
uncle
to
the
eye
estate
to
see
the
effects
of
the
fire
the
farming
buildings
of
every
kind
are
as
completely
cleared
away
as
if
they
had
been
mown
down
not
a
bit
of
anything
but
one
or
two
short
brick
walls
and
the
brick
foundations
of
the
barns
and
stacks
the
aspect
of
the
place
is
much
changed
because
in
approaching
the
house
you
do
not
see
it
upon
a
of
barns
but
standing
alone
the
house
is
in
particularly
neat
and
good
order
i
did
not
think
it
at
all
worth
while
to
make
troublesome
enquiries
of
the
people
who
reside
there
but
took
mr
account
there
seems
no
doubt
that
the
fire
was
caused
by
the
throwing
cinders
into
a
sort
of
into
which
they
had
been
commonly
thrown
i
suppose
there
was
after
all
this
dry
weather
straw
or
muck
drier
than
usual
and
the
cinders
were
hotter
than
usual
the
whole
was
on
fire
in
an
exceedingly
short
time
and
everything
was
down
in
less
than
an
hour
two
engines
came
from
eye
and
all
the
population
of
the
town
as
the
fire
began
shortly
after
two
in
the
afternoon
it
is
entirely
owing
to
these
that
my
house
and
the
farm
sewell
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
were
not
burned
down
at
the
beginning
of
the
fire
the
wind
was
which
blew
directly
towards
the
opposite
farm
sewell
although
the
nearest
part
of
it
tiled
dwelling
house
was
yards
off
or
near
it
and
the
great
barn
thatched
roof
considerably
further
yet
both
were
set
on
fire
several
times
all
this
while
the
tail
of
my
house
was
growing
very
hot
and
shortly
after
the
buildings
fell
in
burning
ruins
the
wind
changed
to
blowing
directly
to
my
house
if
this
change
had
happened
while
the
buildings
were
standing
and
burning
there
would
have
been
no
possibility
of
saving
the
house
as
it
was
the
solder
is
melted
from
the
window
next
the
and
the
roof
was
set
on
fire
in
three
or
four
places
one
engine
was
kept
working
on
my
house
and
one
on
the
opposite
farm
a
large
pond
was
pretty
nearly
emptied
mr
case
horses
and
bullocks
were
got
out
not
without
great
difficulty
as
the
progress
of
the
fire
was
fearfully
rapid
a
sow
and
nine
pigs
were
burnt
and
a
large
hog
ran
out
burnt
so
much
that
the
people
killed
it
immediately
george
inn
winchester
june
at
winchester
we
established
ourselves
at
the
george
and
then
without
delay
proceeded
to
st
cross
i
did
not
know
before
the
nature
of
its
hospital
establishment
but
i
find
that
it
is
a
veritable
set
of
the
church
is
a
most
curious
specimen
of
the
latest
norman
i
never
saw
one
so
well
marked
before
norman
ornaments
on
pointed
arches
pilasters
detached
with
cushion
capitals
and
various
signs
and
it
is
clearly
an
instance
of
that
state
of
the
style
when
people
had
been
forced
by
the
difficulties
and
inelegancies
of
the
round
arch
in
groining
to
adopt
pointed
arches
for
groining
but
had
not
learnt
to
use
them
for
windows
morning
after
breakfast
went
to
the
cathedral
looking
by
the
way
at
a
curious
old
cross
in
the
street
i
thought
that
its
inside
was
wholly
norman
and
was
most
agreeably
surprised
by
finding
the
whole
inside
groined
in
every
part
with
excellent
late
decorated
or
perpendicular
work
yet
there
are
several
signs
about
it
which
lead
me
to
think
that
the
whole
inside
has
been
norman
and
even
that
the
pilasters
now
worked
up
into
the
perpendicular
are
norman
the
transepts
are
most
massive
old
norman
with
running
round
their
ends
which
i
never
saw
before
the
groining
of
the
side
aisles
of
the
nave
very
effective
from
the
strength
of
the
cross
ribs
the
clerestory
windows
of
the
quire
very
large
the
organ
is
on
one
side
but
the
best
thing
about
the
quire
is
the
wooden
of
early
decorated
very
beautiful
a
superb
lady
chapel
of
early
english
portsmouth
june
we
left
winchester
by
evening
train
to
the
dolphin
southampton
and
slept
there
at
nine
in
the
morning
we
went
by
steamboat
down
the
river
to
ryde
in
the
isle
of
wight
our
steamer
was
going
on
to
portsmouth
but
we
thought
it
better
to
land
at
ryde
and
take
a
boat
for
ourselves
we
then
sailed
out
rather
a
blowing
day
to
the
vessel
attending
pasley
operations
and
after
a
good
deal
of
going
from
one
boat
to
another
the
sea
being
so
rough
that
our
boat
could
not
be
got
up
to
the
ships
and
a
good
deal
of
waiting
we
got
on
board
the
barge
or
lump
in
which
pasley
was
here
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
lowered
there
was
more
than
a
ton
of
gunpowder
and
seeing
the
divers
go
down
to
fix
it
dressed
in
their
diving
helmets
and
supplied
with
air
from
the
great
above
when
all
was
ready
and
the
divers
had
ascended
again
the
barge
in
which
we
were
was
warped
away
and
by
a
galvanic
battery
in
another
barge
which
we
had
seen
carried
there
and
whose
connection
with
the
barrel
we
had
seen
upon
signal
given
by
sound
of
trumpet
the
gunpowder
was
fired
the
effect
was
most
wonderful
the
firing
followed
the
signal
instantaneously
we
were
at
between
and
yards
from
the
place
as
i
judge
and
the
effects
were
as
follows
as
soon
as
the
signal
was
given
there
was
a
report
louder
than
a
musket
but
not
so
loud
as
a
small
cannon
and
a
severe
shock
was
felt
at
our
feet
just
as
if
our
barge
had
struck
on
a
rock
almost
immediately
a
very
slight
swell
was
perceived
over
the
place
of
the
explosion
and
the
water
looked
rather
foamy
then
in
about
a
second
it
began
to
rise
and
there
was
the
most
enormous
outbreak
of
spray
that
you
can
conceive
it
rose
in
one
column
of
or
feet
high
and
broad
at
the
base
resembling
a
stumpy
sheaf
with
jagged
masses
of
spray
spreading
out
at
the
sides
and
seemed
to
grow
outwards
till
i
almost
feared
that
it
was
coming
to
us
it
sunk
i
suppose
in
separate
parts
for
it
did
not
make
any
grand
squash
down
and
then
there
were
seen
logs
of
wood
rising
and
a
dense
mass
of
black
mud
which
spread
gradually
round
till
it
occupied
a
very
large
space
fish
were
stunned
by
it
our
boatmen
picked
up
some
it
was
said
by
all
present
that
this
was
the
best
explosion
which
had
been
seen
it
was
truly
wonderful
then
we
sailed
to
portsmouth
explosion
was
a
thing
worth
going
many
miles
to
see
there
were
many
yachts
and
sailing
boats
out
to
see
it
i
counted
before
they
were
at
the
fullest
so
that
the
scene
was
very
gay
here
are
some
notes
on
york
cathedral
after
the
fire
red
lion
hotel
redcar
my
first
letter
was
closed
after
service
at
york
cathedral
as
soon
as
i
had
posted
it
i
walked
sedately
twice
round
the
cathedral
and
then
i
found
the
sexton
at
the
door
who
commiserating
me
of
my
former
vain
applications
and
having
the
hope
of
lucre
before
his
eyes
let
me
in
i
saw
the
burnt
part
which
looks
not
melancholy
but
unfinished
every
bit
of
wood
is
carried
away
clean
with
scarcely
a
to
mark
where
it
has
been
the
building
looks
as
if
the
walls
were
just
prepared
for
a
roof
but
there
are
some
deep
dints
in
the
pavement
shewing
where
large
masses
have
fallen
the
lower
parts
of
some
of
the
columns
to
the
height
of
or
feet
are
much
scaled
and
cracked
the
windows
are
scarcely
touched
i
also
refreshed
my
memory
of
the
which
is
most
beautiful
and
which
has
much
of
its
old
gilding
reasonably
bright
and
some
of
its
old
paint
quite
conspicuous
and
i
looked
again
at
the
old
crypt
with
its
late
norman
work
and
at
the
still
older
crypt
of
the
church
the
routine
work
of
the
observatory
in
its
several
departments
was
carried
on
steadily
during
this
the
camera
obscura
was
removed
from
the
turret
of
the
great
room
to
make
way
for
the
in
magnetism
and
meteorology
the
most
important
thing
was
the
great
magnetic
storm
of
which
revealed
a
new
class
of
magnetic
phenomena
it
was
very
well
observed
by
mr
glaisher
and
i
immediately
printed
and
circulated
an
account
of
in
april
i
reported
that
the
planetary
reductions
were
completed
and
furnished
estimates
for
the
in
august
i
applied
for
copies
of
the
great
skeleton
form
for
computing
lunar
tabular
places
which
were
i
reported
as
usual
on
various
papers
for
the
royal
society
and
was
still
engaged
on
the
cavendish
in
the
university
of
london
i
attended
the
meeting
of
on
the
reduction
of
examiners
salaries
which
were
i
furnished
colby
with
a
plan
of
a
new
sector
still
used
in
the
british
i
appealed
to
colby
about
the
injury
to
the
cistern
on
the
great
gable
in
cumberland
by
the
pile
raised
for
the
survey
on
occurred
a
most
remarkable
tidal
disturbance
the
tide
in
the
thames
was
feet
too
low
i
endeavoured
to
trace
it
on
the
coasts
and
had
a
vast
amount
of
correspondence
but
it
elicited
little
of
private
history
i
was
a
short
time
in
suffolk
in
on
mar
i
started
with
my
wife
whose
health
had
suffered
much
for
a
trip
to
bath
bristol
cardiff
swansea
while
at
swansea
we
received
news
on
apr
of
the
deadly
illness
of
my
dear
mother
we
travelled
by
neath
and
cardiff
to
bath
where
i
solicited
a
rest
for
my
wife
from
my
kind
friend
miss
sutcliffe
and
returned
alone
to
greenwich
my
dear
mother
had
died
on
the
morning
of
the
the
funeral
took
place
at
little
whelnetham
near
bury
on
may
where
my
mother
was
buried
by
the
side
of
my
father
we
went
to
cambridge
where
my
wife
consulted
dr
haviland
to
her
great
advantage
and
returned
to
greenwich
on
may
on
may
to
i
was
at
sanderstead
rev
courtney
with
whewell
as
one
sponsor
at
the
christening
of
my
daughter
in
september
i
went
for
a
trip
with
my
sister
to
yorkshire
and
cumberland
in
the
course
of
which
we
visited
dent
sedgwick
birthplace
and
paid
visits
to
mr
wordsworth
miss
southey
and
miss
bristow
returning
to
greenwich
on
the
from
june
to
i
visited
my
brother
at
keysoe
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
written
to
his
wife
while
on
the
above
trip
in
yorkshire
and
cumberland
red
lion
inn
redcar
we
stopped
at
york
went
to
the
tavern
hotel
in
the
morning
friday
went
into
the
cathedral
i
think
that
it
improves
on
acquaintance
the
nave
is
now
almost
filled
with
scaffolding
for
the
repair
of
the
roof
so
that
it
has
not
the
bare
unfinished
appearance
that
it
had
when
i
was
there
last
year
the
tower
in
which
the
fire
began
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
repaired
there
are
new
mullions
in
its
windows
we
stopped
to
hear
part
of
the
service
which
was
not
very
effective
here
are
notes
of
his
visit
to
dentdale
in
yorkshire
the
birthplace
of
his
friend
sedgwick
king
head
kendal
the
day
was
quite
fine
and
the
hills
quite
clear
the
ascent
out
of
hawes
is
dull
the
little
branch
dale
is
simple
and
monotonous
and
so
are
the
hills
about
the
great
dale
which
are
in
sight
the
only
thing
which
interested
us
was
the
sort
of
view
of
hardraw
dell
which
appeared
a
most
petty
and
insignificant
opening
in
the
great
hill
side
but
when
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
pass
there
was
a
magnificent
view
of
ingleborough
the
dale
which
was
most
nearly
in
front
of
us
is
that
which
goes
down
to
ingleton
past
the
side
of
ingleborough
the
mountain
was
about
nine
miles
distant
we
turned
to
the
right
and
immediately
descended
the
three
dales
to
hawes
to
ingleton
and
to
dent
lay
their
heads
together
in
a
most
amicable
way
so
that
when
at
the
top
it
is
equally
easy
to
descend
down
either
of
them
we
found
very
soon
that
is
much
more
beautiful
than
that
by
which
we
had
ascended
the
sides
of
the
hills
are
steeper
and
perhaps
higher
the
bottom
is
richer
the
road
is
also
better
the
river
is
a
continued
succession
of
very
pretty
falls
almost
all
of
which
have
scooped
out
the
lower
strata
of
the
rock
so
that
the
water
shoots
clear
over
for
several
miles
perhaps
it
runs
upon
bare
limestone
without
a
particle
of
earth
from
the
head
of
the
dale
to
the
village
of
dent
is
eight
miles
at
about
is
a
new
chapel
very
neat
with
a
transept
at
its
west
end
the
village
of
dent
is
one
of
the
strangest
places
that
i
ever
saw
narrow
street
up
and
down
with
no
possibility
of
two
carriages
bigger
than
carts
passing
each
other
we
stopped
at
the
head
inn
and
enquired
about
the
geolog
but
he
is
not
in
the
country
we
then
called
on
his
brother
who
was
much
surprised
and
pleased
to
see
us
his
wife
came
in
soon
after
his
daughter
having
gone
with
a
party
to
see
some
waterfall
and
they
urged
us
to
stop
and
dine
with
them
so
we
walked
about
and
saw
every
place
about
the
house
church
and
school
connected
with
the
history
of
the
geolog
and
then
dined
i
promised
that
you
should
call
there
some
time
when
we
are
in
the
north
together
and
spend
a
day
or
two
with
them
mr
sedgwick
says
it
is
reported
that
whewell
will
take
sedbergh
living
which
is
now
vacant
trinity
college
is
patron
then
we
had
our
chaise
and
went
to
sedbergh
the
very
mouth
of
is
more
contracted
than
its
higher
parts
sedbergh
is
embosomed
among
lumping
hills
then
we
had
another
carriage
to
drive
to
kendal
here
is
a
recollection
of
wordsworth
salutation
ambleside
we
then
got
our
dinner
at
lowwood
and
walked
straight
to
ambleside
changed
our
shoes
and
walked
on
to
rydal
to
catch
wordsworth
at
tea
miss
wordsworth
was
being
drawn
about
in
a
chair
just
as
she
was
seven
years
ago
i
do
not
recollect
her
appearance
then
so
as
to
say
whether
she
is
much
altered
but
i
think
not
mr
wordsworth
is
as
full
of
good
talk
as
ever
and
seems
quite
strong
and
well
mrs
wordsworth
looks
older
their
son
william
was
at
tea
but
he
had
come
over
only
for
the
day
or
evening
there
was
also
a
little
girl
who
i
think
is
mrs
wordsworth
niece
in
this
year
i
commenced
a
troublesome
work
the
description
of
the
northumberland
telescope
on
i
wrote
to
the
duke
of
northumberland
suggesting
this
sending
him
a
list
of
plates
and
submitting
an
estimate
of
expense
on
i
received
the
duke
assent
i
applied
to
challis
at
the
cambridge
observatory
requesting
him
to
receive
the
draughtsman
sly
in
his
house
which
he
kindly
consented
to
do
with
regard
to
estimates
i
now
began
to
point
out
to
the
admiralty
the
inconvenience
of
furnishing
separate
estimates
viz
to
the
admiralty
for
the
astronomical
establishment
and
to
the
treasury
for
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
the
great
work
of
the
lunar
reductions
proceeded
steadily
computers
were
employed
on
with
regard
to
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
establishment
i
suppose
that
james
ross
expedition
had
returned
and
with
this
according
to
the
terms
of
the
original
grant
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
establishments
expired
there
was
much
correspondence
with
the
royal
society
and
the
treasury
and
ultimately
sir
peel
consented
to
the
continuation
of
the
establishments
to
the
end
of
in
this
year
began
my
correspondence
with
mr
mitchell
about
the
cincinnati
observatory
on
mr
mitchell
settled
himself
at
greenwich
and
worked
for
a
long
time
in
the
computing
and
in
this
year
mr
aiken
of
liverpool
first
wrote
to
me
about
the
liverpool
observatory
and
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
followed
the
plans
were
in
fact
entirely
entrusted
to
july
was
the
day
of
the
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
which
i
observed
with
my
wife
at
the
superga
near
turin
i
wrote
an
account
of
my
observations
for
the
royal
astronomical
on
i
notified
to
mr
goulburn
that
our
report
on
the
restoration
of
the
standards
was
ready
and
on
i
presented
it
after
this
followed
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
principally
concerning
the
collection
of
authenticated
copies
of
the
old
standards
from
all
in
some
discussions
with
capt
shirreff
then
captain
superintendent
of
the
chatham
dockyard
i
suggested
that
machinery
might
be
made
which
would
saw
to
their
proper
form
and
i
sent
him
some
plans
on
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
correspondence
which
lasted
long
but
which
led
to
nothing
as
will
appear
on
being
on
a
visit
to
dean
peacock
at
ely
i
examined
the
drainage
scoop
wheel
at
prickwillow
and
made
a
report
to
him
by
letter
which
obtained
circulation
and
was
well
on
may
the
manuscript
of
my
article
and
waves
for
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
was
sent
to
the
printer
i
had
extensive
correspondence
principally
on
local
tides
with
whewell
and
others
tides
were
observed
for
me
by
colby
officers
at
southampton
by
myself
at
christchurch
and
poole
at
ipswich
by
ransome
man
and
a
great
series
of
observations
of
irish
tides
were
made
on
my
plan
under
colby
direction
in
june
july
and
on
mr
goulburn
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
asked
my
opinion
on
the
utility
of
babbage
calculating
machine
and
the
propriety
of
expending
further
sums
of
money
on
it
i
replied
entering
fully
into
the
matter
and
giving
my
opinion
that
it
was
i
was
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
london
the
reduction
and
printing
of
the
astronomical
observations
had
been
getting
into
arrear
the
last
revise
of
the
observations
went
to
press
on
may
on
came
into
operation
a
new
organization
of
assistants
hours
of
attendance
required
for
bringing
up
reductions
i
worked
hard
myself
and
my
example
had
good
effect
his
reference
to
this
subject
in
his
report
to
the
visitors
is
as
follows
i
have
in
one
of
the
preceding
articles
alluded
to
the
backwardness
of
our
reductions
in
those
which
follow
it
i
trust
that
i
have
sufficiently
explained
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
loss
from
ill
health
of
the
services
of
most
efficient
assistants
i
am
certain
that
the
quantity
of
current
work
will
amply
explain
any
backwardness
perhaps
i
may
particularly
mention
that
in
the
observations
of
there
was
an
unusual
quantity
of
equatoreal
observations
and
the
reductions
attending
these
occupied
a
very
great
time
but
as
regards
myself
there
has
been
another
cause
the
reduction
of
the
ancient
lunar
and
planetary
observations
the
attention
to
chronometer
constructions
the
proposed
management
of
the
printing
of
papers
relating
to
important
operations
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
these
and
similar
operations
have
taken
up
much
of
my
time
i
trust
that
i
am
doing
well
in
rendering
greenwich
even
more
distinctly
than
it
has
been
heretofore
the
place
of
reference
to
all
the
world
for
the
important
observations
and
results
of
observations
on
which
the
system
of
the
universe
is
founded
as
regards
myself
i
have
been
accustomed
in
these
matters
to
lay
aside
private
considerations
to
consider
that
i
am
not
a
mere
superintendent
of
current
observations
but
a
trustee
for
the
honour
of
greenwich
observatory
generally
and
for
its
utility
generally
to
the
world
nay
to
consider
myself
not
as
mere
director
of
greenwich
observatory
but
however
unworthy
personally
as
british
astronomer
required
sometimes
by
my
office
to
interfere
when
no
personal
offence
is
given
in
the
concerns
of
other
establishments
of
the
state
if
the
board
supports
me
in
this
view
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
present
delay
of
computations
relating
to
current
observations
will
be
considered
by
them
as
a
very
small
sacrifice
to
the
important
advantage
that
may
be
gained
by
proper
attention
to
the
observations
of
other
times
and
other
places
of
private
history
in
february
i
went
for
a
week
to
playford
and
norwich
visiting
sedgwick
at
the
latter
place
on
mar
my
third
daughter
christabel
was
born
in
march
i
paid
a
short
visit
to
sir
john
herschel
at
hawkhurst
from
june
to
i
was
travelling
with
my
wife
on
the
continent
being
partly
occupied
with
the
observation
of
the
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
on
july
the
journey
was
in
switzerland
and
north
italy
in
december
i
went
to
cambridge
and
ely
visiting
dr
peacock
at
the
latter
place
from
to
airy
was
engaged
on
observations
of
tides
at
southampton
christchurch
poole
and
weymouth
during
this
expedition
he
wrote
frequently
as
he
always
did
to
his
wife
on
the
incidents
of
his
journey
and
the
following
letters
appear
characteristic
king
arms
christchurch
or
xchurch
the
lower
of
the
above
descriptions
of
my
present
place
of
abode
is
the
correct
one
as
i
fearlessly
assert
on
the
authority
of
divers
on
the
roads
leading
to
it
by
the
bye
this
supports
my
doctrine
that
x
in
latin
was
not
pronounced
eks
but
khi
because
the
latter
is
the
first
letter
of
christ
for
which
x
is
here
traditionally
put
finding
this
morning
that
yolland
who
called
on
me
as
soon
as
i
had
closed
the
letter
to
you
was
perfectly
inclined
to
go
on
with
the
tide
observations
at
southampton
and
that
his
corporals
of
sappers
were
conducting
them
in
the
most
exemplary
manner
i
determined
on
starting
at
once
however
we
first
went
to
look
at
the
new
docks
mud
up
to
the
knees
and
truly
it
is
a
very
great
work
there
is
to
be
enclosed
a
good
number
of
acres
of
water
feet
deep
one
dock
locked
in
the
other
a
tidal
dock
or
basin
with
that
depth
at
low
water
they
are
surrounded
by
brick
walls
eight
feet
thick
at
top
or
more
at
bottom
and
all
the
parts
that
ever
can
be
exposed
are
faced
with
granite
the
people
reckon
that
this
work
when
finished
will
attract
a
good
deal
of
the
london
commerce
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
at
it
for
it
is
very
much
easier
for
ships
to
get
into
southampton
than
into
london
and
the
railway
carriage
will
make
them
almost
one
a
very
large
steamer
is
lying
in
southampton
water
the
oriental
which
goes
to
alexandria
the
lady
mary
wood
a
large
steamer
for
lisbon
and
gibraltar
was
lying
at
the
pier
the
said
pier
is
a
very
pleasant
place
of
promenade
the
water
and
banks
are
so
pretty
and
there
is
so
much
liveliness
of
ships
about
it
well
i
started
in
a
gig
in
a
swashing
rain
which
continued
off
and
on
for
a
good
while
of
the
miles
i
should
think
that
were
across
the
new
forest
i
do
not
much
admire
it
as
for
norman
destruction
of
houses
and
churches
to
make
it
hunting
ground
that
is
utter
nonsense
which
never
could
have
been
written
by
anybody
that
ever
saw
it
but
as
to
hunting
except
his
horses
wore
something
like
or
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
it
almost
the
whole
forest
is
like
a
great
sponge
water
standing
in
every
part
in
the
part
nearer
to
xchurch
forest
trees
especially
beeches
seem
to
grow
well
we
stopped
to
bait
at
lyndhurst
a
small
place
high
up
in
the
forest
a
good
view
such
as
it
is
from
the
churchyard
the
hills
of
the
isle
of
wight
occasionally
in
sight
on
approaching
xchurch
the
chalk
cliffs
of
the
west
end
of
the
isle
of
wight
leading
to
the
needles
were
partly
visible
and
as
the
sun
was
shining
on
them
they
fairly
blazed
xchurch
is
a
small
place
with
a
church
with
lofty
clerestory
double
transept
but
with
much
irregularity
which
i
propose
to
visit
also
a
ruin
which
looks
like
an
abbey
but
the
people
call
it
a
castle
there
is
a
good
deal
of
low
land
about
it
and
the
part
between
the
town
and
the
sea
reminded
me
a
good
deal
of
the
estuary
above
cardigan
flat
bogs
generally
islands
among
the
water
i
walked
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
more
than
two
miles
passing
a
nice
little
place
called
sandford
with
a
hotel
and
a
lot
of
lodgings
for
summer
at
the
entrance
of
the
river
is
a
coastguard
station
and
this
i
find
is
the
place
to
which
i
must
go
in
the
morning
to
observe
the
tide
i
had
some
talk
with
the
coastguard
people
and
they
assure
me
that
the
tide
is
really
double
as
reported
as
i
came
away
the
great
full
moon
was
rising
and
i
could
read
in
her
unusually
broad
face
indicating
her
nearness
to
the
earth
that
there
will
be
a
powerful
tide
i
came
in
and
have
had
dinner
and
tea
and
am
now
going
to
bed
endeavouring
to
negociate
for
a
breakfast
at
six
morning
it
is
raining
cats
and
dogs
luce
hotel
weymouth
this
morning
when
i
got
up
i
found
that
it
was
blowing
fresh
from
and
the
sea
was
bursting
over
the
wall
of
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
esplanade
very
magnanimously
so
the
swell
not
being
favourable
for
i
gave
them
up
and
determined
to
go
to
see
the
surf
on
the
chesil
bank
i
started
with
my
on
more
for
defence
against
the
wind
than
against
rain
but
in
a
short
time
it
began
to
rain
and
just
when
i
was
approaching
the
bridge
which
connects
the
mainland
with
the
point
where
the
chesil
bank
ends
at
portland
there
being
an
arm
of
the
sea
behind
the
chesil
bank
it
rained
and
blew
most
dreadfully
however
i
kept
on
and
mounted
the
bank
and
descended
a
little
way
towards
the
sea
and
there
was
the
surf
in
all
its
glory
i
can
not
give
you
an
idea
of
its
majestic
appearance
it
was
evidently
very
high
but
that
was
not
the
most
striking
part
of
it
for
there
was
no
such
thing
as
going
within
a
considerable
distance
of
it
the
occasional
outbreaks
of
the
water
advancing
so
far
so
that
its
magnitude
could
not
be
well
seen
my
impression
is
that
the
height
of
the
surf
was
from
to
feet
but
the
striking
part
was
the
clouds
of
solid
spray
which
formed
immediately
and
which
completely
concealed
all
the
other
operations
of
the
water
they
rose
a
good
deal
higher
than
the
top
of
the
surf
so
the
state
of
things
was
this
a
great
swell
is
seen
coming
growing
steeper
and
steeper
then
it
all
turns
over
and
you
see
a
face
just
like
the
pictures
of
falls
of
niagara
but
in
a
little
more
than
one
second
this
is
totally
lost
and
there
is
nothing
before
you
but
an
enormous
impenetrable
cloud
of
white
spray
in
about
another
second
there
comes
from
the
bottom
of
this
cloud
the
foaming
current
of
water
up
the
bank
and
it
returns
grating
the
pebbles
together
till
their
jar
penetrates
the
very
brain
i
stood
in
the
face
of
the
wind
and
rain
watching
this
a
good
while
and
should
have
stood
longer
but
that
i
was
so
miserably
wet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
surf
was
higher
farther
along
the
bank
but
the
air
was
so
thickened
by
the
rain
and
the
spray
that
i
could
not
tell
when
i
returned
the
bad
weather
abated
i
have
now
borrowed
somebody
else
trowsers
while
mine
are
drying
having
got
little
wet
in
other
parts
thanks
to
my
which
successfully
brought
home
a
hundredweight
of
water
and
do
not
intend
to
stir
out
again
except
perhaps
to
post
this
letter
flamsteed
house
may
yesterday
after
posting
the
letter
for
you
i
went
per
steamboat
to
hungerford
i
then
found
mr
vignoles
and
we
trundled
off
together
with
another
engineer
named
smith
picking
up
stratford
by
the
way
to
wormwood
scrubs
there
was
a
party
to
see
the
atmospheric
railway
in
action
including
among
others
sir
john
burgoyne
whom
i
met
in
ireland
several
years
ago
and
mr
pym
the
engineer
of
the
dublin
and
kingstown
railway
whom
i
have
seen
several
times
and
who
is
very
sanguine
about
this
construction
and
mr
clegg
the
proposer
of
the
scheme
the
man
that
invented
gas
in
its
present
arrangements
and
messrs
samuda
two
jews
who
are
the
owners
of
the
experiment
now
going
on
and
sir
james
south
with
the
latter
hero
and
mechanician
we
did
not
come
in
contact
unfortunately
the
stationary
engine
for
working
the
which
draws
the
air
out
of
the
pipes
and
thus
sucks
the
carriages
along
broke
down
during
the
experiment
but
not
till
we
had
seen
the
carriage
have
one
right
good
run
and
to
be
sure
it
is
very
funny
to
see
a
carriage
running
all
alone
as
if
the
devil
drove
it
without
any
visible
cause
whatever
the
mechanical
arrangements
we
were
able
to
examine
as
well
after
the
engine
had
broken
down
as
at
any
time
and
they
are
very
simple
and
apparently
very
satisfactory
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
mechanical
practicability
of
the
thing
even
in
places
where
locomotives
can
hardly
be
used
whether
it
will
pay
or
not
is
doubtful
i
dare
say
that
the
commissioners
report
has
taken
a
very
good
line
of
discrimination
in
march
i
wrote
to
dr
wynter
at
oxford
requesting
permission
to
see
bradley
and
bliss
manuscript
observations
with
the
view
of
taking
a
copy
of
them
this
was
granted
and
the
books
of
transits
were
subsequently
copied
under
mr
breen
superintendence
the
following
paragraph
is
extracted
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
the
report
of
last
year
i
stated
that
our
reductions
had
dropped
considerably
in
arrear
i
have
the
satisfaction
now
of
stating
that
this
arrear
and
very
much
more
have
been
completely
recovered
and
that
the
reductions
are
now
in
as
forward
a
state
as
at
any
time
since
my
connection
with
the
observatory
in
fact
the
observations
of
were
sent
to
press
on
mar
about
this
year
the
annual
dinner
at
the
visitation
began
to
be
more
important
principally
under
the
management
of
capt
smyth
in
november
i
was
enquiring
about
an
i
had
already
in
mind
the
furnishing
of
our
meridional
instruments
with
greater
optical
on
july
the
admiralty
referred
to
me
a
memorial
of
mr
ulrich
a
chronometer
maker
claiming
a
reward
for
improvements
in
chronometers
i
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
the
investigation
of
this
matter
by
books
witnesses
and
finally
reported
on
that
there
was
no
ground
for
in
april
i
received
the
first
application
of
the
royal
exchange
committee
for
assistance
in
the
construction
of
the
clock
this
led
to
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
especially
with
the
lunar
reductions
were
going
on
in
full
i
had
much
work
in
connection
with
the
cape
observatory
partly
about
an
equatoreal
required
for
the
observatory
but
chiefly
in
getting
maclear
work
through
the
in
this
year
i
began
to
think
seriously
of
determining
the
longitude
of
valencia
in
ireland
as
a
most
important
basis
for
the
scale
of
longitude
in
these
latitudes
by
the
transmission
of
chronometers
and
in
august
i
went
to
valencia
and
examined
the
localities
in
september
i
submitted
a
plan
to
the
admiralty
but
it
was
the
new
commission
for
restoring
the
standards
was
appointed
on
june
i
being
chairman
the
work
of
collecting
standards
and
arranging
plans
was
going
on
mr
baily
attending
to
standards
of
length
and
miller
to
standards
of
weight
we
held
two
a
small
assistance
was
rendered
to
me
by
mr
charles
may
of
the
firm
of
ransomes
and
may
which
has
contributed
much
to
the
good
order
of
papers
in
the
observatory
mr
robert
ransome
had
remarked
my
method
of
punching
holes
in
the
paper
by
a
the
places
of
the
holes
being
guided
by
holes
in
a
piece
of
card
and
said
that
they
could
furnish
me
with
something
better
accordingly
on
mr
may
sent
me
the
punching
machine
the
prototype
of
all
now
used
in
the
observatory
on
was
made
my
proposal
for
an
altazimuth
instrument
for
making
observations
of
the
moon
place
more
frequently
and
through
parts
of
her
orbit
where
she
could
never
be
observed
with
meridional
instruments
the
most
important
addition
to
the
observatory
since
its
foundation
the
board
of
visitors
recommended
it
to
the
admiralty
and
the
admiralty
sanctioned
the
construction
of
the
instrument
and
the
building
to
contain
it
the
following
passage
is
quoted
from
the
address
of
the
astronomer
royal
to
the
board
of
visitors
at
the
special
meeting
of
the
most
important
object
in
the
institution
and
maintenance
of
the
royal
observatory
has
always
been
the
observations
of
the
moon
in
this
term
i
include
the
determination
of
the
places
of
fixed
stars
which
are
necessary
for
ascertaining
the
instrumental
errors
applicable
to
the
instrumental
observations
of
the
moon
these
as
regards
the
objects
of
the
institution
were
merely
auxiliaries
the
history
of
the
circumstances
which
led
the
government
of
the
day
to
supply
the
funds
for
the
construction
of
the
observatory
shews
that
but
for
the
demands
of
accurate
lunar
determinations
as
aids
to
navigation
the
erection
of
a
national
observatory
would
never
have
been
thought
of
and
this
object
has
been
steadily
kept
in
view
when
others
necessary
as
fundamental
auxiliaries
were
passed
by
thus
during
the
latter
part
of
bradley
time
and
bliss
time
which
two
periods
are
the
least
efficient
in
the
modern
history
of
the
observatory
and
during
the
latter
part
of
maskelyne
presidency
when
for
years
together
there
is
scarcely
a
single
observation
of
the
declination
of
a
star
the
observations
of
the
moon
were
kept
up
with
the
utmost
regularity
and
the
effect
of
this
regularity
as
regards
its
peculiar
object
has
been
most
honourable
to
the
institution
the
existing
theories
and
tables
of
the
moon
are
founded
entirely
upon
the
greenwich
observations
the
observatory
of
greenwich
has
been
looked
to
as
that
from
which
alone
adequate
observations
can
be
expected
and
from
which
they
will
not
be
expected
in
vain
and
it
is
not
perhaps
venturing
too
much
to
predict
that
unless
some
gross
dereliction
of
duty
by
the
managers
of
the
observatory
should
occur
the
lunar
tables
will
always
be
founded
on
greenwich
observations
with
this
impression
it
has
long
been
to
me
a
matter
of
consideration
whether
means
should
not
be
taken
for
rendering
the
series
of
observations
of
the
moon
more
complete
than
it
can
be
made
by
the
means
at
present
recognized
in
our
observatories
in
illustration
of
the
foregoing
remarks
the
original
inscription
still
remaining
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
of
the
octagon
room
of
the
observatory
may
be
quoted
it
runs
thus

the
ashburton
treaty
had
been
settled
with
the
united
states
for
the
boundary
between
canada
and
the
state
of
maine
and
one
of
its
conditions
was
that
a
straight
line
about
miles
in
length
should
be
drawn
through
dense
woods
connecting
definite
points
it
soon
appeared
that
this
could
scarcely
be
done
except
by
astronomical
operations
lord
canning
under
secretary
of
the
foreign
office
requested
me
to
nominate
two
astronomers
to
undertake
the
work
i
strongly
recommended
that
military
officers
should
carry
out
the
work
and
capt
robinson
and
lieut
pipon
were
detached
for
this
service
on
mar
they
took
lodgings
at
greenwich
and
worked
at
the
observatory
every
day
and
night
through
the
month
my
detailed
astronomical
instructions
to
them
were
drawn
out
on
mar
i
prepared
all
the
necessary
skeleton
forms
and
looked
to
their
scientific
equipment
in
every
way
the
result
will
be
given
in
of
private
history
in
january
i
went
to
dover
with
my
wife
to
see
the
blasting
of
a
cliff
there
we
also
visited
sir
herschel
at
hawkhurst
in
april
i
was
at
playford
on
a
visit
to
arthur
biddell
on
apr
my
daughter
annot
was
born
from
july
to
august
i
was
travelling
in
the
south
of
ireland
chiefly
to
see
valencia
and
consider
the
question
of
determining
its
longitude
during
this
journey
i
visited
lord
rosse
at
birr
castle
and
returned
to
weymouth
where
my
family
were
staying
at
the
time
in
october
i
visited
cambridge
and
in
december
i
was
again
at
playford
the
journey
to
cambridge
to
was
apparently
in
order
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
of
the
queen
visit
there
on
the
the
following
letter
relating
to
it
was
written
to
his
wife
sedgwick
rooms
trinity
college
cambridge
i
have
this
morning
received
your
letter
i
had
no
time
to
write
yesterday
there
are
more
things
to
tell
of
than
i
can
possibly
remember
the
dean
of
ely
yesterday
was
in
a
most
ludicrous
state
of
misery
because
his
servant
had
sent
his
portmanteau
containing
his
scarlet
academicals
as
well
as
everything
else
to
london
and
it
went
to
watford
before
it
was
recovered
but
he
got
it
in
time
to
shew
himself
yesterday
morning
i
came
early
to
breakfast
with
sedgwick
then
i
walked
about
the
streets
to
look
at
the
flags
cambridge
never
had
such
an
appearance
before
in
looking
along
trinity
street
or
trumpington
street
there
were
arches
and
flags
as
close
as
they
could
stand
and
a
cord
stretched
from
king
entrance
to
mr
deck
or
the
next
house
with
flags
on
all
its
length
a
flag
on
st
mary
and
a
huge
royal
standard
ready
to
hoist
on
trinity
gateway
laurels
without
end
i
applied
at
the
registrar
office
for
a
ticket
which
was
to
admit
me
to
trinity
court
the
senate
house
and
received
from
peacock
one
for
king
chapel
then
there
was
an
infinity
of
standing
about
and
very
much
i
was
fatigued
till
i
got
some
luncheon
at
blakesley
rooms
at
this
was
necessary
because
there
was
to
be
no
dinner
in
hall
on
account
of
the
address
presentation
the
queen
was
expected
at
and
arrived
about
minutes
after
when
she
drove
up
to
trinity
gate
the
masters
and
beadles
went
to
meet
her
and
the
beadles
laid
down
their
staves
which
she
desired
them
to
take
again
then
she
came
towards
the
lodge
as
far
as
the
sundial
where
whewell
as
master
took
the
college
keys
a
bundle
of
rusty
keys
tied
together
by
a
particularly
greasy
strap
from
the
bursar
martin
and
handed
them
to
the
queen
who
returned
them
then
she
drove
round
by
the
of
the
court
to
the
lodge
door
almost
every
member
of
the
university
was
in
the
court
and
there
was
a
great
hurraing
except
when
the
ceremonies
were
going
forward
presently
the
queen
appeared
at
a
window
and
bowed
and
was
loudly
cheered
then
notice
was
given
that
the
queen
and
prince
would
receive
the
addresses
of
the
university
in
trinity
hall
and
a
procession
was
formed
in
which
i
had
a
good
place
as
i
claimed
rank
with
the
professors
a
throne
and
canopy
were
erected
at
the
top
of
the
hall
but
the
queen
did
not
sit
which
was
her
own
determination
because
if
she
had
sat
it
would
have
been
proper
that
everybody
should
back
out
before
presenting
the
address
to
the
prince
which
operation
would
have
suffocated
at
least
people
the
queen
wore
a
blue
gown
and
a
brown
shawl
with
an
immense
quantity
of
gold
embroidery
and
a
bonnet
then
it
was
known
that
the
queen
was
going
to
service
at
king
chapel
at
half
past
three
so
everybody
went
there
i
saw
the
queen
walk
up
the
antechapel
and
she
looked
at
nothing
but
the
roof
i
was
not
able
to
see
her
in
chapel
or
to
see
the
throne
erected
for
her
with
its
back
to
the
table
which
has
given
great
offence
to
many
people
i
should
have
said
that
before
the
queen
came
i
called
on
dr
haviland
also
on
scholefield
also
on
the
master
of
christ
after
this
she
returned
to
trinity
and
took
into
her
head
to
look
at
the
chapel
the
cloth
laid
on
the
pavement
was
not
long
enough
and
the
undergraduates
laid
down
their
gowns
several
of
the
undergraduate
noblemen
carried
candles
to
illuminate
newton
statue
after
this
the
prince
went
by
torchlight
to
the
library
then
i
suppose
came
dinner
and
then
it
was
made
known
that
at
nine
the
queen
would
receive
some
members
of
the
university
so
i
rigged
myself
up
and
went
to
the
levée
at
the
lodge
and
was
presented
in
my
turn
by
the
as
airy
your
majesty
astronomer
royal
the
queen
and
the
prince
stood
together
and
a
bow
was
made
to
and
received
from
each
the
prince
recognised
me
and
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
or
something
like
that
next
to
him
stood
goulburn
and
next
lord
lyndhurst
who
to
my
great
surprise
spoke
very
civilly
to
me
as
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
the
queen
had
her
head
bare
and
a
sort
of
french
white
gown
and
looked
very
well
she
had
the
ribbon
of
the
garter
on
her
breast
but
like
a
ninny
i
forgot
to
look
whether
she
had
the
garter
upon
her
arm
the
prince
wore
his
garter
i
went
to
bed
dead
tired
and
got
up
with
a
about
the
degree
to
the
prince
and
the
other
movements
i
will
write
again
here
is
a
note
from
cubitt
relating
to
the
blasting
of
the
round
down
cliff
at
dover
referred
to
above
great
george
street
my
dear
sir
next
the
at
is
the
time
fixed
for
the
attempt
to
blow
out
the
foot
of
the
round
down
cliff
near
dover
the
galvanic
apparatus
has
been
repeatedly
tried
in
place
that
is
by
exploding
cartridges
in
the
very
chambers
of
the
rock
prepared
for
the
powder
with
the
batteries
at
feet
distance
they
are
in
full
form
and
act
admirably
so
that
i
see
but
little
fear
of
failure
on
that
head
they
have
been
rehearsing
the
explosions
on
the
plan
i
most
strongly
recommended
that
is
to
fire
each
chamber
by
an
independent
battery
and
circuit
and
to
discharge
the
three
batteries
simultaneously
by
signal
or
word
of
command
which
answers
well
and
no
mistake
i
shall
write
to
sir
john
herschel
and
remain
my
dear
sir
very
truly

the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
to
his
wife
written
in
ireland
when
on
his
journey
to
consider
the
determination
of
the
longitude
of
valencia
skibbereen
july
by
the
bye
to
shew
the
quiet
of
ireland
now
i
saw
in
a
newspaper
at
cork
this
account
at
some
place
through
which
a
was
to
pass
i
forget
its
name
the
repealers
of
the
place
set
up
a
triumphal
arch
the
police
pulled
it
down
and
were
pelted
by
the
repealers
and
one
of
the
policemen
was
much
bruised
has
denounced
this
place
as
a
disgrace
to
the
cause
of
repeal
and
has
moved
in
the
full
meeting
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
be
struck
off
the
repeal
list
with
no
exception
but
that
of
the
parish
priest
who
was
proved
to
be
absent
and
declares
that
he
will
not
pass
through
this
place
now
for
my
journey
it
is
a
sort
of
country
all
the
way
with
some
bogs
to
refresh
my
eyes
valencia
hotel
august
it
seems
that
my
coming
here
has
caused
infinite
alarm
the
common
people
do
not
know
what
to
conjecture
but
have
some
notion
that
the
sappers
and
miners
are
to
build
a
bridge
to
admit
the
charge
of
cavalry
into
the
island
an
attendant
of
mrs
fitzgerald
expressed
how
strange
it
was
that
a
man
looking
so
mild
and
gentle
could
meditate
such
things
but
never
fear
maam
those
that
look
so
mild
are
always
the
worst
then
she
narrated
how
that
her
husband
was
building
some
stables
but
that
she
was
demanding
of
him
pat
you
broth
of
a
boy
what
is
the
use
of
your
building
stables
when
these
people
are
coming
to
destroy
everything
i
suspect
that
the
people
who
saw
me
walking
up
through
the
storm
yesterday
must
have
thought
me
the
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
at
least
hibernian
hotel
tralee
august
i
sailed
from
valencia
to
cahersiveen
town
in
a
up
the
water
not
crossing
at
the
ferry
i
had
accommodated
my
time
to
the
wish
of
the
boatman
who
desired
to
be
there
in
time
for
prayers
so
that
i
had
a
long
waiting
at
cahersiveen
for
the
mail
car
in
walking
through
the
little
town
i
passed
the
chapel
a
convent
chapel
to
which
the
people
were
going
and
really
the
scene
was
very
curious
the
chapel
appeared
to
be
overflowing
full
and
the
court
in
front
of
it
was
full
of
people
some
sitting
on
the
ground
some
kneeling
and
some
prostrate
there
were
also
people
in
the
street
kneeling
with
their
faces
towards
the
gate
pillars
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
priest
and
the
chapel
were
of
less
use
here
than
even
in
the
continental
churches
and
i
do
not
see
why
both
parties
should
not
have
stopped
at
home
when
the
chapel
broke
up
it
seemed
as
if
the
streets
were
crammed
with
people
the
turnout
that
even
a
small
village
in
ireland
produces
is
perfectly
amazing
in
the
course
of
i
had
put
in
hand
the
engraving
of
the
drawings
of
the
northumberland
telescope
at
cambridge
observatory
and
wrote
the
description
for
letterpress
in
the
course
of
the
work
was
completed
and
the
books
were
bound
and
distributed
the
building
to
receive
the
altazimuth
instrument
was
erected
in
the
course
of
the
year
during
the
construction
a
foreman
fell
into
the
foundation
pit
and
broke
his
leg
of
which
accident
he
died
this
is
the
only
accident
that
i
have
known
at
the
the
electrometer
mast
and
sliding
frame
were
erected
near
the
magnetic
the
catalogue
of
stars
was
finished
this
work
had
been
in
progress
during
the
last
few
in
may
i
went
to
woolwich
to
correct
the
compasses
of
the
a
small
iron
steamer
carrying
mails
between
dover
and
ostend
this
i
believe
was
the
first
iron
ship
possessed
by
the
the
lunar
reductions
were
making
good
progress
computers
were
employed
upon
them
i
made
application
for
printing
them
and
the
required
sum
was
granted
by
the
in
this
year
commenced
that
remarkable
movement
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
neptune
on
challis
introduced
mr
adams
to
me
by
letter
on
i
sent
my
observed
places
of
uranus
which
were
wanted
on
june
i
also
sent
places
to
mr
e
as
regards
the
national
standards
mr
baily
who
undertook
the
comparisons
relating
to
standards
of
length
died
soon
and
mr
sheepshanks
then
undertook
the
i
attended
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
held
at
york
principally
in
compliment
to
the
president
dr
peacock
and
gave
an
oral
account
of
my
work
on
irish
at
the
oxford
commemoration
in
june
the
honorary
degree
of
was
conferred
on
struve
and
on
me
and
then
a
demand
was
made
on
each
of
us
for
for
fees
we
were
much
disgusted
and
refused
to
pay
it
and
i
wrote
angrily
to
dr
wynter
the
the
fees
were
ultimately
paid
out
of
the
university
chest
in
this
year
the
longitude
of
altona
was
determined
by
struve
for
the
russian
government
for
this
purpose
it
was
essential
that
facilities
should
be
given
for
landing
chronometers
at
greenwich
but
the
consent
of
the
customhouse
authorities
had
first
to
be
obtained
and
this
required
a
good
deal
of
negotiation
ultimately
the
determination
was
completed
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
the
chronometers
in
number
crossed
the
german
sea
sixteen
times
the
transit
observers
were
twice
interchanged
in
order
to
eliminate
not
only
their
personal
equation
but
also
the
gradual
change
of
personal
equation
on
otto
struve
formally
wrote
his
thanks
for
assistance
rendered
for
the
determination
of
the
longitude
of
valencia
which
was
carried
out
in
this
year
various
methods
were
discussed
but
the
plan
of
sending
chronometers
by
mail
conveyance
was
finally
approved
from
london
to
liverpool
the
chronometers
were
conveyed
by
the
railways
from
liverpool
to
kingstown
by
steamer
from
dublin
to
tralee
by
the
mail
coaches
from
tralee
to
cahersiveen
by
car
from
cahersiveen
to
knightstown
by
boat
and
from
knightstown
to
the
station
on
the
hill
the
box
was
carried
like
a
there
were
numerous
other
arrangements
and
all
succeeded
perfectly
without
a
failure
of
any
kind
thirty
pocket
chronometers
traversed
the
line
between
greenwich
and
kingstown
about
times
and
that
between
kingstown
and
valencia
twenty
times
the
chronometrical
longitudes
of
liverpool
observatory
kingstown
station
and
valencia
station
are
the
geodetic
longitudes
computed
from
elements
which
i
published
long
ago
in
the
encyclopaedia
metropolitana
are
it
appears
from
this
that
the
elements
to
which
i
have
alluded
represent
the
form
of
the
earth
here
as
nearly
as
is
possible
on
the
whole
i
think
it
probable
that
this
is
the
best
arc
of
parallel
that
has
ever
been
measured
with
regard
to
the
maine
boundary
on
may
estcourt
the
british
commissioner
wrote
to
me
describing
the
perfect
success
of
following
out
my
plan
the
line
of
miles
was
cut
by
directions
laid
out
at
the
two
ends
and
the
cuttings
met
within
feet
the
country
through
which
this
line
was
to
pass
is
described
as
surpassing
in
its
difficulties
the
conception
of
any
european
it
consists
of
impervious
forests
steep
ravines
and
dismal
swamps
a
survey
for
the
line
was
impossible
and
a
tentative
process
would
have
broken
the
spirit
of
the
best
men
i
therefore
arranged
a
plan
of
operations
founded
on
a
determination
of
the
absolute
latitudes
and
the
difference
of
longitudes
of
the
two
extremities
the
difference
of
longitudes
was
determined
by
the
transfer
of
chronometers
by
the
very
circuitous
route
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
and
it
was
necessary
to
divide
the
whole
arc
into
four
parts
and
to
add
a
small
part
by
measure
and
bearing
when
this
was
finished
the
azimuths
of
the
line
for
the
two
ends
were
computed
and
marks
were
laid
off
for
starting
with
the
line
from
both
ends
one
party
after
cutting
more
than
miles
through
the
woods
were
agreeably
surprised
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
at
seeing
directly
before
them
a
gap
in
the
woods
on
the
next
line
of
hill
it
opened
gradually
and
proved
to
be
the
line
of
the
opposite
party
on
continuing
the
lines
till
they
passed
abreast
of
each
other
their
distance
was
found
to
be
feet
to
form
an
estimate
of
the
magnitude
of
this
error
it
is
to
be
observed
that
it
implies
an
error
of
only
a
quarter
of
a
second
of
time
in
the
difference
of
longitudes
and
that
it
is
only
or
nearly
so
of
the
error
which
would
have
been
committed
if
the
spheroidal
form
of
the
earth
had
been
neglected
i
must
point
out
the
extraordinary
merit
of
the
officers
who
effected
this
operation
transits
were
observed
and
chronometers
were
interchanged
when
the
temperature
was
lower
than
below
zero
and
when
the
native
assistants
though
paid
highly
deserted
on
account
of
the
severity
of
the
weather
the
british
officers
still
continued
the
observations
upon
whose
delicacy
everything
depended
of
private
history
from
july
to
i
was
in
ireland
with
my
wife
this
was
partly
a
business
journey
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
the
longitude
of
valencia
on
i
asked
lord
lyndhurst
lord
chancellor
to
present
my
brother
to
the
living
of
helmingham
which
he
declined
to
do
but
on
he
offered
binbrooke
which
i
accepted
for
my
brother
a
map
of
the
buildings
and
grounds
of
the
observatory
was
commenced
in
and
was
still
in
on
mar
i
was
employed
on
a
matter
which
had
for
some
time
occupied
my
thoughts
the
of
current
manuscripts
i
had
prepared
a
sloping
box
still
in
use
to
hold
portfolios
and
at
this
time
i
arranged
papers
a
and
went
on
with
b
c
very
little
change
has
been
made
in
in
reference
to
the
time
given
to
the
weekly
report
on
meteorology
to
the
registrar
general
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
contains
the
following
paragraph
devotion
of
some
of
my
assistants
time
and
labour
to
the
preparation
of
the
meteorological
report
attached
to
the
weekly
report
of
the
registrar
general
is
in
my
opinion
justified
by
the
bearing
of
the
meteorological
facts
upon
the
medical
facts
and
by
the
attention
which
i
understand
that
report
to
have
excited
on
the
sleep
of
astronomy
was
broken
by
the
announcement
that
a
new
planet
astraea
was
discovered
by
mr
hencke
i
immediately
circulated
but
in
this
year
began
a
more
remarkable
planetary
discussion
on
challis
wrote
to
me
to
say
that
mr
adams
would
leave
with
me
his
results
on
the
explanation
of
the
irregularities
of
uranus
by
the
action
of
an
exterior
planet
in
october
adams
called
in
my
absence
on
i
wrote
to
him
enquiring
whether
his
theory
explained
the
irregularity
of
as
well
as
that
of
longitude
i
waited
for
an
answer
but
received
none
see
the
papers
printed
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
memoirs
and
monthly
notices
in
the
royal
society
the
royal
medal
was
awarded
to
me
for
my
paper
on
the
irish
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
i
was
president
and
with
a
speech
delivered
the
medal
to
capt
smyth
for
the

catalogue
of
double

i
was
appointed
with

of

under
his
sign
the
tidal
harbour
commission
commenced
on
apr
on
july
my
report
on
wexford
harbour
in
which
i
think
i
introduced
important
principles
was
communicated
one
report
was
made
this
year
to
the
in
the
matter
of
saw
mills
which
had
begun
in
i
had
prepared
a
second
set
of
plans
in
and
in
this
year
mr
nasmyth
made
a
very
favourable
report
on
my
plan
a
machinist
of
the
chatham
dock
yard
sylvester
was
set
to
work
but
not
under
my
immediate
command
to
make
a
model
and
this
produced
so
much
delay
as
ultimately
to
ruin
the
on
i
was
engaged
on
my
paper
the
flexure
of
a
uniform
bar
supported
by
equal
pressures
at
equidistant
points
this
was
probably
in
connection
with
the
support
of
standards
of
length
for
the
commission
ed
in
june
i
attended
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
cambridge
and
on
the
i
gave
a
lecture
on
magnetism
in
the
senate
house
the
following
quotation
relating
to
this
lecture
is
taken
from
a
letter
by
whewell
to
his
wife
see
life
of
william
whewell
by
mrs
stair
douglas
i
did
not
go
to
the
senate
house
yesterday
evening
airy
was
the
performer
and
appears
to
have
outdone
himself
in
his
art
of
giving
clearness
and
simplicity
to
the
hardest
and
most
complex
subjects
he
kept
the
attention
of
his
audience
quite
enchained
for
above
two
hours
talking
about
terrestrial
magnetism
on
i
gave
evidence
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
on
dover
harbour
pier
with
respect
to
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
establishment
the
transactions
in
this
year
were
most
important
it
had
been
understood
that
the
government
establishments
had
been
sanctioned
twice
for
periods
of
which
the
second
would
expire
at
the
end
of
and
it
was
a
question
with
the
scientific
public
whether
they
should
be
continued
my
own
opinion
was
in
favour
of
stopping
the
observations
and
carefully
discussing
them
and
i
am
convinced
that
this
would
have
been
best
except
for
the
subsequent
introduction
of
systems
in
which
i
had
so
large
a
share
there
was
much
discussion
and
correspondence
and
on
june
the
board
of
visitors
resolved
that
the
opinion
of
the
visitors
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
these
observations
should
continue
to
be
made
on
the
most
extensive
scale
which
the
interests
of
those
sciences
may
require
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
was
held
at
cambridge
in
june
and
one
of
the
most
important
matters
there
was
the
congress
of
magnetic
philosophers
many
of
them
foreigners
it
was
resolved
that
the
magnetic
observatory
at
greenwich
be
continued
permanently
at
this
meeting
i
proposed
a
resolution
which
has
proved
to
be
exceedingly
important
i
had
remarked
the
distress
which
the
continuous
observations
through
the
night
produced
to
my
assistants
and
determined
if
possible
to
remove
it
i
therefore
proposed
it
is
highly
desirable
to
encourage
by
specific
pecuniary
reward
the
improvement
of
magnetical
and
meteorological
apparatus
and
that
the
president
of
the
british
association
and
the
president
of
the
royal
society
be
requested
to
solicit
the
favourable
consideration
of
her
majesty
government
to
this
subject
which
was
adopted
in
october
the
admiralty
expressed
their
willingness
to
grant
a
reward
up
to
mr
charles
brooke
had
written
to
me
proposing
a
plan
on
and
he
sent
me
his
first
register
on
on
the
treasury
informed
the
admiralty
that
the
magnetic
observatories
will
be
continued
for
a
further
period
the
railway
gauge
commission
in
this
year
was
an
important
employment
the
railways
which
had
begun
with
the
manchester
and
liverpool
railway
followed
by
the
london
and
birmingham
had
advanced
over
the
country
with
some
variation
in
their
breadth
of
gauge
the
gauge
of
the
colchester
railway
had
been
altered
to
suit
that
of
the
cambridge
railway
and
finally
there
remained
but
two
gauges
the
broad
gauge
principally
in
the
system
allied
with
the
great
western
railway
and
the
narrow
gauge
through
the
rest
of
england
these
came
in
contact
at
gloucester
and
were
likely
to
come
in
contact
at
many
other
points
to
the
enormous
inconvenience
of
the
public
the
government
determined
to
interfere
beginning
with
a
commission
on
july
mr
laing
then
on
the
board
of
trade
rode
to
greenwich
bearing
a
letter
of
introduction
from
sir
john
lefevre
and
a
request
from
lord
dalhousie
president
of
the
board
of
trade
that
i
would
act
as
second
of
a
royal
commission
sir
frederick
smith
airy
barlow
i
assented
to
this
and
very
soon
began
a
vigorous
course
of
business
on
july
and
i
went
with
barlow
and
our
secretary
to
bristol
gloucester
and
birmingham
on
i
went
on
railway
experiments
to
didcot
and
on
to
i
went
to
york
with
barlow
and
george
arthur
biddell
for
railway
experiments
on
i
finished
a
draft
report
of
the
railway
gauge
commission
which
served
in
great
measure
as
a
basis
for
that
adopted
next
year
of
private
history
i
wrote
to
lord
lyndhurst
on
requesting
an
exchange
of
the
living
to
which
he
had
presented
my
brother
in
for
that
of
swineshead
to
which
he
on
i
went
with
my
wife
on
a
visit
to
my
uncle
george
biddell
at
bradfield
st
george
near
on
june
i
went
into
the
mining
district
of
cornwall
with
george
arthur
from
to
i
was
travelling
in
france
with
my
sister
and
my
wife
sister
georgiana
smith
i
was
well
introduced
and
the
journey
was
on
my
son
osmund
was
mr
baily
bequeathed
to
me
which
realized
here
are
some
extracts
from
letters
written
to
his
wife
relating
to
the
visit
to
the
cornish
mines
pearce
hotel
falmouth
june
then
we
walked
to
the
united
mines
in
gwennap
the
day
was
very
fine
and
now
it
was
perfectly
broiling
and
the
hills
here
are
long
and
steep
at
the
united
mines
we
found
the
captain
and
he
invited
us
to
join
in
a
rough
dinner
to
which
he
and
the
other
captains
were
going
to
sit
down
then
we
examined
one
of
the
great
pumping
engines
which
is
considered
the
best
in
the
country
and
some
other
engines
between
and
there
was
to
be
a
setting
out
of
some
work
to
the
men
by
a
sort
of
dutch
auction
the
usual
way
of
setting
out
the
work
here
some
refuse
ores
were
to
be
broken
up
and
made
marketable
and
the
subject
of
competition
was
for
how
little
in
the
pound
on
the
gross
produce
the
men
would
work
them
up
while
we
were
here
a
man
was
brought
up
who
was
hurt
in
blasting
a
piece
of
rock
had
fallen
on
him
at
this
mine
besides
the
ladder
ways
they
have
buckets
sliding
in
guides
by
which
the
men
are
brought
up
and
they
are
just
preparing
for
work
another
apparatus
which
they
say
is
tried
successfully
at
another
mine
tresavean
there
are
two
wooden
rods
and
reaching
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
moved
by
cranks
from
the
same
wheel
so
that
one
goes
up
when
the
other
goes
down
and
vice
versâ
each
of
these
rods
has
small
stages
at
such
a
distance
that
when
the
rod
is
down
and
the
rod
is
up
the
first
stage
of
is
level
with
the
first
stage
of
but
when
the
rod
is
up
and
the
rod
is
down
the
second
stage
of
is
level
with
the
first
stage
of
so
a
man
who
wants
to
descend
steps
on
the
first
stage
of
and
waits
till
it
goes
down
then
he
steps
sideways
on
the
first
stage
of
and
waits
till
it
goes
down
then
he
steps
sideways
to
the
second
stage
of
and
waits
till
it
goes
down
and
so
on
or
if
a
man
is
coming
up
he
does
just
the
same
while
we
were
here
mr
taylor
came
we
walked
home
a
long
step
perhaps
seven
miles
in
a
very
hot
sun
went
to
tea
to
mr
alfred
fox
who
has
a
house
in
a
beautiful
position
looking
to
the
outside
of
falmouth
harbour
penzance
june
yesterday
morning
we
breakfasted
early
at
falmouth
and
before
started
towards
gwennap
i
had
ascertained
on
thursday
that
john
williams
the
senior
of
a
very
wealthy
and
influential
family
in
this
country
was
probably
returned
from
london
so
we
drove
first
to
his
house
burntcoose
or
barncoose
and
found
him
and
his
wife
at
home
they
are
quakers
the
rest
of
the
family
are
not
sedgwick
and
whewell
and
i
or
some
of
our
party
including
me
had
slept
once
at
their
house
they
received
george
and
me
most
cordially
and
pressed
us
to
come
and
dine
with
them
after
our
visit
to
tresavean
mine
of
which
intention
i
spoke
in
my
last
letter
so
i
named
as
hour
for
dinner
after
a
little
stay
we
drove
to
tresavean
where
i
found
the
captain
of
the
mine
prepared
to
send
an
underground
captain
and
a
to
descend
with
us
so
we
changed
our
clothes
and
descended
by
the
ladders
in
the
pumpshaft
pretty
work
to
descend
with
the
huge
garnished
with
large
iron
bolts
working
violently
making
strokes
of
feet
close
to
our
elbows
and
with
a
nearly
bottomless
pit
at
the
foot
of
every
ladder
where
we
had
to
turn
round
the
foot
of
the
ladder
walking
on
only
a
narrow
board
however
we
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
mine
with
great
safety
and
credit
seeing
all
the
mighty
machinery
on
the
way
to
a
greater
depth
than
i
ever
reached
before
namely
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
pump
we
went
aside
a
short
distance
into
the
lowest
workings
where
two
men
nearly
naked
were
driving
a
level
towards
the
lode
or
vein
of
ore
here
i
felt
a
most
intolerable
heat
and
upon
moving
to
get
out
of
the
place
i
had
a
dreadful
feeling
of
feebleness
and
fainting
such
as
i
never
had
in
my
life
before
the
men
urged
me
to
climb
the
ladders
to
a
level
where
the
air
was
better
but
they
might
as
well
have
urged
me
to
lift
up
the
rock
i
could
do
nothing
but
sit
down
and
lean
fainting
against
the
rocks
this
arose
entirely
from
the
badness
of
the
air
after
a
time
i
felt
a
trifle
better
and
then
i
climbed
one
short
ladder
and
sat
down
very
faint
again
when
i
recovered
two
men
tied
a
rope
round
me
and
went
up
the
ladder
before
me
supporting
a
part
of
my
weight
and
in
this
way
i
ascended
four
or
five
ladders
with
long
rests
between
till
we
came
to
a
level
fathoms
below
the
adit
or
nearly
fathoms
below
the
surface
where
there
was
a
tolerable
current
of
pretty
good
air
here
i
speedily
recovered
though
i
was
a
little
weak
for
a
short
time
afterwards
george
also
felt
the
bad
air
a
good
deal
but
not
so
much
as
i
he
descended
to
some
workings
equally
low
in
another
place
towards
which
the
party
that
i
spoke
of
were
directing
their
works
but
said
that
the
air
there
was
by
no
means
so
bad
we
all
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
fathoms
below
the
adit
we
sat
still
a
little
while
and
i
acquired
sufficient
strength
and
nerve
so
that
i
did
not
feel
the
slightest
alarm
in
the
operation
of
ascending
by
the
this
is
the
funniest
operation
that
i
ever
saw
it
is
the
only
absolute
novelty
that
i
have
seen
since
i
was
in
the
country
before
it
has
been
introduced
years
in
tresavean
and
one
day
in
the
united
mines
in
my
last
letter
i
described
the
principle
in
the
actual
use
there
is
no
other
motion
to
be
made
by
the
person
who
is
ascending
or
descending
than
that
of
stepping
sideways
each
time
there
being
proper
with
no
exertion
at
all
except
that
of
stepping
exactly
at
the
proper
instant
and
not
the
shadow
of
unpleasant
feeling
in
the
motion
any
woman
may
go
with
the
most
perfect
comfort
if
she
will
but
attend
to
the
rules
of
stepping
and
forget
that
there
is
an
open
pit
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
mine
in
this
way
we
were
pumped
up
to
the
surface
and
came
up
as
cool
as
cucumbers
instead
of
being
drenched
with
perspiration
in
my
description
in
last
letter
i
forgot
to
mention
that
between
the
stages
on
the
moving
rods
which
i
have
there
described
there
are
intermediate
stages
on
the
moving
rods
for
which
there
is
ample
room
inasmuch
as
the
interval
between
the
stages
on
each
rod
used
by
one
person
is
feet
and
these
intermediate
stages
are
used
by
persons
so
that
there
are
persons
and
persons
at
the
same
time
who
never
interfere
with
each
other
and
never
step
on
the
same
stages
but
merely
see
each
other
passing
on
the
other
rods
it
is
a
most
valuable
invention
we
then
changed
our
clothes
and
washed
and
drove
to
barncoose
arriving
in
good
time
for
the
dinner
i
found
myself
much
restored
by
some
superb
sauterne
with
water
when
we
were
proposing
to
go
on
to
camborne
mr
and
mrs
williams
pressed
us
so
affectionately
to
stop
that
we
at
length
decided
on
stopping
for
the
night
only
bargaining
for
an
early
breakfast
this
morning
this
morning
after
breakfast
we
started
for
redruth
and
camborne
the
population
between
them
has
increased
immensely
since
i
was
here
before
here
is
a
letter
written
to
his
wife
while
he
was
engaged
on
the
business
of
the
railway
gauge
commission
it
contains
reminiscences
of
some
people
who
made
a
great
figure
in
the
railway
world
at
that
time
and
was
preceded
by
a
letter
which
was
playfully
addressed
from
the
palace
of
king
hudson
york
george
inn
york
i
wrote
yesterday
from
mr
hudson
in
time
for
the
late
post
and
hope
that
my
letter
might
be
posted
by
the
servant
to
whom
it
was
given
our
affairs
yesterday
were
simple
we
reached
euston
station
properly
found
watson
there
found
a
carriage
reserved
for
us
eat
at
wolverton
not
so
good
as
formerly
dined
at
derby
and
arrived
in
york
at
on
the
way
watson
informed
me
that
the
government
have
awarded
us
each
sir
smith
had
talked
over
the
matter
with
us
and
i
laid
it
down
as
a
principle
that
we
considered
the
business
as
an
important
one
and
one
of
very
great
responsibility
and
that
we
wished
either
that
the
government
should
treat
us
handsomely
or
should
consider
us
as
servants
of
the
state
acting
gratuitously
to
which
they
assented
i
think
the
government
have
done
very
well
mr
hudson
as
i
have
said
met
us
on
the
platform
and
pressed
us
to
dine
with
him
though
i
had
dined
twice
then
we
found
the
rival
parties
quarrelling
and
had
to
arrange
between
them
this
prevented
me
from
writing
for
the
early
post
i
forgot
to
mention
that
saunders
the
great
western
secretary
rode
with
us
all
the
way
at
hudson
we
had
really
a
very
pleasant
dinner
i
sat
between
vernon
harcourt
and
mrs
malcolm
his
sister
georgiana
and
near
to
mr
hudson
this
morning
we
were
prepared
at
at
the
station
for
some
runs
brunel
and
other
people
had
arrived
in
the
night
and
we
have
been
to
darlington
and
back
with
a
large
party
in
our
experimental
train
george
arthur
biddell
rode
on
the
engine
as
representing
me
but
the
side
wind
was
so
dreadfully
heavy
that
as
regards
the
wants
of
the
case
this
day
is
quite
thrown
away
we
have
since
been
to
lunch
with
vernon
harcourt
mrs
harcourt
not
at
home
and
then
went
with
him
to
look
at
the
cathedral
the
which
was
a
little
injured
has
been
pretty
well
restored
all
other
things
in
good
order
the
cathedral
looks
smaller
and
lower
than
french
cathedrals
now
that
we
have
come
in
the
lord
mayor
of
york
has
just
called
to
invite
us
to
dinner
i
propose
to
george
arthur
biddell
that
he
go
to
newcastle
this
evening
in
order
to
see
glass
works
and
other
things
there
and
to
return
when
he
can
i
think
that
i
can
persuade
barlow
to
stop
to
see
the
experiments
out
and
if
so
i
shall
endeavour
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
the
earliest
day
would
be
the
day
after
the
following
extract
is
from
a
letter
written
to
mr
murray
for
insertion
in
his
handbook
of
france
relating
to
the
breakwater
at
cherbourg
which
airy
had
visited
during
his
journey
in
france
in
the
autumn
of
this
year
royal
observatory
greenwich
my
opinion
on
the
construction
i
need
not
say
ought
not
to
be
quoted
but
you
are
quite
welcome
to
found
any
general
statement
on
it
or
perhaps
it
may
guide
you
in
further
enquiries
to
make
it
clear
i
must
speak
rather
generally
upon
the
subject
there
are
three
ways
in
which
a
breakwater
may
be
constructed
by
building
a
strong
wall
with
perpendicular
face
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
by
making
a
bank
with
nothing
but
slopes
towards
the
sea
by
making
a
sloping
bank
to
a
certain
height
and
then
building
a
perpendicular
wall
upon
now
if
the
of
these
constructions
could
be
arranged
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
the
best
of
all
because
a
sea
does
not
against
a
perpendicular
face
but
recoils
in
an
unbroken
swell
merely
making
a
slow
quiet
push
at
the
wall
and
not
making
a
violent
impact
but
practically
it
is
nearly
impossible
the
construction
makes
the
sea
to
break
tremendously
but
if
the
sloping
surface
be
made
of
square
stone
put
together
with
reasonable
care
there
is
not
the
smallest
tendency
to
unseat
these
stones
this
is
the
principle
of
construction
of
plymouth
breakwater
in
the
construction
the
slope
makes
the
sea
to
break
tremendously
and
then
it
strikes
the
perpendicular
face
with
the
force
of
a
battering
ram
and
therefore
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
worst
construction
of
all
a
few
may
easily
be
dislodged
and
then
the
sea
entering
with
this
enormous
force
will
speedily
destroy
the
whole
this
is
the
form
of
the
cherbourg
digue
from
this
you
will
gather
that
i
have
a
full
belief
that
plymouth
breakwater
will
last
very
long
and
that
the
digue
of
cherbourg
at
least
its
upper
wall
will
not
last
long
the
great
bank
will
last
a
good
while
gradually
suffering
degradation
but
still
protecting
the
road
pretty
well
i
was
assured
by
the
officers
residing
on
the
digue
that
the
sea
which
on
breaking
is
thrown
vertically
upwards
and
then
falls
down
upon
the
pavement
does
sometimes
push
the
stones
about
which
are
lying
there
and
which
weigh
three
or
four
tons
i
saw
some
preparations
for
the
foundations
of
the
fort
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
digue
one
artificial
stone
of
concrete
measured
and
was
estimated
to
weigh
kilogrammes
chapter
vi
at
greenwich
observatory
to
on
i
proposed
a
change
in
the
form
of
estimates
for
the
observatory
the
original
astronomical
part
was
provided
by
the
admiralty
and
the
new
magnetical
and
meteorological
part
was
provided
by
the
treasury
and
the
whole
estimates
and
accounts
of
the
observatory
never
appeared
in
one
public
paper
i
proposed
that
the
whole
should
be
placed
on
the
navy
estimates
but
the
admiralty
refused
i
repeated
this
in
subsequent
years
with
no
success
meantime
i
always
sent
to
the
admiralty
a
duplicate
of
my
treasury
estimate
with
the
proper
admiralty
railway
through
the
lower
part
of
the
park
in
tunnel
about
feet
from
the
observatory
was
again
brought
forward
on
it
was
put
before
me
by
the
government
and
on
march
i
made
experiments
at
kensal
green
specially
on
the
effect
of
a
tunnel
which
i
found
to
be
considerable
in
suppressing
the
tremors
on
may
i
made
my
report
generally
favourable
supposing
the
railway
to
be
in
tunnel
on
may
i
with
mr
stephenson
had
an
interview
at
the
admiralty
with
lord
ellenborough
and
sir
george
cockburn
the
earl
appeared
willing
to
relax
in
his
scruples
about
allowing
a
railway
through
the
park
when
sir
george
cockburn
made
a
most
solemn
protest
against
it
on
the
ground
of
danger
to
an
institution
of
such
importance
as
the
observatory
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
protest
of
sir
george
cockburn
really
determined
the
government
on
june
i
was
informed
that
the
government
refused
their
consent
after
this
the
south
eastern
railway
company
adopted
the
line
through
tranquil
in
consequence
of
the
defective
state
of
paramatta
observatory
i
had
written
to
sir
robert
peel
on
april
raising
the
question
of
a
general
superintending
board
for
colonial
observatories
and
on
june
i
saw
mr
gladstone
at
the
colonial
office
to
enquire
about
the
possibility
of
establishing
local
boards
on
june
a
general
plan
was
settled
but
it
never
came
to
forty
volumes
of
the
observatory
mss
were
bound
an
important
thermometers
were
prepared
by
prof
on
june
sir
robert
inglis
procured
an
order
of
the
house
of
commons
for
printing
a
paper
of
sir
james
south
ostensibly
on
the
effects
of
a
railway
passing
through
greenwich
park
but
really
attacking
almost
everything
that
i
did
in
the
observatory
i
replied
to
this
on
july
by
a
letter
in
the
athenaeum
addressed
to
sir
robert
inglis
in
terms
so
strong
and
so
well
supported
that
sir
james
south
was
effectually
silenced
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
of
airy
to
the
earl
of
rosse
dated
will
shew
how
pronounced
the
quarrel
between
airy
and
south
had
become
in
consequence
of
the
attack
and
previous
differences
after
the
public
exposure
which
his
conduct
in
the
last
summer
compelled
me
to
make
i
certainly
can
not
meet
him
on
equal
terms
and
desire
not
to
meet
him
at
all
ed
in
the
mag
and
met
department
i
was
constantly
engaged
with
mr
charles
brooke
in
the
preparation
and
mounting
of
the
instruments
and
the
chemical
arrangements
for
their
use
to
the
end
of
the
year
with
mr
ronalds
i
was
similarly
engaged
but
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
transacting
business
with
him
from
his
unpractical
the
equipment
of
the
liverpool
observatory
under
me
was
still
going
on
i
introduced
the
use
of
siemens
chronometric
governor
for
giving
horary
motion
to
an
equatoreal
there
i
have
since
introduced
the
same
principle
in
the
chronograph
barrel
and
the
great
equatoreal
at
greenwich
i
consider
it
on
i
received
the
astronomical
society
medal
for
the
planetary
in
the
university
of
london
at
this
time
seriously
began
the
discussion
whether
there
should
be
a
compulsory
examination
in
matters
bearing
on
religious
subjects
after
this
there
was
no
for
discovery
of
comets
three
medals
were
awarded
by
schumacher
and
me
one
to
peters
two
to
de
vico
a
comet
was
seen
by
hind
and
by
no
other
observer
after
correspondence
principally
in
the
medal
was
refused
to
with
respect
to
the
railway
gauge
commission
on
in
our
experiments
near
york
the
engine
ran
off
the
rails
on
the
commissioners
signed
the
report
and
the
business
was
concluded
by
the
end
of
april
our
recommendation
was
that
the
narrow
gauge
should
be
carried
throughout
this
was
opposed
most
violently
by
partisans
of
the
broad
gauge
and
they
had
sufficient
influence
in
parliament
to
prevent
our
recommendation
from
being
carried
into
effect
but
the
policy
even
of
the
great
western
railway
in
which
the
broad
gauge
originated
has
supported
our
views
the
narrow
gauge
has
been
gradually
substituted
for
the
broad
and
the
broad
now
scarcely
on
june
lord
canning
enquired
of
me
about
makers
for
the
clock
in
the
clock
tower
of
westminster
palace
i
suggested
vulliamy
dent
whitehurst
and
made
other
suggestions
i
had
some
correspondence
with
denison
about
i
had
much
correspondence
with
stephenson
about
the
tubular
bridge
over
the
menai
straits
stephenson
afterwards
spoke
of
my
assistance
as
having
much
supported
him
in
this
anxious
work
on
i
was
requested
to
make
a
report
and
to
charge
a
fee
as
a
civil
engineer
but
i
declined
to
do
so
in
january
i
went
with
george
arthur
biddell
to
portsmouth
to
examine
lord
rotary
engine
as
mounted
in
the
and
made
a
report
on
the
same
to
the
admiralty
and
i
made
several
subsequent
reports
on
the
same
matter
the
scheme
was
abandoned
in
the
course
of
next
year
the
real
cause
of
failure
as
i
believe
was
in
the
bad
mounting
in
the
ship
the
engrossing
subject
of
this
year
was
the
discovery
of
neptune
as
i
have
said
i
obtained
no
answer
from
adams
to
a
letter
of
enquiry
beginning
with
june
of
i
had
correspondence
of
a
satisfactory
character
with
le
verrier
who
had
taken
up
the
subject
of
the
disturbance
of
uranus
and
arrived
at
conclusions
not
very
different
from
those
of
adams
i
wrote
from
ely
on
july
to
challis
begging
him
as
in
possession
of
the
largest
telescope
in
england
to
sweep
for
the
planet
and
suggesting
a
plan
i
received
information
of
its
recognition
by
galle
when
i
was
visiting
hansen
at
gotha
for
further
official
history
see
my
communications
to
the
royal
astronomical
society
and
for
private
history
see
the
papers
in
the
royal
observatory
i
was
abused
most
savagely
both
by
english
and
french
the
report
to
the
visitors
contains
an
interesting
account
of
the
great
lunar
reductions
from
which
the
following
passage
is
extracted
of
the
third
section
containing
the
comparison
of
observed
places
with
tabular
places
three
sheets
are
printed
from
to
this
comparison
it
is
to
be
observed
does
not
contain
a
simple
comparison
of
places
but
contains
also
the
coefficients
of
the
various
changes
in
the
moon
place
depending
on
changes
in
the
elements
the
process
for
the
correction
of
the
elements
by
means
of
these
comparisons
is
now
going
on
and
the
extent
of
this
work
even
after
so
much
has
been
prepared
almost
exceeds
belief
for
the
longitude
ten
columns
are
added
in
groups
formed
in
thirteen
different
ways
each
different
way
having
on
the
average
about
nine
hundred
groups
for
the
ecliptic
polar
distance
five
columns
are
added
in
groups
formed
in
seven
different
ways
each
different
way
having
on
the
average
about
nine
hundred
groups
thus
it
will
appear
that
there
are
not
fewer
than
additions
of
columns
of
figures
this
part
of
the
work
is
not
only
completed
but
is
verified
so
that
the
books
of
comparison
of
observed
and
tabular
places
are
as
regards
this
work
completely
cleared
out
the
next
step
is
to
take
the
means
of
these
groups
a
process
which
is
now
in
hand
it
will
be
followed
by
the
formation
and
solution
of
the
equations
on
which
the
corrections
of
the
elements
depend
the
following
remarks
extracted
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
with
respect
to
the
instrumental
equipment
of
the
observatory
embody
the
views
of
the
astronomer
royal
at
this
time
the
utmost
change
which
i
contemplate
as
likely
to
occur
in
many
years
in
regard
to
our
meridional
instruments
is
the
substitution
of
instruments
of
the
same
class
carrying
telescopes
of
larger
aperture
the
only
instrument
which
as
i
think
may
possibly
be
called
for
by
the
demands
of
the
astronomer
or
the
astronomical
public
is
a
telescope
of
the
largest
size
for
the
observation
of
faint
nebulae
and
minute
double
stars
whether
the
addition
of
such
an
instrument
to
our
apparatus
would
be
an
advantage
is
in
my
opinion
not
free
from
doubt
the
line
of
conduct
for
the
observatory
is
sufficiently
well
traced
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
primary
objects
ought
to
be
the
accurate
determination
of
places
of
the
fundamental
stars
the
sun
the
planets
and
above
all
the
moon
any
addition
whatever
to
our
powers
or
our
instrumental
luxuries
which
should
tend
to
withdraw
our
energies
from
these
objects
would
be
a
misfortune
to
the
observatory
of
private
history
in
march
i
visited
sedgwick
at
on
mar
the
henry
pottinger
was
launched
from
fairbairn
yard
on
the
isle
of
dogs
where
i
was
thrown
down
and
dislocated
my
right
from
apr
to
i
was
at
on
june
hansen
arrived
and
stayed
with
me
to
july
from
july
to
i
was
visiting
dean
peacock
at
from
july
to
i
was
at
playford
where
for
the
first
time
i
lodged
in
my
own
cottage
i
had
bought
it
some
time
before
and
my
sister
had
superintended
alterations
and
the
addition
of
a
room
i
was
much
pleased
thus
to
be
connected
with
the
happy
scenes
of
my
from
to
i
was
with
my
wife
and
her
sister
elizabeth
smith
on
the
continent
we
stayed
for
some
time
at
wiesbaden
as
my
nerves
were
shaken
by
the
work
on
the
railway
gauge
commission
and
i
wanted
the
wiesbaden
waters
we
visited
various
places
in
germany
and
made
a
excursion
among
the
swiss
mountains
at
gotha
we
lodged
with
hansen
for
three
days
and
it
was
while
staying
here
that
i
heard
from
encke
on
that
galle
had
discovered
the
expected
planet
we
visited
gauss
at
göttingen
and
miss
caroline
herschel
at
hannover
we
had
a
very
bad
passage
from
hamburgh
to
london
lasting
five
days
a
broke
and
had
to
be
repaired
after
four
days
our
had
gone
off
during
the
gale
a
valuable
discovery
for
me
as
i
never
afterwards
feared
on
i
attended
the
celebration
of
the
anniversary
of
trinity
college
the
following
extracts
relating
to
the
engines
of
the
janus
are
taken
from
letters
to
his
wife
dated
from
portsmouth
and
as
soon
as
possible
we
repaired
to
the
dock
yard
and
presented
ourselves
to
the
admiral
superintendant
admiral
hyde
parker
not
sir
hyde
parker
found
that
the
janus
had
not
arrived
the
admiral
superintendant
who
does
not
spare
a
hard
word
expressing
himself
curiously
thereon
but
he
had
got
the
proper
orders
from
the
admiralty
relating
to
me
so
he
immediately
sent
for
mr
taplin
the
superintendant
of
machinery
and
we
went
off
to
see
the
small
engine
of
lord
d
d
construction
which
is
working
some
pumps
and
other
machinery
in
the
yard
it
was
kept
at
work
a
little
longer
than
usual
for
us
to
see
it
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
it
was
working
extremely
well
it
had
not
been
opened
in
any
way
for
half
a
year
and
not
for
repair
or
packing
for
a
much
longer
time
this
morning
we
went
to
the
dock
yard
and
on
entering
the
engine
house
there
was
shirreff
and
lord
d
d
soon
appeared
the
janus
had
come
to
anchor
at
spithead
late
last
night
and
had
entered
the
harbour
this
morning
blowing
weather
on
saturday
night
we
had
the
engine
pretty
well
pulled
to
pieces
and
sat
contemplating
her
a
long
time
before
this
denison
had
come
to
us
we
then
went
on
board
the
janus
with
shirreff
but
not
with
lord
d
the
engines
were
still
hot
and
so
they
were
turned
backwards
a
little
for
my
edification
this
was
convenient
because
the
vessel
being
moored
by
her
head
she
could
thus
strain
backwards
without
doing
mischief
the
vacuum
not
good
then
after
a
luncheon
on
board
it
was
agreed
to
run
out
a
little
way
but
the
engines
absolutely
stuck
fast
and
would
not
stir
a
bit
this
i
considered
a
perfect
godsend
so
the
at
my
desire
were
lashed
fast
and
we
are
to
see
her
opened
morning
this
morning
we
all
went
off
to
the
janus
where
we
expected
to
find
the
end
of
the
cylinder
where
we
believe
block
to
have
taken
place
withdrawn
but
it
was
not
near
it
after
a
great
many
bolts
were
drawn
it
was
discovered
that
one
bolt
could
not
be
drawn
and
in
order
to
get
room
for
working
at
it
it
was
necessary
to
take
off
the
end
of
the
other
cylinder
and
such
a
job
three
pulley
hooks
were
broken
in
my
sight
and
i
believe
some
out
of
my
sight
however
this
auxiliary
end
was
at
last
got
off
and
the
people
began
to
act
on
the
refractory
bolt
but
by
this
time
it
was
getting
dark
and
the
men
were
leaving
the
dockyard
so
i
left
arranging
that
what
they
could
do
in
preparation
for
me
might
be
done
in
good
time
morning
on
i
circulated
an
address
proposing
to
discontinue
the
use
of
the
zenith
tube
because
it
had
been
found
by
a
long
course
of
comparative
trials
that
the
zenith
tube
was
not
more
accurate
than
the
mural
circle
the
address
stated
that
want
of
superior
efficiency
of
the
zenith
tube
which
considered
in
reference
to
the
expectations
that
had
been
formed
of
its
accuracy
must
be
estimated
as
a
positive
failure
is
probably
due
to
two
circumstances
one
is
the
use
of
a
which
appears
to
be
affected
with
various
causes
of
unsteadiness
the
other
is
the
insuperable
difficulty
of
ventilating
the
room
in
which
the
instrument
is
mounted
on
december
i
circulated
an
address
proposing
a
transit
circle
with
telescope
of
inches
aperture
the
address
states
as
follows
clear
aperture
of
the
of
our
transit
instrument
is
very
nearly
inches
that
of
our
mural
circle
is
very
nearly
inches
i
had
been
requested
by
the
of
ordnance
i
think
to
examine
candidates
for
a
mastership
in
woolwich
academy
and
i
was
employed
on
it
in
february
and
march
in
conjunction
with
prof
in
january
i
applied
to
lord
auckland
for
to
make
an
astronomical
journey
on
the
continent
but
he
on
mar
sir
james
south
addressed
to
the
admiralty
a
formal
complaint
against
me
for
not
observing
with
the
astronomical
instruments
on
mar
i
was
triumphantly
acquitted
by
the
in
june
i
was
requested
by
the
commissioners
of
railways
to
act
as
president
of
a
commission
on
iron
bridges
suggested
by
the
fall
of
the
bridge
at
chester
lord
auckland
objected
to
it
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
the
trouble
of
in
december
i
was
requested
and
undertook
to
prepare
the
astronomical
part
of
the
scientific
manual
for
naval
on
occurred
a
very
remarkable
magnetic
storm
to
which
there
had
been
nothing
comparable
before
mr
glaisher
had
it
observed
by
eye
extremely
well
and
i
printed
and
circulated
a
paper
concerning
hansen
stimulated
by
the
lunar
reductions
discovered
two
long
inequalities
in
the
motion
of
the
moon
produced
by
the
action
of
venus
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
this
matter
is
thus
referred
to
the
last
summer
i
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
hansen
at
gotha
and
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
exhibit
to
him
the
corrections
of
the
elements
from
these
reductions
and
strongly
to
call
his
attention
to
their
certainty
the
peculiarity
of
their
fluctuations
and
the
necessity
of
seeking
for
some
physical
explanation
i
have
much
pleasure
in
indulging
in
the
thought
that
it
was
mainly
owing
to
this
representation
that
hansen
undertook
that
quest
which
has
terminated
in
the
discovery
of
his
two
new
lunar
inequalities
the
most
remarkable
discovery
i
think
in
physical
astronomy
in
discussing
points
relating
to
the
discovery
of
neptune
i
made
an
unfortunate
blunder
in
a
paper
hastily
sent
to
the
athenaeum
i
said
that
arago
conduct
had
been
indelicate
i
perceived
instantly
that
i
had
used
a
wrong
expression
and
by
the
very
next
post
i
sent
an
altered
expression
this
altered
expression
was
not
received
in
time
and
the
original
expression
was
printed
to
my
great
sorrow
i
could
not
then
apologize
but
at
what
appeared
to
be
the
first
opportunity
in
december
i
did
apologize
and
my
apology
was
accepted
but
i
think
that
arago
was
never
again
so
cordial
as
on
july
hebe
was
discovered
after
this
iris
and
flora
now
commenced
that
train
of
discoveries
which
has
added
more
than
planets
to
the
solar
on
was
an
annular
eclipse
of
the
sun
of
which
the
limit
of
annularity
passed
near
to
greenwich
to
determine
the
exact
place
i
equipped
observatories
at
hayes
lewisham
south
end
lewisham
village
blackwall
stratford
walthamstow
and
chingford
the
weather
was
bad
and
no
observation
was
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
in
the
dispute
between
the
partisans
of
adams
and
le
verrier
was
so
violent
that
no
medal
could
be
awarded
to
either
in
i
with
other
fellows
of
the
society
promoted
a
special
meeting
for
considering
such
a
modification
of
the
that
for
this
occasion
only
it
might
be
permissible
to
give
two
medals
after
two
days
stormy
discussion
it
was
in
the
university
of
london
at
a
meeting
in
july
where
the
religious
question
was
discussed
it
was
proposed
to
receive
some
testimonial
from
affiliated
bodies
or
to
consider
that
or
some
other
plan
for
introducing
religious
literature
as
the
propriety
of
this
was
doubtful
there
was
a
general
feeling
for
taking
legal
advice
and
it
was
set
aside
solely
on
purpose
to
raise
the
question
about
legal
consultation
was
negatived
by
vote
and
i
then
claimed
the
consideration
of
the
question
which
we
had
put
aside
for
it
by
the
influence
of
warburton
this
was
denied
i
wrote
a
letter
to
be
laid
before
the
meeting
on
july
when
i
was
necessarily
absent
urging
my
claim
my
letter
was
put
aside
i
determined
never
to
sit
with
warburton
again
on
i
intimated
to
lord
burlington
my
wish
to
retire
and
on
he
transmitted
to
the
home
secretary
my
resignation
he
lord
burlington
fully
expressed
his
opinion
that
my
claim
ought
to
have
been
on
june
on
the
occasion
of
prince
albert
state
visit
to
cambridge
knighthood
was
offered
to
me
through
his
secretary
sedgwick
but
i
declined
in
september
the
russian
order
of
st
stanislas
was
offered
to
me
mr
de
berg
the
secretary
of
embassy
coming
to
greenwich
personally
to
announce
it
but
i
was
compelled
by
our
government
rules
to
decline
i
invited
le
verrier
to
england
and
escorted
him
to
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
oxford
in
as
regards
the
westminster
clock
on
the
parliamentary
building

excessively
angry
with
me
on

a
great
parliamentary
paper
was
prepared
in

to
an
order
of
the
house
of
lords
for
correspondence

going
on

the
direction
of
sylvester

mar
it
was
i
believe
at
that
time
that
the
fire
occurred
in
chatham
dock
yard
which
burnt
the
whole
of
the
i
was
tired
of
my
machinery
and
from
the
extending
use
of
iron
ships
the
probable
value
of
it
was
much
diminished
and
i
made
no
effort
to
restore
it
of
private
history
in
february
i
went
to
derby
to
see
clock
factory
and
went
on

with
the
object
of
inspecting
the
pulkowa
observatory
i
went
by
hamburg
to
altona
where
i
met
struve
and
started
with
him
in
an
open
waggon
for
lübeck
where
we
arrived
on
we
proceeded
by
steamer
to
cronstadt
and
petersburg
and
so
to
pulkowa
where
i
lodged
with
struve
i
was
here
engaged

and
at
st

and
at

met
count
colloredo
count
ouvaroff
count

lord

british
ambassador
and
others
on
i
went
in
a
small
steamer
to
cronstadt
and
then
in
the
vladimir
to
swinemünde
we
were
then
towed
in
a
passage
boat
to
stettin
and
i
proceeded
by
railway
to
berlin
on
i
found
galle
and
saw
the
observatory
on
i
went
to
potzdam
and
saw
humboldt
on
the
i
went
to
hamburg
and
lodged
with
schumacher
i
here
visited
repsold
and
rümker
on
i
embarked
in
the
john
bull
for
london
and
arrived
there
on
the
evening
of
the
on
the
it
was
blowing
whole
gale
reported
to
be
the
heaviest
gale
known
for
so
many
hours
bullocks
and
sheep
were
thrown
from
to
i
was
at
cambridge
and
from
the
to
at
playford
here
is
a
letter
to
his
wife
written
from
birmingham
containing
a
note
of
the
progress
of
the
ironwork
for
the
menai
bridge
edgbaston
birmingham
apr
yesterday
morning
we
started
between
and
for
stourbridge
first
to
see
some
clay
which
is
celebrated
all
over
the
world
as
the
only
clay
which
is
fit
to
make
pots
for
melting
glass
you
know
that
in
all
these
fiery
regions
is
a
thing
of
very
great
importance
as
no
furnace
will
stand
if
made
of
any
ordinary
bricks
and
even
with
the
the
small
furnaces
are
examined
every
week
but
this
stourbridge
clay
is
as
superior
to
as
is
to
common
then
we
went
to
fosters
puddling
and
rolling
works
near
stourbridge
these
are
on
a
very
large
scale
of
course
much
that
we
saw
was
a
repetition
of
what
we
had
seen
before
but
there
were
slitting
mills
machines
for
rolling
the
puddled
blooms
instead
of
hammering
them
and
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
handling
the
puddling
irons
ourselves
then
we
went
to
another
work
of
the
fosters
not
far
from
dudley
where
part
of
the
work
of
the
tube
bridge
for
the
menai
is
going
on
the
fosters
are
i
believe
the
largest
iron
masters
in
the
country
and
the
two
principal
partners
the
elder
mr
foster
and
his
nephew
accompanied
us
in
all
our
inspections
and
steppings
from
one
set
of
works
to
another
the
length
of
tube
bridge
which
they
have
in
hand
here
is
only
feet
about
of
the
whole
length
and
at
present
they
are
only
busy
on
the
bottom
part
of
it
but
it
is
a
prodigious
thing
i
shall
be
anxious
about
it
then
we
went
to
other
works
of
the
fosters
at
king
wynford
where
they
have
blast
furnaces
and
here
after
seeing
all
other
usual
things
we
saw
the
furnaces
tapped
in
this
district
the
fosters
work
the
coal
in
a
way
different
from
any
body
else
they
work
out
the
upper
half
of
its
thickness
and
then
leave
the
ground
to
fall
in
after
a
year
or
two
this
ground
becomes
so
hard
as
to
make
a
good
safe
roof
and
then
they
work
away
the
other
half
thus
they
avoid
much
of
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
working
the
thick
bed
all
at
once
the
ventilation
of
these
mines
scarcely
ever
requires
fires
and
then
only
what
they
call
lamps
those
little
which
are
used
for
giving
light
at
night
in
the
northumberland
and
durham
pits
they
constantly
have
immense
roaring
fires
to
make
a
draught
then
we
came
home
through
dudley
during
his
stay
in
russia
there
was
a
great
desire
manifested
by
the
astronomers
and
scientific
men
of
russia
that
he
should
be
presented
to
the
emperor
this
would
no
doubt
have
taken
place
had
not
the
movements
of
the
court
and
his
own
want
of
time
prevented
it
the
following
letter
to
the
british
ambassador
lord
bloomfield
relates
to
this
matter
pulkowa
august
my
lord
i
had
the
honour
yesterday
to
receive
your
lordship
note
of
sunday
last
which
by
some
irregularity
in
the
communications
with
this
place
reached
me
i
believe
later
than
it
ought
from
this
circumstance
and
also
from
my
being
made
acquainted
only
this
afternoon
with
some
official
arrangements
i
am
compelled
to
trouble
you
at
a
time
which
i
fear
is
less
convenient
than
i
could
have
desired
the
object
of
my
present
communication
is
to
ask
whether
if
the
movements
of
the
court
permit
it
it
would
be
agreeable
to
your
lordship
to
present
me
to
the
emperor
in
explanation
of
this
enquiry
i
beg
leave
to
state
that
this
is
an
honour
to
which
personally
i
could
not
think
of
aspiring
my
presence
however
at
pulkowa
at
this
time
is
in
an
official
character
as
astronomer
royal
of
england
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
make
myself
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
observatory
of
pulkowa
and
this
is
the
sole
object
of
my
journey
to
russia
it
is
understood
that
the
emperor
takes
great
interest
in
the
reputation
of
the
observatory
and
i
am
confident
that
the
remarks
upon
it
which
i
am
able
to
make
would
be
agreeable
to
him
i
place
these
reasons
before
you
awaiting
entirely
your
decision
on
the
propriety
of
the
step
to
which
i
have
alluded
i
am
to
leave
st
petersburg
on
saturday
the
of
september
i
have
the
honor
to
be
my
lord
your
lordship
very
faithful
servant
airy
bloomfield
it
was
probably
in
acknowledgment
of
this
letter
that
in
due
time
he
received
the
following
letter
with
the
offer
of
the
russian
order
of
st
stanislas
monsieur
royal
sa
majesté
en
appréciant
les
travaux
assidus
qui
vous
ont
donné
une
place
distinguée
au
rang
des
plus
illustres
astronomes
de
et
la
coopération
bienveillante
que
vous
cessé

thereon
for
conducting
with
efficiency
and
with
credit
to
the
nation
the
institution
which
is
entrusted
to
me
i
have
judged
it
proper
to
cultivate
intimate
relations
with
the
principal
observatories
of
europe
and
in
particular
with
the
great
observatory
founded
by
the
emperor

at
pulkowa
near
st
petersburg
i
have
several
times
received
mr

observatory
at
greenwich
and
in
the
past
summer
i
made
a
journey
to
st
petersburg
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
observatory
of
pulkowa
since
my
return
from
russia
i
have
received
a
communication
from
count

minister
of
public
instruction
in
the
russian
empire
informing
me
that
the

and
i
have
the

it
is
permitted

have
the

be
my

to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
of
the
inst
and
to
transmit
to
you
the
enclosed
paper
respecting
foreign
orders
by
which
you
will
perceive
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
regulations
to
grant
you
the
permission
you
desire
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
grey
airy
the
passage
in
the
regulations
referred
to
above
is
quoted
in
the
following
letter
to
count
ouvaroff
royal
observatory
greenwich
sir
referring
to
your
excellency
letter
of
the
september
and
to
my
answer
of
the
september
in
which
i
expressed
my
sense
of
the
high
honor
conferred
on
me
by
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
russia
in
offering
me
through
your
excellency
the
order
of
st
stanislas
and
my
pride
in
accepting
it
i
beg
leave
further
to
acquaint
you
that
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
make
enquiry
of
lord
john
russell
first
lord
of
her
majesty
treasury
as
to
my
competency
to
accept
this
decoration
from
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
russia
and
that
his
lordship
in
reply
has
referred
me
to
the
following
regulation
of
the
british
court
that
no
subject
of
her
majesty
could
be
allowed
to
accept
the
insignia
of
a
foreign
order
from
any
sovereign
of
a
foreign
state
except
they
shall
be
so
conferred
in
consequence
of
active
and
distinguished
services
before
the
enemy
either
at
sea
or
in
the
field
or
unless
he
shall
have
been
actually
employed
in
the
service
of
the
foreign
sovereign
in
consequence
of
the
stringency
of
this
regulation
it
is
my
duty
now
to
state
to
your
excellency
that
i
am
unable
to
accept
the
decoration
which
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
russia
was
pleased
through
your
excellency
to
offer
to
me
i
beg
leave
to
repeat
the
expression
of
my
profound
reverence
to
his
majesty
and
of
my
deep
sense
of
the
honor
which
he
has
done
me
i
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
your
excellency
very
faithful
and
obedient
servant
airy
his
excellency
count
ouvaroff
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
a
very
handsome
gold
medal
specially
struck
was
transmitted
by
count
ouvaroff
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
of
russia
to
mr
airy
in
april
i
received
authority
to
purchase
of
simms
an
for
the
new
transit
circle
for
the
glass
was
tested
and
found
satisfactory
while
at
playford
in
january
i
drew
the
first
plans
of
the
transit
circle
and
may
sketched
some
parts
definite
plans
were
soon
sent
to
ransomes
and
may
and
to
simms
in
march
the
instrument
and
the
building
were
proceeded
with
during
the
year
the
new
transit
circle
was
to
be
erected
in
the
circle
room
and
considerable
arrangement
was
necessary
for
continuing
the
circle
observations
with
the
existing
instruments
whilst
the
new
instrument
was
under
erection
when
the
new
transit
is
completely
mounted
the
old
transit
instrument
may
be
removed
and
the
transit
room
will
be
free
for
any
other
purpose
i
propose
to
take
it
as
private
room
for
the
astronomer
on
may
i
made
my
first
proposal
of
the
reflex
zenith
tube
the
principle
of
it
is
as
follows
let
the
micrometer
be
placed
close
to
the
the
frame
of
the
micrometer
being
firmly
connected
with
the
cell
and
a
reflecting
being
used
with
no
material
tube
passing
over
the
and
let
a
basin
of
quicksilver
be
placed
below
the
but
in
no
mechanical
connection
with
it
at
a
distance
equal
to
half
the
focal
length
of
the
such
an
instrument
would
at
least
be
free
from
all
uncertainties
of
twist
of
viscosity
of
water
attachment
of
upper
microscope
attachment
of
lower
microscope
and
the
observations
connected
with
them
and
might
be
expected
as
a
result
of
this
extreme
simplicity
to
give
accurate
a
considerable
error
was
discovered
in
the
graduation
of
troughton
circle
amounting
in
one
part
to
six
seconds
which
is
referred
to
as
follows
instance
has
strongly
confirmed
me
in
an
opinion
which
i
have
long
held
that
no
independent
division
is
comparable
in
general
accuracy
to
where
the
fundamental
divisions
of
the
engine
have
been
made
by
troughton
method
and
where
in
any
case
the
determination
by
the
astronomer
of
errors
of
a
few
divisions
will
suffice
in
consequence
of
the
uniformity
of
law
of
error
to
give
the
errors
of
the
intermediate
divisions
the
method
of
observing
with
the
altazimuth
is
carefully
described
and
the
effect
of
it
in
increasing
the
number
of
observations
of
the
moon
is
thus
given
for
the
thirteen
lunations
between
may
and
may
of
days
of
complete
observations
with
the
meridional
instruments
number
of
days
of
complete
observations
with
altitude
and
azimuth
instrument
the
results
of
the
observations
appear
very
good
perhaps
a
little
and
but
a
little
inferior
to
those
of
the
meridional
instruments
i
consider
that
the
object
for
which
this
instrument
was
erected
is
successfully
attained
being
satisfied
with
the
general
efficiency
of
the
system
arranged
by
mr
brooke
for
our
photographic
records
of
magnetical
observations
i
wrote
to
the
admiralty
in
his
favour
and
on
the
admiralty
ordered
the
payment
of
to
him
a
committee
of
the
royal
society
also
recommended
a
reward
of
to
mr
ronalds
which
i
believe
was
paid
to
on
may
the
last
revise
of
the
lunar
reductions
was
passed
and
on
may
copies
were
sent
for
in
this
year
schumacher
and
i
refused
a
medal
to
miss
mitchell
for
a
comet
discovered
because
the
rules
of
correspondence
had
not
been
strictly
followed
the
king
of
denmark
gave
one
by
special
in
this
year
occurred
the
discovery
of
saturn
satellite
by
mr
lassell
upon
which
i
have
various
on
the
of
december
the
degree
of
was
conferred
upon
me
by
the
university
of
the
ipswich
lectures
a
wish
had
been
expressed
that
i
would
give
a
series
of
astronomical
lectures
to
the
people
of
ipswich
i
therefore
arranged
with
great
care
the
necessary
apparatus
and
lectured
six
evenings
in
a
room
i
forget
its
name
it
might
be
temperance
hall
high
above
st
matthew
street
from
mar
to
the
end
of
the
week
a
shorthand
writer
took
them
down
and
these
formed
the
lectures
which
were
afterwards
published
by
the
ipswich
museum
for
whose
benefit
the
lectures
were
given
and
by
myself
in
several
editions
and
afterwards
by
messrs
macmillan
in
repeated
editions
under
the
title
of
popular
astronomy
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
include
under
one
body
all
the
unconnected
commissions
of
sewers
for
the
metropolis
and
lord
morpeth
requested
me
to
be
a
member
its
operations
began
on
in
constitution
it
was
the
most
foolish
that
i
ever
knew
consisting
of
i
think
some
persons
who
could
not
possibly
attend
to
it
it
came
to
an
end
in
the
next
year
of
private
history
i
was
at
playford
from
to
and
again
from
to
also
at
playford
from
june
to
july
from
to
i
was
in
ireland
on
a
visit
to
lord
rosse
at
parsonstown
chiefly
engaged
on
trials
of
his
large
telescope
i
returned
by
liverpool
where
i
inspected
the
liverpool
equatoreal
and
clockwork
and
examined
mr
lassell
telescopes
and
grinding
from
to
i
was
at
edinburgh
with
my
wife
on
a
visit
to
forbes
we
made
various
excursions
and
i
attended
lectures
by
wilson
and
sir
hamilton
on
the
i
gave
a
lecture
in
forbes
room
i
received
the
honorary
degree
of
and
made
a
statement
on
the
telescopes
of
lord
rosse
and
mr
lassell
to
the
royal
society
of
edinburgh
returned
to
greenwich
by
brampton
here
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
ipswich
lectures
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
dated
playford
mar
at
the
proper
time
i
went
to
the
hall
found
a
chairman
installed
mr
western
was
presented
to
him
and
by
him
presented
to
the
audience
made
my
bow
and
commenced
the
room
was
quite
full
i
have
rarely
seen
such
a
sea
of
faces
about
i
believe
everything
went
off
extremely
well
except
that
the
rollers
of
the
moving
piece
of
sky
would
squeak
but
people
did
not
mind
it
and
when
first
a
star
passed
the
meridian
then
jupiter
then
some
stars
and
then
saturn
he
was
much
applauded
before
beginning
i
gave
notice
that
i
should
wait
to
answer
questions
and
as
soon
as
the
lecture
was
finished
the
chairman
repeated
this
and
begged
people
to
ask
so
several
people
did
ask
very
pertinent
questions
from
the
benches
shewing
that
they
had
attended
well
others
came
up
and
asked
questions
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
written
to
his
wife
while
on
his
visit
to
lord
rosse
at
parsonstown
in
ireland
on
the
way
he
stopped
at
bangor
and
looked
at
the
tubular
bridge
works
which
are
thus
referred
to
stopped
at
bangor
settled
at
the
castle
and
then
walked
past
the
suspension
bridge
towards
the
tube
works
which
are
about
mile
of
the
suspension
bridge
the
way
was
by
a
path
through
fields
near
the
water
side
and
from
one
or
two
points
in
this
the
appearance
of
the
suspension
bridge
was
most
majestic
the
tube
bridge
consists
of
four
spans
two
over
water
and
two
over
sloping
land
the
parts
for
the
double
tube
over
the
water
spans
four
lengths
of
tube
are
building
on
a
platform
as
at
conway
to
be
floated
by
barges
as
there
the
parts
over
the
sloping
banks
are
to
be
built
in
their
place
on
an
immense
scaffolding
i
suspect
that
in
regard
to
these
parts
stephenson
is
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
money
to
uniformity
of
plan
and
that
it
would
have
been
much
cheaper
to
build
out
stone
arches
to
the
piers
touching
the
water
the
tube
works
are
evidently
the
grand
promenade
of
the
idlers
about
bangor
i
saw
many
scores
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
walking
that
way
with
their
baskets
of
provision
evidently
going
to
gipsy
in
the
fields
close
by
the
castle
parsonstown
after
tea
it
was
voted
that
the
night
was
likely
to
be
fine
so
we
all
turned
out
the
night
was
uncertain
sometimes
entirely
clouded
sometimes
partially
but
objects
were
pretty
well
seen
when
the
sky
was
clear
the
latter
part
was
much
steadier
from
the
interruption
by
clouds
the
slowness
of
finding
with
and
managing
a
large
instrument
especially
as
their
finding
apparatus
is
not
perfectly
arranged
and
the
desire
of
looking
well
at
an
object
when
we
had
got
it
we
did
not
look
at
many
objects
the
principal
were
saturn
and
the
annular
nebula
of
lyra
with
the
saturn
a
remarkable
cluster
of
stars
and
a
remarkable
planetary
nebula
with
the
with
the
large
telescope
the
evidence
of
the
quantity
of
light
is
prodigious
and
the
light
of
an
object
is
seen
in
the
field
without
any
colour
or
any
spreading
of
stray
light
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
vision
with
a
reflecting
telescope
may
be
much
more
perfect
than
with
a
refractor
with
these
large
apertures
the
rings
round
the
stars
are
insensible
the
planetary
nebula
looked
a
mass
of
living
and
intensely
brilliant
light
this
is
an
object
which
i
do
not
suppose
can
be
seen
at
all
in
our
ordinary
telescopes
the
definition
of
the
stars
near
the
zenith
is
extremely
good
with
a
high
power
as
they
are
points
or
very
nearly
so
indeed
i
believe
quite
so
so
that
it
is
clear
that
the
whole
light
from
the
great
mirror
is
collected
into
a
space
not
bigger
than
the
point
of
a
needle
but
in
other
positions
of
the
telescope
the
definition
is
not
good
and
we
must
look
to
see
what
is
the
cause
of
this
fault
it
is
not
a
fault
in
the
telescope
properly
but
it
is
either
a
tilt
of
the
mirror
or
an
upon
the
mirror
when
the
telescope
points
lower
down
which
distorts
its
figure
or
something
of
that
kind
so
i
could
not
see
saturn
at
all
well
for
which
i
was
sorry
as
i
could
so
well
have
compared
his
appearance
with
what
i
have
seen
before
i
shall
be
very
much
pleased
if
we
can
make
out
what
is
the
fault
of
adjustment
and
so
correct
it
as
to
get
good
images
everywhere
it
is
evident
that
the
figuring
of
the
mirror
the
polishing
and
the
general
arrangement
are
perfectly
managed
the
castle
parsonstown
yesterday
we
were
employed
entirely
about
the
great
telescope
beginning
rather
late
the
principal
objects
had
relation
to
the
fault
of
definition
when
the
telescope
is
pointed
low
which
i
had
remarked
on
the
preceding
night
and
were
to
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
mechanism
of
the
mirror
mounting
generally
and
to
measure
in
various
ways
whether
the
mirror
actually
does
shift
its
place
when
the
telescope
is
set
to
different
angles
of
elevation
for
the
latter
we
found
that
the
mirror
actually
does
tilt
of
an
inch
when
the
tube
points
low
this
of
itself
will
not
account
for
the
fault
but
it
indicates
that
the
lower
part
is
held
fast
in
a
way
that
may
cause
a
strain
which
would
produce
the
fault
these
operations
and
reasonings
took
a
good
deal
of
time
lord
rosse
is
disposed
to
make
an
alteration
in
the
mounting
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
this
possible
strain
the
castle
parsonstown
the
weather
here
is
still
vexatious
but
not
absolutely
repulsive
yesterday
morning
lord
rosse
arranged
a
new
method
of
suspending
the
great
mirror
so
as
to
take
its
edgewise
pressure
in
a
manner
that
allowed
the
springy
supports
of
its
flat
back
to
act
this
employed
his
workmen
all
day
so
that
the
proposed
finish
of
polishing
the
new
mirror
could
not
go
on
i
took
one
camera
lucida
sketch
of
the
instrument
in
the
morning
dodging
the
heavy
showers
as
well
as
i
could
then
as
the
afternoon
was
extremely
fine
i
took
another
with
my
head
almost
roasted
by
the
sun
this
last
view
is
extremely
pretty
and
characteristic
embracing
parts
of
the
mounting
not
shewn
well
in
the
others
and
also
shewing
the
castle
the
observatory
and
the
telescope
the
night
promised
exceedingly
well
but
when
we
got
actually
to
the
telescope
it
began
to
cloud
and
at
length
became
hopeless
however
i
saw
that
the
fault
which
i
had
remarked
on
the
two
preceding
nights
was
gone
there
is
now
a
slight
exhibition
of
another
fault
to
a
much
smaller
extent
we
shall
probably
be
looking
at
the
telescope
in
reference
to
it
the
castle
parsonstown
yesterday
we
made
some
alterations
in
the
mounting
of
the
great
mirror
we
found
that
sundry
levers
were
loose
which
ought
to
be
firm
and
we
conjectured
with
great
probability
the
cause
of
this
for
correction
of
which
a
change
in
other
parts
was
necessary
the
mirror
was
then
found
to
preserve
its
position
much
more
fixedly
than
before
at
night
upon
trying
the
telescope
we
found
it
very
faulty
for
stars
near
the
zenith
where
it
had
been
free
from
fault
before
the
screws
which
we
had
driven
hard
were
then
loosened
and
immediately
it
was
made
very
good
then
we
tried
with
some
lower
objects
and
it
was
good
almost
equally
good
there
for
saturn
it
was
very
greatly
superior
to
what
it
had
been
before
still
it
is
not
satisfactory
to
us
and
at
this
time
a
strong
chain
is
in
preparation
to
support
the
mirror
edgeways
instead
of
the
posts
that
there
were
at
first
or
the
iron
hoop
which
we
had
on
it
yesterday
nobody
would
have
conceived
that
an
edgewise
gripe
of
such
a
mass
of
metal
could
derange
its
form
in
this
way
last
night
was
the
finest
night
we
have
had
as
regards
clouds
though
perhaps
not
the
best
for
definition
of
objects
the
castle
parsonstown
i
can
not
learn
that
the
fault
in
the
mirror
had
been
noticed
before
but
i
fancy
that
the
observations
had
been
very
much
confined
to
the
zenith
and
its
neighbourhood
in
july
the
new
to
the
observatory
were
laid
from
blackheath
before
this
time
the
supply
of
water
to
the
observatory
had
been
made
by
a
pipe
leading
up
from
the
lower
part
of
the
park
and
was
not
in
may
the
new
staircase
from
my
to
the
octagon
room
was
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
there
is
a
curious
account
of
mr
breen
one
of
the
assistants
personal
equation
which
was
found
to
be
different
in
quantity
for
observations
of
the
moon
and
observations
of
the
the
most
important
set
of
observations
of
planets
was
a
series
of
measures
of
saturn
in
four
directions
at
the
time
when
his
ring
had
disappeared
they
appear
completely
to
negative
the
idea
that
saturn
form
differs
sensibly
from
an
among
the
general
remarks
of
the
report
the
following
appears
change
in
prospect
will
depend
on
the
use
of
galvanism
and
as
a
probable
instance
of
the
application
of
this
agent
i
may
mention
that
although
no
positive
step
has
hitherto
been
taken
i
fully
expect
in
no
long
time
to
make
the
going
of
all
the
clocks
in
the
observatory
depend
on
one
original
regulator
the
same
means
will
probably
be
employed
to
increase
the
general
utility
of
the
observatory
by
the
extensive
dissemination
throughout
the
kingdom
of
accurate
moved
by
an
original
clock
at
the
royal
observatory
and
i
have
already
entered
into
correspondence
with
the
authorities
of
the
south
eastern
railway
whose
line
of
galvanic
communication
will
shortly
pass
within
nine
furlongs
of
the
observatory
in
reference
to
this
subject
i
agreed
with
schumacher
in
giving
no
medal
to
mr
bond
his
comet
was
found
to
be
petersen
five
medals
were
awarded
for
comets
in
hind
colla

brorsen
schweizer
the
liverpool
observatory
was
finished
this
year
and
the
thanks
of
the
town
council
were
presented
to
respecting
observations
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
had
received
the
admiralty
sanction
for
proceeding
with
calculations
in
and
i
employed
computers
as
was
convenient
on
july
of
this
year
i
was
ready
with
final
results
and
began
to
make
enquiries
about
personal
history
and
the
early
history
of
the
cape
observatory
on
i
applied
for
sanction
for
printing
which
was
given
and
the
work
was
soon
finished
off
in
the
astronomical
in
the
month
of
march
i
had
commenced
correspondence
with
various
persons
on
the
imperfect
state
of
publication
of
the
british
survey
sheets
of
the
map
were
issued
by
scores
but
not
one
of
them
had
an
indication
of
latitude
or
longitude
engraved
i
knew
that
great
pains
had
been
taken
in
giving
to
the
principal
triangulation
a
degree
of
accuracy
never
before
reached
and
in
fixing
the
astronomical
latitudes
of
many
stations
with
unequalled
precision
finally
i
prepared
for
the
council
of
the
royal
society
a
very
strong
representation
on
these
subjects
which
was
adopted
and
presented
to
the
government
it
was
entirely
successful
and
the
maps
were
in
future
furnished
with
latitude
and
longitude
i
was
elected
president
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
on
feb
in
june
i
went
with
sheepshanks
to
see
some
of
the
operation
of
measuring
a
base
on
salisbury
plain
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
to
his
wife
dated
june
relates
to
this
expedition
the
morning
we
started
before
eight
in
an
open
carriage
to
the
plain
looking
into
old
sarum
on
our
way
the
base
is
measured
on
what
i
should
think
a
most
unfavourable
line
its
north
end
from
which
they
have
begun
now
in
verification
of
the
old
measure
being
the
very
highest
point
in
the
whole
plain
called
beacon
hill
the
soldiers
measure
only
feet
in
a
day
so
it
will
take
them
a
good
while
to
measure
the
whole
seven
miles
while
we
were
there
hall
colby
successor
and
yolland
and
cosset
came
of
private
history
i
made
short
visits
to
playford
in
january
april
and
july
from
july
to
i
made
an
expedition
with
my
wife
to
orkney
and
from
to
i
was
at
hawkhurst
on
a
visit
to
sir
john
herschel
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
opens
with
the
following
paragraph
recording
the
proceedings
at
the
royal
observatory
during
the
last
year
i
have
less
of
novelty
to
communicate
to
the
visitors
than
in
the
reports
of
several
years
past
still
i
trust
that
the
present
report
will
not
be
uninteresting
as
exhibiting
i
hope
a
steady
and
vigorous
adherence
to
a
general
plan
long
since
matured
accompanied
with
a
reasonable
watchfulness
for
the
introduction
of
new
instruments
and
new
methods
when
they
may
seem
desirable
since
the
introduction
of
the
instruments
a
good
many
experiments
had
been
made
to
obtain
the
most
suitable
light
and
the
report
states
that
change
whatever
has
been
made
in
these
instruments
except
by
the
introduction
of
the
light
of
charged
with
the
vapour
of
for
photographic
both
of
the
magnetic
and
of
the
meteorological
instruments
the
chemical
treatment
of
the
paper
is
now
so
well
understood
by
the
assistants
that
a
failure
is
almost
unknown
and
generally
speaking
the
photographs
are
most
beautiful
and
give
conceptions
of
the
continual
disturbances
in
terrestrial
magnetism
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
acquire
from
amongst
the
general
remarks
of
the
report
it
is
stated
that
are
two
points
which
have
distinctly
engaged
my
attention
the
first
of
these
is
the
introduction
of
the
american
method
of
observing
transits
by
completing
a
galvanic
circuit
by
means
of
a
touch
of
the
finger
at
the
instant
of
appulse
of
the
transiting
body
to
the
wire
of
the
instrument
which
circuit
will
then
animate
a
magnet
that
will
make
an
impression
upon
a
moving
paper
after
careful
consideration
of
this
method
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
in
mitchell
form
it
does
possess
the
advantages
which
have
been
ascribed
to
it
and
that
it
may
possess
peculiar
advantages
in
this
observatory
where
the
of
transits
made
with
two
different
instruments
the
transit
and
the
altazimuth
is
of
the
highest
importance
the
second
point
is
the
connection
of
the
observatory
with
the
galvanic
telegraph
of
the
south
eastern
railway
and
with
other
lines
of
galvanic
wire
with
which
that
telegraph
communicates
i
had
formerly
in
mind
only
the
connection
of
this
observatory
with
different
parts
of
the
great
british
island
but
i
now
think
it
possible
that
our
communications
may
be
extended
far
beyond
its
shores
the
promoters
of
the
submarine
telegraph
are
very
confident
of
the
practicability
of
completing
a
galvanic
connection
between
england
and
france
and
i
now
begin
to
think
it
more
than
possible
that
within
a
few
years
observations
at
paris
and
brussels
may
be
registered
on
the
recording
surfaces
at
greenwich
and
vice
prof
hansen
was
engaged
in
forming
lunar
tables
from
his
lunar
theory
but
was
stopped
for
want
of
money
on
mar
i
represented
this
privately
to
mr
baring
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
on
mar
i
wrote
officially
to
the
admiralty
soliciting
with
the
prospect
if
necessary
of
making
it
on
apr
the
admiralty
gave
their
assent
the
existence
of
lunar
tables
is
due
to
this
the
king
of
denmark
medal
for
comets
was
discontinued
owing
to
the
difficulties
produced
by
the
hostility
of
on
i
gave
to
the
treasury
my
opinion
on
the
first
proposal
for
a
large
reflector
in
australia
it
was
not
strongly
in
august
being
with
my
wife
and
otto
struve
on
a
visit
to
lady
breadalbane
at
taymouth
castle
i
examined
the
mountain
as
in
other
years
i
reported
on
several
papers
for
the
royal
society
and
took
part
in
various
business
for
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
i
had
much
official
business
as
in
march
i
communicated
to
the
athenaeum
my
views
on
the
exodus
of
the
israelites
this
brought
me
into
correspondence
with
miss
corbaux
robert
stephenson
capt
vetch
and
in
december
i
went
to
the
london
custom
house
to
see
sir
freemantle
chairman
of
customs
and
to
see
how
far
decimal
subdivisions
were
used
in
the
custom
house
of
private
history
from
mar
to
i
was
on
an
expedition
to
folkestone
dover
dungeness
from
apr
to
at
playford
and
again
for
short
periods
in
june
and
from
to
i
was
travelling
in
scotland
with
my
wife
and
otto
struve
for
part
of
the
time
at
edinburgh
i
attended
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
and
spoke
a
little
in
section
i
was
nominated
president
for
at
ipswich
we
travelled
to
cape
wrath
and
returned
by
inverness
and
the
caledonian
i
was
at
playford
for
a
short
time
in
october
and
december
in
this
year
the
great
shed
was
built
first
erected
on
the
magnetic
ground
and
about
the
year
transferred
to
the
south
ground
the
chronometers
were
taken
from
the
old
chronometer
room
a
room
on
the
upper
story
fronting
the
south
now
called
library
and
were
put
in
the
room
above
the
computing
room
where
they
remained
for
or
years
i
think
it
had
a
with
erected
in
the
following
passage
is
quoted
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
regards
meridional
astronomy
our
equipment
may
now
be
considered
complete
as
i
have
stated
above
an
improvement
might
yet
be
made
in
our
transit
circle
nevertheless
i
do
not
hesitate
to
express
my
belief
that
no
other
existing
meridional
instrument
can
be
compared
with
it
this
presumed
excellence
has
not
been
obtained
without
much
thought
on
my
part
and
much
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
constructors
of
the
instrument
messrs
ransomes
and
may
and
mr
simms
but
it
would
be
very
unjust
to
omit
the
further
statement
that
the
expense
of
the
construction
has
considerably
exceeded
the
original
estimate
and
that
this
excess
has
been
most
liberally
defrayed
by
the
government
in
december
sir
john
herschel
gave
his
opinion
to
the
admiralty
i
believe
in
favour
of
procuring
for
the
cape
observatory
a
transit
circle
similar
to
that
at
i
had
much
correspondence
about
sending
pierce
morton
formerly
a
pupil
of
mine
at
cambridge
a
clever
gentlemanly
man
and
a
high
wrangler
but
somewhat
flighty
as
magnetic
assistant
to
the
cape
observatory
he
was
with
me
from
may
to
october
and
arrived
at
the
cape
on
nov
i
was
much
engaged
with
the
clock
with
conical
motion
of
pendulum
for
uniform
movement
of
the
chronographic
regarding
galvanic
communications
on
i
had
prepared
a
draft
of
agreement
with
the
south
eastern
railway
company
to
which
they
agreed
in
november
i
wrote
to
sir
baring
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
to
the
admiralty
for
sanction
which
was
given
on
in
december
i
had
various
communications
about
laying
wires
through
the
park
and
correspondence
about
the
possibility
of
using
sympathetic
clocks
in
june
apparently
i
had
seen
shepherd
sympathetic
clock
at
the
great
exhibition
and
had
seen
the
system
of
sympathetic
clocks
at
pawson
st
paul
in
the
last
quarter
of
this
year
i
was
engaged
in
a
series
of
calculations
of
chronological
eclipses
on
mr
bosanquet
wrote
to
me
about
the
eclipse
of
thales
and
i
urged
on
the
computations
related
to
it
through
mr
breen
in
october
the
eclipse
of
agathocles
the
critical
eclipse
for
the
motion
of
the
moon
node
was
going
on
in
october
hansteen
referred
me
to
the
darkness
at
i
went
to
sweden
to
observe
the
total
eclipse
of
july
having
received
assistance
from
the
admiralty
for
the
journeys
of
myself
mr
dunkin
mr
humphreys
and
his
friend
and
capt
blackwood
i
had
prepared
a
map
of
its
track
in
which
an
important
error
of
the
arising
from
neglect
of
the
earth
oblateness
was
corrected
i
gave
a
lecture
at
the
royal
institution
in
preparation
for
the
eclipse
and
drew
up
suggestions
for
observations
and
i
prepared
a
scheme
of
observations
for
greenwich
but
the
weather
was
bad
the
official
account
of
the
observations
of
the
eclipse
with
diagrams
and
conclusions
is
given
in
full
in
a
paper
published
in
the
royal
astr
this
year
i
was
president
of
the
british
association
at
the
ipswich
meeting
it
necessarily
produced
a
great
deal
of
business
i
lectured
one
evening
on
the
coming
eclipse
prince
albert
was
present
as
guest
of
sir
william
middleton
i
was
engaged
to
meet
him
at
dinner
but
when
i
found
that
the
dinner
day
was
one
of
the
principal
soirée
days
i
broke
off
the
on
may
i
had
the
first
letter
from
hamilton
whom
i
had
known
at
cambridge
regarding
the
selection
of
professors
for
the
university
of
sydney
herschel
maldon
and
denison
were
named
as
my
coadjutors
plenty
of
work
was
done
but
it
was
not
finished
till
in
connection
with
the
clock
for
westminster
palace
in
february
there
were
considerations
about
providing
other
clocks
for
the
various
buildings
and
this
probably
was
one
reason
for
my
examining
shepherd
clocks
at
the
great
exhibition
and
at
pawson
in
november
i
first
proposed
that
mr
denison
should
be
associated
with
me
about
the
end
of
the
year
the
plan
of
the
tower
was
supplied
to
me
with
reference
to
the
suspension
of
the
weights
and
other
in
admiral
dundas
for
greenwich
and
one
of
the
board
of
admiralty
had
requested
me
to
aid
the
trustees
of
the
dee
navigation
against
an
attack
and
on
mar
i
went
to
chester
to
see
the
state
of
the
river
on
i
went
to
give
evidence
at
the
official
at
a
discussion
on
the
construction
of
the
great
exhibition
building
in
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
i
expressed
myself
strongly
on
the
faulty
principles
of
its
in
this
year
i
wrote
my
first
paper
on
the
landing
of
julius
caesar
in
britain
and
was
engaged
in
investigations
of
the
geography
tides
sands
relating
to
the
subject
of
private
history
i
was
several
times
at
playford
during
january
and
went
there
again
on
dec
in
this
year
a
very
heavy
misfortune
fell
on
us
my
daughter
elizabeth
had
been
on
a
visit
to
lady
herschel
at
hawkhurst
and
on
apr
sir
herschel
wrote
to
me
saying
that
she
was
so
well
in
health
she
returned
a
few
days
later
and
from
her
appearance
i
was
sure
that
she
was
suffering
under
deadly
disease
after
some
time
an
able
physician
was
consulted
who
at
once
pronounced
it
to
be
pulmonary
a
sea
voyage
was
thought
desirable
and
my
wife
took
her
to
shetland
where
there
was
again
a
kind
welcome
from
mr
edmonston
but
this
and
the
care
taken
on
her
return
availed
nothing
and
it
was
determined
to
take
her
to
madeira
my
wife
and
daughter
sailed
in
the
brig
from
southampton
on
the
termination
came
in
on
i
went
to
bradfield
near
bury
my
uncle
george
biddell
died
and
i
attended
the
funeral
on
nov
from
july
to
i
was
in
sweden
for
the
observation
of
the
eclipse
and
returned
through
in
october
i
was
about
a
week
at
ventnor
and
torquay
and
from
to
at
southampton
on
matters
connected
with
my
daughter
illness
the
following
extracts
are
from
letters
to
his
wife
relating
to
the
observation
of
the
eclipse
his
interview
with
the
king
of
sweden
and
his
visit
to
the
pumping
engines
at
haarlem
the
weather
is
at
present
most
perfectly
doubtful
nearly
the
whole
sky
is
closely
covered
yet
there
is
now
and
then
a
momentary
gleam
of
sun
the
chances
are
greatly
against
much
of
the
eclipse
being
seen
all
is
arranged
to
carry
off
the
telescope
at
they
can
be
carted
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
we
have
made
out
a
then
to
the
top
we
are
to
dine
with
mr
dickson
afterwards
at
well
we
have
had
a
glorious
day
as
soon
as
we
started
the
weather
began
to
look
better
we
went
up
the
hill
and
planted
my
telescope
and
the
sky
shewed
a
large
proportion
of
blue
at
first
i
placed
the
telescope
on
the
highest
rock
but
the
wind
blew
almost
a
gale
and
shook
it
slightly
so
i
descended
about
feet
to
one
side
the
power
of
doing
this
was
one
of
the
elements
in
my
choice
of
this
station
which
made
me
prefer
it
to
the
high
hill
beyond
the
river
the
view
of
scenery
was
inexpressibly
beautiful
the
beginning
of
eclipse
was
well
seen
the
sky
gradually
thickened
from
that
time
so
that
the
sun
was
in
whitish
cloud
at
the
totality
and
barely
visible
in
dense
cloud
at
the
end
of
the
eclipse
the
progress
of
the
eclipse
brought
on
the
wonderful
changes
that
you
know
just
before
the
totality
i
saw
a
large
piece
of
blue
sky
become
pitch
black
the
horror
of
totality
was
very
great
and
then
flashed
into
existence
i
do
not
know
how
a
broad
irregular
corona
with
red
flames
of
the
most
fantastic
kind
the
darkness
was
such
that
my
assistant
had
very
great
trouble
in
reading
his
box
chronometer
a
explanatory
diagram
is
here
given
some
important
points
are
made
out
from
this
the
red
flames
certainly
belong
to
the
sun
they
certainly
are
in
some
instances
detached
they
are
sometimes
quite
crooked
they
seem
to
be
connected
with
spots
the
corona
was
brilliant
white
one
star
brilliant
i
believe
venus
i
had
no
time
to
make
observations
of
polarization
although
prepared
when
the
totality
was
more
than
half
over
i
looked
to
and
and
in
these
regions
there
was
the
fullest
rosy
light
after
the
reappeared
the
black
shadow
went
travelling
away
to
the
exactly
like
the
from
the
main
the
day
then
grew
worse
and
we
came
home
here
after
dinner
in
pouring
rain
stockholm
i
then
by
appointment
with
sir
edmund
lyons
went
with
him
to
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
baron
stjerneld
who
received
me
most
civilly
my
business
was
to
thank
him
for
the
orders
which
had
been
given
to
facilitate
the
landing
of
our
telescopes
he
was
quite
familiar
with
the
names
of
my
party
humphreys
milaud
so
that
i
trust
they
have
been
well
received
i
have
had
no
letter
he
intimated
i
suppose
at
sir
lyons
suggestion
that
perhaps
king
oscar
might
wish
to
see
me
but
that
it
would
not
be
on
tuesday
so
i
replied
that
i
was
infinitely
flattered
and
he
said
that
he
would
send
a
message
to
sir
lyons
by
tuesday
evening
now
all
this
put
me
in
a
quandary
because
i
wanted
to
see
upsala
miles
off
and
the
steamboats
on
the
mälar
only
go
in
the
morning
and
return
in
the
morning
and
this
was
irreconcileable
with
waiting
for
his
appointment
which
might
be
for
wednesday
morning
so
after
consultation
sir
lyons
put
me
in
the
hands
of
a
sort
of
courier
attached
to
the
embassy
and
he
procured
a
calèche
and
i
posted
to
upsala
yesterday
afternoon
knocking
the
people
up
at
at
night
and
posted
back
this
afternoon
and
sure
enough
a
message
has
come
that
the
king
expects
me
at
morning
posting
of
course
is
much
dearer
than
travelling
but
it
is
cheap
in
comparison
with
england
two
horses
cost
for
nearly
miles
at
upsala
there
is
a
very
good
old
cathedral
i
suppose
the
only
one
in
sweden
and
many
things
about
the
university
which
interested
me
i
sent
my
card
to
professor
fries
and
he
entirely
devoted
himself
to
me
but
imagine
our
conversation
he
spoke
in
and
i
in
french
however
we
understood
each
other
very
well
it
is
on
the
whole
a
dreary
country
except
where
enlivened
by
lakes
some
parts
are
pine
forests
and
birch
forests
but
others
are
featureless
ground
with
boulder
stones
like
the
worst
part
of
the
highlands
wednesday
i
rigged
myself
in
black
trowsers
and
white
waistcoat
and
neckcloth
this
morning
sir
edmund
lyons
called
baron
wrede
called
on
me
he
had
observed
the
eclipse
at
calmar
and
brought
his
drawing
much
like
mine
he
conducted
me
to
the
palace
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
came
to
me
in
the
i
was
introduced
to
the
of
christianstad
who
had
had
the
charge
of
humphreys
and
milaud
he
had
placed
a
of
round
them
while
they
were
observing
they
saw
the
eclipse
well
captain
blackwood
went
to
helsingborg
instead
of
bornholm
and
saw
well
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
it
was
cloudy
at
christiania
mr
station
i
heard
some
days
ago
that
hind
had
lost
his
telescope
but
i
now
heard
a
very
different
story
that
he
landed
at
ystad
and
found
a
very
bad
hotel
there
that
he
learnt
from
murray
that
the
hotels
at
carlscrona
or
wherever
he
meant
to
go
were
much
worse
and
so
he
grew
faint
at
heart
and
turned
back
i
was
summoned
in
to
the
king
and
presented
by
the
minister
stjerneld
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
on
the
eclipse
the
arc
of
meridian
the
languages
and
the
universities
we
spoke
in
french
then
baron
wrede
went
with
me
to
the
rittershus
house
of
lords
or
nobles
in
session
and
to
the
gallery
of
scandinavian
antiquities
which
is
very
remarkable
the
collection
of
stone
axes
and
chisels
bronze
iron
ornaments
is
quite
amazing
i
was
struck
with
seeing
specimens
from
a
very
distant
age
of
the
maid
of
norway
brooch
the
use
of
which
i
explained
to
the
director
i
dined
and
drove
out
with
sir
lyons
and
called
at
the
houses
of
the
baron
stjerneld
and
of
the
norwegian
minister
baron
duë
and
had
tea
at
the
latter
most
of
these
people
speak
english
well
and
they
seem
to
live
in
a
very
domestic
family
style
i
should
soon
be
quite
at
home
here
for
i
perceive
that
my
reception
at
court
make
people
think
that
i
am
a
very
proper
sort
of
person
the
extract
concerning
his
visit
to
the
at
haarlem
is
as
follows
leyden
august
i
went
to
see
the
great
north
holland
canal
and
went
a
mile
or
two
in
a
upon
it
a
very
comfortable
conveyance
saw
windmills
used
for
sawing
timber
and
other
purposes
as
well
as
some
for
grinding
and
many
for
draining
yesterday
at
one
i
went
by
railway
to
haarlem
i
did
not
look
at
anything
in
the
town
except
going
through
it
and
seeing
that
it
is
a
curious
fantastic
place
but
i
drove
at
once
to
the
burgomaster
to
ask
permission
to
visit
one
of
the
three
great
pumping
engines
for
draining
the
immense
haarlem
lake
and
then
drove
to
it
imagine
a
round
tower
with
a
in
its
center
and
the
piston
which
works
instead
of
working
one
great
beam
as
they
usually
do
works
poking
out
on
different
sides
of
the
round
tower
and
each
driving
a
pump
feet
in
diameter
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
it
then
by
railway
here
galvanic
communication
was
now
established
with
lewisham
station
thus
giving
power
of
communicating
with
london
deal
from
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
it
appears
that
in
the
case
of
the
transit
circle
the
azimuth
of
the
instrument
as
determined
by
opposite
passages
of
the
pole
star
had
varied
four
seconds
and
in
the
case
of
the
altazimuth
there
was
a
discordance
in
the
azimuthal
zeros
of
the
instrument
as
determined
from
observations
of
stars
in
both
cases
it
was
concluded
that
the
discordances
arose
from
small
movements
of
the
under
the
head
of
remarks
in
the
report
the
following
paragraph
occurs
will
be
perceived
that
the
number
of
equatoreal
observations
made
here
at
present
is
small
and
that
they
are
rarely
directed
to
new
comets
and
similar
objects
which
sometimes
excite
considerable
interest
this
omission
is
intentional
it
is
not
because
the
instrumental
means
are
wanting
for
our
equatoreals
though
not
comparable
to
those
of
either
cambridge
or
of
pulkowa
are
fully
equal
to
those
usually
directed
to
such
objects
but
it
is
because
these
observations
are
most
abundantly
supplied
from
other
observatories
public
and
private
and
because
the
gain
to
those
observations
from
our
taking
a
part
in
them
would
probably
be
far
less
than
the
loss
to
the
important
class
of
observations
which
we
can
otherwise
follow
so
well
moreover
i
am
unwilling
to
take
any
step
which
could
be
interpreted
as
attempting
to
deprive
the
local
and
private
observatories
of
honours
which
they
have
so
nobly
earned
and
finally
in
this
act
of
abstinence
i
am
desirous
of
giving
an
example
of
adhesion
to
one
principle
which
i
am
confident
might
be
extensively
followed
with
great
advantage
to
astronomy
the
principle
of
division
of
labour
discoveries
of
small
planets
were
now
not
infrequent
but
the
only
one
of
interest
to
me
is
melpomene
for
the
following
reason
on
june
i
lost
my
most
dear
amiable
clever
daughter
elizabeth
she
died
at
southampton
two
days
after
landing
from
madeira
on
that
evening
mr
hind
discovered
the
planet
and
he
requested
me
to
give
a
name
i
remembered
horace
lugubres
cantus
melpomene
and
cowley
called
the
buskin
muse
melpomene
and
told
her
what
sad
story
i
would
write
and
suggested
melpomene
or
penthos
melpomene
was
the
first
move
about
the
deal
time
ball
was
in
a
letter
from
commander
baldock
to
the
admiralty
suggesting
that
a
time
ball
dropped
by
galvanic
current
from
greenwich
should
be
attached
to
one
of
the
south
foreland
lighthouses
the
admiralty
sent
this
for
my
report
i
went
to
the
place
and
i
suggested
in
reply
that
a
better
place
would
be
at
an
old
signal
station
on
the
chalk
downs
the
decisive
change
from
this
was
made
in
as
the
result
of
my
examination
and
enquiries
into
the
subject
of
sympathetic
clocks
i
established
sympathetic
clocks
in
the
royal
observatory
one
of
which
outside
the
entrance
gate
had
a
large
dial
with
shepherd
name
as
patentee
exception
was
taken
to
this
by
the
solicitor
of
a
mr
bain
who
had
busied
himself
about
galvanic
clocks
after
much
correspondence
i
agreed
to
remove
shepherd
name
till
bain
had
legally
established
his
claim
this
however
was
never
done
and
in
shepherd
name
was
in
denison
had
consented
to
join
me
in
the
preparation
of
the
westminster
clock
in
we
began
to
have
little
disagreements
however
on
apr
i
was
going
to
madeira
and
requested
him
to
act
with
full
powers
from
i
communicated
to
the
royal
society
my
paper
on
the
eclipses
of
agathocles
thales
and
in
the
british
association
i
had
presided
at
the
ipswich
meeting
in
and
according
to
custom
i
ought
to
attend
at
the
meeting
held
at
belfast
to
resign
my
office
but
i
was
broken
in
spirit
by
the
death
of
my
daughter
and
the
thing
generally
was
beyond
my
willing
enterprise
i
requested
sir
roderick
murchison
to
act
generally
for
me
which
he
did
as
i
understood
very
in
this
year
a
proposal
was
made
by
the
government
for
shifting
all
the
meeting
rooms
of
the
scientific
societies
to
kensington
gore
which
was
stoutly
resisted
by
all
and
was
finally
abandoned
of
private
history
i
was
at
playford
in
january
and
went
thence
to
chester
on
the
enquiry
about
the
tides
of
the
dee
and
made
excursions
to
halton
castle
and
to
from
apr
to
may
i
was
on
the
voyage
to
and
from
madeira
and
on
a
short
visit
to
my
wife
and
daughter
on
june
i
went
to
southampton
to
meet
my
wife
and
daughter
just
landed
from
madeira
on
june
my
dear
daughter
elizabeth
died
she
was
buried
at
playford
on
june
i
was
at
playford
also
in
july
and
from
to
i
went
to
cumberland
viâ
fleetwood
and
peel
on
may
i
issued
an
address
to
the
individual
members
of
the
board
of
visitors
proposing
the
extension
of
the
lunar
reductions
from
from
this
it
appears
that
the
whole
period
from
to
the
places
of
the
moon
deduced
from
the
observations
are
compared
with
the
places
computed
in
the
nautical
almanac
that
is
with
burckhardt
tables
which
have
been
used
for
many
years
in
computing
the
places
of
the
nautical
almanac
lately
however
mr
adams
has
shewn
that
burckhardt
parallax
is
erroneous
in
formula
and
is
numerically
incorrect
sometimes
to
the
amount
of
seven
seconds
in
consequence
of
this
every
reduction
of
the
observations
of
the
moon
from
to
the
present
time
is
sensibly
erroneous
and
the
error
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
is
not
easy
in
general
to
introduce
its
correction
by
any
simple
process
the
number
of
observations
to
the
end
of
after
which
time
the
parallax
will
be
corrected
in
the
current
reductions
is
about
an
expense
approaching
to
might
be
incurred
in
their
reduction
subsequently
i
made
application
to
the
admiralty
and
the
was
granted
on
dec
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
it
is
stated
that
with
regard
to
the
transit
circle
changes
are
under
contemplation
in
its
one
of
these
changes
relates
to
the
material
of
the
trough
years
ago
when
i
was
at
hamburgh
my
revered
friend
schumacher
exhibited
to
me
the
pacifying
effect
of
a
copper
dish
whose
surface
had
been
previously
amalgamated
with
quicksilver
rev
charles
pritchard
has
lately
given
much
attention
to
this
curious
property
of
the
metals
and
has
brought
the
practical
operation
of
amalgamation
to
great
perfection
still
it
is
not
without
difficulty
on
account
of
a
singular
crystallization
of
the
amalgam
with
regard
to
the
chronograph
the
report
states
barrel
apparatus
for
the
american
method
of
observing
transits
is
not
yet
brought
into
use
i
have
however
brought
it
to
such
a
state
that
i
am
beginning
to
try
whether
the
barrel
moves
with
sufficient
uniformity
to
be
itself
used
as
the
transit
clock
this
if
perfectly
secured
would
be
a
very
great
convenience
but
i
am
not
very
sanguine
on
that
point
a
change
had
been
made
in
the
wire
for
the
collection
of
atmospheric
electricity
is
now
stretched
from
a
chimney
on
the
angle
of
the
leads
of
the
octagon
room
to
the
electrometer
pole
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
a
greater
amount
of
electricity
is
collected
by
this
apparatus
than
by
that
formerly
in
use
as
regards
the
magnetical
observations
visitors
at
their
last
meeting
expressed
a
wish
that
some
attempt
should
be
made
to
proceed
further
in
the
reduction
or
digest
of
the
magnetical
results
if
any
satisfactory
plan
could
be
devised
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
yet
satisfied
myself
on
the
propriety
of
any
special
plan
that
i
have
examined
i
must
however
confess
that
in
viewing
the
capricious
forms
of
the
photographic
curves
my
mind
is
entirely
bewildered
and
i
sometimes
doubt
the
possibility
of
extracting
from
them
anything
whatever
which
can
be
considered
trustworthy
great
progress
had
been
made
with
the
distribution
of
time
same
normal
clock
maintains
in
sympathetic
movement
the
large
clock
at
the
entrance
gate
two
other
clocks
in
the
observatory
and
a
clock
at
the
london
bridge
terminus
of
the
railway
it
sends
galvanic
signals
every
day
along
all
the
principal
railways
diverging
from
london
it
drops
the
greenwich
ball
and
the
ball
on
the
offices
of
the
electric
telegraph
company
in
the
strand
all
these
various
effects
are
produced
without
sensible
error
of
time
and
i
can
not
but
feel
a
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
the
royal
observatory
is
thus
quietly
contributing
to
the
punctuality
of
business
through
a
large
portion
of
this
busy
country
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
stating
to
the
visitors
that
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
have
decided
on
the
erection
of
a
ball
at
deal
for
the
use
of
the
shipping
in
the
downs
to
be
dropped
every
day
by
a
galvanic
current
from
the
royal
observatory
the
construction
of
the
apparatus
is
entrusted
to
me
probably
there
is
no
roadstead
in
the
world
in
which
the
knowledge
of
true
time
is
so
important
the
report
includes
an
account
of
the
determination
of
the
longitude
of
cambridge
observatory
by
means
of
galvanic
signals
which
appear
to
have
been
perfectly
under
the
head
of
general
remarks
the
following
passage
appears
system
of
combining
the
labour
of
unattached
computers
with
that
of
attached
assistants
tends
materially
to
strengthen
our
powers
in
everything
relating
to
computation
we
find
also
among
the
young
persons
who
are
engaged
merely
to
serve
as
computers
a
most
laudable
ambition
to
distinguish
themselves
as
observers
and
thus
we
are
always
prepared
to
undertake
any
observations
which
may
be
required
although
necessarily
by
an
expenditure
of
strength
which
would
usually
be
employed
on
some
other
work
considerable
work
was
undertaken
in
preparing
a
new
set
of
maps
of
our
buildings
and
on
apr
there
was
a
small
fire
in
the
magnetic
observatory
which
did
little
in
december
i
wrote
my
description
of
the
transit
lieut
stratford
the
editor
of
the
nautical
almanac
died
and
there
was
some
competition
for
the
office
i
was
willing
to
take
it
at
a
low
rate
for
the
addition
to
my
salary
mr
main
and
i
think
mr
glaisher
were
desirous
of
exchanging
to
it
adams
was
anxious
for
it
the
admiralty
made
the
excellent
choice
of
mr
in
october
faraday
and
i
at
lothbury
witnessed
some
remarkable
experiments
by
mr
latimer
clark
on
a
galvanic
current
carried
four
times
to
and
from
manchester
by
subterranean
wires
more
than
miles
shewing
the
retardation
of
visible
currents
at
their
maximum
effect
and
the
concentration
of
active
power
i
made
investigations
of
the
velocity
of
the
galvanic
i
was
engaged
on
the
preliminary
enquiries
and
arrangements
for
the
deal
time
with
respect
to
the
westminster
clock
an
angry
paper
was
issued
by
mr
vulliamy
in
october
i
expostulated
with
denison
about
his
conduct
towards
sir
charles
barry
on
november
i
on
i
was
elected
president
of
the
royal
astronomical
in
the
royal
institution
i
lectured
on
the
ancient

i
was
elected
to
the
academy
of
after
preliminary
correspondence
with
sir
molesworth
first
commissioner
of
works
and
sir
charles
barry
architect
of
the
westminster
palace
i
wrote
on
may
to
mr
gladstone
about
depositing
the
four
parliamentary
copies
of
standards
at
the
royal
observatory
the
royal
mint
the
royal
society
and
within
a
wall
of
westminster
palace
mr
gladstone
assented
on
june
on
mar
i
wrote
to
mr
gladstone
proposing
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
copper
coinage
for
introducing
the
decimal
system
i
was
always
strenuous
about
preserving
the
pound
sterling
on
may
i
attended
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
on
decimal
coinage
and
in
may
and
september
i
wrote
letters
to
the
athenaeum
on
decimal
i
had
always
something
on
hand
about
tides
a
special
subject
now
was
the
cry
about
intercepting
the
tidal
waters
of
the
tyne
by
the
formation
of
the
jarrow
docks
in
jarrow
slake
which
fear
i
considered
to
be
ridiculous
of
private
history
from
to
i
was
at
on
mar
i
went
to
dover
to
try
from
june
to
i
was
at
little
braithwaite
near
keswick
where
i
had
hired
a
house
and
made
expeditions
with
members
of
my
family
in
all
directions
on
july
i
went
with
my
son
wilfrid
by
workington
and
maryport
to
rose
castle
the
residence
of
bishop
percy
the
bishop
of
carlisle
and
on
to
carlisle
and
newcastle
looking
at
various
works
mines
on
i
went
to
playford
the
chronograph
for
the
american
method
of
transits
had
been
practically
brought
into
use
i
have
only
to
add
that
this
apparatus
is
now
generally
efficient
it
is
troublesome
in
use
consuming
much
time
in
the
galvanic
preparations
the
preparation
of
the
paper
and
the
translation
of
the
into
figures
but
among
the
observers
who
use
it
there
is
but
one
opinion
on
its
astronomical
merits
that
in
freedom
from
personal
equation
and
in
general
accuracy
it
is
very
far
superior
to
the
observations
by
eye
and
ear
the
printing
and
publication
of
the
observations
which
was
always
regarded
by
airy
as
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
had
fallen
into
arrear
i
stated
in
my
last
report
that
the
printing
of
the
observations
for
was
scarcely
commenced
at
the
time
of
the
last
meeting
of
the
visitors
for
a
long
time
the
printing
went
on
so
slowly
that
i
almost
despaired
of
ever
again
seeing
the
observations
in
a
creditable
state
after
a
most
harassing
correspondence
the
printers
were
at
length
persuaded
to
move
more
actively
but
the
volume
is
still
very
much
behind
its
usual
time
of
publication
the
deal
has
now
been
erected
by
messrs
maudslays
and
field
and
is
an
admirable
specimen
of
the
workmanship
of
those
celebrated
engineers
the
galvanic
connection
with
the
royal
observatory
through
the
telegraph
wires
of
the
south
eastern
railway
is
perfect
the
automatic
changes
of
are
so
arranged
that
when
the
ball
at
deal
has
dropped
to
its
lowest
point
it
sends
a
message
to
greenwich
to
acquaint
me
not
with
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
its
fall
which
can
not
be
in
error
but
with
the
fact
that
it
has
really
fallen
the
ball
has
several
times
been
dropped
experimentally
with
perfect
success
and
some
small
official
and
subsidiary
arrangements
alone
are
wanting
for
bringing
it
into
constant
use
the
operations
for
the
galvanic
determination
of
the
longitude
of
brussels
are
described
with
the
following
conclusion
thus
about
effective
signals
were
made
but
only
of
these
were
admissible
for
the
fundamental
objects
of
the
operation
the
result
i
need
scarcely
remark
claims
a
degree
of
accuracy
to
which
no
preceding
determination
of
longitude
could
ever
pretend
i
apprehend
that
the
probable
error
in
the
difference
of
time
corresponds
to
not
more
than
one
or
two
yards
upon
the
earth
a
careful
scheme
had
been
arranged
for
the
determination
of
the
longitude
of
lerwick
but
the
demand
for
chronometers
caused
by
our
large
naval
armament
has
been
so
considerable
that
i
can
not
reckon
on
having
at
my
disposal
a
sufficient
number
to
carry
on
this
operation
successfully
and
i
have
therefore
unwillingly
deferred
it
to
a
more
peaceful
time
the
covering
stone
of
halley
tomb
in
lee
churchyard
was
much
shattered
and
i
applied
to
the
admiralty
for
funds
for
its
complete
restoration
these
were
granted
on
feb
in
this
year
under
my
cognizance
was
added
to
the
hansen
i
had
much
correspondence
and
work
in
connection
with
the
printing
of
work
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
june
all
accounts
about
the
transit
circle
were
closed
at
the
admiralty
and
the
instrument
was
completely
mounted
at
the
dr
scoresby
who
in
his
own
way
was
very
imperious
had
attacked
my
methods
of
correcting
the
compass
in
iron
ships
i
replied
in
a
letter
to
the
athenaeum
on
oct
i
made
enquiries
about
operations
for
determining
the
longitude
of
vienna
but
was
utterly
repelled
by
the
foreign
telegraph
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
i
prepared
the
address
on
presenting
the
medal
to
in
melbourne
university
the
first
letter
received
was
from
the
chancellor
of
the
university
dated
requesting
that
sir
john
herschel
malden
mr
lowe
subsequently
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
i
would
select
professors
we
had
a
great
deal
of
correspondence
meetings
examination
of
testimonials
and
on
august
we
agreed
on
wilson
rowe
mccoy
and
on
i
received
the
prussian
order
of
i
had
correspondence
with
the
treasury
on
the
scale
to
be
adopted
for
the
maps
of
the
british
survey
i
proposed
and
for
some
purposes
i
printed
a
paper
on
the
deluge
in
which
i
shewed
i
believe
to
certainty
that
the
deluge
of
genesis
was
merely
a
destructive
flood
of
the
being
well
acquainted
with
the
mountains
of
cumberland
i
had
remarked
that
a
or
cairn
of
stones
erected
by
the
ordnance
surveyors
on
the
great
gable
had
covered
up
a
curious
natural
stone
trough
known
as
one
of
the
remarkable
singularities
of
the
country
this
year
without
giving
any
notice
to
the
ordnance
surveyors
i
sent
two
wallers
from
borrowdale
to
the
mountain
top
to
remove
the
about
feet
and
expose
the
trough
sir
henry
james
afterwards
approved
of
my
act
and
refunded
the
i
investigated
the
optical
condition
of
an
eye
with
conical
cornea
the
harton
colliery
experiment
i
had
long
wished
to
repeat
the
experiment
which
i
had
attempted
unsuccessfully
in
and
of
determining
by
the
measure
of
gravity
at
the
bottom
of
a
mine
residing
near
keswick
this
summer
and
having
the
matter
in
my
mind
i
availed
myself
of
an
introduction
from
dr
leitch
to
some
gentlemen
at
south
shields
for
inspection
of
the
harton
colliery
i
judged
that
it
would
answer
pretty
well
i
find
that
on
i
wrote
to
mr
anderson
lessee
of
the
mine
and
on
the
same
day
to
the
admiralty
requesting
authority
to
employ
a
greenwich
assistant
and
requesting
for
part
payment
of
expenses
on
august
the
admiralty
assent
there
were
many
preparations
to
be
made
both
personal
and
instrumental
my
party
consisted
of
dunkin
superintendant
ellis
criswick
simmons
pogson
and
rümker
i
did
not
myself
attend
the
detail
of
observations
the
observations
began
on
and
ended
on
supplementary
observations
were
subsequently
made
at
greenwich
for
examining
the
coefficient
of
on
i
gave
a
lecture
at
south
shields
on
the
whole
operation
in
of
there
was
an
excellent
account
of
the
experiment
which
as
i
afterwards
found
was
written
by
mr
percival
leigh
of
private
history
on
i
returned
from
playford
from
mar
to
i
was
at
deal
and
visited
sir
john
herschel
at
from
june
to
i
was
staying
with
my
family
at
the
grange
in
borrowdale
near
keswick
and
also
made
an
expedition
to
penrith
carlisle
newcastle
jarrow
and
descended
the
harton
in
september
and
also
in
october
i
was
at
south
shields
on
the
harton
from
to
i
was
at
cambridge
and
on
the
i
went
to
playford
the
following
letter
written
in
answer
to
a
lady
who
had
asked
him
to
procure
permission
from
lord
rosse
for
her
to
observe
with
his
telescope
is
characteristic
royal
observatory
greenwich
september
dear
madam
the
state
of
things
with
regard
to
lord
rosse
telescope
is
this
if
a
night
is
fine
it
is
wanted
for
his
use
or
for
the
use
of
professional
astronomers
if
it
is
not
fine
it
is
of
no
use
to
anybody
now
considering
this
and
considering
that
the
appropriation
of
the
telescope
on
a
fine
night
to
any
body
but
a
technical
astronomer
is
a
misapplication
of
an
enormous
capital
of
money
and
intellect
which
is
invested
in
this
unique
instrument
it
is
against
my
conscience
to
ask
lord
rosse
to
place
it
at
the
service
of
any
person
except
an
experienced
astronomer
no
introduction
i
believe
is
necessary
for
seeing
it
in
the
the
instrument
stands
unenclosed
in
the
castle
demesne
to
which
strangers
are
admitted
without
question
i
believe
faithfully
yours
airy
on
may
it
was
notified
to
me
i
think
through
the
hydrographer
that
the
admiralty
were
not
unwilling
to
increase
my
salary
i
made
application
therefore
and
on
sir
charles
wood
notified
to
me
that
the
admiralty
consented
to
have
it
raised
from
to
in
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
it
appears
that
the
instance
of
the
board
of
trade
acting
on
this
occasion
through
a
committee
of
the
royal
society
a
model
of
the
transit
circle
with
the
improvement
of
perforated
cube
introduced
in
the
cape
transit
circle
has
been
prepared
for
the
great
exhibition
at
paris
under
the
head
of
reduction
of
astronomical
observations
it
is
stated
that
the
whole
time
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
method
has
been
employed
for
transits
with
the
exception
of
a
few
days
when
the
galvanic
apparatus
was
out
of
order
from
the
clock
errors
i
have
deduced
the
personal
equations
of
the
observers
in
our
usual
way
the
result
is
that
the
magnitude
of
the
personal
equations
in
the
method
is
not
above
half
of
that
in
the
eye
and
ear
method
with
regard
to
the
reduction
of
the
magnetical
observations
have
not
yet
felt
sufficiently
satisfied
with
any
proposed
method
of
discussing
the
magnetic
results
to
devote
any
time
to
their
further
treatment
ball
at
deal
was
brought
into
regular
use
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
year
in
a
short
time
however
its
action
was
interrupted
partly
by
derangement
of
the
apparatus
and
partly
by
the
severity
of
the
weather
which
froze
the
sulphuric
acid
to
the
state
of
jelly
i
sent
an
assistant
and
workman
to
put
it
in
order
and
since
that
time
it
has
generally
acted
very
application
has
been
made
to
me
from
one
of
the
important
offices
of
government
the
post
office
for
the
galvanic
regulation
of
their
on
considering
the
risks
to
which
various
galvanic
communications
are
liable
and
the
financial
necessity
for
occupying
wires
as
little
as
possible
i
perceived
that
it
was
necessary
to
devise
constructions
which
should
satisfy
the
following
conditions
first
that
a
current
sent
once
a
day
should
suffice
for
adjusting
the
clock
even
if
it
had
gone
ten
or
more
seconds
wrong
secondly
that
an
occasional
failure
of
the
current
should
not
stop
the
clock
i
have
arranged
constructions
which
possess
these
characters
and
the
artist
mr
shepherd
is
now
engaged
in
preparing
estimates
of
the
expense
i
think
it
likely
that
this
may
prove
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
very
extensive
system
of
clock
regulation
with
respect
to
the
operations
for
determining
the
longitude
of
paris
it
is
stated
that
the
whole
number
of
days
of
signal
transmission
was
eighteen
and
the
whole
number
of
signals
transmitted
was
the
number
of
days
considered
available
for
longitude
in
consequence
of
transits
of
stars
having
been
observed
at
both
observatories
was
twelve
and
the
number
of
signals
was
very
great
care
was
taken
on
both
sides
for
the
adjustments
of
the
instruments
the
resulting
difference
of
longitude
is
probably
very
accurate
it
is
less
by
nearly
of
time
than
that
determined
in
by
under
the
superintendance
of
sir
john
herschel
and
sabine
the
time
occupied
by
the
passage
of
the
galvanic
current
appears
to
be
of
a
second
with
regard
to
the
pendulum
experiments
in
the
harton
colliery
after
mentioning
that
personal
assistance
had
been
sought
and
obtained
from
the
observatories
of
cambridge
oxford
durham
and
red
hill
the
report
states
that
the
experiments
appear
to
have
been
in
every
point
successful
shewing
beyond
doubt
that
gravity
is
increased
at
the
depth
of
feet
by
part
i
trust
that
this
combination
may
prove
a
valuable
precedent
for
future
associations
of
the
different
observatories
of
the
kingdom
when
objects
requiring
extensive
personal
organization
shall
present
themselves
on
the
astronomer
royal
printed
an
address
to
the
individual
members
of
the
board
of
visitors
on
the
subject
of
a
large
new
equatoreal
for
the
observatory
after
a
brief
statement
of
the
existing
equipment
of
the
observatory
in
respect
of
equatoreal
instruments
the
address
continues
thus
it
is
known
to
the
visitors
that
i
have
uniformly
objected
to
any
luxury
of
extrameridional
apparatus
which
would
materially
divert
us
from
a
steady
adherence
to
the
meridional
system
which
both
reason
and
tradition
have
engrafted
on
this
observatory
but
i
feel
that
our
present
instruments
are
insufficient
even
for
my
wishes
and
i
can
not
overlook
the
consideration
that
due
provision
must
be
made
for
future
interests
and
that
we
are
nearer
by
twenty
years
to
the
time
when
another
judgment
must
decide
on
the
direction
which
shall
be
given
to
the
force
of
the
observatory
in
august
i
had
some
correspondence
about
the
egyptian
wooden
astronomical
tablets
with
mr
gresswell
and
others
they
were
fully
examined
by
mr
in
this
year
i
was
much
engaged
on
schemes
for
compasses
and
in
june
i
sent
my
paper
on
discussions
of
ships
magnetism
to
the
royal
on
the
mast
of
the
observatory
broke
and
the
ball
fell
in
the
front
on
my
valued
friend
mr
sheepshanks
died
and
on
i
went
to
london
to
see
the
standard
bars
as
left
by
him
afterwards
on
i
went
to
reading
to
collect
the
papers
about
standards
left
by
mr
i
made
a
mechanical
construction
for
euclid
i
with
which
i
was
well
on
apr
i
joined
a
deputation
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
sir
cornewall
lewis
on
decimal
coinage
of
private
history
i
was
at
playford
for
a
large
part
of
on
mar
i
went
to
reading
to
visit
mr
sheepshanks
and
afterwards
to
silchester
and
on
june
i
went
with
my
wife
and
two
eldest
sons
to
edinburgh
and
other
places
in
scotland
but
residing
principally
at
oban
where
i
hired
a
house
amongst
other
expeditions
i
and
my
son
wilfrid
went
with
the
northern
lights
steamer
to
the
skerry
vohr
lighthouse
i
also
visited
newcastle
and
returned
to
greenwich
on
aug
from
to
i
was
at
on
i
went
to
playford
chapter
vii
at
greenwich
observatory
to
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
there
is
an
interesting
account
of
the
difficulties
experienced
with
the
reflex
zenith
tube
in
consequence
of
the
tremors
of
the
quicksilver
transmitted
through
the
ground
attempts
were
made
to
reduce
the
tremor
by
supporting
the
quicksilver
trough
on
a
stage
founded
at
a
depth
of
feet
below
the
surface
but
it
was
not
in
the
smallest
degree
diminished
and
the
report
states
that
experience
of
this
investigation
justifies
me
in
believing
that
no
practicable
depth
of
trench
prevents
the
propagation
of
tremor
when
the
soil
is
like
that
of
greenwich
hill
a
gravel
in
all
places
very
hard
and
in
some
cemented
to
the
consistency
of
rock
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
the
post
office
clocks
of
the
galvanic
clocks
in
the
post
office
department
lombard
street
is
already
placed
in
connection
with
the
royal
observatory
and
is
regulated
at
noon
every
day
other
clocks
at
the
general
post
office
are
nearly
prepared
for
the
same
regulation
and
i
expect
that
the
complete
system
will
soon
be
in
action
under
the
head
of
general
remarks
a
careful
summary
is
given
of
the
work
of
the
observatory
and
the
paragraph
concludes
as
follows
there
are
employments
which
connect
the
scientific
observatory
with
the
practical
world
the
distribution
of
accurate
time
the
improvement
of
marine
the
observations
and
communications
which
tend
to
the
advantage
of
geography
and
navigation
and
the
study
in
a
practical
sense
of
the
modifications
of
magnetism
a
careful
attention
to
these
is
likely
to
prove
useful
to
the
world
and
conducive
to
the
material
prosperity
of
the
observatory
and
these
ought
not
to
be
banished
from
our
system
in
september
i
prepared
the
first
specification
for
the
building
to
carry
the
in
september
learning
that
hansen
lunar
tables
were
finished
in
manuscript
i
applied
to
lord
clarendon
and
they
were
conveyed
to
me
through
the
foreign
office
in
october
i
submitted
to
the
admiralty
the
proposal
for
printing
the
tables
and
in
november
i
learned
that
the
treasury
had
assented
to
the
lieut
daynou
eclipses
and
occultations
for
longitudes
of
points
in
south
africa
observed
in
and
were
calculated
here
in
this
on
i
made
my
first
application
to
sir
wood
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
for
assistance
to
piazzi
smyth
to
carry
out
the
teneriffe
experiment
grounding
it
in
part
on
the
failure
of
attempts
to
see
the
solar
prominences
he
gave
encouragement
and
on
mar
i
transmitted
piazzi
smyth
memorial
to
the
admiralty
on
may
the
admiralty
authorized
an
expense
of
i
drew
up
the
sheepshanks
fund
after
the
death
of
my
friend
richard
sheepshanks
his
sister
miss
anne
sheepshanks
wished
to
bestow
some
funds
in
connection
with
the
university
of
cambridge
trinity
college
and
astronomy
to
which
his
name
should
be
attached
there
must
have
been
some
conversation
with
me
but
the
first
letter
is
one
from
de
morgan
in
august
in
september
i
had
a
conversation
with
miss
sheepshanks
and
sent
her
my
first
draft
of
a
scheme
to
which
she
assented
on
i
wrote
to
whewell
master
of
trinity
who
was
much
trusted
by
miss
sheepshanks
he
consented
to
take
part
and
made
some
suggestions
there
was
further
correspondence
but
the
business
did
not
get
into
shape
in
this
in
connection
with
the
correction
of
the
compass
in
iron
ships
i
discussed
the
observations
made
in
the
voyage
of
the
royal
charter
on
i
proposed
to
the
admiralty
a
system
of
mounting
the
compasses
with
adjustable
magnets
and
it
was
ordered
to
be
tried
in
the
trident
and
in
february
i
reported
to
the
admiralty
that
the
deal
had
been
successful
and
i
proposed
at
portsmouth
plymouth
and
sheerness
there
was
much
correspondence
in
various
directions
about
portsmouth
and
devonport
and
in
march
i
went
to
devonport
and
specially
examined
mount
wise
and
the
devonport
i
had
correspondence
with
sir
howard
douglas
about
the
sea
breaking
over
the
unfinished
dover
pier
i
have
an
idea
that
this
followed
evidence
given
by
me
to
a
harbour
commission
in
which
i
expressed
as
a
certainty
that
the
sea
will
not
be
made
to
break
by
a
vertical
wall
of
private
history
i
returned
from
playford
on
jan
from
june
to
august
i
was
with
my
son
wilfrid
on
an
expedition
to
south
italy
and
sicily
on
our
return
from
sicily
we
remained
for
three
days
ill
at
marseilles
from
a
touch
of
on
i
went
to
in
acknowledgment
of
the
pleasure
which
i
had
derived
from
excursions
in
the
cumberland
passes
i
made
a
over
a
troublesome
stream
on
the
pass
of
the
sty
head
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
when
on
the
subject
of
the
altazimuth
the
following
paragraph
occurs
alluded
in
a
preceding
section
to
the
cutting
away
of
a
very
small
portion
of
one
of
the
rays
of
the
pier
which
carries
the
altazimuth
the
quality
of
the
brickwork
is
the
best
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
not
a
single
brick
was
disturbed
beyond
those
actually
removed
yet
the
effect
was
to
give
the
altazimuth
an
inclination
of
about
this
inclination
evidently
depends
on
the
elasticity
of
the
brickwork
with
reference
to
the
new
equatoreal
the
report
states
that
support
of
the
north
or
upper
end
of
the
polar
axis
has
been
received
and
is
planted
within
the
walls
of
the
building
in
a
position
convenient
for
raising
it
to
its
ultimate
destination
it
is
one
piece
of
and
weighs
nearly
tons
small
changes
as
previously
mentioned
had
been
noticed
with
regard
to
the
zero
of
azimuth
of
the
transit
circle
and
the
report
states
that
regard
to
the
azimuth
of
the
transit
circle
and
the
azimuth
of
its
collimator
mr
main
has
brought
together
the
results
of
several
years
and
the
following
law
appears
to
hold
there
is
a
annual
periodical
change
in
the
position
of
the
transit
circle
the
southerly
movement
of
the
eastern
pivot
having
its
minimum
value
in
september
and
its
maximum
in
march
the
extreme
range
being
about
seconds
and
there
is
a
similar
change
but
of
smaller
amount
in
the
position
of
the
collimator
i
can
not
conjecture
any
cause
for
these
changes
except
in
the
motion
of
the
ground
there
is
also
a
connection
between
the
state
of
level
of
the
axis
and
the
temperature
the
eastern
pivot
always
rises
when
the
temperature
rises
the
extreme
range
being
about
seconds
i
can
not
offer
any
explanation
of
this
under
the
head
of
extraneous
works
the
report
states
that
british
government
had
for
some
years
past
contributed
by
pecuniary
grants
to
the
preparation
of
hansen
lunar
tables
in
the
last
winter
they
undertook
the
entire
expense
of
printing
a
large
impression
of
the
tables
the
reading
of
the
a
very
considerable
labour
has
been
effected
entirely
at
the
observatory
i
may
take
this
opportunity
of
stating
that
the
use
of
these
tables
has
enabled
me
as
i
think
incontestably
to
fix
the
capture
of
larissa
to
the
date
may
this
identification
promises
to
prove
valuable
not
merely
for
its
chronological
utility
but
also
for
its
accurate
determination
of
an
astronomical
epoch
the
point
eclipsed
being
exactly
known
and
the
shadow
having
been
very
small
in
april
i
gave
a
lecture
to
the
royal
astronomical
society
on
the
methods
available
through
the
next
years
for
the
determination
of
the
sun
dr
livingstone
observations
for
african
longitudes
were
computed
at
the
the
admiralty
enquire
of
me
about
the
feasibility
of
adopting
piazzi
smyth
construction
for
steadying
telescopes
on
board
ship
i
gave
a
report
of
mixed
character
on
the
whole
i
had
correspondence
with
bond
and
others
about
photographing
the
stars
and
on
piazzi
smyth
books
relating
to
the
teneriffe
experiment
were
sent
to
me
i
recommended
that
an
abridged
report
should
be
sent
to
the
royal
respecting
the
sheepshanks
fund
there
was
correspondence
with
miss
sheepshanks
and
whewell
but
nothing
got
into
shape
this
year
miss
sheepshanks
transferred
to
me
lying
at
overend
and
in
november
experiments
were
made
for
the
longitude
of
edinburgh
which
failed
totally
from
the
bad
state
of
the
telegraph
wire
between
deptford
and
the
in
june
the
first
suggestion
was
made
to
me
by
capt
washington
for
on
the
lizard
point
which
in
no
long
time
i
changed
for
the
start
the
admiralty
call
for
estimates
for
a
at
portsmouth
on
receiving
them
they
decline
further
i
was
engaged
in
speculations
and
correspondence
about
the
atlantic
submarine
in
the
royal
astronomical
society
i
presented
memoirs
and
gave
lectures
on
the
three
great
chronological
eclipses
agathocles
thales
larissa
on
airy
wrote
to
the
of
the
university
of
cambridge
objecting
to
the
proposed
changes
regarding
the
smith
prizes
a
subject
in
which
he
took
much
interest
and
to
which
he
ascribed
great
on
apr
i
was
in
correspondence
with
herbert
of
the
trinity
house
about
floating
in
july
i
reported
to
the
treasury
on
the
swedish
calculating
engine
i
think
on
the
occasion
of
mr
farr
of
the
office
applying
for
one
in
november
i
had
correspondence
about
the
launch
of
the
great
eastern
and
the
main
drainage
of
london
of
private
history
on
i
returned
from
from
june
to
i
was
travelling
in
scotland
with
my
wife
and
two
eldest
sons
chiefly
in
the
west
highlands
on
our
return
we
visited
mrs
smith
my
wife
mother
at
on
i
went
to
playford
in
the
minutes
of
the
visitors
it
is
noted
that
the
new
warrant
was
received
the
principal
change
was
the
exclusion
of
the
astronomer
royal
and
the
other
observatory
officers
from
the
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
it
is
stated
that
papers
of
the
board
of
longitude
are
now
finally
stitched
into
books
they
will
probably
form
one
of
the
most
curious
collections
of
the
results
of
scientific
enterprise
both
normal
and
abnormal
which
exists
it
appears
that
the
galvanic
communications
external
to
the
observatory
had
been
in
a
bad
state
the
four
wires
to
london
bridge
having
probably
been
injured
by
a
thunderstorm
in
the
last
autumn
and
the
report
states
that
state
of
the
wires
has
not
enabled
us
to
drop
the
ball
at
deal
the
feeble
current
which
arrives
there
has
been
used
for
some
months
merely
as
giving
a
signal
by
which
an
attendant
is
guided
in
dropping
the
ball
by
hand
regarding
the
new
equatoreal
the
report
states
that
the
new
equatoreal
the
was
furnished
by
messrs
merz
and
son
in
the
summer
of
last
year
and
i
made
various
trials
of
it
in
a
temporary
tube
carried
by
the
temporary
mounting
which
i
had
provided
and
finally
i
was
well
satisfied
with
it
i
can
not
yet
say
that
i
have
certainly
divided
the
small
star
of
gamma
andromedae
but
for
such
a
test
a
combination
of
favourable
circumstances
is
required
from
what
i
have
seen
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
proving
a
on
march
was
an
annular
eclipse
of
the
sun
for
the
observation
of
which
i
sent
parties
fully
equipped
to
bedford
wellingborough
and
market
harborough
the
observations
failed
totally
in
consequence
of
the
bad
weather
i
myself
went
to
harrowden
near
respecting
the
altazimuth
the
report
states
that
with
due
caution
as
to
the
zero
of
azimuth
results
of
observation
are
extremely
good
very
nearly
equal
to
those
of
the
meridional
instrument
perhaps
i
might
say
that
three
observations
with
the
altazimuth
are
equivalent
to
two
with
the
transit
circle
respecting
meteorological
observations
the
report
states
that
observations
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
thermometers
in
the
thames
interrupted
at
the
date
of
the
last
report
have
been
resumed
and
are
most
regularly
maintained
regarding
the
thames
as
the
grand
climatic
agent
on
london
and
its
neighbourhood
i
should
much
regret
the
suppression
of
these
observations
after
much
trouble
the
longitude
of
edinburgh
had
been
determined
retard
of
the
current
is
very
nearly
and
the
difference
of
longitudes
subject
to
personal
equations
the
report
concludes
thus
regard
to
the
direction
of
our
labours
i
trust
that
i
shall
always
be
supported
by
the
visitors
in
my
desire
to
maintain
the
fundamental
and
meridional
system
of
the
observatory
absolutely
intact
this
however
does
not
impede
the
extension
of
our
system
in
any
way
whatever
provided
that
such
means
are
arranged
for
carrying
out
the
extension
as
will
render
unnecessary
the
withdrawal
of
strength
from
what
are
now
the
engrossing
objects
of
the
observatory
i
had
much
correspondence
on
comets
of
which
great
comet
was
one
the
tail
of
this
comet
passed
over
arcturus
on
october
respecting
the
sheepshanks
fund
in
september
i
met
whewell
at
leeds
and
we
settled
orally
the
final
plan
of
the
scheme
on
i
saw
messrs
sharp
miss
solicitors
and
drew
up
a
draft
of
the
deed
of
gift
there
was
much
correspondence
and
on
i
wrote
to
the
of
cambridge
university
a
was
proposed
by
dr
philpott
master
of
st
catharine
college
by
arrangement
i
attended
the
council
of
the
university
on
and
explained
my
views
to
which
the
council
assented
on
the
senate
accepted
the
gift
of
miss
i
had
much
correspondence
throughout
this
year
with
the
treasury
herschel
sabine
and
the
royal
society
about
the
continuation
of
the
magnetic
establishments
the
reductions
of
the
magnetic
observations
were
commenced
in
february
of
this
year
under
the
direction
of
mr
lucas
a
computer
who
had
been
engaged
on
the
lunar
in
this
year
i
came
to
a
final
agreement
with
the
south
eastern
railway
company
about
defining
the
terms
of
our
connection
with
them
for
the
passage
of
time
signals
i
was
authorized
by
the
admiralty
to
sign
the
or
memorandum
of
agreement
and
it
was
signed
by
the
south
eastern
railway
on
i
made
my
first
proposal
to
sir
john
packington
first
lord

very
careful
and
critical
remarks
on

trinity
college
he
was
always
ready
to
take
action
in
the
interests
of
his
old
college
this
paper
procured
him
the
warmest
gratitude
from
the
fellows
of
the
college

private
history
on
i
returned
from
playford
from
july
to
i
was
on
an
expedition
in
switzerland
with
my
two
eldest
sons
at
paris
we
visited
le
verrier
and
at
geneva
we
visited
gautier
de
la
rive
and
plantamour
we
returned
by
on
i
went
to
playford
in
this
year
was
erected
in
playford
churchyard
a
granite
obelisk
in
memory
of
thomas
clarkson
it
was
built
by
subscription
amongst
a
few
friends
of
clarkson
and
the
negociations
and
arrangements
were
chiefly
carried
out
by
airy
who
zealously
exerted
himself
in
the
work
which
was
intended
to
honour
the
memory
of
his
early
friend
it
gave
him
much
trouble
during
the
years
to
here
is
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
the
athenaeum
on
some
other
trinity
matters
november
dear
sir
in
the
athenaeum
of
november
page
column
paragraph
there
is
an
account
of
the
erection
of
the
statue
of
barrow
in
trinity
college
antechapel
cambridge
conceived
in
a
spirit
hostile
to
the
university
and
written
in
great
ignorance
of
the
facts
on
the
latter
i
can
give
the
writer
some
information
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
who
was
a
trinity
man
and
whose
son
was
of
trinity
intimated
to
the
authorities
of
the
college
that
he
was
desirous
of
placing
in
the
antechapel
a
statue
of
this
regard
being
had
to
the
customs
and
the
of
cambridge
was
totally
impossible
the
antechapel
of
every
college
is
sacredly
reserved
for
memorials
of
the
men
of
that
college
only
and
milton
was
of
christ
college
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
on
hearing
this
objection
left
the
choice
of
the
person
to
be
commemorated
to
certain
persons
of
the
college
one
of
whom
a
literary
character
of
the
highest
eminence
and
a
profound
admirer
of
milton
has
not
resided
in
cambridge
for
many
years
several
names
were
carefully
considered
and
particularly
one
not
mentioned
by
your
correspondent
of
very
great
literary
celebrity
but
in
whose
writings
there
is
ingrained
so
much
of
ribaldry
and
licentiousness
that
he
was
at
length
given
up
finally
the
choice
rested
on
barrow
not
as
comparable
to
milton
but
as
a
person
of
reputation
in
his
day
and
as
the
best
who
could
be
found
under
all
the
circumstances
cromwell
never
was
mentioned
he
was
a
member
of
sidney
college
moreover
it
would
have
been
very
wrong
to
select
the
exponent
of
an
extreme
political
party
but
cromwell
has
i
believe
many
admirers
in
cambridge
to
which
list
i
attach
myself
i
had
no
part
in
the
negociations
above
mentioned
but
i
saw
the
original
letters
and
i
answer
for
the
perfect
correctness
of
what
i
have
stated
but
as
i
am
not
a
principal
i
decline
to
appear
in
public
it
is
much
to
be
desired
both
for
the
athenaeum
and
for
the
public
that
such
an
erroneous
statement
should
not
remain
uncorrected
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
correction
by
the
editor
would
be
just
and
graceful
and
would
tend
to
support
the
athenaeum
in
that
high
position
which
it
has
usually
maintained
i
am
dear
sir
yours
very
faithfully
airy
dixon
the
report
to
the
visitors
states
that
lunar
reductions
with
amended
elements
especially
parallax
for
correction
of
observations
from
to
are
now
completed
it
is
i
think
matter
of
congratulation
to
the
observatory
and
to
astronomy
that
there
are
now
exhibited
the
results
of
uninterrupted
lunar
observations
extending
through
more
than
a
century
made
at
the
same
place
reduced
under
the
same
superintendence
and
on
the
same
general
principles
and
compared
throughout
with
the
same
theoretical
tables
after
reference
to
the
great
value
of
the
greenwich
lunar
observations
to
hansen
in
constructing
his
tables
and
to
the
liberality
of
the
british
government
in
their
grants
to
hansen
the
report
continues
thus
strict
comparison
of
hansen
tables
with
the
greenwich
observations
of
late
years
both
meridional
and
was
commenced
the
same
observations
had
in
the
daily
routine
of
the
observatory
been
compared
with
the
nautical
almanac
or
burckhardt
tables
the
result
for
one
year
only
has
yet
reached
me
but
it
is
most
remarkable
the
sum
of
squares
of
residual
errors
with
hansen
tables
is
only
part
of
that
with
burckhardt
tables
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
this
is
included
the
entire
effect
of
errors
and
irregularities
of
observation
we
shall
be
justified
in
considering
hansen
tables
as
nearly
perfect
so
great
a
step
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
has
never
been
made
in
numerical
physical
theory
i
have
cited
this
at
length
not
only
as
interesting
to
the
visitors
from
the
circumstance
that
we
have
on
our
side
contributed
to
this
great
advance
but
also
because
an
innovation
peculiar
to
this
observatory
has
in
no
small
degree
aided
in
giving
a
decisive
character
to
the
comparison
i
have
never
concealed
my
opinion
that
the
introduction
and
vigorous
use
of
the
altazimuth
for
observations
of
the
moon
is
the
most
important
addition
to
the
system
of
the
observatory
that
has
been
made
for
many
years
the
largest
errors
of
burckhardt
tables
were
put
in
evidence
almost
always
by
the
altazimuth
observations
in
portions
of
the
moon
orbit
which
could
not
be
touched
by
the
meridional
instruments
they
amounted
sometimes
to
nearly
of
arc
and
they
naturally
became
the
crucial
errors
for
distinction
between
burckhardt
and
hansen
tables
those
errors
are
in
all
cases
corrected
with
great
accuracy
by
hansen
tables
the
report
concludes
with
the
following
paragraph
the
inauguration
of
the
new
equatoreal
will
terminate
the
entire
change
from
the
old
state
of
the
observatory
there
is
not
now
a
single
person
employed
or
instrument
used
in
the
observatory
which
was
there
in
mr
pond
time
nor
a
single
room
in
the
observatory
which
is
used
as
it
was
used
then
in
every
step
of
change
however
except
this
last
the
ancient
and
traditional
responsibilities
of
the
observatory
have
been
most
carefully
considered
and
in
the
last
the
substitution
of
a
new
instrument
was
so
absolutely
necessary
and
the
importance
of
tolerating
no
instrument
except
of
a
high
class
was
so
obvious
that
no
other
course
was
open
to
us
i
can
only
trust
that
while
the
use
of
the
equatoreal
within
legitimate
limits
may
enlarge
the
utility
and
the
reputation
of
the
observatory
it
may
never
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
that
which
has
always
been
the
staple
and
standard
work
here
concerning
the
sheepshanks
fund
there
was
much
correspondence
about
settling
the
gift
till
about
i
took
part
in
the
first
examination
for
the
scholarship
in
october
of
this
year
and
took
my
place
with
the
trinity
seniority
as
one
of
their
number
on
this
foundation
for
some
general
business
of
the
with
respect
to
the
correction
of
the
compass
in
iron
ships
i
sent
mr
ellis
to
liverpool
to
see
some
practice
there
in
the
correction
of
the
compass
in
september
i
urged
mr
rundell
to
make
a
voyage
in
the
great
eastern
just
floated
for
examination
of
her
compasses
and
lent
him
instruments
very
valuable
results
were
obtained
mr
archibald
smith
had
edited
scoresby
voyage
in
the
royal
charter
with
an
introduction
very
offensive
to
me
i
replied
fully
in
the
athenaeum
of
nov
the
sale
of
gas
act
an
act
of
parliament
promoted
by
private
members
of
the
house
of
commons
had
been
passed
without
the
knowledge
or
recollection
of
the
government
it
imposed
on
the
government
various
duties
about
the
preparation
of
standards
suddenly
at
the
very
expiration
of
the
time
allowed
this
came
to
the
knowledge
of
government
on
lord
monteagle
applied
to
me
for
assistance
on
and
i
wrote
to
mr
hamilton
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
received
authority
to
ask
for
the
assistance
of
i
made
an
examination
of
mr
ball
eyes
and
i
think
in
february
i
made
an
analysis
of
the
cambridge
tripos
examination
which
i
communicated
to
some
cambridge
residents
in
a
letter
on
this
subject
to
one
of
his
cambridge
friends
airy
gives
his
opinion
as
follows
i
have
looked
very
carefully
over
the
examination
papers
and
think
them
on
the
whole
very
bad
they
are
utterly
perverted
by
the
insane
love
of
problems
and
by
the
foolish
importance
given
to
wholly
useless
parts
of
algebraical
geometry
for
the
sake
of
these
every
physical
subject
and
every
useful
application
of
pure
mathematics
are
cut
down
or
not
mentioned
this
led
to
much
discussion
at
cambridge
in
this
year
the
smith
prizes
were
awarded
to
the
and
wranglers
of
private
history
on
apr
mrs
smith
my
wife
mother
died
at
from
july
to
i
was
in
france
auvergne
and
the
vivarais
with
my
two
eldest
sons
maclear
travelled
with
us
to
on
i
went
to
playford
antiquities
and
historical
questions
connected
with
military
movements
had
a
very
great
attraction
for
airy
on
his
return
from
the
expedition
in
france
he
engaged
in
considerable
correspondence
with
military
authorities
regarding
points
connected
with
the
battle
of
toulouse
and
in
this
year
also
he
had
much
correspondence
with
the
duke
of
northumberland
concerning
his
map
of
the
roman
wall
and
the
military
points
relating
to
the
same
in
june
mr
main
accepted
the
office
of
radcliffe
observer
at
oxford
mr
johnson
having
died
and
resigned
the
first
assistancy
at
greenwich
in
october
mr
stone
was
appointed
first
at
an
adjourned
meeting
of
the
visitors
on
june
there
were
very
heavy
discussions
on
hansen
merits
and
about
the
grant
to
him
papers
were
read
from
sir
lubbock
babbage
south
whewell
and
me
finally
it
was
recommended
to
the
government
to
grant
to
hansen
which
was
paid
to
in
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
the
following
remark
occurs
apparent
existence
of
a
discordance
between
the
results
of
direct
observations
and
reflection
observations
after
the
application
of
corrections
for
flexure
founded
upon
observations
of
the
horizontal
collimator
wires
to
an
extent
far
greater
than
can
be
explained
by
any
disturbance
of
the
direction
of
gravity
on
the
quicksilver
by
its
distance
from
the
vertical
or
by
the
attraction
of
neighbouring
masses
perplexes
me
much
with
respect
to
the
discordance
of
dips
of
the
which
for
years
past
had
been
a
source
of
great
trouble
and
puzzle
the
report
states
that
are
still
a
source
of
anxiety
the
form
which
their
anomalies
appear
to
take
is
that
of
a
special
or
peculiar
value
of
the
dip
given
by
each
separate
needle
with
one
of
the
needles
the
result
always
differs
about
a
quarter
of
a
degree
from
that
of
the
others
i
can
see
nothing
in
its
mechanical
construction
to
explain
reference
is
made
to
the
spontaneous
currents
through
the
wires
of
telegraph
companies
which
are
frequently
violent
and
always
occur
at
the
times
of
magnetic
storms
and
the
report
continues
may
be
worth
considering
whether
it
would
ever
be
desirable
to
establish
in
two
directions
at
right
angles
to
each
other
for
instance
along
the
brighton
railway
and
along
the
north
kent
railway
wires
which
would
photographically
register
in
the
royal
observatory
the
currents
that
pass
in
these
directions
exhibiting
their
indications
by
photographic
curves
in
close
juxtaposition
with
the
registers
of
the
magnetic
elements
in
connection
with
the
reduction
of
the
greenwich
lunar
observations
from
to
the
report
states
that
comparison
of
hansen
lunar
tables
with
the
greenwich
observations
which
at
the
last
visitation
had
been
completed
for
one
year
only
has
now
been
finished
for
the
twelve
years
to
the
results
for
the
whole
period
agree
entirely
in
their
general
spirit
with
those
for
the
year
cited
in
the
last
report
the
greatest
difference
between
the
merits
of
burckhardt
and
hansen
tables
appears
in
the
meridional
longitudes
when
the
proportion
of
the
sum
of
squares
of
errors
is
as
burckhardt
to
hansen
the
nearest
approach
is
in
the
altazimuth
latitudes
when
the
proportion
of
the
sum
of
squares
of
errors
is
as
burckhardt
to
hansen
a
special
address
to
the
members
of
the
board
of
visitors
has
reference
to
the
proposals
of
struve
for
amongst
other
matters
the
improved
determination
of
the
longitude
of
valencia
and
the
galvanic
determination
of
the
extreme
eastern
station
of
the
british
on
i
circulated
amongst
the
visitors
my
remarks
on
a
paper
entitled
the
polar
distances
of
the
greenwich
by
marth
printed
in
the
astronomische
nachrichten
the
paper
by
mr
marth
was
an
elaborate
attack
on
the
greenwich
methods
of
observation
and
my
remarks
were
a
detailed
refutation
of
his
on
i
made
enquiry
of
sabine
as
to
the
advantage
of
keeping
up
magnetic
observations
on
he
wrote
avoiding
my
question
in
some
measure
but
saying
that
our
instruments
must
be
changed
for
such
as
those
at
kew
his
observatory
i
replied
generally
declining
to
act
on
that
in
march
and
april
i
was
in
correspondence
with
mr
cowper
first
commissioner
of
works
about
the
bells
of
the
westminster
clock
also
about
the
smoky
chimneys
of
the
various

i
made
my
report
on

i
employed
a
professional
musician
to
examine
the
tones
of

was
made
for

paper
on
aberration
appeared
in
the
astronomische
nachrichten
this
with
others
led
to
the
construction
of
the
several
years
in
september
i
wrote
in
the
athenaeum
against
a
notion
of
sir
james
on
the
effect
of
an
upheaval
of
a
mountain
in
changing
the
earth
axis
in
october
i
had
drawn
up
a
list
of
days
for
a
possible
evagation
of
the
earth
poles
but
apparently
nothing
was
done
upon
them
in
this
year
i
was
a
good
deal
occupied
for
the
lighthouse
commission
on
admiral
hamilton
chairman
applied
to
me
for
assistance
in
april
i
went
to
chance
factory
in
birmingham
on
this
business
in
may
i
made
my
report
on
the
start
lighthouse
after
inspection
with
the
commission
in
june
with
my
son
hubert
i
visited
the
whitby
lighthouses
and
discovered
a
fault
of
a
singular
kind
which
most
materially
diminished
their
power
this
discovery
led
to
a
general
examination
of
lighthouses
by
the
trinity
board
to
a
modification
of
many
and
to
a
general
improvement
of
system
on
june
i
reported
on
the
lights
at
calais
cap
de
valde
grisnez
south

in
august
i
had
been
to

the

in
october
i
went
with
my
son
hubert
to
aberdeen
to
see
the
girdleness
lighthouse
on
i
made
a
general
report
this
was
the
year
of
the
great
total
solar
eclipse
visible
in
spain
at
my
representation
the
admiralty
placed
at
my
command
the
large

to
carry
about

british
and
foreign
some
were
landed
at
santander
i
with
many
at
bilbao
the
eclipse
was
fairly
well
observed
i
personally
did
not
do
my
part
well
the
most
important
were
mr
de
la
rue
photographic
operations
at
greenwich
i
had
arranged
a
very
careful
series
of
observations
with
the
great
equatoreal
which
were
fully
carried
out
the
eclipse
expedition
to
spain
shortly
referred
to
above
was
most
interesting
not
merely
from
the
importance
of
the
results
obtained
and
some
of
the
parties
were
very
fortunate
in
the
weather
but
from
the
character
of
the
expedition
it
was
a
wonderful
combination
of
the
astronomers
of
europe
who
were
all
received
on
board
the
and
were
conveyed
together
to
the
coast
of
spain
the
polyglot
of
languages
was
most
remarkable
but
the
utmost
harmony
and
enthusiasm
prevailed
from
first
to
last
and
this
had
much
to
do
with
the
general
success
of
the
expedition
those
who
landed
at
bilbao
were
received
in
the
kindest
and
most
hospitable
manner
by
mr
vignoles
the
of
the
bilbao
and
tudela
railway
which
was
then
under
construction
this
gentleman
made
arrangements
for
the
conveyance
of
parties
to
points
in
the
interior
of
the
country
which
were
judged
suitable
for
the
observation
of
the
eclipse
and
placed
all
the
resources
of
his
staff
at
the
disposal
of
the
expedition
in
the
most
liberal
manner
the
universal
opinion
was
that
very
great
difficulty
would
have
been
experienced
without
the
active
and
generous
assistance
of
mr
vignoles
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
vote
of
thanks
to
mr
vignoles
proposed
by
the
astronomer
royal
during
the
return
voyage
was
passed
by
acclamation
and
with
a
very
sincere
feeling
of
gratitude
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
great
and
liberal
aid
of
mr
vignoles
and
the
disinterested
love
of
science
evinced
by
him
on
this
occasion
the
success
of
the
himalaya
eclipse
expedition
could
not
have
been
ensured
there
is
a
graphic
and
interesting
account
of
the
reception
of
the
party
at
bilbao
given
in
the
of
vignoles
soldier
and
civil
engineer
by
vignoles
of
private
history
on
may
my
venerable
friend
arthur
biddell
died
he
had
been
in
many
respects
more
than
a
father
to
me
i
can
not
express
how
much
i
owed
to
him
especially
in
my
from
june
to
i
visited
the
whitby
lighthouses
with
my
son
from
july
to
i
was
in
spain
on
the
expedition
to
observe
the
total
eclipse
i
was
accompanied
by
my
wife
my
eldest
son
and
my
eldest
from
to
i
went
with
my
son
hubert
to
aberdeen
to
see
the
girdleness
lighthouse
making
lateral
trips
to
cumberland
in
going
and
on
i
went
to
playford
in
the
report
to
the
visitors
there
is
great
complaint
of
want
of
room
increase
of
computations
we
want
more
room
for
computers
with
our
greatly
increased
business
of
chronometers
and
we
are
in
want
of
a
nearly
separate
series
of
rooms
for
the
we
want
rooms
for
and
we
require
rooms
for
the
photographic
operations
and
the
computations
of
the
magnetic
department
the
report
gives
a
curious
history
of
dr
bradley
observations
which
in
had
been
transferred
to
the
university
of
oxford
and
proceeds
thus
lately
i
applied
in
the
first
instance
through
lord
wrottesley
to
the
dr
jeune
in
reference
to
the
possibility
of
transferring
these
manuscripts
to
the
royal
observatory
finally
a
decree
for
the
transfer
of
the
manuscript
observations
to
the
royal
observatory
without
any
condition
was
proposed
to
convocation
on
may
and
was
passed
unanimously
and
on
may
my
assistant
mr
dunkin
was
sent
to
oxford
to
receive
them
and
thus
after
a
delay
of
very
nearly
a
century
the
great
work
of
justice
is
at
length
completed
and
the
great
gap
in
our
manuscript
observations
is
at
length
filled
up
with
reference
to
the
transit
circle
it
had
been
remarked
that
the
collimators
were
slightly
disturbed
by
the
proximity
of
the
of
their
illuminators
and
after
various
experiments
as
to
the
cause
of
it
the
report
proceeds
thus
my
great
surprise
i
found
that
the
disturbance
was
entirely
due
to
the
radiation
of
the
flame
upon
a
very
small
corner
about
square
inches
of
the
large
and
massive
stone
on
which
the
collimator
is
planted
the
tin
plates
were
subsequently
shaped
in
such
a
manner
as
to
protect
the
stone
as
well
as
the
metal
and
the
disturbance
has
entirely
ceased
regarding
the
large
equatoreal
the
report
states
that
the
character
of
its
i
am
now
able
to
speak
first
from
the
examination
of
mr
otto
struve
made
in
a
favourable
state
of
atmosphere
secondly
from
the
examinations
of
my
assistants
i
have
not
myself
obtained
a
sight
of
a
on
a
night
of
very
good
definition
it
appears
to
be
of
the
highest
order
the
small
star
of
gamma
andromedae
is
so
far
separated
as
to
shew
a
broad
dark
space
between
its
components
some
blue
colour
is
shewn
about
the
bright
planets
it
is
noted
in
the
report
that
equatoreal
observations
of
the
solar
eclipse
are
completely
reduced
and
the
results
are
valuable
it
appears
from
them
that
the
error
in
right
ascension
of
burckhardt
lunar
tables
at
the
time
of
the
eclipse
amounted
to
about
while
that
of
hansen
ultimately
adopted
by
mr
hind
for
the
calculation
of
the
eclipse
did
not
exceed
with
regard
to
chronometers
it
is
stated
that
use
of
the
chronometer
oven
to
which
i
have
formerly
alluded
we
have
been
able
to
give
great
attention
to
the
compensation
i
have
reason
to
think
that
we
are
producing
a
most
beneficial
effect
on
the
manufacture
and
adjustment
of
chronometers
in
general
with
regard
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
observatory
and
survey
the
admiralty
enquire
of
me
when
the
survey
work
will
be
completed
and
i
enquire
of
maclear
is
the
printing
of
your
survey
work
in
i
began
to
press
it
strongly
and
in
very
i
introduced
a
method
constantly
pursued
since
that
time
at
the
royal
observatory
for
computing
interpolations
without
changes
of
i
had
correspondence
with
herschel
and
faraday
on
the
possible
effect
of
the
sun
radiant
heat
on
the
sea
as
explaining
the
curve
of
diurnal
magnetic
inequality
that
diurnal
inequality
was
inferred
from
the
magnetic
reductions
which
were
terminated
in
regarding
the
proposal
of
hourly
on
the
start
point
i
consulted
telegraph
engineers
upon
the
practical
points
and
on
i
proposed
a
formal
scheme
in
complete
detail
the
matter
has
been
repeatedly
brought
before
the
admiralty
but
has
been
uniformly
rejected
i
was
engaged
on
the
question
of
the
bad
ocular
vision
of
two
or
three
the
british
association
meeting
was
held
at
manchester
i
was
president
of
section
i
gave
a
lecture
on
the
eclipse
of
to
an
enormous
attendance
in
the
free
trade
hall
the
following
record
of
the
lecture
is
extracted
from
dr
routh
obituary
notice
of
airy
written
for
the
proceedings
of
the
royal
society
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
manchester
in
mr
airy
delivered
a
lecture
on
the
solar
eclipse
of
to
an
assembly
of
perhaps
persons
the
writer
remembers
the
great
free
trade
hall
crowded
to
excess
with
an
immense
audience
whose
attention
and
interest
notwithstanding
a
weak
voice
he
was
able
to
retain
to
the
very
end
of
the
lecture
charm
of
professor
airy
lectures
lay
in
the
clearness
of
his
explanations
the
subjects
also
of
his
lectures
were
generally
those
to
which
his
attention
had
been
turned
by
other
causes
so
that
he
had
much
that
was
new
to
tell
his
manner
was
slightly
hesitating
and
he
used
frequent
repetitions
which
perhaps
were
necessary
from
the
newness
of
the
ideas
as
the
lecturer
proceeded
his
hearers
forgot
these
imperfections
and
found
their
whole
attention
rivetted
to
the
subject
matter
of
private
history
on
there
was
a
most
remarkable
crystallization
of
the
ice
on
the
flooded
meadows
at
playford
the
frost
was
very
from
june
to
i
was
at
the
grange
near
keswick
where
i
hired
a
house
with
my
wife
and
most
of
my
from
to
i
was
on
an
expedition
in
the
south
of
scotland
with
my
son
wilfrid
we
walked
with
our
knapsacks
by
the
roman
road
across
the
cheviots
to
on
i
went
to
playford
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
states
that
new
range
of
wooden
buildings
the
magnetic
offices
is
in
progress
at
the
extremity
of
the
magnetic
ground
it
will
include
seven
rooms
also
took
this
opportunity
the
relaying
of
the
of
establishing
two
powerful
one
in
the
front
court
and
one
in
the
magnetic
ground
a
stock
of
adapted
to
the
having
been
previously
secured
in
the
observatory
wires
intended
for
the
examination
of
spontaneous
have
been
carried
from
the
magnetic
observatory
to
the
railway
station
in
the
town
of
greenwich
from
this
point
one
wire
is
to
be
led
to
a
point
in
the
neighbourhood
of
croydon
the
other
to
a
point
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dartford
each
wire
is
to
be
connected
at
its
two
extremities
with
the
earth
the
angle
included
between
the
general
directions
of
these
two
lines
is
nearly
a
right
angle
kew
unifilar
magnetometer
adapted
to
the
determination
of
the
horizontal
part
of
terrestrial
magnetic
force
in
absolute
measure
was
mounted
in
the
summer
of
and
till
february
occasional
observations
in
all
were
taken
simultaneously
with
the
old
and
with
the
new
instrument
the
comparison
of
results
shewed
a
steady
but
very
small
difference
not
greater
probably
than
may
correspond
to
the
omission
of
the
inverse
seventh
powers
of
distance
in
the
theoretical
investigation
proving
that
the
old
instrument
had
been
quite
efficient
for
its
purpose
great
efforts
had
been
made
to
deduce
a
law
from
the
diurnal
inequalities
in
declination
and
horizontal
force
as
shewn
by
the
magnetic
observations
but
without
success
the
report
states
that
results
are
most
amazing
for
the
variation
in
magnitude
as
well
as
in
law
what
cosmical
change
can
be
indicated
by
them
is
entirely
beyond
my
power
of
conjecture
have
alluded
in
the
two
last
reports
to
the
steps
necessary
on
the
english
side
for
completing
the
great
arc
of
parallel
from
valencia
to
the
volga
the
russian
portion
of
the
work
is
far
advanced
and
will
be
finished
it
is
understood
in
the
coming
summer
it
appeared
to
me
therefore
that
the
repetition
of
the
measure
of
astronomical
longitude
between
greenwich
and
valencia
could
be
no
longer
delayed
two
assistants
of
the
royal
observatory
mr
dunkin
and
mr
criswick
will
at
once
proceed
to
valencia
for
the
determination
of
local
time
and
the
management
of
galvanic
signals
now
ask
leave
to
press
the
subject
of
hourly
time
signals
at
the
start
point
on
the
attention
of
the
board
and
to
submit
the
advantage
of
their
addressing
the
board
of
admiralty
upon
it
the
great
majority
of
ships
pass
within
sight
of
the
start
and
if
an
hourly
signal
were
exhibited
would
have
the
means
of
regulating
their
chronometers
at
a
most
critical
part
of
their
voyage
the
plan
of
the
entire
system
of
operations
is
completely
arranged
the
estimated
expense
of
outfit
is
and
the
estimated
annual
expense
is
both
liable
to
some
uncertainty
but
sufficiently
exact
to
shew
that
the
outlay
is
inconsiderable
in
comparison
with
the
advantages
which
might
be
expected
from
it
i
know
no
direction
of
the
powers
of
the
observatory
which
would
tend
so
energetically
to
carry
out
the
great
object
of
its
establishment
viz
the
finding
out
the
so
much
desired
longitude
at
sea
the
attention
of
the
visitors
is
strongly
drawn
to
the
pressure
on
the
strength
of
the
observatory
caused
by
the
observation
of
the
numerous
small
planets
and
the
paragraph
concludes
thus
shall
however
again
endeavour
to
effect
a
partition
of
this
labour
with
some
other
observatory
a
small
fire
having
occurred
in
the
magnetic
observatory
a
new
building
of
zinc
for
the
operation
of
naphthalizing
the
illuminating
gas
is
in
preparation
external
to
the
observatory
and
thus
one
of
the
possible
sources
of
accidental
fire
will
be
miss
sheepshanks
added
through
me
to
her
former
gift
i
transferred
it
i
believe
to
the
master
and
seniors
of
trinity
college
in
this
year
airy
contributed
to
the
royal
society
two
papers
one
on
the
magnetic
properties
of
and
malleable
iron
the
other
on
the
strains
in
the
interior
of
beams
he
gave
evidence
before
the
select
committee
on
weights
and
measures
and
also
before
the
public
schools
commission
in
the
latter
part
of
a
difference
arose
between
airy
and
sabine
in
consequence
of
remarks
made
by
the
latter
at
a
meeting
of
the
committee
of
recommendations
of
the
british
association
these
remarks
were
to
the
effect
that
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
the
complete
system
of
of
magnetic
phenomena
at
the
kew
observatory
because
no
sufficient
system
of
magnetic
record
is
maintained
elsewhere
in
england
implying
pointedly
that
the
system
at
the
royal
observatory
of
greenwich
was
insufficient
this
matter
was
taken
up
very
warmly
by
airy
and
after
a
short
and
acrimonious
correspondence
with
sabine
he
issued
a
private
address
to
the
visitors
enclosing
copies
of
the
correspondence
with
his
remarks
and
requesting
the
board
to
take
the
matter
of
this
attack
into
their
careful
consideration
this
address
is
dated
november
and
it
was
followed
by
another
dated
january
which
contains
a
careful
reply
to
the
various
points
of
general
sabine
attack
and
concludes
with
a
distinct
statement
that
he
the
astronomer
royal
can
no
longer
act
in
confidence
with
sabine
as
a
member
of
the
board
of
visitors
of
private
history
there
were
the
usual
short
visits
to
playford
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
from
june
to
he
was
in
scotland
chiefly
in
the
western
highlands
with
his
wife
and
his
sons
hubert
and
osmund
in
the
course
of
this
journey
he
visited
the
corryvreckan
whirlpool
near
the
island
of
scarba
and
the
following
paragraph
relating
to
this
expedition
is
extracted
from
his
journal
landed
in
black
mile
bay
island
of
luing
at
here
by
previous
arrangement
with
mr
a
brown
agent
of
the
company
a
boat
was
waiting
to
take
us
to
scarba
and
the
corryvreckan
we
were
pulled
across
to
the
island
of
lunga
and
rowed
along
its
length
till
we
came
to
the
first
channel
opening
from
the
main
sea
which
the
sailors
called
the
little
gulf
here
the
sea
was
rushing
inwards
in
a
manner
of
which
i
had
no
conception
streams
were
running
with
raving
speed
sometimes
in
opposite
directions
side
by
side
with
high
billows
where
the
streams
touched
were
sometimes
great
whirls
one
not
many
yards
from
our
boat
that
looked
as
if
they
would
suck
anything
down
sometimes
among
all
this
were
great
smooth
parts
of
the
sea
still
in
a
whirling
trouble
which
were
surrounded
by
the
mad
currents
we
seemed
entirely
powerless
among
all
these
in
the
beginning
of
this
year
the
duke
of
manchester
in
writing
to
the
rev
airy
had
said
i
wish
your
brother
the
astronomer
royal
could
be
induced
to
have
investigations
made
as
to
whether
the
aspects
of
the
planets
have
any
effect
on
the
weather
this
enquiry
produced
the
following
reply
a
subject
like
that
of
the
occult
influences
of
the
planets
using
the
word
occult
in
no
bad
sense
but
simply
as
meaning
not
traced
can
be
approached
in
two
ways
either
by
the
à
priori
probability
of
the
existence
of
such
influences
or
by
the
à
posteriori
evidence
of
their
effects
if
the
two
can
be
combined
the
subject
may
be
considered
as
claiming
the
dignity
of
a
science
even
if
the
effects
alone
are
certain
it
may
be
considered
that
we
have
a
science
of
inferior
degree
wanting
however
that
definiteness
of
law
and
that
general
plausibility
which
can
only
be
given
when
true
causes
in
accordance
with
antecedent
experience
in
other
cases
can
be
suggested
now
in
regard
to
the
à
priori
probability
of
the
existence
of
planetary
influences
i
am
far
from
saying
that
such
a
thing
is
impossible
the
discoveries
of
modern
philosophy
have
all
tended
to
shew
that
there
may
be
many
things
about
us
unknown
even
to
the
scientific
world
but
which
accidents
reveal
with
the
most
positive
certainty
it
is
known
that
every
beam
of
light
is
accompanied
by
a
beam
of
chemical
agency
totally
undiscoverable
to
the
senses
of
light
or
warmth
but
admitting
of
separation
from
the
luminous
and
warm
rays
and
producing
photogenic
effects
we
know
that
there
are
disturbances
of
magnetism
going
on
about
us
affecting
whole
continents
at
a
time
unknown
to
men
in
general
but
traceable
with
facility
and
certainty
and
which
doubtless
affect
even
our
brains
and
nerves
which
are
indisputably
subject
to
the
influence
of
magnetism
now
in
the
face
of
these
things
i
will
not
undertake
to
say
that
there
is
any
impossibility
or
even
any
want
of
plausibility
in
the
supposition
that
bodies
external
to
the
earth
may
affect
us
it
may
well
be
cited
in
its
favour
that
it
is
certain
that
the
sun
affects
our
magnetism
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
does
so
or
mediately
by
giving
different
degrees
of
warmth
to
different
parts
of
the
earth
and
it
is
believed
on
inferior
evidence
that
the
moon
also
affects
it
it
may
therefore
seem
not
impossible
or
unplausible
that
other
celestial
bodies
may
affect
perhaps
others
of
the
powers
of
nature
about
us
but
there
i
must
stop
the
denial
of
the
impossibility
is
no
assertion
of
the
truth
or
probability
and
i
absolutely
decline
to
take
either
side
either
that
the
influences
are
real
or
that
the
influences
are
unreal
till
i
see
evidence
of
their
effects
such
evidence
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
extract
from
ordinary
facts
of
observation
i
have
alluded
to
the
sun
daily
disturbance
of
the
magnet
as
one
of
the
most
certain
of
influences
yet
if
you
were
to
observe
the
magnet
for
a
single
day
or
perhaps
for
several
days
you
might
see
no
evidence
of
that
influence
so
completely
is
it
involved
with
other
disturbances
whose
causes
and
laws
are
totally
unknown
i
believe
that
in
addition
to
the
effects
ascribable
to
newtonian
gravitation
as
general
motion
of
the
earth
precession
of
the
equinoxes
and
tides
this
magnetic
disturbance
is
the
only
one
yet
established
as
depending
on
an
external
body
men
in
general
however
do
not
think
so
it
appears
to
be
a
law
of
the
human
mind
to
love
to
trace
an
effect
to
a
cause
and
to
be
ready
to
assent
to
any
specious
cause
thus
all
practical
men
of
the
lower
classes
even
those
whose
pecuniary
interests
are
concerned
in
it
believe
firmly
in
the
influence
of
the
moon
upon
the
winds
and
the
weather
i
believe
that
every
careful
examiner
of
recorded
facts
among
whom
i
place
myself
as
regards
the
winds
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
influence
of
the
moon
is
not
discoverable
i
point
out
these
two
things
magnetic
disturbances
and
weather
as
tending
to
shew
that
notoriety
or
the
assumed
consent
of
practical
men
are
of
no
value
the
unnotorious
matter
may
be
quite
certain
the
notorious
matter
may
have
no
foundation
everything
must
stand
on
its
own
evidence
as
completely
digested
and
examined
of
such
evidence
the
planetary
influence
has
not
a
particle
my
intended
short
note
has
in
the
course
of
writing
grown
up
into
a
discourse
of
very
unreasonable
length
and
it
is
possible
that
a
large
portion
of
it
has
only
increased
obscurity
at
any
rate
i
can
add
nothing
i
believe
which
can
help
to
explain
more
fully
my
views
on
this
matter
in
this
year
june
airy
received
the
honorary
degree
of
in
the
university
of
cambridge
he
was
nominated
by
the
duke
of
devonshire
as
appears
from
the
following
letter
lismore
castle
ireland
my
dear
sir
it
is
proposed
according
to
usage
to
confer
a
considerable
number
of
honorary
degrees
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
to
cambridge
as
chancellor
of
the
university
i
hope
that
you
will
allow
me
to
include
your
name
in
that
portion
of
the
list
which
i
have
been
invited
to
draw
up
the
ceremony
is
fixed
for
the
of
june
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
devonshire
astronomer
airy
reply
was
as
follows
royal
observatory
greenwich
london
april
my
lord
duke
i
am
exceedingly
gratified
by
your
communication
this
day
received
conveying
a
proposal
which
i
doubt
not
is
suggested
by
your
recollection
of
transactions
now
many
years
past
i
have
always
been
desirous
of
maintaining
my
connection
with
my
university
and
have
in
various
ways
interested
myself
practically
in
its
concerns
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
have
the
connection
strengthened
in
the
flattering
way
which
you
propose
i
had
conceived
that
alumni
of
the
university
were
not
admissible
to
honorary
degrees
but
upon
this
point
the
information
possessed
by
your
grace
as
chancellor
of
the
university
can
not
be
disputed
i
am
my
lord
duke
your
grace
very
faithful
servant
airy
grace
the
duke
of
there
were
in
all
honorary
degrees
of
doctor
of
laws
conferred
on
the
of
june
including
men
of
such
eminence
as
armstrong
faraday
and
fairbairn
in
this
year
there
were
several
schemes
for
a
railway
through
the
lower
part
of
greenwich
park
the
most
important
being
the
scheme
of
the
london
chatham
and
dover
railway
company
in
reference
to
this
scheme
the
report
to
the
visitors
states
i
may
say
briefly
that
i
believe
that
it
would
be
possible
to
render
such
a
railway
innocuous
to
the
observatory
it
would
however
be
under
restrictions
which
might
be
felt
annoying
to
the
authorities
of
the
railway
but
whose
relaxation
would
almost
ensure
ruin
to
the
observatory
the
meridional
observations
of
mars
in
the
autumn
of
have
been
compared
with
those
made
at
the
observatory
of
williamstown
near
melbourne
australia
and
they
give
for
mean
solar
parallax
the
value
exceeding
the
received
value
by
about
part
a
value
nearly
identical
with
this
has
also
been
found
by
comparing
the
pulkowa
and
cape
of
good
hope
observations
the
results
of
the
new
in
and
appear
to
give
a
firm
foundation
for
speculations
on
the
state
and
change
of
the
dip
as
a
general
result
i
may
state
as
probable
that
the
value
of
dip
in
the
middle
of
was
about
and
in
the
middle
of
about
the
decrease
of
dip
appears
to
be
more
rapid
in
the
second
half
of
this
interval
than
in
the
first
the
dip
at
beginning
of
being
about
with
reference
to
the
of
the
longitude
of
valencia
it
is
stated
that
the
concluded
longitude
agrees
almost
exactly
with
that
determined
by
the
transmission
of
chronometers
in
and
entitles
us
to
believe
that
the
longitudes
of
kingstown
and
liverpool
steps
in
the
chronometer
conveyance
were
determined
with
equal
accuracy
the
computations
for
inferring
the
direction
and
amount
of
movement
of
the
solar
system
in
space
from
the
observed
proper
motions
of
stars
have
been
completed
the
result
is
that
the
sun
is
moving
towards
a
point
not
very
different
from
sir
herschel
but
depending
much
in
on
the
accuracy
of
bradley
quadrant
observations
and
that
its
annual
motion
subtends
at
the
distance
of
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
the
angle
but
the
comparison
of
the
sum
of
squares
of
apparent
proper
motions
uncorrected
with
the
sum
of
squares
of
apparent
proper
motions
corrected
for
motion
of
sun
shews
so
small
an
advance
in
the
explanation
of
the
star
apparent
movements
as
to
throw
great
doubt
on
the
certainty
of
results
the
sum
of
squares
being
diminished
by
only
part
i
had
been
writing
strongly
to
maclear
on
the
delays
in
publishing
both
the
geodetic
work
and
the
star
catalogue
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
he
resolves
to
go
on
with
these
works
in
december
i
am
still
very
urgent
about
the
geodesy
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
short
visit
to
playford
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
from
june
to
august
i
was
travelling
in
the
north
and
west
of
scotland
with
my
wife
my
youngest
son
osmund
and
my
daughter
annot
in
this
year
the
offer
of
knighthood
for
the
third
time
was
made
to
airy
through
the
rt
hon
sir
george
lewis
bart
the
offer
was
accepted
on
but
on
the
same
day
a
second
letter
was
written
as
follows
dear
sir
i
am
extremely
ignorant
of
all
matters
connected
with
court
ceremonial
and
in
reference
to
the
proposed
knighthood
would
ask
you
i
trust
that
there
is
no
expense
of
fees
to
persons
like
myself
of
small
fortune
an
honour
may
sometimes
be
somewhat
dear
my
highest
social
rank
is
that
given
by
my
academical
degree
of
which
i
hold
in
the
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
in
regard
to
costume
would
it
be
proper
that
i
should
appear
in
the
scarlet
gown
of
that
degree
or
in
the
ordinary
court
dress
i
am
dear
sir
yours
very
faithfully
airy
right
honourable
sir
george
lewis
to
this
letter
sir
lewis
replied
that
the
fees
would
amount
to
about
an
intimation
which
produced
the
following
letter
royal
observatory
greenwich
dear
sir
i
have
to
acknowledge
your
letter
of
yesterday
and
i
advert
to
that
part
of
it
in
which
it
is
stated
that
the
fees
on
knighthood
amount
to
about
years
ago
the
same
rank
was
offered
to
me
by
lord
john
russell
and
mr
spring
rice
then
ministers
of
the
crown
with
the
express
notice
that
no
fees
would
be
payable
i
suppose
that
the
usage
whatever
it
be
on
which
that
notice
was
founded
still
subsists
to
a
person
whose
annual
income
little
more
than
suffices
to
meet
the
annual
expenses
of
a
very
moderate
establishment
an
unsought
honour
may
be
an
incumbrance
it
appears
at
any
rate
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
such
an
honour
that
it
should
be
loaded
with
court
expenses
in
its
very
creation
i
hope
that
the
principle
stated
in
may
serve
as
precedent
on
this
occasion
i
am
dear
sir
your
very
faithful
servant
airy
right
honourable
sir
lewis
no
intimation
however
was
received
that
the
fees
would
be
remitted
on
the
present
occasion
and
after
consideration
the
proposed
knighthood
was
declined
in
the
following
letter
royal
observatory
greenwich
april
dear
sir
i
have
frequently
reflected
on
the
proposal
made
by
you
of
the
honour
of
knighthood
to
myself
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
the
favourable
opinion
which
you
entertain
in
regard
to
my
supposed
claims
to
notice
and
for
the
kindness
with
which
you
proposed
publicly
to
express
it
but
on
consideration
i
am
strongly
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
the
conditions
attached
by
established
regulation
to
the
conferring
of
such
an
honour
would
be
unacceptable
to
me
and
that
the
honour
itself
would
in
reality
under
the
circumstances
of
my
and
in
my
social
position
be
an
incumbrance
to
me
and
finally
i
have
thought
it
best
most
respectfully
and
with
a
full
sense
of
the
kindness
of
yourself
and
of
the
queen
government
towards
me
to
ask
that
the
proposal
might
be
deferred
there
is
another
direction
in
which
a
step
might
be
made
affecting
my
personal
position
in
a
smaller
degree
but
not
tending
to
incommode
me
which
i
would
ask
leave
to
submit
to
your
consideration
it
is
the
definition
of
the
rank
of
the
astronomer
royal
the
singular
character
of
the
office
removes
it
from
ordinary
rules
of
rank
and
sometimes
may
produce
a
disagreeable
contest
of
opinions
the
only
offices
of
similar
character
corresponding
in
other
conditions
to
that
of
the
british
astronomer
royal
are
those
of
the
imperial
astronomers
at
pulkowa
st
petersburg
and
paris
in
russia
where
every
rank
is
clearly
defined
by
that
of
military
grade
the
imperial
astronomer
has
the
rank
of
in
france
the
definition
is
less
precise
but
the
present
imperial
astronomer
has
been
created
as
an
attachment
of
rank
to
the
office
a
senator
of
the
empire
i
am
dear
sir
your
very
faithful
servant
airy
rt
hon
sir
george
lewis
sir
lewis
died
before
receiving
this
letter
and
the
letter
was
afterwards
forwarded
to
lord
palmerston
some
correspondence
followed
between
lord
palmerston
and
airy
on
the
subject
of
attaching
a
definite
rank
to
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
as
proposed
in
the
above
letter
but
the
home
office
for
various
reasons
set
forth
stated
that
the
suggestion
could
not
be
complied
with
and
the
whole
subject
dropped
the
following
remarks
are
extracted
from
the
report
of
the
astronomer
royal
to
the
board
of
in
a
very
heavy
squall
which
occurred
in
the
gale
of
december
of
last
year
the
stay
of
the
lofty
iron
pillar
outside
of
the
park
rails
which
carried
our
telegraph
wires
gave
way
and
the
pillar
and
the
whole
system
of
wires
fell
an
important
alteration
has
been
made
in
the
magnetic
observatory
for
several
years
past
various
plans
have
been
under
consideration
for
preventing
large
changes
of
temperature
in
the
room
which
contains
the
magnetic
instruments
at
length
i
determined
to
excavate
a
subterraneous
room
or
cellar
under
the
original
room
the
work
was
begun
in
the
last
week
in
january
and
in
all
important
points
it
is
now
finished
in
the
late
spring
some
alarm
was
occasioned
by
the
discovery
that
the
parliamentary
standard
of
the
pound
weight
had
become
coated
with
an
extraneous
substance
produced
by
the
decomposition
of
the
lining
of
the
case
in
which
it
was
preserved
it
was
decided
immediately
to
compare
it
with
the
three
parliamentary
copies
of
which
that
at
the
observatory
is
one
the
national
standard
was
found
to
be
entirely
uninjured
on
november
of
last
year
the
transit
instrument
narrowly
escaped
serious
injury
from
an
accident
the
plate
chain
which
carries
the
large
western
counterpoise
broke
the
counterpoise
fell
upon
the
pier
destroying
the
massive
wheels
of
the
lifting
machinery
but
was
prevented
from
falling
further
by
the
iron
stay
of
the
flue
the
prismatic
had
been
completed
in
achromatic
are
placed
on
both
sides
of
the
prism
so
that
each
pencil
of
light
through
the
prism
consists
of
parallel
rays
and
breadth
is
given
to
the
spectrum
by
a
cylindrical
lens
the
spectral
lines
are
seen
straighter
than
before
and
generally
it
is
believed
that
their
definition
is
improved
for
observation
of
the
small
planets
a
convention
has
been
made
with
le
verrier
from
new
moon
to
full
moon
all
the
small
planets
visible
to
are
observed
at
the
royal
observatory
of
greenwich
from
full
moon
to
new
moon
all
are
observed
at
the
imperial
observatory
of
paris
the
relief
gained
in
this
way
is
very
considerable
in
determining
the
variations
in
the
power
of
the
and
magnets
depending
on
temperature
it
was
found
by
experiment
that
this
depended
materially
on
whether
the
magnet
was
heated
by
air
or
by
water
and
result
of
these
experiments
with
air
is
to
give
a
coefficient
for
temperature
correction
four
or
five
times
as
great
as
that
given
by
the
with
regard
to
the
discordances
of
the
results
of
observations
of
experiments
had
been
made
with
needles
whose
breadth
was
in
the
plane
passing
through
the
axis
of
rotation
and
it
appeared
that
the
means
of
extreme
discordances
were
for
an
ordinary
needle
and
for
a
flat
needle
and
the
report
continues
thus
after
this
i
need
not
say
that
i
consider
it
certain
that
the
small
probable
errors
which
have
been
attributed
to
ordinary
needles
are
a
pure
delusion
the
report
states
that
in
the
various
operations
connected
with
the
trials
and
repairs
of
chronometers
and
the
system
of
transmitted
to
various
and
clocks
about
of
the
strength
of
the
observatory
is
employed
and
it
continues
thus
viewing
the
close
dependence
of
nautical
astronomy
upon
accurate
knowledge
of
time
there
is
perhaps
no
department
of
the
observatory
which
answers
more
completely
to
the
original
utilitarian
intentions
of
the
founder
of
the
royal
observatory
with
regard
to
the
proposal
of
at
the
start
point
it
appears
that
communications
referring
to
this
proposal
had
passed
between
the
board
of
admiralty
and
the
board
of
trade
of
which
the
conclusion
was
that
the
board
of
trade
possessed
no
funds
applicable
to
the
defraying
of
the
expenses
attending
the
execution
of
the
scheme
and
the
admiralty
did
not
at
present
contemplate
the
establishment
of
these
under
their
own
authority
amongst
other
papers
in
this
year
paper
entitled
first
analysis
of
magnetic
storms
was
read
before
the
royal
society
of
private
history

was

daughter
hilda
was
married
to
mr
routh
fellow
of
st
peter
college
cambridge
at
greenwich
parish
church
they
afterwards
resided
at
cambridge
our
telegraphic
communications
of
every
kind
were
again
destroyed
by
a
and
gale
of
wind
which
occurred
on
and
which
broke
down
nearly
all
the
posts
between
the
royal
observatory
and
the
greenwich
railway
the
report
to
the
visitors
states
that
only
change
of
buildings
which
i
contemplate
as
at
present
required
is
the
erection
of
a
chronometer
room
the
pecuniary
value
of
chronometers
stored
in
the
observatory
is
sometimes
perhaps
as
much
as
the
south
eastern
and
london
chatham
and
dover
scheme
for
a
railway
through
the
park
was
again
brought
forward
there
was
a
meeting
of
sir
hanmer
committee
at
the
observatory
on
may
mr
stone
was
sent
hastily
to
dublin
to
make
observations
on
by
railways
there
i
had
been
before
the
committee
on
may
on
i
approved
of
an
amended
plan
in
reference
to
this
matter
the
report
states
that
is
proper
to
remark
that
the
shake
of
the
altazimuth
felt
in
the
earthquake
of
when
no
such
shake
was
felt
with
instruments
nearer
to
the
ground
an
experience
which
as
i
have
heard
on
private
authority
is
supported
by
observation
of
artificial
tremors
gives
reason
to
fear
that
at
distances
from
a
railway
which
would
sufficiently
defend
the
lower
instruments
the
loftier
instruments
as
the
altazimuth
and
the
equatoreals
would
be
sensibly
affected
some
of
the
magnets
had
been
suspended
by
steel
wires
instead
of
silk
of
no
greater
strength
than
was
necessary
for
safety
and
the
report
states
that
the
pressure
of
business
the
determination
of
various
constants
of
adjustment
was
deferred
to
the
end
of
the
year
the
immediate
results
of
observation
however
began
to
excite
suspicion
and
after
a
time
it
was
found
that
in
spite
of
the
length
of
the
suspending
wire
about
feet
the
was
not
much
less
than
the
wires
were
promptly
dismounted
and
silk
skeins
substituted
for
them
with
these
the
is
about
the
which
had
given
great
trouble
by
the
irregularities
of
the

been
compared
with
two
from
kew
observatory
which
gave
very
good
and
accordant
results

that
mr
simms
by
whom
our
instruments
now
in
use
were
prepared
and
who
had
personally
witnessed
our
former
difficulties
was
present
during
some
of
these
experiments
our
own
instrument
being
placed
in
his
hands
to
for
another
purpose
he
spontaneously
the
apparently
faultless
to
my
great
astonishment
the
inconsistencies
of
every
kind
have
nearly
or
entirely
vanished
on
raising
and
lowering
the
needles
they
return
to
the
same
readings
and
the
dips
with
the
same
needle
appear
generally
consistent
some
practical
details
of
the
polishing
process
by
which
this
result
had
been
secured
are
then
after
numerous
delays
the
apparatus
for
the
of

was
brought
into
a
working

the
month
of

on

tried
at

once
in
the
heat
of
the
the
temperature
being
usually
limited
to
fahrenheit
and
guided
by
the
results
of
very
long
experience
we
have
established
it
as
a
rule
that
every
trial
in
heat
be
continued
through
three
weeks
only
employment
extraneous
to
the
observatory
which
has
occupied
any
of
my
time
within
the
last
year
is
the
giving
three
lectures
on
the
magnetism
of
iron
ships
at
the
request
of
the
lords
of
the
committee
of
council
on
education
in
the
theatre
of
the
south
kensington
museum
the
preparations
however
for
these
lectures
to
be
given
in
a
room
to
them
occupied
a
great
deal
of
my
own
time
and
of
the
time
of
an
assistant
of
the
observatory
to
a
matter
in
which
the
interests
of
astronomy
are
deeply
concerned
i
think
it
right
to
report
to
the
visitors
my
late
representation
to
the
government
to
the
effect
that
in
reference
to
possible
observation
of
the
transit
of
venus
in
it
will
be
necessary
in
no
long
time
to
examine
the
coasts
of
the
great
southern
continent
of
private
history
there
were
the
usual
visits
to
playford
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
from
june
to
i
was
on
a
trip
in
wales
with
my
sons
hubert
and
from
to
i
was
staying
with
most
of
my
family
at
portinscale
near
keswick
we
returned
by
barnard
castle
rokeby
chapter
viii
at
greenwich
observatory
to
in
this
year
the
cube
of
the
transit
circle
was
pierced
to
permit
reciprocal
observations
of
the
collimators
without
raising
the
instrument
this
involved
the
construction
of
improved
collimators
which
formed
the
subject
of
a
special
address
to
the
members
of
the
board
of
visitors
on
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
it
appears
that
on
may
a
thunderstorm
of
great
violence
passed
very
close
to
the
observatory
after
one
flash
of
lightning
i
was
convinced
that
the
principal
building
was
struck
several
galvanometers
in
the
magnetic
basement
were
destroyed
lately
it
has
been
remarked
that
one
of
the
old
chimneys
of
the
principal
building
had
been
dislocated
and
slightly
twisted
at
a
place
where
it
was
surrounded
by
an
iron
led
from
the
telegraph
pole
which
was
planted
upon
the
leads
of
the
octagon
room
on
consideration
of
the
serious
interruptions
to
which
we
have
several
times
been
exposed
from
the
destruction
of
our
through
and
gales
i
have
made
an
arrangement
for
leading
the
whole
of
our
wires
in
underground
pipes
as
far
as
the
greenwich
railway
station
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
to
whom
the
greenwich
and
woolwich
line
of
the
south
eastern
railway
was
referred
finally
assented
to
the
adoption
of
a
line
which
i
indicated
passing
between
the
buildings
of
the
hospital
schools
and
the
public
road
to
woolwich
the
galvanic
chronometer
attached
to
the
equatoreal
often
gave
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
at
last
i
determined
on
the
proposal
of
mr
ellis
to
attempt
an
extension
of
mr
regulating
principle
it
is
well
known
that
mr
jones
has
with
great
success
introduced
the
system
of
applying
galvanic
currents
originating
in
the
vibrations
of
a
normal
pendulum
not
to
drive
the
wheelwork
of
other
clocks
but
to
regulate
to
exact
agreement
the
rates
of
their
pendulums
which
were
independently
nearly
in
agreement
each
clock
being
driven
by
as
before
the
same
principle
is
now
applied
to
the
chronometer
the
construction
is
perfectly
successful
the
chronometer
remains
in
coincidence
with
the
transit
clock
through
any
length
of
time
with
a
small
constant
error
as
is
required
by
mechanical
theory
the
printed
volume
of
observations
for
has
two
appendixes
one
containing
the
calculations
of
the
value
of
the
moon
deduced
from
occultations
observed
at
cambridge
and
greenwich
from
to
and
shewing
that
the
occultation
is
less
than
the
telescopic

the
other
containing
the
reduction
of
the
planetary
observations
made
at
the
royal
observatory
in
the
years
filling
up
the
gap
between
the
planetary
reductions
made
several
years
ago
under
my
superintendence
and
the
reductions
contained
in
the
greenwich
volumes
to
the
present
time
and
conducted
on
the
same
general
principles
some
trouble
had
been
found
in
regulating
the
temperature
of
the
magnetic
basement
but
it
was
anticipated
that
in
future
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
keeping
down
the
annual
variation
within
about
and
the
diurnal
variation
within
longitudes
in
america

determined
in
this
year

june
to
july
he
was
on
an
expedition
in
norway
with
his
son
osmund
and
his
nephew
gorell
there
was
probably
a
short
stay
at
playford
in
the
winter
in
this
and
in
the
previous
year
the
investigations
of
colenso
the
bishop
of
natal
had
attracted
much
notice
and
had
procured
him
the
virulent
hostility
of
a
numerous
section
his
income
was
withheld
from
him
and
in
consequence
a
subscription
fund
was
raised
for
his
support
by
his
admirers
airy
who
always
took
the
liberal
side
in
such
questions
was
a
subscriber
to
the
fund
and
wrote
the
following
letter
to
the
bishop
royal
observatory
greenwich
july
my
lord
with
many
thanks
i
have
to
acknowledge
your
kind
recollection
of
me
in
sending
as
a
presentation
copy
the
work
on
joshua
judges
and
especially
on
the
divided
authorship
of
genesis
a
work
whose
investigations
founded
in
great
measure
on
severe
and
extensive
verbal
criticism
will
apparently
bear
comparison
with
your
most
remarkable
examination
of
deuteronomy
i
should
however
not
do
justice
to
my
own
appreciation
if
i
did
not
remark
that
there
are
other
points
considered
which
have
long
been
matters
of
interest
to
me
on
several
matters
some
of
them
important
my
present
conclusions
do
not
absolutely
agree
with
your
lordship
but
i
am
not
the
less
grateful
for
the
amount
of
erudition
and
thought
carefully
directed
to
definite
points
and
above
all
for
the
noble
example
of
unwearied
research
and
freedom
in
stating
its
consequences
in
reference
to
subjects
which
scarcely
ever
occupy
the
attention
of
the
clergy
in
our
country
i
am
my
lord
yours
very
faithfully
airy
lord
bishop
of
here
also
is
a
letter
on
the
same
subject
written
to
professor
selwyn
professor
of
divinity
at
cambridge
royal
observatory
greenwich
london
may
my
dear
sir
the
concerning
colenso
duly
arrived
i
note
your
remarks
on
the
merits
of
colenso
i
do
not
write
to
tell
you
that
i
differ
from
you
but
to
tell
you
why
i
differ
i
think
that
you
do
not
make
the
proper
distinction
between
a
person
who
invents
or
introduces
a
tool
and
the
person
who
uses
it
the
most
resolute
antigravitationist
that
ever
lived
might
yet
acknowledge
his
debt
to
newton
for
the
method
of
prime
and
ultimate
ratios
and
the
principles
of
fluxions
by
which
newton
sought
to
establish
gravitation
so
let
it
be
with
colenso
he
has
given
me
a
power
of
tracing
out
truth
to
a
certain
extent
which
i
never
could
have
obtained
without
him
and
for
this
i
am
very
grateful
as
to
the
further
employment
of
this
power
you
know
that
he
and
i
use
it
to
totally
different
purposes
but
not
the
less
do
i
say
that
i
owe
to
him
a
new
intellectual
power
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
sudden
disruption
of
the
old
traditional
view
seems
to
have
unhinged
his
mind
and
to
have
sent
him
too
far
on
the
other
side
i
would
not
give
a
pin
for
his
judgment
nevertheless
i
wish
he
would
go
over
the
three
remaining
books
of
the
tetrateuch
i
know
something
of
myers
but
i
should
not
have
thought
him
likely
to
produce
anything
sound
on
such
things
as
the
hebrew
scriptures
i
never
saw
his
thoughts
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
airy
the
following
letter
has
reference
to
airy
proposal
to
introduce
certain
subjects
into
the
examination
for
honors
at
cambridge
on
various
occasions
he
sharply
criticized
the
papers
set
for
the
examination
and
the
smith
prize
examination
and
greatly
lamented
the
growing
importance
of
pure
mathematics
and
the
comparative
exclusion
of
physical
questions
in
those
examinations
his
proposal
as
finally
submitted
in
the
letter
that
follows
was
somewhat
modified
as
regards
the
mode
of
introducing
the
subjects
from
his
original
draft
in
deference
to
the
opinions
of
whewell
adams
routh
and
other
friends
to
whom
he
had
submitted
it
his
proposal
was
favourably
received
by
the
mathematical
board
and
recommendations
were
made
in
the
direction
though
not
to
the
extent
that
he
desired
and
he
subsequently
submitted
a
memorandum
on
those
recommendations
royal
observatory
greenwich
may
my
dear
sir
you
will
perceive
from
perusal
of
the
enclosed
paper
that
i
have
acted
on
the
permission
which
you
kindly
gave
me
to
transmit
to
you
my
proposal
for
extension
of
the
mathematical
education
of
the
university
in
the
physical
direction
it
is
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
the
structure
of
the
university
that
studies
there
will
have
a
tendency
to
take
an
unpractical
form
depending
much
on
the
personal
tastes
of
special
examiners
i
trust
that
as
a
person
whose
long
separation
from
the
daily
business
of
the
university
has
enabled
him
to
see
in
some
measure
the
wants
of
the
external
scientific
and
practical
world
i
may
be
forgiven
this
attempt
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
university
my
ideas
on
the
points
towards
which
their
attention
might
perhaps
be
advantageously
turned
i
am
my
dear
sir
very
faithfully
yours
airy
rev
dr
cartmell
master
of
christ
college
and
royal
observatory
greenwich
may
my
dear
mr
about
two
years
ago
by
the
kindness
of
the
university
an
opportunity
was
presented
to
me
of
orally
stating
what
i
conceived
to
be
deficiencies
in
the
educational
course
of
the
university
as
regards
mathematical
physics
since
that
time
the
consideration
of
those
deficiencies
which
had
long
been
present
to
me
has
urged
itself
on
my
attention
with
greater
force
and
finally
i
have
entertained
the
idea
that
i
might
without
impropriety
communicate
to
you
my
opinion
in
a
less
fugitive
form
than
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
have
alluded
with
the
request
that
if
you
should
deem
such
a
course
appropriate
you
would
bring
it
before
the
board
of
mathematical
studies
and
perhaps
ultimately
make
it
known
to
the
resident
members
of
the
senate
i
will
first
give
the
list
of
subjects
which
i
should
wish
to
see
introduced
and
to
the
prosecution
of
which
the
generally
admirable
course
of
the
university
is
remarkably
well
adapted
and
i
will
then
without
entering
into
every
detail
advert
to
the
process
by
which
i
think
it
probable
the
introduction
of
these
subjects
could
be
effected
in
the
following
list
the
first
head
is
purely
algebraical
and
the
second
nearly
so
but
they
are
closely
related
to
observational
science
and
to
the
physical
subjects
which
follow
some
of
the
subjects
which
i
exhibit
on
my
list
are
partially
but
in
my
opinion
imperfectly
taught
at
present
i
entirely
omit
from
my
list
physical
optics
geometrical
astronomy
and
gravitational
astronomy
of
points
because
to
the
extent
to
which
academical
education
ought
to
go
i
believe
that
there
is
no
teaching
on
these
sciences
comparable
to
that
in
the
university
of
cambridge
it
is
of
course
still
possible
that
improvements
may
be
made
in
the
books
commonly
used
it
might
however
be
a
question
whether
as
regards
the
time
and
manner
of
teaching
them
some
parts
of
these
subjects
might
ultimately
be
associated
with
the
other
subjects
included
in
my
list
i
of
subjects
proposed
for
partial
differential
equations
to
the
second
order
with
their
arbitrary
functions
selected
principally
with
reference
to
the
physical
subjects
the
theory
of
probabilities
as
applied
to
the
combination
of
observations
mechanics
including
hydraulic
powers
in
the
state
which
verges
upon
practical
application
and
especially
including
that
part
in
which
the
abstract
ideas
of
and
occur
attractions
this
subject
is
recognized
in
the
existing
course
of
the
university
but
so
far
as
i
can
infer
from
it
appears
to
be
very
lightly
passed
over
the
figure
of
the
earth
and
its
consequences
precession
i
believe
that
the
proposal
is
sanctioned
of
adopting
some
part
of
this
theory
in
the
ordinary
course
but
perhaps
hardly
so
far
as
is
desirable
the
tides
waves
of
water
sound
beginning
with
newton
investigation
echoes
pipes
and
vibrating
strings
acoustics
the
mathematical
part
of
music
magnetism
terrestrial
and
experimental
and
their
connection
i
omit
for
the
present
mineralogy
and
mathematical
electricity
this
list
of
subjects
appears
formidable
but
they
are
in
reality
easy
and
would
be
mastered
in
a
short
time
by
the
higher
wranglers
ii
of
introducing
these
subjects
into
the
after
much
consideration
and
after
learning
the
opinions
of
several
persons
whose
judgment
claims
my
deepest
respect
i
propose
the
gradual
introduction
of
these
subjects
into
the
examination
for
honors
at
admission
to
the
degree
as
soon
as
the
preparation
of
books
and
the
readiness
of
examiners
shall
enable
the
university
to
take
that
step
i
conceive
that
by
a
judicious
pruning
of
the
somewhat
luxuriant
growth
of
pure
algebra
analytical
geometry
and
mere
problems
sufficient
leisure
may
be
gained
for
the
studies
of
the
undergraduates
and
sufficient
time
for
the
questions
of
the
examiners
i
do
not
contemplate
that
the
students
could
advance
very
far
into
the
subjects
but
i
know
the
importance
of
beginning
them
and
judging
from
the
train
of
thoughts
of
reading
and
of
conversation
among
the
bachelors
with
whom
i
associated
many
years
ago
i
believe
that
there
is
quite
a
sufficient
number
who
will
be
anxious
to
go
deep
into
the
subjects
if
they
have
once
entered
into
them
if
six
wranglers
annually
would
take
them
up
my
point
would
be
gained
the
part
which
these
gentlemen
might
be
expected
in
a
short
time
to
take
in
the
government
of
the
university
would
enable
them
soon
to
act
steadily
upon
the
university
course
the
efficiency
of
the
university
instruction
would
be
increased
and
the
external
character
of
the
university
would
be
raised
the
real
difficulties
and
they
are
not
light
ones
would
probably
be
found
in
providing
examiners
and
books
at
present
both
are
wanting
within
the
university
where
there
is
a
great
and
objection
to
intrusting
examinations
to
persons
foreign
to
the
university
and
where
the
books
have
to
be
created
with
labour
and
with
absolute
outlay
of
money
for
their
sale
could
never
be
remunerative
the
progress
must
be
slow
still
progress
would
be
certain
if
the
authorities
of
the
university
should
think
the
matter
deserving
of
their
hearty
encouragement
requesting
that
you
and
the
members
of
the
university
will
accept
this
proposal
as
an
indication
of
my
deep
attachment
to
my
university
i
am
my
dear
mr
your
very
faithful
servant
airy
rev
dr
cartmell
of
the
university
of
in
this
year
it
was
arranged
that
my
treasury
accounts
were
to
be
transferred
to
the
admiralty
making
the
simplification
which
i
had
so
long
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
it
appears
that
a
relic
of
the
geodetic
operations
commenced
in
for
connecting
the
observatories
of
greenwich
and
paris
in
the
shape
of
an
observing
cabin
on
the
roof
of
the
octagon
room
was
shifted
and
supported
in
such
a
manner
that
the
pressure
on
the
flat
roof
was
entirely
with
regard
to
the
transit
circle
the
new
collimators
with
telescopes
of
seven
inches
aperture
had
been
mounted
when
the
transit
telescope
directed
vertically
is
interposed
the
interruptions
in
the
central
cube
impair
the
sharpness
of
definition
still
leaving
it
abundantly
good
for
general
use
it
had
been
regarded
as
probable
that
the
astronomical
flexure
of
the
telescope
after
cutting
away
small
portions
of
the
central
cube
would
be
found
sensibly
changed
and
this
proved
to
be
the
case
the
difference
of
flexures
of
the
two
ends
has
been
altered
more
than
a
second
of
referring
to
a
new
portable
altazimuth

had
lately
been
tested

report
states
as

may
mention
that

circle
of
a
small
altazimuth

used
by
me
and
an
inspection
of
the
operations
in

convinced
me
that
the
principal
error
to
be
feared
in
instruments
of
this
class
is
ovality
of
the
graduated
limb
this
can
not
be
eliminated
by
two
microscopes
and
such
an
instrument
should
never
be
fitted

by

are
much
more
delicate

were
carefully
determined

to
the
gradual
improvement
in
the
steadiness

the
effect
of
this
movement
will
be
that
millions
of
useless
observations
will
be
added
to
the
millions
that
already
exist

whether
something
may
be
expected
to
result
which
will
lead
to
a
meteorological
theory
i
can
not
hazard
a
conjecture
this
only
i
believe
that
it
will
be
useless
at
present
to
attempt
a
process
of
mechanical
theory
and
that
all
that
can
be
done
must
be
to
connect
phenomena
by
laws
of
induction
but
the
induction
must
be
carried
out
by
numerous
and
troublesome
trials
in
different
directions
the
greater
part
of
which
would
probably
be
failures

my

much
gratified
by
your

received
this

the
notice
that
the

and
sixteen
senior

had
elected
me
under

as
honorary

of

it
has
always
been
my
wish
to
maintain
a
friendly
connection
with
my
college
and
i
am
delighted
to
receive
this
response
from
the

the
peculiar
form
in
which
the
reference
to
the
statute
enables
them
to
put
it
renders
it
doubly
pleasing
as
the
statute
is
new
i
should
be
obliged
by
a
copy
of
it
and
at
any
convenient
time
i
should
be
glad
to
know
the
name
of
the
person
with
whom
i
am
so
honorably
associated
i
am
my
dear
master
very
faithfully
yours
airy
consequent
on
airy
proposals
in
for
the
introduction
of
new
physical
subjects
into
the
examination
and
his
desire
that
the
large
number
of
questions
set
in
pure
mathematics
or
as
he
termed
it
useless
algebra
should
be
curtailed
there
was
a
smart
and
interesting
correspondence
between
him
and
cayley
who
was
the
great
exponent
and
advocate
of
pure
mathematics
at
cambridge
both
of
them
were
men
of
the
highest
mathematical
powers
but
diametrically
opposed
in
their
views
of
the
use
of
mathematics
airy
regarded
mathematics
as
simply
a
useful
machine
for
the
solution
of
practical
problems
and
arriving
at
practical
results
he
had
a
great
respect
for
pure
mathematics
and
all
the
processes
of
algebra
so
far
as
they
aided
him
to
solve
his
problems
and
to
arrive
at
useful
results
but
he
had
a
positive
aversion
to
mathematical
investigations
however
skilful
and
elaborate
for
which
no
immediate
practical
value
could
be
claimed
cayley
on
the
contrary
regarded
mathematics
as
a
useful
exercise
for
the
mind
apart
from
any
immediate
practical
object
and
he
considered
that
the
general
command
of
mathematics
gained
by
handling
abstruse
mathematical
investigations
though
barren
in
themselves
would
be
valuable
for
whatever
purpose
mathematics
might
be
required
he
also
thought
it
likely
that
his
researches
and
advances
in
the
field
of
pure
mathematics
might
facilitate
the
solution
of
physical
problems
and
tend
to
the
progress
of
the
practical
sciences
their
different
views
on
this
subject
will
be
seen
from
the
letters
that
follow
royal
observatory
greenwich
london
my
dear
sir
i
think
it
best
to
put
in
writing
the
purport
of
what
i
have
said
or
have
intended
to
say
in
reference
to
the
mathematical
studies
in
the
university
first
i
will
remark
on
the
study
of
partial
differential
equations
i
do
not
know
that
one
branch
of
pure
mathematics
can
be
considered
higher
than
another
except
in
the
utility
of
the
power
which
it
gives
measured
thus
the
partial
differential
equations
are
very
useful
and
therefore
stand
very
high
as
far
as
the
second
order
they
apply
to
that
point
in
the
most
important
way
to
the
great
problems
of
nature
concerning
and
division
of
and
and
are
worthy
of
the
most
careful
study
beyond
that
order
they
apply
to
nothing
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
study
to
the
second
order
and
at
the
same
time
working
it
carefully
philosophically
and
practically
up
to
that
point
that
i
drew
up
my
little
work
on
the
general
question
of
mathematical
studies
i
will
first
give
my
leading
ideas
on
what
i
may
call
the
moral
part
i
think
that
a
heavy
responsibility
rests
on
the
persons
who
influence
most
strongly
the
course
of
education
in
the
university
to
direct
that
course
in
the
way
in
which
it
will
be
most
useful
to
the
students
in
the
two
ways
of
disciplining
their
powers
and
habits
and
of
giving
them
scientific
knowledge
of
the
highest
and
most
accurate
order
applying
to
the
phenomena
of
nature
such
as
will
be
useful
to
them
through
life
i
do
not
think
that
the
mere
personal
taste
of
a
teacher
is
sufficient
justification
for
a
special
course
unless
it
has
been
adopted
under
a
consideration
of
that
responsibility
now
i
can
say
for
myself
that
i
have
for
some
years
inspected
the
examination
papers
and
have
considered
the
bearing
of
the
course
which
they
imply
upon
the
education
of
the
student
and
am
firmly
convinced
that
as
regards
men
below
the
very
few
first
say
below
the
ten
first
there
is
a
prodigious
loss
of
time
without
any
permanent
good
whatever
for
the
great
majority
of
men
such
subjects
as
abstract
analytical
geometry
perish
at
once
with
men
like
adams
and
stokes
they
remain
and
are
advantageous
but
probably
there
is
not
a
single
man
beside
them
of
their
respective
years
who
remembers
a
bit
or
who
if
he
remembers
them
has
the
leisure
and
other
opportunities
of
applying
them
i
believe
on
the
other
hand
that
a
careful
selection
of
physical
subjects
would
enable
the
university
to
communicate
to
its
students
a
vast
amount
of
information
of
accurate
kind
and
requiring
the
most
logical
treatment
but
so
bearing
upon
the
natural
phenomena
which
are
constantly
before
us
that
it
would
be
felt
by
every
student
to
possess
a
real
value
that
from
that
circumstance
it
would
dwell
in
his
mind
and
that
it
would
enable
him
to
correct
a
great
amount
of
flimsy
education
in
the
country
and
so
far
to
raise
the
national
character
the
consideration
of
the
education
of
the
reasoning
habits
suggests
ideas
far
from
favourable
to
the
existing
course
i
am
old
enough
to
remember
the
time
of
mere
geometrical
processes
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
for
the
cultivation
of
accurate
mental
discipline
they
were
far
superior
to
the
operations
in
vogue
at
the
present
day
there
is
no
subject
in
the
world
more
favourable
to
logical
habit
than
the
differential
calculus
in
all
its
branches
logically
worked
in
its
and
i
think
that
its
applications
to
various
physical
subjects
compelling
from
time
to
time
an
attention
to
the
elementary
grounds
of
the
calculus
would
be
far
more
advantageous
to
that
logical
habit
than
the
simple
applications
to
pure
equations
and
pure
algebraical
geometry
now
occupying
so
much
attention
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
airy
dear
sir
i
have
been
intending
to
answer
your
letter
of
the
november
so
far
as
it
is
if
at
all
personal
to
myself
i
would
remark
that
the
statutory
duty
of
the
sadlerian
professor
is
that
he
shall
explain
and
teach
the
principles
of
pure
mathematics
and
apply
himself
to
the
advancement
of
the
science
as
to
partial
differential
equations
they
are
high
as
being
an
inverse
problem
and
perhaps
the
most
difficult
inverse
problem
that
has
been
dealt
with
in
regard
to
the
limitation
of
them
to
the
second
order
whatever
other
reasons
exist
for
it
there
is
also
the
reason
that
the
theory
to
this
order
is
as
yet
so
incomplete
that
there
is
no
inducement
to
go
beyond
it
there
could
hardly
be
a
more
valuable
step
than
anything
which
would
give
a
notion
of
the
form
of
the
general
integral
of
a
partial
differential
equation
of
the
second
order
i
can
not
but
differ
from
you
as
to
the
educational
value
of
analytical
geometry
or
i
would
rather
say
of
modern
geometry
generally
it
appears
to
me
that
in
the
physical
sciences
depending
on
partial
differential
equations
there
is
scarcely
anything
that
a
student
can
do
for
himself
he
finds
the
integral
of
the
ordinary
equation
for
sound
if
he
wishes
to
go
a
step
further
and
integrate
the
equation
he
is
simply
unable
to
do
so
and
so
in
other
cases
there
is
nothing
that
he
can
add
to
what
he
finds
in
his
books
whereas
geometry
of
course
to
an
intelligent
student
is
a
real
inductive
and
deductive
science
of
inexhaustible
extent
in
which
he
can
experiment
for
himself
the
very
tracing
of
a
curve
from
its
equation
and
still
more
the
consideration
of
the
cases
belonging
to
different
values
of
the
parameters
is
the
construction
of
a
theory
to
bind
together
the
facts
and
the
selection
of
a
curve
or
surface
proper
for
the
verification
of
any
general
theorem
is
the
selection
of
an
experiment
in
proof
or
disproof
of
a
theory
i
do
not
quite
understand
your
reference
to
stokes
and
adams
as
types
of
the
men
who
alone
retain
their
abstract
analytical
geometry
if
a
man
when
he
takes
his
degree
drops
mathematics
he
drops
geometry
but
if
not
i
think
for
the
above
reasons
that
he
is
more
likely
to
go
on
with
it
than
with
almost
any
other
subject
and
any
mathematical
journal
will
shew
that
a
very
great
amount
of
attention
is
in
fact
given
to
geometry
and
the
subject
is
in
a
very
high
degree
a
progressive
one
quite
as
much
as
to
physics
one
may
apply
to
it
the
lines
yet
i
doubt
not
thro
the
ages
one
increasing
purpose
runs

i
remain
dear

very
sincerely

december
my
dear
sir
i
have
received
with
much
pleasure
your
letter
of
december
in
this
university
discussion
i
have
acted
only
in
public
and
have
not
made
private
communication
to
any
person
whatever
till
required
to
do
so
by
private
letter
addressed
to
me
your
few
words
in
queens
hall
seemed
to
expect
a
little
reply
now
as
to
the
modern
geometry
with
your
praises
of
this
science
as
to
the
room
for
extension
in
induction
and
deduction
and
with
your
facts
as
to
the
amount
of
space
which
it
occupies
in
mathematical
journals
i
entirely
agree
and
if
men
after
leaving
cambridge
were
designed
to
shut
themselves
up
in
a
cavern
they
could
have
nothing
better
for
their
subjective
amusement
they
might
have
other
things
as
good
enormous
complication
and
probably
beautiful
investigation
might
be
found
in
varying
the
game
of
billiards
with
novel
islands
on
a
newly
shaped
billiard
table
but
the
persons
who
devote
themselves
to
these
subjects
do
thereby
separate
themselves
from
the
world
they
make
no
step
towards
natural
science
or
utilitarian
science
the
two
subjects
which
the
world
specially
desires
the
world
could
go
on
as
well
without
these
separatists
now
if
these
persons
lived
only
for
themselves
no
other
person
would
have
any
title
to
question
or
remark
on
their
devotion
to
this
barren
subject
but
a
cambridge
examiner
is
not
in
that
position
the
university
is
a
national
body
for
education
of
young
men
and
the
power
of
a
cambridge
examiner
is
omnipotent
in
directing
the
education
of
the
young
men
and
his
responsibility
to
the
cause
of
education
is
very
distinct
and
very
strong
and
the
question
for
him
to
consider
is
in
the
sense
in
which
mathematical
education
is
desired
by
the
best
authorities
in
the
nation
is
the
course
taken
by
this
national
institution
satisfactory
to
the
nation
i
express
my
belief
that
it
is
satisfactory
i
believe
that
many
of
the
best
men
of
the
nation
consider
that
a
great
deal
of
time
is
lost
on
subjects
which
they
esteem
as
puerile
and
that
much
of
that
time
might
be
employed
on
noble
and
useful
science
you
may
remember
that
the
commissions
which
have
visited
cambridge
originated
in
a
memorial
addressed
to
the
government
by
men
of
respected
scientific
character
sabine
was
one
and
i
may
take
him
as
the
representative
he
is
a
man
of
extensive
knowledge
of
the
application
of
mathematics
as
it
has
been
employed
for
many
years
in
the
science
of
the
world
but
he
has
no
profundity
of
science
he
as
i
believe
desired
to
find
persons
who
could
enter
accurately
into
mathematical
science
and
naturally
looked
to
the
great
mathematical
university
but
he
must
have
been
much
disappointed
so
much
time
is
swallowed
up
by
the
forced
study
of
the
pure
mathematics
that
it
is
not
easy
to
find
anybody
who
can
really
enter
on
these
subjects
in
which
men
of
science
want
assistance
and
so
sabine
thought
that
the
government
ought
to
interfere
probably
without
any
clear
idea
of
what
they
could
do
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
airy
dear
sir
i
have
to
thank
you
for
your
last
letter
i
do
not
think
everything
should
be
subordinated
to
the
educational
element
my
idea
of
a
university
is
that
of
a
place
for
the
cultivation
of
all
science
therefore
among
other
sciences
pure
mathematics
including
whatever
is
interesting
as
part
of
this
science
i
am
bound
therefore
to
admit
that
your
proposed
extension
of
the
problem
of
billiards
were
found
susceptible
of
interesting
mathematical
developments
would
be
a
fit
subject
of
study
but
in
this
case
i
do
not
think
the
problem
could
fairly
be
objected
to
as
puerile
a
more
legitimate
objection
would
i
conceive
be
its
extreme
speciality
but
this
is
not
an
objection
that
can
be
brought
against
modern
geometry
as
a
whole
in
regard
to
any
particular
parts
of
it
which
may
appear
open
to
such
an
objection
the
question
is
whether
they
are
or
are
not
for
their
own
sakes
or
their
bearing
upon
other
parts
of
the
science
to
which
they
belong
worthy
of
being
entered
upon
and
pursued
but
admitting
as
i
do
not
that
pure
mathematics
are
only
to
be
studied
with
a
view
to
natural
and
physical
science
the
question
still
arises
how
are
they
best
to
be
studied
in
that
view
i
assume
and
admit
that
as
to
a
large
part
of
modern
geometry
and
of
the
theory
of
numbers
there
is
no
present
probability
that
these
will
find
any
physical
applications
but
among
the
remaining
parts
of
pure
mathematics
we
have
the
theory
of
elliptic
functions
and
of
the
jacobian
and
abelian
functions
and
the
theory
of
differential
equations
including
of
course
partial
differential
equations
now
taking
for
instance
the
problem
of
three
bodies
unless
this
is
to
be
gone
on
with
by
the
mere
improvement
in
detail
of
the
present
approximate
methods
it
is
at
least
conceivable
that
the
future
treatment
of
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
the
problem
of
two
fixed
centres
by
means
of
elliptic
functions
and
that
the
discovery
will
be
made
not
by
searching
for
it
directly
with
the
mathematical
resources
now
at
our
command
but
by
prospecting
for
it
in
the
field
of
these
functions
even
improvements
in
the
existing
methods
are
more
likely
to
arise
from
a
study
of
differential
equations
in
general
than
from
a
special
one
of
the
equations
of
the
particular
problem
the
materials
for
such
improvements
which
exist
in
the
writings
of
hamilton
jacobi
bertrand
and
bour
have
certainly
so
arisen
and
the
like
remarks
would
apply
to
the
physical
problems
which
depend
on
partial
differential
equations
i
think
that
the
course
of
mathematical
study
at
the
university
is
likely
to
be
a
better
one
if
regulated
with
a
view
to
the
cultivation
of
science
as
if
for
its
own
sake
rather
than
directly
upon
considerations
of
what
is
educationally
best
i
mean
that
the
best
educational
course
will
be
so
obtained
and
that
we
have
thus
a
justification
for
a
thorough
study
of
pure
mathematics
in
my
own
limited
experience
of
examinations
the
fault
which
i
find
with
the
men
is
a
want
of
analytical
power
and
that
whatever
else
may
have
been
in
defect
pure
mathematics
has
certainly
not
been
in
excess
i
remain
dear
sir
yours
sincerely
cayley
cambridge
december
my
dear
sir
since
receiving
your
letter
of
i
positively
have
not
had
time
to
express
the
single
remark
which
i
proposed
to
make
on
it
you
state
your
idea
that
the
educational
element
ought
not
to
be
the
predominating
element
in
the
university
i
do
not
think
that
every
thing
should
be
subordinated
to
the
educational
element
i
can
not
conceal
my
surprise
at
this
sentiment
assuredly
the
founders
of
the
colleges
intended
them
for
education
so
far
as
they
apply
to
persons
in
statu
pupillari
the
statutes
of
the
university
and
the
colleges
are
framed
for
education
and
fathers
send
their
sons
to
the
university
for
education
if
i
had
not
had
your
words
before
me
i
should
have
said
that
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
this
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
professors
and
others
who
exercise
no
control
by
force
should
take
every
method
not
only
of
promoting
science
in
themselves
but
also
of
placing
the
promoted
science
before
students
and
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
students
who
have
passed
the
compulsory
curriculum
should
be
encouraged
to
proceed
into
the
novelties
which
will
be
most
agreeable
to
them
but
this
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
using
the
compulsory
force
of
examination
to
drive
students
in
paths
traced
only
by
the
taste
of
the
examiner
for
them
i
conceive
the
obligation
to
the
nation
and
the
duty
to
follow
the
national
sense
on
education
as
far
as
it
can
be
gathered
from
its
best
representatives
to
be
undoubted
and
to
be
in
the
intensity
of
the
obligation
and
duty
most
serious
i
am
my
dear
sir
yours
very
truly
airy
in
the
dome
the
alteration
proposed
last
year
for
rendering
the
building
had
been
completely
carried
out
the
middle
room
which
was
to
be
appropriated
to
chronometers
was
being
fitted
up
from
the
report
it
appears
that
subterranean
telegraph
wires
were
all
broken
by
one
blow
from
an
accident
in
the
metropolitan
drainage
works
on
groom
hill
but
were
speedily
repaired
in
my
office
as
chairman
of
successive
commissions
on
standards
i
had
collected
a
number
of
standards
some
of
great
historical
value
as
ramsden
and
roy
standards
of
length
kater
for
weighing
great
weights
and
others
these
have
been
transferred
to

department
of
the
board
of

in
the
report
is
given
a
detailed
account
of
the
system
of
preserving
and
arranging
the
manuscripts
and
correspondence
of
the
observatory
which
was
always
regarded
by
airy
as
a
matter
of
the
first
from
a
careful
discussion
of
the
results
of
observation
mr
stone
had
concluded
that
the
refractions
ought
to
be
diminished
on
this
we
have
now
computed
our
mean
refractions
by
diminishing
those
of
bessel
fundamenta
in
the
proportion
of
to
the
for
the
period
had
been
reduced
and
discussed
with
remarkable
results
it
is
inferred
that
magnetic
disturbances
both
solar
and
lunar
are
produced
mediately
by
the
earth
and
that
the
earth
in
periods
of
several
years
undergoes
changes
which
fit
it
and
unfit
it
for
exercising
a
powerful
mediate
the
records
had
been
reduced
and
the
magnetic
effect
which
the
currents
would
produce
had
been
computed
the
result
was
that
the
agreement
between
the
magnetic
effects
so
computed
and
the
magnetic
disturbances
really
recorded
by
the
magnetometers
was
such
as
to
leave
no
doubt
on
the
general
validity
of
the
explanation
of
the
great
of
the
magnets
as
consequences
of
the
galvanic
currents
through
the
referring
to
the
difficulty
experienced
in
making
the
meteorological
observations
practically
available
the
report
states
thus
want
of
meteorology
at
the
present
time
is
principally
in
suggestive
theory
in
this
year
airy
communicated
to
the
royal
astronomical
society
a
paper
the
preparatory
arrangements
for
the
observation
of
the
transits
of
venus
and
this
subject
was
now
well
in
the
first
report
of
the
commissioners
of
whom
he
was
chairman
appointed
to
enquire
into
the
condition
of
the
exchequer
standards
was
printed
this
business
took
up
much
he
was
in
this
year
much
engaged
on
the
coinage
commission
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
winter
visit
to
playford
and
a
short
visit
to
cambridge
in
from
about
to
he
was
travelling
in
switzerland
with
his
youngest
son
and
his
two
youngest
daughters
in
the
course
of
this
journey
they
visited
zermatt
there
had
been
much
rain
the
rivers
were
greatly
flooded
and
much
mischief
was
done
to
the
roads
during
the
journey
from
visp
to
zermatt
near
st
nicholas
in
a
steep
part
of
the
gorge

large
stone
rolled
from
the
cliffs
and
knocked
their
baggage
horse
over
the
lower
precipice
a
fall
of
several
hundred
feet
the
packages
were
all
burst
and
many
things
were
lost
but
a
good
deal
was
recovered
by
men
suspended
by
ropes
in
this
year
also
airy
was
busy
with
the
subject
of
university
examination
which
in
previous
years
had
occupied
so
much
of
his
attention
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
letters

my
dear

i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
corresponding
with
you
on
matters
of
university
examination
so
frequently
that
i
at
once
turn
to
you
as
the
proper
person
to
whom
i
may
address
any
remarks
on
that
important
subject
circumstances
have
enabled
me
lately
to
obtain
private
information
of
a
most
accurate
kind
on
the
late
mathematical
tripos
and
among
other
things
i
have
received
a
statement
of
every
individual
question
answered
or
partly
answered
by
five
i
have
collected
the
numbers
of
these
in
a
small
table
which
i
enclose
i
am
struck
with
the
nugatory
character
of
the
five
honour
examination
as
applied
to
senior
optimes
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
is
nugatory
as
applied
to
junior
optimes
it
appears
to
me
that
for
all
that
depends
on
these
days
the
rank
of
the
optimes
is
mere
matter
of
chance
in
the
examinations
of
the
civil
service
the
whole
number
of
marks
is
published
and
also
the
number
of
marks
gained
by
each
candidate
i
have
none
of
their
papers
at
hand
but
my
impression
is
that
the
lowest
candidates
make
about
in
and
the
fair
candidates
about
in
instead
of
in
or
in
as
our
good

my

i
am
much
obliged
by
your
letter

enclosed

anything
done
in
the
last
five
days
by
a
junior
optime
only
shews
generally
that
he
has
been
employing
some
of
his
time
for
he
must
have
been
working
at
subjects
which
he
is
quite
unable
to
master
or
cramming
them
by
heart
on
the
chance
of
meeting
with
a
stray
question
which
he
may
answer
the
chief
part
of
the
senior
optimes
are
in
something
of
the
same
situation
i
think
that
the
proposed
addition
of
a
day
to
the
first
part
of
the
examination
in
which
easy
questions
in
physical
subjects
may
be
set
is
on
this
account
a
great
improvement
our
new
scheme
comes
on
for
discussion
on
friday
next
march
at

school
it
is
much
opposed
by
private
tutors
examiners
and
others
and
may
possibly
be
thrown
out
in
the
senate
this
year
though
i
hope
that
with
a
little
patience
it
may
be
carried
in
an
unmutilated
form
eventually
the
enclosed
report
on
the
smith
prize
examination
will
be
discussed
at
the

time
i
will
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done

the

to
which
your
note
refers
without
delay
with
many
thanks

in
this
year
certain
members
of
the
senate
of
the
university
of
cambridge
petitioned
parliament
against
the
abolition
of
religious
declarations
required
of
persons
admitted
to
fellowships
or
proceeding
to
the
degree
of
the
document
was
sent
to
airy
for
his
signature
and
his
reply
was
as
follows
royal
observatory
greenwich
london
march
my
dear
sir
though
i
sympathize
to
a
great
extent
with
the
prayer
of
the
petition
to
parliament
which
you
sent
to
me
yesterday
and
assent
to
most
of
the
reasons
i
do
not
attach
my
signature
to
it
for
the
following
considerations
i
understand
from
the
introductory
clause
and
from
the
unqualified
character
of
the
phrase
any
such
measures
in
the
second
clause
that
the
petition
objects
to
granting
the
degree
without
religious
declaration
i
do
not
see
any
adequate
necessity
for
this
objection
and
i
can
not
join
in
it
it
appears
to
me
that
the
colleges
were
intended
for
two
collateral
objects
instruction
by
part
of
the
fellows
on
a
religious
basis
and
support
of
certain
fellows
for
scientific
purposes
without
the
same
ostentatious
connection
with
religion
i
like
this
spirit
well
and
should
be
glad
to
maintain
it
i
therefore
think
as
i
have
publicly
stated
before
that
the
master
of
the
college
ought
to
be
in
holy
orders
and
so
ought
those
of
the
fellows
who
may
be
expected
to
be
usually
resident
and
to
take
continuous
part
in
the
instruction
but
there
are
many
who
upon
taking
a
fellowship
at
once
lay
aside
all
thoughts
of
this
and
i
think
that
such
persons
ought
not
to
be
trammelled
with
declarations
my
modification
of
existing
regulations
if
it
once
got
into
shape
would
i
dare
say
be
but
a
small
fraction
of
that
proposed
by
the
measures
in
contemplation
still
i
do
not
like
to
join
in
unqualified
resistance
to
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
established
colleges
with
that
generality
of
opposition
to
interference
which
the
petition
seems
to
intimate
i
agree
with
articles
and
and
i
am
pleased
with
the
graceful
allusion
in
article
to
the
assistance
which
has
been
rendered
by
the
colleges
and
by
none
perhaps
so
honourably
as
trinity
to
the
parishes
connected
with
it
and
i
could
much
wish
that
the
spirit
of
and
could
be
carried
out
with
some
concession
to
my
ideas
in
paragraph
above
i
am
my

very
truly
airy

from
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
it
appears
that
application
had
been
made
for
an
extension
of
the
grounds
of
the
observatory
to
a
distance
of
feet
south
of
the
magnetic
ground
and
that
a
warrant
for
the
annexation
of
this
space
was
signed
on
the
new
depôt
for
the
printed
productions
of
the
observatory
had
been
transferred
to
its
position
in
the
new
ground
and
the
foundations
for
the
great
shed
were
the
courses
of
our
wires
for
the
registration
of
spontaneous
terrestrial
galvanic
currents
have
been
entirely
changed
the
lines
to
croydon
and
deptford
are
abandoned
and
for
these
are
substituted
a
line
from
angerstein
wharf
to
lady
well
station
and
a
line
from
north
kent
junction
to
morden
college
tunnel
at
each
of
these
points
the
communication
with
earth
is
made
by
a
copper
plate
feet
square
the
straight
line
connecting
the
extreme
points
of
the
first
station
intersects
that
connecting
the
two
points
of
the
second
station
nearly
at
right
angles
and
at
little
distance
from
the
the
question
of
dependence
of
the
measurable
amount
of
sidereal
aberration
upon
the
thickness
of
glass
or
other
transparent
material
in
the
telescope
a
question
which
involves
theoretically
one
of
the
most
delicate
points
in
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
has
lately
been
agitated
on
the
continent
with
much
earnestness
i
have
calculated
the
curvatures
of
the
lenses
of
crown
and
flint
glass
the
flint
being
exterior
for
correcting
spherical
and
chromatic
aberration
in
a
telescope
whose
tube
is
filled
with
water
and
have
instructed
mr
simms
to
proceed
with
the
preparation
of
an
instrument
carrying
such
a
telescope
i
have
not
finally
decided
whether
to
rely
on
of
gamma
draconis
or
on
of
polaris
in
any
form
the
experiment
will
probably
be
the
transit
of
mercury
on
was
observed
by
six
observers
the
atmospheric
conditions
were
favourable
and
the
singular
appearances
usually
presented
in
a
planetary
transit
were
well
mr
stone
has
attached
to
the
equatoreal
a
with
the
view
of
examining
whether
heat
radiating
from
the
principal
stars
can
be
made
sensible
in
our
instruments
the
results
hitherto
obtained
are
encouraging
but
they
shew
clearly
that
it
is
vain
to
attempt
this
enquiry
except
in
the
most
superb
weather
and
there
has
not
been
a
night
deserving
that
epithet
for
some
months
the
preparations
for
observing
the
transits
of
venus
were
now
begun
in
earnest
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
after
every
reliance
was
placed
on
foreign
and
colonial
observatories
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
british
government
to
undertake
the
equipment
of
five
or
six
temporary
stations
on
i
sent
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
to
mr
childers
first
lord
of
admiralty
and
in
april
i
wrote
to
the
secretary
asking
authority
for
the
purchase
of
instruments
on
june
authority
is
given
to
me
for
the
instruments
the
treasury
assent
to
on
august
i
had
purchased
i
have
given
a
short
course
of
lectures
in
the
university
of
cambridge
on
the
subject
of
magnetism
with
the
view
of
introducing
that
important
physical
science
into
the
studies
of
the
university
the
want
of
books
available
to
students
and
the
novelty
of
the
subject
made
the
preparation
more
laborious
than
the
duration
of
the
lectures
would
seem
to
imply
in
this
year
there
was
much
work
on
the
standards
commission
chiefly
regarding
the
suggested
abolition
of
troy
weight
and
several
papers
on
the
subject
were
prepared
by
he
also
wrote
a
long
and
careful
description
of
the
great
equatoreal
at
greenwich
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
visit
to
playford
in
the
winter
mrs
airy
was
now
becoming
feebler
and
did
not
now
leave
greenwich
since
april
of
this
year
her
letters
were
written
in
pencil
and
with
difficulty
but
she
still
made
great
efforts
to
keep
up
the
accustomed
in
april
airy
went
to
cambridge
to
deliver
his
lectures
on
magnetism
to
the
undergraduates
the
following
passage
occurs
in
one
of
his
letters
at
this
time
i
have
a
mighty
attendance
there
were
names
on
my
board
yesterday
and
though
the
room
is
large
with
plenty
of
benches
i
have
been
obliged
to
bring
in
some
chairs
the
men
are
exceedingly
attentive
and
when
i
look
up
i
am
quite
struck
to
see
the
number
of
faces
staring
into
mine
i
go
at
and
find
men
at
the
room
copying
from
my
big
papers
i
lecture
from
to
and
stop
till
after
and
through
the
last
hour
some
men
are
talking
to
me
and
others
are
copying
from
the
papers
and
i
usually
leave
some
men
still
at
work
the
men
applaud
and
shew
their
respect
very
gracefully
there
are
present
some
two
or
three
persons
who
attended
my
former
lectures
and
they
say
that
i
lecture
exactly
as
i
did
formerly
one
of
my
attendants
is
a
man
that
they
say
can
not
from
years
and
infirmity
and
habit
be
induced
to
go
anywhere
else
dr
archdall
the
master
of
emmanuel
i
find
that
some
of
my
old
lecturing
habits
come
again
on
me
i
drink
a
great
deal
of
cold
water
and
am
very
glad
to
go

was
travelling
in
scotland
and
staying
at

mr
langton
with
his

subsequently
from

was
again
in
the
lake

with
his
daughter
christabel
and
was
joined
there
by
his
son
hubert

the
first
part
of

spent
at
tarn
bank
near
carlisle
the
residence
of
mr
isaac
fletcher
from
thence
he
made
several
expeditions
especially
to
barrow
in
furness
and
seascale
where
he
witnessed
with
great
interest
the
bessemer
process
of
making
steel
from
barrow

he
made
continual
excursions
among
the
cumberland
mountains
which
he
knew
so
well
in
this
year
mr

appointed
to

his
from
the
report
to
the
visitors
it
appears
that
few
months
since
we
were
annoyed
by
a
failure
in
the
illumination
of
the
field
of
view
of
the
transit
circle
the
reflector
was
cleaned
but
in
vain
at
last
it
was
discovered
that
one
of
the
lenses
the
convex
lens
of
the
combination
which
forms
the
of
a
reversed
telescope
in
the
interior
of
the
and
through
which
all
illuminating
light
must
pass
had
become
so
corroded
as
to
be
almost
opaque
the
equatoreal
has
been
partly
occupied
with
the
employed
by
mr
stone
for
the
measure
of
heat
radiating
from
the
principal
stars
mr
stone
results
for
the
radiation
from
arcturus
and
alpha
lyrae
appear
to
be
incontrovertible
and
to
give
bases
for
distinct
numerical
estimation
of
the
radiant
heat
of
these
in
my
last
report
i
alluded
to
a
proposed
systematic
reduction
of
the
meteorological
observations
during
the
whole
time
of
their
efficient
having
received
from
the
admiralty
the
funds
necessary
for
immediate
operations
i
have
commenced
with
the
photographic
registers
of
the
thermometers
and
from
to
our
contains
at
present
chronometers
including
chronometers
which
have
been
placed
here
by
as
competing
for
the
honorary
reputation
and
the
pecuniary
advantages
to
be
derived
from
success
in
the
trial
to
which
they
are
subjected
i
take
this
opportunity
of
stating
that
i
have
uniformly
advocated
the
policy
of
offering
good
prices
for
the
chronometers
of
great
excellence
and
that
i
have
given
much
attention
to
the
decision
on
their
merits
and
i
am
convinced
that
this
system
has
greatly
contributed
to
the
remarkably
steady
improvement
in
the
performance
of
chronometers
in
the
trial
which
terminated
in
august
the
best
chronometers
taking
as
usual
the
average
of
the
first
six
were
superior
in
merit
to
those
of
any
preceding
with
the
funds
placed
at
my
disposal
for
the
transit
of
venus
i
purchased
three
equatoreals
and
have
ordered
two
i
have
also
ordered
altazimuths
with
accurate
vertical
circles
only
and
clocks
sufficient
as
i
expect
to
equip
five
stations
for
methods
of
observation
i
rely
generally
on
the
simple
possibly
relieved
of
some
of
its
uncertainty
by
the
use
of
my
eyepiece
but
active
discussion
has
taken
place
on
the
feasibility
of
using
photographic
and
spectroscopic
methods
and
it
will
not
be
easy
for
some
time
to
announce
that
the
plan
of
observations
is
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
imagine
that
the
first
and
necessary
duty
of
the
royal
observatory
is
to
maintain
its
place
well
as
an
observing
establishment
and
that
this
must
be
secured
at
whatever
sacrifice
if
necessary
of
other
pursuits
still
the
question
has
not
unfrequently
presented
itself
to
me
whether
the
duties
to
which
i
allude
have
not
by
force
of
circumstances
become
too
exclusive
and
whether
the
cause
of
science
might
not
gain
if
as
in
the
imperial
observatory
of
paris
for
instance
the
higher
branches
of
mathematical
physics
should
not
take
their
place
by
the
side
of
observatory
routine
i
have
often
felt
the
desire
practically
to
refresh
my
acquaintance
with
what
were
once
favourite
subjects
lunar
theory
and
physical
optics
but
i
do
not
at
present
clearly
see
how
i
can
enter
upon
them
with
that
degree
of
freedom
of
thought
which
is
necessary
for
success
in
abstruse
investigations
of
private
history
there
was
a
longer
visit
than
usual
to
playford
lasting
till
jan
in
april
he
made
a
short
excursion
of
less
than
a
week
with
his
son
hubert
to
monmouth
from
june
to
july
he
was
staying
at
barrow
house
near
keswick
with
his
son
hubert
during
this
time
he
was
much
troubled
with
a
painful
of
his
leg
and
back
which
lasted
in
some
degree
for
a
long
time
from
to
he
made
an
excursion
with
his
daughter
christabel
to
scarborough
whitby
and
again
spent
a
few
days
at
barrow
house
in
april
the
assistants
had
applied
for
an
increase
of
salary
a
request
which
i
had
urged
strongly
upon
the
admiralty
on
of
this
year
the
admiralty
answered
that
on
account
of
mr
illness
the
consideration
must
be
deferred
to
next
year
the
assistants
wrote
bitterly
to
me
and
with
my
sanction
they
wrote
to
the
first
lord
on
i
requested
an
interview
with
mr
baxter
secretary
of
the
admiralty
and
saw
him
on
when
i
obtained
his
consent
to
an
addition
of
there
was
still
a
difficulty
with
the
treasury
but
on
june
the
liberal
scale
was
experiments
made
by
mr
stone
shew
clearly
that
a
local
elevation
like
that
of
the
royal
observatory
on
the
hill
of
greenwich
park
has
no
tendency
to
diminish
the
effect
of
railway
the
correction
for
level
error
in
the
transit
circle
having
become
inconveniently
large
a
sheet
of
very
thin
paper
inch
in
thickness
was
placed
under
the
eastern

which
was
raised
from
its
bed
for
the
purpose
the
mean
annual
value
of
the
appears
to
be
now
sensibly
as
the
siege
and
war
operations
in
paris
seriously
interfered
with
the
observations
of
small
planets
made
at
the
paris
observatory
observations
of
them
were
continued
at
greenwich
throughout
each
entire
lunation
during
the
investment
of
the
the
new
has
been
got
into
working
order
and
performs
most
satisfactorily
observations
of
gamma
draconis
have
been
made
with
it
when
the
star
passed
between
and
with
some
observations
for
adjustment
at
a
still
more
advanced
time
as
the
astronomical
latitude
of
the
place
of
observation
is
not
known
the
bearing
of
these
observations
on
the
question
of
aberration
can
not
be
certainly
pronounced
until
the
autumn
observations
shall
have
been
made
but
supposing
the
geodetic
latitude
to
be
accordant
with
the
astronomical
latitude
the
result
for
aberration
appears
to
be
sensibly
the
same
as
with
ordinary
several
years
since
i
prepared
a
barometer
by
which
the
barometric
fluctuations
were
enlarged
for
the
information
of
the
public
its
indications
are
exhibited
on
the
wall
near
to
the
entrance
gate
of
the
observatory
a
card
is
now
also
exhibited
in
a
glass
case
near
the
public
barometer
giving
the
highest
and
lowest
readings
of
the
thermometer
in
the
preceding
those
who
have
given
attention
to
the
history
of
terrestrial
magnetism
are
aware
that
halley
magnetic
chart
is
very
frequently
cited
but
i
could
not
learn
that
any
person
at
least
in
modern
times
had
seen
it
at
last
i
discovered
a
copy
in
the
library
of
the
british
museum
and
have
been
allowed
to
take
copies
by
photolithography
these
are
appended
to
the
magnetical
and
meteorological
volume
for
the
trials
and
certificates
of
for
the
use
of
the
royal
navy
have
lately
been
so
frequent
that
they
almost
become
a
regular
part
of
the
work
of
the
observatory
i
may
state
here
that
by
availing
myself
of
a
theory
of
eyepieces
which
i
published
long
since
in
the
cambridge
transactions
i
have
been
able
to
effect
a
considerable
improvement
in
the
telescopes
furnished
to
the
the
occurrence
of
the
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
in
december
last
has
brought
much
labour
upon
the
observatory
as
regards
the
assistants
and
computers
the
actual
observation
on
a
complicated
plan
with
the
great
equatoreal
a
plan
for
which
few
equatoreals
are
sufficiently
steady
but
which
when
properly
carried
out
gives
a
most
complete
solution
of
the
geometrical
problem
has
required
in
observation
and
in
computation
a
large
expenditure
of
my
preparations
for
the
transit
of
venus
have
respect
only
to
of
contact
of
limbs
with
all
the
liabilities
and
defects
to
which
it
is
subject
this
method
possesses
the
inestimable
advantage
of
placing
no
reliance
on
instrumental
scales
i
hope
that
the
error
of
observation
may
not
exceed
four
seconds
of
time
corresponding
to
about
of
arc
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
in
a
detailed
form
a
plan
for
making
the
proper
measures
by
heliometric
or
photographic
apparatus
and
should
take
great
interest
in
combining
these
with
the
if
my
selected
stations
can
be
made
available
but
my
present
impression
is
one
of
doubt
on
the
certainty
of
equality
of
parts
in
the
scale
employed
an
error
depending
on
this
cause
could
not
be
diminished
by
any
repetition
of
observations
after
referring
to
the
desirability
of
vigorously
prosecuting
the
meteorological
reductions
already
begun
and
of
discussing
the
magnetic
observations
the
report
concludes
thus
there
is
another
consideration
which
very
often
presents
itself
to
my
mind
the
waste
of
labour
in
the
repetition
of
observations
at
different
observatories
i
think
that
this
consideration
ought
not
to
be
put
out
of
sight
in
planning
the
courses
of
different
observatories
in
this
year
de
launay
lunar
theory
was
published
this
valuable
work
was
of
great
service
to
airy
in
the
preparation
of
the
numerical
lunar
theory
which
he
subsequently
in
the
latter
part
of
this
year
airy
was
elected
president
of
the
royal
society
and
held
the
office
during
and
at
this
time
he
was
much
pressed
with
work
and
could
ill
afford
to
take
up
additional
duties
as
the
following
quotation
from
a
letter
to
one
of
his
friends
shews
the
election
to
the
presidency
of
is
flattering
and
has
brought
to
me
the
friendly
remembrances
of
many
persons
but
in
its
material
and
laborious
connections
i
could
well
have
dispensed
with
it
and
should
have
done
so
but
for
the
respectful
way
in
which
it
was
pressed
on
me
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
winter
visit
to
in
april
he
made
a
short
trip
to
cornwall
with
his
daughter
in
june
he
was
appointed
a
companion
of
the
bath
and
was
presented
at
court
on
his
mrs
airy
was
staying
with
her
daughter
mrs
routh
at
hunstanton
during
june
her
state
of
health
being
somewhat
from
august
to
he
was
chiefly
in
cumberland
at
barrow
house
and
at
grange
borrowdale
where
his
son
osmund
was
staying
for
a
holiday
from
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
it
appears
that
normal
siderial
clock
for
giving
sidereal
time
by
galvanic
communication
to
the
astronomical
observatory
was
established
in
the
magnetic
basement
in
june
that
locality
being
adapted
for
it
on
account
of
the
uniformity
of
temperature
the
daily
changed
of
temperature
rarely
exceeding
fahrenheit
its
escapement
is
one
which
i
suggested
many
years
ago
in
the
cambridge
transactions
a
detached
escapement
very
closely
analogous
to
the
ordinary
chronometer
escapement
the
pendulum
receiving
an
impulse
only
at
alternate
vibrations
the
steadiness
of
rate
is
very
far
superior
to
any
that
we
have
previously
attained
the
aspect
of
railway
enterprise
is
at
present
favourable
to
the
park
and
to
the
observatory
the
railway
company
has
made
an
arrangement
with
the
metropolitan
board
of
works
for
shifting
the
course
of
the
great
southern
outfall
sewer
this
enables
the
company
to
trace
a
new
line
for
the
railway
passing
on
the
north
side
of
london
street
at
such
a
distance
from
the
observatory
as
to
remove
all
cause
of
alarm
i
understand
that
the
bill
which
was
unopposed
has
passed
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
i
trust
that
the
contest
which
has
lasted
years
is
now
the
observations
of
draconis
with
the
made
in
the
autumn
of
and
the
spring
of
are
reduced
the
latter
only
in
their
first
steps
using
the
values
of
the
level
scales
as
determined
by
mr
simms
which
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
to
be
inaccurate
the
spring
and
autumn
observations
of
absolutely
negative
the
idea
of
any
effect
being
produced
on
the
constant
of
aberration
by
the
amount
of
refracting
medium
traversed
by
the
the
great
aurora
of
was
well
observed
on
this
occasion
the
term
borealis
would
have
been
a
misnomer
for
the
phenomenon
began
in
the
south
and
was
most
conspicuous
in
the
south
three
times
in
the
evening
it
exhibited
that
appearance
which
has
been
called
perhaps
inaccurately
a
corona
i
have
very
carefully
compared
its
momentary
phenomena
with
the
corresponding
movements
of
the
magnetometers
in
some
of
the
most
critical
times
the
comparison
fails
on
account
of
the
violent
movements
and
consequent
faint
traces
of
the
magnetometers
i
have
not
been
able
to
connect
the
phases
of
aurora
and
those
of
magnetic
disturbance
very
the
report
contains
a
detailed
account
of
the
heavy
preparations
for
the
observation
of
the
transit
of
venus
including
the
portable
buildings
for
the
instruments
the
instruments
themselves
being
a
an
altazimuth
and
an
equatoreal
for
each
station
and
first
class
and
clocks
all
sufficient
for
the
equipment
of
stations
and
continues
thus
i
was
made
aware
of
the
assent
of
the
government
to
the
wish
of
the
board
of
visitors
as
expressed
at
their
last
meeting
that
provision
should
be
made
for
the
application
of
photography
to
the
observation
of
the
transit
of
venus
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
remark
that
our
hope
of
success
is
founded
entirely
on
our
confidence
in
mr
de
la
rue
under
his
direction
mr
dallmeyer
has
advanced
far
in
the
preparation
of
five
photoheliographs
the
subject
is
recognized
by
many
astronomers
as
not
wholly
free
from
difficulties
but
it
is
generally
believed
that
these
difficulties
may
be
overcome
and
mr
de
la
rue
is
giving
careful
attention
to
the
most
important
of
i
take
this
opportunity
of
reporting
to
the
board
that
the
observatory
was
honoured
by
a
visit
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
brazil
who
minutely
examined
every
part
after
referring
to
various
subjects
which
in
his
opinion
might
be
usefully
pursued
systematically
at
the
observatory
the
report
proceeds
thus
character
of
the
observatory
would
be
somewhat
changed
by
this
innovation
but
not
as
i
imagine
in
a
direction
to
which
any
objection
can
be
made
it
would
become
pro
tanto
a
physical
observatory
and
possibly
in
time
its
operations
might
be
extended
still
further
in
a
physical
direction
the
consideration
of
possible
changes
in
the
future
of
the
observatory
leads
me
to
the
recollection
of
actual
changes
in
the
past
in
my
annual
reports
to
the
visitors
i
have
endeavoured
to
chronicle
these
but
still
there
will
be
many
circumstances
which
at
present
are
known
only
to
myself
but
which
ought
not
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
history
i
have
therefore
lately
employed
some
time
in
drawing
up
a
series
of
skeleton
annals
of
the
observatory
which
unavoidably
partakes
in
some
measure
of
the
form
of
biography
and
have
carried
it
through
the
critical
period
if
i
should
command
sufficient
leisure
to
bring
it
down
to
i
think
that
i
might
then
very
well
stop
the
skeleton
annals
here
referred
to
are
undoubtedly
the
manuscript
notes
which
form
the
basis
of
the
present
biography
ed
on
in
this
year
i
first
privately
formed
the
notion
of
preparing
a
numerical
lunar
theory
by
substituting
delaunay
numbers
in
the
proper
equations
and
seeing
what
would
come
of
it
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
visit
to
playford
in
this
year
later
than
usual
from
to
mar
the
letters
written
during
this
visit
are
as
usual
full
of
freshness
and
delight
at
finding
himself
in
his
favourite
country
on
june
he
went
to
barrow
house
near
keswick
to
be
present
at
the
marriage
of
his
second
son
hubert
to
miss
langton
daughter
of
langton
of
barrow
after
the
wedding
he
made
a
trip
through
the
trossachs
district
of
scotland
with
his
daughter
annot
and
returned
to
greenwich
on
june
on
the
june
airy
was
appointed
a
knight
commander
of
the
most
honourable
order
of
the
bath
he
was
knighted
by
the
queen
at
osborne
on
the
of
july
in
the
course
of
his
official
career
he
had
three
times
been
offered
knighthood
and
had
each
time
declined
it
but
it
seemed
now
as
if
his
scruples
on
the
subject
were
removed
and
it
is
probable
that
he
felt
gratified
by
the
public
recognition
of
his
services
of
course
the
occasion
produced
many
letters
of
congratulation
from
his
friends
to
one
of
these
he
replied
as
follows
the
real
charm
of
these
public
compliments
seems
to
be
that
they
excite
the
sympathies
and
elicit
the
kind
expressions
of
private
friends
or
of
official
superiors
as
well
as
subordinates
in
every
way
i
have
derived
pleasure
from
these
from
the
assistants
of
the
royal
observatory
he
received
a
hearty
letter
of
congratulation
containing
the
following
paragraph
our
position
has
naturally
given
us
peculiar
opportunities
for
perceiving
the
high
and
broad

and
of

unless
by
the
flattering
interpretation
of
my

partly
by
personal

partly
by

in
every
instance
by
reputation
i
have
known
so
long
i
beg
that
you
will
convey
to
the

my
esteem
for
that

in
its

my
deep

that
on
considering
the
attention
which
the
royal

had
been
able
to
offer
to
your

as
well
as
the
explanation
of
the
various
parts
of
the
establishment
of
this

which
i
had
the
honor
and
the
high
gratification
to
communicate
you

your

been
pleased
to
advert
to
the
approaching
transit
of
venus
on
the
preparations
for
which
you
found
me
engaged
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
transit
of

not
be
visible
at
rio

for
that
of
rio
will
be
a
favourable
position
and
we
reckon
on
the
observations
to
be
made
there
your

may
be
assured
that
i
shall
loyally
bear
in
mind
your
desire

be
informed
of
any
remarkable

of
this

faithful

the

old

now
very
aged
and
infirm
but
his
spirit
was
still
vigorous
and
he
was
as
ever
the
following
letter
from
him
probably
the
last
of
their
long
correspondence
was
written
in
this

my
dear
airy
i
have
received
your
card
of
invitation
for
the
of
june
and
with
great
joy
should
i
count
upon
that
day
if
i
thought
that
i
should
be
able
to
accept
your
invitation
but
alas
i
have
no
hope
of
the
kind
for
that
humiliating
malady
which
now
has
fastened
upon
me
for
a
full
year
and
a
half
has
not
let
go
its
hold
nor
is
it
likely
to
do
so
a
man
who
is
journeying
in
the
year
of
his
pilgrimage
is
not
likely
to
throw
off
such
a
chronic
malady
indeed
were
i
well
enough
to
come
i
am
deaf
as
a
post
and
half
blind
and
if
i
were
with
you
i
should
only
be
able
to
play
dummy
several
years
have
passed
away
since
i
was
last
at
your
visitation
and
i
had
great
joy
in
seeing
mrs
airy
and
some
lady
friends
at
the
observatory
but
i
could
not
then
attend
the
dinner
at
that
meeting
were
many
faces
that
i
knew
but
strangely
altered
by
the
rude
handling
of
old
time
and
there
were
many
new
faces
which
i
had
never
seen
before
at
a
royal
society
meeting
but
worse
than
all
all
the
old
faces
were
away
in
vain
i
looked
round
for
wollaston
davy
davies
gilbert
barrow
troughton
and
the
merry
companion
admiral
smyth
was
also
away
so
that
my
last
visit
had
its
sorrowful
side
but
why
should
i
bother
you
with
these
old
man
mopings
i
send
an
old
man
blessing
and
an
old
man
love
to
all
the
members
of
your
family
especially
to
mrs
airy
the
oldest
and
dearest
of
my
lady
friends
i
remain
my
dear

your
old

his
adam

shall
i
ever
again
gaze
with
wonder
and
delight
from
the
great
window
of
your

the
body
of

having
been
established
at
the

observatory
mr
hilgard
principal
officer
of
the
american
coast
survey
has
made
use
of
it
for
determining
the
longitude
of
harvard
from
greenwich
through
paris
brest
and
st
pierre
for
this
purpose
mr
hilgard
transit
instrument
was
planted
in
the
magnetic
court
i
understand
that
the
result
does
not
sensibly
differ
from
that
obtained
by
mr
gould
through
valentia
and
it
was
known
to
the
scientific
world
that
several
of
the
original
thermometers
constructed
by
mr
sheepshanks
in
the
course
of
his
preparation
of
the
national
standard
of
length
by
independent
calibration
of
the
bores
and
independent
determination
of
the
freezing
and
boiling
points
on
arbitrary
graduations
were
still
preserved
at
the
royal
observatory
it
was
lately
stated
to
me
by
tresca
the
principal
officer
of
the
international
metrical
commission
that
in
the
late
unhappy
war
in
paris
the
french
original
thermometers
were
destroyed
and
tresca
requested
that
if
possible
some
of
the
original
thermometers
made
by
mr
sheepshanks
might
be
appropriated
to
the
use
of
the
international
commission
i
have
therefore
transferred
to
tresca
the
three
thermometers
with
the
documentary
information
relating
to
them
which
was
found
in
mr
sheepshanks
papers
retaining
six
thermometers
of
the
same
class
in
the
royal
the
sidereal
standard
clock
continues
to
give
great
satisfaction
i
am
considering
with
the
aid
of
mr
buckney
of
the
firm
of
dent
and
an
arrangement
for
barometric
correction
founded
on
the
principle
of
action
on
the
pendulum
by
means
of
a
magnet
which
can
be
raised
or
lowered
by
the
agency
of
a
large
the
altazimuth
has
received
some
important
alterations
an
examination
of
the
results
of
observations
had
made
me
dissatisfied
with
the
bearings
of
the
horizontal
pivots
in
their

mr
simms
at
my
request
changed
the
bearings
in

for
bearing
in
segments
of
circles
a
construction
which
has
worked
admirably
well
in
the
pivots
of
the
transit
circle
and
in
various
other
respects
the
instrument
appears
to
have
received
a
thorough
overhauling

with
the
consent
of
the

society

of

appear
to
entertain
the
conviction
that
the
careful

made
at
this

and
the
orderly
form
of
their

have
contributed
powerfully
to
the
improvement

is
referred
to

as
its
the
arrangements
and
preparations
for
the
observation
of
the
transit
of

occupied
much
attention
with
regard
to
the

it
is
proposed
to
make
trial
of
a
plan
proposed
by
janssen
for
numerous
photographs
of

very
near
to
the
sun

on
apr
the
engaging
of
photographic
teachers
was
sanctioned
observers
were
selected
and
engaged
a
working
model
of
the
transit
was
prepared
and
the
use
of

scale
was
practised
there
was
some
hostile
criticism
of
the
stations
selected
for
the
observation
of
the
transit
which
necessitated
a
formal
reference
is
made
to
the
increase
of
facilities
for
making
magnetical
and
meteorological
observations
the
inevitable
result
of
it
is
that
observations
are
produced
in
numbers
so
great
that
complete
reduction
becomes
almost
impossible
the
labour
of
reduction
is
very
great
and
it
is
concluded
that
of
the
enormous
number
of
meteorological
observations
now
made
at
numerous
observatories
very
few
can
ever
possess
the
smallest

to

but
not
perfectly

entirely
in

consulted
by

be
allowed
for

airy
report
on
this
question
is
dated
apr
it
was
subsequently
much
referred
to

the
official
enquiry
into
the
causes
of

of

resigned
the
presidency
of
the
royal
society
in
his
address
to
the
society
on
he
stated
his
reasons
in
full
as
follows
the
severity
of
official
duties
which
seem
to
increase
while
vigour
to
discharge
them
does
not
increase
and
the
distance
of
my
residence
another
cause
is
a
difficulty
of
hearing
which
unfits
me
for
effective
action
as
chairman
of
council
of
private
history
there
was
the
usual
visit
to
playford
in
january
also
a
short
visit
in

and
a
third
visit
at

was
a
short
run
in
june
of
about
a
week
to
coniston
with
one
of

there
was
a
trip
to
weymouth
for
about
days
with
one
of
his
daughters
in
the
beginning
of
august
on
his
return
from

airy
found
a

peculiar
construction
has
been
made
by
mr

from
my

and
fixed
near
the

shewing
on
a

the
number
of

by
which
it

or
too
fresh
counterpoises
have
been
attached
to
the

the
additional
weight
of
the
new
spectroscope
which
was
finally
received
from
mr
browning
hands
on
may
of
the
present

the
spectroscope
is
specifically
adapted
to
sweeping
round
the
sun
limb
with
a
view
to
mapping
out
the
prominences
and
is
also
available
for
work
on

and
nebulae
the

very
readily
varied

has
been
made
for

been
undertaken
and
completed

of
this

is
as

of

as
depending
on

have
been
computed
and
examined
for
the
whole
period
and
the
exhibition
of
the
results
is
ready
for
press
the
similar
reductions
for
the
thermometer
are
rapidly
approaching
completion
regarding
the
preparations
for
the
transit
of
venus
expeditions
originally
five
stations
were
selected
and
fully
equipped
with
equatoreals
transits
altazimuths
photoheliographs
and
clocks
but
i
have
since
thought
it
desirable
to
supplement
these
by
two
branch
stations
in
the
sandwich
islands
and
one
in
kerguelen
island
and
the
additional
instruments
thus
required
have
been
borrowed
from
various
sources
so
that
there
is
now
an
abundant
supply
of
instrumental
means
there
will
thus
be
available
for
observation
of
the
transit
of
venus
telescopes
nine
of
which
will
be
provided
with
and
five
photoheliographs
and
for
determination
of
local
time
and
latitude
and
longitude
there
will
be
nine
transits
and
six
altazimuths
all
the
observers
have
undergone
a
course
of
training
in
photography
first
under
a
professional
photographer
mr
reynolds
and
subsequently
under
capt
abney
whose
new
process
is
to
be
adopted
at
all
the
british
stations
a
janssen
slide
capable
of
taking
photographs
of
venus
and
the
neighbouring
part
of
the
sun
limb
at
intervals
of
one
second
has
been
made
by
mr
dallmeyer
for
each
of
the
five
photoheliographs
attached
to
the
report
to
the
visitors
is
a
copy
of
the
instructions
to
observers
engaged
in
the
transit
of
venus
expeditions
prepared
with
great
care
and
in
remarkable
in
the
past
spring
i
published
in
the
monthly
notices
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
a
statement
of
the
fundamental
points
in
a
new
treatment
of
the
lunar
theory
by
which
availing
myself
of
all
that
has
been
done
in
the
best
algebraical
investigations
of
that
theory
i
trust
to
be
able
by
numerical
operations
only
to
give
greater
accuracy
to
final
results
considerable
progress
has
been
made
in
the
extensive
numerical
developments
the
work
being
done
at
my
private
expense
entirely
by
a
junior
computer
and
i
hope
at
any
rate
to
put
it
in
such
a
state
that
there
will
be
no
liability
to
its
entire
loss
when
this
was
reported
to
the
board
of
visitors
it
was
resolved
on
the
motion
of
stokes
that
this
work
as
a
public
expense
ought
to
be
borne
by
the
government
and
this
was
forwarded
to
the
admiralty
on
june
i
wrote
to
the
secretary
of
the
admiralty
asking
for
for
the
present
year
which
after
the
usual
enquiries
and
explanations
was
sanctioned
on
aug
of
private
history
there
were
short
visits
to
playford
in
january
june
and
october
but
only
for
a
few
days
in
each
in
march
there
was
a
run
of
two
or
three
days
to
newnham
on
the
severn
to
see
the
bore
on
the
severn
and
to
in
july
he
went
to
newcastle
to
observe
with
mr
newall
great
telescope
but
the
weather
was
unfavourable
he
then
went
on
to
barrow
house
near
keswick
and
spent
a
few
days
there
with
excursions
among
the
on
he
went
with
his
daughter
christabel
to
the
isle
of
arran
and
then
by
glasgow
to
the
trosachs
where
he
made
several
excursions
to
verify
the
localities
mentioned
in
the
lady
of
the
lake
while
in
scotland
he
heard
of
the
death
of
his
brother
the
rev
william
airy
and
travelled
to
keysoe
in
bedfordshire
to
attend
the
funeral
and
returned
to
greenwich
on
in
october
of
this
year
i
wrote
to
the
admiralty
that
i
had
grounds
for
asking
for
an
increase
of
my
salary
because
the
pension
which
had
been
settled
on
my
wife
and
which
i
had
practically
recognized
as
part
of
my
salary
had
been
terminated
by
her
death
so
that
my
salary
now
stood
lower
by
than
that
of
the
director
of
studies
of
the
royal
naval
college
the
admiralty
reply
favourably
and
on
the
treasury
raise
my
salary
to
for
the
service
of
the
clock
movement
of
the
great
equatoreal
a
has
been
established
in
the
highest
part
of
the
the
necessity
for
which
arose
from
the
following
circumstance
the
water
clock
was
supplied
by
a
small
pipe
about
feet
in
length
connected
with
the
observatory
main
which
passes
through
the
park
at
a
distance
of
about
feet
from
any
other
branch
pipe
in
spite
of
this
distance
i
have
seen
that
on
stopping
the
in
the
under
the
turret
the
pressure
in
the
gauge
of
the
water
clock
has
been
instantly
increased
by
more
than
lbs
per
square
inch
the
consequent
derangement
of
the
water
clock
in
its
now
incessant
daily
use
became
intolerable
since
the
independent
supply
was
provided
its
performance
has
been
most
with
the
spectroscope
the
solar
prominences
have
been
mapped
on
days
only
but
the
weather
of
the
past
winter
was
exceptionally
unfavourable
for
this
class
of
observation
after
mapping
the
prominences
as
seen
on
the
c
line
the
other
lines
especially
f
and
b
have
been
regularly
examined
whenever
practicable
great
care
has
been
taken
in
determining
the
position
angle
and
heights
of
the
prominences
in
all
cases
the
spectrum
of
coggia
comet
was
examined
at
every
available
opportunity
last
july
and
compared
directly
with
that
of
carbon
dioxide
the
bands
of
the
two
spectra
being
sensibly
coincident
measures
of
the
displacement
of
lines
in
the
spectra
of
stars
as
compared
with
the
corresponding
lines
in
the
spectra
of
terrestrial
elements
chiefly
hydrogen
have
been
made
but
some
of
these
appear
to
be
affected
by
a
constant
error
depending
on
faulty
adjustment
of
the
photographs
of
the
sun
have
been
taken
with
the
kew
photoheliograph
on
days
and
of
these
have
been
selected
for
preservation
the
moon
jupiter
saturn
and
several
stars
including
the
pleiades
and
some
double
stars
have
been
photographed
with
the
great
equatoreal
with
fairly
satisfactory
results
though
further
practice
is
required
in
this
class
of
i
would
mention
a
supplemental
mechanism
which
i
have
myself
introduced
into
some
chronometers
i
have
long
remarked
that
in
ordinary
good
chronometers
the
freedom
from
irregularities
depending
on
mechanical
causes
is
most
remarkable
but
that
after
all
the
efforts
of
the
most
judicious
makers
there
is
in
nearly
every
case
a
perceptible
defect
of
thermal
compensation
there
is
great
difficulty
in
correcting
the
residual
fault
not
only
because
an
inconceivably
small
movement
of
the
weights
on
the
is
required
but
also
because
it
endangers
the
equilibrium
of
the
balance
the
mechanism
adopted
to
remedy
the
defect
is
described
in
a
paper
in
the
horological
journal
of
july
by
mr
ellis
and
has
received
the
approval
of
some
able
with
respect
to
the
transit
of
venus
expeditions
the
parties
from
egypt
and
rodriguez
are
returned
i
am
in
continual
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
other
parties
i
believe
the
and
the
ordinary
photographs
to
be
quite
successful
i
doubt
the
advantage
of
the
janssen
one
of
the
seems
to
have
failed
and
the
gives
some
trouble
at
three
stations
at
rodriguez
and
three
at
kerguelen
the
observations
appear
to
have
been
most
successful
at
the
sandwich
islands
two
of
the
stations
appear
to
have
been
perfectly
successful
except
that
i
fear
that
the
janssen
has
failed
and
a
rich
series
of
lunar
observations
for
longitude
is
obtained
at
new
zealand
i
grieve
to
say
the
observations
were
totally
lost
entirely
in
consequence
of
bad
weather
there
has
been
little
annoyance
from
the
dreaded
drop
greater
inconvenience
and
doubt
have
been
caused
by
the
unexpected
luminous
ring
round
with
regard
to
the
progress
of
my
proposed
new
lunar
theory
three
computers
are
now
steadily
employed
on
the
work
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
detail
and
mass
of
this
work
are
purely
numerical
every
numerical
coefficient
being
accompanied
with
a
symbolical
correction
whose
value
will
sometimes
depend
on
the
time
but
in
every
case
is
ultimately
to
be
obtained
in
a
numerical
form
of
these
coefficients
extracted
for
convenience
from
delaunay
results
there
are
for
parallax
for
longitude
for
latitude
the
arguments
being
preserved
in
the
usual
form
after
reviewing
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
at
the
observatory
during
the
past
forty
years
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
concludes
thus
i
much
desire
to
see
the
system
of
extended
by
clocks
or
daily
signals
to
various
parts
of
our
great
cities
and
our
dockyards
and
above
all
by
hourly
signals
on
the
start
point
which
i
believe
would
be
the
greatest
of
all
benefits
to
nautical
chronometry
should
any
extension
of
our
scientific
work
ever
be
contemplated
i
would
remark
that
the
observatory
is
not
the
place
for
new
physical
investigations
it
is
well
adapted
for
following
out
any
which
originating
with
private
investigators
have
been
reduced
to
laws
susceptible
of
verification
by
daily
observation
the
national
observatory
will
i
trust
always
remain
on
the
site
where
it
was
first
planted
and
which
early
acquired
the
name
of
hill
there
are
some
inconveniences
in
the
position
arising
principally
from
the
limited
extent
of
the
hill
but
they
are
in
my
opinion
very
far
overbalanced
by
its
advantages
in
a
letter
on
the
subject
of
the
smith
prizes
examination
at
cambridge
which
was
always
a
matter
of
the
greatest
interest
to
him
airy
renewed
his
objections
to
the
preponderance
in
the
papers
of
a
class
of
pure
mathematics
which
he
considered
was
never
likely
under
any
circumstances
to
give
the
slightest
assistance
to
physics
and
as
before
these
remarks
called
forth
a
rejoinder
from
cayley
who
was
responsible
for
many
of
the
questions
of
the
class
referred
in
this
year
airy
completed
his
notes
on
the
earlier
hebrew
scriptures
which
were
shortly
afterwards
published
as
a
book
by
messrs
longmans
green
co
in
his
letter
to
the
publishers
introducing
the
subject
he
says
for
many
years
past
i
have
at
times
put
together
a
few
sentences
explanatory
as
i
conceive
of
the
geographical
and
historical
circumstances
connected
with
the
principal
events
recorded
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
the
view
which
i
take
is
free
but
i
trust
not
irreverent
they
terminate
with
a
brief
review
of
colenso
great
work
the
collection
now
amounts
to
a
small
book
from
the
references
already
given
in
previous
years
to
his
papers
and
correspondence
on
the
geography
of
exodus
his
correspondence
with
colenso
it
will
be
seen
that
he
took
a
great
interest
in
the
early
history
of
the
on
august
airy
celebrated
the
bicentenary
of
the
royal
observatory
by
a
dinner
in
the
octagon
room
which
was
attended
by
the
presidents
of
the
royal
society
and
the
astr
society
and
by
a
large
number
of
scientific
gentlemen
interested
in
in
february
he
was
revising
his
treatise
on
probabilities
of
private
history
up
to

was
at
playford
as
for
about
a
week
in
april
he
was
in
the
isle
of
man
with
his
daughter
in
june
there
was
a
short
trip
to
salisbury
blandford
and
on

started
with
his

holiday
in

on

he
was
recalled
by
a
telegram
with
the
intelligence
that
a
change
for
the
worse
had
come
over
his
wife
health
lady
airy
died
on
august
for
the
last
five
years
of
her
life
she
had
been
very
helpless
from
the
effects
of
a
paralytic
stroke
a
very
sad
ending
to
a
bright
and
happy
life
and
had
been
continually
nursed
throughout
this
time
by
her
two
unmarried
daughters
with
the
greatest
and
devotion
her
husband
had
been
unremitting
in
his
care
and
attention
nothing
was
wanting
that
the
most
thoughtful
kindness
could
supply
and
in
all
his
trips
and
excursions
his
constant
and
kind
letters
shewed
how
anxious
he
was
that
she
should
participate
in
all
his
interests
and
amusements
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
her
death
was
unexpected
and
he
received
the
shock
with
the
manly
steadiness
which
belonged
to
him
lady
airy
was
buried
in
playford
from
to

made
a
short
expedition
to
wales

attended
the
commemoration
at
trinity
college
on

went
as
usual
to

received
the
high
honour
of
the
freedom

a
common
council
holden
in
the
chamber
of
the
guildhall
of

on
thursday
the
day
of

resolved
unanimously
that
the
freedom
of
this
city
in
a
gold
box
of
the
value
of
one
hundred
guineas
be
presented
to
sir
george
biddell
airy
astronomer

as
a
recognition
of
his
indefatigable
labours
in
astronomy
and
of
his
eminent
services
in
the
advancement
of
practical
science
whereby
he
has
so
materially
benefited
the
cause
of
commerce
and
civilization

this
resolution
was
forwarded
with
a
letter
from
benjamin

the
chamberlain
airy
reply
was
as
follows
royal
observatory
greenwich
may
dear
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
acknowledge
your
letter
of
april
accompanied
with
copy
of
the
resolution
of
the
common
council
of
the
city
of
london
passed
at
their
meeting
of
april
under
signature
of
the
town
clerk
that
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
london
in
a
valuable
box
be
presented
to
me
in
recognition
of
works
stated
in
the
resolution
and
i
am
requested
by
you
to
inform
you
whether
it
is
my
intention
to
accept
the
compliment
proposed
by
the
corporation
in
reply
i
beg
you
to
convey
to
the
right
honorable
the
lord
mayor
and
the
corporation
that
i
accept
with
the
greatest
pride
and
pleasure
the
honour
which
they
propose
to
offer
to
me
the
freedom
of
our
great
city
conferred
by
the
spontaneous
act
of
its
municipal
governors
is
in
my
estimation
the
highest
honour
which
it
is
possible
to
receive
and
its
presentation
at
this
time
is
peculiarly
grateful
to
me
i
have
the
honour
to
be
sir
your
very
obedient
servant
airy
scott
chamberlain
of
the
corporation
of
the
city
of
as
it
was
technically
necessary
that
a
freeman
of
the
city
of
london
should
belong
to
one
or
other
of
the
city
companies
the
worshipful
company
of
spectacle
makers
through
their
clerk
with
very
great
appropriateness
enquired
whether
it
would
be
agreeable
that
that
company
should
have
the
privilege
of
conferring
their
honorary
freedom
on
him
and
added
in
soliciting
your
acquiescence
to
the
proposal
i
am
directed
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
guild
is
permitted
to
claim
all
manufacturers
of
mathematical
and
astronomical
instruments
within
the
city
of
london
which
is
now
pleaded
as
an
apology
for
the
wish
that
one
so
distinguished
as
yourself
in
the
use
of
such
instruments
should
be
enrolled
as
a
member
of
this
craft
in
his
reply
accepting
the
freedom
of
the
company
airy
wrote
thus
i
shall
much
value
the
association
with
a
body
whose
ostensible
title
bears
so
close
a
relation
to
the
official
engagements
which
have
long
occupied
me
i
have
had
extensive
experience
both
in
arranging
and
in
using
optical
and
mathematical
instruments
and
feel
that
my
own
pursuits
are
closely
connected
with
the
original
employments
of
the
company
the
freedom
of
the
company
was
duly
presented
and
the
occasion
was
celebrated
by
a
banquet
at
the
albion
tavern
on
tuesday
july
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
london
was
conferred
at
a
court
of
common
council
held
at
the
guildhall
on
thursday
the
of
november
in
presenting
the
gold
box
containing
the
freedom
the
chamberlain
in
an
eloquent
speech
first
referred
to
the
fact
that
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
freedom
had
been
conferred
on
a
person
whose
name
was
associated
with
the
sciences
other
than
those
of
war
and
statecraft
he
then
referred
to
the
solid
character
of
his
work
in
that
while
others
had
turned
their
attention
to
the
more
attractive
fields
of
exploration
the
discovery
of
new
worlds
or
of
novel
celestial
phenomena
he
had
incessantly
devoted
himself
to
the
less
interesting
less
obtrusive
but
more
valuable
walks
of
practical
astronomy
and
he
instanced
as
the
special
grounds
of
the
honour
conferred
the
compilation
of
nautical
tables
of
extraordinary
accuracy
the
improvement
of
chronometers
the
correction
of
the
compasses
of
iron
ships
the
restoration
of
the
standards
of
length
and
weight
and
the
transit
of
venus
expeditions
in
his
reply
airy
stated
that
he
regarded
the
honour
just
conferred
upon
him
as
the
greatest
and
proudest
ever
received
by
him
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
same
honour
had
been
previously
conferred
on
the
valued
friend
of
his
youth
thomas
clarkson
and
said
that
the
circumstance
of
his
succeeding
such
a
man
was
to
himself
a
great
honour
and
pleasure
he
alluded
to
his
having
received
a
small
exhibition
from
one
of
the
london
companies
when
he
was
a
poor
undergraduate
at
cambridge
and
acknowledged
the
great
assistance
that
it
had
been
to
him
with
regard
to
his
occupation
he
said
that
he
had
followed
it
in
a
great
measure
because
of
its
practical
use
and
thought
it
fortunate
that
from
the
first
he
was
connected
with
an
institution
in
which
utility
was
combined
with
science
the
occasion
of
this
presentation
was
celebrated
by
a
banquet
at
the
mansion
house
on
saturday
july
to
sir
george
airy
astronomer
royal
and
the
representatives
of
learned
societies
there
is
no
doubt
that
airy
was
extremely
gratified
by
the
honour
that
he
had
received
it
was
to
him
the
crowning
honour
of
his
life
and
coming
last
of
all
it
threw
all
his
other
honours
into
the
shade
to
his
independent
and
liberal
spirit
there
was
something
peculiarly
touching
in
the
unsolicited
approbation
and
act
of
so
powerful
and
disinterested
a
body
as
the
corporation
of
the
city
of
london
chapter
ix
at
greenwich
observatory
from
january
to
his
resignation
of
office
on
august
at
the
door
from
the
front
court
to
the
staircase
of
the
octagon
room
the
original
entrance
to
the
observatory
as
erected
by
sir
christopher
wren
a
small
has
been
often
desired
i
proposed
to
fix
there
a
of
quadrantal
form
covering
the
upper
flat
stone
of
the
external
on
a
critical
examination
of
the
of
the
transit
circle
it
was
found
that
the
corrections
which
range
from
to
indicate
considerable
wear
in
the
screws
and
it
was
found
that
as
much
as
part
of
an
inch
had
been
worn
away
from
some
of
the
threads
the
old
screws
were
consequently
discarded
and
new
ones
were
made
by
mr
the
adjustment
of
the
spectroscope
has
occupied
a
great
deal
of
attention
there
was
astigmatism
of
the
prisms
and
false
light
reflected
from
the
base
of
the
prisms
causing
loss
both
of
light
and
of
definition
the
latter
defect
was
corrected
by
altering
the
angles
and
then
astigmatism
was
corrected
by
a
cylindrical
lens
near
the
slit
the
definition
in
both
planes
was
then
found
to
be
the
number
of
small
planets
has
now
become
so
great
and
the
interest
of
establishing
the
elements
of
all
their
orbits
so
small
while
at
the
same
time
the
light
of
all
those
lately
discovered
is
very
faint
and
the
difficulty
and
doubt
of
observation
greatly
increased
that
i
have
begun
to
think
seriously
of
limiting
future
observations
to
a
small
number
of
these
all
observations
with
the
spectroscope
have
been
completely
reduced
the
measures
of
lines
in
the
spectra
of
elements
being
converted
into
corresponding
and
the
observations
of
displacement
of
lines
in
the
spectra
of
stars
being
reduced
so
as
to
exhibit
the
concluded
motion
in
miles
per
second
after
applying
a
correction
for
the
earth
motion
sixteen
measures
of
the
f
line
in
the
spectrum
of
the
moon
as
compared
with
hydrogen
give
a
displacement
corresponding
to
a
motion
of
less
than
two
miles
a
second
which
seems
to
shew
that
the
method
of
comparison
now
adopted
is
free
from
systematic
error
and
this
is
supported
by
the
manner
in
which
motions
of
approach
and
recession
are
distributed
among
the
stars
examined
on
each
night
of
observation
the
results
recently
obtained
appear
to
be
on
the
whole
as
consistent
as
can
be
expected
in
such
delicate
observations
and
they
support
in
a
remarkable
manner
the
conclusions
of
dr
huggins
with
regard
to
the
motions
of
those
stars
which
he
photographs
of
the
sun
have
been
taken
with
the
photoheliograph
on
days
on
one
of
the
photographs
which
was
accidentally
exposed
while
the
drop
slit
was
being
drawn
up
there
appears
to
be
a
faint
image
of
a
prominence
close
to
the
sun
limb
though
the
exposure
probably
only
amounted
to
a
fraction
of
a
second
a
prominence
of
unusual
brilliancy
was
seen
with
the
spectroscope
about
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
position
with
reference
to
the
sun
limb
all
groups
of
and
faculae
have
been
numbered
and
the
dates
of
their
first
and
last
appearances
entered
up
to
the
present
time
areas
of
spots
have
been
measured
and
the
measures
have
been
reduced
to
millionths
of
the
sun
visible
the
examination
of
the
readings
of
the
thermometers
from
to
has
exhibited
some
laws
which
had
been
sufficiently
established
before
this
time
and
some
which
were
less
known
among
the
former
were
the
successive
retardations
of
seasons
in
successive
descents
amounting
to
about
four
months
at
the
depth
of
feet
and
the
successive
diminutions
of
the
annual
range
of
temperature
among
the
latter
is
the
character
of
the
changes
from
year
to
year
which
the
great
length
of
this
series
of
observations
brings
well
to
light
it
is
found
that
from
year
to
year
the
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
for
the
year
varying
by
three
or
four
degrees
of
fahrenheit
follows
in
its
changes
the
mean
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
for
the
year
and
that
the
changes
of
annual
temperature
are
propagated
downwards
retarded
in
phase
and
diminishing
in
amount
of
change
in
the
same
manner
though
probably
not
following
the
same
law
as
the
season
changes
the
inference
from
this
is
that
changes
of
temperature
come
entirely
from
the
exterior
and
in
no
discoverable
degree
from
the
interior
an
inference
which
may
be
important
in
regard
both
to
solar
action
and
to
geology
referring
to
the
transit
of
venus
observations
in
the
astronomical
part
of
the
reductions
there
has
been
great
labour
and
difficulty
in
the
determination
of
local
sidereal
times
some
books
of
observations
required
extensive
transcription
some
instrumental
errors
are
still
uncertain
the
latter
determinations
have
perplexed
us
so
much
that
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
in
spite
of
the
great
facilities
of
reduction
given
by
the
transit
instrument
it
would
be
better
to
rely
on
the
altazimuth
for
in
the
photographic
part
i
have
confined
my
attention
entirely
to
measures
of
the
distance
between
the
centres
of
the
sun
and
planet
a
troublesome
and
complex
referring
to
the
progress
of
the
numerical
lunar
theory
with
a
repetition
of
grant
from
the
treasury
i
have
usually
maintained
four
junior
computers
on
this
work
the
progress
though
considerable
has
not
been
so
great
as
i
had
hoped
by
reason
of
the
excessive
personal
pressure
upon
me
during
the
whole
i
wrote
a
letter
of
congratulation
to
le
verrier
on
the
completion
of
his
great
work
of
planetary
on
may
the
queen
was
at

returned
from
his
playford
visit
on
the
of
in
april
there
was
a
trip
to
from
june
to
july
he
was
travelling
in
the
north
of
scotland
and
the
orkneys
with
his
daughters
staying
for
a
short
time
with
mr
webster
at
aberdeen
and
with
mr
newall
at
in
september
there
was
a
week
run
to
birkenhead
and
in
november
a
week
run
to
from
the
to
of
december
he
was
at
cambridge
and
on
the
he
went
to
playford
for
the
usual
winter
stay
there
in
april
of
this
year
i
was
much
engaged
on
the
subject
of
mr
expedition
to
ascension
to
observe
for
the
determination
of
the
parallax
of
mars
at
the
approaching
opposition
of
that
a
large
spectroscope
has
been
quite
recently
made
by
mr
hilger
under
mr
christie
direction
on
a
new
plan
in
which
either
great
dispersion
or
great
purity
of
spectrum
is
obtained
by
the
use
of
according
as
the
incident
pencil
falls
first
on
the
perpendicular
or
on
the
oblique
face
in
this
spectroscope
either
one
or
two
half
prisms
can
be
used
at
pleasure
according
to
the
dispersion
required
and
there
is
facility
for
increasing
the
train
to
three
or
four
though
the
dispersion
with
two
only
is
nearly
double
of
that
given
by
the
large
spectroscope
the
definition
in
this
form
of
spectroscope
appears
to
be
very
at
the
end
of
may
spectroscopic
determinations
of
the
rotation
were
made
by
observations
of
the
relative
displacement
of
the
fraunhofer
lines
at
the
east
and
west
limbs
respectively
the
results
are
in
close
agreement
with
the
value
of
the
rotation
found
from
observations
of
a
similar
determination

also
been
made
in

case
of

so
far
advanced
that
we
can
assert
positively
that
there
is
no
trace
of

in
the

but
that
there
is
a
strongly
marked
solar
tide

with

are
at

engaged
in

with

there
is
no
extensive
wish
for
separate
magnetic
observations
but
general
magnetic
results
are
in
great
demand
especially
for
mining
operations

to
meet
this
a
map
of

declination
is
furnished
in

the
computing
staff
has
by
degrees
been
reduced
to
two
junior
computers
within
the
observatory
and
one
or
two
computers
external
to
the
observatory
who
are
employed
on
large
groups
of
systematic
calculations
the
principal
part
of
the
calculations
remaining
at
the
date
of
the
last
report
was
that

to
the
determination
of

the
moment
of

of
determining
the
geographical
longitude
of
the
principal

by
vertical
transits
of

been
found
very
successful

the
ordinary
chances
of

abandonment
a
work
which
is
already
one
of
considerable
magnitude
i
have
prepared

february
dear
sir
i
venture
to
ask
if
you
can
assist
me
in
the
following
matter
in
the
parish
church
of
playford
near
ipswich
suffolk
was
a
splendid
brass
tombstone
to
sir
thomas
felbrigg
by
an
act
of
folly
and
barbarism
almost
unequalled
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
incumbent
and
curate
nearly
destroyed
the
brass
inscription
surrounding
the
image
of
the
knight
this
tombstone
is
figured
in
gough
sepulchral
antiquities
which
i
presume
is
to
be
found
in
the
british
museum
and
i
take
the
liberty
to
ask
if
you
would
kindly
look
at
the
engraving
and
give
me
any
suggestion
as
to
the
way
in
which
some
copies
of
it
could
be
made
in
a
fairly
durable
form
i
am
connected
with
the
parish
of
playford
and
am
anxious
to
preserve
for
it
this
memorial
of
a
family
of
high
rank
formerly
resident
there
i
am
dear
sir
very
faithfully
yours
airy
winter
jones
to
this
request
mr
winter
jones
immediately
acceded
and
the
engraving
was
duly
photographed
and
copies
were
circulated
with
a
historical
notice
of
sir
george
not
sir
thomas
felbrigg
and
a
history
of
the
monument
sir
george
felbrigg
was
to
edward
and
lord
of
the
manor
of

he
died
in
and
was
buried
in
the
north
wall
of
playford
church
the
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
has
this
paragraph
i
continue
to
remark
the
approaching
necessity
for
library
extension
without
having
absolutely
decided
on
a
site
i
may
suggest
that
i
should
wish
to
erect
a
brick
building
about
feet
by
consisting
of
two
very
low
stories
or
rather
of
one
story
with
a
gallery
running
round
its
walls
so
low
that
books
can
be
moved
by
hand
without
necessity
for
a
in
the
month
of
december
the
azimuthal
error
of
the
transit
circle
had
increased
to
a
skilful
workman
instructed
by
mr
simms
easily
reduced
the
error
to
about
which
would
leave
its
mean
error
nearly
the
western
y
being
moved
to
the
north
so
far
as
to
reduce
the
reading
of
the
transit
micrometer
when
pointed
to
the
south
from
to
the
level
error
was
not
sensibly
the
sidereal
standard
clock
preserves
a
rate
approaching
to
perfection
so
long
as
it
is
left
without
disturbance
of
the
springs
touched
by
its
pendulum
which
transmit
signals
at
every
second
of
time
to
sympathetic
clocks
and
the
chronograph
a
readjustment
of
these
springs
usually
disturbs
the
to
facilitate
the
observations
of
stars
a
new
working
catalogue
has
been
prepared
in
which
are
included
all
stars
down
to
the
third
magnitude
stars
down
to
the
fifth
magnitude
which
have
not
been
observed
in
the
last
two
catalogues
and
a
list
of
stars
of
about
the
sixth
magnitude
of
which
the
places
are
required
for
the
united
states
coast
survey
the
whole
number
of
stars
in
our
new
working
list
is
about
it
may
be
here
mentioned
that
an
extensive
series
of
observations
was
made
during
the
autumn
of
about
stars
at
the
request
of
mr
gill
for
comparison
with
mars
ariadne
and
on
apr
last
a
very
heavy
fall
of
rain
took
place
between
apr
and
apr
inch
was
recorded
and
per
cent
of
this
or
fell
in
the
eight
hours
between
and
and
on
may
inch
of
rain
fell
in
minutes
of
which
inch
fell
in
the
supplementary
compensation
continues
to
be
applied
with
success
to
government
chronometers
which
offer
facilities
for
its
introduction
and
a
marked
improvement
in
the
performance
of
chronometers
returned
after
repair
by
the
makers
appears
to
have
resulted
from
the
increased
attention
now
given
to
the
compensation
of
the
competitive
chronometers
have
the
supplementary
compensation
with
regard
to
the
reduction
of
the
observations
of
the
transit
of
venus
after
reference
to
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
errors
and
the
interpretation
of
the
language
used
by
some
of
the
observers
the
report
continues
thus
finally
a
report
was
made
to
the
government
on
july
giving
as
the
mean
result
for
mean
solar
parallax
the
results
from
ingress
and
from
egress
however
differing
to
the
extent
of
after
further
examination
and
consideration
the
result
for
parallax
has
been
increased
to
or
the
results
from
photography
have
disappointed
me
much
the
failure
has
arisen
perhaps
sometimes
from
irregularity
of
limb
or
from
atmospheric
distortion
but
more
frequently
from
faintness
and
from
want
of
clear
definition
many
photographs
which
to
the
eye
appeared
good
lost
all
strength
and
sharpness
when
placed
under
the
measuring
microscope
a
final
result
was
obtained
from
mr
burton
measures
and
from
capt
with
regard
to
the
numerical
lunar
theory
a
cursory
collection
of
the
terms
relating
to
the
areas
in
the
ecliptic
led
me
to
suppose
that
there
might
be
some
error
in
the
computations
of
the
annual
equation
and
related
terms
a
most
jealous
has
however
detected
nothing
and
has
confirmed
my
belief
in
the
general
accuracy
of
the
numerical
computations
i
dare
not
yet
venture
to
assume
an
error
in
delaunay
theory
but
i
remember
that
the
annual
equation
gave
great
trouble
to
the
late
sir
john
lubbock
and
that
he
more
than
once
changed
his
conclusions
as
to
its
true
in
february
i
was
engaged
on
the
drawings
and
preparations
for
my
intended
lecture
at
cockermouth
on
the
probable
condition
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
the
lecture
was
delivered
in
at
different
times
in
the
autumn
i
was
engaged
on
diagrams
to
illustrate
the
passage
of
rays
through
and
the
miscellaneous
scientific
correspondence
which
was
always
going
on
was
in
this
year
unusually
varied
and
heavy
of
private
history
he
was
at
playford
till
jan
in
april
he
went
to
cockermouth
to
deliver
his
lecture
the
journey
was
by
birmingham
where
he
stayed
for
two
days
probably
with
his
son
osmund
who
resided
there
to
tarn
bank
the
residence
of
isaac
fletcher
the
lecture
was
delivered
on
the
he
made
excursions
to
thirlmere
and
barrow
and
to
edward
i
monument
and
returned
to
greenwich
on
the
from
june
to
he
was
at
from
to
he
was
travelling
in
scotland
visiting
the
tay
bridge
the
loch
katrine
waterworks
and
spent
the
last
fortnight
of
his
trip
at
portinscale
near
keswick
on
he
went
to
playford
the
manuscripts
of
every
kind
which
are
accumulated
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
the
observatory
are
preserved
with
the
same
care
and
arranged
on
the
same
system
as
heretofore
the
total
number
of
bound
volumes
exceeds
besides
these
there
is
the
great
mass
of
transit
of
venus
reductions
and
manuscripts
which
when
bound
may
be
expected
to
form
about
with
regard
to
the
numerous
group
of
minor
planets
the
berlin
authorities
have
most
kindly
given
attention
to
my
representation
and
we
have
now
a
most
admirable
and
comprehensive
ephemeris
but
the
extreme
faintness
of
the
majority
of
these
bodies
places
them
practically
beyond
the
reach
of
our
meridian
instrument
and
the
difficulty
of
observation
is
in
many
cases
further
increased
by
the
large
errors
of
the
predicted
after
a
fine
autumn
the
weather
in
the
past
winter
and
spring
has
been
remarkably
bad
more
than
an
entire
lunation
was
lost
with
the
transit
circle
no
observation
of
the
moon
on
the
meridian
having
been
possible
between
january
and
march
a
period
of
more
than
seven
weeks
neither
sun
nor
stars
were
visible
for
eleven
days
during
which
period
the
were
carried
on
entirely
by
the
preceding
rate
of
the
clock
the
accumulated
error
at
the
end
of
this
time
did
not
exceed
some
difficulty
was
at
first
experienced
with
the
thomson
electrometer
which
was
traced
to
want
of
insulation
this
has
been
mastered
by
the
use
of
glass
supporters
which
carry
some
sulphuric
acid
the
instrument
is
now
in
excellent
order
and
the
photographic
registers
have
been
perfectly
satisfactory
since
february
when
the
new
insulators
were
from
the
annual
curves
of
diurnal
inequality
deduced
from
the
magnetic
reductions
most
important
inferences
may
be
drawn
as
to
the
connection
between
magnetic
phenomena
and
these
annual
curves
shew
a
change
in
close
correspondence
with
the
number
of
about
the
epoch
of
maximum
of
they
are
large
and
nearly
circular
having
the
same
character
as
the
curves
for
the
summer
months
whilst
about
the
time
of
minimum
they
are
small
and
with
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
curves
for
the
winter
months
the
connection
between
changes
of
terrestrial
magnetism
and
is
shewn
in
a
still
more
striking
manner
by
a
comparison
which
mr
ellis
has
made
between
the
monthly
means
of
the
diurnal
range
of
declination
and
horizontal
force
and
dr
wolf
numbers
for
frequency
of
the
records
of
sunshine
with
campbell
registering
are
preserved
in
a
form
easily
accessible
for
reference
and
the
results
are
communicated
weekly
to
the
agricultural
prof
oppolzer
results
for
the
determination
of
the
longitudes
of
vienna
and
berlin
made
in
have
now
been
made
public
they
shew
a
remarkable
agreement
of
the
chronometric
determination
formerly
made
with
the
telegraphic
it
may
be
of
interest
to
recall
the
fact
that
a
similar
agreement
was
found
between
the
chronometric
and
telegraphic
determinations
of
the
longitude
of
for
observing
the
transit
of
venus
of
the
general
impression
appears
to
be
that
it
will
be
best
to
confine
our
observations
to
simple
telescopic
observations
or
micrometer
observations
at
ingress
and
egress
if
possible
at
places
whose
longitudes
are
known
for
the
first
phenomenon
accelerated
ingress
the
choice
of
stations
is
not
good
but
for
the
other
phenomena
retarded
ingress
accelerated
egress
retarded
egress
there
appears
to
be
no
with
regard
to
the
numerical
lunar
theory
respecting
the
discordance
of
annual
equation
i
suspend
my
judgment
i
have
now
discussed
the
theory
completely
and
in
going
into
details
of
secular
changes
i
am
at
this
time
engaged
on
that
which
is
the
foundation
of
all
namely
the
change
of
excentricity
of
the
solar
orbit
and
its
result
in
producing
lunar
acceleration
an
important
error
in
the
theoretical
formulae
for
variations
of
radius
vector
longitude
and
latitude
was
discovered
some
calculations
depending
on
them
are
cancelled
referring
to
the
magnitude
of
the
printed
volume
of
greenwich
observations
and
the
practicability
of
reducing
the
extent
of
it
the
report
states
thus
the
tendency
of
external
scientific
movement
is
to
give
great
attention
to
the
phenomena
of
the
solar
disc
in
which
this
observatory
ought
undoubtedly
to
bear
its
part
and
i
personally
am
most
unwilling
to
recede
from
the
existing
course
of
magnetical
and
meteorological
observations
general
tendency
of
these
considerations
is
to
increase
the
annual
expenses
of
the
observatory
and
so
it
has
been
almost
continuously
for
the
last
years
the
annual
ordinary
expenses
are
now
between
and
times
as
great
as
in
my
first
years
at
the
royal
mr
gill
was
appointed
to
the
cape
observatory
and
i
wrote
out
instructions
for
him
in
march
there
was
subsequently
much
correspondence
respecting
the
equipment
and
repairs
of
the
cape
observatory
in
the
monthly
notices
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
for
january
an
article
had
appeared
headed
notes
on
the
late
admiral
smyth
cycle
of
celestial
objects
vol
ii
by
mr
herbert
sadler
in
this
article
mr
sadler
had
criticized
the
work
of
admiral
smyth
in
a
manner
which
airy
regarded
as
imputing
bad
faith
to
admiral
smyth
he
at
once
took
up
the
defence
of
his
old
friend
very
warmly
and
proposed
certain
drafts
of
resolutions
to
the
council
of
the
society
these
resolutions
were
moved
but
were
amended
or
negatived
and
airy
immediately
resigned
his
office
of
there
was
considerable
negociation
on
the
subject
and
discussion
with
lord
lindsay
and
on
may
airy
resolutions
were
accepted
by
the
in
october
airy
inspected
the
faraday
telegraph
ship
then
lying
in
the
river
near
messrs
siemens
works
and
broke
his
finger
by
a
fall
on
board
the
in
this
year
airy
wrote
and
circulated
a
letter
to
the
members
of
the
senate
of
the
university
of
cambridge
on
the
subject
of
the
papers
set
in
the
smith
prizes
examination
in
this
letter
as
on
former
occasions
he
objected
much
to
the
large
number
of
questions
in
purely
idle
algebra
arbitrary
combinations
of
symbols
applicable
to
no
further
purpose
and
in
particular
he
singled
out
for
comment
the
following
question
which
was
one
of
those
set
using
the
term
circle
as
extending
to
the
case
where
the
radius
is
a
pure
imaginary
it
is
required
to
construct
the
common
chord
of
two
given
circles
this
drew
forth
as
usual
a
rejoinder
from
cayley
who
wrote
enclosing
a
solution
of
his
problem
but
not
at
all
to
satisfaction
who
replied
as
follows
i
am
not
so
deeply
plunged
in
the
mists
of
impossibles
as
to
appreciate
fully
your
explanation
in
this
instance
or
to
think
that
it
is
a
good
criterion
for
university
candidates
of
private
history
on
he
returned
from
on
march
he
attended
the
funeral
of
his
sister
at
little
welnetham
near
bury
st
edmunds
miss
elizabeth
airy
had
lived
with
him
at
the
observatory
from
shortly
after
his
for
about
a
week
at
the
end
of
april
he
was
visiting
matlock
edensor
and
from
june
to
july
he
was
staying
at
portinscale
near
he
was
at
playford
for
two
or
three
days
in
october
and
went
there
again
on
for
his
usual
winter
holiday
the
following
letter
relating
to
the
life
of
thomas
clarkson
was
written
to
dr
merivale
dean
of
ely
after
reading
the
account
in
the
times
of
october
of
the
unveiling
of
a
statue
of
clarkson
near
ware
royal
observatory
greenwich
london
october
dear
sir
pardon
my
intrusion
on
you
in
reference
to
a
transaction
which
has
greatly
interested
me
the
honour
paid
by
you
to
the
memory
of
thomas
clarkson
with
very
great
pleasure
i
have
heard
of
this
step
and
i
have
also
been
much
satisfied
with
the
remarks
on
it
in
the
times
i
well
remember
in
clarkson
history
of
the
abolition
which
i
read
some
years
ago
the
account
of
the
circumstance
now
commemorated
by
you
which
determined
the
action
of
his
whole
subsequent
life
it
is
not
improbable
that
among
those
who
still
remember
clarkson
my
acquaintance
with
him
began
at
the
earliest
time
of
all
i
knew
him
intimately
from
the
beginning
of
to
his
death
the
family
which
he
represented
must
have
occupied
a
very
good
position
in
society
i
have
heard
that
he
sold
two
good
estates
to
defray
the
expenses
which
he
incurred
in
his
personal
labours
for
abolition
and
his
brother
was
governor
of
sierra
leone
i
know
not
at
what
time
appointed
thomas
clarkson
was
at
st
john
college
and
as
i
gather
from
circumstances
which
i
have
heard
him
mention
must
have
been
a
rather
gay
man
he
kept
a
horse
and
at
one
time
kept
two
he
took
orders
in
the
church
and
on
one
occasion
in
the
course
of
his
abolition
struggle
he
preached
in
a
church
but
he
afterwards
resolutely
laid
aside
all
pretensions
to
the
title
of
minister
of
the
church
and
never
would
accept
any
title
except
as
layman
he
was
however
a
very
earnest
reader
of
theology
during
my
acquaintance
with
him
and
appeared
to

i
have
not
identified
the
place
from
a
view
which
he
once
shewed
me
i
supposed
it
to
be
near
the
bottom
of
the

but
from
an
account
of
the
storm
of
wind
which
he
encountered
when
walking
with
a
lady
over
a
pass
it
seemed
to
be
in

near
patterdale
when
the
remains
of
a
mountaineer
who
perished
in
helvellyn
as
described
in
scott
poem
were
discovered
by
a
shepherd
it
was
to
mr
clarkson
that
the
intelligence
was
first
brought
he
then
lived
at
bury
st

mrs
clarkson
was
a
lady
of
bury
but
i
can
not
assign
conjecturally
any
dates
to
his
removals
or
his
marriage
his
only
son
took
his

think
about

think
it
was
in
that
he
began
his
occupation
of
playford

a
moated
mansion
near
ipswich
formerly
of
great
importance
where
he
lived

occupying
a

i
was
most
intimately
acquainted
lived
in
the

parish
where
in
defiance
of
school
rules
i
spent
nearly
half
my
time
to
my
great
advantage
as
i
believe
and
where
i
still
retain
a
cottage
for
occasional
residence
and
i
enjoyed
much
of
mr
clarkson
notice
it
was
by
his
strong
advice
that
i
was
sent
to
cambridge
and
that
trinity
college
was
selected
he
rode
with
me
to
rev
mr

for
introductory
examination
he
introduced
me
to

subsequently
of
halifax
accidentally
doing

at

who
then
introduced
me
to
sedgwick
peacock

i
spent
the

he
introduced

lived
about
thirty
years
at

died
there

final
consideration
of

and
some
danger

rendering
all
further

purpose
many
years

were
formed
by
the

of
a

of

was
prepared
by
mr
dollond
for
capt
smyth
adopting
the
same
principle
on
a
larger
scale
i
have
had
constructed
by
mr
hilger
a
micrometer
with
double
refraction
of
a
sphere
of
iceland
spar
marks
have
been
prepared
for
examination
of
the

but
i
have
not
yet
had
opportunity
of
trying

steadily
pursued
the

taken
from
a
working
list
of
stars
which
may
eventually
be
extended
to
include
all
stars
down
to
the
fourth
magnitude
and
it
is
expected
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
motions
of

may
be

been
applied
by
mr
browning
to

it
is
proposed
to
make
such
modification
as
will
give
a
scale
extending
to
lbs
pressure
on
the
square
foot
other
parts
of
the
instrument
have
also
been
as
regards
the
reduction
of
the

of
the
forms
of
the
individual
curves
their
relations

their
connection
with
solar
or
meteorological
facts
the
conjectural
causes
by
which
they
are
produced
there
is
much
to
occupy
the
mind
i
regret
that
though
in
contemplation
of
these
curves
i
have
remarked
some
singular
but
imperfect
laws
i
have
not
been
able
to
pursue

of
determining
telegraphically
the

made
with

on
four
nights

to
the
results
communicated
by
commander
green
shew
that
the
longitude
of
lisbon
observatory
as
adopted
in
the
nautical
almanac
requires
the
large
correction
of
with
regard
to
the
coming
transit
of
venus
in
from
the
facility
with
which
the
requirements
for
geographical
position
are
satisfied
and
from
the
rapid
and
accurate
communication
of
time
now
given
by
electric
telegraph
the
observation
of
this
transit
will
be
comparatively
easy
and
inexpensive
i
have
attached
greater
importance
than
i
did
formerly
to
the
elevation
of
the
sun
i
remark
that
it
is
highly
desirable
that
steps
be
taken
now
for
determining
by
telegraph
the
longitude
of
some
point
of
australia
i
have
stated
as
the
general
opinion
that
it
will
be
useless
to
repeat
photographic
observations

mr
barlow
called
in
reference
to
the
enquiry
on
the
tay
bridge
disaster
the
bridge
had
been
blown
down
on
i
prepared
a
memorandum
on
the
subject
for
the
tay
bridge
commission
and
gave
evidence
in
a
committee
room
of
the
house
of
lords
on

of
the
astronomer

evidence
on
this
occasion
had
reference
to
the
opinions
which
he
had
expressed
concerning
the
which
might
be
expected
on
the
projected
forth
bridge
in
in

airy
was
consulted
by
the
in
the
matter
of
a
dispute
which
had
arisen
between
the
post
office
and
the
telephone
companies
which
latter
were
alleged
to
have
infringed
the
monopoly
of
the
post
office
in
commercial
telegraphs
airy
made
a
declaration
on
the
in
july
mr
bakhuyzen
came
to
england
to
determine
the
longitude
of
leyden
on
which
he
was
engaged
till
and
carried
on
his
observations
at
the
in
july
airy
was
much
engaged
in
perusing
the
records
of
mr
gill
work
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
of
private
history
on
he
returned
from
from
june
to
july
he
was
again
at
from
september
to
october
he
was
staying
at
portinscale
near
on
he
went
again
to
playford
for
his
winter
holiday
respecting
the
agitation
at
cambridge
for
granting
university
degrees
to
women
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
addressed
to
a
young
lady
who
had
forwarded
a
memorial
on
the
subject
for
his
consideration
and
dated
contains
airy
views
on
this
matter
i
have
not
signed
the
memorial
which
you
sent
for
my
consideration
and
i
will
endeavour
to
tell
you
why
i
entirely
approve
of
education
of
young
women
to
a
higher
pitch
than
they
do
commonly
reach
i
think
that
they
can
successfully
advance
so
far
as
to
be
able
clearly
to
understand
with
gratification
to
themselves
and
with
advantage
to
those
whose
education
they
will
superintend
much
of
the
results
of
the
highest
class
of
science
which
have
been
obtained
by
men
whose
lives
are
in
great
measure
devoted
to
it
but
i
do
not
think
that
their
nature
or
their
employments
will
permit
of
their
mastering
the
steps
of
beginning
and
indeed
all
through
and
the
steps
at
the
end
and
i
think
it
well
that
this
their
success
should
be
well
known
as
it
is
sure
to
be
among
their
relatives
their
friends
their
visitors
and
all
in
whom
they
are
likely
to
take
interest
their
connection
with
such
a
place
as
girton
college
is
i
think
sufficient
to
lead
to
this
but
i
desire
above
all
that
all
this
be
done
in
entire
subservience
to
what
i
regard
as
more
valuable
than
any
amount
of
knowledge
namely
the
delicacy
of
woman
character
and
here
i
think
our
views
totally
separate
i
do
not
imagine
that
the
university
degree
would
really
imply
as
regards
education
anything
more
than
is
known
to
all
persons
socially
concerned
in
the
happiness
of
the
young
woman
from
the
less
public
testimonial
of
the
able
men
who
have
the
means
of
knowing
their
merits
and
thus
it
appears
to
me
that
the
admission
to
university
degree
would
simply
mean
a
more
extended
publication
of
their
names
i
dread
this
the
new
line
of
underground
telegraph
wires
has
been
completed
by
the
officers
of
the
general
post
office
the
new
route
is
down
hill
in
greenwich
and
the
result
of
this
change
at
least
as
regards
the
wires
and
probably
as
regards
the
other
wires
has
not
been
satisfactory
it
was
soon
found
that
the
indications
of
the
wires
were
disturbed
by
a
continual
series
of
petty
fluctuations
which
almost
completely
masked
the
proper
features
of
earth
currents
if
this
fault
can
not
be
removed
i
should
propose
to
return
to
our
original
system
of
independent
wires
formerly
to
croydon
and
dartford
the
new
for
the
altazimuth
upon
the
parapet
of
the
naval
college
is
found
to
be
perfectly
satisfactory
as
regards
both
steadiness
and
visibility
the
observations
of
a
low
star
for
zero
of
azimuth
have
been
omitted
since
the
beginning
of
the
mark
in
combination
with
a
high
star
appearing
to
give
all
that
is
necessary
for
this
all
the
instruments
have
suffered
from
the
congealing
of
the
oil
during
the
severe
weather
of
the
past
winter
and
very
thorough
cleaning
of
all
the
moving
parts
has
been
the
solar
eclipse
of
was
well
observed
the
first
contact
was
observed
by
four
observers
and
the
last
contact
by
two
the
computations
for
the
observations
have
been
exceptionally
heavy
from
the
circumstance
that
the
sun
was
very
low
at
the
last
observation
and
that
it
has
therefore
been
necessary
to
compute
the
refraction
with
great
accuracy
involving
the
calculation
of
the
zenith
distance
for
every
observation
and
besides
this
separate
computations
of
the
tabular
and
of
cusps
have
been
amongst
other
interesting
spectroscopic
observations
of
the
sun
a
remarkable
spectrum
of
a
shewing
strong
black
lines
or
bands
each
as
broad
as
in
the
solar
spectrum
was
observed
on
and
these
bands
to
which
there
is
nothing
corresponding
in
the
solar
spectrum
except
some
very
faint
lines
have
also
been
subsequently
remarked
in
the
spectrum
of
several
the
police
ship
which
was
injured
by
a
collision
in
and
had
been
laid
up
in
dock
has
not
been
again
moored
in
the
river
and
the
series
of
observations
of
the
temperature
of
the
thames
is
thus
terminated
part
of
the
month
of
january
was
as
regards
cold
especially
severe
the
mean
temperature
of
the
period
january
to
days
was
only
or
below
the
average
the
temperature
fell
below
on
days
and
rose
above
the
freezing
point
only
on
days
the
highest
temperature
in
this
period
was
the
lowest
on
january
while
staying
at
playford
my
son
hubert
and
i
noticed
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
in
the
upper
clouds
from
the
on
that
night
began
the
terrible
easterly
gale
accompanied
with
much
snow
which
lasted
to
the
night
of
the
the
limiting
pressure
of
lbs
on
the
square
foot
of
osler
anemometer
was
twice
exceeded
during
this
with
respect
to
the
diurnal
inequalities
of
magnetic
horizontal
force
assuming
it
to
be
certain
that
they
originate
from
the
sun
power
not
immediately
but
mediately
through
his
action
on
the
earth
it
appears
to
me
as
i
suggested
long
ago
that
they
are
the
effects
of
the
attraction
of
the
red
end
or
north
end
of
the
needle
by
the
heated
portions
of
our
globe
especially
by
the
heated
sea
whose
effect
appears
to
predominate
greatly
over
that
of
the
land
i
do
not
say
that
everything
is
thus
made
perfectly
clear
but
i
think
that
the
leading
phenomena
may
be
thus
explained
and
this
is
almost
necessarily
the
way
of
beginning
a
in
the
first
few
years
after
the
strict
and
systematic
examination
of
competitive
chronometers
beginning
with
the
accuracy
of
chronometers
was
greatly
increased
for
many
years
past
it
has
been
nearly
stationary
i
interpret
this
as
shewing
that
the
effects
of
bad
workmanship
are
almost
eliminated
and
that
future
improvement
must
be
sought
in
change
of
some
points
of
referring
to
the
transit
of
venus
in
the
printing
of
all
sections
of
the
observations
with
specimens
of
the
printed
forms
employed
and
remarks
on
the
photographic
operations
is
very
nearly
completed
an
introduction
is
begun
in
manuscript
i
am
in
correspondence
with
the
commission
which
is
entrusted
with
the
arrangements
for
observation
of
the
transit
of
the
numerical
lunar
theory
has
been
much
interrupted
by
the
pressure
of
the
transit
of
venus
work
and
other
business
in
his
report
to
the
board
of
visitors
his
and
last
airy
remarks
that
it
would
be
a
fitting
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
his
views
on
the
general
objects
of
the
observatory
and
on
the
duties
which
they
impose
on
all
who
are
actively
concerned
in
its
conduct
and
this
he
proceeds
to
do
in
very
considerable
on
may
he
wrote
to
lord
northbrook
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
to
mr
gladstone
to
resign
his
post
of
astronomer
royal
from
time
to
time
he
was
engaged
on
the
subject
of
a
house
for
his
future
residence
and
finally
took
a
lease
of
the
white
house
at
the
top
of
croom
hill
just
outside
one
of
the
gates
of
greenwich
park
on
the
of
august
he
formally
resigned
his
office
to
mr
christie
who
had
been
appointed
to
succeed
him
as
astronomer
royal
and
removed
to
the
white
house
on
the
next
day
august
his
holiday
movements
in
the
portion
of
the
year
up
to
august
consisted
in
his
winter
visit
to
playford
from
which
he
returned
on
and
a
subsequent
visit
to
playford
from
june
to
the
following
correspondence
relating
to
airy
retirement
from
office
testifies
in
a
remarkable
manner
to
the
estimation
in
which
his
services
were
held
and
to
the
good
feeling
which
subsisted
between
him
and
his
official
superiors
downing

can
not

just
conveyed

me
without
expressing
my
strong
sense
of
the
distinction
you
have
conferred

of
the
difficulty

the
long
period
of
years
i
am
further
to
add
that
their
lordships
can
not
allow
the
present
opportunity
to
pass
without
giving
expression
to
their
sense
of
the
loss
which
the
public
service
must
sustain
by
your
retirement
and
to
the
hope
that
you
may
long
enjoy
the
rest
to
which
you
are
so
justly
entitled

june
sir
my
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
have
much
pleasure
in
transmitting
copy
of
a
resolution
passed
by
the
board
of
visitors
of
the
royal
observatory
on
the
june
last
bearing
testimony
to
the
valuable
services
you
have
rendered
to
astronomy
to
navigation
and
the
allied
sciences
throughout
the
long
period
during
which
you
have
presided
over
the
royal
observatory
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
robert
hall
george
biddell
airy
royal
observatory
the
astronomer
royal
sir
george
airy
having
announced
his
intention
of
shortly
retiring
from
his
position
at
the
royal
observatory
the
following
resolution
proposed
by
professor
adams
and
seconded
by
professor
stokes
was
then
unanimously
adopted
and
ordered
to
be
recorded
in
the
minutes
of
the
proceedings
the
board
having
heard
from
the
astronomer
royal
that
he
proposes
to
terminate
his
connection
with
the
observatory
on
the
of
august
next
desire
to
record
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
their
sense
of
the
eminent
services
which
he
has
rendered
to
astronomy
to
navigation
and
the
allied
sciences
throughout
the
long
period
of
years
during
which
he
has
presided
over
the
royal
observatory
they
consider
that
during
that
time
he
has
not
only
maintained
but
has
greatly
extended
the
ancient
reputation
of
the
institution
and
they
believe
that
the
astronomical
and
other
work
which
has
been
carried
on
in
it
under
his
direction
will
form
an
enduring
monument
of
his
scientific
insight
and
his
powers
of
organization
among
his
many
services
to
science
the
following
are
a
few
which
they
desire
especially
to
commemorate
a
the
complete
of
the
equipment
of
the
observatory
b
the
designing
of
instruments
of
exceptional
stability
and
delicacy
suitable
for
the
increased
accuracy
of
observation
demanded
by
the
advance
of
astronomy
c
the
extension
of
the
means
of
making
observations
of
the
moon
in
such
portions
of
her
orbit
as
are
not
accessible
to
the
transit
circle
d
the
investigation
of
the
effect
of
the
iron
of
ships
upon
compasses
and
the
correction
of
the
errors
thence
arising
e
the
establishment
at
the
observatory
and
elsewhere
of
a
system
of
time
signals
since
extensively
developed
by
the
government
the
board
feel
it
their
duty
to
add
that
sir
george
airy
has
at
all
times
devoted
himself
in
the
most
unsparing
manner
to
the
business
of
the
observatory
and
has
watched
over
its
interests
with
an
assiduity
inspired
by
the
strongest
personal
attachment
to
the
institution
he
has
availed
himself
zealously
of
every
scientific
discovery
and
invention
which
was
in
his
judgment
capable
of
adaptation
to
the
work
of
the
observatory
and
the
long
series
of
his
annual
reports
to
the
board
of
visitors
furnish
abundant
evidence
if
such
were
needed
of
the
soundness
of
his
judgment
in
the
appreciation
of
suggested
changes
and
of
his
readiness
to
introduce
improvements
when
the
proper
time
arrived
while
maintaining
the
most
remarkable
punctuality
in
the
reduction
and
publication
of
the
observations
made
under
his
own
superintendance
he
had
reduced
collected
and
thus
rendered
available
for
use
by
astronomers
the
lunar
and
planetary
observations
of
his
predecessors
nor
can
it
be
forgotten
that
notwithstanding
his
absorbing
occupations
his
advice
and
assistance
have
always
been
at
the
disposal
of
astronomers
for
any
work
of
importance
to
refer
in
detail
to
his
labours
in
departments
of
science
not
directly
connected
with
the
royal
observatory
may
seem
to
lie
beyond
the
province
of
the
board
but
it
can
not
be
improper
to
state
that
its
members
are
not
unacquainted
with
the
high
estimation
in
which
his
contributions
to
the
theory
of
tides
to
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
and
to
various
abstract
branches
of
mathematics
are
held
by
men
of
science
throughout
the
world
in
conclusion
the
board
would
express
their
earnest
hope
that
in
his
retirement
sir
george
airy
may
enjoy
health
and
strength
and
that
leisure
for
which
he
has
often
expressed
a
desire
to
enable
him
not
only
to
complete
the
numerical
lunar
theory
on
which
he
has
been
engaged
for
some
years
past
but
also
to
advance
astronomical
science
in
other
directions

royal

greenwich
august
dear
sir
we
can
not
allow
the
official
relation
which
has
so
long
existed
between
yourself
and
us
to
terminate
without
expressing
to
you
our
sense
of
the
admirable
manner
in
which
you
have
in
our
opinion
upheld
the
dignity
of
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
during
the
many
years
that
you
have
occupied
that
important
post
your
long
continued
and
varied
scientific
work
has
received
such
universal
recognition
from
astronomers
in
all
lands
that
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
do
more
than
assure
you
how
heartily
we
join
in
their
appreciation
of
your
labours
we
may
however
add
that
our
position
has
given
us
opportunities
of
seeing
that
which
others
can
not
equally
well
know
the
untiring
energy
and
great
industry
which
have
been
therein
displayed
throughout
a
long
and
laborious
career
an
energy
which
leads
you
in
retirement
and
at
fourscore
years
of
age
to
contemplate
further
scientific
work
we
would
ask
you
to
carry
with
you
into
private
life
the
best
wishes
of
each
one
of
us
for
your
future
happiness
and
that
of
your
family
expressing
the
hope
that
the
days
of
retirement
may
not
be
few
and
assuring
you
that
your
name
will
long
live
in
our
remembrance

very
great
pleasure

have
received
your

i
thank
you
much
for
your
recognition
of
the
general
success
of
the
observatory
and
of
a
portion
of
its
conduct
which
as
you
remark
can
scarcely
be
known
except
to
those
who
are
every
day
engaged
in
it
but
i
thank
you
still
more
for
the
kind
tone
of
your
letter
which
seems
to
shew
that
the
terms
on
which
we
have
met
are
such
as
leaves
after
so
many
years
intercourse
no
shadow
of
complaint
on
any
side
reciprocating
your
wishes
for
a
happy

and
in
your
case
a
progressive
and
successful
one
i
am
my
dear
mr

gentlemen
yours
faithfully
airy
throughout
his
tenure
of
office
airy
had
cultivated
and
maintained
the
most
friendly
relations
with
foreign
astronomers
to
the
great
advantage
of
the
observatory
probably
all
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
had
visited
greenwich
and
to
most
of
them
he
was
well
known
on
his
retirement
from
office
he
received
an
illuminated
address
from
his
old
friend
otto
struve
and
the
staff
of
the
pulkowa
observatory
an
illuminated
address
from
the

at

signed
by
dr

and
the

a
complimentary

and
friendly
letters
of
sympathy
from
dr
gould
newcombe
dr

and
from
many
other
scientific
friends
and
societies
his
replies
to
the

were
as

my
dear
sir
i
received
with
feelings
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
address
of
yourself
and
the
astronomers
of
pulkowa
generally
on
the
occasion
of
my
retirement
from
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
i
can
scarcely
credit
myself
with
possessing
all
the
varied
claims
to
your
scientific
regard
which
you
detail
i
must
be
permitted
to
attribute
many
of
them
to
the
long
and
warm
friendship
which
has
subsisted
so
long
between
the
directors
of
the
pulkowa
observatory
and
myself
and
which
has
influenced
the
feelings
of
the
whole
body
of
astronomers
attached
to
that
institution
on
one
point
however
i
willingly
accept
your
favourable
expressions
i
have
not
been
sparing
of
my
personal
labour
and
to
this
i
must
attribute
partial
success
on
some
of
the
subjects
to
which
you
allude
in
glancing
over
the
marginal
list
of
scientific
pursuits
i
remark
with
pleasure
the
reference
to
i
still
recur
with
delight
to
the
undulatory
theory
once
the
branch
of
science
on
which
i
was
best
known
to
the
world
and
which
by
calculations
writings
and
lectures
i
supported
against
the
laplacian
school
but
the
close
of
your
remarks
touches
me
much
more
the
association
of
the
name
of
struve
and
my
own
i
respected
deeply
the
whole
character
of
your
father
and
i
believe
that
he
had
confidence
in
me
from
our
first
meeting
in
on
a
commission
for
improvement
of
the
nautical
almanac
i
never
ceased
to
regard
him
as
superior
to
others
i
may
be
permitted
to
add
that
the
delivery
of
his
authority
to
the
hands
of
his
son
has
not
weakened
the
connection
of
myself
with
the
observatory
of
poulkova
acknowledging
gratefully
your
kindness
and
that
of
all
the
astronomers
of
the

of

and
the
astronomers
of

royal
observatory
greenwich
august
my
dear
sir
with
very
great
pleasure
i
received
the
address
of
the
astronomische

on
occasion
of
my
intended
resignation
of
the
office
of
astronomer

dated
july
and
signed
by
yourself
as
president
and
messrs

thank
you
much
for
the
delicacy
of
your
arrangement
for
the
transmission
of
this
document
by
the
hands
of
our
friend
dr
huggins
and
i
think
you
will
be
gratified
to
learn
that
it
arrived
at
a
moment
when
i
was
surrounded
by
my
whole
family
assembled
at
my
and
that
it
added
greatly
to
the
happiness
of
the
party
i
may
perhaps
permit
myself
to
accept
your
kind
recognition
of
my
devotion
of
time
and
thought
to
the
interests
of
my
science
and
my
office
it
is
full
reward
to
me
that
they
are
so
recognized
as
to
the
success
or
utility
of
these
efforts
without
presuming
myself
to
form
an
opinion
i
acknowledge
that
the
connection
made
by
the
astronomische
gesellschaft
between
my
name
and
the
advance
of
modern
astronomy
is
most
flattering
and
will
always
be
remembered
by
me
with
pride
it
is
true
as
is
suggested
in
your
address
that
one
motive
for
my
resignation
of
office
was
the
desire
to
find
myself
more
free
for
the
prosecution
of
further
astronomical
investigations
should
my
health
remain
unbroken
i
hope
to
enter
shortly
upon
this
undertaking
again
acknowledging
the
kindness
of
yourself
and
the
vorstand
of
the
astronomische
gesellschaft
and
offering
my
best
wishes
for
the
continued
success
of
that
honourable
institution

on
august
to
his
death
on
january
history
of
his
life
after
his
resignation
of
office
on
the
of
august
airy
left
the
observatory
which
had
been
his
residence
for
nearly
years
and
removed
to
the
white
house
whatever
his
feelings
may
have
been
at
the
severing
of
his
old
associations
he
carefully
kept
them
to
himself
and
entered
upon
his
new
life
with
the
cheerful
composure
and
steadiness
of
temper
which
he
possessed
in
a
remarkable
degree
he
was
now
more
than
years
old
and
the
cares
of
office
had
begun
to
weigh
heavily
upon
him
the
drag
of
the
transit
of
venus
work
had
wearied
him
and
he
was
anxious
to
carry
on
and
if
possible
complete
his
numerical
lunar
theory
the
great
work
which
for
some
years
had
occupied
much
of
his
time
and
attention
his
mental
powers
were
still
vigorous
and
his
energy
but
little
impaired
his
strong
constitution
his
regular
habits
of
life
the
systematic
relief
which
he
obtained
by
short
holiday
expeditions
whenever
he
found
himself
worn
with
work
and
his
keen
interest
in
history
poetry
classics
antiquities
engineering
and
other
subjects
not
immediately
connected
with
his
profession
had
combined
to
produce
this
result
and
in
leaving
office
he
had
no
idea
of
leaving
off
work
his
resignation
of
office
merely
meant
for
him
a
change
of
work
it
is
needless
to
say
that
his
interest
in
the
welfare
and
progress
of
the
observatory
was
as
keen
as
ever
his
advice
was
always
at
the
service
of
his
successor
and
his
appointment
as
visitor
a
year
or
two
after
his
resignation
gave
him
an
official
position
with
regard
to
the
observatory
which
he
much
valued
the
white
house
which
was
to
be
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
is
just
outside
one
of
the
upper
gates
of
the
park
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
observatory
here
he
resided
with
his
two
unmarried
daughters
the
house
suited
him
well
and
he
was
very
comfortable
there
he
preferred
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
and
in
which
he
was
so
well
known
rather
than
to
remove
to
a
distance
his
daily
habits
of
life
were
but
little
altered
he
worked
steadily
as
formerly
took
his
daily
walk
on
blackheath
made
frequent
visits
to
playford
and
occasional
expeditions
to
the
cumberland
lakes
and
elsewhere
the
work
to
which
he
chiefly
devoted
himself
in
his
retirement
was
the
completion
of
his
numerical
lunar
theory
this
was
a
vast
work
involving
the
subtlest
considerations
of
principle
very
long
and
elaborate
mathematical
investigations
of
a
high
order
and
an
enormous
amount
of
arithmetical
computation
the
issue
of
it
was
unfortunate
he
concluded
that
there
was
an
error
in
some
of
the
early
work
which
vitiated
the
results
obtained
and
although
the
whole
process
was
published
and
was
left
in
such
a
state
that
it
would
be
a
comparatively
simple
task
for
a
future
astronomer
to
correct
and
complete
it
yet
it
was
not
permitted
to
the
original
author
of
it
to
do
this
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
frequent
reference
to
this
work
in
the
history
of
airy
remaining
years
it
will
be
convenient
to
summarize
it
here
it
was
commenced
in
on
in
this
year
i
first
privately
formed
the
notion
of
preparing
a
numerical
lunar
theory
by
substituting
delaunay
numbers
in
the
proper
equations
and
seeing
what
would
come
of
it
from
this
time
forward
till
his
power
to
continue
it
absolutely
failed
he
pursued
the
subject
with
his
usual
tenacity
of
purpose
during
his
tenure
of
office
every
available
opportunity
was
seized
for
making
progress
with
his
lunar
theory
and
in
every
report
to
the
visitors
a
careful
statement
was
inserted
of
the
state
in
which
it
then
stood
and
after
his
resignation
of
office
it
formed
the
bulk
of
his
occupation
in
the
theory
was
formed
and
by
it
was
so
far
advanced
that
he
published
in
the
monthly
notices
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
a
statement
of
the
fundamental
points
of
the
theory
in
the
theory
having
advanced
to
a
stage
where
extensive
arithmetical
computation
was
required
he
obtained
a
small
grant
from
the
government
in
aid
of
the
expense
of
the
work
and
other
grants
were
made
in
subsequent
years
by
the
calculations
were
so
far
advanced
that
an
opinion
could
be
formed
as
to
the
probable
accuracy
of
the
theory
and
the
following
remark
is
made
a
cursory
collation
of
the
terms
relating
to
the
areas
in
the
ecliptic
led
me
to
suppose
that
there
might
be
some
error
in
the
computations
of
the
annual
equation
and
related
terms
but
no
error
could
be
discovered
and
the
work
proceeded
the
complex
character
of
the
theory
and
the
extreme
care
required
in
the
mathematical
processes
are
well
illustrated
by
the
following
statement
which
occurs
in
the
report
of
an
important
error
in
the
theoretical
formulae
for
variations
of
radius
vector
longitude
and
latitude
was
discovered
some
calculations
depending
on
them
are
cancelled
in
and
the
work
was
continued
but
was
sadly
interrupted
by
the
pressure
of
the
transit
of
venus
work
and
other
business
after
his
resignation
of
the
office
of
astronomer
royal
he
had
no
further
public
assistance
and
did
much
of
the
computations
himself
but
a
sum
of
was
contributed
by
mr
de
la
rue
in
furtherance
of
the
work
and
this
sum
was
spent
on
computers
in
his
retirement
the
work
made
good
progress
and
on
he
made
the
following
note
i
finished
and
put
in
general
order
the
final
tables
of
equations
of
variations
this
is
a
definite
point
in
the
lunar
theory
i
hope
shortly
to
take
up
severely
the
numerical
operations
of
the
lunar
theory
from
the
very
beginning
the
work
was
continued
steadily
through
and
on
mar
he
made
application
through
the
board
of
visitors
to
the
admiralty
to
print
the
work
after
the
usual
enquiries
as
to
the
expense
this
was
acceded
to
and
copy
was
sent
to
the
printers
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
the
first
printed
proofs
were
received
on
and
the
whole
book
was
printed
by
the
end
of
from
the
frequent
references
in
his
journal
to
errors
discovered
and
corrected
during
the
progress
of
these
calculations
it
would
seem
likely
that
his
powers
were
not
what
they
had
been
and
that
there
was
a
probability
that
some
important
errors
might
escape
correction
he
was
far
too
honest
to
blind
himself
to
this
possibility
and
in
the
preface
to
his
numerical
lunar
theory
he
says
thus
i
have
explained
above
that
the
principle
of
operations
was
to
arrange
the
fundamental
mechanical
equations
in
a
form
suited
for
the
investigations
of
lunar
theory
to
substitute
in
the
terms
of
these
equations
the
numerical
values
furnished
by
delaunay
great
work
and
to
examine
whether
the
equations
are
thereby
satisfied
with
painful
alarm
i
find
that
they
are
not
satisfied
and
that
the
discordance
or
failure
of
satisfying
the
equations
is
large
the
critical
trial
depends
on
the
great
mass
of
computations
in
section
ii
these
have
been
made
in
duplicate
with
all
the
care
for
accuracy
that
anxiety
could
supply
still
i
can
not
but
fear
that
the
error
which
is
the
source
of
discordance
must
be
on
my
part
i
can
not
conjecture
whether
i
may
be
able
to
examine
sufficiently
into
this
matter
he
resolutely
took
in
hand
the
revision
of
his
work
and
continued
it
till
october
but
it
is
clear
from
the
entries
in
his
journal
that
his
powers
were
now
unequal
to
the
task
and
although
from
time
to
time
he
suspected
that
he
had
discovered
errors
yet
it
does
not
appear
that
he
determined
anything
with
certainty
he
never
doubted
that
there
were
important
errors
in
the
work
and
later
on
he
left
the
following
private
note
on
the
subject
numerical
lunar
theory
i
had
made
considerable
advance
under
official
difficulties
in
calculations
on
my
favourite
numerical
lunar
theory
when
i
discovered
that
under
the
heavy
pressure
of
unusual
matters
two
transits
of
venus
and
some
eclipses
i
had
committed
a
grievous
error
in
the
first
stage
of
giving
numerical
value
to
my
theory
my
spirit
in
the
work
was
broken
and
i
have
never
heartily
proceeded
with
it
since
airy
probably
the
error
referred
to
here
is
the
suspected
error
mentioned
above
in
his
report
of
as
to
which
he
subsequently
became
more
certain
whatever
may
be
the
imperfections
of
the
numerical
lunar
theory
it
is
a
wonderful
work
to
have
been
turned
out
by
a
man
years
old
in
its
idea
and
inception
it
embodies
the
experience
of
a
long
life
actively
spent
in
practical
science
and
it
may
be
that
it
will
yet
fulfil
the
objects
of
its
author
and
that
some
younger
astronomer
may
take
it
up
correct
its
errors
wherever
they
may
be
and
fit
it
for
practical
use
and
then
the
labour
bestowed
upon
it
will
not
have
been
in
vain
subject
always
to
the
absorbing
occupations
of
the
lunar
theory
he
amused
himself
with
reading
his
favourite
subjects
of
history
and
antiquities
his
movements
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
were
as
follows
in
september
he
paid
a
two
days
visit
to
lady
herschel
at
hawkhurst
from
to
he
was
at
the
cumberland
lakes
and
engaged
in
expeditions
in
the
neighbourhood
from
to
he
was
at
cambridge
inspecting
stuart
workshops
and
other
scientific
institutions
on
he
went
to
amongst
miscellaneous
matters
in
november
he
wrote
to
mr
rothery
on
the
loss
of
the
at
some
length
with
suggestions
for
the
safer
construction
of
such
in
october
he
was
asked
for
suggestions
regarding
the
establishment
of
a
standard
time
applicable
to
the
railway
traffic
in
the
united
states
he
replied
as
follows
sir
i
have
to
acknowledge
your
letter
of
october
introducing
to
my
notice
the
difficulty
which
appears
to
be
arising
in
america
regarding
a
standard
time
for
extensive
use
throughout
america
applicable
to
railway
traffic
only
the
subject
as
including
considerations
of
convenience
in
all
the
matters
to
which
it
applies
is
one
of
difficulties
probably
insuperable
the
certainty
however
that
objections
may
be
raised
to
every
scheme
renders
me
less
timid
in
offering
my
own
remarks
which
are
much
at
your
service
i
first
comment
upon
your
expression
of
standard
time
applicable
to
railway
traffic
only
but
do
you
mean
this
as
affecting
the
transactions
between
one
railway
and
another
railway
or
as
affecting
each
railway
and
the
local
interests
temporal
and
others
of
the
towns
which
it
touches
the
difference
is
so
great
that
i
should
be
disposed
to
adopt
it
as
marking
very
strongly
the
difference
to
be
made
between
the
practices
of
railways
among
themselves
and
the
practices
of
railways
towards
the
public
and
will
base
a
system
on
that
difference
as
regards
the
practices
of
railways
among
themselves
if
the
various
railways
of
america
are
joined
and
inosculated
as
they
are
in
england
it
appears
to
me
indispensable
that
they
have
one
common
standard
say
washington
observatory
time
but
this
is
only
needed
for
the
between
the
railways
it
may
be
kept
perfectly
private
never
communicated
to
the
public
at
all
and
i
should
recommend
this
as
the
first
step
there
will
then
be
no
difficulty
in
deducing
from
these
private
washington
times
the
accurate
local
times
at
those
stations
whose
longitude
is
supposed
to
be
fairly
well
known
as
a
sailor
with
a
sextant
can
determine
one
in
a
few
hours
which
the
railway
authorities
may
deem
worthy
of
that
honour
generally
the
termini
of
railways
thus
we
shall
have
a
series
of
bases
of
local
time
of
authoritative
character
through
the
country
of
such
bases
have
two
greenwich
and
dublin
and
they
are
separated
by
a
in
the
of
america
there
must
be
a
greater
number
and
probably
not
so
well
separated
still
it
is
indispensable
to
adopt
such
a
system
of
local
centers
no
people
in
this
world
can
be
induced
to
use
a
reckoning
which
does
not
depend
clearly
upon
the
sun
in
all
civilized
countries
it
depends
approximately
on
the
sun
meridian
passage
even
the
sailor
on
refers
to
that
phenomenon
and
the
solar
passage
with
reasonable
allowance
or
one
way
or
another
must
be
recognized
in
all
as
giving
the
fundamental
time
the
only
practical
way
of
doing
this
is
to
adopt
for
a
whole
region
the
fundamental
time
of
a
center
of
that
region
and
to
this
fundamental
time
the
local
time
of
the
railway
as
now
entering
into
all
the
concerns
of
life
must
be
adapted
a
solicitor
has
an
appointment
to
meet
a
client
by
railway
a
physician
to
a
consultation
how
is
this
to
be
kept
if
the
railway
uses
one
time
and
every
other
act
of
life
another
there
is
one
chain
of
circumstances
which
is
almost
peculiar
that
of
the
line

i
would
have
two

at

station
those
on

north
side
all
shewing
san
francisco
time
and
those
on
the
south
all
shewing
new
york
time
every
traveller
watch
would
then
be
available
to
the
end
of
his
journey
a
system
fundamentally
such
as
i
have
sketched
would
give
little
trouble
and
may
i
think
be
adopted
with
advantage
i

edward
he
returned
from
playford
on
his
other
movements
during
the
year
were
as
follows
from
apr
to
may
he
was
at
playford
and
again
from
august
to
from
to
he
was
travelling
with
his
two
unmarried
daughters
in
the
lake
district
of
cumberland
the
journey
was
by
furness
and
coniston
to
portinscale
near
keswick
on
he
fell
and
sprained
his
ankle
and
his
excursions
for
the
rest
of
the
time
were
mainly
conducted
by
driving
shortly
after
his
return
on
while
walking
alone
on
blackheath
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
attack
of
illness
and
lay
helpless
for
some
time
before
he
was
found
and
brought
home
he
seems
however
to
have
recovered
to
a
great
extent
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
and
continued
his
lunar
theory
and
other
work
as
before
on
june
he
made
the
following
sad
note
this
morning
died
after
a
most
painful
illness
my
anna

daughter
of

of
göttingen
wife
of
my
eldest
son
wilfrid
in
february
he
wrote
out
his
reminiscences
of
the
village
of
playford
during
his
boyhood
in
june
he
was
much
disturbed
in
mind
on
hearing
of
some
important
alterations
made
by
the
astronomer
royal
in
the
collimators
of
the
transit
circle
and
some
correspondence
ensued
on
the
during
the
year
he
had
much
correspondence
on
the
subject
of
the
subsidences
on
blackheath
the
following
letter
was
written
in
reply
to
a
gentleman
who
had
asked
whether
it
could
be
ascertained
by
calculation
how
long
it
is
since
the
glacial
period
existed
july
sir
i
should
have
much
pleasure
in
fully
answering
your
questions
of
july
if
i
were
able
to
do
so
but
the
subject
really
is
very
obscure
though
it
is
recognized
that
the
glacial
period
or
periods
is
late
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
has
ventured
to
fix
upon
a
rude
number
of
years
since
elapsed
we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
mean
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
has
sensibly
altered
there
have
been
changes
in
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
making
the
earth
distance
from
the
sun
less
in
one
month
and
greater
in
the
opposite
month
but
i
do
not
perceive
that
this
would
explain
glaciers
i
consider
it
to
be
certain
that
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
at
a
very
distant
period
was
very
hot
that
it
has
cooled
gradually
and
theoretically
and
imperceptibly
is
cooling
still
the
glaciers
must
be
later
than
these
hot
times
and
later
than
our
last
consolidated
strata
but
this
is
nearly
all
that
i
can
say

accepted

published
in

newspapers
a
statement
in
opposition
to
the
proposed
braithwaite

railway
which
he
considered
would
be
injurious
to
the
lake
district
in
which
he
took
so
deep
an
in

communicated
to

a
statement

stone

president
of
the

theory
on

subject
to
which
airy
had
given
his
incessant
attention

so
many
years

naturally
receive

careful
attention

opinion

letter
he
stated
the
principles
which
guided
him
as
follows
i
have
always
maintained
that
the
award
of
the
medal
ought
to
be
guided
mainly
by
the
originality
of
communications
that
one
advance
in
a
new
direction
ought
in
our
decision
to
outweigh
any
mass
of
work
in
a
routine
already
established
and
that
in
any
case
scientific
utility
as
distinguished
from
mere
elegance

indispensable

were
invented
as
proofs
by
ratios
and
that
they
were
then
violently
expanded
into
cumbrous
geometrical
proofs
on
june
he
declined
to
sign
a
memorial
asking
for
the
interment
of
mr
spottiswoode
in
westminster
abbey
stating
as
his
reason
i
take
it
that
interment
possessing
such
a
public
character
is
a
public
recognition
of
benefits
political
literary
or
philosophical
whose
effects
will
be
great
and
durable
now
i
doubt
whether
it
can
be
stated
that
mr
spottiswoode
had
conferred
such
benefits
on
society
but
he
adds
at
length
his
cordial
recognition
of
mr
spottiswoode
scientific
throughout
his
life
airy
was
a
regular
attendant
at
church
and
took
much
interest
in
the
conduct
of
the
church
services
in
october
of
this
year
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
vicar
of
greenwich
on
various
points
in
which
occurs
the
following
paragraph
but
there
is
one
matter
in
the
present
form
of
the
church
service
on
which
my
feeling
is
very
strong
namely
the
i
believe
choral
service
in
the
confession
the
prayer
and
the
creed
i
have
long
listened
with
veneration
to
our
noble
liturgy
and
i
have
always
been
struck
with
the
deep
personally
religious
feeling
which
pervades
it
especially
those
parts
of
it
which
are
for
people
and
an
earnest
priest
earnestly
pressing
these
parts
by
his
vocal
example
on
the
notice
of
the
people
can
scarcely
fail
to
excite
a
corresponding
earnestness
in
them
all
this
is
totally
lost
in
the
choral
system
for
a
venerable
persuasion
there
is
substituted
a
rude
irreverential
confusion
of
voices
for
an
earnest
acceptance
of
the
form
offered
by
the
priest
there
is
substituted
in
my
feeling
at
least
a
weary
waiting
for
the
end
of
an
unmeaning
form
he
also
objected
much
to
singing
the
responses
to
the
commandments
from
apr
to
may
he
was
at
playford
concluding
his
journal
there
with
the
note
so
ends
a
pleasant
vacation
on
june
he
went
to
cambridge
and
attended
the
trinity
college
commemoration
service
and
dined
in
from
to
he
was
at
on
he
made
an
expedition
to
guildford
and
during
this
year
he
was
closely
engaged
on
the
numerical
lunar
theory
and
for
relaxation
was
reading
theology
and
sundry
books
of
the
old
testament
on
june
he
attended
at
the
visitation
of
the
royal
in
a
letter
written
in
april
to
marindin
on
the
subject
of
wind
pressure
there
occurs
the
following
remark
when
the
heavy
gusts
come
on
the
wind
is
blowing
in
directions
changing
rapidly
but
limited
in
extent
my
conclusion
is
that
in
arches
of
small
extent
as
in
the
tay
bridge
every
thing
must
be
calculated
for
full
pressure
but
in
arches
of
large
extent
as
in
the
forth
bridge
every
thing
may
be
calculated
for
small
pressure
and
for
a
suspension
bridge
the
pressure
is
far
less
dangerous
than
for
a
stiff
arch
in
january
he
had
some
correspondence
with
professor
tyndall
on
the
theory
of
the
white
rainbow
and
stated
that
he
thoroughly
agreed
with
dr
young
explanation
of
this
phaenomenon
the
following
is
extracted
from
a
letter
on
may
to
his
old
friend
otto
struve
i
received
from
you
about
or
weeks
past
a
sign
of
your
friendly
remembrance
a
copy
of
your
paper
on
the
annual
parallax
of
aldebaran
it
pleased
me
much
especially
i
was
delighted
with
your
noble
retention
of
the
one
equation
whose
result
differed
so
sensibly
from
that
of
the
other
equations
it
is
quite
possible
even
probable
that
the
mean
result
is
improved
by
it
i
have
known
such
instances
the
first
which
attracted
much
attention
was
capt
kater
attempt
to
establish
a
scale
of
longitude
in
england
by
reciprocal
observations
of
azimuth
between
beachy
head
and
dunnose
the
result
was
evidently
erroneous
but
colonel
colby
on
examination
of
the
original
papers
found
that
some
observations
had
been
omitted
as
suspicious
and
that
when
these
were
included
the
mean
agreed
well
with
the
scale
of
observation
inferred
from
other
methods
in
a
letter
to
the
rev
rouse
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
a
geometrical
book
there
occurs
the
following
paragraph
i
do
not
value
euclid
elements
as
a
book
of
instruction
though
some
important
points
are
better
presented
in
it
than
in
any
other
book
of
geometrical
instruction
that
i
have
seen
but
i
value
it
as
a
book
of
strong
and
distinct
reasoning
and
of
orderly
succession
of
reasonings
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
book
in
the
world
which
presents
so
distinctly
the
therefore
and
this
is
invaluable
for
the
mental
education
of
youth
in
may
he
was
in
correspondence
with
professor
balfour
stewart
regarding
a
projected
movement
in
terrestrial
magnetism
to
be
submitted
to
the
british
association
airy
cordially
approved
of
this
movement
and
supported
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
stating
that
in
his
opinion
what
was
mainly
wanted
was
the
collation
of
existing
in
january
and
february
he
was
much
pressed
by
pritchard
of
oxford
to
give
his
opinion
as
to
the
incorrectness
of
statements
made
by
dr
kinns
in
his
lectures
on
the
scientific
accuracy
of
the
bible
airy
refused
absolutely
to
take
part
in
the
controversy
but
he
could
not
escape
from
the
correspondence
which
the
matter
involved
and
this
led
up
to
other
points
connected
with
the
early
history
of
the
israelites
a
subject
in
which
he
took
much
interest
from
may
to
june
he
was
at
from
july
to
he
was
in
the
lake
district
the
journey
was
by
windermere
to
kentmere
where
he
made
enquiries
concerning
the
airy
family
as
it
had
been
concluded
with
much
probability
from
investigations
made
by
his
nephew
the
rev
basil
airy
that
the
family
was
settled
there
at
a
very
early
date
some
persons
of
the
name
of
airy
were
still
living
there
he
then
went
on
by
coniston
and
grasmere
to
portinscale
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
time
in
expeditions
amongst
the
hills
and
visits
to
on
july
he
went
to
woodbridge
in
suffolk
and
distributed
the
prizes
to
the
boys
of
the
grammar
school
from
to
he
was
again
at
throughout
the
year
he
was
busily
engaged
on
the
numerical
lunar
theory
and
found
but
little
time
for
miscellaneous
reading
of
printed
papers
by
airy
in
this
year
the
most
important
was
one
on
the
results
deduced
from
the
measures
of
terrestrial
magnetic
force
in
the
horizontal
plane
this
was
a
long
paper
communicated
to
the
royal
society
and
published
in
the
phil
and
was
the
last
scientific
paper
of
any
importance
except
the
volume
of
the
numerical
lunar
theory
in
the
long
list
of
papers
by
airy
the
preparation
of
this
paper
took
much
of
miscellaneous
matters
in
may
a
committee
of
the
royal
society
had
been
appointed
to
advise
the
india
office
as
to
the
publication
of
herschel
pendulum
observations
in
india
and
airy
was
asked
to
assist
the
committee
with
his
advice
he
gave
very
careful
and
anxious
consideration
to
the
subject
and
it
occupied
much
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
he
was
asked
by
sir
william
thomson
to
assist
him
with
an
affidavit
in
a
lawsuit
concerning
an
alleged
infringement
of
one
of
his
patents
for
the
improvement
of
the
compass
airy
declined
to
make
an
affidavit
or
to
take
sides
in
the
dispute
but
he
wrote
a
letter
from
which
the
following
is
extracted
i
can
not
have
the
least
difficulty
in
expressing
my
opinion
that
you
have
made
a
great
advance
in
the
application
of
my
method
of
correcting
the
compass
in
iron
ships
by
your
introduction
of
the
use
of
short
needles
for
the
in
my
original
investigations
when
the
whole
subject
was
in
darkness
i
could
only
use
existing
means
for
experiment
namely
the
compasses
then
existing
but
when
i
applied
mechanical
theory
to
explanation
of
the
results
i
felt
grievously
the
deficiency
of
a
theory
and
the
construction
which
it
suggested
necessarily
founded
on
assumption
that
the
proportion
of
the
to
the
other
elements
of
measure
is
small
when
the
length
of
the
needles
was
really
so
great
i
should
possibly
have
used
some
construction
like
yours
but
the
government
had
not
then
a
single
iron
vessel
and
did
not
seem
disposed
to
urge
the
enquiry
you
under
happier
auspices
have
successfully
carried
it
out
and
i
fully
believe
with
much
advantage
to
the
science
he
wrote
a
paper
for
the
athenaeum
and
had
various
correspondence
on
the
subject
of
the
badbury
rings
in
dorsetshire
which
he
and
others
considered
as
identical
with
the
mons
badonicus
of
gildas
the
site
of
an
ancient
british
in
february
he
was
in
correspondence
with
the
astronomer
royal
on
uniform
time
reckoning
and
on
considerations
relating
to
on
june
he
attended
the
annual
visitation
of
the
observatory
and
brought
before
the
board
his
investigations
of
the
diurnal
magnetic
inequalities
and
the
revises
of
his
lunar
theory
from
june
to
july
he
was
at
and
again
at
playford
from
to
nov
on
march
he
had
an
attack
of
gout
in
his
right
foot
which
continued
through
april
and
into
may
causing
him
much
he
was
busy
with
the
numerical
lunar
theory
up
to
when
he
was
reading
the
last
received
from
the
printers
during
this
period
his
powers
were
evidently
failing
and
there
are
frequent
references
to
errors
discovered
and
corrected
and
to
uncertainties
connected
with
points
of
the
theory
but
his
great
work
on
the
numerical
lunar
theory
was
printed
in
this
year
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
experienced
a
great
feeling
of
relief
when
this
was
he
was
in
correspondence
with
adams
as
to
the
effect
of
his
reduction
of
the
coefficient
of
lunar
acceleration
on
the
calculation
of
the
ancient
historical
he
compiled
a
paper
on
the
establishment
of
the
roman
dominion
in
england
which
was
printed
in
he
wrote
a
notice
concerning
events
in
the
life
of
mr
john
jackson
of
rosthwaite
near
keswick
a
guide
and
authority
on
matters
relating
to
the
lake
he
also
wrote
a
short
account
of
the
connection
of
the
history
of
mdlle
de
quéroualle
with
that
of
the
royal
observatory
at
on
june
he
attended
at
the
annual
visitation
of
the
observatory
on
may
to
he
made
a
short
visit
to
eastbourne
and
the
from
june
to
july
he
was
at
from
to
he
was
travelling
in
dorsetshire
and
wiltshire
he
went
first
to
weymouth
a
very
favourite
centre
for
excursions
with
him
and
afterwards
visited
bridport
and
lyme
regis
then
by
dorchester
to
blandford
and
visited
the
hod
hill
badbury
rings
at
wimborne
he
was
much
interested
in
the
architecture
of
the
church
lastly
he
visited
salisbury
old
sarum
stonehenge
and
returned
to
from
to
he
was
at
during
this
year
he
partly
occupied
himself
with
arranging
his
papers
and
drawings
and
with
miscellaneous
reading
but
he
could
not
withdraw
his
thoughts
from
his
lunar
theory
and
he
still
continued
to
struggle
with
the
difficulties
of
the
subject
and
was
constantly
scheming
improvements
his
private
accounts
also
now
gave
him
much
trouble
throughout
his
life
he
had
been
accustomed
to
keep
his
accounts
by
double
entry
in
very
perfect
order
but
he
now
began
to
make
mistakes
and
to
grow
confused
and
this
distressed
him
greatly
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
him
to
abandon
his
elaborate
system
of
accounts
and
to
content
himself
with
simple
entries
of
receipts
and
expenses
this
would
have
been
utterly
opposed
to
his
sense
of
order
which
was
now
more
than
ever
the
ruling
principle
of
his
mind
and
so
he
struggled
with
his
accounts
as
he
did
with
his
lunar
theory
till
his
powers
absolutely
failed
in
his
journal
for
this
year
there
are
various
entries
of
mental
attacks
of
short
duration
and
other
ailments
ascribable
to
his
advanced
age
the
last
printed
papers
by
airy
belong
to
this
year
one
was
the
paper
before
referred
to
on
the
establishment
of
the
roman
dominion
in
england
another
was
on
the
solution
of
a
certain
equation
and
there
were
early
reminiscences
of
the
cambridge
tripos
in
february
he
attended
a
little
to
a
new
edition
of
his
ipswich
lectures
but
soon
handed
it
over
to
mr
turner
of
the
royal
on
may
he
was
drawing
up
suggestions
for
the
arrangement
of
the
seckford
school
at
on
june
he
attended
the
visitation
of
the
royal
observatory
when
a
resolution
was
passed
in
favour
of
complete
photography
of
the
from
the
to
of
may
he
made
a
short
expedition
to
bournemouth
and
stopped
on
the
way
home
to
visit
winchester
from
june
to
he
was
at
playford
and
again
from
to
nov
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
he
continued
his
examination
of
his
lunar
theory
but
gradually
dropped
it
there
are
several
references
in
his
journal
to
his
feelings
of
pain
and
weakness
both
mental
and
bodily
at
the
end
of
march
he
had
an
attack
of
gout
in
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
during
the
latter
part
of
the
year
he
was
troubled
with
his
private
accounts
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
been
engaged
on
any
miscellaneous
matters
calling
for
special
notice
in
this
year
but
he
kept
up
his
astronomical
correspondence
with
lockyer
on
the
meteorite
system
of
planetary
formation
with
pritchard
on
the
work
of
the
oxford
university
observatory
with
adams
on
his
numerical
lunar
theory
and
with
on
june
he
attended
the
visitation
of
the
royal
he
amused
himself
occasionally
with
reading
his
favourite
subjects
of
history
and
antiquities
and
with
looking
over
some
of
his
early
investigations
of
scientific
questions
on
june
he
made
a
excursion
to
from
july
to
he
was
in
the
cumberland
lake
district
chiefly
at
portinscale
near
keswick
while
staying
at
portinscale
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
giddiness
and
fell
upon
the
floor
he
afterwards
wrote
a
curious
account
of
the
visions
which
oppressed
his
brain
immediately
after
the
accident
he
returned
by
solihull
where
his
son
osmund
was
from
to
he
was
at
playford
while
there
he
drew
up
a
short
statement
of
his
general
state
of
health
adverting
particularly
to
the
loss
of
strength
in
his
legs
and
failure
of
his
walking
his
health
seems
to
have
failed
a
good
deal
in
this
year
on
he
had
an
accidental
fall
and
there
are
several
entries
in
his
journal
of
mental
attacks
pains
in
his
limbs
affection
of
his
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
he
was
much
engaged
on
the
history
of
the
airy
family
particularly
on
that
of
his
in
this
year
the
white
house
was
sold
by
auction
by
its
owners
and
airy
purchased
it
on
may
he
was
still
in
difficulties
with
his
private
accounts
but
was
making
efforts
to
abandon
his
old
and
elaborate
for
his
amusement
he
was
chiefly
engaged
on
theological
notes
which
he
was
compiling
and
also
on
early
optical
investigations
on
june
he
attended
the
visitation
of
the
royal
observatory
and
moved
a
resolution
that
a
committee
be
appointed
to
consider
whether
any
reduction
can
be
effected
in
the
amount
of
matter
printed
in
the
volume
of
observations
of
the
royal
observatory
during
his
tenure
of
office
he
had
on
various
occasions
brought
this
subject
before
the
board
of
visitors
and
with
his
usual
tenacity
of
purpose
he
now
as
visitor
pressed
it
upon
their
in
may
he
zealously
joined
with
others
in
an
application
to
get
for
dr
huggins
a
pension
on
the
civil
in
january
he
prepared
a
short
paper
illustrated
with
diagrams
to
exhibit
the
interference
of
solar
light
as
used
by
him
in
his
lectures
at
cambridge
in
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
in
april
he
received
a
copy
of
a
paper
by
mr
rundell
referring
to
the
complete
adoption
of
his
system
of
compass
correction
in
iron
ships
not
only
in
the
merchant
service
but
also
in
the
navy
this
was
a
matter
of
peculiar
gratification
to
airy
who
had
always
maintained
that
the
method
of
tables
of
errors
which
had
been
so
persistently
adhered
to
by
the
admiralty
was
a
mistake
and
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
find
it
necessary
to
adopt
his
method
of
mechanical
correction
the
passage
referred
to
is
as
follows
the
name
of
sir
george
airy
the
father
of
the
mechanical
compensation
of
the
compass
in
iron
vessels
having
just
been
mentioned
it
may
not
be
inappropriate
to
remind
you
that
the
present
year
is
the
fiftieth
since
sir
george
airy
presented
to
the
royal
society
his
celebrated
paper
on
this
subject
with
the
account
of
his
experiments
on
the
and
fifty
years
is
a
long
period
in
one
history
and
sir
george
airy
may
well
be
proud
in
looking
back
over
this
period
to
see
how
complete
has
been
the
success
of
his
compass
investigation
his
mode
of
compensation
has
been
adopted
by
all
the
civilized
world
sir
william
thomson
one
of
the
latest
and
perhaps
the
most
successful
of
modern
compass
adjusters
when
he
exhibited
his
apparatus
in
before
a
distinguished
meeting
in
london
remarked
that
within
the
last
ten
years
the
application
of
sir
george
method
had
become
universal
not
only
in
the
merchant
service
but
in
the
navies
of
this
and
other
countries
and
added
the
compass
and
the
binnacles
before
you
are
designed
to
thoroughly
carry
out
in
practical
navigation
the
astronomer
royal
principles
from
may
to
he
was
on
an
expedition
to
north
wales
stopping
at
chester
conway
carnarvon
barmouth
and
from
june
to
july
he
was
at
playford
and
again
from
to
nov
in
this
year
his
powers
greatly
failed
and
he
complained
frequently
of
mental
attacks
weakness
of
limbs
lassitude
and
failure
of
sleep
he
occupied
himself
as
usual
with
his
books
papers
and
accounts
and
read
travels
biblical
history
but
nothing
very
persistently
on
june
he
attended
the
visitation
of
the
royal
from
a
letter
addressed
to
him
by
mr
hartnup
of
liverpool
observatory
it
appears
that
there
had
grown
up
in
the
mercantile
world
an
impression
that
very
accurate
chronometers
were
not
needed
for
steam
ships
because
they
were
rarely
running
many
days
out
of
sight
of
land
and
airy
opinion
was
requested
on
this
matter
he
replied
as
follows
on
mar
the
question
proposed
in
your
letter
is
purely
a
practical
one
if
a
ship
is
ever
to
be
two
days
out
of
sight
of
land
i
think
that
she
ought
to
be
furnished
with
two
chronometers
properly
tested
for
the
proper
testing
of
the
rates
of
the
chronometers
a
rating
of
the
chronometers
for
three
or
four
days
in
a
meridional
observatory
is
necessary
a
longer
testing
is
desirable
in
march
he
was
in
correspondence
as
one
of
the
trustees
of
the
sheepshanks
fund
with
the
master
of
trinity
relative
to
grants
from
the
fund
for
cambridge
observatory
from
june
to
july
he
was
at
playford
and
again
from
to
his
last
visit
throughout
the
year
his
weakness
both
of
brain
power
and
muscular
power
had
been
gradually
increasing
and
during
this
stay
at
playford
on
he
fell
down
in
his
probably
from
failure
of
nerve
action
and
was
much
prostrated
by
the
shock
for
several
days
he
remained
in
a
condition
and
although
he
rallied
yet
he
continued
very
weak
and
it
was
not
until
that
he
could
be
removed
to
the
white
house
up
to
the
time
of
his
fall
he
had
been
able
to
take
frequent
drives
and
even
short
walks
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
was
so
fond
of
but
he
could
take
but
little
exercise
afterwards
and
on
or
about
he
made
the
following
note
the
saddest
expedition
that
i
have
ever
made
we
have
not
left
home
for
several
days
the
rapid
failure
of
his
powers
during
this
year
is
well
exemplified
by
his
handwriting
in
his
journal
entries
which
with
occasional
rallies
becomes
broken
and
in
places
almost
illegible
he
makes
frequent
reference
to
his
decline
in
strength
and
and
to
his
failing
memory
but
he
continued
his
ordinary
occupations
made
frequent
drives
around
blackheath
and
amused
himself
with
his
family
history
researches
arrangement
of
papers
and
miscellaneous
reading
and
he
persisted
to
the
last
with
his
private
accounts
his
interest
in
matters
around
him
was
still
keen
on
june
he
was
driving
along
the
greenwich
marshes
in
order
to
track
the
course
of
the
great
sewer
and
on
august
he
visited
the
crossness
sewage
works
and
took
great
interest
in
the
details
of
the
treatment
of
the
in
march
he
contributed
with
great
satisfaction
to
the
fund
for
the
portrait
of
his
old
friend
sir
stokes
with
whom
he
had
had
so
much
scientific
on
july
an
afternoon
party
was
arranged
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
his
birthday
the
actual
anniversary
was
on
july
none
of
his
early
friends
were
there
he
had
survived
them
all
but
invitations
were
sent
to
all
his
scientific
and
private
friends
who
could
be
expected
to
come
and
a
large
party
assembled
the
afternoon
was
very
fine
and
he
sat
in
the
garden
and
received
his
friends
many
of
whom
had
come
from
long
distances
in
good
strength
and
spirits
it
was
a
most
successful
gathering
and
was
not
without
its
meaning
for
it
was
felt
that
under
the
circumstances
of
his
failing
powers
it
was
in
all
probability
a
final
on
july
he
went
down
to
the
greenwich
parish
church
at
to
be
present
at
the
illumination
of
the
church
clock
face
for
the
first
time
a
matter
of
local
interest
which
had
necessitated
a
good
deal
of
time
and
money
on
this
occasion
at
the
request
of
the
company
assembled
in
and
around
the
vestry
he
spoke
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
time
the
value
of
accurate
time
the
dissemination
of
greenwich
time
throughout
the
country
by
from
the
observatory
and
the
exhibition
of
it
by
the
subject
to
which
so
large
a
part
of
his
life
had
been
devoted
it
was
a
pleasant
and
able
speech
and
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
parishioners
amongst
whom
he
had
lived
for
so
many
he
received
two
illuminated
addresses
one
from
the
astronomer
royal
and
staff
of
the
royal
observatory
the
other
from
the
vorstand
of
the
astronomische
gesellschaft
at
berlin
and
various
private
letters
of
congratulation
the
address
from
the
staff
of
the
observatory
was
worded
thus
we
the
present
members
of
the
staff
of
the
royal
observatory
greenwich
beg
to
offer
you
our
most
sincere
congratulations
on
the
occasion
of
your
birthday
we
can
not
but
feel
how
closely
associated
we
are
with
you
in
that
our
whole
energies
are
directed
to
the
maintenance
and
development
of
that
practical
astronomical
work
of
which
you
essentially
laid
the
foundation
it
affords
us
great
pleasure
to
think
that
after
the
conclusion
of
your
life
work
you
have
been
spared
to
live
so
long
under
the
shadow
of
the
noble
observatory
with
which
your
name
was
identified
for
half
a
century
and
with
which
it
must
ever
remain
associated
after
his
return
from
playford
he
seemed
to
rally
a
little
but
he
soon
fell
ill
and
was
found
to
be
suffering
from
hernia
this
necessitated
a
surgical
operation
which
was
successfully
performed
on
this
gave
him
effectual
relief
and
after
recovering
from
the
immediate
effects
of
the
operation
he
lay
for
several
days
quietly
and
without
active
pain
reciting
the
english
poetry
with
which
his
memory
was
stored
but
the
shock
was
too
great
for
his
enfeebled
condition
and
he
died
peacefully
in
the
presence
of
his
six
surviving
children
on
he
was
buried
in
playford
churchyard
on
the
funeral
procession
was
attended
at
greenwich
by
the
whole
staff
of
the
royal
observatory
and
by
other
friends
and
at
his
burial
there
were
present
two
former
fellows
of
the
college
to
which
he
had
been
so
deeply
attached

with
the
instinct
of
order
which
formed
one
of
his
chief
characteristics
airy
carefully
preserved
a
copy
of
every
printed
paper
of
his
own
composition
these
were
regularly
bound
in
large
quarto
volumes
and
they
are
in
themselves
a
striking
proof
of
his
wonderful
diligence
the
bound
volumes
are
in
number
and
they
occupy
a
space
of
in
on
a
shelf
they
contain
papers
a
list
of
which
is
appended
and
they
form
such
an
important
part
of
his
life
work
that
his
biography
would
be
very
incomplete
without
a
reference
to
them
he
was
very
careful
in
selecting
the
channels
for
the
publication
of
his
papers
most
of
the
early
papers
were
published
in
the
transactions
of
the
cambridge
philosophical
society
but
several
of
the
most
important
such
as
his
paper
on
an
inequality
of
long
period
in
the
motions
of
the
earth
and
venus
were
published
in
the
philosophical
transactions
of
the
royal
society
and
others
such
as
the
articles
on
the
figure
of
the
earth
gravitation
tides
and
waves
were
published
in
encyclopaedias
after
his
removal
to
greenwich
nearly
all
his
papers
on
scientific
subjects
except
astronomy
such
as
tides
magnetism
correction
of
the
compass
were
communicated
to
the
royal
society
and
were
published
in
the
philosophical
transactions
but
everything
astronomical
was
reserved
for
the
royal
astronomical
society
his
connection
with
that
society
was
very
close
he
had
joined
it
in
its
earliest
days
the
date
of
his
election
was
may
and
regarded
it
as
the
proper
medium
for
the
discussion
of
current
astronomical
questions
and
for
recording
astronomical
progress
he
was
unremitting
in
his
attendance
at
the
monthly
meetings
of
the
society
and
was
several
times
president
in
the
memoirs
of
the
society
of
his
papers
are
printed
and
in
addition
papers
in
the
monthly
notices
in
fact
a
meeting
of
the
society
rarely
passed
without
some
communication
from
him
and
such
was
his
wealth
of
matter
that
sometimes
he
would
communicate
as
many
as
papers
on
a
single
evening
for
the
publication
of
several
short
mathematical
papers
and
especially
for
correspondence
on
disputed
points
of
mathematical
investigation
he
chose
as
his
vehicle
the
philosophical
magazine
to
which
he
contributed
papers
investigations
of
a
more
popular
character
he
published
in
the
athenaeum
which
he
also
used
as
a
vehicle
for
his
replies
to
attacks
on
his
work
or
on
the
establishment
which
he
conducted
in
all
he
made
communications
to
that
newspaper
to
various
societies
such
as
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
the
british
association
the
royal
institution
he
presented
papers
or
made
communications
on
subjects
specially
suited
to
each
and
in
like
manner
to
various
newspapers
there
were
papers
in
this
category
in
so
long
an
official
life
there
would
naturally
be
a
great
number
of
official
reports
parliamentary
returns
and
these
with
other
miscellaneous
papers
printed
for
particular
objects
and
for
a
limited
circulation
amounted
in
all
to
under
this
head
come
his
annual
reports
to
the
board
of
visitors
which
in
themselves
contain
an
extremely
full
and
accurate
history
of
the
observatory
during
his
tenure
of
office
there
are
of
these
reports
and
they
would
of
themselves
form
a
