the
story
of
evolution
by
joseph
mccabe
preface
an
ingenious
student
of
science
once
entertained
his
generation
with
a
theory
of
how
one
might
behold
again
all
the
stirring
chapters
that
make
up
the
story
of
the
earth
the
living
scene
of
our
time
is
lit
by
the
light
of
the
sun
and
for
every
few
rays
that
enter
the
human
eye
and
convey
the
image
of
it
to
the
human
mind
great
floods
of
the
reflected
light
pour
out
swiftly
and
indefinitely
into
space
imagine
then
a
man
moving
out
into
space
more
rapidly
than
light
his
face
turned
toward
the
earth
flashing
through
the
void
at
let
us
say
a
million
miles
a
second
he
would
if
we
can
overlook
the
dispersion
of
the
rays
of
light
overtake
in
succession
the
light
that
fell
on
the
french
revolution
the
reformation
the
norman
conquest
and
the
faces
of
the
ancient
empires
he
would
read
in
reverse
order
the
living
history
of
man
and
whatever
lay
before
the
coming
of
man
few
thought
as
they
smiled
over
this
fairy
tale
of
science
that
some
such
panoramic
survey
of
the
story
of
the
earth
and
even
of
the
heavens
might
one
day
be
made
in
a
leisure
hour
by
ordinary
mortals
that
in
the
soil
on
which
they
trod
were
surer
records
of
the
past
than
in
its
doubtful
literary
remains
and
in
the
deeper
rocks
were
records
that
dimly
lit
a
vast
abyss
of
time
of
which
they
never
dreamed
it
is
the
supreme
achievement
of
modern
science
to
have
discovered
and
deciphered
these
records
the
picture
of
the
past
which
they
afford
is
on
the
whole
an
outline
sketch
here
and
there
the
details
the
colour
the
light
and
shade
may
be
added
but
the
greater
part
of
the
canvas
is
left
to
the
more
skilful
hand
of
a
future
generation
and
even
the
broad
lines
are
at
times
uncertain
yet
each
age
would
know
how
far
its
scientific
men
have
advanced
in
constructing
that
picture
of
the
growth
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
the
aim
of
the
present
volume
is
to
give
in
clear
and
plain
language
as
full
an
account
of
the
story
as
the
present
condition
of
our
knowledge
and
the
limits
of
the
volume
will
allow
the
author
has
been
for
many
years
interested
in
the
evolution
of
things
or
the
way
in
which
suns
and
atoms
fishes
and
flowers
hills
and
elephants
even
man
and
his
institutions
came
to
be
what
they
are
lecturing
and
writing
on
one
or
other
phase
of
the
subject
have
moreover
taught
him
a
language
which
the
inexpert
seem
to
understand
although
he
is
not
content
merely
to
give
a
superficial
description
of
the
past
inhabitants
of
the
earth
the
particular
features
which
it
is
hoped
may
give
the
book
a
distinctive
place
in
the
large
literature
of
evolution
are
first
that
it
includes
the
many
evolutionary
discoveries
of
the
last
few
years
gathers
its
material
from
the
score
of
sciences
which
confine
themselves
to
separate
aspects
of
the
universe
and
blends
all
these
facts
and
discoveries
in
a
more
or
less
continuous
chronicle
of
the
life
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
then
the
author
has
endeavoured
to
show
not
merely
how
but
why
scene
succeeds
scene
in
the
chronicle
of
the
earth
and
life
slowly
climbs
from
level
to
level
he
has
taken
nature
in
the
past
as
we
find
it
an
interconnected
whole
in
which
the
changes
of
land
and
sea
of
heat
and
cold
of
swamp
and
hill
are
faithfully
reflected
in
the
forms
of
its
living
population
and
finally
he
has
written
for
those
who
are
not
students
of
science
or
whose
knowledge
may
be
confined
to
one
branch
of
science
and
used
a
plain
speech
which
assumes
no
previous
knowledge
on
the
reader
part
for
the
rest
it
will
be
found
that
no
strained
effort
is
made
to
trace
pedigrees
of
animals
and
plants
when
the
material
is
scanty
that
if
on
account
of
some
especial
interest
disputable
or
conjectural
speculations
are
admitted
they
are
frankly
described
as
such
and
that
the
more
important
differences
of
opinion
which
actually
divide
astronomers
geologists
biologists
and
anthropologists
are
carefully
taken
into
account
and
briefly
explained
a
few
english
and
american
works
are
recommended
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
would
study
particular
chapters
more
closely
but
it
has
seemed
useless
in
such
a
work
to
give
a
bibliography
of
the
hundreds
of
english
american
french
german
and
italian

chapter
i
the
discovery
of
the
universe
the
beginning
of
the
victorious
career
of
modern
science
was
very
largely
due
to
the
making
of
two
stimulating
discoveries
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
one
was
the
discovery
of
the
earth
the
other
the
discovery
of
the
universe
men
were
confined
like
molluscs
in
their
shells
by
a
belief
that
they
occupied
the
centre
of
a
comparatively
small
disk
some
ventured
to
say
a
globe
which
was
poised
in
a
mysterious
way
in
the
middle
of
a
small
system
of
heavenly
bodies
the
general
feeling
was
that
these
heavenly
bodies
were
lamps
hung
on
a
not
too
remote
ceiling
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
their
ways
then
certain
enterprising
sailors
vasco
da
gama
maghalaes
columbus
brought
home
the
news
that
the
known
world
was
only
one
side
of
an
enormous
globe
and
that
there
were
vast
lands
and
great
peoples
thousands
of
miles
across
the
ocean
the
minds
of
men
in
europe
had
hardly
strained
their
shells
sufficiently
to
embrace
this
larger
earth
when
the
second
discovery
was
reported
the
roof
of
the
world
with
its
useful
little
system
of
heavenly
bodies
began
to
crack
and
disclose
a
profound
and
mysterious
universe
surrounding
them
on
every
side
one
can
not
understand
the
solidity
of
the
modern
doctrine
of
the
formation
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
until
one
appreciates
this
revolution
before
the
law
of
gravitation
had
been
discovered
it
was
almost
impossible
to
regard
the
universe
as
other
than
a
small
and
compact
system
we
shall
see
that
a
few
daring
minds
pierced
the
veil
and
peered
out
wonderingly
into
the
real
universe
beyond
but
for
the
great
mass
of
men
it
was
quite
impossible
to
them
the
modern
idea
of
a
universe
consisting
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
bodies
each
weighing
billions
of
tons
strewn
over
billions
of
miles
of
space
would
have
seemed
the
dream
of
a
child
or
a
savage
material
bodies
were
heavy
and
would
fall
down
if
they
were
not
supported
the
universe
they
said
was
a
sensible
scientific
structure
things
were
supported
in
their
respective
places
a
great
dome
of
some
unknown
but
compact
material
spanned
the
earth
and
sustained
the
heavenly
bodies
it
might
rest
on
the
distant
mountains
or
be
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
an
atlas
or
the
whole
cosmic
scheme
might
be
laid
on
the
back
of
a
gigantic
elephant
and
if
you
pressed
the
elephant
might
stand
on
the
hard
shell
of
a
tortoise
but
you
were
not
encouraged
to
press
the
idea
of
the
vault
had
come
from
babylon
the
first
home
of
science
no
furnaces
thickened
that
clear
atmosphere
and
the
priests
at
the
summit
of
each
of
the
temples
were
astronomers
night
by
night
for
thousands
of
years
they
watched
the
stars
and
planets
tracing
their
undeviating
paths
across
the
sky
to
explain
their
movements
the
invented
the
solid
firmament
beyond
the
known
land
encircling
it
was
the
sea
and
beyond
the
sea
was
a
range
of
high
mountains
forming
another
girdle
round
the
earth
on
these
mountains
the
dome
of
the
heavens
rested
much
as
the
dome
of
paul
rests
on
its
lofty
masonry
the
sun
travelled
across
its
by
day
and
went
back
to
the
east
during
the
night
through
a
tunnel
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
vault
to
the
common
folk
the
priests
explained
that
this
framework
of
the
world
was
the
body
of
an
ancient
and
disreputable
goddess
the
god
of
light
had
slit
her
in
two
as
you
do
a
dried
fish
they
said
and
made
the
plain
of
the
earth
with
one
half
and
the
blue
arch
of
the
heavens
with
the
other
so
chaldaea
lived
out
its
years
without
discovering
the
universe
egypt
adopted
the
idea
from
more
scientific
babylon
amongst
the
fragments
of
its
civilisation
we
find
representations
of
the
firmament
as
a
goddess
arching
over
the
earth
on
her
hands
and
feet
condemned
to
that
eternal
posture
by
some
victorious
god
the
idea
spread
amongst
the
smaller
nations
which
were
lit
by
the
civilisation
of
babylon
and
egypt
some
blended
it
with
coarse
old
legends
some
like
the
persians
and
hebrews
refined
it
the
persians
made
fire
a
purer
and
lighter
spirit
so
that
the
stars
would
need
no
support
but
everywhere
the
blue
vault
hemmed
in
the
world
and
the
ideas
of
men
it
was
so
close
some
said
that
the
birds
could
reach
it
at
last
the
genius
of
greece
brooded
over
the
whole
chaos
of
cosmical
speculations
the
native
tradition
of
greece
was
a
little
more
helpful
than
the
babylonian
teaching
first
was
chaos
then
the
heavier
matter
sank
to
the
bottom
forming
the
disk
of
the
earth
with
the
ocean
poured
round
it
and
the
less
coarse
matter
floated
as
an
atmosphere
above
it
and
the
still
finer
matter
formed
an
aether
above
the
atmosphere
a
remarkably
good
guess
in
its
very
broad
outline
but
the
solid
firmament
still
arched
the
earth
and
the
stars
were
little
undying
fires
in
the
vault
the
earth
itself
was
small
and
flat
it
stretched
on
the
modern
map
from
about
gibraltar
to
the
caspian
and
from
central
germany
where
the
entrance
to
the
lower
world
was
located
to
the
atlas
mountains
but
all
the
varied
and
conflicting
culture
of
the
older
empires
was
now
passing
into
greece
lighting
up
in
succession
the
civilisations
of
asia
minor
the
greek
islands
and
then
athens
and
its
sister
states
men
began
to
think
the
first
genius
to
have
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
seems
to
have
been
the
grave
and
mystical
pythagorus
born
about
he
taught
his
little
school
that
the
earth
was
a
globe
not
a
disk
and
that
it
turned
on
its
axis
in
hours
the
earth
and
the
other
planets
were
revolving
round
the
central
fire
of
the
system
but
the
sun
was
a
reflection
of
this
central
fire
not
the
fire
itself
even
pythagoras
moreover
made
the
heavens
a
solid
sphere
revolving
with
its
stars
round
the
central
fire
and
the
truth
he
discovered
was
mingled
with
so
much
mysticism
and
confined
to
so
small
and
retired
a
school
that
it
was
quickly
lost
again
in
the
next
generation
anaxagoras
taught
that
the
sun
was
a
vast
globe
of
iron
and
that
the
stars
were
material
bodies
made
by
friction
with
the
ether
a
generation
later
the
famous
democritus
came
nearer
than
any
to
the
truth
the
universe
was
composed
of
an
infinite
number
of
indestructible
particles
called
atoms
which
had
gradually
settled
from
a
state
of
chaotic
confusion
to
their
present
orderly
arrangement
in
large
masses
the
sun
was
a
body
of
enormous
size
and
the
points
of
light
in
the
milky
way
were
similar
suns
at
a
tremendous
distance
from
the
earth
our
universe
moreover
was
only
one
of
an
infinite
number
of
universes
and
an
eternal
cycle
of
destruction
and
was
running
through
these
myriads
of
worlds
by
sheer
speculation
greece
was
well
on
the
way
of
discovery
then
the
mists
of
philosophy
fell
between
the
mind
of
greece
and
nature
and
the
notions
of
democritus
were
rejected
with
disdain
and
then
very
speedily
the
decay
of
the
brilliant
nation
put
an
end
to
its
feverish
search
for
truth
greek
culture
passed
to
alexandria
where
it
met
the
remains
of
the
culture
of
egypt
babylonia
and
persia
and
one
more
remarkable
effort
was
made
to
penetrate
the
outlying
universe
before
the
night
of
the
middle
ages
fell
on
the
old
world
astronomy
was
ardently
studied
at
alexandria
and
was
fortunately
combined
with
an
assiduous
study
of
mathematics
aristarchus
about
calculated
that
the
sun
was
miles
away
a
vast
expansion
of
the
solar
system
and
for
the
time
a
remarkable
approach
to
the
real
figure
eratosthenes
made
an
extremely
good
calculation
of
the
size
of
the
earth
though
he
held
it
to
be
the
centre
of
a
small
universe
he
concluded
that
it
was
a
globe
measuring
instead
of
miles
in
circumference
posidonius
came
even
nearer
with
a
calculation
that
the
circumference
was
between
and
miles
and
he
made
a
fairly
correct
estimate
of
the
diameter
and
therefore
distance
of
the
sun
hipparchus
made
an
extremely
good
calculation
of
the
distance
of
the
moon
by
the
brilliant
work
of
the
alexandrian
astronomers
the
old
world
seemed
to
be
approaching
the
discovery
of
the
universe
men
were
beginning
to
think
in
millions
to
gaze
boldly
into
deep
abysses
of
space
to
talk
of
vast
fiery
globes
that
made
the
earth
insignificant
but
the
splendid
energy
gradually
failed
and
the
long
line
was
closed
by
ptolemaeus
who
once
more
put
the
earth
in
the
centre
of
the
system
and
so
imposed
what
is
called
the
ptolemaic
system
on
europe
the
keen
of
alexandria
still
ran
on
and
there
might
have
been
a
return
to
the
saner
early
doctrines
but
at
last
alexandrian
culture
was
extinguished
in
the
blood
of
the
aged
hypatia
and
the
night
fell
rome
had
had
no
genius
for
science
though
lucretius
gave
an
immortal
expression
to
the
views
of
democritus
and
epicurus
and
such
writers
as
cicero
and
pliny
did
great
service
to
a
later
age
in
preserving
fragments
of
the
older
discoveries
the
curtains
were
once
more
drawn
about
the
earth
the
glimpses
which
adventurous
greeks
had
obtained
of
the
great
outlying
universe
were
forgotten
for
a
thousand
years
the
earth
became
again
the
little
platform
in
the
centre
of
a
little
world
on
which
men
and
women
played
their
little
parts
preening
themselves
on
their
superiority
to
their
pagan
ancestors
i
do
not
propose
to
tell
the
familiar
story
of
the
revival
at
any
length
as
far
as
the
present
subject
is
concerned
it
was
literally
a
renascence
or
of
greek
ideas
constantinople
having
been
taken
by
the
turks
hundreds
of
greek
scholars
with
their
old
literature
sought
refuge
in
europe
and
the
vigorous
brain
of
the
young
nations
brooded
over
the
ancient
speculations
just
as
the
vigorous
young
brain
of
greece
had
done
two
thousand
years
before
copernicus
acknowledges
that
he
found
the
secret
of
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
in
the
speculations
of
the
old
greek
thinkers
galilei
enlarged
the
copernican
system
with
the
aid
of
the
telescope
and
the
telescope
was
an
outcome
of
the
new
study
of
optics
which
had
been
inspired
in
roger
bacon
and
other
medieval
scholars
by
the
optical
works
directly
founded
on
the
greek
of
the
spanish
moors
giordano
bruno
still
further
enlarged
the
system
he
pictured
the
universe
boldly
as
an
infinite
ocean
of
liquid
ether
in
which
the
stars
with
retinues
of
inhabited
planets
floated
majestically
bruno
was
burned
at
the
stake
but
the
curtains
that
had
so
long
been
drawn
about
the
earth
were
now
torn
aside
for
ever
and
men
looked
inquiringly
into
the
unfathomable
depths
beyond
descartes
revived
the
old
greek
idea
of
a
gradual
evolution
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
from
a
primitive
chaos
of
particles
taught
that
the
stars
stood
out
at
unimaginable
distances
in
the
ocean
of
ether
and
imagined
the
ether
as
stirring
in
gigantic
whirlpools
which
bore
cosmic
bodies
in
their
orbits
as
the
eddy
in
the
river
causes
the
cork
to
revolve
these
stimulating
conjectures
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
new
age
a
series
of
great
astronomers
had
meantime
been
patiently
and
scientifically
laying
the
foundations
of
our
knowledge
kepler
formulated
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
the
planets
newton
crowned
the
earlier
work
with
his
discovery
of
the
real
agency
that
sustains
cosmic
bodies
in
their
relative
positions
the
primitive
notion
of
a
material
frame
and
the
confining
dome
of
the
ancients
were
abandoned
we
know
now
that
a
framework
of
the
most
massive
steel
would
be
too
frail
to
hold
together
even
the
moon
and
the
earth
it
would
be
rent
by
the
strain
the
action
of
gravitation
is
the
power
once
introduce
that
idea
and
the
great
ocean
of
ether
might
stretch
illimitably
on
every
side
and
the
vastest
bodies
might
be
scattered
over
it
and
traverse
it
in
stupendous
paths
thus
it
came
about
that
as
the
little
optic
tube
of
galilei
slowly
developed
into
the
giant
telescope
of
herschel
and
then
into
the
powerful
refracting
telescopes
of
the
united
states
of
our
time
as
the
new
science
of
photography
provided
observers
with
a
new
eye
a
sensitive
plate
that
will
register
messages
which
the
human
eye
can
not
detect
from
regions
and
as
a
new
instrument
the
spectroscope
endowed
astronomers
with
a
power
of
perceiving
fresh
aspects
of
the
inhabitants
of
space
the
horizon
rolled
backward
and
the
mind
contemplated
a
universe
of
colossal
extent
and
power
let
us
try
to
conceive
this
universe
before
we
study
its
evolution
i
do
not
adopt
any
of
the
numerous
devices
that
have
been
invented
for
the
purpose
of
impressing
on
the
imagination
the
large
figures
we
must
use
one
may
doubt
if
any
of
them
are
effective
and
they
are
at
least
familiar
our
solar
system
the
family
of
sun
and
planets
which
had
been
sheltered
under
a
mighty
dome
resting
on
the
has
turned
out
to
occupy
a
span
of
space
some
miles
in
diameter
that
is
a
very
small
area
in
the
new
universe
draw
a
circle
billion
miles
in
diameter
round
the
sun
and
you
will
find
that
it
contains
only
three
stars
besides
the
sun
in
other
words
a
sphere
of
space
measuring
billion
miles
in
circumference
we
will
not
venture
upon
the
number
of
cubic
miles
contains
only
four
stars
the
sun
alpha
centauri
lalande
and
cygni
however
this
part
of
space
seems
to
be
below
the
average
in
point
of
population
and
we
must
adopt
a
different
way
of
estimating
the
magnitude
of
the
universe
from
the
number
of
its
stellar
citizens
beyond
the
vast
sphere
of
comparatively
empty
space
immediately
surrounding
our
sun
lies
the
stellar
universe
into
which
our
great
telescopes
are
steadily
penetrating
recent
astronomers
give
various
calculations
ranging
from
to
of
the
number
of
stars
that
have
yet
come
within
our
faintest
knowledge
let
us
accept
the
modest
provisional
estimate
of
now
if
we
had
reason
to
think
that
these
stars
were
of
much
the
same
size
and
brilliance
as
our
sun
we
should
be
able
roughly
to
calculate
their
distance
from
their
faintness
we
can
not
do
this
as
they
differ
considerably
in
size
and
intrinsic
brilliance
sirius
is
more
than
twice
the
size
of
our
sun
and
gives
out
twenty
times
as
much
light
canopus
emits
times
as
much
light
as
the
sun
but
we
can
not
say
in
this
case
how
much
larger
it
is
than
the
sun
arcturus
however
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
stars
as
our
sun
and
astronomers
conclude
that
it
must
be
thousands
of
times
larger
than
the
sun
a
few
stars
are
known
to
be
smaller
than
the
sun
some
are
intrinsically
far
more
brilliant
some
far
less
brilliant
another
method
has
been
adopted
though
this
also
must
be
regarded
with
great
reserve
the
distance
of
the
nearer
stars
can
be
positively
measured
and
this
has
been
done
in
a
large
number
of
cases
the
proportion
of
such
cases
to
the
whole
is
still
very
small
but
as
far
as
the
results
go
we
find
that
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
are
on
the
average
nearly
billion
miles
away
stars
of
the
second
magnitude
nearly
billion
and
stars
of
the
third
magnitude
billion
if
this
fifty
per
cent
increase
of
distance
for
each
lower
magnitude
of
stars
were
certain
and
constant
the
stars
of
the
eighth
magnitude
would
be
billion
miles
away
and
stars
of
the
sixteenth
magnitude
would
be
billion
miles
away
and
there
are
still
two
fainter
classes
of
stars
which
are
registered
on
photographs
the
mere
vastness
of
these
figures
is
immaterial
to
the
astronomer
but
he
warns
us
that
the
method
is
uncertain
we
may
be
content
to
conclude
that
the
starry
universe
over
which
our
great
telescopes
keep
watch
stretches
for
thousands
and
probably
tens
of
thousands
of
billions
of
miles
there
are
myriads
of
stars
so
remote
that
though
each
is
a
vast
incandescent
globe
at
a
temperature
of
many
thousand
degrees
and
though
their
light
is
concentrated
on
the
mirrors
or
in
the
lenses
of
our
largest
telescopes
and
directed
upon
the
photographic
plate
at
the
rate
of
more
than
billion
waves
a
second
they
take
several
hours
to
register
the
faintest
point
of
light
on
the
plate
when
we
reflect
that
the
universe
has
grown
with
the
growth
of
our
telescopes
and
the
application
of
photography
we
wonder
whether
we
may
as
yet
see
only
a
fraction
of
the
real
universe
as
small
in
comparison
with
the
whole
as
the
babylonian
system
was
in
comparison
with
ours
we
must
be
content
to
wonder
some
affirm
that
the
universe
is
infinite
others
that
it
is
limited
we
have
no
firm
ground
in
science
for
either
assertion
those
who
claim
that
the
system
is
limited
point
out
that
as
the
stars
decrease
in
brightness
they
increase
so
enormously
in
number
that
the
greater
faintness
is
more
than
compensated
and
therefore
if
there
were
an
infinite
series
of
magnitudes
the
midnight
sky
would
be
a
blaze
of
light
but
this
theoretical
reasoning
does
not
allow
for
dense
regions
of
space
that
may
obstruct
the
light
or
vast
regions
of
vacancy
between
vast
systems
of
stars
even
apart
from
the
evidence
that
dark
nebulae
or
other
special
regions
do
exist
the
question
is
under
discussion
in
science
at
the
present
moment
whether
light
is
not
absorbed
in
the
passage
through
ordinary
space
there
is
reason
to
think
that
it
is
let
us
leave
precarious
speculations
about
finiteness
and
infinity
to
philosophers
and
take
the
universe
as
we
know
it
picture
then
on
the
more
moderate
estimate
these
suns
scattered
over
tens
of
thousands
of
billions
of
miles
whether
they
form
one
stupendous
system
and
what
its
structure
may
be
is
too
obscure
a
subject
to
be
discussed
here
imagine
yourself
standing
at
a
point
from
which
you
can
survey
the
whole
system
and
see
into
the
depths
and
details
of
it
at
one
point
is
a
single
star
like
our
sun
billions
of
miles
from
its
nearest
neighbour
wearing
out
its
solitary
life
in
a
portentous
discharge
of
energy
commonly
the
stars
are
in
pairs
turning
round
a
common
centre
in
periods
that
may
occupy
hundreds
of
days
or
hundreds
of
years
here
and
there
they
are
gathered
into
clusters
sometimes
to
the
number
of
thousands
in
a
cluster
travelling
together
over
the
desert
of
space
or
trailing
in
lines
like
luminous
caravans
all
are
rushing
headlong
at
inconceivable
speeds
few
are
known
to
be
so
sluggish
as
to
run
like
our
sun
at
only
miles
an
hour
one
of
the
fixed
stars
of
the
ancients
the
mighty
arcturus
darts
along
at
a
rate
of
more
than
miles
a
second
as
they
rush
their
surfaces
glowing
at
a
temperature
anywhere
between
and
degrees
they
shake
the
environing
space
with
electric
waves
from
every
tiny
particle
of
their
body
at
a
rate
of
from
billion
to
billion
waves
a
second
and
somewhere
round
the
fringe
of
one
of
the
smaller
suns
there
is
a
little
globe
more
than
a
million
times
smaller
than
the
solitary
star
it
attends
lost
in
the
blaze
of
its
light
on
which
human
beings
find
a
home
during
a
short
and
late
chapter
of
its
history
look
at
it
again
from
another
aspect
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
is
found
in
the
stars
emerald
azure
ruby
gold
lilac
topaz
fawn
they
shine
with
wonderful
and
mysterious
beauty
but
whether
these
more
delicate
shades
be
really
in
the
stars
or
no
three
colours
are
certainly
found
in
them
the
stars
sink
from
bluish
white
to
yellow
and
on
to
deep
red
the
immortal
fires
of
the
greeks
are
dying
piercing
the
depths
with
a
dull
red
glow
here
and
there
are
the
dying
suns
and
if
you
look
closely
you
will
see
flitting
like
ghosts
across
the
light
of
their
luminous
neighbours
the
gaunt
frames
of
dead
worlds
here
and
there
are
vast
stretches
of
loose
cosmic
dust
that
seems
to
be
gathering
into
embryonic
stars
here
and
there
are
stars
in
infancy
or
in
strenuous
youth
you
detect
all
the
chief
phases
of
the
making
of
a
world
in
the
forms
and
fires
of
these
colossal
aggregations
of
matter
like
the
chance
crowd
on
which
you
may
look
down
in
the
square
of
a
great
city
they
range
from
the
infant
to
the
worn
and
sinking
aged
there
is
this
difference
however
that
the
embryos
of
worlds
sprawl
gigantic
and
luminous
across
the
expanse
that
the
dark
and
mighty
bodies
of
the
dead
rush
like
the
rest
at
twenty
or
fifty
miles
a
second
and
that
at
intervals
some
appalling
blaze
that
dims
even
the
fearful
furnaces
of
the
living
seems
to
announce
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
there
is
this
further
difference
that
strewn
about
the
intermediate
space
between
the
gigantic
spheres
is
a
mass
of
cosmic
dust
minute
grains
or
large
blocks
or
shoals
consisting
of
myriads
of
pieces
or
immeasurable
clouds
of
fine
gas
that
seems
to
be
the
rubbish
left
over
after
the
making
of
worlds
or
the
material
gathering
for
the
making
of
other
worlds
this
is
the
universe
that
the
nineteenth
century
discovered
and
the
twentieth
century
is
interpreting
before
we
come
to
tell
the
fortunes
of
our
little
earth
we
have
to
see
how
matter
is
gathered
into
these
stupendous
globes
of
fire
how
they
come
sometimes
to
have
smaller
bodies
circling
round
them
on
which
living
things
may
appear
how
they
supply
the
heat
and
light
and
electricity
that
the
living
things
need
and
how
the
story
of
life
on
a
planet
is
but
a
fragment
of
a
larger
story
we
have
to
study
the
birth
and
death
of
worlds
perhaps
the
most
impressive
of
all
the
studies
that
modern
science
offers
us
indeed
if
we
would
read
the
whole
story
of
evolution
there
is
an
earlier
chapter
even
than
this
the
latest
chapter
to
be
opened
by
science
the
first
to
be
read
we
have
to
ask
where
the
matter
which
we
are
going
to
gather
into
worlds
itself
came
from
to
understand
more
clearly
what
is
the
relation
to
it
of
the
forces
or
energies
gravitation
electricity
with
which
we
glibly
mould
it
into
worlds
or
fashion
it
into
living
things
and
above
all
to
find
out
its
relation
to
this
mysterious
ocean
of
ether
in
which
it
is
found
less
than
half
a
century
ago
the
making
of
worlds
was
in
popular
expositions
of
science
a
comparatively
easy
business
take
an
indefinite
number
of
atoms
of
various
gases
and
metals
scatter
them
in
a
fine
cloud
over
some
thousands
of
millions
of
miles
of
space
let
gravitation
slowly
compress
the
cloud
into
a
globe
its
temperature
rising
through
the
compression
let
it
throw
off
a
ring
of
matter
which
in
turn
gravitation
will
compress
into
a
globe
and
you
have
your
earth
circulating
round
the
sun
it
is
not
quite
so
simple
in
any
case
serious
men
of
science
wanted
to
know
how
these
convenient
and
assorted
atoms
happened
to
be
there
at
all
and
what
was
the
real
meaning
of
this
equally
convenient
gravitation
there
was
a
greater
truth
than
he
knew
in
the
saying
of
an
early
physicist
that
the
atom
had
the
look
of
a
manufactured
article
it
was
increasingly
felt
as
the
nineteenth
century
wore
on
that
the
atoms
had
themselves
been
evolved
out
of
some
simpler
material
and
that
ether
might
turn
out
to
be
the
primordial
chaos
there
were
even
those
who
felt
that
ether
would
prove
to
be
the
one
source
of
all
matter
and
energy
and
just
before
the
century
closed
a
light
began
to
shine
in
those
deeper
abysses
of
the
submaterial
world
and
the
foundations
of
the
universe
began
to
appear
chapter
ii
the
foundations
of
the
universe
to
the
mind
of
the
vast
majority
of
earlier
observers
the
phrase
foundations
of
the
universe
would
have
suggested
something
enormously
massive
and
solid
from
what
we
have
already
seen
we
are
prepared
on
the
contrary
to
pass
from
the
inconceivably
large
to
the
inconceivably
small
our
sun
is
as
far
as
our
present
knowledge
goes
one
of
modest
dimensions
arcturus
and
canopus
must
be
thousands
of
times
larger
than
it
yet
our
sun
is
times
heavier
than
the
earth
and
the
earth
weighs
some
tons
but
it
is
only
in
resolving
these
stupendous
masses
into
their
tiniest
elements
that
we
can
reach
the
ultimate
realities
or
foundations
of
the
whole
modern
science
rediscovered
the
atoms
of
democritus
analysed
the
universe
into
innumerable
swarms
of
these
tiny
particles
and
then
showed
how
the
infinite
variety
of
things
could
be
built
up
by
their
combinations
for
this
it
was
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
atoms
were
not
all
alike
but
belonged
to
a
large
number
of
different
classes
from
letters
of
the
alphabet
we
could
make
millions
of
different
words
from
forty
or
fifty
different
elements
the
chemist
could
construct
the
most
varied
objects
in
nature
from
the
frame
of
a
man
to
a
landscape
but
improved
methods
of
research
led
to
the
discovery
of
new
elements
and
at
last
the
chemist
found
that
he
had
seventy
or
eighty
of
these
ultimate
realities
each
having
its
own
very
definite
and
very
different
characters
as
it
is
the
experience
of
science
to
find
unity
underlying
variety
this
was
profoundly
unsatisfactory
and
the
search
began
for
the
great
unity
which
underlay
the
atoms
of
matter
the
difficulty
of
the
search
may
be
illustrated
by
a
few
figures
very
delicate
methods
were
invented
for
calculating
the
size
of
the
atoms
laymen
are
apt
to
smile
it
is
a
very
foolish
smile
at
these
figures
but
it
is
enough
to
say
that
the
independent
and
even
more
delicate
methods
suggested
by
recent
progress
in
physics
have
quite
confirmed
them
take
a
cubic
millimetre
of
hydrogen
as
a
millimetre
is
less
than
of
an
inch
the
reader
must
imagine
a
tiny
bubble
of
gas
that
would
fit
comfortably
inside
the
letter
o
as
it
is
printed
here
the
various
refined
methods
of
the
modern
physicist
show
that
there
are
billion
molecules
each
consisting
of
two
atoms
of
the
gas
in
this
tiny
bubble
it
is
a
little
universe
repeating
on
an
infinitesimal
scale
the
numbers
and
energies
of
the
stellar
universe
these
molecules
are
not
packed
together
moreover
but
are
separated
from
each
other
by
spaces
which
are
enormous
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
atoms
through
these
empty
spaces
the
atoms
dash
at
an
average
speed
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
each
passing
something
like
of
its
neighbours
in
the
course
of
every
second

this

of

thinly
populated

very
small

are
about
a
quadrillion
atoms
it
is
these
minute
and
elusive
particles
that
modern
physics
sets
out
to
master
at
first
it
was
noticed
that
the
atom
of
hydrogen
was
the
smallest
or
lightest
of
all
and
the
other
atoms
seemed
to
be
multiples
of
it
a
russian
chemist
mendeleeff
drew
up
a
table
of
the
elements
in
illustration
of
this
grouping
them
in
families
which
seemed
to
point
to
hydrogen
as
the
common
parent
or
ultimate
constituent
of
each
when
newly
discovered
elements
fell
fairly
into
place
in
this
scheme
the
idea
was
somewhat
confidently
advanced
that
the
evolution
of
the
elements
was
discovered
thus
an
atom
of
carbon
seemed
to
be
a
group
of
atoms
of
hydrogen
an
atom
of
oxygen
an
atom
of
sulphur
an
atom
of
copper
an
atom
of
silver
an
atom
of
gold
and
so
on
but
more
correct
measurements
showed
that
these
figures
were
not
quite
exact
and
the
fraction
of
inexactness
killed
the
theory
long
before
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
students
were
looking
wistfully
to
the
ether
for
some
explanation
of
the
mystery
it
was
the
veiled
statue
of
isis
in
the
scientific
world
and
it
resolutely
kept
its
veil
in
spite
of
all
progress
the
upper
and
limpid
air
of
the
greeks
the
cosmic
ocean
of
giordano
bruno
was
now
an
established
reality
it
was
the
vehicle
that
bore
the
terrific
streams
of
energy
from
star
to
planet
across
the
immense
reaches
of
space
as
the
atoms
of
matter
lay
in
it
one
thought
of
the
crystal
forming
in
its
or
the
star
forming
in
the
nebula
and
wondered
whether
the
atom
was
not
in
some
such
way
condensed
out
of
the
ether
by
the
last
decade
of
the
century
the
theory
was
confidently
advanced
notably
by
lorentz
and
larmor
though
it
was
still
without
a
positive
basis
how
the
basis
was
found
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
may
be
told
very
briefly
sir
william
crookes
had
in
applied
himself
to
the
task
of
creating
something
more
nearly
like
a
vacuum
than
the
old
afforded
when
he
had
found
the
means
of
reducing
the
quantity
of
gas
in
a
tube
until
it
was
a
million
times
thinner
than
the
atmosphere
he
made
the
experiment
of
sending
an
electric
discharge
through
it
and
found
a
very
curious
result
from
the
cathode
the
negative
electric
point
certain
rays
proceeded
which
caused
a
green
fluorescence
on
the
glass
of
the
tube
since
the
discharge
did
not
consist
of
the
atoms
of
the
gas
he
concluded
that
it
was
a
new
and
mysterious
substance
which
he
called
radiant
matter
but
no
progress
was
made
in
the
interpretation
of
this
strange
material
the
crookes
tube
became
one
of
the
toys
of
science
and
the
lamp
of
other
investigators
in
rontgen
drew
closer
attention
to
the
crookes
tube
by
discovering
the
rays
which
he
called
but
which
now
bear
his
name
they
differ
from
ordinary
in
their
length
their
irregularity
and
especially
their
power
to
pass
through
opaque
bodies
a
number
of
distinguished
physicists
now
took
up
the
study
of
the
effect
of
sending
an
electric
discharge
through
a
vacuum
and
the
particles
of
radiant
matter
were
soon
identified
sir
thomson
especially
was
brilliantly
successful
in
his
interpretation
he
proved
that
they
were
tiny
corpuscles
more
than
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
the
atom
of
hydrogen
charged
with
negative
electricity
and
travelling
at
the
rate
of
thousands
of
miles
a
second
they
were
the
electrons
in
which
modern
physics
sees
the
constituents
of
the
atom
no
sooner
had
interest
been
thoroughly
aroused
than
it
was
announced
that
a
fresh
discovery
had
opened
a
new
shaft
into
the
underworld
sir
thomson
pursuing
his
research
found
in
that
compounds
of
uranium
sent
out
rays
that
could
penetrate
black
paper
and
affect
the
photographic
plate
though
in
this
case
the
french
physicist
becquerel
made
the
discovery
simultaneously
and
was
the
first
to
publish
it
an
army
of
investigators
turned
into
the
new
field
and
sought
to
penetrate
the
deep
abyss
that
had
almost
suddenly
disclosed
itself
the
quickening
of
astronomy
by
galilei
or
of
zoology
by
darwin
was
slight
in
comparison
with
the
stirring
of
our
physical
world
by
these
increasing
discoveries
and
in
and
mme
curie
made
the
further
discovery
which
in
the
popular
mind
obliterated
all
the
earlier
achievements
they
succeeded
in
isolating
the
new
element
radium
which
exhibits
the
actual
process
of
an
atom
parting
with
its
minute
constituents
the
story
of
radium
is
so
recent
that
a
few
lines
will
suffice
to
recall
as
much
as
is
needed
for
the
purpose
of
this
chapter
in
their
study
of
the
emanations
from
uranium
compounds
the
curies
were
led
to
isolate
the
various
elements
of
the
compounds
until
they
discovered
that
the
discharge
was
predominantly
due
to
one
specific
element
radium
radium
is
itself
probably
a
product
of
the
disintegration
of
uranium
the
heaviest
of
known
metals
with
an
atomic
weight
some
times
greater
than
that
of
hydrogen
but
this
massive
atom
of
uranium
has
a
life
that
is
computed
in
thousands
of
millions
of
years
it
is
in
radium
and
its
offspring
that
we
see
most
clearly
the
constitution
of
matter
a
gramme
less
than
grains
of
radium
contains
we
will
economise
our
space
superscript
atoms
this
tiny
mass
is
by
its
discharge
parting
with
its
substance
at
the
rate
of
one
atom
per
second
for
every
atoms
in
other
words
the
indestructible
atom
has
in
this
case
a
term
of
life
not
exceeding
years
in
the
discharge
from
the
radium
three
elements
have
been
distinguished
the
first
consists
of
atoms
of
the
gas
helium
which
are
hurled
off
at
between
and
miles
a
second
the
third
element
in
the
order
of
classification
consists
of
waves
analogous
to
the
rontgen
rays
but
the
second
element
is
a
stream
of
electrons
which
are
expelled
from
the
atom
at
the
appalling
speed
of
about
miles
a
second
professor
le
bon
has
calculated
that
it
would
take
barrels
of
powder
to
discharge
a
bullet
at
that
speed
but
we
shall
see
more
presently
of
the
enormous
energy
displayed
within
the
little
system
of
the
atom
we
may
add
that
after
its
first
transformation
the
radium
passes
much
more
quickly
through
a
further
series
of
changes
the
frontiers
of
the
atomic
systems
were
breaking
down
the
next
step
was
for
students
notably
soddy
and
rutherford
to
find
that
or
spontaneous
discharge
out
of
the
atomic
systems
was
not
confined
to
radium
not
only
are
other
rare
metals
conspicuously
active
but
it
is
found
that
such
familiar
surfaces
as
damp
cellars
rain
snow
emit
a
lesser
discharge
the
value
of
the
new
material
thus
provided
for
the
student
of
physics
may
be
shown
by
one
illustration
sir
thomson
observes
that
before
these
recent
discoveries
the
investigator
could
not
detect
a
gas
unless
about
a
billion
molecules
of
it
were
present
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
spectroscope
had
already
gone
far
beyond
ordinary
chemical
analysis
in
detecting
the
presence
of
substances
in
minute
quantities
since
these
discoveries
we
can
recognise
a
single
molecule
bearing
an
electric
charge
with
these
extraordinary
powers
the
physicist
is
able
to
penetrate
a
world
that
lies
immeasurably
below
the
range
of
the
most
powerful
microscope
and
introduce
us
to
systems
more
bewildering
than
those
of
the
astronomer
we
pass
from
a
portentous
brobdingnagia
to
a
still
more
portentous
lilliputia
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
mass
of
the
electron
is
the
part
of
that
of
an
atom
of
hydrogen
of
which
as
we
saw
billions
of
molecules
have
ample
space
to
execute
their
terrific
movements
within
the
limits
of
the
letter
o
it
has
been
further
shown
that
these
electrons
are
identical
from
whatever
source
they
are
obtained
the
physicist
therefore
concludes
warning
us
that
on
this
further
point
he
is
drawing
a
theoretical
conclusion
that
the
atoms
of
ordinary
matter
are
made
up
of
electrons
if
that
is
the
case
the
hydrogen
atom
the
lightest
of
all
must
be
a
complex
system
of
some
electrons
and
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
atomic
weight
the
clusters
grow
larger
and
larger
until
we
come
to
the
atoms
of
the
heavier
metals
with
more
than
electrons
in
each
atom
but
this
is
not
the
most
surprising
part
of
the
discovery
tiny
as
the
dimensions
of
the
atom
are
they
afford
a
vast
space
for
the
movement
of
these
energetic
little
bodies
the
speed
of
the
stars
in
their
courses
is
slow
compared
with
the
flight
of
the
electrons
since
they
fly
out
of
the
system
in
the
conditions
we
have
described
at
a
speed
of
between
and
miles
a
second
they
must
be
revolving
with
terrific
rapidity
within
it
indeed
the
most
extraordinary
discovery
of
all
is
that
of
the
energy
imprisoned
within
these
tiny
systems
which
men
have
for
ages
regarded
as
dead
matter
sir
thomson
calculates
that
allowing
only
one
electron
to
each
atom
in
a
gramme
of
hydrogen
the
tiny
globule
of
gas
will
contain
as
much
energy
as
would
be
obtained
by
burning
tons
of
coal
if
he
says
an
appreciable
fraction
of
the
energy
that
is
contained
in
ordinary
matter
were
to
be
set
free
the
earth
would
explode
and
return
to
its
primitive
nebulous
condition
fournier
tells
us
that
the
force
with
which
electrons
repel
each
other
is
a
quadrillion
times
greater
than
the
force
of
gravitation
that
brings
atoms
together
and
that
if
two
grammes
of
pure
electrons
could
be
placed
one
centimetre
apart
they
would
repel
each
other
with
a
force
equal
to
quadrillion
tons
the
inexpert
imagination
reels
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
speed
of
the
electron
is
a
measured
quantity
and
it
is
within
the
resources
of
science
to
estimate
the
force
necessary
to
project
it
at
that
speed
see
sir
thomson
the
corpuscular
theory
of
matter
and
for
a
more
elementary
presentment
light
visible
and
invisible
and
fournier
the
electron
theory
such
are
the
discoveries
of
the
last
fifteen
years
and
a
few
of
the
mathematical
deductions
from
them
we
are
not
yet
in
a
position
to
say
positively
that
the
atoms
are
composed
of
electrons
but
it
is
clear
that
the
experts
are
properly
modest
in
claiming
only
that
this
is
highly
probable
the
atom
seems
to
be
a
little
universe
in
which
in
combination
with
positive
electricity
the
nature
of
which
is
still
extremely
obscure
from
to
electrons
revolve
at
a
speed
that
reaches
as
high
as
miles
a
second
instead
of
being
crowded
together
however
in
their
minute
system
each
of
them
has
in
proportion
to
its
size
as
ample
a
space
to
move
in
as
a
single
speck
of
dust
would
have
in
a
room
thomson
this
theory
not
only
meets
all
the
facts
that
have
been
discovered
in
an
industrious
decade
of
research
not
only
offers
a
splendid
prospect
of
introducing
unity
into
the
different
elements
of
the
chemist
but
it
opens
out
a
still
larger
prospect
of
bringing
a
common
measure
into
the
diverse
forces
of
the
universe
light
is
already
generally
recognised
as
a
rapid
series
of
waves
or
pulses
in
ether
magnetism
becomes
intelligible
as
a
condition
of
a
body
in
which
the
electrons
revolve
round
the
atom
in
nearly
the
same
plane
the
difference
between
positive
and
negative
electricity
is
at
least
partly
illuminated
an
atom
will
repel
an
atom
when
its
equilibrium
is
disturbed
by
the
approach
of
an
additional
electron
the
physicist
even
follows
the
movement
of
the
added
electron
and
describes
it
revolving
billion
times
a
second
round
the
atom
to
escape
being
absorbed
in
it
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
conductors
of
electricity
becomes
intelligible
the
atoms
of
metals
are
so
close
together
that
the
roaming
electrons
pass
freely
from
one
atom
to
another
in
copper
it
is
calculated
the
electron
combines
with
an
atom
and
is
liberated
again
a
hundred
million
times
a
second
even
chemical
action
enters
the
sphere
of
explanation
however
these
hypotheses
may
fare
the
electron
is
a
fact
and
the
atom
is
very
probably
a
more
or
less
stable
cluster
of
electrons
but
when
we
go
further
and
attempt
to
trace
the
evolution
of
the
electron
out
of
ether
we
enter
a
region
of
pure
theory
some
of
the
experts
conceive
the
electron
as
a
minute
whirlpool
or
vortex
in
the
ocean
of
ether
some
hold
that
it
is
a
centre
of
strain
in
ether
some
regard
ether
as
a
densely
packed
mass
of
infinitely
small
grains
and
think
that
the
positive
and
negative
corpuscles
as
they
seem
to
us
are
tiny
areas
in
which
the
granules
are
unequally
distributed
each
theory
has
its
difficulties
we
do
not
know
the
origin
of
the
electron
because
we
do
not
know
the
nature
of
ether
to
some
it
is
an
elastic
solid
quivering
in
waves
at
every
movement
of
the
particles
to
others
it
is
a
continuous
fluid
every
cubic
millimetre
of
which
possesses
an
energy
equivalent
to
the
output
of
a
station
for
years
lodge
to
others
it
is
a
granular
mass
with
a
pressure
of
tons
per
square
centimetre
we
must
wait
it
is
little
over
ten
years
since
the
vaults
were
opened
and
physicists
began
to
peer
into
the
world
the
lower
perhaps
lowest
depth
is
reserved
for
another
generation
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
research
of
the
last
ten
years
has
given
us
a
glimpse
of
the
foundations
of
the
universe
every
theory
of
the
electron
assumes
it
to
be
some
sort
of
nodule
or
disturbed
area
in
the
ether
it
is
sometimes
described
as
a
particle
of
negative
electricity
and
associated
with
a
particle
of
positive
electricity
in
building
up
the
atom
the
phrase
is
misleading
for
those
who
regard
electricity
as
a
force
or
energy
and
it
gives
rise
to
speculation
as
to
whether
matter
has
not
been
resolved
into
force
force
or
energy
is
not
conceived
by
physicists
as
a
substantial
reality
like
matter
but
an
abstract
expression
of
certain
relations
of
matter
or
electrons
in
any
case
the
ether
whether
solid
or
fluid
or
granular
remains
the
fundamental
reality
the
universe
does
not
float
in
an
ocean
of
ether
it
is
an
ocean
of
ether
but
countless
myriads
of
minute
disturbances
are
found
in
this
ocean
and
set
it
quivering
with
the
various
pulses
which
we
classify
as
forces
or
energies
these
points
of
disturbance
cluster
together
in
systems
atoms
of
from
to
members
and
the
atoms
are
pressed
together
until
they
come
in
the
end
to
form
massive
worlds
it
remains
only
to
reduce
gravitation
itself
which
brings
the
atoms
together
to
a
strain
or
stress
in
ether
and
we
have
a
superb
unity
that
has
not
yet
been
done
but
every
theory
of
gravitation
assumes
that
it
is
a
stress
in
the
ether
corresponding
to
the
formation
of
the
minute
disturbances
which
we
call
electrons
but
it
may
be
urged
he
who
speaks
of
foundations
speaks
of
a
beginning
of
a
structure
he
who
speaks
of
evolution
must
have
a
was
there
a
time
when
the
ether
was
a
smooth
continuous
fluid
without
electrons
or
atoms
and
did
they
gradually
appear
in
it
like
crystals
in
the
in
science
we
know
nothing
of
a
beginning
the
question
of
the
eternity
or
of
matter
or
ether
is
as
futile
as
the
question
about
its
infinity
or
finiteness
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
that
science
can
trace
the
processes
of
nature
back
for
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
millions
of
years
and
has
ground
to
think
that
the
universe
then
presented
much
the
same
aspect
as
it
does
now
and
will
in
thousands
of
millions
of
years
to
come
but
if
these
periods
were
quadrillions
instead
of
millions
of
years
they
would
still
have
no
relation
to
the
idea
of
eternity
all
that
we
can
say
is
that
we
find
nothing
in
nature
that
points
to
a
beginning
or
an
end
a
theory
has
been
advanced
by
some
physicists
that
there
is
evidence
of
a
beginning
within
our
experience
energy
is
being
converted
into
heat
more
abundantly
than
heat
is
being
converted
into
other
energy
this
would
hold
out
a
prospect
of
a
paralysed
universe
and
that
stage
would
have
been
reached
long
ago
if
the
system
had
not
had
a
definite
beginning
but
what
knowledge
have
we
of
conversions
of
energy
in
remote
regions
of
space
in
the
depths
of
stars
or
nebulae
or
in
the
world
of
which
we
have
just
caught
a
glimpse
roundly
none
the
speculation
is
worthless
one
point
only
need
be
mentioned
in
conclusion
do
we
anywhere
perceive
the
evolution
of
the
material
elements
out
of
electrons
just
as
we
perceive
the
devolution
or
disintegration
of
atoms
into
electrons
there
is
good
ground
for
thinking
that
we
do
the
subject
will
be
discussed
more
fully
in
the
next
chapter
in
brief
the
spectroscope
which
examines
the
light
of
distant
stars
and
discovers
what
chemical
elements
emitted
it
finds
matter
in
the
hottest
stars
in
an
unusual
condition
and
seems
to
show
the
elements
successively
emerging
from
their
fierce
alchemy
sir
norman
lockyer
has
for
many
years
conducted
a
special
investigation
of
the
subject
at
the
solar
physics
observatory
and
he
declares
that
we
can
trace
the
evolution
of
the
elements
out
of
the
fiery
chaos
of
the
young
star
the
lightest
gases
emerge
first
the
metals
later
and
in
a
special
form
but
here
we
pass
once
more
from
lilliputia
to
brobdingnagia
and
must
first
explain
the
making
of
the
star
itself
chapter
iii
the
birth
and
death
of
worlds
the
greater
part
of
this
volume
will
be
occupied
with
the
things
that
have
happened
on
one
small
globe
in
the
universe
during
a
certain
number
of
millions
of
years
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
has
a
somewhat
narrow
and
parochial
aspect
the
earth
is
you
remember
a
million
times
smaller
than
the
sun
and
the
sun
itself
is
a
very
modest
citizen
of
the
stellar
universe
our
procedure
is
justified
however
both
on
the
ground
of
personal
interest
and
because
our
knowledge
of
the
story
is
so
much
more
ample
and
confident
yet
we
must
preface
the
story
of
the
earth
with
at
least
a
general
outline
of
the
larger
story
of
the
universe
no
sensible
man
is
humbled
or
dismayed
by
the
vastness
of
the
universe
when
the
human
mind
reflects
on
its
wonderful
scientific
mastery
of
this
illimitable
ocean
of
being
it
has
no
sentiment
of
being
dwarfed
or
degraded
it
looks
out
with
cold
curiosity
over
the
mighty
scattering
of
worlds
and
asks
how
they
including
our
own
world
came
into
being
we
now
approach
this
subject
with
a
clearer
perception
of
the
work
we
have
to
do
the
universe
is
a
vast
expanse
of
ether
and
somehow
or
other
this
ether
gives
rise
to
atoms
of
matter
we
may
imagine
it
as
a
spacious
chamber
filled
with
cosmic
dust
recollecting
that
the
chamber
has
no
walls
and
that
the
dust
arises
in
the
ether
itself
the
problem
we
now
approach
is
in
a
word
how
are
these
enormous
stretches
of
cosmic
dust
which
we
call
matter
swept
together
and
compressed
into
suns
and
planets
the
most
famous
answer
to
this
question
is
the
nebular
hypothesis
let
us
see
briefly
how
it
came
into
modern
science
we
saw
that
some
of
the
ancient
greek
speculators
imagined
their
infinite
number
of
atoms
as
scattered
originally
like
dust
throughout
space
and
gradually
coming
together
as
dust
does
to
form
worlds
the
way
in
which
they
brought
their
atoms
together
was
wrong
but
the
genius
of
democritus
had
provided
the
germ
of
another
sound
theory
to
the
students
of
a
more
enlightened
age
descartes
recalled
the
idea
and
set
out
a
theory
of
the
evolution
of
stars
and
planets
from
a
diffused
chaos
of
particles
he
even
ventured
to
say
that
the
earth
was
at
one
time
a
small
sun
and
that
a
solid
crust
had
gradually
formed
round
its
molten
core
descartes
had
taken
refuge
in
sweden
from
his
persecutors
and
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
that
strange
genius
swedenborg
shortly
afterwards
developed
the
same
idea
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
great
french
naturalist
buffon
followed
and
improved
upon
descartes
and
swedenborg
from
buffon
work
it
was
learned
by
the
german
philosopher
kant
who
published
a
fresh
theory
of
the
concentration
of
scattered
particles
into
fiery
worlds
then
laplace
took
up
the
speculation
and
gave
it
the
form
in
which
it
practically
ruled
astronomy
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
that
is
the
genealogy
of
the
famous
nebular
hypothesis
it
did
not
spring
from
the
brain
of
either
kant
or
laplace
like
athene
from
the
brain
of
zeus
laplace
had
one
great
advantage
over
the
early
speculators
not
only
was
he
an
able
astronomer
and
mathematician
but
by
his
time
it
was
known
that
nebulae
or
vast
clouds
of
dispersed
matter
actually
existed
in
the
heavens
here
was
a
solid
basis
for
the
speculation
sir
william
herschel
the
most
assiduous
explorer
of
the
heavens
was
a
contemporary
of
laplace
laplace
therefore
took
the
nebula
as
his
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
of
solid
matter
say
tobacco
will
fill
a
vast
space
when
it
is
turned
into
smoke
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
it
would
expand
still
more
laplace
imagined
the
billions
of
tons
of
matter
which
constitute
our
solar
system
similarly
dispersed
converted
into
a
fine
gas
immeasurably
thinner
than
the
atmosphere
this
nebula
would
be
gradually
drawn
in
again
by
gravitation
just
as
the
dust
falls
to
the
floor
of
a
room
the
collisions
of
its
particles
as
they
fell
toward
the
centre
would
raise
its
temperature
and
give
it
a
rotating
movement
a
time
would
come
when
the
centrifugal
force
at
the
outer
ring
of
the
rotating
disk
would
equal
the
centripetal
or
inward
pull
of
gravity
and
this
ring
would
be
detached
still
spinning
round
the
central
body
the
material
of
the
ring
would
slowly
gather
by
gravitation
round
some
denser
area
in
it
the
ring
would
become
a
sphere
we
should
have
the
first
and
outermost
planet
circling
round
the
sun
other
rings
would
successively
be
detached
and
form
the
rest
of
the
planets
and
the
sun
is
the
shrunken
and
condensed
body
of
the
nebula
so
simple
and
beautiful
a
theory
of
the
solar
system
could
not
fail
to
captivate
astronomers
but
it
is
generally
rejected
in
the
precise
form
which
laplace
gave
it
what
the
difficulties
are
which
it
has
encountered
and
the
modifications
it
must
suffer
we
shall
see
later
as
well
as
the
new
theories
which
have
largely
displaced
it
it
will
be
better
first
to
survey
the
universe
from
the
evolutionary
point
of
view
but
i
may
observe
in
passing
that
the
sceptical
remarks
one
hears
at
times
about
scientific
theories
contradicting
and
superseding
each
other
are
frivolous
one
great
idea
pervades
all
the
theories
of
the
evolution
of
worlds
and
that
idea
is
firmly
established
the
stars
and
their
planets
are
enormous
aggregations
of
cosmic
dust
swept
together
and
compressed
by
the
action
of
gravitation
the
precise
nature
of
this
cosmic
dust
whether
it
was
gas
meteorites
and
gas
or
other
particles
is
open
to
question
as
we
saw
in
the
first
chapter
the
universe
has
the
word
evolution
written
literally
in
letters
of
fire
across
it
the
stars
are
of
all
ages
from
sturdy
youth
to
decrepit
age
and
even
to
the
darkness
of
death
we
saw
that
this
can
be
detected
on
the
superficial
test
of
colour
the
colours
of
the
stars
are
it
is
true
an
unsafe
ground
to
build
upon
the
astronomer
still
puzzles
over
the
gorgeous
colours
he
finds
at
times
especially
in
double
stars
the
topaz
and
azure
companions
in
beta
cygni
the
emerald
and
red
of
alpha
herculis
the
yellow
and
rose
of
eta
cassiopeiae
and
so
on
it
is
at
the
present
time
under
discussion
in
astronomy
how
far
these
colours
are
objective
at
all
or
whether
if
they
are
real
they
may
not
be
due
to
causes
other
than
temperature
yet
the
significance
of
the
three
predominating
colours
yellow
and
red
has
been
sustained
by
the
spectroscope
it
is
the
series
of
colours
through
which
a
bar
of
iron
passes
as
it
cools
and
the
spectroscope
gives
us
good
ground
to
conclude
that
the
stars
are
cooling
when
a
glowing
gas
not
under
great
pressure
is
examined
by
the
spectroscope
it
yields
a
few
vertical
lines
or
bars
of
light
on
a
dark
background
when
a
glowing
liquid
or
solid
is
examined
it
gives
a
continuous
stretch
of
colour
some
of
the
nebulae
give
the
former
type
of
spectrum
and
are
thus
known
to
be
masses
of
luminous
gas
many
of
the
nebulae
and
the
stars
have
the
latter
type
of
spectrum
but
the
stretch
of
light
in
the
spectrum
of
a
star
is
crossed
vertically
by
a
number
of
dark
lines
and
experiment
in
the
laboratory
has
taught
us
how
to
interpret
these
they
mean
that
there
is
some
vapour
between
the
source
of
light
and
the
instrument
in
the
case
of
the
stars
they
indicate
the
presence
of
an
atmosphere
of
relatively
cool
vapours
and
an
increase
in
the
density
of
that
atmosphere
which
is
shown
by
a
multiplication
and
broadening
of
the
dark
lines
on
the
spectrum
means
an
increase
of
age
a
loss
of
vitality
and
ultimately
death
so
we
get
the
descending
scale
of
spectra
the
dark
lines
are
thinnest
and
least
numerous
in
the
blue
stars
more
numerous
in
the
yellow
heavy
and
thick
in
the
red
as
the
body
of
the
star
sinks
in
temperature
dense
masses
of
cool
vapour
gather
about
it
its
light
as
we
perceive
it
turns
yellow
then
red
the
next
step
which
the
spectroscope
can
not
follow
will
be
the
formation
of
a
scum
on
the
cooling
surface
ending
after
ages
of
struggle
in
the
imprisonment
of
the
molten
interior
under
a
solid
dark
crust
let
us
see
how
our
sun
illustrates
this
theory
it
is
in
the
yellow
or
what
we
may
call
the
autumnal
stage
miss
clerke
and
a
few
others
have
questioned
this
but
the
evidence
is
too
strong
the
vast
globe
miles
in
diameter
seems
to
be
a
mass
of
much
the
same
material
as
the
earth
about
forty
elements
have
been
identified
in
it
but
at
a
terrific
temperature
the
surface
is
found
on
the
most
recent
calculations
to
have
a
temperature
of
about
degrees
this
surface
is
an
ocean
of
liquid
or
vaporised
metals
several
thousand
miles
in
depth
some
think
that
the
brilliant
light
comes
chiefly
from
clouds
of
incandescent
carbon
overlying
it
is
a
deep
layer
of
the
vapours
of
the
molten
metals
with
a
temperature
of
about
degrees
and
to
this
comparatively
cool
and
layer
we
owe
the
black
lines
of
the
solar
spectrum
above
it
is
an
ocean
of
hydrogen
and
outside
this
again
is
an
atmosphere
stretching
for
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
into
space
the
significant
feature
from
our
point
of
view
is
the
though
the
spot
may
be
an
area
of
millions
of
square
miles
these
areas
are
of
course
dark
only
by
comparison
with
the
intense
light
of
the
rest
of
the
disk
the
darkest
part
of
them
is
times
brighter
than
the
full
moon
it
will
be
seen
further
on
examining
a
photograph
of
the
sun
that
a
network
or
veining
of
this
dark
material
overspreads
the
entire
surface
at
all
times
there
is
still
some
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
nature
of
these
areas
but
the
evidence
of
the
spectroscope
has
convinced
most
astronomers
that
they
are
masses
of
cooler
vapour
lying
upon
and
sinking
into
the
ocean
of
liquid
fire
round
their
edges
as
if
responding
to
the
pressure
of
the
more
condensed
mass
gigantic
spurts
and
mountains
of
the
matter
of
the
sun
rush
upwards
at
a
rate
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
miles
a
second
sometimes
they
reach
a
height
of
a
hundred
and
even
two
hundred
thousand
miles
driving
the
hydrogen
before
them
in
prodigious
and
fantastic
flames
between
the
black
veins
over
the
disk
also
there
rise
domes
and
columns
of
the
liquid
fire
some
hundreds
of
miles
in
diameter
spreading
and
sinking
at
from
five
to
twenty
miles
a
second
the
surface
of
the
sun
how
much
more
the
interior
is
an
appalling
cauldron
of
incandescent
matter
from
pole
to
pole
every
yard
of
the
surface
is
a
hundred
times
as
intense
as
the
open
furnace
of
a
titanic
from
the
depths
and
from
the
surface
of
this
fiery
ocean
as
on
a
small
scale
from
the
surface
of
the
tropical
sea
the
vapours
rise
high
into
the
extensive
atmosphere
discharge
some
of
their
heat
into
space
and
sink
back
cooler
and
heavier
upon
the
disk
this
is
a
star
in
its
yellow
age
as
are
capella
and
arcturus
and
other
stars
the
red
stars
carry
the
story
further
as
we
should
expect
the
heavier
lines
in
their
spectrum
indicate
more
absorption
of
light
and
tell
us
that
the
vapours
are
thickening
about
the
globe
while
compounds
like
titanium
oxide
make
their
appearance
announcing
a
fall
of
temperature
below
these
again
is
a
group
of
dark
red
or
carbon
stars
in
which
the
process
is
carried
further
thick
broad
dark
lines
in
the
red
end
of
the
spectrum
announce
the
appearance
of
compounds
of
carbon
and
a
still
lower
fall
of
temperature
the
veil
is
growing
thicker
the
life
is
ebbing
from
the
great
frame
then
the
star
sinks
below
the
range
of
visibility
and
one
would
think
that
we
can
follow
the
dying
world
no
farther
fortunately
in
the
case
of
algol
and
some
thirty
or
forty
other
stars
an
extinct
sun
betrays
its
existence
by
flitting
across
the
light
of
a
luminous
sun
and
recent
research
has
made
it
probable
that
the
universe
is
strewn
with
dead
worlds
some
of
them
may
be
still
in
the
condition
which
we
seem
to
find
in
jupiter
hiding
sullen
fires
under
a
dense
shell
of
cloud
some
may
already
be
covered
with
a
crust
like
the
earth
there
are
even
stars
in
which
one
is
tempted
to
see
an
intermediate
stage
stars
which
blaze
out
periodically
from
dimness
as
if
the
cyclops
were
spending
his
last
energy
in
spasms
that
burst
the
forming
roof
of
his
prison
but
these
variable
stars
are
still
obscure
and
we
do
not
need
their
aid
the
downward
course
of
a
star
is
fairly
plain
when
we
turn
to
the
earlier
chapters
in
the
life
of
a
star
the
story
is
less
clear
it
is
at
least
generally
agreed
that
the
stars
exhibit
an
earlier
and
hotter
stage
they
show
comparatively
little
absorption
and
there
is
an
immense
preponderance
of
the
lighter
gases
hydrogen
and
helium
they
sirius
vega
etc
are
in
fact
known
as
hydrogen
stars
and
their
temperature
is
generally
computed
at
between
and
degrees
a
few
stars
such
as
procyon
and
canopus
seem
to
indicate
a
stage
between
them
and
the
yellow
or
solar
type
but
we
may
avoid
finer
shades
of
opinion
and
disputed
classes
and
be
content
with
these
clear
stages
we
begin
with
stars
in
which
only
hydrogen
and
helium
the
lightest
of
elements
can
be
traced
and
the
hydrogen
is
in
an
unfamiliar
form
implying
terrific
temperature
in
the
next
stage
we
find
the
lines
of
oxygen
nitrogen
magnesium
and
silicon
metals
such
as
iron
and
copper
come
later
at
first
in
a
primitive
and
unusual
form
lastly
we
get
the
compounds
of
titanium
and
carbon
and
the
densely
shaded
spectra
which
tell
of
the
thickly
gathering
vapours
the
intense
cold
of
space
is
slowly
prevailing
in
the
great
struggle
what
came
before
the
star
it
is
now
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
nebula
taking
the
word
for
the
moment
in
the
general
sense
of
a
loose
chaotic
mass
of
material
was
the
first
stage
professor
keeler
calculated
that
there
are
at
least
nebulae
within
range
of
our
telescopes
and
the
number
is
likely
to
be
increased
a
german
astronomer
recently
counted
on
one
photographic
plate
many
of
them
moreover
are
so
vast
that
they
must
contain
the
material
for
making
a
great
number
of
worlds

that
each
one
of
the
points
of
light
that
are
dotted
over
the
expanse
is
a
star
of
a
million
miles
or
more
in
diameter
taking
our
sun
as
below
the
average
and
that
the
great
cloud
that
sprawls
across
space
is
at
least
billion
miles
away
how
much
more
no
man
knows
it
is
futile
to
attempt
to
calculate
the
extent
of
that
vast
stretch
of
luminous
gas
we
can
safely
say
that
it
is
at
least
a
million
times
as
large
as
the
whole
area
of
our
solar
system
but
it
may
run
to
trillions
or
quadrillions
of
miles
nearly
a
hundred
other
nebulae
are
known
by
the
spectroscope
to
be
clouds
of
luminous
gas
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
and
that
the
nebula
is
correctly
called
a
electrical
and
other
agencies
may
make
gases
luminous
and
many
astronomers
think
that
the
nebulae
are
intensely
cold
however
the
majority
of
the
nebulae
that
have
been
examined
are
not
gaseous
and
have
a
very
different
structure
from
the
loose
and
diffused
clouds
of
gas
they
show
two
possibly
more
but
generally
two
great
spiral
arms
starting
from
the
central
part
and
winding
out
into
space
as
they
are
flat
or
we
see
this
structure
plainly
when
they
turn
full
face
toward
the
earth
as
does
the
magnificent
nebula
in
canes
venatici
in
it
and
many
others
we
clearly
trace
a
condensed
central
mass
with
two
great
arms
each
apparently
having
smaller
centres
of
condensation
sprawling
outward
like
the
broken
spring
of
a
watch
the
same
structure
can
be
traced
in
the
mighty
nebula
in
andromeda
which
is
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
it
is
said
that
more
than
half
the
nebulae
in
the
heavens
are
spiral
knowing
that
they
are
masses
of
solid
or
liquid
fire
we
are
tempted
to
see
in
them
gigantic
the
fireworks
of
the
gods
what
is
their
relation
to
the
stars
in
the
first
place
their
mere
existence
has
provided
a
solid
basis
for
the
nebular
hypothesis
and
their
spiral
form
irresistibly
suggests
that
they
are
whirling
round
on
their
central
axis
and
concentrating
further
we
find
in
some
of
the
gaseous
nebulae
orion
comparatively
void
spaces
occupied
by
stars
which
seem
to
have
absorbed
the
nebulous
matter
in
their
formation
on
the
other
hand
we
find
in
the
pleiades
wisps
and
streamers
of
nebulous
matter
clinging
about
great
clusters
of
stars
suggesting
that
they
are
material
left
over
when
these
clustered
worlds
crystallised
out
of
some
vast
nebula
and
enormous
stretches
of
nebulous
material
covering
regions
as
in
perseus
where
the
stars
are
as
thick
as
grains
of
silver
more
important
still
we
find
a
type
of
cosmic
body
which
seems
intermediate
between
the
star
and
the
nebula
it
is
a
more
or
less
imperfectly
condensed
star
surrounded
by
nebular
masses
but
one
of
the
most
instructive
links
of
all
is
that
at
times
a
nebula
is
formed
from
a
star
and
a
recent
case
of
this
character
may
be
briefly
described
in
february
a
new
star
appeared
in
the
constellation
perseus
knowing
what
a
star
is
the
reader
will
have
some
dim
conception
of
the
portentous
blaze
that
lit
up
that
remote
region
of
space
at
least
billion
miles
away
when
he
learns
that
the
light
of
this
star
increased
in
hours
it
reached
a
brilliance
times
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
telescopes
and
spectroscopes
were
turned
on
it
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
and
the
spectroscope
showed
that
masses
of
glowing
hydrogen
were
rushing
out
from
it
at
a
rate
of
nearly
a
thousand
miles
a
second
its
light
gradually
flickered
and
fell
however
and
the
star
sank
back
into
insignificance
but
the
photographic
plate
now
revealed
a
new
and
most
instructive
feature
before
the
end
of
the
year
there
was
a
nebula
of
enormous
extent
spreading
out
on
both
sides
from
the
centre
of
the
eruption
it
was
suggested
at
the
time
that
the
bursting
of
a
star
may
merely
have
lit
up
a
previously
dark
nebula
but
the
spectroscope
does
not
support
this
a
dim
star
had
dissolved
wholly
or
partially
into
a
nebula
as
a
result
of
some
mighty
cataclysm
what
the
nature
of
the
catastrophe
was
we
will
inquire
presently
these
are
a
few
of
the
actual
connections
that
we
find
between
stars
and
nebulae
probably
however
the
consideration
that
weighs
most
with
the
astronomer
is
that
the
condensation
of
such
a
loose
expanse
of
matter
affords
an
admirable
explanation
of
the
enormous
heat
of
the
stars
until
recently
there
was
no
other
conceivable
source
that
would
supply
the
sun
tremendous
outpour
of
energy
for
tens
of
millions
of
years
except
the
compression
of
its
substance
it
is
true
that
the
discovery
of
has
disclosed
a
new
source
of
energy
within
the
atoms
themselves
and
there
are
scientific
men
like
professor
arrhenius
who
attach
great
importance
to
this
source
but
although
it
may
prolong
the
limited
term
of
life
which
physicists
formerly
allotted
to
the
sun
and
other
stars
it
is
still
felt
that
the
condensation
of
a
nebula
offers
the
best
explanation
of
the
origin
of
a
sun
and
we
have
ample
evidence
for
the
connection
we
must
therefore
see
what
the
nebula
is
and
how
it
develops
nebula
is
merely
the
latin
word
for
cloud
whatever
the
nature
of
these
diffused
stretches
of
matter
may
be
then
the
name
applies
fitly
to
them
and
any
theory
of
the
development
of
a
star
from
them
is
still
a
nebular
hypothesis
but
the
three
theories
which
divide
astronomers
differ
as
to
the
nature
of
the
nebula
the
older
theory
pointing
to
the
gaseous
nebulae
as
the
first
stage
holds
that
the
nebula
is
a
cloud
of
extremely
attenuated
gas
the
meteoritic
hypothesis
sir
lockyer
sir
darwin
etc
observing
that
space
seems
to
swarm
with
meteors
and
that
the
greater
part
of
the
nebulae
are
not
gaseous
believes
that
the
is
a
colossal
swarm
of
meteors
surrounded
by
the
gases
evolved
and
lit
up
by
their
collisions
the
planetesimal
hypothesis
advanced
in
recent
years
by
professor
moulton
and
professor
chamberlin
contends
that
the
nebula
is
a
vast
cloud
of
liquid
or
solid
but
not
gaseous
particles
this
theory
is
based
mainly
on
the
dynamical
difficulties
of
the
other
two
which
we
will
notice
presently
the
truth
often
lies
between
conflicting
theories
or
they
may
apply
to
different
cases
it
is
not
improbable
that
this
will
be
our
experience
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
initial
nebula
the
gaseous
nebulae
and
the
formation
of
such
nebulae
from
disrupted
stars
are
facts
that
can
not
be
ignored
the
nebulae
with
a
continuous
spectrum
and
therefore
in
part
at
least
in
a
liquid
or
solid
condition
may
very
well
be
regarded
as
a
more
advanced
stage
of
condensation
of
the
same
their
spiral
shape
and
conspicuous
nuclei
are
consistent
with
this
moreover
a
condensing
swarm
of
meteors
would
owing
to
the
heat
evolved
tend
to
pass
into
a
gaseous
condition
on
the
tether
hand
a
huge
expanse
of
gas
stretched
over
billions
of
miles
of
space
would
be
a
net
for
the
wandering
particles
meteors
and
comets
that
roam
through
space
if
it
be
true
as
is
calculated
that
our
miles
of
atmosphere
capture
a
hundred
million
meteors
a
day
what
would
the
millions
or
billions
of
times
larger
net
of
a
nebula
catch
even
if
the
gas
is
so
much
thinner
in
other
words
it
is
not
wise
to
draw
too
fine
a
line
between
a
gaseous
nebula
and
one
consisting
of
solid
particles
with
gas
the
more
important
question
is
how
do
astronomers
conceive
the
condensation
of
this
mixed
mass
of
cosmic
dust
it
is
easy
to
reply
that
gravitation
or
the
pressure
of
the
surrounding
ether
slowly
drives
the
particles
and
compresses
the
dust
into
globes
as
the
boy
squeezes
the
flocculent
snow
into
balls
and
it
is
not
difficult
for
the
mathematician
to
show
that
this
condensation
would
account
for
the
shape
and
temperature
of
the
stars
but
we
must
go
a
little
beyond
this
superficial
statement
and
see
to
some
extent
how
the
deeper
students
work
out
the
process
see
especially
lowell
the
evolution
of
worlds
professor
arrhenius

the
making

and
chamberlin
and
salisbury

vol
ii
taking
a
broad
view
of
the
whole
field
one
may
say
that
the
two
chief
difficulties
are
as
follows
first
how
to
get
the
whole
chaotic
mass
whirling
round
in
one
common
direction
secondly
how
to
account
for
the
fact
that
in
our
solar
system
the
outermost
planets
and
satellites
do
not
rotate
in
the
same
direction
as
the
rest
there
is
a
widespread
idea
that
these
difficulties
have
proved
fatal
to
the
old
nebular
hypothesis
and
there
are
distinguished
astronomers
who
think
so
but
sir
ball
see
note
professor
lowell
see
note
professor
pickering
annals
of
harvard
college
observatory
iii
and
other
high
authorities
deny
this
and
work
out
the
newly
discovered
movements
on
the
lines
of
the
old
theory
they
hold
that
all
the
bodies
in
the
solar
system
once
turned
in
the
same
direction
as
uranus
and
neptune
and
the
tidal
influence
of
the
sun
has
changed
the
rotation
of
most
of
them
the
planets
farthest
from
the
sun
would
naturally
not
be
so
much
affected
by
it
the
same
principle
would
explain
the
retrograde
movement
of
the
outer
satellites
of
saturn
and
jupiter
sir
ball
further
works
out
the
principles
on
which
the
particles
of
the
condensing
nebula
would
tend
to
form
a
disk
rotating
on
its
central
axis
the
of
laplace
is
practically
abandoned
the
spiral
nebula
is
evidently
the
standard
type
and
the
condensing
nebula
must
conform
to
it
in
this
we
are
greatly
helped
by
the
current
theory
of
the
origin
of
spiral
nebulae
we
saw
previously
that
new
stars
sometimes
appear
in
the
sky
and
the
recent
closer
scrutiny
of
the
heavens
shows
this
occurrence
to
be
fairly
frequent
it
is
still
held
by
a
few
astronomers
that
such
a
cataclysm
means
that
two
stars
collided
even
a
partial
or
grazing
collision
between
two
masses
each
weighing
billions
of
tons
travelling
on
the
average
forty
or
fifty
miles
a
second
a
movement
that
would
increase
enormously
as
they
approach
each
other
would
certainly
liquefy
or
vaporise
their
substance
but
the
astronomer
accustomed
to
see
cosmic
bodies
escape
each
other
by
increasing
their
speed
is
generally
disinclined
to
believe
in
collisions
some
have
made
the
new
star
plunge
into
the
heart
of
a
dense
and
dark
nebula
some
have
imagined
a
shock
of
two
gigantic
swarms
of
meteors
some
have
regarded
the
outflame
as
the
effect
of
a
prodigious
explosion
in
one
or
other
new
star
each
or
any
of
these
things
may
have
occurred
but
the
most
plausible
and
accepted
theory
for
the
new
star
of
and
some
others
is
that
two
stars
had
approached
each
other
too
closely
in
their
wandering
suppose
that
in
millions
of
years
to
come
when
our
sun
is
extinct
and
a
firm
crust
surrounds
the
great
molten
ball
some
other
sun
approaches
within
a
few
million
miles
of
it
the
two
would
rush
past
each
other
at
a
terrific
speed
but
the
gravitational
effect
of
the
approaching
star
would
tear
open
the
solid
shell
of
the
sun
and
in
a
mighty
flame
its
molten
and
gaseous
entrails
would
be
flung
out
into
space
it
has
long
been
one
of
the
arguments
against
a
molten
interior
of
the
earth
that
the
gravitational
influence
would
raise
it
in
gigantic
tides
and
rend
the
solid
shell
of
rock
it
is
even
suspected
now
that
our
small
earth
is
not
without
a
tidal
influence
on
the
sun
the
comparatively
near
approach
of
two
suns
would
lead
to
a
terrific
cataclysm
if
we
accept
this
theory
the
origin
of
the
spiral
nebula
becomes
intelligible
as
the
sun
from
which
it
is
formed
is
already
rotating
on
its
axis
we
get
a
rotation
of
the
nebula
from
the
first
the
mass
poured
out
from
the
body
of
the
sun
would
even
if
it
were
only
a
small
fraction
of
its
mass
suffice
to
make
a
planetary
system
all
our
planets
and
their
satellites
taken
together
amount
to
only
of
the
mass
of
the
solar
system
we
may
assume
further
that
the
outpoured
matter
would
be
a
mixed
cloud
of
gases
and
solid
and
liquid
particles
and
that
it
would
stream
out
possibly
in
successive
waves
from
more
than
one
part
of
the
disrupted
sun
tending
to
form
great
spiral
trails
round
the
parent
mass
some
astronomers
even
suggest
that
as
there
are
tidal
waves
raised
by
the
moon
at
opposite
points
of
the
earth
similar
tidal
outbursts
would
occur
at
opposite
points
on
the
disk
of
the
disrupted
star
and
thus
give
rise
to
the
characteristic
arms
starting
from
opposite
sides
of
the
spiral
nebula
this
is
not
at
all
clear
as
the
two
tidal
waves
of
the
earth
are
due
to
the
fact
that
it
has
a
liquid
ocean
rolling
on
not
under
a
solid
bed
in
any
case
we
have
here
a
good
suggestion
of
the
origin
of
the
spiral
nebula
and
of
its
further
development
as
soon
as
the
outbursts
are
over
and
the
scattered
particles
have
reached
the
farthest
limit
to
which
they
are
hurled
the
concentrating
action
of
gravitation
will
slowly
assert
itself
if
we
conceive
this
gravitational
influence
as
the
pressure
of
the
surrounding
ether
we
get
a
wider
understanding
of
the
process
much
of
the
dispersed
matter
may
have
been
shot
far
enough
into
space
to
escape
the
gravitational
pull
of
the
parent
mass
and
will
be
added
to
the
sum
of
scattered
cosmic
dust
meteors
and
close
shoals
of
meteors
comets
wandering
in
space
much
of
the
rest
will
fall
back
upon
the
central
body
but
in
the
great
spiral
arms
themselves
the
distribution
of
the
matter
will
be
irregular
and
the
denser
areas
will
slowly
gather
in
the
surrounding
material
in
the
end
we
would
thus
get
secondary
spheres
circling
round
a
large
primary
this
is
the
way
in
which
astronomers
now
generally
conceive
the
destruction
and
of
worlds
on
one
point
the
new
planetesimal
theory
differs
from
the
other
theories
it
supposes
that
since
the
particles
of
the
whirling
nebula
are
all
travelling
in
the
same
general
direction
they
overtake
each
other
with
less
violent
impact
than
the
other
theories
suppose
and
therefore
the
condensation
of
the
material
into
planets
would
not
give
rise
to
the
terrific
heat
which
is
generally
assumed
we
will
consider
this
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
deal
with
the
formation
of
the
planets
as
far
as
the
central
body
the
sun
is
concerned
there
can
be
no
hesitation
the
incandescent
suns
in
the
heavens
are
eloquent
proof
of
the
appalling
heat
that
is
engendered
by
the
collisions
of
the
concentrating
particles
in
general
outline
we
now
follow
the
story
of
a
star
with
some
confidence
an
internal
explosion
a
fatal
rush
into
some
dense
nebula
or
swarm
of
meteors
a
collision
with
another
star
or
an
approach
within
a
few
million
miles
of
another
star
scatters
in
part
or
whole
the
solid
or
liquid
globe
in
a
cloud
of
cosmic
dust
when
the
violent
outrush
is
over
the
dust
is
gathered
together
once
more
into
a
star
at
first
cold
and
attenuated
its
temperature
rises
as
the
particles
come
together
and
we
have
after
a
time
an
incandescent
nucleus
shining
through
a
thin
veil
of
gas
a
nebulous
star
the
temperature
rises
still
further
and
we
have
the
star
in
which
the
elements
seem
to
be
dissociated
and
slowly
as
the
temperature
falls
after
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
of
years
it
reaches
the
yellow
stage
and
if
it
has
planets
with
the
conditions
of
life
there
may
be
a
temporary
opportunity
for
living
things
to
enjoy
its
tempered
energy
but
the
cooler
vapours
are
gathering
round
it
and
at
length
its
luminous
body
is
wholly
imprisoned
it
continues
its
terrific
course
through
space
until
some
day
perhaps
it
again
encounters
the
mighty
cataclysm
which
will
make
it
begin
afresh
the
long
and
stormy
chapters
of
its
living
history
such
is
the
suggestion
of
the
modern
astronomer
and
although
we
seem
to
find
every
phase
of
the
theory
embodied
in
the
varied
contents
of
the
heavens
we
must
not
forget
that
it
is
only
a
suggestion
the
spectroscope
and
telescopic
photography
which
are
far
more
important
than
the
visual
telescope
are
comparatively
recent
and
the
field
to
be
explored
is
enormous
the
mist
is
lifting
from
the
cosmic
landscape
but
there
is
still
enough
to
blur
our
vision
very
puzzling
questions
remain
unanswered
what
is
the
origin
of
the
great
gaseous
nebulae
what
is
the
origin
of
the
triple
or
quadruple
star
what
is
the
meaning
of
stars
whose
light
ebbs
and
flows
in
periods
of
from
a
few
to
several
hundred
days
we
may
even
point
to
the
fact
that
some
at
least
of
the
spiral
nebulae
are
far
too
vast
to
be
the
outcome
of
the
impact
or
approach
of
two
stars
we
may
be
content
to
think
that
we
have
found
out
some
truths
by
no
means
the
whole
truth
about
the
evolution
of
worlds
throughout
this
immeasurable
ocean
of
ether
the
particles
of
matter
are
driven
together
and
form
bodies
these
bodies
swarm
throughout
space
like
fish
in
the
sea
travelling
singly
the
shooting
star
or
in
great
close
shoals
the
nucleus
of
a
comet
or
lying
scattered
in
vast
clouds
but
the
inexorable
pressure
urges
them
still
until
billions
of
tons
of
material
are
gathered
together
then
either
from
the
sheer
heat
of
the
compression
or
from
the
formation
of
large
and
unstable
atomic
systems
radium
etc
or
both
the
great
mass
becomes
a
cauldron
of
fire
mantled
in
its
own
vapours
and
the
story
of
a
star
is
run
it
dies
out
in
one
part
of
space
to
begin
afresh
in
another
we
see
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
beginning
or
an
end
for
the
totality
of
worlds
the
universe
the
life
of
all
living
things
on
the
earth
from
the
formation
of
the
primitive
microbes
to
the
last
struggles
of
the
superman
is
a
small
episode
of
that
stupendous
drama
a
fraction
of
a
single
scene
but
our
ampler
knowledge
of
it
and
our
personal
interest
in
it
magnify
that
episode
and
we
turn
from
the
cosmic
picture
to
study
the
formation
of
the
earth
and
the
rise
of
its
living
population
chapter
iv
the
preparation
of
the
earth
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
our
solar
system
is
it
will
now
be
seen
a
local
instance
of
the
great
cosmic
process
we
have
studied
in
the
last
chapter
we
may
take
one
of
the
small
spiral
nebulae
that
abound
in
the
heavens
as
an
illustration
of
the
first
stage
if
a
still
earlier
stage
is
demanded
we
may
suppose
that
some
previous
sun
collided
with
or
approached
too
closely
another
mighty
body
and
belched
out
a
large
part
of
its
contents
in
mighty
volcanic
outpours
mathematical
reasoning
can
show
that
this
erupted
material
would
gather
into
a
spiral
nebula
but
as
mathematical
calculations
can
not
be
given
here
and
are
less
safe
than
astronomical
facts
we
will
be
content
to
see
the
early
shape
of
our
solar
system
in
a
relatively
small
spiral
nebula
its
outermost
arm
stretching
far
beyond
the
present
orbit
of
neptune
and
its
great
nucleus
being
our
present
sun
in
more
diffused
form
we
need
not
now
attempt
to
follow
the
shrinking
of
the
central
part
of
the
nebula
until
it
becomes
a
rounded
fiery
sun
that
has
been
done
in
tracing
the
evolution
of
a
star
here
we
have
to
learn
how
the
planets
were
formed
from
the
spiral
arms
of
the
nebula
the
principle
of
their
formation
is
already
clear
the
same
force
of
gravitation
or
the
same
pressure
of
the
surrounding
ether
which
compresses
the
central
mass
into
a
fiery
globe
will
act
upon
the
loose
material
of
the
arms
and
compress
it
into
smaller
globes
but
there
is
an
interesting
and
acute
difference
of
opinion
amongst
modern
experts
as
to
whether
these
smaller
globes
the
early
planets
would
become
bodies
the
general
opinion
especially
among
astronomers
is
that
the
compression
of
the
nebulous
material
of
the
arms
into
globes
would
generate
enormous
heat
as
in
the
case
of
the
sun
on
that
view
the
various
planets
would
begin
their
careers
as
small
suns
and
would
pass
through
those
stages
of
cooling
and
shrinking
which
we
have
traced
in
the
story
of
the
stars
a
glance
at
the
photograph
of
one
of
the
spiral
nebulae
strongly
confirms
this
great
luminous
knots
or
nuclei
are
seen
at
intervals
in
the
arms
smaller
suns
seem
to
be
forming
in
them
each
gathering
into
its
body
the
neighbouring
material
of
the
arm
and
rising
in
temperature
as
the
mass
is
compressed
into
a
globe
the
spectroscope
shows
that
these
knots
are
condensing
masses
of
liquid
or
solid
matter
it
therefore
seems
plain
that
each
planet
will
first
become
a
liquid
globe
of
fire
coursing
round
the
central
sun
and
will
gradually
as
its
heat
is
dissipated
and
the
supply
begins
to
fail
form
a
solid
crust
this
familiar
view
is
challenged
by
the
new
planetesimal
hypothesis
which
has
been
adopted
by
many
distinguished
geologists
chamberlin
gregory
coleman
in
their
view
the
particles
in
the
arms
of
the
nebula
are
all
moving
in
the
same
direction
round
the
sun
they
therefore
quietly
overtake
the
nucleus
to
which
they
are
attracted
instead
of
violently
colliding
with
each
other
and
much
less
heat
is
generated
at
the
surface
in
that
case
the
planets
would
not
pass
through
a
or
even
stage
at
all
they
are
formed
by
a
slow
ingathering
of
the
scattered
particles
which
are
called
planetesimals
round
the
larger
or
denser
masses
of
stuff
which
were
discharged
by
the
exploding
sun
possibly
these
masses
were
prevented
from
falling
back
into
the
sun
by
the
attraction
of
the
colliding
body
or
the
body
which
caused
the
eruption
they
would
revolve
round
the
parent
body
and
the
shoals
of
smaller
particles
would
gather
about
them
by
gravitation
if
there
were
any
large
region
in
the
arm
of
the
nebula
which
had
no
single
massive
nucleus
the
cosmic
dust
would
gather
about
a
number
of
smaller
centres
thus
might
be
explained
the
hundreds
of
planetoids
or
minor
planets
which
we
find
between
mars
and
jupiter
if
these
smaller
bodies
came
within
the
sphere
of
influence
of
one
of
the
larger
planets
yet
were
travelling
quickly
enough
to
resist
its
attraction
they
would
be
compelled
to
revolve
round
it
and
we
could
thus
explain
the
ten
satellites
of
saturn
and
the
eight
of
jupiter
our
moon
we
shall
see
had
a
different
origin
we
shall
find
this
new
hypothesis
crossing
the
familiar
lines
at
many
points
in
the
next
few
chapters
we
will
consider
those
further
consequences
as
they
arise
but
may
say
at
once
that
while
the
new
theory
has
greatly
helped
us
in
tracing
the
formation
of
the
planetary
system
astronomers
are
strongly
opposed
to
its
claim
that
the
planets
did
not
pass
through
an
incandescent
stage
the
actual
features
of
our
spiral
nebulae
seem
clearly
to
exhibit
that
stage
the
shape
of
the
planets
globular
bodies
flattened
at
the
poles
strongly
suggests
that
they
were
once
liquid
the
condition
in
which
we
find
saturn
and
jupiter
very
forcibly
confirms
this
suggestion
the
latest
study
of
those
planets
supports
the
current
opinion
that
they
are
still
and
even
seems
to
detect
the
glow
of
their
surfaces
in
their
mantles
of
cloud
these
points
will
be
considered
more
fully
presently
for
the
moment
it
is
enough
to
note
that
as
far
as
the
early
stages
of
planetary
development
are
concerned
the
generally
accepted
theory
rests
on
a
mass
of
positive
evidence
while
the
new
hypothesis
is
purely
theoretical
we
therefore
follow
the
prevailing
view
with
some
confidence
those
of
the
spiral
nebulae
which
face
the
earth
squarely
afford
an
excellent
suggestion
of
the
way
in
which
planets
are
probably
formed
in
some
of
these
nebulae
the
arms
consist
of
almost
continuous
streams
of
faintly
luminous
matter
in
others
the
matter
is
gathering
about
distinct
centres
in
others
again
the
nebulous
matter
is
for
the
most
part
collected
in
large
glowing
spheres
they
seem
to
be
successive
stages
and
to
reveal
to
us
the
origin
of
our
planets
the
position
of
each
planet
in
our
solar
system
would
be
determined
by
the
chance
position
of
the
denser
stuff
shot
out
by
the
erupting
sun
i
have
seen
vesuvius
hurl
up
into
the
sky
amongst
its
blasts
of
gas
and
steam
masses
of
rock
weighing
fifty
tons
in
the
far
fiercer
outburst
of
the
erupting
sun
there
would
be
at
least
thinner
and
denser
masses
and
they
must
have
been
hurled
so
far
into
space
that
their
speed
in
travelling
round
the
central
body
perhaps
seconded
by
the
attraction
of
the
second
star
overcame
the
gravitational
pull
back
to
the
centre
recollect
the
force
which
in
the
new
star
in
perseus
drove
masses
of
hydrogen
for
millions
of
miles
at
a
speed
of
a
thousand
miles
a
second
these
denser
nuclei
or
masses
would
when
the
eruption
was
over
begin
to
attract
to
themselves
all
the
lighter
nebulous
material
within
their
sphere
of
gravitational
influence
naturally
there
would
at
first
be
a
vast
confusion
of
small
and
large
centres
of
condensation
in
the
arms
of
the
nebula
moving
in
various
directions
but
a
kind
of
natural
selection
and
in
this
case
survival
of
the
biggest
would
ensue
the
conflicting
movements
would
be
adjusted
by
collisions
and
gravitation
the
smaller
bodies
would
be
absorbed
in
the
larger
or
enslaved
as
their
satellites
and
the
last
state
would
be
a
family
of
smaller
suns
circling
at
vast
distances
round
the
parent
body
the
planets
moreover
would
be
caused
to
rotate
on
their
axes
besides
revolving
round
the
sun
as
the
particles
at
their
inner
edge
nearer
the
sun
would
move
at
a
different
speed
from
those
at
the
outer
edge
in
the
course
of
time
the
smaller
bodies
having
less
heat
to
lose
and
less
or
no
atmosphere
to
check
the
loss
would
cool
down
and
become
dark
solid
spheres
lit
only
by
the
central
fire
while
the
first
stage
of
this
theory
of
development
is
seen
in
the
spiral
nebula
the
later
stages
seem
to
be
well
exemplified
in
the
actual
condition
of
our
planets
following
chiefly
the
latest
research
of
professor
lowell
and
his
colleagues
which
marks
a
considerable
advance
on
our
previous
knowledge
we
shall
find
it
useful
to
glance
at
the
before
we
approach
the
particular
story
of
our
earth
mercury
the
innermost
and
smallest
of
the
planets
measuring
only
some
miles
in
diameter
is
not
unexpectedly
an
airless
wilderness
small
bodies
are
unable
to
retain
the
gases
at
their
surface
on
account
of
their
feebler
gravitation
we
find
moreover
that
mercury
always
presents
the
same
face
to
the
sun
as
it
turns
on
its
axis
in
the
same
period
days
in
which
it
makes
a
revolution
round
the
sun
while
therefore
one
half
of
the
globe
is
buried
in
eternal
darkness
the
other
half
is
eternally
exposed
to
the
direct
and
blistering
rays
of
the
sun
which
is
only
miles
away
to
professor
lowell
it
presents
the
appearance
of
a
bleached
and
desert
or
the
bones
of
a
dead
world
its
temperature
must
be
at
least
degrees
above
that
of
the
earth
its
features
are
what
we
should
expect
on
the
nebular
hypothesis
the
slowness
of
its
rotation
is
accounted
for
by
the
heavy
tidal
influence
of
the
sun
in
the
same
way
our
moon
has
been
influenced
by
the
earth
and
our
earth
by
the
sun
in
their
movement
of
rotation
venus
as
might
be
expected
in
the
case
of
so
large
a
globe
nearly
as
large
as
the
earth
has
an
atmosphere
but
it
seems
like
mercury
always
to
present
the
same
face
to
the
sun
its
comparative
nearness
to
the
sun
miles
probably
explains
this
advanced
effect
of
tidal
action
the
consequences
that
the
observers
deduce
from
the
fact
are
interesting
the
half
of
venus
seems
to
be
devoid
of
water
or
vapour
and
it
is
thought
that
all
its
water
is
gathered
into
a
rigid
on
the
dark
side
of
the
globe
from
which
fierce
hurricanes
must
blow
incessantly
it
is
a
sahara
or
a
desert
far
hotter
than
the
sahara
on
one
side
an
arctic
region
on
the
other
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
world
fitted
for
the
support
of
any
kind
of
life
that
we
can
imagine
when
we
turn
to
the
consideration
of
mars
we
enter
a
world
of
unending
controversy
with
little
more
than
half
the
diameter
of
the
earth
mars
ought
to
be
in
a
far
more
advanced
stage
of
either
life
or
decay
but
its
condition
has
not
yet
been
established
some
hold
that
it
has
a
considerable
atmosphere
others
that
it
is
too
small
a
globe
to
have
retained
a
layer
of
gas
professor
poynting
believes
that
its
temperature
is
below
the
of
water
all
over
the
globe
many
others
if
not
the
majority
of
observers
hold
that
the
white
cap
we
see
at
its
poles
is
a
mass
of
ice
and
snow
or
at
least
a
thick
coat
of
and
that
it
melts
at
the
edges
as
the
springtime
of
mars
comes
round
in
regard
to
its
famous
canals
we
are
no
nearer
agreement
some
maintain
that
the
markings
are
not
really
an
objective
feature
some
hold
that
they
are
due
to
volcanic
activity
and
that
similar
markings
are
found
on
the
moon
some
believe
that
they
are
due
to
clouds
while
professor
lowell
and
others
stoutly
adhere
to
the
familiar
view
that
they
are
artificial
canals
or
the
strips
of
vegetation
along
such
canals
the
question
of
the
actual
habitation
of
mars
is
still
open
we
can
say
only
that
there
is
strong
evidence
of
its
possession
of
the
conditions
of
life
in
some
degree
and
that
living
things
even
on
the
earth
display
a
remarkable
power
of
adaptation
to
widely
differing
conditions
passing
over
the
planetoids
which
circulate
between
mars
and
jupiter
and
for
which
we
may
account
either
by
the
absence
of
one
large
nucleus
in
that
part
of
the
nebulous
stream
or
by
the
disturbing
influence
of
jupiter
we
come
to
the
largest
planet
of
the
system
here
we
find
a
surprising
confirmation
of
the
theory
of
planetary
development
which
we
are
following
three
hundred
times
heavier
than
the
earth
or
more
than
a
trillion
tons
in
weight
yet
a
thousand
times
less
in
volume
than
the
sun
jupiter
ought
if
our
theory
is
correct
to
be
still
all
the
evidence
conspires
to
suggest
that
it
is
it
has
long
been
recognised
that
the
shining
disk
of
the
planet
is
not
a
solid
but
a
cloud
surface
this
impenetrable
mass
of
cloud
or
vapour
is
drawn
out
in
streams
or
belts
from
side
to
side
as
the
giant
globe
turns
on
its
axis
once
in
every
ten
hours
we
can
not
say
if
or
to
what
extent
these
clouds
consist
of
we
can
conclude
only
that
this
mantle
of
jupiter
is
a
seething
cauldron
of
vapours
lowell
and
that
if
the
body
beneath
is
solid
it
must
be
very
hot
a
large
red
area
at
one
time
miles
long
has
more
or
less
persisted
on
the
surface
for
several
decades
and
it
is
generally
interpreted
either
as
a
surface
or
as
a
vast
volcanic
vent
reflecting
its
glow
upon
the
clouds
indeed
the
keen
american
observers
with
their
powerful
telescopes
have
detected
a
glow
on
the
edges
of
the
across
the
disk
and
more
recent
observation
with
the
spectroscope
seems
to
prove
that
jupiter
emits
light
from
its
surface
analogous
to
that
of
the
red
stars
the
conspicuous
flattening
of
its
poles
is
another
feature
that
science
would
expect
in
a
rapidly
rotating
liquid
globe
in
a
word
jupiter
seems
to
be
in
the
last
stage
of
stellar
development
such
at
some
remote
time
was
our
earth
such
one
day
will
be
the
sun
the
neighbouring
planet
saturn
supports
the
conclusion
here
again
we
have
a
gigantic
globe
miles
in
diameter
turning
on
its
axis
in
the
short
space
of
ten
hours
and
here
again
we
find
the
conspicuous
flattening
of
the
poles
the
trailing
belts
of
massed
vapour
across
the
disk
the
red
glow
lighting
the
edges
of
the
belts
and
the
spectroscopic
evidence
of
an
emission
of
light
once
more
it
is
difficult
to
doubt
that
a
highly
heated
body
is
wrapped
in
that
thick
mantle
of
vapour
with
its
ten
moons
and
its
marvellous
an
enormous
collection
of
fragments
which
the
influence
of
the
planet
or
of
its
nearer
satellites
seems
to
have
prevented
from
concentrating
saturn
has
always
been
a
beautiful
object
to
observe
it
is
not
less
interesting
in
those
features
which
we
faintly
detect
in
its
disk
the
next
planet
uranus
miles
in
diameter
seems
to
be
another
greatly
heated
globe
if
not
as
some
think
a
sheer
mass
of
vapours
without
a
liquid
core
neptune
is
too
dim
and
distant
for
profitable
examination
it
may
be
added
however
that
the
dense
masses
of
gas
which
are
found
to
surround
the
outer
planets
seem
to
confirm
the
nebular
theory
which
assumes
that
they
were
developed
in
the
outer
and
lighter
part
of
the
material
hurled
from
the
sun
from
this
encouraging
survey
of
the
we
return
with
more
confidence
to
the
story
of
the
earth
i
will
not
attempt
to
follow
an
imaginative
scheme
in
regard
to
its
early
development
take
four
photographs
one
of
a
spiral
nebula
without
knots
in
its
arms
one
of
a
nebula
like
that
in
canes
venatici
one
of
the
sun
and
one
of
jupiter
and
you
have
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
chief
stages
in
its
formation
in
the
first
picture
a
section
of
the
luminous
arm
of
the
nebula
stretches
thinly
across
millions
of
miles
of
space
in
the
next
stage
this
material
is
largely
collected
in
a
luminous
and
hazy
sphere
as
we
find
in
the
nebula
in
canes
venatici
the
sun
serves
to
illustrate
a
further
stage
in
the
condensation
of
this
sphere
jupiter
represents
a
later
chapter
in
which
the
cooler
vapours
are
wrapped
close
about
the
body
of
the
planet
that
seems
to
have
been
the
early
story
of
the
earth
some
billion
tons
of
the
nebulous
matter
were
attracted
to
a
common
centre
as
the
particles
pressed
centreward
the
temperature
rose
and
for
a
time
the
generation
of
heat
was
greater
than
its
dissipation
whether
the
earth
ever
shone
as
a
small
white
star
we
can
not
say
we
must
not
hastily
conclude
that
such
a
relatively
small
mass
would
behave
like
the
far
greater
mass
of
a
star
but
we
may
without
attempting
to
determine
its
temperature
assume
that
it
runs
an
analogous
course
one
of
the
many
features
which
i
have
indicated
as
pointing
to
a
former
fluidity
of
the
earth
may
be
explained
here
we
shall
see
in
the
course
of
this
work
that
the
mountain
chains
and
other
great
irregularities
of
the
earth
surface
appear
at
a
late
stage
in
its
development
even
as
we
find
them
they
are
seen
to
be
merely
slight
ridges
and
furrows
on
the
face
of
the
globe
when
we
reflect
on
its
enormous
diameter
but
there
is
good
reason
to
think
that
in
the
beginning
the
earth
was
much
nearer
to
a
perfectly
globular
form
this
points
to
a
liquid
or
gaseous
condition
at
one
time
and
the
flattening
of
the
sphere
at
the
poles
confirms
the
impression
we
should
hardly
expect
so
perfect
a
rotundity
in
a
body
formed
by
the
cool
accretion
of
solid
fragments
and
particles
it
is
just
what
we
should
expect
in
a
fluid
body
and
the
later
irregularities
of
the
surface
are
accounted
for
by
the
constant
crumpling
and
wearing
of
its
solid
crust
many
would
find
a
confirmation
of
this
in
the
phenomena
of
volcanoes
geysers
and
earthquakes
and
the
increase
of
the
temperature
as
we
descend
the
crust
but
the
interior
condition
of
the
earth
and
the
nature
of
these
phenomena
are
much
disputed
at
present
and
it
is
better
not
to
rely
on
any
theory
of
them
it
is
suggested
that
radium
may
be
responsible
for
this
subterraneous
heat
the
next
stage
in
the
formation
of
the
earth
is
necessarily
one
that
we
can
reach
only
by
conjecture
over
the
globe
of
molten
fire
the
vapours
and
gases
would
be
suspended
like
a
heavy
canopy
as
we
find
in
jupiter
and
saturn
when
the
period
of
maximum
heat
production
was
passed
however
the
radiation
into
space
would
cause
a
lowering
of
the
temperature
and
a
scum
would
form
on
the
molten
surface
as
may
be
observed
on
the
surface
of
any
cooling
vessel
of
fluid
the
scum
would
stretch
and
crack
the
skin
would
so
to
say
prove
too
small
for
the
body
the
molten
ocean
below
would
surge
through
the
crust
and
bury
it
under
floods
of
lava
some
hold
that
the
slabs
would
sink
in
the
ocean
of
metal
and
thus
the
earth
would
first
solidify
in
its
deeper
layers
there
would
in
any
case
be
an
struggle
between
the
molten
mass
and
the
confining
crust
until
at
length
to
employ
the
old
roman
conception
of
the
activity
of
etna
the
giant
was
imprisoned
below
the
heavy
roof
of
rock
here
again
we
seem
to
find
evidence
of
the
general
correctness
of
the
theory
the
objection
has
been
raised
that
the
geologist
does
not
find
any
rocks
which
he
can
identify
as
portions
of
the
primitive
crust
of
the
earth
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect
the
survival
at
the
surface
of
any
part
of
the
first
scum
that
cooled
on
that
fiery
ocean
it
is
more
natural
to
suppose
that
millions
of
years
of
volcanic
activity
on
a
prodigious
scale
would
characterise
this
early
stage
and
the
primitive
crust
would
be
buried
in
fragments
or
dissolved
again
under
deep
seas
of
lava
now
this
is
precisely
what
we
find
the
oldest
rocks
known
to
the
geologist
the
archaean
rocks
are
overwhelmingly
volcanic
especially
in
their
lower
part
their
thickness
as
we
know
them
is
estimated
at
feet
a
thickness
which
must
represent
many
millions
of
years
but
we
do
not
know
how
much
thicker
than
this
they
may
be
they
underlie
the
oldest
rocks
that
have
ever
been
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
the
geologist
they
include
sedimentary
deposits
showing
the
action
of
water
and
even
probable
traces
of
organic
remains
but
they
are
especially
in
their
deeper
and
older
sections
predominantly
volcanic
they
evince
what
we
may
call
a
volcanic
age
in
the
early
story
of
the
planet
but
before
we
pursue
this
part
of
the
story
further
we
must
interpolate
a
remarkable
event
in
the
record
the
birth
of
the
moon
it
is
now
generally
believed
on
a
theory
elaborated
by
sir
darwin
that
when
the
formation
of
the
crust
had
reached
a
certain
depth
something
over
thirty
miles
it
is
calculated
it
parted
with
a
mass
of
matter
which
became
the
moon
the
size
of
our
moon
in
comparison
with
the
earth
is
so
exceptional
among
the
satellites
which
attend
the
planets
of
our
solar
system
that
it
is
assigned
an
exceptional
origin
it
is
calculated
that
at
that
time
the
earth
turned
on
its
axis
in
the
space
of
four
or
five
hours
instead
of
we
have
already
seen
that
the
tidal
influence
of
the
sun
has
the
effect
of
moderating
the
rotation
of
the
planets
now
this
very
rapid
rotation
of
a
liquid
mass
with
a
thin
crust
would
together
with
the
instability
occasioned
by
its
cooling
cause
it
to
bulge
at
the
equator
the
bulge
would
increase
until
the
earth
became
a
body
the
small
end
of
the
pear
would
draw
further
and
further
away
from
the
rest
as
a
drop
of
water
does
on
the
mouth
of
a
tap
and
at
last
the
whole
mass
some
cubic
miles
of
matter
was
broken
off
and
began
to
pursue
an
independent
orbit
round
the
earth
there
are
astronomers
who
think
that
other
cosmic
bodies
besides
our
moon
may
have
been
formed
in
this
way
possibly
it
is
true
of
some
of
the
double
stars
but
we
will
not
return
to
that
question
the
further
story
of
the
moon
as
it
is
known
to
astronomers
may
be
given
in
a
few
words
the
rotational
movement
of
the
earth
is
becoming
gradually
slower
on
account
of
tidal
influence
our
day
in
fact
becomes
an
hour
longer
every
few
million
years
it
can
be
shown
that
this
had
the
effect
of
increasing
the
speed
and
therefore
enlarging
the
orbit
of
the
moon
as
it
revolved
round
the
earth
as
a
result
the
moon
drew
further
and
further
away
from
the
earth
until
it
reached
its
present
position
about
miles
away
at
the
same
time
the
tidal
influence
of
the
earth
was
lessening
the
rotational
movement
of
the
moon
this
went
on
until
it
turned
on
its
axis
in
the
same
period
in
which
it
revolves
round
the
earth
and
on
this
account
it
always
presents
the
same
face
to
the
earth
through
what
chapters
of
life
the
moon
may
have
passed
in
the
meantime
it
is
impossible
to
say
its
relatively
small
mass
may
have
been
unable
to
keep
the
lighter
gases
at
its
surface
or
its
air
and
water
may
as
some
think
have
been
absorbed
it
is
practically
an
airless
and
waterless
desert
alternating
between
the
heat
of
its
long
day
and
the
intense
cold
of
its
long
night
careful
observers
such
as
professor
pickering
think
that
it
may
still
have
a
shallow
layer
of
heavy
gases
at
its
surface
and
that
this
may
permit
the
growth
of
some
stunted
vegetation
during
the
day
certain
changes
of
colour
which
are
observed
on
its
surface
have
been
interpreted
in
that
sense
we
can
hardly
conceive
any
other
kind
of
life
on
it
in
the
dark
even
the
gases
will
freeze
on
its
surface
as
there
is
no
atmosphere
to
retain
the
heat
indeed
some
students
of
the
moon
fauth
etc
believe
that
it
is
an
unchanging
desert
of
ice
bombarded
by
the
projectiles
of
space
an
ingenious
speculation
as
to
the
effect
on
the
earth
of
this
dislodgment
of
cubic
miles
of
its
substance
is
worth
noting
it
supposes
that
the
bed
of
the
pacific
ocean
represents
the
enormous
gap
torn
in
its
side
by
the
delivery
of
the
moon
at
each
side
of
this
chasm
the
two
continents
the
old
world
and
the
new
would
be
left
floating
on
their
molten
ocean
and
some
have
even
seen
a
confirmation
of
this
in
the
lines
of
crustal
weakness
which
we
trace
by
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
on
either
side
of
the
pacific
others
again
connect
the
shape
of
our
great
masses
of
land
which
generally
run
to
a
southern
point
with
this
early
catastrophe
but
these
interesting
speculations
have
a
very
slender
basis
and
we
will
return
to
the
story
of
the
development
of
the
earth
the
last
phase
in
preparation
for
the
appearance
of
life
would
be
the
formation
of
the
ocean
on
the
lines
of
the
generally
received
nebular
hypothesis
this
can
easily
be
imagined
in
broad
outline
the
gases
would
form
the
outer
shell
of
the
forming
planet
since
the
heavier
particles
would
travel
inward
in
this
mixed
mass
of
gas
the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
would
combine
at
a
fitting
temperature
and
form
water
for
ages
the
molten
crust
would
hold
this
water
suspended
aloft
as
a
surrounding
shell
of
cloud
but
when
the
surface
cooled
to
about
degrees
sollas
the
liquid
would
begin
to
pour
on
it
a
period
of
conflict
would
ensue
the
still
heated
crust
and
the
frequent
volcanic
outpours
sending
the
water
back
in
hissing
steam
to
the
clouds
at
length
and
now
more
rapidly
the
temperature
of
the
crust
would
sink
still
lower
and
a
heated
ocean
would
settle
upon
it
filling
the
hollows
of
its
irregular
surface
and
washing
the
bases
of
its
outstanding
ridges
from
that
time
begins
the
battle
of
the
land
and
the
water
which
we
shall
see
has
had
a
profound
influence
on
the
development
of
life
in
deference
to
the
opinion
of
a
number
of
geologists
we
must
glance
once
more
at
the
alternative
view
of
the
planetesimal
school
in
their
opinion
the
molecules
of
water
were
partly
attracted
to
the
surface
out
of
the
disrupted
matter
and
partly
collected
within
the
porous
outer
layers
of
the
globe
as
the
latter
quantity
grew
it
would
ooze
upwards
fill
the
smaller
depressions
in
the
crust
and
at
length
with
the
addition
of
the
attracted
water
spread
over
the
irregular
surface
there
is
an
even
more
important
difference
of
opinion
in
regard
to
the
formation
of
the
atmosphere
but
we
may
defer
this
until
the
question
of
climate
interests
us
we
have
now
made
our
globe
and
will
pass
on
to
that
early
chapter
of
its
story
in
which
living
things
make
their
appearance
to
some
it
will
seem
that
we
ought
not
to
pass
from
the
question
of
origin
without
a
word
on
the
subject
of
the
age
of
the
earth
all
that
one
can
do
however
is
to
give
a
number
of
very
divergent
estimates
physicists
have
tried
to
calculate
the
age
of
the
sun
from
the
rate
of
its
dissipation
of
heat
and
have
assigned
at
the
most
a
hundred
million
years
to
our
solar
system
but
the
recent
discovery
of
a
source
of
heat
in
the
disintegration
of
such
metals
as
radium
has
made
their
calculations
useless
geologists
have
endeavoured
from
observation
of
the
action
of
geological
agencies
to
estimate
how
long
it
will
have
taken
them
to
form
the
stratified
crust
of
the
earth
but
even
the
best
estimates
vary
between
and
a
hundred
million
years
and
we
have
reason
to
think
that
the
intensity
of
these
geological
agencies
may
have
varied
in
different
ages
chemists
have
calculated
how
long
it
would
take
the
ocean
which
was
originally
fresh
water
to
take
up
from
the
rocks
and
rivers
the
salt
which
it
contains
professor
joly
has
on
this
ground
assigned
a
hundred
million
years
since
the
waters
first
descended
upon
the
crust
we
must
be
content
to
know
that
the
best
recent
estimates
based
on
positive
data
vary
between
fifty
and
a
hundred
million
years
for
the
story
which
we
are
now
about
to
narrate
the
earlier
or
astronomical
period
remains
quite
incalculable
sir
darwin
thinks
that
it
was
probably
at
least
a
thousand
million
years
since
the
moon
was
separated
from
the
earth
whatever
the
period
of
time
may
be
since
some
cosmic
cataclysm
scattered
the
material
of
our
solar
system
in
the
form
of
a
nebula
it
is
only
a
fraction
of
that
larger
and
illimitable
time
which
the
evolution
of
the
stars
dimly
suggests
to
the
scientific
imagination
the
geological
series
the
scale
of

adopted
for
the

that

own

the
record
of
its

and
its

in

there

still
solidly
underlie
the
lowest
depth
he
has
ever
reached
it
is
computed
however
that
these
rocks
as
far
as
they
are
known
to
us
have
a
total
depth
of
nearly
ten
miles
and
seem
therefore
to
represent
at
least
half
the
story
of
the
earth
from
the
time
when
it
rounded
into
a
globe
or
cooled
sufficiently
to
endure
the
presence
of
oceans
yet
all
that
we
read
of
the
earth
story
during
those
many
millions
of
years
could
be
told
in
a
page
or
two
that
section
of
geology
is
still
in
its
infancy
it
is
true
a
day
may
come
when
science
will
decipher
a
long
and
instructive
narrative
in
the
masses
of
quartz
and
gneiss
and
the
layers
of
various
kinds
which
it
calls
the
archaean
rocks
but
we
may
say
with
confidence
that
it
will
not
discover
in
them
more
than
a
few
stray
syllables
of
the
earlier
part
and
none
whatever
of
the
earliest
part
of
the
epic
of
living
nature
a
few
fossilised
remains
of
somewhat
advanced
organisms
such
as
and
worms
are
found
in
the
higher
and
later
rocks
of
the
series
and
more
of
the
same
comparatively
high
types
will
probably
appear
in
the
earlier
strata
representing
an
earlier
stage
of
life
we
find
only
thick
seams
of
black
shale
limestone
and
ironstone
in
which
we
seem
to
see
the
ashes
of
primitive
organisms
cremated
in
the
appalling
fires
of
the
volcanic
age
or
crushed
out
of
recognition
by
the
superimposed
masses
even
if
some
wizardry
of
science
were
ever
to
restore
the
forms
that
have
been
reduced
to
ashes
in
this
archaean
crematorium
it
would
be
found
that
they
are
more
or
less
advanced
forms
far
above
the
original
level
of
life
no
trace
will
ever
be
found
in
the
rocks
of
the
first
few
million
years
in
the
calendar
of
life
the
word
impossible
or
unknowable
is
not
lightly
uttered
in
science
but
there
is
a
very
plain
reason
for
admitting
it
here
the
earliest
living
things
were
at
least
as
primitive
of
nature
as
the
lowest
animals
and
plants
we
know
and
these
up
to
a
fair
level
of
organisation
are
so
soft
of
texture
that
when
they
die
they
leave
no
remains
which
may
one
day
be
turned
into
fossils
some
of
them
indeed
form
tiny
shells
of
flint
or
lime
or
like
the
corals
make
for
themselves
a
solid
bed
but
this
is
a
relatively
late
and
higher
stage
of
development
many
thousands
of
species
of
animals
and
plants
lie
below
that
level
we
are
therefore
forced
to
conclude
from
the
aspect
of
living
nature
that
for
ages
the
early
organisms
had
no
hard
and
preservable
parts
in
thus
declaring
the
impotence
of
geology
however
we
are
at
the
same
time
introducing
another
science
biology
which
can
throw
appreciable
light
on
the
evolution
of
life
let
us
first
see
what
geology
tells
us
about
the
infancy
of
the
earth
the
distribution
of
the
early
rocks
suggests
that
there
was
comparatively
little
dry
land
showing
above
the
surface
of
the
archaean
ocean
our
knowledge
of
these
rocks
is
not
at
all
complete
and
we
must
remember
that
some
of
this
primitive
land
may
be
now
under
the
sea
or
buried
in
unsuspected
regions
it
is
significant
however
that
up
to
the
present
exploration
seems
to
show
that
in
those
remote
ages
only
about
of
our
actual
stood
above
the
level
of
the
waters
apart
from
a
patch
of
some
square
miles
of
what
is
now
australia
and
smaller
patches
in
tasmania
new
zealand
and
india
nearly
the
whole
of
this
land
was
in
the
far
north
a
considerable
area
of
eastern
canada
had
emerged
with
lesser
islands
standing
out
to
the
west
and
south
of
north
america
another
large
area
lay
round
the
basin
of
the
baltic
and
as
greenland
the
hebrides
and
the
extreme
tip
of
scotland
belong
to
the
same
age
it
is
believed
that
a
continent
of
which
they
are
fragments
united
america
and
europe
across
the
north
atlantic
of
the
rest
of
what
is
now
europe
there
were
merely
large
islands
one
on
the
border
of
england
and
wales
others
in
france
spain
and
southern
germany
asia
was
represented
by
a
large
area
in
china
and
siberia
and
an
island
or
islands
on
the
site
of
india
very
little
of
africa
or
south
america
existed
it
will
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
the
physical
story
of
the
earth
from
that
time
is
a
record
of
the
emergence
from
the
waters
of
larger
continents
and
the
formation
of
lofty
chains
of
mountains
now
this
battle
of
land
and
sea
has
been
waged
with
varying
fortune
from
age
to
age
and
it
has
been
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
the
development
of
life
we
are
just
beginning
to
realise
what
a
wonderful
light
it
throws
on
the
upward
advance
of
animals
and
plants
no
one
in
the
scientific
world
questions
that
however
imperfect
the
record
may
be
there
has
been
a
continuous
development
of
life
from
the
lowest
level
to
the
highest
but
why
there
was
advance
at
all
why
the
primitive
microbe
climbs
the
scale
of
being
during
millions
of
years
until
it
reaches
the
stature
of
humanity
seems
to
many
a
profound
mystery
the
solution
of
this
mystery
begins
to
break
upon
us
when
we
contemplate
in
the
geological
record
the
prolonged
series
of
changes
in
the
face
of
the
earth
itself
and
try
to
realise
how
these
changes
must
have
impelled
living
things
to
fresh
and
higher
adaptations
to
their
changing
surroundings
imagine
some
early
continent
with
its
population
of
animals
and
plants
each
bay
estuary
river
and
lake
each
forest
and
marsh
and
solid
plain
has
its
distinctive
inhabitants
imagine
this
continent
slowly
sinking
into
the
sea
until
the
advancing
arms
of
the
salt
water
meet
across
it
mingling
their
diverse
populations
in
a
common
world
making
the
lake
brackish
or
salt
turning
the
dry
land
into
swamp
and
flooding
the
forest
or
suppose
on
the
other
hand
that
the
land
rises
the
marsh
is
drained
the
genial
climate
succeeded
by
an
icy
cold
the
luscious
vegetation
destroyed
the
whole
animal
population
compelled
to
change
its
habits
and
its
food
but
this
is
no
imaginary
picture
it
is
the
actual
story
of
the
earth
during
millions
of
years
and
it
is
chiefly
in
the
light
of
these
vast
and
exacting
changes
in
the
environment
that
we
are
going
to
survey
the
panorama
of
the
advance
of
terrestrial
life
for
the
moment
it
will
be
enough
to
state
two
leading
principles
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
law
of
evolution
in
the
sense
in
which
many
people
understand
that
phrase
it
is
now
sufficiently
well
known
that
when
science
speaks
of
a
law
it
does
not
mean
that
there
is
some
rule
that
things
must
act
in
such
and
such
a
way
the
law
is
a
mere
general
expression
of
the
fact
that
they
do
act
in
that
way
but
many
imagine
that
there
is
some
principle
within
the
living
organism
which
impels
it
onward
to
a
higher
level
of
organisation
that
is
entirely
an
error
there
is
no
law
of
progress
if
an
animal
is
fitted
to
secure
its
livelihood
and
breed
posterity
in
certain
surroundings
it
may
remain
unchanged
indefinitely
if
these
surroundings
do
not
materially
change
so
the
duckmole
of
australia
and
the
tuatara
of
new
zealand
have
retained
primitive
features
for
millions
of
years
so
the
aboriginal
australian
and
the
fuegian
have
remained
stagnant
in
their
isolation
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
or
more
so
the
chinaman
in
his
geographical
isolation
has
remained
unchanged
for
two
thousand
years
there
is
no
more
a
conservative
instinct
in
chinese
than
there
is
a
progressive
instinct
in
europeans
the
difference
is
one
of
history
and
geography
as
we
shall
see
to
make
this
important
principle
still
clearer
let
us
imagine
some
primitive
philosopher
observing
the
advance
of
the
tide
over
a
level
beach
he
must
discover
two
things
why
the
water
comes
onward
at
all
and
why
it
advances
along
those
particular
channels
we
shall
see
later
how
men
of
science
explain
or
interpret
the
mechanism
in
a
living
thing
which
enables
it
to
advance
when
it
does
advance
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
say
that
animals
and
plants
are
always
tending
to
differ
somewhat
from
their
parents
and
we
now
know
by
experiment
that
when
some
exceptional
influence
is
brought
to
bear
on
the
parent
the
young
may
differ
considerably
from
her
but
if
the
parents
were
already
in
harmony
with
their
environment
these
variations
on
the
part
of
the
young
are
of
no
consequence
let
the
environment
alter
however
and
some
of
these
variations
may
chance
to
make
the
young
better
fitted
than
the
parent
was
the
young
which
happen
to
have
the
useful
variation
will
have
an
advantage
over
their
brothers
or
sisters
and
be
more
likely
to
survive
and
breed
the
next
generation
if
the
change
in
the
environment
in
the
food
or
climate
for
instance
is
prolonged
and
increased
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
we
shall
expect
to
find
a
corresponding
change
in
the
animals
and
plants
we
shall
find
such
changes
occurring
throughout
the
story
of
the
earth
at
one
important
point
in
the
story
we
shall
find
so
grave
a
revolution
in
the
face
of
nature
that
out
of
every
thirty
species
of
animals
and
plants
on
the
earth
are
annihilated
less
destructive
and
extreme
changes
have
been
taking
place
during
nearly
the
whole
of
the
period
we
have
to
cover
entailing
a
more
gradual
alteration
of
the
structure
of
animals
and
plants
but
we
shall
repeatedly
find
them
culminating
in
very
great
changes
of
climate
or
of
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
which
have
subjected
the
living
population
of
the
earth
to
the
most
searching
tests
and
promoted
every
variation
toward
a
more
effective
organisation
this
is
a
very
simple
expression
of
darwinism
and
will
be
enlarged
later
the
reader
should
ignore
the
occasional
statement
of
writers
that
darwinism
is
dead
or
superseded
the
questions
which
are
actually
in
dispute
relate
to
the
causes
of
the
variation
of
the
young
from
their
parents
the
magnitude
of
these
variations
and
the
transmission
of
changes
acquired
by
an
animal
during
its
own
life
we
shall
see
this
more
fully
at
a
later
stage
the
importance
of
the
environment
as
i
have
described
it
is
admitted
by
all
schools
and
the
second
guiding
principle
i
wish
to
lay
down
in
advance
is
that
these
great
changes
in
the
face
of
the
earth
which
explain
the
progress
of
organisms
may
very
largely
be
reduced
to
one
simple
agency
the
battle
of
the
land
and
the
sea
when
you
gaze
at
some
line
of
cliffs
that
is
being
eaten
away
by
the
waves
or
reflect
on
the
material
carried
out
to
sea
by
the
flooded
river
you
are
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
beholding
a
material
process
that
has
had
a
profound
influence
on
the
development
of
life
the
archaean
continent
that
we
described
was
being
reduced
constantly
by
the
wash
of
rain
the
scouring
of
rivers
and
the
fretting
of
the
waves
on
the
coast
it
is
generally
thought
that
these
wearing
agencies
were
more
violent
in
early
times
but
that
is
disputed
and
we
will
not
build
on
it
in
any
case
in
the
course
of
time
millions
of
tons
of
matter
were
scraped
off
the
archaean
continent
and
laid
on
the
floor
of
the
sea
by
its
rivers
this
meant
a
very
serious
alteration
of
pressure
or
weight
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
and
was
bound
to
entail
a
reaction
or
restoration
of
the
balance
the
rise
of
the
land
and
formation
of
mountains
used
to
be
ascribed
mainly
to
the
cooling
and
shrinking
of
the
globe
of
the
earth
the
skin
crust
it
was
thought
would
become
too
large
for
the
globe
as
it
shrank
and
would
wrinkle
outwards
or
pucker
up
into
the
position
of
our
greater
sprawling
across
half
the
earth
the
pyrenees
to
the
himalaya
and
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
andes
seems
to
confirm
this
but
the
question
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
is
obscure
and
disputed
and
geologists
generally
conceive
the
rise
of
land
and
formation
of
mountains
in
a
different
way
they
are
due
probably
to
the
alteration
of
pressure
on
the
crust
in
combination
with
the
instability
of
the
interior
the
floors
of
the
seas
would
sink
still
lower
under
their
colossal
burdens
and
this
would
cause
some
draining
of
the
at
the
same
time
the
heavy
pressure
below
the
seas
and
the
lessening
of
pressure
over
the
land
would
provoke
a
reaction
enormous
masses
of
rock
would
be
forced
toward
and
underneath
the
bending
crumpling
and
upheaving
it
as
if
its
crust
were
but
a
leather
coat
as
a
result
masses
of
land
would
slowly
rise
above
the
plain
to
be
shaped
into
hills
and
valleys
by
the
hand
of
later
time
and
fresh
surfaces
would
be
dragged
out
of
the
deep
enlarging
the
fringes
of
the
primitive
continents
to
be
warped
and
crumpled
in
their
turn
at
the
next
era
of
pressure
in
point
of
geological
fact
the
story
of
the
earth
has
been
one
prolonged
series
of
changes
in
the
level
of
land
and
water
and
in
their
respective
limits
these
changes
have
usually
been
very
gradual
but
they
have
always
entailed
changes
in
climate
of
the
greatest
significance
in
the
evolution
of
life
what
was
the
swampy
soil
of
england
in
the
carboniferous
period
is
now
sometimes
thousands
of
feet
beneath
us
and
what
was
the
floor
of
a
deep
ocean
over
much
of
europe
and
asia
at
another
time
is
now
to
be
found
on
the
slopes
of
lofty
alps
or
feet
above
the
in
thibet
our
story
of
terrestrial
life
will
be
to
a
great
extent
the
story
of
how
animals
and
plants
changed
their
structure
in
the
long
series
of
changes
which
this
endless
battle
of
land
and
sea
brought
over
the
face
of
the
earth
as
we
have
no
recognisable
remains
of
the
animals
and
plants
of
the
earliest
age
we
will
not
linger
over
the
archaean
rocks
starting
from
deep
and
obscure
masses
of
volcanic
matter
the
geologist
as
he
travels
up
the
series
of
archaean
rocks
can
trace
only
a
dim
and
most
unsatisfactory
picture
of
those
remote
times
between
outpours
of
volcanic
floods
he
finds
after
a
time
traces
that
an
ocean
and
rivers
are
wearing
away
the
land
he
finds
seams
of
carbon
among
the
rocks
of
the
second
division
of
the
archaean
the
keewatin
and
deduces
from
this
that
a
dense
population
already
covered
the
floor
of
the
ocean
in
the
next
division
the
huronian
he
finds
the
traces
of
extensive
strangely
lying
between
masses
of
volcanic
rock
and
sees
that
thousands
of
square
miles
of
eastern
north
america
were
then
covered
with
an
then
fresh
floods
of
molten
matter
are
poured
out
from
the
depths
below
then
the
sea
floods
the
land
for
a
time
and
at
last
it
makes
its
final
emergence
as
the
first
definitive
part
of
the
north
american
continent
to
enlarge
by
successive
fringes
to
the
continent
of
i
am
quoting
professor
coleman
summary
of
archaean
research
in
north
america
address
to
the
geological
section
of
the
british
association
europe
as
a
continent
has
had
more
ups
and
downs
than
america
in
the
course
of
geological
time
this
meagre
picture
of
the
battle
of
land
and
sea
with
interludes
of
great
volcanic
activity
and
even
of
an
ice
age
represents
nearly
all
we
know
of
the
first
half
of
the
world
story
from
geology
it
is
especially
disappointing
in
regard
to
the
living
population
the
very
few
fossils
we
find
in
the
upper
archaean
rocks
are
so
similar
to
those
we
shall
discuss
in
the
next
chapter
that
we
may
disregard
them
and
the
seams
of
and
limestone
suggest
only
at
the
most
that
life
was
already
abundant
we
must
turn
elsewhere
for
some
information
on
the
origin
and
early
development
of
life
the
question
of
the
origin
of
life
i
will
dismiss
with
a
brief
account
of
the
various
speculations
of
recent
students
of
science
broadly
speaking
their
views
fall
into
three
classes
some
think
that
the
germs
of
life
may
have
come
to
the
earth
from
some
other
body
in
the
universe
some
think
that
life
was
evolved
out
of
matter
in
the
early
ages
of
the
earth
under
exceptional
conditions
which
we
do
not
at
present
know
or
can
only
dimly
conjecture
and
some
think
that
life
is
being
evolved
from
in
nature
and
always
has
been
so
evolving
the
majority
of
scientific
men
merely
assume
that
the
earliest
living
things
were
no
exception
to
the
general
process
of
evolution
but
think
that
we
have
too
little
positive
knowledge
to
speculate
profitably
on
the
manner
of
their
origin
the
first
view
that
the
germs
of
life
may
have
come
to
this
planet
on
a
meteoric
visitor
from
some
other
world
as
a
bird
may
take
its
parasites
to
some
distant
island
is
not
without
adherents
it
was
put
forward
long
ago
by
lord
kelvin
and
others
it
has
been
revived
by
the
distinguished
swede
professor
svante
arrhenius
the
scientific
objection
to
it
is
that
the
more
intense
rays
of
the
sun
would
frill
such
germs
as
they
pass
through
space
but
a
broader
objection
and
one
that
may
dispense
us
from
dwelling
on
it
is
that
we
gain
nothing
by
throwing
our
problems
upon
another
planet
we
have
no
ground
for
supposing
that
the
earth
is
less
capable
of
evolving
life
than
other
planets
the
second
view
is
that
when
the
earth
had
passed
through
its
stage
great
masses
of
very
complex
chemicals
produced
by
the
great
heat
were
found
on
its
surface
there
is
one
complex
chemical
substance
in
particular
called
cyanogen
which
is
either
an
important
constituent
of
living
matter
or
closely
akin
to
it
now
we
need
intense
heat
to
produce
this
substance
in
the
laboratory
may
we
not
suppose
that
masses
of
it
were
produced
during
the
incandescence
of
the
earth
and
that
when
the
waters
descended
they
passed
through
a
series
of
changes
which
culminated
in
living
plasm
such
is
the
cyanogen
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
life
advocated
by
able
physiologists
such
as
pfluger
verworn
and
others
it
has
the
merit
of
suggesting
a
reason
why
life
may
not
be
evolving
from
in
nature
although
it
may
have
so
evolved
in
the
archaean
period
other
students
suggest
other
combinations
of
and
water
in
the
early
days
some
suggest
that
electric
action
was
probably
far
more
intense
in
those
ages
others
think
that
quantities
of
radium
may
have
been
left
at
the
surface
but
the
most
important
of
these
speculations
on
the
origin
of
life
in
early
times
and
one
that
has
the
merit
of
not
assuming
any
essentially
different
conditions
then
than
we
find
now
is
contained
in
a
recent
pronouncement
of
one
of
the
greatest
organic
chemists
in
europe
professor
armstrong
he
says
that
such
great
progress
has
been
made
in
his
science
the
science
of
the
chemical
processes
in
living
things
that
their
cryptic
character
seems
to
have
disappeared
almost
suddenly
on
the
strength
of
this
new
knowledge
of
living
matter
he
ventures
to
say
that
a
series
of
lucky
accidents
could
account
for
the
first
formation
of
living
things
out
of
matter
in
archaean
times
indeed
he
goes
further
he
names
certain
inorganic
substances
and
says
that
the
blowing
of
these
into
pools
by
the
wind
on
the
primitive
planet
would
set
afoot
chemical
combinations
which
would
issue
in
the
production
of
living
matter

burke
origin
of
life
and
bastian
origin
of
life
it
is
evident
that
the
popular
notion
that
scientific
men
have
declared
that
life
can
not
be
evolved
from
is
very
far
astray
this
blunder
is
usually
due
to
a
misunderstanding
of
the
dogmatic
statement
which
one
often
reads
in
scientific
works
that
every
living
thing
comes
from
a
living
thing
this
principle
has
no
reference
to
remote
ages
when
the
conditions
may
have
been
different
it
means
that
within
our
experience
the
living
thing
is
always
born
of
a
living
parent
however
even
this
is
questioned
by
some
scientific
men
of
eminence
and
we
come
to
the
third
view
professor
nageli
a
distinguished
botanist
and
professor
haeckel
maintain
that
our
experience
as
well
as
the
range
of
our
microscopes
is
too
limited
to
justify
the
current
axiom
they
believe
that
life
may
be
evolving
constantly
from
inorganic
matter
professor
j
thomson
also
warns
us
that
our
experience
is
very
limited
and
for
all
we
know
protoplasm
may
be
forming
naturally
in
our
own
time
butler
burke
has
under
the
action
of
radium
caused
the
birth
of
certain
minute
specks
which
strangely
imitate
the
behaviour
of
bacteria
bastian
has
maintained
for
years
that
he
has
produced
living
things
from
matter
in
his
latest
experiments
described
in
the
book
quoted
purely
inorganic
matter
is
used
and
it
is
previously
subjected
in
hermetically
sealed
tubes
to
a
heat
greater
than
what
has
been
found
necessary
to
kill
any
germs
whatever
evidently
the
problem
of
the
origin
of
life
is
not
hopeless
but
our
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
living
matter
is
still
so
imperfect
that
we
may
leave
detailed
speculation
on
its
origin
to
a
future
generation
organic
chemistry
is
making
such
strides
that
the
day
may
not
be
far
distant
when
living
matter
will
be
made
by
the
chemist
and
the
secret
of
its
origin
revealed
for
the
present
we
must
be
content
to
choose
the
more
plausible
of
the
speculations
on
the
subject
but
while
the
origin
of
life
is
obscure
the
early
stages
of
its
evolution
come
fairly
within
the
range
of
our
knowledge
to
the
inexpert
it
must
seem
strange
that
whereas
we
must
rely
on
pure
speculation
in
attempting
to
trace
the
origin
of
life
we
can
speak
with
more
confidence
of
those
early
developments
of
plants
and
animals
which
are
equally
buried
in
the
mists
of
the
archaean
period
have
we
not
said
that
nothing
remains
of
the
procession
of
organisms
during
half
the
earth
story
but
a
shapeless
seam
of
carbon
or
limestone
a
simple
illustration
will
serve
to
justify
the
procedure
we
are
about
to
adopt
suppose
that
the
whole
of
our
literary
and
pictorial
references
to
earlier
stages
in
the
development
of
the
bicycle
the
locomotive
or
the
loom
were
destroyed
we
should
still
be
able
to
retrace
the
phases
of
their
evolution
because
we
should
discover
specimens
belonging
to
those
early
phases
lingering
in
our
museums
in
backward
regions
and
elsewhere
they
might
yet
be
useful
in
certain
environments
into
which
the
higher
machines
have
not
penetrated
in
the
same
way
if
all
the
remains
of
prehistoric
man
and
early
civilisation
were
lost
we
could
still
fairly
retrace
the
steps
of
the
human
race
by
gathering
the
lower
tribes
and
races
and
arranging
them
in
the
order
of
their
advancement
they
are
so
many
surviving
illustrations
of
the
stages
through
which
mankind
as
a
whole
has
passed
just
in
the
same
way
we
may
marshal
the
countless
species
of
animals
and
plants
in
such
order
that
they
will
in
a
general
way
exhibit
to
us
the
procession
of
life
from
the
very
start
of
living
evolution
certain
forms
dropped
out
of
the
onward
march
and
have
remained
to
our
great
instruction
what
their
ancestors
were
millions
of
years
ago
people
create
a
difficulty
for
themselves
by
imagining
that
if
evolution
is
true
all
animals
must
evolve
a
glance
at
our
own
fellows
will
show
the
error
of
this
of
one
family
of
human
beings
as
a
french
writer
has
said
one
only
becomes
a
napoleon
the
others
remain
lucien
jerome
or
joseph
of
one
family
of
animals
or
trees
some
advance
in
one
or
other
direction
some
remain
at
the
original
level
there
is
no
law
of
progress
the
accidents
of
the
world
and
hereditary
endowment
impel
some
onward
and
do
not
impel
others
hence
at
nearly
every
great
stage
in
the
upward
procession
through
the
ages
some
regiment
of
plants
or
animals
has
dropped
out
and
it
represents
the
stage
of
life
at
which
it
ceased
to
progress
in
other
words
when
we
survey
the
line
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
species
which
we
find
in
nature
we
can
trace
amid
their
countless
variations
and
branches
the
line
of
organic
evolution
in
the
past
just
as
we
could
from
actual
instances
study
the
evolution
of
a
british
house
from
the
prehistoric
remains
in
devonshire
to
a
mansion
in
park
lane
or
a
provincial
castle
another
method
of
retracing
the
lost
early
chapters
in
the
development
of
life
is
furnished
by
embryology
the
value
of
this
method
is
not
recognised
by
all
embryologists
but
there
are
now
few
authorities
who
question
the
substantial
correctness
of
it
and
we
shall
as
we
proceed
see
some
remarkable
applications
of
it
in
brief
it
is
generally
admitted
that
an
animal
or
plant
is
apt
to
reproduce
during
its
embryonic
development
some
of
the
stages
of
its
ancestry
in
past
time
this
does
not
mean
that
a
higher
animal
whose
ancestors
were
at
one
time
worms
at
another
time
fishes
and
at
a
later
time
reptiles
will
successively
take
the
form
of
a
little
worm
a
little
fish
and
a
little
reptile
the
embryonic
life
itself
has
been
subject
to
evolution
and
this
reproduction
of
ancestral
forms
has
been
proportionately
disturbed
still
we
shall
find
that
animals
will
tend
in
their
embryonic
development
to
reproduce
various
structural
features
which
can
only
be
understood
as
reminiscences
of
ancestral
organs
in
the
lower
animals
the
reproduction
is
much
less
disturbed
than
in
the
higher
but
even
in
the
case
of
man
this
law
is
most
strikingly
verified
we
shall
find
it
useful
sometimes
at
least
in
confirming
our
conclusions
as
to
the
ancestry
of
a
particular
group
we
have
therefore
two
important
clues
to
the
missing
chapters
in
the
story
of
evolution
just
as
the
scheme
of
the
evolution
of
worlds
is
written
broadly
across
the
face
of
the
heavens
so
the
scheme
of
the
evolution
of
life
is
written
on
the
face
of
living
nature
and
it
is
written
again
in
blurred
and
broken
characters
in
the
embryonic
development
of
each
individual
with
these
aids
we
set
out
to
restore
the
lost
beginning
of
the
epic
of
organic
evolution
chapter
vi
the
infancy
of
the
earth
the
long
archaean
period
into
which
half
the
story
of
the
earth
is
so
unsatisfactorily
packed
came
to
a
close
with
a
considerable
uplift
of
the
land
we
have
seen
that
the
earth
at
times
reaches
critical
stages
owing
to
the
transfer
of
millions
of
tons
of
matter
from
the
land
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
and
the
need
to
readjust
the
pressure
on
the
crust
apparently
this
stage
is
reached
at
the
end
of
the
archaean
and
a
great
rise
of
the
land
probably
protracted
during
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
takes
place
the
round
the
primitive
continent
are
raised
above
the
water
their
rocks
crumpling
like
plates
of
lead
under
the
overpowering
pressure
the
sea
retires
with
its
inhabitants
mingling
their
various
provinces
transforming
their
settled
homes
a
larger
continent
spans
the
northern
ocean
of
the
earth
in
the
of
this
early
continent
are
myriads
of
living
things
representing
all
the
great
families
of
the
animal
world
below
the
level
of
the
fish
and
the
insect
the
mud
and
sand
in
which
their
frames
are
entombed
as
they
die
will
one
day
be
the
cambrian
rocks
of
the
geologist
and
reveal
to
him
their
forms
and
suggest
their
habits
no
great
volcanic
age
will
reduce
them
to
streaks
of
shapeless
carbon
the
earth
now
buries
its
dead
and
from
their
petrified
remains
we
conjure
up
a
picture
of
the
swarming
life
of
the
cambrian
ocean
a
strange
sluggish
population
burrows
in
the
mud
crawls
over
the
sand
adheres
to
the
rocks
and
swims
among
the
thickets
of
the
strangest
and
most
formidable
though
still
too
puny
a
thing
to
survive
in
a
more
strenuous
age
is
the
familiar
trilobite
of
the
geological
museum
a
flattish
animal
with
broad
round
head
like
a
shovel
its
back
covered
with
a
shell
and
a
number
of
fine
legs
or
swimmers
below
it
burrows
in
the
loose
bottom
or
lies
in
it
with
its
large
compound
eyes
peeping
out
in
search
of
prey
it
is
the
chief
representative
of
the
group
crustacea
which
will
later
replace
it
with
the
lobster
the
shrimp
the
crab
and
the
its
remains
form
from
a
third
to
a
fourth
of
all
the
buried
cambrian
skeletons
with
it
swimming
in
the
water
are
smaller
members
of
the
same
family
which
come
nearer
to
our
familiar
small
crustacea
are
the
next
most
conspicuous
inhabitants
molluscs
are
already
well
represented
but
the
more
numerous
are
the
more
elementary
brachiopods
lampshells
which
come
next
to
the
trilobites
in
number
and
variety
worms
or
annelids
wind
in
and
out
of
the
mud
leaving
their
tracks
and
tubes
for
later
ages
strange
ball
or
little
animals
with
a
hard
frame
mounted
on
stony
stalks
and
waving
irregular
arms
to
draw
in
the
water
are
the
earliest
representatives
of
the
echinoderms
some
of
these
cystids
will
presently
blossom
into
the
wonderful
population
of
the
next
age
some
are
already
quitting
their
stalks
to
become
the
of
which
a
primitive
specimen
has
been
found
in
the
later
cambrian
large
of
which
casts
are
preserved
swim
in
the
water

their
rocky
foundations
but
do
not
as
yet
form
reefs
coarse
sponges
rise
from
the
floor
and
myriads
of
tiny
radiolaria
and
thalamophores
with
shells
of
flint
and
lime
float
at
the
surface
or
at
various
depths
this
slight
sketch
of
the
cambrian
population
shows
us
that
living
things
had
already
reached
a
high
level
of
development
their
story
evidently
goes
back
for
millions
of
years
deep
into
those
mists
of
the
archaean
age
which
we
were
unable
to
penetrate
we
turn
therefore
to
the
zoologist
to
learn
what
he
can
tell
us
of
the
origin
and
of
these
cambrian
animals
and
will
afterwards
see
how
they
are
climbing
to
higher
levels
under
the
eye
of
the
geologist
at
the
basis
of
the
living
world
of
is
a
vast
population
of
minute
generally
microscopic
animals
and
plants
which
are
popularly
known
as
microbes
each
consists
in
scientific
language
of
one
cell
it
is
now
well
known
that
the
bodies
of
the
larger
animals
and
plants
are
made
up
of
millions
of
these
units
of
living
matter
or
cells
the
atoms
of
the
organic
world
and
i
need
not
enlarge
on
it
but
even
a
single
cell
lends
itself
to
infinite
variety
of
shape
and
we
have
to
penetrate
to
the
very
lowest
level
of
this
luxuriant
world
of
organisms
to
obtain
some
idea
of
the
most
primitive
living
things
properly
speaking
there
were
no
first
living
things
it
can
not
be
doubted
by
any
student
of
nature
that
the
microbe
developed
so
gradually
that
it
is
as
impossible
to
fix
a
precise
term
for
the
beginning
of
life
as
it
is
to
say
when
the
night
ends
and
the
day
begins
in
the
course
of
time
little
living
units
appeared
in
the
waters
of
the
earth
whether
in
the
shallow
shore
waters
or
on
the
surface
of
the
deep
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
we
are
justified
in
concluding
that
they
were
at
least
as
rudimentary
in
structure
and
life
as
the
lowest
inhabitants
of
nature
the
distinction
of
being
the
lowest
known
living
organisms
should
i
think
be
awarded
to
certain
vegetal
organisms
which
are
very
common
in
nature
minute
simple
specks
of
living
matter
sometimes
less
than
the
of
an
inch
in
diameter
these
lowly
algae
are
so
numerous
that
it
is
they
in
their
millions
which
cover
moist
surfaces
with
the
familiar
greenish
or
bluish
coat
they
have
no
visible
organisation
though
naturally
they
must
have
some
kind
of
structure
below
the
range
of
the
microscope
their
life
consists
in
the
absorption
of
at
any
point
of
their
surface
and
in
dividing
into
two
living
microbes
instead
of
dying
when
their
bulk
increases
a
very
lowly
branch
of
the
bacteria
nitrobacteria
sometimes
dispute
their
claim
to
the
lowest
position
in
the
hierarchy
of
living
nature
but
there
is
reason
to
suspect
that
these
bacteria
may
have
degenerated
from
a
higher
level
here
we
have
a
convenient
for
the
story
of
life
and
may
now
trace
the
general
lines
of
upward
development
the
first
great
principle
to
be
recognised
is
the
early
division
of
these
primitive
organisms
into
two
great
classes
the
moving
and
the
stationary
the
clue
to
this
important
divergence
is
found
in
diet
with
exceptions
on
both
sides
we
find
that
the
microbes
generally
feed
on
inorganic
matter
which
they
convert
into
plasm
the
moving
microbes
generally
feed
on
plasm
on
the
living
on
each
other
or
on
particles
of
dead
organic
matter
now
inorganic
food
is
generally
diffused
in
the
waters
so
that
the
vegetal
feeders
have
no
incentive
to
develop
mobility
on
the
other
hand
the
power
to
move
in
search
of
their
food
which
is
not
equally
diffused
becomes
a
most
important
advantage
to
the
feeders
on
other
organisms
they
therefore
develop
various
means
of
locomotion
some
flow
or
roll
slowly
along
like
tiny
drops
of
oil
on
an
inclined
surface
others
develop
minute
outgrowths
of
their
substance
like
fine
hairs
which
beat
the
water
as
oars
do
some
of
them
have
one
strong
oar
like
the
gondolier
but
in
front
of
the
boat
others
have
two
or
more
oars
while
some
have
their
little
flanks
bristling
with
fine
lashes
like
the
flanks
of
a
roman
galley
if
we
imagine
this
simple
principle
at
work
for
ages
among
the
primitive
microbes
we
understand
the
first
great
division
of
the
living
world
into
plants
and
animals
there
must
have
been
a
long
series
of
earlier
stages
below
the
plant
and
animal
in
fact
some
writers
insist
that
the
first
organisms
were
animal
in
nature
feeding
on
the
more
elementary
stages
of
living
matter
at
last
one
type
develops
chlorophyll
the
green
matter
in
leaves
and
is
able
to
build
up
plasm
out
of
inorganic
matter
another
type
develops
mobility
and
becomes
a
parasite
on
the
plant
world
there
is
no
rigid
distinction
of
the
two
worlds
many
microscopic
plants
move
about
just
as
animals
do
and
many
animals
live
on
fixed
stalks
while
many
plants
feed
on
organic
matter
there
is
so
little
difference
of
nature
between
the
plant
and
the
animal
that
the
experts
differ
in
classifying
some
of
these
minute
creatures
in
fact
we
shall
often
find
plants
and
animals
crossing
the
line
of
division
we
shall
find
animals
rooting
themselves
to
the
floor
like
plants
though
they
will
generally
develop
arms
or
streamers
for
bringing
the
food
to
them
and
we
shall
find
plants
becoming
all
this
merely
shows
that
the
difference
is
a
natural
tendency
which
special
circumstances
may
overrule
it
remains
true
that
the
great
division
of
the
organic
world
is
due
to
a
simple
principle
of
development
difference
of
diet
leads
to
difference
of
mobility
but
this
simple
principle
will
have
further
consequences
of
a
most
important
character
it
will
lead
to
the
development
of
mind
in
one
half
of
living
nature
and
leave
it
undeveloped
in
the
other
mind
as
we
know
it
in
the
lower
levels
of
life
is
not
confined
to
the
animal
at
all
many
even
of
the
higher
plants
are
very
delicately
sensitive
to
stimulation
and
at
the
lowest
level
many
plants
behave
just
like
animals
in
other
words
this
sensitiveness
to
stimuli
which
is
the
first
form
of
mind
is
distributed
according
to
mobility
to
the
motionless
organism
it
is
no
advantage
to
the
pursuing
and
pursued
organism
it
is
an
immense
advantage
and
is
one
of
the
chief
qualities
for
natural
selection
to
foster
for
the
moment
however
we
must
glance
at
the
operation
of
this
and
other
natural
principles
in
the
evolution
of
the
animals
and
plants
which
we
take
to
represent
the
primitive
population
of
the
earth
as
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
different
species
even
of
microbes
it
is
clear
that
we
must
deal
with
them
in
a
very
summary
way
the
evolution
of
the
plant
i
reserve
for
a
later
chapter
and
i
must
be
content
to
suggest
the
development
of
animals
on
very
broad
lines
when
some
of
the
primitive
cells
began
to
feed
on
each
other
and
develop
mobility
it
is
probable
that
at
least
two
distinct
types
were
evolved
corresponding
to
the
two
lowest
animal
organisms
in
nature
one
of
these
is
a
very
minute
and
very
common
in
vases
of
decaying
flowers
for
instance
speck
of
plasm
which
moves
about
by
lashing
the
water
with
a
single
oar
flagellum
or
extension
of
its
substance
this
type
however
which
is
known
as
the
flagellate
may
be
derived
from
the
next
which
we
will
take
as
the
primitive
and
fundamental
animal
type
it
is
best
seen
in
the
common
and
familiar
amoeba
a
minute
sac
of
liquid
or
viscid
plasm
often
not
more
than
a
hundredth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
as
its
skin
is
merely
a
finer
kind
of
the
viscous
plasm
not
an
impenetrable
membrane
it
takes
in
food
at
any
part
of
its
surface
makes
little
stomachs
or
temporary
cavities
round
the
food
at
any
part
of
its
interior
ejects
the
useless
matter
at
any
point
and
thrusts
out
any
part
of
its
body
as
temporary
arms
or
feet
now
it
is
plain
that
in
an
age
of
increasing
microbic
cannibalism
the
toughening
of
the
skin
would
be
one
of
the
first
advantages
to
secure
survival
and
this
is
in
point
of
fact
almost
the
second
leading
principle
in
early
development
naturally
as
the
skin
becomes
firmer
the
animal
can
no
longer
like
the
amoeba
take
food
at
or
make
limbs
of
any
part
of
it
there
must
be
permanent
pores
in
the
membrane
to
receive
food
or
let
out
rays
of
the
living
substance
to
act
as
oars
or
arms
thus
we
get
an
immense
variety
amongst
these
protozoa
as
the
animals
are
called
some
the
flagellates
have
one
or
two
stout
oars
some
the
ciliates
have
numbers
of
fine
hairs
or
cilia
some
have
a
definite
but
no
stomach
and
cilia
drawing
the
water
into
it
some
vorticella
etc
shrinking
from
the
open
battlefield
return
to
the
live
on
stalks
and
have
wreaths
of
cilia
round
the
open
mouth
drawing
the
water
to
them
some
the
heliozoa
remain
almost
motionless
shooting
out
sticky
rays
of
their
matter
on
every
side
to
catch
the
food
some
form
tubes
to
live
in
some
coleps
develop
horny
plates
for
armour
and
others
develop
projectiles
to
pierce
their
prey
stinging
threads
this
miniature
world
is
full
of
evolutionary
interest
but
it
is
too
vast
for
detailed
study
here
we
will
take
one
group
which
we
know
to
have
been
already
developed
in
the
cambrian
and
let
a
study
of
its
development
stand
for
all
in
every
lecture
or
book
on
the
beauties
of
the
microscope
we
find
and
are
generally
greatly
puzzled
by
minute
shells
of
remarkable
grace
and
beauty
that
are
formed
by
some
of
these
very
elementary
animals
they
are
the
radiolaria
with
flinty
shells
as
a
rule
and
the
thalamophora
with
chalk
frames
evolution
furnishes
a
simple
key
to
their
remarkable
structure
as
we
saw
one
of
the
early
requirements
to
be
fostered
by
natural
selection
in
the
archaean
struggle
for
life
was
a
thick
skin
and
the
thick
skin
had
to
be
porous
to
let
the
animal
shoot
out
its
viscid
substance
in
rays
and
earn
its
living
this
stage
above
the
amoeba
is
beautifully
illustrated
in
the
heliozoa
now
the
lowest
types
of
radiolaria
are
of
this
character
they
have
no
shell
or
framework
at
all
the
next
stage
is
for
the
little
animal
to
develop
fine
irregular
threads
of
flint
in
its
skin
a
much
better
security
against
the
these
animalcules
it
must
be
recollected
are
bits
of
almost
pure
plasm
and
as
they
live
in
crowds
dividing
and
subdividing
but
never
dying
make
excellent
mouthfuls
for
a
small
feeder
those
with
the
more
flint
in
their
skins
were
the
more
apt
to
survive
and
breed
the
threads
of
flint
increase
until
they
form
a
sort
of
round
a
little
social
group
or
a
complete
lattice
round
an
individual
body
next
spikes
or
spines
jut
out
from
the
lattice
partly
for
additional
protection
partly
to
keep
the
little
body
afloat
at
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
this
way
we
get
a
bewildering
variety
and
increasing
complexity
of
forms
ascending
in
four
divergent
lines
from
the
naked
ancestral
type
to
the
extreme
grace
and
intricacy
of
the
calocyclas
monumentum
or
the
lychnaspis
miranda
these
however
are
rare
specimens
in
the
species
of
radiolaria
i
have
hundreds
of
them
on
microscopic
slides
which
have
no
beauty
and
little
regularity
of
form
we
see
a
gradual
evolution
on
utilitarian
principles
as
we
run
over
the
thousands
of
forms
and
when
we
recollect
the
inconceivable
numbers
in
which
these
little
animals
have
lived
and
struggled
for
life
passively
during
tens
of
millions
of
years
we
are
not
surprised
at
the
elaborate
protective
frames
of
the
higher
types
the
thalamophores
the
of
animals
which
largely
compose
our
chalk
and
much
of
our
limestone
are
developed
on
the
same
principle
the
earlier
forms
seem
to
have
lived
in
a
part
of
the
ocean
where
silica
was
scarce
and
they
absorbed
and
built
their
protective
frames
of
lime
in
the
simpler
types
the
frame
is
not
unlike
a
bottle
turned
in
later
forms
it
takes
the
shape
of
a
spirally
coiled
series
of
chambers
sometimes
amounting
to
several
thousand
these
wonderful
little
houses
are
not
difficult
to
understand
the
original
tiny
animal
covers
itself
with
a
coat
of
lime
it
feeds
grows
and
bulges
out
of
its
chamber
the
new
part
of
its
flesh
must
have
a
fresh
coat
and
the
process
goes
on
until
scores
or
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
these
tiny
chambers
make
up
the
spiral
shell
of
the
morsel
of
living
matter
with
this
brief
indication
of
the
mechanical
principles
which
have
directed
the
evolution
of
two
of
the
most
remarkable
groups
of
the
animals
we
must
be
content
or
the
dimensions
of
this
volume
will
not
enable
us
even
to
reach
the
higher
and
more
interesting
types
we
must
advance
at
once
to
the
larger
animals
whose
bodies
are
composed
of
myriads
of
cells
the
social
tendency
which
pervades
the
animal
world
and
the
evident
use
of
that
tendency
prepare
us
to
understand
that
the
primitive
microbes
would
naturally
come
in
time
to
live
in
clusters
union
means
effectiveness
in
many
ways
even
when
it
does
not
mean
strength
we
have
still
many
loose
associations
of
animals
in
nature
illustrating
the
approach
to
a
community
life
numbers
of
the
protozoa
are
social
they
live
either
in
a
common
matrix
or
on
a
common
stalk
in
fact
we
have
a
singularly
instructive
illustration
of
the
process
in
the
evolution
of
the
sponges
it
is
well
known
that
the
horny
texture
to
which
we
commonly
give
the
name
of
sponge
is
the
former
tenement
and
shelter
of
a
colony
of
animals
which
are
the
real
sponges
in
other
groups
the
structure
is
of
lime
in
others
again
of
flinty
material
now
the
sponges
as
we
have
them
are
so
varied
and
start
from
so
low
a
level
that
no
other
group
of
animals
illustrates
so
strikingly
the
theory
of
evolution
as
professor
minchin
says
we
begin
with
colonies
in
which
the
individuals
are
as
in
proterospongia
irregularly
distributed
in
their
common
bed
each
animal
lashing
the
water
as
stalked
flagellates
do
and
bringing
the
food
to
it
such
a
colony
would
be
admirable
food
for
an
early
carnivore
and
we
soon
find
the
protective
principle
making
it
less
pleasant
for
the
devourer
the
first
stage
may
be
at
least
there
are
such
sponges
even
now
that
the
common
bed
is
strewn
or
sown
with
the
cast
shells
of
radiolaria
however
that
may
be
the
sponges
soon
begin
to
absorb
the
silica
or
lime
of
the
and
deposit
it
in
needles
or
fragments
in
their
bed
the
deposit
goes
on
until
at
last
an
elaborate
framework
of
thorny
or
limy
or
flinty
material
is
constructed
by
the
citizens
in
the
higher
types
a
system
of
pores
or
canals
lets
the
water
pass
through
as
the
animals
draw
it
in
with
their
lashes
in
the
highest
types
the
animals
come
still
closer
together
lining
the
walls
of
little
chambers
in
the
interior
here
we
have
a
very
clear
evolutionary
transition
from
the
solitary
microbe
to
a
higher
level
but
unfortunately
it
does
not
take
us
far
the
sponges
are
a
or
cul
de
sac
from
the
protozoic
world
and
do
not
lead
on
to
the
higher
each
unit
remains
an
animal
it
is
a
colony
of
unicellulars
not
a
body
we
may
admire
it
as
an
instructive
approach
toward
the
formation
of
a
body
but
we
must
look
elsewhere
for
the
true
upward
advance
the
next
stage
is
best
illustrated
in
certain
spherical
colonies
of
cells
like
the
tiny
green
volvox
now
generally
regarded
as
vegetal
of
our
ponds
or
magosphoera
here
the
constituent
cells
merge
their
individuality
in
the
common
action
we
have
the
first
definite
body
it
is
the
type
to
which
a
moving
close
colony
of
microbes
would
soon
come
the
round
surface
is
well
adapted
for
rolling
or
spinning
along
in
the
water
and
as
each
little
cell
earns
its
own
living
it
must
be
at
the
surface
in
contact
with
the
water
thus
a
hollow
or
little
sphere
like
the
volvox
is
the
natural
between
the
microbe
and
the
body
and
may
be
taken
to
represent
the
first
important
stage
in
its
development
the
next
important
stage
is
also
very
clearly
exhibited
in
nature
and
is
more
or
less
clearly
reproduced
in
the
embryonic
development
of
all
animals
we
may
imagine
that
the
age
of
microbes
was
succeeded
by
an
age
of
these
larger
bodies
and
the
struggle
for
life
entered
upon
a
new
phase
the
great
principle
we
have
already
recognised
came
into
play
once
more
large
numbers
of
the
bodies
shrank
from
the
field
of
battle
and
adopted
the
method
of
the
plant
they
rooted
themselves
to
the
floor
of
the
ocean
and
developed
long
arms
or
lashes
for
creating
a
whirlpool
movement
in
the
water
and
thus
bringing
the
food
into
their
open
mouths
forfeiting
mobility
they
have
like
the
plant
forfeited
the
greater
possibilities
of
progress
and
they
remain
flowering
on
the
floors
of
our
waters
recalling
the
next
phase
in
the
evolution
of
early
life
such
are
the
hydra
the
polyp
the
coral
and
the
it
is
not
singular
that
earlier
observers
could
not
detect
that
they
were
animals
and
they
were
long
known
in
science
as
zoophytes
when
we
look
to
the
common
structure
of
these
animals
to
find
the
ancestral
type
we
must
ignore
the
nerve
and
which
they
have
developed
in
some
degree
fundamentally
their
body
consists
of
a
pouch
with
an
open
mouth
the
sides
of
the
pouch
consisting
of
a
double
layer
of
cells
in
this
we
have
a
clue
to
the
next
stage
of
animal
development
take
a
soft
ball
to
represent
the
first
animal
press
in
one
half
of
the
ball
close
upon
the
other
narrow
the
mouth
and
you
have
something
like
the
of
the
coral
and
hydra
as
this
is
the
course
of
embryonic
development
and
as
it
is
so
well
retained
in
the
lowest
groups
of
the
animals
we
take
it
to
be
the
next
stage
the
reason
for
it
will
become
clear
on
reflection
division
of
labour
naturally
takes
place
in
a
colony
and
in
that
way
certain
cells
in
the
primitive
body
were
confined
to
the
work
of
digestion
it
would
be
an
obvious
advantage
for
these
to
retire
into
the
interior
leaving
the
whole
external
surface
free
for
the
adjustment
of
the
animal
relations
to
the
outer
world
again
we
must
refrain
from
following
in
detail
the
development
of
this
new
world
of
life
which
branches
off
in
the
archaean
ocean
the
evolution
of
the
corals
alone
would
be
a
lengthy
and
interesting
story
but
a
word
must
be
said
about
the
partly
because
the
inexpert
will
be
puzzled
at
the
inclusion
of
so
active
an
animal
and
partly
because
its
story
admirably
illustrates
the
principle
we
are
studying
the
medusa
really
descends
from
one
of
the
animals
of
the
early
archaean
period
but
it
has
abandoned
the
ancestral
stalk
turned
upside
down
and
developed
muscular
swimming
organs
its
past
is
betrayed
in
its
embryonic
development
as
a
rule
the
germ
develops
into
a
stalked
polyp
out
of
which
the
medusa
is
formed
this
return
to
active
and
free
life
must
have
occurred
early
as
we
find
casts
of
large
medusae
in
the
cambrian
beds
in
complete
harmony
with
the
principle
we
laid
down
the
has
gained
in
nerve
and
sensitiveness
in
proportion
to
its
return
to
an
active
career
but
this
principle
is
best
illustrated
in
the
other
branch
of
the
early
animals
which
continued
to
move
about
in
search
of
food
here
as
will
be
expected
we
have
the
main
stem
of
the
animal
world
and
although
the
successive
stages
of
development
are
obscure
certain
broad
lines
that
it
followed
are
clear
and
interesting
it
is
evident
that
in
a
swarming
population
of
such
animals
the
most
valuable
qualities
will
be
speed
and
perception
the
sluggish
coral
needs
only
sensitiveness
enough
and
mobility
enough
to
shrink
behind
its
protecting
scales
at
the
approach
of
danger
in
the
open
water
the
most
speedy
and
most
sensitive
will
be
apt
to
escape
destruction
and
have
the
larger
share
in
breeding
the
next
generation
imagine
a
selection
on
this
principle
going
on
for
millions
of
years
and
the
general
result
can
be
conjectured
a
very
interesting
analogy
is
found
in
the
evolution
of
the
boat
from
the
clumsy
hollowed
tree
of
neolithic
man
natural
selection
or
the
need
of
increasing
speed
has
developed
the
elongated
evenly
balanced
modern
boat
with
its
distinct
stem
and
stern
so
in
the
archaean
ocean
the
struggle
to
overtake
food
or
escape
feeders
evolved
an
elongated
body
with
head
and
tail
and
with
the
oars
cilia
of
the
ancestor
spread
thickly
along
its
flanks
in
other
words
a
body
akin
to
that
of
the
lower
would
be
the
natural
result
and
this
is
in
point
of
fact
the
next
stage
we
find
in
the
hierarchy
of
living
nature
probably
myriads
of
different
types
of
this
organisation
were
developed
but
such
animals
leave
no
trace
in
the
rocks
and
we
can
only
follow
the
development
by
broad
analogies
the
lowest
of
may
represent
some
of
these
early
types
and
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
what
is
loosely
called
worm
organisation
we
get
some
instructive
suggestions
of
the
way
in
which
the
various
organs
develop
division
of
labour
continues
among
the
colony
of
cells
which
make
up
the
body
and
we
get
distinct
and
digestive
cells
the
are
most
useful
at
the
head
of
an
organism
which
moves
through
the
water
just
as
the
peers
from
the
head
of
the
ship
and
there
they
develop
most
thickly
by
a
fresh
division
of
labour
some
of
these
cells
become
especially
sensitive
to
light
some
to
the
chemical
qualities
of
matter
some
to
movements
of
the
water
we
have
the
beginning
of
the
eyes
the
nose
and
the
ears
as
simple
little
depressions
in
the
skin
of
the
head
lined
with
these
sensitive
cells
a
muscular
gullet
arises
to
protect
the
digestive
tube
a
simple
drainage
channel
for
waste
matter
forms
under
the
skin
other
channels
permit
the
passage
of
the
fluid
food
become
in
the
higher
worms
muscular
and
begin
to
contract
somewhat
erratically
at
first
and
drive
the
blood
through
the
system
here
perhaps
are
millions
of
years
of
development
compressed
into
a
paragraph
but
the
purpose
of
this
work
is
chiefly
to
describe
the
material
record
of
the
advance
of
life
in
the
earth
strata
and
show
how
it
is
related
to
great
geological
changes
we
must
therefore
abstain
from
endeavouring
to
trace
the
genealogy
of
the
innumerable
types
of
animals
which
were
until
recently
collected
in
zoology
under
the
heading
worms
it
is
more
pertinent
to
inquire
how
the
higher
classes
of
animals
which
we
found
in
the
cambrian
seas
can
have
arisen
from
this
primitive
population
the
struggle
for
life
in
the
archaean
ocean
would
become
keener
and
more
exacting
with
the
appearance
of
each
new
and
more
effective
type
that
is
a
familiar
principle
in
our
industrial
world
and
we
shall
find
it
illustrated
throughout
our
story
we
therefore
find
the
various
processes
of
evolution
which
we
have
already
seen
now
actively
at
work
among
the
swarming
archaean
population
and
producing
several
very
distinct
types
in
some
of
these
struggling
organisms
speed
is
developed
together
with
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
and
a
line
slowly
ascends
toward
the
fish
which
we
will
consider
later
in
others
defensive
armour
is
chiefly
developed
and
we
get
the
lines
of
the
heavy
sluggish
the
molluscs
and
brachiopods
and
by
a
later
compromise
between
speed
and
armour
the
more
active
arthropods
in
others
the
reappears
the
creature
retires
from
the
life
attaches
itself
to
a
fixed
base
and
becomes
the
bryozoan
or
the
echinoderm
to
trace
the
development
of
these
types
in
any
detail
is
impossible
the
early
remains
are
not
preserved
but
some
clues
are
found
in
nature
or
in
embryonic
development
and
when
the
types
do
begin
to
be
preserved
in
the
rocks
we
find
the
process
of
evolution
plainly
at
work
in
them
we
will
therefore
say
a
few
words
about
the
general
evolution
of
each
type
and
then
return
to
the
geological
record
in
the
cambrian
rocks
the
starfish
the
most
familiar
representative
of
the
echinoderms
seems
very
far
removed
from
the
kind
of
ancestor
we
have
been
imagining
but
fortunately
the
very
interesting
story
of
the
starfish
is
easily
learned
from
the
geological
chronicle
reflect
on
the
expansion
of
its
arms
and
then
imagine
it
mounted
on
a
stalk
mouth
side
upward
with
those
arms
more
tapering
than
they
now
are
waving
round
the
mouth
that
apparently
was
the
past
of
the
starfish
and
its
cousins
we
shall
see
that
the
earliest
echinoderms
we
know
are
structures
on
stalks
with
a
stiff
limy
frame
and
as
in
all
sessile
animals
a
number
of
waving
arms
round
the
mouth
in
the
next
geological
age
the
stalk
will
become
a
long
and
flexible
arrangement
of
muscles
and
plates
of
chalk
the
cup
will
be
more
perfectly
compacted
of
chalky
plates
and
the
five
arms
will
taper
and
branch
until
they
have
an
almost
feathery
appearance
and
the
animal
will
be
considered
a
by
the
early
geologist
the
evidence
suggests
that
both
the
and
the
stalked
echinoderms
descend
from
a
common
stalked
archaean
ancestor
some
primitive
animal
abandoned
the
habit
and
attached
itself
like
a
polyp
to
the
floor
like
all
such
sessile
animals
it
developed
a
wreath
of
arms
round
the
open
mouth
the
holothurian
seems
to
be
a
type
that
left
the
stalk
retaining
the
little
wreath
of
arms
before
the
body
was
heavily
protected
and
deformed
in
the
others
a
strong
limy
skeleton
was
developed
and
the
nerves
and
other
organs
were
modified
in
adaptation
to
the
or
structure
another
branch
of
the
family
then
abandoned
the
stalk
and
spreading
its
arms
flat
and
gradually
developing
in
them
numbers
of
little
feet
became
the
starfish
in
the
living
comatula
we
find
a
star
passing
through
the
stalked
stage
in
its
early
development
when
it
looks
like
a
tiny
the
has
evolved
from
the
star
by
folding
the
arms
into
a
ball
see
the
section
on
echinoderms
by
professor
macbride
in
the
cambridge
natural
history
i
the
bryozoa
etc
are
another
and
lower
branch
of
the
primitive
active
organisms
which
have
adopted
a
sessile
life
in
the
on
the
other
hand
the
principle
of
has
its
greatest
development
it
is
assuredly
a
long
and
obscure
way
that
leads
from
the
ancestral
type
of
animal
we
have
been
describing
to
the
headless
and
shapeless
mussel
or
oyster
such
a
degeneration
is
however
precisely
what
we
should
expect
to
find
in
the
circumstances
indeed
the
larva
of
many
of
the
headless
molluscs
have
a
mouth
and
eyes
and
there
is
a
very
common
type
of
larva
the
trochosphere
in
the
mollusc
world
which
approaches
the
earlier
form
of
some
of
the
higher
worms
the
molluscs
as
we
shall
see
provide
some
admirable
illustrations
of
the
process
of
evolution
in
some
of
the
later
fossilised
specimens
planorbis
paludina
etc
we
can
trace
the
animal
as
it
gradually
passes
from
one
species
to
another
the
freshening
of
the
caspian
sea
which
was
an
outlying
part
of
the
mediterranean
quite
late
in
the
geological
record
seems
to
have
evolved
several
new
genera
of
molluscs
although
therefore
the
remains
are
not
preserved
of
those
primitive
molluscs
in
which
we
might
see
the
protecting
shell
gradually
thickening
and
deforming
the
body
we
are
not
without
indications
of
the
process
two
unequal
branches
of
the
early
wormlike
organisms
shrank
into
strong
protective
shells
the
lower
branch
became
the
brachiopods
the
more
advanced
branch
the
molluscs
in
the
mollusc
world
in
turn
there
are
several
early
types
developed
in
the
pelecypods
or
lamellibranchs
the
mussel
oyster
etc
the
animal
retires
wholly
within
its
fortress
and
degenerates
the
gastropods
snails
etc
compromise
and
retain
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
so
that
they
degenerate
less
the
highest
group
the
cephalopods
keep
their
heads
in
the
literal
sense
and
we
shall
find
them
advancing
from
form
to
form
until
in
the
octopus
of
a
later
age
they
discard
the
ancestral
shell
and
become
the
aristocrats
of
the
mollusc
kingdom
the
last
and
most
important
line
that
led
upward
from
the
chaos
of
archaean
worms
is
that
of
the
arthropods
its
early
characteristic
was
the
acquisition
of
a
chitinous
coat
over
the
body
embryonic
indications
show
that
this
was
at
first
a
continuous
shield
but
a
type
arose
in
which
the
coat
broke
into
sections
covering
each
segment
of
the
body
giving
greater
freedom
of
movement
the
shield
in
fact
became
a
fine
coat
of
mail
the
trilobite
is
an
early
and
imperfect
experiment
of
the
class
and
the
larva
of
the
modern
bears
witness
that
it
has
not
perished
without
leaving
descendants
how
later
crustacea
increase
the
toughness
of
the
coat
by
deposits
of
lime
and
lead
on
to
the
crab
and
lobster
and
how
one
early
branch
invades
the
land
develops
apparatus
and
culminates
in
the
spiders
and
insects
will
be
considered
later
we
shall
see
that
there
is
most
remarkable
evidence
connecting
the
highest
of
the
arthropods
the
insect
with
a
remote
annelid
ancestor
we
are
thus
not
entirely
without
clues
to
the
origin
of
the
more
advanced
animals
we
find
when
the
fuller
geological
record
begins
further
embryological
study
and
possibly
the
discovery
of
surviving
primitive
forms
of
which
central
africa
may
yet
yield
a
number
may
enlarge
our
knowledge
but
it
is
likely
to
remain
very
imperfect
the
fossil
records
of
the
long
ages
during
which
the
mollusc
the
crustacean
and
the
echinoderm
slowly
assumed
their
characteristic
forms
are
hopelessly
lost
but
we
are
now
prepared
to
return
to
the
record
which
survives
and
we
shall
find
the
remaining
story
of
the
earth
a
very
ample
and
interesting
chronicle
of
evolution
chapter
vii
the
passage
to
the
land
slender
as
our
knowledge
is
of
the
earlier
evolution
of
the
invertebrate
animals
we
return
to
our
cambrian
population
with
greater
interest
the
uncouth
trilobite
and
its
livelier
cousins
the
sluggish
skulking
brachiopod
and
mollusc
the
squirming
annelids
and
the
cystids
corals
and
sponges
are
the
outcome
of
millions
of
years
of
struggle
just
as
men
when
their
culture
and
their
warfare
advanced
clothed
themselves
with
armour
and
the
most
completely
mailed
survived
the
battle
so
generation
after
generation
the
thicker
and
animals
survived
in
the
archaean
battlefield
and
the
cambrian
age
opened
upon
the
various
fashions
of
armour
that
we
there
described
but
although
half
the
story
of
life
is
over
organisation
is
still
imperfect
and
sluggish
we
have
now
to
see
how
it
advances
to
higher
levels
and
how
the
drama
is
transferred
from
the
ocean
to
a
new
and
more
stimulating
environment
the
cambrian
age
begins
with
a
vigorous
move
on
the
part
of
the
land
the
seas
roll
back
from
the
shores
of
the
lost
atlantis
and
vast
regions
are
laid
bare
to
the
sun
and
the
rains
in
the
bays
and
hollows
of
the
distant
shores
the
animal
survivors
of
the
great
upheaval
adapt
themselves
to
their
fresh
homes
and
continue
the
struggle
but
the
rivers
and
the
waves
are
at
work
once
more
upon
the
land
and
as
the
cambrian
age
proceeds
the
fringes
of
the
continents
are
sheared
and
the
steadily
advances
upon
the
land
by
the
end
of
the
cambrian
age
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
land
is
covered
with
a
shallow
sea
in
which
the
debris
of
its
surface
is
deposited
the
levelling
continues
through
the
next
ordovician
period
before
its
close
nearly
the
whole
of
the
united
states
and
the
greater
part
of
canada
are
under
water
and
the
new
land
that
had
appeared
on
the
site
of
europe
is
also
for
the
most
part
submerged
the
present
british
isles
are
almost
reduced
to
a
strip
of
ireland
the
northern
extremity
of
scotland
and
large
islands
in
the
and
centre
of
england
we
have
already
seen
that
these
victories
of
the
sea
are
just
as
stimulating
in
a
different
way
to
animals
as
the
victories
of
the
land
american
geologists
are
tracing
in
a
very
instructive
way
the
effect
on
that
early
population
of
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
in
each
arm
of
the
sea
is
a
distinctive
fauna
life
is
still
very
parochial
the
great
cosmopolitans
the
fishes
have
not
yet
arrived
as
the
land
is
revelled
the
arms
of
the
sea
approach
each
other
and
at
last
mingle
their
waters
and
their
populations
with
stimulating
effect
provincial
characters
are
modified
and
cosmopolitan
characters
increase
in
the
great
central
sea
of
america
the
vast
shallow
waters
provide
a
greatly
enlarged
theatre
for
the
life
of
the
time
and
it
flourishes
enormously
then
at
the
end
of
the
ordovician
the
land
begins
to
rise
once
more
whether
it
was
due
to
a
fresh
shrinking
of
the
crust
or
to
the
simple
process
we
have
described
or
both
we
need
not
attempt
to
determine
but
both
in
europe
and
america
there
is
a
great
emergence
of
land
the
and
the
shallow
water
are
narrowed
the
struggle
is
intensified
in
them
and
we
pass
into
the
silurian
age
with
a
greatly
reduced
number
but
more
advanced
variety
of
animals
in
the
silurian
age
the
sea
advances
once
more
and
the
expand
there
is
another
great
expansive
evolution
of
life
but
the
silurian
age
closes
with
a
fresh
and
very
extensive
emergence
of
the
land
and
this
time
it
will
have
the
most
important
consequences
for
two
new
things
have
meantime
appeared
on
the
earth
the
fish
has
evolved
in
the
waters
and
the
plant
at
least
has
found
a
footing
on
the
land
these
geological
changes
which
we
have
summarised
and
which
have
been
too
little
noticed
until
recently
in
evolutionary
studies
occupied
years
on
the
lowest
estimate
and
probably
twice
that
period
the
impatient
critic
of
evolutionary
hypotheses
is
apt
to
forget
the
length
of
these
early
periods
we
shall
see
that
in
the
last
two
or
three
million
years
of
the
earth
story
most
extraordinary
progress
has
been
made
in
plant
and
animal
development
and
can
be
very
fairly
traced
how
much
advance
should
we
allow
for
these
seven
or
fourteen
million
years
of
swarming
life
and
changing
environments
we
can
not
nearly
cover
the
whole
ground
of
paleontology
for
the
period
and
must
be
content
to
notice
some
of
the
more
interesting
advances
and
then
deal
more
fully
with
the
evolution
of
the
fish
the
forerunner
of
the
great
land
animals
the
trilobite
was
the
most
arresting
figure
in
the
cambrian
sea
and
its
fortunes
deserve
a
paragraph
it
reaches
its
climax
in
the
ordovician
sea
and
then
begins
to
decline
as
more
powerful
animals
come
upon
the
scene
at
first
apparently
an
eyeless
organism
it
gradually
develops
compound
eyes
and
in
some
species
the
experts
have
calculated
that
there
were
facets
to
each
eye
as
time
goes
on
also
the
eye
stands
out
from
the
head
on
a
kind
of
stalk
giving
a
wider
range
of
vision
some
of
the
more
sluggish
species
seem
to
have
been
able
to
roll
themselves
up
like
hedgehogs
in
their
shells
when
an
enemy
approached
but
another
branch
of
the
same
group
crustacea
has
meantime
advanced
and
it
gradually
supersedes
the
dwindling
trilobites
toward
the
close
of
the
silurian
great
crustaceans
pterygotus
eurypterus
etc
make
their
appearance
their
development
is
obscure
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
rocks
only
give
the
record
of
and
only
a
part
of
that
is
as
yet
opened
by
geology
some
experts
think
that
they
were
developed
in
inland
waters
reaching
sometimes
a
length
of
five
or
six
feet
with
two
large
compound
eyes
and
some
smaller
ocelli
they
must
have
been
the
giants
of
the
silurian
ocean
until
the
great
sharks
and
other
fishes
appeared
the
quaint
stalked
echinoderm
which
also
we
noticed
in
the
cambrian
shallows
has
now
evolved
into
a
more
handsome
creature
the
the
body
is
now
composed
of
a
large
number
of
limy
plates
clothed
with
flesh
the
arms
are
long
tapering
symmetrical
and
richly
fringed
the
stalk
advances
higher
and
higher
until
the
animal
sometimes
waves
its
feathery
arms
from
the
top
of
a
flexible
pedestal
composed
of
millions
of
tiny
chalk
disks
small
forests
of
these
adorn
the
floor
of
the
silurian
ocean
and
their
broken
and
dead
frames
form
whole
beds
of
limestone
the
primitive
cystids
dwindle
and
die
out
in
the
presence
of
such
powerful
competitors
of
species
only
a
dozen
linger
in
the
silurian
strata
though
a
new
and
more
advanced
type
the
blastoid
holds
the
field
for
a
time
it
is
the
age
of
the
crinoids
or
the
starfish
which
has
abandoned
the
stalk
does
not
seem
to
prosper
as
yet
and
the
appears
their
age
will
come
later
no
or
which
would
hardly
be
preserved
are
found
as
yet
it
is
precisely
the
order
of
appearance
which
our
theory
of
their
evolution
demands
the
brachiopods
have
passed
into
entirely
new
and
more
advanced
species
in
the
many
advances
and
retreats
of
the
shores
but
the
molluscs
show
more
interesting
progress
the
commanding
group
from
the
start
is
that
of
the
molluscs
which
have
kept
their
head
the
cephalopods
and
their
large
shells
show
a
most
instructive
evolution
the
first
great
representative
of
the
tribe
is
a
cephalopod
which
becomes
the
tyrant
and
scavenger
of
the
silurian
ocean
chamberlin
its
tapering
conical
shell
sometimes
runs
to
a
length
of
fifteen
feet
and
a
diameter
of
one
foot
it
would
of
itself
be
an
important
evolutionary
factor
in
the
primitive
seas
and
might
explain
more
than
one
advance
in
protective
armour
or
retreat
into
heavy
shells
as
the
period
advances
the
shell
begins
to
curve
and
at
last
it
forms
a
close
spiral
coil
this
would
be
so
great
an
advantage
that
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
the
coiled
type
goniatites
gain
upon
and
gradually
replace
the
types
orthoceratites
the
silurian
ocean
swarms
with
these
great
shelled
cephalopods
of
which
the
little
nautilus
is
now
the
only
survivor
we
will
not
enlarge
on
the
sponges
and
corals
which
are
slowly
advancing
toward
the
higher
modern
types
two
new
and
very
powerful
organisms
have
appeared
and
merit
the
closest
attention
one
is
the
fish
the
remote
ancestor
of
the
birds
and
mammals
that
will
one
day
rule
the
earth
the
other
may
be
the
ancestor
of
the
fish
itself
or
it
may
be
one
of
the
many
abortive
outcomes
and
unsuccessful
experiments
of
the
stirring
life
of
the
time
and
while
these
new
types
are
themselves
a
result
of
the
great
and
stimulating
changes
which
we
have
reviewed
and
the
incessant
struggle
for
food
and
safety
they
in
turn
enormously
quicken
the
pace
of
development
the
dreadnought
appears
in
the
primitive
seas
the
effect
on
the
fleets
of
the
world
of
the
evolution
of
our
latest
type
of
battleship
gives
us
a
faint
idea
of
the
effect
on
all
the
moving
population
of
the
coming
of
these
monsters
of
the
deep
the
age
had
not
lacked
incentives
to
progress
it
now
obtains
a
more
terrible
and
stimulus
to
understand
the
situation
let
us
see
how
the
battle
of
land
and
sea
had
proceeded
the
devonian
period
had
opened
with
a
fresh
emergence
of
the
land
especially
in
europe
and
great
inland
seas
or
lakes
were
left
in
the
hollows
the
tincture
of
iron
which
gives
a
red
colour
to
our
characteristic
devonian
rocks
the
old
red
sandstone
shows
us
that
the
sand
was
deposited
in
inland
waters
the
fish
had
already
been
developed
and
the
devonian
rocks
show
it
swarming
in
great
numbers
and
variety
in
the
enclosed
seas
and
round
the
fringe
of
the
continents
the
first
generation
was
a
group
of
strange
creatures
half
fish
and
half
crustacean
which
are
known
as
the
ostracoderms
they
had
large
heads
which
recall
the
trilobite
and
suggest
that
they
too
burrowed
in
the
mud
of
the
sea
or
as
many
think
of
the
inland
lakes
making
havoc
among
the
worms
and
small
crustacea
the
of
their
bodies
was
remarkably
in
structure
but
they
had
no
backbone
though
we
can
not
say
whether
they
may
not
have
had
a
rod
of
cartilage
along
the
back
and
no
articulated
jaws
like
the
fish
some
regard
them
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
crustacea
and
the
fishes
but
the
general
feeling
is
that
they
were
an
abortive
development
in
the
direction
of
the
fish
the
sharks
and
other
large
fishes
which
have
appeared
in
the
silurian
easily
displace
these
clumsy
and
competitors
one
almost
thinks
of
the
aeroplane
superseding
the
navigable
balloon
of
the
fishes
the
arthrodirans
dominated
the
inland
seas
apparently
while
the
sharks
commanded
the
ocean
one
of
the
arthrodirans
the
dinichthys
terrible
fish
is
the
most
formidable
fish
known
to
science
it
measured
twenty
feet
from
snout
to
tail
its
monstrous
head
three
feet
in
width
was
heavily
armoured
and
instead
of
teeth
its
great
jaws
two
feet
in
length
were
sharpened
and
closed
over
the
victim
like
a
gigantic
pair
of
clippers
the
strongly
plated
heads
of
these
fishes
were
commonly
a
foot
or
two
feet
in
width
life
in
the
waters
became
more
exacting
than
ever
but
the
arthrodirans
were
unwieldy
and
sluggish
and
had
to
give
way
before
more
progressive
types
the
toothed
shark
gradually
became
the
lord
of
the
waters
the
early
shark
ate
amongst
other
things
quantities
of
molluscs
and
brachiopods
possibly
he
began
with
crustacea
in
any
case
the
practice
of
crunching
shellfish
led
to
a
stronger
and
stronger
development
of
the
hard
plate
which
lined
his
mouth
the
prickles
of
the
plate
grew
larger
and
harder
until
as
may
be
seen
in
the
mouth
of
a
young
shark
the
cavity
was
lined
with
teeth
in
the
bulk
of
the
devonian
sharks
these
developed
into
what
are
significantly
called
pavement
teeth
they
were
solid
plates
of
enamel
an
inch
or
an
inch
and
a
half
in
width
with
which
the
monster
ground
its
enormous
meals
of
molluscs
crustacea
etc
a
new
and
stimulating
element
had
come
into
the
life
of
the
invertebrate
world
other
sharks
snapped
larger
victims
and
developed
the
teeth
on
the
edges
of
their
jaws
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
others
until
we
find
these
teeth
in
the
course
of
time
solid
triangular
masses
of
enamel
four
or
five
inches
long
with
edges
imagine
these
terrible
mouths
the
shears
of
the
arthrodiran
and
the
grindstones
and
terrible
crescents
of
the
giant
sharks
moving
speedily
amongst
the
crowded
inhabitants
of
the
waters
and
it
is
easy
to
see
what
a
stimulus
to
the
attainment
of
speed
and
of
protective
devices
was
given
to
the
whole
world
of
the
time
what
was
the
origin
of
the
fish
here
we
are
in
much
the
same
position
as
we
were
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
the
higher
invertebrates
once
the
fish
plainly
appears
upon
the
scene
it
is
found
to
be
undergoing
a
process
of
evolution
like
all
other
animals
the
vast
majority
of
our
fishes
have
bony
frames
or
are
teleosts
the
fishes
of
the
devonian
age
nearly
all
have
frames
of
cartilage
and
we
know
from
embryonic
development
that
cartilage
is
the
first
stage
in
the
formation
of
bone
in
the
teeth
and
tails
also
we
find
a
gradual
evolution
toward
the
higher
types
but
the
earlier
record
is
for
reasons
i
have
already
given
obscure
and
as
my
purpose
is
rather
to
discover
the
agencies
of
evolution
than
to
strain
slender
evidence
in
drawing
up
pedigrees
i
need
only
make
brief
reference
to
the
state
of
the
problem
until
comparatively
recent
times
the
animal
world
fell
into
two
clearly
distinct
halves
the
vertebrates
and
the
invertebrates
there
were
several
anatomical
differences
between
the
two
provinces
but
the
most
conspicuous
and
most
puzzling
was
the
backbone
nowhere
in
living
nature
or
in
the
rocks
was
any
intermediate
type
known
between
the
backboned
and
the
animal
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
however
several
animals
of
an
intermediate
type
were
found
the
has
in
its
early
youth
the
line
of
cartilage
through
the
body
which
in
embryonic
development
represents
the
first
stage
of
the
backbone
the
lancelet
and
the
appendicularia
have
a
rod
of
cartilage
throughout
life
the
worm
shows
traces
of
it
these
are
regarded
as
surviving
specimens
of
various
groups
of
animals
which
in
early
times
fell
between
the
invertebrate
and
vertebrate
worlds
and
illustrate
the
transition
with
their
aid
a
genealogical
tree
was
constructed
for
the
fish
it
was
assumed
that
some
cambrian
or
silurian
annelid
obtained
this
stiffening
rod
of
cartilage
the
next
advantage
we
have
seen
it
in
many
cases
was
to
combine
flexibility
with
support
the
rod
was
divided
into
connected
sections
vertebrae
and
hardened
into
bone
besides
stiffening
the
body
it
provided
a
valuable
shelter
for
the
spinal
cord
and
its
upper
part
expanded
into
a
box
to
enclose
the
brain
the
fins
were
formed
of
folds
of
skin
which
were
thrown
off
at
the
sides
and
on
the
back
as
the
animal
wriggled
through
the
water
they
were
of
use
in
swimming
and
sections
of
them
were
stiffened
with
rods
of
cartilage
and
became
the
pairs
of
fins
gill
slits
as
in
some
of
the
highest
worms
appeared
in
the
throat
the
mouth
was
improved
by
the
formation
of
jaws
and
the
worm
culminated
in
the
shark
some
experts
think
however
that
the
fish
developed
directly
from
a
crustacean
and
hold
that
the
ostracoderms
are
the
connecting
link
a
close
discussion
of
the
anatomical
details
would
be
out
of
place
here
and
the
question
remains
open
for
the
present
directly
or
indirectly
the
fish
is
a
descendant
of
some
archaean
annelid
it
is
most
probable
that
the
shark
was
the
first
true
there
are
unrecognisable
fragments
of
fishes
in
the
ordovician
and
silurian
rocks
but
the
first
complete
skeletons
lanarkia
etc
are
of
small
like
creatures
and
the
low
organisation
of
the
group
to
which
the
shark
belongs
the
elasmobranchs
makes
it
probable
that
they
are
the
most
primitive
other
remains
palaeospondylus
show
that
the
lampreys
had
already
developed
see
especially
gaskell
origin
of
vertebrates
two
groups
were
developed
from
the
primitive
fish
which
have
great
interest
for
us
our
next
step
in
fact
is
to
trace
the
passage
of
the
fish
from
the
water
to
the
land
one
of
the
most
momentous
chapters
in
the
story
of
life
to
that
incident
or
accident
of
primitive
life
we
owe
our
own
existence
and
the
whole
development
of
the
higher
types
of
animals
the
advance
of
natural
history
in
modern
times
has
made
this
passage
to
the
land
easy
to
understand
not
only
does
every
frog
reenact
it
in
the
course
of
its
development
but
we
know
many
fishes
that
can
live
out
of
water
there
is
an
indian
perch
called
the
climbing
perch
but
it
has
only
once
been
seen
by
a
european
to
climb
a
tree
which
crosses
the
fields
in
search
of
another
pool
when
its
own
pool
is
evaporating
an
indian
marine
fish
periophthalmus
remains
hunting
on
the
shore
when
the
tide
goes
out
more
important
still
several
fishes
have
lungs
as
well
as
gills
the
ceratodus
of
certain
queensland
rivers
has
one
lung
though
i
was
told
by
the
experts
in
queensland
it
is
not
a
and
never
lives
in
dry
mud
however
the
protopterus
of
africa
and
the
lepidosiren
of
south
america
have
two
lungs
as
well
as
gills
and
can
live
either
in
water
or
in
the
dry
season
on
land
when
the
skeletons
of
fishes
of
the
ceratodus
type
were
discovered
in
the
devonian
rocks
it
was
felt
that
we
had
found
the
of
the
land
vertebrates
but
a
closer
anatomical
examination
has
made
this
doubtful
the
devonian
has
characters
which
do
not
seem
to
lead
on
to
the
amphibia
the
same
general
cause
probably
led
many
groups
to
leave
the
water
or
adapt
themselves
to
living
on
land
as
well
as
in
water
and
the
abundant
dipoi
or
dipneusts
of
the
devonian
lakes
are
one
of
the
chief
of
these
groups
which
have
luckily
left
descendants
to
our
time
the
ancestors
of
the
amphibia
are
generally
sought
amongst
the
crossopterygii
a
very
large
group
of
fishes
in
devonian
times
with
very
few
representatives
it
is
more
profitable
to
investigate
the
process
itself
than
to
make
a
precarious
search
for
the
actual
fish
and
fortunately
this
inquiry
is
more
hopeful
the
remains
that
we
find
make
it
probable
that
the
fish
left
the
water
about
the
beginning
of
the
devonian
or
the
end
of
the
silurian
now
this
period
coincides
with
two
circumstances
which
throw
a
complete
light
on
the
step
one
is
the
great
rise
of
the
land
catching
myriads
of
fishes
in
enclosed
inland
seas
and
the
other
is
the
appearance
of
formidable
carnivores
in
the
waters
as
the
seas
evaporated
and
the
great
carnage
proceeded
the
land
which
was
already
covered
with
plants
and
inhabited
by
insects
offered
a
safe
retreat
for
such
as
could
adopt
it
emigration
to
the
land
had
been
going
on
for
ages
as
we
shall
see
curious
as
it
must
seem
to
the
inexpert
the
fishes
or
some
of
them
were
better
prepared
than
most
other
animals
to
leave
the
water
the
chief
requirement
was
a
lung
or
interior
bag
by
which
the
air
could
be
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
absorbing
blood
vessels
such
a
bag
broadly
speaking
most
of
the
fishes
possess
in
their
a
bag
of
gas
by
compressing
or
expanding
which
they
alter
their
specific
gravity
in
the
water
in
some
fishes
it
is
double
in
some
it
is
supplied
with
in
some
it
is
connected
by
a
tube
with
the
gullet
and
therefore
with
the
atmosphere
it
is
now
usually
thought
that
the
inland
seas
were
the
theatre
of
the
passage
to
land
i
must
point
out
however
that
the
wide
distribution
of
our
dipneusts
in
australia
tropical
africa
and
south
america
suggests
that
they
were
marine
though
they
now
live
in
fresh
water
but
we
shall
see
that
a
continent
united
the
three
regions
at
one
time
and
it
may
afford
some
explanation
thus
we
get
very
clear
suggestions
of
the
transition
from
water
to
land
we
must
of
course
conceive
it
as
a
slow
and
gradual
adaptation
at
first
there
may
have
been
a
rough
contrivance
for
deriving
oxygen
directly
and
partially
from
the
atmosphere
as
the
water
of
the
lake
became
impure
so
important
an
advantage
would
be
fostered
and
as
the
inland
sea
became
smaller
or
its
population
larger
or
fiercer
the
fishes
with
a
sufficiently
developed
apparatus
passed
to
the
land
where
as
yet
they
would
find
no
serious
enemy
the
fact
is
beyond
dispute
the
theory
of
how
it
occurred
is
plausible
enough
the
consequences
were
momentous
great
changes
were
preparing
on
the
land
and
in
a
comparatively
short
time
we
shall
find
its
new
inhabitant
subjected
to
a
fierce
test
of
circumstances
that
will
carry
it
to
an
enormously
higher
level
than
life
had
yet
reached
i
have
said
that
the
fact
of
this
transition
to
the
land
is
beyond
dispute
the
evidence
is
very
varied
but
need
not
all
be
enlarged
upon
here
the
widespread
dipneust
fishes
of
the
devonian
rocks
bear
strong
witness
to
it
and
the
appearance
of
the
amphibian
immediately
afterwards
makes
it
certain
the
development
of
the
frog
is
a
reminiscence
of
it
on
the
lines
of
the
embryonic
law
which
we
saw
earlier
an
animal
in
its
individual
development
more
or
less
reproduces
the
past
phases
of
its
ancestry
so
the
begins
life
as
a
fixed
polyp
a
kind
of
comatula
opens
its
career
as
a
stalked
the
gorgeous
is
at
first
an
uncouth
aquatic
animal
and
the
ethereal
butterfly
a
creature
but
the
most
singular
and
instructive
of
all
these
embryonic
reminiscences
of
the
past
is
found
in
the
fact
that
all
the
higher
of
clearly
reproduce
a
in
their
embryonic
development
in
the
third
and
fourth
weeks
of
development
the
human
embryo
shows
four
closed
slits
under
the
head
with
corresponding
arches
the
bird
the
dog
the
horse
all
the
higher
land
animals
in
a
word
pass
through
the
same
phase
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
these
structures
do
not
recall
the
and
of
the
fish
but
are
folds
due
to
the
packing
of
the
embryo
in
the
womb
in
point
of
fact
they
appear
just
at
the
time
when
the
human
embryo
is
only
a
fifth
of
an
inch
long
and
there
is
no
such
compression
but
all
doubt
as
to
their
interpretation
is
dispelled
when
we
remove
the
skin
and
examine
the
heart
and
the
heart
is
up
in
the
throat
as
in
the
fish
and
has
only
two
chambers
as
in
the
fish
not
four
as
in
the
bird
and
mammal
and
the
arteries
rise
in
five
pairs
of
arches
over
the
swellings
in
the
throat
as
they
do
in
the
lower
fish
but
do
not
in
the
bird
and
mammal
the
arrangement
is
purely
temporary
lasting
only
a
couple
of
weeks
in
the
human
embryo
and
purposeless
half
these
arteries
will
disappear
again
they
quite
plainly
exist
to
supply
fine
for
breathing
at
the
and
are
never
used
for
the
embryo
does
not
breathe
except
through
the
mother
they
are
a
most
instructive
reminder
of
the
devonian
fish
which
quitted
its
element
and
became
the
ancestor
of
all
the
birds
and
mammals
of
a
later
age
several
other

of

the

of

up
instead
of
at
the

of
the
vertebral
column
the

of
the
ears
the
nose
the
jaws
have
the
same
lesson
but
the
one
detailed
illustration
will
suffice
the
millions
of
years
of
stimulating
change
and
struggle
which
we
have
summarised
have
resulted
in
the
production
of
a
fish
which
walks
on
four
limbs
as
the
south
american
does
and
breathes
the
atmosphere
we
have
been
quite
unable
to
follow
the
vast
changes
which
have
meantime
taken
place
in
its
organisation
the
eyes
which
were
mere
pits
in
the
skin
lined
with
pigment
cells
in
the
early
worm
now
have
a
crystalline
lens
to
concentrate
the
light
and
define
objects
on
the
nerve
the
ears
which
were
at
first
similar
sensitive
pits
in
the
skin
on
which
lay
a
little
stone
whose
movements
gave
the
animal
some
sense
of
direction
are
now
closed
vesicles
in
the
skull
and
begin
to
be
sensitive
to
waves
of
sound
the
nose
which
was
at
first
two
blind
sensitive
pits
in
the
skin
of
the
head
now
consists
of
two
nostrils
opening
into
the
mouth
with
an
olfactory
nerve
spreading
richly
over
the
passages
the
brain
which
was
a
mere
clump
of
connecting
the
rough
is
now
a
large
and
intricate
structure
and
already
exhibits
a
little
of
that
important
region
the
cerebrum
in
which
the
varied
images
of
the
outside
world
are
combined
the
heart
which
was
formerly
was
a
mere
swelling
of
a
part
of
one
of
the
now
has
two
chambers
we
can
not
pursue
these
detailed
improvements
of
the
mechanism
as
we
might
through
the
ascending
types
of
animals
enough
if
we
see
more
or
less
clearly
how
the
changes
in
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
rise
of
its
successive
dynasties
of
carnivores
have
stimulated
living
things
to
higher
and
higher
levels
in
the
primitive
ocean
we
pass
to
the
clearer
and
far
more
important
story
of
life
on
land
pursuing
the
fish
through
its
continuous
adaptations
to
new
conditions
until

it
progresses
it
reaches
the
height
of

and
mammal
life
chapter
viii
the
with
the
beginning
of
life
on
land
we
open
a
new
and
more
important
volume
of
the
story
of
life
and
we
may
take
the
opportunity
to
make
clearer
certain
principles
or
processes
of
development
which
we
may
seem
hitherto
to
have
taken
for
granted
the
evolutionary
work
is
too
often
a
mere
superficial
description
of
the
strange
and
advancing
classes
of
plants
and
animals
which
cross
the
stage
of
geology
why
they
change
and
advance
is
not
explained
i
have
endeavoured
to
supply
this
explanation
by
putting
the
successive
populations
of
the
earth
in
their
respective
environments
and
showing
the
continuous
and
stimulating
effect
on
them
of
changes
in
those
environments
we
have
thus
learned
to
decipher
some
lines
of
the
decalogue
of
living
nature
thou
shalt
have
a
thick
armour
thou
shalt
be
speedy
thou
shalt
shelter
from
the
more
powerful
are
some
of
the
laws
of
primeval
life
the
appearance
of
each
higher
and
more
destructive
type
enforces
them
with
more
severity
and
in
their
observance
animals
branch
outward
and
upward
into
myriads
of
temporary
or
permanent
forms
but
there
is
no
consciousness
of
law
and
no
idea
of
evading
danger
there
is
not
even
some
mysterious
instinct
telling
the
animal
as
it
used
to
be
said
to
do
certain
things
it
is
in
fact
not
strictly
accurate
to
say
that
a
certain
change
in
the
environment
stimulates
animals
to
advance
generally
speaking
it
does
not
act
on
the
advancing
at
all
but
on
the
which
it
exterminates
the
procedure
is
simple
tangible
and
unconscious
two
invading
arms
of
the
sea
meet
and
pour
together
their
different
waters
and
populations
the
habits
the
foods
and
the
enemies
of
many
types
of
animals
are
changed
the
less
fit
for
the
new
environment
die
first
the
more
fit
survive
longest
and
breed
most
of
the
new
generation
it
is
so
with
men
when
they
migrate
to
a
more
exacting
environment
whether
a
dangerous
trade
or
a
foreign
clime
again
take
the
case
of
the
introduction
of
a
giant
cephalopod
or
fish
amongst
a
population
of
molluscs
and
crustacea
the
toughest
the
speediest
the
most
alert
the
most
retiring
or
the
least
conspicuous
will
be
the
most
apt
to
survive
and
breed
in
hundreds
or
thousands
of
generations
there
will
be
an
enormous
improvement
in
the
armour
the
speed
the
sensitiveness
the
hiding
practices
and
the
protective
colours
of
the
animals
which
are
devoured
the
natural
selection
of
the
fittest
really
means
the
natural
destruction
of
the
less
fit
the
only
point
assumed
in
this
is
that
the
young
of
an
animal
or
plant
tend
to
differ
from
each
other
and
from
their
parents
darwin
was
content
to
take
this
as
a
fact
of
common
observation
as
it
obviously
is
but
later
science
has
thrown
some
light
on
the
causes
of
these
variations
in
the
first
place
the
germs
in
the
parent
body
may
themselves
be
subject
to
struggle
and
natural
selection
and
not
share
equally
in
the
then
in
the
case
of
the
higher
animals
or
the
majority
of
animals
there
is
a
clear
source
of
variation
in
the
fact
that
the
mature
germ
is
formed
of
certain
elements
from
two
different
parents
four
grandparents
and
so
on
in
the
case
of
the
lower
animals
the
germs
and
larvae
float
independently
in
the
water
and
are
exposed
to
many
influences
modern
embryologists
have
found
by
experiment
that
an
alteration
of
the
temperature
or
the
chemical
considerable
effect
on
eggs
and
larvae
some
recent
experiments
have
shown
that
such
changes
may
even
affect
the
eggs
in
the
ovary
these
discoveries
are
very
important
and
suggestive
because
the
geological
changes
which
we
are
studying
are
especially
apt
to
bring
about
changes
of
temperature
and
changes
in
the
freshness
or
saltiness
of
water
evolution
is
therefore
not
a
mere
description
of
the
procession
of
living
things
it
is
to
a
great
extent
an
explanation
of
the
procession
when
however
we
come
to
apply
these
general
principles
to
certain
aspects
of
the
advance
in
organisation
we
find
fundamental
differences
of
opinion
among
biologists
which
must
be
noted
as
sir
ray
lankester
recently
said
it
is
not
at
all
true
that
darwinism
is
questioned
in
zoology
it
is
true
only
that
darwin
was
not
omniscient
or
infallible
and
some
of
his
opinions
are
disputed
let
me
introduce
the
subject
with
a
particular
instance
of
evolution
the
this
animal
has
been
fitted
to
survive
the
terrible
struggle
in
the
seas
by
acquiring
such
a
form
that
it
can
lie
almost
unseen
upon
the
floor
of
the
ocean
the
eye
on
the
under
side
of
the
body
would
thus
be
useless
but
a
glance
at
a
sole
or
plaice
in
a
fishmonger
shop
will
show
that
this
eye
has
worked
upward
to
the
top
of
the
head
was
the
eye
shifted
by
the
effort
and
straining
of
the
fish
inherited
and
increased
slightly
in
each
generation
is
the
explanation
rather
that
those
fishes
in
each
generation
survived
and
bred
which
happened
from
birth
to
have
a
slight
variation
in
that
direction
though
they
did
not
inherit
the
effect
of
the
parent
effort
to
strain
the
eye
or
ought
we
to
regard
this
change
of
structure
as
brought
about
by
a
few
abrupt
and
considerable
variations
on
the
part
of
the
young
there
you
have
the
three
great
schools
which
divide
modern
evolutionists
lamarckism
weismannism
and
mendelism
or
mutationism
all
are
darwinians
no
one
doubts
that
the
was
evolved
from
an
ordinary
fish
the
is
an
ordinary
fish
in
its
youth
or
that
natural
selection
enemies
killed
off
the
old
and
transitional
types
and
overlooked
and
so
favoured
the
new
it
will
be
seen
that
the
language
used
in
this
volume
is
not
the
particular
language
of
any
one
of
these
schools
this
is
partly
because
i
wish
to
leave
seriously
controverted
questions
open
and
partly
from
a
feeling
of
compromise
which
i
may
explain
of
recent
years
another
compromise
has
been
proposed
between
the
lamarckians
and
weismannists
it
would
say
that
the
efforts
of
the
parent
and
their
effect
on
the
position
of
the
eye
in
our
case
are
not
inherited
but
might
be
of
use
in
sheltering
an
embryonic
variation
in
the
direction
of
a
displaced
eye
first
the
plain
issue
between
the
mendelians
and
the
other
two
schools
whether
the
passage
from
species
to
species
is
brought
about
by
a
series
of
small
variations
during
a
long
period
or
by
a
few
large
variations
or
mutations
in
a
short
period
is
open
to
an
obvious
compromise
it
is
quite
possible
that
both
views
are
correct
in
different
cases
and
quite
impossible
to
find
the
proportion
of
each
class
of
cases
we
shall
see
later
that
in
certain
instances
where
the
conditions
of
preservation
were
good
we
can
sometimes
trace
a
perfectly
gradual
advance
from
species
to
species
several
shellfish
have
been
traced
in
this
way
and
a
in
the
chalk
has
been
followed
quite
gradually
from
one
end
of
a
genus
to
the
other
it
is
significant
that
the
advance
of
research
is
multiplying
these
cases
there
is
no
reason
why
we
may
not
assume
most
of
the
changes
of
species
we
have
yet
seen
to
have
occurred
in
this
way
in
fact
in
some
of
the
lower
branches
of
the
animal
world
radiolaria
sponges
etc
there
is
often
no
sharp
division
of
species
at
all
but
a
gradual
series
of
living
varieties
on
the
other
hand
we
know
many
instances
of
very
considerable
sudden
changes
the
cases
quoted
by
mendelists
generally
belong
to
the
plant
world
but
instances
are
not
unknown
in
the
animal
world
a
shrimp
artemia
was
made
to
undergo
considerable
modification
by
altering
the
proportion
of
salt
in
the
water
in
which
it
was
kept
butterflies
have
been
made
to
produce
young
quite
different
from
their
normal
young
by
subjecting
them
to
abnormal
temperature
electric
currents
and
so
on
and
as
i
said
the
most
remarkable
effects
have
been
produced
on
eggs
and
embryos
by
altering
the
chemical
and
physical
conditions
rats
i
was
informed
by
the
engineer
in
charge
of
the
refrigerating
room
on
an
australian
liner
very
quickly
became
adapted
to
the
freezing
temperature
by
developing
long
hair
all
that
we
have
seen
of
the
past
changes
in
the
environment
of
animals
makes
it
probable
that
these
larger
variations
often
occur
i
would
conclude
therefore
that
evolution
has
proceeded
continuously
though
by
no
means
universally
through
the
ages
but
there
were
at
times
periods
of
more
acute
change
with
correspondingly
larger
changes
in
the
animal
and
plant
worlds
in
regard
to
the
issue
between
the
lamarckians
and
weismannists
whether
changes
acquired
by
the
parent
are
inherited
by
the
young
recent
experiments
again
suggest
something
of
a
compromise
weismann
says
that
the
body
of
the
parent
is
but
the
case
containing
the
so
that
all
modifications
of
the
living
parent
body
perish
with
it
and
do
not
affect
the
germ
which
builds
the
next
generation
certainly
when
we
reflect
that
the
ova
in
the
human
mother
ovary
seem
to
have
been
all
formed
in
the
first
year
of
her
life
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
modifications
of
her
muscles
or
nerves
can
affect
them
thus
we
can
not
hope
to
learn
anything
either
way
by
cutting
off
the
tails
of
cows
and
experiments
of
that
kind
but
it
is
acknowledged
that
certain
diseases
in
the
blood
which
nourishes
the
germs
may
affect
them
and
recent
experimenters
have
found
that
they
can
reach
and
affect
the
germs
in
the
body
by
other
agencies
and
so
produce
inherited
modifications
in
the
parent
if
this
claim
is
sustained
and
enlarged
it
may
be
concluded
that
the
greater
changes
of
environment
which
we
find
in
the
geological
chronicle
may
have
had
a
considerable
influence
of
this
kind
see
a
paper
read
by
professor
bourne
to
the
zoological
section
of
the
british
association
it
must
be
understood
that
when
i
speak
of
weismannism
i
do
not
refer
to
this
whole
theory
of
heredity
which
he
acknowledges
has
few
supporters
the
lamarckian
view
is
represented
in
britain
by
sir
turner
and
professor
darwin
in
other
countries
it
has
a
larger
proportion
of
distinguished
supporters
on
the
whole
subject
see
professor
j
thomson
heredity
dewar
and
finn
making
of
species
a
mendelian
work
and
for
essays
by
the
leaders
of
each
school
darwinism
and
modern
science
the
general
issue
however
must
remain
open
the
lamarckian
and
weismannist
theories
are
rival
interpretations
of
past
events
and
we
shall
not
find
it
necessary
to
press
either
when
the
fish
comes
to
live
on
land
for
instance
it
develops
a
bony
limb
out
of
its
fin
the
lamarckian
says
that
the
throwing
of
the
weight
of
the
body
on
the
main
stem
of
the
fin
strengthens
it
as
practice
strengthens
the
boxer
arm
and
the
effect
is
inherited
and
increased
in
each
generation
until
at
last
the
useless
paddle
of

become

weismann
says
that
the
individual
modification
by

in

is
not
inherited
but
those
young
are
favoured
which
have
at
birth

variation
in
the

of

of

as
each
of
these
interpretations
is
and
must
remain
purely
theoretical
we
will
be
content
to
tell
the
facts
in
such
cases
but
these
brief
remarks
will
enable
the
reader
to
understand
in
what
precise
sense
the
facts
we
record
are
open
to
controversy
let
us
return
to
the
chronicle
of
the
earth
we
had
reached
the
devonian
age
when
large
continents
with
great
inland
seas
existed
in
north
america
europe
and
north
asia
probably
connected
by
a
continent
across
the
north
atlantic
and
the
arctic
region
south
america
and
south
africa
were
emerging
and
a
continent
was
preparing
to
stretch
from
brazil
through
south
africa
and
the
antarctic
to
australia
and
india
the
expanse
of
land
was
with
many
oscillations
gaining
on
the
water
and
there
was
much
emigration
to
it
from
the
seas
when
the
fish
went
on
land
in
the
devonian
it
must
have
found
a
diet
insects
etc
there
and
the
insects
must
have
been
preceded
by
a
plant
population
we
have
first
therefore
to
consider
the
evolution
of
the
plant
and
see
how
it
increases
in
form
and
number
until
it
covers
the
earth
with
the
luxuriant
forests
of
the
carboniferous
period
the
plant
world
we
saw
starts
like
the
animal
world
with
a
great
kingdom
of
microscopic
representatives
and
the
same
principles
of
development
to
a
great
extent
shape
it
into
a
large
variety
of
forms
has
a
widespread
influence
among
them
the
graceful
diatom
is
a
morsel
of
plasm
enclosed
in
a
flinty
box
often
with
a
very
pretty
arrangement
of
the
pores
and
markings
the
desmid
has
a
coat
of
cellulose
and
a
less
graceful
coat
of
cellulose
encloses
the
peridinean
many
of
these
minute
plants
develop
locomotion
and
a
degree
of
sensitiveness
diatoms
peridinea
euglena
some
bacteria
adopt
animal
diet
and
rise
in
power
of
movement
and
sensitiveness
until
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
satisfactory
distinction
between
them
and
animals
then
the
social
principle
enters
first
we
have
loose
associations
of
plants
in
a
common
bed
then
closer
clusters
or
bodies
in
some
cases
volvox
the
cluster
or
the
compound
plant
is
round
and
moves
briskly
in
the
water
closely
resembling
an
animal
in
most
cases
the
cells
are
connected
in
chains
and
we
begin
to
see
the
vague
outline
of
the
larger
plant
when
we
had
reached
this
stage
in
the
development
of
animal
life
we
found
great
difficulty
in
imagining
how
the
chief
lines
of
the
higher
invertebrates
took
their
rise
from
the
archaean
chaos
of
early
forms
we
have
an
even
greater
difficulty
here
as
plant
remains
are
not
preserved
at
all
until
the
devonian
period
we
can
only
conclude
from
the
later
facts
that
these
primitive
plants
branched
out
in
several
different
directions
one
section
at
a
quite
unknown
date
adopted
an
organic
diet
and
became
the
fungi
and
a
later
or
between
a
fungus
and
a
alga
led
to
the
lichens
others
remained
at
the
and
grew
in
great
thickets
along
the
sea
bottoms
no
doubt
rivalling
or
surpassing
the
giant
sometimes
feet
long
off
the
american
coast
other
lines
which
start
from
the
level
of
the
primitive
algae
develop
into
the
mosses
bryophyta
ferns
pteridophyta
horsetails
equisetalia
and
lycopodiales
the
mosses
the
lowest
group
are
not
preserved
in
the
rocks
from
the
other
three
classes
will
come
the
great
forests
of
the
carboniferous
period
the
early
record
of
is
so
poor
that
it
is
useless
to
speculate
when
the
plant
first
left
the
water
we
have
somewhat
obscure
and
disputed
traces
of
ferns
in
the
ordovician
and
as
they
and
the
horsetails
and
are
well
developed
in
the
devonian
we
may
assume
that
some
of
the
had
become
adapted
to
life
on
land
and
evolved
into
the
early
forms
of
the
ferns
at
least
in
the
cambrian
period
from
that
time
they
begin
to
weave
a
mantle
of
sombre
green
over
the
exposed
land
and
to
play
a
most
important
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
we
saw
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
devonian
there
was
a
considerable
rise
of
the
land
both
in
america
and
europe
but
especially
in
europe
a
distant
spectator
at
that
time
would
have
observed
the
rise
of
a
chain
of
mountains
in
scotland
and
a
general
emergence
of
land
europe
a
continent
stretched
from
ireland
to
scandinavia
and
north
russia
while
most
of
the
rest
of
europe
except
large
areas
of
russia
france
germany
and
turkey
was
under
the
sea
where
we
now
find
our
alps
and
pyrenees
towering
up
to
the
there
were
then
level
stretches
of
ocean
even
the
continent
was
scooped
into
great
inland
seas
or
lagoons
which
stretched
from
ireland
to
scandinavia
and
as
we
saw
fostered
the
development
of
the
fishes
as
the
devonian
period
progressed
the
sea
gained
on
the
land
and
must
have
restricted
the
growth
of
vegetation
but
as
the
lake
deposits
now
preserve
the
remains
of
the
plants
which
grow
down
to
their
shores
or
are
washed
into
them
we
are
enabled
to
restore
the
complexion
of
the
landscape
ferns
generally
of
a
primitive
and
generalised
character
abound
and
include
the
ferns
such
as
we
find
in
warm
countries
horsetails
and
already
grow
into
there
are
even
ferns
which
give
promise
of
the
higher
plants
to
come
but
as
yet
nothing
approaching
our
flower
and
trees
has
appeared
there
is
as
yet
no
certain
indication
of
the
presence
of
conifers
it
is
a
sombre
and
monotonous
vegetation
unlike
any
to
be
found
in
any
climate
we
will
look
more
closely
into
its
nature
presently
first
let
us
see
how
these
primitive
types
of
plants
come
to
form
the
immense
forests
which
are
recorded
in
our
russel
wallace
has
lately
represented
these
forests
which
have
we
shall
see
had
a
most
important
influence
on
the
development
of
life
as
somewhat
mysterious
in
their
origin
if
however
we
again
consult
the
geologist
as
to
the
changes
which
were
taking
place
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
we
find
a
quite
natural
explanation
indeed
there
are
now
distinguished
geologists
professor
chamberlin
who
doubt
if
the
were
so
exceptionally
luxuriant
as
is
generally
believed
they
think
that
the
vegetation
may
not
have
been
more
dense
than
in
some
other
ages
but
that
there
may
have
been
exceptionally
good
conditions
for
preserving
the
dead
trees
we
shall
see
that
there
were
but
on
the
whole
it
seems
probable
that
during
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
remarkably
dense
forests
covered
enormous
stretches
of
the
surface
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
the
devonian
period
had
opened
with
a
rise
of
the
land
but
the
sea
eat
steadily
into
it
once
more
and
with
some
inconsiderable
oscillations
of
the
land
regained
its
territory
the
latter
part
of
the
devonian
and
earlier
part
of
the
carboniferous
were
remarkable
for
their
great
expanses
of
shallow
water
and
land
except
the
recent
chain
of
hills
in
scotland
we
know
of
no
mountains
professor
chamberlin
calculates
that
or
square
miles
of
the
present
continental
surface
of
europe
and
america
were
covered
with
a
shallow
sea
in
the
deeper
and
clearer
of
these
waters
the
earliest
carboniferous
rocks
of
limestone
were
deposited
the
millstone
grit
which
succeeds
the
limestone
indicates
shallower
water
which
is
being
rapidly
filled
up
with
the
debris
of
the
land
in
a
word
all
the
indications
suggest
the
early
and
middle
carboniferous
as
an
age
of
vast
swamps
of
enormous
stretches
of
land
just
above
or
below
the
and
changing
repeatedly
from
one
to
the
other
further
the
climate
was
at
the
time
we
will
consider
the
general
question
of
climate
later
moist
and
warm
all
over
the
earth
on
account
of
the
great
proportion
of
and
the
absence
of
high
land
not
to
speak
of
more
disputable
causes
these
were
ideal
conditions
for
the
primitive
vegetation
and
it
spread
over
the
swamps
with
great
vigour
to
say
that
the
were
masses
of
ferns
horsetails
and
is
a
lifeless
and
misleading
expression
the
or
lycopodiales
were
massive
trees
rising
sometimes
to
a
height
of
feet
and
probably
averaging
about
fifty
feet
in
height
and
one
or
two
feet
in
diameter
the
largest
and
most
abundant
of
them
the
sigillaria
sent
up
a
scarred
and
fluted
trunk
to
a
height
of
seventy
or
a
hundred
feet
without
a
branch
and
was
crowned
with
a
bunch
of
its
long
tapering
leaves
the
lepidodendron
its
fellow
monarch
of
the
forest
branched
at
the
summit
and
terminated
in
clusters
of
its
stiff
leaves
six
or
seven
inches
long
like
enormous
exaggerations
of
the
little
cones
at
the
ends
of
our
the
horsetails
which
linger
in
their
dwarfed
descendants
by
our
streams
and
at
their
exceptional
best
in
a
part
of
south
america
form
slender
stems
about
thirty
feet
high
were
then
four
to
six
feet
in
circumference
and
sometimes
ninety
feet
in
height
these
calamites
probably
rose
in
dense
thickets
from
the
borders
of
the
lakes
their
stumpy
leaves
spreading
in
whorls
at
every
joint
in
their
hollow
stems
another
extinct
tree
the
cordaites
rivalled
the
horsetails
and
in
height
and
its
showers
of
long
and
extraordinary
leaves
six
feet
long
and
six
inches
in
width
pointed
to
the
higher
plant
world
that
was
to
come
between
these
gaunt
towering
trunks
the
graceful
spread
their
canopies
at
heights
of
twenty
forty
and
even
sixty
feet
from
the
ground
and
at
the
base
was
a
dense
undergrowth
of
ferns
and
mosses
may
have
carpeted
the
moist
ground
but
nothing
in
the
nature
of
grass
or
flowers
had
yet
appeared
imagine
this
dense
assemblage
of
dull
flowerless
trees
pervaded
by
a
hot
dank
atmosphere
with
no
change
of
seasons
with
no
movement
but
the
flying
of
large
and
primitive
insects
among
the
trees
and
the
stirring
of
the
ferns
below
by
some
passing
giant
salamander
with
no
song
of
bird
and
no
single
streak
of
white
or
red
or
blue
drawn
across
the
changeless
sombre
green
and
you
have
some
idea
of
the
character
of
the
forests
that
are
compressed
into
our
seams
of
coal
imagine
these
forests
spread
from
spitzbergen
to
australia
and
even
according
to
the
south
polar
expeditions
to
the
antarctic
and
from
the
united
states
to
europe
to
siberia
and
to
china
and
prolonged
during
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
and
you
begin
to
realise
that
the
carboniferous
period
prepared
the
land
for
the
coming
dynasties
of
animals
let
some
vast
and
terrible
devastation
fall
upon
this
luxuriant
world
entombing
the
great
multitude
of
its
imperfect
forms
and
selecting
the
higher
types
for
freer
life
and
the
earth
will
pass
into
a
new
age
but
before
we
describe
the
animal
inhabitants
of
these
forests
the
part
that
the
forests
play
in
the
story
of
life
and
the
great
cataclysm
which
selects
the
higher
types
from
the
myriads
of
forms
which
the
warm
womb
of
the
earth
has
poured
out
we
must
at
least
glance
at
the
evolutionary
position
of
the
carboniferous
plants
themselves
do
they
point
downward
to
lower
forms
and
upward
to
higher
forms
as
the
theory
of
evolution
requires
a
close
inquiry
into
this
would
lead
us
deep
into
the
problems
of
the
modern
botanist
but
we
may
borrow
from
him
a
few
of
the
results
of
the
great
labour
he
has
expended
on
the
subject
within
the
last
decade
just
as
the
animal
world
is
primarily
divided
into
invertebrates
and
vertebrates
the
plant
world
is
primarily
divided
into
a
lower
kingdom
of
plants
the
cryptogams
and
an
upper
kingdom
of
plants
the
phanerogams
again
just
as
the
first
half
of
the
earth
story
is
the
age
of
invertebrate
animals
so
it
is
the
age
of
cryptogamous
plants
so
far
evolution
was
always
justified
in
the
plant
record
but
there
is
a
third
parallel
of
much
greater
interest
we
saw
that
at
one
time
the
evolutionist
was
puzzled
by
the
clean
division
of
animals
into
invertebrate
and
vertebrate
and
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
backbone
in
the
chronicle
he
was
just
as
much
puzzled
by
the
sharp
division
of
our
plants
into
cryptogams
and
phanerogams
and
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
latter
on
the
earth
during
the
period
and
the
issue
has
been
a
fresh
and
recent
triumph
for
evolution
plants
are
so
well
preserved
in
the
coal
that
many
years
of
microscopic
study
of
the
remains
and
patient
of
the
crushed
and
scattered
fragments
have
shown
the
carboniferous
plants
in
quite
a
new
light
instead
of
the
being
a
vast
assemblage
of
cryptogams
upon
which
the
higher
type
of
the
phanerogam
is
going
suddenly
to
descend
from
the
clouds
it
is
to
a
very
great
extent
a
world
of
plants
that
are
struggling
upward
along
many
paths
to
the
higher
level
the
characters
of
the
cryptogam
and
phanerogam
are
so
mixed
up
in
it
that
although
the
special
lines
of
development
are
difficult
to
trace
it
is
one
massive
testimony
to
the
evolution
of
the
higher
from
the
lower
the
reproductive
bodies
of
the
great
lepidodendra
are
sometimes
more
like
seeds
than
spores
while
both
the
wood
and
the
leaves
of
the
sigillaria
have
features
which
properly
belong
to
the
phanerogam
in
another
group
called
the
sphenophyllales
the
characters
of
these
giant
are
blended
with
the
characters
of
the
giant
horsetails
and
there
is
ground
to
think
that
the
three
groups
have
descended
from
an
earlier
common
ancestor
further
it
is
now
believed
that
a
large
part
of
what
were
believed
to
be
conifers
suddenly
entering
from
the
unknown
are
not
conifers
at
all
but
cordaites
the
cordaites
is
a
very
remarkable
combination
of
features
that
are
otherwise
scattered
among
the
cryptogams
cycads
and
conifers
on
the
other
hand
a
very
large
part
of
what
the
geologist
had
hitherto
called
ferns
have
turned
out
to
be
plants
half
cycad
and
half
fern
numbers
of
specimens
of
this
interesting
group
the
cycadofilices
or
pteridosperms
have
been
beautifully
restored
by
our
botanists
they
have
afforded
a
new
and
very
plausible
ancestor
for
the
higher
trees
which
come
on
the
scene
toward
the
close
of
the
while
their
characters
dispose
botanists
to
think
that
they
and
the
ferns
may
be
traced
to
a
common
ancestor
this
earlier
stage
is
lost
in
those
primitive
ages
from
which
not
a
single
leaf
has
survived
in
the
rocks
we
can
only
say
that
it
is
probable
that
the
mosses
ferns
lycopods
arose
independently
from
the
primitive
level
but
the
higher
and
more
important
development
is
now
much
clearer
the
is
not
simply
a
kingdom
of
cryptogams
it
is
a
world
of
aspiring
and
mingled
types
let
it
be
subjected
to
some
searching
test
some
tremendous
spell
of
adversity
and
we
shall
understand
the
emergence
of
the
higher
types
out
of
the
luxuriant
profusion
and
confusion
of
forms

comes
as
it
will
in
the
next
chapter
the
animal
world
also
offers
a
luxuriant
variety
of
forms
from
which
the
higher
types
may
be
selected
this
it
need
hardly
be
said
is
just
what
we
find

record

and

of
carnivores

to

probably
proceeded
throughout
the

period

from
the

of

was

animal
population
on
the
land
like
the
plants
moreover
these
animals
were
of
an
intermediate
and
advancing
nature
no
bird
or
butterfly
yet
flits
from
tree
to
tree
no
mammal
rears
its
young
in
the
shelter
of
the
ferns
but
among
the
swarming
population
are
many
types
that
show
a
beginning
of
higher
organisation
and
there
is
a
rich
and
varied
material
provided
for
the
coming
selection
the
monarch
of
the
carboniferous
forest
is
the
amphibian
in
that
age
of
spreading
swamps
and
dim
watery
woodlands
the
stupid
and
sluggish
amphibian
finds
his
golden
age
and
except
perhaps
the
scorpion
there
is
no
other
land
animal
competent
to
dispute
his
rule
even
the
scorpion
moreover
would
not
find
the
carboniferous
amphibian
very
vulnerable
we
must
not
think
of
the
frogs
and
toads
and
innocent
newts
which
represent
the
fallen
race
of
the
amphibia
they
were
then
heavily
armoured
powerfully
armed
and
sometimes
as
large
as
alligators
or
young
crocodiles
it
is
a
characteristic
of
advancing
life
that
a
new
type
of
organism
has
its
period
of
triumph
grows
to
enormous
proportions
and
spreads
into
many
different
types
until
the
next
higher
stage
of
life
is
reached
and
it
is
dethroned
by
the
the
first
indication
apart
from
certain
disputed
impressions
in
the
devonian
of
the
is
the
footprint
of
an
amphibian
on
an
early
carboniferous
hardened
by
the
sun
and
then
covered
with
a
fresh
deposit
when
it
sank
beneath
the
waters
it
remains
to
witness
the
arrival
of
the
quadruped
who
was
to
rule
the
earth
as
the
period
proceeds
remains
are
found
in
great
abundance
and
we
see
that
there
must
have
been
a
vast
and
varied
population
of
the
amphibia
on
the
shores
of
the
carboniferous
lagoons
and
swamps
there
were
at
least
twenty
genera
of
them
living
in
what
is
now
the
island
of
britain
and
was
then
part
of
the
continent
some
of
them
were
short
and
stumpy
creatures
a
few
inches
long
with
weak
limbs
and
short
tails
and
broad
heads
their
bodies
clothed
in
the
fine
scaly
armour
of
their
the
branchiosaurs
some
the
aistopods
were
long
creatures
with
shrunken
limbs
and
bodies
drawn
out
until
in
some
cases
the
backbone
had
vertebrae
they
seem
to
have
taken
to
the
thickets
in
the
growing
competition
as
the
serpents
did
later
and
lost
the
use
of
their
limbs
which
would
be
merely
an
encumbrance
in
winding
among
the
roots
and
branches
some
the
microsaurs
were
agile
little
organisms
with
strong
bony
frames
and
relatively
long
and
useful
legs
they
look
as
if
they
may
even
have
climbed
the
trees
in
pursuit
of
snails
and
insects
a
fourth
and
more
formidable
the
labyrinthodonts
which
take
their
name
from
the
labyrinthine
folds
of
the
enamel
in
their
strong
teeth
were
commonly
several
feet
in
length
some
of
them
attained
a
length
of
seven
or
eight
feet
and
had
plates
of
bone
over
their
heads
and
bellies
while
the
jaws
in
their
enormous
heads
were
loaded
with
their
strong
labyrinthine
teeth
life
on
land
was
becoming
as
eventful
and
stimulating
as
life
in
the
waters
the
general
characteristic
of
these
early
amphibia
is
that
they
very
clearly
retain
the
marks
of
their
fish
ancestry
all
of
them
have
tails
all
of
them
have
either
scales
or
like
many
of
the
fishes
plates
of
bone
protecting
the
body
in
some
of
the
younger
specimens
the
gills
can
still
be
clearly
traced
but
no
doubt
they
were
mainly
we
have
seen
how
the
fish
obtained
its
lungs
and
need
add
only
that
this
change
in
the
method
of
obtaining
oxygen
for
the
blood
involved
certain
further
changes
of
a
very
important
nature
following
the
fossil
record
we
do
not
observe
the
changes
which
are
taking
place
in
the
soft
internal
organs
but
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
them
the
heart
for
instance
which
began
as
a
simple
muscular
expansion
or
distension
of
one
of
the
of
some
primitive
worm
then
doubled
and
became
a
pump
in
the
fish
now
develops
a
partition
in
the
auricle
upper
chamber
so
that
the
aerated
blood
is
to
some
extent
separated
from
the
venous
blood
this
approach
toward
the
type
begins
in
the
and
is
connected
with
the
development
of
the
lungs
corresponding
changes
take
place
in
the
arteries
and
we
shall
find
that
this
change
in
structure
is
of
very
great
importance
in
the
evolution
of
the
higher
types
of
the
heart
of
the
higher
we
may
add
passes
through
these
stages
in
its
embryonic
development
externally
the
chief
change
in
the
amphibian
is
the
appearance
of
definite
legs
the
broad
paddle
of
the
fin
is
now
useless
and
its
main
stem
is
converted
into
a
jointed
bony
limb
with
a
foot
spreading
into
a
paddle
at
the
end
but
the
legs
are
still
feeble
sprawling
supports
letting
the
heavy
body
down
almost
to
the
ground
the
amphibian
is
an
imperfect
but
necessary
stage
in
evolution
it
is
an
improvement
on
the
dipneust
fish
which
now
begins
to
dwindle
very
considerably
in
the
geological
record
but
it
is
itself
doomed
to
give
way
speedily
before
one
of
its
more
advanced
descendants
the
reptile
probably
the
giant
salamander
of
modern
japan
affords
the
best
suggestion
of
the
large
and
primitive
salamanders
of
the
while
the
caecilia
amphibia
with
scaly
skins
which
live
underground
in
south
america
may
not
impossibly
be
degenerate
survivors
of
the
curious
aistopods
our
modern
tailless
amphibia
frogs
and
toads
appear
much
later
in
the
story
of
the
earth
but
they
are
not
without
interest
here
on
account
of
the
remarkable
capacity
which
they
show
to
adapt
themselves
to
different
surroundings
there
are
frogs
like
the
of
martinique
and
others
in
regions
where
water
is
scarce
which
never
pass
through
the
tadpole
stage
or
to
be
quite
accurate
they
lose
the
gills
and
tail
in
the
egg
as
higher
do
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
modern
amphibian
the
axolotl
of
mexico
which
retains
the
gills
throughout
life
and
never
lives
on
land
gadow
has
shown
that
the
lake
in
which
it
lives
is
so
rich
in
food
that
it
has
little
inducement
to
leave
it
for
the
land
transferred
to
a
different
environment
it
may
pass
to
the
land
and
lose
its
gills
these
adaptations
help
us
to
understand
the
rich
variety
of
amphibian
forms
that
appeared
in
the
changing
conditions
of
the
carboniferous
world
when
we
think
of
the
diet
of
the
amphibia
we
are
reminded
of
the
other
prominent
representatives
of
land
life
at
the
time
snails
spiders
and
myriapods
crept
over
the
ground
or
along
the
stalks
of
the
trees
and
a
vast
population
of
insects
filled
the
air
we
find
a
few
stray
wings
in
the
silurian
and
a
large
number
of
wings
and
fragments
in
the
devonian
but
it
is
in
the
that
we
find
the
first
great
expansion
of
insect
life
with
a
considerable
development
of
myriapods
spiders
and
scorpions
food
was
enormously
abundant
and
the
insect
at
least
had
no
rival
in
the
air
for
neither
bird
nor
flying
reptile
had
yet
appeared
hence
we
find
the
same
generous
growth
as
amongst
the
amphibia
large
primitive
had
wings
four
or
five
inches
long
great
creatures
had
fat
bodies
sometimes
twenty
inches
in
length
and
soared
on
wings
of
remarkable
breadth
or
crawled
on
their
six
long
sprawling
legs
more
than
a
thousand
species
of
insects
and
nearly
a
hundred
species
of
spiders
and
fifty
of
myriapods
are
found
in
the
remains
of
the
from
the
evolutionary
point
of
view
these
new
classes
are
as
obscure
in
their
origin
yet
as
manifestly
undergoing
evolution
when
they
do
fully
appear
as
the
earlier
classes
we
have
considered
all
are
of
a
primitive
and
generalised
character
that
is
to
say
characters
which
are
distributed
among
widely
different
groups
were
then
concentrated
and
mingled
in
one
common
ancestor
out
of
which
the
later
groups
will
develop
all
belong
to
the
lowest
orders
of
their
class
no
hymenopters
ants
bees
and
wasps
or
coleopters
beetles
are
found
in
the
and
it
will
be
many
millions
of
years
before
the
graceful
butterfly
enlivens
the
landscapes
of
the
earth
the
early
insects
nearly
all
belong
to
the
lower
orders
of
the
orthopters
cockroaches
crickets
locusts
etc
and
neuropters
a
few
traces
of
hemipters
now
mainly
represented
by
the
degenerate
bugs
are
found
but
of
the
carboniferous
insects
belong
to
the
lowest
orders
of
their
class
the
orthopters
and
neuropters
in
fact
they
are
such
primitive
and
generalised
insects
and
so
frequently
mingle
the
characteristics
of
the
two
orders
that
one
of
the
highest
authorities
scudder
groups
them
in
a
special
and
extinct
order
the
palmodictyoptera
though
this
view
is
not
now
generally
adopted
we
shall
find
the
higher
orders
of
insects
making
their
appearance
in
succession
as
the
story
proceeds
thus
far
then
the
insects
of
the
are
in
entire
harmony
with
the
principle
of
evolution
but
when
we
try
to
trace
their
origin
and
earlier
relations
our
task
is
beset
with
difficulties
it
goes
without
saying
that
such
delicate
frames
as
those
of
the
earlier
insects
had
very
little
chance
of
being
preserved
in
the
rocks
until
the
special
conditions
of
the
set
in
we
are
therefore
quite
prepared
to
hear
that
the
geologist
can
not
give
us
the
slenderest
information
he
finds
the
wing
of
what
he
calls
the
primitive
bug
protocimex
an
hemipterous
insect
in
the
later
ordovician
and
the
wing
of
a
primitive
cockroach
palaeoblattina
in
the
silurian
from
these
we
can
merely
conclude
that
insects
were
already
numerous
and
varied
but
we
have
already
in
similar
difficulties
received
assistance
from
the
science
of
zoology
and
we
now
obtain
from
that
science
a
most
important
clue
to
the
evolution
of
the
insect
in
south
america
south
africa
and
australasia
which
were
at
one
time
connected
by
a
great
southern
continent
we
find
a
little
creature
which
the
zoologist
regards
with
profound
interest
it
is
so
curious
that
he
has
been
obliged
to
create
a
special
class
for
it
alone
a
distinction
which
will
be
appreciated
when
i
mention
that
the
neighbouring
class
of
the
insects
contains
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
living
species
this
valuable
little
animal
with
its
tiny
head
round
elongated
body
and
many
pairs
of
legs
was
until
a
few
decades
ago
regarded
as
an
annelid
like
the
it
has
in
point
of
fact
the
peculiar
nephridia
and
other
features
of
the
annelid
but
a
closer
study
discovered
in
it
a
character
that
separated
it
far
from
any
it
was
found
to
breathe
the
air
by
means
of
tracheae
little
tubes
running
inward
from
the
surface
of
the
body
as
the
myriapods
spiders
and
insects
do
it
was
in
other
words
a
kind
of
animal
between
the
arthropods
and
the
annelids
cambridge
natural
history
iv
a
surviving
kink
in
the
lost
chain
of
the
ancestry
of
the
insect
through
millions
of
years
it
has
preserved
a
primitive
frame
that
really
belongs
to
the
cambrian
if
not
an
earlier
age
it
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
living
fossils
in
the
museum
of
nature
peripatus
as
the
little
animal
is
called
points
very
clearly
to
an
annelid
ancestor
of
all
the
tracheates
the
myriapods
spiders
and
insects
or
all
the
animals
that
breathe
by
means
of
trachere
to
understand
its
significance
we
must
glance
once
more
at
an
early
chapter
in
the
story
of
life
we
saw
that
a
vast
and
varied
wormlike
population
must
have
filled
the
archaean
ocean
and
that
all
the
higher
lines
of
animal
development
start
from
one
or
other
point
in
this
broad
kingdom
the
annelids
in
which
the
body
consists
of
a
long
series
of
connected
rings
or
segments
as
in
the
are
one
of
the
highest
groups
of
these
creatures
and
some
branch
of
them
developed
a
pair
of
feet
as
in
the
caterpillar
on
each
segment
of
the
body
and
a
tough
chitinous
coat
thus
arose
the
early
arthropods
on
jointed
articulated
animals
some
of
these
remained
in
the
water
breathing
by
means
of
gills
and
became
the
crustacea
some
however
migrated
to
the
land
and
developed
what
we
may
almost
call
lungs
little
tubes
entering
the
body
at
the
skin
and
branching
internally
to
bring
the
air
into
contact
with
the
blood
the
tracheae
in
peripatus
we
have
a
strange
survivor
of
these
primitive
of
many
million
years
ago
the
simple
nature
of
its
breathing
apparatus
suggests
that
the
trachere
were
developed
out
of
glands
in
the
skin
just
as
the
fish
when
it
came
on
land
probably
developed
lungs
from
its
swimming
bladders
the
primitive
tracheates
delivered
from
the
increasing
carnivores
of
the
waters
grew
into
a
large
and
varied
family
as
all
such
new
types
do
in
favourable
surroundings
from
them
in
the
course
of
time
were
evolved
the
three
great
classes
of
the
myriapods
millipedes
and
centipedes
the
arachnids
scorpions
spiders
and
mites
and
the
insects
i
will
not
enter
into
the
and
obscure
question
of
their
nearer
relationship
some
derive
the
insects
from
the
myriapods
some
the
myriapods
from
the
insects
and
some
think
they
evolved
independently
while
the
rise
of
the
spiders
and
scorpions
is
even
more
obscure
but
how
can
we
see
any
trace
of
an
annelid
ancestor
in
the
vastly
different
frames
of
these
animals
which
are
said
to
descend
from
it
it
is
not
so
difficult
as
it
seems
to
be
at
first
sight
in
the
myriapod
we
still
have
the
elongated
body
and
successive
pairs
of
legs
in
the
arachnid
the
legs
are
reduced
in
number
and
lengthened
while
the
various
segments
of
the
body
are
fused
in
two
distinct
the
thorax
and
the
abdomen
in
the
insect
we
have
a
similar
concentration
of
the
primitive
long
body
the
abdomen
is
composed
of
a
large
number
usually
nine
or
ten
of
segments
which
have
lost
their
legs
and
fused
together
in
the
thorax
three
segments
are
still
distinctly
traceable
with
three
pairs
of
legs
now
long
jointed
limbs
as
in
the
caterpillar
ancestor
in
the
carboniferous
insect
these
three
joints
in
the
thorax
are
particularly
clear
in
the
head
four
or
five
segments
are
fused
together
their
limbs
have
been
modified
into
the
jaws
or
other
and
their
separate
have
combined
to
form
the
large
ring
of
round
the
gullet
which
represents
the
brain
of
the
insect
how
then
do
we
account
for
the
wings
of
the
insect
here
we
can
offer
nothing
more
than
speculation
but
the
speculation
is
not
without
interest
it
may
be
laid
down
in
principle
that
the
flying
animal
begins
as
a
leaping
animal
the
flying
fish
may
serve
to
suggest
an
early
stage
in
the
development
of
wings
it
is
a
leaping
fish
its
extended
fins
merely
buoying
it
like
the
surfaces
of
an
aeroplane
and
so
prolonging
its
leap
away
from
its
pursuer
but
the
great
difficulty
is
to
imagine
any
part
of
the
primitive
insect
apart
from
the
limbs
and
the
wings
of
the
insect
are
not
developed
from
legs
like
those
of
the
bird
which
might
have
even
an
initial
usefulness
in
buoying
the
body
as
it
leaped
it
has
been
suggested
therefore
that
the
primitive
insect
returned
to
the
water
as
the
whale
and
seal
did
in
the
struggle
for
life
of
a
later
period
the
fact
that
the
mayfly
and
spend
their
youth
in
the
water
is
thought
to
confirm
this
returning
to
the
water
the
primitive
insects
would
develop
gills
like
the
crustacea
after
a
time
the
stress
of
life
in
the
water
drove
them
back
to
the
land
and
the
gills
became
useless
but
the
folds
or
scales
of
the
tough
coat
which
had
covered
the
gills
would
remain
as
projecting
planes
and
are
thought
to
have
been
the
rudiment
from
which
a
long
period
of
selection
evolved
the
huge
wings
of
the
early
and
mayflies
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
wingless
order
of
insects
aptera
have
not
lost
but
had
never
developed
wings
and
that
the
insects
with
only
one
or
two
pairs
all
descend
from
an
ancestor
with
three
pairs
the
early
date
of
their
origin
the
delicacy
of
their
structure
and
the
peculiar
form
which
their
larval
development
has
generally
assumed
combine
to
obscure
the
evolution
of
the
insect
and
we
must
be
content
for
the
present
with
these
general
indications
the
vast
unexplored
regions
of
africa
south
america
and
central
australia
may
yet
yield
further
clues
and
the
riddle
of
may
some
day
betray
the
secrets
which
it
must
hold
for
the
moment
the
carboniferous
insects
interest
us
as
a
rich
material
for
the
operation
of
a
coming
natural
selection
on
them
as
on
all
other
carboniferous
life
a
great
trial
is
about
to
fall
a
very
small
proportion
of
them
will
survive
that
trial
and
they
trill
be
the
better
organised
to
maintain
themselves
and
rear
their
young
in
the
new
earth
the
remaining
of
the
is
confined
to
organisms
whose
remains
are
not
preserved
and
which
do
not
call
for
further
discussion
we
may
in
conclusion
glance
at
the
progress
of
life
in
the
waters
apart
from
the
appearance
of
the
great
fishes
and
crustacea
the
carboniferous
period
was
one
of
great
stimulation
to
aquatic
life
constant
changes
were
taking
place
in
the
level
and
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
the
aspect
of
our
coal
seams
alternating
between
thick
layers
of
sand
and
mud
shows
a
remarkable
oscillation
of
the
land
many
recent
authorities
have
questioned
whether
the
trees
grew
on
the
sites
where
we
find
them
and
were
not
rather
washed
down
into
the
lagoons
and
shallow
waters
from
higher
ground
in
that
case
we
could
not
too
readily
imagine
the
region
sinking
below
the
waves
being
buried
under
the
deposits
of
the
rivers
and
then
emerging
thousands
of
years
later
to
receive
once
more
the
thick
mantle
of
sombre
vegetation
probably
there
was
less
rising
and
falling
of
the
crust
than
earlier
geologists
imagined
but
as
one
of
the
most
recent
and
most
critical
authorities
professor
chamberlin
observes
the
comparative
purity
of
the
coal
the
fairly
uniform
thickness
of
the
seams
the
bed
of
clay
representing
soil
at
their
base
the
frequency
with
which
the
stumps
are
still
found
growing
upright
as
in
the
remarkable
exposed
surface
in
glasgow
at
the
present
the
perfectly
preserved
fronds
and
the
general
mixture
of
flora
make
it
highly
probable
that
the
generally
marks
the
actual
site
of
a
and
there
were
considerable
vicissitudes
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
great
areas
of
land
repeatedly
passed
beneath
the
waters
instead
of
a
of
the
land
however
we
may
suppose
that
the
shallow
water
was
gradually
filled
with
silt
and
debris
from
the
land
and
a
fresh
forest
grew
over
it
the
civic
authorities
of
glasgow
have
wisely
exposed
and
protected
this
instructive
piece
of
in
one
of
their
parks
i
noticed
however
that
in
the
admirable
printed
information
they
supply
to
the
public
they
describe
the
trees
as
at
least
several
hundred
thousand
years
old
there
is
no
authority
in
the
world
who
would
grant
less
than
ten
million
years
since
the
period
these
changes
are
reflected
in
the
progress
of
marine
life
though
their
influence
is
probably
less
than
that
of
the
great
carnivorous
monsters
which
now
fill
the
waters
the
heavy
arthrodirans
languish
and
disappear
the
sharks
which
at
first
represent
of
the
elasmobranchs
dwindle
in
turn
and
in
the
formidable
spines
which
develop
on
them
we
may
see
evidence
of
the
great
struggle
with
the
sharks
which
are
displacing
them
the
ostracoderms
die
out
in
the
presence
of
these
competitors
the
smaller
fishes
generally
crossopterygii
seem
to
live
mainly
in
the
inland
and
shore
waters
and
advance
steadily
toward
the
modern
types
but
none
of
our
modern
bony
fishes
have
yet
appeared
more
evident
still
is
the
effect
of
the
new
conditions
upon
the
crustacea
the
trilobite
once
the
master
of
the
seas
slowly
yields
to
the
stronger
competitors
and
the
latter
part
of
the
carboniferous
period
sees
the
last
genus
of
trilobites
finally
extinguished
the
eurypterids
large
crustacea
several
feet
long
suffer
equally
and
are
represented
by
a
few
lingering
species
the
stress
favours
the
development
of
new
and
more
highly
organised
crustacea
one
is
the
limulus
or
which
seems
to
be
a
descendant
or
near
relative
of
the
trilobite
and
has
survived
until
modern
times
others
announce
the
coming
of
the
crustacea
of
the
lobster
and
shrimp
type
they
had
primitive
representatives
in
the
earlier
periods
but
seem
to
have
been
overshadowed
by
the
trilobites
and
eurypterids
as
these
in
turn
are
crushed
the
more
highly
organised
malacostraca
take
the
lead
and
primitive
specimens
of
the
shrimp
and
lobster
make
their
appearance
the
echinoderms
are
still
mainly
represented
by
the
the
rocks
which
are
composed
of
their
remains
show
that
vast
areas
of
the
must
have
been
covered
with
groves
of
bending
on
their
long
flexible
stalks
and
waving
their
great
arms
in
the
water
to
attract
food
with
them
there
is
now
a
new
experiment
in
the
stalked
echinoderm
the
blastoid
an
armless
type
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
failure
are
now
found
in
the
deposits
and
although
their
remains
are
not
common
we
may
conclude
that
the
were
scattered
over
the
floor
of
the
sea
for
the
rest
we
need
only
observe
that
progress
and
rich
diversity
of
forms
characterise
the
other
groups
of
animals
the
corals
now
form
great
reefs
and
the
finer
corals
are
gaining
upon
the
coarser
the
foraminifers
the
animals
begin
to
form
thick
rocks
with
their
dead
skeletons
the
radiolaria
the
microbes
are
so
abundant
that
more
than
twenty
genera
of
them
have
been
distinguished
in
cornwall
and
devonshire
the
brachiopods
and
molluscs
still
abound
but
the
molluscs
begin
to
outnumber
the
lower
type
of
in
the
cephalopods
we
find
an
increasing
complication
of
the
structure
of
the
great
types
such
is
the
life
of
the
carboniferous
period
the
world
rejoices
in
a
tropical
luxuriance
vegetation
is
found
in
spitzbergen
and
the
antarctic
as
well
as
in
north
europe
asia
and
america
and
in
australasia
corals
and
flourish
at
any
part
of
the
surface
warm
dank
lands
bathed
by
warm
oceans
and
steeped
in
their
vapours
are
the
picture
suggested
as
we
shall
see
more
closely
to
the
minds
of
all
geologists
in
those
happy
conditions
the
primitive
life
of
the
earth
erupts
into
an
abundance
and
variety
that
are
fitly
illustrated
in
the
vegetation
of
the
forest
and
when
the
earth
has
at
length
flooded
its
surface
with
this
seething
tide
of
life
when
the
air
is
filled
with
a
thousand
species
of
insects
and
the
feels
the
heavy
tread
of
the
giant
salamander
and
the
light
feet
of
spiders
scorpions
centipedes
and
snails
and
the
lagoons
and
shores
teem
with
animals
the
golden
age
begins
to
close
and
all
the
luxuriance
is
banished
a
great
doom
is
pronounced
on
the
swarming
life
of
the
period
and
from
every
hundred
species
of
its
animals
and
plants
only
two
or
three
will
survive
the
searching
test
chapter
x
the
permian
revolution
in
an
earlier
chapter
it
was
stated
that
the
story
of
life
is
a
story
of
gradual
and
continuous
advance
with
occasional
periods
of
more
rapid
progress
hitherto
it
has
been
in
these
pages
a
slow
and
even
advance
from
one
geological
age
to
another
one
level
of
organisation
to
another
this
it
is
true
must
not
be
taken
too
literally
many
a
period
of
rapid
change
is
probably
contained
and
blurred
out
of
recognition
in
that
long
chronicle
of
geological
events
when
a
region
sinks
slowly
below
the
waves
no
matter
how
insensible
the
subsidence
may
be
there
will
often
come
a
time
of
sudden
and
vast
inundations
as
the
higher
ridges
of
the
coast
just
dip
below
the
and
the
lower
interior
is
flooded
when
two
invading
arms
of
the
sea
meet
at
last
in
the
interior
of
the
sinking
continent
or
when
a
that
has
for
millions
of
years
separated
two
seas
and
their
populations
is
obliterated
we
have
a
similar
occurrence
of
sudden
and
change
the
whole
story
of
the
earth
is
punctuated
with
small
cataclysms
but
we
now
come
to
a
change
so
penetrating
so
widespread
and
so
calamitous
that
in
spite
of
its
slowness
we
may
venture
to
call
it
a
revolution
indeed
we
may
say
of
the
remaining
story
of
the
earth
that
it
is
characterised
by
three
such
revolutions
separated
by
millions
of
years
which
are
very
largely
responsible
for
the
appearance
of
higher
types
of
life
the
facts
are
very
well
illustrated
by
an
analogy
drawn
from
the
recent
and
familiar
history
of
europe
the
conditions
of
europe
in
the
eighteenth
century
which
were
still
tainted
with
feudalism
were
changed
into
the
conditions
of
the
modern
world
partly
by
a
slow
and
continuous
evolution
but
much
more
by
three
revolutionary
movements
first
there
was
the
great
upheaval
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
tremors
of
which
were
felt
in
the
life
of
every
country
in
europe
then
although
as
freeman
says
no
part
of
europe
ever
returned
entirely
to
its
former
condition
there
was
a
profound
and
almost
universal
reaction
in
the
and
differing
in
different
countries
a
second
revolutionary
disturbance
shook
europe
the
reaction
after
this
upheaval
was
far
less
severe
and
the
conditions
were
permanently
changed
to
a
great
extent
but
a
third
revolutionary
movement
followed
in
the
next
generation
and
from
that
time
the
evolution
of
conditions
has
proceeded
more
evenly
the
story
of
life
on
the
earth
since
the
period
is
similarly
quickened
by
three
revolutions
the
first
at
the
close
of
the
carboniferous
period
is
the
subject
of
this
chapter
it
is
the
most
drastic
and
devastating
of
the
three
but
its
effect
at
least
on
the
animal
world
will
be
materially
checked
by
a
profound
and
protracted
reaction
at
the
end
of
the
chalk
period
some
millions
of
years
later
there
will
be
a
second
revolution
and
it
will
have
a
far
more
enduring
and
conspicuous
result
though
it
seem
less
drastic
at
the
time
yet
there
will
be
something
of
a
reaction
after
a
time
and
at
length
a
third
revolution
will
inaugurate
the
age
of
man
if
it
is
clearly
understood
that
instead
of
a
century
we
are
contemplating
a
period
of
at
least
ten
million
years
and
instead
of
a
decade
of
revolution
we
have
a
change
spread
over
a
hundred
thousand
years
or
more
this
analogy
will
serve
to
convey
a
most
important
truth
the
revolutionary
agency
that
broke
into
the
comparatively
even
chronicle
of
life
near
the
close
of
the
carboniferous
period
dethroned
its
older
types
of
organisms
and
ushered
new
types
to
the
lordship
of
the
earth
was
cold
the
reader
will
begin
to
understand
why
i
dwelt
on
the
aspect
of
the
and
its
surrounding
waters
there
was
then
a
warm
moist
earth
from
pole
to
pole
not
even
temporarily
chilled
and
stiffened
by
a
few
months
of
winter
and
life
spread
luxuriantly
in
the
perpetual
summer
then
a
spell
of
cold
so
severe
and
protracted
grips
the
earth
that
glaciers
glitter
on
the
flanks
of
indian
and
australian
hills
and
fields
of
ice
spread
over
what
are
now
semitropical
regions
in
some
degree
the
cold
penetrates
the
whole
earth
the
rich
forests
shrink
slowly
into
thin
tracts
of
scrubby
vegetation
the
loss
of
food
and
the
bleak
and
exacting
conditions
of
the
new
earth
annihilate
thousands
of
species
of
the
older
organisms
and
the
more
progressive
types
are
moulded
into
fitness
for
the
new
environment
it
is
a
colossal
application
of
natural
selection
and
amongst
its
results
are
some
of
great
moment
in
various
recent
works
one
reads
that
earlier
geologists
led
astray
by
the
nebular
theory
of
the
earth
origin
probably
erred
very
materially
in
regard
to
the
climate
of
primordial
times
and
that
climate
has
varied
less
than
used
to
be
supposed
it
must
not
be
thought
that
in
speaking
of
a
permian
revolution
i
am
ignoring
or
defying
this
view
of
many
distinguished
geologists
i
am
taking
careful
account
of
it
there
is
no
dispute
however
about
the
fact
that
the
permian
age
witnessed
an
immense
carnage
of
carboniferous
organisms
and
a
very
considerable
modification
of
those
organisms
which
survived
the
catastrophe
and
that
the
great
agency
in
this
annihilation
and
transformation
was
cold
to
prevent
misunderstanding
nevertheless
it
will
be
useful
to
explain
the
controversy
about
the
climate
of
the
earth
in
past
ages
which
divides
modern
geologists
the
root
of
the
difference
of
opinion
and
the
character
of
the
conflicting
parties
have
already
been
indicated
it
is
a
protest
of
the
planetesimalists
against
the
older
and
still
general
view
of
the
origin
of
the
earth
as
we
saw
that
view
implies
that
as
the
heavier
elements
penetrated
centreward
in
the
condensing
nebula
the
gases
were
left
as
a
surrounding
shell
of
atmosphere
it
was
a
mixed
mass
of
gases
chiefly
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
popularly
known
as
carbonic
acid
gas
when
the
settled
as
ocean
on
the
crust
the
atmosphere
remained
a
very
dense
mixture
of
oxygen
nitrogen
and
to
neglect
the
minor
gases
this
heavy
proportion
of
would
cause
the
atmosphere
to
act
as
a
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
as
it
does
still
to
some
extent
experiment
has
shown
that
an
atmosphere
containing
much
vapour
and
lets
the
pass
through
when
they
are
accompanied
by
strong
light
but
checks
them
when
they
are
separated
from
the
light
in
other
words
the
primitive
atmosphere
would
allow
the
heat
of
the
sun
to
penetrate
it
and
then
as
the
ground
absorbed
the
light
would
retain
a
large
proportion
of
the
heat
hence
the
nature
of
the
primitive
earth
the
moisture
the
dense
clouds
and
constant
rains
that
are
usually
ascribed
to
it
this
condition
lasted
until
the
rocks
and
the
forests
of
the
carboniferous
age
absorbed
enormous
quantities
of
cleared
the
atmosphere
and
prepared
an
age
of
chill
and
dryness
such
as
we
find
in
the
permian
but
the
planetesimal
hypothesis
has
no
room
for
this
enormous
percentage
of
in
the
primitive
atmosphere
hinc
illoe
lachrymoe
in
plain
english
hence
the
acute
quarrel
about
primitive
climate
and
the
close
scanning
of
the
geological
chronicle
for
indications
that
the
earth
was
not
moist
and
warm
until
the
end
of
the
carboniferous
period
once
more
i
do
not
wish
to
enfeeble
the
general
soundness
of
this
account
of
the
evolution
of
life
by
relying
on
any
controverted
theory
and
we
shall
find
it
possible
to
avoid
taking
sides
i
have
not
referred
to
the
climate
of
the
earth
in
earlier
ages
except
to
mention
that
there
are
traces
of
a
local
about
the
middle
of
the
archaean
and
the
beginning
of
the
cambrian
as
these
are
many
millions
of
years
removed
from
each
other
and
from
the
carboniferous
it
is
possible
that
they
represent
earlier
periods
more
or
less
corresponding
to
the
permian
but
the
early
chronicle
is
so
compressed
and
so
imperfectly
studied
as
yet
that
it
is
premature
to
discuss
the
point
it
is
moreover
unnecessary
because
we
know
of
no
life
on
land
in
those
remote
periods
and
it
is
only
in
connection
with
life
on
land
that
we
are
interested
in
changes
of
climate
here
in
other
words
as
far
as
the
present
study
is
concerned
we
need
only
regard
the
climate
of
the
devonian
and
carboniferous
periods
as
to
this
there
is
no
dispute
nor
in
fact
about
the
climate
from
the
cambrian
to
the
permian
as
the
new
school
is
most
brilliantly
represented
by
professor
chamberlin
it
will
be
enough
to
quote
him
he
says
of
the
cambrian
that
apart
from
the
glacial
indications
in
its
early
part
the
testimony
of
the
fossils
wherever
gathered
implies
nearly
uniform
climatic
conditions
throughout
all
the
earth
wherever
records
of
the
cambrian
period
are
preserved
ii
of
the
ordovician
he
says
all
that
is
known
of
the
life
of
this
era
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
climate
was
much
more
uniform
than
now
throughout
the
areas
where
the
strata
of
the
period
are
known
ii
in
the
silurian
we
have
much
to
suggest
uniformity
of
climate
in
fact
we
have
just
the
same
evidence
for
it
and
in
the
devonian
when
abound
and
afford
better
evidence
we
find
the
same
climatic
equality
of
living
things
in
the
most
different
latitudes
finally
most
of
the
data
at
hand
indicate
that
the
climate
of
the
lower
carboniferous
was
essentially
uniform
and
on
the
whole
both
genial
and
moist
ii
the
data
we
may
recall
are
in
this
case
enormously
abundant
and
indicate
the
climate
of
the
earth
from
the
arctic
regions
to
the
antarctic
another
recent
and
critical
geologist
professor
walther
geschichte
der
erde
und
des
lebens
admits
that
the
shows
a
uniformly
warm
climate
from
spitzbergen
to
africa
drew
the
romance
of
modern
geology
says
that
nearly
all
over
the
globe
the
climate
was
the
same
hot
close
moist
muggy
an
apology
is
due
here
in
some
measure
the
work
which
i
quote
as
of
professor
chamberlin
geology
is
really
by
two
authors
professors
chamberlin
and
salisbury
i
merely
quote
professor
chamberlin
for
shortness
and
because
the
particular
ideas
i
refer
to
are
expounded
by
him
in
separate
papers
the
work
is
the
finest
manual
in
modern
geological
literature
i
have
used
it
much
in
conjunction
with
the
latest
editions
of
geikie
le
conte
and
lupparent
and
such
recent
manuals
as
walther
de
launay
suess
and
the
geological
magazines
the
exception
which
professor
chamberlin
has
in
mind
when
he
says
most
of
the
data
is
that
we
find
deposits
of
salt
and
gypsum
in
the
silurian
and
lower
carboniferous
and
these
seem
to
point
to
the
evaporation
of
lakes
in
a
dry
climate
he
admits
that
these
indicate
at
the
most
local
areas
or
periods
of
dryness
in
an
overwhelmingly
moist
and
warm
earth
it
is
thus
not
disputed
that
the
climate
of
the
earth
was
during
a
period
of
at
least
fifteen
million
years
from
the
cambrian
to
the
carboniferous
singularly
uniform
genial
and
moist
during
that
vast
period
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
that
the
earth
was
divided
into
climatic
zones
or
that
the
year
was
divided
into
seasons
to
such
an
earth
was
the
prolific
life
of
the
adapted
it
is
further
not
questioned
that
the
temperature
of
the
earth
fell
in
the
latter
part
of
the
carboniferous
age
and
that
the
cold
reached
its
climax
in
the
permian
as
we
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
geological
chronicle
an
extraordinary
change
comes
over
the
vegetation
of
the
earth
the
great
lepidodendra
gradually
disappear
before
the
close
of
the
permian
period
the
sigillariae
dwindle
into
a
meagre
and
expiring
race
the
giant
horsetails
calamites
shrink
and
betray
the
adverse
conditions
in
their
thin
impoverished
leaves
new
stunted
hardy
trees
make
their
appearance
the
walchia
a
tree
something
like
the
low
araucarian
conifers
in
the
texture
of
its
wood
and
the
voltzia
the
reputed
ancestor
of
the
cypresses
their
narrow
stunted
leaves
suggest
to
the
imagination
the
struggle
of
a
handful
of
pines
on
a
bleak
the
rich
is
laid
waste
the

out
and
a
new
and
hardy
type
of

with
compact
leaves
the
glossopteris
spreads
victoriously
over
the
globe
from
australia
it
travels
northward
to
russia
which
it
reaches
in
the
early
permian
and
westward
across
the
southern
continent
to
south
america
a
profoundly
destructive
influence
has
fallen
on
the
earth
and
converted
its
rich
green
forests
in
which
the
mighty
had
reared
their
crowns
above
a
sea
of
waving
ferns
into
severe
and
deserts
no
botanist
hesitates
to
say
that
it
is
the
coming
of
a
cold
dry
climate
that
has
thus
changed
the
face
of
the
earth
the
geologist
finds
more
direct
evidence
in
the
werribee
gorge
in
victoria
i
have
seen
the
marks
which
australian
geologists
have
discovered
of
the
which
put
an
end
to
their
from
tasmania
to
queensland
they
find
traces
of
the
rivers
and
fields
of
ice
which
mark
the
close
of
the
carboniferous
and
beginning
of
the
permian
on
the
southern
continent
in
south
africa
similar
indications
are
found
from
the
cape
to
the
transvaal
stranger
still
the
geologists
of
india
have
discovered
extensive
areas
of
glaciation
belonging
to
this
period
running
down
into
the
actual
tropics
and
the
strangest
feature
of
all
is
that
the
glaciers
of
india
and
australia
flowed
not
from
the
temperate
zones
toward
the
tropics
but
in
the
opposite
direction
two
great
zones
of
land
lay
north
and
south
of
the
equator
the
total
area
was
probably
greater
than
the
enormous
area
covered
with
ice
in
europe
and
america
during
the
familiar
of
the
latest
geological
period
thus
the
central
idea
of
this
chapter
the
destructive
inroad
of
a
colder
climate
upon
the
genial
carboniferous
world
is
an
accepted
fact
critical
geologists
may
suggest
that
the
temperature
of
the
has
been
exaggerated
and
the
temperature
of
the
permian
put
too
low
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
dispute
whatever
the
exact
change
of
temperature
was
in
degrees
of
the
thermometer
it
was
admittedly
sufficient
to
transform
the
face
of
the
earth
and
bring
a
mantle
of
ice
over
millions
of
square
miles
of
our
tropical
and
subtropical
regions
it
remains
for
us
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
this
transformation
it
at
once
occurs
to
us
that
these
facts
seem
to
confirm
the
prevalent
idea
that
the
stripped
the
air
of
its
until
the
earth
shivered
in
an
atmosphere
thinner
than
that
of
on
reflection
however
it
will
be
seen
that
if
this
were
all
that
happened
we
might
indeed
expect
to
find
enormous
extending
from
the
poles
which
we
do
not
find
but
not
glaciation
in
the
tropics
others
may
think
of
astronomical
theories
and
imagine
a
shrinking
or
clouding
of
the
sun
or
a
change
in
the
direction
of
the
earth
axis
but
these
astronomical
theories
are
now
little
favoured
either
by
astronomers
or
geologists
professor
lowell
bluntly
calls
them
astrocomic
theories
geologists
think
them
superfluous
there
is
another
set
of
facts
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
permian
cold
as
we
have
seen
several
times
there
are
periods
when
either
owing
to
the
shrinking
of
the
earth
or
the
overloading
of
the
or
a
combination
of
the
two
the
land
regains
its
lost
territory
and
emerges
from
the
ocean
mountain
chains
rise
new
continental
surfaces
are
exposed
to
the
sun
and
rain
one
of
the
greatest
of
these
upheavals
of
the
land
occurs
in
the
latter
half
of
the
carboniferous
and
the
permian
in
the
middle
of
the
carboniferous
when
europe
is
predominantly
a
flat
land
largely
submerged
a
chain
of
mountains
begins
to
rise
across
its
central
part
from
brittany
to
the
east
of
saxony
the
great
ridge
runs
and
by
the
end
of
the
carboniferous
it
becomes
a
chain
of
lofty
mountains
of
which
fragments
remain
in
the
vosges
black
forest
and
hartz
mountains
dragging
central
europe
high
above
the
water
and
throwing
the
sea
back
upon
russia
to
the
north
and
the
mediterranean
region
to
the
south
then
the
chain
of
the
ural
mountains
begins
to
rise
on
the
russian
frontier
by
the
beginning
of
the
permian
europe
was
higher
above
the
water
than
it
had
ever
yet
been
there
was
only
a
sea
in
russia
and
a
southern
sea
with
narrow
arms
trailing
to
the
northwest
the
continent
of
north
america
also
had
meantime
emerged
the
rise
of
the
appalachia
and
ouachita
mountains
completes
the
emergence
of
the
eastern
continent
and
throws
the
sea
to
the
west
the
asiatic
continent
also
is
greatly
enlarged
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
there
is
a
further
rise
culminating
in
the
permian
of
the
continent
gondwana
land
which
united
south
america
south
africa
the
antarctic
land
australia
and
new
zealand
with
an
arm
to
india
in
a
word
we
have
here
a
physical
revolution
in
the
face
of
the
earth
the
changes
were
generally
gradual
though
they
seem
in
some
places
to
have
been
rapid
and
abrupt
chamberlin
but
in
summary
they
amounted
to
a
vast
revolution
in
the
environment
of
animals
and
plants
the
swampy
continents
reared
themselves
upward
from
the
shook
the
marshes
and
lagoons
from
their
face
and
drained
the
vast
areas
that
had
fostered
the
growth
of
the
it
is
calculated
chamberlin
that
the
shallow
seas
which
had
covered
twenty
or
thirty
million
square
miles
of
our
continental
surfaces
in
the
early
carboniferous
were
reduced
to
about
five
million
square
miles
in
the
permian
geologists
believe
in
fact
that
the
area
of
exposed
land
was
probably
greater
than
it
is
now
this
lifting
and
draining
of
so
much
land
would
of
itself
have
a
profound
influence
on
and
then
we
must
take
account
of
its
indirect
influence
the
moisture
of
the
earlier
period
was
probably
due
in
the
main
to
the
large
proportion
of
and
the
absence
of
high
land
to
condense
it
in
both
respects
there
is
profound
alteration
and
the
atmosphere
must
have
become
very
much
drier
as
this
vapour
had
been
one
of
the
atmosphere
chief
elements
for
retaining
heat
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
change
will
involve
a
great
lowering
of
temperature
the
slanting
of
the
raised
land
would
aid
this
as
in
speeding
the
rivers
it
would
promote
the
circulation
of
water
another
effect
would
be
to
increase
the
circulation
of
the
atmosphere
the
higher
and
colder
lands
would
create
currents
of
air
that
had
not
been
formed
before
lastly
the
ocean
currents
would
be
profoundly
modified
but
the
effect
of
this
is
obscure
and
may
be
disregarded
for
the
moment
here
therefore
we
have
a
massive
series
of
causes
and
effects
all
connected
with
the
great
emergence
of
the
land
which
throw
a
broad
light
on
the
change
in
the
face
of
the
earth
we
must
add
the
lessening
of
the
carbon
dioxide
in
the
atmosphere
quite
apart
from
theories
of
the
early
atmosphere
this
process
must
have
had
a
great
influence
and
it
is
included
by
professor
chamberlin
among
the
causes
of
the
change
the
rocks
and
forests
of
the
carboniferous
period
are
calculated
to
have
absorbed
two
hundred
times
as
much
carbon
as
there
is
in
the
whole
of
our
atmosphere
where
the
carbon
came
from
we
may
leave
open
the
planetesimalists
look
for
its
origin
mainly
in
volcanic
eruptions
but
though
there
was
much
volcanic
activity
in
the
later
carboniferous
and
the
permian
there
is
little
trace
of
it
before
the
after
the
cambrian
however
that
may
be
there
was
a
considerable
lessening
of
the
of
the
atmosphere
and
this
in
turn
had
most
important
effects
first
the
removal
of
so
much
and
vapour
would
be
a
very
effective
reason
for
a
general
fall
in
the
temperature
of
the
earth
the
heat
received
from
the
sun
could
now
radiate
more
freely
into
space
secondly
it
has
been
shown
by
experiment
that
a
richness
in
favours
cryptogamous
plants
though
it
is
injurious
to
higher
plants
and
a
reduction
of
it
would
therefore
be
hurtful
to
the
cryptogams
of
the
one
may
almost
put
it
that
in
their
greed
they
exhausted
their
store
thirdly
it
meant
a
great
purification
of
the
atmosphere
and
thus
a
most
important
preparation
of
the
earth
for
higher
land
animals
and
plants
the
reader
will
begin
to
think
that
we
have
sufficiently
explained
the
permian
revolution
far
from
it
some
of
its
problems
are
as
yet
insoluble
we
have
given
no
explanation
at
all
why
the
which
we
would
in
a
general
way
be
prepared
to
expect
appear
in
india
and
australia
instead
of
farther
north
and
south
professor
chamberlin
in
a
profound
study
of
the
period
appendix
to
vol
ii
geology
suggests
that
the
new
land
from
new
zealand
to
antarctica
may
have
diverted
the
currents
sea
and
air
up
the
indian
ocean
and
caused
a
low
atmospheric
pressure
much
precipitation
of
moisture
and
perpetual
canopies
of
clouds
to
shield
the
ice
from
the
sun
since
the
outer
polar
regions
themselves
had
been
up
to
that
time
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
this
will
account
for
a
freezing
temperature
in
such
latitudes
as
australia
and
india
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
any
ice
at
the
poles
up
to
that
time
or
for
ages
afterwards
so
that
currents
from
the
polar
regions
would
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
today
if
on
the
other
hand
we
may
suppose
that
the
rise
of
gondwana
land
from
brazil
to
india
was
attended
by
the
formation
of
high
mountains
in
those
latitudes
we
have
the
basis
at
least
of
a
more
plausible
explanation
professor
chamberlin
rejects
this
supposition
on
the
ground
that
the
traces
of
are
at
or
near
the
since
we
find
with
them
beds
containing
marine
fossils
but
this
only
shows
at
the
most
that
the
terminations
of
the
glaciers
reached
the
sea
we
know
nothing
of
the
height
of
the
land
from
which
they
started
for
our
main
purpose
however
it
is
fortunately
not
necessary
to
clear
up
these
mysteries
it
is
enough
for
us
that
the
carboniferous
land
rises
high
above
the
surface
of
the
ocean
over
the
earth
generally
the
shallow
seas
are
drained
off
its
surface
its
swamps
and
lagoons
generally
disappear
its
waters
run
in
falling
rivers
to
the
ocean
the
dense
moist
warm
atmosphere
that
had
so
long
enveloped
it
is
changed
into
a
thinner
mantle
of
gas
through
which
night
by
night
the
ground
can
discharge
its
heat
into
space
cold
winds
blow
over
it
from
the
new
mountains
probably
vast
regions
of
it
are
swept
by
icy
blasts
from
the
glaciated
lands
as
these
conditions
advance
in
the
permian
period
the
forests
wither
and
shrink
of
the
extraordinarily
mixed
vegetation
which
we
found
in
the
some
few
types
are
fitted
to
meet
the
severe
conditions
the
trees
the
thin
trees
the
trees
with
stronger
texture
of
the
wood
are
slowly
singled
out
by
the
deepening
cold
the
golden
age
of
cryptogams
is
over
the
age
of
the
cycad
and
the
conifers
is
opening
survivors
of
the
old
order
linger
in
the
warmer
valleys
as
one
may
see
lingering
in
nooks
of
southern
regions
while
an
antarctic
wind
is
whistling
on
the
hills
above
them
but
over
the
broad
earth
the
luscious
pasturage
of
the
has
changed
into
what
is
comparatively
a
cold
desert
we
must
not
of
course
imagine
too
abrupt
a
change
the
earth
had
been
by
no
means
all
swamp
in
the
carboniferous
age
the
new
types
were
even
then
developing
in
the
cooler
and
drier
localities
but
their
hour
has
come
and
there
is
great
devastation
among
the
lower
plant
population
of
the
earth
it
follows
at
once
that
there
would
be
on
land
an
equal
devastation
and
a
similar
selection
in
the
animal
world
the
vegetarians
suffered
an
appalling
reduction
of
their
food
the
carnivores
would
dwindle
in
the
same
proportion
both
types
again
would
suffer
from
the
enormous
changes
in
their
physical
surroundings
vast
stretches
of
marsh
with
teeming
populations
were
drained
and
turned
into
firm
arid
plains
or
bleak
the
area
of
the
amphibia
for
instance
was
no
less
reduced
than
their
food
the
cold
in
turn
would
exercise
a
most
formidable
selection
before
the
permian
period
there
was
not
on
the
whole
earth
an
animal
with
a
heart
or
a
warm
coat
of
fur
or
feathers
nor
was
there
a
single
animal
that
gave
any
further
care
to
the
eggs
it
discharged
and
left
to
the
natural
warmth
of
the
earth
to
develop
the
extermination
of
species
in
the
egg
alone
must
have
been
enormous
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
just
impression
of
the
carnage
which
this
permian
revolution
wrought
among
the
population
of
the
earth
we
can
but
estimate
how
many
species
of
animals
and
plants
were
exterminated
and
the
reader
must
dimly
imagine
the
myriads
of
living
things
that
are
comprised
in
each
species
an
earlier
american
geologist
professor
le
conte
said
that
not
a
single
carboniferous
species
crossed
the
line
of
the
permian
revolution
this
has
proved
to
be
an
exaggeration
but
professor
chamberlin
seems
to
fall
into
an
exaggeration
on
the
other
side
when
he
says
that
out
of
species
survived
there
are
only
about
species
of
animals
and
plants
known
in
the
whole
of
the
permian
rocks
geikie
and
most
of
these
are
new
for
instance
of
the
enormous
of
the
comprising
many
thousands
of
species
only
fifty
species
survived
unchanged
in
the
permian
we
may
say
that
as
far
as
our
knowledge
goes
of
every
thirty
species
of
animals
and
plants
in
the
carboniferous
period
were
blotted
out
of
the
calendar
of
life
for
ever
one
survived
by
undergoing
such
modifications
that
it
became
a
new
species
and
one
was
found
fit
to
endure
the
new
conditions
for
a
time
we
must
leave
it
to
the
imagination
to
appreciate
the
total
devastation
of
individuals
entailed
in
this
appalling
application
of
what
we
call
natural
selection
but
what
higher
types
of
life
issued
from
the
womb
of
nature
after
so
long
and
painful
a
travail
the
annihilation
of
the
unfit
is
the
seamy
side
though
the
most
real
side
of
natural
selection
we
ignore
it
or
extenuate
it
and
turn
rather
to
consider
the
advances
in
organisation
by
which
the
survivors
were
enabled
to
outlive
the
great
chill
and
impoverishment
unfortunately
if
the
permian
period
is
an
age
of
death
it
is
not
an
age
of
burials
the
fossil
population
of
its
cemeteries
is
very
scanty
not
only
is
the
living
population
enormously
reduced
but
the
areas
that
were
accustomed
to
entomb
and
preserve
organisms
the
lake
and
shore
deposits
are
also
greatly
reduced
the
frames
of
animals
and
plants
now
rot
on
the
dry
ground
on
which
they
live
even
in
the
seas
where
life
must
have
been
much
reduced
by
the
general
disturbance
of
conditions
the
record
is
poor
molluscs
and
brachiopods
and
small
fishes
fill
the
list
but
are
of
little
instructiveness
for
us
except
that
they
show
a
general
advance
of
species
among
the
cephalopods
it
is
true
we
find
a
notable
arrival
on
the
one
hand
a
single
small
cephalopod
lingers
for
a
time
with
the
ancestral
form
on
the
other
hand
a
new
and
formidable
competitor
appears
among
the
cephalopods
it
is
the
first
appearance
of
the
famous
ammonite
but
we
may
defer
the
description
of
it
until
we
come
to
the
great
age
of
ammonites
of
the
insects
and
their
fortunes
in
the
great
famine
we
have
no
direct
knowledge
no
insect
remains
have
yet
been
found
in
permian
rocks
we
shall
however
find
them
much
advanced
in
the
next
period
and
must
conclude
that
the
selection
acted
very
effectively
among
their
thousand
carboniferous
species
the
most
interesting
outcome
of
the
new
conditions
is
the
rise
and
spread
of
the
reptiles
no
other
sign
of
the
times
indicates
so
clearly
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
as
the
appearance
of
these
primitive
clumsy
reptiles
which
now
begin
to
oust
the
amphibia
the
long
reign
of
aquatic
life
is
over
the
ensign
of
progress
passes
to
the
land
animals
the
amphibian
deserts
the
water
entirely
in
one
or
more
of
its
branches
and
a
new
and
fateful
dynasty
is
founded
although
many
of
the
reptiles
will
return
to
the
water
when
the
land
sinks
once
more
the
type
of
the
terrestrial
quadruped
is
now
fully
evolved
and
from
its
early
reptilian
form
will
emerge
the
lords
of
the
air
and
the
lords
of
the
land
the
birds
and
the
mammals
to
the
uninformed
it
may
seem
that
no
very
great
advance
is
made
when
the
reptile
is
evolved
from
the
amphibian
in
reality
the
change
implies
a
profound
modification
of
the
frame
and
life
of
the
vertebrate
partly
we
may
suppose
on
account
of
the
purification
of
the
air
partly
on
account
of
the
decrease
in
water
surface
the
gills
are
now
entirely
discarded
the
young
reptile
loses
them
during
its
embryonic
life
as
man
and
all
the
mammals
and
birds
do
and
issues
from
the
egg
a
purely
creature
a
richer
blood
now
courses
through
the
arteries
nourishing
the
brain
and
nerves
as
well
as
the
muscles
the
superfluous
tissue
of
the
is
used
in
the
improvement
of
the
ear
and
a
process
that
had
begun
in
the
amphibian
the
body
is
raised
up
higher
from
the
ground
on
firmer
limbs
the
ribs
and
the
shoulder
and
pelvic
bones
the
saddles
by
which
the
weight
of
the
body
is
adjusted
between
the
limbs
and
the
backbone
are
strengthened
and
improved
finally
two
important
organs
for
the
protection
and
nurture
of
the
embryo
the
amnion
and
the
allantois
make
their
appearance
for
the
first
time
in
the
reptile
in
grade
of
organisation
the
reptile
is
really
nearer
to
the
bird
than
it
is
to
the
salamander
yet
these
permian
reptiles
are
so
generalised
in
character
and
so
primitive
in
structure
that
they
point
back
unmistakably
to
an
amphibian
ancestry
the
actual
line
of
descent
is
obscure
when
the
reptiles
first
appear
in
the
rocks
they
are
already
divided
into
widely
different
groups
and
must
have
been
evolved
some
time
before
probably
they
started
from
some
group
or
groups
of
the
amphibia
in
the
later
carboniferous
when
as
we
saw
the
land
began
to
rise
considerably
we
have
not
yet
recovered
and
may
never
recover
the
region
where
the
early
forms
lived
and
therefore
can
not
trace
the
development
in
detail
the
fossil
archives
we
can
not
repeat
too
often
are
not
a
continuous
but
a
fragmentary
record
of
the
story
of
life
the
task
of
the
evolutionist
may
be
compared
to
the
work
of
tracing
the
footsteps
of
a
straying
animal
across
the
country
here
and
there
its
traces
will
be
amply
registered
on
patches
of
softer
ground
but
for
the
most
part
they
will
be
entirely
lost
on
the
firmer
ground
so
it
is
with
the
fossil
record
of
life
only
in
certain
special
conditions
are
the
passing
forms
buried
and
preserved
in
this
case
we
can
say
only
that
the
permian
reptiles
fall
into
two
great
groups
and
that
one
of
these
shows
affinities
to
the
small
amphibia
of
the
the
microsaurs
while
the
other
has
affinities
to
the
labyrinthodonts
a
closer
examination
of
these
early
reptiles
may
be
postponed
until
we
come
to
speak
of
the
age
of
reptiles
we
shall
see
that
it
is
probable
that
an
even
higher
type
of
animal
the
mammal
was
born
in
the
throes
of
the
permian
revolution
but
enough
has
been
said
in
vindication
of
the
phrase
which
stands
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
and
to
show
how
the
great
primary
age
of
terrestrial
life
came
to
a
close
with
its
new
inhabitants
the
earth
enters
upon
a
fresh
phase
and
thousands
of
its
earlier
animals
and
plants
are
sealed
in
their
primordial
tombs
to
await
the
day
when
man
will
break
the
seals
and
put
flesh
once
more
on
the
petrified
bones
chapter
xi
the
middle
ages
of
the
earth
the
story
of
the
earth
from
the
beginning
of
the
cambrian
period
to
the
present
day
was
long
ago
divided
by
geologists
into
four
great
eras
the
periods
we
have
already
covered
the
cambrian
ordovician
silurian
devonian
carboniferous
and
permian
form
the
primary
or
palaeozoic
era
to
which
the
earlier
archaean
rocks
were
prefixed
as
a
barren
and
less
interesting
introduction
the
stretch
of
time
on
which
we
now
enter
at
the
close
of
the
permian
is
the
secondary
or
mesozoic
era
it
will
be
closed
by
a
fresh
upheaval
of
the
earth
and
disturbance
of
in
the
chalk
period
and
followed
by
a
tertiary
era
in
which
the
earth
will
approach
its
modern
aspect
at
its
close
there
will
be
another
series
of
upheavals
culminating
in
a
great
and
the
remaining
stretch
of
the
earth
story
in
which
we
live
will
form
the
quaternary
era
in
point
of
duration
these
four
eras
differ
enormously
from
each
other
if
the
first
be
conceived
as
comprising
sixteen
million
years
a
very
moderate
estimate
the
second
will
be
found
to
cover
less
than
eight
million
years
the
third
less
than
three
million
years
and
the
fourth
the
age
of
man
much
less
than
one
million
years
while
the
archaean
age
was
probably
as
long
as
all
these
put
together
but
the
division
is
rather
based
on
certain
gaps
or
unconformities
in
the
geological
record
and
although
the
breaches
are
now
partially
filled
we
saw
that
they
correspond
to
certain
profound
and
revolutionary
disturbances
in
the
face
of
the
earth
we
retain
them
therefore
as
convenient
and
logical
divisions
of
the
biological
as
well
as
the
geological
chronicle
and
instead
of
passing
from
one
geological
period
to
another
we
may
for
the
rest
of
the
story
take
these
three
eras
as
wholes
and
devote
a
few
chapters
to
the
chief
advances
made
by
living
things
in
each
era
the
mesozoic
era
will
be
a
protracted
reaction
between
two
revolutions
a
period
of
land
great
and
genial
climate
between
two
upheavals
of
the
earth
the
tertiary
era
will
represent
a
less
sharply
defined
depression
with
genial
climate
and
luxuriant
life
between
two
such
upheavals
the
mesozaic
middle
life
era
may
very
fitly
be
described
as
the
middle
ages
of
life
on
the
earth
it
by
no
means
occupies
a
central
position
in
the
chronicle
of
life
from
the
point
of
view
of
time
or
antiquity
just
as
the
middle
ages
of
europe
are
by
no
means
the
centre
of
the
chronicle
of
mankind
but
its
types
of
animals
and
plants
are
singularly
transitional
between
the
extinct
ancient
and
the
actual
modern
types
life
has
been
lifted
to
a
higher
level
by
the
permian
revolution
then
for
some
millions
of
years
the
sterner
process
of
selection
relaxes
the
warm
bosom
of
the
earth
swarms
again
with
a
teeming
and
varied
population
and
a
rich
material
is
provided
for
the
next
great
application
of
drastic
selective
agencies
to
a
poet
it
might
seem
that
nature
indulges
each
succeeding
and
imperfect
type
of
living
thing
with
a
golden
age
before
it
is
dismissed
to
make
place
for
the
higher
the
mesozoic
opens
in
the
middle
of
the
great
revolution
described
in
the
last
chapter
its
first
section
the
triassic
period
is
at
first
a
mere
continuation
of
the
permian
a
few
hundred
species
of
animals
and
hardy
plants
are
scattered
over
a
relatively
bleak
and
inhospitable
globe
then
the
land
begins
to
sink
once
more
the
seas
spread
in
great
arms
over
the
revelled
continents
the
plant
world
rejoices
in
the
increasing
warmth
and
moisture
and
the
animals
increase
in
number
and
variety
we
pass
into
the
jurassic
period
under
conditions
of
great
geniality
warm
seas
are
found
as
far
north
and
south
as
our
present
polar
regions
and
the
fertile
lands
are
covered
again
with
rich
if
less
gigantic
forests
in
which
hordes
of
stupendous
animals
find
ample
nourishment
the
mammal
and
the
bird
are
already
on
the
stage
but
their
warm
coats
and
warm
blood
offer
no
advantage
in
that
perennial
summer
and
they
await
in
obscurity
the
end
of
the
golden
age
of
the
reptiles
at
the
end
of
the
jurassic
the
land
begins
to
rise
once
more
the
warm
shallow
seas
drain
off
into
the
deep
oceans
and
the
moist
swampy
lands
are
dried
the
emergence
continues
throughout
the
cretaceous
chalk
period
chains
of
vast
mountains
rise
slowly
into
the
air
in
many
parts
of
the
earth
and
a
new
and
comparatively
rapid
change
in
the
vegetation
comparable
to
that
at
the
close
of
the
carboniferous
announces
the
second
great
revolution
the
mesozoic
closes
with
the
dismissal
of
the
great
reptiles
and
the
plants
on
which
they
fed
and
the
earth
is
prepared
for
its
new
monarchs
the
flowering
plants
the
birds
and
the
mammals
how
far
this
repeated
levelling
of
the
land
after
its
repeated
upheavals
is
due
to
a
real
sinking
of
the
crust
we
can
not
as
yet
determine
the
geologist
of
our
time
is
disposed
to
restrict
these
mysterious
rises
and
falls
of
the
crust
as
much
as
possible
a
much
more
obvious
and
intelligible
agency
has
to
be
considered
the
vast
upheaval
of
nearly
all
parts
of
the
land
during
the
permian
period
would
naturally
lead
to
a
far
more
vigorous
scouring
of
its
surface
by
the
rains
and
rivers
the
higher
the
land
the
more
effectively
it
would
be
worn
down
the
cooler
summits
would
condense
the
moisture
and
the
rains
would
sweep
more
energetically
down
the
slopes
of
the
elevated
continents
there
would
thus
be
a
natural
process
of
levelling
as
long
as
the
land
stood
out
high
above
the
but
it
seems
probable
that
there
was
also
a
real
sinking
of
the
crust
such
subsidences
have
been
known
within
historic
times
by
the
end
of
the
triassic
a
period
of
at
least
two
million
years
the
sea
had
reconquered
a
vast
proportion
of
the
territory
wrested
from
it
in
the
permian
revolution
most
of
europe
west
of
a
line
drawn
from
the
tip
of
norway
to
the
black
sea
was
under
water
generally
open
sea
in
the
south
and
centre
and
inland
seas
or
lagoons
in
the
west
the
invasion
of
the
sea
continued
and
reached
its
climax
in
the
jurassic
period
the
greater
part
of
europe
was
converted
into
an
archipelago
a
small
continent
stood
out
in
the
baltic
region
large
areas
remained
above
the
in
austria
germany
and
france
ireland
wales
and
much
of
scotland
were
intact
and
it
is
probable
that
a
land
bridge
still
connected
the
west
of
europe
with
the
east
of
america
europe
generally
was
a
large
cluster
of
islands
and
ridges
of
various
sizes
in
a
sea
southern
asia
was
similarly
revelled
and
it
is
probable
that
the
seas
stretched
with
little
interruption
from
the
west
of
europe
to
the
pacific
the
southern
continent
had
deep
wedges
of
the
sea
driven
into
it
india
new
zealand
and
australia
were
successively
detached
from
it
and
by
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
it
was
much
as
we
find
it
the
arctic
continent
north
of
europe
was
flooded
and
there
was
a
great
interior
sea
in
the
western
part
of
the
north
american
continent
this
summary
account
of
the
levelling
process
which
went
on
during
the
triassic
and
jurassic
will
prepare
us
to
expect
a
return
of
warm
climate
and
luxurious
life
and
this
the
record
abundantly
evinces
the
enormous
expansion
of
the
sea
a
great
authority
neumayr
believes
that
it
was
the
greatest
extension
of
the
sea
that
is
known
in
geology
and
lowering
of
the
land
would
of
itself
tend
to
produce
this
condition
and
it
may
be
that
the
very
considerable
volcanic
activity
of
which
we
find
evidence
in
the
permian
and
triassic
had
discharged
great
volumes
of
into
the
atmosphere
whatever
the
causes
were
the
earth
has
returned
to
paradisiacal
conditions
the
vast
have
gone
the
scanty
and
scrubby
vegetation
is
replaced
by
luscious
forests
of
cycads
conifers
and
ferns
and
animals
penetrate
to
what
are
now
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
greenland
and
spitzbergen
are
fragments
of
a
continent
that
then
bore
a
luxuriant
growth
of
ferns
and
cycads
and
housed
large
reptiles
that
could
not
now
live
thousands
of
miles
south
of
it
england
and
a
large
part
of
europe
was
a
tranquil
blue
the
fringes
of
its
islands
girt
with
reefs
such
as
we
find
now
only
three
thousand
miles
further
south
with
vast
shoals
of
ammonites
sometimes
of
gigantic
size
preying
upon
its
living
population
or
evading
its
monstrous
sharks
while
the
sunlit
lands
were
covered
with
graceful
palmlike
cycads
and
early
yews
and
pines
and
cypresses
and
quaint
forms
of
reptiles
throve
on
the
warm
earth
or
in
the
ample
swamps
or
rushed
on
outstretched
wings
through
the
purer
air
it
was
an
evergreen
world
a
world
apparently
of
perpetual
summer
no
trace
is
found
until
the
next
period
of
an
alternation
of
summer
and
winter
no
trees
that
shed
their
leaves
annually
or
show
annual
rings
of
growth
in
the
wood
and
there
is
little
trace
of
zones
of
climate
as
yet
it
is
true
that
the
sensitive
ammonites
differ
in
the
northern
and
the
southern
latitudes
but
as
professor
chamberlin
says
it
is
not
clear
that
the
difference
points
to
a
diversity
of
climate
we
may
conclude
that
the
absence
of
corals
higher
than
the
north
of
england
implies
a
more
temperate
climate
further
north
but
what
sir
geikie
calls
with
slight
exaggeration
the
almost
tropical
aspect
of
greenland
warns
us
to
be
cautious
the
climate
of
the
was
very
much
warmer
and
more
uniform
than
the
climate
of
the
earth
it
was
an
age
of
great
vital
expansion
and
into
this
luxuriant
world
we
shall
presently
find
a
fresh
period
of
elevation
disturbance
and
cold
breaking
with
momentous
evolutionary
results
meantime
we
may
take
a
closer
look
at
these
interesting
inhabitants
of
the
middle
ages
of
the
earth
before
they
pass
away
or
are
driven
in
shrunken
regiments
into
the
shelter
of
the
narrowing
tropics
the
principal
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
earth
as
the
cold
arid
plains
and
slopes
of
the
triassic
slowly
yield
the
moist
and
warm
lands
of
the
jurassic
to
consists
in
the
character
of
the
vegetation
it
is
wholly
intermediate
in
its
forms
between
that
of
the
primitive
forests
and
that
of
the
modern
world
the
great
cryptogams
of
the
carboniferous
world
the
giant
and
their
kindred
have
been
slain
by
the
long
period
of
cold
and
drought
smaller
horsetails
sometimes
of
a
great
size
but
generally
of
the
modern
type
and
remain
but
are
not
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
landscape
on
the
other
hand
there
is
as
yet
apart
from
the
conifers
no
trace
of
the
familiar
trees
and
flowers
and
grasses
of
the
later
world
the
vast
majority
of
the
plants
are
of
the
cycad
type
these
now
confined
to
tropical
and
subtropical
regions
with
the
surviving
ferns
the
new
conifers
and
certain
trees
of
the
ginkgo
type
form
the
characteristic
mesozoic
vegetation
a
few
words
in
the
language
of
the
modern
botanist
will
show
how
this
vegetation
harmonises
with
the
story
of
evolution
plants
are
broadly
divided
into
the
lower
kingdom
of
the
cryptogams
and
the
upper
kingdom
of
the
phanerogams
as
we
saw
the
primary
era
was
predominantly
the
age
of
cryptogams
the
later
periods
witness
the
rise
and
supremacy
of
the
phanerogams
but
these
in
turn
are
broadly
divided
into
a
less
advanced
group
the
gymnosperms
and
a
more
advanced
group
the
angiosperms
or
flowering
plants
and
just
as
the
primary
era
is
the
age
of
cryptogams
the
secondary
is
the
age
of
gymnosperms
and
the
tertiary
and
present
is
the
age
of
angiosperms
of
about
species
of
plants
in
nature
more
than
are
angiosperms
yet
up
to
the
end
of
the
jurassic
not
a
single
true
angiosperm
is
found
in
the
geological
record
this
is
a
broad
manifestation
of
evolution
but
it
is
not
quite
an
accurate
statement
and
its
inexactness
still
more
strongly
confirms
the
theory
of
evolution
though
the
primary
era
was
predominantly
the
age
of
cryptogams
we
saw
that
a
very
large
number
of
plants
with
very
mixed
characters
appeared
before
its
close
it
thus
prepares
the
way
for
the
cycads
and
conifers
and
ginkgoes
of
the
mesozoic
which
we
may
conceive
as
evolved
from
one
or
other
branch
of
the
mixed
carboniferous
vegetation
we
next
find
that
the
mesozoic
is
by
no
means
purely
an
age
of
gymnosperms
i
do
not
mean
merely
that
the
angiosperms
appear
in
force
before
its
close
and
were
probably
evolved
much
earlier
the
fact
is
that
the
gymnosperms
of
the
mesozoic
are
often
of
a
curiously
mixed
character
and
well
illustrate
the
transition
to
the
angiosperms
though
they
may
not
be
their
actual
ancestors
this
will
be
clearer
if
we
glance
in
succession
at
the
various
types
of
plant
which
adorned
and
enriched
the
jurassic
world
the
european
or
american
landscape
indeed
the
aspect
of
the
earth
generally
for
there
are
no
pronounced
zones
of
climate
is
still
utterly
different
from
any
that
we
know
no
grass
carpets
the
plains
none
of
the
flowers
or
trees
with
which
we
are
familiar
except
conifers
are
found
in
any
region
ferns
grow
in
great
abundance
and
have
now
reached
many
of
the
forms
with
which
we
are
acquainted
thickets
of
bracken
spread
over
the
plains
clumps
of
royal
ferns
and
hartstongues
spring
up
in
moister
parts
the
trees
are
conifers
cycads
and
trees
akin
to
the
ginkgo
or
maidenhair
tree
of
modern
japan
cypresses
yews
firs
and
araucarias
the
monkey
puzzle
group
grow
everywhere
though
the
species
are
more
primitive
than
those
of
today
the
broad
leaves
and
fruit
of
the
ginkgoales
of
which
the
of
japan
have
religiously
preserved
a
solitary
descendant
are
found
in
the
most
distant
regions
but
the
most
frequent
and
characteristic
tree
of
the
jurassic
landscape
is
the
cycad
the
cycads
the
botanist
would
say
cycadophyta
or
cycadales
to
mark
them
off
from
the
cycads
of
modern
times
formed
a
third
of
the
whole
jurassic
vegetation
while
they
number
only
about
a
hundred
species
in
and
are
confined
to
warm
latitudes
all
over
the
earth
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
their
foliage
showered
from
the
top
of
their
generally
short
stems
in
the
jurassic
but
the
most
interesting
point
about
them
is
that
a
very
large
branch
of
them
the
bennettiteae
went
far
beyond
the
modern
gymnosperm
in
their
flowers
and
fruit
and
approached
the
angiosperms
their
fructifications
rivalled
the
largest
flowers
of
the
present
day
in
structure
and
modelling
scott
and
possibly
already
gave
spots
of
sober
colour
to
the
monotonous
primitive
landscape
on
the
other
hand
they
approached
the
ferns
so
much
more
closely
than
modern
cycads
do
that
it
is
often
impossible
to
say
whether
jurassic
remains
must
be
classed
as
ferns
or
cycads
we
have
here
therefore
a
most
interesting
evolutionary
group
the
botanist
finds
even
more
difficulty
than
the
zoologist
in
drawing
up
the
pedigrees
of
his
plants
but
the
general
features
of
the
larger
groups
which
he
finds
in
succession
in
the
chronicle
of
the
earth
point
very
decisively
to
evolution
the
ferns
of
the
point
upward
to
the
later
stage
and
downward
to
a
common
origin
with
the
ordinary
ferns
some
of
them
are
altogether
of
a
cycadean
type
scott
in
respect
of
the
seed
on
the
other
hand
the
bennettiteae
of
the
jurassic
have
the
mixed
characters
of
ferns
cycads
and
flowering
plants
and
thus
in
their
turn
point
downward
to
a
lower
ancestry
and
upward
to
the
next
great
stage
in
it
is
not
suggested
that
the
we
know
evolved
into
the
cycads
we
know
and
these
in
turn
into
our
flowering
plants
it
is
enough
for
the
student
of
evolution
to
see
in
them
so
many
stages
in
the
evolution
of
plants
up
to
the
angiosperm
level
the
gaps
between
the
various
groups
are
less
rigid
than
scientific
men
used
to
think
taller
than
the
cycads
firmer
in
the
structure
of
the
wood
and
destined
to
survive
in
thousands
of
species
when
the
cycads
would
be
reduced
to
a
hundred
were
the
pines
and
yews
and
other
conifers
of
the
jurassic
landscape
we
saw
them
first
appearing
in
the
stunted
walchias
and
voltzias
during
the
severe
conditions
of
the
permian
period
like
the
birds
and
mammals
they
await
the
coming
of
a
fresh
period
of
cold
to
give
them
a
decided
superiority
over
the
cycads
botanists
look
for
their
ancestors
in
some
form
related
to
the
cordaites
of
the
the
ginkgo
trees
seem
to
be
even
more
closely
related
to
the
cordaites
and
evolved
from
an
early
and
generalised
branch
of
that
group
the
cordaites
we
may
recall
more
or
less
united
in
one
tree
the
characters
of
the
conifer
in
their
wood
and
the
cycad
in
their
fruit
so
much
for
the
evolutionary
aspect
of
the
jurassic
vegetation
in
itself
slender
as
the
connecting
links
are
it
points
clearly
enough
to
a
selection
of
higher
types
during
the
permian
revolution
from
the
varied
mass
of
the
carboniferous
flora
and
it
offers
in
turn
a
singularly
varied
and
rich
group
from
which
a
fresh
selection
may
choose
yet
higher
types
we
turn
now
to
consider
the
animal
population
which
directly
or
indirectly
fed
upon
it
and
grew
with
its
growth
to
the
reptiles
the
birds
and
the
mammals
we
must
devote
special
chapters
here
we
may
briefly
survey
the
less
conspicuous
animals
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
the
insects
would
be
one
of
the
chief
classes
to
benefit
by
the
renewed
luxuriance
of
the
vegetation
the
hymenopters
butterflies
have
not
yet
appeared
they
will
naturally
come
with
the
flowers
in
the
next
great
phase
of
organic
life
but
all
the
other
orders
of
insects
are
represented
and
many
of
our
modern
genera
are
fully
evolved
the
giant
insects
of
the
with
their
mixed
patriarchal
features
have
given
place
to
more
definite
types
swarms
of
termites
with
wings
crickets
and
cockroaches
may
be
gathered
from
the
preserved
remains
the
beetles
coleopters
have
come
on
the
scene
in
the
triassic
and
prospered
exceedingly
in
some
strata
of
the
insects
are
beetles
and
as
we
find
that
many
of
them
are
we
are
not
surprised
flies
dipters
and
ants
hymenopters
also
are
found
and
although
it
is
useless
to
expect
to
find
the
intermediate
forms
of
such
frail
creatures
the
record
is
of
some
evolutionary
interest
the
ants
are
all
winged
apparently
there
is
as
yet
none
of
the
remarkable
division
of
labour
which
we
find
in
the
ants
and
we
may
trust
that
some
later
period
of
change
may
throw
light
on
its
origin
just
as
the
growth
of
the
forests
for
the
mesozoic
vegetation
has
formed
immense
in
many
parts
of
the
world
even
in
yorkshire
and
scotland
explains
this
great
development
of
the
insects
they
would
in
their
turn
supply
a
rich
diet
to
the
smaller
land
animals
and
flying
animals
of
the
time
we
shall
see
this
presently
let
us
first
glance
at
the
advances
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
seas
the
most
important
and
stimulating
event
in
the
seas
is
the
arrival
of
the
ammonite
one
branch
of
the
early
it
will
be
remembered
retained
the
head
of
its
naked
ancestor
and
lived
at
the
open
mouth
of
its
shell
thus
giving
birth
to
the
cephalopods
the
first
form
was
a
long
straight
tapering
shell
sometimes
several
feet
long
in
the
course
of
time
new
forms
with
curved
shells
appeared
and
began
to
displace
the
then
cephalopods
with
shells
like
the
nautilus
came
and
such
a
shell
being
an
obvious
advantage
displaced
the
curved
shells
in
the
permian
we
saw
a
new
and
more
advanced
type
of
the
animal
the
ammonite
made
its
appearance
and
in
the
triassic
and
jurassic
it
becomes
the
ogre
or
tyrant
of
the
invertebrate
world
sometimes
an
inch
or
less
in
diameter
it
often
attained
a
width
of
three
feet
or
more
across
the
shell
at
the
aperture
of
which
would
be
a
monstrous
and
voracious
mouth
the
ammonites
are
not
merely
interesting
as
extinct
monsters
of
the
earth
middle
ages
and
stimulating
terrors
of
the
deep
to
the
animals
on
which
they
fed
they
have
an
especial
interest
for
the
evolutionist
the
successive
chambers
which
the
animal
adds
as
it
grows
to
the
habitation
of
its
youth
leave
the
earlier
chambers
intact
by
removing
them
in
succession
in
the
adult
form
we
find
an
illustration
of
the
evolution
of
the
elaborate
shell
of
the
jurassic
ammonite
it
is
an
admirable
testimony
to
the
validity
of
the
embryonic
law
we
have
often
quoted
that
the
young
animal
is
apt
to
reproduce
the
past
stages
of
its
ancestry
that
the
order
of
the
building
of
the
shell
in
the
late
ammonite
corresponds
to
the
order
we
trace
in
its
development
in
the
geological
chronicle
about
a
thousand
species
of
ammonites
were
developed
in
the
mesozoic
and
none
survived
the
mesozoic
like
the
trilobites
of
the
primary
era
like
the
contemporary
great
reptiles
on
land
the
ammonites
were
an
abortive
growth
enjoying
their
hour
of
supremacy
until
sterner
conditions
bade
them
depart
the
pretty
nautilus
is
the
only
survivor
of
the
vast
mesozoic
population
of
cephalopods
a
rival
to
the
ammonite
appeared
in
the
triassic
seas
a
formidable
forerunner
of
the
type
of
cephalopod
the
animal
now
boldly
discards
the
protecting
and
confining
shell
or
spreads
over
the
outside
of
it
and
becomes
a
with
the
shell
inside
the
octopus
of
our
own
time
has
advanced
still
further
and
become
the
most
powerful
of
the
invertebrates
the
belemnite
as
the
mesozoic
is
called
attained
so
large
a
size
that
the
internal
bone
or
pen
the
part
generally
preserved
is
sometimes
two
feet
in
length
the
of
the
belemnite
also
are
sometimes
preserved
and
we
see
how
it
could
balk
a
pursuer
by
darkening
the
waters
it
was
a
compensating
advantage
for
the
loss
of
the
shell
in
all
the
other
classes
of
aquatic
animals
we
find
corresponding
advances
in
the
remaining
molluscs
the
higher
or
more
effective
types
are
displacing
the
older
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
oyster
is
fully
developed
and
has
a
very
large
kindred
in
the
mesozoic
seas
among
the
brachiopods
the
higher
type
displaces
the
shells
in
the
crustacea
the
trilobites
and
eurypterids
have
entirely
disappeared
prawns
and
lobsters
abound
and
the
earliest
crab
makes
its
appearance
in
the
english
jurassic
rocks
this
sudden
arrival
of
a
crustacean
surprises
us
less
when
we
learn
that
the
crab
has
a
long
tail
in
its
embryonic
form
but
the
actual
line
of
its
descent
is
not
clear
among
the
echinoderms
we
find
that
the
cystids
and
blastoids
have
gone
and
the
reach
their
climax
in
beauty
and
organisation
to
dwindle
and
almost
disappear
in
the
last
part
of
the
mesozoic
one
jurassic
was
found
to
have
distinct
ossicles
in
its
petrified
frame
the
echinoderms
are
now
in
the
ascendant
the
being
especially
abundant
the
corals
are
as
we
saw
extremely
abundant
and
a
higher
type
the
hexacoralla
is
superseding
the
earlier
and
lower
tetracoralla
finally
we
find
a
continuous
and
conspicuous
advance
among
the
fishes
at
the
close
of
the
triassic
and
during
the
jurassic
they
seem
to
undergo
profound
and
comparatively
rapid
changes
the
reason
will
perhaps
be
apparent
in
the
next
chapter
when
we
describe
the
gigantic
reptiles
which
feed
on
them
in
the
lakes
and
a
greater
terror
than
the
shark
had
appeared
in
their
environment
the
ganoids
and
dipneusts
dwindle
and
give
birth
to
their
few
modern
representatives
the
sharks
with
crushing
teeth
diminish
in
number
and
the
modern
shark
attains
the
supremacy
in
its
class
and
evolves
into
forms
far
more
terrible
than
any
that
we
know
skates
and
rays
of
a
more
or
less
modern
type
and
ancestral
and
sturgeons
enter
the
arena
but
the
most
interesting
new
departure
is
the
first
appearance
in
the
jurassic
of
fishes
teleosts
their
superiority
in
organisation
soon
makes
itself
felt
and
they
enter
upon
the
rapid
evolution
which
will
by
the
next
period
give
them
the
first
place
in
the
fish
world
over
the
whole
mesozoic
world
therefore
we
find
advance
and
the
promise
of
greater
advance
the
permian
stress
has
selected
the
fittest
types
to
survive
from
the
older
order
the
jurassic
luxuriance
is
permitting
a
fresh
and
varied
expansion
of
life
in
preparation
for
the
next
great
annihilation
of
the
less
fit
and
selection
of
the
more
fit
life
pauses
before
another
leap
the
mesozoic
earth
to
apply
to
it
the
phrase
which
a
geologist
has
given
to
its
opening
phase
welcomes
the
coming
and
speeds
the
parting
guest
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
a
new
movement
is
preparing
but
we
have
yet
to
study
the
highest
forms
of
mesozoic
life
before
we
come
to
the
cretaceous
disturbances
chapter
xii
the
age
of
reptiles
from
one
point
of
view
the
advance
of
life
on
the
earth
seems
to
proceed
not
with
the
even
flow
of
a
river
but
in
the
successive
waves
of
an
oncoming
tide
it
is
true
that
we
have
detected
a
continuous
advance
behind
all
these
rising
and
receding
waves
yet
their
occurrence
is
a
fact
of
some
interest
and
not
a
little
speculation
has
been
expended
on
it
when
the
great
procession
of
life
first
emerges
out
of
the
darkness
of
archaean
times
it
deploys
into
a
spreading
world
of
strange
crustaceans
and
we
have
the
age
of
trilobites
later
there
is
the
age
of
fishes
then
of
cryptogams
and
amphibia
and
then
of
cycads
and
reptiles
and
there
will
afterwards
be
an
age
of
birds
and
mammals
and
finally
an
age
of
man
but
there
is
no
ground
for
mystic
speculation
on
this
circumstance
of
a
group
of
organisms
fording
the
earth
for
a
few
million
years
and
then
perishing
or
dwindling
into
insignificance
we
shall
see
that
a
very
plain
and
substantial
process
put
an
end
to
the
age
of
the
cycads
ammonites
and
reptiles
and
we
have
seen
how
the
earlier
dynasties
ended
the
phrase
however
the
age
of
reptiles
is
a
fitting
and
true
description
of
the
greater
part
of
the
mesozoic
era
which
lies
like
a
fertile
valley
between
the
permian
and
the
chalk
upheavals
from
the
bleak
heights
of
the
permian
period
or
more
probably
from
its
more
sheltered
regions
in
which
they
have
lingered
with
the
ferns
and
cycads
the
reptiles
spread
out
over
the
earth
as
the
summer
of
the
triassic
period
advances
in
the
full
warmth
and
luxuriance
of
the
jurassic
they
become
the
most
singular
and
powerful
army
that
ever
trod
the
earth
they
include
small
creatures
and
monsters
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
length
they
swim
like
whales
in
the
shallow
seas
they
shrink
into
the
shell
of
the
giant
turtle
they
rear
themselves
on
towering
hind
limbs
like
colossal
kangaroos
they
even
rise
into
the
air
and
fill
it
with
the
dragons
of
the
fairy
tale
they
spread
over
the
whole
earth
from
australia
to
the
arctic
circle
then
the
earth
seems
to
grow
impatient
of
their
dominance
and
they
shrink
towards
the
south
and
struggle
in
a
diminished
territory
the
colossal
monsters
and
the
formidable
dragons
go
the
way
of
all
primitive
life
and
a
ragged
regiment
of
crocodiles
turtles
and
serpents
in
the
tropics
with
a
swarm
of
smaller
creatures
in
the
fringes
of
the
warm
zone
is
all
that
remains
by
the
tertiary
era
of
the
army
of
the
mesozoic
reptiles
they
had
appeared
as
we
said
in
the
permian
period
probably
they
had
been
developed
during
the
later
carboniferous
since
we
find
them
already
branched
into
three
orders
with
many
in
the
permian
the
stimulating
and
selecting
disturbances
which
culminated
in
the
permian
revolution
had
begun
in
the
carboniferous
their
origin
is
not
clear
as
the
intermediate
forms
between
them
and
the
amphibia
are
not
found
this
is
not
surprising
if
we
may
suppose
that
some
of
the
amphibia
had
in
the
growing
struggle
pushed
inland
or
that
as
the
land
rose
and
the
waters
were
drained
in
certain
regions
they
had
gradually
adopted
a
purely
terrestrial
life
as
some
of
the
frogs
have
since
done
in
the
absence
of
water
their
frames
would
not
be
preserved
and
fossilised
we
can
therefore
understand
the
gap
in
the
record
between
the
amphibia
and
the
reptiles
from
their
structure
we
gather
that
they
sprang
from
at
least
two
different
branches
of
the
amphibia
their
remains
fall
into
two
great
groups
which
are
known
as
the
diapsid
and
the
synapsid
reptiles
the
former
seem
to
be
more
closely
related
to
the
microsauria
or
small
amphibia
of
the
the
latter
are
nearer
to
the
labyrinthodonts
it
is
not
suggested
that
these
were
their
actual
ancestors
but
that
they
came
from
the
same
early
amphibian
root
we
find
both
these
groups
in
patriarchal
forms
in
europe
north
america
and
south
africa
during
the
permian
period
they
are
usually
moderate
in
size
but
in
places
they
seem
to
have
found
good
conditions
and
prospered
a
few
years
ago
a
permian
bed
in
russia
yielded
a
most
interesting
series
of
remains
of
synapsid
reptiles
some
of
them
were
large
vegetarian
animals
more
than
twelve
feet
in
length
others
were
carnivores
with
very
powerful
heads
and
teeth
as
formidable
as
those
of
the
tiger
another
branch
of
the
same
order
lived
on
the
southern
continent
gondwana
land
and
has
left
numerous
remains
in
south
africa
we
shall
see
that
they
are
connected
by
many
authorities
with
the
origin
of
the
mammals
the
other
branch
the
diapsids
are
represented
by
the
curiously
primitive
lizard
of
new
zealand
the
tuatara
sphenodon
or
hatteria
of
which
i
have
seen
specimens
nearly
two
feet
in
length
that
one
did
not
care
to
approach
too
closely
the
diapsids
are
chiefly
interesting
however
as
the
reputed
ancestors
of
the
colossal
reptiles
of
the
jurassic
age
and
the
birds
these
synapsid
reptiles
are
more
commonly
known
as
pareiasauria
or
theromorpha
the
purified
air
of
the
permian
world
favoured
the
reptiles
being
but
the
cold
would
check
their
expansion
for
a
time
the
reptile
it
is
important
to
remember
usually
leaves
its
eggs
to
be
hatched
by
the
natural
warmth
of
the
ground
but
as
the
cold
of
the
permian
yielded
to
a
genial
climate
and
rich
vegetation
in
the
course
of
the
triassic
the
reptiles
entered
upon
their
memorable
development
the
amphibia
were
now
definitely
ousted
from
their
position
of
dominance
the
increase
of
the
waters
had
at
first
favoured
them
and
we
find
more
than
twenty
genera
and
some
very
large
individuals
of
the
amphibia
in
the
triassic
one
of
them
the
mastodonsaurus
had
a
head
three
feet
long
and
two
feet
wide
but
the
spread
of
the
reptiles
checked
them
and
they
shrank
rapidly
into
the
poor
and
defenceless
tribe
which
we
find
them
in
nature
to
follow
the
prolific
expansion
of
the
reptiles
in
the
conditions
of
the
jurassic
age
is
a
task
that
even
the
highest
authorities
approach
with
great
diffidence
science
is
not
yet
wholly
agreed
in
the
classification
of
the
vast
numbers
of
remains
which
the
mesozoic
rocks
have
yielded
and
the
affinities
of
the
various
groups
are
very
uncertain
we
can
not
be
content
however
merely
to
throw
on
the
screen
as
it
were
a
few
of
the
more
quaint
and
monstrous
types
out
of
the
teeming
mesozoic
population
and
describe
their
proportions
and
peculiarities
they
fall
into
natural
and
intelligible
groups
or
orders
and
their
features
are
closely
related
to
the
differing
regions
of
the
jurassic
world
while
therefore
we
must
abstain
from
drawing
up
settled
genealogical
trees
we
may
as
we
review
in
succession
the
monsters
of
the
land
the
waters
and
the
air
glance
at
the
most
recent
and
substantial
conjectures
of
scientific
men
as
to
their
origin
and
connections
the
deinosaurs
or
terrible
reptiles
the
monarchs
of
the
land
and
the
swamps
are
the
central
and
outstanding
family
of
the
mesozoic
reptiles
as
the
name
implies
this
group
includes
most
of
the
colossal
animals
such
as
the
diplodocus
which
the
illustrated
magazine
has
made
familiar
to
most
people
fortunately
the
assiduous
research
of
american
geologists
and
their
great
skill
and
patience
in
restoring
the
dead
forms
enable
us
to
form
a
very
fair
picture
of
this
family
of
medieval
giants
and
its
remarkable
ramifications
see
besides
the
usual
authorities
a
valuable
paper
by
lull
dinosaurian
distribution
the
diapsid
reptiles
of
the
permian
had
evolved
a
group
with
horny
beaks
the
rhyncocephalia
or
reptiles
of
which
the
tuatara
of
new
zealand
is
a
lingering
representative
new
zealand
seems
to
have
been
cut
off
from
the
southern
continent
at
the
close
of
the
permian
or
beginning
of
the
triassic
and
so
preserved
for
us
that
very
interesting
relic
of
permian
life
from
some
primitive
level
of
this
group
it
is
generally
believed
the
great
deinosaurs
arose
two
different
orders
seem
to
have
arisen
independently
or
diverged
rapidly
from
each
other
in
different
parts
of
the
world
one
group
seems
to
have
evolved
on
the
lost
atlantis
the
land
between
western
europe
and
america
whence
they
spread
westward
to
america
eastward
over
europe
and
southward
to
the
continent
which
still
united
africa
and
australia
we
find
their
remains
in
all
these
regions
another
stock
is
believed
to
have
arisen
in
america
both
these
groups
seem
to
have
been
more
or
less
biped
rearing
themselves
on
large
and
powerful
hind
limbs
and
in
some
cases
at
least
probably
using
their
small
front
limbs
to
hold
or
grasp
their
food
the
first
group
was
carnivorous
the
second
herbivorous
and
as
the
reptiles
of
the
first
group
had
four
or
five
toes
on
each
foot
they
are
known
as
the
theropods
or
while
those
of
the
second
order
which
had
three
toes
are
called
the
ornithopods
or
each
of
them
then
gave
birth
to
an
order
of
quadrupeds
in
the
spreading
waters
and
rich
swamps
of
the
later
triassic
some
of
the
theropods
were
attracted
to
return
to
an
amphibious
life
and
became
the
vast
sprawling
ponderous
sauropods
the
giants
in
a
world
of
giants
on
the
other
hand
a
branch
of
the
vegetarian
ornithopods
developed
heavy
armour
for
defence
against
the
carnivores
and
became
under
the
burden
of
its
weight
the
quadrupedal
and
monstrous
stegosauria
and
ceratopsia
taking
this
instructive
general
view
of
the
spread
of
the
deinosaurs
as
the
best
interpretation
of
the
material
we
have
we
may
now
glance
at
each
of
the
orders
in
succession
the
theropods
varied
considerably
in
size
and
agility
the
compsognathus
was
a
small
active
creature
standing
about
two
feet
high
on
its
hind
limbs
while
the
megalosaurs
stretched
to
a
length
of
thirty
feet
and
had
huge
jaws
armed
with
rows
of
formidable
teeth
the
ceratosaur
a
reptile
had
hollow
bones
and
we
find
this
combination
of
lightness
and
strength
in
several
members
of
the
group
in
many
respects
the
group
points
more
or
less
significantly
toward
the
birds
the
brain
is
relatively
large
the
neck
long
and
the
fore
limbs
might
be
used
for
grasping
but
had
apparently
ceased
to
serve
as
legs
many
of
the
theropods
were
evidently
leaping
reptiles
like
colossal
kangaroos
twenty
or
more
feet
in
length
when
they
were
erect
it
is
the
general
belief
that
the
bird
began
its
career
as
a
leaping
reptile
and
the
feathers
or
expanded
scales
on
the
front
limbs
helped
at
first
to
increase
the
leap
some
recent
authorities
hold
however
that
the
ancestor
of
the
bird
was
an
arboreal
reptile
to
the
order
of
the
sauropods
belong
most
of
the
monsters
whose
discovery
has
attracted
general
attention
in
recent
years
feeding
on
vegetal
matter
in
the
luscious
swamps
and
having
their
vast
bulk
lightened
by
their
aquatic
life
they
soon
attained
the
most
formidable
proportions
the
admirer
of
the
enormous
skeleton
of
diplodocus
which
ran
to
eighty
feet
in
the
british
museum
must
wonder
how
even
such
massive
limbs
could
sustain
the
mountain
of
flesh
that
must
have
covered
those
bones
it
probably
did
not
walk
so
firmly
as
the
skeleton
suggests
but
sprawled
in
the
swamps
or
swam
like
a
hippopotamus
but
the
diplodocus
is
neither
the
largest
nor
heaviest
of
its
family
the
brontosaur
though
only
sixty
feet
long
probably
weighed
twenty
tons
we
have
its
footprints
in
the
rocks
each
impression
measuring
about
a
square
yard
generally
it
is
the
huge
of
these
monsters
that
have
survived
and
give
us
an
idea
of
their
size
the
largest
living
elephant
has
a
femur
scarcely
four
feet
long
but
the
femur
of
the
atlantosaur
measures
more
than
seventy
inches
and
the
femur
of
the
brachiosaur
more
than
eighty
many
of
these
deinosaurs
must
have
measured
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
the
tip
of
the
snout
to
the
end
of
the
tail
and
stood
about
thirty
feet
high
from
the
ground
the
european
sauropods
did
not
apparently
reach
the
size
of
their
american
cousins
so
early
did
the
inferiority
of
europe
begin
but
our
ceteosaur
seems
to
have
been
about
fifty
feet
long
and
ten
feet
in
height
its
was
inches
long
and
inches
in
circumference
at
the
shaft
and
in
this
order
of
reptiles
it
must
be
remembered
the
bones
are
solid
to
complete
the
picture
of
the
sauropods
we
must
add
that
the
whole
class
is
characterised
by
the
extraordinary
smallness
of
the
brain
the
brontosaur
had
a
brain
no
larger
than
that
of
a
human
infant
quite
commonly
the
brain
of
one
of
these
enormous
animals
is
no
larger
than
a
man
fist
it
is
true
that
as
far
as
the
muscular
and
sexual
labour
was
concerned
the
brain
was
supplemented
by
a
great
enlargement
of
the
spinal
cord
in
the
sacral
region
at
the
top
of
the
thighs
this
inferior
brain
was
from
ten
to
twenty
times
as
large
as
the
brain
in
the
skull
it
would
however
be
fully
occupied
with
the
movement
of
the
monstrous
limbs
and
tail
and
the
and
does
not
add
in
the
least
to
the
mental
power
of
the
sauropods
they
were
stupid
sluggish
unwieldy
creatures
swollen
parasites
upon
a
luxuriant
vegetation
and
we
shall
easily
understand
their
disappearance
at
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
era
when
the
age
of
brawn
will
yield
to
an
age
of
brain
the
next
order
of
the
deinosaurs
is
that
of
the
biped
vegetarians
the
ornithopods
which
gradually
became
heavily
armoured
and
quadrupedal
the
familiar
iguanodon
is
the
chief
representative
of
this
order
in
europe
walking
on
its
hind
limbs
its
head
would
be
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
the
front
part
of
its
jaws
was
toothless
and
covered
with
horn
it
had
in
fact
a
kind
of
beak
and
it
also
approached
the
primitive
bird
in
the
structure
of
its
pelvis
and
in
having
five
toes
on
its
small
front
limbs
some
of
the
ornithopods
such
as
the
laosaur
were
small
three
or
four
feet
in
height
and
active
but
many
of
the
american
specimens
attained
a
great
size
the
camptosaur
which
was
closely
related
to
the
iguanodon
in
structure
was
thirty
feet
from
the
snout
to
the
end
of
the
tail
and
the
head
probably
stood
eighteen
feet
from
the
ground
one
of
the
last
great
representatives
of
the
group
in
america
the
trachodon
about
thirty
feet
in
length
had
a
most
extraordinary
head
it
was
about
three
and
a
half
feet
in
length
and
had
no
less
than
teeth
lining
the
mouth
cavity
it
is
conjectured
that
it
fed
on
vegetation
containing
a
large
proportion
of
silica
in
the
course
of
the
jurassic
as
we
saw
a
branch
of
these
biped
vegetarians
developed
heavy
armour
and
returned
to
the
quadrupedal
habit
we
find
them
both
in
europe
and
america
and
must
suppose
that
the
highway
across
the
north
atlantic
still
existed
the
stegosaur
is
one
of
the
most
singular
and
most
familiar
representatives
of
the
group
in
the
jurassic
it
ran
to
a
length
of
thirty
feet
and
had
a
row
of
bony
plates
from
two
to
three
feet
in
height
standing
up
vertically
along
the
ridge
of
its
back
while
its
tail
was
armed
with
formidable
spikes
the
scleidosaur
an
earlier
and
smaller
specimen
also
had
spines
and
bony
plates
to
protect
it
the
polacanthus
and
ankylosaur
developed
a
most
effective
over
the
rear
as
we
regard
their
powerful
armour
we
seem
to
see
the
theropods
springing
from
the
rear
upon
the
vegetarians
the
carnivores
selected
the
vegetarians
and
fitted
them
to
survive
before
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
in
fact
the
ornithopods
became
aggressive
as
well
as
armoured
the
triceratops
had
not
only
an
enormous
skull
with
a
great
ridged
collar
round
the
neck
but
a
sharp
beak
a
stout
horn
on
the
nose
and
two
large
and
sharp
horns
on
the
top
of
the
head
we
will
see
something
later
of
the
development
of
horns
the
skulls
of
members
of
the
ceratops
family
sometimes
measured
eight
feet
from
the
snout
to
the
ridge
of
the
collar
they
were
however
sluggish
and
stupid
monsters
with
smaller
brains
even
than
the
sauropods
such
in
broad
outline
was
the
singular
and
powerful
family
of
the
mesozoic
deinosaurs
further
geological
research
in
all
parts
of
the
world
will
no
doubt
increase
our
knowledge
of
them
until
we
can
fully
understand
them
as
a
great
family
throwing
out
special
branches
to
meet
the
different
conditions
of
the
crowded
jurassic
age
even
now
they
afford
a
most
interesting
page
in
the
story
of
evolution
and
their
total
disappearance
from
the
face
of
the
earth
in
the
next
geological
period
will
not
be
unintelligible
we
turn
from
them
to
the
remaining
orders
of
the
jurassic
reptiles
in
the
popular
mind
perhaps
the
ichthyosaur
and
plesiosaur
are
the
typical
representatives
of
that
extinct
race
the
two
animals
however
belong
to
very
different
branches
of
the
reptile
world
and
are
by
no
means
the
most
formidable
of
the
mesozoic
reptiles
many
orders
of
the
land
reptiles
sent
a
branch
into
the
waters
in
an
age
which
we
saw
was
predominantly
one
of
the
ichthyosauria
and
thalattosauria
invaded
the
waters
at
their
first
expansion
in
the
later
triassic
the
latter
groups
soon
became
extinct
but
the
former
continued
for
some
millions
of
years
and
became
remarkably
adapted
to
marine
life
like
the
whale
at
a
later
period
the
ichthyosaur
of
the
jurassic
is
a
remarkably
animal
its
long
tapering
frame
sometimes
forty
feet
in
length
but
generally
less
than
half
that
length
ends
in
a
dip
of
the
vertebral
column
and
an
expansion
of
the
flesh
into
a
strong
the
terminal
bones
of
the
limbs
depart
more
and
more
from
the
quadruped
type
until
at
last
they
are
merely
rows
of
circular
bony
plates
embedded
in
the
broad
paddle
into
which
the
limb
has
been
converted
the
head
is
drawn
out
sometimes
to
a
length
of
five
feet
and
the
long
narrow
jaws
are
set
with
two
formidable
rows
of
teeth
one
specimen
has
about
two
hundred
teeth
in
some
genera
the
teeth
degenerate
in
the
course
of
time
but
this
merely
indicates
a
change
of
diet
one
fossilised
ichthyosaur
of
the
variety
has
been
found
with
the
remains
of
two
hundred
belemnites
in
its
stomach
it
is
a
flash
of
light
on
the
fierce
struggle
and
carnage
which
some
recent
writers
have
vainly
striven
to
attenuate
the
eyes
again
which
may
in
the
larger
animals
be
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
are
protected
by
a
circle
of
radiating
bony
plates
in
fine
the
discovery
of
young
developed
skeletons
inside
the
adult
frames
has
taught
us
that
the
ichthgosaur
had
become
viviparous
like
the
mammal
cutting
its
last
connection
with
the
land
on
which
it
originated
it
ceased
to
lay
eggs
and
developed
the
young
within
its
body
the
ichthyosaur
came
of
the
reptile
group
which
we
have
called
the
diapsids
the
plesiosaur
seems
to
belong
to
the
synapsid
branch
in
the
earlier
mesozoic
we
find
partially
aquatic
representatives
of
the
line
like
the
nothosaur
and
in
the
later
plesiosaur
the
adaptation
to
a
marine
life
is
complete
the
skin
has
lost
its
scales
and
the
front
limbs
are
developed
into
powerful
paddles
sometimes
six
feet
in
length
the
neck
is
drawn
out
until
in
some
specimens
it
is
found
to
consist
of
vertebrae
the
longest
neck
in
the
animal
world
it
is
now
doubted
however
if
the
neck
was
very
flexible
and
as
the
jaws
were
imperfectly
joined
the
common
picture
of
the
plesiosaur
darting
its
neck
in
all
directions
to
seize
its
prey
is
probably
wrong
it
seems
to
have
lived
on
small
food
and
been
itself
a
rich
diet
to
the
larger
carnivores
we
find
it
in
all
the
seas
of
the
mesozoic
world
varying
in
length
from
six
to
forty
feet
but
it
is
one
of
the
sluggish
and
unwieldy
forms
that
are
destined
to
perish
in
the
coming
crisis
the
last
and
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
the
doomed
monsters
of
the
mesozoic
was
the
pterosaur
or
flying
reptile
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
the
fierce
struggle
which
is
reflected
in
the
arms
and
armour
of
the
great
reptiles
a
branch
of
the
family
escaped
into
the
upper
region
we
have
seen
that
there
were
leaping
reptiles
with
hollow
bones
and
although
the
intermediate
forms
are
missing
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
pterosaur
developed
from
one
or
more
of
these
leaping
deinosaurs
as
it
is
at
first
small
when
it
appears
in
the
early
jurassic
it
is
disputed
in
the
late
triassic
it
probably
came
from
a
small
and
agile
deinosaur
hunted
by
the
carnivores
which
relied
on
its
leaping
powers
for
escape
a
flapperlike
broadening
of
the
fore
limbs
would
help
to
lengthen
the
leap
and
we
must
suppose
that
this
membrane
increased
until
the
animal
could
sail
through
the
air
like
the
and
eventually
sustain
its
weight
in
the
air
the
wing
is
of
course
not
a
feathery
frame
as
in
the
bird
but
a
special
skin
spreading
between
the
fore
limb
and
the
side
of
the
body
in
the
bat
this
skin
is
supported
by
four
elongated
fingers
of
the
hand
but
in
the
pterosaur
the
fifth
or
fourth
finger
alone
which
is
enormously
elongated
and
strengthened
forms
its
outer
frame
it
is
as
if
in
flying
experiments
a
man
were
to
have
a
web
of
silk
stretching
from
his
arm
and
an
extension
of
his
little
finger
to
the
side
of
his
body
from
the
small
early
specimens
in
the
early
jurassic
the
flying
reptiles
grow
larger
and
larger
until
the
time
of
their
extinction
in
the
stresses
of
the
chalk
upheaval
small
pterosaurs
continue
throughout
the
period
but
from
these
creatures
we
rise
until
we
come
to
such
dragons
as
the
american
pteranodon
with
a
stretch
of
feet
between
its
extended
wings
and
jaws
about
four
feet
long
there
were
pterosaurs
ramphorhyncus
sometimes
with
a
expansion
of
the
end
of
the
tail
and
pterosaurs
pterodactyl
with
compact
bodies
and
keeled
breasts
like
the
bird
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
period
they
all
have
the
heavy
jaws
and
numerous
teeth
of
the
reptile
with
four
or
five
fingers
on
the
front
limbs
in
the
course
of
time
they
lose
the
teeth
an
advantage
in
the
distribution
of
the
weight
of
the
body
while
flying
and
develop
horny
beaks
in
the
gradual
shaping
of
the
and
head
also
they
illustrate
the
evolution
of
the
but
the
birds
were
meantime
developing
from
a
quite
different
stock
and
would
replace
the
pterosaurs
at
the
first
change
in
the
environment
there
is
ground
for
thinking
that
these
flying
reptiles
were
like
the
birds
their
hollow
bones
seem
to
point
to
the
effective
breathing
of
a
animal
and
the
great
vitality
they
would
need
in
flying
points
toward
the
same
conclusion
their
brain
too
approached
that
of
the
bird
and
was
much
superior
to
that
of
the
other
reptiles
but
they
had
no
warm
coats
to
retain
their
heat
no
clavicle
to
give
strength
to
the
wing
machinery
and
especially
in
the
later
period
they
became
very
weak
in
the
hind
limbs
and
therefore
weak
or
slow
in
starting
their
flight
the
coming
selection
will
therefore
dismiss
them
from
the
scene
with
the
deinosaurs
and
ammonites
and
retain
the
better
organised
bird
as
the
lord
of
the
air
there
remain
one
or
two
groups
of
the
mesozoic
reptiles
which
are
still
represented
in
nature
the
chelonia
makes
its
appearance
in
the
triassic
and
thrives
in
the
jurassic
its
members
are
extinct
and
primitive
forms
of
the
reptiles
but
true
turtles
both
of
marine
and
fresh
water
abound
before
the
close
of
the
mesozoic
the
attain
an
enormous
size
archelon
one
of
the
primitive
types
measured
about
twelve
feet
across
the
shell
another
was
thirteen
feet
long
and
fifteen
feet
from
one
outstretched
flipper
to
the
other
in
the
chalk
period
they
form
more
than
a
third
of
the
reptile
remains
in
some
regions
they
are
extremely
interesting
in
that
they
show
to
some
extent
the
evolution
of
their
characteristic
shell
in
some
of
the
larger
specimens
the
ribs
have
not
yet
entirely
coalesced
the
crocodilians
also
appear
in
the
later
triassic
abound
in
the
jurassic
and
give
way
before
the
later
types
the
true
crocodiles
in
the
cretaceous
they
were
marine
animals
with
naked
skin
a
head
and
neck
something
like
that
of
the
ichthyosaur
and
paddles
like
those
of
the
plesiosaur
their
back
limbs
however
were
not
much
changed
after
their
adaptation
to
life
in
the
sea
and
it
is
concluded
that
they
visited
the
land
to
lay
their
eggs
the
teleosaur
was
a
formidable
reptile
somewhat
resembling
the
crocodiles
of
the
ganges
in
the
external
form
of
the
jaws
the
modern
crocodiles
which
replaced
this
ancient
race
of
have
a
great
advantage
over
them
in
the
fact
that
their
nostrils
open
into
the
mouth
in
its
lower
depths
they
can
therefore
close
their
teeth
on
their
prey
under
water
and
breathe
through
the
nose
snakes
are
not
found
until
the
close
of
the
mesozoic
and
do
not
figure
in
its
characteristic
reptile
population
we
will
consider
them
later
but
there
was
a
large
group
of
reptiles
in
the
later
mesozoic
seas
which
more
or
less
correspond
to
the
legendary
idea
of
a
these
dolichosaurs
long
reptiles
appear
at
the
beginning
of
the
chalk
period
and
develop
into
a
group
the
mososaurians
which
must
have
added
considerably
to
the
terrors
of
the
their
slender
bodies
were
commonly
twenty
to
thirty
feet
in
length
the
supreme
representative
of
the
order
the
mososaur
of
which
about
forty
species
are
known
was
sometimes
feet
long
it
had
two
pairs
of
paddles
so
that
the
name
of
is
very
imperfectly
applicable
and
four
rows
of
formidable
teeth
on
the
roof
of
its
mouth
like
the
deinosaurs
and
pterosaurs
the
order
was
doomed
to
be
entirely
extinguished
after
a
brief
supremacy
in
its
environment
from
this
short
and
summary
catalogue
the
reader
will
be
able
to
form
some
conception
of
the
living
inhabitants
of
the
mesozoic
world
it
is
assuredly
the
age
of
reptiles
worms
snails
and
spiders
were
we
may
assume
abundant
enough
and
a
great
variety
of
insects
flitted
from
tree
to
tree
or
sheltered
in
the
fern
brakes
but
the
characteristic
life
in
water
and
on
land
was
the
vast
and
diversified
family
of
the
reptiles
in
the
western
and
the
eastern
continent
and
along
the
narrowing
bridge
that
still
united
them
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
the
southern
and
along
every
ridge
of
land
that
connected
them
these
sluggish
but
formidable
monsters
filled
the
stage
every
conceivable
device
in
the
way
of
arms
and
armour
brute
strength
and
means
of
escape
seemed
to
be
adopted
in
their
development
as
if
they
were
the
final
and
indestructible
outcome
of
the
and
within
a
single
geological
period
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
especially
the
larger
and
more
formidable
of
them
were
ruthlessly
slain
leaving
not
a
single
descendant
on
the
earth
let
us
see
what
types
of
animals
were
thus
preferred
to
them
in
the
next
great
application
of
selective
processes
chapter
xiii
the
bird
and
the
mammal
in
one
of
his
finest
stories
sur
la
pierre
blanche
anatole
france
has
imagined
a
group
of
roman
patricians
discussing
the
future
of
their
empire
the
christians
who
are
about
to
rise
to
power
on
their
ruin
they
dismiss
with
amiable
indifference
as
one
of
the
little
passing
eccentricities
of
the
religious
life
of
their
time
they
have
not
the
dimmest
prevision
even
as
the
dream
of
a
possibility
that
in
a
century
or
two
the
empire
of
rome
will
lie
in
the
dust
and
the
cross
will
tower
above
all
its
cities
from
york
to
jerusalem
if
we
might
for
a
moment
endow
the
animals
of
the
mesozoic
world
with
aesopian
wisdom
we
could
imagine
some
such
discussion
taking
place
between
a
group
of
deinosaur
patricians
they
would
reflect
with
pride
on
the
unshakable
empire
of
the
reptiles
and
perhaps
glance
with
disdain
at
two
types
of
animals
which
hid
in
the
recesses
or
fled
to
the
hills
of
the
jurassic
world
and
before
another
era
of
the
earth
story
opened
the
reptile
race
would
be
dethroned
and
these
hunted
and
despised
and
feeble
eccentricities
of
mesozoic
life
would
become
the
masters
of
the
globe
these
two
types
of
organisms
were
the
bird
and
the
mammal
both
existed
in
the
jurassic
and
the
mammals
at
least
had
many
representatives
in
the
triassic
in
other
words
they
existed
with
all
their
higher
organisation
during
several
million
years
without
attaining
power
the
mammals
remained
during
at
least
years
a
small
and
obscure
caste
immensely
overshadowed
by
the
reptiles
the
birds
while
making
more
progress
apparently
than
the
mammals
were
far
outnumbered
by
the
flying
reptiles
until
the
last
part
of
the
mesozoic
then
there
was
another
momentous
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fate
and
they
emerged
from
their
obscurity
to
assume
the
lordship
of
the
globe
in
earlier
years
when
some
serious
hesitation
was
felt
by
many
to
accept
the
new
doctrine
of
evolution
a
grave
difficulty
was
found
in
the
circumstance
that
new
types
not
merely
new
species
and
new
genera
but
new
orders
and
even
appeared
in
the
geological
record
quite
suddenly
was
it
not
a
singular
coincidence
that
in
all
cases
the
intermediate
organisms
between
one
type
and
another
should
have
wholly
escaped
preservation
the
difficulty
was
generally
due
to
an
imperfect
acquaintance
with
the
conditions
of
the
problem
the
fossil
population
of
a
period
is
only
that
fraction
of
its
living
population
which
happened
to
be
buried
in
a
certain
kind
of
deposit
under
water
of
a
certain
depth
we
shall
read
later
of
insects
being
preserved
in
resin
amber
and
we
have
animals
and
even
bacteria
preserved
in
trees
from
the
generally
speaking
however
the
earth
has
buried
only
a
very
minute
fraction
of
its
moreover
only
a
fraction
of
the
earth
cemeteries
have
yet
been
opened
when
we
further
reflect
that
the
new
type
of
organism
when
it
first
appears
is
a
small
and
local
group
we
see
what
the
chances
are
of
our
finding
specimens
of
it
in
a
few
scattered
pages
of
a
very
fragmentary
record
of
the
life
we
shall
see
that
we
have
discovered
only
about
ten
skeletons
or
fragments
of
skeletons
of
the
men
who
lived
on
the
earth
before
the
neolithic
period
a
stretch
of
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
recorded
in
the
upper
strata
of
the
earth
whatever
serious
difficulty
there
ever
was
in
this
scantiness
of
intermediate
types
is
amply
met
by
the
fact
that
every
fresh
decade
of
search
in
the
geological
tombs
brings
some
to
light
we
have
seen
many
instances
of
this
the
ferns
and
cycads
for
example
found
in
the
last
decade
and
will
see
others
but
one
of
the
most
remarkable
cases
of
the
kind
now
claims
our
attention
the
bird
was
probably
evolved
in
the
late
triassic
or
early
jurassic
it
appears
in
abundance
divided
into
several
genera
in
the
chalk
period
luckily
two
have
been
found
in
the
intermediate
period
the
jurassic
and
they
are
of
the
intermediate
type
between
the
reptile
and
the
bird
which
the
theory
of
evolution
would
suggest
but
for
the
fortunate
accident
of
these
two
birds
being
embedded
in
an
ancient
bavarian
which
happened
to
be
opened
for
commercial
purposes
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
critics
of
evolution
if
there
still
were
any
in
the
world
of
science
might
be
repeating
that
the
transition
from
the
reptile
to
the
bird
was
unthinkable
in
theory
and
unproven
in
fact
the
features
of
the
archaeopteryx
primitive
bird
have
been
described
so
often
and
such
excellent
pictorial
restorations
of
its
appearance
may
now
be
seen
that
we
may
deal
with
it
briefly
we
have
in
it
a
most
instructive
combination
of
the
characters
of
the
bird
and
the
reptile
the
feathers
alone
the
imprint
of
which
is
excellently
preserved
in
the
fine
limestone
would
indicate
its
bird
nature
but
other
anatomical
distinctions
are
clearly
seen
in
it
there
is
says
woodward
a
typical
bird
between
the
wings
and
the
hind
leg
is
exactly
that
of
a
perching
bird
in
other
words
it
has
the
and
foot
as
well
as
the
feathers
of
a
bird
on
the
other
hand
it
has
a
long
tail
instead
of
a
terminal
tuft
of
feathers
as
in
the
bird
consisting
of
vertebrae
with
the
feathers
springing
in
pairs
from
either
side
it
has
biconcave
vertebrae
like
the
fishes
amphibia
and
reptiles
it
has
teeth
in
its
jaws
and
it
has
three
complete
fingers
free
and
clawed
on
its
front
limbs
as
in
the
living
peripatus
therefore
we
have
here
a
very
valuable
connecting
link
between
two
very
different
types
of
organisms
it
is
clear
that
one
of
the
smaller
reptiles
the
archaeopteryx
is
between
a
pigeon
and
a
crow
in
size
of
the
triassic
period
was
the
ancestor
of
the
birds
its
most
conspicuous
distinction
was
that
it
developed
a
coat
of
feathers
a
more
important
difference
between
the
bird
and
the
reptile
is
that
the
heart
of
the
bird
is
completely
divided
into
four
chambers
but
as
we
saw
this
probably
occurred
also
in
the
other
flying
reptiles
it
may
be
said
to
be
almost
a
condition
of
the
greater
energy
of
a
flying
animal
when
the
heart
has
four
complete
chambers
the
carbonised
blood
from
the
tissues
of
the
body
can
be
conveyed
direct
to
the
lungs
for
purification
and
the
aerated
blood
taken
direct
to
the
tissues
without
any
mingling
of
the
two
in
the
and
amphibian
we
saw
the
heart
has
two
chambers
auricles
above
but
one
ventricle
below
in
which
the
pure
and
impure
blood
mingle
in
the
reptiles
a
partition
begins
to
form
in
the
lower
chamber
in
the
turtle
it
is
so
nearly
complete
that
the
venous
and
the
arterial
blood
are
fairly
separated
in
the
crocodile
it
is
quite
complete
though
the
arteries
are
imperfectly
arranged
thus
the
heart
of
the
bird
and
mammal
is
not
a
sudden
and
inexplicable
development
its
advantage
is
enormous
in
a
cold
climate
the
purer
supply
of
blood
increases
the
combustion
in
the
tissues
and
the
animal
maintains
its
temperature
and
vitality
when
the
surrounding
air
falls
in
temperature
it
ceases
to
be
but
the
bird
secures
a
further
advantage
and
here
it
outstrips
the
flying
reptile
the
naked
skin
of
the
pterosaur
would
allow
the
heat
to
escape
so
freely
when
the
atmosphere
cooled
that
a
great
strain
would
be
laid
on
its
vitality
a
man
lessens
the
demand
on
his
vitality
in
cold
regions
by
wearing
clothing
the
bird
somehow
obtained
clothing
in
the
shape
of
a
coat
of
feathers
and
had
more
vitality
to
spare
for
in
a
falling
temperature
the
reptile
is
strictly
limited
to
one
region
the
bird
can
pass
from
region
to
region
as
food
becomes
scarce
the
question
of
the
origin
of
the
feathers
can
be
discussed
only
from
the
speculative
point
of
view
as
they
are
fully
developed
in
the
archaeopteryx
and
there
is
no
approach
toward
them
in
any
other
living
or
fossil
organism
but
a
long
discussion
of
the
problem
has
convinced
scientific
men
that
the
feathers
are
evolved
from
the
scales
of
the
reptile
ancestor
the
analogy
between
the
shedding
of
the
coat
in
a
snake
and
the
moulting
of
a
bird
is
not
uninstructive
in
both
cases
the
outer
skin
or
epidermis
is
shedding
an
old
growth
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
one
the
covering
or
horny
part
of
the
scale
and
the
feather
are
alike
growths
from
the
epidermis
and
the
initial
stages
of
the
growth
have
certain
analogies
but
beyond
this
general
conviction
that
the
feather
is
a
development
of
the
scale
we
can
not
proceed
with
any
confidence
nor
need
we
linger
in
attempting
to
trace
the
gradual
modification
of
the
skeleton
owing
to
the
material
change
in
habits
the
horny
beak
and
the
reduction
of
the
toes
are
features
we
have
already
encountered
in
the
reptile
and
the
modification
of
the
pelvis
and
clavicle
are
a
natural
outcome
of
flight
in
the
chalk
period
we
find
a
large
number
of
bird
remains
of
about
thirty
different
species
and
in
some
respects
they
resume
the
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
bird
they
are
widely
removed
from
our
modern
types
of
birds
and
still
have
teeth
in
the
jaws
they
are
of
two
leading
types
of
which
the
ichthyornis
and
hesperornis
are
the
standard
specimens
the
ichthyornis
was
a
small
bird
with
the
power
of
flight
strongly
developed
as
we
may
gather
from
the
frame
of
its
wings
and
the
structure
of
its
its
legs
and
feet
were
small
and
slender
and
its
long
slender
jaws
had
about
twenty
teeth
on
each
side
at
the
bottom
no
modern
bird
has
teeth
though
the
fact
that
in
some
modern
species
we
find
the
teeth
appearing
in
a
rudimentary
form
is
another
illustration
of
the
law
that
animals
tend
to
reproduce
ancestral
features
in
their
development
a
more
reptilian
character
in
the
ichthyornis
group
is
the
fact
that
unlike
any
modern
bird
but
like
their
reptile
ancestors
they
had
biconcave
vertebrae
the
brain
was
relatively
poor
we
are
still
dealing
with
a
type
intermediate
in
some
respects
between
the
reptile
and
the
modern
bird
the
gannets
cormorants
and
pelicans
are
believed
to
descend
from
some
branch
of
this
group
the
other
group
of
cretaceous
birds
of
the
hesperornis
type
show
an
actual
degeneration
of
the
power
of
flight
through
adaptation
to
an
environment
in
which
it
was
not
needed
as
happened
later
in
the
kiwi
of
new
zealand
and
is
happening
in
the
case
of
the
fowl
these
birds
had
become
divers
their
wings
had
shrunk
into
an
abortive
bone
while
their
powerful
legs
had
been
peculiarly
fitted
for
diving
they
stood
out
at
right
angles
to
the
body
and
seem
to
have
developed
paddles
the
whole
frame
suggests
that
the
bird
could
neither
walk
nor
fly
but
was
an
excellent
diver
and
swimmer
not
infrequently
as
large
as
an
ostrich
five
to
six
feet
high
with
teeth
set
in
grooves
in
its
jaws
and
the
jaws
themselves
joined
as
in
the
snake
with
a
great
capacity
of
bolting
its
prey
the
hesperornis
would
become
an
important
element
in
the
life
of
the
fishes
the
have
gone
and
the
tail
is
much
shortened
but
the
grooved
teeth
and
loosely
jointed
jaws
still
point
back
to
a
reptilian
ancestry
these
are
the
only
remains
of
that
we
find
in
the
mesozoic
rocks
admirably
as
they
illustrate
the
evolution
of
the
bird
from
the
reptile
they
seem
to
represent
a
relatively
poor
development
and
spread
of
one
of
the
most
advanced
organisms
of
the
time
it
must
be
understood
that
as
we
shall
see
the
latter
part
of
the
chalk
period
does
not
belong
to
the
depression
the
age
of
genial
climate
which
i
call
the
middle
ages
of
the
earth
but
to
the
revolutionary
period
which
closes
it
we
may
say
that
the
bird
for
all
its
advances
in
organisation
remains
obscure
and
unprosperous
as
long
as
the
age
of
reptiles
lasts
it
awaits
the
next
massive
uplift
of
the
land
and
lowering
of
temperature
in
an
earlier
chapter
i
hinted
that
the
bird
and
the
mammal
may
have
been
the
supreme
outcomes
of
the
series
of
disturbances
which
closed
the
primary
epoch
and
devastated
its
primitive
population
as
far
as
the
bird
is
concerned
this
may
be
doubted
on
the
ground
that
it
first
appears
in
the
upper
or
later
jurassic
and
is
even
then
still
largely
reptilian
in
character
we
must
remember
however
that
the
elevation
of
the
land
and
the
cold
climate
lasted
until
the
second
part
of
the
triassic
and
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
bird
may
have
been
evolved
in
the
triassic
its
slow
progress
after
that
date
is
not
difficult
to
understand
the
advantage
of
a
heart
and
warm
coat
would
be
greatly
reduced
when
the
climate
became
warmer
the
stimulus
to
advance
would
relax
the
change
from
a
coat
of
scales
to
a
coat
of
feathers
obviously
means
adaptation
to
a
low
temperature
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
locating
it
in
the
triassic
and
indeed
no
later
known
period
of
cold
in
which
to
place
it
it
is
much
clearer
that
the
mammals
were
a
product
of
the
permian
revolution
they
not
only
abound
throughout
the
jurassic
in
which
they
are
distributed
in
more
than
thirty
genera
but
they
may
be
traced
into
the
triassic
itself
both
in
north
america
and
europe
we
find
the
teeth
and
fragments
of
the
jaws
of
small
animals
which
are
generally
recognised
as
mammals
we
can
not
of
course
from
a
few
bones
deduce
that
there
already
in
the
triassic
existed
an
animal
with
a
fully
developed
coat
of
fur
and
an
apparatus
however
crude
in
the
breast
for
suckling
the
young
but
these
bones
so
closely
resemble
the
bones
of
the
lowest
mammals
of
that
this
seems
highly
probable
in
the
latter
part
of
the
long
period
of
cold
it
seems
that
some
reptile
exchanged
its
scales
for
tufts
of
hair
developed
a
heart
and
began
the
practice
of
nourishing
the
young
from
its
own
blood
which
would
give
the
mammals
so
great
an
ascendancy
in
a
colder
world
nor
can
we
complain
of
any
lack
of
evidence
connecting
the
mammal
with
a
reptile
ancestor
the
earliest
remains
we
find
are
of
such
a
nature
that
the
highest
authorities
are
still
at
variance
as
to
whether
they
should
be
classed
as
reptilian
or
mammalian
a
skull
and
a
fore
limb
from
the
triassic
of
south
africa
tritylodon
and
theriodesmus
are
in
this
predicament
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
divided
the
primitive
reptiles
of
the
permian
period
into
two
great
groups
the
diapsids
and
synapsids
or
theromorphs
the
former
group
have
spread
into
the
great
reptiles
of
the
jurassic
the
latter
have
remained
in
comparative
obscurity
one
branch
of
these
theromorph
reptiles
approach
the
mammals
so
closely
in
the
formation
of
the
teeth
that
they
have
received
the
name
of
the
theriodonts
or
reptiles
their
teeth
are
like
those
of
the
mammals
divided
into
incisors
canines
sometimes
several
inches
long
and
molars
and
the
molars
have
in
some
cases
developed
cusps
or
tubercles
as
the
earlier
remains
of
mammals
which
we
find
are
generally
teeth
and
jaws
the
resemblance
of
the
two
groups
leads
to
some
confusion
in
classifying
them
but
from
our
point
of
view
it
is
not
unwelcome
it
narrows
the
supposed
gulf
between
the
reptile
and
the
mammal
and
suggests
very
forcibly
the
particular
branch
of
the
reptiles
to
which
we
may
look
for
the
ancestry
of
the
mammals
we
can
not
say
that
these
theriodont
reptiles
were
the
ancestors
of
the
mammals
but
we
may
conclude
with
some
confidence
that
they
bring
us
near
to
the
point
of
origin
and
probably
had
at
least
a
common
ancestor
with
the
mammals
the
distribution
of
the
theriodonts
suggests
a
further
idea
of
interest
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
the
mammals
it
would
be
improper
to
press
this
view
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
yet
it
offers
a
plausible
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
mammals
the
theriodonts
seem
to
have
been
generally
confined
to
the
southern
continent
gondwana
land
brazil
to
australia
of
which
an
area
survives
in
south
africa
it
is
there
also
that
we
find
the
early
disputed
remains
of
mammals
now
we
saw
that
during
the
permian
gondwana
land
was
heavily
coated
with
ice
and
it
seems
natural
to
suppose
that
the
severe
cold
which
the
glacial
fields
would
give
to
the
whole
southern
continent
was
the
great
agency
in
the
evolution
of
the
highest
type
of
the
animal
world
from
this
southern
land
the
mammals
spread
northward
and
eastward
with
great
rapidity
fitted
as
they
were
to
withstand
the
rigorous
conditions
which
held
the
reptiles
and
amphibia
in
check
they
seemed
destined
to
attain
at
once
the
domination
of
the
earth
then
as
we
saw
the
land
was
revelled
once
more
until
its
surface
broke
into
a
fresh
luxuriance
and
the
deinosaurs
advanced
to
their
triumph
the
mammals
shrank
into
a
meagre
and
insignificant
population
a
scattered
tribe
of
small
animals
awaiting
a
fresh
refrigeration
of
the
globe
the
remains
of
these
interesting
early
mammals
restricted
as
they
generally
are
to
jaws
and
teeth
and
a
few
other
bones
that
can
not
in
themselves
be
too
confidently
distinguished
from
those
of
certain
reptiles
may
seem
insufficient
to
enable
us
to
form
a
picture
of
their
living
forms
in
this
however
we
receive
a
singular
and
fortunate
assistance
some
of
them
are
found
living
in
nature
and
their
distinctly
reptilian
features
would
even
if
no
fossil
remains
were
in
existence
convince
us
of
the
evolution
of
the
mammals
the
southern
continent
on
which
we
suppose
the
mammals
to
have
originated
had
its
eastern
termination
in
australia
new
zealand
seems
to
have
been
detached
early
in
the
mesozoic
and
was
never
reached
by
the
mammals
tasmania
was
still
part
of
the
australian
continent
to
this
extreme
east
of
the
southern
continent
the
early
mammals
spread
and
then
during
either
the
jurassic
or
the
cretaceous
the
sea
completed
its
inroad
and
severed
australia
permanently
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
the
obvious
result
of
this
was
to
shelter
the
primitive
life
of
australia
from
invasion
by
higher
types
especially
from
the
great
carnivorous
mammals
which
would
presently
develop
australia
became
in
other
words
a
protected
area
in
which
primitive
types
of
life
were
preserved
from
destruction
and
were
at
the
same
time
sheltered
from
those
stimulating
agencies
which
compelled
the
rest
of
the
world
to
advance
advance
australia
is
the
fitting
motto
of
the
present
human
inhabitants
of
that
promising
country
but
the
standard
of
progress
has
been
set
up
in
a
land
which
had
remained
during
millions
of
years
the
chinese
empire
of
the
living
world
australia
is
a
fragment
of
the
middle
ages
of
the
earth
a
province
fenced
round
by
nature
at
least
three
million
years
ago
and
preserving
amongst
its
many
invaluable
types
of
life
representatives
of
that
primitive
mammal
population
which
we
are
seeking
to
understand
it

now
well
known
that
the
duckbill
or
platypus
ornithorhyncus

the
spiny
anteater
echidna
of
australia
and
tasmania
with
one
representative
of
the
latter
in
new
guinea
which
seems
to
have
been
still
connected
are
survivors
of
the
first
animals
to
suckle
their
young
like
the
reptiles
they
lay
eggs
and
have
a
single
outlet
for
the
excreta
and
they
have
a
reptilian
arrangement
of
the
bones
of
the
like
the
mammals
they
have
a
coat
of
hair
and
a
heart
and
they
suckle
the
young
even
in
their
mammalian
features
they
are
as
the
careful
research
of
australian
zoologists
has
shown
of
a
transitional
type
they
are
but
their
temperature
is
much
lower
than
that
of
other
mammals
and
varies
appreciably
with
the
temperature
of
their
surroundings
their
apparatus
for
suckling
the
young
is
primitive
there
are
no
teats
and
the
milk
is
forced
by
the
mother
through
simple
channels
upon
the
breast
from
which
it
is
licked
by
the
young
the
anteater
develops
her
eggs
in
a
pouch
they
illustrate
a
very
early
stage
in
the
development
of
a
mammal
from
a
reptile
and
one
is
almost
tempted
to
see
in
their
timorous
burrowing
habits
a
reminiscence
of
the
impotence
of
the
early
mammals
after
their
premature
appearance
in
the
triassic

the

that
it
attains
in

from

suffice
to
explain
their
position
in
the
story
of
evolution
among
the
reptiles
the
task
of
the
mother
ends
as
a
rule
with
the
laying
of
the
egg
one
or
two
modern
reptiles
hatch
the
eggs
or
show
some
concern
for
them
but
the
characteristic
of
the
reptile
is
to
discharge
its
eggs
upon
the
warm
earth
and
trouble
no
further
about
its
young
it
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
warm
primitive
earth
the
bird
and
mammal
born
of
the
cooling
of
the
earth
exhibit
the
beginning
of
that
link
between
mother
and
offspring
which
will
prove
so
important
an
element
in
the
higher
and
later
life
of
the
globe
the
bird
assists
the
development
of
the
eggs
with
the
heat
of
her
own
body
and
feeds
the
young
the
mammal
develops
the
young
within
the
body
and
then
feeds
them
at
the
breast
but
there
is
a
gradual
advance
in
this
process
the
duckbill
lays
its
eggs
just
like
the
reptile
but
provides
a
warm
nest
for
them
at
the
bottom
of
its
burrow
the
anteater
develops
a
temporary
pouch
in
its
body
when
it
lays
an
egg
and
hatches
the
egg
in
it
the
marsupial
retains
the
egg
in
its
womb
until
the
young
is
advanced
in
development
then
transfers
the
young
to
the
pouch
and
forces
milk
into
its
mouth
from
its
breasts
the
real
reason
for
this
is
that
the
marsupial
falls
far
short
of
the
higher
mammals
in
the
structure
of
the
womb
and
can
not
fully
develop
its
young
therein
it
has
no
placenta
or
arrangement
by
which
the
of
the
mother
are
brought
into
connection
with
the
of
the
foetus
in
order
to
supply
it
with
food
until
it
is
fully
developed
the
marsupial
in
fact
only
rises
above
the
reptile
in
hatching
the
egg
within
its
own
body
and
then
suckling
the
young
at
the
breast
these
primitive
mammals
help
us
to
reconstruct
the
mammal
life
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
the
bones
that
we
have
are
variously
described
in
geological
manuals
as
the
remains
of
monotremes
marsupials
and
insectivores
many
of
them
if
not
most
were
no
doubt
animals
but
there
is
no
ground
for
supposing
that
what
are
technically
known
as
insectivores
moles
and
shrews
existed
in
the
mesozoic
on
the
other
hand
the
lower
jaw
of
the
marsupial
is
characterised
by
a
peculiar
hooklike
process
and
this
is
commonly
found
in
mesozoic
jaws
this
circumstance
and
the
witness
of
australia
permit
us
perhaps
to
regard
the
jurassic
mammals
as
predominantly
marsupial
it
is
more
difficult
to
identify
monotreme
remains
but
the
fact
that
monotremes
have
survived
to
this
day
in
australia
and
the
resemblance
of
some
of
the
mesozoic
teeth
to
those
found
for
a
time
in
the
young
duckbill
justify
us
in
assuming
that
a
part
of
the
mesozoic
mammals
correspond
to
the
modern
monotremes
not
single
specimen
of
any
higher
or
placental
mammal
has
yet
been
found
in
the
whole
mesozoic
era
we
must
however
beware
of
simply
transferring
to
the
mesozoic
world
the
kinds
of
monotremes
and
marsupials
which
we
know
in
nature
in
some
of
the
excellent
restorations
of
mesozoic
life
which
are
found
in
recent
illustrated
literature
the
early
mammal
is
represented
with
an
external
appearance
like
that
of
the
duckbill
this
is
an
error
as
the
duckbill
has
been
greatly
modified
in
its
extremities
and
by
its
aquatic
and
burrowing
habits
as
we
have
no
complete
skeletons
of
these
early
mammals
we
must
abstain
from
picturing
their
external
appearance
it
is
enough
that
the
living
monotreme
and
marsupial
so
finely
illustrate
the
transition
from
a
reptilian
to
a
mammalian
form
there
may
have
been
types
more
primitive
than
the
duckbill
and
others
between
the
duckbill
and
the
marsupial
it
seems
clear
at
least
that
two
main
branches
the
monotremes
and
marsupials
arose
from
the
primitive
mammalian
root
whether
either
of
these
became
in
turn
the
parent
of
the
higher
mammals
we
will
inquire
later
we
must
first
consider
the
fresh
series
of
terrestrial
disturbances
which
like
some
gigantic
sieve
weeded
out
the
grosser
types
of
organisms
and
cleared
the
earth
for
a
rapid
and
remarkable
expansion
of
these
primitive
birds
and
mammals
we
have
attended
only
to
a
few
prominent
characters
in
tracing
the
line
of
evolution
but
it
will
be
understood
that
an
advance
in
many
organs
of
the
body
is
implied
in
these
changes
in
the
lower
mammals
the
diaphragm
or
complete
partition
between
the
organs
of
the
breast
and
those
of
the
abdomen
is
developed
it
is
not
a
sudden
and
mysterious
growth
and
its
development
in
the
embryo
corresponds
to
the
suggestion
of
its
development
which
the
zoologist
gathers
from
the
animal
series
the
ear
also
is
now
fully
developed
how
far
the
fish
has
a
sense
of
hearing
is
not
yet
fully
determined
but
the
amphibian
certainly
has
an
organ
for
the
perception
of
waves
of
sound
parts
of
the
discarded
are
gradually
transformed
into
the
three
bones
of
the
mammal
internal
ear
just
as
other
parts
are
converted
into
mouth
cartilages
and
as
it
is
believed
one
of
the
gill
clefts
is
converted
into
the
eustachian
tube
in
the
monotreme
and
marsupial
the
begins
to
be
covered
with
a
shell
of
cartilage
we
have
the
beginning
of
the
external
ear
the
jaws
which
are
first
developed
in
the
fish
now
articulate
more
perfectly
with
the
skull
appear
in
the
skin
and
it
is
probably
from
a
group
of
these
that
the
are
developed
the
origin
of
the
hairs
is
somewhat
obscure
they
are
not
thought
to
be
like
the
bird
feathers
modifications
of
the
reptile
scales
but
to
have
been
evolved
from
other
structures
in
the
skin
possibly
under
the
protection
of
the
scales
my
purpose
is
however
rather
to
indicate
the
general
causes
of
the
onward
advance
of
life
than
to
study
organs
in
detail
a
vast
subject
or
construct
pedigrees
we
therefore
pass
on
to
consider
the
next
great
stride
that
is
taken
by
the
advancing
life
of
the
earth
millions
of
years
of
genial
climate
and
rich
vegetation
have
filled
the
earth
with
a
prolific
and
enormously
varied
population
over
this
population
the
hand
of
natural
selection
is
outstretched
as
it
were
and
we
are
about
to
witness
another
gigantic
removal
of
older
types
of
life
and
promotion
of
those
which
contain
the
germs
of
further
advance
as
we
have
already
explained
natural
selection
is
by
no
means
inactive
during
these
intervening
periods
of
warmth
we
have
seen
the
ammonites
and
reptiles
and
even
the
birds
and
mammals
evolve
into
hundreds
of
species
during
the
jurassic
period
the
constant
evolution
of
more
effective
types
of
carnivores
and
their
spread
into
new
regions
the
continuous
changes
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
the
struggle
for
food
in
a
growing
population
and
a
dozen
other
causes
are
ever
at
work
but
the
great
and
comprehensive
changes
in
the
face
of
the
earth
which
close
the
eras
of
the
geologist
seem
to
give
a
deeper
and
quicker
stimulus
to
its
population
and
result
in
periods
of
especially
rapid
evolution
such
a
change
now
closes
the
mesozoic
era
and
inaugurates
the
age
of
flowering
plants
of
birds
and
of
mammals
chapter
xiv
in
the
days
of
the
chalk
in
accordance
with
the
view
of
the
later
story
of
the
earth
which
was
expressed
on
an
earlier
page
we
now
come
to
the
second
of
the
three
great
revolutions
which
have
quickened
the
pulse
of
life
on
the
earth
many
men
of
science
resent
the
use
of
the
word
revolution
and
it
is
not
without
some
danger
it
was
once
thought
that
the
earth
was
really
shaken
at
times
by
vast
and
sudden
cataclysms
which
destroyed
its
entire
living
population
so
that
new
kingdoms
of
plants
and
animals
had
to
be
created
but
we
have
interpreted
the
word
revolution
in
a
very
different
sense
the
series
of
changes
and
disturbances
to
which
we
give
the
name
extended
over
a
period
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
and
they
were
themselves
in
some
sense
the
creators
of
new
types
of
organisms
yet
they
are
periods
that
stand
out
peculiarly
in
the
comparatively
even
chronicle
of
the
earth
the
permian
period
transformed
the
face
of
the
earth
it
lifted
the
land
into
a
massive
relief
drew
mantles
of
ice
over
millions
of
miles
of
its
surface
set
volcanoes
belching
out
fire
and
fumes
in
many
parts
stripped
it
of
its
great
forests
and
slew
the
overwhelming
majority
of
its
animals
on
the
scale
of
geological
time
it
may
be
called
a
revolution
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
series
of
disturbances
which
close
the
secondary
and
inaugurate
the
tertiary
era
can
not
so
conveniently
be
summed
up
in
a
single
formula
they
begin
long
before
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
and
they
continue
far
into
the
tertiary
with
intervals
of
ease
and
tranquillity
there
seems
to
have
been
no
culminating
point
in
the
series
when
the
uplifted
earth
shivered
in
a
mantle
of
ice
and
snow
yet
i
propose
to
retain
for
this
period
beginning
early
in
the
cretaceous
chalk
period
and
extending
into
the
tertiary
the
name
of
the
cretaceous
revolution
i
drew
a
fanciful
parallel
between
the
three
revolutions
which
have
quickened
the
earth
since
the
sluggish
days
of
the
and
the
three
revolutionary
movements
which
have
changed
the
life
of
modern
europe
it
will
be
remembered
that
whereas
the
first
of
these
european
revolutions
was
a
sharp
and
massive
upheaval
the
second
consisted
in
a
more
scattered
and
irregular
series
of
disturbances
spread
over
the
fourth
and
fifth
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
they
amounted
in
effect
to
a
revolution
so
it
is
with
the
cretaceous
revolution
in
effect
it
corresponds
very
closely
to
the
permian
revolution
on
the
physical
side
it
includes
a
very
considerable
rise
of
the
land
over
the
greater
part
of
the
globe
and
the
formation
of
lofty
chains
of
mountains
on
the
botanical
side
it
means
the
reduction
of
the
rich
mesozoic
flora
to
a
relatively
insignificant
population
and
the
appearance
and
triumphant
spread
of
the
flowering
plants
on
the
zoological
side
it
witnesses
the
complete
extinction
of
the
ammonites
deinosaurs
and
pterosaurs
an
immense
reduction
of
the
reptile
world
generally
and
a
victorious
expansion
of
the
higher
insects
birds
and
mammals
on
the
climatic
side
it
provides
the
first
definite
evidence
of
cold
zones
of
the
earth
and
cold
seasons
of
the
year
and
seems
to
represent
a
long
if
irregular
period
of
comparative
cold
except
to
some
extent
the
last
of
these
points
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
and
therefore
from
the
evolutionary
point
of
view
the
cretaceous
period
merits
the
title
of
a
revolution
all
these
things
were
done
before
the
tertiary
period
opened
let
us
first
consider
the
fundamental
and
physical
aspect
of
this
revolution
the
upheaval
of
the
land
it
began
about
the
close
of
the
jurassic
period
western
and
central
europe
emerged
considerably
from
the
warm
jurassic
sea
which
lay
on
it
and
had
converted
it
into
an
archipelago
in
america
also
there
was
an
emergence
of
large
areas
of
land
and
the
sierra
and
cascade
ranges
of
mountains
were
formed
about
the
same
time
for
reasons
which
will
appear
later
we
must
note
carefully
this
rise
of
land
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
cretaceous
period
however
the
sea
recovered
its
lost
territory
or
compensation
for
it
and
the
middle
of
the
cretaceous
period
witnessed
a
very
considerable
extension
of
the
waters
over
america
europe
and
southern
asia
the
thick
familiar
beds
of
chalk
which
stretch
irregularly
from
ireland
to
the
crimea
and
from
the
south
of
sweden
to
the
south
of
france
plainly
tell
of
an
overlying
sea
as
is
well
known
the
chalk
consists
mainly
of
the
shells
or
outer
frames
of
minute
creatures
thalamophores
which
float
in
the
ocean
and
form
a
deep
ooze
at
its
bottom
with
their
discarded
skeletons
what
depth
this
ocean
must
have
been
is
disputed
and
hardly
concerns
us
it
is
clear
that
it
must
have
taken
an
enormous
period
for
microscopic
shells
to
form
the
thick
masses
of
chalk
which
cover
so
much
of
southern
and
eastern
england
on
the
lowest
estimates
the
cretaceous
period
which
includes
the
deposit
of
other
strata
besides
chalk
lasted
about
three
million
years
and
as
people
like
to
have
some
idea
of
the
time
since
these
things
happened
i
may
add
that
on
the
lowest
estimate
which
most
geologists
would
at
least
double
it
is
about
three
million
years
since
the
last
stretches
of
the
disappeared
from
the
surface
of
europe
but
while
our
chalk
cliffs
conjure
up
a
vision
of
england
lying
deep
at
least
twenty
or
thirty
fathoms
deep
below
a
warm
ocean
in
which
gigantic
ammonites
and
belemnites
and
sharks
ply
their
deadly
trade
they
also
remind
us
of
the
last
phase
of
the
remarkable
life
of
the
earth
middle
ages
in
the
latter
part
of
the
cretaceous
the
land
rises
the
chalk
ocean
of
europe
is
gradually
reduced
to
a
series
of
inland
seas
separated
by
masses
and
ridges
of
land
and
finally
to
a
series
of
lakes
of
brackish
water
the
masses
of
the
pyrenees
and
alps
begin
to
rise
though
it
will
not
be
until
a
much
later
date
that
they
reach
anything
like
their
present
elevation
in
america
the
change
is
even
greater
a
vast
ridge
rises
along
the
whole
western
front
of
the
continent
lifting
and
draining
it
from
alaska
to
cape
horn
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
andes
even
during
the
cretaceous
period
there
had
been
rich
forests
of
mesozoic
vegetation
covering
about
a
hundred
thousand
square
miles
in
the
rocky
mountains
region
europe
and
america
now
begin
to
show
their
modern
contours
it
is
important
to
notice
that
this
great
uprise
of
the
land
and
the
series
of
disturbances
it
entails
differ
from
those
which
we
summed
up
in
the
phrase
permian
revolution
the
differences
may
help
us
to
understand
some
of
the
changes
in
the
living
population
the
chief
difference
is
that
the
disturbances
are
more
local
and
not
nearly
simultaneous
there
is
a
considerable
emergence
of
land
at
the
end
of
the
jurassic
then
a
fresh
expansion
of
the
sea
then
a
great
rise
of
mountains
at
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
and
so
on
we
shall
find
our
great
the
pyrenees
alps
himalaya
etc
rising
at
intervals
throughout
the
whole
of
the
tertiary
era
however
it
suffices
for
the
moment
to
observe
that
in
the
latter
part
of
the
mesozoic
and
early
part
of
the
tertiary
there
were
considerable
upheavals
of
the
land
in
various
regions
and
that
the
mesozoic
era
closed
with
a
very
much
larger
proportion
of
dry
land
and
a
much
higher
relief
of
the
land
than
there
had
been
during
the
jurassic
period
the
series
of
disturbances
was
says
professor
chamberlin
greater
than
any
that
had
occurred
since
the
close
of
the
palaeozoic
from
the
previous
effect
of
the
permian
upheaval
and
from
the
fact
that
the
living
population
is
now
similarly
annihilated
or
reduced
we
should
at
once
expect
to
find
a
fresh
change
in
the
climate
of
the
earth
here
however
our
procedure
is
not
so
easy
in
the
permian
age
we
had
solid
proof
in
the
shape
of
vast
glaciated
regions
it
is
claimed
by
continental
geologists
that
certain
early
tertiary
beds
in
bavaria
actually
prove
a
similar
but
smaller
glaciation
in
europe
but
this
is
disputed
other
beds
may
yet
be
found
but
we
saw
that
there
was
not
a
general
upheaval
as
there
had
been
in
the
permian
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
there
were
few
or
no
we
do
not
in
fact
know
the
causes
of
the
permian
icefields
we
are
thrown
upon
the
plant
and
animal
remains
and
seem
to
be
in
some
danger
of
inferring
a
cold
climate
from
the
organic
remains
and
then
explaining
the
new
types
of
organisms
by
the
cold
climate
this
of
course
we
shall
not
do
the
difficulty
is
made
greater
by
the
extreme
disinclination
of
many
recent
geologists
and
some
recent
botanists
who
have
too
easily
followed
the
geologists
to
admit
a
plain
climatic
interpretation
of
the
facts
let
us
first
see
what
the
facts
are
in
the
latter
part
of
the
jurassic
we
find
three
different
zones
of
ammonites
one
in
the
latitude
of
the
mediterranean
one
in
the
latitude
of
central
europe
and
one
further
north
most
geologists
conclude
that
these
differences
indicate
zones
of
climate
not
hitherto
indicated
but
it
can
not
be
proved
and
we
may
leave
the
matter
open
at
the
same
time
the
corals
disappear
from
europe
with
occasional
advances
it
is
said
that
they
are
driven
out
by
the
disturbance
of
the
waters
and
although
this
would
hardly
explain
why
they
did
not
spread
again
in
the
tranquil
we
may
again
leave
the
point
open
in
the
early
part
of
the
cretaceous
however
the
angiosperms
flowering
plants
suddenly
break
into
the
chronicle
of
the
earth
and
spread
with
great
rapidity
they
appear
abruptly
in
the
east
of
the
north
american
continent
in
the
region
of
virginia
and
maryland
they
are
small
in
stature
and
primitive
in
structure
some
are
of
generalised
forms
that
are
now
unknown
some
have
leaves
approaching
those
of
the
oak
willow
elm
maple
and
walnut
some
may
be
definitely
described
as
fig
sassafras
aralia
myrica
etc
eastern
america
it
may
be
recalled
is
much
higher
than
western
until
the
close
of
the
cretaceous
period
the
angiosperms
do
not
spread
much
westward
they
appear
next
in
greenland
and
before
the
middle
of
the
cretaceous
in
portugal
they
have
travelled
over
the
north
atlantic
continent
or
what
remains
of
it
the
process
seems
very
rapid
as
we
write
it
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
first
half
of
the
cretaceous
period
means
a
million
or
a
million
and
a
half
years
the
cycads
and
even
the
conifers
shrink
before
the
higher
type
of
tree
the
landscape
in
europe
and
america
begins
to
wear
a
modern
aspect
long
before
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
most
of
the
modern
genera
of
angiosperm
trees
have
developed
to
the
fig
and
sassafras
are
now
added
the
birch
beech
oak
poplar
walnut
willow
ivy
mulberry
holly
laurel
myrtle
maple
oleander
magnolia
plane
and
most
of
the
american
trees
of
are
known
the
sequoias
the
giant
californian
trees
still
represent
the
conifers
in
great
abundance
with
the
eucalyptus
and
other
plants
that
are
now
found
only
much
further
south
the
ginkgoes
struggle
on
for
a
time
the
cycads
dwindle
enormously
of
specimens
in
one
early
cretaceous
deposit
only
are
angiosperms
of
species
in
a
later
deposit
about
are
angiosperms
they
oust
the
cycads
in
europe
and
america
as
the
cycads
and
conifers
had
ousted
the
cryptogams
the
change
in
the
face
of
the
earth
would
be
remarkable
instead
of
the
groves
of
cycads
with
their
large
and
fructifications
above
which
the
pines
and
firs
and
cypresses
reared
their
sombre
forms
there
were
now
forests
of
maples
beeches
and
oaks
bearing
nutritious
fruit
for
the
coming
race
of
animals
grasses
also
and
palms
begin
in
the
cretaceous
though
the
grasses
would
at
first
be
coarse
and
isolated
tufts
even
flowers
of
the
lily
family
apparently
are
still
detected
in
the
crushed
and
petrified
remains
we
will
give
some
consideration
later
to
the
evolution
of
the
angiosperms
for
the
moment
it
is
chiefly
important
to
notice
a
feature
of
them
to
which
the
botanist
pays
less
attention
in
his
technical
view
the
angiosperm
is
distinguished
by
the
structure
of
its
reproductive
apparatus
its
flowers
and
some
recent
botanists
wonder
whether
the
key
to
this
expansion
of
the
flowering
plants
may
not
be
found
in
a
development
of
the
insect
world
and
of
its
relation
to
vegetation
in
point
of
fact
we
have
no
geological
indication
of
any
great
development
of
the
insects
until
the
tertiary
era
when
we
shall
find
them
deploying
into
a
vast
army
and
producing
their
highest
types
in
any
case
such
a
view
leaves
wholly
unexplained
the
feature
of
the
angiosperms
which
chiefly
concerns
us
this
is
that
most
of
them
shed
the
whole
of
their
leaves
periodically
as
the
winter
approaches
no
such
trees
had
yet
been
known
on
the
earth
all
trees
hitherto
had
been
evergreen
and
we
need
a
specific
and
adequate
explanation
why
the
earth
is
now
covered
in
the
northern
region
with
forests
of
trees
which
show
naked
boughs
and
branches
during
a
part
of
the
year
the
majority
of
palaeontologists
conclude
at
once
and
quite
confidently
from
this
rise
and
spread
of
the
deciduous
trees
that
a
winter
season
has
at
length
set
in
on
the
earth
and
that
this
new
type
of
vegetation
appears
in
response
to
an
appreciable
lowering
of
the
climate
the
facts
however
are
somewhat
complex
and
we
must
proceed
with
caution
it
would
seem
that
any
general
lowering
of
the
temperature
of
the
earth
ought
to
betray
itself
first
in
greenland
but
the
flora
of
greenland
remains
far
warmer
so
to
say
than
the
flora
of
central
europe
is
even
toward
the
close
of
the
cretaceous
its
plants
are
much
the
same
as
those
of
america
or
of
central
europe
its
fossil
remains
of
that
time
include
forty
species
of
ferns
as
well
as
cycads
ginkgoes
figs
bamboos
and
magnolias
sir
geikie
ventures
to
say
that
it
must
then
have
enjoyed
a
climate
like
that
of
the
cape
or
of
australia
professor
chamberlin
finds
its
flora
like
that
of
warm
temperate
regions
and
says
that
plants
which
then
flourished
in
latitude
degrees
are
not
now
found
above
latitude
degrees
there
are
however
various
reasons
to
believe
that
it
is
unsafe
to
draw
deductions
from
the
climate
of
greenland
there
is
it
is
true
some
exaggeration
in
the
statement
that
its
climate
was
equivalent
to
that
of
central
europe
the
palms
which
flourished
in
central
europe
did
not
reach
greenland
and
there
are
differences
in
the
northern
molluscs
and
echinoderms
which
like
the
absence
of
corals
above
the
north
of
england
point
to
a
diversity
of
temperature
but
we
have
no
right
to
expect
that
there
would
be
the
same
difference
in
temperature
between
greenland
and
central
europe
as
we
find
if
the
warm
current
which
is
now
diverted
to
europe
across
the
atlantic
the
gulf
stream
had
then
continued
up
the
coast
of
america
and
flowed
along
the
coast
of
the
land
that
united
america
and
europe
the
climatic
conditions
would
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
there
is
a
more
substantial
reason
we
saw
that
during
the
mesozoic
the
arctic
continent
was
very
largely
submerged
and
while
europe
and
america
rise
again
at
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
we
find
no
rise
of
the
land
further
north
a
difference
of
elevation
would
in
such
a
world
make
a
great
difference
in
temperature
and
moisture
let
us
examine
the
animal
record
however
before
we
come
to
any
conclusion
the
chronicle
of
the
later
cretaceous
is
a
story
of
devastation
the
reduction
of
the
cyeads
is
insignificant
beside
the
reduction
or
annihilation
of
the
great
animals
of
the
mesozoic
world
the
skeletons
of
the
deinosaurs
become
fewer
and
fewer
as
we
ascend
the
upper
cretaceous
strata
in
the
uppermost
layer
laramie
we
find
traces
of
a
last
curious
expansion
the
group
of
horned
reptiles
of
the
triceratops
type
which
we
described
as
the
last
of
the
great
reptiles
the
ichthyosaurs
and
plesiosaurs
vanish
from
the
waters
the
mososaurs
pass
away
without
a
survivor
the
flying
dragons
large
and
small
become
entirely
extinct
only
crocodiles
lizards
turtle
and
snakes
cross
the
threshold
of
the
tertiary
era
in
one
single
region
of
america
puerco
beds
some
of
the
great
reptiles
seem
to
be
making
a
last
stand
against
the
advancing
enemy
in
the
dawn
of
the
tertiary
era
but
the
exact
date
of
the
beds
is
disputed
and
in
any
case
their
fight
is
soon
over
something
has
slain
the
most
formidable
race
that
the
earth
had
yet
known
in
spite
of
its
marvellous
adaptation
to
different
environments
in
its
innumerable
branches
we
turn
to
the
seas
and
find
an
equal
carnage
among
some
of
its
most
advanced
inhabitants
the
great
belemnites
and
the
whole
race
of
the
ammonites
large
and
small
are
banished
from
the
earth
the
fall
of
the
ammonites
is
particularly
interesting
and
has
inspired
much
more
or
less
fantastic
speculation
the
shells
begin
to
assume
such
strange
forms
that
observers
speak
occasionally
of
the
convulsions
or
of
the
expiring
race
some
of
the
coiled
shells
take
on
a
spiral
form
like
that
of
a
snail
shell
some
uncoil
the
shell
and
seem
to
be
returning
toward
the
primitive
type
a
rich
eccentricity
of
frills
and
ornamentation
is
found
more
or
less
throughout
the
whole
race
but
every
device
if
we
may
so
regard
these
changes
is
useless
and
the
devastating
agency
of
the
cretaceous
whatever
it
was
removes
the
ammonites
and
belemnites
from
the
scene
the
mollusc
world
like
the
world
of
plants
and
of
reptiles
approaches
its
modern
aspect
in
the
fish
world
too
there
is
an
effective
selection
in
the
course
of
the
cretaceous
all
the
fishes
of
modern
times
except
the
large
family
of
the
sharks
rays
skates
and
elasmobranchs
the
sturgeon
and
chimaera
the
and
a
very
few
other
types
are
teleosts
or
fishes
the
others
having
cartilaginous
frames
none
of
the
teleosts
had
appeared
until
the
end
of
the
jurassic
they
now
like
the
flowering
plants
on
land
not
only
herald
the
new
age
but
rapidly
oust
the
other
fishes
except
the
unconquerable
shark
they
gradually
approach
the
familiar
types
of
teleosts
so
that
we
may
say
that
before
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
the
waters
swarmed
with
primitive
and
patriarchal
cod
salmon
herring
perch
pike
bream
eels
and
other
fishes
some
of
them
grew
to
an
enormous
size
the
portheus
an
american
pike
seems
to
have
been
about
eight
feet
long
and
the
activity
of
an
pike
may
be
left
to
the
angler
imagination
all
however
are
as
evolution
demands
of
a
generalised
and
unfamiliar
type
the
material
out
of
which
our
fishes
will
be
evolved
of
the
insects
we
have
very
little
trace
in
the
cretaceous
we
shall
find
them
developing
with
great
richness
in
the
following
period
but
imperfect
as
the
record
is
we
may
venture
to
say
that
they
were
checked
in
the
cretaceous
there
were
good
conditions
for
preserving
them
but
few
are
preserved
and
of
the
other
groups
of
invertebrates
we
need
only
say
that
they
show
a
steady
advance
toward
modern
types
the
fills
the
rocks
no
longer
the
is
very
abundant
the
molluscs
gain
on
the
more
lowly
organised
brachiopods
to
complete
the
picture
we
must
add
that
higher
types
probably
arose
in
the
later
cretaceous
which
do
not
appear
in
the
records
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
birds
and
mammals
we
find
them
spreading
so
early
in
the
tertiary
that
we
must
put
back
the
beginning
of
the
expansion
to
the
cretaceous
as
yet
however
the
only
mammal
remains
we
find
are
such
jaws
and
teeth
of
primitive
mammals
as
we
have
already
described
the
birds
we
described
after
the
archaeopteryx
also
belong
to
the
cretaceous
and
they
form
another
of
the
doomed
races
probably
the
modern
birds
were
already
developing
among
the
new
vegetation
on
the
higher
ground
these
are
the
facts
of
cretaceous
life
as
far
as
the
record
has
yielded
them
and
it
remains
for
us
to
understand
them
clearly
there
has
been
a
great
selective
process
analogous
to
if
not
equal
to
the
winnowing
process
at
the
end
of
the
palaeozoic
as
there
has
been
a
similar
if
less
considerable
upheaval
of
the
land
we
are
at
once
tempted
to
think
that
the
great
selective
agency
was
a
lowering
of
the
temperature
when
we
further
find
that
the
most
important
change
in
the
animal
world
is
the
destruction
of
the
reptiles
which
have
no
concern
for
the
young
and
the
luxuriant
spread
of
the
animals
which
do
care
for
their
young
the
idea
is
greatly
confirmed
when
we
add
that
the
powerful
molluscs
which
are
slain
while
the
humbler
molluscs
survive
are
those
which
to
judge
from
the
nautilus
and
octopus
love
warm
seas
the
impression
is
further
confirmed
and
when
we
finally
reflect
that
the
most
distinctive
phenomenon
of
the
period
is
the
rapid
spread
of
deciduous
trees
it
would
seem
that
there
is
only
one
possible
interpretation
of
the
cretaceous
revolution
this
interpretation
that
cold
was
the
selecting
agency
is
a
familiar
idea
in
geological
literature
but
as
i
said
there
are
recent
writers
who
profess
reserve
in
regard
to
it
and
it
is
proper
to
glance
at
or
at
least
look
for
the
alternatives
before
doing
so
let
us
be
quite
clear
that
here
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
theories
of
the
origin
of
the
earth
the
permian
cold
which
however
is
universally
admitted
is
more
or
less
entangled
in
that
controversy
the
cretaceous
cold
has
no
connection
with
it
whatever
excess
of
there
may
have
been
in
the
early
atmosphere
was
cleared
by
the
we
must
set
aside
all
these
theories
in
explaining
the
present
facts
it
is
also
useful
to
note
that
the
fact
that
there
have
been
great
changes
in
the
climate
of
the
earth
in
past
time
is
beyond
dispute
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
that
the
climate
of
the
earth
was
warm
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
in
the
devonian
and
carboniferous
periods
that
it
fell
considerably
in
the
permian
that
it
again
became
at
least
warm
temperate
chamberlin
from
the
arctic
to
the
antarctic
in
the
jurassic
and
again
in
the
eocene
that
some
millions
of
square
miles
of
europe
and
north
america
were
covered
with
ice
and
snow
in
the
pleistocene
so
that
the
reindeer
wandered
where
palms
had
previously
flourished
and
the
vine
flourishes
and
that
the
pronounced
zones
of
climate
which
we
find
today
have
no
counterpart
in
any
earlier
age
in
view
of
these
great
and
admitted
fluctuations
of
the
temperature
one
does
not
see
any
reason
for
hesitating
to
admit
a
fall
of
temperature
in
the
cretaceous
if
the
facts
point
to
it
on
the
other
hand
the
alternative
suggestions
are
not
very
convincing
we
have
noticed
one
of
these
suggestions
in
connection
with
the
origin
of
the
angiosperms
it
hints
that
this
may
be
related
to
developments
of
the
insect
world
most
probably
the
development
of
the
characteristic
flowers
of
the
angiosperms
is
connected
with
an
increasing
relation
to
insects
but
what
we
want
to
understand
especially
is
the
deciduous
character
of
their
leaves
many
of
the
angiosperms
are
evergreen
so
that
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
one
change
entailed
the
other
in
fact
a
careful
study
of
the
leaves
preserved
in
the
rocks
seems
to
show
the
deciduous
angiosperms
gaining
on
the
evergreens
at
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
the
most
natural
it
not
the
only
interpretation
of
this
is
that
the
temperature
is
falling
deciduous
trees
shed
their
leaves
so
as
to
check
their
transpiration
when
a
season
comes
on
in
which
they
can
not
absorb
the
normal
amount
of
moisture
this
may
occur
either
at
the
of
a
hot
dry
season
or
of
a
cold
season
in
which
the
roots
absorb
less
everything
suggests
that
the
deciduous
tree
evolved
to
meet
an
increase
of
cold
not
of
heat
another
suggestion
is
that
animals
and
plants
were
not
climatically
differentiated
until
the
cretaceous
period
that
is
to
say
that
they
were
adapted
to
all
climates
before
that
time
and
then
began
to
be
sensitive
to
differences
of
climate
and
live
in
different
latitudes
but
how
and
why
they
should
suddenly
become
differentiated
in
this
way
is
so
mysterious
that
one
prefers
to
think
that
as
the
animal
remains
also
suggest
there
were
no
appreciable
zones
of
climate
until
the
cretaceous
the
magnolia
for
instance
flourished
in
greenland
in
the
early
tertiary
and
has
to
live
very
far
south
of
it
it
is
much
simpler
to
assume
that
greenland
changed
as
a
vast
amount
of
evidence
indicates
than
that
the
magnolia
changed
finally
to
explain
the
disappearance
of
the
mesozoic
reptiles
without
a
fall
in
temperature
it
is
suggested
that
they
were
exterminated
by
the
advancing
mammals
it
is
assumed
that
the
spreading
world
of
the
angiospermous
plants
somewhere
met
the
spread
of
the
advancing
mammals
and
opened
out
a
rich
new
granary
to
them
this
led
to
so
powerful
a
development
of
the
mammals
that
they
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
reptiles
there
are
several
serious
difficulties
in
the
way
of
this
theory
the
first
and
most
decisive
is
that
the
great
reptiles
have
practically
disappeared
before
the
mammals
come
on
the
scene
only
in
one
series
of
beds
puerco
in
america
representing
an
early
period
of
the
tertiary
era
do
we
find
any
association
of
their
remains
and
even
there
it
is
not
clear
that
they
were
contemporary
over
the
earth
generally
the
geological
record
shows
the
great
reptiles
dying
from
some
invisible
scourge
long
before
any
mammal
capable
of
doing
them
any
harm
appears
even
if
we
suppose
that
the
mammal
mainly
attacked
the
eggs
and
the
young
we
may
very
well
believe
that
more
powerful
mammals
than
the
primitive
mesozoic
specimens
were
already
developed
in
some
part
of
the
earth
say
africa
and
that
the
rise
of
the
land
gave
them
a
bridge
across
the
mediterranean
to
europe
probably
this
happened
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
reptiles
were
already
almost
extinct
the
difficulty
is
even
greater
when
we
reflect
that
it
is
precisely
the
most
powerful
reptiles
deinosaurs
and
least
accessible
reptiles
pterosaurs
ichthyosaurs
etc
which
disappear
while
the
smaller
land
and
water
reptiles
survive
and
retreat
southward
where
the
mammals
are
just
as
numerous
that
assuredly
is
not
the
effect
of
an
invasion
of
carnivores
even
if
we
could
overlook
the
absence
of
such
carnivores
from
the
record
until
after
the
extinction
of
the
reptiles
in
most
places
i
have
entered
somewhat
fully
into
this
point
partly
because
of
its
great
interest
but
partly
lest
it
be
thought
that
i
am
merely
reproducing
a
tradition
of
geological
literature
without
giving
due
attention
to
the
criticisms
of
recent
writers
the
plain
and
common
interpretation
of
the
cretaceous
revolution
that
a
fall
in
temperature
was
its
chief
devastating
agency
is
the
only
one
that
brings
harmony
into
all
the
facts
the
one
comprehensive
enemy
of
that
vast
reptile
population
was
cold
it
was
fatal
to
the
adult
because
he
had
a
heart
and
no
warm
coat
it
was
fatal
to
the
mesozoic
vegetation
on
which
directly
or
indirectly
he
fed
it
was
fatal
to
his
eggs
and
young
because
the
mother
did
not
brood
over
the
one
or
care
for
the
other
it
was
fatal
to
the
pterosaurs
even
if
they
were
because
they
had
no
warm
coats
and
did
not
presumably
hatch
their
eggs
and
it
was
equally
fatal
to
the
viviparous
ichthyosaurs
it
is
the
one
common
fate
that
could
slay
all
classes
when
we
find
that
the
surviving
reptiles
retreat
southward
only
lingering
in
europe
during
the
renewed
warmth
of
the
eocene
and
miocene
periods
this
interpretation
is
sufficiently
confirmed
and
when
we
recollect
that
these
things
coincide
with
the
extinction
of
the
ammonites
and
belemnites
and
the
driving
of
their
descendants
further
south
as
well
as
the
rise
and
triumph
of
deciduous
trees
it
is
difficult
to
see
any
ground
for
hesitating
but
we
need
not
and
must
not
imagine
a
period
of
cold
as
severe
prolonged
and
general
as
that
of
the
permian
period
the
warmth
of
the
jurassic
period
is
generally
attributed
to
the
low
relief
of
the
land
and
the
very
large
proportion
of
the
effect
of
this
would
be
to
increase
the
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
whether
this
was
assisted
by
any
abnormal
proportion
of
as
in
the
carboniferous
we
can
not
confidently
say
professor
chamberlin
observes
that
since
the
absorbing
was
greatly
reduced
in
the
jurassic
the
would
tend
to
accumulate
in
its
atmosphere
and
help
to
explain
the
high
temperature
but
the
great
spread
of
vegetation
and
the
rise
of
land
in
the
later
jurassic
and
the
cretaceous
would
reduce
this
density
of
the
atmosphere
and
help
to
lower
the
temperature
it
is
clear
that
the
cold
would
at
first
be
local
in
fact
it
must
be
carefully
realised
that
when
we
speak
of
the
jurassic
period
as
a
time
of
uniform
warmth
we
mean
uniform
at
the
same
altitude
everybody
knows
the
effect
of
rising
from
the
warm
moist
to
the
top
of
even
a
small
inland
elevation
there
would
be
such
cooler
regions
throughout
the
jurassic
and
we
saw
that
there
were
considerable
upheavals
of
land
towards
its
close
to
these
elevated
lands
we
may
look
for
the
development
of
the
angiosperms
the
birds
and
the
mammals
when
the
more
massive
rise
of
land
came
at
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
the
temperature
would
fall
over
larger
areas
and
connecting
ridges
would
be
established
between
one
area
and
another
the
mesozoic
plants
and
animals
would
succumb
to
this
advancing
cold
what
precise
degree
of
cold
was
necessary
to
kill
the
reptiles
and
cephalopods
yet
allow
certain
of
the
more
delicate
flowering
plants
to
live
is
yet
to
be
determined
the
vast
majority
of
the
new
plants
with
their
winter
sleep
would
thrive
in
the
cooler
air
and
occupying
the
ground
of
the
retreating
cycads
and
ginkgoes
would
prepare
a
rich
harvest
for
the
coming
birds
and
mammals
chapter
xv
the
tertiary
era
we
have
already
traversed
nearly
of
the
story
of
terrestrial
life
without
counting
the
long
and
obscure
archaean
period
and
still
find
ourselves
in
a
strange
and
unfamiliar
earth
with
the
close
of
the
chalk
period
however
we
take
a
long
stride
in
the
direction
of
the
modern
world
the
tertiary
era
will
in
the
main
prove
a
fresh
period
of
genial
warmth
and
fertile
regions
during
its
course
our
deciduous
trees
and
grasses
will
mingle
with
the
palms
and
pines
over
the
land
our
flowers
will
begin
to
brighten
the
landscape
and
the
forms
of
our
familiar
birds
and
mammals
even
the
form
of
man
will
be
discernible
in
the
crowds
of
animals
at
its
close
another
mighty
period
of
selection
will
clear
the
stage
for
its
modern
actors
a
curious
reflection
is
prompted
in
connection
with
this
division
of
the
earth
story
into
periods
of
relative
prosperity
and
quiescence
separated
by
periods
of
disturbance
there
was
on
the
most
modest
estimate
a
stretch
of
some
fifteen
million
years
between
the
cambrian
and
the
permian
upheavals
on
the
same
chronological
scale
the
interval
between
the
permian
and
cretaceous
revolutions
was
only
about
seven
million
years
and
the
tertiary
era
will
comprise
only
about
three
million
years
one
wonders
if
the
fourth
quaternary
era
in
which
we
live
will
be
similarly
shortened
further
whereas
the
earth
returned
after
each
of
the
earlier
upheavals
to
what
seems
to
have
been
its
primitive
condition
of
equable
and
warm
climate
it
has
now
entirely
departed
from
that
condition
and
exhibits
very
different
zones
of
climate
and
a
succession
of
seasons
in
the
year
one
wonders
what
the
climate
of
the
earth
will
become
long
before
the
expiration
of
those
ten
million
years
which
are
usually
assigned
as
the
minimum
period
during
which
the
globe
will
remain
habitable
it
is
premature
to
glance
at
the
future
when
we
are
still
some
millions
of
years
from
the
present
but
it
will
be
useful
to
look
more
closely
at
the
facts
which
inspire
this
reflection
from
what
we
have
seen
and
shall
further
see
it
is
clear
that
in
spite
of
all
the
recent
controversy
about
climate
among
our
geologists
there
has
undeniably
been
a
progressive
refrigeration
of
the
globe
every
geologist
indeed
admits
oscillations
of
climate
as
professor
chamberlin
puts
it
but
amidst
all
these
oscillations
we
trace
a
steady
lowering
of
the
temperature
unless
we
put
a
strained
and
somewhat
arbitrary
interpretation
on
the
facts
of
the
geological
record
earlier
ages
knew
nothing
of
our
division
of
the
year
into
pronounced
seasons
and
of
the
globe
into
very
different
climatic
zones
it
might
plausibly
be
suggested
that
we
are
still
living
in
the
last
days
of
the
and
that
the
earth
may
be
slowly
returning
to
a
warmer
condition
shackleton
it
might
be
observed
found
that
there
has
been
a
considerable
shrinkage
of
the
south
polar
ice
within
the
period
of
exploration
but
we
shall
find
that
a
difference
of
climate
as
compared
with
earlier
ages
was
already
evident
in
the
middle
of
the
tertiary
era
and
it
is
far
more
noticeable
we
do
not
know
the
causes
of
this
climatic
evolution
the
point
will
be
considered
more
closely
in
connection
with
the
last
but
we
see
that
it
throws
a
flood
of
light
on
the
evolution
of
organisms
it
is
one
of
the
chief
incarnations
of
natural
selection
changes
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
and
in
the
nature
of
the
the
coming
of
powerful
carnivores
and
other
agencies
which
we
have
seen
have
had
their
share
in
the
onward
impulsion
of
life
but
the
most
drastic
agency
seems
to
have
been
the
supervention
of
cold
the
higher
types
of
both
animals
and
plants
appear
plainly
in
response
to
a
lowering
of
temperature
this
is
the
chief
advantage
of
studying
the
story
of
evolution
in
strict
connection
with
the
geological
record
we
shall
find
that
the
record
will
continue
to
throw
light
on
our
path
to
the
end
but
as
we
are
now
about
to
approach
the
most
important
era
of
evolution
and
as
we
have
now
seen
so
much
of
the
concrete
story
of
evolution
it
will
be
interesting
to
examine
briefly
some
other
ways
of
conceiving
that
story
we
need
not
return
to
the
consideration
of
the
leading
schools
of
evolution
as
described
in
a
former
chapter
nothing
that
we
have
seen
will
enable
us
to
choose
between
the
lamarckian
and
the
weismannist
hypothesis
and
i
doubt
if
anything
we
are
yet
to
see
will
prove
more
decisive
the
dispute
is
somewhat
academic
and
not
vital
to
a
conception
of
evolution
we
shall
for
instance
presently
follow
the
evolution
of
the
horse
and
see
four
of
its
toes
shrink
and
disappear
while
the
fifth
toe
is
enormously
strengthened
in
the
facts
themselves
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
decide
whether
this
evolution
took
place
on
the
lines
suggested
by
weismann
or
on
the
lines
suggested
by
lamarck
and
accepted
by
darwin
it
will
be
enough
for
us
merely
to
establish
the
fact
that
the
horse
is
an
evolved
descendant
of
a
primitive
mammal
through
the
adaptation
of
its
foot
to
running
on
firm
ground
its
teeth
and
neck
to
feeding
on
grasses
and
so
on
on
the
other
hand
the
facts
we
have
already
seen
seem
to
justify
the
attitude
of
compromise
i
adopted
in
regard
to
the
mutationist
theory
it
would
be
an
advantage
in
many
ways
if
we
could
believe
that
new
species
arose
by
sudden
and
large
variations
mutations
of
the
young
from
the
parental
type
in
the
case
of
many
organs
and
habits
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
see
how
a
gradual
development
by
a
slow
accentuation
of
small
variations
is
possible
when
we
further
find
that
experimenters
on
living
species
can
bring
about
such
mutations
and
when
we
reflect
that
there
must
have
been
acute
disturbances
in
the
surroundings
of
animals
and
plants
sometimes
we
are
disposed
to
think
that
many
a
new
species
may
have
arisen
in
this
way
on
the
other
hand
while
the
palaeontological
record
can
never
prove
that
a
species
arose
by
mutations
it
does
sometimes
show
that
species
arise
by
very
gradual
modification
the
chalk
period
which
we
have
just
traversed
affords
a
very
clear
instance
one
of
our
chief
investigators
of
the
english
chalk
rowe
paid
particular
attention
to
the
it
contains
as
they
serve
well
to
identify
different
levels
of
chalk
he
discovered
not
merely
that
they
vary
from
level
to
level
but
that
in
at
least
one
genus
micraster
he
could
trace
the
organism
very
gradually
passing
from
one
species
to
another
without
any
leap
or
abruptness
it
is
certainly
significant
that
we
find
such
cases
as
this
precisely
where
the
conditions
of
preservation
are
exceptionally
good
we
must
conclude
that
species
arise
probably
both
by
mutations
and
small
variations
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
class
of
species
has
been
the
more
numerous
there
remain
one
or
two
conceptions
of
evolution
which
we
have
not
hitherto
noticed
as
it
was
advisable
to
see
the
facts
first
one
of
these
is
the
view
chiefly
represented
in
this
country
by
professor
henslow
that
natural
selection
has
had
no
part
in
the
creation
of
species
that
the
only
two
factors
are
the
environment
and
the
organism
which
responds
to
its
changes
this
is
true
enough
in
the
sense
that
as
we
saw
natural
selection
is
not
an
action
of
nature
on
the
fit
but
on
the
unfit
or
less
fit
but
this
does
not
in
the
least
lessen
the
importance
of
natural
selection
if
there
were
not
in
nature
this
body
of
destructive
agencies
to
which
we
apply
the
name
natural
selection
there
would
be
little
we
can
not
say
no
evolution
but
the
rising
carnivores
the
falls
of
temperature
that
we
have
studied
have
had
so
real
if
indirect
an
influence
on
the
development
of
life
that
we
need
not
dwell
on
this
another
school
or
several
schools
while
admitting
the
action
of
natural
selection
maintain
that
earlier
evolutionists
have
made
nature
much
too
red
in
tooth
and
claw
russel
wallace
from
one
motive
and
prince
krapotkin
from
another
have
insisted
that
the
triumphs
of
war
have
been
exaggerated
and
the
triumphs
of
peace
or
of
social
far
too
little
appreciated
it
will
be
found
that
such
writers
usually
base
their
theory
on
life
as
we
find
it
in
nature
where
the
social
principle
is
highly
developed
in
many
groups
of
animals
this
is
most
misleading
since
social
among
animals
as
an
instrument
of
progress
is
geologically
speaking
quite
a
recent
phenomenon
nearly
every
group
of
animals
in
which
it
is
found
belongs
to
put
it
moderately
to
the
last
tenth
of
the
story
of
life
and
in
some
of
the
chief
instances
the
animals
have
only
gradually
developed
social
life
the
first
of
the
chronicle
of
evolution
contain
no
indication
of
social
life
except
curiously
enough
in
such
groups
as
the
sponges
corals
and
bryozoa
which
are
amongst
the
least
progressive
in
nature
we
have
seen
plainly
that
during
the
overwhelmingly
greater
part
of
the
story
of
life
the
predominant
agencies
of
evolution
were
struggle
against
adverse
conditions
and
devouring
carnivores
and
we
shall
find
them
the
predominant
agencies
throughout
the
tertiary
era
thus
the
social
nature
of
man
is
sometimes
quoted
as
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
his
development
it
is
true
that
it
has
much
to
do
with
his
later
development
but
we
shall
see
that
the
statement
that
man
was
from
the
start
a
social
being
is
not
at
all
warranted
by
the
facts
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
the
ants
and
termites
had
appeared
in
the
mesozoic
we
shall
see
some
evidence
that
the
remarkable
division
of
labour
which
now
characterises
their
life
did
not
begin
until
a
much
later
period
so
that
we
have
no
evidence
of
social
life
in
the
early
stages
yet
we
must
protest
against
the
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
conscious
pain
which
so
many
read
into
these
millions
of
years
of
struggle
probably
there
was
no
consciousness
at
all
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
the
wriggling
of
the
worm
on
which
you
have
accidentally
trodden
is
no
proof
whatever
that
you
have
caused
conscious
pain
the
nervous
system
of
an
animal
has
been
so
evolved
as
to
respond
with
great
disturbance
of
its
tissue
to
any
dangerous
or
injurious
assault
it
is
the
selection
of
a
certain
means
of
but
at
what
level
of
life
the
animal
becomes
conscious
of
this
disturbance
and
feels
pain
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
the
subject
is
too
vast
to
be
opened
here
in
a
special
investigation
of
it
i
concluded
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
presence
of
any
degree
of
consciousness
in
the
invertebrate
world
even
in
the
higher
insects
that
there
is
probably
only
a
dull
blurred
imperfect
consciousness
below
the
level
of
the
higher
mammals
and
birds
and
that
even
the
consciousness
of
an
ape
is
something
very
different
from
what
educated
europeans
on
the
ground
of
their
own
experience
call
consciousness
it
is
too
often
forgotten
that
pain
is
in
proportion
to
consciousness
we
must
beware
of
such
fallacies
as
transferring
our
experience
of
pain
to
a
mesozoic
reptile
with
an
ounce
or
two
of
cerebrum
to
twenty
tons
of
muscle
and
bone
the
evolution
of
mind
black
one
other
view
of
evolution
which
we
find
in
some
recent
and
reputable
works
such
as
professor
geddes
and
thomson
evolution
calls
for
consideration
in
the
ordinary
darwinian
view
the
variations
of
the
young
from
their
parents
are
indefinite
and
spread
in
all
directions
they
may
continue
to
occur
for
ages
without
any
of
them
proving
an
advantage
to
their
possessors
then
the
environment
may
change
and
a
certain
variation
may
prove
an
advantage
and
be
continuously
and
increasingly
selected
thus
these
indefinite
variations
may
be
so
controlled
by
the
environment
during
millions
of
years
that
the
fish
at
last
becomes
an
elephant
or
a
man
the
alternative
view
urged
by
a
few
writers
is
that
the
variations
were
definitely
directed
the
phrase
seems
merely
to
complicate
the
story
of
evolution
with
a
fresh
and
superfluous
mystery
the
nature
and
precise
action
of
this
definite
direction
within
the
organism
are
quite
unintelligible
and
the
facts
seem
explainable
just
as
well
or
not
less
imperfectly
without
as
with
this
mystic
agency
radiolaria
sponges
corals
sharks
mudfishes
duckbills
do
not
change
except
within
the
limits
of
their
family
during
millions
of
years
because
they
keep
to
an
environment
to
which
they
are
fitted
on
the
other
hand
certain
fishes
reptiles
remain
in
a
changing
environment
and
they
must
change
with
it
the
process
has
its
obscurities
but
we
make
them
darker
it
seems
to
me
with
these
phrases
it
has
seemed
advisable
to
take
this
further
glance
at
the
general
principles
and
current
theories
of
evolution
before
we
extend
our
own
procedure
into
the
tertiary
era
the
highest
types
of
animals
and
plants
are
now
about
to
appear
on
the
stage
of
the
earth
the
theatre
itself
is
about
to
take
on
a
modern
complexion
the
middle
ages
are
over
the
new
age
is
breaking
upon
the
planet
we
will
as
before
first
survey
the
tertiary
era
as
a
whole
with
the
momentous
changes
it
introduces
and
then
examine
in
separate
chapters
the
more
important
phases
of
its
life
it
opens
like
the
preceding
and
the
following
era
with
the
area
of
land
large
and
its
relief
pronounced
this
is
the
outcome
of
the
cretaceous
revolution
southern
europe
and
southern
asia
have
risen
and
shaken
the
last
masses
of
the
chalk
ocean
from
their
faces
the
whole
western
fringe
of
america
has
similarly
emerged
from
the
sea
that
had
flooded
it
in
many
parts
as
in
england
at
that
time
a
part
of
the
continent
there
is
so
great
a
gap
between
the
latest
cretaceous
and
the
earliest
tertiary
strata
that
these
newly
elevated
lands
must
evidently
have
stood
out
of
the
waters
for
a
prolonged
period
on
their
cooler
plains
the
tragedy
of
the
extinction
of
the
great
reptiles
comes
to
an
end
the
cyeads
and
ginkgoes
have
shrunk
into
thin
survivors
of
the
luxuriant
mesozoic
groves
the
oak
and
beech
and
other
deciduous
trees
spread
slowly
over
the
successive
lands
amid
the
glare
and
thunder
of
the
numerous
volcanoes
which
the
disturbance
of
the
crust
has
brought
into
play
new
forms
of
birds
fly
from
tree
to
tree
or
linger
by
the
waters
and
strange
patriarchal
types
of
mammals
begin
to
move
among
the
bones
of
the
stricken
reptiles
but
the
seas
and
the
rains
and
rivers
are
acting
with
renewed
vigour
on
the
elevated
lands
and
the
eocene
period
closes
in
a
fresh
age
of
levelling
let
us
put
the
work
of
a
million
years
or
so
in
a
sentence
the
southern
sea
which
has
been
confined
almost
to
the
limits
of
our
mediterranean
by
the
cretaceous
upheaval
gradually
enlarges
once
more
it
floods
the
of
africa
almost
as
far
as
the
equator
it
covers
most
of
italy
turkey
austria
and
southern
russia
it
spreads
over
asia
minor
persia
and
southern
asia
until
it
joins
the
pacific
and
it
sends
a
long
arm
across
the
region
and
up
the
great
valley
which
is
now
the
german
ocean
from
earlier
chapters
we
now
expect
to
find
a
warmer
climate
and
the
record
gives
abundant
proof
of
it
to
this
period
belongs
the
london
clay
in
whose
thick
and
to
the
unskilled
eye
insignificant
bed
the
geologist
reads
the
remarkable
story
of
what
london
was
two
or
three
million
years
ago
it
tells
us
that
a
sea
some
or
feet
deep
then
lay
over
that
part
of
england
and
fragments
of
the
life
of
the
period
are
preserved
in
its
deposit
the
sea
lay
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
on
whose
banks
grew
palms
figs
ginkgoes
eucalyptuses
almonds
and
magnolias
with
the
more
familiar
oaks
and
pines
and
laurels
and
monstrous
sharks
lived
in
the
sea
large
turtles
and
crocodiles
and
enormous
lingered
in
this
last
spell
of
warmth
that
central
europe
would
experience
a
primitive
whale
appeared
in
the
seas
and
strange
large
mammals
remote
ancestors
of
our
horses
and
more
familiar
beasts
wandered
heavily
on
the
land
gigantic
primitive
birds
sometimes
ten
feet
high
waded
by
the
shore
deposits
of
the
period
at
bournemouth
and
in
the
isle
of
wight
tell
the
same
story
of
a
land
that
bore
figs
vines
palms
araucarias
and
aralias
and
waters
that
sheltered
turtles
and
crocodiles
the
parisian
region
presented
the
same
features
in
fact
one
of
the
most
characteristic
traces
of
the
southern
sea
which
then
stretched
from
england
to
africa
in
the
south
and
india
in
the
east
indicates
a
warm
climate
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
cretaceous
ocean
over
southern
europe
had
swarmed
with
the
animalcules
whose
dead
skeletons
largely
compose
our
in
the
new
southern
ocean
another
branch
of
these
thalamophores
the
nummulites
spreads
with
such
portentous
abundance
that
its
shells
sometimes
alone
generally
with
other
material
make
beds
of
solid
limestone
several
thousand
feet
in
thickness
the
pyramids
are
built
of
this
nummulitic
limestone
the
animal
in
its
shell
is
however
no
longer
a
microscopic
grain
it
sometimes
forms
wonderful
shells
an
inch
or
more
in
diameter
in
which
as
many
as
a
thousand
chambers
succeed
each
other
in
spiral
order
from
the
centre
the
beds
containing
it
are
found
from
the
pyrenees
to
japan
that
this
vast
warm
ocean
stretching
southward
over
a
large
part
of
what
is
now
the
sahara
should
give
a
semitropical
aspect
even
to
central
europe
and
asia
is
not
surprising
but
this
genial
climate
was
still
very
general
over
the
earth
evergreens
which
now
need
the
warmth
of
italy
or
the
riviera
then
flourished
in
lapland
and
spitzbergen
the
flora
of
greenland
a
flora
that
includes
magnolias
figs
and
bamboos
shows
us
that
its
temperature
in
the
eocene
period
must
have
been
about
degrees
higher
than
it
is
the
temperature
of
the
cool
tyrol
of
modern
europe
is
calculated
to
have
then
been
between
and
degrees
palms
cactuses
aloes
cinnamon
trees
flourished
in
the
latitude
of
northern
france
the
forests
that
covered
parts
of
switzerland
which
are
now
buried
in
snow
during
a
great
part
of
the
year
were
like
the
forests
one
finds
in
parts
of
india
and
australia
the
climate
of
north
america
and
of
the
land
which
still
connected
it
with
europe
was
correspondingly
genial
the
great
authority
on
arctic
geology
heer
who
makes
this
calculation
puts
this
flora
in
the
miocene
it
is
now
usually
considered
that
these
warmer
plants
belong
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
tertiary
era
this
indulgent
period
the
oligocene
or
later
part
of
the
eocene
scattering
a
rich
and
nutritious
vegetation
with
great
profusion
over
the
land
led
to
a
notable
expansion
of
animal
life
insects
birds
and
mammals
spread
into
vast
and
varied
groups
in
every
land
had
any
of
the
great
mesozoic
reptiles
survived
the
warmer
age
might
have
enabled
them
to
dispute
the
sovereignty
of
the
advancing
mammals
but
nothing
more
formidable
than
the
turtle
the
snake
and
the
crocodile
confined
to
the
waters
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
tertiary
era
and
the
mammals
and
birds
had
the
full
advantage
of
the
new
golden
age
the
fruits
of
the
new
trees
the
grasses
which
now
covered
the
plains
and
the
insects
which
multiplied
with
the
flowers
afforded
a
magnificent
diet
the
herbivorous
mammals
became
a
populous
world
branching
into
numerous
different
types
according
to
their
different
environments
the
horse
the
elephant
the
camel
the
pig
the
deer
the
rhinoceros
gradually
emerge
out
of
the
chaos
of
evolving
forms
behind
them
hastening
the
course
of
their
evolution
improving
their
speed
arms
and
armour
is
the
inevitable
carnivore
he
too
in
the
abundance
of
food
grows
into
a
vast
population
and
branches
out
toward
familiar
types
we
will
devote
a
chapter
presently
to
this
remarkable
phase
of
the
story
of
evolution
but
the
golden
age
closes
as
all
golden
ages
had
done
before
it
and
for
the
same
reason
the
land
begins
to
rise
and
cast
the
warm
shallow
seas
from
its
face
the
expansion
of
life
has
been
more
rapid
and
remarkable
than
it
had
ever
been
before
in
corresponding
periods
of
abundant
food
and
easy
conditions
the
contraction
comes
more
quickly
than
it
had
ever
done
before
mountain
masses
begin
to
rise
in
nearly
all
parts
of
the
world
the
advance
is
slow
and
not
continuous
but
as
time
goes
on
the
atlas
alps
pyrenees
apennines
caucasus
himalaya
rocky
mountains
and
andes
rise
higher
and
higher
when
the
geologist
looks
for
the
floor
of
the
eocene
ocean
which
he
recognises
by
the
shells
of
the
nummulites
he
finds
it
feet
above
the
in
the
alps
feet
above
the
in
the
himalaya
and
feet
above
the
in
thibet
one
need
not
ask
why
the
regions
of
london
and
paris
fostered
palms
and
magnolias
and
turtles
in
tertiary
times
and
shudder
in
their
dreary
winter
the
tertiary
era
is
divided
by
geologists
into
four
periods
the
eocene
oligocene
miocene
and
pliocene
cene
is
our
barbaric
way
of
expressing
the
greek
word
for
new
and
the
classification
is
meant
to
mark
the
increase
of
new
or
modern
and
actual
types
of
life
in
the
course
of
the
tertiary
era
many
geologists
however
distrust
the
classification
and
are
disposed
to
divide
the
tertiary
into
two
periods
from
our
point
of
view
at
least
it
is
advisable
to
do
this
the
first
and
longer
half
of
the
tertiary
is
the
period
in
which
the
temperature
rises
until
central
europe
enjoys
the
climate
of
south
africa
the
second
half
is
the
period
in
which
the
land
gradually
rises
and
the
temperature
falls
until
glaciers
and
sheets
of
ice
cover
regions
where
the
palm
and
fig
had
flourished
the
rise
of
the
land
had
begun
in
the
first
half
of
the
tertiary
but
had
been
suspended
the
pyrenees
and
apennines
had
begun
to
rise
at
the
end
of
the
eocene
straining
the
crust
until
it
spluttered
with
volcanoes
casting
the
nummulitic
sea
off
large
areas
of
southern
europe
the
nummulites
become
smaller
and
less
abundant
there
is
also
some
upheaval
in
north
america
and
a
bridge
of
land
begins
to
connect
the
north
and
south
and
permit
an
effective
mingling
of
their
populations
but
the
advance
is
as
i
said
suspended
and
the
oligocene
period
maintains
the
golden
age
with
the
miocene
period
the
land
resumes
its
rise
a
chill
is
felt
along
the
american
coast
showing
a
fall
in
the
temperature
of
the
atlantic
in
europe
there
is
a
similar
chill
and
a
more
obvious
reason
for
it
there
is
an
ascending
movement
of
the
whole
series
of
mountains
from
morocco
and
the
pyrenees
through
the
alps
the
caucasus
and
the
carpathians
to
india
and
china
large
lakes
still
lie
over
western
europe
but
nearly
the
whole
of
it
emerges
from
the
ocean
the
mediterranean
still
sends
an
arm
up
france
and
with
another
arm
encircles
the
alpine
mass
but
the
upheaval
continues
and
the
great
nummulitic
sea
is
reduced
to
a
series
of
extensive
lakes
cut
off
both
from
the
atlantic
and
pacific
the
climate
of
southern
europe
is
probably
still
as
genial
as
that
of
the
canaries
palms
still
linger
in
the
landscape
in
reduced
numbers
the
last
part
of
the
tertiary
the
pliocene
opens
with
a
slight
return
of
the
sea
the
upheaval
is
once
more
suspended
and
the
waters
are
eating
into
the
land
there
is
some
foundering
of
land
at
the
tip
of
europe
the
straits
of
gibraltar
begin
to
connect
the
mediterranean
with
the
atlantic
and
the
balearic
islands
corsica
and
sardinia
remain
as
the
mountain
summits
of
a
submerged
land
then
the
upheaval
is
resumed
in
nearly
every
part
of
the
earth
nearly
every
great
mountain
chain
that
the
geologist
has
studied
shared
in
this
remarkable
movement
at
the
end
of
the
tertiary
era
the
pyrenees
alps
himalaya
made
their
last
ascent
and
attained
their
present
elevation
and
as
the
land
rose
the
aspect
of
europe
and
america
slowly
altered
the
palms
figs
bamboos
and
magnolias
disappeared
the
turtles
crocodiles
flamingoes
and
hippopotamuses
retreated
toward
the
equator
the
snow
began
to
gather
thick
on
the
rising
heights
then
the
glaciers
began
to
glitter
on
their
flanks
as
the
cold
increased
the
rivers
of
ice
which
flowed
down
the
hills
of
switzerland
spain
scotland
or
scandinavia
advanced
farther
and
farther
over
the
plains
the
regions
of
green
vegetation
shrank
before
the
oncoming
ice
the
animals
retreated
south
or
developed
arctic
features
europe
and
america
were
ushering
in
the
great
which
was
to
bury
five
or
six
million
square
miles
of
their
territory
under
a
thick
mantle
of
ice
such
is
the
general
outline
of
the
story
of
the
tertiary
era
we
approach
the
study
of
its
types
of
life
and
their
remarkable
development
more
intelligently
when
we
have
first
given
careful
attention
to
this
extraordinary
series
of
physical
changes
short
as
the
era
is
compared
with
its
predecessors
it
is
even
more
eventful
and
stimulating
than
they
and
closes
with
what
professor
chamberlin
calls
the
greatest
deformative
movements
in
history
in
the
main
it
has
from
the
evolutionary
point
of
view
the
same
significant
character
as
the
two
preceding
eras
its
middle
portion
is
an
age
of
expansion
indulgence
exuberance
in
which
myriads
of
varied
forms
are
thrown
upon
the
scene
its
later
part
is
an
age
of
contraction
of
annihilation
of
drastic
test
in
which
the
more
effectively
organised
will
be
chosen
from
the
myriads
of
types
once

nature
has
engendered
a
vast
brood
and

about
to
select
some
of
her
offspring

the

the
flower
and
the

as
we
approach
the
last
part
of
the
geological
record
we
must
neglect
the
lower
types
of
life
which
have
hitherto
occupied
so
much
of
our
attention
so
that
we
may
inquire
more
fully
into
the
origin
and
fortunes
of
the
higher
forms
which
now
fill
the
stage
it
may
be
noted
in
general
terms
that
they
shared
the
opulence
of
the
period
produced
some
gigantic
specimens
of
their
respective
families
and
evolved
into
the
genera
and
often
the
species
which
we
find
living
a
few
illustrations
will
suffice
to
give
some
idea
of
the
later
development
of
the
lower
invertebrates
and
vertebrates
monstrous
oysters
bear
witness
to
the
prosperity
of
that
ancient
and

some
of

at

this

carcharodon

will
therefore
first
describe
the
advance
of
the
tertiary
vegetation
the
luxuriance
of
which
was
the
first
condition
of
the
great
expansion
of
animal
life
then
we
will
glance
at
the
grand
army
of
the
insects
which
followed
the
development
of
the
flowers
and
at
the
accompanying
expansion
and
ramification
of
the
birds
the
long
and
interesting
story
of
the
mammals
must
be
told
in
a
separate
chapter
and
a
further
chapter
must
be
devoted
to
the
appearance
of
the
human
species
we
saw
that
the
angiosperms
or
flowering
plants
appeared
at
the
beginning
of
the
cretaceous
period
and
were
richly
developed
before
the
tertiary
era
opened
we
saw
also
that
their
precise
origin
is
unknown
they
suddenly
invade
a
part
of
north
america
where
there
were
conditions
for
preserving
some
traces
of
them
but
we
have
as
yet
no
remains
of
their
early
forms
or
clue
to
their
place
of
development
we
may
conjecture
that
their
ancestors
had
been
living
in
some
elevated
inland
region
during
the
warmth
of
the
jurassic
period
as
it
is
now
known
that
many
of
the
mesozoic
plants
bore
flowers
as
the
modern
botanist
scarcely
hesitates
to
call
them
the
gap
between
the
gymnosperms
and
angiosperms
is
very
much
lessened
there
are
however
structural
differences
which
forbid
us
to
regard
any
of
these
flowering
cycads
which
we
have
yet
found
as
the
ancestors
of
the
angiosperms
the
most
reasonable
view
seems
to
be
that
a
small
and
local
branch
of
these
primitive
flowering
plants
was
evolved
like
the
rest
in
the
stress
of
the
cold
that
instead
of
descending
to
the
warm
moist
levels
with
the
rest
at
the
end
of
the
triassic
and
developing
the
definite
characters
of
the
cycad
it
remained
on
the
higher
and
cooler
land
and
that
the
rise
of
land
at
the
end
of
the
jurassic
period
stimulated
the
development
of
its
angiosperm
features
enlarged
the
area
in
which
it
was
especially
fitted
to
thrive
and
so
permitted
it
to
spread
and
suddenly
break
into
the
geological
record
as
a
fully
developed
angiosperm
as
the
cycads
shrank
in
the
cretaceous
period
the
angiosperms
deployed
with
great
rapidity
and
spreading
at
various
levels
and
in
different
kinds
of
soils
and
climates
branched
into
hundreds
of
different
types
we
saw
that
the
oak
beech
elm
maple
palm
grass
were
well
developed
before
the
end
of
the
cretaceous
period
the
botanist
divides
the
angiosperms
into
two
leading
groups
the
monocotyledons
palms
grasses
lilies
orchises
irises
etc
and
dicotyledons
the
vast
majority
and
it
is
now
generally
believed
that
the
former
were
developed
from
an
early
and
primitive
branch
of
the
latter
but
it
is
impossible
to
retrace
the
lines
of
development
of
the
innumerable
types
of
angiosperms
the
geologist
has
mainly
to
rely
on
a
few
stray
leaves
that
were
swept
into
the
lakes
and
preserved
in
the
mud
and
the
evidence
they
afford
is
far
too
slender
for
the
construction
of
genealogical
trees
the
student
of
living
plants
can
go
a
little
further
in
discovering
relationships
and
when
we
find
him
tracing
such
apparently
remote
plants
as
the
apple
and
the
strawberry
to
a
common
ancestor
with
the
rose
we
foresee
interesting
possibilities
on
the
botanical
side
but
the
evolution
of
the
angiosperms
is
a
recent
and
immature
study
and
we
will
be
content
with
a
few
reflections
on
the
struggle
of
the
various
types
of
trees
in
the
changing
conditions
of
the
tertiary
the
development
of
the
grasses
and
the
evolution
of
the
flower
in
other
words
we
will
be
content
to
ask
how
the
modern
landscape
obtained
its
general
vegetal
features
broadly
speaking
the
vegetation
of
the
first
part
of
the
tertiary
era
was
a
mixture
of
and
temperate
forms
a
confused
mass
of
ferns
conifers
ginkgoales
monocotyledons
and
dicotyledons
here
is
a
casual
list
of
plants
that
then
grew
in
the
latitude
of
london
and
paris
the
palm
magnolia
myrtle
banksia
vine
fig
aralea
sequoia
eucalyptus
cinnamon
tree
cactus
agave
tulip
tree
apple
plum
bamboo
almond
plane
maple
willow
oak
evergreen
oak
laurel
beech
cedar
etc
the
landscape
must
have
been
extraordinarily
varied
and
beautiful
and
rich
to
one
botanist
it
suggests
malaysia
to
another
india
to
another
australia
it
is
really
the
last
gathering
of
the
plants
before
the
great
dispersion
then
the
cold
creeps
slowly
down
from
the
arctic
regions
and
begins
to
reduce
the
variety
we
can
clearly
trace
its
gradual
advance
in
the
carboniferous
and
jurassic
the
vegetation
of
the
arctic
regions
had
been
the
same
as
that
of
england
in
the
eocene
palms
can
flourish
in
england
but
not
further
north
in
the
pliocene
the
palms
and
bamboos
and
species
are
driven
out
of
europe
in
the
pleistocene
the
advances
to
the
valleys
of
the
thames
and
the
danube
and
proportionately
in
the
united
states
every
species
is
annihilated
and
our
grasses
oaks
beeches
elms
apples
plums
linger
on
the
green
southern
fringe
of
the
continent
and
in
a
few
uncovered
regions
ready
to
spread
north
once
more
as
the
ice
creeps
back
towards
the
alps
or
the
arctic
circle
thus
in
few
words
did
europe
and
north
america
come
to
have
the
vegetation
we
find
in
them
the
next
broad
characteristic
of
our
landscape
is
the
spreading
carpet
of
grass
the
interest
of
the
evolution
of
the
grasses
will
be
seen
later
when
we
shall
find
the
evolution
of
the
horse
for
instance
following
very
closely
upon
it
so
striking
indeed
is
the
connection
between
the
advance
of
the
grasses
and
the
advance
of
the
mammals
that
russel
wallace
has
recently
claimed
the
world
of
life
that
there
is
a
clear
purposive
arrangement
in
the
whole
chain
of
developments
which
leads
to
the
appearance
of
the
grasses
he
says
that
the
very
puzzling
facts
of
the
immense
reptilian
development
in
the
mesozoic
can
only
be
understood
on
the
supposition
that
they
were
evolved
to
keep
down
the
coarser
vegetation
to
supply
animal
food
for
the
larger
carnivora
and
thus
give
time
for
higher
forms
to
obtain
a
secure
foothold
and
a
sufficient
amount
of
varied
form
and
structure
every
insistence
on
the
close
connection
of
the
different
strands
in
the
web
of
life
is
welcome
but
wallace
does
not
seem
to
have
learned
the
facts
accurately
there
is
nothing
puzzling
about
the
mesozoic
reptilian
development
the
depression
of
the
land
the
moist
warmth
and
the
luscious
vegetation
of
the
later
triassic
and
the
jurassic
amply
explain
it
again
the
only
carnivores
to
whom
they
seem
to
have
supplied
food
were
reptiles
of
their
own
race
nor
can
the
feeding
of
the
herbivorous
reptiles
be
connected
with
the
rise
of
the
angiosperms
we
do
not
find
the
flowering
plants
developing
anywhere
in
those
vast
regions
where
the
great
reptiles
abounded
they
invade
them
from
some
single
unknown
region
and
mingle
with
the
pines
and
ginkgoes
while
the
cyeads
alone
are
destroyed
the
grasses
in
particular
do
not
appear
until
the
cretaceous
and
do
not
show
much
development
until
the
and
their
development
seems
to
be
chiefly
connected
with
physical
conditions
the
meandering
rivers
and
broad
lakes
of
the
would
have
their
fringes
of
grass
and
sedge
and
as
the
lakes
dried
up
in
the
vicissitudes
of
climate
large
areas
of
grass
would
be
left
on
their
sites
to
these
primitive
prairies
the
mammal
not
reptile
herbivores
would
be
attracted
with
important
results
the
consequences
to
the
animals
we
will
consider
presently
the
effect
on
the
grasses
may
be
well
understood
on
the
lines
so
usefully
indicated
in
wallace
book
the
incessant
cropping
age
after
age
would
check
the
growth
of
the
larger
and
coarser
grasses
give
opportunity
to
the
smaller
and
finer
and
lead
in
time
to
the
development
of
the
grassy
plains
of
the
modern
world
thus
one
more
familiar
feature
was
added
to
the
landscape
in
the
tertiary
era
as
this
fresh
green
carpet
spread
over
the
formerly
naked
plains
it
began
to
be
enriched
with
our
coloured
flowers
there
were
large
flowers
we
saw
on
some
of
the
mesozoic
cycads
but
their
sober
yellows
and
greens
to
judge
from
their
descendants
would
do
little
to
brighten
the
landscape
it
is
in
the
course
of
the
tertiary
era
that
the
mantle
of
green
begins
to
be
embroidered
with
the
brilliant
hues
of
our
flowers
grant
allen
put
forward
in
the
colours
of
flowers
an
interesting
theory
of
the
appearance
of
the
colours
of
flowers
and
it
is
regarded
as
probable
he
observed
that
most
of
the
simplest
flowers
are
yellow
the
more
advanced
flowers
of
simple
families
and
the
simpler
flowers
of
slightly
advanced
families
are
generally
white
or
pink
the
most
advanced
flowers
of
all
families
and
almost
all
the
flowers
of
the
more
advanced
families
are
red
purple
or
blue
and
the
most
advanced
flowers
of
the
most
advanced
families
are
always
either
blue
or
variegated
professor
henslow
adds
a
number
of
equally
significant
facts
with
the
same
tendency
so
that
we
have
strong
reason
to
conceive
the
floral
world
as
passing
through
successive
phases
of
colour
in
the
tertiary
era
at
first
it
would
be
a
world
of
yellows
and
greens
like
that
of
the
mesozoic
vegetation
but
brighter
in
time
splashes
of
red
and
white
would
lie
on
the
face
of
the
landscape
and
later
would
come
the
purples
the
rich
blues
and
the
variegated
colours
of
the
more
advanced
flowers
why
the
colours
came
at
all
is
a
question
closely
connected
with
the
general
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
flower
at
which
we
must
glance
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
flower
in
the
botanist
judgment
is
the
central
green
organ
which
you
find
say
in
a
lily
standing
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floral
structure
with
a
number
of
rods
round
it
the
yellow
rods
bear
the
male
germinal
elements
pollen
the
central
pistil
encloses
the
ovules
or
female
elements
angiosperm
means
plant
and
its
characteristic
is
this
protection
of
the
ovules
within
a
special
chamber
to
which
the
pollen
alone
may
penetrate
round
these
essential
organs
are
the
coloured
petals
of
the
corolla
the
chief
part
of
the
flower
to
the
unscientific
mind
and
the
sepals
often
also
coloured
of
the
calyx
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
these
parts
arose
from
modifications
of
the
leaves
or
stems
of
the
primitive
plant
though
whether
the
bright
leaves
of
the
corolla
are
directly
derived
from
ordinary
leaves
or
are
enlarged
and
flattened
stamens
has
been
disputed
and
to
the
question
why
these
bright
petals
whose
colour
and
variety
of
form
lend
such
charm
to
the
world
of
flowers
have
been
developed
at
all
most
botanists
will
give
a
prompt
and
very
interesting
reply
as
both
male
and
female
elements
are
usually
in
one
flower
it
may
fertilise
itself
the
pollen
falling
directly
on
the
pistil
but
fertilisation
is
more
sure
and
effective
if
the
pollen
comes
from
a
different
individual
if
there
is
cross
fertilisation
this
may
be
accomplished
by
the
simple
agency
of
the
wind
blowing
the
pollen
broadcast
but
it
is
done
much
better
by
insects
which
brush
against
the
stamens
and
carry
grains
of
the
pollen
to
the
next
flower
they
visit
we
have
here
a
very
fertile
line
of
development
among
the
primitive
flowers
the
insects
begin
to
visit
them
for
their
pollen
or
juices
and
them
if
this
is
an
advantage
attractiveness
to
insects
will
become
so
important
a
feature
that
natural
selection
will
develop
it
more
and
more
in
plain
english
what
is
meant
is
that
those
flowers
which
are
more
attractive
to
insects
will
be
the
most
surely
fertilised
and
breed
most
and
the
prolonged
application
of
this
principle
during
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
will
issue
in
the
immense
variety
of
our
flowers
they
will
be
enriched
with
little
stores
of
honey
and
nectar
not
so
mysterious
an
advantage
when
we
reflect
on
the
concentration
of
the
juices
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
seed
then
they
must
advertise
their
stores
and
the
strong
perfumes
and
bright
colours
begin
to
develop
and
ensure
posterity
to
their
possessors
the
shape
of
the
corolla
will
be
altered
in
hundreds
of
ways
to
accommodate
and
attract
the
useful
visitor
and
shut
out
the
mere
robber
these
utilities
together
with
the
various
modifying
agencies
of
different
environments
are
generally
believed
to
have
led
to
the
bewildering
variety
and
great
beauty
of
our
floral
world
it
is
proper
to
add
that
this
view
has
been
sharply
challenged
by
a
number
of
recent
writers
it
is
questioned
if
colours
and
scents
do
attract
insects
though
several
recent
series
of
experiments
seem
to
show
that
bees
are
certainly
attracted
by
colours
it
is
questioned
if
has
really
the
importance
ascribed
to
it
since
the
days
of
darwin
some
of
these
writers
believe
that
the
colours
and
the
peculiar
shape
which
the
petals
take
in
some
flowers
orchises
for
instance
have
been
evolved
to
deter
browsing
animals
from
eating
them
the
theory
is
thus
only
a
different
application
of
natural
selection
professor
henslow
on
the
other
hand
stands
alone
in
denying
the
selection
and
believing
that
the
insects
directly
developed
the
scents
honeys
colours
and
shapes
by
mechanical
irritation
the
great
majority
of
botanists
adhere
to
the
older
view
and
see
in
the
wonderful
tertiary
expansion
of
the
flowers
a
manifold
adaptation
to
the
insect
friends
and
insect
foes
which
then
became
very
abundant
and
varied
resisting
the
temptation
to
glance
at
the
marvellous
adaptations
which
we
find
in
our
plant
world
the
plants
the
climbers
the
parasites
the
sensitive
plants
the
plants
in
dry
regions
and
so
on
we
must
turn
to
the
consideration
of
the
insects
themselves
we
have
already
studied
the
evolution
of
the
insect
in
general
and
seen
its
earlier
forms
the
tertiary
era
not
only
witnessed
a
great
deployment
of
the
insects
but
was
singularly
rich
in
means
of
preserving
them
the
fly
in
amber
has
ceased
to
be
a
puzzle
even
to
the
inexpert
amber
is
the
resin
that
exuded
from
trees
especially
in
the
baltic
region
in
the
eocene
and
oligocene
periods
insects
stuck
in
the
resin
and
were
buried
under
fresh
layers
of
it
and
we
find
them
embalmed
in
it
as
we
pick
up
the
resin
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
the
tertiary
lakes
were
also
important
cemeteries
of
insects
a
great
bed
at
florissart
in
colorado
is
described
by
one
of
the
american
experts
who
examined
it
as
a
tertiary
pompeii
it
has
yielded
specimens
of
about
a
thousand
species
of
tertiary
insects
near
the
large
ancient
lake
of
which
it
marks
the
site
was
a
volcano
and
the
fine
ash
yielded
from
the
cone
seems
to
have
buried
myriads
of
insects
in
the
water
at
oeningen
a
similar
has
although
only
a
few
feet
thick
yielded
species
of
insects
yet
these
rich
and
numerous
finds
throw
little
light
on
the
evolution
of
the
insect
except
in
the
general
sense
that
they
show
species
and
even
genera
quite
different
from
those
of
no
new
families
of
insects
have
appeared
since
the
eocene
and
the
ancient
types
had
by
that
time
disappeared
since
the
eocene
however
the
species
have
been
almost
entirely
changed
so
that
the
insect
record
from
its
commencement
in
the
primary
era
has
the
stamp
of
evolution
on
every
page
of
it
unfortunately
insects
especially
the
higher
and
later
insects
are
such
frail
structures
that
they
are
only
preserved
in
very
rare
conditions
the
most
important
event
of
the
in
the
tertiary
is
the
arrival
of
the
butterflies
which
then
appear
for
the
first
time
we
may
assume
that
they
spread
with
great
rapidity
and
abundance
in
the
rich
floral
world
of
the
more
than
species
of
lepidoptera
are
known
and
there
are
probably
twice
that
number
yet
to
be
classified
by
the
entomologist
but
so
far
the
tertiary
deposits
have
yielded
only
the
fragmentary
remains
of
about
twenty
individual
butterflies
the
evolutionary
study
of
the
insects
is
therefore
not
so
much
concerned
with
the
various
modifications
of
the
three
pairs
of
jaws
inherited
from
the
primitive
tracheate
and
the
wings
which
have
given
us
our
vast
variety
of
species
it
is
directed
rather
to
the
more
interesting
questions
of
what
are
called
the
instincts
of
the
insects
the
remarkable
metamorphosis
by
which
the
young
of
the
higher
orders
attain
the
adult
form
and
the
extraordinary
colouring
and
marking
of
bees
wasps
and
butterflies
even
these
questions
however
are
so
large
that
only
a
few
words
can
be
said
here
on
the
tendencies
of
recent
research
in
regard
to
the
psychic
powers
of
insects
it
may
be
said
in
the
first
place
that
it
is
seriously
disputed
among
the
modern
authorities
whether
even
the
highest
insects
the
ant
bee
and
wasp
have
any
degree
whatever
of
the
intelligence
which
an
earlier
generation
generously
bestowed
on
them
wasmann
and
bethe
two
of
the
leading
authorities
on
ants
take
the
negative
view
forel
claims
that
they
show
occasional
traces
of
intelligence
it
is
at
all
events
clear
that
the
enormous
majority
of
if
not
all
their
activities
and
especially
those
activities
of
the
ant
and
the
bee
which
chiefly
impress
the
imagination
are
not
intelligent
but
instinctive
actions
and
the
second
point
to
be
noted
is
that
the
word
instinct
in
the
old
sense
of
some
innate
power
or
faculty
directing
the
life
of
an
animal
has
been
struck
out
of
the
modern
scientific
dictionary
the
ant
or
bee
inherits
a
certain
mechanism
of
nerves
and
muscles
which
will
in
certain
circumstances
act
in
the
way
we
call
instinctive
the
problem
is
to
find
how
this
mechanism
and
its
remarkable
actions
were
slowly
evolved
in
view
of
the
innumerable
and
infinitely
varied
forms
of
instinct
in
the
insect
world
we
must
restrict
ourselves
to
a
single
illustration
say
the
social
life
of
the
ants
and
the
bees
we
are
not
without
indications
of
the
gradual
development
of
this
social
life
in
the
case
of
the
ant
we
find
that
the
tertiary
specimens
and
about
a
hundred
species
are
found
in
switzerland
alone
whereas
there
are
only
fifty
species
in
the
whole
of
europe
all
have
wings
and
are
apparently
of
the
two
sexes
not
neutral
this
seems
to
indicate
that
even
in
the
some
millions
of
years
after
the
first
appearance
of
the
ant
the
social
life
which
we
admire
in
the
ants
today
had
not
yet
been
developed
the
tertiary
bees
on
the
other
hand
are
said
to
show
some
traces
of
the
division
of
labour
and
modification
of
structure
which
make
the
bees
so
interesting
but
in
this
case
the
living
bees
rising
from
a
solitary
life
through
increasing
stages
of
social
give
us
some
idea
of
the
gradual
development
of
this
remarkable
citizenship
it
seems
to
me
that
the
great
selective
agency
which
has
brought
about
these
and
many
other
remarkable
activities
of
the
insects
such
as
the
storing
of
food
with
their
eggs
by
wasps
was
probably
the
occurrence
of
periods
of
cold
and
especially
the
beginning
of
a
winter
season
in
the
cretaceous
or
tertiary
age
in
the
periods
of
luxuriant
life
the
carboniferous
the
jurassic
or
the
oligocene
when
insects
swarmed
and
varied
in
every
direction
some
would
vary
in
the
direction
of
a
more
effective
placing
of
the
eggs
and
the
supervening
period
of
cold
and
scarcity
would
favour
them
when
a
regular
winter
season
set
in
this
tendency
would
be
enormously
increased
it
is
a
parallel
case
to
the
evolution
of
the
birds
and
mammals
from
the
reptiles
those
that
varied
most
in
the
direction
of
care
for
the
egg
and
the
young
would
have
the
largest
share
in
the
next
generation
when
we
further
reflect
that
since
the
tertiary
the
insect
world
has
passed
through
the
drastic
disturbance
of
the
climate
in
the
great
we
seem
to
have
an
illuminating
clue
to
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
higher
insect
life
the
origin
of
the
colour
marks
and
patterns
on
so
many
of
the
higher
insects
with
which
we
may
join
the
origin
of
the
is
a
subject
of
lively
controversy
in
science
the
protective
value
of
the
appearance
of
insects
which
look
almost
exactly
like
dried
twigs
or
decaying
leaves
and
of
an
arrangement
of
the
colours
of
the
wings
of
butterflies
which
makes
them
almost
invisible
when
at
rest
is
so
obvious
that
natural
selection
was
confidently
invoked
to
explain
them
in
other
cases
certain
colours
or
marks
seemed
to
have
a
value
as
warning
colours
advertising
the
nauseousness
of
their
possessors
to
the
bird
which
had
learned
to
recognise
them
in
other
cases
these
colours
and
marks
seemed
to
be
borrowed
by
palatable
species
whose
unconscious
mimicry
led
to
their
survival
in
other
cases
again
the
patterns
and
spots
were
regarded
as
recognition
marks
by
which
the
male
could
find
his
mate
science
is
just
now
passing
through
a
phase
of
acute
criticism
as
the
reader
will
have
realised
by
this
time
and
many
of
the
positions
confidently
adopted
in
the
earlier
constructive
stage
are
challenged
this
applies
to
the
protective
colours
warning
colours
mimicry
of
insects
probably
some
of
the
affirmations
of
the
older
generation
of
evolutionists
were
too
rigid
and
extensive
and
probably
the
denials
of
the
new
generation
are
equally
exaggerated
when
all
sound
criticism
has
been
met
there
remains
a
vast
amount
of
protective
colouring
shaping
and
marking
in
the
insect
world
of
which
natural
selection
gives
us
the
one
plausible
explanation
but
the
doctrine
of
natural
selection
does
not
mean
that
every
feature
of
an
animal
shall
have
a
certain
utility
it
will
destroy
animals
with
injurious
variations
and
favour
animals
with
useful
variations
but
there
may
be
a
large
amount
of
variation
especially
in
colour
to
which
it
is
quite
indifferent
in
this
way
much
may
develop
either
from
ordinary
embryonic
variations
or
as
experiment
on
butterflies
shows
from
the
direct
influence
of
surroundings
which
has
no
vital
significance
in
this
way
too
small
variations
of
no
selective
value
may
gradually
increase
until
they
chance
to
have
a
value
to
the
animal
for
a
strong
statement
of
the
new
critical
position
see
dewar
and
finn
making
of
species
ch
vi
the
origin
of
the
metamorphosis
or
of
the
higher
insects
with
all
its
wonderful
protective
devices
is
so
obscure
and
controverted
that
we
must
pass
over
it
some
authorities
think
that
the
has
been
evolved
for
the
protection
of
the
helpless
transforming
insect
some
believe
that
it
occurs
because
movement
would
be
injurious
to
the
insect
in
that
stage
some
say
that
the
muscular
system
is
actually
dissolved
in
its
connections
and
some
recent
experts
suggest
that
it
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
fact
that
the
ancestors
of
the
metamorphosing
insects
were
addicted
to
internal
parasitism
in
their
youth
it
is
one
of
the
problems
of
the
future
at
present
we
have
no
fossil
though
we
have
one
caterpillar
to
guide
us
we
must
leave
these
fascinating
but
difficult
problems
of
insect
life
and
glance
at
the
evolution
of
the
birds
to
the
student
of
nature
whose
interest
is
confined
to
one
branch
of
science
the
record
of
life
is
a
mysterious
succession
of
waves
a
comprehensive
view
of
nature
living
and
past
and
present
discovers
scores
of
illuminating
connections
and
even
sees
at
times
the
inevitable
sequence
of
events
thus
if
the
rise
of
the
angiospermous
vegetation
on
the
ruins
of
the
mesozoic
world
is
understood
in
the
light
of
geological
and
climatic
changes
and
the
consequent
deploying
of
the
insects
especially
the
suctorial
insects
is
a
natural
result
the
simultaneous
triumph
of
the
birds
is
not
unintelligible
the
grains
and
fruits
of
the
angiosperms
and
the
vast
swarms
of
insects
provided
immense
stores
of
food
the
annihilation
of
the
pterosaurs
left
a
whole
stratum
of
the
earth
free
for
their
occupation
we
saw
that
a
primitive
bird
with
very
striking
reptilian
features
was
found
in
the
jurassic
rocks
suggesting
very
clearly
the
evolution
of
the
bird
from
the
reptile
in
the
cold
of
the
permian
or
triassic
period
in
the
cretaceous
we
found
the
birds
distributed
in
a
number
of
genera
but
of
two
leading
types
the
ichthyornis
type
was
a
flying
bird
with
socketed
teeth
and
biconcave
vertebrae
like
the
reptile
but
otherwise
fully
evolved
into
a
bird
its
line
is
believed
to
survive
in
the
gannets
cormorants
pelicans
and
of
the
less
numerous
hesperornis
group
were
large
and
powerful
divers
then
there
is
a
blank
in
the
record
representing
the
cretaceous
upheaval
and
it
unfortunately
conceals
the
first
great
ramification
of
the
bird
world
when
the
light
falls
again
on
the
eocene
period
we
find
great
numbers
of
our
familiar
types
quite
developed
primitive
types
of
gulls
herons
pelicans
quails
ibises
flamingoes
albatrosses
buzzards
hornbills
falcons
eagles
owls
plovers
and
woodcocks
are
found
in
the
eocene
beds
the
oligocene
beds
add
parrots
trogons
cranes
marabouts
grouse
swallows
and
woodpeckers
we
can
not
suppose
that
every
type
has
been
preserved
but
we
see
that
our
was
virtually
created
in
the
early
part
of
the
tertiary
era
with
these
more
or
less
familiar
types
were
large
survivors
of
the
older
order
in
the
bed
of
the
sea
which
covered
the
site
of
london
in
the
eocene
are
found
the
remains
of
a
toothed
bird
odontopteryx
though
the
teeth
are
merely
sharp
outgrowths
of
the
edge
of
the
bill
another
bird
of
the
same
period
and
region
gastornis
stood
about
ten
feet
high
and
must
have
looked
something
like
a
wading
ostrich
other
large
waders
even
more
in
structure
lived
in
north
america
and
in
patagonia
the
remains
have
been
found
of
a
massive
bird
about
eight
feet
high
with
a
head
larger
than
that
of
any
living
animal
except
the
elephant
rhinoceros
and
hippopotamus
chamberlin
the
absence
of
early
eocene
remains
prevents
us
from
tracing
the
lines
of
our
vast
and
varied
to
their
mesozoic
beginnings
and
when
we
appeal
to
the
zoologist
to
supply
the
missing
links
of
relationship
by
a
comparison
of
the
structures
of
living
birds
we
receive
only
uncertain
and
very
general
suggestions
he
tells
us
that
the
especially
the
emus
and
cassowaries
are
one
of
the
most
primitive
stocks
of
the
bird
world
and
that
the
ancient
dinornis
group
and
the
recently
extinct
moas
seem
to
be
offshoots
of
that
stock
the
remaining
many
thousand
species
of
carinate
birds
or
flying
birds
with
a
keel
carina
for
the
attachment
of
the
flying
muscles
are
then
gathered
into
two
great
branches
which
are
traceable
to
a
common
stock
pycraft
and
branch
in
their
turn
along
the
later
lines
of
development
one
of
these
lines
the
pelicans
cormorants
seems
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
ichthyornis
type
of
the
cretaceous
with
the
odontopteryx
as
an
eocene
offshoot
the
divers
penguins
grebes
and
petrels
represent
another
ancient
stock
which
may
be
related
to
the
hesperornis
group
of
the
cretaceous
chalmers
mitchell
thinks
that
the
screamers
of
south
america
are
the
nearest
representatives
of
the
common
ancestor
of
the
birds
but
even
to
give
the
broader
divisions
of
the
species
of
living
birds
would
be
of
little
interest
to
the
general
reader
the
best
treatment
of
the
subject
will
be
found
in
pycraft
history
of
birds
the
special
problems
of
are
as
numerous
and
unsettled
as
those
of
the
insects
there
is
the
same
dispute
as
to
protective
colours
and
recognition
marks
the
same
uncertainty
as
to
the
origin
of
such
instinctive
practices
as
migration
and
nesting
the
general
feeling
is
that
the
annual
migration
had
its
origin
in
the
overcrowding
of
the
regions
in
which
birds
could
live
all
the
year
round
they
therefore
pushed
northward
in
the
spring
and
remained
north
until
the
winter
impoverishment
drove
them
south
again
on
this
view
each
group
would
be
returning
to
its
ancestral
home
led
by
the
older
birds
in
the
great
migration
flights
the
curious
paths
they
follow
are
believed
by
some
authorities
to
mark
the
original
lines
of
their
spread
preserved
from
generation
to
generation
through
the
annual
lead
of
the
older
birds
if
we
recollect
the
which
drove
the
vast
majority
of
the
birds
south
at
the
end
of
the
tertiary
and
imagine
them
later
following
the
northward
retreat
of
the
ice
from
their
narrowed
and
overcrowded
southern
territory
we
may
not
be
far
from
the
secret
of
the
annual
migration
a
more
important
controversy
is
conducted
in
regard
to
the
gorgeous
plumage
and
other
decorations
and
weapons
of
the
male
birds
darwin
as
is
known
advanced
a
theory
of
sexual
selection
to
explain
these
the
male
peacock
to
take
a
concrete
instance
would
have
developed
its
beautiful
tail
because
through
tens
of
thousands
of
generations
the
female
selected
the
more
finely
tailed
male
among
the
various
suitors
wallace
and
other
authorities
always
disputed
this
aesthetic
sentiment
and
choice
on
the
part
of
the
female
the
general
opinion
today
is
that
darwin
theory
could
not
be
sustained
in
the
range
and
precise
sense
he
gave
to
it
some
kind
of
display
by
the
male
in
the
breeding
season
would
be
an
advantage
but
to
suppose
that
the
females
of
any
species
of
birds
or
mammals
had
the
definite
and
uniform
taste
necessary
for
the
creation
of
male
characters
by
sexual
selection
is
more
than
difficult
they
seem
to
be
connected
in
origin
rather
with
the
higher
vitality
of
the
male
but
the
lines
on
which
they
were
selected
are
not
yet
understood
this
general
sketch
of
the
enrichment
of
the
earth
with
flowering
plants
insects
and
birds
in
the
tertiary
era
is
all
that
the
limits
of
the
present
work
permit
us
to
give
it
is
an
age
of
exuberant
life
and
abundant
food
the
teeming
populations
overflow
their
primitive
boundaries
and
in
adapting
themselves
to
every
form
of
diet
every
phase
of
environment
and
every
device
of
capture
or
escape
the
spreading
organisms
are
moulded
into
tens
of
thousands
of
species
we
shall
see
this
more
clearly
in
the
evolution
of
the
mammals
what
we
chiefly
learn
from
the
present
chapter
is
the
vital
interconnection
of
the
various
parts
of
nature
geological
changes
favour
the
spread
of
a
certain
type
of
vegetation
insects
are
attracted
to
its
nutritious
and
an
age
of
this
form
of
parasitism
leads
to
a
signal
modification
of
the
jaws
of
the
insects
themselves
and
to
the
lavish
variety
and
brilliance
of
the
flowers
birds
are
attracted
to
the
nutritious
matter
enclosing
the
seeds
and
as
it
is
an
advantage
to
the
plant
that
its
seeds
be
scattered
beyond
the
already
populated
area
by
passing
through
the
alimentary
canal
of
the
bird
and
being
discharged
with
its
excrements
a
fresh
line
of
evolution
leads
to
the
appearance
of
the
large
and
coloured
fruits
the
birds
again
turn
upon
the
swarming
insects
and
the
steady
selection
they
exercise
leads
to
the
zigzag
flight
and
the
protective
colour
of
the
butterfly
the
concealment
of
the
grub
and
the
pupa
the
marking
of
the
caterpillar
and
so
on
we
can
understand
the
living
nature
of
as
the
outcome
of
that
teeming
striving
changing
world
of
the
tertiary
era
just
as
it
in
turn
was
the
natural
outcome
of
the
ages
that
had
gone
before
chapter
xvii
the
origin
of
our
mammals
in
our
study
of
the
evolution
of
the
plant
the
insect
and
the
bird
we
were
seriously
thwarted
by
the
circumstance
that
their
frames
somewhat
frail
in
themselves
were
rarely
likely
to
be
entombed
in
good
conditions
for
preservation
earlier
critics
of
evolution
used
when
they
were
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
conditions
of
fossilisation
to
insinuate
that
this
fragmentary
nature
of
the
geological
record
was
a
very
convenient
refuge
for
the
evolutionist
who
was
pressed
for
positive
evidence
the
complaint
is
no
longer
found
in
any
serious
work
where
we
find
excellent
conditions
for
preservation
and
animals
suitable
for
preservation
living
in
the
midst
of
them
the
record
is
quite
satisfactory
we
saw
how
the
chalk
has
yielded
remains
of
in
the
actual
and
gradual
process
of
evolution
tertiary
beds
which
represent
the
muddy
bottoms
of
tranquil
lakes
are
sometimes
equally
instructive
in
their
fossils
especially
of
the
paludina
of
a
certain
slavonian
is
a
classical
example
it
changes
so
greatly
in
the
successive
levels
of
the
deposit
that
if
the
intermediate
forms
were
not
preserved
we
should
divide
it
into
several
different
species
the
planorbis
is
another
example
in
this
case
we
have
a
species
evolving
along
several
distinct
lines
into
forms
which
differ
remarkably
from
each
other
the
tertiary
mammals
living
generally
on
the
land
and
only
coming
by
accident
into
deposits
suitable
for
preservation
can
not
be
expected
to
reveal
anything
like
this
sensible
advance
from
form
to
form
they
were
however
so
numerous
in
the
and
their
bones
are
so
well
calculated
to
survive
when
they
do
fall
into
suitable
conditions
that
we
can
follow
their
development
much
more
easily
than
that
of
the
birds
we
find
a
number
of
strange
patriarchal
beasts
entering
the
scene
in
the
early
eocene
and
spreading
into
a
great
variety
of
forms
in
the
genial
conditions
of
the
oligocene
and
miocene
as
some
of
these
forms
advance
we
begin
to
descry
in
them
the
features
remote
and
shadowy
at
first
of
the
horse
the
deer
the
elephant
the
whale
the
tiger
and
our
other
familiar
mammals
in
some
instances
we
can
trace
the
evolution
with
a
wonderful
fullness
considering
the
remoteness
of
the
period
and
the
conditions
of
preservation
then
one
by
one
the
abortive
the
inelastic
the
types
are
destroyed
by
changing
conditions
or
powerful
carnivores
and
the
field
is
left
to
the
mammals
which
filled
it
when
man
in
turn
began
his
destructive
career
the
first
point
of
interest
is
the
origin
of
these
tertiary
mammals
their
distinctive
advantage
over
the
mammals
of
the
mesozoic
era
possession
by
the
mother
of
a
placenta
the
of
the
higher
mammals
or
structure
in
the
womb
by
which
the
of
the
mother
are
brought
into
such
association
with
those
of
the
foetus
that
her
blood
passes
into
its
arteries
and
it
is
fully
developed
within
the
warm
shelter
of
her
womb
the
mammals
of
the
mesozoic
had
been
small
and
primitive
animals
rarely
larger
than
a
rat
and
never
rising
above
the
marsupial
stage
in
organisation
they
not
only
continued
to
exist
and
give
rise
to
their
modern
representatives
the
opossum
etc
during
the
tertiary
era
but
they
shared
the
general
prosperity
in
australia
where
they
were
protected
from
the
higher
carnivorous
mammals
they
gave
rise
to
huge
wombats
diprotodon
with
skulls
two
or
three
feet
in
length
over
the
earth
generally
however
they
were
superseded
by
the
placental
mammals
which
suddenly
break
into
the
geological
record
in
the
early
tertiary
and
spread
with
great
vigour
and
rapidity
over
the
four
continents
were
they
a
progressive
offshoot
from
the
mesozoic
marsupials
or
monotremes
or
do
they
represent
a
separate
stock
from
the
primitive
and
family
the
point
is
disputed
nor
does
the
scantiness
of
the
record
permit
us
to
tell
the
place
of
their
origin
the
placental
structure
would
be
so
great
an
advantage
in
a
cold
and
unfavourable
environment
that
some
writers
look
to
the
northern
land
connecting
europe
and
america
for
their
development
we
saw
however
that
this
northern
region
was
singularly
warm
until
long
after
the
spread
of
the
mammals
other
experts
impressed
by
the
parallel
development
of
the
mammals
and
the
flowering
plants
look
to
the
elevated
parts
of
eastern
north
america
such
evidence
as
there
is
seems
rather
to
suggest
that
south
africa
was
the
cradle
of
the
placental
mammals
we
shall
find
that
many
of
our
mammals
originated
in
africa
there
too
is
found
the
most
primitive
representative
of
the
tertiary
mammals
the
hyrax
and
there
we
find
in
especial
abundance
the
remains
of
the
reptiles
theromorphs
which
are
regarded
as
their
progenitors
further
search
in
the
unexplored
geological
treasures
and
dense
forests
of
africa
is
needed
we
may
provisionally
conceive
the
placental
mammals
as
a
group
of
the
south
african
early
mammals
which
developed
a
fortunate
variation
in
during
the
severe
conditions
of
the
early
mesozoic
in
this
new
structure
they
would
have
no
preponderant
advantage
as
long
as
the
genial
jurassic
age
favoured
the
great
reptiles
and
they
may
have
remained
as
small
and
insignificant
as
the
marsupials
but
with
the
fresh
upheaval
and
climatic
disturbance
at
the
end
of
the
jurassic
and
during
the
cretaceous
they
spread
northward
and
replaced
the
dying
reptiles
as
the
angiosperms
replaced
the
dying
cycads
when
they
met
the
spread
of
the
angiosperm
vegetation
they
would
receive
another
great
stimulus
to
development
they
appear
in
europe
and
north
america
in
the
earliest
cretaceous
the
rise
of
the
land
had
connected
many
hitherto
isolated
regions
and
they
seem
to
have
poured
over
every
bridge
into
all
parts
of
the
four
continents
the
obscurity
of
their
origin
is
richly
compensated
by
their
intense
evolutionary
interest
from
the
moment
they
enter
the
geological
record
we
have
seen
this
in
the
case
of
every
important
group
of
plants
and
animals
and
can
easily
understand
it
the
ancestral
group
was
small
and
local
the
descendants
are
widely
spread
while
therefore
we
discover
remains
of
the
later
phases
of
development
in
our
casual
cuttings
and
quarries
the
ancestral
tomb
may
remain
for
ages
in
some
unexplored
province
of
the
geological
world
if
this
region
is
as
we
suspect
in
africa
our
failure
to
discover
it
as
yet
is
all
the
more
intelligible
but
these
mammals
of
the
early
tertiary
are
still
of
such
a
patriarchal
or
ancestral
character
that
the
student
of
evolution
can
dispense
with
their
earlier
phase
they
combine
in
their
primitive
frames
in
an
elementary
way
the
features
which
we
now
find
distributed
in
widely
removed
groups
of
their
descendants
most
of
them
fall
into
two
large
orders
the
condylarthra
the
ancestral
herbivores
from
which
we
shall
find
our
horses
oxen
deer
elephants
and
hogs
gradually
issuing
and
the
creodonta
the
patriarchal
carnivores
which
will
give
birth
to
our
lions
and
tigers
wolves
and
foxes
and
their
various
cousins
as
yet
even
the
two
general
types
of
herbivore
and
carnivore
are
so
imperfectly
separated
that
it
is
not
always
possible
to
distinguish
between
them
nearly
all
of
them
have
the
foot
of
the
reptile
ancestor
and
the
flat
nails
on
their
toes
are
the
common
material
out
of
which
the
hoof
of
the
ungulate
and
the
claw
of
the
carnivore
will
be
presently
fashioned
nearly
all
have
simply
constructed
teeth
from
which
will
be
evolved
the
grinders
and
tusks
of
the
elephant
or
the
canines
of
the
tiger
they
answer
in
every
respect
to
the
theory
that
some
primitive
local
group
was
the
common
source
of
all
our
great
mammals
with
them
are
ancestral
forms
of
edentates
sloths
etc
and
insectivores
moles
etc
developing
according
to
their
special
habits
and
before
the
end
of
the
eocene
we
find
primitive
rodents
squirrels
etc
and
cheiroptera
bats
from
the
description
of
the
tertiary
world
which
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
we
understand
the
rapid
evolution
of
the
herbivorous
condylarthra
the
rich
vegetation
which
spreads
over
the
northern
continents
to
which
they
have
penetrated
gives
them
an
enormous
vitality
and
fecundity
and
they
break
into
groups
as
they
increase
in
number
adapted
to
the
different
conditions
of
forest
marsh
or
plain
some
of
them
swelling
lazily
on
the
abundant
food
and
secure
for
a
time
in
their
strength
become
the
deinosaurs
of
their
age
mere
feeding
and
breeding
machines
they
are
massive
sluggish
animals
their
strong
stumpy
limbs
terminating
in
broad
feet
coryphodon
sometimes
as
large
as
an
ox
is
a
typical
representative
it
is
a
type
fitted
only
for
prosperous
days
and
these
amblypoda
as
they
are
called
will
disappear
as
soon
as
the
great
carnivores
are
developed
another
doomed
race
or
abortive
experiment
of
early
mammal
life
were
the
remarkable
deinocerata
mammals
they
sometimes
measured
thirteen
feet
in
length
but
had
little
use
for
brain
in
the
conditions
in
which
they
were
developed
the
brain
of
the
deinoceras
was
only
the
size
of
the
brain
of
a
rhinoceros
of
the
same
bulk
and
the
rhinoceros
is
a
representative
of
the
modern
mammals
to
meet
the
growing
perils
of
their
race
they
seem
to
have
developed
three
pairs
of
horns
on
their
long
flat
skulls
as
we
find
on
them
three
pairs
of
protuberances
a
late
specimen
of
the
group
tinoceras
had
a
head
four
feet
in
length
armed
with
these
six
horns
and
its
canine
teeth
were
developed
into
tusks
sometimes
seven
or
eight
inches
in
length
they
suggest
a
race
of
powerful
but
clumsy
and
grotesque
monsters
making
a
last
stand
and
developing
such
means
of
protection
as
their
inelastic
nature
permitted
but
the
horns
seem
to
have
proved
a
futile
protection
against
the
advancing
carnivores
and
the
race
was
extinguished
the
horns
may
of
course
have
been
mainly
developed
by
or
for
the
mutual
butting
of
the
males
the
extinction
of
these
races
will
remind
many
readers
of
a
theory
on
which
it
is
advisable
to
say
a
word
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
last
of
the
deinosaurs
and
the
ammonites
also
exhibited
some
remarkable
developments
in
their
last
days
these
facts
have
suggested
to
some
writers
the
idea
that
expiring
races
pass
through
a
and
seem
to
die
a
natural
death
of
old
age
like
individuals
the
trilobites
are
quoted
as
another
instance
and
some
ingenious
writers
add
the
supposed
eccentricities
of
the
roman
empire
in
its
senile
decay
and
a
number
of
other
equally
unsubstantial
illustrations
there
is
not
the
least
ground
for
this
fantastic
speculation
the
destruction
of
these
doomed
races
is
as
clearly
traceable
to
external
causes
as
is
the
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
nor
in
fact
did
the
roman
empire
develop
any
such
eccentricities
as
are
imagined
in
this
superficial
theory
what
seem
to
our
eye
the
eccentricities
and
convulsions
of
the
ceratopsia
and
deinocerata
are
much
more
likely
to
be
defensive
developments
against
a
growing
peril
but
they
were
as
futile
against
the
new
carnivores
as
were
the
assegais
of
the
zulus
against
the
european
on
the
other
hand
the
eccentricities
of
many
of
the
later
trilobites
the
latest
trilobites
it
may
be
noted
were
chaste
and
sober
specimens
of
their
race
like
the
last
roman
patricians
and
of
the
ammonites
may
very
well
have
been
caused
by
physical
and
chemical
changes
in
the
we
know
from
experiment
that
such
changes
have
a
disturbing
influence
especially
on
the
development
of
eggs
and
larvae
and
we
know
from
the
geological
record
that
such
changes
occurred
in
the
periods
when
the
trilobites
and
ammonites
perished
in
fine
the
vast
majority
of
extinct
races
passed
through
no
convulsions
whatever
we
may
conclude
that
races
do
not
die
they
are
killed
the
extinction
of
these
races
of
the
early
condylarthra
and
the
survival
of
those
races
whose
descendants
share
the
earth
with
us
are
quite
intelligible
the
hand
of
natural
selection
lay
heavy
on
the
tertiary
herbivores
apart
from
overpopulation
forcing
groups
to
adapt
themselves
to
different
regions
and
diets
and
apart
from
the
geological
disturbances
and
climatic
changes
which
occurred
in
nearly
every
period
the
shadow
of
the
advancing
carnivores
was
upon
them
primitive
but
formidable
tigers
wolves
and
hyenas
were
multiplying
and
a
great
selective
struggle
set
in
some
groups
shrank
from
the
battle
by
burrowing
underground
like
the
rabbit
some
like
the
squirrel
or
the
ape
took
refuge
in
the
trees
some
like
the
whale
and
seal
returned
to
the
water
some
shrank
into
armour
like
the
armadillo
or
behind
fences
of
spines
like
the
hedgehog
some
like
the
bat
escaped
into
the
air
social
life
also
was
probably
developed
at
this
time
and
the
great
herds
had
their
sentinels
and
leaders
but
the
most
useful
qualities
of
the
large
vegetarians
which
lived
on
grass
and
leaf
were
acuteness
of
perception
to
see
the
danger
and
speed
of
limb
to
escape
it
in
other
words
increase
of
brain
and
and
increase
of
speed
were
the
primary
requisites
the
clumsy
early
condylarthra
failed
to
meet
the
tests
and
perished
the
other
branches
of
the
race
were
more
plastic
and
under
the
pressure
of
a
formidable
enemy
were
gradually
moulded
into
the
horse
the
deer
the
ox
the
antelope
and
the
elephant
we
can
follow
the
evolution
of
our
mammals
of
this
branch
most
easily
by
studying
the
modification
of
the
feet
and
limbs
in
a
running
attitude
the
experiment
may
be
tried
the
weight
of
the
body
is
shifted
from
the
flat
sole
of
the
foot
and
thrown
upon
the
toes
especially
the
central
toes
this
indicates
the
line
of
development
of
the
ungulates
hoofed
animals
in
the
struggle
of
the
tertiary
era
in
the
early
eocene
we
find
the
condylarthra
such
as
phenacodus
with
flat
feet
and
such
a
mixed
combination
of
characters
that
they
might
serve
very
well
for
the
ancestors
of
all
the
later
ungulata
woodward
we
then
presently
find
this
generalised
ungulate
branching
into
three
types
one
of
which
seems
to
be
a
patriarchal
tapir
the
second
is
regarded
as
a
very
remote
ancestor
of
the
horse
and
the
third
foreshadows
the
rhinoceros
the
feet
have
now
only
three
or
four
toes
one
or
two
of
the
have
disappeared
this
evolution
however
follows
two
distinct
lines
in
one
group
of
these
primitive
ungulates
the
main
axis
of
the
limb
or
the
stress
of
the
weight
passes
through
the
middle
toe
this
group
becomes
the
perissodactyla
ungulates
of
the
zoologist
throwing
out
in
the
tapir
and
the
rhinoceros
and
culminating
in
the
horse
in
the
other
line
the
artiodactyla
the
or
ungulates
the
main
axis
or
stress
passes
between
the
third
and
fourth
toes
and
the
group
branches
into
our
deer
oxen
sheep
pigs
camels
giraffes
and
hippopotamuses
the
elephant
has
developed
along
a
separate
and
very
distinctive
line
as
we
shall
see
and
the
hyrax
is
a
primitive
survivor
of
the
ancestral
group
thus
the
evolutionist
is
able
to
trace
a
very
natural
order
in
the
immense
variety
of
our
ungulates
he
can
follow
them
in
theory
as
they
slowly
evolve
from
their
primitive
eocene
ancestor
according
to
their
various
habits
and
environments
he
has
a
very
rich
collection
of
fossil
remains
illustrating
the
stages
of
their
development
and
in
the
hyrax
or
coney
he
has
one
more
of
those
living
fossils
or
primitive
survivors
which
still
fairly
preserve
the
ancestral
form
the
hyrax
has
four
toes
on
the
front
foot
and
three
on
the
hind
foot
and
the
feet
are
flat
its
front
teeth
resemble
those
of
a
rodent
and
its
molars
those
of
the
rhinoceros
in
many
respects
it
is
a
most
primitive
and
generalised
little
animal
preserving
the
ancestral
form
more
or
less
faithfully
since
tertiary
days
in
the
shelter
of
the
african
continent
the
rest
of
the
ungulates
continued
to
develop
through
the
tertiary
and
fortunately
we
are
enabled
to
follow
the
development
of
two
of
the
most
interesting
of
them
the
horse
and
the
elephant
in
considerable
detail
as
i
said
above
the
primitive
ungulate
soon
branches
into
three
types
which
dimly
foreshadow
the
tapir
the
horse
and
the
rhinoceros
the
three
forms
of
the
perissodactyl
the
second
of
these
types
is
the
hyracotherium
it
has
no
distinct
equine
features
and
is
known
only
from
the
skull
but
the
authorities
regard
it
as
the
progenitor
or
representative
of
the
progenitors
of
the
in
size
it
must
have
been
something
like
the
rabbit
or
the
hyrax
still
early
in
the
eocene
however
we
find
the
remains
of
a
small
animal
eohippus
about
the
size
of
a
fox
which
is
described
as
undoubtedly
it
had
only
three
toes
on
its
hind
feet
and
four
on
its
front
feet
though
it
had
also
a
representing
the
shrunken
and
discarded
fifth
toe
on
its
fore
feet
another
form
of
the
same
period
protorohippus
shows
the
central
of
the
three
toes
on
the
hind
foot
much
enlarged
and
the
lateral
toes
shrinking
the
teeth
and
the
bones
and
joints
of
the
limbs
are
also
developing
in
the
direction
of
the
horse
in
the
succeeding
geological
period
the
oligocene
we
find
several
in
which
the
adaptation
of
the
limbs
to
running
on
the
firm
grassy
plains
and
of
the
teeth
to
eating
the
grass
continues
mesohippus
has
lost
the
fourth
toe
of
the
fore
foot
which
is
now
reduced
to
a
splintbone
and
the
lateral
toes
of
its
hind
foot
are
shrinking
in
the
miocene
period
there
is
a
great
development
of
the
mammals
we
have
the
remains
of
more
than
forty
species
some
continuing
the
main
line
of
development
on
the
firm
and
growing
prairies
of
the
miocene
some
branching
into
the
softer
meadows
or
the
forests
and
giving
rise
to
types
which
will
not
outlive
the
tertiary
they
have
three
toes
on
each
foot
and
have
generally
lost
even
the
rudimentary
trace
of
the
fourth
toe
in
most
of
them
moreover
the
lateral
toes
except
in
the
species
with
spreading
feet
scarcely
touch
the
ground
while
the
central
toe
is
developing
a
strong
hoof
the
are
longer
and
have
a
new
type
of
joint
the
muscles
are
concentrated
near
the
body
the
front
teeth
are
now
chopping
incisors
and
the
grinding
teeth
approach
those
of
the
modern
horse
in
the
distribution
of
the
enamel
dentine
and
cement
they
are
now
about
the
size
of
a
donkey
and
must
have
had
a
distinctly
horsy
appearance
with
their
long
necks
and
heads
and
tapering
limbs
one
of
them
merychippus
was
probably
in
the
direct
line
of
the
evolution
of
the
horse
from
hipparion
some
of
the
authorities
believe
that
the
zebras
may
have
been
developed
miohippus
protohippus
and
hypohippus
varying
in
size
from
that
of
a
sheep
to
that
of
a
donkey
are
other
branches
of
this
spreading
family
in
the
pliocene
period
the
evolution
of
the
main
stem
culminates
in
the
appearance
of
the
horse
and
the
collateral
branches
are
destroyed
pliohippus
is
a
further
intermediate
form
it
has
only
one
toe
on
each
foot
with
two
large
splint
bones
but
its
hoof
is
less
round
than
that
of
the
horse
and
it
differs
in
the
shape
of
the
skull
and
the
length
of
the
teeth
the
true
horse
equus
at
length
appears
in
europe
and
america
before
the
close
of
the
tertiary
period
as
is
well
known
it
still
has
the
rudimentary
traces
of
its
second
and
fourth
toes
in
the
shape
of
splint
bones
and
these
bones
are
not
only
more
definitely
in
the
foal
before
birth
but
are
occasionally
developed
and
give
us
a
horse
from
these
successive
remains
we
can
confidently
picture
the
evolution
during
two
or
three
million
years
of
one
of
our
most
familiar
mammals
it
must
not
of
course
be
supposed
that
these
fossil
remains
all
represent
ancestors
of
the
horse
in
some
cases
they
may
very
well
do
so
in
others
as
we
saw
they
represent
sidebranches
of
the
family
which
have
become
extinct
but
even
such
successive
forms
as
the
eohippus
mesohippus
miohippus
and
pliohippus
must
not
be
arranged
in
a
direct
line
as
the
pedigree
of
the
horse
the
family
became
most
extensive
in
the
miocene
and
we
must
regard
the
casual
fossil
specimens
we
have
discovered
as
illustrations
of
the
various
phases
in
the
development
of
the
horse
from
the
primitive
ungulate
when
we
recollect
what
we
saw
in
an
earlier
chapter
about
the
evolution
of
grassy
plains
and
the
successive
rises
of
the
land
during
the
tertiary
period
and
when
we
reflect
on
the
simultaneous
advance
of
the
carnivores
we
can
without
difficulty
realise
this
evolution
of
our
familiar
companion
from
a
little
animal
of
two
million
years
ago
we
have
not
in
many
cases
so
rich
a
collection
of
intermediate
forms
as
in
the
case
of
the
horse
but
our
fossil
mammals
are
numerous
enough
to
suggest
a
similar
development
of
all
the
mammals
of
the
primitive
family
which
gave
birth
to
the
horse
also
gave
us
as
we
saw
the
tapir
and
the
rhinoceros
we
find
ancestral
tapirs
in
europe
and
america
during
the
tertiary
period
but
the
later
cold
has
driven
them
to
the
warm
swamps
of
brazil
and
malaysia
the
rhinoceros
has
had
a
long
and
interesting
history
from
the
primitive
hyrochinus
of
the
eocene
in
which
it
is
dimly
foreshadowed
we
pass
to
a
large
and
varied
family
in
the
later
periods
in
the
oligocene
it
spreads
into
three
great
branches
adapted
respectively
to
life
on
the
elevated
lands
the
lowlands
and
the
water
the
upland
type
hyracodon
was
a
running
animal
well
illustrating
the
close
relation
to
the
horse
the
aquatic
representative
metamynodon
was
a
stumpy
and
bulky
animal
the
intermediate
lowland
type
was
probably
the
ancestor
of
the
modern
animal
all
three
forms
were
yet
hornless
in
the
miocene
the
lowland
type
leptaceratherium
aceratherium
etc
develops
vigorously
while
the
other
branches
die
the
european
types
now
have
two
horns
and
in
one
of
the
american
species
diceratherium
we
see
a
commencement
of
the
horny
growths
from
the
skull
we
shall
see
later
that
the
rhinoceros
continued
in
europe
even
during
the
severe
conditions
of
the
glacial
period
in
a
branch
that
developed
a
woolly
coat
there
were
also
in
the
early
tertiary
several
sidebranches
of
the
family
the
palaeotheres
were
more
or
less
between
the
horse
and
the
tapir
in
structure
the
anoplotheres
between
the
tapir
and
the
ruminant
a
third
doomed
branch
the
titanotheres
flourished
vigorously
for
a
time
and
begot
some
strange
and
monstrous
forms
brontops
titanops
in
the
larger
specimens
the
body
was
about
fourteen
feet
long
and
stood
ten
feet
from
the
ground
the
long
low
skull
had
a
pair
of
horns
over
the
snout
they
perished
like
the
equally
powerful
but
equally
sluggish
and
stupid
deinocerata
the
tertiary
was
an
age
of
brain
rather
than
of
brawn
as
compared
with
their
early
tertiary
representatives
some
of
our
modern
mammals
have
increased
seven
or
in
while
the
horses
and
tapirs
and
rhinoceroses
were
being
gradually
evolved
from
the
primitive
types
the
artiodactyl
branch
of
the
ungulates
the
pigs
deer
oxen
were
also
developing
we
must
dismiss
them
briefly
we
saw
that
the
primitive
herbivores
divided
early
in
the
eocene
into
the
and
varieties
the
name
refers
it
will
be
remembered
not
to
the
number
of
toes
but
to
the
axis
of
stress
the
artiodactyl
group
must
have
quickly
branched
in
turn
as
we
find
very
primitive
hogs
and
camels
before
the
end
of
the
eocene
the
first
creature
homacodon
was
much
smaller
than
the
hog
of
and
had
strong
canine
teeth
but
in
the
oligocene
the
family
gave
rise
to
a
large
and
numerous
race
the
elotheres
these
as
they
have
been
called
with
two
toes
on
each
foot
flourished
vigorously
for
a
time
in
europe
and
america
but
were
extinguished
in
the
miocene
when
the
true
pigs
made
their
appearance
another
doomed
race
of
the
time
is
represented
by
the
hyopotamus
an
animal
between
the
pig
and
the
hippopotamus
and
the
oreodontids
between
the
hog
and
the
deer
were
another
unsuccessful
branch
of
the
early
race
the
hippopotamus
itself
was
widespread
in
europe
and
a
familiar
form
in
the
rivers
of
britain
in
the
latter
part
of
the
tertiary
the
camel
seems
to
be
traceable
to
a
group
of
primitive
north
american
ungulates
paebrotherium
etc
in
the
later
eocene
period
the
paebrotherium
a
small
animal
about
two
feet
long
is
followed
by
pliauchenia
which
points
toward
the
llamas
and
vicunas
and
procamelus
which
clearly
foreshadows
the
true
camel
in
the
pliocene
the
one
branch
went
southward
to
develop
into
the
llamas
and
vicunas
and
the
other
branch
crossed
to
asia
to
develop
into
the
camels
since
that
time
they
have
had
no
descendants
in
north
america
the
primitive
giraffe
appears
suddenly
in
the
later
tertiary
deposits
of
europe
and
asia
the
evidence
points
to
an
invasion
from
africa
and
as
the
region
of
development
is
unknown
and
unexplored
the
evolution
of
the
giraffe
remains
a
matter
of
speculation
chevrotains
flourished
in
europe
and
north
america
in
the
oligocene
and
are
still
very
primitive
in
structure
combining
features
of
the
hog
and
the
ruminants
primitive
deer
and
oxen
begin
in
the
miocene
and
seem
to
have
an
earlier
representative
in
certain
american
animals
protoceras
of
which
the
male
has
a
pair
of
blunt
outgrowths
between
the
ears
the
first
true
deer
are
hornless
like
the
primitive
muskdeer
of
asia
but
by
the
middle
of
the
miocene
the
males
have
small
antlers
and
as
the
period
proceeds
three
or
four
more
prongs
are
added
it
is
some
confirmation
of
the
evolutionary
embryonic
law
that
we
find
the
antlers
developing
in
this
way
in
the
individual
stag
a
very
curious
race
of
ruminants
in
the
later
tertiary
was
a
large
antelope
sivatherium
with
four
horns
it
had
not
only
the
dimensions
but
apparently
some
of
the
characters
of
an
elephant
the
elephant
itself
the
last
type
of
the
ungulates
has
a
clearer
line
of
developments
a
chance
discovery
of
fossils
in
the
fayum
district
in
egypt
led
andrews
to
make
a
special
exploration
and
on
the
remains
which
he
found
he
has
constructed
a
remarkable
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
elephant
it
is
clear
that
the
elephant
was
developed
in
africa
and
a
sufficiently
complete
series
of
remains
has
been
found
to
give
a
good
idea
of
the
origin
of
its
most
distinctive
features
in
the
eocene
period
there
lived
in
the
egyptian
region
an
animal
something
like
the
tapir
in
size
and
appearance
which
had
its
second
incisors
developed
into
small
tusks
and
to
judge
from
the
nasal
opening
in
the
skull
a
somewhat
prolonged
snout
this
animal
moeritherium
only
differed
from
the
ordinary
primitive
ungulate
in
these
incipient
elephantine
features
in
the
later
eocene
a
larger
and
more
advanced
animal
the
palaeomastodon
makes
its
appearance
its
tusks
are
larger
five
or
six
inches
long
its
molars
more
elephantine
the
at
the
back
of
the
head
more
developed
it
would
look
like
a
small
elephant
except
that
it
had
a
long
snout
instead
of
a
flexible
trunk
and
a
projecting
lower
jaw
on
which
the
snout
rested
this
short
account
guide
to
the
elephants
in
the
british
museum
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
miocene
africa
was
as
we
saw
cut
off
from
europe
and
asia
by
the
sea
which
stretched
from
spain
to
india
then
the
land
rose
and
the
elephant
passed
by
the
new
tracts
into
the
north
its
next
representative
tetrabelodon
is
found
in
asia
and
europe
as
well
as
north
africa
the
frame
is
as
large
as
that
of
a
elephant
and
the
increase
of
the
at
the
back
of
the
skull
shows
that
an
increased
weight
has
to
be
sustained
by
the
muscles
of
the
neck
the
nostrils
are
shifted
further
back
the
tusks
are
from
twenty
to
thirty
inches
long
and
round
and
only
differ
from
those
of
the
elephant
in
curving
slightly
downward
the
chin
projects
as
far
as
the
tusks
the
neck
is
shorter
and
thicker
and
as
the
animal
increases
in
height
we
can
understand
that
the
long
snout
possibly
prehensile
at
its
lower
end
is
necessary
for
the
animal
to
reach
the
ground
but
the
snout
still
lies
on
the
projecting
lower
jaw
and
is
not
a
trunk
passing
over
the
many
collateral
branches
which
diverge
in
various
directions
we
next
kind
that
the
chin
is
shortening
in
tetrabelodon
longirostris
and
through
a
long
series
of
discovered
intermediate
forms
we
trace
the
evolution
of
the
elephant
from
the
mastodon
the
long
supporting
skin
disappears
and
the
enormous
snout
becomes
a
flexible
trunk
southern
asia
seems
to
have
been
the
province
of
this
final
transformation
and
we
have
remains
of
some
of
these
primitive
elephants
with
tusks
nine
and
a
half
feet
long
a
later
species
which
wandered
over
central
and
southern
europe
before
the
close
of
the
tertiary
stood
fifteen
feet
high
at
the
shoulder
while
the
mammoth
which
superseded
it
in
the
days
of
early
man
had
at
times
tusks
more
than
ten
feet
in
length
it
is
interesting
to
reflect
that
this
light
on
the
evolution
of
one
of
our
most
specialised
mammals
is
due
to
the
chance
opening
of
the
soil
in
an
obscure
african
region
it
suggests
to
us
that
as
geological
exploration
is
extended
many
similar
discoveries
may
be
made
the
slenderness
of
the
geological
record
is
a
defect
that
the
future
may
considerably
modify
from
this
summary
review
of
the
evolution
of
the
ungulates
we
must
now
pass
to
an
even
briefer
account
of
the
evolution
of
the
carnivores
the
evidence
is
less
abundant
but
the
characters
of
the
carnivores
consist
so
obviously
of
adaptations
to
their
habits
and
diet
that
we
have
little
difficulty
in
imagining
their
evolution
their
early
eocene
ancestors
the
creodonts
gave
rise
in
the
eocene
to
forms
which
we
may
regard
as
the
forerunners
of
the
and
to
which
most
of
our
familiar
carnivores
belong
patriofelis
the
patriarchal
cat
about
five
or
six
feet
in
length
without
the
tail
curiously
combines
the
features
of
the
cat
and
the
cyonodon
has
a
appearance
and
amphicyon
rather
suggests
the
fox
primitive
weasels
civets
and
hyaenas
appear
also
in
the
eocene
the
various
branches
of
the
carnivore
family
are
already
roughly
represented
but
it
is
an
age
of
close
relationships
and
generalised
characters
in
the
miocene
we
find
the
various
groups
diverging
still
further
from
each
other
and
from
the
extinct
stocks
definite
wolves
and
foxes
abound
in
america
and
the
bear
civet
and
hyaena
are
represented
in
europe
together
with
vague
forms
the
seems
to
have
developed
chiefly
in
north
america
as
in
the
case
of
the
ungulates
we
find
many
strange
which
flourished
for
a
time
but
are
unknown
machoerodus
usually
known
as
the
tiger
though
not
a
tiger
was
one
of
the
most
formidable
of
these
transitory
races
its
upper
canine
teeth
the
sabres
were
several
inches
in
length
and
it
had
enormously
distensible
jaws
to
make
them
effective
the
great
development
of
such
animals
with
large
numbers
of
hyaenas
civets
wolves
bears
and
other
carnivores
in
the
middle
and
later
tertiary
was
probably
the
most
effective
agency
in
the
evolution
of
the
horse
and
deer
and
the
extinction
of
the
more
sluggish
races
the
aquatic
branch
of
the
carnivores
seals
walruses
etc
is
little
represented
in
the
tertiary
record
we
saw
however
that
the
most
primitive
representatives
of
the
had
also
some
characters
of
the
seal
and
it
is
thought
that
the
two
had
a
common
origin
the
moeritherium
was
a
and
may
very
well
have
been
cousin
to
the
branch
of
the
family
which
pushed
on
to
the
seas
and
developed
its
fore
limbs
into
paddles
the
rodents
are
represented
in
primitive
form
early
in
the
eocene
period
the
teeth
are
just
beginning
to
show
the
characteristic
modification
for
gnawing
a
large
branch
of
the
family
the
tillodonts
attained
some
importance
a
little
later
they
are
described
as
combining
the
head
and
claws
of
a
bear
with
the
teeth
of
a
rodent
and
the
general
characters
of
an
ungulate
in
the
oligocene
we
find
primitive
squirrels
beavers
rabbits
and
mice
the
insectivores
also
developed
some
of
the
present
types
at
an
early
date
and
have
since
proved
so
unprogressive
that
some
regard
them
as
the
stock
from
which
all
the
placental
mammals
have
arisen
the
cetacea
whales
porpoises
etc
are
already
represented
in
the
eocene
by
a
primitive
animal
zeuglodon
of
unknown
origin
some
specimens
of
it
are
seventy
feet
in
length
it
has
large
teeth
sometimes
six
inches
long
and
is
clearly
a
terrestrial
mammal
that
has
returned
to
the
waters
some
forms
even
of
the
modern
whale
develop
rudimentary
teeth
and
in
all
forms
the
bony
structure
of
the
fore
limbs
and
degenerate
relic
of
a
pelvis
and
back
limbs
plainly
tell
of
the
terrestrial
origin
dolphins
appear
in
the
miocene
finally
the
edentates
sloths
anteaters
and
armadilloes
are
represented
in
a
very
primitive
form
in
the
early
eocene
they
are
then
barely
distinguishable
from
the
condylarthra
and
creodonta
and
seem
only
recently
to
have
issued
from
a
common
ancestor
with
those
groups
in
the
course
of
the
tertiary
we
find
them
especially
in
south
america
which
was
cut
off
from
the
north
and
its
invading
carnivores
during
the
eocene
and
miocene
developed
into
large
sloths
armadilloes
and
anteaters
the
reconnection
with
north
america
in
the
pliocene
allowed
the
northern
animals
to
descend
but
gigantic
sloths
megatherium
and
armadilloes
glyptodon
flourished
long
afterwards
in
south
america
the
megatherium
attained
a
length
of
eighteen
feet
in
one
specimen
discovered
and
the
glyptodon
often
had
a
dorsal
shield
like
that
of
the
armadillo
from
six
to
eight
feet
long
and
in
addition
a
stoutly
armoured
tail
several
feet
long
the
richness
and
rapidity
of
the
mammalian
development
in
the
tertiary
of
which
this
condensed
survey
will
convey
some
impression
make
it
impossible
to
do
more
here
than
glance
over
the
vast
field
and
indicate
the
connections
it
will
be
seen
that
evolution
not
only
introduces
a
lucid
order
and
arrangement
into
our
thousands
of
species
of
living
and
fossil
mammals
but
throws
an
admirable
light
on
the
higher
animal
world
of
our
time
the
various
orders
into
which
the
zoologist
puts
our
mammals
are
seen
to
be
the
branches
of
a
living
tree
approaching
more
and
more
closely
to
each
other
in
early
tertiary
times
in
spite
of
the
imperfectness
of
the
geological
record
we
at
last
trace
these
diverging
lines
to
a
few
very
primitive
generalised
patriarchal
groups
which
in
turn
approach
each
other
very
closely
in
structure
and
plainly
suggest
a
common
cretaceous
ancestor
whether
that
common
ancestor
was
an
edentate
an
insectivore
or
creodont
or
something
more
primitive
than
them
all
is
disputed
but
the
divergence
of
nearly
all
the
lines
of
our
mammal
world
from
those
patriarchal
types
is
admirably
clear
in
the
mutual
struggle
of
carnivore
and
herbivore
in
adaptation
to
a
hundred
different
environments
the
water
the
land
and
the
air
the
tree
the
open
plain
the
underground
the
marsh
etc
and
forms
of
diet
we
find
the
descendants
of
these
patriarchal
animals
gradually
developing
their
distinctive
characters
then
we
find
the
destructive
agencies
of
living
and
inorganic
nature
blotting
out
type
after
type
and
the
living
things
that
spread
over
the
land
in
the
later
tertiary
are
found
to
be
broadly
identical
with
the
living
things
of
the
last
great
selection
the
northern

give
the
last
touches
of

chapter
xviii
the
evolution
of
man
we
have
reserved
for
a
closer
inquiry
that
order
of
the
placental
mammals
to
which
we
ourselves
belong
and
on
which
zoologists
have
bestowed
the
very
proper
and
distinguishing
name
of
the
primates
since
the
days
of
darwin
there
has
been
some
tendency
to
resent
the
term
lower
animals
which
man
applies
to
his
poorer
relations
but
though
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
standard
by
which
we
may
judge
the
higher
or
lower
status
of
animals
or
plants
the
extraordinary
power
which
man
has
by
his
brain
development
attained
over
both
animate
and
inanimate
nature
fully
justifies
the
phrase
the
primate
order
is
therefore
of
supreme
interest
as
the
family
that
gave
birth
to
man
and
it
is
important
to
discover
the
agencies
which
impelled
some
primitive
member
of
it
to
enter
upon
the
path
which
led
to
this
summit
of
organic
nature
the
order
includes
the
femurs
a
large
and
primitive
family
with
features
the
germans
call
them
the
monkeys
the
apes
and
man
this
classification
according
to
structure
corresponds
with
the
successive
appearance
of
the
various
families
in
the
geological
record
the
femurs
appear
in
the
eocene
the
monkeys
and
afterwards
the
apes
in
the
miocene
the
first
forms
in
the
pleistocene
though
they
must
have
been
developed
before
this
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
science
does
not
regard
man
as
a
descendant
of
the
known
anthropoid
apes
or
these
as
descended
from
the
monkeys
they
are
successive
types
or
phases
of
development
diverging
early
from
each
other
just
as
the
succeeding
of
the
record
are
not
necessarily
related
to
each
other
in
a
direct
line
yet
illustrate
the
evolution
of
a
type
which
culminates
in
the
horse
so
the
spreading
and
branching
members
of
the
primate
group
illustrate
the
evolution
of
a
type
of
organism
which
culminates
in
man
the
particular
relationship
of
the
various
families
living
and
dead
will
need
careful
study
that
there
is
a
general
and
that
man
is
much
more
closely
related
to
the
anthropoid
apes
than
to
any
of
the
lower
primates
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
controversy
in
rudolph
virchow
there
died
a
few
years
ago
the
last
authoritative
man
of
science
to
express
any
doubt
about
it
there
are
however
writers
who
by
repeating
the
ambiguous
phrase
that
it
is
only
a
theory
convey
the
impression
to
inexpert
readers
that
it
is
still
more
or
less
an
open
question
we
will
therefore
indicate
a
few
of
the
lines
of
evidence
which
have
overcome
the
last
hesitations
of
scientific
men
and
closed
the
discussion
as
to
the
fact
the
very
close
analogy
of
structure
between
man
and
the
ape
at
once
suggests
that
they
had
a
common
ancestor
there
are
cases
in
which
two
widely
removed
animals
may
develop
a
similar
organ
independently
but
there
is
assuredly
no
possibility
of
their
being
alike
in
all
organs
unless
by
common
inheritance
yet
the
essential
identity
of
structure
in
man
and
the
ape
is
only
confirmed
by
every
advance
of
science
and
would
of
itself
prove
the
common
parentage
such
minor
differences
as
there
are
between
man
and
the
higher
ape
in
the
development
of
the
cerebrum
the
number
of
the
teeth
or
ribs
the
distribution
of
the
hair
and
so
on
are
quite
explicable
when
we
reflect
that
the
two
groups
must
have
diverged
from
each
other
more
than
a
million
years
ago
examining
the
structure
of
man
more
closely
we
find
this
strong
suggestion
of
relationship
greatly
confirmed
it
is
now
well
known
that
the
human
body
contains
a
number
of
vestigial
organs
organs
of
no
actual
use
and
only
intelligible
as
vestiges
of
organs
that
were
once
useful
whatever
view
we
take
of
the
origin
of
man
each
organ
in
his
frame
must
have
a
meaning
and
as
these
organs
are
vestigial
and
useless
even
in
the
lowest
tribes
of
men
who
represent
primitive
man
they
must
be
vestiges
of
organs
that
were
of
use
in
a
remote
ancestor
the
one
fact
that
the
ape
has
the
same
vestigial
organs
as
man
would
on
a
scientific
standard
of
evidence
prove
the
common
descent
of
the
two
but
these
interesting
organs
themselves
point
back
far
earlier
than
a
mixed
ancestor
in
many
cases
the
shell
of
cartilage
which
covers
the
entrance
to
the
ear
the
gristly
appendage
which
is
popularly
called
the
ear
is
one
of
the
clearest
and
most
easily
recognised
of
these
organs
the
ear
of
a
horse
or
a
cat
is
an
upright
mobile
shell
for
catching
the
waves
of
sound
the
human
ear
has
the
appearance
of
being
the
shrunken
relic
of
such
an
organ
and
when
we
remove
the
skin
and
find
seven
generally
useless
muscles
attached
to
it
obviously
intended
to
pull
the
shell
in
all
directions
as
in
the
horse
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
external
ear
is
a
discarded
organ
a
useless
legacy
from
an
earlier
ancestor
in
cases
where
it
has
been
cut
off
it
was
found
that
the
sense
of
hearing
was
scarcely
if
at
all
affected
now
we
know
that
it
is
similarly
useless
in
all
tribes
of
men
and
must
therefore
come
from
a
ancestor
it
is
also
vestigial
in
the
higher
apes
and
it
is
only
when
we
descend
to
the
lower
monkeys
and
femurs
that
we
see
it
approaching
its
primitive
useful
form
one
may
almost
say
that
it
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
period
when
probably
in
the
early
tertiary
the
ancestors
of
the
primates
took
to
the
trees
the
animals
living
on
the
plain
needed
acute
senses
to
detect
the
approach
of
their
prey
or
their
enemies
the
found
less
demand
on
his
sense
of
hearing
the
was
discarded
and
the
development
of
the
internal
ear
proceeded
on
the
higher
line
of
the
perception
of
musical
sounds
we
might
take
a
very
large
number
of
parts
of
the
actual
human
body
and
discover
that
they
are
similar
historical
or
archaeological
monuments
surviving
in
a
modern
system
but
we
have
space
only
for
a
few
of
the
more
conspicuous
the
hair
on
the
body
is
a
vestigial
organ
of
actual
use
to
no
race
of
men
an
evident
relic
of
the
thick
warm
coat
of
an
earlier
ancestor
it
in
turn
recalls
the
dwellers
in
the
primeval
forest
in
most
cases
not
all
because
the
wearing
of
clothes
for
ages
has
modified
this
feature
it
will
be
found
that
the
hairs
on
the
arm
tend
upward
from
the
wrist
to
the
elbow
and
downward
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
this
very
peculiar
feature
becomes
intelligible
when
we
find
that
some
of
the
apes
also
have
it
and
that
it
has
a
certain
use
in
their
case
they
put
their
hands
over
their
heads
as
they
sit
in
the
trees
during
ram
and
in
that
position
the
sloping
hair
acts
somewhat
like
the
thatched
roof
of
a
cottage
again
it
will
be
found
that
in
the
natural
position
of
standing
we
are
not
perfectly
but
tend
to
press
much
more
on
the
outer
than
on
the
inner
edge
of
the
foot
this
tendency
surviving
after
ages
of
living
on
the
level
ground
is
a
lingering
effect
of
the
arboreal
days
a
more
curious
reminiscence
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
very
young
infant
flabby
and
powerless
as
it
is
in
most
of
its
muscles
is
so
strong
in
the
muscles
of
the
hand
and
arm
that
it
can
hang
on
to
a
stick
by
its
hands
and
sustain
the
whole
weight
of
its
body
for
several
minutes
finally
our
vestigial
tail
for
we
have
a
tail
comparable
to
that
of
the
higher
apes
must
be
mentioned
in
embryonic
development
the
tail
is
much
longer
than
the
legs
and
some
children
are
born
with
a
real
tail
which
they
move
as
the
puppy
does
according
to
their
emotional
condition
other
features
of
the
body
point
back
to
an
even
earlier
stage
the
vermiform
appendage
in
which
some
recent
medical
writers
have
vainly
endeavoured
to
find
a
utility
is
the
shrunken
remainder
of
a
large
and
normal
intestine
of
a
remote
ancestor
this
interpretation
of
it
would
stand
even
if
it
were
found
to
have
a
certain
use
in
the
human
body
vestigial
organs
are
sometimes
pressed
into
a
secondary
use
when
their
original
function
has
been
lost
the
danger
of
this
appendage
in
the
human
body
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
blind
alley
leading
off
the
alimentary
canal
and
has
a
very
narrow
opening
in
the
ape
the
opening
is
larger
and
significantly
enough
it
is
still
larger
in
the
human
foetus
when
we
examine
some
of
the
lower
mammals
we
discover
the
meaning
of
it
it
is
in
them
an
additional
storage
chamber
in
the
alimentary
system
it
is
believed
that
a
change
to
a
more
digestible
diet
has
made
this
additional
chamber
superfluous
in
the
primates
and
the
system
is
slowly
suppressing
it
other
reminiscences
of
this
earlier
phase
are
found
in
the
many
vestigial
muscles
which
are
found
in
the
body
the
head
of
the
quadruped
hangs
forward
and
is
held
by
powerful
muscles
and
ligaments
in
the
neck
we
still
have
the
shrunken
remainder
of
this
arrangement
other
vestigial
muscles
are
found
in
the
forehead
the
scalp
the
nose
many
people
can
twitch
the
nostrils
and
the
scalp
and
under
the
skin
in
many
parts
of
the
body
these
are
enfeebled
remnants
of
the
muscular
coat
by
which
the
quadruped
twitches
its
skin
and
drives
insects
away
a
less
obvious
feature
is
found
by
the
anatomist
in
certain
of
the
trunk
as
the
blood
flows
vertically
in
a
biped
and
horizontally
in
a
quadruped
the
arrangement
of
the
valves
in
the
should
be
different
in
the
two
cases
but
it
is
the
same
in
us
as
in
the
quadruped
another
trace
of
the
quadruped
ancestor
is
found
in
the
baby
it
walks
on
all
fours
so
long
not
merely
from
weakness
of
the
limbs
but
because
it
has
the
spine
of
a
quadruped
a
much
more
interesting
fact
but
one
less
easy
to
interpret
is
that
the
human
male
has
like
the
male
ape
organs
for
suckling
the
young
that
there
are
real
usually
vestigial
underneath
the
teats
in
the
breast
of
the
boy
or
the
man
is
proved
by
the
many
known
cases
in
which
men
have
suckled
the
young
several
friends
of
the
present
writer
have
seen
this
done
in
india
and
ceylon
by
male
as
there
is
no
tribe
of
men
or
species
of
ape
in
which
the
male
suckles
the
young
normally
we
seem
to
be
thrown
back
once
more
upon
an
earlier
ancestor
the
difficulty
is
that
we
know
of
no
mammal
of
which
both
parents
suckle
the
young
and
some
authorities
think
that
the
breasts
have
been
transferred
to
the
male
by
a
kind
of
embryonic
muddle
that
is
difficult
to
believe
as
no
other
feature
has
ever
been
similarly
transferred
to
the
opposite
sex
in
any
case
the
male
breasts
are
vestigial
organs
another
peculiarity
of
the
mammary
system
is
that
sometimes
three
four
or
five
pairs
of
breasts
appear
in
a
woman
and
several
have
been
known
even
in
a
man
this
is
apparently
an
occasional
reminiscence
of
an
early
mammal
ancestor
which
had
large
litters
of
young
and
several
pairs
of
breasts
but
there
are
features
of
the
human
body
which
recall
an
ancestor
even
earlier
than
the
quadruped
the
most
conspicuous
of
these
is
the
little
fleshy
pad
at
the
inner
corner
of
each
eye
it
is
a
common
feature
in
mammals
and
is
always
useless
when
however
we
look
lower
down
in
the
animal
scale
we
find
that
fishes
and
reptiles
and
birds
have
a
third
eyelid
which
is
drawn
across
the
eye
from
this
corner
there
is
little
room
to
doubt
that
the
little
fleshy
vestige
in
the
mammal
eye
is
the
shrunken
remainder
of
the
lateral
eyelid
of
a
remote
a
similar
reminiscence
is
found
in
the
pineal
body
a
small
and
useless
object
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
in
the
centre
of
the
brain
when
we
examine
the
reptile
we
find
a
third
eye
in
the
top
of
the
head
the
skin
has
closed
over
it
but
the
skull
is
still
in
many
cases
perforated
as
it
is
for
the
eyes
in
front
i
have
seen
it
standing
out
like
a
ball
on
the
head
of
a
dead
crocodile
and
in
the
living
tuatara
the
very
primitive
new
zealand
lizard
it
still
has
a
retina
and
optic
nerve
as
the
only
animal
in
nature
with
an
eye
in
this
position
the
pyrosome
a
little
marine
animal
of
the
family
is
not
in
the
line
of
reptile
and
mammal
ancestry
it
is
difficult
to
locate
the
third
eye
definitely
but
when
we
find
the
skin
closing
over
it
in
the
amphibian
and
reptile
then
the
bone
and
then
see
it
gradually
atrophying
and
being
buried
under
the
growing
brain
we
must
refer
it
to
some
early
this
ancestor
we
may
recall
is
also
reflected
for
a
time
in
the
and
arches
with
their
corresponding
heart
and
during
man
embryonic
development
as
we
saw
in
a
former
chapter
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
more
conspicuous
instances
of
vestigial
structures
in
man
metchnikoff
describes
about
a
hundred
of
them
even
if
there
were
no
remains
of
primitive
man
pointing
in
the
direction
of
a
common
ancestry
with
the
ape
no
lower
types
of
men
in
existence
with
the
same
tendency
no
apes
found
in
nature
with
a
structure
so
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
man
and
no
fossil
records
telling
of
the
divergence
of
forms
from
primitive
groups
in
past
time
we
should
be
forced
to
postulate
the
evolution
of
man
in
order
to
explain
his
actual
features
the
vestigial
structures
must
be
interpreted
as
we
interpret
the
buttons
on
the
back
of
a
man
coat
they
are
useless
reminiscences
of
an
age
in
which
they
were
useful
when
their
witness
to
the
past
is
supported
by
so
many
converging
lines
of
evidence
it
becomes
irresistible
i
will
add
only
one
further
testimony
which
has
been
brought
into
court
in
recent
years
the
blood
consists
of
cells
or
minute
corpuscles
floating
in
a
watery
fluid
or
serum
it
was
found
a
few
years
ago
in
the
course
of
certain
experiments
in
mixing
the
blood
of
animals
that
the
serum
of
one
animal
blood
sometimes
destroyed
the
cells
of
the
other
blood
and
at
other
times
did
not
when
the
experiments
were
multiplied
it
was
found
that
the
amount
of
destructive
action
exercised
by
one
specimen
of
blood
upon
another
depended
on
the
nearness
or
remoteness
of
relationship
between
the
animals
if
the
two
are
closely
related
there
is
no
disturbance
when
their
blood
is
mixed
when
they
are
not
closely
related
the
serum
of
one
destroys
the
cells
of
the
other
and
the
intensity
of
the
action
is
in
proportion
to
their
remoteness
from
each
other
another
and
more
elaborate
form
of
the
experiment
was
devised
and
the
law
was
confirmed
on
both
tests
it
was
found
by
experiment
that
the
blood
of
man
and
of
the
anthropoid
ape
behaved
in
such
a
way
as
to
prove
that
they
were
closely
related
the
blood
of
the
monkey
showed
a
less
close
relationship
a
little
more
remote
in
the
new
world
than
in
the
old
world
monkeys
and
the
blood
of
the
femur
showed
a
faint
and
distant
relationship
the
fact
of
the
evolution
of
man
and
the
apes
from
a
common
ancestor
is
therefore
outside
the
range
of
controversy
in
science
we
are
concerned
only
to
retrace
the
stages
of
that
evolution
and
the
agencies
which
controlled
it
here
unfortunately
the
geological
record
gives
us
little
aid
animals
are
amongst
the
least
likely
to
be
buried
in
deposits
which
may
preserve
their
bones
for
ages
the
distribution
of
femur
and
ape
remains
shows
that
the
order
of
the
primates
has
been
widespread
and
numerous
since
the
middle
of
the
tertiary
era
yet
singularly
few
remains
of
the
various
families
have
been
preserved
hence
the
origin
of
the
primates
is
obscure
they
are
first
foreshadowed
in
certain
forms
of
the
eocene
period
which
are
said
in
some
cases
adapis
to
combine
the
characters
of
pachyderms
and
femurs
and
in
others
anaptomorphus
to
unite
the
features
of
insectivores
and
femurs
perhaps
the
more
common
opinion
is
that
they
were
evolved
from
a
branch
of
the
insectivores
but
the
evidence
is
too
slender
to
justify
an
opinion
it
was
an
age
when
the
primitive
placental
mammals
were
just
beginning
to
diverge
from
each
other
and
had
still
many
features
in
common
for
the
present
all
we
can
say
is
that
in
the
earliest
spread
of
the
patriarchal
mammal
race
one
branch
adopted
arboreal
life
and
evolved
in
the
direction
of
the
femurs
and
the
apes
the
generally
arboreal
character
of
the
primates
justifies
this
conclusion
in
the
miocene
period
we
find
a
great
expansion
of
the
monkeys
these
in
turn
enter
the
scene
quite
suddenly
and
the
authorities
are
reduced
to
uncertain
and
contradictory
conjectures
as
to
their
origin
some
think
that
they
develop
not
from
the
femurs
but
along
an
independent
line
from
the
insectivores
or
other
ancestors
of
the
primates
we
will
not
linger
over
these
early
monkeys
nor
engage
upon
the
hopeless
task
of
tracing
their
gradual
ramification
into
the
numerous
families
of
the
present
age
it
is
clear
only
that
they
soon
divided
into
two
main
streams
one
of
which
spread
into
the
monkeys
of
america
and
the
other
into
the
monkeys
of
the
old
world
there
are
important
anatomical
differences
between
the
two
the
monkeys
remained
in
central
and
southern
europe
until
near
the
end
of
the
tertiary
gradually
we
perceive
that
the
advancing
cold
is
driving
them
further
south
and
the
monkeys
of
gibraltar
are
the
diminished
remnant
of
the
great
family
that
had
previously
wandered
as
far
as
britain
and
france
a
third
wave
also
spreading
in
the
miocene
equally
obscure
in
its
connection
with
the
preceding
introduces
the
apes
to
the
geologist
primitive
gibbons
pliopithecus
and
pliobylobates
primitive
chimpanzees
palaeopithecus
and
other
early
anthropoid
apes
oreopithecus
dryopithecus
etc
lived
in
the
trees
of
southern
europe
in
the
second
part
of
the
tertiary
era
they
are
clearly
disconnected
individuals
of
a
large
and
flourishing
family
but
from
the
specimens
we
have
yet
discovered
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
except
that
the
family
is
already
branching
into
the
types
of
anthropoid
apes
which
are
familiar
to
us
of
man
himself
we
have
no
certain
and
indisputable
trace
in
the
tertiary
era
some
remains
found
in
java
of
an
pithecanthropus
which
we
will
study
later
are
now
generally
believed
after
a
special
investigation
on
the
spot
to
belong
to
the
pleistocene
period
yet
no
authority
on
the
subject
doubts
that
the
human
species
was
evolved
in
the
tertiary
era
and
very
many
if
not
most
of
the
authorities
believe
that
we
have
definite
proof
of
his
presence
the
early
story
of
mankind
is
gathered
not
so
much
from
the
few
fragments
of
human
remains
we
have
but
from
the
stone
implements
which
were
shaped
by
his
primitive
intelligence
and
remain
almost
imperishable
in
the
soil
over
which
he
wandered
the
more
primitive
man
was
the
more
ambiguous
would
be
the
traces
of
his
shaping
of
these
stone
implements
and
the
earliest
specimens
are
bound
to
be
a
matter
of
controversy
it
is
claimed
by
many
distinguished
authorities
that
flints
slightly
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
or
at
least
used
as
implements
by
man
are
found
in
abundance
in
england
france
and
germany
and
belong
to
the
pliocene
period
continental
authorities
even
refer
some
of
them
to
the
miocene
and
the
last
part
of
the
oligocene
the
question
whether
an
animal
which
nearly
all
would
agree
to
regard
as
in
some
degree
human
wandered
over
what
is
now
the
south
of
england
kent
essex
dorsetshire
etc
as
many
hundred
thousand
years
ago
as
this
claim
would
imply
is
certainly
one
of
great
interest
but
there
would
be
little
use
in
discussing
here
the
question
of
the
eoliths
as
these
disputed
implements
are
called
a
very
keen
controversy
is
still
being
conducted
in
regard
to
them
and
some
of
the
highest
authorities
in
england
france
and
germany
deny
that
they
show
any
trace
of
human
workmanship
or
usage
although
they
have
the
support
of
such
high
authorities
as
sir
prestwich
sir
ray
lankester
lord
avebury
keane
blackmore
professor
schwartz
they
are
one
of
those
controverted
testimonies
on
which
it
would
be
to
rely
in
such
a
work
as
this
we
must
say
then
that
we
have
no
undisputed
traces
of
man
in
the
tertiary
era
the
tertiary
implements
which
have
been
at
various
times
claimed
in
france
italy
and
portugal
are
equally
disputed
the
remains
which
were
some
years
ago
claimed
as
tertiary
in
the
united
states
are
generally
disallowed
and
the
recent
claims
from
south
america
are
under
discussion
yet
it
is
the
general
feeling
of
anthropologists
that
man
was
evolved
in
the
tertiary
era
on
the
one
hand
the
anthropoid
apes
were
highly
developed
by
the
miocene
period
and
it
would
be
almost
incredible
that
the
future
human
stock
should
linger
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
behind
them
on
the
other
hand
when
we
find
the
first
traces
of
man
in
the
pleistocene
this
development
has
already
proceeded
so
far
that
its
earlier
phase
evidently
goes
back
into
the
tertiary
let
us
pass
beyond
the
tertiary
era
for
a
moment
and
examine
the
earliest
and
most
primitive
remains
we
have
of
human
or
beings
the
first
appearance
of
man
in
the
chronicle
of
terrestrial
life
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
and
interest
even
the
least
scientific
of
readers
stands
so
to
say
on
tiptoe
to
catch
a
first
glimpse
of
the
earliest
known
representative
of
our
race
and
half
a
century
of
discussion
of
evolution
has
engendered
a
very
wide
interest
in
the
early
history
of
man
a
personal
experience
may
not
be
without
interest
in
this
connection
among
the
many
inquiries
directed
to
me
in
regard
to
evolution
i
received
in
one
month
a
letter
from
a
negro
in
british
guiana
and
an
extremely
sensible
query
from
an
inmate
of
an
english
asylum
for
the
insane
the
problem
that
beset
the
latter
of
the
two
was
whether
the
lemuranda
preceded
the
lemurogona
in
eocene
times
he
had
found
a
contradiction
in
the
statements
of
two
scientific
writers
fortunately
although
these
patriarchal
bones
are
very
scanty
two
teeth
a
and
the
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
form
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
their
living
owner
they
have
been
subjected
to
so
searching
a
scrutiny
and
discussion
since
they
were
found
in
java
in
and
that
there
is
now
a
general
agreement
as
to
their
nature
at
first
some
of
the
experts
thought
that
they
were
the
remains
of
an
abnormally
low
man
and
others
that
they
belonged
to
an
abnormally
high
ape
the
majority
held
from
the
start
that
they
belonged
to
a
member
of
a
race
almost
midway
between
the
highest
family
of
apes
and
the
lowest
known
tribe
of
men
and
therefore
fully
merited
the
name
of
pithecanthropus
this
is
now
the
general
view
of
anthropologists
the
of
java
was
in
every
respect
entitled
to
that
name
the
teeth
suggest
a
lower
part
of
the
face
in
which
the
teeth
and
lips
projected
more
than
in
the
most
types
of
central
africa
the
has
very
heavy
ridges
over
the
eyes
and
a
low
receding
forehead
far
less
human
than
in
any
previously
known
prehistoric
skull
the
is
very
much
heavier
than
any
known
human
femur
of
the
same
length
and
so
appreciably
curved
that
the
owner
was
evidently
in
a
condition
of
transition
from
the
crouch
of
the
ape
to
the
erect
attitude
of
man
the
in
other
words
was
a
heavy
squat
powerful
animal
of
small
stature
but
above
the
pygmy
standard
erect
in
posture
but
with
clear
traces
of
the
proneness
of
his
ancestor
far
removed
from
the
highest
ape
in
brainpower
but
almost
equally
far
removed
from
the
lowest
savage
that
is
known
to
us
we
shall
see
later
that
there
is
some
recent
criticism
by
weighty
authorities
of
the
earlier
statements
in
regard
to
the
brain
of
primitive
man
this
does
not
apply
to
the
of
java
the
average
cranial
capacity
the
amount
of
the
skull
may
contain
of
the
chimpanzees
the
highest
apes
is
about
cubic
centimetres
the
average
cranial
capacity
of
the
lowest
races
of
men
of
moderate
stature
is
about
and
the
cranial
capacity
of
was
about
it
is
immaterial
whether
or
no
these
bones
belong
to
the
same
individual
if
they
do
not
we
have
remains
of
two
or
three
individuals
of
the
same
intermediate
species
nor
does
it
matter
whether
or
no
this
early
race
is
a
direct
ancestor
of
the
later
races
of
men
or
an
extinct
offshoot
from
the
advancing
human
stock
it
is
in
either
case
an
illustration
of
the
intermediate
phase
between
the
ape
and
man
the
more
important
tasks
are
to
trace
the
relationship
of
this
early
human
stock
to
the
apes
and
to
discover
the
causes
of
its
superior
evolution
the
first
question
has
a
predominantly
technical
interest
and
the
authorities
are
not
agreed
in
replying
to
it
we
saw
that
on
the
man
showed
a
very
close
relationship
to
the
anthropoid
apes
a
less
close
affinity
to
the
old
world
monkeys
a
more
remote
affinity
to
the
american
monkeys
and
a
very
faint
and
distant
affinity
to
the
femurs
a
comparison
of
their
structures
suggests
the
same
conclusion
it
is
therefore
generally
believed
that
the
anthropoid
apes
and
man
had
a
common
ancestor
in
the
early
miocene
or
oligocene
that
this
group
was
closely
related
to
the
ancestral
group
of
the
old
world
monkeys
and
that
all
originally
sprang
from
a
primitive
and
generalised
in
other
words
a
branch
of
the
earliest
forms
diverges
before
the
specific
are
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
monkey
in
this
still
vague
and
patriarchal
group
a
branch
diverges
before
the
are
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
anthropoids
and
this
group
in
turn
spreads
into
a
number
of
types
some
of
which
are
the
extinct
apes
of
the
miocene
four
become
the
gorilla
chimpanzee
orang
and
gibbon
of
and
one
is
the
group
that
will
become
man
to
put
it
still
more
precisely
if
we
found
a
whole
series
of
remains
of
man
ancestors
during
the
tertiary
we
should
probably
class
them
broadly
as
in
the
eocene
in
the
oligocene
and
in
the
miocene
in
that
sense
only
man
descends
from
a
monkey
the
far
more
important
question
is
how
did
this
one
particular
group
of
anthropoid
animals
of
the
miocene
come
to
surpass
all
its
cousins
and
all
the
rest
of
the
mammals
in
let
us
first
rid
the
question
of
its
supposed
elements
of
mystery
and
make
of
it
a
simple
problem
some
imagine
that
a
sudden
and
mysterious
rise
in
intelligence
lifted
the
progenitor
of
man
above
its
fellows
the
facts
very
quickly
dispel
this
illusion
we
may
at
least
assume
that
the
ancestor
of
man
was
on
a
level
with
the
anthropoid
ape
in
the
miocene
period
and
we
know
from
their
skulls
that
the
apes
were
as
advanced
then
as
they
are
now
but
from
the
early
miocene
to
the
pleistocene
is
a
stretch
of
about
a
million
years
on
the
very
lowest

man
occupied
about
a
million
years
in
travelling
from
the
level
of
the
chimpanzee
to
a
level
below
that
of
the
crudest
savage
ever
discovered
if
we
set
aside
the
java
man
as
a
possible
survivor
of
an
earlier
phase
we
should
still
have
to
say
that
much
more
than
a
million
years
after
his
departure
from
the
chimpanzee
level
man
had
merely
advanced
far
enough
to
chip
stone
implements
because
we
find
no
other
trace
whatever
of
intelligence
than
this
until
near
the
close
of
the
palaeolithic
period
if
there
is
any
mystery
it
is
in
the
slowness
of
man
development
let
us
further
recollect
that
it
is
a
common
occurrence
in
the
calendar
of
life
for
a
particular
organ
to
be
especially
developed
in
one
member
of
a
particular
group
more
than
in
the
others
the
trunk
of
the
elephant
the
neck
of
the
giraffe
the
limbs
of
the
horse
or
deer
the
canines
of
the
tiger
the
wings
of
the
bat
the
colouring
of
the
tiger
the
horns
of
the
deer
are
so
many
examples
in
the
mammal
world
alone
the
brain
is
a
useful
organ
like
any
other
and
it
is
easy
to
conceive
that
the
circumstances
of
one
group
may
select
it
just
as
the
environment
of
another
group
may
lead
to
the
selection
of
speed
weapons
or
colouring
in
fact
as
we
saw
there
was
so
great
and
general
an
evolution
of
brain
in
the
tertiary
era
that
our
modern
mammals
quite
commonly
have
many
times
the
brain
of
their
tertiary
ancestors
can
we
suggest
any
reasons
why
brain
should
be
especially
developed
in
the
apes
and
more
particularly
still
in
the
ancestors
of
man
the
primate
group
generally
is
a
race
of
the
appearance
of
fruit
on
early
tertiary
trees
and
the
multiplication
of
carnivores
explain
this
the
primate
is
except
in
a
few
robust
cases
a
particularly
defenceless
animal
when
its
earliest
ancestors
came
in
contact
with
fruit
and
trees
they
developed
climbing
power
and
other
means
of
defence
and
offense
were
sacrificed
keenness
of
scent
and
range
of
hearing
would
now
be
of
less
moment
but
sight
would
be
stimulated
especially
when
climbing
carnivores
came
on
the
scene
there
is
however
a
much
deeper
significance
in
the
adoption
of
climbing
and
we
must
borrow
a
page
from
the
modern
physiology
of
the
brain
to
understand
it
the
stress
laid
in
the
modern
education
of
young
children
on
the
use
of
the
hands
is
not
merely
due
to
a
feeling
that
they
should
handle
objects
as
well
as
read
about
them
it
is
partly
due
to
the
belief
of
many
distinguished
physiologists
that
the
training
of
the
hands
has
a
direct
stimulating
effect
on
the
in
the
brain
the
centre
in
the
cerebrum
which
controls
the
use
of
the
hands
is
on
the
fringe
of
the
region
which
seems
to
be
concerned
in
mental
operations
for
reasons
which
will
appear
presently
we
may
add
that
the
centres
for
controlling
the
muscles
of
the
face
and
head
are
in
the
same
region
any
finer
training
or
the
use
of
the
hands
will
develop
the
centre
for
the
fore
limbs
and
on
the
principles
may
react
on
the
more
important
region
of
the
cortex
hence
in
turning
the
fore
foot
into
a
hand
for
climbing
and
grasping
purposes
the
primitive
primate
entered
upon
the
path
of
even
the
earliest
primates
show
large
brains
in
comparison
with
the
small
brains
of
their
contemporaries
it
is
a
familiar
fact
in
the
animal
world
that
when
a
certain
group
enters
upon
a
particular
path
of
evolution
some
members
of
the
group
advance
only
a
little
way
along
it
some
go
farther
and
some
outstrip
all
the
others
the
development
of
social
life
among
the
bees
will
illustrate
this
hence
we
need
not
be
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
the
lemurs
have
remained
at
one
mental
level
the
monkeys
at
another
and
the
apes
at
a
third
it
is
the
common
experience
of
life
and
it
is
especially
clear
among
the
various
races
of
men
a
group
becomes
fitted
to
its
environment
and
as
long
as
its
surroundings
do
not
change
it
does
not
advance
a
related
group
in
a
different
environment
receives
a
particular
stimulation
and
advances
if
moreover
a
group
remains
unstimulated
for
ages
it
may
become
so
rigid
in
its
type
that
it
loses
the
capacity
to
advance
it
is
generally
believed
that
the
lowest
races
of
men
and
even
some
of
the
higher
races
like
the
australian
aboriginals
are
in
this
condition
we
may
expect
this
unteachability
in
a
far
more
stubborn
degree
in
the
anthropoid
apes
which
have
been
adapted
to
an
unchanging
environment
for
a
million
years
all
that
we
need
further
suppose
is
and
it
is
one
of
the
commonest
episodes
in
terrestrial
life
that
one
branch
of
the
miocene
anthropoids
which
were
spread
over
a
large
part
of
the
earth
received
some
stimulus
to
change
which
its
cousins
did
not
experience
it
is
sometimes
suggested
that
social
life
was
the
great
advantage
which
led
to
the
superior
development
of
mind
in
man
but
such
evidence
as
there
is
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
primitive
man
was
solitary
not
social
the
anthropoid
apes
are
not
social
but
live
in
families
and
are
very
unprogressive
on
the
other
hand
the
earliest
remains
of
prehistoric
man
give
no
indication
of
social
life
workshops
caves
enter
the
story
in
a
later
phase
some
authorities
on
prehistoric
man
hold
very
strongly
that
during
the
greater
part
of
the
old
stone
age
at
least
of
the
human
period
man
wandered
only
in
the
company
of
his
mate
and
children
the
point
will
be
more
fully
discussed
later
this
account
of
prehistoric
life
is
well
seen
in
prehistorique
the
lowest
races
also
have
no
tribal
life
and
professor
westermarck
is
of
opinion
that
early
man
was
not
social
we
seem
to
have
the
most
plausible
explanation
of
the
divergence
of
man
from
his
anthropoid
cousins
in
the
fact
that
he
left
the
trees
of
his
and
their
ancestors
this
theory
has
the
advantage
of
being
a
fact
for
the
race
of
java
has
already
left
the
trees
and
providing
a
strong
ground
for
a
dozen
reasons
might
be
imagined
for
his
quitting
the
trees
migration
for
instance
to
a
region
in
which
food
was
more
abundant
and
carnivores
less
formidable
on
the
but
we
will
be
content
with
the
fact
that
he
did
such
a
change
would
lead
to
a
more
consistent
adoption
of
the
upright
attitude
which
is
partly
found
in
the
anthropoid
apes
especially
the
gibbons
the
fore
limb
would
be
no
longer
a
support
of
the
body
the
hand
would
be
used
more
for
grasping
and
the
in
the
brain
would
be
proportionately
stimulated
the
adoption
of
the
erect
attitude
would
further
lead
to
a
special
development
of
the
muscles
of
the
head
and
face
the
centre
for
which
is
in
the
same
important
region
in
the
cortex
there
would
also
be
a
direct
stimulation
of
the
brain
as
having
neither
weapons
nor
speed
the
animal
would
rely
all
the
more
on
sight
and
mind
if
we
further
suppose
that
this
primitive
being
extended
the
range
of
his
hunting
from
insects
and
small
or
dead
birds
to
small
the
stimulation
would
be
all
the
greater
in
a
word
the
very
fact
of
a
change
from
the
trees
to
the
ground
suggests
a
line
of
which
may
plausibly
be
conceived
in
the
course
of
a
million
years
to
evolve
an
out
of
a
ape
and
we
are
not
introducing
any
imaginary
factor
in
this
view
of
human
origins
the
problem
of
the
evolution
of
man
is
often
approached
in
a
frame
of
mind
not
far
removed
from
that
of
the
educated
but
inexpert
european
who
stands
before
the
lowly
figure
of
the
chimpanzee
and
wonders
by
what
miracle
the
gulf
between
it
and
himself
was
bridged
that
is
to
lay
a
superfluous
strain
on
the
imagination
the
proper
term
of
comparison
is
the
lowest
type
of
human
being
known
to
us
since
the
higher
types
of
living
men
have
confessedly
evolved
from
the
lower
but
even
the
lowest
type
of
existing
or
recent
savage
is
not
the
lowest
level
of
humanity
whether
or
no
the
tasmanian
or
the
yahgan
is
a
primitive
remnant
of
the
old
stone
age
we
have
a
far
lower
depth
in
the
java
race
what
we
have
first
to
do
is
to
explain
the
advance
to
that
level
in
the
course
of
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
a
period
fully
a
hundred
times
as
long
as
the
whole
history
of
civilisation
time
itself
is
no
factor
in
evolution
but
in
this
case
it
is
a
significant
condition
it
means
that
on
this
view
of
the
evolution
of
man
we
are
merely
assuming
that
an
advance
in
took
place
between
the
miocene
and
the
pleistocene
not
similar
to
but
immeasurably
less
than
the
advance
which
we
know
to
have
been
made
in
the
last
fifty
thousand
years
in
point
of
fact
the
most
mysterious
feature
of
the
evolution
of
man
was
its
slowness
we
shall
see
that
to
meet
the
facts
we
must
suppose
man
to
have
made
little
or
no
progress
during
most
of
this
vast
period
and
then
to
have
received
some
new
stimulation
to
develop
what
it
was
we
have
now
to
inquire
chapter
xix
man
and
the
great
in
discussing
the
development
of
plants
and
animals
during
the
tertiary
era
we
have
already
perceived
the
shadow
of
the
approaching
we
found
that
in
the
course
of
the
tertiary
the
types
which
were
more
sensitive
to
cold
gradually
receded
southward
and
before
its
close
europe
asia
and
north
america
presented
a
distinctly
temperate
aspect
this
is
but
the
penumbra
of
the
eclipse
when
we
pass
the
limits
of
the
tertiary
era
and
enter
the
quaternary
the
refrigeration
steadily
proceeds
and
from
temperate
the
aspect
of
much
of
europe
and
north
america
becomes
arctic
from
six
to
eight
million
square
miles
of
the
northern
hemisphere
are
buried
under
fields
of
snow
and
ice
and
even
in
the
southern
regions
smaller
glacial
sheets
spread
from
the
foot
of
the
higher
ranges
of
mountains
it
is
unnecessary
to
explain
at
any
length
the
evidences
by
which
geologists
trace
this
enormous
glaciation
of
the
northern
hemisphere
there
are
a
few
works
still
in
circulation
in
which
popular
writers
relying
on
the
obstinacy
of
a
few
older
geologists
speak
lightly
of
the
nightmare
of
the
but
the
age
has
gone
by
in
which
it
could
seriously
be
suggested
that
the
boulders
strewn
along
the
east
of
scotland
fragments
of
rock
whose
home
we
must
seek
in
scandinavia
were
brought
by
the
vikings
as
ballast
for
their
ships
even
the
more
serious
controversy
whether
the
scratches
and
the
boulders
which
we
find
on
the
face
of
northern
europe
and
america
were
due
to
floating
or
land
ice
is
virtually
settled
several
decades
of
research
have
detected
the
unmistakable
signs
of
glacial
action
over
this
vast
area
of
the
northern
hemisphere
most
of
europe
north
of
the
thames
and
the

nearly
all
canada

a
very
large

is
now
not
the
least

that
where
the
great

floundered
in

flourished

the
most

even
heavier

as
the
period
advanced
their

the

only

almost
the

in

the

even
more
extensive
about
four
million
square

of
the

their
glaciated

north
asia
was
largely
glaciated
but
the
range
of
the
is
not
yet
determined
in
that
continent
this
summary
statement
will
convey
some
idea
of
the
extraordinary
phase
through
which
the
earth
passed
in
the
early
part
of
the
present
geological
era
but
it
must
be
added
that
a
singular
circumstance
prolonged
the
glacial
regime
in
the
northern
hemisphere
modern
geologists
speak
rather
of
a
series
of
successive
than
of
one
definite
some
indeed
speak
of
a
series
of
but
we
need
not
discuss
the
verbal
question
it
is
now
beyond
question
that
the
advanced
and
retreated
several
times
during
the
glacial
epoch
the
american
and
some
english
geologists
distinguished
six
with
five
intermediate
periods
of
more
temperate
climate
the
german
and
many
english
and
french
geologists
distinguish
four
sheets
and
three
interglacial
epochs
the
exact
number
does
not
concern
us
but
the
repeated
spread
of
the
ice
is
a
point
of
some
importance
the
various
sheets
differed
considerably
in
extent
the
wide
range
of
the
ice
which
i
have
described
represents
the
greatest
extension
of
the
glaciation
and
probably
corresponds
to
the
second
or
third
of
the
six
advances
in
geikie
and
the
american
classification
before
we
consider
the
biological
effect
of
this
great
of
refrigeration
of
the
globe
we
must
endeavour
to
understand
the
occurrence
itself
here
we
enter
a
world
of
controversy
but
a
few
suggestions
at
least
may
be
gathered
from
the
large
literature
of
the
subject
which
dispel
much
of
the
mystery
of
the
great
it
was
at
one
time
customary
to
look
out
beyond
the
earth
itself
for
the
ultimate
causes
of
this
glaciation
imagine
the
sheet
of
ice
which
now
spreads
widely
round
the
north
pole
shifted
to
another
position
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
you
have
a
simple
explanation
of
the
occurrence
in
other
words
if
we
suppose
that
the
axis
of
the
earth
does
not
consistently
point
in
one
direction
that
the
great
ball
does
not
always
present
the
same
average
angle
in
relation
to
the
sun
the
poles
will
not
always
be
where
they
are
at
present
and
the
pleistocene
may
represent
a
time
when
the
north
pole
was
in
the
latitude
of
north
europe
and
north
america
this
opinion
had
to
be
abandoned
we
have
no
trace
whatever
of
such
a
constant
shifting
of
the
polar
regions
as
it
supposes
and
especially
we
have
no
trace
that
the
warm
zone
correspondingly
shifted
in
the
pleistocene
a
much
more
elaborate
theory
was
advanced
by
croll
and
is
still
entertained
by
many
the
path
of
the
earth
round
the
sun
is
not
circular
but
elliptical
and
there
are
times
when
the
gravitational
pull
of
the
other
planets
increases
the
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
it
was
assumed
that
there
are
periods
of
great
length
separated
from
each
other
by
still
longer
periods
when
this
eccentricity
of
the
orbit
is
greatly
exaggerated
the
effect
would
be
to
prolong
the
winter
and
shorten
the
summer
of
each
hemisphere
in
turn
the
total
amount
of
heat
received
would
not
alter
but
there
would
be
a
long
winter
with
less
heat
per
hour
and
a
short
summer
with
more
heat
the
short
summer
would
not
suffice
to
melt
the
enormous
winter
accumulations
of
ice
and
snow
and
an
would
result
to
this
theory
again
it
is
objected
that
we
do
not
find
the
regular
succession
of
in
the
story
of
the
earth
which
the
theory
demands
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
an
alternation
of
the
ice
between
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
more
recent
writers
have
appealed
to
the
sun
itself
and
supposed
that
some
prolonged
veiling
of
its
photosphere
greatly
reduced
the
amount
of
heat
emitted
by
it
more
recently
still
it
has
been
suggested
that
an
accumulation
of
cosmic
or
meteoric
dust
in
our
atmosphere
or
between
us
and
the
sun
had
for
a
prolonged
period
the
effect
of
a
colossal
neither
of
these
suppositions
would
explain
the
localisation
of
the
ice
in
any
case
we
need
not
have
recourse
to
purely
speculative
accidents
in
the
world
beyond
until
it
is
clear
that
there
were
no
changes
in
the
earth
itself
which
afford
some
explanation
this
is
by
no
means
clear
some
writers
appeal
to
changes
in
the
ocean
currents
it
is
certain
that
a
change
in
the
course
of
the
cold
and
warm
currents
of
the
ocean
might
cause
very
extensive
changes
of
climate
but
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
of
ideas
in
suggesting
that
this
might
have
had
an
equal
or
even
greater
influence
in
former
times
our
ocean
currents
differ
so
much
in
temperature
because
the
earth
is
now
divided
into
very
pronounced
zones
of
climate
these
zones
did
not
exist
before
the
pliocene
period
and
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
any
redistribution
of
currents
in
earlier
times
could
have
had
such
remarkable
consequences
the
same
difficulty
applies
to
on
the
other
hand
we
have
already
in
discussing
the
permian
glaciation
discovered
two
agencies
which
are
very
effective
in
lowering
the
temperature
of
the
earth
one
is
the
rise
of
the
land
the
other
is
the
thinning
of
the
atmosphere
these
are
closely
related
agencies
and
we
found
them
acting
in
conjunction
to
bring
about
the
permian
do
we
find
them
at
work
in
the
pleistocene
it
is
not
disputed
that
there
was
a
very
considerable
upheaval
of
the
land
especially
in
europe
and
north
america
at
the
end
of
the
tertiary
era
every
mountain
chain
advanced
and
our
alps
pyrenees
himalaya
attained
for
the
first
time
their
present
or
an
even
greater
elevation
the
most
critical
geologists
admit
that
europe
as
a
whole
rose
feet
above
its
earlier
level
such
an
elevation
would
be
bound
to
involve
a
great
lowering
of
the
temperature
the
geniality
of
the
oligocene
period
was
due
like
that
of
the
earlier
warm
periods
to
the
land
and
very
extensive
these
conditions
were
revolutionised
before
the
end
of
the
tertiary
great
mountains
towered
into
the
and
vast
areas
were
elevated
which
had
formerly
been
sea
or
swamp
this
rise
of
the
land
involved
a
great
decrease
in
the
proportion
of
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
the
sea
surface
was
enormously
lessened
and
the
mountains
would
now
condense
the
moisture
into
snow
or
cloud
to
a
vastly
greater
extent
than
had
ever
been
known
before
there
would
also
be
a
more
active
circulation
of
the
atmosphere
the
moist
warm
winds
rushing
upward
towards
the
colder
elevations
and
parting
with
their
vapour
as
the
proportion
of
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
lessened
the
would
escape
more
freely
into
space
the
general
temperature
would
fall
and
the
evaporation
or
production
of
moisture
would
be
checked
while
the
condensation
would
continue
the
prolonging
of
such
conditions
during
a
geological
period
can
be
understood
to
have
caused
the
accumulation
of
fields
of
snow
and
ice
in
the
higher
regions
it
seems
further
probable
that
these
conditions
would
lead
to
a
very
considerable
formation
of
fog
and
cloud
and
under
this
protecting
canopy
the
glaciers
would
creep
further
down
toward
the
plains
we
have
then
to
consider
the
possibility
of
a
reduction
of
the
quantity
of
in
the
atmosphere
the
inexpert
reader
probably
has
a
very
exaggerated
idea
of
the
fall
in
temperature
that
would
be
required
to
give
europe
an
if
our
average
temperature
fell
about
degrees
below
the
average
temperature
of
our
time
it
would
suffice
and
it
is
further
calculated
that
if
the
quantity
of
in
our
atmosphere
were
reduced
by
half
we
should
have
this
required
fall
in
temperature
so
great
a
reduction
would
not
be
necessary
in
view
of
the
other
refrigerating
agencies
now
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
proportion
of
was
greatly
reduced
in
the
pleistocene
the
forests
of
the
tertiary
era
would
steadily
reduce
it
but
the
extensive
upheaval
of
the
land
at
its
close
would
be
even
more
important
the
newly
exposed
surfaces
would
absorb
great
quantities
of
carbon
the
ocean
also
as
it
became
colder
would
absorb
larger
and
larger
quantities
of
thus
the
pleistocene
atmosphere
gradually
relieved
of
its
vapours
and
would
no
longer
retain
the
heat
at
the
surface
we
may
add
that
the
growth
of
reflective
surfaces
ice
snow
cloud
would
further
lessen
the
amount
of
heat
received
from
the
sun
here
then
we
have
a
series
of
closely
related
causes
and
effects
which
would
go
far
toward
explaining
if
they
do
not
wholly
suffice
to
explain
the
general
fall
of
the
earth
temperature
the
basic
cause
is
the
upheaval
of
the
land
a
fact
which
is
beyond
controversy
the
other
agencies
are
very
plain
and
recognisable
consequences
of
the
upheaval
there
are
however
many
geologists
who
do
not
think
this
explanation
adequate
it
is
pointed
out
in
the
first
place
that
the
glaciation
seems
to
have
come
long
after
the
elevation
the
difficulty
does
not
seem
to
be
insurmountable
the
reduction
of
the
atmospheric
vapour
would
be
a
gradual
process
beginning
with
the
later
part
of
the
elevation
and
culminating
long
afterwards
the
reduction
of
the
would
be
even
more
gradual
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
long
it
would
take
these
processes
to
reach
a
very
effective
stage
but
it
is
equally
impossible
to
show
that
the
interval
between
the
upheaval
and
the
glaciation
is
greater
than
the
theory
demands
it
is
also
said
that
we
can
not
on
these
principles
understand
the
repeated
advance
and
retreat
of
the
this
objection
again
seems
to
fail
it
is
an
established
fact
that
the
land
sank
very
considerably
during
the
and
has
risen
again
since
the
ice
disappeared
we
find
that
the
crust
in
places
sank
so
low
that
an
arctic
ocean
bathed
the
slopes
of
some
of
the
welsh
mountains
and
american
geologists
say
that
their
land
has
risen
in
places
from
to
feet
chamberlin
since
the
burden
of
ice
was
lifted
from
it
here
we
have
the
possibility
of
an
explanation
of
the
advances
and
retreats
of
the
glaciers
the
refrigerating
agencies
would
proceed
until
an
enormous
burden
of
ice
was
laid
on
the
land
of
the
northern
hemisphere
the
land
apparently
sank
under
the
burden
the
ice
and
snow
melted
at
the
lower
level
and
there
was
a
temperate
interglacial
period
but
the
land
relieved
of
its
burden
rose
once
more
the
exposed
surface
absorbed
further
quantities
of
carbon
and
a
fresh
period
of
refrigeration
opened
this
oscillation
might
continue
until
the
two
sets
of
opposing
forces
were
adjusted
and
the
crust
reached
a
condition
of
comparative
stability
finally
and
this
is
the
more
serious
difficulty
it
is
said
that
we
can
not
in
this
way
explain
the
localisation
of
the
glacial
sheets
why
should
europe
and
north
america
in
particular
suffer
so
markedly
from
a
general
thinning
of
the
atmosphere
the
simplest
answer
is
to
suggest
that
they
especially
shared
the
rise
of
the
land
geology
is
not
in
a
position
either
to
prove
or
disprove
this
and
it
remains
only
a
speculative
interpretation
of
the
fact
we
know
at
least
that
there
was
a
great
uprise
of
land
in
europe
and
north
america
in
the
pliocene
and
pleistocene
and
may
leave
the
precise
determination
of
the
point
to
a
later
age
at
the
same
time
other
local
causes
are
not
excluded
there
may
have
been
a
large
extension
of
the
area
of
atmospheric
depression
which
we
have
in
the
region
of
greenland
when
we
turn
to
the
question
of
chronology
we
have
the
same
acute
difference
of
opinion
as
we
have
found
in
regard
to
all
questions
of
geological
time
it
used
to
be
urged
on
astronomical
grounds
that
the
began
about
years
ago
and
ended
about
years
ago
but
the
astronomical
theory
is
as
i
said
generally
abandoned
geologists
on
the
other
hand
find
it
difficult
to
give
even
approximate
figures
reviewing
the
various
methods
of
calculation
professor
chamberlin
concludes
that
the
time
of
the
first
spread
of
the
is
quite
unknown
the
second
and
greatest
extension
of
the
glaciation
may
have
been
between
and
a
million
years
ago
and
the
last
from
to
years
ago
but
he
himself
attaches
very
little
value
to
the
figures
the
chief
was
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
ago
that
is
all
we
can
say
with
any
confidence
in
dismissing
the
question
of
climate
however
we
should
note
that
a
very
serious
problem
remains
unsolved
as
far
as
present
evidence
goes
we
seem
to
be
free
to
hold
that
the
which
have
at
long
intervals
invaded
the
chronicle
of
the
earth
were
due
to
rises
of
the
land
upheaval
is
the
one
constant
and
clearly
recognisable
feature
associated
with
or
preceding
we
saw
this
in
the
case
of
the
cambrian
permian
eocene
and
pleistocene
periods
of
cold
and
may
add
that
there
are
traces
of
a
rise
of
mountains
before
the
glaciation
of
which
we
find
traces
in
the
middle
of
the
archaean
era
there
are
problems
still
to
be
solved
in
connection
with
each
of
these
very
important
ages
but
in
the
rise
of
the
land
and
consequent
thinning
of
the
atmosphere
we
seem
to
have
a
general
clue
to
their
occurrence
apart
from
these
special
periods
of
cold
however
we
have
seen
that
there
has
been
in
recent
geological
times
a
progressive
cooling
of
the
earth
which
we
have
not
explained
winter
seems
now
to
be
a
permanent
feature
of
the
earth
life
and
polar
caps
are
another
recent
and
apparently
permanent
acquisition
i
find
no
plausible
reason
assigned
for
this
the
suggestion
that
the
disk
of
the
sun
is
appreciably
smaller
since
tertiary
days
is
absurd
and
the
idea
that
the
earth
has
only
recently
ceased
to
allow
its
internal
heat
to
leak
through
the
crust
is
hardly
more
plausible
the
cause
remains
to
be
discovered
we
turn
now
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
great
and
the
relation
of
man
to
it
the
permian
revolution
to
which
the
pleistocene
comes
nearest
in
importance
wrought
such
devastation
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
living
things
perished
do
we
find
a
similar
destruction
of
life
and
selection
of
higher
types
after
the
pleistocene
perturbation
in
particular
had
it
any
appreciable
effect
upon
the
human
species
a
full
description
of
the
effect
of
the
great
would
occupy
a
volume
the
modern
landscape
in
europe
and
north
america
was
very
largely
carved
and
modelled
by
the
and
the
floods
that
ensued
upon
its
melting
hills
were
rounded
valleys
carved
lakes
formed
gravels
and
soils
distributed
as
we
find
them
in
its
vegetal
aspect
also
as
we
saw
the
modern
landscape
was
determined
by
the
pleistocene
revolution
a
great
scythe
slowly
passed
over
the
land
when
the
ice
and
snow
had
ended
and
the
trees
and
flowers
crowded
in
the
southern
area
slowly
spread
once
more
over
the
virgin
soil
it
was
only
the
temperate
species
that
could
pass
the
zone
guarded
by
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
on
the
alps
themselves
the
pleistocene
population
still
lingers
their
successful
adaptation
to
the
cold
now
preventing
them
from
descending
to
the
plains
the
animal
world
in
turn
was
winnowed
by
the
pleistocene
episode
the
hippopotamus
crocodile
turtle
flamingo
and
other
animals
were
banished
to
the
warm
zone
the
mammoth
and
the
rhinoceros
met
the
cold
by
developing
woolly
coats
but
the
disappearance
of
the
ice
which
had
tempted
them
to
this
departure
seems
to
have
ended
their
fitness
other
animals
which
became
adapted
to
the
cold
arctic
bears
foxes
seals
have
retreated
north
with
the
ice
as
the
sheet
melted
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
europe
and
north
america
with
their
alternating
glacial
and
interglacial
periods
witnessed
extraordinary
changes
and
minglings
of
their
animal
population
at
one
time
the
reindeer
the
mammoth
and
the
glutton
penetrate
down
to
the
mediterranean
in
the
next
phase
the
elephant
and
hippopotamus
again
advance
nearly
to
central
europe
it
is
impossible
here
to
attempt
to
unravel
these
successive
changes
and
migrations
great
numbers
of
species
were
destroyed
and
at
length
when
the
climatic
condition
of
the
earth
reached
a
state
of
comparative
stability
the
surviving
animals
settled
in
the
geographical
regions
in
which
we
find
them
the
only
question
into
which
we
may
enter
with
any
fullness
is
that
of
the
relation
of
human
development
to
this
grave
perturbation
of
the
condition
of
the
globe
the
problem
is
sometimes
wrongly
conceived
the
chief
point
to
be
determined
is
not
whether
man
did
or
did
not
precede
the
as
it
is
the
general
belief
that
he
was
evolved
in
the
tertiary
it
is
clear
that
he
existed
in
some
part
of
the
earth
before
the
whether
he
had
already
penetrated
as
far
north
as
britain
and
belgium
is
an
interesting
point
but
not
one
of
great
importance
we
may
therefore
refrain
from
discussing
at
any
length
those
disputed
crude
stone
implements
eoliths
which
in
the
opinion
of
many
prove
his
presence
in
northern
regions
before
the
close
of
the
tertiary
we
may
also
now
disregard
the
remains
of
the
java
there
are
authorities
such
as
deniker
who
hold
that
even
the
latest
research
shows
these
remains
to
be
pliocene
but
it
is
disputed
the
java
race
may
be
a
surviving
remnant
of
an
earlier
phase
of
human
evolution
the
most
interesting
subject
for
inquiry
is
the
fortune
of
our
human
and
prehuman
forerunners
during
the
pliocene
and
pleistocene
periods
it
may
seem
that
if
we
set
aside
the
disputable
evidence
of
the
eoliths
and
the
java
remains
we
can
say
nothing
whatever
on
this
subject
in
reality
a
fact
of
very
great
interest
can
be
established
it
can
be
shown
that
the
progress
made
during
this
enormous
lapse
of
time
at
least
a
million
years
was
remarkably
slow
instead
of
supposing
that
some
extraordinary
evolution
took
place
in
that
conveniently
obscure
past
to
which
we
can
find
no
parallel
within
known
times
it
is
precisely
the
reverse
the
advance
that
has
taken
place
within
the
historical
period
is
far
greater
comparatively
to
the
span
of
time
than
that
which
took
place
in
the
past
to
make
this
interesting
fact
clearer
we
must
attempt
to
measure
the
progress
made
in
the
pliocene
and
pleistocene
we
may
assume
that
the
precursor
of
man
had
arrived
at
the
level
by
the
middle
of
the
miocene
period
he
is
not
at
all
likely
to
have
been
behind
the
anthropoid
apes
and
we
saw
that
they
were
well
developed
in
the
now
we
have
a
good
knowledge
of
man
as
he
was
in
the
later
stage
of
the
at
least
a
million
years
later
and
may
thus
institute
a
useful
comparison
and
form
some
idea
of
the
advance
made
in
the
later
stages
of
the
pleistocene
a
race
of
men
lived
in
europe
of
whom
we
have
a
number
of
skulls
and
skeletons
besides
vast
numbers
of
stone
implements
it
is
usually
known
as
the
neanderthal
race
as
the
first
skeleton
was
found
in
at
neanderthal
near
dusseldorf
further
skeletons
were
found
at
spy
in
belgium
and
krapina
in
croatia
a
skull
formerly
found
at
gibraltar
is
now
assigned
to
the
same
race
in
the
last
five
years
a
jaw
of
the
same
or
an
earlier
age
has
been
found
at
mauer
near
heidelberg
and
several
skeletons
have
been
found
in
france
la
vezere
and
from
these
and
a
few
earlier
fragments
we
have
a
confident
knowledge
of
the
features
of
this
early
human
race
the
highest
appreciation
of
the
neanderthal
man
a
somewhat
flattering
appreciation
as
we
shall
see
is
that
he
had
reached
the
level
of
the
australian
black
of
the
massive
frontal
ridges
over
his
eyes
the
very
low
retreating
forehead
the
throwing
of
the
mass
of
the
brain
toward
the
back
of
the
head
the
outthrust
of
the
teeth
and
jaws
and
the
complete
absence
in
some
cases
or
very
slight
development
of
the
chin
combine
to
give
the
head
what
the
leading
authorities
call
a
bestial
or
simian
aspect
the
frame
is
heavy
powerful
and
of
moderate
height
usually
from
two
to
four
inches
over
five
feet
the
are
much
more
curved
than
in
modern
man
we
can
not
enter
here
into
finer
anatomical
details
but
all
the
features
are
consistent
and
indicate
a
stage
in
the
evolution
from
to
savage
man
one
point
only
calls
for
closer
inquiry
until
a
year
or
two
ago
it
was
customary
to
state
that
in
cranial
capacity
also
that
is
to
say
in
the
volume
of
that
the
skull
might
contain
the
neanderthal
race
was
intermediate
between
the
and
modern
man
we
saw
above
that
the
cranial
capacity
of
the
highest
ape
is
about
cubic
centimetres
and
that
of
the
variously
given
as
and
is
about
it
was
then
added
that
the
capacity
of
the
neanderthal
race
was
about
and
that
of
civilised
man
on
the
average
this
seemed
to
be
an
effective
and
convincing
indication
of
evolution
but
recent
writers
have
seriously
criticised
it
sir
edwin
ray
lankester
professor
sollas
and
keith
have
claimed
in
recent
publications
that
the
brain
of
neanderthal
man
was
as
large
as
if
not
larger
than
that
of
modern
man
professor
sollas
even
observes
that
the
brain
increases
in
volume
as
we
go
backward
this
is
apparently
so
serious
a
reversal
of
the
familiar
statement
in
regard
to
the
evolution
of
man
that
we
must
consider
it
carefully
especially
an
address
by
professor
sollas
in
the
quarterly
journal
of
the
geological
society
vol
lxvi
largeness
of
brain
in
an
individual
is
no
indication
of
intelligence
and
smallness
of
brain
no
proof
of
low
mentality
some
of
the
greatest
thinkers
such
as
aristotle
and
leibnitz
had
abnormally
small
heads
further
the
size
of
the
brain
is
of
no
significance
whatever
except
in
strict
relation
to
the
size
and
weight
of
the
body
woman
has
five
or
six
ounces
less
than
man
but
in
proportion
to
her
average
size
and
the
weight
of
the
vital
tissue
of
her
body
excluding
fat
she
has
as
respectable
a
brain
as
man
when
however
these
allowances
have
been
made
it
has
usually
been
considered
that
the
average
brain
of
a
race
is
in
proportion
to
its
average
intelligence
this
is
not
strictly
true
the
rabbit
has
a
larger
proportion
of
brain
to
body
than
the
elephant
or
horse
and
the
canary
a
larger
proportion
than
the
chimpanzee
professor
sollas
says
that
the
average
cranial
capacity
of
the
eskimo
is
cubic
centimetres
or
nearly
that
assigned
to
the
average
parisian
clearly
the
question
is
very
complex
and
some
of
these
recent
authorities
conclude
that
the
cranial
capacity
or
volume
of
the
brain
has
no
relation
to
intelligence
and
therefore
the
size
of
the
neanderthal
skull
neither
confirms
nor
disturbs
the
theory
of
evolution
the
wise
man
will
suspend
his
judgment
until
the
whole
question
has
been
fully
reconsidered
but
i
would
point
out
that
some
of
the
recent
criticisms
are
exaggerated
the
gibraltar
skull
is
estimated
by
professor
sollas
himself
to
have
a
capacity
of
about
and
his
conclusion
that
it
is
an
abnormal
or
feminine
skull
rests
on
no
positive
grounds
the
skull
alone
is
proved
to
have
the
high
capacity
of
and
it
is
as
yet
not
much
more
than
a
supposition
that
the
earlier
skulls
had
been
wrongly
measured
but
further
the
great
french
authority
boule
who
measured
the
capacity
of
the
saints
skull
observes
that
the
anomaly
disappears
on
careful
study
he
assures
us
that
a
modern
skull
of
the
same
dimensions
would
have
a
capacity
of
cubic
centimetres
and
warns
us
that
we
must
take
into
account
the
robustness
of
the
body
of
primitive
man
he
concludes
that
the
real
volume
of
the
neanderthal
brain
in
this
highest
known
specimen
is
slight
in
comparison
with
the
volume
of
the
brain
lodged
in
the
large
heads
of
and
that
the
bestial
or
characters
of
the
race
are
not
neutralised
by
this
gross
measurement
his
article
in
anthropologie
vol
xx
as
professor
sollas
mainly
relies
on
boule
it
is
important
to
see
that
there
is
a
very
great
difference
between
the
two
we
must
therefore
hesitate
to
accept
the
statement
that
primitive
man
had
as
large
a
brain
if
not
a
larger
brain
than
a
modern
race
the
basis
is
slender
and
the
proportion
of
brain
to
has
not
been
taken
into
account
on
the
other
hand
the
remains
of
this
early
race
are
professor
sollas
says
obviously
more
brutal
than
existing
men
in
all
the
other
ascertainable
characters
by
which
they
differ
from
them
nor
are
we
confined
to
precarious
measurements
of
skulls
we
have
the
remains
of
the
culture
of
this
early
race
and
in
them
we
have
a
surer
trace
of
its
mental
development
here
again
we
must
proceed
with
caution
and
set
aside
confused
and
exaggerated
statements
some
refer
us
to
the
artistic
work
of
primitive
man
we
will
consider
his
drawings
and
carvings
presently
but
they
belong
to
a
later
race
not
the
neanderthal
race
some
lay
stress
on
the
fact
apparently
indicated
in
one
or
two
cases
out
of
a
dozen
that
primitive
man
buried
his
dead
professor
sollas
says
that
it
indicates
that
even
neanderthal
man
had
reached
a
comparatively
high
stage
in
the
evolution
of
religious
ideas
but
the
australians
bury
their
dead
and
the
highest
authorities
are
not
agreed
whether
they
have
any
idea
whatever
of
a
supreme
being
or
of
morality
we
must
also
disallow
appeals
to
the
use
of
fire
the
taming
of
animals
pottery
or
clothing
none
of
these
things
are
clearly
found
in
conjunction
with
the
neanderthal
race
the
only
certain
relic
of
neanderthal
culture
is
the
implement
which
the
primitive
savage
fashioned
by
chipping
or
pressure
of
flint
or
other
hard
stone
the
fineness
of
some
of
these
implements
is
no
indication
of
great
intelligence
the
neanderthal
man
inherited
a
stone
culture
which
was
already
of
great
antiquity
at
least
one
if
not
two
or
three
prolonged
phases
of
the
old
stone
age
were
already
over
when
he
appeared
on
the
most
modest
estimate
men
had
by
that
time
been
chipping
flints
for
several
hundred
thousand
years
and
it
is
no
argument
of
general
intelligence
that
some
skill
in
the
one
industry
of
the
age
had
been
developed
the
true
measure
of
neanderthal
man
capacity
is
that
a
million
years
or
so
after
passing
the
level
he
chipped
his
stones
more
finely
and
gave
them
a
better
edge
and
contour
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
as
yet
hefted
them
it
is
flattering
to
him
to
compare
him
with
the
australian
aboriginal
the
native
art
the
shields
and
spears
and
boomerangs
and
the
elaborate
tribal
and
matrimonial
arrangements
of
the
australian
black
are
not
known
to
have
had
any
counterpart
in
his
life
it
would
therefore
seem
that
the
precursors
of
man
made
singularly
little
if
any
progress
during
the
vast
span
of
time
between
the
miocene
and
the
and
that
then
something
occurred
which
quickened
the
face
of
human
evolution
from
the
neanderthal
level
man
will
advance
to
the
height
of
modern
civilisation
in
about
the
time
that
it
took
him
to
advance
from
the
level
of
the
higher
ape
to
that
of
the
lowest
savage
something
has
broken
into
the
long
lethargy
of
his
primitive
career
and
set
him
upon
a
progressive
path
let
us
see
if
a
careful
review
of
the
stages
of
his
culture
confirms
the
natural
supposition
that
this
something
was
the
fall
in
the
temperature
and
how
it
may
have
affected
him
chapter
xx
the
dawn
of
civilisation
the
story
of
man
before
the
discovery
of
metal
and
the
attainment
of
civilisation
is
notoriously
divided
into
a
palaeolithic
old
stone
age
and
a
neolithic
new
stone
age
each
of
these
ages
is
now
subdivided
into
stages
which
we
will
review
in
succession
but
it
is
important
to
conceive
the
whole
story
of
man
in
more
correct
proportion
than
this
familiar
division
suggests
the
historical
or
civilised
period
is
now
computed
at
about
ten
thousand
years
the
neolithic
age
which
preceded
civilisation
is
usually
believed
to
be
about
four
or
five
times
as
long
though
estimates
of
its
duration
vary
from
about
twenty
to
a
hundred
thousand
years
the
palaeolithic
age
in
turn
is
regarded
as
at
least
three
or
four
times
as
long
as
the
neolithic
estimates
of
time
vary
from
a
hundred
to
five
hundred
thousand
years
and
before
this
there
is
the
vast
stretch
of
time
in
which
the
ape
slowly
became
a
primitive
human
this
long
early
period
is
as
we
saw
still
wrapped
in
mist
and
controversy
a
few
bones
tell
of
a
race
living
in
shape
in
the
region
of
the
indian
ocean
a
few
crude
stones
are
held
by
many
to
indicate
that
a
more
advanced
but
very
lowly
race
wandered
over
the
south
of
europe
and
north
of
africa
before
the
set
in
the
or
cradle
of
the
race
is
not
known
the
old
idea
of
seeking
the
patriarchal
home
on
the
plains
to
the
north
of
india
is
abandoned
and
there
is
some
tendency
to
locate
it
in
the
land
which
has
partly
survived
in
the
islands
of
the
indian
ocean
the
finding
of
early
remains
in
java
is
not
enough
to
justify
that
conclusion
but
it
obtains
a
certain
probability
when
we
notice
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
primates
the
femurs
and
the
apes
are
found
in
africa
and
asia
alone
the
monkeys
have
spread
eastward
to
america
and
westward
to
europe
and
africa
the
human
race
has
spread
into
asia
and
america
northwestward
into
europe
westward
into
africa
and
southward
to
australia
and
the
islands
this
distribution
suggests
a
centre
in
the
indian
ocean
where
there
was
much
more
land
in
the
tertiary
era
than
there
is
now
we
await
further
exploration
in
that
region
and
africa
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
the
supposition
that
man
wandered
into
europe
in
the
tertiary
and
has
left
in
the
eoliths
the
memorials
of
his
lowly
condition
the
anthropoid
apes
certainly
reached
france
however
that
may
be
the
would
restrict
all
the
primates
to
the
south
it
will
be
seen
on
a
glance
at
the
map
that
a
line
of
mountains
would
set
a
stern
barrier
to
man
advance
in
the
early
pleistocene
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
himalaya
if
not
to
the
pacific
he
therefore
spread
westward
and
southward
one
branch
wandered
into
australia
and
was
afterwards
pressed
by
more
advanced
invaders
the
present
blacks
of
australia
into
tasmania
which
seems
to
have
been
still
connected
by
land
another
branch
or
branches
spread
into
africa
to
be
driven
southward
or
into
the
central
forests
by
later
and
better
equipped
invaders
they
survive
little
changed
except
by
recent
contact
with
europeans
in
the
bushmen
and
in
large
populations
of
central
africa
which
are
below
the
level
of
tribal
organisation
others
remained
in
the
islands
and
we
seem
to
have
remnants
of
them
in
the
kalangs
veddahs
etc
but
these
islands
have
been
repeatedly
overrun
by
higher
races
and
the
primitive
life
has
been
modified
comparing
the
most
isolated
of
these
relics
of
early
humanity
we
obtain
many
suggestions
about
the
life
of
that
remote
age
the
aboriginal
tasmanians
who
died
out
about
forty
years
ago
were
of
great
evolutionary
interest
it
is
sometimes
said
that
man
is
distinguished
from
all
other
animals
by
the
possession
of
abstract
ideas
but
the
very
imperfect
speech
of
the
tasmanians
expressed
no
abstract
ideas
their
mind
seems
to
have
been
in
an
intermediate
stage
of
development
they
never
made
fire
and
like
the
other
surviving
fragments
of
early
humanity
they
had
no
tribal
organisation
and
no
ideas
of
religion
or
morality
the
first
effect
of
the
on
this
primitive
humanity
would
be
to
lead
to
a
beginning
of
the
development
of
racial
characters
the
pigment
under
the
skin
of
the
negro
is
a
protection
against
the
actinic
rays
of
the
tropical
sun
the
white
man
with
his
fair
hair
and
eyes
is
a
bleached
product
of
the
northern
regions
and
the
yellow
or
brown
skin
seems
to
be
the
outcome
of
living
in
dry
regions
with
great
extremes
of
temperature
as
the
northern
hemisphere
divided
into
climatic
zones
these
physical
characters
were
bound
to
develop
the
men
who
went
southward
developed
especially
when
fully
exposed
to
the
sun
on
open
plains
the
layer
of
black
pigment
which
marks
the
negroid
type
there
is
good
reason
as
we
shall
see
to
think
that
man
did
not
yet
wear
clothing
though
he
had
a
fairly
conspicuous
if
dwindling
coat
of
hair
on
the
other
hand
the
men
who
lingered
further
north
in
asia
and
north
africa
would
lose
what
pigment
they
had
and
develop
the
lighter
characters
of
the
northerner
it
has
been
noticed
that
even
a
year
in
the
arctic
circle
has
a
tendency
to
make
the
eyes
of
explorers
light
blue
we
may
look
for
the
genesis
of
the
vigorous
races
along
the
fringe
of
the
great
it
must
be
remembered
that
when
the
limit
of
the
was
in
central
germany
and
belgium
the
climate
even
of
north
africa
would
be
very
much
more
temperate
than
it
is
as
the
melted
the
men
who
were
adapted
to
living
in
the
temperate
zone
to
the
south
of
it
penetrated
into
europe
and
the
long
story
of
the
old
stone
age
opened
it
must
not
of
course
be
supposed
that
this
stage
of
human
culture
only
began
with
the
invasion
of
europe
men
would
bring
their
rough
art
of
fashioning
implements
with
them
but
the
southern
regions
are
too
little
explored
to
inform
us
of
the
earlier
stage
but
as
man
enters
europe
he
begins
to
drop
his
flints
on
a
soil
that
we
have
constant
occasion
to
probe
although
the
floor
on
which
he
trod
is
now
sometimes
forty
or
fifty
feet
below
the
surface
and
we
obtain
a
surer
glimpse
of
the
fortunes
of
our
race
most
european
geologists
count
four
distinct
extensions
of
the
with
three
interglacial
periods
it
is
now
generally
believed
that
man
came
north
in
the
third
interglacial
period
though
some
high
authorities
think
that
he
came
in
the
second
as
far
as
england
is
concerned
it
has
been
determined
under
the
auspices
of
the
british
association
that
our
oldest
implements
apart
from
the
eoliths
are
later
than
the
great
but
there
is
some
evidence
that
they
precede
the
last
extension
of
the
ice
two
stages
are
distinguished
in
this
first
part
of
the
palaeolithic
age
the
acheulean
and
chellean
but
it
will
suffice
for
our
purpose
to
take
the
two
together
as
the
earlier
and
longer
section
of
the
old
stone
age
it
was
a
time
of
temperate
if
not
genial
climate
the
elephant
an
extinct
type
the
rhinoceros
the
hippopotamus
the
hyaena
and
many
other
forms
of
animal
life
that
have
since
retired
southward
were
neighbours
of
the
first
human
inhabitant
of
europe
unfortunately
we
have
only
one
bone
of
this
primitive
race
the
jaw
found
at
mauer
in
but
its
massive
size
and
chinless
contour
suggest
a
being
midway
between
the
java
man
and
the
neanderthal
race
his
culture
confirms
the
supposition
there
is
at
this
stage
no
clear
trace
of
fire
clothing
arrows
hefted
weapons
spears
or
social
life
as
the
implements
are
generally
found
on
old
or
the
open
soil
not
in
caves
we
seem
to
see
a
squat
and
powerful
race
wandering
homeless
and
unclad
by
the
streams
and
broad
marshy
rivers
of
the
time
the
thames
and
the
seine
had
not
yet
scooped
out
the
valleys
on
the
slopes
of
which
london
and
paris
are
built
this
period
seems
from
the
vast
number
of
stone
implements
referred
to
it
to
have
lasted
a
considerable
time
there
is
a
risk
in
venturing
to
give
figures
but
it
may
be
said
that
few
authorities
would
estimate
it
at
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
years
man
still
advanced
with
very
slow
and
uncertain
steps
his
whole
progress
in
that
vast
period
being
measured
by
the
invention
of
one
or
two
new
forms
of
stone
implements
and
a
little
more
skill
in
chipping
them
at
its
close
a
great
chill
comes
over
europe
the
last
is
it
seems
spreading
southward
and
we
enter
the
mousterian
period
and
encounter
the
neanderthal
race
which
we
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
whole
culture
of
primitive
times
is
crushed
into
a
few
feet
of
earth
the
anthropologist
is
therefore
quite
unable
to
show
us
the
real
succession
of
human
stages
and
has
to
be
content
with
a
division
of
the
whole
long
and
gradual
evolution
into
a
few
phases
these
phases
however
shade
into
each
other
and
are
merely
convenient
measurements
of
a
continuous
story
the
chellean
man
has
slowly
advanced
to
a
high
level
there
is
no
sudden
incoming
of
a
higher
culture
or
higher
type
of
man
the
most
impressive
relics
of
the
mousterian
period
which
represent
its
later
epoch
are
merely
finely
chipped
implements
there
is
no
art
as
yet
no
pottery
and
no
agriculture
and
there
is
no
clear
trace
of
the
use
of
fire
or
clothing
though
we
should
be
disposed
to
put
these
inventions
in
the
chilly
and
damp
mousterian
period
there
is
therefore
no
ground
for
resenting
the
description
the
primeval
savage
which
has
been
applied
to
early
man
the
human
race
is
already
old
yet
as
we
saw
it
is
hardly
up
to
the
level
of
the
australian
black
the
skeleton
found
at
is
regarded
as
the
highest
known
type
of
the
race
yet
the
greatest
authority
on
it
boule
says
emphatically
in
no
actual
race
do
we
find
the
characters
of
inferiority
that
is
to
say
the
features
which
we
find
in
the
head
the
largeness
of
the
head
is
in
proportion
to
the
robust
frame
but
in
its
specifically
human
part
the
front
it
is
very
low
and
bestial
while
the
heavy
ridges
over
the
large
eyes
the
large
flat
stumpy
nose
the
thick
bulge
of
the
lips
and
teeth
and
the
almost
chinless
jaw
show
that
the
traces
of
his
ancestry
cling
close
to
man
after
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
of
development
the
cold
increases
as
we
pass
to
the
last
part
of
the
old
stone
age
the
solutrean
and
magdalenian
periods
and
nothing
is
clearer
than
that
the
pace
of
development
increases
at
the
same
time
short
as
the
period
is
in
comparison
with
the
preceding
it
witnesses
a
far
greater
advance
than
had
been
made
in
all
the
rest
of
the
old
stone
age
beyond
a
doubt
men
now
live
in
caves
in
large
social
groups
make
clothing
from
the
skins
of
animals
have
the
use
of
fire
and
greatly
improve
the
quality
of
their
stone
axes
scrapers
knives
and
there
is
at
last
some
promise
of
the
civilisation
that
is
coming
in
the
soil
of
the
caverns
in
which
man
lived
especially
in
southern
france
and
the
pyrenean
region
we
find
the
debris
of
a
much
larger
and
fuller
life
even
the
fine
bone
needles
with
which
primitive
man
sewed
his
skin
garments
probably
with
sinews
for
thread
survive
in
scores
in
other
places
we
find
the
ashes
of
the
fires
round
which
he
squatted
often
associated
with
the
bones
of
the
wild
horses
deer
on
which
he
lived
but
the
most
remarkable
indication
of
progress
in
the
is
his
artistic
skill
exaggerated
conclusions
are
sometimes
drawn
from
the
statuettes
carvings
and
drawings
which
we
find
among
the
remains
of
magdalenian
life
most
of
them
are
crude
and
have
the
limitations
of
a
rustic
or
a
child
artist
there
is
no
perspective
no
grouping
animals
are
jumbled
together
and
often
left
unfinished
because
the
available
space
was
not
measured
there
are
however
some
drawings
cut
on
bone
or
horn
or
stone
with
a
flint
implement
which
evince
great
skill
in
and
in
a
few
cases
in
composition
some
of
the
caves
also
are
more
or
less
frescoed
the
outlines
of
animals
sometimes
of
and
in
great
numbers
are
cut
in
the
wall
and
often
filled
in
with
pigment
this
skill
does
not
imply
any
greater
general
intelligence
than
the
rest
of
the
culture
exhibits
it
implies
persistent
and
traditional
concentration
upon
the
new
artistic
life
the
men
who
drew
the
reindeer
of
thayngen
and
carved
the
remarkable
statuettes
of
women
in
ivory
or
stone
were
ignorant
of
the
simplest
rudiments
of
pottery
or
agriculture
which
many
savage
tribes
possess
some
writers
compare
them
with
the
eskimo
of
and
even
suggest
that
the
eskimo
are
the
survivors
of
the
race
retreating
northward
with
the
last
and
possibly
egged
onward
by
a
superior
race
from
the
south
it
is
perhaps
not
a
very
extravagant
claim
that
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
of
development
we
are
now
only
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
years
from
the
dawn
of
civilisation
had
lifted
man
to
the
level
of
the
eskimo
yet
one
must
hesitate
to
admit
the
comparison
lord
avebury
reproduces
an
eskimo
drawing
or
in
his
prehistoric
times
to
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
parallel
in
magdalenian
remains
i
do
not
mean
that
the
art
is
superior
but
the
complex
life
represented
on
the
and
the
intelligence
with
which
it
is
represented
are
beyond
anything
that
we
know
of
palaeolithic
man
i
may
add
that
nearly
all
the
drawings
and
statues
of
men
and
women
which
the
palaeolithic
artist
has
left
us
are
marked
by
the
intense
sexual
exaggeration
the
obscenity
in
modern
phraseology
which
we
are
apt
to
find
in
coarse
savages
three
races
are
traced
in
this
period
one
identified
by
skeletons
found
at
mentone
and
by
certain
statuettes
was
negroid
in
character
probably
there
was
an
occasional
immigration
from
africa
another
race
was
very
tall
and
seems
to
represent
an
invasion
from
some
other
part
of
the
earth
toward
the
close
of
the
old
stone
age
the
third
race
which
is
compared
to
the
eskimo
and
had
a
stature
of
about
five
feet
seem
to
be
the
real
continuers
of
the
palaeolithic
man
of
europe
curiously
enough
we
have
less
authentic
remains
of
this
race
than
of
its
predecessor
and
can
only
say
that
as
we
should
expect
the
features
the
low
forehead
the
heavy
frontal
ridges
the
bulging
teeth
are
moderating
the
needles
we
have
found
round
polished
and
pierced
splinters
of
bone
sometimes
nearly
as
fine
as
a
bodkin
show
indisputably
that
man
then
had
clothing
but
it
is
curious
that
the
artist
nearly
always
draws
him
nude
there
is
also
generally
a
series
of
marks
round
the
contour
of
the
body
to
indicate
that
he
had
a
conspicuous
coat
of
hair
unfortunately
the
faces
of
the
men
are
merely
a
few
unsatisfactory
gashes
in
the
bone
or
horn
and
do
not
picture
this
interesting
race
to
us
the
various
statuettes
of
women
generally
suggest
a
type
akin
to
the
wife
of
the
bushman
we
have
in
fine
a
race
of
hunters
with
fine
stone
knives
and
javelins
toward
the
close
of
the
period
we
find
a
single
representation
of
an
arrow
which
was
probably
just
coming
into
use
but
it
is
not
generally
known
in
the
old
stone
age
one
of
the
drawings
seems
to
represent
a
kind
of
bridle
on
a
horse
but
we
need
more
evidence
than
this
to
convince
us
that
the
horse
was
already
tamed
nor
is
there
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
dog
or
reindeer
had
been
tamed
or
that
the
ground
was
tilled
even
in
the
most
rudimentary
way
artistic
skill
the
use
of
clothing
and
fire
and
a
finer
feeling
in
the
shaping
of
weapons
and
implements
are
the
highest
certain
indications
of
the
progress
made
by
the
end
of
the
old
stone
age
but
there
was
probably
an
advance
made
which
we
do
not
find
recorded
or
only
equivocally
recorded
in
the
memorials
of
the
age
speech
was
probably
the
greatest
invention
of
magdalenian
man
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
spine
in
the
lower
jaw
to
which
the
is
attached
is
so
poorly
developed
in
palaeolithic
man
that
we
may
infer
from
it
the
absence
of
articulate
speech
the
deduction
has
been
criticised
but
a
comparison
of
the
palaeolithic
jaw
with
that
of
the
ape
on
one
hand
and
modern
man
on
the
other
gives
weight
to
it
whatever
may
have
been
earlier
man
power
of
expression
the
closer
social
life
of
the
magdalenian
period
would
lead
to
a
great
development
of
it
some
writers
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
certain
obscure
marks
painted
on
pebbles
or
drawn
on
the
by
men
at
the
close
of
the
palaeolithic
age
may
represent
a
beginning
of
written
language
or
numbers
or
conventional
signs
the
interpretation
of
these
is
obscure
and
doubtful
it
is
not
until
ages
afterwards
that
we
find
the
first
clear
traces
of
written
language
and
then
they
take
the
form
of
pictographs
like
the
egyptian
hieroglyphics
or
the
earliest
chinese
characters
we
can
not
doubt
however
that
articulate
speech
would
be
rapidly
evolved
in
the
social
life
of
the
later
magdalenian
period
and
the
importance
of
this
acquisition
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
imagine
even
a
modern
community
without
the
device
of
articulate
language
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
community
who
are
now
maintained
at
a
certain
level
by
the
thought
of
others
communicated
to
them
by
speech
would
sink
below
the
civilised
standard
and
the
transmission
and
improvement
of
ideas
would
be
paralysed
it
would
not
be
paradoxical
to
regard
the
social
life
and
developing
speech
of
magdalenian
man
as
the
chief
cause
of
the
rapid
advance
toward
civilisation
which
will
follow
in
the
next
period
and
it
is
not
without
interest
to
notice
that
a
fall
in
the
temperature
of
the
earth
is
the
immediate
cause
of
this
social
life
the
building
of
homes
of
any
kind
seems
to
be
unknown
to
magdalenian
man
the
artist
would
have
left
us
some
sketchy
representation
of
it
if
there
had
been
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
tent
in
his
surroundings
the
and
the
cave
are
the
homes
which
men
seek
from
the
advancing
cold
as
these
are
relatively
few
in
number
fixed
in
locality
and
often
of
large
dimensions
the
individualism
of
the
earlier
times
is
replaced
by
collective
life
sociologists
still
dispute
whether
the
clan
arose
by
the
cohesion
of
families
or
the
family
arose
within
the
clan
such
evidence
as
is
afforded
by
prehistoric
remains
is
entirely
in
favour
of
the
opinion
of
professor
westermarck
that
the
family
preceded
the
larger
group
families
of
common
descent
would
now
cling
together
and
occupy
a
common
cavern
and
when
the
men
gathered
at
night
with
the
women
for
the
roasting
and
eating
of
the
horse
or
deer
they
had
hunted
and
the
work
of
the
artist
and
the
woman
was
considered
the
uncouth
muttering
and
gesticulating
was
slowly
forged
into
the
great
instrument
of
articulate
speech
the
first
condition
of
more
rapid
progress
was
instinctively
gained
our
story
of
life
has
so
often
turned
on
this
periodical
lowering
of
the
climate
of
the
earth
that
it
is
interesting
to
find
this
last
and
most
important
advance
so
closely
associated
with
it
that
we
are
forced
once
more
to
regard
it
as
the
effective
cause
the
same
may
be
said
of
another
fundamental
advance
of
the
men
of
the
later
palaeolithic
age
the
discovery
of
the
art
of
making
fire
it
coincides
with
the
oncoming
of
the
cold
either
in
the
mousterian
or
the
magdalenian
it
was
more
probably
a
chance
discovery
than
an
invention
savages
so
commonly
make
fire
by
friction
rubbing
sticks
drills
that
one
is
naturally
tempted
to
regard
this
as
the
primitive
method
i
doubt
if
this
was
the
case
when
in
neolithic
times
men
commonly
bury
the
dead
and
put
some
of
their
personal
property
in
the
grave
with
them
the
apparatus
we
find
is
a
flint
and
a
piece
of
iron
pyrites
palaeolithic
man
made
his
implements
of
any
kind
of
hard
and
heavy
stone
and
it
is
probable
that
he
occasionally
selected
iron
ore
for
the
purpose
an
attempt
to
chip
it
with
flint
would
cause
sparks
that
might
fall
on
inflammable
material
and
set
it
alight
little
intelligence
would
be
needed
to
turn
this
discovery
to
account
apart
from
these
conjectures
as
to
particular
features
in
the
life
of
prehistoric
man
it
will
be
seen
that
we
have
now
a
broad
and
firm
conception
of
its
evolution
from
the
man
very
slowly
mounts
to
the
stage
of
human
savagery
during
long
ages
he
seems
to
have
made
almost
no
progress
there
is
nothing
intrinsically
progressive
in
his
nature
let
a
group
of
men
be
isolated
at
any
stage
of
human
evolution
and
placed
in
an
unchanging
environment
and
they
will
remain
stationary
for
an
indefinite
period
when
europeans
began
to
traverse
the
globe
in
the
last
few
centuries
they
picked
up
here
and
there
little
groups
of
men
who
had
in
their
isolation
remained
just
where
their
fathers
had
been
when
they
quitted
the
main
road
of
advance
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
old
stone
age
the
evolution
of
man
is
guided
by
the
same
laws
as
the
evolution
of
any
other
species
thus
we
can
understand
the
long
period
of
stagnation
or
of
incalculably
slow
advance
thus
too
we
can
understand
why
at
length
the
pace
of
man
toward
his
unconscious
goal
is
quickened
he
is
an
inhabitant
of
the
northern
hemisphere
and
the
northern
hemisphere
is
shaken
by
the
last
of
the
great
geological
revolutions
from
its
first
stress
emerges
the
primeval
savage
of
the
early
part
of
the
old
stone
age
still
bearing
the
deep
imprint
of
his
origin
surpassing
his
only
in
the
use
of
crude
stone
implements
then
the
stress
of
conditions
relaxes
the
great
disappears
and
again
during
a
vast
period
he
makes
very
little
progress
the
stress
returns
the
genial
country
is
stripped
and
impoverished
and
the
reindeer
and
mammoth
spread
to
the
south
of
europe
but
once
more
the
adversity
has
its
use
and
man
stimulated
in
his
hunt
for
food
invigorated
by
the
cold
driven
into
social
life
advances
to
the
culmination
of
the
old
stone
age
we
are
still
very
far
from
civilisation
but
the
few
tens
of
thousands
of
years
that
separate
magdalenian
man
from
it
will
be
traversed
with
relative
speed
though
we
should
always
remember
with
a
speed
far
less
than
the
pace
at
which
man
is
advancing
a
new
principle
now
enters
into
play
a
specifically
human
law
of
evolution
is
formulated
it
has
no
element
of
mysticism
and
is
merely
an
expression
of
the
fact
that
the
previous
general
agencies
of
development
have
created
in
man
an
intelligence
of
a
higher
grade
than
that
of
any
other
animal
in
his
larger
and
more
plastic
brain
the
impressions
received
from
the
outer
world
are
blended
in
ideas
and
in
his
articulate
speech
he
has
a
unique
means
of
entering
the
of
his
fellows
the
new
principle
of
evolution
which
arises
from
this
superiority
is
that
man
chief
stimulus
to
advance
will
now
come
from
his
cultural
rather
than
his
physical
environment
physical
surroundings
will
continue
to
affect
him
one
race
will
outstrip
another
because
of
its
advantage
in
soil
climate
or
geographical
position
but
the
chief
key
to
the
remaining
and
more
important
progress
of
mankind
which
we
are
about
to
review
is
the
stimulating
contact
of
the
differing
cultures
of
different
races
this
will
be
seen
best
in
the
history
of
civilisation
but
the
principle
may
be
recognised
in
the
new
stone
age
which
leads
from
primeval
savagery
to
civilisation
or
to
be
more
accurate
and
just
to
the
beginning
of
the
historical
period
it
used
to
be
thought
that
there
was
a
mysterious
blank
or
gulf
between
the
old
and
the
new
stone
age
the
palaeolithic
culture
seemed
to
come
to
an
abrupt
close
and
the
neolithic
culture
was
sharply
distinguished
from
it
it
was
suspected
that
some
great
catastrophe
had
destroyed
the
palaeolithic
race
in
europe
and
a
new
race
entered
as
the
adverse
conditions
were
removed
this
was
especially
held
to
be
the
case
in
england
the
old
palaeolithic
race
had
never
reached
ireland
which
seems
to
have
been
cut
oft
from
the
continent
during
the
and
most
of
the
authorities
still
believe
in
spite
of
some
recent
claims
that
it
never
reached
scotland
england
itself
was
well
populated
and
the
remains
found
in
the
caves
of
derbyshire
show
that
even
the
artist
or
his
art
had
reached
that
district
this
palaeolithic
race
seemed
to
come
to
a
mysterious
end
and
europe
was
then
invaded
by
the
higher
neolithic
race
england
was
probably
detached
from
the
continent
about
the
end
of
the
magdalenian
period
it
was
thought
that
some
great
devastation
the
last
a
submersion
of
the
land
or
a
plague
then
set
in
and
men
were
unable
to
retreat
south
it
is
now
claimed
by
many
authorities
that
there
are
traces
of
a
middle
stone
mesolithic
period
even
in
england
and
nearly
all
the
authorities
admit
that
such
a
transitional
stage
can
be
identified
in
the
pyrenean
region
this
region
had
been
the
great
centre
of
the
magdalenian
culture
its
large
frescoed
caverns
exhibit
the
culmination
of
the
old
stone
life
and
afford
many
connecting
links
with
the
new
it
is
however
a
clearly
established
and
outstanding
fact
that
the
characteristic
art
of
magdalenian
man
comes
to
an
abrupt
and
complete
close
and
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
explain
this
without
supposing
that
the
old
race
was
destroyed
or
displaced
if
we
could
accept
the
view
that
it
was
the
race
of
the
palaeolithic
that
cultivated
this
art
and
that
they
retreated
north
with
the
reindeer
and
the
ice
and
survive
in
our
eskimo
we
should
have
a
plausible
explanation
in
point
of
fact
we
find
no
trace
whatever
of
this
slow
migration
from
the
south
of
europe
to
the
north
the
more
probable
supposition
is
that
a
new
race
with
more
finished
stone
implements
entered
europe
imposed
its
culture
upon
the
older
race
and
gradually
exterminated
or
replaced
it
we
may
leave
it
open
whether
a
part
of
the
old
race
retreated
to
the
north
and
became
the
eskimo
whence
came
the
new
race
and
its
culture
it
will
be
seen
on
reflection
that
we
have
so
far
been
studying
the
evolution
of
man
in
europe
only
because
there
alone
are
his
remains
known
with
any
fullness
but
the
important
region
which
stretches
from
morocco
to
persia
must
have
been
an
equally
if
not
more
important
theatre
of
development
while
europe
was
shivering
in
the
last
stage
of
the
and
the
mammoth
and
reindeer
browsed
in
the
snows
down
to
the
south
of
france
this
region
would
enjoy
an
excellent
climate
and
a
productive
soil
we
may
confidently
assume
that
there
was
a
large
and
stirring
population
of
human
beings
on
it
during
the
magdalenian
cold
we
may
with
many
of
the
authorities
look
to
this
temperate
and
fertile
region
for
the
slight
advance
made
by
early
neolithic
man
beyond
his
predecessor
as
the
cold
relaxed
and
the
southern
fringe
of
dreary
steppe
w
as
converted
once
more
into
genial
country
the
race
would
push
north
there
is
evidence
that
there
were
still
land
bridges
across
the
mediterranean
from
spain
and
the
south
of
france
this
early
neolithic
race
rapidly
spread
over
europe
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
new
stone
age
at
first
goes
much
beyond
the
old
in
culture
works
on
prehistoric
man
are
apt
to
give
as
features
of
neolithic
man
all
that
we
know
him
to
have
done
or
discovered
during
the
whole
of
the
new
stone
age
we
read
that
he
not
only
gave
a
finer
finish
to
and
sometimes
polished
his
stone
weapons
but
built
houses
put
imposing
monuments
over
his
dead
and
had
agriculture
tame
cattle
pottery
and
weaving
this
is
misleading
as
the
more
advanced
of
these
accomplishments
appear
only
late
in
the
new
stone
age
the
only
difference
we
find
at
first
is
that
the
stone
axes
are
more
finely
chipped
or
flaked
and
are
frequently
polished
by
rubbing
on
stone
moulds
there
is
no
sudden
leap
in
culture
or
intelligence
in
the
story
of
man
it
would
be
supremely
interesting
to
trace
the
evolution
of
human
industries
and
ideas
during
the
few
tens
of
thousands
of
years
of
the
new
stone
age
during
that
time
moral
and
religious
ideas
are
largely
developed
political
or
social
forms
are
elaborated
and
the
arts
of
civilised
man
have
their
first
rude
inauguration
the
foundations
of
civilisation
are
laid
unfortunately
precisely
because
the
period
is
relatively
so
short
and
the
advance
so
rapid
its
remains
are
crushed
and
mingled
in
a
thin
seam
of
the
geological
chronicle
and
we
can
not
restore
the
gradual
course
of
its
development
with
any
confidence
estimates
of
its
duration
vary
from
to
years
though
sir
turner
has
recently
concluded
from
an
examination
of
marks
on
scottish
monuments
that
neolithic
man
probably
came
on
foot
from
scandinavia
to
scotland
and
most
geologists
would
admit
that
it
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
years
since
one
could
cross
from
norway
to
scotland
on
foot
as
usual
we
must
leave
open
the
question
of
chronology
and
be
content
with
a
modest
provisional
estimate
of
or
years
we
dimly
perceive
the
gradual
advance
of
human
culture
in
this
important
period
during
the
old
stone
age
man
had
made
more
progress
than
he
had
made
in
the
preceding
million
years
during
the
new
stone
age
at
least
as
long
as
the
old
he
made
even
greater
progress
and
we
may
add
in
the
historical
period
which
is
the
length
of
the
neolithic
age
he
will
make
greater
progress
still
the
pace
of
advance
naturally
increases
as
intelligence
grows
but
that
is
not
the
whole
explanation
the
spread
of
the
race
the
gathering
of
its
members
into
tribes
and
the
increasing
enterprise
of
men
in
hunting
and
migration
lead
to
incessant
contacts
of
different
cultures
and
a
progressive
stimulation
at
first
neolithic
man
is
content
with
finer
weapons
his
stone
axe
is
so
finely
shaped
and
polished
that
it
sometimes
looks
like
forged
or
moulded
metal
he
also
drills
a
clean
hole
through
it
possibly
by
means
of
a
stick
working
in
wet
sand
and
gives
it
a
long
wooden
handle
he
digs
in
the
earth
for
finer
flints
and
in
some
of
his
ancient
shafts
grimes
graves
and
cissbury
we
find
picks
of
reindeer
horn
and
hollowed
blocks
of
chalk
in
which
he
probably
burned
fat
for
illumination
underground
but
in
the
later
part
of
the
neolithic
to
which
much
of
this
finer
work
also
may
belong
we
find
him
building
huts
rearing
large
stone
monuments
having
tame
dogs
and
pigs
and
oxen
growing
corn
and
barley
and
weaving
primitive
fabrics
he
lives
in
large
and
strong
villages
round
which
we
must
imagine
his
primitive
cornfields
growing
and
his
cattle
grazing
and
in
which
there
must
have
been
some
political
organisation
under
chiefs
when
we
wish
to
trace
the
beginning
of
these
inventions
we
have
the
same
difficulty
that
we
experienced
in
tracing
the
first
stages
of
new
animal
types
the
beginning
takes
place
in
some
restricted
region
and
our
casual
scratching
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
or
the
soil
may
not
touch
it
for
ages
if
it
has
survived
at
all
but
for
our
literature
and
illustrations
a
future
generation
would
be
equally
puzzled
to
know
how
we
got
the
idea
of
the
aeroplane
or
the
electric
light
in
some
cases
we
can
make
a
good
guess
at
the
origin
of
neolithic
man
institutions
let
us
take
pottery
palaeolithic
man
cooked
his
joint
of
horse
or
reindeer
and
no
doubt
scorched
it
suppose
that
some
palaeolithic
soyer
had
conceived
the
idea
of
protecting
the
joint
and
preserving
its
juices
by
daubing
it
with
a
coat
of
clay
he
would
accidentally
make
a
clay
vessel
this
is
clodd
ingenious
theory
of
the
origin
of
pottery
the
development
of
agriculture
is
not
very
puzzling
the
seed
of
corn
would
easily
be
discovered
to
have
a
and
the
discovery
of
the
growth
of
the
plant
from
the
seed
would
not
require
a
very
high
intelligence
some
ants
we
may
recall
have
their
it
would
be
added
by
many
that
the
ant
gives
us
another
parallel
in
its
keeping
of
droves
of
aphides
which
it
milks
but
it
is
now
doubted
if
the
ant
deliberately
cultivates
the
aphides
with
this
aim
early
weaving
might
arise
from
the
plaiting
of
grasses
if
wild
flax
were
used
it
might
be
noticed
that
part
of
it
remained
strong
when
the
rest
decayed
and
so
the
threads
might
be
selected
and
woven
the
building
of
houses
after
living
for
ages
in
stone
caverns
would
not
be
a
very
profound
invention
the
early
houses
were
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
many
remains
in
devonshire
and
cornwall
mere
rings
of
heaped
stones
over
which
most
probably
was
put
a
roof
of
branches
or
reeds
plastered
with
mud
they
belong
to
the
last
part
of
the
new
stone
age
in
other
places
chiefly
switzerland
neolithic
man
lived
in
wooden
huts
built
on
piles
in
the
shallow
shores
of
lakes
it
is
an
evidence
that
life
on
land
is
becoming
as
stimulating
as
we
find
it
in
the
age
of
deinosaurs
or
early
mammals
these
of
switzerland
lasted
until
the
historical
period
and
the
numerous
remains
in
the
mud
of
the
lake
show
the
gradual
passage
into
the
age
of
metal
before
the
metal
age
opened
however
there
seem
to
have
been
fresh
invasions
of
europe
and
changes
of
its
culture
the
movements
of
the
various
early
races
of
men
are
very
obscure
and
it
would
be
useless
to
give
here
even
an
outline
of
the
controversy
anthropologists
have
generally
taken
the
relative
length
and
width
of
the
skull
as
a
standard
feature
of
a
race
and
distinguished
dolichocephalic
brachycephalic
and
mesaticephalic
races
even
on
this
test
the
most
divergent
conclusions
were
reached
in
regard
to
early
races
and
now
the
test
itself
is
seriously
disputed
some
authorities
believe
that
there
is
no
unchanging
type
of
skull
in
a
particular
race
but
that
for
instance
a
race
may
become
by
going
to
live
in
an
elevated
region
it
may
be
said
in
a
few
words
that
it
is
generally
believed
that
two
races
invaded
europe
and
displaced
the
first
neolithic
race
the
race
which
chiefly
settled
in
the
swiss
region
is
generally
believed
to
have
come
from
asia
and
advanced
across
europe
by
way
of
the
valley
of
the
danube
the
native
home
of
the
wheat
and
barley
and
millet
which
as
we
know
the
cultivated
is
said
to
be
asia
on
the
other
hand
the
neolithic
men
who
have
left
stone
monuments
on
our
soil
are
said
to
be
a
different
race
coming
by
way
of
north
africa
from
asia
and
advancing
along
the
west
of
europe
to
scandinavia
a
map
of
the
earth
on
which
the
distribution
of
these
stone
monuments
all
probably
connected
with
the
burial
of
the
dead
is
indicated
suggests
such
a
line
of
advance
from
india
with
a
slighter
branch
eastward
but
the
whole
question
of
these
invasions
is
disputed
and
there
are
many
who
regard
the
various
branches
of
the
population
of
europe
as
sections
of
one
race
which
spread
upward
from
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
it
is
clear
at
least
that
there
were
great
movements
of
population
much
mingling
of
types
and
commercial
interchange
of
products
so
that
we
have
the
constant
conditions
of
advance
a
last
invasion
seems
to
have
taken
place
some
two
or
three
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
when
the
aryans
overspread
europe
after
all
the
controversy
about
the
aryans
it
seems
clear
that
a
powerful
race
representing
the
ancestors
of
most
of
the
actual
peoples
of
europe
and
speaking
the
dialects
which
have
been
modified
into
the
related
languages
of
the
greeks
romans
germans
celts
lithuanians
imposed
its
speech
on
nearly
the
whole
of
the
continent
only
in
the
basques
and
picts
do
we
seem
to
find
some
remnants
of
the
earlier
tongues
but
whether
these
aryans
really
came
from
asia
as
it
used
to
be
thought
or
developed
in
the
east
of
europe
is
uncertain
we
seem
justified
in
thinking
that
a
very
robust
race
had
been
growing
in
numbers
and
power
during
the
neolithic
age
somewhere
in
the
region
of
europe
and
southwest
asia
and
that
a
few
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
one
branch
of
it
descended
upon
india
another
upon
the
persian
region
and
another
overspread
europe
we
will
return
to
the
point
later
instead
of
being
the
bearers
of
a
higher
civilisation
these
primitive
aryans
seem
to
have
been
lower
in
culture
than
the
peoples
on
whom
they
fell
the
neolithic
age
had
meantime
passed
into
the
age
of
metal
copper
was
probably
the
first
metal
to
be
used
it
is
easily
worked
and
is
found
in
nature
but
the
few
copper
implements
we
possess
do
not
suggest
a
copper
age
of
any
length
or
extent
it
was
soon
found
apparently
that
an
admixture
of
tin
hardened
the
copper
and
the
bronze
age
followed
the
use
of
bronze
was
known
in
egypt
about
flinders
petrie
but
little
used
until
about
by
that
time
or
a
few
centuries
later
it
had
spread
as
far
as
scandinavia
and
britain
the
region
of
invention
is
not
known
but
we
have
large
numbers
of
beautiful
specimens
of
bronze
work
including
brooches
and
in
all
parts
of
europe
finally
about
the
thirteenth
century
we
find
the
first
traces
of
the
use
of
iron
the
first
great
centre
for
the
making
of
iron
weapons
seems
to
have
been
hallstatt
in
the
austrian
alps
whence
it
spread
slowly
over
europe
reaching
scandinavia
and
britain
between
and
but
the
story
of
man
had
long
before
this
entered
the
historical
period

which
we
now
turn

in

in
the

have
endeavoured
to

how
without
invoking
any
definitely
directed
variations
which
we
seem
to
have
little
chance
of
understanding
we
may
obtain
a
broad
conception
of
the
way
in
which
the
earth
and
its

inhabitants
came
to

are
no

is
more
conscious
than
the

that
this

extremely
imperfect
the

of

have
permitted

to
use
only
a
part
of
the
material
which
modern
science
affords
but
if
the
whole
of
our
discoveries
were
described
the
sketch
would
still
remain
very
imperfect
the
evolutionary
conception
of
the
world
is
itself
undergoing
evolution
in
the
mind
of
man

by

the

great
mosaic
large
areas
are
still
left
for
the
scientific
artist
of
the
future
to
fill
yet
even
in
its
imperfect
state
the
evolutionary
picture
of
the
world
is
most
illuminating
the
questions
that
have
been
on
the
lips
of
thoughtful
men
since
they
first
looked
out
with
adult
eyes
on
the
panorama
of
nature
are
partly
answered
whence
and
why
are
no
longer
sheer
riddles
of
the
sphinx
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
evolutionary
principles
will
throw
at
least
an
equal
light
on
the
progress
of
humanity
in
the
historical
period
here
again
the
questions
whence
and
why
have
been
asked
in
vain
for
countless
ages
if
man
is
a
progressive
animal
why
has
the
progress
been
confined
to
some
of
the
race
if
humanity
shared
at
first
a
common
patrimony
why
have
the
savages
remained
savages
and
the
barbarians
barbaric
why
has
progress
been
incarnated
so
exceptionally
in
the
white
section
of
the
race
the
europeans
we
approach
these
questions
more
confidently
after
surveying
the
story
of
terrestrial
life
in
the
light
of
evolutionary
principles
since
the
days
of
the
primeval
microbe
it
has
happened
that
a
few
were
chosen
and
many
were
left
behind
there
was
no
progressive
element
in
the
advancing
few
that
was
not
shared
by
the
stagnant
many
the
difference
lay
in
the
environment
let
us
see
if
this
principle
applies
to
the
history
of
civilisation
in
the
last
chapter
i
observed
that
with
the
rise
of
human
intelligence
the
cultural
environment
becomes
more
important
than
the
physical
since
human
progress
is
a
progress
in
ideas
and
the
emotions
which
accompany
them
this
may
seem
to
be
a
truism
in
point
of
fact
it
is
assailed
by
more
than
one
recent
historical
writer
the
scepticism
is
partly
due
to
a
misunderstanding
no
one
but
a
fanatical
adherent
of
extreme
theories
of
heredity
will
deny
that
the
physical
surroundings
of
a
race
continue
to
be
of
great
importance
the
progress
of
a
particular
people
may
often
be
traced
in
part
to
its
physical
environment
especially
to
changes
of
environment
by
migration
for
instance
further
it
is
not
for
a
moment
suggested
that
a
race
never
evolves
its
own
culture
but
has
always
to
receive
it
from
another
if
we
said
that
we
should
be
ultimately
driven
to
recognise
culture
like
the
early
chinese
as
a
gift
of
the
gods
what
is
meant
is
that
the
chief
key
to
the
progress
of
certain
peoples
the
arrest
of
progress
in
others
and
the
entire
absence
of
progress
in
others
is
the
study
of
their
relations
with
or
isolation
from
other
peoples
they
make
progress
chiefly
according
to
the
amount
of
stimulation
they
get
by
contact
with
a
diverse
culture
let
us
see
if
this
furnishes
a
broad
explanation
of
the
position
of
the
various
peoples
of
the
world
the
ethnologist
tells
us
that
the
lowest
peoples
of
the
earth
are
the
yahgans
of
tierra
del
fuego
the
hottentots
a
number
of
peoples
in
central
africa
the
wild
veddahs
of
ceylon
the
extinct
tasmanians
the
aetas
in
the
interior
of
the
philippines
and
certain
fragments
of
peoples
on
islands
of
the
indian
ocean
there
is
not
the
least
trace
of
a
common
element
in
the
environment
of
these
peoples
to
explain
why
they
have
remained
at
the
level
of
primitive
humanity
many
of
them
lived
in
the
most
promising
and
resourceful
surroundings
what
is
common
to
them
all
is
their
isolation
from
the
paths
of
later
humanity
they
represent
the
first
wave
of
human
distribution
pressed
to
the
tips
of
continents
or
on
islands
by
later
waves
and
isolated
the
position
of
the
veddahs
is
to
some
extent
an
exception
and
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
the
latest
german
students
of
that
curious
people
think
that
they
have
been
classed
too
low
by
earlier
investigators
we
can
not
run
over
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
in
this
way
but
will
briefly
glance
at
the
lower
races
of
the
various
continents
a
branch
of
the
second
phase
of
developing
humanity
the
negroid
stock
spread
eastward
over
the
asiatic
islands
and
australia
and
westward
into
africa
the
extreme
wing
of
this
army
the
australian
blacks
too
clearly
illustrates
the
principle
to
need
further
reference
it
has
retained
for
ages
the
culture
of
the
middle
palaeolithic
the
negritos
who
penetrated
to
the
philippines
are
another
extreme
instance
of
isolation
the
melanesians
of
the
islands
of
the
indian
and
pacific
ocean
are
less
low
because
those
islands
have
been
slowly
crossed
by
a
much
higher
race
the
polynesians
the
maoris
of
new
zealand
the
tongans
hawaians
are
people
of
our
own
caucasic
stock
probably
diverging
to
the
while
our
branch
of
the
stock
pressed
westward
this
not
only
explains
the
higher
condition
of
the
maoris
but
also
shows
why
they
have
not
advanced
like
their
european
cousins
their
environment
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
but
it
lies
far
away
from
the
highways
of
culture
in
much
the
same
way
can
we
interpret
the
swarming
peoples
of
africa
the
more
primitive
peoples
which
arrived
first
and
were
driven
south
or
into
the
central
forests
by
the
later
and
better
equipped
invaders
from
the
central
zone
have
remained
the
more
primitive
the
more
northern
peoples
on
the
fringe
of
or
liable
to
invasion
from
the
central
zone
have
made
more
advance
and
have
occasionally
set
up
rudimentary
civilisations
but
the
movements
from
the
north
to
the
south
in
early
historical
times
are
too
obscure
to
enable
us
to
trace
the
action
of
the
principle
more
clearly
the
peoples
of
the
mediterranean
fringe
of
africa
living
in
the
central
zone
of
stimulation
have
proved
very
progressive
under
the
romans
north
africa
was
at
least
as
civilised
as
britain
and
an
equally
wise
and
humane
european
policy
might
lead
to
their
revival
when
we
turn
to
asia
we
encounter
a
mass
of
peoples
and
a
few
civilisations
with
obscure
histories
but
we
have
a
fairly
clear
application
of
the
principle
the
northern
more
isolated
peoples
are
the
more
primitive
the
whose
isolation
is
accentuated
by
a
severe
environment
are
most
primitive
of
all
the
eskimo
whether
they
are
the
survivors
of
the
magdalenian
race
or
a
regiment
thrown
off
the
asiatic
army
as
it
entered
america
remain
at
the
primitive
level
the
american
peoples
in
turn
accord
with
this
view
those
which
penetrate
furthest
south
remain
stagnant
or
deteriorate
those
which
remain
in
the
far
north
remain
below
the
level
of
civilisation
because
the
to
asia
breaks
down
but
those
which
settle
in
central
america
evolve
a
civilisation
a
large
zone
from
mexico
to
peru
was
overspread
by
this
civilisation
and
it
was
advancing
steadily
when
european
invaders
destroyed
it
and
reduced
the
civilised
peruvians
to
the
quichas
of
there
remain
the
civilisations
of
asia
and
here
we
have
a
new
and
interesting
aspect
of
the
question
how
did
these
civilisations
develop
in
asia
and
how
is
it
that
they
have
remained
stagnant
for
ages
while
europe
advanced
the
origin
of
the
asiatic
civilisations
is
obscure
the
common
idea
of
their
vast
antiquity
has
no
serious
ground
the
civilisation
of
japan
can
not
be
traced
back
beyond
about
the
eighth
century
even
then
the
population
was
probably
a
mixed
flotsam
from
neighbouring
lands
ainus
koreans
chinese
and
malays
what
was
the
character
of
the
primitive
civilisation
resulting
from
the
mixture
of
these
different
cultures
we
do
not
know
but
the
chief
elements
of
japanese
civilisation
came
later
from
china
japan
had
no
written
language
of
any
kind
until
it
received
one
from
china
about
the
sixth
century
of
the
christian
era
the
civilisation
of
china
itself
goes
back
at
least
to
about
but
we
can
not
carry
it
further
back
with
any
confidence
the
authorities
endeavouring
to
pick
their
steps
carefully
among
old
chinese
legends
are
now
generally
agreed
that
the
primitive
chinese
were
a
nomadic
tribe
which
slowly
wandered
across
asia
from
about
the
shores
of
the
caspian
sea
in
other
words
they
started
from
a
region
close
to
the
cradle
of
western
civilisation
some
students
in
fact
make
them
akin
to
the
akkadians
who
founded
civilisation
in
mesopotamia
at
all
events
they
seem
to
have
conveyed
a
higher
culture
to
the
isolated
inhabitants
of
western
asia
and
a
long
era
of
progress
followed
their
settlement
in
a
new
environment
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
however
they
have
been
enclosed
in
their
walls
and
mountains
and
seas
while
the
nations
of
the
remote
west
clashed
unceasingly
against
each
other
we
need
no
other
explanation
of
their
stagnation
to
speak
of
the
unprogressiveness
of
the
chinese
is
pure
mysticism
the
next
generation
will
see
the
civilisation
of
india
is
also
far
later
than
the
civilisation
of
the
west
and
seems
to
be
more
clearly
due
to
borrowing
from
the
west
the
primitive
peoples
who
live
on
the
hills
about
india
or
in
the
jungles
are
fragments
apparently
of
the
stone
age
inhabitants
of
india
or
their
descendants
their
culture
may
have
degenerated
under
the
adverse
conditions
of
dislodgement
from
their
home
but
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
it
was
never
high
on
these
primitive
inhabitants
of
the
plains
of
india
there
fell
somewhere
about
or
before
the
asiatic
branch
of
the
aryan
race
a
very
recent
discovery
has
strongly
confirmed
and
illumined
this
view
of
the
origin
of
indian
civilisation
explorers
in
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
capital
of
the
hittite
empire
in
north
syria
and
cappadocia
found
certain
treaties
which
had
been
concluded
about
between
the
hittites
and
the
king
of
the
aryans
the
names
of
the
deities
which
are
mentioned
in
the
treaties
seem
to
show
that
the
persian
and
indian
branches
of
the
aryan
race
were
not
yet
separated
but
formed
a
united
kingdom
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
they
seem
to
have
come
from
bactria
and
possibly
beyond
and
introduced
the
horse
hitherto
unknown
to
the
babylonians
about
it
is
surmised
by
the
experts
that
the
indian
and
persian
branches
separated
soon
after
possibly
on
account
of
religious
quarrels
and
the
branch
with
its
vedic
hymns
and
its
hinduism
wandered
eastward
and
northward
until
it
discovered
and
took
possession
of
the
indian
peninsula
the
long
isolation
of
india
since
the
cessation
of
its
commerce
with
rome
until
modern
times
explains
the
later
stagnation
of
its
civilisation
thus
the
supposed
of
the
east
after
once
establishing
civilisation
turns
out
to
be
a
question
of
geography
and
history
we
have
now
to
see
if
the
same
intelligible
principles
will
throw
light
on
the
progressiveness
of
the
western
branch
of
the
aryan
race
and
on
the
course
of
western
civilisation
generally
in
speaking
of
europeans
as
aryans
i
am
of
course
allowing
for
an
absorption
of
the
conquered
a
european
nation
is
no
more
aryan
in
strict
truth
than
the
english
are
the
first
two
centres
of
civilisation
are
found
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
the
valley
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
the
civilisations
of
egypt
and
babylon
the
oldest
in
the
world
there
is
however
a
good
deal
of
evidence
by
which
we
may
bring
these
civilisations
nearer
to
each
other
in
their
earliest
stages
so
that
we
must
not
confidently
speak
of
two
quite
independent
civilisations
the
civilisation
which
developed
on
the
euphrates
is
found
first
at
susa
on
the
hills
overlooking
the
plains
of
mesopotamia
about
a
people
akin
to
the
turkish
or
chinese
lives
among
the
hills
and
makes
the
vague
advance
from
higher
neolithic
culture
to
primitive
civilisation
about
the
same
time
the
historical
or
dynastic
civilisation
begins
in
egypt
and
some
high
authorities
such
as
flinders
petrie
believe
that
the
evidence
suggests
that
the
founders
of
this
dynastic
civilisation
came
from
the
mountainous
region
between
egypt
and
the
red
sea
from
the
northern
part
of
the
same
region
we
saw
the
ancestors
of
the
chinese
set
out
across
asia
we
have
here
a
very
suggestive
set
of
facts
in
connection
with
early
civilisation
the
region
seems
to
have
been
a
thickly
populated
centre
of
advancing
tribes
which
would
be
in
striking
accord
with
the
view
of
progress
that
i
am
following
but
we
need
not
press
the
disputed
and
obscure
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
historic
egyptians
the
remains
are
said
to
show
that
the
lower
valley
of
the
nile
which
must
have
been
but
recently
formed
by
the
river
annual
deposit
of
mud
was
a
theatre
of
contending
tribes
from
about
to
the
fertile
lands
that
had
thus
been
provided
attracted
tribes
from
east
west
and
south
and
there
is
a
great
confusion
of
primitive
cultures
on
its
soil
it
is
not
certain
that
the
race
which
eventually
conquered
and
founded
the
historical
dynasties
came
from
the
mountainous
lands
to
the
east
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
the
whole
region
fermented
with
jostling
peoples
why
it
did
so
the
previous
chapters
will
explain
it
is
the
temperate
zone
into
which
men
had
been
pressed
by
the
northern
and
from
egypt
to
the
indian
ocean
it
remained
a
fertile
of
nations
these
early
civilisations
are
merely
the
highest
point
of
neolithic
culture
the
egyptian
remains
show
a
very
gradual
development
of
pottery
ornamentation
into
which
copper
articles
are
introduced
in
time
the
dawn
of
civilisation
is
as
gradual
as
the
dawn
of
the
day
the
whole
gamut
of
culture
eolithic
palaeolithic
neolithic
and
civilised
is
struck
in
the
successive
layers
of
egyptian
remains
but
to
give
even
a
summary
of
its
historical
development
is
neither
necessary
nor
possible
here
the
maintenance
of
its
progress
is
as
intelligible
as
its
initial
advance
unlike
china
it
lay
in
the
main
region
of
human
development
and
we
find
that
even
before
it
developed
a
system
of
shipping
and
commerce
which
kept
it
in
touch
with
other
peoples
over
the
entire
region
and
helped
to
promote
development
both
in
them
and
itself
equally
intelligible
is
the
development
of
civilisation
in
mesopotamia
the
long
and
fertile
valley
which
lies
between
the
mountainous
region
and
the
southern
desert
is
like
the
valley
of
the
nile
a
quite
recent
formation
the
rivers
have
gradually
formed
it
with
their
deposit
in
the
course
of
the
last
ten
thousand
years
as
this
rich
soil
became
covered
with
vegetation
it
attracted
the
mountaineers
from
the
north
as
i
said
the
earliest
centre
of
the
civilisation
which
was
to
culminate
in
babylon
and
nineveh
is
traced
at
susa
on
the
hills
to
the
north
about
the
akkadians
highlanders
or
sumerians
the
turanian
people
who
established
this
civilisation
descended
upon
the
rivers
and
about
set
up
the
early
cities
of
mesopotamia
as
in
the
case
of
egypt
again
more
tribes
were
attracted
to
the
fertile
region
and
by
about
we
find
that
semitic
tribes
from
the
north
have
superseded
the
sumerians
and
taken
over
their
civilisation
in
these
ancient
civilisations
developing
in
touch
with
each
other
and
surrounded
by
great
numbers
of
peoples
at
the
high
neolithic
level
from
which
they
had
themselves
started
culture
advanced
rapidly
not
only
science
art
literature
commerce
law
and
social
forms
were
developed
but
moral
idealism
reached
a
height
that
compares
well
even
with
that
of
modern
times
the
recovery
in
our
time
of
the
actual
remains
of
egypt
and
babylon
has
corrected
much
of
the
libellous
legend
which
found
its
way
into
greek
and
european
literature
concerning
those
ancient
civilisations
but
as
culture
advances
human
development
becomes
so
complex
that
we
must
refrain
from
attempting
to
pursue
even
in
summary
its
many
outgrowths
the
evolution
of
morality
of
art
of
religion
of
polity
and
of
literature
would
each
require
a
whole
volume
for
satisfactory
treatment
all
that
we
can
do
here
is
to
show
how
the
modern
world
and
its
progressive
culture
are
related
to
these
ancient
empires
the
aphorism
that
all
light
comes
from
the
east
may
at
times
be
pressed
too
literally
to
suggest
that
western
peoples
have
done
no
more
than
receive
and
develop
the
culture
of
the
older
east
would
be
at
once
unscientific
and
unhistorical
by
the
close
of
the
neolithic
age
a
great
number
of
peoples
had
reached
the
threshold
of
civilisation
and
it
would
be
extremely
improbable
that
in
only
two
parts
of
the
world
the
conditions
would
be
found
of
further
progress
that
the
culture
of
these
older
empires
has
enriched
europe
and
had
a
great
share
in
its
civilisation
is
one
of
the
most
obvious
of
historical
truths
but
we
must
not
seek
to
confine
the
action
of
later
peoples
to
a
mere
borrowing
of
arts
or
institutions
yet
some
recent
historical
writers
in
their
eagerness
to
set
up
indigenous
civilisations
apart
from
those
of
egypt
and
mesopotamia
pass
to
the
opposite
extreme
we
are
prepared
to
find
civilisation
developing
wherever
the
situation
of
a
people
exposes
it
to
sufficient
stimulation
and
we
do
find
advance
made
among
many
peoples
apart
from
contact
with
the
great
southern
empires
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
use
of
bronze
is
due
first
to
the
southern
nations
or
to
some
european
people
but
the
invention
of
iron
weapons
is
most
probably
due
to
european
initiative
again
it
is
now
not
believed
that
the
alphabets
of
europe
are
derived
from
the
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
though
it
is
an
open
question
whether
they
were
not
derived
through
phoenicia
from
certain
signs
which
we
find
on
ancient
egyptian
pottery
if
we
take
first
a
broad
view
of
the
later
course
of
civilisation
we
see
at
a
glance
the
general
relation
of
east
and
west
some
difficulty
would
arise
if
we
pressed
as
to
the
exact
stage
in
which
a
nation
may
be
said
to
become
civilised
but
we
may
follow
the
general
usage
of
archaeologists
and
historians
they
tell
us
then
that
civilisation
first
appears
in
egypt
about
settled
civilisation
about
and
in
the
mesopotamian
region
about
we
next
find
neolithic
culture
passing
into
what
may
be
called
civilisation
in
crete
and
the
neighbouring
islands
some
time
between
and
or
two
thousand
years
after
the
development
of
egyptian
commerce
in
that
region
we
can
not
say
whether
this
civilisation
in
the
aegean
sea
preceded
others
which
we
afterwards
find
on
the
asiatic
mainland
the
beginning
of
the
hittite
empire
in
asia
minor
and
of
phoenician
culture
is
as
yet
unknown
but
we
can
say
that
there
was
as
yet
no
civilisation
in
europe
it
is
not
until
after
that
civilisation
is
established
in
greece
mycenae
and
tiryns
as
an
offshoot
of
aegean
culture
later
still
it
appears
among
the
etruscans
of
italy
to
which
as
we
know
both
egyptian
and
aegean
vessels
sailed
in
other
words
the
course
of
civilisation
is
very
plainly
from
east
to
west
but
we
must
be
careful
not
to
imagine
that
this
represents
a
mere
transplantation
of
southern
culture
on
a
rude
northern
stock
the
whole
region
to
the
east
of
the
mediterranean
was
just
as
fitted
to
develop
a
civilisation
as
the
valley
of
the
nile
it
swarmed
with
peoples
having
the
latest
neolithic
culture
and
as
they
advanced
and
developed
navigation
the
territory
of
many
of
them
became
the
high
road
of
more
advanced
peoples
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
the
easiest
line
of
expansion
for
a
growing
people
was
westward
the
ocean
lay
to
the
right
of
the
babylonians
and
the
country
north
and
south
was
not
inviting
the
calmer
mediterranean
with
its
fertile
shores
was
the
appointed
field
of
expansion
the
land
route
from
egypt
lay
not
to
the
dreary
west
in
africa
but
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
mediterranean
through
syria
and
asia
minor
the
land
route
from
babylon
lay
across
northern
syria
and
asia
minor
the
sea
route
had
crete
for
its
first
and
most
conspicuous
station
hence
the
gradual
appearance
of
civilisation
in
phoenicia
cappadocia
lydia
and
the
greek
islands
is
a
normal
and
natural
outcome
of
the
geographical
conditions
but
we
must
dismiss
the
later
asiatic
civilisations
whose
remains
are
fast
coming
to
light
very
briefly
phoenicia
probably
had
less
part
in
the
general
advance
than
was
formerly
supposed
now
that
we
have
discovered
a
powerful
civilisation
in
the
greek
islands
themselves
we
see
that
it
would
keep
tyre
and
sidon
in
check
until
it
fell
into
decay
about
after
that
date
for
a
few
centuries
phoenicia
had
a
great
influence
on
the
development
of
europe
the
hittites
on
the
other
hand
are
as
yet
imperfectly
known
their
main
region
was
cappadocia
where
at
least
as
far
back
as
they
developed
so
characteristic
a
civilisation
that
its
documents
or
inscriptions
are
almost
undecipherable
they
at
one
time
overran
the
whole
of
asia
minor
other
peoples
such
as
the
elamites
represent
similar
offshoots
of
the
fermenting
culture
of
the
region
the
hebrews
were
probably
a
small
and
unimportant
group
settled
close
round
jerusalem
until
a
few
centuries
before
the
christian
era
they
then
assimilated
the
culture
of
the
more
powerful
nations
which
crossed
and
recrossed
their
territory
the
persians
were
as
we
saw
a
branch
of
the
aryan
family
which
slowly
advanced
between
and
and
then
inherited
the
empire
of
dying
babylon
the
most
interesting
and
one
of
the
most
recently
discovered
of
these
older
civilisations
was
the
aegean
its
chief
centre
was
crete
but
it
spread
over
many
of
the
neighbouring
islands
its
art
and
its
script
are
so
distinctive
that
we
must
recognise
it
as
a
native
development
not
a
transplantation
of
egyptian
culture
its
ruins
show
it
gradually
emerging
from
the
neolithic
stage
about
when
egyptian
commerce
was
well
developed
in
its
seas
somewhere
about
the
whole
of
the
islands
seem
to
have
been
brought
under
the
cretan
monarchy
and
the
concentration
of
wealth
and
power
led
to
a
remarkable
artistic
development
on
native
lines
we
find
in
crete
the
remains
of
splendid
palaces
with
advanced
sanitary
systems
and
a
great
luxuriance
of
ornamentation
it
was
this
civilisation
which
founded
the
centre
at
mycenae
on
the
greek
mainland
about
the
middle
of
the
second
millennium
but
our
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
european
civilisation
does
not
demand
any
extensive
description
of
the
aegean
culture
and
its
mycenaean
offshoot
it
was
utterly
destroyed
between
and
and
this
was
probably
done
by
the
aryan
ancestors
of
the
later
greeks
or
hellenes
about
the
time
when
one
branch
of
the
aryans
was
descending
upon
india
and
another
preparing
to
rival
decaying
babylonia
the
third
branch
overran
europe
it
seems
to
have
been
a
branch
of
these
that
swept
down
the
greek
peninsula
and
crossed
the
sea
to
sack
and
destroy
the
centres
of
aegean
culture
another
branch
poured
down
the
italian
peninsula
another
settled
in
the
region
of
the
baltic
and
would
prove
the
source
of
the
germanic
nations
another
the
celtic
advanced
to
the
west
of
europe
the
mingling
of
this
population
with
the
earlier
inhabitants
provided
the
material
of
the
nations
of
modern
europe
our
last
page
in
the
story
of
the
earth
must
be
a
short
account
of
its
civilisation
the
first
branch
to
become
civilised
and
to
carry
culture
to
a
greater
height
than
the
older
nations
had
ever
done
was
the
hellenes
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
speculate
on
the
genius
of
the
hellenes
or
even
to
enlarge
on
the
natural
advantages
of
the
lower
part
of
the
peninsula
which
they
occupied
a
glance
at
the
map
will
explain
why
european
civilisation
began
in
greece
the
hellenes
had
penetrated
the
region
in
which
there
was
constant
contact
with
all
the
varied
cultures
of
the
older
world
although
they
destroyed
the
aegean
culture
they
could
not
live
amidst
its
ruins
without
receiving
some
influence
then
the
traders
of
phoenicia
triumphing
in
the
fall
of
their
aegean
rivals
brought
the
great
pacific
cultural
influence
of
commerce
to
bear
on
them
after
some
hundreds
of
years
of
internal
trouble
barbaric
quarrels
and
fresh
arrivals
from
the
north
greece
began
to
wear
an
aspect
of
civilisation
many
of
the
greeks
passed
to
asia
minor
as
they
increased
and
freed
from
the
despotism
of
tradition
in
living
contact
with
the
luxury
and
culture
of
persia
which
had
advanced
as
far
as
europe
they
evolved
the
fine
civilisation
of
the
greek
colonies
and
reacted
on
the
motherland
finally
there
came
the
heroic
struggle
against
the
persian
invaders
and
from
the
ashes
of
their
early
civilisation
arose
the
marble
city
which
will
never
die
in
the
memory
of
europe
the
romans
had
meantime
been
advancing
we
may
neglect
the
older
italian
culture
as
it
had
far
less
to
do
with
the
making
of
italy
and
europe
than
the
influence
of
the
east
by
about
rome
was
a
small
kingdom
with
a
primitive
civilisation
busy
in
subduing
the
neighbouring
tribes
who
threatened
its
security
and
unconsciously
gathering
the
seeds
of
culture
which
some
of
them
contained
by
about
the
vigour
of
the
romans
had
united
all
the
tribes
of
italy
in
a
powerful
republic
and
wealth
began
to
accumulate
at
rome
not
far
to
the
east
was
the
glittering
civilisation
of
greece
to
the
south
was
carthage
a
busy
centre
of
commerce
navigation
and
art
and
from
the
mediterranean
came
processions
of
ships
bringing
stimulating
fragments
and
stories
of
the
hoary
culture
of
the
east
within
another
two
hundred
years
rome
annihilated
carthage
paralysed
and
overran
greece
and
sent
its
legions
over
the
asiatic
provinces
of
the
older
empires
by
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
all
that
remained
of
the
culture
of
the
old
world
was
gathered
in
rome
all
the
philosophies
of
greece
all
the
religions
of
persia
and
judea
and
egypt
all
the
luxuries
and
vices
of
the
east
found
a
home
in
it
every
stream
of
culture
that
had
started
from
the
later
and
higher
neolithic
age
had
ended
in
rome
and
in
the
meantime
rome
had
begun
to
disseminate
its
heritage
over
europe
its
legions
poured
over
spain
and
gaul
and
germany
and
britain
its
administrators
and
judges
and
teachers
followed
the
eagles
and
set
up
schools
and
and
theatres
and
baths
and
temples
it
flung
broad
roads
to
the
north
of
britain
and
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
danube
under
the
shelter
of
the
roman
peace
the
peoples
of
europe
could
spare
men
from
the
plough
and
the
sword
for
the
cultivation
of
art
and
letters
the
civilisations
of
britain
france
germany
spain
north
africa
and
italy
were
ushered
into
the
calendar
of
mankind
and
were
ready
to
bear
the
burden
when
the
mighty
city
on
the
tiber
let
the
sceptre
fall
from
its
enfeebled
hands
rome
fell
the
more
accurate
historians
of
our
time
correct
the
old
legend
of
death
from
senile
decay
or
from
the
effect
of
dissipation
races
of
men
like
races
of
animals
do
not
die
they
are
killed
the
physical
deterioration
of
the
citizens
of
rome
was
a
small
matter
in
its
fall
fiscal
and
imperial
blunders
loosed
the
frame
of
its
empire
the
resources
were
still
there
but
there
was
none
to
organise
and
unify
them
the
imperial
system
or
chaos
ruined
rome
and
just
when
the
demoralisation
was
greatest
and
the
teutonic
tribes
at
the
frontiers
were
most
numerous
and
powerful
an
accident
shook
the
system
a
fierce
and
numerous
people
from
asia
the
huns
wandered
into
europe
threw
themselves
on
the
teutonic
tribes
and
precipitated
these
tribes
upon
the
empire
a
diocletian
might
still
have
saved
the
empire
but
there
was
none
to
guide
it
the
northern
barbarians
trod
its
civilisation
underfoot
and
europe
passed
into
the
dark
ages
one
more
application
of
the
evolutionary
principle
and
we
close
the
story
the
barbarians
the
goths
and
vandals
and
their
germanic
cousins
were
barbaric
only
in
comparison
with
the
art
and
letters
of
rome
they
had
law
polity
and
ideals
european
civilisation
owes
elements
to
them
as
well
as
to
rome
to
say
simply
that
the
barbarians
destroyed
the
institutions
of
rome
is
no
adequate
explanation
of
the
dark
ages
let
us
see
rather
how
the
dark
ages
were
enlightened
it
is
now
fully
recognised
that
the
reawakening
of
europe
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
was
very
largely
due
to
a
fresh
with
the
older
civilisations
the
arabs
had
on
becoming
civilised
learned
from
the
nestorians
who
had
been
driven
out
of
the
greek
world
for
their
heresies
the
ancient
culture
of
greece
they
enshrined
it
in
a
brilliant
civilisation
which
it
inspired
them
to
establish
by
the
ninth
century
this
civilisation
was
exhibited
in
spain
by
its
moorish
conquerors
and
as
its
splendour
increased
it
attracted
the
attention
of
europe
some
christian
scholars
visited
spain
as
time
went
on
but
the
jews
were
the
great
intermediaries
in
disseminating
its
culture
in
europe
there
is
now
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
rebirth
of
positive
learning
especially
of
science
in
europe
was
very
largely
due
to
the
literature
of
the
moors
and
their
luxury
and
splendour
gave
an
impulse
to
european
art
europe
entered
upon
the
remarkable
intellectual
period
known
as
scholasticism
besides
this
stimulus
it
must
be
remembered
the
scholars
of
europe
had
at
least
a
certain
number
of
old
latin
writers
whose
works
had
survived
the
general
wreck
of
culture
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
awakening
of
europe
was
completed
the
turks
took
constantinople
and
drove
large
numbers
of
greek
scholars
to
italy
out
of
this
catastrophe
issued
the
great
renaissance
or
rebirth
of
art
science
and
letters
in
italy
and
then
in
france
germany
and
england
in
the
new
intellectual
ferment
there
appeared
the
great
artists
great
thinkers
and
inventors
and
great
navigators
who
led
the
race
to
fresh
heights
the
invention
of
printing
alone
would
almost
have
changed
the
face
of
europe
but
it
was
accompanied
by
a
hundred
other
inventions
and
discoveries
by
great
liberating
and
stimulating
movements
like
the
reformation
by
the
growth
of
free
and
wealthy
cities
and
by
the
extension
of
peace
over
larger
areas
and
the
concentration
of
wealth
and
encouragement
of
art
which
the
growth
and
settlement
of
the
chief
european
powers
involved
europe
entered
upon
the
phase
of
evolution
which
we
call
modern
times
the
future
of
humanity
can
not
be
seen
even
darkly
as
in
a
glass
no
forecast
that
aspires
beyond
the
immediate
future
is
worth
considering
seriously
if
it
be
a
forecast
of
material
progress
it
is
rendered
worthless
by
the
obvious
consideration
that
if
we
knew
what
the
future
will
do
we
would
do
it
ourselves
if
it
is
a
forecast
of
intellectual
and
social
evolution
it
is
inevitably
coloured
by
the
intellectual
or
social
convictions
of
the
prophet
i
therefore
abstain
wholly
from
carrying
the
story
of
evolution
beyond
realities
but
i
would
add
two
general
considerations
which
may
enable
a
reflective
reader
to
answer
certain
questions
that
will
arise
in
his
mind
at
the
close
of
this
survey
of
the
story
of
evolution
are
we
evolving
is
man
the
last
word
of
evolution
these
are
amongst
the
commonest
questions
put
to
me
whether
man
is
or
is
not
the
last
word
of
evolution
is
merely
a
verbal
quibble
now
that
language
is
invented
and
things
have
names
one
may
say
that
the
name
man
will
cling
to
the
highest
and
most
progressive
animal
on
earth
no
matter
how
much
he
may
rise
above
the
man
of
but
if
the
question
is
whether
he
will
rise
far
above
the
civilisation
of
we
can
in
my
opinion
give
a
confident
answer
there
is
no
law
of
evolution
but
there
is
a
fact
of
evolution
ten
million
years
ago
the
highest
animal
on
the
earth
was
a
reptile
or
at
the
most
a
low
marsupial
the
authorities
tell
us
that
unless
some
cosmic
accident
intervene
the
earth
will
remain
habitable
by
man
for
at
least
ten
million
years
it
is
safe
to
conclude
that
the
man
of
that
remote
age
will
be
lifted
above
the
man
of
as
much
as
we
transcend
the
reptile
in
intelligence
and
emotion
it
is
most
probable
that
this
is
a
quite
inadequate
expression
of
the
future
advance
we
are
not
only
evolving
but
evolving
more
rapidly
than
living
thing
ever
did
before
the
pace
increases
every
century
a
calm
and
critical
review
of
our
development
inspires
a
conviction
that
a
few
centuries
will
bring
about
the
realisation
of
the
highest
dream
that
ever
haunted
the
mind
of
the
prophet
what
splendours
lie
beyond
that
the
most
soaring
imagination
can
not
have
the
dimmest
perception
and
the
last
word
must
meet
an
anxiety
that
arises
out
of
this
very
confidence
darwin
was
right
it
is
not
exclusively
but
mainly
the
struggle
for
life
that
has
begotten
higher
types
must
every
step
of
future
progress
be
won
by
fresh
and
sustained
struggle
at
least
we
may
say
that
the
notion
that
progress
in
the
future
depends
as
in
the
past
upon
the
pitting
of
flesh
against
flesh
and
tooth
against
tooth
is
a
deplorable
illusion
such
physical
struggle
is
indeed
necessary
to
evolve
and
maintain
a
type
fit
for
the
struggle
but
a
new
thing
has
come
into
the
story
of
the
earth
wisdom
and
fine
emotion
the
processes
which
begot
animal
types
in
the
past
may
be
superseded
perhaps
must
be
superseded
the
battle
of
the
future
lies
between
wit
and
wit
art
and
art
generosity
and
generosity
and
a
great
struggle
and
rivalry
may
proceed
that
will
carry
the
distinctive
powers
of
man
to
heights
yet
be
wholly
innocent
of
the
conflict
that
has
hitherto
been
the
instrument
of
progress
