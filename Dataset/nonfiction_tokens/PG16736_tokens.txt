material
and
method
if
the
writer
who
ventures
to
say
something
more
about
books
and
their
uses
is
wise
he
will
not
begin
with
an
apology
for
he
will
know
that
despite
all
that
has
been
said
and
written
on
this
engrossing
theme
the
interest
of
books
is
inexhaustible
and
that
there
is
always
a
new
constituency
to
read
them
so
rich
is
the
vitality
of
the
great
books
of
the
world
that
men
are
never
done
with
them
not
only
does
each
new
generation
read
them
but
it
is
compelled
to
form
some
judgment
of
them
in
this
way
homer
dante
shakespeare
goethe
and
their
are
always
coming
into
the
open
court
of
public
opinion
and
the
estimate
in
which
they
are
held
is
valuable
chiefly
as
affording
material
for
a
judgment
of
the
generation
which
forms
it
an
age
which
understands
and
honours
creative
artists
must
have
a
certain
breadth
of
view
and
energy
of
spirit
an
age
which
fails
to
recognise
their
significance
fails
to
recognise
the
range
and
splendour
of
life
and
has
therefore
a
certain
inferiority
we
can
not
get
away
from
the
great
books
of
the
world
because
they
preserve
and
interpret
the
life
of
the
world
they
are
inexhaustible
because
being
vitally
conceived
they
need
the
commentary
of
that
wide
experience
which
we
call
history
to
bring
out
the
full
meaning
of
the
text
they
are
our
perpetual
teachers
because
they
are
the
most
complete
expressions
in
that
concrete
form
which
we
call
art
of
the
thoughts
acts
dispositions
and
passions
of
humanity
there
is
no
getting
to
the
bottom
of
shakespeare
for
instance
or
to
the
end
of
his
possibilities
of
enriching
and
interesting
us
because
he
deals
habitually
with
that
primary
substance
of
human
life
which
remains
substantially
unchanged
through
all
the
mutations
of
racial
national
and
personal
condition
and
which
is
always
and
for
all
men
the
object
of
supreme
interest
time
which
is
the
relentless
enemy
of
all
that
is
partial
and
provisional
is
the
friend
of
shakespeare
because
it
continually
brings
to
the
student
of
his
work
illustration
and
confirmation
of
its
truth
there
are
many
things
in
his
plays
which
are
more
intelligible
and
significant
to
us
than
they
were
to
the
men
who
heard
their
musical
cadence
on
the
rude
elizabethan
stage
because
the
ripening
of
experience
has
given
the
prophetic
thought
an
historical
demonstration
and
there
are
truths
in
these
plays
which
will
be
read
with
clearer
eyes
by
the
men
of
the
next
century
than
they
are
now
read
by
us
it
is
this
prophetic
quality
in
the
books
of
power
which
silently
moves
them
forward
with
the
inaudible
advance
of
the
successive
files
in
the
ranks
of
the
generations
and
which
makes
them
contemporary
with
each
generation
for
while
the
mediæval
upon
which
dante
constructed
the
divine
comedy
becomes
obsolete
the
fundamental
thought
of
the
poet
about
human
souls
and
the
identity
of
the
deed
and
its
result
not
only
remains
true
to
experience
but
has
received
the
most
impressive
confirmation
from
subsequent
history
and
from
psychology
it
is
as
impossible
therefore
to
get
away
from
the
books
of
power
as
from
the
stars
every
new
generation
must
make
acquaintance
with
them
because
they
are
as
much
a
part
of
that
order
of
things
which
forms
the
background
of
human
life
as
nature
itself
with
every
intelligent
man
or
woman
the
question
is
not
shall
i
take
account
of
them
but
how
shall
i
get
the
most
and
the
best
out
of
them
for
my
enrichment
and
guidance
it
is
with
the
hope
of
assisting
some
readers
and
students
of
books
and
especially
those
who
are
at
the
beginning
of
the
ardours
the
delights
and
the
perplexities
of
the
that
these
chapters
are
undertaken
they
assume
nothing
on
the
part
of
the
reader
but
a
desire
to
know
the
best
that
has
been
written
they
promise
nothing
on
the
part
of
the
writer
but
a
frank
and
familiar
use
of
experience
in
a
pursuit
which
makes
it
possible
for
the
individual
life
to
learn
the
lessons
which
universal
life
has
learned
and
to
piece
out
its
limited
personal
experience
with
the
experience
of
humanity
one
who
loves
books
like
one
who
loves
a
particular
bit
of
a
country
is
always
eager
to
make
others
see
what
he
sees
that
there
have
been
other
lovers
of
books
and
views
before
him
does
not
put
him
in
an
apologetic
mood
there
can
not
be
too
many
lovers
of
the
best
things
in
these
pessimistic
days
when
to
have
the
power
of
loving
anything
is
beginning
to
be
a
great
and
rare
gift
the
word
love
in
this
connection
is
significant
of
a
very
definite
attitude
toward
books
an
attitude
not
uncritical
since
it
is
love
of
the
best
only
but
an
attitude
which
implies
more
intimacy
and
receptivity
than
the
purely
critical
temper
makes
possible
an
attitude
moreover
which
expects
and
invites
something
more
than
instruction
or
entertainment
both
valuable
wholesome
and
necessary
and
yet
neither
descriptive
of
the
richest
function
which
the
book
fulfils
to
the
reader
to
love
a
book
is
to
invite
an
intimacy
with
it
which
opens
the
way
to
its
heart
one
of
the
wisest
of
modern
readers
has
said
that
the
most
important
characteristic
of
the
real
critic
the
man
who
penetrates
the
secret
of
a
work
of
art
is
the
ability
to
admire
greatly
and
there
is
but
a
short
step
between
admiration
and
love
and
as
if
to
emphasise
the
value
of
a
quality
so
rare
among
critics
the
same
wise
reader
who
was
also
the
greatest
writer
of
modern
times
says
also
that
where
keen
perception
unites
with
good
will
and
love
it
gets
at
the
heart
of
man
and
the
world
nay
it
may
hope
to
reach
the
highest
goal
of
all
to
get
at
the
heart
of
that
knowledge
life
and
beauty
which
are
stored
in
books
is
surely
one
way
of
reaching
the
highest
goal
that
goal
in
goethe
thought
was
the
complete
development
of
the
individual
life
through
thought
feeling
and
action
an
aim
often
misunderstood
but
which
seen
on
all
sides
is
certainly
the
very
highest
disclosed
to
the
human
spirit
and
the
method
of
attaining
this
result
was
the
process
also
often
and
widely
misunderstood
of
culture
this
word
carries
with
it
the
implication
of
natural
vital
growth
but
it
has
been
confused
with
an
artificial
mechanical
process
supposed
to
be
practised
as
a
kind
of
esoteric
cult
by
a
small
group
of
people
who
hold
themselves
apart
from
common
human
experiences
and
fellowships
symonds
concerning
whose
representative
character
as
a
man
of
culture
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
said
that
he
had
read
with
some
care
the
newspaper
accounts
of
his
culture
and
that
so
far
as
he
could
gather
his
newspaper
critics
held
the
opinion
that
culture
is
a
kind
of
knapsack
which
a
man
straps
on
his
back
and
in
which
he
places
a
vast
amount
of
information
gathered
more
or
less
at
random
in
all
parts
of
the
world
there
was
of
course
a
touch
of
humour
in
description
of
the
newspaper
conception
of
culture
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
culture
has
been
regarded
by
a
great
many
people
either
as
a
kind
of
intellectual
refinement
so
highly
specialised
as
to
verge
on
fastidiousness
or
as
a
large
accumulation
of
miscellaneous
information
now
the
process
of
culture
is
an
unfolding
and
enrichment
of
the
human
spirit
by
conforming
to
the
laws
of
its
own
growth
and
the
result
is
a
broad
rich
free
human
life
culture
is
never
quantity
it
is
always
quality
of
knowledge
it
is
never
an
extension
of
ourselves
by
additions
from
without
it
is
always
enlargement
of
ourselves
by
development
from
within
it
is
never
something
acquired
it
is
always
something
possessed
it
is
never
a
result
of
accumulation
it
is
always
a
result
of
growth
that
which
characterises
the
man
of
culture
is
not
the
extent
of
his
information
but
the
quality
of
his
mind
it
is
not
the
mass
of
things
he
knows
but
the
sanity
the
ripeness
the
soundness
of
his
nature
a
man
may
have
great
knowledge
and
remain
uncultivated
a
man
may
have
comparatively
limited
knowledge
and
be
genuinely
cultivated
there
have
been
famous
scholars
who
have
remained
crude
unripe
inharmonious
in
their
intellectual
life
and
there
have
been
men
of
small
scholarship
who
have
found
all
the
fruits
of
culture
the
man
of
culture
is
he
who
has
so
absorbed
what
he
knows
that
it
is
part
of
himself
his
knowledge
has
not
only
enriched
specific
faculties
it
has
enriched
him
his
entire
nature
has
come
to
ripe
and
sound
maturity
this
personal
enrichment
is
the
very
highest
and
finest
result
of
intimacy
with
books
compared
with
it
the
instruction
information
refreshment
and
entertainment
which
books
afford
are
of
secondary
importance
the
great
service
they
render
us
the
greatest
service
that
can
be
rendered
us
is
the
enlargement
enrichment
and
unfolding
of
ourselves
they
nourish
and
develop
that
mysterious
personality
which
lies
behind
all
thought
feeling
and
action
that
central
force
within
us
which
feeds
the
specific
activities
through
which
we
give
out
ourselves
to
the
world
and
in
giving
find
and
recover
ourselves
chapter
ii
time
and
place
to
get
at
the
heart
of
shakespeare
plays
and
to
secure
for
ourselves
the
material
and
the
development
of
culture
which
are
contained
in
them
is
not
the
work
of
a
day
or
of
a
year
it
is
the
work
and
the
joy
of
a
lifetime
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
harmonious
unfolding
of
the
human
spirit
there
is
a
choice
of
methods
but
there
are
no
short
cuts
no
man
can
seize
the
fruits
of
culture
prematurely
they
are
not
to
be
had
by
pulling
down
the
boughs
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
so
that
he
who
runs
may
pluck
as
he
pleases
culture
is
not
to
be
had
by
programme
by
limited
courses
of
reading
by
correspondence
or
by
following
short
prescribed
lines
of
home
study
these
are
all
good
in
their
degree
of
thoroughness
of
method
and
worth
of
standards
but
they
are
impotent
to
impart
an
enrichment
which
is
below
and
beyond
mere
acquirement
because
culture
is
not
knowledge
but
wisdom
not
quantity
of
learning
but
quality
not
mass
of
information
but
ripeness
and
soundness
of
temper
spirit
and
nature
time
is
an
essential
element
in
the
process
of
securing
it
a
man
may
acquire
information
with
great
rapidity
but
no
man
can
hasten
his
growth
if
the
fruit
is
forced
the
flavour
is
lost
to
get
into
the
secret
of
shakespeare
therefore
one
must
take
time
one
must
grow
into
that
secret
this
does
not
mean
however
that
the
best
things
to
be
gotten
out
of
books
are
reserved
for
people
of
leisure
on
the
contrary
they
are
oftenest
possessed
by
those
whose
labours
are
many
and
whose
leisure
is
limited
one
may
give
his
whole
life
to
the
pursuit
of
this
kind
of
excellence
but
one
does
not
need
to
give
his
whole
time
to
it
culture
is
cumulative
it
grows
steadily
in
the
man
who
takes
the
fruitful
attitude
toward
life
and
art
it
is
secured
by
the
clear
purpose
which
so
utilises
all
the
spare
minutes
that
they
practically
constitute
an
unbroken
duration
of
time
james
smetham
the
english
artist
feeling
keenly
the
imperfections
of
his
training
formulated
a
plan
of
study
combining
art
literature
and
the
religious
life
and
devoted
years
to
working
it
out
goethe
spent
more
than
sixty
years
in
the
process
of
developing
himself
harmoniously
on
all
sides
and
few
men
have
wasted
less
time
than
he
and
yet
in
the
case
of
each
of
these
rigorous
and
faithful
students
there
were
other
and
for
long
periods
more
engrossing
occupations
any
one
who
knows
men
widely
will
recall
those
whose
persistent
utilisation
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
time
which
many
people
regard
as
of
too
little
value
to
save
by
using
has
given
their
minds
and
their
lives
that
peculiar
distinction
of
taste
manner
and
speech
which
belong
to
genuine
culture
it
is
not
wealth
of
time
but
what
gladstone
has
aptly
called
thrift
of
time
which
brings
ripeness
of
mind
within
reach
of
the
great
mass
of
men
and
women
the
man
who
has
learned
the
value
of
five
minutes
has
gone
a
long
way
toward
making
himself
a
master
of
life
and
its
arts
the
thrift
of
time
says
the
english
statesman
will
repay
in
after
life
with
a
usury
of
profit
beyond
your
most
sanguine
dreams
and
waste
of
it
will
make
you
dwindle
alike
in
intellectual
and
moral
stature
beyond
your
darkest
reckoning
and
matthew
arnold
has
put
the
same
truth
into
words
which
touch
the
subject
in
hand
still
more
closely
the
plea
that
this
or
that
man
has
no
time
for
culture
will
vanish
as
soon
as
we
desire
culture
so
much
that
we
begin
to
examine
seriously
into
our
present
use
of
time
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
mass
of
men
give
to
unplanned
and
desultory
reading
of
books
and
newspapers
an
amount
of
time
which
if
intelligently
and
thoughtfully
given
to
the
best
books
would
secure
in
the
long
run
the
best
fruits
of
culture
there
is
no
magic
about
this
process
of
enriching
one
self
by
absorbing
the
best
books
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
sound
habits
patiently
formed
and
persistently
kept
up
making
the
most
of
time
is
the
first
of
these
habits
utilising
the
spare
hours
the
unemployed
minutes
no
less
than
those
longer
periods
which
the
more
fortunate
enjoy
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
in
this
way
however
one
must
have
his
book
at
hand
when
the
precious
minute
arrives
there
must
be
no
fumbling
for
the
right
volume
no
waste
of
time
because
one
is
uncertain
what
to
take
up
next
the
waste
of
opportunity
which
leaves
so
many
people
intellectually
barren
who
ought
to
be
intellectually
rich
is
due
to
neglect
to
decide
in
advance
what
direction
one
reading
shall
take
and
neglect
to
keep
the
book
of
the
moment
close
at
hand
the
biographer
of
lucy
larcom
tells
us
that
the
aspiring
girl
pinned
all
manner
of
selections
of
prose
and
verse
which
she
wished
to
learn
at
the
sides
of
the
window
beside
which
her
loom
was
placed
and
in
this
way
in
the
intervals
of
work
she
familiarised
herself
with
a
great
deal
of
good
literature
a
certain
man
now
widely
known
spent
his
boyhood
on
a
farm
and
largely
educated
himself
he
learned
the
rudiments
of
latin
in
the
evening
and
carried
on
his
study
during
working
hours
by
pinning
ten
lines
from
virgil
on
his
plough
a
method
of
refreshment
much
superior
to
that
which
homer
furnished
the
ploughman
in
the
passage
in
the
description
of
the
shield
these
are
extreme
cases
but
they
are
capital
illustrations
of
the
immense
power
of
enrichment
which
is
inherent
in
fragments
of
time
pieced
together
by
intelligent
purpose
and
persistent
habit
this
faculty
of
draining
all
the
rivulets
of
knowledge
by
the
way
was
strikingly
developed
by
a
man
of
surpassing
eloquence
and
tireless
activity
he
was
never
a
methodical
student
in
the
sense
of
following
rigidly
a
single

himself
with
any

which
was
at

if
books
were

elbow
he
read
them
if

he

if

was

he

briefest
possible
time
if
he
travelled

he
sat

he
had
a
spare
hour
in

shall
i
tell
you
the
secret
of
the
true
scholar
says
emerson
it
is
this
every
man
i
meet
is
my
master
in
some
point
and
in
that
i
learn
of
him
the
man
who
is
bent
on
getting
the
most
out
of
life
in
order
that
he
may
make
his
own
nature
rich
and
productive
will
learn
to
free
himself
largely
from
dependence
on
conditions
the
power
of
concentration
which
issues
from
a
resolute
purpose
and
is
confirmed
by
habits
formed
to
give
that
purpose
effectiveness
is
of
more
value
than
undisturbed
hours
and
the
solitude
of
a
library
it
is
of
more
value
because
it
takes
the
place
of
things
which
can
not
always
be
at
command
to
learn
how
to
treat
the
odds
and
ends
of
hours
so
that
they
constitute
for
practical
purposes
an
unbroken
duration
of
time
is
to
emancipate
one
self
from
dependence
on
particular
times
and
to
appropriate
all
time
to
one
use
and
in
like
manner
to
accustom
one
self
to
make
use
of
all
places
however
thronged
and
public
as
if
they
were
private
and
secluded
is
to
free
one
self
from
bondage
to
a
particular
locality
or
to
surroundings
specially
chosen
for
the
purpose
those
who
have
abundance
of
leisure
to
spend
in
their
libraries
are
beyond
the
need
of
suggestions
as
to
the
use
of
time
and
place
but
those
whose
culture
must
be
secured
incidentally
as
it
were
need
not
despair
they
have
shining
examples
of
successful
use
of
limited
opportunities
about
them
it
is
not
only
possible
to
make
all
time
enrich
us
but
to
use
all
space
as
if
it
were
our
own
to
have
a
book
in
one
pocket
and
the
power
of
fastening
one
mind
upon
it
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
object
or
interest
is
to
be
independent
of
the
library
with
its
unbroken
quietness
it
is
to
carry
the
library
with
us
not
only
the
book
but
the
repose
one
bright
june
morning
a
young
man
who
happened
to
be
waiting
at
a
rural
station
to
take
a
train
discovered
one
of
the
foremost
of
american
writers
who
was
all
things
considered
perhaps
the
most
richly
cultivated
man
whom
the
country
has
yet
produced
sitting
on
the
steps
intent
upon
a
book
and
entirely
oblivious
of
his
surroundings
the
young
man
reverence
for
the
poet
and
critic
filled
him
with
desire
to
know
what
book
had
such
power
of
beguiling
into
forgetfulness
one
of
the
noblest
minds
of
the
time
he
affirmed
within
himself
that
it
must
be
a
novel
he
ventured
to
approach
near
enough
to
read
the
title
holding
rightly
enough
that
a
book
is
not
personal
property
and
that
his
act
involved
no
violation
of
privacy
he
discovered
that
the
great
man
was
reading
a
greek
play
with
such
relish
and
abandon
that
he
had
turned
a
railway
station
into
a
private
library
one
of
the
foremost
of
american
novelists
a
man
of
real
literary
insight
and
of
genuine
charm
of
style
says
that
he
can
write
as
comfortably
on
a
trunk
in
a
room
at
a
hotel
waiting
to
be
called
for
a
train
as
in
his
own
library
there
is
a
good
deal
of
discipline
behind
such
a
power
of
concentration
as
that
illustrated
in
both
these
cases
but
it
is
a
power
which
can
be
cultivated
by
any
man
or
woman
of
resolution
once
acquired
the
exercise
of
it
becomes
both
easy
and
delightful
it
transforms
travel
waiting
and
dreary
surroundings
into
one
rich
opportunity
the
man
who
has
the
tempest
in
his
pocket
and
can
surrender
himself
to
its
spell
can
afford
to
lose
time
on
cars
ferries
and
at
stations
for
the
world
has
become
an
extension
of
his
library
and
wherever
he
is
he
is
at
home
with
his
purpose
and
himself
chapter
iii
meditation
and
imagination
there
is
a
book
in
the
british
museum
which
would
have
for
many
people
a
greater
value
than
any
other
single
volume
in
the
world
it
is
a
copy
of
florio
translation
of
montaigne
and
it
bears
shakespeare
autograph
on
a
flyleaf
there
are
other
books
which
must
have
had
the
same
ownership
among
them
were
holinshed
chronicles
and
north
translation
of
plutarch
shakespeare
would
have
laid
posterity
under
still
greater
obligations
if
that
were
possible
if
in
some
autobiographic
mood
he
had
told
us
how
he
read
these
books
for
never
surely
were
books
read
with
greater
insight
and
with
more
complete
absorption
indeed
the
fruits
of
this
reading
were
so
rich
and
ripe
that
the
books
from
which
their
juices
came
seem
but
dry
husks
and
shells
in
comparison
the
reader
drained
the
writer
dry
of
every
particle
of
suggestiveness
and
then
recreated
the
material
in
new
and
imperishable
forms
the
process
of
reproduction
was
individual
and
is
not
to
be
shared
by
others
it
was
the
expression
of
that
rare
and
inexplicable
personal
energy
which
we
call
genius
but
the
process
of
absorption
may
be
shared
by
all
who
care
to
submit
to
the
discipline
which
it
involves
it
is
clear
that
shakespeare
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
possess
what
he
read
he
not
only
remembered
it
but
he
incorporated
it
into
himself
no
other
kind
of
reading
could
have
brought
the
east
out
of
its
grave
with
its
rich
and
languorous
atmosphere
steeping
the
senses
in
the
charm
of
cleopatra
or
recalled
the
massive
and
powerfully
organised
life
of
rome
about
the
person
of
the
great
cæsar
shakespeare
read
his
books
with
such
insight
and
imagination
that
they
became
part
of
himself
and
so
far
as
this
process
is
concerned
the
reader
of
can
follow
in
his
steps
the
majority
of
people
have
not
learned
this
secret
they
read
for
information
or
for
refreshment
they
do
not
read
for
enrichment
feeding
one
nature
at
all
the
sources
of
life
browsing
at
will
on
all
the
uplands
of
knowledge
and
thought
do
not
bear
the
fruit
of
acquirement
only
they
put
us
into
personal
possession
of
the
vitality
the
truth
and
the
beauty
about
us
a
man
may
know
the
plays
of
shakespeare
accurately
as
regards
their
order
form
construction
and
language
and
yet
remain
almost
without
knowledge
of
what
shakespeare
was
at
heart
and
of
his
significance
in
the
history
of
the
human
soul
it
is
this
deeper
knowledge
however
which
is
essential
for
culture
for
culture
is
such
an
appropriation
of
knowledge
that
it
becomes
a
part
of
ourselves
it
is
no
longer
something
added
by
the
memory
it
is
something
possessed
by
the
soul
a
pedant
is
formed
by
his
memory
a
man
of
culture
is
formed
by
the
habit
of
meditation
and
by
the
constant
use
of
the
imagination
an
alert
and
curious
man
goes
through
the
world
taking
note
of
all
that
passes
under
his
eyes
and
collects
a
great
mass
of
information
which
is
in
no
sense
incorporated
into
his
own
mind
but
remains
a
definite
territory
outside
his
own
nature
which
he
has
annexed
a
man
of
receptive
mind
and
heart
on
the
other
hand
meditating
on
what
he
sees
and
getting
at
its
meaning
by
the
of
the
imagination
discovers
the
law
behind
the
phenomena
the
truth
behind
the
fact
the
vital
force
which
flows
through
all
things
and
gives
them
their
significance
the
first
man
gains
information
the
second
gains
culture
the
pedant
pours
out
an
endless
succession
of
facts
with
a
monotonous
uniformity
of
emphasis
and
exhausts
while
he
instructs
the
man
of
culture
gives
us
a
few
facts
luminous
in
their
relation
to
one
another
and
freshens
and
stimulates
by
bringing
us
into
contact
with
ideas
and
with
life
to
get
at
the
heart
of
books
we
must
live
with
and
in
them
we
must
make
them
our
constant
companions
we
must
turn
them
over
and
over
in
thought
slowly
penetrating
their
innermost
meaning
and
when
we
possess
their
thought
we
must
work
it
into
our
own
thought
the
reading
of
a
real
book
ought
to
be
an
event
in
one
history
it
ought
to
enlarge
the
vision
deepen
the
base
of
conviction
and
add
to
the
reader
whatever
knowledge
insight
beauty
and
power
it
contains
it
is
possible
to
spend
years
of
study
on
what
may
be
called
the
externals
of
the
divine
comedy
and
remain
unaffected
in
nature
by
this
contact
with
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
the
spirit
of
man
as
well
as
of
the
art
of
literature
it
is
also
possible
to
so
absorb
thought
and
so
saturate
one
self
with
the
life
of
the
poem
as
to
add
to
one
individual
capital
of
thought
and
experience
all
that
the
poet
discerned
in
that
deep
heart
of
his
and
wrought
out
of
that
intense
and
tragic
experience
but
this
permanent
and
personal
possession
can
be
acquired
by
those
alone
who
brood
over
the
poem
and
recreate
it
within
themselves
by
the
play
of
the
imagination
upon
it
a
visitor
was
shown
into
lowell
room
one
evening
not
many
years
ago
and
found
him
barricaded
behind
rows
of
open
books
they
covered
the
table
and
were
spread
out
on
the
floor
in
an
irregular
but
magic
circle
still
studying
dante
said
the
intruder
into
the
workshop
of
as
true
a
man
of
culture
as
we
have
known
on
this
continent
yes
was
the
prompt
reply
always
studying
dante
a
man
intellectual
character
is
determined
by
what
he
habitually
thinks
about
the
mind
can
not
always
be
consciously
directed
to
definite
ends
it
has
hours
of
relaxation
there
are
many
hours
in
the
life
of
the
most
strenuous
and
arduous
man
when
the
mind
goes
its
own
way
and
thinks
its
own
thoughts
these
times
of
relaxation
when
the
mind
follows
its
own
bent
are
perhaps
the
most
fruitful
and
significant
periods
in
a
rich
and
noble
intellectual
life
the
real
nature
the
deeper
instincts
of
the
man
come
out
in
these
moments
as
essential
refinement
and
genuine
breeding
are
revealed
when
the
man
is
off
guard
and
acts
and
speaks
instinctively
it
is
possible
to
be
mentally
active
and
intellectually
poor
and
sterile
to
drive
the
mind
along
certain
courses
of
work
but
to
have
no
deep
life
of
thought
behind
these
calculated
activities
the
life
of
the
mind
is
rich
and
fruitful
only
when
thought
released
from
specific
tasks
flies
at
once
to
great
themes
as
its
natural
objects
of
interest
and
love
its
natural
sources
of
refreshment
and
strength
under
all
our
definite
activities
there
runs
a
stream
of
meditation
and
the
character
of
that
meditation
determines
our
wealth
or
our
poverty
our
productiveness
or
our
sterility
this
instinctive
action
of
the
mind
although
largely
unconscious
is
by
no
means
irresponsible
it
may
be
directed
and
controlled
it
may
be
turned
by
such
control
into
a
pactolian
stream
enriching
us
while
we
rest
and
ennobling
us
while
we
play
for
the
mind
may
be
trained
to
meditate
on
great
themes
instead
of
giving
itself
up
to
idle
reverie
when
it
is
released
from
work
it
may
concern
itself
with
the
highest
things
as
readily
as
with
those
which
are
insignificant
and
paltry
whoever
can
command
his
meditations
in
the
streets
along
the
country
roads
on
the
train
in
the
hours
of
relaxation
can
enrich
himself
for
all
time
without
effort
or
fatigue
for
it
is
as
easy
and
restful
to
think
about
great
things
as
about
small
ones
a
certain
lover
of
books
made
this
discovery
years
ago
and
has
turned
it
to
account
with
great
profit
to
himself
he
thought
he
discovered
in
the
faces
of
certain
great
writers
a
meditative
quality
full
of
repose
and
suggestive
of
a
constant
companionship
with
the
highest
themes
it
seemed
to
him
that
these
thinkers
who
had
done
so
much
to
liberate
his
own
thought
must
have
dwelt
habitually
with
noble
ideas
that
in
every
leisure
hour
they
must
have
turned
instinctively
to
those
deep
things
which
concern
most
closely
the
life
of
men
the
vast
majority
of
men
are
so
absorbed
in
dealing
with
material
that
they
appear
to
be
untouched
by
the
general
questions
of
life
but
these
general
questions
are
the
habitual
concern
of
the
men
who
think
in
such
men
the
mind
released
from
specific
tasks
turns
at
once
and
by
preference
to
these
great
themes
and
by
quiet
meditation
feeds
and
enriches
the
very
soul
of
the
thinker
and
the
quality
of
this
meditation
determines
whether
the
nature
shall
be
productive
or
sterile
whether
a
man
shall
be
merely
a
logician
or
a
creative
force
in
the
world
following
this
hint
this
lover
of
books
persistently
trained
himself
in
his
leisure
hours
to
think
over
the
books
he
was
reading
to
meditate
on
particular
passages
and
in
the
case
of
dramas
and
novels
to
look
at
characters
from
different
sides
it
was
not
easy
at
first
and
it
was
distinctively
work
but
it
became
instinctive
at
last
and
consequently
it
became
play
the
stream
of
thought
once
set
in
a
given
direction
flows
now
of
its
own
gravitation
and
reverie
instead
of
being
idle
and
meaningless
has
become
rich
and
fruitful
if
one
subjects
the
tempest
for
instance
to
this
process
he
soon
learns
it
by
heart
first
he
feels
its
beauty
then
he
gets
whatever
definite
information
there
is
in
it
as
he
reflects
its
constructive
unity
grows
clear
to
him
and
he
sees
its
quality
as
a
piece
of
art
and
finally
its
rich
and
noble
disclosure
of
the
poet
conception
of
life
grows
upon
him
until
the
play
belongs
to
him
almost
as
much
as
it
belonged
to
shakespeare
this
process
of
meditation
habitually
brought
to
bear
on
one
reading
lays
bare
the
very
heart
of
the
book
in
hand
and
puts
one
in
complete
possession
of
it
this
process
of
meditation
if
it
is
to
bear
its
richest
fruit
must
be
accompanied
by
a
constant
play
of
the
imagination
than
which
there
is
no
faculty
more
readily
cultivated
or
more
constantly
neglected
some
readers
see
only
a
flat
surface
as
they
read
others
find
the
book
a
door
into
a
real
world
and
forget
that
they
are
dealing
with
a
book
the
real
readers
get
beyond
the
book
into
the
life
which
it
describes
they
see
the
island
in
the
tempest
they
hear
the
tumult
of
the
storm
they
mingle
with
the
little
company
who
on
that
magical
stage
reflect
all
the
passions
of
men
and
are
brought
under
the
spell
of
the
highest
powers
of
man
spirit
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
in
the
lives
of
men
of
genius
the
reading
of
two
or
three
books
has
often
provoked
an
immediate
and
striking
expansion
of
thought
and
power

great
definiteness
benjamin
franklin
tells
us
in
that
autobiography
which
was
one
of
our
earliest
and
remains
one
of
our
most
genuine
pieces
of
writing
that
when
he
discovered
his
need
of
a
larger
vocabulary
he
took
some
of
the
tales
which
he
found
in
an
odd
volume
of
the
spectator
and
turned
them
into
verse
and
after
a
time
when
i
had
pretty
well
forgotten
the
prose
turned
them
back
again
i
also
sometimes
jumbled
my
collections
of
hints
into
confusion
and
after
some
weeks
endeavoured
to
reduce
them
into
the
best
order
before
i
began
to
form
the
full
sentences
and
compleat
the
paper
such
a
patient
recasting
of
material
for
the
ends
of
verbal
exactness
and
accuracy
suggests
ways
in
which
the
imagination
may
deal
with
characters
and
scenes
in
order
to
stimulate
and
foster
its
own
activity
it
is
well
to
recall
at
frequent
intervals
the
story
we
read
in
some
dramatist
poet
or
novelist
in
order
that
the
imagination
may
set
it
before
us
again
in
all
its
rich
vitality
it
is
well
also
as
we
read
to
insist
on
seeing
the
picture
as
well
as
the
words
it
is
as
easy
to
see
the
bloodless
duke
before
the
portrait
of
my
last
duchess
in
browning
little
masterpiece
to
take
in
all
the
accessories
and
carry
away
with
us
a
vivid
and
lasting
impression
as
it
is
to
follow
with
the
eye
the
succession
of
words
in
this
way
we
possess
the
poem
and
make
it
serve
the
ends
of
culture
chapter
iv
the
first
delight
we
were
reading
plato
apology
in
the
sixth
form
says
symonds
in
his
account
of
his
school
life
at
harrow
i
bought
cary
crib
and
took
it
with
me
to
london
on
an
in
march
my
hostess
a
bain
who
lived
in
regent
park
treated
me
to
a
comedy
one
evening
at
the
haymarket
i
forget
what
the
play
was
when
we
returned
from
the
play
i
went
to
bed
and
began
to
read
my
cary
plato
it
so
happened
that
i
stumbled
on
the
i
read
on
and
on
till
i
reached
the
end
then
i
began
the
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
shrubs
outside
the
ground
floor
on
which
i
slept
before
i
shut
the
book
up
i
have
related
these
unimportant
details
because
that
night
was
one
of
the
most
important
nights
of
my
life
here
in
the
and
the
in
the
of
the
soul
i
discovered
the
revelation
i
had
been
waiting
for
the
consecration
of
a
idealism
it
was
just
as
though
the
voice
of
my
own
soul
spoke
to
me
through
plato
harrow
vanished
into
unreality
i
had
touched
solid
ground
here
was
the
poetry
the
philosophy
of
my
own
enthusiasm
expressed
with
all
the
magic
of
unrivalled
style
the
experience
recorded
in
these
words
is
typical
it
comes
to
every
one
who
has
the
capacity
for
the
highest
form
of
enjoyment
and
the
highest
kind
of
growth
it
was
an
experience
which
was
both
emotional
and
spiritual
delight
and
expansion
were
involved
in
it
the
joy
of
contact
with
something
beautiful
and
the
sudden
enlargement
which
comes
from
touch
with
a
great
nature
dealing
with
fundamental
truth
in
every
experience
of
this
kind
there
comes
an
access
of
life
as
if
one
had
drunk
at
a
fountain
of
vitality
a
thrilling
chapter
in
the
spiritual
history
of
the
race
might
be
written
by
bringing
together
the
reports
of
such
experiences
which
are
to
be
found
in
almost
all
literatures
experiences
which
vary
greatly
in
depth
and
significance
which
have
in
common
the
unfailing
interest
of
discovery
and
growth
if
this
collocation
of
vital
contacts
could
be
expanded
so
as
to
include
the
history
of
the
intellectual
commerce
of
races
we
should
be
able
to
read
the
story
of
humanity
in
a
new
and
searching
light
for
the
transmission
of
greek
thought
and
beauty
to
the
oriental
world
the
wide
diffusion
of
hebrew
ideas
of
man
and
his
life
the
contact
of
the
modern
with
the
antique
world
in
the
renaissance
for
instance
effected
changes
in
the
spiritual
constitution
of
man
more
subtle
pervasive
and
radical
than
we
are
yet
in
a
position
to
understand
the
spiritual
history
of
men
is
largely
a
history
of
discovery
the
record
of
those
fruitful
moments
when
we
come
upon
new
things
and
our
ideas
are
swiftly
or
slowly
expanded
to
include
them
that
process
is
generally
both
rapid
and
continuous
the
discovery
of
this
continent
made
an
instant
and
striking
impression
on
the
older
world
but
that
older
world
has
not
yet
entirely
adjusted
itself
to
the
changes
in
the
social
order
which
were
to
follow
close
upon
the
rising
of
the
new
world
above
the
once
mysterious
line
of
the
western
horizon
now
this
process
of
discovery
goes
on
continuously
in
the
experience
of
every
human
soul
which
has
capacity
for
growth
and
it
is
the
peculiar
joy
of
the
lover
of
books
literature
is
a
continual
revelation
to
every
genuine
reader
a
revelation
of
that
quality
which
we
call
art
and
a
revelation
of
that
mysterious
vital
force
which
we
call
life
in
this
double
disclosure
literature
shares
with
all
art
a
function
which
ranges
it
with
the
greatest
resources
of
the
spirit
and
the
reader
who
has
the
trained
vision
has
the
constant
joy
of
discovery
first
of
beauty
and
power
next
of
that
concrete
or
vital
form
of
truth
which
is
one
with
life
one
who
studies
books
is
in
constant
peril
of
losing
the
charm
of
the
first
by
permitting
himself
to
be
absorbed
in
the
interest
of
the
second
discovery
when
one
has
begun
to
see
the
range
and
veracity
of
literature
as
a
disclosure
of
the
soul
and
life
of
man
the
definite
literary
quality
sometimes
becomes
of
secondary
importance
in
academic
teaching
the
study
of
philology
of
grammar
of
construction
of
literary
history
has
often
been
mistaken
or
substituted
for
the
study
of
literature
and
in
private
study
the
peculiar
enrichment
which
comes
from
art
simply
as
art
is
often
needlessly
sacrificed
by
exclusive
attention
to
books
as
documents
of
spiritual
history
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
books
become
literature
by
virtue
of
a
certain
quality
which
is
diffused
through
every
true
literary
work
and
which
separates
it
at
once
and
forever
from
all
other
writing
to
miss
this
quality
therefore
is
to
miss
the
very
essence
of
the
thing
with
which
we
are
in
contact
to
treat
the
inspired
books
as
if
they
were
uninspired
the
first
discovery
which
the
real
reader
makes
is
the
perception
of
some
new
and
individual
beauty
or
power
the
discovery
of
life
and
truth
is
secondary
in
order
of
time
and
depends
in
no
small
measure
on
the
sensitiveness
of
the
spirit
to
the
first
and
obvious
charm
if
one
wishes
to
study
the
life
not
the
mere
structure
of
an
in
bloom
he
must
surrender
himself
at
the
start
to
the
bloom
and
fragrance
for
these
are
not
mere
external
phases
of
the
growth
of
the
tree
they
are
most
delicate
and
characteristic
disclosures
of
its
life
in
like
manner
he
who
would
master
as
you
like
it
must
give
himself
up
in
the
first
place
to
its
wonderful
and
significant
beauty
for
this
lovely
piece
of
literature
is
a
revelation
in
its
art
quite
as
definitely
as
in
its
thought
and
the
first
care
of
the
reader
must
be
to
feel
the
deep
and
lasting
charm
contained
in
the
play
in
that
charm
resides
something
which
may
be
transmitted
and
the
reception
of
which
is
always
a
step
in
culture
to
feel
freshly
and
deeply
is
not
only
a
characteristic
of
the
artist
but
also
of
the
reader
the
first
finds
delight
in
creation
the
second
finds
delight
in
discovery
between
them
they
divide
one
of
the
greatest
joys
known
to
men
wagner
somewhere
says
that
the
greatest
joy
possible
to
man
is
the
putting
forth
of
creative
activity
so
spontaneously
that
the
critical
faculty
is
for
the
time
being
asleep
the
purest
joy
known
to
the
reader
is
a
perception
of
the
beauty
and
power
of
a
work
of
art
so
fresh
and
instantaneous
that
it
completely
absorbs
the
whole
nature
analysis
criticism
and
judicial
appraisement
come
later
the
first
moment
must
be
surrendered
to
the
joy
of
discovery
heine
has
recorded
the
overpowering
impression
made
upon
him
by
the
first
glimpse
of
the
venus
of
melos
an
experience
so
extreme
in
emotional
quality
could
come
only
to
a
nature
singularly
sensitive
to
beauty
and
abnormally
sensitive
to
physical
emotion
but
he
who
has
no
power
of
feeling
intensely
the
power
of
beauty
in
the
moment
of
discovery
has
missed
something
of
very
high
value
in
the
process
of
culture
one
of
the
signs
of
real
culture
is
the
power
of
enjoyment
which
goes
with
fresh
feeling
all
great
art
is
full
of
this
feeling
its
characteristic
is
the
new
interest
with
which
it
invests
the
most
familiar
objects
and
one
evidence
of
capacity
to
receive
culture
from
art
is
the
development
of
this
feeling
the
reader
who
is
on
the
way
to
enrich
himself
by
contact
with
books
cultivates
the
power
of
feeling
freshly
and
keenly
the
charm
of
every
book
he
reads
simply
as
a
piece
of
literature
one
may
destroy
this
power
by
permitting
analysis
and
criticism
to
become
the
primary
mood
or
one
may
develop
it
by
resolutely
putting
analysis
and
criticism
into
the
secondary
place
and
sedulously
developing
the
power
to
enjoy
for
the
sake
of
enjoyment
the
reader
who
does
not
feel
the
immediate
and
obvious
beauty
of
a
poem
or
a
play
has
lost
the
power
not
only
of
getting
the
full
effect
of
a
work
of
art
but
of
getting
its
full
significance
as
well
the
surprise
the
delight
the
joy
of
the
first
discovery
are
not
merely
pleasurable
they
are
in
the
highest
degree
educational
they
reveal
the
sensitiveness
of
the
nature
to
those
ultimate
forms
of
beauty
and
power
which
art
takes
on
and
its
power
of
responding
not
only
to
what
is
obviously
beautiful
but
is
also
profoundly
true
for
the
harmonious
and
noble
beauty
of
as
you
like
it
is
not
only
obvious
and
external
it
is
wrought
into
its
structure
so
completely
that
like
the
blossom
of
the
apple
it
is
the
effluence
of
the
life
of
the
play
to
get
delight
out
of
reading
is
therefore
the
first
and
constant
care
of
the
reader
who
wishes
to
be
enriched
by
vital
contact
with
the
most
inclusive
and
expressive
of
the
arts
chapter
the
feeling
for
literature
the
importance
of
reading
habitually
the
best
books
becomes
apparent
when
one
remembers
that
taste
depends
very
largely
on
the
standards
with
which
we
are
familiar
and
that
the
ability
to
enjoy
the
best
and
only
the
best
is
conditioned
upon
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
best
the
man
who
is
thrown
into
constant
association
with
inferior
work
either
revolts
against
his
surroundings
or
suffers
a
disintegration
of
aim
and
standard
which
perceptibly
lowers
the
plane
on
which
he
lives
in
either
case
the
power
of
enjoyment
from
contact
with
a
genuine
piece
of
creative
work
is
sensibly
diminished
and
may
be
finally
lost
the
delicacy
of
the
mind
is
both
precious
and
perishable
it
can
be
preserved
only
by
associations
which
confirm
and
satisfy
it
for
this
reason
among
others
the
best
books
are
the
only
books
which
a
man
bent
on
culture
should
read
inferior
books
not
only
waste
his
time
but
they
dull
the
edge
of
his
perception
and
diminish
his
capacity
for
delight
this
delight
born
afresh
of
every
new
contact
of
the
mind
with
a
real
book
furnishes
indubitable
evidence
that
the
reader
has
the
feeling
for
literature
a
possession
much
rarer
than
is
commonly
supposed
it
is
no
injustice
to
say
that
the
majority
of
those
who
read
have
no
feeling
for
literature
their
interest
is
awakened
or
sustained
not
by
the
literary
quality
of
a
book
but
by
some
element
of
brightness
or
novelty
or
by
the
charm
of
narrative
reading
which
finds
its
reward
in
these
things
is
entirely
legitimate
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
reading
which
secures
culture
it
adds
largely
to
one
stock
of
information
and
it
refreshes
the
mind
by
introducing
new
objects
of
interest
but
it
does
not
minister
directly
to
the
refining
and
maturing
of
the
nature
the
same
book
may
be
read
in
entirely
different
ways
and
with
entirely
different
results
one
may
for
instance
read
shakespeare
historical
plays
simply
for
the
story
element
which
runs
through
them
and
for
the
interest
which
the
skilful
use
of
that
element
excites
and
in
such
a
reading
there
will
be
distinct
gain
for
the
reader
this
is
the
way
in
which
a
healthy
boy
generally
reads
these
plays
for
the
first
time
from
such
a
reading
one
will
get
information
and
refreshment
more
than
one
english
statesman
has
confessed
that
he
owed
his
knowledge
of
certain
periods
of
english
history
largely
to
shakespeare
on
the
other
hand
one
may
read
these
plays
for
the
joy
of
the
art
that
is
in
them
and
for
the
enrichment
which
comes
from
contact
with
the
deep
and
tumultuous
life
which
throbs
through
them
and
this
is
the
kind
of
reading
which
produces
culture
the
reading
which
means
enlargement
and
ripening
the
feeling
for
literature
like
the
feeling
for
art
in
general
is
not
only
susceptible
of
cultivation
but
very
quickly
responds
to
appeals
which
are
made
to
it
by
noble
or
beautiful
objects
it
is
essentially
a
feeling
but
it
is
a
feeling
which
depends
very
largely
on
intelligence
it
is
strengthened
and
made
sensitive
and
responsive
by
constant
contact
with
those
objects
which
call
it
out
no
rules
can
be
laid
down
for
its
development
save
the
very
simple
rule
to
read
only
and
always
those
books
which
are
literature
it
is
impossible
to
give
specific
directions
for
the
cultivation
of
the
feeling
for
nature
it
is
not
to
be
gotten
out
of
of
any
kind
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
botanies
or
geologies
or
works
on
zoölogy
it
is
to
be
gotten
only
out
of
familiarity
with
nature
herself
daily
fellowship
with
landscapes
trees
skies
birds
with
an
open
mind
and
in
a
receptive
mood
soon
develops
in
one
a
kind
of
spiritual
sense
which
takes
cognisance
of
things
not
seen
before
and
adds
a
new
joy
and
resource
to
life
in
like
manner
the
feeling
for
literature
is
quickened
and
nourished
by
intimate
acquaintance
with
books
of
beauty
and
power
such
an
intimacy
makes
the
sense
of
delight
more
keen
preserves
it
against
influences
which
tend
to
deaden
it
and
makes
the
taste
more
sure
and
trustworthy
a
man
who
has
long
had
acquaintance
with
the
best
in
any
department
of
art
comes
to
have
almost
unconsciously
to
himself
an
instinctive
power
of
discerning
good
work
from
bad
of
recognising
on
the
instant
the
sound
and
true
method
and
style
and
of
feeling
a
fresh
and
constant
delight
in
such
work
his
education
comes
not
by
didactic
but
by
vital
methods
the
art
quality
in
a
book
is
as
difficult
to
analyse
as
the
feeling
for
it
not
because
it
is
intangible
or
indefinite
but
because
it
is
so
subtly
diffused
it
is
difficult
to
analyse
because
it
is
the
breath
of
life
in
the
book
and
life
always
evades
us
no
matter
how
keen
and
exhaustive
our
search
may
be
most
of
us
are
so
entirely
out
of
touch
with
the
spirit
of
art
in
this
busy
new
world
that
we
are
not
quite
convinced
of
its
reality
we
know
that
it
is
decorative
and
that
a
certain
pleasure
flows
from
it
but
we
are
sceptical
of
its
significance
in
the
life
of
the
race
of
its
deep
necessity
in
the
development
of
that
life
and
of
its
supreme
educational
value
and
our
scepticism
it
must
be
frankly
said
like
most
scepticism
grows
out
of
our
ignorance
true
art
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
popular
conception
of
its
nature
and
uses
instead
of
being
decorative
it
is
organic
when
men
arrive
at
a
certain
stage
of
ripeness
and
power
they
express
themselves
through
its
forms
as
naturally
as
the
tree
puts
forth
its
flowers
nothing
which
lies
within
the
range
of
human
achievement
is
more
real
or
inevitable
this
expression
is
neither
mechanical
nor
artificial
it
is
made
under
certain
inflexible
laws
but
they
are
the
laws
of
the
human
spirit
not
the
rules
of
a
craft
they
are
rooted
in
that
deeper
psychology
which
deals
with
man
as
an
organic
whole
and
not
as
a
bundle
of
separate
faculties
it
was
once
pointed
out
to
tennyson
that
he
had
scrupulously
conformed
in
a
certain
poem
to
a
number
of
rules
of
versification
and
to
certain
principles
in
the
use
of
different
sound
values
yes
answered
the
poet
in
substance
i
carefully
observed
all
those
rules
and
was
entirely
unconscious
of
them
there
was
no
contradiction
between
the
laureate
practice
of
his
craft
and
the
technical
rules
which
govern
it
the
poet
instinct
kept
him
in
harmony
with
those
essential
and
vital
principles
of
language
of
which
the
formal
rules
are
simply
didactic
statements
art
it
need
hardly
be
said
is
never
artifice
intelligence
and
calculation
enter
into
the
work
of
the
artist
but
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
the
free
and
noble
expression
of
his
own
personality
it
expresses
what
is
deepest
and
most
significant
in
him
and
expresses
it
in
a
final
rather
than
a
provisional
form
the
secret
of
the
reality
and
power
of
art
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
culmination
and
summing
up
of
a
process
of
observation
experience
and
feeling
it
is
the
deposit
of
whatever
is
richest
and
most
enduring
in
the
life
of
a
man
or
a
race
it
is
a
finality
both
of
experience
and
of
thought
it
contains
the
ultimate
and
the
widest
conception
of
man
nature
and
life
or
of
the
meaning
and
reality
of
nature
which
an
age
or
a
race
reaches
it
is
the
supreme
flowering
of
the
genius
of
a
race
or
an
age
it
has
therefore
the
highest
educational
value
for
the
very
highest
products
of
man
life
in
this
world
are
his
ideas
and
ideals
they
grow
out
of
his
highest
nature
they
react
on
his
character
they
are
the
precious
deposit
of
all
that
he
has
thought
felt
suffered
and
done
in
word
and
work
in
feeling
and
action
the
richest
educational
material
upon
which
modern
men
are
nourished
are
these
ultimate
conclusions
and
convictions
of
the
hebrew
the
greek
and
the
roman
these
ultimate
inferences
these
final
interpretations
of
their
own
natures
and
of
the
world
about
them
contain
not
only
the
thought
of
these
races
but
their
life
as
well
they
have
therefore
a
vital
quality
which
not
only
assures
their
own
immortality
but
has
the
power
of
transmission
to
others
these
ultimate
results
of
experience
are
embodied
in
art
and
especially
in
literature
and
that
which
makes
them
art
is
this
very
vitality
for
this
reason
art
is
absolutely
essential
for
culture
it
has
the
power
of
enriching
and
expanding
the
natures
which
come
in
contact
with
it
by
transmitting
to
them
the
highest
results
of
the
life
of
the
past
by
sharing
with
them
the
ripeness
and
maturity
of
the
human
spirit
in
its
universal
experience
chapter
vi
the
books
of
life
the
books
of
power
as
distinguished
from
the
books
of
knowledge
include
the
original
creative
books
in
all
literatures
and
constitute
in
the
last
analysis
a
comparatively
small
group
with
which
any
student
can
thoroughly
familiarise
himself
the
literary
impulse
of
the
race
has
expressed
itself
in
a
great
variety
of
works
of
varying
charm
and
power
but
the
books
which
are
of
vitality
ideas
and
beauty
are
few
in
number
these
original
and
dominant
creations
may
be
called
the
books
of
life
if
one
may
venture
to
modify
de
quincey
phrase
for
that
which
is
deepest
in
this
group
of
masterpieces
is
not
power
but
something
greater
and
more
inclusive
of
which
power
is
but
a
single
form
of
expression
life
that
quintessence
of
the
unbroken
experience
and
activity
of
the
race
which
includes
not
only
thought
power
beauty
and
every
kind
of
skill
but
below
all
these
the
living
soul
of
the
living
man
if
it
be
true
as
many
believe
that
the
fundamental
process
of
the
universe
so
far
as
we
can
understand
it
is
not
intellectual
but
vital
it
follows
that
the
deepest
things
which
men
have
learned
have
come
to
them
not
as
the
result
of
processes
of
thought
but
as
the
result
of
the
process
of
living
it
is
evident
that
certain
definite
purposes
are
being
wrought
out
through
physical
forms
processes
and
forces
science
reveals
clearly
enough
certain
great
lines
of
development
in
like
manner
although
with
very
significant
differences
certain
deep
lines
of
growth
and
expansion
become
more
and
more
clear
in
human
history
through
the
bare
process
of
living
men
not
only
learn
fundamental
facts
about
themselves
and
their
world
but
they
are
evidently
working
out
certain
purposes
of
these
purposes
they
do
not
it
is
true
possess
full
knowledge
but
complete
knowledge
is
necessary
neither
for
the
demonstration
of
the
existence
of
the
purpose
nor
for
those
ethical
and
intellectual
uses
which
that
knowledge
serves
the
life
of
the
race
is
a
revelation
of
the
nature
of
man
of
the
character
of
his
relations
with
his
surroundings
and
of
the
certain
great
lines
of
development
along
which
the
race
is
moving
every
leading
race
has
its
characteristic
thought
concerning
its
own
nature
its
relation
to
the
world
and
the
character
and
quality
of
life
these
various
fundamental
conceptions
have
shaped
all
definite
thinking
and
have
very
largely
moulded
race
character
and
therefore
determined
race
destiny
the
hebrew
the
greek
and
the
roman
conceptions
of
life
constitute
not
only
the
key
to
the
diverse
histories
of
the
leaders
of
ancient
civilisation
but
also
their
most
vital
contribution
to
civilisation
these
conceptions
were
not
definitely
thought
out
they
were
worked
out
they
were
the
result
of
the
contact
of
these
different
peoples
with
nature
with
the
circumstances
of
their
own
time
and
with
those
universal
experiences
which
fall
to
the
lot
of
all
men
and
which
are
in
the
long
run
the
prime
sources
and
instruments
of
human
education
the
interpretations
of
life
which
each
of
these
races
has
left
us
are
revelations
both
of
race
character
and
of
life
itself
they
embody
the
highest
thought
the
deepest
feeling
the
most
searching
experiences
the
keenest
suffering
the
most
strenuous
activity
in
these
interpretations
are
expressed
and
represented
the
inner
and
essential
life
of
each
race
in
them
the
soul
of
the
elder
world
survives
now
these
interpretations
constitute
in
their
highest
forms
not
only
the
supreme
art
of
the
world
but
they
are
also
the
richest
educational
material
accessible
to
men
information
and
discipline
may
be
drawn
from
other
sources
but
that
culture
which
means
the
enrichment
and
unfolding
of
a
man
self
is
largely
developed
by
familiarity
with
those
ultimate
conclusions
of
man
about
himself
which
are
the
deposit
of
all
that
he
has
thought
suffered
wrought
and
been
those
deep
deposits
of
truth
silently
formed
in
the
heart
of
the
race
in
the
long
and
painful
working
out
of
its
life
its
character
and
its
destiny
for
these
rich
interpretations
we
must
turn
to
art
and
especially
to
the
art
of
literature
and
in
literature
we
must
turn
especially
to
the
small
group
of
works
which
by
reason
of
the
adequacy
with
which
they
convey
and
illustrate
these
interpretations
hold
the
first
places
the
books
of
life
the
man
who
would
get
the
ripest
culture
from
books
ought
to
read
many
but
there
are
a
few
books
which
he
must
read
among
them
first
and
foremost
are
the
bible
and
the
works
of
homer
dante
shakespeare
and
goethe
these
are
the
supreme
books
of
life
as
distinguished
from
the
books
of
knowledge
and
skill
they
hold
their
places
because
they
combine
in
the
highest
degree
vitality
truth
power
and
beauty
they
are
the
central
reservoirs
into
which
the
rivulets
of
individual
experience
over
a
vast
surface
have
been
gathered
they
are
the
most
complete
revelations
of
what
life
has
brought
and
has
been
to
the
leading
races
they
bring
us
into
contact
with
the
heart
and
soul
of
humanity
they
not
only
convey
information
and
rightly
used
impart
discipline
but
they
transmit
life
there
is
a
vitality
in
them
which
passes
on
into
the
nature
which
is
open
to
receive
it
they
have
again
and
again
inspired
intellectual
movements
on
a
wide
scale
as
they
are
constantly
recreating
individual
ideals
and
aims
whatever
view
may
be
held
of
the
authority
of
the
bible
it
is
agreed
that
its
power
as
literature
has
been
incalculable
by
reason
of
the
depth
of
life
which
it
sounds
and
the
range
of
life
which
it
compasses
there
is
power
enough
in
it
to
revive
a
decaying
age
or
give
a
new
date
and
a
fresh
impulse
to
a
race
which
has
parted
with
its
creative
energy
the
reappearance
of
the
new
testament
in
greek
after
the
long
reign
of
the
vulgate
contributed
mightily
to
that
renewal
and
revival
of
life
which
we
call
the
reformation
while
its
translation
into
the
modern
languages
liberated
a
moral
and
intellectual
force
of
which
no
adequate
measurement
can
be
made
in
like
manner
though
in
lesser
degree
the
iliad
and
odyssey
the
divine
comedy
the
plays
of
shakespeare
and
faust
have
set
new
movements
in
motion
and
have
enriched
and
enlarged
the
lives
of
races
with
these
books
of
life
every
man
ought
to
hold
the
most
intimate
relationship
they
are
not
to
be
read
once
and
put
on
the
upper
shelves
of
the
library
among
those
classics
which
establish
claim
to
good
intellectual
standing
but
which
silently
gather
the
dust
of
isolation
and
solitude
they
are
to
be
always
at
hand
the
barrier
of
language
has
disappeared
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
they
are
to
be
had
in
many
and
admirable
translations
one
evidence
of
their
power
is
afforded
by
the
fact
that
every
new
age
of
literary
development
and
every
new
literary
movement
feels
compelled
to
translate
them
afresh
the
changes
of
taste
in
english
literature
and
the
notable
phases
through
which
it
has
passed
since
the
days
of
the
elizabethans
might
be
traced
or
inferred
from
the
successive
translations
of
homer
from
the
work
of
chapman
to
that
of
andrew
lang
one
needs
to
read
many
books
to
browse
in
many
fields
to
know
the
art
of
many
countries
but
the
books
of
life
ought
to
form
the
background
of
every
life
of
thought
and
study
they
need
not
indeed
they
can
not
be
mastered
at
once
but
by
reading
in
them
constantly
for
brief
or
for
long
intervals
one
comes
to
know
them
familiarly
and
almost
insensibly
to
gain
the
enrichment
and
enlargement
which
they
offer
moreover
they
afford
tenfold
greater
and
more
lasting
delight
recreation
and
variety
than
all
the
works
of
lesser
writers
whoever
knows
them
in
a
real
sense
knows
life
humanity
art
and
himself
chapter
vii
from
the
book
to
the
reader
the
study
which
has
found
its
material
and
its
reward
in
divine
comedy
or
in
goethe
faust
is
the
best
possible
evidence
of
the
inexhaustible
interest
in
the
masterpieces
of
these
two
great
poets
libraries
of
considerable
dimensions
have
been
written
in
the
way
of
commentaries
upon
and
expositions
of
their
notable
works
many
of
these
books
are
it
is
true
deficient
in
insight
and
possessed
of
very
little
power
of
interpretation
or
illumination
they
are
the
products
of
a
barren
industry
which
has
expended
itself
upon
external
characteristics
and
incidental
references
nevertheless
the
very
volume
and
mass
of
these
secondary
books
witness
to
the
fertility
of
the
books
with
which
they
deal
and
show
beyond
dispute
that
men
have
an
insatiable
desire
to
get
at
their
interior
meanings
if
these
great
poems
had
been
mere
illustrations
of
individual
skill
and
gift
this
interest
would
have
long
ago
exhausted
itself
that
singular
and
unsurpassed
qualities
of
construction
style
and
diction
are
present
in
faust
and
the
divine
comedy
need
not
be
emphasised
since
they
both
belong
to
the
very
highest
class
of
literary
production
but
there
is
something
deeper
and
more
vital
in
them
there
is
a
philosophy
or
interpretation
of
life
each
of
these
poems
is
a
revelation
of
what
man
is
and
of
what
his
life
means
and
it
is
this
deep
truth
or
set
of
truths
at
the
heart
of
these
works
which
we
are
always
striving
to
reach
and
make
clear
to
ourselves
in
the
case
of
neither
poem
did
the
writer
content
himself
with
an
exposition
of
his
own
experience
in
both
cases
there
is
an
attempt
to
embody
and
put
in
concrete
form
an
immense
section
of
universal
experience
neither
poem
could
have
been
written
if
there
had
not
been
a
long
antecedent
history
rich
in
every
kind
and
quality
of
human
contact
with
the
world
and
of
the
working
out
of
the
forces
which
are
in
every
human
soul
these
two
forms
of
activity
represent
in
a
general
way
what
men
have
learned
about
themselves
and
their
surroundings
and
taken
together
they
constitute
the
material
out
of
which
interpretations
and
explanations
of
human
life
have
been
made
these
explanations
vary
according
to
the
genius
the
environment
and
the
history
of
races
but
in
every
case
they
represent
the
very
soul
of
race
life
for
they
are
the
spiritual
forms
in
which
that
life
has
expressed
itself
other
forms
of
race
activity
however
valuable
or
beautiful
are
lost
in
the
passage
of
time
or
are
taken
up
and
absorbed
and
so
part
with
their
separate
and
individual
existence
but
the
quintessence
of
experience
and
thought
expressed
in
great
works
of
art
is
gathered
up
and
preserved
as
milton
said
for
a
life
beyond
life
now
it
is
upon
this
imperishable
food
which
the
past
has
stored
up
through
the
genius
of
great
artists
that
later
generations
feed
and
nourish
themselves
it
is
through
intimate
contact
with
these
fundamental
conceptions
worked
out
with
such
infinite
pain
and
patience
that
the
individual
experience
is
broadened
to
include
the
experience
of
the
race
this
contact
is
the
mystery
as
it
is
the
source
of
culture
no
one
can
explain
the
transmission
of
power
from
a
book
to
a
reader
but
all
history
bears
witness
to
the
fact
that
such
transmissions
are
made
sometimes
as
during
what
is
called
the
revival
of
learning
the
transmission
is
so
general
and
so
genuine
that
the
life
of
an
entire
society
is
visibly
quickened
and
enlarged
indeed
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
an
entire
civilisation
feels
the
effect
the
transmission
of
power
the
transference
of
vitality
from
books
to
individuals
are
so
constant
and
common
that
they
are
matters
of
universal
experience
most
men
of
any
considerable
culture
date
the
successive
enlargements
of
their
intellectual
lives
from
the
reading
at
successive
periods
of
the
books
of
insight
and
power
the
books
that
deal
with
life
at
firsthand
there
are
for
instance
few
men
of
a
certain
age
who
have
read
widely
or
deeply
who
do
not
recall
with
perennial
enthusiasm
the
days
when
carlyle
and
emerson
fell
into
their
hands
they
may
have
reacted
radically
from
the
didactic
teaching
of
both
writers
but
they
have
not
lost
the
impulse
nor
have
they
parted
with
the
enlargement
of
thought
received
in
those
first
rapturous
hours
of
discovery
there
was
wrought
in
them
then
changes
of
view
expansions
of
nature
a
liberation
of
life
which
can
never
be
lost
this
experience
is
repeated
so
long
as
the
man
retains
the
power
of
growth
and
so
long
as
he
keeps
in
contact
with
the
great
writers
every
such
contact
marks
a
new
stage
in
the
process
of
culture
this
means
not
merely
the
deep
satisfaction
and
delight
which
are
involved
in
every
fresh
contact
with
a
genuine
work
of
art
it
means
the
permanent
enrichment
of
the
reader
he
has
gained
something
more
lasting
than
pleasure
and
more
valuable
than
information
he
has
gained
a
new
view
of
life
he
has
looked
again
into
the
heart
of
humanity
he
has
felt
afresh
the
supreme
interest
which
always
attaches
to
any
real
contact
with
the
life
of
the
race
and
all
this
comes
to
him
not
only
because
the
life
of
the
race
is
essentially
dramatic
and
therefore
of
quite
inexhaustible
interest
but
because
that
life
is
essentially
a
revelation
a
series
of
fundamental
truths
is
being
disclosed
through
the
simple
process
of
living
and
whoever
touches
the
deep
life
of
men
in
the
great
works
of
art
comes
in
contact
also
with
these
fundamental
truths
whoever
reads
the
divine
comedy
and
faust
for
the
first
time
discovers
new
realms
of
truth
for
himself
and
gains
not
only
the
joy
of
discovery
but
an
immense
addition
of
territory
as
well
the
most
careless
and
superficial
readers
do
not
remain
untouched
by
the
books
of
life
they
fail
to
understand
them
or
get
the
most
out
of
them
but
they
do
not
escape
the
spell
which
they
all
possess
the
power
of
compelling
the
attention
and
stirring
the
heart
not
many
years
ago
the
stories
of
the
russian
novelists
were
in
all
hands
that
the
fashion
has
passed
is
evident
enough
and
it
is
also
evident
that
the
craving
for
these
books
was
largely
a
fashion
nevertheless
the
fashion
itself
was
due
to
the
real
power
which
those
stories
revealed
and
which
constitutes
their
lasting
contribution
to
the
literature
they
were
touched
with
a
profound
sadness
which
was
exhaled
like
a
mist
by
the
conditions
they
portrayed
they
were
full
of
a
sympathy
born
of
knowledge
and
of
sorrow
their
roots
were
in
the
rich
soil
of
the
life
they
described
the
latest
of
them
count
tolstoi
master
and
man
is
one
of
those
masterpieces
which
take
rank
at
once
not
by
reason
of
their
magnitude
but
by
reason
of
a
certain
beautiful
quality
which
comes
only
to
the
man
whose
heart
is
pressed
against
the
heart
of
his
theme
and
who
divines
what
life
is
in
the
inarticulate
soul
of
his
brother
man
such
books
are
the
rich
material
of
culture
to
the
man
who
reads
them
with
his
heart
because
they
add
to
his
experience
a
kind
of
experience
otherwise
inaccessible
to
him
which
quickens
refreshes
and
broadens
his
own
nature
chapter
viii
by
way
of
illustration
the
peculiar
quality
which
culture
imparts
is
beyond
the
comprehension
of
a
child
and
yet
it
is
something
so
definite
and
engaging
that
a
child
may
recognise
its
presence
and
feel
its
attraction
one
of
the
special
pieces
of
good
fortune
which
fell
to
my
boyhood
was
companionship
with
a
man
whose
note
of
distinction
while
not
entirely
clear
to
me
threw
a
spell
over
me
i
knew
other
men
of
greater
force
and
of
larger
scholarship
but
no
one
else
gave
me
such
an
impression
of
balance
ripeness
and
fineness
of
quality
i
not
only
felt
a
peculiarly
searching
influence
flowing
from
one
who
graciously
put
himself
on
my
level
of
intelligence
but
i
felt
also
an
impulse
to
emulate
a
nature
which
satisfied
my
imagination
completely
other
men
of
ability
whose
conversation
i
heard
filled
me
with
admiration
this
man
made
the
world
larger
and
richer
to
my
boyish
thought
there
was
no
didacticism
on
his
part
there
was
on
the
contrary
a
simplicity
so
great
that
i
felt
entirely
at
home
with
him
but
he
was
so
thoroughly
a
citizen
of
the
world
that
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
world
in
his
most
casual
talk
i
got
a
sense
of
the
largeness
and
richness
of
life
from
him
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
which
laid
such
hold
on
my
mind
but
i
saw
later
that
it
was
the
remarkable
culture
of
the
man
a
culture
made
possible
by
many
fortunate
conditions
of
wealth
station
travel
and
education
and
expressing
itself
in
a
peculiar
largeness
of
vision
and
sweetness
of
spirit
in
this
man
friendship
i
was
for
the
moment
lifted
out
of
my
own
crudity
into
that
vast
movement
and
experience
in
which
all
the
races
have
shared
i
am
often
reminded
of
this
early
impulse
and
enthusiasm
but
there
are
occasions
when
its
significance
and
value
become
especially
clear
to
me
it
was
brought
forcibly
to
my
mind
several
years
ago
by
an
hour
or
two
of
talk
with
one
who
as
truly
as
any
other
american
stands
as
a
representative
man
of
culture
one
that
is
whose
large
scholarship
has
been
so
completely
absorbed
that
it
has
enriched
the
very
texture
of
his
mind
and
given
him
the
gift
of
sharing
the
experience
of
the
race
it
was
on
an
evening
when
a
play
of
sophocles
was
to
be
rendered
by
the
students
of
a
certain
university
in
which
the
tradition
of
culture
has
never
wholly
died
out
and
i
led
the
talk
along
the
lines
of
the
play
i
was
rewarded
by
an
hour
of
such
delight
as
comes
only
from
the
best
kind
of
talk
and
i
felt
anew
the
peculiar
charm
and
power
of
culture
for
what
i
got
that
enriched
me
and
prepared
me
for
real
comprehension
of
one
of
the
greatest
works
of
art
in
all
literature
was
not
information
but
atmosphere
i
saw
rising
about
me
the
vanished
life
which
the
dramatist
knew
so
well
that
its
secrets
of
conviction
and
temperament
were
all
open
to
him
in
architecture
poetry
religion
politics
and
manners
it
was
quietly
rebuilded
for
me
in
such
wise
that
my
own
imagination
was
stirred
to
meet
the
talker
and
to
fill
in
the
outlines
of
a
picture
so
swiftly
and
skilfully
sketched
when
i
went
to
the
play
i
went
as
a
contemporary
of
its
writer
might
have
gone
i
did
not
need
to
enter
into
it
for
it
had
already
entered
into
me
a
man
of
scholarship
could
have
set
the
period
before
me
in
a
mass
of
facts
a
man
of
culture
alone
could
give
me
power
to
share
for
an
evening
at
least
its
spirit
and
life
these
personal
illustrations
will
be
pardoned
because
they
bring
out
in
the
most
concrete
way
that
special
quality
which
marks
the
possession
of
culture
in
the
deepest
sense
that
quality
allies
it
very
closely
with
genius
itself
in
certain
aspects
of
that
rare
and
inexplicable
gift
for
one
of
the
most
characteristic
qualities
of
genius
is
its
power
of
divination
of
sharing
alien
or
diverse
experiences
it
is
this
peculiar
insight
which
puts
the
great
dramatists
in
possession
of
the
secrets
of
so
many
temperaments
the
springs
of
so
many
different
personalities
the
atmosphere
of
such
remote
periods
of
time
which
in
a
way
gives
them
power
to
make
the
dead
live
again
for
shakespeare
can
stand
at
the
tomb
of
cleopatra
and
evoke
not
the
shade
but
the
passionate
woman
herself
out
of
the
dust
in
which
she
sleeps
there
has
been
perhaps
no
more
luminous
example
of
the
faculty
of
sharing
the
experience
of
a
past
age
of
entering
into
the
thought
and
feeling
of
a
vanished
race
than
the
peculiar
divination
and
rehabilitation
of
certain
extinct
phases
of
emotion
and
thought
which
one
finds
in
the
pages
of
walter
pater
in
those
pages
there
are
it
is
true
occasional
lapses
from
a
perfectly
sound
method
there
is
at
times
a
loss
of
simplicity
a
cloying
sweetness
in
the
style
of
this
accomplished
writer
these
are
however
the
perils
of
a
very
sensitive
temperament
an
intense
feeling
for
beauty
and
a
certain
seclusion
from
the
affairs
of
life
that
which
characterises
pater
at
all
times
is
his
power
of
putting
himself
amid
conditions
that
are
not
only
extinct
but
obscure
and
elusive
of
winding
himself
back
as
it
were
into
the
primitive
greek
consciousness
and
recovering
for
the
moment
the
world
as
the
greeks
saw
or
rather
felt
it
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
mass
the
facts
about
any
given
period
it
is
a
very
different
and
a
very
difficult
matter
to
set
those
facts
in
vital
relations
to
each
other
to
see
them
in
true
prospective
and
the
difficulties
are
immensely
increased
when
the
period
is
not
only
remote
but
deficient
in
definite
registry
of
thought
and
feeling
when
the
record
of
what
it
believed
and
felt
does
not
exist
by
itself
but
must
be
deciphered
from
those
works
of
art
in
which
is
preserved
the
final
form
of
thought
and
feeling
and
in
which
are
gathered
and
merged
a
great
mass
of
ideas
and
emotions
this
is
especially
true
of
the
more
subtle
and
elusive
greek
myths
which
were
in
no
case
creations
of
the
individual
imagination
or
of
definite
periods
of
time
but
which
were
fed
by
many
tributaries
very
slowly
taking
shape
out
of
general
but
shadowy
impressions
widely
diffused
but
vague
ideas
deeply
felt
but
obscure
emotions
to
get
at
the
heart
of
one
of
these
stories
one
must
be
able
not
only
to
enter
into
the
thought
of
the
unknown
poets
who
made
their
contributions
to
the
myth
but
must
also
be
able
to
disentangle
the
threads
of
idea
and
feeling
so
deftly
woven
together
and
follow
each
back
to
its
shadowy
beginning
to
do
this
one
must
have
not
only
knowledge
but
sympathy
and
imagination
those
closely
related
qualities
which
get
at
the
soul
of
knowledge
and
make
it
live
again
those
qualities
which
the
man
of
culture
shares
in
no
small
measure
with
the
man
of
genius
in
his
studies
of
such
myths
as
those
which
gather
about
dionysus
and
demeter
this
is
precisely
what
pater
did
he
not
only
marked
out
distinctly
the
courses
of
the
main
streams
but
he
followed
back
the
rivulets
to
their
he
not
only
mastered
the
thought
of
an
extinct
people
but
what
is
much
more
difficult
he
put
off
his
knowledge
and
put
on
their
ignorance
he
not
only
entered
into
their
thought
about
the
world
of
nature
which
surrounded
them
but
he
entered
into
their
feeling
about
it
very
lightly
touched
and
charming
is
for
instance
his
description
of
the
habits
and
haunts
and
worship
of
demeter
the
current
impressions
of
her
service
and
place
in
the
life
of
the
world
demeter
haunts
the
fields
in
spring
when
the
young
lambs
are
dropped
she
visits
the
barns
in
autumn
she
takes
part
in
mowing
and
binding
up
the
corn
and
is
the
goddess
of
sheaves
she
presides
over
the
pleasant
significant
details
of
the
farm
the
and
the
full
granary
and
stands
beside
the
woman
baking
bread
at
the
oven
with
these
fancies
are
connected
certain
simple
rites
the
local
observance
and
the
local
legend
reacting
capriciously
on
each
other
they
leave
her
a
fragment
of
bread
and
a
morsel
of
meat
at
the
crossroads
to
take
on
her
journey
and
perhaps
some
real
demeter
carries
them
away
as
she
wanders
through
the
country
the
incidents
of
their
yearly
labour
become
to
them
acts
of
worship
they
seek
her
blessing
through
many
expressive
names
and
almost
catch
sight
of
her
at
dawn
or
evening
in
the
nooks
of
the
fragrant
fields
she
lays
a
finger
on
the
grass
at
the
roadside
and
some
new
flower
comes
up
all
the
picturesque
implements
of
country
life
are
hers
the
poppy
also
emblem
of
an
exhaustless
fertility
and
full
of
mysterious
juices
for
the
alleviation
of
pain
the
who
puts
her
child
to
sleep
in
the
great
basket
for
winnowing
the
corn
remembers
demeter
the
mother
of
corn
and
children
alike
and
makes
it
a
little
coat
out
of
the
dress
worn
by
its
father
at
his
initiation
into
her
mysteries
she
lies
on
the
ground
on
summer
nights
and
becomes
wet
with
the
dew
she
grows
young
again
every
spring
yet
is
of
great
age
the
wrinkled
woman
of
the
homeric
hymn
who
becomes
the
nurse
of
demophoon
this
bit
of
description
moves
with
so
light
a
foot
that
one
forgets
as
true
art
always
makes
one
forget
the
mass
of
hard
and
scattered
materials
which
lie
back
of
it
materials
which
would
not
have
yielded
their
secret
of
unity
and
vitality
save
to
imagination
and
sympathy
to
knowledge
which
has
ripened
into
culture
but
the
recovery
of
such
a
story
the
reconstruction
of
such
a
figure
are
not
affected
by
description
alone
one
must
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
the
myth
and
master
the
significance
of
the
woman
transformed
by
idealisation
into
a
beneficent
and
much
labouring
goddess
we
must
go
with
pater
a
step
farther
if
we
would
understand
how
a
man
of
culture
divines
the
deeper
experiences
of
an
alien
race
three
profound
ethical
conceptions
three
impressive
sacred
figures
have
now
defined
themselves
for
the
greek
imagination
condensed
from
all
the
traditions
which
have
now
been
traced
from
the
hymns
of
the
poets
from
the
instinctive
and
unformulated
mysticism
of
primitive
minds
demeter
is
become
the
divine
sorrowing
mother
kore
the
goddess
of
summer
is
become
persephone
the
goddess
of
death
still
associated
with
the
forms
and
odours
of
flowers
and
fruit
yet
as
one
risen
from
the
dead
also
presenting
one
side
of
her
ambiguous
nature
to
gloomier
fancies
thirdly
there
is
the
image
of
demeter
enthroned
chastened
by
sorrow
and
somewhat
advanced
in
age
blessing
the
earth
in
her
joy
at
the
return
of
kore
the
myth
has
now
entered
upon
the
third
phase
of
its
life
in
which
it
becomes
the
property
of
those
more
elevated
spirits
who
in
the
decline
of
the
greek
religion
pick
and
choose
and
modify
with
perfect
freedom
of
mind
whatever
in
it
may
seem
adapted
to
minister
to
their
culture
in
this
way
the
myths
of
the
greek
religion
become
parts
of
an
ideal
visible
embodiments
of
the
susceptibilities
and
intentions
of
the
nobler
kind
of
souls
and
it
is
to
this
latest
phase
of
mythological
development
that
the
highest
greek
sculpture
allies
itself
this
illustration
of
the
divination
by
which
the
man
of
culture
possesses
himself
of
a
and
obscurely
recorded
experience
and
rehabilitates
and
interprets
it
is
so
complete
that
it
makes
amplification
superfluous
chapter
ix
personality
it
is
undeniable
says
matthew
arnold
that
the
exercise
of
a
creative
power
that
a
free
creative
activity
is
the
highest
function
of
man
it
is
proved
to
be
so
by
man
finding
in
it
his
true
happiness
if
this
be
true
and
the
heart
of
man
apart
from
all
testimony
affirms
it
then
the
great
books
not
only
embody
and
express
the
genius
and
vital
knowledge
of
the
race
which
created
them
but
they
are
the
products
of
the
highest
activity
of
man
in
the
finest
moments
of
his
life
they
represent
a
high
felicity
no
less
than
a
noble
gift
they
are
the
memorials
of
a
happiness
which
may
have
been
brief
but
which
while
it
lasted
had
a
touch
of
the
divine
in
it
for
men
are
never
nearer
divinity
than
in
their
creative
impulses
and
moments
homer
may
have
been
blind
but
if
he
composed
the
epics
which
bear
his
name
he
must
have
known
moments
of
purer
happiness
than
his
most
fortunate
contemporary
dante
missed
the
lesser
comforts
of
life
but
there
were
hours
of
transcendent
joy
in
his
lonely
career
for
the
highest
joy
of
which
men
taste
is
the
full
free
and
noble
putting
forth
of
the
power
that
is
in
them
no
moments
in
human
experience
are
so
thrilling
as
those
in
which
a
man
soul
goes
out
from
him
into
some
adequate
and
beautiful
form
of
expression
in
the
act
of
creation
a
man
incorporates
his
own
personality
into
the
visible
world
about
him
and
in
a
true
and
noble
sense
gives
himself
to
his
fellows
when
an
artist
looks
at
his
work
he
sees
himself
he
has
performed
the
highest
task
of
which
he
is
capable
and
fulfilled
the
highest
purpose
for
which
he
was
planned
by
an
artist
greater
than
himself
the
rapture
of
the
creative
mood
and
moment
is
the
reward
of
the
little
group
whose
touch
on
any
kind
of
material
is
imperishable
it
comes
when
the
spell
of
inspired
work
is
on
them
or
in
the
moment
which
follows
immediately
on
completion
and
before
the

seized
him
for
days
together
and
thackeray
knew
it
as
he
confesses
when
he
had
put
the
finishing
touches
on
that
striking
scene
in
which
rawdon
crawley
thrashes
lord
steyne
within
an
inch
of
his
wicked
life
the
great
novelist
who
happened
also
to
be
a
great
writer
knew
that
the
whole
scene
in
conception
and
execution
was
a
stroke
of
genius
but
while
this
supreme
rapture
belongs
to
a
chosen
few
it
may
be
shared
by
all
those
who
are
ready
to
open
the
imagination
to
its
approach
it
is
one
of
the
great
rewards
of
the
artist
that
while
other
kinds
of
joy
are
often
pathetically
his
joy
having
brought
forth
enduring
works
is
in
a
sense
imperishable
and
it
not
only
endures
it
renews
itself
in
kindred
moments
and
experiences
which
it
bestows
upon
those
who
approach
it
sympathetically
there
are
lines
in
the
divine
comedy
which
thrill
us
as
they
must
have
thrilled
dante
there
are
passages
in
the
shakespearian
plays
and
sonnets
which
make
a
riot
in
the
blood
as
they
doubtless
set
the
poet
pulses
beating
three
centuries
ago
the
student
of
literature
therefore
finds
in
its
noblest
works
not
only
the
ultimate
results
of
race
experience
and
the
characteristic
quality
of
race
genius
but
the
highest
activity
of
the
greatest
minds
in
their
happiest
and
most
expansive
moments
in
this
commingling
of
the
best
that
is
in
the
race
and
the
best
that
is
in
the
individual
lies
the
mystery
of
that
double
revelation
which
makes
every
work
of
art
a
disclosure
not
only
of
the
nature
of
the
man
behind
it
but
of
all
men
behind
him
in
this
commingling
too
is
preserved
the
most
precious
deposit
of
what
the
race
has
been
and
done
and
of
what
the
man
has
seen
felt
and
known
in
the
nature
of
things
no
educational
material
can
be
richer
none
so
fundamentally
expansive
and
illuminative
this
contact
with
the
richest
personalities
the
world
has
produced
is
one
of
the
deepest
sources
of
culture
for
nothing
is
more
truly
educative
than
association
with
persons
of
the
highest
intelligence
and
power
when
a
man
recalls
his
educational
experience
he
finds
that
many
of
his
richest
opportunities
were
not
identified
with
subjects
or
systems
or
apparatus
but
with
teachers
there
is
fundamental
truth
in
emerson
declaration
that
it
makes
very
little
difference
what
you
study
but
that
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
important
with
whom
you
study
there
flows
from
the
living
teacher
a
power
which
no
can
compass
or
contain
the
power
of
liberating
the
imagination
and
setting
the
student
free
to
become
an
original
investigator
supply
methods
information
and
discipline
teachers
impart
the
breath
of
life
by
giving
us
inspiration
and
impulse
now
the
great
books
are
different
from
all
other
books
in
their
possession
of
this
mysterious
vital
force
they
are
not
only
by
reason
of
the
knowledge
they
contain
but
they
are
also
books
of
life
by
reason
of
the
disclosure
of
personality
which
they
make
the
student
of
faust
receives
from
that
drama
not
only
the
poet
interpretation
of
man
life
in
the
world
but
he
is
also
brought
under
the
spell
of
goethe
personality
and
in
a
real
sense
gets
from
his
book
that
which
his
friends
got
from
the
man
this
is
not
true
of
secondary
books
it
is
true
only
of
books
secondary
books
are
often
products
of
skill
pieces
of
but
entirely
craftsmanship
books
are
always
the
expression
of
what
is
deepest
most
original
and
distinctive
in
the
nature
which
produces
them
in
such
books
therefore
we
get
not
only
the
skill
the
art
the
knowledge
we
get
above
all
the
man
there
is
added
to
what
he
has
to
give
us
of
thought
or
form
the
inestimable
boon
of
his
companionship
the
reality
of
this
element
of
personality
and
the
force
for
culture
which
resides
in
it
are
clearly
illustrated
by
a
comparison
of
the
works
of
plato
with
those
of
aristotle
aristotle
was
for
many
centuries
the
first
name
in
philosophy
and
is
still
one
of
the
greatest
but
aristotle
although
a
student
of
the
principles
of
the
art
of
literature
and
a
critic
of
deep
philosophical
insight
was
primarily
a
thinker
not
an
artist
one
goes
to
him
for
discipline
for
thought
for
training
in
a
very
high
sense
one
does
not
go
to
him
for
form
beauty
or
personality
it
is
a
clear
distinct
logical
order
of
ideas
a
definite
system
which
he
gives
us
not
a
view
of
life
a
disclosure
of
the
nature
of
man
a
synthesis
of
ideas
touched
with
beauty
dramatically
arranged
and
set
in
the
atmosphere
of
athenian
life
for
these
things
one
goes
to
plato
who
is
not
only
a
thinker
but
an
artist
of
wonderful
gifts
one
who
so
closely
and
beautifully
relates
greek
thought
to
greek
life
that
we
seem
not
to
be
studying
a
system
of
philosophy
but
mingling
with
the
society
of
athens
in
its
most
fascinating
groups
and
at
its
most
significant
moments
to
the
student
of
aristotle
the
personality
of
the
writer
counts
for
nothing
to
the
student
of
the
dialogues
on
the
other
hand
the
personality
of
plato
counts
for
everything
if
we
approach
him
as
a
thinker
it
is
true
we
discard
everything
except
his
ideas
but
if
we
approach
him
as
a
great
writer
ideas
are
but
part
of
the
rich
and
illuminating
whole
which
he
offers
us
one
can
imagine
a
man
fully
acquainting
himself
with
the
work
of
aristotle
and
yet
remaining
almost
devoid
of
culture
but
one
can
not
imagine
a
man
coming
into
intimate
companionship
with
plato
and
remaining
untouched
by
his
rich
representative
personality
from
such
a
companionship
something
must
flow
besides
an
enlargement
of
ideas
or
a
development
of
the
power
of
clear
thinking
there
must
flow
also
the
stimulating
and
illuminating
impulse
of
a
fresh
contact
with
a
great
nature
there
must
result
a
certain
liberation
of
the
imagination
a
certain
widening
of
experience
a
certain
ripening
of
the
mind
of
the
student
the
beauty
of
form
the
varied
and
vital
aspects
of
religious
social
and
individual
character
the
splendour
and
charm
of
a
nobly
ordered
art
in
temples
speech
manners
and
dress
the
constant
suggestion
of
the
deep
humanism
behind
that
art
and
of
the
freshness
and
reality
of
all
its
forms
of
expression
these
things
are
as
much
and
as
great
a
part
of
the
dialogues
as
the
thought
and
they
are
full
of
that
quality
which
enriches
and
ripens
the
mind
that
comes
under
their
influence
in
these
qualities
of
his
style
quite
as
much
as
in
his
ideas
is
to
be
found
the
real
plato
the
great
artist
who
refused
to
consider
philosophy
as
an
abstract
creation
of
the
mind
existing
so
far
as
man
is
concerned
apart
from
the
mind
which
formulates
it
but
who
saw
life
in
its
totality
and
made
thought
luminous
and
real
by
disclosing
it
at
all
points
against
the
background
of
the
life
the
nature
and
the
habits
of
the
thinker
this
is
the
method
of
culture
as
distinguished
from
that
of
scholarship
and
this
is
also
the
disclosure
of
the
personality
of
plato
as
distinguished
from
his
philosophical
genius
whoever
studies
the
dialogues
with
his
heart
as
well
as
with
his
mind
comes
into
personal
relations
with
the
richest
mind
of
antiquity
chapter
liberation
through
ideas
matthew
arnold
was
in
the
habit
of
dwelling
on
the
importance
of
a
free
movement
of
fresh
ideas
through
society
the
men
who
are
in
touch
with
such
movements
are
certain
to
be
productive
while
those
whose
minds
are
not
fed
by
this
stimulus
are
likely
to
remain
unfruitful
one
of
the
most
suggestive
and
beautiful
facts
in
the
spiritual
history
of
men
is
the
exhilaration
which
a
great
new
thought
brings
with
it
the
thrilling
moments
in
history
are
the
moments
of
contact
between
such
ideas
and
the
minds
which
are
open
to
their
approach
it
is
true
that
fresh
ideas
often
gain
acceptance
slowly
and
against
great
odds
in
the
way
of
organised
error
and
of
individual
inertness
and
dulness
nevertheless
it
is
also
true
that
certain
great
ideas
rapidly
clarify
themselves
in
the
thought
of
almost
every
century
they
are
opposed
and
rejected
by
a
multitude
but
they
are
in
the
air
as
we
say
they
seem
to
diffuse
themselves
through
all
fields
of
thought
and
they
are
often
worked
out
harmoniously
in
different
departments
by
men
who
have
no
concert
of
action
but
whose
minds
are
open
and
sensitive
to
these
invisible
currents
of
light
and
power
the
first
and
the
most
enduring
result
of
this
movement
of
ideas
is
the
enlargement
of
the
thoughts
of
men
about
themselves
and
their
world
every
great
new
truth
compels
sooner
or
later
a
readjustment
of
the
whole
body
of
organised
truth
as
men
hold
it
the
fresh
thought
about
the
physical
constitution
of
man
bears
its
fruit
ultimately
in
some
fresh
notion
of
his
spiritual
constitution
the
new
fact
in
geology
does
not
spend
its
force
until
it
has
wrought
a
modification
of
the
view
of
the
creative
method
and
the
age
of
man
in
the
world
the
fresh
conception
of
the
method
of
evolution
along
material
and
physical
lines
slowly
reconstructs
the
philosophy
of
mental
and
spiritual
development
every
new
thought
relates
itself
finally
to
all
thought
and
is
like
the
forward
step
which
continually
changes
the
horizon
about
the
traveller
the
history
of
man
is
the
story
of
the
ideas
he
has
entertained
and
accepted
and
of
his
struggle
to
incorporate
these
ideas
into
laws
customs
institutions
and
character
at
the
heart
of
every
race
one
finds
certain
ideas
not
always
clearly
seen
nor
often
definitely
formulated
save
by
a
few
persons
but
unconsciously
held
with
deathless
tenacity
and
illustrated
by
a
vast
range
of
action
and
achievement
at
the
heart
of
every
great
civilisation
one
finds
a
few
dominant
and
vital
conceptions
which
give
a
certain
coherence
and
unity
to
a
vast
movement
of
life
now
the
books
of
life
as
has
already
been
said
hold
their
place
in
universal
literature
because
they
reveal
and
illustrate
in
symbol
and
personality
these
fundamental
ideas
with
supreme
power
and
felicity
the
large
body
of
literature
in
prose
and
verse
which
is
put
between
the
covers
of
the
old
testament
not
only
gives
us
an
account
of
what
the
hebrew
race
did
in
the
world
but
of
its
ideas
about
that
world
and
of
the
character
which
it
formed
for
itself
largely
as
the
fruit
of
those
ideas
those
ideas
it
need
hardly
be
said
not
only
registered
a
great
advance
on
the
ideas
which
preceded
them
but
remain
in
many
respects
the
most
fundamental
ideas
which
the
race
as
a
whole
has
accepted
they
lifted
the
men
to
whom
they
were
originally
revealed
or
who
accepted
them
to
a
great
height
of
spiritual
and
moral
vision
and
a
race
character
was
organised
about
them
of
the
most
powerful
and
persistent
type
the
modern
student
of
the
old
testament
is
born
into
a
very
different
atmosphere
from
that
in
which
these
conceptions
of
man
and
the
universe
were
originally
formed
but
though
they
have
largely
lost
their
novelty
they
have
not
lost
the
power
of
enlargement
and
expansion
which
were
in
them
at
the
beginning
in
his
own
history
every
man
repeats
within
certain
limits
the
history
of
the
race
and
the
inexhaustible
educational
value
of
race
experience
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
so
completely
parallels
the
history
of
every
member
of
the
race
childhood
has
the
fancies
and
faiths
of
the
earliest
ages
youth
has
visions
and
dreams
which
form
generation
after
generation
a
kind
of
contemporary
mythology
maturity
aspires
after
and
sometimes
attains
the
repose
the
clear
intelligence
the
catholic
outlook
of
the
best
modern
type
of
mind
and
character
in
some
form
every
modern
man
travels
the
road
over
which
his
predecessors
have
passed
but
he
no
longer
blazes
his
path
a
highway
has
been
built
for
him
he
is
spared
the
immense
toil
of
formulating
the
ideas
by
which
he
lives
and
of
passing
through
the
searching
experience
which
is
often
the
only
approach
to
the
greatest
truths
if
he
has
originative
power
he
forms
ideas
of
his
own
but
they
are
based
on
a
massive
foundation
of
ideas
which
others
have
worked
out
for
him
he
passes
through
his
own
individual
experience
but
he
inherits
the
results
of
a
multitude
of
experiences
of
which
nothing
remains
save
certain
final
generalisations
every
intelligent
man
is
born
into
possession
of
a
world
of
knowledge
and
truth
which
has
been
explored
settled
and
organised
for
him
to
the
discovery
and
regulation
of
this
world
every
race
has
worked
with
more
or
less
definiteness
of
aim
and
the
total
result
of
the
incalculable
labours
and
sufferings
of
men
is
the
somewhat
intangible
but
very
real
thing
we
call
civilisation
at
the
heart
of
civilisation
and
determining
its
form
and
quality
is
that
group
of
vital
ideas
to
which
each
race
has
contributed
according
to
its
intelligence
and
power
the
measure
of
the
greatness
of
a
race
being
determined
by
the
value
of
its
contribution
to
this
organised
spiritual
life
of
the
world
this
body
of
ideas
is
the
highest
product
of
the
life
of
men
under
historic
conditions
it
is
the
quintessence
of
whatever
was
best
and
enduring
not
only
in
their
thought
but
in
their
feeling
their
instinct
their
affections
their
activities
and
the
degree
in
which
the
man
of
is
able
to
appropriate
this
rich
result
of
the
deepest
life
of
the
past
is
the
measure
of
his
culture
one
may
be
and
carefully
disciplined
and
yet
have
no
share
in
this
organised
life
of
the
race
but
no
one
can
possess
real
culture
who
has
not
according
to
his
ability
entered
into
it
by
making
it
a
part
of
himself
it
is
by
contact
with
these
great
ideas
that
the
individual
mind
puts
itself
in
touch
with
the
universal
mind
and
indefinitely
expands
and
enriches
itself
culture
rests
on
ideas
rather
than
on
knowledge
its
distinctive
use
of
knowledge
is
to
gain
material
for
ideas
for
this
reason
the
iliad
and
odyssey
are
of
more
importance
than
thucydides
and
curtius
for
homer
was
not
only
in
a
very
important
sense
the
historian
of
his
race
he
was
above
all
the
expositor
of
its
ideas
there
is
involved
in
the
very
structure
of
the
greek
epics
the
fundamental
conception
of
life
as
the
greeks
looked
at
it
their
view
of
reverence
worship
law
obligation
subordination
personality
no
one
can
be
said
to
have
read
these
poems
in
any
real
sense
until
he
has
made
these
ideas
clear
to
himself
and
these
ideas
carry
with
them
a
definite
enlargement
of
thought
when
a
man
has
gotten
a
clear
view
of
the
ideas
about
life
held
by
a
great
race
he
has
gone
a
long
way
towards
so
rich
and
illuminative
are
these
central
conceptions
around
which
the
life
of
each
race
has
been
organised
to
multiply
these
ideas
by
broad
contact
with
the
books
of
life
is
to
expand
one
thought
so
as
to
compass
the
essential
thought
of
the
entire
race
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
man
of
broad
culture
accomplishes
he
emancipates
himself
from
whatever
is
local
provincial
and
temporal
by
gaining
the
power
of
taking
the
race
point
of
view
he
is
liberated
by
ideas
not
only
from
his
own
ignorance
and
the
limitations
of
his
own
nature
but
from
the
partial
knowledge
and
the
prejudices
of
his
time
and
liberation
by
ideas
and
expansion
through
ideas
constitute
one
of
the
great
services
of
the
books
of
life
to
those
who
read
them
with
an
open
mind
chapter
xi
the
logic
of
free
life
the
ideas
which
form
the
substance
or
substratum
of
the
greatest
books
are
not
primarily
the
products
of
pure
thought
they
have
a
far
deeper
origin
and
their
immense
power
of
enlightenment
and
enrichment
lies
in
the
depth
of
their
rootage
in
the
unconscious

it
be
true

far
as
we
can
understand
them
is
not
intellectual
but
vital
then
it
is
also
true
that
the
formative
ideas
by
which
we
live
and
in
the
clear
comprehension
of
which
the
greatness
of
intellectual
and
spiritual
life
for
us
lies
have
been
borne
in
upon
the
race
by
living
rather
than
by
thinking
they
are
felt
and
experienced
first
and
formulated
later
it
is
clear
that
a
definite
purpose
is
being
wrought
out
through
physical
processes
in
the
world
of
matter
it
is
equally
clear
to
most
men
that
moral
and
spiritual
purposes
are
being
worked
out
through
the
processes
which
constitute
the
conditions
of
our
being
and
acting
in
this
world
it
has
been
the
engrossing
and
fruitful
study
of
science
to
discover
the
processes
and
comprehend
the
ends
of
the
physical
order
it
is
the
highest
office
of
art
to
discover
and
illustrate
for
the
most
part
unconsciously
the
processes
and
results
of
the
spiritual
order
by
setting
forth
in
concrete
form
the
underlying
and
formative
ideas
of
races
and
periods
the
thought
that
makes
the
work
of
art
says
john
la
farge
in
a
discussion
of
the
art
of
painting
of
singular
insight
and
intelligence
the
thought
which
in
its
highest
expression
we
call
genius
is
not
reflection
or
reflective
thought
the
thought
which
analyses
has
the
same
deficiencies
as
our
eyes
it
can
fix
only
one
point
at
a
time
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
examine
each
element
of
consideration
and
unite
it
to
others
to
make
a
whole
but
the
of
free
life
which
is
the
logic
of
is
like
that
logic
of
one
using
the
eye
in
which
we
make
most
wonderful
combinations
of
momentary
adaptation
by
innumerable
memories
by
rejecting
those
that
are
useless
or
antagonistic
and
all
without
being
aware
of
it
so
that
those
especially
who
most
use
the
eye
as
for
instance
the
painter
or
the
hunter
are
unaware
of
more
than
one
single
instantaneous
action
this
is
a
very
happy
formulation
of
a
fundamental
principle
in
art
indeed
it
brings
before
us
the
essential
quality
of
art
its
illustration
of
thought
in
the
order
not
of
a
formal
logic
but
of
the
logic
of
free
life
it
is
at
this
point
that
it
is
differentiated
from
philosophy
it
is
from
this
point
that
its
immense
spiritual
significance
becomes
clear
in
the
great
books
fundamental
ideas
are
set
forth
not
in
a
systematic
way
nor
as
the
results
of
methodical
teaching
but
as
they
rise
over
the
vast
territory
of
actual
living
and
are
clarified
by
the
and
experience
of
the
race
every
book
of
the
first
order
in
literature
of
the
creative
kind
is
a
final
generalisation
from
a
vast
experience
it
is
to
use
la
phrase
the
of
innumerable
memories
memories
shared
by
an
innumerable
company
of
persons
and
becoming
at
length
and
after
long
clarification
a
kind
of
race
memory
and
this
memory
is
so
inclusive
and
tenacious
that
it
holds
intact
the
long
and
varied
play
of
soil
sky
scenery
climate
faith
myth
suffering
action
historic
process
through
which
the
race
has
passed
and
by
which
it
has
been
largely
formed
the
ideas
which
underlie
the
great
books
bring
with
them
therefore
when
we
really
receive
them
into
our
minds
the
entire
background
of
the
life
out
of
which
they
took
their
rise
we
are
not
only
permitted
to
refresh
ourselves
at
the
inexhaustible
spring
but
as
we
drink
the
entire
sweep
of
landscape
to
the
remotest
mountains
in
whose
heart
its
sources
are
hidden
encompasses
us
like
a
vast
living
world
it
is
in
other
words
the
totality
of
things
which
great
art
gives
us
not
things
in
isolation
and
detachment
la
farge
will
pardon
further
quotation
he
admirably
states
this
great
truth
when
he
says
that
in
a
work
of
art
executed
through
the
body
and
appealing
to
the
mind
through
the
senses
the
entire
of
its
creator
addresses
the
entire
constitution
of
the
man
for
whom
it
is
meant
one
may
go
further
and
say
of
the
greatest
books
that
the
whole
race
speaks
through
them
to
the
whole
man
who
puts
himself
in
a
receptive
mood
towards
them
this
totality
of
influences
conditions
and
history
which
goes
to
the
making
of
books
of
this
order
receives
dramatic
unity
artistic
sequence
and
integral
order
and
coherence
from
the
personality
of
the
writer
he
gathers
into
himself
the
spiritual
results
of
the
experience
of
his
people
or
his
age
and
through
his
genius
for
expression
the
vast
general
background
of
his
personal
life
which
as
in
the
case
of
homer
for
instance
has
entirely
faded
from
view
rises
once
more
in
clear
vision
before
us
in
any
museum
says
la
farge
we
can
see
certain
great
differences
in
things
which
are
so
evident
so
much
on
the
surface
as
almost
to
be
our
first
impressions
they
are
the
marks
of
the
places
where
the
works
of
art
were
born
climate
intensity
of
heat
and
light
the
nature
of
the
earth
whether
there
was
much
or
little
water
in
proportion
to
land
plants
animals
surrounding
beings
have
helped
to
make
these
differences
as
well
as
manners
laws
religions
and
national
ideals
if
you
recall
the
more
general
physical
impression
of
a
gallery
of
flemish
paintings
and
of
a
gallery
of
italian
masters
you
will
have
carried
off
in
yourself
two
distinct
impressions
received
during
their
lives
by
the
men
of
these
two
races
the
fact
that
they
used
their
eyes
more
or
less
is
only
a
small
factor
in
this
enormous
aggregation
of
influences
received
by
them
and
transmitted
to
us
from
this
point
of
view
the
inexhaustible
significance
of
a
great
work
of
art
becomes
clear
both
as
regards
its
definite
revelation
of
racial
and
individual
truth
and
as
regards
its
educational
or
culture
quality
and
value
ideas
are
presented
not
in
isolation
and
detachment
but
in
their
totality
of
origin
and
relationship
they
are
not
abstractions
general
propositions
philosophical
generalisations
they
are
living
truths
truths
that
is
which
have
become
clear
by
long
experience
and
to
which
men
stand
or
have
stood
in
personal
relations
they
are
ideas
in
other
words
which
stand
together
not
in
the
order
of
formal
logic
but
of
the
logic
of
free
life
they
are
not
torn
out
of
their
normal
relations
they
bring
all
their
relationships
with
them
we
are
offered
a
plant
in
the
soil
not
a
flower
cut
from
its
stem
every
man
is
rooted
to
the
soil
touches
through
his
senses
the
physical
and
through
his
mind
and
heart
the
spiritual
order
of
his
time
all
these
influences
are
focussed
in
him
and
according
to
his
capacity
he
gathers
them
into
his
experience
formulates
and
expresses
them
the
greater
and
more
productive
the
man
the
wider
his
contact
with
and
absorption
of
the
life
of
his
time
for
the
artist
stands
nearest
not
farthest
from
his
contemporaries
he
is
not
however
a
mere
medium
in
their
hands
not
a
mere
secretary
or
recorder
of
their
ideas
and
feelings
he
is
separated
from
them
in
the
clearness
of
his
vision
of
the
significance
of
their
activities
the
ends
towards
which
they
are
moving
the
ideas
which
they
are
working
out
but
in
the
exact
degree
of
his
greatness
he
is
one
with
them
in
sympathy
experience
and
comprehension
they
live
for
him
and
he
lives
with
them
they
work
out
ideas
in
the
logic
of
free
life
and
he
clarifies
interprets
and
illustrates
those
ideas
the
world
is
not
saved
the
remnant
as
matthew
arnold
held
it
is
saved
the
remnant
the
elect
of
the
race
its
prophets
teachers
artists
and
every
great
artist
is
also
a
prophet
and
teacher
are
its
leaders
not
its
masters
its
interpreters
not
its
creators
the
race
is
dumb
without
its
artists
but
the
artists
would
be
impossible
without
the
sustaining
fellowship
of
the
race
in
the
making
of
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
the
greek
race
was
in
full
partnership
with
homer
the
ideas
which
form
the
summits
of
human
achievement
are
sustained
by
immense
masses
of
earth
the
higher
they
rise
the
vaster
their
bases
the
richer
and
wider
the
race
life
the
freer
and
deeper
the
play
of
that
vital
logic
which
produces
the
formative
ideas
chapter
xii
the
imagination
the
lady
of
shalott
sitting
in
her
tower
looked
into
her
magic
mirror
and
saw
the
whole
world
go
by
monk
maiden
priest
knight
lady
and
king
in
the
mirror
of
the
imagination
not
only
the
world
of
but
the
entire
movement
of
human
life
moves
before
the
eye
as
the
throngs
of
living
men
move
on
the
streets
for
the
imagination
is
the
real
magician
of
whose
marvels
all
simulated
magic
is
but
a
clumsy
and
mechanical
imitation
it
is
the
real
power
of
which
all
material
powers
are
very
inadequate
symbols
rarely
taken
into
account
by
teachers
largely
ignored
by
educational
systems
and
philosophies
it
is
the
divinest
of
all
the
powers
which
men
are
able
to
put
forth
because
it
is
the
creative
power
it
uses
thought
but
in
a
way
it
is
greater
than
thought
because
it
builds
out
of
thought
that
which
thought
alone
is
powerless
to
construct
it
is
indeed
the
essential
element
in
great
constructive
thinking
for
while
we
may
have
thoughts
untouched
by
the
imagination
one
can
not
think
along
high
constructive
lines
without
its
constant
aid
isolated
thoughts
come
unattended
by
it
but
the
thinking
which
issues
in
organised
systems
in
comprehensive
interpretations
of
things
and
events
in
those
noble
generalisations
which
have
the
splendour
of
the
discovery
of
new
worlds
in
them
in
those
concrete
embodiments
of
idea
which
we
call
works
of
art
is
conditioned
on
the
use
of
the
imagination
dialogues
were
fashioned
by
it
as
truly
as
homer
poems
philosophy
was
created
by
it
as
definitely
as
shakespeare
plays
and
newton
and
kepler
used
it
as
freely
as
dante
or
rembrandt
upon
the
use
of
this
supreme
faculty
we
depend
not
only
for
creative
power
but
for
education
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
for
culture
is
the
highest
result
of
education
and
the
final
test
of
education
is
its
power
to
produce
culture
goethe
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
sympathy
is
essential
to
all
true
criticism
for
no
man
can
discern
the
heart
of
a
movement
of
a
work
of
art
or
of
a
race
who
does
not
put
himself
into
heart
relations
with
that
which
he
is
trying
to
understand
we
never
really
possess
an
idea
a
bit
of
knowledge
or
a
fact
of
experience
until
we
get
below
the
mind
of
it
into
the
heart
of
it
now
sympathy
in
this
sense
is
the
imagination
touched
with
feeling
it
is
the
imagination
bringing
thought
and
emotion
into
vital
relation
in
the
process
of
culture
therefore
the
imagination
plays
a
great
part
for
culture
it
can
not
too
often
be
said
is
knowledge
observation
and
experience
incorporate
into
personality
and
become
part
of
the
very
nature
of
the
individual
the
man
of
culture
is
a
man
of
imagination
lacking
this
quality
he
may
become
learned
by
force
of
industry
or
a
scholar
by
virtue
of
a
trained
intelligence
but
the
ripeness
the
balance
the
peculiar
richness
of
fibre
which
characterise
the
man
of
culture
will
be
denied
him
the
man
of
culture
it
is
true
is
not
always
a
man
of
creative
power
but
he
is
never
devoid
of
that
kind
of
creative
quality
which
transforms
everything
he
receives
into
something
personal
and
individual
and
the
more
deeply
one
studies
the
work
of
the
great
artists
the
more
distinctly
does
he
see
the
immense
place
which
culture
in
the
vital
as
contrasted
with
the
academic
sense
held
in
their
lives
and
the
great
part
it
played
in
their
productive
activity
dante
goethe
tennyson
browning
lowell
were
men
possessed
in
rare
degree
of
culture
of
both
kinds
but
shakespeare
and
burns
were
equally
men
of
culture
they
shared
in
the
possession
of
this
faculty
of
making
all
they
saw
and
knew
a
part
of
themselves
between
culture
of
this
quality
and
the
creative
power
there
is
something
more
than
complete
unity
there
is
almost
identity
for
they
seem
to
be
two
forms
of
activity
of
the
same
power
rather
than
distinct
faculties
culture
enables
us
to
receive
the
world
into
ourselves
not
in
the
reflection
of
a
magic
mirror
but
in
the
depths
of
a
living
soul
to
receive
that
world
in
such
a
way
that
we
possess
it
it
ceases
to
be
outside
us
and
becomes
part
of
our
very
nature
the
creative
power
enables
us
to
refashion
that
world
and
to
put
it
forth
again
out
of
ourselves
as
it
was
originally
put
forth
out
of
the
life
of
the
divine
artist
the
creative
process
is
therefore
a
double
process
and
culture
and
genius
stand
in
indissoluble
union
the
development
of
the
imagination
upon
the
power
of
which
both
absorption
of
knowledge
and
creative
capacity
depend
is
therefore
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
to
this
necessity
educators
will
some
day
open
their
eyes
and
educational
systems
will
some
day
conform
meantime
it
must
be
done
mainly
by
individual
work
knowledge
discipline
and
technical
training
of
the
best
sort
are
accessible
on
every
hand
but
the
development
of
the
faculty
which
unites
all
these
in
the
highest
form
of
activity
must
be
secured
mainly
by
personal
effort
the
richest
and
most
accessible
material
for
this
highest
education
is
furnished
by
art
and
the
form
of
art
within
reach
of
every
civilised
man
at
all
times
in
all
places
is
the
book
to
these
masterpieces
which
have
been
called
the
books
of
life
all
men
may
turn
with
the
assurance
that
as
the
supreme
achievements
of
the
imagination
they
have
the
power
of
awakening
stimulating
and
enriching
it
in
the
highest
degree
for
the
genuine
reader
who
sees
in
a
book
what
the
writer
has
put
there
repeats
in
a
way
the
process
through
which
the
maker
of
the
book
passed
the
man
who
reads
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
with
his
heart
as
well
as
his
intelligence
must
measurably
enter
into
the
life
which
these
poems
describe
and
interpret
he
must
identify
himself
for
the
time
with
the
race
whose
soul
and
historic
character
are
revealed
in
epic
form
as
in
a
great
mirror
he
must
see
life
from
the
greek
point
of
view
and
feel
life
as
the
greek
felt
it
he
must
in
a
word
go
through
the
process
by
which
the
poems
were
made
as
well
as
feel
comprehend
and
enjoy
their
final
perfection
in
like
manner
the
and
reader
of
the
book
of
job
can
not
rest
content
with
that
noble
poem
in
the
form
which
it
now
possesses
the
imaginative
impulse
which
even
the
casual
reading
of
the
poem
liberates
in
him
sends
him
behind
the
finished
product
to
the
life
of
which
it
was
the
immortal
fruit
he
enters
into
the
groping
thought
of
an
age
which
has
perished
out
of
all
other
remembrance
he
deals
with
a
problem
which
is
as
old
as
man
from
the
standpoint
of
men
who
have
left
no
other
record
of
themselves
in
proportion
to
the
depth
of
his
feeling
and
the
vitality
of
his
imagination
he
must
saturate
himself
with
the
rich
life
of
thought
conviction
and
emotion
of
struggle
and
aspiration
out
of
which
the
greatest
of
the
poems
of
nature
took
its
rise
he
must
in
a
word
receive
into
himself
the
living
material
upon
which
the
unknown
poet
worked
in
such
a
process
the
imagination
is
evoked
in
full
and
free
play
it
insensibly
reconstructs
a
life
gone
out
of
knowledge
selects
harmonises
unifies
and
in
a
measure
creates
it
illuminates
and
unifies
knowledge
divines
the
wide
relations
of
thought
and
discerns
its
place
in
organic
connection
with
the
world
which
gave
it
birth
the
material
upon
which
this
great
power
is
nourished
is
specifically
furnished
by
the
works
which
it
has
created
as
the
eye
is
trained
to
discover
the
line
of
beauty
by
companionship
with
the
works
in
which
it
is
revealed
with
the
greatest
clearness
and
power
so
is
the
imagination
developed
by
intimacy
with
the
books
which
disclose
its
depth

reality
and
its
method
the
reader
of
shakespeare
can
not
follow
the
leadings
of
his
masterly
imagination
without
feeling
a
liberation
of
his
own
faculty
of
seeing
things
as
parts
of
a
vast
order
of
life
he
does
not
gain
the
poet
creative
power
but
he
is
enlarged
and
enriched
to
the
point
where
his
own
imagination
plays
directly
on
the
material
about
it
he
receives
it
into
himself
and
in
the
exact
measure
in
which
he
learns
the
secret
of
absorbing
what
he
sees
feels
and
knows
becomes
master
and
interpreter
of
the
world
of
his
time
and
restorer
of
the
world
of

chapter
xiii
breadth
of
life
one
of
the
prime
characteristics
of
the
man
of
culture
is
freedom
from
provincialism
complete
deliverance
from
rigidity
of
temper
narrowness
of
interest
uncertainty
of
taste
and
general
unripeness
the
villager
or
pagan
in
the
old
sense
is
always
a
provincial
his
horizon
is
narrow
his
outlook
upon
the
world
restricted
his
knowledge
of
life
limited
he
may
know
a
few
things
thoroughly
he
can
not
know
them
in
true
relation
to
one
another
or
to
the
larger
order
of
which
they
are
part
he
may
know
a
few
persons
intimately
he
can
not
know
the
representative
persons
of
his
time
or
of
his
race
the
essence
of
provincialism
is
the
substitution
of
a
part
for
the
whole
the
acceptance
of
the
local
experience
knowledge
and
standards
as
possessing
the
authority
of
the
universal
experience
knowledge
and
standards
the
local
experience
is
entirely
true
in
its
own
sphere
it
becomes
misleading
when
it
is
accepted
as
the
experience
of
all
time
and
all
men
it
is
this
mistake
which
breeds
that
narrowness
and
uncertainty
of
taste
and
opinion
from
which
culture
furnishes
the
only
escape
a
small
community
isolated
from
other
communities
by
the
accidents
of
position
often
comes
to
believe
that
its
way
of
doing
things
is
the
way
of
the
world
a
small
body
of
religious
people
devoutly
attentive
to
their
own
observances
often
reach
the
conclusion
that
these
observances
are
the
practice
of
that
catholic
church
which
includes
the
of
all
creeds
and
rituals
a
group
of
radical
reformers
by
passionate
advocacy
of
a
single
reform
come
to
believe
that
there
have
been
no
reformers
before
them
and
that
none
will
be
needed
after
them
a
band
of
fresh
and
audacious
young
practitioners
of
any
of
the
arts
by
dint
of
insistence
upon
a
certain
manner
rapidly
generate
the
conviction
that
art
has
no
other
manner
society
is
full
of
provincialism
in
art
politics
religion
and
economics
and
the
essence
of
this
provincialism
is
always
the
same
the
substitution
of
a
part
for
the
whole
larger
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
history
would
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
has
always
been
not
only
a
wide
latitude
but
great
variation
in
ritual
and
worship
that
the
political
story
of
all
the
progressive
nations
has
been
one
long
agitation
for
reforms
and
that
no
reform
can
ever
be
final
that
reform
must
succeed
reform
until
the
end
of
time
reforms
being
in
their
nature
neither
more
nor
less
than
those
readjustments
to
new
conditions
which
are
involved
in
all
social
development
a
wider
survey
of
experience
would
make
it
clear
that
art
has
many
manners
and
that
no
manner
is
supreme
and
none
final
a
long
experience
gives
a
man
poise
balance
and
steadiness
he
has
seen
many
things
come
and
go
and
he
is
neither
paralysed
by
depression
when
society
goes
wrong
nor
irrationally
elated
when
it
goes
right
he
is
perfectly
aware
that
his
party
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
and
not
a
piece
of
indestructible
and
infallible
machinery
that
the
creed
he
accepts
has
passed
through
many
changes
of
interpretation
and
will
pass
through
more
that
the
social
order
for
which
he
contends
if
secured
will
be
only
another
stage
in
the
unbroken
development
of
the
organised
life
of
men
in
the
world
and
culture
is
at
bottom
only
an
enlarged
and
clarified
experience
an
experience
so
comprehensive
that
it
puts
its
possessor
in
touch
with
all
times
and
men
and
gives
him
the
opportunity
of
comparing
his
own
knowledge
of
things
his
faith
and
his
practice
with
the
knowledge
faith
and
practice
of
all
the
generations
this
opportunity
brings
to
one
who
knows
how
to
use
it
deliverance
from
the
ignorance
or
of
provincialism
from
the
crudity
of
its
tastes
and
from
the
blind
passion
of
its
rash
and
groundless
faith
in
its
own
infallibility
provincialism
is
the
soil
in
which
philistinism
grows
most
rapidly
and
widely
for
as
the
essence
of
provincialism
is
the
substitution
of
a
part
for
the
whole
so
the
essence
of
philistinism
is
the
conviction
that
what
one
possesses
is
the
best
of
its
kind
that
the
kind
is
the
highest
and
that
one
has
all
he
needs
of
it
a
true
philistine
is
not
only
convinced
that
he
holds
the
only
true
and
consistent
position
but
he
is
also
entirely
satisfied
with
himself
he
is
infallible
and
he
is
sufficient
unto
himself
in
politics
he
is
a
blind
partisan
in
theology
an
arrogant
dogmatist
in
art
an
ignorant
propagandist
what
he
accepts
believes
or
has
is
not
only
the
best
of
its
kind
but
nothing
better
can
ever
supersede
it
to
this
spirit
the
spirit
of
culture
is
antipodal
between
the
two
there
is
inextinguishable
antagonism
they
can
never
compromise
or
agree
upon
a
truce
any
more
than
day
and
night
can
consent
to
dwell
together
to
destroy
philistinism
root
and
branch
to
eradicate
the
ignorance
which
makes
it
possible
for
a
man
to
believe
that
he
possesses
all
things
in
their
final
forms
to
empty
a
man
of
the
stupidity
and
vulgarity
of
and
to
invigorate
the
immortal
dissatisfaction
of
the
soul
with
its
present
attainments
are
the
ends
which
culture
is
always
seeking
to
accomplish
the
keen
lance
of
matthew
arnold
flashing
now
in
one
part
of
the
field
and
now
in
another
pierced
many
of
the
fallacies
of
provincialism
and
philistinism
and
mortally
wounded
more
than
one
goliath
of
ignorance
and
conceit
but
the
work
must
be
done
anew
in
every
generation
and
in
every
individual
all
men
are
conceived
in
the
sin
of
ignorance
and
born
in
the
iniquity
of
and
every
man
needs
to
be
saved
by
wider
knowledge
and
clearer
vision
it
is
a
matter
of
comparative
indifference
where
one
is
born
it
is
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
how
one
educates
one
self
there
is
as
genuine
a
provincialism
in
paris
as
in
the
remotest
frontier
town
it
is
better
dressed
and
better
mannered
but
it
is
not
less
narrow
and
vulgar
there
is
as
much
vulgarity
in
the
arrogance
of
a
czar
as
in
that
of
an
african
chief
as
much
absurdity
in
the
of
the
man
who
believes
that
the
habit
and
speech
of
the
boulevard
are
the
ultimate
habit
and
speech
of
the
race
as
in
that
of
the
man
who
accepts
the
manners
of
the
mining
camp
as
the
finalities
of
human
intercourse
culture
is
not
an
accident
of
birth
although
surroundings
retard
or
advance
it
it
is
always
a
matter
of
individual
education
this
education
finds
no
richer
material
than
that
which
is
contained
in
literature
for
the
characteristic
of
literature
as
of
all
the
arts
is
its
universality
of
interest
its
elevation
of
taste
its
disclosure
of
ideas
its
constant
appeal
to
the
highest
in
the
reader
by
its
revelation
of
the
highest
in
the
writer
many
of
the
noblest
works
of
literature
are
intensely
local
in
colour
atmosphere
material
and
allusion
but
in
every
case
that
which
is
of
universal
interest
is
touched
evoked
and
expressed
the
artist
makes
the
figure
he
paints
stand
out
with
the
greatest
distinctness
by
the
accuracy
of
the
details
introduced
and
by
the
skill
with
which
they
are
handled
but
the
very
definiteness
of
the
figure
gives
force
and
clearness
to
the
revelation
of
the
universal
trait
or
characteristic
which
is
made
through
it
père
goriot
has
the
ineffaceable
stamp
of
paris
upon
him
but
he
is
for
that
very
reason
the
more
completely
disclosed
as
a
typical
individuality
literature
abounds
in
illustrations
of
this
true
and
artistic
adjustment
of
the
local
to
the
universal
this
disclosure
of
the
common
humanity
in
which
all
men
share
through
the
highly
elaborated
individuality
and
this
characteristic
indicates
one
of
the
deepest
sources
of
its
educational
power
so
searching
is
this
power
that
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
one
can
know
thoroughly
the
great
books
of
the
world
and
remain
a
provincial
or
a
philistine
the
very
air
of
these
works
is
fatal
to
narrow
views
to
low
standards
and
to
chapter
xiv
racial
experience
there
is
a
general
agreement
among
men
that
experience
is
the
most
effective
and
successful
of
teachers
that
for
many
men
no
other
form
of
education
is
possible
and
that
those
who
enjoy
the
fullest
educational
opportunities
miss
the
deeper
processes
of
training
if
they
fail
of
that
wide
contact
with
the
happenings
of
life
which
we
call
experience
to
touch
the
world
at
many
points
to
come
into
relations
with
many
kinds
of
men
to
think
to
feel
and
to
act
on
a
generous
scale
these
are
prime
opportunities
for
growth
for
it
is
not
only
true
as
browning
said
so
often
and
in
so
many
kinds
of
speech
that
a
man
greatest
good
fortune
is
to
have
the
opportunity
of
giving
out
freely
and
powerfully
all
the
force
that
is
in
him
but
it
is
also
true
that
almost
equal
good
fortune
attends
the
man
who
has
the
opportunity
of
receiving
truth
and
instruction
through
a
wide
and
rich
experience
but
individual
experience
however
inclusive
and
deep
is
necessarily
limited
and
the
life
of
the
greatest
man
would
be
confined
within
narrow
boundaries
if
he
were
shut
within
the
circle
of
his
own
individual
contact
with
things
and
persons
if
shakespeare
had
written
of
those
things
only
of
which
he
had
personal
knowledge
of
those
experiences
in
which
he
had
personally
shared
his
contribution
to
literature
would
be
deeply
interesting
but
it
would
not
possess
that
quality
of
universality
which
makes
it
the
property
of
the
race
in
shakespeare
there
was
not
only
knowledge
of
man
but
knowledge
of
men
as
well
his
greatness
rests
not
only
on
his
own
commanding
personality
but
on
his
magical
power
of
laying
other
personalities
under
tribute
for
the
enlargement
of
his
view
of
things
and
the
enrichment
of
his
portraiture
of
humanity
a
man
learns
much
from
his
own
contacts
with
his
time
and
his
race
but
one
of
the
most
important
gains
he
makes
is
the
development
of
the
faculty
of
appropriating
the
results
of
the
contacts
of
other
men
with
other
times
and
races
and
one
of
the
finer
qualities
of
rich
experience
is
the
quickening
of
the
imagination
to
divine
that
which
is
hidden
in
the
experience
of
other
races
and
ages
the
man
of
culture
must
not
only
live
deeply
and
intelligently
in
his
own
experience
rationalising
and
utilising
it
as
he
passes
through
it
he
must
also
break
away
from
its
limitations
and
escape
its
tendency
to
substitute
a
part
of
life
distinctly
seen
for
the
whole
of
life
vaguely
discerned
the
great
writer
for
instance
must
first
make
his
own
nature
rich
in
its
development
and
powerful
in
harmony
of
aim
and
force
and
he
must
also
make
this
nature
sensitive
sympathetic
and
clairvoyant
in
its
relations
with
the
natures
of
other
men
to
become
and
yet
to
be
able
to
pass
entirely
out
of
one
self
into
the
thoughts
emotions
impulses
and
sufferings
of
others
involves
a
harmonising
of
opposing
tendencies
which
is
difficult
of
attainment
it
is
precisely
this
poise
which
men
of
the
highest
productive
power
secure
for
it
is
this
nice
adjustment
of
the
individual
discovery
of
truth
to
the
general
discovery
of
truth
which
gives
a
man
of
imaginative
faculty
range
power
and
sanity
of
view
to
see
feel
think
and
act
strongly
and
intelligently
in
our
own
individual
world
gives
us
relations
to
that
world
and
knowledge
of
it
to
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
this
small
sphere
which
we
touch
with
our
own
hands
into
the
larger
spheres
which
other
men
touch
not
only
widens
our
knowledge
but
vastly
increases
our
power
it
is
like
exchanging
the
power
of
a
small
stream
for
the
general
power
which
plays
through
nature
one
of
the
measures
of
greatness
is
furnished
by
this
ability
to
pass
through
individual
into
national
or
racial
experience
for
a
man
spiritual
dimensions
as
revealed
through
any
form
of
art
are
determined
by
his
power
of
discerning
essential
qualities
and
experiences
in
the
greatest
number
of
people
the
four
writers
who
hold
the
highest
places
in
literature
justify
their
claims
by
their
universality
that
is
to
say
by
the
range
of
their
knowledge
of
life
as
that
knowledge
lies
revealed
in
the
experience
of
the
race
it
is
the
fortune
of
a
very
small
group
of
men
in
any
age
to
possess
the
power
of
divining
by
the
gift
of
genius
the
world
which
lies
nebulous
and
shadowy
in
the
lives
of
men
about
them
or
in
the
lives
of
men
of
other
times
in
the
nature
of
things
the
clairvoyant
vision
of
poets
like
tennyson
browning
and
hugo
of
novelists
like
thackeray
balzac
and
tolstoi
is
not
at
the
command
of
all
men
and
yet
all
men
may
share
in
it
and
be
enlarged
by
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
services
which
literature
renders
to
its
lover
it
makes
him
a
companion
of
the
most
interesting
personalities
in
their
most
significant
moments
it
enables
him
to
break
the
bars
of
individual
experience
and
escape
into
the
wider
and
richer
life
of
the
race
within
the
compass
of
a
very
small
room
on
a
very
few
shelves
the
real
story
of
man
in
this
world
may
be
collected
in
the
books
of
life
in
which
it
is
written
and
the
solitary
reader
whose
personal
contacts
with
men
and
events
are
few
and
lacking
in
distinction
and
interest
may
enter
through
his
books
into
the
most
thrilling
life
of
the
race
in
some
of
its
most
significant
moments
no
man
can
read
in
memoriam
or
the
ring
and
the
book
without
passing
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
individual
experience
into
experiences
which
broaden
and
quicken
his
own
spirit
and
no
one
can
become
familiar
with
the
novels
of
tourguéneff
or
tolstoi
without
touching
life
at
new
points
and
passing
through
emotions
which
would
never
have
been
stirred
in
him
by
the
happenings
of
his
own
life
such
a
story
as
anna
karénina
leaves
no
reader
of
imagination
or
heart
entirely
unchanged
its
elemental
moral
and
artistic
force
strikes
into
every
receptive
mind
and
leaves
there
a
knowledge
of
life
not
possessed
before
the
work
of
the
russian
novelists
has
been
indeed
a
new
reading
in
the
book
of
experience
it
has
made
a
notable
addition
to
the
sum
total
of
humanity
knowledge
of
itself
in
the
pages
of
gogol
dostoievski
tourguéneff
and
tolstoi
the
majority
of
readers
have
found
a
world
absolutely
new
to
them
and
in
reading
those
pages
so
penetrated
with
the
dramatic
spirit
they
have
come
into
the
possession
of
a
knowledge
of
life
not
formal
and
didactic
but
deep
vital
and
racial
in
its
range
and
significance
to
possess
the
knowledge
of
an
experience
at
once
so
remote
and
so
rich
in
disclosure
of
character
so
charged
with
tragic
interest
is
to
push
back
the
horizons
of
our
own
experience
to
secure
a
real
contribution
to
our
own
enrichment
and
development
whoever
carries
that
process
far
enough
brings
into
his
individual
experience
much
of
the
richness
and
splendour
of
the
experience

freshness
of
feeling
the
primary
charm
of
art
resides
in
the
freshness
of
feeling
which
it
reveals
and
conveys
an
art
which
discloses
fatigue
weariness
exhaustion
of
emotion
deadening
of
interest
has
parted
with
its
magical
spell
for
vitality
emotion
passionate
interest
in
the
experiences
of
life
devout
acceptance
of
the
facts
of
life
are
the
prime
characteristics
of
art
in
those
moments
when
its
veracity
and
power
are
at
the
highest
point
a
great
work
of
art
may
be
tragic
in
the
view
of
life
which
it
presents
but
it
must
show
no
sign
of
the
succumbing
of
the
spirit
to
the
appalling
facts
with
which
it
deals
even
in
those
cases
in
which
as
in
the
tragedy
of
king
lear
blind
fate
seems
relentlessly
sovereign
over
human
affairs
the
artist
must
disclose
in
his
attitude
and
method
a
sustained
energy
of
spirit
nothing
shows
so
clearly
a
decline
in
creative
force
as
a
loss
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
artist
in
the
subject
or
material
with
which
he
deals
that
fresh
bloom
which
lies
on
the
very
face
of
poetry
and
in
which
not
only
its
obvious
but
its
enduring
charm
resides
is
the
expression
of
a
feeling
for
nature
for
life
and
for
the
happenings
which
make
up
the
common
lot
which
keeps
its
earliest
receptivity
and
responsiveness
when
a
man
ceases
to
care
deeply
for
things
he
ceases
to
represent
or
interpret
them
with
insight
and
power
the
preservation
of
feeling
is
therefore
essential
in
all
artistic
work
and
when
it
is
lost
the
artist
becomes
an
echo
or
an
imitation
of
his
nobler
self
and
work
it
is
the
beautiful
quality
of
the
true
art
instinct
that
it
constantly
sees
and
feels
the
familiar
world
with
a
kind
of
childlike
directness
and
delight
that
which
has
become
commonplace
to
most
men
is
as
full
of
charm
and
novelty
to
the
artist
as
if
it
had
just
been
created
he
sees
it
with
fresh
eyes
and
feels
it
with
a
fresh
heart
to
such
a
spirit
nothing
becomes
stale
and
hackneyed
everything
remains
new
fresh
and
significant
it
has
often
been
said
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
children
the
world
would
lose
the
faith
the
enthusiasm
the
delight
which
constantly
renew
its
spirit
and
reinforce
its
courage
a
world
grown
old
in
feeling
would
be
an
exhausted
world
incapable
of
production
along
spiritual
or
artistic
lines
now
the
artist
is
always
a
child
in
the
eagerness
of
his
spirit
and
the
freshness
of
his
feeling
he
retains
the
magical
power
of
seeing
things
habitually
and
still
seeing
them
freshly
lowell

walking
with
a
friend
along
a
country
road
when
they
came
upon
a
large
building
which
bore
the
inscription

for
incurable
children
they
take

there
some
day
was
the
comment
of
a
sensitive
man
to
whom
life
brought
great
sorrows
but
who
retained
to
the
very
end
a
youthful
buoyancy
courage
and
faculty
of
finding
delight
in
common
things
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
the
greatest
men
and
women
never
lose
the
qualities
which
are
commonly
associated
with
youth

but
the
magic

the
last

of
the
most
eager
and
aspiring
men
of
his
time
genius
seems
to
be
allied
to
immortal
youth
and
in
this
alliance
resides
a
large
part
of
its
power
for
the
man
of
genius
does
not
demonstrate
his
possession
of
that
rare
and
elusive
gift
by
seeing
things
which
have
never
been
seen
before
but
by
seeing
with
fresh
interest
what
men
have
seen
so
often
that
they
have
ceased
to
regard
it
novelty
is
rarely
characteristic
of
great
works
of
art
on
the
contrary
the
facts
of
life
which
they
set
before
us
are
familiar
and
the
thoughts
they
convey
by
direct
statement
or
by
dramatic
illustration
have
always
been
haunting
our
minds
the
secret
of
the
artist
resides
in
the
unwearied
vitality
which
brings
him
to
such
close
quarters
with
life
and
endows
him
with
directness
of
sight
and
freshness
of
feeling
daisies

and

them
as
if
they
had

time

generations

seen

and
heard

but
to
wordsworth
the
song
from
the
upper
sky
and
the
notes
from
the
thicket
on
the
hill
were
full
of
the
music
of
the
first
morning
shakespeare
dealt
with
old
stories
and
constantly
touched
upon
the
most
familiar
things
but
with
what
new
interest
he
invests
both
theme
and
illustration
one
may
spend
a
lifetime
in
a
country
village
surrounded
by
people
who
are
apparently
entirely
uninteresting
but
if
one
has
the
eye
of
a
novelist
for
the
facts
of
life
the
power
to
divine
character
the
gift
to
catch
the
turn
of
speech
the
trick
of
voice
the
peculiarity
of
manner
what
resources
discoveries
and
diversion
are
at
hand
the
artist
never
has
to
search
for
material
it
is
always
at
hand
that
it
is
old
trite
stale
to
others
is
of
no
consequence
it
is
always
fresh
and
significant
to
him
this
freshness
of
feeling
is
not
in
any
way
dependent
on
the
character
of
the
materials
upon
which
it
plays
it
is
not
an
irresponsible
temperamental
quality
which
seeks
the
joyful
or
comic
facts
of
life
and
ignores
its
sad
and
tragic
aspects
the
zest
of
spirit
which
one
finds
in
shakespeare
for
instance
is
not
a
blind
optimism
thoughtlessly
escaping
from
the
shadows
into
the
sunshine
on
the
contrary
it
is
drawn
by
a
deep
instinct
to
study
the
most
perplexing
problems
of
character
and
to
drop
its
plummets
into
the
blackest
abysses
of
experience
literature
deals
habitually
with
the
most
sombre
side
of
the
human
lot
and
finds
its
richest
material
in
those
awful
happenings
which
invest
the
history
of
every
race
with
such
pathetic
interest
and
yet
literature
in
its
great
moments
overflows
with
vitality
zest
of
spirit
freshness
of
spirit
there
is
no
contradiction
in
all
this
for
the
vitality
which
pervades
great
art
is
not
dependent
upon
external
conditions
it
has
its
source
in
the
soul
of
the
artist
it
is
the
immortal
quality
in
the
human
spirit
playing
like
sunshine
on
the
hardest
and
most
tragic
facts
of
experience
it
often
suggests
no
explanation
of
these
facts
it
is
content
to
present
them
with
relentless
veracity
but
even
when
it
offers
no
solution
of
the
tragic
problem
the
tireless
interest
which
it
feels
the
force
with
which
it
illustrates
and
describes
the
power
of
moral
organisation
and
interpretation
which
it
reveals
carry
with
them
the
conviction
that
the
spirit
of
man
however
baffled
and
beaten
is
superior
to
all
the
accidents
of
fortune
and
indestructible
even
within
the
circle
of
the
blackest
fate
as
oedipus
old
blind
and
smitten
vanishes
from
our
sight
we
think
of
him
no
longer
as
a
great
figure
blasted
by
adverse
fate
but
as
a
great
soul
smitten
and
scourged
and
yet
still
invested
with
the
dignity
of
immortality
the
dramatist
even
when
he
throws
no
light
on
the
ultimate
solution
of
the
problem
with
which
he
is
dealing
feels
so
deeply
and
freshly
and
discloses
such
sustained
strength
that
the
vitality
with
which
the
facts
are
exhibited
and
the
question
stated
affirms
its
superiority
over
all
the
adversities
and
catastrophes
of
fortune
this
freshness
of
feeling
which
is
the
gift
of
men
and
women
of
genius
must
be
possessed
in
some
measure
by
all
who
long
to
get
the
most
out
of
life
and
to
develop
their
own
inner
resources
to
retain
zest
in
work
and
delight
in
life
we
must
keep
freshness
of
feeling
its
presence
lends
unfailing
charm
to
its
possessor
its
loss
involves
loss
of
the
deepest
personal
charm
it
is
essential
in
all
genuine
culture
because
it
sustains
that
interest
in
events
experience
and
opportunity
upon
which
growth
is
largely
conditioned
and
there
is
no
more
effective
means
of
preserving
and
developing
it
than
intimacy
with
those
who
have
invested
all
life
with
its
charm
the
great
books
are
reservoirs
of
this
vitality
when
our
own
interest
begins
to
die
and
the
world
turns
gray
and
old
in
our
sight
we
have
only
to
open
homer
shakespeare
browning
and
the
flowers
bloom
again
and
the
skies
are
blue
and
the
experiences
of
life
however
tragic
are
matched
by
a
vitality
which
is
sovereign

liberation
from
one
time
the
law
of
opposites
under
which
men
live
is
very
strikingly
brought
out
in
the
endeavour
to
secure
a
sound
and
intelligent
adjustment
to
one
time
a
relation
intimate
and
vital
and
at
the
same
time
deliberately
and
judicially
assumed
to
be
detached
in
thought
feeling
or
action
from
the
age
in
which
one
lives
is
to
cut
the
ties
that
bind
the
individual
to
society
and
through
which
he
is
very
largely
nourished
and
educated
to
live
deeply
and
really
through
every
form
of
expression
and
in
every
relationship
is
so
essential
to
the
complete
unfolding
of
the
personality
that
he
who
falls
below
the
full
measure
of
his
capacity
for
experience
and
for
expression
falls
below
the
full
measure
of
his
possible
growth
life
is
not
as
some
men
of
detached
moods
or
purely
critical
temper
have
assumed
a
spectacle
of
which
the
secret
can
be
mastered
without
sharing
in
the
movement
it
is
rather
a
drama
the
splendour
of
whose
expression
and
the
depth
of
whose
meaning
are
revealed
to
those
alone
who
share
in
the
action
to
stand
aside
from
the
vital
movement
and
study
life
in
a
purely
critical
spirit
is
to
miss
the
deeper
education
which
is
involved
in
the
vital
process
and
to
lose
the
fundamental
revelation
which
is
slowly
and
painfully
disclosed
to
those
whose
minds
and
hearts
are
open
to
receive
it
no
one
can
understand
love
who
has
not
loved
and
been
loved
no
one
can
comprehend
sorrow
who
has
not
had
the
companionship
of
sorrow
the
experiment
has
been
made
in
many
forms
but
no
one
has
yet
been
nourished
by
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
who
has
eaten
of
that
fruit
alone
in
the
art
of
living
as
in
all
the
arts
which
illustrate
and
enrich
living
the
amateur
and
the
dilettante
have
no
real
position
they
never
attain
to
that
mastery
of
knowledge
or
of
execution
which
alone
give
reality
to
a
man
life
or
work
mastery
in
any
art
comes
to
those
only
who
give
themselves
without
reservation
or
stint
to
their
task
mastery
in
the
supreme
art
of
living
is
within
reach
of
those
only
who
live
completely
in
every
faculty
and
relation
to
stand
in
the
closest
and
most
vital
relation
to
one
time
is
therefore
the
first
condition
of
comprehending
one
age
and
getting
from
it
what
it
has
to
give
but
while
a
man
must
be
in
and
with
his
time
in
the
most
vital
sense
he
must
not
be
wholly
of
it
to
get
the
vital
enrichment
which
flows
from
identification
with
one
age
and
at
the
same
time
to
get
the
detachment
which
enables
one
to
see
his
time
in
true
relation
to
all
time
is
one
of
the
problems
which
requires
the
highest
wisdom
for
its
solution
it
is
easy
to
become
entirely
absorbed
in
one
age
or
it
is
easy
to
detach
one
self
from
it
and
study
it
in
a
cold
and
critical
temper
but
to
get
its
warmth
and
vitality
and
escape
its
narrowing
and
limiting
influence
is
so
difficult
that
comparatively
few
men
succeed
in
striking
the
balance
between
two
divergent
tendencies
a
man
gets
power
and
knowledge
from
his
time
in
the
degree
in
which
he
suffers
it
to
enlarge
and
vitalise
him
he
loses
power
and
knowledge
in
the
degree
in
which
he
suffers
it
to
limit
his
vision
and
confine
his
interests
the
time
spirit
is
the
greatest
of
our
teachers
so
long
as
it
is
the
interpreter
of
the
eternal
spirit
it
is
the
most
fallible
and
misleading
of
teachers
when
it
attempts
to
speak
for
itself
the
visible
and
material
things
by
which
we
are
surrounded
are
of
immense
helpfulness
so
long
as
they
symbolise
invisible
and
spiritual
things
they
become
stones
of
stumbling
and
rocks
of
offence
when
they
are
detached
from
the
spiritual
order
and
set
apart
in
an
order
of
their
own
the
age
in
which
we
live
affords
a
concrete
illustration
of
the
vital
processes
in
society
and
means
of
contact
with
that
society
but
it
is
comprehensible
and
educative
in
the
exact
degree
in
which
we
understand
its
relation
to
other
times
the
impression
which
the
day
makes
upon
us
needs
to
be
tested
by
the
impression
which
we
receive
from
the
year
the
judgment
of
a
decade
must
be
corrected
by
the
judgment
of
the
century
the
present
hour
is
subtly
illusive
it
fills
the
whole
stage
to
the
exclusion
of
the
past
and
the
present
it
appears
to
stand
alone
detached
from
all
that
went
before
or
is
to
follow
it
seems
to
be
the
historic
moment
the
one
reality
amid
fleeting
shadows
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
logical
product
of
the
past
bound
to
it
by
ties
so
elusive
that
we
can
not
trace
them
and
so
numerous
and
tenacious
that
we
can
not
sever
them
it
is
but
a
fragment
of
a
whole
immeasurably
greater
than
itself
its
character
is
so
completely
determined
by
the
past
that
the
most
radical
changes
we
can
make
in
it
are
essentially
superficial
for
it
is
the
future
not
the
present
which
is
in
our
hands
to
get
even
a
glimpse
of
the
character
and
meaning
of
our
own
time
we
must
therefore
see
it
in
relation
to
all
time
to
master
it
in
any
sense
we
must
set
it
in
its
true
historical
relations
that
which
to
the
uneducated
mind
seems
portentous
is
lightly
regarded
by
the
mind
which
sees
the
apparently
isolated
event
in
a
true
historic
perspective
while
the
occurrence
or
condition
which
is
barely
noticed
by
the
untrained
seen
in
the
same
perspective
becomes
tragic
in
its
prophecy
of
change
and
suffering
history
is
full
of
corrections
of
the
mistaken
judgments
of
the
hour
and
from
the
hate
or
adoration
of
contemporaries
the
wise
man
turns
to
the
and
inexorable
judgment
of
posterity
in
the
vision
of
a
trained
intelligence
the
hour
is
never
detached
from
the
day
nor
the
day
from
the
year
and
the
year
is
always
held
in
its
place
in
the
century
now
the
man
of
culture
has
the
gift
of
living
deeply
in
his
own
age
and
at
the
same
time
of
seeing
it
in
relation
to
all
ages
it
has
no
illusion
for
him
it
can
not
deceive
him
with
its
passionate
acceptance
or
its
equally
passionate
rejection
he
sees
the
crown
shining
above
the
cross
he
hears
the
long
thunders
of
applause
breaking
in
upon
execrations
which
they
will
finally
silence
he
foresees
the
harvest
in
the
seed
that
lies
barely
covered
on
the
surface
and
afar
off
his
ear
notes
the
final
crash
of
that
which
at
the
moment
seems
to
carry
with
it
the
assurance
of
eternal
duration
such
a
man
secures
the
vitality
of
his
time
but
he
escapes
its
limitation
of
vision
by
seeing
it
clearly
and
seeing
it
whole
he
corrects
the
teaching
of
the
time
spirit
by
constant
reference
to
the
teaching
of
the
eternal
spirit
imparted
in
the
long
training
and
the
wide
revelation
of
history
the
day
is
beautiful
and
significant
or
ominous
and
tragic
to
him
as
it
discloses
its
relation
to
the
good
or
the
evil
of
the
years
that
are
gone
and
these
vital
associations
these
deep
historic
connections
are
brought
to
light
with
peculiar
clearness
in
literature
beyond
all
other
means
of
enfranchisement
the
book
liberates
a
man
from
imprisonment
within
the
narrow
limits
of
his
own
time
it
makes
him
free
of
all
times
he
lives
in
all
periods
under
all
forms
of
government
in
all
social
conditions
the
mind
of
antiquity
of
mediævalism
of
the
renaissance
is
as
open
to
him
as
the
mind
of
his
own
day
and
so
he
is
able
to
look
upon
human
life
in
its
entirety
chapter
xvii
liberation
from
one
place
the
instinct
which
drives
men
to
travel
is
at
bottom
identical
with
that
which
fills
men
with
passionate
desire
to
know
what
is
in
life
time
and
strength
are
often
wasted
in
restless
change
from
place
to
place
but
real
wandering
however
aimless
in
mood
is
always
education
to
know
one
neighbours
and
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
community
in
which
one
lives
are
the
beginning
of
sound
relations
to
the
world
at
large
but
one
never
knows
his
village
in
any
real
sense
until
he
knows
the
world
the
distant
hills
which
seem
to
be
always
calling
the
imaginative
boy
away
from
the
familiar
fields
and
hearth
do
not
conspire
against
his
peace
however
much
they
may
conspire
against
his
comfort
they
help
him
to
the
fulfilment
of
his
destiny
by
suggesting
to
his
imagination
the
deeper
experience
the
richer
growth
the
higher
tasks
which
await
him
in
the
world
beyond
the
horizon
man
is
a
wanderer
by
the
law
of
his
life
and
if
he
never
leaves
his
home
in
which
he
is
born
he
never
builds
a
home
of
his
own
it
is
the
law
of
life
that
a
child
should
leave
his
father
and
separate
himself
from
his
inherited
surroundings
in
order
that
by
and
he
may
substitute
a
conscious
for
an
unconscious
a
moral
for
an
instinctive
relation
the
instinct
of
the
was
sound
when
it
led
them
to
attach
such
importance
to
the
wandering
and
the
return
the
separation
effected
in
order
that
individuality
and
character
might
be
realised
through
isolation
and
experience
the
return
voluntarily
made
through
clear
recognition
of
the
soundness
of
the
primitive
relations
the
beauty
of
the
service
of
the
older
and
wiser
to
the
younger
and
the
more
ignorant
we
are
born
into
relations
which
we
accept
as
normal
and
inevitable
we
break
away
from
them
in
order
that
by
detachment
we
may
see
them
objectively
and
from
a
distance
and
that
we
may
come
to
we
resume
these
relations
of
deliberate
purpose
and
with
clear
perception
of
their
moral
significance
so
the
boy
grown
to
manhood
returns
to
his
home
from
the
world
in
which
he
has
tested
himself
and
seen
for
the
first
time
with
clear
eyes
the
depth
and
beauty
of
its
service
in
the
spiritual
order
so
the
man
who
has
revolted
from
the
barren
and
shallow
dogmatic
statement
of
a
spiritual
truth
returns
in
riper
years
and
with
a
deeper
insight
to
the
truth
which
is
no
longer
matter
of
inherited
belief
but
of
vital
need
and
perception
the
ripe
mature
full
mind
not
only
escapes
the
limitation
of
the
time
in
which
it
finds
itself
it
also
escapes
from
the
limitations
of
the
place
in
which
it
happens
to
be
a
man
of
deep
culture
can
not
be
a
provincial
he
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
world
the
man
of
provincial
tastes
and
ideas
owns
the
acres
the
man
of
culture
commands
the
landscape
he
knows
the
world
beyond
the
hills
he
sees
the
great
movement
of
life
from
which
the
village
seems
almost
shut
out
he
shares
those
inclusive
experiences
which
come
to
each
age
and
give
each
age
a
character
of
its
own
he
is
in
fellowship
and
sympathy
with
the
smaller
community
at
his
doors
but
he
belongs
also
to
that
greater
community
which
is
coterminous
with
humanity
itself
he
is
not
disloyal
to
his
immediate
surroundings
when
he
leaves
them
for
exploration
travel
and
discovery
he
is
fulfilling
that
law
of
life
which
conditions
true
valuation
of
that
into
which
one
is
born
upon
clear
perception
of
that
which
one
must
acquire
for
himself
the
wanderings
of
individuals
and
races
which
form
so
large
a
part
of
the
substance
of
history
are
witnesses
of
that
craving
for
deeper
experience
and
wider
knowledge
which
is
one
of
the
springs
of
human
progress
the
american
cares
for
europe
not
for
its
more
skilful
and
elaborate
ministration
to
his
comfort
he
is
drawn
towards
it
through
the
appeal
of
its
rich
historic
life
to
his
imagination
and
through
the
diversity
and
variety
of
its
social
and
racial
phenomena
and
in
like
manner
the
european
seeks
the
east
not
simply
as
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
but
because
he
finds
in
the
east
conditions
which
are
set
in
such
sharp
contrast
with
those
with
which
he
is
familiar
the
instinct
for
expansion
which
gives
human
history
its
meaning
and
interest
is
constantly
urging
the
man
of
sensitive
mind
to
secure
by
observation
that
which
he
can
not
get
by
experience
to
secure
the
most
complete
development
one
must
live
in
one
time
and
yet
live
above
it
and
one
must
also
live
in
one
home
and
yet
live
at
the
same
time
in
the
world
the
life
which
is
bounded
in
knowledge
interest
and
activity
by
the
invisible
but
real
and
limiting
walls
of
a
small
community
is
often
definite
in
aim
effective
in
action
and
upright
in
intention
but
it
can
not
be
rich
varied
generous
and
stimulating
the
life
on
the
other
hand
which
is
entirely
detached
from
local
associations
and
tasks
is
often
interesting
liberalising
and
catholic
in
spirit
but
it
can
not
be
original
or
productive
a
sound
life
balanced
poised
and
intelligently
directed
must
stand
strongly
in
both
local
and
universal
relations
it
must
have
the
vitality
and
warmth
of
the
first
and
the
breadth
and
range
of
the
second
this
liberation
from
provincialism
is
not
only
one
of
the
signs
of
culture
but
it
is
also
one
of
its
finest
results
it
registers
a
high
degree
of
advancement
for
the
man
who
has
passed
beyond
the
prejudices
misconceptions
and
narrowness
of
provincialism
has
gone
far
on
the
road
to
he
has
made
as
marked
an
advance
on
the
position
of
the
great
mass
of
his
contemporaries
as
that
position
is
an
advance
on
the
earlier
stages
of
barbarism
the
barbarian
lives
only
in
his
tribe
the
civilised

in
the
exact
degree
in
which
he
is
civilised
lives
with
humanity
books
are
among
the
richest
resources
against
narrowing
local
influences
they
are
the
ripest
expositions
of
the
to
know
the
typical
books
of
the
race
is
to
be
in
touch
with
those
elements
of
thought
and
experience
which
are
shared
by
men
of
all
countries
without
a
knowledge
of
these
books
a
man
never
really
gets
at
the
life
of
localities
which
are
foreign
to
him
never
really
sees
those
historic
places
about
which
the
traditions
of
civilisation
have
gathered
travel
is
robbed
of
half
its
educational
value
unless
one
carries
with
him
a
knowledge
of
that
which
he
looks
at
for
the
first
time
with
his
own
eyes
no
american
sees

he
carries
england
in
his
memory
and
imagination
westminster
abbey
is
devoid
of
spiritual
significance
to
the
man
who
is
ignorant
of
the
life
out
of
which
it
grew
and
of
the
history
which
is
written
in
its
architecture
and
its
memorials
the
emancipation
from
the
limitations
of
locality
is
greatly
aided
by
travel

it
is
accomplished
only
by
intimate
knowledge
of

the
unconscious
element
while
it
is
true
that
the
greatest
books
betray
the
most
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
time
in
which
they
are
written
and
disclose
the
impress
of
that
time
in
thought
structure
and
style
it
is
also
true
that
such
books
are
so
essentially
independent
of
contemporary
forms
and
moods
that
they
largely
escape
the
vicissitudes
which
attend
those
forms
and
moods
the
element
of
enduring
interest
in
them
outweighs
the
accidents
of
local
speech
or
provincial
knowledge
as
the
force
and
genius
of
cæsar
survive
the
armor
he
wore
and
the
language
he
spoke
a
great
book
is
a
possession
for
all
time
because
a
writer
of
the
first
rank
is
the
contemporary
of
every
generation
he
is
never
outgrown
exhausted
or
even
although
the
garments
he
wore
may
have
been
laid
aside
long
ago
in
this
permanent
quality
unchanged
by
changes
of
taste
and
form
resides
the
secret
of
that
charm
which
draws
about
the
great
poets
men
and
women
of
each
succeeding
period
eager
to
listen
to
words
which
thrilled
the
world
when
it
was
young
and
which
have
a
new
meaning
for
every
new
age
it
is
safe
to
say
that
homer
will
speak
to
men
as
long
as
language
survives
and
that
translation
will
follow
translation
to
the
end
of
time
what
robinson
said
of
the
bible
in
one
of
the
great
moments
of
modern
history
may
be
said
of
the
greater
works
of
literature
more
light
will
always
stream
from
them
indeed
many
of
them
will
not
be
understood
until
they
are
read
in
the
light
of
long
periods
of
history
for
as
the
great
books
are
interpretations
of
life
so
life
in
its
historic
revelation
is
one
continuous
commentary
on
the
greater
books
this
preponderance
of
the
permanent
over
the
accidental
or
temporary
in
books
of
this
class
is
largely
due
to
the
unconscious
element
which
plays
so
great
a
part
in
them
the
element
of
universal
experience
in
which
every
man
shares
in
the
exact
degree
in
which
in
mind
and
heart
he
approaches
greatness
it
is
idle
to
attempt
to
separate
arbitrarily
in
shakespeare
for
instance
those
elements
in
the
work
which
were
deliberately
introduced
from
those
which
went
into
it
by
the
unconscious
action
of
his
whole
nature
but
no
one
can
study
the
plays
intelligently
without
becoming
more
and
more
clearly
aware
of
those
depths
of
life
which
moved
in
the
poet
before
they
moved
in
his
work
which
enlarged
enriched
and
silently
reorganised
his
view
of
life
and
his
power
of
translating
life
out
of
individual
into
universal
terms
it
would
be
impossible
for
instance
to
write
such
a
play
as
the
tempest
by
sheer
force
of
intellect
in
the
creation
of
such
a
work
there
is
involved
beyond
literary
skill
calculation
and
deep
study
of
the
relation
of
thought
to
form
a
ripeness
of
spirit
a
clearness
of
insight
a
richness
of
imagination
which
are
so
much
part
of
the
very
soul
of
the
poet
that
he
does
not
separate
them
in
thought
and
can
not
consciously
balance
adjust
and
employ
them
they
are
quite
beyond
his
immediate
control
as
they
are
beyond
all
attempts
to
imitate
them
cleverness
may
learn
all
the
forms
and
methods
but
it
is
powerless
to
imitate
greatness
it
can
simulate
the
conscious
dexterous
side
of
greatness
but
it
can
not
simulate
the
unconscious
vital
side
the
moment
a
man
like
voltaire
attempts
to
deal
with
such
a
character
as
joan
of
arc
his
spiritual
and
artistic
limitations
become
painfully
apparent
of
cleverness
there
is
no
lack
but
of
reverence
insight
depth
of
feeling
the
affinity
of
the
great
imagination
for
the
great
nature
or
deed
there
is
no
sign
the
man
is
entirely
and
hopelessly
incapacitated
for
the
work
by
virtue
of
certain
limitations
in
his
own
nature
of
which
he
is
obviously
in
entire
ignorance
the
conscious
skill
of
voltaire
was
delicate
subtle
full
of
vitality
but
the
unconscious
side
of
his
nature
was
essentially
shallow
thin
largely
undeveloped
and
it
is
the
preponderance
of
the
unconscious
over
the
conscious
in
a
man
life
which
makes
him
great
in
himself
and
equips
him
for
work
of
the
highest
quality
no
man
can
put
his
skill
to
the
highest
use
and
give
his
knowledge
the
final
touch
of
individuality
until
both
are
so
entirely
incorporated
in
his
personality
that
they
have
become
part
of
himself
this
deepest
and
most
vital
of
all
the
processes
of
and
which
is
brought
to
such
perfection
in
men
of
the
highest
creative
power
is
the
fundamental
process
of
culture
the
chief
method
which
every
man
uses
consciously
or
unconsciously
who
brings
his
nature
to
complete
ripeness
of
quality
and
power
the
absorption
of
vital
experience
and
knowledge
which
went
on
in
shakespeare
enlarged
and
clarified
his
vision
and
insight
to
such
a
degree
that
both
became
not
only
searching
but
veracious
in
a
rare
degree
life
was
opened
to
him
on
many
sides
by
the
expansion
first
accomplished
in
himself
this
is
saying
again
what
has
been
said
so
many
times
but
can
not
be
said
too
often
that
in
order
to
give
one
work
a
touch
of
greatness
a
man
must
first
have
a
touch
of
greatness
in
his
own
nature
but
greatness
is
not
an
irresponsible
and
undirected
growth
it
is
as
definitely
conditioned
on
certain
obediences
to
intellectual
discipline
and
spiritual
law
as
is
any
kind
of
lesser
skill
conditioned
on
practice
and
work
one
of
these
conditions
is
the
development
of
the
power
to
turn
conscious
processes
of
observation
emotion
and
skill
into
unconscious
processes
to
enrich
the
nature
below
the
surface
so
to
speak
to
make
the
soil
productive
by
making
it
deep
and
rich
men
of
mere
skill
always
stop
short
of
this
final
process
of
and
always
stop
short
of
those
final
achievements
which
sum
up
and
express
all
that
has
been
known
or
felt
about
a
subject
and
give
it
permanent
form
men
of
essential
greatness
take
this
last
step
in
that
higher
education
which
makes
one
master
of
the
force
of
his
personality
and
give
his
words
and
works
universal
range
and
perennial
interest
now
this
is
the
deepest
quality
in
the
books
of
life
which
a
student
may
not
only
enjoy
to
the
full
but
may
also
absorb
and
make
his
own
when
alfred
de
musset
in
an
phrase
said
that
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
life
to
make
a
little
art
he
was
not
only
affirming
the
reality
of
this
process
of
passing
experience
through
consciousness
into
the
unconscious
side
of
a
man
nature
but
he
was
also
hinting
at
one
of
the
greatest
resources
of
pleasure
and
growth
for
time
and
life
continually
enrich
the
man
who
has
learned
the
secret
of
turning
experience
and
observation
into
knowledge
and
power
it
is
a
secret
in
the
sense
in
which
every
vital
process
is
a
secret
but
it
is
not
a
trick
a
skill
or
a
method
which
may
be
communicated
in
a
formula
ward
describes
a
character
in
one
of
her
stories
as
having
passed
through
a
great
culture
into
a
great
simplicity
of
nature
in
other
words
culture
had
wrought
its
perfect
work
and
the
man
had
passed
through
wide
and
intensely
activity
into
the
repose
and
simplicity
of
his
knowledge
had
become
so
completely
a
part
of
himself
that
he
had
ceased
to
be
conscious
of
it
as
a
thing
distinct
from
himself
there
is
no
easy
road
to
this
last
height
in
the
long
and
painful
process
of
education
and
time
is
an
essential
element
in
the
process
because
it
is
a
matter
of
growth
there
are
it
is
true
a
few
men
and
women
who
seem
born
with
this
power
of
living
in
the
heart
of
things
and
possessing
them
in
the
imagination
without
having
gone
through
the
long
and
painful
stages
of
preparatory
education
but
genius
is
not
only
inexplicable
it
is
also
so
rare
that
for
the
immense
majority
of
men
any
effort
to
comprehend
it
must
be
purely
academic
it
is
enough
to
know
that
if
we
are
in
any
degree
to
share
with
men
and
women
of
genius
the
faculty
of
vision
insight
and
creative
energy
we
must
master
the
conditions
which
favor
the
development
of
those
supreme
gifts
there
is
laid
therefore
upon
the
student
who
wishes
to
get
the
vital
quality
of
literature
the
necessity
of
repeating
by
deliberate
and
intelligent
design
the
process
which
in
so
many
of
the
masters
of
the
arts
has
been
apparently
accomplished
instinctively
to
make
observation

and
experience
part
of
one
spiritual
and
intellectual
capital
it
is
in
the
first
place
necessary
to
saturate
one
self
with
that
which
one
is
studying
to
possess
it
by
constant
familiarity
to
let
the
imagination
play
upon
it
to
meditate
upon
it
and
it
is
necessary
in
the
second
place
to
make
this
practice
habitual
when
it
becomes
habitual
it
will
become
largely
unconscious
one
does
it
by
instinct
rather
than
by
deliberation
this
process
is
illustrated
in
every
successful
attempt
to
master
any
art
in
the
art
of
speaking
for
instance
the
beginner
is
hampered
by
an
embarrassing
consciousness
of
his
hands
feet
speech
he
can
not
forget
himself
and
surrender
himself
to
his
thought
or
his
emotion
he
dare
not
trust
himself
he
must
therefore
train
himself
through
mind
voice
and
body
he
must
submit
to
constant
and
practice
thinking
out
point
by
point
what
he
shall
say
and
how
he
shall
say
it
this
process
is
at
the
start
partly
mechanical
in
the
nature
of
things
it
must
be
entirely
within
the
view
and
control
of
a
vigilant
consciousness
but
as
the
training
progresses
the
element
of
steadily
diminishes
until
in
great
moments
the
true
orator
become
one
harmonious
instrument
of

surrenders
himself
to
his
theme
and
his
personality
shines
clear
and
luminous
through

of
the

chapter

the
teaching
of
tragedy
no
characters
appeal
more
powerfully
to
the
imagination
than
those
impressive
figures
about
whom
the
literature
of
tragedy
moves
figures
associated
with
the
greatest
passions
and
the
most
appalling
sorrows
the
man
who
rises
step
by
step
through
discipline
and
work
to
the
highest
place
of
influence
and
power
is
applauded
and
admired
but
the
heart
of
the
world
goes
out
to
those
who
like
oedipus
are
overmatched
by
a
fate
which
pursues
with
relentless
step
or
like
hamlet
are
overweighted
with
tasks
too
heavy
or
too
terrible
for
them
agamemnon
oedipus
orestes
hamlet
lear
père
goriot
are
supreme
figures
in
that
world
of
the
imagination
in
which
the
poets
have
endeavoured
both
to
reflect
and
to
interpret
the
world
as
men
see
it
and
act
in
it
the
essence
of
tragedy
is
the
collision
between
the
individual
will
impulse
or
action
and
society
in
some
form
of
its
organisation
or
those
unwritten
laws
of
life
which
we
call
the
laws
of
god
the
tragic
character
is
always
a
lawbreaker
but
not
always
a
criminal
he
is
indeed
often
the
servant
of
a
new
idea
which
sets
him
as
in
the
case
of
giordano
bruno
in
opposition
to
an
established
order
of
knowledge
he
is
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
socrates
a
teacher
of
truths
which
make
him
a
menace
to
lower
conceptions
of
citizenship
and
narrower
ideas
of
personal
life
or
he
is
as
in
the
case
of
othello
and
paolo
the
victim
of
passions
which
overpower
the
will
and
throw
the
whole
life
out
of
relation
to
its
moral
and
social
environment
the
interest
with
which
the
tragic
character
is
always
invested
is
due
not
only
to
the
exceptional
experience
in
which
the
tragic
situation
always
culminates
but
also
to
the
which
precedes
the
penalty
and
the
expiation
there
is
a
fallacy
at
the
bottom
of
the
admiration
we
feel
when
a
rich
nature
throws
restraint
of
any
kind
to
the
winds
and
gives
itself
up
wholly
to
some
impulse
or
passion
the
fallacy
of
supposing
that
by
a
violent
break
with
existing
conditions
freedom
can
be
secured
for
the
world
loves
freedom
even
when
it
is
too
slothful
or
too
cowardly
to
pay
the
price
which
it
exacts
that
admiration
arises
however
from
a
sound
instinct
the
instinct
which
makes
us
love
both
power
and
even
when
the
first
is
and
the
second
wasted
the
vast
majority
of
men
are
content
to
do
their
work
quietly
and
in
obscurity
with
no
disclosure
of
originality
freshness
or
force
they
obey
law
conform
to
custom
respect
the
conventionalities
of
their
age
they
appear
to
be
lacking
in
representative
quality
they
are
apparently
the
faithful
and
uninteresting
drudges
of
society
there
are
it
is
true
a
host
of
commonplace
persons
in
every
generation
who
perform
uninteresting
tasks
in
a
mechanical
spirit
but
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
a
man
is
either
craven
or
cowardly
because
he
does
not
break
from
the
circle
in
which
he
finds
himself
and
make
a
bold
and
picturesque
rush
for
freedom
it
may
be
that
freedom
is
to
be
won
for
him
in
the
silent
and
faithful
doing
of
the
work
which
lies
next
him
it
is
certain
that
the
highest
power
and
the
noblest
freedom
are
secured
not
by
the
submission
which
fears
to
fight
but
by
that
which
accepts
the
discipline
for
the
sake
of
the
mastery
which
is
conditioned
upon
it
there
are
however
conditions
which
no
man
can
control
and
which
are
in
their
nature
essentially
tragic
and
men
and
women
who
are
involved
in
these
conditions
can
not
elude
a
fate
for
which
they
are
not
responsible
and
from
which
they
can
not
escape
this
was
true
of
many
of
the
greatest
characters
in
classical
tragedy
and
it
is
true
also
of
many
of
the
characters
in
modern
tragedy
the
world
looks
with
bated
breath
on
a
struggle
of
the
noblest
heroism
in
which
men
and
women
matched
against
overwhelming
social
forces
bear
their
part
with
sublime
and
unfaltering
courage
and
by
the
completeness
of
their
assert
their
sovereignty
even
in
the
hour
when
disaster
seems
to
crush
and
destroy
them
to
these
striking
figures
isolated
by
the
greatness
of
their
fate
the
heart
of
the
world
has
always
gone
out
as
to
the
noblest
of
its
children
solitary
in
the
possession
of
some
new
conception
of
duty
or
of
truth
separated
from
the
mass
of
their
fellows
by
that
lack
of
sympathy
which
springs
from
imperfect
comprehension
of
higher
aims
or
deeper
insight
these
sublime
strugglers
against
ignorance
prejudice
caste
and
power
become
the
heroes
and
martyrs
of
the
race
they
announce
the
advent
of
new
conceptions
of
social
order
and
individual
rights
they
incarnate
the
imperishable
soul
of
humanity
in
its
long
and
terrible
endeavour
to
bring
the
institutions
and
the
ideas
of
men
into
harmony
with
a
higher
order
of
life
the
tragic
element
has
therefore
many
aspects
sometimes
lawless
and
destructive
sometimes
and
instructive
but
its
illustration
in
literature
in
any
form
is
not
only
profoundly
interesting
but
profoundly
instructive
as
well
in
no
other
literary
form
is
the
stuff
of
which
life
is
made
wrought
into
such
commanding
figures
in
no
other
form
are
the
deeper
possibilities
of
life
brought
into
such
clear
view
in
no
other
form
are
the
fundamental
laws
of
life
disclosed
in
a
light
at
once
so
searching
and
so
beautiful
in
its
revealing
power
if
all
the
histories
were
lost
and
all
the
ethical
discussions
forgotten
the
moral
quality
of
life
and
the
tremendous
significance
of
character
would
find
adequate
illustration
in
the
great
tragedies
they
lay
bare
the
very
heart
of
man
under
all
historic
conditions
they
make
us
aware
of
the
range
of
his
experiences
they
uncover
the
depths
by
which
he
is
surrounded
they
enable
us
to
see
in
lightning
flashes
the
undiscovered
territory
which
incloses
the
little
island
on
which
we
live
they
light
up
the
mysterious
background
of
invisible
forces
against
which
we
play
our
parts
and
work
out
our
destiny
to
the
student
of
literature
who
strives
not
only
to
enjoy
but
to
comprehend
tragedy
brings
all
the
materials
for
a
deep
and
genuine
education
instead
of
a
philosophical
or
ethical
statement
of
principles
it
offers
living
illustration
of
ethical
law
as
revealed
in
the
greatest
deeds
and
the
most
heroic
experiences
it
discloses
the
secret
of
the
age
which
created
it
for
in
no
other
literary
form
are
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
a
period
so
deeply
involved
or
so
clearly
set
forth
the
very
springs
of
greek
character
are
uncovered
in
the
greek
tragedies
and
the
tremendous
forces
liberated
by
the
renaissance
are
nowhere
else
so
strikingly
brought
to
light
as
in
that
group
of
tragedies
which
were
produced
in
so
many
countries
by
so
many
men
at
the
close
of
that
momentous
epoch
when
literature
runs
mainly
to
the
tragic
form
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
spiritual
force
of
the
race
has
expressed
itself
afresh
and
that
a
race
or
a
group
of
races
has
passed
through
one
of
those
searching
experiences
which
bring
men
again
face
to
face
with
the
facts
of
life
for
the
production
of
tragedy
involves
thought
of
such
depth
insight
of
such
clearness
and
imaginative
power
of
such
quality
and
range
that
it
is
possible
on
a
great
scale
only
when
the
springs
of
passion
and
action
have
been
profoundly
stirred
the
appearance
of
tragedy
marks
therefore
those
moments
when
men
manifest
without
calculation
or
restraint
all
the
power
that
is
in
them
and
into
no
other
literary
form
is
the
vital
force
poured
so
lavishly
it
is
the
instinctive
recognition
of
this
unveiling
of
the
soul
of
man
which
gives
the
tragedy
such
impressiveness
even
when
it
is
haltingly
represented
on
the
stage
and
which
subdues
the
imagination
to
its
mood
when
the
solitary
reader
comes
under
its
spell
the
life
of
the
race
is
sacred
in
those
great
passages
which
record
its
sufferings
and
nothing
makes
us
so
aware
of
our
unity
with
our
kind
in
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
as
the
community
of
suffering
in
which
actively
or
passively
all
men
share
in
the
tragedy
the
student
of
literature
is
brought
into
the
most
intimate
relation
with
his
race
in
those
moments
when
its
deepest
experiences
are
laid
bare
he
enters
into
its
life
when
that
life
is
passing
through
its
most
momentous
passages
he
is
present
in
those
hidden
places
where
it
confesses
its
highest
hopes
reveals
its
most
terrible
passions
suffers
its
most
appalling
punishments
and
passes
on
through
anguish
and
sacrifice
to
its
new
day
of
thought
and
achievement
chapter

the
culture
element
in
fiction
one
of
the
chief
elements
in
fiction
which
make
for
culture
is
primarily
its
disclosure
of
the
elementary
types
of
character
and
experience
a
single
illustration
of
this
quality
will
suggest
its
presence
in
all
novels
of
the
first
rank
and
its
universal
interest
and
importance
the
aspirations
dreams
devotions
and
sacrifices
of
men
are
as
real
as
their
response
to
or
their
tendency
to
the
conventional
and
the
commonplace
and
they
are
in
the
long
run
a
great
deal
more
influential
they
have
wider
play
they
are
more
compelling
and
they
are
of
the
very
highest
significance
because
they
spring
out
of
that
which
is
deepest
and
most
distinctive
in
human
nature
a
host
of
men
never
give
these
higher
impulses
these
spiritual
aptitudes
and
possibilities
full
play
but
they
are
in
all
men
and
all
men
recognise
them
and
crave
an
expression
of
them
nothing
is
truer
on
the
lowest
and
most
practical
plane
than
the
old
declaration
that
men
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
they
sometimes
exist
on
bread
because
nothing
better
is
to
be
had
at
the
moment
but
they
live
only
in
the
full
and
free
play
of
all
their
activities
in
the
complete
expression
not
only
of
what
is
most
pressing
in
interest
and
importance
at
a
given
time
but
of
that
which
is
potential
and
possible
at
all
times
the
novel
of
romance
and
adventure
has
had
a
long
history
and
the
elements
of
which
it
is
compounded
are
recognisable
long
before
they
took
the
form
of
fiction
two
figures
appear
and
reappear
in
the
mythology
of
every
poetic
people
the
hero
and
the
wanderer
the
man
who
achieves
and
the
man
who
experiences
the
man
who
masters
life
by
superiority
of
soul
or
body
and
the
man
who
masters
it
by
completeness
of
knowledge
it
is
interesting
and
pathetic
to
find
how
universally
these
two
figures
held
the
attention
and
stirred
the
hearts
of
primitive
men
how
infinitely
varied
are
their
tasks
their
perils
and
their
vicissitudes
they
wear
so
many
guises
they
bear
so
many
names
they
travel
so
far
and
compass
so
much
experience
that
it
is
impossible
in
any
interpretation
of
mythology
to
escape
the
conviction
that
they
were
the
dominant
types
in
the
thought
of
the
and
these
earliest
were
not
idle
dreamers
entertaining
themselves
by
endless
manufacture
of
imaginary
incidents
conditions
and
persons
they
were
on
the
contrary
the
observers
the
students
the
scientists
of
their
period
their
endeavour
was
not
to
create
a
fiction
but
to
explain
the
world
and
themselves
their
observation
was
imperfect
and
they
made
ludicrous
mistakes
of
fact
because
they
lacked
both
knowledge
and
training
but
they
made
free
use
of
the
creative
faculty
and
there
is
consequently
a
good
deal
more
truth
in
their
daring
guesses
than
in
many
of
those
provisional
explanations
of
nature
and
ourselves
which
have
been
based
too
exclusively
on
scrutiny
of
the
obvious
fact
and
indifference
to
the
fact
which
is
not
less
a
fact
because
it
is
elusive
the
endeavoured
to
explain
the
world
but
that
was
only
of
their
endeavour
they
attempted
also
to
explain
themselves
they
discovered
the
striking
analogies
between
certain
natural
phenomena
or
processes
and
the
phenomena
and
processes
of
their
own
nature
they
discovered
the
tasks
and
wanderings
of
the
sun
and
they
perceived
the
singular
resemblance
of
these
tasks
and
wanderings
to
the
happenings
of
their
own
lives
so
the
hero
and
the
wanderer
became
subjective
as
well
as
objective
and
symbolised
what
was
deepest
and
most
universal
in
human
nature
and
human
experience
as
well
as
what
was
most
striking
in
the
external
world
when
primitive
men
looked
into
their
hearts
and
their
experience
they
found
their
deepest
hopes
longings
and
possibilities
bound
up
and
worked
out
in
two
careers
the
career
of
the
hero
and
the
career
of
the
wanderer
these
two
figures
became
the
commanding
types
of
all
the
nobler
mythologies
because
they
symbolised
what
was
best
deepest
and
most
real
in
human
nature
and
life
they
represent
the
possible
reach
and
the
occasional
achievement
of
the
human
soul
they
stand
for
that
which
is
potential
as
well
as
for
that
which
is
actual
in
human
experience
few
men
achieve
or
experience
on
a
great
scale
but
these
few
are
typical
and
are
therefore
transcendent
in
interest
the
average
commonplace
man
fills
great
space
in
contemporary
history
as
in
the
history
of
all
times
and
his
character
and
career
are
well
worth
the
closest
study
and
the
finest
art
of
the
writer
but
the
average
man
who
never
achieves
greatly
and
to
whom
no
striking
or
dramatic
experience
comes
has
all
the
possibilities
of
action
and
suffering
in
his
nature
and
is
profoundly
interested
in
these
more
impressive
aspects
of
life
truth
to
fact
is
essential
to
all
sound
art
but
absolute
veracity
involves
the
whole
truth
the
truth
of
the
exceptional
as
well
as
of
the
average
experience
the
truth
of
the
imagination
as
well
as
of
observation
the
hero
and
the
wanderer
are
still
and
always
will
be
the
great
human
types
and
they
are
therefore
the
types
which
will
continue
to
dominate
fiction
disappearing
at
times
from
the
stage
which
they
may
have
occupied
too
exclusively
but
always
reappearing
in
due
season
the
hero
in
the
novel
of
romance
the
wanderer
in
the
novel
of
adventure
these
figures
are
as
constant
in
fiction
as
they
were
in
mythology
from
the
days
of
the
earliest
greek
and
oriental
stories
to
these
days
of
stevenson
and
barrie
they
have
never
lost
their
hold
on
the
imagination
of
the
race
when
the
sense
of
reality
was
feeble
these
figures
became
fantastic
and
even
ridiculous
but
this
false
art
was
the
product
of
an
unregulated
not
of
an

culture
through

it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
the
four
men
who
have
been
accepted
as
the
greatest
writers
who
have
yet
appeared
used
either
the
epic
or
the
dramatic
form
it
can
hardly
have
been
accidental
that
homer
and
dante
gave
their
greatest
work
the
epic
form
and
that
shakespeare
and
goethe
were
in
their
most
fortunate
moments
dramatists
there
must
have
been
some
reason
in
the
nature
of
things
for
this
choice
of
two
literary
forms
which
differing
widely
in
other
respects
have
this
in
common
that
they
represent
life
in
action
they
are
very
largely
objective
they
portray
events
conditions
and
deeds
which
have
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
thought
and
have
involved
the
thinker
in
the
actual
historical
world
of
vital
relationships
and

the
lyric
poet
may
sing
if
it
pleases
him
like
a
bird
in
the
recesses
of
a

far
from
the
noise
and
dust
of
the
highway
and
the
clamour
of
men
in
the
competitions
of
trade
and
work
but
the
epic
or
dramatic
poet
must
find
his
theme
and
his
inspiration
in
the
stir
and
movement
of
men
in
social
relations
he
deals
not
with
the
subjective
but
with
the
objective
man
with
the
man
whose
dreams
are
no
longer
visions
of
the
imagination
but
are
becoming
incorporate
in
some
external
order
whose
passions
are
no
longer
seething
within
him
but
are
working
themselves
out
in
vital
consequences
whose
thought
is
no
longer
purely
speculative
but
has
begun
to
give
form
and
shape
to
laws
habits
or
institutions
it
is
the
revelation
of
the
human
spirit
in
action
which
we
find
in
the
epic
and
the
drama
the
inward
life
working
itself
out
in
material
and
social
relations
the
soul
of
the
man
becoming
so
to
speak
externalised
the
epic
as
illustrated
in
the
iliad
and
odyssey
deals
with
a
main
or
central
movement
in
greek
tradition
a
series
of
events
which
by
reason
of
their
nature
and
prominence
imbedded
themselves
in
the
memory
of
the
greek
race
these
events
are
described
in
narrative
form
with
episodes
incidents
and
dialogues
which
break
the
long
story
and
relax
the
strain
of
attention
from
time
to
time
without
interrupting
the
progress
of
the
narrative
there
are
heroes
whose
figures
stand
out
in
the
long
story
with
great
distinctness
but
we
are
interested
much
more
in
what
they
do
than
in
what
they
are
for
in
the
epic
character
is
subordinate
to
action
in
the
dramas
of
shakespeare
on
the
other
hand
while
action
is
more
constantly
employed
and
is
thrown
into
bolder
relief
our
deepest
interest
centres
in
the
actors
the
action
is
no
longer
the
matter
of
first
importance
it
is
significant
mainly
because
it
involves
men
and
women
not
only
in
the
chain
of
external
consequences
but
also
in
the
order
of
spiritual
sequences
we
are
deeply
stirred
by
our
perception
of
the
intimate
connection
between
the
possibilities
which
lie
sleeping
in
the
individual
life
and
the
tragic
events
which
are
set
in
motion
when
those
possibilities
are
realised
in
action
in
both
epic
and
drama
men
are
seen
not
in
their
subjective
moods
but
in
their
objective
struggles
not
in
the
detachment
of
the
life
of
speculation
and
imagination
but
in
vital
association
and
relation
with
society
in
its
order
and
institutions
with
many
differences
both
of
spirit
and
form
the
epic
and
the
drama
are
at
one
in
portraying
men
in
that
ultimate
and
decisive
stage
which
determines
individual
character
and
gives
history
its
direction
and
significance
and
it
is
from
men
in
action
that
much
of
the
deepest
truth
concerning
life
and
character
has
come
indeed
it
is
not
until
we
pass
out
of
the
region
of
the
speculative
the
merely
potential
that
the
word
character
takes
on
that
tremendous
meaning
with
which
thousands
of
years
of
actual
happenings
have
invested
it
a
purely
ideal
world
a
world
fashioned
wholly
apart
from
the
realities
which
convey
definite
concrete
revelations
of
what
is
in
us
and
in
our
world
would
necessarily
be
an
unmoral
world
the
relationships
which
bind
men
together
and
give
human
intercourse
such
depth
and
richness
spring
into
being
only
when
they
are
actually
entered
upon
they
could
never
be
understood
or
foreseen
in
a
world
of
pure
thought
nor
would
it
be
possible
in
such
a
world
to
realise
that
reaction
of
the
deed
upon
the
doer
which
creates
character
nor
that
influence
of
the
deed
upon
society
and
the
sequence
of
events
which
so
often
issues
in
tragedy
and
from
which
history
derives
its
immense
interest
and
meaning
a
world
which
stopped
short
of
realisation
in
action
would
not
only
lose
the
fathomless
dramatic
interest
which
inheres
in
human
life
but
it
would
part
with
all
those
moral
implications
of
the
integrity
and
persistence
of
the
individual
soul
its
moral
quality
and
its
moral
responsibility
which
make
man
something
different
from
the
dust
which
whirls
about
him
on
the
highway
or
the
stone
over
which
he
stumbles
this
is
precisely
the
character
of
those
speculative
systems
which
deny
the
reality
of
action
and
substitute
the
idea
for
the
deed
such
a
world
does
more
than
suffocate
the
individual
soul
it
destroys
the
very
meaning
of
life
by
robbing
it
of
moral
order
and
meaning
the
end
of
such
a
conception
of
the
universe
is
necessarily
annihilation
and
its
mood
is
necessarily
despair
how
can
a
man
come
to
know
himself
asked
goethe
never
by
thinking
but
by
doing
now
this
knowledge
of
self
in
the
large
sense
is
precisely
the
knowledge
which
ripens
and
clarifies
us
which
gives
us
sanity
repose
and
power
to
know
what
is
in
humanity
and
what
life
means
to

we
must
study
humanity
in
its
active
not
in
its
passive
moods
in
the
hours
when
it
is
doing

all
those

abstinence

would
cut
the

are

analysis

really
live
only
as
they

and
action
they
get
at
the
deepest
truth
and
enter
into
the
deepest
relationships
only
as
they
act
inaction
involves
something
more
than
the
disease
and
decay
of
certain
faculties
it
involves
the
deformity
of
arrested
development
and
failure
to
enter
into
that
larger
world
of
truth
which
is
open
to
those
races
alone
which
live
a
whole
life
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
drama
must
always
hold
the
first
place
among
those
forms
which
the
art
of
literature
has
perfected
it
is
for
this
reason
that
homer
dante
shakespeare
and
goethe
consciously
or
unconsciously
chose
those
forms
of
expression
which
are
specially
adapted
to
represent
and
illustrate
life
in
action
it
is
for
this
reason
among
others
that
these
writers
must
always
play
so
great
a
part
in
the
work
of
educating
the
race
culture
is
above
all
things
real
and
vital
knowledge
may
deal
with
abstractions
and
unrelated
bits
of
fact
but
culture
must
always
fasten
upon
those
things
which
are
significant
in
a
spiritual
order
it
has
to
do
with
the
knowledge
which
may
become
incorporate
in
a
man
nature
and
with
that
knowledge
especially
which
has
come
to
humanity
through
action
it
is
this
deeper
knowledge
which
holds
a
lighted
torch
aloft
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
soul
or
over
those
abysses
of
possible
experience
which
open
on
all
sides
about
every
man
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
pages
of
homer
dante
shakespeare
and
goethe
and
of
all
those
great
artists
who
have
seen
men
in
those
decisive
and
significant
moments
when
they
strike
into
the
movement
of
history

their
deeds

chapter

the
interpretation
of
idealism
idealism
has
so
often
been
associated
in
recent
years
with
vagueness
of
thought
slovenly
construction
and
a
weak
sentimentalism
that
it
has
been
discredited
even
among
those
who
have
recognised
the
reality
behind
it
and
the
great
place
it
must
hold
in
all
rich
and
noble
living
it
is
the
misfortune
of
what
is
called
idealism
that
like
other
spiritual
principles
it
attracts
those
who
mistake
the
longings
of
unintelligent
discontent
for
aspiration
or
the
changing
outlines
of
vapory
fancies
for
the
firm
and
consistent
form
and
shape
of
real
conceptions
deeply
realised
in
the
imagination
idealism
has
suffered
much
at
the
hands
of
feeble
practitioners
who
have
substituted
irrational
dreams
for
those
visions
and
those
penetrating
insights
which
are
characteristic
of
its
true
use
and
illustration
in
the
arts
the
height
of
the
reaction
so
vigorously
and
impressively
illustrated
in
a
great
group
of
modern
realistic
works
is
due
largely
to
the
weakness
and
extravagance
of
the
idealistic
movement
when
sentiment
is
exchanged
for
its
corrupting
counterfeit
sentimentalism
and
clear
and
definite
thinking
gives
place
to
vague
and
elusive
emotions
and
fancies
reaction
is
not
only
inevitable
but
wholesome
the
instinct
for
sanity
in
men
will
always
prevent
them
from
becoming
mere
dreamers
and
the
true
idealist
has
his
feet
firmly
planted
on
reality
and
his
idealism
discloses
itself
not
in
a
disposition
to
dream
dreams
and
see
visions
but
in
the
largeness
of
a
vision
which
sees
realities
in
the
totality
of
their
relations
and
not
merely
in
their
obvious
and
superficial
relations
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
discern
in
men
nothing
more
substantial
than
that
movement
of
hopes
and
longings
which
is
so
often
mistaken
for
aspiration
it
is
equally
a
mistake
to
discern
in
men
nothing
more
enduring
and
aspiring
than
the
animal
nature
either
report
standing
by
itself
would
be
fundamentally
untrue
man
is
an
animal
but
he
is
an
animal
with
a
soul
and
the
sane
view
of
him
takes
both
body
and
soul
into
account
the
defect
of
a
good
deal
of
current
realism
lies
in
its
lack
of
veracity
it
is
essentially
untrue
and
it
is
therefore
fundamentally
unreal
the
love
of
truth
the
passion
for
the
fact
the
determination
to
follow
life
wherever
life
leads
are
noble
artistic
instincts
and
have
borne
noble
fruit
but
what
is
often
called
realism
has
suffered
quite
as
much
as
idealism
from
weak
practitioners
and
stands
quite
as
much
in
need
of
rectification
and
restatement
the
essence
of
idealism
is
the
application
of
the
imagination
to
realities
it
is
not
a
play
of
fancy
a
golden
vision
arbitrarily
projected
upon
the
clouds
and
treated
as
if
it
had
an
objective
existence
goethe
who
had
such
a
vigorous
hold
upon
the
realities
of
existence
and
who
had
also
an
artist
horror
of
mere
abstractions
touched
the
heart
of
the
matter
when
he
defined
the
ideal
as
the
completion
of
the
real
in
this
simple
but
luminous
statement
he
condensed
the
faith
and
practice
not
only
of
the
greater
artists
of
every
age
but
of
the
greater
thinkers
as
well
in
the
order
of
life
there
can
be
no
real
break
between
things
as
they
now
exist
and
things
as
they
will
exist
in
the
remotest
future
the
future
can
not
contradict
the
present
nor
falsify
it
for
the
future
must
be
the
realisation
of
the
full
possibilities
of
the
present
the
present
is
related
to
it
as
the
seed
is
related
to
the
flower
and
fruit
in
which
its
development
culminates
there
are
vast
changes
of
form
and
dimension
between
the
seed
and
the
tree
hanging
ripe
with
fruit
but
there
is
no
contradiction
between
the
germ
and
its
final
unfolding
a
rigid
realism
however
sees
in
the
seed
nothing
but
its
present
hardness
littleness
ugliness
a
true
and
rational
idealism
sees
all
these
things
but
it
sees
also
not
only
appearances
but
potentialities
or
to
recall
another
of
goethe
phrases
it
sees
the
object
whole
to
see
life
clearly
and
to
see
it
whole
is
not
only
to
see
distinctly
the
obvious
facts
of
life
but
to
see
these
facts
in
sequence
and
order
in
other
words
to
explain
and
interpret
them
the
power
to
do
this
is
one
of
the
signs
of
a
great
imagination
and
other
things
being
equal
the
rank
of
a
work
of
art
may
in
the
last
analysis
be
determined
by
the
clearness
and
veracity
with
which
explanation
and
interpretation
are
suggested
homer
is
for
this
reason
the
foremost
writer
of
the
greek
race
he
is
wholly
free
from
any
purpose
to
give
ethical
instruction
he
is
absolutely
delivered
from
the
temptation
to
didacticism
and
yet
he
reveals
to
us
the
secret
of
the
temperament
and
genius
of
his
race
and
he
does
this
because
he
sees
in
his
race
the
potentialities
of
the
seed
the
vitality
beauty
fragrance
and
growth
which
lie
enfolded
in
its
tiny
and
unpromising
substance
if
the
reality
of
a
thing
is
not
so
much
its
appearance
as
the
totality
of
that
which
is
to
issue
out
of
it
then
nothing
can
be
truly
seen
without
the
use
of
the
imagination
all
that
the
idealist
asks
is
that
life
shall
be
seen
not
only
with
his
eyes
but
with
his
imagination
his
descriptions
are
accurate
but
they
are
also
vital
they
give
us
the
thing
not
only
as
it
looked
standing
by
itself
but
as
it
appeared
in
the
complete
life
of
which
it
was
a
part
he
makes
us
see
the
physical
side
of
the
fact
with
great
distinctness
but
he
makes
us
see
its
spiritual
side
as
well
as
a
result
there
is
left
in
our
minds
by
the
intelligent
reading
of
homer
a
clear
impression
of
the
spiritual
political
and
social
aptitudes
and
characteristics
of
the
greek
people
of
his
age
an
impression
which
no
exact
report
of
mere
appearances
could
have
conveyed
an
impression
which
is
due
to
the
constant
play
of
the
poet
imagination
upon
the
facts
with
which
he
is
dealing
this
is
true
idealism
but
it
is
also
true
realism
it
is
not
only
the
fact
but
the
truth
the
fact
may
be
observed
but
the
truth
must
be
discerned
by
insight
it
is
not
within
the
range
of
mere
observation
and
it
is
this
insight
this
discernment

tolstoi
has
often
been
called
a
realist
by
those
who
are
eager
to
label
everything
and
everybody
succinctly
but
tolstoi
is
one
of
the
representative
idealists
of
his
time
and
his
master
and
man
is
one
of
the
most
touching
and
sincere
bits
of
true
idealism
which
has
been
given
the
world
for
many
a
day
there
is
nothing
which
needs
such
constant
reinforcement
as
this
faculty
of
seeing
things
in
their
totality
for
we
are
largely
at
the
mercy
of
the
hour
unless
we
invoke
the
aid
of
the
imagination
to
set
the
appearances
of
the
moment
in
their
large
relations
to
the
man
who
sees
things
as
they
rush
like
a
stream
before
him
there
is
no
order
progression
or
intelligent
movement
in
human
affairs
but
to
the
student
who
brings
to
the
study
of
current
events
wide
and
deep
knowledge
of
the
great
historic
movements
these
apparently
unrelated
phenomena
disclose
the
most
intimate
and
connections
the
most
despairing
pessimism
would
be
born
in
the
heart
of
the
man
who
should
be
fated
to
see
apart
from
yesterday
and
a
rational
and
inspiring
hope
may
be
born
in
the
soul
of
the
man
who
sees
the
day
as
part
of
the
year
and
the
year
as
part
of
the
century
the
great
writers
are
a
refuge
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
moment
because
they
set
the
events
of
life
in
a
fundamental
order
and
make
us
aware
of
the
finer
potentialities
of
our
race
they
are
idealists
in
the
breadth
of
their
vision
and
the
nobility
of
the
interpretation
of
events
which
they
offer
us
chapter
xxiii
the
vision
of
perfection
these
writers
are
also
by
virtue
of
the
faculty
of
discerning
the
interior
relations
of
appearances
and
events
the
expositors
of
that
ultimate
idealism
which
not
only
discovers
the
possibility
of
the
whole
in
the
parts
of
the
perfect
in
the
imperfect
but
which
discovers
the
whole
the
complete
and
the
perfect
and
brings
each
before
us
in
some
noble
form
the
reality
of
the
ideal
as
plato
saw
it
is
by
no
means
universally
accepted
as
a
philosophical
conclusion
but
all
men
and
women
accept
it
as
a
rule
of
life
idealism
is
wrought
into
the
very
fibre
of
the
race
and
is
as
indestructible
as
the
imagination
in
which
it
has
its
roots
deep
in
the
heart
of
humanity
lies
the
unshakable
faith
in
its
essential
divinity
and
in
the
reality
of
its
highest
hopes
of
development
and
attainment
the
failure
of
noble
schemes
the
decline
of
enthusiasms
the
fading
of
visions
and
dreams
which
seemed
to
have
the
luminous
constancy
of
fixed
stars
breed
temporary
depressions
and
passing
moods
of
scepticism
and
despair
but
the
spiritual
vitality
of
the
race
always
reasserts
itself
and
faith
returns
after
every
disaster
or
disillusion
indeed
as
the
race
grows
older
and
masters
more
and
more
a
knowledge
of
its
conditions
the
impression
of
the
essential
greatness
of
the
experience
we
call
life
deepens
in
the
finer
spirits
it
becomes
clear
that
the
end
towards
which
the
hopes
of
the
world
have
always
moved
is
farther
off
than
it
seemed
to
the
earlier
generations
that
the
process
of
spiritual
and
social
evolution
is
longer
and
more
painful
that
the
universe
is
vaster
and
more
wonderful
than
the
vision
of
it
which
formed
in
the
imagination
of
thinkers
and
poets
in
a
word
that
the
education
which
is
being
imparted
to
humanity
by
the
very
structure
of
the
conditions
under
which
it
lives
grows
more
severe
prolonged
and
exacting
as
its
methods
and
processes
become
more
clear
the
broadening
of
the
field
of
observation
has
steadily
deepened
the
impression
of
the
magnitude
and
majesty
of
the
physical
order
by
which
men
are
surrounded
and
the
fuller
knowledge
of
what
is
in
human
experience
has
steadily
deepened
the
impression
of
the
almost
tragic
greatness
of
the
lot
of
men
the
disappointments
of
the
race
have
been
largely
due
to
its
inadequate
conception
of
its
own
possibilities
its
disillusions
have
been
like
the
fading
of
the
mirage
which
simulates
against
the
near
horizon
that
which
lies
long
leagues
away
these
disappointments
and
disillusions
as
browning
saw
clearly
are
essential
parts
of
an
education
which
leads
the
race
step
by
step
from
smaller
to
larger
ideas
from
nearer
and
easier
to
more
remote
and
difficult
attainments
the
disappointment
which
comes
with
the
completion
of
every
piece
of
work
well
and
wisely
done
does
not
arise
from
the
futility
of
the
work
as
the
pessimists
tell
us
but
from
its
inadequacy
to
express
entirely
the
thought
and
force
of
the
man
who
has
striven
to
express
himself
completely
in
a
material
which
however
masterfully
used
can
never
give
its
ultimate
form
to
a
spiritual
conception
it
is
not
an
evidence
of
failure
but
a
prophecy
of
greater
achievement
a
world
in
which
the
work
was
as
great
as
the
worker
the
piece
of
art
as
the
artist
would
be
a
finished
world
in
more
senses
than
one
a
world
in
which
all
work
is
inadequate
to
contain
the
energy
of
the
worker
all
art
insufficient
to
express
the
soul
of
the
artist
is
necessarily
a
prophetic
world
bearing
witness
to
the
presence
of
a
creative
force
in
workers
and
artists
immeasurably
beyond
the
capacity
of
any
perishable
material
to
receive
or
to
preserve
a
rational
idealism
is
therefore
not
only
indestructible
in
a
race
which
does
not
violate
the
laws
of
life
but
is
instilled
into
the
higher
order
of
minds
by
the
order
of
life
as
revealed
by
science
history
and
the
arts
and
this
idealistic
tendency
is
not
only
the
poetic
temper
it
is
the
hope
and
safeguard
of
society
the
real
perils
of
the
race
are
not
material
they
are
always
spiritual
and
no
peril
could
be
greater
than
the
loss
of
faith
and
hope
in
the
possibility
of
attaining
the
best
things
if
men
are
ever
bereft
of
their
instinctive
or
rational
conviction
that
they
have
the
power
ultimately
to
bring
institutions
of
all
kinds
into
harmony
with
their
higher
conceptions
they
will
sink
into
the
lethargy
of
despair
or
the
slough
of
sensualism
the
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
ideal
in
personal
and
social
life
is
not
only
the
joy
and
inspiration
of
the
poet
and
thinker
it
is
also
the
salvation
of
the
race
it
is
imperishable
because
it
is
the
product
of
the
play
of
the
imagination
on
the
realities
of
life
and
until
the
imagination
perishes
the
vision
of
the
ultimate
perfection
will
form
and
reform
in
the
heart
of
every
generation
it
is
the
inspiration
of
every
art
the
end
of
every
noble
occupation
the
secret
hope
of
every
fine
character
idealism
in
this
sense
not
as
the
product
of
an
easy
and
ignorant
optimism
turning
away
from
the
facts
of
life
but
as
the
product
of
a
large
and
spiritual
dealing
with
those
facts
is
the
very
soul
not
only
of
noble
living
but
of
those
noble
expressions
of
life
which
the
greater
writers
have
given
us
they
disclose
wide
diversity
of
gifts
but
they
have
this
in
common
that
in
discovering
to
us
the
spiritual
order
of
the
facts
of
life
they
disclose
also
those
ideal
figures
which
the

accepts
as
embodiments
of
its

and

it
is
a
significant

chapter

retrospect
the
books
of
four
great
writers
have
been
used
almost
exclusively
by
way
of
illustration
throughout
this
discussion
of
the
relation
of
books
to
culture
this
limited
selection
may
have
seemed
at
times
too
narrow
and
rigid
it
may
have
conveyed
an
impression
of
insensibility
to
the
vast
range
and
the
great
variety
of
literary
forms
and
products
and
of
indifference
to
contemporary
writing
it
needs
to
be
said
therefore
that
the
constant
reference
to
homer
dante
shakespeare
and
goethe
has
been
made
for
the
sake
of
clearness
and
force
of
illustration
and
not
in
any
sense
as
applying
an
exclusive
principle
of
selection
the
books
of
life
are
to
be
found
in
every
language
and
are
the
product
of
almost
every
age
and
no
one
attains
genuine
culture
who
does
not
through
them
make
himself
familiar
with
the
life
of
each
successive
generation
to
be
ignorant
of
the
thought
and
art
of
one
time
involves
a
narrowness
of
intelligence
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
maturity
of
taste
and
ripeness
of
nature
which
have
been
emphasised
in
these
chapters
as
the
highest
and
finest
fruits
of
culture
the
more
generous
a
man
culture
becomes
the
more
catholic
becomes
his
taste
and
the
keener
his
insight
the
man
of
highest
intelligence
will
be
the
first
to
recognise
the
fresh
touch
the
new
point
of
view
the
broader
thought
he
will
bring
to
the
books
of
his
own
time
not
only
a
trained
instinct
for
sound
work
but
a
deep
sympathy
with
the
latest
effort
of
the
human
spirit
to
express
itself
in
new
forms
so
deep
and
real
will
be
his
feeling
for
life
that
he
will
be
eager
to
understand
and
possess
every
fresh
manifestation
of
that
life
however
novel
and
unconventional
the
new
form
may
be
it
will
not
make
its
appeal
to
him
in
vain
it
remains
true
however
that
literature
is
a
universal
art
expressive
and
interpretative
of
the
spirit
of
humanity
and
that
no
man
can
make
full
acquaintance
with
that
spirit
who
fails
to
make
companionship
with
its
greatest
masters
and
interpreters
the
appeal
of
contemporary
books
is
so
constant
and
urgent
that
it
stands
in
small
need
of
emphasis
but
the
claims
of
the
rich
and
splendid
literature
of
the
past
are
often
slighted
or
ignored
the
supreme
masters
of
an
art
ought
to
be
the
objects
of
constant
study
and
thought
there
is
more
of
life
truth
and
beauty
in
them
than
in
their
of
narrower
range
of
experience
and
artistic
achievement
for
this
reason
these
greatest
interpreters
of
the
human
spirit
are
in
no
sense
exclusively
of
the
past
they
are
of
the
present
and
the
future
to
know
them
is
not
only
to
know
the
particular
periods
in
which
they
wrote
but
to
know
our
own
period
in
the
deepest
sense
no
man
can
better
prepare
himself
to
enter
into
the
formative
life
of
his
time
than
by
thoroughly
familiarising
himself
with
the
greatest
books
of
the
past
for
in
these
are
revealed
not
the
secrets
of
past
forms
of
life
but
the
secrets
of
that
spirit
whose
historic
life
is
one
unbroken
revelation
of
its
nature
and
destiny
it
is
therefore
no
disparagement
of
the
great
company
of
writers
who
have
been
the
secretaries
of
the
race
in
all
ages
to
fasten
attention
upon
the
claims
of
the
four
men
of
genius
whom
the
world
has
accepted
as
the
supreme
masters
of
the
art
of
literature
and
to
point
out
again
the
immense
importance
of
their
works
in
the
educational
life
of
the
individual
and
of
society
it
can
not
be
said
too
often
that
literature
is
the
product
of
the
continuous
spiritual
activity
of
the
race
that
it
can
not
be
arbitrarily
divided
into
periods
save
for
mere
convenience
of
arrangement
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
and
value
its
latest
products
unless
one
is
able
to
find
their
place
and
discern
their
value
in
the
order
of
a
spiritual
development
to
secure
an
adequate
impression
of
this
highest
expression
of
the
human
spirit
one
must
keep
in
view
the
work
of
the
past
quite
as
definitely
as
the
work
of
the
present
in
such
a
broad
survey
there
is
a
constant
deliverance
from
the
rashness
of
contemporary
judgments
and
from
that
narrowness
of
feeling
which
limits
one
vital
contact
with
the
life
of
the
race
to
the
products
of
a
single
brief
period
in
any
attempt
to
indicate
the
fundamental
significance
of
the
art
of
literature
in
the
educational
development
of
the
individual
and
of
society
there
must
also
be
a
certain
repetition
of
idea
and
of
illustration
this
limitation
if
it
be
a
limitation
is
inherent
in
the
very
nature
of
the
undertaking
literature
is
for
purposes
of
comment
and
exposition
practically
inexhaustible
its
themes
are
as
varied
and
as
numerous
as
the
objects
upon
which
the
mind
can
fasten
and
about
which
the
imagination
can
play
but
while
its
forms
and
products
are
almost
without
number
this
magnificent
growth
has
in
the
last
analysis
a
single
root
and
in
these
brief
chapters
the
endeavour
has
been
made
very
inadequately
to
bring
the
mind
to
this
deep
and
hidden
unity
of
life
and
art
information
instruction
delight
flow
in
a
thousand
rivulets
from
as
many
books
but
there
is
a
spring
of
life
which
feeds
all
these
separate
streams
from
that
unseen
source
flows
the
vitality
which
has
given
power
and
freshness
to
a
host
of
noble
works
from
that
source
vitality
also
flows
into
every
mind
open
to
its
incoming
a
rich
intellectual
life
is
characterised
not
so
much
by
profusion
of
ideas
as
by
the
application
of
a
few
formative
ideas
to
life
not
so
much
by
multiplicity
of
detached
thoughts
as
by
the
habit
of
thinking
the
genius
of
carlyle
is
evidenced
not
by
prodigal
growth
of
ideas
but
by
an
impressive
interpretation
of
life
through
the
application
to
all
its
phenomena
of
a
few
ideas
of
great
depth
and
range
and
this
is
true
of
all
the
great
writers
who
have
given
us
fresh
views
of
life
from
some
central
and
commanding
height
rather
than
a
succession
of
glimpses
or
outlooks
from
a
great
number
of
points
the
closer
the
approach
to
the
central
force
behind
any
course
of
development
the
fewer
in
number
are
the
elements
involved
the
rootage
of
literature
in
the
spiritual
nature
and
experience
of
the
race
is
the
fundamental
fact
not
only
in
the
history
of
this
rich
and
splendid
art
but
in
its
relation
to
culture
from
this
rootage
flows
the
vitality
which
imparts
immortality
to
its
noblest
products
and
which
supplies
an
educational
element
unrivalled
in
its
enriching
and
enlarging
quality
