in
some
respects
a
sequel
to
the
pioneers
of

and
it
deals
with
the
lives
and
principal
achievements
of
those
distinguished

chapter
i
the
origin
of
the
telegraph
the
history
of
an
invention
whether
of
science
or
art
may
be
compared
to
the
growth
of
an
organism
such
as
a
tree
the
wind
or
the
random
visit
of
a
bee
unites
the
pollen
in
the
flower
the
green
fruit
forms
and
ripens
to
the
perfect
seed
which
on
being
planted
in
congenial
soil
takes
root
and
flourishes
even
so
from
the
chance
combination
of
two
facts
in
the
human
mind
a
crude
idea
springs
and
after
maturing
into
a
feasible
plan
is
put
in
practice
under
favourable
conditions
and
so
develops
these
processes
are
both
subject
to
a
thousand
accidents
which
are
inimical
to
their
achievement
especially
is
this
the
case
when
their
object
is
to
produce
a
novel
species
or
a
new
and
great
invention
like
the
telegraph
it
is
then
a
question
of
raising
not
one
seedling
but
many
and
modifying
these
in
the
lapse
of
time
similarly
the
telegraph
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
the
work
of
any
one
mind
but
of
many
and
during
a
long
course
of
years
because
at
length
the
final
seedling
is
obtained
are
we
to
overlook
the
antecedent
varieties
from
which
it
was
produced
and
without
which
it
could
not
have
existed
because
one
inventor
at
last
succeeds
in
putting
the
telegraph
in
operation
are
we
to
neglect
his
predecessors
whose
attempts
and
failures
were
the
steps
by
which
he
mounted
to
success
all
who
have
extended
our
knowledge
of
electricity
or
devised
a
telegraph
and
familiarised
the
public
mind
with
the
advantages
of
it
are
deserving
of
our
praise
and
gratitude
as
well
as
he
who
has
entered
into
their
labours
and
by
genius
and
perseverance
won
the
honours
of
being
the
first
to
introduce
it
let
us
therefore
trace
in
a
rapid
manner
the
history
of
the
electric
telegraph
from
the
earliest
times
the
sources
of
a
river
are
lost
in
the
clouds
of
the
mountain
but
it
is
usual
to
derive
its
waters
from
the
lakes
or
springs
which
are
its
in
the
same
way
the
origins
of
our
knowledge
of
electricity
and
magnetism
are
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
but
there
are
two
facts
which
have
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
of
the
science
it
was
known
to
the
ancients
at
least
years
before
christ
that
a
piece
of
amber
when
excited
by
rubbing
would
attract
straws
and
that
a
lump
of
lodestone
had
the
property
of
drawing
iron
both
facts
were
probably
ascertained
by
chance
humboldt
informs
us
that
he
saw
an
indian
child
of
the
orinoco
rubbing
the
seed
of
a
trailing
plant
to
make
it
attract
the
wild
cotton
and
perhaps
a
prehistoric
tribesman
of
the
baltic
or
the
plains
of
sicily
found
in
the
yellow
stone
he
had
polished
the
mysterious
power
of
collecting
dust
a
greek
legend
tells
us
that
the
lodestone
was
discovered
by
magnes
a
shepherd
who
found
his
crook
attracted
by
the
rock
however
this
may
be
we
are
told
that
thales
of
miletus
attributed
the
attractive
properties
of
the
amber
and
the
lodestone
to
a
soul
within
them
the
name
electricity
is
derived
from
elektron
the
greek
for
amber
and
magnetism
from
magnes
the
name
of
the
shepherd
or
more
likely
from
the
city
of
magnesia
in
lydia
where
the
stone
occurred
these
properties
of
amber
and
lodestone
appear
to
have
been
widely
known
the
persian
name
for
amber
is
kahruba
attractor
of
straws
and
that
for
lodestone
attractor
of
iron
in
the
old
persian
romance
the
loves
of
majnoon
and
leila
the
lover
sings
was
as
amber
and
i
but
as
straw
she
touched
me
and
i
shall
ever
cling
to
her
the
chinese
philosopher
kuopho
who
flourished
in
the
fourth
century
writes
that
attraction
of
a
magnet
for
iron
is
like
that
of
amber
for
the
smallest
grain
of
mustard
seed
it
is
like
a
breath
of
wind
which
mysteriously
penetrates
through
both
and
communicates
itself
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
lodestone
was
probably
known
in
china
before
the
christian
era
other
electrical
effects
were
also
observed
by
the
ancients
classical
writers
as
homer
caesar
and
plutarch
speak
of
flames
on
the
points
of
javelins
and
the
tips
of
masts
they
regarded
them
as
manifestations
of
the
deity
as
did
the
soldiers
of
the
mahdi
lately
in
the
soudan
it
is
recorded
of
servius
tullus
the
sixth
king
of
rome
that
his
hair
emitted
sparks
on
being
combed
and
that
sparks
came
from
the
body
of
walimer
a
gothic
chief
who
lived
in
the
year
during
the
dark
ages
the
mystical
virtues
of
the
lodestone
drew
more
attention
than
those
of
the
more
precious
amber
and
interesting
experiments
were
made
with
it
the
romans
knew
that
it
could
attract
iron
at
some
distance
through
an
intervening
fence
of
wood
brass
or
stone
one
of
their
experiments
was
to
float
a
needle
on
a
piece
of
cork
and
make
it
follow
a
lodestone
held
in
the
hand
this
arrangement
was
perhaps
copied
from
the
compass
of
the
phoenician
sailors
who
buoyed
a
lodestone
and
observed
it
set
towards
the
north
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
magnet
was
employed
by
the
priests
of
the
oracle
in
answering
questions
we
are
told
that
the
emperor
valerius
while
at
antioch
in
was
shown
a
floating
needle
which
pointed
to
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
when
guided
by
the
directive
force
of
a
lodestone
it
was
also
believed
that
this
effect
might
be
produced
although
a
stone
wall
intervened
so
that
a
person
outside
a
house
or
prison
might
convey
intelligence
to
another
inside
this
idea
was
perhaps
the
basis
of
the
sympathetic
telegraph
of
the
middle
ages
which
is
first
described
in
the
magiae
naturalis
of
john
baptista
porta
published
at
naples
in
it
was
supposed
by
porta
and
others
after
him
that
two
similar
needles
touched
by
the
same
lodestone
were
sympathetic
so
that
although
far
apart
if
both
were
freely
balanced
a
movement
of
one
was
imitated
by
the
other
by
encircling
each
balanced
needle
with
an
alphabet
the
sympathetic
telegraph
was
obtained
although
based
on
error
and
opposed
by
cabeus
and
others
this
fascinating
notion
continued
to
crop
up
even
to
the
days
of
addison
it
was
a
prophetic
shadow
of
the
coming
invention
in
the
scepsis
scientifica
published
in
joseph
glanvil
wrote
confer
at
the
distance
of
the
indies
by
sympathetic
conveyances
may
be
as
usual
to
future
times
as
to
us
in
literary
correspondence
the
rosicrucians
also
believed
that
if
two
persons
transplanted
pieces
of
their
flesh
into
each
other
and
tattooed
the
grafts
with
letters
a
sympathetic
telegraph
could
be
established
by
pricking
the
letters
gilbert
physician
to
queen
elizabeth
by
his
systematic
researches
discovered
the
magnetism
of
the
earth
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
modern
science
of
electricity
and
magnetism
otto
von
guericke
burgomaster
of
magdeburg
invented
the
electrical
machine
for
generating
large
quantities
of
the
electric
fire
stephen
gray
a
pensioner
of
the
charterhouse
conveyed
the
fire
to
a
distance
along
a
line
of
pack
thread
and
showed
that
some
bodies
conducted
electricity
while
others
insulated
it
dufay
proved
that
there
were
two
qualities
of
electricity
now
called
positive
and
negative
and
that
each
kind
repelled
the
like
but
attracted
the
unlike
von
kleist
a
cathedral
dean
of
kamm
in
pomerania
or
at
all
events
cuneus
a
burgher
and
muschenbroek
a
professor
of
leyden
discovered
the
leyden
jar
for
holding
a
charge
of
electricity
and
franklin
demonstrated
the
identity
of
electricity
and
lightning
the
charge
from
a
leyden
jar
was
frequently
sent
through
a
chain
of
persons
clasping
hands
or
a
length
of
wire
with
the
earth
as
part
of
the
circuit
this
experiment
was
made
by
joseph
franz
of
vienna
in
and
watson
of
london
in
while
franklin
ignited
spirits
by
a
spark
which
had
been
sent
across
the
schuylkill
river
by
the
same
means
but
none
of
these
men
seem
to
have
grasped
the
idea
of
employing
the
fleet
fire
as
a
telegraph
the
first
suggestion
of
an
electric
telegraph
on
record
is
that
published
by
one
in
the
scots
magazine
for
february
the
device
consisted
in
running
a
number
of
insulated
wires
between
two
places
one
for
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
the
wires
were
to
be
charged
with
electricity
from
a
machine
one
at
a
time
according
to
the
letter
it
represented
at
its
far
end
the
charged
wire
was
to
attract
a
disc
of
paper
marked
with
the
corresponding
letter
and
so
the
message
would
be
spelt
also
suggested
the
first
acoustic
telegraph
for
he
proposed
to
have
a
set
of
bells
instead
of
the
letters
each
of
a
different
tone
and
to
be
struck
by
the
spark
from
its
charged
wire
the
identity
of
who
dated
his
letter
from
renfrew
has
not
been
established
beyond
a
doubt
there
is
a
tradition
of
a
clever
man
living
in
renfrew
at
that
time
and
afterwards
in
paisley
who
could
a
room
wi
coal
reek
smoke
and
mak
lichtnin
speak
and
write
upon
the
wa
by
some
he
was
thought
to
be
a
certain
charles
marshall
from
aberdeen
but
it
seems
likelier
that
he
was
a
charles
morrison
of
greenock
who
was
trained
as
a
surgeon
and
became
connected
with
the
tobacco
trade
of
glasgow
in
renfrew
he
was
regarded
as
a
kind
of
wizard
and
he
is
said
to
have
emigrated
to
virginia
where
he
died
in
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
many
other
suggestions
of
telegraphs
based
on
the
known
properties
of
the
electric
fire
were
published
for
example
by
joseph
bozolus
a
jesuit
lecturer
of
rome
in
by
odier
a
geneva
physicist
in
who
states
in
a
letter
to
a
lady
that
he
conceived
the
idea
on
hearing
a
casual
remark
while
dining
at
sir
john
pringle
with
franklin
priestley
and
other
great
geniuses
shall
amuse
you
perhaps
in
telling
you
he
says
i
have
in
my
head
certain
experiments
by
which
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
emperor
of
mogol
or
of
china
the
english
the
french
or
any
other
people
of
europe
you
may
intercommunicate
all
that
you
wish
at
a
distance
of
four
or
five
thousands
leagues
in
less
than
half
an
hour
will
that
suffice
you
for
glory
george
louis
lesage
in
proposed
a
plan
similar
to
using
underground
wires
an
anonymous
correspondent
of
the
journal
de
paris
for
may
suggested
an
alarm
bell
to
call
attention
to
the
message
lomond
of
paris
devised
a
telegraph
with
only
one
wire
the
signals
to
be
read
by
the
peculiar
movements
of
an
attracted
and
arthur
young
witnessed
his
plan
in
action
as
recorded
in
his
diary
chappe
the
inventor
of
the
semaphore
tried
about
the
year
to
introduce
a
synchronous
electric
telegraph
and
failed
don
francisco
salva
y
campillo
of
barcelona
in
proposed
to
make
a
telegraph
between
barcelona
and
mataro
either
overhead
or
underground
and
he
remarks
of
the
wires
the
bottom
of
the
sea
their
bed
would
be
ready
made
and
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
casualty
that
should
disturb
them
in
salva
telegraph
the
signals
were
to
be
made
by
illuminating
letters
of
tinfoil
with
the
spark
volta
great
invention
of
the
pile
in
furnished
a
new
source
of
electricity
better
adapted
for
the
telegraph
and
salva
was
apparently
the
first
to
recognise
this
for
in
the
same
year
he
proposed
to
use
it
and
interpret
the
signals
by
the
twitching
of
a
frog
limb
or
the
decomposition
of
water
in
jean
alexandre
a
reputed
natural
son
of
jean
jacques
rousseau
brought
out
a
telegraphe
intime
or
secret
telegraph
which
appears
to
have
been
a
apparatus
the
inventor
concealed
its
mode
of
working
but
it
was
believed
to
be
electrical
and
there
was
a
needle
which
stopped
at
various
points
on
a
dial
alexandre
stated
that
he
had
found
out
a
strange
matter
or
power
which
was
perhaps
generally
diffused
and
formed
in
some
sort
the
soul
of
the
universe
he
endeavoured
to
bring
his
invention
under
the
eye
of
the
first
consul
but
napoleon
referred
the
matter
to
delambre
and
would
not
see
it
alexandre
was
born
at
paris
and
served
as
a
carver
and
gilder
at
poictiers
then
sang
in
the
churches
till
the
revolution
suppressed
this
means
of
livelihood
he
rose
to
influence
as
a
then
retired
from
the
army
and
became
an
inventor
his
name
is
associated
with
a
method
of
steering
balloons
and
a
filter
for
supplying
bordeaux
with
water
from
the
garonne
but
neither
of
these
plans
appear
to
have
been
put
in
practice
and
he
died
at
angouleme
leaving
his
widow
in
extreme
poverty
sommering
a
distinguished
prussian
anatomist
in
brought
out
a
telegraph
worked
by
a
voltaic
battery
and
making
signals
by
decomposing
water
two
years
later
it
was
greatly
simplified
by
schweigger
of
halle
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
but
for
the
discovery
of
by
oersted
in
the
chemical
telegraph
would
have
come
into
practical
use
in
ralph
wedgwood
submitted
a
telegraph
based
on
frictional
electricity
to
the
admiralty
but
was
told
that
the
semaphore
was
sufficient
for
the
country
in
a
pamphlet
he
suggested
the
establishment
of
a
telegraph
system
with
public
offices
in
different
centres
francis
ronalds
in
brought
a
similar
telegraph
of
his
invention
to
the
notice
of
the
admiralty
and
was
politely
informed
that
of
any
kind
are
now
wholly
unnecessary
in
harrison
gray
dyar
of
new
york
devised
a
telegraph
in
which
the
spark
was
made
to
stain
the
signals
on
moist
litmus
paper
by
decomposing
nitric
acid
but
he
had
to
abandon
his
experiments
in
long
island
and
fly
the
country
because
of
a
writ
which
charged
him
with
a
conspiracy
for
carrying
on
secret
communication
in
hubert
recy
published
an
account
of
a
system
of
teletatodydaxie
by
which
the
electric
spark
was
to
ignite
alcohol
and
indicate
the
signals
of
a
code
but
spark
or
frictional
electric
telegraphs
were
destined
to
give
way
to
those
actuated
by
the
voltaic
current
as
the
chemical
mode
of
signalling
was
superseded
by
the
in
the
separate
courses
of
electric
and
magnetic
science
were
united
by
the
connecting
discovery
of
oersted
who
found
that
a
wire
conveying
a
current
had
the
power
of
moving
a
to
one
side
or
the
other
according
to
the
direction
of
the
current
la
place
the
illustrious
mathematician
at
once
saw
that
this
fact
could
be
utilised
as
a
telegraph
and
ampere
acting
on
his
suggestion
published
a
feasible
plan
before
the
year
was
out
schweigger
of
halle
multiplied
the
influence
of
the
current
on
the
needle
by
coiling
the
wire
about
it
ten
years
later
ritchie
improved
on
ampere
method
and
exhibited
a
model
at
the
royal
institution
london
about
the
same
time
baron
pawel
schilling
a
russian
nobleman
still
further
modified
it
and
the
emperor
nicholas
decreed
the
erection
of
a
line
from
cronstadt
to

with
a
cable
in

of
finland
but
schilling
died
in
and
the
project
was
never
realised
in
professors
gauss
and
weber
constructed
a
telegraph
between
the
physical
cabinet
and
the
observatory
of
the
university
of
gottingen
at
first
they
used
the
voltaic
pile
but
abandoned
it
in
favour
of
faraday
recent
discovery
that
electricity
could
be
generated
in
a
wire
by
the
motion
of
a
magnet
the
magnetic
key
with
which
the
message
was
sent
produced
by
its
action
an
electric
current
which
after
traversing
the
line
passed
through
a
coil
and
deflected
a
suspended
magnet
to
the
right
or
left
according
to
the
direction
of
the
current
a
mirror
attached
to
the
suspension
magnified
the
movement
of
the
needle
and
indicated
the
signals
after
the
manner
of
the
thomson
mirror
galvanometer
this
telegraph
which
was
large
and
clumsy
was
nevertheless
used
not
only
for
scientific
but
for
general
correspondence
steinheil
of
munich
simplified
it
and
added
an
alarm
in
the
form
of
a
bell
in
steinheil
also
devised
a
recording
telegraph
in
which
the
movable
needles
indicated
the
message
by
marking
dots
and
dashes
with
printer
ink
on
a
ribbon
of
travelling
paper
according
to
an
artificial
code
in
which
the
fewest
signs
were
given
to
the
commonest
letters
in
the
german
language
with
this
apparatus
the
message
was
registered
at
the
rate
of
six
words
a
minute
the
early
experimenters
as
we
have
seen
especially
salva
had
utilised
the
ground
as
the
return
part
of
the
circuit
and
salva
had
proposed
to
use
it
on
his
telegraph
but
steinheil
was
the
first
to
demonstrate
its
practical
value
in
trying
on
the
suggestion
of
gauss
to
employ
the
rails
of
the
nurenberg
to
furth
railway
as
the
conducting
line
for
a
telegraph
in
the
year
he
found
they
would
not
serve
but
the
failure
led
him
to
employ
the
earth
as
the
return
half
of
the
circuit
in
professor
stratingh
of
groninque
holland
devised
a
telegraph
in
which
the
signals
were
made
by
actuating
the
hammers
of
two
gongs
or
bells
of
different
tone
and
amyot
invented
an
automatic
sending
key
in
the
nature
of
a
musical
box
from
edward
davy
a
devonshire
surgeon
exhibited
a
needle
telegraph
in
london
and
proposed
one
based
on
the
discovery
of
arago
that
a
piece
of
soft
iron
is
temporarily
magnetised
by
the
passage
of
an
electric
current
through
a
coil
surrounding
it
this
principle
was
further
applied
by
morse
in
his
printing
telegraph
davy
was
a
prolific
inventor
and
also
sketched
out
a
telegraph
in
which
the
gases
evolved
from
water
which
was
decomposed
by
the
current
actuated
a
recording
pen
but
his
most
valuable
discovery
was
the
that
is
to
say
an
auxiliary
device
by
which
a
current
too
feeble
to
indicate
the
signals
could
call
into
play
a
local
battery
strong
enough
to
make
them
davy
was
in
a
fair
way
of
becoming
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
working
telegraph
when
his
private
affairs
obliged
him
to
emigrate
to
australia
and
leave
the
course
open
to
cooke
and
wheatstone
chapter
ii
charles
wheatstone
the
electric
telegraph
like
the
and
the
railway
was
a
gradual
development
due
to
the
experiments
and
devices
of
a
long
train
of
thinkers
in
such
a
case
he
who
crowns
the
work
making
it
serviceable
to
his
not
only
wins
the
pecuniary
prize
but
is
likely
to
be
hailed
and
celebrated
as
the
chief
if
not
the
sole
inventor
although
in
a
scientific
sense
the
improvement
he
has
made
is
perhaps
less
than
that
of
some
ingenious
and
forgotten
forerunner
he
who
advances
the
work
from
the
phase
of
a
promising
idea
to
that
of
a
common
boon
is
entitled
to
our
gratitude
but
in
honouring
the
keystone
of
the
arch
as
it
were
let
us
acknowledge
the
substructure
on
which
it
rests
and
keep
in
mind
the
entire
bridge
justice
at
least
is
due
to
those
who
have
laboured
without
reward
sir
william
fothergill
cooke
and
sir
charles
wheatstone
were
the
first
to
bring
the
electric
telegraph
into
daily
use
but
we
have
selected
wheatstone
as
our
hero
because
he
was
eminent
as
a
man
of
science
and
chiefly
instrumental
in
perfecting
the
apparatus
as
james
watt
is
identified
with
the
and
george
stephenson
with
the
railway
so
is
wheatstone
with
the
telegraph
charles
wheatstone
was
born
near
gloucester
in
february
his
father
was
a
in
the
town
who
four
years
later
removed
to
pall
mall
london
and
became
a
teacher
of
the
flute
he
used
to
say
with
not
a
little
pride
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
assisting
at
the
musical
education
of
the
princess
charlotte
charles
the
second
son
went
to
a
village
school
near
gloucester
and
afterwards
to
several
institutions
in
london
one
of
them
was
in
kennington
and
kept
by
a
castlemaine
who
was
astonished
at
his
rapid
progress
from
another
he
ran
away
but
was
captured
at
windsor
not
far
from
the
theatre
of
his
practical
telegraph
as
a
boy
he
was
very
shy
and
sensitive
liking
well
to
retire
into
an
attic
without
any
other
company
than
his
own
thoughts
when
he
was
about
fourteen
years
old
he
was
apprenticed
to
his
uncle
and
namesake
a
maker
and
seller
of
musical
instruments
at
strand
london
but
he
showed
little
taste
for
handicraft
or
business
and
loved
better
to
study
books
his
father
encouraged
him
in
this
and
finally
took
him
out
of
the
uncle
charge
at
the
age
of
fifteen
wheatstone
translated
french
poetry
and
wrote
two
songs
one
of
which
was
given
to
his
uncle
who
published
it
without
knowing
it
as
his
nephew
composition
some
lines
of
his
on
the
lyre
became
the
motto
of
an
engraving
by
bartolozzi
small
for
his
age
but
with
a
fine
brow
and
intelligent
blue
eyes
he
often
visited
an
old
in
the
vicinity
of
pall
mall
which
was
then
a
dilapidated
and
unpaved
thoroughfare
most
of
his
was
spent
in
purchasing
the
books
which
had
taken
his
fancy
whether
fairy
tales
history
or
science
one
day
to
the
surprise
of
the
bookseller
he
coveted
a
volume
on
the
discoveries
of
volta
in
electricity
but
not
having
the
price
he
saved
his
pennies
and
secured
the
volume
it
was
written
in
french
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
save
again
till
he
could
buy
a
dictionary
then
he
began
to
read
the
volume
and
with
the
help
of
his
elder
brother
william
to
repeat
the
experiments
described
in
it
with
a
battery
in
the
scullery
behind
his
father
house
in
constructing
the
battery
the
boy
philosophers
ran
short
of
money
to
procure
the
requisite
they
had
only
a
few
copper
coins
left
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
charles
who
was
the
leading
spirit
in
these
researches
must
use
the
pennies
themselves
said
he
and
the
battery
was
soon
complete
in
september
wheatstone
brought
himself
into
public
notice
by
exhibiting
the
lyre
or
at
a
at
pall
mall
and
in
the
adelaide
gallery
it
consisted
of
a
mimic
lyre
hung
from
the
ceiling
by
a
cord
and
emitting
the
strains
of
several
instruments
the
piano
harp
and
dulcimer
in
reality
it
was
a
mere
sounding
box
and
the
cord
was
a
steel
rod
that
conveyed
the
vibrations
of
the
music
from
the
several
instruments
which
were
played
out
of
sight
and
at
this
period
wheatstone
made
numerous
experiments
on
sound
and
its
transmission
some
of
his
results
are
preserved
in
thomson
annals
of
philosophy
for
he
recognised
that
sound
is
propagated
by
waves
or
oscillations
of
the
atmosphere
as
light
by
undulations
of
the
luminiferous
ether
water
and
solid
bodies
such
as
glass
or
metal
or
sonorous
wood
convey
the
modulations
with
high
velocity
and
he
conceived
the
plan
of
transmitting
music
or
speech
to
long
distances
by
this
means
he
estimated
that
sound
would
travel
miles
a
second
through
solid
rods
and
proposed
to
telegraph
from
london
to
edinburgh
in
this
way
he
even
called
his
arrangement
a
robert
hooke
in
his
micrographia
published
in
writes
can
assure
the
reader
that
i
have
by
the
help
of
a
distended
wire
propagated
the
sound
to
a
very
considerable
distance
in
an
instant
or
with
as
seemingly
quick
a
motion
as
that
of
light
nor
was
it
essential
the
wire
should
be
straight
it
might
be
bent
into
angles
this
property
is
the
basis
of
the
mechanical
or
telephone
said
to
have
been
known
to
the
chinese
many
centuries
ago
hooke
also
considered
the
possibility
of
finding
a
way
to
quicken
our
powers
of
hearing
a
writer
in
the
repository
of
arts
for
september
in
referring
to
the
lyre
beholds
the
prospect
of
an
opera
being
performed
at
the
king
theatre
and
enjoyed
at
the
hanover
square
rooms
or
even
at
the
horns
tavern
kennington
the
vibrations
are
to
travel
through
underground
conductors
like
to
gas
in
pipes
if
music
be
capable
of
being
thus
conducted
he
observes
the
words
of
speech
may
be
susceptible
of
the
same
means
of
propagation
the
eloquence
of
counsel
the
debates
of
parliament
instead
of
being
read
the
next
day
only
but
we
shall
lose
ourselves
in
the
pursuit
of
this
curious
subject
besides
transmitting
sounds
to
a
distance
wheatstone
devised
a
simple
instrument
for
augmenting
feeble
sounds
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
it
consisted
of
two
slender
rods
which
conveyed
the
mechanical
vibrations
to
both
ears
and
is
quite
different
from
the
electrical
microphone
of
professor
hughes
in
his
uncle
the
musical
instrument
maker
died
and
wheatstone
with
his
elder
brother
william
took
over
the
business
charles
had
no
great
liking
for
the
commercial
part
but
his
ingenuity
found
a
vent
in
making
improvements
on
the
existing
instruments
and
in
devising
philosophical
toys
at
the
end
of
six
years
he
retired
from
the
undertaking
in
wheatstone
introduced
his
a
device
for
rendering
the
vibrations
of
a
sounding
body
apparent
to
the
eye
it
consists
of
a
metal
rod
carrying
at
its
end
a
silvered
bead
which
reflects
a
of
light
as
the
rod
vibrates
the
spot
is
seen
to
describe
complicated
figures
in
the
air
like
a
spark
whirled
about
in
the
darkness
his
photometer
was
probably
suggested
by
this
appliance
it
enables
two
lights
to
be
compared
by
the
relative
brightness
of
their
reflections
in
a
silvered
bead
which
describes
a
narrow
ellipse
so
as
to
draw
the
spots
into
parallel
lines
in
wheatstone
improved
the
german
wind
instrument
called
the
mund
harmonica
till
it
became
the
popular
concertina
patented
on
june
the
portable
harmonium
is
another
of
his
inventions
which
gained
a
prize
medal
at
the
great
exhibition
of
he
also
improved
the
speaking
machine
of
de
kempelen
and
endorsed
the
opinion
of
sir
david
brewster
that
before
the
end
of
this
century
a
singing
and
talking
apparatus
would
be
among
the
conquests
of
science
in
wheatstone
who
had
won
a
name
for
himself
was
appointed
to
the
chair
of
experimental
physics
in
king
college
london
but
his
first
course
of
lectures
on
sound
were
a
complete
failure
owing
to
an
invincible
repugnance
to
public
speaking
and
a
distrust
of
his
powers
in
that
direction
in
the
rostrum
he
was
and
incapable
sometimes
turning
his
back
on
the
audience
and
mumbling
to
the
diagrams
on
the
wall
in
the
laboratory
he
felt
himself
at
home
and
ever
after
confined
his
duties
mostly
to
demonstration
he
achieved
renown
by
a
great
experiment
the
measurement
of
the
velocity
of
electricity
in
a
wire
his
method
was
beautiful
and
ingenious
he
cut
the
wire
at
the
middle
to
form
a
gap
which
a
spark
might
leap
across
and
connected
its
ends
to
the
poles
of
a
leyden
jar
filled
with
electricity
three
sparks
were
thus
produced
one
at
either
end
of
the
wire
and
another
at
the
middle
he
mounted
a
tiny
mirror
on
the
works
of
a
watch
so
that
it
revolved
at
a
high
velocity
and
observed
the
reflections
of
his
three
sparks
in
it
the
points
of
the
wire
were
so
arranged
that
if
the
sparks
were
instantaneous
their
reflections
would
appear
in
one
straight
line
but
the
middle
one
was
seen
to
lag
behind
the
others
because
it
was
an
instant
later
the
electricity
had
taken
a
certain
time
to
travel
from
the
ends
of
the
wire
to
the
middle
this
time
was
found
by
measuring
the
amount
of
lag
and
comparing
it
with
the
known
velocity
of
the
mirror
having
got
the
time
he
had
only
to
compare
that
with
the
length
of
half
the
wire
and
he
found
that
the
velocity
of
electricity
was
miles
a
second
till
then
many
people
had
considered
the
electric
discharge
to
be
instantaneous
but
it
was
afterwards
found
that
its
velocity
depended
on
the
nature
of
the
conductor
its
resistance
and
its
capacity
faraday
showed
for
example
that
its
velocity
in
a
submarine
wire
coated
with
insulator
and
surrounded
with
water
is
only
miles
a
second
or
still
less
wheatstone
device
of
the
revolving
mirror
was
afterwards
employed
by
foucault
and
fizeau
to
measure
the
velocity
of
light
in
at
the
dublin
meeting
of
the
british
association
wheatstone
showed
that
when
metals
were
volatilised
in
the
electric
spark
their
light
examined
through
a
prism
revealed
certain
rays
which
were
characteristic
of
them
thus
the
kind
of
metals
which
formed
the
sparking
points
could
be
determined
by
analysing
the
light
of
the
spark
this
suggestion
has
been
of
great
service
in
spectrum
analysis
and
as
applied
by
bunsen
kirchoff
and
others
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
several
new
elements
such
as
rubidium
and
thallium
as
well
as
increasing
our
knowledge
of
the
heavenly
bodies
two
years
later
he
called
attention
to
the
value
of
as
a
mode
of
generating
a
current
by
means
of
heat
and
since
then
a
variety
of
have
been
invented
some
of
which
have
proved
of
considerable
advantage
wheatstone
abandoned
his
idea
of
transmitting
intelligence
by
the
mechanical
vibration
of
rods
and
took
up
the
electric
telegraph
in
he
lectured
on
the
system
of
baron
schilling
and
declared
that
the
means
were
already
known
by
which
an
electric
telegraph
could
be
made
of
great
service
to
the
world
he
made
experiments
with
a
plan
of
his
own
and
not
only
proposed
to
lay
an
experimental
line
across
the
thames
but
to
establish
it
on
the
london
and
birmingham
railway
before
these
plans
were
carried
out
however
he
received
a
visit
from
fothergill
cooke
at
his
house
in
conduit
street
on
february
which
had
an
important
influence
on
his
future
cooke
was
an
officer
in
the
madras
army
who
being
home
on
furlough
was
attending
some
lectures
on
anatomy
at
the
university
of
heidelberg
where
on
march
he
witnessed
a
demonstration
with
the
telegraph
of
professor
moncke
and
was
so
impressed
with
its
importance
that
he
forsook
his
medical
studies
and
devoted
all
his
efforts
to
the
work
of
introducing
the
telegraph
he
returned
to
london
soon
after
and
was
able
to
exhibit
a
telegraph
with
three
needles
in
january
feeling
his
want
of
scientific
knowledge
he
consulted
faraday
and
roget
the
latter
of
whom
sent
him
to
wheatstone
at
a
second
interview
cooke
told
wheatstone
of
his
intention
to
bring
out
a
working
telegraph
and
explained
his
method
wheatstone
according
to
his
own
statement
remarked
to
cooke
that
the
method
would
not
act
and
produced
his
own
experimental
telegraph
finally
cooke
proposed
that
they
should
enter
into
a
partnership
but
wheatstone
was
at
first
reluctant
to
comply
he
was
a
man
of
science
and
had
meant
to
publish
his
results
without
seeking
to
make
capital
of
them
cooke
on
the
other
hand
declared
that
his
sole
object
was
to
make
a
fortune
from
the
scheme
in
may
they
agreed
to
join
their
forces
wheatstone
contributing
the
scientific
and
cooke
the
administrative
talent
the
deed
of
partnership
was
dated
november
a
joint
patent
was
taken
out
for
their
inventions
including
the
telegraph
of
wheatstone
and
an
alarm
worked
by
a
relay
in
which
the
current
by
dipping
a
needle
into
mercury
completed
a
local
circuit
and
released
the
detent
of
a
clockwork
the
telegraph
which
was
mainly
if
not
entirely
due
to
wheatstone
was
similar
to
that
of
schilling
and
based
on
the
principle
enunciated
by
ampere
that
is
to
say
the
current
was
sent
into
the
line
by
completing
the
circuit
of
the
battery
with
a
make
and
break
key
and
at
the
other
end
it
passed
through
a
coil
of
wire
surrounding
a
magnetic
needle
free
to
turn
round
its
centre
according
as
one
pole
of
the
battery
or
the
other
was
applied
to
the
line
by
means
of
the
key
the
current
deflected
the
needle
to
one
side
or
the
other
there
were
five
separate
circuits
actuating
five
different
needles
the
latter
were
pivoted
in
rows
across
the
middle
of
a
dial
shaped
like
a
diamond
and
having
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
arranged
upon
it
in
such
a
way
that
a
letter
was
literally
pointed
out
by
the
current
deflecting
two
of
the
needles
towards
it
an
experimental
line
with
a
sixth
return
wire
was
run
between
the
euston
terminus
and
camden
town
station
of
the
london
and
north
western
railway
on
july
the
actual
distance
was
only
one
and
a
half
mile
but
spare
wire
had
been
inserted
in
the
circuit
to
increase
its
length
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
the
trial
took
place
cooke
was
in
charge
at
camden
town
while
robert
stephenson
and
other
gentlemen
looked
on
and
wheatstone
sat
at
his
instrument
in
a
dingy
little
room
lit
by
a
tallow
candle
near
the
at
euston
wheatstone
sent
the
first
message
to
which
cooke
replied
and
said
wheatstone
i
feel
such
a
tumultuous
sensation
before
as
when
all
alone
in
the
still
room
i
heard
the
needles
click
and
as
i
spelled
the
words
i
felt
all
the
magnitude
of
the
invention
pronounced
to
be
practicable
beyond
cavil
or
dispute
in
spite
of
this
trial
however
the
directors
of
the
railway
treated
the
invention
with
indifference
and
requested
its
removal
in
july
however
it
was
favoured
by
the
great
western
railway
and
a
line
erected
from
the
paddington
terminus
to
west
drayton
station
a
distance
of
thirteen
miles
part
of
the
wire
was
laid
underground
at
first
but
subsequently
all
of
it
was
raised
on
posts
along
the
line
their
circuit
was
eventually
extended
to
slough
in
and
was
publicly
exhibited
at
paddington
as
a
marvel
of
science
which
could
transmit
fifty
signals
a
distance
of
miles
in
a
minute
the
price
of
admission
was
a
shilling
notwithstanding
its
success
the
public
did
not
readily
patronise
the
new
invention
until
its
utility
was
noised
abroad
by
the
clever
capture
of
the
murderer
tawell
between
six
and
seven
one
morning
a
woman
named
sarah
hart
was
found
dead
in
her
home
at
salt
hill
and
a
man
had
been
observed
to
leave
her
house
some
time
before
the
police
knew
that
she
was
visited
from
time
to
time
by
a
john
tawell
from
berkhampstead
where
he
was
much
respected
and
on
inquiring
and
arriving
at
slough
they
found
that
a
person
answering
his
description
had
booked
by
a
slow
train
for
london
and
entered
a
carriage
the
police
telegraphed
at
once
to
paddington
giving
the
particulars
and
desiring
his
capture
is
in
the
garb
of
a
quaker
ran
the
message
a
brown
coat
on
which
reaches
nearly
to
his
feet
there
was
no
in
the
alphabet
of
the
instrument
and
the
clerk
at
slough
began
to
spell
the
word
with
a
but
when
he
had
got
so
far
he
was
interrupted
by
the
clerk
at
paddington
who
asked
him
to
the
repetition
fared
no
better
until
a
boy
at
paddington
suggested
that
slough
should
be
allowed
to
finish
the
word
was
understood
and
as
soon
as
tawell
stepped
out
on
the
platform
at
paddington
he
was
by
a
detective
who
followed
him
into
a
new
road
omnibus
and
arrested
him
in
a
coffee
tavern
tawell
was
tried
for
the
murder
of
the
woman
and
astounding
revelations
were
made
as
to
his
character
transported
in
for
the
crime
of
forgery
he
obtained
a
and
started
as
a
chemist
in
sydney
where
he
flourished
and
after
fifteen
years
left
it
a
rich
man
returning
to
england
he
married
a
quaker
lady
as
his
second
wife
he
confessed
to
the
murder
of
sarah
hart
by
prussic
acid
his
motive
being
a
dread
of
their
relations
becoming
known
tawell
was
executed
and
the
notoriety
of
the
case
brought
the
telegraph
into
repute
its
advantages
as
a
rapid
means
of
conveying
intelligence
and
detecting
criminals
had
been
signally
demonstrated
and
it
was
soon
adopted
on
a
more
extensive
scale
in
wheatstone
introduced
two
improved
forms
of
the
apparatus
namely
the
and
the
needle
instruments
in
which
the
signals
were
made
by
the
successive
deflections
of
the
needles
of
these
the
instrument
requiring
only
one
wire
is
still
in
use
in
a
difference
arose
between
cooke
and
wheatstone
as
to
the
share
of
each
in
the
honour
of
inventing
the
telegraph
the
question
was
submitted
to
the
arbitration
of
the
famous
engineer
marc
isambard
brunel
on
behalf
of
cooke
and
professor
daniell
of
king
college
the
inventor
of
the
daniell
battery
on
the
part
of
wheatstone
they
awarded
to
cooke
the
credit
of
having
introduced
the
telegraph
as
a
useful
undertaking
which
promised
to
be
of
national
importance
and
to
wheatstone
that
of
having
by
his
researches
prepared
the
public
to
receive
it
they
concluded
with
the
words
is
to
the
united
labours
of
two
gentlemen
so
well
qualified
for
mutual
assistance
that
we
must
attribute
the
rapid
progress
which
this
important
invention
has
made
during
five
years
since
they
have
been
associated
the
decision
however
vague
pronounces
the
needle
telegraph
a
joint
production
if
it
was
mainly
invented
by
wheatstone
it
was
chiefly
introduced
by
cooke
their
respective
shares
in
the
undertaking
might
be
compared
to
that
of
an
author
and
his
publisher
but
for
the
fact
that
cooke
himself
had
a
share
in
the
actual
work
of
invention
in
wheatstone
had
patented
an
alphabetical
telegraph
or
a
b
c
instrument
which
moved
with
a
motion
and
showed
the
letters
of
the
message
upon
a
dial
the
same
principle
was
utilised
in
his
telegraph
patented
in
this
was
the
first
apparatus
which
printed
a
telegram
in
type
it
was
worked
by
two
circuits
and
as
the
type
revolved
a
hammer
actuated
by
the
current
pressed
the
required
letter
on
the
paper
in
wheatstone
also
brought
out
his
machine
for
generating
continuous
currents
and
his
chronoscope
for
measuring
minute
intervals
of
time
which
was
used
in
determining
the
speed
of
a
bullet
or
the
passage
of
a
star
in
this
apparatus
an
electric
current
actuated
an
which
noted
the
instant
of
an
occurrence
by
means
of
a
pencil
on
a
moving
paper
it
is
said
to
have
been
capable
of
distinguishing
part
of
a
second
and
the
time
a
body
took
to
fall
from
a
height
of
one
inch
the
same
year
he
was
awarded
the
royal
medal
of
the
royal
society
for
his
explanation
of
binocular
vision
a
research
which
led
him
to
construct
the
stereoscope
he
showed
that
our
impression
of
solidity
is
gained
by
the
combination
in
the
mind
of
two
separate
pictures
of
an
object
taken
by
both
of
our
eyes
from
different
points
of
view
thus
in
the
stereoscope
an
arrangement
of
lenses
and
mirrors
two
photographs
of
the
same
object
taken
from
different
points
are
so
combined
as
to
make
the
object
stand
out
with
a
solid
aspect
sir
david
brewster
improved
the
stereoscope
by
dispensing
with
the
mirrors
and
bringing
it
into
its
existing
form
the
wheatstone
was
partial
to
exotic
forms
of
speech
was
introduced
by
its
professor
in
and
is
in
some
sort
the
reverse
of
the
stereoscope
since
it
causes
a
solid
object
to
seem
hollow
and
a
nearer
one
to
be
farther
off
thus
a
bust
appears
to
be
a
mask
and
a
tree
growing
outside
of
a
window
looks
as
if
it
were
growing
inside
the
room
on
november
he
exhibited
his
clock
in
the
library
of
the
royal
society
and
propounded
a
plan
for
distributing
the
correct
time
from
a
standard
clock
to
a
number
of
local
timepieces
the
circuits
of
these
were
to
be
electrified
by
a
key
or
actuated
by
the
arbour
of
the
standard
and
their
hands
corrected
by
the
following
january
alexander
bain
took
out
a
patent
for
an
clock
and
he
subsequently
charged
wheatstone
with
appropriating
his
ideas
it
appears
that
bain
worked
as
a
mechanist
to
wheatstone
from
august
to
december
and
he
asserted
that
he
had
communicated
the
idea
of
an
electric
clock
to
wheatstone
during
that
period
but
wheatstone
maintained
that
he
had
experimented
in
that
direction
during
may
bain
further
accused
wheatstone
of
stealing
his
idea
of
the
printing
telegraph
but
wheatstone
showed
that
the
instrument
was
only
a
modification
of
his
own
telegraph
in
wheatstone
communicated
an
important
paper
to
the
royal
society
entitled
account
of
several
new
processes
for
determining
the
constants
of
a
voltaic
circuit
it
contained
an
exposition
of
the
balance
for
measuring
the
electrical
resistance
of
a
conductor
which
still
goes
by
the
name
of
wheatstone
bridge
or
balance
although
it
was
first
devised
by
christie
of
the
royal
military
academy
woolwich
who
published
it
in
the
philosophical
transactions
for
the
method
was
neglected
until
wheatstone
brought
it
into
notice
his
paper
abounds
with
simple
and
practical
formula
for
the
calculation
of
currents
and
resistances
by
the
law
of
ohm
he
introduced
a
unit
of
resistance
namely
a
foot
of
copper
wire
weighing
one
hundred
grains
and
showed
how
it
might
be
applied
to
measure
the
length
of
wire
by
its
resistance
he
was
awarded
a
medal
for
his
paper
by
the
society
the
same
year
he
invented
an
apparatus
which
enabled
the
reading
of
a
thermometer
or
a
barometer
to
be
registered
at
a
distance
by
means
of
an
electric
contact
made
by
the
mercury
a
sound
telegraph
in
which
the
signals
were
given
by
the
strokes
of
a
bell
was
also
patented
by
cooke
and
wheatstone
in
may
of
that
year
the
introduction
of
the
telegraph
had
so
far
advanced
that
on
september
the
electric
telegraph
company
was
registered
and
wheatstone
by
his
deed
of
partnership
with
cooke
received
a
sum
of
for
the
use
of
their
joint
inventions
from
wheatstone
had
thought
a
good
deal
about
submarine
telegraphs
and
in
he
gave
evidence
before
the
railway
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
on
the
feasibility
of
the
proposed
line
from
dover
to
calais
he
had
even
designed
the
machinery
for
making
and
laying
the
cable
in
the
autumn
of
with
the
assistance
of
llewellyn
he
submerged
a
length
of
insulated
wire
in
swansea
bay
and
signalled
through
it
from
a
boat
to
the
mumbles
lighthouse
next
year
he
suggested
the
use
of
for
the
coating
of
the
intended
wire
across
the
channel
though
silent
and
reserved
in
public
wheatstone
was
a
clear
and
voluble
talker
in
private
if
taken
on
his
favourite
studies
and
his
small
but
active
person
his
plain
but
intelligent
countenance
was
full
of
animation
sir
henry
taylor
tells
us
that
he
once
observed
wheatstone
at
an
evening
party
in
oxford
earnestly
holding
forth
to
lord
palmerston
on
the
capabilities
of
his
telegraph
do
say
so
exclaimed
the
statesman
must
get
you
to
tell
that
to
the
lord
chancellor
and
so
saying
he
fastened
the
electrician
on
lord
westbury
and
effected
his
escape
a
reminiscence
of
this
interview
may
have
prompted
palmerston
to
remark
that
a
time
was
coming
when
a
minister
might
be
asked
in
parliament
if
war
had
broken
out
in
india
and
would
reply
a
minute
i
just
telegraph
to
the
and
let
you
know
at
christchurch
marylebone
on
february
wheatstone
was
married
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
a
taunton
tradesman
and
of
handsome
appearance
she
died
in
leaving
a
family
of
five
young
children
to
his
care
his
domestic
life
was
quiet
and
uneventful
one
of
wheatstone
most
ingenious
devices
was
the
clock
exhibited
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
in
it
is
based
on
the
fact
discovered
by
sir
david
brewster
that
the
light
of
the
sky
is
polarised
in
a
plane
at
an
angle
of
ninety
degrees
from
the
position
of
the
sun
it
follows
that
by
discovering
that
plane
of
polarisation
and
measuring
its
azimuth
with
respect
to
the
north
the
position
of
the
sun
although
beneath
the
horizon
could
be
determined
and
the
apparent
solar
time
obtained
the
clock
consisted
of
a
having
a
nichol
or
prism
for
an
and
a
thin
plate
of
selenite
for
an
when
the
tube
was
directed
to
the
north
pole
that
is
parallel
to
the
earth
axis
and
the
prism
of
the
turned
until
no
colour
was
seen
the
angle
of
turning
as
shown
by
an
index
moving
with
the
prism
over
a
graduated
limb
gave
the
hour
of
day
the
device
is
of
little
service
in
a
country
where
watches
are
reliable
but
it
formed
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
north
polar
expedition
commanded
by
captain
nares
wheatstone
remarkable
ingenuity
was
displayed
in
the
invention
of
cyphers
which
have
never
been
unravelled
and
interpreting
cypher
manuscripts
in
the
british
museum
which
had
defied
the
experts
he
devised
a
cryptograph
or
machine
for
turning
a
message
into
cypher
which
could
only
be
interpreted
by
putting
the
cypher
into
a
corresponding
machine
adjusted
to
reproduce
it
the
rapid
development
of
the
telegraph
in
europe
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
in
the
death
of
the
emperor
nicholas
at
petersburg
about
one
in
the
afternoon
was
announced
in
the
house
of
lords
a
few
hours
later
and
as
a
striking
proof
of
its
further
progress
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
result
of
the
oaks
of
was
received
in
new
york
fifteen
seconds
after
the
horses
passed
the
wheatstone
next
great
invention
was
the
automatic
transmitter
in
which
the
signals
of
the
message
are
first
punched
out
on
a
strip
of
paper
which
is
then
passed
through
the
and
controls
the
signal
currents
by
substituting
a
mechanism
for
the
hand
in
sending
the
message
he
was
able
to
telegraph
about
words
a
minute
or
five
times
the
ordinary
rate
in
the
postal
telegraph
service
this
apparatus
is
employed
for
sending
press
telegrams
and
it
has
recently
been
so
much
improved
that
messages
are
now
sent
from
london
to
bristol
at
a
speed
of
words
a
minute
and
even
of
words
a
minute
between
london
and
aberdeen
on
the
night
of
april
when
gladstone
introduced
his
bill
for
home
rule
in
ireland
no
fewer
than
words
were
despatched
from
the
central
station
at
by
wheatstone
transmitters
were
gladstone
himself
to
speak
for
a
whole
week
night
and
day
and
with
his
usual
facility
he
could
hardly
surpass
this
achievement
the
plan
of
sending
messages
by
a
running
strip
of
paper
which
actuates
the
key
was
originally
patented
by
bain
in
but
wheatstone
aided
by
augustus
stroh
an
accomplished
mechanician
and
an
able
experimenter
was
the
first
to
bring
the
idea
into
successful
operation
in
wheatstone
was
appointed
by
the
board
of
trade
to
report
on
the
subject
of
the
atlantic
cables
and
in
he
was
one
of
the
experts
who
advised
the
atlantic
telegraph
company
on
the
construction
of
the
successful
lines
of
and
on
february
he
published
the
principle
of
reaction
in
the
machine
by
a
paper
to
the
royal
society
but
siemens
had
communicated
the
identical
discovery
ten
days
earlier
and
both
papers
were
read
on
the
same
day
it
afterwards
appeared
that
herr
werner
siemens
samuel
alfred
varley
and
professor
wheatstone
had
independently
arrived
at
the
principle
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
varley
patented
it
on
december
siemens
called
attention
to
it
on
january
and
wheatstone
exhibited
it
in
action
at
the
royal
society
on
the
above
date
but
it
will
be
seen
from
our
life

samuel
morse
cooke
and
wheatstone
were
the
first
to
introduce
a
public
telegraph
worked
by
but
it
had
the
disadvantage
of
not
marking
down
the
message
there
was
still
room
for
an
instrument
which
would
leave
a
permanent
record
that
might
be
read
at
leisure
and
this
was
the
invention
of
samuel

was
born
at

after
he
died
his

as
well
as

is
described
as
a

they
had
two

the
second
of

an

was
the
trusted
friend
and

of
his

brother
at
the
age
of
four
samuel
was
sent
to
an
infant
school
kept
by
an
old
lady
who
being
lame
was
unable
to
leave
her
chair
but
carried
her
authority
to
the
remotest
parts
of
her
dominion
by
the
help
of
a
long
rattan
samuel
like
the
rest
had
felt
the
sudden
apparition
of
this
monitor
having
scratched
a
portrait
of
the
dame
upon
a
chest
of
drawers
with
the
point
of
a
pin
he
was
called
out
and
summarily
punished
years
later
when
he
became
notable
the
drawers
were
treasured
by
one
of
his
admirers
he
entered
a
preparatory
school
at
andover
when
he
was
seven
years
old
and
showed
himself
an
eager
pupil
among
other
books
he
was
delighted
with
plutarch
lives
and
at
thirteen
he
composed
a
biography
of
demosthenes
long
preserved
by
his
family
a
year
later
he
entered
yale
college
as
a
freshman
during
his
curriculum
he
attended
the
lectures
of
professor
jeremiah
day
on
natural
philosophy
and
professor
benjamin
sieliman
on
chemistry
and
it
was
then
he
imbibed
his
earliest
knowledge
of
electricity
in
day
was
teaching
from
enfield
on
philosophy
that
the
electric
circuit
be
interrupted
the
fluid
will
become
visible
and
when
it
passes
it
will
leave
an
impression
upon
any
intermediate
body
and
he
illustrated
this
by
sending
the
spark
through
a
metal
chain
so
that
it
became
visible
between
the
links
and
by
causing
it
to
perforate
paper
morse
afterwards
declared
this
experiment
to
have
been
the
seed
which
rooted
in
his
mind
and
grew
into
the
of
the
telegraph
it
is
not
evident
that
morse
had
any
distinct
idea
of
the
electric
telegraph
in
these
days
but
amidst
his
lessons
in
literature
and
philosophy
he
took
a
special
interest
in
the
sciences
of
electricity
and
chemistry
he
became
acquainted
with
the
voltaic
battery
through
the
lectures
of
his
friend
professor
sieliman
and
we
are
told
that
during
one
of
his
vacations
at
yale
he
made
a
series
of
electrical
experiments
with
dwight
some
years
later
he
resumed
these
studies
under
his
friend
professor
james
freeman
dana
of
the
university
of
new
york
who
exhibited
the
to
his
class
in
and
also
under
professor
renwick
of
columbia
college
art
seems
to
have
had
an
equal
if
not
a
greater
charm
than
science
for
morse
at
this
period
a
boy
of
fifteen
he
made
a
sketch
of
his
family
sitting
round
the
table
and
while
a
student
at
yale
he
relieved
his
father
who
was
far
from
rich
of
a
part
of
his
education
by
painting
miniatures
on
ivory
and
selling
them
to
his
companions
at
five
dollars
before
he
was
nineteen
he
completed
a
painting
of
the
of
the
pilgrims
at
plymouth
which
formerly
hung
in
the
office
of
the
mayor
at
charlestown
massachusetts
on
graduating
at
yale
in
he
devoted
himself
to
art
and
became
a
pupil
of
washington
allston
the
american
painter
he
accompanied
allston
to
europe
in
and
entered
the
studio
of
benjamin
west
who
was
then
at
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
the
friendship
of
west
with
his
own
introductions
and
agreeable
personality
enabled
him
to
move
in
good
society
to
which
he
was
always
partial
william
wilberforce
zachary
macaulay
father
of
the
historian
coleridge
and
copley
were
among
his
acquaintances
leslie
the
artist
then
a
struggling
genius
like
himself
was
his
his
heart
was
evidently
in
the
profession
of
his
choice
passion
for
my
art
he
wrote
to
his
mother
in
so
firmly
rooted
that
i
am
confident
no
human
power
could
destroy
it
the
more
i
study
the
greater
i
think
is
its
claim
to
the
appellation
of
divine
i
am
now
going
to
begin
a
picture
of
the
death
of
hercules
the
figure
to
be
as
large
as
life
after
he
had
perfected
this
work
to
his
own
eyes
he
showed
it
with
not
a
little
pride
to
west
who
after
scanning
it
awhile
said
good
very
good
go
on
and
finish
it
morse
ventured
to
say
that
it
was
finished
no
no
answered
west
there
and
there
and
there
there
is
much
to
be
done
yet
go
on
and
finish
it
each
time
the
pupil
showed
it
the
master
said
on
and
finish
it
the
telegraph
in
america
by
james
reid
this
was
a
lesson
in
thoroughness
of
work
and
attention
to
detail
which
was
not
lost
on
the
student
the
picture
was
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
in
somerset
house
during
the
summer
of
and
west
declared
that
if
morse
were
to
live
to
his
own
age
he
would
never
make
a
better
composition
the
remark
is
equivocal
but
was
doubtless
intended
as
a
compliment
to
the
precocity
of
the
young
painter
in
order
to
be
correct
in
the
anatomy
he
had
first
modelled
the
figure
of
his
hercules
in
clay
and
this
cast
by
the
advice
of
west
was
entered
in
competition
for
a
prize
in
sculpture
given
by
the
society
of
arts
it
proved
successful
and
on
may
the
sculptor
was
presented
with
the
prize
and
a
gold
medal
by
the
duke
of
norfolk
before
a
distinguished
gathering
in
the
adelphi
flushed
with
his
triumph
morse
determined
to
compete
for
the
prize
of
fifty
guineas
and
a
gold
medal
offered
by
the
royal
academy
for
the
best
historical
painting
and
took
for
his
subject
judgment
of
jupiter
in
the
case
of
apollo
marpessa
and
idas
the
work
was
finished
to
the
satisfaction
of
west
but
the
painter
was
summoned
home
he
was
still
in
part
at
least
depending
on
his
father
and
had
been
abroad
a
year
longer
than
the
three
at
first
intended
during
this
time
he
had
been
obliged
to
pinch
himself
in
a
thousand
ways
in
order
to
eke
out
his
modest
allowance
drink
is
water
porter
being
too
expensive
he
wrote
to
his
parents
have
had
no
new
clothes
for
nearly
a
year
my
best
are
threadbare
and
my
shoes
are
out
at
the
toes
my
stockings
all
want
to
see
my
mother
and
my
hat
is
hoary
with
age
west
recommended
him
to
stay
since
the
rules
of
the
competition
required
the
winner
to
receive
the
prize
in
person
but
after
trying
in
vain
to
get
this
regulation
waived
he
left
for
america
with
his
picture
having
a
few
days
prior
to
his
departure
dined
with
wilberforce
as
the
guns
of
hyde
park
were
signalling
the
victory
of
waterloo
arriving
in
boston
on
october
he
lost
no
time
in
renting
a
studio
his
fame
had
preceded
him
and
he
became
the
lion
of
society
his
of
jupiter
was
exhibited
in
the
town
and
people
flocked
to
see
it
but
no
one
offered
to
buy
it
if
the
line
of
high
art
he
had
chosen
had
not
supported
him
in
england
it
was
tantamount
to
starvation
in
the
rawer
atmosphere
of
america
even
in
boston
mellowed
though
it
was
by
culture
the
classical
was
at
a
discount
almost
penniless
and
fretting
under
his
disappointment
he
went
to
concord
new
hampshire
and
contrived
to
earn
a
living
by
painting
cabinet
portraits
was
this
the
end
of
his
ambitious
dreams
money
was
needful
to
extricate
him
from
this
drudgery
and
let
him
follow
up
his
aspirations
love
may
have
been
a
still
stronger
motive
for
its
acquisition
so
he
tried
his
hand
at
invention
and
in
conjunction
with
his
brother
sidney
produced
what
was
playfully
described
as
patent
metallic
and
the
pump
was
quite
as
much
admired
as
the
and
it
proved
as
great
a
failure
succeeding
as
a
portrait
painter
he
went
in
on
the
invitation
of
his
uncle
finley
to
charleston
in
south
carolina
and
opened
a
studio
there
after
a
single
season
he
found
himself
in
a
position
to
marry
and
on
october
was
united
to
lucretia
walker
of
concord
new
hampshire
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
he
thrived
so
well
in
the
south
that
he
once
received
as
many
as
one
hundred
and
fifty
orders
in
a
few
weeks
and
his
reputation
was
such
that
he
was
honoured
with
a
commission
from
the
common
council
of
charleston
to
execute
a
portrait
of
james
monroe
then
president
of
the
united
states
it
was
regarded
as
a
masterpiece
in
january
he
instituted
the
south
carolina
academy
of
fine
arts
which
is
now
extinct
after
four
years
of
life
in
charleston
he
returned
to
the
north
with
savings
to
the
amount
of
and
settled
in
new
york
he
devoted
eighteen
months
to
the
execution
of
a
large
painting
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
capitol
at
washington
but
its
exhibition
proved
a
loss
and
in
helping
his
brothers
to
pay
his
father
debts
the
remains
of
his
little
fortune
were
swept
away
he
stood
next
to
allston
as
an
american
historical
painter
but
all
his
productions
in
that
line
proved
a
disappointment
the
public
would
not
buy
them
on
the
other
hand
he
received
an
order
from
the
corporation
of
new
york
for
a
portrait
of
general
lafayette
the
hero
of
the
hour
while
engaged
on
this
work
he
lost
his
wife
in
february
and
then
his
parents
in
he
visited
europe
and
spent
his
time
among
the
artists
and
art
galleries
of
england
france
and
italy
in
paris
he
undertook
a
picture
of
the
interior
of
the
louvre
showing
some
of
the
masterpieces
in
miniature
but
it
seems
that
nobody
purchased
it
he
expected
to
be
chosen
to
illustrate
one
of
the
vacant
panels
in
the
rotunda
of
the
capitol
at
washington
but
in
this
too
he
was
mistaken
however
some
in
america
thinking
he
had
deserved
the
honour
collected
a
sum
of
money
to
assist
him
in
painting
the
composition
he
had
fixed
upon
signing
of
the
first
compact
on
board
the
mayflower
in
a
far
from
hopeful
mood
after
his
three
years
residence
abroad
he
embarked
on
the
packet
sully
captain
pell
and
sailed
from
havre
for
new
york
on
october
among
the
passengers
was
charles
jackson
of
boston
who
had
attended
some
lectures
on
electricity
in
paris
and
carried
an
in
his
trunk
one
day
while
morse
and
jackson
with
a
few
more
sat
round
the
luncheon
table
in
the
cabin
he
began
to
talk
of
the
experiments
he
had
witnessed
some
one
asked
if
the
speed
of
the
electricity
was
lessened
by
its
passage
through
a
long
wire
and
jackson
referring
to
a
trial
of
faraday
replied
that
the
current
was
apparently
instantaneous
morse
who
probably
remembered
his
old
lessons
in
the
subject
now
remarked
that
if
the
presence
of
the
electricity
could
be
rendered
visible
at
any
point
of
the
circuit
he
saw
no
reason
why
intelligence
might
not
be
sent
by
this
means
the
idea
became
rooted
in
his
mind
and
engrossed
his
thoughts
until
far
into
the
night
he
paced
the
deck
discussing
the
matter
with
jackson
and
pondering
it
in
solitude
ways
of
rendering
the
electricity
sensible
at
the
far
end
of
the
line
were
considered
the
spark
might
pierce
a
band
of
travelling
paper
as
professor
day
had
mentioned
years
before
it
might
decompose
a
chemical
solution
and
leave
a
stain
to
mark
its
passage
as
tried
by
dyar
in
or
it
could
excite
an
which
by
attracting
a
piece
of
soft
iron
would
inscribe
the
passage
with
a
pen
or
pencil
the
signals
could
be
made
by
very
short
currents
or
jets
of
electricity
according
to
a
settled
code
thus
a
certain
number
of
jets
could
represent
a
corresponding
numeral
and
the
numeral
would
in
its
turn
represent
a
word
in
the
language
to
decipher
the
message
a
special
or
dictionary
would
be
required
in
order
to
transmit
the
currents
through
the
line
he
devised
a
mechanical
sender
in
which
the
circuit
would
be
interrupted
by
a
series
of
types
carried
on
a
or
which
travelled
at
a
uniform
speed
each
type
would
have
a
certain
number
of
teeth
or
projections
on
its
upper
face
and
as
it
was
passed
through
a
gap
in
the
circuit
the
teeth
would
make
or
break
the
current
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
the
currents
thus
transmitted
would
excite
the
actuate
the
pencil
and
draw
a
line
on
the
paper
every
angle
being
a
distinct
signal
and
the
groups
of
signals
representing
a
word
in
the
code
during
the
voyage
of
six
weeks
the
artist
jotted
his
crude
ideas
in
his
which
afterwards
became
a
testimony
to
their
date
that
he
cherished
hopes
of
his
invention
may
be
gathered
from
his
words
on
landing
captain
pell
should
you
ever
hear
of
the
telegraph
one
of
these
days
as
the
wonder
of
the
world
remember
the
discovery
was
made
on
the
good
ship
sully
soon
after
his
return
his
brothers
gave
him
a
room
on
the
fifth
floor
of
a
house
at
the
corner
of
nassau
and
beekman
streets
new
york
for
a
long
time
it
was
his
studio
and
kitchen
his
laboratory
and
bedroom
with
his
livelihood
to
earn
by
his
brush
and
his
invention
to
work
out
morse
was
now
fully
occupied
his
diet
was
simple
he
denied
himself
the
pleasures
of
society
and
employed
his
leisure
in
making
models
of
his
types
the
studio
was
an
image
of
his
mind
at
this
epoch
rejected
pictures
looked
down
upon
his
clumsy
apparatus
lay
among
the
jostled
the
galvanic
battery
and
the
easel
shared
his
attention
with
the
lathe
by
degrees
the
telegraph
allured
him
from
the
canvas
and
he
only
painted
enough
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
his
national
picture
signing
of
the
first
compact
on
board
the
mayflower
was
never
finished
and
the
dollars
which
had
been
subscribed
for
it
were
finally
returned
with
interest
for
morse
by
nature
was
proud
and
independent
with
a
sensitive
horror
of
incurring
debt
he
would
rather
endure
privation
than
solicit
help
or
lie
under
a
humiliating
obligation
his
mother
seems
to
have
been
animated
with
a
like
spirit
for
the
hon
amos
kendall
informs
us
that
she
had
suffered
much
through
the
kindness
of
her
husband
in
becoming
surety
for
his
friends
and
that
when
she
was
dying
she
exacted
a
promise
from
her
son
that
he
would
never
endanger
his
peace
of
mind
and
the
comfort
of
his
home
by
doing
likewise
during
the
two
and
a
half
years
from
november
to
the
summer
of
he
was
obliged
to
change
his
residence
three
times
and
want
of
money
prevented
him
from
combining
the
several
parts
of
his
invention
into
a
working
whole
in
however
his
reputation
as
an
historical
painter
and
the
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
as
a
man
of
culture
and
refinement
led
to
his
appointment
as
the
first
professor
of
the
literature
of
the
arts
of
design
in
the
newly
founded
university
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
month
of
july
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
new
buildings
of
the
university
at
washington
square
and
was
henceforth
able
to
devote
more
time
to
his
apparatus
the
same
year
professor
daniell
of
king
college
london
brought
out
his
battery
which
befriended
morse
in
his
experiments
as
it
afterwards
did
cooke
and
wheatstone
hitherto
the
voltaic
battery
had
been
a
source
of
trouble
owing
to
the
current
becoming
weak
as
the
battery
was
kept
in
action
the
length
of
line
through
which
morse
could
work
his
apparatus
was
an
important
point
to
be
determined
for
it
was
known
that
the
current
grows
feebler
in
proportion
to
the
resistance
of
the
wire
it
traverses
morse
saw
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
as
davy
cooke
and
wheatstone
did
by
the
device
known
as
the
relay
were
the
current
too
weak
to
effect
the
marking
of
a
message
it
might
nevertheless
be
sufficiently
strong
to
open
and
close
the
circuit
of
a
local
battery
which
would
print
the
signals
such
relays
and
local
batteries
fixed
at
intervals
along
the
line
as
on
a
turnpike
would
convey
the
message
to
an
immense
distance
i
can
succeed
in
working
a
magnet
ten
miles
said
morse
can
go
round
the
globe
it
matters
not
how
delicate
the
movement
may
be
according
to
his
own
statement
he
devised
the
relay
in
or
earlier
but
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
that
he
explained
the
device
and
showed
the
working
of
his
apparatus
to
his
friend
leonard
gale
professor
of
chemistry
in
the
university
this
gentleman
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
apparatus
and
proved
a
generous
ally
of
the
inventor
until
then
morse
had
only
tried
his
recorder
on
a
few
yards
of
wire
the
battery
was
a
single
pair
of
plates
and
the
was
of
the
elementary
sort
employed
by
moll
and
illustrated
in
the
older
books
the
artist
indeed
was
very
ignorant
of
what
had
been
done
by
other
electricians
and
professor
gale
was
able
to
enlighten
him
when
gale
acquainted
him
with
some
results
in
telegraphing
obtained
by
barlow
he
said
he
was
not
aware
that
anyone
had
even
conceived
the
notion
of
using
the
magnet
for
such
a
purpose
the
researches
of
professor
joseph
henry
on
the
in
were
equally
unknown
to
morse
until
professor
gale
drew
his
attention
to
them
and
in
accordance
with
the
results
suggested
that
the
simple
with
a
few
turns
of
thick
wire
which
he
employed
should
be
replaced
by
one
having
a
coil
of
long
thin
wire
by
this
change
a
much
feebler
current
would
be
able
to
excite
the
magnet
and
the
recorder
would
mark
through
a
greater
length
of
line
henry
himself
in
had
devised
a
telegraph
similar
to
that
of
morse
and
signalled
through
a
mile
of
wire
by
causing
the
armature
of
his
to
strike
a
bell
this
was
virtually
the
first
acoustic
telegraph
american
journal
of
science
the
year
of
the
telegraph
was
an
important
one
for
morse
as
it
was
for
cooke
and
wheatstone
in
the
privacy
of
his
rooms
he
had
constructed
with
his
own
hands
a
model
of
his
apparatus
and
fortune
began
to
favour
him
thanks
to
professor
gale
he
improved
the
employed
a
more
powerful
battery
and
was
thus
able
to
work
through
a
much
longer
line
in
february
the
american
house
of
representatives
passed
a
resolution
asking
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
report
on
the
propriety
of
establishing
a
system
of
telegraphs
for
the
united
states
and
on
march
issued
a
circular
of
inquiry
which
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
inventor
and
probably
urged
him
to
complete
his
apparatus
and
bring
it
under
the
notice
of
the
government
lack
of
mechanical
skill
ignorance
of
electrical
science
as
well
as
want
of
money
had
so
far
kept
it
back
but
the
friend
in
need
whom
he
required
was
nearer
than
he
anticipated
on
saturday
september
while
morse
was
exhibiting
the
model
to
professor
daubeny
of
oxford
then
visiting
the
states
and
others
a
young
man
named
alfred
vail
became
one
of
the
spectators
and
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
results
vail
was
born
in
a
son
of
judge
stephen
vail
master
of
the
speedwell
ironworks
at
morristown
new
jersey
after
leaving
the
village
school
his
father
took
him
and
his
brother
george
into
the
works
but
though
alfred
inherited
a
mechanical
turn
of
mind
he
longed
for
a
higher
sphere
and
on
attaining
to
his
majority
he
resolved
to
enter
the
presbyterian
church
in
he
went
to
the
university
of
the
city
of
new
york
where
he
graduated
in
october
near
the
close
of
the
term
however
his
health
failed
and
he
was
constrained
to
relinquish
his
clerical
aims
while
in
doubts
as
to
his
future
he
chanced
to
see
the
telegraph
and
that
decided
him
he
says
accidentally
and
without
invitation
called
upon
professor
morse
at
the
university
and
found
him
with
professors
torrey
and
daubeny
in
the
mineralogical
cabinet
and
of
professor
gale
where
professor
morse
was
exhibiting
to
these
gentlemen
an
apparatus
which
he
called
his
telegraph
there
were
wires
suspended
in
the
room
running
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
and
returning
many
times
making
a
length
of
seventeen
hundred
feet
the
two
ends
of
the
wire
were
connected
with
an
fastened
to
a
vertical
wooden
frame
in
front
of
the
magnet
was
its
armature
and
also
a
wooden
lever
or
arm
fitted
at
its
extremity
to
hold
a
i
saw
this
instrument
work
and
became
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
principle
of
its
operation
and
i
may
say
struck
with
the
rude
machine
containing
as
i
believed
the
germ
of
what
was
destined
to
produce
great
changes
in
the
conditions
and
relations
of
mankind
i
well
recollect
the
impression
which
was
then
made
upon
my
mind
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
i
lived
in
such
a
day
and
my
mind
contemplated
the
future
in
which
so
grand
and
mighty
an
agent
was
about
to
be
introduced
for
the
benefit
of
the
world
before
leaving
the
room
in
which
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
this
magnificent
invention
i
asked
professor
morse
if
he
intended
to
make
an
experiment
on
a
more
extended
line
of
conductors
he
replied
that
he
did
but
that
he
desired
pecuniary
assistance
to
carry
out
his
plans
i
promised
him
assistance
provided
he
would
admit
me
into
a
share
of
the
invention
to
which
proposition
he
assented
i
then
returned
to
my
locked
the
door
of
my
room
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
and
gave
myself
up
to
reflection
upon
the
mighty
results
which
were
certain
to
follow
the
introduction
of
this
new
agent
in
meeting
and
serving
the
wants
of
the
world
with
the
atlas
in
my
hand
i
traced
the
most
important
lines
which
would
most
certainly
be
erected
in
the
united
states
and
calculated
their
length
the
question
then
rose
in
my
mind
whether
the
could
be
made
to
work
through
the
necessary
lengths
of
line
and
after
much
reflection
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
provided
the
magnet
would
work
even
at
a
distance
of
eight
or
ten
miles
there
could
be
no
risk
in
embarking
in
the
enterprise
and
upon
this
i
decided
in
my
own
mind
to
sink
or
swim
with
it
young
vail
applied
to
his
father
who
was
a
man
of
enterprise
and
intelligence
he
it
was
who
forged
the
shaft
of
the
savannah
the
first
steamship
which
crossed
the
atlantic
morse
was
invited
to
speedwell
with
his
apparatus
that
the
judge
might
see
it
for
himself
and
the
question
of
a
partnership
was
mooted
two
thousand
dollars
were
required
to
procure
the
patents
and
construct
an
instrument
to
bring
before
the
congress
in
spite
of
a
financial
depression
the
judge
was
brave
enough
to
lend
his
assistance
and
on
september
an
agreement
was
signed
between
the
inventor
and
alfred
vail
by
which
the
latter
was
to
construct
at
his
own
expense
a
model
for
exhibition
to
a
committee
of
congress
and
to
secure
the
necessary
patents
for
the
united
states
in
return
vail
was
to
receive
of
the
patent
rights
in
that
country
provision
was
made
also
to
give
vail
an
interest
in
any
foreign
patents
he
might
furnish
means
to
obtain
the
american
patent
was
obtained
by
morse
on
october
he
had
returned
to
new
york
and
was
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
his
dictionary
for
many
months
alfred
vail
worked
in
a
secret
room
at
the
iron
factory
making
the
new
model
his
only
assistant
being
an
apprentice
of
fifteen
william
baxter
who
subsequently
designed
the
baxter
engine
and
died
in
when
the
workshop
was
rebuilt
this
room
was
preserved
as
a
memorial
of
the
telegraph
for
it
was
here
that
the
true
morse
instrument
such
as
we
know
it
was
constructed
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
almost
everything
they
wanted
had
either
to
be
made
by
themselves
or
appropriated
to
their
purpose
their
first
battery
was
set
up
in
a
box
of
parted
into
cells
and
lined
with
their
insulated
wire
was
that
used
by
milliners
for
giving
outline
to
the
bonnets
of
that
day
the
first
machine
made
at
speedwell
was
a
copy
of
that
devised
by
morse
but
as
vail
grew
more
intimate
with
the
subject
his
own
ingenuity
came
into
play
and
he
soon
improved
on
the
original
the
pencil
was
discarded
for
a
fountain
pen
and
the
signals
for
the
short
and
long
lines
now
termed
and
this
important
alteration
led
him
to
the
alphabet
or
code
of
signals
by
which
a
letter
is
transmitted
as
a
group
of
short
and
long
jets
indicated
as
and
on
the
paper
thus
the
letter
e
which
is
so
common
in
english
words
is
now
transmitted
by
a
short
jet
which
makes
a
dot
t
another
common
letter
by
a
long
jet
making
a
dash
and
q
a
rare
letter
by
the
group
dash
dash
dot
dash
vail
tried
to
compute
the
relative
frequency
of
all
the
letters
in
order
to
arrange
his
alphabet
but
a
happy
idea
enabled
him
to
save
his
time
he
went
to
the
office
of
the
local
newspaper
and
found
the
result
he
wanted
in
the
of
the
compositors
the
morse
or
rather
vail
code
is
at
present
the
universal
telegraphic
code
of
symbols
and
its
use
is
extending
to
other
modes
of
example
by
flags
lights
or
trumpets
the
farmers
of
new
jersey
like
many
more
at
that
date
had
no
faith
in
the
machine
and
openly
declared
that
the
judge
had
been
a
fool
for
once
to
put
his
money
in
it
the
judge
on
his
part
wearied
with
the
delay
and
irritated
by
the
sarcasm
of
his
neighbours
grew
dispirited
and
moody
alfred
and
morse
who
had
come
to
assist
were
careful
to
avoid
meeting
him
at
length
on
january
alfred
told
the
apprentice
to
go
up
to
the
house
and
invite
his
father
to
come
down
to
see
the
telegraph
at
work
it
was
a
cold
day
but
the
boy
was
so
eager
that
he
ran
off
without
putting
on
his
coat
in
the
he
found
the
judge
with
his
hat
on
as
if
about
to
go
out
but
seated
before
the
fire
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
and
absorbed
in
gloomy
reflection
william
he
said
looking
up
as
the
boy
entered
and
when
the
message
was
delivered
he
started
to
his
feet
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
standing
in
the
and
the
apparatus
was
explained
calling
for
a
piece
of
paper
he
wrote
upon
it
the
words
patient
waiter
is
no
loser
and
handed
it
to
alfred
with
the
remark
you
can
send
this
and
morse
can
read
it
at
the
other
end
i
shall
be
convinced
the
message
was
transmitted
and
for
a
moment
the
judge
was
fairly
mastered
by
his
feelings
the
apparatus
was
then
exhibited
in
new
york
in
philadelphia
and
subsequently
before
the
committee
of
congress
at
washington
at
first
the
members
of
this
body
were
somewhat
incredulous
about
the
merits
of
the
uncouth
machine
but
the
chairman
the
hon
francis
smith
of
maine
took
an
interest
in
it
and
secured
a
full
attendance
of
the
others
to
see
it
tried
through
ten
miles
of
wire
one
day
in
february
the
demonstration
convinced
them
and
many
were
the
expressions
of
amazement
from
their
lips
some
said
world
is
coming
to
an
end
as
people
will
when
it
is
really
budding
and
putting
forth
symptoms
of
a
larger
life
others
exclaimed
will
improvements
and
discoveries
stop
and
would
jefferson
think
should
he
rise
up
and
witness
what
we
have
just
seen
one
gentleman
declared
that
and
space
are
now
annihilated
the
practical
outcome
of
the
trial
was
that
the
chairman
reported
a
bill
appropriating
dollars
for
the
erection
of
an
experimental
line
between
washington
and
baltimore
smith
was
admitted
to
a
fourth
share
in
the
invention
and
resigned
his
seat
in
congress
to
become
legal
adviser
to
the
inventors
claimants
to
the
invention
of
the
telegraph
now
began
to
spring
up
and
it
was
deemed
advisable
for
smith
and
morse
to
proceed
to
europe
and
secure
the
foreign
patents
alfred
vail
undertook
to
provide
an
instrument
for
exhibition
in
europe
among
these
claimants
was
jackson
chemist
and
geologist
of
boston
who
had
been
instrumental
in
evoking
the
idea
of
the
telegraph
in
the
mind
of
morse
on
board
the
sully
in
a
letter
to
the
new
york
observer
he
went
further
than
this
and
claimed
to
be
a
joint
inventor
but
morse
indignantly
repudiated
the
suggestion
he
declared
that
his
instrument
was
not
mentioned
either
by
him
or
jackson
at
the
time
and
that
they
had
made
no
experiments
together
is
to
professor
gale
that
i
am
most
of
all
indebted
for
substantial
and
effective
aid
in
many
of
my
experiments
he
said
he
prefers
no
claim
of
any
kind
morse
and
smith
arrived
in
london
during
the
month
of
june
application
was
immediately
made
for
a
british
patent
but
cooke
and
wheatstone
and
edward
davy
it
seems
opposed
it
and
although
morse
demonstrated
that
his
was
different
from
theirs
the
patent
was
refused
owing
to
a
prior
publication
in
the
london
mechanics
magazine
for
february
in
the
form
of
an
article
quoted
from
silliman
american
journal
of
science
for
october
morse
did
not
attempt
to
get
this
legal
disqualification
set
aside
in
france
he
was
equally
unfortunate
his
instrument
was
exhibited
by
arago
at
a
meeting
of
the
institute
and
praised
by
humboldt
and
but
the
french
patent
law
requires
the
invention
to
be
at
work
in
france
within
two
years
and
when
morse
arranged
to
erect
a
telegraph
line
on
the
germain
railway
the
government
declined
to
sanction
it
on
the
plea
that
the
telegraph
must
become
a
state
monopoly
all
his
efforts
to
introduce
the
invention
into
europe
were
futile
and
he
returned
disheartened
to
the
united
states
on
april
while
in
paris
he
had
met
daguerre
who
with
niepce
had
just
discovered
the
art
of
photography
the
process
was
communicated
to
morse
who
with
draper
fitted
up
a
studio
on
the
roof
of
the
university
and
took
the
first
daguerreotypes
in
america
the
american
congress
now
seemed
as
indifferent
to
his
inventions
as
the
european
governments
an
exciting
campaign
for
the
presidency
was
at
hand
and
the
proposed
grant
for
the
telegraph
was
forgotten
smith
had
returned
to
the
political
arena
and
the
vails
were
under
a
financial
cloud
so
that
morse
could
expect
no
further
aid
from
them
the
next
two
years
were
the
darkest
he
had
ever
known
tells
us
that
he
had
little
patronage
as
a
professor
and
at
one
time
only
three
pupils
besides
himself
crayon
fee
of
fifty
dollars
for
the
second
quarter
were
overdue
owing
to
his
remittance
from
home
not
arriving
and
one
day
the
professor
said
strother
my
boy
how
are
we
off
for
money
strother
explained
how
he
was
situated
and
stated
that
he
hoped
to
have
the
money
next
week
week
repeated
morse
shall
be
dead
by
that
time
dead
of
starvation
ten
dollars
be
of
any
service
inquired
the
student
both
astonished
and
distressed
dollars
would
save
my
life
replied
morse
and
strother
paid
the
money
which
was
all
he
owned
they
dined
together
and
afterwards
the
professor
remarked
is
my
first
meal
for
hours
strother
do
be
an
artist
it
means
beggary
a
lives
better
the
very
sensitiveness
that
stimulates
an
artist
to
work
keeps
him
alive
to
suffering
towards
the
close
of
he
wrote
to
alfred
vail
have
not
a
cent
in
the
world
and
to
smith
about
the
same
time
he
wrote
find
myself
without
sympathy
or
help
from
any
who
are
associated
with
me
whose
interests
one
would
think
would
impell
them
at
least
to
inquire
if
they
could
render
some
assistance
for
nearly
two
years
past
i
have
devoted
all
my
time
and
scanty
means
living
on
a
mere
pittance
denying
myself
all
pleasures
and
even
necessary
food
that
i
might
have
a
sum
to
put
my
telegraph
into
such
a
position
before
congress
as
to
insure
success
to
the
common
enterprise
i
am
crushed
for
want
of
means
and
means
of
so
trifling
a
character
too
that
they
who
know
how
to
ask
which
i
do
not
could
obtain
in
a
few
hours
as
it
is
although
everything
is
favourable
although
i
have
no
competition
and
no
opposition
on
the
contrary
although
every
member
of
congress
so
far
as
i
can
learn
is
favourable
yet
i
fear
all
will
fail
because
i
am
too
poor
to
risk
the
trifling
expense
which
my
journey
and
residence
in
washington
will
occasion
me
i
will
not
run
into
debt
if
i
lose
the
whole
matter
so
unless
i
have
the
means
from
some
source
i
shall
be
compelled
however
reluctantly
to
leave
it
no
one
call
tell
the
days
and
months
of
anxiety
and
labour
i
have
had
in
perfecting
my
telegraphic
apparatus
for
want
of
means
i
have
been
compelled
to
make
with
my
own
hands
and
to
labour
for
weeks
a
piece
of
mechanism
which
could
be
made
much
better
and
in
a
tenth
part
of
the
time
by
a
good
mechanician
thus
wasting
time
time
which
i
can
not
recall
and
which
seems
to
me
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
it
is
true
and
i
have
known
the
full
meaning
of
it
nothing
but
the
consciousness
that
i
have
an
invention
which
is
to
mark
an
era
in
human
civilisation
and
which
is
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
millions
would
have
sustained
me
through
so
many
and
such
lengthened
trials
of
patience
in
perfecting
it
morse
did
not
invent
for
money
or
scientific
reputation
he
believed
himself
the
instrument
of
a
great
purpose
during
the
summer
of
he
insulated
a
wire
two
miles
long
with
hempen
threads
saturated
with
and
surrounded
with
on
october
during
bright
moonlight
he
submerged
this
wire
in
new
york
harbour
between
castle
garden
and
governor
island
by
unreeling
it
from
a
small
boat
rowed
by
a
man
after
signals
had
been
sent
through
it
the
wire
was
cut
by
an
anchor
and
a
portion
of
it
carried
off
by
sailors
this
appears
to
be
the
first
experiment
in
signalling
on
a
subaqueous
wire
it
was
repeated
on
a
canal
at
washington
the
following
december
and
both
are
described
in
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
december
in
which
morse
states
his
belief
that
communication
on
the
plan
may
with
certainty
be
established
across
the
atlantic
ocean
startling
as
this
may
now
seem
i
am
confident
the
time
will
come
when
the
project
will
be
realised
in
december
the
inventor
made
another
effort
to
obtain
the
help
of
congress
and
the
committee
on
commerce
again
recommended
an
appropriation
of
dollars
in
aid
of
the
telegraph
morse
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
tiresome
by
some
of
the
congressmen
and
they
objected
that
if
the
magnetic
telegraph
were
endowed
mesmerism
or
any
other
might
have
a
claim
on
the
treasury
the
bill
passed
the
house
by
a
slender
majority
of
six
votes
given
orally
some
of
the
representatives
fearing
that
their
support
of
the
measure
would
alienate
their
constituents
its
fate
in
the
senate
was
even
more
dubious
and
when
it
came
up
for
consideration
late
one
night
before
the
adjournment
a
senator
the
hon
fernando
wood
went
to
morse
who
watched
in
the
gallery
and
said
is
no
use
in
your
staying
here
the
senate
is
not
in
sympathy
with
your
project
i
advise
you
to
give
it
up
return
home
and
think
no
more
about
it
morse
retired
to
his
rooms
and
after
paying
his
bill
for
board
including
his
breakfast
the
next
morning
he
found
himself
with
only
cents
and
a
half
in
the
world
kneeling
by
his
he
opened
his
heart
to
god
leaving
the
issue
in
his
hands
and
then
comforted
in
spirit
fell
asleep
while
eating
his
breakfast
next
morning
miss
annie
ellsworth
daughter
of
his
friend
the
hon
henry
ellsworth
commissioner
of
patents
came
up
with
a
beaming
countenance
and
holding
out
her
hand
said
i
have
come
to
congratulate
you
me
replied
morse
what
she
exclaimed
on
the
passage
of
your
bill
by
the
senate
it
had
been
voted
without
debate
at
the
very
close
of
the
session
years
afterwards
morse
declared
that
this
was
the
in
the
history
of
the
telegraph
personal
funds
he
wrote
were
reduced
to
the
fraction
of
a
dollar
and
had
the
passage
of
the
bill
failed
from
any
cause
there
would
have
been
little
prospect
of
another
attempt
on
my
part
to
introduce
to
the
world
my
new
invention
grateful
to
miss
ellsworth
for
bringing
the
good
news
he
declared
that
when
the
washington
to
baltimore
line
was
complete
hers
should
be
the
first
despatch
the
government
now
paid
him
a
salary
of
dollars
a
month
to
superintend
the
laying
of
the
underground
line
which
he
had
decided
upon
professors
gale
and
fisher
became
his
assistants
vail
was
put
in
charge
and
ezra
cornell
who
founded
the
cornell
university
on
the
site
of
the
cotton
mill
where
he
had
worked
as
a
mechanic
and
who
had
invented
a
machine
for
laying
pipes
was
chosen
to
supervise
the
running
of
the
line
the
conductor
was
a
cable
laid
in
pipes
but
after
several
miles
had
been
run
from
baltimore
to
the
house
intended
for
the
relay
the
insulation
broke
down
cornell
it
is
stated
injured
his
machine
to
furnish
an
excuse
for
the
stoppage
of
the
work
the
leaders
consulted
in
secret
for
failure
was
staring
them
in
the
face
some
dollars
of
the
government
grant
were
spent
and
smith
who
had
lost
his
faith
in
the
undertaking
claimed
of
the
remaining
dollars
under
his
contract
for
laying
the
line
a
bitter
quarrel
arose
between
him
and
morse
which
only
ended
in
the
grave
he
opposed
an
additional
grant
from
government
and
morse
in
his
dejection
proposed
to
let
the
patent
expire
and
if
the
government
would
use
his
apparatus
and
remunerate
him
he
would
reward
alfred
vail
while
smith
would
be
deprived
of
his
portion
happily
it
was
decided
to
abandon
the
subterranean
line
and
erect
the
conductor
on
poles
above
the
ground
a
start
was
made
from
the
capitol
washington
on
april
and
the
line
was
carried
to
the
mount
clare
depot
baltimore
on
may
next
morning
miss
ellsworth
fulfilled
her
promise
by
inditing
the
first
message
she
chose
the
words
hath
god
wrought
and
they
were
transmitted
by
morse
from
the
capitol
at
and
received
at
mount
clare
by
alfred
vail
this
was
the
first
message
of
a
public
character
sent
by
the
electric
telegraph
in
the
western
world
and
it
is
preserved
by
the
connecticut
historical
society
the
dots
and
dashes
representing
the
words
were
not
drawn
with
pen
and
ink
but
embossed
on
the
paper
with
a
metal
stylus
the
machine
itself
was
kept
in
the
national
museum
at
washington
and
on
removing
it
in
to
exhibit
it
at
the
morse
memorial
celebration
at
new
york
a
member
of
the
vail
family
discovered
a
folded
paper
attached
to
its
base
a
corner
of
the
writing
was
torn
away
before
its
importance
was
recognised
but
it
proved
to
be
a
signed
statement
by
alfred
vail
to
the
effect
that
the
method
of
embossing
was
invented
by
him
in
the
sixth
storey
of
the
new
york
observer
office
during
prior
to
the
erection
of
the
washington
to
baltimore
line
without
any
hint
from
morse
have
not
asserted
publicly
my
right
as
first
and
sole
inventor
he
says
i
wished
to
preserve
the
peaceful
unity
of
the
invention
and
because
i
could
not
according
to
my
contract
with
professor
morse
have
got
a
patent
for
it
the
powers
of
the
telegraph
having
been
demonstrated
enthusiasm
took
the
place
of
apathy
and
morse
who
had
been
neglected
before
was
in
some
danger
of
being
a
political
incident
spread
the
fame
of
the
telegraph
far
and
wide
the
democratic
convention
sitting
in
baltimore
nominated
james
polk
as
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
silas
wright
for
the
alfred
vail
telegraphed
the
news
to
morse
in
washington
and
he
at
once
told
wright
the
result
was
that
a
few
minutes
later
the
convention
was
dumbfounded
to
receive
a
message
from
wright
declining
to
be
nominated
they
would
not
believe
it
and
appointed
a
committee
to
inquire
into
the
matter
but
the
telegram
was
found
to
be
genuine
on
april
the
baltimore
to
washington
line
was
formally
opened
for
public
business
the
tariff
adopted
by
the
was
one
cent
for
every
four
characters
and
the
receipts
of
the
first
four
days
were
a
single
cent
at
the
end
of
a
week
they
had
risen
to
about
a
dollar
morse
offered
the
invention
to
the
government
for
dollars
but
the
declined
it
on
the
plea
that
its
working
not
satisfied
him
that
under
any
rate
of
postage
that
could
be
adopted
its
revenues
could
be
made
equal
to
its
expenditures
thus
through
the
narrow
views
and
purblindness
of
its
official
the
nation
lost
an
excellent
opportunity
of
keeping
the
telegraph
system
in
its
own
hands
morse
was
disappointed
at
this
refusal
but
it
proved
a
blessing
in
disguise
he
and
his
agent
the
hon
amos
kendall
determined
to
rely
on
private
enterprise
a
line
between
new
york
and
philadelphia
was
projected
and
the
apparatus
was
exhibited
in
broadway
at
a
charge
of
cents
a
head
but
the
did
not
pay
the
expenses
there
was
an
air
of
poverty
about
the
show
one
of
the
exhibitors
slept
on
a
couple
of
chairs
and
the
princely
founder
of
cornell
university
was
grateful
to
providence
for
a
shilling
picked
up
on
the
which
enabled
him
to
enjoy
a
hearty
breakfast
sleek
men
of
capital
looking
with
suspicion
on
the
meagre
furniture
and
miserable
apparatus
withheld
their
patronage
but
humbler
citizens
invested
their
earnings
the
magnetic
telegraph
company
was
incorporated
and
the
line
was
built
the
following
year
another
line
was
run
from
philadelphia
to
baltimore
by
henry
of
rochester
an
acute
pioneer
of
the
telegraph
in
the
course
of
ten
years
the
atlantic
states
were
covered
by
a
straggling
web
of
lines
under
the
control
of
thirty
or
forty
rival
companies
working
different
apparatus
such
as
that
of
morse
bain
house
and
hughes
but
owing
to
various
causes
only
one
or
two
were
paying
a
dividend
it
was
a
fit
moment
for
amalgamation
and
this
was
accomplished
in
by
hiram
sibley
western
union
says
one
in
speaking
of
the
united
corporation
to
me
very
like
collecting
all
the
paupers
in
the
state
and
arranging
them
into
a
union
so
as
to
make
rich
men
of
them
but
crazy
scheme
proved
the
salvation
of
the
competing
companies
in
after
the
first
stage
coach
had
crossed
the
plains
to
california
henry
proposed
to
build
a
line
of
telegraph
and
sibley
urged
the
western
union
to
undertake
it
he
encountered
a
strong
opposition
the
explorations
of
fremont
were
still
fresh
in
the
public
mind
and
the
country
was
regarded
as
a
howling
wilderness
it
was
objected
that
no
poles
could
be
obtained
on
the
prairies
that
the
indians
or
the
buffaloes
would
destroy
the
line
and
that
the
traffic
would
not
pay
gentlemen
said
sibley
you
wo
join
hands
with
me
in
the
thing
i
go
it
alone
he
procured
a
subsidy
from
the
government
who
realised
the
value
of
the
line
from
a
national
point
of
view
the
money
was
raised
under
the
auspices
of
the
western
union
and
the
route
by
omaha
fort
laramie
and
salt
lake
city
to
san
francisco
was
fixed
upon
the
work
began
on
july
and
though
it
was
expected
to
occupy
two
years
it
was
completed
in
four
months
and
eleven
days
the
traffic
soon
became
lucrative
and
the
indians
except
in
time
of
war
protected
the
line
out
of
friendship
for
sibley
a
buck
the
gift
of
white
cloud
spent
its
last
years
in
the
park
of
his
home
at
rochester
the
success
of
the
overland
wire
induced
the
company
to
embark
on
a
still
greater
scheme
the
project
of
perry
macdonough
collins
for
a
trunk
line
between
america
and
europe
by
way
of
british
columbia
alaska
the
aleutian
islands
and
siberia
a
line
already
existed
between
european
russia
and
irkutsk
in
siberia
and
it
was
to
be
extended
to
the
mouth
of
the
amoor
where
the
american
lines
were
to
join
it
two
cables
one
across
behring
sea
and
another
across
the
bay
of
anadyr
were
to
link
the
two
continents
the
expedition
started
in
the
summer
of
with
a
fleet
of
about
thirty
vessels
carrying
telegraph
and
other
stores
in
spite
of
severe
hardships
a
considerable
part
of
the
line
had
been
erected
when
the
successful
completion
of
the
cable
in
caused
the
enterprise
to
be
abandoned
after
an
expenditure
of
dollars
a
trace
cut
for
the
line
through
the
forests
of
british
columbia
is
still
known
as
the
trail
in
spite
of
this
misfortune
the
western
union
telegraph
company
has
continued
to
flourish
in
its
capital
amounted
to
dollars
and
it
now
possesses
a
virtual
monopoly
of
telegraphic
communication
in
the
united
states
morse
did
not
limit
his
connections
to
land
telegraphy
in
when
cyrus
field
brought
out
the
atlantic
telegraph
company
to
lay
a
cable
between
europe
and
america
he
became
its
electrician
and
went
to
england
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
with
the
english
engineers
on
the
execution
of
the
project
but
his
instrument
was
never
used
on
the
ocean
lines
and
indeed
it
was
not
adapted
for
them
during
this
time
alfred
vail
continued
to
improve
the
morse
apparatus
until
it
was
past
recognition
the
and
type
of
the
transmitter
were
discarded
for
a
simple
or
rocking
lever
worked
up
and
down
by
the
hand
so
as
to
make
and
break
the
circuit
the
clumsy
framework
of
the
receiver
was
reduced
to
a
neat
and
portable
size
the
inking
pen
was
replaced
by
a
metal
wheel
or
disc
smeared
with
ink
and
rolling
on
the
paper
at
every
dot
or
dash
vail
as
we
have
seen
also
invented
the
plan
of
embossing
the
message
but
he
did
still
more
when
the
recording
instrument
was
introduced
it
was
found
that
the
clerks
persisted
in
the
signals
by
the
clicking
of
the
marking
lever
and
not
from
the
paper
threats
of
instant
dismissal
did
not
stop
the
practice
when
nobody
was
looking
on
morse
who
regarded
the
record
as
the
distinctive
feature
of
his
invention
was
very
hostile
to
the
practice
but
nature
was
too
many
for
him
the
mode
of
interpreting
by
sound
was
the
easier
and
more
economical
of
the
two
and
vail
with
his
mechanical
instinct
adopted
it
he
produced
an
instrument
in
which
there
is
no
paper
or
marking
device
and
the
message
is
simply
sounded
by
the
lever
of
the
armature
striking
on
its
metal
stops
at
present
the
morse
recorder
is
rarely
used
in
comparison
with
the
the
original
telegraph
of
morse
exhibited
in
has
become
an
archaic
form
apart
from
the
central
idea
of
employing
an
to
signal
an
idea
applied
by
henry
in
when
morse
had
only
thought
of
it
the
development
of
the
apparatus
is
mainly
due
to
vail
his
working
devices
made
it
a
success
and
are
in
use
while
those
of
morse
are
all
extinct
morse
has
been
highly
honoured
and
rewarded
not
only
by
his
countrymen
but
by
the
european
powers
the
queen
of
spain
sent
him
a
cross
of
the
order
of
isabella
the
king
of
prussia
presented
him
with
a
jewelled
the
sultan
of
turkey
decorated
him
with
the
order
of
glory
the
emperor
of
the
french
admitted
him
into
the
legion
of
honour
moreover
the
ten
european
powers
in
special
congress
awarded
him
francs
some
dollars
as
an
expression
of
their
gratitude
honorary
banquets
were
a
common
thing
to
the
man
who
had
almost
starved
through
his
fidelity
to
an
idea
but
beyond
his
emoluments
as
a
partner
in
the
invention
alfred
vail
had
no
recompense
morse
perhaps
was
somewhat
jealous
of
acknowledging
the
services
of
his
assistant
as
he
at
one
time
chose
to
regard
vail
when
personal
friends
knowing
his
services
urged
vail
to
insist
upon
their
recognition
he
replied
am
confident
that
professor
morse
will
do
me
justice
but
even
ten
years
after
the
death
of
vail
on
the
occasion
of
a
banquet
given
in
his
honour
by
the
leading
citizens
of
new
york
morse
alluding
to
his
invention
said
according
to
the
concurrent
testimony
of
many
witnesses
it
lisped
its
first
accents
and
automatically
recorded
them
a
few
blocks
only
distant
from
the
spot
from
which
i
now
address
you
it
was
a
feeble
child
indeed
ungainly
in
its
dress
stammering
in
its
speech
but
it
had
then
all
the
distinctive
features
and
characteristics
of
its
present
manhood
it
found
a
friend
an
efficient
friend
in
alfred
vail
of
new
jersey
who
with
his
father
and
brother
furnished
the
means
to
give
the
child
a
decent
dress
preparatory
to
its
visit
to
the
seat
of
government
when
we
remember
that
even
by
this
time
vail
had
entirely
altered
the
system
of
signals
and
introduced
the
code
we
can
not
but
regard
this
as
a
stinted
acknowledgment
of
his
colleague
work
but
the
man
who
conceives
the
central
idea
and
cherishes
it
is
apt
to
be
niggardly
in
allowing
merit
to
the
assistant
whose
mechanical
skill
is
able
to
shape
and
put
it
in
practice
while
on
the
other
hand
the
assistant
is
sometimes
inclined
to
attach
more
importance
to
the
working
out
than
it
deserves
alfred
vail
can
not
be
charged
with
that
however
and
it
would
have
been
the
more
graceful
on
the
part
of
morse
had
he
avowed
his
indebtedness
to
vail
with
a
greater
liberality
nor
would
this
have
detracted
from
his
own
merit
as
the
originator
and
preserver
of
the
idea
without
which
the
improvements
of
vail
would
have
had
no
existence
in
the
words
of
the
hon
amos
kendall
a
friend
of
both
justice
be
done
the
name
of
alfred
vail
will
for
ever
stand
associated
with
that
of
samuel
morse
in
the
history
and
introduction
into
public
use
of
the
telegraph
professor
morse
spent
his
declining
years
at
locust
grove
a
charming
retreat
on
the
banks
of
the
river
hudson
in
private
life
he
was
a
fine
example
of
the
christian
gentleman
in
the
summer
of
the
telegraphic
brotherhood
of
the
world
erected
a
statue
to
his
honour
in
the
central
park
new
york
delegates
from
different
parts
of
america
were
present
at
the
unveiling
and
in
the
evening
there
was
a
reception
at
the
academy
of
music
where
the
first
recording
telegraph
used
on
the
washington
to
baltimore
line
was
exhibited
the
inventor
himself
appeared
and
sent
a
message
at
a
small
table
which
was
flashed
by
the
connected
wires
to
the
remotest
parts
of
the
union
it
ran
and
thanks
to
the
telegraph
fraternity
throughout
the
world
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
on
earth
peace
goodwill
towards
men
it
was
deemed
fitting
that
morse
should
unveil
the
statue
of
benjamin
franklin
which
had
been
erected
in
printing
house
square
new
york
when
his
venerable
figure
appeared
on
the
platform
and
the
long
white
hair
was
blown
about
his
handsome
face
by
the
winter
wind
a
great
cheer
went
up
from
the
assembled
multitude
but
the
day
was
bitterly
cold
and
the
exposure
cost
him
his
life
some
months
later
as
he
lay
on
his
sick
bed
he
observed
to
the
doctor
best
is
yet
to
come
in
tapping
his
chest
one
day
the
physician
said
this
is
the
way
we
doctors
telegraph
professor
and
morse
replied
with
a
smile
good
very
good
these
were
his
last
words
he
died
at
new

on
april
at
the
age
of
years

was
buried
in

thomson
sir
william
thomson
the
greatest
physicist
of
the
age
and
the
highest
authority
on
electrical
science
theoretical
and
applied
was
born
at
belfast
on
june
his
father
james
thomson
the
son
of
a
farmer
showed
a
bent
for
scholarship
when
a
boy
and
became
a
pupil
teacher
in
a
small
school
near
ballynahinch
in
county
down
with
his
summer
earnings
he
educated
himself
at
glasgow
university
during
winter
appointed
head
master
of
a
school
in
connection
with
the
royal
academical
institute
he
subsequently
obtained
the
professorship
of
mathematics
in
that
academy
in
he
was
called
to
the
chair
of
mathematics
in
the
university
of
glasgow
where
he
achieved
a
reputation
by
his
on
arithmetic
and
mathematics
william
began
his
course
at
the
same
college
in
his
eleventh
year
and
was
petted
by
the
older
students
for
his
extraordinary
quickness
in
solving
the
problems
of
his
father
class
it
was
quite
plain
that
his
genius
lay
in
the
direction
of
mathematics
and
on
finishing
at
glasgow
he
was
sent
to
the
higher
mathematical
school
of
peter
college
cambridge
in
he
graduated
as
second
wrangler
but
won
the
smith
prize
this
stakes
is
regarded
as
a
better
test
of
originality
than
the
tripos
the
first
or
senior
wrangler
probably
beat
him
by
a
facility
in
applying
rules
and
a
readiness
in
writing
one
of
the
examiners
is
said
to
have
declared
that
he
was
unworthy
to
cut
thomson
pencils
it
is
certain
that
while
the
victor
has
been
forgotten
the
vanquished
has
created
a
renown
while
at
cambridge
he
took
an
active
part
in
the
field
sports
and
athletics
of
the
university
he
won
the
silver
sculls
and
rowed
in
the
winning
boat
of
the
oxford
and
cambridge
race
he
also
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
classics
in
music
and
in
general
literature
but
the
real
love
the
central
passion
of
his
intellectual
life
was
the
pursuit
of
science
the
study
of
mathematics
physics
and
in
particular
of
electricity
had
captivated
his
imagination
and
soon
engrossed
all
the
teeming
faculties
of
his
mind
at
the
age
of
seventeen
when
ordinary
lads
are
fond
of
games
and
the
cleverer
sort
are
content
to
learn
without
attempting
to
originate
young
thomson
had
begun
to
make
investigations
the
cambridge
mathematical
journal
of
contains
a
paper
by
him
the
uniform
motion
of
heat
in
homogeneous
solid
bodies
and
its
connection
with
the
mathematical
theory
of
electricity
in
this
he
demonstrated
the
identity
of
the
laws
governing
the
distribution
of
electric
or
magnetic
force
in
general
with
the
laws
governing
the
distribution
of
the
lines
of
the
motion
of
heat
in
certain
special
cases
the
paper
was
followed
by
others
on
the
mathematical
theory
of
electricity
and
in
he
gave
the
first
mathematical
development
of
faraday
notion
that
electric
induction
takes
place
through
an
intervening
medium
or
and
not
by
some
incomprehensible
at
a
distance
he
also
devised
an
hypothesis
of
electrical
images
which
became
a
powerful
agent
in
solving
problems
of
electrostatics
or
the
science
which
deals
with
the
forces
of
electricity
at
rest
on
gaining
a
fellowship
at
his
college
he
spent
some
time
in
the
laboratory
of
the
celebrated
regnault
at
paris
but
in
he
was
appointed
to
the
chair
of
natural
philosophy
in
the
university
of
glasgow
it
was
due
to
the
brilliant
promise
he
displayed
as
much
as
to
the
influence
of
his
father
that
at
the
age
of
he
found
himself
wearing
the
gown
of
a
learned
professor
in
one
of
the
oldest
universities
in
the
country
and
lecturing
to
the
class
of
which
he
was
a
freshman
but
a
few
years
before
thomson
became
a
man
of
public
note
in
connection
with
the
laying
of
the
first
atlantic
cable
after
cooke
and
wheatstone
had
introduced
their
working
telegraph
in
the
idea
of
a
submarine
line
across
the
atlantic
ocean
began
to
dawn
on
the
minds
of
men
as
a
possible
triumph
of
the
future
morse
proclaimed
his
faith
in
it
as
early
as
the
year
and
in
he
submerged
a
wire
insulated
with
tarred
hemp
and
in
the
water
of
new
york
harbour
and
telegraphed
through
it
the
following
autumn
wheatstone
performed
a
similar
experiment
in
the
bay
of
swansea
a
good
insulator
to
cover
the
wire
and
prevent
the
electricity
from
leaking
into
the
water
was
requisite
for
the
success
of
a
long
submarine
line
had
been
tried
by
jacobi
the
russian
electrician
as
far
back
as
he
laid
a
wire
insulated
with
rubber
across
the
neva
at
petersburg
and
succeeded
in
firing
a
mine
by
an
electric
spark
sent
through
it
but
although
it
is
now
used
to
a
considerable
extent
was
not
easy
to
manipulate
in
those
days
luckily
another
gum
which
could
be
melted
by
heat
and
readily
applied
to
the
wire
made
its
appearance
the
adhesive
juice
of
the
isonandra
gutta
tree
was
introduced
to
europe
in
by
montgomerie
a
scotch
surveyor
in
the
service
of
the
east
india
company
twenty
years
before
he
had
seen
whips
made
of
it
in
singapore
and
believed
that
it
would
be
useful
in
the
fabrication
of
surgical
apparatus
faraday
and
wheatstone
soon
discovered
its
merits
as
an
insulator
and
in
the
latter
suggested
that
it
should
be
employed
to
cover
the
wire
which
it
was
proposed
to
lay
from
dover
to
calais
it
was
tried
on
a
wire
laid
across
the
rhine
between
deutz
and
cologne
in
walker
electrician
to
the
south
eastern
railway
company
submerged
a
wire
coated
with
it
or
as
it
is
technically
called
a
core
along
the
coast
off
dover
the
following
year
john
watkins
brett
laid
the
first
line
across
the
channel
it
was
simply
a
copper
wire
coated
with
without
any
other
protection
the
core
was
payed
out
from
a
reel
mounted
behind
the
funnel
of
a
steam
tug
the
goliath
and
sunk
by
means
of
lead
weights
attached
to
it
every
sixteenth
of
a
mile
she
left
dover
about
ten
on
the
morning
of
august
with
some
thirty
men
on
board
and
a
day
provisions
the
route
she
was
to
follow
was
marked
by
a
line
of
buoys
and
flags
by
eight
in
the
evening
she
arrived
at
cape
grisnez
and
came
to
anchor
near
the
shore
brett
watched
the
operations
through
a
glass
at
dover
declining
sun
he
says
me
to
discern
the
moving
shadow
of
the
steamer
smoke
on
the
white
cliff
thus
indicating
her
progress
at
length
the
shadow
ceased
to
move
the
vessel
had
evidently
come
to
an
anchor
we
gave
them
half
an
hour
to
convey
the
end
of
the
wire
to
shore
and
attach
the
instrument
and
then
i
sent
the
first
electrical
message
across
the
channel
this
was
reserved
for
louis
napoleon
according
to
webb
however
the
first
of
the
signals
were
a
mere
jumble
of
letters
which
were
torn
up
he
saved
a
specimen
of
the
slip
on
which
they
were
printed
and
it
was
afterwards
presented
to
the
duke
of
wellington
next
morning
this
pioneer
line
was
broken
down
at
a
point
about
yards
from
cape
grisnez
and
it
turned
out
that
a
boulogne
fisherman
had
raised
it
on
his
trawl
and
cut
a
piece
away
thinking
he
had
found
a
rare
species
of
tangle
with
gold
in
its
heart
this
misfortune
suggested
the
propriety
of
arming
the
core
against
mechanical
injury
by
sheathing
it
in
a
cable
of
hemp
and
iron
wires
the
experiment
served
to
keep
alive
the
concession
and
the
next
year
on
november
a
protected
core
or
true
cable
was
laid
from
a
government
hulk
the
blazer
which
was
towed
across
the
channel
next
year
great
britain
and
ireland
were
linked
together
in
may
england
was
joined
to
holland
by
a
cable
across
the
north
sea
from
orfordness
to
the
hague
it
was
laid
by
the
monarch
a
paddle
steamer
which
had
been
fitted
for
the
work
during
the
night
she
met
with
such
heavy
weather
that
the
engineer
was
lashed
near
the
brakes
and
the
electrician
latimer
clark
sent
the
continuity
signals
by
jerking
a
needle
instrument
with
a
string
these
and
other
efforts
in
the
mediterranean
and
elsewhere
were
the
harbingers
of
the
memorable
enterprise
which
bound
the
old
world
and
the
new
bishop
mullock
head
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
newfoundland
was
lying
becalmed
in
his
yacht
one
day
in
sight
of
cape
breton
island
and
began
to
dream
of
a
plan
for
uniting
his
savage
diocese
to
the
mainland
by
a
line
of
telegraph
through
the
forest
from
john
to
cape
ray
and
cables
across
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
from
cape
ray
to
nova
scotia
john
was
an
atlantic
port
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
passage
of
news
between
america
and
europe
could
thus
be
shortened
by
hours
on
returning
to
john
he
published
his
idea
in
the
courier
by
a
letter
dated
november
about
the
same
time
a
similar
plan
occurred
to
gisborne
a
telegraph
engineer
in
nova
scotia
in
the
spring
of
he
procured
a
grant
from
the
legislature
of
newfoundland
resigned
his
situation
in
nova
scotia
and
having
formed
a
company
began
the
construction
of
the
land
line
but
in
his
bills
were
dishonoured
by
the
company
he
was
arrested
for
debt
and
stripped
of
all
his
fortune
the
following
year
however
he
was
introduced
to
cyrus
field
of
new
york
a
wealthy
merchant
who
had
just
returned
from
a
six
months
tour
in
south
america
field
invited
gisborne
to
his
house
in
order
to
discuss
the
project
when
his
visitor
was
gone
field
began
to
turn
over
a
terrestrial
globe
which
stood
in
his
library
and
it
flashed
upon
him
that
the
telegraph
to
newfoundland
might
be
extended
across
the
atlantic
ocean
the
idea
fired
him
with
enthusiasm
it
seemed
worthy
of
a
ambition
and
although
he
had
retired
from
business
to
spend
his
days
in
peace
he
resolved
to
dedicate
his
time
his
energies
and
fortune
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
grand
enterprise
a
presentiment
of
success
may
have
inspired
him
but
he
was
ignorant
alike
of
submarine
cables
and
the
deep
sea
was
it
possible
to
submerge
the
cable
in
the
atlantic
and
would
it
be
safe
at
the
bottom
again
would
the
messages
travel
through
the
line
fast
enough
to
make
it
pay
on
the
first
question
he
consulted
lieutenant
maury
the
great
authority
on
mareography
maury
told
him
that
according
to
recent
soundings
by
lieutenant
berryman
of
the
united
states
brig
dolphin
the
bottom
between
ireland
and
newfoundland
was
a
plateau
covered
with
microscopic
shells
at
a
depth
not
over
fathoms
and
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
the
very
purpose
of
receiving
the
cable
he
left
the
question
of
finding
a
time
calm
enough
the
sea
smooth
enough
a
wire
long
enough
and
a
ship
big
enough
to
lay
a
line
some
sixteen
hundred
miles
in
length
to
other
minds
as
to
the
line
itself
field
consulted
professor
morse
who
assured
him
that
it
was
quite
possible
to
make
and
lay
a
cable
of
that
length
he
at
once
adopted
the
scheme
of
gisborne
as
a
preliminary
step
to
the
vaster
undertaking
and
promoted
the
new
york
newfoundland
and
london
telegraph
company
to
establish
a
line
of
telegraph
between
america
and
europe
professor
morse
was
appointed
electrician
to
the
company
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
finish
the
line
between
john
and
nova
scotia
and
in
an
attempt
was
made
to
lay
a
cable
across
the
gulf
of
the
lawrence
it
was
payed
out
from
a
barque
in
tow
of
a
steamer
but
when
half
was
laid
a
gale
rose
and
to
keep
the
barque
from
sinking
the
line
was
cut
away
next
summer
a
steamboat
was
fitted
out
for
the
purpose
and
the
cable
was
submerged
john
was
now
connected
with
new
york
by
a
thousand
miles
of
land
and
submarine
telegraph
field
then
directed
his
efforts
to
the
completion
of
the
section
he
induced
the
american
government
to
despatch
lieutenant
berryman
in
the
arctic
and
the
british
admiralty
to
send
lieutenant
dayman
in
the
cyclops
to
make
a
special
survey
along
the
proposed
route
of
the
cable
these
soundings
revealed
the
existence
of
a
submarine
hill
dividing
the
plateau
from
the
shoal
water
on
the
coast
of
ireland
but
its
slope
was
gradual
and
easy
till
now
the
enterprise
had
been
purely
american
and
the
funds
provided
by
american
capitalists
with
the
exception
of
a
few
shares
held
by
brett
but
seeing
that
the
cable
was
to
land
on
british
soil
it
was
fitting
that
the
work
should
be
international
and
that
the
british
people
should
be
asked
to
contribute
towards
the
manufacture
and
submersion
of
the
cable
field
therefore
proceeded
to
london
and
with
the
assistance
of
brett
the
atlantic
telegraph
company
was
floated
field
himself
supplied
a
quarter
of
the
needed
capital
and
we
may
add
that
lady
byron
and
thackeray
the
novelist
were
among
the
shareholders
the
design
of
the
cable
was
a
subject
of
experiment
by
professor
morse
and
others
it
was
known
that
the
conductor
should
be
of
copper
possessing
a
high
conductivity
for
the
electric
current
and
that
its
insulating
jacket
of
should
offer
a
great
resistance
to
the
leakage
of
the
current
moreover
experience
had
shown
that
the
protecting
sheath
or
armour
of
the
core
should
be
light
and
flexible
as
well
as
strong
in
order
to
resist
external
violence
and
allow
it
to
be
lifted
for
repair
there
was
another
consideration
however
which
at
this
time
was
rather
a
puzzle
as
early
as
afterwards
sir
francis
ronalds
had
observed
that
electric
signals
were
retarded
in
passing
through
an
insulated
wire
or
core
laid
under
ground
and
the
same
effect
was
noticeable
on
cores
immersed
in
water
and
particularly
on
the
lengthy
cable
between
england
and
the
hague
faraday
showed
that
it
was
caused
by
induction
between
the
electricity
in
the
wire
and
the
earth
or
water
surrounding
it
a
core
in
fact
is
an
attenuated
leyden
jar
the
wire
of
the
core
its
insulating
jacket
and
the
soil
or
water
around
it
stand
respectively
for
the
inner
tinfoil
the
glass
and
the
outer
tinfoil
of
the
jar
when
the
wire
is
charged
from
a
battery
the
electricity
induces
an
opposite
charge
in
the
water
as
it
travels
along
and
as
the
two
charges
attract
each
other
the
exciting
charge
is
restrained
the
speed
of
a
signal
through
the
conductor
of
a
submarine
cable
is
thus
diminished
by
a
drag
of
its
own
making
the
nature
of
the
phenomenon
was
clear
but
the
laws
which
governed
it
were
still
a
mystery
it
became
a
serious
question
whether
on
a
long
cable
such
as
that
required
for
the
atlantic
the
signals
might
not
be
so
sluggish
that
the
work
would
hardly
pay
faraday
had
said
to
field
that
a
signal
would
take
a
second
and
the
american
was
satisfied
but
professor
thomson
enunciated
the
law
of
retardation
and
cleared
up
the
whole
matter
he
showed
that
the
velocity
of
a
signal
through
a
given
core
was
inversely
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
length
of
the
core
that
is
to
say
in
any
particular
cable
the
speed
of
a
signal
is
diminished
to
if
the
length
is
doubled
to
if
it
is
trebled
to
if
it
is
quadrupled
and
so
on
it
was
now
possible
to
calculate
the
time
taken
by
a
signal
in
traversing
the
proposed
atlantic
line
to
a
minute
fraction
of
a
second
and
to
design
the
proper
core
for
a
cable
of
any
given
length
the
accuracy
of
thomson
law
was
disputed
in
by
edward
wildman
whitehouse
the
electrician
of
the
atlantic
telegraph
company
who
had
misinterpreted
the
results
of
his
own
experiments
thomson
disposed
of
his
contention
in
a
letter
to
the
athenaeum
and
the
directors
of
the
company
saw
that
he
was
a
man
to
enlist
in
their
adventure
it
is
not
enough
to
say
the
young
glasgow
professor
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
their
work
he
descended
in
their
midst
like
the
very
genius
of
electricity
and
helped
them
out
of
all
their
difficulties
in
he
published
in
the
engineer
the
whole
theory
of
the
mechanical
forces
involved
in
the
laying
of
a
submarine
cable
and
showed
that
when
the
line
is
running
out
of
the
ship
at
a
constant
speed
in
a
uniform
depth
of
water
it
sinks
in
a
slant
or
straight
incline
from
the
point
where
it
enters
the
water
to
that
where
it
touches
the
bottom
to
these
gifts
of
theory
electrical
and
mechanical
thomson
added
a
practical
boon
in
the
shape
of
the
reflecting
galvanometer
or
mirror
instrument
this
measurer
of
the
current
was
infinitely
more
sensitive
than
any
which
preceded
it
and
enables
the
electrician
to
detect
the
slightest
flaw
in
the
core
of
a
cable
during
its
manufacture
and
submersion
moreover
it
proved
the
best
apparatus
for
receiving
the
messages
through
a
long
cable
the
morse
and
other
instruments
however
suitable
for
land
lines
and
short
cables
were
all
but
useless
on
the
atlantic
line
owing
to
the
retardation
of
the
signals
but
the
mirror
instrument
sprang
out
of
thomson
study
of
this
phenomenon
and
was
designed
to
match
it
hence
this
instrument
through
being
the
fittest
for
the
purpose
drove
the
others
from
the
field
and
allowed
the
first
atlantic
cables
to
be
worked
on
a
profitable
basis
the
cable
consisted
of
a
strand
of
seven
copper
wires
one
weighing
pounds
a
nautical
mile
or
knot
covered
with
three
coats
of
weighing
pounds
a
knot
and
wound
with
tarred
hemp
over
which
a
sheath
of
eighteen
strands
each
of
seven
iron
wires
was
laid
in
a
close
spiral
it
weighed
nearly
a
ton
to
the
mile
was
flexible
as
a
rope
and
able
to
withstand
a
pull
of
several
tons
it
was
made
conjointly
by
glass
elliot
of
greenwich
and
newall
of
liverpool
the
british
government
promised
field
a
subsidy
of
a
year
and
the
loan
of
ships
to
lay
the
cable
he
solicited
an
equal
help
from
congress
but
a
large
number
of
the
senators
actuated
by
a
national
jealousy
of
england
and
looking
to
the
fact
that
both
ends
of
the
line
were
to
lie
in
british
territory
opposed
the
grant
it
appeared
to
these
politicians
that
england
the
hereditary
foe
was
crawling
under
the
sea
to
get
some
advantage
over
the
united
states
the
bill
was
only
passed
by
a
majority
of
a
single
vote
in
the
house
of
representatives
it
encountered
a
similar
hostility
but
was
ultimately
signed
by
president
pierce
the
agamemnon
a
british
fitted
out
for
the
purpose
took
in
the
section
made
at
greenwich
and
the
niagara
an
american
warship
that
made
at
liverpool
the
vessels
and
their
consorts
met
in
the
bay
of
valentia
island
on
the
coast
of
ireland
where
on
august
the
shore
end
of
the
cable
was
landed
from
the
niagara
it
was
a
memorable
scene
the
ships
in
the
bay
were
dressed
in
bunting
and
the
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
stood
on
the
beach
attended
by
his
following
to
receive
the
end
from
the
american
sailors
visitors
in
holiday
attire
collected
in
groups
to
watch
the
operations
and
eagerly
joined
with
his
excellency
in
helping
to
pull
the
wire
ashore
when
it
was
landed
the
reverend
day
of
kenmore
offered
up
a
prayer
asking
the
almighty
to
prosper
the
undertaking
next
day
the
expedition
sailed
but
ere
the
niagara
had
proceeded
five
miles
on
her
way
the
parted
and
the
repairing
of
it
delayed
the
start
for
another
day
at
first
the
niagara
went
slowly
ahead
to
avoid
a
mishap
but
as
the
cable
ran
out
easily
she
increased
her
speed
the
night
fell
but
hardly
a
soul
slept
the
utmost
vigilance
was
maintained
throughout
the
vessel
apart
from
the
noise
of
the
machinery
there
was
an
awful
stillness
on
board
men
walked
about
with
a
muffled
step
or
spoke
in
whispers
as
if
they
were
afraid
the
sound
of
their
voices
would
break
the
slender
line
it
seemed
as
though
a
great
and
valued
friend
lay
at
the
point
of
death
the
submarine
hill
with
its
dangerous
slope
was
passed
in
safety
and
the
plateau
nearly
two
miles
deep
was
reached
when
suddenly
the
signals
from
ireland
which
told
that
the
conductor
was
intact
stopped
altogether
professor
morse
and
de
sauty
the
electricians
failed
to
restore
the
communication
and
the
engineers
were
preparing
to
cut
the
cable
when
quite
as
suddenly
the
signals
returned
and
every
face
grew
bright
a
old
sailor
said
have
watched
nearly
every
mile
of
it
as
it
came
over
the
side
and
i
would
have
given
fifty
dollars
poor
man
as
i
am
to
have
saved
it
although
i
do
expect
to
make
anything
by
it
when
it
is
laid
down
but
the
joy
was
the
line
was
running
out
at
the
rate
of
six
miles
an
hour
while
the
vessel
was
only
making
four
to
check
this
waste
of
cable
the
engineer
tightened
the
brakes
but
as
the
stern
of
the
ship
rose
on
the
swell
the
cable
parted
under
the
heavy
strain
and
the
end
was
lost
in
the
sea
the
bad
news
ran
like
a
flash
of
lightning
through
all
the
ships
and
produced
a
feeling
of
sorrow
and
dismay
no
attempt
was
made
to
grapple
the
line
in
such
deep
water
and
the
expedition
returned
to
england
it
was
too
late
to
try
again
that
year
but
the
following
summer
the
agamemnon
and
niagara
after
an
experimental
trip
to
the
bay
of
biscay
sailed
from
plymouth
on
june
with
a
full
supply
of
cable
better
gear
than
before
and
a
riper
experience
of
the
work
they
were
to
meet
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
where
the
two
halves
of
the
cable
on
board
of
each
were
to
be
spliced
together
and
while
the
agamemnon
payed
out
eastwards
to
valentia
island
the
niagara
was
to
pay
out
westward
to
newfoundland
on
her
way
to
the
rendezvous
the
agamemnon
encountered
a
terrific
gale
which
lasted
for
a
week
and
nearly
proved
her
destruction
on
saturday
the
the
middle
splice
was
effected
and
the
bight
dropped
into
the
deep
the
two
ships
got
under
weigh
but
had
not
proceeded
three
miles
when
the
cable
broke
in
the
machinery
of
the
niagara
another
splice
followed
by
a
fresh
start
was
made
during
the
same
afternoon
but
when
some
fifty
miles
were
payed
out
of
each
vessel
the
current
which
kept
up
communication
between
them
suddenly
failed
owing
to
the
cable
having
snapped
in
the
sea
once
more
the
middle
splice
was
made
and
lowered
and
the
ships
parted
company
a
third
time
for
a
day
or
two
all
went
well
over
two
hundred
miles
of
cable
ran
smoothly
out
of
each
vessel
and
the
anxious
chiefs
began
to
indulge
in
hopes
of
ultimate
success
when
the
cable
broke
about
twenty
feet
behind
the
stern
of
the
agamemnon
the
expedition
returned
to
queenstown
and
a
consultation
took
place
field
and
professor
thomson
who
was
on
board
the
agamemnon
were
in
favour
of
another
trial
and
it
was
decided
to
make
one
without
delay
the
vessels
left
the
cove
of
cork
on
july
but
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
public
enthusiasm
and
even
those
on
board
felt
as
if
they
were
going
on
another
wild
goose
chase
the
agamemnon
was
now
almost
becalmed
on
her
way
to
the
rendezvous
but
the
middle
splice
was
finished
by
on
july
and
immediately
dropped
into
the
sea
the
ships
thereupon
started
and
increased
their
distance
while
the
cable
ran
easily
out
of
them
some
alarm
was
caused
by
the
stoppage
of
the
continuity
signals
but
after
a
time
they
reappeared
the
niagara
deviated
from
the
great
arc
of
a
circle
on
which
the
cable
was
to
be
laid
and
the
error
was
traced
to
the
iron
of
the
cable
influencing
her
compass
hence
the
gorgon
one
of
her
consorts
was
ordered
to
go
ahead
and
lead
the
way
the
niagara
passed
several
icebergs
but
none
injured
the
cable
and
on
august
she
arrived
in
trinity
bay
newfoundland
at
next
morning
the
shore
end
was
landed
into
the
which
had
been
built
for
its
reception
captain
hudson
of
the
niagara
then
read
prayers
and
at
one
gorgon
fired
a
salute
of
guns
the
agamemnon
made
an
equally
successful
run
about
six
on
the
first
evening
a
huge
whale
was
seen
approaching
on
the
starboard
bow
and
as
he
sported
in
the
waves
rolling
and
lashing
them
into
foam
the
onlookers
began
to
fear
that
he
might
endanger
the
line
their
excitement
became
intense
as
the
monster
heaved
astern
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
cable
until
his
body
grazed
it
where
it
sank
into
the
water
but
happily
no
harm
was
done
damaged
portions
of
the
cable
had
to
be
removed
in
and
the
stoppage
of
the
continuity
signals
raised
other
alarms
on
board
strong
head
winds
kept
the
agamemnon
back
and
two
american
ships
which
got
into
her
course
had
to
be
warned
off
by
firing
guns
the
signals
from
the
niagara
became
very
weak
but
on
professor
thomson
asking
the
electricians
on
board
of
her
to
increase
their
battery
power
they
improved
at
once
at
length
on
thursday
august
the
agamemnon
with
her
consort
the
valorous
arrived
at
valentia
island
and
the
shore
end
was
landed
into
the
at
knightstown
by
and
a
royal
salute
announced
the
completion
of
the
work
the
news
was
received
at
first
with
some
incredulity
but
on
being
confirmed
it
caused
a
universal
joy
on
august
queen
victoria
sent
a
telegram
of
congratulation
to
president
buchanan
through
the
line
and
expressed
a
hope
that
it
would
prove

the
president
responded
that
is
a
triumph
more
glorious
because
far
more
useful
to
mankind
than
was
ever
won
by
conqueror
on

may
the

between
the

and
an
instrument
destined
by
divine
providence
to
diffuse
religion
civilisation
liberty
and

throughout
the

these
messages
were
the
signal
for
a
fresh
outburst
of
enthusiasm
next
morning
a
grand
salute
of
guns
resounded
in
new
york
the
streets
were
decorated
with
flags
the
bells
of
the
churches
rung
and
at
night
the
city
was
illuminated
the
atlantic
cable
was
a
theme
of
inspiration
for
innumerable
sermons
and
a
prodigious
quantity
of
doggerel
among
the
happier
lines
were
these
tis

the
angry

consents
the
nations
stand
no
more
apart
with
clasped

the
continents
feel
throbbings
of
each

heart
speed
speed
the

let
it
run
a
loving
girdle
round
the

till
all
the

the

shall

one

the
rejoicing
reached
a
climax
in
september
when
a
public
service
was
held
in
trinity
church
and
field
the
hero
of
the
hour
as
head
and
mainspring
of
the
expedition
received
an
ovation
in
the
crystal
palace
at
new
york
the
mayor
presented
him
with
a
golden
casket
as
a
souvenir
of
grandest
enterprise
of
our
day
and
generation
the
band
played
save
the
queen
and
the
whole
audience
rose
to
their
feet
in
the
evening
there
was
a
magnificent
torchlight
procession
of
the
city
firemen
that
very
day
the
cable
breathed
its
last
its
insulation
had
been
failing
for
some
days
and
the
only
signals
which
could
be
read
were
those
given
by
the
mirror
galvanometer
it
is
said
to
have
broken
down
while
newfoundland
was
vainly
attempting
to
inform
valentia
that
it
was
sending
with
three
hundred
and
twelve
cells
the
reaction
at
this
news
was
tremendous
some
writers
even
hinted
that
the
line
was
a
mere
hoax
and
others
pronounced
it
a
stock
exchange
speculation
sensible
men
doubted
whether
the
cable
had
ever
but
in
addition
to
the
royal
despatch
items
of
daily
news
had
passed
through
the
wire
for
instance
the
announcement
of
a
collision
between
two
ships
the
arabia
and
the
europa
off
cape
race
newfoundland
and
an
order
from
london
countermanding
the
departure
of
a
regiment
in
canada
for
the
seat
of
the
indian
mutiny
which
had
come
to
an
end
field
was
by
no
means
daunted
at
the
failure
he
was
even
more
eager
to
renew
the
work
since
he
had
come
so
near
to
success
but
the
public
had
lost
confidence
in
the
scheme
and
all
his
efforts
to
revive
the
company
were
futile
it
was
not
until
that
with
the
assistance
of
thomas
afterwards
lord
brassey
and
now
sir
john
fender
that
he
succeeded
in
raising
the
necessary
capital
the
glass
elliot
and
companies
were
united
to
form
the
telegraph
construction
and
maintenance
company
which
undertook
to
manufacture
and
lay
the
new
cable
much
experience
had
been
gained
in
the
meanwhile
long
cables
had
been
submerged
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
red
sea
the
board
of
trade
in
had
appointed
a
committee
of
experts
including
professor
wheatstone
to
investigate
the
whole
subject
and
the
results
were
published
in
a
profiting
by
these
aids
an
improved
type
of
cable
was
designed
the
core
consisted
of
a
strand
of
seven
very
pure
copper
wires
weighing
lbs
a
knot
coated
with
compound
which
is
impervious
to
water
then
covered
with
four
layers
of
alternating
with
four
thin
layers
of
the
compound
cementing
the
whole
and
bringing
the
weight
of
the
insulator
to
lbs
per
knot
this
core
was
served
with
hemp
saturated
in
a
preservative
solution
and
on
the
hemp
as
a
padding
were
spirally
wound
eighteen
single
wires
of
soft
steel
each
covered
with
fine
strands
of
manilla
yam
steeped
in
the
preservative
the
weight
of
the
new
cable
was
cwt
per
knot
or
nearly
twice
the
weight
of
the
old
and
it
was
stronger
in
proportion
ten
years
before
marc
isambard
brunel
the

the

all
went
well
until
next
morning
early
when
the
boom
of
a
gun
signalled
that
a
fault
had
broken
out
in
the

it
turned
out
that
a
splinter
of
iron
wire
had
penetrated
the
core
more
faults
of
the
kind
were
discovered
and
as
they
always
happened
in
the
same
watch
there
was
a
suspicion
of
foul
play
in
repairing
one
of
these
on
july
after
miles
had
been
payed
out
the

snapped
near

recover
it
the

steamed
back
to

where
the

cited
these

in
the

is
a
great
work
a
glory
to
our
age

thanks
for
the
success
of
the

congratulations
poured
in
and
friendly
telegrams
were
again
exchanged
between

the
great
work
had
been
finally
accomplished
and
the
two
worlds
were
lastingly
united
on
august
the
great
eastern
put
to
sea
again
in
order
to
grapple
the
lost
cable
of
and
complete
it
to
newfoundland
arriving
in
she
proceeded
to
fish
for
the
submerged
line
in
two
thousand
fathoms
of
water
and
after
repeated
failures
involving
thirty
casts
of
the
grapnel
she
hooked
and
raised
it
to
surface
then
spliced
it
to
the
fresh
cable
in
her
hold
and
payed
out
to
heart
content
where
she
arrived
on
saturday
september
there
were
now
two
fibres
of
intelligence
between
the
two
hemispheres
on
his
return
home
professor
thomson
was
among
those
who
received
the
honour
of
knighthood
for
their
services
in
connection
with
the
enterprise
he
deserved
it
by
his
theory
and
apparatus
he
probably
did
more
than
any
other
man
with
the
exception
of
field
to
further
the
atlantic
telegraph
we
owe
it
to
his
admirable
inventions
the
mirror
instrument
of
and
the
siphon
recorder
of
that
messages
through
long
cables
are
so
cheap
and
fast
and
as
a
consequence
that
ocean
telegraphy
is
now
so
common
hence
some
account
of
these
two
instruments
will
not
be
out
of
place
sir
william
thomson
siphon
recorder
in
all
its
present
completeness
must
take
rank
as
a
masterpiece
of
invention
as
used
in
the
recording
or
writing
in
permanent
characters
of
the
messages
sent
through
long
submarine
cables
it
is
the
acknowledged
chief
of
instruments
as
those
apparatus
are
called
which
interpret
the
electrical
condition
of
the
telegraph
wire
into
intelligible
signals
like
other
mechanical
creations
no
doubt
its
growth
in
idea
and
translation
into
material
fact
was
a
process
of
evolution
culminating
at
last
in
its
great
fitness
and
beauty
the
marvellous
development
of
telegraphy
within
the
last
generation
has
called
into
existence
a
great
variety
of
receiving
instruments
each
admirable
in
its
way
the
hughes
or
the
stock
exchange
instruments
for
instance
print
the
message
in
roman
characters
the
sounders
strike
it
out
on
stops
or
bells
of
different
tone
the
needle
instruments
indicate
it
by
oscillations
of
their
needles
the
morse
daubs
it
in
ink
on
paper
or
embosses
it
by
a
hard
style
while
bain
receiver
stains
it
on
chemically
prepared
paper
the
and
the
quadruple
receive
four
messages
at
once
and
record
them
separately
while
the
harmonic
telegraph
of
elisha
gray
can
receive
as
many
as
eight
simultaneously
by
means
of
notes
excited
by
the
current
in
eight
separate
tuning
forks
but
all
these
instruments
have
one
great
drawback
for
delicate
work
and
however
suitable
they
may
be
for
land
lines
they
are
next
to
useless
for
long
cables
they
require
a
certain
definite
strength
of
current
to
work
them
whatever
it
may
be
and
in
general
it
is
very
considerable
most
of
the
moving
parts
of
the
mechanism
are
comparatively
heavy
and
unless
the
current
is
of
the
proper
strength
to
move
them
the
instrument
is
dumb
while
in
bain
the
solution
requires
a
certain
power
of
current
to
decompose
it
and
leave
the
stain
in
overland
lines
the
current
traverses
the
wire
suddenly
like
a
bullet
and
at
its
full
strength
so
that
if
the
current
be
sufficiently
strong
these
instruments
will
be
worked
at
once
and
no
time
will
be
lost
but
it
is
quite
different
on
submarine
cables
there
the
current
is
slow
and
varying
it
travels
along
the
copper
wire
in
the
form
of
a
wave
or
undulation
and
is
received
feebly
at
first
then
gradually
rising
to
its
maximum
strength
and
finally
dying
away
again
as
slowly
as
it
rose
in
the
french
atlantic
cable
no
current
can
be
detected
by
the
most
delicate
galvanoscope
at
america
for
the
first
tenth
of
a
second
after
it
has
been
put
on
at
brest
and
it
takes
about
half
a
second
for
the
received
current
to
reach
its
maximum
value
this
is
owing
to
the
phenomenon
of
induction
very
important
in
submarine
cables
but
almost
entirely
absent
in
land
lines
in
submarine
cables
as
is
well
known
the
copper
wire
which
conveys
the
current
is
insulated
from
the
by
an
envelope
usually
of
now
the
electricity
sent
into
this
wire
induces
electricity
of
an
opposite
kind
to
itself
in
the
outside
and
the
attraction
set
up
between
these
two
kinds
back
the
current
in
the
wire
and
retards
its
passage
to
the
receiving
station
it
follows
that
with
a
receiving
instrument
set
to
indicate
a
particular
strength
of
current
the
rate
of
signalling
would
be
very
slow
on
long
cables
compared
to
land
lines
and
that
a
different
form
of
instrument
is
required
for
cable
work
this
fact
stood
greatly
in
the
way
of
early
cable
enterprise
sir
william
then
professor
thomson
first
solved
the
difficulty
by
his
invention
of
the
galvanometer
and
rendered
at
the
same
time
the
first
atlantic
cable
company
a
commercial
success
the
merit
of
this
receiving
instrument
is
that
it
indicates
with
extreme
sensibility
all
the
variations
of
the
current
in
the
cable
so
that
instead
of
having
to
wait
until
each
signal
wave
sent
into
the
cable
has
travelled
to
the
receiving
end
before
sending
another
a
series
of
waves
may
be
sent
after
each
other
in
rapid
succession
these
waves
encroaching
upon
each
other
will
coalesce
at
their
bases
but
if
the
crests
remain
separate
the
delicate
decipherer
at
the
other
end
will
take
cognisance
of
them
and
make
them
known
to
the
eye
as
the
distinct
signals
of
the
message
the
mirror
galvanometer
is
at
once
beautifully
simple
and
exquisitely
scientific
it
consists
of
a
very
long
fine
coil
of
copper
wire
and
in
the
heart
of
the
coil
within
a
little
a
small
round
mirror
having
four
tiny
magnets
cemented
to
its
back
is
hung
by
a
single
fibre
of
floss
silk
no
thicker
than
a
spider
line
the
mirror
is
of
film
glass
silvered
the
magnets
of
and
both
together
sometimes
weigh
only
of
a
grain
a
beam
of
light
is
thrown
from
a
lamp
upon
the
mirror
and
reflected
by
it
upon
a
white
screen
or
scale
a
few
feet
distant
where
it
forms
a
bright
spot
of
light
when
there
is
no
current
on
the
instrument
the
spot
of
light
remains
stationary
at
the
zero
position
on
the
screen
but
the
instant
a
current
traverses
the
long
wire
of
the
coil
the
suspended
magnets
twist
themselves
horizontally
out
of
their
former
position
the
mirror
is
of
course
inclined
with
them
and
the
beam
of
light
is
deflected
along
the
screen
to
one
side
or
the
other
according
to
the
nature
of
the
current
if
a
positive
current
that
is
to
say
a
current
from
the
copper
pole
of
the
battery
gives
a
deflection
to
the
right
of
zero
a
negative
current
or
a
current
from
the
zinc
pole
of
the
battery
will
give
a
deflection
to
the
left
of
zero
and
vice
versa
the
air
in
the
little
chamber
surrounding
the
mirror
is
compressed
at
will
so
as
to
act
like
a
cushion
and
the
movements
of
the
mirror
the
needle
is
thus
prevented
from
idly
swinging
about
at
each
deflection
and
the
separate
signals
are
rendered
abrupt
and
beat
as
it
is
called
at
a
receiving
station
the
current
coming
in
from
the
cable
has
simply
to
be
passed
through
the
coil
of
the
before
it
is
sent
into
the
ground
and
the
wandering
light
spot
on
the
screen
faithfully
represents
all
its
variations
to
the
clerk
who
looking
on
interprets
these
and
cries
out
the
message
word
by
word
the
small
weight
of
the
mirror
and
magnets
which
form
the
moving
part
of
this
instrument
and
the
range
to
which
the
minute
motions
of
the
mirror
can
be
magnified
on
the
screen
by
the
reflected
beam
of
light
which
acts
as
a
long
impalpable
hand
or
pointer
render
the
mirror
galvanometer
marvellously
sensitive
to
the
current
especially
when
compared
with
other
forms
of
receiving
instruments
messages
have
been
sent
from
england
to
america
through
one
atlantic
cable
and
back
again
to
england
through
another
and
there
received
on
the
mirror
galvanometer
the
electric
current
used
being
that
from
a
toy
battery
made
out
of
a
lady
silver
thimble
a
grain
of
zinc
and
a
drop
of
acidulated
water
the
practical
advantage
of
this
extreme
delicacy
is
that
the
signal
waves
of
the
current
may
follow
each
other
so
closely
as
almost
entirely
to
coalesce
leaving
only
a
very
slight
rise
and
fall
of
their
crests
like
ripples
on
the
surface
of
a
flowing
stream
and
yet
the
light
spot
will
respond
to
each
the
main
flow
of
the
current
will
of
course
shift
the
zero
of
the
spot
but
over
and
above
this
change
of
place
the
spot
will
follow
the
momentary
fluctuations
of
the
current
which
form
the
individual
signals
of
the
message
what
with
this
shifting
of
the
zero
and
the
very
slight
rise
and
fall
in
the
current
produced
by
rapid
signalling
the
ordinary
land
line
instruments
are
quite
unserviceable
for
work
upon
long
cables
the
mirror
instrument
has
this
drawback
however
it
does
not
the
message
there
is
a
great
practical
advantage
in
a
receiving
instrument
which
records
its
messages
errors
are
avoided
and
time
saved
it
was
to
supply
such
a
desideratum
for
cable
work
that
sir
william
thomson
invented
the
siphon
recorder
his
second
important
contribution
to
the
province
of
practical
telegraphy
he
aimed
at
giving
a
graphic
representation
of
the
varying
strength
of
the
current
just
as
the
mirror
galvanometer
gives
a
visual
one
the
difficulty
of
producing
such
a
recorder
was
as
he
himself
says
due
to
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
marks
from
a
very
light
body
in
rapid
motion
without
impeding
that
motion
the
moving
body
must
be
quite
free
to
follow
the
undulations
of
the
current
and
at
the
same
time
must
record
its
motions
by
some
indelible
mark
as
early
as
sir
william
sent
out
to
the
red
sea
cable
a
piece
of
apparatus
with
this
intent
the
marker
consisted
of
a
light
platinum
wire
constantly
emitting
sparks
from
a
rhumkorff
coil
so
as
to
perforate
a
line
on
a
strip
of
moving
paper
and
it
was
so
connected
to
the
movable
needle
of
a
species
of
galvanometer
as
to
imitate
the
motions
of
the
needle
but
before
it
reached
the
red
sea
the
cable
had
broken
down
and
the
instrument
was
returned
dismantled
to
be
superseded
at
length
by
the
siphon
recorder
in
which
the
marking
point
is
a
fine
glass
siphon
emitting
ink
and
the
moving
body
a
light
coil
of
wire
hung
between
the
poles
of
a
magnet
the
principle
of
the
siphon
recorder
is
exactly
the
inverse
of
the
mirror
galvanometer
in
the
latter
we
have
a
small
magnet
suspended
in
the
centre
of
a
large
coil
of
wire
the
wire
enclosing
the
magnet
which
is
free
to
rotate
round
its
own
axis
in
the
former
we
have
a
small
coil
suspended
between
the
poles
of
a
large
magnet
the
magnet
enclosing
the
coil
which
is
also
free
to
rotate
round
its
own
axis
when
a
current
passes
through
this
coil
so
suspended
in
the
highly
magnetic
space
between
the
poles
of
the
magnet
the
coil
itself
experiences
a
mechanical
force
causing
it
to
take
up
a
particular
position
which
varies
with
the
nature
of
the
current
and
the
siphon
which
is
attached
to
it
faithfully
figures
its
motion
on
the
running
paper
the
point
of
the
siphon
does
not
touch
the
paper
although
it
is
very
close
it
would
impede
the
motion
of
the
coil
if
it
did
but
the
attraction
of
so
fine
a
tube
will
not
permit
the
ink
to
flow
freely
of
itself
so
the
inventor
true
to
his
instincts
again
called
in
the
aid
of
electricity
and
electrified
the
ink
the
siphon
and
reservoir
are
together
supported
by
an
ebonite
bracket
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
instrument
and
insulated
from
it
that
is
to
say
electricity
can
not
escape
from
them
to
the
instrument
the
ink
may
therefore
be
electrified
to
an
exalted
state
or
high
potential
as
it
is
called
while
the
body
of
the
instrument
including
the
paper
and
metal
are
in
connection
with
the
earth
and
at
low
potential
or
none
at
all
for
the
potential
of
the
earth
is
in
general
taken
as
zero
the
ink
for
example
is
like
a
supported
over
the
earth
surface
now
the
tendency
of
a
charged
body
is
to
move
from
a
place
of
higher
to
a
place
of
lower
potential
and
consequently
the
ink
tends
to
flow
downwards
to
the
the
only
avenue
of
escape
for
it
is
by
the
fine
glass
siphon
and
through
this
it
rushes
accordingly
and
discharges
itself
in
a
rain
upon
the
paper
the
natural
repulsion
between
its
like
electrified
particles
causes
the
shower
to
issue
in
spray
as
the
paper
moves
over
the
pulleys
a
delicate
hair
line
is
marked
straight
when
the
siphon
is
stationary
but
curved
when
the
siphon
is
pulled
from
side
to
side
by
the
oscillations
of
the
signal
coil
it
is
to
the
that
me
must
look
both
for
the
electricity
which
is
used
to
electrify
the
ink
and
for
the
motive
power
which
drives
the
paper
this
unique
and
interesting
little
motor
owes
its
somewhat
epigrammatic
title
to
the
resemblance
of
the
drum
to
one
of
those
sparred
wheels
turned
by
white
mice
and
to
the
amusing
fact
of
its
capacity
for
performing
work
having
been
originally
computed
in
terms
of
a
the
mill
is
turned
by
a
stream
of
electricity
flowing
from
the
battery
above
described
and
is
in
fact
an
engine
worked
by
the
current
the
alphabet
of
signals
employed
is
the
code
so
generally
in
vogue
throughout
the
world
in
the
morse
code
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
represented
by
combinations
of
two
distinct
elementary
signals
technically
called
and
from
the
fact
that
the
morse
recorder
actually
marks
the
message
in
long
and
short
lines
or
dots
and
dashes
in
the
siphon
recorder
script
dots
and
dashes
are
represented
by
curves
of
opposite
flexure
the
condensers
are
merely
used
to
sharpen
the
action
of
the
current
and
render
the
signals
more
concise
and
distinct
on
long
cables
on
short
cables
say
under
three
hundred
miles
long
they
are
rarely
if
ever
used
the
speed
of
signalling
by
the
siphon
recorder
is
of
course
regulated
by
the
length
of
cable
through
which
it
is
worked
the
instrument
itself
is
capable
of
a
wide
range
of
speed
the
best
operators
can
not
send
over
words
per
minute
by
hand
but
a
hundred
and
twenty
words
or
more
per
minute
can
be
transmitted
by
an
automatic
sender
and
the
recorder
has
been
found
on
land
lines
and
short
cables
to
write
off
the
message
at
this
incredible
speed
when
we
consider
that
every
word
is
on
the
average
composed
of
fifteen
separate
waves
we
may
better
appreciate
the
rapidity
with
which
the
siphon
can
move
on
an
ordinary
cable
of
about
a
thousand
miles
long
the
working
speed
is
about
twenty
words
per
minute
on
the
french
atlantic
it
is
usually
about
thirteen
although
as
many
as
seventeen
have
sometimes
been
sent
the
system
or
method
of
telegraphing
in
opposite
directions
at
once
through
the
same
wire
has
of
late
years
been
applied
in
connection
with
the
recorder
to
all
the
long
cables
of
that
most
enterprising
of
telegraph
companies
the
eastern
so
that
both
stations
may
to
each
other
simultaneously
thus
the
carrying
capacity
of
the
wire
is
in
practice
nearly
doubled
and
recorders
are
busy
writing
at
both
ends
of
the
cable
at
once
as
if
the
messages
came
up
out
of
the
sea
itself
we
have
thus
far
followed
out
the
recorder
in
its
practical
application
to
submarine
telegraphy
let
us
now
regard
it
for
a
moment
in
its
more
philosophic
aspect
we
are
at
once
struck
with
its
as
a
machine
and
even
its
resemblance
in
some
respects
to
a
living
creature
all
its
activity
depends
on
the
galvanic
current
from
three
separate
sources
invisible
currents
are
led
to
its
principal
parts
and
are
at
once
physically
changed
that
entering
the
becomes
transmuted
in
part
into
the
mechanical
motion
of
the
revolving
drum
and
part
into
electricity
of
a
more
intense
nature
into
mimic
lightning
in
fact
with
its
accompaniments
of
heat
and
sound
that
entering
the
signal
magnet
expends
part
of
its
force
in
the
magnetism
of
the
core
that
entering
the
signal
coil
which
may
be
taken
as
the
brain
of
the
instrument
appears
to
us
as
intelligence
the
recorder
is
now
in
use
in
all
four
quarters
of
the
globe
from
northern
europe
to
southern
brazil
from
china
to
new
england
many
and
complete
are
the
adjustments
for
rendering
it
serviceable
under
a
wide
range
of
electrical
conditions
and
climatic
changes
the
siphon
is
of
course
in
a
mechanical
sense
the
most
delicate
part
but
in
an
electrical
sense
the
proves
the
most
susceptible
it
is
essential
for
the
fine
marking
of
the
siphon
that
the
ink
should
neither
be
too
strongly
nor
too
feebly
electrified
when
the
atmosphere
is
moderately
humid
a
proper
supply
of
electricity
is
generated
by
the
the
paper
is
sufficiently
moist
and
the
ink
flows
freely
but
an
excess
of
moisture
in
the
air
diminishes
the
available
supply
of
exalted
electricity
in
fact
the
damp
depositing
on
the
parts
leads
the
electricity
away
and
the
ink
tends
to
clog
in
the
siphon
on
the
other
hand
drought
not
only
supercharges
the
ink
but
dries
the
paper
so
much
that
it
insulates
the
siphon
point
from
the
metal
tablet
and
the
earth
there
is
then
an
insufficient
escape
for
the
electricity
of
the
ink
to
earth
the
ink
ceases
to
flow
down
the
siphon
the
siphon
itself
becomes
highly
electrified
and
agitated
with
vibrations
of
its
own
the
line
becomes
spluttered
and
uncertain
various
devices
are
employed
at
different
stations
to
cure
these
local
complaints
the
electrician
soon
learns
to
diagnose
and
prescribe
for
this
his
most
valuable
charge
at
aden
where
they
suffer
much
from
humidity
the
is
or
has
been
surrounded
with
burning
carbon
at
malta
a
gas
flame
was
used
for
the
same
purpose
at
suez
where
they
suffer
from
drought
a
cloud
of
steam
was
kept
rising
round
the
instrument
saturating
the
air
and
paper
at
more
temperate
places
the
ordinary
means
of
drying
the
air
by
taking
advantage
of
the
absorbing
power
of
sulphuric
acid
for
moisture
prevailed
at
marseilles
the
recorder
acted
in
some
respects
like
a
barometer
marseilles
is
subject
to
sudden
incursions
of
dry
northerly
winds
termed
the
mistral
the
recorder
never
failed
to
indicate
the
mistral
when
it
blew
and
sometimes
even
to
predict
it
by
many
hours
before
the
storm
was
itself
felt
the
delicate
glass
pen
became
agitated
and
disturbed
the
frail
blue
line
broken
and
irregular
the
electrician
knew
that
the
mistral
would
blow
before
long
and
as
it
rarely
blows
for
less
than
three
days
at
a
time
that
rather
rude
wind
so
dreaded
by
the
marseillaise
was
doubly
dreaded
by
him
the
recorder
was
first
used
experimentally
at

and
lady

sent
off
a

to

about
eleven
and
had
received
a
reply
before
twelve
telling
her
that
her
husband
and
sons
were
quite
well
at
five
the
next
morning
the
recorder
which
was
shown
in
operation
naturally
stood
in
the
place
of
honour
and
attracted
great
attention
the
minor
features
of
the
recorder
have
been
simplified
by
other
inventors
of
late
for
example
magnets
of
steel
have
been
substituted
for
the
which

on
the

by
a
rapid
vibration
of
the
siphon
point
to
introduce
his
apparatus
for
signalling
on
long
submarine
cables
sir
william
thomson
entered
into
a
partnership
with
varley
who
first
applied
condensers
to
sharpen
the
signals
and
professor
fleeming
jenkin
of
edinburgh
university
in
conjunction
with
the
latter
he
also
devised
an
curb
sender
or
key
for
sending
messages
on
a
cable
as
the
wheatstone
transmitter
sends
them
on
a
land
line
in
both
instruments
the
signals
are
sent
by
means
of
a
perforated
ribbon
of
paper
but
the
cable
sender
was
the
more
complicated
because
the
cable
signals
are
formed
by
both
positive
and
negative
currents
and
not
merely
by
a
single
current
whether
positive
or
negative
moreover
to
curb
the
prolongation
of
the
signals
due
to
induction
each
signal
was
made
by
two
opposite
currents
in
succession
a
positive
followed
by
a
negative
or
a
negative
followed
by
a
positive
as
the
case
might
be
the
had
the
effect
of
curbing
its
precursor
this
cable
key
was
brought
out
in
and
tried
on
the
lines
of
the
eastern
telegraph
company
sir
william
thomson
took
part
in
the
laying
of
the
french
atlantic
cable
of
and
with
professor
jenkin
was
engineer
of
the
western
and
brazilian
and
cables
he
was
present
at
the
laying
of
the
para
to
pernambuco
section
of
the
brazilian
coast
cables
in
and
introduced
his
method
of
sounding
in
which
a
steel
pianoforte
wire
replaces
the
ordinary
land
line
the
wire
glides
so
easily
to
the
bottom
that
soundings
can
be
taken
while
the
ship
is
going
at
full
speed
a
to
register
the
depth
of
the
sinker
has
been
added
by
sir
william
about
the
same
time
he
revived
the
sumner
method
of
finding
a
place
at
sea
and
calculated
a
set
of
tables
for
its
ready
application
his
most
important
aid
to
the
mariner
is
however
the
adjustable
compass
which
he
brought
out
soon
afterwards
it
is
a
great
improvement
on
the
older
instrument
being
steadier
less
hampered
by
friction
and
the
deviation
due
to
the
ship
own
magnetism
can
be
corrected
by
movable
masses
of
iron
at
the
binnacle
sir
william
is
himself
a
skilful
navigator
and
delights
to
cruise
in
his
fine
yacht
the
lalla
rookh
among
the
western
islands
or
up
the
mediterranean
or
across
the
atlantic
to
madeira
and
america
his
interest
in
all
things
relating
to
the
sea
perhaps
arose
or
at
any
rate
was
fostered
by
his
experiences
on
the
agamemnon
and
the
great
eastern
babbage
was
among
the
first
to
suggest
that
a
lighthouse
might
be
made
to
signal
a
distinctive
number
by
occultations
of
its
light
but
sir
william
pointed
out
the
merits
of
the
morse
telegraphic
code
for
the
purpose
and
urged
that
the
signals
should
consist
of
short
and
long
flashes
of
the
light
to
represent
the
dots
and
dashes
sir
william
has
done
more
than
any
other
electrician
to
introduce
accurate
methods
and
apparatus
for
measuring
electricity
as
early
as
his
mind
was
attracted
to
this
subject
he
pointed
out
that
the
experimental
results
of
william
snow
harris
were
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
coulomb
in
the
memoirs
of
the
roman
academy
of
sciences
for
he
published
a
description
of
his
new
divided
ring
electrometer
which
is
based
on
the
old
electroscope
of
bohnenberger
and
since
then
he
has
introduced
a
chain
or
series
of
beautiful
and
effective
instruments
including
the
quadrant
electrometer
which
cover
the
entire
field
of
electrostatic
measurement
his
delicate
mirror
galvanometer
has
also
been
the
forerunner
of
a
later
circle
of
equally
precise
apparatus
for
the
measurement
of
current
or
dynamic
electricity
to
give
even
a
brief
account
of
all
his
physical
researches
would
require
a
separate
volume
and
many
of
them
are
too
abstruse
or
mathematical
for
the
general
reader
his
varied
services
have
been
acknowledged
by
numerous
distinctions
including
the
highest
honour
a
british
man
of
science
can
obtain
the
presidency
of
the
royal
society
of
london
to
which
he
was
elected
at
the
end
of
last
year
sir
william
thomson
has
been
all
his
life
a
firm
believer
in
the
truth
of
christianity
and
his
great
scientific
attainments
add
weight
to
the
following
words
spoken
by
him
when
in
the
chair
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
christian
evidence
society
may
have
long
felt
that
there
was
a
general
impression
in
the
world
that
the
scientific
world
believes
science
has
discovered
ways
of
explaining
all
the
facts
of
nature
without
adopting
any
definite
belief
in
a
creator
i
have
never
doubted
that
that
impression
was
utterly
groundless
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
scientific
man
says
as
it
has
been
said
from
time
to
time
that
there
is
no
god
he
does
not
express
his
own
ideas
clearly
he
is
perhaps
struggling
with
difficulties
but
when
he
says
he
does
not
believe
in
a
creative
power
i
am
convinced
he
does
not
faithfully
express
what
is
in
his
own
mind
he
does
not
fully
express
his
own
ideas
he
is
out
of
his
depth
are
all
out
of
our
depth
when
we
approach
the
subject
of
life
the
scientific
man
in
looking
at
a
piece
of
dead
matter
thinking
over
the
results
of
certain
combinations
which
he
can
impose
upon
it
is
himself
a
living
miracle
proving
that
there
is
something
beyond
that
mass
of
dead
matter
of
which
he
is
thinking
his
very
thought
is
in
itself
a
contradiction
to
the
idea
that
there
is
nothing
in
existence
but
dead
matter
science
can
do
little
positively
towards
the
objects
of
this
society
but
it
can
do
something
and
that
something
is
vital
and
fundamental
it
is
to
show
that
what
we
see
in
the
world
of
dead
matter
and
of
life
around
us
is
not
a
result
of
the
fortuitous
concourse
of
atoms
may
refer
to
that
old
but
never
uninteresting
subject
of
the
miracles
of
geology
physical
science
does
something
for
us
here
peter
speaks
of
scoffers
who
said
that
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
but
the
apostle
affirms
himself
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved
it
seems
to
me
that
even
physical
science
absolutely
demonstrates
the
scientific
truth
of
these
words
we
feel
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
things
going
on
for
ever
as
they
have
done
for
the
last
six
thousand
years
in
science
as
in
morals
and
politics
there
is
absolutely
no
periodicity
one
thing
we
may
prophesy
of
the
future
for
certain
it
will
be
unlike
the
past
everything
is
in
a
state
of
evolution
and
progress
the
science
of
dead
matter
which
has
been
the
principal
subject
of
my
thoughts
during
my
life
is
i
may
say
strenuous
on
this
point
that
the
age
of
the
earth
is
definite
we
do
not
say
whether
it
is
twenty
million
years
or
more
or
less
but
me
say
it
is
not
indefinite
and
we
can
say
very
definitely
that
it
is
not
an
inconceivably
great
number
of
millions
of
years
here
then
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
the
most
wonderful
of
all
miracles
the
commencement
of
life
on
this
earth
this
earth
certainly
a
moderate
number
of
millions
of
years
ago
was
a
globe
all
scientific
men
of
the
present
day
agree
that
life
came
upon
this
earth
somehow
if
some
form
or
some
part
of
the
life
at
present
existing
came
to
this
earth
carried
on
some
stone
perhaps
broken
away
from
mountains
in
other
worlds
even
if
some
part
of
the
life
had
come
in
that
way
for
there
is
nothing
too
in
the
idea
and
probably
some
such
action
as
that
did
take
place
since
meteors
do
come
every
day
to
the
earth
from
other
parts
of
the
universe
still
that
does
not
in
the
slightest
degree
diminish
the
wonder
the
tremendous
miracle
we
have
in
the
commencement
of
life
in
this
world

charles
william
siemens
charles
william
siemens
was
born
on
april
at
the
little
village
of
lenthe
about
eight
miles
from
hanover
where
his
father
christian
ferdinand
siemens
was
and
farmed
an
estate
belonging
to
the
crown
his
mother
was
eleonore
deichmann
a
lady
of
noble
disposition
and
william
or
carl
wilhelm
was
the
fourth
son
of
a
family
of
fourteen
children
several
of
whom
have
distinguished
themselves
in
scientific
pursuits
of
these
ernst
werner
siemens
the
fourth
child
and
now
the
famous
electrician
of
berlin
was
associated
with
william
in
many
of
his
inventions
fritz
the
ninth
child
is
the
head
of
the
dresden
glass
works
and
carl
the
tenth
child
is
chief
of
the
equally
electrical
works
at
petersburg
several
of
the
family
died
young
others
remained
in
germany
but
the
enterprising
spirit
natural
to
them
led
most
of
the
sons
abroad
walter
the
twelfth
child
dying
at
tiflis
as
the
german
consul
there
and
otto
the
fourteenth
child
also
dying
at
the
same
place
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
more
remarkable
family
in
any
age
or
country
soon
after
the
birth
of
william
siemens
removed
to
a
larger
estate
which
he
had
leased
at
menzendorf
near
lubeck
as
a
child
william
was
sensitive
and
affectionate
the
baby
of
the
family
liking
to
roam
the
woods
and
fields
by
himself
and
curious
to
observe
but
not
otherwise
giving
any
signs
of
the
engineer
he
received
his
education
at
a
commercial
academy
in
lubeck
the
industrial
school
at
magdeburg
city
of
the
memorable
burgomaster
otto
von
guericke
and
at
the
university
of
gottingen
which
he
entered
in
while
in
his
eighteenth
year
were
he
attended
the
chemical
lectures
of
woehler
the
discoverer
of
organic
synthesis
and
of
professor
himly
the
physicist
who
was
married
to
siemens
eldest
sister
mathilde
with
a
year
at
gottingen
during
which
he
laid
the
basis
of
his
theoretical
knowledge
the
academical
training
of
siemens
came
to
an
end
and
he
entered
practical
life
in
the
engineering
works
of
count
stolberg
at
magdeburg
at
the
university
he
had
been
instructed
in
mechanical
laws
and
designs
here
he
learned
the
nature
and
use
of
tools
and
the
construction
of
machines
but
as
his
university
career
at
gottingen
lasted
only
about
a
year
so
did
his
apprenticeship
at
the
stolberg
works
in
this
short
time
however
he
probably
reaped
as
much
advantage
as
a
duller
pupil
during
a
far
longer
term
young
siemens
appears
to
have
been
determined
to
push
his
way
forward
in
his
brother
werner
obtained
a
patent
in
prussia
for
and
gilding
and
in
charles
william
came
to
england
to
try
and
introduce
the
process
here
in
his
address
on
and
industry
delivered
before
the
birmingham
and
midland
institute
in
while
the
paris
electrical
exhibition
was
running
sir
william
gave
a
most
interesting
account
of
his
experiences
during
that
first
visit
to
the
country
of
his
adoption
said
he
electrotype
process
first
became
known
it
excited
a
very
general
interest
and
although
i
was
only
a
young
student
at
gottingen
under
twenty
years
of
age
who
had
just
entered
upon
his
practical
career
with
a
mechanical
engineer
i
joined
my
brother
werner
siemens
then
a
young
lieutenant
of
artillery
in
the
prussian
service
in
his
endeavours
to
accomplish
the
first
impulse
in
this
direction
having
been
given
by
professor
himly
then
of
gottingen
after
attaining
some
promising
results
a
spirit
of
enterprise
came
over
me
so
strong
that
i
tore
myself
away
from
the
narrow
circumstances
surrounding
me
and
landed
at
the
east
end
of
london
with
only
a
few
pounds
in
my
pocket
and
without
friends
but
with
an
ardent
confidence
of
ultimate
success
within
my
breast
expected
to
find
some
office
in
which
inventions
were
examined
into
and
rewarded
if
found
meritorious
but
no
one
could
direct
me
to
such
a
place
in
walking
along
finsbury
pavement
i
saw
written
up
in
large
letters
i
forget
the
name
undertaker
and
the
thought
struck
me
that
this
must
be
the
place
i
was
in
quest
of
at
any
rate
i
thought
that
a
person
advertising
himself
as
an
undertaker
would
not
refuse
to
look
into
my
invention
with
a
view
of
obtaining
for
me
the
recognition
or
reward
on
entering
the
place
i
soon
convinced
myself
however
that
i
came
decidedly
too
soon
for
the
kind
of
enterprise
here
contemplated
and
finding
myself
confronted
with
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
i
covered
my
retreat
by
what
he
must
have
thought
a
very
lame
excuse
by
dint
of
perseverance
i
found
my
way
to
the
patent
office
of
poole
and
carpmael
who
received
me
kindly
and
provided
me
with
a
letter
of
introduction
to
elkington
armed
with
this
letter
i
proceeded
to
birmingham
to
plead
my
cause
before
your
townsman
looking
back
to
that
time
i
wonder
at
the
patience
with
which
elkington
listened
to
what
i
had
to
say
being
very
young
and
scarcely
able
to
find
english
words
to
convey
my
meaning
after
showing
me
what
he
was
doing
already
in
the
way
of
elkington
sent
me
back
to
london
in
order
to
read
some
patents
of
his
own
asking
me
to
return
if
after
perusal
i
still
thought
i
could
teach
him
anything
to
my
great
disappointment
i
found
that
the
chemical
solutions
i
had
been
using
were
actually
mentioned
in
one
of
his
patents
although
in
a
manner
that
would
hardly
have
sufficed
to
enable
a
third
person
to
obtain
practical
results
on
my
return
to
birmingham
i
frankly
stated
what
i
had
found
and
with
this
frankness
i
evidently
gained
the
favour
of
another
townsman
of
yours
josiah
mason
who
had
just
joined
elkington
in
business
and
whose
name
as
sir
josiah
mason
will
ever
be
remembered
for
his
munificent
endowment
of
education
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
not
be
judged
by
the
novelty
of
my
invention
but
by
the
results
which
i
promised
namely
of
being
able
to
deposit
with
a
smooth
surface
dwt
of
silver
upon
a
the
crystalline
structure
of
the
deposit
having
theretofore
been
a
source
of
difficulty
in
this
i
succeeded
and
i
was
able
to
return
to
my
native
country
and
my
mechanical
engineering
a
comparative
croesus
it
was
not
for
long
as
in
the
following
year
i
again
landed
in
the
thames
with
another
invention
worked
out
also
with
my
brother
namely
the
chronometric
governor
which
though
less
successful
commercially
speaking
than
the
first
obtained
for
me
the
advantage
of
bringing
me
into
contact
with
the
engineering
world
and
of
fixing
me
permanently
in
this
country
this
invention
was
in
course
of
time
applied
by
sir
george
airy
the
then
for
regulating
the
motion
of
his
great
transit
and
instrument
at
the
royal
observatory
where
it
still
continues
to
be
employed
early
subject
of
mine
the
anastatic
printing
process
found
favour
with
faraday
the
great
and
the
good
who
made
it
the
subject
of
a
friday
evening
lecture
at
the
royal
institution
these
two
circumstances
combined
obtained
for
me
an
entry
into
scientific
circles
and
helped
to
sustain
me
in
difficulty
until
by
dint
of
a
certain
determination
to
win
i
was
able
to
advance
step
by
step
up
to
this
place
of
honour
situated
within
a
gunshot
of
the
scene
of
my
earliest
success
in
life
but
separated
from
it
by
the
time
of
a
generation
but
notwithstanding
the
lapse
of
time
my
heart
still
beats
quick
each
time
i
come
back
to
the
scene
of
this
the
determining
incident
of
my
life
the
process
described
by
faraday
in
and
partly
due
to
werner
siemens
was
a
method
of
reproducing
printed
matter
by
transferring
the
print
from
paper
to
plates
of
zinc
caustic
baryta
was
applied
to
the
printed
sheet
to
convert
the
resinous
ingredients
of
the
ink
into
an
insoluble
soap
the
stearine
being
precipitated
with
sulphuric
acid
the
letters
were
then
transferred
to
the
zinc
by
pressure
so
as
to
be
printed
from
the
process
though
ingenious
and
of
much
interest
at
the
time
has
long
ago
been
superseded
by
photographic
methods
even
at
this
time
siemens
had
several
irons
in
the
fire
besides
the
printing
process
and
the
chronometric
governor
which
operated
by
the
differential
movement
between
the
engine
and
a
chronometer
he
was
occupied
with
some
minor
improvements
at
hoyle
calico
printing
works
he
also
engaged
in
railway
works
from
time
to
time
and
in
he
brought
out
a
double
cylinder
in
which
the
two
cylinders
are
so
combined
that
the
compressing
side
of
the
first
and
larger
cylinder
communicated
with
the
suction
side
of
the
second
and
smaller
cylinder
and
the
limit
of
exhaustion
was
thereby
much
extended
the
invention
was
well
received
at
the
time
but
is
now
almost
forgotten
siemens
had
been
trained
as
a
mechanical
engineer
and
although
he
became
an
eminent
electrician
in
later
life
his
most
important
work
at
this
early
stage
was
indeed
the
greatest
achievement
of
his
life
was
for
we
must
regard
the
regenerative
furnace
as
his
magnum
opus
though
in
he
published
a
paper
in
annalen
der
chemie
on
the
of
selenium
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
new
ideas
upon
the
nature
of
heat
which
were
promulgated
by
carnot
clayperon
joule
clausius
mayer
thomson
and
rankine
he
discarded
the
older
notions
of
heat
as
a
substance
and
accepted
it
as
a
form
of
energy
working
on
this
new
line
of
thought
which
gave
him
an
advantage
over
other
inventors
of
his
time
he
made
his
first
attempt
to
economise
heat
by
constructing
in
at
the
factory
of
john
hick
of
bolton
an
engine
of
four
having
a
condenser
provided
with
regenerators
and
utilising
superheated
steam
two
years
later
he
continued
his
experiments
at
the
works
of
fox
henderson
and
of
smethwick
near
birmingham
who
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
the
use
of
superheated
steam
was
however
attended
with
many
practical
difficulties
and
the
invention
was
not
entirely
successful
but
it
embraced
the
elements
of
success
and
the
society
of
arts
in
acknowledged
the
value
of
the
principle
by
awarding
siemens
a
gold
medal
for
his
regenerative
condenser
various
papers
read
before
the
institution
of
mechanical
engineers
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
or
appearing
in
dingler
journal
and
the
journal
of
the
franklin
institute
about
this
time
illustrate
the
workings
of
his
mind
upon
the
subject
that
read
in
before
the

the
conversion
of
heat
into
mechanical
effect
was
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
communications
to
that
learned
body
and
gained
for
its
author
the
telford
premium
and
medal
in
it
he
contended
that
a
perfect
engine
would
be
one
in
which
all
the
heat
applied
to
the
steam
was
used
up
in
its
expansion
behind
a
working
piston
leaving
none
to
be
sent
into
a
condenser
or
the
atmosphere
and
that
the
best
results
in
any
actual
engine
would
be
attained
by
carrying
expansion
to
the
furthest
possible
limit
or
in
practice
by
the
application
of
a
regenerator
anxious
to
realise
his
theories
further
he
constructed
a
twenty
engine
on
the
regenerative
plan
and
exhibited
it
at
the
paris
universal
exhibition
of
but
not
realising
his
expectations
he
substituted
for
it
another
of
power
made
by
farcot
of
paris
which
was
found
to
work
with
considerable
economy
the
use
of
superheated
steam
however
still
proved
a
drawback
and
the
siemens
engine
has
not
been
extensively
used
on
the
other
hand
the
siemens
which
he
introduced
in
has
been
very
widely
used
not
only
in
this
country
but
abroad
it
acts
equally
well
under
all
variations
of
pressure
and
with
a
constant
or
an
intermittent
supply
meanwhile
his
brother
werner
had
been
turning
his
attention
to
telegraphy
and
the
correspondence
which
never
ceased
between
the
brothers
kept
william
acquainted
with
his
doings
in
werner
then
an
officer
in
the
prussian
army
was
appointed
to
a
berth
in
the
artillery
workshops
of
berlin
where
he
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
new
art
of
telegraphy
in
werner
patented
his
dial
and
printing
telegraph
instruments
which
came
into
use
all
over
germany
and
introduced
an
automatic
alarm
on
the
same
principle
these
inventions
led
to
his
being
made
in
a
member
of
a
commission
in
berlin
for
the
introduction
of
electric
telegraphs
instead
of
semaphores
he
advocated
the
use
of
then
a
new
material
for
the
insulation
of
underground
wires
and
in
designed
a
for
coating
the
wires
with
the
gum
rendered
plastic
by
heat
the
following
year
he
laid
the
first
great
underground
telegraph
line
from
berlin
to
and
soon
afterwards
left
the
army
to
engage
with
halske
in
the
management
of
a
telegraph
factory
which
they
had
conjointly
established
in
in
william
took
an
office
in
john
street
adelphi
with
a
view
to
practise
as
a
civil
engineer
eleven
years
later
halske
and
william
siemens
founded
in
london
the
house
of
siemens
halske
which
began
with
a
small
factory
at
millbank
and
developed
in
course
of
time
into
the
firm
of
siemens
brothers
and
was
recently
transformed
into
a
limited
liability
company
in
william
siemens
became
a
naturalised
englishman
and
from
this
time
forward
took
an
active
part
in
the
progress
of
english
engineering
and
telegraphy
he
devoted
a
great
part
of
his
time
to
electrical
invention
and
research
and
the
number
of
telegraph
apparatus
of
all
sorts
telegraph
cables
land
lines
and
their
accessories
which
have
emanated
from
the
siemens
telegraph
works
has
been
remarkable
the
engineers
of
this
firm
have
been
pioneers
of
the
electric
telegraph
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
both
by
land
and
sea
the
most
important
aerial
line
erected
by
the
firm
was
the
telegraph
line
through
prussia
russia
and
persia
to
india
the
north
china
cable
the
and
the
direct
united
states
cable
were
laid
by
the
firm
the
latter
in
so
also
was
the
french
atlantic
cable
and
the
two
jay
could
atlantic
cables
at
the
time
of
his
death
the
manufacture
and
laying
of
the
atlantic
cables
was
in
progress
at
the
company
works
charlton
some
idea
of
the
extent
of
this
manufactory
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
it
gives
employment
to
some
men
all
branches
of
electrical
work
are
followed
out
in
its
various
departments
including
the
construction
of
dynamos
and
electric
lamps
on
july
siemens
was
married
at
james
paddington
to
anne
the
youngest
daughter
of
joseph
gordon
writer
to
the
signet
edinburgh
and
brother
to
lewis
gordon
professor
of
engineering
in
the
university
of
glasgow
he
used
to
say
that
on
march
of
that
year
he
took
oath
and
allegiance
to
two
ladies
in
one
day
to
the
queen
and
his
betrothed
the
marriage
was
a
thoroughly
happy
one
although
much
engaged
in
the
advancement
of
telegraphy
he
was
also
occupied
with
his
favourite
idea
of
regeneration
the
regenerative
gas
furnace
originally
invented
in
by
his
brother
friedrich
was
perfected
and
introduced
by
him
during
many
succeeding
years
the
difficulties
overcome
in
the
development
of
this
invention
were
enormous
but
the
final
triumph
was
complete
the
principle
of
this
furnace
consists
in
utilising
the
heat
of
the
products
of
combustion
to
warm
up
the
gaseous
fuel
and
air
which
enters
the
furnace
this
is
done
by
making
these
products
pass
through
brickwork
chambers
which
absorb
their
heat
and
communicate
it
to
the
gas
and
air
currents
going
to
the
flame
an
extremely
high
temperature
is
thus
obtained
and
the
furnace
has
in
consequence
been
largely
used
in
the
manufacture
of
glass
and
steel
before
the
introduction
of
this
furnace
attempts
had
been
made
to
produce
without
the
use
of
a
crucible
that
is
to
say
on
the
hearth
of
the
furnace
reaumur
was
probably
the
first
to
show
that
steel
could
be
made
by
fusing
malleable
iron
with
heath
patented
the
process
in
and
a
quantity
of
was
actually
prepared
in
this
way
on
the
bed
of
a
reverberatory
furnace
by
sudre
in
france
during
the
year
but
the
furnace
was
destroyed
in
the
act
and
it
remained
for
siemens
with
his
regenerative
furnace
to
realise
the
object
in
charles
atwood
of
tow
law
agreed
to
erect
such
a
furnace
and
give
the
process
a
fair
trial
but
although
successful
in
producing
the
steel
he
was
afraid
its
temper
was
not
satisfactory
and
discontinued
the
experiment
next
year
however
siemens
who
was
not
to
be
disheartened
made
another
attempt
with
a
large
furnace
erected
at
the
montlucon
works
in
france
where
he
was
assisted
by
the
late
le
chatellier
des
mines
some
charges
of
steel
were
produced
but
here
again
the
roof
of
the
furnace
melted
down
and
the
company
which
had
undertaken
the
trials
gave
them
up
the
temperature
required
for
the
manufacture
of
the
steel
was
higher
than
the
melting
point
of
most
further
endeavours
also
led
to
disappointments
but
in
the
end
the
inventor
was
successful
he
erected
experimental
works
at
birmingham
and
gradually
matured
his
process
until
it
was
so
far
advanced
that
it
could
be
trusted
to
the
hands
of
others
siemens
used
a
mixture
of
and
iron
ore
to
make
the
steel
but
another
manufacturer
martin
of
sireuil
in
france
developed
the
older
plan
of
mixing
the
with
scrap
while
siemens
was
improving
his
means
at
birmingham
martin
was
obtaining
satisfactory
results
with
a
regenerative
furnace
of
his
own
design
and
at
the
paris
exhibition
of
samples
of
good
steel
were
shown
by
both
manufacturers
in
england
the
process
is
now
generally
known
as
the
and
on
the
continent
as
the
process
the
regenerative
furnace
is
the
greatest
single
invention
of
charles
william
siemens
owing
to
the
large
demand
for
steel
for
engineering
operations
both
at
home
and
abroad
it
proved
exceedingly
remunerative
extensive
works
for
the
application
of
the
process
were
erected
at
landore
where
siemens
prosecuted
his
experiments
on
the
subject
with
unfailing
ardour
and
among
other
things
succeeded
in
making
a
basic
brick
for
the
lining
of
his
furnaces
which
withstood
the
intense
heat
fairly
well
the
process
in
detail
consists
in
freeing
the
bath
of
melted
from
excess
of
carbon
by
adding
broken
lumps
of
pure
hematite
or
magnetite
iron
ore
this
causes
a
violent
boiling
which
is
kept
up
until
the
metal
becomes
soft
enough
when
it
is
allowed
to
stand
to
let
the
metal
clear
from
the
slag
which
floats
in
scum
upon
the
top
the
separation
of
the
slag
and
iron
is
facilitated
by
throwing
in
some
lime
from
time
to
time
spiegel
or
specular
iron
is
then
added
about
per
cent
more
than
in
the
scrap
process
from
to
cwt
of
ore
are
used
in
a
charge
and
about
half
the
metal
is
reduced
and
turned
into
steel
so
that
the
yield
in
ingots
is
from
to
per
cent
more
than
the
weight
of
pig
and
spiegel
iron
in
the
charge
the
consumption
of
coal
is
rather
larger
than
in
the
scrap
process
and
is
from
to
cwt
per
ton
of
steel
the
two
processes
of
siemens
and
martin
are
often
combined
both
scrap
and
ore
being
used
in
the
same
charge
the
latter
being
valuable
as
a
tempering
material
at
present
there
are
several
large
works
engaged
in
manufacturing
the
steel
in
england
namely
the
landore
the
parkhead
forge
those
of
the
steel
company
of
scotland
of
vickers
sheffield
and
others
these
produced
no
less
than
tons
of
steel
during
the
year
and
two
years
later
the
total
output
had
risen
to
half
a
million
tons
in
the
british
admiralty
built
two
the
mercury
and
iris
of
steel
and
the
experiment
proved
so
satisfactory
that
this
material
only
is
now
used
in
the
royal
dockyards
for
the
construction
of
hulls
and
boilers
moreover
the
use
of
it
is
gradually
extending
in
the
mercantile
marine
contemporaneous
with
his
development
of
the
process
william
siemens
introduced
the
rotary
furnace
for
producing
direct
from
the
ore
without
the
need
of
puddling
the
fervent
heat
of
the
siemens
furnace
led
the
inventor
to
devise
a
novel
means
of
measuring
high
temperatures
which
illustrates
the
value
of
a
broad
scientific
training
to
the
inventor
and
the
happy
manner
in
which
william
siemens
above
all
others
turned
his
varied
knowledge
to
account
and
brought
the
facts
and
resources
of
one
science
to
bear
upon
another
as
early
as
while
engaged
in
testing
the
conductor
of
the
malta
to
alexandria
telegraph
cable
then
in
course
of
manufacture
he
was
struck
by
the
increase
of
resistance
in
metallic
wires
occasioned
by
a
rise
of
temperature
and
the
following
year
he
devised
a
thermometer
based
on
the
fact
which
he
exhibited
before
the
british
association
at
manchester
mathiessen
and
others
have
since
enunciated
the
law
according
to
which
this
rise
of
resistance
varies
with
rise
of
temperature
and
siemens
has
further
perfected
his
apparatus
and
applied
it
as
a
pyrometer
to
the
measurement
of
furnace
fires
it
forms
in
reality
an
electric
thermometer
which
will
indicate
the
temperature
of
an
inaccessible
spot
a
coil
of
platinum
or
wire
is
enclosed
in
a
suitable
case
and
put
into
the
furnace
of
which
the
temperature
is
wanted
connecting
wires
properly
protected
lend
from
the
coil
to
a
differential
voltameter
so
that
by
means
of
the
current
from
a
battery
circulating
in
the
system
the
electric
resistance
of
the
coil
in
the
furnace
can
be
determined
at
any
moment
since
this
resistance
depends
on
the
temperature
of
the
furnace
the
temperature
call
be
found
from
the
resistance
observed
the
instrument
formed
the
subject
of
the
bakerian
lecture
for
the
year
siemens
researches
on
this
subject
as
published
in
the
journal
of
the
society
of
telegraph
engineers
vol
and
vol
included
a
set
of
curves
graphically
representing
the
relation
between
temperature
and
electrical
resistance
in
the
case
of
various
metals
the
electric
pyrometer
which
is
perhaps
the
most
elegant
and
original
of
all
william
siemens
inventions
is
also
the
link
which
connects
his
electrical
with
his
metallurgical
researches
his
invention
ran
in
two
great
grooves
one
based
upon
the
science
of
heat
the
other
based
upon
the
science
of
electricity
and
the
electric
thermometer
was
as
it
were
a
delicate
which
connected
both
siemens
might
have
been
two
men
if
we
are
to
judge
by
the
work
he
did
and
either
half
of
the
he
led
would
of
itself
suffice
to
make
an
eminent
reputation
the
success
of
his
metallurgical
enterprise
no
doubt
reacted
on
his
telegraphic
business
the
making
and
laying
of
the
malta
to
alexandria
cable
gave
rise
to
researches
on
the
resistance
and
electrification
of
insulating
materials
under
pressure
which
formed
the
subject
of
a
paper
read
before
the
british
association
in
the
effect
of
pressure
up
to
atmospheres
was
observed
and
the
fact
elicited
that
the
inductive
capacity
of
is
not
affected
by
increased
pressure
whereas
that
of
is
diminished
the
electrical
tests
employed
during
the
construction
of
the
malta
and
alexandria
cable
and
the
insulation
and
protection
of
submarine
cables
also
formed
the
subject
of
a
paper
which
was
read
before
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
in
it
is
always
interesting
to
trace
the
necessity
which
directly
or
indirectly
was
the
parent
of
a
particular
invention
and
in
the
great
importance
of
an
accurate
record
of
the
in
which
a
cable
is
being
laid
together
with
the
tedious
and
troublesome
character
of
ordinary
sounding
by
the
especially
when
a
ship
is
actually
paying
out
cable
we
may
find
the
requirements
which
led
to
the
invention
of
the
an
instrument
designed
to
indicate
the
depth
of
water
over
which
a
vessel
is
passing
without
submerging
a
line
the
instrument
was
based
on
the
ingenious
idea
that
the
attractive
power
of
the
earth
on
a
body
in
the
ship
must
depend
on
the
depth
of
water
interposed
between
it
and
the
sea
bottom
being
less
as
the
layer
of
water
was
thicker
owing
to
the
lighter
character
of
water
as
compared
with
the
denser
land
siemens
endeavoured
to
render
this
difference
visible
by
means
of
mercury
contained
in
a
chamber
having
a
bottom
extremely
sensitive
to
the
pressure
of
the
mercury
upon
it
and
resembling
in
some
respects
the
vacuous
chamber
of
an
aneroid
barometer
just
as
the
latter
instrument
indicates
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
above
it
so
the
bathometer
was
intended
to
show
the
pull
of
the
earth
below
it
and
experiment
proved
we
believe
that
for
every
fathoms
of
below
the
ship
the
total
gravity
of
the
mercury
was
reduced
by
part
the
bathometer
or
was
brought
out
in
and
exhibited
at
the
loan
exhibition
in
south
kensington
the
elastic
bottom
of
the
mercury
chamber
was
supported
by
volute
springs
which
always
having
the
same
tension
caused
a
portion
of
the
mercury
to
rise
or
fall
in
a
spiral
tube
of
glass
according
to
the
variations
of
the
earth
attraction
the
whole
was
kept
at
an
even
temperature
and
correction
was
made
for
barometric
influence
though
of
high
scientific
interest
the
apparatus
appears
to
have
failed
at
the
time
from
its
very
sensitiveness
the
waves
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
having
a
greater
disturbing
action
on
its
readings
than
the
change
of
depth
siemens
took
a
great
interest
in
this
very
original
machine
and
also
devised
a
form
applicable
to
the
measurement
of
heights
although
he
laid
the
subject
aside
for
some
years
he
ultimately
took
it
up
again
in
hopes
of
producing
a
practical
apparatus
which
would
be
of
immediate
service
in
the
cable
expeditions
of
the
faraday
this
admirable
cable
steamer
of
tons
register
was
built
for
siemens
brothers
by
mitchell
at
newcastle
the
designs
were
mainly
inspired
by
siemens
himself
and
after
the
hooper
now
the
silvertown
she
was
the
second
ship
expressly
built
for
cable
purposes
all
the
latest
improvements
that
electric
science
and
naval
engineering
could
suggest
were
in
her
united
with
a
length
of
feet
a
width
of
feet
and
a
depth
of
feet
in
the
hold
she
was
fitted
with
a
rudder
at
each
end
either
of
which
could
be
locked
when
desired
and
the
other
brought
into
play
two
screw
propellers
actuated
by
a
pair
of
compound
engines
were
the
means
of
driving
the
vessel
and
they
were
placed
at
a
slight
angle
to
each
other
so
that
when
the
engines
were
worked
in
opposite
directions
the
faraday
could
turn
completely
round
in
her
own
length
moreover
as
the
ship
could
steam
forwards
or
backwards
with
equal
ease
it
became
unnecessary
to
pass
the
cable
forward
before
hauling
it
in
if
a
fault
were
discovered
in
the
part
submerged
the
motion
of
the
ship
had
only
to
be
reversed
the
stern
rudder
fixed
and
the
bow
rudder
turned
while
a
small
engine
was
employed
to
haul
the
cable
back
over
the
stern
drum
which
had
been
used
a
few
minutes
before
to
pay
it
out
the
first
expedition
of
the
faraday
was
the
laying
of
the
direct
united
states
cable
in
the
winter
of
a
work
which
though
interrupted
by
stormy
weather
was
resumed
and
completed
in
the
summer
of
she
has
been
engaged
in
laying
several
atlantic
cables
since
and
has
been
fitted
with
the
electric
light
a
resource
which
has
proved
of
the
utmost
service
not
only
in
facilitating
the
night
operations
of
but
in
guarding
the
ship
from
collision
with
icebergs
in
foggy
weather
off
the
north
american
coast
mention
of
the
electric
light
brings
us
to
an
important
act
of
the
inventor
which
though
done
on
behalf
of
his
brother
werner
was
pregnant
with
great
consequences
this
was
his
announcement
before
a
meeting
of
the
royal
society
held
on
february
of
the
discovery
of
the
principle
of
reinforcing
the
field
magnetism
of
generators
by
part
or
the
whole
of
the
current
generated
in
the
revolving
armature
a
principle
which
has
been
applied
in
the
machines
now
so
much
used
for
producing
electric
light
and
effecting
the
transmission
of
power
to
a
distance
by
means
of
the
electric
current
by
a
curious
coincidence
the
same
principle
was
enunciated
by
sir
charles
wheatstone
at
the
very
same
meeting
while
a
few
months
previously
varley
had
lodged
an
application
for
a
british
patent
in
which
the
same
idea
was
set
forth
the
claims
of
these
three
inventors
to
priority
in
the
discovery
were
however
anticipated
by
at
least
one
other
investigator
herr
soren
hjorth
believed
to
be
a
dane
by
birth
and
still
remembered
by
a
few
living
electricians
though
forgotten
by
the
scientific
world
at
large
until
his
neglected
specification
was
unexpectedly
dug
out
of
the
musty
archives
of
the
british
patent
office
and
brought
into
the
light
the
announcement
of
siemens
and
wheatstone
came
at
an
apter
time
than
hjorth
and
was
more
conspicuously
made
above
all
in
the
affluent
and
enterprising
hands
of
the
brothers
siemens
it
was
not
suffered
to
lie
sterile
and
the
siemens
machine
was
its
offspring
this
dynamo
as
is
well
known
differs
from
those
of
gramme
and
paccinotti
chiefly
in
the
longitudinal
winding
of
the
armature
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
it
here
it
has
been
adapted
by
its
inventors
to
all
kinds
of
electrical
work
electrotyping
telegraphy
electric
lighting
and
the
propulsion
of
vehicles
the
first
electric
tramway
run
at
berlin
in
was
followed
by
another
at
dusseldorf
in
and
a
third
at
paris
in
with
all
of
these
the
name
of
werner
siemens
was
chiefly
associated
but
william
siemens
had
also
taken
up
the
matter
and
established
at
his
country
house
of
sherwood
near
tunbridge
wells
an
arrangement
of
dynamos
and
by
which
the
power
of
a
neighbouring
stream
was
made
to
light
the
house
cut
chaff
turn
and
perform
other
household
duties
more
recently
the
construction
of
the
electric
railway
from
portrush
to
bushmills
at
the
giant
causeway
engaged
his
attention
and
this
the
first
work
of
its
kind
in
the
united
kingdom
and
to
all
appearance
the
pioneer
of
many
similar
lines
was
one
of
his
very
last
undertakings
in
the
recent
development
of
electric
lighting
william
siemens
whose
fame
had
been
steadily
growing
was
a
recognised
leader
although
he
himself
made
no
great
discoveries
therein
as
a
public
man
and
a
manufacturer
of
great
resources
his
influence
in
assisting
the
introduction
of
the
light
has
been
immense
the
number
of
siemens
machines
and
siemens
electric
lamps
together
with
measuring
instruments
such
as
the
siemens
which
has
been
supplied
to
different
parts
of
the
world
by
the
firm
of
which
he
was
the
head
is
very
considerable
and
probably
exceeds
that
of
any
other
manufacturer
at
least
in
this
country
employing
a
staff
of
skilful
assistants
to
develop
many
of
his
ideas
siemens
was
able
to
produce
a
great
variety
of
electrical
instruments
for
measuring
and
other
auxiliary
purposes
all
of
which
bear
the
name
of
his
firm
and
have
proved
exceedingly
useful
in
a
practical
sense
among
the
most
interesting
of
siemens
investigations
were
his
experiments
on
the
influence
of
the
electric
light
in
promoting
the
growth
of
plants
carried
out
during
the
winter
of
in
the
greenhouses
of
sherwood
these
experiments
showed
that
plants
do
not
require
a
period
of
rest
but
continue
to
grow
if
light
and
other
necessaries
are
supplied
to
them
siemens
enhanced
the
daylight
and
as
it
were
prolonged
it
through
the
night
by
means
of
arc
lamps
with
the
result
of
forcing
excellent
fruit
and
flowers
to
their
maturity
before
the
natural
time
in
this
climate
while
siemens
was
testing
the
chemical
and
influence
of
the
electric
arc
light
he
was
also
occupied
in
trying
its
temperature
and
heating
power
with
an
furnace
consisting
of
a
plumbago
crucible
having
two
carbon
electrodes
entering
it
in
such
a
manner
that
the
voltaic
arc
could
be
produced
within
it
he
succeeded
in
fusing
a
variety
of
refractory
metals
in
a
comparatively
short
time
thus
a
pound
of
broken
files
was
melted
in
a
cold
crucible
in
thirteen
minutes
a
result
which
is
not
surprising
when
we
consider
that
the
temperature
of
the
voltaic
arc
as
measured
by
siemens
and
rosetti
is
between
and
deg
centigrade
or
about
that
of
the
probable
temperature
of
the
sun
sir
humphry
davy
was
the
first
to
observe
the
extraordinary
fusing
power
of
the
voltaic
arc
but
siemens
first
applied
it
to
a
practical
purpose
in
his
electric
furnace
always
ready
to
turn
his
inventive
genius
in
any
direction
the
introduction
of
the
electric
light
which
had
given
an
impetus
to
improvement
in
the
methods
of
utilising
gas
led
him
to
design
a
regenerative
gas
lamp
which
is
now
employed
on
a
small
scale
in
this
country
either
for
street
lighting
or
in
and
public
halls
in
this
burner
as
in
the
regenerative
furnace
the
products
of
combustion
are
made
to
warm
up
the
air
and
gas
which
go
to
feed
the
flame
and
the
effect
is
a
full
and
brilliant
light
with
some
economy
of
fuel
the
use
of
for
heating
purposes
was
another
subject
which
he
took
up
with
characteristic
earnestness
and
he
advocated
for
a
time
the
use
of
gas
stoves
and
fires
in
preference
to
those
which
burn
coal
not
only
on
account
of
their
cleanliness
and
convenience
but
on
the
score
of
preventing
fogs
in
great
cities
by
checking
the
discharge
of
smoke
into
the
atmosphere
he
designed
a
regenerative
gas
and
coke
fireplace
in
which
the
ingoing
air
was
warmed
by
heat
conducted
from
the
back
part
of
the
grate
and
by
practical
trials
in
his
own
office
calculated
the
economy
of
the
system
the
interest
in
this
question
however
died
away
after
the
close
of
the
smoke
abatement
exhibition
and
the
experiments
of
aiken
of
edinburgh
showed
how
futile
was
the
hope
that
gas
fires
would
prevent
fogs
altogether
they
might
indeed
ameliorate
the
noxious
character
of
a
fog
by
checking
the
discharge
of
soot
into
the
atmosphere
but
aiken
experiments
showed
that
particles
of
gas
were
in
themselves
capable
of
condensing
the
moisture
of
the
air
upon
them
the
great
scheme
of
siemens
for
making
london
a
smokeless
city
by
manufacturing
gas
at
the
and
leading
it
in
pipes
from
street
to
street
would
not
have
rendered
it
altogether
a
fogless
one
though
the
coke
and
gas
fires
would
certainly
have
reduced
the
quantity
of
soot
launched
into
the
air
siemens
scheme
was
rejected
by
a
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
on
the
somewhat
mistaken
ground
that
if
the
plan
were
as
profitable
as
siemens
supposed
it
would
have
been
put
in
practice
long
ago
by
private
enterprise
from
the
problem
of
heating
a
room
the
mind
of
siemens
also
passed
to
the
maintenance
of
solar
fires
and
occupied
itself
with
the
supply
of
fuel
to
the
sun
some
physicists
have
attributed
the
continuance
of
solar
heat
to
the
contraction
of
the
solar
mass
and
others
to
the
impact
of
cometary
matter
imbued
with
the
idea
of
regeneration
and
seeking
in
nature
for
that
thrift
of
power
which
he
as
an
inventor
had
always
aimed
at
siemens
suggested
a
hypothesis
on
which
the
sun
conserves
its
heat
by
a
circulation
of
its
fuel
in
space
the
elements
dissociated
in
the
intense
heat
of
the
glowing
orb
rush
into
the
cooler
regions
of
space
and
recombine
to
stream
again
towards
the
sun
where
the
process
is
renewed
the
hypothesis
was
a
daring
one
and
evoked
a
great
deal
of
discussion
to
which
the
author
replied
with
interest
afterwards
reprinting
the
controversy
in
a
volume
on
the
conservation
of
solar
energy
whether
true
or
not
and
time
will
probably
decide
the
solar
hypothesis
of
siemens
revealed
its
author
in
a
new
light
hitherto
he
had
been
the
ingenious
inventor
the
enterprising
man
of
business
the
successful
engineer
but
now
he
took
a
prominent
place
in
the
ranks
of
pure
science
and
speculative
philosophy
the
remarkable
breadth
of
his
mind
and
the
abundance
of
his
energies
were
also
illustrated
by
the
active
part
he
played
in
public
matters
connected
with
the
progress
of
science
his
munificent
gifts
in
the
cause
of
education
as
much
as
his
achievements
in
science
had
brought
him
a
popular
reputation
of
the
best
kind
and
his
public
utterances
in
connection
with
smoke
abatement
the
electric
light
electric
railways
and
other
topics
of
current
interest
had
rapidly
brought
him
into
a
foremost
place
among
english
scientific
men
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
siemens
advanced
from
the
shade
of
mere
professional
celebrity
into
the
strong
light
of
public
fame
president
of
the
british
association
in
and
knighted
in
siemens
was
a
member
of
numerous
learned
societies
both
at
home
and
abroad
in
he
became
a
member
of
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
and
in
he
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
he
was
twice
president
of
the
society
of
telegraph
engineers
and
the
institution
of
mechanical
engineers
besides
being
a
member
of
council
of
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
and
a
of
the
royal
institution
the
society
of
arts
as
we
have
already
seen
was
the
first
to
honour
him
in
the
country
of
his
adoption
by
awarding
him
a
gold
medal
for
his
regenerative
condenser
in
and
in
he
became
its
chairman
many
honours
were
conferred
upon
him
in
the
course
of
his
career
the
telford
prize
in
gold
medals
at
the
various
great
exhibitions
including
that
of
paris
in
and
a
grand
prix
at
the
earlier
paris
exhibition
of
for
his
regenerative
furnace
in
he
received
the
royal
albert
medal
for
his
researches
on
heat
and
in
the
bessemer
medal
of
the
iron
and
steel
institute
moreover
a
few
days
before
his
death
the
council
of
the
institution
of
civil
engineers
awarded
him
the
howard
quinquennial
prize
for
his
improvements
in
the
manufacture
of
iron
and
steel
at
the
request
of
his
widow
it
took
the
form
of
a
bronze
copy
of
the
a
piece
of
statuary
by
lough
originally
exhibited
at
the
great
exhibition
of
in
the
crystal
palace
in
the
university
of
oxford
conferred
upon
him
the
high
distinction
of
doctor
of
civil
law
and
besides
being
a
member
of
several
foreign
societies
he
was
a
dignitario
of
the
brazilian
order
of
the
rose
and
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
rich
in
honours
and
the
appreciation
of
his
contemporaries
in
the
prime
of
his
working
power
and
influence
for
good
and
at
the
very
climax
of
his
career
sir
william
siemens
was
called
away
the
news
of
his
death
came
with
a
shock
of
surprise
for
hardly
any
one
knew
he
had
been
ill
he
died
on
the
evening
of
monday
november
at
nine
a
fortnight
before
while
returning
from
a
managers
meeting
of
the
royal
institution
in
company
with
his
friend
sir
frederick
bramwell
he
tripped
upon
the
kerbstone
of
the
pavement
after
crossing
hamilton
place
piccadilly
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
with
his
left
arm
under
him
though
a
good
deal
shaken
by
the
fall
he
attended
at
his
office
in
queen
anne
gate
westminster
the
next
and
for
several
following
days
but
the
exertion
proved
too
much
for
him
and
almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
busy
life
he
was
compelled
to
lay
up
on
his
last
visit
to
the
office
he
was
engaged
most
of
the
time
in
dictating
to
his
private
secretary
a
large
portion
of
the
address
which
he
intended
to
deliver
as
chairman
of
the
council
of
the
society
of
arts
this
was
on
thursday
november
and
the
following
saturday
he
awoke
early
in
the
morning
with
an
acute
pain
about
the
heart
and
a
sense
of
coldness
in
the
lower
limbs
hot
baths
and
friction
removed
the
pain
from
which
he
did
not
suffer
much
afterwards
a
slight
congestion
of
the
left
lung
was
also
relieved
and
sir
william
had
so
far
recovered
that
he
could
leave
his
room
on
saturday
the
he
was
to
have
gone
for
a
change
of
air
to
his
country
seat
at
sherwood
but
on
wednesday
the
he
appears
to
have
caught
a
chill
which
affected
his
lungs
for
that
night
he
was
seized
with
a
shortness
of
breath
and
a
difficulty
in
breathing
though
not
actually
confined
to
bed
he
never
left
his
room
again
on
the
last
day
and
within
four
hours
of
his
death
we
are
told
his
two
medical
attendants
after
consultation
spoke
so
hopefully
of
the
future
that
no
one
was
prepared
for
the
sudden
end
which
was
then
so
near
in
the
evening
while
he
was
sitting
in
an
very
quiet
and
calm
a
change
suddenly
came
over
his
face
and
he
died
like
one
who
falls
asleep
heart
disease
of
long
standing
aggravated
by
the
fall
was
the
immediate
cause
but
the
opinion
has
been
expressed
by
one
who
knew
him
well
that
siemens
immolated
himself
on
the
shrine
of
labour
at
any
rate
he
did
not
spare
himself
and
his
intense
devotion
to
his
work
proved
fatal
every
day
was
a
busy
one
with
siemens
his
secretary
was
with
him
in
his
residence
by
nine
nearly
every
morning
except
on
sundays
assisting
him
in
work
for
one
society
or
another
the
correction
of
proofs
or
the
dictation
of
letters
giving
official
or
scientific
advice
and
the
preparation
of
lectures
or
patent
specifications
later
on
he
hurried
across
the
park
at
racing
speed
to
his
offices
at
westminster
where
the
business
of
the
steel
company
and
the
electrical
works
of
siemens
brothers
and
company
was
transacted
as
chairman
of
these
large
undertakings
and
principal
inventor
of
the
processes
and
systems
carried
out
by
them
he
had
a
hundred
things
to
attend
to
in
connection
with
them
visitors
to
see
and
inquiries
to
answer
in
the
afternoon
and
evenings
he
was
generally
engaged
at
council
meetings
of
the
learned
societies
or
directory
meetings
of
the
companies
in
which
he
was
interested
he
was
a
man
who
took
little
or
no
leisure
and
though
he
never
appeared
to
himself
few
men
could
have
withstood
the
strain
so
long
siemens
was
buried
on
monday
november
in
kensal
green
cemetery
the
interment
was
preceded
by
a
funeral
service
held
in
westminster
abbey
and
attended
by
representatives
of
the
numerous
learned
societies
of
which
he
had
been
a
conspicuous
member
by
many
leading
men
in
all
branches
of
science
and
also
by
a
large
body
of
other
friends
and
admirers
who
thus
united
in
doing
honour
to
his
memory
and
showing
their
sense
of
the
loss
which
all
classes
had
sustained
by
his
death
siemens
was
above
all
things
a
unhasting
unresting
labour
was
the
rule
of
his
life
and
the
only
relaxation
not
to
say
recreation
which
he
seems
to
have
allowed
himself
was
a
change
of
task
or
the
calls
of
sleep
this
natural
activity
was
partly
due
to
the
spur
of
his
genius
and
partly
to
his
energetic
spirit
for
a
man
of
his
temperament
science
is
always
holding
out
new
problems
to
solve
and
fresh
promises
of
triumph
all
he
did
only
revealed
more
work
to
be
done
and
many
a
scheme
lies
buried
in
his
grave
though
siemens
was
a
man
of
varied
powers
and
occasionally
gave
himself
to
pure
speculation
in
matters
of
science
his
mind
was
essentially
practical
and
it
was
rather
as
an
engineer
than
a
discoverer
that
he
was
great
inventions
are
associated
with
his
name
not
laws
or
new
phenomena
standing
on
the
borderland
between
pure
and
applied
science
his
sympathies
were
yet
with
the
latter
and
as
the
outgoing
president
of
the
british
association
at
southport
in
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
great
workshop
of
nature
there
are
no
lines
of
demarcation
to
be
drawn
between
the
most
exalted
speculation
and
practice
the
truth
of
this
is
not
to
be
but
it
is
the
utterance
of
an
engineer
who
judges
the
merit
of
a
thing
by
its
utility
he
objected
to
the
pursuit
of
science
apart
from
its
application
and
held
that
the
man
of
science
does
most
for
his
kind
who
shows
the
world
how
to
make
use
of
scientific
results
such
a
view
was
natural
on
the
part
of
siemens
who
was
himself
a
living
representative
of
the
type
in
question
but
it
was
not
the
view
of
such
a
man
as
faraday
or
newton
whose
pure
aim
was
to
discover
truth
well
knowing
that
it
would
be
turned
to
use
thereafter
in
faraday
eyes
the
new
principle
was
a
higher
boon
than
the
appliance
which
was
founded
upon
it
tried
by
his
own
standard
however
siemens
was
a
conspicuous
benefactor
of
his
and
at
the
time
of
his
decease
he
had
become
our
leading
authority
upon
applied
science
in
electricity
he
was
a
pioneer
of
the
new
advances
and
happily
lived
to
obtain
at
least
a
pisgah
view
of
the
great
future
which
evidently
lies
before
that
pregnant
force
if
we
look
for
the
secret
of
siemens
remarkable
success
we
shall
assuredly
find
it
in
an
inventive
mind
coupled
with
a
strong
commercial
instinct
and
supported
by
a
physical
energy
which
enabled
him
to
labour
long
and
incessantly
it
is
told
that
when
a
mechanical
problem
was
brought
to
him
for
solution
he
would
suggest
six
ways
of
overcoming
the
difficulty
three
of
which
would
be
impracticable
the
others
feasible
and
one
at
least
successful
from
this
we
gather
that
his
mind
was
fertile
in
expedients
the
large
works
which
he
established
are
also
a
proof
that
unlike
most
inventors
he
did
not
lose
his
interest
in
an
invention
or
forsake
it
for
another
before
it
had
been
brought
into
the
market
on
the
contrary
he
was
never
satisfied
with
an
invention
until
it
was
put
into
practical
operation
to
the
ordinary
observer
siemens
did
not
betray
any
signs
of
the
untiring
energy
that
possessed
him
his
countenance
was
usually
serene
and
tranquil
as
that
of
a
thinker
rather
than
a
man
of
action
his
demeanour
was
cool
and
collected
his
words
few
and
in
his
manner
as
well
as
in
his
works
there
was
no
useless
waste
of
power
to
the
young
he
was
kind
and
sympathetic
hearing
encouraging
advising
a
good
master
a
firm
friend
his
very
presence
had
a
calm
and
orderly
influence
on
those
about
him
which
when
he
presided
at
a
public
meeting
insensibly
introduced
a
gracious
tone
the
diffident
took
heart
before
him
and
the
presumptuous
were
checked
the
virtues
which
accompanied
him
into
public
life
did
not
desert
him
in
private
in
losing
him
we
have
lost
not
only
a
powerful
intellect
but
a
bright
example
and
an
amiable
man

was
introduced
to
the

of
a

the

charles

died
in

extravagance
and
high

charles
was
a
useful
officer
and
an
amiable
gentleman
but
lacking
energy
and
talent
he
never
rose
above
the
grade
of
commander
and
was
superseded
after
years
of
service
he
is
represented
as
a
brave
and
affectionate
sailor
who
on
one
occasion
saved
several
men
from
suffocation
by
a
burning

at
the
risk
of

henrietta
camilla
jackson
his
wife
was
a
woman
of
a
strong
and
energetic
character
without
beauty
of
countenance
she
possessed
the
art
of
pleasing
and
in
default
of
genius
she
was
endowed
with
a
variety
of
gifts
she
played
the
harp
sang
and
sketched
with
native
art
at
seventeen
on
hearing
pasta
sing
in
paris
she
sought
out
the

and
solicited
lessons
pasta
on
hearing
her
sing
encouraged
her
and
recommended
a
teacher
she
wrote
novels
which
however
failed
to
make
their
mark
at
forty
on
losing
her
voice
she
took
to
playing
the
piano
practising
eight
hours
a
day
and
when
she
was

sixty
she
began

was
henry
charles
fleeming
jenkin
generally
called
fleeming
jenkin
after
admiral
fleeming
one
of
his
father
patrons
he
was
born
on
march
in
a
building
of
the
government
near
dungeness
his
father
at
that
time
being
on
the
service
his
versatility
was
evidently
derived
from
his
mother
who
owing
to
her
husband
frequent
absence
at
sea
and
his
weaker
character
had
the
principal
share
in
the
boy
earlier
training
jenkin
was
fortunate
in
having
an
excellent
education
his
mother
took
him
to
the
south
of
scotland
where
chiefly
at
barjarg
she
taught
him
drawing
among
other
things
and
allowed
him
to
ride
his
pony
on
the
moors
he
went
to
school
at
jedburgh
and
afterwards
to
the
edinburgh
academy
where
he
carried
off
many
prizes
among
his
schoolfellows
were
clerk
maxwell
and
peter
guthrie
tait
the
friends
of
his
maturer
life
on
the
retirement
of
his
father
the
family
removed
to
frankfort
in
partly
from
motives
of
economy
and
partly
for
the
boy
instruction
here
fleeming
and
his
father
spent
a
pleasant
time
together
sketching
old
castles
and
observing
the
customs
of
the
peasantry
fleeming
was
precocious
and
at
thirteen
had
finished
a
romance
of
three
hundred
lines
in
heroic
measure
a
scotch
novel
and
innumerable
poetical
fragments
none
of
which
are
now
extant
he
learned
german
in
frankfort
and
on
the
family
migrating
to
paris
the
following
year
he
studied
french
and
mathematics
under
a
certain
deluc
while
here
fleeming
witnessed
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
of
and
heard
the
first
shot
in
a
letter
written
to
an
old
schoolfellow
while
the
sound
still
rang
in
his
ears
and
his
hand
trembled
with
excitement
he
gives
a
boyish
account
of
the
circumstances
the
family
were
living
in
the
rue
caumartin
and
on
the
evening
of
february
he
and
his
father
were
taking
a
walk
along
the
boulevards
which
were
illuminated
for
joy
at
the
resignation
of
guizot
they
passed
the
residence
of
the
foreign
minister
which
was
guarded
with
troops
and
further
on
encountered
a
band
of
rioters
marching
along
the
street
with
torches
and
singing
the
marseillaise
after
them
came
a
rabble
of
men
and
women
of
all
sorts
rich
and
poor
some
of
them
armed
with
sticks
and
sabres
they
turned
back
with
these

with
the
spectacle

to

sprawling
in

but
tripped
up
and
those
that
went

they
were

straight
on
and

fifty
yards

in
the

was
filled
with

were
suddenly
flung
open
and
out
galloped
a
troop
of
cuirassiers
in
the
midst
of
whom
was
an
open
carriage
containing
the
king
and

the
sacking
of
the
tuileries
the
people
mounting

also
attended
an

and
gained
a
silver

for
a

from
one

his

but
on
the

captain
jenkin
took
his

to
england
and
settled
in
manchester
where
the
lad
in
was
apprenticed
to
mechanical
engineering
at
the
works
of
fairbairn
and
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
six
at
night
had
as
he
says
file
and
chip
vigorously
in
a
moleskin
suit
and
infernally
dirty
at
home
he
pursued
his
studies
and
was
for
a
time
engaged
with
bell
in
working
out
a
geometrical
method
of
arriving
at
the
proportions
of
greek
architecture
his
stay
amidst
the
smoke
and
bustle
of
manchester
though
in
striking
contrast
to
his
life
in
genoa
was
on
the
whole
agreeable
he
liked
his
work
had
the
good
spirits
of
youth
and
made
some
pleasant
friends
one
of
them
the
authoress
gaskell
even
as
a
boy
he
was
disputatious
and
his
mother
tells
of
his
having
overcome
a
consul
at
genoa
in
a
political
discussion
when
he
was
only
sixteen
from
being
on
the
subject
and
honest
he
is
as
true
as

do
not
fancy
him
a

he
is
only
a
very
true
candid
boy
i
am
so
glad
he
remains
in
all
respects
but
information
a
great
child
on
leaving
fairbairn
he
was
engaged
for
a
time
on
a
survey
for
the
proposed
lukmanier
railway
in
switzerland
and
in
he
entered
the
engineering
works
of
penn
at
greenwich
as
a
draughtsman
and
was
occupied
on
the
plans
of
a
vessel
designed
for
the
crimean
war
he
did
not
care
for
his
berth
and
complained
of
its
late
hours
his
rough
comrades
with
whom
he
had
to
be
little
like
himself
as
possible
and
his
humble
lodgings
a
dirty
green
and
through
some
streets
of
houses
luckily
he
adds
am
fond
of
my
profession
or
i
could
not
stand
this
life
there
was
probably
no
real
hardship
in
his
present
situation
and
thousands
of
young
engineers
go
through
the
like
experience
at
the
outset
of
their
career
without
a
murmur
and
even
with
enjoyment
but
jenkin
had
been
his
mother
pet
until
then
with
a
girl
delicate
training
and
probably
felt
the
change
from
home
more
keenly
on
that
account
at
night
he
read
engineering
and
mathematics
or
carlyle
and
the
poets
and
cheered
his
drooping
spirits
with
frequent
trips
to
london
to
see
his
mother
another
social
pleasure
was
his
visits
to
the
house
of
alfred
austin
a
barrister
who
became
permanent
secretary
to
her
office
of
works
and
public
buildings
and
retired
in
with
the
title
of
his
wife
eliza
barron
was
the
youngest
daughter
of
barron
a
gentleman
of
norwich
the
son
of
a
rich
saddler
or
in
the
borough
who
when
a
child
had
been
patted
on
the
head
in
his
father
shop
by
johnson
while
canvassing
for
thrale
jenkin
had
been
introduced
to
the
austins
by
a
letter
from
gaskell
and
was
charmed
with
the
atmosphere
of
their
choice
home
where
intellectual
conversation
was
happily
united
with
kind
and
courteous
manners
without
any
pretence
or
affectation
of
the
austins
says
stevenson
in
his
memoir
of
jenkin
to
which
we
are
much
indebted
full
of
high
spirits
each
practised
something
of
the
same
repression
no
sharp
word
was
uttered
in
the
house
the
same
point
of
honour
ruled
them
a
guest
was
sacred
and
stood
within
the
pale
from
criticism
in
short
the
austins
were
truly
hospitable
and
cultured
not
merely
so
in
form
and
appearance
it
was
a
rare
privilege
and
preservative
for
a
solitary
young
man
in
jenkin
position
to
have
the
entry
into
such
elevating
society
and
he
appreciated
his
good
fortune
annie
austin
their
only
child
had
been
highly
educated
and
knew
greek
among
other
things
though
jenkin
loved
and
admired
her
parents
he
did
not
at
first
care
for
annie
who
on
her
part
thought
him
vain
and
by
no
means
stevenson
hints
that
she
vanquished
his
stubborn
heart
by
correcting
a
quantity
of
his
one
day
for
he
was
the
man
to
reflect
over
a
correction
and
the
castigator
be
this
as
it
may
jenkin
by
degrees
fell
deeply
in
love
with
her
he
was
poor
and
nameless
and
this
made
him
diffident
but
the
liking
of
her
parents
for
him
gave
him
hope
moreover
he
had
entered
the
service
of
liddell
and
gordon
who
were
engaged
in
the
new
work
of
submarine
telegraphy
which
satisfied
his
aspirations
and
promised
him
a
successful
career
with
this
confidence
in
his
future
he
solicited
the
austins
for
leave
to
court
their
daughter
and
it
was
not
withheld
austin
consented
freely
and
austin
only
reserved
the
right
to
inquire
into
his
character
neither
of
them
mentioned
his
income
or
prospects
and
jenkin
overcome
by
their
disinterestedness
exclaimed
in
one
of
his
letters
these
people
the
same
as
other
people
thus
permitted
he
addressed
himself
to
annie
and
was
nearly
rejected
for
his
pains
miss
austin
seems
to
have
resented
his
courtship
of
her
parents
first
but
the
mother
favour
and
his
own
spirited
behaviour
saved
him
and
won
her
consent
then
followed
one
of
the
happiest
epochs
in
jenkin
life
after
leaving
penn
he
worked
at
railway
engineering
for
a
time
under
liddell
and
gordon
and
in
became
engineer
to
newall
of
gateshead
who
shared
the
work
of
making
the
first
atlantic
cable
with
glass
elliott
of
greenwich
jenkin
was
busy
designing
and
fitting
up
machinery
for
cableships
and
making
electrical
experiments
am
half
crazy
with
work
he
wrote
to
his
betrothed
like
it
though
it
like
a
good
ball
the
excitement
carries
you
through
again
he
wrote
profession
gives
me
all
the
excitement
and
interest
i
ever
hope
am
at
the
works
till
ten
and
sometimes
till
eleven
but
i
have
a
nice
office
to
sit
in
with
a
fire
to
myself
and
bright
brass
scientific
instruments
all
round
me
and
books
to
read
and
experiments
to
make
and
enjoy
myself
amazingly
i
find
the
study
of
electricity
so
entertaining
that
i
am
apt
to
neglect
my
other
shall
i
compare
them
to
he
writes
of
some
electrical
experiments
new
song
or
a
greek
play
in
the
spring
of
he
was
fitting
out
the
elba
at
birkenhead
for
his
first
telegraph
cruise
it
appears
that
in
henry
brett
attempted
to
lay
a
cable
across
the
mediterranean
between
cape
spartivento
in
the
south
of
sardinia
and
a
point
near
bona
on
the
coast
of
algeria
it
was
a
cable
of
six
wires
or
conductors
and
manufactured
by
glass
elliott
of
greenwich
a
firm
which
afterwards
combined
with
the
company
and
became
the
existing
telegraph
construction
and
maintenance
company
brett
laid
the
cable
from
the
result
a
sailing
ship
in
tow
instead
of
a
more
manageable
steamer
and
meeting
with
fathoms
of
water
when
miles
from
land
the
cable
ran
out
so
fast
that
a
tangled
skein
came
up
out
of
the
hold
and
the
line
had
to
be
severed
having
only
miles
on
board
to
span
the
whole
distance
of
miles
he
grappled
the
lost
cable
near
the
shore
raised
it
and
or
passed
it
over
the
ship
for
some
twenty
miles
then
cut
it
leaving
the
seaward
end
on
the
bottom
he
then
spliced
the
ship
cable
to
the
shoreward
end
and
resumed
his
but
after
seventy
miles
in
all
were
laid
another
rapid
rush
of
cable
took
place
and
brett
was
obliged
to
cut
and
abandon
the
line
another
attempt
was
made
the
following
year
but
with
no
better
success
brett
then
tried
to
lay
a
cable
from
the
steamer
dutchman
but
owing
to
the
deep
water
in
some
places
fathoms
its
egress
was
so
rapid
that
when
he
came
to
a
few
miles
from
galita
his
destination
on
the
algerian
coast
he
had
not
enough
cable
to
reach
the
land
he
therefore
telegraphed
to
london
for
more
cable
to
be
made
and
sent
out
while
the
ship
remained
there
holding
to
the
end
for
five
days
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
sending
and
receiving
messages
but
heavy
weather
came
on
and
the
cable
parted
having
it
is
said
been
chafed
through
by
rubbing
on
the
bottom
after
that
brett
went
home
it
was
to
recover
the
lost
cable
of
these
expeditions
that
the
elba
was
got
ready
for
sea
jenkin
had
fitted
her
out
the
year
before
for
laying
the
cagliari
to
malta
and
corfu
cables
but
on
this
occasion
she
was
better
equipped
she
had
a
new
machine
for
picking
up
the
cable
and
a
sheave
or
pulley
at
the
bows
for
it
to
run
over
both
designed
by
jenkin
together
with
a
variety
of
wooden
buoys
ropes
and
chains
liddell
assisted
by
webb
and
fleeming
jenkin
were
in
charge
of
the
expedition
the
latter
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
electrical
work
his
care
being
the
deck
machinery
for
raising
the
cable
but
it
entailed
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
which
was
flattering
and
agreeable
to
a
young
man
of
his
parts
own
i
like
responsibility
he
wrote
to
miss
austin
while
fitting
up
the
vessel
flatters
one
and
then
your
father
might
say
i
have
more
to
gain
than
lose
moreover
i
do
like
this
bloodless
painless
combat
with
wood
and
iron
forcing
the
stubborn
rascals
to
do
my
will
licking
the
clumsy
cubs
into
an
active
shape
seeing
the
child
of
thought
working
in
full
vigour
at
his
appointed
task
another
letter
dated
may
gives
a
picture
of
the
start
a
sailor
will
join
us
till
the
last
moment
and
then
just
as
the
ship
forges
ahead
through
the
narrow
pass
beds
and
baggage
fly
on
board
the
men
half
tipsy
clutch
at
the
rigging
the
captain
swears
the
women
scream
and
sob
the
crowd
cheer
and
laugh
while
one
or
two
pretty
little
girls
stand
still
and
cry
outright
regardless
of
all
eyes
the
elba
arrived
at
bona
on
june
and
jenkin
landed
at
fort
genova
on
cape
hamrah
where
some
arabs
were
building
a
land
line
was
a
strange
scene
he
writes
more
novel
than
i
had
imagined
the
high
steep
bank
covered
with
rich
spicy
vegetation
of
which
i
hardly
knew
one
plant
the
dwarf
palm
with
leaves
growing
about
two
feet
high
forms
the
staple
verdure
after
dining
in
fort
genova
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
watch
the
sailors
ordering
the
arabs
about
under
the
term
johnny
he
began
to
tire
of
the
scene
although
as
he
confesses
he
had
willingly
paid
more
money
for
less
strange
and
lovely
sights
jenkin
was
not
a
dreamer
he
disliked
being
idle
and
if
he
had
had
a
pencil
he
would
have
amused
himself
in
sketching
what
he
saw
that
his
eyes
were
busy
is
evident
from
the
particulars
given
in
his
letter
where
he
notes
the
yellow
thistles
and
gowans
which
grow
there
along
with
the
cistus
and
the
they
left
bona
on
june
and
after
calling
at
cagliari
and
chia
arrived
at
cape
spartivento
on
the
morning
of
june
the
coast
here
is
a
low
range
of
heathy
hills
with
brilliant
green
bushes
and
marshy
pools
webb
remarks
that
its
reputation
for
fever
was
so
bad
as
to
cause
italian
to
sheer
off
in
passing
by
jenkin
suffered
a
little
from
malaria
but
of
a
different
origin
number
of
the
saturday
review
here
he
writes
reads
so
hot
and
feverish
so
and
unhealthy
in
the
midst
of
dear
nature
hills
and
sea
with
good
wholesome
work
to
do
there
were
several
pieces
of
submerged
cable
to
lift
two
with
their
ends
on
shore
and
one
or
two
lying
out
at
sea
next
day
operations
were
begun
on
the
shore
end
which
had
become
buried
under
the
sand
and
could
not
be
raised
without
grappling
after
attempts
to
free
the
cable
from
the
sand
in
small
boats
the
elba
came
up
to
help
and
anchored
in
shallow
water
about
sunset
curiously
enough
the
anchor
happened
to
hook
and
so
discover
the
cable
which
was
thereupon
grappled
cut
and
the
sea
end
brought
on
board
over
the
bow
sheave
after
being
passed
six
times
round
the
drum
it
was
led
into
the
hold
and
the
elba
slowly
forged
ahead
hauling
in
the
cable
from
the
bottom
as
she
proceeded
at
nine
she
anchored
for
the
night
some
distance
from
the
shore
and
at
three
next
morning
resumed
her
picking
up
a
small
delay
for
one
or
two
improvements
i
had
seen
to
be
necessary
last
night
writes
jenkin
engine
started
and
since
that
time
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
half
an
hour
stoppage
a
rope
to
splice
a
block
to
change
a
wheel
to
oil
an
old
rusted
anchor
to
disengage
from
the
cable
which
brought
it
up
these
have
been
our
only
obstructions
sixty
seventy
eighty
a
hundred
a
hundred
and
twenty
revolutions
at
last
my
little
engine
tears
away
the
even
black
rope
comes
straight
out
of
the
blue
heaving
water
passes
slowly
round
an
pulley
five
feet
in
diameter
aft
past
a
vicious
nipper
to
bring
all
up
should
anything
go
wrong
through
a
gentle
guide
on
to
a
huge
bluff
drum
who
wraps
him
round
his
body
and
says
come
you
must
as
plain
as
drum
can
speak
the
chattering
pauls
say
got
him
i
got
him
he
ca
come
back
whilst
black
cable
much
slacker
and
easier
in
mind
and
body
is
taken
by
a
slim
and
passed
down
into
the
huge
hold
where
half
a
dozen
men
put
him
comfortably
to
bed
after
his
exertion
in
rising
from
his
long
bath
am
very
glad
i
am
here
for
my
machines
are
my
own
children
and
i
look
on
their
little
failings
with
a
parent
eye
and
lead
them
into
the
path
of
duty
with
gentleness
and
firmness
i
am
naturally
in
good
spirits
but
keep
very
quiet
for
misfortunes
may
arise
at
any
instant
moreover
my
apparatus
will
be
wanted
should
all
go
well
and
that
will
be
another
nervous
operation
fifteen
miles
are
safely
in
but
no
one
knows
better
than
i
do
that
nothing
is
done
till
all
is
done
june
would
amuse
you
to
see
how
cool
in
head
and
jolly
everybody
is
a
testy
word
now
and
then
shows
the
nerves
are
strained
a
little
but
every
one
laughs
and
makes
his
little
jokes
as
if
it
were
all
in
fun
enjoy
it
very
much
june
now
at
blows
a
pretty
stiff
gale
and
the
sea
has
also
risen
and
the
elba
bows
rise
and
fall
about
nine
feet
we
make
twelve
pitches
to
the
minute
and
the
poor
cable
must
feel
very
by
this
time
we
are
quite
unable
to
do
anything
and
continue
riding
at
anchor
in
one
thousand
fathoms
the
engines
going
constantly
so
as
to
keep
the
ship
bows
close
up
to
the
cable
which
by
this
means
hangs
nearly
vertical
and
sustains
no
strain
but
that
caused
by
its
own
weight
and
the
pitching
of
the
vessel
we
were
all
up
at
four
but
the
weather
entirely
forbade
work
for
so
some
went
to
bed
and
most
lay
down
making
up
our
as
we
nautically
term
our
loss
of
sleep
i
must
say
liddell
is
a
fine
fellow
and
keeps
his
patience
and
his
temper
wonderfully
and
yet
how
he
does
fret
and
fume
about
trifles
at
home
june
some
odd
chance
a
times
of
june
has
found
its
way
on
board
through
the
agency
of
a
wretched
old
peasant
who
watches
the
end
of
the
line
here
a
long
account
of
breakages
in
the
atlantic
trial
trip
we
grapple
for
the
heavy
cable
eight
tons
to
the
mile
i
long
to
have
a
tug
at
him
he
may
puzzle
me
and
though
misfortunes
or
rather
difficulties
are
a
bore
at
the
time
life
when
working
with
cables
is
tame
without
hurrah
he
is
hooked
the
big
fellow
almost
at
the
first
cast
he
hangs
under
our
bows
looking
so
huge
and
imposing
that
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
afraid
of
him
june
went
to
a
little
bay
called
chia
where
a
stream
falls
into
the
sea
and
took
in
water
this
is
rather
a
long
operation
so
i
went
up
the
valley
with
liddell
the
coast
here
consists
of
rocky
mountains
to
feet
high
covered
with
shrubs
of
a
brilliant
green
on
landing
our
first
amusement
was
watching
the
hundreds
of
large
fish
who
lazily
swam
in
shoals
about
the
river
the
big
canes
on
the
further
side
hold
numberless
tortoises
we
are
told
but
see
none
for
just
now
they
prefer
taking
a
siesta
a
little
further
on
and
what
is
this
with
large
pink
flowers
in
such
abundance
the
oleander
in
full
flower
at
first
i
fear
to
pluck
them
thinking
they
must
be
cultivated
and
valuable
but
soon
the
banks
show
a
long
line
of
thick
tall
shrubs
one
mass
of
glorious
pink
and
green
set
there
in
a
little
valley
whose
rocks
gleam
out
blue
and
purple
colours
such
as
only
dare
attempt
shining
out
hard
and
amongst
the
clumps
of
plants
cistus
and
many
other
evergreens
whose
names
alas
i
know
not
the
cistus
is
brown
now
the
rest
all
deep
and
brilliant
green
large
herds
of
cattle
browse
on
the
baked
deposit
at
the
foot
of
these
large
crags
one
or
two
herdsmen
in
sheepskin
kilts
ask
for
cigars
partridges
whirr
up
on
either
side
of
us
pigeons
coo
and
nightingales
sing
amongst
the
blooming
oleander
we
get
six
sheep
and
many
fowls
too
from
the
priest
of
the
small
village
and
then
run
back
to
spartivento
and
make
preparations
for
the
morning
june
short
length
of
the
we
have
picked
up
was
covered
at
places
with
beautiful
sprays
of
coral
twisted
and
twined
with
shells
of
those
small
fairy
animals
we
saw
in
the
aquarium
at
home
poor
little
things
they
died
at
once
with
their
little
bells
and
delicate
bright
tints
june
after
hour
i
stand
on
the
picking
off
little
specimens
of
polypi
and
coral
or
lie
on
the
saloon
deck
reading
back
numbers
of
the
times
till
something
hitches
and
then
all
is
once
more
there
are
awnings
all
along
the
ship
and
a
most
ancient
and
smell
from
the
decaying
polypi
beneath
june
the
cable
was
often
a
lovely
sight
coming
out
of
the
water
one
large
incrustation
of
delicate
corals
and
long
white
curling
shells
no
portion
of
the
dirty
black
wire
was
visible
instead
we
had
a
garland
of
soft
pink
with
little
scarlet
sprays
and
white
enamel
intermixed
all
was
fragile
however
and
could
hardly
be
secured
in
safety
and
inexorable
iron
crushed
the
tender
leaves
to
atoms
june
whole
day
spent
in
dredging
without
success
this
operation
consists
in
allowing
the
ship
to
drift
slowly
across
the
line
where
you
expect
the
cable
to
be
while
at
the
end
of
a
long
rope
fast
either
to
the
bow
or
stern
a
grapnel
drags
along
the
ground
the
grapnel
is
a
small
anchor
made
like
four
tied
back
to
back
when
the
rope
gets
taut
the
ship
is
stopped
and
the
grapnel
hauled
up
to
the
surface
in
the
hopes
of
finding
the
cable
on
its
prongs
i
am
much
discontented
with
myself
for
idly
lounging
about
and
reading
westward
ho
for
the
second
time
instead
of
taking
to
electricity
or
picking
up
nautical
information
during
the
latter
part
of
the
work
much
of
the
cable
was
found
to
be
looped
and
twisted
into
from
having
been
so
slackly
laid
and
two
immense
tangled
skeins
were
raised
on
board
one
by
means
of
the
and
tackle
photographs
of
this
ravelled
cable
were
for
a
long
time
exhibited
as
a
curiosity
in
the
windows
of
newall
co
shop
in
the
strand
where
we
remember
to
have
seen
them
by
july
the
whole
of
the
cable
had
been
recovered
and
a
portion
of
the
cable
the
rest
being
abandoned
as
unfit
for
use
owing
to
its
twisted
condition
their
work
was
over
but
an
unfortunate
accident
marred
its
conclusion
on
the
evening
of
the
the
first
mate
while
on
the
water
unshackling
a
buoy
was
struck
in
the
back
by
a
fluke
of
the
ship
anchor
as
she
drifted
and
so
severely
injured
that
he
lay
for
many
weeks
at

knowledge
of
languages
made
him
useful
as
an
interpreter
but
in
mentioning
this
incident
to
miss
austin
he
writes
no
fortune
would
i
be
a
doctor
to
witness
these
scenes
continually
pain
is
a
terrible
thing
in
the
beginning
of
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
sir
william
thomson
his
future
friend
and
partner
lewis
gordon
of
newall
afterwards
the
earliest
professor
of
engineering
in
a
british
university
was
then
in
glasgow
seeing
sir
william
instruments
for
testing
and
signalling
on
the
first
atlantic
cable
during
the
six
weeks
of
its
working
gordon
said
he
should
like
to
show
them
to
young
man
of
remarkable
ability
engaged
at
their
birkenhead
works
and
jenkin
being
telegraphed
for
arrived
next
morning
and
spent
a
week
in
glasgow
mostly
in
sir
william
and
laboratory
at
the
old
college
sir
william
tells
us
that
he
was
struck
not
only
with
brightness
and
ability
but
with
his
resolution
to
understand
everything
spoken
of
to
see
if
possible
thoroughly
into
every
difficult
question
and
to
slur
over
nothing
soon
found
he
remarks
thoroughness
of
honesty
was
as
strongly
engrained
in
the
scientific
as
in
the
moral
side
of
his
character
their
talk
was
chiefly
on
the
electric
telegraph
but
jenkin
was
eager
too
on
the
subject
of
physics
after
staying
a
week
he
returned
to
the
factory
but
he
began
experiments
and
corresponded
briskly
with
sir
william
about
cable
work
that
great
electrician
indeed
seems
to
have
infected
his
visitor
during
their
brief
contact
with
the
magnetic
force
of
his
personality
and
enthusiasm
the
year
was
propitious
and
in
addition
to
this
friend
fortune
about
the
same
time
bestowed
a
still
better
gift
on
jenkin
on
saturday
february
during
a
four
days
leave
he
was
married
to
miss
austin
at
northiam
returning
to
his
work
the
following
tuesday
this
was
the
great
event
of
his
life
he
was
strongly
attached
to
his
wife
and
his
letters
reveal
a
warmth
of
affection
a
chivalry
of
sentiment
and
even
a
romance
of
expression
which
a
casual
observer
would
never
have
suspected
in
him
jenkin
seemed
to
the
outside
world
a
man
without
a
heart
and
yet
we
find
him
saying
in
the
year
may
write
novels
and
other
people
may
write
poems
but
not
a
man
or
woman
among
them
can
say
how
happy
a
man
can
be
who
is
desperately
in
love
with
his
wife
after
ten
years
of
marriage
five
weeks
before
his
death
he
wrote
to
her
first
letter
from
bournemouth
gives
me
heavenly
pleasure
for
which
i
thank
heaven
and
you
too
who
are
my
heaven
on
earth
during
the
summer
he
enjoyed
another
telegraph
cruise
in
the
mediterranean
a
sea
which
for
its
classical
memories
its
lovely
climate
and
diversified
scenes
is
by
far
the
most
interesting
in
the
world
this
time
the
elba
was
to
lay
a
cable
from
the
greek
islands
of
syra
and
candia
to
egypt
is
a
pleasant
mode
of
travel
many
of
those
on
board
the
ship
are
friends
and
comrades
in
former
expeditions
and
all
are
engaged
in
the
same
venture
some
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
both
in
and
out
of
the
beaten
track
they
have
curious
to
spin
and
useful
hints
or
scraps
of
worldly
wisdom
to
bestow
the
voyage
out
is
like
a
holiday
excursion
for
it
is
only
the
laying
that
is
arduous
and
even
that
is
lightened
by
excitement
glimpses
are
got
of
spots
where
the
cable
is
landed
perhaps
on
the
verge
of
the
primeval
forest
or
near
the
port
of
a
modern
city
or
by
the
site
of
some
ruined
monument
of
the
past
the
very
magic
of
the
craft
and
its
benefit
to
the
world
are
a
source
of
pleasure
to
the
engineer
who
is
generally
made
much
of
in
the
distant
parts
he
has
come
to
join
no
doubt
there
are
hardships
to
be
borne
broken
rest
and
anxiety
about
the
work
for
cables
are
apt
suddenly
to
fail
and
the
ocean
is
treacherous
but
with
all
its
drawbacks
this
happy
mixture
of
changing
travel
and
profitable
labour
is
very
attractive
especially
to
a
young
man
the
following
extracts
from
letters
to
his
wife
will
illustrate
the
nature
of
the
work
and
also
give
an
idea
of
jenkin
clear
and
graphic
style
of
correspondence

is
the
pavement
huge
shapeless
blocks
sloping
to
a
central
gutter
from
this
base

sometimes
plaster
sometimes

to
straight
plain
flat
roofs

and
a

and
a
sprinkling
of
the
ordinary
continental
in
the
evening
i
tried
one
more
walk
in
syra
with
a
but
in
vain
endeavoured
to
amuse
myself
or
to
spend
money

first
effort

in
singing

candia
or

which
they
reached
on
may
appeared
to
jenkin
one
of
the
loveliest
sights
that
man
could
witness
may
spent
the
day
at
the
little
station
where
the
cable
was
landed
which
has
apparently
been
first
a
venetian
monastery
and
then
a
turkish
mosque
at
any
rate
the
big
dome
is
very
cool
and
the
little
ones
hold
batteries
capitally
a
handsome
young
guards
it
and
a
still
handsomer
mountaineer
is
the
servant
so
i
draw
them
and
the
monastery
and
the
hill
till
i
black
in
the
face
with
heat
and
come
on

to
hear
the
canea
cable
is
still
bad
may
arrived
in
the
morning
at
the
east
end
of
candia
and
had
a
glorious
scramble
over
the
mountains
which
seem
built
of
adamant
time
has
worn
away
the
softer
portions
of
the
rock
only
leaving
sharp
jagged
edges
of
steel

eagles
soaring
above
our
heads
old
tanks
ruins
and
desolation
at
our
feet
the
ancient

here

of
marble

the
presence
of

christians
but
now
the
desolation
of
desolations
liddell
and
i
separated
from
the
rest
and
when
we
had
found
a
sure
bay
for
the
cable
had
a
tremendous
lively
scramble
back
to
the
boat
these
are
the
bits
of
our
life
which
i
enjoy
which
have
some
poetry
some
grandeur
in
them
may
we
ran
round
to
the
new
harbour
of
alexandria
landed
the
shore
end
of
the
cable
close
to
cleopatra
bath
and
made
a
very
satisfactory
start
about
one
in
the
afternoon
we
had
scarcely
gone
yards
when
i
noticed
that
the
cable
ceased
to
run
out
and
i
wondered
why
the
ship
had
stopped
the
elba
had
run
her
nose
on
a
sandbank
after
trying
to
force
her
over
it
an
anchor
was
put
out
astern
and
the
rope
wound
by
a
steam
winch
while
the
engines
were
backed
but
all
in
vain
at
length
a
small
turkish
steamer
the
consort
of
the
elba
came
to
her
assistance
and
by
means
of
a
hawser
helped
to
tug
her
off
the
pilot
again
ran
her
aground
soon
after
but
she
was
delivered
by
the
same
means
without
much
damage
when
of
this
cable
was
laid
the
line
snapped
in
deep
water
and
had
to
be
recovered
on
saturday
june
they
arrived
at
syra
where
they
had
to
perform
four
days
quarantine
during
which
however
they
started
repairing
the
canea
cable
bad
weather
coming
on
they
took
shelter
in
siphano
of
which
jenkin
writes
isles
of
greece
are
sad
interesting
places
they
are
not
really
barren
all
over
but
they
are
quite
destitute
of
verdure
and
tufts
of
thyme
wild
mastic
or
mint
though
they
sound
well
are
not
nearly
so
pretty
as
grass
many
little
churches
glittering
white
dot
the
islands
most
of
them
i
believe
abandoned
during
the
whole
year
with
the
exception
of
one
day
sacred
to
their
patron
saint
the
villages
are
mean
but
the
inhabitants
do
not
look
wretched
and
the
men
are
capital
sailors
there
is
something
in
this
greek
race
yet
they
will
become
a
powerful
levantine
nation
in
the
course
of
time
in
jenkin
left
the
service
of
newall
and
entered
into
partnership
with
forde
who
had
acted
as
engineer
under
the
british
government
for
the
cable
and
was
now
practising
as
a
civil
engineer
for
several
years
after
this
business
was
bad
and
with
a
young
family
coming
it
was
an
anxious
time
for
him
but
he
seems
to
have
borne
his
troubles
lightly
stevenson
says
it
was
his
principle
enjoy
each
day
happiness
as
it
arises
like
birds
and
children
in
his
first
son
was
born
and
the
family
removed
to
a
cottage
at
claygate
near
esher
though
ill
and
poor
at
this
period
he
kept
up
his
country
he
wrote
to
his
wife
give
us
please
god
health
and
strength
i
will
love
and
cherish
you
more
than
ever
you
shall
go
where
you
wish
you
shall
receive
whom
you
wish
and
as
for
money
you
shall
have
that
too
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
have
now
measured
myself
with
many
men
i
do
not
feel
weak
i
do
not
feel
that
i
shall
fail
in
many
things
i
have
succeeded
and
i
will
in
this
and
meanwhile
the
time
of
waiting
which
please
heaven
shall
not
be
so
long
shall
also
not
be
so
bitter
well
well
i
promise
much
and
do
not
know
at
this
moment
how
you
and
the
dear
child
are
if
he
is
but
better
courage
my
girl
for
i
see
light
he
took
to
gardening
without
a
natural
liking
for
it
and
soon
became
an
ardent
expert
he
wrote
reviews
and
lectured
or
amused
himself
in
playing
charades
and
reading
poetry
clerk
maxwell
and
ricketts
who
was
lost
in
the
la
plata
were
among
his
visitors
during
october
he
superintended
the
repairs
of
the
cable
revisiting
chia
and
cagliari
then
full
of
garibaldi
troops
the
cable
which
had
been
broken
by
the
anchors
of
coral
fishers
was
grapnelled
with
difficulty
rocks
we
did
hook
writes
jenkin
sooner
was
the
grapnel
down
than
the
ship
was
anchored
and
then
came
such
a
business

going

thundering
belt
slipping

of
breaking

actually
breaking
grapnels
it
was
always
an
hour
or
more
before
we
could
get
the
grapnels
down
again
in
on
the
birth
of
his
second
son
jenkin
was
very
ill
and
jenkin
after
running
two
miles
for
a
doctor
knelt
by
her
bedside
during
the
night
in
a
draught
not
wishing
to
withdraw
his
hand
from
hers
never
robust
he
suffered
much
from
flying
rheumatism
and
sciatica
ever
afterwards
it
nearly
disabled
him
while
laying
the
lowestoft
to
norderney
cable
for
reuter
in
this
line
was
designed
by
forde
jenkin
manufactured
by
henley
and
laid
by
the
caroline
and
william
cory
miss
clara
volkman
a
niece
of
reuter
sent
the
first
message
f
varley
holding
her
hand
in
jenkin
was
appointed
to
the
professorship
of
engineering
in
university
college
london
two
years
later
his
prospects
suddenly
improved
the
partnership
began
to
pay
and
he
was
selected
to
fill
the
chair
of
engineering
which
had
been
newly
established
in
edinburgh
university
what
he
thought
of
the
change
may
be
gathered
from
a
letter
to
his
wife
you
in
the
garden
at
claygate
with
austin
in
the
with
pretty
songs
in
the
little
low
white
room
with
the
moonlight
in
the
dear
room
upstairs
ah
it
was
perfect
but
the
long
walk
wondering
pondering
fearing
scheming
and
the
dusty
jolting
railway
and
the
horrid
fusty
office
with
its
endless
disappointments
they
are
well
gone
it
is
well
enough
to
fight
and
scheme
and
bustle
about
in
the
eager
crowd
here
in
london
for
awhile
now
and
then
but
not
for
a
lifetime
what
i
have
now
is
just
perfect
study
for
winter
action
for
summer
lovely
country
for
recreation
a
pleasant
town
for
talk
the
liberality
of
the
scotch
universities
allowed
him
to
continue
his
private
enterprises
and
the
summer
holiday
was
long
enough
to
make
a
trip
round
the
globe
the
following
june
he
was
on
board
the
great
eastern
while
she
laid
the
french
atlantic
cable
from
brest
to
pierre
among
his
shipmates
were
sir
william
thomson
sir
james
anderson
varley
latimer
clark
and
willoughby
smith
jenkin
sketches
of
clark
and
varley
are
particularly
happy
at
pierre
where
they
arrived
in
a
fog
which
lifted
to
show
their
consort
the
william
cory
straight
ahead
and
the
gulnare
signalling
a
welcome
jenkin
made
the
curious
observation
that
the
whole
island
was
electrified
by
the
battery
at
the
telegraph
station
jenkin
position
at
edinburgh
led
to
a
partnership
in
cable
work
with
sir
william
thomson
for
whom
he
always
had
a
love
and
admiration
jenkin
clear
practical
and
abilities
were
doubtless
an
advantage
to
sir
william
relieving
him
of
routine
and
sparing
his
great
abilities
for
higher
work
in
the
siphon
recorder
for
tracing
a
cablegram
in
ink
instead
of
merely
flashing
it
by
the
moving
ray
of
the
mirror
galvanometer
was
introduced
on
long
cables
and
became
a
source
of
profit
to
jenkin
and
varley
as
well
as
to
sir
william
its
inventor
in
thomson
and
jenkin
were
engineers
for
the
western
and
brazilian
cable
it
was
manufactured
by
hooper
of
millwall
and
the
wire
was
coated
with
then
a
new
insulator
the
hooper
left
plymouth
in
june
and
after
touching
at
madeira
where
sir
william
was
up
with
his
special
toy
the
pianoforte
wire
three
in
the
morning
they
reached
pernambuco
by
the
beginning
of
august
and
laid
a
cable
to
para
during
the
next
two
years
the
brazilian
system
was
connected
to
the
west
indies
and
the
river
plate
but
jenkin
was
not
present
on
the
expeditions
while
engaged
in
this
work
the
la
plata
bound
with
cable
from
siemens
brothers
to
monte
video
perished
in
a
cyclone
off
cape
ushant
with
the
loss
of
nearly
all
her
crew
the
atlantic
cables
were
also
laid
under
their
charge
as
a
professor
jenkin
appearance
was
against
him
but
he
was
a
clear
fluent
speaker
and
a
successful
teacher
of
medium
height
and
very
plain
his
manner
was
youthful
and
alert
but
unimposing
nevertheless
his
class
was
always
in
good
order
for
his
eye
instantly
lighted
on
any
unruly
member
and
his
reproof
was
keen
his
experimental
work
was
not
strikingly
original
at
birkenhead
he
made
some
accurate
measurements
of
the
electrical
properties
of
materials
used
in
submarine
cables
sir
william
thomson
says
he
was
the
first
to
apply
the
absolute
methods
of
measurement
introduced
by
gauss
and
weber
he
also
investigated
there
the
laws
of
electric
signals
in
submarine
cables
as
secretary
to
the
british
association
committee
on
electrical
standards
he
played
a
leading
part
in
providing
electricians
with
practical
standards
of
measurement
his
cantor
lectures
on
submarine
cables
and
his
treatise
on
electricity
and
magnetism
published
in
were
notable
works
at
the
time
and
contained
the
latest
development
of
their
subjects
he
was
associated
with
sir
william
thomson
in
an
ingenious
for
sending
signals
automatically
through
a
long
cable
but
although
tried
it
was
not
adopted
his
most
important
invention
was
telpherage
a
means
of
transporting
goods
and
passengers
to
a
distance
by
electric
panniers
supported
on
a
wire
or
conductor
which
supplied
them
with
electricity
it
was
first
patented
in
and
jenkin
spent
his
last
years
on
this
work
expecting
great
results
from
it
but
ere
the
first
public
line
was
opened
for
traffic
at
glynde
in
sussex
he
was
dead
in
mechanical
engineering
his
graphical
methods
of
calculating
strains
in
bridges
and
determining
the
efficiency
of
mechanism
are
of
much
value
the
latter
which
is
based
on
reulaux
prior
work
procured
him
the
honour
of
the
keith
gold
medal
from
the
royal
society
of
edinburgh
another
successful
work
of
his
was
the
founding
of
the
sanitary
protection
association
for
the
supervision
of
houses
with
regard
to
health
in
his
leisure
hours
jenkin
wrote
papers
on
a
wide
variety

in

him
for

reports
of
this
new
invention
and
lectured
on
it
at
a

in
edinburgh
then
employed
it
to
study
the
nature
of

consonantal
sounds
an
interesting
paper
on
rhythm
in
english
verse
was
also
published
by
him
in
the
saturday
review
for
he
was
clever
with
his
pencil
and
could
seize
a
likeness
with
astonishing
rapidity
he
has
been
known
while
on
a
cable
expedition
to
stop
a
peasant
woman
in
a
shop
for
a
few
minutes
and
sketch
her
on
the
spot
his
artistic
side
also
shows
itself
in
a
paper
on
and
critic
in
which
he
defines
the
difference
between
the
mechanical
and
fine
arts
mechanical
arts
he
says
craftsman
uses
his
skill
to
produce
something
useful
but
except
in
the
rare
case
when
he
is
at
liberty
to
choose
what
he
shall
produce
his
sole
merit
lies
in
skill
in
the
fine
arts
the
student
uses
skill
to
produce
something
beautiful
he
is
free
to
choose
what
that
something
shall
be
and
the
layman
claims
that
he
may
and
must
judge
the
artist
chiefly
by
the
value
in
beauty
of
the
thing
done
artistic
skill
contributes
to
beauty
or
it
would
not
be
skill
but
beauty
is
the
result
of

takes
among

a
clear
and
thinker
jenkin
was
an
equally
clear
and
graphic
writer
he
read
the
best
literature
preferring
among
other
things
the
story
of
david
the
odyssey
the
arcadia
the
saga
of
burnt
njal
and
the
grand
cyrus
aeschylus
sophocles
shakespeare
ariosto
boccaccio
scott
dumas
dickens
thackeray
and
george
eliot
were
some
of
his
favourite
authors
he
once
began
a
review
of
george
biography
but
left
it
unfinished
latterly
he
had
ceased
to
admire
her
work
as
much
as
before
he
was
a
rapid
fluent
talker
with
excited
utterance
at
times
some
of
his
sayings
were
shrewd
and
sharp
but
he
was
sometimes
aggressive
admire
what
is
pretty
in
an
ugly
thing
he
used
to
say
the
ugly
thing
a
lady
once
said
to
him
she
would
never
be
happy
again
does
that
signify
cried
jenkin
are
not
here
to
be
happy
but
to
be
good
on
a
friend
remarking
that
salvini
acting
in
othello
made
him
want
to
pray
jenkin
answered
is
prayer
though
admired
and
liked
by
his
intimates
jenkin
was
never
popular
with
associates
his
manner
was
hard
rasping
and
unsympathetic
virtues
he
possessed
says
stevenson
could
never
count
on
being
civil
he
showed
so
much
courtesy
to
his
wife
however
that
a
styrian
peasant
who
observed
it
spread
a
report
in
the
village
that
jenkin
a
great
lady
had
married
beneath
her
at
the
saville
club
in
london
he
was
known
as
the
who
dines
here
and
goes
up
to
scotland
jenkin
was
conscious
of
this
churlishness
and
latterly
improved
my
life
he
wrote
have
talked
a
good
deal
with
the
almost
unfailing
result
of
making
people
sick
of
the
sound
of
my
tongue
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
had
various
things
to
say
and
i
had
no
malevolent
feelings
but
nevertheless
the
result
was
that
expressed
above
well
lately
some
change
has
happened
if
i
talk
to
a
person
one
day
they
must
have
me
the
next
faces
light
up
when
they
see
me
ah
i
say
come
here
come
and
dine
with
me
it
the
most
preposterous
thing
i
ever
experienced
it
is
curiously
pleasant
jenkin
was
a
good
father
joining
in
his
children
play
as
well
as
directing
their
studies
the
boys
used
to
wait
outside
his
office
for
him
at
the
close
of
business
hours
and
a
story
is
told
of
little
frewen
the
second
son
entering
in
to
him
one
day
while
he
was
at
work
and
holding
out
a
toy
crane
he
was
making
with
the
request
you
might
finiss
windin
this
for
me
i
so
very
busy
he
was
fond
of
animals
too
and
his
dog
plate
regularly
accompanied
him
to
the
university
but
as
he
used
to
say
a
cold
home
where
a
dog
is
the
only
representative
of
a
child
in
summer
his
holidays
were
usually
spent
in
the
highlands
where
jenkin
learned
to
love
the
highland
character
and
ways
of
life
he
was
a
good
shot
rode
and
swam
well
and
taught
his
boys
athletic
exercises
boating
salmon
fishing
and
such
like
he
learned
to
dance
a
highland
reel
and
began
the
study
of
gaelic
but
that
speech
proved
too
stubborn
craggy
and
impregnable
even
for
jenkin
once
he
took
his
family
to
alt
aussee
in
the
stiermark
styria
where
he
hunted
chamois
won
a
prize
for
shooting
at
the
learned
the
dialect
of
the
country
sketched
the
neighbourhood
and
danced
the
steierisch
and
landler
with
the
peasants
he
never
seemed
to
be
happy
unless
he
was
doing
and
what
he
did
was
well
done
above
all
he
was
and
practical
mastering
many
things
no
dreamer
but
an
active
business
man
had
he
confined
himself
to
engineering
he
might
have
adorned
his
profession
more
for
he
liked
and
fitted
it
but
with
his
impulses
on
other
lines
repressed
he
might
have
been
less
happy
moreover
he
was
one
who
believed
with
the
sage
that
all
good
work
is
profitable
having
its
value
if
only
in
exercise
and
skill
his
own
parents
and
those
of
his
wife
had
come
to
live
in
edinburgh
but
he
lost
them
all
within
ten
months
of
each
other
jenkin
had
showed
great
devotion
to
them
in
their
illnesses
and
was
worn
out
with
grief
and
watching
his
telpherage
too
had
given
him
considerable
anxiety
to
perfect
and
his
mother
illness
which
affected
her
mind
had
caused
himself
to
fear
he
was
meditating
a
holiday
to
italy
with
his
wife
in
order
to
recuperate
and
had
a
trifling
operation
performed
on
his
foot
which
resulted
it
is
believed
in
blood
poisoning
there
seemed
to
be
no
danger
and
his
wife
was
reading
aloud
to
him
as
he
lay
in
bed
when
his
intellect
began
to
wander
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
regained
his
senses
before
he
died
on
june
at
one
period
of
his
life
jenkin
was
a
freethinker
holding
as
stevenson
says
all
dogmas
as
blind
struggles
to
express
the
inexpressible
nevertheless
as
time
went
on
he
came
back
to
a
belief
in
christianity
longer
i
live
he
wrote
more
convinced
i
become
of
a
direct
care
by
god
which
is
reasonably
impossible
but
there
it
is
in
his
last
year
he

johann
philipp
reis
johann
philipp
reis
the
first
inventor
of
an
electric
telephone
was
born
on
january
at
the
little
town
of
gelnhausen
in
cassel
where
his
father
was
a
master
baker
and
petty
farmer
the
boy
lost
his
mother
during
his
infancy
and
was
brought
up
by
his
paternal
grandmother
a
intelligent
woman
of
a
religious
turn
while
his
father
taught
him
to
observe
the
material
world
his
grandmother
opened
his
mind
to
the
unseen
at
the
age
of
six
he
was
sent
to
the
common
school
of
the
town
where
his
talents
attracted
the
notice
of
his
instructors
who
advised
his
father
to
extend
his
education
at
a
higher
college
reis
died
before
his
son
was
ten
years
old
but
his
grandmother
and
guardians
afterwards
placed
him
at
garnier
institute
in
friedrichsdorf
where
he
showed
a
taste
for
languages
and
acquired
both
french
and
english
as
well
as
a
stock
of
miscellaneous
information
from
the
library
at
the
end
of
his
fourteenth
year
he
passed
to
hassel
institute
at
where
he
picked
up
latin
and
italian
a
love
of
science
now
began
to
show
itself
and
his
guardians
were
recommended
to
send
him
to
the
polytechnic
school
of
carlsruhe
but
one
of
them
his
uncle
wished
him
to
become
a
merchant
and
on
march
reis
was
apprenticed
to
the
colour
trade
in
the
establishment
of
f
beyerbach
of
frankfort
against
his
own
will
he
told
his
uncle
that
he
would
learn
the
business
chosen
for
him
but
should
continue
his
proper
studies
by
diligent
service
he
won
the
esteem
of
beyerbach
and
devoted
his
leisure
to
taking
private
lessons
in
mathematics
and
physics
and
attending
the
lectures
of
professor
bottger
on
mechanics
at
the
trade
school
when
his
apprenticeship
ended
he
attended
the
institute
of
poppe
in
frankfort
and
as
neither
history
nor
geography
was
taught
there
several
of
the
students
agreed
to
instruct
each
other
in
these
subjects
reis
undertook
geography
and
believed
he
had
found
his
true
vocation
in
the
art
of
teaching
he
also
became
a
member
of
the
physical
society
of
frankfort
in
he
completed
his
year
of
military
service
at
cassel
then
returned
to
frankfort
to
qualify
himself
as
a
teacher
of
mathematics
and
science
in
the
schools
by
means
of
private
study
and
public
lectures
his
intention
was
to
finish
his
training
at
the
university
of
heidelberg
but
in
the
spring
of
he
visited
his
old
friend
and
master
hofrath
garnier
who
offered
him
a
post
in
garnier
institute
in
the
autumn
of
he
removed
to
friedrichsdorf
to
begin
his
new
career
and
in
september
following
he
took
a
wife
and
settled
down
reis
imagined
that
electricity
could
be
propagated
through
space
as
light
can
without
the
aid
of
a
material
conductor
and
he
made
some
experiments
on
the
subject
the
results
were
described
in
a
paper
the
radiation
of
electricity
which
in
he
posted
to
professor
poggendorff
for
insertion
in
the
periodical
the
annalen
der
physik
the
memoir
was
declined
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
sensitive
young
teacher
reis
had
studied
the
organs
of
hearing
and
the
idea
of
an
apparatus
for
transmitting
sound
by
means
of
electricity
had
been
floating
in
his
mind
for
years
incited
by
his
lessons
on
physics
in
the
year
he
attacked
the
problem
and
was
rewarded
with
success
in
he
again
tried
poggendorff
with
an
account
of
his
as
he
called
it
the
word
occurs
in
timbs
repository
of
science
and
art
for
in
connection
with
a
signal
trumpet
operated
by
compressed
air
but
his
second
offering
was
rejected
like
the
first
the
learned
professor
it
seems
regarded
the
transmission
of
speech
by
electricity
as
a
chimera
but
reis
in
the
bitterness
of
wounded
feeling
attributed
the
failure
to
his
being
a
poor
schoolmaster
since
the
invention
of
the
telephone
attention
has
been
called
to
the
fact
that
in
charles
bourseul
a
french
telegraphist
happily
still
alive
had
conceived
a
plan
for
conveying
sounds
and
even
speech
by
electricity
he
explained
a
man
speaks
near
a
movable
disc
sufficiently
flexible
to
lose
none
of
the
vibrations
of
the
voice
that
this
disc
alternately
makes
and
breaks
the
currents
from
a
battery
you
may
have
at
a
distance
another
disc
which
will
simultaneously
execute
the
same
vibrations
it
is
certain
that
in
a
more
or
less
distant
future
speech
will
be
transmitted
by
electricity
i
have
made
experiments
in
this
direction
they
are
delicate
and
demand
time
and
patience
but
the
approximations
obtained
promise
a
favourable
result
see
du
moncel
expose
des
applications
etc
bourseul
deserves
the
credit
of
being
perhaps
the
first
to
devise
an
electric
telephone
and
try
to
make
it
but
to
reis
belongs
the
honour
of
first
realising
the
idea
a
writer
may
plot
a
story
or
a
painter
invent
a
theme
for
a
picture
but
unless
he
execute
the
work
of
what
benefit
is
it
to
the
world
true
a
suggestion
in
mechanics
may
stimulate
another
to
apply
it
in
practice
and
in
that
case
the
suggester
is
entitled
to
some
share
of
the
credit
as
well
as
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
to
think
of
the
matter
but
it
is
best
when
the
original
deviser
also
carries
out
the
work
and
if
another
should
independently
hit
upon
the
same
idea
and
bring
it
into
practice
we
are
bound
to
honour
him
in
full
though
we
may
also
recognise
the
merit
of
his
predecessor
bourseul
idea
seems
to
have
attracted
little
notice
at
the
time
and
was
soon
forgotten
even
the
count
du
moncel
who
was
ever
ready
to
welcome
a
promising
invention
evidently
regarded
it
as
a
fantastic
notion
it
is
very
doubtful
if
reis
had
ever
heard
of
it
he
was
led
to
conceive
a
similar
apparatus
by
a
study
of
the
mechanism
of
the
human
ear
which
he
knew
to
contain
a
membrane
or
vibrating
under
the
waves
of
sound
and
communicating
its
vibrations
through
the
behind
it
to
the
auditory
nerve
it
therefore
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
made
a
diaphragm
in
imitation
of
the
drum
and
caused
it
by
vibrating
to
make
and
break
the
circuit
of
an
electric
current
he
would
be
able
through
the
magnetic
power
of
the
interrupted
current
to
reproduce
the
original
sounds
at
a
distance
in
professor
page
of
massachusetts
had
discovered
that
a
needle
or
thin
bar
of
iron
placed
in
the
hollow
of
a
coil
or
bobbin
of
insulated
wire
would
emit
an
audible
at
each
interruption
of
a
current
flowing
in
the
coil
and
that
if
these
separate
ticks
followed
each
other
fast
enough
by
a
rapid
interruption
of
the
current
they
would
run
together
into
a
continuous
hum
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
music
the
pitch
of
this
note
would
correspond
to
the
rate
of
interruption
of
the
current
from
these
and
other
discoveries
which
had
been
made
by
noad
wertheim
marrian
and
others
reis
knew
that
if
the
current
which
had
been
interrupted
by
his
vibrating
diaphragm
were
conveyed
to
a
distance
by
a
metallic
circuit
and
there
passed
through
a
coil
like
that
of
page
the
iron
needle
would
emit
a
note
like
that
which
had
caused
the
oscillation
of
the
transmitting
diaphragm
acting
on
this
knowledge
he
constructed
a
rude
telephone
messel
informs
us
that
his
first
transmitter
consisted
of
the
bung
of
a
beer
barrel
hollowed
out
in
imitation
of
the
external
ear
the
cup
or
thus
formed
was
closed
by
the
skin
of
a
german
sausage
to
serve
as
a
drum
or
diaphragm
to
the
back
of
this
he
fixed
with
a
drop
of
a
little
strip
of
platinum
representing
the
which
made
and
broke
the
metallic
circuit
of
the
current
as
the
membrane
oscillated
under
the
sounds
which
impinged
against
it
the
current
thus
interrupted
was
conveyed
by
wires
to
the
receiver
which
consisted
of
a
loosely
surrounded
by
a
coil
of
wire
fastened
to
the
breast
of
a
violin
as
a
when
a
musical
note
was
struck
near
the
bung
the
drum
vibrated
in
harmony
with
the
pitch
of
the
note
the
platinum
lever
interrupted
the
metallic
circuit
of
the
current
which
after
traversing
the
conducting
wire
passed
through
the
coil
of
the
receiver
and
made
the
needle
hum
the
original
tone
this
primitive
arrangement
we
are
told
astonished
all
who
heard
it
it
is
now
in
the
museum
of
the
reichs
berlin
another
of
his
early
transmitters
was
a
rough
model
of
the
human
ear
carved
in
oak
and
provided
with
a
drum
which
actuated
a
bent
and
pivoted
lever
of
platinum
making
it
open
and
close
a
springy
contact
of
platinum
foil
in
the
metallic
circuit
of
the
current
he
devised
some
ten
or
twelve
different
forms
each
an
improvement
on
its
predecessors
which
transmitted
music
fairly
well
and
even
a
word
or
two
of
speech
with
more
or
less
perfection
but
the
apparatus
failed
as
a
practical
means
of
talking
to
a
distance
the
discovery
of
the
microphone
by
professor
hughes
has
enabled
us
to
understand
the
reason
of
this
failure
the
transmitter
of
reis
was
based
on
the
plan
of
interrupting
the
current
and
the
spring
was
intended
to
close
the
contact
after
it
had
been
opened
by
the
shock
of
a
vibration
so
long
as
the
sound
was
a
musical
tone
it
proved
efficient
for
a
musical
tone
is
a
regular
succession
of
vibrations
but
the
vibrations
of
speech
are
irregular
and
complicated
and
in
order
to
transmit
them
the
current
has
to
be
varied
in
strength
without
being
altogether
broken
the
waves
excited
in
the
air
by
the
voice
should
merely
produce
corresponding
waves
in
the
current
in
short
the
current
ought
to
undulate
in
sympathy
with
the
oscillations
of
the
air
it
appears
from
the
report
of
herr
von
legat
inspector
of
the
royal
prussian
telegraphs
on
the
reis
telephone
published
in
that
the
inventor
was
quite
aware
of
this
principle
but
his
instrument
was
not
well
adapted
to
apply
it
no
doubt
the
platinum
contacts
he
employed
in
the
transmitter
behaved
to
some
extent
as
a
crude
metal
microphone
and
hence
a
few
words
especially
familiar
or
expected
ones
could
be
transmitted
and
distinguished
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
but
reis
does
not
seem
to
have
realised
the
importance
of
not
entirely
breaking
the
circuit
of
the
current
at
all
events
his
metal
spring
is
not
in
practice
an
effective
provision
against
this
for
it
allows
the
metal
contacts
to
jolt
too
far
apart
and
thus
interrupt
the
current
had
he
lived
to
modify
the
spring
and
the
form
or
material
of
his
contacts
so
as
to
keep
the
current
continuous
as
he
might
have
done
for
example
by
using
carbon
for
platinum
he
would
have
forestalled
alike
bell
edison
and
hughes
in
the
production
of
a
good
speaking
telephone
reis
in
fact
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
a
great
discovery
which
was
however
reserved
for
others
his
experiments
were
made
in
a
little
workshop
behind
his
home
at
friedrichsdorff
and
wires
were
run
from
it
to
an
upper
chamber
another
line
was
erected
between
the
physical
cabinet
at
garnier
institute
across
the
playground
to
one
of
the
and
there
was
a
tradition
in
the
school
that
the
boys
were
afraid
of
creating
an
uproar
in
the
room
for
fear
herr
reis
should
hear
them
with
his
the
new
invention
was
published
to
the
world
in
a
lecture
before
the
physical
society
of
frankfort
on
october
and
a
description
written
by
himself
for
the
jahresbericht
a
month
or
two
later
it
excited
a
good
deal
of
scientific
notice
in
germany
models
of
it
were
sent
abroad
to
london
dublin
tiflis
and
other
places
it
became
a
subject
for
popular
lectures
and
an
article
for
scientific
cabinets
reis
obtained
a
brief
renown
but
the
reaction
soon
set
in
the
physical
society
of
frankfort
turned
its
back
on
the
apparatus
which
had
given
it
lustre
reis
resigned
his
membership
in
but
the
free
german
institute
of
frankfort
which
elected
him
an
honorary
member
also
slighted
the
instrument
as
a
mere
toy
at
first
it
was
a
dream
and
now
it
is
a
plaything
have
we
not
had
enough
of
that
superior
wisdom
which
is
another
name
for
stupidity
the
dreams
of
the
imagination
are
apt
to
become
realities
and
the
toy
of
has
a
knack
of
growing
into
the
mighty
engine
of
reis
believed
in
his
invention
if
no
one
else
did
and
had
he
been
encouraged
by
his
fellows
from
the
beginning
he
might
have
brought
it
into
a
practical
shape
but
rebuffs
had
preyed
upon
his
sensitive
heart
and
he
was
already
stricken
with
consumption
it
is
related
that
after
his
lecture
on
the
telephone
at
geissen
in
professor
poggendorff
who
was
present
invited
him
to
send
a
description
of
his
instrument
to
the
annalen
reis
answered
him
danke

you
very
much

it
is
too
late
i
shall
not

now
my

become
known
without
any
writing
in
the
annalen
latterly
reis
had
confined
his
teaching
and
study
to
matters
of
science
but
his
bad
health
was
a
serious
impediment
for
several
years
it
was
only
by
the
exercise
of
a
strong
will
that
he
was
able
to
carry
on
his
duties
his
voice
began
to
fail
as
the
disease
gained
upon
his
lungs
and
in
the
summer
of
he
was
obliged
to
forsake
tuition
during
several
weeks
the
autumn
vacation
strengthened
his
hopes
of
recovery
and
he
resumed
his
teaching
with
his
wonted
energy
but
this
was
the
last
flicker
of
the
expiring
flame
it
was
announced
that
he
would
show
his
new
at
a
meeting
of
the
deutscher
naturforscher
of
wiesbaden
in
september
but
he
was
too
ill
to
appear
in
december
he
lay
down
and
after
a
long
and
painful
illness
breathed
his
last
at
five
in
the
afternoon
of
january
in
his
curriculum
vitae
he
wrote
these
words
i
look
back
upon
my
life
i
call
indeed
say
with
the
holy
scriptures
that
it
has
been
labour
and
sorrow
but
i
have
also
to
thank
the
lord
that
he
has
given
me
his
blessing
in
my
calling
and
in
my
family
and
has
bestowed
more
good
upon
me
than
i
have
known
how
to
ask
of
him
the
lord
has
helped
hitherto
he
will
help
yet
further

in
after
the
introduction
of

graham
bell
the
first
to
produce
a
practicable
speaking
telephone
was
alexander
graham
bell
he
was
born
at
edinburgh
on
march
and
comes
of
a
family
associated
with
the
teaching
of
elocution
his
grandfather
in
london
his
uncle
in
dublin
and
his
father
andrew
melville
bell
in
edinburgh
were
all
professed
elocutionists
the
latter
has
published
a
variety
of
works
on
the
subject
several
of
which
are
well
known
especially
his
treatise
on
visible
speech
which
appeared
in
edinburgh
in
in
this
he
explains
his
ingenious
method
of
instructing
deaf
mutes
by
means
of
their
eyesight
how
to
articulate
words
and
also
how
to
read
what
other
persons
are
saying
by
the
motions
of
their
lips
graham
bell
his
distinguished
son
was
educated
at
the
high
school
of
edinburgh
and
subsequently
at
warzburg
in
germany
where
he
obtained
the
degree
of
doctor
of
philosophy
while
still
in
scotland
he
is
said
to
have
turned
his
attention
to
the
science
of
acoustics
with
a
view
to
ameliorate
the
deafness
of
his
mother
in
he
accompanied
his
father
to
montreal
in
canada
where
he
was
employed
in
teaching
the
system
of
visible
speech
the
elder
bell
was
invited
to
introduce
it
into
a
large
for
mutes
at
boston
but
he
declined
the
post
in
favour
of
his
son
who
soon
became
famous
in
the
united
states
for
his
success
in
this
important
work
he
published
more
than
one
treatise
on
the
subject
at
washington
and
it
is
we
believe
mainly
through
his
efforts
that
thousands
of
deaf
mutes
in
america
are
now
able
to
speak
almost
if
not
quite
as
well
as
those
who
are
able
to
hear
before
he
left
scotland
graham
bell
had
turned
his
attention
to
telephony
and
in
canada
he
designed
a
piano
which
could
transmit
its
music
to
a
distance
by
means
of
electricity
at
boston
he
continued
his
researches
in
the
same
field
and
endeavoured
to
produce
a
telephone
which
would
not
only
send
musical
notes
but
articulate
speech
if
it
be
interesting
to
trace
the
evolution
of
an
animal
from
its
rudimentary
germ
through
the
lower
phases
to
the
perfect
organism
it
is
almost
as
interesting
to
follow
an
invention
from
the
original
model
through
the
faultier
types
to
the
finished
apparatus
in
philipp
reis
as
we
have
seen
produced
a
telephone
which
could
transmit
musical
notes
and
even
a
lisping
word
or
two
and
some
ten
years
later
cromwell
fleetwood
varley
a
english
electrician
patented
a
number
of
ingenious
devices
for
applying
the
musical
telephone
to
transmit
messages
by
dividing
the
notes
into
short
or
long
signals
after
the
morse
code
which
could
be
interpreted
by
the
ear
or
by
the
eye
in
causing
them
to
mark
a
moving
paper
these
inventions
were
not
put
in
practice
but
four
years
afterwards
herr
paul
la
cour
a
danish
inventor
experimented
with
a
similar
appliance
on
a
line
of
telegraph
between
copenhagen
and
fredericia
in
jutland
in
this
a
vibrating
interrupted
the
current
which
after
traversing
the
line
passed
through
an
and
attracted
the
limbs
of
another
fork
making
it
strike
a
note
like
the
transmitting
fork
by
breaking
up
the
note
at
the
sending
station
with
a
signalling
key
the
message
was
heard
as
a
series
of
long
and
short
hums
moreover
the
hums
were
made
to
record
themselves
on
paper
by
turning
the
receiver
into
a
relay
which
actuated
a
morse
printer
by
means
of
a
local
battery
elisha
gray
of
chicago
also
devised
a
tone
telegraph
of
this
kind
about
the
same
time
as
herr
la
cour
in
this
apparatus
a
vibrating
steel
tongue
interrupted
the
current
which
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
passed
through
the
and
vibrated
a
band
or
tongue
of
iron
near
its
poles
gray
telegraph
with
the
vibrating
tongues
or
reeds
was
afterwards
introduced
on
the
lines
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
in
america
as
more
than
one
set
of
vibrations
that
is
to
say
more
than
one
note
can
be
sent
over
the
same
wire
simultaneously
it
is
utilised
as
a
or
telegraph
conveying
several
messages
through
the
same
wire
at
once
and
these
can
either
be
interpreted
by
the
sound
or
the
marks
drawn
on
a
ribbon
of
travelling
paper
by
a
morse
recorder
gray
also
invented
a
receiver
which
has
a
curious
history
early
in
his
nephew
was
playing
with
a
small
induction
coil
and
having
connected
one
end
of
the
secondary
circuit
to
the
zinc
lining
of
a
bath
which
was
dry
he
was
holding
the
other
end
in
his
left
hand
while
he
rubbed
the
zinc
with
his
right
hand
gray
noticed
that
a
sound
proceeded
from
it
which
had
the
pitch
and
quality
of
the
note
emitted
by
the
vibrating
contact
or
electrotome
of
the
coil
immediately
took
the
electrode
in
my
hand
he
writes
repeating
the
operation
found
to
my
astonishment
that
by
rubbing
hard
and
rapidly
i
could
make
a
much
louder
sound
than
the
electrotome
i
then
changed
the
pitch
of
the
vibration
and
found
that
the
pitch
of
the
sound
under
my
hand
was
also
changed
agreeing
with
that
of
the
vibration
gray
lost
no
time
in
applying
this
chance
discovery
by
designing
the
physiological
receiver
which
consists
of
a
having
a
zinc
face
and
mounted
on
an
axle
so
that
it
can
be
revolved
by
a
handle
one
wire
of
the
circuit
is
connected
to
the
revolving
zinc
and
the
other
wire
is
connected
to
the
finger
which
rubs
on
the
zinc
the
sounds
are
quite
distinct
and
would
seem
to
be
produced
by
a
microphonic
action
between
the
skin
and
the
metal
all
these
apparatus
follow
in
the
track
of
reis
and
bourseul
that
is
to
say
the
interruption
of
the
current
by
a
vibrating
contact
it
was
fortunate
for
bell
that
in
working
with
his
musical
telephone
an
accident
drove
him
into
a
new
path
which
ultimately
brought
him
to
the
invention
of
a
speaking
telephone
he
began
his
researches
in
with
a
musical
telephone
in
which
he
employed
the
interrupted
current
to
vibrate
the
receiver
which
consisted
of
an
causing
an
iron
reed
or
tongue
to
vibrate
but
while
trying
it
one
day
with
his
assistant
thomas
watson
it
was
found
that
a
reed
failed
to
respond
to
the
intermittent
current
bell
desired
his
assistant
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
to
pluck
the
reed
thinking
it
had
stuck
to
the
pole
of
the
magnet
watson
complied
and
to
his
astonishment
bell
observed
that
the
corresponding
reed
at
his
end
of
the
line
thereupon
began
to
vibrate
and
emit
the
same
note
although
there
was
no
interrupted
current
to
make
it
a
few
experiments
soon
showed
that
his
reed
had
been
set
in
vibration
by
the
currents
induced
in
the
line
by
the
mere
motion
of
the
distant
reed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
its
magnet
this
discovery
led
him
to
discard
the
battery
current
altogether
and
rely
upon
the
currents
of
the
reeds
themselves
moreover
it
occurred
to
him
that
since
the
circuit
was
never
broken
all
the
complex
vibrations
of
speech
might
be
converted
into
sympathetic
currents
which
in
turn
would
reproduce
the
speech
at
a
distance
reis
had
seen
that
an
undulatory
current
was
needed
to
transmit
sounds
in
perfection
especially
vocal
sounds
but
his
mode
of
producing
the
undulations
was
defective
from
a
mechanical
and
electrical
point
of
view
by
forming
of
magnetic
disturbance
near
a
coil
of
wire
professor
bell
could
generate
corresponding
waves
of
electricity
in
the
line
so
delicate
and
continuous
that
all
the
modulations
of
sound
could
be
reproduced
at
a
distance
as
professor
of
vocal
physiology
in
the
university
of
boston
he
was
engaged
in
training
teachers
in
the
art
of
instructing
deaf
mutes
how
to
speak
and
experimented
with
the
leon
scott
phonautograph
in
recording
the
vibrations
of
speech
this
apparatus
consists
essentially
of
a
thin
membrane
vibrated
by
the
voice
and
carrying
a
light
stylus
which
traces
an
undulatory
line
on
a
plate
of
smoked
glass
the
line
is
a
graphic
representation
of
the
vibrations
of
the
membrane
and
the
waves
of
sound
in
the
air
on
the
suggestion
of
clarence
blake
an
eminent
boston
aurist
professor
bell
abandoned
the
phonautograph
for
the
human
ear
which
it
resembled
and
having
removed
the
stapes
bone
moistened
the
drum
with
glycerine
and
water
attached
a
stylus
of
hay
to
the
nicus
or
anvil
and
obtained
a
beautiful
series
of
curves
in
imitation
of
the
vocal
sounds
the
disproportion
between
the
slight
mass
of
the
drum
and
the
bones
it
actuated
is
said
to
have
suggested
to
him
the
employment
of
goldbeater
skin
as
membrane
in
his
speaking
telephone
be
this
as
it
may
he
devised
a
receiver
consisting
of
a
stretched
diaphragm
or
drum
of
this
material
having
an
armature
of
magnetised
iron
attached
to
its
middle
and
free
to
vibrate
in
front
of
the
pole
of
an
in
circuit
with
the
line
this
apparatus
was
completed
on
june
and
the
same
day
he
succeeded
in
transmitting
sounds
and
audible
signals
by
currents
and
without
the
aid
of
a
battery
on
july
he
instructed
his
assistant
to
make
a
second
which
could
be
used
with
the
first
and
a
few
days
later
they
were
tried
together
one
at
each
end
of
the
line
which
ran
from
a
room
in
the
house
at
boston
to
the
cellar
underneath
bell
in
the
room
held
one
instrument
in
his
hands
while
watson
in
the
cellar
listened
at
the
other
the
inventor
spoke
into
his
instrument
you
understand
what
i
say
and
we
can
imagine
his
delight
when
watson
rushed
into
the
room
under
the
influence
of
his
excitement
and
answered
a
finished
instrument
was
then
made
having
a
transmitter
formed
of
a
double
in
front
of
which
a
membrane
stretched
on
a
ring
carried
an
oblong
piece
of
soft
iron
cemented
to
its
middle
a
mouthpiece
before
the
diaphragm
directed
the
sounds
upon
it
and
as
it
vibrated
with
them
the
soft
iron
induced
corresponding
currents
in
the
cells
of
the
these
currents
after
traversing
the
line
were
passed
through
the
receiver
which
consisted
of
a
tubular
having
one
end
partially
closed
by
a
thin
circular
disc
of
soft
iron
fixed
at
one
point
to
the
end
of
the
tube
this
receiver
bore
a
resemblance
to
a
cylindrical
metal
box
with
thick
sides
having
a
thin
iron
lid
fastened
to
its
mouth
by
a
single
screw
when
the
undulatory
current
passed
through
the

all
this
my
own
ears
heard
spoken

me
with
unmistakable
distinctness
by
the
then
circular
disc
armature
of
just
such
another
little
as
this

hold
in
my
hand
to
hear
the
immortal
words
of
shakespeare
uttered
by
the
small
inanimate
voice
which
had
been
given
to
the
world
must
indeed
have
been
a
rare
delight
to
the
ardent
soul
of
the
great
electrician
the
surprise
created
among
the
public
at
large
by
this
unexpected
communication
will
be
readily
remembered
except
one
or
two
inventors
nobody
had
ever
dreamed
of
a
telegraph
that
could
actually
speak
any
more
than
they
had
ever
fancied
one
that
could
see
or
feel
and
imagination
grew
busy
in
picturing
the
outcome
of
it
since
it
was
practically
equivalent
to
a
limitless
extension
of
the
vocal
powers
the
ingenious
journalist
soon
conjured
up
an
infinity
of
uses
for
the
telephone
and
hailed
the
approaching
time
when
friends
would
be
able
to
whisper
to
one
another
under
the
roaring
billows
of
the
atlantic
curiosity
however
was
not
fully
satisfied
until
professor
bell
the
inventor
of
the
instrument
himself
showed
it
to
british
audiences
and
received
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
his
admiring
countrymen
the
primitive
telephone
has
been
greatly
improved
the
double
being
replaced
by
a
single
bar
magnet
having
a
small
coil
or
bobbin
of
fine
wire
surrounding
one
pole
in
front
of
which
a
thin
disc
of
ferrotype
is
fixed
in
a
circular
mouthpiece
and
serves
as
a
combined
membrane
and
armature
on
speaking
into
the
mouthpiece
the
iron
diaphragm
vibrates
with
the
voice
in
the
magnetic
field
of
the
pole
and
thereby
excites
the
undulatory
currents
in
the
coil
which
after
travelling
through
the
wire
to
the
distant
place
are
received
in
an
identical
apparatus
this
form
was
patented
january
in
traversing
the
coil
of
the
latter
they
reinforce
or
weaken
the
magnetism
of
the
pole
and
thus
make
the
disc
armature
vibrate
so
as
to
give
out
a
mimesis
of
the
original
voice
the
sounds
are
small
and
elfin
a
minim
of
speech
and
only
to
be
heard
when
the
ear
is
close
to
the
mouthpiece
but
they
are
remarkably
distinct
and
in
spite
of
a
disguising
twang
due
to
the
fundamental
note
of
the
disc
itself
it
is
easy
to
recognise
the
speaker
this
later
form
was
publicly
exhibited
on
may
at
a
lecture
given
by
professor
bell
in
the
boston
music
hall
to
the
small
telephone
box
with
its
slender
wire
attachments
says
a
report
bell
coolly
asked
as
though
addressing
some
one
in
an
adjoining
room
watson
are
you
ready
watson
five
miles
away
in
somerville
promptly
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
soon
was
heard
a
voice
singing
america
to
another
instrument
connected
by
wire
with
providence
miles
distant
bell
listened
a
moment
and
said
signor
brignolli
who
is
assisting
at
a
concert
in
providence
music
hall
will
now
sing
for
us
in
a
moment
the
cadence
of
the
tenor
voice
rose
and
fell
the
sound
being
faint
sometimes
lost
and
then
again
audible
later
a
cornet
solo
played
in
somerville
was
very
distinctly
heard
still
later
a
song
floated
over
the
wire
from
the
somerville
terminus
and
bell
amused
his
audience
exceedingly
by
exclaiming
i
will
switch
off
the
song
from
one
part
of
the
room
to
another
so
that
all
can
hear
at
a
subsequent
lecture
in
salem
massachusetts
communication
was
established
with
boston
eighteen
miles
distant
and
watson
at
the
latter
place
sang
auld
lang
syne
the
national
anthem
and
hail
columbia
while
the
audience
at
salem
joined
in
the
chorus
bell
had
overcome
the
difficulty
which
baffled
reis
and
succeeded
in
making
the
undulations
of
the
current
fit
the
vibrations
of
the
voice
as
a
glove
will
fit
the
hand
but
the
articulation
though
distinct
was
feeble
and
it
remained
for
edison
by
inventing
the
carbon
transmitter
and
hughes
by
discovering
the
microphone
to
render
the
telephone
the
useful
and
widespread
apparatus
which
we
see
it
now
bell
patented
his
speaking
telephone
in
the
united
states
at
the
beginning
of
and
by
a
strange
coincidence
elisha
gray
applied
on
the
same
day
for
another
patent
of
a
similar
kind
gray
transmitter
is
supposed
to
have
been
suggested
by
the
very
old
device
known
as
the
telephone
in
which
two
diaphragms
are
joined
by
a
taut
string
and
in
speaking
against
one
the
voice
is
conveyed
through
the
string
solely
by
mechanical
vibration
to
the
other
gray
employed
electricity
and
varied
the
strength
of
the
current
in
conformity
with
the
voice
by
causing
the
diaphragm
in
vibrating
to
dip
a
metal
probe
attached
to
its
centre
more
or
less
deep
into
a
well
of
conducting
liquid
in
circuit
with
the
line
as
the
current
passed
from
the
probe
through
the
liquid
to
the
line
a
greater
or
less
thickness
of
liquid
intervened
as
the
probe
vibrated
up
and
down
and
thus
the
strength
of
the
current
was
regulated
by
the
resistance
offered
to
the
passage
of
the
current
his
receiver
was
an
having
an
iron
plate
as
an
armature
capable
of
vibrating
under
the
attractions
of
the
varying
current
but
gray
allowed
his
idea
to
slumber
whereas
bell
continued
to
perfect
his
apparatus
however
when
bell
achieved
an
unmistakable
success
gray
brought
a
suit
against
him
which
resulted
in
a
compromise
one
public
company
acquiring
both
patents
bell
invention
has
been
contested
over
and
over
again
and
more
than
one
claimant
for
the
honour
and
reward
of
being
the
original
inventor
of
the
telephone
have
appeared
the
most
interesting
case
was
that
of
signor
antonio
meucci
an
italian
emigrant
who
produced
a
mass
of
evidence
to
show
that
in
while
in
havanna
cuba
he
experimented
with
the
view
of
transmitting
speech
by
the
electric
current
he
continued
his
researches
in
and
subsequently
at
staten
island
and
in
deputed
a
friend
visiting
europe
to
interest
people
in
his
invention
in
he
filed
a
caveat
in
the
united
states
patent
office
and
tried
to
get
grant
president
of
the
new
york
district
telegraph
company
to
give
the
apparatus
a
trial
and
poverty
consequent
on
an
injury
due
to
an
explosion
on
board
the
staten
island
ferry
boat
westfield
retarded
his
experiments
and
prevented
him
from
completing
his
patent
meucci
experimental
apparatus
was
exhibited
at
the
philadelphia
exhibition
of
and
attracted
much
attention
but
the
evidence
he
adduces
in
support
of
his
early
claims
is
that
of
persons
ignorant
of
electrical
science
and
the
model
shown
was
not
complete
the
caveat
of
is
indeed
a
reliable
document
but
unfortunately
for
him
it
is
not
quite
clear
from
it
whether
he
employed
a
telephone
with
a
wire
instead
of
a
string
and
joined
a
battery
to
it
in
the
hope
of
enhancing
the
effect
employ
he
says
well
known
conducting
effect
of
continuous
metallic
conductors
as
a
medium
for
sound
and
increase
the
effect
by
electrically
insulating
both
the
conductor
and
the
parties
who
are
communicating
it
forms
a
speaking
telegraph
without
the
necessity
of
any
hollow
tube
in
connection
with
the
telephone
he
used
an
electric
alarm
it
is
by
no
means
evident
from
this
description
that
meucci
had
devised
a
practicable
speaking
telephone
but
he
may
have
been
the
first
to
employ
electricity
in
connection
with
the
transmission
of
speech
meucci
is
dead
crowning
marvel
of
the
electric
telegraph
as
sir
william
thomson
happily
expressed
it
was
followed
by
another
invention
in
some
respects
even
more
remarkable
during
the
winter
of
professor
bell
was
in
england
and
while
lecturing
at
the
royal
institution
london
he
conceived
the
idea
of
the
photophone
it
was
known
that
crystalline
selenium
is
a
substance
peculiarly
sensitive
to
light
for
when
a
ray
strikes
it
an
electric
current
passes
far
more
easily
through
it
than
if
it
were
kept
in
the
dark
it
therefore
occurred
to
professor
bell
that
if
a
telephone
were
connected
in
circuit
with
the
current
and
the
ray
of
light
falling
on
the
selenium
was
eclipsed
by
means
of
the
vibrations
of
sound
the
current
would
undulate
in
keeping
with
the
light
and
the
telephone
would
emit
a
corresponding
note
in
this
way
it
might
be
literally
possible
hear
a
shadow
fall
athwart
the
stillness
he
was
not
the
first
to
entertain
the
idea
for
in
the
summer
of
one
writing
from
kew
on
june
to
the
scientific
journal
nature
describes
an
arrangement
of
the
kind
to
professor
bell
in
conjunction
with
summer
tainter
belongs
the
honour
of
having
by
dint
of
patient
thought
and
labour
brought
the
photophone
into
material
existence
by
constructing
sensitive
selenium
cells
through
which
the
current
passed
then
directing
a
powerful
beam
of
light
upon
them
and
occulting
it
by
a
rotary
screen
he
was
able
to
vary
the
strength
of
the
current
in
such
a
manner
as
to
elicit
musical
tones
from
the
telephone
in
circuit
with
the
cells
moreover
by
reflecting
the
beam
from
a
mirror
upon
the
cells
and
vibrating
the
mirror
by
the
action
of
the
voice
he
was
able
to
reproduce
the
spoken
words
in
the
telephone
in
both
cases
the
only
connecting
line
between
the
transmitting
screen
or
mirror
and
the
receiving
cells
and
telephone
was
the
ray
of
light
with
this
apparatus
which
reminds
us
of
the
invocation
to
apollo
in
the
martyr
of
antioch
of
the
speaking
lyre
that
with
a
touch
of
fire
music
which
delays
the
charmed
spheres
professor
bell
has
accomplished
the
curious
feat
of
speaking
along
a
beam
of
sunshine
feet
long
the
apparatus
consisted
of
a
transmitter
with
a
mouthpiece
conveying
the
sound
of
the
voice
to
a
silvered
diaphragm
or
mirror
which
reflected
the
vibratory
beam
through
a
lens
towards
the
selenium
receiver
which
was
simply
a
parabolic
reflector
in
the
focus
of
which
was
placed
the
selenium
cells
connected
in
circuit
with
a
battery
and
a
pair
of
telephones
one
for
each
ear
the
transmitter
was
placed
in
the
top
of
the
franklin
schoolhouse
at
washington
and
the
receiver
in
the
window
of
professor
laboratory
in
l
street
was
impossible
says
the
inventor
converse
by
word
of
mouth
across
that
distance
and
while
i
was
observing
tainter
on
the
top
of
the
schoolhouse
almost
blinded
by
the
light
which
was
coming
in
at
the
window
of
my
laboratory
and
vainly
trying
to
understand
the
gestures
he
was
making
to
me
at
that
great
distance
the
thought
occurred
to
me
to
listen
to
the
telephones
connected
with
the
selenium
receiver
tainter
saw
me
disappear
from
the
window
and
at
once
spoke
to
the
transmitter
i
heard
him
distinctly
say
bell
if
you
hear
what
i
say
come
to
the
window
and
wave
your
hat
it
is
needless
to
say
with
what
gusto
i
obeyed
the
spectroscope
has
demonstrated
the
truth
of
the
poet
who
said
that
is
the
voice
of
the
stars
and
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
professor
bell
and
janssen
the
celebrated
astronomer
that
the
changing
brightness
of
the
photosphere
as
produced
by
solar
hurricanes
has
produced
a
feeble
echo
in
the
photophone
pursuing
these
researches
professor
bell
discovered
that
not
only
the
selenium
cell
but
simple
discs
of
wood
glass
metal
ivory
and
so
on
yielded
a
distinct
note
when
the
intermittent
ray
of
light
fell
upon
them
crystals
of
sulphate
of
copper
chips
of
pine
and
even
in
a
held
before
the
beam
emitted
a
musical
tone
with
a
thin
disc
of
vulcanite
as
receiver
the
dark
heat
rays
which
pass
through
an
opaque
screen
were
found
to
yield
a
note
even
the
outer
ear
is
itself
a
receiver
for
when
the
intermittent
beam
is
focussed
in
the
cavity
a
faint
musical
tone
is
heard
another
research
of
professor
bell
was
that
in
which
he
undertook
to
localise
the
assassin
bullet
in
the
body
of
the
lamented
president
garfield
in
professor
hughes
brought
out
his
beautiful
induction
balance
and
the
following
year
professor
bell
who
had
already
worked
in
the
same
field
consulted
him
by
telegraph
as
to
the
best
mode
of
applying
the
balance
to
determining
the
place
of
the
bullet
which
had
hitherto
escaped
the
probes
of
the
president
physicians
professor
hughes
advised
him
by
telegraph
and
with
this
and
other
assistance
an
apparatus
was
devised
which
indicated
the
locality
of
the
ball
a
full
account
of
his
experiments
was
given
in
a
paper
read
before
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
in
august
professor
bell
continues
to
reside
in
the
united
states
of
which
he
is
a
naturalised
citizen
he
is
married
to
a
daughter
of
gardiner
hubbard
who
in
when
she
was
four
years
of
age
lost
her
hearing
by
an
illness

learned
to
converse
by
the
system
of
watching
the
lips
both
he
and

the

when
edison
was
about
seven
years
old
here
they
lived
in
an
white
surrounded
by
a
grove
and
commanding
a
fine
view
of
the
broad
river
with
the
canadian
hills
beyond
his
mother
undertook
his
education
and
with
the
exception
of
two
months
he
never
went
to
school
she
directed
his
opening
mind
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
often
read
aloud
to
the
family
in
the
evening
she
and
her
son
were
a
loving
pair
and
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
although
she
died
on
april
before
he
finally
emerged
from
his
difficulties
her
end
was
brightened
by
the
first
rays
of
his
coming
glory
edison
tells
us
that
his
son
never
had
any
boyhood
in
the
ordinary
sense
his
early
playthings
being
and
the
mechanical
powers
but
it
is
like
enough
that
he
trapped
a
now
and
then
or
caught
a
with
the
rest
he
was
greedy
of
knowledge
and
by
the
age
of
ten
had
read
the
penny
encyclopaedia
hume
history
of
england
dubigne
history
of
the
reformation
gibbon
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
history
of
the
world
his
father
we
are
told
encouraged
his
love
of
study
by
making
him
a
small
present
for
every
book
he
read
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
became
a
or
vendor
of
candy
fruit
and
journals
to
the
passengers
on
the
grand
trunk
railway
between
port
huron
and
detroit
the
post
enabled
him
to
sleep
at
home
and
to
extend
his
reading
by
the
public
library
at
detroit
like
the
boy
ampere
he
proposed
it
is
said
to
master
the
whole
collection
shelf
by
shelf
and
worked
his
way
through
fifteen
feet
of
the
bottom
one
before
he
began
to
select
his
fare
even
the
principia
of
newton
never
daunted
him
and
if
he
did
not
understand
the
problems
which
have
puzzled
some
of
the
greatest
minds
he
read
them
religiously
and
pressed
on
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
ure
dictionary
of
chemistry
did
not
come
amiss
but
in
victor
hugo
les
miserables
and
the
toilers
of
the
sea
he
found
a
treasure
after
his
own
heart
like
ampere
too
he
was
noted
for
a
memory
which
retained
many
of
the
facts
thus
impressed
upon
it
as
the
sounds
are
printed
on
a
phonogram
the
boy
student
was
also
a
keen
man
of
business
and
his
pursuit
of
knowledge
in
the
evening
did
not
sap
his
enterprises
of
the
day
he
soon
acquired
a
virtual
monopoly
for
the
sale
of
newspapers
on
the
line
and
employed
four
boy
assistants
his
annual
profits
amounted
to
about
dollars
which
were
a
substantial
aid
to
his
parents
to
increase
the
sale
of
his
papers
he
telegraphed
the
headings
of
the
war
news
to
the
stations
in
advance
of
the
trains
and
placarded
them
to
tempt
the
passengers
ere
long
he
conceived
the
plan
of
publishing
a
newspaper
of
his
own
having
bought
a
quantity
of
old
type
at
the
office
of
the
detroit
free
press
he
installed
it
in
a
spingless
car
or
of
the
train
meant
for
a
but
too
uninviting
to
be
much
used
by
the
passengers
here
he
set
the
type
and
printed
a
smallsheet
about
a
foot
square
by
pressing
it
with
his
hand
the
grand
trunk
herald
as
he
called
it
was
a
weekly
organ
price
three
cents
containing
a
variety
of
local
news
and
gossip
of
the
line
it
was
probably
the
only
journal
ever
published
on
a
railway
train
at
all
events
with
a
boy
for
editor
and
staff
printer
and
publisher
and
hawker
robert
stephenson
then
building
the
tubular
bridge
at
montreal
was
taken
with
the
venture
and
ordered
an
extra
edition
for
his
own
use
the
london
times
correspondent
also
noticed
the
paper
as
a
curiosity
of
journalism
this
was
a
foretaste
of
notoriety
unluckily
however
the
boy
did
not
keep
his
scientific
and
literary
work
apart
and
the
was
transformed
into
a
laboratory
as
well
as
a
printing
house
having
procured
a
copy
of
fresenius
qualitive
analysis
and
some
old
chemical
gear
he
proceeded
to
improve
his
leisure
by
making
experiments
one
day
through
an
extra
jolt
of
the
car
a
bottle
of
phosphorus
broke
on
the
floor
and
the
car
took
fire
the
incensed
conductor
of
the
train
after
boxing
his
ears
evicted
him
with
all
his
chattels
finding
an
asylum
in
the
basement
of
his
father
house
where
he
took
the
precaution
to
label
all
his
bottles
he
began
the
publication
of
a
new
and
better
journal
entitled
the
paul
pry
it
boasted
of
several
contributors
and
a
list
of
regular
subscribers
one
of
these
mr
while
smarting
under
what
he
considered
a
malicious
libel
met
the
editor
one
day
on
the
brink
of
the
clair
and
taking
the
law
into
his
own
hands
soused
him
in
the
river
the
editor
avenged
his
insulted
dignity
by
excluding
the
subscriber
name
from
the
pages
of
the
paul
pry
youthful
genius
is
apt
to
prove
unlucky
and
another
story
we
hope
they
are
all
true
though
we
can
not
vouch
for
them
is
told
of
his
partiality
for
riding
with
the
on
the
locomotive
after
he
had
gained
an
insight
into
the
working
of
the
locomotive
he
would
run
the
train
himself
but
on
one
occasion
he
pumped
so
much
water
into
the
boiler
that
it
was
shot
from
the
funnel
and
deluged
the
engine
with
soot
by
using
his
eyes
and
haunting
the
machine
shops
he
was
able
to
construct
a
model
of
a
locomotive
but
his
employment
of
the
telegraph
seems
to
have
diverted
his
thoughts
in
that
direction
and
with
the
help
of
a
book
on
the
telegraph
he
erected
a
makeshift
line
between
his
new
laboratory
and
the
house
of
james
ward
one
of
his
boy
helpers
the
conductor
was
run
on
trees
and
insulated
with
bottles
and
the
apparatus
was
but
it
seems
to
have
been
of
some
use
james
reid
author
of
the
telegraph
in
america
would
have
us
believe
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
utilise
the
electricity
obtained
by
rubbing
a
cat
connected
up
in
lieu
of
a
battery
but
the
spirit
of
artemus
ward
is
by
no
means
dead
in
the
united
states
and
the
anecdote
may
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
such
an
experiment
was
at
all
events
predestined
to
an
ignominious
failure
an
act
of
heroism
was
the
in
his
career
one
day
at
the
risk
of
his
life
he
saved
the
child
of
the
at
mount
clemens
near
port
huron
from
being
run
over
by
an
approaching
train
and
the
grateful
father
j
mackenzie
learning
of
his
interest
in
the
telegraph
offered
to
teach
him
the
art
of
sending
and
receiving
messages
after
his
daily
service
was
over
edison
returned
to
mount
clemens
on
a
luggage
train
and
received
his
lesson
at
the
end
of
five
months
while
only
sixteen
years
of
age
he
forsook
the
trains
and
accepted
an
offer
of
dollars
a
month
with
extra
pay
for
overtime
as
operator
in
the
telegraph
office
at
port
huron
a
small
installation
in
a
jewelry
store
he
worked
hard
to
acquire
more
skill
and
after
six
months
finding
his
extra
pay
withheld
he
obtained
an
engagement
as
night
operator
at
stratford
in
canada
to
keep
him
awake
the
operator
was
required
to
report
the
word
an
office
call
every
to
the
manager
of
the
circuit
edison
fulfilled
the
regulation
by
inventing
a
simple
device
which
transmitted
the
required
signals
it
consisted
of
a
wheel
with
the
characters
cut
on
the
rim
and
connected
with
the
circuit
in
such
a
way
that
the
night
watchman
by
turning
the
wheel
could
transmit
the
signals
while
edison
slept
or
studied
his
employment
at
stratford
came
to
a
grievous
end
one
night
he
received
a
service
message
ordering
a
certain
train
to
stop
and
before
showing
it
to
the
conductor
he
perhaps
for
greater
certainty
repeated
it
back
again
when
he
rushed
out
of
the
office
to
deliver
it
the
train
was
gone
and
a
collision
seemed
inevitable
but
fortunately
the
opposing
trains
met
on
a
straight
portion
of
the
track
and
the
accident
was
avoided
the
superintendent
of
the
railway
threatened
to
prosecute
edison
who
was
thoroughly
frightened
and
returned
home
without
his
baggage
during
this
vacation
at
port
huron
his
ingenuity
showed
itself
in
a
more
creditable
guise
an
occurred
on
the
clair
and
broke
the
telegraph
cable
between
port
huron
and
sarnia
on
the
opposite
shore
communication
was
therefore
interrupted
until
edison
mounted
a
locomotive
and
sounded
the
whistle
in
short
and
long
calls
according
to
the
or
telegraphic
code
after
a
time
the
reporter
at
sarnia
caught
the
idea
and
messages
were
exchanged
by
the
new
system
his
next
situation
was
at
adrian
in
michigan
where
he
fitted
up
a
small
shop
and
employed
his
spare
time
in
repairing
telegraph
apparatus
and
making
crude
experiments
one
day
he
violated
the
rules
of
the
office
by
monopolising
the
use
of
the
line
on
the
strength
of
having
a
message
from
the
superintendent
and
was
discharged
he
was
next
engaged
at
fort
wayne
and
behaved
so
well
that
he
was
promoted
to
a
station
at
indianapolis
while
there
he
invented
an
repeater
by
which
a
message
is
received
on
one
line
and
simultaneously
transmitted
on
another
without
the
assistance
of
an
operator
like
other
young
operators
he
was
ambitious
to
send
or
receive
the
night
reports
for
the
press
which
demand
the
highest
speed
and
accuracy
of
sending
but
although
he
tried
to
overcome
his
faults
by
the
device
of
employing
an
auxiliary
receiver
working
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
direct
one
he
was
found
incompetent
and
transferred
to
a
day
wire
at
cincinnati
determined
to
excel
however
he
took
shift
for
the
night
men
as
often
as
he
could
and
after
several
months
when
a
delegation
of
cleveland
operators
came
to
organise
a
branch
of
the
telegraphers
union
and
the
night
men
were
out
on
he
received
the
press
reports
as
well
as
he
was
able
working
all
the
night
for
this
feat
his
salary
was
raised
next
day
from
to
one
hundred
and
five
dollars
and
he
was
appointed
to
the
louisville
circuit
one
of
the
most
desirable
in
the
office
the
clerk
at
louisville
was
bob
martin
one
of
the
most
expert
telegraphists
in
america
and
edison
soon
became
a
operator
in
tempted
by
a
better
salary
he
removed
to
memphis
where
he
found
an
opportunity
of
introducing
his
automatic
repeater
thus
enabling
louisville
to
communicate
with
new
orleans
without
an
intermediary
clerk
for
this
innovation
he
was
complimented
but
nothing
more
he
embraced
the
subject
of
duplex
telegraphy
or
the
simultaneous
transmission
of
two
messages
on
the
same
wire
one
from
each
end
but
his
efforts
met
with
no
encouragement
men
of
routine
are
apt
to
look
with
disfavour
on
men
of
originality
they
do
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
from
the
official
groove
and
if
they
are
not
jealous
of
improvement
they
have
often
a
contempt
or
suspicion
of
the
servant
who
is
given
to
invention
thinking
him
an
oddity
who
is
wasting
time
which
might
be
better
employed
in
the
usual
way
a
telegraph
operator
in
their
eyes
has
no
business
to
invent
his
place
is
to
sit
at
his
instrument
and
send
or
receive
the
messages
as
fast
as
he
can
without
troubling
his
mind
with
inventions
or
anything
else
when
his
shift
is
over
he
can
amuse
himself
as
he
likes
provided
he
is
always
fit
for
work
genius
is
not
wanted
the
clerks
themselves
reckless
of
a
culture
which
is
not
required
and
having
a
good
string
to
their
bow
in
the
matter
of
livelihood
namely
the
mechanical
art
of
signalling
are
prone
to
lead
a
careless
gay
and
superficial
life
roving
from
town
to
town
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
states
but
for
his
genius
and
aspirations
edison
might
have
yielded
to
the
seductions
of
this
free
and
frivolous
existence
dissolute
comrades
at
memphis
won
upon
his
good
nature
but
though
he
lent
them
money
he
remained
abstemious
working
hard
and
spending
his
leisure
upon
books
and
experiments
to
them
he
appeared
an
extraordinary
fellow
and
so
far
from
sympathising
with
his
inventions
they
dubbed
him
and
regarded
him
as
daft
what
with
the
money
he
had
lent
or
spent
on
books
or
apparatus
when
the
memphis
lines
were
transferred
from
the
government
to
a
private
company
and
edison
was
discharged
he
found
himself
without
a
dollar
transported
to
decatur
he
walked
to
nashville
where
he
found
another
operator
william
foley
in
the
like
straits
and
they
went
in
company
to
louisville
foley
reputation
as
an
operator
was
none
of
the
best
but
on
his
recommendation
edison
obtained
a
situation
and
supported
foley
until
he
too
got
employment
the
squalid
office
was
infested
with
rats
and
its
discipline
was
lax
in
all
save
speed
and
quality
of
work
and
some
of
his
companions
were
of
a
dissipated
stamp
to
add
to
his
discomforts
the
line
he
worked
was
old
and
defective
but
he
improved
the
signals
by
adjusting
three
sets
of
instruments
and
utilising
them
for
three
different
states
of
the
line
during
nearly
two
years
of
drudgery
under
these
depressing
circumstances
edison
prospects
of
becoming
an
inventor
seemed
further
off
than
ever
perhaps
he
began
to
fear
that
stern
necessity
would
grind
him
down
and
keep
him
struggling
for
a
livelihood
none
of
his
improvements
had
brought
him
any
advantage
his
efforts
to
invent
had
been
ridiculed
and
discountenanced
nobody
had
recognised
his
talent
at
least
as
a
thing
of
value
and
worthy
of
encouragement
let
alone
support
all
his
promotion
had
come
from
trying
to
excel
in
his
routine
work
perhaps
he
lost
faith
in
himself
or
it
may
be
that
the
glowing
accounts
he
received
of
south
america
induced
him
to
seek
his
fortune
there
at
all
events
he
caught
the
for
emigration
that
swept
the
southern
states
on
the
conclusion
of
the
civil
war
and
resolved
to
emigrate
with
two
companions
keen
and
warren
but
on
their
arriving
at
new
orleans
the
vessel
had
sailed
in
this
predicament
edison
fell
in
with
a
travelled
spaniard
who
depicted
the
inferiority
of
other
countries
and
especially
of
south
america
in
such
vivid
colours
that
he
changed
his
intention
and
returned
home
to
michigan
after
a
pleasant
holiday
with
his
friends
he
resumed
his
occupation
in
the
louisville
office
contact
with
home
seems
to
have
charged
him
with
fresh
courage
he
wrote
a
work
on
electricity
which
for
lack
of
means
was
never
published
and
improved
his
penmanship
until
he
could
write
a
fair
round
backhand
at
the
rate
of
words
a
minute
that
is
to
say
the
utmost
that
an
operator
can
send
by
the
morse
code
the
style
was
chosen
for
its
clearness
each
letter
being
distinctly
formed
with
little
or
no
shading
his
comrades
were
no
better
than
before
on
returning
from
his
work
in
the
small
hours
edison
would
sometimes
find
two
or
three
of
them
asleep
in
his
bed
with
their
boots
on
and
have
to
shift
them
to
the
floor
in
order
that
he
might
in
a
new
office
was
opened
but
strict
orders
were
issued
that
nobody
was
to
interfere
with
the
instruments
and
their
connections
he
could
not
resist
the
infringement
of
this
rule
however
and
continued
his
experiments
in
drawing
some
vitriol
one
night
he
upset
the
carboy
and
the
acid
eating
its
way
through
the
floor
played
havoc
with
the
furniture
of
a
luxurious
bank
in
the
flat
below
he
was
discharged
for
this
but
soon
obtained
another
engagement
as
a
press
operator
in
cincinnati
he
spent
his
leisure
in
the
mechanics
library
studying
works
on
electricity
and
general
science
he
also
developed
his
ideas
on
the
duplex
system
and
if
they
were
not
carried
out
they
at
least
directed
him
to
the
quadruplex
system
with
which
his
name
was
afterwards
associated
these
attempts
to
improve
his
time
seem
to
have
made
him
unpopular
for
after
a
short
term
in
cincinnati
he
returned
to
port
huron
a
friend
adams
operator
in
the
boston
office
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
recommended
edison
to
his
manager
milliken
as
a
good
man
to
work
the
new
york
wire
and
the
berth
was
offered
to
edison
by
telegraph
he
accepted
and
left
at
once
for
boston
by
the
grand
trunk
railway
but
the
train
was
snowed
up
for
two
days
near
the
bluffs
of
the
lawrence
the
consequence
might
have
been
serious
had
provisions
not
been
found
by
a
party
of
foragers
milliken
was
the
first
of
edison
masters
and
perhaps
his
fellows
who
appreciated
him
mediocrity
had
only
seen
the
gawky
stripling
with
his
moonstruck
air
and
pestilent
habit
of
trying
some
new
crotchet
himself
an
inventor
milliken
recognised
in
his
eye
and
musing
brow
the
fire
of
a
suppressed
genius
he
was
then
just
the
friendship
of
milliken
and
the
opportunity
for
experiment
rendered
the
boston
office
a
congenial
one
his
were
spent
in
a
little
workshop
he
had
opened
among
his
inventions
at
this
period
were
a
dial
telegraph
and
a
for
use
on
private
lines
and
an
vote
recorder
which
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
declined
to
adopt
with
the
assistance
of
pope
patent
adviser
to
the
western
union
telegraph
company
his
duplex
system
was
tried
with
encouraging
results
the
ready
ingenuity
of
edison
is
shown
by
his
device
for
killing
the
cockroaches
which
overran
the
boston
office
he
arranged
some
strips
of
tinfoil
on
the
wall
and
connected
these
to
the
poles
of
a
battery
in
such
a
way
that
when
the
insects
ran
towards
the
bait
which
he
had
provided
they
stepped
from
one
foil
to
the
other
and
completed
the
circuit
of
the
current
thus
receiving
a
smart
shock
which
dislodged
them
into
a
pail
of
water
standing
below
in
after
two
years
in
boston
where
he
had
spent
all
his
earnings
chiefly
on
his
books
and
workshop
he
found
himself
in
new
york
tramping
the
streets
on
the
outlook
for
a
job
and
all
but
destitute
after
repeated
failures
he
chanced
to
enter
the
office
of
the
laws
gold
reporting
telegraph
company
while
the
instrument
which
laws
had
invented
to
report
the
fluctuations
of
the
money
market
had
broken
down
no
one
could
set
it
right
there
was
a
fever
in
the
market
and
laws
we
are
told
was
in
despair
edison
volunteered
to
set
it
right
and
though
his
appearance
was
unpromising
he
was
allowed
to
try
the
insight
of
the
born
mechanic
the
sleight
of
hand
which
marks
the
true
experimenter
have
in
them
something
magical
to
the
ignorant
in
edison
hands
the
instrument
seemed
to
rectify
itself
this
was
his
golden
opportunity
he
was
engaged
by
the
company
and
henceforth
his
career
as
an
inventor
was
secure
the
gold
indicator
company
afterwards
gave
him
a
responsible
position
he
improved
their
indicator
and
invented
the
gold
and
stock
quotation
printer
an
apparatus
for
a
similar
purpose
he
entered
into
partnership
with
pope
and
ashley
and
introduced
the
pope
and
edison
printer
a
private
line
which
he
established
was
taken
over
by
the
gold
and
stock
telegraph
company
and
soon
their
system
was
worked
almost
exclusively
with
invention
he
was
retained
in
their
service
and
that
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
as
a
salaried
inventor
they
having
the
option
of
buying
all
his
telegraphic
inventions
at
a
price
to
be
agreed
upon
at
their
expense
a
large
electrical
factory
was
established
under
his
direction
at
newark
new
jersey
where
he
was
free
to
work
out
his
ideas
and
manufacture
his
apparatus
now
that
he
was
emancipated
from
drudgery
and
fairly
started
on
the
walk
which
nature
had
intended
for
him
he
rejoiced
in
the
prolific
freedom
of
his
mind
which
literally
teemed
with
projects
his
brain
was
no
longer
a
prey
to
itself
from
the
action
or
waste
energy
of
restrained
ideas
and
revolving
thoughts
the
term
action
is
applied
by
electricians
to
the
waste
which
goes
on
in
a
voltaic
battery
although
its
current
is
not
flowing
in
the
outer
circuit
and
doing
useful
work
if
anything
he
attempted
too
much
patents
were
taken
out
by
the
score
and
at
one
time
there
were
no
less
than
distinct
inventions
in
progress
the
commissioner
of
patents
described
him
as
young
man
who
kept
the
path
to
the
patent
office
hot
with
his
footsteps
his
capacity
for
labouring
without
rest
is
very
remarkable
on
one
occasion
after
improving
his
gold
and
stock
quotation
printer
an
order
for
the
new
instruments
to
the
extent
of
dollars
arrived
at
the
factory
the
model
had
acted
well
but
the
first
instruments
made
after
it
proved
a
failure
edison
thereupon
retired
to
the
upper
floor
of
the
factory
with
some
of
his
best
workmen
and
intimated
that
they
must
all
remain
there
until
the
defect
was
put
right
after
sixty
hours
of
continuous
toil
the
fault
was
remedied
and
edison
went
to
bed
where
he
slept
for
hours
johnson
one
of
his
assistants
informs
us
that
for
ten
years
he
worked
on
an
average
eighteen
hours
a
day
and
that
he
has
been
known
to
continue
an
experiment
for
three
months
day
and
night
with
the
exception
of
a
nap
from
six
to
nine
of
the
morning
in
the
throes
of
invention
and
under
the
inspiration
of
his
ideas
he
is
apt
to
make
no
distinction
between
day
and
night
until
he
arrives
at
a
result
which
he
considers
to
be
satisfactory
one
way
or
the
other
his
meals
are
brought
to
him
in
the
laboratory
and
hastily
eaten
although
his
dwelling
is
quite
near
long
watchfulness
and
labour
seem
to
heighten
the
activity
of
his
mind
which
under
its
wind
so
to
speak
becomes
preternaturally
keen
and
suggestive
he
likes
best
to
work
at
night
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
his
laboratory
when
the
noise
of
the
benches
or
the
rumble
of
the
engines
is
stilled
and
all
the
world
about
him
is
asleep
fortunately
he
can
work
without
stimulants
and
when
the
strain
is
over
rest
without
narcotics
otherwise
his
exhausted
constitution
sound
as
it
is
would
probably
break
down
still
he
appears
to
be
ageing
before
his
time
and
some
of
his
assistants
not
so
well
endowed
with
vitality
have
we
believe
overtaxed
their
strength
in
trying
to
keep
up
with
him
at
this
period
he
devised
his
electric
pen
an
ingenious
device
for
making
copies
of
a
document
it
consists
essentially
of
a
needle
rapidly
jogged
up
and
down
by
means
of
an
actuated
by
an
intermittent
current
of
electricity
the
writing
is
traced
with
the
needle
which
perforates
another
sheet
of
paper
underneath
thus
forming
a
which
when
placed
on
a
clean
paper
and
evenly
inked
with
a
rolling
brush
reproduces
the
original
writing
in
edison
was
married
to
miss
mary
stillwell
of
newark
one
of
his
employees
his
eldest
child
mary
estelle
was
playfully
surnamed
and
his
second

after
the
signals
of

morse
code
edison
died
several
years
ago
while
seeking
to
improve
the
method
of
duplex
working
introduced
by
steams
edison
invented
the
quadruplex
by
which
four
messages
are
simultaneously
sent
through
one
wire
two
from
each
end
brought
out
in
association
with
prescott
it
was
adopted
by
the
western
union
telegraph
company
and
later
by
the
british
post
office
the
president
of
the
western
union
reported
that
it
had
saved
the
company
dollars
a
year
in
the
construction
of
new
lines
edison
also
improved
the
bain
chemical
telegraph
until
it
attained
an
incredible
speed
bain
had
left
it
capable
of
recording
words
a
minute
but
edison
by
dint
of
searching
a
pile
of
books
ordered
from
new
york
paris
and
london
making
copious
notes
and
trying
innumerable
experiments
while
eating
at
his
desk
and
sleeping
in
his
chair
ultimately
prepared
a
solution
which
enabled
it
to
register
over
words
a
minute
it
was
exhibited
at
the
philadelphia
centenial
exhibition
in
where
it
astonished
sir
william
thomson
in
edison
sold
his
factory
at
newark
and
retired
to
menlo
park
a
sequestered
spot
near
metuchin
on
the
pennsylvania
railroad
and
about
miles
from
new
york
here
on
some
rising
ground
he
built
a
wooden
tenement
two
stories
high
and
furnished
it
as
a
workshop
and
laboratory
his
own
residence
and
the
cottages
of
his
servants
completed
the
little
colony
the
basement
of
the
main
building
was
occupied
by
his
office
a
choice
library
a
cabinet
replete
with
instruments
of
precision
and
a
large
airy
workshop
provided
with
lathes
and
steam
power
where
his
workmen
shaped
his
ideas
into
wood
and
metal
the
books
lying
about
the
designs
and
placards
on
the
walls
the
on
the
table
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
the
free
and
lightsome
behaviour
of
the
men
the
humming
at
the
benches
recalled
some
school
of
handicraft
there
were
no
rigid
hours
no
grinding
toil
under
the
jealous
eye
of
the
overseer
the
spirit
of
competition
and
commercial
rivalry
was
absent
it
was
not
a
question
of
wringing
as
much
work
as
possible
out
of
the
men
in
the
shortest
time
and
at
the
lowest
price
moreover
they
were
not
mere
mechanical
drudges
they
were
interested
in
their
jobs
which
demanded
thought
as
well
as
skill
upstairs
was
the
laboratory
proper
a
long
room
containing
an
array
of
chemicals
for
edison
likes
to
have
a
sample
of
every
kind
in
case
it
might
suddenly
be
requisite
on
the
tables
and
in
the
cupboards
were
lying
all
manner
of
telegraphic
apparatus
lenses
crucibles
and
pieces
of
his
own
inventions
a
perfect
tangle
of
telegraph
wires
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
union
were
focussed
at
one
end
of
the
room
an
forge
a
cabinet
organ
a
rusty
stove
with
an
old
pivot
chair
a
bench
well
stained
with
oils
and
acids
completed
the
equipment
of
this
curious
den
into
which
the
sunlight
filtered
through
the
chemical
jars
and
fell
in
coloured
patches
along
the
dusty
floor
the
moving
spirit
of
this
haunt
by
day
and
night
is
well
described
as
an
overgrown
he
is
a
man
of
a
slim
but
wiry
figure
about
five
feet
ten
inches
in
height
his
face
at
this
period
was
juvenile
and
beardless
the
nose
and
chin
were
shapely
and
prominent
the
mouth
firm
the
forehead
wide
and
full
above
but
not
very
high
it
was
shaded
by
dark
chestnut
hair
just
silvered
with
grey
his
most
remarkable
features
were
his
eyes
which
are
and
deeply
set
with
an
intense
and
piercing
expression
when
his
attention
was
not
aroused
he
seemed
to
retire
into
himself
as
though
his
mind
had
drifted
far
away
and
came
back
slowly
to
the
present
he
was
pale
with
nightwork
and
his
thoughtful
eyes
had
an
old
look
in
serious
moments
but
his
smile
was
boyish
and
pleasant
and
his
manner
a
trifle
shy
there
was
nothing
of
the
dandy
about
edison
he
boasted
no
jewelled
fingers
or
superfine
raiment
an
easy
coat
soiled
with
chemicals
a
battered
and
boots
guiltless
of
polish
were
good
enough
for
this
inspired
workman
an
old
silver
watch
sophisticated
with
magnetism
and
keeping
an
eccentric
time
peculiar
to
it
was
his
only
ornament
on
social
occasions
of
course
he
adopted
a
more
conventional
costume
visitors
to
the
laboratory
often
found
him
in
his
with
dishevelled
hair
and
grimy
hands
the
writer
of
night
with
edison
has
described
him
as
bending
like
a
wizard
over
the
smoky
fumes
of
some
lurid
lamps
arranged
on
a
brick
furnace
as
if
he
were
summoning
the
powers
of
darkness
is
much
after
midnight
now
says
this
author
machinery
below
has
ceased
to
rumble
and
the
tired
hands
have
gone
to
their
homes
a
hasty
lunch
has
been
sent
up
we
are
at
the
thermoscope
suddenly
a
telegraph
instrument
begins
to
click
the
inventor
strikes
a
grotesque
attitude
a
herring
in
one
hand
and
a
biscuit
in
the
other
and
with
a
voice
a
little
muffled
with
a
mouthful
of
both
translates
aloud
slowly
the
sound
intelligible

him
alone
news
of
death
of
lord
john
russell
premature
john
blanchard
whose
failure
was
announced
yesterday
has
suicided
no
that
was
a
bad
one
succeeded
in
adjusting
his
affairs
and
will
continue
in
business
his
tastes
are
simple
and
his
habits
are
plain
on
one
occasion
when
invited
to
a
dinner
at
delmonico
restaurant
he
contented
himself
with
a
slice
of
pie
and
a
cup
of
tea
another
time
he
is
said
to
have
declined
a
public
dinner
with
the
remark
that
dollars
would
not
tempt
him
to
sit
through
two
hours
of
glorification
he
dislikes
notoriety
thinking
that
a
man
is
to
be
by
what
he
does
not
by
what
is
said
about
him
but
he
likes
to
talk
about
his
inventions
and
show
them
to
visitors
at
menlo
park
in
disposition
he
is
sociable
affectionate
and
generous
giving
himself
no
airs
and
treating
all
alike
his
humour
is
native
and
peculiar
to
himself
so
there
is
some
excuse
for
the
newspaper
reporters
who
take
his
jokes
about
the
capabilities
of
nature
au
serieux
and
publish
them
for
gospel
his
assistants
are
selected
for
their
skill
and
physical
endurance
the
chief
at
menlo
park
was
charles
batchelor
a
scotchman
who
had
a
certain
interest
in
the
inventions
but
the
others
including
mathematicians
chemists
electricians
secretary
bookkeeper
and
mechanics
were
paid
a
salary
they
were
devoted
to
edison
who
though
he
worked
them
hard
at
times
was
an
indulgent
master
and
sometimes
joined
them
in
a
general
holiday
all
of
them
spoke
in
the
highest
terms
of
the
inventor
and
the
man
the
menlo
establishment
was
unique
in
the
world
it
was
founded
for
the
sole
purpose
of
applying
the
properties
of
matter
to
the
production
of
new
inventions
for
love
of
science
or
the
hope
of
gain
men
had
experimented
before
and
worked
out
their
inventions
in
the
laboratories
of
colleges
and
manufactories
but
edison
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
organise
a
staff
of
trained
assistants
to
hunt
up
useful
facts
in
books
old
and
modern
and
discover
fresh
ones
by
experiment
in
order
to
develop
his
ideas
or
suggest
new
ones
together
with
skilled
workmen
to
embody
them
in
the
fittest
manner
and
all
with
the
avowed
object
of
taking
out
patents
and
introducing
the
novel
apparatus
as
a
commercial
speculation
he
did
not
manufacture
his
machines
for
sale
he
simply
created
the
models
and
left
their
multiplication
to
other
people
there
are
different
ways
of
looking
at
nature
some
she
is
the
goddess
great
to
some
the
of
the
field
their
business
is
to
calculate
the
butter
she
will
yield
the
institution
has
proved
a
remarkable
success
from
it
has
emanated
a
series
of
marvellous
inventions
which
have
carried
the
name
of
edison
throughout
the
whole
civilised
world
expense
was
disregarded
in
making
the
laboratory
as
efficient
as
possible
the
very
best
equipment
was
provided
the
ablest
assistants
employed
and
the
profit
has
been
immense
edison
is
a
millionaire
the
royalties
from
his
patents
alone
are
said
to
equal
the
salary
of
a
prime
minister
although
edison
was
the
master
spirit
of
the
band
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
his
assistants
were
sometimes
with
himself
no
doubt
he
often
supplied
the
germinal
ideas
while
his
assistants
only
carried
them
out
but
occasionally
the
suggestion
was
nothing
more
than
this
want
something
that
will
do
i
believe
it
will
be
a
good
thing
and
can
be
done
the
assistant
was
on
his
mettle
and
either
failed
or
triumphed
the
results
of
the
experiments
and
researches
were
all
chronicled
in
a
book
for
the
new
facts
if
not
then
required
might
become
serviceable
at
a
future
time
if
a
rare
material
was
wanted
it
was
procured
at
any
cost
with
such
facilities
an
invention
is
rapidly
matured
sometimes
the
idea
was
conceived
in
the
morning
and
a
working
model
was
constructed
by
the
evening
one
day
we
are
told
a
discovery
was
made
at
and
edison
telegraphed
it
to
his
patent
agent
who
immediately
drew
up
the
specification
and
at
nine
next
morning
cabled
it
to
london
before
the
inventor
was
out
of
bed
he
received
an
intimation
that
his
patent
had
been
already
deposited
in
the
british
patent
office
of
course
the
difference
of
time
was
in
his
favour
when
edison
arrived
at
the
laboratory
in
the
morning
he
read
his
letters
and
then
overlooked
his
employees
witnessing
their
results
and
offering
his
suggestions
but
it
often
happened
that
he
became
totally
engrossed
with
one
experiment
or
invention
his
work
was
frequently
interrupted
by
curious
visitors
who
wished
to
see
the
laboratory
and
the
man
although
he
had
chosen
that
place
to
avoid
disturbance
they
were
never
denied
and
he
often
took
a
pleasure
in
showing
his
models
or
explaining
the
work
on
which
he
was
engaged
there
was
no
affectation
of
mystery
no
attempt
at
keeping
his
experiments
a
secret
even
the
laboratory
notes
were
open
to
inspection
menlo
park
became
a
kind
of
mecca
to
the
scientific
pilgrim
the
newspapers
and
magazines
despatched
reporters
to
the
scene
excursion
parties
came
by
rail
and
country
farmers
in
their
buggies
till
at
last
an
enterprising
yankee
even
opened
a
refreshment
room
the
first
of
edison
greater
inventions
in
menlo
park
was
the
telephone
professor
graham
bell
had
introduced
his
telephone
but
its
effect
was
feeble
it
is
we
believe
a
maxim
in
biology
that
a
similarity
between
the
extremities
of
a
creature
is
an
infallible
sign
of
its
inferiority
and
that
in
proportion
as
it
rises
in
the
scale
of
being
its
head
is
found
to
differ
from
its
tail
now
in
the
bell
apparatus
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
were
alike
and
hence
clerk
maxwell
hinted
that
it
would
never
be
good
for
much
until
they
became
differentiated
from
each
other
consciously
or
unconsciously
edison
accomplished
the
feat
with
the
hardihood
of
genius
he
attempted
to
devise
a
telephone
which
would
speak
out
loud
enough
to
be
heard
in
any
corner
of
a
large
hall
in
the
telephone
of
bell
the
voice
of
the
speaker
is
the
motive
power
which
generates
the
current
in
the
line
the
vibrations
of
the
sound
may
be
said
to
transform
themselves
into
electrical
undulations
hence
the
current
is
very
weak
and
the
reproduction
of
the
voice
is
relatively
faint
edison
adopted
the
principle
of
making
the
vibrations
of
the
voice
control
the
intensity
of
a
current
which
was
independently
supplied
to
the
line
by
a
voltaic
battery
the
plan
of
bell
in
short
may
be
compared
to
a
man
who
employs
his
strength
to
pump
a
quantity
of
water
into
a
pipe
and
that
of
edison
to
one
who
uses
his
to
open
a
sluice
through
which
a
stream
of
water
flows
from
a
capacious
dam
into
the
pipe
edison
was
acquainted
with
two
experimental
facts
on
which
to
base
the
invention
in
or
thereabout
he
claimed
to
have
observed
while
constructing
rheostats
or
electrical
resistances
for
making
an
artificial
telegraph
line
that
powdered
plumbago
and
carbon
has
the
property
of
varying
in
its
resistance
to
the
passage
of
the
current
when
under
pressure
the
variation
seemed
in
a
manner
proportional
to
the
pressure
as
a
matter
of
fact
powdered
carbon
and
plumbago
had
been
used
in
making
small
adjustable
rheostats
by
clerac
in
france
and
probably
also
in
germany
as
early
as
or
clerac
device
consisted
of
a
small
wooden
tube
containing
the
material
and
fitted
with
contacts
for
the
current
which
appear
to
have
adjusted
the
pressure
moreover
the
count
du
moncel
as
far
back
as
had
clearly
discovered
that
when
powdered
carbon
was
subjected
to
pressure
its
electrical
resistance
altered
and
had
made
a
number
of
experiments
on
the
phenomenon
edison
may
have
independently
observed
the
fact
but
it
is
certain
he
was
not
the
first
and
his
claim
to
priority
has
fallen
to
the
ground
still
he
deserves
the
full
credit
of
utilising
it
in
ways
which
were
highly
ingenious
and
bold
the
produced
in
was
the
first
relay
in
which
the
strength
of
the
local
current
working
the
local
telegraph
instrument
was
caused
to
vary
in
proportion
to
the
variation
of
the
current
in
the
main
line
it
consisted
of
an
with
double
poles
and
an
armature
which
pressed
upon
a
disc
or
discs
of
plumbago
through
which
the
local
current
passed
the
was
excited
by
the
main
line
current
and
the
armature
attracted
to
its
poles
at
every
signal
thus
pressing
on
the
plumbago
and
by
reducing
its
resistance
varying
the
current
in
the
local
circuit
according
as
the
main
line
current
was
strong
or
weak
the
pressure
on
the
plumbago
was
more
or
less
and
the
current
in
the
local
circuit
strong
or
weak
hence
the
signals
of
the
local
receiver
were
in
accordance
with
the
currents
in
the
main
line
edison
found
that
the
same
property
might
be
applied
to
regulate
the
strength
of
a
current
in
conformity
with
the
vibrations
of
the
voice
and
after
a
great
number
of
experiments
produced
his
transmitter
plumbago
in
powder
in
sticks
or
rubbed
on
fibres
and
sheets
of
silk
were
tried
as
the
sensitive
material
but
finally
abandoned
in
favour
of
a
small
cake
or
wafer
of
compressed
obtained
from
the
smoke
of
burning
oil
such
as
benzolene
or
rigolene
this
was
the
celebrated
button
which
on
being
placed
between
two
platinum
discs
by
way
of
contact
and
traversed
by
the
electric
current
was
found
to
vary
in
resistance
under
the
pressure
of
the
sound
waves
the
voice
was
concentrated
upon
it
by
means
of
a
mouthpiece
and
a
diaphragm
the
property
on
which
the
receiver
was
based
had
been
observed
and
applied
by
him
some
time
before
when
a
current
is
passed
from
a
metal
contact
through
certain
chemical
salts
a
lubricating
effect
was
noticeable
thus
if
a
metal
stylus
were
rubbed
or
drawn
over
a
prepared
surface
the
point
of
the
stylus
was
found
to
slip
or
every
time
a
current
passed
between
them
as
though
it
had
been
oiled
if
your
pen
were
the
stylus
and
the
paper
on
which
you
write
the
surface
each
wave
of
electricity
passing
from
the
nib
to
the
paper
would
make
the
pen
start
and
jerk
your
fingers
with
it
he
applied
the
property
to
the
recording
of
telegraph
signals
without
the
help
of
an
by
causing
the
currents
to
alter
the
friction
between
the
two
rubbing
surfaces
and
so
actuate
a
marker
which
registered
the
message
as
in
the
morse
system
this
instrument
was
called
the
and
it
occurred
to
edison
that
in
a
similar
way
the
undulatory
currents
from
his
carbon
transmitter
might
by
varying
the
friction
between
a
metal
stylus
and
the
prepared
surface
put
a
tympanum
in
vibration
and
reproduce
the
original
sounds
wonderful
as
it
may
appear
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
by
the
aid
of
a
piece
of
chalk
a
brass
pin
and
a
thin
sheet
or
disc
of
mica
he
attached
the
pin
or
stylus
to
the
centre
of
the
mica
and
brought
its
point
to
bear
on
a
cylindrical
surface
of
prepared
chalk
the
undulatory
current
from
the
line
was
passed
through
the
stylus
and
the
chalk
while
the
latter
was
moved
by
turning
a
handle
and
at
every
pulse
of
the
electricity
the
friction
between
the
pin
and
chalk
was
diminished
so
that
the
stylus
slipped
upon
its
surface
the
consequence
was
a
vibration
of
the
mica
diaphragm
to
which
the
stylus
was
attached
thus
the
undulatory
current
was
able
to
establish
vibrations
of
the
disc
which
communicated
themselves
to
the
air
and
reproduced
the
original
sounds
the
replica
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
a
large
audience
and
by
reducing
the
strength
of
the
current
it
could
be
lowered
to
a
feeble
murmur
the
combined
transmitter
and
receiver
took
the
form
of
a
small
case
with
a
mouthpiece
to
speak
into
an
on
a
hinged
bracket
for
listening
to
it
for
manipulating
the
and
battery
and
a
small
handle
by
which
to
revolve
the
little
chalk
cylinder
this
last
feature
was
a
practical
drawback
to
the
system
which
was
patented
in
the
edison
telephone
when
at
its
best
could
transmit
all
kinds
of
noises
gentle
or
harsh
it
could
lift
up
its
voice
and
cry
aloud
or
sink
it
to
a
confidential
whisper
there
was
a
slight
punchinellian
twang
about
its
utterances
which
if
it
did
not
altogether
disguise
the
individuality
of
the
distant
speaker
gave
it
the
comicality
of
a
clever
parody
and
to
hear
it
singing
a
song
and
quavering
jauntily
on
the
high
notes
was
irresistibly
funny
instrumental
notes
were
given
in
all
their
purity
and
after
the
phonograph
there
was
nothing
more
magical
in
the
whole
range
of
science
than
to
hear
that
fragment
of
common
chalk
distilling
to
the
air
the
liquid
melody
of
sweet
bells
jingling
in
tune
it
brought
to
mind
that
wonderful
stone
of
memnon
which
responded
to
the
rays
of
sunrise
it
seemed
to
the
listener
that
if
the
age
of
miracles
was
past
that
of
marvels
had
arrived
and
considering
the
simplicity
of
the
materials
and
the
obscurity
of
its
action
the
telephone
was
one
of
the
most
astonishing
of
recent
inventions
after
professor
hughes
had
published
his
discovery
of
the
microphone
edison
recognising
perhaps
that
it
and
the
carbon
transmitter
were
based
on
the
same
principle
and
having
learnt
his
knowledge
of
the
world
in
the
hard
school
of
adversity
hastily
claimed
the
microphone
as
a
variety
of
his
invention
but
imprudently
charged
professor
hughes
and
his
friend
preece
who
had
visited
edison
at
menlo
park
with
having
his
thunder
the
imputation
was
indignantly
denied
and
it
was
obvious
to
all
impartial
electricians
that
professor
hughes
had
arrived
at
his
results
by
a
path
quite
independent
of
the
carbon
transmitter
and
discovered
a
great
deal
more
than
edison
had
done
for
one
thing
edison
believed
the
action
of
his
transmitter
as
due
to
a
property
of
certain
poor
or
whereby
their
electric
resistance
varied
under
pressure
hughes
taught
us
to
understand
that
it
was
owing
to
a
property
of
loose
electrical
contact
between
any
two
conductors
the
soft
and
springy
button
of
became
no
longer
necessary
since
it
was
not
so
much
the
resistance
of
the
material
which
varied
as
the
resistance
at
the
contacts
of
its
parts
and
the
platinum
electrodes
two
metals
or
two
pieces
of
hard
carbon
or
a
piece
of
metal
and
a
piece
of
hard
carbon
were
found
to
regulate
the
current
in
accordance
with
the
vibrations
of
the
voice
edison
therefore
discarded
the
soft
and
fragile
button
replacing
it
by
contacts
of
hard
carbon
and
metal
in
short
by
a
form
of
microphone
the
carbon
or
microphone
transmitter
was
found
superior
to
the
transmitter
of
bell
but
the
latter
was
preferable
as
a
receiver
to
the
louder
but
less
convenient
chemical
receiver
of
edison
and
the
most
successful
telephonic
system
of
the
day
is
a
combination
of
the
microphone
or
new
carbon
transmitter
with
the
bell
receiver
the
a
delicate
thermoscope
was
constructed
in
and
is
the
outcome
of
edison
experiments
with
the
carbon
button
knowing
the
latter
to
be
extremely
sensitive
to
minute
changes
of
pressure
for
example
those
of
sonorous
vibrations
he
conceived
the
idea
of
measuring
radiant
heat
by
causing
it
to
elongate
a
thin
bar
or
strip
of
metal
or
vulcanite
bearing
at
one
end
on
the
button
to
indicate
the
effect
he
included
a
galvanometer
in
the
circuit
of
the
battery
and
the
button
the
apparatus
consisted
of
a
telephone
button
placed
between
two
discs
of
platinum
and
connected
in
circuit
with
the
battery
and
a
sensitive
galvanometer
the
strip
was
supported
so
that
one
end
bore
upon
the
button
with
a
pressure
which
could
be
regulated
by
an
adjustable
screw
at
the
other
the
strip
expanded
or
contracted
when
exposed
to
heat
or
cold
and
thrust
itself
upon
the
button
more
or
less
thereby
varying
the
electric
current
and
deflecting
the
needle
of
the
galvanometer
to
one
side
or
the
other
the
instrument
was
said
to
indicate
a
change
of
temperature
equivalent
to
of
a
degree
fahrenheit
it
was
tested
by
edison
on
the
sun
corona
during
the
eclipse
observations
of
july
at
rawlings
in
the
territory
of
wyoming
the
trial
was
not
satisfactory
however
for
the
apparatus
was
mounted
on
a
which
trembled
to
the
gale
and
before
he
could
get
it
properly
adjusted
the
eclipse
was
over
it
is
reported
that
on
another
trial
the
light
from
the
star
arcturus
when
focussed
on
the
vulcanite
was
capable
of
deflecting
the
needle
of
the
galvanometer
when
gelatine
is
substituted
for
vulcanite
the
humidity
of
the
atmosphere
can
also
be
measured
in
the
same
way
edison
crowning
discovery
at
menlo
park
was
the
celebrated
or
talking
machine
it
was
first
announced
by
one
of
his
assistants
in
the
pages
of
the
scientific
american
for
the
startling
news
created
a
general
feeling
of
astonishment
mingled
with
incredulity
or
faith
people
had
indeed
heard
of
the
talking
heads
of
antiquity
and
seen
the
articulating
machines
of
de
kempelen
and
faber
with
their
artificial
vocal
organs
and
complicated
levers
manipulated
by
an
operator
but
the
phonograph
was
automatic
and
returned
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
into
it
by
a
purely
mechanical
mimicry
it
captured
and
imprisoned
the
sounds
as
the
photograph
retained
the
images
of
light
the
colours
of
nature
were
lost
in
the
photograph
but
the
phonograph
was
said
to
preserve
the
qualities
even
of
the
human
voice
yet
this
wonderful
appliance
had
neither
tongue
nor
teeth
larynx
nor
pharynx
it
appeared
as
simple
as
a
a
vibrating
diaphragm
to
collect
the
sounds
and
a
stylus
to
impress
them
on
a
sheet
of
tinfoil
were
its
essential
parts
looking
on
the
record
of
the
sound
one
could
see
only
the
scoring
of
the
stylus
on
the
yielding
surface
of
the
metal
like
the
track
of
an
alpine
traveller
across
the
virgin
snow
these
puzzling
scratches
were
the
of
the
voice
speech
is
the
most
perfect
utterance
of
man
but
its
powers
are
limited
both
in
time
and
space
the
sounds
of
the
voice
are
fleeting
and
do
not
carry
far
hence
the
invention
of
letters
to
record
them
and
of
signals
to
extend
their
range
these
twin
lines
of
invention
continued
through
the
ages
have
in
our
own
day
reached
their
consummation
the
smoke
of
the
savage
the
semaphore
and
the
telegraph
have
ended
in
the
telephone
by
which
the
actual
voice
can
speak
to
a
distance
and
now
at
length
the
clay
tablet
of
the
assyrian
the
wax
of
the
ancient
greek
the
papyrus
of
the
egyptian
and
the
modern
have
culminated
in
the
phonograph
by
which
the
living
words
can
be
preserved
into
the
future
in
the
light
of
a
new
discovery
we
are
apt
to
wonder
why
our
fathers
were
so
blind
as
not
to
see
it
when
a
new
invention
has
been
made
we
ask
ourselves
why
was
it
not
thought
of
before
the
discovery
seems
obvious
and
the
invention
simple
after
we
know
them
now
that
speech
itself
can
be
sent
a
thousand
miles
away
or
heard
a
thousand
years
after
we
discern
in
these
achievements
two
goals
toward
which
we
have
been
making
and
at
which
we
should
arrive
some
day
we
marvel
that
we
had
no
prescience
of
these
and
that
we
did
not
attain
to
them
sooner
why
has
it
taken
so
many
generations
to
reach
a
foregone
conclusion
alas
they
neither
knew
the
conclusion
nor
the
means
of
attaining
to
it
man
works
from
ignorance
towards
greater
knowledge
with
very
limited
powers
his
little
circle
of
light
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
darkness
which
he
strives
to
penetrate
and
lighten
now
groping
blindly
on
its
verge
now
advancing
his
taper
light
and
peering
forward
yet
unable
to
go
far
and
even
afraid
to
venture
in
case
he
should
be
lost
to
the
infinite
intelligence
which
knows
all
that
is
hidden
in
that

how

with

rather
than
with

seen
from

at

men
have
sometimes
a
foreshadowing
of
what
will
come
to
pass
without
distinctly
seeing
it
in
mechanical
affairs
the
notion
of
a
telegraph
is
very
old
and
probably
immemorial
centuries
ago
the
poet
and
philosopher
entertained
the
idea
of
two
persons
far
apart
being
able
to
correspond
through
the
sympathetic
property
of
the
lodestone
the
string
or
lovers
telephone
was
known
to
the
chinese
and
even
the
electric
telephone
was
thought
about
some
years
before
it
was
invented
bourseul
reis
and
others
preceded
graham
bell
the
phonograph
was
more
of
a
surprise
but
still
it
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
naturally
men
and
women
had
desired
to
preserve
the
accents
as
well
as
the
lineaments
of
some
beloved
friend
who
had
passed
away
the
chinese
have
a
legend
of
a
mother
whose
voice
was
so
beautiful
that
her
children
tried
to
store
it
in
a
bamboo
cane
which
was
carefully
sealed
up
long
after
she
was
dead
the
cane
was
opened
and
her
voice
came
out
in
all
its
sweetness
but
was
never
heard
again
a
similar
idea
which
reminds
us
of
munchausen
trumpet
is
found
in
the
natural
magick
of
john
baptista
porta
the
celebrated
neapolitan
philosopher
and
published
at
london
in
he
proposes
to
confine
the
sound
of
the
voice
in
leaden
pipes
such
as
are
used
for
speaking
through
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
any
man
as
the
words
are
spoken
shall
stop
the
end
of
the
pipe
and
he
that
is
at
the
other
end
shall
do
the
like
the
voice
may
be
intercepted
in
the
middle
and
be
shut
up
as
in
a
prison
and
when
the
mouth
is
opened
the
voice
will
come
forth
as
out
of
his
mouth
that
spake
it
i
am
now
upon
trial
of
it
if
before
my
book
be
printed
the
business
take
effect
i
will
set
it
down
if
not
if
god
please
i
shall
write
of
it
elsewhere
porta
also
refers
to
the
speaking
head
of
albertus
magnus
whom
however
he
discredits
he
likewise
mentions
a
colossal
trumpeter
of
brass
stated
to
have
been
erected
in

ancient
cities

to
the

a

a
strange
and
wonderful

which
had
neither

packet
at
the
academie

phonograph
ignorance
of
the
true
nature
of
sound
had
prevented
the
introduction
of
such
an
instrument
but
modern
science
and
in
particular
the
invention
of
the
telephone
with
its
vibrating

had
paved
the
way
for
it
the
time
was
ripe
and
edison
was
the
first
to
do
it
in
spite
of
the
unbridled
fancies
of
the
poets
and
the
hints
of
ingenious
writers
the

yet
no

thought
of
this
and
it
was

inventor
to
show
them
what
was
lying
at

feet
mere
knowledge

it

from

a

is
apt
to
be

with
the

an

thereby
become

he
is
able
by

scattered

to
add
a

which
he
has

theorists
have
been
known
to
pronounce
against
a
promising
invention
which
has
afterwards
been
carried
to
success
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
if
edison
had
been
an
authority
in
acoustics
he
would
never
have
invented
the
phonograph
it
happened
in
this
wise
during
the
spring
of
he
was
trying
a
device
for
making
a
telegraph
message
received
on
one
line
automatically
repeat
itself
along
another
line
this
he
did
by
embossing
the
morse
signals
on
the
travelling
paper
instead
of
merely
inking
them
and
then
causing
the
paper
to
pass
under
the
point
of
a
stylus
which
by
rising
and
falling
in
the
indentations
opened
and
closed
a
sending
key
included
in
the
circuit
of
the
second
line
in
this
way
the
received
message
transmitted
itself
further
without
the
aid
of
a
telegraphist
edison
was
running
the
cylinder
which
carried
the
embossed
paper
at
a
high
speed
one
day
partly
as
we
are
told
for
amusement
and
partly
to
test
the
rate
at
which
a
clerk
could
read
a
message
as
the
speed
was
raised
the
paper
gave
out
a
humming
rhythmic
sound
in
passing
under
the
stylus
the
separate
signals
of
the
message
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
by
the
ear
and
the
instrument
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
a
language
of
its
own
resembling
talk
heard
indistinctly
immediately
it
flashed
on
the
inventor
that
if
he
could
emboss
the
waves
of
speech
upon
the
paper
the
words
would
be
returned
to
him
to
conceive
was
to
execute
and
it
was
but
the
work
of
an
hour
to
provide
a
vibrating

fitted
with
an
indenting

and
adapt
it

the

dwelling
on
the

he
knew
that
a
metal
tympanum
was
capable
of
vibrating
with
all
the
delicacies
of
speech
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
these
vibrations
could
be
impressed
on
a
yielding
material
as
the
morse
signals
were
embossed
upon
the
paper
the
indentations
would
reproduce
the
speech
just
as
the
furrows
of
the
paper
reproduced
the
morse
signals
the
tympanum
vibrating
in
the
curves
of
speech
was
instantly
united
in
his
imagination
with
the
embossing
stylus
and
the
long
and
short
indentations
on
the
morse
paper
the
idea
of
the
phonograph
flashed
upon
him
many
a
one
versed
in
acoustics
would
probably
have
been
restrained
by
the
practical
difficulty
of
impressing
the
vibrations
on
a
yielding
material
and
making
them
react
upon
the
reproducing
tympanum
but
edison
with
that
daring
mastery
over
matter
which
is
a
characteristic
of
his
mechanical
genius
put
it
confidently
to
the
test
soon
after
this
experiment
a
phonograph
was
constructed
in
which
a
sheet
of
tinfoil
was
wrapped
round
a
revolving
barrel
having
a
spiral
groove
cut
in
its
surface
to
allow
the
point
of
the
indenting
stylus
to
sink
into
the
yielding
foil
as
it
was
thrust
up
and
down
by
the
vibrating
tympanum
this
apparatus
the
first
phonograph
was
published
to
the
world
in
and
created
a
universal
sensation

it
is

the

was
first
publicly
exhibited
in

at
a
meeting
of
the
society
of

engineers
where
its
performances
filled
the
audience
with
astonishment

a

from

to
his
electrical

across
the

had
been
impressed
on
the
tinfoil
and
was
spoken
by
the
machine
needless
to
say
the
voice
of
the
inventor
however
imperfectly
reproduced
was
hailed
with
great
enthusiasm
which
those
who
witnessed
will
long
remember
in
this
machine
the
barrel
was
fitted
with
a
crank
and
rotated
by

a
heavy
flywheel
was
attached
to
give
it
uniformity
of

a
sheet
of
tinfoil
formed
the
record
and
the
delivery
could
be
heard
by
a
roomful
of
people
but
articulation
was
sacrificed
at
the
expense
of
loudness
it
was
as
though
a
parrot
or
a
punchinello
spoke
and
sentences
which
were
unexpected
could
not
be
understood
clearly
if
the
phonograph
were
to
become
a
practical
instrument
it
required
to
be
much
improved
nevertheless
this
apparatus
sufficiently
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
storing
up
and
reproducing
speech
music
and
other
sounds
numbers
of
them
were
made
and
exhibited
to
admiring
audiences
by
license

never
failed
to
elicit
both
amusement
and
applause
to
show
how
striking
were
its
effects
and
how
surprising
even
to
scientific
men
it
may
be
mentioned
that
a
certain
learned
savant
on
hearing
it
at
a
seance
of
the
academie
des
sciences
paris
protested
that
it
was
a
fraud
a
piece
of
trickery
or
ventriloquism
and
would
not
be
convinced
after
edison
became
too
much
engaged
with
the
development
of
the
electric
light
to
give
much
attention
to
the
phonograph
which
however
was
not
entirely
overlooked
his
laboratory
at

where
the
original

were

was
turned
into

and
edison
removed
to
new
york
until
his
new
laboratory
at
orange
new
jersey
was
completed
of
late
he
has
occupied
the
latter
premises
and
improved
the
phonograph
so
far
that
it
is
now
a
serviceable
instrument
in
one
of
his
patents
the
use
of
wax
to
take
the
records
in
place
of
tinfoil
is
indicated
and
it
is
chiefly
to
the
adoption
of
this
material
that
the
success
of
the
phonograph
is
due
wax
is
also
employed
in
the
of
tainter
and
professor
bell
which
is
merely
a
phonograph
under
another
name
numerous
experiments
have
been
made
by
edison
to
find
the
which
is
best
adapted
to
receive
the
record
and
he
has
recently
discovered
a
new
material
or
mixture
which
is
stated
to
yield
better
results
than
white
wax
the
wax
is
moulded
into
the
form
of
a
tube
or
hollow
cylinder
usually
inches
long
by
inches
in
diameter
and
inch
thick
such
a
size
is
capable
of
taking
a
thousand
words
on
its
surface
along
a
delicate
spiral
trace
and
by
paring
off
one
record
after
another
can
be
used
fifteen
times
there
are
a
hundred
or
more
lines
of
the
trace
in
the
width
of
an
inch
and
they
are
hardly
visible
to
the
naked
eye
only
with
a
magnifying
glass
can
the
undulations
caused
by
the
vibrating
stylus
be
distinguished
this
tube
of
wax
is
filed
upon
a
metal
barrel
like
a
sleeve
and
the
barrel
which
forms
part
of
a
horizontal
spindle
is
rotated
by
means
of
a
silent
controlled
by
a
very
sensitive
governor
a
motion
of
translation
is
also
given
to
the
barrel
as
it
revolves
so
that
the
marking
stylus
held
over
it
describes
a
spiral
path
upon
its
surface
in
front
of
the
wax
two
small
metal
tympanums
are
supported
each
carrying
a
fine
needle
point
or
stylus
on
its
under
centre
one
of
these
is
the
recording
diaphragm
which
prints
the
sounds
in
the
first
place
the
other
is
the
reproducing
diaphragm
which
emits
the
sounds
recorded
on
the
wax
they
are
used
one
at
a
time
as
the
machine
is
required
to
take
down
or
to
render
back
a
phonographic
message
the
recording
tympanum
which
is
about
the
size
of
a
is
fitted
with
a
mouthpiece
and
when
it
is
desired
to
record
a
sentence
the
spindle
is
started
and
you
speak
into
the
mouthpiece
the
tympanum
vibrates
under
your
voice
and
the
stylus
partaking
of
its
motion
digs
into
the
yielding
surface
of
the
wax
which
moves
beneath
and
leaves
a
tiny
furrow
to
mark
its
passage
this
is
the
sonorous
record
which
on
being
passed
under
the
stylus
of
the
reproducing
tympanum
will
cause
it
to
give
out
a
faithful
copy
of
the
original
speech
a
flexible
tube
branching
into
two
conveys
the
sound
emitted
by
the
reproducing
diaphragm
to
the
ears
this
trumpet
is
used
for
privacy
and
loudness
but
it
may
be
replaced
by
a
conical
funnel
inserted
by
its
small
end
over
the
diaphragm
which
thereby
utters
its
message
aloud
it
is
on
this
plan
that
edison
has
now
constructed
a
phonograph
which
delivers
its
reproduction
to
a
roomful
of
people
keys
and
pedals
are
provided
with
which
to
stop
the
apparatus
either
in
recording
or
receiving
and
in
the
latter
case
to
hark
back
and
repeat
a
word
or
sentence
if
required
this
is
a
convenient
arrangement
in
using
the
phonograph
for
correspondence
or
dictation
each
instrument
as
we
have
seen
can
be
employed
for

as
all

made
to
one
pattern
a
phonogram
coming
from
any
one
in
any
art
of
the
world
can
be
reproduced
in
any
other
instrument
a
little
box
with
double
walls
has
been
introduced
for
transmitting
the
phonograms
by
post
a
knife
or
cutter
is
attached
to
the
instrument
for
the
purpose
of
paring
off
an
old
message
and
preparing
a
fresh
surface
of
the
wax
for
the
reception
of
a
new
one
this
can
be
done
in
advance
while
the
new
record
is
being
made
so
that
no
time
is
lost
in
the
operation
a
small
voltaic
battery
placed
under
the
machine
serves
to
work
the
electric
motor
and
has
to
be
replenished
from
time
to
time
a
process
has
also
been
devised
for
making
copies
of
the
phonograms
in
metal
by
so
as
to
produce
permanent
records
but
even
the
wax
phonogram
may
be
used
over
and
over
again
hundreds
of
times
without
diminishing
the
fidelity
of
the
reproduction
the
entire
phonograph
is
shown
in
our

of
a

apart
from

which
might
as
in
the

the

is
purely
mechanical
the
parts
acting
with
smoothness
and
precision
these
are
chiefly
the
barrel

cylinder
c
on
which
the
hollow

is
placed
the
spindle

which
revolves
the
cylinder
and

and
the
two

which
receive

and
impress
them
on
the
soft
surface
of
the

a

of
the

and
there
are
other
ingenious
devices
for

the

that
which

with
the

is
of
course
capable
of
infinite
refinement
and
edison
is
still
at
work
improving
the
instrument
but
even
now
it
is
substantially
perfected
phonographs
have
arrived
in
london
and
through
the
kindness
of
edison
and
his
english
representative
colonel
gouraud
we
have
had
an
opportunity
of
testing
one
a
number
of
phonograms
taken
in
edison
laboratory
were
sent
over
with
the
instruments
and
several
of
them
were
caused
to
deliver
in
our
hearing
the
sounds
which
were
in
crystal
silence
there
the
first
was
a
piece
which
had
been
played
on
the
piano
quick
time
and
the
fidelity
and
loudness
with
which
it
was
delivered
by
the
hearing
tube
was
fairly
astonishing
especially
when
one
considered
the
frail
and
trace
upon
the
wax
which
had
excited
it
there
seemed
to
be
something
magical
in
the
effect
which
issued
as
it
were
from
the
machine
itself
then
followed
a
cornet
solo
concert
piece
of
cornet
violin
and
piano
and
a
very
beautiful
duet
of
cornet
and
piano
the
tones
and
cadences
were
admirably
rendered
and
the
ear
could
also
faintly
distinguish
the
noises
of
the
laboratory
speaking
was
represented
by
a
phonogram
containing
a
dialogue
between
edison
and
colonel
gouraud
which
had
been
imprinted
some
three
weeks
before
in
america
with
this
we
could
hear
the
inventor
addressing
his
old
friend
and
telling
him
to
correspond
entirely
with
the
phonograph
colonel
gouraud
answers
that
he
will
be
delighted
to
do
so
and
be
spared
the
trouble
of
writing
while
edison
rejoins
that
he
also
will
be
glad
to
escape
the
pains
of
reading
the
gallant
colonel
letters
the
sally
is
greeted
with
a
laugh
which
is
also
faithfully
rendered
one
day
a
workman
in
edison
laboratory
caught
up
a
crying
child
and
held
it
over
the
phonograph
here
is
the
phonogram
it
made
and
here
in
england
we
can
listen
to
its
wailing
for
the
phonograph
reproduces
every
kind
of
sound
high
or
low
whistling
coughing
sneezing
or
groaning
it
gives
the
accent
the
expression
and
the
modulation
so
that
one
has
to
be
careful
how
one
speaks
and
probably
its
use
will
help
us
to
improve
our
utterance
by
speaking
into
the
phonograph
and
reproducing
the
words
we
are
enabled
for
the
first
time
to
hear
ourselves
speak
as
others
hear
us
for
the
vibrations
of
the
head
are
understood
to
mask
the
voice
a
little
to
our
own
ears
moreover
by
altering
the
speed
of
the
barrel
the
voice
can
be
altered
music
can
be
executed
in
slow
or
quick
time
however
it
is
played
inaudible
notes
can
be
raised
or
lowered
as
the
case
may
be
to
audibility
the
phonograph
will
register
notes
as
low
as
ten
vibrations
a
second
whereas
it
is
well
known
the
lowest
note
audible
to
the
human
ear
is
sixteen
vibrations
a
second
the
instrument
is
equally
capable
of
service
and
entertainment
it
can
be
used
as
a
stenograph
or
a
business
man
for
instance
can
dictate
his
letters
or
instructions
into
it
and
they
can
be
copied
out
by
his
secretary
callers
can
leave
a
verbal
message
in
the
phonograph
instead
of
a
note
an
editor
or
journalist
can
dictate
articles
which
may
be
written
out
or
composed
by
the
printer
word
by
word
as
they
are
spoken
by
the
reproducer
in
his
ears
correspondence
can
be
carried
on
by
phonograms
distant
friends
and
lovers
being
able
thus
to
hear
each
other
accents
as
though
they
were
together
a
result
more
conducive
to
harmony
and
good
feeling
than
in
matters
of
business
and
diplomacy
the
phonogram
will
teach
its
users
to
be
brief
accurate
and
honest
in
their
speech
for
the
phonograph
is
a
mechanical
memory
more
faithful
than
the
living
one
its
evidence
may
even
be
taken
in
a
court
of
law
in
place
of
documents
and
it
is
conceivable
that
some
important
action
might
be
settled
by
the
voice
of
this
deus
ex
machina
will
it
therefore
add
a
new
terror
to
modern
life
shall
a
visitor
have
to
be
careful
what
he
says
in
a
neighbour
house
in
case
his
words
are
stored
up
in
some
concealed
phonograph
just
as
his
appearance
may
be
registered
by
a
detective
camera
in
ordinary
life
no
for
the
phonograph
has
its
limitations
like
every
other
machine
and
it
is
not
sufficiently
sensitive
to
record
a
conversation
unless
it
is
spoken
close
at
hand
but
there
is
here
a
chance
for
the
sensational
novelist
to
hang
a
tale
upon
the
may
make
use
of
it
to
supply
him
with
but
this
remains
to
be
seen
there
are
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
which
need
not
be
told
over
perhaps
in
railway
trains
steamers
and
other
unsteady
vehicles
it
will
for
communications
the
telephone
may
yet
be
adapted
to
work
in
conjunction
with
it
so
that
a
phonogram
can
be
telephoned
or
a
telephone
message
recorded
in
the
phonograph
such
a
is
however
a
thing
of
the
future
wills
and
other
private
deeds
may
of
course
be
executed
by
phonograph
moreover
the
instrument
which
edison
is
engaged
upon
will
probably
be
applied
to
advertising
and
communicating
purposes
the
hours
of
the
day
for
example
can
be
called
out
by
a
clock
the
starting
of
a
train
announced
and
the
merits
of
a
particular
commodity
descanted
on
all
these
uses
are
possible
but
it
is
in
a
literary
sense
that
the
phonograph
is
more
interesting
books
can
now
be
spoken
by
their
authors
or
a
good
elocutionist
and
published
in
phonograms
which
will
appeal
to
the
ear
of
the
instead
of
to
his
eye
four
cylinders
inches
long
with
a
diameter
of
says
edison
can
put
the
whole
of
nicholas
nickleby
to
the
invalid
especially
this
use
would
come
as
a
boon
and
if
the
instrument
were
a
loud
speaker
a
circle
of
listeners
could
be
entertained
how
interesting
it
would
be
to
have
nicholas
nickleby
read
to
us
in
the
voice
of
dickens
or
tam
shanter
in
that
of
burns
if
the
idea
is
developed
we
may
perhaps
have
circulating
libraries
which
issue
phonograms
and
there
is
already
some
talk
of
a
phonographic
newspaper
which
will
prattle
politics
and
scandal
at
the
addresses
sermons
and
political
speeches
may
be
delivered
by
the
phonograph
languages
taught
and
dialects
preserved
while
the
study
of
words
can
not
fail
to
benefit
by
its
performance
musicians
will
now
be
able
to
record
their
improvisations
by
a
phonograph
placed
near
the
instrument
they
are
playing
there
need
in
fact
be
no
more
chords
lovers
of
music
like
the
inventor
himself
will
be
able
to
purchase
songs
and
pieces
sung
and
played
by
eminent
performers
and
reproduce
them
in
their
own
homes
will
perhaps
let
them
out
like
books
and
customers
can
choose
their
piece
in
the
shop
by
having
it
rehearsed
to
them
in
preserving
for
us
the
words
of
friends
who
have
passed
away
the
sound
of
voices
which
are
stilled
the
phonograph
assumes
its
most
beautiful
and
sacred
character
the
egyptians
treasured
in
their
homes
the
mummies
of
their
dead
we
are
able
to
cherish
the
very
accents
of
ours
and
as
it
were
defeat
the
course
of
time
and
break
the
silence
of
the
grave
the
voices
of
illustrious
persons
heroes
and
statesmen
orators
actors
and
singers
will
go
down
to
posterity
and
visit
us
in
our
homes
a
new
pleasure
will
be
added
to
life
how
pleasant
it
would
be
if
we
could
listen
to
the
cheery
voice
of
gordon
the
playing
of
liszt
or
the
singing
of
jenny
lind
doubtless
the
rendering
of
the
phonograph
will
be
still
further
improved
as
time
goes
on
but
even
now
it
is
remarkable
and
the
inventor
must
be
considered
to
have
redeemed
his
promises
with
regard
to
it
notwithstanding
his
deafness
the
development
of
the
instrument
has
been
a
labour
of
love
to
him
and
those
who
knew
his
rare
inventive
skill
believed
that
he
would
some
time
achieve
success
it
is
his
favourite
his
most
original
and
novel
work
for
many
triumphs
of
mind
over
matter
edison
has
been
called
the
of
invention
and
the
aptness
of
the
title
is
enhanced
by
his
personal
resemblance
to
the
great
conqueror
but
the
phonograph
is
his
victory
of
austerlitz
and
like
the
of
gutenberg
it
will
assuredly
immortalise
his
name
phonograph
said
edison
of
his
favourite
my
baby
and
i
expect
it
to
grow
up
a
big
fellow
and
support
me
in
my
old
age
some
people
are
still
in
doubt
whether
it
will
prove
more
than
a
curious
plaything
but
even
now
it
seems
to
be
coming
into
practical
use
in
america
if
not
in
europe
after
the
publication
of
the
phonograph
edison
owing
it
is
stated
to
an
erroneous
description
of
the
instrument
by
a
reporter
received
letters
from
deaf
people
inquiring
whether
it
would
enable
them
to
hear
well
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
is
deaf
himself
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
invention
of
the
a
combination
of
one
large
speaking
and
two
intended
for
carrying
on
a
conversation
beyond
the
ordinary
range
of
the
voice
in
short
a
mile
or
two
it
is
said
to
render
a
whisper
audible
at
a
distance
of
yards
but
its
very
sensitiveness
is
a
drawback
since
it
gathers
up
extraneous
sounds
to
the
same
category
belongs
the
which
may
be
described
as
a
gigantic
tympanum
vibrated
by
a
piston
working
in
a
cylinder
of
compressed
air
which
is
regulated
by
the
vibrations
of
the
sound
to
be
magnified
it
was
designed
to
call
out
fog
or
other
warnings
in
a
loud
and
penetrating
tone
but
it
has
not
been
successful
the
ore
separator
is
an
application
of
magnetism
to
the
extraction
of
iron
particles
from
powdered
ores
and
unmagnetic
matter
the
ground
material
is
poured
through
a
funnel
or
and
falls
in
a
shower
between
the
poles
of
a
powerful
which
draws
the
metal
aside
thus
removing
it
from
the
dress
among
edison
toys
and
minor
inventions
may
be
mentioned
a
mill
or
wheel
driven
by
the
vibrations
of
the
air
set
up
in
speaking
it
consists
of
a
tympanum
or
drum
having
a
stylus
attached
as
in
the
phonograph
when
the
tympanum
vibrates
under
the
influence
of
the
voice
the
stylus
acts
as
a
pawl
and
turns
a
an
ingenious
smith
might
apply
it
to
the
construction
of
a
lock
which
would
operate
at
the
command

another
trifle
perhaps
worthy
of
note
is
his
ink

rises
on

solidifies
so
that
a
blind

read

edison
next
important
work
was
the
adaptation
of
the
electric
light
for
domestic
illumination
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
the
cornish
philosopher
humphrey
davy
had
discovered
that
the
electric
current
produced
a
brilliant
arch
or
of
light
when
passed
between
two
charcoal
points
drawn
a
little
apart
and
that
it
heated
a
fine
rod
of
charcoal
or
a
metal
wire
to
incandescence
that
is
to
say
a
glowing
condition
a
great
variety
of
arc
lamps
were
afterwards
introduced
and
staite
on
or
about
the
year
invented
an
incandescent
lamp
in
which
the
current
passed
through
a
slender
stick
of
carbon
enclosed
in
a
vacuum
bulb
of
glass
faraday
discovered
that
electricity
could
be
generated
by
the
relative
motion
of
a
magnet
and
a
coil
of
wire
and
hence
the
generator
or
was
ere
long
invented
and
improved
in
the
boulevards
of
paris
were
lit
by
the
arc
lamps
of
jablochkoff
during
the
season
of
the
exhibition
and
the
display
excited
a
widespread
interest
in
the
new
mode
of
illumination
it
was
too
brilliant
for
domestic
use
however
and
as
the
lamps
were
connected
one
after
another
in
the
same
circuit
like
pearls
upon
a
string
the
breakage
of
one
would
interrupt
the
current
and
extinguish
them
all
but
for
special
precautions
in
short
the
electric
light
was
not
yet
edison
in
common
with
others
turned
his
attention
to
the
subject
and
took
up
the
neglected
incandescent
lamp
he
improved
it
by
reducing
the
rod
of
carbon
to
a
mere
filament
of
charcoal
having
a
comparatively
high
resistance
and
resembling
a
wire
in
its
elasticity
without
being
so
liable
to
fuse
under
the
intense
heat
of
the
current
this
he
moulded
into
a
loop
and
mounted
inside
a
bulb
of
glass
the
bulb
was
then
exhausted
of
its
air
to
prevent
the
oxidation
of
the
carbon
and
the
whole
hermetically
sealed
when
a
sufficient
current
was
passed
through
the
filament
it
glowed
with
a
dazzling
lustre
it
was
not
too
bright
or
powerful
for
a
room
it
produced
little
heat
and
absolutely
no
fumes
moreover
it
could
be
connected
not
in
but
across
the
main
circuit
of
the
current
and
hence
if
one
should
break
the
others
would
continue
glowing
edison
in
short
had
the
electric
light
in
october
he
telegraphed
the
news
to
london
and
paris
where
owing
to
his
great
reputation
it
caused
an
immediate
panic
in
the
gas
market
as
time
passed
and
the
new
illuminant
was
backward
in
appearing
the
shares
recovered
their
old
value
edison
was
severely
blamed
for
causing
the
disturbance
but
nevertheless
his
announcement
had
been
verified
in
all
but
the
question
of
cost
the
introduction
of
a
practical
system
of
electric
lighting
employed
his
resources
for
several
years
dynamos
types
of
lamps
and
conductors
electric
meters
safety
fuses
and
other
appliances
had
to
be
invented
in
he
returned
to
new
york
to
superintend
the
installation
of
his
system
in
that
city
his
researches
on
the
dynamo
caused
him
to
devise
what
he
calls
an
engine
it
consists
of
a
kept
in
vibration
by
two
small
excited
with
three
or
four
battery
cells
it
is
capable
of
working
a
small
pump
but
is
little
more
than
a
scientific
curiosity
with
the
object
of
transforming
heat
direct
from
the
furnace
into
electricity
he
also
devised
a
generator
but
it
never
passed
beyond
the
experimental
stage
the
same
may
be
said
for
his
motor
his
motors
and
system
of
electric
railways
are
however
a
more
promising
invention
his
method
of
telegraphing
to
and
from
a
railway
train
in
motion
by
induction
through
the
air
to
a
telegraph
wire
running
along
the
line
is
very
ingenious
and
has
been
tried
with
a
fair
amount
of
success
at
present
he
is
working
at
the
a
combination
of
the
phonograph
and
the
instantaneous
photograph
as
exhibited
in
the
zoetrope
by
which
he
expects
to
produce
an
animated
picture
or
simulacrum
of
a
scene
in
real
life
or
the
drama

its
appropriate

and
sounds
edison
now
resides
at
llewellyn
park
orange
a
picturesque
suburb
of
new
york
his
laboratory
there
is
a
glorified
edition
of
menlo
park
and
realises
the
inventor
dream
the
main
building
is
of
brick
in
three
stories
but
there
are
several
annexes
each
workshop
and
testing
room
is
devoted
to
a
particular
purpose
the
machine
shops
and
dynamo
rooms
are
equipped
with
the
best
engines
and
tools
the
laboratories
with
the
finest
instruments
that
money
can
procure
there
are
drawing
photographic
and
photometric
chambers
physical
chemical
and
metallurgical
laboratories
there
is
a
fine
and
a
splendid
library
and
he
employs
several
hundred
workmen
and
assistants
all
chosen
for
their
intelligence
and
skill
in
this
retreat
edison
is
surrounded
with
everything
that
his
heart
desires
in
the
words
of
a
reporter
the
place
is
equally
capable
of
turning
out
a
or
a
cunard
steamer
it
is
probably
the
finest
laboratory
in
the
world
in
edison
accompanied
by
his
second
wife
paid
a
holiday
visit
to
europe
and
the
paris
exhibition
he
was
received
everywhere
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
the
king
of
italy
created
him
a
grand
officer
of
the
crown
of
italy
with
the
title
of
count
but
the
phonograph
speaks
more
for
his
genius
than
the
voice
of
the
multitude
the
electric
light
is
a
better
illustration
of
his
energy
than
the
ribbon
of
an
order
and
the
finest
monument
to
his
pluck
sagacity
and
perseverance
is
the
magnificent
laboratory
which
has
been
built
through
his
own
efforts
at
llewellyn
park
one
of
his
characteristic
sayings
may
be
quoted
here
is
an
exhaustless
capacity
for
work
in
detail
which
combined
with
grit
and
gumption
and
love
of
right
ensures
to
every
man
success
and
happiness

david
edwin
hughes
there
are
some
leading
electricians
who
enjoy
a
reputation
based
partly
on
their
own
efforts
and
partly
on
those
of
their
paid
assistants
edison
for
example
has
a
large
following
who
not
only
work
out
his
ideas
but
suggest
improve
and
invent
of
themselves
the
master
in
such
a
case
is
able
to
avail
himself
of
their
abilities
and
magnify
his
own
genius
so
to
speak
he
is
not
one
mind
but
the
chief
of
many
minds
and
absorbs
into
himself
the
glory
and
the
work
of
a
hundred
willing
subjects
professor
hughes
is
not
one
of
these
his
fame
is
entirely
all
that
he
has
accomplished
and
he
has
done
great
things
has
been
the
labour
of
his
own
hand
and
brain
he
is
an
artist
in
invention
working
out
his
own
conceptions
in
silence
and
retirement
with
the
love
and
this
is
but
saying
that
he
is
a
true
inventor
for
a
mere
manufacturer
of
inventions
who
employs
others
to
assist
him
in
the
work
is
not
an
inventor
in
the
old
and
truest
sense
genius
they
say
makes
its
own
tools
and
the
adage
is
strikingly
verified
in
the
case
of
professor
hughes
who
actually
discovered
the
microphone
in
his
own
and
constructed
it
of
toy
boxes
and
sealing
wax
he
required
neither
lathe
laboratory
nor
assistant
to
give
the
world
this
remarkable
and
priceless
instrument
having
first
become
known
to
fame
in
america
professor
hughes
is
usually
claimed
by
the
americans
as
a
countryman
and
through
some
error
the
very
date
and
place
of
his
birth
there
are
often
given
in
american
publications
but
we
have
the
best
authority
for
the
accuracy
of
the
following
facts
namely
that
of
the
inventor
himself
david
edwin
hughes
was
born
in
london
in
his
parents
came
from
bala
at
the
foot
of
snowdon
in
north
wales
and
in
when
david
was
seven
years
old
his
father
taking
with
him
his
family
emigrated
to
the
united
states
and
became
a
planter
in
virginia
the
elder
hughes
and
his
children
seem
to
have
inherited
the
welsh
musical
gift
for
they
were
all
accomplished
musicians
while
a
mere
child
david
could
improvise
tunes
in
a
remarkable
manner
and
when
he
grew
up
this
talent
attracted
the
notice
of
herr
hast
an
eminent
german
pianist
in
america
who
procured
for
him
the
professorship
of
music
in
the
college
of
bardstown
kentucky
hughes
entered
upon
his
academical
career
at
bardstown
in
when
he
was
nineteen
years
of
age
although
very
fond
of
music
and
endowered
by
nature
with
exceptional
powers
for
its
cultivation
professor
hughes
had
in
addition
an
inborn
liking
and
fitness
for
physical
science
and
mechanical
invention
this
duality
of
taste
and
genius
may
seem
at
first
sight
strange
but
experience
shows
that
there
are
many
men
of
science
and
inventors
who
are
also
votaries
of
music
and
art
the
source
of
this
apparent
anomaly
is
to
be
found
in
the
imagination
which
is
the
of
all
kinds
of
creation
professor
hughes
now
taught
music
by
day
for
his
livelihood
and
studied
science
at
night
for
his
recreation
thus
reversing
the
usual
order
of
things
the
college
authorities
knowing
his
proficiency
in
the
subject
also
offered
him
the
chair
of
natural
philosophy
which
became
vacant
and
he
united
the
two
seemingly
incongruous
professorships
of
music
and
physics
in
himself
he
had
long
cherished
the
idea
of
inventing
a
new
telegraph
and
especially
one
which
should
print
the
message
in
roman
characters
as
it
is
received
so
it
happened
that
one
evening
while
he
was
under
the
excitement
of
a
musical
improvisation
a
solution
of
the
problem
flashed
into
his
ken
his
music
and
his
science
had
met
at
this
nodal
point
all
his
spare
time
was
thenceforth
devoted
to
the
development
of
his
design
and
the
construction
of
a
practical
as
the
work
grew
on
his
hands
the
pale
young
student
beardless
but
careworn
became
more
and
more
engrossed
with
it
until
his
nights
were
almost
entirely
given
to
experiment
he
begrudged
the
time
which
had
to
be
spent
in
teaching
his
classes
and
the
fatigue
was
telling
upon
his
health
so
in
he
removed
to
bowlingreen
in
warren
kentucky
where
he
acquired
more
freedom
by
taking
pupils
the
main
principle
of
his
was
the
printing
of
each
letter
by
a
single
current
the
morse
instrument
then
the
principal
receiver
in
america
required
on
the
other
hand
an
average
of
three
currents
for
each
signal
in
order
to
carry
out
this
principle
it
was
necessary
that
the
sending
and
receiving
apparatus
should
keep
in
strict
time
with
each
other
or
be
synchronous
in
action
and
to
effect
this
was
the
prime
difficulty
which
professor
hughes
had
to
overcome
in
his
work
in
estimating
the
hughes
as
an
invention
we
must
not
forget
the
state
of
science
at
that
early
period
he
had
to
devise
his
own
governors
for
the
synchronous
mechanism
and
here
his
knowledge
of
acoustics
helped
him
centrifugal
governors
and
pendulums
would
not
do
and
he
tried
vibrators
such
as
and
he
at
last
found
what
he
wanted
in
two
darning
needles
borrowed
from
an
old
lady
in
the
house
where
he
lived
these
steel
rods
fixed
at
one
end
vibrated
with
equal
periods
and
could
be
utilised
in
such
a
way
that
the
printing
wheel
could
be
corrected
into
absolute
synchronism
by
each
signal
current
in
professor
hughes
went
to
louisville
to
superintend
the
making
of
his
first
instrument
but
it
was
unprotected
by
a
patent
in
the
united
states
until
in
that
form
straight
vibrators
were
used
as
governors
and
a
separate
train
of
was
employed
in
correcting
but
in
later
forms
the
spiral
governor
was
adopted
and
the
printing
and
correcting
is
now
done
by
the
same
action
in
the
invention
may
be
said
to
have
become
fit
for
employment
and
no
sooner
was
this
the
case
than
professor
hughes
received
a
telegram
from
the
editors
of
the
new
york
associated
press
summoning
him
to
that
city
the
american
telegraph
company
then
a
leading
one
was
in
possession
of
the
morse
instrument
and
levied
rates
for
transmission
of
news
which
the
editors
found
oppressive
they
took
up
the
hughes
instrument
in
opposition
to
the
morse
and
introduced
it
on
the
lines
of
several
companies
after
a
time
however
the
separate
companies
amalgamated
into
one
large
corporation
the
western
union
telegraph
company
of
with
the
morse
hughes
and
other
apparatus
in
its
power
the
editors
were
again
left
in
the
lurch
in
professor
hughes
leaving
his
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
came
to
england
to
effect
its
introduction
here
he
endeavoured
to
get
the
old
electric
telegraph
company
to
adopt
it
but
after
two
years
of
indecision
on
their
part
he
went
over
to
france
in
where
he
met
with
a
more
encouraging
reception
the
french
government
telegraph
administration
became
at
once
interested
in
the
new
receiver
and
a
commission
of
eminent
electricians
consisting
of
du
moncel
blavier
froment
gaugain
and
other
practical
and
theoretical
specialists
was
appointed
to
decide
on
its
merits
the
first
trial
of
the
took
place
on
the
paris
to
lyons
circuit
and
there
is
a
little
anecdote
connected
with
it
which
is
worthy
of
being
told
the
instrument
was
started
and
for
a
while
worked
as
well
as
could
be
desired
but
suddenly
it
came
to
a
stop
and
to
the
utter
discomfiture
of
the
inventor
he
could
neither
find
out
what
was
wrong
nor
get
the
printer
to
go
again
in
the
midst
of
his
confusion
it
seemed
like
satire
to
him
to
hear
the
commissioners
say
as
they
smiled
all
round
and
bowed
themselves
gracefully
off
monsieur
hughes
je
vous
felicite
but
the
matter
was
explained
next
morning
when
professor
hughes
learned
that
the
transmitting
clerk
at
lyons
had
been
purposely
instructed
to
earth
the
line
at
the
time
in
question
to
test
whether
there
was
no
deception
in
the
trial
a
proceeding
which
would
have
seemed
strange
had
not
the
occurrence
of
a
sham
trial
some
months
previous
rendered
it
a
prudent
course
the
result
of
this
trial
was
that
the
french
government
agreed
to
give
the
printer
a
year
of
practical
work
on
the
french
lines
and
if
found
satisfactory
it
was
to
be
finally
adopted
daily
reports
were
furnished
of
its
behaviour
during
that
time
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
it
was
adopted
and
professor
hughes
was
constituted
by
napoleon
iii
a
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
the
patronage
of
france
paved
the
way
of
the
into
almost
all
other
european
countries
and
the
french
agreement
as
to
its
use
became
the
model
of
those
made
by
the
other
nations
on
settling
with
france
in
professor
hughes
went
to
italy
here
a
commission
was
likewise
appointed
and
a
period
of
probation
only
six
months
was
settled
before
the
instrument
was
taken
over
from
italy
professor
hughes
received
the
order
of
maurice
and
lazare
in
the
united
kingdom
telegraph
england
introduced
the
in
their
system
in
professor
hughes
proceeded
to
russia
and
in
that
country
his
invention
was
adopted
after
six
months
trial
on
the
petersburg
to
moscow
circuit
at
petersburg
he
had
the
honour
of
being
a
guest
of
the
emperor
in
the
summer
palace
czarskoizelo
the
versailles
of
russia
where
he
was
requested
to
explain
his
invention
and
also
to
give
a
lecture
on
electricity
to
the
czar
and
his
court
he
was
there
created
a
commander
of
the
order
of
anne
in
professor
hughes
also
went
to
berlin
and
introduced
his
apparatus
on
the
prussian
lines
in
he
went
on
a
similar
mission
to
austria
where
he
received
the
order
of
the
iron
crown
and
to
turkey
where
the
reigning
sultan
bestowed
on
him
the
grand
cross
of
the
medjidie
in
this
year
too
he
was
awarded
at
the
paris
exhibition
a
grand
hors
ligne
gold
medal
one
out
of
ten
supreme
honours
designed
to
mark
the
very
highest
achievements
on
the
same
occasion
another
of
these
special
medals
was
bestowed
on
cyrus
field
and
the
telegraph
company
in
he
introduced
it
into
holland
and
in
into
bavaria
and
wurtemburg
where
he
obtained
the
noble
order
of
michael
in
he
also
installed
it
in
switzerland
and
belgium
coming
back
to
england
the
submarine
telegraph
company
adopted
the
in
when
they
had
only
two
instruments
at
work
in
they
had
twenty
of
them
in
constant
use
of
which
number
nine
were
working
direct
between
london
and
paris
one
between
london
and
berlin
one
between
london
and
cologne
one
between
london
and
antwerp
and
one
between
london
and
brussels
all
the
continental
news
for
the
times
and
the
daily
telegraph
is
received
by
the
hughes
and
is
set
in
type
by
a
machine
as
it
arrives
further
by
the
international
telegraph
congress
it
was
settled
that
for
all
international
telegrams
only
the
hughes
instrument
and
the
morse
were
to
be
employed
since
the
post
office
acquired
the
cables
to
the
continent
in
a
room
in
has
been
provided
for
the
printers
working
to
paris
berlin
and
rome
in
professor
hughes
introduced
the
into
spain
where
he
was
made
a
commander
of
the
royal
and
distinguished
order
of
carlos
iii
in
every
country
to
which
it
was
taken
the
merits
of
the
instrument
were
recognised
and
professor
hughes
has
none
but
pleasant
souvenirs
of
his
visits
abroad
during
all
these
years
the
inventor
was
not
idle
he
was
constantly
improving
his
invention
and
in
addition
to
that
he
had
to
act
as
an
instructor
he
went
and
give
courses
of
lectures
explaining
the
principles
and
practice
of
his
apparatus
to
the
various
employees
into
whose
hands
it
was
to
be
consigned
the
years
will
be
distinguished
in
the
history
of
our
time
for
a
triad
of
great
inventions
which
so
to
speak
were
hanging
together
we
have
already
seen
how
the
telephone
and
phonograph
have
originated
and
to
these
two
marvellous
contrivances
we
have
now
to
add
a
third
the
microphone
which
is
even
more
marvellous
because
although
in
form
it
is
the
simplest
of
them
all
in
its
action
it
is
still
a
mystery
the
telephone
enables
us
to
speak
to
distances
far
beyond
the
reach
of
eye
or
ear
waft
a
sigh
from
indus
to
the
pole
phonograph
enables
us
to
seal
the
living
speech
on
brazen
tablets
and
store
it
up
for
any
length
of
time
while
it
is
the
peculiar
function
of
the
microphone
to
let
us
hear
those
minute
sounds
which
are
below
the
range
of
our
unassisted
powers
of
hearing
by
these
three
instruments
we
have
thus
received
a
remarkable
extension
of
the
capacity
of
the
human
ear
and
a
growth
of
dominion
over
the
sounds
of
nature
we
have
now
a
command
over
sound
such
as
we
have
over
light
for
the
telephone
is
to
the
ear
what
the
telescope
is
to
the
eye
the
phonograph
is
for
sound
what
the
photograph
is
for
light
and
the
microphone
finds
its
analogue
in
the
microscope
as
the
microscope
reveals
to
our
wondering
sight
the
rich
meshes
of
creation
so
the
microphone
can
interpret
to
our
ears
the
jarr
of
molecular
vibrations
for
ever
going
on
around
us
perchance
the
clash
of
atoms
as
they
shape
themselves
into
crystals
the
murmurous
ripple
of
the
sap
in
trees
which
humboldt
fancied
to
make
a
continuous
music
in
the
ears
of
the
tiniest
insects
the
fall
of
pollen
dust
on
flowers
and
grasses
the
stealthy
creeping
of
a
spider
upon
his
silken
web
and
even
the
piping
of
a
pair
of
butterflies
or
the
trumpeting
of
a
bellicose
gnat
like
the
of
faintly
blowing
the
success
of
the
hughes
may
be
said
to
have
covered
its
author
with
titles
and
scientific
honours
and
placed
him
above
the
necessity
of
regular
employment
he
left
america
and
travelled
from
place
to
place
for
many
years
past
however
he
has
resided
privately
in
london
an
eminent
example
of
that
modesty
and
simplicity
which
is
generally
said
to
accompany
true
genius
mechanical
invention
is
influenced
to
a
very
high
degree
by
external
circumstances
it
may
sound
sensational
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
we
owe
the
microphone
to
an
attack
of
bronchitis
during
the
thick
foggy
weather
of
november
professor
hughes
was
confined
to
his
home
by
a
severe
cold
and
in
order
to
divert
his
thoughts
he
began
to
amuse
himself
with
a
speaking
telephone
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
some
means
found
of
making
the
wire
of
the
telephone
circuit
speak
of
itself
without
the
need
of
telephones
at
all
or
at
least
without
the
need
of
one
telephone
namely
that
used
in
transmitting
the
sounds
the
distinguished
physicist
sir
william
thomson
had
lately
discovered
the
peculiar
fact
that
when
a
current
of
electricity
is
passed
through
a
wire
the
current
augments
when
the
wire
is
extended
and
diminishes
when
the
wire
is
compressed
because
in
the
former
case
the
resistance
of
the
material
of
the
wire
to
the
passage
of
the
current
is
lessened
and
in
the
latter
case
it
becomes
greater
now
it
occurred
to
professor
hughes
that
if
this
were
so
it
might
be
possible
to
cause
the
of
sound
to
so
act
upon
a
wire
conveying
a
current
as
to
stretch
and
contract
it
in
sympathy
with
themselves
so
that
the
would
create
corresponding
electric
waves
in
the
current
and
these
electric
waves
passed
through
a
telephone
connected
to
the
wire
would
cause
the
telephone
to
give
forth
the
original
sounds
he
first
set
about
trying
the
effect
of
vibrating
a
wire
in
which
a
current
flowed
to
see
if
the
stretching
and
compressing
thereby
produced
would
affect
the
current
so
as
to
cause
sounds
in
a
telephone
connected
up
in
circuit
with
the
wire
but
without
effect
he
could
hear
no
sound
whatever
in
the
telephone
then
he
stretched
the
wire
till
it
broke
altogether
and
as
the
metal
began
to
rupture
he
heard
a
distinct
grating
in
the
telephone
followed
by
a
sharp
when
the
wire
sundered
which
indicated
a
of
electricity
through
the
telephone
this
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
wire
might
be
sensitive
to
sound
when
in
a
state
of
fracture
acting
on
the
hint
he
placed
the
two
broken
ends
of
the
wire
together
again
and
kept
them
so
by
the
application
of
a
definite
pressure
to
his
joy
he
found
that
he
had
discovered
what
he
had
been
in
search
of
the
imperfect
contact
between
the
broken
ends
of
the
wire
proved
itself
to
be
a
means
of
transmitting
sounds
and
in
addition
it
was
found
to
possess
a
faculty
which
he
had
not
anticipated
it
proved
to
be
sensitive
to
very
minute
sounds
and
was
in
fact
a
rude
microphone
continuing
his
researches
he
soon
found
that
he
had
discovered
a
principle
of
wide
application
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
confine
his
experiments
to
wires
since
any
substance
which
conducted
an
electric
current
would
answer
the
purpose
all
that
was
necessary
was
that
the
materials
employed
should
be
in
contact
with
each
other
under
a
slight
but
definite
pressure
and
for
the
continuance
of
the
effects
that
the
materials
should
not
oxidise
in
air
so
as
to
foul
the
contact
for
different
materials
a
different
degree
of
pressure
gives
the
best
results
and
for
different
sounds
to
be
transmitted
a
different
degree
of
pressure
is
required
any
loose
crazy
unstable
structure
of
conducting
bodies
inserted
in
a
telephone
circuit
will
act
as
a
microphone
such
for
example
as
a
glass
tube
filled
with
or
black
oxide
of
iron
or
bronze
powder
under
pressure
a
metal
piled
in
a
heap
surfaces
of
platinum
gold
or
even
iron
pressed
lightly
together
give
excellent
results
three
french
nails
two
parallel
beneath
and
one
laid
across
them
or
better
still
a
of
french
nails
make
a
perfect
transmitter
of
audible
sounds
and
a
good
microphone
because
of
its
cheapness
its
conducting
power
and
its
carbon
is
the
most
select
material
a
piece
of
charcoal
no
bigger
than
a
head
is
quite
sufficient
to
produce
articulate
speech
operates
admirably
but
the
best
carbon
is
that
known
as
used
by
artists
in
sketching
and
when
this
is
impregnated
with
minute
globules
of
mercury
by
heating
it
and
quenching
it
in
liquid
mercury
it
is
in
a
highly
sensitive
microphonic
condition
the
same
kind
of
charcoal
permeated
by
platinum
tin
zinc
or
other
unoxidisable
metal
is
also
very
suitable
and
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
the
most
resonant
woods
such
as
pine
poplar
and
willow
yield
the
charcoals
best
adapted
for
the
microphone
professor
hughes
experimental
apparatus
is
of
an
amusingly
simple
description
he
has
no
laboratory
at
home
and
all
his
experiments
were
made
in
the
his
first
microphones
were
formed
of
bits
of
carbon
and
scraps
of
metal
mounted
on
slips
of
by
means
of
and
the
resonance
pipes
on
which
they
were
placed
to
reinforce
the
effect
of
minute
sounds
were
nothing
more
than
toy
money
boxes
price
one
halfpenny
having
one
of
the
ends
knocked
out
with
such
childish
and
worthless
materials
he
has
conquered
nature
in
her
strongholds
and
shown
how
great
discoveries
can
be
made
the
microphone
is
a
striking
illustration
of
the
truth
that
in
science
any
phenomenon
whatever
may
be
rendered
useful
the
trouble
of
one
generation
of
scientists
may
be
turned
to
the
honour
and
service
of
the
next
electricians
have
long
had
sore
reasons
for
regarding
a
contact
as
an
unmitigated
nuisance
the
instrument
of
the
evil
one
with
no
conceivable
good
in
it
and
no
conceivable
purpose
except
to
annoy
and
tempt
them
into
wickedness
and
an
expression
of
hearty
but
ignominious
emotion
professor
hughes
however
has
with
a
power
transformed
this
electrician
bane
into
a
professional
glory
and
a
public
boon
verily
there
is
a
soul
of
virtue
in
things
evil
the
commonest
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
sensitive
forms
of
the
instrument
is
called
the
microphone
from
the
pencil
or
crayon
of
carbon
which
forms
the
principal
part
of
it
this
pencil
may
be
of
mercurialised
charcoal
but
the
ordinary
which
incrusts
the
interior
of
the
retorts
in
is
usually
employed
the
crayon
is
supported
in
an
upright
position
by
two
little
brackets
of
carbon
hollowed
out
so
as
to
receive
the
pointed
ends
in
shallow
cups
the
weight
of
the
crayon
suffices
to
give
the
required
pressure
on
the
contacts
both
upper
and
lower
for
the
upper
end
of
the
pencil
should
lean
against
the
inner
wall
of
the
cup
in
the
upper
bracket
the
brackets
are
fixed
to
an
upright
board
of
light
dry
resonant
let
into
a
solid
base
of
the
same
timber
the
baseboard
is
with
advantage
borne
by
four
rounded
feet
which
insulate
it
from
the
table
on
which
it
may
be
placed
to
connect
the
microphone
up
for
use
a
small
voltaic
battery
say
three
cells
though
a
single
cell
will
give
surprising
results
and
a
bell
speaking
telephone
are
necessary
a
wire
is
led
from
one
of
the
carbon
brackets
to
one
pole
of
the
battery
and
another
wire
is
led
from
the
other
bracket
to
one
terminal
screw
of
the
telephone
and
the
circuit
is
completed
by
a
wire
from
the
other
terminal
of
the
telephone
to
the
other
pole
of
the
battery
if
now
the
slightest
mechanical
jar
be
given
to
the
wooden
frame
of
the
microphone
to
the
table
or
even
to
the
walls
of
the
room
in
which
the
experiment
takes
place
a
corresponding
noise
will
be
heard
in
the
microphone
by
this
delicate
arrangement
we
can
play
the
eavesdropper
on
those
insensible
vibrations
in
the
midst
of
which
we
exist
if
a
feather
or
a
pencil
be
stroked
along
the
we
hear
a
harsh
grating
sound
if
a
pin
be
laid
upon
it
we
hear
a
blow
like
a
blacksmith
hammer
and
more
astonishing
than
all
if
a
fly
walk
across
it
we
hear
it
tramping
like
a
charger
and
even
its
peculiar
cry
which
has
been
likened
with
some
allowance
for
imagination
to
the
snorting
of
an
elephant
moreover
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
wires
connecting
up
the
telephone
may
be
lengthened
to
any
desired
extent
so
that
in
the
words
of
professor
hughes
beating
of
a
pulse
the
tick
of
a
watch
the
tramp
of
a
fly
can
then
be
heard
at
least
a
hundred
miles
from
the
source
of
sound
if
we
whisper
or
speak
distinctly
in
a
monotone
to
the
pencil
our
words
will
be
heard
in
the
telephone
but
with
this
defect
that
the
timbre
or
quality
is
in
this
particular
form
of
the
instrument
apt
to
be
lost
making
it
difficult
to
recognise
the
speaker
voice
but
although
a
single
pencil
microphone
will
under
favourable
circumstances
transmit
these
varied
sounds
the
best
effect
for
each
kind
of
sound
is
obtained
by
one
specially
adjusted
there
is
one
pressure
best
adapted
for
minute
sounds
another
for
speech
and
a
third
for
louder
sounds
a
simple
spring
arrangement
for
adjusting
the
pressure
of
the
contacts
is
therefore
an
advantage
and
it
can
easily
be
applied
to
a
microphone
formed
of
a
small
rod
of
carbon
pivoted
at
its
middle
with
one
end
resting
on
a
block
or
anvil
of
carbon
underneath
the
contact
between
the
rod
and
the
block
in
this
form
is
of
course
the
portion
which
is
sensitive
to
sound
the
microphone
is
a
discovery
as
well
as
an
invention
and
the
true
explanation
of
its
action
is
as
yet
merely
an
hypothesis
it
is
supposed
that
the
vibrations
put
the
carbons
in
a
tremor
and
cause
them
to
approach
more
or
less
nearly
thus
closing
or
opening
the
breach
between
them
which
is
as
it
were
the
floodgate
of
the
current
the
applications
of
the
microphone
were
soon
of
great
importance
richardson
succeeded
in
fitting
it
for
auscultation
of
the
heart
and
lungs
while
sir
henry
thompson
has
effectively
used
it
in
those
surgical
operations
such
as
probing
wounds
for
bullets
or
fragments
of
bone
in
which
the
surgeon
has
hitherto
relied
entirely
on
his
delicacy
of
touch
for
detecting
the
jar
of
the
probe
on
the
foreign
body
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
science
of
physiology
in
the
art
of
surgery
and
in
many
other
walks
of
life
the
microphone
has
proved
a
valuable
aid
professor
hughes
communicated
his
results
to
the
royal
society
in
the
early
part
of
and
generously
gave
the
microphone
to
the
world
for
his
own
sake
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
had
he
patented
and
thus
protected
it
for
edison
recognising
it
as
a
rival
to
his
then
a
valuable
property
claimed
it
as
an
infringement
of
his
patents
and
charged
him
with
plagiarism
a
spirited
controversy
arose
and
several
bitter
lawsuits
were
the
consequence
in
none
of
which
however
professor
hughes
took
part
as
they
were
only
commercial
trials
it
was
clearly
shown
that
clerac
and
not
edison
had
been
the
first
to
utilise
the
variable
resistance
of
powdered
carbon
or
plumbage
under
pressure
a
property
on
which
the
edison
transmitter
was
founded
and
that
hughes
had
discovered
a
much
wider
principle
which
embraced
not
only
the
bodies
such
as
carbon
but
even
the
best
conductors
such
as
gold
silver
and
other
metals
this
principle
was
not
a
mere
variation
of
electrical
conductivity
in
a
mass
of
material
brought
about
by
compression
but
a
mysterious
variation
in
some
unknown
way
of
the
strength
of
an
electric
current
in
traversing
a
loose
joint
or
contact
between
two
conductors
this
discovery
of
hughes
really
shed
a
light
on
the
behaviour
of
edison
own
transmitter
whose
action
he
had
until
then
misunderstood
it
was
now
seen
that
the
particles
of
carbon
dust
in
contact
which
formed
the
button
were
a
congeries
of
minute
again
it
was
proved
that
the
diaphragm
or
tympanum
to
receive
the
impression
of
the
sound
and
convey
it
to
the
carbon
button
on
which
edison
had
laid
considerable
stress
was
for
the
microphone
pure
and
simple
was
operated
by
the
direct
impact
of
the
sonorous
waves
and
required
no
tympanum
moreover
the
microphone
as
its
name
implies
could
magnify
a
feeble
sound
and
render
audible
the
vibrations
which
would
otherwise
escape
the
ear
the
discovery
of
these
remarkable
and
subtle
properties
of
a
delicate
contact
had
indeed
confronted
edison
he
had
held
them
in
his
grasp
they
had
stared
him
in
the
face
but
all
his
matchless
ingenuity
and
acumen
he
blinded
perhaps
by
a
false
hypothesis
entirely
failed
to
discern
them
the
significant
proof
of
it
lies
in
the
fact
that
after
the
researches
of
professor
hughes
were
published
the
carbon
transmitter
was
promptly
modified
and
finally
abandoned
for
practical
work
as
a
telephone
in
favour
of
a
variety
of
new
transmitters
such
as
the
blake
now
employed
in
the
united
kingdom
in
all
of
which
the
essential
part
is
a
microphone
of
hard
carbon
and
metal
the
button
of
soot
has
vanished
into
the
limbo
of
superseded
inventions
science
appears
to
show
that
every
physical
process
is
reciprocal
and
may
be
reversed
with
this
principle
in
our
minds
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
the
microphone
should
not
only
act
as
a
transmitter
of
sounds
but
that
it
should
also
act
as
a
receiver
james
blyth
of
edinburgh
was
the
first
to
announce
that
he
had
heard
sounds
and
even
speech
given
out
by
a
microphone
itself
when
substituted
for
the
telephone
his
transmitting
microphone
and
his
receiving
one
were
simply
filled
with
cinders
from
the
grate
it
then
transpired
that
professor
hughes
had
previously
obtained
the
same
remarkable
effects
from
his
ordinary
microphones
the
sounds
were
extremely
feeble
however
but
the
transmitting
microphones
proved
the
best
articulating
ones
professor
hughes
at
length
constructed
an
adjustable
microphone
of
fixed
to
the
top
of
a
resonating
drum
which
articulated
fairly
well
although
not
so
perfectly
as
a
bell
telephone
perhaps
a
means
of
improving
both
the
volume
and
distinctness
of
the
articulation
will
yet
be
forthcoming
and
we
may
be
able
to
speak
solely
by
the
microphone
if
it
is
found
desirable
the
marvellous
fact
that
a
little
piece
of
charcoal
can
as
it
were
both
listen
and
speak
that
a
person
may
talk
to
it
so
that
his
friend
can
hear
him
at
a
similar
piece
a
hundred
miles
away
is
a
miracle
of
nineteenth
century
science
which
far
transcends
the
oracles
of
antiquity
the
articulating
telephone
was
the
forerunner
of
the
phonograph
and
microphone
and
led
to
their
discovery
they
in
turn
will
doubtless
lead
to
other
new
inventions
which
it
is
now
impossible
to
foresee
we
ask
in
vain
for
an
answer
to
the
question
which
is
upon
the
lips
of
every
next
the
microphone
has
proved
itself
highly
useful
in
strengthening
the
sounds
given
out
by
the
telephone
and
it
is
probable
that
we
shall
soon
see
those
three
inventions
working
unitedly
for
the
microphone
might
make
the
telephone
sounds
so
powerful
as
to
enable
them
to
be
printed
by
phonograph
as
they
are
received
and
thus
a
durable
record
of
telephonic
messages
would
be
obtained
we
can
now
transmit
sound
by
wire
but
it
may
yet
be
possible
to
transmit
light
and
see
by
telegraph
we
are
apparently
on
the
eve
of
other
wonderful
inventions
and
there
are
symptoms
that
before
many
years
a
great
fundamental
discovery
will
be
made
which
will
elucidate
the
connection
of
all
the
physical
forces
and
will
illumine
the
very
of
nature
in
professor
hughes
endowed
the
scientific
world
with
another
beautiful
apparatus
his
balance
briefly
described
it
is
an
arrangement
of
coils
whereby
the
currents
inducted
by
a
primary
circuit
in
the
secondary
are
opposed
to
each
other
until
they
balance
so
that
a
telephone
connected
in
the
secondary
circuit
is
quite
silent
any
disturbance
of
this
delicate
balance
however
say
by
the
movement
of
a
coil
or
a
metallic
body
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
apparatus
will
be
at
once
reported
by
the
induction
currents
in
the
telephone
being
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
minute
masses
of
metal
the
apparatus
was
applied
by
professor
graham
bell
to
indicate
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
bullet
in
the
frame
of
president
garfield
as
already
mentioned
and
also
by
captain
mcevoy
to
detect
the
position
of
submerged
torpedoes
or
lost
anchors
professor
the
chemist
to
the
mint
has
also
employed
it
with
success
in
analysing
the
purity
and
temper
of
coins
for
strange
to
say
the
induction
is
affected
as
well
by
the
molecular
quality
as
the
quantity
of
the
disturbing
metal
professor
hughes
himself
has
modified
it
for
the
purpose
of
sonometry
and
the
measurement
of
the
hearing
powers
to
the
same
year
belong
his
laborious
investigations
on
current
induction
and
some
ingenious
plans
for
eliminating
its
effects
on
telegraph
and
telephone
circuits
soon
after
his
discovery
of
the
microphone
he
was
invited
to
become
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
and
a
few
years
later
in
he
received
the
royal
medal
of
the
society
for
his
experiments
and
especially
those
of
the
microphone
in
he
represented
the
united
kingdom
as
a
commissioner
at
the
paris
international
exhibition
of
electricity
and
was
elected
president
of
one
of
the
sections
of
the
international
congress
of
electricians
in
he
filled
the
office
of
president
of
the
society
of
telegraph
engineers
and
of
electricians
the
hughes
was
a
great
mechanical
invention
one
of
the
greatest
in
telegraphic
science
for
every
organ
of
it
was
new
and
had
to
be
fashioned
out
of
chaos
an
invention
which
stamped
its
name
indelibly
into
the
history
of
telegraphy
and
procured
for
him
a
special
fame
while
the
microphone
is
a
discovery
which
places
it
on
the
roll
of
investigators
and
at
the
same
time
brings
it
to
the
knowledge
of
the
people
two
such
achievements
might
well
satisfy
any
scientific
ambition
professor
hughes
has
enjoyed
a
most
successful
career
probably
no
inventor
ever
before
received
so
many
honours
or
bore
them
with
greater
modesty

charles
ferdinand
gauss
charles
ferdinand
gauss
was
born
at
braunschweig
on
april
his
father
george
dietrich
was
a
mason
who
employed
himself
otherwise
in
the
hard
winter
months
and
finally
became
cashier
to
a
todtencasse
or
burial
fund
his
mother
dorothy
was
the
daughter
of
christian
benze
of
the
village
of
velpke
near
braunschweig
and
a
woman
of
talent
industry
and
wit
which
her
son
appears
to
have
inherited
the
father
died
in
after
his
son
had
become
distinguished
the
mother
lived
to
the
age
of
but
became
totally
blind
she
preserved
her
low
saxon
dialect
her
blue
linen
dress
and
simple
country
manners
to
the
last
while
living
beside
her
son
at
the
observatory
of
gottingen
frederic
her
younger
brother
was
a
damask
weaver
but
a
man
with
a
natural
turn
for
mathematics
and
mechanics
when
gauss
was
a
boy
his
parents
lived
in
a
small
house
in
the
wendengrahen
on
a
canal
which
joined
the
ocker
a
stream
flowing
through
braunschweig
the
canal
is
now
covered
and
is
the
site
of
the
wilhelmstrasse
but
a
tablet
marks
the
house
when
a
child
gauss
used
to
play
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
and
falling
in
one
day
he
was
nearly
drowned
he
learned
to
read
by
asking
the
letters
from
his
friends
and
also
by
studying
an
old
calendar
which
hung
on
a
wall
of
his
house
and
when
four
years
old
he
knew
all
the
numbers
on
it
in
spite
of
a
shortness
of
sight
which
afflicted
him
to
the
end
on
saturday
nights
his
father
paid
his
workmen
their
wages
and
once
the
boy
who
had
been
listening
to
his
calculations
jumped
up
and
told
him
that
he
was
wrong
revision
showed
that
his
son
was
right
at
the
age
of
seven
gauss
went
to
the
catherine
parish
school
at
braunschweig
and
remained
at
it
for
several
years
the
master
name
was
buttner
and
from
a
raised
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
kept
order
by
means
of
a
whip
suspended
at
his
side
a
bigger
boy
bartels
by
name
used
to
cut
quill
pens
and
assist
the
smaller
boys
in
their
lessons
he
became
a
friend
of
gauss
and
would
procure
mathematical
books
which
they
read
together
bartels
subsequently
rose
to
be
a
professor
in
the
university
of
dorpat
where
he
died
at
the
parish
school
the
boys
of
fourteen
to
fifteen
years
were
being
examined
in
arithmetic
one
day
when
gauss
stepped
forward
and
to
the
astonishment
of
buttner
requested
to
be
examined
at
the
same
time
buttner
thinking
to
punish
him
for
his
audacity
put
a
to
him
and
awaited
the
result
gauss
solved
the
problem
on
his
slate
and
laid
it
face
downward
on
the
table
crying
it
is
according
to
the
custom
at
the
end
of
an
hour
during
which
the
master
paced
up
and
down
with
an
air
of
dignity
the
slates
were
turned
over
and
the
answer
of
gauss
was
found
to
be
correct
while
many
of
the
rest
were
erroneous
buttner
praised
him
and
ordered
a
special
book
on
arithmetic
for
him
all
the
way
from
hamburg
from
the
parish
school
gauss
went
to
the
catherine
gymnasium
although
his
father
doubted
whether
he
could
afford
the
money
bartels
had
gone
there
before
him
and
they
read
the
higher
mathematics
gauss
also
devoted
much
of
his
time
to
acquiring
the
ancient
and
modern
languages
from
there
he
passed
to
the
carolinean
college
in
the
spring
of
shortly
before
this
the
duke
charles
william
ferdinand
of
braunschweig
among
others
had
noticed
his
talents
and
promised
to
further
his
career
in
he
published
his
first
papers
and
in
the
autumn
of
he
entered
the
university
of
gottingen
at
this
time
he
was
hesitating
between
the
pursuit
of
philology
or
mathematics
but
his
studies
became
more
and
more
of
the
latter
order
he
discovered
the
division
of
the
circle
a
problem
published
in
his
disquisitiones
arithmeticae
and
henceforth
elected
for
mathematics
the
method
of
least
squares
was
also
discovered
during
his
first
term
on
arriving
home
the
duke
received
him
in
the
friendliest
manner
and
he
was
promoted
to
helmstedt
where
with
the
assistance
of
his
patron
he
published
his
disquisitiones
on
january
piazzi
the
astronomer
of
palermo
discovered
a
small
planet
which
he
named
ceres
ferdinandia
and
communicated
the
news
by
post
to
bode
of
berlin
and
oriani
of
milan
the
letter
was
days
in
going
and
the
planet
by
that
time
was
lost
in
the
glory
of
the
sun
by
a
method
of
his
own
published
in
his
theoria
motus
corporum
coelestium
gauss
calculated
the
orbit
of
this
planet
and
showed
that
it
moved
between
mars
and
jupiter
the
planet
after
eluding
the
search
of
several
astronomers
was
ultimately
found
again
by
zach
on
december
and
on
january
the
ellipse
of
gauss
was
found
to
coincide
with
its
orbit
this
feat
drew
the
attention
of
the
hanoverian
government
and
of
olbers
the
astronomer
to
the
young
mathematician
but
some
time
elapsed
before
he
was
fitted
with
a
suitable
appointment
the
battle
of
austerlitz
had
brought
the
country
into
danger
and
the
duke
of
braunschweig
was
entrusted
with
a
mission
from
berlin
to
the
court
of
petersburg
the
fame
of
gauss
had
travelled
there
but
the
duke
resisted
all
attempts
to
bring
or
entice
him
to
the
university
of
that
place
on
his
return
home
however
he
raised
the
salary
of
gauss
at
the
beginning
of
october
the
armies
of
napoleon
were
moving
towards
the
saale
and
ere
the
middle
of
the
month
the
battles
of
auerstadt
and
jena
were
fought
and
lost
duke
charles
ferdinand
was
mortally
wounded
and
taken
back
to
braunschweig
a
deputation
waited
on
the
offended
emperor
at
halle
and
begged
him
to
allow
the
aged
duke
to
die
in
his
own
house
they
were
brutally
denied
by
the
emperor
and
returned
to
braunschweig
to
try
and
save
the
unhappy
duke
from
imprisonment
one
evening
in
the
late
autumn
gauss
who
lived
in
the
steinweg
or
causeway
saw
an
invalid
carriage
drive
slowly
out
of
the
castle
garden
towards
the
wendenthor
it
contained
the
wounded
duke
on
his
way
to
altona
where
he
died
on
november
in
a
small
house
at
ottensen
will
take

wrote
zach
to
gauss
in
his
great
name
shall
also
be
written
on
the
firmament
for
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
death
of
the
duke
gauss
continued
in
braunschweig
but
his
small
allowance
and
the
absence
of
scientific
company
made
a
change
desirable
through
olbers
and
heeren
he
received
a
call
to
the
directorate
of
gottingen
university
in
and
at
once
accepted
it
he
took
a
house
near
the
chemical
laboratory
to
which
he
brought
his
wife
and
family
the
building
of
the
observatory
delayed
for
want
of
funds
was
finished
in
and
a
year
or
two
later
it
was
fully
equipped
with
instruments
in
gauss
measured
a
degree
of
latitude
between
gottingen
and
altona
in
geodesy
he
invented
the
heliotrope
by
which
the
sunlight
reflected
from
a
mirror
is
used
as
a
sight
for
the
theodolite
at
a
great
distance
through
professor
william
weber
he
was
introduced
to
the
science
of
and
they
devised
an
experimental
telegraph
chiefly
for
sending
time
signals
between
the
observatory
and
the
physical
cabinet
of
the
university
the
mirror
receiving
instrument
employed
was
the
heavy
prototype
of
the
delicate
reflecting
galvanometer
of
sir
william
thomson
in
messages
were
transmitted
through
the
line
in
presence
of
the
duke
of
cambridge
but
it
was
hardly
fitted
for
general
use
in
he
published
an
absolute
system
of
magnetic
measurements
on
july
the
jubilee
of
gauss
was
celebrated
at
the
university
the
famous
jacobi
miller
of
cambridge
and
others
taking
part
in
it
after
this
he
completed
several
works
already
begun
read
a
great
deal
of
german
and
foreign
literature
and
visited
the
museum
daily
between
eleven
and

complained
of
his
declining
health
and
on
the
morning
of

william
edward
weber
was
born
on
october
at

where
his
father
michael

was
professor
of
theology
william
was
the
second
of
three
brothers
all
of
whom
were
distinguished
by
an
aptitude
for
the
study
of
science
after
the
dissolution
of
the
university
of
wittenberg
his
father
was
transferred
to
halle
in
william
had
received
his
first
lessons
from
his
father
but
was
now
sent
to
the
orphan
asylum
and
grammar
school
at
halle
after
that
he
entered
the
university
and
devoted
himself
to
natural
philosophy
he
distinguished
himself
so
much
in
his
classes
and
by
original
work
that
after
taking
his
degree
of
doctor
and
becoming
a
he
was
appointed
professor
extraordinary
of
natural
philosophy
at
halle
in
on
the
recommendation
of
gauss
he
was
called
to
gottingen
as
professor
of
physics
although
but
years
of
age
his
lectures
were
interesting
instructive
and
suggestive
weber
thought
that
in
order
to
thoroughly
understand
physics
and
apply
it
to
daily
life
mere
lectures
though
illustrated
by
experiments
were
insufficient
and
he
encouraged
his
students
to
experiment
themselves
free
of
charge
in
the
college
laboratory
as
a
student
of
twenty
years
he
with
his
brother
ernest
henry
weber
professor
of
anatomy
at
leipsic
had
written
a
book
on
the
theory
and
fluidity
which
brought
its
authors
a
considerable
reputation
acoustics
was
a
favourite
science
of
his
and
he
published
numerous
papers
upon
it
in
poggendorff
annalen
schweigger
jahrbucher
fur
chemie
und
physic
and
the
musical
journal
caecilia
the
of
walking
in
was
another
study
undertaken
in
conjunction
with
his
younger
brother
edward
weber
these
important
investigations
were
published
between
the
years
and
displaced
by
the
hanoverian
government
for
his
liberal
opinions
in
politics
weber
travelled
for
a
time
visiting
england
among
other
countries
and
became
professor
of
physics
in
leipsic
from
to
when
he
was
reinstalled
at
gottingen
one
of
his
most
important
works
was
the
atlas
des
erdmagnetismus
a
series
of
magnetic
maps
and
it
was
chiefly
through
his
efforts
that
magnetic
observatories
were
instituted
he
studied
magnetism
with
gauss
and
in
published
his
proportional
measures
containing
a
system
of
absolute

for
electric
currents
which
forms
the

he
returned

on
furlough
owing
to

afterwards
relinquished
this
connection
in
he
studied
anatomy

in

acquiring
great
skill
at
modelling
dissections
in
coloured
wax
in
the
summer
of
while
touring
in
switzerland
with
his
parents
he
visited
heidelberg
and
was
induced
by
professor
tiedeman
director
of
the
anatomical
institute
to
return
there
and
continue
his
wax
modelling
he
lodged
at
stockstrasse
in
the
house
of
a
brewer
and
modelled
in
a
room
nearly
opposite
some
of
his
models
have
been
preserved
in
the
anatomical
museum
at
heidelberg
in
march
hearing
accidentally
from
hoppner
a
son
of
lord
byron
friend
that
the
professor
of
natural
philosophy
in
the
university
geheime
hofrath
moncke
had
a
model
of
baron
schilling
telegraph
cooke
went
to
see
it
on
march
in
the
professor
lecture
room
an
upper
storey
of
an
old
convent
of
dominicans
where
he
also
lived
struck
by
what
he
witnessed
he
abandoned
his
medical
studies
and
resolved
to
apply
all
his
energies
to
the
introduction
of
the
telegraph
within
three
weeks
he
had
made
partly
at
heidelberg
and
partly
at
frankfort
his
first
galvanometer
or
needle
telegraph
it
consisted
of
three
magnetic
needles
surrounded
by
multiplying
coils
and
actuated
by
three
separate
circuits
of
six
wires
the
movements
of
the
needles
under
the
action
of
the
currents
produced
different
signals
corresponding
to
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
completing
the
model
of
my
original
plan
he
wrote
to
his
mother
on
april
on
entirely
fresh
systems
suggested
themselves
and
i
have
at
length
succeeded
in
combining
the
utile
of
each
but
the
mechanism
requires
a
more
delicate
hand
than
mine
to
execute
or
rather
instruments
which
i
do
not
possess
these
i
can
readily
have
made
for
me
in
london
and
by
the
aid
of
a
lathe
i
shall
be
able
to
adapt
the
several
parts
which
i
shall
have
made
by
different
mechanicians
for
secrecy
sake
should
i
succeed
it
may
be
the
means
of
putting
some
hundreds
of
pounds
in
my
pocket
as
it
is
a
subject
on
which
i
was
profoundly
ignorant
until
my
attention
was
casually
attracted
to
it
the
other
day
i
do
not
know
what
others
may
have
done
in
the
same
way
this
can
best
be
learned
in
london
the
systems
referred
to
was
his
telegraph
consisting
of
two
letter
dials
working
synchronously
and
on
which
particular
letters
of
the
message
were
indicated
by
means
of
an
and
detent
before
the
end
of
march
he
invented
the
alarm
in
which
an
attracted
an
armature
of
soft
iron
and
thus
withdrew
a
detent
allowing
the
works
to
strike
the
alarm
this
idea
was
suggested
to
him
on
march
while
reading
mary
somerville
of
the
physical
sciences
in
travelling
from
heidelberg
to
frankfort
cooke
arrived
in
london
on
april
and
wrote
a
pamphlet
setting
forth
his
plans
for
the
establishment
of
an
electric
telegraph
but
it
was
never
published
according
to
his
own
account
he
also
gave
considerable
attention
to
the
escapement
principle
or
step
by
step
movement
afterwards
perfected
by
wheatstone
while
busy
in
preparing
his
apparatus
for
exhibition
part
of
which
was
made
by
a
in
clerkenwell
he
consulted
faraday
about
the
construction
of
the
philosopher
saw
his
apparatus
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
was
perfectly
correct
and
that
the
appears
perfectly
adapted
to
its
intended
uses
nevertheless
he
was
not
very
sanguine
of
making
it
a
commercial
success
telegraph
shall
not
ruin
me
he
wrote
to
his
mother
will
hardly
make
my
fortune
he
was
desirous
of
taking
a
partner
in
the
work
and
went
to
liverpool
in
order
to
meet
some
gentleman
likely
to
forward
his
views
and
endeavoured
to
get
his
instrument
adopted
on
the
incline
of
the
tunnel
at
liverpool
but
it
gave
sixty
signals
and
was
deemed
too
complicated
by
the
directors
soon
after
his
return
to
london
by
the
end
of
april
he
had
two
simpler
instruments
in
working
order
all
these
preparations
had
already
cost
him
nearly
four
hundred
pounds
on
february
cooke
being
dissatisfied
with
an
experiment
on
a
mile
of
wire
consulted
faraday
and
roget
as
to
the
action
of
a
current
on
an
in
circuit
with
a
long
wire
roget
sent
him
to
wheatstone
where
to
his
dismay
he
learned
that
wheatstone
had
been
employed
for
months
on
the
construction
of
a
telegraph
for
practical
purposes
the
end
of
their
conferences
was
that
a
partnership
in
the
undertaking
was
proposed
by
cooke
and
ultimately
accepted
by
wheatstone
the
latter
had
given
cooke
fresh
hopes
of
success
when
he
was
worn
and
discouraged
truth
he
wrote
in
a
letter
after
his
first
interview
with
the
professor
had
given
the
telegraph
up
since
thursday
evening
and
only
sought
proofs
of
my
being
right
to
do
so
ere
announcing
it
to
you
this
day
enquiries
partly
revives
my
hopes
but
i
am
far
from
sanguine
the
scientific
men
know
little
or
nothing
absolute
on
the
subject
wheatstone
is
the
only
man
near
the
mark
it
would
appear
that
the
current
reduced
in
strength
by
its
passage
through
a
long
wire
had
failed
to
excite
his
and
he
was
ignorant
of
the
reason
wheatstone
by
his
knowledge
of
ohm
law
and
the
was
probably
able
to
enlighten
him
it
is
clear
that
cooke
had
made
considerable
progress
with
his
inventions
before
he
met
wheatstone
he
possessed
a
needle
telegraph
like
wheatstone
an
alarm
and
a
chronometric
dial
telegraph
which
at
all
events
are
a
proof
that
he
himself
was
an
inventor
and
that
he
doubtless
bore
a
part
in
the
production
of
the
cooke
and
wheatstone
apparatus
contrary
to
a
statement
of
wheatstone
it
appears
from
a
letter
of
cooke
dated
march
that
wheatstone
acknowledged
the
advantage
of
cooke
apparatus
had
it
worked
his
wheatstone
are
ingenious
but
not
practicable
but
these
conflicting
accounts
are
reconciled
by
the
fact
that
cooke
telegraph
would
not
work
and
wheatstone
told
him
so
because
he
knew
the
magnet
was
not
strong
enough
when
the
current
had
to
traverse
a
long
circuit
wheatstone
subsequently
investigated
the
conditions
necessary
to
obtain
effects
at
a
long
distance
had
he
studied
the
paper
of
professor
henry
in
silliman
journal
for
january
he
would
have
learned
that
in
a
long
circuit
the
had
to
be
wound
with
a
long
and
fine
wire
in
order
to
be
effective
as
the
cooke
and
wheatstone
apparatus
became
perfected
cooke
was
busy
with
schemes
for
its
introduction
their
joint
patent
is
dated
june
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
cooke
was
introduced
to
robert
stephenson
and
by
his
address
and
energy
got
leave
to
try
the
invention
from
euston
to
camden
town
along
the
line
of
the
london
and
birmingham
railway
cooke
suspended
some
thirteen
miles
of
copper
in
a
shed
at
the
euston
terminus
and
exhibited
his
needle
and
his
chronometric
telegraph
in
action
to
the
directors
one
morning
but
the
official
trial
took
place
as
we
have
already
described
in
the
life
of
wheatstone
the
telegraph
was
soon
adopted
on
the
great
western
railway
and
also
on
the
blackwall
railway
in
three
years
later
it
was
tried
on
a
government
line
from
london
to
portsmouth
in
the
electric
telegraph
company
the
pioneer
association
of
its
kind
was
started
and
cooke
became
a
director
wheatstone
and
he
obtained
a
considerable
sum
for
the
use
of
their
apparatus
in
her
majesty
conferred
the
honour
of
knighthood
on
the
and
in
cooke
was
granted
a
civil
list
pension
of
a
year
his
latter
years
were
spent
in
seclusion
and
he
died
at
farnham
on
june
outside
of
telegraphic
circles
his
name
had
become
forgotten
iv
alexander
bain
alexander
bain
was
born
of
humble
parents
in
the
little
town
of
thurso
at
the
extreme
north
of
scotland
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
went
to
hear
a
penny
lecture
on
science
which
according
to
his
own
account
set
him
thinking
and
influenced
his
whole
future
learning
the
art
of
clockmaking
he
went
to
edinburgh
and
subsequently
removed
to
london
where
he
obtained
work
in
clerkenwell
then
famed
for
its
clocks
and
watches
his
first
patent
is
dated
january
and
is
in
the
name
of
john
barwise
chronometer
maker
and
alexander
bain
mechanist
wigmore
street
it
describes
his
electric
clock
in
which
there
is
an
pendulum
and
the
electric
current
is
employed
to
keep
it
going
instead
of
springs
or
weights
he
improved
on
this
idea
in
following
patents
and
also
proposed
to
derive
the
motive
electricity
from
an
battery
by
burying
plates
of
zinc
and
copper
in
the
ground
gauss
and
steinheil
had
priority
in
this
device
which
owing
to
of
the
plates
and
to
drought
is
not
reliable
long
afterwards
jones
of
chester
succeeded
in
regulating
timepieces
from
a
standard
astronomical
clock
by
an
improvement
on
the
method
of
bain
on
december
bain
in
conjunction
with
lieut
thomas
wright
of
percival
street
clerkenwell
patented
means
of
applying
electricity
to
control
railway
engines
by
turning
off
the
steam
marking
time
giving
signals
and
printing
intelligence
at
different
places
he
also
proposed
to
utilise
bodies
of
water
for
a
return
wire
but
the
earlier
experimenters
had
done
so
particularly
steinheil
in
the
most
important
idea
in
the
patent
is
perhaps
his
plan
for
inverting
the
needle
telegraph
of
ampere
wheatstone
and
others
and
instead
of
making
the
signals
by
the
movements
of
a
pivoted
magnetic
needle
under
the
influence
of
an
electrified
coil
obtaining
them
by
suspending
a
movable
coil
traversed
by
the
current
between
the
poles
of
a
fixed
magnet
as
in
the
later
siphon
recorder
of
sir
william
thomson
bain
also
proposed
to
make
the
coil
record
the
message
by
printing
it
in
type
and
he
developed
the
idea
in
a
subsequent
patent
next
year
on
december
he
projected
a
mode
of
measuring
the
speed
of
ships
by
vanes
revolving
in
the
water
and
indicating
their
speed
on
deck
by
means
of
the
current
in
the
same
specification
he
described
a
way
of
sounding
the
sea
by
an
electric
circuit
of
wires
and
of
giving
an
alarm
when
the
temperature
of
a
ship
hold
reached
a
certain
degree
the
last
device
is
the
in
which
the
mercury
of
a
thermometer
completes
an
electric
circuit
when
it
rises
to
a
particular
point
of
the
tube
and
thus
actuates
an
electric
bell
or
other
alarm
on
december
bain
who
was
staying
in
edinburgh
at
that
time
patented
his
greatest
invention
the
chemical
telegraph
which
bears
his
name
he
recognised
that
the
morse
and
other
telegraph
instruments
in
use
were
comparatively
slow
in
speed
owing
to
the
mechanical
inertia
of
the
parts
and
he
saw
that
if
the
signal
currents
were
made
to
pass
through
a
band
of
travelling
paper
soaked
in
a
solution
which
would
decompose
under
their
action
and
leave
a
legible
mark
a
very
high
speed
could
be
obtained
the
chemical
he
employed
to
saturate
the
paper
was
a
solution
of
nitrate
of
ammonia
and
prussiate
of
potash
which
left
a
blue
stain
on
being
decomposed
by
the
current
from
an
iron
contact
or
stylus
the
signals
were
the
short
and
long
or
and
of
the
morse
code
the
speed
of
marking
was
so
great
that
hand
signalling
could
not
keep
up
with
it
and
bain
devised
a
plan
of
automatic
signalling
by
means
of
a
running
band
of
paper
on
which
the
signals
of
the
message
were
represented
by
holes
punched
through
it
obviously
if
this
tape
were
passed
between
the
contact
of
a
signalling
key
the
current
would
merely
flow
when
the
perforations
allowed
the
contacts
of
the
key
to
touch
this
principle
was
afterwards
applied
by
wheatstone
in
the
construction
of
his
automatic
sender
the
chemical
telegraph
was
tried
between
paris
and
lille
before
a
committee
of
the
institute
and
the
legislative
assembly
the
speed
of
signalling
attained
was
words
in
seconds
a
marvellous
advance
on
the
morse
instrument
which
only
gave
about
forty
words
a
minute
in
the
hands
of
edison
the
neglected
method
of
bain
was
seen
by
sir
william
thomson
in
the
centennial
exhibition
philadelphia
recording
at
the
rate
of
words
in
seconds
in
england
the
telegraph
of
bain
was
used
on
the
lines
of
the
old
electric
telegraph
company
to
a
limited
extent
and
in
america
about
the
year
it
was
taken
up
by
the
energetic
henry
and
widely
introduced
but
it
incurred
the
hostility
of
morse
who
obtained
an
injunction
against
it
on
the
slender
ground
that
the
running
paper
and
alphabet
used
were
covered
by
his
patent
by
as
shaffner
tells
us
there
was
only
one
line
in
america
on
which
the
bain
system
was
in
use
namely
that
from
boston
to
montreal
since
those
days
of
rivalry
the
apparatus
has
never
become
general
and
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
why
considering
its
very
high
speed
the
chemical
telegraph
has
not
become
a
greater
favourite
in
bain
devised
an
automatic
method
of
playing
on
wind
instruments
by
moving
a
band
of
perforated
paper
which
controlled
the
supply
of
air
to
the
pipes
and
likewise
proposed
to
play
a
number
of
keyed
instruments
at
a
distance
by
means
of
the
electric
current
both
of
these
plans
are
still
in
operation
these
and
other
inventions
in
the
space
of
six
years
are
a
striking
testimony
to
the
fertility
of
bain
imagination
at
this
period
but
after
this
extraordinary
outburst
he
seems
to
have
relapsed
into
sloth
and
the
dissipation
of
his
powers
we
have
been
told
and
indeed
it
is
plain
that
he
received
a
considerable
sum
for
one
or
other
of
his
inventions
probably
the
chemical
telegraph
but
while
he
could
rise
from
the
ranks
and
brave
adversity
by
dint
of
ingenuity
and
labour
it
would
seem
that
his
sanguine
temperament
was
for
prosperity
he
went
to
america
and
what
with
litigation
unfortunate
investment
and
perhaps
extravagance
the
fortune
he
had
made
was
rapidly
diminished
whether
his
inventive
genius
was
exhausted
or
he
became
disheartened
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
but
he
never
flourished
again
the
rise
in
his
condition
may
be
inferred
from
the
preamble
to
his
patent
for
electric
telegraphs
and
clocks
dated
may
wherein
he
describes
himself
as
and
living
at
beevor
lodge
hammersmith
after
an
ephemeral
appearance
in
this
character
he
sank
once
more
into
poverty
if
not
even
wretchedness
moved
by
his
unhappy
circumstances
sir
william
thomson
the
late
sir
william
siemens
latimer
clark
and
others
obtained
from
gladstone
in
the
early
part
of
a
pension
for
him
under
the
civil
list
of
a
year
but
the
beneficiary
lived
in
such
obscurity
that
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
his
lodging
could
be
discovered
and
his
better
fortune
take
effect
the
royal
society
had
previously
made
him
a
gift
of
in
his
latter
years
while
he
resided
in
glasgow
his
health
failed
and
he
was
struck
with
paralysis
in
the
legs
the
massive
forehead
once
pregnant
with
the
fire
of
genius
grew
dull
and
slow
of
thought
while
the
sturdy
frame
of
iron
hardihood
became
a
tottering
wreck
he
was
removed
to
the
home
for
incurables
at
broomhill
kirkintilloch
where
he
died
on
january
and
was
interred
in
the
old
aisle
cemetery
he
was
a
widower
and
had
two
children
but
they
were
said
to
be
abroad
at
the
time
the
son
in
america
and
the
daughter
on
the
continent
several
of
bain
earlier
patents
are
taken
out
in
two
names
but
this
was
perhaps
owing
to
his
poverty
compelling
him
to
take
a
partner
if
these
and
other
inventions
were
substantially
his
own
and
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
received
more
help
from
others
than
is
usual
with
inventors
we
must
allow
that
bain
was
a
mechanical
genius
of
the
first
order
a
born
inventor
considering
the
early
date
of
his
achievements
and
his
lack
of
education
or
pecuniary
resource
we
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
strength
fecundity
and
prescience
of
his
creative
faculty
it
has
been
said
that
he
came
before
his
time
but
had
he
been
more
fortunate
in
other
respects
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
would
have
worked
out
and
introduced
all
or
nearly
all
his
inventions
and
probably
some
others
his
misfortunes
and
sorrows
are
so
typical
of
the
inventor
that
we
would
fain
learn
more
about
his
life
but
beyond
a
few
facts
in
a
little
pamphlet
published
by
himself
we
believe
there
is
little
to
be
gathered
a
veil
of
silence
has
fallen
alike
upon
his
triumphs
his
errors
and
his
miseries

eldest
brother
of
the
same
distinguished
family
of
which
our
own
sir
william
siemens
was
a
member
ernst
like
his
brother
william
was
born
at
lenthe
near
hanover
on
december
he
was
educated
at
the
college
of
lubeck
in
maine
and
entered
the
prussian
artillery
service
as
a
volunteer
he
pursued
his
scientific
studies
at
the
artillery
and
engineers
school
in
berlin
and
in
obtained
an
commission
physics
and
chemistry
were
his
favourite
studies
and
his
original
researches
in
resulted
in
a
prussian
patent
in
the
following
year
he
in
conjunction
with
his
brother
william
took
out
another
patent
for
a
differential
regulator
in
he
was
appointed
to
a
post
in
the
artillery
workshops
in
berlin
where
he
learned
telegraphy
and
in
patented
a
dial
and
printing
telegraph
which
is
still
in
use
in
germany
in
he
was
made
a
member
of
a
commission
organised
in
berlin
to
introduce
electric
telegraphs
in
place
of
the
optical
ones
hitherto
employed
in
prussia
and
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
commission
to
adopt
underground
telegraph
lines
for
the
insulation
of
the
wires
he
recommended
which
was
then
becoming
known
as
an
insulator
in
the
following
year
he
constructed
a
machine
for
covering
copper
wire
with
the
melted
gum
by
means
of
pressure
and
this
machine
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
now
used
for
the
purpose
in
cable
factories
in
when
the
war
broke
out
with
denmark
he
was
sent
to
kiel
where
together
with
his
professor
himly
he
laid
the
first
submarine
mines
fired
by
electricity
and
thus
protected
the
town
of
kiel
from
the
advance
of
the
enemies
fleet
of
late
years
the
german
government
has
laid
a
great
network
of
underground
lines
between
the
various
towns
and
fortresses
of
the
empire
preferring
them
to
overhead
lines
as
being
less
liable
to
interruption
from
mischief
accident
hostile
soldiers
or
stress
of
weather
the
first
of
such
lines
was
however
laid
as
long
ago
as
by
werner
siemens
who
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
deposited
a
subterranean
cable
between
berlin
and
next
year
a
second
cable
was
laid
from
the
capital
to
cologne
and
verviers
in
the
subject
of
our
memoir
had
along
with
halske
founded
a
telegraph
factory
and
he
now
left
the
army
to
give
himself
up
to
scientific
work
and
the
development
of
his
business
this
factory
prospered
well
and
is
still
the
chief
continental
works
of
the
kind
the
new
departure
made
by
werner
siemens
was
fortunate
for
electrical
science
and
from
then
till
now
a
number
of
remarkable
inventions
have
proceeded
from
his
laboratory
the
following
are
the
more
notable
advances
made
in
october
a
machine
for
the
measurement
of
small
intervals
of
time
and
the
speed
of
electricity
by
means
of
electric
sparks
and
its
application
in
for
measuring
the
speed
of
the
electric
current
in
overland
lines
in
january
a
paper
on
telegraph
lines
and
apparatus
in
which
the
theory
of
the
charge
in
insulated
wires
as
well
as
methods
and
formula
for
the
localising
of
faults
in
underground
wires
were
first
established
in
the
firm
erected
the
first
automatic
fire
telegraphs
in
berlin
and
in
the
same
year
werner
siemens
wrote
a
treatise
on
the
experience
gained
with
the
underground
lines
of
the
prussian
telegraph
system
the
difficulty
of
communicating
through
long
underground
lines
led
him
to
the
invention
of
automatic
translation
which
was
afterwards
improved
upon
by
steinheil
and
in
he
furnished
the
line
with
automatic
writers
the
messages
were
punched
in
a
paper
band
by
means
of
the
siemens
lever
punching
apparatus
and
then
automatically
transmitted
in
a
clockwork
instrument
in
the
discovery
contemporaneous
with
that
of
frischen
of
simultaneous
transmission
of
messages
in
opposite
directions
and
multiplex
transmission
of
messages
by
means
of
apparatus
the
system
which
is
now
employed
both
on
land
lines
and
submarine
cables
had
been
suggested
however
before
this
by
zetsche
gintl
and
others
in
he
invented
the
siemens
dial
instrument
giving
alternate
currents
from
this
apparatus
originated
the
siemens
armature
and
from
the
receiver
was
developed
the
polarised
relay
with
which
the
working
of
submarine
and
other
lines
could
be
effected
with
alternate
currents
and
in
the
same
year
during
the
laying
of
the
cagliari
to
bona
cable
he
constructed
and
first
applied
the
dynamometer
which
has
become
of
such
importance
in
the
operations
of
cable
laying
in
he
investigated
the
induction
and
retardation
of
currents
in
insulated
wires
a
phenomenon
which
he
had
observed
in
and
communicated
an
account
of
it
to
the
french
academy
of
sciences
these
researches
he
developed
mathematically
faraday
theory
of
molecular
induction
and
thereby
paved
the
way
in
great
measure
for
its
general
acceptance
his
ozone
apparatus
his
telegraph
instrument
working
with
alternate
currents
and
his
instrument
for
translating
on
and
automatically
discharging
submarine
cables
also
belong
to
the
year
the
latter
instruments
were
applied
to
the
sardinia
malta
and
corfu
cable
in
he
constructed
an
electric
log
he
discovered
that
a
dielectric
is
heated
by
induction
he
introduced
the
well
known
siemens
mercury
unit
and
many
improvements
in
the
manufacture
of
resistance
coils
he
also
investigated
the
law
of
change
of
resistance
in
wires
by
heating
and
published
several
formulae
and
methods
for
testing
resistances
and
determining
by
measuring
resistances
these
methods
were
adopted
by
the
electricians
of
the
government
service
in
prussia
and
by
siemens
brothers
in
london
during
the
manufacture
of
the
malta
to
alexandria
cable
which
was
we
believe
the
first
long
cable
subjected
to
a
system
of
continuous
tests
he
showed
that
the
electrical
resistance
of
molten
alloys
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
resistances
of
the
separate
metals
and
that
latent
heat
increases
the
specific
resistance
of
metals
in
a
greater
degree
than
free
heat
in
he
made
researches
on
the
heating
of
the
sides
of
a
leyden
jar
by
the
electrical
discharge
in
he
published
the
general
theory
of
machines
and
the
principle
of
accumulating
the
magnetic
effect
a
principle
which
however
had
been
contemporaneously
discovered
by
varley
and
described
in
a
patent
some
years
before
by
soren
hjorth
a
danish
inventor
hjorth
patent
is
to
be
found
in
the
british
patent
office
library
and
until
lately
it
was
thought
that
he
was
the
first
and
true
inventor
of
the
proper
but
we
understand
there
is
a
prior
inventor
still
though
we
have
not
seen
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
statement
the
reversibility
of
the
dynamo
was
enunciated
by
werner
siemens
in
but
it
was
not
experimentally
demonstrated
on
any
practical
scale
until
when
hippolite
fontaine
succeeded
in
pumping
water
at
the
vienna
international
exhibition
by
the
aid
of
two
dynamos
connected
in
circuit
one
the
generator
deriving
motion
from
a
hydraulic
engine
and
in
turn
setting
in
motion
the
receiving
dynamo
which
worked
the
pump
professor
clerk
maxwell
thought
this
discovery
the
greatest
of
the
century
and
the
remark
has
been
repeated
more
than
once
but
it
is
a
remark
which
derives
its
chief
importance
from
the
man
who
made
it
and
its
credentials
from
the
paradoxical
surprise
it
causes
the
discovery
in
question
is
certainly
fraught
with
very
great
consequences
to
the
mechanical
world
but
in
itself
it
is
no
discovery
of
importance
and
naturally
follows
from
faraday
far
greater
and
more
original
discovery
of
generation
in
siemens
published
a
treatise
on
the
laying
and
testing
of
submarine
cables
in
and
he
investigated
the
action
of
light
on
crystalline
selenium
and
in
he
studied
the
action
of
the
telephone
the
recent
work
of
siemens
has
been
to
improve
the
pneumatic
railway
railway
signalling
electric
lamps
dynamos
and
electric
railways
the
electric
railway
at
berlin
in
and
paris
in
was
the
beginning
of
electric
locomotion
a
subject
of
great
importance
and
destined
in
all
probability
to
very
wide
extension
in
the
immediate
future
siemens
has
received
many
honours
from
learned
societies
at
home
and
abroad
and
a
title
equivalent
to
knighthood
from
the
german
government

clark
was
born
at

probably
acquired
his
scientific
bent
while
engaged
at
a
manufacturing
chemist
business
in
dublin
on
the
outbreak
of
the
railway
mania
in
he
took
to
surveying
and
through
his
brother
edwin
clark
became
assistant
engineer
to
the
late
robert
stephenson
on
the
britannia
bridge
while
thus
employed
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
ricardo
founder
of
the
electric
telegraph
company
and
joined
that
company
as
an
engineer
in
he
rose
to
be
chief
engineer
in
and
held
the
post
till
when
he
entered
into
a
partnership
with
charles
bright
prior
to
this
he
had
made
several
original
researches
in
he
found
that
the
retardation
of
current
on
insulated
wires
was
independent
of
the
strength
of
current
and
his
experiments
formed
the
subject
of
a
friday
evening
lecture
by
faraday
at
the
royal
institution
a
sufficient
mark
of
their
importance
in
he
introduced
the
pneumatic
dispatch
into
london
and
in
he
patented
his
insulator
in
he
and
mr

produced
the
material
known
as

which
is
so
valuable
for
protecting
submarine

in
clark
was
appointed
engineer
to
the
atlantic

tried
to
lay
an
cable
in
in

was
nearly
lost
in
the
shipwreck
of

clark
became
the
head

enough
has
been
given
to
show
that

and
even
brilliant

clark
has
applied
himself
in
divers
directions

never
applied
himself
in

there
is
always
some
practical
result
to
show
which
will
be
useful
to
others
in

he
published
a
description
of

communicated
a
lengthy
paper
on
the
new
standard
of
electromotive

his
father
was
a
peer
of
france
one
of
the
old
nobility
and
a
general
of

he
possessed
a
model
farm
near
cherbourg
and
had
set
his
heart
on
training
his
son
to
carry
on
this
pet
project
but
young
du
moncel
under
the
combined
influence
of
a
desire
for
travel
a
love
of
archaeology
and
a
rare
talent
for
drawing
went
off
to
greece
and
filled
his
portfolio
with
views
of
the
parthenon
and
many
other
pictures
of
that
classic
region
his
father
avenged
himself
by
declining
to
send
him
any
money
but
the
artist
sold
his
sketches
and
relied
solely
on
his
pencil
on
returning
to
paris
he
supported
himself
by
his
art
but
at
the
same
time
gratified
his
taste
for
science
in
a
discursive
manner
a

belonging
to
a
noble
and
distinguished
family
had
plighted
her
troth
with
him
and
as
we
have
been
told
descended
one
day
from
her
carriage
and
wedded
the
man
of
her
heart
in
the
humble
room
of
a
flat
not
far
from
the
grand
opera
house
they
were
a
devoted
pair
and
madame
du
moncel
played
the
double
part
of
a
faithful
and
inspiring
genius
heart
and
soul
she
encouraged
her
husband
to
distinguish
himself
by
his
talents
and
energy
and
even
assisted
him
in
his
labours
about
he
began
to
occupy
himself
almost
exclusively
with
electrical
science
his
most
conspicuous
discovery
is
that
pressure
diminishes
the
resistance
of
contact
between
two
conductors
a
fact
which
clerac
in
utilised
in
the
construction
of
a
variable
resistance
from
carbon
such
as
plumbage
by
compressing
it
with
an
adjustable
screw
it
is
also
the
foundation
of

illness
on
february
his
devoted

was
recovering
from
a
long

his
family
were
quakers
and
in
early
life
he
was
apprenticed
to
a
carpenter
but
showed
a
taste
for
chemistry
and
at
the
age
of
he
went
to
oberlin
college
where
he
studied
for
five
years
at
the
age
of
thirty
he
turned
his
attention
to
electricity
and
invented
a
relay
which
adapted
itself
to
the
varying
insulation
of
the
telegraph
line
he
was
then
led
to
devise
several
forms
of
automatic
repeaters
