introduction
the
two
volumes
here
published
contain
but
a
small
selection
from
the
numerous
writings
of
acton
on
a
variety
of
topics
which
are
to
be
found
scattered
through
many
periodicals
of
the
last
the
result
here
displayed
is
therefore
not
complete
a
further
selection
of
nearly
equal
quantity
might
be
made
and
still
much
that
is
valuable
in
work
would
remain
buried
here
for
instance
we
have
extracted
nothing
from
the
and
acton
gifts
as
a
remain
without
illustration
yet
they
were
remarkable
rarely
did
he
show
to
better
advantage
than
in
the
articles
and
reviews
he
wrote
in
that
rival
of
the
from
the
two
bound
volumes
of
that
single
weekly
there
might
be
made
a
selection
which
would
be
of
high
interest
to
all
who
cared
to
learn
what
was
passing
in
the
minds
of
the
most
acute
and
enlightened
members
of
the
roman
communion
at
one
of
the
most
critical
epochs
in
the
history
of
the
papacy
but
what
could
never
be
reproduced
is
the
general
impression
of
acton
many
contributions
to
the
the
and
and
the
british
perhaps
none
of
his
longer
and
more
ceremonious
writings
can
give
to
the
reader
so
vivid
a
sense
at
once
of
the
range
of
acton
erudition
and
the
strength
of
his
critical
faculty
as
does
the
perusal
of
these
short
notices
any
one
who
wished
to
understand
the
personality
of
acton
could
not
do
better
than
take
the
published
bibliography
and
read
a
few
of
the
articles
on
contemporary
literature
furnished
by
him
to
the
three
reviews
in
no
other
way
could
the
reader
so
clearly
realise
the
complexity
of
his
mind
or
the
vast
number
of
subjects
which
he
could
touch
with
the
hand
of
a
master
in
a
single
number
there
are
such
notices
his
writing
before
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
shows
an
intimate
and
detailed
knowledge
of
documents
and
authorities
which
with
most
students
is
the
hard
won
and
hardly
won
achievement
of
a
lifetime
of
labour
he
always
writes
as
the
student
never
as
the
even
the
memorable
phrases
which
give
point
to
his
briefest
articles
are
judicial
not
journalistic
yet
he
treats
of
matters
which
range
from
the
dawn
of
history
through
the
ancient
empires
down
to
subjects
so
essentially
modern
as
the
vast
literature
of
revolutionary
france
or
the
leaders
of
the
romantic
movement
which
replaced
it
in
all
these
writings
of
acton
those
qualities
manifest
themselves
which
only
grew
stronger
with
time
and
gave
him
a
distinct
and
unique
place
among
his
contemporaries
here
is
the
same
austere
love
of
truth
the
same
resolve
to
dig
to
the
of
fact
and
to
exhaust
all
sources
of
possible
illumination
the
same
breadth
of
view
and
intensity
of
inquiring
ardour
which
stimulated
his
studies
and
limited
his
productive
power
above
all
there
is
the
same
unwavering
faith
in
principles
as
affording
the
only
criterion
of
judgment
amid
the
welter
of
human
passions
political
manoeuvring
and
ecclesiastical
intrigue
but
this
is
not
all
we
note
the
same
value
for
great
books
as
the
source
of
wisdom
combined
with
the
same
enthusiasm
for
immediate
justice
which
made
acton
the
despair
of
the
mere
academic
student
an
enigma
among
men
of
the
world
and
a
to
the
politician
of
the
clubs
beyond
this
we
find
that
certainty
and
decision
of
judgment
that
crisp
concentration
of
phrase
that
grave
and
deliberate
irony
and
that
mastery
of
subtlety
allusion
and
wit
which
make
his
interpretation
an
adventure
and
his
judgment
a
sword
a
few
instances
may
be
given
in
criticising
a
professor
of
history
famous
in
every
way
rather
than
as
a
student
acton
says
his
lectures
are
indeed
not
entirely
unhistorical
for
he
has
borrowed
quite
discriminatingly
from
tocqueville
of
another
writer
he
says
that
ideas
if
they
occur
to
him
he
rejects
like
temptations
to
sin
of
ranke
thinking
perhaps
also
of
himself
he
declares
that
his
intimate
knowledge
of
all
the
contemporary
history
of
europe
is
a
merit
not
suited
to
his
insular
readers
of
a
partisan
french
writer
under
louis
napoleon
he
says
that
he
will
have
a
fair
grievance
if
he
fails
to
obtain
from
a
discriminating
government
some
acknowledgment
of
the
services
which
mere
historical
science
will
find
it
hard
to
appreciate
of
laurent
he
says
that
sometimes
it
even
happens
that
his
information
is
not
and
there
are
some
original
authorities
with
which
he
is
evidently
familiar
the
ardour
of
his
opinions
so
different
from
those
which
have
usually
distorted
history
gives
an
interest
even
to
his
grossest
errors
buckle
if
he
had
been
able
to
distinguish
a
good
book
from
a
bad
one
would
have
been
a
tolerable
imitation
of
m
laurent
perhaps
however
the
most
characteristic
of
these
forgotten
judgments
is
the
description
of
lord
liverpool
and
the
class
which
supported
him
not
even
disraeli
painting
the
leader
of
that
party
which
he
was
destined
so
strangely
to
educate
could
equal
the
austere
and
accurate
irony
with
which
acton
writing
as
a
student
not
as
a
novelist
sums
up
the
characteristics
of
the
class
of
his
birth
lord
liverpool
governed
england
in
the
greatest
crisis
of
the
war
and
for
twelve
troubled
years
of
peace
chosen
not
by
the
nation
but
by
the
owners
of
the
land
the
english
gentry
were
well
content
with
an
order
of
things
by
which
for
a
century
and
a
quarter
they
had
enjoyed
so
much
prosperity
and
power
desiring
no
change
they
wished
for
no
ideas
they
sympathised
with
the
complacent
respectability
of
lord
liverpool
character
and
knew
how
to
value
the
safe
sterility
of
his
mind
he
distanced
statesmen
like
grenville
wellesley
and
canning
not
in
spite
of
his
inferiority
but
by
reason
of
it
his
mediocrity
was
his
merit
the
secret
of
his
policy
was
that
he
had
none
for
six
years
his
administration
outdid
the
holy
alliance
for
five
years
it
led
the
liberal
movement
throughout
the
world
the
prime
minister
hardly
knew
the
difference
he
it
was
who
forced
canning
on
the
king
in
the
same
spirit
he
wished
his
government
to
include
men
who
were
in
favour
of
the
catholic
claims
and
men
who
were
opposed
to
them
his
career
exemplifies
not
the
accidental
combination
but
the
natural
affinity
between
the
love
of
conservatism
and
the
fear
of
ideas
the
longer
essays
republished
in
these
volumes
exhibit
in
most
of
its
characteristics
a
personality
which
even
those
who
disagreed
with
his
views
must
allow
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
remarkable
products
of
european
culture
in
the
nineteenth
century
they
will
show
in
some
degree
how
acton
mind
developed
in
the
three
chief
periods
of
his
activity
something
of
the
influences
which
moulded
it
a
great
deal
of
its
preferences
and
its
antipathies
and
nearly
all
its
directing
ideals
during
the
first
period
roughly
to
be
dated
from
to
he
was
hopefully
striving
under
the
influence
of
döllinger
his
teacher
from
the
age
of
seventeen
to
educate
his
in
breadth
and
sympathy
and
to
place
before
his
countrymen
ideals
of
right
in
politics
which
were
to
him
bound
up
with
the
catholic
faith
the
combination
of
scientific
inquiry
with
true
rules
of
political
justice
he
claimed
in
a
letter
to
döllinger
as
the
aim
of
the
and
foreign
the
result
is
to
be
seen
in
a
quarterly
forgotten
like
all
such
quarterlies
but
far
surpassing
alike
in
knowledge
range
and
certainty
any
of
the
other
quarterlies
political
or
ecclesiastical
or
specialist
which
the
nineteenth
century
produced
there
is
indeed
no
general
periodical
which
comes
near
to
it
for
thoroughness
of
erudition
and
strength
of
thought
if
not
for
brilliance
and
ease
while
it
touches
on
topics
contemporary
and
political
in
a
way
impossible
to
any
specialist
journal
a
comparison
with
the
in
the
religious
sphere
with
the
in
the
political
will
show
how
in
all
the
weightier
matters
of
learning
and
thought
the
and
indeed
the
was
their
superior
while
it
displayed
a
cosmopolitan
interest
foreign
to
most
english
journals
we
need
not
recapitulate
the
story
so
admirably
told
already
by
doctor
gasquet
of
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
various
journalistic
enterprises
with
which
acton
was
connected
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
however
the
time
may
be
regarded
as
that
of
youth
and
hope
next
came
what
must
be
termed
the
fighting
period
when
he
stood
forth
as
the
leader
among
laymen
of
the
party
opposed
to
that
insolent
and
aggressive
faction
which
achieved
its
imagined
triumph
at
the
vatican
council
this
period
which
may
perhaps
be
dated
from
the
issue
of
the
syllabus
by
pius
ix
in
may
be
considered
to
close
with
the
reply
to
gladstone
pamphlet
on
the
vatican
decrees
and
with
the
attempt
of
the
famous
cardinal
in
whose
mind
history
was
identified
with
heresy
to
drive
from
the
roman
communion
its
most
illustrious
english
layman
part
of
this
story
tells
itself
in
the
letters
published
by
the
abbot
gasquet
and
more
will
be
known
when
those
to
döllinger
are
given
to
the
world
we
may
date
the
third
period
of
acton
life
from
the
failure
of
manning
attempt
or
indeed
a
little
earlier
he
had
now
given
up
all
attempt
to
contend
against
the
dominant
influence
of
the
court
of
rome
though
feeling
that
loyalty
to
the
church
of
his
baptism
as
a
living
body
was
independent
of
the
disastrous
policy
of
its
hierarchy
during
this
time
he
was
occupied
with
the
great
unrealised
project
of
the
history
of
liberty
or
in
movements
of
english
politics
and
in
the
usual
avocations
of
a
student
in
the
earlier
part
of
this
period
are
to
be
placed
some
of
the
best
things
that
acton
ever
wrote
such
as
the
lectures
on
liberty
here
republished
it
is
characterised
by
his
discovery
in
the
eighties
that
döllinger
and
he
were
divided
on
the
question
of
the
severity
of
condemnation
to
be
passed
on
persecutors
and
their
approvers
acton
found
to
his
dismay
that
döllinger
like
creighton
was
willing
to
accept
pleas
in
arrest
of
judgment
or
at
least
mitigation
of
sentence
which
the
layman
sterner
code
repudiated
finding
that
he
had
misunderstood
his
master
acton
was
for
a
time
profoundly
discouraged
declared
himself
isolated
and
surrendered
the
outlook
of
literary
work
as
vain
he
found
in
fact
that
in
ecclesiastical
as
in
general
politics
he
was
alone
however
much
he
might
sympathise
with
others
up
to
a
certain
point
on
the
other
hand
these
years
witnessed
a
gradual
mellowing
of
his
judgment
in
regard
to
the
prospects
of
the
church
and
its
capacity
to
absorb
and
interpret
in
a
harmless
sense
the
dogma
against
whose
promulgation
he
had
fought
so
eagerly
it
might
also
be
correct
to
say
that
the
english
element
in
acton
came
out
most
strongly
in
this
period
closing
as
it
did
with
the
cambridge
professorship
and
including
the
development
of
the
friendship
between
himself
and
gladstone
we
have
spoken
both
of
the
english
element
in
acton
and
of
his
european
importance
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
is
possible
to
present
or
understand
him
there
were
in
him
strains
of
many
races
on
his
father
side
he
was
an
english
country
squire
but
foreign
residence
and
the
neapolitan
court
had
largely
affected
the
family
in
addition
to
that
flavour
of
cosmopolitan
culture
which
belongs
to
the
more
highly
placed
englishmen
of
the
roman
communion
on
his
mother
side
he
was
a
member
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
greatest
families
in
germany
which
was
only
not
princely
the
dalbergs
moreover
had
intermarried
with
an
italian
family
the
brignoli
trained
first
at
oscott
under
wiseman
and
afterwards
at
munich
under
döllinger
in
whose
house
he
lived
acton
by
education
as
well
as
birth
was
a
cosmopolitan
while
his
marriage
with
the
family
of
introduced
a
further
strain
of
bavarian
influence
into
his
life
his
mother
second
marriage
with
lord
granville
brought
him
into
connection
with
the
dominant
influences
of
the
great
whig
houses
for
a
brief
period
like
many
another
county
magnate
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
but
he
never
became
accustomed
to
its
atmosphere
for
a
longer
time
he
lived
at
his
house
in
shropshire
and
was
a
stately
and
sympathetic
host
though
without
much
taste
for
the
avocations
of
country
life
his
english
birth
and
whig
surroundings
were
largely
responsible
for
that
intense
constitutionalism
which
was
to
him
a
religion
and
in
regard
both
to
ecclesiastical
and
civil
politics
formed
his
guiding
criterion
this
explains
his
detestation
of
all
forms
of
absolutism
on
the
one
hand
and
what
he
always
called
the
revolution
on
the
other
it
was
not
however
the
english
strain
that
was
most
obvious
in
acton
but
the
german
it
was
natural
that
he
should
become
fired
under
döllinger
influence
with
the
ideals
of
continental
scholarship
and
exact
and
minute
investigation
he
had
a
good
deal
of
the
massive
solidity
of
the
german
intellect
he
liked
as
in
the
letter
to
a
german
bishop
to
make
his
judgment
appear
as
the
culmination
of
so
much
weighty
evidence
that
it
seemed
to
speak
for
itself
he
had
too
a
little
of
the
german
habit
of
breaking
a
butterfly
upon
a
wheel
and
at
times
he
makes
reading
difficult
by
a
more
than
teutonic
allusiveness
it
was
not
easy
for
acton
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
public
is
often
ignorant
of
even
the
names
of
distinguished
scholars
and
that
a
european
reputation
is
sometimes
confined
to
the
readers
of
specialist
publications
the
italian
strain
in
acton
is
apparent
in
another
quality
which
is
perhaps
his
one
point
of
kinship
with
machiavelli
the
absence
of
hesitation
from
his
thought
and
of
mystery
from
his
writing
subtle
and
ironic
as
his
style
is
charged
with
allusion
and
weighted
with
passion
it
is
yet
entirely
devoid
both
of
german
sentiment
and
english
vagueness
there
was
no
haze
in
his
mind
he
judges
but
does
not
paint
pictures
it
may
have
been
this
absence
of
in
his
vein
of
thought
and
of
in
his
imagination
that
made
manning
an
intelligent
however
hostile
critic
speak
of
the
ruthless
talk
of
undergraduates
but
however
much
or
little
be
allowed
to
the
diverse
strains
of
hereditary
influence
or
outward
circumstances
the
interest
of
acton
to
the
student
lies
in
his
intense
individuality
that
austerity
of
moral
judgment
that
sense
of
the
greatness
of
human
affairs
and
of
the
vast
issues
that
lie
in
action
and
in
thought
was
no
product
of
outside
influences
and
went
beyond
what
he
had
learnt
from
his
master
döllinger
to
treat
politics
as
a
game
to
play
with
truth
or
make
it
subservient
to
any
cause
other
than
itself
to
take
trivial
views
was
to
acton
as
deep
a
crime
as
to
waste
in
pleasure
or
futility
the
hours
so
brief
given
for
salvation
of
the
soul
would
have
seemed
to
baxter
or
bunyan
indeed
there
was
an
element
of
puritan
severity
in
his
attitude
towards
statesmen
both
ecclesiastical
and
civil
he
was
no
light
of
a
casual
creed
but
had
a
sense
of
reality
more
like
dante
than
many
moderns
this
perhaps
it
was
that
drew
him
ever
closer
to
gladstone
while
it
made
the
house
of
commons
and
the
daily
doings
of
politicians
uncongenial
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
learned
too
well
the
secret
of
intellectual
detachment
early
in
his
life
his
shrewd
and
kindly
stepfather
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
danger
of
losing
influence
by
a
too
unrestrained
desire
to
escape
worshipping
the
idols
of
the
marketplace
there
are
it
is
true
not
wanting
signs
that
his
view
of
the
true
relations
of
states
and
churches
may
become
one
day
more
dominant
for
it
appears
as
though
once
more
the
earlier
middle
ages
will
be
justified
and
religious
bodies
become
the
guardians
of
freedom
even
in
the
political
sphere
still
a
successful
career
in
public
life
could
hardly
be
predicted
for
one
who
felt
at
the
beginning
that
i
agree
with
nobody
and
nobody
agrees
with
me
and
towards
the
close
admitted
that
he
never
had
any
contemporaries
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
questioned
whether
in
the
chief
of
his
tasks
he
failed
so
greatly
as
at
first
appeared
if
he
did
not
prevent
infallibility
being
decreed
the
action
of
the
party
of
strossmayer
and
hefele
assuredly
prevented
the
form
of
the
decree
being
so
dangerous
as
they
at
first
feared
we
can
only
hazard
a
guess
that
the
mild
and
minimising
terms
of
the
dogma
especially
as
they
have
since
been
interpreted
were
in
reality
no
triumph
to
veuillot
and
the
jesuits
in
later
life
acton
seems
to
have
felt
that
they
need
not
have
the
dangerous
consequences
both
in
regard
to
historical
judgments
or
political
principles
which
he
had
feared
from
the
registered
victory
of
ultramontane
reaction
however
this
may
be
acton
whole
career
is
evidence
of
his
detachment
of
mind
and
entire
independence
even
of
his
closest
associates
it
was
a
matter
to
him
not
of
taste
but
of
principle
what
mainly
marked
him
out
among
men
was
the
intense
reality
of
his
faith
this
gave
to
all
his
studies
their
practical
tone
he
had
none
of
the
pedant
contempt
for
ordinary
life
none
of
the
contempt
for
action
as
a
little
vulgar
and
no
desire
to
make
of
intellectual
pursuits
an
end
in
themselves
his
scholarship
was
to
him
as
practical
as
his
politics
and
his
politics
as
ethical
as
his
faith
thus
his
whole
life
was
a
unity
all
his
various
interests
were
inspired
by
one
unconquered
resolve
the
aim
of
securing
universally
alike
in
church
and
in
state
the
recognition
of
the
paramountcy
of
principles
over
interests
of
liberty
over
tyranny
of
truth
over
all
forms
of
evasion
or
equivocation
his
ideal
in
the
political
world
was
as
he
said
that
of
securing
to
every
individual
or
association
of
human
life
and
to
prevent
any
institution
however
holy
its
aims
acquiring
more
to
understand
the
ardour
of
his
efforts
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
the
world
into
which
he
was
born
and
the
crises
intellectual
religious
and
political
which
he
lived
to
witness
and
sometimes
to
influence
born
in
the
early
days
of
the
july
monarchy
when
reform
in
england
was
a
novelty
and
catholic
freedom
a
boon
acton
as
he
grew
to
manhood
in
munich
and
in
england
had
presented
to
his
regard
a
series
of
scenes
well
calculated
to
arouse
a
thoughtful
mind
to
consideration
of
the
deepest
problems
both
of
politics
and
religion
what
must
have
been
the
long
long
thoughts
of
a
youth
naturally
reflective
and
acutely
observant
as
he
witnessed
the
of
the
old
order
in
and
the
years
that
followed
in
the
most
impressionable
age
of
life
he
was
driven
to
contemplate
a
europe
in
solution
the
crash
of
the
kingdoms
the
pope
a
liberal
an
exile
and
a
reactionary
the
principle
of
nationality
claiming
to
supersede
all
vested
rights
and
to
absorb
and
complete
the
work
of
even
socialism
for
once
striving
to
reduce
theory
to
practice
till
there
came
the
saviour
of
society
with
the
and
a
new
era
of
authority
and
despotism
this
was
the
outward
aspect
in
the
world
of
thought
he
looked
upon
a
period
of
moral
and
intellectual
anarchy
philosopher
had
succeeded
philosopher
critic
had
followed
critic
strauss
and
baur
were
names
to
conjure
with
and
hegel
was
still
unforgotten
in
the
land
of
his
birth
materialistic
science
was
in
the
very
heyday
of
its
parvenu
and
tawdry
intolerance
and
historical
knowledge
in
the
splendid
dawn
of
that
new
world
of
knowledge
of
which
ranke
was
the
columbus
everywhere
faith
was
shaken
and
except
for
a
few
resolute
and
unconquered
spirits
it
seemed
as
though
its
defence
were
left
to
a
class
of
men
who
thought
the
only
refuge
of
religion
was
in
obscurity
the
sole
bulwark
of
order
was
tyranny
and
the
one
support
of
eternal
truth
plausible
and
convenient
fiction
what
wonder
then
that
the
pupil
of
döllinger
should
exhaust
the
intellectual
and
moral
energies
of
a
lifetime
in
preaching
to
those
who
direct
the
affairs
of
men
the
paramount
supremacy
of
principle
the
course
of
the
plebiscitary
empire
and
that
gradual
campaign
in
the
united
states
by
which
the
will
of
the
majority
became
identified
with
that
necessity
which
knows
no
law
contributed
further
to
educate
his
sense
of
right
in
politics
and
to
augment
the
distrust
of
power
natural
to
a
pupil
of
the
great
whigs
of
burke
of
montesquieu
of
madame
de
staël
on
the
other
hand
as
a
pupil
of
döllinger
his
religious
faith
was
deeper
than
could
be
touched
by
the
recognition
of
facts
of
which
too
many
were
notorious
to
make
it
even
good
policy
to
deny
the
rest
and
he
demanded
with
passion
that
history
should
set
the
follies
and
the
crimes
of
ecclesiastical
authority
in
no
better
light
than
those
of
civil
we
can
not
understand
acton
aright
if
we
do
not
remember
that
he
was
an
english
roman
catholic
to
whom
the
penal
laws
and
the
exploitation
of
ireland
were
a
burning
injustice
they
were
in
his
view
as
foul
a
blot
on
the
protestant
establishment
and
the
whig
aristocracy
as
was
the
bartholomew
medal
on
the
memory
of
gregory
or
the
murder
of
the
duc
on
the
genius
of
napoleon
or
the
burning
of
servetus
on
the
sanctity
of
calvin
or
the
permission
of
bigamy
on
the
character
of
luther
or
the
september
massacres
on
danton
two
other
tendencies
dominant
in
germany
tendencies
which
had
and
have
a
great
power
in
the
minds
of
scholars
yet
to
acton
both
as
a
christian
and
a
man
seemed
corrupting
compelled
him
to
a
search
for
principles
which
might
deliver
him
from
slavery
alike
to
traditions
and
to
fashion
from
the
historian
vice
of
condoning
whatever
has
got
itself
allowed
to
exist
and
from
the
politician
habit
of
mere
opportunist
acquiescence
in
popular
standards
first
of
these
is
the
famous
maxim
of
schiller
ist
das
which
as
commonly
interpreted
definitely
identifies
success
with
right
and
is
based
consciously
or
unconsciously
on
a
pantheistic
philosophy
this
tendency
especially
when
envisaged
by
an
age
passing
through
revolutionary
nationalism
back
to
ideals
and
is
clearly
subversive
of
any
system
of
public
law
or
morality
and
indeed
is
generally
recognised
as
such
nowadays
even
by
its
adherents
the
second
tendency
against
which
acton
moral
sense
revolted
had
arisen
out
of
the
laudable
determination
of
historians
to
be
sympathetic
towards
men
of
distant
ages
and
of
alien
modes
of
thought
with
the
romantic
movement
the
early
nineteenth
century
placed
a
check
upon
the
habit
of
despising
mediæval
ideals
which
had
been
increasing
from
the
days
of
the
renaissance
and
had
culminated
in
voltaire
instead
of
this
there
arose
a
sentiment
of
admiration
for
the
past
while
the
general
growth
of
historical
methods
of
thinking
supplied
a
sense
of
the
relativity
of
moral
principles
and
led
to
a
desire
to
condone
if
not
to
commend
the
crimes
of
other
ages
it
became
almost
a
trick
of
style
to
talk
of
judging
men
by
the
standard
of
their
day
and
to
allege
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
excuse
for
the
albigensian
crusade
or
the
burning
of
hus
acton
felt
that
this
was
to
destroy
the
very
bases
of
moral
judgment
and
to
open
the
way
to
a
boundless
scepticism
anxious
as
he
was
to
uphold
the
doctrine
of
growth
in
theology
he
allowed
nothing
for
it
in
the
realm
of
morals
at
any
rate
in
the
christian
era
since
the
thirteenth
century
he
demanded
a
code
of
moral
judgment
independent
of
place
and
time
and
not
merely
relative
to
a
particular
civilisation
he
also
demanded
that
it
should
be
independent
of
religion
his
reverence
for
scholars
knew
no
limits
of
creed
or
church
and
he
desired
some
body
of
rules
which
all
might
recognise
independently
of
such
historical
phenomena
as
religious
institutions
at
a
time
when
such
varied
and
contradictory
opinions
both
within
and
without
the
limits
of
christian
belief
were
supported
by
some
of
the
most
powerful
minds
and
distinguished
investigators
it
seemed
idle
to
look
for
any
basis
of
agreement
beyond
some
simple
moral
principles
but
he
thought
that
all
men
might
agree
in
admitting
the
sanctity
of
human
life
and
judging
accordingly
every
man
or
system
which
needlessly
sacrificed
it
it
is
this
preaching
in
season
and
out
of
season
against
the
reality
of
wickedness
and
against
every
interference
with
the
conscience
that
is
the
real
inspiration
both
of
acton
life
and
of
his
writings
it
is
related
of
frederick
robertson
of
brighton
that
during
one
of
his
periods
of
intellectual
perplexity
he
found
that
the
only
rope
to
hold
fast
by
was
the
conviction
it
must
be
right
to
do
right
the
whole
of
lord
acton
career
might
be
summed
up
in
a
counterphrase
it
must
be
wrong
to
do
wrong
it
was
this
conviction
universally
and
unwaveringly
applied
and
combined
with
an
unalterable
faith
in
christ
which
gave
unity
to
all
his
efforts
sustained
him
in
his
struggle
with
ecclesiastical
authority
accounted
for
all
his
sympathies
and
accentuated
his
antipathies
while
it
at
once
expanded
and
limited
his
interests
it
is
this
that
made
his
personality
so
much
greater
a
gift
to
the
world
than
any
book
which
he
might
have
written
had
he
cared
less
for
the
end
and
more
for
the
process
of
historical
knowledge
he
was
interested
in
knowledge
that
it
might
diminish
prejudice
and
break
down
barriers
to
a
world
in
which
the
very
bases
of
civilisation
seemed
to
be
dissolving
he
preached
the
need
of
directing
ideals
artistic
interests
were
not
strong
in
him
and
the
decadent
pursuit
of
culture
as
a
mere
luxury
had
no
stronger
enemy
intellectual
activity
apart
from
moral
purpose
was
anathema
to
acton
he
has
been
censured
for
bidding
the
student
of
his
hundred
best
books
to
steel
his
mind
against
the
charm
of
literary
beauty
and
style
yet
he
was
right
his
list
of
books
was
expressly
framed
to
be
a
guide
not
a
pleasure
it
was
intended
to
supply
the
place
of
university
direction
to
those
who
could
not
afford
a
college
life
and
it
throws
light
upon
the
various
strands
that
mingled
in
acton
and
the
historical
scientific
and
political
influences
which
formed
his
mind
he
felt
the
danger
that
lurks
in
the
charm
of
literary
beauty
and
style
for
he
had
both
as
a
writer
and
a
reader
a
strong
taste
for
rhetoric
and
he
knew
how
young
minds
are
apt
to
be
enchained
rather
by
the
persuasive
spell
of
the
manner
than
the
living
thought
beneath
it
above
all
he
detested
the
modern
journalistic
craze
for
novelty
and
despised
the
shallowness
which
rates
cleverness
above
wisdom
in
the
same
way
his
eulogy
of
george
eliot
has
been
censured
far
more
than
it
has
been
understood
it
was
not
as
an
artist
superior
to
all
others
that
he
praised
the
author
of
and
the
translator
of
strauss
it
was
because
she
supplied
in
her
own
person
the
solution
of
the
problem
nearest
to
his
heart
and
redeemed
so
far
as
teaching
went
infidelity
in
religion
from
immorality
in
ethics
it
was
above
all
as
a
constructive
teacher
of
morals
that
he
admired
george
eliot
who
might
in
his
view
save
a
daily
increasing
scepticism
from
its
worst
dangers
and
preserve
morals
which
a
future
age
of
faith
might
once
more
inspire
with
religious
ideals
here
was
a
writer
at
the
summit
of
modern
culture
saturated
with
materialistic
science
a
convinced
and
unchanging
atheist
who
in
spite
of
this
proclaimed
in
all
her
work
that
moral
law
is
binding
and
upheld
a
code
of
ethics
christian
in
content
though
not
in
foundation
in
the
same
way
his
admiration
for
gladstone
is
to
be
explained
it
was
not
his
successes
so
much
as
his
failures
that
attracted
acton
and
above
all
his
refusal
to
admit
that
nations
in
their
dealings
with
one
another
are
subject
to
no
law
but
that
of
greed
doubtless
one
who
gave
himself
no
credit
for
practical
aptitude
in
public
affairs
admired
a
man
who
had
gifts
that
were
not
his
own
but
what
acton
most
admired
was
what
many
condemned
it
was
because
he
was
not
like
lord
palmerston
because
bismarck
disliked
him
because
he
gave
back
the
transvaal
to
the
boers
and
tried
to
restore
ireland
to
its
people
because
his
love
of
liberty
never
weaned
him
from
loyalty
to
the
crown
and
his
politics
were
part
of
his
religion
that
acton
used
of
gladstone
language
rarely
used
and
still
more
rarely
applicable
to
any
statesman
for
this
very
reason
his
belief
that
political
differences
do
while
religious
differences
do
not
imply
a
different
morality
he
censured
so
severely
the
generous
eulogy
of
disraeli
just
as
in
döllinger
case
he
blamed
the
praise
of
dupanloup
for
acton
was
intolerant
of
all
leniency
towards
methods
and
individuals
whom
he
thought
immoral
he
could
give
quarter
to
the
infidel
more
easily
than
to
the
jesuit
we
may
of
course
deny
that
acton
was
right
but
few
intelligent
observers
can
dispute
the
accuracy
of
his
diagnosis
or
deny
that
more
than
anything
else
the
disease
of
western
civilisation
is
a
general
lack
of
directing
ideals
other
than
those
which
are
included
in
the
gospel
of
commercialism
it
may
surely
be
further
admitted
that
even
intellectual
activity
has
too
much
of
triviality
about
it
that
if
people
despise
the
schoolmen
it
is
rather
owing
to
their
virtues
than
their
defects
because
impressionism
has
taken
the
place
of
thought
and
brilliancy
that
of
labour
on
the
other
hand
acton
dream
of
ethical
agreement
apart
from
religion
seems
further
off
from
realisation
than
ever
acton
however
wrote
for
a
world
which
breathed
in
the
atmosphere
created
by
kant
his
position
was
something
as
follows
after
the
discovery
of
facts
a
matter
of
honesty
and
industry
independent
of
any
opinions
history
needs
a
criterion
of
judgment
by
which
it
may
appraise
men
actions
this
criterion
can
not
be
afforded
by
religion
for
religion
is
one
part
of
the
historic
process
of
which
we
are
tracing
the
flow
the
principles
on
which
all
can
combine
are
the
inviolable
sanctity
of
human
life
and
the
unalterable
principle
of
even
justice
and
toleration
wherever
these
are
violated
our
course
is
clear
neither
custom
nor
convenience
neither
distance
of
time
nor
difference
of
culture
may
excuse
or
even
limit
our
condemnation
murder
is
always
murder
whether
it
be
committed
by
populace
or
patricians
by
councils
or
kings
or
popes
had
they
had
their
dues
paolo
sarpi
would
have
been
in
newgate
and
george
would
have
died
at
tyburn
the
unbending
severity
of
his
judgment
which
is
sometimes
carried
to
an
excess
almost
ludicrous
is
further
explained
by
another
element
in
his
experience
in
his
letters
to
döllinger
and
others
he
more
than
once
relates
how
in
early
life
he
had
sought
guidance
in
the
difficult
historical
and
ethical
questions
which
beset
the
history
of
the
papacy
from
many
of
the
most
eminent
ultramontanes
later
on
he
was
able
to
test
their
answers
in
the
light
of
his
constant
study
of
original
authorities
and
his
careful
investigation
of
archives
he
found
that
the
answers
given
him
had
been
at
the
best
but
plausible
evasions
the
letters
make
it
clear
that
the
harshness
with
which
acton
always
regarded
ultramontanes
was
due
to
that
bitter
feeling
which
arises
in
any
reflecting
mind
on
the
discovery
that
it
has
been
put
off
with
explanations
that
did
not
explain
or
left
in
ignorance
of
material
facts
liberalism
we
must
remember
was
a
religion
to
acton
liberalism
as
he
understood
it
by
no
means
always
what
goes
by
the
name
his
conviction
that
ultramontane
theories
lead
to
immoral
politics
prompted
his
ecclesiastical
antipathies
his
anger
was
aroused
not
by
any
feeling
that
papal
infallibility
was
a
theological
error
but
by
the
belief
that
it
enshrined
in
the
church
monarchical
autocracy
which
could
never
maintain
itself
apart
from
crime
committed
or
condoned
it
was
not
intellectual
error
but
moral
obliquity
that
was
to
him
here
as
everywhere
the
enemy
he
could
tolerate
unbelief
he
could
not
tolerate
sin
machiavelli
represented
to
him
the
worst
of
political
principles
because
in
the
name
of
the
public
weal
he
destroyed
the
conscience
yet
he
left
a
loophole
in
private
life
for
religion
and
a
sinning
statesman
might
one
day
become
converted
but
when
the
same
principles
are
applied
as
they
have
been
applied
by
the
jesuit
organisers
of
ultramontane
reaction
also
on
occasion
by
protestants
majorem
dei
it
is
clear
that
the
soul
is
corrupted
at
its
highest
point
and
the
very
means
of
serving
god
are
made
the
occasion
of
denying
him
because
for
acton
there
was
no
comparison
between
goodness
and
knowledge
and
because
life
was
to
him
more
than
thought
because
the
passion
of
his
life
was
to
secure
for
all
souls
the
freedom
to
live
as
god
would
have
them
live
he
hated
in
the
church
the
politics
of
ultramontanism
and
in
the
state
the
principles
of
machiavelli
in
the
same
way
he
denied
the
legitimacy
of
every
form
of
government
every
economic
wrong
every
party
creed
which
sacrificed
to
the
pleasures
or
the
safety
of
the
few
the
righteousness
and
salvation
of
the
many
his
one
belief
was
the
right
of
every
man
not
to
have
but
to
be
his
best
this
fact
gives
the
key
to
what
seems
to
many
an
unsolved
contradiction
that
the
man
who
said
what
he
did
say
and
fought
as
he
had
fought
should
yet
declare
in
private
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
doubt
any
single
dogma
of
his
church
and
assert
in
public
that
communion
with
it
was
dearer
than
life
itself
yet
all
the
evidence
both
of
his
writings
and
his
most
intimate
associates
confirms
this
view
his
opposition
to
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
was
ethical
and
political
rather
than
theological
as
he
wrote
to
döllinger
the
evil
lay
deeper
and
vaticanism
was
but
the
last
triumph
of
a
policy
that
was
centuries
old
unless
he
were
turned
out
of
her
he
would
see
no
more
reason
to
leave
the
church
of
his
baptism
on
account
of
the
vatican
decrees
than
on
account
of
those
of
the
lateran
council
to
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
he
had
no
hostility
and
could
not
understand
condemnation
of
it
or
reconcile
it
with
his
previous
utterances
he
had
great
sympathy
with
the
position
of
liberal
high
anglicans
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
that
he
ever
desired
to
join
the
english
church
even
with
the
old
catholic
movement
he
had
no
sympathy
and
dissuaded
his
friends
from
joining
it
all
forms
of
gallicanism
were
distasteful
to
acton
and
he
looked
to
the
future
for
the
victory
of
his
ideas
his
position
in
the
roman
church
symbolises
in
an
acute
form
what
may
be
called
the
soul
tragedy
of
the
whole
nineteenth
century
but
acton
had
not
the
smallest
inclination
to
follow
either
gavazzi
or
lamennais
it
was
in
truth
the
unwavering
loyalty
of
his
churchmanship
and
his
historical
sense
that
enabled
him
to
attack
with
such
vehemence
evils
which
he
believed
to
be
accidental
and
temporary
even
though
they
might
have
endured
for
a
millennium
long
searching
of
the
vista
of
history
preserved
acton
from
the
common
danger
of
confusing
the
eternal
with
what
is
merely
lengthy
to
such
a
mind
as
his
it
no
more
occurred
to
leave
the
church
because
he
disapproved
some
of
its
official
procedure
than
it
would
to
an
englishman
to
surrender
his
nationality
when
his
political
opponents
came
into
office
he
distinguished
as
he
said
froschammer
ought
to
have
done
between
the
authorities
and
the
authority
of
the
church
he
had
a
strong
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
development
and
felt
that
it
would
prove
impossible
in
the
long
run
to
bind
the
christian
community
to
any
explanation
of
the
faith
which
should
have
a
or
immoral
tendency
he
left
it
to
time
and
the
common
conscience
to
clear
the
dogma
from
association
with
dangerous
political
tendencies
for
his
loyalty
to
the
institution
was
too
deep
to
be
affected
by
his
dislike
of
the
in
power
he
not
only
did
not
desire
to
leave
the
church
but
took
pains
to
make
his
confession
and
receive
absolution
immediately
after
his
letters
appeared
in
the
it
must
also
be
stated
that
so
far
from
approving
gladstone
attack
on
vaticanism
he
did
his
utmost
to
prevent
its
publication
which
he
regarded
as
neither
fair
nor
wise
it
is
true
that
acton
whole
tendency
was
individualistic
and
his
inner
respect
for
mere
authority
apart
from
knowledge
and
judgment
was
doubtless
small
but
here
we
must
remember
what
he
said
once
of
the
political
sphere
that
neither
liberty
nor
authority
is
conceivable
except
in
an
ordered
society
and
that
they
are
both
relative
to
conditions
remote
alike
from
anarchy
and
tyranny
doubtless
he
leaned
away
from
those
in
power
and
probably
felt
of
manning
as
strongly
as
the
latter
wrote
of
him
yet
his
individualism
was
always
active
within
the
religious
society
and
never
contemplated
itself
as
outside
he
showed
no
sympathy
for
any
form
of
protestantism
except
the
purely
political
side
of
the
independents
and
other
sects
which
have
promoted
liberty
of
conscience
acton
position
as
a
churchman
is
made
clearer
by
a
view
of
his
politics
at
once
an
admirer
and
an
adviser
of
gladstone
he
probably
helped
more
than
any
other
single
friend
to
make
his
leader
a
home
ruler
yet
he
was
anything
but
a
modern
radical
for
liberty
was
his
goddess
not
equality
and
he
dreaded
any
single
power
in
a
state
whether
it
was
the
king
or
parliament
or
people
neither
popes
nor
princes
not
even
protestant
persecutors
did
acton
condemn
more
deeply
than
the
crimes
of
majorities
and
the
fury
of
uncontrolled
democracy
it
was
not
the
rule
of
one
or
many
that
was
his
ideal
but
a
balance
of
powers
that
might
preserve
freedom
and
keep
every
kind
of
authority
subject
to
law
for
as
he
said
liberty
is
not
a
means
to
a
higher
end
it
is
itself
the
highest
political
end
his
preference
was
therefore
not
for
any
sovereign
one
or
number
such
as
formed
the
ideal
of
rousseau
or
the
absolutists
but
for
a
monarchy
of
the
english
type
with
due
representation
to
the
aristocratic
and
propertied
classes
as
well
as
adequate
power
to
the
people
he
did
not
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
numbers
and
had
no
sympathy
with
the
cry
populi
vox
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
strongly
that
the
stake
in
the
country
argument
really
applied
with
fullest
force
to
the
poor
for
while
political
error
means
mere
discomfort
to
the
rich
it
means
to
the
poor
the
loss
of
all
that
makes
life
noble
and
even
of
life
itself
as
he
said
in
one
of
his
already
published
letters
the
men
who
pay
wages
ought
not
to
be
the
political
masters
of
those
who
earn
them
for
laws
should
be
adapted
to
those
who
have
the
heaviest
stake
in
the
country
for
whom
misgovernment
means
not
mortified
pride
or
stinted
luxury
but
want
and
pain
and
degradation
and
risk
to
their
own
lives
and
to
their
children
souls
while
he
felt
the
dangers
of
rousseau
doctrine
of
equality
declaring
that
in
the
end
it
would
be
destructive
alike
of
liberty
and
religion
he
was
yet
strongly
imbued
with
the
need
of
reconciling
some
of
the
socialists
ideals
with
the
regard
due
to
the
principles
which
he
respected
he
was
anxious
to
promote
the
study
of
roscher
and
the
historical
economists
and
he
seems
to
have
thought
that
by
their
means
some
solution
of
the
great
economic
evils
of
the
modern
world
might
be
found
which
should
avoid
injustice
either
to
the
capitalist
or
the
he
had
a
burning
hatred
of
injustice
and
tyranny
which
made
him
anxious
to
see
the
horrors
of
the
modern
proletariat
system
mitigated
and
destroyed
but
combined
with
this
there
was
a
very
deep
sense
of
the
need
of
acting
on
principles
universally
valid
and
a
distrust
of
any
merely
emotional
enthusiasm
which
might
in
the
future
create
more
evils
than
it
cured
acton
was
in
truth
the
incarnation
of
the
spirit
of
whiggism
although
in
a
very
different
sense
of
the
phrase
from
that
in
which
it
became
the
target
for
the
arrows
of
disraeli
scorn
and
his
mockery
of
the
venetian
constitution
he
was
not
the
conservative
whig
of
the
glorious
revolution
for
to
him
the
memory
of
william
of
orange
might
be
immortal
but
was
certainly
not
pious
yet
it
was
revolution
principles
of
which
he
said
that
they
were
the
great
gift
of
england
to
the
world
by
this
he
meant
the
real
principles
by
which
the
events
of
could
be
philosophically
justified
when
purged
of
all
their
vulgar
and
interested
associations
raised
above
their
connection
with
a
territorial
oligarchy
and
based
on
reasoned
and
universal
ideals
acton
liberalism
was
above
all
things
historical
and
rested
on
a
consciousness
of
the
past
he
knew
very
well
that
the
roots
of
modern
constitutionalism
were
mediæval
and
declared
that
it
was
the
stolid
conservatism
of
the
english
character
which
had
alone
enabled
it
to
preserve
what
other
nations
had
lost
in
the
passion
for
autocracy
that
characterised
the
men
of
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
constitutional
government
was
for
him
the
sole
eternal
truth
in
politics
the
rare
but
the
only
guardian
of
freedom
he
loved
to
trace
the
growth
of
the
principle
of
power
limiting
itself
and
law
triumphant
alike
over
king
aristocracies
and
majorities
and
to
show
how
it
arose
out
of
the
cruel
conflicts
of
the
religious
wars
and
rested
upon
the
achievements
of
constance
and
the
efforts
of
basle
and
how
it
was
influenced
in
expression
by
the
thinkers
of
the
ancient
world
and
the
theologians
of
the
modern
by
the
politics
of
aristotle
by
the
maxims
of
ulpian
and
of
gaius
by
the
theology
of
thomas
and
ockham
and
even
by
suarez
and
molina
what
acton
feared
and
hated
was
the
claim
of
absolutism
to
crush
the
individuality
and
destroy
the
conscience
of
men
it
was
indifferent
to
him
whether
this
claim
was
exercised
by
church
or
state
by
pope
or
council
or
king
or
parliament
he
felt
however
that
it
was
more
dangerous
because
more
absorbing
when
exercised
in
religious
matters
and
thus
condemned
the
protestant
theory
more
deeply
than
the
catholic
permission
of
persecution
he
also
felt
that
monarchy
was
more
easily
checked
than
pure
democracy
and
that
the
risk
of
tyranny
was
greater
in
the
latter
provided
that
freedom
was
left
to
men
to
do
their
duty
acton
was
not
greatly
careful
of
mere
rights
he
had
no
belief
in
the
natural
equality
of
men
and
no
dislike
of
the
subordination
of
classes
on
the
score
of
birth
his
ideal
of
freedom
as
of
the
church
was
in
some
respects
that
of
the
earlier
middle
ages
he
did
not
object
to
serfdom
provided
that
it
safeguarded
the
elementary
rights
of
the
serf
to
serve
god
as
well
as
man
in
the
great
struggle
in
america
he
had
no
sympathy
with
the
north
which
seemed
to
him
to
make
majority
rule
the
only
measure
of
right
and
he
wrote
if
not
in
favour
at
least
in
palliation
of
slavery
it
may
be
doubted
how
far
he
would
have
used
the
same
language
in
later
life
but
his
reasons
were
in
accord
with
all
his
general
views
slavery
might
be
rendered
harmless
by
the
state
and
some
form
of
compulsion
might
be
the
only
way
of
dealing
with
indeed
it
might
be
merely
a
form
of
education
no
more
morally
blameworthy
than
the
legal
disabilities
of
minors
but
the
absolute
state
recognising
no
limits
but
its
own
will
and
bound
by
no
rule
either
of
human
or
divine
law
appeared
to
him
definitely
immoral
acton
political
conscience
was
also
very
broad
on
the
side
technically
called
moral
no
one
had
higher
ideals
of
purity
yet
he
had
little
desire
to
pry
into
the
private
morality
of
kings
or
politicians
it
was
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
principles
that
he
judged
them
he
would
have
condemned
pope
paul
the
fourth
more
than
rodrigo
borgia
and
the
inventor
of
the
dragonnades
more
than
his
he
did
not
view
personal
morality
as
relevant
to
political
judgment
in
this
if
in
nothing
else
he
agreed
with
creighton
his
correspondence
with
the
latter
throws
his
principles
into
the
strongest
light
and
forms
the
best
material
for
a
judgment
for
it
must
we
think
be
admitted
that
he
applied
these
doctrines
with
a
rigidity
which
human
affairs
will
not
admit
and
assumed
a
knowledge
beyond
our
capacity
to
declare
that
no
one
could
be
in
a
state
of
grace
who
praised
carlo
borromeo
because
the
latter
followed
the
evil
principle
of
his
day
in
the
matter
of
persecution
is
not
merely
to
make
the
historian
a
hanging
judge
but
to
ignore
the
great
truth
that
if
crime
is
always
crime
degrees
of
temptation
are
widely
variable
the
fact
is
acton
desire
to
maintain
the
view
that
morality
is
not
ambulatory
led
him
at
times
to
ignore
the
complementary
doctrine
that
it
certainly
develops
and
that
the
difficulties
of
statesmen
or
ecclesiastics
if
they
do
not
excuse
at
least
at
times
explain
their
less
admirable
courses
at
the
very
close
of
his
life
acton
came
to
this
view
himself
in
a
pathetic
conversation
with
his
son
he
lamented
the
harshness
of
some
of
his
judgments
and
hoped
the
example
would
not
be
followed
still
acton
if
he
erred
here
erred
on
the
nobler
side
the
doctrine
of
moral
relativity
had
been
overdone
by
historians
and
the
principles
of
machiavelli
had
become
so
common
a
cry
of
politicians
that
severe
protest
was
necessary
the
ethics
of
nietzsche
are
the
logical
expansion
of
machiavelli
and
his
influence
is
proof
that
in
the
men
can
not
separate
their
international
code
from
their
private
one
we
must
remember
that
acton
lived
in
a
time
when
as
he
said
the
course
of
history
had
been
times
diverted
by
actual
or
attempted
crime
and
when
the
old
ideals
of
liberty
seemed
swallowed
up
by
the
pursuit
of
gain
to
all
those
who
reflect
on
history
or
politics
it
was
a
gain
of
the
highest
order
that
at
the
very
summit
of
historical
scholarship
and
profound
political
knowledge
there
should
be
placed
a
leader
who
erred
on
the
unfashionable
side
who
denied
the
statesmen
claim
to
subject
justice
to
expediency
and
opposed
the
partisan
attempt
to
palter
with
facts
in
the
interest
of
his
creed
it
is
these
principles
which
both
explain
acton
work
as
a
student
and
make
it
so
difficult
to
understand
he
believed
that
as
an
investigator
of
facts
the
historian
must
know
no
passion
save
that
of
a
desire
to
sift
evidence
and
his
notion
of
this
sifting
was
of
the
remorseless
scientific
school
of
germany
which
sometimes
perhaps
expects
more
in
the
way
of
testimony
than
human
life
affords
at
any
rate
acton
demanded
that
the
historian
must
never
misconceive
the
case
of
the
adversaries
of
his
views
or
leave
in
shade
the
faults
of
his
own
side
but
on
the
other
hand
when
he
comes
to
interpret
facts
or
to
trace
their
relation
his
views
and
even
his
temperament
will
affect
the
result
it
is
only
the
barest
outline
that
can
be
quite
objective
in
acton
view
the
historian
as
investigator
is
one
thing
the
historian
as
judge
another
in
an
early
essay
on
döllinger
he
makes
a
distinction
of
this
kind
the
reader
must
bear
it
in
mind
in
considering
acton
own
writing
some
of
the
essays
here
printed
and
still
more
the
lectures
are
anything
but
colourless
they
show
very
distinctly
the
predilections
of
the
writer
and
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
they
should
have
been
written
by
a
defender
of
absolutism
or
even
by
an
tory
what
acton
really
demanded
was
not
the
academic
aloofness
of
the
pedant
who
stands
apart
from
the
strife
of
principles
but
the
honesty
of
purpose
which
throws
itself
into
the
mind
of
one
opponents
and
accounts
for
their
mistakes
giving
their
case
the
best
possible
colouring
for
to
be
sure
of
one
ground
one
must
meet
adversaries
strongest
arguments
and
not
be
content
with
merely
picking
holes
in
his
armour
otherwise
one
own
belief
may
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
next
clever
opponent
the
reader
may
doubt
how
far
acton
succeeded
in
his
own
aim
for
there
was
a
touch
of
intolerance
in
his
hatred
of
absolutism
and
he
believed
himself
to
be
divided
from
his
ecclesiastical
and
political
foes
by
no
mere
intellectual
difference
but
by
a
moral
cleavage
further
his
writing
is
never
his
convictions
were
certitudes
based
on
continual
reading
and
reflection
and
admitting
in
his
mind
of
no
qualification
he
was
eminently
a
victorian
in
his
confidence
that
he
was
right
he
had
none
of
the
invertebrate
tendency
of
mind
which
thinks
it
is
impartial
merely
because
it
is
undecided
and
regards
the
judicial
attitude
as
that
which
refrains
from
judging
acton
was
not
a
doubting
mind
if
he
now
and
then
suspended
his
judgment
it
was
as
an
act
of
deliberate
choice
because
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
matter
could
not
be
decided
not
because
he
could
not
decide
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
he
always
knew
what
he
thought
and
his
language
was
as
exact
an
expression
of
his
meaning
as
he
could
make
it
it
was
true
that
his
subtle
and
intelligence
makes
his
style
now
and
then
like
a
boomerang
as
when
he
says
of
ranke
method
it
is
a
discipline
we
shall
all
do
well
to
adopt
and
also
do
well
to
relinquish
indeed
it
is
hardly
possible
to
read
a
single
essay
without
observing
this
marked
characteristic
he
has
been
called
a
meredith
turned
historian
and
that
there
is
truth
in
this
judgment
any
one
who
sees
at
once
the
difficulty
and
the
suggestiveness
of
his
reviews
can
bear
witness
he
could
hardly
write
the
briefest
note
without
stamping
his
personality
upon
it
and
exhibiting
the
marks
of
a
very
complex
culture
but
the
main
characteristic
of
his
style
is
that
it
represents
the
ideals
of
a
man
to
whom
every
word
was
sacred
its
analogies
are
rather
in
sculpture
than
painting
each
paragraph
almost
every
sentence
is
a
perfectly
chiselled
whole
impressive
by
no
brilliance
or
outside
polish
so
much
as
by
the
inward
intensity
of
which
it
is
the
symbol
thus
his
writing
is
never
fluent
or
easy
but
it
has
a
moral
dignity
rare
and
unfashionable
acton
indeed
was
by
no
means
without
a
gift
of
rhetoric
and
in
the
lecture
on
mexico
here
republished
there
is
ample
evidence
of
a
power
of
handling
words
which
should
impress
a
popular
audience
it
is
in
gravity
of
judgment
and
in
the
light
he
can
draw
from
small
details
that
his
power
is
most
plainly
shown
on
the
other
hand
he
had
a
little
of
the
scholar
love
of
clinging
to
the
bank
and
as
the
notes
to
his
inaugural
show
he
seems
at
times
too
much
disposed
to
use
the
crutches
of
quotation
to
prop
up
positions
which
need
no
such
support
it
was
of
course
the
same
habit
the
desire
not
to
speak
before
he
had
read
everything
that
was
relevant
whether
in
print
or
manuscript
that
hindered
so
severely
his
output
his
projected
of
was
from
the
first
impossible
of
achievement
it
would
have
required
the
intellects
of
napoleon
and
julius
cæsar
combined
and
the
lifetime
of
the
patriarchs
to
have
executed
that
project
as
acton
appears
to
have
planned
it
a
of
beginning
with
the
ancient
world
and
carried
down
to
our
own
day
to
be
based
entirely
upon
original
sources
treating
both
of
the
institutions
which
secured
it
the
persons
who
fought
for
it
and
the
ideas
which
expressed
it
and
taking
note
of
all
that
scholars
had
written
about
every
several
portion
of
the
subject
was
and
is
beyond
the
reach
of
a
single
man
probably
towards
the
close
of
his
life
acton
had
felt
this
the
modern
which
required
the
of
so
many
specialists
was
to
him
really
but
a
fragment
of
this
great
project
two
other
causes
limited
acton
output
towards
the
close
of
the
seventies
he
began
to
suspect
and
eventually
discovered
that
he
and
döllinger
were
not
so
close
together
as
he
had
believed
that
is
to
say
he
found
that
in
regard
to
the
crimes
of
the
past
döllinger
position
was
more
like
that
of
creighton
than
his
own
that
while
he
was
willing
to
say
persecution
was
always
wrong
he
was
not
willing
to
go
so
far
as
acton
in
rejecting
every
kind
of
mitigating
plea
and
with
mediæval
certainty
consigning
the
persecutors
to
perdition
acton
who
had
as
he
thought
learnt
all
this
from
döllinger
was
distressed
at
what
seemed
to
him
the
weakness
and
the
sacerdotal
prejudice
of
his
master
felt
that
he
was
now
indeed
alone
and
for
the
time
surrendered
as
he
said
all
views
of
literary
work
this
was
the
time
when
he
had
been
gathering
materials
for
a
of
the
council
of
that
this
cleavage
coming
when
it
did
had
a
paralysing
effect
on
acton
productive
energy
is
most
probable
for
it
made
him
feel
that
he
was
no
longer
one
of
a
school
and
was
without
sympathy
and
support
in
the
things
that
lay
nearest
his
heart
another
cause
retarded
production
his
determination
to
know
all
about
the
work
of
others
acton
desired
to
be
in
touch
with
university
life
all
over
europe
to
be
aware
if
possible
through
personal
knowledge
of
the
trend
of
investigation
and
thought
of
scholars
working
in
all
the
cognate
branches
of
his
subject
to
keep
up
thoroughly
with
other
people
work
and
do
much
original
writing
of
one
own
is
rarely
possible
at
any
rate
we
may
say
that
the
same
man
could
not
have
produced
the
essay
on
german
schools
of
history
and
written
a
of
his
own
his
life
marks
what
in
an
age
of
minute
specialism
must
always
be
at
once
the
crown
and
the
catastrophe
of
those
who
take
all
knowledge
for
their
province
his
achievement
is
something
different
from
any
book
acton
was
in
fact
himself
those
who
lament
what
he
might
have
written
as
a
historian
would
do
well
to
reflect
on
the
unique
position
which
he
held
in
the
world
of
letters
and
to
ask
themselves
how
far
he
could
have
wielded
the
influence
that
was
his
or
held
the
standard
so
high
had
his
own
achievement
been
greater
men
such
as
acton
and
hort
give
to
the
world
by
their
example
and
disposition
more
than
any
written
volume
could
convey
in
both
cases
a
great
part
of
their
published
writings
has
had
at
least
in
book
form
to
be
posthumous
but
their
influence
on
other
workers
is
incalculable
and
has
not
yet
determined
to
an
age
doubting
on
all
things
and
with
the
moral
basis
of
its
action
largely
undermined
acton
gave
the
spectacle
of
a
career
which
was
as
moving
as
it
was
rare
he
stood
for
a
spirit
of
unwavering
and
even
childlike
faith
united
to
a
passion
for
scientific
inquiry
and
a
scorn
of
consequences
which
at
times
made
him
almost
an
iconoclast
his
whole
life
was
dedicated
to
one
high
end
the
aim
of
preaching
the
need
of
principles
based
on
the
widest
induction
and
the
most
penetrating
thought
as
the
only
refuge
amid
the
storm
and
welter
of
sophistical
philosophies
and
ecclesiastical
intrigues
the
union
of
faith
with
knowledge
and
the
eternal
supremacy
of
righteousness
this
was
the
message
of
acton
to
mankind
it
may
be
thought
that
he
sometimes
exaggerated
his
thesis
that
he
preached
it
out
of
season
that
he
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
being
doctrinaire
and
that
in
fighting
for
it
he
failed
to
utter
the
resources
of
his
vast
learning
enough
however
is
left
to
enable
the
world
to
judge
what
he
was
no
books
ever
do
more
than
that
for
any
man
those
who
are
nice
in
comparisons
may
weigh
against
the
book
lost
the
man
gained
those
who
loved
him
will
know
no
doubt
the
following
document
was
found
among
lord
acton
papers
it
records
in
an
imaginative
form
the
ideals
which
he
set
before
him
perhaps
it
forms
the
most
fitting
conclusion
to
this
introduction
this
day
post
informed
me
of
the
death
of
adrian
who
was
the
best
of
all
men
i
have
known
he
loved
retirement
and
avoided
company
but
you
might
sometimes
meet
him
coming
from
scenes
of
sorrow
silent
and
appalled
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
or
in
the
darkest
corner
of
churches
his
dim
eyes
radiant
with
light
from
another
world
in
youth
he
had
gone
through
much
anxiety
and
contention
but
he
lived
to
be
trusted
and
honoured
at
last
he
dropped
out
of
notice
and
the
memory
of
men
and
that
part
of
his
life
was
the
happiest
years
ago
when
i
saw
much
of
him
most
people
had
not
found
him
out
there
was
something
in
his
best
qualities
themselves
that
baffled
observation
and
fell
short
of
decided
excellence
he
looked
absent
and
preoccupied
as
if
thinking
of
things
he
cared
not
to
speak
of
and
seemed
but
little
interested
in
the
cares
and
events
of
the
day
often
it
was
hard
to
decide
whether
he
had
an
opinion
and
when
he
showed
it
he
would
defend
it
with
more
eagerness
and
obstinacy
than
we
liked
he
did
not
mingle
readily
with
others
or
in
any
common
undertaking
so
that
one
could
not
rely
on
him
socially
or
for
practical
objects
as
he
never
spoke
harshly
of
persons
so
he
seldom
praised
them
warmly
and
there
was
some
apparent
indifference
and
want
of
feeling
ill
success
did
not
depress
but
happy
prospects
did
not
elate
him
and
though
never
impatient
he
was
not
actively
hopeful
facetious
friends
called
him
the
or
facingbothways
because
there
was
no
heartiness
in
his
judgments
and
he
satisfied
nobody
and
said
things
that
were
at
first
sight
grossly
inconsistent
without
attempting
to
reconcile
them
he
was
reserved
about
himself
and
gave
no
explanations
so
that
he
was
constantly
misunderstood
and
there
was
a
sense
of
failure
of
disappointment
of
perplexity
about
him
these
things
struck
me
as
well
as
others
and
at
first
repelled
me
i
could
see
indeed
at
the
same
time
that
his
conduct
was
remarkably
methodical
and
was
guided
at
every
step
by
an
inexhaustible
provision
of
maxims
he
had
meditated
on
every
contingency
in
life
and
was
prepared
with
rules
and
precepts
which
he
never
disobeyed
but
i
doubted
whether
all
this
was
not
artificial
a
contrivance
to
satisfy
the
pride
of
intellect
and
establish
a
cold
superiority
in
time
i
discovered
that
it
was
the
perfection
of
a
developed
character
he
had
disciplined
his
soul
with
such
wisdom
and
energy
as
to
make
it
the
obedient
and
spontaneous
instrument
of
god
will
and
he
moved
in
an
orbit
of
thoughts
beyond
our
reach
it
was
part
of
his
religion
to
live
much
in
the
past
to
realise
every
phase
of
thought
every
crisis
of
controversy
every
stage
of
progress
the
church
has
gone
through
so
that
the
events
and
ideas
of
his
own
day
lost
much
of
their
importance
in
comparison
were
old
friends
with
new
faces
and
impressed
him
less
than
the
multitude
of
those
that
went
before
this
caused
him
to
seem
absent
and
indifferent
rarely
given
to
admire
or
to
expect
he
respected
other
men
opinions
fearing
to
give
pain
or
to
tempt
with
anger
by
contradiction
and
when
forced
to
defend
his
own
he
felt
bound
to
assume
that
every
one
would
look
sincerely
for
the
truth
and
would
gladly
recognise
it
but
he
could
not
easily
enter
into
their
motives
when
they
were
mixed
and
finding
them
generally
mixed
he
avoided
contention
by
holding
much
aloof
being
quite
sincere
he
was
quite
impartial
and
pleaded
with
equal
zeal
for
what
seemed
true
whether
it
was
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
he
would
have
felt
dishonest
if
he
had
unduly
favoured
people
of
his
own
country
his
own
religion
or
his
own
party
or
if
he
had
entertained
the
shadow
of
a
prejudice
against
those
who
were
against
them
and
when
he
was
asked
why
he
did
not
try
to
clear
himself
from
misrepresentation
he
said
that
he
was
silent
both
from
humility
and
pride
at
last
i
understood
that
what
we
had
disliked
in
him
was
his
virtue
itself

is
no

lived

undoubtedly

largely

on

meyrick
also
asserts
it
ever

adherent
of

movement
i
the
history
of
freedom
in
antiquity
liberty
next
to
religion
has
been
the
motive
of
good
deeds
and
the
common
pretext
of
crime
from
the
sowing
of
the
seed
at
athens
two
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
years
ago
until
the
ripened
harvest
was
gathered
by
men
of
our
race
it
is
the
delicate
fruit
of
a
mature
civilisation
and
scarcely
a
century
has
passed
since
nations
that
knew
the
meaning
of
the
term
resolved
to
be
free
in
every
age
its
progress
has
been
beset
by
its
natural
enemies
by
ignorance
and
superstition
by
lust
of
conquest
and
by
love
of
ease
by
the
strong
man
craving
for
power
and
the
poor
man
craving
for
food
during
long
intervals
it
has
been
utterly
arrested
when
nations
were
being
rescued
from
barbarism
and
from
the
grasp
of
strangers
and
when
the
perpetual
struggle
for
existence
depriving
men
of
all
interest
and
understanding
in
politics
has
made
them
eager
to
sell
their
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
and
ignorant
of
the
treasure
they
resigned
at
all
times
sincere
friends
of
freedom
have
been
rare
and
its
triumphs
have
been
due
to
minorities
that
have
prevailed
by
associating
themselves
with
auxiliaries
whose
objects
often
differed
from
their
own
and
this
association
which
is
always
dangerous
has
been
sometimes
disastrous
by
giving
to
opponents
just
grounds
of
opposition
and
by
kindling
dispute
over
the
spoils
in
the
hour
of
success
no
obstacle
has
been
so
constant
or
so
difficult
to
overcome
as
uncertainty
and
confusion
touching
the
nature
of
true
liberty
if
hostile
interests
have
wrought
much
injury
false
ideas
have
wrought
still
more
and
its
advance
is
recorded
in
the
increase
of
knowledge
as
much
as
in
the
improvement
of
laws
the
history
of
institutions
is
often
a
history
of
deception
and
illusions
for
their
virtue
depends
on
the
ideas
that
produce
and
on
the
spirit
that
preserves
them
and
the
form
may
remain
unaltered
when
the
substance
has
passed
away
a
few
familiar
examples
from
modern
politics
will
explain
why
it
is
that
the
burden
of
my
argument
will
lie
outside
the
domain
of
legislation
it
is
often
said
that
our
constitution
attained
its
formal
perfection
in
when
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
passed
yet
charles
ii
succeeded
only
two
years
later
in
making
himself
independent
of
parliament
in
while
the
assembled
at
versailles
the
spanish
cortes
older
than
magna
charta
and
more
venerable
than
our
house
of
commons
were
summoned
after
an
interval
of
generations
but
they
immediately
prayed
the
king
to
abstain
from
consulting
them
and
to
make
his
reforms
of
his
own
wisdom
and
authority
according
to
the
common
opinion
indirect
elections
are
a
safeguard
of
conservatism
but
all
the
assemblies
of
the
french
revolution
issued
from
indirect
elections
a
restricted
suffrage
is
another
reputed
security
for
monarchy
but
the
parliament
of
charles
which
was
returned
by
electors
resisted
and
overthrew
the
throne
while
the
parliament
of
louis
philippe
chosen
by
a
constitution
of
obsequiously
promoted
the
reactionary
policy
of
his
ministers
and
in
the
fatal
division
which
by
rejecting
reform
laid
the
monarchy
in
the
dust
guizot
majority
was
obtained
by
the
votes
of
public
functionaries
an
unpaid
legislature
is
for
obvious
reasons
more
independent
than
most
of
the
continental
legislatures
which
receive
pay
but
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
america
to
send
a
member
as
far
as
from
here
to
constantinople
to
live
for
twelve
months
at
his
own
expense
in
the
dearest
of
capital
cities
legally
and
to
outward
seeming
the
american
president
is
the
successor
of
washington
and
still
enjoys
powers
devised
and
limited
by
the
convention
of
philadelphia
in
reality
the
new
president
differs
from
the
magistrate
imagined
by
the
fathers
of
the
republic
as
widely
as
monarchy
from
democracy
for
he
is
expected
to
make
changes
in
the
public
service
fifty
years
ago
john
quincy
adams
dismissed
only
two
men
the
purchase
of
judicial
appointments
is
manifestly
indefensible
yet
in
the
old
french
monarchy
that
monstrous
practice
created
the
only
corporation
able
to
resist
the
king
official
corruption
which
would
ruin
a
commonwealth
serves
in
russia
as
a
salutary
relief
from
the
pressure
of
absolutism
there
are
conditions
in
which
it
is
scarcely
a
hyperbole
to
say
that
slavery
itself
is
a
stage
on
the
road
to
freedom
therefore
we
are
not
so
much
concerned
this
evening
with
the
dead
letter
of
edicts
and
of
statutes
as
with
the
living
thoughts
of
men
a
century
ago
it
was
perfectly
well
known
that
whoever
had
one
audience
of
a
master
in
chancery
was
made
to
pay
for
three
but
no
man
heeded
the
enormity
until
it
suggested
to
a
young
lawyer
that
it
might
be
well
to
question
and
examine
with
rigorous
suspicion
every
part
of
a
system
in
which
such
things
were
done
the
day
on
which
that
gleam
lighted
up
the
clear
hard
mind
of
jeremy
bentham
is
memorable
in
the
political
calendar
beyond
the
entire
administration
of
many
statesmen
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
a
paragraph
in
augustine
or
a
sentence
of
grotius
that
outweighs
in
influence
the
acts
of
fifty
parliaments
and
our
cause
owes
more
to
cicero
and
seneca
to
vinet
and
tocqueville
than
to
the
laws
of
lycurgus
or
the
five
codes
of
france
by
liberty
i
mean
the
assurance
that
every
man
shall
be
protected
in
doing
what
he
believes
his
duty
against
the
influence
of
authority
and
majorities
custom
and
opinion
the
state
is
competent
to
assign
duties
and
draw
the
line
between
good
and
evil
only
in
its
immediate
sphere
beyond
the
limits
of
things
necessary
for
its
it
can
only
give
indirect
help
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
by
promoting
the
influences
which
prevail
against
temptation
religion
education
and
the
distribution
of
wealth
in
ancient
times
the
state
absorbed
authorities
not
its
own
and
intruded
on
the
domain
of
personal
freedom
in
the
middle
ages
it
possessed
too
little
authority
and
suffered
others
to
intrude
modern
states
fall
habitually
into
both
excesses
the
most
certain
test
by
which
we
judge
whether
a
country
is
really
free
is
the
amount
of
security
enjoyed
by
minorities
liberty
by
this
definition
is
the
essential
condition
and
guardian
of
religion
and
it
is
in
the
history
of
the
chosen
people
accordingly
that
the
first
illustrations
of
my
subject
are
obtained
the
government
of
the
israelites
was
a
federation
held
together
by
no
political
authority
but
by
the
unity
of
race
and
faith
and
founded
not
on
physical
force
but
on
a
voluntary
covenant
the
principle
of
was
carried
out
not
only
in
each
tribe
but
in
every
group
of
at
least
families
and
there
was
neither
privilege
of
rank
nor
inequality
before
the
law
monarchy
was
so
alien
to
the
primitive
spirit
of
the
community
that
it
was
resisted
by
samuel
in
that
momentous
protestation
and
warning
which
all
the
kingdoms
of
asia
and
many
of
the
kingdoms
of
europe
have
unceasingly
confirmed
the
throne
was
erected
on
a
compact
and
the
king
was
deprived
of
the
right
of
legislation
among
a
people
that
recognised
no
lawgiver
but
god
whose
highest
aim
in
politics
was
to
restore
the
original
purity
of
the
constitution
and
to
make
its
government
conform
to
the
ideal
type
that
was
hallowed
by
the
sanctions
of
heaven
the
inspired
men
who
rose
in
unfailing
succession
to
prophesy
against
the
usurper
and
the
tyrant
constantly
proclaimed
that
the
laws
which
were
divine
were
paramount
over
sinful
rulers
and
appealed
from
the
established
authorities
from
the
king
the
priests
and
the
princes
of
the
people
to
the
healing
forces
that
slept
in
the
uncorrupted
consciences
of
the
masses
thus
the
example
of
the
hebrew
nation
laid
down
the
parallel
lines
on
which
all
freedom
has
been
won
the
doctrine
of
national
tradition
and
the
doctrine
of
the
higher
law
the
principle
that
a
constitution
grows
from
a
root
by
process
of
development
and
not
of
essential
change
and
the
principle
that
all
political
authorities
must
be
tested
and
reformed
according
to
a
code
which
was
not
made
by
man
the
operation
of
these
principles
in
unison
or
in
antagonism
occupies
the
whole
of
the
space
we
are
going
over
together
the
conflict
between
liberty
under
divine
authority
and
the
absolutism
of
human
authorities
ended
disastrously
in
the
year
a
supreme
effort
was
made
at
jerusalem
to
reform
and
preserve
the
state
the
high
priest
produced
from
the
temple
of
jehovah
the
book
of
the
deserted
and
forgotten
law
and
both
king
and
people
bound
themselves
by
solemn
oaths
to
observe
it
but
that
early
example
of
limited
monarchy
and
of
the
supremacy
of
law
neither
lasted
nor
spread
and
the
forces
by
which
freedom
has
conquered
must
be
sought
elsewhere
in
the
very
year
in
which
the
flood
of
asiatic
despotism
closed
over
the
city
which
had
been
and
was
destined
again
to
be
the
sanctuary
of
freedom
in
the
east
a
new
home
was
prepared
for
it
in
the
west
where
guarded
by
the
sea
and
the
mountains
and
by
valiant
hearts
that
stately
plant
was
reared
under
whose
shade
we
dwell
and
which
is
extending
its
invincible
arms
so
slowly
and
yet
so
surely
over
the
civilised
world
according
to
a
famous
saying
of
the
most
famous
authoress
of
the
continent
liberty
is
ancient
and
it
is
despotism
that
is
new
it
has
been
the
pride
of
recent
historians
to
vindicate
the
truth
of
that
maxim
the
heroic
age
of
greece
confirms
it
and
it
is
still
more
conspicuously
true
of
teutonic
europe
wherever
we
can
trace
the
earlier
life
of
the
aryan
nations
we
discover
germs
which
favouring
circumstances
and
assiduous
culture
might
have
developed
into
free
societies
they
exhibit
some
sense
of
common
interest
in
common
concerns
little
reverence
for
external
authority
and
an
imperfect
sense
of
the
function
and
supremacy
of
the
state
where
the
division
of
property
and
labour
is
incomplete
there
is
little
division
of
classes
and
of
power
until
societies
are
tried
by
the
complex
problems
of
civilisation
they
may
escape
despotism
as
societies
that
are
undisturbed
by
religious
diversity
avoid
persecution
in
general
the
forms
of
the
patriarchal
age
failed
to
resist
the
growth
of
absolute
states
when
the
difficulties
and
temptations
of
advancing
life
began
to
tell
and
with
one
sovereign
exception
which
is
not
within
my
scope
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
trace
their
survival
in
the
institutions
of
later
times
six
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
absolutism
held
unbounded
sway
throughout
the
east
it
was
propped
by
the
unchanging
influence
of
priests
and
armies
in
the
west
where
there
were
no
sacred
books
requiring
trained
interpreters
the
priesthood
acquired
no
preponderance
and
when
the
kings
were
overthrown
their
powers
passed
to
aristocracies
of
birth
what
followed
during
many
generations
was
the
cruel
domination
of
class
over
class
the
oppression
of
the
poor
by
the
rich
and
of
the
ignorant
by
the
wise
the
spirit
of
that
domination
found
passionate
utterance
in
the
verses
of
the
aristocratic
poet
theognis
a
man
of
genius
and
refinement
who
avows
that
he
longed
to
drink
the
blood
of
his
political
adversaries
from
these
oppressors
the
people
of
many
cities
sought
deliverance
in
the
less
intolerable
tyranny
of
revolutionary
usurpers
the
remedy
gave
new
shape
and
energy
to
the
evil
the
tyrants
were
often
men
of
surprising
capacity
and
merit
like
some
of
those
who
in
the
fourteenth
century
made
themselves
lords
of
italian
cities
but
rights
secured
by
equal
laws
and
by
sharing
power
existed
nowhere
from
this
universal
degradation
the
world
was
rescued
by
the
most
gifted
of
the
nations
athens
which
like
other
cities
was
distracted
and
oppressed
by
a
privileged
class
avoided
violence
and
appointed
solon
to
revise
its
laws
it
was
the
happiest
choice
that
history
records
solon
was
not
only
the
wisest
man
to
be
found
in
athens
but
the
most
profound
political
genius
of
antiquity
and
the
easy
bloodless
and
pacific
revolution
by
which
he
accomplished
the
deliverance
of
his
country
was
the
first
step
in
a
career
which
our
age
glories
in
pursuing
and
instituted
a
power
which
has
done
more
than
anything
except
revealed
religion
for
the
regeneration
of
society
the
upper
class
had
possessed
the
right
of
making
and
administering
the
laws
and
he
left
them
in
possession
only
transferring
to
wealth
what
had
been
the
privilege
of
birth
to
the
rich
who
alone
had
the
means
of
sustaining
the
burden
of
public
service
in
taxation
and
war
solon
gave
a
share
of
power
proportioned
to
the
demands
made
on
their
resources
the
poorest
classes
were
exempt
from
direct
taxes
but
were
excluded
from
office
solon
gave
them
a
voice
in
electing
magistrates
from
the
classes
above
them
and
the
right
of
calling
them
to
account
this
concession
apparently
so
slender
was
the
beginning
of
a
mighty
change
it
introduced
the
idea
that
a
man
ought
to
have
a
voice
in
selecting
those
to
whose
rectitude
and
wisdom
he
is
compelled
to
trust
his
fortune
his
family
and
his
life
and
this
idea
completely
inverted
the
notion
of
human
authority
for
it
inaugurated
the
reign
of
moral
influence
where
all
political
power
had
depended
on
moral
force
government
by
consent
superseded
government
by
compulsion
and
the
pyramid
which
had
stood
on
a
point
was
made
to
stand
upon
its
base
by
making
every
citizen
the
guardian
of
his
own
interest
solon
admitted
the
element
of
democracy
into
the
state
the
greatest
glory
of
a
ruler
he
said
is
to
create
a
popular
government
believing
that
no
man
can
be
entirely
trusted
he
subjected
all
who
exercised
power
to
the
vigilant
control
of
those
for
whom
they
acted
the
only
resource
against
political
disorders
that
had
been
known
till
then
was
the
concentration
of
power
solon
undertook
to
effect
the
same
object
by
the
distribution
of
power
he
gave
to
the
common
people
as
much
influence
as
he
thought
them
able
to
employ
that
the
state
might
be
exempt
from
arbitrary
government
it
is
the
essence
of
democracy
he
said
to
obey
no
master
but
the
law
solon
recognised
the
principle
that
political
forms
are
not
final
or
inviolable
and
must
adapt
themselves
to
facts
and
he
provided
so
well
for
the
revision
of
his
constitution
without
breach
of
continuity
or
loss
of
stability
that
for
centuries
after
his
death
the
attic
orators
attributed
to
him
and
quoted
by
his
name
the
whole
structure
of
athenian
law
the
direction
of
its
growth
was
determined
by
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
solon
that
political
power
ought
to
be
commensurate
with
public
service
in
the
persian
war
the
services
of
the
democracy
eclipsed
those
of
the
patrician
orders
for
the
fleet
that
swept
the
asiatics
from
the
egean
sea
was
manned
by
the
poorer
athenians
that
class
whose
valour
had
saved
the
state
and
had
preserved
european
civilisation
had
gained
a
title
to
increase
of
influence
and
privilege
the
offices
of
state
which
had
been
a
monopoly
of
the
rich
were
thrown
open
to
the
poor
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
they
should
obtain
their
share
all
but
the
highest
commands
were
distributed
by
lot
whilst
the
ancient
authorities
were
decaying
there
was
no
accepted
standard
of
moral
and
political
right
to
make
the
framework
of
society
fast
in
the
midst
of
change
the
instability
that
had
seized
on
the
forms
threatened
the
very
principles
of
government
the
national
beliefs
were
yielding
to
doubt
and
doubt
was
not
yet
making
way
for
knowledge
there
had
been
a
time
when
the
obligations
of
public
as
well
as
private
life
were
identified
with
the
will
of
the
gods
but
that
time
had
passed
pallas
the
ethereal
goddess
of
the
athenians
and
the
sun
god
whose
oracles
delivered
from
the
temple
between
the
twin
summits
of
parnassus
did
so
much
for
the
greek
nationality
aided
in
keeping
up
a
lofty
ideal
of
religion
but
when
the
enlightened
men
of
greece
learnt
to
apply
their
keen
faculty
of
reasoning
to
the
system
of
their
inherited
belief
they
became
quickly
conscious
that
the
conceptions
of
the
gods
corrupted
the
life
and
degraded
the
minds
of
the
public
popular
morality
could
not
be
sustained
by
the
popular
religion
the
moral
instruction
which
was
no
longer
supplied
by
the
gods
could
not
yet
be
found
in
books
there
was
no
venerable
code
expounded
by
experts
no
doctrine
proclaimed
by
men
of
reputed
sanctity
like
those
teachers
of
the
far
east
whose
words
still
rule
the
fate
of
nearly
half
mankind
the
effort
to
account
for
things
by
close
observation
and
exact
reasoning
began
by
destroying
there
came
a
time
when
the
philosophers
of
the
porch
and
the
academy
wrought
the
dictates
of
wisdom
and
virtue
into
a
system
so
consistent
and
profound
that
it
has
vastly
shortened
the
task
of
the
christian
divines
but
that
time
had
not
yet
come
the
epoch
of
doubt
and
transition
during
which
the
greeks
passed
from
the
dim
fancies
of
mythology
to
the
fierce
light
of
science
was
the
age
of
pericles
and
the
endeavour
to
substitute
certain
truth
for
the
prescriptions
of
impaired
authorities
which
was
then
beginning
to
absorb
the
energies
of
the
greek
intellect
is
the
grandest
movement
in
the
profane
annals
of
mankind
for
to
it
we
owe
even
after
the
immeasurable
progress
accomplished
by
christianity
much
of
our
philosophy
and
far
the
better
part
of
the
political
knowledge
we
possess
pericles
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
athenian
government
was
the
first
statesman
who
encountered
the
problem
which
the
rapid
weakening
of
traditions
forced
on
the
political
world
no
authority
in
morals
or
in
politics
remained
unshaken
by
the
motion
that
was
in
the
air
no
guide
could
be
confidently
trusted
there
was
no
available
criterion
to
appeal
to
for
the
means
of
controlling
or
denying
convictions
that
prevailed
among
the
people
the
popular
sentiment
as
to
what
was
right
might
be
mistaken
but
it
was
subject
to
no
test
the
people
were
for
practical
purposes
the
seat
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
the
people
therefore
were
the
seat
of
power
the
political
philosophy
of
pericles
consisted
of
this
conclusion
he
resolutely
struck
away
all
the
props
that
still
sustained
the
artificial
preponderance
of
wealth
for
the
ancient
doctrine
that
power
goes
with
land
he
introduced
the
idea
that
power
ought
to
be
so
equitably
diffused
as
to
afford
equal
security
to
all
that
one
part
of
the
community
should
govern
the
whole
or
that
one
class
should
make
laws
for
another
he
declared
to
be
tyrannical
the
abolition
of
privilege
would
have
served
only
to
transfer
the
supremacy
from
the
rich
to
the
poor
if
pericles
had
not
redressed
the
balance
by
restricting
the
right
of
citizenship
to
athenians
of
pure
descent
by
this
measure
the
class
which
formed
what
we
should
call
the
third
estate
was
brought
down
to
citizens
and
became
about
equal
in
numbers
with
the
higher
ranks
pericles
held
that
every
athenian
who
neglected
to
take
his
part
in
the
public
business
inflicted
an
injury
on
the
commonwealth
that
none
might
be
excluded
by
poverty
he
caused
the
poor
to
be
paid
for
their
attendance
out
of
the
funds
of
the
state
for
his
administration
of
the
federal
tribute
had
brought
together
a
treasure
of
more
than
two
million
sterling
the
instrument
of
his
sway
was
the
art
of
speaking
he
governed
by
persuasion
everything
was
decided
by
argument
in
open
deliberation
and
every
influence
bowed
before
the
ascendency
of
mind
the
idea
that
the
object
of
constitutions
is
not
to
confirm
the
predominance
of
any
interest
but
to
prevent
it
to
preserve
with
equal
care
the
independence
of
labour
and
the
security
of
property
to
make
the
rich
safe
against
envy
and
the
poor
against
oppression
marks
the
highest
level
attained
by
the
statesmanship
of
greece
it
hardly
survived
the
great
patriot
who
conceived
it
and
all
history
has
been
occupied
with
the
endeavour
to
upset
the
balance
of
power
by
giving
the
advantage
to
money
land
or
numbers
a
generation
followed
that
has
never
been
equalled
in
talent
a
generation
of
men
whose
works
in
poetry
and
eloquence
are
still
the
envy
of
the
world
and
in
history
philosophy
and
politics
remain
unsurpassed
but
it
produced
no
successor
to
pericles
and
no
man
was
able
to
wield
the
sceptre
that
fell
from
his
hand
it
was
a
momentous
step
in
the
progress
of
nations
when
the
principle
that
every
interest
should
have
the
right
and
the
means
of
asserting
itself
was
adopted
by
the
athenian
constitution
but
for
those
who
were
beaten
in
the
vote
there
was
no
redress
the
law
did
not
check
the
triumph
of
majorities
or
rescue
the
minority
from
the
dire
penalty
of
having
been
outnumbered
when
the
overwhelming
influence
of
pericles
was
removed
the
conflict
between
classes
raged
without
restraint
and
the
slaughter
that
befell
the
higher
ranks
in
the
peloponnesian
war
gave
an
irresistible
preponderance
to
the
lower
the
restless
and
inquiring
spirit
of
the
athenians
was
prompt
to
unfold
the
reason
of
every
institution
and
the
consequences
of
every
principle
and
their
constitution
ran
its
course
from
infancy
to
decrepitude
with
unexampled
speed
two
men
lives
span
the
interval
from
the
first
admission
of
popular
influence
under
solon
to
the
downfall
of
the
state
their
history
furnishes
the
classic
example
of
the
peril
of
democracy
under
conditions
singularly
favourable
for
the
athenians
were
not
only
brave
and
patriotic
and
capable
of
generous
sacrifice
but
they
were
the
most
religious
of
the
greeks
they
venerated
the
constitution
which
had
given
them
prosperity
and
equality
and
freedom
and
never
questioned
the
fundamental
laws
which
regulated
the
enormous
power
of
the
assembly
they
tolerated
considerable
variety
of
opinion
and
great
licence
of
speech
and
their
humanity
towards
their
slaves
roused
the
indignation
even
of
the
most
intelligent
partisan
of
aristocracy
thus
they
became
the
only
people
of
antiquity
that
grew
great
by
democratic
institutions
but
the
possession
of
unlimited
power
which
corrodes
the
conscience
hardens
the
heart
and
confounds
the
understanding
of
monarchs
exercised
its
demoralising
influence
on
the
illustrious
democracy
of
athens
it
is
bad
to
be
oppressed
by
a
minority
but
it
is
worse
to
be
oppressed
by
a
majority
for
there
is
a
reserve
of
latent
power
in
the
masses
which
if
it
is
called
into
play
the
minority
can
seldom
resist
but
from
the
absolute
will
of
an
entire
people
there
is
no
appeal
no
redemption
no
refuge
but
treason
the
humblest
and
most
numerous
class
of
the
athenians
united
the
legislative
the
judicial
and
in
part
the
executive
power
the
philosophy
that
was
then
in
the
ascendant
taught
them
that
there
is
no
law
superior
to
that
of
the
state
the
lawgiver
is
above
the
law
it
followed
that
the
sovereign
people
had
a
right
to
do
whatever
was
within
its
power
and
was
bound
by
no
rule
of
right
or
wrong
but
its
own
judgment
of
expediency
on
a
memorable
occasion
the
assembled
athenians
declared
it
monstrous
that
they
should
be
prevented
from
doing
whatever
they
chose
no
force
that
existed
could
restrain
them
and
they
resolved
that
no
duty
should
restrain
them
and
that
they
would
be
bound
by
no
laws
that
were
not
of
their
own
making
in
this
way
the
emancipated
people
of
athens
became
a
tyrant
and
their
government
the
pioneer
of
european
freedom
stands
condemned
with
a
terrible
unanimity
by
all
the
wisest
of
the
ancients
they
ruined
their
city
by
attempting
to
conduct
war
by
debate
in
the
marketplace
like
the
french
republic
they
put
their
unsuccessful
commanders
to
death
they
treated
their
dependencies
with
such
injustice
that
they
lost
their
maritime
empire
they
plundered
the
rich
until
the
rich
conspired
with
the
public
enemy
and
they
crowned
their
guilt
by
the
martyrdom
of
socrates
when
the
absolute
sway
of
numbers
had
endured
for
near
a
quarter
of
a
century
nothing
but
bare
existence
was
left
for
the
state
to
lose
and
the
athenians
wearied
and
despondent
confessed
the
true
cause
of
their
ruin
they
understood
that
for
liberty
justice
and
equal
laws
it
is
as
necessary
that
democracy
should
restrain
itself
as
it
had
been
that
it
should
restrain
the
oligarchy
they
resolved
to
take
their
stand
once
more
upon
the
ancient
ways
and
to
restore
the
order
of
things
which
had
subsisted
when
the
monopoly
of
power
had
been
taken
from
the
rich
and
had
not
been
acquired
by
the
poor
after
a
first
restoration
had
failed
which
is
only
memorable
because
thucydides
whose
judgment
in
politics
is
never
at
fault
pronounced
it
the
best
government
athens
had
enjoyed
the
attempt
was
renewed
with
more
experience
and
greater
singleness
of
purpose
the
hostile
parties
were
reconciled
and
proclaimed
an
amnesty
the
first
in
history
they
resolved
to
govern
by
concurrence
the
laws
which
had
the
sanction
of
tradition
were
reduced
to
a
code
and
no
act
of
the
sovereign
assembly
was
valid
with
which
they
might
be
found
to
disagree
between
the
sacred
lines
of
the
constitution
which
were
to
remain
inviolate
and
the
decrees
which
met
from
time
to
time
the
needs
and
notions
of
the
day
a
broad
distinction
was
drawn
and
the
fabric
of
a
law
which
had
been
the
work
of
generations
was
made
independent
of
momentary
variations
in
the
popular
will
the
repentance
of
the
athenians
came
too
late
to
save
the
republic
but
the
lesson
of
their
experience
endures
for
all
times
for
it
teaches
that
government
by
the
whole
people
being
the
government
of
the
most
numerous
and
most
powerful
class
is
an
evil
of
the
same
nature
as
unmixed
monarchy
and
requires
for
nearly
the
same
reasons
institutions
that
shall
protect
it
against
itself
and
shall
uphold
the
permanent
reign
of
law
against
arbitrary
revolutions
of
opinion
parallel
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
athenian
freedom
rome
was
employed
in
working
out
the
same
problems
with
greater
constructive
sense
and
greater
temporary
success
but
ending
at
last
in
a
far
more
terrible
catastrophe
that
which
among
the
ingenious
athenians
had
been
a
development
carried
forward
by
the
spell
of
plausible
argument
was
in
rome
a
conflict
between
rival
forces
speculative
politics
had
no
attraction
for
the
grim
and
practical
genius
of
the
romans
they
did
not
consider
what
would
be
the
cleverest
way
of
getting
over
a
difficulty
but
what
way
was
indicated
by
analogous
cases
and
they
assigned
less
influence
to
the
impulse
and
spirit
of
the
moment
than
to
precedent
and
example
their
peculiar
character
prompted
them
to
ascribe
the
origin
of
their
laws
to
early
times
and
in
their
desire
to
justify
the
continuity
of
their
institutions
and
to
get
rid
of
the
reproach
of
innovation
they
imagined
the
legendary
history
of
the
kings
of
rome
the
energy
of
their
adherence
to
traditions
made
their
progress
slow
they
advanced
only
under
compulsion
of
almost
unavoidable
necessity
and
the
same
questions
recurred
often
before
they
were
settled
the
constitutional
history
of
the
republic
turns
on
the
endeavours
of
the
aristocracy
who
claimed
to
be
the
only
true
romans
to
retain
in
their
hands
the
power
they
had
wrested
from
the
kings
and
of
the
plebeians
to
get
an
equal
share
in
it
and
this
controversy
which
the
eager
and
restless
athenians
went
through
in
one
generation
lasted
for
more
than
two
centuries
from
a
time
when
the
were
excluded
from
the
government
of
the
city
and
were
taxed
and
made
to
serve
without
pay
until
in
the
year
they
were
admitted
to
political
equality
then
followed
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
unexampled
prosperity
and
glory
and
then
out
of
the
original
conflict
which
had
been
compromised
if
not
theoretically
settled
a
new
struggle
arose
which
was
without
an
issue
the
mass
of
poorer
families
impoverished
by
incessant
service
in
war
were
reduced
to
dependence
on
an
aristocracy
of
about
two
thousand
wealthy
men
who
divided
among
themselves
the
immense
domain
of
the
state
when
the
need
became
intense
the
gracchi
tried
to
relieve
it
by
inducing
the
richer
classes
to
allot
some
share
in
the
public
lands
to
the
common
people
the
old
and
famous
aristocracy
of
birth
and
rank
had
made
a
stubborn
resistance
but
it
knew
the
art
of
yielding
the
later
and
more
selfish
aristocracy
was
unable
to
learn
it
the
character
of
the
people
was
changed
by
the
sterner
motives
of
dispute
the
fight
for
political
power
had
been
carried
on
with
the
moderation
which
is
so
honourable
a
quality
of
party
contests
in
england
but
the
struggle
for
the
objects
of
material
existence
grew
to
be
as
ferocious
as
civil
controversies
in
france
repulsed
by
the
rich
after
a
struggle
of
years
the
people
three
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
of
whom
depended
on
public
rations
for
food
were
ready
to
follow
any
man
who
promised
to
obtain
for
them
by
revolution
what
they
could
not
obtain
by
law
for
a
time
the
senate
representing
the
ancient
and
threatened
order
of
things
was
strong
enough
to
overcome
every
popular
leader
that
arose
until
julius
cæsar
supported
by
an
army
which
he
had
led
in
an
unparalleled
career
of
conquest
and
by
the
famished
masses
which
he
won
by
his
lavish
liberality
and
skilled
beyond
all
other
men
in
the
art
of
governing
converted
the
republic
into
a
monarchy
by
a
series
of
measures
that
were
neither
violent
nor
injurious
the
empire
preserved
the
republican
forms
until
the
reign
of
diocletian
but
the
will
of
the
emperors
was
as
uncontrolled
as
that
of
the
people
had
been
after
the
victory
of
the
tribunes
their
power
was
arbitrary
even
when
it
was
most
wisely
employed
and
yet
the
roman
empire
rendered
greater
services
to
the
cause
of
liberty
than
the
roman
republic
i
do
not
mean
by
reason
of
the
temporary
accident
that
there
were
emperors
who
made
good
use
of
their
immense
opportunities
such
as
nerva
of
whom
tacitus
says
that
he
combined
monarchy
and
liberty
things
otherwise
incompatible
or
that
the
empire
was
what
its
panegyrists
declared
it
the
perfection
of
democracy
in
truth
it
was
at
best
an
and
odious
despotism
but
frederic
the
great
was
a
despot
yet
he
was
a
friend
to
toleration
and
free
discussion
the
bonapartes
were
despotic
yet
no
liberal
ruler
was
ever
more
acceptable
to
the
masses
of
the
people
than
the
first
napoleon
after
he
had
destroyed
the
republic
in
and
the
third
napoleon
at
the
height
of
his
power
in
in
the
same
way
the
roman
empire
possessed
merits
which
at
a
distance
and
especially
at
a
great
distance
of
time
concern
men
more
deeply
than
the
tragic
tyranny
which
was
felt
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
palace
the
poor
had
what
they
had
demanded
in
vain
of
the
republic
the
rich
fared
better
than
during
the
triumvirate
the
rights
of
roman
citizens
were
extended
to
the
people
of
the
provinces
to
the
imperial
epoch
belong
the
better
part
of
roman
literature
and
nearly
the
entire
civil
law
and
it
was
the
empire
that
mitigated
slavery
instituted
religious
toleration
made
a
beginning
of
the
law
of
nations
and
created
a
perfect
system
of
the
law
of
property
the
republic
which
cæsar
overthrew
had
been
anything
but
a
free
state
it
provided
admirable
securities
for
the
rights
of
citizens
it
treated
with
savage
disregard
the
rights
of
men
and
allowed
the
free
roman
to
inflict
atrocious
wrongs
on
his
children
on
debtors
and
dependants
on
prisoners
and
slaves
those
deeper
ideas
of
right
and
duty
which
are
not
found
on
the
tables
of
municipal
law
but
with
which
the
generous
minds
of
greece
were
conversant
were
held
of
little
account
and
the
philosophy
which
dealt
with
such
speculations
was
repeatedly
proscribed
as
a
teacher
of
sedition
and
impiety
at
length
in
the
year
the
athenian
philosopher
carneades
appeared
at
rome
on
a
political
mission
during
an
interval
of
official
business
he
delivered
two
public
orations
to
give
the
unlettered
conquerors
of
his
country
a
taste
of
the
disputations
that
flourished
in
the
attic
schools
on
the
first
day
he
discoursed
of
natural
justice
on
the
next
he
denied
its
existence
arguing
that
all
our
notions
of
good
and
evil
are
derived
from
positive
enactment
from
the
time
of
that
memorable
display
the
genius
of
the
vanquished
held
its
conquerors
in
thrall
the
most
eminent
of
the
public
men
of
rome
such
as
scipio
and
cicero
formed
their
minds
on
grecian
models
and
her
jurists
underwent
the
rigorous
discipline
of
zeno
and
chrysippus
if
drawing
the
limit
in
the
second
century
when
the
influence
of
christianity
becomes
perceptible
we
should
form
our
judgment
of
the
politics
of
antiquity
by
its
actual
legislation
our
estimate
would
be
low
the
prevailing
notions
of
freedom
were
imperfect
and
the
endeavours
to
realise
them
were
wide
of
the
mark
the
ancients
understood
the
regulation
of
power
better
than
the
regulation
of
liberty
they
concentrated
so
many
prerogatives
in
the
state
as
to
leave
no
footing
from
which
a
man
could
deny
its
jurisdiction
or
assign
bounds
to
its
activity
if
i
may
employ
an
expressive
anachronism
the
vice
of
the
classic
state
was
that
it
was
both
church
and
state
in
one
morality
was
undistinguished
from
religion
and
politics
from
morals
and
in
religion
morality
and
politics
there
was
only
one
legislator
and
one
authority
the
state
while
it
did
deplorably
little
for
education
for
practical
science
for
the
indigent
and
helpless
or
for
the
spiritual
needs
of
man
nevertheless
claimed
the
use
of
all
his
faculties
and
the
determination
of
all
his
duties
individuals
and
families
associations
and
dependencies
were
so
much
material
that
the
sovereign
power
consumed
for
its
own
purposes
what
the
slave
was
in
the
hands
of
his
master
the
citizen
was
in
the
hands
of
the
community
the
most
sacred
obligations
vanished
before
the
public
advantage
the
passengers
existed
for
the
sake
of
the
ship
by
their
disregard
for
private
interests
and
for
the
moral
welfare
and
improvement
of
the
people
both
greece
and
rome
destroyed
the
vital
elements
on
which
the
prosperity
of
nations
rests
and
perished
by
the
decay
of
families
and
the
depopulation
of
the
country
they
survive
not
in
their
institutions
but
in
their
ideas
and
by
their
ideas
especially
on
the
art
of
government
they
are
the
dead
but
sceptred
sovereigns
who
still
rule
our
spirits
from
their
urns
to
them
indeed
may
be
tracked
nearly
all
the
errors
that
are
undermining
political
society
communism
utilitarianism
the
confusion
between
tyranny
and
authority
and
between
lawlessness
and
freedom
the
notion
that
men
lived
originally
in
a
state
of
nature
by
violence
and
without
laws
is
due
to
critias
communism
in
its
grossest
form
was
recommended
by
diogenes
of
sinope
according
to
the
sophists
there
is
no
duty
above
expediency
and
no
virtue
apart
from
pleasure
laws
are
an
invention
of
weak
men
to
rob
their
betters
of
the
reasonable
enjoyment
of
their
superiority
it
is
better
to
inflict
than
to
suffer
wrong
and
as
there
is
no
greater
good
than
to
do
evil
without
fear
of
retribution
so
there
is
no
worse
evil
than
to
suffer
without
the
consolation
of
revenge
justice
is
the
mask
of
a
craven
spirit
injustice
is
worldly
wisdom
and
duty
obedience
are
the
impostures
of
hypocrisy
government
is
absolute
and
may
ordain
what
it
pleases
and
no
subject
can
complain
that
it
does
him
wrong
but
as
long
as
he
can
escape
compulsion
and
punishment
he
is
always
free
to
disobey
happiness
consists
in
obtaining
power
and
in
eluding
the
necessity
of
obedience
and
he
that
gains
a
throne
by
perfidy
and
murder
deserves
to
be
truly
envied
epicurus
differed
but
little
from
the
propounders
of
the
code
of
revolutionary
despotism
all
societies
he
said
are
founded
on
contract
for
mutual
protection
good
and
evil
are
conventional
terms
for
the
thunderbolts
of
heaven
fall
alike
on
the
just
and
the
unjust
the
objection
to
wrongdoing
is
not
the
act
but
in
its
consequences
to
the
wrongdoer
wise
men
contrive
laws
not
to
bind
but
to
protect
themselves
and
when
they
prove
to
be
unprofitable
they
cease
to
be
valid
the
illiberal
sentiments
of
even
the
most
illustrious
metaphysicians
are
disclosed
in
the
saying
of
aristotle
that
the
mark
of
the
worst
governments
is
that
they
leave
men
free
to
live
as
they
please
if
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
socrates
the
best
of
the
pagans
knew
of
no
higher
criterion
for
men
of
no
better
guide
of
conduct
than
the
laws
of
each
country
that
plato
whose
sublime
doctrine
was
so
near
an
anticipation
of
christianity
that
celebrated
theologians
wished
his
works
to
be
forbidden
lest
men
should
be
content
with
them
and
indifferent
to
any
higher
dogma
to
whom
was
granted
that
prophetic
vision
of
the
just
man
accused
condemned
and
scourged
and
dying
on
a
cross
nevertheless
employed
the
most
splendid
intellect
ever
bestowed
on
man
to
advocate
the
abolition
of
the
family
and
the
exposure
of
infants
that
aristotle
the
ablest
moralist
of
antiquity
saw
no
harm
in
making
raids
upon
a
neighbouring
people
for
the
sake
of
reducing
them
to
slavery
still
more
if
you
will
consider
that
among
the
moderns
men
of
genius
equal
to
these
have
held
political
doctrines
not
less
criminal
or
absurd
it
will
be
apparent
to
you
how
stubborn
a
phalanx
of
error
blocks
the
paths
of
truth
that
pure
reason
is
as
powerless
as
custom
to
solve
the
problem
of
free
government
that
it
can
only
be
the
fruit
of
long
manifold
and
painful
experience
and
that
the
tracing
of
the
methods
by
which
divine
wisdom
has
educated
the
nations
to
appreciate
and
to
assume
the
duties
of
freedom
is
not
the
least
part
of
that
true
philosophy
that
studies
to
assert
eternal
providence
and
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
men
but
having
sounded
the
depth
of
their
errors
i
should
give
you
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
if
i
allowed
it
to
appear
that
their
precepts
were
no
better
than
their
practice
while
statesmen
and
senates
and
popular
assemblies
supplied
examples
of
every
description
of
blunder
a
noble
literature
arose
in
which
a
priceless
treasure
of
political
knowledge
was
stored
and
in
which
the
defects
of
the
existing
institutions
were
exposed
with
unsparing
sagacity
the
point
on
which
the
ancients
were
most
nearly
unanimous
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
govern
and
their
inability
to
govern
alone
to
meet
this
difficulty
to
give
to
the
popular
element
a
full
share
without
a
monopoly
of
power
they
adopted
very
generally
the
theory
of
a
mixed
constitution
they
differed
from
our
notion
of
the
same
thing
because
modern
constitutions
have
been
a
device
for
limiting
monarchy
with
them
they
were
invented
to
curb
democracy
the
idea
arose
in
the
time
of
plato
though
he
repelled
it
when
the
early
monarchies
and
oligarchies
had
vanished
and
it
continued
to
be
cherished
long
after
all
democracies
had
been
absorbed
in
the
roman
empire
but
whereas
a
sovereign
prince
who
surrenders
part
of
his
authority
yields
to
the
argument
of
superior
force
a
sovereign
people
relinquishing
its
own
prerogative
succumbs
to
the
influence
of
reason
and
it
has
in
all
times
proved
more
easy
to
create
limitations
by
the
use
of
force
than
by
persuasion
the
ancient
writers
saw
very
clearly
that
each
principle
of
government
standing
alone
is
carried
to
excess
and
provokes
a
reaction
monarchy
hardens
into
despotism
aristocracy
contracts
into
oligarchy
democracy
expands
into
the
supremacy
of
numbers
they
therefore
imagined
that
to
restrain
each
element
by
combining
it
with
the
others
would
avert
the
natural
process
of
and
endow
the
state
with
perpetual
youth
but
this
harmony
of
monarchy
aristocracy
and
democracy
blended
together
which
was
the
ideal
of
many
writers
and
which
they
supposed
to
be
exhibited
by
sparta
by
carthage
and
by
rome
was
a
chimera
of
philosophers
never
realised
by
antiquity
at
last
tacitus
wiser
than
the
rest
confessed
that
the
mixed
constitution
however
admirable
in
theory
was
difficult
to
establish
and
impossible
to
maintain
his
disheartening
avowal
is
not
disowned
by
later
experience
the
experiment
has
been
tried
more
often
than
i
can
tell
with
a
combination
of
resources
that
were
unknown
to
the
ancients
with
christianity
parliamentary
government
and
a
free
press
yet
there
is
no
example
of
such
a
balanced
constitution
having
lasted
a
century
if
it
has
succeeded
anywhere
it
has
been
in
our
favoured
country
and
in
our
time
and
we
know
not
yet
how
long
the
wisdom
of
the
nation
will
preserve
the
equipoise
the
federal
check
was
as
familiar
to
the
ancients
as
the
constitutional
for
the
type
of
all
their
republics
was
the
government
of
a
city
by
its
own
inhabitants
meeting
in
the
public
place
an
administration
embracing
many
cities
was
known
to
them
only
in
the
form
of
the
oppression
which
sparta
exercised
over
the
messenians
athens
over
her
confederates
and
rome
over
italy
the
resources
which
in
modern
times
enabled
a
great
people
to
govern
itself
through
a
single
centre
did
not
exist
equality
could
be
preserved
only
by
federalism
and
it
occurs
more
often
amongst
them
than
in
the
modern
world
if
the
distribution
of
power
among
the
several
parts
of
the
state
is
the
most
efficient
restraint
on
monarchy
the
distribution
of
power
among
several
states
is
the
best
check
on
democracy
by
multiplying
centres
of
government
and
discussion
it
promotes
the
diffusion
of
political
knowledge
and
the
maintenance
of
healthy
and
independent
opinion
it
is
the
protectorate
of
minorities
and
the
consecration
of
but
although
it
must
be
enumerated
among
the
better
achievements
of
practical
genius
in
antiquity
it
arose
from
necessity
and
its
properties
were
imperfectly
investigated
in
theory
when
the
greeks
began
to
reflect
on
the
problems
of
society
they
first
of
all
accepted
things
as
they
were
and
did
their
best
to
explain
and
defend
them
inquiry
which
with
us
is
stimulated
by
doubt
began
with
them
in
wonder
the
most
illustrious
of
the
early
philosophers
pythagoras
promulgated
a
theory
for
the
preservation
of
political
power
in
the
educated
class
and
ennobled
a
form
of
government
which
was
generally
founded
on
popular
ignorance
and
on
strong
class
interests
he
preached
authority
and
subordination
and
dwelt
more
on
duties
than
on
rights
on
religion
than
on
policy
and
his
system
perished
in
the
revolution
by
which
oligarchies
were
swept
away
the
revolution
afterwards
developed
its
own
philosophy
whose
excesses
i
have
described
but
between
the
two
eras
between
the
rigid
didactics
of
the
early
pythagoreans
and
the
dissolving
theories
of
protagoras
a
philosopher
arose
who
stood
aloof
from
both
extremes
and
whose
difficult
sayings
were
never
really
understood
or
valued
until
our
time
heraclitus
of
ephesus
deposited
his
book
in
the
temple
of
diana
the
book
has
perished
like
the
temple
and
the
worship
but
its
fragments
have
been
collected
and
interpreted
with
incredible
ardour
by
the
scholars
the
divines
the
philosophers
and
politicians
who
have
been
engaged
the
most
intensely
in
the
toil
and
stress
of
this
century
the
most
renowned
logician
of
the
last
century
adopted
every
one
of
his
propositions
and
the
most
brilliant
agitator
among
continental
socialists
composed
a
work
of
eight
hundred
and
forty
pages
to
celebrate
his
memory
heraclitus
complained
that
the
masses
were
deaf
to
truth
and
knew
not
that
one
good
man
counts
for
more
than
thousands
but
he
held
the
existing
order
in
no
superstitious
reverence
strife
he
says
is
the
source
and
the
master
of
all
things
life
is
perpetual
motion
and
repose
is
death
no
man
can
plunge
twice
into
the
same
current
for
it
is
always
flowing
and
passing
and
is
never
the
same
the
only
thing
fixed
and
certain
in
the
midst
of
change
is
the
universal
and
sovereign
reason
which
all
men
may
not
perceive
but
which
is
common
to
all
laws
are
sustained
by
no
human
authority
but
by
virtue
of
their
derivation
from
the
one
law
that
is
divine
these
sayings
which
recall
the
grand
outlines
of
political
truth
which
we
have
found
in
the
sacred
books
and
carry
us
forward
to
the
latest
teaching
of
our
most
enlightened
contemporaries
would
bear
a
good
deal
of
elucidation
and
comment
heraclitus
is
unfortunately
so
obscure
that
socrates
could
not
understand
him
and
i
wo
pretend
to
have
succeeded
better
if
the
topic
of
my
address
was
the
history
of
political
science
the
highest
and
the
largest
place
would
belong
to
plato
and
aristotle
the
of
the
one
the
of
the
other
are
if
i
may
trust
my
own
experience
the
books
from
which
we
may
learn
the
most
about
the
principles
of
politics
the
penetration
with
which
those
great
masters
of
thought
analysed
the
institutions
of
greece
and
exposed
their
vices
is
not
surpassed
by
anything
in
later
literature
by
burke
or
hamilton
the
best
political
writers
of
the
last
century
by
tocqueville
or
roscher
the
most
eminent
of
our
own
but
plato
and
aristotle
were
philosophers
studious
not
of
unguided
freedom
but
of
intelligent
government
they
saw
the
disastrous
effects
of
striving
for
liberty
and
they
resolved
that
it
was
better
not
to
strive
for
it
but
to
be
content
with
a
strong
administration
prudently
adapted
to
make
men
prosperous
and
happy
now
liberty
and
good
government
do
not
exclude
each
other
and
there
are
excellent
reasons
why
they
should
go
together
liberty
is
not
a
means
to
a
higher
political
end
it
is
itself
the
highest
political
end
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
a
good
public
administration
that
it
is
required
but
for
security
in
the
pursuit
of
the
highest
objects
of
civil
society
and
of
private
life
increase
of
freedom
in
the
state
may
sometimes
promote
mediocrity
and
give
vitality
to
prejudice
it
may
even
retard
useful
legislation
diminish
the
capacity
for
war
and
restrict
the
boundaries
of
empire
it
might
be
plausibly
argued
that
if
many
things
would
be
worse
in
england
or
ireland
under
an
intelligent
despotism
some
things
would
be
managed
better
that
the
roman
government
was
more
enlightened
under
augustus
and
antoninus
than
under
the
senate
in
the
days
of
marius
or
of
pompey
a
generous
spirit
prefers
that
his
country
should
be
poor
and
weak
and
of
no
account
but
free
rather
than
powerful
prosperous
and
enslaved
it
is
better
to
be
the
citizen
of
a
humble
commonwealth
in
the
alps
without
a
prospect
of
influence
beyond
the
narrow
frontier
than
a
subject
of
the
superb
autocracy
that
overshadows
half
of
asia
and
of
europe
but
it
may
be
urged
on
the
other
side
that
liberty
is
not
the
sum
or
the
substitute
of
all
the
things
men
ought
to
live
for
that
to
be
real
it
must
be
circumscribed
and
that
the
limits
of
circumscription
vary
that
advancing
civilisation
invests
the
state
with
increased
rights
and
duties
and
imposes
increased
burdens
and
constraint
on
the
subject
that
a
highly
instructed
and
intelligent
community
may
perceive
the
benefit
of
compulsory
obligations
which
at
a
lower
stage
would
be
thought
unbearable
that
liberal
progress
is
not
vague
or
indefinite
but
aims
at
a
point
where
the
public
is
subject
to
no
restrictions
but
those
of
which
it
feels
the
advantage
that
a
free
country
may
be
less
capable
of
doing
much
for
the
advancement
of
religion
the
prevention
of
vice
or
the
relief
of
suffering
than
one
that
does
not
shrink
from
confronting
great
emergencies
by
some
sacrifice
of
individual
rights
and
some
concentration
of
power
and
that
the
supreme
political
object
ought
to
be
sometimes
postponed
to
still
higher
moral
objects
my
argument
involves
no
collision
with
these
qualifying
reflections
we
are
dealing
not
with
the
effects
of
freedom
but
with
its
causes
we
are
seeking
out
the
influences
which
brought
arbitrary
government
under
control
either
by
the
diffusion
of
power
or
by
the
appeal
to
an
authority
which
transcends
all
government
and
among
those
influences
the
greatest
philosophers
of
greece
have
no
claim
to
be
reckoned
it
is
the
stoics
who
emancipated
mankind
from
its
subjugation
to
despotic
rule
and
whose
enlightened
and
elevated
views
of
life
bridged
the
chasm
that
separates
the
ancient
from
the
christian
state
and
led
the
way
to
freedom
seeing
how
little
security
there
is
that
the
laws
of
any
land
shall
be
wise
or
just
and
that
the
unanimous
will
of
a
people
and
the
assent
of
nations
are
liable
to
err
the
stoics
looked
beyond
those
narrow
barriers
and
above
those
inferior
sanctions
for
the
principles
that
ought
to
regulate
the
lives
of
men
and
the
existence
of
society
they
made
it
known
that
there
is
a
will
superior
to
the
collective
will
of
man
and
a
law
that
overrules
those
of
solon
and
lycurgus
their
test
of
good
government
is
its
conformity
to
principles
that
can
be
traced
to
a
higher
legislator
that
which
we
must
obey
that
to
which
we
are
bound
to
reduce
all
civil
authorities
and
to
sacrifice
every
earthly
interest
is
that
immutable
law
which
is
perfect
and
eternal
as
god
himself
which
proceeds
from
his
nature
and
reigns
over
heaven
and
earth
and
over
all
the
nations
the
great
question
is
to
discover
not
what
governments
prescribe
but
what
they
ought
to
prescribe
for
no
prescription
is
valid
against
the
conscience
of
mankind
before
god
there
is
neither
greek
nor
barbarian
neither
rich
nor
poor
and
the
slave
is
as
good
as
his
master
for
by
birth
all
men
are
free
they
are
citizens
of
that
universal
commonwealth
which
embraces
all
the
world
brethren
of
one
family
and
children
of
god
the
true
guide
of
our
conduct
is
no
outward
authority
but
the
voice
of
god
who
comes
down
to
dwell
in
our
souls
who
knows
all
our
thoughts
to
whom
are
owing
all
the
truth
we
know
and
all
the
good
we
do
for
vice
is
voluntary
and
virtue
comes
from
the
grace
of
the
heavenly
spirit
within
what
the
teaching
of
that
divine
voice
is
the
philosophers
who
had
imbibed
the
sublime
ethics
of
the
porch
went
on
to
expound
it
is
not
enough
to
act
up
to
the
written
law
or
to
give
all
men
their
due
we
ought
to
give
them
more
than
their
due
to
be
generous
and
beneficent
to
devote
ourselves
for
the
good
of
others
seeking
our
reward
in
and
sacrifice
acting
from
the
motive
of
sympathy
and
not
of
personal
advantage
therefore
we
must
treat
others
as
we
wish
to
be
treated
by
them
and
must
persist
until
death
in
doing
good
to
our
enemies
regardless
of
unworthiness
and
ingratitude
for
we
must
be
at
war
with
evil
but
at
peace
with
men
and
it
is
better
to
suffer
than
to
commit
injustice
true
freedom
says
the
most
eloquent
of
the
stoics
consists
in
obeying
god
a
state
governed
by
such
principles
as
these
would
have
been
free
far
beyond
the
measure
of
greek
or
roman
freedom
for
they
open
a
door
to
religious
toleration
and
close
it
against
slavery
neither
conquest
nor
purchase
said
zeno
can
make
one
man
the
property
of
another
these
doctrines
were
adopted
and
applied
by
the
great
jurists
of
the
empire
the
law
of
nature
they
said
is
superior
to
the
written
law
and
slavery
contradicts
the
law
of
nature
men
have
no
right
to
do
what
they
please
with
their
own
or
to
make
profit
out
of
another
loss
such
is
the
political
wisdom
of
the
ancients
touching
the
foundations
of
liberty
as
we
find
it
in
its
highest
development
in
cicero
and
seneca
and
philo
a
jew
of
alexandria
their
writings
impress
upon
us
the
greatness
of
the
work
of
preparation
for
the
gospel
which
had
been
accomplished
among
men
on
the
eve
of
the
mission
of
the
apostles
augustine
after
quoting
seneca
exclaims
what
more
could
a
christian
say
than
this
pagan
has
said
the
enlightened
pagans
had
reached
nearly
the
last
point
attainable
without
a
new
dispensation
when
the
fulness
of
time
was
come
we
have
seen
the
breadth
and
the
splendour
of
the
domain
of
hellenic
thought
and
it
has
brought
us
to
the
threshold
of
a
greater
kingdom
the
best
of
the
later
classics
speak
almost
the
language
of
christianity
and
they
border
on
its
spirit
but
in
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
cite
from
classical
literature
three
things
are
wanting
representative
government
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
and
liberty
of
conscience
there
were
it
is
true
deliberative
assemblies
chosen
by
the
people
and
confederate
cities
of
which
both
in
asia
and
africa
there
were
so
many
leagues
sent
their
delegates
to
sit
in
federal
councils
but
government
by
an
elected
parliament
was
even
in
theory
a
thing
unknown
it
is
congruous
with
the
nature
of
polytheism
to
admit
some
measure
of
toleration
and
socrates
when
he
avowed
that
he
must
obey
god
rather
than
the
athenians
and
the
stoics
when
they
set
the
wise
man
above
the
law
were
very
near
giving
utterance
to
the
principle
but
it
was
first
proclaimed
and
established
by
enactment
not
in
polytheistic
and
philosophical
greece
but
in
india
by
asoka
the
earliest
of
the
buddhist
kings
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
slavery
has
been
far
more
than
intolerance
the
perpetual
curse
and
reproach
of
ancient
civilisation
and
although
its
rightfulness
was
disputed
as
early
as
the
days
of
aristotle
and
was
implicitly
if
not
definitely
denied
by
several
stoics
the
moral
philosophy
of
the
greeks
and
romans
as
well
as
their
practice
pronounced
decidedly
in
its
favour
but
there
was
one
extraordinary
people
who
in
this
as
in
other
things
anticipated
the
purer
precept
that
was
to
come
philo
of
alexandria
is
one
of
the
writers
whose
views
on
society
were
most
advanced
he
applauds
not
only
liberty
but
equality
in
the
enjoyment
of
wealth
he
believes
that
a
limited
democracy
purged
of
its
grosser
elements
is
the
most
perfect
government
and
will
extend
itself
gradually
over
all
the
world
by
freedom
he
understood
the
following
of
god
philo
though
he
required
that
the
condition
of
the
slave
should
be
made
compatible
with
the
wants
and
claims
of
his
higher
nature
did
not
absolutely
condemn
slavery
but
he
has
put
on
record
the
customs
of
the
essenes
of
palestine
a
people
who
uniting
the
wisdom
of
the
gentiles
with
the
faith
of
the
jews
led
lives
which
were
uncontaminated
by
the
surrounding
civilisation
and
were
the
first
to
reject
slavery
both
in
principle
and
practice
they
formed
a
religious
community
rather
than
a
state
and
their
numbers
did
not
exceed
but
their
example
testifies
to
how
great
a
height
religious
men
were
able
to
raise
their
conception
of
society
even
without
the
succour
of
the
new
testament
and
affords
the
strongest
condemnation
of
their
contemporaries
this
then
is
the
conclusion
to
which
our
survey
brings
us
there
is
hardly
a
truth
in
politics
or
in
the
system
of
the
rights
of
man
that
was
not
grasped
by
the
wisest
of
the
gentiles
and
the
jews
or
that
they
did
not
declare
with
a
refinement
of
thought
and
a
nobleness
of
expression
that
later
writers
could
never
surpass
i
might
go
on
for
hours
reciting
to
you
passages
on
the
law
of
nature
and
the
duties
of
man
so
solemn
and
religious
that
though
they
come
from
the
profane
theatre
on
the
acropolis
and
from
the
roman
forum
you
would
deem
that
you
were
listening
to
the
hymns
of
christian
churches
and
the
discourse
of
ordained
divines
but
although
the
maxims
of
the
great
classic
teachers
of
sophocles
and
plato
and
seneca
and
the
glorious
examples
of
public
virtue
were
in
the
mouths
of
all
men
there
was
no
power
in
them
to
avert
the
doom
of
that
civilisation
for
which
the
blood
of
so
many
patriots
and
the
genius
of
such
incomparable
writers
had
been
wasted
in
vain
the
liberties
of
the
ancient
nations
were
crushed
beneath
a
hopeless
and
inevitable
despotism
and
their
vitality
was
spent
when
the
new
power
came
forth
from
galilee
giving
what
was
wanting
to
the
efficacy
of
human
knowledge
to
redeem
societies
as
well
as
men
it
would
be
presumptuous
if
i
attempted
to
indicate
the
numberless
channels
by
which
christian
influence
gradually
penetrated
the
state
the
first
striking
phenomenon
is
the
slowness
with
which
an
action
destined
to
be
so
prodigious
became
manifest
going
forth
to
all
nations
in
many
stages
of
civilisation
and
under
almost
every
form
of
government
christianity
had
none
of
the
character
of
a
political
apostolate
and
in
its
absorbing
mission
to
individuals
did
not
challenge
public
authority
the
early
christians
avoided
contact
with
the
state
abstained
from
the
responsibilities
of
office
and
were
even
reluctant
to
serve
in
the
army
cherishing
their
citizenship
of
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
they
despaired
of
an
empire
which
seemed
too
powerful
to
be
resisted
and
too
corrupt
to
be
converted
whose
institutions
the
work
and
the
pride
of
untold
centuries
of
paganism
drew
their
sanctions
from
the
gods
whom
the
christians
accounted
devils
which
plunged
its
hands
from
age
to
age
in
the
blood
of
martyrs
and
was
beyond
the
hope
of
regeneration
and
foredoomed
to
perish
they
were
so
much
overawed
as
to
imagine
that
the
fall
of
the
state
would
be
the
end
of
the
church
and
of
the
world
and
no
man
dreamed
of
the
boundless
future
of
spiritual
and
social
influence
that
awaited
their
religion
among
the
race
of
destroyers
that
were
bringing
the
empire
of
augustus
and
of
constantine
to
humiliation
and
ruin
the
duties
of
government
were
less
in
their
thoughts
than
the
private
virtues
and
duties
of
subjects
and
it
was
long
before
they
became
aware
of
the
burden
of
power
in
their
faith
down
almost
to
the
time
of
chrysostom
they
shrank
from
contemplating
the
obligation
to
emancipate
the
slaves
although
the
doctrine
of
and
which
is
the
foundation
of
political
economy
was
written
as
legibly
in
the
new
testament
as
in
the
of
it
was
not
recognised

are

but
yet
pregnant
sense
divines

century
insist
on
liberty
and
divines
of

fourth
century
on
equality
there
was
one
essential
and
inevitable
transformation
in
politics
popular
governments
had
existed
and
also
mixed
and
federal
governments
but
there
had
been
no
limited
government
no
state
the
circumference
of
whose
authority
had
been
defined
by
a
force
external
to
its
own
that
was
the
great
problem
which
philosophy
had
raised
and
which
no
statesmanship
had
been
able
to
solve
those
who
proclaimed
the
assistance
of
a
higher
authority
had
indeed
drawn
a
metaphysical
barrier
before
the
governments
but
they
had
not
known
how

make
it
real

socrates
could
effect
by
way

protest

reformed

the
stoics
could
only
advise
the
wise
man
to
hold
aloof
from
politics
keeping
the
unwritten
law
in
his
heart
but
when
christ
said
render
unto
cæsar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
and
unto
god
the
things
that
are
god
those
words
spoken
on
his
last
visit
to
the
temple
three
days
before
his
death
gave
to
the
civil
power
under
the
protection

a
sacredness
it
had
never
enjoyed
and
bounds
it
had
never
acknowledged
and
they
were
the
repudiation
of
absolutism
and
the
inauguration
of
freedom
for
our

not

execute
it
to
maintain
the
necessary
immunity
in

supreme
sphere
to
reduce
all
political
authority
within

set
up
in

come
from

which

raised

adopting
their

intended
neither
to
abandon
his
predecessor
scheme
of
policy
nor
to
renounce
the
fascinations
of
arbitrary
authority
but
to
strengthen
his
throne
with
the
support
of
a
religion
which
had
astonished
the
world
by
its
power
of
resistance
and
to
obtain
that
support
absolutely
and
without
a
drawback
he
fixed
the

of

warned
him
that
by
promoting

he
admitted

accepted

monarch
and
the
ablest
writer
of
the
empire
pointed
to
them
with
a
vague
and
bitter
feeling
that
to
the
institutions
of
these
barbarians
not
yet
crushed
by
despotism
the
future
of
the
world
belonged
their
kings
when
they
had
kings
did
not
preside
at
their
councils
they
were
sometimes
elective
they
were
sometimes
deposed
and
they
were
bound
by
oath
to
act
in
obedience
with
the
general
wish
they
enjoyed
real
authority
only
in
war
this
primitive
republicanism
which
admits
monarchy
as
an
occasional
incident
but
holds
fast
to
the
collective
supremacy
of
all
free
men
of
the
constituent
authority
over
all
constituted
authorities
is
the
remote
germ
of
parliamentary
government
the
action
of
the
state
was
confined
to
narrow
limits
but
besides
his
position
as
head
of
the
state
the
king
was
surrounded
by
a
body
of
followers
attached
to
him
by
personal
or
political
ties
in
these
his
immediate
dependants
disobedience
or
resistance
to
orders
was
no
more
tolerated
than
in
a
wife
a
child
or
a
soldier
and
a
man
was
expected
to
murder
his
own
father
if
his
chieftain
required
it
thus
these
teutonic
communities
admitted
an
independence
of
government
that
threatened
to
dissolve
society
and
a
dependence
on
persons
that
was
dangerous
to
freedom
it
was
a
system
very
favourable
to
corporations
but
offering
no
security
to
individuals
the
state
was
not
likely
to
oppress
its
subjects
and
was
not
able
to
protect
them
the
first
effect
of
the
great
teutonic
migration
into
the
regions
civilised
by
rome
was
to
throw
back
europe
many
centuries
to
a
condition
scarcely
more
advanced
than
that
from
which
the
institutions
of
solon
had
rescued
athens
whilst
the
greeks
preserved
the
literature
the
arts
and
the
science
of
antiquity
and
all
the
sacred
monuments
of
early
christianity
with
a
completeness
of
which
the
rended
fragments
that
have
come
down
to
us
give
no
commensurate
idea
and
even
the
peasants
of
bulgaria
knew
the
new
testament
by
heart
western
europe
lay
under
the
grasp
of
masters
the
ablest
of
whom
could
not
write
their
names
the
faculty
of
exact
reasoning
of
accurate
observation
became
extinct
for
five
hundred
years
and
even
the
sciences
most
needful
to
society
medicine
and
geometry
fell
into
decay
until
the
teachers
of
the
west
went
to
school
at
the
feet
of
arabian
masters
to
bring
order
out
of
chaotic
ruin
to
rear
a
new
civilisation
and
blend
hostile
and
unequal
races
into
a
nation
the
thing
wanted
was
not
liberty
but
force
and
for
centuries
all
progress
is
attached
to
the
action
of
men
like
clovis
charlemagne
and
william
the
norman
who
were
resolute
and
peremptory
and
prompt
to
be
obeyed
the
spirit
of
immemorial
paganism
which
had
saturated
ancient
society
could
not
be
exorcised
except
by
the
combined
influence
of
church
and
state
and
the
universal
sense
that
their
union
was
necessary
created
the
byzantine
despotism
the
divines
of
the
empire
who
could
not
fancy
christianity
flourishing
beyond
its
borders
insisted
that
the
state
is
not
in
the
church
but
the
church
in
the
state
this
doctrine
had
scarcely
been
uttered
when
the
rapid
collapse
of
the
western
empire
opened
a
wider
horizon
and
salvianus
a
priest
at
marseilles
proclaimed
that
the
social
virtues
which
were
decaying
amid
the
civilised
romans
existed
in
greater
purity
and
promise
among
the
pagan
invaders
they
were
converted
with
ease
and
rapidity
and
their
conversion
was
generally
brought
about
by
their
kings
christianity
which
in
earlier
times
had
addressed
itself
to
the
masses
and
relied
on
the
principle
of
liberty
now
made
its
appeal
to
the
rulers
and
threw
its
mighty
influence
into
the
scale
of
authority
the
barbarians
who
possessed
no
books
no
secular
knowledge
no
education
except
in
the
schools
of
the
clergy
and
who
had
scarcely
acquired
the
rudiments
of
religious
instruction
turned
with
childlike
attachment
to
men
whose
minds
were
stored
with
the
knowledge
of
scripture
of
cicero
of
augustine
and
in
the
scanty
world
of
their
ideas
the
church
was
felt
to
be
something
infinitely
vaster
stronger
holier
than
their
newly
founded
states
the
clergy
supplied
the
means
of
conducting
the
new
governments
and
were
made
exempt
from
taxation
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
magistrate
and
of
the
political
administrator
they
taught
that
power
ought
to
be
conferred
by
election
and
the
councils
of
toledo
furnished
the
framework
of
the
parliamentary
system
of
spain
which
is
by
a
long
interval
the
oldest
in
the
world
but
the
monarchy
of
the
goths
in
spain
as
well
as
that
of
the
saxons
in
england
in
both
of
which
the
nobles
and
the
prelates
surrounded
the
throne
with
the
semblance
of
free
institutions
passed
away
and
the
people
that
prospered
and
overshadowed
the
rest
were
the
franks
who
had
no
native
nobility
whose
law
of
succession
to
the
crown
became
for
one
thousand
years
the
fixed
object
of
an
unchanging
superstition
and
under
whom
the
feudal
system
was
developed
to
excess
feudalism
made
land
the
measure
and
the
master
of
all
things
having
no
other
source
of
wealth
than
the
produce
of
the
soil
men
depended
on
the
landlord
for
the
means
of
escaping
starvation
and
thus
his
power
became
paramount
over
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
the
authority
of
the
state
every
baron
said
the
french
maxim
is
sovereign
in
his
own
domain
the
nations
of
the
west
lay
between
the
competing
tyrannies
of
local
magnates
and
of
absolute
monarchs
when
a
force
was
brought
upon
the
scene
which
proved
for
a
time
superior
alike
to
the
vassal
and
his
lord
in
the
days
of
the
conquest
when
the
normans
destroyed
the
liberties
of
england
the
rude
institutions
which
had
come
with
the
saxons
the
goths
and
the
franks
from
the
forests
of
germany
were
suffering
decay
and
the
new
element
of
popular
government
afterwards
supplied
by
the
rise
of
towns
and
the
formation
of
a
middle
class
was
not
yet
active
the
only
influence
capable
of
resisting
the
feudal
hierarchy
was
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
and
they
came
into
collision
when
the
process
of
feudalism
threatened
the
independence
of
the
church
by
subjecting
the
prelates
severally
to
that
form
of
personal
dependence
on
the
kings
which
was
peculiar
to
the
teutonic
state
to
that
conflict
of
four
hundred
years
we
owe
the
rise
of
civil
liberty
if
the
church
had
continued
to
buttress
the
thrones
of
the
kings
whom
it
anointed
or
if
the
struggle
had
terminated
speedily
in
an
undivided
victory
all
europe
would
have
sunk
down
under
a
byzantine
or
muscovite
despotism
for
the
aim
of
both
contending
parties
was
absolute
authority
but
although
liberty
was
not
the
end
for
which
they
strove
it
was
the
means
by
which
the
temporal
and
the
spiritual
power
called
the
nations
to
their
aid
the
towns
of
italy
and
germany
won
their
franchises
france
got
her
and
england
her
parliament
out
of
the
alternate
phases
of
the
contest
and
as
long
as
it
lasted
it
prevented
the
rise
of
divine
right
a
disposition
existed
to
regard
the
crown
as
an
estate
descending
under
the
law
of
real
property
in
the
family
that
possessed
it
but
the
authority
of
religion
and
especially
of
the
papacy
was
thrown
on
the
side
that
denied
the
indefeasible
title
of
kings
in
france
what
was
afterwards
called
the
gallican
theory
maintained
that
the
reigning
house
was
above
the
law
and
that
the
sceptre
was
not
to
pass
away
from
it
as
long
as
there
should
be
princes
of
the
royal
blood
of
louis
but
in
other
countries
the
oath
of
fidelity
itself
attested
that
it
was
conditional
and
should
be
kept
only
during
good
behaviour
and
it
was
in
conformity
with
the
public
law
to
which
all
monarchs
were
held
subject
that
king
john
was
declared
a
rebel
against
the
barons
and
that
the
men
who
raised
edward
iii
to
the
throne
from
which
they
had
deposed
his
father
invoked
the
maxim
populi
vox
and
this
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
the
people
to
raise
up
and
pull
down
princes
after
obtaining
the
sanctions
of
religion
was
made
to
stand
on
broader
grounds
and
was
strong
enough
to
resist
both
church
and
king
in
the
struggle
between
the
house
of
bruce
and
the
house
of
plantagenet
for
the
possession
of
scotland
and
ireland
the
english
claim
was
backed
by
the
censures
of
rome
but
the
irish
and
the
scots
refused
it
and
the
address
in
which
the
scottish
parliament
informed
the
pope
of
their
resolution
shows
how
firmly
the
popular
doctrine
had
taken
root
speaking
of
robert
bruce
they
say
divine
providence
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
country
which
we
will
defend
till
death
and
the
choice
of
the
people
have
made
him
our
king
if
he
should
ever
betray
his
principles
and
consent
that
we
should
be
subjects
of
the
english
king
then
we
shall
treat
him
as
an
enemy
as
the
subverter
of
our
rights
and
his
own
and
shall
elect
another
in
his
place
we
care
not
for
glory
or
for
wealth
but
for
that
liberty
which
no
true
man
will
give
up
but
with
his
life
this
estimate
of
royalty
was
natural
among
men
accustomed
to
see
those
whom
they
most
respected
in
constant
strife
with
their
rulers
gregory
vii
had
begun
the
disparagement
of
civil
authorities
by
saying
that
they
are
the
work
of
the
devil
and
already
in
his
time
both
parties
were
driven
to
acknowledge
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
appealed
to
it
as
the
immediate
source
of
power
two
centuries
later
this
political
theory
had
gained
both
in
definiteness
and
in
force
among
the
guelphs
who
were
the
church
party
and
among
the
ghibellines
or
imperialists
here
are
the
sentiments
of
the
most
celebrated
of
all
the
guelphic
writers
a
king
who
is
unfaithful
to
his
duty
forfeits
his
claim
to
obedience
it
is
not
rebellion
to
depose
him
for
he
is
himself
a
rebel
whom
the
nation
has
a
right
to
put
down
but
it
is
better
to
abridge
his
power
that
he
may
be
unable
to
abuse
it
for
this
purpose
the
whole
nation
ought
to
have
a
share
in
governing
itself
the
constitution
ought
to
combine
a
limited
and
elective
monarchy
with
an
aristocracy
of
merit
and
such
an
admixture
of
democracy
as
shall
admit
all
classes
to
office
by
popular
election
no
government
has
a
right
to
levy
taxes
beyond
the
limit
determined
by
the
people
all
political
authority
is
derived
from
popular
suffrage
and
all
laws
must
be
made
by
the
people
or
their
representatives
there
is
no
security
for
us
as
long
as
we
depend
on
the
will
of
another
man
this
language
which
contains
the
earliest
exposition
of
the
whig
theory
of
the
revolution
is
taken
from
the
works
of
thomas
aquinas
of
whom
lord
bacon
says
that
he
had
the
largest
heart
of
the
school
divines
and
it
is
worth
while
to
observe
that
he
wrote
at
the
very
moment
when
simon
de
montfort
summoned
the
commons
and
that
the
politics
of
the
neapolitan
friar
are
centuries
in
advance
of
the
english
statesman
the
ablest
writer
of
the
ghibelline
party
was
marsilius
of
padua
laws
he
said
derive
their
authority
from
the
nation
and
are
invalid
without
its
assent
as
the
whole
is
greater
than
any
part
it
is
wrong
that
any
part
should
legislate
for
the
whole
and
as
men
are
equal
it
is
wrong
that
one
should
be
bound
by
laws
made
by
another
but
in
obeying
laws
to
which
all
men
have
agreed
all
men
in
reality
govern
themselves
the
monarch
who
is
instituted
by
the
legislature
to
execute
its
will
ought
to
be
armed
with
a
force
sufficient
to
coerce
individuals
but
not
sufficient
to
control
the
majority
of
the
people
he
is
responsible
to
the
nation
and
subject
to
the
law
and
the
nation
that
appoints
him
and
assigns
him
his
duties
has
to
see
that
he
obeys
the
constitution
and
has
to
dismiss
him
if
he
breaks
it
the
rights
of
citizens
are
independent
of
the
faith
they
profess
and
no
man
may
be
punished
for
his
religion
this
writer
who
saw
in
some
respects
farther
than
locke
or
montesquieu
who
in
regard
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
nation
representative
government
the
superiority
of
the
legislature
over
the
executive
and
the
liberty
of
conscience
had
so
firm
a
grasp
of
the
principles
that
were
to
sway
the
modern
world
lived
in
the
reign
of
edward
five
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
it
is
significant
that
these
two
writers
should
agree
on
so
many
of
the
fundamental
points
which
have
been
ever
since
the
topic
of
controversy
for
they
belonged
to
hostile
schools
and
one
of
them
would
have
thought
the
other
worthy
of
death
thomas
would
have
made
the
papacy
control
all
christian
governments
marsilius
would
have
had
the
clergy
submit
to
the
law
of
the
land
and
would
have
put
them
under
restrictions
both
as
to
property
and
numbers
as
the
great
debate
went
on
many
things
gradually
made
themselves
clear
and
grew
into
settled
convictions
for
these
were
not
only
the
thoughts
of
prophetic
minds
that
surpassed
the
level
of
contemporaries
there
was
some
prospect
that
they
would
master
the
practical
world
the
ancient
reign
of
the
barons
was
seriously
threatened
the
opening
of
the
east
by
the
crusades
had
imparted
a
great
stimulus
to
industry
a
stream
set
in
from
the
country
to
the
towns
and
there
was
no
room
for
the
government
of
towns
in
the
feudal
machinery
when
men
found
a
way
of
earning
a
livelihood
without
depending
for
it
on
the
good
will
of
the
class
that
owned
the
land
the
landowner
lost
much
of
his
importance
and
it
began
to
pass
to
the
possessors
of
moveable
wealth
the
townspeople
not
only
made
themselves
free
from
the
control
of
prelates
and
barons
but
endeavoured
to
obtain
for
their
own
class
and
interest
the
command
of
the
state
the
fourteenth
century
was
filled
with
the
tumult
of
this
struggle
between
democracy
and
chivalry
the
italian
towns
foremost
in
intelligence
and
civilisation
led
the
way
with
democratic
constitutions
of
an
ideal
and
generally
an
impracticable
type
the
swiss
cast
off
the
yoke
of
austria
two
long
chains
of
free
cities
arose
along
the
valley
of
the
rhine
and
across
the
heart
of
germany
the
citizens
of
paris
got
possession
of
the
king
reformed
the
state
and
began
their
tremendous
career
of
experiments
to
govern
france
but
the
most
healthy
and
vigorous
growth
of
municipal
liberties
was
in
belgium
of
all
countries
on
the
continent
that
which
has
been
from
immemorial
ages
the
most
stubborn
in
its
fidelity
to
the
principle
of
so
vast
were
the
resources
concentrated
in
the
flemish
towns
so
widespread
was
the
movement
of
democracy
that
it
was
long
doubtful
whether
the
new
interest
would
not
prevail
and
whether
the
ascendency
of
the
military
aristocracy
would
not
pass
over
to
the
wealth
and
intelligence
of
the
men
that
lived
by
trade
but
rienzi
marcel
artevelde
and
the
other
champions
of
the
unripe
democracy
of
those
days
lived
and
died
in
vain
the
upheaval
of
the
middle
class
had
disclosed
the
need
the
passions
the
aspirations
of
the
suffering
poor
below
ferocious
insurrections
in
france
and
england
caused
a
reaction
that
retarded
for
centuries
the
readjustment
of
power
and
the
red
spectre
of
social
revolution
arose
in
the
track
of
democracy
the
armed
citizens
of
ghent
were
crushed
by
the
french
chivalry
and
monarchy
alone
reaped
the
fruit
of
the
change
that
was
going
on
in
the
position
of
classes
and
stirred
the
minds
of
men
looking
back
over
the
space
of
a
thousand
years
which
we
call
the
middle
ages
to
get
an
estimate
of
the
work
they
had
done
if
not
towards
perfection
in
their
institutions
at
least
towards
attaining
the
knowledge
of
political
truth
this
is
what
we
find
representative
government
which
was
unknown
to
the
ancients
was
almost
universal
the
methods
of
election
were
crude
but
the
principle
that
no
tax
was
lawful
that
was
not
granted
by
the
class
that
paid

that
taxation

was
recognised
not
as
the
privilege
of

said
philip
de
commines

without

of

slavery
was
almost
everywhere
extinct
and
absolute
power
was
deemed
more
intolerable
and
more
criminal
than
slavery
the
right
of
insurrection
was
not
only
admitted
but
defined
as
a
duty
sanctioned
by
religion
even
the
principles
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
method
of
the
income
tax
were
already
known
the
issue
of
ancient
politics
was
an
absolute
state
planted
on
slavery
the
political
produce
of
the
middle
ages
was
a
system
of
states
in
which
authority
was
restricted
by
the
representation
of
powerful
classes
by
privileged
associations
and
by
the
acknowledgment
of
duties
superior
to
those
which
are
imposed
by
man
as
regards
the
realisation
in
practice
of
what
was
seen
to
be
good
there
was
almost
everything
to
do
but
the
great
problems
of
principle
had
been
solved
and
we
come
to
the
question
how
did
the
sixteenth
century
husband
the
treasure
which
the
middle
ages
had
stored
up
the
most
visible
sign
of
the
times
was
the
decline
of
the
religious
influence
that
had
reigned
so
long
sixty
years
passed
after
the
invention
of
printing
and
thirty
thousand
books
had
issued
from
european
presses
before
anybody
undertook
to
print
the
greek
testament
in
the
days
when
every
state
made
the
unity
of
faith
its
first
care
it
came
to
be
thought
that
the
rights
of
men
and
the
duties
of
neighbours
and
of
rulers
towards
them
varied
according
to
their
religion
and
society
did
not
acknowledge
the
same
obligations
to
a
turk
or
a
jew
a
pagan
or
a
heretic
or
a
devil
worshipper
as
to
an
orthodox
christian
as
the
ascendency
of
religion
grew
weaker
this
privilege
of
treating
its
enemies
on
exceptional
principles
was
claimed
by
the
state
for
its
own
benefit
and
the
idea
that
the
ends
of
government
justify
the
means
employed
was
worked
into
system
by
machiavelli
he
was
an
acute
politician
sincerely
anxious
that
the
obstacles
to
the
intelligent
government
of
italy
should
be
swept
away
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
most
vexatious
obstacle
to
intellect
is
conscience
and
that
the
vigorous
use
of
statecraft
necessary
for
the
success
of
difficult
schemes
would
never
be
made
if
governments
allowed
themselves
to
be
hampered
by
the
precepts
of
the
his
audacious
doctrine
was
avowed
in
the
succeeding
age
by
men
whose
personal
character
stood
high
they
saw
that
in
critical
times
good
men
have
seldom
strength
for
their
goodness
and
yield
to
those
who
have
grasped
the
meaning
of
the
maxim
that
you
can
not
make
an
omelette
if
you
are
afraid
to
break
the
eggs
they
saw
that
public
morality
differs
from
private
because
no
government
can
turn
the
other
cheek
or
can
admit
that
mercy
is
better
than
justice
and
they
could
not
define
the
difference
or
draw
the
limits
of
exception
or
tell
what
other
standard
for
a
nation
acts
there
is
than
the
judgment
which
heaven
pronounces
in
this
world
by
success
machiavelli
teaching
would
hardly
have
stood
the
test
of
parliamentary
government
for
public
discussion
demands
at
least
the
profession
of
good
faith
but
it
gave
an
immense
impulse
to
absolutism
by
silencing
the
consciences
of
very
religious
kings
and
made
the
good
and
the
bad
very
much
alike
charles

the
way
was
paved
for
absolute
monarchy
to
triumph
over
the
spirit
and
institutions
of
a
better
age
not
by
isolated
acts
of
wickedness
but
by
a
studied
philosophy
of
crime
and
so
thorough
a
perversion
of
the
moral
sense
that
the
like
of
it
had
not
been
since
the
stoics
reformed
the
morality
of
paganism
the
clergy
who
had
in
so
many
ways
served
the
cause
of
freedom
during
the
prolonged
strife
against
feudalism
and
slavery
were
associated
now
with
the
interest
of
royalty
attempts
had
been
made
to
reform
the
church
on
the
constitutional
model
they
had
failed
but
they
had
united
the
hierarchy
and
the
crown
against
the
system
of
divided
power
as
against
a
common
enemy
strong
kings
were
able
to
bring
the
spirituality
under
subjection
in
france
and
spain
in
sicily
and
in
england
the
absolute
monarchy
of
france
was
built
up
in
the
two
following
centuries
by
twelve
political
cardinals
the
kings
of
spain
obtained
the
same
effect
almost
at
a
single
stroke
by
reviving
and
appropriating
to
their
own
use
the
tribunal
of
the
inquisition
which
had
been
growing
obsolete
but
now
served
to
arm
them
with
terrors
which
effectually
made
them
despotic
one
generation
beheld
the
change
all
over
europe
from
the
anarchy
of
the
days
of
the
roses
to
the
passionate
submission
the
gratified
acquiescence
in
tyranny
that
marks
the
reign
of
henry
viii
and
the
kings
of
his
time
the
tide
was
running
fast
when
the
reformation
began
at
wittenberg
and
it
was
to
be
expected
that
luther
influence
would
stem
the
flood
of
absolutism
for
he
was
confronted
everywhere
by
the
compact
alliance
of
the
church
with
the
state
and
great
part
of
his
country
was
governed
by
hostile
potentates
who
were
prelates
of
the
court
of
rome
he
had
indeed
more
to
fear
from
temporal
than
from
spiritual
foes
the
leading
german
bishops
wished
that
the
protestant
demands
should
be
conceded
and
the
pope
himself
vainly
urged
on
the
emperor
a
conciliatory
policy
but
charles
had
outlawed
luther
and
attempted
to
waylay
him
and
the
dukes
of
bavaria
were
active
in
beheading
and
burning
his
disciples
whilst
the
democracy
of
the
towns
generally
took
his
side
but
the
dread
of
revolution
was
the
deepest
of
his
political
sentiments
and
the
gloss
by
which
the
guelphic
divines
had
got
over
the
passive
obedience
of
the
apostolic
age
was
characteristic
of
that
mediæval
method
of
interpretation
which
he
rejected
he
swerved
for
a
moment
in
his
later
years
but
the
substance
of
his
political
teaching
was
eminently
conservative
the
lutheran
states
became
the
stronghold
of
rigid
immobility
and
lutheran
writers
constantly
condemned
the
democratic
literature
that
arose
in
the
second
age
of
the
reformation
for
the
swiss
reformers
were
bolder
than
the
germans
in
mixing
up
their
cause
with
politics
zurich
and
geneva
were
republics
and
the
spirit
of
their
governments
influenced
both
zwingli
and
calvin
zwingli
indeed
did
not
shrink
from
the
mediæval
doctrine
that
evil
magistrates
must
be
cashiered
but
he
was
killed
too
early
to
act
either
deeply
or
permanently
on
the
political
character
of
protestantism
calvin
although
a
republican
judged
that
the
people
are
unfit
to
govern
themselves
and
declared
the
popular
assembly
an
abuse
that
ought
to
be
abolished
he
desired
an
aristocracy
of
the
elect
armed
with
the
means
of
punishing
not
only
crime
but
vice
and
error
for
he
thought
that
the
severity
of
the
mediæval
laws
was
insufficient
for
the
need
of
the
times
and
he
favoured
the
most
irresistible
weapon
which
the
inquisitorial
procedure
put
into
the
hand
of
the
government
the
right
of
subjecting
prisoners
to
intolerable
torture
not
because
they
were
guilty
but
because
their
guilt
could
not
be
proved
his
teaching
though
not
calculated
to
promote
popular
institutions
was
so
adverse
to
the
authority
of
the
surrounding
monarchs
that
he
softened
down
the
expression
of
his
political
views
in
the
french
edition
of
his
the
direct
political
influence
of
the
reformation
effected
less
than
has
been
supposed
most
states
were
strong
enough
to
control
it
some
by
intense
exertion
shut
out
the
pouring
flood
others
with
consummate
skill
diverted
it
to
their
own
uses
the
polish
government
alone
at
that
time
left
it
to
its
course
scotland
was
the
only
kingdom
in
which
the
reformation
triumphed
over
the
resistance
of
the
state
and
ireland
was
the
only
instance
where
it
failed
in
spite
of
government
support
but
in
almost
every
other
case
both
the
princes
that
spread
their
canvas
to
the
gale
and
those
that
faced
it
employed
the
zeal
the
alarm
the
passions
it
aroused
as
instruments
for
the
increase
of
power
nations
eagerly
invested
their
rulers
with
every
prerogative
needed
to
preserve
their
faith
and
all
the
care
to
keep
church
and
state
asunder
and
to
prevent
the
confusion
of
their
powers
which
had
been
the
work
of
ages
was
renounced
in
the
intensity
of
the
crisis
atrocious
deeds
were
done
in
which
religious
passion
was
often
the
instrument
but
policy
was
the
motive
fanaticism
displays
itself
in
the
masses
but
the
masses
were
rarely
fanaticised
and
the
crimes
ascribed
to
it
were
commonly
due
to
the
calculations
of
dispassionate
politicians
when
the
king
of
france
undertook
to
kill
all
the
protestants
he
was
obliged
to
do
it
by
his
own
agents
it
was
nowhere
the
spontaneous
act
of
the
population
and
in
many
towns
and
in
entire
provinces
the
magistrates
refused
to
obey
the
motive
of
the
court
was
so
far
from
mere
fanaticism
that
the
queen
immediately
challenged
elizabeth
to
do
the
like
to
the
english
catholics
francis
and
henry
ii
sent
nearly
a
hundred
huguenots
to
the
stake
but
they
were
cordial
and
assiduous
promoters
of
the
protestant
religion
in
germany
sir
nicholas
bacon
was
one
of
the
ministers
who
suppressed
the
mass
in
england
yet
when
the
huguenot
refugees
came
over
he
liked
them
so
little
that
he
reminded
parliament
of
the
summary
way
in
which
henry
at
agincourt
dealt
with
the
frenchmen
who
fell
into
his
hands
john
knox
thought
that
every
catholic
in
scotland
ought
to
be
put
to
death
and
no
man
ever
had
disciples
of
a
sterner
or
more
relentless
temper
but
his
counsel
was
not
followed
all
through
the
religious
conflict
policy
kept
the
upper
hand
when
the
last
of
the
reformers
died
religion
instead
of
emancipating
the
nations
had
become
an
excuse
for
the
criminal
art
of
despots
calvin
preached
and
bellarmine
lectured
but
machiavelli
reigned
before
the
close
of
the
century
three
events
occurred
which
mark
the
beginning
of
a
momentous
change
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
convinced
the
bulk
of
calvinists
of
the
lawfulness
of
rebellion
against
tyrants
and
they
became
advocates
of
that
doctrine
in
which
the
bishop
of
winchester
had
led
the
way
and
which
knox
and
buchanan
had
received
through
their
master
at
paris
straight
from
the
mediæval
schools
adopted
out
of
aversion
to
the
king
of
france
it
was
soon
put
in
practice
against
the
king
of
spain
the
revolted
netherlands
by
a
solemn
act
deposed
philip
and
made
themselves
independent
under
the
prince
of
orange
who
had
been
and
continued
to
be
styled
his
lieutenant
their
example
was
important
not
only
because
subjects
of
one
religion
deposed
a
monarch
of
another
for
that
had
been
seen
in
scotland
but
because
moreover
it
put
a
republic
in
the
place
of
a
monarchy
and
forced
the
public
law
of
europe
to
recognise
the
accomplished
revolution
at
the
same
time
the
french
catholics
rising
against
henry
who
was
the
most
contemptible
of
tyrants
and
against
his
heir
henry
of
navarre
who
as
a
protestant
repelled
the
majority
of
the
nation
fought
for
the
same
principles
with
sword
and
pen
many
shelves
might
be
filled
with
the
books
which
came
out
in
their
defence
during
half
a
century
and
they
include
the
most
comprehensive
treatises
on
laws
ever
written
nearly
all
are
vitiated
by
the
defect
which
disfigured
political
literature
in
the
middle
ages
that
literature
as
i
have
tried
to
show
is
extremely
remarkable
and
its
services
in
aiding
human
progress
are
very
great
but
from
the
death
of
bernard
until
the
appearance
of
sir
thomas
more
there
was
hardly
a
writer
who
did
not
make
his
politics
subservient
to
the
interest
of
either
pope
or
king
and
those
who
came
after
the
reformation
were
always
thinking
of
laws
as
they
might
affect
catholics
or
protestants
knox
thundered
against
what
he
called
monstrous
regiment
of
because
the
queen
went
to
mass
and
mariana
praised
the
assassin
of
henry
iii
because
the
king
was
in
league
with
huguenots
for
the
belief
that
it
is
right
to
murder
tyrants
first
taught
among
christians
i
believe
by
john
of
salisbury
the
most
distinguished
english
writer
of
the
twelfth
century
and
confirmed
by
roger
bacon
the
most
celebrated
englishman
of
the
thirteenth
had
acquired
about
this
time
a
fatal
significance
nobody
sincerely
thought
of
politics
as
a
law
for
the
just
and
the
unjust
or
tried
to
find
out
a
set
of
principles
that
should
hold
good
alike
under
all
changes
of
religion
hooker
stands
almost
alone
among
the
works
i
am
speaking
of
and
is
still
read
with
admiration
by
every
thoughtful
man
as
the
earliest
and
one
of
the
finest
prose
classics
in
our
language
but
though
few
of
the
others
have
survived
they
contributed
to
hand
down
masculine
notions
of
limited
authority
and
conditional
obedience
from
the
epoch
of
theory
to
generations
of
free
men
even
the
coarse
violence
of
buchanan
and
boucher
was
a
link
in
the
chain
of
tradition
that
connects
the
hildebrandine
controversy
with
the
long
parliament
and
thomas
with
edmund
burke
that
men
should
understand
that
governments
do
not
exist
by
divine
right
and
that
arbitrary
government
is
the
violation
of
divine
right
was
no
doubt
the
medicine
suited
to
the
malady
under
which
europe
languished
but
although
the
knowledge
of
this
truth
might
become
an
element
of
salutary
destruction
it
could
give
little
aid
to
progress
and
reform
resistance
to
tyranny
implied
no
faculty
of
constructing
a
legal
government
in
its
place
tyburn
tree
may
be
a
useful
thing
but
it
is
better
still
that
the
offender
should
live
for
repentance
and
reformation
the
principles
which
discriminate
in
politics
between
good
and
evil
and
make
states
worthy
to
last
were
not
yet
found
the
french
philosopher
charron
was
one
of
the
men
least
demoralised
by
party
spirit
and
least
blinded
by
zeal
for
a
cause
in
a
passage
almost
literally
taken
from
thomas
he
describes
our
subordination
under
a
law
of
nature
to
which
all
legislation
must
conform
and
he
ascertains
it
not
by
the
light
of
revealed
religion
but
by
the
voice
of
universal
reason
through
which
god
enlightens
the
consciences
of
men
upon
this
foundation
grotius
drew
the
lines
of
real
political
science
in
gathering
the
materials
of
international
law
he
had
to
go
beyond
national
treaties
and
denominational
interests
for
a
principle
embracing
all
mankind
the
principles
of
law
must
stand
he
said
even
if
we
suppose
that
there
is
no
god
by
these
inaccurate
terms
he
meant
that
they
must
be
found
independently
of
revelation
from
that
time
it
became
possible
to
make
politics
a
matter
of
principle
and
of
conscience
so
that
men
and
nations
differing
in
all
other
things
could
live
in
peace
together
under
the
sanctions
of
a
common
law
grotius
himself
used
his
discovery
to
little
purpose
as
he
deprived
it
of
immediate
effect
by
admitting
that
the
right
to
reign
may
be
enjoyed
as
a
freehold
subject
to
no
conditions
when
cumberland
and
pufendorf
unfolded
the
true
significance
of
his
doctrine
every
settled
authority
every
triumphant
interest
recoiled
aghast
none
were
willing
to
surrender
advantages
won
by
force
or
skill
because
they
might
be
in
contradiction
not
with
the
ten
commandments
but
with
an
unknown
code
which
grotius
himself
had
not
attempted
to
draw
up
and
touching
which
no
two
philosophers
agreed
it
was
manifest
that
all
persons
who
had
learned
that
political
science
is
an
affair
of
conscience
rather
than
of
might
or
expediency
must
regard
their
adversaries
as
men
without
principle
that
the
controversy
between
them
would
perpetually
involve
morality
and
could
not
be
governed
by
the
plea
of
good
intentions
which
softens
down
the
asperities
of
religious
strife
nearly
all
the
greatest
men
of
the
seventeenth
century

he
candidly
avows
that
kings
are
no
more
bound
by
the
terms
of
a
treaty
than
by

that
there
is
nothing
in

the

took
his
advice

retained
all
the
old
taxes
whilst
he
imposed

french
historians
believe
that
in

six
millions
of

died

it
would
be
easy
to
find

more
violent

there
was
not

the

with

of

the
lowest
depth
to
which
the
turpitude
of

has
ever
degraded
the

of

the

of
that

were
for

so
governed
as
to
reconcile

with
the
less
opprobrious
vices
of

poland
was
a
state
made
up
of
centrifugal
forces
what
the

called
liberty
was
the

to
persecute
the

infernal

venice
suffered
from
the
opposite
evil
of
excessive
concentration
it
was
the
most
sagacious
of
governments

rarely
have

mistakes
if
it
had
not
imputed
to

motives
as
wise
as
its

had
taken
account
of

of

it

little
cognisance

the

passed

ten
from

in

a
frightful
despotism

have
shown
you
how
machiavelli
supplied
the
immoral
theory
needful
for

consummation
of

the

required
the

assurance
against
the
revolt

it
was
provided
by
a
writer
as
able

analysed
the

made
known
that
its

security
is
poison

late
as

the

especially
geneva

they

that

to
the

alone
among

went
out
in
the
year
in
which
james

became

the
protestant
refugees
did
what
their
ancestors
had
done
a
century
before
they
asserted
the
deposing
power
of
subjects
over
rulers
who
had
broken
the
original
contract
between
them
and
all
the
powers
excepting
france
countenanced
their
argument
and
sent
forth
william
of
orange
on
that
expedition
which
was
the
faint
dawn
of
a
brighter
day
it
is
to
this
unexampled
combination
of
things
on
the
continent
more
than
to
her
own
energy
that
england
owes
her
deliverance
the
efforts
made
by
the
scots
by
the
irish
and
at
last
by
the
long
parliament
to
get
rid
of
the
misrule
of
the
stuarts
had
been
foiled
not
by
the
resistance
of
monarchy
but
by
the
helplessness
of
the
republic
state
and
church
were
swept
away
new
institutions
were
raised
up
under
the
ablest
ruler
that
had
ever
sprung
from
a
revolution
and
england
seething
with
the
toil
of
political
thought
had
produced
at
least
two
writers
who
in
many
directions
saw
as
far
and
as
clearly
as
we
do
now
but
cromwell
constitution
was
rolled
up
like
a
scroll
harrington
and
lilburne
were
laughed
at
for
a
time
and
forgotten
the
country
confessed
the
failure
of
its
striving
disavowed
its
aims
and
flung
itself
with
enthusiasm
and
without
any
effective
stipulations
at
the
feet
of
a
worthless
king
if
the
people
of
england
had
accomplished
no
more
than
this
to
relieve
mankind
from
the
pervading
pressure
of
unlimited
monarchy
they
would
have
done
more
harm
than
good
by
the
fanatical
treachery
with
which
violating
the
parliament
and
the
law
they
contrived
the
death
of
king
charles
by
the
ribaldry
of
the
latin
pamphlet
with
which
milton
justified
the
act
before
the
world
by
persuading
the
world
that
the
republicans
were
hostile
alike
to
liberty
and
to
authority
and
did
not
believe
in
themselves
they
gave
strength
and
reason
to
the
current
of
royalism
which
at
the
restoration
overwhelmed
their
work
if
there
had
been
nothing
to
make
up
for
this
defect
of
certainty
and
of
constancy
in
politics
england
would
have
gone
the
way
of
other
nations
at
that
time
there
was
some
truth
in
the
old
joke
which
describes
the
english
dislike
of
speculation
by
saying
that
all
our
philosophy
consists
of
a
short
catechism
in
two
questions
what
is
mind
no
matter
what
is
matter
never
mind
the
only
accepted
appeal
was
to
tradition
patriots
were
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
they
took
their
stand
upon
the
ancient
ways
and
would
not
have
the
laws
of
england
changed
to
enforce
their
argument
they
invented
a
story
that
the
constitution
had
come
from
troy
and
that
the
romans
had
allowed
it
to
subsist
untouched
such
fables
did
not
avail
against
strafford
and
the
oracle
of
precedent
sometimes
gave
responses
adverse
to
the
popular
cause
in
the
sovereign
question
of
religion
this
was
decisive
for
the
practice
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
well
as
of
the
fifteenth
testified
in
favour
of
intolerance
by
royal
command
the
nation
had
passed
four
times
in
one
generation
from
one
faith
to
another
with
a
facility
that
made
a
fatal
impression
on
laud
in
a
country
that
had
proscribed
every
religion
in
turn
and
had
submitted
to
such
a
variety
of
penal
measures
against
lollard
and
arian
against
augsburg
and
rome
it
seemed
there
could
be
no
danger
in
cropping
the
ears
of
a
puritan
but
an
age
of
stronger
conviction
had
arrived
and
men
resolved
to
abandon
the
ancient
ways
that
led
to
the
scaffold
and
the
rack
and
to
make
the
wisdom
of
their
ancestors
and
the
statutes
of
the
land
bow
before
an
unwritten
law
religious
liberty
had
been
the
dream
of
great
christian
writers
in
the
age
of
constantine
and
valentinian
a
dream
never
wholly
realised
in
the
empire
and
rudely
dispelled
when
the
barbarians
found
that
it
exceeded
the
resources
of
their
art
to
govern
civilised
populations
of
another
religion
and
unity
of
worship
was
imposed
by
laws
of
blood
and
by
theories
more
cruel
than
the
laws
but
from
athanasius
and
ambrose
down
to
erasmus
and
more
each
age
heard
the
protest
of
earnest
men
in
behalf
of
the
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
peaceful
days
before
the
reformation
were
full
of
promise
that
it
would
prevail
in
the
commotion
that
followed
men
were
glad
to
get
tolerated
themselves
by
way
of
privilege
and
compromise
and
willingly
renounced
the
wider
application
of
the
principle
socinus
was
the
first
who
on
the
ground
that
church
and
state
ought
to
be
separated
required
universal
toleration
but
socinus
disarmed
his
own
theory
for
he
was
a
strict
advocate
of
passive
obedience
the
idea
that
religious
liberty
is
the
generating
principle
of
civil
and
that
civil
liberty
is
the
necessary
condition
of
religious
was
a
discovery
reserved
for
the
seventeenth
century
many
years
before
the
names
of
milton
and
taylor
of
baxter
and
locke
were
made
illustrious
by
their
partial
condemnation
of
intolerance
there
were
men
among
the
independent
congregations
who
grasped
with
vigour
and
sincerity
the
principle
that
it
is
only
by
abridging
the
authority
of
states
that
the
liberty
of
churches
can
be
assured
that
great
political
idea
sanctifying
freedom
and
consecrating
it
to
god
teaching
men
to
treasure
the
liberties
of
others
as
their
own
and
to
defend
them
for
the
love
of
justice
and
charity
more
than
as
a
claim
of
right
has
been
the
soul
of
what
is
great
and
good
in
the
progress
of
the
last
two
hundred
years
the
cause
of
religion
even
under
the
unregenerate
influence
of
worldly
passion
had
as
much
to
do
as
any
clear
notions
of
policy
in
making
this
country
the
foremost
of
the
free
it
had
been
the
deepest
current
in
the
movement
of
and
it
remained
the
strongest
motive
that
survived
the
reaction
of
the
greatest
writers
of
the
whig
party
burke
and
macaulay
constantly
represented
the
statesmen
of
the
revolution
as
the
legitimate
ancestors
of
modern
liberty
it
is
humiliating
to
trace
a
political
lineage
to
algernon
sidney
who
was
the
paid
agent
of
the
french
king
to
lord
russell
who
opposed
religious
toleration
at
least
as
much
as
absolute
monarchy
to
shaftesbury
who
dipped
his
hands
in
the
innocent
blood
shed
by
the
perjury
of
titus
oates
to
halifax
who
insisted
that
the
plot
must
be
supported
even
if
untrue
to
marlborough
who
sent
his
comrades
to
perish
on
an
expedition
which
he
had
betrayed
to
the
french
to
locke
whose
notion
of
liberty
involves
nothing
more
spiritual
than
the
security
of
property
and
is
consistent
with
slavery
and
persecution
or
even
to
addison
who
conceived
that
the
right
of
voting
taxes
belonged
to
no
country
but
his
own
defoe
affirms
that
from
the
time
of
charles
ii
to
that
of
george
he
never
knew
a
politician
who
truly
held
the
faith
of
either
party
and
the
perversity
of
the
statesmen
who
led
the
assault
against
the
later
stuarts
threw
back
the
cause
of
progress
for
a
century
when
the
purport
of
the
secret
treaty
became
suspected
by
which
louis
xiv
pledged
himself
to
support
charles
ii
with
an
army
for
the
destruction
of
parliament
if
charles
would
overthrow
the
anglican
church
it
was
found
necessary
to
make
concession
to
the
popular
alarm
it
was
proposed
that
whenever
james
should
succeed
great
part
of
the
royal
prerogative
and
patronage
should
be
transferred
to
parliament
at
the
same
time
the
disabilities
of
nonconformists
and
catholics
would
have
been
removed
if
the
limitation
bill
which
halifax
supported
with
signal
ability
had
passed
the
monarchical
constitution
would
have
advanced
in
the
seventeenth
century
farther
than
it
was
destined
to
do
until
the
second
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
but
the
enemies
of
james
guided
by
the
prince
of
orange
preferred
a
protestant
king
who
should
be
nearly
absolute
to
a
constitutional
king
who
should
be
a
catholic
the
scheme
failed
james
succeeded
to
a
power
which
in
more
cautious
hands
would
have
been
practically
uncontrolled
and
the
storm
that
cast
him
down
gathered
beyond
the
sea
by
arresting
the
preponderance
of
france
the
revolution
of
struck
the
first
real
blow
at
continental
despotism
at
home
it
relieved
dissent
purified
justice
developed
the
national
energies
and
resources
and
ultimately
by
the
act
of
settlement
placed
the
crown
in
the
gift
of
the
people
but
it
neither
introduced
nor
determined
any
important
principle
and
that
both
parties
might
be
able
to
work
together
it
left
untouched
the
fundamental
question
between
whig
and
tory
for
the
divine
right
of
kings
it
established
in
the
words
of
defoe
the
divine
right
of
freeholders
and
their
domination
extended
for
seventy
years
under
the
authority
of
john
locke
the
philosopher
of
government
by
the
gentry
even
hume
did
not
enlarge
the
bounds
of
his
ideas
and
his
narrow
materialistic
belief
in
the
connection
between
liberty
and
property
captivated
even
the
bolder
mind
of
fox
by
his
idea
that
the
powers
of
government
ought
to
be
divided
according
to
their
nature
and
not
according
to
the
division
of
classes
which
montesquieu
took
up
and
developed
with
consummate
talent
locke
is
the
originator
of
the
long
reign
of
english
institutions
in
foreign
lands
and
his
doctrine
of
resistance
or
as
he
finally
termed
it
the
appeal
to
heaven
ruled
the
judgment
of
chatham
at
a
moment
of
solemn
transition
in
the
history
of
the
world
our
parliamentary
system
managed
by
the
great
revolution
families
was
a
contrivance
by
which
electors
were
compelled
and
legislators
were
induced
to
vote
against
their
convictions
and
the
intimidation
of
the
constituencies
was
rewarded
by
the
corruption
of
their
representatives
about
the
year
things
had
been
brought
back
by
indirect
ways
nearly
to
the
condition
which
the
revolution
had
been
designed
to
remedy
for
ever
europe
seemed
incapable
of
becoming
the
home
of
free
states
it
was
from
america
that
the
plain
ideas
that
men
ought
to
mind
their
own
business
and
that
the
nation
is
responsible
to
heaven
for
the
acts
of
the
state
ideas
long
locked
in
the
breast
of
solitary
thinkers
and
hidden
among
latin
folios
burst
forth
like
a
conqueror
upon
the
world
they
were
destined
to
transform
under
the
title
of
the
rights
of
man
whether
the
british
legislature
had
a
constitutional
right
to
tax
a
subject
colony
was
hard
to
say
by
the
letter
of
the
law
the
general
presumption
was
immense
on
the
side
of
authority
and
the
world
believed
that
the
will
of
the
constituted
ruler
ought
to
be
supreme
and
not
the
will
of
the
subject
people
very
few
bold
writers
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
lawful
power
may
be
resisted
in
cases
of
extreme
necessity
but
the
colonisers
of
america
who
had
gone
forth
not
in
search
of
gain
but
to
escape
from
laws
under
which
other
englishmen
were
content
to
live
were
so
sensitive
even
to
appearances
that
the
blue
laws
of
connecticut
forbade
men
to
walk
to
church
within
ten
feet
of
their
wives
and
the
proposed
tax
of
only
a
year
might
have
been
easily
borne
but
the
reasons
why
edward
and
his
council
were
not
allowed
to
tax
england
were
reasons
why
george
iii
and
his
parliament
should
not
tax
america
the
dispute
involved
a
principle
namely
the
right
of
controlling
government
furthermore
it
involved
the
conclusion
that
the
parliament
brought
together
by
a
derisive
election
had
no
just
right
over
the
unrepresented
nation
and
it
called
on
the
people
of
england
to
take
back
its
power
our
best
statesmen
saw
that
whatever
might
be
the
law
the
rights
of
the
nation
were
at
stake
chatham
in
speeches
better
remembered
than
any
that
have
been
delivered
in
parliament
exhorted
america
to
be
firm
lord
camden
the
late
chancellor
said
taxation
and
representation
are
inseparably
united
god
hath
joined
them
no
british
parliament
can
separate
them
from
the
elements
of
that
crisis
burke
built
up
the
noblest
political
philosophy
in
the
world
i
do
not
know
the
method
said
he
of
drawing
up
an
indictment
against
a
whole
people
the
natural
rights
of
mankind
are
indeed
sacred
things
and
if
any
public
measure
is
proved
mischievously
to
affect
them
the
objection
ought
to
be
fatal
to
that
measure
even
if
no
charter
at
all
could
be
set
up
against
it
only
a
sovereign
reason
paramount
to
all
forms
of
legislation
and
administration
should
dictate
in
this
way
just
a
hundred
years
ago
the
opportune
reticence
the
politic
hesitancy
of
european
statesmanship
was
at
last
broken
down
and
the
principle
gained
ground
that
a
nation
can
never
abandon
its
fate
to
an
authority
it
can
not
control
the
americans
placed
it
at
the
foundation
of
their
new
government
they
did
more
for
having
subjected
all
civil
authorities
to
the
popular
will
they
surrounded
the
popular
will
with
restrictions
that
the
british
legislature
would
not
endure
during
the
revolution
in
france
the
example
of
england
which
had
been
held
up
so
long
could
not
for
a
moment
compete
with
the
influence
of
a
country
whose
institutions
were
so
wisely
framed
to
protect
freedom
even
against
the
perils
of
democracy
when
louis
philippe
became
king
he
assured
the
old
republican
lafayette
that
what
he
had
seen
in
the
united
states
had
convinced
him
that
no
government
can
be
so
good
as
a
republic
there
was
a
time
in
the
presidency
of
monroe
about
years
ago
which
men
still
speak
of
as
the
era
of
good
feeling
when
most
of
the
incongruities
that
had
come
down
from
the
stuarts
had
been
reformed
and
the
motives
of
later
divisions
were
yet
inactive
the
causes
of
trouble
popular
ignorance
pauperism
the
glaring
contrast
between
rich
and
poor
religious
strife
public
debts
standing
armies
and
war
were
almost
unknown
no
other
age
or
country
had
solved
so
successfully
the
problems
that
attend
the
growth
of
free
societies
and
time
was
to
bring
no
further
progress
but
i
have
reached
the
end
of
my
time
and
have
hardly
come
to
the
beginning
of
my
task
in
the
ages
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
history
of
freedom
was
the
history
of
the
thing
that
was
not
but
since
the
declaration
of
independence
or
to
speak
more
justly
since
the
spaniards
deprived
of
their
king
made
a
new
government
for
themselves
the
only
known
forms
of
liberty
republics
and
constitutional
monarchy
have
made
their
way
over
the
world
it
would
have
been
interesting
to
trace
the
reaction
of
america
on
the
monarchies
that
achieved
its
independence
to
see
how
the
sudden
rise
of
political
economy
suggested
the
idea
of
applying
the
methods
of
science
to
the
art
of
government
how
louis
after
confessing
that
despotism
was
useless
even
to
make
men
happy
by
compulsion
appealed
to
the
nation
to
do
what
was
beyond
his
skill
and
thereby
resigned
his
sceptre
to
the
middle
class
and
the
intelligent
men
of
france
shuddering
at
the
awful
recollections
of
their
own
experience
struggled
to
shut
out
the
past
that
they
might
deliver
their
children
from
the
prince
of
the
world
and
rescue
the
living
from
the
clutch
of
the
dead
until
the
finest
opportunity
ever
given
to
the
world
was
thrown
away
because
the
passion
for
equality
made
vain
the
hope
of
freedom
and
i
should
have
wished
to
show
you
that
the
same
deliberate
rejection
of
the
moral
code
which
smoothed
the
paths
of
absolute
monarchy
and
of
oligarchy
signalised
the
advent
of
the
democratic
claim
to
unlimited
power
that
one
of
its
leading
champions
avowed
the
design
of
corrupting
the
moral
sense
of
men
in
order
to
destroy
the
influence
of
religion
and
a
famous
apostle
of
enlightenment
and
toleration
wished
that
the
last
king
might
be
strangled
with
the
entrails
of
the
last
priest
i
would
have
tried
to
explain
the
connection
between
the
doctrine
of
adam
smith
that
labour
is
the
original
source
of
all
wealth
and
the
conclusion
that
the
producers
of
wealth
virtually
compose
the
nation
by
which
sieyès
subverted
historic
france
and
to
show
that
rousseau
definition
of
the
social
compact
as
a
voluntary
association
of
equal
partners
conducted
marat
by
short
and
unavoidable
stages
to
declare
that
the
poorer
classes
were
absolved
by
the
law
of
from
the
conditions
of
a
contract
which
awarded
to
them
misery
and
death
that
they
were
at
war
with
society
and
had
a
right
to
all
they
could
get
by
exterminating
the
rich
and
that
their
inflexible
theory
of
equality
the
chief
legacy
of
the
revolution
together
with
the
avowed
inadequacy
of
economic
science
to
grapple
with
problems
of
the
poor
revived
the
idea
of
renovating
society
on
the
principle
of
which
had
been
the
generous
aspiration
of
the
essenes
and
the
early
christians
of
fathers
and
canonists
and
friars
of
erasmus
the
most
celebrated
precursor
of
the
reformation
of
sir
thomas
more
its
most
illustrious
victim
and
of
fénelon
the
most
popular
of
bishops
but
which
during
the
forty
years
of
its
revival
has
been
associated
with
envy
and
hatred
and
bloodshed
and
is
now
the
most
dangerous
enemy
lurking
in
our
path
last
and
most
of
all
having
told
so
much
of
the
unwisdom
of
our
ancestors
having
exposed
the
sterility
of
the
convulsion
that
burned
what
they
adored
and
made
the
sins
of
the
republic
mount
up
as
high
as
those
of
the
monarchy
having
shown
that
legitimacy
which
repudiated
the
revolution
and
imperialism
which
crowned
it
were
but
disguises
of
the
same
element
of
violence
and
wrong
i
should
have
wished
in
order
that
my
address
might
not
break
off
without
a
meaning
or
a
moral
to
relate
by
whom
and
in
what
connection
the
true
law
of
the
formation
of
free
states
was
recognised
and
how
that
discovery
closely
akin
to
those
which
under
the
names
of
development
evolution
and
continuity
have
given
a
new
and
deeper
method
to
other
sciences
solved
the
ancient
problem
between
stability
and
change
and
determined
the
authority
of
tradition
on
the
progress
of
thought
how
that
theory
which
sir
james
mackintosh
expressed
by
saying
that
constitutions
are
not
made
but
grow
the
theory
that
custom
and
the
national
qualities
of
the
governed
and
not
the
will
of
the
government
are
the
makers
of
the
law
and
therefore
that
the
nation
which
is
the
source
of
its
own
organic
institutions
should
be
charged
with
the
perpetual
custody
of
their
integrity
and
with
the
duty
of
bringing
the
form
into
harmony
with
the
spirit
was
made
by
the
singular
of
the
purest
conservative
intellect
with
revolution
of
niebuhr
with
mazzini
to
yield
the
idea
of
nationality
which
far
more
than
the
idea
of
liberty
has
governed
the
movement
of
the
present
age
i
do
not
like
to
conclude
without
inviting
attention
to
the
impressive
fact
that
so
much
of
the
hard
fighting
the
thinking
the
enduring
that
has
contributed
to
the
deliverance
of
man
from
the
power
of
man
has
been
the
work
of
our
countrymen
and
of
their
descendants
in
other
lands
we
have
had
to
contend
as
much
as
any
people
against
monarchs
of
strong
will
and
of
resources
secured
by
their
foreign
possession
against
men
of
rare
capacity
against
whole
dynasties
of
born
tyrants
and
yet
that
proud
prerogative
stands
out
on
the
background
of
our
history
within
a
generation
of
the
conquest
the
normans
were
compelled
to
recognise
in
some
grudging
measure
the
claims
of
the
english
people
when
the
struggle
between
church
and
state
extended
to
england
our
churchmen
learned
to
associate
themselves
with
the
popular
cause
and
with
few
exceptions
neither
the
hierarchical
spirit
of
the
foreign
divines
nor
the
monarchical
bias
peculiar
to
the
french
characterised
the
writers
of
the
english
school
the
civil
law
transmitted
from
the
degenerate
empire
to
be
the
common
prop
of
absolute
power
was
excluded
from
england
the
canon
law
was
restrained
and
this
country
never
admitted
the
inquisition
nor
fully
accepted
the
use
of
torture
which
invested
continental
royalty
with
so
many
terrors
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
foreign
writers
acknowledged
our
superiority
and
pointed
to
these
causes
after
that
our
gentry
maintained
the
means
of
local
such
as
no
other
country
possessed
divisions
in
religion
forced
toleration
the
confusion
of
the
common
law
taught
the
people
that
their
best
safeguard
was
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
the
judges
all
these
explanations
lie
on
the
surface
and
are
as
visible
as
the
protecting
ocean
but
they
can
only
be
successive
effects
of
a
constant
cause
which
must
lie
in
the
same
native
qualities
of
perseverance
moderation
individuality
and
the
manly
sense
of
duty
which
give
to
the
english
race
its
supremacy
in
the
stern
art
of
labour
which
has
enabled
it
to
thrive
as
no
other
can
on
inhospitable
shores
and
which
although
no
great
people
has
less

the
bloodthirsty
craving
for
glory

sharp

sir
erskine
may
writes
for
all
who
take
their
stand
within
the
broad
lines
of
our
constitution
his
judgment
is
averse
from
extremes
he
turns
from
the
discussion
of
theories
and
examines
his
subject
by
the
daylight
of
institutions
believing
that
laws
depend
much
on
the
condition
of
society
and
little
on
notions
and
disputations
unsupported
by
reality
he
avows
his
disbelief
even
in
the
influence
of
locke
and
cares
little
to
inquire
how
much
owes
to
independency
or
equality
to
the
quakers
and
how
democracy
was
affected
by
the
doctrine
that
society
is
founded
on
contract
that
happiness
is
the
end
of
all
government
or
labour
the
only
source
of
wealth
and
for
this
reason
because
he
always
touches
ground
and
brings
to
bear
on
a
vast
array
of
sifted
fact
the
light
of
sound
sense
and
tried
experience
rather
than
dogmatic
precept
all
men
will
read
his
book
with
profit
and
almost
all
without
offence
although
he
does
not
insist
on
inculcating
a
moral
he
has
stated
in
his
introductory
pages
the
ideas
that
guide
him
and
indeed
the
reader
who
fails
to
recognise
the
lesson
of
the
book
in
every
chapter
will
read
in
vain
sir
erskine
may
is
persuaded
that
it
is
the
tendency
of
modern
progress
to
elevate
the
masses
of
the
people
to
increase
their
part
in
the
work
and
the
fruit
of
civilisation
in
comfort
and
education
in
and
independence
in
political
knowledge
and
power
taken
for
a
universal
law
of
history
this
would
be
as
visionary
as
certain
generalisations
of
montesquieu
and
tocqueville
but
with
the
necessary
restrictions
of
time
and
place
it
can
not
fairly
be
disputed
another
conclusion
supported
by
a
far
wider
induction
is
that
democracy
like
monarchy
is
salutary
within
limits
and
fatal
in
excess
that
it
is
the
truest
friend
of
freedom
or
its
most
unrelenting
foe
according
as
it
is
mixed
or
pure
and
this
ancient
and
elementary
truth
of
constitutional
government
is
enforced
with
every
variety
of
impressive
and
suggestive
illustration
from
the
time
of
the
patriarchs
down
to
the
revolution
which
in
converted
federal
switzerland
into
an
unqualified
democracy
governed
by
the
direct
voice
of
the
entire
people
the
effective
distinction
between
liberty
and
democracy
which
has
occupied
much
of
the
author
thoughts
can
not
be
too
strongly
drawn
slavery
has
been
so
often
associated
with
democracy
that
a
very
able
writer
pronounced
it
long
ago
essential
to
a
democratic
state
and
the
philosophers
of
the
southern
confederation
have
urged
the
theory
with
extreme
fervour
for
slavery
operates
like
a
restricted
franchise
attaches
power
to
property
and
hinders
socialism
the
infirmity
that
attends
mature
democracies
the
most
intelligent
of
greek
tyrants
periander
discouraged
the
employment
of
slaves
and
pericles
designates
the
freedom
from
manual
labour
as
the
distinguishing
prerogative
of
athens
at
rome
a
tax
on
manumissions
immediately
followed
the
establishment
of
political
equality
by
licinius
an
impeachment
of
england
for
having
imposed
slavery
on
america
was
carefully
expunged
from
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
french
assembly
having
proclaimed
the
rights
of
man
declared
that
they
did
not
extend
to
the
colonies
the
abolition
controversy
has
made
everybody
familiar
with
burke
saying
that
men
learn
the
price
of
freedom
by
being
masters
of
slaves
from
the
best
days
of
athens
the
days
of
anaxagoras
protagoras
and
socrates
a
strange
affinity
has
subsisted
between
democracy
and
religious
persecution
the
bloodiest
deed
committed
between
the
wars
of
religion
and
the
revolution
was
due
to
the
fanaticism
of
men
living
under
the
primitive
republic
in
the
rhætian
alps
and
of
six
democratic
cantons
only
one
tolerated
protestants
and
that
after
a
struggle
which
lasted
the
better
part
of
two
centuries
in
the
fifteen
catholic
provinces
would
have
joined
the
revolted
netherlands
but
for
the
furious
bigotry
of
ghent
and
the
democracy
of
friesland
was
the
most
intolerant
of
the
states
the
aristocratic
colonies
in
america
defended
toleration
against
their
democratic
neighbours
and
its
triumph
in
rhode
island
and
pennsylvania
was
the
work
not
of
policy
but
of
religion
the
french
republic
came
to
ruin
because
it
found
the
lesson
of
religious
liberty
too
hard
to
learn
down
to
the
eighteenth
century
indeed
it
was
understood
in
monarchies
more
often
than
in
free
commonwealths
richelieu
acknowledged
the
principle
whilst
he
was
constructing
the
despotism
of
the
bourbons
so
did
the
electors
of
brandenburg
at
the
time
when
they
made
themselves
absolute
and
after
the
fall
of
clarendon
the
notion
of
indulgence
was
inseparable
from
the
design
of
charles
ii
to
subvert
the
constitution
a
government
strong
enough
to
act
in
defiance
of
public
feeling
may
disregard
the
plausible
heresy
that
prevention
is
better
than
punishment
for
it
is
able
to
punish
but
a
government
entirely
dependent
on
opinion
looks
for
some
security
what
that
opinion
shall
be
strives
for
the
control
of
the
forces
that
shape
it
and
is
fearful
of
suffering
the
people
to
be
educated
in
sentiments
hostile
to
its
institutions
when
general
grant
attempted
to
grapple
with
polygamy
in
utah
it
was
found
necessary
to
pack
the
juries
with
gentiles
and
the
supreme
court
decided
that
the
proceedings
were
illegal
and
that
the
prisoners
must
be
set
free
even
the
murderer
lee
was
absolved
in
by
a
jury
of
mormons
modern
democracy
presents
many
problems
too
various
and
obscure
to
be
solved
without
a
larger
range
of
materials
than
tocqueville
obtained
from
his
american
authorities
or
his
own
observation
to
understand
why
the
hopes
and
the
fears
that
it
excites
have
been
always
inseparable
to
determine
under
what
conditions
it
advances
or
retards
the
progress
of
the
people
and
the
welfare
of
free
states
there
is
no
better
course
than
to
follow
sir
erskine
may
upon
the
road
which
he
has
been
the
first
to
open
in
the
midst
of
an
invincible
despotism
among
paternal
military
and
sacerdotal
monarchies
the
dawn
rises
with
the
deliverance
of
israel
out
of
bondage
and
with
the
covenant
which
began
their
political
life
the
tribes
broke
up
into
smaller
communities
administering
their
own
affairs
under
the
law
they
had
sworn
to
observe
but
which
there
was
no
civil
power
to
enforce
they
governed
themselves
without
a
central
authority
a
legislature
or
a
dominant
priesthood
and
this
polity
which
under
the
forms
of
primitive
society
realised
some
aspirations
of
developed
democracy
resisted
for
above
three
hundred
years
the
constant
peril
of
anarchy
and
subjugation
the
monarchy
itself
was
limited
by
the
same
absence
of
a
legislative
power
by
the
submission
of
the
king
to
the
law
that
bound
his
subjects
by
the
perpetual
appeal
of
prophets
to
the
conscience
of
the
people
as
its
appointed
guardian
and
by
the
ready
resource
of
deposition
later
still
in
the
decay
of
the
religious
and
national
constitution
the
same
ideas
appeared
with
intense
energy
in
an
extraordinary
association
of
men
who
lived
in
austerity
and
rejected
slavery
maintained
equality
and
held
their
property
in
common
and
who
constituted
in
miniature
an
almost
perfect
republic
but
the
essenes
perished
with
the
city
and
the
temple
and
for
many
ages
the
example
of
the
hebrews
was
more
serviceable
to
authority
than
to
freedom
after
the
reformation
the
sects
that
broke
resolutely
with
the
traditions
of
church
and
state
as
they
came
down
from
catholic
times
and
sought
for
their
new
institutions
a
higher
authority
than
custom
reverted
to
the
memory
of
a
commonwealth
founded
on
a
voluntary
contract
on
federalism
equality
in
which
election
was
preferred
to
inheritance
and
monarchy
was
an
emblem
of
the
heathen
and
they
conceived
that
there
was
no
better
model
for
themselves
than
a
nation
constituted
by
religion
owning
no
lawgiver
but
moses
and
obeying
no
king
but
god
political
thought
had
until
then
been
guided
by
pagan
experience
among
the
greeks
athens
the
boldest
pioneer
of
republican
discovery
was
the
only
democracy
that
prospered
it
underwent
the
changes
that
were
the
common
lot
of
greek
society
but
it
met
them
in
a
way
that
displayed
a
singular
genius
for
politics
the
struggle
of
competing
classes
for
supremacy
almost
everywhere
a
cause
of
oppression
and
bloodshed
became
with
them
a
genuine
struggle
for
freedom
and
the
athenian
constitution
grew
with
little
pressure
from
below
under
the
intelligent
action
of
statesmen
who
were
swayed
by
political
reasoning
more
than
by
public
opinion
they
avoided
violent
and
convulsive
change
because
the
rate
of
their
reforms
kept
ahead
of
the
popular
demand
solon
whose
laws
began
the
reign
of
mind
over
force
instituted
democracy
by
making
the
people
not
indeed
the
administrators
but
the
source
of
power
he
committed
the
government
not
to
rank
or
birth
but
to
land
and
he
regulated
the
political
influence
of
the
landowners
by
their
share
in
the
burdens
of
the
public
service
to
the
lower
class
who
neither
bore
arms
nor
paid
taxes
and
were
excluded
from
the
government
he
granted
the
privilege
of
choosing
and
of
calling
to
account
the
men
by
whom
they
were
governed
of
confirming
or
rejecting
the
acts
of
the
legislature
and
the
judgments
of
the
courts
although
he
charged
the
areopagus
with
the
preservation
of
his
laws
he
provided
that
they
might
be
revised
according
to
need
and
the
ideal
before
his
mind
was
government
by
all
free
citizens
his
concessions
to
the
popular
element
were
narrow
and
were
carefully
guarded
he
yielded
no
more
than
was
necessary
to
guarantee
the
attachment
of
the
whole
people
to
the
state
but
he
admitted
principles
that
went
further
than
the
claims
which
he
conceded
he
took
only
one
step
towards
democracy
but
it
was
the
first
of
a
series
when
the
persian
wars
which
converted
aristocratic
athens
into
a
maritime
state
had
developed
new
sources
of
wealth
and
a
new
description
of
interests
the
class
which
had
supplied
many
of
the
ships
and
most
of
the
men
that
had
saved
the
national
independence
and
founded
an
empire
could
not
be
excluded
from
power
solon
principle
that
political
influence
should
be
commensurate
with
political
service
broke
through
the
forms
in
which
he
had
confined
it
and
the
spirit
of
his
constitution
was
too
strong
for
the
letter
the
fourth
estate
was
admitted
to
office
and
in
order
that
its
candidates
might
obtain
their
share
and
no
more
than
their
share
and
that
neither
interest
nor
numbers
might
prevail
many
public
functionaries
were
appointed
by
lot
the
athenian
idea
of
a
republic
was
to
substitute
the
impersonal
supremacy
of
law
for
the
government
of
men
mediocrity
was
a
safeguard
against
the
pretensions
of
superior
capacity
for
the
established
order
was
in
danger
not
from
the
average
citizens
but
from
men
like
miltiades
of
exceptional
renown
the
people
of
athens
venerated
their
constitution
as
a
gift
of
the
gods
the
source
and
title
of
their
power
a
thing
too
sacred
for
wanton
change
they
had
demanded
a
code
that
the
unwritten
law
might
no
longer
be
interpreted
at
will
by
archons
and
areopagites
and
a
and
authoritative
legislation
was
a
triumph
of
the
democracy
so
well
was
this
conservative
spirit
understood
that
the
revolution
which
abolished
the
privileges
of
the
aristocracy
was
promoted
by
aristides
and
completed
by
pericles
men
free
from
the
reproach
of
flattering
the
multitude
they
associated
all
the
free
athenians
with
the
interest
of
the
state
and
called
them
without
distinction
of
class
to
administer
the
powers
that
belonged
to
them
solon
had
threatened
with
the
loss
of
citizenship
all
who
showed
themselves
indifferent
in
party
conflicts
and
pericles
declared
that
every
man
who
neglected
his
share
of
public
duty
was
a
useless
member
of
the
community
that
wealth
might
confer
no
unfair
advantage
that
the
poor
might
not
take
bribes
from
the
rich
he
took
them
into
the
pay
of
the
state
during
their
attendance
as
jurors
that
their
numbers
might
give
them
no
unjust
superiority
he
restricted
the
right
of
citizenship
to
those
who
came
from
athenian
parents
on
both
sides
and
thus
he
expelled
more
than
men
of
mixed
descent
from
the
assembly
this
bold
measure
which
was
made
acceptable
by
a
distribution
of
grain
from
egypt
among
those
who
proved
their
full
athenian
parentage
reduced
the
fourth
class
to
an
equality
with
the
owners
of
real
property
for
pericles
or
ephialtes
for
it
would
appear
that
all
their
reforms
had
been
carried
in
the
year
when
ephialtes
died
is
the
first
democratic
statesman
who
grasped
the
notion
of
political
equality
the
measures
which
made
all
citizens
equal
might
have
created
a
new
inequality
between
classes
and
the
artificial
privilege
of
land
might
have
been
succeeded
by
the
more
crushing
preponderance
of
numbers
but
pericles
held
it
to
be
intolerable
that
one
portion
of
the
people
should
be
required
to
obey
laws
which
others
have
the
exclusive
right
of
making
and
he
was
able
during
thirty
years
to
preserve
the
equipoise
governing
by
the
general
consent
of
the
community
formed
by
free
debate
he
made
the
undivided
people
sovereign
but
he
subjected
the
popular
initiative
to
a
court
of
revision
and
assigned
a
penalty
to
the
proposer
of
any
measure
which
should
be
found
to
be
unconstitutional
athens
under
pericles
was
the
most
successful
republic
that
existed
before
the
system
of
representation
but
its
splendour
ended
with
his
life
the
danger
to
liberty
from
the
predominance
either
of
privilege
or
majorities
was
so
manifest
that
an
idea
arose
that
equality
of
fortune
would
be
the
only
way
to
prevent
the
conflict
of
class
interests
the
philosophers
phaleas
plato
aristotle
suggested
various
expedients
to
level
the
difference
between
rich
and
poor
solon
had
endeavoured
to
check
the
increase
of
estates
and
pericles
had
not
only
strengthened
the
public
resources
by
bringing
the
rich
under
the
control
of
an
assembly
in
which
they
were
not
supreme
but
he
had
employed
those
resources
in
improving
the
condition
and
the
capacity
of
the
masses
the
grievance
of
those
who
were
taxed
for
the
benefit
of
others
was
easily
borne
so
long
as
the
tribute
of
the
confederates
filled
the
treasury
but
the
peloponnesian
war
increased
the
strain
on
the
revenue
and
deprived
athens
of
its
dependencies
the
balance
was
upset
and
the
policy
of
making
one
class
give
that
another
might
receive
was
recommended
not
only
by
the
interest
of
the
poor
but
by
a
growing
theory
that
wealth
and
poverty
make
bad
citizens
that
the
middle
class
is
the
one
most
easily
led
by
reason
and
that
the
way
to
make
it
predominate
is
to
depress
whatever
rises
above
the
common
level
and
to
raise
whatever
falls
below
it
this
theory
which
became
inseparable
from
democracy
and
contained
a
force
which
alone
seems
able
to
destroy
it
was
fatal
to
athens
for
it
drove
the
minority
to
treason
the
glory
of
the
athenian
democrats
is
not
that
they
escaped
the
worst
consequences
of
their
principle
but
that
having
twice
cast
out
the
usurping
oligarchy
they
set
bounds
to
their
own
power
they
forgave
their
vanquished
enemies
they
abolished
pay
for
attendance
in
the
assembly
they
established
the
supremacy
of
law
by
making
the
code
superior
to
the
people
they
distinguished
things
that
were
constitutional
from
things
that
were
legal
and
resolved
that
no
legislative
act
should
pass
until
it
had
been
pronounced
consistent
with
the
constitution
the
causes
which
ruined
the
republic
of
athens
illustrate
the
connection
of
ethics
with
politics
rather
than
the
vices
inherent
to
democracy
a
state
which
has
only
full
citizens
in
a
population
of
and
is
governed
practically
by
about
people
at
a
public
meeting
is
scarcely
democratic
the
short
triumph
of
athenian
liberty
and
its
quick
decline
belong
to
an
age
which
possessed
no
fixed
standard
of
right
and
wrong
an
unparalleled
activity
of
intellect
was
shaking
the
credit
of
the
gods
and
the
gods
were
the
givers
of
the
law
it
was
a
very
short
step
from
the
suspicion
of
protagoras
that
there
were
no
gods
to
the
assertion
of
critias
that
there
is
no
sanction
for
laws
if
nothing
was
certain
in
theology
there
was
no
certainty
in
ethics
and
no
moral
obligation
the
will
of
man
not
the
will
of
god
was
the
rule
of
life
and
every
man
and
body
of
men
had
the
right
to
do
what
they
had
the
means
of
doing
tyranny
was
no
wrong
and
it
was
hypocrisy
to
deny
oneself
the
enjoyment
it
affords
the
doctrine
of
the
sophists
gave
no
limits
to
power
and
no
security
to
freedom
it
inspired
that
cry
of
the
athenians
that
they
must
not
be
hindered
from
doing
what
they
pleased
and
the
speeches
of
men
like
athenagoras
and
euphemus
that
the
democracy
may
punish
men
who
have
done
no
wrong
and
that
nothing
that
is
profitable
is
amiss
and
socrates
perished
by
the
reaction
which
they
provoked
the
disciples
of
socrates
obtained
the
ear
of
posterity
their
testimony
against
the
government
that
put
the
best
of
citizens
to
death
is
enshrined
in
writings
that
compete
with
christianity
itself
for
influence
on
the
opinions
of
men
greece
has
governed
the
world
by
her
philosophy
and
the
loudest
note
in
greek
philosophy
is
the
protest
against
athenian
democracy
but
although
socrates
derided
the
practice
of
leaving
the
choice
of
magistrates
to
chance
and
plato
admired
the
bloodstained
tyrant
critias
and
aristotle
deemed
theramenes
a
greater
statesman
than
pericles
yet
these
are
the
men
who
laid
the
first
stones
of
a
purer
system
and
became
the
lawgivers
of
future
commonwealths
the
main
point
in
the
method
of
socrates
was
essentially
democratic
he
urged
men
to
bring
all
things
to
the
test
of
incessant
inquiry
and
not
to
content
themselves
with
the
verdict
of
authorities
majorities
or
custom
to
judge
of
right
and
wrong
not
by
the
will
or
sentiment
of
others
but
by
the
light
which
god
has
set
in
each
man
reason
and
conscience
he
proclaimed
that
authority
is
often
wrong
and
has
no
warrant
to
silence
or
to
impose
conviction
but
he
gave
no
warrant
to
resistance
he
emancipated
men
for
thought
but
not
for
action
the
sublime
history
of
his
death
shows
that
the
superstition
of
the
state
was
undisturbed
by
his
contempt
for
its
rulers
plato
had
not
his
master
patriotism
nor
his
reverence
for
the
civil
power
he
believed
that
no
state
can
command
obedience
if
it
does
not
deserve
respect
and
he
encouraged
citizens
to
despise
their
government
if
they
were
not
governed
by
wise
men
to
the
aristocracy
of
philosophers
he
assigned
a
boundless
prerogative
but
as
no
government
satisfied
that
test
his
plea
for
despotism
was
hypothetical
when
the
lapse
of
years
roused
him
from
the
fantastic
dream
of
his
republic
his
belief
in
divine
government
moderated
his
intolerance
of
human
freedom
plato
would
not
suffer
a
democratic
polity
but
he
challenged
all
existing
authorities
to
justify
themselves
before
a
superior
tribunal
he
desired
that
all
constitutions
should
be
thoroughly
remodelled
and
he
supplied
the
greatest
need
of
greek
democracy
the
conviction
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
subject
to
the
will
of
god
and
that
all
civil
authority
except
that
of
an
imaginary
state
is
limited
and
conditional
the
prodigious
vitality
of
his
writings
has
kept
the
glaring
perils
of
popular
government
constantly
before
mankind
but
it
has
also
preserved
the
belief
in
ideal
politics
and
the
notion
of
judging
the
powers
of
this
world
by
a
standard
from
heaven
there
has
been
no
fiercer
enemy
of
democracy
but
there
has
been
no
stronger
advocate
of
revolution
in
the
aristotle
condemns
democracy
even
with
a
property
qualification
as
the
worst
of
governments
but
near
the
end
of
his
life
when
he
composed
his
he
was
brought
grudgingly
to
make
a
memorable
concession
to
preserve
the
sovereignty
of
law
which
is
the
reason
and
the
custom
of
generations
and
to
restrict
the
realm
of
choice
and
change
he
conceived
it
best
that
no
class
of
society
should
preponderate
that
one
man
should
not
be
subject
to
another
that
all
should
command
and
all
obey
he
advised
that
power
should
be
distributed
to
high
and
low
to
the
first
according
to
their
property
to
the
others
according
to
numbers
and
that
it
should
centre
in
the
middle
class
if
aristocracy
and
democracy
were
fairly
combined
and
balanced
against
each
other
he
thought
that
none
would
be
interested
to
disturb
the
serene
majesty
of
impersonal
government
to
reconcile
the
two
principles
he
would
admit
even
the
poorer
citizens
to
office
and
pay
them
for
the
discharge
of
public
duties
but
he
would
compel
the
rich
to
take
their
share
and
would
appoint
magistrates
by
election
and
not
by
lot
in
his
indignation
at
the
extravagance
of
plato
and
his
sense
of
the
significance
of
facts
he
became
against
his
will
the
prophetic
exponent
of
a
limited
and
regenerated
democracy
but
the
which
to
the
world
of
living
men
is
the
most
valuable
of
his
works
acquired
no
influence
on
antiquity
and
is
never
quoted
before
the
time
of
cicero
again
it
disappeared
for
many
centuries
it
was
unknown
to
the
arabian
commentators
and
in
western
europe
it
was
first
brought
to
light
by
thomas
aquinas
at
the
very
time
when
an
infusion
of
popular
elements
was
modifying
feudalism
and
it
helped
to
emancipate
political
philosophy
from
despotic
theories
and
to
confirm
it
in
the
ways
of
freedom
the
three
generations
of
the
socratic
school
did
more
for
the
future
reign
of
the
people
than
all
the
institutions
of
the
states
of
greece
they
vindicated
conscience
against
authority
and
subjected
both
to
a
higher
law
and
they
proclaimed
that
doctrine
of
a
mixed
constitution
which
has
prevailed
at
last
over
absolute
monarchy
and
still
has
to
contend
against
extreme
republicans
and
socialists
and
against
the
masters
of
a
hundred
legions
but
their
views
of
liberty
were
based
on
expediency
not
on
justice
they
legislated
for
the
favoured
citizens
of
greece
and
were
conscious
of
no
principle
that
extended
the
same
rights
to
the
stranger
and
the
slave
that
discovery
without
which
all
political
science
was
merely
conventional
belongs
to
the
followers
of
zeno
the
dimness
and
poverty
of
their
theological
speculation
caused
the
stoics
to
attribute
the
government
of
the
universe
less
to
the
uncertain
design
of
gods
than
to
a
definite
law
of
nature
by
that
law
which
is
superior
to
religious
traditions
and
national
authorities
and
which
every
man
can
learn
from
a
guardian
angel
who
neither
sleeps
nor
errs
all
are
governed
alike
all
are
equal
all
are
bound
in
charity
to
each
other
as
members
of
one
community
and
children
of
the
same
god
the
unity
of
mankind
implied
the
existence
of
rights
and
duties
common
to
all
men
which
legislation
neither
gives
nor
takes
away
the
stoics
held
in
no
esteem
the
institutions
that
vary
with
time
and
place
and
their
ideal
society
resembled
a
universal
church
more
than
an
actual
state
in
every
collision
between
authority
and
conscience
they
preferred
the
inner
to
the
outer
guide
and
in
the
words
of
epictetus
regarded
the
laws
of
the
gods
not
the
wretched
laws
of
the
dead
their
doctrine
of
equality
of
fraternity
of
humanity
their
defence
of
individualism
against
public
authority
their
repudiation
of
slavery
redeemed
democracy
from
the
narrowness
the
want
of
principle
and
of
sympathy
which
are
its
reproach
among
the
greeks
in
practical
life
they
preferred
a
mixed
constitution
to
a
purely
popular
government
chrysippus
thought
it
impossible
to
please
both
gods
and
men
and
seneca
declared
that
the
people
is
corrupt
and
incapable
and
that
nothing
was
wanting
under
nero
to
the
fulness
of
liberty
except
the
possibility
of
destroying
it
but
their
lofty
conception
of
freedom
as
no
exceptional
privilege
but
the
birthright
of
mankind
survived
in
the
law
of
nations
and
purified
the
equity
of
rome
whilst
dorian
oligarchs
and
macedonian
kings
crushed
the
liberties
of
greece
the
roman
republic
was
ruined
not
by
its
enemies
for
there
was
no
enemy
it
did
not
conquer
but
by
its
own
vices
it
was
free
from
many
causes
of
instability
and
dissolution
that
were
active
in
greece
the
eager
quickness
the
philosophic
thought
the
independent
belief
the
pursuit
of
unsubstantial
grace
and
beauty
it
was
protected
by
many
subtle
contrivances
against
the
sovereignty
of
numbers
and
against
legislation
by
surprise
constitutional
battles
had
to
be
fought
over
and
over
again
and
progress
was
so
slow
that
reforms
were
often
voted
many
years
before
they
could
be
carried
into
effect
the
authority
allowed
to
fathers
to
masters
to
creditors
was
as
incompatible
with
the
spirit
of
freedom
as
the
practice
of
the
servile
east
the
roman
citizen
revelled
in
the
luxury
of
power
and
his
jealous
dread
of
every
change
that
might
impair
its
enjoyment
portended
a
gloomy
oligarchy
the
cause
which
transformed
the
domination
of
rigid
and
exclusive
patricians
into
the
model
republic
and
which
out
of
the
decomposed
republic
built
up
the
archetype
of
all
despotism
was
the
fact
that
the
roman
commonwealth
consisted
of
two
states
in
one
the
constitution
was
made
up
of
compromises
between
independent
bodies
and
the
obligation
of
observing
contracts
was
the
standing
security
for
freedom
the
plebs
obtained
and
an
equal
sovereignty
by
the
aid
of
the
tribunes
of
the
people
the
peculiar
salient
and
decisive
invention
of
roman
statecraft
the
powers
conferred
on
the
tribunes
that
they
might
be
the
guardians
of
the
weak
were
ill
defined
but
practically
were
irresistible
they
could
not
govern
but
they
could
arrest
all
government
the
first
and
the
last
step
of
plebeian
progress
was
gained
neither
by
violence
nor
persuasion
but
by
seceding
and
in
like
manner
the
tribunes
overcame
all
the
authorities
of
the
state
by
the
weapon
of
obstruction
it
was
by
stopping
public
business
for
five
years
that
licinius
established
democratic
equality
the
safeguard
against
abuse
was
the
right
of
each
tribune
to
veto
the
acts
of
his
colleagues
as
they
were
independent
of
their
electors
and
as
there
could
hardly
fail
to
be
one
wise
and
honest
man
among
the
ten
this
was
the
most
effective
instrument
for
the
defence
of
minorities
ever
devised
by
man
after
the
hortensian
law
which
in
the
year
gave
to
the
plebeian
assembly
legislative
authority
the
tribunes
ceased
to
represent
the
cause
of
a
minority
and
their
work
was
done
a
scheme
less
plausible
or
less
hopeful
than
one
which
created
two
sovereign
legislatures
side
by
side
in
the
same
community
would
be
hard
to
find
yet
it
effectually
closed
the
conflict
of
centuries
and
gave
to
rome
an
epoch
of
constant
prosperity
and
greatness
no
real
division
subsisted
in
the
people
corresponding
to
the
artificial
division
in
the
state
fifty
years
passed
away
before
the
popular
assembly
made
use
of
its
prerogative
and
passed
a
law
in
opposition
to
the
senate
polybius
could
not
detect
a
flaw
in
the
structure
as
it
stood
the
harmony
seemed
to
be
complete
and
he
judged
that
a
more
perfect
example
of
composite
government
could
not
exist
but
during
those
happy
years
the
cause
which
wrought
the
ruin
of
roman
freedom
was
in
full
activity
for
it
was
the
condition
of
perpetual
war
that
brought
about
the
three
great
changes
which
were
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
reforms
of
the
gracchi
the
arming
of
the
paupers
and
the
gift
of
the
roman
suffrage
to
the
people
of
italy
before
the
romans
began
their
career
of
foreign
conquest
they
possessed
an
army
of
men
and
from
that
time
the
consumption
of
citizens
in
war
was
incessant
regions
once
crowded
with
the
small
freeholds
of
four
or
five
acres
which
were
the
ideal
unit
of
roman
society
and
the
sinew
of
the
army
and
the
state
were
covered
with
herds
of
cattle
and
herds
of
slaves
and
the
substance
of
the
governing
democracy
was
drained
the
policy
of
the
agrarian
reform
was
to
reconstitute
this
peasant
class
out
of
the
public
domains
that
is
out
of
lands
which
the
ruling
families
had
possessed
for
generations
which
they
had
bought
and
sold
inherited
divided
cultivated
and
improved
the
conflict
of
interests
that
had
so
long
slumbered
revived
with
a
fury
unknown
in
the
controversy
between
the
patricians
and
the
plebs
for
it
was
now
a
question
not
of
equal
rights
but
of
subjugation
the
social
restoration
of
democratic
elements
could
not
be
accomplished
without
demolishing
the
senate
and
this
crisis
at
last
exposed
the
defect
of
the
machinery
and
the
peril
of
divided
powers
that
were
not
to
be
controlled
or
reconciled
the
popular
assembly
led
by
gracchus
had
the
power
of
making
laws
and
the
only
constitutional
check
was
that
one
of
the
tribunes
should
be
induced
to
bar
the
proceedings
accordingly
the
tribune
octavius
interposed
his
veto
the
tribunician
power
the
most
sacred
of
powers
which
could
not
be
questioned
because
it
was
founded
on
a
covenant
between
the
two
parts
of
the
community
and
formed
the
keystone
of
their
union
was
employed
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
the
people
to
prevent
a
reform
on
which
the
preservation
of
the
democracy
depended
gracchus
caused
octavius
to
be
deposed
though
not
illegal
this
was
a
thing
unheard
of
and
it
seemed
to
the
romans
a
sacrilegious
act
that
shook
the
pillars
of
the
state
for
it
was
the
first
significant
revelation
of
democratic
sovereignty
a
tribune
might
burn
the
arsenal
and
betray
the
city
yet
he
could
not
be
called
to
account
until
his
year
of
office
had
expired
but
when
he
employed
against
the
people
the
authority
with
which
they
had
invested
him
the
spell
was
dissolved
the
tribunes
had
been
instituted
as
the
champions
of
the
oppressed
when
the
plebs
feared
oppression
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
not
interfere
on
the
weaker
side
when
the
democracy
were
the
strongest
they
were
chosen
by
the
people
as
their
defence
against
the
aristocracy
it
was
not
to
be
borne
that
they
should
become
the
agents
of
the
aristocracy
to
make
them
once
more
supreme
against
a
popular
tribune
whom
no
colleague
was
suffered
to
oppose
the
wealthy
classes
were
defenceless
it
is
true
that
he
held
office
and
was
inviolable
only
for
a
year
but
the
younger
gracchus
was
the
nobles
accused
him
of
aiming
at
the
crown
a
tribune
who
should
be
practically
irremovable
as
well
as
legally
irresistible
was
little
less
than
an
emperor
the
senate
carried
on
the
conflict
as
men
do
who
fight
not
for
public
interests
but
for
their
own
existence
they
rescinded
the
agrarian
laws
they
murdered
the
popular
leaders
they
abandoned
the
constitution
to
save
themselves
and
invested
sylla
with
a
power
beyond
all
monarchs
to
exterminate
their
foes
the
ghastly
conception
of
a
magistrate
legally
proclaimed
superior
to
all
the
laws
was
familiar
to
the
stern
spirit
of
the
romans
the
decemvirs
had
enjoyed
that
arbitrary
authority
but
practically
they
were
restrained
by
the
two
provisions
which
alone
were
deemed
efficacious
in
rome
the
short
duration
of
office
and
its
distribution
among
several
colleagues
but
the
appointment
of
sylla
was
neither
limited
nor
divided
it
was
to
last
as
long
as
he
chose
whatever
he
might
do
was
right
and
he
was
empowered
to
put
whomsoever
he
pleased
to
death
without
trial
or
accusation
all
the
victims
who
were
butchered
by
his
satellites
suffered
with
the
full
sanction
of
the
law
when
at
last
the
democracy
conquered
the
augustan
monarchy
by
which
they
perpetuated
their
triumph
was
moderate
in
comparison
with
the
licensed
tyranny
of
the
aristocratic
chief
the
emperor
was
the
constitutional
head
of
the
republic
armed
with
all
the
powers
requisite
to
master
the
senate
the
instrument
which
had
served
to
cast
down
the
patricians
was
efficient
against
the
new
aristocracy
of
wealth
and
office
the
tribunician
power
conferred
in
perpetuity
made
it
unnecessary
to
create
a
king
or
a
dictator
thrice
the
senate
proposed
to
augustus
the
supreme
power
of
making
laws
he
declared
that
the
power
of
the
tribunes
already
supplied
him
with
all
that
he
required
it
enabled
him
to
preserve
the
forms
of
a
simulated
republic
the
most
popular
of
all
the
magistracies
of
rome
furnished
the
marrow
of
imperialism
for
the
empire
was
created
not
by
usurpation
but
by
the
legal
act
of
a
jubilant
people
eager
to
close
the
era
of
bloodshed
and
to
secure
the
largess
of
grain
and
coin
which
amounted
at
last
to
pounds
a
year
the
people
transferred
to
the
emperor
the
plenitude
of
their
own
sovereignty
to
limit
his
delegated
power
was
to
challenge
their
omnipotence
to
renew
the
issue
between
the
many
and
the
few
which
had
been
decided
at
pharsalus
and
philippi
the
romans
upheld
the
absolutism
of
the
empire
because
it
was
their
own
the
elementary
antagonism
between
liberty
and
democracy
between
the
welfare
of
minorities
and
the
supremacy
of
masses
became
manifest
the
friend
of
the
one
was
a
traitor
to
the
other
the
dogma
that
absolute
power
may
by
the
hypothesis
of
a
popular
origin
be
as
legitimate
as
constitutional
freedom
began
by
the
combined
support
of
the
people
and
the
throne
to
darken
the
air
legitimate
in
the
technical
sense
of
modern
politics
the
empire
was
not
meant
to
be
it
had
no
right
or
claim
to
subsist
apart
from
the
will
of
the
people
to
limit
the
emperor
authority
was
to
renounce
their
own
but
to
take
it
away
was
to
assert
their
own
they
gave
the
empire
as
they
chose
they
took
it
away
as
they
chose
the
revolution
was
as
lawful
and
as
irresponsible
as
the
empire
democratic
institutions
continued
to
develop
the
provinces
were
no
longer
subject
to
an
assembly
meeting
in
a
distant
capital
they
obtained
the
privileges
of
roman
citizens
long
after
tiberius
had
stripped
the
inhabitants
of
rome
of
their
electoral
function
the
provincials
continued
in
undisturbed
enjoyment
of
the
right
of
choosing
their
own
magistrates
they
governed
themselves
like
a
vast
confederation
of
municipal
republics
and
even
after
diocletian
had
brought
in
the
forms
as
well
as
the
reality
of
despotism
provincial
assemblies
the
obscure
germ
of
representative
institutions
exercised
some
control
over
the
imperial
officers
but
the
empire
owed
the
intensity
of
its
force
to
the
popular
fiction
the
principle
that
the
emperor
is
not
subject
to
laws
from
which
he
can
dispense
others
legibus
was
interpreted
to
imply
that
he
was
above
all
legal
restraint
there
was
no
appeal
from
his
sentence
he
was
the
living
law
the
roman
jurists
whilst
they
adorned
their
writings
with
the
exalted
philosophy
of
the
stoics
consecrated
every
excess
of
imperial
prerogative
with
those
famous
maxims
which
have
been
balm
to
so
many
consciences
and
have
sanctioned
so
much
wrong
and
the
code
of
justinian
became
the
greatest
obstacle
next
to
feudalism
with
which
liberty
had
to
contend
ancient
democracy
as
it
was
in
athens
in
the
best
days
of
pericles
or
in
rome
when
polybius
described
it
or
even
as
it
is
idealised
by
aristotle
in
the
sixth
book
of
his
and
by
cicero
in
the
beginning
of
the
republic
was
never
more
than
a
partial
and
insincere
solution
of
the
problem
of
popular
government
the
ancient
politicians
aimed
no
higher
than
to
diffuse
power
among
a
numerous
class
their
liberty
was
bound
up
with
slavery
they
never
attempted
to
found
a
free
state
on
the
thrift
and
energy
of
free
labour
they
never
divined
the
harder
but
more
grateful
task
that
constitutes
the
political
life
of
christian
nations
by
humbling
the
supremacy
of
rank
and
wealth
by
forbidding
the
state
to
encroach
on
the
domain
which
belongs
to
god
by
teaching
man
to
love
his
neighbour
as
himself
by
promoting
the
sense
of
equality
by
condemning
the
pride
of
race
which
was
a
stimulus
of
conquest
and
the
doctrine
of
separate
descent
which
formed
the
philosopher
defence
of
slavery
and
by
addressing
not
the
rulers
but
the
masses
of
mankind
and
making
opinion
superior
to
authority
the
church
that
preached
the
gospel
to
the
poor
had
visible
points
of
contact
with
democracy
and
yet
christianity
did
not
directly
influence
political
progress
the
ancient
watchword
of
the
republic
was
translated
by
papinian
into
the
language
of
the
church
summa
est
ratio
quæ
pro
religione
fiat
and
for
eleven
hundred
years
from
the
first
to
the
last
of
the
constantines
the
christian
empire
was
as
despotic
as
the
pagan
meanwhile
western
europe
was
overrun
by
men
who
in
their
early
home
had
been
republicans
the
primitive
constitution
of
the
german
communities
was
based
on
association
rather
than
on
subordination
they
were
accustomed
to
govern
their
affairs
by
common
deliberation
and
to
obey
authorities
that
were
temporary
and
defined
it
is
one
of
the
desperate
enterprises
of
historical
science
to
trace
the
free
institutions
of
europe
and
america
and
australia
to
the
life
that
was
led
in
the
forests
of
germany
but
the
new
states
were
founded
on
conquest
and
in
war
the
germans
were
commanded
by
kings
the
doctrine
of
applied
to
gaul
and
spain
would
have
made
frank
and
goth
disappear
in
the
mass
of
the
conquered
people
it
needed
all
the
resources
of
a
vigorous
monarchy
of
a
military
aristocracy
and
of
a
territorial
clergy
to
construct
states
that
were
able
to
last
the
result
was
the
feudal
system
the
most
absolute
contradiction
of
democracy
that
has
coexisted
with
civilisation
the
revival
of
democracy
was
due
neither
to
the
christian
church
nor
to
the
teutonic
state
but
to
the
quarrel
between
them
the
effect
followed
the
cause
instantaneously
as
soon
as
gregory
vii
made
the
papacy
independent
of
the
empire
the
great
conflict
began
and
the
same
pontificate
gave
birth
to
the
theory
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
the
gregorian
party
argued
that
the
emperor
derived
his
crown
from
the
nation
and
that
the
nation
could
take
away
what
it
had
bestowed
the
imperialists
replied
that
nobody
could
take
away
what
the
nation
had
given
it
is
idle
to
look
for
the
spark
either
in
flint
or
steel
the
object
of
both
parties
was
unqualified
supremacy
fitznigel
has
no
more
idea
of
ecclesiastical
liberty
than
john
of
salisbury
of
political
innocent
iv
is
as
perfect
an
absolutist
as
peter
de
vineis
but
each
party
encouraged
democracy
in
turn
by
seeking
the
aid
of
the
towns
each
party
in
turn
appealed
to
the
people
and
gave
strength
to
the
constitutional
theory
in
the
fourteenth
century
english
parliaments
judged
and
deposed
their
kings
as
a
matter
of
right
the
estates
governed
france
without
king
or
noble
and
the
wealth
and
liberties
of
the
towns
which
had
worked
out
their
independence
from
the
centre
of
italy
to
the
north
sea
promised
for
a
moment
to
transform
european
society
even
in
the
capitals
of
great
princes
in
rome
in
paris
and
for
two
terrible
days
in
london
the
commons
obtained
sway
but
the
curse
of
instability
was
on
the
municipal
republics
strasburg
according
to
erasmus
and
bodin
the
best
governed
of
all
suffered
from
perpetual
commotions
an
ingenious
historian
has
reckoned
seven
thousand
revolutions
in
the
italian
cities
the
democracies
succeeded
no
better
than
feudalism
in
regulating
the
balance
between
rich
and
poor
the
atrocities
of
the
jacquerie
and
of
wat
tyler
rebellion
hardened
the
hearts
of
men
against
the
common
people
church
and
state
combined
to
put
them
down
and
the
last
memorable
struggles
of
mediæval
liberty
the
insurrection
of
the
comuneros
in
castile
the
peasants
war
in
germany
the
republic
of
florence
and
the
revolt
of
ghent
were
suppressed
by
charles
in
the
early
years
of
the
reformation
the
middle
ages
had
forged
a
complete
arsenal
of
constitutional
maxims
trial
by
jury
taxation
by
representation
local
ecclesiastical
independence
responsible
authority
but
they
were
not
secured
by
institutions
and
the
reformation
began
by
making
the
dry
bones
more
dry
luther
claimed
to
be
the
first
divine
who
did
justice
to
the
civil
power
he
made
the
lutheran
church
the
bulwark
of
political
stability
and
bequeathed
to
his
disciples
the
doctrine
of
divine
right
and
passive
obedience
zwingli
who
was
a
staunch
republican
desired
that
all
magistrates
should
be
elected
and
should
be
liable
to
be
dismissed
by
their
electors
but
he
died
too
soon
for
his
influence
and
the
permanent
action
of
the
reformation
on
democracy
was
exercised
through
the
presbyterian
constitution
of
calvin
it
was
long
before
the
democratic
element
in
presbyterianism
began
to
tell
the
netherlands
resisted
philip
ii
for
fifteen
years
before
they
took
courage
to
depose
him
and
the
scheme
of
the
deventer
to
subvert
the
ascendency
of
the
leading
states
by
the
sovereign
action
of
the
whole
people
was
foiled
by
incapacity
and
by
the
consummate
policy
of
barnevelt
the
huguenots
having
lost
their
leaders
in
reconstituted
themselves
on
a
democratic
footing
and
learned
to
think
that
a
king
who
murders
his
subjects
forfeits
his
divine
right
to
be
obeyed
but
junius
brutus
and
buchanan
damaged
their
credit
by
advocating
regicide
and
hotoman
whose
is
the
most
serious
work
of
the
group
deserted
his
liberal
opinions
when
the
chief
of
his
own
party
became
king
the
most
violent
explosion
of
democracy
in
that
age
proceeded
from
the
opposite
quarter
when
henry
of
navarre
became
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
of
france
the
theory
of
the
deposing
power
which
had
proved
ineffectual
for
more
than
a
century
awoke
with
a
new
and
more
vigorous
life
of
the
nation
accepted
the
view
that
they
were
not
bound
to
submit
to
a
king
they
would
not
have
chosen
a
committee
of
sixteen
made
itself
master
of
paris
and
with
the
aid
of
spain
succeeded
for
years
in
excluding
henry
from
his
capital
the
impulse
thus
given
endured
in
literature
for
a
whole
generation
and
produced
a
library
of
treatises
on
the
right
of
catholics
to
choose
to
control
and
to
cashier
their
magistrates
they
were
on
the
losing
side
most
of
them
were
bloodthirsty
and
were
soon
forgotten
but
the
greater
part
of
the
political
ideas
of
milton
locke
and
rousseau
may
be
found
in
the
ponderous
latin
of
jesuits
who
were
subjects
of
the
spanish
crown
of
lessius
molina
mariana
and
suarez
the
ideas
were
there
and
were
taken
up
when
it
suited
them
by
extreme
adherents
of
rome
and
of
geneva
but
they
produced
no
lasting
fruit
until
a
century
after
the
reformation
they
became
incorporated
in
new
religious
systems
five
years
of
civil
war
could
not
exhaust
the
royalism
of
the
presbyterians
and
it
required
the
expulsion
of
the
majority
to
make
the
long
parliament
abandon
monarchy
it
had
defended
the
constitution
against
the
crown
with
legal
arts
defending
precedent
against
innovation
and
setting
up
an
ideal
in
the
past
which
with
all
the
learning
of
selden
and
of
prynne
was
less
certain
than
the
puritan
statesmen
supposed
the
independents
brought
in
a
new
principle
tradition
had
no
authority
for
them
and
the
past
no
virtue
liberty
of
conscience
a
thing
not
to
be
found
in
the
constitution
was
more
prized
by
many
of
them
than
all
the
statutes
of
the
plantagenets
their
idea
that
each
congregation
should
govern
itself
abolished
the
force
which
is
needed
to
preserve
unity
and
deprived
monarchy
of
the
weapon
which
made
it
injurious
to
freedom
an
immense
revolutionary
energy
resided
in
their
doctrine
and
it
took
root
in
america
and
deeply
coloured
political
thought
in
later
times
but
in
england
the
sectarian
democracy
was
strong
only
to
destroy
cromwell
refused
to
be
bound
by
it
and
john
lilburne
the
boldest
thinker
among
english
democrats
declared
that
it
would
be
better
for
liberty
to
bring
back
charles
stuart
than
to
live
under
the
sword
of
the
protector
lilburne
was
among
the
first
to
understand
the
real
conditions
of
democracy
and
the
obstacle
to
its
success
in
england
equality
of
power
could
not
be
preserved
except
by
violence
together
with
an
extreme
inequality
of
possessions
there
would
always
be
danger
if
power
was
not
made
to
wait
on
property
that
property
would
go
to
those
who
had
the
power
this
idea
of
the
necessary
balance
of
property
developed
by
harrington
and
adopted
by
milton
in
his
later
pamphlets
appeared
to
toland
and
even
to
john
adams
as
important
as
the
invention
of
printing
or
the
discovery
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
at
least
it
indicates
the
true
explanation
of
the
strange
completeness
with
which
the
republican
party
had
vanished
a
dozen
years
after
the
solemn
trial
and
execution
of
the
king
no
extremity
of
misgovernment
was
able
to
revive
it
when
the
treason
of
charles
ii
against
the
constitution
was
divulged
and
the
whigs
plotted
to
expel
the
incorrigible
dynasty
their
aspirations
went
no
farther
than
a
venetian
oligarchy
with
monmouth
for
doge
the
revolution
of
confined
power
to
the
aristocracy
of
freeholders
the
conservatism
of
the
age
was
unconquerable
republicanism
was
distorted
even
in
switzerland
and
became
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
oppressive
and
as
intolerant
as
its
neighbours
in
when
paoli
fled
from
corsica
it
seemed
that
in
europe
at
least
democracy
was
dead
it
had
indeed
lately
been
defended
in
books
by
a
man
of
bad
reputation
whom
the
leaders
of
public
opinion
treated
with
contumely
and
whose
declamations
excited
so
little
alarm
that
george
iii
offered
him
a
pension
what
gave
to
rousseau
a
power
far
exceeding
that
which
any
political
writer
had
ever
attained
was
the
progress
of
events
in
america
the
stuarts
had
been
willing
that
the
colonies
should
serve
as
a
refuge
from
their
system
of
church
and
state
and
of
all
their
colonies
the
one
most
favoured
was
the
territory
granted
to
william
penn
by
the
principles
of
the
society
to
which
he
belonged
it
was
necessary
that
the
new
state
should
be
founded
on
liberty
and
equality
but
penn
was
further
noted
among
quakers
as
a
follower
of
the
new
doctrine
of
toleration
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
pennsylvania
enjoyed
the
most
democratic
constitution
in
the
world
and
held
up
to
the
admiration
of
the
eighteenth
century
an
almost
solitary
example
of
freedom
it
was
principally
through
franklin
and
the
quaker
state
that
america
influenced
political
opinion
in
europe
and
that
the
fanaticism
of
one
revolutionary
epoch
was
converted
into
the
rationalism
of
another
american
independence
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
not
merely
as
a
revival
of
revolution
but
because
no
other
revolution
ever
proceeded
from
so
slight
a
cause
or
was
ever
conducted
with
so
much
moderation
the
european
monarchies
supported
it
the
greatest
statesmen
in
england
averred
that
it
was
just
it
established
a
pure
democracy
but
it
was
democracy
in
its
highest
perfection
armed
and
vigilant
less
against
aristocracy
and
monarchy
than
against
its
own
weakness
and
excess
whilst
england
was
admired
for
the
safeguards
with
which
in
the
course
of
many
centuries
it
had
fortified
liberty
against
the
power
of
the
crown
america
appeared
still
more
worthy
of
admiration
for
the
safeguards
which
in
the
deliberations
of
a
single
memorable
year
it
had
set
up
against
the
power
of
its
own
sovereign
people
it
resembled
no
other
known
democracy
for
it
respected
freedom
authority
and
law
it
resembled
no
other
constitution
for
it
was
contained
in
half
a
dozen
intelligible
articles
ancient
europe
opened
its
mind
to
two
new
ideas
that
revolution
with
very
little
provocation
may
be
just
and
that
democracy
in
very
large
dimensions
may
be
safe
whilst
america
was
making
itself
independent
the
spirit
of
reform
had
been
abroad
in
europe
intelligent
ministers
like
campomanes
and
struensee
and
monarchs
of
whom
the
most
liberal
was
leopold
of
tuscany
were
trying
what
could
be
done
to
make
men
happy
by
command
centuries
of
absolute
and
intolerant
rule
had
bequeathed
abuses
which
nothing
but
the
most
vigorous
use
of
power
could
remove
the
age
preferred
the
reign
of
intellect
to
the
reign
of
liberty
turgot
the
ablest
and
most
reformer
then
living
attempted
to
do
for
france
what
less
gifted
men
were
doing
with
success
in
lombardy
and
tuscany
and
parma
he
attempted
to
employ
the
royal
power
for
the
good
of
the
people
at
the
expense
of
the
higher
classes
the
higher
classes
proved
too
strong
for
the
crown
alone
and
louis
xvi
abandoned
internal
reforms
in
despair
and
turned
for
compensation
to
a
war
with
england
for
the
deliverance
of
her
american
colonies
when
the
increasing
debt
obliged
him
to
seek
heroic
remedies
and
he
was
again
repulsed
by
the
privileged
orders
he
appealed
at
last
to
the
nation
when
the
met
the
power
had
already
passed
to
the
middle
class
for
it
was
by
them
alone
that
the
country
could
be
saved
they
were
strong
enough
to
triumph
by
waiting
neither
the
court
nor
the
nobles
nor
the
army
could
do
anything
against
them
during
the
six
months
from
january
to
the
fall
of
the
bastille
in
july
france
travelled
as
far
as
england
in
the
six
hundred
years
between
the
earl
of
leicester
and
lord
beaconsfield
ten
years
after
the
american
alliance
the
rights
of
man
which
had
been
proclaimed
at
philadelphia
were
repeated
at
versailles
the
alliance
had
borne
fruit
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
and
for
france
the
fruit
was
the
triumph
of
american
ideas
over
english
they
were
more
popular
more
simple
more
effective
against
privilege
and
strange
to
say
more
acceptable
to
the
king
the
new
french
constitution
allowed
no
privileged
orders
no
parliamentary
ministry
no
power
of
dissolution
and
only
a
suspensive
veto
but
the
characteristic
safeguards
of
the
american
government
were
rejected
federalism
separation
of
church
and
state
the
second
chamber
the
political
arbitration
of
the
supreme
judicial
body
that
which
weakened
the
executive
was
taken
that
which
restrained
the
legislature
was
left
checks
on
the
crown
abounded
but
should
the
crown
be
vacant
the
powers
that
remained
would
be
without
a
check
the
precautions
were
all
in
one
direction
nobody
would
contemplate
the
contingency
that
there
might
be
no
king
the
constitution
was
inspired
by
a
profound
disbelief
in
louis
xvi
and
a
pertinacious
belief
in
monarchy
the
assembly
voted
without
debate
by
acclamation
a
civil
list
three
times
as
large
as
that
of
queen
victoria
when
louis
fled
and
the
throne
was
actually
vacant
they
brought
him
back
to
it
preferring
the
phantom
of
a
king
who
was
a
prisoner
to
the
reality
of
no
king
at
all
next
to
this
misapplication
of
american
examples
which
was
the
fault
of
nearly
all
the
leading
statesmen
excepting
mounier
mirabeau
and
sieyès
the
cause
of
the
revolution
was
injured
by
its
religious
policy
the
most
novel
and
impressive
lesson
taught
by
the
fathers
of
the
american
republic
was
that
the
people
and
not
the
administration
should
govern
men
in
office
were
salaried
agents
by
whom
the
nation
wrought
its
will
authority
submitted
to
public
opinion
and
left
to
it
not
only
the
control
but
the
initiative
of
government
patience
in
waiting
for
a
wind
alacrity
in
catching
it
the
dread
of
exerting
unnecessary
influence
characterise
the
early
presidents
some
of
the
french
politicians
shared
this
view
though
with
less
exaggeration
than
washington
they
wished
to
decentralise
the
government
and
to
obtain
for
good
or
evil
the
genuine
expression
of
popular
sentiment
necker
himself
and
buzot
the
most
thoughtful
of
the
girondins
dreamed
of
federalising
france
in
the
united
states
there
was
no
current
of
opinion
and
no
combination
of
forces
to
be
seriously
feared
the
government
needed
no
security
against
being
propelled
in
a
wrong
direction
but
the
french
revolution
was
accomplished
at
the
expense
of
powerful
classes
besides
the
nobles
the
assembly
which
had
been
made
supreme
by
the
accession
of
the
clergy
and
had
been
led
at
first
by
popular
ecclesiastics
by
sieyès
talleyrand
cicé
la
luzerne
made
an
enemy
of
the
clergy
the
prerogative
could
not
be
destroyed
without
touching
the
church
ecclesiastical
patronage
had
helped
to
make
the
crown
absolute
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
louis
and
his
ministers
was
to
renounce
the
entire
policy
of
the
constitution
to
disestablish
was
to
make
it
over
to
the
pope
it
was
consistent
with
the
democratic
principle
to
introduce
election
into
the
church
it
involved
a
breach
with
rome
but
so
indeed
did
the
laws
of
joseph
charles
and
leopold
the
pope
was
not
likely
to
cast
away
the
friendship
of
france
if
he
could
help
it
and
the
french
clergy
were
not
likely
to
give
trouble
by
their
attachment
to
rome
therefore
amid
the
indifference
of
many
and
against
the
urgent
and
probably
sincere
remonstrances
of
robespierre
and
marat
the
jansenists
who
had
a
century
of
persecution
to
avenge
carried
the
civil
constitution
the
coercive
measures
which
enforced
it
led
to
the
breach
with
the
king
and
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
to
the
revolt
of
the
provinces
and
the
fall
of
liberty
the
jacobins
determined
that
public
opinion
should
not
reign
that
the
state
should
not
remain
at
the
mercy
of
powerful
combinations
they
held
the
representatives
of
the
people
under
control
by
the
people
itself
they
attributed
higher
authority
to
the
direct
than
to
the
indirect
voice
of
the
democratic
oracle
they
armed
themselves
with
power
to
crush
every
adverse
every
independent
force
and
especially
to
put
down
the
church
in
whose
cause
the
provinces
had
risen
against
the
capital
they
met
the
centrifugal
federalism
of
the
friends
of
the
gironde
by
the
most
resolute
centralisation
france
was
governed
by
paris
and
paris
by
its
municipality
and
its
mob
obeying
rousseau
maxim
that
the
people
can
not
delegate
its
power
they
raised
the
elementary
constituency
above
its
representatives
as
the
greatest
constituent
body
the
most
numerous
accumulation
of
primary
electors
the
largest
portion
of
sovereignty
was
in
the
people
of
paris
they
designed
that
the
people
of
paris
should
rule
over
france
as
the
people
of
rome
the
mob
as
well
as
the
senate
had
ruled
not
ingloriously
over
italy
and
over
half
the
nations
that
surround
the
mediterranean
although
the
jacobins
were
scarcely
more
irreligious
than
the
abbé
sieyès
or
madame
roland
although
robespierre
wanted
to
force
men
to
believe
in
god
although
danton
went
to
confession
and
barère
was
a
professing
christian
they
imparted
to
modern
democracy
that
implacable
hatred
of
religion
which
contrasts
so
strangely
with
the
example
of
its
puritan
prototype
the
deepest
cause
which
made
the
french
revolution
so
disastrous
to
liberty
was
its
theory
of
equality
liberty
was
the
watchword
of
the
middle
class
equality
of
the
lower
it
was
the
lower
class
that
won
the
battles
of
the
third
estate
that
took
the
bastille
and
made
france
a
constitutional
monarchy
that
took
the
tuileries
and
made
france
a
republic
they
claimed
their
reward
the
middle
class
having
cast
down
the
upper
orders
with
the
aid
of
the
lower
instituted
a
new
inequality
and
a
privilege
for
itself
by
means
of
a
taxpaying
qualification
it
deprived
its
confederates
of
their
vote
to
those
therefore
who
had
accomplished
the
revolution
its
promise
was
not
fulfilled
equality
did
nothing
for
them
the
opinion
at
that
time
was
almost
universal
that
society
is
founded
on
an
agreement
which
is
voluntary
and
conditional
and
that
the
links
which
bind
men
to
it
are
terminable
for
sufficient
reason
like
those
which
subject
them
to
authority
from
these
popular
premises
the
logic
of
marat
drew
his
sanguinary
conclusions
he
told
the
famished
people
that
the
conditions
on
which
they
had
consented
to
bear
their
evil
lot
and
had
refrained
from
violence
had
not
been
kept
to
them
it
was
suicide
it
was
murder
to
submit
to
starve
and
to
see
one
children
starving
by
the
fault
of
the
rich
the
bonds
of
society
were
dissolved
by
the
wrong
it
inflicted
the
state
of
nature
had
come
back
in
which
every
man
had
a
right
to
what
he
could
take
the
time
had
come
for
the
rich
to
make
way
for
the
poor
with
this
theory
of
equality
liberty
was
quenched
in
blood
and
frenchmen
became
ready
to
sacrifice
all
other
things
to
save
life
and
fortune
twenty
years
after
the
splendid
opportunity
that
opened
in
the
reaction
had
triumphed
everywhere
in
europe
ancient
constitutions
had
perished
as
well
as
new
and
even
england
afforded
them
neither
protection
nor
sympathy
the
liberal
at
least
the
democratic
revival
came
from
spain
the
spaniards
fought
against
the
french
for
a
king
who
was
a
prisoner
in
france
they
gave
themselves
a
constitution
and
placed
his
name
at
the
head
of
it
they
had
a
monarchy
without
a
king
it
required
to
be
so
contrived
that
it
would
work
in
the
absence
possibly
the
permanent
absence
of
the
monarch
it
became
therefore
a
monarchy
only
in
name
composed
in
fact
of
democratic
forces
the
constitution
of
was
the
attempt
of
inexperienced
men
to
accomplish
the
most
difficult
task
in
politics
it
was
smitten
with
sterility
for
many
years
it
was
the
standard
of
abortive
revolutions
among
the
latin
nations
it
promulgated
the
notion
of
a
king
who
should
flourish
only
in
name
and
should
not
even
discharge
the
humble
function
which
hegel
assigns
to
royalty
of
dotting
i
for
the
people
the
overthrow
of
the
cadiz
constitution
in
was
the
supreme
triumph
of
the
restored
monarchy
of
france
five
years
later
under
a
wise
and
liberal
minister
the
restoration
was
advancing
fairly
on
the
constitutional
paths
when
the
incurable
distrust
of
the
liberal
party
defeated
martignac
and
brought
in
the
ministry
of
extreme
royalists
that
ruined
the
monarchy
in
labouring
to
transfer
power
from
the
class
which
the
revolution
had
enfranchised
to
those
which
it
had
overthrown
polignac
and
la
bourdonnaie
would
gladly
have
made
terms
with
the
working
men
to
break
the
influence
of
intellect
and
capital
by
means
of
universal
suffrage
was
an
idea
long
and
zealously
advocated
by
some
of
their
supporters
they
had
not
foresight
or
ability
to
divide
their
adversaries
and
they
were
vanquished
in
by
the
united
democracy
the
promise
of
the
revolution
of
july
was
to
reconcile
royalists
and
democrats
the
king
assured
lafayette
that
he
was
a
republican
at
heart
and
lafayette
assured
france
that
louis
philippe
was
the
best
of
republics
the
shock
of
the
great
event
was
felt
in
poland
and
belgium
and
even
in
england
it
gave
a
direct
impulse
to
democratic
movements
in
switzerland
swiss
democracy
had
been
in
abeyance
since
the
national
will
had
no
organ
the
cantons
were
supreme
and
governed
as
inefficiently
as
other
governments
under
the
protecting
shade
of
the
holy
alliance
there
was
no
dispute
that
switzerland
called
for
extensive
reforms
and
no
doubt
of
the
direction
they
would
take
the
number
of
the
cantons
was
the
great
obstacle
to
all
improvement
it
was
useless
to
have
governments
in
a
country
equal
to
one
american
state
and
inferior
in
population
to
one
great
city
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
be
good
governments
a
central
power
was
the
manifest
need
of
the
country
in
the
absence
of
an
efficient
federal
power
seven
cantons
formed
a
separate
league
for
the
protection
of
their
own
interests
whilst
democratic
ideas
were
making
way
in
switzerland
the
papacy
was
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction
and
showing
an
inflexible
hostility
for
ideas
which
are
the
breath
of
democratic
life
the
growing
democracy
and
the
growing
ultramontanism
came
into
collision
the
sonderbund
could
aver
with
truth
that
there
was
no
safety
for
its
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
the
others
could
reply
with
equal
truth
that
there
was
no
safety
for
the
constitution
with
the
sonderbund
in
it
came
to
a
war
between
national
sovereignty
and
cantonal
sovereignty
the
sonderbund
was
dissolved
and
a
new
federal
constitution
was
adopted
avowedly
and
ostensibly
charged
with
the
duty
of
carrying
out
democracy
and
repressing
the
adverse
influence
of
rome
it
was
a
delusive
imitation
of
the
american
system
the
president
was
powerless
the
senate
was
powerless
the
supreme
court
was
powerless
the
sovereignty
of
the
cantons
was
undermined
and
their
power
centred
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
constitution
of
was
a
first
step
towards
the
destruction
of
federalism
another
and
almost
a
final
step
in
the
direction
of
centralisation
was
taken
in
the
railways
and
the
vast
interests
they
created
made
the
position
of
the
cantonal
governments
untenable
the
conflict
with
the
ultramontanes
increased
the
demand
for
vigorous
action
and
the
destruction
of
state
rights
in
the
american
war
strengthened
the
hands
of
the
centralists
the
constitution
of
is
one
of
the
most
significant
works
of
modern
democracy
it
is
the
triumph
of
democratic
force
over
democratic
freedom
it
overrules
not
only
the
federal
principle
but
the
representative
principle
it
carries
important
measures
away
from
the
federal
legislature
to
submit
them
to
the
votes
of
the
entire
people
separating
decision
from
deliberation
the
operation
is
so
cumbrous
as
to
be
generally
ineffective
but
it
constitutes
a
power
such
as
exists
we
believe
under
the
laws
of
no
other
country
a
swiss
jurist
has
frankly
expressed
the
spirit
of
the
reigning
system
by
saying
that
the
state
is
the
appointed
conscience
of
the
nation
the
moving
force
in
switzerland
has
been
democracy
relieved
of
all
constraint
the
principle
of
putting
in
action
the
greatest
force
of
the
greatest
number
the
prosperity
of
the
country
has
prevented
complications
such
as
arose
in
france
the
ministers
of
louis
philippe
able
and
enlightened
men
believed
that
they
would
make
the
people
prosper
if
they
could
have
their
own
way
and
could
shut
out
public
opinion
they
acted
as
if
the
intelligent
middle
class
was
destined
by
heaven
to
govern
the
upper
class
had
proved
its
unfitness
before
the
lower
class
since
government
by
professional
men
by
manufacturers
and
scholars
was
sure
to
be
safe
and
almost
sure
to
be
reasonable
and
practical
money
became
the
object
of
a
political
superstition
such
as
had
formerly
attached
to
land
and
afterwards
attached
to
labour
the
masses
of
the
people
who
had
fought
against
marmont
became
aware
that
they
had
not
fought
for
their
own
benefit
they
were
still
governed
by
their
employers
when
the
king
parted
with
lafayette
and
it
was
found
that
he
would
not
only
reign
but
govern
the
indignation
of
the
republicans
found
a
vent
in
street
fighting
in
when
the
horrors
of
the
infernal
machine
had
armed
the
crown
with
ampler
powers
and
had
silenced
the
republican
party
the
term
socialism
made
its
appearance
in
literature
tocqueville
who
was
writing
the
philosophic
chapters
that
conclude
his
work
failed
to
discover
the
power
which
the
new
system
was
destined
to
exercise
on
democracy
until
then
democrats
and
communists
had
stood
apart
although
the
socialist
doctrines
were
defended
by
the
best
intellects
of
france
by
thierry
comte
chevalier
and
georges
sand
they
excited
more
attention
as
a
literary
curiosity
than
as
the
cause
of
future
revolutions
towards
in
the
recesses
of
secret
societies
republicans
and
socialists
coalesced
whilst
the
liberal
leaders
lamartine
and
barrot
discoursed
on
the
surface
concerning
reform
ledru
rollin
and
louis
blanc
were
quietly
digging
a
grave
for
the
monarchy
the
liberal
party
and
the
reign
of
wealth
they
worked
so
well
and
the
vanquished
republicans
recovered
so
thoroughly
by
this
coalition
the
influence
they
had
lost
by
a
long
series
of
crimes
and
follies
that
in
they
were
able
to
conquer
without
fighting
the
fruit
of
their
victory
was
universal
suffrage
from
that
time
the
promises
of
socialism
have
supplied
the
best
energy
of
democracy
their
coalition
has
been
the
ruling
fact
in
french
politics
it
created
the
saviour
of
society
and
the
commune
and
it
still
entangles
the
footsteps
of
the
republic
it
is
the
only
shape
in
which
democracy
has
found
an
entrance
into
germany
liberty
has
lost
its
spell
and
democracy
maintains
itself
by
the
promise
of
substantial
gifts
to
the
masses
of
the
people
since
the
revolution
of
july
and
the
presidency
of
jackson
gave
the
impulse
which
has
made
democracy
preponderate
the
ablest
political
writers
tocqueville
calhoun
mill
and
laboulaye
have
drawn
in
the
name
of
freedom
a
formidable
indictment
against
it
they
have
shown
democracy
without
respect
for
the
past
or
care
for
the
future
regardless
of
public
faith
and
of
national
honour
extravagant
and
inconstant
jealous
of
talent
and
of
knowledge
indifferent
to
justice
but
servile
towards
opinion
incapable
of
organisation
impatient
of
authority
averse
from
obedience
hostile
to
religion
and
to
established
law
evidence
indeed
abounds
even
if
the
true
cause
be
not
proved
but
it
is
not
to
these
symptoms
that
we
must
impute
the
permanent
danger
and
the
irrepressible
conflict
as
much
might
be
made
good
against
monarchy
and
an
unsympathising
reasoner
might
in
the
same
way
argue
that
religion
is
intolerant
that
conscience
makes
cowards
that
piety
rejoices
in
fraud
recent
experience
has
added
little
to
the
observations
of
those
who
witnessed
the
decline
after
pericles
of
thucydides
aristophanes
plato
and
of
the
writer
whose
brilliant
tract
against
the
athenian
republic
is
printed
among
the
works
of
xenophon
the
manifest
the
avowed
difficulty
is
that
democracy
no
less
than
monarchy
or
aristocracy
sacrifices
everything
to
maintain
itself
and
strives
with
an
energy
and
a
plausibility
that
kings
and
nobles
can
not
attain
to
override
representation
to
annul
all
the
forces
of
resistance
and
deviation
and
to
secure
by
plebiscite
referendum
or
caucus
free
play
for
the
will
of
the
majority
the
true
democratic
principle
that
none
shall
have
power
over
the
people

without

absolute
without

the
old

and
deceived

whom
it
is

the
enemy
to

is
no
longer
the
absolutism
of

state
but
the
liberty
of
the
subject
nothing
is
more
significant
than
the
relish
with
which
ferrari
the
most
powerful
democratic
writer
since
rousseau
enumerates
the
merits
of
tyrants
and
prefers
devils
to
saints
in
the
interest
of
the
community
for
the
old
notions
of
civil
liberty
and
of
social
order
did
not
benefit
the
masses
of
the
people
wealth
increased
without
relieving
their
wants
the
progress
of
knowledge
left
them
in
abject
ignorance
religion
flourished
but
failed
to
reach
them
society
whose
laws
were
made
by
the
upper
class
alone
announced
that
the
best
thing
for
the
poor
is
not
to
be
born
and
the
next
best
to
die
in
childhood
and
suffered
them
to
live
in
misery
and
crime
and
pain
as
surely
as
the
long
reign
of
the
rich
has
been
employed
in
promoting
the
accumulation
of
wealth
the
advent
of
the
poor
to
power
will
be
followed
by
schemes
for
diffusing
it
seeing
how
little
was
done
by
the
wisdom
of
former
times
for
education
and
public
health
for
insurance
association
and
savings
for
the
protection
of
labour
against
the
law
of
and
how
much
has
been
accomplished
in
this
generation
there
is
reason
in
the
fixed
belief
that
a
great
change
was
needed
and
that
democracy
has
not
striven
in
vain
liberty
for
the
mass
is
not
happiness
and
institutions
are
not
an
end
but
a
means
the
thing
they
seek
is
a
force
sufficient
to
sweep
away
scruples
and
the
obstacle
of
rival
interests
and
in
some
degree
to
better
their
condition
they
mean
that
the
strong
hand
that
heretofore
has
formed
great
states
protected
religions
and
defended
the
independence
of
nations
shall
help
them
by
preserving
life
and
endowing
it
for
them
with
some
at
least
of
the
things
men
live
for
that
is
the
notorious
danger
of
modern
democracy
that
is
also
its
purpose
and
its
strength
and
against
this
threatening
power
the
weapons
that
struck
down
other
despots
do
not
avail
the
greatest
happiness
principle
positively
confirms
it
the
principle
of
equality
besides
being
as
easily
applied
to
property
as
to
power
opposes
the
existence
of
persons
or
groups
of
persons
exempt
from
the
common
law
and
independent
of
the
common
will
and
the
principle
that
authority
is
a
matter
of
contract
may
hold
good
against
kings
but
not
against
the
sovereign
people
because
a
contract
implies
two
parties
if
we
have
not
done
more
than
the
ancients
to
develop
and
to
examine
the
disease
we
have
far
surpassed
them
in
studying
the
remedy
besides
the
french
constitution
of
the
year
and
that
of
the
american
confederates
the
most
remarkable
attempts
that
have
been
made
since
the
archonship
of
euclides
to
meet
democratic
evils
with
the
antidotes
which
democracy
itself
supplies
our
age
has
been
prolific
in
this
branch
of
experimental
politics
many
expedients
have
been
tried
that
have
been
evaded
or
defeated
a
divided
executive
which
was
an
important
phase
in
the
transformation
of
ancient
monarchies
into
republics
and
which
through
the
advocacy
of
condorcet
took
root
in
france
has
proved
to
be
weakness
itself
the
constitution
of
the
work
of
a
learned
priest
confined
the
franchise
to
those
who
should
know
how
to
read
and
write
and
in
this
provision
was
rejected
by
men
who
intended
that
the
ignorant
voter
should
help
them
to
overturn
the
republic
in
our
time
no
democracy
could
long
subsist
without
educating
the
masses
and
the
scheme
of
daunou
is
simply
an
indirect
encouragement
to
elementary
instruction
in
sieyès
suggested
to
bonaparte
the
idea
of
a
great
council
whose
function
it
should
be
to
keep
the
acts
of
the
legislature
in
harmony
with
the
constitution
a
function
which
the
discharged
at
athens
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
united
states
and
which
produced
the
sénat
conservateur
one
of
the
favourite
implements
of
imperialism
sieyès
meant
that
his
council
should
also
serve
the
purpose
of
a
gilded
ostracism
having
power
to
absorb
any
obnoxious
politician
and
to
silence
him
with
a
thousand
a
year
napoleon
the
third
plan
of
depriving
unmarried
men
of
their
votes
would
have
disfranchised
the
two
greatest
conservative
classes
in
france
the
priest
and
the
soldier
in
the
american
constitution
it
was
intended
that
the
chief
of
the
executive
should
be
chosen
by
a
body
of
carefully
selected
electors
but
since
in
the
popular
candidate
succumbed
to
one
who
had
only
a
minority
of
votes
it
has
become
the
practice
to
elect
the
president
by
the
pledged
delegates
of
universal
suffrage
the
exclusion
of
ministers
from
congress
has
been
one
of
the
severest
strains
on
the
american
system
and
the
law
which
required
a
majority
of
three
to
one
enabled
louis
napoleon
to
make
himself
emperor
large
constituencies
make
independent
deputies
but
experience
proves
that
small
assemblies
the
consequence
of
large
constituencies
can
be
managed
by
government
the
composite
vote
and
the
cumulative
vote
have
been
almost
universally
rejected
as
schemes
for
baffling
the
majority
but
the
principle
of
dividing
the
representatives
equally
between
population
and
property
has
never
had
fair
play
it
was
introduced
by
thouret
into
the
constitution
of
the
revolution
made
it
inoperative
and
it
was
so
manipulated
from
to
by
the
fatal
dexterity
of
guizot
as
to
make
opinion
ripe
for
universal
suffrage
constitutions
which
forbid
the
payment
of
deputies
and
the
system
of
imperative
instructions
which
deny
the
power
of
dissolution
and
make
the
legislature
last
for
a
fixed
term
or
renew
it
by
partial
and
which
require
an
interval
between
the
several
debates
on
the
same
measure
evidently
strengthen
the
independence
of
the
representative
assembly
the
swiss
veto
has
the
same
effect
as
it
suspends
legislation
only
when
opposed
by
a
majority
of
the
whole
electoral
body
not
by
a
majority
of
those
who
actually
vote
upon
it
indirect
elections
are
scarcely
anywhere
in
use
out
of
germany
but
they
have
been
a
favourite
corrective
of
democracy
with
many
thoughtful
politicians
where
the
extent
of
the
electoral
district
obliges
constituents
to
vote
for
candidates
who
are
unknown
to
them
the
election
is
not
free
it
is
managed
by
and
by
party
machinery
beyond
the
control
of
the
electors
indirect
election
puts
the
choice
of
the
managers
into
their
hands
the
objection
is
that
the
intermediate
electors
are
generally
too
few
to
span
the
interval
between
voters
and
candidates
and
that
they
choose
representatives
not
of
better
quality
but
of
different
politics
if
the
intermediate
body
consisted
of
one
in
ten
of
the
whole
constituency
the
contact
would
be
preserved
the
people
would
be
really
represented
and
the
ticket
system
would
be
broken
down
the
one
pervading
evil
of
democracy
is
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
or
rather
of
that
party
not
always
the
majority
that
succeeds
by
force
or
fraud
in
carrying
elections
to
break
off
that
point
is
to
avert
the
danger
the
common
system
of
representation
perpetuates
the
danger
unequal
electorates
afford
no
security
to
majorities
equal
electorates
give
none
to
minorities
years
ago
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
remedy
is
proportional
representation
it
is
profoundly
democratic
for
it
increases
the
influence
of
thousands
who
would
otherwise
have
no
voice
in
the
government
and
it
brings
men
more
near
an
equality
by
so
contriving
that
no
vote
shall
be
wasted
and
that
every
voter
shall
contribute
to
bring
into
parliament
a
member
of
his
own
opinions
the
origin
of
the
idea
is
variously
claimed
for
lord
grey
and
for
considérant
the
successful
example
of
denmark
and
the
earnest
advocacy
of
mill
gave
it
prominence
in
the
world
of
politics
it
has
gained
popularity
with
the
growth
of
democracy
and
we
are
informed
by
naville
that
in
switzerland
conservatives
and
radicals
combined
to
promote
it
of
all
checks
on
democracy
federalism
has
been
the
most
efficacious
and
the
most
congenial
but
becoming
associated
with
the
red
republic
with
feudalism
with
the
jesuits
and
with
slavery
it
has
fallen
into
disrepute
and
is
giving
way
to
centralism
the
federal
system
limits
and
restrains
the
sovereign
power
by
dividing
it
and
by
assigning
to
government
only
certain
defined
rights
it
is
the
only
method
of
curbing
not
only
the
majority
but
the
power
of
the
whole
people
and
it
affords
the
strongest
basis
for
a
second
chamber
which
has
been
found
the
essential
security
for
freedom
in
every
genuine
democracy
the
fall
of
guizot
discredited
the
famous
maxim
of
the
doctrinaires
that
reason
is
sovereign
and
not
king
or
people
and
it
was
further
exposed
to
the
scoffer
by
the
promise
of
comte
that
positivist
philosophers
shall
manufacture
political
ideas
which
no
man
shall
be
permitted
to
dispute
but
putting
aside
international
and
criminal
law
in
which
there
is
some
approach
to
uniformity
the
domain
of
political
economy
seems
destined
to
admit
the
rigorous
certainty
of
science
whenever
that
shall
be
attained
when
the
battle
between
economists
and
socialists
is
ended
the
evil
force
which
socialism
imparts
to
democracy
will
be
spent
the
battle
is
raging
more
violently
than
ever
but
it
has
entered
into
a
new
phase
by
the
rise
of
a
middle
party
whether
that
remarkable
movement
which
is
promoted
by
some
of
the
first
economists
in
europe
is
destined
to
shake
the
authority
of
their
science
or
to
conquer
socialism
by
robbing
it
of
that
which
is
the
secret
of
its
strength
it
must
be
recorded
here
as
the
latest
and
the
most
serious
effort
that
has
been
made
to
disprove
the
weighty
sentence
of
rousseau
that
democracy
is
a
government
for
gods
but
unfit
for
man
we
have
been
able
to
touch
on
only
a
few
of
the
topics
that
crowd
sir
erskine
may
volumes
although
he
has
perceived
more
clearly
than
tocqueville
the
contact
of
democracy
with
socialism
his
judgment
is
untinged
with
tocqueville
despondency
and
he
contemplates
the
direction
of
progress
with
a
confidence
that
approaches
optimism
the
notion
of
an
inflexible
logic
in
history
does
not
depress
him
for
he
concerns
himself
with
facts
and
with
men
more
than
with
doctrines
and
his
book
is
a
history
of
several
democracies
not
of
democracy
there
are
links
in
the
argument
there
are
phases
of
development
which
he
leaves
unnoticed
because
his
object
has
not
been
to
trace
out
the
properties
and
the
connection
of
ideas
but
to
explain
the
results
of
experience
we
should
consult
his
pages
probably
without
effect
if
we
wished
to
follow
the
origin
and
sequence
of
the
democratic
dogmas
that
all
men
are
equal
that
speech
and
thought
are
free
that
each
generation
is
a
law
to
itself
only
that
there
shall
be
no
endowments
no
entails
no
primogeniture
that
the
people
are
sovereign
that
the
people
can
do
no
wrong
the
great
mass
of
those
who
of
necessity
are
interested
in
practical
politics
have
no
such
antiquarian
curiosity
they
want
to
know
what
can
be
learned
from
the
countries
where
the
democratic
experiments
have
been
tried
but
they
do
not
care
to
be
told
how
waddington
has
emended
the
what
connection
there
was
between
mariana
and
milton
or
between
penn
and
rousseau
or
who
invented
the
proverb
populi
vox
sir
erskine
may
reluctance
to
deal
with
matters
speculative
and
doctrinal
and
to
devote
his
space
to
the
mere
literary
history
of
politics
has
made
his
touch
somewhat
uncertain
in
treating
of
the
political
action
of
christianity
perhaps
the
most
complex
and
comprehensive
question
that
can
embarrass
a
historian
he
disparages
the
influence
of
the
mediæval
church
on
nations
just
emerging
from
a
barbarous
paganism
and
he
exalts
it
when
it
had
become
associated
with
despotism
and
persecution
he
insists
on
the
liberating
action
of
the
reformation
in
the
sixteenth
century
when
it
gave
a
stimulus
to
absolutism
and
he
is
slow
to
recognise
in
the
enthusiasm
and
violence
of
the
sects
in
the
seventeenth
the
most
potent
agency
ever
brought
to
bear
on
democratic
history
the
omission
of
america
creates
a
void
between
and
and
leaves
much
unexplained
in
the
revolutionary
movement
of
the
last
hundred
years
which
is
the
central
problem
of
the
book
but
if
some
things
are
missed
from
the
design
if
the
execution
is
not
equal
in
every
part
the
praise
remains
to
sir
erskine
may
that
he
is
the
only
writer
who
has
ever
brought
together
the
materials
for
a
comparative
study
of
democracy
that
he
has
avoided
the
temper
of
party
that
he
has
shown
a
hearty
sympathy
for
the
progress
and
improvement
of

these
manuscripts
with
others
of
equal
importance
not
previously
consulted
determine
several
doubtful
questions
of
policy
and
design
the
protestants
never
occupied
a
more
triumphant
position
and
their
prospects
were
never
brighter
than
in
the
summer
of
for
many
years
the
progress
of
their
religion
had
been
incessant
the
most
valuable
of
the
conquests
it
has
retained
were
already
made
and
the
period
of
its
reverses
had
not
begun
the
great
division
which
aided
catholicism
afterwards
to
recover
so
much
lost
ground
was
not
openly
confessed
and
the
effectual
unity
of
the
reformed
churches
was
not
yet
dissolved
in
controversial
theology
the
defence
was
weaker
than
the
attack
the
works
to
which
the
reformation
owed
its
popularity
and
system
were
in
the
hands
of
thousands
while
the
best
authors
of
the
catholic
restoration
had
not
begun
to
write
the
press
continued
to
serve
the
new
opinions
better
than
the
old
and
in
literature
protestantism
was
supreme
persecuted
in
the
south
and
established
by
violence
in
the
north
it
had
overcome
the
resistance
of
princes
in
central
europe
and
had
won
toleration
without
ceasing
to
be
intolerant
in
france
and
poland
in
the
dominions
of
the
emperor
and
under
the
german
prelates
the
attempt
to
arrest
its
advance
by
physical
force
had
been
abandoned
in
germany
it
covered
twice
the
area
that
remained
to
it
in
the
next
generation
and
except
in
bavaria
catholicism
was
fast
dying
out
the
polish
government
had
not
strength
to
persecute
and
poland
became
the
refuge
of
the
sects
when
the
bishops
found
that
they
could
not
prevent
toleration
they
resolved
that
they
would
not
restrict
it
trusting
to
the
maxim
bellum
haereticorum
pax
est
ecclesiae
they
insisted
that
liberty
should
extend
to
those
whom
the
reformers
would
have
exterminated
the
polish
protestants
in
spite
of
their
dissensions
formed
themselves
into
one
great
party
when
the
death
of
the
last
of
the
jagellons
on
the
of
july
made
the
monarchy
elective
they
were
strong
enough
to
enforce
their
conditions
on
the
candidates
and
it
was
thought
that
they
would
be
able
to
decide
the
election
and
obtain
a
king
of
their
own
choosing
alva
reign
of
terror
had
failed
to
pacify
the
low
countries
and
he
was
about
to
resign
the
hopeless
task
to
an
incapable
successor
the
taking
of
the
brill
in
april
was
the
first
of
those
maritime
victories
which
led
to
the
independence
of
the
dutch
mons
fell
in
may
and
in
july
the
important
province
of
holland
declared
for
the
prince
of
orange
the
catholics
believed
that
all
was
lost
if
alva
remained
in
command
the
decisive
struggle
was
in
france
during
the
minority
of
charles
ix
persecution
had
given
way
to
civil
war
and
the
regent
his
mother
had
vainly
striven
by
submitting
to
neither
party
to
uphold
the
authority
of
the
crown
she
checked
the
victorious
catholics
by
granting
to
the
huguenots
terms
which
constituted
them
in
spite
of
continual
disaster
in
the
field
a
vast
and
organised
power
in
the
state
to
escape
their
influence
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invoke
the
help
of
philip
and
to
accept
protection
which
would
have
made
france
subordinate
to
spain
philip
laboured
to
establish
such
an
alliance
and
it
was
to
promote
this
scheme
that
he
sent
his
queen
elizabeth
of
valois
to
meet
her
mother
at
bayonne
in
elizabeth
died
and
a
rumour
came
to
catherine
touching
the
manner
of
her
death
which
made
it
hard
to
listen
to
friendly
overtures
from
her
husband
antonio
perez
at
that
time
an
unscrupulous
instrument
of
his
master
will
afterwards
accused
him
of
having
poisoned
his
wife
on

says
brantôme
after
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
the
ambassador
at
venice
a
man
distinguished
as
a
jurist
and
a
statesman
reproached
catherine
with
having
thrown
france
into
the
hands
of
him
in
whom
the
world
recognised
her
daughter
murderer
catherine
did
not
deny
the
truth
of
the
report
she
replied
that
she
was
bound
to
think
of
her
sons
in
preference
to
her
daughters
that
the
was
not
fully
proved
and
that
if
it
were
it
could
not
be
avenged
so
long
as
france
was
weakened
by
religious
discord
she
wrote
as
she
could
not
have
written
if
she
had
been
convinced
that
the
suspicion
was
unjust
when
charles
ix
began
to
be
his
own
master
he
seemed
resolved
to
follow
his
father
and
grandfather
in
their
hostility
to
the
spanish
power
he
wrote
to
a
trusted
servant
that
all
his
thoughts
were
bent
on
thwarting
philip
while
the
christian
navies
were
fighting
at
lepanto
the
king
of
france
was
treating
with
the
turks
his
menacing
attitude
in
the
following
year
kept
don
juan
in
sicilian
waters
and
made
his
victory
barren
for
christendom
encouraged
by
french
protection
venice
withdrew
from
the
league
even
in
corsica
there
was
a
movement
which
men
interpreted
as
a
prelude
to
the
storm
that
france
was
raising
against
the
empire
of
spain
rome
trembled
in
expectation
of
a
huguenot
invasion
of
italy
for
charles
was
active
in
conciliating
the
protestants
both
abroad
and
at
home
he
married
a
daughter
of
the
tolerant
emperor
maximilian
ii
and
he
carried
on
negotiations
for
the
marriage
of
his
brother
with
queen
elizabeth
not
with
any
hope
of
success
but
in
order
to
impress
public
opinion
he
made
treaties
of
alliance
in
quick
succession
with
england
with
the
german
protestants
and
with
the
prince
of
orange
he
determined
that
his
brother
anjou
the
champion
of
the
catholics
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
had
vowed
to
root
out
the
protestants
to
a
man
should
be
banished
to
the
throne
of
poland
disregarding
the
threats
and
entreaties
of
the
pope
he
gave
his
sister
in
marriage
to
navarre
by
the
peace
of
germains
the
huguenots
had
secured
within
certain
limits
freedom
from
persecution
and
the
liberty
of
persecuting
so
that
pius
declared
that
france
had
been
made
the
slave
of
heretics
coligny
was
now
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
kingdom
his
scheme
for
closing
the
civil
wars
by
an
expedition
for
the
conquest
of
the
netherlands
began
to
be
put
in
motion
french
auxiliaries
followed
lewis
of
nassau
into
mons
an
army
of
huguenots
had
already
gone
to
his
assistance
another
was
being
collected
near
the
frontier
and
coligny
was
preparing
to
take
the
command
in
a
war
which
might
become
a
protestant
crusade
and
which
left
the
catholics
no
hope
of
victory
meanwhile
many
hundreds
of
his
officers
followed
him
to
paris
to
attend
the
wedding
which
was
to
reconcile
the
factions
and
cement
the
peace
of
religion
in
the
midst
of
those
lofty
designs
and
hopes
coligny
was
struck
down
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
he
was
shot
at
and
badly
wounded
two
days
later
he
was
killed
and
a
general
attack
was
made
on
the
huguenots
of
paris
it
lasted
some
weeks
and
was
imitated
in
about
twenty
places
the
chief
provincial
towns
of
france
were
among
them
judged
by
its
immediate
result
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
a
measure
weakly
planned
and
irresolutely
executed
which
deprived
protestantism
of
its
political
leaders
and
left
it
for
a
time
to
the
control
of
zealots
there
is
no
evidence
to
make
it
probable
that
more
than
seven
thousand
victims
perished
judged
by
later
events
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
vast
change
in
the
conflict
of
the
churches
at
first
it
was
believed
that
a
hundred
thousand
huguenots
had
fallen
it
was
said
that
the
survivors
were
abjuring
by
thousands
that
the
children
of
the
slain
were
made
catholics
that
those
whom
the
priest
had
admitted
to
absolution
and
communion
were
nevertheless
put
to
death
men
who
were
far
beyond
the
reach
of
the
french
government
lost
their
faith
in
a
religion
which
providence
had
visited
with
so
tremendous
a
judgment
and
foreign
princes
took
heart
to
employ
severities
which
could
excite
no
horror
after
the
scenes
in
france
contemporaries
were
persuaded
that
the
huguenots
had
been
flattered
and
their
policy
adopted
only
for
their
destruction
and
that
the
murder
of
coligny
and
his
followers
was
a
long
premeditated
crime
catholics
and
protestants
vied
with
each
other
in
detecting
proofs
of
that
which
they
variously
esteemed
a
sign
of
supernatural
inspiration
or
of
diabolical
depravity
in
the
last
forty
years
a
different
opinion
has
prevailed
it
has
been
deemed
more
probable
more
consistent
with
testimony
and
with
the
position
of
affairs
at
the
time
that
coligny
succeeded
in
acquiring
extraordinary
influence
over
the
mind
of
charles
that
his
advice
really
predominated
and
that
the
sanguinary
resolution
was
suddenly
embraced
by
his
adversaries
as
the
last
means
of
regaining
power
this
opinion
is
made
plausible
by
many
facts
it
is
supported
by
several
writers
who
were
then
living
and
by
the
document
known
as
the
confession
of
anjou
the
best
authorities
of
the
present
day
are
nearly
unanimous
in
rejecting
premeditation
the
evidence
on
the
opposite
side
is
stronger
than
they
suppose
the
doom
which
awaited
the
huguenots
had
been
long
expected
and
often
foretold
people
at
a
distance
monluc
in
languedoc
and
the
protestant
mylius
in
italy
drew
the
same
inference
from
the
news
that
came
from
the
court
strangers
meeting
on
the
road
discussed
the
infatuation
of
the
admiral
letters
brought
from
rome
to
the
emperor
the
significant
intimation
that
the
birds
were
all
caged
and
now
was
the
time
to
lay
hands
on
them
the
future
chief
of
the
huguenots
was
so
much
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
coming
evil
that
he
hardly
ventured
into
the
streets
on
the
he
warned
the
admiral
of
the
general
belief
among
their
friends
that
the
marriage
concealed
a
plot
for
their
ruin
and
that
the
festivities
would
end
in
some
horrible
surprise
coligny
was
proof
against
suspicion
several
of
his
followers
left
paris
but
he
remained
unmoved
at
one
moment
the
excessive
readiness
to
grant
all
his
requests
shook
the
confidence
of
his
téligny
but
the
doubt
vanished
so
completely
that
téligny
himself
prevented
the
flight
of
his
partisans
after
the
attempt
on
the
admiral
life
on
the
morning
of
the
fatal
day
montgomery
sent
word
to
walsingham
that
coligny
was
safe
under
protection
of
the
guards
and
that
no
further
stir
was
to
be
apprehended
for
many
years
foreign
advisers
had
urged
catherine
to
make
away
with
these
men
at
first
it
was
computed
that
half
a
dozen
victims
would
be
enough
that
was
the
original
estimate
of
alva
at
bayonne
when
the
duke
of
ferrara
was
in
france
in
he
proposed
a
larger
measure
and
he
repeated
this
advice
by
the
mouth
of
every
agent
whom
he
sent
to
france
after
the
event
both
alva
and
alfonso
reminded
catherine
that
she
had
done
no
more
than
follow
their
advice
letter
explicitly
confirms
the
popular
notion
which
connects
the
massacre
with
the
conference
of
bayonne
and
it
can
no
longer
now
be
doubted
that
la
on
his
deathbed
informed
coligny
that
murderous
resolutions
had
been
taken
on
that
occasion
but
the
nuncio
santa
croce
who
was
present
wrote
to
cardinal
borromeo
that
the
queen
had
indeed
promised
to
punish
the
infraction
of
the
edict
of
pacification
but
that
this
was
a
very
different
thing
from
undertaking
to
extirpate
heresy
catherine
affirmed
that
in
this
way
the
law
could
reach
all
the
huguenot
ministers
and
alva
professed
to
believe
her
whatever
studied
ambiguity
of
language
she
may
have
used
the
action
of
was
uninfluenced
by
deliberations
which
were
seven
years
old
during
the
spring
and
summer
the
tuscan
agents
diligently
prepared
their
master
for
what
was
to
come
petrucci
wrote
on
the
of
march
that
for
a
reason
which
he
could
not
trust
to
paper
the
marriage
would
certainly
take
place
though
not
until
the
huguenots
had
delivered
up
their
strongholds
four
weeks
later
alamanni
announced
that
the
pious
design
for
restoring
unity
of
faith
would
by
the
grace
of
god
be
speedily
accomplished
on
the
of
august
petrucci
was
able
to
report
that
the
plan
arranged
at
bayonne
was
near
execution
yet
he
was
not
fully
initiated
the
queen
afterwards
assured
him
that
she
had
confided
the
secret
to
no
foreign
resident
except
the
nuncio
and
petrucci
resentfully
complains
that
she
had
also
consulted
the
ambassador
of
savoy
venice
like
florence
and
savoy
was
not
taken
by
surprise
in
february
the
ambassador
contarini
explained
to
the
senate
the
specious
tranquillity
in
france
by
saying
that
the
government
reckoned
on
the
death
of
the
admiral
or
the
queen
of
navarre
to
work
a
momentous
change
cavalli
his
successor
judged
that
a
business
so
grossly
mismanaged
showed
no
signs
of
deliberation
there
was
another
venetian
at
paris
who
was
better
informed
the
republic
was
seeking
to
withdraw
from
the
league
against
the
turks
and
her
most
illustrious
statesman
giovanni
michiel
was
sent
to
solicit
the
help
of
france
in
negotiating
peace
the
account
which
he
gave
of
his
mission
has
been
pronounced
by
a
consummate
judge
of
venetian
the
most
valuable
report
of
the
sixteenth
century
he
was
admitted
almost
daily
to
secret
conference
with
anjou
nevers
and
the
group
of
italians
on
whom
the
chief
odium
rests
and
there
was
no
counsellor
to
whom
catherine
more
willingly
gave
ear
michiel
affirms
that
the
intention
had
been
long
entertained
and
that
the
nuncio
had
been
directed
to
reveal
it
privately
to
pius
salviati
was
related
to
catherine
and
had
gained
her
good
opinion
as
nuncio
in
the
year
the
pope
had
sent
him
back
because
nobody
seemed
more
capable
of
diverting
her
and
her
son
from
the
policy
which
caused
so
much
uneasiness
at
rome
he
died
many
years
later
with
the
reputation
of
having
been
one
of
the
most
eminent
cardinals
at
a
time
when
the
sacred
college
was
unusually
rich
in
talent
personally
he
had
always
favoured
stern
measures
of
repression
when
the
countess
of
entremont
was
married
to
coligny
salviati
declared
that
she
had
made
herself
liable
to
severe
penalties
by
entertaining
proposals
of
marriage
with
so
notorious
a
heretic
and
demanded
that
the
duke
of
savoy
should
by
all
the
means
in
his
power
cause
that
wicked
bride
to
be
put
out
of
the
way
when
the
peace
of
germains
was
concluded
he
assured
charles
and
catherine
that
their
lives
were
in
danger
as
the
huguenots
were
seeking
to
pull
down
the
throne
as
well
as
the
altar
he
believed
that
all
intercourse
with
them
was
sinful
and
that
the
sole
remedy
was
utter
extermination
by
the
sword
i
am
convinced
he
wrote
that
it
will
come
to
this
if
they
do
the
tenth
part
of
what
i
have
advised
it
will
be
well
for
them
after
an
audience
of
two
hours
at
which
he
had
presented
a
letter
from
pius
prophesying
the
wrath
of
heaven
salviati
perceived
that
his
exhortations
made
some
impression
the
king
and
queen
whispered
to
him
that
they
hoped
to
make
the
peace
yield
such
fruit
that
the
end
would
more
than
countervail
the
badness
of
the
beginning
and
the
king
added
in
strict
confidence
that
his
plan
was
one
which
once
told
could
never
be
executed
this
might
have
been
said
to
delude
the
nuncio
but
he
was
inclined
on
the
whole
to
believe
that
it
was
sincerely
meant
the
impression
was
confirmed
by
the
archbishop
of
sens
cardinal
pellevé
who
informed
him
that
the
huguenot
leaders
were
caressed
at
court
in
order
to
detach
them
from
their
party
and
that
after
the
loss
of
their
leaders
it
would
not
take
more
than
three
days
to
deal
with
the
rest
salviati
on
his
return
to
france
was
made
aware
that
his
hopes
were
about
to
be
fulfilled
he
shadowed
it
forth
obscurely
in
his
despatches
he
reported
that
the
queen
allowed
the
huguenots
to
pass
into
flanders
believing
that
the
admiral
would
become
more
and
more
presumptuous
until
he
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
retribution
for
she
excelled
in
that
kind
of
intrigue
some
days
later
he
knew
more
and
wrote
that
he
hoped
soon
to
have
good
news
for
his
holiness
at
the
last
moment
his
heart
misgave
him
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
the
duke
of
montpensier
and
the
cardinal
of
bourbon
spoke
with
so
much
unconcern
in
his
presence
of
what
was
then
so
near
that
he
thought
it
hardly
possible
the
secret
could
be
kept
the
foremost
of
the
french
prelates
was
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
he
had
held
a
prominent
position
at
the
council
of
trent
and
for
many
years
he
had
wielded
the
influence
of
the
house
of
guise
over
the
catholics
of
france
in
may
he
went
to
rome
and
he
was
still
there
when
the
news
came
from
paris
in
september
he
at
once
made
it
known
that
the
resolution
had
been
taken
before
he
left
france
and
that
it
was
due
to
himself
and
his
nephew
the
duke
of
guise
as
the
spokesman
of
the
gallican
church
in
the
following
year
he
delivered
a
harangue
to
charles
in
which
he
declared
that
charles
had
eclipsed
the
glory
of
preceding
kings
by
slaying
the
false
prophets
and
especially
by
the
holy
deceit
and
pious
dissimulation
with
which
he
had
laid
his
plans
there
was
one
man
who
did
not
get
his
knowledge
from
rumour
and
who
could
not
be
deceived
by
lies
the
king
confessor
sorbin
afterwards
bishop
of
nevers
published
in
a
narrative
of
the
life
and
death
of
charles
ix
he
bears
unequivocal
testimony
that
that
clement
and
magnanimous
act
for
so
he
terms
it
was
resolved
upon
beforehand
and
he
praises
the
secrecy
as
well
as
the
justice
of
his
hero
early
in
the
year
a
mission
of
extraordinary
solemnity
had
appeared
in
france
pius
who
was
seriously
alarmed
at
the
conduct
of
charles
had
sent
the
cardinal
of
alessandria
as
legate
to
the
kings
of
spain
and
portugal
and
directed
him
in
returning
to
visit
the
court
at
blois
the
legate
was
nephew
to
the
pope
and
the
man
whom
he
most
entirely
trusted
his
character
stood
so
high
that
the
reproach
of
nepotism
was
never
raised
by
his
promotion
several
prelates
destined
to
future
eminence
attended
him
his
chief
adviser
was
hippolyto
aldobrandini
who
twenty
years
later
ascended
the
papal
chair
as
clement
viii
the
companion
whose
presence
conferred
the
greatest
lustre
on
the
mission
was
the
general
of
the
jesuits
francis
borgia
the
holiest
of
the
successors
of
ignatius
and
the
most
venerated
of
men
then
living
austerities
had
brought
him
to
the
last
stage
of
weakness
and
he
was
sinking
under
the
malady
of
which
he
was
soon
to
die
but
it
was
believed
that
the
words
of
such
a
man
pleading
for
the
church
would
sway
the
mind
of
the
king
the
ostensible
purpose
of
the
journey
was
to
break
off
the
match
with
navarre
and
to
bring
france
into
the
holy
league
he
gained
neither
object
when
he
was
summoned
back
to
rome
it
was
understood
in
france
that
he
had
reaped
nothing
but
refusals
and
that
he
went
away
disappointed
the
jeers
of
the
protestants
pursued
him
but
it
was
sufficiently
certain
beforehand
that
france
could
not
plunge
into
a
turkish
war
the
real
business
of
the
legate
besides
proposing
a
catholic
husband
for
the
princess
was
to
ascertain
the
object
of
the
expedition
which
was
fitting
out
in
the
western
ports
on
both
points
he
had
something
favourable
to
report
in
his
last
despatch
dated
lyons
the
of
march
he
wrote
that
he
had
failed
to
prevent
the
engagement
with
navarre
but
that
he
had
something
for
the
pope
private
ear
which
made
his
journey
not
altogether
unprofitable
the
secret
was
soon
divulged
in
italy
the
king
had
met
the
earnest
remonstrances
of
the
legate
by
assuring
him
that
the
marriage
afforded
the
only
prospect
of
wreaking
vengeance
on
the
huguenots
the
event
would
show
he
could
say
no
more
but
desired
his
promise
to
be
carried
to
the
pope
it
was
added
that
he
had
presented
a
ring
to
the
legate
as
a
pledge
of
sincerity
which
the
legate
refused
the
first
to
publish
this
story
was
capilupi
writing
only
seven
months
later
it
was
repeated
by
folieta
and
is
given
with
all
details
by
the
historians
of
pius
catena
and
gabuzzi
catena
was
secretary
to
the
cardinal
of
alessandria
as
early
as
july
and
submitted
his
work
to
him
before
publication
gabuzzi
wrote
at
the
instance
of
the
same
cardinal
who
supplied
him
with
materials
and
his
book
was
examined
and
approved
by
borghese
afterwards
paul
both
the
cardinal
of
alessandria
and
paul
therefore
were
instrumental
in
causing
it
to
be
proclaimed
that
the
legate
was
acquainted
in
february
with
the
intention
which
the
king
carried
out
in
august
the
testimony
of
aldobrandini
was
given
still
more
distinctly
and
with
greater
definiteness
and
authority
when
he
was
required
as
pope
to
pronounce
upon
the
dissolution
of
the
marriage
he
related
to
borghese
and
other
cardinals
what
had
passed
in
that
interview
between
the
legate
and
the
king
adding
that
when
the
report
of
the
massacre
reached
rome
the
cardinal
exclaimed
god
be
praised
the
king
of
france
has
kept
his
word
clement
referred
to
a
narrative
of
the
journey
which
he
had
written
himself
and
in
which
those
things
would
be
found
the
clue
thus
given
has
been
unaccountably
neglected
although
the
report
was
known
to
exist
one
copy
is
mentioned
by
giorgi
and
mazzuchelli
knew
of
another
neither
of
them
had
read
it
for
they
both
ascribe
it
to
michele
bonelli
the
cardinal
of
alessandria
the
first
page
would
have
satisfied
them
that
it
was
not
his
work
clement
viii
describes
the
result
of
the
mission
to
blois
in
these
words

the
opinion
that
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
a
sudden
and
unpremeditated
act
can
not
be
maintained
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
only
alternative
is
to
believe
that
it
was
the
aim
of
every
measure
of
the
government
for
two
years
before
catherine
had
long
contemplated
it
as
her
last
expedient
in
extremity
but
she
had
decided
that
she
could
not
resort
to
it
while
her
son
was
virtually
a
minor
she
suggested
the
idea
to
him
in
in
that
year
he
gave
orders
that
the
huguenots
should
be
slaughtered
at
bourges
the
letter
is
preserved
in
which
la
chastre
spurned
the
command
if
the
people
of
bourges
learn
that
your
majesty
takes
pleasure
in
such
tragedies
they
will
repeat
them
often
if
these
men
must
die
let
them
first
be
tried
but
do
not
reward
my
services
and
sully
my
reputation
by
such
a
stain
in
the
autumn
of
coligny
came
to
blois
walsingham
suspected
and
was
afterwards
convinced
that
the
intention
to
kill
him
already
existed
the
pope
was
much
displeased
by
his
presence
at
court
but
he
received
assurances
from
the
ambassador
which
satisfied
him
it
was
said
at
the
time
that
he
at
first
believed
that
coligny
was
to
be
murdered
but
that
he
soon
found
that
there
was
no
such
praiseworthy
design
in
december
the
king
knew
that
when
the
moment
came
the
burghers
of
paris
would
not
fail
him
marcel
the
prévôt
des
marchands
told
him
that
the
wealth
was
driven
out
of
the
country
by
the
huguenots
the
catholics
will
bear
it
no
longer
let
your
majesty
look
to
it
your
crown
is
at
stake
paris
alone
can
save
it
by
the
month
of
february
the
plan
had
assumed
a
practical
shape
the
political
idea
before
the
mind
of
charles
was
the
same
by
which
richelieu
afterwards
made
france
the
first
power
in
the
world
to
repress
the
protestants
at
home
and
to
encourage
them
abroad
no
means
of
effectual
repression
was
left
but
murder
but
the
idea
of
raising
up
enemies
to
spain
by
means
of
protestantism
was
thoroughly
understood
the
huguenots
were
allowed
to
make
an
expedition
to
aid
william
of
orange
had
they
gained
some
substantial
success
the
government
would
have
followed
it
up
and
the
scheme
of
coligny
would
have
become
for
the
moment
the
policy
of
france
but
the
huguenot
commander
genlis
was
defeated
and
taken
coligny
had
had
his
chance
he
had
played
and
lost
it
was
useless
now
to
propose
his
great
venture
against
the
king
of
spain
philip
ii
perfectly
understood
that
this
event
was
decisive
when
the
news
came
from
hainaut
he
sent
to
the
nuncio
castagna
to
say
that
the
king
of
france
would
gain
more
than
himself
by
the
loss
of
so
many
brave
protestants
and
that
the
time
was
come
for
him
with
the
aid
of
the
people
of
paris
to
get
rid
of
coligny
and
the
rest
of
his
enemies
it
appears
from
the
letters
of
salviati
that
he
also
regarded
the
resolution
as
having
been
finally
taken
after
the
defeat
of
genlis
the
court
had
determined
to
enforce
unity
of
faith
in
france
an
edict
of
toleration
was
issued
for
the
purpose
of
lulling
the
huguenots
but
it
was
well
known
that
it
was
only
a
pretence
strict
injunctions
were
sent
into
the
provinces
that
it
should
not
be
obeyed
and
catherine
said
openly
to
the
english
envoy
my
son
will
have
exercise
but
of
one
religion
in
his
realm
on
the
the
king
explained
his
plan
to
mondoucet
his
agent
at
brussels
since
it
has
pleased
god
to
bring
matters
to
the
point
they
have
now
reached
i
mean
to
use
the
opportunity
to
secure
a
perpetual
repose
in
my
kingdom
and
to
do
something
for
the
good
of
all
christendom
it
is
probable
that
the
conflagration
will
spread
to
every
town
in
france
and
that
they
will
follow
the
example
of
paris
and
lay
hands
on
all
the
protestants
i
have
written
to
the
governors
to
assemble
forces
in
order
to
cut
to
pieces
those
who
may
resist
the
great
object
was
to
accomplish
the
extirpation
of
protestantism
in
such
a
way
as
might
leave
intact
the
friendship
with
protestant
states
every
step
was
governed
by
this
consideration
and
the
difficulty
of
the
task
caused
the
inconsistencies
and
the
vacillation
that
ensued
by
assassinating
coligny
alone
it
was
expected
that
such
an
agitation
would
be
provoked
among
his
partisans
as
would
make
it
appear
that
they
were
killed
by
the
catholics
in
reports
were
circulated
at
once
with
that
object
a
letter
written
on
the
states
that
after
the
admiral
was
wounded
on
the
day
before
the
huguenots
assembled
at
the
gate
of
the
louvre
to
avenge
him
on
the
guises
as
they
came
out
and
the
first
explanation
sent
forth
by
the
government
on
the
was
to
the
effect
that
the
old
feud
between
the
houses
of
guise
and
of
châtillon
had
broken
out
with
a
fury
which
it
was
impossible
to
quell
this
fable
lasted
only
for
a
single
day
on
the
charles
writes
that
he
has
begun
to
discover
traces
of
a
huguenot
conspiracy
and
on
the
following
day
this
was
publicly
substituted
for
the
original
story
neither
the
vendetta
of
the
guises
nor
the
conspiracy
at
paris
could
be
made
to
explain
the
massacre
in
the
provinces
it
required
to
be
so
managed
that
the
king
could
disown
it
salviati
describes
the
plan
of
operations
it
was
intended
that
the
huguenots
should
be
slaughtered
successively
by
a
series
of
spontaneous
outbreaks
in
different
parts
of
the
country
while
rochelle
held
out
it
was
dangerous
to
proceed
with
a
more
sweeping
method
accordingly
no
written
instructions
from
the
king
are
in
existence
and
the
governors
were
expressly
informed
that
they
were
to
expect
none
messengers
went
into
the
provinces
with
letters
requiring
that
the
verbal
orders
which
they
brought
should
be
obeyed
many
governors
refused
to
act
upon
directions
so
vague
and
so
hard
to
verify
burgundy
was
preserved
in
this
way
two
gentlemen
arrived
with
letters
of
recommendation
from
the
king
and
declared
his
commands
they
were
asked
to
put
them
on
paper
but
they
refused
to
give
in
writing
what
they
had
received
by
word
of
mouth
mandelot
the
governor
of
lyons
the
most
ignoble
of
the
instruments
in
this
foul
deed
complained
that
the
intimation
of
the
royal
wishes
sent
to
him
was
obscure
and
insufficient
he
did
not
do
his
work
thoroughly
and
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
king
the
orders
were
complicated
as
well
as
obscure
the
public
authorities
were
required
to
collect
the
huguenots
in
some
prison
or
other
safe
place
where
they
could
be
got
at
by
hired
bands
of
volunteer
assassins
to
screen
the
king
it
was
desirable
that
his
officers
should
not
superintend
the
work
themselves
mandelot
having
locked
the
gates
of
lyons
and
shut
up
the
huguenots
together
took
himself
out
of
the
way
while
they
were
being
butchered
carouge
at
rouen
received
a
commission
to
visit
the
other
towns
in
his
province
the
magistrates
implored
him
to
remain
as
nobody
in
his
absence
could
restrain
the
people
when
the
king
had
twice
repeated
his
commands
carouge
obeyed
and
five
hundred
huguenots
perished
it
was
thought
unsafe
even
for
the
king
brother
to
give
distinct
orders
under
his
own
hand
he
wrote
to
his
lieutenant
in
anjou
that
he
had
commissioned
puygaillard
to
communicate
with
him
on
a
matter
which
concerned
the
king
service
and
his
own
and
desired
that
his
orders
should
be
received
as
if
they
came
directly
from
himself
they
were
that
every
huguenot
in
angers
saumur
and
the
adjoining
country
should
be
put
to
death
without
delay
and
without
exception
the
duke
of
montpensier
himself
sent
the
same
order
to
brittany
but
it
was
indignantly
rejected
by
the
municipality
of
nantes
when
reports
came
in
of
the
manner
in
which
the
event
had
been
received
in
foreign
countries
the
government
began
to
waver
and
the
sanguinary
orders
were
recalled
schomberg
wrote
from
germany
that
the
protestant
allies
were
lost
unless
they
could
be
satisfied
that
the
king
had
not
decreed
the
extermination
of
their
brethren
he
was
instructed
to
explain
the
tumult
in
the
provinces
by
the
animosity
bequeathed
by
the
wars
of
religion
the
bishop
of
valence
was
intriguing
in
poland
on
behalf
of
anjou
he
wrote
that
his
success
had
been
made
very
doubtful
and
that
if
further
cruelties
were
perpetrated
ten
millions
of
gold
pieces
would
not
bribe
the
venal
poles
he
advised
that
a
counterfeit
edict
at
least
should
be
published
charles
perceived
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
abandon
his
enterprise
and
set
about
appeasing
the
resentment
of
the
protestant
powers
he
promised
that
an
inquiry
should
be
instituted
and
the
proofs
of
the
conspiracy
communicated
to
foreign
governments
to
give
a
judicial
aspect
to
the
proceedings
two
prominent
huguenots
were
ceremoniously
hanged
when
the
new
ambassador
from
spain
praised
the
long
concealment
of
the
plan
charles
became
indignant
it
was
repeated
everywhere
that
the
thing
had
been
arranged
with
rome
and
spain
and
he
was
especially
studious
that
there
should
be
no
symptoms
of
a
private
understanding
with
either
power
he
was
able
to
flatter
himself
that

had
at

succeeded

his

elizabeth
consented
to
stand
godmother
to

daughter
who
was
born
to
him
in

he
was
allowed
to

in

and
the

protestants
agreed
to
the
election
of
his

the
promised
evidence
of
the
huguenot
conspiracy
was
forgotten
and
the
king
suppressed
the
materials
which
were
to
have
served
for
an
official
history
of
the
event
zeal
for
religion
was
not
the
motive
which
inspired
the
chief
authors
of
this
extraordinary
crime
they
were
trained
to
look
on
the
safety
of
the
monarchy
as
the
sovereign
law
and
on
the
throne
as
an
idol
that
justified
sins
committed
in
its
worship
at
all
times
there
have
been
men
resolute
and
relentless
in
the
pursuit
of
their
aims
whose
ardour
was
too
strong
to
be
restricted
by
moral
barriers
or
the
instinct
of
humanity
in
the
sixteenth
century
beside
the
fanaticism
of
freedom
there
was
an
abject
idolatry
of
power
and
laws
both
human
and
divine
were
made
to
yield
to
the
intoxication
of
authority
and
the
reign
of
will
it
was
laid
down
that
kings
have
the
right
of
disposing
of
the
lives
of
their
subjects
and
may
dispense
with
the
forms
of
justice
the
church
herself
whose
supreme
pontiff
was
now
an
absolute
monarch
was
infected
with
this
superstition
catholic
writers
found
an
opportune
argument
for
their
religion
in
the
assertion
that
it
makes
the
prince
master
of
the
consciences
as
well
as
the
bodies
of
the
people
and
enjoins
submission
even
to
the
vilest
tyranny
men
whose
lives
were
precious
to
the
catholic
cause
could
be
murdered
by
royal
command
without
protest
from
rome
when
the
duke
of
guise
with
the
cardinal
his
brother
was
slain
by
henry
he
was
the
most
powerful
and
devoted
upholder
of
catholicism
in
france
sixtus
thundered
against
the
sacrilegious
tyrant
who
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
a
prince
of
the
church
but
he
let
it
be
known
very
distinctly
that
the
death
of
the
duke
caused
him
little
concern
catherine
was
the
daughter
of
that
medici
to
whom
machiavelli
had
dedicated
his
so
little
did
religion
actuate
her
conduct
that
she
challenged
elizabeth
to
do
to
the
catholics
of
england
what
she
herself
had
done
to
the
protestants
of
france
promising
that
if
they
were
destroyed
there
would
be
no
loss
of
her
good
will
the
levity
of
her
religious
feelings
appears
from
her
reply
when
asked
by
gomicourt
what
message
he
should
take
to
the
duke
of
alva
i
must
give

and
she
added
beatus

in
me
scandalizatus
if
mere
fanaticism
had
been
their
motive
the
men
who
were
most
active
in
the
massacre
would
not
have
spared
so
many
lives
while
guise
was
galloping
after
ferrières
and
montgomery
who
had
taken
horse
betimes
and
made
for
the
coast
his
house
at
paris
was
crowded
with
families
belonging
to
the
proscribed
faith
and
strangers
to
him
a
young
girl
who
was
amongst
them
has
described
his
return
when
he
sent
for
the
children
spoke
to
them
kindly
and
gave
orders
that
they
should
be
well
treated
as
long
as
his
roof
sheltered
them
protestants
even
spoke
of
him
as
a
humane
and
chivalrous
enemy
nevers
was
considered
to
have
disgraced
himself
by
the
number
of
those
whom
he
enabled
to
escape
the
nuncio
was
shocked
at
their
generosity
he
reported
to
rome
that
the
only
one
who
had
acted
in
the
spirit
of
a
christian
and
had
refrained
from
mercy
was
the
king
while
the
other
princes
who
pretended
to
be
good
catholics
and
to
deserve
the
favour
of
the
pope
had
striven
one
and
all
to
save
as
many
huguenots
as
they
could
the
worst
criminals
were
not
the
men
who
did
the
deed
the
crime
of
mobs
and
courtiers
infuriated
by
the
lust
of
vengeance
and
of
power
is
not
so
strange
a
portent
as
the
exultation
of
peaceful
men
influenced
by
no
present
injury
or
momentary
rage
but
by
the
permanent
and
incurable
perversion
of
moral
sense
wrought
by
a
distorted
piety
philip
who
had
long
suspected
the
court
of
france
was
at
once
relieved
from
the
dread
which
had
oppressed
him
and
betrayed
an
excess
of
joy
foreign
to
his
phlegmatic
nature
he
immediately
sent
six
thousand
crowns
to
the
murderer
of
coligny
he
persuaded
himself
that
the
breach
between
france
and
her
allies
was
irreparable
that
charles
would
now
be
driven
to
seek
his
friendship
and
that
the
netherlands
were
out
of
danger
he
listened
readily
to
the
french
ambassador
who
assured
him
that
his
court
had
never
swerved
from
the
line
of
catholic
policy
but
had
intended
all
along
to
effect
this
great
change
ayamonte
carried
his
congratulations
to
paris
and
pretended
that
his
master
had
been
in
the
secret
it
suited
philip
that
this
should
be
believed
by
protestant
princes
in
order
to
estrange
them
still
more
from
france
but
he
wrote
on
the
margin
of
instructions
that
it
was
uncertain
how
long
previously
the
purpose
had
subsisted
juan
and
diego
de
zuñiga
his
ambassadors
at
rome
and
at
paris
were
convinced
that
the
long
display
of
enmity
to
spain
was
genuine
that
the
death
of
coligny
had
been
decided
at
the
last
moment
and
that
the
rest
was
not
the
effect
of
design
this
opinion
found
friends
at
first
in
spain
the
general
of
the
franciscans
undertook
to
explode
it
he
assured
philip
that
he
had
seen
the
king
and
the
two
years
before
and
had
found
them
already
so
intent
on
the
massacre
that
he
wondered
how
anybody
could
have
the
courage
to
detract
from
their
merit
by
denying
it
this
view
generally
prevailed
in
spain
mendoça
knows
not
which
to
admire
more
the
loyal
and
catholic
inhabitants
of
paris
or
charles
who
justified
his
title
of
the
most
christian
king
by
helping
with
his
own
hands
to
slaughter
his
subjects
mariana
witnessed
the
carnage
and
imagined
that
it
must
gladden
every
catholic
heart
other
spaniards
were
gratified
to
think
that
it
had
been
contrived
with
alva
at
bayonne
alva
himself
did
not
judge
the
event
by
the
same
light
as
philip
he
also
had
distrusted
the
french
government
but
he
had
not
feared
it
during
the
ascendency
of
the
huguenots
their
fall
appeared
to
him
to
strengthen
france
in
public
he
rejoiced
with
the
rest
he
complimented
charles
on
his
valour
and
his
religion
and
claimed
his
own
share
of
merit
but
he
warned
philip
that
things
had
not
changed
favourably
for
spain
and
that
the
king
of
france
was
now
a
formidable
neighbour
for
himself
he
said
he
never
would
have
committed
so
base
a
deed
the
seven
catholic
cantons
had
their
own
reason
for
congratulation
their
countrymen
had
been
busy
actors
on
the
scene
and
three
soldiers
of
the
swiss
guard
of
anjou
were
named
as
the
slayers
of
the
admiral
on
the
of
october
they
agreed
to
raise
men
for
the
king
service
at
the
following
diet
they
demanded
the
expulsion
of
the
fugitive
huguenots
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
protestant
parts
of
the
confederation
they
made
overtures
to
the
pope
for
a
secret
alliance
against
their
confederates
in
italy
where
the
life
of
a
heretic
was
cheap
their
wholesale
destruction
was
confessed
a
highly
politic
and
ingenious
act
even
the
sage
venetians
were
constrained
to
celebrate
it
with
a
procession
the
grand
duke
cosmo
had
pointed
out
two
years
before
that
an
insidious
peace
would
afford
excellent
opportunities
of
extinguishing
protestantism
and
he
derived
inexpressible
consolation
from
the
heroic
enterprise
the
viceroy
of
naples
cardinal
granvelle
received
the
tidings
coldly
he
was
surprised
that
the
event
had
been
so
long
postponed
and
he
reproved
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
for
the
unstatesmanlike
delay
the
italians
generally
were
excited
to
warmer
feelings
they
saw
nothing
to
regret
but
the
death
of
certain
catholics
who
had
been
sacrificed
to
private
revenge
profane
men
approved
the
skill
with
which
the
trap
was
laid
and
pious
men
acknowledged
the
presence
of
a
genuine
religious
spirit
in
the
french
court
the
nobles
and
the
parisian
populace
were
admired
for
their
valour
in
obeying
the
sanctified
commands
of
the
good
king
one
fervent
enthusiast
praises
god
for
the
heavenly
news
and
also
bartholomew
for
having
lent
his
extremely
penetrating
knife
for
the
salutary
sacrifice
a
month
after
the
event
the
renowned
preacher
panigarola
delivered
from
the
pulpit
a
panegyric
on
the
monarch
who
had
achieved
what
none
had
ever
heard
or
read
before
by
banishing
heresy
in
a
single
day
and
by
a
single
word
from
the
christian
land
of
france
the
french
churches
had
often
resounded
with
furious
declamations
and
they
afterwards
rang
with
canticles
of
unholy
joy
but
the
french
clergy
does
not
figure
prominently
in
the
inception
or
the
execution
of
the
sanguinary
decree
conti
a
contemporary
indeed
but
too
distant
for
accurate
knowledge
relates
that
the
parish
priest
went
round
marking
with
a
white
cross
the
dwellings
of
the
people
who
were
doomed
he
is
contradicted
by
the
municipal
registers
of
paris
morvilliers
bishop
of
orleans
though
he
had
resigned
the
seals
which
he
received
from
still
occupied
the
first
place
at
the
royal
council
he
was
consulted
at
the
last
moment
and
it
is
said
that
he
nearly
fainted
with
horror
he
recovered
and
gave
his
opinion
with
the
rest
he
is
the
only
french
prelate
except
the
cardinals
whose
complicity
appears
to
be
ascertained
but
at
orleans
where
the
bloodshed
was
more
dreadful
in
proportion
than
at
paris
the
signal
is
said
to
have
been
given
not
by
the
bishop
but
by
the
king
preacher
sorbin
sorbin
is
the
only
priest
of
the
capital
who
is
distinctly
associated
with
the
act
of
the
government
it
was
his
opinion
that
god
has
ordained
that
no
mercy
shall
be
shown
to
heretics
that
charles
was
bound
in
conscience
to
do
what
he
did
and
that
leniency
would
have
been
as
censurable
in
his
case
as
precipitation
was
in
that
of
theodosius
what
the
calvinists
called
perfidy
and
cruelty
seemed
to
him
nothing
but
generosity
and
kindness
these
were
the
sentiments
of
the
man
from
whose
hands
charles
ix
received
the
last
consolations
of
his
religion
it
has
been
related
that
he
was
tortured
in
his
last
moments
with
remorse
for
the
blood
he
had
shed
his
spiritual
adviser
was
fitted
to
dispel
such
scruples
he
tells
us
that
he
heard
the
last
confession
of
the
dying
king
and
that
his
most
grievous
sorrow
was
that
he
left
the
work
unfinished
in
all
that
bloodstained
history
there
is
nothing
more
tragic
than
the
scene
in
which
the
last
words
preparing
the
soul
for
judgment
were
spoken
by
such
a
confessor
as
sorbin
to
such
a
penitent
as
charles
edmond
auger
one
of
the
most
able
and
eloquent
of
the
jesuits
was
at
that
time
attracting
multitudes
by
his
sermons
at
bordeaux
he
denounced
with
so
much
violence
the
heretics
and
the
people
in
authority
who
protected
them
that
the
magistrates
fearing
a
cry
for
blood
proposed
to
silence
or
to
moderate
the
preacher
montpezat
lieutenant
of
guienne
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
it
on
the
of
september
he
wrote
to
the
king
that
he
had
done
this
and
that
there
were
a
score
of
the
inhabitants
who
might
be
despatched
with
advantage
three
days
later
when
he
was
gone
more
than
two
hundred
huguenots
were
murdered
apart
from
these
two
instances
it
is
not
known
that
the
clergy
interfered
in
any
part
of
france
to
encourage
the
assassins
the
belief
was
common
at
the
time
and
is
not
yet
extinct
that
the
massacre
had
been
promoted
and
sanctioned
by
the
court
of
rome
no
evidence
of
this
complicity
prior
to
the
event
has
ever
been
produced
but
it
seemed
consistent
with
what
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
in
the
affair
of
the
dispensation
the
marriage
of
margaret
of
valois
with
the
king
of
navarre
was
invalid
and
illicit
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
and
it
was
known
that
pius
had
sworn
that
he
would
never
permit
it
when
it
had
been
celebrated
by
a
cardinal
in
the
presence
of
a
splendid
court
and
no
more
was
heard
of
resistance
on
the
part
of
rome
the
world
concluded
that
the
dispensation
had
been
obtained
de
thou
says
in
a
manuscript
note
that
it
had
been
sent
and
was
afterwards
suppressed
by
salviati
and
the
french
bishop
spondanus
assigns
the
reasons
which
induced
gregory
xiii
to
give
way
others
affirmed
that
he
had
yielded
when
he
learned
that
the
marriage
was
a
snare
so
that
the
massacre
was
the
price
of
the
dispensation
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
gave
currency
to
the
story
as
he
caused
it
to
be
understood
that
he
had
been
in
the
secret
it
seemed
probable
that
he
had
told
the
pope
for
they
had
been
old
friends
in
the
commemorative
inscription
which
he
put
up
in
the
church
of
lewis
he
spoke
of
the
king
gratitude
to
the
holy
see
for
its
assistance
and
for
its
advice
in
the
matter
consiliorum
ad
eam
rem
datorum
it
is
probable
that
he
inspired
the
narrative
which
has
contributed
most
to
sustain
the
imputation
among
the
italians
of
the
french
faction
who
made
it
their
duty
to
glorify
the
act
of
charles
the
capilupi
family
was
conspicuous
they
came
from
mantua
and
appear
to
have
been
connected
with
the
french
interest
through
lewis
gonzaga
who
had
become
by
marriage
duke
of
nevers
and
one
of
the
foremost
personages
in
france
hippolyto
capilupi
bishop
of

formerly
nuncio
at

resided
at
rome
busy
with
french
politics
and
latin
poetry
when
charles
refused
to
join
the
league
the
bishop
of
fano
vindicated
his
neutrality
in
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
urbino
when
he
slew
the
huguenots

a

bard
held
office
about
the
person
of
the
pope
and
was
employed
on
missions
of
consequence
as
soon
as
the
news
from
paris
reached
rome
he
drew
up
the
account
which
became
so
famous
under
the
title
of
stratagemma
di
carlo
the
dedication
is
dated
the
of
september
this
tract
was
suppressed
and
was
soon
so
rare
that
its
existence
was
unknown
in
to
the
french
translator
of
the
second
edition
capilupi
republished
his
book
with
alterations
and
a
preface
dated
the
of
october
the
substance
and
purpose
of
the
two
editions
is
the
same
capilupi
is
not
the
official
organ
of
the
roman
court
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
the
letters
of
the
nuncio
he
wrote
to
proclaim
the
praises
of
the
king
of
france
and
the
duke
of
nevers
at
that
moment
the
french
party
in
rome
was
divided
by
the
quarrel
between
the
ambassador
ferralz
and
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
who
had
contrived
to
get
the
management
of
french
affairs
into
his
own
hands
capilupi
was
on
the
side
of
the
cardinal
and
received
information
from
those
who
were
about
him
the
chief
anxiety
of
these
men
was
that
the
official
version
which
attributed
the
massacre
to
a
huguenot
conspiracy
should
obtain
no
credence
at
rome
if
the
cardinal
enemies
were
overthrown
without
his
participation
it
would
confirm
the
report
that
he
had
become
a
cipher
in
the
state
he
desired
to
vindicate
for
himself
and
his
family
the
authorship
of
the
catastrophe
catherine
could
not
tolerate
their
claim
to
a
merit
which
she
had
made
her
own
and
there
was
competition
between
them
for
the
first
and
largest
share
in
the
gratitude
of
the
holy
see
lorraine
prevailed
with
the
pope
who
not
only
loaded
him
with
honours
but
rewarded
him
with
benefices
worth
crowns
a
year
for
his
nephew
and
a
gift
of
crowns
for
his
son
but
he
found
that
he
had
fallen
into
disgrace
at
paris
and
feared
for
his
position
at
rome
in
these
circumstances
capilupi
book
appeared
and
enumerated
a
series
of
facts
proving
that
the
cardinal
was
cognisant
of
the
royal
design
it
adds
little
to
the
evidence
of
premeditation
capilupi
relates
that
santa
croce
returning
from
france
had
assured
pius
in
the
name
of
catherine
that
she
intended
one
day
to
entrap
coligny
and
to
make
a
signal
butchery
of
him
and
his
adherents
and
that
letters
in
which
the
queen
renewed
this
promise
to
the
pope
had
been
read
by
credible
witnesses
santa
croce
was
living
and
did
not
contradict
the
statement
the
had
originally
stated
that
lorraine
had
informed
sermoneta
of
the
project
soon
after
he
arrived
at
rome
in
the
reprint
this
passage
was
omitted
the
book
had
therefore
undergone
a
censorial
revision
which
enhances
the
authenticity
of
the
final
narrative
two
other
pieces
are
extant
which
were
printed
at
the
stamperia
camerale
and
show
what
was
believed
at
rome
one
is
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
written
at
lyons
in
the
midst
of
scenes
of
death
and
describing
what
the
author
had
witnessed
on
the
spot
and
what
he
heard
from
paris
he
reports
that
the
king
had
positively
commanded
that
not
one
huguenot
should
escape
and
was
overjoyed
at
the
accomplishment
of
his
orders
he
believes
the
thing
to
have
been
premeditated
and
inspired
by
divine
justice
the
other
tract
is
remarkable
because
it
strives
to
reconcile
the
pretended
conspiracy
with
the
hypothesis
of
premeditation
there
were
two
plots
which
went
parallel
for
months
the
king
knew
that
coligny
was
compassing
his
death
and
deceived
him
by
feigning
to
enter
into
his
plan
for
the
invasion
of
the
low
countries
and
coligny
allowing
himself
to
be
overreached
summoned
his
friends
to
paris
for
the
purpose
of
killing
charles
on
the
of
august
the
writer
expects
that
there
will
soon
be
no
huguenots
in
france
capilupi
at
first
borrowed
several
of
his
facts
which
he
afterwards
corrected
the
real
particulars
relative
to
the
marriage
are
set
forth
minutely
in
the
correspondence
of
ferralz
and
they
absolutely
contradict
the
supposition
of
the
complicity
of
rome
it
was
celebrated
in
flagrant
defiance
of
the
pope
who
persisted
in
refusing
the
dispensation
and
therefore
acted
in
a
way
which
could
only
serve
to
mar
the
plot
the
accusation
has
been
kept
alive
by
his
conduct
after
the
event
the
jesuit
who
wrote
his
life
by
desire
of
his
son
says
that
gregory
thanked
god
in
private
but
that
in
public
he
gave
signs
of
a
tempered
joy
but
the
illuminations
and
processions
the
singing
of
te
deum
and
the
firing
of
the
castle
guns
the
jubilee
the
medal
and
the
paintings
whose
faded
colours
still
vividly
preserve
to
our
age
the
passions
of
that
day
nearly
exhaust
the
modes
by
which
a
pope
could
manifest
delight
charles
ix
and
salviati
both
wrote
to
rome
on
bartholomew
day
and
the
ambassador
nephew
beauville
set
off
with
the
tidings
they
were
known
before
he
arrived
on
the
mandelot
secretary
despatched
a
secret
messenger
from
lyons
with
orders
to
inform
the
pope
that
the
huguenot
leaders
were
slain
and
that
their
adherents
were
to
be
secured
all
over
france
the
messenger
reached
rome
on
the
of
september
and
was
immediately
carried
to
the
pope
by
the
cardinal
of
lorraine
gregory
rewarded
him
for
the
welcome
intelligence
with
a
present
of
a
hundred
crowns
and
desired
that
rome
should
be
at
once
illuminated
this
was
prevented
by
ferralz
who
tried
the
patience
of
the
romans
by
declining
their
congratulations
as
long
as
he
was
not
officially
informed
beauville
and
the
courier
of
the
nuncio
arrived
on
the
the
king
letter
like
all
that
he
wrote
on
the
first
day
ascribed
the
outbreak
to
the
old
hatred
between
the
rival
houses
and
to
the
late
attempt
on
the
admiral
life
he
expressed
a
hope
that
the
dispensation
would
not
now
be
withheld
but
left
all
particulars
to
beauville
whose
own
eyes
had
beheld
the
scene
beauville
told
his
story
and
repeated
the
king
request
but
gregory
though
much
gratified
with
what
he
heard
remained
inflexible
salviati
had
written
on
the
afternoon
of
the
he
desired
to
fling
himself
at
the
pope
feet
to
wish
him
joy
his
fondest
hopes
had
been
surpassed
although
he
had
known
what
was
in
store
for
coligny
he
had
not
expected
that
there
would
be
energy
and
prudence
to
seize
the
occasion
for
the
destruction
of
the
rest
a
new
era
had
commenced
a
new
compass
was
required
for
french
affairs
it
was
a
fair
sight
to
see
the
catholics
in
the
streets
wearing
white
crosses
and
cutting
down
heretics
and
it
was
thought
that
as
fast
as
the
news
spread
the
same
thing
would
be
done
in
all
the
towns
of
france
this
letter
was
read
before
the
assembled
cardinals
at
the
venetian
palace
and
they
thereupon
attended
the
pope
to
a
te
deum
in
the
nearest
church
the
guns
of
angelo
were
fired
in
the
evening
and
the
city
was
illuminated
for
three
nights
to
disregard
the
pope
will
in
this
respect
would
have
savoured
of
heresy
gregory
xiii
exclaimed
that
the
massacre
was
more
agreeable
to
him
than
fifty
victories
of
lepanto
for
some
weeks
the
news
from
the
french
provinces
sustained
the
rapture
and
excitement
of
the
court
it
was
hoped
that
other
countries
would
follow
the
example
of
france
the
emperor
was
informed
that
something
of
the
same
kind
was
expected
of
him
on
the
of
september
the
pope
went
in
procession
to
the
french
church
of
lewis
where
cardinals
attended
at
a
mass
of
thanksgiving
on
the
he
proclaimed
a
jubilee
in
the
bull
he
said
that
forasmuch
as
god
had
armed
the
king
of
france
to
inflict
vengeance
on
the
heretics
for
the
injuries
done
to
religion
and
to
punish
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
which
had
devastated
his
kingdom
catholics
should
pray
that
he
might
have
grace
to
pursue
his
auspicious
enterprise
to
the
end
and
so
complete
what
he
had
begun
so
well
before
a
month
had
passed
vasari
was
summoned
from
florence
to
decorate
the
hall
of
kings
with
paintings
of
the
massacre
the
work
was
pronounced
his
masterpiece
and
the
shameful
scene
may
still
be
traced
upon
the
wall
where
for
three
centuries
it
has
insulted
every
pontiff
that
entered
the
sixtine
chapel
the
story
that
the
huguenots
had
perished
because
they
were
detected
plotting
the
king
death
was
known
at
rome
on
the
of
september
while
the
sham
edict
and
the
imaginary
trial
served
to
confirm
it
in
the
eyes
of
europe
catherine
and
her
son
took
care
that
it
should
not
deceive
the
pope
they
assured
him
that
they
meant
to
disregard
the
edict
to
excuse
his
sister
marriage
the
king
pleaded
that
it
had
been
concluded
for
no
object
but
vengeance
and
he
promised
that
there
would
soon
be
not
a
heretic
in
the
country
this
was
corroborated
by
salviati
as
to
the
proclaimed
toleration
he
knew
that
it
was
a
device
to
disarm
foreign
enmity
and
prevent
a
popular
commotion
he
testified
that
the
queen
spoke
truly
when
she
said
that
she
had
confided
to
him
long
before
the
real
purpose
of
her
engagement
he
exposed
the
hollow
pretence
of
the
plot
he
announced
that
its
existence
would
be
established
by
formalities
of
law
but
added
that
it
was
so
notoriously
false
that
none
but
an
idiot
could
believe
in
it
gregory
gave
no
countenance
to
the
official
falsehood
at
the
reception
of
the
french
ambassador
rambouillet
on
the
of
december
muretus
made
his
famous
speech
he
said
that
there
could
not
have
been
a
happier
beginning
for
a
new
pontificate
and
alluded
to
the
fabulous
plot
in
the
tone
exacted
of
french
officials
the
secretary
boccapaduli
replying
in
behalf
of
the
pope
thanked
the
king
for
destroying
the
enemies
of
christ
but
strictly
avoided
the
conventional
fable
cardinal
orsini
went
as
legate
to
france
he
had
been
appointed
in
august
and
he
was
to
try
to
turn
the
king
course
into
that
line
of
policy
from
which
he
had
strayed
under
protestant
guidance
he
had
not
left
rome
when
the
events
occurred
which
altered
the
whole
situation
orsini
was
now
charged
with
felicitations
and
was
to
urge
charles
not
to
stop
an
ancient
and
obsolete
ceremonial
was
suddenly
revived
and
the
cardinals
accompanied
him
to
the
flaminian
gate
this
journey
of
orsini
and
the
pomp
with
which
it
was
surrounded
were
exceedingly
unwelcome
at
paris
it
was
likely
to
be
taken
as
proof
of
that
secret
understanding
with
rome
which
threatened
to
rend
the
delicate
web
in
which
charles
was
striving
to
hold
the
confidence
of
the
protestant
world
he
requested
that
the
legate
might
be
recalled
and
the
pope
was
willing
that
there
should
be
some
delay
while
orsini
tarried
on
his
way
gregory
reply
to
the
announcement
of
the
massacre
arrived
at
paris
it
was
a
great
consolation
to
himself
he
said
and
an
extraordinary
grace
vouchsafed
to
christendom
but
he
desired
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
france
that
the
huguenots
should
be
extirpated
utterly
and
with
that
view
he
demanded
the
revocation
of
the
edict
when
catherine
knew
that
the
pope
was
not
yet
satisfied
and
sought
to
direct
the
actions
of
the
king
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
rage
salviati
had
never
seen
her
so
furious
the
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
when
she
exclaimed
that
she
wondered
at
such
designs
and
was
resolved
to
tolerate
no
interference
in
the
government
of
the
kingdom
she
and
her
son
were
catholics
from
conviction
and
not
through
fear
or
influence
let
the
pope
content
himself
with
that
the
nuncio
had
at
once
foreseen
that
the
court
after
crushing
the
huguenots
would
not
become
more
amenable
to
the
counsels
of
rome
he
wrote
on
the
very
day
of
bartholomew
that
the
king
would
be
very
jealous
of
his
authority
and
would
exact
obedience
from
both
sides
alike
at
this
untoward
juncture
orsini
appeared
at
court
to
charles
who
had
done
so
much
it
seemed
unreasonable
that
he
should
be
asked
for
more
he
represented
to
orsini
that
it
was
impossible
to
eradicate
all
the
remnants
of
a
faction
which
had
been
so
strong
he
had
put
seventy
thousand
huguenots
to
the
sword
and
if
he
had
shown
compassion
to
the
rest
it
was
in
order
that
they
might
become
good
catholics
the
hidden
thoughts
which
the
court
of
rome
betrayed
by
its
conduct
on
this
memorable
occasion
have
brought
upon
the
pope
himself
an
amount
of
hatred
greater
than
he
deserved
gregory
xiii
appears
as
a
pale
figure
between
the
two
strongest
of
the
modern
popes
without
the
intense
zeal
of
the
one
and
the
ruthless
volition
of
the
other
he
was
not
prone
to
large
conceptions
or
violent
resolutions
he
had
been
converted
late
in
life
to
the
spirit
of
the
tridentine
reformation
and
when
he
showed
rigour
it
was
thought
to
be
not
in
his
character
but
in
the
counsels
of
those
who
influenced
him
he
did
not
instigate
the
crime
nor
the
atrocious
sentiments
that
hailed
it
in
the
religious
struggle
a
frenzy
had
been
kindled
which
made
weakness
violent
and
turned
good
men
into
prodigies
of
ferocity
and
at
rome
where
every
loss
inflicted
on
catholicism
and
every
wound
was
felt
the
belief
that
in
dealing
with
heretics
murder
is
better
than
toleration
prevailed
for
half
a
century
the
predecessor
of
gregory
had
been
in
his
eyes
protestants
were
worse
than
pagans
and
lutherans
more
dangerous
than
other
protestants
the
capuchin
preacher
pistoja
bore
witness
that
men
were
hanged
and
quartered
almost
daily
at
rome
and
pius
declared
that
he
would
release
a
culprit
guilty
of
a
hundred
murders
rather
than
one
obstinate
heretic
he
seriously
contemplated
razing
the
town
of
faenza
because
it
was
infested
with
religious
error
and
he
recommended
a
similar
expedient
to
the
king
of
france
he
adjured
him
to
hold
no
intercourse
with
the
huguenots
to
make
no
terms
with
them
and
not
to
observe
the
terms
he
had
made
he
required
that
they
should
be
pursued
to
the
death
that
not
one
should
be
spared
under
any
pretence
that
all
prisoners
should
suffer
death
he
threatened
charles
with
the
punishment
of
saul
when
he
forebore
to
exterminate
the
amalekites
he
told
him
that
it
was
his
mission
to
avenge
the
injuries
of
the
lord
and
that
nothing
is
more
cruel
than
mercy
to
the
impious
when
he
sanctioned
the
murder
of
elizabeth
he
proposed
that
it
should
be
done
in
execution
of
his
sentence
against
her
it
became
usual
with
those
who
meditated
assassination
or
regicide
on
the
plea
of
religion
to
look
upon
the
representatives
of
rome
as
their
natural
advisers
on
the
of
january
a
young
capuchin
came
by
permission
of
his
superiors
to
sega
bishop
of
piacenza
then
nuncio
at
paris
he
said
that
he
was
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
a
martyr
death
and
having
been
assured
by
divines
that
it
would
be
meritorious
to
kill
that
heretic
and
tyrant
henry
of
navarre
he
asked
to
be
dispensed
from
the
rule
of
his
order
while
he
prepared
his
measures
and
watched
his
opportunity
the
nuncio
would
not
do
this
without
authority
from
rome
but
the
prudence
courage
and
humility
which
he
discerned
in
the
friar
made
him
believe
that
the
design
was
really
inspired
from
above
to
make
this
certain
and
to
remove
all
scruples
he
submitted
the
matter
to
the
pope
and
asked
his
blessing
upon
it
promising
that
whatever
he
decided
should
be
executed
with
all
discretion
the
same
ideas
pervaded
the
sacred
college
under
gregory
there
are
letters
of
profuse
congratulation
by
the
cardinals
of
lorraine
este
and
pellevé
bourbon
was
an
accomplice
before
the
fact
granvelle
condemned
not
the
act
but
the
delay
delfino
and
santorio
approved
the
cardinal
of
alessandria
had
refused
the
king
gift
at
blois
and
had
opposed
his
wishes
at
the
conclave
circumstances
were
now
so
much
altered
that
the
ring
was
offered
to
him
again
and
this
time
it
was
accepted
the
one
dissentient
from
the
chorus
of
applause
is
said
to
have
been
montalto
his
conduct
when
he
became
pope
makes
it
very
improbable
and
there
is
no
good
authority
for
the
story
but
leti
has
it
who
is
so
far
from
a
panegyrist
that
it
deserves
mention
the
theory
which
was
framed
to
justify
these
practices
has
done
more
than
plots
and
massacres
to
cast
discredit
on
the
catholics
this
theory
was
as
follows
confirmed
heretics
must
be
rigorously
punished
whenever
it
can
be
done
without
the
probability
of
greater
evil
to
religion
where
that
is
feared
the
penalty
may
be
suspended
or
delayed
for
a
season
provided
it
be
inflicted
whenever
the
danger
is
past
treaties
made
with
heretics
and
promises
given
to
them
must
not
be
kept
because
sinful
promises
do
not
bind
and
no
agreement
is
lawful
which
may
injure
religion
or
ecclesiastical
authority
no
civil
power
may
enter
into
engagements
which
impede
the
free
scope
of
the
law
it
is
part
of
the
punishment
of
heretics
that
faith
shall
not
be
kept
with
them
it
is
even
mercy
to
kill
them
that
they
may
sin
no
more
such
were
the
precepts
and
the
examples
by
which
the
french
catholics
learned
to
confound
piety
and
ferocity
and
were
made
ready
to
immolate
their
countrymen
during
the
civil
war
an
association
was
formed
in
the
south
for
the
purpose
of
making
war
upon
the
huguenots
and
it
was
fortified
by
pius
with
blessings
and
indulgences
we
doubt
not
it
proclaimed
that
we
shall
be
victorious
over
these
enemies
of
god
and
of
all
humankind
and
if
we
fall
our
blood
will
be
as
a
second
baptism
by
which
without
impediment
we
shall
join
the
other
martyrs
straightway
in
heaven
monluc
who
told
alva
at
bayonne
that
he
had
never
spared
an
enemy
was
shot
through
the
face
at
the
siege
of
rabasteins
whilst
he
believed
that
he
was
dying
they
came
to
tell
him
that
the
place
was
taken
thank
god
he
said
that
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
behold
our
victory
and
now
i
care
not
for
death
go
back
i
beseech
you
and
give
me
a
last
proof
of
friendship
by
seeing
that
not
one
man
of
the
garrison
escapes
alive
when
alva
had
defeated
and
captured
genlis
and
expected
to
make
many
more
huguenot
prisoners
in
the
garrison
of
mons
charles
ix
wrote
to
mondoucet
that
it
would
be
for
the
service
of
god
and
of
the
king
of
spain
that
they
should
die
if
the
duke
of
alva
answers
that
this
is
a
tacit
request
to
have
all
the
prisoners
cut
to
pieces
you
will
tell
him
that
that
is
what
he
must
do
and
that
he
will
injure
both
himself
and
all
christendom
if
he
fails
to
do
it
this
request
also
reached
alva
through
spain
philip
wrote
on
the
margin
of
the
despatch
that
if
he
had
not
yet
put
them
out
of
the
world
he
must
do
so
immediately
as
there
could
be
no
reason
for
delay
the
same
thought
occurred
to
others
on
the
of
july
salviati
writes
that
it
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
faction
if
alva
would
kill
his
prisoners
and
granvelle
wrote
that
as
they
were
all
huguenots
it
would
be
well
to
throw
them
all
into
the
river
where
these
sentiments
prevailed
gregory
xiii
was
not
alone
in
deploring
that
the
work
had
been
but
half
done
after
the
first
explosion
of
gratified
surprise
men
perceived
that
the
thing
was
a
failure
and
began
to
call
for
more
the
clergy
of
rouen
cathedral
instituted
a
procession
of
thanksgiving
and
prayed
that
the
king
might
continue
what
he
had
so
virtuously
begun
until
all
france
should
profess
one
faith
there
are
signs
that
charles
was
tempted
at
one
moment
during
the
month
of
october
to
follow
up
the
blow
but
he
died
without
pursuing
the
design
and
the
hopes
were
turned
to
his
successor
when
henry
iii
passed
through
italy
on
his
way
to
assume
the
crown
there
were
some
who
hoped
that
the
pope
would
induce
him
to
set
resolutely
about
the
extinction
of
the
huguenots
a
petition
was
addressed
to
gregory
for
this
purpose
in
which
the
writer
says
that
hitherto
the
french
court
has
erred
on
the
side
of
mercy
but
that
the
new
king
might
make
good
the
error
if
rejecting
that
pernicious
maxim
that
noble
blood
spilt
weakens
a
kingdom
he
would
appoint
an
execution
which
would
be
cruel
only
in
appearance
but
in
reality
glorious
and
holy
and
destroy
the
heretics
totally
sparing
neither
life
nor
property
similar
exhortations
were
addressed
from
rome
to
henry
himself
by
muzio
a
layman
who
had
gained
repute
among
other
things
by
controversial
writings
of
which
pius
said
that
they
had
preserved
the
faith
in
whole
districts
and
who
had
been
charged
with
the
task
of
refuting
the
centuriators
on
the
of
july
muzio
wrote
to
the
king
that
all
italy
waited
in
reliance
on
his
justice
and
valour
and
besought
him
to
spare
neither
old
nor
young
and
to
regard
neither
rank
nor
ties
of
blood
these
hopes
also
were
doomed
to
disappointment
and
a
frenchman
writing
in
the
year
of
henry
death
laments
over
the
cruel
clemency
and
inhuman
mercy
that
reigned
on
day
this
was
not
the
general
opinion
of
the
catholic
world
in
spain
and
italy
where
hearts
were
hardened
and
consciences
corrupted
by
the
inquisition
in
switzerland
where
the
catholics
lived
in
suspicion
and
dread
of
their
protestant
neighbours
among
ecclesiastical
princes
in
germany
whose
authority
waned
as
fast
as
their
subjects
abjured
their
faith
the
massacre
was
welcomed
as
an
act
of
christian
fortitude
but
in
france
itself
the
great
mass
of
the
people
was
struck
with
consternation
which
maner
of
proceedings
writes
walsingham
on
the
of
september
is
by
the
catholiques
themselves
utterly
condemned
who
desire
to
depart
hence
out
of
this
country
to
quit
themselves
of
this
strange
kind
of
government
for
that
they
see
here
none
can
assure
themselves
of
either
goods
or
life
even
in
places
still
steeped
in
mourning
for
the
atrocities
suffered
at
the
hands
of
huguenots
during
the
civil
war
at
nîmes
for
instance
the
orders
produced
no
act
of
vengeance
at
carcassonne
the
ancient
seat
of
the
inquisition
the
catholics
concealed
the
protestants
in
their
houses
in
provence
the
news
from
lyons
and
the
corpses
that
came
down
in
the
poisoned
waters
of
the
rhone
awakened
nothing
but
horror
and
compassion
sir
thomas
smith
wrote
to
walsingham
that
in
england
the
minds
of
the
most
number
are
much
alienated
from
that
nation
even
of
the
very
papists
at
rome
itself
zuñiga
pronounced
the
treachery
of
which
the
french
were
boasting
unjustifiable
even
in
the
case
of
heretics
and
rebels
and
it
was
felt
as
an
outrage
to
public
opinion
when
the
murderer
of
coligny
was
presented
to
the
pope
the
emperor
was
filled
with
grief
and
indignation
he
said
that
the
king
and
would
live
to
learn
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
iniquitously
contrived
or
executed
his
uncle
charles
and
his
father
ferdinand
had
made
war
on
the
protestants
but
they
had
never
been
guilty
of
so
cruel
an
act
at
that
moment
maximilian
was
seeking
the
crown
of
poland
for
his
son
and
the
events
in
france
were
a
weapon
in
his
hands
against
his
rival
anjou
even
the
czar
of
muscovy
ivan
the
terrible
replying
to
his
letters
protested
that
all
christian
princes
must
lament
the
barbarous
and
needless
shedding
of
so
much
innocent
blood
it
was
not
the
rivalry
of
the
moment
that
animated
maximilian
his
whole
life
proves
him
to
have
been
an
enemy
of
violence
and
cruelty
and
his
celebrated
letter
to
schwendi
written
long
after
shows
that
his
judgment
remained
unchanged
it
was
the
catholic
emperor
who
roused
the
lutheran
elector
of
saxony
to
something
like
resentment
of
the
butchery
in
france
for
the
lutherans
were
not
disposed
to
recognise
the
victims
of
charles
ix
as
martyrs
for
the
protestant
cause
during
the
wars
of
religion
lutheran
auxiliaries
were
led
by
a
saxon
prince
a
margrave
of
baden
and
other
german
magnates
to
aid
the
catholic
forces
in
putting
down
the
heresy
of
calvin
these
feelings
were
so
well
known
that
the
french
government
demanded
of
the
duke
of
wirtemberg
the
surrender
of
the
huguenots
who
had
fled
into
his
dominions
lutheran
divines
flattered
themselves
at
first
with
the
belief
that
it
was
the
calvinistic
error
not
the
protestant
truth
that
had
invited
and
received
the
blow
the
most
influential
of
them
andreæ
declared
that
the
huguenots
were
not
martyrs
but
rebels
who
had
died
not
for
religion
but
sedition
and
he
bade
the
princes
beware
of
the
contagion
of
their
spirit
which
had
deluged
other
lands
with
blood
when
elizabeth
proposed
a
league
for
the
defence
of
protestantism
the
north
german
divines
protested
against
an
alliance
with
men
whose
crime
was
not
only
religious
error
but
blasphemous
obstinacy
the
root
of
many
dreadful
heresies
the
very
proposal
they
said
argued
a
disposition
to
prefer
human
succour
rather
than
the
word
of
god
when
another
invitation
came
from
henry
of
navarre
the
famous
divine
chemnitz
declared
union
with
the
disciples
of
calvin
a
useless
abomination
the
very
men
whose
own
brethren
had
perished
in
france
were
not
hearty
or
unanimous
in
execrating
the
deed
there
were
huguenots
who
thought
that
their
party
had
brought
ruin
on
itself
by
provoking
its
enemies
and
following
the
rash
counsels
of
ambitious
men
this
was
the
opinion
of
their
chief
theodore
beza
himself
six
weeks
before
he
wrote
that
they
were
gaining
in
numbers
but
losing
in
quality
and
he
feared
lest
after
destroying
superstition
they
should
destroy
religion
valde
metuo
ne
superstitioni
successerit
impietas
and
afterwards
he
declared
that
nobody
who
had
known
the
state
of
the
french
protestants
could
deny
that
it
was
a
most
just
judgment
upon
them
beza
held
very
stringent
doctrines
touching
the
duty
of
the
civil
magistrate
to
repress
religious
error
he
thought
that
heresy
is
worse
than
murder
and
that
the
good
of
society
requires
no
crime
to
be
more
severely
punished
he
declared
toleration
contrary
to
revealed
religion
and
the
constant
tradition
of
the
church
and
taught
that
lawful
authority
must
be
obeyed
even
by
those
whom
it
persecutes
he
expressly
recognised
this
function
in
catholic
states
and
urged
sigismund
not
to
rest
until
he
had
got
rid
of
the
socinians
in
poland
but
he
could
not
prevail
against
the
vehement
resistance
of
cardinal
hosius
it
was
embarrassing
to
limit
these
principles
when
they
were
applied
against
his
own
church
for
a
moment
beza
doubted
whether
it
had
not
received
its
in
france
but
he
did
not
qualify
the
propositions
which
were
open
to
be
interpreted
so
fatally
or
deny
that
his
people
by
their
vices
if
not
by
their
errors
had
deserved
what
they
had
suffered
the
applause
which
greeted
their
fate
came
not
from
the
catholics
generally
nor
from
the
catholics
alone
while
the
protestants
were
ready
to
palliate
or
excuse
it
the
majority
of
the
catholics
who
were
not
under
the
direct
influence
of
madrid
or
rome
recognised
the
inexpiable
horror
of
the
crime
but
the
desire
to
defend
what
the
pope
approved
survived
sporadically
when
the
old
fierceness
of
dogmatic
hatred
was
extinct
a
generation
passed
without
any
perceptible
change
in
the
judgment
of
rome
it
was
a
common
charge
against
de
thou
that
he
had
condemned
the
blameless
act
of
charles
ix
the
blasphemies
of
the
huguenots
said
one
of
his
critics
were
more
abominable
than
their
retribution
his
history
was
put
on
the
index
and
cardinal
barberini
let
him
know
that
he
was
condemned
because
he
not
only
favoured
protestants
to
the
detriment
of
catholics
but
had
even
disapproved
the
massacre
of
st
bartholomew
the
friend
of
bellarmine
pronounces
it
a
pious
and
charitable
act
which
immortalised
its
author
another
jesuit
bompiani
says
that
it
was
grateful
to
gregory
because
it
was
likely
to
relieve
the
church
the
apology
for
charles
ix
by
naudé
is
based
rather
on
political
than
religious
grounds
but
his
contemporary
guyon
whose
history
of
orleans
is
pronounced
by
the
censors
full
of
sound
doctrine
and
pious
sentiment
deems
it
unworthy
of
catholics
to
speak
of
the
murder
of
heretics
as
if
it
were
a
crime
because
when
done
under
lawful
authority
it
is
a
blessed
thing
when
innocent
xi
refused
to
approve
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
frenchmen
wondered
that
he
should
so
far
depart
from
the
example
which
was
kept
before
him
by
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
ornaments
of
his
palace
the
old
spirit
was
decaying
fast
in
france
and
the
superb
indignation
of
bossuet
fairly
expresses
the
general
opinion
of
his
time
two
works
were
published
on
the
medals
of
the

french
and

too
soon

accuses
catherine
of
having
arrested
the
slaughter
in
order

should
remain
to
create
a
demand
for
her
counsels
the
german
jesuit
biner
and
the
papal
historian
piatti
just
a
century
ago
are
among
the
last
downright
apologists
then
there
was
a
change
a
time
came
when
the
catholics
having
long
relied
on
force
were
compelled
to
appeal
to
opinion
that
which
had
been
defiantly
acknowledged
and
defended
required
to
be
ingeniously
explained
away
the
same
motive
which
had
justified
the
murder
now
prompted
the
lie
men
shrank
from
the
conviction
that
the
rulers
and
restorers
of
their
church
had
been
murderers
and
abetters
of
murder
and
that
so
much
infamy
had
been
coupled
with
so
much
zeal
they
feared
to
say
that
the
most
monstrous
of
crimes
had
been
solemnly
approved
at
rome
lest
they
should
devote
the
papacy
to
the
execration
of
mankind
a
swarm
of
facts
were
invented
to
meet
the
difficulty
the
victims
were
insignificant
in
number
they
were
slain
for
no
reason
connected
with
religion
the
pope
believed
in
the
existence
of
the
plot
the
plot
was
a
reality
the
medal
is
fictitious
the
massacre
was
a
feint
concerted
with
the
protestants
themselves
the
pope
rejoiced
only
when
he
heard
that
it
was
over
these
things
were
repeated
so
often
that
they
have
been
sometimes
believed
and
men
have
fallen
into
this
way
of
speaking
whose
sincerity
was
unimpeachable
and
who
were
not
shaken
in
their
religion
by
the
errors
or
the
vices
of
popes
möhler
was
such
a
man
in
his
lectures
on
the
history
of
the
church
which
were
published
only
last
year
he
said
that
the
catholics
as
such
took
no
part
in
the
massacre
that
no
cardinal
bishop
or
priest
shared
in
the
councils
that
prepared
it
that
charles
informed
the
pope
that
a
conspiracy
had
been
discovered
and
that
gregory
made
his
thanksgiving
only
because
the
king
life
was
saved
such
things
will
cease
to
be
written
when
men
perceive
that
truth
is
the
only
merit
that
gives
dignity
and
worth
to
history

v
the
protestant
theory
of
persecution
the
manner
in
which
religion
influences
state
policy
is
more
easily
ascertained
in
the
case
of
protestantism
than
in
that
of
the
catholic
church
for
whilst
the
expression
of
catholic
doctrines
is
authoritative
and
unvarying
the
great
social
problems
did
not
all
arise
at
once
and
have
at
various
times
received
different
solutions
the
reformers
failed
to
construct
a
complete
and
harmonious
code
of
doctrine
but
they
were
compelled
to
supplement
the
new
theology
by
a
body
of
new
rules
for
the
guidance
of
their
followers
in
those
innumerable
questions
with
regard
to
which
the
practice
of
the
church
had
grown
out
of
the
experience
of
ages
and
although
the
dogmatic
system
of
protestantism
was
not
completed
in
their
time
yet
the
protestant
spirit
animated
them
in
greater
purity
and
force
than
it
did
any
later
generation
now
when
a
religion
is
applied
to
the
social
and
political
sphere
its
general
spirit
must
be
considered
rather
than
its
particular
precepts
so
that
in
studying
the
points
of
this
application
in
the
case
of
protestantism
we
may
consult
the
writings
of
the
reformers
with
greater
confidence
than
we
could
do
for
an
exposition
of
protestant
theology
and
accept
them
as
a
greater
authority
because
they
agree
more
entirely
among
themselves
we
can
be
more
sure
that
we
have
the
true
protestant
opinion
in
a
political
or
social
question
on
which
all
the
reformers
are
agreed
than
in
a
theological
question
on
which
they
differ
for
the
concurrent
opinion
must
be
founded
on
an
element
common
to
all
and
therefore
essential
if
it
should
further
appear
that
this
opinion
was
injurious
to
their
actual
interests
and
maintained
at
a
sacrifice
to
themselves
we
should
then
have
an
additional
security
for
its
necessary
connection
with
their
fundamental
views
the
most
important
example
of
this
law
is
the
protestant
theory
of
toleration
the
views
of
the
reformers
on
religious
liberty
are
not
fragmentary
accidental
opinions
unconnected
with
their
doctrines
or
suggested
by
the
circumstances
amidst
which
they
lived
but
the
product
of
their
theological
system
and
of
their
ideas
of
political
and
ecclesiastical
government
civil
and
religious
liberty
are
so
commonly
associated
in
people
mouths
and
are
so
rare
in
fact
that
their
definition
is
evidently
as
little
understood
as
the
principle
of
their
connection
the
point
at
which
they
unite
the
common
root
from
which
they
derive
their
sustenance
is
the
right
of
the
modern
theory
which
has
swept
away
every
authority
except
that
of
the
state
and
has
made
the
sovereign
power
irresistible
by
multiplying
those
who
share
it
is
the
enemy
of
that
common
freedom
in
which
religious
freedom
is
included
it
condemns
as
a
state
within
the
state
every
inner
group
and
community
class
or
corporation
administering
its
own
affairs
and
by
proclaiming
the
abolition
of
privileges
it
emancipates
the
subjects
of
every
such
authority
in
order
to
transfer
them
exclusively
to
its
own
it
recognises
liberty
only
in
the
individual
because
it
is
only
in
the
individual
that
liberty
can
be
separated
from
authority
and
the
right
of
conditional
obedience
deprived
of
the
security
of
a
limited
command
under
its
sway
therefore
every
man
may
profess
his
own
religion
more
or
less
freely
but
his
religion
is
not
free
to
administer
its
own
laws
in
other
words
religious
profession
is
free
but
church
government
is
controlled
and
where
ecclesiastical
authority
is
restricted
religious
liberty
is
virtually
denied
for
religious
liberty
is
not
the
negative
right
of
being
without
any
particular
religion
just
as
is
not
anarchy
it
is
the
right
of
religious
communities
to
the
practice
of
their
own
duties
the
enjoyment
of
their
own
constitution
and
the
protection
of
the
law
which
equally
secures
to
all
the
possession
of
their
own
independence
far
from
implying
a
general
toleration
it
is
best
secured
by
a
limited
one
in
an
indifferent
state
that
is
in
a
state
without
any
definite
religious
character
if
such
a
thing
is
conceivable
no
ecclesiastical
authority
could
exist
a
hierarchical
organisation
would
not
be
tolerated
by
the
sects
that
have
none
or
by
the
enemies
of
all
definite
religion
for
it
would
be
in
contradiction
to
the
prevailing
theory
of
atomic
freedom
nor
can
a
religion
be
free
when
it
is
alone
unless
it
makes
the
state
subject
to
it
for
governments
restrict
the
liberty
of
the
favoured
church
by
way
of
remunerating
themselves
for
their
service
in
preserving
her
unity
the
most
violent
and
prolonged
conflicts
for
religious
freedom
occurred
in
the
middle
ages
between
a
church
which
was
not
threatened
by
rivals
and
states
which
were
most
attentive
to
preserve
her
exclusive
predominance
frederic
the
most
tyrannical
oppressor
of
the
church
among
the
german
emperors
was
the
author
of
those
sanguinary
laws
against
heresy
which
prevailed
so
long
in
many
parts
of
europe
the
inquisition
which
upheld
the
religious
unity
of
the
spanish
nation
imposed
the
severest
restrictions
on
the
spanish
church
and
in
england
conformity
has
been
most
rigorously
exacted
by
those
sovereigns
who
have
most
completely
tyrannised
over
the
established
church
religious
liberty
therefore
is
possible
only
where
the
of
different
religions
is
admitted
with
an
equal
right
to
govern
themselves
according
to
their
own
several
principles
tolerance
of
error
is
requisite
for
freedom
but
freedom
will
be
most
complete
where
there
is
no
actual
diversity
to
be
resisted
and
no
theoretical
unity
to
be
maintained
but
where
unity
exists
as
the
triumph
of
truth
not
of
force
through
the
victory
of
the
church
not
through
the
enactment
of
the
state
this
freedom
is
attainable
only
in
communities
where
rights
are
sacred
and
where
law
is
supreme
if
the
first
duty
is
held
to
be
obedience
to
authority
and
the
preservation
of
order
as
in
the
case
of
aristocracies
and
monarchies
of
the
patriarchal
type
there
is
no
safety
for
the
liberties
either
of
individuals
or
of
religion
where
the
highest
consideration
is
the
public
good
and
the
popular
will
as
in
democracies
and
in
constitutional
monarchies
after
the
french
pattern
majority
takes
the
place
of
authority
an
irresistible
power
is
substituted
for
an
idolatrous
principle
and
all
private
rights
are
equally
insecure
the
true
theory
of
freedom
excludes
all
absolute
power
and
arbitrary
action
and
requires
that
a
tyrannical
or
revolutionary
government
shall
be
coerced
by
the
people
but
it
teaches
that
insurrection
is
criminal
except
as
a
corrective
of
revolution
and
tyranny
in
order
to
understand
the
views
of
the
protestant
reformers
on
toleration
they
must
be
considered
with
reference
to
these
points
while
the
reformation
was
an
act
of
individual
resistance
and
not
a
system
and
when
the
secular
powers
were
engaged
in
supporting
the
authority
of
the
church
the
authors
of
the
movement
were
compelled
to
claim
impunity
for
their
opinions
and
they
held
language
regarding
the
right
of
governments
to
interfere
with
religious
belief
which
resembles
that
of
friends
of
toleration
every
religious
party
however
exclusive
or
servile
its
theory
may
be
if
it
is
in
contradiction
with
a
system
generally
accepted
and
protected
by
law
must
necessarily
at
its
first
appearance
assume
the
protection
of
the
idea
that
the
conscience
is
free
before
a
new
authority
can
be
set
up
in
the
place
of
one
that
exists
there
is
an
interval
when
the
right
of
dissent
must
be
proclaimed
at
the
beginning
of
luther
contest
with
the
holy
see
there
was
no
rival
authority
for
him
to
appeal
to
no
ecclesiastical
organism
existed
the
civil
power
was
not
on
his
side
and
not
even
a
definite
system
had
yet
been
evolved
by
controversy
out
of
his
original
doctrine
of
justification
his
first
efforts
were
acts
of
hostility
his
exhortations
were
entirely
aggressive
and
his
appeal
was
to
the
masses
when
the
prohibition
of
his
new
testament
confirmed
him
in
the
belief
that
no
favour
was
to
be
expected
from
the
princes
he
published
his
book
on
the
civil
power
which
he
judged
superior
to
everything
that
had
been
written
on
government
since
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
in
which
he
asserts
that
authority
is
given
to
the
state
only
against
the
wicked
and
that
it
can
not
coerce
the
godly
princes
he
says
are
not
to
be
obeyed
when
they
command
submission
to
superstitious
errors
but
their
aid
is
not
to
be
invoked
in
support
of
the
word
of
god
heretics
must
be
converted
by
the
scriptures
and
not
by
fire
otherwise
the
hangman
would
be
the
greatest
doctor
at
the
time
when
this
was
written
luther
was
expecting
the
bull
of
excommunication
and
the
ban
of
the
empire
and
for
several
years
it
appeared
doubtful
whether
he
would
escape
the
treatment
he
condemned
he
lived
in
constant
fear
of
assassination
and
his
friends
amused
themselves
with
his
terrors
at
one
time
he
believed
that
a
jew
had
been
hired
by
the
polish
bishops
to
despatch
him
that
an
invisible
physician
was
on
his
way
to
wittenberg
to
murder
him
that
the
pulpit
from
which
he
preached
was
impregnated
with
a
subtle
poison
these
alarms
dictated
his
language
during
those
early
years
it
was
not
the
true
expression
of
his
views
which
he
was
not
yet
strong
enough
openly
to
put
forth
the
zwinglian
schism
the
rise
of
the
anabaptists
and
the
peasants
war
altered
the
aspect
of
affairs
luther
recognised
in
them
the
fruits
of
his
theory
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
of
dissent
and
the
moment
had
arrived
to
secure
his
church
against
the
application
of
the
same
dissolving
principles
which
had
served
him
to
break
off
from
his
allegiance
to
rome
the
excesses
of
the
social
war
threatened
to
deprive
the
movement
of
the
sympathy
of
the
higher
classes
especially
of
the
governments
and
with
the
defeat
of
the
peasants
the
popular
phase
of
the
reformation
came
to
an
end
on
the
continent
the
devil
luther
said
having
failed
to
put
him
down
by
the
help
of
the
pope
was
seeking
his
destruction
through
the
preachers
of
treason
and
blood
he
instantly
turned
from
the
people
to
the
princes
impressed
on
his
party
that
character
of
political
dependence
and
that
habit
of
passive
obedience
to
the
state
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
and
gave
it
a
stability
it
could
never
otherwise
have
acquired
in
thus
taking
refuge
in
the
arms
of
the
civil
power
purchasing
the
safety
of
his
doctrine
by
the
sacrifice
of
its
freedom
and
conferring
on
the
state
together
with
the
right
of
control
the
duty
of
imposing
it
at
the
point
of
the
sword
luther
in
reality
reverted
to
his
original
teaching
the
notion
of
liberty
whether
civil
or
religious
was
hateful
to
his
despotic
nature
and
contrary
to
his
interpretation
of
scripture
as
early
as
he
had
said
that
even
the
turk
was
to
be
reverenced
as
an
authority
the
demoralising
servitude
and
lawless
oppression
which
the
peasants
endured
gave
them
in
his
eyes
no
right
to
relief
and
when
they
rushed
to
arms
invoking
his
name
as
their
deliverer
he
exhorted
the
nobles
to
take
a
merciless
revenge
their
crime
was
that
they
were
animated
by
the
sectarian
spirit
which
it
was
the
most
important
interest
of
luther
to
suppress
the
protestant
authorities
throughout
southern
germany
were
perplexed
by
their
victory
over
the
anabaptists
it
was
not
easy
to
show
that
their
political
tenets
were
revolutionary
and
the
only
subversive
portion
of
their
doctrine
was
that
they
held
with
the
catholics
that
the
state
is
not
responsible
for
religion
they
were
punished
therefore
because
they
taught
that
no
man
ought
to
suffer
for
his
faith
at
nuremberg
the
magistrates
did
not
know
how
to
proceed
against
them
they
seemed
no
worse
than
the
catholics
whom
there
was
no
question
at
that
time
of
exterminating
the
celebrated
osiander
deemed
these
scruples
inconsistent
the
papists
he
said
ought
also
to
be
suppressed
and
so
long
as
this
was
not
done
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
to
extremities
against
the
anabaptists
who
were
no
worse
than
they
luther
also
was
consulted
and
he
decided
that
they
ought
not
to
be
punished
unless
they
refused
to
conform
at
the
command
of
the
government
the
margrave
of
brandenburg
was
also
advised
by
the
divines
that
a
heretic
who
could
not
be
converted
out
of
scripture
might
be
condemned
but
that
in
his
sentence
nothing
should
be
said
about
heresy
but
only
about
sedition
and
murderous
intent
though
he
should
be
guiltless
of
these
with
the
aid
of
this
artifice
great
numbers
were
put
to
death
luther
proud
and
ardent
spirit
despised
such
pretences
he
had
cast
off
all
reserve
and
spoke
his
mind
openly
on
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
state
towards
the
church
and
the
people
his
first
step
was
to
proclaim
it
the
office
of
the
civil
power
to
prevent
abominations
he
provided
no
security
that
in
discharging
this
duty
the
sovereign
should
be
guided
by
the
advice
of
orthodox
divines
but
he
held
the
duty
itself
to
be
imperative
in
obedience
to
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
bible
is
the
sole
guide
in
all
things
he
defined
the
office
and
justified
it
by
scriptural
precedents
the
mosaic
code
he
argued
awarded
to
false
prophets
the
punishment
of
death
and
the
majesty
of
god
is
not
to
be
less
deeply
reverenced
or
less
rigorously
vindicated
under
the
new
testament
than
under
the
old
in
a
more
perfect
revelation
the
obligation
is
stronger
those
who
will
not
hear
the
church
must
be
excluded
from
the
communion
but
the
civil
power
is
to
intervene
when
the
ecclesiastical
excommunication
has
been
pronounced
and
men
must
be
compelled
to
come
in
for
according
to
the
more
accurate
definition
of
the
church
which
is
given
in
the
confession
of
schmalkald
and
in
the
apology
of
the
confession
of
augsburg
excommunication
involves
damnation
there
is
no
salvation
to
be
hoped
for
out
of
the
church
and
the
test
of
orthodoxy
against
the
pope
the
devil
and
all
the
world
is
the
dogma
of
justification
by
faith
the
defence
of
religion
became
on
this
theory
not
only
the
duty
of
the
civil
power
but
the
object
of
its
institution
its
business
was
solely
the
coercion
of
those
who
were
out
of
the
church
the
faithful
could
not
be
the
objects
of
its
action
they
did
of
their
own
accord
more
than
any
laws
required
a
good
tree
says
luther
brings
forth
good
fruit
by
nature
without
compulsion
is
it
not
madness
to
prescribe
laws
to
an
that
it
shall
bear
apples
and
not
thorns
this
view
naturally
proceeded
from
the
axiom
of
the
certainty
of
the
salvation
of
all
who
believe
in
the
confession
of
augsburg
it
is
the
most
important
element
in
luther
political
system
because
while
it
made
all
protestant
governments
despotic
it
led
to
the
rejection
of
the
authority
of
catholic
governments
this
is
the
point
where
protestant
and
catholic
intolerance
meet
if
the
state
were
instituted
to
promote
the
faith
no
obedience
could
be
due
to
a
state
of
a
different
faith
protestants
could
not
conscientiously
be
faithful
subjects
of
catholic
powers
and
they
could
not
therefore
be
tolerated
misbelievers
would
have
no
rights
under
an
orthodox
state
and
a
misbelieving
prince
would
have
no
authority
over
orthodox
subjects
the
more
therefore
luther
expounded
the
guilt
of
resistance
and
the
divine
sanction
of
authority
the
more
subversive
his
influence
became
in
catholic
countries
his
system
was
alike
revolutionary
whether
he
defied
the
catholic
powers
or
promoted
a
protestant
tyranny
he
had
no
notion
of
political
right
he
found
no
authority
for
such
a
claim
in
the
new
testament
and
he
held
that
righteousness
does
not
need
to
exhibit
itself
in
works
it
was
the
same
helpless
dependence
on
the
letter
of
scripture
which
led
the
reformers
to
consequences
more
subversive
of
christian
morality
than
their
views
on
questions
of
polity
when
carlstadt
cited
the
mosaic
law
in
defence
of
polygamy
luther
was
indignant
if
the
mosaic
law
is
to
govern
everything
he
said
we
should
be
compelled
to
adopt
circumcision
nevertheless
as
there
is
no
prohibition
of
polygamy
in
the
new
testament
the
reformers
were
unable
to
condemn
it
they
did
not
forbid
it
as
a
matter
of
divine
law
and
referred
it
entirely
to
the
decision
of
the
civil
legislator
this
accordingly
was
the
view
which
guided
luther
and
melanchthon
in
treating
the
problem
the
ultimate
solution
of
which
was
the
separation
of
england
from
the
church
when
the
landgrave
philip
afterwards
appealed
to
this
opinion
and
to
the
earlier
commentaries
of
luther
the
reformers
were
compelled
to
approve
his
having
two
wives
melanchthon
was
a
witness
at
the
wedding
of
the
second
and
the
only
reservation
was
a
request
that
the
matter
should
not
be
allowed
to
get
abroad
it
was
the
same
portion
of
luther
theology
and
the
same
opposition
to
the
spirit
of
the
church
in
the
treatment
of
scripture
that
induced
him
to
believe
in
astrology
and
to
ridicule
the
copernican
system
his
view
of
the
authority
of
scripture
and
his
theory
of
justification
both
precluded
him
from
appreciating
freedom
christian
freedom
he
said
consists
in
the
belief
that
we
require
no
works
to
attain
piety
and
salvation
thus
he
became
the
inventor
of
the
theory
of
passive
obedience
according
to
which
no
motives
or
provocation
can
justify
a
revolt
and
the
party
against
whom
the
revolt
is
directed
whatever
its
guilt
may
be
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
party
revolting
however
just
its
cause
in
he
therefore
declared
that
the
german
princes
had
no
right
to
resist
the
emperor
in
defence
of
their
religion
it
was
the
duty
of
a
christian
he
said
to
suffer
wrong
and
no
breach
of
oath
or
of
duty
could
deprive
the
emperor
of
his
right
to
the
unconditional
obedience
of
his
subjects
even
the
empire
seemed
to
him
a
despotism
from
his
scriptural
belief
that
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
last
of
the
four
monarchies
he
preferred
submission
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
future
protestant
emperor
to
a
resistance
which
might
have
dismembered
the
empire
if
it
had
succeeded
and
in
which
failure
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
protestants
and
he
was
always
afraid
to
draw
the
logical
consequences
of
his
theory
of
the
duty
of
protestants
towards
catholic
sovereigns
in
consequence
of
this
fact
ranke
affirms
that
the
great
reformer
was
also
one
of
the
greatest
conservatives
that
ever
lived
and
his
biographer
jürgens
makes
the
more
discriminating
remark
that
history
knows
of
no
man
who
was
at
once
so
great
an
insurgent
and
so
great
an
upholder
of
order
as
he
neither
of
these
writers
understood
that
the
same
principle
lies
at
the
root
both
of
revolution
and
of
passive
obedience
and
that
the
difference
is
only
in
the
temper
of
the
person
who
applies
it
and
in
the
outward
circumstances
luther
theory
is
apparently
in
opposition
to
protestant
interests
for
it
entitles
catholicism
to
the
protection
of
catholic
powers
he
disguised
from
himself
this
inconsistency
and
reconciled
theory
with
expediency
by
the
calculation
that
the
immense
advantages
which
his
system
offered
to
the
princes
would
induce
them
all
to
adopt
it
for
besides
the
consolatory
doctrine
of
justification
a
doctrine
original
specious
persuasive
powerful
against
rome
and
wonderfully
adapted
as
if
prophetically
to
the
genius
of
the
times
which
were
to
follow
he
bribed
the
princes
with
the
wealth
of
the
church
independence
of
ecclesiastical
authority
facilities
for
polygamy
and
absolute
power
he
told
the
peasants
not
to
take
arms
against
the
church
unless
they
could
persuade
the
government
to
give
the
order
but
thinking
it
probable
in
that
the
catholic
clergy
would
in
spite
of
his
advice
be
exterminated
by
the
fury
of
the
people
he
urged
the
government
to
suppress
them
because
what
was
done
by
the
constituted
authority
could
not
be
wrong
persuaded
that
the
sovereign
power
would
be
on
his
side
he
allowed
no
limits
to
its
extent
it
is
absurd
he
says
to
imagine
that
even
with
the
best
intentions
kings
can
avoid
committing
occasional
injustice
they
stand
therefore
particularly
in
need
not
of
safeguards
against
the
abuse
of
power
but
of
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
power
thus
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
rulers
for
the
guardianship
of
the
faith
he
wished
to
be
used
with
the
utmost
severity
against
unregenerate
men
in
whom
there
was
neither
moral
virtue
nor
civil
rights
and
from
whom
no
good
could
come
until
they
were
converted
he
therefore
required
that
all
crimes
should
be
most
cruelly
punished
and
that
the
secular
arm
should
be
employed
to
convert
where
it
did
not
destroy
the
idea
of
mercy
tempering
justice
he
denounced
as
a
popish
superstition
the
chief
object
of
the
severity
thus
recommended
was
of
course
efficaciously
to
promote
the
end
for
which
government
itself
was
held
to
be
instituted
the
clergy
had
authority
over
the
conscience
but
it
was
thought
necessary
that
they
should
be
supported
by
the
state
with
the
absolute
penalties
of
outlawry
in
order
that
error
might
be
exterminated
although
it
was
impossible
to
banish
sin
no
government
it
was
maintained
could
tolerate
heresy
without
being
responsible
for
the
souls
that
were
seduced
by
it
and
as
ezechiel
destroyed
the
brazen
serpent
to
prevent
idolatry
the
mass
must
be
suppressed
for
the
mass
was
the
worst
kind
of
idolatry
in
when
it
was
proposed
to
leave
the
matters
in
dispute
to
the
decision
of
the
future
council
luther
declared
that
the
mass
and
monastic
life
could
not
be
tolerated
in
the
meantime
because
it
was
unlawful
to
connive
at
error
it
will
lie
heavy
on
your
conscience
he
writes
to
the
duke
of
saxony
if
you
tolerate
the
catholic
worship
for
no
secular
prince
can
permit
his
subjects
to
be
divided
by
the
preaching
of
opposite
doctrines
the
catholics
have
no
right
to
complain
for
they
do
not
prove
the
truth
of
their
doctrine
from
scripture
and
therefore
do
not
conscientiously
believe
it
he
would
tolerate
them
only
if
they
acknowledged
themselves
like
the
jews
enemies
of
christ
and
of
the
emperor
and
consented
to
exist
as
outcasts
of
society
heretics
he
said
are
not
to
be
disputed
with
but
to
be
condemned
unheard
and
whilst
they
perish
by
fire
the
faithful
ought
to
pursue
the
evil
to
its
source
and
bathe
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
catholic
bishops
and
of
the
pope
who
is
a
devil
in
disguise
the
persecuting
principles
which
were
involved
in
luther
system
but
which
he
cared
neither
to
develop
to
apply
nor
to
defend
were
formed
into
a
definite
theory
by
the
colder
genius
of
melanchthon
destitute
of
luther
confidence
in
his
own
strength
and
in
the
infallible
success
of
his
doctrine
he
clung
more
eagerly
to
the
hope
of
achieving
victory
by
the
use
of
physical
force
like
his
master
he
too
hesitated
at
first
and
opposed
the
use
of
severe
measures
against
the
zwickau
prophets
but
when
he
saw
the
development
of
that
early
germ
of
dissent
and
the
gradual
dissolution
of
lutheran
unity
he
repented
of
his
clemency
he
was
not
deterred
from
asserting
the
duty
of
persecution
by
the
risk
of
putting
arms
into
the
hands
of
the
enemies
of
the
reformation
he
acknowledged
the
danger
but
he
denied
the
right
catholic
powers
he
deemed
might
justly
persecute
but
they
could
only
persecute
error
they
must
apply
the
same
criterion
which
the
lutherans
applied
and
then
they
were
justified
in
persecuting
those
whom
the
lutherans
also
proscribed
for
the
civil
power
had
no
right
to
proscribe
a
religion
in
order
to
save
itself
from
the
dangers
of
a
distracted
and
divided
population
the
judge
of
the
fact
and
of
the
danger
must
be
not
the
magistrate
but
the
clergy
the
crime
lay
not
in
dissent
but
in
error
here
therefore
melanchthon
repudiated
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
catholics
whose
aid
he
invoked
for
all
the
intolerance
in
the
catholic
times
was
founded
on
the
combination
of
two
ideas
the
criminality
of
apostasy
and
the
inability
of
the
state
to
maintain
its
authority
where
the
moral
sense
of
a
part
of
the
community
was
in
opposition
to
it
the
reformers
therefore
approved
the
catholic
practice
of
intolerance
and
even
encouraged
it
although
their
own
principles
of
persecution
were
destitute
not
only
of
connection
but
even
of
analogy
with
it
by
simply
accepting
the
inheritance
of
the
mediæval
theory
of
the
religious
unity
of
the
empire
they
would
have
been
its
victims
by
asserting
that
persecution
was
justifiable
only
against
error
that
is
only
when
purely
religious
they
set
up
a
shield
for
themselves
and
a
sword
against
those
sects
for
whose
destruction
they
were
more
eager
than
the
catholics
whether
we
refer
the
origin
of
protestant
intolerance
to
the
doctrines
or
to
the
interests
of
the
reformation
it
appears
totally
unconnected
with
the
tradition
of
catholic
ages
or
the
atmosphere
of
catholicism
all
severities
exercised
by
catholics
before
that
time
had
a
practical
motive
but
protestant
persecution
was
based
on
a
purely
speculative
foundation
and
was
due
partly
to
the
influence
of
scripture
examples
partly
to
the
supposed
interests
of
the
protestant
party
it
never
admitted
the
exclusion
of
dissent
to
be
a
political
right
of
the
state
but
maintained
the
suppression
of
error
to
be
its
political
duty
to
say
therefore
that
the
protestants
learnt
persecution
from
the
catholics
is
as
false
as
to
say
that
they
used
it
by
way
of
revenge
for
they
founded
it
on
very
different
and
contradictory
grounds
and
they
admitted
the
right
of
the
catholics
to
persecute
even
the
protestant
sects
melanchthon
taught
that
the
sects
ought
to
be
put
down
by
the
sword
and
that
any
individual
who
started
new
opinions
ought
to
be
punished
with
death
he
carefully
laid
down
that
these
severities
were
requisite
not
in
consideration
of
the
danger
to
the
state
nor
of
immoral
teaching
nor
even
of
such
differences
as
would
weaken
the
authority
or
arrest
the
action
of
the
ecclesiastical
organisation
but
simply
on
account
of
a
difference
however
slight
in
the
theologumena
of
protestantism
thamer
who
held
the
possibility
of
salvation
among
the
heathen
schwenkfeld
who
taught
that
not
the
written
word
but
the
internal
illumination
of
grace
in
the
soul
was
the
channel
of
influence
on
man
the
zwinglians
with
their
error
on
the
eucharist
all
these
met
with
no
more
favour
than
the
fanatical
anabaptists
the
state
was
held
bound
to
vindicate
the
first
table
of
the
law
with
the
same
severity
as
those
commandments
on
which
civil
society
depends
for
its
existence
the
government
of
the
church
being
administered
by
the
civil
magistrates
it
was
their
office
also
to
enforce
the
ordinances
of
religion
and
the
same
power
whose
voice
proclaimed
religious
orthodoxy
and
law
held
in
its
hand
the
sword
by
which
they
were
enforced
no
religious
authority
existed
except
through
the
civil
power
the
church
was
merged
in
the
state
but
the
laws
of
the
state
in
return
were
identified
with
the
commandments
of
religion
in
accordance
with
these
principles
the
condemnation
of
servetus
by
a
civil
tribunal
which
had
no
authority
over
him
and
no
jurisdiction
over
his
crime
the
most
aggressive
and
revolutionary
act
therefore
that
is
conceivable
in
the
casuistry
of
persecution
was
highly
approved
by
melanchthon
he
declared
it
a
most
useful
example
for
all
future
ages
and
could
not
understand
that
there
should
be
any
who
did
not
regard
it
in
the
same
favourable
light
it
is
true
that
servetus
by
denying
the
divinity
of
christ
was
open
to
the
charge
of
blasphemy
in
a
stricter
sense
than
that
in
which
the
reformers
generally
applied
it
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
the
catholics
they
did
not
represent
like
the
sects
an
element
of
dissolution
in
protestantism
and
the
bulk
of
their
doctrine
was
admitted
by
the
reformers
they
were
not
in
revolt
against
existing
authority
they
required
no
special
innovations
for
their
protection
they
demanded
only
that
the
change
of
religion
should
not
be
compulsory
yet
melanchthon
held
that
they
too
were
to
be
proscribed
because
their
worship
was
idolatrous
in
doing
this
he
adopted
the
principle
of
aggressive
intolerance
which
was
at
that
time
new
to
the
christian
world
and
which
the
popes
and
councils
of
the
catholic
church
had
condemned
when
the
zeal
of
laymen
had
gone
beyond
the
lawful
measure
in
the
middle
ages
there
had
been
persecution
far
more
sanguinary
than
any
that
has
been
inflicted
by
protestants
various
motives
had
occasioned
it
and
various
arguments
had
been
used
in
its
defence
but
the
principle
on
which
the
protestants
oppressed
the
catholics
was
new
the
catholics
had
never
admitted
the
theory
of
absolute
toleration
as
it
was
defined
at
first
by
luther
and
afterwards
by
some
of
the
sects
in
principle
their
tolerance
differed
from
that
of
the
protestants
as
widely
as
their
intolerance
they
had
exterminated
sects
which
like
the
albigenses
threatened
to
overturn
the
fabric
of
christian
society
they
had
proscribed
different
religions
where
the
state
was
founded
on
religious
unity
and
where
this
unity
formed
an
integral
part
of
its
laws
and
administration
they
had
gone
one
step
further
and
punished
those
whom
the
church
condemned
as
apostates
thereby
vindicating
not
as
in
the
first
case
the
moral
basis
of
society
nor
as
in
the
second
the
religious
foundation
of
the
state
but
the
authority
of
the
church
and
the
purity
of
her
doctrine
on
which
they
relied
as
the
pillar
and
bulwark
of
the
social
and
political
order
where
a
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
country
preferred
a
different
creed
jew
mohammedan
heathen
or
schismatic
they
had
been
generally
tolerated
with
enjoyment
of
property
and
personal
freedom
but
not
with
that
of
political
power
or
autonomy
but
political
freedom
had
been
denied
them
because
they
did
not
admit
the
common
ideas
of
duty
which
were
its
basis
this
position
however
was
not
tenable
and
was
the
source
of
great
disorders
the
protestants
in
like
manner
could
give
reasons
for
several
kinds
of
persecution
they
could
bring
the
socinians
under
the
category
of
blasphemers
and
blasphemy
like
the
ridicule
of
sacred
things
destroys
reverence
and
awe
and
tends
to
the
destruction
of
society
the
anabaptists
they
might
argue
were
revolutionary
fanatics
whose
doctrines
were
subversive
of
the
civil
order
and
the
dogmatic
sects
threatened
the
ruin
of
ecclesiastical
unity
within
the
protestant
community
itself
but
by
placing
the
necessity
of
intolerance
on
the
simple
ground
of
religious
error
and
in
directing
it
against
the
church
which
they
themselves
had
abandoned
they
introduced
a
purely
subjective
test
and
a
purely
revolutionary
system
it
is
on
this
account
that
the
or
retaliatory
argument
is
inadmissible
between
catholics
and
protestants
catholic
intolerance
is
handed
down
from
an
age
when
unity
subsisted
and
when
its
preservation
being
essential
for
that
of
society
became
a
necessity
of
state
as
well
as
a
result
of
circumstances
protestant
intolerance
on
the
contrary
was
the
peculiar
fruit
of
a
dogmatic
system
in
contradiction
with
the
facts
and
principles
on
which
the
intolerance
actually
existing
among
catholics
was
founded
spanish
intolerance
has
been
infinitely
more
sanguinary
than
swedish
but
in
spain
independently
of
the
interests
of
religion
there
were
strong
political
and
social
reasons
to
justify
persecution
without
seeking
any
theory
to
prop
it
up
whilst
in
sweden
all
those
practical
considerations
have
either
been
wanting
or
have
been
opposed
to
persecution
which
has
consequently
had
no
justification
except
the
theory
of
the
reformation
the
only
instance
in
which
the
protestant
theory
has
been
adopted
by
catholics
is
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
towards
the
end
of
his
life
melanchthon
having
ceased
to
be
a
strict
lutheran
receded
somewhat
from
his
former
uncompromising
position
and
was
adverse
to
a
strict
scrutiny
into
minor
theological
differences
he
drew
a
distinction
between
errors
that
required
punishment
and
variations
that
were
not
of
practical
importance
the
english
calvinists
who
took
refuge
in
germany
in
the
reign
of
mary
tudor
were
ungraciously
received
by
those
who
were
stricter
lutherans
than
melanchthon
he
was
consulted
concerning
the
course
to
be
adopted
towards
the
refugees
and
he
recommended
toleration
but
both
at
wesel
and
at
frankfort
his
advice
was
to
his
great
disgust
overruled
the
severities
of
the
protestants
were
chiefly
provoked
by
the
anabaptists
who
denied
the
lawfulness
of
civil
government
and
strove
to
realise
the
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
by
absorbing
the
state
in
the
church
none
protested
more
loudly
than
they
against
the
lutheran
intolerance
or
suffered
from
it
more
severely
but
while
denying
the
spiritual
authority
of
the
state
they
claimed
for
their
religious
community
a
still
more
absolute
right
of
punishing
error
by
death
though
they
sacrificed
government
to
religion
the
effect
was
the
same
as
that
of
absorbing
the
church
in
the
state
in
münzer
published
a
sermon
in
which
he
besought
the
lutheran
princes
to
extirpate
catholicism
have
no
remorse
he
says
for
he
to
whom
all
power
is
given
in
heaven
and
on
earth
means
to
govern
alone
he
demanded
the
punishment
of
all
heretics
the
destruction
of
all
who
were
not
of
his
faith
and
the
institution
of
religious
unity
do
not
pretend
he
says
that
the
power
of
god
will
accomplish
it
without
the
use
of
your
sword
or
it
will
grow
rusty
in
the
scabbard
the
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
must
be
cut
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
elsewhere
the
ungodly
have
no
right
to
live
except
so
far
as
the
elect
choose
to
grant
it
them
when
the
anabaptists
were
supreme
at
münster
they
exhibited
the
same
intolerance
at
seven
in
the
morning
of
friday
february
they
ran
through
the
streets
crying
away
with
the
ungodly
breaking
into
the
houses
of
those
who
refused
their
baptism
they
drove
the
men
out
of
the
town
and
forcibly
rebaptized
the
women
who
remained
behind
whilst
therefore
the
anabaptists
were
punished
for
questioning
the
authority
of
the
lutherans
in
religious
matters
they
practically
justified
their
persecution
by
their
own
intolerant
doctrines
in
fact
they
carried
the
protestant
principles
of
persecution
to
an
extreme
for
whereas
the
lutherans
regarded
the
defence
of
truth
and
punishment
of
error
as
being
in
part
the
object
of
the
institution
of
civil
government
they
recognised
it
as
an
advantage
by
which
the
state
was
rewarded
for
its
pains
but
the
anabaptists
repudiated
the
political
element
altogether
and
held
that
error
should
be
exterminated
solely
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
at
the
expense
of
all
existing
states
bucer
whose
position
in
the
history
of
the
reformation
is
so
peculiar
and
who
differed
in
important
points
from
the
saxon
leaders
agreed
with
them
on
the
necessity
of
persecuting
he
was
so
anxious
for
the
success
of
protestantism
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
and
renounce
important
doctrines
in
order
to
save
the
appearance
of
unity
but
those
opinions
in
which
he
took
so
little
dogmatic
interest
he
was
resolved
to
defend
by
force
he
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
reluctance
of
the
senate
of
strasburg
to
adopt
severe
measures
against
the
catholics
his
colleague
capito
was
singularly
tolerant
for
the
feeling
of
the
inhabitants
was
not
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
change
but
bucer
his
biographer
tells
us
was
in
spite
of
his
inclination
to
mediate
not
friendly
to
this
temporising
system
partly
because
he
had
an
organising
intellect
which
relied
greatly
on
practical
discipline
to
preserve
what
had
been
conquered
and
on
restriction
of
liberty
to
be
the
most
certain
security
for
its
preservation
partly
because
he
had
a
deep
insight
into
the
nature
of
various
religious
tendencies
and
was
justly
alarmed
at
their
consequences
for
church
and
state
this
point
in
the
character
of
bucer
provoked
a
powerful
resistance
to
his
system
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
for
it
was
feared
that
he
would
give
to
the
clergy
a
tyrannical
power
it
is
true
that
the
demoralisation
which
ensued
on
the
destruction
of
the
old
ecclesiastical
authority
rendered
a
strict
attention
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
the
affairs
of
religion
highly
necessary
the
private
and
confidential
communications
of
the
german
reformers
give
a
more
hideous
picture
of
the
moral
condition
of
the
generation
which
followed
the
reformation
than
they
draw
in
their
published
writings
of
that
which
preceded
it
it
is
on
this
account
that
bucer
so
strongly
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
the
interference
of
the
civil
power
in
support
of
the
discipline
of
the
church
the
swiss
reformers
between
whom
and
the
saxons
bucer
forms
a
connecting
link
differ
from
them
in
one
respect
which
greatly
influenced
their
notions
of
government
luther
lived
under
a
monarchy
which
was
almost
absolute
and
in
which
the
common
people
who
were
of
slavonic
origin
were
in
the
position
of
the
most
abject
servitude
but
the
divines
of
zürich
and
bern
were
republicans
they
did
not
therefore
entertain
his
exalted
views
as
to
the
irresistible
might
of
the
state
and
instead
of
requiring
as
absolute
a
theory
of
the
indefectibility
of
the
civil
power
as
he
did
they
were
satisfied
with
obtaining
a
preponderating
influence
for
themselves
where
the
power
was
in
hands
less
favourable
to
their
cause
they
had
less
inducement
to
exaggerate
its
rights
zwingli
abolishes
both
the
distinction
between
church
and
state
and
the
notion
of
ecclesiastical
authority
in
his
system
the
civil
rulers
possess
the
spiritual
functions
and
as
their
foremost
duty
is
the
preservation
and
promotion
of
the
true
religion
it
is
their
business
to
preach
as
magistrates
are
too
much
occupied
with
other
things
they
must
delegate
the
ministry
of
the
word
to
preachers
for
whose
orthodoxy
they
have
to
provide
they
are
bound
to
establish
uniformity
of
doctrine
and
to
defend
it
against
papists
and
heretics
this
is
not
only
their
right
but
their
duty
and
not
only
their
duty
but
the
condition
on
which
they
retain
office
rulers
who
do
not
act
in
accordance
with
it
are
to
be
dismissed
thus
zwingli
combined
persecution
and
revolution
in
the
same
doctrine
but
he
was
not
a
fanatical
persecutor
and
his
severity
was
directed
less
against
the
catholics
than
against
the
anabaptists
whose
prohibition
of
all
civil
offices
was
more
subversive
of
order
in
a
republic
than
in
a
monarchy
even
however
in
the
case
of
the
anabaptists
the
special
provocation
was
not
the
peril
to
the
state
nor
the
scandal
of
their
errors
but
the
schism
which
weakened
the
church
the
punishment
of
heresy
for
the
glory
of
god
was
almost
inconsistent
with
the
theory
that
there
is
no
ecclesiastical
power
it
was
not
so
much
provoked
in
zürich
as
elsewhere
because
in
a
small
republican
community
where
the
governing
body
was
supreme
over
both
civil
and
religious
affairs
religious
unity
was
a
matter
of
course
the
practical
necessity
of
maintaining
unity
put
out
of
sight
the
speculative
question
of
the
guilt
and
penalty
of
error
soon
after
zwingli
death
leo
judæ
called
for
severer
measures
against
the
catholics
expressly
stating
however
that
they
did
not
deserve
death
excommunication
he
said
was
too
light
a
punishment
to
be
inflicted
by
the
state
which
wields
the
sword
and
the
faults
in
question
were
not
great
enough
to
involve
the
danger
of
death
afterwards
he
fell
into
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
severe
measures
against
dissenters
but
his
friends
bullinger
and
capito
succeeded
in
removing
his
scruples
and
in
obtaining
his
acquiescence
in
that
intolerance
which
was
says
his
biographer
a
question
of
life
and
death
for
the
protestant
church
bullinger
took
like
zwingli
a
more
practical
view
of
the
question
than
was
common
in
germany
he
thought
it
safer
strictly
to
exclude
religious
differences
than
to
put
them
down
with
fire
and
sword
for
in
this
case
he
says
the
victims
compare
themselves
to
the
early
martyrs
and
make
their
punishment
a
weapon
of
defence
he
did
not
however
forbid
capital
punishment
in
cases
of
heresy
in
the
year
he
drew
up
an
opinion
on
the
treatment
of
religious
error
which
is
written
in
a
tone
of
great
moderation
in
this
document
he
says
that
all
sects
which
introduce
division
into
the
church
must
be
put
down
and
not
only
such
as
like
the
anabaptists
threaten
to
subvert
society
for
the
destruction
of
order
and
unity
often
begins
in
an
apparently
harmless
or
imperceptible
way
the
culprit
should
be
examined
with
gentleness
if
his
disposition
is
good
he
will
not
refuse
instruction
if
not
still
patience
must
be
shown
until
there
is
no
hope
of
converting
him
then
he
must
be
treated
like
other
malefactors
and
handed
over
to
the
torturer
and
the
executioner
after
this
time
there
were
no
executions
for
religion
in
zürich
and
the
number
even
in
the
lifetime
of
zwingli
was
less
considerable
than
in
many
other
places
but
it
was
still
understood
that
confirmed
heretics
would
be
put
to
death
in
in
answer
to
the
pope
invitation
to
the
council
of
trent
bullinger
indignantly
repudiates
the
insinuation
that
the
protestant
cantons
were
heretical
for
by
the
grace
of
god
we
have
always
punished
the
vices
of
heresy
and
sodomy
with
fire
and
have
looked
upon
them
and
still
look
upon
them
with
horror
this
accusation
of
heresy
inflamed
the
zeal
of
the
reformers
against
heretics
in
order
to
prove
to
the
catholics
that
they
had
no
sympathy
with
them
on
these
grounds
bullinger
recommended
the
execution
of
servetus
if
the
high
council
inflicts
on
him
the
fate
due
to
a
worthless
blasphemer
all
the
world
will
see
that
the
people
of
geneva
hate
blasphemers
and
that
they
punish
with
the
sword
of
justice
heretics
who
are
obstinate
in
their
heresy
strict
fidelity
and
vigilance
are
needed
because
our
churches
are
in
ill
repute
abroad
as
if
we
were
heretics
and
friends
of
heresy
now
god
holy
providence
has
furnished
an
opportunity
of
clearing
ourselves
of
this
evil
suspicion
after
the
event
he
advised
calvin
to
justify
it
as
there
were
some
who
were
taken
aback
everywhere
he
says
there
are
excellent
men
who
are
convinced
that
godless
and
blaspheming
men
ought
not
only
to
be
rebuked
and
imprisoned
but
also
to
be
put
to
death
how
servetus
could
have
been
spared
i
can
not
see
the
position
of
oecolampadius
in
reference
to
these
questions
was
altogether
singular
and
exceptional
he
dreaded
the
absorption
of
the
ecclesiastical
functions
by
the
state
and
sought
to
avoid
it
by
the
introduction
of
a
council
of
twelve
elders
partly
magistrates
partly
clergy
to
direct
ecclesiastical
affairs
many
things
he
said
are
punished
by
the
secular
power
less
severely
than
the
dignity
of
the
church
demands
on
the
other
hand
it
punishes
the
repentant
to
whom
the
church
shows
mercy
either
it
blunts
the
edge
of
its
sword
by
not
punishing
the
guilty
or
it
brings
some
hatred
on
the
gospel
by
severity
but
the
people
of
basel
were
deaf
to
the
arguments
of
the
reformer
and
here
as
elsewhere
the
civil
power
usurped
the
office
of
the
church
in
harmony
with
this
jealousy
of
political
interference
oecolampadius
was
very
merciful
to
the
anabaptists
severe
penalties
he
said
were
likely
to
aggravate
the
evil
forgiveness
would
hasten
the
cure
a
few
months
later
however
he
regretted
this
leniency
we
perceive
he
writes
to
a
friend
that
we
have
sometimes
shown
too
much
indulgence
but
this
is
better
than
to
proceed
tyrannically
or
to
surrender
the
keys
of
the
church
whilst
on
the
other
hand
he
rejoiced
at
the
expulsion
of
the
catholics
he
ingeniously
justified
the
practice
of
the
catholic
persecutors
in
the
early
ages
of
the
church
when
the
divinity
of
christ
manifested
itself
to
the
world
by
miracles
god
incited
the
apostles
to
treat
the
ungodly
with
severity
when
the
miracles
ceased
and
the
faith
was
universally
adopted
he
gained
the
hearts
of
princes
and
rulers
so
that
they
undertook
to
protect
with
the
sword
the
gentleness
and
patience
of
the
church
they
rigorously
resisted
in
fulfilment
of
the
duties
of
their
office
the
contemners
of
the
church
the
clergy
he
goes
on
to
say
became
tyrannical
because
they
usurped
to
themselves
a
power
which
they
ought
to
have
shared
with
others
and
as
the
people
dread
the
return
of
this
tyranny
of
ecclesiastical
authority
it
is
wiser
for
the
protestant
clergy
to
make
no
use
of
the
similar
power
of
excommunication
which
is
intrusted
to
them
calvin
as
the
subject
of
an
absolute
monarch
and
the
ruling
spirit
in
a
republic
differed
both
from
the
german
and
the
swiss
reformers
in
his
idea
of
the
state
both
in
its
object
and
in
its
duty
towards
the
church
an
exile
from
his
own
country
he
had
lost
the
associations
and
habits
of
monarchy
and
his
views
of
discipline
as
well
as
doctrine
were
matured
before
he
took
up
his
abode
in
switzerland
his
system
was
not
founded
on
existing
facts
it
had
no
roots
in
history
but
was
purely
ideal
speculative
and
therefore
more
consistent
and
inflexible
than
any
other
luther
political
ideas
were
bounded
by
the
horizon
of
the
monarchical
absolutism
under
which
he
lived
zwingli
were
influenced
by
the
democratic
forms
of
his
native
country
which
gave
to
the
whole
community
the
right
of
appointing
the
governing
body
calvin
independent
of
all
such
considerations
studied
only
how
his
doctrine
could
best
be
realised
whether
through
the
instrumentality
of
existing
authorities
or
at
their
expense
in
his
eyes
its
interests
were
paramount
their
promotion
the
supreme
duty
opposition
to
them
an
unpardonable
crime
there
was
nothing
in
the
institutions
of
men
no
authority
no
right
no
liberty
that
he
cared
to
preserve
or
towards
which
he
entertained
any
feelings
of
reverence
or
obligation
his
theory
made
the
support
of
religious
truth
the
end
and
office
of
the
state
which
was
bound
therefore
to
protect
and
consequently
to
obey
the
church
and
had
no
control
over
it
in
religion
the
first
and
highest
thing
was
the
dogma
the
preservation
of
morals
was
one
important
office
of
government
but
the
maintenance
of
the
purity
of
doctrine
was
the
highest
the
result
of
this
theory
is
the
institution
of
a
pure
theocracy
if
the
elect
were
alone
upon
the
earth
calvin
taught
there
would
be
no
need
of
the
political
order
and
the
anabaptists
would
be
right
in
rejecting
it
but
the
elect
are
in
a
minority
and
there
is
the
mass
of
reprobates
who
must
be
coerced
by
the
sword
in
order
that
all
the
world
may
be
made
subject
to
the
truth
by
the
conquerors
imposing
their
faith
upon
the
vanquished
he
wished
to
extend
religion
by
the
sword
but
to
reserve
death
as
the
punishment
of
apostasy
and
as
this
law
would
include
the
catholics
who
were
in
calvin
eyes
apostates
from
the
truth
he
narrowed
it
further
to
those
who
were
apostates
from
the
community
in
this
way
he
said
there
was
no
pretext
given
to
the
catholics
to
retaliate
they
as
well
as
the
jews
and
mohammedans
must
be
allowed
to
live
death
was
only
the
penalty
of
protestants
who
relapsed
into
error
but
to
them
it
applied
equally
whether
they
were
converted
to
the
church
or
joined
the
sects
and
fell
into
unbelief
only
in
cases
where
there
was
no
danger
of
his
words
being
used
against
the
protestants
and
in
letters
not
intended
for
publication
he
required
that
catholics
should
suffer
the
same
penalties
as
those
who
were
guilty
of
sedition
on
the
ground
that
the
majesty
of
god
must
be
as
strictly
avenged
as
the
throne
of
the
king
if
the
defence
of
the
truth
was
the
purpose
for
which
power
was
intrusted
to
princes
it
was
natural
that
it
should
be
also
the
condition
on
which
they
held
it
long
before
the
revolution
of
calvin
had
decided
that
princes
who
deny
the
true
faith
abdicate
their
crowns
and
are
no
longer
to
be
obeyed
and
that
no
oaths
are
binding
which
are
in
contradiction
to
the
interests
of
protestantism
he
painted
the
princes
of
his
age
in
the
blackest
colours
and
prayed
to
god
for
their
destruction
though
at
the
same
time
he
condemned
all
rebellion
on
the
part
of
his
friends
so
long
as
there
were
great
doubts
of
their
success
his
principles
however
were
often
stronger
than
his
exhortations
and
he
had
difficulty
in
preventing
murders
and
seditious
movements
in
france
when
he
was
dead
nobody
prevented
them
and
it
became
clear
that
his
system
by
subjecting
the
civil
power
to
the
service
of
religion
was
more
dangerous
to
toleration
than
plan
of
giving
to
the
state
supremacy
over
the
church
calvin
was
as
positive
as
luther
in
asserting
the
duty
of
obedience
to
rulers
irrespective
of
their
mode
of
government
he
constantly
declared
that
tyranny
was
not
to
be
resisted
on
political
grounds
that
no
civil
rights
could
outweigh
the
divine
sanction
of
government
except
in
cases
where
a
special
office
was
appointed
for
the
purpose
where
there
was
no
such
office
where
for
instance
the
estates
of
the
realm
had
lost
their
independence
there
was
no
protection
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
essential
characteristics
of
the
politics
of
the
reformers
by
making
the
protection
of
their
religion
the
principal
business
of
government
they
put
out
of
sight
its
more
immediate
and
universal
duties
and
made
the
political
objects
of
the
state
disappear
behind
its
religious
end
a
government
was
to
be
judged
in
their
eyes
only
by
its
fidelity
to
the
protestant
church
if
it
fulfilled
those
requirements
no
other
complaints
against
it
could
be
entertained
a
tyrannical
prince
could
not
be
resisted
if
he
was
orthodox
a
just
prince
could
be
dethroned
if
he
failed
in
the
more
essential
condition
of
faith
in
this
way
protestantism
became
favourable
at
once
to
despotism
and
to
revolution
and
was
ever
ready
to
sacrifice
good
government
to
its
own
interests
it
subverted
monarchies
and
at
the
same
time
denounced
those
who
for
political
causes
sought
their
subversion
but
though
the
monarchies
it
subverted
were
sometimes
tyrannical
and
the
seditions
it
prevented
sometimes
revolutionary
the
order
it
defended
or
sought
to
establish
was
never
legitimate
and
free
for
it
was
always
invested
with
the
function
of
religious
proselytism
and
with
the
obligation
of
removing
every
traditional
social
or
political
right
or
power
which
could
oppose
the
discharge
of
that
essential
duty
the
part
calvin
had
taken
in
the
death
of
servetus
obliged
him
to
develop
more
fully
his
views
on
the
punishment
of
heresy
he
wrote
a
short
account
of
the
trial
and
argued
that
governments
are
bound
to
suppress
heresy
and
that
those
who
deny
the
justice
of
the
punishment
themselves
deserve
it
the
book
was
signed
by
all
the
clergy
of
geneva
as
calvin
compurgators
it
was
generally
considered
a
failure
and
a
refutation
appeared
which
was
so
skilful
as
to
produce
a
great
sensation
in
the
protestant
world
this
famous
tract
now
of
extreme
rarity
did
not
as
has
been
said
contain
the
pith
of
those
arguments
which
have
ultimately
triumphed
in
almost
every
part
of
europe
nor
did
it
preach
an
unconditional
toleration
but
it
struck
hard
at
calvin
by
quoting
a
passage
from
the
first
edition
of
his
afterwards
omitted
in
which
he
spoke
for
toleration
some
of
those
says
the
author
whom
we
quote
have
subsequently
written
in
a
different
spirit
nevertheless
we
have
cited
the
earlier
opinion
as
the
true
one
as
it
was
expressed
under
the
pressure
of
persecution
the
first
edition
we
are
informed
by
calvin
himself
was
written
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
the
protestants
who
were
put
to
death
and
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
persecution
it
was
anonymous
and
naturally
dwelt
on
the
principles
of
toleration
although
this
book
did
not
denounce
all
intolerance
and
although
it
was
extremely
moderate
calvin
and
his
friends
were
filled
with
horror
what
remains
of
christianity
exclaimed
beza
if
we
silently
admit
what
this
man
has
expectorated
in
his
preface
since
the
beginning
of
christianity
no
such
blasphemy
was
ever
heard
beza
undertook
to
defend
calvin
in
an
elaborate
work
in
which
it
was
easy
for
him
to
cite
the
authority
of
all
the
leading
reformers
in
favour
of
the
practice
of
putting
heretics
to
death
and
in
which
he
reproduced
all
the
arguments
of
those
who
had
written
on
the
subject
before
him
more
systematic
than
calvin
he
first
of
all
excludes
those
who
are
not
christians
the
jews
turks
and
heathen
whom
his
inquiry
does
not
touch
among
christians
he
proceeds
to
say
some
are
schismatics
who
sin
against
the
peace
of
the
church
or
disbelievers
who
reject
her
doctrine
among
these
some
err
in
all
simplicity
and
if
their
error
is
not
very
grave
and
if
they
do
not
seduce
others
they
need
not
be
punished
but
obstinate
heretics
are
far
worse
than
parricides
and
deserve
death
even
if
they
repent
it
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
punish
them
for
the
whole
ecclesiastical
order
is
upheld
by
the
political
in
early
ages
this
power
was
exercised
by
the
temporal
sovereigns
they
convoked
councils
punished
heretics
promulgated
dogmas
the
papacy
afterwards
arose
in
evil
times
and
was
a
great
calamity
but
it
was
preferable
a
hundred
times
to
the
anarchy
which
was
defended
under
the
name
of
merciful
toleration
the
circumstances
of
the
condemnation
of
servetus
make
it
the
most
perfect
and
characteristic
example
of
the
abstract
intolerance
of
the
reformers
servetus
was
guilty
of
no
political
crime
he
was
not
an
inhabitant
of
geneva
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
it
and
nothing
immoral
could
be
attributed
to
him
he
was
not
even
an
advocate
of
absolute
toleration
the
occasion
of
his
apprehension
was
a
dispute
between
a
catholic
and
a
protestant
as
to
which
party
was
most
zealous
in
suppressing
egregious
errors
calvin
who
had
long
before
declared
that
if
servetus
came
to
geneva
he
should
never
leave
it
alive
did
all
he
could
to
obtain
his
condemnation
by
the
inquisition
at
vienne
at
geneva
he
was
anxious
that
the
sentence
should
be
death
and
in
this
he
was
encouraged
by
the
swiss
churches
but
especially
by
beza
farel
bullinger
and
peter
martyr
all
the
protestant
authorities
therefore
agreed
in
the
justice
of
putting
a
writer
to
death
in
whose
case
all
the
secondary
motives
of
intolerance
were
wanting
servetus
was
not
a
party
leader
he
had
no
followers
who
threatened
to
upset
the
peace
and
unity
of
the
church
his
doctrine
was
speculative
without
power
or
attraction
for
the
masses
like
lutheranism
and
without
consequences
subversive
of
morality
or
affecting
in
any
direct
way
the
existence
of
society
like
anabaptism
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
geneva
and
his
persecutors
would
have
rejoiced
if
he
had
been
put
to
death
elsewhere
bayle
says
hallam
has
an
excellent
remark
on
this
controversy
bayle
remark
is
as
follows
whenever
protestants
complain
they
are
answered
by
the
right
which
calvin
and
beza
recognised
in
magistrates
and
to
this
day
there
has
been
nobody
who
has
not
failed
pitiably
against
this
ad
no
question
of
the
merits
of
the
reformation
or
of
persecution
is
involved
in
an
inquiry
as
to
the
source
and
connection
of
the
opinions
on
toleration
held
by
the
protestant
reformers
no
man
sentiments
on
the
rightfulness
of
religious
persecution
will
be
affected
by
the
theories
we
have
described
and
they
have
no
bearing
whatever
on
doctrinal
controversy
those
who
in
agreement
with
the
principle
of
the
early
church
that
men
are
free
in
matters
of
conscience
condemn
all
intolerance
will
censure
catholics
and
protestants
alike
those
who
pursue
the
same
principle
one
step
farther
and
practically
invert
it
by
insisting
on
the
right
and
duty
not
only
of
professing
but
of
extending
the
truth
must
as
it
seems
to
us
approve
the
conduct
both
of
protestants
and
catholics
unless
they
make
the
justice
of
the
persecution
depend
on
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
defended
in
which
case
they
will
divide
on
both
sides
such
persons
again
as
are
more
strongly
impressed
with
the
cruelty
of
actual
executions
than
with
the
danger
of
false
theories
may
concentrate
their
indignation
on
the
catholics
of
languedoc
and
spain
while
those
who
judge
principles
not
by
the
accidental
details
attending
their
practical
realisation
but
by
the
reasoning
on
which
they
are
founded
will
arrive
at
a
verdict
adverse
to
the
protestants
these
comparative
inquiries
however
have
little
serious
interest
if
we
give
our
admiration
to
tolerance
we
must
remember
that
the
spanish
moors
and
the
turks
in
europe
have
been
more
tolerant
than
the
christians
and
if
we
admit
the
principle
of
intolerance
and
judge
its
application
by
particular
conditions
we
are
bound
to
acknowledge
that
the
romans
had
better
reason
for
persecution
than
any
modern
state
since
their
empire
was
involved
in
the
decline
of
the
old
religion
with
which
it
was
bound
up
whereas
no
christian
polity
has
been
subverted
by
the
mere
presence
of
religious
dissent
the
comparison
is
moreover
entirely
unreasonable
for
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
catholic
and
protestant
intolerance
the
church
began
with
the
principle
of
liberty
both
as
her
claim
and
as
her
rule
and
external
circumstances
forced
intolerance
upon
her
after
her
spirit
of
unity
had
triumphed
in
spite
both
of
the
freedom
she
proclaimed
and
of
the
persecutions
she
suffered
protestantism
set
up
intolerance
as
an
imperative
precept
and
as
a
part
of
its
doctrine
and
it
was
forced
to
admit
toleration
by
the
necessities
of
its
position
after
the
rigorous
penalties
it
imposed
had
failed
to
arrest
the
process
of
internal
dissolution
at
the
time
when
this
involuntary
change
occurred
the
sects
that
caused
it
were
the
bitterest
enemies
of
the
toleration
they
demanded
in
the
same
age
the
puritans
and
the
catholics
sought
a
refuge
beyond
the
atlantic
from
the
persecution
which
they
suffered
together
under
the
stuarts
flying
for
the
same

the
same
oppression
they
were
enabled
respectively
to
carry
out
their

in
the
colonies
which
they
founded
in
massachusetts
and

and
the
history
of
those
two

a

in
which

and
with
it
the

the

as
to
the
argument
that

spare

that
it

there
is
perhaps
no
stronger
contrast
between
the
revolutionary
times
in
which
we
live
and
the
catholic
ages
or
even
the
period
of
the

than
in
this
that
the
influence
which
religious
motives
formerly
possessed
is
now
in
a
great
measure
exercised
by
political
opinions
as
the
theory
of
the
balance
of
power
was
adopted
in
europe
as
a
substitute
for
the
influence
of
religious
ideas
incorporated
in
the
power
of
the
popes
so
now
political
zeal
occupies
the
place
made
vacant
by
the
decline
of
religious
fervour
and
commands
to
an
almost
equal
extent
the
enthusiasm
of
men
it
has
risen
to

at
the
expense
of

and
by
reason
of
its

naturally

the
dethroned
authority
with
the
jealousy
of
a
usurper
this
revolution
in
the
relative
position
of
religious
and
political
ideas
was
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
usurpation
by
the
protestant
state
of
the
functions
of
the
church
and
of
the
supremacy
which
in
the
modern
system
of
government
it
has
assumed
over
her
it
follows
also
that
the
false
principles
by
which
religious
truth
was
assailed
have
been
transferred
to
the
political
order
and
that
here
too
catholics
must
be
prepared
to
meet
them
whilst
the
objections
made
to
the
church
on
doctrinal
grounds
have
lost
much
of
their
attractiveness

enmity
she
provokes
on
political
grounds
is
more

old
enemy

new
face
no
reproach
is
more
common
no
argument
better
suited
to
the
temper
of
these
times
than
those
which
are
founded
on
the
supposed
inferiority
or
incapacity
of
the
church
in
political
matters
as
her
dogma
for
instance
is
assailed
from
opposite
sides
as
she
has
had
to
defend
the
divine
nature
of
christ
against
the
ebionites
and
his
humanity
against
docetism
and
was
attacked
both
on
the
plea
of
excessive
rigorism
and
excessive
laxity
clement

so
in
politics
she
is
arraigned
on
behalf
of
the
political
system
of
every
phase
of

she
was
accused
of
favouring
revolutionary
principles
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
and
james
and
of
absolutist
tendencies
under
james
ii
and
his
successors
since
protestant
england

each
of

the
sincerity
of
a
man
who
professes
to
study
and
admire
the
liberties
of
england
and
the
character
of
her
people
but
who
does
not
see
that
english
freedom
has
been
nurtured
from
the
earliest
times
by
resistance
to
papal
authority
and
established
by
the
blessing
of
a
reformed
religion
that
is
under

of
all
the
rights
we
possess
and
the
weight
we

materially

adulation
total
insensibility
not

to
the
worth

to
the

and
the
sacredness
of
public
and
private
right
these
are
the
malignant
and
deadly
features
which
we
see
stamped
upon
the
conduct
of
the
roman
hierarchy
besides
which
we
have
the
valuable
opinion
of
lord
derby
which
no
catholic
we
should
suppose
east
of
the
shannon
has
forgotten
that
catholicism
is
religiously
corrupt
and
politically
dangerous
lord
macaulay
tells
us
that
it
exclusively
promoted
the
power
of
the
crown
ranke
that
it
favours
revolution
and
regicide
whilst
the
belgian
and
sardinian
liberals
accuse
the
church
of
being
the
enemy
of
constitutional
freedom
the
celebrated
protestant
statesman
stahl
taunts
her
with
the
reproach
of
being
the
sole
support
and
pillar
of
the
belgian
constitution
thus
every
error
pronounces
judgment
on
itself
when
it
attempts
to
apply
its
rules
to
the
standard
of
truth
among
catholics
the

of
opinion
on
these
questions
whether
it
be
considered
the
result
of
unavoidable
circumstances
or
a
sign
of
ingenious
accommodation
or
a
thing
to
be
deplored
affords
at

a
glaring
refutation
of
the
idea
that
we
are
united
for
good
or
for
evil
in
one
common
political
system
the
church
is
vindicated
by
her
defenders
according
to
their
individual
inclinations
from
the
opposite
faults
imputed
to
her
she
is
lauded
according
to
circumstances
for
the
most
contradictory
merits
and
her
authority
is
invoked
in
exclusive
support
of
very
various
systems
count
de
montalembert
father
ventura
proclaim
her
liberal
constitutional
not
to
say
democratic
character
whilst
such
writers
as
bonald
and
father
taparelli
associate
her
with
the
cause
of
absolute
government
others
there
are
too
who
deny
that
the
church
has
a
political
tendency
or
preference
of
any
kind
who
assert
that
she
is
altogether
independent
of
and
indifferent
to
particular
political
institutions
and
while
insensible
to
their
influence
seeks
to
exercise
no
sort
of
influence
over
them
each
view
may
be
plausibly
defended
and
the
inexhaustible
arsenal
of
history
seems
to
provide
impartially
instances
in
corroboration
of
each
the
last
opinion
can
appeal
to
the
example
of
the
apostles
and
the
early
christians
for
whom
in
the
heathen
empire
the
only
part
was
unconditional
obedience
this
is
dwelt
upon
by
the
early
apologists

et

it
has
the
authority
too
of
those
who
thought
with
augustine
that
the
state
had
a
sinful
origin
and
character
primus
fuit
terrenae
civitatis
conditor
fratricida
the
liberals
at
the
same
time
are
strong
in
the
authority
of
many
scholastic
writers
and
of
many
of
the
older
jesuit
divines
of
thomas
and
suarez
bellarmine
and
mariana
the
absolutists
too
countenanced
by
bossuet
and
the
gallican
church
and
quoting
amply
from
the
old
testament
can
point
triumphantly
to
the
majority
of
catholic
countries
in
modern
times
all
these
arguments
are
at
the
same
time
serviceable
to
our
adversaries
and
those
by
which
one
objection
is
answered
help
to
fortify
another
the
frequent
recurrence
of
this
sort
of
argument
which
appears
to
us
as
treacherous
for
defence
as
it
is
popular
as
a
weapon
of
attack
shows
that
no
very
definite
ideas
prevail
on
the
subject
and
makes
it
doubtful
whether
history
which
passes
sentence
on
so
many
theories
is
altogether
consistent
with
any
of
these
nevertheless
it
is
obviously
an
inquiry
of
the
greatest
importance
and
one
on
which
controversy
can
never
entirely
be
set
at
rest
for
the
relation
of
the
spiritual
and
the
secular
power
is
like
that
of
speculation
and
revelation
of
religion
and
nature
one
of
those
problems
which
remain
perpetually
open
to
receive
light
from
the
meditations
and
experience
of
all
ages
and
the
complete
solution
of
which
is
among
the
objects
and
would
be
the
end
of
all
history
at
a
time
when
the
whole
system
of
ecclesiastical
government
was
under
discussion
and
when
the
temporal
power
was
beginning
to
predominate
over
the
church
in
france
the
greatest
theologian
of
the
age
made
an
attempt
to
apply
the
principles
of
secular
polity
to
the
church
according
to
gerson
ii
the
fundamental
forms
into
which
aristotle
divides
all
government
recur
in
the
ecclesiastical
system
the
royal
power
is
represented
in
the
papacy
the
aristocracy
by
the
college
of
cardinals
whilst
the
councils
form
an
ecclesiastical
democracy
analogous
to
this
is
the
idea
that
the
constitution
of
the
church
served
as
the
model
of
the
christian
states
and
that
the
notion
of
representation
for
instance
was
borrowed
from
it
but
it
is
not
by
the
analogy
of
her
own
forms
that
the
church
has
influenced
those
of
the
state
for
in
reality
there
is
none
subsisting
between
them
and
gerson
adoption
of
a
theory
of
grecian
origin
proves
that
he
scarcely
understood
the
spirit
of
that
mediæval
polity
which
in
his
own
country
especially
was
already
in
its
decay
for
not
only
is
the
whole
system
of
government
whether
we
consider
its
origin
its
end
or
its
means
absolutely
and
essentially
different
but
the
temporal
notion
of
power
is
altogether
unknown
in
the
church
ecclesia
subjectos
non
habet
ut
servos
sed
ut
filios
our
lord
himself
drew
the
distinction
reges

luc

the
supreme
authority
is
not
the
will
of
the
rulers
but
the
law
of
the
church
which
binds
those
who
are
its
administrators
as
strictly
as
those
who
have
only
to
obey
it
no
human
laws
were
ever
devised
which
could
so
thoroughly
succeed
in
making
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
power
impossible
as
that
prodigious
system
of
canon
law
which
is
the
ripe
fruit
of
the
experience
and
the
inspiration
of
eighteen
hundred
years
nothing
can
be
more
remote
from
the
political
notions
of
monarchy
than
the
authority
of
the
pope
with
even
less
justice
can
it
be
said
that
there
is
in
the
church
an
element
of
aristocracy
the
essence
of
which
is
the
possession
of
hereditary
personal
privileges
an
aristocracy
of
merit
and
of
office
can
not
in
a
political
sense
legitimately
bear
the
name
by
baptism
all
men
are
equal
before
the
church
yet
least
of
all
can
anything
be
detected
corresponding
to
the
democratic
principle
by
which
all
authority
resides
in
the
mass
of
individuals
and
which
gives
to
each
one
equal
rights
all
authority
in
the
church
is
delegated
and
recognises
no
such
thing
as
natural
rights
this
confusion
of
the
ideas
belonging
to
different
orders
has
been
productive
of
serious
and
dangerous
errors
whilst
heretics
have
raised
the
episcopate
to
a
level
with
the
papacy
the
priesthood
with
the
episcopate
the
laity
with
the
clergy
impugning
successively
the
primacy
the
episcopal
authority
and
the
sacramental
character
of
orders
the
application
of
ideas
derived
from
politics
to
the
system
of
the
church
led
to
the
exaggeration
of
the
papal
power
in
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
reformation
to
the
claim
of
a
permanent
aristocratic
government
by
the
council
of
basel
and
to
the
democratic
extravagance
of
the
observants
in
the
fourteenth
century
if
in
the
stress
of
conflicting
opinions
we
seek
repose
and
shelter
in
the
view
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
of
this
world
that
the
church
belonging
to
a
different
order
has
no
interest
in
political
forms
tolerates
them
all
and
is
dangerous
to
none
if
we
try
to
rescue
her
from
the
dangers
of
political
controversy
by
this
method
of
retreat
and
evasion
we
are
compelled
to
admit
her
inferiority
in
point
of
temporal
influence
to
every
other

system
every

all

by

therefore
in

towards

such
must
their

also
be
the

most
of
all
his

the

the
view
we
are
discussing
is
one
founded
on
timidity
and
a
desire
of
peace
but
peace
is
not
a
good
great
enough
to
be
purchased
by
such
sacrifices
we
must
be
prepared
to
do
battle
for
our
religious
system
in
every
other
sphere
as
well
as
in
that
of
doctrine
theological
error
affects
men
ideas
on
all
other
subjects
and
we
can
not
accept
in
politics
the
consequences
of
a
system
which
is
hateful
to
us
in
its
religious
aspect
these
questions
can
not
be
decided
by
mere
reasoning
but
we
may
obtain
some
light
by
inquiring
of
the
experience
of
history
our
only
sure
guide
is
the
example
of
the
church
herself
insolentissima

the
church
which
our
lord
came
to
establish
had
a
twofold
mission
to
fulfil
her
system
of
doctrine
on
the
one
hand
had
to
be
defined
and
perpetually
maintained
but
it
was
also
necessary
that
it
should
prove
itself
more
than
a
mere
matter
of
theory
that
it
should
pass
into
practice
and
command
the
will
as
well
as
the
intellect
of
men
it
was
necessary
not
only
to
restore
the
image
of
god
in
man
but
to
establish
the
divine
order
in
the
world
religion
had
to
transform
the
public
as
well
as
the
private
life
of
nations
to
effect
a
system
of
public
right
corresponding
with
private
morality
and
without
which
it
is
imperfect
and
insecure
it
was
to
exhibit
and
confirm
its
victory
and
to
perpetuate
its
influence
by
calling
into
existence
not
only
works
of
private
virtue
but
institutions
which
are
the
product
of
the
whole
life
of
nations
and
bear
an
unceasing
testimony
to
their
religious
sentiments
the
world
instead
of
being
external
to
the
church
was
to
be
adopted
by
her
and
imbued
with
her
ideas
the
first
the
doctrinal
or
intellectual
part
of
the
work
was
chiefly
performed
in
the
roman
empire
in
the
midst
of
the
civilisation
of
antiquity
and
of
that
unparalleled
intellectual
excitement
which
followed
the
presence
of
christ
on
earth
there
the
faith
was
prepared
for
the
world
whilst
the
world
was
not
yet
ready
to
receive
it
the
empire
in
which
was
concentrated
all
the
learning
and
speculation
of
ancient
times
was
by
its
intellectual
splendour
and
in
spite
we
might
even
say
by
reason
of
its
moral
depravity
the
fit
scene
of
the
intellectual
establishment
of
christianity
for
its
moral
degradation
ensured
the
most
violent
antipathy
and
hostility
to
the
new
faith
while
the
mental
cultivation
of
the
age
ensured
a
very
thorough
and
ingenious
opposition
and
supplied
those
striking
contrasts
which
were
needed
for
the
full
discussion
and
vigorous
development
of
the
christian
system
nowhere
else
and
at
no
other
period
could
such
advantages
have
been
found
but
for
the
other
equally
essential
part
of
her
work
the
church
met
with
an
insurmountable
obstacle
which
even
the
official
conversion
of
the
empire
and
all
the
efforts
of
the
christian
emperors
could
not
remove
this
obstacle
resided
not
so
much
in
the
resistance
of
paganism
as
a
religion
as
in
the
pagan
character
of
the
state
it
was
from
a
certain
political
sagacity
chiefly
that
the
romans
who
tolerated
all
religions
consistently
opposed
that
religion
which
threatened
inevitably
to
revolutionise
a
state
founded
on
a
heathen
basis
it
appeared
from
the
first
a
pernicious
superstition
exitiabilem
superstitionem
tacit
xv
that
taught
its
followers
to
be
bad
subjects
exuere
patriam
tacitus
and
to
be
constantly
dissatisfied
quibus
praesentia
semper
tempora
cum
enormi
libertate
displicent
vopiscus
this
hostility
continued
in
spite
of
the
protestations
of
every
apologist
and
of
the
submissiveness
and
sincere
patriotism
of
the
early
christians
they
were
so
far
from
recognising
what
their
enemies
so
vaguely
felt
that
the
empire
could
not
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
new
faith
that
it
was
the
common
belief
amongst
them
founded
perhaps
on
the
words
of
paul
thess
ii
that
the
roman
empire
would
last
to
the
end
of
the
world
the
persecution
of
julian
was
caused
by
the
feeling
of
the
danger
which
menaced
the
pagan
empire
from
the
christian
religion
his
hostility
was
not
founded
on
his
attachment
to
the
old
religion
of
rome
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
save
he
endeavoured
to
replace
it
by
a
new
system
which
was
to
furnish
the
state
with
new
vigour
to
withstand
the
decay
of
the
old
paganism
and
the
invasion
of
christianity
he
felt
that
the
old
religious
ideas
in
which
the
roman
state
had
grown
up
had
lost
their
power
and
that
rome
could
only
be
saved
by
opposing
at
all
hazards
the
new
ideas
he
was
inspired
rather
with
a
political
hatred
of
christianity
than
with
a
religious
love
of
paganism
consequently
christianity
was
the
only
religion
he
could
not
tolerate
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
persecution
of
the
church
on
principles
of
liberalism
and
religious
toleration
on
the
plea
of
political
necessity
by
men
who
felt
that
the
existing
forms
of
the
state
were
incompatible
with
her
progress
it
is
with
the
same
feeling
of
patriotic
aversion
for
the
church
that
symmachus
says
x
we
demand
the
restoration
of
that
religion
which
has
so
long
been
beneficial
to
the
state
of
that
worship
which
has
subdued
the
universe
to
our
laws
of
those
sacrifices
which
repulsed
hannibal
from
our
walls
and
the
gauls
from
the
capitol
very
soon
after
the
time
of
constantine
it
began
to
appear
that
the
outward
conversion
of
the
empire
was
a
boon
of
doubtful
value
to
religion
et

says
jerome
in
the
zeal
with
which
the
emperors
applied
the
secular
arm
for
the
promotion
of
christianity
was
felt
to
be
incompatible
with
its
spirit
and
with
its
interest
as
well
religion
says
lactantius
is
to
be
defended
by
exhorting
not
by
slaying
not
by
severity
but
by
patience
not
by

by

when
early
in
the
fifth
century
the
dismemberment
of
the
western
empire
commenced
it
was
clear
that
christianity
had
not
succeeded
in
reforming
the
society
and
the
polity
of
the
ancient
world
it
had
arrested
for
a
time
the
decline
of
the
empire
but
after
the
arian
separation
it
could
not
prevent
its
fall
the
catholics
could
not
dissociate
the
interests
of
the
church
and
those
of
the
roman
state
and
looked
with
patriotic
as
well
as
religious
horror
at
the
barbarians
by
whom
the
work
of
destruction
was
done
they
could
not
see
that
they
had
come
to
build
up
as
well
as
to
destroy
and
that
they
supplied
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
all
that
influence
which
had
failed
among
the
romans
it
was
very
late
before
they
understood
that
the
world
had
run
but
half
its
course
that
a
new
skin
had
been
prepared
to
contain
the
new
wine
and
that
the
barbarous
tribes
were
to
justify
their
claim
to
the
double
inheritance
of
the
faith
and
of
the
power
of
rome
there
were
two
principal
things
which
fitted
them
for
their
vocation
the
romans
had
been
unable
to
be
the
instruments
of
the
social
action
of
christianity
on
account
of
their
moral
depravity
it
was
precisely
for
those
virtues
in
which
they
were
most
deficient
that
their
barbarous
enemies
were
distinguished
salvianus
expresses
this
in
the
following
words
gubern
vii
miramur
si
terrae
nostrorum
omnium
a
deo
barbaris
datae
sunt
cum
eas
quae
romani
polluerant
fornicatione
nunc
mundent
barbari
castitate
whilst
thus
their
habits
met
the
morality
of
the
christian
system
their
mythology
which
was
the
very
crown
and
summit
of
all
pagan
religions
predisposed
them
in
like
manner
for
its
adoption
by
predicting
its
own
end
and
announcing
the
advent
of
a
system
which
was
to
displace
its
gods
it
was
more
than
a
mere
worldly
impulse
says
a
famous
northern
divine
that
urged
the
northern
nations
to
wander
forth
and
to
seek
like
birds
of
passage
a
milder
clime
we
can
not
however
say
more
on
the
predisposition
for
christianity
of
that
race
to
whose
hands
its
progress
seems
for
ever
committed
or
on
the
wonderful
facility
with
which
the
teutonic
invaders
accepted
it
whether
presented
to
them
in
the
form
of
catholicism
or
of
arianism
the
great
marvel
in
their
history
and
their
chief
claim
to
the
dominion
of
the
world
was
that
they
had
preserved
so
long
in
the
bleak
regions
in
which
the
growth
of
civilisation
was
in
every
way
retarded
the
virtues
together
with
the
ignorance
of
the
barbarous
state
at
a
time
when
arianism
was
extinct
in
the
empire
it
assumed
among
the
teutonic
tribes
the
character
of
a
national
religion
and
added
a
theological
incitement
to
their
animosity
against
the
romans
the
arian
tribes
to
whom
the
work
of
destruction
was
committed
did
it
thoroughly
but
they
soon
found
that
their
own
preservation
depended
on
their
submission
to
the
church
those
that
persisted
in
their
heresy
were
extirpated
the
lombards
and
visigoths
saved
themselves
by
a
tardy
conversion
from
the
fate
with
which
they
were
threatened
so
long
as
their
religion
estranged
them
from
the
roman
population
and
cut
them
off
from
the
civilisation
of
which
the
church
was
already
the
only
guardian
for
centuries
the
in
the
west
belonged
to
that
race
which
alone
became
catholic
at
once
and
never
swerved
from
its
orthodoxy
it
is
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
this
fidelity
which
dictated
the
preamble
of
the
salic
law
gens
francorum
inclita

condita

etc
then
followed
the
ages
which
are
not
unjustly
called
the
dark
ages
in
which
were
laid
the
foundations
of
all
the
happiness
that
has
been
since
enjoyed
and
of
all
the
greatness
that
has
been
achieved
by
men
the
good
seed
from
which
a
new
christian
civilisation
sprang
was
striking
root
in
the
ground
catholicism
appeared
as
the
religion
of
masses
in
those
times
of
simple
faith
there
was
no
opportunity
to
call
forth
an
augustine
or
an
athanasius
it
was
not
an
age
of
conspicuous
saints
but
sanctity
was
at
no
time
so
general
the
holy
men
of
the
first
centuries
shine
with
an
intense
brilliancy
from
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
corruption
legions
of
saints
individually
for
the
most
part
obscure
because
of
the
atmosphere
of
light
around
them
throng
the
five
illiterate
centuries
from
the
close
of
the
great
dogmatic
controversies
to
the
rise
of
a
new
theology
and
the
commencement
of
new
contests
with
hildebrand
anselm
and
bernard
all
the
manifestations
of
the
catholic
spirit
in
those
days
bear
a
character
of
vastness
and
popularity
a
single
idea
the
words
of
one
man
electrified
hundreds
of
thousands
in
such
a
state
of
the
world
the
christian
ideas
were
able
to
become
incarnate
so
to
speak
in
durable
forms
and
succeeded
in
animating
the
political
institutions
as
well
as
the
social
life
of
the
nations
the
facility
with
which
the
teutonic
ideas
of
government
shaped
themselves
to
the
mould
of
the
new
religion
was
the
second
point
in
which
that
race
was
so
peculiarly
adapted
for
the
position
it
has
ever
since
occupied
towards
christianity
they
ceased
to
be
barbarians
only
in
becoming
christians
their
political
system
was
in
its
infancy
and
was
capable
of
being
developed
variously
according
to
the
influences
it
might
undergo
there
was
no
hostile
civilisation
to
break
down
no
traditions
to
oppose
which
were
bound
up
with
the
recollections
of
the
national
greatness
the
state
is
so
closely
linked
with
religion
that
no
nation
that
has
changed
its
religion
has
ever
survived
in
its
old
political
form
in
rome
it
had
proved
to
be
impossible
to
alter
the
system
which
for
a
thousand
years
had
animated
every
portion
of
the
state
it
was
incurably
pagan
the
conversion
of
the
people
and
the
outward
alliance
with
the
church
could
not
make
up
for
this
inconsistency
but
the
teutonic
race
received
the
catholic
ideas
wholly
and
without
reserve
there
was
no
region
into
which
they
failed
to
penetrate
the
nation
was
collectively
catholic
as
well
as
individually
the
union
of
the
church
with
the
political
system
of
the
germans
was
so
complete
that
when
hungary
adopted
the
religion
of
rome
it
adopted
at
the
same
time
as
a
natural
consequence
the
institutions
of
the
empire
the
ideas
of
government
which
the
barbarians
carried
with
them
into
every
land
which
they
conquered
were
always
in
substance
the
same
the
of
the
middle
ages
consisting
of
those
states
in
which
the
teutonic
element
combined
with
the
catholic
system
was
governed
by
nearly
the
same
laws
the
mediæval
institutions
had
this
also
in
common
that
they
grew
up
everywhere
under
the
protection
and
guidance
of
the
church
and
whilst
they
subsisted
in
their
integrity
her
influence
in
every
nation
and
that
of
the
pope
over
all
the
nations
attained
their
utmost
height
in
proportion
as
they
have
since
degenerated
or
disappeared
the
political
influence
of
religion
has
declined
as
we
have
seen
that
the
church
was
baffled
in
the
full
performance
of
her
mission
before
europe
was
flooded
by
the
great
migration
so
it
may
be
said
that
she
has
never
permanently
enjoyed
her
proper
position
and
authority
in
any
country
where
it
did
not
penetrate
no
other
political
system
has
yet
been
devised
which
was
consistent
with
the
full
development
and
action
of
catholic
principles
but
that
which
was
constructed
by
the
northern
barbarians
who
destroyed
the
western
empire
from
this
it
does
not
seem
too
much
to
conclude
that
the
catholic
religion
tends
to
inspire
and
transform
the
public
as
well
as
the
private
life
of
men
that
it
is
not
really
master
of
one
without
some
authority
over
the
other
consequently
where
the
state
is
too
powerful
by
long
tradition
and
custom
or
too
far
gone
in
corruption
to
admit
of
the
influence
of
religion
it
can
only
prevail
by
ultimately
destroying
the
political
system
this
helps
us
to
understand
the
almost
imperceptible
progress
of
christianity
against
mahometanism
and
the
slowness
of
its
increase
in
china
where
its
growth
must
eventually
undermine
the
whole
fabric
of
government
on
the
other
hand
we
know
with
what
ease
comparatively
savage
tribes
as
the
natives
of
california
and
paraguay
were
converted
to
a
religion
which
first
initiated
them
in
civilisation
and
government
there
are
countries
in
which
the
natural
conditions
are
yet
wanting
for
the
kingdom
of
grace
there
is
a
fulness
of
time
for
every
nation
a
time
at
which
it
first
becomes
capable
of
receiving
the
faith
it
is
not
harder
to
believe
that
certain
political
conditions
are
required
to
make
a
nation
fit
for
conversion
than
that
a
certain
degree
of
intellectual
development
is
indispensable
that
the
language
for
instance
must
have
reached
a
point
which
that
of
some
nations
has
not
attained
before
it
is
capable
of
conveying
the
truths
of
christianity
we
can
not
therefore
admit
that
political
principles
are
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
to
the
church
to
what
sort
of
principles
it
is
that
she
inclines
may
be
indicated
by
a
single
example
the
christian
notion
of
conscience
imperatively
demands
a
corresponding
measure
of
personal
liberty
the
feeling
of
duty
and
responsibility
to
god
is
the
only
arbiter
of
a
christian
actions
with
this
no
human
authority
can
be
permitted
to
interfere
we
are
bound
to
extend
to
the
utmost
and
to
guard
from
every
encroachment
the
sphere
in
which
we
can
act
in
obedience
to
the
sole
voice
of
conscience
regardless
of
any
other
consideration
the
church
can
not
tolerate
any
species
of
government
in
which
this
right
is
not
recognised
she
is
the
irreconcilable
enemy
of
the
despotism
of
the
state
whatever
its
name
or
its
forms
may
be
and
through
whatever
instruments
it
may
be
exercised
where
the
state
allows
the
largest
amount
of
this
autonomy
the
subject
enjoys
the
largest
measure
of
freedom
and
the
church
the
greatest
legitimate
influence
the
republics
of
antiquity
were
as
incapable
as
the
oriental
despotisms
of
satisfying
the
christian
notion
of
freedom
or
even
of
subsisting
with
it
the
church
has
succeeded
in
producing
the
kind
of
liberty
she
exacts
for
her
children
only
in
those
states
which
she
has
herself
created
or
transformed
real
freedom
has
been
known
in
no
state
that
did
not
pass
through
her
mediæval
action
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
is
the
history
of
the
gradual
emancipation
of
man
from
every
species
of
servitude
in
proportion
as
the
influence
of
religion
became
more
penetrating
and
more
universal
the
church
could
never
abandon
that
principle
of
liberty
by
which
she
conquered
pagan
rome
the
history
of
the
last
three
centuries
exhibits
the
gradual
revival
of
declining
slavery
which
appears
under
new
forms
of
oppression
as
the
authority
of
religion
has
decreased
the
efforts
of
deliverance
have
been
violent
and
reactionary
the
progress
of
dependence
sure
and
inevitable
the
political
benefits
of
the
mediæval
system
have
been
enjoyed
by
no
nation
which
is
destitute
of
teutonic
elements
the
slavonic
races
of
the
the
celtic
tribes
of
the
were
deprived
of
them
in
the
centre
of
mediæval
civilisation
the
republic
of
venice
proud
of
its
unmixed
descent
from
the
romans
was
untouched
by
the
new
blood
and
that
christian
people
failed
to
obtain
a
christian
government
where
the
influence
of
the
ideas
which
prevailed
in
those
times
has
not
been
felt
the
consequence
has
been
the
utmost
development
of
extreme
principles
such
as
have
doomed
asia
for
so
many
ages
to
perpetual
stagnation
and
america
to
endless
heedless
change
it
is
a
plain
fact
that
that
kind
of
liberty
which
the
church
everywhere
and
at
all
times
requires
has
been
attained
hitherto
only
in
states
of
teutonic
origin
we
need
hardly
glance
at
the
importance
of
this
observation
in
considering
the
missionary
vocation
of
the
english
race
in
the
distant
regions
it
has
peopled
and
among
the
nations
it
has
conquered
for
in
spite
of
its
religious
apostasy
no
other
country
has
preserved
so
pure
that
idea
of
liberty
which
gave
to
religion
of
old
its
power
in
europe
and
is
still
the
foundation
of
the
greatness
of
england
other
nations
that
have
preserved
more
faithfully
their
allegiance
to
the
church
have
more
decidedly
broken
with
those
political
traditions
without
which
the
action
of
the
church
is
fettered
it
is
equally
clear
that
in
insisting
upon
one
definite
principle
in
all
government
the
church
has
at
no
time
understood
that
it
could
be
obtained
only
by
particular
political
forms
she
attends
to
the
substance
not
to
the
form
in
politics
at
various
times
she
has
successively
promoted
monarchy
aristocracy
and
democracy
and
at
various
times
she
has
been
betrayed
by
each
the
three
fundamental
forms
of
all
government
are
founded
on
the
nature
of
things
sovereignty
must
reside
with
an
individual
or
with
a
minority
or
with
the
majority
but
there
are
seasons
and
circumstances
where
one
or
the
other
is
impossible
where
one
or
the
other
is
necessary
and
in
a
growing
nation
they
can
not
always
remain
in
the
same
relative
proportions
christianity
could
neither
produce
nor
abolish
them
they
are
all
compatible
with
liberty
and
religion
and
are
all
liable
to
diverge
into
tyranny
by
the
exclusive
exaggeration
of
their
principle
it
is
this
exaggeration
that
has
ever
been
the
great
danger
to
religion
and
to
liberty
and
the
object
of
constant
resistance
the
source
of
constant
suffering
for
the
church
christianity
introduced
no
new
forms
of
government
but
a
new
spirit
which
totally
transformed
the
old
ones
the
difference
between
a
christian
and
a
pagan
monarchy
or
between
a
christian
and
a
rationalist
democracy
is
as
great
politically
as
that
between
a
monarchy
and
a
republic
the
government
of
athens
more
nearly
resembled
that
of
persia
than
that
of
any
christian
republic
however
democratic
if
political
theorists
had
attended
more
to
the
experience
of
the
christian
ages
the
church
and
the
state
would
have
been
spared
many
calamities
unfortunately
it
has
long
been
the
common
practice
to
recur
to
the
authority
of
the
greeks
and
the
jews
the
example
of
both
was
equally
dangerous
for
in
the
jewish
as
in
the
gentile
world
political
and
religious
obligations
were
made
to
coincide
in
both
therefore
in
the
theocracy
of
the
jews
as
in
the
greek
politeia
of
the
greeks
the
state
was
absolute
now
it
is
the
great
object
of
the
church
by
keeping
the
two
spheres
permanently
distinct
by
rendering
to
cæsar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
and
to
god
the
things
that
are
god
to
make
all
absolutism
of
whatever
kind
impossible
as
no
form
of
government
is
in
itself
incompatible
with
tyranny
either
of
a
person
or
a
principle
nor
necessarily
inconsistent
with
liberty
there
is
no
natural
hostility
or
alliance
between
the
church
and
any
one
of
them
the
same
church
which
in
the
confusion
and
tumult
of
the
great
migrations
restored
authority
by
raising
up
and
anointing
kings
held
in
later
times
with
the
aristocracy
of
the
empire
and
called
into
existence
the
democracies
of
italy
in
the
eighth
century
she
looked
to
charlemagne
for
the
reorganisation
of
society
in
the
eleventh
she
relied
on
the
people
to
carry
out
the
reformation
of
the
clergy
during
the
first
period
of
the
middle
ages
when
social
and
political
order
had
to
be
reconstructed
out
of
ruins
the
church
everywhere
addresses
herself
to
the
kings
and
seeks
to
strengthen
and
to
sanctify
their
power
the
royal
as
well
as
the
imperial
dignity
received
from
her
their
authority
and
splendour
whatever
her
disputes
on
religious
grounds
with
particular
sovereigns
such
as
lothar
she
had
in
those
ages
as
yet
no
contests
with
the
encroachments
of
monarchical
power
later
on
in
the
middle
ages
on
the
contrary
when
the
monarchy
had
prevailed
almost
everywhere
and
had
strengthened
itself
beyond
the
limits
of
feudal
ideas
by
the
help
of
the
roman
law
and
of
the
notions
of
absolute
power
derived
from
the
ancients
it
stood
in
continual
conflict
with
the
church
from
the
time
of
gregory
all
the
most
distinguished
pontiffs
were
engaged
in
quarrels
with
the
royal
and
imperial
power
which
resulted
in
the
victory
of
the
church
in
germany
and
her
defeat
in
france
in
this
resistance
to
the
exaggeration
of
monarchy
they
naturally
endeavoured
to
set
barriers
to
it
by
promoting
popular
institutions
as
the
italian
democracies
and
the
aristocratic
republics
of
switzerland
and
the
capitulations
which
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
were
imposed
on
almost
every
prince
times
had
greatly
changed
when
a
pope
declared
his
amazement
at
a
nation
which
bore
in
silence
the
tyranny
of
their
king
in
modern
times
the
absolute
monarchy
in
catholic
countries
has
been
next
to
the
reformation
the
greatest
and
most
formidable
enemy
of
the
church
for
here
she
again
lost
in
great
measure
her
natural
influence
in
france
spain
and
germany
by
gallicanism
josephism
and
the
inquisition
she
came
to
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
dependence
the
more
fatal
and
deplorable
that
the
clergy
were
often
instrumental
in
maintaining
it
all
these
phenomena
were
simply
an
adaptation
of
catholicism
to
a
political
system
incompatible
with
it
in
its
integrity
an
artifice
to
accommodate
the
church
to
the
requirements
of
absolute
government
and
to
furnish
absolute
princes
with
a
resource
which
was
elsewhere
supplied
by
protestantism
the
consequence
has
been
that
the
church
is
at
this
day
more
free
under
protestant
than
under
catholic
governments
in
prussia
or
england
than
in
france
or
piedmont
naples
or
bavaria
as
we
have
said
that
the
church
commonly
allied
herself
with
the
political
elements
which
happened
to
be
insufficiently
represented
and
to
temper
the
predominant
principle
by
encouraging
the
others
it
might
seem
hardly
unfair
to
conclude
that
that
kind
of
government
in
which
they
are
all
supposed
to
be
combined
aequatum
et
temperatum
ex
tribus
optimis
rerum
publicarum
modis
cicero
i
must
be
particularly
suited
to
her
practically
and
we
are
not
here
pursuing
a
theory
this
is
a
mere
fallacy
if
we
look
at
catholic
countries
we
find
that
in
spain
and
piedmont
the
constitution
has
served
only
to
pillage
oppress
and
insult
the
church
whilst
in
austria
since
the
empire
has
been
purified
in
the
fiery
ordeal
of
the
revolution
she
is
free
secure
and
on
the
highroad
of
in
constitutional
bavaria
she
has
but
little
protection
against
the
crown
or
in
belgium
against
the
mob
the
royal
power
is
against
her
in
one
place
the
popular
element
in
the
other
turning
to
protestant
countries
we
find
that
in
prussia
the
church
is
comparatively
free
whilst
the
more
popular
government
of
baden
has
exhibited
the
most
conspicuous
instance
of
oppression
which
has
occurred
in
our
time
the
popular
government
of
sweden
again
has
renewed
the
refusal
of
religious
toleration
at
the
very
time
when
despotic
russia
begins
to
make
a
show
at
least
of
conceding
it
in
the
presence
of
these
facts
it
would
surely
be
absurd
to
assume
that
the
church
must
look
with
favour
on
the
feeble
and
transitory
constitutions
with
which
the
revolution
has
covered
half
the
continent
it
does
not
actually
appear
that
she
has
derived
greater
benefits
from
them
than
she
may
be
said
to
have
done
from
the
revolution
itself
which
in
france
for
instance
in
gave
to
the
church
at
least
for
a
season
that
liberty
and
dignity
for
which
she
had
struggled
in
vain
during
the
constitutional
period
which
had
preceded
the
political
character
of
our
own
country
bears
hardly
more
resemblance
to
the
liberal
governments
of
the
continent
which
have
copied
only
what
is
valueless
in
our
institutions
than
to
the
superstitious
despotism
of
the
east
or
to
the
analogous
tyranny
which
in
the
far
west
is
mocked
with
the
name
of
freedom
here
as
elsewhere
the
progress
of
the
constitution
which
it
was
the
work
of
the
catholic
ages
to
build
up
on
the
principles
common
to
all
the
nations
of
the
teutonic
stock
was
interrupted
by
the
attraction
which
the
growth
of
absolutism
abroad
excited
and
by
the
reformation
transferring
the
ecclesiastical
power
to
the
crown
the
stuarts
justified
their
abuse
of
power
by
the
same
precepts
and
the
same
examples
by
which
the
puritans
justified
their
resistance
to
it
the
liberty
aimed
at
by
the
levellers
was
as
remote
from
that
which
the
middle
ages
had
handed
down
as
the
power
of
the
stuarts
from
the
mediæval
monarchy
the
revolution
of
destroyed
one
without
favouring
the
other
unlike
the
rebellion
against
charles
that
which
overthrew
his
son
did
not
fall
into
a
contrary
extreme
it
was
a
restoration
in
some
sort
of
the
principles
of
government
which
had
been
alternately
assailed
by
absolute
monarchy
and
by
a
fanatical
democracy
but
as
it
was
directed
against
the
abuse
of
kingly
and
ecclesiastical
authority
neither
the
crown
nor
the
established
church
recovered
their
ancient
position
and
a
jealousy
of
both
has
ever
since
subsisted
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
the
remnants
of
the
old
system
of
polity
the
utter
disappearance
of
which
keeps
the
rest
of
christendom
in
a
state
of
continual
futile
revolution
exist
more
copiously
in
this
country
than
in
any
other
instead
of
the
revolutions
and
the
religious
wars
by
which
in
other
protestant
countries
catholics
have
obtained
toleration
they
have
obtained
it
in
england
by
the
force
of
the
very
principles
of
the
constitution
i
should
think
myself
inconsistent
says
the
chief
expounder
of
our
political
system
in
not
applying
my
ideas
of
civil
liberty
to
religious
and
speaking
of
the
relaxation
of
the
penal
laws
he
says
to
the
great
liberality
and
enlarged
sentiments
of
those
who
are
the
furthest
in
the
world
from
you
in
religious
tenets
and
the
furthest
from
acting
with
the
party
which
it
is
thought
the
greater
part
of
the
roman
catholics
are
disposed
to
espouse
it
is
that
you
owe
the
whole
or
very
nearly
the
whole
of
what
has
been
done
both
here
and
in
ireland
the
danger
which
menaces
the
continuance
of
our
constitution
proceeds
simply
from
the
oblivion
of
those
christian
ideas
by
which
it
was
originally
inspired
it
should
seem
that
it
is
the
religious
as
well
as
the
political
duty
of
catholics
to
endeavour
to
avert
this
peril
and
to
defend
from
the
attacks
of
the
radicals
and
from
the
contempt
of
the
tories
the
only
constitution
which
bears
some
resemblance
to
those
of
catholic
times
and
the
principles
which
are
almost
as
completely
forgotten
in
england
as
they
are
misunderstood
abroad
if
three
centuries
of
protestantism
have
not
entirely
obliterated
the
ancient
features
of
our
government
if
they
have
not
been
so
thoroughly
barren
of
political
improvement
as
some
of
its
enemies
would
have
us
believe
there
is
surely
nothing
to
marvel
at
nothing
at
which
we
may
rejoice
protestants
may
well
have
in
some
respects
the
same
terrestrial
superiority
over
catholics
that
the
gentiles
had
over
the
people
of
god
as
at
the
fall
of
paganism
the
treasures
it
had
produced
and
accumulated
during
two
thousand
years
became
the
spoils
of
the
victor
when
the
day
of
reckoning
shall
come
for
the
great
modern
apostasy
it
will
surrender
all
that
it
has
gathered
in
its
diligent
application
to
the
things
of
this
world
and
those
who
have
remained
in
the
faith
will
have
into
the
bargain
those
products
of
the
protestant
civilisation
on
which
its
claims
of
superiority
are
founded
when
therefore
in
the
political
shipwreck
of
modern
europe
it
is
asked
which
political
form
of
party
is
favoured
by
the
church
the
only
answer
we
can
give
is
that
she
is
attached
to
none
but
that
though
indifferent
to
existing
forms
she
is
attached
to
a
spirit
which
is
nearly
extinct
those
who
from
a
fear
of
exposing
her
to
political
animosity
would
deny
this
forget
that
the
truth
is
as
strong
against
political
as
against
religious
error
and
shut
their
eyes
to
the
only
means
by
which
the
political
regeneration
of
the
modern
world
is
a
possibility
for
the
catholic
religion
alone
will
not
suffice
to
save
it
as
it
was
insufficient
to
save
the
ancient
world
unless
the
catholic
idea
equally
manifests
itself
in
the
political
order
the
church
alone
without
influence
on
the
state
is
powerless
as
a
security
for
good
government
it
is
absurd
to
pretend
that
at
the
present
day
france
or
spain
or
naples
are
better
governed
than
england
holland
or
prussia
a
country
entirely
protestant
may
have
more
catholic
elements
in
its
government
than
one
where
the
population
is
wholly
catholic
the
state
which
is
catholic
is
a
for
misgovernment
because
the
orthodoxy
and
piety
of
its
administrators
are
deemed
a
substitute
for
a
better
system
the
demand
for
a
really
catholic
system
of
government
falls
with
the
greatest
weight
of
reproach
on
the
catholic
states
yet
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
the
ages
of
faith
the
same
unity
prevailed
in
political
ideas
and
that
the
civil
as
well
as
the
religious
troubles
of
our
time
are
in
great
measure
due
to
the
reformation
it
is
common
to
advise
catholics
to
make
up
their
minds
to
accept
the
political
doctrines
of
the
day
but
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
recall
the
ideas
of
catholic
times
it
is
not
in
the
results
of
the
political
development
of
the
last
three
centuries
that
the
church
can
place
her
trust
neither
in
absolute
monarchy
nor
in
the
revolutionary
liberalism
nor
in
the
infallible
constitutional
scheme
she
must
create
anew
or
revive
her
former
creations
and
instil
a
new
life
and
spirit
into
those
remains
of
the
mediæval
system
which
will
bear
the
mark
of
the
ages
when
heresy
and
unbelief
roman
law
and
heathen
philosophy
had
not
obscured
the
idea
of
the
christian
state
these
remains
are
to
be
found
in
various
stages
of
decay
in
every
state
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
france
that
grew
out
of
the
mediæval
civilisation
above
all
they
will
be
found
in
the
country
which
in
the
midst
of
its
apostasy
and
in
spite
of
so
much
guilt
towards
religion
has
preserved
the
catholic
forms
in
its
church
establishment
more
than
any
other
protestant
nation
and
the
catholic
spirit
in
her
political
institutions
more
than
any
catholic
nation
to
renew
the
memory
of
the
times
in
which
this
spirit
prevailed
in
europe
and
to
preserve
the
remains
of
it
to
promote
the
knowledge
of
what
is
lost
and
the
desire
of
what
is
most
urgently
needed
is
an
important
service
and
an
important
duty
which
it
behoves
us
to
perform
we
are
greatly
mistaken
if
these
are
not
reflections
which
force
themselves
on
every
one
who
carefully
observes

of

burd
has
undertaken
to
redeem
our
long
inferiority
in
machiavellian
studies

it
will
i
think
be
found
that
he
has
given
a
more
completely
satisfactory
explanation
of
than
any
country
possessed
before
his
annotated
edition
supplies
all
the
solvents
of
a
famous
problem
in
the
history

and
the
literature
of

in
truth
the
ancient
problem
is
extinct
and
no
reader
of
this
volume
will
continue
to
wonder
how
so
intelligent
and
reasonable
a
man
came
to
propose
such
flagitious
counsels
when
machiavelli
declared
that
extraordinary
objects
can
not
be
accomplished
under
ordinary
rules
he
recorded
the
experience
of
his
own
epoch
but
also
foretold
the
secret
of
men
since
born
he
illustrates
not
only
the
generation
which
taught
him
but
the
generations
which
he
taught
and
has
no
less
in

with
the

who
had
his
precepts
before
them
than
with
the
viscontis
borgias
and
baglionis

were
the
masters
he
observed
he
represents
more
than
the
spirit
of
his
country
and
his
age
knowledge
civilisation
and
morality
have
increased
but
three
centuries
have
borne
enduring
witness
to
his
political
veracity

has
been

of
men
whom
posterity
esteems

the

defended
the

of

vanishing
type
but
a
constant
and
contemporary
influence
where
it
is
impossible
to
praise
to
defend
or
to
excuse
the
burden
of
blame
may
yet
be
lightened
by
adjustment
and
distribution
and
he
is
more
rationally
intelligible
when
illustrated
by
lights
falling
not
only
from
the
century
he
wrote
in
but
from
our
own
which
has
seen
the
course
of
its

viii
goldwin
smith
irish
history
when
macaulay
republished
his
essays
from
the
he
had
already
commenced
the
great
work
by
which
his
name
will
be
remembered
and
he
had
the
prudence
to
exclude
from
the
collection
his
early
paper
on
the
art
of
historical
writing
in
the
maturity
of
his
powers
he
was
rightly
unwilling
to
bring
into
notice
the
theories
of
his
youth
at
a
time
when
he
was
about
to
claim
a
place
among
the
first
historians
it
would
have
been
injudicious
to
remind
men
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
described
the
objects
of
his
emulation
or
of
his
rivalry
how
in
his
judgment
the
speeches
of
thucydides
violate
the
decencies
of
fiction
and
give
to
his
book
something
of
the
character
of
the
chinese
whilst
his
political
observations
are
very
superficial
how
polybius
has
no
other
merit
than
that
of
a
faithful
narrator
of
facts
and
how
in
the
nineteenth
century
from
the
practice
of
distorting
narrative
in
conformity
with
theory
history
proper
is
disappearing
but
in
that
essay
although
the
judgments
are
puerile
the
ideal
at
which
the
writer
afterwards
aimed
is
distinctly
drawn
and
his
own
character
is
prefigured
in
the
description
of
the
author
of
a
history
of
england
as
it
ought
to
be
who
gives
to
truth
those
attractions
which
have
been
usurped
by
fiction
intersperses
the
details
which
are
the
charm
of
historical
romances
and
reclaims
those
materials
which
the
novelist
has
appropriated
goldwin
smith
like
macaulay
has
written
on
the
study
of
history
and
he
has
been
a
keen
critic
of
other
historians
before
becoming
one
himself
it
is
a
bold
thing
for
a
man
to
bring
theory
so
near
to
execution
and
amidst
dispute
on
his
principles
and
resentment
at
his
criticism
to
give
an
opportunity
of
testing
his
theories
by
his
own
practice
and
of
applying
his
own
canons
to
his
performance
it
reminds
us
of
the
professor
of
cologne
who
wrote
the
best
latin
poem
of
modern
times
as
a
model
for
his
pupils
and
of
the
author
of
an
attack
on
dryden
who
is
styled
by
pope
the
fairest
of
critics
because
says
johnson
he
exhibited
his
own
version
to
be
compared
with
that
which
he
condemned
the
work
in
which
the
professor
of
history
and
critic
of
historians
teaches
by
example
is
not
unworthy
of
his
theory
whilst
some
of
its
defects
may
be
explained
by
it
the
point
which
most
closely
connects
goldwin
smith
previous
writings
with
his
is
his
vindication
of
a
moral
code
against
those
who
identify
moral
with
physical
laws
who
consider
the
outward
regularity
with
which
actions
are
done
to
be
the
inward
reason
why
they
must
be
done
and
who
conceive
that
all
laws
are
opposed
to
freedom
in
his
opposition
to
this
materialism
he
goes
in
one
respect
too
far
in
another
not
far
enough
on
the
one
hand
whilst
defending
liberty
and
morality
he
has
not
sufficient
perception
of
the
spiritual
element
and
on
the
other
he
seems
to
fear
that
it
would
be
a
concession
to
his
antagonists
to
dwell
on
the
constant
laws
by
which
nature
asserts
herself
and
on
the
regularity
with
which
like
causes
produce
like
effects
yet
it
is
on
the
observation
of
these
laws
that
political
social
and
economical
science
rests
and
it
is
by
the
knowledge
of
them
that
a
scientific
historian
is
guided
in
grouping
his
matter
in
this
he
differs
from
the
artist
whose
principle
of
arrangement
is
drawn
from
himself
not
from
external
nature
and
from
the
annalist
who
has
no
arrangement
since
he
sees
not
the
connection
but
the
succession
of
events
facts
are
intelligible
and
instructive
or
in
other
words
history
exhibits
truths
as
well
as
facts
when
they
are
seen
not
merely
as
they
follow
but
as
they
correspond
not
merely
as
they
have
happened
but
as
they
are
paralleled
the
fate
of
ireland
is
to
be
understood
not
simply
from
the
light
of
english
and
irish
history
but
by
the
general
history
of
other
conquests
colonies
dependencies
and
establishments
in
this
sort
of
illustration
by
analogy
and
contrast
goldwin
smith
is
particularly
infelicitous
nor
does
providence
gain
what
science
loses
by
his
treatment
of
history
he
rejects
materialism
but
he
confines
his
view
to
motives
and
forces
which
are
purely
human
the
catholic
church
receives
therefore
very
imperfect
measure
at
his
hands
her
spiritual
character
and
purpose
he
can
not
discern
behind
the
temporal
instruments
and
appendages
of
her
existence
he
confounds
authority
with
influence
devotion
with
bigotry
power
with
force
of
arms
and
estimates
the
vigour
and
durability
of
catholicism
by
criterions
as
material
as
those
of
the
philosophers
he
has
so
vehemently
and
so
ably
refuted
most
protestant
writers
fail
in
approbation
he
fails
in
appreciation
it
is
not
so
much
a
religious
feeling
that
makes
him
unjust
as
a
way
of
thinking
which
in
great
measure
ignores
the
supernatural
and
therefore
precludes
a
just
estimate
of
religion
in
general
and
of
catholicism
in
particular
hence
he
is
unjust
rather
to
the
nature
than
to
the
actions
of
the
church
he
caricatures
more
than
he
libels
her
he
is
much
less
given
to
misrepresentation
and
calumny
than
macaulay
but
he
has
a
less
exalted
idea
of
the
history
and
character
of
catholicism
as
he
underrates
what
is
divine
so
he
has
no
very
high
standard
for
the
actions
of
men
and
he
is
liberal
in
admitting
extenuating
circumstances
though
he
never
suspends
the
severity
of
his
moral
judgment
in
consideration
of
the
purpose
or
the
result
yet
he
is
induced
by
a
variety
of
arguments
to
mitigate
its
rigour
in
accordance
with
the
theory
he
has
formerly
developed
he
is
constantly
sitting
in
judgment
and
he
discusses
the
morality
of
men
and
actions
far
oftener
than
history
which
has
very
different
problems
to
solve
either
requires
or
tolerates
de
maistre
says
that
in
our
time
compassion
is
reserved
for
the
guilty
goldwin
smith
is
a
merciful
judge
whose
compassion
generally
increases
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
the
culprit
and
he
has
a
sympathy
for
what
is
done
in
the
grand
style
which
balances
his
hatred
of
what
is
wrongly
done
it
would
not
be
fair
to
judge
of
an
author
notion
and
powers
of
research
by
a
hasty
and
popular
production
goldwin
smith
has
collected
quite
enough
information
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
has
used
it
and
he
has
not
failed
through
want
of
industry
the
test
of
solidity
is
not
the
quantity
read
but
the
mode
in
which
the
knowledge
has
been
collected
and
used
method
not
genius
or
eloquence
or
erudition
makes
the
historian
he
may
be
discovered
most
easily
by
his
use
of
authorities
the
first
question
is
whether
the
writer
understands
the
comparative
value
of
sources
of
information
and
has
the
habit
of
giving
precedence
to
the
most
trustworthy
informant
there
are
some
vague
indications
that
goldwin
smith
does
not
understand
the
importance
of
this
fundamental
rule
in
his
inaugural
lecture
published
two
years
ago
the
following
extravagant
sentence
occurs
before
the
revolution
the
fervour
and
the
austerity
of
rousseau
had
cast
out
from
good
society
the
levity
and
sensuality
of
voltaire
this
view
which
he
appears
to
have
abandoned
for
in
his
he
tells
us
that
france
has
now
become
the
eldest
daughter
of
voltaire
he
supports
by
a
reference
to
an
abridgment
of
french
history
much
and
justly
esteemed
in
french
schools
but
like
all
abridgments
not
founded
on
original
knowledge
and
disfigured
by
exaggeration
in
the
colouring
moreover
the
passage
he
refers
to
has
been
misinterpreted
in
the
goldwin
smith
quotes
for
the
character
of
the
early
celts
without
any
sufficient
reason
another
french
historian
martin
who
has
no
great
authority
and
the
younger
thierry
who
has
none
at
all
this
is
a
point
of
very
little
weight
by
itself
but
until
our
author
vindicates
his
research
by
other
writings
it
is
not
in
his
favour
the
defects
of
goldwin
smith
historic
art
his
lax
criticism
his
superficial
acquaintance
with
foreign
countries
his
occasional
proneness
to
sacrifice
accuracy
for
the
sake
of
rhetorical
effect
his
aversion
for
spiritual
things
are
all
covered
by
one
transcendent
merit
which
in
a
man
of
so
much
ability
promises
great
results
writers
the
most
learned
the
most
accurate
in
details
and
the
soundest
in
tendency
frequently
fall
into
a
habit
which
can
neither
be
cured
nor
pardoned
the
habit
of
making
history
into
the
proof
of
their
theories
the
absence
of
a
definite
didactic
purpose
is
the
only
security
for
the
good
faith
of
a
historian
this
most
rare
virtue
goldwin
smith
possesses
in
a
high
degree
he
writes
to
tell
the
truths
he
finds
not
to
prove
the
truths
which
he
believes
in
character
and
design
he
is
eminently
truthful
and
fair
though
not
equally
so
in
execution
his
candour
never
fails
him
and
he
is
never
betrayed
by
his
temper
yet
his
defective
knowledge
of
general
history
and
his
crude
notions
of
the
church
have
made
him
write
many
things
which
are
untrue
and
some
which
are
unjust
prejudice
is
in
all
men
of
such
early
growth
and
so
difficult
to
eradicate
that
it
becomes
a
misfortune
rather
than
a
reproach
especially
if
it
is
due
to
ignorance
and
not
to
passion
and
if
it
has
not
its
seat
in
the
will
in
the
case
of
goldwin
smith
it
is
of
the
curable
and
harmless
kind
the
fairness
of
his
intention
is
far
beyond
his
knowledge
when
he
is
unjust
it
is
not
from
hatred
where
he
is
impartial
it
is
not
always
from
the
copiousness
of
his
information
his
prejudices
are
of
a
nature
which
his
ability
and
honesty
will
in
time
inevitably
overcome
the
general
result
and
moral
of
his
book
is
excellent
he
shows
that
the
has
been
from
the
beginning
the
great
difficulty
in
ireland
and
he
concludes
with
a
condemnation
of
the
established
church
and
a
prophecy
of
its
approaching
fall
the
weakness
of
ireland
and
the
guilt
of
england
are
not
disguised
and
the
author
has
not
written
to
stimulate
the
anger
of
one
nation
or
to
attenuate
the
remorse
of
the
other
to
both
he
gives
wise
and
advice
that
may
soon
be
very
opportune
the
first
american
war
was
the
commencement
of
the
deliverance
of
ireland
and
it
may
be
that
a
new
american
war
will
complete
the
work
of
regeneration
which
the
first
began
agreeing
as
we
do
with
the
policy
of
the
author
and
admiring
the
spirit
of
his
book
we
shall
not
attempt
either
to
enforce
or
to
dispute
his
conclusions
and
we
shall
confine
our
remarks
to
less
essential
points
on
which
he
appears
to
us
in
the
wrong
there
are
several
instances
of
inaccuracy
and
negligence
which
however
trivial
in
themselves
tend
to
prove
that
the
author
is
not
always
very
scrupulous
in
speaking
of
things
he
has
not
studied
a
purist
so
severe
as
to
write
kelt
for
celt
ought
not
to
call
mercury
originally
a
very
different
personage
from
hermes
one
of
the
legendary
authors
of
greek
civilisation
and
we
do
not
believe
that
anybody
who
had
read
the
writings
of
the
two
primates
could
call
bramhall
an
inferior
counterpart
of
laud
in
a
loftier
mood
and
therefore
apparently
with
still
greater
license
goldwin
smith
declares
that
the
glorious
blood
of
orange
could
scarcely
have
run
in
a
low
persecutor
veins
the
blood
of
orange
ran
in
the
veins
of
william
the
silent
the
threefold
hypocrite
who
confessed
catholicism
whilst
he
hoped
to
retain
his
influence
at
court
lutheranism
when
there
was
a
chance
of
obtaining
assistance
from
the
german
princes
calvinism
when
he
was
forced
to
resort
to
religion
in
order
to
excite
the
people
against
the
crown
and
who
persecuted
the
protestants
in
orange
and
the
catholics
in
holland
these
however
are
matters
of
no
consequence
whatever
in
a
political
history
of
ireland
but
we
find
ourselves
at
issue
with
the
author
on
the
important
question
of
political
freedom
even
the
highly
civilised
kelt
of
france
familiar
as
he
is
with
theories
of
political
liberty
seems
almost
incapable
of
sustaining
free
institutions
after
a
moment
of
constitutional
government
he
reverts
with
a
bias
which
the
fatalist
might
call
irresistible
to
despotism
in
some
form
the
warning
so
frequently
uttered
by
burke
in
his
last
years
to
fly
from
the
liberty
of
france
is
still
more
needful
now
that
french
liberty
has
exhibited
itself
in
a
far
more
seductive
light
the
danger
is
more
subtle
when
able
men
confound
political
forms
with
popular
rights
france
has
never
been
governed
by
a
constitution
since
if
by
a
constitution
is
meant
a
definite
rule
and
limitation
of
the
governing
power
it
is
not
that
the
french
failed
to
preserve
the
forms
of
parliamentary
government
but
that
those
forms
no
more
implied
freedom
than
the
glory
which
the
empire
has
twice
given
in
their
stead
it
is
a
serious
fault
in
our
author
that
he
has
not
understood
so
essential
a
distinction
has
he
not
read
the
of
by
tom
paine
it
is
not
because
a
part
of
the
government
is
elective
that
makes
it
less
a
despotism
if
the
persons
so
elected
possess
afterwards
as
a
parliament
unlimited
powers
election
in
this
case
becomes
separated
from
representation
and
the
candidates
are
candidates
for
despotism
napoleon
once
consulted
the
cleverest
among
the
politicians
who
served
him
respecting
the
durability
of
some
of
his
institutions
ask
yourself
was
the
answer
what
it
would
cost
you
to
destroy
them
if
the
destruction
would
cost
no
effort
you
have
created
nothing
for
politically
as
well
as
physically
only
that
which
resists
endures
in
the
year
the
same
great
writer
said
nothing
is
more
pernicious
in
a
monarchy
than
the
principles
and
the
forms
of
democracy
for
they
allow
no
alternative
but
despotism
and
revolutions
with
the
additional
experience
of
half
a
century
a
writer
not
inferior
to
the
last
repeats
exactly
the
same
idea
of
all
societies
in
the
world
those
which
will
always
have
most
difficulty
in
permanently
escaping
absolute
government
will
be
precisely
those
societies
in
which
aristocracy
is
no
more
and
can
no
more
be
french
constitutionalism
was
but
a
form
by
which
the
absence
of
was
concealed
the
state
was
as
despotic
under
villèle
or
guizot
as
under
either
of
the
bonapartes
the
restoration
fenced
itself
round
with
artificial
creations
having
no
root
in
the
condition
or
in
the
sympathies
of
the
people
these
creations
simply
weakened
it
by
making
it
unpopular
the
hereditary
peerage
was
an
anomaly
in
a
country
unused
to
primogeniture
and
so
was
the
revival
in
a
nation
of
sceptics
of
the
gallican
union
between
church
and
state
the
monarchy
of
july
which
was
more
suited
to
the
nature
of
french
society
and
was
thus
enabled
to
crush
a
series
of
insurrections
was
at
last
forced
by
its
position
and
by
the
necessity
of
to
assume
a
very
despotic
character
after
the
fortifications
of
paris
were
begun
a
tendency
set
in
which
under
a
younger
sovereign
would
have
led
to
a
system
hardly
distinguishable
from
that
which
now
prevails
and
there
are
princes
in
the
house
of
orleans
whose
government
would
develop
the
principle
of
democracy
in
a
manner
not
very
remote
from
the
institutions
of
the
second
empire
it
is
liberalism
more
than
despotism
that
is
opposed
to
liberty
in
france
and
it
is
a
most
dangerous
error
to
imagine
that
the
governments
of
the
french
charter
really
resemble
ours
there
are
states
without
any
parliament
at
all
whose
principles
and
fundamental
institutions
are
in
much
closer
harmony
with
our
system
of
autonomy
goldwin
smith
sees
half
the
truth
that
there
is
something
in
the
french
nation
which
incapacitates
it
for
liberty
but
he
does
not
see
that
what
they
have
always
sought
and
sometimes
enjoyed
is
not
freedom
that
their
liberty
must
diminish
in
proportion
as
their
ideal
is
attained
and
that
they
are
not
yet
familiar
with
the
theory
of
political
rights
with
this
false
notion
of
what
constitutes
liberty
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
should
repeatedly
dwell
on
its
connection
with
protestantism
and
talk
of
the
political
liberty
which
protestantism
brought
in
its
train
such
phrases
may
console
a
protestant
reader
of
a
book
fatal
to
the
protestant
ascendency
in
ireland
but
as
there
are
no
arguments
in
support
of
them
and
as
they
are
strangely
contradicted
by
the
facts
in
the
context
goldwin
smith
resorts
to
the
ingenious
artifice
of
calling
to
mind
as
many
ugly
stories
about
catholics
as
he
can
the
notion
constantly
recurs
that
though
the
protestants
were
very
wicked
in
ireland
it
was
against
their
principles
and
general
practice
and
is
due
to
the
catholics
whose
system
naturally
led
them
to
be
tyrannical
and
cruel
and
thus
provoked
retaliation
smith
might
have
been
reminded
by
peter
plymley
that
when
protestantism
has
had
its
own
way
it
has
uniformly
been
averse
to
freedom
what
has
protestantism
done
for
liberty
in
denmark
in
sweden
throughout
the
north
of
germany
and
in
prussia
not
much
less
than
democracy
has
done
in
france
an
admirer
of
the
constitutions
of
or
may
be
excused
if
he
is
not
very
severe
on
the
absolutism
of
protestant
countries
goldwin
smith
mistakes
the
character
of
the
invasion
of
ireland
because
he
has
not
understood
the
relative
position
of
the
civilisation
of
the
two
countries
at
the
time
when
it
occurred
that
of
the
celts
was
in
many
respects
more
refined
than
that
of
the
normans
the
celts
are
not
among
the
progressive
initiative
races
but
among
those
which
supply
the
materials
rather
than
the
impulse
of
history
and
are
either
stationary
or
retrogressive
the
persians
the
greeks
the
romans
and
the
teutons
are
the
only
makers
of
history
the
only
authors
of
advancement
other
races
possessing
a
highly
developed
language
a
copious
literature
a
speculative
religion
enjoying
luxury
and
art
attain
to
a
certain
pitch
of
cultivation
which
they
are
unable
either
to
communicate
or
to
increase
they
are
a
negative
element
in
the
world
sometimes
the
barrier
sometimes
the
instrument
sometimes
the
material
of
those
races
to
whom
it
is
given
to
originate
and
to
advance
their
existence
is
either
passive
or
reactionary
and
destructive
when
after
intervening
like
the
blind
forces
of
nature
they
speedily
exhibit
their
uncreative
character
and
leave
others
to
pursue
the
course
to
which
they
have
pointed
the
chinese
are
a
people
of
this
kind
they
have
long
remained
stationary
and
succeeded
in
excluding
the
influences
of
general
history
so
the
hindoos
being
pantheists
they
have
no
history
of
their
own
but
supply
objects
for
commerce
and
for
conquest
so
the
huns
whose
appearance
gave
a
sudden
impetus
to
a
stagnant
world
so
the
slavonians
who
tell
only
in
the
mass
and
whose
influence
is
ascertainable
sometimes
by
adding
to
the
momentum
of
active
forces
sometimes
by
impeding
through
inertness
the
progress
of
mankind
to
this
class
of
nations
also
belong
the
celts
of
gaul
the
roman
and
the
german
conquerors
have
not
altered
their
character
as
it
was
drawn
two
thousand
years
ago
they
have
a
history
but
it
is
not
theirs
their
nature
remains
unchanged
their
history
is
the
history
of
the
invaders
the
revolution
was
the
revival
of
the
conquered
race
and
their
reaction
against
the
creations
of
their
masters
but
it
has
been
cunning
only
to
destroy
it
has
not
given
life
to
one
constructive
idea
or
durability
to
one
new
institution
and
it
has
exhibited
to
the
world
an
unparalleled
political
incapacity
which
was
announced
by
burke
and
analysed
by
tocqueville
in
works
which
are
the
crowning
pieces
of
two
great
literatures
the
celts
of
these
islands
in
like
manner
waited
for
a
foreign
influence
to
set
in
action
the
rich
treasure
which
in
their
own
hands
could
be
of
no
avail
their
language
was
more
flexible
their
poetry
and
music
more
copious
than
those
of
the
their
laws
if
we
may
judge
from
those
of
wales
display
a
society
in
some
respects
highly
cultivated
but
like
the
rest
of
that
group
of
nations
to
which
they
belong
there
was
not
in
them
the
incentive
to
action
and
progress
which
is
given
by
the
consciousness
of
a
part
in
human
destiny
by
the
inspiration
of
a
high
idea
or
even
by
the
natural
development
of
institutions
their
life
and
literature
were
aimless
and
wasteful
without
combination
or
concentration
they
had
no
star
to
guide
them
in
an
onward
course
and
the
progress
of
dawn
into
day
was
no
more
to
them
than
to
the
flocks
and
to
the
forests
before
the
danish
wars
and
the
decay
which
is
described
by
bernard
in
terms
which
must
not
be
taken
quite
literally
had
led
to
the
english
invasion
there
was
probably
as
much
material
certainly
as
much
spiritual
culture
in
ireland
as
in
any
country
in
the
west
but
there
was
not
that
by
whose
sustaining
force
alone
these
things
endure
by
which
alone
the
place
of
nations
in
history
is
determined
there
was
no
political
civilisation
the
state
did
not
keep
pace
with
the
progress
of
society
this
is
the
essential
and
decisive
inferiority
of
the
celtic
race
as
conspicuous
among
the
irish
in
the
twelfth
century
as
among
the
french
in
our
own
they
gave
way
before
the
higher
political
aptitude
of
the
english
the
issue
of
an
invasion
is
generally
decided
by
this
political
aptitude
and
the
consequences
of
conquest
always
depend
on
it
subjection
to
a
people
of
a
higher
capacity
for
government
is
of
itself
no
misfortune
and
it
is
to
most
countries
the
condition
of
their
political
advancement
the
greeks
were
more
highly
cultivated
than
the
romans
the
gauls
than
the
franks
yet
in
both
cases
the
higher
political
intelligence
prevailed
for
a
long
time
the
english
had
perhaps
no
other
superiority
over
the
irish
yet
this
alone
would
have
made
the
conquest
a
great
blessing
to
ireland
but
for
the
separation
of
the
races
conquering
races
necessarily
bring
with
them
their
own
system
of
government
and
there
is
no
other
way
of
introducing
it
a
nation
can
obtain
political
education
only
by
dependence
on
another
art
literature
and
science
may
be
communicated
by
the
conquered
to
the
conqueror
but
government
can
be
taught
only
by
governing
therefore
only
by
the
governors
politics
can
only
be
learnt
in
this
school
the
most
uncivilised
of
the
barbarians
whilst
they
slowly
and
imperfectly
learned
the
arts
of
rome
at
once
remodelled
its
laws
the
two
kinds
of
civilisation
social
and
political
are
wholly
unconnected
with
each
other
either
may
subsist
in
high
perfection
alone
polity
grows
like
language
and
is
part
of
a
people
nature
not
dependent
on
its
will
one
or
the
other
can
be
developed
modified
corrected
but
they
can
not
be
subverted
or
changed
by
the
people
itself
without
an
act
of
suicide
organic
change
if
it
comes
at
all
must
come
from
abroad
revolution
is
a
malady
a
frenzy
an
interruption
of
the
nation
growth
sometimes
fatal
to
its
existence
often
to
its
independence
in
this
case
revolution
by
making
the
nation
subject
to
others
may
be
the
occasion
of
a
new
development
but
it
is
not
conceivable
that
a
nation
should
arbitrarily
and
spontaneously
cast
off
its
history
reject
its
traditions
abrogate
its
law
and
government
and
commence
a
new
political
existence
nothing
in
the
experience
of
ages
or
in
the
nature
of
man
allows
us
to
believe
that
the
attempt
of
france
to
establish
a
durable
edifice
on
the
ruins
of
without
using
the
old
materials
can
ever
succeed
or
that
she
can
ever
emerge
from
the
vicious
circle
of
the
last
seventy
years
except
by
returning
to
the
principle
which
she
then
repudiated
and
by
admitting
that
if
states
would
live
they
must
preserve
their
organic
connection
with
their
origin
and
history
which
are
their
root
and
their
stem
that
they
are
not
voluntary
creations
of
human
wisdom
and
that
men
labour
in
vain
who
would
construct
them
without
acknowledging
god
as
the
artificer
theorists
who
hold
it
to
be
a
wrong
that
a
nation
should
belong
to
a
foreign
state
are
therefore
in
contradiction
with
the
law
of
civil
progress
this
law
or
rather
necessity
which
is
as
absolute
as
the
law
that
binds
society
together
is
the
force
which
makes
us
need
one
another
and
only
enables
us
to
obtain
what
we
need
on
terms
not
of
equality
but
of
dominion
and
subjection
in
domestic
economic
or
political
relations
the
political
theory
of
nationality
is
in
contradiction
with
the
historic
nation
since
a
nation
derives
its
ideas
and
instincts
of
government
as
much
as
its
temperament
and
its
language
from
god
acting
through
the
influences
of
nature
and
of
history
these
ideas
and
instincts
are
originally
and
essentially
peculiar
to
it
and
not
separable
from
it
they
have
no
practical
value
in
themselves
when
divided
from
the
capacity
which
corresponds
to
them
national
qualities
are
the
incarnations
of
political
ideas
no
people
can
receive
its
government
from
another
without
receiving
at
the
same
time
the
ministers
of
government
the
workman
must
travel
with
the
work
such
changes
can
only
be
accomplished
by
submission
to
a
foreign
state
or
to
another
race
europe
has
seen
two
great
instances
of
such
conquests
extending
over
centuries
the
roman
empire
and
the
settlement
of
the
barbarians
in
the
west
this
it
is
which
gives
unity
to
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
the
romans
established
a
universal
empire
by
subjecting
all
countries
to
the
authority
of
a
single
power
the
barbarians
introduced
into
all
a
single
system
of
law
and
thus
became
the
instrument
of
a
universal
church
the
same
spirit
of
freedom
the
same
notions
of
the
state
pervade
all
the
and
all
the
polities
they
founded
in
europe
and
asia
they
differ
widely
in
the
surrounding
conditions
in
the
state
of
society
in
the
degree
of
advancement
in
almost
all
external
things
the
principle
common
to
them
all
is
to
acknowledge
the
freedom
of
the
church
as
a
corporation
and
a
proprietor
and
in
virtue
of
the
principle
of
to
allow
religion
to
develop
her
influence
in
the
state
the
great
migration
which
terminated
in
the
norman
conquests
and
in
the
crusades
gave
the
dominion
of
the
latin
world
to
the
teutonic
chivalry
and
to
the
church
her
proper
place
all
other
countries
sank
into
despotism
into
schism
and
at
last
into
barbarism
under
the
tartars
or
the
turks
the
union
between
the
teutonic
races
and
the
holy
see
was
founded
on
their
political
qualities
more
than
on
their
religious
fervour
in
modern
times
the
most
pious
catholics
have
often
tyrannised
over
the
church
in
the
middle
ages
her
liberty
was
often
secured
and
respected
where
her
spiritual
injunctions
were
least
obeyed
the
growth
of
the
feudal
system
coinciding
with
the
general
decay
of
morals
led
in
the
eleventh
century
to
new
efforts
of
the
church
to
preserve
her
freedom
the
holy
see
was
delivered
from
the
roman
factions
by
the
most
illustrious
of
the
emperors
and
a
series
of
german
popes
commenced
the
great
reform
other
princes
were
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
imperial
nominees
and
the
kings
of
france
and
castile
showed
symptoms
of
resistance
in
which
they
were
supported
by
the
heresy
of
berengarius
the
conduct
of
henry
iv
delivered
the
church
from
the
patronage
of
the
empire
whilst
the
normans
defended
her
against
the
gallican
tendencies
and
the
feudal
tyranny
in
sicily
the
normans
consented
to
hold
their
power
from
the
pope
and
in
normandy
berengarius
found
a
successful
adversary
and
the
king
of
france
a
vassal
who
compelled
him
to
abandon
his
designs
the
chaplain
of
the
conqueror
describes
his
government
in
terms
which
show
how
singularly
it
fulfilled
the
conditions
which
the
church
requires
he
tells
us
that
william
established
in
normandy
a
truly
christian
order
that
every
village
town
and
castle
enjoyed
its
own
privileges
and
that
while
other
princes
either
forbade
the
erection
of
churches
or
seized
their
endowments
he
left
his
subjects
free
to
make
pious
gifts
in
his
reign
and
by
his
conduct
the
word
bigot
ceased
to
be
a
term
of
reproach
and
came
to
signify
what
we
now
should
call
ultramontane
he
was
the
foremost
of
those
normans
who
were
called
by
the
holy
see
to
reclaim
what
was
degenerate
and
to
renovate
the
declining
states
of
the
north
where
the
church
addressed
herself
to
the
conversion
of
races
of
purely
teutonic
origin
as
in
scandinavia
her
missionaries
achieved
the
work
in
other
countries
as
in
poland
and
hungary
political
dependence
on
the
empire
was
the
channel
and
safeguard
of
her
influence
the
norman
conquest
of
england
and
of
ireland
differs
from
all
of
these
in
both
islands
the
faith
had
been
freely
preached
adopted
and
preserved
the
rulers
and
the
people
were
catholic
the
last
saxon
king
who
died
before
the
conquest
was
a
saint
the
last
archbishop
of
dublin
appointed
before
the
invasion
was
a
saint
neither
of
the
invasions
can
be
explained
simply
by
the
demoralisation
of
the
clergy
or
by
the
spiritual
destitution
of
the
people
catholicism
spreads
among
the
nations
not
only
as
a
doctrine
but
as
an
institution
the
church
says
goldwin
smith
is
not
a
disembodied
spirit
but
a
spirit
embodied
in
human
society
her
teaching
is
directed
to
the
inner
man
and
is
confined
to
the
social
order
but
her
discipline
touches
on
the
political
she
can
not
permanently
ignore
the
acts
and
character
of
the
state
or
escape
its
notice
whilst
she
preaches
submission
to
authorities
ordained
by
god
her
nature
not
her
interest
compels
her
to
exert
an
involuntary
influence
upon
them
the
jealousy
so
often
exhibited
by
governments
is
not
without
reason
for
the
free
action
of
the
church
is
the
test
of
the
free
constitution
of
the
state
and
without
such
free
constitution
there
must
necessarily
ensue
either
persecution
or
revolution
between
the
settled
organisation
of
catholicism
and
every
form
of
arbitrary
power
there
is
an
incompatibility
which
must
terminate
in
conflict
in
a
state
which
possesses
no
security
for
authority
or
freedom
the
church
must
either
fight
or
succumb
now
as
authority
and
freedom
the
conditions
of
her
existence
can
only
be
obtained
through
the
instrumentality
of
certain
nations
she
depends
on
the
aid
of
these
nations
religion
alone
can
not
civilise
men
or
secure
its
own
conquest
it
promotes
civilisation
where
it
has
power
but
it
has
not
power
where
its
way
is
not
prepared
its
civilising
influence
is
chiefly
indirect
and
acts
by
its
needs
and
wants
as
much
as
by
the
fulness
of
its
ideas
so
christianity
extends
itself
by
the
aid
of
the
secular
power
relying
not
on
the
victories
of
christian
arms
but
on
the
progress
of
institutions
and
ideas
that
harmonise
with
ecclesiastical
freedom
hence
those
who
have
most
actively
served
the
interests
of
the
church
are
not
always
those
who
have
been
most
faithful
to
her
doctrines
the
work
which
the
goth
and
the
frank
had
done
on
the
continent
of
europe
the
normans
came
to
do
in
england
where
it
had
been
done
before
but
had
failed
and
in
ireland
where
neither
roman
nor
german
influences
had
entered
thus
the
theory
of
nationality
unknown
to
catholic
ages
is
inconsistent
both
with
political
reason
and
with
christianity
which
requires
the
dominion
of
race
over
race
and
whose
path
was
made
straight
by
two
universal
empires
the
missionary
may
outstrip
in
his
devoted
zeal
the
progress
of
trade
or
of
arms
but
the
seed
that
he
plants
will
not
take
root
unprotected
by
those
ideas
of
right
and
duty
which
first
came
into
the
world
with
the
tribes
who
destroyed
the
civilisation
of
antiquity
and
whose
descendants
are
in
our
day
carrying
those
ideas
to
every
quarter
of
the
world
it
was
as
impossible
to
realise
in
ireland
the
mediæval
notions
of
ecclesiastical
liberty
without
a
great
political
reform
as
to
put
an
end
to
the
dissolution
of
society
and
the
feuds
of
princes
without
the
authority
of
a
supreme
lord
there
is
one
institution
of
those
days
to
which
goldwin
smith
has
not
done
entire
justice
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
eric
or
pecuniary
composition
for
blood
in
place
of
capital
or
other
punishment
which
the
brehon
law
sanctioned
is
the
reproach
of
all
primitive
codes
and
of
none
it
is
the
first
step
from
the
license
of
savage
revenge
to
the
ordered
justice
of
a
regular
law
pecuniary
composition
for
blood
belongs
to
an
advanced
period
of
defined
and
regular
criminal
jurisprudence
in
the
lowest
form
of
civil
society
when
the
state
is
not
yet
distinct
from
the
family
the
family
is
compelled
to
defend
itself
and
the
only
protection
of
society
is
the
vendetta
it
is
the
private
right
of
combined
with
the
public
office
of
punishment
and
therefore
not
only
a
privilege
but
an
obligation
the
whole
family
is
bound
to
avenge
the
injury
but
the
duty
rests
first
of
all
with
the
heir
precedency
in
the
office
of
avenger
is
naturally
connected
with
a
first
claim
in
inheritance
and
the
succession
to
property
is
determined
by
the
law
of
revenge
this
leads
both
to
primogeniture
because
the
eldest
son
is
most
likely
to
be
capable
of
punishing
the
culprit
and
for
the
same
reason
to
modifications
of
primogeniture
by
the
preference
of
the
brother
before
the
grandson
and
of
the
male
line
before
the
female
a
practice
which
appears
barbarous
is
therefore
one
of
the
foundations
of
civilisation
and
the
origin
of
some
of
the
refinements
of
law
in
this
state
of
society
there
is
no
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal
law
an
injury
is
looked
upon
as
a
private
wrong
not
as
religion
considers
it
a
sin
or
as
the
state
considers
it
a
crime
something
very
similar
occurs
in
feudal
society
here
all
the
barons
were
virtually
equal
to
each
other
and
without
any
superior
to
punish
their
crimes
or
to
avenge
their
wrongs
they
were
therefore
compelled
to
obtain
safety
or
reparation
like
sovereigns
by
force
of
arms
what
war
is
among
states
the
feud
is
in
feudal
society
and
the
vengeance
of
blood
in
societies
not
yet
matured
into
states
a
substitute
for
the
fixed
administration
of
justice
the
assumption
of
this
duty
by
the
state
begins
with
the
recognisance
of
acts
done
against
the
state
itself
at
first
political
crimes
alone
are
visited
with
a
public
penalty
private
injuries
demand
no
public
expiation
but
only
satisfaction
of
the
injured
party
this
appears
in
its
most
rudimentary
form
in
the
society
requires
that
punishment
should
be
inflicted
by
the
state
in
order
to
prevent
continual
disorders
if
the
injured
party
could
be
satisfied
and
his
duty
fulfilled
without
inflicting
on
the
criminal
an
injury
corresponding
to
that
which
he
had
done
society
was
obviously
the
gainer
at
first
it
was
optional
to
accept
or
to
refuse
satisfaction
afterwards
it
was
made
obligatory
where
property
was
so
valuable
that
its
loss
was
visited
on
the
life
or
limb
of
the
robber
and
injuries
against
property
were
made
a
question
of
life
and
death
it
soon
followed
that
injury
to
life
could
be
made
a
question
of
payment
to
expiate
robbery
by
death
and
to
expiate
murder
by
the
payment
of
a
fine
are
correlative
ideas
practically
this
custom
often
told
with
a
barbarous
inequality
against
those
who
were
too
poor
to
purchase
forgiveness
but
it
was
otherwise
both
just
and
humane
in
principle
and
it
was
generally
encouraged
by
the
church
for
in
her
eyes
the
criminal
was
guilty
of
an
act
of
which
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
repent
this
made
her
desire
not
his
destruction
but
his
conversion
she
tried
therefore
to
save
his
life
and
to
put
an
end
to
revenge
mutilation
and
servitude
and
for
all
this
the
alternative
was
compensation
this
purpose
was
served
by
the
right
of
asylum
the
church
surrendered
the
fugitive
only
on
condition
that
his
life
and
person
should
be
spared
in
consideration
of
a
lawful
fine
which
she
often
paid
for
him
herself
concedatur
ei
vita
et
omnia
membra
emendat
autem
causam
in
quantum
potuerit
says
a
law
of
charlemagne
given
in
the
year
when
the
influence
of
religion
on
legislation
was
most
powerful
in
europe
no
idea
occurs
more
frequently
in
the
work
we
are
reviewing
than
that
of
the
persecuting
character
of
the
catholic
church
it
is
used
as
a
perpetual
apology
for
the
penal
laws
in
ireland
when
the
catholics
writhe
under
this
wrong
let
them
turn
their
eyes
to
the
history
of
catholic
countries
and
remember
that
while
the
catholic
church
was
stripped
of
her
endowments
and
doomed
to
political
degradation
by
protestant
persecutors
in
ireland
the
protestant
churches
were
exterminated
with
fire
and
sword
by
catholic
persecutors
in
france
austria
flanders
italy
and
spain
he
speaks
of
catholicism
as
a
religion
which
all
protestants
believed
to
be
idolatrous
and
knew
by
fearful
experience
to
be
persecuting
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
point
to
persecuting
laws
more
sanguinary
than
these
spain
france
and
austria
will
at
once
supply
signal
examples
that
persecution
was
the
vice
of
an
age
and
not
only
of
a
particular
religion
that
it
disgraced
protestantism
as
well
as
catholicism
is
true
but
no
one
who
reads
the
religious
history
of
europe
with
an
open
mind
can
fail
to
perceive
that
the
persecutions
carried
on
by
protestants
were
far
less
bloody
and
less
extensive
than
those
carried
on
by
catholics
that
they
were
more
frequently
excusable
as
acts
of
retaliation
that
they
arose
more
from
political
alarm
and
less
from
the
spirit
of
the
religion
and
that
the
temper
of
their
authors
yielded
more
rapidly
to
the
advancing
influence
of
humanity
and
civilisation
pp
all
these
arguments
are
fallacies
but
as
the
statements
at
the
same
time
are
full
of
error
we
believe
that
the
author
is
wrong
because
he
has
not
studied
the
question
not
because
he
has
designed
to
misrepresent
it
the
fact
that
he
does
not
distinguish
from
each
other
the
various
kinds
and
occasions
of
persecution
proves
that
he
is
wholly
ignorant
of
the
things
with
which
it
is
connected
persecution
is
the
vice
of
particular
religions
and
the
misfortune
of
particular
stages
of
political
society
it
is
the
resource
by
which
states
that
would
be
subverted
by
religious
liberty
escape
the
more
dangerous
alternative
of
imposing
religious
disabilities
the
exclusion
of
a
part
of
the
community
by
reason
of
its
faith
from
the
full
benefit
of
the
law
is
a
danger
and
disadvantage
to
every
state
however
highly
organised
its
constitution
may
otherwise
be
but
the
actual
existence
of
a
religious
party
differing
in
faith
from
the
majority
is
dangerous
only
to
a
state
very
imperfectly
organised
disabilities
are
always
a
danger
multiplicity
of
religions
is
only
dangerous
to
states
of
an
inferior
type
by
persecution
they
rid
themselves
of
the
peculiar
danger
which
threatens
them
without
involving
themselves
in
a
system
universally
bad
persecution
comes
naturally
in
a
certain
period
of
the
progress
of
society
before
a
more
flexible
and
comprehensive
system
has
been
introduced
by
that
advance
of
religion
and
civilisation
whereby
catholicism
gradually
penetrates
into
hostile
countries
and
christian
powers
acquire
dominion
over
infidel
populations
thus
it
is
the
token
of
an
epoch
in
the
political
religious
and
intellectual
life
of
mankind
and
it
disappears
with
its
epoch
and
with
the
advance
of
the
church
militant
in
her
catholic
vocation
intolerance
of
dissent
and
impatience
of
contradiction
are
a
characteristic
of
youth
those
that
have
no
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
underlies
opposite
opinions
and
no
experience
of
their
consequent
force
can
not
believe
that
men
are
sincere
in
holding
them
at
a
certain
point
of
mental
growth
tolerance
implies
indifference
and
intolerance
is
inseparable
from
sincerity
thus
intolerance
in
itself
a
defect
becomes
in
this
case
a
merit
again
although
the
political
conditions
of
intolerance
belong
to
the
youth
and
immaturity
of
nations
the
motives
of
intolerance
may
at
any
time
be
just
and
the
principle
high
for
the
theory
of
religious
unity
is
founded
on
the
most
elevated
and
truest
view
of
the
character
and
function
of
the
state
on
the
perception
that
its
ultimate
purpose
is
not
distinct
from
that
of
the
church
in
the
pagan
state
they
were
identified
in
the
christian
world
the
end
remains
the
same
but
the
means
are
different
the
state
aims
at
the
things
of
another
life
but
indirectly
its
course
runs
parallel
to
that
of
the
church
they
do
not
converge
the
direct
subservience
of
the
state
to
religious
ends
would
imply
despotism
and
persecution
just
as
much
as
the
pagan
supremacy
of
civil
over
religious
authority
the
similarity
of
the
end
demands
harmony
in
the
principles
and
creates
a
decided
antagonism
between
the
state
and
a
religious
community
whose
character
is
in
total
contradiction
with
it
with
such
religions
there
is
no
possibility
of
reconciliation
a
state
must
be
at
open
war
with
any
system
which
it
sees
would
prevent
it
from
fulfilling
its
legitimate
duties
the
danger
therefore
lies
not
in
the
doctrine
but
in
the
practice
but
to
the
pagan
and
to
the
mediæval
state
the
danger
was
in
the
doctrine
the
christians
were
the
best
subjects
of
the
emperor
but
christianity
was
really
subversive
of
the
fundamental
institutions
of
the
roman
empire
in
the
infancy
of
the
modern
states
the
civil
power
required
all
the
help
that
religion
could
give
in
order
to
establish
itself
against
the
lawlessness
of
barbarism
and
feudal
dissolution
the
existence
of
the
state
at
that
time
depended
on
the
power
of
the
church
when
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
empire
renounced
this
support
and
made
war
on
the
church
it
fell
at
once
into
a
number
of
small
sovereignties
in
those
cases
persecution
was
it
was
wrongly
defended
as
an
absolute
not
as
a
conditional
principle
but
such
a
principle
was
false
only
as
the
modern
theory
of
religious
liberty
is
false
one
was
a
wrong
generalisation
from
the
true
character
of
the
state
the
other
is
a
true
conclusion
from
a
false
notion
of
the
state
to
say
that
because
of
the
union
between
church
and
state
it
is
right
to
persecute
would
condemn
all
toleration
and
to
say
that
the
objects
of
the
state
have
nothing
to
do
with
religion
would
condemn
all
persecution
but
persecution
and
toleration
are
equally
true
in
principle
considered
politically
only
one
belongs
to
a
more
highly
developed
civilisation
than
the
other
at
one
period
toleration
would
destroy
society
at
another
persecution
is
fatal
to
liberty
the
theory
of
intolerance
is
wrong
only
if
founded
absolutely
upon
religious
motives
but
even
then
the
practice
of
it
is
not
necessarily
censurable
it
is
opposed
to
the
christian
spirit
in
the
same
manner
as
slavery
is
opposed
to
it
the
church
prohibits
neither
intolerance
nor
slavery
though
in
proportion
as
her
influence
extends
and
civilisation
advances
both
gradually
disappear
unity
and
liberty
are
the
only
legitimate
principles
on
which
the
position
of
a
church
in
a
state
can
be
regulated
but
the
distance
between
them
is
immeasurable
and
the
transition
extremely
difficult
to
pass
from
religious
unity
to
religious
liberty
is
to
effect
a
complete
inversion
in
the
character
of
the
state
a
change
in
the
whole
spirit
of
legislation
and
a
still
greater
revolution
in
the
minds
and
habits
of
men
so
great
a
change
seldom
happens
all
at
once
the
law
naturally
follows
the
condition
of
society
which
does
not
suddenly
change
an
intervening
stage
from
unity
to
liberty
a
compromise
between
toleration
and
persecution
is
a
common
but
irrational
tyrannical
and
impolitic
arrangement
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
the
guilt
of
persecution
if
we
do
not
distinguish
the
various
principles
on
which
religious
dissent
can
be
treated
by
the
state
the
exclusion
of
other
religions
the
system
of
spain
of
sweden
of
mecklenburg
holstein
and
tyrol
is
reasonable
in
principle
though
practically
untenable
in
the
present
state
of
european
society
the
system
of
expulsion
or
compulsory
conformity
adopted
by
lewis
xiv
and
the
emperor
nicholas
is
defensible
neither
on
religious
nor
political
grounds
but
the
system
applied
to
ireland
which
uses
religious
disabilities
for
the
purpose
of
political
oppression
stands
alone
in
solitary
infamy
among
the
crimes
and
follies
of
the
rulers
of
men
the
acquisition
of
real
definite
freedom
is
a
very
slow
and
tardy
process
the
great
social
independence
enjoyed
in
the
early
periods
of
national
history
is
not
yet
political
freedom
the
state
has
not
yet
developed
its
authority
or
assumed
the
functions
of
government
a
period
follows
when
all
the
action
of
society
is
absorbed
by
the
ruling
power
when
the
license
of
early
times
is
gone
and
the
liberties
of
a
riper
age
are
not
yet
acquired
these
liberties
are
the
product
of
a
long
conflict
with
absolutism
and
of
a
gradual
development
which
by
establishing
definite
rights
revives
in
positive
form
the
negative
liberty
of
an
unformed
society
the
object
and
the
result
of
this
process
is
the
organisation
of
the
substitution
of
right
for
force
of
authority
for
power
of
duty
for
necessity
and
of
a
moral
for
a
physical
relation
between
government
and
people
until
this
point
is
reached
religious
liberty
is
an
anomaly
in
a
state
which
possesses
all
power
and
all
authority
there
is
no
room
for
the
autonomy
of
religious
communities
those
states
therefore
not
only
refuse
liberty
of
conscience
but
deprive
the
favoured
church
of
ecclesiastical
freedom
the
principles
of
religious
unity
and
liberty
are
so
opposed
that
no
modern
state
has
at
once
denied
toleration
and
allowed
freedom
to
its
established
church
both
of
these
are
unnatural
in
a
state
which
rejects
the
only
secure
basis
of
all
freedom
whether
religious
or
political
for
religious
freedom
is
based
on
political
liberty
intolerance
therefore
is
a
political
necessity
against
all
religions
which
threaten
the
unity
of
faith
in
a
state
that
is
not
free
and
in
every
state
against
those
religions
which
threaten
its
existence
absolute
intolerance
belongs
to
the
absolute
state
special
persecution
may
be
justified
by
special
causes
in
any
state
all
mediæval
persecution
is
of
the
latter
kind
for
the
sects
against
which
it
was
directed
were
revolutionary
parties
the
state
really
defended
not
its
religious
unity
but
its
political
existence
if
the
catholic
church
was
naturally
inclined
to
persecute
she
would
persecute
in
all
cases
alike
when
there
was
no
interest
to
serve
but
her
own
instead
of
adapting
her
conduct
to
circumstances
and
accepting
theories
according
to
the
character
of
the
time
she
would
have
developed
a
consistent
theory
out
of
her
own
system
and
would
have
been
most
severe
when
she
was
most
free
from
external
influences
from
political
objects
or
from
temporary
or
national
prejudices
she
would
have
imposed
a
common
rule
of
conduct
in
different
countries
in
different
ages
instead
of
submitting
to
the
exigencies
of
each
time
and
place
her
own
rule
of
conduct
never
changed
she
treats
it
as
a
crime
to
abandon
her
not
to
be
outside
her
an
apostate
who
returns
to
her
has
a
penance
for
his
apostasy
a
heretic
who
is
converted
has
no
penance
for
his
heresy
severity
against
those
who
are
outside
her
fold
is
against
her
principles
persecution
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
a
universal
church
it
is
peculiar
to
the
national
churches
while
the
catholic
church
by
her
progress
in
freedom
naturally
tends
to
push
the
development
of
states
beyond
the
sphere
where
they
are
still
obliged
to
preserve
the
unity
of
religion
and
whilst
she
extends
over
states
in
all
degrees
of
advancement
protestantism
which
belongs
to
a
particular
age
and
state
of
society
which
makes
no
claim
to
universality
and
which
is
dependent
on
political
connection
regards
persecution
not
as
an
accident
but
as
a
duty
wherever
protestantism
prevailed
intolerance
became
a
principle
of
state
and
was
proclaimed
in
theory
even
where
the
protestants
were
in
a
minority
and
where
the
theory
supplied
a
weapon
against
themselves
the
reformation
made
it
a
general
law
not
only
against
catholics
by
way
of
or
retaliation
but
against
all
who
dissented
from
the
reformed
doctrines
whom
it
treated
not
as
enemies
but
as
criminals
against
the
protestant
sects
against
socinians
and
against
atheists
it
was
not
a
right
but
a
duty
its
object
was
to
avenge
god
not
to
preserve
order
there
is
no
analogy
between
the
persecution
which
preserves
and
the
persecution
which
attacks
or
between
intolerance
as
a
religious
duty
and
intolerance
as
a
necessity
of
state
the
reformers
unanimously
declared
persecution
to
be
incumbent
on
the
civil
power
and
the
protestant
governments
universally
acted
upon
their
injunctions
until
scepticism
escaped
the
infliction
of
penal
laws
and
condemned
their
spirit
doubtless
in
the
interest
of
their
religion
they
acted
wisely
freedom
is
not
more
decidedly
the
natural
condition
of
catholicism
than
intolerance
is
of
protestantism
which
by
the
help
of
persecution
succeeded
in
establishing
itself
in
countries
where
it
had
no
root
in
the
affections
of
the
people
and
in
preserving
itself
from
the
internal
divisions
which
follow
free
inquiry
toleration
has
been
at
once
a
cause
and
an
effect
of
its
decline
the
catholic
church
on
the
other
hand
supported
the
mediæval
state
by
religious
unity
and
has
saved
herself
in
the
modern
state
by
religious
freedom
no
longer
compelled
to
devise
theories
in
justification
of
a
system
imposed
on
her
by
the
exigencies
of
societies
she
is
enabled
to
revert
to
a
policy
more
suited
to
her
nature
and
to
her
most
venerable
traditions
and
the
principle
of
liberty
has
already
restored
to
her
much
of
that
which
the
principle
of
unity
took
away
it
was
not
as
our
author
imagines
by
the
protection
of
lewis
xiv
that
she
was
formidable
nor
is
it
true
that
in
consequence
of
the
loss
of
temporalities
the
chill
of
death
is
gathering
round
the
heart
of
the
great
theocracy
nor
that
the
visible
decline
of
the
papacy
is
at
hand
because
it
no
longer
wields
the
more
efficacious
arms
of
the
great
catholic
monarchies
the
same
appeal
to
force
the
same
principles
of
intolerance
which
expelled
catholicism
from
protestant
countries
gave
rise
in
catholic
countries
to
the
growth
of
infidelity
the
revolutions
of
in
france
and
of
in
italy
attest
the
danger
of
a
practice
which
requires
for
its
support
the
doctrines
of
another
religion
or
the
circumstances
of
a
different
age
not
till
the
church
had
lost
those
props
in
which
goldwin
smith
sees
the
secret
of
her
power
did
she
recover
her
elasticity
and
her
expansive
vigour
catholics
may
have
learnt
this
truth
late
but
protestants
it
appears
have
yet
to
learn
it
in
one
point
goldwin
smith
is
not
so
very
far
from
the
views
of
the
orange
party
he
thinks
indeed
that
the
church
is
no
longer
dangerous
and
would
not
therefore
have
catholics
maltreated
but
this
is
due
not
to
her
merits
but
to
her
weakness
popes
might
now
be
as
willing
as
ever
if
they
had
the
power
to
step
between
a
protestant
state
and
the
allegiance
of
its
subjects
smith
seems
to
think
that
the
popes
claim
the
same
authority
over
the
rulers
of
a
protestant
state
that
they
formerly
possessed
over
the
princes
of
catholic
countries
yet
this
political
power
of
the
holy
see
was
never
a
universal
right
of
jurisdiction
over
states
but
a
special
and
positive
right
which
it
is
as
absurd
to
censure
as
to
fear
or
to
regret
at
the
present
time
directly
it
extended
only
over
territories
which
were
held
by
feudal
tenure
of
the
pope
like
the
sicilian
monarchy
elsewhere
the
authority
was
indirect
not
political
but
religious
and
its
political
consequences
were
due
to
the
laws
of
the
land
the
catholic
countries
would
no
more
submit
to
a
king
not
of
their
communion
than
protestant
countries
england
for
instance
or
denmark
this
is
as
natural
and
inevitable
in
a
country
where
the
whole
population
is
of
one
religion
as
it
is
artificial
and
unjust
in
a
country
where
no
sort
of
religious
unity
prevails
and
where
such
a
law
might
compel
the
sovereign
to
be
of
the
religion
of
the
minority
at
any
rate
nobody
who
thinks
it
reasonable
that
any
prince
abandoning
the
established
church
should
forfeit
the
english
throne
can
complain
of
a
law
which
compelled
the
sovereign
to
be
of
the
religion
not
of
a
majority
but
of
the
whole
of
his
subjects
the
idea
of
the
pope
stepping
between
a
state
and
the
allegiance
of
its
subjects
is
a
mere
misapprehension
the
instrument
of
his
authority
is
the
law
and
the
law
resides
in
the
state
the
pope
could
intervene
therefore
only
between
the
state
and
the
occupant
of
the
throne
and
his
intervention
suspended
not
the
duty
of
obeying
but
the
right
of
governing
the
line
on
which
his
sentence
ran
separated
not
the
subjects
from
the
state
but
the
sovereign
from
the
other
authorities
it
was
addressed
to
the
nation
politically
organised
against
the
head
of
the
organism
not
to
the
mass
of
individual
subjects
against
the
constituted
authorities
that
such
a
power
was
inconsistent
with
the
modern
notion
of
sovereignty
is
true
but
it
is
also
true
that
this
notion
is
as
much
at
variance
with
the
nature
of
ecclesiastical
authority
as
with
civil
liberty
the
roman
maxim
legibus
could
not
be
admitted
by
the
church
and
an
absolute
prince
could
not
properly
be
invested
in
her
eyes
with
the
sanctity
of
authority
or
protected
by
the
duty
of
submission
a
moral
and
a
spiritual
authority
moves
and
lives
only
in
an
atmosphere
of
freedom
there
are
however
two
things
to
be
considered
in
explanation
of
the
error
into
which
our
author
and
so
many
others
have
fallen
law
follows
life
but
not
with
an
equal
pace
there
is
a
time
when
it
ceases
to
correspond
to
the
existing
order
of
things
and
meets
an
invincible
obstacle
in
a
new
society
the
exercise
of
the
mediæval
authority
of
the
popes
was
founded
on
the
religious
unity
of
the
state
and
had
no
basis
in
a
divided
community
it
was
not
easy
in
the
period
of
transition
to
tell
when
the
change
took
place
and
at
what
moment
the
old
power
lost
its
efficacy
no
one
could
foresee
its
failure
and
it
still
remained
the
legal
and
recognised
means
of
preventing
the
change
accordingly
it
was
twice
tried
during
the
wars
of
religion
in
france
with
success
in
england
with
disastrous
effects
it
is
a
universal
rule
that
a
right
is
not
given
up
until
the
necessity
of
its
surrender
is
proved
but
the
real
difficulty
arises
not
from
the
mode
in
which
the
power
was
exercised
but
from
the
way
in
which
it
was
defended
the
mediæval
writers
were
accustomed
to
generalise
they
disregarded
particular
circumstances
and
they
were
generally
ignorant
of
the
habits
and
ideas
of
their
age
living
in
the
cloister
and
writing
for
the
school
they
were
unacquainted
with
the
polity
and
institutions
around
them
and
sought
their
authorities
and
examples
in
antiquity
in
the
speculations
of
aristotle
and
the
maxims
of
the
civil
law
they
gave
to
their
political
doctrines
as
abstract
a
form
and
attributed
to
them
as
universal
an
application
as
the
modern
absolutists
or
the
more
recent
liberals
so
regardless
were
they
of
the
difference
between
ancient
times
and
their
own
that
the
jewish
chronicles
the
grecian
legislators
and
the
roman
code
supplied
them
indifferently
with
rules
and
instances
they
could
not
imagine
that
a
new
state
of
things
would
one
day
arise
in
which
their
theories
would
be
completely
obsolete
their
definitions
of
right
and
law
are
absolute
in
the
extreme
and
seem
often
to
admit
of
no
qualification
hence
their
character
is
essentially
revolutionary
and
they
contradict
both
the
authority
of
law
and
the
security
of
freedom
it
is
on
this
contradiction
that
the
common
notion
of
the
danger
of
ecclesiastical
pretensions
is
founded
but
the
men
who
take
alarm
at
the
tone
of
the
mediæval
claims
judge
them
with
a
theory
just
as
absolute
and
as
excessive
no
man
can
fairly
denounce
imaginary
pretensions
in
the
church
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
does
not
understand
that
rights
which
are
now
impossible
may
have
been
reasonable
and
legitimate
in
the
days
when
they
were
actually
exercised
the
zeal
with
which
goldwin
smith
condemns
the
irish
establishment
and
the
policy
of
the
ascendency
is
all
the
more
meritorious
because
he
has
no
conception
of
the
amount
of
iniquity
involved
in
them
the
state
church
of
ireland
however
anomalous
and
even
scandalous
its
position
may
be
as
the
church
of
a
dominant
minority
upheld
by
force
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
people
does
not
in
truth
rest
on
a
principle
different
from
that
of
other
state
churches
to
justify
the
existence
of
any
state
church
it
must
be
assumed
as
an
axiom
that
the
state
is
the
judge
of
religious
truth
and
that
it
is
bound
to
impose
upon
its
subjects
or
at
least
to
require
them
as
a
community
to
maintain
the
religion
which
it
judges
to
be
true
no
such
analogy
in
reality
subsists
as
is
here
assumed
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
irish
and
the
english
establishment
but
even
the
latter
has
no
similarity
of
principle
with
the
catholic
establishments
of
the
continent
the
fundamental
distinction
is
that
in
one
case
the
religion
of
the
people
is
adopted
by
the
state
whilst
in
the
other
the
state
imposes
a
religion
on
the
people
for
the
political
justification
of
catholic
establishments
no
more
is
required
than
the
theory
that
it
is
just
that
the
religion
of
a
country
should
be
represented
in
and
protected
by
its
government
this
is
evidently
and
universally
true
for
the
moral
basis
which
human
laws
require
can
only
be
derived
from
an
influence
which
was
originally
religious
as
well
as
moral
the
unity
of
moral
consciousness
must
be
founded
on
a
precedent
unity
of
spiritual
belief
according
to
this
theory
the
character
of
the
nation
determines
the
forms
of
the
state
consequently
it
is
a
theory
consistent
with
freedom
but
protestant
establishments
according
to
our
author
definition
which
applies
to
them
and
to
them
alone
rest
on
the
opposite
theory
that
the
will
of
the
state
is
independent
of
the
condition
of
the
community
and
that
it
may
or
indeed
must
impose
on
the
nation
a
faith
which
may
be
that
of
a
minority
and
which
in
some
cases
has
been
that
of
the
sovereign
alone
according
to
the
catholic
view
government
may
preserve
in
its
laws
and
by
its
authority
the
religion
of
the
community
according
to
the
protestant
view
it
may
be
bound
to
change
it
a
government
which
has
power
to
change
the
faith
of
its
subjects
must
be
absolute
in
other
things
so
that
one
theory
is
as
favourable
to
tyranny
as
the
other
is
opposed
to
it
the
safeguard
of
the
catholic
system
of
church
and
state
as
contrasted
with
the
protestant
was
that
very
authority
which
the
holy
see
used
to
prevent
the
sovereign
from
changing
the
religion
of
the
people
by
deposing
him
if
he
departed
from
it
himself
in
most
catholic
countries
the
church
preceded
the
state
some
she
assisted
to
form
all
she
contributed
to
sustain
throughout
western
europe
catholicism
was
the
religion
of
the
inhabitants
before
the
new
monarchies
were
founded
the
invaders
who
became
the
dominant
race
and
the
architects
of
a
new
system
of
states
were
sooner
or
later
compelled
in
order
to
preserve
their
dominion
to
abandon
their
pagan
or
their
arian
religion
and
to
adopt
the
common
faith
of
the
immense
majority
of
the
people
the
connection
between
church
and
state
was
therefore
a
natural
not
an
arbitrary
institution
the
result
of
the
submission
of
the
government
to
popular
influence
and
the
means
by
which
that
influence
was
perpetuated
no
catholic
government
ever
imposed
a
catholic
establishment
on
a
protestant
community
or
destroyed
a
protestant
establishment
even
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
greatest
wrong
ever
inflicted
on
the
protestant
subjects
of
a
catholic
state
will
bear
no
comparison
with
the
establishment
of
the
religion
of
a
minority
it
is
a
far
greater
wrong
than
the
most
severe
persecution
because
persecution
may
be
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
an
existing
society
as
in
the
case
of
the
early
christians
and
of
the
albigenses
but
a
state
church
can
only
be
justified
by
the
acquiescence
of
the
nation
in
every
other
case
it
is
a
great
social
danger
and
is
inseparable
from
political
oppression
goldwin
smith
vision
is
bounded
by
the
protestant
horizon
the
irish
establishment
has
one
great
mark
in
common
with
the
other
protestant
establishments
that
it
is
the
creature
of
the
state
and
an
instrument
of
political
influence
they
were
all
imposed
on
the
nation
by
the
state
power
sometimes
against
the
will
of
the
people
sometimes
against
that
of
the
crown
by
the
help
of
military
power
and
of
penal
laws
the
state
strove
to
provide
that
the
established
church
should
not
be
the
religion
of
the
minority
but
in
ireland
the
establishment
was
introduced
too
late
when
protestantism
had
spent
its
expansive
force
and
the
attraction
of
its
doctrine
no
longer
aided
the
efforts
of
the
civil
power
its
position
was
false
from
the
beginning
and
obliged
it
to
resort
to
persecution
and
official
proselytism
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
anomaly
whilst
therefore
in
all
cases
protestantism
became
the
established
church
by
an
exercise
of
authority
tyrannical
in
itself
and
possible
only
from
the
absolutism
of
the
ruling
power
in
ireland
the
tyranny
of
its
institution
was
perpetuated
in
the
system
by
which
it
was
upheld
and
in
the
violence
with
which
it
was
introduced
and
this
tyranny
continues
through
all
its
existence
it
is
the
religion
of
the
minority
the
church
of
an
alien
state
the
cause
of
suffering
and
of
disturbance
an
instrument
a
creature
and
a
monument
of
conquest
and
of
tyranny
it
has
nothing
in
common
with
catholic
establishments
and
none
of
those
qualities
which
in
the
anglican
church
redeem
in
part
the
guilt
of
its
origin
this
is
not
however
the
only
point
on
which
our
author
has
mistaken
the
peculiar
and
enormous
character
of
the
evils
of
ireland
with
the
injustice
which
generally
attends
his
historical
parallels
he
compares
the
policy
of
the
orange
faction
to
that
of
the
jacobins
in
france
the
ferocity
of
the
jacobins
was
in
a
slight
degree
redeemed
by
their
fanaticism
their
objects
were
not
entirely
selfish
they
murdered
aristocrats
not
only
because
they
hated
and
feared
them
but
because
they
wildly
imagined
them
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
social
and
political
millennium
which
according
to
rousseau
awaited
the
acceptance
of
mankind
no
comparison
can
be
more
unfair
than
one
which
places
the
pitiless
fanaticism
of
an
idea
in
the
same
line
with
the
cruelty
inspired
by
a
selfish
interest
the
reign
of
terror
is
one
of
the
most
portentous
events
in
history
because
it
was
the
consistent
result
of
the
simplest
and
most
acceptable
principle
of
the
revolution
it
saved
france
from
the
coalition
and
it
was
the
greatest
attempt
ever
made
to
mould
the
form
of
a
society
by
force
into
harmony
with
a
speculative
form
of
government
an
explanation
which
treats
as
its
primary
motive
and
judges
other
elements
as
merely
qualifying
it
is
ludicrously
inadequate
the
terrorism
of
robespierre
was
produced
by
the
theory
of
equality
which
was
not
a
mere
passion
but
a
political
doctrine
and
at
the
same
time
a
national
necessity
political
philosophers
who
since
the
time
of
hobbes
derive
the
state
from
a
social
compact
necessarily
assume
that
the
contracting
parties
were
equal
among
themselves
by
nature
therefore
all
men
possess
equal
rights
and
a
right
to
equality
the
introduction
of
the
civil
power
and
of
private
property
brought
inequality
into
the
world
this
is
opposed
to
the
condition
and
to
the
rights
of
the
natural
state
the
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
attributed
to
this
circumstance
the
evils
and
sufferings
of
society
in
france
the
ruin
of
the
public
finances
and
the
misery
of
the
lower
orders
were
both
laid
at
the
door
of
the
classes
whose
property
was
exempt
from
taxation
the
endeavours
of
successive
ministers
of
turgot
necker
and
calonne
to
break
down
the
privileges
of
the
aristocracy
and
of
the
clergy
were
defeated
by
the
resistance
of
the
old
society
the
government
attempted
to
save
itself
by
obtaining
concessions
from
the
notables
but
without
success
and
then
the
great
reform
which
the
state
was
impotent
to
carry
into
execution
was
effected
by
the
people
the
destruction
of
the
aristocratic
society
which
the
absolute
monarchy
had
failed
to
reform
was
the
object
and
the
triumph
of
the
revolution
and
the
constitution
of
declared
all
men
equal
and
withdrew
the
sanction
of
the
law
from
every
privilege
this
system
gave
only
an
equality
in
civil
rights
a
political
equality
such
as
already
subsisted
in
america
but
it
did
not
provide
against
the
existence
or
the
growth
of
those
social
inequalities
by
which
the
distribution
of
political
power
might
be
affected
but
the
theory
of
the
natural
equality
of
mankind
understands
equal
rights
as
rights
to
equal
things
in
the
state
and
requires
not
only
an
abstract
equality
of
rights
but
a
positive
equality
of
power
the
varieties
of
condition
caused
by
civilisation
were
so
objectionable
in
the
eyes
of
this
school
that
rousseau
wrote
earnest
vindications
of
natural
society
and
condemned
the
whole
social
fabric
of
europe
as
artificial
unnatural
and
monstrous
his
followers
laboured
to
destroy
the
work
of
history
and
the
influence
of
the
past
and
to
institute
a
natural
reasonable
order
of
things
which
should
dispose
all
men
on
an
equal
level
which
no
disparity
of
wealth
or
education
should
be
permitted
to
disturb
there
were
therefore
two
opinions
in
the
revolutionary
party
those
who
overthrew
the
monarchy
established
the
republic
and
commenced
the
war
were
content
with
having
secured
political
and
legal
equality
and
wished
to
leave
the
nation
in
the
enjoyment
of
those
advantages
which
fortune
distributes
unequally
but
the
consistent
partisans
of
equality
required
that
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
raise
one
man
above
another
the
girondists
wished
to
preserve
liberty
education
and
property
but
the
jacobins
who
held
that
an
absolute
equality
should
be
maintained
by
the
despotism
of
the
government
over
the
people
interpreted
more
justly
the
democratic
principles
which
were
common
to
both
parties
and
fortunately
for
their
country
they
triumphed
over
their
illogical
and
irresolute
adversaries
when
the
revolutionary
movement
was
once
established
says
de
maistre
nothing
but
jacobinism
could
save
france
three
weeks
after
the
fall
of
the
gironde
the
constitution
of
by
which
a
purely
ideal
democracy
was
instituted
was
presented
to
the
french
people
its
adoption
exactly
coincides
with
the
supremacy
of
robespierre
in
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
with
the
inauguration
of
the
reign
of
terror
the
danger
of
invasion
made
the
new
tyranny
possible
but
the
political
doctrine
of
the
jacobins
made
it
necessary
robespierre
explains
the
system
in
his
report
on
the
principles
of
political
morality
presented
to
the
convention
at
the
moment
of
his
greatest
power
if
the
principle
of
a
popular
government
in
time
of
peace
is
virtue
its
principle
during
revolution
is
virtue
and
terror
combined
virtue
without
which
terror
is
pernicious
terror
without
which
virtue
is
powerless
terror
is
nothing
but
rapid
severe
inflexible
justice
therefore
a
product
of
virtue
it
is
not
so
much
a
principle
in
itself
as
a
consequence
of
the
universal
principle
of
democracy
in
its
application
to
the
urgent
necessities
of
the
country
this
is
perfectly
true
envy
revenge
fear
were
motives
by
which
individuals
were
induced
or
enabled
to
take
part
in
the
administration
of
such
a
system
but
its
introduction
was
not
the
work
of
passion
but
the
inevitable
result
of
a
doctrine
the
democratic
constitution
required
to
be
upheld
by
violence
not
only
against
foreign
arms
but
against
the
state
of
society
and
the
nature
of
things
the
army
could
not
be
made
its
instrument
because
the
rulers
were
civilians
and
feared
beyond
all
things
the
influence
of
military
officers
in
the
state
officers
were
frequently
arrested
and
condemned
as
traitors
compelled
to
seek
safety
in
treason
watched
and
controlled
by
members
of
the
convention
in
the
absence
of
a
military
despotism
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
the
only
resource
the
same
theory
of
an
original
state
of
nature
from
which
the
principle
of
equality
was
deduced
also
taught
men
where
they
might
find
the
standard
of
equality
as
civilisation
by
means
of
civil
power
education
and
wealth
was
the
source
of
corruption
the
purity
of
virtue
was
to
be
found
in
the
classes
which
had
been
least
exposed
to
those
disturbing
causes
those
who
were
least
tainted
by
the
temptations
of
civilised
society
remained
in
the
natural
state
this
was
the
definition
of
the
new
notion
of
the
people
which
became
the
measure
of
virtue
and
of
equality
the
democratic
theory
required
that
the
whole
nation
should
be
reduced
to
the
level
of
the
lower
orders
in
all
those
things
in
which
society
creates
disparity
in
order
to
be
raised
to
the
level
of
that
republican
virtue
which
resides
among
those
who
have
retained
a
primitive
simplicity
by
escaping
the
influence
of
civilisation
the
form
of
government
and
the
condition
of
society
must
always
correspond
social
equality
is
therefore
a
postulate
of
pure
democracy
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
exist
if
the
constitution
was
to
stand
and
if
the
great
ideal
of
popular
enthusiasm
was
ever
to
be
realised
the
revolution
had
begun
by
altering
the
social
condition
of
the
country
the
correction
of
society
by
the
state
had
already
commenced
it
did
not
therefore
seem
impossible
to
continue
it
until
the
nation
should
be
completely
remodelled
in
conformity
with
the
new
principles
the
system
before
which
the
ancient
monarchy
had
fallen
which
was
so
fruitful
of
marvels
which
was
victorious
over
a
more
formidable
coalition
than
that
which
had
humbled
lewis
was
deemed
equal
to
the
task
of
completing
the
social
changes
which
had
been
so
extensively
begun
and
of
moulding
france
according
to
the
new
and
simple
pattern
the
equality
which
was
essential
to
the
existence
of
the
new
form
of
government
did
not
in
fact
exist
privilege
was
abolished
but
influence
remained
all
the
inequality
founded
on
wealth
education
ability
reputation
even
on
the
virtues
of
a
code
different
from
that
of
republican
morality
presented
obstacles
to
the
establishment
of
the
new
and
those
who
were
thus
distinguished
were
necessarily
enemies
of
the
state
with
perfect
reason
all
that
rose
above
the
common
level
or
did
not
conform
to
the
universal
rule
was
deemed
treasonable
the
difference
between
the
actual
society
and
the
ideal
equality
was
so
great
that
it
could
be
removed
only
by
violence
the
great
mass
of
those
who
perished
were
really
either
by
attachment
or
by
their
condition
in
antagonism
with
the
state
they
were
condemned
not
for
particular
acts
but
for
their
position
or
for
acts
which
denoted
not
so
much
a
hostile
design
as
an
incompatible
habit
by
the
des
which
was
provoked
by
this
conflict
between
the
form
of
government
and
the
real
state
of
the
country
whole
classes
rather
than
individuals
were
declared
objects
of
alarm
hence
the
proscription
was
wholesale
criminals
were
judged
and
executed
in
categories
and
the
merits
of
individual
cases
were
therefore
of
little
account
for
this
reason
leading
men
of
ability
bitterly
hostile
to
the
new
system
were
saved
by
danton
for
it
was
often
indifferent
who
were
the
victims
provided
the
group
to
which
they
belonged
was
struck
down
the
question
was
not
what
crimes
has
the
prisoner
committed
but
does
he
belong
to
one
of
those
classes
whose
existence
the
republic
can
not
tolerate
from
this
point
of
view
there
were
not
so
many
unjust
judgments
pronounced
at
least
in
paris
as
is
generally
believed
it
was
necessary
to
be
prodigal
of
blood
or
to
abandon
the
theory
of
liberty
and
equality
which
had
commanded
for
a
whole
generation
the
enthusiastic
devotion
of
educated
men
and
for
the
truth
of
which
thousands
of
its
believers
were
ready
to
die
the
truth
of
that
doctrine
was
tested
by
a
terrible
alternative
but
the
fault
lay
with
those
who
believed
it
not
exclusively
with
those
who
practised
it
there
were
few
who
could
administer
such
a
system
without
any
other
motive
but
devotion
to
the
idea
or
who
could
retain
the
coolness
and
indifference
of
which
just
is
an
extraordinary
example
most
of
the
terrorists
were
swayed
by
fear
for
themselves
or
by
the
frenzy
which
is
produced
by
familiarity
with
slaughter
but
this
is
of
small
account
the
significance
of
that
sanguinary
drama
lies
in
the
fact
that
a
political
abstraction
was
powerful
enough
to
make
men
think
themselves
right
in
destroying
masses
of
their
countrymen
in
the
attempt
to
impose
it
on
their
country
the
horror
of
that
system
and
its
failure
have
given
vitality
to
the
communistic
theory
it
was
unreasonable
to
attack
the
effect
instead
of
the
cause
and
cruel
to
destroy
the
proprietor
while
the
danger
lay
in
the
property
for
private
property
necessarily
produces
that
inequality
which
the
jacobin
theory
condemned
and
the
constitution
of
could
not
be
maintained
by
terrorism
without
communism
by
proscribing
the
rich
while
riches
were
tolerated
the
jacobins
were
guilty
of
inconsistency
in
omitting
to
attack
inequality
in
its
source
yet
no
man
who
admits
their
theory
has
a
right
to
complain
of
their
acts
the
one
proceeded
from
the
other
with
the
inflexible
logic
of
history
the
reign
of
terror
was
nothing
else
than
the
reign
of
those
who
conceive
that
liberty
and
equality
can
coexist
one
more
quotation
will
sufficiently
justify
what
we
have
said
of
the
sincerity
and
ignorance
which
goldwin
smith
shows
in
his
remarks
on
catholic
subjects
after
calling
the
bull
of
adrian
iv
the
and
the
despair
of
catholic
historians
he
proceeded
to
say
are
catholics
filled
with
perplexity
at
the
sight
of
infallibility
sanctioning
rapine
they
can
scarcely
be
less
perplexed
by
the
title
which
infallibility
puts
forward
to
the
dominion
of
ireland
but
this
perplexity
arises
entirely
from
the
assumption
which
may
be
an
article
of
faith
but
is
not
an
article
of
history
that
the
infallible
morality
of
the
pope
has
never
changed
pp
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
a
man
of
honour
and
ability
can
entertain
such
notions
of
the
character
of
the
papacy
as
these
words
imply
or
where
he
can
have
found
authorities
for
so
monstrous
a
caricature
we
will
only
say
that
infallibility
is
no
attribute
of
the
political
system
of
the
popes
and
that
the
bulls
of
adrian
and
alexander
are
not
instances
of
infallible
morality
great
as
the
errors
which
we
have
pointed
out
undoubtedly
are
the
book
itself
is
of
real
value
and
encourages
us
to
form
sanguine
hopes
of
the
future
services
of
its
author
to
historical
science
and
ultimately
to
religion
we
are
hardly
just
in
complaining
of
protestant
writers
who
fail
to
do
justice
to
the
church
there
are
not
very
many
amongst
ourselves
who
take
the
trouble
to
ascertain
her
real
character
as
a
visible
institution
or
to
know
how
her
nature
has
been
shown
in
her
history
we
know
the
doctrine
which
she
teaches
we
are
familiar
with
the
outlines
of
her
discipline
we
know
that
sanctity
is
one
of
her
marks
and
that
beneficence
has
characterised
her
influence
in
a
general
way
we
are
confident
that
historical
accusations
are
as
false
as
dogmatic
attacks
and
most
of
us
have
some
notion
of
the
way
in
which
the
current
imputations
are
to
be
met
but
as
to
her
principles
of
action
in
many
important
things
how
they
have
varied
in
course
of
time
what
changes
have
been
effected
by
circumstances
and
what
rules
have
never
been
broken
few
are
at
the
pains
to
inquire
as
adversaries
imagine
that
in
exposing
a
catholic
they
strike
catholicism
and
that
the
defects
of
the
men
are
imperfections
in
the
institution
and
a
proof
that
it
is
not
divine
so
we
grow
accustomed
to
confound
in
our
defence
that
which
is
defective
and
that
which
is
indefectible
and
to
discover
in
the
church
merits
as
as
are
the
accusations
of
her
different
foes
at
one
moment
we
are
told
that
catholicism
teaches
contempt
and
therefore
neglect
of
wealth
at
another
that
it
is
false
to
say
that
the
church
does
not
promote
temporal
prosperity
if
a
great
point
is
made
against
persecution
it
will
be
denied
that
she
is
intolerant
whilst
at
another
time
it
will
be
argued
that
heresy
and
unbelief
deserve
to
be
punished
we
can
not
be
surprised
that
protestants
do
not
know
the
church
better
than
we
do
ourselves
or
that
while
we
allow
no
evil
to
be
spoken
of
her
human
elements
those
who
deem
her
altogether
human
should
discover
in
her
the
defects
of
human
institutions
it
is
intensely
difficult
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
a
system
not
our
own
particular
principles
and
doctrines
are
easily
mastered
but
a
system
answering
all
the
spiritual
cravings
all
the
intellectual
capabilities
of
man
demands
more
than
a
mere
mental
effort
a
submission
of
the
intellect
an
act
of
faith
a
temporary
suspension
of
the
critical
faculty
this
applies
not
merely
to
the
christian
religion
with
its
unfathomable
mysteries
and
its
inexhaustible
fund
of
truth
but
to
the
fruits
of
human
speculation
nobody
has
ever
succeeded
in
writing
a
history
of
philosophy
without
incurring
either
the
reproach
that
he
is
a
mere
historian
incapable
of
entering
into
the
genius
of
any
system
or
a
mere
metaphysician
who
can
discern
in
all
other
philosophies
only
the
relation
they
bear
to
his
own
in
religion
the
difficulty
is
greater
still
and
greatest
of
all
with
catholicism
for
the
church
is
to
be
seen
not
in
books
but
in
life
no
divine
can
put
together
the
whole
body
of
her
doctrine
no
canonist
the
whole
fabric
of
her
law
no
historian
the
infinite
vicissitudes
of
her
career
the
protestant
who
wishes
to
be
informed
on
all
these
things
can
be
advised
to
rely
on
no
one
manual
on
no
encyclopædia
of
her
deeds
and
of
her
ideas
if
he
seeks
to
know
what
these
have
been
he
must
be
told
to
look
around
and
to
one
who
surveys
her
teaching
and
her
fortunes
through
all
ages
and
all
lands
ignorant
or
careless
of
that
which
is
essential
changeless
and
immortal
in
her
it
will
not
be
easy
to
discern
through
so
much
outward
change
a
regular
development
amid
such
variety
of
forms
the
unchanging
substance
in
so
many

fidelity

constant

nationality
whenever
great
intellectual
cultivation
has
been
combined
with
that
suffering
which
is
inseparable
from
extensive
changes
in
the
condition
of
the
people
men
of
speculative
or
imaginative
genius
have
sought
in
the
contemplation
of
an
ideal
society
a
remedy
or
at
least
a
consolation
for
evils
which
they
were
practically
unable
to
remove
poetry
has
always
preserved
the
idea
that
at
some
distant
time
or
place
in
the
western
islands
or
the
arcadian
region
an
innocent
and
contented
people
free
from
the
corruption
and
restraint
of
civilised
life
have
realised
the
legends
of
the
golden
age
the
office
of
the
poets
is
always
nearly
the
same
and
there
is
little
variation
in
the
features
of
their
ideal
world
but
when
philosophers
attempt
to
admonish
or
reform
mankind
by
devising
an
imaginary
state
their
motive
is
more
definite
and
immediate
and
their
commonwealth
is
a
satire
as
well
as
a
model
plato
and
plotinus
more
and
campanella
constructed
their
fanciful
societies
with
those
materials
which
were
omitted
from
the
fabric
of
the
actual
communities
by
the
defects
of
which
they
were
inspired
the
republic
the
utopia
and
the
city
of
the
sun
were
protests
against
a
state
of
things
which
the
experience
of
their
authors
taught
them
to
condemn
and
from
the
faults
of
which
they
took
refuge
in
the
opposite
extremes
they
remained
without
influence
and
have
never
passed
from
literary
into
political
history
because
something
more
than
discontent
and
speculative
ingenuity
is
needed
in
order
to
invest
a
political
idea
with
power
over
the
masses
of
mankind
the
scheme
of
a
philosopher
can
command
the
practical
allegiance
of
fanatics
only
not
of
nations
and
though
oppression
may
give
rise
to
violent
and
repeated
outbreaks
like
the
convulsions
of
a
man
in
pain
it
can
not
mature
a
settled
purpose
and
plan
of
regeneration
unless
a
new
notion
of
happiness
is
joined
to
the
sense
of
present
evil
the
history
of
religion
furnishes
a
complete
illustration
between
the
later
mediæval
sects
and
protestantism
there
is
an
essential
difference
that
outweighs
the
points
of
analogy
found
in
those
systems
which
are
regarded
as
heralds
of
the
reformation
and
is
enough
to
explain
the
vitality
of
the
last
in
comparison
with
the
others
whilst
wycliffe
and
hus
contradicted
certain
particulars
of
the
catholic
teaching
luther
rejected
the
authority
of
the
church
and
gave
to
the
individual
conscience
an
independence
which
was
sure
to
lead
to
an
incessant
resistance
there
is
a
similar
difference
between
the
revolt
of
the
netherlands
the
great
rebellion
the
war
of
independence
or
the
rising
of
brabant
on
the
one
hand
and
the
french
revolution
on
the
other
before
insurrections
were
provoked
by
particular
wrongs
and
were
justified
by
definite
complaints
and
by
an
appeal
to
principles
which
all
men
acknowledged
new
theories
were
sometimes
advanced
in
the
cause
of
controversy
but
they
were
accidental
and
the
great
argument
against
tyranny
was
fidelity
to
the
ancient
laws
since
the
change
produced
by
the
french
revolution
those
aspirations
which
are
awakened
by
the
evils
and
defects
of
the
social
state
have
come
to
act
as
permanent
and
energetic
forces
throughout
the
civilised
world
they
are
spontaneous
and
aggressive
needing
no
prophet
to
proclaim
no
champion
to
defend
them
but
popular
unreasoning
and
almost
irresistible
the
revolution
effected
this
change
partly
by
its
doctrines
partly
by
the
indirect
influence
of
events
it
taught
the
people
to
regard
their
wishes
and
wants
as
the
supreme
criterion
of
right
the
rapid
vicissitudes
of
power
in
which
each
party
successively
appealed
to
the
favour
of
the
masses
as
the
arbiter
of
success
accustomed
the
masses
to
be
arbitrary
as
well
as
insubordinate
the
fall
of
many
governments
and
the
frequent
redistribution
of
territory
deprived
all
settlements
of
the
dignity
of
permanence
tradition
and
prescription
ceased
to
be
guardians
of
authority
and
the
arrangements
which
proceeded
from
revolutions
from
the
triumphs
of
war
and
from
treaties
of
peace
were
equally
regardless
of
established
rights
duty
can
not
be
dissociated
from
right
and
nations
refuse
to
be
controlled
by
laws
which
are
no
protection
in
this
condition
of
the
world
theory
and
action
follow
close
upon
each
other
and
practical
evils
easily
give
birth
to
opposite
systems
in
the
realms
of
the
regularity
of
natural
progress
is
preserved
by
the
conflict
of
extremes
the
impulse
of
the
reaction
carries
men
from
one
extremity
towards
another
the
pursuit
of
a
remote
and
ideal
object
which
captivates
the
imagination
by
its
splendour
and
the
reason
by
its
simplicity
evokes
an
energy
which
would
not
be
inspired
by
a
rational
possible
end
limited
by
many
antagonistic
claims
and
confined
to
what
is
reasonable
practicable
and
just
one
excess
or
exaggeration
is
the
corrective
of
the
other
and
error
promotes
truth
where
the
masses
are
concerned
by
counterbalancing
a
contrary
error
the
few
have
not
strength
to
achieve
great
changes
unaided
the
many
have
not
wisdom
to
be
moved
by
truth
unmixed
where
the
disease
is
various
no
particular
definite
remedy
can
meet
the
wants
of
all
only
the
attraction
of
an
abstract
idea
or
of
an
ideal
state
can
unite
in
a
common
action
multitudes
who
seek
a
universal
cure
for
many
special
evils
and
a
common
restorative
applicable
to
many
different
conditions
and
hence
false
principles
which
correspond
with
the
bad
as
well
as
with
the
just
aspirations
of
mankind
are
a
normal
and
necessary
element
in
the
social
life
of
nations
theories
of
this
kind
are
just
inasmuch
as
they
are
provoked
by
definite
ascertained
evils
and
undertake
their
removal
they
are
useful
in
opposition
as
a
warning
or
a
threat
to
modify
existing
things
and
keep
awake
the
consciousness
of
wrong
they
can
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
the
reconstruction
of
civil
society
as
medicine
can
not
serve
for
food
but
they
may
influence
it
with
advantage
because
they
point
out
the
direction
though
not
the
measure
in
which
reform
is
needed
they
oppose
an
order
of
things
which
is
the
result
of
a
selfish
and
violent
abuse
of
power
by
the
ruling
classes
and
of
artificial
restriction
on
the
natural
progress
of
the
world
destitute
of
an
ideal
element
or
a
moral
purpose
practical
extremes
differ
from
the
theoretical
extremes
they
provoke
because
the
first
are
both
arbitrary
and
violent
whilst
the
last
though
also
revolutionary
are
at
the
same
time
remedial
in
one
case
the
wrong
is
voluntary
in
the
other
it
is
inevitable
this
is
the
general
character
of
the
contest
between
the
existing
order
and
the
subversive
theories
that
deny
its
legitimacy
there
are
three
principal
theories
of
this
kind
impugning
the
present
distribution
of
power
of
property
and
of
territory
and
attacking
respectively
the
aristocracy
the
middle
class
and
the
sovereignty
they
are
the
theories
of
equality
communism
and
nationality
though
sprung
from
a
common
origin
opposing
cognate
evils
and
connected
by
many
links
they
did
not
appear
simultaneously
rousseau
proclaimed
the
first
baboeuf
the
second
mazzini
the
third
and
the
third
is
the
most
recent
in
its
appearance
the
most
attractive
at
the
present
time
and
the
richest
in
promise
of
future
power
in
the
old
european
system
the
rights
of
nationalities
were
neither
recognised
by
governments
nor
asserted
by
the
people
the
interest
of
the
reigning
families
not
those
of
the
nations
regulated
the
frontiers
and
the
administration
was
conducted
generally
without
any
reference
to
popular
desires
where
all
liberties
were
suppressed
the
claims
of
national
independence
were
necessarily
ignored
and
a
princess
in
the
words
of
fénelon
carried
a
monarchy
in
her
wedding
portion
the
eighteenth
century
acquiesced
in
this
oblivion
of
corporate
rights
on
the
continent
for
the
absolutists
cared
only
for
the
state
and
the
liberals
only
for
the
individual
the
church
the
nobles
and
the
nation
had
no
place
in
the
popular
theories
of
the
age
and
they
devised
none
in
their
own
defence
for
they
were
not
openly
attacked
the
aristocracy
retained
its
privileges
and
the
church
her
property
and
the
dynastic
interest
which
overruled
the
natural
inclination
of
the
nations
and
destroyed
their
independence
nevertheless
maintained
their
integrity
the
national
sentiment
was
not
wounded
in
its
most
sensitive
part
to
dispossess
a
sovereign
of
his
hereditary
crown
and
to
annex
his
dominions
would
have
been
held
to
inflict
an
injury
upon
all
monarchies
and
to
furnish
their
subjects
with
a
dangerous
example
by
depriving
royalty
of
its
inviolable
character
in
time
of
war
as
there
was
no
national
cause
at
stake
there
was
no
attempt
to
rouse
national
feeling
the
courtesy
of
the
rulers
towards
each
other
was
proportionate
to
the
contempt
for
the
lower
orders
compliments
passed
between
the
commanders
of
hostile
armies
there
was
no
bitterness
and
no
excitement
battles
were
fought
with
the
pomp
and
pride
of
a
parade
the
art
of
war
became
a
slow
and
learned
game
the
monarchies
were
united
not
only
by
a
natural
community
of
interests
but
by
family
alliances
a
marriage
contract
sometimes
became
the
signal
for
an
interminable
war
whilst
family
connections
often
set
a
barrier
to
ambition
after
the
wars
of
religion
came
to
an
end
in
the
only
wars
were
those
which
were
waged
for
an
inheritance
or
a
dependency
or
against
countries
whose
system
of
government
exempted
them
from
the
common
law
of
dynastic
states
and
made
them
not
only
unprotected
but
obnoxious
these
countries
were
england
and
holland
until
holland
ceased
to
be
a
republic
and
until
in
england
the
defeat
of
the
jacobites
in
the
terminated
the
struggle
for
the
crown
there
was
one
country
however
which
still
continued
to
be
an
exception
one
monarch
whose
place
was
not
admitted
in
the
comity
of
kings
poland
did
not
possess
those
securities
for
stability
which
were
supplied
by
dynastic
connections
and
the
theory
of
legitimacy
wherever
a
crown
could
be
obtained
by
marriage
or
inheritance
a
monarch
without
royal
blood
a
crown
bestowed
by
the
nation
were
an
anomaly
and
an
outrage
in
that
age
of
dynastic
absolutism
the
country
was
excluded
from
the
european
system
by
the
nature
of
its
institutions
it
excited
a
cupidity
which
could
not
be
satisfied
it
gave
the
reigning
families
of
europe
no
hope
of
permanently
strengthening
themselves
by
intermarriage
with
its
rulers
or
of
obtaining
it
by
bequest
or
by
inheritance
the
habsburgs
had
contested
the
possession
of
spain
and
the
indies
with
the
french
bourbons
of
italy
with
the
spanish
bourbons
of
the
empire
with
the
house
of
wittelsbach
of
silesia
with
the
house
of
hohenzollern
there
had
been
wars
between
rival
houses
for
half
the
territories
of
italy
and
germany
but
none
could
hope
to
redeem
their
losses
or
increase
their
power
in
a
country
to
which
marriage
and
descent
gave
no
claim
where
they
could
not
permanently
inherit
they
endeavoured
by
intrigues
to
prevail
at
each
election
and
after
contending
in
support
of
candidates
who
were
their
partisans
the
neighbours
at
last
appointed
an
instrument
for
the
final
demolition
of
the
polish
state
till
then
no
nation
had
been
deprived
of
its
political
existence
by
the
christian
powers
and
whatever
disregard
had
been
shown
for
national
interests
and
sympathies
some
care
had
been
taken
to
conceal
the
wrong
by
a
hypocritical
perversion
of
law
but
the
partition
of
poland
was
an
act
of
wanton
violence
committed
in
open
defiance
not
only
of
popular
feeling
but
of
public
law
for
the
first
time
in
modern
history
a
great
state
was
suppressed
and
a
whole
nation
divided
among
its
enemies
this
famous
measure
the
most
revolutionary
act
of
the
old
absolutism
awakened
the
theory
of
nationality
in
europe
converting
a
dormant
right
into
an
aspiration
and
a
sentiment
into
a
political
claim
no
wise
or
honest
man
wrote
edmund
burke
can
approve
of
that
partition
or
can
contemplate
it
without
prognosticating
great
mischief
from
it
to
all
countries
at
some
future
time
thenceforward
there
was
a
nation
demanding
to
be
united
in
a
state
a
soul
as
it
were
wandering
in
search
of
a
body
in
which
to
begin
life
over
again
and
for
the
first
time
a
cry
was
heard
that
the
arrangement
of
states
was
unjust
that
their
limits
were
unnatural
and
that
a
whole
people
was
deprived
of
its
right
to
constitute
an
independent
community
before
that
claim
could
be
efficiently
asserted
against
the
overwhelming
power
of
its
opponents
before
it
gained
energy
after
the
last
partition
to
overcome
the
influence
of
long
habits
of
submission
and
of
the
contempt
which
previous
disorders
had
brought
upon
poland
the
ancient
european
system
was
in
ruins
and
a
new
world
was
rising
in
its
place
the
old
despotic
policy
which
made
the
poles
its
prey
had
two
adversaries
the
spirit
of
english
liberty
and
the
doctrines
of
that
revolution
which
destroyed
the
french
monarchy
with
its
own
weapons
and
these
two
contradicted
in
contrary
ways
the
theory
that
nations
have
no
collective
rights
at
the
present
day
the
theory
of
nationality
is
not
only
the
most
powerful
auxiliary
of
revolution
but
its
actual
substance
in
the
movements
of
the
last
three
years
this
however
is
a
recent
alliance
unknown
to
the
first
french
revolution
the
modern
theory
of
nationality
arose
partly
as
a
legitimate
consequence
partly
as
a
reaction
against
it
as
the
system
which
overlooked
national
division
was
opposed
by
liberalism
in
two
forms
the
french
and
the
english
so
the
system
which
insists
upon
them
proceeds
from
two
distinct
sources
and
exhibits
the
character
either
of
or
of
when
the
french
people
abolished
the
authorities
under
which
it
lived
and
became
its
own
master
france
was
in
danger
of
dissolution
for
the
common
will
is
difficult
to
ascertain
and
does
not
readily
agree
the
laws
said
vergniaud
in
the
debate
on
the
sentence
of
the
king
are
obligatory
only
as
the
presumptive
will
of
the
people
which
retains
the
right
of
approving
or
condemning
them
the
instant
it
manifests
its
wish
the
work
of
the
national
representation
the
law
must
disappear
this
doctrine
resolved
society
into
its
natural
elements
and
threatened
to
break
up
the
country
into
as
many
republics
as
there
were
communes
for
true
republicanism
is
the
principle
of
in
the
whole
and
in
all
the
parts
in
an
extensive
country
it
can
prevail
only
by
the
union
of
several
independent
communities
in
a
single
confederacy
as
in
greece
in
switzerland
in
the
netherlands
and
in
america
so
that
a
large
republic
not
founded
on
the
federal
principle
must
result
in
the
government
of
a
single
city
like
rome
and
paris
and
in
a
less
degree
athens
berne
and
amsterdam
or
in
other
words
a
great
democracy
must
either
sacrifice
to
unity
or
preserve
it
by
federalism
the
france
of
history
fell
together
with
the
french
state
which
was
the
growth
of
centuries
the
old
sovereignty
was
destroyed
the
local
authorities
were
looked
upon
with
aversion
and
alarm
the
new
central
authority
needed
to
be
established
on
a
new
principle
of
unity
the
state
of
nature
which
was
the
ideal
of
society
was
made
the
basis
of
the
nation
descent
was
put
in
the
place
of
tradition
and
the
french
people
was
regarded
as
a
physical
product
an
ethnological
not
historic
unit
it
was
assumed
that
a
unity
existed
separate
from
the
representation
and
the
government
wholly
independent
of
the
past
and
capable
at
any
moment
of
expressing
or
of
changing
its
mind
in
the
words
of
sieyès
it
was
no
longer
france
but
some
unknown
country
to
which
the
nation
was
transported
the
central
power
possessed
authority
inasmuch
as
it
obeyed
the
whole
and
no
divergence
was
permitted
from
the
universal
sentiment
this
power
endowed
with
volition
was
personified
in
the
republic
one
and
indivisible
the
title
signified
that
a
part
could
not
speak
or
act
for
the
whole
that
there
was
a
power
supreme
over
the
state
distinct
from
and
independent
of
its
members
and
it
expressed
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
notion
of
an
abstract
nationality
in
this
manner
the
idea
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
uncontrolled
by
the
past
gave
birth
to
the
idea
of
nationality
independent
of
the
political
influence
of
history
it
sprang
from
the
rejection
of
the
two
authorities
of
the
state
and
of
the
past
the
kingdom
of
france
was
geographically
as
well
as
politically
the
product
of
a
long
series
of
events
and
the
same
influences
which
built
up
the
state
formed
the
territory
the
revolution
repudiated
alike
the
agencies
to
which
france
owed
her
boundaries
and
those
to
which
she
owed
her
government
every
effaceable
trace
and
relic
of
national
history
was
carefully
wiped
away
the
system
of
administration
the
physical
divisions
of
the
country
the
classes
of
society
the
corporations
the
weights
and
measures
the
calendar
france
was
no
longer
bounded
by
the
limits
she
had
received
from
the
condemned
influence
of
her
history
she
could
recognise
only
those
which
were
set
by
nature
the
definition
of
the
nation
was
borrowed
from
the
material
world
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
loss
of
territory
it
became
not
only
an
abstraction
but
a
fiction
there
was
a
principle
of
nationality
in
the
ethnological
character
of
the
movement
which
is
the
source
of
the
common
observation
that
revolution
is
more
frequent
in
catholic
than
in
protestant
countries
it
is
in
fact
more
frequent
in
the
latin
than
in
the
teutonic
world
because
it
depends
partly
on
a
national
impulse
which
is
only
awakened
where
there
is
an
alien
element
the
vestige
of
a
foreign
dominion
to
expel
western
europe
has
undergone
two
conquests
one
by
the
romans
and
one
by
the
germans
and
twice
received
laws
from
the
invaders
each
time
it
rose
again
against
the
victorious
race
and
the
two
great
reactions
while
they
differ
according
to
the
different
characters
of
the
two
conquests
have
the
phenomenon
of
imperialism
in
common
the
roman
republic
laboured
to
crush
the
subjugated
nations
into
a
homogeneous
and
obedient
mass
but
the
increase
which
the
proconsular
authority
obtained
in
the
process
subverted
the
republican
government
and
the
reaction
of
the
provinces
against
rome
assisted
in
establishing
the
empire
the
cæsarean
system
gave
an
unprecedented
freedom
to
the
dependencies
and
raised
them
to
a
civil
equality
which
put
an
end
to
the
dominion
of
race
over
race
and
of
class
over
class
the
monarchy
was
hailed
as
a
refuge
from
the
pride
and
cupidity
of
the
roman
people
and
the
love
of
equality
the
hatred
of
nobility
and
the
tolerance
of
despotism
implanted
by
rome
became
at
least
in
gaul
the
chief
feature
of
the
national
character
but
among
the
nations
whose
vitality
had
been
broken
down
by
the
stern
republic
not
one
retained
the
materials
necessary
to
enjoy
independence
or
to
develop
a
new
history
the
political
faculty
which
organises
states
and
finds
society
in
a
moral
order
was
exhausted
and
the
christian
doctors
looked
in
vain
over
the
waste
of
ruins
for
a
people
by
whose
aid
the
church
might
survive
the
decay
of
rome
a
new
element
of
national
life
was
brought
to
that
declining
world
by
the
enemies
who
destroyed
it
the
flood
of
barbarians
settled
over
it
for
a
season
and
then
subsided
and
when
the
landmarks
of
civilisation
appeared
once
more
it
was
found
that
the
soil
had
been
impregnated
with
a
fertilising
and
regenerating
influence
and
that
the
inundation
had
laid
the
germs
of
future
states
and
of
a
new
society
the
political
sense
and
energy
came
with
the
new
blood
and
was
exhibited
in
the
power
exercised
by
the
younger
race
upon
the
old
and
in
the
establishment
of
a
graduated
freedom
instead
of
universal
equal
rights
the
actual
enjoyment
of
which
is
necessarily
contingent
on
and
commensurate
with
power
the
rights
of
the
people
were
made
dependent
on
a
variety
of
conditions
the
first
of
which
was
the
distribution
of
property
civil
society
became
a
classified
organism
instead
of
a
formless
combination
of
atoms
and
the
feudal
system
gradually
arose
roman
gaul
had
so
thoroughly
adopted
the
ideas
of
absolute
authority
and
undistinguished
equality
during
the
five
centuries
between
cæsar
and
clovis
that
the
people
could
never
be
reconciled
to
the
new
system
feudalism
remained
a
foreign
importation
and
the
feudal
aristocracy
an
alien
race
and
the
common
people
of
france
sought
protection
against
both
in
the
roman
jurisprudence
and
the
power
of
the
crown
the
development
of
absolute
monarchy
by
the
help
of
democracy
is
the
one
constant
character
of
french
history
the
royal
power
feudal
at
first
and
limited
by
the
immunities
and
the
great
vassals
became
more
popular
as
it
grew
more
absolute
while
the
suppression
of
aristocracy
the
removal
of
the
intermediate
authorities
was
so
particularly
the
object
of
the
nation
that
it
was
more
energetically
accomplished
after
the
fall
of
the
throne
the
monarchy
which
had
been
engaged
from
the
thirteenth
century
in
curbing
the
nobles
was
at
last
thrust
aside
by
the
democracy
because
it
was
too
dilatory
in
the
work
and
was
unable
to
deny
its
own
origin
and
effectually
ruin
the
class
from
which
it
sprang
all
those
things
which
constitute
the
peculiar
character
of
the
french
revolution
the
demand
for
equality
the
hatred
of
nobility
and
feudalism
and
of
the
church
which
was
connected
with
them
the
constant
reference
to
pagan
examples
the
suppression
of
monarchy
the
new
code
of
law
the
breach
with
tradition
and
the
substitution
of
an
ideal
system
for
everything
that
had
proceeded
from
the
mixture
and
mutual
action
of
the
races
all
these
exhibit
the
common
type
of
a
reaction
against
the
effects
of
the
frankish
invasion
the
hatred
of
royalty
was
less
than
the
hatred
of
aristocracy
privileges
were
more
detested
than
tyranny
and
the
king
perished
because
of
the
origin
of
his
authority
rather
than
because
of
its
abuse
monarchy
unconnected
with
aristocracy
became
popular
in
france
even
when
most
uncontrolled
whilst
the
attempt
to
reconstitute
the
throne
and
to
limit
and
fence
it
with
its
peers
broke
down
because
the
old
teutonic
elements
on
which
it
relied
hereditary
nobility
primogeniture
and
privilege
were
no
longer
tolerated
the
substance
of
the
ideas
of
is
not
the
limitation
of
the
sovereign
power
but
the
abrogation
of
intermediate
powers
these
powers
and
the
classes
which
enjoyed
them
come
in
latin
europe
from
a
barbarian
origin
and
the
movement
which
calls
itself
liberal
is
essentially
national
if
liberty
were
its
object
its
means
would
be
the
establishment
of
great
independent
authorities
not
derived
from
the
state
and
its
model
would
be
england
but
its
object
is
equality
and
it
seeks
like
france
in
to
cast
out
the
elements
of
inequality
which
were
introduced
by
the
teutonic
race
this
is
the
object
which
italy
and
spain
have
had
in
common
with
france
and
herein
consists
the
natural
league
of
the
latin
nations
this
national
element
in
the
movement
was
not
understood
by
the
revolutionary
leaders
at
first
their
doctrine
appeared
entirely
contrary
to
the
idea
of
nationality
they
taught
that
certain
general
principles
of
government
were
absolutely
right
in
all
states
and
they
asserted
in
theory
the
unrestricted
freedom
of
the
individual
and
the
supremacy
of
the
will
over
every
external
necessity
or
obligation
this
is
in
apparent
contradiction
to
the
national
theory
that
certain
natural
forces
ought
to
determine
the
character
the
form
and
the
policy
of
the
state
by
which
a
kind
of
fate
is
put
in
the
place
of
freedom
accordingly
the
national
sentiment
was
not
developed
directly
out
of
the
revolution
in
which
it
was
involved
but
was
exhibited
first
in
resistance
to
it
when
the
attempt
to
emancipate
had
been
absorbed
in
the
desire
to
subjugate
and
the
republic
had
been
succeeded
by
the
empire
napoleon
called
a
new
power
into
existence
by
attacking
nationality
in
russia
by
delivering
it
in
italy
by
governing
in
defiance
of
it
in
germany
and
spain
the
sovereigns
of
these
countries
were
deposed
or
degraded
and
a
system
of
administration
was
introduced
which
was
french
in
its
origin
its
spirit
and
its
instruments
the
people
resisted
the
change
the
movement
against
it
was
popular
and
spontaneous
because
the
rulers
were
absent
or
helpless
and
it
was
national
because
it
was
directed
against
foreign
institutions
in
tyrol
in
spain
and
afterwards
in
prussia
the
people
did
not
receive
the
impulse
from
the
government
but
undertook
of
their
own
accord
to
cast
out
the
armies
and
the
ideas
of
revolutionised
france
men
were
made
conscious
of
the
national
element
of
the
revolution
by
its
conquests
not
in
its
rise
the
three
things
which
the
empire
most
openly
oppressed
religion
national
independence
and
political
liberty
united
in
a
league
to
animate
the
great
uprising
by
which
napoleon
fell
under
the
influence
of
that
memorable
alliance
a
political
spirit
was
called
forth
on
the
continent
which
clung
to
freedom
and
abhorred
revolution
and
sought
to
restore
to
develop
and
to
reform
the
decayed
national
institutions
the
men
who
proclaimed
these
ideas
stein
and
görres
humboldt
müller
and
de
maistre
were
as
hostile
to
bonapartism
as
to
the
absolutism
of
the
old
governments
and
insisted
on
the
national
rights
which
had
been
invaded
equally
by
both
and
which
they
hoped
to
restore
by
the
destruction
of
the
french
supremacy
with
the
cause
that
triumphed
at
waterloo
the
friends
of
the
revolution
had
no
sympathy
for
they
had
learned
to
identify
their
doctrine
with
the
cause
of
france
the
holland
house
whigs
in
england
the
afrancesados
in
spain
the
muratists
in
italy
and
the
partisans
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
merging
patriotism
in
their
revolutionary
affections
regretted
the
fall
of
the
french
power
and
looked
with
alarm
at
those
new
and
unknown
forces
which
the
war
of
deliverance
had
evoked
and
which
were
as
menacing
to
french
liberalism
as
to
french
supremacy
but
the
new
aspirations
for
national
and
popular
rights
were
crushed
at
the
restoration
the
liberals
of
those
days
cared
for
freedom
not
in
the
shape
of
national
independence
but
of
french
institutions
and
they
combined
against
the
nations
with
the
ambition
of
the
governments
they
were
as
ready
to
sacrifice
nationality
to
their
ideal
as
the
holy
alliance
was
to
the
interests
of
absolutism
talleyrand
indeed
declared
at
vienna
that
the
polish
question
ought
to
have
precedence
over
all
other
questions
because
the
partition
of
poland
had
been
one
of
the
first
and
greatest
causes
of
the
evils
which
europe
had
suffered
but
dynastic
interests
prevailed
all
the
sovereigns
represented
at
vienna
recovered
their
dominions
except
the
king
of
saxony
who
was
punished
for
his
fidelity
to
napoleon
but
the
states
that
were
unrepresented
in
the
reigning
families
poland
venice
and
genoa
were
not
revived
and
even
the
pope
had
great
difficulty
in
recovering
the
legations
from
the
grasp
of
austria
nationality
which
the
old
had
ignored
which
had
been
outraged
by
the
revolution
and
the
empire
received
after
its
first
open
demonstration
the
hardest
blow
at
the
congress
of
vienna
the
principle
which
the
first
partition
had
generated
to
which
the
revolution
had
given
a
basis
of
theory
which
had
been
lashed
by
the
empire
into
a
momentary
convulsive
effort
was
matured
by
the
long
error
of
the
restoration
into
a
consistent
doctrine
nourished
and
justified
by
the
situation
of
europe
the
governments
of
the
holy
alliance
devoted
themselves
to
suppress
with
equal
care
the
revolutionary
spirit
by
which
they
had
been
threatened
and
the
national
spirit
by
which
they
had
been
restored
austria
which
owed
nothing
to
the
national
movement
and
had
prevented
its
revival
after
naturally
took
the
lead
in
repressing
it
every
disturbance
of
the
final
settlements
of
every
aspiration
for
changes
or
reforms
was
condemned
as
sedition
this
system
repressed
the
good
with
the
evil
tendencies
of
the
age
and
the
resistance
which
it
provoked
during
the
generation
that
passed
away
from
the
restoration
to
the
fall
of
metternich
and
again
under
the
reaction
which
commenced
with
schwarzenberg
and
ended
with
the
administrations
of
bach
and
manteuffel
proceeded
from
various
combinations
of
the
opposite
forms
of
liberalism
in
the
successive
phases
of
that
struggle
the
idea
that
national
claims
are
above
all
other
rights
gradually
rose
to
the
supremacy
which
it
now
possesses
among
the
revolutionary
agencies
the
first
liberal
movement
that
of
the
carbonari
in
the
south
of
europe
had
no
specific
national
character
but
was
supported
by
the
bonapartists
both
in
spain
and
italy
in
the
following
years
the
opposite
ideas
of
came
to
the
front
and
a
revolutionary
movement
in
many
respects
hostile
to
the
principles
of
revolution
began
in
defence
of
liberty
religion
and
nationality
all
these
causes
were
united
in
the
irish
agitation
and
in
the
greek
belgian
and
polish
revolutions
those
sentiments
which
had
been
insulted
by
napoleon
and
had
risen
against
him
rose
against
the
governments
of
the
restoration
they
had
been
oppressed
by
the
sword
and
then
by
the
treaties
the
national
principle
added
force
but
not
justice
to
this
movement
which
in
every
case
but
poland
was
successful
a
period
followed
in
which
it
degenerated
into
a
purely
national
idea
as
the
agitation
for
repeal
succeeded
emancipation
and
panslavism
and
panhellenism
arose
under
the
auspices
of
the
eastern
church
this
was
the
third
phase
of
the
resistance
to
the
settlement
of
vienna
which
was
weak
because
it
failed
to
satisfy
national
or
constitutional
aspirations
either
of
which
would
have
been
a
safeguard
against
the
other
by
a
moral
if
not
by
a
popular
justification
at
first
in
the
people
rose
against
their
conquerors
in
defence
of
their
legitimate
rulers
they
refused
to
be
governed
by
usurpers
in
the
period
between
and
they
resolved
that
they
would
not
be
misgoverned
by
strangers
the
french
administration
was
often
better
than
that
which
it
displaced
but
there
were
prior
claimants
for
the
authority
exercised
by
the
french
and
at
first
the
national
contest
was
a
contest
for
legitimacy
in
the
second
period
this
element
was
wanting
no
dispossessed
princes
led
the
greeks
the
belgians
or
the
poles
the
turks
the
dutch
and
the
russians
were
attacked
not
as
usurpers
but
as
oppressors
because
they
misgoverned
not
because
they
were
of
a
different
race
then
began
a
time
when
the
text
simply
was
that
nations
would
not
be
governed
by
foreigners
power
legitimately
obtained
and
exercised
with
moderation
was
declared
invalid
national
rights
like
religion
had
borne
part
in
the
previous
combinations
and
had
been
auxiliaries
in
the
struggles
for
freedom
but
now
nationality
became
a
paramount
claim
which
was
to
assert
itself
alone
which
might
put
forward
as
pretexts
the
rights
of
rulers
the
liberties
of
the
people
the
safety
of
religion
but
which
if
no
such
union
could
be
formed
was
to
prevail
at
the
expense
of
every
other
cause
for
which
nations
make
sacrifices
metternich
is
next
to
napoleon
the
chief
promoter
of
this
theory
for
the
character
of
the
restoration
was
most
distinct
in
austria
and
it
is
in
opposition
to
the
austrian
government
that
nationality
grew
into
a
system
napoleon
who
trusting
to
his
armies
despised
moral
forces
in
politics
was
overthrown
by
their
rising
austria
committed
the
same
fault
in
the
government
of
her
italian
provinces
the
kingdom
of
italy
had
united
all
the
northern
part
of
the
peninsula
in
a
single
state
and
the
national
feelings
which
the
french
repressed
elsewhere
were
encouraged
as
a
safeguard
of
their
power
in
italy
and
in
poland
when
the
tide
of
victory
turned
austria
invoked
against
the
french
the
aid
of
the
new
sentiment
they
had
fostered
nugent
announced
in
his
proclamation
to
the
italians
that
they
should
become
an
independent
nation
the
same
spirit
served
different
masters
and
contributed
first
to
the
destruction
of
the
old
states
then
to
the
expulsion
of
the
french
and
again
under
charles
albert
to
a
new
revolution
it
was
appealed
to
in
the
name
of
the
most
contradictory
principles
of
government
and
served
all
parties
in
succession
because
it
was
one
in
which
all
could
unite
beginning
by
a
protest
against
the
dominion
of
race
over
race
its
mildest
and
form
it
grew
into
a
condemnation
of
every
state
that
included
different
races
and
finally
became
the
complete
and
consistent
theory
that
the
state
and
the
nation
must
be
it
is
says
mill
in
general
a
necessary
condition
of
free
institutions
that
the
boundaries
of
governments
should
coincide
in
the
main
with
those
of
nationalities
the
outward
historical
progress
of
this
idea
from
an
indefinite
aspiration
to
be
the
keystone
of
a
political
system
may
be
traced
in
the
life
of
the
man
who
gave
to
it
the
element
in
which
its
strength
resides
giuseppe
mazzini
he
found
carbonarism
impotent
against
the
measures
of
the
governments
and
resolved
to
give
new
life
to
the
liberal
movement
by
transferring
it
to
the
ground
of
nationality
exile
is
the
nursery
of
nationality
as
oppression
is
the
school
of
liberalism
and
mazzini
conceived
the
idea
of
young
italy
when
he
was
a
refugee
at
marseilles
in
the
same
way
the
polish
exiles
are
the
champions
of
every
national
movement
for
to
them
all
political
rights
are
absorbed
in
the
idea
of
independence
which
however
they
may
differ
with
each
other
is
the
one
aspiration
common
to
them
all
towards
the
year
literature
also
contributed
to
the
national
idea
it
was
the
time
says
mazzini
of
the
great
conflict
between
the
romantic
and
the
classical
school
which
might
with
equal
truth
be
called
a
conflict
between
the
partisans
of
freedom
and
of
authority
the
romantic
school
was
infidel
in
italy
and
catholic
in
germany
but
in
both
it
had
the
common
effect
of
encouraging
national
history
and
literature
and
dante
was
as
great
an
authority
with
the
italian
democrats
as
with
the
leaders
of
the
mediæval
revival
at
vienna
munich
and
berlin
but
neither
the
influence
of
the
exiles
nor
that
of
the
poets
and
critics
of
the
new
party
extended
over
the
masses
it
was
a
sect
without
popular
sympathy
or
encouragement
a
conspiracy
founded
not
on
a
grievance
but
on
a
doctrine
and
when
the
attempt
to
rise
was
made
in
savoy
in
under
a
banner
with
the
motto
unity
independence
god
and
humanity
the
people
were
puzzled
at
its
object
and
indifferent
to
its
failure
but
mazzini
continued
his
propaganda
developed
his
into
a
and
established
in
the
international
league
of
nations
the
people
he
said
in
his
opening
address
is
penetrated
with
only
one
idea
that
of
unity
and
nationality
there
is
no
international
question
as
to
forms
of
government
but
only
a
national
question
the
revolution
of
unsuccessful
in
its
national
purpose
prepared
the
subsequent
victories
of
nationality
in
two
ways
the
first
of
these
was
the
restoration
of
the
austrian
power
in
italy
with
a
new
and
more
energetic
centralisation
which
gave
no
promise
of
freedom
whilst
that
system
prevailed
the
right
was
on
the
side
of
the
national
aspirations
and
they
were
revived
in
a
more
complete
and
cultivated
form
by
manin
the
policy
of
the
austrian
government
which
failed
during
the
ten
years
of
the
reaction
to
convert
the
tenure
by
force
into
a
tenure
by
right
and
to
establish
with
free
institutions
the
condition
of
allegiance
gave
a
negative
encouragement
to
the
theory
it
deprived
francis
joseph
of
all
active
support
and
sympathy
in
for
he
was
more
clearly
wrong
in
his
conduct
than
his
enemies
in
their
doctrines
the
real
cause
of
the
energy
which
the
national
theory
has
acquired
is
however
the
triumph
of
the
democratic
principle
in
france
and
its
recognition
by
the
european
powers
the
theory
of
nationality
is
involved
in
the
democratic
theory
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
general
will
one
hardly
knows
what
any
division
of
the
human
race
should
be
free
to
do
if
not
to
determine
with
which
of
the
various
collective
bodies
of
human
beings
they
choose
to
associate
themselves
it
is
by
this
act
that
a
nation
constitutes
itself
to
have
a
collective
will
unity
is
necessary
and
independence
is
requisite
in
order
to
assert
it
unity
and
nationality
are
still
more
essential
to
the
notion
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
than
the
cashiering
of
monarchs
or
the
revocation
of
laws
arbitrary
acts
of
this
kind
may
be
prevented
by
the
happiness
of
the
people
or
the
popularity
of
the
king
but
a
nation
inspired
by
the
democratic
idea
can
not
with
consistency
allow
a
part
of
itself
to
belong
to
a
foreign
state
or
the
whole
to
be
divided
into
several
native
states
the
theory
of
nationality
therefore
proceeds
from
both
the
principles
which
divide
the
political
world
from
legitimacy
which
ignores
its
claims
and
from
the
revolution
which
assumes
them
and
for
the
same
reason
it
is
the
chief
weapon
of
the
last
against
the
first
in
pursuing
the
outward
and
visible
growth
of
the
national
theory
we
are
prepared
for
an
examination
of
its
political
character
and
value
the
absolutism
which
has
created
it
denies
equally
that
absolute
right
of
national
unity
which
is
a
product
of
democracy
and
that
claim
of
national
liberty
which
belongs
to
the
theory
of
freedom
these
two
views
of
nationality
corresponding
to
the
french
and
to
the
english
systems
are
connected
in
name
only
and
are
in
reality
the
opposite
extremes
of
political
thought
in
one
case
nationality
is
founded
on
the
perpetual
supremacy
of
the
collective
will
of
which
the
unity
of
the
nation
is
the
necessary
condition
to
which
every
other
influence
must
defer
and
against
which
no
obligation
enjoys
authority
and
all
resistance
is
tyrannical
the
nation
is
here
an
ideal
unit
founded
on
the
race
in
defiance
of
the
modifying
action
of
external
causes
of
tradition
and
of
existing
rights
it
overrules
the
rights
and
wishes
of
the
inhabitants
absorbing
their
divergent
interests
in
a
fictitious
unity
sacrifices
their
several
inclinations
and
duties
to
the
higher
claim
of
nationality
and
crushes
all
natural
rights
and
all
established
liberties
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
itself
whenever
a
single
definite
object
is
made
the
supreme
end
of
the
state
be
it
the
advantage
of
a
class
the
safety
or
the
power
of
the
country
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
or
the
support
of
any
speculative
idea
the
state
becomes
for
the
time
inevitably
absolute
liberty
alone
demands
for
its
realisation
the
limitation
of
the
public
authority
for
liberty
is
the
only
object
which
benefits
all
alike
and
provokes
no
sincere
opposition
in
supporting
the
claims
of
national
unity
governments
must
be
subverted
in
whose
title
there
is
no
flaw
and
whose
policy
is
beneficent
and
equitable
and
subjects
must
be
compelled
to
transfer
their
allegiance
to
an
authority
for
which
they
have
no
attachment
and
which
may
be
practically
a
foreign
domination
connected
with
this
theory
in
nothing
except
in
the
common
enmity
of
the
absolute
state
is
the
theory
which
represents
nationality
as
an
essential
but
not
a
supreme
element
in
determining
the
forms
of
the
state
it
is
distinguished
from
the
other
because
it
tends
to
diversity
and
not
to
uniformity
to
harmony
and
not
to
unity
because
it
aims
not
at
an
arbitrary
change
but
at
careful
respect
for
the
existing
conditions
of
political
life
and
because
it
obeys
the
laws
and
results
of
history
not
the
aspirations
of
an
ideal
future
while
the
theory
of
unity
makes
the
nation
a
source
of
despotism
and
revolution
the
theory
of
liberty
regards
it
as
the
bulwark
of
and
the
foremost
limit
to
the
excessive
power
of
the
state
private
rights
which
are
sacrificed
to
the
unity
are
preserved
by
the
union
of
nations
no
power
can
so
efficiently
resist
the
tendencies
of
centralisation
of
corruption
and
of
absolutism
as
that
community
which
is
the
vastest
that
can
be
included
in
a
state
which
imposes
on
its
members
a
consistent
similarity
of
character
interest
and
opinion
and
which
arrests
the
action
of
the
sovereign
by
the
influence
of
a
divided
patriotism
the
presence
of
different
nations
under
the
same
sovereignty
is
similar
in
its
effect
to
the
independence
of
the
church
in
the
state
it
provides
against
the
servility
which
flourishes
under
the
shadow
of
a
single
authority
by
balancing
interests
multiplying
associations
and
giving
to
the
subject
the
restraint
and
support
of
a
combined
opinion
in
the
same
way
it
promotes
independence
by
forming
definite
groups
of
public
opinion
and
by
affording
a
great
source
and
centre
of
political
sentiments
and
of
notions
of
duty
not
derived
from
the
sovereign
will
liberty
provokes
diversity
and
diversity
preserves
liberty
by
supplying
the
means
of
organisation
all
those
portions
of
law
which
govern
the
relations
of
men
with
each
other
and
regulate
social
life
are
the
varying
result
of
national
custom
and
the
creation
of
private
society
in
these
things
therefore
the
several
nations
will
differ
from
each
other
for
they
themselves
have
produced
them
and
they
do
not
owe
them
to
the
state
which
rules
them
all
this
diversity
in
the
same
state
is
a
firm
barrier
against
the
intrusion
of
the
government
beyond
the
political
sphere
which
is
common
to
all
into
the
social
department
which
escapes
legislation
and
is
ruled
by
spontaneous
laws
this
sort
of
interference
is
characteristic
of
an
absolute
government
and
is
sure
to
provoke
a
reaction
and
finally
a
remedy
that
intolerance
of
social
freedom
which
is
natural
to
absolutism
is
sure
to
find
a
corrective
in
the
national
diversities
which
no
other
force
could
so
efficiently
provide
the
of
several
nations
under
the
same
state
is
a
test
as
well
as
the
best
security
of
its
freedom
it
is
also
one
of
the
chief
instruments
of
civilisation
and
as
such
it
is
in
the
natural
and
providential
order
and
indicates
a
state
of
greater
advancement
than
the
national
unity
which
is
the
ideal
of
modern
liberalism
the
combination
of
different
nations
in
one
state
is
as
necessary
a
condition
of
civilised
life
as
the
combination
of
men
in
society
inferior
races
are
raised
by
living
in
political
union
with
races
intellectually
superior
exhausted
and
decaying
nations
are
revived
by
the
contact
of
a
younger
vitality
nations
in
which
the
elements
of
organisation
and
the
capacity
for
government
have
been
lost
either
through
the
demoralising
influence
of
despotism
or
the
disintegrating
action
of
democracy
are
restored
and
educated
anew
under
the
discipline
of
a
stronger
and
less
corrupted
race
this
fertilising
and
regenerating
process
can
only
be
obtained
by
living
under
one
government
it
is
in
the
cauldron
of
the
state
that
the
fusion
takes
place
by
which
the
vigour
the
knowledge
and
the
capacity
of
one
portion
of
mankind
may
be
communicated
to
another
where
political
and
national
boundaries
coincide
society
ceases
to
advance
and
nations
relapse
into
a
condition
corresponding
to
that
of
men
who
renounce
intercourse
with
their
the
difference
between
the
two
unites
mankind
not
only
by
the
benefits
it
confers
on
those
who
live
together
but
because
it
connects
society
either
by
a
political
or
a
national
bond
gives
to
every
people
an
interest
in
its
neighbours
either
because
they
are
under
the
same
government
or
because
they
are
of
the
same
race
and
thus
promotes
the
interests
of
humanity
of
civilisation
and
of
religion
christianity
rejoices
at
the
mixture
of
races
as
paganism
identifies
itself
with
their
differences
because
truth
is
universal
and
errors
various
and
particular
in
the
ancient
world
idolatry
and
nationality
went
together
and
the
same
term
is
applied
in
scripture
to
both
it
was
the
mission
of
the
church
to
overcome
national
differences
the
period
of
her
undisputed
supremacy
was
that
in
which
all
western
europe
obeyed
the
same
laws
all
literature
was
contained
in
one
language
and
the
political
unity
of
christendom
was
personified
in
a
single
potentate
while
its
intellectual
unity
was
represented
in
one
university
as
the
ancient
romans
concluded
their
conquests
by
carrying
away
the
gods
of
the
conquered
people
charlemagne
overcame
the
national
resistance
of
the
saxons
only
by
the
forcible
destruction
of
their
pagan
rites
out
of
the
mediæval
period
and
the
combined
action
of
the
german
race
and
the
church
came
forth
a
new
system
of
nations
and
a
new
conception
of
nationality
nature
was
overcome
in
the
nation
as
well
as
in
the
individual
in
pagan
and
uncultivated
times
nations
were
distinguished
from
each
other
by
the
widest
diversity
not
only
in
religion
but
in
customs
language
and
character
under
the
new
law
they
had
many
things
in
common
the
old
barriers
which
separated
them
were
removed
and
the
new
principle
of
which
christianity
imposed
enabled
them
to
live
together
under
the
same
authority
without
necessarily
losing
their
cherished
habits
their
customs
or
their
laws
the
new
idea
of
freedom
made
room
for
different
races
in
one
state
a
nation
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
to
the
ancient
world
the
progeny
of
a
common
ancestor
or
the
aboriginal
product
of
a
particular
region
a
result
of
merely
physical
and
material
causes
but
a
moral
and
political
being
not
the
creation
of
geographical
or
physiological
unity
but
developed
in
the
course
of
history
by
the
action
of
the
state
it
is
derived
from
the
state
not
supreme
over
it
a
state
may
in
course
of
time
produce
a
nationality
but
that
a
nationality
should
constitute
a
state
is
contrary
to
the
nature
of
modern
civilisation
the
nation
derives
its
rights
and
its
power
from
the
memory
of
a
former
independence
the
church
has
agreed
in
this
respect
with
the
tendency
of
political
progress
and
discouraged
wherever
she
could
the
isolation
of
nations
admonishing
them
of
their
duties
to
each
other
and
regarding
conquest
and
feudal
investiture
as
the
natural
means
of
raising
barbarous
or
sunken
nations
to
a
higher
level
but
though
she
has
never
attributed
to
national
independence
an
immunity
from
the
accidental
consequences
of
feudal
law
of
hereditary
claims
or
of
testamentary
arrangements
she
defends
national
liberty
against
uniformity
and
centralisation
with
an
energy
inspired
by
perfect
community
of
interests
for
the
same
enemy
threatens
both
and
the
state
which
is
reluctant
to
tolerate
differences
and
to
do
justice
to
the
peculiar
character
of
various
races
must
from
the
same
cause
interfere
in
the
internal
government
of
religion
the
connection
of
religious
liberty
with
the
emancipation
of
poland
or
ireland
is
not
merely
the
accidental
result
of
local
causes
and
the
failure
of
the
concordat
to
unite
the
subjects
of
austria
is
the
natural
consequence
of
a
policy
which
did
not
desire
to
protect
the
provinces
in
their
diversity
and
autonomy
and
sought
to
bribe
the
church
by
favours
instead
of
strengthening
her
by
independence
from
this
influence
of
religion
in
modern
history
has
proceeded
a
new
definition
of
patriotism
the
difference
between
nationality
and
the
state
is
exhibited
in
the
nature
of
patriotic
attachment
our
connection
with
the
race
is
merely
natural
or
physical
whilst
our
duties
to
the
political
nation
are
ethical
one
is
a
community
of
affections
and
instincts
infinitely
important
and
powerful
in
savage
life
but
pertaining
more
to
the
animal
than
to
the
civilised
man
the
other
is
an
authority
governing
by
laws
imposing
obligations
and
giving
a
moral
sanction
and
character
to
the
natural
relations
of
society
patriotism
is
in
political
life
what
faith
is
in
religion
and
it
stands
to
the
domestic
feelings
and
to
as
faith
to
fanaticism
and
to
superstition
it
has
one
aspect
derived
from
private
life
and
nature
for
it
is
an
extension
of
the
family
affections
as
the
tribe
is
an
extension
of
the
family
but
in
its
real
political
character
patriotism
consists
in
the
development
of
the
instinct
of
into
a
moral
duty
which
may
involve
is
both
an
instinct
and
a
duty
natural
and
involuntary
in
one
respect
and
at
the
same
time
a
moral
obligation
by
the
first
it
produces
the
family
by
the
last
the
state
if
the
nation
could
exist
without
the
state
subject
only
to
the
instinct
of
it
would
be
incapable
of
denying
controlling
or
sacrificing
itself
it
would
be
an
end
and
a
rule
to
itself
but
in
the
political
order
moral
purposes
are
realised
and
public
ends
are
pursued
to
which
private
interests
and
even
existence
must
be
sacrificed
the
great
sign
of
true
patriotism
the
development
of
selfishness
into
sacrifice
is
the
product
of
political
life
that
sense
of
duty
which
is
supplied
by
race
is
not
entirely
separated
from
its
selfish
and
instinctive
basis
and
the
love
of
country
like
married
love
stands
at
the
same
time
on
a
material
and
a
moral
foundation
the
patriot
must
distinguish
between
the
two
causes
or
objects
of
his
devotion
the
attachment
which
is
given
only
to
the
country
is
like
obedience
given
only
to
the
state
a
submission
to
physical
influences
the
man
who
prefers
his
country
before
every
other
duty
shows
the
same
spirit
as
the
man
who
surrenders
every
right
to
the
state
they
both
deny
that
right
is
superior
to
authority
there
is
a
moral
and
political
country
in
the
language
of
burke
distinct
from
the
geographical
which
may
be
possibly
in
collision
with
it
the
frenchmen
who
bore
arms
against
the
convention
were
as
patriotic
as
the
englishmen
who
bore
arms
against
king
charles

they
recognised
a
higher
duty
than
that

obedience

burke
in
an
attempt
to

with

or
in

any

at
all
relative
to
it
it
is
impossible
we
should
mean
the
geographical
we
must
always
mean
the
moral
and
political
country
the
truth
is
that
france
is
out
of
itself
the
moral
france
is
separated
from
the
geographical
the
master
of
the
house
is
expelled
and
the
robbers
are
in
possession
if
we
look
for
the
corporate
people
of
france
existing
as
corporate
in
the
eye
and
intention
of
public
law
that
corporate
people
i
mean
who
are
free
to
deliberate
and
to
decide
and
who
have
a
capacity

i
am
sure
that
if
half
that

the
same
description

taken
out
of
this
country
it
would
leave
hardly

sentence

which
it
is
not
easy
in
a
translation
to
convey
the
point
qui
pas
une
patrie
a
du
moins
un
pays
and
in
his
tract
on
political
economy
he
writes
how
shall
men
love
their
country
if
it
is
nothing
more
for
them
than
for
strangers
and
bestows
on
them
only
that
which
it
can
refuse
to
none
it
is
in
the
same
sense
he
says
further
on
la
patrie
ne
peut
subsister
sans
la
liberté
the
nationality
formed
by
the
state
then
is
the
only
one
to
which
we
owe
political
duties
and
it
is
therefore
the
only
one
which
has
political
rights
the
swiss
are
ethnologically
either
french
italian
or
german
but
no
nationality
has
the
slightest
claim
upon
them
except
the
purely
political
nationality
of
switzerland
the
tuscan
or
the
neapolitan
state
has
formed
a
nationality
but
the
citizens
of
florence
and
of
naples
have
no
political
community
with
each
other
there
are
other
states
which
have
neither
succeeded
in
absorbing
distinct
races
in
a
political
nationality
nor
in
separating
a
particular
district
from
a
larger
nation
austria
and
mexico
are
instances
on
the
one
hand
parma
and
baden
on
the
other
the
progress
of
civilisation
deals
hardly
with
the
last
description
of
states
in
order
to
maintain
their
integrity
they
must
attach
themselves
by
confederations
or
family
alliances
to
greater
powers
and
thus
lose
something
of
their
independence
their
tendency
is
to
isolate
and
shut
off
their
inhabitants
to
narrow
the
horizon
of
their
views
and
to
dwarf
in
some
degree
the
proportions
of
their
ideas
public
opinion
can
not
maintain
its
liberty
and
purity
in
such
small
dimensions
and
the
currents
that
come
from
larger
communities
sweep
over
a
contracted
territory
in
a
small
and
homogeneous
population
there
is
hardly
room
for
a
natural
classification
of
society
or
for
inner
groups
of
interests
that
set
bounds
to
sovereign
power
the
government
and
the
subjects
contend
with
borrowed
weapons
the
resources
of
the
one
and
the
aspirations
of
the
other
are
derived
from
some
external
source
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
country
becomes
the
instrument
and
the
scene
of
contests
in
which
it
is
not
interested
these
states
like
the
minuter
communities
of
the
middle
ages
serve
a
purpose
by
constituting
partitions
and
securities
of
in
the
larger
states
but
they
are
impediments
to
the
progress
of
society
which
depends
on
the
mixture
of
races
under
the
same
governments
the
vanity
and
peril
of
national
claims
founded
on
no
political
tradition
but
on
race
alone
appear
in
mexico
there
the
races
are
divided
by
blood
without
being
grouped
together
in
different
regions
it
is
therefore
neither
possible
to
unite
them
nor
to
convert
them
into
the
elements
of
an
organised
state
they
are
fluid
shapeless
and
unconnected
and
can
not
be
precipitated
or
formed
into
the
basis
of
political
institutions
as
they
can
not
be
used
by
the
state
they
can
not
be
recognised
by
it
and
their
peculiar
qualities
capabilities
passions
and
attachments
are
of
no
service
and
therefore
obtain
no
regard
they
are
necessarily
ignored
and
are
therefore
perpetually
outraged
from
this
difficulty
of
races
with
political
pretensions
but
without
political
position
the
eastern
world
escaped
by
the
institution
of
castes
where
there
are
only
two
races
there
is
the
resource
of
slavery
but
when
different
races
inhabit
the
different
territories
of
one
empire
composed
of
several
smaller
states
it
is
of
all
possible
combinations
the
most
favourable
to
the
establishment
of
a
highly
developed
system
of
freedom
in
austria
there
are
two
circumstances
which
add
to
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
but
also
increase
its
importance
the
several
nationalities
are
at
very
unequal
degrees
of
advancement
and
there
is
no
single
nation
which
is
so
predominant
as
to
overwhelm
or
absorb
the
others
these
are
the
conditions
necessary
for
the
very
highest
degree
of
organisation
which
government
is
capable
of
receiving
they
supply
the
greatest
variety
of
intellectual
resource
the
perpetual
incentive
to
progress
which
is
afforded
not
merely
by
competition
but
by
the
spectacle
of
a
more
advanced
people
the
most
abundant
elements
of
combined
with
the
impossibility
for
the
state
to
rule
all
by
its
own
will
and
the
fullest
security
for
the
preservation
of
local
customs
and
ancient
rights
in
such
a
country
as
this
liberty
would
achieve
its
most
glorious
results
while
centralisation
and
absolutism
would
be
destruction
the
problem
presented
to
the
government
of
austria
is
higher
than
that
which
is
solved
in
england
because
of
the
necessity
of
admitting
the
national
claims
the
parliamentary
system
fails
to
provide
for
them
as
it
presupposes
the
unity
of
the
people
hence
in
those
countries
in
which
different
races
dwell
together
it
has
not
satisfied
their
desires
and
is
regarded
as
an
imperfect
form
of
freedom
it
brings
out
more
clearly
than
before
the
differences
it
does
not
recognise
and
thus
continues
the
work
of
the
old
absolutism
and
appears
as
a
new
phase
of
centralisation
in
those
countries
therefore
the
power
of
the
imperial
parliament
must
be
limited
as
jealously
as
the
power
of
the
crown
and
many
of
its
functions
must
be
discharged
by
provincial
diets
and
a
descending
series
of
local
authorities
the
great
importance
of
nationality
in
the
state
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
basis
of
political
capacity
the
character
of
a
nation
determines
in
great
measure
the
form
and
vitality
of
the
state
certain
political
habits
and
ideas
belong
to
particular
nations
and
they
vary
with
the
course
of
the
national
history
a
people
just
emerging
from
barbarism
a
people
effete
from
the
excesses
of
a
luxurious
civilisation
can
not
possess
the
means
of
governing
itself
a
people
devoted
to
equality
or
to
absolute
monarchy
is
incapable
of
producing
an
aristocracy
a
people
averse
to
the
institution
of
private
property
is
without
the
first
element
of
freedom
each
of
these
can
be
converted
into
efficient
members
of
a
free
community
only
by
the
contact
of
a
superior
race
in
whose
power
will
lie
the
future
prospects
of
the
state
a
system
which
ignores
these
things
and
does
not
rely
for
its
support
on
the
character
and
aptitude
of
the
people
does
not
intend
that
they
should
administer
their
own
affairs
but
that
they
should
simply
be
obedient
to
the
supreme
command
the
denial
of
nationality
therefore
implies
the
denial
of
political
liberty
the
greatest
adversary
of
the
rights
of
nationality
is
the
modern
theory
of
nationality
by
making
the
state
and
the
nation
commensurate
with
each
other
in
theory
it
reduces
practically
to
a
subject
condition
all
other
nationalities
that
may
be
within
the
boundary
it
can
not
admit
them
to
an
equality
with
the
ruling
nation
which
constitutes
the
state
because
the
state
would
then
cease
to
be
national
which
would
be
a
contradiction
of
the
principle
of
its
existence
according
therefore
to
the
degree
of
humanity
and
civilisation
in
that
dominant
body
which
claims
all
the
rights
of
the
community
the
inferior
races
are
exterminated
or
reduced
to
servitude
or
outlawed
or
put
in
a
condition
of
dependence
if
we
take
the
establishment
of
liberty
for
the
realisation
of
moral
duties
to
be
the
end
of
civil
society
we
must
conclude
that
those
states
are
substantially
the
most
perfect
which
like
the
british
and
austrian
empires
include
various
distinct
nationalities
without
oppressing
them
those
in
which
no
mixture
of
races
has
occurred
are
imperfect
and
those
in
which
its
effects
have
disappeared
are
decrepit
a
state
which
is
incompetent
to
satisfy
different
races
condemns
itself
a
state
which
labours
to
neutralise
to
absorb
or
to
expel
them
destroys
its
own
vitality
a
state
which
does
not
include
them
is
destitute
of
the
chief
basis
of
the
theory
of
nationality
therefore
is
a
retrograde
step
in
history
it
is
the
most
advanced
form
of
the
revolution
and
must
retain
its
power
to
the
end
of
the
revolutionary
period
of
which
it
announces
the
approach
its
great
historical
importance
depends
on
two
chief
causes
first
it
is
a
chimera
the
settlement
at
which
it
aims
is
impossible
as
it
can
never
be
satisfied
and
exhausted
and
always
continues
to
assert
itself
it
prevents
the
government
from
ever
relapsing
into
the
condition
which
provoked
its
rise
the
danger
is
too
threatening
and
the
power
over
men
minds
too
great
to
allow
any
system
to
endure
which
justifies
the
resistance
of
nationality
it
must
contribute
therefore
to
obtain
that
which
in
theory
it
condemns
the
liberty
of
different
nationalities
as
members
of
one
sovereign
community
this
is
a
service
which
no
other
force
could
accomplish
for
it
is
a
corrective
alike
of
absolute
monarchy
of
democracy
and
of
constitutionalism
as
well
as
of
the
centralisation
which
is
common
to
all
three
neither
the
monarchical
nor
the
revolutionary
nor
the
parliamentary
system
can
do
this
and
all
the
ideas
which
have
excited
enthusiasm
in
past
times
are
impotent
for
the
purpose
except
nationality
alone
and
secondly
the
national
theory
marks
the
end
of
the
revolutionary
doctrine
and
its
logical
exhaustion
in
proclaiming
the
supremacy
of
the
rights
of
nationality
the
system
of
democratic
equality
goes
beyond
its
own
extreme
boundary
and
falls
into
contradiction
with
itself
between
the
democratic
and
the
national
phase
of
the
revolution
socialism
had
intervened
and
had
already
carried
the
consequences
of
the
principle
to
an
absurdity
but
that
phase
was
passed
the
revolution
survived
its
offspring
and
produced
another
further
result
nationality
is
more
advanced
than
socialism
because
it
is
a
more
arbitrary
system
the
social
theory
endeavours
to
provide
for
the
existence
of
the
individual
beneath
the
terrible
burdens
which
modern
society
heaps
upon
labour
it
is
not
merely
a
development
of
the
notion
of
equality
but
a
refuge
from
real
misery
and
starvation
however
false
the
solution
it
was
a
reasonable
demand
that
the
poor
should
be
saved
from
destruction
and
if
the
freedom
of
the
state
was
sacrificed
to
the
safety
of
the
individual
the
more
immediate
object
was
at
least
in
theory
attained
but
nationality
does
not
aim
either
at
liberty
or
prosperity
both
of
which
it
sacrifices
to
the
imperative
necessity
of
making
the
nation
the
mould
and
measure
of
the
state
its
course
will
be
marked
with
material
as
well
as
moral
ruin
in
order
that
a
new
invention
may
prevail
over
the
works
of
god
and
the
interests
of
mankind
there
is
no
principle
of
change
no
phase
of
political
speculation
conceivable
more
comprehensive
more
subversive
or
more
arbitrary
than
this
it
is
a
confutation
of
democracy
because
it
sets
limits
to
the
exercise
of
the
popular
will
and
substitutes
for
it
a
higher
principle
it
prevents
not
only
the
division
but
the
extension
of
the
state
and
forbids
to
terminate
war
by
conquest
and
to
obtain
a
security
for
peace
thus
after
surrendering
the
individual
to
the
collective
will
the
revolutionary
system
makes
the
collective
will
subject
to
conditions
which
are
independent
of
it
and
rejects
all
law
only
to
be
controlled
by
an
accident
although
therefore
the
theory
of
nationality
is
more
absurd
and
more
criminal
than
the
theory
of
socialism
it
has
an
important
mission
in
the
world
and
marks
the
final
conflict
and
therefore
the
end
of
two
forces
which
are
the
worst
enemies
of
civil
freedom
the
absolute
monarchy
and
the

not
appear
that
although
the
argument
of
the
lecturer
was
lost
his
meaning
was
not
on
the
whole
seriously
misrepresented
excepting
for
the
sake
of
the
author
who
became
the
object
and
of
those
who
unfortunately
made
themselves
the
organs
of
so
much
calumny
it
is
impossible
to
lament
the
existence
of
the
erroneous
statements
which
have
caused
the
present
publication
intending
at
first
to
prefix
an
introduction
to
the
text
of
his
lectures
the
professor
has
been
led
on
by
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
the
extent
of
his
subject
and
the
abundance
of
materials
to
compose
a
book
of
pages
written
with
all
the
author
perspicuity
of
style
though
without
his
usual
compression
with
the
exhaustless
information
which
never
fails
him
but
with
an
economy
of
quotation
suited
to
the
general
public
for
whom
it
is
designed
it
betrays
the
circumstances
of
its
origin
subjects
are
sometimes
introduced
out
of
their
proper
place
and
order
and
there
are
occasional
repetitions
which
show
that
he
had
not
at
starting
fixed
the
proportions
of
the
different
parts
of
his
work
this
does
not
however
affect
the
logical
sequence
of
the
ideas
or
the
accuracy
of
the
induction
no
other
book
contains
no
other
writer
probably
could
supply
so
comprehensive
and
so
suggestive
a
description
of
the
state
of
the
protestant
religion
or
so
impartial
an
account
of
the
causes
which
have
brought
on
the
crisis
of
the
temporal
power
the
of
möhler
was
suggested
by
the
beginning
of
that
movement
of
revival
and
resuscitation
amongst
the
protestants
of
which
döllinger
now
surveys
the
fortunes
and
the
result
the
interval
of
thirty
years
has
greatly
altered
the
position
of
the
catholic
divines
towards
their
antagonists
möhler
had
to
deal
with
the
ideas
of
the
reformation
the
works
of
the
reformers
and
the
teaching
of
the
confessions
he
had
to
answer
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
theology
of
the
sixteenth
the
protestantism
for
which
he
wrote
was
a
complete
system
antagonistic
to
the
whole
of
catholic
theology
and
he
confuted
the
one
by
comparing
it
with
the
other
dogma
for
dogma
but
that
of
which
döllinger
treats
has
lost
for
the
most
part
those
distinctive
doctrines
not
by
the
growth
of
unbelief
but
in
consequence
of
the
very
efforts
which
its
most
zealous
and
religious
professors
have
made
to
defend
and
to
redeem
it
the
contradictions
and
errors
of
the
protestant
belief
were
formerly
the
subject
of
controversy
with
its
catholic
opponents
but
now
the
controversy
is
anticipated
and
prevented
by
the
undisguised
admissions
of
its
desponding
friends
it
stands
no
longer
as
a
system
consistent
complete
satisfying
the
judgment
and
commanding
the
unconditional
allegiance
of
its
followers
and
fortified
at
all
points
against
catholicism
but
disorganised
as
a
church
its
doctrines
in
a
state
of
dissolution
despaired
of
by
its
divines
strong
and
compact
only
in
its
hostility
to
rome
but
with
no
positive
principle
of
unity
no
ground
of
resistance
nothing
to
have
faith
in
but
the
determination
to
reject
authority
this
therefore
is
the
point
which
döllinger
takes
up
reducing
the
chief
phenomena
of
religious
and
social
decline
to
the
one
head
of
failing
authority
he
founds
on
the
state
of
protestantism
the
apology
of
the
papacy
he
abandons
to
the
protestant
theology
the
destruction
of
the
protestant
church
and
leaves
its
divines
to
confute
and
abjure
its
principles
in
detail
and
to
arrive
by
the
exhaustion
of
the
modes
of
error
through
a
painful
but
honourable
process
at
the
gates
of
truth
he
meets
their
arguments
simply
by
a
chapter
of
ecclesiastical
history
of
which
experience
teaches
them
the
force
and
he
opposes
to
their
theories
not
the
discussions
of
controversial
theology
but
the
character
of
a
single
institution
the
opportunity
he
has
taken
to
do
this
the
assumed
coincidence
between
the
process
of
dissolution
among
the
protestants
and
the
process
of
regeneration
in
the
court
of
rome
is
the
characteristic
peculiarity
of
the
book
before
we
proceed
to
give
an
analysis
of
its
contents
we
will
give
some
extracts
from
the
preface
which
explains
the
purpose
of
the
whole
and
which
is
alone
one
of
the
most
important
contributions
to
the
religious
discussions
of
the
day
this
book
arose
from
two
out
of
four
lectures
which
were
delivered
in
april
this
year
how
i
came
to
discuss
the
most
difficult
and
complicated
question
of
our
time
before
a
very
mixed
audience
and
in
a
manner
widely
different
from
that
usually
adopted
i
deem
myself
bound
to
explain
it
was
my
intention
when
i
was
first
requested
to
lecture
only
to
speak
of
the
present
state
of
religion
in
general
with
a
comprehensive
view
extending
over
all
mankind
it
happened
however
that
from
those
circles
which
had
given
the
impulse
to
the
lectures
the
question
was
frequently
put
to
me
how
the
position
of
the
holy
see
the
partly
consummated
partly
threatening
loss
of
its
secular
power
is
to
be
explained
what
answer
i
was
repeatedly
asked
is
to
be
given
to
those
out
of
the
church
who
point
with
triumphant
scorn
to
the
numerous
episcopal
manifestoes
in
which
the
states
of
the
church
are
declared
essential
and
necessary
to
her
existence
although
the
events
of
the
last
thirty
years
appear
with
increasing
distinctness
to
announce
their
downfall
i
had
found
the
hope
often
expressed
in
newspapers
books
and
periodicals
that
after
the
destruction
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
popes
the
church
herself
would
not
escape
dissolution
at
the
same
time
i
was
struck
by
finding
in
the
memoirs
of
chateaubriand
that
cardinal
bernetti
secretary
of
state
to
leo
had
said
that
if
he
lived
long
there
was
a
chance
of
his
beholding
the
fall
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
papacy
i
had
also
read
in
the
letter
of
a
and
trustworthy
correspondent
from
paris
that
the
archbishop
of
rheims
had
related
on
his
return
from
rome
that
pius
ix
had
said
to
him
i
am
under
no
illusions
the
temporal
power
must
fall
goyon
will
abandon
me
i
shall
then
disband
my
remaining
troops
i
shall
excommunicate
the
king
when
he
enters
the
city
and
shall
calmly
await
my
death
i
thought
already
in
april
that
i
could
perceive
what
has
become
still
more
clear
in
october
that
the
enemies
of
the
secular
power
of
the
papacy
are
determined
united
predominant
and
that
there
is
nowhere
a
protecting
power
which
possesses
the
will
and
at
the
same
time
the
means
of
averting
the
catastrophe
i
considered
it
therefore
probable
that
an
interruption
of
the
temporal
dominion
would
soon
ensue
an
interruption
which
like
others
before
it
would
also
come
to
an
end
and
would
be
followed
by
a
restoration
i
resolved
therefore
to
take
the
opportunity
which
the
lectures
gave
me
to
prepare
the
public
for
the
coming
events
which
already
cast
their
shadows
upon
us
and
thus
to
prevent
the
scandals
the
doubt
and
the
offence
which
must
inevitably
arise
if
the
states
of
the
church
should
pass
into
other
hands
although
the
pastorals
of
the
bishops
had
so
energetically
asserted
that
they
belonged
to
the
integrity
of
the
church
i
meant
therefore
to
say
the
church
by
her
nature
can
very
well
exist
and
did
exist
for
seven
centuries
without
the
territorial
possessions
of
the
popes
afterwards
this
possession
became
necessary
and
in
spite
of
great
changes
and
vicissitudes
has
discharged
in
most
cases
its
function
of
serving
as
a
foundation
for
the
independence
and
freedom
of
the
popes
as
long
as
the
present
state
and
arrangement
of
europe
endures
we
can
discover
no
other
means
to
secure
to
the
holy
see
its
freedom
and
with
it
the
confidence
of
all
but
the
knowledge
and
the
power
of
god
reach
farther
than
ours
and
we
must
not
presume
to
set
bounds
to
the
divine
wisdom
and
omnipotence
or
to
say
to
it
in
this
way
and
no
other
should
nevertheless
the
threatening
consummation
ensue
and
should
the
pope
be
robbed
of
his
land
one
of
three
eventualities
will
assuredly
come
to
pass
either
the
loss
of
the
state
is
only
temporary
and
the
territory
will
revert
after
some
intervening
casualties
either
whole
or
in
part
to
its
legitimate
sovereign
or
providence
will
bring
about
by
ways
unknown
to
us
and
combinations
which
we
can
not
divine
a
state
of
things
in
which
the
object
namely
the
independence
and
free
action
of
the
holy
see
will
be
attained
without
the
means
which
have
hitherto
served
or
else
we
are
approaching
great
catastrophes
in
europe
the
doom
of
the
whole
edifice
of
the
present
social
order
events
of
which
the
ruin
of
the
roman
state
is
only
the
precursor
and
the
herald
the
reasons
for
which
of
these
three
possibilities
i
think
the
first
the
most
probable
i
have
developed
in
this
book
concerning
the
second
alternative
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
it
is
an
unknown
and
therefore
indescribable
quantity
only
we
must
retain
it
against
certain
assertions
which
profess
to
know
the
secret
things
to
come
and
trespassing
on
the
divine
domain
wish
to
subject
the
future
absolutely
to
the
laws
of
the
immediate
past
that
the
third
possibility
must
also
be
admitted
few
of
those
who
studiously
observe
the
signs
of
the
time
will
dispute
one
of
the
ablest
historians
and
statesmen
niebuhr
wrote
on
the
october
if
god
does
not
miraculously
aid
a
destruction
is
in
store
for
us
such
as
the
roman
world
underwent
in
the
middle
of
the
third
century
destruction
of
prosperity
of
freedom
of
civilisation
and
of
literature
and
we
have
proceeded
much
farther
on
the
inclined
plane
since
then
the
european
powers
have
overturned
or
have
allowed
to
be
overturned
the
two
pillars
of
their
existence
the
principle
of
legitimacy
and
the
public
law
of
nations
those
monarchs
who
have
made
themselves
the
slaves
of
the
revolution
to
do
its
work
are
the
active
agents
in
the
historical
drama
the
others
stand
aside
as
quiet
spectators
in
expectation
of
inheriting
something
like
prussia
and
russia
or
bestowing
encouragement
and
assistance
like
england
or
as
passive
invalids
like
austria
and
the
sinking
empire
of
turkey
but
the
revolution
is
a
permanent
chronic
disease
breaking
out
now
in
one
place
now
in
another
sometimes
seizing
several
members
together
the
pentarchy
is
dissolved
the
holy
alliance
which
however
defective
or
open
to
abuse
was
one
form
of
political
order
is
buried
the
right
of
might
prevails
in
europe
is
it
a
process
of
renovation
or
a
process
of
dissolution
in
which
european
society
is
plunged
i
still
think
the
former
but
i
must
as
i
have
said
admit
the
possibility
of
the
other
alternative
if
it
occurs
then
when
the
powers
of
destruction
have
done
their
work
it
will
be
the
business
of
the
church
at
once
to
actively
in
the
reconstruction
of
social
order
out
of
the
ruins
both
as
a
connecting
civilising
power
and
as
the
preserver
and
dispenser
of
moral
and
religious
tradition
and
thus
the
papacy
with
or
without
territory
has
its
own
function
and
its
appointed
mission
these
then
were
the
ideas
from
which
i
started
and
it
may
be
supposed
that
my
language
concerning
the
immediate
fate
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
necessarily
sounded
ambiguous
that
i
could
not
well
come
with
the
confidence
which
is
given
to
other
perhaps
more
men
before
my
audience
and
say
rely
upon
it
the
states
of
the
church
the
land
from
radicofani
to
ceperano
from
ravenna
to
cività
vecchia
shall
and
must
and
will
invariably
remain
to
the
popes
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
away
before
the
roman
state
shall
pass
away
i
could
not
do
this
because
i
did
not
at
that
time
believe
it
nor
do
i
now
but
am
only
confident
that
the
holy
see
will
not
be
permanently
deprived
of
the
conditions
necessary
for
the
fulfilment
of
its
mission
thus
the
substance
of
my
words
was
this
let
no
one
lose
faith
in
the
church
if
the
secular
principality
of
the
pope
should
disappear
for
a
season
or
for
ever
it
is
not
essence
but
accident
not
end
but
means
it
began
late
it
was
formerly
something
quite
different
from
what
it
is
now
it
justly
appears
to
us
indispensable
and
as
long
as
the
existing
order
lasts
in
europe
it
must
be
maintained
at
any
price
or
if
it
is
violently
interrupted
it
must
be
restored
but
a
political
settlement
of
europe
is
conceivable
in
which
it
would
be
superfluous
and
then
it
would
be
an
oppressive
burden
at
the
same
time
i
wished
to
defend
pope
pius
ix
and
his
government
against
many
accusations
and
to
point
out
that
the
inward
infirmities
and
deficiencies
which
undeniably
exist
in
the
country
by
which
the
state
has
been
reduced
to
so
deplorable
a
condition
of
weakness
and
helplessness
were
not
attributable
to
him
that
on
the
contrary
he
has
shown
both
before
and
since
the
best
will
to
reform
and
that
by
him
and
under
him
much
has
been
really
improved
the
newspaper
reports
written
down
at
home
from
memory
gave
but
an
inaccurate
representation
of
a
discourse
which
did
not
attempt
in
the
usual
way
to
cut
the
knot
but
which
with
buts
and
ifs
and
referring
to
certain
elements
in
the
decision
which
are
generally
left
out
of
the
calculation
spoke
of
an
uncertain
future
and
of
various
possibilities
this
was
not
to
be
avoided
any
reproduction
which
was
not
quite
literal
must
in
spite
of
the
good
intentions
of
the
reporter
have
given
rise
to
false
interpretations
when
therefore
one
of
the
most
widely
read
papers
reported
the
first
lecture
without
any
intentional
falsification
but
with
omissions
which
altered
the
sense
and
the
tendency
of
my
words
i
immediately
proposed
to
the
conductors
to
print
my
manuscript
but
this
offer
was
declined
in
other
accounts
in
the
daily
press
i
was
often
unable
to
recognise
my
ideas
and
words
were
put
into
my
mouth
which
i
had
never
uttered
and
here
i
will
admit
that
when
i
gave
the
lectures
i
did
not
think
that
they
would
be
discussed
by
the
press
but
expected
that
like
others
of
the
same
kind
they
would
at
most
be
mentioned
in
a
couple
of
words
futuram
of
the
controversy
which
sprang
up
at
once
in
separate
works
and
in
newspaper
articles
in
germany
france
england
italy
and
even
in
america
i
shall
not
speak
much
of
it
i
have
not
read
the
writers
often
did
not
even
ask
themselves
whether
the
report
which
accident
put
into
their
hands
and
which
they
carelessly
adopted
was
at
all
accurate
but
i
must
refer
to
an
account
in
one
of
the
most
popular
english
periodicals
because
i
am
there
brought
into
a
society
to
which
i
do
not
belong
the
author
of
an
article
in
the
july
number
of
the
appeals
to
me
misunderstanding
the
drift
of
my
words
and
erroneously
believing
that
i
had
already
published
an
apology
of
my
orthodoxy
a
sharp
attack
upon
me
in
the
i
know
only
from
extracts
in
english
papers
but
i
can
see
from
the
vehemence
with
which
the
writer
pronounces
himself
against
liberal
institutions
that
even
after
the
appearance
of
this
book
i
can
not
reckon
on
coming
to
an
understanding
with
him
the
excitement
which
was
caused
by
my
lectures
or
rather
by
the
accounts
of
them
in
the
papers
had
this
advantage
that
it
brought
to
light
in
a
way
which
to
many
was
unexpected
how
widely
how
deeply
and
how
firmly
the
attachment
of
the
people
to
the
see
of
st
peter
is
rooted
for
the
sake
of
this
i
was
glad
to
accept
all
the
attacks
and
animosity
which
fell
on
me
in
consequence
but
why
it
will
be
asked
and
i
have
been
asked
innumerable
times
why
not
cut
short
misunderstandings
by
the
immediate
publication
of
the
lectures
which
must
as
a
whole
have
been
written
beforehand
why
wait
for
five
months
for
this
i
had
two
reasons
first
it
was
not
merely
a
question
of
misunderstanding
much
of
what
i
had
actually
said
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
in
many
quarters
especially
among
our
optimists
i
should
therefore
with
my
bare
statements
have
become
involved
in
an
agitating
discussion
in
pamphlets
and
newspapers
and
that
was
not
an
attractive
prospect
the
second
reason
was
this
i
expected
that
the
further
progress
of
events
in
italy
the
irresistible
logic
of
facts
would
dispose
minds
to
receive
certain
truths
i
hoped
that
people
would
learn
by
degrees
in
the
school
of
events
that
it
is
not
enough
always
to
be
reckoning
with
the
figures
revolution
secret
societies
mazzinism
atheism
or
to
estimate
things
only
by
the
standard
supplied
by
the
jew
of
verona
but
that
other
factors
must
be
admitted
into
the
calculation
for
instance
the
condition
of
the
italian
clergy
and
its
position
towards
the
laity
i
wished
therefore
to
let
a
few
months
go
by
before
i
came
before
the
public
whether
i
judged
rightly
the
reception
of
this
book
will
show
i
thoroughly
understand
those
who
think
it
censurable
that
i
should
have
spoken
in
detail
of
situations
and
facts
which
are
gladly
ignored
or
touched
with
a
light
and
hasty
hand
and
that
especially
at
the
present
crisis
i
myself
was
restrained
for
ten
years
by
these
considerations
in
spite
of
the
feeling
which
urged
me
to
speak
on
the
question
of
the
roman
government
and
it
required
the
circumstances
i
have
described
i
may
almost
say
to
compel
me
to
speak
publicly
on
the
subject
i
beg
of
these
persons
to
weigh
the
following
points
first
when
an
author
openly
exposes
a
state
of
things
already
abundantly
discussed
in
the
press
if
he
draws
away
the
necessarily
very
transparent
covering
from
the
gaping
wounds
which
are
not
on
the
church
herself
but
on
an
institution
nearly
connected
with
her
and
whose
infirmities
she
is
made
to
feel
it
may
fairly
be
supposed
that
he
does
it
in
agreement
with
the
example
of
earlier
friends
and
great
men
of
the
church
only
to
show
the
possibility
and
the
necessity
of
the
cure
in
order
so
far
as
in
him
lies
to
weaken
the
reproach
that
the
defenders
of
the
church
see
only
the
mote
in
the
eyes
of
others
not
the
beam
in
their
own
and
with
prejudice
endeavour
to
soften
or
to
dissimulate
or
to
deny
every
fact
which
is
or
which
appears
unfavourable
to
their
cause
he
does
it
in
order
that
it
may
be
understood
that
where
the
powerlessness
of
men
to
effect
a
cure
becomes
manifest
god
interposes
in
order
to
sift
on
his
the
chaff
from
the
wheat
and
to
consume
it
with
the
fire
of
the
catastrophes
which
are
only
his
judgments
and
remedies
secondly
i
could
not
as
a
historian
present
the
effects
without
going
back
to
their
causes
and
it
was
therefore
my
duty
as
it
is
that
of
every
religious
inquirer
and
observer
to
try
to
contribute
something
to
the
he
that
undertakes
to
write
on
such
lofty
interests
which
nearly
affect
the
weal
and
woe
of
the
church
can
not
avoid
examining
and
displaying
the
wisdom
and
justice
of
god
in
the
conduct
of
terrestrial
events
regarding
them
the
fate
which
has
overtaken
the
roman
states
must
above
all
be
considered
in
the
light
of
a
divine
ordinance
for
the
advantage
of
the
church
seen
by
that
light
it
assumes
the
character
of
a
trial
which
will
continue
until
the
object
is
attained
and
the
welfare
of
the
church
so
far
secured
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
as
a
new
order
of
things
in
europe
lies
in
the
design
of
providence
the
disease
through
which
for
the
last
the
states
of
the
church
unquestionably
have
passed
might
be
the
transition
to
a
new
form
to
describe
this
malady
without
overlooking
or
concealing
any
of
the
symptoms
was
therefore
an
undertaking
which
i
could
not
avoid
the
disease
has
its
source
in
the
inward
contradiction
and
discord
of
the
institutions
and
conditions
of
the
government
for
the
modern
french
institutions
stand
there
without
any
reconciling
qualifications
besides
those
of
the
mediæval
hierarchy
neither
of
these
elements
is
strong
enough
to
expel
the
other
and
either
of
them
would
if
it
prevailed
alone
be
again
a
form
of
disease
yet
in
the
history
of
the
last
few
years
i
recognise
symptoms
of
convalescence
however
feeble
obscure
and
equivocal
its
traces
may
appear
what
we
behold
is
not
death
or
hopeless
decay
it
is
a
purifying
process
painful
consuming
penetrating
bone
and
marrow
such
as
god
inflicts
on
his
chosen
persons
and
institutions
there
is
abundance
of
dross
and
time
is
necessary
before
the
gold
can
come
pure
out
of
the
furnace
in
the
course
of
this
process
it
may
happen
that
the
territorial
dominion
will
be
interrupted
that
the
state
may
be
broken
up
or
pass
into
other
hands
but
it
will
revive
though
perhaps
in
another
form
and
with
a
different
kind
of
government
in
a
word
laboramus
that
is
what
i
wished
to
show
that
i
believe
i
have
shown
now
and
for
the
last
forty
years
the
condition
of
the
roman
states
is
the
heel
of
achilles
of
the
catholic
church
the
standing
reproach
for
adversaries
throughout
the
world
and
a
for
thousands
not
as
though
the
objections
which
are
founded
on
the
fact
of
this
transitory
disturbance
and
discord
in
the
social
and
political
sphere
possessed
any
weight
in
a
theological
point
of
view
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
they
are
of
incalculable
influence
on
the
disposition
of
the
world
external
to
the
church
whenever
a
state
of
disease
has
appeared
in
the
church
there
has
been
but
one
method
of
cure
that
of
an
awakened
renovated
healthy
consciousness
and
of
an
enlightened
public
opinion
in
the
church
the
goodwill
of
the
ecclesiastical
rulers
and
heads
has
not
been
able
to
accomplish
the
cure
unless
sustained
by
the
general
sense
and
conviction
of
the
clergy
and
of
the
laity
the
healing
of
the
great
malady
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
true
internal
reformation
of
the
church
only
became
possible
when
people
ceased
to
disguise
or
to
deny
the
evil
and
to
pass
it
by
with
silence
and
concealment
when
so
powerful
and
irresistible
a
public
opinion
had
formed
itself
in
the
church
that
its
commanding
influence
could
no
longer
be
evaded
at
the
present
day
what
we
want
is
the
whole
truth
not
merely
the
perception
that
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
is
required
by
the
church
for
that
is
obvious
to
everybody
at
least
out
of
italy
and
everything
has
been
said
that
can
be
said
about
it
but
also
the
knowledge
of
the
conditions
under
which
this
power
is
possible
for
the
future
the
history
of
the
popes
is
full
of
instances
where
their
best
intentions
were
not
fulfilled
and
their
strongest
resolutions
broke
down
because
the
interests
of
a
firmly
compacted
class
resisted
like
an
impenetrable
hedge
of
thorns
hadrian
vi
was
fully
resolved
to
set
about
the
reformation
in
earnest
and
yet
he
achieved
virtually
nothing
and
felt
himself
though
in
possession
of
supreme
power
altogether
powerless
against
the
passive
resistance
of
all
those
who
should
have
been
his
instruments
in
the
work
only
when
public
opinion
even
in
italy
and
in
rome
itself
was
awakened
purified
and
strengthened
when
the
cry
for
reform
resounded
imperatively
on
every
side
then
only
was
it
possible
for
the
popes
to
overcome
the
resistance
in
the
inferior
spheres
and
gradually
and
step
by
step
to
open
the
way
for
a
more
healthy
state
may
therefore
a
powerful
healthy
unanimous
public
opinion
in
catholic
europe
come
to
the
aid
of
pius
concerning
another
part
of
this
book
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
i
have
given
a
survey
of
all
the
churches
and
ecclesiastical
communities
now
existing
the
obligation
of
attempting
this
presented
itself
to
me
because
i
had
to
explain
both
the
universal
importance
of
the
papacy
as
a
power
for
all
the
world
and
the
things
which
it
actually
performs
this
could
not
be
done
fully
without
exhibiting
the
internal
condition
of
the
churches
which
have
rejected
it
and
withdrawn
from
its
influence
it
is
true
that
the
plan
increased
under
my
hands
and
i
endeavoured
to
give
as
clear
a
picture
as
possible
of
the
development
which
has
accomplished
itself
in
the
separated
churches
since
the
reformation
and
through
it
in
consequence
of
the
views
and
principles
which
had
been
once
for
all
adopted
i
have
therefore
admitted
into
my
description
no
feature
which
is
not
in
my
opinion
an
effect
a
result
however
remote
of
those
principles
and
doctrines
there
is
doubtless
room
for
discussion
in
detail
upon
this
point
and
there
will
unavoidably
be
a
decided
opposition
to
this
book
if
it
should
be
noticed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
church
to
which
i
belong
i
hope
that
there
also
the
justice
will
be
done
me
of
believing
that
i
was
far
from
having
any
intention
of
offending
that
i
have
only
said
what
must
be
said
if
we
would
go
to
the
bottom
of
these
questions
that
i
had
to
do
with
institutions
which
because
of
the
dogmas
and
principles
from
which
they
spring
must
like
a
tree
that
is
nailed
to
a
wall
remain
in
one
position
however
unnatural
it
may
be
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
on
the
opposite
side
the
men
are
often
better
than
the
system
to
which
they
are
or
deem
themselves
attached
and
that
on
the
contrary
in
the
church
the
individuals
are
on
the
average
inferior
in
theory
and
in
practice
to
the
system
under
which
they
live
the
union
of
the
two
religions
which
would
be
socially
and
politically
the
salvation
of
germany
and
of
europe
is
not
possible
at
present
first
because
the
greater
more
active
and
more
influential
portion
of
the
german
protestants
do
not
desire
it
for
political
or
religious
reasons
in
any
form
or
under
any
practicable
conditions
it
is
impossible
secondly
because
negotiations
concerning
the
mode
and
the
conditions
of
union
can
no
longer
be
carried
on
for
this
plenipotentiaries
on
both
sides
are
required
and
these
only
the
catholic
church
is
able
to
appoint
by
virtue
of
her
ecclesiastical
organisation
not
the
protestants
nevertheless
theologically
protestants
and
catholics
have
come
nearer
each
other
for
those
capital
doctrines
those
articles
with
which
the
church
was
to
stand
or
fall
for
the
sake
of
which
the
reformers
declared
separation
from
the
catholic
church
to
be
necessary
are
now
confuted
and
given
up
by
protestant
theology
or
are
retained
only
nominally
whilst
other
notions
are
connected
with
the
words
protestant
theology
is
at
the
present
day
less
hostile
so
to
speak
than
the
theologians
for
whilst
theology
has
levelled
the
strongest
bulwarks
and
doctrinal
barriers
which
the
reformation
had
set
up
to
confirm
the
separation
the
divines
instead
of
viewing
favourably
the
consequent
facilities
for
union
often
labour
on
the
contrary
to
conceal
the
fact
or
to
provide
new
points
of
difference
many
of
them
probably
agree
with
stahl
of
berlin
who
said
shortly
before
his
death
far
from
supposing
that
the
breach
of
the
sixteenth
century
can
be
healed
we
ought
if
it
had
not
already
occurred
to
make
it
now
this
however
will
not
continue
and
a
future
generation
perhaps
that
which
is
even
now
growing
up
will
rather
adopt
the
recent
declaration
of
heinrich
leo
in
the
roman
catholic
church
a
process
of
purification
has
taken
place
since
luther
day
and
if
the
church
had
been
in
the
days
of
luther
what
the
roman
catholic
church
in
germany
actually
is
at
present
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
to
assert
his
opposition
so
energetically
as
to
bring
about
a
separation
those
who
think
thus
will
then
be
the
right
men
and
the
chosen
instruments
for
the
acceptable
work
of
the
reconciliation
of
the
churches
and
the
true
unity
of
germany
upon
the
day
when
on
both
sides
the
conviction
shall
arise
vivid
and
strong
that
christ
really
desires
the
unity
of
his
church
that
the
division
of
christendom
the
multiplicity
of
churches
is
displeasing
to
god
that
he
who
helps
to
prolong
the
situation
must
answer
for
it
to
the
lord
on
that
day
of
the
traditional
polemics
of
the
protestants
against
the
church
will
with
one
blow
be
set
aside
like
chaff
and
rubbish
for
consist
of
misunderstandings
logomachies
and
wilful
falsifications
or
relate
to
personal
and
therefore
accidental
things
which
are
utterly
insignificant
where
only
principles
and
dogmas
are
at
stake
on
that
day
also
much
will
be
changed
on
the
catholic
side
thenceforward
the
character
of
luther
and
the
reformers
will
no
more
be
dragged
forward
in
the
pulpit
the
clergy
mindful
of
the
saying
errores
diligite
will
always
conduct
themselves
towards
members
of
other
churches
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
charity
and
will
therefore
assume
in
all
cases
where
there
are
no
clear
proofs
to
the
contrary
the
of
opponents
they
will
never
forget
that
no
man
is
convinced
and
won
over
by
bitter
words
and
violent
attacks
but
that
every
one
is
rather
repelled
by
them
warned
by
the
words
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
xiv
they
will
be
more
careful
than
heretofore
to
give
to
their
separate
brethren
no
scandal
no
grounds
of
accusation
against
the
church
accordingly
in
popular
instruction
and
in
religious
life
they
will
always
make
the
great
truths
of
salvation
the
centre
of
all
their
teaching
they
will
not
treat
secondary
things
in
life
and
doctrine
as
though
they
were
of
the
first
importance
but
on
the
contrary
they
will
keep
alive
in
the
people
the
consciousness
that
such
things
are
but
means
to
an
end
and
are
only
of
inferior
consequence
and
subsidiary
value
until
that
day
shall
dawn
upon
germany
it
is
our
duty
as
catholics
in
the
words
of
cardinal
diepenbrock
to
bear
the
religious
separation
in
a
spirit
of
penance
for
guilt
incurred
in
common
we
must
acknowledge
that
here
also
god
has
caused
much
good
as
well
as
much
evil
to
proceed
from
the
errors
of
men
from
the
contests
and
passions
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
the
anxiety
of
the
german
nation
to
see
the
intolerable
abuses
and
scandals
in
the
church
removed
was
fully
justified
and
sprang
from
the
better
qualities
of
our
people
and
from
their
moral
indignation
at
the
desecration
and
corruption
of
holy
things
which
were
degraded
to
selfish
and
hypocritical
purposes
we
do
not
refuse
to
admit
that
the
great
separation
and
the
storms
and
sufferings
connected
with
it
was
an
awful
judgment
upon
catholic
christendom
which
clergy
and
laity
had
but
too
well
deserved
a
judgment
which
has
had
an
improving
and
salutary
effect
the
great
conflict
of
intellects
has
purified
the
european
atmosphere
has
impelled
the
human
mind
on
to
new
courses
and
has
promoted
a
rich
scientific
and
literary
life
protestant
theology
with
its
restless
spirit
of
inquiry
has
gone
along
by
the
side
of
the
catholic
exciting
and
awakening
warning
and
vivifying
and
every
eminent
catholic
divine
in
germany
will
gladly
admit
that
he
owes
much
to
the
writings
of
protestant
scholars
we
must
also
acknowledge
that
in
the
church
the
rust
of
abuses
and
of
a
mechanical
superstition
is
always
forming
afresh
that
the
spiritual
in
religion
is
sometimes
materialised
and
therefore
degraded
deformed
and
applied
to
their
own
loss
by
the
servants
of
the
church
through
their
indolence
and
want
of
intelligence
and
by
the
people
through
their
ignorance
the
true
spirit
of
reform
most
therefore
never
depart
from
the
church
but
must
periodically
break
out
with
renovating
strength
and
penetrate
the
mind
and
the
will
of
the
clergy
in
this
sense
we
do
not
refuse
to
admit
the
justice
of
a
call
to
penance
when
it
proceeds
from
those
who
are
not
of
us
that
is
of
a
warning
carefully
to
examine
our
religious
life
and
pastoral
conduct
and
to
remedy
what
is
found
defective
at
the
same
time
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
separation
did
not
ensue
in
consequence
of
the
abuses
of
the
church
for
the
duty
and
necessity
of
removing
these
abuses
has
always
been
recognised
and
only
the
difficulty
of
the
thing
the
not
always
unjustifiable
fear
lest
the
wheat
should
be
pulled
up
with
the
tares
prevented
for
a
time
the
reformation
which
was
accomplished
in
the
church
and
through
her
separation
on
account
merely
of
abuses
in
ecclesiastical
life
when
the
doctrine
is
the
same
is
rejected
as
criminal
by
the
protestants
as
well
as
by
us
it
is
therefore
for
doctrine
sake
that
the
separation
occurred
and
the
general
discontent
of
the
people
the
weakening
of
ecclesiastical
authority
by
the
existence
of
abuses
only
facilitated
the
adoption
of
the
new
doctrines
but
now
on
one
side
some
of
these
defects
and
evils
in
the
life
of
the
church
have
disappeared
the
others
have
greatly
diminished
since
the
reforming
movement
and
on
the
other
side
the
principal
doctrines
for
which
they
separated
and
on
the
truth
of
which
and
their
necessity
for
salvation
the
right
and
duty
of
secession
was
based
are
given
up
by
protestant
science
deprived
of
their
scriptural
basis
by
exegesis
or
at
least
made
very
uncertain
by
the
opposition
of
the
most
eminent
protestant
divines
meanwhile
we
live
in
hopes
comforting
ourselves
with
the
conviction
that
history
or
that
process
of
development
in
europe
which
is
being
accomplished
before
our
eyes
as
well
in
society
and
politics
as
in
religion
is
the
powerful
ally
of
the
friends
of
ecclesiastical
union
and
we
hold
out
our
hands
to
christians
on
the
other
side
for
a
combined
war
of
resistance
against
the
destructive
movements
of
the
age
there
are
two
circumstances
which
make
us
fear
that
the
work
will
not
be
received
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
written
and
that
its
object
will
not
immediately
be
attained
the
first
of
these
is
the
extraordinary
effect
which
was
produced
by
the
declaration
which
the
author
made
on
the
occasion
of
the
late
assembly
of
the
catholic
associations
of
germany
at
munich
he
stated
simply
what
is
understood
by
every
catholic
out
of
italy
and
intelligible
to
every
reasonable
protestant
that
the
freedom
of
the
church
imperatively
requires
that
in
order
to
protect
the
pope
from
the
perils
which
menace
him
particularly
in
our
age
he
should
possess
a
sovereignty
not
merely
nominal
and
that
his
right
to
his
dominions
is
as
good
as
that
of
all
other
legitimate
sovereigns
in
point
of
fact
this
expression
of
opinion
which
occurs
even
in
the
garbled
reports
of
the
lectures
leaves
all
those
questions
on
which
it
is
possible
for
serious
and
dispassionate
men
to
be
divided
entirely
open
it
does
not
determine
whether
there
was
any
excuse
for
the
disaffection
of
the
papal
subjects
whether
the
security
afforded
by
a
more
extensive
dominion
is
greater
than
the
increased
difficulty
of
administration
under
the
conditions
inherited
from
the
french
occupation
whether
an
organised
system
of
tribute
or
domains
might
be
sufficient
in
conjunction
with
a
more
restricted
territory
whether
the
actual
loss
of
power
is
or
is
not
likely
to
improve
a
misfortune
for
religion
the
storm
of
applause
with
which
these
words
simply
expressing
that
in
which
all
agree
were
received
must
have
suggested
to
the
speaker
that
his
countrymen
in
general
are
unprepared
to
believe
that
one
who
has
no
other
aspiration
in
his
life
and
his
works
than
the
advancement
of
the
catholic
religion
can
speak
without
a
reverent
awe
of
the
temporal
government
or
can
witness
without
dismay
its
impending
fall
they
must
have
persuaded
themselves
that
not
only
the
details
but
the
substance
of
his
lectures
had
been
entirely
misreported
and
that
his
views
were
as
free
from
novelty
as
destitute
of
offence
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
such
persons
will
be
able
to
reconcile
themselves
to
the
fearless
and
straightforward
spirit
in
which
the
first
of
church
historians
discusses
the
history
of
his
own
age
another
consideration
almost
equally
significant
with
the
attitude
of
the
great
mass
of
catholics
is
the
silence
of
the
minority
who
agree
with
döllinger
those
earnest
catholics
who
in
their
italian
patriotism
insist
on
the
possibility
of
reconciling
the
liberty
of
the
holy
see
with
the
establishment
of
an
ideal
unity
passaglia
tosti
the
followers
of
gioberti
and
the
disciples
of
rosmini
have
not
hesitated
to
utter
openly
their
honest
but
most
inconceivable
persuasion
but
on
the
german
side
of
the
alps
where
no
political
agitation
affects
the
religious
judgment
or
drives
men
into
disputes
those
eminent
thinkers
who
agree
with
döllinger
are
withheld
by
various
considerations
from
publishing
their
views
sometimes
it
is
the
hopelessness
of
making
an
impression
sometimes
the
grave
inconvenience
of
withstanding
the
current
of
opinion
that
makes
them
keep
silence
and
their
silence
leaves
those
who
habitually
follow
them
not
only
without
means
of
expressing
their
views
but
often
without
decided
views
to
express
the
same
influences
which
deprive
döllinger
of
the
open
support
of
these
natural
allies
will
impede
the
success
of
his
work
until
events
have
outstripped
ideas
and
until
men
awake
to
the
discovery
that
what
they
refused
to
anticipate
or
to
prepare
for
is
already
accomplished
piety
sometimes
gives
birth
to
scruples
and
faith
to
superstition
when
they
are
not
directed
by
wisdom
and
knowledge
one
source
of
the
difficulty
of
which
we
are
speaking
is
as
much
a
defect
of
faith
as
a
defect
of
knowledge
just
as
it
is
difficult
for
some
catholics
to
believe
that
the
supreme
spiritual
authority
on
earth
could
ever
be
in
unworthy
hands
so
they
find
it
hard
to
reconcile
the
reverence
due
to
the
vicar
of
christ
and
the
promises
made
to
him
with
the
acknowledgment
of
intolerable
abuses
in
his
temporal
administration
it
is
a
comfort
to
make
the
best
of
the
case
to
draw
conclusions
from
the
exaggerations
the
inventions
and
the
malice
of
the
accusers
against
the
justice
of
the
accusation
and
in
favour
of
the
accused
it
is
a
temptation
to
our
weakness
and
to
our
consciences
to
defend
the
pope
as
we
would
defend
ourselves
with
the
same
care
and
zeal
with
the
same
uneasy
secret
consciousness
that
there
are
weak
points
in
the
case
which
can
best
be
concealed
by
diverting
attention
from
them
what
the
defence
gains
in
energy
it
loses
in
sincerity
the
cause
of
the
church
which
is
the
cause
of
truth
is
mixed
up
and
confused
with
human
elements
and
is
injured
by
a
degrading
alliance
in
this
way
even
piety
may
lead
to
immorality
and
devotion
to
the
pope
may
lead
away
from
god
the
position
of
perpetual
antagonism
to
a
spirit
which
we
abhor
the
knowledge
that
the
clamour
against
the
temporal
power
is
in
very
many
instances
inspired
by
hatred
of
the
spiritual
authority
the
indignation
at
the
impure
motives
mixed
up
with
the
movement
all
these
things
easily
blind
catholics
to
the
fact
that
our
attachment
to
the
pope
as
our
spiritual
head
our
notion
that
his
civil
sovereignty
is
a
safeguard
of
his
freedom
are
the
real
motives
of
our
disposition
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
accusations
made
against
his
government
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
imputations
which
take
the
form
of
insults
and
which
strike
at
the
church
through
the
state
are
well
founded
and
to
distinguish
the
design
and
the
occasion
from
the
facts
it
is
perhaps
more
than
we
can
expect
of
men
that
after
defending
the
pope
as
a
sovereign
because
he
is
a
pontiff
and
adopting
against
his
enemies
the
policy
of
unconditional
defence
they
will
consent
to
adopt
a
view
which
corroborates
to
a
great
extent
the
assertions
they
have
combated
and
implicitly
condemns
their
tactics
it
is
natural
to
oppose
one
extreme
by
another
and
those
who
avoid
both
easily
appear
to
be
capitulating
with
error
the
effects
of
this
spirit
of
opposition
are
not
confined
to
those
who
are
engaged
in
resisting
the
party
in
england
or
the
revolution
in
italy
the
fate
of
the
temporal
power
hangs
neither
on
the
italian
ministry
nor
on
english
influence
but
on
the
decision
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
and
the
loudest
maintainers
of
the
rights
of
the
holy
see
are
among
that
party
who
have
been
the
most
zealous
adversaries
of
the
imperial
system
the
french
catholics
behold
in
the
roman
policy
of
the
emperor
a
scheme
for
obtaining
over
the
church
a
power
of
which
they
would
be
the
first
victims
their
religious
freedom
is
in
jeopardy
while
he
has
the
fate
of
the
pope
in
his
hands
that
which
is
elsewhere
simply
a
manifestation
of
opinion
and
a
moral
influence
is
in
france
an
active
interference
and
a
political
power
they
alone
among
catholic
subjects
can
bring
a
pressure
to
bear
on
him
who
has
had
the
initiative
in
the
italian
movement
they
fear
by
silence
to
incur
a
responsibility
for
criminal
acts
for
them
it
is
a
season
for
action
and
the
time
has
not
yet
come
when
they
can
speak
with
judicial
impartiality
or
with
the
freedom
of
history
or
determine
how
far
in
the
pursuit
of
his
ambitious
ends
napoleon
iii
is
the
instrument
of
providence
or
how
far
without
any
merit
of
his
own
he
is
likely
to
fulfil
the
expectations
of
those
who
see
in
him
a
new
constantine
whilst
they
maintain
this
unequal
war
they
naturally
identify
the
rights
of
the
church
with
her
interests
and
the
wrongs
of
the
pope
are
before
their
eyes
so
as
to
eclipse
the
realities
of
the
roman
government
the
most
vehement
and
of
those
who
have
dwelt
exclusively
on
the
crimes
of
the
revolution
and
the
justice
of
the
papal
cause
the
bishop
of
orleans
for
instance
or
count
de
montalembert
might
without
inconsistency
and
doubtless
would
without
hesitation
subscribe
to
almost
every
word
in
döllinger
work
but
in
the
position
they
have
taken
they
would
probably
deem
such
adhesion
a
great
rhetorical
error
and
fatal
to
the
effect
of
their
own
writings
there
is
therefore
an
allowance
to
be
made
which
is
by
no
means
a
reproach
for
the
peculiar
situation
of
the
catholics
in
france
when
christine
of
sweden
was
observed
to
gaze
long
and
intently
at
the
statue
of
truth
in
rome
a
prelate
observed
that
this
admiration
for
truth
did
her
honour
as
it
was
seldom
shared
by
persons
in
her
station
that
said
the
queen
is
because
truths
are
not
all
made
of
marble
men
are
seldom
zealous
for
an
idea
in
which
they
do
not
perceive
some
reflection
of
themselves
in
which
they
have
not
embarked
some
portion
of
their
individuality
or
which
they
can
not
connect
with
some
subjective
purpose
of
their
own
it
is
often
more
easy
to
sympathise
with
a
person
in
whose
opposite
views
we
discern
a
weakness
corresponding
to
our
own
than
with
one
who
unsympathetically
avoids
to
colour
the
objectivity
of
truth
and
is
guided
in
his
judgment
by
facts
not
by
wishes
we
endeavoured
not
many
months
ago
to
show
how
remote
the
theology
of
catholic
germany
is
in
its
scientific
spirit
from
that
of
other
countries
and
how
far
asunder
are
science
and
policy
the
same
method
applied
to
the
events
of
our
own
day
must
be
yet
more
startling
and
for
a
time
we
can
scarcely
anticipate
that
the
author
of
this
work
will
escape
an
apparent
isolation
between
the
reserve
of
those
who
share
his
views
but
are
not
free
to
speak
and
the
foregone
conclusions
of
most
of
those
who
have
already
spoken
but
a
book
which
treats
of
contemporary
events
in
accordance
with
the
signs
of
the
time
not
with
the
aspirations
of
men
possesses
in
time
itself
an
invincible
auxiliary
when
the
lesson
which
this
great
writer
draws
from
the
example
of
the
mediæval
popes
has
borne
its
fruit
when
the
purpose
for
which
he
has
written
is
attained
and
the
freedom
of
the
holy
see
from
revolutionary
aggression
and
arbitrary
protection
is
recovered
by
the
heroic
determination
to
abandon
that
which
in
the
course
of
events
has
ceased
to
be
a
basis
of
independence
he
will
be
the
first
but
no
longer
the
only
proclaimer
of
new
ideas
and
he
will
not
have
written
in
vain
the
christian
religion
as
it
addresses
and
adapts
itself
to
all
mankind
bears
towards
the
varieties
of
national
character
a
relation
of
which
there
was
no
example
in
the
religions
of
antiquity
and
which
heresy
repudiates
and
inevitably
seeks
to
destroy
for
heresy
like
paganism
is
national
and
dependent
both
on
the
particular
disposition
of
the
people
and
on
the
government
of
the
state
it
is
identified
with
definite
local
conditions
and
moulded
by
national
and
political
peculiarities
catholicity
alone
is
universal
in
its
character
and
mission
and
independent
of
those
circumstances
by
which
states
are
established
and
nations
are
distinguished
from
each
other
even
rome
had
not
so
far
extended
her
limits
nor
so
thoroughly
subjugated
and
amalgamated
the
races
that
obeyed
her
as
to
secure
the
church
from
the
natural
reaction
of
national
spirit
against
a
religion
which
claimed
a
universality
beyond
even
that
of
the
imperial
power
the
first
and
most
terrible
assault
of
ethnicism
was
in
persia
where
christianity
appeared
as
a
roman
and
therefore
a
foreign
and
a
hostile
system
as
the
empire
gradually
declined
and
the
nationalities
no
longer
oppressed
beneath
a
vigorous
central
force
began
to
revive
the
heresies
by
a
natural
affinity
associated
themselves
with
them
the
donatist
schism
in
which
no
other
country
joined
was
an
attempt
of
the
african
people
to
establish
a
separate
national
church
later
on
the
egyptians
adopted
the
monophysite
heresy
as
the
national
faith
which
has
survived
to
this
day
in
the
coptic
church
in
armenia
similar
causes
produced
like
effects
in
the
twelfth
century
not
as
is
commonly
supposed
in
the
time
of
photius
and
cerularius
for
religious
communion
continued
to
subsist
between
the
latins
and
the
greeks
at
constantinople
till
about
the
time
of
innocent
but
after
the
crusades
had
embittered
the
antagonism
between
east
and
west
another
great
national
separation
occurred
in
the
eastern
empire
the
communion
with
rome
was
hateful
to
the
two
chief
authorities
the
patriarch
was
ambitious
to
extend
his
own
absolute
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
empire
the
emperor
wished
to
increase
that
power
as
the
instrument
of
his
own
out
of
this
threefold
combination
of
interests
sprang
the
byzantine
system
it
was
founded
on
the
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
civil
despotism
of
the
emperor
and
on
the
exclusive
pride
of
the
people
in
its
nationality
that
is
on
those
things
which
are
most
essentially
opposed
to
the
catholic
spirit
and
to
the
nature
of
a
universal
church
in
consequence
of
the
schism
the
sovereign
became
supreme
over
the
canons
of
the
church
and
the
laws
of
the
state
and
to
this
imperial
papacy
the
archbishop
of
thessalonica
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
justly
attributes
the
ruin
and
degradation
of
the
empire
like
the
eastern
schism
the
schism
of
the
west
in
the
fourteenth
century
arose
from
the
predominance
of
national
interests
in
the
church
it
proceeded
from
the
endeavour
to
convert
the
holy
see
into
a
possession
of
the
french
people
and
a
subject
of
the
french
crown
again
not
long
after
the
hussite
revolution
sprang
from
the
union
of
a
new
doctrine
with
the
old
antipathy
of
the
bohemians
for
the
germans
which
had
begun
in
times
when
the
boundaries
of
christianity
ran
between
the
two
nations
and
which
led
to
a
strictly
national
separation
which
has
not
yet
exhausted
its
political
effects
though
the
reformation
had
not
its
origin
in
national
feelings
yet
they
became
a
powerful
instrument
in
the
hands
of
luther
and
ultimately
prevailed
over
the
purely
theological
elements
of
the
movement
the
lutheran
system
was
looked
on
by
the
germans
with
patriotic
pride
as
the
native
fruit
and
especial
achievement
of
the
genius
of
their
country
and
it
was
adopted
out
of
germany
only
by
the
kindred
races
of
scandinavia
in
every
other
land
to
which
it
has
been
transplanted
by
the
migrations
of
this
century
lutheranism
appears
as
eradicated
from
its
congenial
soil
loses
gradually
its
distinctive
features
and
becomes
assimilated
to
the
more
consolatory
system
of
geneva
calvinism
exhibited
from
the
first
no
traces
of
the
influence
of
national
character
and
to
this
it
owes
its
greater
extension
whilst
in
the
third
form
of
protestantism
the
anglican
church
nationality
is
the
predominant
characteristic
in
whatever
country
and
in
whatever
form
protestantism
has
prevailed
it
has
always
carried
out
the
principle
of
separation
and
local
limitation
by
seeking
to
subject
itself
to
the
civil
power
and
to
confine
the
church
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
it
is
dependent
not
so
much
on
national
character
as
on
political
authority
and
has
grafted
itself
rather
on
the
state
than
on
the
people
but
the
institution
which
christ
founded
in
order
to
collect
all
nations
together
in
one
fold
under
one
shepherd
while
tolerating
and
respecting
the
natural
historical
distinctions
of
nations
and
of
states
endeavours
to
reconcile
antagonism
and
to
smooth
away
barriers
between
them
instead
of
estranging
them
by
artificial
differences
and
erecting
new
obstacles
to
their
harmony
the
church
can
neither
submit
as
a
whole
to
the
influence
of
a
particular
people
nor
impose
on
one
the
features
or
the
habits
of
another
for
she
is
exalted
in
her
catholicity
above
the
differences
of
race
and
above
the
claims
of
political
power
at
once
the
most
firm
and
the
most
flexible
institution
in
the
world
she
is
all
things
to
all
nations
educating
each
in
her
own
spirit
without
violence
to
its
nature
and
assimilating
it
to
herself
without
prejudice
to
the
originality
of
its
native
character
whilst
she
thus
transforms
them
not
by
reducing
them
to
a
uniform
type
but
by
raising
them
towards
a
common
elevation
she
receives
from
them
services
in
return
each
healthy
and
vigorous
nation
that
is
converted
is
a
dynamic
as
well
as
a
numerical
increase
in
the
resources
of
the
church
by
bringing
an
accession
of
new
and
peculiar
qualities
as
well
as
of
quantity
and
numbers
so
far
from
seeking
sameness
or
flourishing
only
in
one
atmosphere
she
is
enriched
and
strengthened
by
all
the
varieties
of
national
character
and
intellect
in
the
mission
of
the
catholic
church
each
nation
has
its
function
which
its
own
position
and
nature
indicate
and
enable
it
to
fulfil
thus
the
extinct
nations
of
antiquity
survive
in
the
beneficial
action
they
continue
to
exert
within
her
and
she
still
feels
and
acknowledges
the
influence
of
the
african
or
of
the
cappadocian
mind
the
condition
of
this
immunity
from
the
predominant
influence
of
national
and
political
divisions
and
of
this
indifference
to
the
attachment
of
particular
states
and
races
the
security
of
unity
and
universality
consists
in
the
existence
of
a
single
supreme
independent
head
the
primacy
is
the
bulwark
or
rather
the
of
catholicism
without
it
there
would
be
as
many
churches
as
there
are
nations
or
states
not
one
of
those
who
have
denounced
the
papacy
as
a
usurpation
has
ever
attempted
to
show
that
the
condition
which
its
absence
necessarily
involves
is
theologically
desirable
or
that
it
is
the
will
of
god
it
remains
the
most
radical
and
conspicuous
distinction
between
the
catholic
church
and
the
sects
those
who
attempt
to
do
without
it
are
compelled
to
argue
that
there
is
no
earthly
office
divinely
appointed
for
the
government
of
the
church
and
that
nobody
has
received
the
mission
to
conduct
ecclesiastical
affairs
and
to
preserve
the
divine
order
in
religion
the
several
local
churches
may
have
an
earthly
ruler
but
for
the
whole
church
of
christ
there
is
no
such
protection
christ
therefore
is
the
only
head
they
acknowledge
and
they
must
necessarily
declare
separation
isolation
and
discord
to
be
a
principle
and
the
normal
condition
of
his
church
the
rejection
of
the
primacy
of
peter
has
driven
men
on
to
a
slippery
course
where
all
the
steps
are
downwards
the
greeks
first
proclaimed
that
they
recognised
no
pope
that
each
patriarch
ruled
over
a
portion
of
the
church
the
anglicans
rejected
both
pope
and
patriarch
and
admitted
no
ecclesiastical
order
higher
than
the
episcopate
foreign
protestanism
refused
to
tolerate
even
bishops
or
any
authority
but
the
parish
clergy
under
the
supremacy
of
the
ruler
of
the
land
then
the
sects
abolished
the
local
jurisdiction
of
the
parish
clergy
and
retained
only
preachers
at
length
the
ministry
was
rejected
as
an
office
altogether
and
the
quakers
made
each
individual
his
own
prophet
priest
and
doctor
the
papacy
that
unique
institution
the
crown
of
the
catholic
system
exhibits
in
its
history
the
constant
working
of
that
law
which
is
at
the
foundation
of
the
life
of
the
church
the
law
of
continuous
organic
development
it
shared
the
vicissitudes
of
the
church
and
had
its
part
in
everything
which
influences
the
course
and
mode
of
her
existence
in
early
times
it
grew
in
silence
and
obscurity
its
features
were
rarely
and
imperfectly
distinguishable
but
even
then
the
popes
exerted
their
authority
in
all
directions
and
while
the
wisdom
with
which
it
was
exercised
was
often
questioned
the
right
itself
was
undisputed
so
long
as
the
roman
empire
upheld
in
its
strong
framework
and
kept
together
the
church
which
was
confined
mostly
within
its
bounds
and
checked
with
the
stern
discipline
of
a
uniform
law
the
manifestations
of
national
and
local
divergence
the
interference
of
the
holy
see
was
less
frequently
required
and
the
reins
of
church
government
did
not
need
to
be
tightly
drawn
when
a
new
order
of
states
emerged
from
the
chaos
of
the
great
migration
the
papacy
which
alone
stood
erect
amid
the
ruins
of
the
empire
became
the
centre
of
a
new
system
and
the
moderator
of
a
new
code
the
long
contest
with
the
germanic
empire
exhausted
the
political
power
both
of
the
empire
and
of
the
papacy
and
the
position
of
the
holy
see
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
equal
states
became
more
difficult
and
more
unfavourable
the
popes
were
forced
to
rely
on
the
protection
of
france
their
supremacy
over
the
states
was
at
an
end
and
the
resistance
of
the
nations
commenced
the
schism
the
opposition
of
the
general
councils
the
circumstances
which
plunged
the
holy
see
into
the
intrigues
of
italian
politics
and
at
last
the
reformation
hastened
the
decline
of
that
extensive
social
and
political
power
the
echoes
and
reminiscences
of
which
occasioned
disaster
and
repulse
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
to
exercise
it
ever
since
the
tridentine
age
the
popes
have
confined
themselves
more
and
more
exclusively
to
the
religious
domain
and
here
the
holy
see
is
as
powerful
and
as
free
at
the
present
day
as
at
any
previous
period
of
its
history
the
perils
and
the
difficulties
which
surround
it
arise
from
temporal
concerns
from
the
state
of
italy
and
from
the
possessions
of
the
pontifical
dominions
as
the
church
advances
towards
fulness
and
maturity
in
her
forms
bringing
forward
her
exhaustless
resources
and
calling
into
existence
a
wealth
of
new
elements
societies
corporations
and
institutions
so
is
the
need
more
deeply
felt
for
a
powerful
supreme
guide
to
keep
them
all
in
health
and
harmony
to
direct
them
in
their
various
spheres
and
in
their
several
ways
towards
the
common
ends
and
purposes
of
all
and
thus
to
provide
against
decay
variance
and
confusion
such
an
office
the
primacy
alone
can
discharge
and
the
importance
of
the
papacy
increases
as
the
organisation
of
the
church
is
more
complete
one
of
its
most
important
but
most
delicate
duties
is
to
act
as
an
independent
impartial
and
dispassionate
mediator
between
the
churches
and
the
governments
of
the
different
states
and
between
the
conflicting
claims
and
contradictory
idiosyncrasies
of
the
various
nations
yet
though
the
papacy
is
so
obviously
an
essential
part
of
a
church
whose
mission
is
to
all
mankind
it
is
the
chosen
object
of
attack
both
to
enemies
of
catholicism
and
to
discontented
catholics
serious
and
learned
men
complain
of
its
tyranny
and
say
that
it
claims
universal
dominion
and
watches
for
an
opportunity
of
obtaining
it
and
yet
in
reality
there
is
no
power
on
earth
whose
action
is
restricted
by
more
sacred
and
irresistible
bonds
than
that
of
the
holy
see
it
is
only
by
the
closest
fidelity
to
the
laws
and
tradition
of
the
church
that
the
popes
are
able
to
secure
the
obedience
and
the
confidence
of
catholics
pius
who
by
sweeping
away
the
ancient
church
of
france
and
depriving
protesting
bishops
of
their
sees
committed
the
most
arbitrary
act
ever
done
by
a
pope
has
himself
described
the
rules
which
guided
the
exercise
of
his
authority
the
nature
and
constitution
of
the
catholic
church
impose
on
the
pope
who
is
the
head
of
the
church
certain
limits
which
he
can
not
transgress
the
bishops
of
rome
have
never
believed
that
they
could
tolerate
any
alteration
in
those
portions
of
the
discipline
which
are
directly
ordained
by
jesus
christ
or
in
those
which
by
their
nature
are
connected
with
dogma
or
in
those
which
heretics
assail
in
support
of
their
innovations
the
chief
points
urged
against
the
ambition
of
rome
are
the
claim
of
the
deposing
power
according
to
the
theory
that
all
kinds
of
power
are
united
in
the
church
and
the
protest
against
the
peace
of
westphalia
the
basis
of
the
public
law
and
political
order
of
modern
europe
it
is
enough
to
cite
one
of
the
many
authorities
which
may
be
cited
in
refutation
of
the
first
objection
cardinal
antonelli
prefect
of
propaganda
states
in
his
letter
to
the
irish
bishops
that
the
see
of
rome
has
never
taught
that
faith
is
not
to
be
kept
with
those
of
another
religion
or
that
an
oath
sworn
to
kings
who
are
separated
from
the
catholic
communion
may
be
broken
or
that
the
pope
is
permitted
to
touch
their
temporal
rights
and
possessions
the
bull
in
which
boniface
viii
set
up
the
theory
of
the
supremacy
of
the
spiritual
over
the
secular
power
was
retracted
soon
after
his
death
the
protest
of
innocent
against
the
peace
of
westphalia
is
one
of
the
glories
of
the
papacy
that
peace
was
concluded
on
an
unchristian
and
tyrannical
principle
introduced
by
the
reformation
that
the
subjects
may
be
compelled
to
follow
the
religion
of
the
ruler
this
was
very
different
in
principle
and
in
effect
from
the
intolerance
of
the
ages
of
faith
when
prince
and
people
were
members
of
one
religion
and
all
were
agreed
that
no
other
could
be
permitted
in
the
state
every
heresy
that
arose
in
the
middle
ages
involved
revolutionary
consequences
and
would
inevitably
have
overthrown
state
and
society
as
well
as
church
wherever
it
prevailed
the
albigenses
who
provoked
the
cruel
legislation
against
heretics
and
who
were
exterminated
by
fire
and
sword
were
the
socialists
of
those
days
they
assailed
the
fundamental
institutions
of
society
marriage
family
and
property
and
their
triumph
would
have
plunged
europe
into
the
barbarism
and
licence
of
pagan
times
the
principles
of
the
waldenses
and
the
lollards
were
likewise
incompatible
with
european
civilisation
in
those
days
the
law
relating
to
religion
was
the
same
for
all
the
pope
as
well
as
the
king
would
have
lost
his
crown
if
he
had
fallen
into
heresy
during
a
thousand
years
from
the
fall
of
rome
to
the
appearance
of
luther
no
catholic
prince
ever
made
an
attempt
to
introduce
a
new
religion
into
his
dominions
or
to
abandon
the
old
but
the
reformation
taught
that
this
was
the
supreme
duty
of
princes
whilst
luther
declared
that
in
matters
of
faith
the
individual
is
above
every
authority
and
that
a
child
could
understand
the
scriptures
better
than
popes
or
councils
he
taught
at
the
same
time
with
an
inconsistency
which
he
never
attempted
to
remove
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
civil
power
to
exterminate
popery
to
set
up
the
gospel
and
to
suppress
every
other
religion
the
result
was
a
despotism
such
as
the
world
had
never
seen
it
was
worse
than
the
byzantine
system
for
there
no
attempt
was
made
to
change
the
faith
of
the
people
the
protestant
princes
exercised
an
ecclesiastical
authority
more
arbitrary
than
the
pope
had
ever
possessed
for
the
papal
authority
can
only
be
used
to
maintain
an
existing
doctrine
whilst
theirs
was
aggressive
and
wholly
unlimited
possessing
the
power
to
command
and
to
alter
in
religion
they
naturally
acquired
by
degrees
a
corresponding
absolutism
in
the
civil
order
the
consistories
the
office
by
which
the
sovereign
ruled
the
church
were
the
commencement
of
bureaucratic
centralisation
a
great
lawyer
of
those
days
says
that
after
the
treaties
of
westphalia
had
recognised
the
territorial
supremacy
over
religion
the
business
of
administration
in
the
german
states
increased
tenfold
whilst
that
system
remained
in
its
integrity
there
could
be
no
peaceful
neighbourhood
between
catholics
and
protestants
from
this
point
of
view
the
protest
of
the
pope
was
entirely
justified
so
far
from
having
been
made
in
the
spirit
of
the
mediæval
authority
which
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
work
of
the
congress
it
was
never
used
by
any
catholic
prince
to
invalidate
the
treaties
they
took
advantage
of
the
law
in
their
own
territories
to
exercise
the
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
tolerate
a
body
which
still
refused
to
tolerate
the
catholic
religion
by
the
side
of
its
own
which
accordingly
eradicated
it
wherever
it
had
the
means
and
whose
theory
made
the
existence
of
every
religion
depend
on
the
power
and
the
will
of
the
sovereign
a
system
which
so
resolutely
denied
that
two
religions
could
coexist
in
the
same
state
put
every
attempt
at
mutual
toleration
out
of
the
question
the
reformation
was
a
great
movement
against
the
freedom
of
conscience
an
effort
to
subject
it
to
a
new
authority
the
arbitrary
initiative
of
a
prince
who
might
differ
in
religion
from
all
his
subjects
the
extermination
of
obstinate
catholics
was
a
matter
of
course
melanchthon
insisted
that
the
anabaptists
should
be
put
to
death
and
beza
was
of
opinion
that
ought
to
be
executed
even
after
recantation
but
no
lutheran
could
complain
when
the
secular
arm
converted
him
into
a
calvinist
your
conscience
is
in
error
he
would
say
but
under
the
circumstances
you
are
not
only
justified
but
compelled
on
my
own
principles
to
act
as
you
do
the
resistance
of
the
catholic
governments
to
the
progress
of
a
religion
which
announced
that
it
would
destroy
them
as
soon
as
it
had
the
power
was
an
instinct
of
no
protestant
divine
denied
or
disguised
the
truth
that
his
party
sought
the
destruction
of
catholicism
and
would
accomplish
it
whenever
they
could
the
calvinists
with
their
usual
fearless
consistency
held
that
as
civil
and
ecclesiastical
power
must
be
in
the
same
hands
no
prince
had
any
right
to
govern
who
did
not
belong
to
them
even
in
the
low
countries
where
other
sects
were
free
and
the
notion
of
unity
abandoned
the
catholics
were
oppressed
this
new
and
aggressive
intolerance
infected
even
catholic
countries
where
there
was
neither
as
in
spain
religious
unity
to
be
preserved
nor
as
in
austria
a
menacing
danger
to
be
resisted
for
in
spain
the
persecution
of
the
protestants
might
be
defended
on
the
mediæval
principle
of
unity
whilst
under
ferdinand
ii
it
was
provoked
in
the
hereditary
dominions
by
the
imminent
peril
which
threatened
to
dethrone
the
monarch
and
to
ruin
every
faithful
catholic
but
in
france
the
protestant
doctrine
that
every
good
subject
must
follow
the
religion
of
his
king
grew
out
of
the
intensity
of
personal
absolutism
at
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
official
argument
was
the
will
of
the
sovereign
an
argument
which
in
germany
had
reigned
so
triumphantly
that
a
single
town
which
had
ten
times
changed
masters
changed
its
religion
ten
times
in
a
century
bayle
justly
reproaches
the
catholic
clergy
of
france
with
having
permitted
and
even
approved
a
proceeding
so
directly
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
their
religion
and
to
the
wishes
of
the
pope
a
convert
who
wrote
a
book
to
prove
that
huguenots
were
in
conscience
bound
to
obey
the
royal
edict
which
proscribed
their
worship
met
with
applause
a
hundred
years
later
this
fault
of
the
french
clergy
was
expiated
in
the
blood
of
their
successors
the
excess
of
evil
led
to
its
gradual
cure
in
england
protestantism
lost
its
vigour
after
the
victory
over
the
catholic
dynasty
religion
faded
away
and
with
it
that
religious
zeal
which
leads
to
persecution
when
the
religious
antagonism
was
no
longer
kept
alive
by
a
political
controversy
the
sense
of
right
and
the
spirit
of
freedom
which
belongs
to
the
race
accomplished
the
work
which
indifference
had
begun
in
germany
the
vitality
of
the
lutheran
theology
expired
after
it
had
lasted
for
about
two
hundred
years
the
intellectual
contradictions
and
the
social
consequences
of
the
system
had
become
intolerable
to
the
german
mind
rationalism
had
begun
to
prevail
when
frederick
ii
declared
that
his
subjects
should
work
out
their
salvation
in
their
own
way
that
generation
of
men
who
looked
with
contempt
on
religious
zeal
looked
with
horror
on
religious
persecution
the
catholic
church
which
had
never
taught
that
princes
are
supreme
over
the
religion
of
their
subjects
could
have
no
difficulty
in
going
along
with
public
opinion
when
it
disapproved
of
compulsion
in
matters
of
conscience
it
was
natural
that
in
the
new
order
of
things
when
christendom
had
lost
its
unity
and
protestantism
its
violence
she
should
revert
to
the
position
she
occupied
of
old
when
she
admitted
other
religions
to
equal
rights
with
herself
and
when
men
like
ambrose
martin
and
leo
deprecated
the
use
of
violence
against
heretics
nevertheless
as
the
preservation
of
morality
depends
on
the
preservation
of
faith
both
alike
are
in
the
interest
and
within
the
competence
of
the
state
the
church
of
her
own
strength
is
not
strong
enough
to
resist
the
advance
of
heresy
and
unbelief
those
enemies
find
an
auxiliary
in
the
breast
of
every
man
whose
weakness
and
whose
passions
repel
him
from
a
church
which
imposes
such
onerous
duties
on
her
members
but
it
is
neither
possible
to
define
the
conditions
without
which
liberty
must
be
fatal
to
the
state
nor
the
limits
beyond
which
protection
and
repression
become
tyrannical
and
provoke
a
reaction
more
terrible
than
the
indifference
of
the
civil
power
the
events
of
the
last
hundred
years
have
tended
in
most
places
to
mingle
protestants
and
catholics
together
and
to
break
down
the
social
and
political
lines
of
demarcation
between
them
and
time
will
show
the
providential
design
which
has
brought
about
this
great
change
these
are
the
subjects
treated
in
the
first
two
chapters
on
the
church
and
the
nations
and
on
the
papacy
in
connection
with
the
universality
of
catholicism
as
contrasted
with
the
national
and
political
dependence
of
heresy
the
two
following
chapters
pursue
the
topic
farther
in
a
general
historical
retrospect
which
increases
in
interest
and
importance
as
it
proceeds
from
the
social
to
the
religious
purpose
and
influence
of
the
papacy
and
from
the
past
to
the
present
time
the
third
chapter
the
churches
and
civil
liberty
examines
the
effects
of
protestantism
on
civil
society
the
fourth
entitled
the
churches
without
a
pope
considers
the
actual
theological
and
religious
fruits
of
separation
from
the
visible
head
of
the
church
the
independence
of
the
church
through
that
of
her
supreme
pontiff
is
as
nearly
connected
with
political
as
with
religious
liberty
since
the
ecclesiastical
system
which
rejects
the
pope
logically
leads
to
arbitrary
power
throughout
the
north
of
europe
in
sweden
and
denmark
in
mecklenburg
and
pomerania
in
prussia
saxony
and
brunswick
the
power
which
the
reformation
gave
to
the
state
introduced
an
unmitigated
despotism
every
security
was
removed
which
protected
the
people
against
the
abuse
of
the
sovereign
power
and
the
lower
against
the
oppression
of
the
upper
class
the
crown
became
sooner
or
later
despotic
the
peasantry
by
a
long
series
of
enactments
extending
to
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
reduced
to
servitude
the
population
grew
scanty
and
much
of
the
land
went
out
of
cultivation
all
this
is
related
by
the
protestant
historians
and
divines
not
in
the
tone
of
reluctant
admission
but
with
patriotic
indignation
commensurate
with
the
horrors
of
the
truth
in
all
these
countries
lutheran
unity
subsisted
if
calvinism
had
ever
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
equal
predominance
in
the
netherlands
the
power
of
the
house
of
orange
would
have
become
as
despotic
as
that
of
the
danish
or
the
prussian
sovereigns
but
its
triumph
was
impeded
by
sects
and
by
the
presence
of
a
large
catholic
minority
destitute
indeed
of
political
rights
or
religious
freedom
but
for
that
very
reason
removed
from
the
conflicts
of
parties
and
therefore
an
element
of
conservatism
and
a
natural
ally
of
those
who
resisted
the
ambition
of
the
stadtholders
the
absence
of
religious
unity
baffled
their
attempts
to
establish
arbitrary
power
on
the
victory
of
calvinism
and
upheld
in
conjunction
with
the
brilliant
policy
abroad
a
portion
of
the
ancient
freedom
in
scotland
the
other
home
of
pure
calvinism
where
intolerance
and
religious
tyranny
reached
a
pitch
equalled
only
among
the
puritans
in
america
the
perpetual
troubles
hindered
the
settlement
of
a
fixed
political
system
and
the
restoration
of
order
after
the
union
with
england
stripped
the
presbyterian
system
of
its
exclusive
supremacy
and
opened
the
way
for
tolerance
and
freedom
although
the
political
spirit
of
anglicanism
was
as
despotic
as
that
of
every
other
protestant
system
circumstances
prevented
its
full
development
the
catholic
church
had
bestowed
on
the
english
the
great
elements
of
their
political
prosperity
the
charter
of
their
liberties
the
fusion
of
the
races
and
the
abolition
of
villeinage
that
is
personal
and
general
freedom
and
national
unity
hence
the
people
were
so
thoroughly
impregnated
with
catholicism
that
the
reformation
was
imposed
on
them
by
foreign
troops
in
spite
of
an
armed
resistance
and
the
imported
manufacture
of
geneva
remained
so
strange
and
foreign
to
them
that
no
english
divine
of
the
sixteenth
century
enriched
it
with
a
single
original
idea
the
new
church
unlike
those
of
the
continent
was
the
result
of
an
endeavour
to
conciliate
the
catholic
disposition
of
the
people
by
preserving
as
far
as
possible
the
externals
to
which
they
were
attached
whilst
the
queen
who
was
a
protestant
rather
by
policy
than
by
conviction
desired
no
greater
change
than
was
necessary
for
her
purpose
but
the
divines
whom
she
placed
at
the
head
of
the
new
church
were
strict
calvinists
and
differed
from
the
puritans
only
in
their
submission
to
the
court
the
rapidly
declining
catholic
party
accepted
anglicanism
as
the
lesser
evil
while
zealous
protestants
deemed
that
the
outward
forms
ought
to
correspond
to
the
inward
substance
and
that
calvinistic
doctrines
required
a
calvinistic
constitution
until
the
end
of
the
century
there
was
no
anglican
theology
and
the
attempt
to
devise
a
system
in
harmony
with
the
peculiar
scheme
and
design
of
the
institution
began
with
hooker
the
monarch
was
absolute
master
in
the
church
which
had
been
established
as
an
instrument
of
royal
influence
and
the
divines
acknowledged
his
right
by
the
theory
of
passive
obedience
the
consistent
section
of
the
calvinists
was
won
over
for
a
time
by
the
share
which
the
gentry
obtained
in
the
spoils
of
the
church
and
by
the
welcome
concession
of
the
penal
laws
against
her
until
at
last
they
found
that
they
had
in
their
intolerance
been
forging
chains
for
themselves
one
thing
alone
which
our
national
jurists
had
recognised
in
the
fifteenth
century
as
the
cause
and
the
sign
of
our
superiority
over
foreign
states
the
exclusion
of
the
roman
code
and
the
unbroken
preservation
of
the
common
law
kept
england
from
sinking
beneath
a
despotism
as
oppressive
as
that
of
france
or
sweden
as
the
anglican
church
under
james
and
charles
was
the
bulwark
of
arbitrary
power
the
popular
resistance
took
the
form
of
ecclesiastical
opposition
the
church
continued
to
be
so
thoroughly
committed
to
the
principle
of
unconditional
submission
to
the
power
from
which
it
derived
its
existence
that
james
ii
could
reckon
on
this
servile
spirit
as
a
means
of
effecting
the
subversion
of
the
establishment
and
defoe
reproached
the
bishops
with
having
by
their
flattery
led
on
the
king
whom
they
abandoned
in
the
moment
of
his
need
the
revolution
which
reduced
the
royal
prerogative
removed
the
oppressiveness
of
the
royal
supremacy
the
established
church
was
not
emancipated
from
the
crown
but
the
nonconformists
were
emancipated
from
the
tyranny
of
the
established
church
protestantism
which
in
the
period
of
its
power
dragged
down
by
its
servility
the
liberties
of
the
nation
did
afterwards
in
its
decay
and
disorganisation
by
the
surrender
of
its
dogmatic
as
well
as
of
its
political
principle
promote
their
recovery
and
development
it
lost
its
oppressiveness
in
proportion
as
it
lost
its
strength
and
it
ceased
to
be
tyrannical
when
divines
had
been
forced
to
give
up
its
fundamental
doctrine
and
when
its
unity
had
been
dissolved
by
the
sects
the
revival
of
those
liberties
which
in
the
middle
ages
had
taken
root
under
the
influence
of
the
church
coincided
with
the
progress
of
the
protestant
sects
and
with
the
decay
of
the
penal
laws
the
contrast
between
the
political
character
of
those
countries
in
which
protestantism
integrally
prevailed
and
that
of
those
in
which
it
was
divided
against
itself
and
could
neither
establish
its
system
nor
work
out
its
consequences
is
as
strongly
marked
as
the
contrast
between
the
politics
of
catholic
times
and
those
which
were
introduced
by
the
reformation
the
evil
which
it
wrought
in
its
strength
was
turned
to
good
by
its
decline
such
is
the
sketch
of
the
effects
of
the
protestant
apostasy
in
the
political
order
considered
chiefly
in
relation
to
the
absence
of
a
supreme
ecclesiastical
authority
independent
of
political
control
it
would
require
far
more
space
to
exhibit
the
positive
influence
of
heretical
principles
on
the
social
foundations
of
political
life
and
the
picture
would
not
be
complete
without
showing
the
contrast
exhibited
by
catholic
states
and
tracing
their
passage
from
the
mediæval
system
under
the
influence
of
the
reaction
against
the
reformation
the
third
chapter
covers
only
a
portion
of
this
extensive
subject
but
it
shows
the
action
of
the
new
mode
of
ecclesiastical
government
upon
the
civil
order
and
proves
that
the
importance
of
the
papacy
is
not
confined
to
its
religious
sphere
it
thus
prepares
the
way
for
the
subject
discussed
in
the
fourth
chapter
the
most
comprehensive
and
elaborate
in
the
book
döllinger
begins
his
survey
of
the
churches
that
have
renounced
the
pope
with
those
of
the
eastern
schism
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
whose
ecclesiastical
authority
is
enormous
and
whose
opportunities
of
extorting
money
are
so
great
that
he
is
generally
deposed
at
the
end
of
two
or
three
years
in
order
that
many
may
succeed
each
other
in
the
enjoyment
of
such
advantages
serves
not
as
a
protection
but
as
an
instrument
for
the
oppression
of
the
christians
the
greek
clergy
have
been
the
chief
means
by
which
the
turks
have
kept
down
both
the
greek
and
the
slavonic
population
and
the
slavs
are
by
degrees
throwing
off
their
influence
submission
to
the
civil
power
is
so
natural
in
communities
separated
from
the
universal
church
that
the
greeks
look
up
to
the
turkish
authorities
as
arbiters
in
ecclesiastical
matters
when
there
was
a
dispute
between
greeks
and
armenians
respecting
the
mixture
of
water
with
the
wine
in
the
chalice
the
question
was
referred
for
decision
to
the
proper
quarter
and
the
reis
effendi
decided
that
wine
being
condemned
by
the
koran
water
alone
might
be
used
yet
to
this
pusillanimous
and
degenerate
church
belong
the
future
of
european
turkey
and
the
inheritance
of
the
sinking
power
of
the
turks
the
vitality
of
the
dominant
race
is
nearly
exhausted
and
the
christians
on
whose
pillage
they
live
exceed
them
in
increasing
proportions
in
numbers
prosperity
intelligence
and
enterprise
the
hellenic
church
obeying
the
general
law
of
schismatical
communities
has
exchanged
the
authority
of
the
patriarch
for
that
of
the
crown
exercised
through
a
synod
which
is
appointed
on
the
russian
model
by
the
government
the
clergy
disabled
for
religious
purposes
by
the
necessity
of
providing
for
their
families
have
little
education
and
little
influence
and
have
no
part
in
the
revival
of
the
grecian
intellect
but
the
people
are
attached
to
their
ecclesiastical
system
not
for
religion
sake
for
infidelity
generally
accompanies
education
but
as
the
defence
of
their
nationality
in
russia
the
catholic
church
is
considered
heretical
because
of
her
teaching
on
the
procession
of
the
holy
ghost
and
schismatical
in
consequence
of
the
claims
of
the
pope
in
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
there
is
no
essential
difference
and
on
this
point
an
understanding
could
easily
be
arrived
at
if
none
had
an
interest
in
widening
the
breach
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
russian
church
retained
so
much
independence
that
the
metropolitan
of
kiev
could
hold
in
check
the
power
of
the
czar
and
the
clergy
were
the
mediators
between
the
people
and
the
nobles
or
the
crown
this
influence
was
swept
away
by
the
despotism
of
peter
the
great
and
under
catherine
ii
the
property
of
the
church
was
annexed
to
the
crown
lands
in
order
it
was
said
to
relieve
the
clergy
of
the
burden
of
administration
yet
even
now
the
protestant
doctrine
that
the
sovereign
is
supreme
in
all
matters
of
religion
has
not
penetrated
among
the
russians
but
though
the
czar
does
not
possess
this
authority
over
the
national
church
of
which
he
is
a
member
the
protestant
system
has
conceded
it
to
him
in
the
baltic
provinces
not
only
are
all
children
of
mixed
marriages
between
protestants
and
schismatics
brought
up
in
the
religion
of
the
latter
by
which
the
gradual
decline
of
protestanism
is
provided
for
but
conversions
to
protestanism
even
of
jews
mohammedans
and
heathens
are
forbidden
and
in
all
questions
of
doctrine
or
of
liturgy
the
last
appeal
is
to
the
emperor
the
religious
despotism
usually
associated
with
the
russian
monarchy
subsists
only
for
the
protestants
the
russian
church
is
dumb
the
congregation
does
not
sing
the
priest
does
not
preach
the
people
have
no
and
are
therefore
confined
to
the
narrow
circle
of
their
own
religious
ideas
against
the
cloud
of
superstition
which
naturally
gathers
in
a
religion
of
ceremonies
destitute
of
the
means
of
keeping
alive
or
cultivating
the
religious
sentiments
of
the
people
there
is
no
resource
in
spite
of
the
degeneracy
of
their
clergy
which
they
are
unable
to
feel
the
russians
cling
with
patriotic
affection
to
their
church
and
identify
its
progress
and
prosperity
with
the
increase
of
their
empire
as
it
is
an
exclusively
national
institution
every
war
may
become
a
war
of
religion
and
it
is
the
attachment
to
the
church
which
creates
the
longing
and
the
claim
to
possess
the
city
from
which
it
came
from
the
church
the
empire
derives
its
tendency
to
expand
and
the
czar
the
hopes
of
that
universal
dominion
which
was
promised
to
him
by
the
synod
of
moscow
in
and
for
which
a
prayer
was
then
appointed
the
schismatical
clergy
of
eastern
europe
are
the
channel
of
russian
influence
the
pioneers
of
russian
aggression
the
political
dependence
of
the
church
corresponds
to
its
political
influence
subserviency
is
the
condition
of
the
power
it
possesses
the
certificate
of
easter
confession
and
communion
is
required
for
every
civil
act
and
is
consequently
an
object
of
traffic
in
like
manner
the
confessor
is
bound
to
betray
to
the
police
all
the
secrets
of
confession
which
affect
the
interest
of
the
government
in
this
deplorable
state
of
corruption
servitude
and
decay
within
and
of
threatening
hostility
to
christian
civilisation
abroad
the
russian
church
pays
the
penalty
of
its
byzantine
descent
the
established
church
and
the
sects
in
england
furnish
few
opportunities
of
treating
points
which
would
be
new
to
our
readers
perhaps
the
most
suggestive
portion
is
the
description
of
the
effects
of
protestantism
on
the
character
and
condition
of
the
people
the
plunder
and
oppression
of
the
poor
has
everywhere
followed
the
plunder
of
the
church
which
was
the
guardian
and
refuge
of
the
poor
the
charity
of
the
catholic
clergy
aimed
not
merely
at
relieving
but
at
preventing
poverty
it
was
their
object
not
only
to
give
alms
but
to
give
to
the
lower
orders
the
means
of
obtaining
a

the
reformation
at
once
checked
so
that
selden
says
in
places
where
twenty
pounds
a
year
had
been
distributed
formerly
not
a
handful
of
meal
was
given
away
in
his
time
for
the

clergy
could
not
afford
it
the
confiscation
of
the
lands
where
thousands
had
tilled
the
soil
under
the
shadow
of
the
monastery
or
the
church
was
followed
by
a
new
system
of
cultivation
which
deprived
the
peasants
of
their
homes
the
sheep
men
said
were
the
cause
of
all
the
woe
and
whole
towns
were
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
them
the
prelates
of
the
sixteenth
century
lament
the
decline
of
charity
since
the
catholic
times
and
a
divine
attributed
the
growing
selfishness
and
harshness
to
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
the
alteration
in
the
condition
of
the
poor
was
followed
by
severe
enactments
against
vagrancy
and
the
protestant
legislature
after
creating
a
proletariate
treated
it
as
a
crime
the
conversion
of
sunday
into
a
jewish
sabbath
cut
off
the
holiday
amusements
and
soured
the
cheerfulness
of
the
population
music
singing
and
dancing
the
favourite
relaxation
of
a
contented
people
disappeared
and
especially
after
the
war
in
the
low
countries
drunkenness
began
to
prevail
among
a
nation
which
in
earlier
times
had
been
reckoned
the
most
sober
of
northern
europe
the
institution
which
introduced
these
changes
has
become
a
state
not
a
national
church
whose
services
are
more
attended
by
the
rich
than
by
the
poor
after
describing
the
various
parties
in
the
anglican
system
the
decay
of
its
divinity
and
the
general
aversion
to
theological
research
döllinger
concludes
that
its
dissolution
is
a
question
of
time
no
state
church
can
long
subsist
in
modern
society
which
professes
the
religion
of
the
minority
whilst
the
want
of
a
definite
system
of
doctrine
allowing
every
clergyman
to
be
the
mouthpiece
not
of
a
church
but
of
a
party
drives
an
increasing
portion
of
the
people
to
join
the
sects
which
have
a
fixed
doctrine
and
allow
less
independence
to
their
preachers
the
great
danger
which
menaces
the
church
comes
from
the
state
itself
the
progress
of
dissent
and
of
democracy
in
the
legislature
will
make
the
church
more
and
more
entirely
dependent
on
the
will
of
the
majority
and
will
drive
the
best
men
from
the
communion
of
a
servile
establishment
the
rise
and
fortunes
of
methodism
are
related
with
peculiar
predilection
by
the
author
who
speaks
of
john
wesley
as
the
greatest
intellect
english
protestantism
has
produced
next
to
baxter
the
first
characteristic
of
scottish
presbyterianism
is
the
absence
of
a
theology
the
only
considerable
divines
that
have
appeared
in
scotland
since
the
reformation
leighton
and
forbes
were
prelates
of
the
episcopal
church
calvinism
was
unable
to
produce
a
theological
literature
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
english
writers
of
the
example
of
holland
and
of
the
great
natural
intelligence
of
the
scots
their
theology
says
a
distinguished
lutheran
divine
possesses
no
system
of
christian
ethics
this
döllinger
attributes
to
the
strictness
with
which
they
have
held
to
the
doctrine
of
imputation
which
is
incompatible
with
any
system
of
moral
theology
in
other
countries
it
was
the
same
where
that
doctrine
prevailed
there
was
no
ethical
system
and
where
ethics
were
cultivated
the
doctrine
was
abandoned
for
a
century
after
luther
no
moral
theology
was
written
in
germany
the
first
who
attempted
it
calixtus
gave
up
the
lutheran
doctrine
the
dutch
historians
of
calvinism
in
the
netherlands
record
in
like
manner
that
there
the
dread
of
a
collision
with
the
dogma
silenced
the
teaching
of
ethics
both
in
literature
and
at
the
universities
accordingly
all
the
great
protestant
moralists
were
opposed
to
the
protestant
doctrine
of
justification
in
scotland
the
intellectual
lethargy
of
churchmen
is
not
confined
to
the
department
of
ethics
and
presbyterianism
only
prolongs
its
existence
by
suppressing
theological
writing
and
by
concealing
the
contradictions
which
would
otherwise
bring
down
on
the
clergy
the
contempt
of
their
flocks
whilst
scotland
has
clung
to
the
original
dogma
of
calvin
at
the
price
of
complete
theological
stagnation
the
dutch
church
has
lost
its
primitive
orthodoxy
in
the
progress
of
theological
learning
not
one
of
the
several
schools
into
which
the
clergy
of
the
netherlands
are
divided
has
remained
faithful
to
the
five
articles
of
the
synod
of
dortrecht
which
still
command
so
extensive
an
allegiance
in
great
britain
and
america
the
conservative
party
headed
by
the
statesman
and
historian
groen
van
prinsterer
who
holds
fast
to
the
theology
which
is
so
closely
interwoven
with
the
history
of
his
country
and
with
the
fortunes
of
the
reigning
house
and
who
invokes
the
aid
of
the
secular
arm
in
support
of
pure
calvinism
is
not
represented
at
the
universities
for
all
the
dutch
divines
know
that
the
system
can
not
be
revived
without
sacrificing
the
theological
activity
by
which
it
has
been
extinguished
the
old
confessional
writings
have
lost
their
authority
and
the
general
synod
of
decided
that
as
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
all
opinions
and
wishes
even
in
the
shortest
confession
the
church
tolerates
divergence
from
the
symbolical
books
the
only
unity
says
groen
consists
in
this
that
all
the
preachers
are
paid
out
of
the
same
fund
the
bulk
of
the
clergy
are
arminians
or
socinians
from
the
spectacle
of
the
dutch
church
döllinger
comes
to
the
following
result
first
that
without
a
code
of
doctrine
laid
down
in
authoritative
confessions
of
faith
the
church
can
not
endure
secondly
that
the
old
confessional
writings
can
not
be
maintained
and
are
universally
given
up
and
thirdly
that
it
is
impossible
to
draw
up
new
ones
french
protestantism
suffered
less
from
the
revolution
than
the
catholic
church
and
was
treated
with
tenderness
and
sometimes
with
favour
the
dissolution
of
continental
protestantism
began
in
france
before
their
expulsion
in
the
french
divines
had
cast
off
the
yoke
of
the
dortrecht
articles
and
in
their
exile
they
afterwards
promoted
the
decline
of
calvinism
in
the
netherlands
the
old
calvinistic
tradition
has
never
been
restored
the
works
of
the
early
writers
are
forgotten
no
new
theological
literature
has
arisen
and
the
influence
of
germany
has
borne
no
considerable
fruit
the
evangelical
party
or
methodists
as
they
are
called
are
accused
by
the
rest
of
being
the
cause
of
their
present
melancholy
state
the
rationalism
of
the
generally
prevails
among
the
clergy
either
in
the
shape
of
the
naturalism
of
the
eighteenth
century
coquerel
or
in
the
more
advanced
form
of
modern
criticism
as
it
is
carried
out
by
the
faculty
of
strasburg
with
the
aid
of
german
infidelity
payment
by
the
state
and
hatred
of
catholicism
are
the
only
common
marks
of
french
protestant
divines
they
have
no
doctrine
no
discipline
no
symbol
no
theology
nobody
can
define
the
principle
or
the
limits
of
their
community
the
calvinism
of
switzerland
has
been
ruined
in
its
doctrine
by
the
progress
of
theology
and
in
its
constitution
by
the
progress
of
democracy
in
geneva
the
church
of
calvin
fell
in
the
revolutions
of
and
the
symbolical
books
are
abolished
the
doctrine
is
based
on
the
bible
but
the
right
of
free
inquiry
is
granted
to
all
the
ruling
body
consists
of
laymen
the
faith
of
our
fathers
says
merle
counts
but
a
small
group
of
adherents
amongst
us
in
the
canton
of
vaud
where
the
whole
ecclesiastical
power
was
in
the
hands
of
the
government
the
yoke
of
the
democracy
became
insupportable
and
the
excellent
writer
vinet
seceded
with
ministers
out
of
the
people
of
berne
are
among
the
most
bitter
enemies
of
catholicism
in
europe
their
fanaticism
crushed
the
sonderbund
but
the
recoil
drove
them
towards
infidelity
and
hastened
the
decrease
of
devotion
and
of
the
influence
of
the
clergy
none
of
the
german
swiss
and
few
of
the
french
retain
in
its
purity
the
system
of
calvin
the
unbelief
of
the
clergy
lays
the
church
open
to
the
attacks
of
a
democracy
a
swiss
protestant
divine
said
recently
only
a
church
with
a
catholic
organisation
could
have
maintained
itself
without
a
most
extraordinary
descent
of
the
holy
spirit
against
the
assaults
of
rationalism
what
we
want
says
another
in
order
to
have
a
free
church
is
pastors
and
flocks
dogs
and
wolves
there
are
in
plenty
in
america
it
is
rare
to
find
people
who
are
openly
irreligious
except
some
of
the
germans
all
protestants
generally
admit
the
truth
of
christianity
and
the
authority
of
scripture
but
above
half
of
the
american
population
belongs
to
no
particular
sect
and
performs
no
religious
functions
this
is
the
result
of
the
voluntary
principle
of
the
dominion
of
the
sects
and
of
the
absence
of
an
established
church
to
receive
each
individual
from
his
birth
to
adopt
him
by
baptism
and
to
bring
him
up
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
religious
life
the
majority
of
men
will
naturally
take
refuge
in
indifference
and
neutrality
from
the
conflict
of
opinions
and
will
persuade
themselves
that
where
there
are
so
many
competitors
none
can
be
the
lawful
spouse
yet
there
is
a
blessing
on
everything
that
is
christian
which
can
never
be
entirely
effaced
or
converted
into
a
curse
whatever
the
imperfections
of
the
form
in
which
it
exists
the
errors
mixed
up
with
it
or
the
degrading
influence
of
human
passion
christianity
never
ceases
to
work
immeasurable
social
good
but
the
great
theological
characteristic
of
american
protestantism
is
the
absence
of
the
notion
of
the
church
the
prevailing
belief
is
that
in
times
past
there
was
always
a
war
of
opinions
and
of
parties
that
there
never
was
one
unbroken
vessel
and
that
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
put
up
with
fragments
one
of
which
is
nearly
as
good
as
another
sectarianism
it
is
vaguely
supposed
is
the
normal
condition
of
religion
now
a
sect
is
by
its
very
nature
instinctively
adverse
to
a
scientific
theology
it
feels
that
it
is
without
a
history
and
unconnected
with
the
main
stream
of
ecclesiastical
progress
and
it
is
inspired
with
hatred
and
with
contempt
for
the
past
for
its
teaching
and
its
writings
practically
sectaries
hold
that
a
tradition
is
the
more
surely
to
be
rejected
the
older
it
is
and
the
more
valuable
in
proportion
to
the
lateness
of
its
origin
as
a
consequence
of
the
want
of
roots
in
the
past
and
of
the
thirst
for
novelty
the
history
of
those
sects
which
are
not
sunk
in
lethargy
consists
in
sudden
transitions
to
opposite
extremes
in
the
religious
world
ill
weeds
grow
apace
and
those
communities
which
strike
root
spring
up
and
extend
most
rapidly
are
the
least
durable
and
the
least
respectable
the
sects
of
europe
were
transplanted
into
america
but
there
the
impatience
of
authority
which
is
the
basis
of
social
and
political
life
has
produced
in
religion
a
variety
and
a
multiplicity
of
which
europe
has
no
experience
whilst
these
are
the
fruits
of
religious
liberty
and
ecclesiastical
independence
among
a
people
generally
educated
the
danish
monarchy
exhibits
unity
of
faith
strictly
maintained
by
keeping
the
people
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
upper
class
on
whose
behalf
the
reformation
was
introduced
and
in
a
state
of
ignorance
corresponding
to
their
oppression
care
was
taken
that
they
should
not
obtain
religious
instruction
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
celebrated
bishop
pontoppidan
says
an
almost
heathen
blindness
pervades
the
land
about
the
same
time
the
norwegian
prelates
declared
in
a
petition
to
the
king
of
denmark
if
we
except
a
few
children
of
god
there
is
only
this
difference
between
us
and
our
heathen
ancestors
that
we
bear
the
name
of
christians
the
danish
church
has
given
no
signs
of
life
and
has
shown
no
desire
for
independence
since
the
reformation
and
in
return
for
this
submissiveness
the
government
suppressed
every
tendency
towards
dissent
things
were
not
altered
when
the
tyranny
of
the
nobles
gave
way
to
the
tyranny
of
the
crown
but
when
the
revolution
of
had
given
the
state
a
democratic
basis
its
confessional
character
was
abrogated
and
whilst
lutheranism
was
declared
the
national
religion
conformity
was
no
longer
exacted
the
king
is
still
the
head
of
the
church
and
is
the
only
man
in
denmark
who
must
be
a
lutheran
no
form
of
ecclesiastical
government
suitable
to
the
new
order
of
things
has
yet
been
devised
and
the
majority
prefer
to
remain
in
the
present
provisional
state
subject
to
the
will
of
a
parliament
not
one
member
of
which
need
belong
to
the
church
which
it
governs
among
the
clergy
those
who
are
not
rationalists
follow
the
lead
of
grundtvig
during
many
years
this
able
man
has
conducted
an
incessant
resistance
against
the
progress
of
unbelief
and
of
the
german
influence
and
against
the
lutheran
system
the
royal
supremacy
and
the
parochial
constitution
not
unlike
the
tractarians
he
desires
the
liberty
of
establishing
a
system
which
shall
exclude
lutheranism
rationalism
and
erastianism
and
he
has
united
in
his
school
nearly
all
who
profess
positive
christianity
in
denmark
in
copenhagen
out
of
inhabitants
only
go
regularly
to
church
in
altona
there
is
but
one
church
for
people
in
schleswig
the
churches
are
few
and
empty
the
great
evil
says
a
schleswig
divine
is
not
the
oppression
which
falls
on
the
german
tongue
but
the
irreligion
and
consequent
demoralisation
which
denmark
has
imported
into
schleswig
a
moral
and
religious
tone
is
the
exception
not
the
rule
among
the
danish
clergy
the
theological
literature
of
sweden
consists
almost
entirely
of
translations
from
the
german
the
clergy
by
renouncing
study
have
escaped
rationalism
and
remain
faithful
to
the
lutheran
system
the
king
is
supreme
in
spirituals
and
the
diet
discusses
and
determines
religious
questions
the
clergy
as
one
of
the
estates
has
great
political
influence
but
no
ecclesiastical
independence
no
other
protestant
clergy
possesses
equal
privileges
or
less
freedom
it
is
usual
for
the
minister
after
the
sermon
to
read
out
a
number
of
trivial
local
announcements
sometimes
half
an
hour
long
and
in
a
late
assembly
the
majority
of
the
bishops
pronounced
in
favour
of
retaining
this
custom
as
none
but
old
women
and
children
would
come
to
church
for
the
service
alone
in
no
other
country
in
europe
is
the
strict
lutheran
system
preached
but
in
sweden
the
doctrine
is
preserved
but
religion
is
dead
and
the
church
is
as
silent
and
as
peaceful
as
the
churchyard
the
church
is
richly
endowed
there
are
great
universities
and
swedes
are
among
the
foremost
in
almost
every
branch
of
science
but
no
swedish
writer
has
ever
done
anything
for
religious
thought
the
example
of
denmark
and
its
rationalist
clergy
brought
home
to
them
the
consequences
of
theological
study
in
one
place
the
old
system
has
been
preserved
like
a
frail
and
delicate
curiosity
by
excluding
the
air
of
scientific
inquiry
whilst
in
the
other
lutheranism
is
decomposing
under
its
influence
in
norway
where
the
clergy
have
no
political
representation
religious
liberty
was
established
in
throughout
the
north
of
europe
the
helpless
decline
of
protestantism
is
betrayed
by
the
numerical
disproportion
of
preachers
to
the
people
norway
with
a
population
of
thinly
scattered
over
a
very
large
territory
has
parishes
with
an
average
of
souls
apiece
but
the
clergy
are
pluralists
and
as
many
as
five
parishes
are
often
united
under
a
single
incumbent
holstein
has
only
preachers
for
an
almost
exclusively
lutheran
population
of
in
schleswig
many
parishes
have
been
deserted
because
they
were
too
poor
to
maintain
a
clergyman
family
sometimes
there
are
only
two
ministers
for
persons
in
the
baltic
provinces
the
proportion
is
one
to
in
this
way
the
people
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
clergy
with
families
to
support
the
most
brilliant
and
important
part
of
this
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
state
of
protestantism
in
the
author
native
country
he
speaks
with
the
greatest
authority
and
effect
when
he
comes
near
home
describes
the
opinions
of
men
who
have
been
his
rivals
in
literature
or
his
adversaries
in
controversy
and
touches
on
discussions
which
his
own
writings
have
influenced
there
is
a
difference
also
in
the
tone
when
he
speaks
of
the
state
of
other
countries
with
which
he
has
made
himself
acquainted
as
a
traveller
or
through
the
writings
of
others
he
preserves
the
calmness
and
objectivity
of
a
historian
and
adds
few
reflections
to
the
simple
description
of
facts
but
in
approaching
the
scenes
and
the
thoughts
of
his
own
country
the
interests
and
the
most
immediate
occupations
of
his
own
life
the
familiarity
of
long
experience
gives
greater
confidence
warmth
and
vigour
to
his
touch
the
historian
gives
way
to
the
divine
and
the
narrative
sometimes
slides
into
theology
besides
the
position
of
the
author
the
difference
of
the
subject
justifies
a
change
in
the
treatment
the
examination
of
protestantism
in
the
rest
of
the
world
pointed
with
monotonous
uniformity
to
a
single
conclusion
everywhere
there
was
the
same
spectacle
and
the
same
alternative
either
religion
sacrificed
to
the
advancement
of
learning
or
learning
relinquished
for
the
preservation
of
religion
everywhere
the
same
antagonism
between
intellectual
progress
and
fidelity
to
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
protestantism
either
religion
has
become
stark
and
stagnant
in
states
which
protect
unity
by
the
proscription
of
knowledge
or
the
progress
of
thought
and
inquiry
has
undermined
belief
in
the
protestant
system
and
driven
its
professors
from
one
untenable
position
to
another
or
the
ascendency
of
the
sectarian
spirit
has
been
equally
fatal
to
its
dogmatic
integrity
and
to
its
intellectual
development
but
in
the
home
of
the
reformation
a
league
has
been
concluded
in
our
time
between
theology
and
religion
and
many
schools
of
protestant
divines
are
labouring
with
a
vast
expenditure
of
ability
and
learning
to
devise
or
to
restore
with
the
aid
of
theological
science
a
system
of
positive
christianity
into
this
great
scene
of
intellectual
exertion
and
doctrinal
confusion
the
leading
adversary
of
protestantism
in
germany
conducts
his
readers
not
without
sympathy
for
the
high
aims
which
inspire
the
movement
but
with
the
almost
triumphant
security
which
belongs
to
a
church
possessing
an
acknowledged
authority
a
definite
organisation
and
a
system
brought
down
by
tradition
from
the
apostolic
age
passing
by
the
schools
of
infidelity
which
have
no
bearing
on
the
topic
of
his
work
he
addresses
himself
to
the
believing
protestantism
of
germany
and
considers
its
efforts
to
obtain
a
position
which
may
enable
it
to
resist
unbelief
without
involving
submission
to
the
church
the
character
of
luther
separates
the
german
protestants
from
those
of
other
countries
his
was
the
in
whom
his
contemporaries
beheld
the
incarnation
of
the
genius
of
their
nation
in
the
strong
lineaments
of
his
character
they
recognised
in
heroic
proportions
the
reflection
of
their
own
and
thus
his
name
has
survived
not
merely
as
that
of
a
great
man
the
mightiest
of
his
age
but
as
the
type
of
a
whole
period
in
the
history
of
the
german
people
the
centre
of
a
new
world
of
ideas
the
personification
of
those
religious
and
ethical
opinions
which
the
country
followed
and
whose
influence
even
their
adversaries
could
not
escape
his
writings
have
long
ceased
to
be
popular
and
are
read
only
as
monuments
of
history
but
the
memory
of
his
person
has
not
yet
grown
dim
his
name
is
still
a
power
in
his
own
country
and
from
its
magic
the
protestant
doctrine
derives
a
portion
of
its
life
in
other
countries
men
dislike
to
be
described
by
the
name
of
the
founder
of
their
religious
system
but
in
germany
and
sweden
there
are
thousands
who
are
proud
of
the
name
of
lutheran
the
results
of
his
system
prevail
in
the
more
influential
and
intelligent
classes
and
penetrate
the
mass
of
the
modern
literature
of
germany
the
reformation
had
introduced
the
notion
that
christianity
was
a
failure
and
had
brought
far
more
suffering
than
blessings
on
mankind
and
the
consequences
of
that
movement
were
not
calculated
to
impress
educated
men
with
the
belief
that
things
were
changed
for
the
better
or
that
the
reformers
had
achieved
the
work
in
which
the
apostles
were
unsuccessful
thus
an
atmosphere
of
unbelief
and
of
contempt
for
everything
christian
gradually
arose
and
paganism
appeared
more
cheerful
more
human
and
more
poetical
than
the
repulsive
galilean
doctrine
of
holiness
and
privation
this
spirit
still
governs
the
educated
class
christianity
is
abominated
both
in
life
and
in
literature
even
under
the
form
of
believing
protestantism
in
germany
theological
study
and
the
lutheran
system
subsisted
for
two
centuries
together
the
controversies
that
arose
from
time
to
time
developed
the
theory
but
brought
out
by
degrees
its
inward
contradictions
the
danger
of
biblical
studies
was
well
understood
and
the
scriptures
were
almost
universally
excluded
from
the
universities
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
bengel
revived
the
study
of
the
bible
and
the
dissolution
of
the
lutheran
doctrine
began
the
rise
of
historical
learning
hastened
the
process
frederic
the
great
says
of
himself
that
the
notion
that
the
history
of
the
church
is
a
drama
conducted
by
rogues
and
hypocrites
at
the
expense
of
the
deceived
masses
was
the
real
cause
of
his
contempt
for
the
christian
religion
the
lutheran
theology
taught
that
after
the
apostolic
age
god
withdrew
from
the
church
and
abandoned
to
the
devil
the
office
which
according
to
the
gospel
was
reserved
for
the
holy
spirit
this
diabolical
millennium
lasted
till
the
appearance
of
luther
as
soon
therefore
as
the
reverence
for
the
symbolical
books
began
to
wane
the
belief
in
the
divine
foundation
departed
with
the
belief
in
the
divine
guidance
of
the
church
and
the
root
was
judged
by
the
stem
the
beginning
by
the
continuation
as
research
went
on
unfettered
now
by
the
authorities
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
clergy
became
rationalists
and
stone
after
stone
of
the
temple
was
carried
away
by
its
own
priests
the
infidelity
which
at
the
same
time
flourished
in
france
did
not
on
the
whole
infect
the
priesthood
but
in
germany
it
was
the
divines
who
destroyed
religion
the
pastors
who
impelled
their
flocks
to
renounce
the
christian
faith
in
the
prussian
union
added
a
new
church
to
the
two
original
forms
of
protestantism
but
strict
calvinism
is
nearly
extinct
in
germany
and
the
old
lutheran
church
itself
has
almost
disappeared
it
subsists
not
in
any
definite
reality
but
only
in
the
aspirations
of
certain
divines
and
jurists
the
purpose
of
the
union
was
to
bring
together
in
religious
communion
the
reigning
family
of
prussia
which
had
adopted
calvinism
in
and
the
vast
lutheran
majority
among
the
people
it
was
to
be
in
the
words
of
the
king
a
merely
ritual
union
not
an
amalgamation
of
dogmas
in
some
places
there
was
resistance
which
was
put
down
by
military
execution
some
thousands
emigrated
to
america
but
the
public
press
applauded
the
measures
and
there
was
no
general
indignation
at
their
severity
the
lutherans
justly
perceived
that
the
union
would
promote
religious
indifference
but
at
the
accession
of
the
late
king
there
came
a
change
religious
faith
was
once
more
sought
after
believing
professors
were
appointed
in
almost
all
the
german
universities
after
the
example
of
prussia
jena
and
giessen
alone
continued
to
be
seats
of
rationalism
as
soon
as
theology
had
begun
to
recover
a
more
religious
and
christian
character
two
very
divergent
tendencies
manifested
themselves
among
the
disciples
of
schleiermacher
and
of
neander
a
school
of
unionists
arose
who
attempted
a
conciliatory
intermediate
theology
at
the
same
time
a
strictly
lutheran
theology
flourished
at
the
universities
of
erlangen
leipzig
rostock
and
dorpat
which
sought
to
revive
the
doctrine
of
the
sixteenth
century
clothed
in
the
language
of
the
nineteenth
but
for
men
versed
in
scripture
theology
this
was
an
impossible
enterprise
and
it
was
abandoned
by
the
divines
to
a
number
of
parochial
clergymen
who
are
represented
in
literature
by
rudelbach
and
who
claim
to
be
the
only
surviving
protestants
whom
luther
would
acknowledge
as
his
sons
and
the
heirs
of
his
spirit
the
lutheran
divines
and
scholars
formed
the
new
lutheran
party
whose
most
illustrious
lay
champion
was
the
celebrated
stahl
they
profess
the
lutheran
doctrine
of
justification
but
reject
the
notion
of
the
invisible
church
and
the
universal
priesthood
holding
to
the
divine
institution
of
the
offices
of
the
church
in
opposition
to
the
view
which
refers
them
to
the
congregation
they
are
led
to
assume
a
sacrament
of
orders
and
to
express
opinions
on
ordination
sacraments
and
sacrifice
which
involve
them
in
the
imputation
of
puseyism
or
even
of
catholicism
as
they
remain
for
the
most
part
in
the
state
church
there
is
an
open
war
between
their
confessional
spirit
and
the
syncretism
of
the
union
in
the
evangelical
alliance
met
at
berlin
in
order
to
strengthen
the
unionist
principles
and
to
testify
against
these
pharisees
baptists
methodists
and
presbyterians
sects
connected
by
nothing
but
a
common
hatred
of
catholicism
were
greeted
by
the
union
divines
as
bone
of
their
bone
and
welcome
allies
in
the
contest
with
an
exclusive
lutheranism
and
with
rome
the
confusion
in
the
minds
of
the
people
was
increased
by
this
spectacle
the
union
already
implied
that
the
dogma
of
the
lord
supper
on
which
lutherans
and
calvinists
disagree
was
uncertain
and
therefore
not
essential
the
alliance
of
so
many
denominations
added
baptism
to
the
list
of
things
about
which
nothing
is
positively
known
the
author
of
this
measure
was
bunsen
who
was
full
of
the
idea
of
uniting
all
protestant
sects
in
a
union
against
the
catholic
church
and
catholicising
tendencies
for
the
last
fifteen
years
there
has
been
an
active
agitation
for
the
improvement
of
the
church
among
the
protestant
divines
the
first
question
that
occupies
and
divides
them
is
that
of
church
government
and
the
royal
episcopate
which
many
deem
the
chief
cause
of
the
ecclesiastical
decay
the
late
king
of
prussia
a
zealous
and
enlightened
friend
of
the
protestant
church
declared
that
the
territorial
system
and
the
episcopal
authority
of
the
sovereign
are
of
such
a
nature
that
either
of
them
would
alone
be
enough
to
kill
the
church
if
the
church
was
mortal
and
that
he
longed
to
be
able
to
abdicate
his
rights
into
the
hands
of
the
bishops
in
other
countries
as
in
baden
a
new
system
has
been
devised
which
transfers
political
constitutionalism
to
the
church
and
makes
it
a
community
not
of
those
who
believe
in
christ
but
in
the
words
of
the
government
organ
of
those
who
believe
in
a
moral
order
hopes
were
entertained
that
the
introduction
of
synods
would
be
an
improvement
and
in
and
a
beginning
was
made
at
berlin
but
it
was
found
that
the
existence
of
great
evils
and
disorders
in
the
church
which
had
been
a
secret
of
the
initiated
would
be
published
to
the
world
and
that
government
by
majorities
the
ecclesiastical
democracy
which
was
bunsen
ideal
would
soon
destroy
every
vestige
of
christianity
in
their
doctrinal
and
theological
literature
resides
at
the
present
day
the
strength
and
the
renown
of
the
protestants
for
a
scientific
protestant
theology
exists
only
in
germany
the
german
protestant
church
is
emphatically
a
church
of
theologians
they
are
its
only
authority
and
through
the
princes
its
supreme
rulers
its
founder
never
really
divested
himself
of
the
character
of
a
professor
and
the
church
has
never
emancipated
itself
from
the
it
teaches
and
then
disappears
its
hymns
are
not
real
hymns
but
versified
theological
dissertations
or
sermons
in
rhyme
born
of
the
union
of
princes
with
professors
it
retains
the
distinct
likeness
of
both
its
parents
not
altogether
harmoniously
blended
and
when
it
is
accused
of
worldliness
of
paleness
of
thought
of
being
a
police
institution
rather
than
a
church
that
is
no
more
than
to
say
that
the
child
can
not
deny
its
parentage
theology
has
become
believing
in
germany
but
it
is
very
far
from
being
orthodox
no
writer
is
true
to
the
literal
teaching
of
the
symbolical
books
and
for
a
hundred
years
the
pure
doctrine
of
the
sixteenth
century
has
never
been
heard
no
german
divine
could
submit
to
the
authority
of
the
early
articles
and
formulas
without
hypocrisy
and
violence
to
his
conscience
and
yet
they
have
nothing
else
to
appeal
to
that
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
only
is
the
principal
substance
of
the
symbolical
writings
the
centre
of
the
antagonism
against
the
catholic
church
all
are
agreed
the
proclaim
it
the
essence
and
treasure
of
the
reformation
the
doctrine
of
which
every
man
must
have
a
clear
and
vivid
comprehension
who
would
know
anything
of
christianity
the
banner
which
must
be
unfurled
at
least
once
in
every
sermon
the
permanent
death
that
gnaws
the
bones
of
catholics
the
standard
by
which
the
whole
of
the
gospel
must
be
interpreted
and
every
obscure
passage
explained
and
yet
this
article
of
a
standing
or
falling
church
on
the
strength
of
which
protestants
call
themselves
evangelical
is
accepted
by
scarcely
one
of
their
more
eminent
divines
even
among
the
lutherans
the
progress
of
biblical
studies
is
too
great
to
admit
of
a
return
to
the
doctrine
which
has
been
exploded
by
the
advancement
of
religious
learning
döllinger
gives
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
leading
theologians
by
all
of
whom
it
has
been
abandoned
yet
it
was
for
the
sake
of
this
fundamental
and
essential
doctrine
that
the
epistle
of
james
was
pronounced
an
epistle
of
straw
that
the
augsburg
confession
declared
it
to
have
been
the
belief
of
st
augustine
and
that
when
the
author
of
the
confession
had
for
very
shame
omitted
this
falsehood
in
the
published
edition
the
passage
was
restored
after
his
death
for
its
sake
luther
deliberately
altered
the
sense
of
several
passages
in
the
bible
especially
in
the
writings
of
paul
to
save
this
doctrine
which
was
unknown
to
all
christian
antiquity
the
breach
was
made
with
all
ecclesiastical
tradition
and
the
authority
of
the
dogmatic
testimony
of
the
church
in
every
age
was
rejected
while
the
contradiction
between
the
lutheran
doctrine
and
that
of
the
first
centuries
was
disguised
before
the
laity
it
was
no
secret
among
the
reformers
melanchthon
confessed
to
brenz
that
in
the
augsburg
confession
he
had
lied
luther
admitted
that
his
theory
was
new
and
sought
in
consequence
to
destroy
the
authority
of
the
early
fathers
and
councils
calvin
declared
that
the
system
was
unknown
to
tradition
all
these
men
and
their
disciples
and
the
whole
of
the
lutheran
and
calvinistic
theology
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
professed
to
find
their
doctrine
of
imputation
laid
down
distinctly
in
the
bible
the
whole
modern
scientific
theology
of
the
protestants
rejects
both
the
doctrine
and
the
lutheran
exegesis
of
the
passages
in
question
but
it
is
the
supreme
evangelical
principle
that
the
scripture
is
perfectly
clear
and
sufficient
on
all
fundamental
points
yet
the
point
on
which
this
great
divergence
subsists
is
a
doctrine
which
is
decisive
for
the
existence
of
the
church
and
most
important
in
its
practical
influence
on
life
the
whole
edifice
of
the
protestant
church
and
theology
reposes
therefore
on
two
principles
one
material
the
other
formal
the
doctrine
of
imputation
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
bible
but
the
material
principle
is
given
up
by
exegesis
and
by
dogmatic
theology
and
as
to
the
formal
principle
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
bible
or
even
for
the
inspiration
of
the
writings
of
the
disciples
of
the
apostles
not
the
shadow
of
a
scriptural
argument
can
be
adduced
the
significance
of
this
great
fact
is
beginning
to
make
its
way
whilst
rationalism
prevailed
says
a
famous
lutheran
divine
we
could
impute
to
its
action
that
our
churches
were
deserted
and
empty
but
now
that
christ
crucified
is
everywhere
preached
and
no
serious
effect
is
to
be
observed
it
is
necessary
to
abandon
this
mistake
and
not
to
conceal
from
ourselves
that
preaching
is
unable
to
revive
religious
life
the
religious
indifference
of
the
educated
classes
is
the
chief
security
for
the
existence
of
the
protestant
church
if
they
were
to
take
an
interest
in
matters
of
worship
and
doctrine
and
to
inform
themselves
as
to
the
present
relation
of
theological
science
to
the
teaching
of
the
pulpit
the
day
of
discovery
and
exposure
would
come
and
confidence
in
the
church
would
be
at
an
end
the
dishonesty
of
luther
in
those
very
things
on
which
the
reformation
depended
could
not
be
concealed
from
them
in
prussia
there
was
a
conscientious
clergyman
who
taught
his
parishioners
greek
and
then
showed
them
all
the
passages
especially
in
the
epistles
of
paul
which
were
intentionally
altered
in
the
translation
but
one
of
the
protestant
leaders
impresses
on
the
clergy
the
danger
of
allowing
the
people
to
know
that
which
ought
to
be
kept
a
secret
among
the
learned
at
most
he
says
it
may
be
necessary
to
admit
that
the
translation
is
not
perspicuous
the
danger
of
this
discovery
does
not
however
appear
to
be
immediate
for
no
book
is
less
familiar
to
the
laity
than
the
bible
there
is
scarcely
one
christian
family
in
a
hundred
says
tholuck
in
which
the
holy
scriptures
are
read
in
the
midst
of
this
general
downfall
of
christianity
in
spite
of
the
great
efforts
of
protestants
some
take
refuge
in
the
phrase
of
an
invisible
church
some
in
a
church
of
the
future
whilst
there
exists
a
real
living
universal
church
with
a
settled
system
and
means
of
salvation
the
invisible
church
is
offered
in
her
stead
wrapped
up
in
the
swaddling
clothes
of
rhetoric
like
the
stone
which
rhea
gave
her
husband
instead
of
the
child
in
a
novel
of
jean
paul
a
swedish
clergyman
is
advised
in
the
middle
of
winter
to
walk
about
with
a
bit
of
in
his
mouth
in
order
to
realise
with
all
his
senses
the
sunny
climes
of
the
south
it
requires
as
much
imagination
to
realise
the
church
by
taking
a
spiritual
league
into
one
mouth
another
acknowledgment
that
the
church
has
become
estranged
from
the
people
and
subsists
only
as
a
ruin
of
a
past
age
is
the
widely
spread
hope
of
a
new
pentecost
eminent
theologians
speak
of
it
as
the
only
conceivable
salvation
though
there
is
no
such
promise
in
scripture
no
example
in
history
of
a
similar
desire
they
rest
their
only
hope
in
a
miracle
such
as
has
not
happened
since
the
apostles
and
thereby
confess
that
in
the
normal
process
of
religious
life
by
which
christ
has
guided
his
church
till
now
their
cause
is
lost
a
symptom
of
the
same
despair
is
the
rise
of
chiliastic
aspirations
and
the
belief
in
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
to
this
party
belongs
the
present
minister
of
public
worship
and
education
in
berlin
shortly
before
his
appointment
he
wrote
both
church
and
state
must
perish
in
their
earthly
forms
that
the
kingdom
of
christ
may
be
set
up
over
all
nations
that
the
bride
of
the
lamb
the
perfect
community
the
new
jerusalem
may
descend
from
heaven
not
long
before
this
was
published
another
prussian
statesman
bunsen
had
warned
his
protestant
readers
to
turn
away
from
false
prophets
who
announce
the
end
of
the
world
because
they
have
come
to
the
end
of
their
own
wisdom
in
the
midst
of
this
desperate
weakness
although
catholics
and
protestants
are
so
mixed
up
with
each
other
that
toleration
must
soon
be
universal
throughout
germany
the
thoughts
of
the
protestants
are
yet
not
turned
towards
the
catholic
church
they
still
show
a
bitter
animosity
against
her
and
the
reproach
of
catholic
tendencies
has
for
twenty
years
been
the
strongest
argument
against
every
attempt
to
revive
religion
and
worship
the
attitude
of
protestantism
towards
rome
says
stahl
is
that
of
the
borghese
gladiator
to
soften
this
spirit
of
animosity
the
only
possible
resource
is
to
make
it
clear
to
all
protestants
who
still
hold
to
christianity
what
their
own
internal
condition
is
and
what
they
have
come
to
by
their
rejection
of
the
unity
and
the
authority
which
the
catholic
church
possesses
in
the
holy
see
having
shown
the
value
of
the
papacy
by
the
results
which
have
ensued
on
its
rejection
döllinger
proceeds
with
the
same
truth
and
impartiality
to
trace
the
events
which
have
injured
the
influence
and
diminished
the
glory
and
attractiveness
of
the
holy
see
and
have
converted
that
which
should
be
the
safeguard
of
its
spiritual
freedom
into
a
calamity
and
a
dishonour
in
the
eyes
of
mankind
it
seems
as
though
he
wished
to
point
out
as
the
moral
to
be
learnt
from
the
present
condition
of
the
religious
world
that
there
is
a
coincidence
in
time
and
in
providential
purpose
between
the
exhaustion
and
the
despair
at
which
enlightened
protestantism
has
arrived
from
the
failure
of
every
attempt
to
organise
a
form
of
church
government
to
save
the
people
from
infidelity
and
to
reconcile
theological
knowledge
with
their
religious
faith
between
this
and
that
great
drama
which
by
destroying
the
bonds
which
linked
the
church
to
an
untenable
system
is
preparing
the
restoration
of
the
holy
see
to
its
former
independence
and
to
its
just
influence
over
the
minds
of
men
the
popes
after
obtaining
a
virtual
independence
under
the
byzantine
sceptre
transferred
their
allegiance
to
the
revived
empire
of
the
west
the
line
between
their
authority
and
that
of
the
emperor
in
rome
was
never
clearly
drawn
it
was
a
security
for
the
freedom
and
regularity
of
the
election
which
was
made
by
the
lay
as
well
as
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
of
the
city
that
it
should
be
subject
to
the
imperial
ratification
but
the
remoteness
of
the
emperors
and
the
inconvenience
of
delay
caused
this
rule
to
be
often
broken
this
prosperous
period
did
not
long
continue
when
the
dynasty
of
charlemagne
came
to
an
end
the
roman
clergy
had
no
defence
against
the
nobles
and
the
romans
did
all
that
men
could
do
to
ruin
the
papacy
there
was
little
remaining
of
the
state
which
the
popes
had
formed
in
conjunction
with
the
emperors
in
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
the
exarchate
and
the
pentapolis
were
in
the
power
of
berengarius
and
rome
in
the
hands
of
the
senator

that
a
secular
principality

who
became
pope
john
xii
otho
the
great
who
had
restored
the
empire
and
claimed
to
exercise
its
old
prerogative
deposed
the
new
pope
and
when
the
romans
elected
another
sent
him
also
into
exile
beyond
the
alps
for
a
whole
century
after
this
time
there
was
no
trace
of
freedom
of
election
without
the
emperor
the
popes
were
in
the
hands
of
the
roman
factions
and
dependence
on
the
emperor
was
better
for
the
church
than
dependence
on
the
nobles
the
popes
appointed
under
the
influence
of
the
prelates
who
were
the
ecclesiastical
advisers
of
the
imperial
government
were
preferable
to
the
nominees
of
the
roman
chiefs
who
had
no
object
or
consideration
but
their
own
ambition
and
were
inclined
to
speculate
on
the
worthlessness
of
their
candidates
during
the
first
half
of
the
eleventh
century
they
recovered
their
predominance
and
the
deliverance
of
the
church
came
once
more
from
germany
a
succession
of
german
popes
named
by
the
emperor
opened
the
way
for
the
permanent
reform
which
is
associated
with
the
name
of
gregory
vii
up
to
this
period
the
security
of
the
freedom
of
the
holy
see
was
the
protection
of
the
emperor
and
gregory
was
the
last
pope
who
asked
for
the
imperial
confirmation
between
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
and
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
the
greater
part
of
the
roman
territory
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
laymen
some
portions
were
possessed
by
the
emperor
some
by
the
great
italian
families
and
the
revenues
of
the
pope
were
derived
from
the
tribute
of
his
vassals

complains
that
this
was
very
small
as
the
possessions
of
the
church
had
been
given
away
for
very
little
besides
the
tribute
the
vassals
owed
feudal
service
to
the
pope
but
the
government
was
not
in
his
hands
and
the
imperial
suzerainty
remained
the
great
families
had
obtained
from
the
popes
of
their
making
such
extensive
grants
that
there
was
little
remaining
and
otho
iii
tried
to
make
up
for
it
by
a
new
donation
the
loss
of
the
patrimonies
in
southern
italy
established
a
claim
on
the
norman
conquerors
and
they
became
papal
vassals
for
the
kingdom
of
sicily
but
throughout
the
twelfth
century
the
popes
had
no
firm
basis
of
their
power
in
italy
they
were
not
always
masters
of
rome
and
there
was
not
a
single
provincial
town
they
could
reckon
on
seven
popes
in
a
hundred
years

a
refuge
in
france
two
remained
at

the
donation
of
matilda
was
disputed
by
the
emperors
and
brought
no
material
accession
of
territory
until
innocent
with
his
usual
energy
secured
to
the
roman
church
the
south
of
tuscany
he
was
the
first
pope
who
governed
a
considerable
territory
and
became
the
real
founder
of
the
states
of

before
him
the

for
which
they
claimed
tribute
and
service
but
no

they
administered
innocent
obtained
the
submission
of
benevento
and
romagna
he
left
the
towns
to
govern
themselves
by
their
own
laws
demanding
only
military
aid
in

of
need
and
a
small
tribute
which
was
not
always
exacted
viterbo

until
the
fifteenth
century
the
contest
with
frederic

stripped
the
holy
see
of
most
of
these
acquisitions
in
many
cases
its
civil
authority
was
no
longer
acknowledged
in
many
it
became
a
mere
title
of
honour
while
the
real
power
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
towns
or
of
the
nobles
sometimes
into
those
of
the
bishops
rudolph
of
habsburg
restored
all
that
had
been
lost
and
surrendered
the
imperial
claims
but
while
the
german
influence
was
suspended
the
influence
of
france
prevailed
over
the
papacy
and
during
the
exile
at
avignon
the
popes
were
as
helpless
as
if
they
had
possessed
not
an
acre
of
their
own
in
italy
it
was
during
their
absence
that
the
italian
republics
fell
under
the
tyrannies
and
their
dominions
were
divided
among
a
swarm
of
petty
princes
the
famous
expedition
of
cardinal
albornoz
put
an
end
to
these
disorders
he
recovered
the
territories
of
the
church
and
became
by
the
ægidian
constitutions
which
survived
for
ages
the
legislator
of
romagna
in
eighty
towns
rose
up
in
the
space
of
three
days
declared
themselves
free
or
recalled
the
princes
whom
albornoz
had
expelled
before
they
could
be
reduced
the
schism
broke
out
and
the
church
learnt
the
consequences
of
the
decline
of
the
empire
and
the
disappearance
of
its
advocacy
and
protectorate
over
the
holy

of
the
rights
which
they
had
seized
the
first
great
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
temporal
power
after
the
schism
is
the
election
of
eugenius
iv
he
swore
to
observe
a
statute
which
had
been
drawn
up
in
conclave
by
which
all
vassals
and
officers
of
state
were
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
college
of
cardinals
in
conjunction
with
the
pope
as
he
also
undertook
to
abandon
to
the
cardinals
half
the
revenue
he
shared
in
fact
his
authority
with
them
this
was
a
new
form
of
government
and
a
great
restriction
of
the
papal
power
but
it
did
not
long
endure
the
centrifugal
tendency
which
broke
up
italy
into
small
principalities
had
long
prevailed
when
at
last
the
popes
gave
way
to
it
the
first
was
sixtus
who
made
one
of
his
nephews
lord
of
imola
and
another
of
sinigaglia
alexander
vi
subdued
all
the
princes
in
the
states
of
the
church
except
the
duke
of
montefeltro
and
intended
to
make
the
whole
an
hereditary
monarchy
for
his
son
but
julius
ii
recovered
all
these
conquests
for
the
church
added
new
ones
to
them
and
thus
became
after
innocent
iii
and
albornoz
the
third
founder
of
the
roman
state
the
age
which
beheld
this
restoration
was
marked
in
almost
every
country
by
the
establishment
of
political
unity
on
the
ruins
of
the
mediæval
independence
and
of
monarchical
absolutism
at
the
expense
of
mediæval
freedom
both
of
these
tendencies
asserted
themselves
in
the
states
of
the
church
the
liberties
of
the
towns
were
gradually
destroyed
this
was
accomplished
by
clement
vii
in
ancona
in
by
paul
iii
in
perugia
in
ravenna
faenza
jesi
had
under
various
pretexts
undergone
the
same
fate
by
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
all
resistance
was
subdued
in
opposition
however
to
this
centralising
policy
the
nepotism
introduced
by
sixtus
iv
led
to
dismemberment
paul
iii
gave
parma
and
piacenza
to
his
son
pier
luigi
farnese
and
the
duchy
was
lost
to
the
holy
see
for
good
paul
iv
made
a
similar
attempt
in
favour
of
his
nephew
caraffa
but
he
was
put
to
death
under
pius
iv
and
this
species
of
nepotism
which
subsisted
at
the
expense
of
the
papal
territory
came
to
an
end
pius
forbade
under
pain
of
excommunication
to
invest
any
one
with
a
possession
of
the
holy
see
and
this
law
was
extended
even
to
temporary
concessions
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
time
came
when
the
temporal
power
was
a
source
of
weakness
and
a
weapon
by
which
the
courts
compelled
the
pope
to
consent
to
measures
he
would
otherwise
never
have
approved
it
was
thus
that
the
suppression
of
the
jesuits
was
obtained
from
clement
xiv
under
his
successors
the
world
had
an
opportunity
of
comparing
the
times
when
popes
like
alexander
iii
or
innocent
iv
governed
the
church
from
their
exile
and
now
when
men
of
the
greatest
piety
and
conscientiousness
virtually
postponed
their
duty
as
head
of
the
church
to
their
rights
as
temporal
sovereigns
and
like
the
senators
of
old
awaited
the
gauls
upon
their
throne
there
is
a
lesson
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
contrast
between
the
policy
and
the
fate
of
the
great
mediæval
pontiffs
who
preserved
their
liberty
by
abandoning
their
dominions
and
that
of
pius
vi
and
pius
who
preferred
captivity
to
flight
the
nepotism
of
urban
viii
brought
on
the
war
of
castro
and
in
its
train
increase
of
debt
of
taxes
impoverishment
of
the
state
and
the
odious
union
of
spiritual
with
temporal
arms
which
became
a
permanent
calamity
for
the
holy
see
this
attachment
to
the
interest
of
their
families
threw
great
discredit
on
the
popes
who
were
dishonoured
by
the
faults
the
crimes
and
the
punishment
of
their
relatives
but
since
the
death
of
alexander
in
even
that
later
form
of
nepotism
which
aimed
at
wealth
only
not
at
political
power
came
to
an
end
and
has
never
reappeared
except
in
the
case
of
the
braschi
the
nepotism
of
the
cardinals
and
prelates
has
survived
that
of
the
popes
if
the
statute
of
eugenius
iv
had
remained
in
force
the
college
of
cardinals
would
have
formed
a
wholesome
restraint
in
the
temporal
government
and
the
favouritism
of
the
papal
relations
would
have
been
prevented
but
the
popes
acted
with
the
absolute
power
which
was
in
the
spirit
of
the
monarchies
of
that
age
when
paul
iv
announced
to
the
sacred
college
that
he
had
stripped
the
house
of
colonna
of
its
possessions
to
enrich
his
nephew
and
that
he
was
at
war
with
spain
they
listened
in
silence
and
have
been
passive
ever
since
no
european
sovereignty
enjoyed
so
arbitrary
an
authority
under
julius
ii
the
towns
retained
considerable
privileges
and
looked
on
their
annexation
to
the
papal
state
as
a
deliverance
from
their
former
oppressors
machiavelli
and
guicciardini
say
that
the
popes
required
neither
to
defend
nor
to
administer
their
dominions
and
that
the
people
were
content
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
autonomy
in
the
course
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
administration
was
gradually
centralised
in
rome
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
ecclesiastics
before
the
governors
were
ordinarily
laymen
but
the
towns
themselves
preferred
to
be
governed
by
prelates
by
the
close
of
the
century
the
independence
of
the
corporations
had
disappeared
but
the
centralisation
though
complete
was
not
vigorous
and
practically
the
towns
and
the
barons
though
not
free
were
not
oppressed
the
modern
system
of
government
in
the
roman
states
originated
with
sixtus
he
introduced
stability
and
regularity
in
the
administration
and
checked
the
growth
of
nepotism
favouritism
and
arbitrary
power
by
the
creation
of
permanent
congregations
in
connection
with
this
measure
the
prelates
became
the
upper
class
of
official
persons
in
the
state
and
were
always
expected
to
be
men
of
fortune
a
great
burden
for
the
country
was
the
increase
of
offices
which
were
created
only
to
be
sold
no
important
duties
and
no
fixed
salary
were
attached
to
them
and
the
incumbent
had
to
rely
on
fees
and
extortion
in
the
year
there
were
places
of
this
kind
in
eighty
years
they
had
increased
to
the
theory
was
that
the
money
raised
by
the
sale
of
places
saved
the
people
from
the
imposition
of
new
taxes
innocent
in
put
an
end
to
this
traffic
but
it
had
continued
so
long
that
the
survived
there
was
a
great
contrast
between
the
ecclesiastical
administration
which
exhibited
a
dignified
stability
resting
on
fixed
rules
and
ancient
traditions
and
the
civil
government
which
was
exposed
to
continual
fluctuation
by
the
change
of
persons
of
measures
and
of
systems
for
few
popes
continued
the
plans
of
their
predecessors
the
new
pontiff
commenced
his
reign
generally
with
a
profound
sense
of
the
abuses
and
of
the
discontent
which
prevailed
before
his
elevation
and
naturally
sought
to
obtain
favour
and
improvement
by
opposite
measures
in
the
cultivation
of
the
roman
campagna
for
instance
it
was
observed
that
each
pope
followed
a
different
system
so
that
little
was
accomplished
the
persons
were
almost
always
changed
by
the
new
pope
so
that
great
offices
rarely
remained
long
in
the
same
hands
the
popes
themselves
were
seldom
versed
in
affairs
of
state
and
therefore
required
the
assistance
of
statesmen
of
long
experience
in
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
when
the
election
was
free
from
outward
influence
men
were
generally
chosen
who
had
held
under
one
or
two
popes
the
highest
office
of
state

iv
but
in
modern
times
it
has
been
the
rule
that
the
secretary
of
state
should
not
be
elected
and
that
the
new
pope
should
dismiss
the
heads
of
the
administration
clement
ix
was
the
first
who
gave
up
this
practice
and
retained
almost
all
those
who
had
been
employed
under
his
predecessor
the
burdens
of
the
state
increased
far
beyond
its
resources
from
the
aid
which
the
popes
gave
to
the
catholic
powers
especially
in
the
turkish
wars
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
debt
amounted
to
and
the
interest
absorbed
of
the
whole
income
in
it
had
risen
to
the
financial
administration
was
secret
free
from
the
control
of
public
accounts
and
the
being
necessarily
a
cardinal
was
irresponsible
there
was
no
industry
in
the
towns
they
remained
for
the
most
part
small
and
poor
almost
all
articles
of
common
use
were
imported
and
the
country
had
little
to
give
in
exchange
all
the
interest
of
the
public
debt
went
to
foreign
creditors
as
early
as
the
discontent
was
very
great
and
so
many
emigrated
in
order
to
escape
the
heavy
burdens
that
cardinal
sacchetti
said
in
that
the
population
was
reduced
by
in
the
year
the
president
de
brosses
found
the
roman
government
the
most
defective
but
the
mildest
in
europe
becattini
in
his
panegyrical
biography
of
pius
declares
that
it
was
the
worst
after
that
of
turkey
there
were
none
of
those
limitations
which
in
other
countries
restrained
the
power
of
the
monarch
no
fundamental
laws
no
coronation
oath
no
binding
decrees
of
predecessors
no
provincial
estates
no
powerful
corporations
but
in
reality
this
unlimited
absolutism
was
softened
by
custom
and
by
great
indulgence
towards
individuals
when
consalvi
adopted
the
french
institutions
he
did
not
understand
that
an
absolute
government
is
intolerable
and
must
sink
under
the
weight
of
its
responsibility
unless
it
recognises
the
restraint
of
custom
and
tradition
and
of
subordinate
but
not
dependent
forces
the
unity
and
uniformity
he
introduced
were
destructive
he
restored
none
of
the
liberties
of
the
towns
and
confided
the
administration
to
ecclesiastics
superficially
acquainted
with
law
and
without
knowledge
of
politics
or
of
public
economy
in
the
ecclesiastical
states
of
germany
the
civil
and
religious
departments
were
separate
and
it
is
as
wrong
to
say
that
the
double
position
of
the
head
must
repeat
itself
throughout
the
administration
as
to
say
that
a
king
because
he
is
the
head
of
the
army
as
well
as
of
the
civil
government
ought
to
mix
the
two
spheres
throughout
the
state
it
would
in
reality
be
perfectly
possible
to
separate
the
political
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
leo
xii
attempted
to
satisfy
the
the
adversaries
of
consalvi
by
restoring
the
old
system
he
abolished
the
provincial
councils
revived
the
inquisition
and
subjected
official
honesty
and
public
morality
to
a
strict
espionage
leo
saw
the
error
of
consalvi
but
mistook
the
remedy
and
his
government
was
the
most
unpopular
that
had
been
seen
for
a
century
where
the
laity
are
excluded
from
the
higher
offices
and
the
clergy
enjoy
the
monopoly
of
them
that
moral
power
which
modern
bureaucracy
derives
from
the
corporate
spirit
and
the
feelings
of
honour
which
it
inspires
can
not
subsist
one
class
becomes
demoralised
by
its
privileged
position
the
other
by
its
limited
prospects
and
insufficient
pay
leo
tried
to
control
them
by
the
di
which
received
and
examined
all
charges
against
official
persons
but
it
was
suppressed
by
his
successor
the
famous
memorandum
of
the
powers
may
recommended
the
admission
of
the
laity
to
all
secular
offices
the
restoration
of
the
provincial
councils
and
the
introduction
of
elective
communal
councils
with
the
power
of
local
government
and
finally
a
security
against
the
changes
incident
to
an
elective
sovereignty
the
historian
coppi
who
was
charged
to
draw
up
a
plan
of
reform
in
reply
to
these
demands
relates
that
the
pope
and
the
majority
of
the
cardinals
rejected
every
serious
change
and
were
resolved
to
uphold
the
old
principles
and
to
concede
nothing
to
the
lay
party
because
if
anything
was
voluntarily
conceded
there
would
be
no
right
of
recalling
it
afterwards
two
things
in
particular
it
was
determined
not
to
grant
elective
councils
in
the
towns
and
provinces
and
a
lay
council
of
state
beside
the
sacred
college
in
a
general
way
vague
reforms
were
promised
but
the
promise
was
not
redeemed
austria
would
not
tolerate
any
liberal
concessions
in
italy
which
were
in
contradiction
with
her
own
system
and
her
own
interests
thus
all
italian
aspirations
for
reforms
were
concentrated
in
the
wish
to
get
rid
of
the
foreign
yoke
and
austria
never
succeeded
in
forming
a
party
amongst
the
italians
favourable
to
her
power
yet
gregory
xvi
knew
that
great
changes
were
needed
in
he
said
the
civil
administration
requires
a
great
reform
i
was
too
old
when
i
was
elected
i
did
not
expect
to
live
so
long
and
had
not
the
courage
to
begin
the
undertaking
for
whoever
begins
must
accomplish
it
i
have
now
only
a
few
more
years
to
live
perhaps
only
a
few
days
after
me
they
will
choose
a
young
pope
whose
mission
it
will
be
to
perform
the
act
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
go
on
the
austrian
occupation
caused
the
roman
government
to
be
identified
with
the
foreign
supremacy
and
transferred
to
it
the
hatred
of
the
patriots
the
disaffection
of
the
subjects
of
the
pope
had
deeper
motives
except
the
clergy
that
overshadows
all
there
are
no
distinct
orders
in
the
society
of
the
roman
state
no
country
nobility
no
wealthy
class
of
peasant
proprietors
nothing
but
the
population
of
the
towns
and
a
degenerate
class
of
patricians
these
were
generally
hostile
to
the
ecclesiastical
system
the
offices
are
so
distributed
that
the
clergy
govern
and
the
laity
are
their
instruments
in
the
principal
departments
no
amount
of
services
or
ability
could
raise
a
layman
above
a
certain
level
beyond
which
younger
and
less
competent
ecclesiastics
were
promoted
over
his
head
this
subordination
which
led
to
a
regular
dependence
of
the
lay
officials
on
the
prelates
drove
the
best
men
away
from
the
service
of
the
state
and
disposed
the
rest
to
long
for
a
government
which
should
throw
open
to
them
the
higher
prizes
of
their
career
even
the
country
people
who
were
never
tainted
with
the
ideas
of
the
secret
societies
were
not
always
well
affected
it
is
more
difficult
for
a
priest
than
for
a
layman
to
put
aside
his
private
views
and
feelings
in
the
administration
of
justice
he
is
the
servant
and
herald
of
grace
of
forgiveness
of
indulgence
and
easily
forgets
that
in
human
concerns
the
law
is
inexorable
that
favour
to
one
is
often
injury
to
many
or
to
all
and
that
he
has
no
right
to
place
his
own
will
above
the
law
he
is
still
more
disqualified
for
the
direction
of
the
police
which
in
an
absolute
state
and
in
troubled
times
uses
its
unlimited
power
without
reference
to
christian
ideas
leaves
unpunished
acts
which
are
grievous
sins
and
punishes
others
which
in
a
religious
point
of
view
are
innocent
it
is
hard
for
the
people
to
distinguish
clearly
the
priestly
character
from
the
action
of
its
bearer
in
the
administration
of
police
the
same
indifference
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
the
same
confusion
between
breaches
of
divine
and
of
human
ordinances
led
to
a
practice
of
arbitrary
imprisonment
which
contrasts
painfully
with
the
natural
gentleness
of
a
priestly
government
hundreds
of
persons
were
cast
into
prison
without
a
trial
or
even
an
examination
only
on
suspicion
and
kept
there
more
than
a
year
for
greater
security
the
immunities
of
the
clergy
were
as
unpopular
as
their
power
the
laws
and
decrees
of
the
pope
as
a
temporal
sovereign
were
not
held
to
be
binding
on
them
unless
it
was
expressly
said
or
was
clear
from
the
context
that
they
were
given
also
in
his
character
of
head
of
the
church
ecclesiastics
were
tried
before
their
own
tribunals
and
had
the
right
to
be
more
lightly
punished
than
laymen
for
the
same
delinquency
those
events
in
the
life
of
achilli
which
came
out
at
his
trial
had
not
only
brought
down
on
him
no
severe
punishment
but
did
not
stand
in
the
way
of
his
promotion
with
all
these
privileges
the
bulk
of
the
roman
clergy
had
little
to
do
little
was
expected
of
them
and
their
instruction
was
extremely
deficient
at
the
end
of
the
pontificate
of
gregory
xvi
the
demand
for
reforms
was
loud
and
universal
and
men
began
to
perceive
that
the
defects
of
the
civil
government
were
undermining
the
religious
attachment
of
the
people
the
conclave
which
raised
pius
ix
to
the
papal
throne
was
the
shortest
that
had
occurred
for
near
three
hundred
years
the
necessity
of
choosing
a
pontiff
disposed
to
understand
and
to
satisfy
the
pressing
requirements
of
the
time
made
it
important
to
hasten
matters
in
order
to
escape
the
interference
of
austria
it
was
expected
that
cardinal
gizzi
or
cardinal
mastai
would
be
elected
the
latter
had
been
pointed
out
by
gregory
xvi
as
his
fittest
successor
and
he
made
gizzi
secretary
of
state
the
first
measure
of
the
new
reign
the
amnesty
which
as
metternich
said
threw
open
the
doors
of
the
house
to
the
professional
robbers
was
taken
not
so
much
as
an
act
of
policy
as
because
the
pope
was
resolved
to
undo
an
accumulation
of
injustice
the
reforms
which
followed
soon
made
pius
the
most
popular
of
italian
princes
and
all
catholics
rejoiced
that
the
reconciliation
of
the
papacy
with
modern
freedom
was
at
length
accomplished
and
that
the
shadow
which
had
fallen
on
the
priesthood
throughout
the
world
was
removed
with
the
abuses
in
the
roman
government
the
constitution
was
perhaps
an
inevitable
though
a
fatal
necessity
the
holy
father
must
fall
said
his
minister
but
at
least
he
will
fall
with
honour
the
preliminary
conditions
of
constitutional
life
were
wanting
habits
of
in
the
towns
and
provinces
security
from
the
vexations
of
the
police
separation
of
spiritual
and
temporal
jurisdiction
it
could
not
be
but
that
the
existence
of
an
elective
chamber
must
give
to
the
lay
element
a
preponderance
in
the
state
whilst
in
the
administration
the
contrary
position
was
maintained
there
could
be
no
peaceful
solution
of
this
contradiction
and
it
is
strange
that
the
cardinals
who
were
unanimously
in
favour
of
the
statute
should
not
have
seen
that
it
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
privileges
of
the
clergy
but
in
the
allocution
of
april
the
pope
declared
that
he
had
never
intended
to
alter
the
character
of
his
government
so
that
he
must
have
thought
the
old
system
of
administration
by
ecclesiastics
compatible
with
the
working
of
the
new
constitution
at
his
return
from
exile
all
his
advisers
were
in
favour
of
abrogating
all
the
concessions
of
the
first
years
of
his
reign
balbo
and
rosmini
visited
him
at
gaeta
to
plead
for
the
constitution
but
they
obtained
nothing
pius
ix
was
persuaded
that
every
concession
would
be
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
radicals
a
lay
gave
to
the
laity
a
share
of
the
supreme
government
but
the
chief
offices
and
the
last
decision
remained
as
before
in
the
hands
of
the
prelates
municipal
reforms
were
promised
in
general
the
old
defects
continued
and
the
old
discontent
was
not
conciliated
it
is
manifest
that
constitutionalism
as
it
is
ordinarily
understood
is
not
a
system
which
can
be
applied
to
the
states
of
the
church
it
could
not
be
tolerated
that
a
warlike
faction
by
refusing
supplies
should
compel
the
pope
to
go
to
war
with
a
christian
nation
as
they
sought
to
compel
him
to
declare
war
against
austria
in
his
sovereignty
must
be
real
not
merely
nominal
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
in
the
power
of
a
foreign
state
or
of
a
parliamentary
majority
but
real
sovereignty
is
compatible
with
a
participation
of
the
people
in
legislation
the
autonomy
of
corporations
a
moderate
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
separation
of
religion
and
police
recent
events
would
induce
one
to
suppose
that
the
enormous
power
of
the
press
and
of
public
opinion
which
it
forms
and
reflects
is
not
understood
in
rome
in
the
inquisitor
at
ancona
issued
an
edict
threatening
with
the
heaviest
censures
all
who
should
omit
to
denounce
the
religious
or
ecclesiastical
faults
of
their
neighbours
relatives
or
superiors
and
in
defiance
of
the
general
indignation
and
of
the
despondency
of
those
who
for
the
sake
of
religion
desired
reforms
in
the
states
of
the
church
the
declared
that
the
inquisitor
had
done
his
duty
such
cases
as
this
and
those
of
achilli
and
mortara
weighed
more
heavily
in
the
scale
in
which
the
roman
state
is
weighed
than
a
lost
battle
without
discussing
the
cases
themselves
it
is
clear
what
their
influence
has
been
on
public
opinion
with
which
it
is
more
important
at
the
present
day
to
treat
than
with
the
governments
which
depend
on
it
this
branch
of
diplomacy
has
been
unfortunately
neglected
and
hence
the
roman
government
can
not
rely
on
lay
support
after
describing
the
evils
and
disorders
of
the
state
which
the
pope
so
deeply
felt
that
he
put
his
own
existence
in
peril
and
inflamed
half
of
europe
with
the
spirit
of
radical
change
in
the
attempt
to
remove
them
döllinger
contrasts
with
the
gloomy
picture
of
decay
and
failure
the
character
of
the
pontiff
who
attempted
the
great
work
of
reform
nevertheless
the
administration
of
pius
ix
is
wise
benevolent
indulgent
thrifty
attentive
to
useful
institutions
and
improvements
all
that
proceeds
from
pius
ix
personally
is
worthy
of
a
head
of
the
church
elevated
liberal
in
the
best
sense
of
the
term
no
sovereign
spends
less
on
his
court
and
his
own
private
wants
if
all
thought
and
acted
as
he
does
his
would
be
a
model
state
both
the
french
and
the
english
envoys
affirm
that
the
financial
administration
had
improved
that
the
value
of
the
land
was
increasing
agriculture
flourishing
and
that
many
symptoms
of
progress
might
be
observed
whatever
can
be
expected
of
a
monarch
full
of
affection
for
his
people
and
seeking
his
sole
recreation
in
works
of
beneficence
pius
richly
performs
words
used
of
one
far
greater
are
simply
the
truth
applied
to
him
in
him
we
can
clearly
perceive
how
the
papacy
even
as
a
temporal
state
might
so
far
as
the
character
of
the
prince
is
concerned
through
judicious
elections
be
the
most
admirable
of
human
institutions
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
after
an
irreproachable
youth
and
a
conscientious
discharge
of
episcopal
duties
is
elevated
to
the
highest
dignity
and
to
sovereign
power
he
knows
nothing
of
expensive
amusements
he
has
no
other
passion
but
that
of
doing
good
no
other
ambition
but
to
be
beloved
by
his
subjects
his
day
is
divided
between
prayer
and
the
labours
of
government
his
relaxation
is
a
walk
in
the
garden
a
visit
to
a
church
a
prison
or
a
charitable
institution
free
from
personal
desires
and
from
terrestrial
bonds
he
has
no
relatives
no
favourites
to
provide
for
for
him
the
rights
and
powers
of
his
office
exist
only
for
the
sake
of
its
duties
grievously
outraged
injured
rewarded
with
ingratitude
he
has
never
harboured
a
thought
of
revenge
never
committed
an
act
of
severity
but
ever
forgiven
and
ever
pardoned
the
cup
of
sweetness
and
of
bitterness
the
cup
of
human
favour
and
of
human
aversion
he
has
not
only
tasted
but
emptied
to
the
dregs
he
heard
them
cry
hosannah
and
soon
after
crucifige
the
man
of
his
confidence
the
first
intellectual
power
of
his
nation
fell
beneath
the
murderer
knife
the
bullet
of
an
insurgent
struck
down
the
friend
by
his
side
and
yet
no
feeling
of
hatred
no
breath
of
anger
could
ever
obscure
even
for
a
moment
the
spotless
mirror
of
his
soul
untouched
by
human
folly
unmoved
by
human
malice
he
proceeds
with
a
firm
and
regular
step
on
his
way
like
the
stars
of
heaven
such
i
have
seen
the
action
of
this
pope
in
rome
such
it
has
been
described
to
me
by
all
whether
near
him
or
afar
and
if
he
now
seems
to
be
appointed
to
pass
through
all
the
painful
and
discouraging
experience
which
can
befall
a
monarch
and
to
continue
to
the
end
the
course
of
a
prolonged
martyrdom
he
resembles
in
this
as
in
so
many
other
things
the
sixteenth
louis
or
rather
to
go
up
higher
he
knows
that
the
disciple
is
not
above
the
master
and
that
the
pastor
of
a
church
whose
lord
and
founder
died
upon
the
cross
can
not
wonder
and
can
not
refuse
that
the
cross
should
be
laid
also
upon
him
pp
it
is
a
common
opinion
that
the
pope
as
a
sovereign
is
bound
by
the
common
law
to
the
forms
and
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
and
that
in
consequence
of
the
progress
of
society
of
the
difference
between
the
thirteenth
century
and
the
nineteenth
there
is
an
irreconcilable
discord
between
the
papacy
and
the
necessities
of
civil
government
all
catholics
are
bound
to
oppose
this
opinion
only
that
which
is
of
divine
institution
is
unchangeable
through
all
time
but
the
sovereignty
of
the
popes
is
extremely
elastic
and
has
already
gone
through
many
forms
no
contrast
can
be
stronger
than
that
between
the
use
which
the
popes
made
of
their
power
in
the
thirteenth
or
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
system
of
consalvi
there
is
no
reason
therefore
to
doubt
that
it
will
now
after
a
violent
interruption
assume
the
form
best
adapted
to
the
character
of
the
age
and
the
requirements
of
the
italian
people
there
is
nothing
chimerical
in
the
vision
of
a
new
order
of
things
in
which
the
election
shall
fall
on
men
in
the
prime
of
their
years
and
their
strength
in
which
the
people
shall
be
reconciled
to
their
government
by
free
institutions
and
a
share
in
the
conduct
of
their
own
concerns
and
the
upper
classes
satisfied
by
the
opening
of
a
suitable
career
in
public
affairs
justice
publicly
and
speedily
administered
would
obtain
the
confidence
of
the
people
the
public
service
would
be
sustained
by
an
honourable
de
the
chasm
between
laity
and
priesthood
would
be
closed
by
equality
in
rights
and
duties
the
police
would
not
rely
on
the
help
of
religion
and
religion
would
no
longer
drag
itself
along
on
the
crutches
of
the
police
the
integrity
of
the
papal
states
would
be
under
the
joint
guardianship
of
the
powers
who
have
guaranteed
even
the
dominions
of
the
sultan
and
the
pope
would
have
no
enemies
to
fear
and
his
subjects
would
be
delivered
from
the
burden
of
military
service
and
of
a
military
budget
religious
liberty
is
not
as
the
enemies
of
the
holy
see
declare
and
some
even
of
its
friends
believe
an
insurmountable
difficulty
events
often
cut
the
knots
which
appear
insoluble
to
theory
attempts
at
proselytising
have
not
hitherto
succeeded
among
the
subjects
of
the
pope
but
if
it
had
been
otherwise
would
it
have
been
possible
for
the
inquisition
to
proceed
against
a
protestant
the
agitation
that
must
have
ensued
would
be
a
welcome
opportunity
to
put
an
end
to
what
remains
of
the
temporal
power
it
is
true
that
the
advance
of
protestantism
in
italy
would
raise
up
a
barrier
between
the
pope
and
his
subjects
but
no
such
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
at
the
time
when
the
doctrines
of
the
reformation
exercised
an
almost
magical
power
over
mankind
they
never
took
root
in
italy
beyond
a
few
men
of
letters
and
now
that
their
power
of
attraction
and
expansion
has
long
been
exhausted
neither
sardinian
policy
nor
english
gold
will
succeed
in
seducing
the
italians
to
them
the
present
position
of
helpless
and
humiliating
dependence
will
not
long
endure
the
determination
of
the
piedmontese
government
to
annex
rome
is
not
more
certain
than
the
determination
of
the
emperor
napoleon
to
abrogate
the
temporal
power
pius
ix
would
enjoy
greater
security
in
turkey
than
in
the
hands
of
a
state
which
combines
the
tyranny
of
the
convention
the
impudent
sophistry
of
a
government
of
advocates
and
the
ruthless
brutality
of
military
despotism
rather
than
trust
to
piedmont
may
pius
ix
remember
the
example
of
his
greatest
predecessors
who
relying
on
the
spiritual
might
of
the
papacy
sought
beyond
the
alps
the
freedom
which
italy
denied
to
them
the
papacy
has
beheld
the
rise
and
the
destruction
of
many
thrones
and
will
assuredly
outlive
the
kingdom
of
italy
and
other
monarchies
besides
it
can
afford
to
wait
quia
the
romans
need
the
pope
more
than
the
pope
needs
rome
above
the
catacombs
among
the
basilicas
beside
the
vatican
there
is
no
place
for
a
tribune
or
for
a
king
we
shall
see
what
was
seen
in
the
fourteenth
century
envoys
will
come
from
rome
to
entreat
the
pope
to
return
to
his
faithful
city
whilst
things
continue
as
they
are
the
emperor
can
by
threatening
to
withdraw
his
troops
compel
the
pope
to
consent
to
anything
not
actually
sinful
such
a
situation
is
alarming
in
the
highest
degree
for
other
countries
but
for
the
absolute
confidence
that
all
men
have
in
the
fidelity
and
conscientiousness
of
the
present
pope
and
for
the
providential
circumstance
that
there
is
no
ecclesiastical
complication
which
the
french
government
could
use
for
its
own
ends
it
would
not
be
tolerated
by
the
rest
of
the
catholic
world
sooner
or
later
these
conditions
of
security
will
disappear
and
the
interest
of
the
church
demands
that
before
that
happens
the
peril
should
be
averted
even
by
a
catastrophe
the
hostility
of
the
italians
themselves
to
the
holy
see
is
the
tragic
symptom
of
the
present
malady
in
other
ages
when
it
was
assailed
the
italians
were
on
its
side
or
at
least
were
neutral
now
they
require
the
destruction
of
the
temporal
power
either
as
a
necessary
sacrifice
for
the
unity
and
greatness
of
their
country
or
as
a
just
consequence
of
incurable
defects
the
time
will
come
however
when
they
will
be
reconciled
with
the
papacy
and
with
its
presence
as
a
power
among
them
it
was
the
dependence
of
the
pope
on
the
austrian
arms
and
his
identification
in
popular
opinion
with
the
cause
of
the
detested
foreigner
that
obscured
his
lofty
position
as
the
moral
bulwark
and
protector
of
the
nation
for
years
the
holy
see
was
the
pivot
of
italian
history
and
the
source
of
the
italian
influence
in
europe
the
nation
and
the
see
shared
the
same
fortunes
and
grew
powerful
or
feeble
together
it
was
not
until
the
vices
of
alexander
vi
and
his
predecessors
had
destroyed
the
reverence
which
was
the
protection
of
italy
that
she
became
the
prey
of
the
invaders
none
of
the
great
italian
historians
has
failed
to
see
that
they
would
ruin
themselves
in
raising
their
hands
against
rome
the
old
prophecy
of
the
of
an
angel
pope
who
was
to
rise
up
to
put
an
end
to
discord
and
disorder
and
to
restore
piety
and
peace
and
happiness
in
italy
was
but
the
significant
token
of
the
popular
belief
that
the
papacy
and
the
nation
were
bound
up
together
and
that
one
was
the
guardian
of
the
other
that
belief
slumbers
now
that
the
idea
of
unity
prevails
whilst
the
italians
are
attempting
to
put
the
roof
on
a
building
without
walls
and
without
foundations
but
it
will
revive
again
when
centralisation
is
compelled
to
yield
to
federalism
and
the
road
to
the
practicable
has
been
found
in
the
search
after
impossibilities
the
tyrannical
character
of
the
piedmontese
government
its
contempt
for
the
sanctity
of
public
law
the
principles
on
which
it
treats
the
clergy
at
home
and
the
manner
in
which
it
has
trampled
on
the
rights
of
the
pope
and
the
interests
of
religion
the
perfidy
and
despotism
it
exhibits
render
it
impossible
that
any
securities
it
may
offer
to
the
pope
can
possess
a
real
value
moreover
in
the
unsettled
state
of
the
kingdom
the
uncertain
succession
of
parties
and
the
fluctuation
of
power
whatever
guarantee
is
proposed
by
the
ministry
there
is
nobody
to
guarantee
the
guarantor
it
is
a
system
without
liberty
and
without
stability
and
the
pope
can
never
be
reconciled
to
it
or
become
a
dweller
in
the
new
italian
kingdom
if
he
must
choose
between
the
position
of
a
subject
and
of
an
exile
he
is
at
home
in
the
whole
catholic
world
and
wherever
he
goes
he
will
be
surrounded
by
children
who
will
greet
him
as
their
father
it
may
become
an
inevitable
but
it
must
always
be
a
heroic
resolution
the
court
and
the
various
congregations
for
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
the
church
are
too
numerous
to
be
easily
moved
in
former
times
the
machinery
was
more
simple
and
the
whole
body
of
the
pontifical
government
could
be
lodged
in
a
single
french
monastery
the
absence
of
the
pope
from
rome
will
involve
great
difficulties
and
annoyance
but
it
is
a
lesser
evil
than
a
surrender
of
principle
which
can
not
be
recalled
to
remove
the
holy
see
to
france
would
under
present
circumstances
be
an
open
challenge
to
a
schism
and
would
afford
to
all
who
wish
to
curtail
the
papal
rights
or
to
interrupt
the
communication
between
the
pope
and
the
several
churches
the
most
welcome
pretexts
and
it
would
put
arms
in
the
hands
of
governments
that
wish
to
impede
the
action
of
his
authority
within
their
states
the
conclusion
of
the
book
is
as
follows
if
the
court
of
rome
should
reside
for
a
time
in
germany
the
roman
prelates
will
doubtless
be
agreeably
surprised
to
discover
that
our
people
is
able
to
remain
catholic
and
religious
without
the
of
a
police
and
that
its
religious
sentiments
are
a
better
protection
to
the
church
than
the
episcopal
which
thank
god
do
not
exist
they
will
learn
that
the
church
in
germany
is
able
to
maintain
herself
without
the
holy
office
that
our
bishops
although
or
because
they
use
no
physical
compulsion
are
reverenced
like
princes
by
the
people
that
they
are
received
with
triumphal
arches
that
their
arrival
in
a
place
is
a
festival
for
the
inhabitants
they
will
see
how
the
church
with
us
rests
on
the
broad
strong
and
healthy
basis
of
a
system
of
pastoral
administration
and
of
popular
religious
instruction
they
will
perceive
that
we
catholics
have
maintained
for
years
the
struggle
for
the
deliverance
of
the
church
from
the
bonds
of
bureaucracy
straightforwardly
and
without
reservation
that
we
can
not
entertain
the
idea
of
denying
to
the
italians
what
we
have
claimed
for
ourselves
and
that
therefore
we
are
far
from
thinking
that
it
is
anywhere
an
advantage
to
fortify
the
church
with
the
authority
of
the
police
and
with
the
power
of
the
secular
arm
throughout
germany
we
have
been
taught
by
experience
the
truth
of
fénelon
saying
that
the
spiritual
power
must
be
carefully
kept
separate
from
the
civil
because
their
union
is
pernicious
they
will
find
further
that
the
whole
of
the
german
clergy
is
prepared
to
bless
the
day
when
it
shall
learn
that
the
free
sovereignty
of
the
pope
is
assured
without
sentence
of
death
being
still
pronounced
by
ecclesiastics
without
priests
continuing
to
discharge
the
functions
of
or
police
directors
or
to
conduct
the
business
of
the
lottery
and
finally
they
will
convince
themselves
that
all
the
catholics
of
germany
will
stand
up
as
one
man
for
the
independence
of
the
holy
see
and
the
legitimate
rights
of
the
pope
but
that
they
are
no
admirers
of
a
form
of
government
of
very
recent
date
which
is
in
fact
nothing
else
than
the
product
of
the
mechanical
polity
of
napoleon
combined
with
a
clerical
administration
and
this
information
will
bear
good
fruit
when
the
hour
shall
strike
for
the
return
and
restitution
shall
be
made
meanwhile
pius
ix
and
the
men
of
his
council
will
think
upon
the
days
of
old
and
have
in
their
minds
the
eternal
years
they
will
read
the
future
in
the
earlier
history
of
the
papacy
which
has
already
seen
many
an
exile
and
many
a
restoration
the
example
of
the
resolute
courageous
popes
of
the
middle
ages
will
light
the
way
it
is
no
question
now
of
suffering
martyrdom
of
clinging
to
the
tombs
of
the
apostles
or
of
descending
into
the
catacombs
but
of
quitting
the
land
of
bondage
in
order
to
exclaim
on
a
free
soil
our
bonds
are
broken
and
we
are
free
for
the
rest
god
will
provide
and
the
unceasing
gifts
and
sympathies
of
the
catholic
world
and
the
parties
in
italy
when
they
have
torn
and
exhausted
the
land
which
has
become
a
when
the
sobered
and
saddened
people
tired
of
the
rule
of
lawyers
and
of
soldiers
has
understood
the
worth
of
a
moral
and
spiritual
authority
then
will
be
the
time
to
think
of
returning
to
the
eternal
city
in
the
interval
the
things
will
have
disappeared
for
whose
preservation
such
pains
are
taken
and
then
there
will
be
better
reason
than
consalvi
had
in
the
preface
to
the
of
july
to
say
divine
providence
which
so
conducts
human
affairs
that
out
of
the
greatest
calamity
innumerable
benefits
proceed
seems
to
have
intended
that
the
interruption
of
the
papal
government
should
prepare
the
way
for
a
more
perfect
form
of
it
we
have
written
at
a
length
for
which
we
must
apologise
to
our
readers
and
yet
this
is
but
a
meagre
sketch
of
the
contents
of
a
book
which
deals
with
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
subjects
that
occupy
the
thoughts
and
move
the
feelings
of
religious
men
we
will
attempt
to
sum
up
in
a
few
words
the
leading
ideas
of
the
author
addressing
a
mixed
audience
he
undertakes
to
controvert
two
different
interpretations
of
the
events
which
are
being
fulfilled
in
rome
to
the
protestants
who
triumph
in
the
expected
downfall
of
the
papacy
he
shows
the
consequences
of
being
without
it
to
the
catholics
who
see
in
the
roman
question
a
great
peril
to
the
church
he
explains
how
the
possession
of
the
temporal
sovereignty
had
become
a
greater
misfortune
than
its
loss
for
a
time
would
be
from
the
opposite
aspects
of
the
religious
camps
of
our
age
he
endeavours
to
awaken
the
misgivings
of
one
party
and
to
strengthen
the
confidence
of
the
other
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
protestant
system
and
the
progress
of
modern
learning
there
is
none
between
the
authority
of
the
holy
see
and
the
progress
of
modern
society
the
events
which
are
tending
to
deprive
the
pope
of
his
territory
are
not
to
be
therefore
deplored
if
we
consider
the
preceding
causes
because
they
made
this
catastrophe
inevitable
still
less
if
looking
to
the
future
we
consider
the
state
of
protestantism
because
they
remove
an
obstacle
to
union
which
is
humanly
almost
insurmountable
in
a
former
work
döllinger
exhibited
the
moral
and
intellectual
exhaustion
of
paganism
as
the
prelude
to
christianity
in
like
manner
he
now
confronts
the
dissolution
and
spiritual
decay
of
protestantism
with
the
papacy
but
in
order
to
complete
the
contrast
and
give
force
to
the
vindication
it
was
requisite
that
the
true
function
and
character
of
the
holy
see
should
not
be
concealed
from
the
unpractised
vision
of
strangers
by
the
mask
of
that
system
of
government
which
has
grown
up
around
it
in
modern
times
the
importance
of
this
violent
disruption
of
the
two
authorities
consists
in
the
state
of
religion
throughout
the
world
its
cause
lies
in
the
deficiences
of
the
temporal
power
its
end
in
the
mission
of
the
spiritual
the
interruption
of
the
temporal
sovereignty
is
the
only
way
we
can
discern
in
which
these
deficiences
can
be
remedied
and
these
ends
obtained
but
this
interruption
can
not
be
prolonged
in
an
age
in
which
the
state
throughout
the
continent
is
absolute
and
tolerates
no
immunities
when
corporations
have
therefore
less
freedom
than
individuals
and
the
disposition
to
restrict
their
action
increases
in
proportion
to
their
power
the
pope
can
not
be
independent
as
a
subject
he
must
therefore
be
a
sovereign
the
free
ruler
of
an
actual
territory
protected
by
international
law
and
a
european
guarantee
the
restoration
consequently
is
necessary
though
not
as
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
revolution
in
this
revolutionary
age
the
protection
of
the
catholic
powers
is
required
against
outward
attack
they
must
also
be
our
security
that
no
disaffection
is
provoked
within
that
there
shall
be
no
recurrence
of
the
dilemma
between
the
right
of
insurrection
against
an
arbitrary
government
and
the
duty
of
obedience
to
the
pope
and
that
civil
society
shall
not
again
be
convulsed
nor
the
pillars
of
law
and
order
throughout
europe
shaken
by
a
revolution
against
the
church
of
which
in
the
present
instance
the
conservative
powers
share
the
blame
and
have
already
felt
the
consequences
in
the
earnest
and
impressive
language
of
the
conclusion
in
which
döllinger
conveys
the
warnings
which
all
transalpine
catholicism
owes
to
its
head
as
an
italian
sovereign
it
seems
to
us
that
something
more
definite
is
intended
than
the
expression
of
the
wish
which
almost
every
catholic
feels
to
receive
the
pope
in
his
own
country
the
anxiety
for
his
freedom
which
would
be
felt
if
he
took
refuge
in
france
would
be
almost
equally
justified
by
his
presence
in
austria
a
residence
in
an
exclusively
catholic
country
such
as
spain
would
be
contrary
to
the
whole
spirit
of
this
book
and
to
the
moral
which
it
inculcates
that
the
great
significance
of
the
crisis
is
in
the
state
of
german
protestantism
if
the
position
of
the
catholics
in
germany
would
supply
useful
lessons
and
examples
to
the
roman
court
it
is
also
from
the
vicinity
of
the
protestant
world
that
the
full
benefit
can
best
be
drawn
from
its
trials
and
that
the
crimes
of
the
italians
which
have
begun
as
calamities
may
be
turned
to
the
advantage
of
the
church
but
against
such
counsels
there
is
a
powerful
influence
at
work
napoleon
has
declared
his
determination
to
sweep
away
the
temporal
power
the
continuance
of
the
occupation
of
rome
and
his
express
prohibition
to
the
piedmontese
government
to
proceed
with
the
annexation
during
the
life
of
the
present
pope
signify
that
he
calculates
on
greater
advantages
in
a
conclave
than
from
the
patient
resolution
of
pius

this
policy
is
supported
by
the
events

the

appear
as
the
only
saviour
and
the

of
a
prolonged
exile
in
any
catholic
country
and
of
dependence
for
subsistence

the

the

the

of

on
these
hopes
and
fears
and
on
the
difficulties
which
are
pressing
on
the
cardinals
from
the
loss
of
their
revenues
the
emperor
speculates
and
persuades
himself
that
he
will
be
master
of
the
next
election
on
the
immovable
constancy
of
her
supreme
pontiff
the
catholic
church
unconditionally
relies
and
we
are
justified
in
believing
that
in
an
almost
unparalleled
emergency
he
will
not
tremble
before
a
resolution
of
which
no
pope
has
given
an
example
since
the

power

when
first
seen
at
würzburg
in
the
diaries
of
platen
the
poet
döllinger
was
an
eager
student
of
general
literature
and
especially
of
schlegel
and
the
romantic
philosophy
it
was
an
epoch
in
which
the
layman
and
the
prevailed
in
other
days
a
divine
had
half
a
dozen
distinct
schools
of
religious
thought
before
him
each
able
to
develop
and
to
satisfy
a
receptive
mind
but
the
best
traditions
of
western
scholarship
had
died
away
when
the
young
franconian
obtained

in

reorganised
university
of

to

new
professor
exempt
by
date
and
position
from
the
discipline
of
a
theological
party
he
so
continued
and
never
turned
elsewhere
for
the
dependence
he
escaped
at
home
no
german
theologian
of
his
own
or
other

bent

course
and
he
derived
nothing
from
the
powerful
writer
then
dominant
in
the
north
to
a
friend
describing
herder
as
the
one
unprofitable
classic

replied
did
you
ever

anything

and
if
it
is
doubtful
which
way
this
stroke
was
aimed
it
is
certain
that
he
saw
less

very
young
he
knew
modern

well
though
with
a
defective
ear
and
having
no

or
contemporary
attachments
he
devoted
himself
systematically
to
the
study
of
foreign
divines
the
characteristic
universality
of
his
later
years
was
not
the
mere
result
of
untiring
energy
and
an
unlimited
command
of
books
his
international
habit
sprang
from
the
inadequacy
of
the
national
supply
and
the
search
for
truth
in

century
naturally
became
a
lecturer
whose
function
it
was
to
unfold
from
first
to
last
the
entire
life
of
the
church
whose
range
extended
over
all
christian
ages
and
who
felt
the
inferiority
of

döllinger
conception
of
the
science
which
he
was
appointed
to
carry
forward
in
conformity
with
new
requirements
and
new
resources
differed
from
the
average
chiefly
by
being
more
thorough
and
comprehensive
at
two
points
he
was
touched
by
currents
of
the
day
savigny
the
legal
expert
of
a
school
recruited
from
both
denominations
and
gravitating
towards
catholicism
had
expounded
law
and
society
in
that
historic
spirit
which
soon
pervaded
other
sciences
and
restored
the
significance
of

custom
and
character
by
his
writings
protestant
literature
overlapped
the
example
of
the
conspicuous
jurist
served
as
a
suggestion
for
divines
to
realise
the
patient
process
of
history
and
döllinger
continued
to
recognise
him
as
a
master
and
originator
of
true
scientific
methods
when
his
influence
on
jurisprudence
was
on
the
wane
on
the
same
track

than

the
first

thinker
whom
he

and
heard
was
baader
the
poorest
of
writers
but
the
most
instructive
and
impressive
talker
in
germany
and
the
one
man
who
appears
to
have
influenced
the
direction
of
his
mind
bishop
martensen
has
described
his
amazing
powers
and
döllinger
who
remembered
him
with
more
scant
esteem
bore
equal
testimony
to
the
wealth
and
worth
of
his
religious
philosophy
he
probably
owed
to
him
his
persistent
disparagement
of
hegel
and
more
certainly
that
familiarity
with
the
abstruse
literature
of
mysticism
which
made
him
as
clear
and
sure
of
vision
in
the
twilight
of
petrucci
and
martin

in
the
congenial
company
of
duperron
baader
is
remembered
by
those
who
abstain
from
sixteen
volumes
of
discordant
thought
as
the
inventor
of
that
system
of
political
insurance
which
became
the
holy
alliance
that
authority
is
as
sacred
and
sovereignty
as
absolute
in
the
church
as
in
the
state
was
an
easy
and
obvious
inference
and
it
had
been
lately
drawn
with
an
energy
and
literary
point
to
which
baader
was
a
stranger
by
the
count
de
maistre
who
was
moreover
a
student
of
martin
when
the
ancient
mystic
welcomed
his
new
friend
he
was
full
of
the
praises
of
de
maistre
he
impressed
upon
his
earnest
listener
the
importance
of
the
books
on
the
pope
and
on
the
gallican
church
and
assured
him
that
the
spirit
which
animates
them
is
the
genuine
catholicism
these
conversations
were
the
origin
of
döllinger
specific
ultramontanism
it
governed
one
half
of
his
life
and
his
interest
in
de
maistre
outlasted
the
assent
which
he
once
gave
to
some
of
his
opinions
questions
arising
from
the
savoyard
indictment
against
bacon
which
he
proposed
to
liebig
formed
the
connection
between
the
two
laboured
attacks
on
the
founder
of
english
philosophy
much
of
that
which
at
any
time
was
unhistoric
or
presumptive
in
his
mind
may
be
ascribed
to
this
influence
and
it
divided
him
from
möhler
who
was
far
before
him
in
the
fulness
of
the
enjoyment
of
his

surrendered

from

differed
so
widely
that
one
of
them
hesitated
to

generally
kept
the

out

warmly
recommended

cautioned
his
pupils

forger

a
cheat

dishonestly

took
that
branch
for
the
time
but
he
never
afterwards
taught
theology
proper
as
möhler
who
was
essentially
a
theologian
deserted
divinity
to
compose
inferior
treatises
on
the
gnostics
and
the
false
decretals
döllinger
by
choice
and
vocation
a
divine
having
religion
as
the
purpose
of
his
life
judged
that
the
loftier
function
the
more
spiritual
service
was
historical
teaching
the
problem
is
to
know
how
it
came
to
pass
that
a
man
who
was
eminently
intelligent
and
perspicuous
in
the
exposition
of
doctrines
but
who
in
narrative
description
and
knowledge
of
character
was
neither
first
nor
second
resolved
that
his
mission
was
history
in
early
life
he
had
picked
up
chance
copies
of
baronius
and
petavius
the
pillars
of
historic
theology
but
the
motives
of
his
choice
lay
deeper
church
history
had
long
been
the
weakest
point
and
the
cause
of
weakness
among
the
catholics
and
it
was
the
rising
strength
of
the
german
protestants
therefore
it
was
the
post
of
danger
and
it
gave
to
a
theologian
the
command
of
a
public
of
laymen
the
restoration
of
history
coincided
with
the
euthanasia
of
metaphysic
when
the
foremost
philosophic
genius
of
the
time
led
over
to
the
historic
treatment

many

for

went
the

way
the

up
in

said
there
is
still
a
scholastic
hardness
in
our
controversial
theology
an
unbendingness
of
outward
forms
in
our
explanations
of
catholic
principles
which
renders
our
theologians
dry
and
unattractive
to
the
most
catholicly
inclined
portion
of
our
protestants
the
choice
which
these
youths
made
towards
was
though
they
did
not
know
it
the
beginning
of
a
rift
that
widened
döllinger
was
more
in
earnest
than
others
in
regarding
christianity
as
history
and
in
pressing
the
affinity
between
catholic
and
historical
thought
systems
were
to
him
nearly
as
codes
to
savigny
when
he
exhorted
his
contemporaries
not
to
consolidate
their
law
lest
with
their
wisdom
and
knowledge
they
should
incorporate
their
delusions
and
their
ignorance
and
usurp
for
the
state
what
belonged
to
the
nation
he
would
send
an
inquiring
student
to
the
congregationis
de
and
the
rather
than
to
molina
or
lemos
and
often
gave
the
advice
which
coming
from
oriel
disconcerted
morris
of
exeter
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
read
the
jesuit
petavius
he
dreaded
the
predominance
of
great
names
which
stop
the
way
and
everything
that
interposes
the
notions
of
an
epoch
a
region
or
a

between
the
church
and
the
observer
to
an
innsbruck
professor
lamenting
that
there
was
no
philosophy
which
he
could
heartily
adopt
he
replied
that
philosophies
do
not
subsist
in
order
to
be
adopted
a
thomist
or
a
cartesian
seemed
to
him
as
a
captive
or
a
combatant
prizing
metaphysicians
for
the
unstrung
pearls
which
they
drop
beyond
the
seclusion
of
system
he
loved
the
of
coleridge
and
preferred
the
and
und
to
the
constructed
work
of
gioberti
and
schopenhauer
he
knew
leibniz
chiefly
in
his
letters
and
was
perceptibly
affected
by
his
law
of
continuous
progression
his
general
optimism
and
his
eclectic
art
of
extracting
from
men
and
books
only
the
good
that
is
in
them
but
of
monadology
or
harmony
there
was
not
a
trace
his
colleague
schelling
no
friend
to
the
friends
of
baader
stood
aloof
the
elder
windischmann
whom
he
particularly
esteemed
and
who
acted
in
germany
as
the
interpreter
of
de
maistre
had
hailed
hegel
as
a
pioneer
of
sound
philosophy
with
whom
he
agreed
both
in
thought
and
word
döllinger
had
no
such
condescension
hegel
remained
in
his
the
strongest
of
all
the
enemies
of
religion
the
guide
of
tübingen
in
its
aberrations
the
reasoner
whose
abstract
dialectics
made
a
generation
of
clever
men
incapable
of
facing
facts
he
went
on
preferring
former
historians
of
dogma
who
were
untainted
by
the
trail
of
pantheism
and
even
muenscher
and
by
no
means
admitted
that
baur
was
deeper
than
the
early
jesuits
and
oratorians
or
gained
more
than
he
lost
by
constriction
in
the
hegelian
coil
he
took
pleasure
in
pointing
out
that
the
best
recent
book
on
the
penitential
system
kliefoth
fourth
volume
owed
its
substance
to
morinus
the
dogmas
of
pantheistic
history
offended
him
too
much
to
give
them
deep
study
and
he
was
ill
prepared
with
counsel
for
a
wanderer
lost
in
the
pervading
haze
hegelians
said
of
him
that
he
lacked
the
constructive
unity
of
idea
and
knew
the
way
from
effect
to
cause
but
not
from
cause
to
law
his
own
lectures
on
the
philosophy
of
religion
which
have
left
no
deep
furrow
have
been
praised
by
ketteler
who
was
not
an
undiscriminating
admirer
he
sent
on
one
of
his
pupils
to
rosmini
and
set
another
to
begin
metaphysics
with
suarez
and
when
lady
ashburton
consulted
him
on
the
subject
he
advised
her
to
read
norris
and
malebranche
he
encouraged
the
study
of
remoter
luminaries
such
as
cusa
and
raymundus
whose
he
preferred
to
the
and
would
not
have
men
overlook
some
who
are
off
the
line
like
postel
but
although
he
deemed
it
the
mark
of
inferiority
to
neglect
a
grain
of
the
gold
of
obsolete
and
eccentric
writers
he
always
assigned
to
original
speculation
a
subordinate
place
as
a
good
servant
but
a
bad
master
without
the
certainty
and
authority
of
history
what
one
of
his
english
friends
writes
of
a
divine
they
both
admired
might
fitly
be
applied
to
him
he
was
a
disciple
in
the
school
of
bishop
butler
and
had
learned
as
a
first
principle
to
recognise
the
limitations
of
human
knowledge
and
the
unphilosophical
folly
of
trying
to
round
off
into
finished
and
pretentious
schemes
our
fragmentary
yet
certain
notices
of
our
own
condition
and
of
god
dealing
with
it
he
alarmed
archer
gurney
by
saying
that
all
hope
of
an
understanding
is
at
an
end
if
logic
be
applied
for
the
rectification
of
dogma
and
to
plummer
who
acknowledged
him
as
the
most
capable
of
modern
theologians
and
historians
he
spoke
of
the
hopelessness
of
trying
to
discover
the
meaning
of
terms
used
in
definitions
to
his
archbishop
he
wrote
that
men
may
discuss
the
mysteries
of
faith
to
the
last
day
without
avail
we
stand
here
on
the
solid
ground
of
history
evidence
and
fact
expressing
his
innermost
thought
that
religion
exists
to
make
men
better
and
that
the
ethical
quality
of
dogma
constitutes
its
value
he
once
said
tantum
valet
quantum
ad
corrigendum
purgandum
sanctificandum
hominem
confert
in
theology
as
an
intellectual
exercise
beyond
its
action
on
the
soul
he
felt
less
interest
and
those
disputes
most
satisfied
him
which
can
be
decided
by
appeal
to
the
historian
from
his
early
reputation
and
his
position
at
the
outpost
confronting
protestant
science
he
was
expected
to
make
up
his
mind
over
a
large
area
of
unsettled
thought
and
disputed
fact
and
to
be
provided
with
an
opinion
a
freehold
opinion
of
his
own
and
a
reasoned
answer
to
every
difficulty
people
had
a
right
to
know
what
he
knew
about
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
chapter
of
mark
and
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
chapter
of

the
lives
of

of

the
author
of

of

the
the
suspense
and
poise
of
the
mind
which
is
the
pride
and
privilege
of
the
unprofessional
scholar
was
forbidden
him
students
could
not
wait
for
the
master
to
complete
his
studies
they
flocked
for
dry
light
of
knowledge
for
something
defined
and
final
to
their
keen
grave
unemotional
professor
who
said
sometimes
more
than
he
could
be
sure
of
but
who
was
not
likely
to
abridge
thought
by
oracular
responses
or
to
give
aphorism
for
argument
he
accepted
the
necessity
of
the
situation
a
time
came
when
everybody
was
invited
once
a
week
to
put
any
imaginable
question
from
the
whole
of
church
history
and
he
at
once
replied
if
this
was
a
stimulus
to
exertion
during
the
years
spent
in
mastering
and
pondering
the
immense
materials
it
served
less
to
promote
originality
and
care
than
premature
certitude
and
the
craving
for
quick
returns
apart
from
the
constant
duty
of
teaching
his
knowledge
might
not
have
been
so
extensive
but
his
views
would
have
been
less
decided
and
therefore
less
liable
to
change
as
an
historian
döllinger
regarded
christianity
as
a
force
more
than
as
a
doctrine
and
displayed
it
as
it
expanded
and
became
the
soul
of
later
history
it
was
the
mission
and
occupation
of
his
life
to
discover
and
to
disclose
how
this
was
accomplished
and
to
understand
the
history
of
civilised
europe
religious
and
profane
mental
and
political
by
the
aid
of
sources
which
being
original
and
authentic
yielded
certainty
in
his
vigorous
prime
he
thought
that
it
would
be
within
his
powers
to
complete
the
narrative
of
the
conquest
of
the
world
by
christ
in
a
single
massive
work
the
separated
churches
the
centrifugal
forces
were
to
have
been
treated
apart
until
he
adopted
the
ampler
title
of
a
history
of
christianity
we
who
look
back
upon
all
that
the
combined
and
divided
labour
of
a
thousand
earnest
gifted
and
often
instructed
men
has
done
and
left
undone
in
sixty
years
can
estimate
the
scientific
level
of
an
age
where
such
a
dream
could
be
dreamed
by
such
a
man
misled
neither
by
imagination
nor
ambition
but
knowing
his
own
limitations
and
the
immeasurable
world
of
books
experience
slowly
taught
him
that
he
who
takes
all
history
for
his
province
is
not
the
man
to
write
a
compendium
the
four
volumes
of
which
gave
him
a
name
in
literature
appeared
between
and
and
stopped
short
of
the
reformation
in
writing
mainly
for
the
horizon
of
seminaries
it
was
desirable
to
eschew
voyages
of
discovery
and
the
pathless
the
materials
were
all
in
print
and
were
the
daily
bread
of
scholars
a
celebrated
anglican
described
döllinger
at
that
time
as
more
intentional
than
fleury
while
catholics
objected
that
he
was
a
candid
friend
and
lutherans
probing
deeper
observed
that
he
resolutely
held
his
ground
wherever
he
could
and
as
resolutely
abandoned
every
position
that
he
found
untenable
he
has
since
said
of
himself
that
he
always
spoke
sincerely
but
that
he
spoke
as
an
advocate
a
sincere
advocate
who
pleaded
only
for
a
cause
which
he
had
convinced
himself
was
just
the
cause
he
pleaded
was
the
divine
government
of
the
church
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
that
it
would
be
preserved
from
error
though
not
from
sin
the
uninterrupted
employment
of
the
powers
committed
by
christ
for
the
salvation
of
man
by
the
absence
of
false
arts
he
acquired
that
repute
for
superior
integrity
which
caused
a
tyrolese
divine
to
speak
of
him
as
the
most
chivalrous
of
the
catholic
celebrities
and
the
nuncio
who
was
at
munich
during
the
first
ten
years
called
him
the

un

taking
his
survey
from
the
elevation
of
general
history
he
gives
less
space
to
all
the
early
heresies
together
than
to
the
rise
of
mohammedanism
his
way
lies
between
neander
who
cares
for
no
institutions
and
baur
who
cares
for
no
individuals
he
was
entirely
exempt
from
that
impersonal
idealism
which
sybel
laid
down
at
the
foundation
of
his
review
which
causes
delbrück
to
complain
that
macaulay
who
could
see
facts
so
well
could
not
see
that
they
are
revelations
which
baur
defines
without
disguise

the
two
posthumous
works
of
hegel
which
turned
events
into
theories
had
not
then
appeared
döllinger
setting
life
and

above

omitted
the
progress
of
doctrine
he
proposed
that
möhler
should
take
that
share
of
their
common
topic
and
the
plan
entertained
at
first
was
interrupted
with
much
besides
by
death
he
felt
too
deeply
the
overwhelming
unity
of
force
to
yield
to
that
atomic
theory
which
was
provoked
by
the
hegelian
excess

but
he
allows
a
vast
scope
to
the
variable
will
and
character
of
man
the
object
of
religion
upon
earth
is
saintliness
and
its
success
is
shown
in
holy
individuals
he
leaves
law
and
doctrine
moving
in
their
appointed
orbits
to
hold
up
great
men
and
examples
of
christian
virtue
döllinger
who
had
in
youth
acted
as
secretary
to
hohenlohe
was
always
reserved
in
his
use
of
the
supernatural
in
the
vision
of
constantine
and
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
he
gives
his
reader
both
the
natural
explanation
and
the
miraculous
he
thought
that
the
witness
of
the
fathers
to
the
continuance
of
miraculous
powers
could
not
be
resisted
without
making
history
but
later
on
the
more
he
sifted
and
compared
authorities
the
more
severe
he
became
he
deplored
the
uncritical
credulity
of
the
author
of
the
of
the
and
in
examining
the
stigmata
he
cited
the
experience
of
a
spanish
convent
where
they
were
so
common
that
it
became
a
sign
of
reprobation
to
be
without
them
historians
he
said
have
to
look
for
natural
causes
enough
will
remain
for
the
action
of
providence
where
we
can
not
penetrate
in
his
unfinished
book
on
he
enumerates
the
illusions
of
mediæval
saints
when
they
spoke
of
the
future
and
describes
them
as
he
once
described
carlyle
and
ruskin
as
prophets
having
nothing
to
foretell
at
frankfort
where
he
spoilt
his
watch
by
depositing
it
in
unexpected
holy
water
and
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
put
it
there
to
mend
it
everybody
knew
that
there
was
hardly
a
catholic
in
the
parliament
of
whom
such
a
fable
could
be
told
with
more
felicitous
unfitness
for
twenty
years
of
his
life
at
munich
görres
was
the
impressive
central
figure
of
a
group
reputed
far
and
wide
the
most
intellectual
force
in
the
catholic
world
seeing
things
by
the
light
of
other
days
nippold
and
maurenbrecher
describe
döllinger
himself
as
its
most
eminent
member
there
was
present
gain
and
future
peril
in
living
amongst
a
clever
but
restricted
set
sheltered
supported
and
restrained
by
friends
who
were
united
in
aims
and
studies
who
cherished
their
sympathies
and
their
enmities
in
common
and
who
therefore
believed
that
they
were
divided
by
no
deep
cleft
or
ultimate
principle
döllinger
never
outlived
the
glamour
of
the
eloquence
and
ascendancy
of
görres
and
spoke
of
him
long
after
his
death
as
a
man
of
real
knowledge
and
of
greater
religious
than
political
insight
between
the
imaginative
rhetorician
and
the
measured
scrutinising
scholar
the
contrast
was
wide
one
of
the
many
pupils
and
rare
disciples
of
the
former
complained
that
his
friend
supplied
interminable
matter
for
the
sterile
and
unavailing
in
order
to
amuse
him
with
ropes
of
sand
and
the
severest
censure
of
döllinger
art
as
an
historian
was
pronounced
by
görres
when
he
said
i
always
see
analogies
and
you
always
see
differences
at
all
times
but
in
his
early
studies
especially
he
owed
much
to
the
italians
whose
ecclesiastical
literature
was
the
first
that
he
mastered
and
predominates
in
his
church
history
several
of
his
countrymen
such
as
savigny
and
raumer
had
composed
history
on
the
shoulders
of
bolognese
and
lombard
scholars
and
some
of
their
most
conspicuous
successors
to
the
present
day
have
lived
under
heavy
obligations
to
modena
and
san
marino
during
the
tranquil
century
before
the
revolution
italians
studied
the
history
of
their
country
with
diligence
and
success
even
such
places
as
parma
verona
brescia
became
centres
of
obscure
but
faithful
work
osimo
possessed
annals
as
bulky
as
rome
the
story
of
the
province
of
treviso
was
told
in
twenty
volumes
the
antiquities
of
picenum
filled
folios
the
best
of
all
this
national
and
municipal
patriotism
was
given
to
the
service
of
religion
popes
and
cardinals
dioceses
and
parish
churches
became
the
theme
of
untiring
enthusiasts
there
too
were
the
stupendous
records
of
the
religious
orders
their
bulls
and
charters
their
biography
and
their
bibliography
in
this
immense
world
of
patient
accurate
devoted
research
döllinger
laid
the
deep
foundations
of
his
historical
knowledge
beginning
like
everybody
with
baronius
and
muratori
he
gave
a
large
portion
of
his
life
to
noris
and
to
the
solid
and
enlightened
scholarship
that
surrounded
benedict
down
to
the
compilers
borgia
fantuzzi
marini
with
whom
in
the
evil
days
of
regeneration
by
the
french
the
grand
tradition
died
away
he
has
put
on
record
his
judgment
that
orsi
and
saccarelli
were
the
best
writers
on
the
general
history
of
the
church
afterwards
when
other
layers
had
been
superposed
and
the
course
he
took
was
his
own
he
relied
much
on
the
canonists
ballerini
and
berardi
and
he
commended
bianchi
de
bennettis
and
the
author
of
the
anonymous
as
the
strongest
roman
antidote
to
blondel
buckeridge
and
barrow

possessed
the
largest
extant

learning
the
whole
sphere
of
church
government
was
within
its
range
and
it
enjoyed
something
of
the
official
prerogative
next
to
the
italians
he
gave
systematic
attention
to
the
french
the
conspicuous
gallicans
the
jansenists
from

at
last
he
derived

support

launoy
whom
he
regarded
as
the
original
of
bossuet
arnauld
whom
he
thought
his
superior

absent
from
his
pages
he
never
overcame
his
distrust
of
pascal
for
his
methodical
scepticism
and
his
endeavour
to
dissociate
religion
from
learning
and
he
rated
high
daniel
reply
to
the
he
esteemed
still
more
the
french
protestants
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
transformed
the
system
of
geneva
and
dort
english
theology
did
not
come
much
in
his
way
until
he
had
made
himself
at
home
with
the
italians
and
the
primary
french
then
it
abounded
he
gathered
it
in
quantities
on
two
journeys
in
and
and
he
possessed
the
english
divines
in
perfection
at
least
down
to
whitby
and
the
nonjurors
early
acquaintance
with
sir
edward
vavasour
and
lord
clifford
had
planted
a
lasting
prejudice
in
favour
of
the
english
catholic
families
which
sometimes
tinged
his
judgments
the
neglected
literature
of
the
catholics
in
england
held
a
place
in
his
scheme
of
thought
which
it
never
obtained
in
the
eyes
of
any
other
scholar
native
or
foreign
this
was
the
only
considerable
school
of
divines
who
wrote
under
persecution
and
were
reduced
to
an
attitude
of
defence
in
conflict
with
the
most
learned
intelligent
and
conciliatory
of
controversialists
they
developed
a
remarkable
spirit
of
moderation
discriminating
inferior
elements
from
the
original
and
genuine
growth
of
catholic
roots
and
their
several
declarations
and
manifestoes
from
the
restoration
onwards
were
an
inexhaustible
supply
for
irenics
therefore
they
powerfully
attracted
one
who
took
the
words
of
st
vincent
of
lérins
not
merely
for
a
flash
of
illumination
but
for
a
scientific
formula
and
guiding
principle
few
writers
interested
him
more
deeply
than
stapleton
davenport
who
anticipated
number
irishmen
such
as
caron
and
walshe
and
the
scots
barclay
the
adversary
and
friend
of
bellarmine
ramsay
the
convert
and
recorder
of
fénelon
it
may
be
that
to
an
intellect
trained
in
the
historic
process
stability
continuity
and
growth
were
terms
of
more
vivid
and
exact
significance
than
to
the
doctors
of
and
lambspring
but
when
he
came
forward
arrayed
in
the
spoils
of
italian
libraries
and
german
universities
with
the
erudition
of
centuries
and
the
criticism
of
he
sometimes
was
content
to
follow
where
forgotten
benedictines
or
franciscans
had
preceded
under
the
later
stuarts
he
seldom
quotes
contemporary
germans
unless
to
dispute
with
them
prefers
old
books
to
new
and
speaks
of
the
necessary
revision
and
renovation
of
history
he
suspected
imported
views
and
foregone
conclusions
even
in
neander
and
although
he
could
not
say
with
macaulay
that
gieseler
was
a
rascal
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
he
missed
no
opportunity
of
showing
his
dislike
for
that
accomplished
artificer
in
mosaic
looking
at
the
literature
before
him
at
england
with
gibbon
for
its
one
ecclesiastical
historian
at
germany
with
the
most
profound
of
its
divines
expecting
the
church
to
merge
in
the
state
he
inferred
that
its
historic
and
organic
unity
would
only
be
recognised
by
catholic
science
while
the
soundest
protestant
would
understand
it
least
in
later
years
kliefoth
ritschl
gass
perhaps
also
dorner
and
uhlhorn
obliged
him
to
modify
an
opinion
which
the
entire
school
of
schleiermacher
including
the
illustrious
rothe
served
only
to
confirm
germany
as
he
found
it
when
he
began
to
see
the
world
little
resembled
that
of
his
old
age
when
the
work
he
had
pursued
for
seventy
years
was
carried
forward
with
knowledge
and
power
like
his
own
by
the
best
of
his
countrymen
the
proportion
of
things
was
changed
there
was
a
religious
literature
to
be
proud
of
to
rely
on
other
nations
other
epochs
had
lost
their
superiority
as
his
own
people
advanced
and
dominated
in
the
branches
of
learning
to
which
his
life
was
given
in
everything
except
literary
history
and
epigraphies
and
there
was
no
more
need
to
look
abroad
döllinger
cosmopolitan
characteristic
diminished
he
was
more
absorbed
in
the
national
thought
and
work
and
did
not
object
to
be
called
the
most
german
of
the
germans
the
idea
that
religious
science
is
not
so
much
science
as
religion
that
it
should
be
treated
differently
from
other
matters
so
that
he
who
treats
it
may
rightly
display
his
soul

in
his
vicinity

the
lives
of

of
arc
möhler
fine
lectures
on
the
early
fathers
and
the
book
which
gratry
chose
to
entitle
a
on
döllinger
came
early
to
the
belief
that
history
ought
to
be
impersonal
that
the
historian
does
well
to
keep
out
of
the
way
to
be
humble
and
making
it
a
religious
duty
to
prevent
the
intrusion
of
all
that
betrays
his
own
position
and
quality
his
hopes
and
wishes
without
aspiring
to
the
calm
indifference
of
ranke
he
was
conscious
that
in
early
life
he
had
been
too
positive
and
too
eager
to
persuade
the
belgian
scholar
who
conversing
with
him
in
was
reminded
of
fénelon
missed
the
acuter
angles
of
his
character
he
who
in
private
intercourse
sometimes
allowed
himself
to
persist
to
contradict
and
even
to
baffle
a
bore
by
frankly
falling
asleep
would
have
declined
the
evocation
of
versailles
but
in
reasonableness
moderation
and
charity
in
general
culture
of
mind
and
the
sense
of
the
demands
of
the
progress
of
civilisation
in
the
ideal
church
for
which
he
lived
he
was
more
in
harmony
with
fénelon
than
with
many
others
who
resembled
him
in
the
character
of
their
work
he
deemed
it
catholic
to
take
ideas
from
history
and
heresy
to
take
them
into
it
when
men
gave
evidence
for
the
opposite
party
and
against
their
own
he
willingly
took
for
impartiality
what
he
could
not
always
distinguish
from
indifference
or
subdivision
he
felt
that
sincere
history
was
the
royal
road
to
religious
union
and
he
specially
cultivated
those
who
saw
both
sides
he
would
cite
with
complacency
what
clever
jesuits
raynaud
and
faure
said
for
the
reformation
mariana
and
cordara
against
their
society
when
a
rhenish
catholic
and
a
genevese
calvinist
drew
two
portraits
of
calvin
which
were
virtually
the
same
or
when
in
ficker
revision
of
böhmer
the
catholic
defended
the
emperor
frederic
ii
against
the
protestant
he
rejoiced
as
over
a
sign
of
the
advent
of
science
as
the
middle
ages
rescued
from
polemics
by
the
genial
and
uncritical
sympathy
of

there
were
catholics
who
desired
by
a
prolonged
to
derive
advantage
from
the
new
spirit
wiseman
consulted
döllinger
for
the
purpose
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
write
me
a
list
of
what
you
consider
the
best
books
for
the
history
of
the
reformation
menzel
and
buchholz
i
know
especially
any
exposing
the
characters
of
the
leading
reformers
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
he
asked
him
what
pope
there
was
whose
good
name
had
not
been
vindicated
and
döllinger
reply
that
boniface
viii
wanted
a
friend
prompted
both
wiseman
article
and
tosti
book
in
politics
as
in
religion
he
made
the
past
a
law
for
the
present
and
resisted
doctrines
which
are
and
are
not
derived
from
experience
consequently
he
undervalued
work
which
would
never
have
been
done
from
disinterested
motives
and
there
were
three
of
his
most
eminent
contemporaries
whom
he
decidedly
underestimated
having
known
thiers
and
heard
him
speak
he
felt
profoundly
the
talent
of
the
extraordinary
man
before
lanfrey
or
taine
häusser
and
bernhardt
had
so
ruined
his
credit
among
germans
that
döllinger
disgusted
by
his
advocacy
whether
of
the
revolution
of
napoleon
or
of
france
neglected
his
work
stahl
claims
to
be
accounted
an
historian
by
his
incomparably
able
book
on
the
church
government
of
the
reformation
as
a
professor
at
munich
and
afterwards
as
a
parliamentary
leader
at
berlin
he
was
always
an
avowed
partisan
döllinger
depreciated
him
accordingly
and
he
had
the
mortification
that
certain
remarks
on
the
sovereign
dialectician
of
european
conservatism
were
on
the
point
of
appearing
when
he
died
he
so
far
made
it
good
in
his
preface
that
the
thing
was
forgotten
when
gerlach
came
to
see
the
assailant
of
his
friend
but
once
when
i
spoke
of
stahl
as
the
greatest
man
born
of
a
jewish
mother
since
titus
he
thought
me
unjust
to
disraeli
most
of
all
he
misjudged
macaulay
whose
german
admirers
are
not
always
in
the
higher
ranks
of
literature
and
of
whom
ranke
even
said
that
he
could
hardly
be
called
an
historian
at
all
tried
by
the
stricter
test
he
had
no
doubt
seen
how
his
unsuggestive
fixity
and
assurance
could
cramp
and
close
a
mind
and
he
felt
more
beholden
to
the
rivals
who
produced
barillon
and
bonnet
than
to
the
author
of
so
many
pictures
and
so
much
bootless
decoration
he
tendered
a
course
of
bacon
essays
or
of
butler
and
newman
sermons
as
a
preservative
against
intemperate
dogmatism
he
denounced
macaulay
indifference
to
the
merits
of
the
inferior
cause
and
desired
more
generous
treatment
of
the
jacobites
and
the
french
king
he
deemed
it
hard
that
a
science
happily
delivered
from
the
toils
of
religious
passion
should
be
involved
in
political
and
made
to
pass
from
the
sacristy
to
the
lobby
by
the
most
brilliant
example
in
literature
to
the
objection
that
one
who
celebrates
the
victory
of
parliaments
over
monarchs
of
democracy
over
aristocracy
of
liberty
over
authority
declares
not
the
tenets
of
a
party
but
manifest
destiny
and
the
irrevocable
decree
he
would
reply
that
a
narrow
induction
is
the
bane
of
philosophy
that
the
ways
of
providence
are
not
inscribed
on
the
surface
of
things
that
religion
socialism
militarism
and
revolution
possibly
reserve
a
store
of
cogent
surprises
for
the
economist
utilitarian
and
whig
in
he
was
invited
to
prepare
a
new
edition
of
his
church
history
whilst
he
was
mustering
the
close
ranks
of
folios
which
had
satisfied
a
century
of
historians
the
world
had
moved
and
there
was
an
increase
of
raw
material
to
be
measured
by
thousands
of
volumes
the
archives
which
had
been
sealed
with
seven
seals
had
become
as
necessary
to
the
serious
student
as
his
library
every
part
of
his
studies
had
suffered
transformation
except
the
fathers
who
had
largely
escaped
the
crucible
and
the
canon
law
which
had
only
just
been
caught
by
the
historical
current
he
had
begun
when
niebuhr
was
lecturing
at
bonn
and
hegel
at
berlin
before
tischendorf
unfolded
his
first
manuscript
before
baur
discovered
the
tübingen
hypothesis
in
the
congregation
of
corinth
before
rothe
had
planned
his
treatise
on
the
primitive
church
or
ranke
had
begun
to
pluck
the
plums
for
his
modern
popes
guizot
had
not
founded
the
des
and
the
school
of
method
was
not
yet
opened
at
berlin
the
application
of
instruments
of
precision
was
just
beginning
and
what
prynne
calls
the
heroic
study
of
records
had
scarcely
molested
the
ancient
reign
of
lives
and
chronicles
none
had
worked
harder
at
his
science
and
at
himself
than
döllinger
and
the
change
around
him
was
not
greater
than
the
change
within
in
his
early
career
as
a
teacher
of
religion
he
had
often
shrunk
from
books
which
bore
no
stamp
of
orthodoxy
it
was
long
before
he
read
sarpi
or
the
or
even
ranke
which
appeared
when
he
was
and
which
astonished
him
by
the
serene
ease
with
which
a
man
who
knew
so
much
touched
on
such
delicate
ground
the
book
which
he
had
written
in
that
state
of
mind
and
with
that
conception
of
science
and
religion
had
only
a
prehistoric
interest
for
its
author
he
refused
to
reprint
it
and
declared
that
there
was
hardly
a
sentence
fit
to
stand
unchanged
he
lamented
that
he
had
lost
ten
years
of
life
in
getting
his
bearings
and
in
learning
unaided
the
most
difficult
craft
in
the
world
those
years
of
apprenticeship
without
a
master
were
the
time
spent
on
his
the
want
of
training
remained
he
could
impart
knowledge
better
than
the
art
of
learning
thousands
of
his
pupils
have
acquired
connected
views
of
religion
passing
through
the
ages
and
gathered
if
they
were
intelligent
some
notion
of
the
meaning
of
history
but
nobody
ever
learnt
from
him
the
mechanism
by
which
it
is
written
brougham
advised
the
to
begin
with
dante
and
a
distinguished
physician
informs
us
that
gibbon
grote
and
mill
made
him
what
he
is
the
men
to
whom
döllinger
owed
his
historic
insight
and
who
mainly
helped
to
develop
and
strengthen
and
direct
his
special
faculty
were
not
all
of
his
own
cast
or
remarkable
in
the
common
description
of
literary
talent
the
assistants
were
countless
but
the
masters
were
few
and
he
looked
up
with
extraordinary
gratitude
to
men
like
sigonius
antonius
augustinus
blondel
petavius
leibniz
burke
and
niebuhr
who
had
opened
the
passes
for
him
as
he
struggled
and
groped
in
the
illimitable
forest
he
interrupted
his
work
because
he
found
the
materials
too
scanty
for
the
later
middle
ages
and
too
copious
for
the
reformation
the
defective
account
of
the
albigensian
theology
which
he
had
sent
to
one
of
his
translators
never
appeared
in
german
at
paris
he
searched
the
library
for
the
missing
information
and
he
asked
rességuier
to
make
inquiry
for
the
records
of
the
inquisition
in
languedoc
thus
laying
the
foundations
of
that
which
he
published
fifty
years
later
munich
offered
such
inexhaustible
supplies
for
the
reformation
that
his
collections
overran
all
bounds
he
completed
only
that
part
of
his
plan
which
included
lutheranism
and
the
sixteenth
century
the
third
volume
published
in
containing
the
theology
of
the
reformation
is
the
most
solid
of
his
writings
he
had
miscalculated
not
his
resources
of
which
only
a
part
had
come
into
action
but
the
possibilities
of
concentration
and
compression
the
book
was
left
a
fragment
when
he
had
to
abandon
his
study
for
the
frankfort
barricades
the
peculiarity
of
his
treatment
is
that
he
contracts
the
reformation
into
a
history
of
the
doctrine
of
justification
he
found
that
this
and
this
alone
was
the
essential
point
in
luther
mind
that
he
made
it
the
basis
of
his
argument
the
motive
of
his
separation
the
root
and
principle
of
his
religion
he
believed
that
luther
was
right
in
the
cardinal
importance
he
attributed
to
this
doctrine
in
his
system
and
he
in
his
turn
recognised
that
it
was
the
cause
of
all
that
followed
the
source
of
the
reformer
popularity
and
success
the
sole
insurmountable
obstacle
to
every
scheme
of
restoration
it
was
also
for
him
the
centre
and
the
basis
of
his
antagonism
that
was
the
point
that
he
attacked
when
he
combated
protestantism
and
he
held
all
other
elements
of
conflict
cheap
in
comparison
deeming
that
they
are
not
invariable
or
not
incurable
or
not
supremely
serious
apart
from
this
there
was
much
in
protestantism
that
he
admired
much
in
its
effects
for
which
he
was
grateful
with
the
lutheran
view
of
imputation
protestant
and
catholic
were
separated
by
an
abyss
without
it
there
was
no
lasting
reason
why
they
should
be
separate
at
all
against
the
communities
that
hold
it
he
stood
in
order
of
battle
and
believed
that
he
could
scarcely
hit
too
hard
but
he
distinguished
very
broadly
the
religion
of
the
reformers
from
the
religion
of
protestants
theological
science
had
moved
away
from
the
symbolical
books
the
root
dogma
had
been
repudiated
and
contested
by
the
most
eminent
protestants
and
it
was
an
english
bishop
who
wrote
fuit
haec
doctrina
jam
a
multis
annis
ipsissimum
reformatae
ecclesiae
opprobrium
ac
est
error
non
levis
error
putidissimus
since
so
many
of
the
best
writers
resist
or
modify
that
which
was
the
main
cause
the
sole
ultimate
cause
of
disunion
it
can
not
be
logically
impossible
to
discover
a
reasonable
basis
for
discussion
therefore
conciliation
was
always
in
his
thoughts
even
his
was
a
treatise
on
the
conditions
of
reunion
he
long
purposed
to
continue
it
in
narrower
limits
as
a
history
of
that
central
doctrine
by
which
luther
meant
his
church
to
stand
or
fall
of
the
reaction
against
it
and
of
its
decline
in
when
ritschl
the
author
of
the
chief
work
upon
the
subject
spent
some
days
with
döllinger
he
found
him
still
full
of
these
ideas
and
possessing
luther
at
his
fingers
ends
this
is
the
reason
why
protestants
have
found
him
so
earnest
an
opponent
and
so
warm
a
friend
it
was
this
that
attracted
him
towards
anglicans
and
made
very
many
of
them
admire
a
roman
dignitary
who
knew
the
library
better
than
de
lugo
or
ripalda
in
the
same
spirit
he
said
to
pusey
tales
cum
sitis
jam
nostri
estis
always
spoke
of
newman
as
the
greatest
masterpiece
of
theology
that
england
has
produced
in
a
hundred
years
and
described
baxter
and
wesley
as
the
most
eminent
of
english
protestants
meaning
wesley
as
he
was
after
december
and
baxter
as
the
opponent
of
that
theory
which
was
the
source
and
the
soul
of
the
reformation
several
englishmen
who
went
to
consult
him
hope
scott
and
archdeacon
wilberforce
became
catholics
i
know
not
whether
he
urged
them
others
there
were
whom
he
did
not
urge
though
his
influence
over
them
might
have
been
decisive
in
a
later
letter
to
pusey
he
wrote
i
am
convinced
by
reading
your
that
we
are
united
inwardly
in
our
religious
convictions
although
externally
we
belong
to
two
separated
churches
he
followed
attentively
the
parallel
movements
that
went
on
in
his
own
country
and
welcomed
with
serious
respect
the
overtures
which
came
to
him
after
from
eminent
historians
when
they
were
old
men
he
and
ranke
whom
in
hot
youth
there
was
much
to
part
lived
on
terms
of
mutual
goodwill
döllinger
had
pronounced
the
theology
of
the
slack
and
trivial
and
ranke
at
one
moment
was
offended
by
what
he
took
for
an
attack
on
the
popes
his
patrimony
in
after
a
visit
to
munich
he
allowed
that
in
religion
there
was
no
dispute
between
them
that
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
the
church
as
döllinger
understood
it
he
added
that
one
of
his
colleagues
a
divine
whose
learning
filled
him
with
unwonted
awe
held
the
same
opinion
döllinger
growing
belief
that
an
approximation
of
part
of
germany
to
sentiments
of
conciliation
was
only
a
question
of
time
had
much
to
do
with
his
attitude
in
church
questions
after
the
year
if
history
can
not
confer
faith
or
virtue
it
can
clear
away
the
misconceptions
and
misunderstandings
that
turn
men
against
one
another
with
the
progress
of
incessant
study
and
meditation
his
judgment
on
many
points
underwent
revision
but
with
regard
to
the
reformation
the
change
was
less
than
he
supposed
he
learnt
to
think
more
favourably
of
the
religious
influence
of
protestantism
and
of
its
efficacy
in
the
defence
of
christianity
but
he
thought
as
before
of
the
spiritual
consequences
of
lutheranism
proper
when
people
said
of
luther
that
he
does
not
come
well
out
of
his
matrimonial
advice
to
certain
potentates
to
henry
and
to
philip
of
his
exhortations
to
exterminate
the
revolted
peasantry
of
his
passage
from
a
confessor
of
toleration
to
a
teacher
of
intolerance
he
would
not
have
the
most
powerful
conductor
of
religion
that
christianity
has
produced
in
eighteen
centuries
condemned
for
two
pages
in
a
hundred
volumes
but
when
he
had
refused
the
test
of
the
weakest
link
judging
the
man
by
his
totals
he
was
not
less
severe
on
his
theological
ethics
meinerseits
habe
ich
noch
eine
andre
schwere
anklage
gegen
ihn
zu
erheben
nämlich
die
dass
er
durch
seine
falsche
imputationslehre

bewusstseyn

menschen
auf
zwei
jahrhunderte
hinaus
verwirrt
und
corrumpirt
hat
july
the
revolution
of
during
which
he
did
not
hold
his
professorship
brought
him
forward
uncongenially
in
active
public
life
and
gave
him
the
means
of
telling
the
world
his
view
of
the
constitution
and
policy
of
the
church
and
the
sense
and
limits
of
liability
in
which
he
gave
his
advocacy
when
lecturing
on
canon
law
he
was
accustomed
to
dwell
on
the
strict
limit
of
all
ecclesiastical
authority
admitting
none
but
spiritual
powers
and
invoking
the
maxims
of
pontiffs
who
professed
themselves
guardians
not
masters
of
the
established
legislation
canones
ecclesiae
solvere
non
possumus
qui
custodes
canonum
sumus
acting
on
these
principles
in
the
paulskirche
and
at
ratisbon
he
vindicated
rome
against
the
reproach
of
oppression
argued
that
society
can
only
gain
by
the
emancipation
of
the
church
as
it
claims
no
superiority
over
the
state
and
that
both
gallicans
and
jesuits
are
out
of
date
addressing
the
bishops
of
germany
in
secret
session
at
würzburg
he
exhorted
them
to
avail
themselves
fully
of
an
order
of
things
which
was
better
than
the
old
and
to
make
no
professions
of
unconditional
allegiance
he
told
them
that
freedom
is
the
breath
of
the
catholic
life
that
it
belongs
to
the
church
of
god
by
right
divine
and
that
whatever
they
claimed
must
be
claimed
for
others
from
these
discourses
in
which
the
scholar
abandoned
the
details
by
which
science
advances
for
the
general
principles
of
the
popular
orator
the
deductions
of
liberalism
proceed
as
surely
as
the
revolution
from
the
of
sieyès
it
should
seem
that
the
key
to
his
career
lies
there
it
was
natural
to
associate
him
with
the
men
whom
the
early
promise
of
a
reforming
pope
inspired
to
identify
the
cause
of
free
societies
with
the
papacy
which
had
rosmini
for
an
adviser
ventura
for
a
preacher
gioberti
for
a
prophet
and
to
conclude
that
he
thus
became
a
trusted
representative
until
the
revolving
years
found
him
the
champion
of
a
vanished
cause
and
the
syllabus
exposed
the
illusion
and
bore
away
his
ideal
harless
once
said
of
him
that
no
good
could
be
expected
from
a
man
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
liberals
when
döllinger
made
persecution
answer
both
for
the
decline
of
spain
and
the
fall
of
poland
he
appeared
to
deliver
the
common
creed
of
whigs
and
he
did
not
protest
against
the
american
who
called
him
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
liberal
catholics
his
hopefulness
in
the
midst
of
the
movement
of
his
ready
acquiescence
in
the
fall
of
ancient
powers
and
institutions
his
trust
in
rome
and
in
the
abstract
rights
of
germans
suggested
a
reminiscence
of
the
in
lamennais
returning
with
montalembert
after
his
appeal
to
rome
met
lacordaire
at
munich
and
during
a
banquet
given
in
their
honour
he
learnt
privately
that
he
was
condemned
the
three
friends
spent
that
afternoon
in
döllinger
company
and
it
was
after
he
had
left
them
that
lamennais
produced
the
encyclical
and
said

who
was
the
earliest
of
the
travellers
describes
döllinger
as
he
found
him
in

il
serait

citer

for

years
he
remained
in
correspondence
with
many
of
these
early
friends
who
in
the
educational
struggle
which
ended
with
the
ministry
of
falloux
in
revived
the
leading
maxims
of
the
rejected
master

deathbed

döllinger
used
to
visit
his
former
visitors
in
various
parts
of
france
and
at
paris
he
attended
the
salon
of
madame
swetchine
one
day
at
the
seminary
he
inquired
who
were
the
most
promising
students
dupanloup
pointed
out
a
youth
who
was
the
hope
of
the
church
and
whose
name
was
ernest
renan
although
the
men
who
were
drawn
to
him
in
this
way
formed
the
largest
and
cluster
with
which
he
came
in
contact
there
was
more
private
friendship
than
mutual
action
or
consultation
between
them
the
unimpassioned
german
who
had
no
taste
for
ideas
released
from
controlling
fact
took
little
pleasure
in
the
impetuous
declamation
of
the
breton
and
afterwards
pronounced
him
inferior
to
loyson
neither
of
the
men
who
were
in
the
confidence
of
both
has
intimated
that
he
made
any
lasting
impression
on
lamennais
who
took
leave
of
him
without
discussing
the
action
of
rome
döllinger
never
sought
to
renew
acquaintance
with
lacordaire
when
he
had
become
the
most
important
man
in
the
church
of
france
he
would
have
a
prejudice
to
overcome
against
him
whom
circourt
called
the
most
ignorant
man
in
the
academy
who
believed
that
erasmus
ended
his
days
at
rotterdam
unable
to
choose
between
rome
and
wittemberg
and
that
the
irish
obtained
through
the
right
to
worship
in
their
own
way
he
saw
more
of
dupanloup
without
feeling
as
deeply
as
renan
the
rare
charm
of
the
combative
prelate
to
an
exacting
and
reflective
scholar
to
whom
even
the
large
volume
of
heavy
erudition
in
which
rosmini
defended
the
seemed
superficial
there
was
incongruity
in
the
attention
paid
to
one
of
whom
he
heard
that
he
promoted
the
council
that
he
took
boniface
for
st
wilfrid
and
that
he
gave
the
memorable
advice
des
after
a
visit
from
the
bishop
of
orleans
he
sat
down
in
dismay
to
compose
the
most
elementary
of
his
books
seeing
the
inferiority
of
falloux
as
a
historian
he
never
appreciated
the
strong
will
and
cool
brain
of
the
statesman
who
overawed
tocqueville
eckstein
the
obscure
but
thoughtful
originator
of
much
liberal
feeling
among
his
own
set
encouraged
him
in
the
habit
of
depreciating
the
attainments
of
the
french
clergy
which
was
confirmed
by
the
writings
of
the
most
eminent
among
them
darboy
and
lasted
until
the
appearance
of
duchesne
the
politics
of
montalembert
were
so
heavily
charged
with
conservatism
that
in
defiance
of
such
advisers
as
lacordaire
ravignan
and
dupanloup
he
pronounced
in
favour
of
the
author
of
the
saying
je
suis
pour
contre
la
révolte
and
boasted
that
in
entering
the
academy
he
had
attacked
the
revolution
not
of
but
and
that
guizot
who
received
him
had
nothing
to
say
in
reply
there
were
many
things
human
and
divine
on
which
they
could
not
feel
alike
but
as
the
most
urgent
eloquent
and
persevering
of
his
catholic
friends
gifted
with
knowledge
and
experience
of
affairs
and
dwelling
in
the
focus
it
may
be
that
on
one
critical
occasion
when
religion
and
politics
intermingled
he
influenced
the
working
of
döllinger
mind
but
the
plausible
reading
of
his
life
which
explains
it
by
his
connection
with
such
public
men
as
montalembert
de
decker
and
gladstone
is
profoundly
untrue
and
those
who
deem
him
a
liberal
in
any
scientific
use
of
the
term
miss
the
keynote
of
his
work
the
political
party
question
has
to
be
considered
here
because
in
fact
it
is
decisive
a
liberal
who
thinks
his
thought
out
to
the
end
without
flinching
is
forced
to
certain
conclusions
which
colour
to
the
root
every
phase
and
scene
of
universal
history
he
believes
in
upward
progress
because
it
is
only
recent
times
that
have
striven
deliberately
and
with
a
zeal
according
to
knowledge
for
the
increase
and
security
of
freedom
he
is
not
only
tolerant
of
error
in
religion
but
is
specially
indulgent
to
the
less
dogmatic
forms
of
christianity
to
the
sects
which
have
restrained
the
churches
he
is
austere
in
judging
the
past
imputing
not
error
and
ignorance
only
but
guilt
and
crime
to
those
who
in
the
dark
succession
of
ages
have
resisted
and
retarded
the
growth
of
liberty
which
he
identifies
with
the
cause
of
morality
and
the
condition
of
the
reign
of
conscience
döllinger
never
subjected
his
mighty
vision
of
the
stream
of
time
to
correction
according
to
the
principles
of
this
unsympathising
philosophy
never
reconstituted
the
providential
economy
in
agreement
with
the
whig
théodicée
he
could
understand
the
zoroastrian
simplicity
of
history
in
black
and
white
for
he
wrote
obgleich
man
allerdings
sagen
kann
das
tiefste
thema
der
weltgeschichte
sei
der
kampf
der
knechtschaft
oder
gebundenheit
mit
der
freiheit
auf
dem
intellectuellen
religiösen
politischen
und
socialen
gebiet
but
the
scene
which
lay
open
before
his
mind
was
one
of
greater
complexity
deeper
design
and
infinite
intellect
he
imagined
a
way
to
truth
through
error
and
outside
the
church
not
through
unbelief
and
the
diminished
reign
of
christ
lacordaire
in
the
cathedral
pulpit
offering
his
thanks
to
voltaire
for
the
good
gift
of
religious
toleration
was
a
figure
alien
to
his
spirit
he
never
substituted
politics
for
religion
as
the
test
of
progress
and
never
admitted
that
they
have
anything
like
the
dogmatic
certainty
and
sovereignty
of
religious
or
of
physical
science
he
had
all
the
liberality
that
consists
of
common
sense
justice
humanity
enlightenment
the
wisdom
of
canning
or
guizot
but
revolution
as
the
breach
of
continuity
as
the
renunciation
of
history
was
odious
to
him
and
he
not
only
refused
to
see
method
in
the
madness
of
marat
or
dignity
in
the
end
of
robespierre
but
believed
that
the
best
measures
of
leopold
the
most
intelligent
reformer
in
the
era
of
repentant
monarchy
were
vitiated
and
frustrated
by
want
of
adaptation
to
custom
common
party
divisions
represented
nothing
scientific
to
his
mind
and
he
was
willing
like
de
quincey
to
accept
them
as
corresponding
halves
of
a
necessary
whole
he
wished
that
he
knew
half
as
much
as
his
neighbour
somerville
but
he
possessed
no
natural
philosophy
and
never
acquired
the
emancipating
habit
which
comes
from
a
life
spent
in
securing
progress
by
shutting
one
eyes
to
the
past
alle
wissenschaft
steht
und
ruht
auf
ihrer
historischen
entwicklung
sie
lebt
von
ihrer
traditionellen
vergangenheit

he
was
moved
not
by
the
gleam
of
reform
after
the
conclave
of
pius
but
by
pius
vii
the
impression
made
upon
him
by
the
character
of
that
pope
and
his
resistance
to
napoleon
had
much
to
do
with
his
resolution
to
become
a
priest
he
took
orders
in
the
church
in
the
days
of
revival
as
it
issued
from
oppression
and
the
eclipse
of
hierarchy
and
he
entered
its
service
in
the
spirit
of
sailer
cheverus
and
doyle
the
mark
of
that
time
never
left
him
when
newman
asked
him
what
he
would
say
of
the
pope
journey
to
paris
for
the
coronation
of
the
emperor
he
hardly
recognised
the
point
of
the
question
he
opposed
in
the
renewal
of
that
precedent
but
to
the
end
he
never
felt
what
people
mean
when
they
remark
on
the
proximity
of
to
vincennes
döllinger
was
too
much
absorbed
in
distant
events
to
be
always
a
close
observer
of
what
went
on
near
him
and
he
was
therefore
not
so
much
influenced
by
contact
with
contemporary
history
as
men
who
were
less
entirely
at
home
in
other
centuries
he
knew
about
all
that
could
be
known
of
the
ninth
in
the
nineteenth
his
superiority
deserted
him
though
he
informed
himself
assiduously
his
thoughts
were
not
there
he
collected
from
hormayr
radowitz
capponi
much
secret
matter
of
the
last
generation
and
where
brewer
had
told
him
about
oxford
and
plantier
about
louis
philippe
there
were
landmarks
as
when
knoblecher
the
missionary
set
down
krophi
and
mophi
on
his
map
of
africa
he
deferred
at
once
to
the
competent
authority
he
consulted
his
able
colleague
hermann
on
all
points
of
political
economy
and
used
his
advice
when
he
wrote
about
england
having
satisfied
himself
he
would
not
reopen
these
questions
when
after
hermann
death
he
spent
some
time
in
the
society
of
roscher
a
not
less
eminent
economist
and
of
all
men
the
one
who
most
resembled
himself
in
the
historian
faculty
of
rethinking
the
thoughts
and
realising
the
knowledge
the
ignorance
the
experience
the
illusions
of
a
given
time
he
had
lived
in
many
cities
and
had
known
many
important
men
he
had
sat
in
three
parliamentary
assemblies
had
drawn
constitutional
amendments
had
been
consulted
upon
the
policy
and
the
making
of
ministries
and
had
declined
political
office
but
as
an
authority
on
recent
history
he
was
scarcely
equal
to
himself
once
it
became
his
duty
to
sketch
the
character
of
a
prince
whom
he
had
known
there
was
a
report
that
this
sovereign
had
only
been
dissuaded
from
changing
his
religion
and
abolishing
the
constitution
by
the
advice
of
an
archbishop
and
of
a
famous
parliamentary
jurist
and
the
point
of
the
story
was
that
the
protestant
doctrinaire
had
prevented
the
change
of
religion
and
the
archbishop
had
preserved
the
constitution
it
was
too
early
to
elucidate
these
court
mysteries
instead
of
which
there
is
a
remarkable
conversation
about
religion
wherein
it
is
not
always
clear
whether
the
prince
is
speaking
or
the
professor
or
schelling
although
he
had
been
translated
into
several
languages
and
was
widely
known
in
his
own
country
he
had
not
yet
built
himself
a
european
name
at
oxford
in
when
james
mozley
asked
whom
he
would
like
to
see
he
said
the
men
who
had
written
in
the
on
dante
and
luther
mozley
was
himself
one
of
the
two
and
he
introduced
him
to
the
other
at
oriel
after
years
when
the
writer
on
dante
occupied
a
high
position
in
the
church
and
had
narrowly
escaped
the
highest
that
visit
was
returned
but
he
had
no
idea
that
he
had
once
received
döllinger
in
his
college
rooms
and
hardly
believed
it
when
told
in
germany
the
serried
learning
of
the
the
author
energy
and
decisiveness
in
public
assemblies
caused
him
to
stand
forth
as
an
accepted
spokesman
and
for
a
season
threw
back
the
reticent
explorer
steering
between
the
shallows
of
anger
and
affection
in
that
stage
the
found
him
and
induced
him
to
write
a
book
of
controversy
in
the
shape
of
history
here
was
an
anonymous
person
who
as
newman
described
it
calls
one
pope
a
weak
and
venal
dunce
and
another
a
sacrilegious
swindler
an
infamous
convict
and
an
heresiarch
in
the
munich
faculty
there
was
a
divine
who
affirmed
that
the
church
would
never
get
over
it
döllinger
undertook
to
vindicate
the
insulted
see
of
rome
and
he
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
at
three
conspicuous
men
of
whom
he
thought
ill
in
point
both
of
science
and
religion
he
spoke
of
gieseler
as
the
flattest
and
most
leathern
of
historians
he
accused
baur
of
frivolity
and
want
of
theological
conviction
and
he
wished
that
he
knew
as
many
circumlocutions
for
untruth
as
there
are
arabian
synonyms
for
a
camel
that
he
might
do
justice
to
bunsen
without
violation
of
courtesy
the
weight
of
the
new
testimony
depended
on
the
discovery
of
the
author
adversaries
had
assigned
it
to
hippolytus
the
foremost
european
writer
of
the
time
venerated
as
a
saint
and
a
father
of
the
church
döllinger
thought
them
right
and
he
justified
his
sincerity
by
giving
further
reasons
for
a
conclusion
which
made
his
task
formidable
even
for
such
dexterity
as
his
own
having
thus
made
a
concession
which
was
not
absolutely
inevitable
he
resisted
the
inference
with
such
richness
of
illustration
that
the
fears
of
the
doubting
colleague
were
appeased
in
france
by
pitra
influence
the
book
was
reviewed
without
making
known
that
it
supported
the
authorship
of
hippolytus
which
is
still
disputed
by
some
impartial
critics
and
was
always
rejected
by
newman
und
the
mark
of
döllinger
official
assent
and
concurrence
came
out
in
his
next
book
showed
the
ebb
he
came
originally
from
the
romantic
school
where
history
was
honeycombed
with
imagination
and
conjecture
and
the
first
important
book
he
gave
to
a
pupil
in
was
creuzer
in
he
denounced
the
rationalism
of
lobeck
in
investigating
the
but
in
he
preferred
him
as
a
guide
to
those
who
proceed
by
analogy
with
increase
of
knowledge
had
come
increase
of
restraining
caution
and
sagacity
the
critical
acumen
was
not
greater
in
the
that
when
he
wrote
on
the

instead
of
being
employed
in
a
chosen
cause
upon
fixed
lines
for
welcome
ends

is
applied

ernst
von
lasaulx
a
man
of
rich
and
noble
intellect
was
lecturing
next
door
on
the
philosophy
and
religion
of
greece
and
everybody
heard
about
his
indistinct
mixture
of
dates
and
authorities
and
the
spell
which
his
unchastened
idealism
cast
over
students
lasaulx
who
brilliantly
carried
on
the
tradition
of
creuzer
who
had
tasted
of
the
mythology
of
schelling
who
was
to
baader
and
nephew
to
görres
wrote
a
volume
on
the
fall
of
hellenism
which
he
brought
in
manuscript
and
read
to
döllinger
at
a
sitting
the
effect
on
the
dissenting
mind
of
the
hearer
was
a
warning
and
there
is
reason
to
date
from
those
two
hours
in
a
more
severe
use
of
materials
and
a
stricter
notion
of
the
influence
which
the
end
of
an
inquiry
may
lawfully
exert
on
the
pursuit
of
it
und
which
came
out
in
gave
lasaulx
his
revenge
it
is
the
most
positive
and
of
histories
and
owes
nothing
to
the
fancy
the
author
refused
the
aid
of
scandinavia
to
illustrate
german
mythology
and
he
was
rewarded
long
after
when
caspari
of
christiania
and
conrad
maurer
met
at
his
table
and
confirmed
the
discoveries
of
bugge
but
the
account
of
paganism
ends
with
a
significant
parallel
in
december
a
torch
flung
by
a
soldier
burnt
the
temple
on
the
capitol
to
the
ground
in
august
another
roman
soldier
set
fire
to
the
temple
on
mount
sion
the
two
sanctuaries
perished
within
a
year
making
way
for
the
faith
of
men
still
hidden
in
the
back
streets
of
rome
when
the
hellenist
read
this
passage
it
struck
him
deeply
then
he
declared
that
it
was
hollow
all
was
over
at
jerusalem
but
at
rome
the
ruin
was
restored
and
the
smoke
of
sacrifice
went
up
for
centuries
to
come
from
the
altar
of
capitoline
jove
in
this
work
designed
as
an
introduction
to
christian
history
the
apologist
betrays
himself
when
he
says
that
no
greek
ever
objected
to
slavery
and
when
out
of
pages
on
paganism
half
a
page
is
allotted
to
the
moral
system
of
aristotle
that
his
aristotelian
chapter
was
weak
the
author
knew
but
he
said
that
it
was
not
his
text
to
make
more
of
it
he
did
not
mean
that
a
christian
divine
may
be
better
employed
than
in
doing
honour
to
a
heathen
but
having
to
narrate
events
and
the
action
of
causes
he
regarded
christianity
more
as
an
organism
employing
sacramental
powers
than
as
a
body
of
speculative
ideas
to
cast
up
the
total
of
moral
and
religious
knowledge
attained
by
seneca
epictetus
and
plutarch
to
measure
the
line
and
rate
of
progress
since
socrates
to
compare
the
point
reached
by
hermas
and
justin
is
an
inquiry
of
the
highest
interest
for
writers
yet
to
come
but
the
quantitative
difference
of
acquired
precept
between
the
later
pagan
and
the
early
christian
is
not
the
key
to
the
future
the
true
problem
is
to
expose
the
ills
and
errors
which
christ
the
healer
came
to
remove
the
measure
must
be
taken
from
the
depth
of
evil
from
which
christianity
had
to
rescue
mankind
and
its
history
is
more
than
a
continued
history
of
philosophical
theories
newman
who
sometimes
agreed
with
döllinger
in
the
letter
but
seldom
in
the
spirit
and
who
distrusted
him
as
a
man
in
whom
the
divine
lived
at
the
mercy
of
the
scholar
and
whose
burden
of
superfluous
learning
blunted
the
point
and
the
edge
of
his
mind
so
much
liked
what
he
heard
of
this
book
that
being
unable
to
read
it
he
had
it
translated
at
the
oratory
the
work
thus
heralded
never
went
beyond
the
first
volume
completed
in
the
autumn
of
which
was
received
by
the
of
berlin
as
the
most
acceptable
narrative
of
the
founding
of
christianity
and
as
the
largest
concession
ever
made
by
a
catholic
divine
the
author
following
the
ancient
ways
and
taking
with
reuss
the
new
testament
as
it
stands
made
no
attempt
to
establish
the
position
against
modern
criticism
up
to
this
prescription
and
tradition
held
the
first
place
in
his
writings
and
formed
his
in
all
controversy
his
energy
in
upholding
the
past
as
the
rule
and
measure
of
the
future
distinguished
him
even
among
writers
of
his
own
communion
in
und
he
explained
his
theory
of
development
under
which
flag
the
notion
of
progress
penetrates
into
theology
and
which
he
held
as
firmly
as
the
balancing
element
of
perpetuity
in

he
conceived
no
bounds
to
the
unforeseen
resources
of
christian
thought
and
faith
a
philosopher
in
whose
works
he
would
not
have
expected
to
find
the
scientific
expression
of
his
own
idea
has
a
passage
bearing
close
analogy
to
what
he
was
putting
forward
in
it
is
then
in
the
change
to
a
higher
state
of
form
or
composition
that
development
differs
from
growth
we
must
carefully
distinguish
development
from
mere
increase
it
is
the
acquiring
not
of
greater
bulk
but
of
new
forms
and
structures
which
are
adapted
to
higher
conditions
of
existence
it
is
the
distinction
which
uhhorn
draws
between
the
terms
and
just
then
after
sixteen
years
spent
in
the
church
of
rome
newman
was
inclined
to
guard
and
narrow
his
theory
on
the
one
hand
he
taught
that
the
enactments
and
decisions
of
ecclesiastical
law
are
made
on
principles
and
by
virtue
of
prerogatives
which
antea
in
the
church
of
the
apostles
and
fathers
but
he
thought
that
a
divine
of
the
second
century
on
seeing
the
roman
catechism
would
have
recognised
his
own
belief
in
it
without
surprise
as
soon
as
he
understood
its
meaning
he
once
wrote
if
i
have
said
more
than
this
i
think
i
have
not
worked
out
my
meaning
and
was
confused
whether
the
minute
facts
of
history
will
bear
me
out
in
this
view
i
leave
to
others
to
determine
döllinger
would
have
feared
to
adopt
a
view
for
its
own
sake
without
knowing
how
it
would
be
borne
out
by
the
minute
facts
of
history
his
own
theory
of
development
had
not
the
same
ingenious
simplicity
and
he
thought
newman
brilliant
book
unsound
in
detail
but
he
took
high
ground
in
asserting
the
undeviating
fidelity
of
catholicism
to
its
principle
in
this
his
last
book
on
the
primitive
church
as
in
his
early
lectures
he
claims
the
unswerving
unity
of
faith
as
a
divine
prerogative
in
a
memorable
passage
of
the
möhler
had
stated
that
there
is
no
better
security
than
the
law
which
pervades
human
society
which
preserves
harmony
and
consistency
in
national
character
which
makes
lutheranism
perpetually
true
to
luther
and
islamism
to
the
koran
speaking
in
the
name
of
his
own
university
the
rector
described
him
as
a
receptive
genius
part
of
his
career
displays
a
quality
of
assimilation
acquiescence
and
even
adaptation
not
always
consistent
with
superior
originality
or
intense
force
of
character
his
the
strongest
book
with
the
which
catholics
had
produced
in
the
century
was
laid
down
on
known
lines
and
scarcely
effected
so
much
novelty
and
change
as
the
writings
of
kampschulte
and
kolde
his
book
on
the
first
age
of
the
church
takes
the
critical
points
as
settled
without
special
discussion
he
appeared
to
receive
impulse
and
direction
limit
and
colour
from
his
outer
life
his
importance
was
achieved
by
the
force
within
circumstances
only
conspired
to
mould
a
giant
of
commonplace
excellence
and
average
ideas
and
their
influence
on
his
view
of
history
might
long
be
traced
no
man
of
like
spirituality
of
equal
belief
in
the
supreme
dignity
of
conscience
systematically
allowed
as
much
as
he
did
for
the
empire
of
chance
surroundings
and
the
action
of
home
and
school
and
place
of
worship
upon
conduct
he
must
have
known
that
his
own
mind
and
character
as
an
historian
was
not
formed
by
effort
and
design
from
early
impressions
and
a
life
spent
to
his
fiftieth
year
in
a
rather
unvaried
professional
circle
he
contracted
homely
habits
in
estimating
objects
of
the
greater
world
and
his
imagination
was
not
prone
to
vast
proportions
and
wide
horizons
he
inclined
to
apply
the
rules
and
observation
of
domestic
life
to
public
affairs
to
reduce
the
level
of
the
heroic
and
sublime
and
history
in
his
hands
lost
something
both
in
terror
and
in
grandeur
he
acquired
his
art
in
the
long
study
of
earlier
times
where
materials
are
scanty
all
that
can
be
known
of
cæsar
or
charlemagne
or
gregory
would
hold
in
a
dozen
volumes
a
library
would
not
be
sufficient
for
charles
or
lewis
xvi
extremely
few
of
the
ancients
are
really
known
to
us
in
detail
as
we
know
socrates
or
cicero
or
augustine
but
in
modern
times
since
petrarca
there
are
at
least
two
thousand
actors
on
the
public
stage
whom
we
see
by
the
revelations
of
private
correspondence
besides
letters
that
were
meant
to
be
burnt
there
are
a
man
secret
diaries
his
autobiography
and
the
recollections
of
his
friends
notes
on
the
margins
of
books
the
report
of
his
trial
if
he
is
a
culprit
and
the
evidence
for
beatification
if
he
is
a
saint
here
we
are
on
a
different
footing
and
we
practise
a
different
art
when
dealing
with
phocion
or
dunstan
or
with
richelieu
or
swift
in
one
case
we
remain
perforce
on
the
surface
of
character
which
we
have
not
the
means
of
analysing
we
have
to
be
content
with
conjecture
with
probable
explanations
and
obvious
motives
we
must
constantly
allow
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
reserve
sentence
the
science
of
character
comes
in
with
modern
history
döllinger
had
lived
too
long
in
the
ages
during
which
men
are
seen
mostly
in
outline
and
never
applied
an
historical
psychology
distinct
from
that
of
private
experience
great
men
are
something
different
from
an
enlarged
repetition
of
average
and
familiar
types
and
the
working
and
motive
of
their
minds
is
in
many
instances
the
exact
contrary
of
ordinary
men
living
to
avoid
contingencies
of
danger
and
pain
and
sacrifice
and
the
weariness
of
constant
thinking
and
precaution
we
are
apt
to
judge
extraordinary
men
by
our
own
standard
that
is
to
say
we
often
suppose
them
to
possess
in
an
extraordinary
degree
those
qualities
which
we
are
conscious
of
in
ourselves
or
others
this
is
the
easiest
way
of
conceiving
their
characters
but
not
the
truest
they
differ
in
kind
rather
than
in
degree
we
can
not
understand
cromwell
or
shaftesbury
sunderland
or
penn
by
studies
made
in
the
parish
the
study
of
intricate
and
subtle
character
was
not
habitual
with
döllinger
and
the
result
was
an
extreme
dread
of
unnecessary
condemnation
he
resented
being
told
that
ferdinand
and
that
henry
iii
and
lewis
xiii
were
in
the
coarse
terms
of
common
life
assassins
that
elizabeth

william

ordered
the
extirpation
of

rewarded
the
murderers
as
he
had
rewarded
those
of

that
lewis

sent

and
james

was
privy
to
the
assassination
plot
when
he
met
men
less
mercifully
given
than
himself
he
said
that
they
were
hanging
judges
with
a
malthusian
propensity
to
repress
the
growth
of
population
this
indefinite
generosity
did
not
disappear
when
he
had
long
outgrown
its
early
cause
it
was
revived
and
his
view
of
history
was
deeply
modified
in
the
course
of
the
great
change
in
his
attitude
in
the
church
which
took
place
between
the
years
and
döllinger
used
to
commemorate
his
visit
to
rome
in
as
an
epoch
of
emancipation
he
had
occasionally
been
denounced
and
a
keen
eye
had
detected
latent
pantheism
in
his
but
he
had
not
been
formally
censured
if
he
had
once
asserted
the
value
of
nationality
in
the
church
he
was
vehement
against
it
in
religion
and
if
he
had
joined
in
deprecating
the
dogmatic
decree
in
he
was
silent
afterwards
by
protestants
he
was
still
avoided
as
the
head
and
front
of
offending
ultramontanism
and
when
the
historical
commission
was
instituted
at
munich
by
disciples
of
the
berlin
school
he
was
passed
over
at
first
and
afterwards
opposed
when
public
matters
took
him
to
berlin
in
he
sought
no
intercourse
with
the
divines
of
the
faculty
the
common
idea
of
his
was
expressed
by
kaulbach
in
a
drawing
which
represented
the
four
chief
reformers
riding
on
one
horse
pursued
by
a
scavenger
with
the
unmistakable
features
of
their
historian
he
was
received
with
civility
at
rome

not
with
cordiality
the
pope
sent
to
cesena
for
a
manuscript
which
it
was
reported
that
he
wished
to
consult
and
his
days
were
spent
profitably
between
the
minerva
and
the
vatican
where
he
was
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
galileo
tower
it
was
his
fortune
to
have
for
pilot
and

this
was
written
on
february
in

döllinger
spoke
on
the
roman
question
in
the
odeon
at
munich
and
explained
himself
more
fully
in
the
autumn
in
the
most
popular
of
all
his
books
the
argument
of
und
was
that
the
churches
which
are
without
the
pope
drift
into
many
troubles
and
maintain
themselves
at
a
manifest
disadvantage
whereas
the
church
which
energetically
preserves
the
principle
of
unity
has
a
vast
superiority
which
would
prevail
but
for
its
disabling
and
discrediting
failure
in
civil
government
that
government
seemed
to
him
as
legitimate
as
any
in
the
world
and
so
needful
to
those
for
whose
sake
it
was
instituted
that
if
it
should
be
overthrown
it
would
by
irresistible
necessity
be
restored
those
for
whose
sake
it
was
instituted
were
not
the
roman
people
but
the
catholic
world
that
interest
while
it
lasted
was
so
sacred
that
no
sacrifice
was
too
great
to
preserve
it
not
even
the
exclusion
of
the
clerical
order
from
secular
office
the
book
was
an
appeal
to
catholics
to
save
the
papal
government
by
the
only
possible
remedy
and
to
rescue
the
roman
people
from
falling
under
what
the
author
deemed
a
tyranny
like
that
of
the
convention
he
had
acquired
his
politics
in
the
atmosphere
of
from
the
potential
liberality
of
men
like
radowitz
who
declared
that
he
would
postpone
every
political
or
national
interest
to
that

the
last

and
tocqueville
the
minister
who
occupied
rome
his
object
was
not
materially
different
from
that
of
antonelli
and
mérode
but
he
sought
it
by
exposing
the
faults
of
the
papal
government
during
several
centuries
and
the
hopelessness
of
all
efforts
to
save
it
from
the
revolution
unless
reformed
he
wrote
to
an
english
minister
that
it
could
not
be
our
policy
that
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
should
be
subject
to
a
foreign
potentate

vaticinations
his
correspondent
replied
you
have
exhibited
the
gradual
departure
of
the
government
in
the
states
of
the
church
from
all
those
conditions
which
made
it
tolerable
to
the
sense
and
reason
of
mankind
and
have
i
think
completely
justified
in
principle
if
not
in
all
the
facts
the
conduct
of
those
who
have
determined
to
do
away
with
it

policy
of
exalting
the

at

expense

the
protestants

than
half

for
a
moment
the
resentment
of
outraged
rome
the
pope
on
a
report
from
theiner
spoke
of
the
book
as
one
that
might
do
good
others
said
that
it
was
pointless
that
its
point
was
not
where
the
author
meant
it
to
be
that
the
handle
was
sharper
than
the
blade
it
was
made
much
more
clear
that
the
pope
had
governed
badly
than
that
russia
or
great
britain
would
gain
by
his
supremacy
the
cold
analysis
the
diagnosis
by
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
was
not
the
work
of
an
observer
dazzled
by
admiration
or
blinded
by
affection
it
was
a
step
a
first
unconscious
unpremeditated
step
in
the
process
of
detachment
the
historian
here
began
to
prevail
over
the
divine
and
to
judge
church
matters
by
a
law
which
was
not
given
from
the
altar
it
was
the
outcome
of
a
spirit
which
had
been
in
him
from
the
beginning
his
english
translator
had
uttered
a
mild
protest
against
his
severe
treatment
of
popes
his
censure
of
the
reformation
had
been
not
as
that
of
bossuet
but
as
that
of
baxter
and
bull
in
gladstone
remarked
that
he
would
answer
every
objection
but
never
proselytised
in
he
rested
the
claims
of
the
church
on
the
common
law
and
bade
the
hierarchy
remember
that
national
character
is
above
free
will
die
nationalität
ist
etwas
der
freiheit
des
menschlichen
willens
entrücktes
geheimnissvolles
und
in
ihrem
letzen

gewolltes
in
his
he
began
by
surrendering
the
main
point
that
a
man
who
so
vilified
the
papacy
might
yet
be
an
undisputed
saint
in
the
he
flung
away
a
favourite
argument
by
avowing
that
paganism
developed
by
its
own
lines
and
laws
untouched
by
christianity
until
the
second
century
and
as
with
the
gentiles
so
with
the
sects
he
taught
in
the
suppressed
chapter
of
his
history
that
their
doctrines
followed
a
normal
course
and
he
believed
so
far
in
the
providential
mission
of
protestantism
that
it
was
idle
to
talk
of
reconciliation
until
it
had
borne
all
its
fruit
he
exasperated
a
munich
colleague
by
refusing
to
pronounce
whether
gregory
and
innocent
had
the
right
to
depose
emperors
or
otho
and
henry
to
depose
popes
for
he
thought
that
historians
should
not
fit
theories
to
facts
but
should
be
content
with
showing
how
things
worked
much
secret
and
suppressed
antagonism
found
vent
in
when
one
who
had
been
his
assistant
in
writing
the
and
was
still
his
friend
declared
that
he
would
be
a
heretic
whenever
he
found
a
backing
those
with
whom
he
actively
coalesced
felt
at
times
that
he
was
incalculable
that
he
pursued
a
separate
line
and
was
always
learning
whilst
others
busied
themselves
less
with
the
unknown
this
note
of
distinctness
and
solitude
set
him
apart
from
those
about
him
during
his
intimacy
with
the
most
catholic
of
anglican
prelates
forbes
and
with
the
lamented
liddon
and
it
appeared
still
more
when
the
denominational
barrier
of
his
sympathy
was
no
longer
marked
and
he
who
had
stood
in
the
rank
almost
with
de
maistre
and
perrone
found
himself
acting
for
the
same
ends
with
their
enemies
when
he
delivered
a
studied
eulogy
on
mignet
exalted
the
authority
of
laurent
in
religious
history
and
of
ferrari
in
civil
and
urged
the
bavarian
academy
to
elect
taine
as
a
writer
who
had
but
one
rival
in
france
leaving
it
to
uncertain
conjecture
whether
the
man
he
meant
was
renan
in
theory
it
was
his
maxim
that
a
man
should
guard
against
his
friends
when
he
first
addressed
the
university
as
rector
saying
that
as
the
opportunity
might
never
come
again
he
would
employ
it
to
utter
the
thoughts
closest
to
his
heart
he
exhorted
the
students
to
be
always
true
to
their
convictions
and
not
to
yield
to
surroundings
and
he
invoked
rightly
or
wrongly
the
example
of
burke
his
favourite
among
public
men
who
turning
from
his
associates
to
obey
the
light
within
carried
the
nation
with
him
a
gap
was
apparent
now
between
the
spirit
in
which
he
devoted
himself
to
the
service
of
his
church
and
that
of
the
men
whom
he
most
esteemed
at
that
time
he
was
nearly
the
only
german
who
knew
newman
well
and
appreciated
the
grace
and
force
of
his
mind
but
newman
even
when
he
was
angry
assiduously
distinguished
the
pontiff
from
his
court
there
will
necessarily
always
be
round
the
pope
people
who
are
not
subjects
of
that
supernatural
wisdom
which
is
his
prerogative
for
myself
certainly
i
have
found
myself
in
a
different
atmosphere
when
i
have
left

judged
that
the
prerogative
even
of
natural
wisdom
was
often
wanting
in
the
government
of
the
church
and
the
sense
of
personal
attachment
if
he
ever
entertained
it
had
worn
away
in
the
friction
and
familiarity
of
centuries
after
the
disturbing
interlude
of
the
roman
question
he
did
not
resume
the
history
of
christianity
the
second
century
with
its
fragments
of
information
its
scope
for
piercing
and
conjecture
he
left
to
lightfoot
with
increasing
years
he
lost
the
disposition
to
travel
on
common
ground
impregnably
occupied
by
specialists
where
he
had
nothing
of
his
own
to
tell
and
he
preferred
to
work
where
he
could
be
a
pathfinder
problems
of
church
government
had
come
to
the
front
and
he
proposed
to
retraverse
his
subject
narrowing
it
into
a
history
of
the
papacy
he
began
by
securing
his
foundations
and
eliminating
legend
he
found
so
much
that
was
legendary
that
his
critical
preliminaries
took
the
shape
of
a
history
of
fables
relating
to
the
papacy
many
of
these
were
harmless
others
were
devised
for
a
purpose
and
he
fixed
his
attention
more
and
more
on
those
which
were
the
work
of
design
the
question
how
far
the
persistent
production
of
spurious
matter
had
permanently
affected
the
genuine
constitution
and
theology
of
the
church
arose
before
his
mind
as
he
composed
the
des
he
indicated
the
problem
without
discussing
it
the
matter
of
the
volume
was
generally
neutral
but
its
threatening
import
was
perceived
and
hostile
critics
sent
reviews
of
it
to
one
theological
journal
since
he
first
wrote
on
these
matters
thirty
years
earlier
the
advance
of
competitive
learning
had
made
it
a
necessity
to
revise
statements
by
all
accessible
lights
and
to
subject
authorities
to
a
closer
scrutiny
the
increase
in
the
rigour
of
the
obligation
might
be
measured
by
tischendorf
who
after
renewing
the
text
of
the
new
testament
in
seven
editions
had
more
than
three
thousand
changes
to
make
in
the
eighth
the
old
pacific
superficial
method
yielded
no
longer
what
would
be
accepted
as
certain
knowledge
having
made
himself
master
of
the
reconstructive
process
that
was
carried
on
a
little
apart
from
the
main
chain
of
durable
literature
in
academic
transactions
in
dissertations
and
periodicals
he
submitted
the
materials
he
was
about
to
use
to
the
exigencies
of
the
day
without
it
he
would
have
remained
a
man
of
the
last
generation
distanced
by
every
disciple
of
the
new
learning
he
went
to
work
with
nothing
but
his
trained
and
organised
common
sense
starting
from
no
theory
and
aiming
at
no
conclusion
if
he
was
beyond
his
contemporaries
in
the
mass
of
expedient
knowledge
he
was
not
before
them
in
the
strictness
of
his
tests
or
in
sharpness
or
boldness
in
applying
them
he
was
abreast
as
a
critic
he
was
not
ahead
he
did
not
innovate
the
parallel
studies
of
the
time
kept
pace
with
his
and
his
judgments
are
those
which
are
accepted
generally
his
critical
mind
was
pliant
to
assent
where
he
must
to
reject
where
he
must
and
to
doubt
where
he
must
his
submission
to
external
testimony
appeared
in
his
panegyric
of
our
indian
empire
where
he
overstated
the
increase
of
population
informed
of
his
error
by
one
of
his
translators
he
replied
that
the
figures
had
seemed
incredible
also
to
him
but
having
verified
he
found
the
statement
so
positively
made
that
he
did
not
venture
to
depart
from
it
if
inclination
ever
swayed
his
judgment
it
was
in
his
despair
of
extracting
a
real
available
buddha
from
the
fables
of
southern
india
which
was
conquered
at
last
by
the
ablest
of
pupils
he
was
less
apprehensive
than
most
of
his
english
friends
in
questions
relating
to
the
old
testament
and
in
the
new
he
was
disposed
at
times
to
allow
some
force
to
muratori
fragment
as
to
the
person
of
the
evangelist
who
is
least
favourable
to
peter
and
was
puzzled
at
the
zeal
of
the
speaker
commentator
as
to
the
second
epistle
of
the
apostle
he
held
to
the
epistles
of
ignatius
with
the
tenacity
of
a
caroline
prelate
and
was
grateful
to
de
rossi
for
a
chronological
point
in
their
favour
he
rejected
the
attacks
of
lucius
on
the
most
valued
passages
in
philo
and
stood
with
gass
against
weingarten
argument
on
the
life
of
anthony
and
the
origin
of
monasticism
he
resisted
overbeck
on
the
epistle
to
diognetus
and
thought
ebrard
all
astray
as
to
the
culdees
there
was
no
conservative
antiquarian
whom
he
prized
higher
than
le
blant
yet
he
considered
ruinart
credulous
in
dealing
with
acts
of
early
martyrs
a
pupil
on
whose
friendship
he
relied
made
an
effort
to
rescue
the
legends
of
the
conversion
of
germany
but
the
master
preferred
the
unsparing
demolitions
of
rettberg
capponi
and
carl
hegel
were
his
particular
friends
but
he
abandoned
them
without
hesitation
for
scheffer
boichorst
the
iconoclast
of
early
italian
chronicles
and
never
consented
to
read
the
learned
reply
of
da
lungo
the
carried
the
critical
inquiry
a
very
little
way
but
he
went
on
with
the
subject
after
the
donation
of
constantine
came
the
forged
decretals
which
were
just
then
printed
for
the
first
time
in
an
accurate
edition
döllinger
began
to
be
absorbed
in
the
long
train
of
hierarchical
fictions
which
had
deceived
men
like
gregory
thomas
aquinas
and
cardinal
bellarmine
which
he
traced
up
to
the
false
areopagite
and
down
to
the
laminæ
granatenses
these
studies
became
the
chief
occupation
of
his
life
they
led
to
his
excommunication
in
and
carried
him
away
from
his
early
system
for
this
neither
syllabus
nor
ecumenical
council
was
needed
neither
crimes
nor
scandals
were
its
distant
cause
the
history
of
church
government
was
the
influence
which
so
profoundly
altered
his
position
some
trace
of
his
researches
at
an
early
period
of
their
progress
appears
in
what
he
wrote
on
the
occasion
of
the
vatican
council
especially
in
the
fragment
of
an
ecclesiastical
pathology
which
was
published
under
the
name
of
janus
but
the
history
itself
which
was
the
main
and
characteristic
work
of
his
life
and
was
pursued
until
the
end
was
never
published
or
completed
he
died
without
making
it
known
to
what
extent
within
what
limit
the
ideas
with
which
he
had
been
so
long
identified
were
changed
by
his
later
studies
and
how
wide
a
trench
had
opened
between
his
earlier
and
his
later
life
twenty
years
of
his
historical
work
are
lost
for
history
the
revolution
in
method
since
he
began
to
write
was
partly
the
better
use
of
old
authorities
partly
the
accession
of
new
döllinger
had
devoted
himself
to
the
one
in
he
passed
to
the
other
in
for
definite
objects
he
had
often
consulted
manuscripts
but
the
harvest
was
stacked
away
and
had
scarcely
influenced
his
works
in
the
use
and
knowledge
of
unpublished
matter
he
still
belonged
to
the
old
school
and
was
on
a
level
with
neander
although
in
later
years
he
printed
six
or
seven
volumes
of
inedita
like
mai
and
theiner
he
did
not
excel
as
an
editor
and
this
part
of
his
labours
is
notable
chiefly
for
its
effect
on
himself
he
never
went
over
altogether
to
men
like
schottmüller
who
said
of
him
that
he
made
no
research
hat
nicht
meaning
that
he
had
made
his
mind
up
about
the
templars
by
the
easy
study
of
wilkins
michelet
schottmüller
himself
and
perhaps
a
hundred
others
but
had
not
gone
underground
to
the
mines
they
delved
in
fustel
de
coulanges
at
the
time
of
his
death
was
promoting
the
election
of
the
bishop
of
oxford
to
the
institute
on
the
ground
that
he
surpassed
all
other
englishmen
in
his
acquaintance
with
manuscripts
döllinger
agreed
with
their
french
rival
in
his
estimate
of
our
english
historian
but
he
ascribed
less
value
to
that
part
of
his
acquirements
he
assured
the
bavarian
academy
that
freeman
who
reads
print
but
nevertheless
mixes
his
colours
with
brains
is
the
author
of
the
most
profound
work
on
the
middle
ages
ever
written
in
this
country
and
is
not
only
a
brilliant
writer
and
a
sagacious
critic
but
the
most
learned
of
all
our
countrymen
ranke
once
drew
a
line
at
after
which
he
said
we
still
want
help
from
unprinted
sources
the
world
had
moved
a
good
deal
since
that
cautious
innovation
and
after
enormous
and
excessive
masses
of
archive
were
brought
into
play
the
italian
revolution
opened
tempting
horizons
in
döllinger
spent
his
vacation
in
the
libraries
of
vienna
and
venice
at
vienna
by
an
auspicious
omen
sickel
who
was
not
yet
known
to
greater
germany
as
the
first
of
its
mediæval
palæographers
showed
him
the
sheets
of
a
work
containing
carolingian
acts
unknown
to
böhmer
who
had
just
died
with
the
repute
of
being
the
best
authority
on
imperial
charters
during
several
years
döllinger
followed
up
the
discoveries
he
now
began
theiner
sent
him
documents
from
the
one
of
his
friends
shut
himself
up
at
trent
and
another
at
bergamo
strangers
ministered
to
his
requirements
and
huge
quantities
of
transcripts
came
to
him
from
many
countries
conventional
history
faded
away
the
studies
of
a
lifetime
suddenly
underwent
transformation
and
his
view
of
the
last
six
centuries
was
made
up
from
secret
information
gathered
in
thirty
european
libraries
and
archives
as
many
things
remote
from
current
knowledge
grew
to
be
certainties
he
became
more
confident
more
independent
and
more
isolated
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
his
youth
went
to
pieces
against
the
new
criticism
of
and
the
revelation
of
the
unknown
which
began
on
a
very
large
scale
in
during
four
years
of
transition
occupied
by
this
new
stage
of
study
he
abstained
from
writing
books
whenever
some
local
occasion
called
upon
him
to
speak
he
spoke
of
the
independence
and
authority
of
history
in
cases
of
collision
with
the
church
he
said
that
a
man
should
seek
the
error
in
himself
but
he
spoke
of
the
doctrine
of
the
universal
church
and
it
did
not
appear
that
he
thought
of
any
living
voice
or
present
instructor
he
claimed
no
immunity
for
philosophy
but
history
he
affirmed
left
to
itself
and
pursued
disinterestedly
will
heal
the
ills
it
causes
and
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
set
the
university
in
the
place
of
the
hierarchy
some
of
his
countrymen
were
deeply
moved
by
the
measures
which
were
being
taken
to
restore
and
to
confirm
the
authority
of
rome
and
he
had
impatient
colleagues
at
the
university
who
pressed
him
with
sharp
issues
of
uncompromising
logic
he
himself
was
reluctant
to
bring
down
serene
research
into
troublesome
disputation
and
wished
to
keep
history
and
controversy
apart
his
hand
was
forced
at
last
by
his
friends
abroad
whilst
he
pursued
his
isolating
investigations
he
remained
aloof
from
a
question
which
in
other
countries
and
other
days
was
a
summary
and
effective
test
of
impassioned
controversy
persecution
was
a
problem
that
had
never
troubled
him
it
was
not
a
topic
with
theoretical
germans
the
necessary
books
were
hardly
available
and
a
man
might
read
all
the
popular
histories
and
theologies
without
getting
much
further
than
the
spanish
inquisition
ranke
averse
from
what
is
unpleasant
gave
no
details
the
gravity
of
the
question
had
never
been
brought
home
to
döllinger
in
forty
years
of
public
teaching
when
he
approached
it
as
late
as
he
touched
lightly
representing
the
intolerance
of
protestants
to
their
disadvantage
while
that
of
catholics
was
a
bequest
of
imperial
rome
taken
up
in
an
emergency
by
secular
powers
in
no
way
involving
the
true
spirit
and
practice
of
the
church
with
this
light
footfall
the
topic
which
has
so
powerful
a
leverage
slipped
into
the
current
of
his
thought
the
view
found
favour
with
ambrose
de
lisle
who
having
read
the
to
a
was
indignant
with
those
who
commit
the
church
to
a
principle
often
resisted
or
ignored
newman
would
admit
to
no
such
compromise
is
not
the
miraculous
infliction
of
judgments
upon
blasphemy
lying
profaneness
in
the
apostles
day
a
sanction
of
infliction
upon
the
same
by
a
human
hand
in
the
times
of
the
inquisition
ecclesiastical
rulers
may
punish
with
the
sword
if
they
can
and
if
it
is
expedient
or
necessary
to
do
so
the
church
has
a
right
to
make
laws
and
to
enforce
them
with
temporal
punishments
the
question
came
forward
in
france
in
the
wake
of
the
temporal
power
liberal
defenders
of
a
government
which
made
a
principle
of
persecution
had
to
decide
whether
they
approved
or
condemned
it
where
was
their
liberality
in
one
case
or
their
catholicity
in
the
other
it
was
the
simple
art
of
their
adversaries
to
press
this
point
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
a
french
priest
took
upon
him
to
declare
that
intolerance
far
from
being
a
hidden
shame
was
a
pride
and
a
glory

strongly

there
would
have
been

he
had
said
from

chair
what
he
wrote
in
his
book

certain
passages
were
struck
out
of
the
printed
text
by
the
cautious

of
those

le
docteur
döllinger
nous
a
rendu
à
tous
un
grand
service
this
was
not
the
first
impression
of
montalembert
he
deplored
the
odeon
lectures
as
usurping
functions
divinely
assigned
not
to
professors
but
to
the
episcopate
as
a
grief
for
friends
and
a
joy
for
enemies
when
the
volume
came
he
still
objected
to
the
policy
to
the
chapter
on
england
and
to
the
cold
treatment
of
sixtus
at
last
he
admired
without
reserve
nothing
better

been
written
since
bossuet
the
judgment
on
the
roman

severe
was
just
and

going
on
in
his
position
and
his
affections
as
he
came
to
regard
toleration
as
the
supreme
affair
at

he
solemnly
declared
that
the
inquisitor

as
horrible
as

no

in
his
book
on
rome
vous
avez
bien
fait
de
ne
rien
dire
de
spirituel
quant
à
présent
prata
le
reste
viendra
en
son
temps
he
avowed
that
spiritual
autocracy
is
worse
than
political
that
evil
passions
which
had
triumphed
in
the
state
were
triumphant
in
the
church
that
to
send
human
beings
to
the
stake
with
a
crucifix
before
them
was
the
act
of
a
monster
or
a
maniac
he
was
dying
but
whilst
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
lamenting
that
he
had
lived
too
long
he
wished
for
one
more
conference
with
the
old
friend
with
whom
years
before
in
a
less
anxious
time
he
had
discussed
the
theme
of
religion
and
liberty
this
was
in
february
and
for
several
years
he
had
endeavoured
to
teach
döllinger
his
antagonism
and
to
kindle
in
him
something
of
his
gloomy
and
passionate
fervour
on
the
one
point
on
which
all
depended
döllinger
arrived
slowly
at
the
contemplation
of
deeper
issues
than
that
of
churchmen
or
laymen
in
political
offices
of
roman
or
german
pupils
in
theological
chairs
after
seeing
baron
arnim
in
he
lost
the
hope
of
saving
the
papal
government
and
ceased
to
care
about
the
things
he
had
contended
for
in
and
a
time
came
when
he
thought
it
difficult
to
give
up
the
temporal
power
and
yet
revere
the
holy
see
he
wrote
to
montalembert
that
his
illusions
were
failing
ich
bin
sehr
es
ist
so
vieles
in
der
kirche
anders
gekommen
als
ich
es
mir
vor
jahren
gedacht
und
rosenfarbig
ausgemalt
hatte
he
learnt
to
speak
of
spiritual
despotism
almost
in
the
words
of
his
friend
the
point
of
junction
between
the
two
orders
of
ideas
is
the
use
of
fire
for
the
enforcement
of
religion
on
which
the
french
were
laying
all
their
stress
in
frankreich
bewegt

gibt
october
the
syllabus
had
not
permanently
fixed
his
attention
upon
it
two
years
later
the
matter
was
put
more
definitely
and
he
found
himself
with
little
real
preparation
turning
from
antiquarian
curiosities
and
brought
face
to
face
with
the
radical
question
of
life
and
death
if
ever
his
literary
career
was
influenced
by
his
french
alliances
by
association
with
men
in
the
throng
for
whom
politics
decided
and
all
the
learning
of
the
schools
did
not
avail
the
moment
was
when
he
resolved
to
write
on
the
inquisition
the
popular
account
which
he
drew
up
appeared
in
the
newspapers
in
the
summer
of
and
although
he
did
not
mean
to
burn
his
ships
his
position
as
an
official
defender
of
the
holy
see
was
practically
at
an
end
he
wrote
rapidly
at
short
notice
and
not
in
the
steady
course
of
progressive
acquisition
ficker
and
winkelmann
have
since
given
a
different
narrative
of
the
step
by
which
the
inquisition
came
into
existence
and
the
praise
of
gregory
as
a
man
sincerely
religious
who
kept
aloof
was
a
mark
of
haste
in
the
work
which
he
was
using
there
was
no
act
by
that
pontiff
but
if
he
had
had
time
to
look
deeper
he
would
not
have
found
him
in
this
respect
different
from
his
contemporaries
there
is
no
uncertainty
as
to
the
author
feeling
towards
the
infliction
of
torture
and
death
for
religion
and
the
purpose
of
his
treatise
is
to
prevent
the
nailing
of
the
catholic
colours
to
the
stake
the
spirit
is
that
of
the
early
lectures
in
which
he
said
diese
schutzgewalt
der
kirche
ist
rein
geistlich
sie
kann
also
auch
einen
solchen
öffentlichen
hartnäckigen
und
sonst
unheilbaren
gegner
der
kirche
nur
seiner
rein
geistlichen
kirchlichen
rechte
berauben
compared
with
the
sweeping
vehemence
of
the
frenchmen
who
preceded
the
restrained
moderation
of
language
the
abstinence
from
the
use
of
general
terms
leaves
us
in
doubt
how
far
the
condemnation
extended
and
whether
he
did
more
in
fact
than
deplore
a
deviation
from
the
doctrine
of
the
first
centuries
kurz
darauf
trat
ein
umschwung
ein
den
man
wohl
einen
abfall
von
der
alten
lehre
nennen
darf
und
der
sich
ausnimmt
als
ob
die
kaiser
die
lehrmeister
der
bischöfe
geworden
seien
he
never
entirely
separated
himself
in
principle
from
the
promoters
the
agents
the
apologists
he
did
not
believe
with
hefele
that
the
spirit
survives
that
there
are
men
not
content
with
eternal
flames
who
are
ready
to
light
up
new
smithfields
many
of
the
defenders
were
his
intimate
friends
the
most
conspicuous
was
the
only
colleague
who
addressed
him
with
the
familiar
german
speaking
of
two
or
three
men
of
whom
one
martens
had
specially
attacked
the
false
liberalism
which
sees
no
good
in
the
inquisition
he
wrote
sie
werden
sich
noch
erinnern
wie
hoch
ich
solche
männer
stelle
he
differed
from
them
widely
but
he
differed
academically
and
this
was
not
the
polish
or
precaution
of
a
man
who
knows
that
to
assail
character
is
to
degrade
and
to
betray
one
cause
the
change
in
his
own
opinions
was
always
before
him
although
convinced
that
he
had
been
wrong
in
many
of
the
ideas
and
facts
with
which
he
started
he
was
also
satisfied
that
he
had
been
as
sincere
and
true
to
his
lights
in
as
in
there
was
no
secret
about
the
inquisition
and
its
observances
were
published
and
republished
in
fifty
books
but
in
his
early
days
he
had
not
read
them
and
there
was
not
a
german
from
basel
to
königsberg
who
could
have
faced
a
in
the
or
the
or
who
had
ever
read
percin
or
paramo
if
lacordaire
disconnected
dominic
from
the
practice
of
persecution
döllinger
had
done
the
same
thing
before
him
weit
entfernt
wie
man
ihm
wohl
vorgeworfen
hat
sich
dabei
gewalt
und
verfolgung
zu
erlauben
oder
gar
der

zu
werden
wirkte
er
nicht

sondern
den
irrthum
befehdend
nur
durch
ruhige
belehrung
und
erörterung
if
newman
a
much
more
cautious
disputant
thought
it
substantial
truth
to
say
that
rome
never
burnt
heretics
there
were
things
as
false
in
his
own
early
writings
if
möhler
in
the
religious
wars
diverted
attention
from
catholic
to
protestant
atrocities
he
took
the
example
from
his
friend
book
which
he
was
reviewing
there
may
be
startling
matter
in
locatus
and
pegna
but
they
were
officials
writing
under
the
strictest
censorship
and
nobody
can
tell
when
they
express
their
own
private
thoughts
there
is
a
copy
of
suarez
on
which
a
priest
has
written
the
marginal
ejaculation
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
nous
but
suarez
had
to
send
the
manuscript
of
his
most
aggressive
book
to
rome
for
revision
and
döllinger
used
to
insist
on
the
testimony
of
his
secretary
in
walton
that
he
disavowed
and
detested
the
interpolations
that
came
back
the
french
group
unlike
him
in
spirit
and
motive
but
dealing
with
the
same
opponents
judged
them
freely
and
gave
imperative
utterance
to
their
judgments
while
döllinger
said
of
veuillot
that
he
meant
well
but
did
much
good
and
much
evil
montalembert
called
him
a
hypocrite

never
understood
party
divisions
in
this
tragic
way

was
provided
with
religious
explanations
for
the
living
and
the
dead
and
his
maxims
in
regard
to
contemporaries
governed
and
attenuated
his
view
of
every
historical
problem

the
writers
of
his
acquaintance
who
were
unfaltering
advocates
of
the
holy
office
for
philips
and
gams

for

who
expiated
devious
passages
of
early
youth
amongst
other
penitential
works
with
large
volumes
in
honour
of
gregory

had
always
the

mode

he
regretted
as
he
grew
old
the
hardness
and
severity
of
early
days
and
applied
the
same
inconclusive
deduction
from
his
own
experience
to
the
past

comparing
baronius

he
sometimes
distrusted
his
favourite
argument
of
ignorance
and
early
prepossessions
and
felt
that
there
was
presumption
and
unreality
in
tendering
such
explanations
to
men
like
the
bollandist
de
buck
de
rossi
whom
the
institute
elected
in
preference
to
mommsen

windischmann

he
himself

been
accused

bringing
forward
as
a
rival

would
say
that
knowledge
may
be
a
burden
and
not
a
light
that
the

of
doing
justice

the
aspiration
of

of

from
the
crusades
to

to
the
front

discourse

never

the
subject

nature

disclosed

then
appeared
that
a
copy
of
the
had
been
sent
to
döllinger
from
würzburg
years
before
and
that
he
had
never
adverted
to
the
fact
that
the
burning
of
heretics
came
fully
armed
from
the
brain
of
one
man
and
was
the
invention
of
a
heretic
who
became
its
first
victim
at
rome
he
discussed
the
council
of
trent
with
theiner
and
tried
to
obtain
permission
for
him
to
publish
the
original
acts
pius
ix
objected
that
none
of
his
predecessors
had
allowed
it
and
theiner
answered
that
none
of
them
had
defined
the
immaculate
conception
in
a
paper
which
döllinger
drew
up
he
observed
that
pallavicini
can
not
convince
that
far
from
proving
the
case
against
the
artful
servite
the
pettiness
of
his
charges
indicates
that
he
has
no
graver
fault
to
find
so
that
nothing
but
the
production
of
the
official
texts
can
enforce
or
disprove
the
imputation
that
trent
was
a
scene
of
tyranny
and
intrigue
his
private
belief
then
was
that
the
papers
would
disprove
the
imputation
and
vindicate
the
council
when
theiner
found
it
possible
to
publish
his
döllinger
also
printed
several
private
diaries
chiefly
from
mendham
collection
at
the
bodleian
but
the
correspondence
between
rome
and
the
legates
is
still
in
its
integrity
kept
back
the
two
friends
had
examined
it
both
were
persuaded
that
it
was
decisive
but
they
judged
that
it
decided
in
opposite
ways
theiner
the
official
guardian
of
the
records
had
been
forbidden
to
communicate
them
during
the
vatican
council
and
he
deemed
the
concealment
prudent
what
passed
in
rome
under
pius
ix
would
he
averred
suffer
by
comparison
according
to
döllinger
the
suppressed
papers
told
against
trent

after
his
last
visit
to
the
marciana
he
thought
more
favourably
of
father
paul
sharing
the
admiration
which
venetians
feel
for
the
greatest
writer
of
the
republic
and
falling
little
short
of
the
judgments
which
macaulay
inscribed
after
each
perusal
in
the
copy
at
inveraray
apart
from
his
chief
work
he
thought
him
a
great
historian
and
he
rejected
the
suspicion
that
he
professed
a
religion
which
he
did
not
believe
he
even
fancied
that
the
manuscript
which
in
fact
was
forwarded
with
much
secrecy
to
archbishop
abbot
was
published
against
his
will
the
intermediate
seekers
who
seem
to
skirt
the
border
such
as
grotius
ussher
praetorius
and
the
other
celebrated
venetian
de
dominis
interested
him
deeply
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
irenics
and
the
religious
problem
was
part
motive
of
his
incessant
study
of
shakespeare
both
in
early
life
and
when
he
meditated
joining
in
the
debate
between
simpson
rio
bernays
and
the
his
estimate
of
his
own
work
was
low
he
wished
to
be
remembered
as
a
man
who
had
written
certain
books
but
who
had
not
written
many
more
his
collections
constantly
prompted
new
and
attractive
schemes
but
his
way
was
strewn
with
promise
unperformed
and
abandoned
from
want
of
concentration
he
would
not
write
with
imperfect
materials
and
to
him
the
materials
were
always
imperfect
perpetually
engaged
in
going
over
his
own
life
and
reconsidering
his
conclusions
he
was
not
depressed
by
unfinished
work
when
a
sanguine
friend
hoped
that
all
the
contents
of
his
hundred
would
come
into
use
he
answered
that
perhaps
they
might
if
he
lived
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
he
seldom
wrote
a
book
without
compulsion
or
the
aid
of
energetic
assistants

account
of
mediæval
sects
dated
was
on
the
stocks
for
half
a
century

discourse
on
the
templars

at
his
last
appearance
in
public
had
been
always
before
him
since
a
conversation
with
michelet
about
the
year
years
lay
between
his
text
to
the
of
cornelius
and
his
last
return
to
dante
when
he
began
to
fix
his
mind
on
the
constitutional
history
of
the
church
he
proposed
to
write
first
on
the
times
of
innocent
xi
it
was
the
age
he
knew
best
in
which
there
was
most
interest
most
material
most
ability
when
divines
were
national
classics
and
presented
many
distinct
types
of
religious
thought
when
biblical
and
historical
science
was
founded
and
catholicism
was
presented
in
its
most
winning
guise
the
character
of
odescalchi
impressed
him
by
his
earnestness
in
sustaining
a
strict
morality
fragments
of
this
projected
work
reappeared
in
his
lectures
on
louis
and
in
his
last
publication
on
the
casuists
the
lectures
betray
the
decline
of
the
tranquil
idealism
which
had
been
the
admiration
and
despair
of
friends
opposition
to
rome
had
made
him
like
his
ultramontane
allies
in
france
more
indulgent
to
the
ancient
gallican
enemy
he
now
had
to
expose
the
vice
of
that
system
which
never
roused
the
king
conscience
and
served
for
sixty
years
from
the
remonstrance
of
caussin
to
the
anonymous
warning
of
fénelon
as
the
convenient
sanction
of
absolutism
in
the
work
on
ethics
which
is
his
farthest
the
moral
point
of
view
prevails
over
every
other
and
conscience
usurps
the
place
of
theology
canon
law
and
scholarship
this
was
his
tribute
to
a
new
phase
of
literature
the
last
he
was
to
see
which
was
beginning
to
put
ethical
knowledge
above
metaphysics
and
politics
as
the
central
range
of
human
progress
morality
veracity
the
proper
atmosphere
of
ideal
history
became
the
paramount
interest
when
he
was
proposed
for
a
degree
the
most
eloquent
lips
at

silenced
for
ever
whilst

the
patriotic
quality
was
recognised
in
the
address
of
the
berlin
professors
who
say
that
by
upholding
the
independence
of
the
national
thought
whilst
he
enriched
it
with
the
best
treasure
of
other
lands
he
realised
the
ideal
of
the
historian
he
became
more
german
in
extreme
old
age
and
less
impressive
in
his
idiomatic
french
and
english
than
in
his
own
language
the
lamentations
of

thought
good

and
the
first
of

diluted
somewhat
his
admiration
for
the
country
of

and
bossuet
in
spite
of
politics
his
feeling
for
english
character
for
the
moral
quality
of
english
literature
never
changed
and
he
told
his
own
people
that
their
faults
are
not
only
very
near
indeed
to
their
virtues
but
are
sometimes
more
apparent
to
the
observer
the
belief
in
the
fixity
and

the
irish
question

describing
ireland
a
thousand

everybody
has
felt
that
his
power
was
out
of
proportion
to
his
work
and
that
he
knew
too
much
to
write
it
was
so
much
better
to
hear
him
than
to
read
all
his
books

the

of
what
he
was
will
pass

him
the

said
that
he
surpassed

hefele

assigned
causes
which
limited
his
greatness
as
a
writer
perhaps
even
as

but
he
has
declared
that
no
man
had
the
same
knowledge
and
intelligence
of
history
in
general
and
of
religious
history
which
is
its
most
essential
element
and
he
affirms
what
some
have
doubted
that
he
possessed
the
rare
faculty
of
entering
into
alien
thought
none
of
those
who
knew

who
knew
him

to
which
he
belonged
by
the
full
fruition
of
his
powers
and
the
completeness
of
his
knowledge
will
ever
qualify
these
judgments
it
is
right
to
add
that
in
spite
of
boundless
reading
there
was
no
lumber
in
his
mind
and
in
spite
of
his
classical
learning
little
ornament
among
the
men
to
be
commemorated
here
he
stands
alone
throughout
the
measureless
distance
which
he
traversed
his
movement
was
against
his
wishes
in
pursuit
of
no
purpose
in
obedience
to
no
theory
under
no
attraction
but
historical
research
alone
it
was
given
to
him
to
form
his
philosophy
of
history
on
the
largest
induction
ever
available
to
man
and
whilst
he
owed

it
is
one
of
the
conditions
inseparable
from

often
misunderstood
and
sometimes
judged
unfairly
even
when

no
one
who
has
watched

to

to
imagine

alone
he
knows
that
even
where
he
has
committed
no

he
must
pay
tribute
to
the
fallibility
of
mankind
and
that
where
he
is

he
must
also
pay
tribute
to
his
own

is
a
natural
law

the
purer

the
more
single

aim
the
less

he
be

its
penalties
the

career
is
bound
up
with
that
of
some
school
or
party
will
estimate
the
value
of
his
opponents
censures
by
the
worth
which
he
attributes
to
the
undiscriminating
praise
of
his
friends
but
he
who
has
devoted
himself
to
the
development
of
principles
which
will
not
always
bend
to
the
dictates
of
expediency
will
have
no
such
short
way
of
dealing
with
objections
his
independence
will
frequently
and
inexorably
demand
the
sacrifice
of
interests
to
truth
of
what
is
politic
to
what
is
right
and
whenever
he
makes
that
sacrifice
he
will
appear
a
traitor
to
those
whom
he
is
most
anxious
to
serve
while
his
act
will
be
hailed
by
those
who
are
farthest
from
sharing
his
opinions
as
a
proof
of
secret
sympathy
and
harbinger
of
future
alliance
thus
the
censure
which
he
incurs
will
most
often
come
from
those
whose
views
are
essentially
his
own
and
the
very
matter
which
calls
it
forth
will
be
that
which
elicits
the
applause
of
adversaries
who
can
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
either
in
the
truth
of
his
opinions
in
the
integrity
of
his
motives
or
in
the
sincerity
of
his
aims
there
are
few
men
living
whose
career
has
been
more
persistently
misinterpreted
more
bitterly
assailed
or
more
ignorantly
judged
than
the
illustrious
person
who
is
the
head
in

of
the
church

which
we
belong
cardinal
wiseman
has
been
for
many
years
the
chief
object
of
the
attacks
of
those
who
have
desired
to
injure
or
degrade
our
community
he
is
not
only
the
canonical
chief
of
english
catholics
but
his
ability
and
the
devotion
of
his
life
to
their
cause
have
made
him
their
best
representative
and
their
most
powerful
champion
no
prelate
in
christendom
is
more
fully
trusted
by
the
holy
see
or
exercises
a
more
extensive
personal
influence
or
enjoys
so
wide
a
literary
renown
upon
him
therefore
intolerance
and
fanaticism
have
concentrated
their
malice
he
has
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
that
hatred
which
the
holiness
of
catholicism
inspires
in
its
enemies
and
the
man
who
has
never
been
found
wanting
when
the
cause
of
the
church
was
at
stake
may
boast
with
a
not
unworthy
pride
of
the
indifference
with
which
he
has
encountered
the
personal
slander
of
a
hostile
press
the
catholics
of
this
country
are
attached
to
cardinal
wiseman
by
warmer
feelings
and
more
personal
ties
than
those
of
merely
ecclesiastical
subordination
it
has
been
his
privilege
to
gather
the
spiritual
fruits
of
the
catholic
emancipation
act
and
the
history
of
english
catholicism
has
been
for
a
whole
generation
bound
up
with
his
name
that
immense
change
in
the
internal
condition
of
the
church
in
england
which
distinguishes
our
days
from
the
time
of
milner
has
grown
up
under
his
influence
and
has
been
in
great
part
his
work
we
owe
it
to
him
that
we
have
been
brought
into
closer
intercourse
with
rome
and
into
contact
with
the
rest
of
europe
by
his
preaching
and
his
spiritual
direction
he
has
transformed
the
devotions
of
our
people
while
his
lectures
and
writings
have
made
protestants
familiar
with
catholic
ideas
and
have
given
catholics
a
deeper
insight
into
their
own
religion
as
a
controversialist
he
influenced
the
oxford
movement
more
deeply
than
any
other
catholic
as
director
of
the
chief
literary
organ
of
catholics
during
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
rendered
services
to
our
literature
and
overcame
difficulties
which
none
are
in
a
better
position
to
appreciate
than
those
who
are
engaged
in
a
similar
work
and
as
president
of
oscott
he
acquired
the
enduring
gratitude
of
hundreds
who
owed
to
his
guidance
the
best
portion
of
their
training
these
personal
relations
with
english
catholics
which
have
made
him
a
stranger
to
none
and
a
benefactor
to
all
have
at
the
same
time
given
him
an
authority
of
peculiar
weight
amongst
them
with
less
unity
of
view
and
tradition
than
their
brethren
in
other
lands
they
were
accustomed
in
common
with
the
rest
of
englishmen
to
judge
more
independently
and
to
speak
more
freely
than
is
often
possible
in
countries
more
exclusively
catholic
their
minds
are
not
all
cast
in
the
same
mould
nor
their
ideas
derived
from
the
same
stock
but
all
alike
from
bishop
to
layman
identify
their
cause
with
that
of
the
cardinal
and
feel
that
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
people
no
diversity
of
opinion
ought
to
interfere
with
unity
of
action
no
variety
of
interest
with
identity
of
feeling
no
controversy
with
the
universal
reverence
which
is
due
to
the
position
and
character
of
the
archbishop
of
westminster
in
this
spirit
the
catholic
body
have
received
cardinal
wiseman
latest
publication
his
reply
to
the
address
of
his
clergy
on
his
return
from
rome
he
speaks
in
it
of
the
great
assemblage
of
the
episcopate
and
of
their
address
to
the
holy
father
among
the
bishops
there
present
he
was
the
most
conspicuous
and
he
was
president
of
the
commission
to
which
the
preparation
of
their
address
was
intrusted
no
account
of
it
therefore
can
be
more
authentic
than
that
which
he
is
able
to
give
the
reserve
imposed
by
his
office
and
by
the
distinguished
part
he
had
to
bear
has
been
to
some
extent
neutralised
by
the
necessity
of
refuting
false
and
exaggerated
rumours
which
were
circulated
soon
after
the
meeting
and
particularly
two
articles
which
appeared
in
on
the
and
of
july
and
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
address
written
by
cardinal
wiseman
contained
most
violent
attacks
on
all
the
fundamental
principles
of
modern
society
after
replying
in
detail
to
the
untruths
of
this
newspaper
the
cardinal
proceeds
as
follows
with
far
greater
pain
i
feel
compelled
to
advert
to
a
covert
insinuation
of
the
same
charges
in
a
publication
avowedly
catholic
and
edited
in
my
own
diocese
consequently
canonically
subject
to
my
correction
should
such
a
misstatement
made
under
my
own
eyes
be
passed
over
by
me
it
might
be
surmised
that
it
could
not
be
contradicted
and
whether
chronologically
it
preceded
or
followed
the
french
account
it
evidently
becomes
my
duty
to
notice
it
as
french
bishops
have
considered
it
theirs
to
correct
the
inaccuracies
of
their
native
writers
otherwise
in
a
few
years
we
might
find
reference
made
as
to
a
recognised
catholic
authority
for
the
current
and
unreproved
statement
of
what
occurred
at
rome
to
home
and
foreign
and
that
in
a
matter
on
which
reprehension
would
have
been
doubly
expected
if
merited
in
its
first
number
the
address
which
has
i
believe
wonderfully
escaped
the
censure
of
protestant
and
infidel
journals
is
thus
spoken
of
this
address
is
said
to
be
a
compromise
between
one
which
took
the
violent
course
of
recommending
that
major
excommunication
should
be
at
once
pronounced
against
the
chief
enemies
of
the
temporal
power
by
name
and
one
still
more
moderate
than
the
present
home
and
foreign
now
this
very
charge
about
recommending
excommunication
is
the
one
made
by
the
french
paper
against
my
address
but
leaving
to
the
writer
the
chance
of
an
error
in
this
application
of
his
words
i
am
bound
to
correct
it
to
whomever
it
refers
he
speaks
of
only
two
addresses
the
distinction
between
them
implies
severe
censure
on
one
i
assure
you
that
neither
contained
the
recommendation
or
the
sentiment
alluded
to
my
brethren
i
repeat
that
it
pains
me
to
have
to
contradict
the
repetition
in
my
own
diocese
of
foreign
accusations
without
the
smallest
pains
taken
to
verify
or
disprove
them
with
means
at
hand
but
this
can
hardly
excite
surprise
in
us
who
know
the
antecedents
of
that
journal
under
another
name
the
absence
for
years
of
all
reserve
or
reverence
in
its
treatment
of
persons
or
of
things
deemed
sacred
its
grazing
over
the
very
edges
of
the
most
perilous
abysses
of
error
and
its
habitual
preferences
of
uncatholic
to
catholic
instincts
tendencies
and
motives
in
uttering
these
sad
thoughts
and
entreating
you
to
warn
your
people
and
especially
the
young
against
such
dangerous
leadership
believe
me
i
am
only
obeying
a
higher
direction
than
my
own
impulses
and
acting
under
much
more
solemn
sanctions
nor
shall
i
stand
alone
in
this
unhappily
necessary
correction
but
let
us
pass
to
more
cheerful
and
consoling
thoughts
if
my
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
address
from
my
having
held
though
unworthy
office
in
its
committee
enables
and
authorises
me
to
rebut
false
charges
against
it
it
has
further
bestowed
upon
me
the
privilege
of
personal
contact
with
a
body
of
men
who
justly
represented
the
entire
episcopate
and
would
have
represented
it
with
equal
advantage
in
any
other
period
of
the
church
i
know
not
who
selected
them
nor
do
i
venture
to
say
that
many
other
equal
committees
of
eighteen
could
not
have
been
extracted
from
the
remainder
i
think
they
might
but
i
must
say
that
a
singular
wisdom
seemed
to
me
to
have
presided
over
the
actual
whatever
might
have
been
any
other
possible
choice
deliberations
more
minute
more
mutually
respectful
more
courteous
or
at
the
same
time
more
straightforward
and
unflinching
could
hardly
have
been
carried
on
more
learning
in
theology
and
canon
law
more
deep
religious
feeling
a
graver
sense
of
the
responsibility
laid
upon
the
commission
or
a
more
scrupulous
regard
to
the
claims
of
justice
and
no
less
of
mercy
could
scarcely
have
been
exhibited
its
spirit
was
one
of
mildness
of
gentleness
and
of
reverence
to
all
who
rightly
claimed
it
violent
courses
invitations
to
draw
the
sword
and
rush
on
enemies
or
to
deal
about
the
major
excommunication
by
name
i
deliberately
assure
you
were
never
mentioned
never
insinuated
and
i
think
i
may
say
never
thought
of
by
any
one
in
that
council
in
the
sketches
proposed
by
several
there
was
not
a
harsh
or
disrespectful
word
about
any
sovereign
or
government
in
anything
i
ever
humbly
proposed
there
was
not
a
single
allusion
to
king
or
kaiser
our
duty
to
the
cardinal
and
our
duty
to
our
readers
alike
forbid
us
to
pass
by
these
remarks
without
notice
silence
would
imply
either
that
we
admitted
the
charge
or
that
we
disregarded
the
censure
and
each
of
these
suppositions
would
probably
be
welcome
to
the
enemies
of
our
common
cause
while
both
of
them
are
in
fact
untrue
the
impossibility
of
silence
however
involves
the
necessity
of
our
stating
the
facts
on
which
charges
so
definite
and
so
formidable
have
been
founded
in
doing
so
we
shall
endeavour
both
to
exhibit
the
true
sequence
of
events
and
to
explain
the
origin
of
the
cardinal
misapprehension
and
in
this
way
we
shall
reply
to
the
charges
made
against
us
but
we
must
first
explicitly
declare
as
we
have
already
implied
that
in
the
cardinal
support
and
approbation
of
our
work
we
should
recognise
an
aid
more
valuable
to
the
cause
we
are
engaged
in
than
the
utmost
support
which
could
be
afforded
to
us
by
any
other
person
and
that
we
can
not
consider
the
terms
he
has
used
respecting
us
otherwise
than
as
a
misfortune
to
be
profoundly
regretted
and
a
blow
which
might
seriously
impair
our
power
to
do
service
to
religion
a
catholic
review
which
is
deprived
of
the
countenance
of
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
is
placed
in
an
abnormal
position
a
germ
of
distrust
is
planted
in
the
ground
where
the
good
seed
should
grow
the
support
which
the
suspected
organ
endeavours
to
lend
to
the
church
is
repudiated
by
the
ecclesiastical
rulers
and
its
influence
in
protestant
society
as
an
expositor
of
catholic
ideas
is
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
because
its
exposition
of
them
may
be
declared
unsound
and
unfair
even
when
it
represents
them
most
faithfully
and
defends
them
most
successfully
the
most
devoted
efforts
of
its
conductors
are
liable
to
be
misconstrued
and
perversely
turned
either
against
the
church
or
against
the
itself
its
best
works
are
infected
with
the
suspicion
with
which
it
is
regarded
and
its
merits
become
almost
more
perilous
than
its
faults
these
considerations
could
not
have
been
overlooked
by
the
cardinal
when
he
resolved
to
take
a
step
which
threatened
to
paralyse
one
of
the
few
organs
of
catholic
opinion
in
england
yet
he
took
that
step
if
an
enemy
had
done
this
it
would
have
been
enough
to
vindicate
ourselves
and
to
leave
the
burden
of
an
unjust
accusation
to
be
borne
by
its
author
but
since
it
has
been
done
by
an
ecclesiastical
superior
with
entire
foresight
of
the
grave
consequences
of
the
act
it
has
become
necessary
for
us
in
addition
to
explain
the
circumstances
by
which
he
was
led
into
a
course
we
have
so
much
reason
to
deplore
and
to
show
how
an
erroneous
and
unjust
opinion
could
arise
in
the
mind
of
one
whom
obvious
motives
would
have
disposed
to
make
the
best
use
of
a
publication
the
conductors
of
which
are
labouring
to
serve
the
community
he
governs
and
desired
and
endeavoured
to
obtain
his
sanction
for
their
work
if
we
were
unable
to
reconcile
these
two
necessities
if
we
were
compelled
to
choose
between
a
forbearance
dishonourable
to
ourselves
and
a
refutation
injurious
to
the
cardinal
we
should
be
placed
in
a
painful
and
almost
inextricable
difficulty
for
a
catholic
who
defends
himself
at
the
expense
of
an
ecclesiastical
superior
sacrifices
that
which
is
generally
of
more
public
value
than
his
own
fair
fame
and
an
english
catholic
who
casts
back
on
cardinal
wiseman
the
blame
unjustly
thrown
on
himself
hurts
a
reputation
which
belongs
to
the
whole
body
and
disgraces
the
entire
community
of
catholics
by
such
a
course
a
review
which
exists
only
for
public
objects
would
stultify
its
own
position
and
injure
its
own
cause
and
home
and
foreign
has
no
object
to
attain
and
no
views
to
advance
except
objects
and
views
in
which
the
catholic
church
is
interested
the
ends
for
which
it
labours
according
to
its
light
and
ability
are
ends
by
which
the
church
can
not
but
gain
the
doctrine
it
receives
and
the
authority
it
obeys
are
none
other
than
those
which
command
the
acceptance
and
submission
of
the
cardinal
himself
it
desires
to
enjoy
his
support
it
has
no
end
to
gain
by
opposing
him
but
we
are
not
in
this
painful
dilemma
we
can
show
that
the
accusations
of
the
cardinal
are
unjust
and
at
the
same
time
we
can
explain
how
naturally
the
suppositions
on
which
they
are
founded
have
arisen
by
giving
a
distinct
and
ample
statement
of
our
own
principles
and
position
the
complaint
which
the
cardinal
makes
against
us
contains
substantially
five
charges
that
we
made
a
misstatement
affirming
something
historically
false
to
be
historically
true
that
the
falsehood
consists
in
the
statement
that
only
two
addresses
were
proposed
in
the
commission
one
violent
the
other
very
moderate
and
that
the
address
finally
adopted
was
a
compromise
between
these
two
that
we
insinuated
that
the
cardinal
himself
was
the
author
of
the
violent
address
that
we
cast
by
implication
a
severe
censure
on
that
address
and
its
author
and
that
our
narrative
was
derived
from
the
same
sources
and
inspired
by
the
same
motives
as
that
given
in
for
the
cardinal
distinctly
connects
the
two
accounts
and
quotes
passages
indifferently
from
both
in
such
a
way
that
words
which
we
never
used
might
by
a
superficial
reader
be
supposed
to
be
ours
to
these
charges
our
reply
is
as
follows
we
gave
the
statement
of
which
the
cardinal
complains
as
a
mere
rumour
current
on
any
good
authority
at
the
time
of
our
publication
and
we
employed
every
means
in
our
power
to
test
its
accuracy
though
the
only
other
narratives
which
had
then
reached
england
were
as
the
cardinal
says
too
partial
and
perverted
to
enable
us
to
sift
it
to
the
bottom
we
stated
that
a
rumour
was
current
not
that
its
purport
was
true
we
did
not
speak
of
only
two
addresses
actually
submitted
to
the
commission
we
supposed
the
report
to
mean
that
of
the
three
possible
forms
of
address
two
extreme
and
one
mean
each
of
which
actually
had
partisans
in
the
commission
the
middle
or
moderate
form
was
the
one
finally
adopted
we
had
no
suspicion
that
the
cardinal
had
proposed
any
violent
address
at
all
we
did
not
know
that
such
a
proposal
had
been
or
was
about
to
be
attributed
to
him
and
there
was
no
connection
whatever
between
him
and
it
either
in
our
mind
or
in
our
language
we
implied
no
censure
either
on
the
course
proposed
or
on
its
proposer
still
less
on
the
cardinal
personally
the
articles
in
first
appeared
and
that
in
france
some
days
after
our
review
was
in
the
hands
of
the
public
we
know
nothing
of
the
authority
on
which
their
statements
were
founded
and
we
have
not
the
least
sympathy
either
with
the
politics
or
the
motives
of
that
newspaper
this
reply
would
be
enough
for
our
own
defence
but
it
is
right
that
we
should
show
on
the
other
side
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
cardinal
was
led
to
subject
our
words
to
that
construction
which
we
have
so
much
reason
to
regret
reading
them
by
the
light
of
his
own
knowledge
and
through
the
medium
of
the
false
reports
which
afterwards
arose
with
regard
to
himself
his
interpretation
of
them
may
easily
have
appeared
both
plausible
and
likely
for
there
were
more
draft
addresses
than
one
one
was
his
the
actual
address
was
a
compromise
between
them
and
he
had
been
falsely
accused
of
and
severely
censured
for
proposing
violent
courses
in
his
address
knowing
this
he
was
tempted
to
suspect
a
covert
allusion
to
himself
under
our
words
and
the
chronological
relation
between
our
own
article
and
those
of
was
easily
forgotten
or
made
nugatory
by
the
supposition
of
their
both
being
derived
from
the
same
sources
of
information
but
this
will
be
made
clearer
by
the
following
narrative
of
facts
a
commission
was
appointed
to
draw
up
the
address
of
the
bishops
cardinal
wiseman
its
president
proposed
a
draft
address
which
was
not
obnoxious
to
any
of
the
criticisms
made
on
any
other
draft
and
is
in
substance
the
basis
of
the
address
as
it
was
ultimately
settled
it
was
favourably
received
by
the
commission
but
after
some
deliberation
its
final
adoption
was
postponed
subsequently
a
prelate
who
had
been
absent
from
the
previous
discussion
presented
another
draft
not
in
competition
with
that
proposed
by
the
president
nor
as
an
amendment
to
it
but
simply
as
a
basis
for
discussion
this
second
draft
was
also
favourably
received
and
the
commission
rather
out
of
consideration
for
the
great
services
and
reputation
of
its
author
than
from
any
dissatisfaction
with
the
address
proposed
by
the
president
resolved
to
amalgamate
the
two
drafts
all
other
projects
were
set
aside
and
in
particular
two
proposals
were
deliberately
rejected
one
of
these
proposals
was
to
pay
a
tribute
of
acknowledgment
for
the
services
of
the
french
nation
to
the
holy
see
the
other
was
to
denounce
the
perfidious
and
oppressive
policy
of
the
court
of
turin
in
terms
which
we
certainly
should
not
think
either
exaggerated
or
undeserved
we
have
neither
right
nor
inclination
to
complain
of
the
ardent
patriotism
which
has
been
exhibited
by
the
illustrious
bishop
of
orleans
in
the
two
publications
he
has
put
forth
since
his
return
to
his
see
or
of
the
indignation
which
the
system
prevailing
at
turin
must
excite
in
every
man
who
in
his
heart
loves
the
church
or
whose
intelligence
can
appreciate
the
first
principles
of
government
whatever
may
have
been
the
censure
proposed
it
certainly
did
not
surpass
the
measure
of
the
offence
nevertheless
the
impolicy
of
a
violent
course
which
could
not
fail
to
cause
irritation
and
to
aggravate
the
difficulties
of
the
church
appears
to
have
been
fully
recognised
by
the
commission
and
we
believe
that
no
one
was
more
prompt
in
exposing
the
inutility
of
such
a
measure
than
the
cardinal
himself
the
idea
that
anything
imprudent
or
aggressive
was
to
be
found
in
his
draft
is
contradicted
by
all
the
facts
of
the
case
and
has
not
a
shadow
of
foundation
in
anything
that
is
contained
in
the
address
as
adopted
we
need
say
no
more
to
explain
what
has
been
very
erroneously
called
our
covert
insinuation
from
this
narrative
of
facts
our
statement
comes
out
no
longer
as
a
mere
report
but
as
a
substantially
accurate
summary
of
events
questioned
only
on
one
point
the
extent
of
the
censure
which
was
proposed
so
that
in
the
account
which
the
cardinal
quoted
from
our
pages
there
was
no
substantial
statement
to
correct
as
in
fact
no
correction
of
any
definite
point
but
one
has
been
attempted
how
this
innocent
statement
has
come
to
be
suspected
of
a
hostile
intent
and
to
be
classed
with
the
calumnies
of
is
another
question
the
disposition
with
which
the
cardinal
sat
in
judgment
upon
our
words
was
founded
not
on
anything
they
contained
but
as
he
declares
on
the
antecedents
of
the
conductors
of
home
and
foreign
and
on
the
character
of
a
journal
which
no
longer
exists
that
character
he
declares
to
consist
in
the
absence
for
years
of
all
reserve
or
reverence
in
its
treatment
of
persons
or
of
things
deemed
sacred
its
grazing
over
the
very
edges
of
the
most
perilous
abysses
of
error
and
its
habitual
preferences
of
uncatholic
to
catholic
instincts
tendencies
and
motives
in
publishing
this
charge
which
amounts
to
a
declaration
that
we
hold
opinions
and
display
a
spirit
not
compatible
with
an
entire
attachment
and
submission
of
intellect
and
will
to
the
doctrine
and
authority
of
the
catholic
church
the
cardinal
adds
i
am
only
obeying
a
higher
direction
than
my
own
impulses
and
acting
under
much
more
solemn
sanctions
nor
shall
i
stand
alone
in
this
unhappily
necessary
correction
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
to
which
this
announcement
points
it
is
said
that
certain
papers
or
propositions
which
the
report
does
not
specify
have
been
extracted
from
the
journal
which
the
cardinal
identifies
with
this
review
and
forwarded
to
rome
for
examination
that
the
prefect
of
propaganda
has
characterised
these
extracts
or
some
of
them
in
terms
which
correspond
to
the
cardinal
language
and
that
the
english
bishops
have
deliberated
whether
they
should
issue
similar
declarations
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
majority
of
them
share
the
cardinal
view
which
is
also
that
of
a
large
portion
both
of
the
rest
of
the
clergy
and
also
of
the
laity
and
whatever
may
be
the
precise
action
which
has
been
taken
in
the
matter
it
is
unquestionable
that
a
very
formidable
mass
of
ecclesiastical
authority
and
popular
feeling
is
united
against
certain
principles
or
opinions
which
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
are
attributed
to
us
no
one
will
suppose
that
an
impression
so
general
can
be
entirely
founded
on
a
mistake
those
who
admit
the
bare
orthodoxy
of
our
doctrine
will
under
the
circumstances
naturally
conclude
that
in
our
way
of
holding
or
expounding
it
there
must
be
something
new
and
strange
unfamiliar
and
bewildering
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
prevalent
spirit
of
catholic
literature
something
which
our
are
not
prepared
to
admit
something
which
can
sufficiently
explain
misgivings
so
commonly
and
so
sincerely
entertained
others
may
perhaps
imagine
that
we
are
unconsciously
drifting
away
from
the
church
or
that
we
only
professedly
and
hypocritically
remain
with
her
but
the
catholic
critic
will
not
forget
that
charity
is
a
fruit
of
our
religion
and
that
his
anxiety
to
do
justice
to
those
from
whom
he
must
differ
ought
always
to
be
in
equal
proportion
with
his
zeal
relying
then
upon
this
spirit
of
fairness
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
the
opposition
we
encounter
and
in
order
that
there
may
remain
a
distinct
and
intelligible
record
of
the
aim
to
which
we
dedicate
our
labours
we
proceed
to
make
that
declaration
which
may
be
justly
asked
of
nameless
writers
as
a
testimony
of
the
purpose
which
has
inspired
our
undertaking
and
an
abiding
pledge
of
our
consistency
this
review
has
been
begun
on
a
foundation
which
its
conductors
can
never
abandon
without
treason
to
their
own
convictions
and
infidelity
to
the
objects
they
have
publicly
avowed
that
foundation
is
a
humble
faith
in
the
infallible
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
a
devotion
to
her
cause
which
controls
every
other
interest
and
an
attachment
to
her
authority
which
no
other
influence
can
supplant
if
in
anything
published
by
us
a
passage
can
be
found
which
is
contrary
to
that
doctrine
incompatible
with
that
devotion
or
disrespectful
to
that
authority
we
sincerely
retract
and
lament
it
no
such
passage
was
ever
consciously
admitted
into
the
pages
either
of
the
late
or
of
this
review
but
undoubtedly
we
may
have
committed
errors
in
judgment
and
admitted
errors
of
fact
such
mistakes
are
unavoidable
in
secular
matters
and
no
one
is
exempt
from
them
in
spiritual
things
except
by
the
constant
assistance
of
divine
grace
our
wish
and
purpose
are
not
to
deny
faults
but
to
repair
them
to
instruct
not
to
disturb
our
readers
to
take
down
the
barriers
which
shut
out
our
protestant
countrymen
from
the
church
not
to
raise
up
divisions
within
her
pale
and
to
confirm
and
deepen
not
to
weaken
alter
or
circumscribe
the
faith
of
catholics
the
most
exalted
methods
of
serving
religion
do
not
lie
in
the
path
of
a
periodical
which
addresses
a
general
audience
the
appliances
of
the
spiritual
life
belong
to
a
more
retired
sphere
that
of
the
priesthood
of
the
sacraments
of
religious
offices
that
of
prayer
meditation
and
they
are
profaned
by
exposure
and
choked
by
the
distractions
of
public
affairs
the
world
can
not
be
taken
into
the
confidence
of
our
inner
life
nor
can
the
discussion
of
ascetic
morality
be
complicated
with
the
secular
questions
of
the
day
to
make
the
attempt
would
be
to
usurp
and
degrade
a
holier
office
the
function
of
the
journalist
is
on
another
level
he
may
toil
in
the
same
service
but
not
in
the
same
rank
as
the
his
tools
are
coarser
his
method
less
refined
and
if
his
range
is
more
extended
his
influence
is
less
intense
literature
like
government
assists
religion
but
it
does
so
indirectly
and
from
without
the
ends
for
which
it
works
are
distinct
from
those
of
the
church
and
yet
subsidiary
to
them
and
the
more
independently
each
force
achieves
its
own
end
the
more
complete
will
the
ultimate
agreement
be
found
and
the
more
will
religion
profit
the
course
of
a
periodical
publication
in
its
relation
to
the
church
is
defined
by
this
distinction
of
ends
its
sphere
is
limited
by
the
difference
and
inferiority
of
the
means
which
it
employs
while
the
need
for
its
existence
and
its
independence
is
vindicated
by
the
necessity
there
is
for
the
service
it
performs
it
is
the
peculiar
mission
of
the
church
to
be
the
channel
of
grace
to
each
soul
by
her
spiritual
and
pastoral
action
she
alone
has
this
mission
but
it
is
not
her
only
work
she
has
also
to
govern
and
educate
so
far
as
government
and
education
are
needful
subsidiaries
to
her
great
work
of
the
salvation
of
souls
by
her
discipline
her
morality
her
law
she
strives
to
realise
the
divine
order
upon
earth
while
by
her
intellectual
labour
she
seeks
an
even
fuller
knowledge
of
the
works
the
ideas
and
the
nature
of
god
but
the
ethical
and
intellectual
offices
of
the
church
as
distinct
from
her
spiritual
office
are
not
hers
exclusively
or
peculiarly
they
were
discharged
however
imperfectly
before
she
was
founded
and
they
are
discharged
still
independently
of
her
by
two
other
authorities
science
and
society
the
church
can
not
perform
all
these
functions
by
herself
nor
consequently
can
she
absorb
their
direction
the
political
and
intellectual
orders
remain
permanently
distinct
from
the
spiritual
they
follow
their
own
ends
they
obey
their
own
laws
and
in
doing
so
they
support
the
cause
of
religion
by
the
discovery
of
truth
and
the
upholding
of
right
they
render
this
service
by
fulfilling
their
own
ends
independently
and
unrestrictedly
not
by
surrendering
them
for
the
sake
of
spiritual
interests
whatever
diverts
government
and
science
from
their
own
spheres
or
leads
religion
to
usurp
their
domains
confounds
distinct
authorities
and
imperils
not
only
political
right
and
scientific
truths
but
also
the
cause
of
faith
and
morals
a
government
that
for
the
interests
of
religion
disregards
political
right
and
a
science
that
for
the
sake
of
protecting
faith
wavers
and
dissembles
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
are
instruments
at
least
as
well
adapted
to
serve
the
cause
of
falsehood
as
to
combat
it
and
never
can
be
used
in
furtherance
of
the
truth
without
that
treachery
to
principle
which
is
a
sacrifice
too
costly
to
be
made
for
the
service
of
any
interest
whatever
again
the
principles
of
religion
government
and
science
are
in
harmony
always
and
absolutely
but
their
interests
are
not
and
though
all
other
interests
must
yield
to
those
of
religion
no
principle
can
succumb
to
any
interest
a
political
law
or
a
scientific
truth
may
be
perilous
to
the
morals
or
the
faith
of
individuals
but
it
can
not
on
this
ground
be
resisted
by
the
church
it
may
at
times
be
a
duty
of
the
state
to
protect
freedom
of
conscience
yet
this
freedom
may
be
a
temptation
to
apostasy
a
discovery
may
be
made
in
science
which
will
shake
the
faith
of
thousands
yet
religion
can
not
refute
it
or
object
to
it
the
difference
in
this
respect
between
a
true
and
a
false
religion
is
that
one
judges
all
things
by
the
standard
of
their
truth
the
other
by
the
touchstone
of
its
own
interests
a
false
religion
fears
the
progress
of
all
truth
a
true
religion
seeks
and
recognises
truth
wherever
it
can
be
found
and
claims
the
power
of
regulating
and
controlling
not
the
progress
but
the
dispensation
of
knowledge
the
church
both
accepts
the
truth
and
prepares
the
individual
to
receive
it
the
religious
world
has
been
long
divided
upon
this
great
question
do
we
find
principles
in
politics
and
in
science
are
their
methods
so
rigorous
that
we
may
not
bend
them
their
conclusions
so
certain
that
we
may
not
dissemble
them
in
presence
of
the
more
rigorous
necessity
of
the
salvation
of
souls
and
the
more
certain
truth
of
the
dogmas
of
faith
this
question
divides
protestants
into
rationalists
and
pietists
the
church
solves
it
in
practice
by
admitting
the
truths
and
the
principles
in
the
gross
and
by
dispensing
them
in
detail
as
men
can
bear
them
she
admits
the
certainty
of
the
mathematical
method
and
she
uses
the
historical
and
critical
method
in
establishing
the
documents
of
her
own
revelation
and
tradition
deny
this
method
and
her
recognised
arguments
are
destroyed
but
the
church
can
not
and
will
not
deny
the
validity
of
the
methods
upon
which
she
is
obliged
to
depend
not
indeed
for
her
existence
but
for
her
demonstration
there
is
no
opening
for
catholics
to
deny
in
the
gross
that
political
science
may
have
absolute
principles
of
right
or
intellectual
science
of
truth
during
the
last
hundred
years
catholic
literature
has
passed
through
three
phases
in
relation
to
this
question
at
one
time
when
absolutism
and
infidelity
were
in
the
ascendant
and
the
church
was
oppressed
by
governments
and
reviled
by
the
people
catholic
writers
imitated
and
even
caricatured
the
early
christian
apologists
in
endeavouring
to
represent
their
system
in
the
light
most
acceptable
to
one
side
or
the
other
to
disguise
antagonism
to
modify
old
claims
and
to
display
only
that
side
of
their
religion
which
was
likely
to
attract
toleration
and
good
will
nothing
which
could
give
offence
was
allowed
to
appear
something
of
the
fulness
if
not
of
the
truth
of
religion
was
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
conciliation
the
great
catholic
revival
of
the
present
century
gave
birth
to
an
opposite
school
the
attitude
of
timidity
and
concession
was
succeeded
by
one
of
confidence
and
triumph
conciliation
passed
into
defiance
the
unscrupulous
falsehoods
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
thrown
suspicion
on
all
that
had
ever
been
advanced
by
the
adversaries
of
religion
and
the
belief
that
nothing
could
be
said
for
the
church
gradually
died
away
into
the
conviction
that
nothing
which
was
said
against
her
could
be
true
a
school
of
writers
arose
strongly
imbued
with
a
horror
of
the
calumnies
of
infidel
philosophers
and
hostile
controversialists
and
animated
by
a
sovereign
desire
to
revive
and
fortify
the
spirit
of
catholics
they
became
literary
advocates
their
only
object
was
to
accomplish
the
great
work
before
them
and
they
were
often
careless
in
statement
rhetorical
and
illogical
in
argument
too
positive
to
be
critical
and
too
confident
to
be
precise
in
this
school
the
present
generation
of
catholics
was
educated
to
it
they
owe
the
ardour
of
their
zeal
the
steadfastness
of
their
faith
and
their
catholic
views
of
history
politics
and
literature
the
services
of
these
writers
have
been
very
great
they
restored
the
balance
which
was
leaning
terribly
against
religion
both
in
politics
and
letters
they
created
a
catholic
opinion
and
a
great
catholic
literature
and
they
conquered
for
the
church
a
very
powerful
influence
in
european
thought
the
word
ultramontane
was
revived
to
designate
this
school
and
that
restricted
term
was
made
to
embrace
men
as
different
as
de
maistre
and
bonald
lamennais
and
montalembert
balmez
and
donoso
cortes
stolberg
and
schlegel
phillips
and
tapparelli
there
are
two
peculiarities
by
which
we
may
test
this
whole
group
of
eminent
writers
their
identification
of
catholicism
with
some
secular
cause
such
as
the
interests
of
a
particular
political
or
philosophical
system
and
the
use
they
make
of
protestant
authorities
the
views
which
they
endeavoured
to
identify
with
the
cause
of
the
church
however
various
agreed
in
giving
them
the
air
of
partisans
like
advocates
they
were
wont
to
defend
their
cause
with
the
ingenuity
of
those
who
know
that
all
points
are
not
equally
strong
and
that
nothing
can
be
conceded
except
what
they
can
defend
they
did
much
for
the
cause
of
learning
though
they
took
little
interest
in
what
did
not
immediately
serve
their
turn
in
their
use
of
protestant
writers
they
displayed
the
same
partiality
they
estimated
a
religious
adversary
not
by
his
knowledge
but
by
his
concessions
and
they
took
advantage
of
the
progress
of
historical
criticism
not
to
revise
their
opinions
but
to
obtain
testimony
to
their
truth
it
was
characteristic
of
the
school
to
be
eager
in
citing
the
favourable
passages
from
protestant
authors
and
to
be
careless
of
those
which
were
less
serviceable
for
discussion
in
the
principal
writers
this
tendency
was
counteracted
by
character
and
learning
but
in
the
hands
of
men
less
competent
or
less
suspicious
of
themselves
sore
pressed
by
the
necessities
of
controversy
and
too
obscure
to
challenge
critical
correction
the
method
became
a
snare
for
both
the
writer
and
his
readers
thus
the
very
qualities
which
we
condemn
in
our
opponents
as
the
natural
defences
of
error
and
the
significant
emblems
of
a
bad
cause
came
to
taint
both
our
literature
and
our
policy
learning
has
passed
on
beyond
the
range
of
these
men
vision
their
greatest
strength
was
in
the
weakness
of
their
adversaries
and
their
own
faults
were
eclipsed
by
the
monstrous
errors
against
which
they
fought
but
scientific
methods
have
now
been
so
perfected
and
have
come
to
be
applied
in
so
cautious
and
so
fair
a
spirit
that
the
apologists
of
the
last
generation
have
collapsed
before
them
investigations
have
become
so
impersonal
so
colourless
so
free
from
the
prepossessions
which
distort
truth
from
predetermined
aims
and
foregone
conclusions
that
their
results
can
only
be
met
by
investigations
in
which
the
same
methods
are
yet
more
completely
and
conscientiously
applied
the
sounder
scholar
is
invincible
by
the
brilliant
rhetorician
and
the
eloquence
and
ingenuity
of
de
maistre
and
schlegel
would
be
of
no
avail
against
researches
pursued
with
perfect
mastery
of
science
and
singleness
of
purpose
the
apologist
armour
would
be
vulnerable
at
the
point
where
his
religion
and
his
science
were
forced
into
artificial
union
again
as
science
widens
and
deepens
it
escapes
from
the
grasp
of
dilettantism
such
knowledge
as
existed
formerly
could
be
borrowed
or
superficially
acquired
by
men
whose
lives
were
not
devoted
to
its
pursuit
and
subjects
as
far
apart
as
the
controversies
of
scripture
history
and
physical
science
might
be
respectably
discussed
by
a
single
writer
no
such
shallow
versatility
is
possible
now
the
new
accuracy
and
certainty
of
criticism
have
made
science
unattainable
except
by
those
who
devote
themselves
systematically
to
its
study
the
training
of
a
skilled
labourer
has
become
indispensable
for
the
scholar
and
science
yields
its
results
to
none
but
those
who
have
mastered
its
methods
herein
consists
the
distinction
between
the
apologists
we
have
described
and
that
school
of
writers
and
thinkers
which
is
now
growing
up
in
foreign
countries
and
on
the
triumph
of
which
the
position
of
the
church
in
modern
society
depends
while
she
was
surrounded
with
men
whose
learning
was
sold
to
the
service
of
untruth
her
defenders
naturally
adopted
the
artifices
of
the
advocate
and
wrote
as
if
they
were
pleading
for
a
human
cause
it
was
their
concern
only
to
promote
those
precise
kinds
and
portions
of
knowledge
which
would
confound
an
adversary
or
support
a
claim
but
learning
ceased
to
be
hostile
to
christianity
when
it
ceased
to
be
pursued
merely
as
an
instrument
of
controversy
when
facts
came
to
be
acknowledged
no
longer
because
they
were
useful
but
simply
because
they
were
true
religion
had
no
occasion
to
rectify
the
results
of
learning
when
irreligion
had
ceased
to
pervert
them
and
the
old
weapons
of
controversy
became
repulsive
as
soon
as
they
had
ceased
to
be
useful
by
this
means
the
authority
of
political
right
and
of
scientific
truth
has
been
and
they
have
become
not
tools
to
be
used
by
religion
for
her
own
interests
but
conditions
which
she
must
observe
in
her
actions
and
arguments
within
their
respective
spheres
politics
can
determine
what
rights
are
just
science
what
truths
are
certain
there
are
few
political
or
scientific
problems
which
affect
the
doctrines
of
religion
and
none
of
them
are
hostile
to
it
in
their
solution
but
this
is
not
the
difficulty
which
is
usually
felt
a
political
principle
or
a
scientific
discovery
is
more
commonly
judged
not
by
its
relation
to
religious
truth
but
by
its
bearings
on
some
manifest
or
probable
religious
interests
a
fact
may
be
true
or
a
law
may
be
just
and
yet
it
may
under
certain
conditions
involve
some
spiritual
loss
and
here
is
the
touchstone
and
the
watershed
of
principles
some
men
argue
that
the
object
of
government
is
to
contribute
to
the
salvation
of
souls
that
certain
measures
may
imperil
this
end
and
that
therefore
they
must
be
condemned
these
men
only
look
to
interests
they
can
not
conceive
the
duty
of
sacrificing
them
to
independent
political
principle
or
idea
or
again
they
will
say
here
is
a
scientific
discovery
calculated
to
overthrow
many
traditionary
ideas
to
undo
a
prevailing
system
of
theology
to
disprove
a
current
interpretation
to
cast
discredit
on
eminent
authorities
to
compel
men
to
revise
their
most
settled
opinions
to
disturb
the
foundation
on
which
the
faith
of
others
stands
these
are
sufficient
reasons
for
care
in
the
dispensation
of
truth
but
the
men
we
are
describing
will
go
on
to
say
this
is
enough
to
throw
suspicion
on
the
discovery
itself
even
if
it
is
true
its
danger
is
greater
than
its
value
let
it
therefore
be
carefully
buried
and
let
all
traces
of
it
be
swept
away
a
policy
like
this
appears
to
us
both
wrong
in
itself
and
derogatory
to
the
cause
it
is
employed
to
serve
it
argues
either
a
timid
faith
which
fears
the
light
or
a
false
morality
which
would
do
evil
that
good
might
come
how
often
have
catholics
involved
themselves
in
hopeless
contradiction
sacrificed
principle
to
opportunity
adapted
their
theories
to
their
interests
and
staggered
the
world
reliance
on
their
sincerity
by
subterfuges
which
entangle
the
church
in
the
shifting
sands
of
party
warfare
instead
of
establishing
her
cause
on
the
solid
rock
of
principles
how
often
have
they
clung
to
some
plausible
chimera
which
seemed
to
serve
their
cause
and
nursed
an
artificial
ignorance
where
they
feared
the
discoveries
of
an
impertinent
curiosity
as
ingenious
in
detraction
as
in
silence
and
dissimulation
have
they
not
too
often
answered
imputations
which
they
could
not
disprove
with
accusations
which
they
could
not
prove
till
the
slanders
they
had
invented
rivalled
in
number
and
intensity
the
slanders
which
had
been
invented
against
them
for
such
men
principles
have
had
only
temporary
value
and
local
currency
whatever
force
was
the
strongest
in
any
place
and
at
any
time
with
that
they
have
sought
to
ally
the
cause
of
religion
they
have
with
equal
zeal
identified
her
with
freedom
in
one
country
and
with
absolutism
in
another
with
conservatism
where
she
had
privileges
to
keep
and
with
reform
where
she
had
oppression
to
withstand
and
for
all
this
what
have
they
gained
they
have
betrayed
duties
more
sacred
than
the
privileges
for
which
they
fought
they
have
lied
before
god
and
man
they
have
been
divided
into
fractions
by
the
supposed
interests
of
the
church
when
they
ought
to
have
been
united
by
her
principles
and
her
doctrines
and
against
themselves
they
have
justified
those
grave
accusations
of
falsehood
insincerity
indifference
to
civil
rights
and
contempt
for
civil
authorities
which
are
uttered
with
such
profound
injustice
against
the
church
the
present
difficulties
of
the
church
her
internal
dissensions
and
apparent
weakness
the
alienation
of
so
much
intellect
the
strong
prejudice
which
keeps
many
away
from
her
altogether
and
makes
many
who
had
approached
her
shrink
back
all
draw
nourishment
from
this
rank
soil
the
antagonism
of
hostile
doctrines
and
the
enmity
of
governments
count
for
little
in
comparison
it
is
in
vain
to
point
to
her
apostolic
tradition
the
unbroken
unity
of
her
doctrine
her
missionary
energy
or
her
triumphs
in
the
region
of
spiritual
life
if
we
fail
to
remove
the
accumulated
prejudice
which
generations
of
her
advocates
have
thrown
up
around
her
the
world
can
never
know
and
recognise
her
divine
perfection
while
the
pleas
of
her
defenders
are
scarcely
nearer
to
the
truth
than
the
crimes
which
her
enemies
impute
to
her
how
can
the
stranger
understand
where
the
children
of
the
kingdom
are
deceived
against
this
policy
a
firm
and
unyielding
stand
is
of
supreme
necessity
the
evil
is
curable
and
the
loss
recoverable
by
a
conscientious
adherence
to
higher
principles
and
a
patient
pursuit
of
truth
and
right
political
science
can
place
the
liberty
of
the

on
principles
so
certain
and
unfailing
that
intelligent
and
disinterested
protestants
will
accept
them
and
in
every
branch
of
learning
with
which
religion
is
in
any
way
connected
the
progressive
discovery
of
truth
will
strengthen
faith
by
promoting
knowledge
and
correcting
opinion
while
it
destroys
prejudices
and
superstitions
by
dissipating
the
errors
on
which
they
are
founded
this
is
a
course
which
conscience
must
approve
in
the
whole
though
against
each
particular
step
of
it
conscience
may
itself
be
tempted
to
revolt
it
does
not
always
conduce
to
immediate
advantage
it
may
lead
across
dangerous
and
scandalous
ground
a
rightful
sovereign
may
exclude
the
church
from
his
dominions
or
persecute
her
members
is
she
therefore
to
say
that
his
right
is
no
right
or
that
all
intolerance
is
necessarily
wrong
a
newly
discovered
truth
may
be
a
to
perplex
or
to
alienate
the
minds
of
men
is
she
therefore
to
deny
or
smother
it
by
no
means
she
must
in
every
case
do
right
she
must
prefer
the
law
of
her
own
general
spirit
to
the
exigencies
of
immediate
external
occasion
and
leave
the
issue
in
the
hands
of
god
such
is
the
substance
of
those
principles
which
shut
out
home
and
foreign
from
the
sympathies
of
a
large
portion
of
the
body
to
which
we
belong
in
common
with
no
small
or
insignificant
section
of
our
we
hold
that
the
time
has
gone
by
when
defects
in
political
or
scientific
education
could
be
alleged
as
an
excuse
for
depending
upon
expediency
or
mistrusting
knowledge
and
that
the
moment
has
come
when
the
best
service
that
can
be
done
to
religion
is
to
be
faithful
to
principle
to
uphold
the
right
in
politics
though
it
should
require
an
apparent
sacrifice
and
to
seek
truth
in
science
though
it
should
involve
a
possible
risk
modern
society
has
developed
no
security
for
freedom
no
instrument
of
progress
no
means
of
arriving
at
truth
which
we
look
upon
with
indifference
or
suspicion
we
see
no
necessary
gulf
to
separate
our
political
or
scientific
convictions
from
those
of
the
wisest
and
most
intelligent
men
who
may
differ
from
us
in
religion
in
pursuing
those
studies
in
which
they
can
sympathise
starting
from
principles
which
they
can
accept
and
using
methods
which
are
theirs
as
well
as
ours
we
shall
best
attain
the
objects
which
alone
can
be
aimed
at
in
a
review
our
own
instruction
and
the
conciliation
of
opponents
there
are
two
main
considerations
by
which
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
be
guided
in
our
pursuit
of
these
objects
first
we
have
to
remember
that
the
scientific
method
is
most
clearly
exhibited
and
recognised
in
connection
with
subjects
about
which
there
are
no
prepossessions
to
wound
no
fears
to
excite
no
interests
to
threaten
hence
not
only
do
we
exclude
from
our
range
all
that
concerns
the
ascetic
life
and
the
more
intimate
relations
of
religion
but
we
most
willingly
devote
ourselves
to
the
treatment
of
subjects
quite
remote
from
all
religious
bearing
secondly
we
have
to
remember
that
the
internal
government
of
the
church
belongs
to
a
sphere
exclusively
ecclesiastical
from
the
discussion
of
which
we
are
shut
out
not
only
by
motives
of
propriety
and
reverence
but
also
by
the
necessary
absence
of
any
means
for
forming
a
judgment
so
much
ground
is
fenced
off
by
these
two
considerations
that
a
secular
sphere
alone
remains
the
character
of
a
scientific
review
is
determined
for
it
it
can
not
enter
on
the
domains
of
ecclesiastical
government
or
of
faith
and
neither
of
them
can
possibly
be
affected
by
its
conclusions
or
its
mode
of
discussion
in
asserting
thus
absolutely
that
all
truth
must
render
service
to
religion
we
are
saying
what
few
perhaps
will
deny
in
the
abstract
but
what
many
are
not
prepared
to
admit
in
detail
it
will
be
vaguely
felt
that
views
which
take
so
little
account
of
present
inconvenience
and
manifest
danger
are
perilous
and
novel
though
they
may
seem
to
spring
from
a
more
unquestioning
faith
a
more
absolute
confidence
in
truth
and
a
more
perfect
submission
to
the
general
laws
of
morality
there
is
no
articulate
theory
and
no
distinct
view
but
there
is
long
habit
and
there
are
strong
inducements
of
another
kind
which
support
this
sentiment
to
understand
the
certainty
of
scientific
truth
a
man
must
have
deeply
studied
scientific
method
to
understand
the
obligation
of
political
principle
requires
a
similar
mental
discipline
a
man
who
is
suddenly
introduced
from
without
into
a
society
where
this
certainty
and
obligation
are
currently
acknowledged
is
naturally
bewildered
he
can
not
distinguish
between
the
dubious
impressions
of
his
knowledge
and
the
certainty
of
that
primary
direct
information
which
those
who
possess
it
have
no
power
to
deny
to
accept
a
criterion
which
may
condemn
some
cherished
opinion
has
hitherto
seemed
to
him
a
mean
surrender
and
a
sacrifice
of
position
he
feels
it
simple
loss
to
give
up
an
idea
and
even
if
he
is
prepared
to
surrender
it
when
compelled
by
controversy
still
he
thinks
it
quite
unnecessary
and
gratuitous
to
engage
voluntarily
in
researches
which
may
lead
to
such
an
issue
to
enter
thus
upon
the
discussion
of
questions
which
have
been
mixed
up
with
religion
and
made
to
contribute
their
support
to
piety
seems
to
the
idle
spectator
or
to
the
person
who
is
absorbed
in
defending
religion
a
mere
useless
and
troublesome
meddling
dictated
by
the
pride
of
intellectual
triumph
or
by
the
moral
cowardice
which
seeks
unworthily
to
propitiate
enemies
great
consideration
is
due
to
those
whose
minds
are
not
prepared
for
the
full
light
of
truth
and
the
grave
responsibilities
of
knowledge
who
have
not
learned
to
distinguish
what
is
divine
from
what
is
human
defined
dogma
from
the
atmosphere
of
opinion
which
surrounds
it
and
who
honour
both
with
the
same
awful
reverence
great
allowances
are
also
due
to
those
who
are
constantly
labouring
to
nourish
the
spark
of
belief
in
minds
perplexed
by
difficulties
or
darkened
by
ignorance
and
prejudice
these
men
have
not
always
the
results
of
research
at
command
they
have
no
time
to
keep
abreast
with
the
constant
progress
of
historical
and
critical
science
and
the
solutions
which
they
are
obliged
to
give
are
consequently
often
imperfect
and
adapted
only
to
uninstructed
and
uncultivated
minds
their
reasoning
can
not
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
scholar
who
has
to
meet
error
in
its
most
vigorous
refined
and
ingenious
form
as
knowledge
advances
it
must
inevitably
happen
that
they
will
find
some
of
their
hitherto
accepted
facts
contradicted
and
some
arguments
overturned
which
have
done
good
service
they
will
find
that
some
statements
which
they
have
adopted
under
stress
of
controversy
to
remove
prejudice
and
doubt
turn
out
to
be
hasty
and
partial
replies
to
the
questions
they
were
meant
to
answer
and
that
the
true
solutions
would
require
more
copious
explanation
than
they
can
give
and
thus
will
be
brought
home
to
their
minds
that
in
the
topics
upon
which
popular
controversy
chiefly
turns
the
conditions
of
discussion
and
the
resources
of
arguments
are
subject
to
gradual
and
constant
change
a
review
therefore
which
undertakes
to
investigate
political
and
scientific
problems
without
any
direct
subservience
to
the
interests
of
a
party
or
a
cause
but
with
the
belief
that
such
investigation
by
its
very
independence
and
straightforwardness
must
give
the
most
valuable
indirect
assistance
to
religion
can
not
expect
to
enjoy
at
once
the
favour
of
those
who
have
grown
up
in
another
school
of
ideas
men
who
are
occupied
in
the
special
functions
of
ecclesiastical
life
where
the
church
is
and
requires
no
extraneous
aid
will
naturally
see
at
first
in
the
problems
of
public
life
the
demands
of
modern
society
and
the
progress
of
human
learning
nothing
but
new
and
unwelcome
difficulties
trial
and
distraction
to
themselves
temptation
and
danger
to
their
flocks
in
time
they
will
learn
that
there
is
a
higher
and
a
nobler
course
for
catholics
than
one
which
begins
in
fear
and
does
not
lead
to
security
they
will
come
to
see
how
vast
a
service
they
may
render
to
the
church
by
vindicating
for
themselves
a
place
in
every
movement
that
promotes
the
study
of
god
works
and
the
advancement
of
mankind
they
will
remember
that
while
the
office
of
ecclesiastical
authority
is
to
tolerate
to
warn
and
to
guide
that
of
religious
intelligence
and
zeal
is
not
to
leave
the
great
work
of
intellectual
and
social
civilisation
to
be
the
monopoly
and
privilege
of
others
but
to
save
it
from
debasement
by
giving
to
it
for
leaders
the
children
not
the
enemies
of
the

at

none
have
had

with

have
led
men
to
dispute
the
competence

the

of

rare
as
such
conflicts
have
been
they
have
awakened
a
special
hostility
which
the
defenders
of
catholicism
have
not
succeeded
in
allaying
they
have
induced
a
suspicion
that
the
church
in
her
zeal
for
the
prevention
of
error
represses
that
intellectual
freedom
which
is
essential
to
the
progress
of
truth
that
she
allows
an
administrative
interference
with
convictions
to
which
she
can
not
attach
the
stigma
of
falsehood
and
that
she
claims
a
right
to
restrain
the
growth
of
knowledge
to
justify
an
acquiescence
in

promote

these
particular
accusations
are
founded

dishonest
controversy
loves
to
confound
the
personal
with
the
spiritual
element
in
the
church
to
ignore
the
distinction
between
the
sinful
agents
and
the
divine
institution
and
this
confusion
makes
it
easy
to
deny
what
otherwise
would
be
too
evident
to
question
that
knowledge
has
a
freedom
in
the
catholic
church
which
it
can
find
in
no
other
religion
though
there
as
elsewhere
freedom
degenerates
unless
it
has
to
struggle
in
its
own
defence
nothing
can
better
illustrate
this
truth
than
the
actual
course
of
events
in
the
cases
of
lamennais
and
frohschammer
they
are
two
of
the
most
conspicuous
instances
in
point
and
they
exemplify
the
opposite
mistakes
through
which
a
haze
of
obscurity
has
gathered
over
the
true
notions
of
authority
and
freedom
in
the
church
the
correspondence
of
lamennais
and
the
later
writings
of
frohschammer
furnish
a
revelation
which
ought
to
warn
all
those
who
through
ignorance
or
timidity
or
weakness
of
faith
are
tempted
to
despair
of
the
reconciliation
between
science
and
religion
and
to
acquiesce
either
in
the
subordination
of
one
to
the
other
or
in
their
complete
separation
and
estrangement
of
these
alternatives
lamennais
chose
the
first
frohschammer
the
second
and
the
exaggeration
of
the
claims
of
authority
by
the
one
and
the
extreme
assertion
of
independence
by
the
other
have
led
them
by
contrary
paths
to
nearly
the
same
end
when
lamennais
surveyed
the
fluctuations
of
science
the
multitude
of
opinions
the
confusion
and
conflict
of
theories
he
was
led
to
doubt
the
efficacy
of
all
human
tests
of
truth
science
seemed
to
him
essentially
tainted
with
hopeless
uncertainty
in
his
ignorance
of
its
methods
he
fancied
them
incapable
of
attaining
to
anything
more
than
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
probability
and
powerless
to
afford
a
strict
demonstration
or
to
distinguish
the
deposit
of
real
knowledge
amidst
the
turbid
current
of
opinion
he
refused
to
admit
that
there
is
a
sphere
within
which
metaphysical
philosophy
speaks
with
absolute
certainty
or
that
the
landmarks
set
up
by
history
and
natural
science
may
be
such
as
neither
authority
nor
prescription
neither
the
doctrine
of
the
schools
nor
the
interest
of
the
church
has
the
power
to
disturb
or
the
right
to
evade
these
sciences
presented
to
his
eyes
a
chaos
incapable
of
falling
into
order
and
harmony
by
any
internal
and
requiring
the
action
of
an
external
director
to
clear
up
its
darkness
and
remove
its
uncertainty
he
thought
that
no
research
however
rigorous
could
make
sure
of
any
fragment
of
knowledge
worthy
the
name
he
admitted
no
certainty
but
that
which
relied
on
the
general
tradition
of
mankind
recorded
and
sanctioned
by
the
infallible
judgment
of
the
holy
see
he
would
have
all
power
committed
and
every
question
referred
to
that
supreme
and
universal
authority
by
its
means
he
would
supply
all
the
gaps
in
the
horizon
of
the
human
intellect
settle
every
controversy
solve
the
problems
of
science
and
regulate
the
policy
of
states
the
extreme
ultramontanism
which
seeks
the
safeguard
of
faith
in
the
absolutism
of
rome
he
believed
to
be
the
keystone
of
the
catholic
system
in
his
eyes
all
who
rejected
it
the
jesuits
among
them
were
gallicans
and
gallicanism
was
the
corruption
of
the
christian
idea
if
my
principles
are
rejected
he
wrote
on
the
of
november
i
see
no
means
of
defending
religion
effectually
no
decisive
answer
to
the
objections
of
the
unbelievers
of
our
time
how
could
these
principles
be
favourable
to
them
they
are
simply
the
development
of
the
great
catholic
maxim
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
joubert
said
of
him
with
perfect
justice
that
when
he
destroyed
all
the
bases
of
human
certainty
in
order
to
retain
no
foundation
but
authority
he
destroyed
authority
itself
the
confidence
which
led
him
to
confound
the
human
element
with
the
divine
in
the
holy
see
was
destined
to
be
tried
by
the
severest
of
all
tests
and
his
exaggeration
of
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
proved
fatal
to
his
religious
faith
in
the
roman
breviary
was
not
to
be
bought
in
paris
we
may
hence
measure
the
amount
of
opposition
with
which
lamennais
endeavours
to
exalt
rome
would
be
met
by
the
majority
of
the
french
bishops
and
clergy
and
by
the
school
of
sulpice
for
him
on
the
other
hand
no
terms
were
too
strong
to
express
his
animosity
against
those
who
rejected
his
teaching
and
thwarted
his
designs
the
bishops
he
railed
at
as
idiotic
devotees
incredibly
blind
supernaturally
foolish
the
jesuits
he
said
were
de
la
and
united
imbecility
with
the
vilest
passions
he
fancied
that
in
many
dioceses
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
religion
that
a
schism
was
at
hand
and
that
the
resistance
of
the
clergy
to
his
principles
threatened
to
destroy
catholicism
in
france
rome
he
was
sure
would
help
him
in
his
struggle
against
her
faithless
assailants
on
behalf
of
her
authority
and
in
his
endeavour
to
make
the
clergy
refer
their
disputes
to
her
so
as
to
receive
from
the
pope
mouth
the
infallible
oracles
of
eternal
truth
whatever
the
pope
might
decide
would
he
said
be
right
for
the
pope
alone
was
infallible
bishops
might
be
sometimes
resisted
but
the
pope
never
it
was
both
absurd
and
blasphemous
even
to
advise
him
i
have
read
in
the
di

said
the
advice
of
de
chateaubriand
to
the
holy
ghost
at
any
rate
the
holy
ghost
is
fully
warned
and
if
he
makes
a
mistake
this
time
it
will
not
be
the
ambassador
fault
three
popes
passed
away
and
still
nothing
was
done
against
the
traitors
he
was
for
ever
denouncing
this
reserve
astounded
him
was
rome
herself
tainted
with
gallicanism
and
in
league
with
those
who
had
conspired
for
her
destruction
what
but
a
schism
could
ensue
from
this
inexplicable
apathy
the
silence
was
a
grievous
trial
to
his
faith
let
us
shut
our
eyes
he
said
let
us
invoke
the
holy
spirit
let
us
collect
all
the
powers
of
our
soul
that
our
faith
may
not
be
shaken
in
his
perplexity
he
began
to
make
distinctions
between
the
pope
and
the
roman
court
the
advisers
of
the
pope
were
traitors
dwellers
in
the
outer
darkness
blind
and
deaf
the
pope
himself
and
he
alone
was
infallible
and
would
never
act
so
as
to
injure
the
faith
though
meanwhile
he
was
not
aware
of
the
real
state
of
things
and
was
evidently
deceived
by
false
reports
a
few
months
later
came
the
necessity
for
a
further
distinction
between
the
pontiff
and
the
sovereign
if
the
doctrines
of
the
had
caused
displeasure
at
rome
it
was
only
on
political
grounds
if
the
pope
was
offended
he
was
offended
not
as
vicar
of
christ
but
as
a
temporal
monarch
implicated
in
the
political
system
of
europe
in
his
capacity
of
spiritual
head
of
the
church
he
could
not
condemn
writers
for
sacrificing
all
human
and
political
considerations
to
the
supreme
interests
of
the
church
but
must
in
reality
agree
with
them
as
the
polish
revolution
brought
the
political
questions
into
greater
prominence
lamennais
became
more
and
more
convinced
of
the
wickedness
of
those
who
surrounded
gregory
and
of
the
political
incompetence
of
the
pope
himself
he
described
him
as
weeping
and
praying
motionless
amidst
the
darkness
which
the
ambitious
corrupt
and
frantic
idiots
around
him
were
ever
striving
to
thicken
still
he
felt
secure
when
the
foundations
of
the
church
were
threatened
when
an
essential
doctrine
was
at
stake
though
for
the
first
time
in
eighteen
centuries
the
supreme
authority
might
refuse
to
speak
at
least
it
could
not
speak
out
against
the
truth
in
this
belief
he
made
his
last
journey
to
rome
then
came
his
condemnation
the
staff
on
which
he
leaned
with
all
his
weight
broke
in
his
hands
the
authority
he
had
so
grossly
exaggerated
turned
against
him
and
his
faith
was
left
without
support
his
system
supplied
no
resource
for
such
an
emergency
he
submitted
not
because
he
was
in
error
but
because
catholics
had
no
right
to
defend
the
church
against
the
supreme
will
even
of
an
erring
pontiff
he
was
persuaded
that
his
silence
would
injure
religion
yet
he
deemed
it
his
duty
to
be
silent
and
to
abandon
theology
he
had
ceased
to
believe
that
the
pope
could
not
err
but
he
still
believed
that
he
could
not
lawfully
be
disobeyed
in
the
two
years
during
which
he
still
remained
in
the
church
his
faith
in
her
system
fell
rapidly
to
pieces
within
two
months
after
the
publication
of
the
encyclical
he
wrote
that
the
pope
like
the
other
princes
seemed
careful
not
to
omit
any
blunder
that
could
secure
his
annihilation
three
weeks
afterwards
he
denounced
in
the
fiercest
terms
the
corruption
of
rome
he
predicted
that
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
was
about
to
depart
with
the
old
monarchies
and
though
the
church
could
not
die
he
would
not
undertake
to
say
that
she
would
revive
in
her
old
forms
the
pope
he
said
had
so
zealously
embraced
the
cause
of
antichristian
despotism
as
to
sacrifice
to
it
the
religion
of
which
he
was
the
chief
he
no
longer
felt
it
possible
to
distinguish
what
was
immutable
in
the
external
organisation
of
the
church
he
admitted
the
personal
fallibility
of
the
pope
and
declared
that
though
it
was
impossible
without
rome
to
defend
catholicism
successfully
yet
nothing
could
be
hoped
for
from
her
and
that
she
seemed
to
have
condemned
catholicism
to
die
the
pope
he
soon
afterwards
said
was
in
league
with
the
kings
in
opposition
to
the
eternal
truths
of
religion
the
hierarchy
was
out
of
court
and
a
transformation
like
that
from
which
the
church
and
papacy
had
sprung
was
about
to
bring
them
both
to
an
end
after
eighteen
centuries
in
gregory
xvi
before
the
following
year
was
over
he
had
ceased
to
be
in
communion
with
the
catholic
church
the
fall
of
lamennais
however
impressive
as
a
warning
is
of
no
great
historical
importance
for
he
carried
no
one
with
him
and
his
favourite
disciples
became
the
ablest
defenders
of
catholicism
in
france
but
it
exemplifies
one
of
the
natural
consequences
of
dissociating
secular
from
religious
truth
and
denying
that
they
hold
in
solution
all
the
elements
necessary
for
their
reconciliation
and
union
in
more
recent
times
the
same
error
has
led
by
a
contrary
path
to
still
more
lamentable
results
and
scepticism
on
the
possibility
of
harmonising
reason
and
faith
has
once
more
driven
a
philosopher
into
heresy
between
the
fall
of
lamennais
and
the
conflict
with
frohschammer
many
metaphysical
writers
among
the
catholic
clergy
had
incurred
the
censures
of
rome
it
is
enough
to
cite
bautain
in
france
rosmini
in
italy
and
günther
in
austria
but
in
these
cases
no
scandal
ensued
and
the
decrees
were
received
with
prompt
and
hearty
submission
in
the
cases
of
lamennais
and
frohschammer
no
speculative
question
was
originally
at
issue
but
only
the
question
of
authority
a
comparison
between
their
theories
will
explain
the
similarity
in
the
courses
of
the
two
men
and
at
the
same
time
will
account
for
the
contrast
between
the
isolation
of
lamennais
and
the
influence
of
frohschammer
though
the
one
was
the
most
eloquent
writer
in
france
and
the
head
of
a
great
school
and
the
other
before
the
late
controversy
was
not
a
writer
of
much
name
this
contrast
is
the
more
remarkable
since
religion
had
not
revived
in
france
when
the
french
philosopher
wrote
while
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
bavaria
has
been
distinguished
among
catholic
nations
for
the
faith
of
her
people
yet
lamennais
was
powerless
to
injure
a
generation
of
comparatively
catholics
while
frohschammer
with
inferior
gifts
of
persuasion
has
won
educated
followers
even
in
the
home
of
ultramontanism
the
first
obvious
explanation
of
this
difficulty
is
the
narrowness
of
lamennais
philosophy
at
the
time
of
his
dispute
with
the
holy
see
he
had
somewhat
lost
sight
of
his
traditionalist
theory
and
his
attention
concentrated
upon
politics
was
directed
to
the
problem
of
reconciling
religion
with
liberty
a
question
with
which
the
best
minds
in
france
are
still
occupied
but
how
can
a
view
of
policy
constitute
a
philosophy
he
began
by
thinking
that
it
was
expedient
for
the
church
to
obtain
the
safeguards
of
freedom
and
that
she
should
renounce
the
losing
cause
of
the
old
but
this
was
no
more
philosophy
than
the
similar
argument
which
had
previously
won
her
to
the
side
of
despotism
when
it
was
the
stronger
cause
as
bonald
however
had
erected
absolute
monarchy
into
a
dogma
so
lamennais
proceeded
to
do
with
freedom
the
church
he
said
was
on
the
side
of
freedom
because
it
was
the
just
side
not
because
it
was
the
stronger
as
de
maistre
had
seen
the
victory
of
catholic
principles
in
the
restoration
so
lamennais
saw
it
in
the
revolution
of
this
was
obviously
too
narrow
and
temporary
a
basis
for
a
philosophy
the
church
is
interested
not
in
the
triumph
of
a
principle
or
a
cause
which
may
be
dated
as
that
of
or
of
or
of
but
in
the
triumph
of
justice
and
the
just
cause
whether
it
be
that
of
the
people
or
of
the
crown
of
a
catholic
party
or
of
its
opponents
she
admits
the
tests
of
public
law
and
political
science
when
these
proclaim
the
existence
of
the
conditions
which
justify
an
insurrection
or
a
war
she
can
not
condemn
that
insurrection
or
that
war
she
is
guided
in
her
judgment
on
these
causes
by
criteria
which
are
not
her
own
but
are
borrowed
from
departments
over
which
she
has
no
supreme
control
this
is
as
true
of
science
as
it
is
of
law
and
politics
other
truths
are
as
certain
as
those
which
natural
or
positive
law
embraces
and
other
obligations
as
imperative
as
those
which
regulate
the
relations
of
subjects
and
authorities
the
principle
which
places
right
above
expedience
in
the
political
action
of
the
church
has
an
equal
application
in
history
or
in
astronomy
the
church
can
no
more
identify
her
cause
with
scientific
error
than
with
political
wrong
her
interests
may
be
impaired
by
some
measure
of
political
justice
or
by
the
admission
of
some
fact
or
document
but
in
neither
case
can
she
guard
her
interests
at
the
cost
of
denying
the
truth
this
is
the
principle
which
has
so
much
difficulty
in
obtaining
recognition
in
an
age
when
science
is
more
or
less
irreligious
and
when
catholics
more
or
less
neglect
its
study
political
and
intellectual
liberty
have
the
same
claims
and
the
same
conditions
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
the
catholic
judges
the
measures
of
governments
and
the
discoveries
of
science
in
exactly
the
same
manner
public
law
may
make
it
imperative
to
overthrow
a
catholic
monarch
like
james
or
to
uphold
a
protestant
monarch
like
the
king
of
prussia
the
demonstrations
of
science
may
oblige
us
to
believe
that
the
earth
revolves
round
the
sun
or
that
the
of
is
spurious
the
apparent
interests
of
religion
have
much
to
say
against
all
this
but
religion
itself
prevents
those
considerations
from
prevailing
this
has
not
been
seen
by
those
writers
who
have
done
most
in
defence
of
the
principle
they
have
usually
considered
it
from
the
standing
ground
of
their
own
practical
aims
and
have
therefore
failed
to
attain
that
general
view
which
might
have
been
suggested
to
them
by
the
pursuit
of
truth
as
a
whole
french
writers
have
done
much
for
political
liberty
and
germans
for
intellectual
liberty
but
the
defenders
of
the
one
cause
have
generally
had
so
little
sympathy
with
the
other
that
they
have
neglected
to
defend
their
own
on
the
grounds
common
to
both
there
is
hardly
a
catholic
writer
who
has
penetrated
to
the
common
source
from
which
they
spring
and
this
is
the
greatest
defect
in
catholic
literature
even
to
the
present
day
in
the
majority
of
those
who
have
afforded
the
chief
examples
of
this
error
and
particularly
in
lamennais
the
weakness
of
faith
which
it
implies
has
been
united
with
that
looseness
of
thought
which
resolves
all
knowledge
into
opinion
and
fails
to
appreciate
methodical
investigation
or
scientific
evidence
but
it
is
less
easy
to
explain
how
a
priest
fortified
with
the
armour
of
german
science
should
have
failed
as
completely
in
the
same
inquiry
in
order
to
solve
the
difficulty
we
must
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
theory
of
frohschammer
arose
and
review
some
of
the
circumstances
out
of
which
it
sprang
for
adjusting
the
relations
between
science
and
authority
the
method
of
rome
had
long
been
that
of
economy
and
accommodation
in
dealing
with
literature
her
paramount
consideration
was
the
fear
of
scandal
books
were
forbidden
not
merely
because
their
statements
were
denied
but
because
they
seemed
injurious
to
morals
derogatory
to
authority
or
dangerous
to
faith
to
be
so
it
was
not
necessary
that
they
should
be
untrue
for
isolated
truths
separated
from
other
known
truths
by
an
interval
of
conjecture
in
which
error
might
find
room
to
construct
its
works
may
offer
perilous
occasions
to
unprepared
and
unstable
minds
the
policy
was
therefore
to
allow
such
truths
to
be
put
forward
only
hypothetically
or
altogether
to
suppress
them
the
latter
alternative
was
especially
appropriated
to
historical
investigations
because
they
contained
most
elements
of
danger
in
them
the
progress
of
knowledge
has
been
for
centuries
constant
rapid
and
sure
every
generation
has
brought
to
light
masses
of
information
previously
unknown
the
successive
publication
of
which
furnished
ever
new
incentives
and
more
and
more
ample
means
of
inquiry
into
ecclesiastical
history
this
inquiry
has
gradually
laid
bare
the
whole
policy
and
process
of
ecclesiastical
authority
and
has
removed
from
the
past
that
veil
of
mystery
wherewith
like
all
other
authorities
it
tries
to
surround
the
present
the
human
element
in
ecclesiastical
administration
endeavours
to
keep
itself
out
of
sight
and
to
deny
its
own
existence
in
order
that
it
may
secure
the
unquestioning
submission
which
authority
naturally
desires
and
may
preserve
that
halo
of
infallibility
which
the
twilight
of
opinion
enables
it
to
assume
now
the
most
severe
exposure
of
the
part
played
by
this
human
element
is
found
in
histories
which
show
the
undeniable
existence
of
sin
error
or
fraud
in
the
high
places
of
the
church
not
indeed
that
any
history
furnishes
or
can
furnish
materials
for
undermining
the
authority
which
the
dogmas
of
the
church
proclaim
to
be
necessary
for
her
existence
but
the
true
limits
of
legitimate
authority
are
one
thing
and
the
area
which
authority
may
find
it
expedient
to
attempt
to
occupy
is
another
the
interests
of
the
church
are
not
necessarily
identical
with
those
of
the
ecclesiastical
government
a
government
does
not
desire
its
powers
to
be
strictly
defined
but
the
subjects
require
the
line
to
be
drawn
with
increasing
precision
authority
may
be
protected
by
its
subjects
being
kept
in
ignorance
of
its
faults
and
by
their
holding
it
in
superstitious
admiration
but
religion
has
no
communion
with
any
manner
of
error
and
the
conscience
can
only
be
injured
by
such
arts
which
in
reality
give
a
far
more
formidable
measure
of
the
influence
of
the
human
element
in
ecclesiastical
government
than
any
collection
of
detached
cases
of
scandal
can
do
for
these
arts
are
simply
those
of
all
human
governments
which
possess
legislative
power
fear
attack
deny
responsibility
and
therefore
shrink
from
scrutiny
one
of
the
great
instruments
for
preventing
historical
scrutiny
had
long
been
the
index
of
prohibited
books
which
was
accordingly
directed
not
against
falsehood
only
but
particularly
against
certain
departments
of
truth
through
it
an
effort
had
been
made
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
ecclesiastical
history
from
the
faithful
and
to
give
currency
to
a
fabulous
and
fictitious
picture
of
the
progress
and
action
of
the
church
the
means
would
have
been
found
quite
inadequate
to
the
end
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
while
society
was
absorbed
by
controversy
knowledge
was
only
valued
so
far
as
it
served
a
controversial
purpose
every
party
in
those
days
virtually
had
its
own
prohibitive
index
to
brand
all
inconvenient
truths
with
the
note
of
falsehood
no
party
cared
for
knowledge
that
could
not
be
made
available
for
argument
neutral
and
ambiguous
science
had
no
attractions
for
men
engaged
in
perpetual
combat
its
spirit
first
won
the
naturalists
the
mathematicians
and
the
philologists
then
it
vivified
the
otherwise
aimless
erudition
of
the
benedictines
and
at
last
it
was
carried
into
history
to
give
new
life
to
those
sciences
which
deal
with
the
tradition
the
law
and
the
action
of
the
church
the
home
of
this
transformation
was
in
the
universities
of
germany
for
there
the
catholic
teacher
was
placed
in
circumstances
altogether
novel
he
had
to
address
men
who
had
every
opportunity
of
becoming
familiar
with
the
arguments
of
the
enemies
of
the
church
and
with
the
discoveries
and
conclusions
of
those
whose
studies
were
without
the
bias
of
any
religious
object
whilst
he
lectured
in
one
room
the
next
might
be
occupied
by
a
pantheist
a
rationalist
or
a
lutheran
descanting
on
the
same
topics
when
he
left
the
desk
his
place
might
be
taken
by
some
great
original
thinker
or
scholar
who
would
display
all
the
results
of
his
meditations
without
regard
for
their
tendency
and
without
considering
what
effects
they
might
have
on
the
weak
he
was
obliged
often
to
draw
attention
to
books
lacking
the
catholic
spirit
but
indispensable
to
the
deeper
student
here
therefore
the
system
of
secrecy
economy
and
accommodation
was
rendered
impossible
by
the
competition
of
knowledge
in
which
the
most
thorough
exposition
of
the
truth
was
sure
of
the
victory
and
the
system
itself
became
inapplicable
as
the
scientific
spirit
penetrated
ecclesiastical
literature
in
germany
in
rome
however
where
the
influences
of
competition
were
not
felt
the
reasons
of
the
change
could
not
be
understood
nor
its
benefits
experienced
and
it
was
thought
absurd
that
the
germans
of
the
nineteenth
century
should
discard
weapons
which
had
been
found
efficacious
with
the
germans
of
the
sixteenth
while
in
rome
it
was
still
held
that
the
truths
of
science
need
not
be
told
and
ought
not
to
be
told
if
in
the
judgment
of
roman
theologians
they
were
of
a
nature
to
offend
faith
in
germany
catholics
vied
with
protestants
in
publishing
matter
without
being
diverted
by
the
consideration
whether
it
might
serve
or
injure
their
cause
in
controversy
or
whether
it
was
adverse
or
favourable
to
the
views
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
index
to
protect
but
though
this
great
antagonism
existed
there
was
no
collision
a
moderation
was
exhibited
which
contrasted
remarkably
with
the
aggressive
spirit
prevailing
in
france
and
italy
publications
were
suffered
to
pass
unnoted
in
germany
which
would
have
been
immediately
censured
if
they
had
come
forth
beyond
the
alps
or
the
rhine
in
this
way
a
certain
laxity
grew
up
side
by
side
with
an
unmeasured
distrust
and
german
theologians
and
historians
escaped
censure
this
toleration
gains
significance
from
its
contrast
to
the
severity
with
which
rome
smote
the
german
philosophers
like
hermes
and
günther
when
they
erred
here
indeed
the
case
was
very
different
if
rome
had
insisted
upon
suppressing
documents
perverting
facts
and
resisting
criticism
she
would
have
been
only
opposing
truth
and
opposing
it
consciously
for
fear
of
its
inconveniences
but
if
she
had
refrained
from
denouncing
a
philosophy
which
denied
creation
or
the
personality
of
god
she
would
have
failed
to
assert
her
own
doctrines
against
her
own
children
who
contradicted
them
the
philosopher
can
not
claim
the
same
exemption
as
the
historian
god
handwriting
exists
in
history
independently
of
the
church
and
no
ecclesiastical
exigence
can
alter
a
fact
the
divine
lesson
has
been
read
and
it
is
the
historian
duty
to
copy
it
faithfully
without
bias
and
without
ulterior
views
the
catholic
may
be
sure
that
as
the
church
has
lived
in
spite
of
the
fact
she
will
also
survive
its
publication
but
philosophy
has
to
deal
with
some
facts
which
although
as
absolute
and
objective
in
themselves
are
not
and
can
not
be
known
to
us
except
through
revelation
of
which
the
church
is
the
organ
a
philosophy
which
requires
the
alteration
of
these
facts
is
in
patent
contradiction
against
the
church
both
can
not
coexist
one
must
destroy
the
other
two
circumstances
very
naturally
arose
to
disturb
this
equilibrium
there
were
divines
who
wished
to
extend
to
germany
the
old
authority
of
the
index
and
to
censure
or
prohibit
books
which
though
not
heretical
contained
matter
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
ecclesiastical
authority
or
contrary
to
the
common
opinions
of
catholic
theologians
on
the
other
hand
there
were
philosophers
of
the
schools
of
hermes
and
günther
who
would
not
retract
the
doctrines
which
the
church
condemned
one
movement
tended
to
repress
even
the
knowledge
of
demonstrable
truth
and
the
other
aimed
at
destroying
the
dogmatic
authority
of
the
holy
see
in
this
way
a
collision
was
prepared
which
was
eventually
brought
about
by
the
writings
of
frohschammer
ten
years
ago
when
he
was
a
very
young
lecturer
on
philosophy
in
the
university
of
munich
he
published
a
work
on
the
origin
of
the
soul
in
which
he
argued
against
the
theory
of
and
against
the
common
opinion
that
each
soul
is
created
directly
by
almighty
god
defending
the
theory
of
generationism
by
the
authority
of
several
fathers
and
quoting
among
other
modern
divines
klee
the
author
of
the
most
esteemed
treatise
of
dogmatic
theology
in
the
german
language
it
was
decided
at
rome
that
his
book
should
be
condemned
and
he
was
informed
of
the
intention
in
order
that
he
might
announce
his
submission
before
the
publication
of
the
decree
his
position
was
a
difficult
one
and
it
appears
to
be
admitted
that
his
conduct
at
this
stage
was
not
prompted
by
those
opinions
on
the
authority
of
the
church
in
which
he
afterwards
took
refuge
but
must
be
explained
by
the
known
facts
of
the
case
his
doctrine
had
been
lately
taught
in
a
book
generally
read
and
approved
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
at
least
refuted
the
opposite
theories
and
yet
it
was
apparently
in
behalf
of
one
of
these
that
he
was
condemned
whatever
errors
his
book
contained
he
might
fear
that
an
act
of
submission
would
seem
to
imply
his
acceptance
of
an
opinion
he
heartily
believed
to
be
wrong
and
would
therefore
be
an
act
of
treason
to
truth
the
decree
conveyed
no
conviction
to
his
mind
it
is
only
the
utterances
of
an
infallible
authority
that
men
can
believe
without
argument
and
explanation
and
here
was
an
authority
not
infallible
giving
no
reasons
and
yet
claiming
a
submission
of
the
reason
frohschammer
found
himself
in
a
dilemma
to
submit
absolutely
would
either
be
a
virtual
acknowledgment
of
the
infallibility
of
the
authority
or
a
confession
that
an
ecclesiastical
decision
necessarily
bound
the
mind
irrespectively
of
its
truth
or
justice
in
either
case
he
would
have
contradicted
the
law
of
religion
and
of
the
church
to
submit
while
retaining
his
own
opinion
to
a
disciplinary
decree
in
order
to
preserve
peace
and
avoid
scandal
and
to
make
a
general
acknowledgment
that
his
work
contained
various
and
equivocal
statements
which
might
bear
a
bad
construction
such
a
conditional
submission
either
would
not
have
been
that
which
the
roman
court
desired
and
intended
or
if
made
without
explicit
statement
of
its
meaning
would
have
been
in
some
measure
deceitful
and
hypocritical
in
the
first
case
it
would
not
have
been
received
in
the
second
case
it
could
not
have
been
made
without
loss
of
moreover
as
the
writer
was
a
public
professor
bound
to
instruct
his
hearers
according
to
his
best
knowledge
he
could
not
change
his
teaching
while
his
opinion
remained
unchanged
these
considerations
and
not
any
desire
to
defy
authority
or
introduce
new
opinions
by
a
process
more
or
less
revolutionary
appear
to
have
guided
his
conduct
at
this
period
it
might
have
been
possible
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
or
to
obtain
satisfactory
explanations
if
the
roman
court
would
have
told
him
what
points
were
at
issue
what
passages
in
his
book
were
impugned
and
what
were
the
grounds
for
suspecting
them
if
there
was
on
both
sides
a
peaceful
and
conciliatory
spirit
and
a
desire
to
settle
the
problem
there
was
certainly
a
chance
of
effecting
it
by
a
candid
interchange
of
explanations
it
was
a
course
which
had
proved
efficacious
on
other
occasions
and
in
the
then
recent
discussion
of
günther
system
it
had
been
pursued
with
great
patience
and
decided
success
before
giving
a
definite
reply
therefore
frohschammer
asked
for
information
about
the
incriminated
articles
this
would
have
given
him
an
opportunity
of
seeing
his
error
and
making
a
submission
foro
but
the
request
was
refused
it
was
a
favour
he
was
told
sometimes
extended
to
men
whose
great
services
to
the
church
deserved
such
consideration
but
not
to
one
who
was
hardly
known
except
by
the
very
book
which
had
incurred
the
censure
this
answer
instantly
aroused
a
suspicion
that
the
roman
court
was
more
anxious
to
assert
its
authority
than
to
correct
an
alleged
error
or
to
prevent
a
scandal
it
was
well
known
that
the
mistrust
of
german
philosophy
was
very
deep
at
rome
and
it
seemed
far
from
impossible
that
an
intention
existed
to
put
it
under
all
possible
restraint
this
mistrust
on
the
part
of
the
roman
divines
was
fully
equalled
and
so
far
justified
by
a
corresponding
literary
contempt
on
the
part
of
many
german
catholic
scholars
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
grounds
of
this
feeling
the
german
writers
were
engaged
in
an
arduous
struggle
in
which
their
antagonists
were
sustained
by
intellectual
power
solid
learning
and
deep
thought
such
as
the
defenders
of
the
church
in
catholic
countries
have
never
had
to
encounter
in
this
conflict
the
italian
divines
could
render
no
assistance
they
had
shown
themselves
altogether
incompetent
to
cope
with
modern
science
the
germans
therefore
unable
to
recognise
them
as
auxiliaries
soon
ceased
to
regard
them
as
equals
or
as
scientific
divines
at
all
without
impeaching
their
orthodoxy
they
learned
to
look
on
them
as
men
incapable
of
understanding
and
mastering
the
ideas
of
a
literature
so
very
remote
from
their
own
and
to
attach
no
more
value
to
the
unreasoned
decrees
of
their
organ
than
to
the
undefended
of
a
theologian
of
secondary
rank
this
opinion
sprang
not
from
national
prejudice
or
from
the
of
individuals
comparing
their
own
works
with
those
of
the
roman
divines
but
from
a
general
view
of
the
relation
of
those
divines
among
whom
there
are
several
distinguished
germans
to
the
literature
of
germany
it
was
thus
a
corporate
feeling
which
might
be
shared
even
by
one
who
was
conscious
of
his
own
inferiority
or
who
had
written
nothing
at
all
such
a
man
weighing
the
opinion
of
the
theologians
of
the
gesù
and
the
minerva
not
in
the
scale
of
his
own
performance
but
in
that
of
the
great
achievements
of
his
age
might
well
be
reluctant
to
accept
their
verdict
upon
them
without
some
aid
of
argument
and
explanation
on
the
other
hand
it
appeared
that
a
blow
which
struck
the
catholic
scholars
of
germany
would
assure
to
the
victorious
congregation
of
roman
divines
an
easy
supremacy
over
the
writers
of
all
other
countries
the
case
of
frohschammer
might
be
made
to
test
what
degree
of
control
it
would
be
possible
to
exercise
over
his
countrymen
the
only
body
of
writers
at
whom
alarm
was
felt
and
who
insisted
more
than
others
on
their
freedom
but
the
suspicion
of
such
a
possibility
was
likely
only
to
confirm
him
in
the
idea
that
he
was
chosen
to
be
the
experimental
body
on
which
an
important
principle
was
to
be
decided
and
that
it
was
his
duty
till
his
dogmatic
error
was
proved
to
resist
a
questionable
encroachment
of
authority
upon
the
rights
of
freedom
he
therefore
refused
to
make
the
preliminary
submission
which
was
required
of
him
and
allowed
the
decree
to
go
forth
against
him
in
the
usual
way
hereupon
it
was
intimated
to
him
though
not
by
rome
that
he
had
incurred
excommunication
this
was
the
measure
which
raised
the
momentous
question
of
the
liberties
of
catholic
science
and
gave
the
impulse
to
that
new
theory
on
the
limits
of
authority
with
which
his
name
has
become
associated
in
the
civil
affairs
of
mankind
it
is
necessary
to
assume
that
the
knowledge
of
the
moral
code
and
the
traditions
of
law
can
not
perish
in
a
christian
nation
particular
authorities
may
fall
into
error
decisions
may
be
appealed
against
laws
may
be
repealed
but
the
political
conscience
of
the
whole
people
can
not
be
irrecoverably
lost
the
church
possesses
the
same
privilege
but
in
a
much
higher
degree
for
she
exists
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
a
definite
body
of
truths
the
knowledge
of
which
she
can
never
lose
whatever
authority
therefore
expresses
that
knowledge
of
which
she
is
the
keeper
must
be
obeyed
but
there
is
no
institution
from
which
this
knowledge
can
be
obtained
with
immediate
certainty
a
council
is
not
oecumenical
the
holy
see
is
not
separately
infallible
the
one
has
to
await
a
sanction
the
other
has
repeatedly
erred
every
decree
therefore
requires
a
preliminary
examination
a
writer
who
is
censured
may
in
the
first
place
yield
an
external
submission
either
for
the
sake
of
discipline
or
because
his
conviction
is
too
weak
to
support
him
against
the
weight
of
authority
but
if
the
question
at
issue
is
more
important
than
the
preservation
of
peace
and
if
his
conviction
is
strong
he
inquires
whether
the
authority
which
condemns
him
utters
the
voice
of
the
church
if
he
finds
that
it
does
he
yields
to
it
or
ceases
to
profess
the
faith
of
catholics
if
he
finds
that
it
does
not
but
is
only
the
voice
of
authority
he
owes
it
to
his
conscience
and
to
the
supreme
claims
of
truth
to
remain
constant
to
that
which
he
believes
in
spite
of
opposition
no
authority
has
power
to
impose
error
and
if
it
resists
the
truth
the
truth
must
be
upheld
until
it
is
admitted
now
the
adversaries
of
frohschammer
had
fallen
into
the
monstrous
error
of
attributing
to
the
congregation
of
the
index
a
share
in
the
infallibility
of
the
church
he
was
placed
in
the
position
of
a
persecuted
man
and
the
general
sympathy
was
with
him
in
his
defence
he
proceeded
to
state
his
theory
of
the
rights
of
science
in
order
to
vindicate
the
church
from
the
imputation
of
restricting
its
freedom
hitherto
his
works
had
been
written
in
defence
of
a
christian
philosophy
against
materialism
and
infidelity
their
object
had
been
thoroughly
religious
and
although
he
was
not
deeply
read
in
ecclesiastical
literature
and
was
often
loose
and
incautious
in
the
use
of
theological
terms
his
writings
had
not
been
wanting
in
catholicity
of
spirit
but
after
his
condemnation
by
rome
he
undertook
to
pull
down
the
power
which
had
dealt
the
blow
and
to
make
himself
safe
for
the
future
in
this
spirit
of
personal
antagonism
he
commenced
a
long
series
of
writings
in
defence
of
freedom
and
in
defiance
of
authority
the
following
abstract
marks
not
so
much
the
outline
of
his
system
as
the
logical
steps
which
carried
him
to
the
point
where
he
passed
beyond
the
limit
of
catholicism
religion
he
taught
supplies
materials
but
no
criterion
for
philosophy
philosophy
has
nothing
to
rely
on
in
the
last
resort
but
the
unfailing
veracity
of
our
nature
which
is
not
corrupt
or
weak
but
normally
healthy
and
unable
to
deceive
us
there
is
not
greater
division
or
uncertainty
in
matters
of
speculation
than
on
questions
of
faith
if
at
any
time
error
or
doubt
should
arise
the
science
possesses
in
itself
the
means
of
correcting
or
removing
it
and
no
other
remedy
is
efficacious
but
that
which
it
applies
to
itself
there
can
be
no
free
philosophy
if
we
must
always
remember
dogma
philosophy
includes
in
its
sphere
all
the
dogmas
of
revelation
as
well
as
those
of
natural
religion
it
examines
by
its
own
independent
light
the
substance
of
every
christian
doctrine
and
determines
in
each
case
whether
it
be
divine
truth
the
conclusions
and
judgments
at
which
it
thus
arrives
must
be
maintained
even
when
they
contradict
articles
of
faith
as
we
accept
the
evidence
of
astronomy
in
opposition
to
the
once
settled
opinion
of
divines
so
we
should
not
shrink
from
the
evidence
of
chemistry
if
it
should
be
adverse
to
transubstantiation
the
church
on
the
other
hand
examines
these
conclusions
by
her
standard
of
faith
and
decides
whether
they
can
be
taught
in
theology
but
she
has
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
philosophical
truth
of
an
opinion
and
can
not
convict
the
philosopher
of
error
the
two
domains
are
as
distinct
as
reason
and
faith
and
we
must
not
identify
what
we
know
with
what
we
believe
but
must
separate
the
philosopher
from
his
philosophy
the
system
may
be
utterly
at
variance
with
the
whole
teaching
of
christianity
and
yet
the
philosopher
while
he
holds
it
to
be
philosophically
true
and
certain
may
continue
to
believe
all
catholic
doctrine
and
to
perform
all
the
spiritual
duties
of
a
layman
or
a
priest
for
discord
can
not
exist
between
the
certain
results
of
scientific
investigation
and
the
real
doctrines
of
the
church
both
are
true
and
there
is
no
conflict
of
truths
but
while
the
teaching
of
science
is
distinct
and
definite
that
of
the
church
is
subject
to
alteration
theology
is
at
no
time
absolutely
complete
but
always
liable
to
be
modified
and
can
not
therefore
be
made
a
fixed
test
of
truth
consequently
there
is
no
reason
against
the
union
of
the
churches
for
the
liberty
of
private
judgment
which
is
the
formal
principle
of
protestantism
belongs
to
catholics
and
there
is
no
actual
catholic
dogma
which
may
not
lose
all
that
is
objectionable
to
protestants
by
the
transforming
process
of
development
the
errors
of
frohschammer
in
these
passages
are
not
exclusively
his
own
he
has
only
drawn
certain
conclusions
from
premisses
which
are
very
commonly
received
nothing
is
more
usual
than
to
confound
religious
truth
with
the
voice
of
ecclesiastical
authority
frohschammer
having
fallen
into
this
vulgar
mistake
argues
that
because
the
authority
is
fallible
the
truth
must
be
uncertain
many
catholics
attribute
to
theological
opinions
which
have
prevailed
for
centuries
without
reproach
a
sacredness
nearly
approaching
that
which
belongs
to
articles
of
faith
frohschammer
extends
to
defined
dogmas
the
liability
to
change
which
belongs
to
opinions
that
yet
await
a
final
and
conclusive
investigation
thousands
of
zealous
men
are
persuaded
that
a
conflict
may
arise
between
defined
doctrines
of
the
church
and
conclusions
which
are
certain
according
to
all
the
tests
of
science
frohschammer
adopts
this
view
and
argues
that
none
of
the
decisions
of
the
church
are
final
and
that
consequently
in
such
a
case
they
must
give
way
lastly
uninstructed
men
commonly
impute
to
historical
and
natural
science
the
uncertainty
which
is
inseparable
from
pure
speculation
frohschammer
accepts
the
equality
but
claims
for
metaphysics
the
same
certainty
and
independence
which
those
sciences
possess
having
begun
his
course
in
company
with
many
who
have
exactly
opposite
ends
in
view
frohschammer
in
a
recent
tract
on
the
union
of
the
churches
entirely
separates
himself
from
the
catholic
church
in
his
theory
of
development
he
had
received
the
impulse
to
his
new
system
from
the
opposition
of
those
whom
he
considered
the
advocates
of
an
excessive
uniformity
and
the
enemies
of
progress
and
their
contradiction
has
driven
him
to
a
point
where
he
entirely
sacrifices
unity
to
change
he
now
affirms
that
our
lord
desired
no
unity
or
perfect
conformity
among
his
followers
except
in
morals
and
charity
that
he
gave
no
definite
system
of
doctrine
and
that
the
form
which
christian
faith
may
have
assumed
in
a
particular
age
has
no
validity
for
all
future
time
but
is
subject
to
continual
modification
the
definitions
he
says
which
the
church
has
made
from
time
to
time
are
not
to
be
obstinately
adhered
to
and
the
advancement
of
religious
knowledge
is
obtained
by
genius
not
by
learning
and
is
not
regulated
by
traditions
and
fixed
rules
he
maintains
that
not
only
the
form
but
the
substance
varies
that
the
belief
of
one
age
may
be
not
only
extended
but
abandoned
in
another
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
draw
the
line
which
separates
immutable
dogma
from
undecided
opinions
the
causes
which
drove
frohschammer
into
heresy
would
scarcely
have
deserved
great
attention
from
the
mere
merit
of
the
man
for
he
can
not
be
acquitted
of
having
in
the
first
instance
exhibited
very
superficial
notions
of
theology
their
instructiveness
consists
in
the
conspicuous
example
they
afford
of
the
effect
of
certain
errors
which
at
the
present
day
are
commonly
held
and
rarely
contradicted
when
he
found
himself
censured
unjustly
as
he
thought
by
the
holy
see
it
should
have
been
enough
for
him
to
believe
in
his
conscience
that
he
was
in
agreement
with
the
true
faith
of
the
church
he
would
not
then
have
proceeded
to
consider
the
whole
church
infected
with
the
liability
to
err
from
which
her
rulers
are
not
exempt
or
to
degrade
the
fundamental
truths
of
christianity
to
the
level
of
mere
school
opinions
authority
appeared
in
his
eyes
to
stand
for
the
whole
church
and
therefore
in
endeavouring
to
shield
himself
from
its
influence
he
abandoned
the
first
principles
of
the
ecclesiastical
system
far
from
having
aided
the
cause
of
freedom
his
errors
have
provoked
a
reaction
against
it
which
must
be
looked
upon
with
deep
anxiety
and
of
which
the
first
significant
symptom
remains
to
be
described
on
the
of
december
the
pope
addressed
a
brief
to
the
archbishop
of
munich
which
was
published
on
the
of
march
this
document
explains
that
the
holy
father
had
originally
been
led
to
suspect
the
recent
congress
at
munich
of
a
tendency
similar
to
that
of
frohschammer
and
had
consequently
viewed
it
with
great
distrust
but
that
these
feelings
were
removed
by
the
address
which
was
adopted
at
the
meeting
and
by
the
report
of
the
archbishop
and
he
expresses
the
consolation
he
has
derived
from
the
principles
which
prevailed
in
the
assembly
and
applauds
the
design
of
those
by
whom
it
was
convened
he
asked
for
the
opinion
of
the
german
prelates
in
order
to
be
able
to
determine
whether
in
the
present
circumstances
of
their
church
it
is
right
that
the
congress
should
be
renewed
besides
the
censure
of
the
doctrines
of
frohschammer
and
the
approbation
given
to
the
acts
of
the
munich
congress
the
brief
contains
passages
of
deeper
and
more
general
import
not
directly
touching
the
action
of
the
german
divines
but
having
an
important
bearing
on
the
position
of
this
the
substance
of
these
passages
is
as
follows
in
the
present
condition
of
society
the
supreme
authority
in
the
church
is
more
than
ever
necessary
and
must
not
surrender
in
the
smallest
degree
the
exclusive
direction
of
ecclesiastical
knowledge
an
entire
obedience
to
the
decrees
of
the
holy
see
and
the
roman
congregations
can
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
freedom
and
progress
of
science
the
disposition
to
find
fault
with
the
scholastic
theology
and
to
dispute
the
conclusions
and
the
method
of
its
teachers
threatens
the
authority
of
the
church
because
the
church
has
not
only
allowed
theology
to
remain
for
centuries
faithful
to
their
system
but
has
urgently
recommended
it
as
the
safest
bulwark
of
the
faith
and
an
efficient
weapon
against
her
enemies
catholic
writers
are
not
bound
only
by
those
decisions
of
the
infallible
church
which
regard
articles
of
faith
they
must
also
submit
to
the
theological
decisions
of
the
roman
congregations
and
to
the
opinions
which
are
commonly
received
in
the
schools
and
it
is
wrong
though
not
heretical
to
reject
those
decisions
or
opinions
in
a
word
therefore
the
brief
affirms
that
the
common
opinions
and
explanations
of
catholic
divines
ought
not
to
yield
to
the
progress
of
secular
science
and
that
the
course
of
theological
knowledge
ought
to
be
controlled
by
the
decrees
of
the
index
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
letter
of
this
document
might
be
interpreted
in
a
sense
consistent
with
the
habitual
language
of
the
and
foreign
on
the
one
hand
the
censure
is
evidently
aimed
at
that
exaggerated
claim
of
independence
which
would
deny
to
the
pope
and
the
episcopate
any
right
of
interfering
in
literature
and
would
transfer
the
whole
weight
heretofore
belonging
to
the
traditions
of
the
schools
of
theology
to
the
incomplete
and
therefore
uncertain
conclusions
of
modern
science
on
the
other
hand
the
has
always
maintained
in
common
with
all
catholics
that
if
the
one
church
has
an
organ
it
is
through
that
organ
that
she
must
speak
that
her
authority
is
not
limited
to
the
precise
sphere
of
her
infallibility
and
that
opinions
which
she
has
long
tolerated
or
approved
and
has
for
centuries
found
compatible
with
the
secular
as
well
as
religious
knowledge
of
the
age
can
not
be
lightly
supplanted
by
new
hypotheses
of
scientific
men
which
have
not
yet
had
time
to
prove
their
consistency
with
dogmatic
truth
but
such
a
plausible
accommodation
even
if
it
were
honest
or
dignified
would
only
disguise
and
obscure
those
ideas
which
it
has
been
the
chief
object
of
the
to
proclaim
it
is
therefore
not
only
more
respectful
to
the
holy
see
but
more
serviceable
to
the
principles
of
the
itself
and
more
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
in
which
it
has
been
conducted
to
interpret
the
words
of
the
pope
as
they
were
really
meant
than
to
elude
their
consequences
by
subtle
distinctions
and
to
profess
a
formal
adoption
of
maxims
which
no
man
who
holds
the
principles
of
the
can
accept
in
their
intended
signification
one
of
these
maxims
is
that
theological
and
other
opinions
long
held
and
allowed
in
the
church
gather
truth
from
time
and
an
authority
in
some
sort
binding
from
the
implied
sanction
of
the
holy
see
so
that
they
can
not
be
rejected
without
rashness
and
that
the
decrees
of
the
congregation
of
the
index
possess
an
authority
quite
independent
of
the
acquirements
of
the
men
composing
it
this
is
no
new
opinion
it
is
only
expressed
on
the
present
occasion
with
unusual
solemnity
and
distinctness
but
one
of
the
essential
principles
of
this
consists
in
a
clear
recognition
first
of
the
infinite
gulf
which
in
theology
separates
what
is
of
faith
from
what
is
not
of
faith
revealed
dogmas
from
opinions
unconnected
with
them
by
logical
necessity
and
therefore
incapable
of
anything
higher
than
a
natural
certainty
and
next
of
the
practical
difference
which
exists
in
ecclesiastical
discipline
between
the
acts
of
infallible
authority
and
those
which
possess
no
higher
sanction
than
that
of
canonical
legality
that
which
is
not
decided
with
dogmatic
infallibility
is
for
the
time
susceptible
only
of
a
scientific
determination
which
advances
with
the
progress
of
science
and
becomes
absolute
only
where
science
has
attained
its
final
results
on
the
one
hand
this
scientific
progress
is
beneficial
and
even
necessary
to
the
church
on
the
other
it
must
inevitably
be
opposed
by
the
guardians
of
traditional
opinion
to
whom
as
such
no
share
in
it
belongs
and
who
by
their
own
acts
and
those
of
their
predecessors
are
committed
to
views
which
it
menaces
or
destroys
the
same
principle
which
in
certain
conjunctures
imposes
the
duty
of
surrendering
received
opinions
imposes
in
equal
extent
and
under
like
conditions
the
duty
of
disregarding
the
fallible
authorities
that
uphold
them
it
is
the
design
of
the
holy
see
not
of
course
to
deny
the
distinction
between
dogma
and
opinion
upon
which
this
duty
is
founded
but
to
reduce
the
practical
recognition
of
it
among
catholics
to
the
smallest
possible
limits
a
grave
question
therefore
arises
as
to
the
position
of
a
founded
in
great
part
for
the
purpose
of
exemplifying
this
distinction
in
considering
the
solution
of
this
question
two
circumstances
must
be
borne
in
mind
first
that
the
antagonism
now
so
forcibly
expressed
has
always
been
known
and
acknowledged
and
secondly
that
no
part
of
the
brief
applies
directly
to
the
the
was
as
distinctly
opposed
to
the
roman
sentiment
before
the
brief
as
since
and
it
is
still
as
free
from
censure
as
before
it
was
at
no
time
in
virtual
sympathy
with
authority
on
the
points
in
question
and
it
is
not
now
in
formal
conflict
with
authority
but
the
definiteness
with
which
the
holy
see
has
pronounced
its
will
and
the
fact
that
it
has
taken
the
initiative
seem
positively
to
invite
adhesion
and
to
convey
a
special
warning
to
all
who
have
expressed
opinions
contrary
to
the
maxims
of
the
brief
a
periodical
which
not
only
has
done
so
but
exists
in
a
measure
for
the
purpose
of
doing
so
can
not
with
propriety
refuse
to
survey
the
new
position
in
which
it
is
placed
by
this
important
act
for
the
conduct
of
a
involves
more
delicate
relations
with
the
government
of
the
church
than
the
authorship
of
an
isolated
book
when
opinions
which
an
author
defends
are
rejected
at
rome
he
either
makes
his
submission
or
if
his
mind
remains
unaltered
silently
leaves
his
book
to
take
its
chance
and
to
influence
men
according
to
its
merits
but
such
passivity
however
right
and
seemly
in
the
author
of
a
book
is
inapplicable
to
the
case
of
a
the
periodical
iteration
of
rejected
propositions
would
amount
to
insult
and
defiance
and
would
probably
provoke
more
definite
measures
and
thus
the
result
would
be
to
commit
authority
yet
more
irrevocably
to
an
opinion
which
otherwise
might
take
no
deep
root
and
might
yield
ultimately
to
the
influence
of
time
for
it
is
hard
to
surrender
a
cause
on
behalf
of
which
a
struggle
has
been
sustained
and
spiritual
evils
have
been
inflicted
in
an
isolated
book
the
author
need
discuss
no
more
topics
than
he
likes
and
any
want
of
agreement
with
ecclesiastical
authority
may
receive
so
little
prominence
as
to
excite
no
attention
but
a
continuous
which
adopted
this
kind
of
reserve
would
give
a
negative
prominence
to
the
topics
it
persistently
avoided
and
by
thus
keeping
before
the
world
the
position
it
occupied
would
hold
out
a
perpetual
invitation
to
its
readers
to
judge
between
the
church
and
itself
whatever
it
gained
of
approbation
and
assent
would
be
so
much
lost
to
the
authority
and
dignity
of
the
holy
see
it
could
only
hope
to
succeed
by
trading
on
the
scandal
it
caused
but
in
reality
its
success
could
no
longer
advance
the
cause
of
truth
for
what
is
the
holy
see
in
its
relation
to
the
masses
of
catholics
and
where
does
its
strength
lie
it
is
the
organ
the
mouth
the
head
of
the
church
its
strength
consists
in
its
agreement
with
the
general
conviction
of
the
faithful
when
it
expresses
the
common
knowledge
and
sense
of
the
age
or
of
a
large
majority
of
catholics
its
position
is
impregnable
the
force
it
derives
from
this
general
support
makes
direct
opposition
hopeless
and
therefore
disedifying
tending
only
to
division
and
promoting
reaction
rather
than
reform
the
influence
by
which
it
is
to
be
moved
must
be
directed
first
on
that
which
gives
its
strength
and
must
pervade
the
members
in
order
that
it
may
reach
the
head
while
the
general
sentiment
of
catholics
is
unaltered
the
course
of
the
holy
see
remains
unaltered
too
as
soon
as
that
sentiment
is
modified
rome
sympathises
with
the
change
the
ecclesiastical
government
based
upon
the
public
opinion
of
the
church
and
acting
through
it
can
not
separate
itself
from
the
mass
of
the
faithful
and
keep
pace
with
the
progress
of
the
instructed
minority
it
follows
slowly
and
warily
and
sometimes
begins
by
resisting
and
denouncing
what
in
the
end
it
thoroughly
adopts
hence
a
direct
controversy
with
rome
holds
out
the
prospect
of
great
evils
and
at
best
a
barren
and
unprofitable
victory
the
victory
that
is
fruitful
springs
from
that
gradual
change
in
the
knowledge
the
ideas
and
the
convictions
of
the
catholic
body
which
in
due
time
overcomes
the
natural
reluctance
to
forsake
a
beaten
path
and
by
insensible
degrees
constrains
the
mouthpiece
of
tradition
to
conform
itself
to
the
new
atmosphere
with
which
it
is
surrounded
the
slow
silent
indirect
action
of
public
opinion
bears
the
holy
see
along
without
any
demoralising
conflict
or
dishonourable
capitulation
this
action
belongs
essentially
to
the
graver
scientific
literature
to
direct
and
the
inquiry
what
form
that
literature
should
assume
at
any
given
moment
involves
no
question
which
affects
its
substance
though
it
may
often
involve
questions
of
moral
fitness
sufficiently
decisive
for
a
particular
occasion
it
was
never
pretended
that
the
and
foreign
represented
the
opinions
of
the
majority
of
catholics
the
holy
see
has
had
their
support
in
maintaining
a
view
of
the
obligations
of
catholic
literature
very
different
from
the
one
which
has
been
upheld
in
these
pages
nor
could
it
explicitly
abandon
that
view
without
taking
up
a
new
position
in
the
church
all
that
could
be
hoped
for
on
the
other
side
was
silence
and
forbearance
and
for
a
time
they
have
been
conceded
but
this
is
the
case
no
longer
the
toleration
has
now
been
pointedly
withdrawn
and
the
adversaries
of
the
roman
theory
have
been
challenged
with
the
summons
to
submit
if
the
opinions
for
which
submission
is
claimed
were
new
or
if
the
opposition
now
signalised
were
one
of
which
there
had
hitherto
been
any
doubt
a
question
might
have
arisen
as
to
the
limits
of
the
authority
of
the
holy
see
over
the
conscience
and
the
necessity
or
possibility
of
accepting
the
view
which
it
propounds
but
no
problem
of
this
kind
has
in
fact
presented
itself
for
consideration
the
differences
which
are
now
proclaimed
have
all
along
been
acknowledged
to
exist
and
the
conductors
of
this
are
unable
to
yield
their
assent
to
the
opinions
put
forward
in
the
brief
in
these
circumstances
there
are
two
courses
which
it
is
impossible
to
take
it
would
be
wrong
to
abandon
principles
which
have
been
well
considered
and
are
sincerely
held
and
it
would
also
be
wrong
to
assail
the
authority
which
contradicts
them
the
principles
have
not
ceased
to
be
true
nor
the
authority
to
be
legitimate
because
the
two
are
in
contradiction
to
submit
the
intellect
and
conscience
without
examining
the
reasonableness
and
justice
of
this
decree
or
to
reject
the
authority
on
the
ground
of
its
having
been
abused
would
equally
be
a
sin
on
one
side
against
morals
on
the
other
against
faith
the
conscience
can
not
be
relieved
by
casting
on
the
administrators
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
the
whole
responsibility
of
preserving
religious
truth
nor
can
it
be
emancipated
by
a
virtual
apostasy
for
the
church
is
neither
a
despotism
in
which
the
convictions
of
the
faithful
possess
no
power
of
expressing
themselves
and
no
means
of
exercising
legitimate
control
nor
is
it
an
organised
anarchy
where
the
judicial
and
administrative
powers
are
destitute
of
that
authority
which
is
conceded
to
them
in
civil
society
the
authority
which
commands
submission
even
where
it
can
not
impose
a
conviction
of
the
righteousness
of
its
acts
no
catholic
can
contemplate
without
alarm
the
evil
that
would
be
caused
by
a
catholic
journal
persistently
labouring
to
thwart
the
published
will
of
the
holy
see
and
continuously
defying
its
authority
the
conductors
of
this
refuse
to
take
upon
themselves
the
responsibility
of
such
a
position
and
if
it
were
accepted
the
would
represent
no
section
of
catholics
but
the
representative
character
is
as
essential
to
it
as
the
opinions
it
professes
or
the
literary
resources
it
commands
there
is
no
lack
of
periodical
publications
representing
science
apart
from
religion
or
religion
apart
from
science
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
and
foreign
has
been
that
it
has
attempted
to
exhibit
the
two
in
union
and
the
interest
which
has
been
attached
to
its
views
proceeded
from
the
fact
that
they
were
put
forward
as
essentially
catholic
in
proportion
to
their
scientific
truth
and
as
expressing
more
faithfully
than
even
the
voice
of
authority
the
genuine
spirit
of
the
church
in
relation
to
intellect
its
object
has
been
to
elucidate
the
harmony
which
exists
between
religion
and
the
established
conclusions
of
secular
knowledge
and
to
exhibit
the
real
amity
and
sympathy
between
the
methods
of
science
and
the
methods
employed
by
the
church
that
amity
and
sympathy
the
enemies
of
the
church
refuse
to
admit
and
her
friends
have
not
learned
to
understand
long
disowned
by
a
large
part
of
our
episcopate
they
are
now
rejected
by
the
holy
see
and
the
issue
is
vital
to
a
which
in
ceasing
to
uphold
them
would
surrender
the
whole
reason
of
its
existence
warned
therefore
by
the
language
of
the
brief
i
will
not
provoke
ecclesiastical
authority
to
a
more
explicit
repudiation
of
doctrines
which
are
necessary
to
secure
its
influence
upon
the
advance
of
modern
science
i
will
not
challenge
a
conflict
which
would
only
deceive
the
world
into
a
belief
that
religion
can
not
be
harmonised
with
all
that
is
right
and
true
in
the
progress
of
the
present
age
but
i
will
sacrifice
the
existence
of
the
to
the
defence
of
its
principles
in
order
that
i
may
combine
the
obedience
which
is
due
to
legitimate
ecclesiastical
authority
with
an
equally
conscientious
maintenance
of
the
rightful
and
necessary
liberty
of
thought
a
conjuncture
like
the
present
does
not
perplex
the
conscience
of
a
catholic
for
his
obligation
to
refrain
from
wounding
the
peace
of
the
church
is
neither
more
nor
less
real
than
that
of
professing
nothing
beside
or
against
his
convictions
if
these
duties
have
not
been
always
understood
at
least
the
and
foreign
will
not
betray
them
and
the
cause
it
has
imperfectly
expounded
can
be
more
efficiently
served
in
future
by
means
which
will
neither
weaken
the
position
of
authority
nor
depend
for
their
influence
on
its
approval
if
as
i
have
heard
but
now
am
scarcely
anxious
to
believe
there
are
those
both
in
the
communion
of
the
church
and
out
of
it
who
have
found
comfort
in
the
existence
of
this
and
have
watched
its
straight
short
course
with
hopeful
interest
trusting
it
as
a
sign
that
the
knowledge
deposited
in
their
minds
by
study
and
transformed
by
conscience
into
inviolable
convictions
was
not
only
tolerated
among
catholics
but
might
be
reasonably
held
to
be
of
the
very
essence
of
their
system
who
were
willing
to
accept
its
principles
as
a
possible
solution
of
the
difficulties
they
saw
in
catholicism
and
were
even
prepared
to
make
its
fate
the
touchstone
of
the
real
spirit
of
our
hierarchy
or
who
deemed
that
while
it
lasted
it
promised
them
some
immunity
from
the
overwhelming
pressure
of
uniformity
some
safeguard
against
resistance
to
the
growth
of
knowledge
and
of
freedom
and
some
protection
for
themselves
since
however
weak
its
influence
as
an
auxiliary
it
would
by
its
position
encounter
the
first
shock
and
so
divert
from
others
the
censures
which
they
apprehended
who
have
found
a
welcome
encouragement
in
its
confidence
a
satisfaction
in
its
sincerity
when
they
shrank
from
revealing
their
own
thoughts
or
a
salutary
restraint
when
its
moderation
failed
to
satisfy
their
ardour
whom
not
being
catholics
it
has
induced
to
think
less
hardly
of
the
church
or
being
catholics
has
bound
more
strongly
to
her
to
all
these
i
would
say
that
the
principles
it
has
upheld
will
not
die
with
it
but
will
find
their
destined
advocates
and
triumph
in
their
appointed
time
from
the
beginning
of
the
church
it
has
been
a
law
of
her
nature
that
the
truths
which
eventually
proved
themselves
the
legitimate
products
of
her
doctrine
have
had
to
make
their
slow
way
upwards
through
a
phalanx
of
hostile
habits
and
traditions
and
to
be
rescued
not
only
from
open
enemies
but
also
from
friendly
hands
that
were
not
worthy
to
defend
them
it
is
right
that
in
every
arduous
enterprise
some
one
who
stakes
no
influence
on
the
issue
should
make
the
first
essay
whilst
the
true
champions
like
the
triarii
of
the
roman
legions
are
behind
and
wait
without
wavering
until
the
crisis
calls
them
forward
and
already
it
seems
to
have
arrived
all
that
is
being
done
for
ecclesiastical
learning
by
the
priesthood
of
the
continent
bears
testimony
to
the
truths
which
are
now
called
in
question
and
every
work
of
real
science
written
by
a
catholic
adds
to
their
force
the
example
of
great
writers
aids
their
cause
more
powerfully
than
many
theoretical
discussions
indeed
when
the
principles
of
the
antagonism
which
divides
catholics
have
been
brought
clearly
out
the
part
of
theory
is
accomplished
and
most
of
the
work
of
a
is
done
it
remains
that
the
principles
which
have
been
made
intelligible
should
be
translated
into
practice
and
should
pass
from
the
arena
of
discussion
into
the
ethical
code
of
literature
in
that
shape
their
efficacy
will
be
acknowledged
and
they
will
cease
to
be
the
object
of
alarm
those
who
have
been
indignant
at
hearing
that
their
methods
are
obsolete
and
their
labours
vain
will
be
taught
by
experience
to
recognise
in
the
works
of
another
school
services
to
religion
more
momentous
than
those
which
they
themselves
have
aspired
to
perform
practice
will
compel
the
assent
which
is
denied
to
theory
and
men
will
learn
to
value
in
the
fruit
what
the
germ
did
not
reveal
to
them
therefore
it
is
to
the
prospect
of
that
development
of
catholic
learning
which
is
too
powerful
to
be
arrested
or
repressed
that
i
would
direct
the
thoughts
of
those
who
are
tempted
to
yield
either
to
a
malignant
joy
or
an
unjust
despondency
at
the
language
of
the
holy
see
if
the
spirit
of
the
and
foreign
really
animates
those
whose
sympathy
it
enjoyed
neither
their
principles
nor
their
confidence
nor
their
hopes
will
be
shaken
by
its
extinction
it
was
but
a
partial
and
temporary
embodiment
of
an
imperishable
idea
the
faint
reflection
of
a
light
which
still
lives
and
burns
in
the
hearts
of
the
silent
thinkers
of
the
church

xiv
the
vatican
council
the
intention
of
pius
ix
to
convene
a
general
council
became
known
in
the
autumn
of
shortly
before
the
appearance
of
the
syllabus
they
were
the
two
principal
measures
which
were
designed
to
restore
the
spiritual
and
temporal
power
of
the
holy
see
when
the
idea
of
the
council
was
first
put
forward
it
met
with
no
favour
the
french
bishops
discouraged
it
and
the
french
bishops
holding
the
talisman
of
the
occupying
army
spoke
with
authority
later
on
when
the
position
had
been
altered
by
the
impulse
which
the
syllabus
gave
to
the
ultramontane
opinions
they
revived
the
scheme
they
had
first
opposed
those
who
felt
their
influence
injured
by
the
change
persuaded
themselves
that
the
court
of
rome
was
more
prudent
than
some
of
its
partisans
and
that
the
episcopate
was
less
given
to
extremes
than
the
priesthood
and
laity
they
conceived
the
hope
that
an
assembly
of
bishops
would
curb
the
intemperance
of
a
zeal
which
was
largely
directed
against
their
own
order
and
would
authentically
sanction
such
an
exposition
of
catholic
ideas
as
would
reconcile
the
animosity
that
feeds
on
things
spoken
in
the
heat
of
controversy
and
on
the
errors
of
incompetent
apologists
they
had
accepted
the
syllabus
but
they
wished
to
obtain
canonicity
for
their
own
interpretation
of
it
if
those
who
had
succeeded
in
assigning
an
acceptable
meaning
to
its
censures
could
appear
in
a
body
to
plead
their
cause
before
the
pope
the
pretensions
which
compromised
the
church
might
be
permanently
repressed
once
during
the
struggle
for
the
temporal
power
the
question
was
pertinently
asked
how
it
was
that
men
so
perspicacious
and
so
enlightened
as
those
who
were
its
most
conspicuous
champions
could
bring
themselves
to
justify
a
system
of
government
which
their
own
principles
condemned
the
explanation
then
given
was
that
they
were
making
a
sacrifice
which
would
be
compensated
hereafter
that
those
who
succoured
the
pope
in
his
utmost
need
were
establishing
a
claim
which
would
make
them
irresistible
in
better
times
when
they
should
demand
great
acts
of
conciliation
and
reform
it
appeared
to
these
men
that
the
time
had
come
to
reap
the
harvest
they
had
arduously
sown
the
council
did
not
originate
in
the
desire
to
exalt
beyond
measure
the
cause
of
rome
it
was
proposed
in
the
interest
of
moderation
and
the
bishop
of
orleans
was
one
of
those
who
took
the
lead
in
promoting
it
the
cardinals
were
consulted
and
pronounced
against
it
the
pope
overruled
their
resistance
whatever
embarrassments
might
be
in
store
and
however
difficult
the
enterprise
it
was
clear
that
it
would
evoke
a
force
capable
of
accomplishing
infinite
good
for
religion
it
was
an
instrument
of
unknown
power
that
inspired
little
confidence
but
awakened
vague
hopes
of
relief
for
the
ills
of
society
and
the
divisions
of
christendom
the
guardians
of
immovable
traditions
and
the
leaders
of
progress
in
religious
knowledge
were
not
to
share
in
the
work
the
schism
of
the
east
was
widened
by
the
angry
quarrel
between
russia
and
the
pope
and
the
letter
to
the
protestants
whose
orders
are
not
recognised
at
rome
could
not
be
more
than
a
ceremonious
challenge
there
was
no
promise
of
sympathy
in
these
invitations
or
in
the
answers
they
provoked
but
the
belief
spread
to
many
schools
of
thought
and
was
held
by
pusey
and
by
dean
stanley
by
professor
hase
and
by
guizot
that
the
auspicious
issue
of
the
council
was
an
object
of
vital
care
to
all
denominations
of
christian
men
the
council
of
trent
impressed
on
the
church
the
stamp
of
an
intolerant
age
and
perpetuated
by
its
decrees
the
spirit
of
an
austere
immorality
the
ideas
embodied
in
the
roman
inquisition
became
characteristic
of
a
system
which
obeyed
expediency
by
submitting
to
indefinite
modification
but
underwent
no
change
of
principle
three
centuries
have
so
changed
the
world
that
the
maxims
with
which
the
church
resisted
the
reformation
have
become
her
weakness
and
her
reproach
and
that
which
arrested
her
decline
now
arrests
her
progress
to
break
effectually
with
that
tradition
and
eradicate
its
influence
nothing
less
is
required
than
an
authority
equal
to
that
by
which
it
was
imposed
the
vatican
council
was
the
first
sufficient
occasion
which
catholicism
had
enjoyed
to
reform
remodel
and
adapt
the
work
of
trent
this
idea
was
present
among
the
motives
which
caused
it
to
be
summoned
it
was
apparent
that
two
systems
which
can
not
be
reconciled
were
about
to
contend
at
the
council
but
the
extent
and
force
of
the
reforming
spirit
were
unknown
seventeen
questions
submitted
by
the
holy
see
to
the
bishops
in
concerned
matters
of
discipline
the
regulation
of
marriage
and
education
the
policy
of
encouraging
new
monastic
orders
and
the
means
of
making
the
parochial
clergy
more
dependent
on
the
bishops
they
gave
no
indication
of
the
deeper
motives
of
the
time
in
the
midst
of
many
trivial
proposals
the
leading
objects
of
reform
grew
more
defined
as
the
time
approached
and
men
became
conscious
of
distinct
purposes
based
on
a
consistent
notion
of
the
church
they
received
systematic
expression
from
a
bohemian
priest
whose
work
reform
of
the
church
in
its
head
and
is
founded
on
practical
experience
not
only
on
literary
theory
and
is
the
most
important
manifesto
of
these
ideas
the
author
exhorts
the
council
to
restrict
centralisation
to
reduce
the
office
of
the
holy
see
to
the
ancient
limits
of
its
primacy
to
restore
to
the
episcopate
the
prerogatives
which
have
been
confiscated
by
rome
to
abolish
the
temporal
government
which
is
the
prop
of
hierarchical
despotism
to
revise
the
matrimonial
discipline
to
suppress
many
religious
orders
and
the
solemn
vows
for
all
to
modify
the
absolute
rule
of
celibacy
for
the
clergy
to
admit
the
use
of
the
vernacular
in
the
liturgy
to
allow
a
larger
share
to
the
laity
in
the
management
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
to
encourage
the
education
of
the
clergy
at
universities
and
to
renounce
the
claims
of
mediæval
theocracy
which
are
fruitful
of
suspicion
between
church
and
state
many
catholics
in
many
countries
concurred
in
great
part
of
this
programme
but
it
was
not
the
symbol
of
a
connected
party
few
agreed
with
the
author
in
all
parts
of
his
ideal
church
or
did
not
think
that
he
had
omitted
essential
points
among
the
inveterate
abuses
which
the
council
of
trent
failed
to
extirpate
was
the
very
one
which
gave
the
first
impulse
to
lutheranism
the
belief
is
still
retained
in
the
superficial
catholicism
of
southern
europe
that
the
pope
can
release
the
dead
from
purgatory
and
money
is
obtained
at
rome
on
the
assurance
that
every
mass
said
at
a
particular
altar
opens
heaven
to
the
soul
for
which
it
is
offered
up
on
the
other
hand
the
index
of
prohibited
books
is
an
institution
of
tridentine
origin
which
has
become
so
unwieldy
and
opprobrious
that
even
men
of
strong
roman
sympathies
like
the
bishops
of
würzburg
and
pölten
recommended
its
reform
in
france
it
was
thought
that
the
government
would
surrender
the
organic
articles
if
the
rights
of
the
bishops
and
the
clergy
were
made
secure
under
the
canon
law
if
national
and
diocesan
synods
were
introduced
and
if
a
proportionate
share
was
given
to
catholic
countries
in
the
sacred
college
and
the
roman
congregations
the
aspiration
in
which
all
the
advocates
of
reform
seemed
to
unite
was
that
those
customs
should
be
changed
which
are
connected
with
arbitrary
power
in
the
church
and
all
the
interests
threatened
by
this
movement
combined
in
the
endeavour
to
maintain
intact
the
papal
prerogative
to
proclaim
the
pope
infallible
was
their
compendious
security
against
hostile
states
and
churches
against
human
liberty
and
authority
against
disintegrating
tolerance
and
rationalising
science
against
error
and
sin
it
became
the
common
refuge
of
those
who
shunned
what
was
called
the
liberal
influence
in
catholicism
pius
ix
constantly
asserted
that
the
desire
of
obtaining
the
recognition
of
papal
infallibility
was
not
originally
his
motive
in
convoking
the
council
he
did
not
require
that
a
privilege
which
was
practically
undisputed
should
be
further
defined
the
bishops
especially
those
of
the
minority
were
never
tired
of
saying
that
the
catholic
world
honoured
and
obeyed
the
pope
as
it
had
never
done
before
virtually
he
had
exerted
all
the
authority
which
the
dogma
could
confer
on
him
in
his
first
important
utterance
the
encyclical
of
november
he
announced
that
he
was
infallible
and
the
claim
raised
no
commotion
later
on
he
applied
a
more
decisive
test
and
gained
a
more
complete
success
when
the
bishops
summoned
to
rome
not
as
a
council
but
as
an
audience
received
from
him
an
additional
article
of
their
faith
but
apart
from
the
dogma
of
infallibility
he
had
a
strong
desire
to
establish
certain
cherished
opinions
of
his
own
on
a
basis
firm
enough
to
outlast
his
time
they
were
collected
in
the
syllabus
which
contained
the
essence
of
what
he
had
written
during
many
years
and
was
an
abridgment
of
the
lessons
which
his
life
had
taught
him
he
was
anxious
that
they
should
not
be
lost
they
were
part
of
a
coherent
system
the
syllabus
was
not
rejected
but
its
edge
was
blunted
and
its
point
broken
by
the
zeal
which
was
spent
in
explaining
it
away
and
the
pope
feared
that
it
would
be
contested
if
he
repudiated
the
soothing
interpretations
in
private
he
said
that
he
wished
to
have
no
interpreter
but
himself
while
the
jesuit
preachers
proclaimed
that
the
syllabus
bore
the
full
sanction
of
infallibility
higher
functionaries
of
the
court
pointed
out
that
it
was
an
informal
document
without
definite
official
value
probably
the
pope
would
have
been
content
that
these
his
favourite
ideas
should
be
rescued
from
evasion
by
being
incorporated
in
the
canons
of
the
council
papal
infallibility
was
implied
rather
than
included
among
them
whilst
the
authority
of
his
acts
was
not
resisted
he
was
not
eager
to
disparage
his
right
by
exposing
the
need
of
a
more
exact
definition
the
opinions
which
pius
ix
was
anxiously
promoting
were
not
the
mere
fruit
of
his
private
meditations
they
belonged
to
the
doctrines
of
a
great
party
which
was
busily
pursuing
its
own
objects
and
had
not
been
always
the
party
of
the
pope
in
the
days
of
his
trouble
he
had
employed
an
advocate
and
the
advocate
had
absorbed
the
client
during
his
exile
a
jesuit
had
asked
his
approbation
for
a
review
to
be
conducted
by
the
best
talents
of
the
order
and
to
be
devoted
to
the
papal
cause
and
he
had
warmly
embraced
the
idea
less
it
should
seem
as
a
prince
than
as
a
divine
there
were
his
sovereign
rights
to
maintain
but
there
was
also
a
doctrinaire
interest
there
were
reminiscences
of
study
as
well
as
practical
objects
that
recommended
the
project
in
these
personal
views
the
pope
was
not
quite
consistent
he
had
made
himself
the
idol
of
italian
patriots
and
of
the
liberal
french
catholics
he
had
set
theiner
to
vindicate
the
suppresser
of
the
jesuits
and
rosmini
the
most
enlightened
priest
in
italy
had
been
his
trusted
friend
after
his
restoration
he
submitted
to
other
influences
and
the
writers
of
the
which
followed
him
to
rome
and
became
his
acknowledged
organ
acquired
power
over
his
mind
these
men
were
not
identified
with
their
order
their
general
roothan
had
disliked
the
plan
of
the
review
foreseeing
that
the
society
would
be
held
responsible
for
writings
which
it
did
not
approve
and
would
forfeit
the
flexibility
in
adapting
itself
to
the
moods
of
different
countries
which
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
its
prosperity
the
pope
arranged
the
matter
by
taking
the
writers
under
his
own
protection
and
giving
to
them
a
sort
of
exemption
and
partial
immunity
under
the
rule
of
their
order
they
are
set
apart
from
other
jesuits
they
are
assisted
and
supplied
from
the
literary
resources
of
the
order
and
are
animated
more
than
any
of
its
other
writers
by
its
genuine
and
characteristic
spirit
but
they
act
on
their
own
judgment
under
the
guidance
of
the
pope
and
are
a
bodyguard
told
off
from
the
army
for
the
personal
protection
of
the
sovereign
it
is
their
easy
function
to
fuse
into
one
system
the
interests
and
ideas
of
the
pope
and
those
of
their
society
the
result
has
been
not
to
weaken
by
compromise
and
accommodation
but
to
intensify
both
the
prudence
and
sagacity
which
are
sustained
in
the
government
of
the
jesuits
by
their
complicated
checks
on
power
and
their
consideration
for
the
interests
of
the
order
under
many
various
conditions
do
not
always
restrain
men
who
are
partially
emancipated
from
its
rigorous
discipline
and
subject
to
a
more
capricious
rule
they
were
chosen
in
their
capacity
as
jesuits
for
the
sake
of
the
peculiar
spirit
which
their
system
develops
the
pope
appointed
them
on
account
of
that
devotion
to
himself
which
is
a
quality
of
the
order
and
relieved
them
from
some
of
the
restraints
which
it
imposes
he
wished
for
something
more
papal
than
other
jesuits
and
he
himself
became
more
subject
to
the
jesuits
than
other
pontiffs
he
made
them
a
channel
of
his
influence
and
became
an
instrument
of
their
own
the
jesuits
had
continued
to
gain
ground
in
rome
ever
since
the
return
they
had
suffered
more
than
others
in
the
revolution
that
dethroned
him
and
they
had
their
reward
in
the
restoration
they
had
long
been
held
in
check
by
the
dominicans
but
the
theology
of
the
dominicans
had
been
discountenanced
and
their
spirit
broken
in
when
a
doctrine
which
they
had
contested
for
centuries
was
proclaimed
a
dogma
of
faith
in
the
strife
for
the
pope
temporal
dominion
the
jesuits
were
most
zealous
and
they
were
busy
in
the
preparation
and
in
the
defence
of
the
syllabus
they
were
connected
with
every
measure
for
which
the
pope
most
cared
and
their
divines
became
the
oracles
of
the
roman
congregations
the
papal
infallibility
had
been
always
their
favourite
doctrine
its
adoption
by
the
council
promised
to
give
to
their
theology
official
warrant
and
to
their
order
the
supremacy
in
the
church
they
were
now
in
power
and
they
snatched
their
opportunity
when
the
council
was
convoked
efforts
to
establish
this
doctrine
had
been
going
on
for
years
the
dogmatic
decree
of
involved
it
so
distinctly
that
its
formal
recognition
seemed
to
be
only
a
question
of
time
and
zeal
people
even
said
that
it
was
the
real
object
of
that
decree
to
create
a
precedent
which
should
make
it
impossible
afterwards
to
deny
papal
infallibility
the
catechisms
were
altered
or
new
ones
were
substituted
in
which
it
was
taught
after
the
doctrine
began
to
show
itself
in
the
acts
of
provincial
synods
and
it
was
afterwards
supposed
that
the
bishops
of
those
provinces
were
committed
to
it
one
of
these
synods
was
held
at
cologne
and
three
surviving
members
were
in
the
council
at
rome
of
whom
two
were
in
the
minority
and
the
third
had
continued
in
his
writings
to
oppose
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
after
it
had
found
its
way
into
the
cologne
decree
the
suspicion
that
the
acts
had
been
tampered
with
is
suggested
by
what
passed
at
the
synod
of
baltimore
in
the
archbishop
of
louis
signed
the
acts
of
that
synod
under
protest
and
after
obtaining
a
pledge
that
his
protest
would
be
inserted
by
the
apostolic
delegate
the
pledge
was
not
kept
i
complain
writes
the
archbishop
that
the
promise
which
had
been
given
was
broken
the
acts
ought
to
have
been
published
in
their
integrity
or
not
at
all
this
process
was
carried
on
so
boldly
that
men
understood
what
was
to
come
protestants
foretold
that
the
catholics
would
not
rest
until
the
pope
was
formally
declared
infallible
and
a
prelate
returning
from
the
meeting
of
bishops
at
rome
in
was
startled
at
being
asked
by
a
friend
whether
infallibility
had
not
been
brought
forward
it
was
produced
not
then
but
at
the
next
great
meeting
in
the
council
had
been
announced
and
the
bishops
wished
to
present
an
address
to
the
pope
haynald
archbishop
of
colocza
held
the
pen
assisted
by
franchi
one
of
the
clever
roman
prelates
and
by
some
bishops
among
whom
were
the
archbishop
of
westminster
and
the
bishop
of
orleans
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
the
papal
infallibility
acknowledged
in
the
address
several
bishops
declared
that
they
could
not
show
themselves
in
their
dioceses
if
they
came
back
without
having
done
anything
for
that
doctrine
they
were
resisted
in
a
way
which
made
them
complain
that
its
very
name
irritated
the
french
haynald
refused
their
demand
but
agreed
to
insert
the
words
of
the
council
of
florence
and
the
bishops
did
not
go
away
a
few
days
before
this
attempt
was
made
the
had
begun
to
agitate
by
proposing
that
catholics
should
bind
themselves
to
die
if
need
be
for
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
and
the
article
was
printed
on
a
separate
sheet
bearing
the
papal
and
distributed
widely
the
check
administered
by
haynald
and
his
colleagues
brought
about
a
lull
in
the
movement
but
the
french
bishops
had
taken
alarm
and
maret
the
most
learned
of
them
set
about
the
preparation
of
his
book
during
the
winter
of
several
commissions
were
created
in
rome
to
make
ready
the
materials
for
the
council
the
dogmatic
commission
included
the
jesuits
perrone
schrader
and
franzelin
the
question
of
infallibility
was
proposed
to
it
by
cardoni
archbishop
of
edessa
in
a
dissertation
which
having
been
revised
was
afterwards
published
and
accepted
by
the
leading
roman
divines
as
an
adequate
exposition
of
their
case
the
dogma
was
approved
unanimously
with
the
exception
of
one
vote
alzog
of
freiberg
being
the
only
dissentient
when
the
other
german
divines
who
were
in
rome
learned
the
scheme
that
was
on
foot
in
the
dogmatic
commission
they
resolved
to
protest
but
were
prevented
by
some
of
their
colleagues
they
gave
the
alarm
in
germany
the
intention
to
proclaim
infallibility
at
the
council
was
no
longer
a
secret
the
first
bishop
who
made
the
wish
public
was
fessler
of
pölten
his
language
was
guarded
and
he
only
prepared
his
readers
for
a
probable
contingency
but
he
was
soon
followed
by
the
bishop
of
nîmes
who
thought
the
discussion
of
the
dogma
superfluous
and
foreshadowed
a
vote
by
acclamation
the
on
the
of
february
gave
utterance
to
the
hope
that
the
council
would
not
hesitate
to
proclaim
the
dogma
and
confirm
the
syllabus
in
less
than
a
month
five
days
later
the
pope
wrote
to
some
venetians
who
had
taken
a
vow
to
uphold
his
infallibility
encouraging
their
noble
resolution
to
defend
his
supreme
authority
and
all
his
rights
until
the
month
of
may
cardinal
antonelli
confidential
language
to
diplomatists
was
that
the
dogma
was
to
be
proclaimed
and
that
it
would
encounter
no
difficulty
cardinal
reisach
was
to
have
been
the
president
of
the
council
as
archbishop
of
munich
he
had
allowed
himself
and
his
diocese
to
be
governed
by
the
ablest
of
all
the
ultramontane
divines
during
his
long
residence
in
rome
he
rose
to
high
estimation
because
he
was
reputed
to
possess
the
secret
and
to
have
discovered
the
vanity
of
german
science
he
had
amused
himself
with
christian
antiquities
and
his
friendship
for
the
great
explorer
de
rossi
brought
him
for
a
time
under
suspicion
of
liberality
but
later
he
became
unrelenting
in
his
ardour
for
the
objects
of
the
and
regained
the
confidence
of
the
pope
the
german
bishops
complained
that
he
betrayed
their
interests
and
that
their
church
had
suffered
mischief
from
his
paramount
influence
but
in
rome
his
easy
temper
and
affable
manners
made
him
friends
and
the
court
knew
that
there
was
no
cardinal
on
whom
it
was
so
safe
to
rely
fessler
the
first
bishop
who
gave
the
signal
of
the
intended
definition
was
appointed
secretary
he
was
esteemed
a
learned
man
in
austria
and
he
was
wisely
chosen
to
dispel
the
suspicion
that
the
conduct
of
the
council
was
to
be
jealously
retained
in
roman
hands
and
to
prove
that
there
are
qualities
by
which
the
confidence
of
the
court
could
be
won
by
men
of
a
less
favoured
nation
besides
the
president
and
secretary
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
pope
theological
advisers
was
a
german
at
the
time
when
passaglia
reputation
was
great
in
rome
his
companion
clement
schrader
shared
the
fame
of
his
solid
erudition
when
passaglia
fell
into
disgrace
his
friend
smote
him
with
reproaches
and
intimated
the
belief
that
he
would
follow
the
footsteps
of
luther
and
debauch
a
nun
schrader
is
the
most
candid
and
consistent
asserter
of
the
papal
claims
he
does
not
shrink
from
the
consequences
of
the
persecuting
theory
and
he
has
given
the
most
authentic
and
unvarnished
exposition
of
the
syllabus
he
was
the
first
who
spoke
out
openly
what
others
were
variously
attempting
to
compromise
or
to
conceal
while
the
paris
jesuits
got
into
trouble
for
extenuating
the
roman
doctrine
and
had
to
be
kept
up
to
the
mark
by
an
abbé
who
reminded
them
that
the
pope
as
a
physical
person
and
without
of
the
episcopate
is
infallible
schrader
proclaimed
that
his
will
is
supreme
even
against
the
joint
and
several
opinions
of
the
bishops
when
the
proceedings
of
the
dogmatic
commission
the
acts
of
the
pope
and
the
language
of
french
and
austrian
bishops
and
of
the
press
serving
the
interests
of
rome
announced
that
the
proclamation
of
infallibility
had
ceased
to
be
merely
the
aspiration
of
a
party
and
was
the
object
of
a
design
deliberately
set
on
foot
by
those
to
whom
the
preparation
and
management
of
the
council
pertained
men
became
aware
that
an
extraordinary
crisis
was
impending
and
that
they
needed
to
make
themselves
familiar
with
an
unforeseen
problem
the
sense
of
its
gravity
made
slow
progress
the
persuasion
was
strong
among
divines
that
the
episcopate
would
not
surrender
to
a
party
which
was
odious
to
many
of
them
and
politicians
were
reluctant
to
believe
that
schemes
were
ripening
such
as
fessler
described
schemes
intended
to
alter
the
relations
between
church
and
state
when
the
entire
plan
was
made
public
by
the
in
march
many
refused
to
be
convinced
it
happened
that
a
statesman
was
in
office
who
had
occasion
to
know
that
the
information
was
accurate
the
prime
minister
of
bavaria
prince
hohenlohe
was
the
brother
of
a
cardinal
the
university
of
munich
was
represented
on
the
roman
commissions
by
an
illustrious
scholar
and
the
news
of
the
thing
that
was
preparing
came
through
trustworthy
channels
on
the
of
april
prince
hohenlohe
sent
out
a
diplomatic
circular
on
the
subject
of
the
council
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
called
into
existence
by
any
purely
theological
emergency
and
that
the
one
dogma
which
was
to
be
brought
before
it
involved
all
those
claims
which
cause
collisions
between
church
and
state
and
threaten
the
liberty
and
the
security
of
governments
of
the
five
roman
commissions
one
was
appointed
for
the
express
purpose
of
dealing
with
the
mixed
topics
common
to
religion
and
to
politics
besides
infallibility
and
politics
the
council
was
to
be
occupied
with
the
syllabus
which
is
in
part
directed
against
maxims
of
state
the
avowed
purpose
of
the
council
being
so
largely
political
the
governments
could
not
remain
indifferent
to
its
action
lest
they
should
be
driven
afterwards
to
adopt
measures
which
would
be
hostile
it
would
be
better
at
once
to
seek
an
understanding
by
friendly
means
and
to
obtain
assurance
that
all
irritating
deliberations
should
be
avoided
and
no
business
touching
the
state
transacted
except
in
presence
of
its
representatives
he
proposed
that
the
governments
should
hold
a
conference
to
arrange
a
plan
for
the
protection
of
their
common
interest
important
measures
proposed
by
small
states
are
subject
to
suspicion
of
being
prompted
by
a
greater
power
prince
hohenlohe
as
a
friend
of
the
prussian
alliance
was
supposed
to
be
acting
in
this
matter
in
concert
with
berlin
this
good
understanding
was
suspected
at
vienna
for
the
austrian
chancellor
was
more
conspicuous
as
an
enemy
of
prussia
than
hohenlohe
as
a
friend
count
beust
traced
the
influence
of
count
bismarck
in
the
bavarian
circular
he
replied
on
behalf
of
the
catholic
empire
of
austria
that
there
were
no
grounds
to
impute
political
objects
to
the
council
and
that
repression
and
not
prevention
was
the
only
policy
compatible
with
free
institutions
after
the
refusal
of
austria
the
idea
of
a
conference
was
dismissed
by
the
other
powers
and
the
first
of
the
storm
clouds
that
darkened
the
horizon
of
infallibility
passed
without
breaking
although
united
action
was
abandoned
the
idea
of
sending
ambassadors
to
the
council
still
offered
the
most
inoffensive
and
amicable
means
of
preventing
the
danger
of
subsequent
conflict
its
policy
or
impolicy
was
a
question
to
be
decided
by
france
several
bishops
and
cardinal
bonnechose
among
the
rest
urged
the
government
to
resume
its
ancient
privilege
and
send
a
representative
but
two
powerful
parties
united
in
nothing
else
agreed
in
demanding
absolute
neutrality
the
democracy
wished
that
no
impediment
should
be
put
in
the
way
of
an
enterprise
which
promised
to
sever
the
connection
of
the
state
with
the
church
ollivier
set
forth
this
opinion
in
july
in
a
speech
which
was
to
serve
him
in
his
candidature
for
office
and
in
the
autumn
of
it
was
certain
that
he
would
soon
be
in
power
the
ministers
could
not
insist
on
being
admitted
to
the
council
where
they
were
not
invited
without
making
a
violent
demonstration
in
a
direction
they
knew
would
not
be
followed
the
ultramontanes
were
even
more
eager
than
their
enemies
to
exclude
an
influence
that
might
embarrass
their
policy
the
archbishop
of
paris
by
giving
the
same
advice
settled
the
question
he
probably
reckoned
on
his
own
power
of
mediating
between
france
and
rome
the
french
court
long
imagined
that
the
dogma
would
be
set
aside
and
that
the
mass
of
the
french
bishops
opposed
it
at
last
they
perceived
that
they
were
mistaken
and
the
emperor
said
to
cardinal
bonnechose
you
are
going
to
give
your
signature
to
decrees
already
made
he
ascertained
the
names
of
the
bishops
who
would
resist
and
it
was
known
that
he
was
anxious
for
their
success
but
he
was
resolved
that
it
should
be
gained
by
them
and
not
by
the
pressure
of
his
diplomacy
at
the
cost
of
displeasing
the
pope
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
his
chief
secretary
were
counted
by
the
court
of
rome
among
its
friends
and
the
ordinary
ambassador
started
for
his
post
with
instructions
to
conciliate
and
to
run
no
risk
of
a
quarrel
he
arrived
at
rome
believing
that
there
would
be
a
speculative
conflict
between
the
extremes
of
roman
and
german
theology
which
would
admit
of
being
reconciled
by
the
safer
and
more
sober
wisdom
of
the
french
bishops
backed
by
an
impartial
embassy
his
credulity
was
an
encumbrance
to
the
cause
which
it
was
his
mission
and
his
wish
to
serve
in
germany
the
plan
of
penetrating
the
council
with
lay
influence
took
a
strange
form
it
was
proposed
that
the
german
catholics
should
be
represented
by
king
john
of
saxony
as
a
catholic
and
a
scholar
who
had
shown
in
his
commentary
on
dante
that
he
had
read
thomas
and
as
a
prince
personally
esteemed
by
the
pope
it
was
conceived
that
his
presence
would
be
a
salutary
restraint
it
was
an
impracticable
idea
but
letters
which
reached
rome
during
the
winter
raised
an
impression
that
the
king
regretted
that
he
could
not
be
there
the
opinion
of
germany
would
still
have
some
weight
if
the
north
and
south
which
included
more
than
thirteen
millions
of
catholics
worked
together
it
was
the
policy
of
hohenlohe
to
use
this
united
force
and
the
ultramontanes
learned
to
regard
him
as
a
very
formidable
antagonist
when
their
first
great
triumph
in
the
election
of
the
commission
on
doctrine
was
accomplished
the
commentary
of
a
roman
prelate
was
che
colpo
per
il
principe
hohenlohe
the
bavarian
envoy
in
rome
did
not
share
the
views
of
his
chief
and
he
was
recalled
in
november
his
successor
had
capacity
to
carry
out
the
known
policy
of
the
prince
but
early
in
the
winter
the
ultramontanes
drove
hohenlohe
from
office
and
their
victory
though
it
was
exercised
with
moderation
and
was
not
followed
by
a
total
change
of
policy
neutralised
the
influence
of
bavaria
in
the
council
the
fall
of
hohenlohe
and
the
abstention
of
france
hampered
the
federal
government
of
northern
germany
for
its
catholic
subjects
and
ultimately
in
view
of
the
rivalry
with
france
to
retain
the
friendship
of
the
papacy
is
a
fixed
maxim
at
berlin
count
bismarck
laid
down
the
rule
that
prussia
should
display
no
definite
purpose
in
a
cause
which
was
not
her
own
but
should
studiously
keep
abreast
of
the
north
german
bishops
those
bishops
neither
invoked
nor
by
their
conduct
invited
the
of
the
state
and
its
influence
would
have
been
banished
from
the
council
but
for
the
minister
who
represented
it
in
rome
the
vicissitudes
of
a
general
council
are
so
far
removed
from
the
normal
experience
of
statesmen
that
they
could
not
well
be
studied
or
acted
upon
from
a
distance
a
government
that
strictly
controlled
and
dictated
the
conduct
of
its
envoy
was
sure
to
go
wrong
and
to
frustrate
action
by
theory
a
government
that
trusted
the
advice
of
its
minister
present
on
the
spot
enjoyed
a
great
advantage
baron
arnim
was
favourably
situated
a
catholic
belonging
to
any
but
the
ultramontane
school
would
have
been
less
willingly
listened
to
in
rome
than
a
protestant
who
was
a
conservative
in
politics
and
whose
regard
for
the
interests
of
religion
was
so
undamaged
by
the
sectarian
taint
that
he
was
known
to
be
sincere
in
the
wish
that
catholics
should
have
cause
to
rejoice
in
the
prosperity
of
their
church
the
apathy
of
austria
and
the
vacillation
of
france
contributed
to
his
influence
for
he
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
bishops
from
both
countries
and
he
was
able
to
guide
his
own
government
in
its
course
towards
the
council
the
english
government
was
content
to
learn
more
and
to
speak
less
than
the
other
powers
at
rome
the
usual
distrust
of
the
roman
court
towards
a
liberal
ministry
in
england
was
increased
at
the
moment
by
the
measure
which
the
catholics
had
desired
and
applauded
it
seemed
improbable
to
men
more
solicitous
for
acquired
rights
than
for
general
political
principle
that
protestant
statesmen
who
disestablished
their
own
church
could
feel
a
very
sincere
interest
in
the
welfare
of
another
ministers
so
utopian
as
to
give
up
solid
goods
for
an
imaginary
righteousness
seemed
as
practical
advisers
open
to
grave
suspicion
gladstone
was
feared
as
the
apostle
of
those
doctrines
to
which
rome
owes
many
losses
public
opinion
in
england
was
not
prepared
to
look
on
papal
infallibility
as
a
matter
of
national
concern
more
than
other
dogmas
which
make
enemies
to
catholicism
even
if
the
government
could
have
admitted
the
prussian
maxim
of
keeping
in
line
with
the
bishops
it
would
have
accomplished
nothing
the
english
bishops
were
divided
but
the
irish
bishops
who
are
the
natural
foes
of
the
fenian
plot
were
by
an
immense
majority
on
the
ultramontane
side
there
was
almost
an
ostentation
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
influence
the
bishops
or
the
court
of
rome
when
at
length
england
publicly
concurred
in
the
remonstrances
of
france
events
had
happened
which
showed
that
the
council
was
raising
up
dangers
for
both
catholic
and
liberal
interests
it
was
a
result
so
easy
to
foresee
that
the
government
had
made
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
its
extreme
reserve
was
not
due
to
indifference
the
lesser
catholic
powers
were
almost
unrepresented
in
rome
the
government
of
the
regent
of
spain
possessed
no
moral
authority
over
bishops
appointed
by
the
queen
and
the
revolution
had
proved
so
hostile
to
the
clergy
that
they
were
forced
to
depend
on
the
pope
diplomatic
relations
being
interrupted
there
was
nothing
to
restrain
them
from
seeking
favour
by
unqualified
obedience
portugal
had
appointed
the
count
de
lavradio
ambassador
to
the
council
but
when
he
found
that
he
was
alone
he
retained
only
the
character
of
envoy
to
the
holy
see
he
had
weight
with
the
small
group
of
portuguese
bishops
but
he
died
before
he
could
be
of
use
and
they
drifted
into
submission
belgium
was
governed
by
frère
orban
one
of
the
most
anxious
and
laborious
enemies
of
the
hierarchy
who
had
no
inducement
to
interfere
with
an
event
which
justified
his
enmity
and
was
moreover
the
unanimous
wish
of
the
belgian
episcopate
when
protestant
and
catholic
powers
joined
in
exhorting
rome
to
moderation
belgium
was
left
out
russia
was
the
only
power
that
treated
the
church
with
actual
hostility
during
the
council
and
calculated
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
decrees
which
would
intensify
the
schism
italy
was
more
deeply
interested
in
the
events
at
rome
than
any
other
nation
the
hostility
of
the
clergy
was
felt
both
in
the
political
and
financial
difficulties
of
the
kingdom
and
the
prospect
of
conciliation
would
suffer
equally
from
decrees
confirming
the
roman
claims
or
from
an
invidious
interposition
of
the
state
public
opinion
watched
the
preparations
for
the
council
with
frivolous
disdain
but
the
course
to
be
taken
was
carefully
considered
by
the
menabrea
cabinet
the
laws
still
subsisted
which
enabled
the
state
to
interfere
in
religious
affairs
and
the
government
was
legally
entitled
to
prohibit
the
attendance
of
the
bishops
at
the
council
or
to
recall
them
from
it
the
confiscated
church
property
was
retained
by
the
state
and
the
claims
of
the
episcopate
were
not
yet
settled
more
than
one
hundred
votes
on
which
rome
counted
belonged
to
italian
subjects
the
means
of
applying
administrative
pressure
were
therefore
great
though
diplomatic
action
was
impossible
the
piedmontese
wished
that
the
resources
of
their
ecclesiastical
jurisprudence
should
be
set
in
motion
but
minghetti
who
had
lately
joined
the
ministry
warmly
advocated
the
opinion
that
the
supreme
principle
of
the
liberty
of
the
church
ought
to
override
the
remains
of
the
older
legislation
in
a
state
consistently
free
and
with
the
disposition
of
the
italians
to
confound
catholicism
with
the
hierarchy
the
policy
of
abstention
was
a
triumph
of
liberality
the
idea
of
prince
hohenlohe
that
religion
ought
to
be
maintained
in
its
integrity
and
not
only
in
its
independence
that
society
is
interested
in
protecting
the
church
even
against
herself
and
that
the
enemies
of
her
liberty
are
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
political
could
find
no
favour
in
italy
during
the
session
of
menabrea
gave
no
pledge
to
parliament
as
to
the
council
and
the
bishops
who
inquired
whether
they
would
be
allowed
to
attend
it
were
left
unanswered
until
october
menabrea
then
explained
in
a
circular
that
the
right
of
the
bishops
to
go
to
the
council
proceeded
from
the
liberty
of
conscience
and
was
not
conceded
under
the
old
privileges
of
the
crown
or
as
a
favour
that
could
imply
responsibility
for
what
was
to
be
done
if
the
church
was
molested
in
her
freedom
excuse
would
be
given
for
resisting
the
incorporation
of
rome
if
the
council
came
to
decisions
injurious
to
the
safety
of
states
it
would
be
attributed
to
the
unnatural
conditions
created
by
the
french
occupation
and
might
be
left
to
the
enlightened
judgment
of
catholics
it
was
proposed
that
the
fund
realised
by
the
sale
of
the
real
property
of
the
religious
corporations
should
be
administered
for
religious
purposes
by
local
boards
of
trustees
representing
the
catholic
population
and
that
the
state
should
abdicate
in
their
favour
its
ecclesiastical
patronage
and
proceed
to
discharge
the
unsettled
claims
of
the
clergy
so
great
a
change
in
the
plans
by
which
sella
and
rattazzi
had
impoverished
the
church
in
and
would
if
frankly
carried
into
execution
have
encouraged
an
independent
spirit
among
the
italian
bishops
and
the
reports
of
the
prefects
represented
about
thirty
of
them
as
being
favourable
to
conciliation
but
the
ministry
fell
in
november
and
was
succeeded
by
an
administration
whose
leading
members
lanza
and
sella
were
enemies
of
religion
the
court
of
rome
was
relieved
from
a
serious
peril
the
only
european
country
whose
influence
was
felt
in
the
attitude
of
its
bishops
was
one
whose
government
sent
out
no
diplomatists
while
the
austrian
chancellor
regarded
the
issue
of
the
council
with
a
profane
and
supercilious
eye
and
so
much
indifference
prevailed
at
vienna
that
it
was
said
that
the
ambassador
at
rome
did
not
read
the
decrees
and
that
count
beust
did
not
read
his
despatches
the
catholic
statesmen
in
hungary
were
intent
on
effecting
a
revolution
in
the
church
the
system
which
was
about
to
culminate
in
the
proclamation
of
infallibility
and
which
tended
to
absorb
all
power
from
the
circumference
into
the
centre
and
to
substitute
authority
for
autonomy
had
begun
at
the
lower
extremities
of
the
hierarchical
scale
the
laity
which
once
had
its
share
in
the
administration
of
church
property
and
in
the
deliberations
of
the
clergy
had
been
gradually
compelled
to
give
up
its
rights
to
the
priesthood
the
priests
to
the
bishops
and
the
bishops
to
the
pope
hungary
undertook
to
redress
the
process
and
to
correct
centralised
absolutism
by
in
a
memorandum
drawn
up
in
april
the
bishops
imputed
the
decay
of
religion
to
the
exclusion
of
the
people
from
the
management
of
all
church
affairs
and
proposed
that
whatever
is
not
purely
spiritual
should
be
conducted
by
mixed
boards
including
lay
representatives
elected
by
the
congregations
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
the
reaction
checked
this
design
and
the
concordat
threw
things
more
than
ever
into
clerical
hands
the
triumph
of
the
liberal
party
after
the
peace
of
prague
revived
the
movements
and
eötvös
called
on
the
bishops
to
devise
means
of
giving
to
the
laity
a
share
and
an
interest
in
religious
concerns
the
bishops
agreed
unanimously
to
the
proposal
of
deàk
that
the
laity
should
have
the
majority
in
the
boards
of
administration
and
the
new
constitution
of
the
hungarian
church
was
adopted
by
the
catholic
congress
on
the
of
october
and
approved
by
the
king
on
the
the
ruling
idea
of
this
great
measure
was
to
make
the
laity
supreme
in
all
that
is
not
liturgy
and
dogma
in
patronage
property
and
education
to
break
down
clerical
exclusiveness
and
government
control
to
deliver
the
people
from
the
usurpations
of
the
hierarchy
and
the
church
from
the
usurpations
of
the
state
it
was
an
attempt
to
reform
the
church
by
constitutional
principles
and
to
crush
ultramontanism
by
crushing
gallicanism
the
government
which
had
originated
the
scheme
was
ready
to
surrender
its
privileges
to
the
authorities
and
the
bishops
acted
in
harmony
with
the
ministers
and
with
public
opinion
whilst
this
good
understanding
lasted
and
while
the
bishops
were
engaged
in
applying
the
impartial
principles
of
at
home
there
was
a
strong
security
that
they
would
not
accept
decrees
that
would
undo
their
work
infallibility
would
not
only
condemn
their
system
but
destroy
their
position
as
the
winter
advanced
the
influence
of
these
things
became
apparent
the
ascendency
which
the
hungarian
bishops
acquired
from
the
beginning
was
due
to
other
causes
the
political
auspices
under
which
the
council
opened
were
very
favourable
to
the
papal
cause
the
promoters
of
infallibility
were
able
to
coin
resources
of
the
enmity
which
was
shown
to
the
church
the
danger
which
came
to
them
from
within
was
averted
the
policy
of
hohenlohe
which
was
afterwards
revived
by
daru
had
been
for
a
time
completely
abandoned
by
europe
the
battle
between
the
papal
and
the
episcopal
principle
could
come
off
undisturbed
in
closed
lists
political
opposition
there
was
none
but
the
council
had
to
be
governed
under
the
glare
of
inevitable
publicity
with
a
free
press
in
europe
and
hostile
views
prevalent
in
catholic
theology
the
causes
which
made
religious
science
utterly
powerless
in
the
strife
and
kept
it
from
grappling
with
the
forces
arrayed
against
it
are
of
deeper
import
than
the
issue
of
the
contest
itself
while
the
voice
of
the
bishops
grew
louder
in
praise
of
the
roman
designs
the
bavarian
government
consulted
the
universities
and
elicited
from
the
majority
of
the
munich
faculty
an
opinion
that
the
dogma
of
infallibility
would
be
attended
with
serious
danger
to
society
the
author
of
the
bohemian
pamphlet
affirmed
that
it
had
not
the
conditions
which
would
enable
it
ever
to
become
the
object
of
a
valid
definition
janus
compared
the
primacy
as
it
was
known
to
the
fathers
of
the
church
with
the
ultramontane
ideal
and
traced
the
process
of
transformation
through
a
long
series
of
forgeries
maret
published
his
book
some
weeks
after
janus
and
the
reform
it
had
been
revised
by
several
french
bishops
and
divines
and
was
to
serve
as
a
vindication
of
the
sorbonne
and
the
gallicans
and
as
the
manifesto
of
men
who
were
to
be
present
at
the
council
it
had
not
the
merit
of
novelty
or
the
fault
of
innovation
but
renewed
with
as
little
offence
as
possible
the
language
of
the
old
french
school
while
janus
treated
infallibility
as
the
critical
symptom
of
an
ancient
disease
maret
restricted
his
argument
to
what
was
directly
involved
in
the
defence
of
the
gallican
position
janus
held
that
the
doctrine
was
so
firmly
rooted
and
so
widely
supported
in
the
existing
constitution
of
the
church
that
much
must
be
modified
before
a
genuine
oecumenical
council
could
be
celebrated
maret
clung
to
the
belief
that
the
real
voice
of
the
church
would
make
itself
heard
at
the
vatican
in
direct
contradiction
with
janus
he
kept
before
him
the
one
practical
object
to
gain
assent
by
making
his
views
acceptable
even
to
the
unlearned
at
the
last
moment
a
tract
appeared
which
has
been
universally
attributed
to
döllinger
which
examined
the
evidences
relied
on
by
the
infallibilists
and
stated
briefly
the
case
against
them
it
pointed
to
the
inference
that
their
theory
is
not
merely
founded
on
an
illogical
and
uncritical
habit
but
on
unremitting
dishonesty
in
the
use
of
texts
this
was
coming
near
the
secret
of
the
whole
controversy
and
the
point
that
made
the
interference
of
the
powers
appear
the
only
availing
resource
for
the
sentiment
on
which
infallibility
is
founded
could
not
be
reached
by
argument
the
weapon
of
human
reason
but
resided
in
conclusions
transcending
evidence
and
was
the
inaccessible
postulate
rather
than
a
demonstrable
consequence
of
a
system
of
religious
faith
the
two
doctrines
opposed
but
never
met
each
other
it
was
as
much
an
instinct
of
the
ultramontane
theory
to
elude
the
tests
of
science
as
to
resist
the
control
of
states
its
opponents
baffled
and
perplexed
by
the
serene
vitality
of
a
view
which
was
impervious
to
proof
saw
want
of
principle
where
there
was
really
a
consistent
principle
and
blamed
the
ultramontane
divines
for
that
which
was
of
the
essence
of
ultramontane
divinity
how
it
came
that
no
appeal
to
revelation
or
tradition
to
reason
or
conscience
appeared
to
have
any
bearing
whatever
on
the
issue
is
a
mystery
which
janus
and
maret
and
döllinger
reflections
left
unexplained
the
resources
of
mediæval
learning
were
too
slender
to
preserve
an
authentic
record
of
the
growth
and
settlement
of
catholic
doctrine
many
writings
of
the
fathers
were
interpolated
others
were
unknown
and
spurious
matter
was
accepted
in
their
place
books
bearing
venerable
names
clement
dionysius
isidore
were
forged
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
authorities
for
opinions
that
lacked
the
sanction
of
antiquity
when
detection
came
and
it
was
found
that
fraud
had
been
employed
in
sustaining
doctrines
bound
up
with
the
peculiar
interests
of
rome
and
of
the
religious
orders
there
was
an
inducement
to
depreciate
the
evidences
of
antiquity
and
to
silence
a
voice
that
bore
obnoxious
testimony
the
notion
of
tradition
underwent
a
change
it
was
required
to
produce
what
it
had
not
preserved
the
fathers
had
spoken
of
the
unwritten
teaching
of
the
apostles
which
was
to
be
sought
in
the
churches
they
had
founded
of
esoteric
doctrines
and
views
which
must
be
of
apostolic
origin
because
they
are
universal
of
the
inspiration
of
general
councils
and
a
revelation
continued
beyond
the
new
testament
but
the
council
of
trent
resisted
the
conclusions
which
this
language
seemed
to
countenance
and
they
were
left
to
be
pursued
by
private
speculation
one
divine
deprecated
the
vain
pretence
of
arguing
from
scripture
by
which
luther
could
not
be
confuted
and
the
catholics
were
losing
ground
and
at
trent
a
speaker
averred
that
christian
doctrine
had
been
so
completely
determined
by
the
schoolmen
that
there
was
no
further
need
to
recur
to
scripture
this
idea
is
not
extinct
and
perrone
uses
it
to
explain
the
inferiority
of
catholics
as
biblical
critics
if
the
bible
is
inspired
says
peresius
still
more
must
its
interpretation
be
inspired
it
must
be
interpreted
variously
says
the
cardinal
of
cusa
according
to
necessity
a
change
in
the
opinion
of
the
church
implies
a
change
in
the
will
of
god
one
of
the
greatest
tridentine
divines
declares
that
a
doctrine
must
be
true
if
the
church
believes
it
without
any
warrant
from
scripture
according
to
petavius
the
general
belief
of
catholics
at
a
given
time
is
the
work
of
god
and
of
higher
authority
than
all
antiquity
and
all
the
fathers
scripture
may
be
silent
and
tradition
contradictory
but
the
church
is
independent
of
both
any
doctrine
which
catholic
divines
commonly
assert
without
proof
to
be
revealed
must
be
taken
as
revealed
the
testimony
of
rome
as
the
only
remaining
apostolic
church
is
equivalent
to
an
unbroken
chain
of
tradition
in
this
way
after
scripture
had
been
subjugated
tradition
itself
was
deposed
and
the
constant
belief
of
the
past
yielded
to
the
general
conviction
of
the
present
and
as
antiquity
had
given
way
to
universality
universality
made
way
for
authority
the
word
of
god
and
the
authority
of
the
church
came
to
be
declared
the
two
sources
of
religious
knowledge
divines
of
this
school
after
preferring
the
church
to
the
bible
preferred
the
modern
church
to
the
ancient
and
ended
by
sacrificing
both
to
the
pope
we
have
not
the
authority
of
scripture
wrote
prierias
in
his
defence
of
indulgences
but
we
have
the
higher
authority
of
the
roman
pontiffs
a
bishop
who
had
been
present
at
trent
confesses
that
in
matters
of
faith
he
would
believe
a
single
pope
rather
than
a
thousand
fathers
saints
and
doctors
the
divine
training
develops
an
orthodox
instinct
in
the
church
which
shows
itself
in
the
lives
of
devout
but
ignorant
men
more
than
in
the
researches
of
the
learned
and
teaches
authority
not
to
need
the
help
of
science
and
not
to
heed
its
opposition
all
the
arguments
by
which
theology
supports
a
doctrine
may
prove
to
be
false
without
diminishing
the
certainty
of
its
truth
the
church
has
not
obtained
and
is
not
bound
to
sustain
it
by
proof
she
is
supreme
over
fact
as
over
doctrine
as
fénelon
argues
because
she
is
the
supreme
expounder
of
tradition
which
is
a
chain
of
facts
accordingly
the
organ
of
one
ultramontane
bishop
lately
declared
that
infallibility
could
be
defined
without
arguments
and
the
bishop
of
nîmes
thought
that
the
decision
need
not
be
preceded
by
long
and
careful
discussion
the
dogmatic
commission
of
the
council
proclaims
that
the
existence
of
tradition
has
nothing
to
do
with
evidence
and
that
objections
taken
from
history
are
not
valid
when
contradicted
by
ecclesiastical
decrees
authority
must
conquer
history
this
inclination
to
get
rid
of
evidence
was
specially
associated
with
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
because
it
is
necessary
that
the
popes
themselves
should
not
testify
against
their
own
claim
they
may
be
declared
superior
to
all
other
authorities
but
not
to
that
of
their
own
see
their
history
is
not
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
their
rights
it
could
not
be
disregarded
and
the
provocation
to
alter
or
to
deny
its
testimony
was
so
urgent
that
men
of
piety
and
learning
became
a
prey
to
the
temptation
of
deceit
when
it
was
discovered
in
the
manuscript
of
the
that
the
popes
had
for
centuries
condemned
honorius
in
their
profession
of
faith
cardinal
bona
the
most
eminent
man
in
rome
advised
that
the
book
should
be
suppressed
if
the
difficulty
could
not
be
got
over
and
it
was
suppressed
accordingly
men
guilty
of
this
kind
of
fraud
would
justify
it
by
saying
that
their
religion
transcends
the
wisdom
of
philosophers
and
can
not
submit
to
the
criticism
of
historians
if
any
fact
manifestly
contradicts
a
dogma
that
is
a
warning
to
science
to
revise
the
evidence
there
must
be
some
defect
in
the
materials
or
in
the
method
pending
its
discovery
the
true
believer
is
constrained
humbly
but
confidently
to
deny
the
fact
the
protest
of
conscience
against
this
fraudulent
piety
grew
loud
and
strong
as
the
art
of
criticism
became
more
certain
the
use
made
of
it
by
catholics
in
the
literature
of
the
present
age
and
their
acceptance
of
the
conditions
of
scientific
controversy
seemed
to
ecclesiastical
authorities
a
sacrifice
of
principle
a
jealousy
arose
that
ripened
into
antipathy
almost
every
writer
who
really
served
catholicism
fell
sooner
or
later
under
the
disgrace
or
the
suspicion
of
rome
but
its
censures
had
lost
efficacy
and
it
was
found
that
the
progress
of
literature
could
only
be
brought
under
control
by
an
increase
of
authority
this
could
be
obtained
if
a
general
council
declared
the
decisions
of
the
roman
congregations
absolute
and
the
pope
infallible
the
division
between
the
roman
and
the
catholic
elements
in
the
church
made
it
hopeless
to
mediate
between
them
and
it
is
strange
that
men
who
must
have
regarded
each
other
as
insincere
christians
or
as
insincere
catholics
should
not
have
perceived
that
their
meeting
in
council
was
an
imposture
it
may
be
that
a
portion
though
only
a
small
portion
of
those
who
failed
to
attend
stayed
away
from
that
motive
but
the
view
proscribed
at
rome
was
not
largely
represented
in
the
episcopate
and
it
was
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
manifested
at
all
the
opposition
did
not
spring
from
it
but
maintained
itself
by
reducing
to
the
utmost
the
distance
that
separated
it
from
the
strictly
roman
opinions
and
striving
to
prevent
the
open
conflict
of
principles
it
was
composed
of
ultramontanes
in
the
mask
of
liberals
and
of
liberals
in
the
mask
of
ultramontanes
therefore
the
victory
or
defeat
of
the
minority
was
not
the
supreme
issue
of
the
council
besides
and
above
the
definition
of
infallibility
arose
the
question
how
far
the
experience
of
the
actual
encounter
would
open
the
eyes
and
search
the
hearts
of
the
reluctant
bishops
and
how
far
their
language
and
their
attitude
would
contribute
to
the
impulse
of
future
reform
there
was
a
point
of
view
from
which
the
failure
of
all
attempts
to
avert
the
result
by
false
issues
and
foreign
intrusion
and
the
success
of
the
measures
which
repelled
conciliation
and
brought
on
an
open
struggle
and
an
overwhelming
triumph
were
means
to
another
and
a
more
importunate
end
two
events
occurred
in
the
autumn
which
portended
trouble
for
the
winter
on
the
of
september
nineteen
german
bishops
assembled
at
fulda
published
a
pastoral
letter
in
which
they
affirmed
that
the
whole
episcopate
was
perfectly
unanimous
that
the
council
would
neither
introduce
new
dogmas
nor
invade
the
civil
province
and
that
the
pope
intended
its
deliberations
to
be
free
the
patent
and
direct
meaning
of
this
declaration
was
that
the
bishops
repudiated
the
design
announced
by
the
and
the
and
it
was
received
at
rome
with
indignation
but
it
soon
appeared
that
it
was
worded
with
studied
ambiguity
to
be
signed
by
men
of
opposite
opinions
and
to
conceal
the
truth
the
bishop
of
mentz
read
a
paper
written
by
a
professor
of
würzburg
against
the
wisdom
of
raising
the
question
but
expressed
his
own
belief
in
the
dogma
of
papal
infallibility
and
when
another
bishop
stated
his
disbelief
in
it
the
bishop
of
paderborn
assured
him
that
rome
would
soon
strip
him
of
his
heretical
skin
the
majority
wished
to
prevent
the
definition
if
possible
without
disputing
the
doctrine
and
they
wrote
a
private
letter
to
the
pope
warning
him
of
the
danger
and
entreating
him
to
desist
several
bishops
who
had
signed
the
pastoral
refused
their
signatures
to
the
private
letter
it
caused
so
much
dismay
at
rome
that
its
nature
was
carefully
concealed
and
a
diplomatist
was
able
to
report
on
the
authority
of
cardinal
antonelli
that
it
did
not
exist
in
the
middle
of
november
the
bishop
of
orleans
took
leave
of
his
diocese
in
a
letter
which
touched
lightly
on
the
learned
questions
connected
with
papal
infallibility
but
described
the
objections
to
the
definition
as
of
such
a
kind
that
they
could
not
be
removed
coming
from
a
prelate
who
was
so
conspicuous
as
a
champion
of
the
papacy
who
had
saved
the
temporal
power
and
justified
the
syllabus
this
declaration
unexpectedly
altered
the
situation
at
rome
it
was
clear
that
the
definition
would
be
opposed
and
that
the
opposition
would
have
the
support
of
illustrious
names
the
bishops
who
began
to
arrive
early
in
november
were
received
with
the
assurance
that
the
alarm
which
had
been
raised
was
founded
on
phantoms
it
appeared
that
nobody
had
dreamed
of
defining
infallibility
or
that
if
the
idea
had
been
entertained
at
all
it
had
been
abandoned
cardinals
antonelli
berardi
and
de
luca
and
the
secretary
fessler
disavowed
the
the
ardent
indiscretion
that
was
displayed
beyond
the
alps
contrasted
strangely
with
the
moderation
the
friendly
candour
the
majestic
and
impartial
wisdom
which
were
found
to
reign
in
the
higher
sphere
of
the
hierarchy
a
bishop
afterwards
noted
among
the
opponents
of
the
dogma
wrote
home
that
the
idea
that
infallibility
was
to
be
defined
was
entirely
unfounded
it
was
represented
as
a
mere
fancy
got
up
in
bavarian
newspapers
with
evil
intent
and
the
bishop
of
sura
had
been
its
dupe
the
insidious
report
would
have
deserved
contempt
if
it
had
caused
a
revival
of
obsolete
opinions
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
council
to
herald
it
with
such
demonstrations
and
it
unfortunately
became
difficult
to
leave
it
unnoticed
the
decision
must
be
left
to
the
bishops
the
holy
see
could
not
restrain
their
legitimate
ardour
if
they
chose
to
express
it
but
it
would
take
no
initiative
whatever
was
done
would
require
to
be
done
with
so
much
moderation
as
to
satisfy
everybody
and
to
avoid
the
offence
of
a
party
triumph
some
suggested
that
there
should
be
no
anathema
for
those
who
questioned
the
doctrine
and
one
prelate
imagined
that
a
formula
could
be
contrived
which
even
janus
could
not
dispute
and
which
yet
would
be
found
in
reality
to
signify
that
the
pope
is
infallible
there
was
a
general
assumption
that
no
materials
existed
for
contention
among
the
bishops
and
that
they
stood
united
against
the
world
cardinal
antonelli
openly
refrained
from
connecting
himself
with
the
preparation
of
the
council
and
surrounded
himself
with
divines
who
were
not
of
the
ruling
party
he
had
never
learned
to
doubt
the
dogma
itself
but
he
was
keenly
alive
to
the
troubles
it
would
bring
upon
him
and
thought
that
the
pope
was
preparing
a
repetition
of
the
difficulties
which
followed
the
beginning
of
his
pontificate
he
was
not
trusted
as
a
divine
or
consulted
on
questions
of
theology
but
he
was
expected
to
ward
off
political
complications
and
he
kept
the
ground
with
unflinching
skill
the
pope
exhorted
the
diplomatic
corps
to
aid
him
in
allaying
the
alarm
of
the
infatuated
germans
he
assured
one
diplomatist
that
the
did
not
speak
in
his
name
he
told
another
that
he
would
sanction
no
proposition
that
could
sow
dissension
among
the
bishops
he
said
to
a
third
you
come
to
be
present
at
a
scene
of
pacification
he
described
his
object
in
summoning
the
council
to
be
to
obtain
a
remedy
for
old
abuses
and
for
recent
errors
more
than
once
addressing
a
group
of
bishops
he
said
that
he
would
do
nothing
to
raise
disputes
among
them
and
would
be
content
with
a
declaration
in
favour
of
intolerance
he
wished
of
course
that
catholicism
should
have
the
benefit
of
toleration
in
england
and
russia
but
the
principle
must
be
repudiated
by
a
church
holding
the
doctrine
of
exclusive
salvation
the
meaning
of
this
intimation
that
persecution
would
do
as
a
substitute
for
infallibility
was
that
the
most
glaring
obstacle
to
the
definition
would
be
removed
if
the
inquisition
was
recognised
as
consistent
with
catholicism
indeed
it
seemed
that
infallibility
was
a
means
to
an
end
which
could
be
obtained
in
other
ways
and
that
he
would
have
been
satisfied
with
a
decree
confirming
the
article
of
the
syllabus
and
declaring
that
no
pope
has
ever
exceeded
the
just
bounds
of
his
authority
in
faith
in
politics
or
in
morals
most
of
the
bishops
had
allowed
themselves
to
be
reassured
when
the
bull
regulating
the
procedure
at
the
council
was
put
into
circulation
in
the
first
days
of
december
the
pope
assumed
to
himself
the
sole
initiative
in
proposing
topics
and
the
exclusive
nomination
of
the
officers
of
the
council
he
invited
the
bishops
to
bring
forward
their
own
proposals
but
required
that
they
should
submit
them
first
of
all
to
a
commission
which
was
appointed
by
himself
and
consisted
half
of
italians
if
any
proposal
was
allowed
to
pass
by
this
commission
it
had
still
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
pope
who
could
therefore
exclude
at
will
any
topic
even
if
the
whole
council
wished
to
discuss
it
four
elective
commissions
were
to
mediate
between
the
council
and
the
pope
when
a
decree
had
been
discussed
and
opposed
it
was
to
be
referred
together
with
the
amendments
to
one
of
these
commissions
where
it
was
to
be
reconsidered
with
the
aid
of
divines
when
it
came
back
from
the
commission
with
corrections
and
remarks
it
was
to
be
put
to
the
vote
without
further
debate
what
the
council
discussed
was
to
be
the
work
of
unknown
divines
what
it
voted
was
to
be
the
work
of
a
majority
in
a
commission
of
it
was
in
the
election
of
these
commissions
that
the
episcopate
obtained
the
chance
of
influencing
the
formation
of
its
decrees
but
the
papal
theologians
retained
their
predominance
for
they
might
be
summoned
to
defend
or
alter
their
work
in
the
commission
from
which
the
bishops
who
had
spoken
or
proposed
amendments
were
excluded
practically
the
right
of
initiative
was
the
deciding
point
even
if
the
first
regulation
had
remained
in
force
the
bishops
could
never
have
recovered
the
surprises
and
the
difficulty
of
preparing
for
unforeseen
debates
the
regulation
ultimately
broke
down
under
the
mistake
of
allowing
the
decree
to
be
debated
only
once
and
that
in
its
crude
state
as
it
came
from
the
hands
of
the
divines
the
authors
of
the
measure
had
not
contemplated
any
real
discussion
it
was
so
unlike
the
way
in
which
business
was
conducted
at
trent
where
the
right
of
the
episcopate
was
formally
asserted
where
the
envoys
were
consulted
and
the
bishops
discussed
the
questions
in
several
groups
before
the
general
congregations
that
the
printed
text
of
the
tridentine
regulation
was
rigidly
suppressed
it
was
further
provided
that
the
reports
of
the
speeches
should
not
be
communicated
to
the
bishops
and
the
strictest
secrecy
was
enjoined
on
all
concerning
the
business
of
the
council
the
bishops
being
under
no
obligation
to
observe
this
rule
were
afterwards
informed
that
it
bound
them
under
grievous
sin
this
important
precept
did
not
succeed
in
excluding
the
action
of
public
opinion
it
could
be
applied
only
to
the
debates
and
many
bishops
spoke
with
greater
energy
and
freedom
before
an
assembly
of
their
own
order
than
they
would
have
done
if
their
words
had
been
taken
down
by
protestants
to
be
quoted
against
them
at
home
but
printed
documents
distributed
in
seven
hundred
copies
could
not
be
kept
secret
the
rule
was
subject
to
exceptions
which
destroyed
its
efficacy
and
the
roman
cause
was
discredited
by
systematic
concealment
and
advocacy
that
abounded
in
explanation
and
colour
but
abstained
from
the
substance
of
fact
documents
couched
in
the
usual
official
language
being
dragged
into
the
forbidden
light
of
day
were
supposed
to
reveal
dark
mysteries
the
secrecy
of
the
debates
had
a
bad
effect
in
exaggerating
reports
and
giving
wide
scope
to
fancy
rome
was
not
vividly
interested
in
the
discussions
but
its
cosmopolitan
society
was
thronged
with
the
several
adherents
of
leading
bishops
whose
partiality
compromised
their
dignity
and
envenomed
their
disputes
everything
that
was
said
was
repeated
inflated
and
distorted
whoever
had
a
sharp
word
for
an
adversary
which
could
not
be
spoken
in
council
knew
of
an
audience
that
would
enjoy
and
carry
the
matter
the
battles
of
the
aula
were
fought
over
again
with
anecdote
epigram
and
fiction
a
distinguished
courtesy
and
nobleness
of
tone
prevailed
at
the
beginning
when
the
archbishop
of
halifax
went
down
to
his
place
on
the
of
december
after
delivering
the
speech
which
taught
the
reality
of
the
opposition
the
presidents
bowed
to
him
as
he
passed
them
the
denunciations
of
the
roman
system
by
strossmayer
and
darboy
were
listened
to
in
january
without
a
murmur
adversaries
paid
exorbitant
compliments
to
each
other
like
men
whose
disagreements
were
insignificant
and
who
were
one
at
heart
as
the
plot
thickened
fatigue
excitement
friends
who
fetched
and
carried
made
the
tone
more
bitter
in
february
the
bishop
of
laval
described
dupanloup
publicly
as
the
centre
of
a
conspiracy
too
shameful
to
be
expressed
in
words
and
professed
that
he
would
rather
die
than
be
associated
with
such
iniquity
one
of
the
minority
described
his
opponents
as
having
disported
themselves
on
a
certain
occasion
like
a
herd
of
cattle
by
that
time
the
whole
temper
of
the
council
had
been
changed
the
pope
himself
had
gone
into
the
arena
and
violence
of
language
and
gesture
had
become
an
artifice
adopted
to
hasten
the
end
when
the
council
opened
many
bishops
were
bewildered
and
dispirited
by
the
bull
they
feared
that
a
struggle
could
not
be
averted
as
even
if
no
dogmatic
question
was
raised
their
rights
were
cancelled
in
a
way
that
would
make
the
pope
absolute
in
dogma
one
of
the
cardinals
caused
him
to
be
informed
that
the
regulation
would
be
resisted
but
pius
ix
knew
that
in
all
that
procession
of
bishops
one
idea
prevailed
men
whose
word
is
powerful
in
the
centres
of
civilisation
men
who
three
months
before
were
confronting
martyrdom
among
barbarians
preachers
at
notre
dame
professors
from
germany
republicans
from
western
america
men
with
every
sort
of
training
and
every
sort
of
experience
had
come
together
as
confident
and
as
eager
as
the
prelates
of
rome
itself
to
hail
the
pope
infallible
resistance
was
improbable
for
it
was
hopeless
it
was
improbable
that
bishops
who
had
refused
no
token
of
submission
for
twenty
years
would
now
combine
to
inflict
dishonour
on
the
pope
in
their
address
of
they
had
confessed
that
he
is
the
father
and
teacher
of
all
christians
that
all
the
things
he
has
spoken
were
spoken
by
peter
through
him
that
they
would
believe
and
teach
all
that
he
believed
and
taught
in
they
had
allowed
him
to
proclaim
a
dogma
which
some
of
them
dreaded
and
some
opposed
but
to
which
all
submitted
when
he
had
decreed
without
the
intervention
of
a
council
the
recent
display
of
opposition
did
not
justify
serious
alarm
the
fulda
bishops
feared
the
consequences
in
germany
but
they
affirmed
that
all
were
united
and
that
there
would
be
no
new
dogma
they
were
perfectly
informed
of
all
that
was
being
got
ready
in
rome
the
words
of
their
pastoral
meant
nothing
if
they
did
not
mean
that
infallibility
was
no
new
dogma
and
that
all
the
bishops
believed
in
it
even
the
bishop
of
orleans
avoided
a
direct
attack
on
the
doctrine
proclaimed
his
own
devotion
to
the
pope
and
promised
that
the
council
would
be
a
scene
of
concord
it
was
certain
that
any
real
attempt
that
might
be
made
to
prevent
the
definition
could
be
overwhelmed
by
the
preponderance
of
those
bishops
whom
the
modern
constitution
of
the
church
places
in
dependence
on
rome
the
only
bishops
whose
position
made
them
capable
of
resisting
were
the
germans
and
the
french
and
all
that
rome
would
have
to
contend
with
was
the
modern
liberalism
and
decrepit
gallicanism
of
france
and
the
science
of
germany
the
gallican
school
was
nearly
extinct
it
had
no
footing
in
other
countries
and
it
was
essentially
odious
to
the
liberals
the
most
serious
minds
of
the
liberal
party
were
conscious
that
rome
was
as
dangerous
to
ecclesiastical
liberty
as
paris
but
since
the
syllabus
made
it
impossible
to
pursue
the
liberal
doctrines
consistently
without
collision
with
rome
they
had
ceased
to
be
professed
with
a
robust
and
earnest
confidence
and
the
party
was
disorganised
they
set
up
the
pretence
that
the
real
adversary
of
their
opinions
was
not
the
pope
but
a
french
newspaper
and
they
fought
the
king
troops
in
the
king
name
when
the
bishop
of
orleans
made
his
declaration
they
fell
back
and
left
him
to
mount
the
breach
alone
montalembert
the
most
vigorous
spirit
among
them
became
isolated
from
his
former
friends
and
accused
them
with
increasing
vehemence
of
being
traitors
to
their
principles
during
the
last
disheartening
year
of
his
life
he
turned
away
from
the
clergy
of
his
country
which
was
sunk
in
romanism
and
felt
that
the
real
abode
of
his
opinions
was
on
the
rhine
it
was
only
lately
that
the
ideas
of
the
coblentz
address
which
had
so
deeply
touched
the
sympathies
of
montalembert
had
spread
widely
in
germany
they
had
their
seat
in
the
universities
and
their
transit
from
the
interior
of
to
the
outer
world
was
laborious
and
slow
the
invasion
of
roman
doctrines
had
given
vigour
and
popularity
to
those
which
opposed
them
but
the
growing
influence
of
the
universities
brought
them
into
direct
antagonism
with
the
episcopate
the
austrian
bishops
were
generally
beyond
its
reach
and
the
german
bishops
were
generally
at
war
with
it
in
december
one
of
the
most
illustrious
of
them
said
we
bishops
are
absorbed
in
our
work
and
are
not
scholars
we
sadly
need
the
help
of
those
that
are
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
council
will
raise
only
such
questions
as
can
be
dealt
with
competently
by
practical
experience
and
common
sense
the
force
that
germany
wields
in
theology
was
only
partially
represented
in
its
episcopate
at
the
opening
of
the
council
the
known
opposition
consisted
of
four
men
cardinal
schwarzenberg
had
not
published
his
opinion
but
he
made
it
known
as
soon
as
he
came
to
rome
he
brought
with
him
a
printed
paper
entitled
patribus
concilii
oecumenici
in
which
he
adopted
the
ideas
of
the
divines
and
canonists
who
are
the
teachers
of
his
bohemian
clergy
he
entreated
the
council
not
to
multiply
unnecessary
articles
of
faith
and
in
particular
to
abstain
from
defining
papal
infallibility
which
was
beset
with
difficulties
and
would
make
the
foundations
of
faith
to
tremble
even
in
the
devoutest
souls
he
pointed
out
that
the
index
could
not
continue
on
its
present
footing
and
urged
that
the
church
should
seek
her
strength
in
the
cultivation
of
liberty
and
learning
not
in
privilege
and
coercion
that
she
should
rely
on
popular
institutions
and
obtain
popular
support
he
warmly
advocated
the
system
of
autonomy
that
was
springing
up
in
hungary
unlike
schwarzenberg
dupanloup
and
maret
the
archbishop
of
paris
had
taken
no
hostile
step
in
reference
to
the
council
but
he
was
feared
the
most
of
all
the
men
expected
at
rome
the
pope
had
refused
to
make
him
a
cardinal
and
had
written
to
him
a
letter
of
reproof
such
as
has
seldom
been
received
by
a
bishop
it
was
felt
that
he
was
hostile
not
episodically
to
a
single
measure
but
to
the
peculiar
spirit
of
this
pontificate
he
had
none
of
the
conventional
prejudices
and
assumed
antipathies
which
are
congenial
to
the
hierarchical
mind
he
was
without
passion
or
pathos
or
affectation
and
he
had
good
sense
a
perfect
temper
and
an
intolerable
wit
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
made
the
syllabus
an
occasion
to
impress
moderation
on
the
pope
your
blame
has
power
o
vicar
of
jesus
christ
but
your
blessing
is
more
potent
still
god
has
raised
you
to
the
apostolic
see
between
the
two
halves
of
this
century
that
you
may
absolve
the
one
and
inaugurate
the
other
be
it
yours
to
reconcile
reason
with
faith
liberty
with
authority
politics
with
the
church
from
the
height
of
that
triple
majesty
with
which
religion
age
and
misfortune
adorn
you
all
that
you
do
and
all
that
you
say
reaches
far
to
disconcert
or
to
encourage
the
nations
give
them
from
your
large
priestly
heart
one
word
to
amnesty
the
past
to
reassure
the
present
and
to
open
the
horizons
of
the
future
the
security
into
which
many
unsuspecting
bishops
had
been
lulled
quickly
disappeared
and
they
understood
that
they
were
in
presence
of
a
conspiracy
which
would
succeed
at
once
if
they
did
not
provide
against
acclamation
and
must
succeed
at
last
if
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
bull
it
was
necessary
to
make
sure
that
no
decree
should
be
passed
without
reasonable
discussion
and
to
make
a
stand
against
the
regulation
the
first
congregation
held
on
the
of
december
was
a
scene
of
confusion
but
it
appeared
that
a
bishop
from
the
turkish
frontier
had
risen
against
the
order
of
proceeding
and
that
the
president
had
stopped
him
saying
that
this
was
a
matter
decided
by
the
pope
and
not
submitted
to
the
council
the
bishops
perceived
that
they
were
in
a
snare
some
began
to
think
of
going
home
others
argued
that
questions
of
divine
right
were
affected
by
the
regulation
and
that
they
were
bound
to
stake
the
existence
of
the
council
upon
them
many
were
more
eager
on
this
point
of
law
than
on
the
point
of
dogma
and
were
brought
under
the
influence
of
the
more
men
with
whom
they
would
not
have
come
in
contact
through
any
sympathy
on
the
question
of
infallibility
the
desire
of
protesting
against
the
violation
of
privileges
was
an
imperfect
bond
the
bishops
had
not
yet
learned
to
know
each
other
and
they
had
so
strongly
impressed
upon
their
flocks
at
home
the
idea
that
rome
ought
to
be
trusted
that
they
were
going
to
manifest
the
unity
of
the
church
and
to
confound
the
insinuations
of
her
enemies
that
they
were
not
quick
to
admit
all
the
significance
of
the
facts
they
found
nothing
vigorous
was
possible
in
a
body
of
so
loose
a
texture
the
softer
materials
had
to
be
eliminated
the
stronger
welded
together
by
severe
and
constant
pressure
before
an
opposition
could
be
made
capable
of
effective
action
they
signed
protests
that
were
of
no
effect
they
petitioned
they
did
not
resist
it
was
seen
how
much
rome
had
gained
by
excluding
the
ambassadors
for
this
question
of
forms
and
regulations
would
have
admitted
the
action
of
diplomacy
the
idea
of
being
represented
at
the
council
was
revived
in
france
and
a
weary
negotiation
began
which
lasted
several
months
and
accomplished
nothing
but
delay
it
was
not
till
the
policy
of
intervention
had
ignominiously
failed
and
till
its
failure
had
left
the
roman
court
to
cope
with
the
bishops
alone
that
the
real
question
was
brought
on
for
discussion
and
as
long
as
the
chance
remained
that
political
considerations
might
keep
infallibility
out
of
the
council
the
opposition
abstained
from
declaring
its
real
sentiments
its
union
was
precarious
and
delusive
but
it
lasted
in
this
state
long
enough
to
enable
secondary
influences
to
do
much
towards
supplying
the
place
of
principles
while
the
protesting
bishops
were
not
committed
against
infallibility
it
would
have
been
possible
to
prevent
resistance
to
the
bull
from
becoming
resistance
to
the
dogma
the
bishop
of
grenoble
who
was
reputed
a
good
divine
among
his
countrymen
was
sounded
in
order
to
discover
how
far
he
would
go
and
it
was
ascertained
that
he
admitted
the
doctrine
substantially
at
the
same
time
the
friends
of
the
bishop
of
orleans
were
insisting
that
he
had
questioned
not
the
dogma
but
the
definition
and
maret
in
the
defence
of
his
book
declared
that
he
attributed
no
infallibility
to
the
episcopate
apart
from
the
pope
if
the
bishops
had
been
consulted
separately
without
the
terror
of
a
decree
it
is
probable
that
the
number
of
those
who
absolutely
rejected
the
doctrine
would
have
been
extremely
small
there
were
many
who
had
never
thought
seriously
about
it
or
imagined
that
it
was
true
in
a
pious
sense
though
not
capable
of
proof
in
controversy
the
possibility
of
an
understanding
seemed
so
near
that
the
archbishop
of
westminster
who
held
the
pope
infallible
apart
from
the
episcopate
required
that
the
words
should
be
translated
into
french
in
the
sense
of
independence
and
not
of
exclusion
an
ambiguous
formula
embodying
the
view
common
to
both
parties
or
founded
on
mutual
concession
would
have
done
more
for
the
liberty
than
the
unity
of
opinion
and
would
not
have
strengthened
the
authority
of
the
pope
it
was
resolved
to
proceed
with
caution
putting
in
motion
the
strong
machinery
of
rome
and
exhausting
the
advantages
of
organisation
and
foreknowledge
the
first
act
of
the
council
was
to
elect
the
commission
on
dogma
a
proposal
was
made
on
very
high
authority
that
the
list
should
be
drawn
up
so
as
to
represent
the
different
opinions
fairly
and
to
include
some
of
the
chief
opponents
they
would
have
been
subjected
to
other
influences
than
those
which
sustain
party
leaders
they
would
have
been
separated
from
their
friends
and
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
adversaries
they
would
have
felt
the
strain
of
official
responsibility
and
the
opposition
would
have
been
decapitated
if
these
sagacious
counsels
had
been
followed
the
harvest
of
july
might
have
been
gathered
in
january
and
the
reaction
that
was
excited
in
the
long
struggle
that
ensued
might
have
been
prevented
cardinal
de
angelis
who
ostensibly
managed
the
elections
and
was
advised
by
archbishop
manning
preferred
the
opposite
and
more
prudent
course
he
caused
a
lithographed
list
to
be
sent
to
all
the
bishops
open
to
influence
from
which
every
name
was
excluded
that
was
not
on
the
side
of
infallibility
meantime
the
bishops
of
several
nations
selected
those
among
their
countrymen
whom
they
recommended
as
candidates
the
germans
and
hungarians
above
forty
in
number
assembled
for
this
purpose
under
the
presidency
of
cardinal
schwarzenberg
and
their
meetings
were
continued
and
became
more
and
more
important
as
those
who
did
not
sympathise
with
the
opposition
dropped
away
the
french
were
divided
into
two
groups
and
met
partly
at
cardinal
mathieu
partly
at
cardinal
bonnechose
a
fusion
was
proposed
but
was
resisted
in
the
roman
interest
by
bonnechose
he
consulted
cardinal
antonelli
and
reported
that
the
pope
disliked
large
meetings
of
bishops
moreover
if
all
the
french
had
met
in
one
place
the
opposition
would
have
had
the
majority
and
would
have
determined
the
choice
of
the
candidates
they
voted
separately
and
the
bonnechose
list
was
represented
to
foreign
bishops
as
the
united
choice
of
the
french
episcopate
the
mathieu
group
believed
that
this
had
been
done
fraudulently
and
resolved
to
make
their
complaint
to
the
pope
but
cardinal
mathieu
seeing
that
a
storm
was
rising
and
that
he
would
be
called
on
to
be
the
spokesman
of
his
friends
hurried
away
to
spend
christmas
at
besançon
all
the
votes
of
his
group
were
thrown
away
even
the
bishop
of
grenoble
who
had
obtained
votes
at
one
meeting
and
thirteen
at
the
other
was
excluded
from
the
commission
it
was
constituted
as
the
managers
of
the
election
desired
and
the
first
trial
of
strength
appeared
to
have
annihilated
the
opposition
the
force
under
entire
control
of
the
court
could
be
estimated
from
the
number
of
votes
cast
blindly
for
candidates
not
put
forward
by
their
own
countrymen
and
unknown
to
others
who
had
therefore
no
recommendation
but
that
of
the
official
list
according
to
this
test
rome
could
dispose
of
votes
the
moment
of
this
triumph
was
chosen
for
the
production
of
an
act
already
two
months
old
by
which
many
ancient
censures
were
revoked
and
many
were
renewed
the
legislation
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
sixteenth
century
appointed
nearly
two
hundred
cases
by
which
excommunication
was
incurred
without
inquiry
or
sentence
they
had
generally
fallen
into
oblivion
or
were
remembered
as
instances
of
former
extravagance
but
they
had
not
been
abrogated
and
as
they
were
in
part
defensible
they
were
a
trouble
to
timorous
consciences
there
was
reason
to
expect
that
this
question
which
had
often
occupied
the
attention
of
the
bishops
would
be
brought
before
the
council
and
the
demand
for
a
reform
could
not
have
been
withstood
the
difficulty
was
anticipated
by
sweeping
away
as
many
censures
as
it
was
thought
safe
to
abandon
and
deciding
independently
of
the
bishops
what
must
be
retained
the
pope
reserved
to
himself
alone
the
faculty
of
absolving
from
the
sin
of
harbouring
or
defending
the
members
of
any
sect
of
causing
priests
to
be
tried
by
secular
courts
of
violating
asylum
or
alienating
the
real
property
of
the
church
the
prohibition
of
anonymous
writing
was
restricted
to
works
on
theology
and
the
excommunication
hitherto
incurred
by
reading
books
which
are
on
the
index
was
confined
to
readers
of
heretical
books
this
constitution
had
no
other
immediate
effect
than
to
indicate
the
prevailing
spirit
and
to
increase
the
difficulties
of
the
partisans
of
rome
the
organ
of
the
archbishop
of
cologne
justified
the
last
provision
by
saying
that
it
does
not
forbid
the
works
of
jews
for
jews
are
not
heretics
nor
the
heretical
tracts
and
newspapers
for
they
are
not
books
nor
listening
to
heretical
books
read
aloud
for
hearing
is
not
reading
at
the
same
time
the
serious
work
of
the
council
was
begun
a
long
dogmatic
decree
was
distributed
in
which
the
special
theological
biblical
and
philosophical
opinions
of
the
school
now
dominant
in
rome
were
proposed
for
ratification
it
was
so
weak
a
composition
that
it
was
as
severely
criticised
by
the
romans
as
by
the
foreigners
and
there
were
germans
whose
attention
was
first
called
to
its
defects
by
an
italian
cardinal
the
disgust
with
which
the
text
of
the
first
decree
was
received
had
not
been
foreseen
no
real
discussion
had
been
expected
the
council
hall
admirable
for
occasions
of
ceremony
was
extremely
ill
adapted
for
speaking
and
nothing
would
induce
the
pope
to
give
it
up
a
public
session
was
fixed
for
the
of
january
and
the
election
of
commissions
was
to
last
till
christmas
it
was
evident
that
nothing
would
be
ready
for
the
session
unless
the
decree
was
accepted
without
debate
or
infallibility
adopted
by
acclamation
before
the
council
had
been
assembled
a
fortnight
a
store
of
discontent
had
accumulated
which
it
would
have
been
easy
to
avoid
every
act
of
the
pope
the
bull
the
declaration
of
censures
the
text
of
the
proposed
decree
even
the
announcement
that
the
council
should
be
dissolved
in
case
of
his
death
had
seemed
an
injury
or
an
insult
to
the
episcopate
these
measures
undid
the
favourable
effect
of
the
caution
with
which
the
bishops
had
been
received
they
did
what
the
dislike
of
infallibility
alone
would
not
have
done
they
broke
the
spell
of
veneration
for
pius
ix
which
fascinated
the
catholic
episcopate
the
jealousy
with
which
he
guarded
his
prerogative
in
the
appointment
of
officers
and
of
the
great
commission
the
pressure
during
the
elections
the
prohibition
of
national
meetings
the
refusal
to
hold
the
debates
in
a
hall
where
they
could
be
heard
irritated
and
alarmed
many
bishops
they
suspected
that
they
had
been
summoned
for
the
very
purpose
they
had
indignantly
denied
to
make
the
papacy
more
absolute
by
abdicating
in
favour
of
the
official
prelature
of
rome
confidence
gave
way
to
a
great
despondency
and
a
state
of
feeling
was
aroused
which
prepared
the
way
for
actual
opposition
when
the
time
should
come
before
christmas
the
germans
and
the
french
were
grouped
nearly
as
they
remained
to
the
end
after
the
flight
of
cardinal
mathieu
and
the
refusal
of
cardinal
bonnechose
to
coalesce
the
friends
of
the
latter
gravitated
towards
the
roman
centre
and
the
friends
of
the
former
held
their
meetings
at
the
house
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
they
became
with
the
meeting
under
cardinal
schwarzenberg
the
strength
and
substance
of
the
party
that
opposed
the
new
dogma
but
there
was
little
intercourse
between
the
two
and
their
exclusive
nationality
made
them
useless
as
a
nucleus
for
the
few
scattered
american
english
and
italian
bishops
whose
sympathies
were
with
them
to
meet
this
object
and
to
centralise
the
deliberations
about
a
dozen
of
the
leading
men
constituted
an
international
meeting
which
included
the
best
talents
but
also
the
most
discordant
views
they
were
too
little
united
to
act
with
vigour
and
too
few
to
exercise
control
some
months
later
they
increased
their
numbers
they
were
the
brain
but
not
the
will
of
the
opposition
cardinal
rauscher
presided
rome
honoured
him
as
the
author
of
the
austrian
concordat
but
he
feared
that
infallibility
would
bring
destruction
on
his
work
and
he
was
the
most
constant
the
most
copious
and
the
most
emphatic
of
its
opponents
when
the
debate
opened
on
the
of
december
the
idea
of
proclaiming
the
dogma
by
acclamation
had
not
been
abandoned
the
archbishop
of
paris
exacted
a
promise
that
it
should
not
be
attempted
but
he
was
warned
that
the
promise
held
good
for
the
first
day
only
and
that
there
was
no
engagement
for
the
future
then
he
made
it
known
that
one
hundred
bishops
were
ready
if
a
surprise
was
attempted
to
depart
from
rome
and
to
carry
away
the
council
as
he
said
in
the
soles
of
their
shoes
the
plan
of
carrying
the
measure
by
a
sudden
resolution
was
given
up
and
it
was
determined
to
introduce
it
with
a
demonstration
of
overwhelming
effect
the
debate
on
the
dogmatic
decree
was
begun
by
cardinal
rauscher
the
archbishop
of
louis
spoke
on
the
same
day
so
briefly
as
not
to
reveal
the
force
and
the
fire
within
him
the
archbishop
of
halifax
concluded
a
long
speech
by
saying
that
the
proposal
laid
before
the
council
was
only
fit
to
be
put
decorously
under
ground
much
praise
was
lavished
on
the
bishops
who
had
courage
knowledge
and
latin
enough
to
address
the
assembled
fathers
and
the
council
rose
instantly
in
dignity
and
in
esteem
when
it
was
seen
that
there
was
to
be
real
discussion
on
the
rome
was
excited
by
the
success
of
two
speakers
one
was
the
bishop
of
grenoble
the
other
was
strossmayer
the
bishop
from
the
turkish
frontier
who
had
again
assailed
the
regulation
and
had
again
been
stopped
by
the
presiding
cardinal
the
fame
of
his
spirit
and
eloquence
began
to
spread
over
the
city
and
over
the
world
the
ideas
that
animated
these
men
in
their
attack
on
the
proposed
measure
were
most
clearly
shown
a
few
days
later
in
the
speech
of
a
swiss
prelate
what
boots
it
he
exclaimed
to
condemn
errors
that
have
been
long
condemned
and
tempt
no
catholic
the
false
beliefs
of
mankind
are
beyond
the
reach
of
your
decrees
the
best
defence
of
catholicism
is
religious
science
give
to
the
pursuit
of
sound
learning
every
encouragement
and
the
widest
field
and
prove
by
deeds
as
well
as
words
that
the
progress
of
nations
in
liberty
and
light
is
the
mission
of
the
church
the
tempest
of
criticism
was
weakly
met
and
the
opponents
established
at
once
a
superiority
in
debate
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
nothing
had
been
done
and
the
session
imprudently
fixed
for
the
of
january
had
to
be
filled
up
with
tedious
ceremonies
everybody
saw
that
there
had
been
a
great
miscalculation
the
council
was
slipping
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
court
and
the
regulation
was
a
manifest
hindrance
to
the
despatch
of
business
new
resources
were
required
a
new
president
was
appointed
cardinal
reisach
had
died
at
the
end
of
december
without
having
been
able
to
take
his
seat
and
cardinal
de
luca
had
presided
in
his
stead
de
angelis
was
now
put
into
the
place
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
reisach
he
had
suffered
imprisonment
at
turin
and
the
glory
of
his
confessorship
was
enhanced
by
his
services
in
the
election
of
the
commissions
he
was
not
suited
otherwise
to
be
the
moderator
of
a
great
assembly
and
the
effect
of
his
elevation
was
to
dethrone
the
accomplished
and
astute
de
luca
who
had
been
found
deficient
in
thoroughness
and
to
throw
the
management
of
the
council
into
the
hands
of
the
junior
presidents
capalti
and
bilio
bilio
was
a
barnabite
monk
innocent
of
court
intrigues
a
friend
of
the
most
enlightened
scholars
in
rome
and
a
favourite
of
the
pope
cardinal
capalti
had
been
distinguished
as
a
canonist
like
cardinal
bilio
he
was
not
reckoned
among
men
of
the
extreme
party
and
they
were
not
always
in
harmony
with
their
colleagues
de
angelis
and
bizarri
but
they
did
not
waver
when
the
policy
they
had
to
execute
was
not
their
own
the
first
decree
was
withdrawn
and
referred
to
the
commission
on
doctrine
another
on
the
duties
of
the
episcopate
was
substituted
and
that
again
was
followed
by
others
of
which
the
most
important
was
on
the
catechism
while
they
were
being
discussed
a
petition
was
prepared
demanding
that
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
should
be
made
the
object
of
a
decree
the
majority
undertook
to
put
a
strain
on
the
prudence
or
the
reluctance
of
the
vatican
their
zeal
in
the
cause
was
warmer
than
that
of
the
official
advisers
among
those
who
had
the
responsibility
of
conducting
the
spiritual
and
temporal
government
of
the
pope
the
belief
was
strong
that
his
infallibility
did
not
need
defining
and
that
the
definition
could
not
be
obtained
without
needless
obstruction
to
other
papal
interests
several
cardinals
were
inopportunists
at
first
and
afterwards
promoted
intermediate
and
conciliatory
proposals
but
the
business
of
the
council
was
not
left
to
the
ordinary
advisers
of
the
pope
and
they
were
visibly
compelled
and
driven
by
those
who
represented
the
majority
at
times
this
pressure
was
no
doubt
convenient
but
there
were
also
times
when
there
was
no
collusion
and
the
majority
really
led
the
authorities
the
initiative
was
not
taken
by
the
great
mass
whose
zeal
was
stimulated
by
personal
allegiance
to
the
pope
they
added
to
the
momentum
but
the
impulse
came
from
men
who
were
as
independent
as
the
chiefs
of
the
opposition
the
great
petition
supported
by
others
pointing
to
the
same
end
was
kept
back
for
several
weeks
and
was
presented
at
the
end
of
january
at
that
time
the
opposition
had
attained
its
full
strength
and
presented
a
praying
that
the
question
might
not
be
introduced
it
was
written
by
cardinal
rauscher
and
was
signed
with
variations
by
bishops
to
obtain
that
number
the
address
avoided
the
doctrine
itself
and
spoke
only
of
the
difficulty
and
danger
in
defining
it
so
that
this
their
most
imposing
act
was
a
confession
of
inherent
weakness
and
a
signal
to
the
majority
that
they
might
force
on
the
dogmatic
discussion
the
bishops
stood
on
the
negative
they
showed
no
sense
of
their
mission
to
renovate
catholicism
and
it
seemed
that
they
would
compound
for
the
concession
they
wanted
by
yielding
in
all
other
matters
even
those
which
would
be
a
practical
substitute
for
infallibility
that
this
was
not
to
be
that
the
forces
needed
for
a
great
revival
were
really
present
was
made
manifest
by
the
speech
of
strossmayer
on
the
of
january
when
he
demanded
the
reformation
of
the
court
of
rome
decentralisation
in
the
government
of
the
church
and
decennial
councils
that
earnest
spirit
did
not
animate
the
bulk
of
the
party
they
were
content
to
leave
things
as
they
were
to
gain
nothing
if
they
lost
nothing
to
renounce
all
premature
striving
for
reform
if
they
could
succeed
in
avoiding
a
doctrine
which
they
were
as
unwilling
to
discuss
as
to
define
the
words
of
ginoulhiac
to
strossmayer
you
terrify
me
with
your
pitiless
logic
expressed
the
inmost
feelings
of
many
who
gloried
in
the
grace
and
the
splendour
of
his
eloquence
no
words
were
too
strong
for
them
if
they
prevented
the
necessity
of
action
and
spared
the
bishops
the
distressing
prospect
of
being
brought
to
bay
and
having
to
resist
openly
the
wishes
and
the
claims
of
rome
infallibility
never
ceased
to
overshadow
every
step
of
the
council
but
it
had
already
given
birth
to
a
deeper
question
the
church
had
less
to
fear
from
the
violence
of
the
majority
than
from
the
inertness
of
their
opponents
no
proclamation
of
false
doctrines
could
be
so
great
a
disaster
as
the
weakness
of
faith
which
would
prove
that
the
power
of
recovery
the
vital
force
of
catholicism
was
extinct
in
the
episcopate
it
was
better
to
be
overcome
after
openly
attesting
their
belief
than
to
strangle
both
discussion
and
definition
and
to
disperse
without
having
uttered
a
single
word
that
could
reinstate
the
authorities
of
the
church
in
the
respect
of
men
the
future
depended
less
on
the
outward
struggle
between
two
parties
than
on
the
process
by
which
the
stronger
spirit
within
the
minority
leavened
the
mass
the
opposition
was
as
averse
to
the
actual
dogmatic
discussion
among
themselves
as
in
the
council
they
feared
an
inquiry
which
would
divide
them
at
first
the
bishops
who
understood
and
resolutely
contemplated
their
real
mission
in
the
council
were
exceedingly
few
their
influence
was
strengthened
by
the
force
of
events
by
the
incessant
pressure
of
the
majority
and
by
the
action
of
literary
opinion
early
in
december
the
archbishop
of
mechlin
brought
out
a
reply
to
the
letter
of
the
bishop
of
orleans
who
immediately
prepared
a
rejoinder
but
could
not
obtain
permission
to
print
it
in
rome
it
appeared
two
months
later
at
naples
whilst
the
minority
were
under
the
shock
of
this
prohibition
gratry
published
at
paris
the
first
of
four
letters
to
the
archbishop
of
mechlin
in
which
the
case
of
honorius
was
discussed
with
so
much
perspicuity
and
effect
that
the
profane
public
was
interested
and
the
pamphlets
were
read
with
avidity
in
rome
they
contained
no
new
research
but
they
went
deep
into
the
causes
which
divided
catholics
gratry
showed
that
the
roman
theory
is
still
propped
by
fables
which
were
innocent
once
but
have
become
deliberate
untruths
since
the
excuse
of
mediæval
ignorance
was
dispelled
and
he
declared
that
this
school
of
lies
was
the
cause
of
the
weakness
of
the
church
and
called
on
catholics
to
look
the
scandal
in
the
face
and
cast
out
the
religious
forgers
his
letters
did
much
to
clear
the
ground
and
to
correct
the
confusion
of
ideas
among
the
french
the
bishop
of
brieuc
wrote
that
the
exposure
was
an
excellent
service
to
religion
for
the
evil
had
gone
so
far
that
silence
would
be
complicity
gratry
was
no
sooner
approved
by
one
bishop
than
he
was
condemned
by
a
great
number
of
others
he
had
brought
home
to
his
countrymen
the
question
whether
they
could
be
accomplices
of
a
dishonest
system
or
would
fairly
attempt
to
root
it
out
while
gratry
letters
were
disturbing
the
french
döllinger
published
some
observations
on
the
petition
for
infallibility
directing
his
attack
clearly
against
the
doctrine
itself
during
the
excitement
that
ensued
he
answered
demonstrations
of
sympathy
by
saying
that
he
had
only
defended
the
faith
which
was
professed
substantially
by
the
majority
of
the
episcopate
in
germany
these
words
dropped
like
an
acid
on
the
german
bishops
they
were
writhing
to
escape
the
dire
necessity
of
a
conflict
with
the
pope
and
it
was
very
painful
to
them
to
be
called
as
compurgators
by
a
man
who
was
esteemed
the
foremost
opponent
of
the
roman
system
whose
hand
was
suspected
in
everything
that
had
been
done
against
it
and
who
had
written
many
things
on
the
sovereign
obligations
of
truth
and
faith
which
seemed
an
unmerciful
satire
on
the
tactics
to
which
they
clung
the
notion
that
the
bishops
were
opposing
the
dogma
itself
was
founded
on
their
address
against
the
regulation
but
the
petition
against
the
definition
of
infallibility
was
so
worded
as
to
avoid
that
inference
and
had
accordingly
obtained
nearly
twice
as
many
german
and
hungarian
signatures
as
the
other
the
bishop
of
mentz
vehemently
repudiated
the
supposition
for
himself
and
invited
his
colleagues
to
do
the
same
some
followed
his
example
others
refused
and
it
became
apparent
that
the
german
opposition
was
divided
and
included
men
who
accepted
the
doctrines
of
rome
the
precarious
alliance
between
incompatible
elements
was
prevented
from
breaking
up
by
the
next
act
of
the
papal
government
the
defects
in
the
mode
of
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
council
were
admitted
on
both
sides
two
months
had
been
lost
and
the
demand
for
a
radical
change
was
publicly
made
in
behalf
of
the
minority
by
a
letter
communicated
to
the
on
the
of
february
a
new
regulation
was
introduced
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
quickening
progress
it
gave
the
presidents
power
to
cut
short
any
speech
and
provided
that
debate
might
be
cut
short
at
any
moment
when
the
majority
pleased
it
also
declared
that
the
decrees
should
be
carried
by
majority
decernetur
quod
majori
patrum
numero
the
policy
of
leaving
the
decisive
power
in
the
hands
of
the
council
itself
had
this
advantage
that
its
exercise
would
not
raise
the
question
of
liberty
and
coercion
in
the
same
way
as
the
interference
of
authority
by
the
bull
no
bishop
could
introduce
any
matter
not
approved
by
the
pope
by
the
new
regulation
he
could
not
speak
on
any
question
before
the
council
if
the
majority
chose
to
close
the
discussion
or
if
the
presidents
chose
to
abridge
his
speech
he
could
print
nothing
in
rome
and
what
was
printed
elsewhere
was
liable
to
be
treated
as
contraband
his
written
observations
on
any
measure
were
submitted
to
the
commission
without
any
security
that
they
would
be
made
known
to
the
other
bishops
in
their
integrity
there
was
no
longer
an
obstacle
to
the
immediate
definition
of
papal
infallibility
the
majority
was
omnipotent
the
minority
could
not
accept
this
regulation
without
admitting
that
the
pope
is
infallible
their
thesis
was
that
his
decrees
are
not
free
from
the
risk
of
error
unless
they
express
the
universal
belief
of
the
episcopate
the
idea
that
particular
virtue
attaches
to
a
certain
number
of
bishops
or
that
infallibility
depends
on
a
few
votes
more
or
less
was
defended
by
nobody
if
the
act
of
a
majority
of
bishops
in
the
council
possibly
not
representing
a
majority
in
the
church
is
infallible
it
derives
its
infallibility
from
the
pope
nobody
held
that
the
pope
was
bound
to
proclaim
a
dogma
carried
by
a
majority
the
minority
contested
the
principle
of
the
new
regulation
and
declared
that
a
dogmatic
decree
required
virtual
unanimity
the
chief
protest
was
drawn
up
by
a
french
bishop
some
of
the
hungarians
added
a
paragraph
asserting
that
the
authority
and
oecumenicity
of
the
council
depended
on
the
settlement
of
this
question
and
they
proposed
to
add
that
they
could
not
continue
to
act
as
though
it
were
legitimate
unless
this
point
was
given
up
the
author
of
the
address
declined
this
passage
urging
that
the
time
for
actual
menace
was
not
yet
come
from
that
day
the
minority
agreed
in
rejecting
as
invalid
any
doctrine
which
should
not
be
passed
by
unanimous
consent
on
this
point
the
difference
between
the
thorough
and
the
simulated
opposition
was
effaced
for
ginoulhiac
and
ketteler
were
as
positive
as
kenrick
or
hefele
but
it
was
a
point
which
rome
could
not
surrender
without
giving
up
its
whole
position
to
wait
for
unanimity
was
to
wait
for
ever
and
to
admit
that
a
minority
could
prevent
or
nullify
the
dogmatic
action
of
the
papacy
was
to
renounce
infallibility
no
alternative
remained
to
the
opposing
bishops
but
to
break
up
the
council
the
most
eminent
among
them
accepted
this
conclusion
and
stated
it
in
a
paper
declaring
that
the
absolute
and
indisputable
law
of
the
church
had
been
violated
by
the
regulation
allowing
articles
of
faith
to
be
decreed
on
which
the
episcopate
was
not
morally
unanimous
and
that
the
council
no
longer
possessing
in
the
eyes
of
the
bishops
and
of
the
world
the
indispensable
condition
of
liberty
and
legality
would
be
inevitably
rejected
to
avert
a
public
scandal
and
to
save
the
honour
of
the
holy
see
it
was
proposed
that
some
unopposed
decrees
should
be
proclaimed
in
solemn
session
and
the
council
immediately
prorogued
at
the
end
of
march
a
breach
seemed
unavoidable
the
first
part
of
the
dogmatic
decree
had
come
back
from
the
commission
so
profoundly
altered
that
it
was
generally
accepted
by
the
bishops
but
with
a
crudely
expressed
sentence
in
the
preamble
which
was
intended
to
rebuke
the
notion
of
the
reunion
of
protestant
churches
several
bishops
looked
upon
this
passage
as
an
insult
to
protestants
and
wished
it
changed
but
there
was
danger
that
if
they
then
joined
in
voting
the
decree
they
would
commit
themselves
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
regulation
against
which
they
had
protested
on
the
of
march
strossmayer
raised
both
questions
he
said
that
it
was
neither
just
nor
charitable
to
impute
the
progress
of
religious
error
to
the
protestants
the
germ
of
modern
unbelief
existed
among
the
catholics
before
the
reformation
and
afterwards
bore
its
worst
fruits
in
catholic
countries
many
of
the
ablest
defenders
of
christian
truth
were
protestants
and
the
day
of
reconciliation
would
have
come
already
but
for
the
violence
and
uncharitableness
of
the
catholics
these
words
were
greeted
with
execrations
and
the
remainder
of
the
speech
was
delivered
in
the
midst
of
a
furious
tumult
at
length
when
strossmayer
declared
that
the
council
had
forfeited
its
authority
by
the
rule
which
abolished
the
necessity
of
unanimity
the
presidents
and
the
multitude
refused
to
let
him
go
on
on
the
following
day
he
drew
up
a
protest
declaring
that
he
could
not
acknowledge
the
validity
of
the
council
if
dogmas
were
to
be
decided
by
a
majority
and
sent
it
to
the
presidents
after
it
had
been
approved
at
the
meeting
of
the
germans
and
by
bishops
of
other
nations
the
preamble
was
withdrawn
and
another
was
inserted
in
its
place
which
had
been
written
in
great
haste
by
the
german
jesuit
kleutgen
and
was
received
with
general
applause
several
of
the
jesuits
obtained
credit
for
the
ability
and
moderation
with
which
the
decree
was
drawn
up
it
was
no
less
than
a
victory
over
extreme
counsels
a
unanimous
vote
was
insured
for
the
public
session
of
april
and
harmony
was
restored
but
the
text
proposed
originally
in
the
name
had
undergone
so
many
changes
as
to
make
it
appear
that
his
intentions
had
been
thwarted
there
was
a
supplement
to
the
decree
which
the
bishops
had
understood
would
be
withdrawn
in
order
that
the
festive
concord
and
good
feeling
might
not
be
disturbed
they
were
informed
at
the
last
moment
that
it
would
be
put
to
the
vote
as
its
withdrawal
would
be
a
confession
of
defeat
for
rome
the
supplement
was
an
admonition
that
the
constitutions
and
decrees
of
the
holy
see
must
be
observed
even
when
they
proscribe
opinions
not
actually
heretical
extraordinary
efforts
were
made
in
public
and
in
private
to
prevent
any
open
expression
of
dissent
from
this
paragraph
the
bishop
of
brixen
assured
his
brethren
in
the
name
of
the
commission
that
it
did
not
refer
to
questions
of
doctrine
and
they
could
not
dispute
the
general
principle
that
obedience
is
due
to
lawful
authority
the
converse
proposition
that
the
papal
acts
have
no
claim
to
be
obeyed
was
obviously
untenable
the
decree
was
adopted
unanimously
there
were
some
who
gave
their
vote
with
a
heavy
heart
conscious
of
the
snare
strossmayer
alone
stayed
away
the
opposition
was
at
an
end
archbishop
manning
afterwards
reminded
them
that
by
this
vote
they
had
implicitly
accepted
infallibility
they
had
done
even
more
they
might
conceivably
contrive
to
bind
and
limit
dogmatic
infallibility
with
conditions
so
stringent
as
to
evade
many
of
the
objections
taken
from
the
examples
of
history
but
in
requiring
submission
to
papal
decrees
on
matters
not
articles
of
faith
they
were
approving
that
of
which
they
knew
the
character
they
were
confirming
without
let
or
question
a
power
they
saw
in
daily
exercise
they
were
investing
with
new
authority
the
existing
bulls
and
giving
unqualified
sanction
to
the
inquisition
and
the
index
to
the
murder
of
heretics
and
the
deposing
of
kings
they
approved
what
they
were
called
on
to
reform
and
solemnly
blessed
with
their
lips
what
their
hearts
knew
to
be
accursed
the
court
of
rome
became
thenceforth
reckless
in
its
scorn
of
the
opposition
and
proceeded
in
the
belief
that
there
was
no
protest
they
would
not
forget
no
principle
they
would
not
betray
rather
than
defy
the
pope
in
his
wrath
it
was
at
once
determined
to
bring
on
the
discussion
of
the
dogma
of
infallibility
at
first
when
the
minority
knew
that
their
prayers
and
their
sacrifices
had
been
vain
and
that
they
must
rely
on
their
own
resources
they
took
courage
in
extremity
rauscher
schwarzenberg
hefele
ketteler
kenrick
wrote
pamphlets
or
caused
them
to
be
written
against
the
dogma
and
circulated
them
in
the
council
several
english
bishops
protested
that
the
denial
of
infallibility
by
the
catholic
episcopate
had
been
an
essential
condition
of
emancipation
and
that
they
could
not
revoke
that
assurance
after
it
had
served
their
purpose
without
being
dishonoured
in
the
eyes
of
their
countrymen
the
archbishop
of
louis
admitting
the
force
of
the
argument
derived
from
the
fact
that
a
dogma
was
promulgated
in
which
had
long
been
disputed
and
denied
confessed
that
he
could
not
prove
the
immaculate
conception
to
be
really
an
article
of
faith
an
incident
occurred
in
june
which
showed
that
the
experience
of
the
council
was
working
a
change
in
the
fundamental
convictions
of
the
bishops
döllinger
had
written
in
march
that
an
article
of
faith
required
not
only
to
be
approved
and
accepted
unanimously
by
the
council
but
that
the
bishops
united
with
the
pope
are
not
infallible
and
that
the
oecumenicity
of
their
acts
must
be
acknowledged
and
ratified
by
the
whole
church
father
hötzl
a
franciscan
friar
having
published
a
pamphlet
in
defence
of
this
proposition
was
summoned
to
rome
and
required
to
sign
a
paper
declaring
that
the
confirmation
of
a
council
by
the
pope
alone
makes
it
oecumenical
he
put
his
case
into
the
hands
of
german
bishops
who
were
eminent
in
the
opposition
asking
first
their
opinion
on
the
proposed
declaration
and
secondly
their
advice
on
his
own
conduct
the
bishops
whom
he
consulted
replied
that
they
believed
the
declaration
to
be
erroneous
but
they
added
that
they
had
only
lately
arrived
at
the
conviction
and
had
been
shocked
at
first
by
döllinger
doctrine
they
could
not
require
him
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
being
condemned
at
rome
as
a
rebellious
friar
and
obstinate
heretic
for
a
view
which
they
themselves
had
doubted
only
three
months
before
he
followed
the
advice
but
he
perceived
that
his
advisers
had
considerately
betrayed
him
when
the
observations
on
infallibility
which
the
bishops
had
sent
in
to
the
commission
appeared
in
print
it
seemed
that
the
minority
had
burnt
their
ships
they
affirmed
that
the
dogma
would
put
an
end
to
the
conversion
of
protestants
that
it
would
drive
devout
men
out
of
the
church
and
make
catholicism
indefensible
in
controversy
that
it
would
give
governments
apparent
reason
to
doubt
the
fidelity
of
catholics
and
would
give
new
authority
to
the
theory
of
persecution
and
of
the
deposing
power
they
testified
that
it
was
unknown
in
many
parts
of
the
church
and
was
denied
by
the
fathers
so
that
neither
perpetuity
nor
universality
could
be
pleaded
in
its
favour
and
they
declared
it
an
absurd
contradiction
founded
on
ignoble
deceit
and
incapable
of
being
made
an
article
of
faith
by
pope
or
council
one
bishop
protested
that
he
would
die
rather
than
proclaim
it
another
thought
it
would
be
an
act
of
suicide
for
the
church
what
was
said
during
the
two
months
debate
by
men
perpetually
liable
to
be
interrupted
by
a
majority
acting
less
from
conviction
than
by
command
could
be
of
no
practical
account
and
served
for
protest
not
for
persuasion
apart
from
the
immediate
purpose
of
the
discussion
two
speeches
were
memorable
that
of
archbishop
conolly
of
halifax
for
the
uncompromising
clearness
with
which
he
appealed
to
scripture
and
repudiated
all
dogmas
extracted
from
the
speculations
of
divines
and
not
distinctly
founded
on
the
recorded
word
of
god
and
that
of
archbishop
darboy
who
foretold
that
a
decree
which
increased
authority
without
increasing
power
and
claimed
for
one
man
whose
infallibility
was
only
now
defined
the
obedience
which
the
world
refused
to
the
whole
episcopate
whose
right
had
been
unquestioned
in
the
church
for
years
would
raise
up
new
hatred
and
new
suspicion
weaken
the
influence
of
religion
over
society
and
wreak
swift
ruin
on
the
temporal
power
the
general
debate
had
lasted
three
weeks
and
bishops
were
still
to
speak
when
it
was
brought
to
a
close
by
an
abrupt
division
on
the
of
june
for
hours
the
indignation
of
the
minority
was
strong
it
was
the
last
decisive
opportunity
for
them
to
reject
the
legitimacy
of
the
council
there
were
some
who
had
despaired
of
it
from
the
beginning
and
held
that
the
bull
deprived
it
of
legal
validity
but
it
had
not
been
possible
to
make
a
stand
at
a
time
when
no
man
knew
whether
he
could
trust
his
neighbour
and
when
there
was
fair
ground
to
hope
that
the
worst
rules
would
be
relaxed
when
the
second
regulation
interpreted
according
to
the
interruptors
of
strossmayer
claimed
the
right
of
proclaiming
dogmas
which
part
of
the
episcopate
did
not
believe
it
became
doubtful
whether
the
bishops
could
continue
to
sit
without
implicit
submission
they
restricted
themselves
to
a
protest
thinking
that
it
was
sufficient
to
meet
words
with
words
and
that
it
would
be
time
to
act
when
the
new
principle
was
actually
applied
by
the
vote
of
the
of
june
the
obnoxious
regulation
was
enforced
in
a
way
evidently
injurious
to
the
minority
and
their
cause
the
chiefs
of
the
opposition
were
now
convinced
of
the
invalidity
of
the
council
and
advised
that
they
should
all
abstain
from
speaking
and
attend
at
peter
only
to
negative
by
their
vote
the
decree
which
they
disapproved
in
this
way
they
thought
that
the
claim
to
oecumenicity
would
be
abolished
without
breach
or
violence
the
greater
number
were
averse
to
so
vigorous
a
demonstration
and
hefele
threw
the
great
weight
of
his
authority
into
their
scale
he
contended
that
they
would
be
worse
than
their
word
if
they
proceeded
to
extremities
on
this
occasion
they
had
announced
that
they
would
do
it
only
to
prevent
the
promulgation
of
a
dogma
which
was
opposed
if
that
were
done
the
council
would
be
revolutionary
and
tyrannical
and
they
ought
to
keep
their
strongest
measure
in
reserve
for
that
last
contingency
the
principle
of
unanimity
was
fundamental
it
admitted
no
ambiguity
and
was
so
clear
simple
and
decisive
that
there
was
no
risk
in
fixing
on
it
the
archbishops
of
paris
milan
halifax
the
bishops
of
djakovar
orleans
marseilles
and
most
of
the
hungarians
yielded
to
these
arguments
and
accepted
the
policy
of
less
strenuous
colleagues
while
retaining
the
opinion
that
the
council
was
of
no
authority
but
there
were
some
who
deemed
it
unworthy
and
inconsistent
to
attend
an
assembly
which
they
had
ceased
to
respect
the
debate
on
the
several
paragraphs
lasted
till
the
beginning
of
july
and
the
decree
passed
at
length
with
dissentient
votes
it
was
made
known
that
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
would
be
promulgated
in
solemn
session
on
the
and
that
all
who
were
present
would
be
required
to
sign
an
act
of
submission
some
bishops
of
the
minority
thereupon
proposed
that
they
should
all
attend
repeat
their
vote
and
refuse
their
signature
they
exhorted
their
brethren
to
set
a
conspicuous
example
of
courage
and
fidelity
as
the
catholic
world
would
not
remain
true
to
the
faith
if
the
bishops
were
believed
to
have
faltered
but
it
was
certain
that
there
were
men
amongst
them
who
would
renounce
their
belief
rather
than
incur
the
penalty
of
excommunication
who
preferred
authority
to
proof
and
accepted
the
pope
declaration
la
tradizione
son
io
it
was
resolved
by
a
small
majority
that
the
opposition
should
renew
its
negative
vote
in
writing
and
should
leave
rome
in
a
body
before
the
session
some
of
the
most
conscientious
and
resolute
adversaries
of
the
dogma
advised
this
course
looking
to
the
immediate
future
they
were
persuaded
that
an
irresistible
reaction
was
at
hand
and
that
the
decrees
of
the
vatican
council
would
fade
away
and
be
dissolved
by
a
power
mightier
than
the
episcopate
and
a
process
less
perilous
than
schism
their
disbelief
in
the
validity
of
its
work
was
so
profound
that
they
were
convinced
that
it
would
perish
without
violence
and
they
resolved
to
spare
the
pope
and
themselves
the
indignity
of
a
rupture
their
last
manifesto
dernière
is
an
appeal
for
patience
an
exhortation
to
rely
on
the
guiding
healing
hand
of
god
they
deemed
that
they
had
assigned
the
course
which
was
to
save
the
church
by
teaching
the
catholics
to
reject
a
council
which
was
neither
legitimate
in
constitution
free
in
action
nor
unanimous
in
doctrine
but
to
observe
moderation
in
contesting
an
authority
over
which
great
catastrophes
impend
they
conceived
that
it
would
thus
be
possible
to
save
the
peace
and
unity
of
the
church
without
sacrifice
of
faith
and
reason

a
history
of
the
inquisition
of
the
middle
ages
by
henry
charles
lea
a
good
many
years
ago
when
bishop
wilberforce
was
at
winchester
and
the
earl
of
beaconsfield
was
a
character
in
fiction
the
bishop
was
interested
in
the
proposal
to
bring
over
the
utrecht
psalter
disraeli
thought
the
scheme
absurd
of
course
he
said
you
wo
get
it
he
was
told
that
nevertheless
such
things
are
that
public
manuscripts
had
even
been
sent
across
the
atlantic
in
order
that
lea
might
write
a
history
of
the
inquisition
yes
he
replied
but
they
never
came
back
again
the
work
which
has
been
awaited
so
long
has
come
over
at
last
and
will
assuredly
be
accepted
as
the
most
important
contribution
of
the
new
world
to
the
religious
history
of
the
old
other
books
have
shown
the
author
as
a
thoughtful
inquirer
in
the
remunerative
but
perilous
region
where
religion
and
politics
conflict
where
ideas
and
institutions
are
as
much
considered
as
persons
and
events
and
history
is
charged
with
all
the
elements
of
fixity
development
and
change
it
is
little
to
say
now
that
he
equals
buckle
in
the
extent
and
surpasses
him
in
the
intelligent
choice
and
regulation
of
his
reading

to

that

the
later
inquisition

with
the
spanish
and
developing
into
the

is
not
so
much
a
prolongation
or
a
revival
as
a
new
creation
the
mediæval
inquisition
strove
to
control
states
and
was
an
engine
of
government
the
modern
strove
to
coerce
the
protestants

was
an
engine
of

technically
still
in

he
makes
too
little
of
a
fundamental
distinction
in
the
eye
of
the

the
modern
inquisition
eclipses
its
predecessor

the

the

this

has
been
maintained
by
the

and
by
the
jesuits

this
document
may
be
a
forgery
of
the
fifteenth
century
but
the
whole
of
the
dominican
version
is
dismissed
by
lea
with
contempt
he
has
heard
that
their
founder
once
rescued
a
heretic
from
the
flames
but
dominic
project
only
looked
to
their
peaceful
conversion
and
to
performing
the
duties
of
instruction
and
exhortation
nothing
is
better
authenticated
in
the
life
of
the
saint
than
the
fact
that
he
condemned
heretics
and
exercised
the
right
of
deciding
which
of
them
should
suffer
and
which
should
be
spared

the
transaction
is
memorable
in
dominican
annals
as
the
one
link
distinctly
connecting
saint
dominic
with
the
system
of
executions
and
the
only
security
possessed
by
the
order
that
the
most
conspicuous
of
its
actions
is
sanctioned
by
the
spirit
and
example
of
the
founder
the
original
authorities
record
it
and
it
is
commemorated
by
bzovius
and
malvenda
by
fontana
and
percin
by
echard
and
mamachi
as
well
as
in
the
those
are
exactly
the
authors
to
whom
in
the
first
instance
a
man
betakes
himself
who
desires
to
understand
the
inception
and
early
growth
of
the
inquisition
i
can
not
remember
that
any
one
of
them
appears
in
lea
notes
he
says
indeed
that
saint
dominic
inquisitorial
activity
is
affirmed
by
all
the
historians
of
the
order
and
he
is
a
workman
who
knows
his
tools
so
well
that
we
may
hesitate
to
impute
this
grave
omission
to
inacquaintance
with
necessary
literature
it
is
one
of
his
characteristics
to
be
suspicious
of
the
as
the
seat
of
fable
and
proper
domain
of
those
problems
in
psychology
against
which
the
certitude
of
history
is
always
going
to
pieces
where
motives
are
obscure
he
prefers
to
contemplate
causes
in
their
effects
and
to
look
abroad
over
his
vast
horizon
of
unquestioned
reality
the
difference
between
outward
and
interior
history
will
be
felt
by
any
one
who
compares
the
story
of
dolcino
here
given
with
the
account
in
neander
lea
knows
more
about
him
and
has
better
materials
than
the
ponderous
professor
of
pectoral
theology
but
he
has
not
all
neander
patience
and
power
to
read
significance
and
sense
in
the
musings
of
a
reckless
erratic
mind
he
believes
that
pope
gregory
ix
is
the
intellectual
originator
as
well
as
the
legislative
imponent
of
the
terrific
system
which
ripened
gradually
and
experimentally
in
his
pontificate
it
does
not
appear
whether
he
has
read
or
knows
through
havet
the
investigations
which
conducted
ficker
to
a
different
hypothesis
the
transition
of
from
the
saving
of
life
to
the
taking
of
life
by
fire
was
nearly
the
sharpest
that
men
can
conceive
and
in
pursuance
of
it
the
subsequent
legal
forms
are
mere
detail
the
spirit
and
practice
of
centuries
were
renounced
for
the
opposite
extreme
and
between
the
mercy
of
and
the
severity
of
there
was
no
intervening
stage
of
graduated
rigour
therefore
it
is
probable
that
the
new
idea
of
duty
foreign
to
italian
and
specifically
to
roman
ways
was
conveyed
by
a
new
man
that
a
new
influence
just
then
got
possession
of
the
pope
professor
ficker
signals
guala
as
the
real
contriver
of
the
of
terror
and
the
man
who
acquired
the
influence
imported
the
idea
and
directed
the
policy
guala
was
a
dominican
prior
whom
the
pope
trusted
in
emergencies
in
the
year
he
negotiated
the
treaty
of
san
germano
between
frederic
ii
and
the
church
and
was
made
bishop
of
brescia
in
that
year
brescia
first
among
italian
cities
inserted
in
its
statutes
the
emperor
lombard
law
of
which
sent
the
heretic
to
the
stake
the
inference
is
that
the
dominican
prelate
caused
its
insertion
and
that
nobody
is
so
likely
to
have
expounded
its
available
purport
to
the
pontiff
as
the
man
who
had
so
lately
caused
it
to
be
adopted
in
his
own
see
and
who
stood
high
just
then
in
merit
and
in
favour
that
guala
was
on
august
half
a
year
before
the
first
burnings
at
rome
we
know
that
he
caused
the
adoption
of
frederic
law
at
brescia
or
at
rome
is
not
in
evidence
of
that
abrupt
and
unexplained
enactment
little
is
told
us
but
this
we
are
told
that
it
was
inspired
by
honorius
leges

at

gregory
who
had
seen
most
things
since
the
elevation
of

knew
how
montfort
dealt
with
albigensian
prisoners
at
minerve
and
lavaur
what
penalties
were
in

at
toulouse
and
on
what
principles
master

administered
in

the

received
from

the
papacy
which
inspired
the
coronation
laws
of
in
which
there
is
no
mention
of
capital
punishment
could
not
have
been
unobservant
of
the
way
in
which
its
own
provisions
were
transformed
and
gregory
whom
honorius
had
already
called
magnum
et
speciale
ecclesie
romane
membrum
who
had
required
the
university
of
bologna
to
adopt
and
to
expound
the
new
legislation
and
who
knew
the
archbishop
of
magdeburg
had
little
to
learn
from
guala
about
the
formidable
weapon
supplied
to
that
prelate
for
the
government
of
lombardy
there
is
room
for
further
conjecture
in
those
days
it
was
discovered
that
arragon
was
infested
with
heresy
and
the
king
confessor
proposed
that
the
holy
see
be
applied
to
for
means
of
active
suppression
with
that
object
in
he
was
sent
to
rome
the
envoy
name
was
raymond
and
his
home
was
on
the
coast
of
catalonia
in
the
town
of
pennaforte
he
was
a
bolognese
jurist
a
dominican
and
the
author
of
the
most
celebrated
treatise
on
morals
made
public
in
the
generation
preceding
the
scholastic
theology
the
five
years
of
his
abode
in
rome
changed
the
face
of
the
church
he
won
the
confidence
of
gregory
became
penitentiary
and
was
employed
to
codify
the
acts
of
the
popes
militant
since
the
publication
of
gratian
very
soon
after
saint
raymond
appeared
at
the
papal
court
the
use
of
the
stake
became
law
the
inquisitorial
machinery
had
been
devised
and
the
management
given
to
the
priors
of
the
order
when
he
departed
he
left
behind
him
instructions
for
the
treatment
of
heresy
which
the
pope
adopted
and
sent
out
where
they
were
wanted
he
refused
a
mitre
rose
to
be
general
it
is
said
in
opposition
to
albertus
magnus
and
retired
early
to
become
in
his
own
country
the
oracle
of
councils
on
the
watch
for
heterodoxy
until
he
came
in
spite
of
much
violence
and
many
laws
the
popes
had
imagined
no
permanent
security
against
religious
error
and
were
not
formally
committed
to
death
by
burning
gregory
himself
excelling
all
the
priesthood
in
vigour
and
experience
had
for
four
years
laboured
vaguely
and
in
vain
with
the
transmitted
implements
of
a
sudden
in
three
successive
measures
he
finds
his
way
and
builds
up
the
institution
which
is
to
last
for
centuries
that
this
mighty
change
in
the
conditions
of
religious
thought
and
life
and
in
the
functions
of
the
order
was
suggested
by
dominicans
is
probable
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
was
the
work
of
the
foremost
dominican
then
living
who
at
that
very
moment
had
risen
to
power
and
predominance
at
rome
no
sane
observer
will
allow
himself
to
overdraw
the
influence
of
national
character
on
events
yet
there
was
that
in
the
energetic
race
that
dwell
with
the
pyrenees
above
them
and
the
ebro
below
that
suited
a
leading
part
in
the
business
of
organised
persecution
they
are
among
the
nations
that
have
been
inventors
in
politics
and
both
the
constitution
of
arragon
and
that
of
the
society
of
jesus
prove
their
constructive
science
while
people
in
other
lands
were
feeling
their
way
doubtful
and
debonair
arragon
went
straight
to
the
end
before
the
first
persecuting
pope
was
elected
before
the
child
of
apulia
who
was
to
be
the
first
persecuting
emperor
was
born
alfonso
proscribed
the
heretics
king
and
clergy
were
in
such
accord
that
three
years
later
the
council
of
girona
decreed
that
they
might
be
beaten
while
they
remained
and
should
be
burnt
if
they
came
back
it
was
under
this
government
amid
these
surroundings
that
saint
dominic
grew
up
whom
sixtus
speaking
on
authority
which
we
do
not
possess
entitled
the
first
inquisitor
saint
raymond
who
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
saint
dominic
was
his
countryman
eymerici
whose
was
the
best
authority
until
the
of
guidonis
appeared
presided
during
forty
years
over
the
arragonese
tribunal
and
his
commentator
pegna
the
coke
upon
littleton
of
inquisitorial
jurisprudence
came
from
the
same
stern
region
the
générale
de
in
its
new
shape
has
supplied
lea
with
so
good
a
basis
that
his
obligations
to
the
present
editors
bring
him
into
something
like
dependence
on
french
scholarship
he
designates
monarchs
by
the
names
they
bear
in
france
louis
le
germanique
charles
le
sage
philippe
le
bon
and
even
philippe
and
this
habit
with
foulques
and
berenger
of
tours
with
aretino
for
arezzo
oldenburg
for
altenburg
torgau
for
zürich
imparts
an
exotic
flavour
which
would
be
harmless
but
for
a
surviving
preference
for
french
books
compared
with
bouquet
and
vaissète
he
is
unfamiliar
with
böhmer
and
pertz
for
matthew
paris
he
gets
little
or
no
help
from
coxe
or
madden
or
luard
or
liebermann
or
huillard
in
france
few
things
of
importance
have
escaped
him
his
account
of
marguerite

differs
from
that
given
by

in

and
the
difference
is
left
unexplained
no

how

he

and
it
is
more
likely
that
the
fear
of

caused

than
merely
to
throw
the

the
energy
with
which
lea
beats
up
information
is
extraordinary
even
when
imperfectly
economised
he
justly
makes
ample
use
of
the
paparum
which
he
takes
apparently
from
the
papal
volume
of
muratori
these
biographies
were
edited
by
baluze
with
notes
and
documents
of
such
value
that
avignon
without
him
is
like
athenæus
without
casaubon
or
the
theodosian
code
without
godefroy
but
if
he
neglects
him
in
print
he
constantly
quotes
a
certain
paris
manuscript
in
which
i
think
i
recognise
the
very
one
which
baluze
employed
together
with
guidonis
and
eymerici
the
leading
authority
of
the
fourteenth
century
is
zanchini
who
became
an
inquisitor
at
rimini
in
and
died
in
his
book
was
published
with
a
commentary
by
campeggio
one
of
the
tridentine
fathers
and
campeggio
was
further
annotated
by
simancas
who
exposes
the
disparity
between
italian
and
spanish
usage
it
was
reprinted
with
other
treatises
of
the
same
kind
in
the
eleventh
volume
of
the
some
of
these
treatises
and
the
notes
of
campeggio
and
simancas
are
passed
over
by
lea
without
notice
but
he
appreciates
zanchini
so
well
that
he
has
had
him
copied
from
a
manuscript
in
france
very
much
against
his
habit
he
prints
one
entire
sentence
from
which
it
appears
that
his
copy
does
not
agree
to
the
letter
with
the
published
text
it
is
not
clear
in
every
case
whether
he
is
using
print
or
manuscript
one
of
the
most
interesting
directions
for
inquisitors
and
one
of
the
earliest
was
written
by
cardinal
fulcodius
better
known
as
clement
iv
lea
cites
him
a
dozen
times
always
accurately
always
telling
us
scrupulously
which
of
the
fifteen
chapters
to
consult
the
treatise
of
fulcodius
occupies
a
few
pages
in
carena
officio
in
which
besides
other
valuable
matter
there
are
notes
by
carena
himself
and
a
tract
by
pegna
the
perpetual
commentator
of
the
inquisition
this
is
one
of
the
first
eight
or
ten
books
which
occur
to
any
one
whose
duty
it
is
to
lay
in
an
inquisitor
library
not
only
we
are
never
told
where
to
find
fulcodius
but
when
carena
is
mentioned
it
is
so
done
as
to
defy
verification
inartistic
references
are
not
in
this
instance
a
token
of
inadequate
study
but
a
book
designed
only
for
readers
who
know
at
a
glance
where
to
lay
their
finger
on
francis
collat
monasticae
collat
or
constt
iv
xix
cod
will
be
slow
in
recovering
outlay
not
his
acquaintance
with
rare
books
only
which
might
be
the
curiosity
of
an
epicurean
but
with
the
right
and
appropriate
book
amazes
the
reader
like
most
things
attributed
to
abbot
joachim
the
vaticinia
pontificum
is
a
volume
not
in
common
use
and
decent
people
may
be
found
who
never
saw
a
copy
lea
says
i
have
met
with
editions
of
venice
issued
in
and
of
ferrara
in
of
frankfort
in
of
padua
in
and
of
naples
in
and
there
are
doubtless
numerous
others
this
is
the
general
level
throughout
the
rare
failures
disappear
in
the
imposing
supererogation
of
knowledge
it
could
not
be
exceeded
by
the
pupils
of
the
göttingen
seminary
or
the
école
des
chartes
they
have
sometimes
a
vicious
practice
of
overtopping
sufficient
proof
with
irrelevant
testimony
but
they
transcribe
all
deciding
words
in
full
and
for
the
rest
quicken
and
abridge
our
toil
by
sending
us
not
to
chapter
and
verse
but
to
volume
and
page
of
the
physical
and
concrete
book
we
would
gladly
give
bluebeard
and
his
wife
he
had
but
one
after
all
in
exchange
for
the
best
quotations
from
sources
hard
of
access
which
lea
must
have
hoarded
in
the
course
of
labours
such
as
no
man
ever
achieved
before
him
or
will
ever
attempt
hereafter
it
would
increase
the
usefulness
of
his
volumes
and
double
their
authority
there
are
indeed
fifty
pages
of
documentary
matter
not
entirely
new
or
very
closely
connected
with
the
text
portions
of
this
besides
are
derived
from
manuscripts
explored
in
france
and
italy
but
not
it
seems
in
rome
and
in
this
way
much
curious
and
valuable
material
underlies
the
pages
but
it
is
buried
without
opportunity
of
display
or
scrutiny
line
upon
line
of
references
to
the
neapolitan
archives
only
bewilder
and
exasperate
lea
who
dealt
more
generously
with
the
readers
of
has
refused
himself
in
these
overcrowded
volumes
that
protection
against
overstatement
the
want
of
verifiable
indication
of
authorities
is
annoying
especially
at
first
and
it
may
be
possible
to
find
one
or
two
references
to
saint
bonaventure
or
to
wattenbach
which
are
incorrect
but
he
is
exceedingly
careful
in
rendering
the
sense
of
his
informants
and
neither
strains
the
tether
nor
outsteps
his
guide
the
original
words
in
very
many
cases
would
add
definiteness
and
a
touch
of
surprise
to
his
narrative
if
there
is
anywhere
the
least
infidelity
in
the
statement
of
an
author
meaning
it
is
in
the
denial
that
marsilius
the
imperial
theorist
and
the
creator
with
ockam
of
the
ghibelline
philosophy
that
has
ruled
the
world
was
a
friend
of
religious
liberty
marsilius
assuredly
was
not
a
whig
quite
as
much
as
any
guelph
he
desired
to
concentrate
power
not
to
limit
or
divide
it
of
the
sacred
immunities
of
conscience
he
had
no
clearer
vision
than
dante
but
he
opposed
persecution
in
the
shape
in
which
he
knew
it
and
the
patriarchs
of
european
emancipation
have
not
done
more
he
never
says
that
there
is
no
case
in
which
a
religion
may
be
proscribed
but
he
speaks
of
none
in
which
a
religion
may
be
imposed
he
discusses
not
intolerance
but
the
divine
authority
to
persecute
and
pleads
for
a
secular
law
it
does
not
appear
how
he
would
deal
with
a
thug

the
difference
is
slight
between
the
two
readings
one
asserts
that
marsilius
was
tolerant
in
effect
the
other
denies
that
he
was
tolerant
in
principle
lea
does
not
love
to
recognise
the
existence
of
much
traditional
toleration
few
lights
are
allowed
to
deepen
his
shadows
if
a
stream
of
tolerant
thought
descended
from
the
early
ages
to
the
time
when
the
companion
of
vespucci
brought
his
improbable
tale
from
utopia
then
the
views
of
bacon
of
dante
of
gerson
can
not
be
accounted
for
by
the
ascendency
of
a
unanimous
persuasion
it
is
because
all
men
were
born
to
the
same
inheritance
of
enforced
conformity
that
we
glide
so
easily
towards
the
studied
increase
of
pain
if
some
men
were
able
to
perceive
what
lay
in
the
other
scale
if
they
made
a
free
choice
after
deliberation
between
and
opinions
then
what
happened
is
not
assignable
to
invincible
causes
and
history
must
turn
from
general
and
easy
explanation
to
track
the
sinuosities
of
a
tangled
thread
in
lea
acceptation
of
ecclesiastical
history
intolerance
was
handed
down
as
a
rule
of
life
from
the
days
of
cyprian
and
the
few
who
shrank
from
the
gallows
and
the
flames
were
exceptions
were
men
navigating
craft
of
their
own
away
from
the
track
of
peter
even
in
his
own
age
he
is
not
careful
to
show
that
the
waldenses
opposed
persecution
not
in
but
in
the
necessary
sequence
of
thought
and
when
he
describes
eutychius
as
an
obscure
man
who
made
a
point
at
the
fifth
general
council
for
which
he
was
rewarded
with
the
patriarchate
of
constantinople
eutychius
who
was
already
patriarch
when
the
council
assembled
and
when
he
twice
tears
formosus
from
his
grave
to
parade
him
in
his
vestments
about
rome
we
may
suspect
that
the
perfect
grasp
of
documentary
history
from
the
twelfth
century
does
not
reach
backwards
in
a
like
degree
if
lea
stands
aloft
in
his
own
domain
as
an
accumulator
his
credit
as
a
judge
of
testimony
is
nearly
as
high
the
deciding
test
of
his
critical
sagacity
is
the
masterly
treatment
of
the
case
against
the
templars
they
were
condemned
without
mercy
by
church
and
state
by
priest
and
jurist
and
down
to
the
present
day
cautious
examiners
of
evidence
like
prutz
and
lavocat
give
a
faltering
verdict
in
the
face
of
many
credulous
forerunners
and
of
much
concurrent
testimony
lea
pronounces
positively
that
the
monster
trial
was
a
conspiracy
to
murder
and
every
adverse
proof
a
lie
his
immediate
predecessor
schottmüller
the
first
writer
who
ever
knew
the
facts
has
made
this
conclusion
easy
but
the
american
does
not
move
in
the
retinue
of
the
prussian
scholar
he
searches
and
judges
for
himself
and
in
his
estimate
of
the
chief
actor
in
the
tragedy
clement
he
judges
differently
he
rejects
as
forgeries
a
whole
batch
of
unpublished
confessions
and
he
points
out
that
a
bull
disliked
by
inquisitors
is
not
reproduced
entire
in
the
but
he
fails
to
give
the
collation
and
is
generally
jealous
about
admitting
readers
to
his
confidence
taking
them
into
consultation
and
producing
the
scales
in
the
case
of
delicieux
which
nearly
closes
the
drama
of
languedoc
he
consults
his
own
sources
independently
of
hauréau
and
in
the
end
adopts
the
marginal
statement
in
limborch
that
the
pope
aggravated
the
punishment
in
other
places
he
puts
his
trust
in
the
and
he
shows
no
reason
for
dismissing
the
different
account
there
given
of
the
death
of
delicieux

page
of
his
there
however
they
may
be
sought
in
vain
some
dubious
instances
are
mentioned
and
the
dissatisfied
inquirer
is
passed
on
to
the
fors
de
béarn
and
to
lagrèze
and
is
informed
that
louis
veuillot
raised
an
unprofitable
dust
upon
the
subject
i
remember
that
veuillot
in
his
boastful
scorn
for
book
learning
made
no
secret
that
he
took
up
the
cause
because
the
church
was
attacked
but
got
his
facts
from
somebody
else
graver
men
than
veuillot
have
shared
his
conclusion
sir
henry
maine
having
looked
into
the
matter
in
his
quick
decisive
way
declared
that
an
instance
of
the
du
was
as
rare
as
the
wandering
jew
in
resting
his
case
on
the
pyrenees
lea
shows
his
usual
judgment
but
his
very
confident
note
is
a
too
easy
and
contemptuous
way
of
settling
a
controversy
which
is
still
wearily
extant
from
spain
to
silesia
in
which
some
new
fact
comes
to
light
every
year
and
drops
into
obscurity
riddled
with
the
shafts
of
critics
an
instance
of
too
facile
use
of
authorities
occurs
at
the
siege
of
béziers
a
fervent
cistercian
contemporary
informs
us
that
when
arnaud
was
asked
whether
the
catholics
should
be
spared
he
feared
the
heretics
would
escape
by
feigning
orthodoxy
and
fiercely
replied
them
all
for
god
knows
his
own
caesarius
to
whom
we
owe
the
was
a
cistercian
and
a
contemporary
but
he
was
not
so
fervent
as
that
for
he
tells
it
as
a
report
not
as
a
fact
with
a
caution
which
ought
not
to
have
evaporated
fertur
dixisse
caedite
eos

dominus
qui

the
catholic
defenders
had
been
summoned
to
separate
from
the
cathari
and
had
replied
that
they
were
determined
to
share
their
fate
it
was
then
resolved
to
make
an
example
which
we
are
assured
bore
fruit
afterwards
the
hasty
zeal
of
citeaux
adopted
the
speech
of
the
abbot
and
gave
it
currency
but
its
rejection
by
the
french
scholars
tamizey
de
larroque
and
auguste
molinier
was
a
warning
against
presenting
it
with
a
smooth
surface
as
a
thing
tested
and
ascertained
lea
in
other
passages
has
shown
his
disbelief
in
caesarius
of
heisterbach
and
knows
that
history
written
in
reliance
upon
him
would
be
history
fit
for
the
moon
words
as
ferocious
are
recorded
of
another
legate
at
a
different
siege
langlois

philippe
le
their
tragic
significance
for
history
is
not
in
the
mouth
of
an
angry
crusader
at
the
storming
of
a
fortress
but
in
the
pen
of
an
inoffensive
monk
watching
and
praying
under
the
peaceful
summit
of
the
seven
mountains
lea
undertakes
to
dispute
no
doctrine
and
to
propose
no
moral
he
starts
with
an
avowed
desire
not
to
say
what
may
be
construed
injuriously
to
the
character
or
feelings
of
men
he
writes
pure
history
and
is
methodically
oblivious
of
applied
history
the
broad
and
sufficient
realm
of
fact
is
divided
by
a
scientific
frontier
from
the
outer
world
of
interested
argument
beyond
the
frontier
he
has
no
cognisance
and
neither
aspires
to
inflame
passions
nor
to
compose
the
great
eirenikon
those
who
approach
with
love
or
hatred
are
to
go
empty
away
if
indeed
he
does
not
try
by
turns
to
fill
them
both
he
seeks
his
object
not
by
standing
aloof
as
if
the
name
that
perplexed
polyphemus
was
the
proper
name
for
historians
but
by
running
successively
on
opposing
lines
he
conceives
that
civilised
europe
owes
its
preservation
to
the
radiant
centre
of
religious
power
at
rome
and
is
grateful
to
innocent
iii
for
the
vigour
with
which
he
recognised
that
force
was
the
only
cure
for
the
pestiferous
opinions
of
misguided
zealots
one
of
his
authorities
is
the
inquisitor
bernardus
guidonis
and
there
is
no
writer
whom
in
various
shapes
he
quotes
so
often
but
when
guidonis
says
that
dolcino
and
margarita
suffered
juditium
lea
is
careful
to
vindicate
the
clergy
from
the
blame
of
their
sufferings
from
a
distinction
which
he
draws
between
despotism
and
its
abuse
and
from
a
phrase
disparaging
to
elections
about
rivers
that
can
not
rise
above
the
level
of
their
source
it
would
appear
that
lea
is
not
under
compulsion
to
that
rigid
liberalism
which
by
repressing
the
and
applying
the
main
rules
of
morality
all
round
converts
history
into
a
frightful
monument
of
sin
yet
in
the
wake
of
passages
which
push
the
praises
of
authority
to
the
verge
of
irony
dire
denunciations
follow
when
the
author
looks
back
upon
his
labours
he
discerns
a
scene
of
almost
unrelieved
blackness
he
avers
that
the
deliberate
burning
alive
of
a
human
being
simply
for
difference
of
belief
is
an
atrocity
and
speaks
of
a
fiendish
legislation
an
infernal
curiosity
a
seemingly
causeless
ferocity
which
appears
to
persecute
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
persecuting
the
inquisition
is
energetic
only
in
evil
it
is
a
standing
mockery
of
justice
perhaps
the
most
iniquitous
that
the
arbitrary
cruelty
of
man
has
ever
devised
this
is
not
the
protest
of
wounded
humanity
the
righteous
resolve
to
beware
of
doctrine
has
not
been
strictly
kept
in
the
private
judgment
of
the
writer
the
thinking
of
the
middle
ages
was
sophistry
and
their
belief
superstition
for
the
erring
and
suffering
mass
of
mankind
he
has
an
enlightened
sympathy
for
the
intricacies
of
speculation
he
has
none
he
cherishes
a
disbelief
theological
or
inductive
it
matters
not
in
sinners
rescued
by
repentance
and
in
blessings
obtained
by
prayer
between
remitted
guilt
and
remitted
punishment
he
draws
a
vanishing
line
that
makes
it
doubtful
whether
luther
started
from
the
limits
of
purgatory
or
the
limits
of
hell
he
finds
that
it
was
a
universal
precept
to
break
faith
with
heretics
that
it
was
no
arbitrary
or
artificial
innovation
to
destroy
them
but
the
faithful
outcome
of
the
traditional
spirit
of
the
church
he
hints
that
the
horror
of
sensuality
may
be
easily
carried
too
far
and
that
saint
francis
of
assisi
was
in
truth
not
very
much
removed
from
a
worshipper
of
the
devil
prescott
i
think
conceived
a
resemblance
between
the
god
of
montezuma
and
the
god
of
torquemada
but
he
saw
and
suspected
less
than
his
more
learned
countryman
if
any
life
was
left
in
the
strappado
and
the
samarra
no
book
would
deserve
better
than
this
description
of
their
vicissitudes
to
go
the
way
of
its
author
and
to
fare
with
the
flagrant
volume
snatched
from
the
burning
at
champel
which
is
still
exhibited
to
unitarian
pilgrims
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
in
other
characteristic
places
we
are
taught
to
observe
the
agency
of
human
passion
ambition
avarice
and
pride
and
wade
through
oceans
of
unvaried
evil
with
that
sense
of
dejection
which
comes
from
or
the
de
la
france
books
which
affect
the
mind
by
the
pressure
of
repeated
instances
the
inquisition
is
not
merely
the
monstrous
offspring
of
mistaken
zeal
but
it
is
utilised
by
selfish
greed
and
lust
of
power
no
piling
of
secondary
motives
will
confront
us
with
the
true
cause
some
of
those
who
fleshed
their
swords
with
preliminary
bloodshed
on
their
way
to
the
holy
war
may
have
owed
their
victims
money
some
who
in
shared
the
worst
crime
that
christian
nations
have
committed
perhaps
believed
that
jews
spread
the
plague
but
the
problem
is
not
there
neither
credulity
nor
cupidity
is
equal
to
the
burden
it
needs
no
weighty
scholar
pressed
down
and
running
over
with
the
produce
of
immense
research
to
demonstrate
how
common
men
in
a
barbarous
age
were
tempted
and
demoralised
by
the
tremendous
power
over
pain
and
death
and
hell
we
have
to
learn
by
what
reasoning
process
by
what
ethical
motive
men
trained
to
charity
and
mercy
came
to
forsake
the
ancient
ways
and
made
themselves
cheerfully
familiar
with
the
mysteries
of
the
the
perpetual
prison
and
the
stake
and
this
cleared
away
when
it
has
been
explained
why
the
gentlest
of
women
chose
that
the
keeper
of
her
conscience
should
be
conrad
of
marburg
and
inversely
how
that
relentless
slaughterer
directed
so
pure
a
penitent
as
saint
elizabeth
a
larger
problem
follows
after
the
first
generation
we
find
that
the
strongest
the
most
original
the
most
independent
minds
in
europe
men
born
for
opposition
who
were
neither
awed
nor
dazzled
by
canon
law
and
scholastic
theology
by
the
master
of
sentences
the
philosopher
and
the
gloss
fully
agreed
with
guala
and
raymond
and
we
ask
how
it
came
about
that
as
the
rigour
of
official
zeal
relaxed
and
there
was
no
compulsion
the
fallen
cause
was
taken
up
by
the
council
of
constance
the
university
of
paris
the
the
house
of
commons
and
the
first
reformers
that
ximenes
outdid
the
early
dominicans
while
vives
was
teaching
toleration
that
fisher
with
his
friend
handy
book
of
revolutionary
liberalism
in
his
pocket
declared
that
violence
is
the
best
argument
with
protestants
that
luther
excommunicated
for
condemning
persecution
became
a
persecutor
force
of
habit
will
not
help
us
nor
love
and
fear
of
authority
nor
the
unperceived
absorption
of
circumambient
fumes
somewhere
lea
perhaps
remembering
maryland
rhode
island
and
pennsylvania
speaks
of
what
was
universal
public
opinion
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
seventeenth
century
the
obstacle
to
this
theory
as
of
a
ship
labouring
on
the
bank
or
an
orb
in
the
tail
of
a
comet
is
that
the
opinion
is
associated
with
no
area
of
time
and
remains
unshaken
the
dominican
democrat
who
took
his
seat
with
the
mountain
in
never
swerved
from
the
principles
of
his
order
more
often
and
i
think
more
deliberately
lea
urges
that
intolerance
is
implied
in
the
definition
of
the
mediæval
church
that
it
sprang
from
the
root
and
grew
with
the
very
law
of
its
being
it
is
no
desperate
expedient
of
authority
at
bay
for
the
people
were
as
eager
as
their
pastors
to
send
the
heretic
to
the
stake
therefore
he
does
not
blame
the
perpetrator
but
his
inherited
creed
no
firm
believer
in
the
doctrine
of
exclusive
salvation
could
doubt
that
the
truest
mercy
lay
in
sweeping
away
the
emissaries
of
satan
with
fire
and
sword
what
we
have
here
is
the
logic
of
history
constraining
every
system
to
utter
its
last
word
to
empty
its
wallets
and
work
its
consequences
out
to
the
end
but
this
radical
doctrine
misguides
its
author
to
the
anachronism
that
as
early
as
the
first
leo
the
final
step
had
been
taken
and
the
church
was
definitely
pledged
to
the
suppression
of
heresy
at
whatever
cost
we
do
not
demand
that
historians
shall
compose
our
opinions
or
relieve
us
from
the
purifying
pains
of
thought
it
is
well
if
they
discard
dogmatising
if
they
defer
judgment
or
judge
with
the
philosopher
by
precepts
capable
of
being
a
guide
for
all
we
may
be
content
that
they
should
deny
themselves
and
repress
their
sentiments
and
wishes
when
these
are
contradictory
or
such
as
evidently
to
tinge
the
medium
an
unholy
curiosity
is
engendered
to
learn
distinctly
not
only
what
the
writer
knows
but
what
he
thinks
lea
has
a
malicious
pleasure
in
baffling
inquiry
into
the
principle
of
his
judgments
having
found
in
the
catechism
of
saint
sulpice
that
devout
catholics
are
much
on
a
par
with
the
fanatics
whose
sympathy
with
satan
made
the
holy
office
a
requisite
of
civilisation
and
having
by
his
exuberant
censure
prepared
us
to
hear
that
this
requisite
of
civilisation
might
well
seem
the
invention
of
demons
he
arrives
at
the
inharmonious
conclusion
that
it
was
wrought
and
worked
with
benefit
to
their
souls
by
sincere
and
godly
men
the
condemnation
of
hus
is
the
proper
test
because
it
was
the
extreme
case
of
all
the
council
was
master
of
the
situation
and
was
crowded
with
men
accustomed
to
disparage
the
authority
of
the
holy
see
and
to
denounce
its
acts
practically
there
was
no
pope
either
of
rome
or
avignon
the
inquisition
languished
there
was
the
plausible
plea
of
deference
to
the
emperor
and
his
passport
there
was
the
imperative
consideration
for
the
religious
future
of
bohemia
the
reforming
divines
were
free
to
pursue
their
own
scheme
of
justice
of
mercy
and
of
policy
the
scheme
they
pursued
has
found
an
assiduous
apologist
in
their
new
historian
to
accuse
the
good
fathers
of
constance
of
conscious
bad
faith
is
impossible
to
observe
the
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
the
most
conscientious
jurists
of
the
council
in
a
nutshell
if
the
result
was
inevitable
it
was
the
fault
of
the
system
and
not
of
the
judges
and
their
conscience
might
well
feel
satisfied
there
may
be
more
in
this
than
the
oratorical
precaution
of
a
scholar
wanting
nothing
who
chooses
to
be
discreet
rather
than
explicit
or
the
wavering
utterance
of
a
mind
not
always
strung
to
the
same
pitch
it
is
not
the
craving
to
rescue
a
favourite
or
to
clear
a
record
but
a
fusion
of
unsettled
doctrines
of
retrospective
contempt
there
is
a
demonstration
of
progress
in
looking
back
without
looking
up
in
finding
that
the
old
world
was
wrong
in
the
grain
that
the
kosmos
which
is
inexorable
to
folly
is
indifferent
to
sin
man
is
not
an
abstraction
but
a
manufactured
product
of
the
society
with
which
he
stands
or
falls
which
is
answerable
for
crimes
that
are
the
shadow
and
the
echo
of
its
own
nobler
vices
and
has
no
right
to
hang
the
rogue
it
rears
before
you
lash
the
detected
class
mulct
the
undetected
crime
without
a
culprit
the
unavenged
victim
who
perishes
by
no
man
fault
law
without
responsibility
the
virtuous
agent
of
a
vicious
cause
all
these
are
the
signs
and
pennons
of
a
philosophy
not
recent
but
rather
inarticulate
still
and
inchoate
which
awaits
analysis
by
professor
flint
no
propositions
are
simpler
or
more
comprehensive
than
the
two
that
an
incorrigible
misbeliever
ought
to
burn
or
that
the
man
who
burns
him
ought
to
hang
the
world
as
expanded
on
the
liberal
and
on
the
hegemonic
projection
is
patent
to
all
men
and
the
alternatives
that
lacordaire
was
bad
and
conrad
good
are
clear
in
all
their
bearings
they
are
too
gross
and
palpable
for
lea
he
steers
a
subtler
course
he
does
not
sentence
the
heretic
but
he
will
not
protect
him
from
his
doom
he
does
not
care
for
the
inquisitor
but
he
will
not
resist
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
to
establish
a
tenable
footing
on
that
narrow
but
needful
platform
is
the
epilogue
these
painful
volumes
want
that
we
may
not
be
found
with
the
traveller
who
discovered
a
precipice
to
the
right
of
him
another
to
the
left
and
nothing
between
their
profound
and
admirable
erudition
leads
up
like
hellwald
to
a
great
note
of
interrogation
when
we
find
the
carolina
and
the
savage
justice
of
tudor
judges
brought
to
bear
on
the
exquisitely
complex
psychological
revolution
that
proceeded
after
the
year
about
the
gulf
of
lyons
and
the
tyrrhene
sea
we
miss
the
historic
question
when
we
learn
that
priscillian
was
murdered
i
but
that
lechler
has
no
business
to
call
the
sentence
on
john
hus
ein
wahrer
justizmord
ii
and
then
again
that
the
burning
of
a
heretic
is
a
judicial
murder
after
all
i
we
feel
bereft
of
the
philosophic
answer
although
lea
gives
little
heed
to
pani
and
hefele
gams
and
du
boys
and
the
others
who
write
for
the
inquisition
without
pleading
ignorance
he
emphasises
a
belgian
who
lately
wrote
that
the
church
never
employed
direct
constraint
against
heretics
people
who
never
heard
of
the
belgian
will
wonder
that
so
much
is
made
of
this
conventional
figleaf
nearly
the
same
assertion
may
be
found
with
varieties
of
caution
and
of
confidence
in
a
catena
of
divines
from
bergier
to
newman
to
appear
unfamiliar
with
the
defence
exposes
the
writer
to
the
thrust
that
you
can
not
know
the
strength
or
the
weakness
of
a
case
until
you
have
heard
its
advocates
the
liberality
of
leo
which
has
yielded
a
splendid
and

the

denifle
supplied
with
all
the

would
produce

inadequate
the

of

stands
out
from
an
indistinct

the

darkened
by

of

fail
to
ensure
at
all

the
objective
and
delicate
handling
of
mediæval

the
vital
parts
are
protected
by
a
panoply
of

from
the
albigensian
crusade
to
the
fall
of
the
templars
and
to
that
franciscan
movement
wherein
the

lies
the

the

will
survive
the

the

seriously
invoke

as
the

the

import
of

is
in
a

than

who
said

he
writes
with
so
much

and
feeling
the
national
political
social

is
so
spontaneous
and
sincere
as
to
carry
a
very
large
measure
indeed
of
quiet

the

to
sweeten

lubricate
a

such
as
no

since

not

and
i
know
no
better
illustration
of
a
recent
saying
si
un
livre
porte
un
enseignement
ce
doit
être
malgré
son
auteur
par
la
force
même
des

raconte
if
our
countryman
has
not
the
chill
sententiousness
of
his
great
french
predecessor
his
portable
wisdom
and
detached
thoughts
he
has
made
a
far
deeper
study
of
real
life
apart
from
comparative
politics
and
the
european
investment
of
transatlantic
experience
one
of
the
very
few
propositions
which
he
has
taken
straight
from
tocqueville
is
also
one
of
the
few
which
a
determined
would
be
able
to
contest
for
they
both
say
that
the
need
for
two
chambers
has
become
an
axiom
of
political
science
i
will
admit
that
the
doctrine
of
paine
and
franklin
and
samuel
adams
which
the
pennsylvanian
example
and
the
authority
of
turgot
made
so
popular
in
france
is
confuted
by
the
argument
of
laboulaye

une
condition
essentielle
de

la
seule

but
it
may
be
urged
that
a
truth
which
is
disputed
is
not
an
axiom
and
serious
men
still
imagine
a
state
of
things
in
which
an
undivided
legislature
is
necessary
to
resist
a
too
powerful
executive
whilst
two
chambers
can
be
made
to
curb
and
neutralise
each
other
both
tocqueville
and
turgot
are
said
to
have
wavered
on
this
point
it
has
been
said
that
tocqueville
never
understood
the
federal
constitution
he
believed
to
his
last
edition
that
the
opening
words
of
the
first
section
all
legislative
powers
herein
granted
meant
tous
les
pouvoirs
législatifs
déterminés
par

story
thought
that
he
has
borrowed
the
greater
part
of
his
reflections
from
american
works
meaning
his
own
and
lieber
and
little
from
his
own
observation
the
french
minister
at
washington
described
his
book
as
intéressant
mais
fort
peu
exact
and
even
the
calls
it
brilliant
superficial
and
attractive
bryce
can
never
be
accused
of
imperfect
knowledge
or
penetration
of
undue
dependence
upon
others
or
of
writing
up
to
a
purpose
his
fault
is
elsewhere
this
scholar
distinguished
not
only
as
a
successful
writer
of
history
which
is
said
to
be
frequent
but
as
a
trained
and
professed
historian
which
is
rare
altogether
declines
the
jurisdiction
of
the
historical
review
his
contumacy
is
in
gross
black
and
white
i
have
had
to
resist
another
temptation
that
of
straying
off
into
history
three
stout
volumes
tell
how
things
are
without
telling
how
they
came
about
i
should
have
no
title
to
bring
them
before
this
tribunal
if
it
were
not
for
an
occasional
glimpse
at
the
past
if
it
were
not
for
a
strongly
marked
and
personal
philosophy
of
american
history
which
looms
behind
the
boss
and
the
boom
the
hoodlum
and
the
mugwump
there
is
a
valid
excuse
for
preferring
to
address
the
unhistoric
mind
the
process
of
development
by
which
the
america
of
tocqueville
became
the
america
of
lincoln
has
been
lately
described
with
a
fulness
of
knowledge
which
no
european
can
rival
readers
who
thirst
for
the
running
stream
can
plunge
and
struggle
through
several
thousand
pages
of
holst
and
it
is
better
to
accept
the
division
of
labour
than
to
take
up
ground
so
recently
covered
by
a
work
which
if
not
very
well
designed
or
well
composed
is
by
the
prodigious
digestion
of
material
the
most
instructive
ever
written
on
the
natural
history
of
federal
democracy
the
author
who
has
spent
twenty
years
on
american
debates
and
newspapers
began
during
the
pause
between
sadowa
and
wörth
when
germany
was
in
the
throes
of
political
concentration
that
made
the
empire
he
explains
with
complacency
how
another
irrepressible
conflict
between
centre
and
circumference
came
and
went
and
how
the
welfare
of
mankind
is
better
served
by
the
gathering
than
by
the
balance
or
dispersion
of
forces
like
gneist
and
tocqueville
he
thinks
of
one
country
while
he
speaks
of
another
he
knows
nothing
of
reticence
or
economy
in
the
revelation
of
private
opinion
and
he
has
none
of
bryce
cheery
indulgence
for
folly
and
error
but
when
the
british
author
refuses
to
devote
six
months
to
the
files
of
californian
journalism
he
leaves
the
german
master
of
his
allotted
field
the
actual
predominates
so
much
with
bryce
that
he
has
hardly
a
word
on
that
extraordinary
aspect
of
democracy
the
union
in
time
of
war
and
gives
no
more
than
a
passing
glance
at
the
confederate
scheme
of
government
of
which
a
northern
writer
said
the
invaluable
reforms
enumerated
should
be
adopted
by
the
united
states
with
or
without
a
reunion
of
the
seceded
states
and
as
soon
as
possible
there
are
points
on
which
some
additional
light
could
be
drawn
from
the
roaring
loom
of
time
in
the
chapter
on
spoils
it
is
not
stated
that
the
idea
belongs
to
the
ministers
of
george
iii
hamilton
argument
against
removals
is
mentioned
but
not
the
new

edition
of
with
the
marginal
note
that
had
changed
his
view
of
the
constitution
on
that
point
the
french
wars
of
speculation
and
plunder
are
spoken
of
but
to
give
honour
where
honour
is
due
it
should
be
added
that
they
were
an
american
suggestion
in
may
morris
wrote
to
two
of
his
friends
at
paris
i
see
no
means
of
extricating
you
from
your
troubles
but
that
which
most
men
would
consider
as
the
means
of
plunging
you
into
greater
i
mean
a
war
and
you
should
make
it
to
yourselves
a
war
of
men
to
your
neighbours
a
war
of
money
i
hear
you
cry
out
that
the
finances
are
in
a
deplorable
situation
this
should
be
no
obstacle
i
think
that
they
may
be
restored
during
war
better
than
in
peace
you
want
also
something
to
turn
men
attention
from
their
present
discontents
there
is
a
long
and
impartial
inquiry
into
parliamentary
corruption
as
practised
now
but
one
wishes
to
hear
so
good
a
judge
on
the
report
that
money
prevailed
at
some
of
the
of
american
history
on
the
imputations
cast
by
the
younger
adams
upon
his
ablest
contemporaries
on
the
story
told
by
another
president
of
representatives
who
received
accommodation
from
the
bank
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
pounds
apiece
during
its
struggle
with
jackson
america
as
known
to
the
man
in
the
cars
and
america
observed
in
the
roll
of
the
ages
do
not
always
give
the
same
totals
we
learn
that
the
best
capacity
of
the
country
is
withheld
from
politics
that
there
is
what
emerson
calls
a
gradual
withdrawal
of
tender
consciences
from
the
social
organisation
so
that
the
representatives
approach
the
level
of
the
constituents
yet
it
is
in
political
science
only
that
america
occupies
the
first
rank
there
are
six
americans
on
a
level
with
the
foremost
europeans
with
smith
and
turgot
mill
and
humboldt
five
of
these
were
secretaries
of
state
and
one
was
secretary
of
the
treasury
we
are
told
also
that
the
american
of
regards
the
national
institutions
with
a
confidence
sometimes
grotesque
but
this
is
a
sentiment
which
comes
down
not
from
washington
and
jefferson
but
from
grant
and
sherman
the
illustrious
founders
were
not
proud
of
their
accomplished
work
and
men
like
clay
and
adams
persisted
in
desponding
to
the
second
and
third
generation
we
have
to
distinguish
what
the
nation
owes
to
madison
and
marshall
and
what
to
the
army
of
the
potomac
for
men
minds
misgave
them
as
to
the
constitution
until
it
was
cemented
by
the
ordeal
and
the
sacrifice
of
civil
war
even
the
claim
put
forward
for
americans
as
the
providers
of
humour
for
mankind
seems
to
me
subject
to
the
same
limitation
people
used
to
know
how
often
or
how
seldom
washington
laughed
during
the
war
but
who
has
numbered
the
jokes
of
lincoln
although
bryce
has
too
much
tact
to
speak
as
freely
as
the
americans
themselves
in
the
criticism
of
their
government
he
insists
that
there
is
one
defect
which
they
insufficiently
acknowledge
by
law
or
custom
no
man
can
represent
any
district
but
the
one
he
resides
in
if
ten
statesmen
live
in
the
same
street
nine
will
be
thrown
out
of
work
it
is
worth
while
to
point
out
though
this
may
not
be
the
right
place
for
a
purely
political
problem
that
even
in
that
piece
of
censure
in
which
he
believes
himself
unsupported
by
his
friends
in
the
states
bryce
says
no
more
than
intelligent
americans
have
said
before
him
it
chances
that
several
of
them
have
discussed
this
matter
with
me
one
was
governor
of
his
state
and
another
is
among
the
compurgators
cited
in
the
preface
both
were
strongly
persuaded
that
the
usage
in
question
is
an
urgent
evil
others
i
am
bound
to
add
judged
differently
deeming
it
valuable
as
a
security
against
boulangism
an
object
which
can
be
attained
by
restricting
the
number
of
constituencies
to
be
addressed
by
the
same
candidate
the
two
american
presidents
who
agreed
in
saying
that
whig
and
tory
belong
to
natural
history
proposed
a
dilemma
which
bryce
wishes
to
elude
he
prefers
to
stand
between
the
two
and
to
resolve
general
principles
into
questions
of
expediency
probability
and
degree
the
wisest
statesman
is
he
who
best
holds
the
balance
between
liberty
and
order
the
sentiment
is
nearly
that
of
croker
and
de
quincey
and
it
is
plain
that
the
author
would
discard
the
vulgar
definition
that
liberty
is
the
end
of
government
and
that
in
politics
things
are
to
be
valued
as
they
minister
to
its
security
he
writes
in
the
spirit
of
john
adams
when
he
said
that
the
french
and
the
american
revolution
had
nothing
in
common
and
of
that
eulogy
of
as
the
true
restoration
on
which
burke
and
macaulay
spent
their
finest
prose
a
sentence
which
he
takes
from
judge
cooley
contains
the
brief
abstract
of
his
book
america
is
not
so
much
an
example
in
her
liberty
as
in
the
covenanted
and
enduring
securities
which
are
intended
to
prevent
liberty
degenerating
into
licence
and
to
establish
a
feeling
of
trust
and
repose
under
a
beneficent
government
whose
excellence
so
obvious
in
its
freedom
is
still
more
conspicuous
in
its
careful
provision
for
permanence
and
stability
bryce
declares
his
own
point
of
view
in
the
following
significant
terms
the
spirit
of
was
an
english
spirit
and
therefore
a
conservative
spirit
the
american
constitution
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
everything
which
has
power
to
win
the
obedience
and
respect
of
men
must
have
its
roots
deep
in
the
past
and
that
the
more
slowly
every
institution
has
grown
so
much
the
more
enduring
is
it
likely
to
prove
there
is
a
hearty
puritanism
in
the
view
of
human
nature
which
pervades
the
instrument
of
no
men
were
less
revolutionary
in
spirit
than
the
heroes
of
the
american
revolution
they
made
a
revolution
in
the
name
of
magna
charta
and
the
bill
of
rights
i
descry
a
bewildered
whig
emerging
from
the
third
volume
with
a
reverent
appreciation
of
ancestral
wisdom
and
the
eighteen
canons
of
dort
and
a
growing
belief
in
the
function
of
ghosts
to
make
laws
for
the
quick
when
the
last
valois
consulted
his
dying
mother
she
advised
him
that
anybody
can
cut
off
but
that
the
sewing
on
is
an
acquired
art
bryce
feels
strongly
for
the
men
who
practised
what
catharine
thought
so
difficult
and
he
stops
for
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
his
very
impersonal
treatise
to
deliver
a
panegyric
on
alexander
hamilton
nomini
nullum
par
his
merits
can
hardly
be
overstated
talleyrand
assured
ticknor
that
he
had
never
known
his
equal
seward
calls
him
the
ablest
and
most
effective
statesman
engaged
in
organising
and
establishing
the
union
macmaster
the
iconoclast
and
holst
poorly
endowed
with
the
gift
of
praise
unite
in
saying
that
he
was
the
foremost
genius
among
public
men
in
the
new
world
guizot
told
rush
that
was
the
greatest
work
known
to
him
in
the
application
of
elementary
principles
of
government
to
practical
administration
his
paradox
in
support
of
political
corruption
so
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
character
of
an
honest
man
was
repeated
to
the
letter
by
niebuhr
in
estimating
hamilton
we
have
to
remember
that
he
was
in
no
sense
the
author
of
the
constitution
in
the
convention
he
was
isolated
and
his
plan
was
rejected
in
written
before
he
was
thirty
he
pleaded
for
a
form
of
government
which
he
distrusted
and
disliked
he
was
out
of
sympathy
with
the
spirit
that
prevailed
and
was
not
the
true
representative
of
the
cause
like
madison
who
said
of
him
if
his
theory
of
government
deviated
from
the
republican
standard
he
had
the
candour
to
avow
it
and
the
greater
merit
of
faithfully
in
maturing
and
supporting
a
system
which
was
not
his
choice
the
development
of
the
constitution
so
far
as
it
continued
on
his
lines
was
the
work
of
marshall
barely
known
to
us
by
the
extracts
in
late
editions
of
the
says
story
could
do
little
more
than
state
the
objects
and
general
bearing
of
these
powers
and
functions
the
masterly
reasoning
of
the
has
followed
them
out
to
their
ultimate
results
and
boundaries
with
a
precision
and
clearness
approaching
as
near
as
may
be
to
mathematical
demonstration
morris
who
was
as
strong
as
hamilton
on
the
side
of
federalism
testifies
heavily
against
him
as
a
leader
more
a
theoretic
than
a
practical
man
he
was
not
sufficiently
convinced
that
a
system
may
be
good
in
itself
and
bad
in
relation
to
particular
circumstances
he
well
knew
that
his
favourite
form
was
inadmissible
unless
as
the
result
of
civil
war
and
i
suspect
that
his
belief
in
that
which
he
called
an
approaching
crisis
arose
from
a
conviction
that
the
kind
of
government
most
suitable
in
his
opinion
to
this
extensive
country
could
be
established
in
no
other
way
he
trusted
moreover
that
in
the
changes
and
chances
of
time
we
should
be
involved
in
some
war
which

was
of

the

indiscreet
he
knew
that
a

even
if

could
not
preserve
itself
in
this
country
he
never
failed
on
every
occasion
to
advocate
the
excellence
of
and
avow
his
attachment
to
monarchical

thus
meaning
very
well
he
acted

he
apprehended

his

the

adams
was

in

it
is
the
singular
superiority
of
hamilton
that
he
is
really
anxious
about
nothing
but
the
exceeding
difficulty
of
quelling
the
centrifugal
forces
and
that
no
kindred
and
coequal
powers
divide
his
attachment
or
intercept
his
view
therefore
he
is
the
most
scientific
of
conservative
thinkers
and
there
is
not
one
in
whom
the
doctrine
that
prefers
the

can
be
so
profitably
studied

adams
called
the

horrid
blasphemy
of
jefferson
we
are
assured
that
if
not
an
absolute
atheist
he
had
no
belief
in
a
future
existence

he
hoped
that
the
french

would

they

after

had

from

with

make
room
for
other
influences

in

to
speak

not
as

only
in
the

assiduously
lays
aside

had
allowed

take
up
neglected

he
would
have
had
to

would

laid
broader
by
far
than
the
superstructure

the

of

suffered

the
constitution
and

of
the
federal
government
did
not
practically
extend
those
principles
throughout
the
new
system
of
government
but
they
were
plainly
promulgated
in
the
declaration
of
independence
their
complete
development
and
reduction
to
practical
operation
constitute
the
progress
which
all
liberal
statesmen
desire
to
promote
and
the
end
of
that
progress
will
be
complete
political
equality
among
ourselves
and
the
extension
and
perfection
of
institutions
similar
to
our
own
throughout

a
passage
which
hamilton
editor
selects
as
the
keynote
of

the

rights
of

are
not

are

that
it

be
wrested

the
blackest

aggravated
guilt
those
were
the
days

divided

those
which

those
which
do

and
when

proclaimed
that

was
the
only
thing
that
could
do
the

by
robert

when
flint
former
work
appeared
a
critic
who
it
is
true
was
also
a
rival
objected
that
it
was
diffusely
written
what
then
occupied
three
hundred
and
thirty
pages
has
now
expanded
to
seven
hundred
and
suggests
a
doubt
as
to
the
use
of
criticism
it
must
at
once
be
said
that
the
increase
is
nearly
all
material
gain
the
author
does
not
cling
to
his
main
topic
and
as
he
insists
that
the
science
he
is
adumbrating
flourishes
on
the
study
of
facts
only
and
not
on
speculative
ideas
he
bestows
some
needless
attention
on
historians
who
professed
no
philosophy
or
who
like
daniel
and
velly
were
not
the
best
of
their
kind
here
and
there
as
in
the
account
of
condorcet
there
may
be
an
unprofitable
or
superfluous
sentence
but
on
the
whole
the
enlarged
treatment
of
the
philosophy
of
history
in
france
is
accomplished
not
by
expansion
but
by
solid
and
essential
addition
many
writers
are
included
whom
the
earlier
volume
passed
over
and
cousin
occupies
fewer
pages
now
than
in
by
the
aid
of
smaller
type
and
the
omission
of
a
passage
injurious
to
schelling
many
necessary
corrections
and
improvements
have
been
made
such
as
the
transfer
of
ballanche
from
theocracy
to
the
liberal
catholicism
of
which
he
is
supposed
to
be
the
founder
flint
unchallenged
superiority
consists
alike
in
his
familiarity
with
obscure
but
not
irrelevant
authors
whom
he
has
brought
into
line
and
in
his
scrupulous
fairness
towards
all
whose
attempted
systems
he
has
analysed
he
is
hearty
in
appreciating
talent
of
every
kind
but
he
is
discriminating
in
his
judgment
of
ideas
and
rarely
sympathetic
where
the
best
thoughts
of
the
ablest
men
are
to
be
displayed
it
would
be
tempting
to
present
an
array
of
luminous
points
or
a
chaplet
of
polished
gems
in
the
hands
of
such
artists
as
stahl
or
cousin
they
would
start
into
high
relief
with
a
convincing
lucidity
that
would
rouse
the
exhibited
writers
to
confess
that
they
had
never
known
they
were
so
clever
without
transfiguration
the
effect
might
be
attained
by
sometimes
stringing
the
most
significant
words
of
the
original
excepting
one
unduly
favoured
competitor
who
fills
two
pages
with
untranslated
french
there
is
little
direct
quotation
cournot
is
one
of
those
who
having
been
overlooked
at
first
are
here
raised
to
prominence
he
is
urgently
and
justly
recommended
to
the
attention
of
students
they
will
find
that
every
page
bears
the
impress
of
patient
independent
and
sagacious
thought
i
believe
i
have
not
met
with
a
more
genuine
thinker
in
the
course
of
my
investigations
he
was
a
man
of
the
finest
intellectual
qualities
of
a
powerful
and
absolutely
truthful
mind
but
then
we
are
warned
that
cournot
never
wrote
a
line
for
the
general
reader
and
accordingly
he
is
not
permitted
to
speak
for
himself

notice
he
says
that
the
republic
proclaimed
universal
suffrage
in
and
he
considers
it
a
triumph
for
the
party
of
lafayette
in
fact
it
was
the
triumph
of
an
opposite
school
of
those
legitimists
who
appealed
from
the
narrow
franchise
which
sustained
the
orleans
dynasty
to
the
nation
behind
it
the
chairman
of
the
constitutional
committee
was
a
legitimist
and
he
inspired
by
the
abbé
de
genoude
of
the
de
and
opposed
by
odilon
barrot
insisted
on
the
pure
logic
of
absolute
democracy
it
is
an
old
story
now
that
the
true
history
of
philosophy
is
the
true
evolution
of
philosophy
and
that
when
we
have
eliminated
whatever
has
been
damaged
by
contemporary
criticism
or
by
subsequent
advance
and
have
assimilated
all
that
has
survived
through
the
ages
we
shall
find
in
our
possession
not
only
a
record
of
growth
but
the
fruit
itself
this
is
not
the
way
in
which
flint
understands
the
building
up
of
his
department
of
knowledge
instead
of
showing
how
far
france
has
made
a
way
towards
the
untrodden
crest
he
describes
the
many
flowery
paths
discovered
by
the
french
which
lead
elsewhere
and
i
expect
that
in
coming
volumes
it
will
appear
that
hegel
and
buckle
vico
and
ferrari
are
scarcely
better
guides
than
laurent
or
littré
fatalism
and
retribution
race
and
nationality
the
test
of
success
and
of
duration
heredity
and
the
reign
of
the
invincible
dead
the
widening
circle
the
emancipation
of
the
individual
the
gradual
triumph
of
the
soul
over
the
body
of
mind
over
matter
reason
over
will
knowledge
over
ignorance
truth
over
error
right
over
might
liberty
over
authority
the
law
of
progress
and
perfectibility
the
constant
intervention
of
providence
the
sovereignty
of
the
developed
conscience
neither
these
nor
other
alluring
theories
are
accepted
as
more
than
illusions
or
flint
scarcely
avails
himself
of
them
even
for
his
foundations
or
his
skeleton
framework
his
critical
faculty
stronger
than
his
gift
of
adaptation
levels
obstructions
and
marks
the
earth
with
ruin
he
is
more
anxious
to
expose
the
strange
unreason
of
former
writers
the
inadequacy
of
their
knowledge
their
want
of
aptitude
in
induction
than
their
services
in
storing
material
for
the
use
of
successors
the
result
is
not
to
be
the
sifted
and
verified
wisdom
of
two
centuries
but
a
future
system
to
be
produced
when
the
rest
have
failed
by
an
exhaustive
series
of
vain
experiments
we
may
regret
to
abandon
many
brilliant
laws
and
attractive
generalisations
that
have
given
light
and
clearness
and
simplicity
and
symmetry
to
our
thought
but
it
is
certain
that
flint
is
a
close
and
powerful
reasoner
equipped
with
satisfying
information
and
he
establishes
his
contention
that
france
has
not
produced
a
classic
philosophy
of
history
and
is
still
waiting
for
its
adam
smith
or
jacob
grimm
the
kindred
topic
of
development
recurs
repeatedly
as
an
important
factor
in
modern
science
it
is
still
a
confused
and
unsettled
chapter
and
in
one
place
flint
seems
to
attribute
the
idea
to
bossuet
in
another
he
says
that
it
was
scarcely
entertained
in
those
days
by
protestants
and
not
at
all
by
catholics
in
a
third
he
implies
that
its
celebrity
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
owing
in
the
first
place
to
lamennais
the
passage
taken
from
vinet
in
which
bossuet
speaks
of
the
development
of
religion
is
inaccurately
rendered
his
words
are
the
same
which
on
another
page
are
rightly
translated
the

bossuet
was
the
most
powerful
adversary
the
theory
ever
encountered
it
was
not
so
alien
to
catholic
theology
as
is
here
stated
and
before
the
time
of
jurieu
is
more
often
found
among
catholic
than
protestant
writers
when
it
was
put
forward
in
guarded
dubious
and
evasive
terms
by
petavius
the
indignation
in
england
was
as
great
as
in
the
work
which
contained
it
the
most
learned
that
christian
theology
had
then
produced
could
not
be
reprinted

lest
it

to

the

which

found
it
so
difficult
to

in
those
days
was
an
expedient
an
hypothesis
and
not
even
the

that

little
understood
and
lightly
and
loosely
employed
is
proved
by
bossuet
himself
who
alludes
to
it
in
one
passage
as
if
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
subversion
of
his
theology

the
account
of
lamennais
suffers
from
the
defect
of
mixing
him
up
too
much
with
his
early
friends
no
doubt
he
owed
to
them
the
theory
that
carried
him
through
his
career
for
it
may
be
found
in
bonald
and
also
in
de
maistre
though
not
perhaps
in
the
volumes
he
had
already
published
it
was
less
original
than
he
at
first
imagined
for
the
english
divines
commonly
held
it
from
the
seventeenth
century
and
its
dirge
was
sung
only
the
other
day
by
the
bishop
of
gloucester
and
bristol
a
scottish
professor
would
even
be
justified
in
claiming
it
for
reid
but
of
course
it
was
lamennais
who
gave
it
most
importance
in
his
programme
and
in
his
life
and
his
theory
of
the
common
sense
the
theory
that
we
can
be
certain
of
truth
only
by
the
agreement
of
mankind
though
vigorously
applied
to
sustain
authority
in
state
and
church
gravitated
towards
multitudinism
and
marked
him
off
from
his
associates
when
he
said
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
christian
church
but
of
christianity
as
old
as
the
creation
and
the
development
he
meant
led
up
to
the
bible
and
ended
at
the
new
testament
instead
of
beginning
there
that
is
the
theory
which
he
made
so
famous
which
founded
his
fame
and
governed
his
fate
and
to
which
flint
words
apply
when
he
speaks
of
celebrity
in
that
sense
it
is
a
mistake
to
connect
lamennais
with
möhler
and
newman
and
i
do
not
believe
that
he
anticipated
their
teaching
in
spite
of
one
or
two
passages
which
do
not
on
the
face
of
them
bear
date
and
may
no
doubt
be
quoted
for
the
opposite
opinion
in
the
same
group
flint
represents
de
maistre
as
the
teacher
of
savigny
and
asserts
that
there
could
never
be
a
doubt
as
to
the
liberalism
of
chateaubriand
there
was
none
after
his
expulsion
from
office
but
there
was
much
reason
for
doubting
in
when
he
entreated
the
king
to
set
bounds
to
his
mercy
in
when
he
was
contributing
to
the
and
in
when
he
executed
the
mandate
of
the
absolute
monarchs
against
the
spanish
constitution
his
zeal
for
legitimacy
was
at
all
times
qualified
with
liberal
elements
but
they
never
became
consistent
or
acquired
the
mastery
until
de
maistre
and
savigny
covered
the
same
ground
at
one
point
they
both
subjected
the
future
to
the
past
this
could
serve
as
an
argument
for
absolutism
and
theocracy
and
on
that
account
was
lovely
in
the
eyes
of
de
maistre
if
it
had
been
an
argument
the
other
way
he
would
have
cast
it
off
savigny
had
no
such
ulterior
purpose
his
doctrine
that
the
living
are
not
their
own
masters
could
serve
either
cause
he
rejected
a
mechanical
fixity
and
held
that
whatever
has
been
made
by
process
of
growth
shall
continue
to
grow
and
suffer
modification
his
theory
of
continuity
has
this
significance
in
political
science
that
it
supplied
a
basis
for
conservatism
apart
from
absolutism
and
compatible
with
freedom
and
as
he
believed
that
law
depends
on
national
tradition
and
character
he
became
indirectly
and
through
friends
a
founder
of
the
theory
of
nationality
the
one
writer
whom
flint
refuses
to
criticise
because
he
too
nearly
agrees
with
him
is
renouvier
taking
this
avowal
in
conjunction
with
two
or
three
indiscretions
on
other
pages
we
can
make
a
guess
not
at
the
system
itself
which
is
to
console
us
for
so
much
deviation
but
at
its
tendency
and
spirit
the
fundamental
article
is
belief
in
divine
government
as
kant
beheld
god
in
the
firmament
of
heaven
so
too
we
can
see
him
in
history
on
earth
unless
a
man
is
determined
to
be
an
atheist
he
must
acknowledge
that
the
experience
of
mankind
is
a
decisive
proof
in
favour
of
religion
as
providence
is
not
absolute
but
reigns
over
men
destined
to
freedom
its
method
is
manifested
in
the
law
of
progress
here
however
flint
in
his
agreement
with
renouvier
is
not
eager
to
fight
for
his
cause
and
speaks
with
a
less
jubilant
certitude
he
is
able
to
conceive
that
providence
may
attain
its
end
without
the
condition
of
progress
that
the
divine
scheme
would
not
be
frustrated
if
the
world
governed
by
omnipotent
wisdom
became
steadily
worse
assuming
progress
as
a
fact
if
not
a
law
there
comes
the
question
wherein
it
consists
how
it
is
measured
where
is
its
goal
not
religion
for
the
middle
ages
are
an
epoch
of
decline
catholicism
has
since
lost
so
much
ground
as
to
nullify
the
theories
of
bossuet
whilst
protestantism
never
succeeded
in
france
either
after
the
reformation
when
it
ought
to
have
prevailed
nor
after
the
revolution
when
it
ought
not
the
failure
to
establish
the
protestant
church
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
to
which
quinet
attributes
the
breakdown
of
the
revolution
and
which
napoleon
regretted
almost
in
the
era
of
his
concordat
is
explained
by
flint
on
the
ground
that
protestants
were
in
a
minority
but
so
they
were
in
and
after
the
wars
of
religion
and
it
is
not
apparent
why
a
philosopher
who
does
not
prefer
orthodoxy
to
liberty
should
complain
that
they
achieved
nothing
better
than
toleration
he
disproves
bossuet
view
by
that
process
of
deliverance
from
the
church
which
is
the
note
of
recent
centuries
and
from
which
there
is
no
going
back
on
the
future
i
will
not
enlarge
because
i
am
writing
at
present
in
the
historical
not
the
prophetical
review
but
some
things
were
not
so
clear
in
france
in
as
they
are
now
at
edinburgh
the
predominance
of
protestant
power
was
not
foreseen
except
by
those
who
disputed
whether
rome
would
perish
in
or
about
the
destined
power
of
science
to
act
upon
religion
had
not
been
proved
by
newton
or
simon
no
man
was
able
to
forecast
the
future
experience
of
america
or
to
be
sure
that
observations
made
under
the
reign
of
authority
would
be
confirmed
by
the
reign
of
freedom
if
the
end
be
not
religion
is
it
morality
humanity
civilisation
knowledge
in
the
german
chapters
of
flint
was
severe
upon
hegel
and
refused
his
notion
that
the
development
of
liberty
is
the
soul
of
history
as
crude
and
misunderstood
he
is
more
lenient
now
and
affirms
that
liberty
occupies
the
final
summit
that
it
profits
by
all
the
good
that
is
in
the
world
and
suffers
by
all
the
evil
that
it
pervades
strife
and
inspires
endeavour
that
it
is
almost
if
not
altogether
the
sign
and
the
prize
and
the
motive
in
the
onward
and
upward
advance
of
the
race
for
which
christ
was
crucified
as
that
refined
essence
which
draws
sustenance
from
all
good
things
it
is
clearly
understood
as
the
product
of
civilisation
with
its
complex
problems
and
scientific
appliances
not
as
the
elementary
possession
of
the
noble
savage
which
has
been
traced
so
often
to
the
primeval
forest
on
the
other
hand
if
sin
not
only
tends
to
impair
but
does
inevitably
impair
and
hinder
it
providence
is
excluded
from
its
own
mysterious
sphere
which
as
it
is
not
the
suppression
of
all
evil
and
present
punishment
of
wrong
should
be
the
conversion
of
evil
into
an
instrument
to
serve
the
higher
purpose
but
although
flint
has
come
very
near
to
hegel
and
michelet
and
seemed
about
to
elevate
their
teaching
to
a
higher
level
and
a
wider
view
he
ends
by
treating
it
coldly
as
a
partial
truth
requiring
supplement
and
bids
us
wait
until
many
more
explorers
have
recorded
their
soundings
that
with
the
trained
capacity
for
misunderstanding
and
the
smouldering
dissent
proper
to
critics
i

not
mislead
any
