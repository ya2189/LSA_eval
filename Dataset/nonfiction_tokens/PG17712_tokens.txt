preface
this
book
and
the
accompanying
map
is
chiefly
intended
for
the
use
of
lunar
observers
but
it
is
hoped
it
may
be
acceptable
to
many
who
though
they
can
not
strictly
be
thus
described
take
a
general
interest
in
astronomy
the
increasing
number
of
those
who
possess
astronomical
telescopes
and
devote
more
or
less
of
their
leisure
in
following
some
particular
line
of
research
is
shown
by
the
great
success
in
recent
years
of
societies
such
as
the
british
astronomical
association
with
its
several
branches
the
astronomical
society
of
the
pacific
and
similar
institutions
in
various
parts
of
the
world
these
societies
are
not
only
doing
much
in
popularising
the
sublimest
of
the
sciences
but
are
the
means
of
developing
and
organising
the
capabilities
of
their
members
by
discouraging
aimless
and
desultory
observations
and
by
pointing
out
how
individual
effort
may
be
utilised
and
made
of
permanent
value
in
almost
every
department
of
astronomy
the
work
of
the
astronomer
like
that
of
the
votary
of
almost
every
other
science
is
becoming
every
year
more
and
more
specialised
and
among
its
manifold
subdivisions
the
study
of
the
physical
features
of
the
moon
is
undoubtedly
increasing
in
popularity
and
importance
to
those
who
are
pursuing
such
observations
it
is
believed
that
this
book
will
be
a
useful
companion
to
the
telescope
and
convenient
for
reference
great
care
has
been
taken
in
the
preparation
of
the
map
which
so
far
as
the
positions
of
the
various
objects
represented
are
concerned
is
based
on
the
last
edition
of
beer
and
madler
chart
and
on
the
more
recent
and
much
larger
and
elaborate
map
of
schmidt
while
as
regards
the
shape
and
details
of
most
of
the
formations
the
author
drawings
and
a
large
number
of
photographs
have
been
utilised
even
on
so
small
a
scale
as
eighteen
inches
to
the
moon
diameter
more
detail
might
have
been
inserted
but
this
at
the
expense
of
distinctness
would
have
detracted
from
the
value
of
the
map
for
handy
reference
in
the
usually
dim
light
of
the
observatory
without
adding
to
its
utility
in
other
ways
every
named
formation
is
prominently
shown
and
most
other
features
of
interest
including
the
principal
are
represented
though
as
regards
these
no
attempt
is
made
to
indicate
all
their
manifold
details
and
ramifications
which
to
do
effectually
would
in
very
many
instances
require
a
map
on
a
much
larger
scale
than
any
that
has
yet
appeared
the
insertion
of
meridian
lines
and
parallels
of
latitude
at
every
ten
degrees
and
the
substitution
of
names
for
reference
numbers
will
add
to
the
usefulness
of
the
map
with
respect
to
the
text
a
large
proportion
of
the
objects
in
the
catalogue
and
in
the
appendix
have
been
observed
and
drawn
by
the
author
many
times
during
the
last
thirty
years
and
described
in
and
other
publications
he
has
had
besides
the
advantage
of
consulting
excellent
sketches
by
mr
maw
sheldon
mee
hallowes
smart
gordon
davis
herr
brenner
herr
krieger
corder
and
other
members
of
the
british
astronomical
association
through
the
courtesy
of
professor
holden
director
of
the
lick
observatory
and
prinz
of
the
royal
observatory
of
brussels
many
beautiful
photographs
and
direct
photographic
enlargements
have
been
available
as
have
also
the
exquisite
heliogravures
received
by
the
author
from
weinek
director
of
the
imperial
observatory
of
prague
and
the
admirable
examples
of
the
photographic
work
of
mm
paul
and
prosper
henry
of
the
paris
observatory
which
are
occasionally
published
in
the
numerous
representations
of
lunar
objects
which
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
that
storehouse
of
astronomical
information
english
and
the
invaluable
notes
in
celestial
objects
for
common
telescopes
and
in
various
periodicals
by
the
late
rev
prebendary
webb
to
whom
selenography
and
astronomy
generally
owe
so
much
have
also
been
consulted
as
a
rule
all
the
more
prominent
and
important
features
are
described
though
very
frequently
interesting

are
referred
to
which
from
their
minuteness

introduction
we
know
both
by
tradition
and
published
records
that
from
the
earliest
times
the
faint
grey
and
light
spots
which
diversify
the
face
of
our
satellite
excited
the
wonder
and
stimulated
the
curiosity
of
mankind
giving
rise
to
suppositions
more
or
less
crude
and
erroneous
as
to
their
actual
nature
and
significance
it
is
true
that
anaxagoras
five
centuries
before
our
era
and
probably
other
philosophers
preceding
him
certainly
plutarch
at
a
much
later
date
taught
that
these
delicate
markings
and
differences
of
tint
obvious
to
every
one
with
normal
vision
point
to
the
existence
of
hills
and
valleys
on
her
surface
the
latter
maintaining
that
the
irregularities
of
outline
presented
by
the
terminator
or
line
of
demarcation
between
the
illumined
and
unillumined
portion
of
her
spherical
superficies
are
due
to
mountains
and
their
shadows
but
more
than
fifteen
centuries
elapsed
before
the
truth
of
this
sagacious
conjecture
was
unquestionably
demonstrated
selenography
as
a
branch
of
observational
astronomy
dates
from
the
spring
of
when
galileo
directed
his
optic
tube
to
the
moon
and
in
the
following
year
in
the
or
the
intelligencer
of
the
stars
gave
to
an
astonished
and
incredulous
world
an
account
of
the
unsuspected
marvels
it
revealed
in
this
remarkable
little
book
we
have
the
first
attempt
to
represent
the
telescopic
aspect
of
the
visible
surface
in
the
five
rude
woodcuts
representing
the
curious
features
he
perceived
thereon
whose
form
and
arrangement
he
tells
us
reminded
him
of
the
ocelli
on
the
feathers
of
a
peacock
tail
a
quaint
but
not
altogether
inappropriate
simile
to
describe
the
appearance
of
groups
of
the
larger
partially
illuminated
by
the
sun
when
seen
in
a
small
telescope
the
bright
and
dusky
areas
so
obvious
to
the
unaided
sight
were
found
by
galileo
to
be
due
to
a
very
manifest
difference
in
the
character
of
the
lunar
surface
a
large
portion
of
the
northern
hemisphere
and
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
quadrant
being
seen
to
consist
of
large
grey
monotonous
tracts
often
bordered
by
lofty
mountains
while
the
remainder
of
the
superficies
was
much
more
conspicuously
brilliant
and
moreover
included
by
far
the
greater
number
of
those
curious
mountains
and
other
extraordinary
features
whose
remarkable
aspect
and
peculiar
arrangement
first
attracted
his
attention
struck
by
the
analogy
which
these
contrasted
regions
present
to
the
land
and
water
surfaces
of
our
globe
he
suspected
that
the
former
are
represented
on
the
moon
by
the
brighter
and
more
rugged
and
the
latter
by
the
smoother
and
more
level
areas
a
view
however
which
kepler
more
distinctly
formulated
in
the
dictum
do
maculas
esse
maria
do
lucidas
esse
terras
besides
making
a
rude
lunar
chart
he
estimated
the
heights
of
some
of
the
mountains
by
measuring
the
distance
from
the
terminator
of
their
bright
summit
peaks
when
they
were
either
coming
into
or
passing
out
of
sunlight
and
though
his
method
was
incapable
of
accuracy
and
his
results
consequently
untrustworthy
it
served
to
demonstrate
the
immense
altitude
of
these
circumvallations
and
to
show
how
greatly
they
exceed
any
mountains
on
the
earth
if
the
relative
dimensions
of
the
two
globes
are
taken
into
consideration
before
the
close
of
the
century
when
selenography
first
became
possible
hevel
of
dantzig
scheiner
langrenus
cosmographer
to
the
king
of
spain
riccioli
the
jesuit
astronomer
of
bologna
and
dominic
cassini
the
celebrated
french
astronomer
greatly
extended
the
knowledge
of
the
moon
surface
and
published
drawings
of
various
phases
and
charts
which
though
very
rude
and
incomplete
were
a
clear
advance
upon
what
galileo
with
his
inferior
optical
means
had
been
able
to
accomplish
langrenus
and
after
him
hevel
gave
distinctive
names
to
the
various
formations
mainly
derived
from
terrestrial
physical
features
for
which
riccioli
subsequently
substituted
those
of
philosophers
mathematicians
and
other
celebrities
and
cassini
determined
by
actual
measurement
the
relative
position
of
many
of
the
principal
objects
on
the
disc
thus
laying
the
foundation
of
an
accurate
system
of
lunar
topography
while
the
labours
of
mayer
and
schroter
in
the
last
century
and
of
lohrmann
madler
neison
nevill
schmidt
and
other
observers
in
the
present
have
been
mainly
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
minuter
detail
of
the
moon
and
its
physical
characteristics
as
was
manifest
to
the
earliest
telescopic
observers
its
visible
surface
is
clearly
divisible
into
strongly
contrasted
areas
differing
both
in
colour
and
structural
character
somewhat
less
than
half
of
what
we
see
of
it
consists
of
comparatively
level
dark
tracts
some
of
them
very
many
thousands
of
square
miles
in
extent
the
monotony
of
whose
dusky
superficies
is
often
unrelieved
for
great
distances
by
any
prominent
object
while
the
remainder
everywhere
manifestly
brighter
is
not
only
more
rugged
and
uneven
but
is
covered
to
a
much
greater
extent
with
numbers
of
formations
differing
widely
in
size
classed
as
craters
craterlets
the
latter
bearing
a
great
outward
resemblance
to
some
terrestrial
volcanoes
and
mountain
ranges
of
vast
proportions
isolated
hills
and
other
features
though
nothing
resembling
sheets
of
water
either
of
small
or
large
extent
have
ever
been
detected
on
the
surface
the
superficial
resemblance
in
small
telescopes
of
the
large
grey
tracts
to
the
appearance
which
we
may
suppose
our
terrestrial
lakes
and
oceans
would
present
to
an
observer
on
the
moon
naturally
induced
the
early
selenographers
to
term
them
maria
or
seas
a
convenient
name
which
is
still
maintained
without
however
implying
that
these
areas
as
we
now
see
them
are
or
ever
were
covered
with
water
some
however
regard
them
as
old
from
which
every
trace
of
fluid
owing
to
some
unknown
cause
has
vanished
and
that
the
folds
and
wrinkles
the
ridges
swellings
and
other
peculiarities
of
structure
observed
upon
them
represent
some
of
the
results
of
alluvial
action
it
is
of
course
possible
and
even
probable
that
at
a
remote
epoch
in
the
evolution
of
our
satellite
these
lower
regions
were
occupied
by
water
but
that
their
surface
as
it
now
appears
is
actually
this
old
seems
to
be
less
likely
than
that
it
represents
the
consolidated
crust
of
some
fluid
or
viscous
material
possibly
of
a
basaltic
type
which
has
welled
forth
from
orifices
or
rents
communicating
with
the
interior
and
overspread
and
partially
filled
up
these
immense
hollows
more
or
less
overwhelming
and
destroying
many
formations
which
stood
upon
them
before
this
catastrophe
took
place
though
this
like
many
other
speculations
of
a
similar
character
relating
to
lunar
geology
must
remain
at
least
for
the
present
as
a
mere
hypothesis
indications
of
this
partial
destruction
by
some
agency
or
other
is
almost
everywhere
apparent
in
those
formations
which
border
the
seas
as
for
example
fracastorius
in
the
mare
nectaris
le
monnier
in
the
mare
serenitatis
pitatus
and
hesiodus
on
the
south
side
of
the
mare
nubium
doppelmayer
in
the
mare
humorum
and
in
many
other
situations
while
no
observer
can
fail
to
notice
innumerable
instances
of
more
or
less
complete
obliteration
and
ruin
among
objects
within
these
areas
in
the
form
of
obscure
rings
mere
scars
on
the
surface
dusky
craters
circular
arrangements
of
isolated
hills
reminding
one
of
the
monoliths
of
a
druidical
temple
all
of
which
we
are
justified
in
concluding
were
at
one
time
formations
of
a
normal
type
it
has
been
held
by
some
selenologists
and
schmidt
appears
to
be
of
the
number
that
seeing
the
comparative
scarcity
of
large
and
other
massive
formations
on
the
maria
these
grey
plains
represent
as
it
were
a
picture
of
the
primitive
surface
of
the
moon
before
it
was
disturbed
by
the
operations
of
interior
forces
but
this
view
affords
no
explanation
of
the
undoubted
existence
of
the
relics
of
an
earlier
lunar
world
beneath
their
smooth
superficies
leaving
however
these
considerations
for
a
more
particular
description
of
the
maria
it
is
clearly
impossible
in
referring
to
their
level
relatively
to
the
higher
and
brighter
land
surface
of
the
moon
to
appeal
to
any
hypsometrical
standard
all
that
is
known
in
this
respect
is
that
they
are
invariably
lower
than
the
latter
and
that
some
sink
to
a
greater
depth
than
others
or
in
other
words
that
they
do
not
all
form
a
part
of
the
same
sphere
though
they
are
more
or
less
of
a
hue
some
of
them
approximating
very
closely
to
that
of
the
pigment
known
as
payne
grey
the
tone
of
course
depends
upon
the
angle
at
which
the
solar
rays
impinge
on
that
particular
portion
of
the
surface
under
observation
speaking
generally
they
are
as
would
follow
from
optical
considerations
conspicuously
darker
when
viewed
near
the
terminator
or
when
the
sun
is
either
rising
or
setting
upon
them
than
under
a
more
vertical
angle
of
illumination
but
even
when
it
is
possible
to
compare
their
colour
by
under
similar
solar
altitudes
it
is
found
that
not
only
are
some
of
the
maria
as
a
whole
notably
darker
than
others
but
nearly
all
of
them
exhibit
inequalities
of
hue
which
under
good
atmospheric
and
instrumental
conditions
are
especially
remarkable
under
such
circumstances
i
have
frequently
seen
the
surface
in
many
places
covered
with
minute
glittering
points
of
light
shining
with
a
silvery
lustre
intermingled
with
darker
spots
and
a
network
of
streaks
far
too
delicate
and
ethereal
to
represent
in
a
drawing
in
addition
to
these
contrasts
and
differences
in
the
sombre
tone
of
these
extended
plains
many
observers
have
remarked
traces
of
a
yellow
or
green
tint
on
the
surface
of
some
of
them
for
example
the
mare
imbrium
and
the
mare
frigoris
appear
under
certain
conditions
to
be
of
a
dirty
hue
the
central
parts
of
the
mare
humorum
dusky
green
and
part
of
the
mare
serenitatis
and
the
mare
crisium
light
green
while
the
palus
somnii
has
been
noted
a
yellow
to
these
may
be
added
the
district
round
taruntius
in
the
mare
foecunditatis
and
portions
of
other
regions
referred
to
in
the
catalogue
where
i
have
remarked
a
very
decided
sepia
colour
under
a
low
sun
it
has
been
attempted
to
account
for
these
phenomena
by
supposing
the
existence
of
some
kind
of
vegetation
but
as
this
involves
the
presence
of
an
atmosphere
the
idea
hardly
finds
favour
at
the
present
time
though
perhaps
the
possibility
of
plant
growth
in
the
districts
where
a
gaseous
medium
may
prevail
is
not
altogether
so
chimerical
a
notion
as
to
be
unworthy
of
consideration
nasmyth
and
others
suggest
that
these
tints
may
be
due
to
broad
expanses
of
coloured
volcanic
material
an
hypothesis
which
if
we
believe
the
maria
to
be
overspread
with
such
matter
and
knowing
how
it
varies
in
colour
in
terrestrial
volcanic
regions
is
more
probable
than
the
first
anyway
whether
we
consider
these
appearances
to
be
objective
or
after
all
only
due
to
purely
physiological
causes
they
undoubtedly
merit
closer
study
and
investigation
than
they
have
hitherto
received
there
are
of
these
dusky
areas
which
have
received
distinctive
names
seventeen
of
them
are
wholly
or
in
great
part
confined
to
the
northern
and
to
the
quarter
of
the
southern
hemisphere
the
quadrant
being
to
a
great
extent
devoid
of
them
by
far
the
largest
is
the
vast
oceanus
procellarum
extending
from
a
high
northern
latitude
to
beyond
latitude
deg
in
the
quadrant
and
according
to
schmidt
with
its
bays
and
inflections
occupying
an
area
of
nearly
two
million
square
miles
or
more
than
that
of
all
the
remaining
maria
put
together
next
in
order
of
size
come
the
mare
nubium
of
about
the
superficies
covering
a
large
portion
of
the
quadrant
and
extending
considerably
north
of
the
equator
and
the
mare
imbrium
wholly
confined
to
the
northeastern
quadrant
and
including
an
area
of
about
square
miles
these
are
by
far
the
largest
lunar
seas
the
mare
foecunditatis
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
greater
part
of
it
lying
in
the
western
quadrant
is
scarcely
half
so
big
as
the
mare
imbrium
while
the
maria
serenitatis
and
tranquilitatis
about
equal
in
area
the
former
situated
wholly
north
of
the
equator
and
the
latter
only
partially
extending
south
of
it
are
still
smaller
the
arctic
mare
frigoris
some
square
miles
in
extent
is
the
only
remaining
large
sea
the
rest
such
as
the
mare
vaporum
the
sinus
medii
the
mare
crisium
the
mare
humorum
and
the
mare
humboldtianum
are
of
comparatively
small
dimensions
the
mare
crisium
not
greatly
exceeding
square
miles
the
mare
humorum
about
the
size
of
england
square
miles
while
the
mare
humboldtianum
according
to
schmidt
includes
only
about
square
miles
an
area
which
is
approached
by
some
formations
not
classed
with
the
maria
this
distinction
speaking
generally
prevails
among
the
maria
those
of
larger
size
such
as
the
oceanus
procellarum
the
mare
nubium
and
the
mare
foecunditatis
are
less
definitely
enclosed
and
like
terrestrial
oceans
communicate
with
one
another
while
their
borders
or
if
the
term
may
be
allowed
their
is
often
comparatively
low
and
exhibiting
many
inlets
and
irregularities
in
outline
others
again
of
considerable
area
as
for
example
the
mare
serenitatis
and
the
mare
imbrium
are
bounded
more
or
less
completely
by
curved
borders
consisting
of
towering
mountain
ranges
descending
with
a
very
steep
escarpment
to
their
surface
thus
in
form
and
other
characteristics
they
resemble
immense
plains
among
the
best
examples
of
enclosed
maria
is
the
mare
crisium
which
is
considered
by
neison
to
be
the
deepest
of
all
and
the
mare
humboldtianum
though
these
great
plains
are
described
as
level
this
term
must
only
be
taken
in
a
comparative
sense
no
one
who
observes
them
when
their
surface
is
thrown
into
relief
by
the
oblique
rays
of
the
rising
or
setting
sun
can
fail
to
remark
many
low
swellings
with
gently
rounded
outlines
shallow
hollows
and
in
the
majority
of
them
long
sinuous
ridges
either
running
concentrically
with
their
borders
or
traversing
them
from
side
to
side
though
none
of
these
features
are
of
any
great
altitude
or
depth
some
of
the
ridges
are
as
much
as
feet
in
height
and
probably
in
many
instances
the
other
elevations
often
rise
to
feet
or
more
above
the
parts
of
the
plains
on
which
they
stand
hence
we
may
say
that
the
maria
are
only
level
in
the
sense
that
many
districts
in
the
english
midland
counties
are
level
and
not
that
their
surface
is
absolutely
flat
the
same
may
be
said
as
to
their
apparent
smoothness
which
as
is
evident
when
they
are
viewed
close
to
the
terminator
is
an
expression
needing
qualification
for
under
these
conditions
they
often
appear
to
be
covered
with
wrinkles
flexures
and
little
asperities
which
to
be
visible
at
all
must
be
of
considerable
size
in
fact
were
it
possible
to
examine
them
from
a
distance
of
a
few
miles
instead
of
from
a
standpoint
which
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
can
not
be
reckoned
at
less
than
and
this
through
an
interposed
aerial
medium
always
more
or
less
perturbed
they
would
probably
be
described
as
rugged
and
uneven
as
some
modern
lava
sheets
among
the
maria
which
exhibit
the
most
remarkable
arrangement
of
ridges
is
the
mare
humorum
in
the
quadrant
here
if
it
be
observed
under
a
rising
sun
a
number
of
these
objects
will
be
seen
extending
from
the
region
north
of
the
vitello
in
long
undulating
lines
roughly
concentric
with
the
western
border
of
the
sea
and
gradually
diminishing
in
altitude
as
they
spread
out
with
many
ramifications
to
a
distance
of
miles
or
more
towards
the
north
at
this
stage
of
illumination
they
are
strikingly
beautiful
in
a
good
telescope
reminding
one
of
the
left
by
the
tide
on
a
soft
sandy
beach
like
most
other
objects
of
their
class
they
are
very
evanescent
gradually
disappearing
as
the
sun
rises
higher
in
the
lunar
firmament
and
ultimately
leaving
nothing
to
indicate
their
presence
beyond
here
and
there
a
ghostly
streak
or
vein
of
a
somewhat
lighter
hue
than
that
of
the
neighbouring
surface
the
mare
nectaris
again
in
the
quadrant
presents
some
fine
examples
of
concentric
ridges
which
are
seen
to
the
best
advantage
when
the
morning
sun
is
rising
on
rosse
a
prominent
crater
north
of
fracastorius
this
sea
is
evidently
concave
in
the
central
portion
being
considerably
lower
than
the
margin
and
these
ridges
appear
to
mark
the
successive
stages
of
the
change
of
level
from
the
to
the
centre
they
suggest
the
caving
in
of
the
surface
similar
to
that
observed
on
a
frozen
pond
or
river
where
the
cat
ice
at
the
edge
through
the
sinking
of
the
water
beneath
is
rent
and
tilted
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
mare
serenitatis
and
the
mare
imbrium
in
the
northern
hemisphere
are
also
remarkable
for
the
number
of
these
peculiar
features
they
are
very
plentifully
distributed
round
the
margin
and
in
other
parts
of
the
former
which
includes
besides
one
of
the
longest
and
loftiest
on
the
moon
visible
surface
the
great
serpentine
ridge
first
drawn
and
described
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
by
the
famous
selenographer
schroter
of
lilienthal
originating
at
a
little
crater
under
the
east
wall
of
great
posidonius
it
follows
a
winding
course
across
the
mare
toward
the
south
throwing
out
many
minor
branches
and
ultimately
dies
out
under
a
great
rocky
promontory
the
promontory
acherusia
at
the
western
termination
of
the
haemus
range
a
comparatively
low
power
serves
to
show
the
curious
structural
character
of
this
immense
ridge
which
appears
to
consist
of
a
number
of
corrugations
and
folds
massed
together
rising
in
places
according
to
neison
to
a
height
of
feet
and
more
the
mare
imbrium
also
affords
an
example
of
a
ridge
which
though
shorter
is
nearly
as
prominent
in
that
which
runs
from
the
bright
little
piazzi
smyth
towards
the
west
side
of
plato
the
region
round
timocharis
and
other
quarters
of
the
mare
are
likewise
traversed
by
very
noteworthy
features
of
a
similar
class
the
oceanus
procellarum
also
presents
good
instances
of
ridges
in
the
marvellous
ramifications
round
encke
kepler
and
marius
and
in
the
region
north
of
aristarchus
and
herodotus
perhaps
the
most
perfect
examples
of
surface
swellings
are
those
in
the
mare
tranquilitatis
a
little
east
of
the
arago
where
there
are
two
nearly
equal
circular
mounds
at
least
ten
miles
in
diameter
resembling
tumuli
seen
from
above
similar
but
more
irregular
objects
of
a
like
kind
are
very
plentiful
in
many
other
quarters
it
is
a
suggestive
peculiarity
of
many
of
the
lunar
ridges
both
on
the
maria
and
elsewhere
that
they
are
very
generally
found
in
association
with
craters
of
every
size
illustrations
of
this
fact
occur
almost
everywhere
frequently
small
craters
are
found
on
the
summits
of
these
elevations
but
more
often
on
their
flanks
and
near
their
base
where
a
ridge
suddenly
changes
its
direction
a
crater
of
some
prominence
generally
marks
the
point
often
forming
a
node
or
of
other
ridges
which
thus
appear
to
radiate
from
it
as
a
centre
sometimes
they
intrude
within
the
smaller
passing
through
gaps
in
their
walls
as
for
example
in
the
cases
of
madler
lassell
various
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
to
account
for
them
the
late
professor
phillips
the
geologist
who
devoted
much
attention
to
the
telescopic
examination
of
the
physical
features
of
the
moon
compared
the
lunar
ridges
to
long
low
undulating
mounds
of
somewhat
doubtful
origin
called
kames
in
scotland
and
eskers
in
ireland
where
on
the
low
central
plain
they
are
commonly
found
in
the
form
of
extended
banks
mainly
of
gravel
with
more
or
less
steep
sides
rising
to
heights
of
from
to
feet
they
are
sometimes
only
a
few
yards
wide
at
the
top
while
in
other
places
they
spread
out
into
large
humps
having
circular
or
oval
cavities
on
their
summits
or
yards
across
and
as
much
as
feet
deep
like
the
lunar
ridges
they
throw
out
branches
and
exhibit
many
breaches
of
continuity
by
some
geologists
they
are
supposed
to
represent
old
submarine
banks
formed
by
tidal
currents
like
harbour
bars
and
by
others
to
be
glacial
deposits
in
either
case
to
be
either
directly
or
indirectly
due
to
alluvial
action
their
outward
resemblance
to
some
of
the
ridges
on
the
moon
is
unquestionable
and
if
we
could
believe
that
the
maria
as
we
now
see
them
are
it
might
be
concluded
that
these
ridges
had
a
similar
origin
but
their
close
connection
with
centres
of
volcanic
disturbance
and
the
numbers
of
little
craters
on
or
near
their
track
point
to
the
supposition
that
they
consist
rather
of
material
exuded
from
fissures
in
the
crust
of
the
seas
and
in
other
surfaces
where
they
are
superimposed
this
conjecture
is
rendered
still
more
probable
by
the
fact
that
we
sometimes
find
the
direction
of
clefts
which
are
undoubted
surface
cracks
prolonged
in
the
form
of
long
narrow
ridges
or
of
rows
of
little
hillocks
we
are
however
not
bound
to
assume
that
all
the
manifold
corrugations
observed
on
the
lunar
plains
are
due
to
one
and
the
same
cause
indeed
it
is
clear
that
some
are
merely
the
outward
indications
of
sudden
drops
in
the
surface
as
in
the
case
of
the
ridges
round
the
western
margin
of
the
mare
nectaris
and
in
other
situations
where
subsidence
is
manifested
by
features
assuming
the
outward
aspect
of
ordinary
ridges
but
which
are
in
reality
of
a
very
different
structural
character
the
maria
like
almost
every
other
part
of
the
visible
surface
abound
in
craters
of
a
minute
type
which
are
scattered
here
and
there
without
any
apparent
law
or
ascertained
principle
of
arrangement
seeing
how
imperfect
is
our
acquaintance
with
even
the
larger
objects
of
this
class
it
is
rash
to
insist
on
the
antiquity
or
permanence
of
such
diminutive
objects
or
to
dogmatise
about
the
cessation
of
lunar
activity
in
connection
with
features
where
the
volcanic
history
of
our
globe
if
it
is
of
any
value
as
an
analogue
teaches
us
it
is
most
likely
to
prevail
most
observers
will
agree
with
schmidt
that
observations
and
drawings
of
objects
on
the
sombre
depressed
plains
of
the
moon
are
easier
and
pleasanter
to
make
than
on
the
dazzling
highlands
and
that
the
lunar
sea
is
to
the
working
selenographer
like
an
oasis
in
the
desert
to
the
traveller
a
relief
in
this
case
however
not
to
an
exhausted
body
but
to
a
weary
eye
craters
it
is
these
objects
in
their
almost
endless
variety
and
bewildering
number
which
more
than
any
others
give
to
our
satellite
that
marvellous
appearance
in
the
telescope
which
since
the
days
of
galileo
has
never
failed
to
evoke
the
astonishment
of
the
beholder
however
familiar
we
may
be
with
the
lunar
surface
we
can
never
gaze
on
these
extraordinary
formations
whether
massed
together
apparently
in
inextricable
confusion
or
standing
in
isolated
grandeur
like
copernicus
on
the
grey
surface
of
the
plains
without
experiencing
in
a
scarcely
diminished
degree
the
same
sensation
of
wonder
and
admiration
with
which
they
were
beheld
for
the
first
time
although
the
attempt
to
bring
all
these
forms
under
a
rigid
scheme
of
classification
has
not
been
wholly
successful
their
structural
peculiarities
the
hypsometrical
relation
between
their
interior
and
the
surrounding
district
their
size
and
the
character
of
their
circumvallation
the
dimensions
of
their
cavernous
opening
as
compared
with
that
of
the
more
or
less
truncated
conical
mass
of
matter
surrounding
it
all
afford
a
basis
for
grouping
them
under
distinctive
titles
that
are
not
only
convenient
to
the
selenographer
but
which
undoubtedly
represent
as
a
rule
actual
diversities
in
their
origin
and
physical
character
these
distinguishing
titles
as
adopted
by
schroter
lohrmann
and
madler
and
accepted
by
subsequent
observers
are
mountain
rings
craters
craterlets
depressions
these
formations
approximating
more
or
less
to
the
circular
form
though
frequently
deviating
considerably
from
it
are
among
the
largest
enclosures
on
the
moon
they
vary
from
upwards
of
to
miles
or
under
in
diameter
and
are
often
encircled
by
a
complex
rampart
of
considerable
breadth
rising
in
some
instances
to
a
height
of
feet
or
more
above
the
enclosed
plain
this
rampart
is
rarely
continuous
but
is
generally
interrupted
by
gaps
crossed
by
transverse
valleys
and
passes
and
broken
by
more
recent
craters
and
depressions
as
a
rule
the
area
within
the
circumvallation
usually
termed
the
floor
is
only
slightly
if
at
all
lower
than
the
region
outside
it
is
very
generally
of
a
dusky
hue
similar
to
that
of
the
grey
plains
or
maria
and
like
them
is
usually
variegated
by
the
presence
of
hills
ridges
and
craters
and
is
sometimes
traversed
by
delicate
furrows
termed
clefts
or
rills
in
the
third
quadrant
and
not
far
removed
from
the
centre
of
the
disc
may
be
taken
as
a
typical
example
of
the
class
here
we
have
a
vast
plain
miles
from
side
to
side
encircled
by
a
massive
but
much
broken
wall
which
at
one
peak
towers
more
than
feet
above
a
level
floor
which
includes
details
of
a
very
remarkable
character
the
adjoining
is
another
but
somewhat
smaller
object
of
the
same
type
as
are
also
and
and
in
a
high
northern
latitude
with
its
noble
rampart
and
its
variable
interior
near
the
eastern
limb
perhaps
the
darkest
area
on
the
moon
nearly
as
big
on
the
eastern
limb
and
larger
than
either
still
farther
south
in
the
same
quadrant
although
they
approach
some
of
the
smaller
seas
in
size
are
placed
in
the
same
category
the
conspicuous
central
mountain
so
frequently
associated
with
other
types
of
ringed
enclosures
is
by
no
means
invariably
found
within
the
though
as
in
the
case
of
and
several
other
noteworthy
examples
it
is
very
prominently
displayed
the
progress
of
sunrise
on
all
these
objects
affords
a
magnificent
spectacle
very
often
when
the
rays
impinge
on
their
apparently
level
floor
at
an
angle
of
from
deg
to
it
is
seen
to
be
coarse
rough
grained
and
covered
with
minute
elevations
although
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
it
appears
as
smooth
as
glass
although
it
is
a
distinguishing
characteristic
that
there
is
no
great
difference
in
level
between
the
outside
and
the
inside
of
a
there
are
some
very
interesting
exceptions
to
this
rule
which
are
termed
by
schmidt
transitional
forms
among
these
he
places
some
of
the
most
colossal
formations
such
as
and
the
first
which
may
be
taken
as
representative
of
the
class
well
known
to
observers
as
one
of
the
grandest
of
lunar
objects
has
a
deeply
sunken
floor
fringed
with
mountains
rising
some
feet
above
it
though
they
scarcely
stand
a
fourth
of
this
height
above
the
plain
on
the
west
which
ascends
with
a
very
gentle
gradient
to
the
summit
of
the
wall
hence
the
contrast
between
the
shadows
of
the
peaks
of
the
western
wall
on
the
floor
at
sunrise
and
of
the
same
peaks
on
the
region
west
of
the
border
at
sunset
is
very
marked
in
and
we
have
similar
notable
departures
from
the
normal
type
the
floor
of
the
former
on
the
north
stands
feet
the
mare
humorum
in
probably
through
faulting
one
portion
of
the
interior
suddenly
sinks
to
a
considerable
depth
below
the
remainder
while
the
very
abnormal
has
such
an
elevated
floor
that
when
viewed
under
favourable
conditions
it
reminds
one
of
a
shallow
oval
tray
or
dish
filled
with
fluid
to
the
point
of
overflowing
these
examples
very
far
from
being
exhaustive
will
be
sufficient
to
show
that
the
exhibit
noteworthy
differences
in
other
respects
than
size
height
of
rampart
or
included
detail
still
another
peculiarity
confined
it
is
believed
to
a
very
few
may
be
mentioned
convexity
of
floor
prominently
displayed
in
petavius
mersenius
and
hevel
mountain
these
objects
usually
encircled
by
a
low
and
broken
border
seldom
more
than
a
few
hundred
feet
in
height
are
closely
allied
to
the
they
are
more
frequently
found
on
the
maria
than
elsewhere
in
some
cases
the
ring
consists
of
isolated
dark
sections
with
here
and
there
a
bright
mass
of
rock
interposed
in
others
of
low
curvilinear
ridges
forming
a
more
or
less
complete
circumvallation
they
vary
in
size
from
or
miles
to
miles
and
less
the
great
ring
north
of
flamsteed
miles
across
is
a
notable
example
another
lies
west
of
it
on
the
north
of
wichmann
while
a
third
will
be
found
east
of
encke
indeed
the
mare
procellarum
abounds
in
objects
of
this
type
the
curious
formation
on
the
mare
imbrium
immediately
south
of
plato
called
newton
by
schroter
may
be
placed
in
this
category
as
may
also
many
of
the
low
dusky
rings
of
much
smaller
dimensions
found
in
many
quarters
of
the
maria
as
has
been
stated
elsewhere
these
features
have
the
appearance
of
having
once
been
formations
of
a
much
more
prominent
and
important
character
which
have
suffered
destruction
more
or
less
complete
through
being
partially
overwhelmed
by
the
material
of
the
seas
these
are
by
far
the
most
numerous
of
the
ramparted
enclosures
of
the
moon
and
though
it
is
occasionally
difficult
to
decide
in
which
class
or
some
objects
should
be
placed
yet
as
a
rule
the
difference
between
the
structural
character
of
the
two
is
abundantly
obvious
the
vary
in
diameter
from
sixty
to
less
than
ten
miles
and
are
far
more
regular
in
outline
than
the
their
ramparts
often
very
massive
are
more
continuous
and
fall
with
a
steep
declivity
to
a
floor
almost
always
greatly
depressed
below
the
outside
region
the
inner
slopes
generally
display
subordinate
heights
called
terraces
arranged
more
or
less
concentrically
and
often
extending
in
successive
stages
nearly
down
to
the
interior
foot
of
the
wall
with
the
intervening
valleys
these
features
are
very
striking
objects
when
viewed
under
good
conditions
with
high
powers
in
some
cases
they
may
possibly
represent
the
effects
of
the
slipping
of
the
upper
portions
of
the
wall
from
a
want
of
cohesiveness
in
the
material
of
which
it
is
composed
but
this
hardly
explains
why
the
highest
terrace
often
stands
nearly
as
high
as
the
rampart
nasmyth
in
his
eruption
hypothesis
suggests
that
in
such
a
case
there
may
have
been
two
eruptions
from
the
same
vent
one
powerful
which
formed
the
exterior
circle
and
a
second
rather
less
powerful
which
has
formed
the
interior
circle
ultimately
however
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
terraces
as
a
rule
are
not
due
to
any
such
freaks
of
the
eruption
he
ascribes
them
to
landslips
in
any
case
we
can
hardly
imagine
that
material
standing
at
such
a
high
angle
of
inclination
as
that
forming
the
summit
ridge
of
many
of
the
would
not
frequently
slide
down
in
great
masses
and
thus
form
irregular
plateaus
on
the
lower
and
flatter
portions
of
the
slope
but
this
fails
to
explain
the
symmetrical
arrangement
of
the
concentric
terraces
and
intermediate
valleys
the
inner
declivity
of
the
wall
of
plato
exhibits
what
to
all
appearance
is
an
undoubted
landslip
as
does
also
that
of
hercules
on
the
northern
side
and
numerous
other
cases
might
be
adduced
but
in
all
of
them
the
appearance
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
true
terrace
the
or
outer
slope
of
a
is
invariably
of
a
much
gentler
inclination
than
that
which
characterises
the
inner
declivity
while
the
latter
very
frequently
descends
at
an
angle
varying
from
deg
to
deg
at
the
crest
of
the
wall
to
from
deg
to
deg
at
the
bottom
where
it
meets
the
floor
the
former
extends
for
a
great
distance
at
a
very
flat
gradient
before
it
sinks
to
the
general
level
of
the
surrounding
country
it
differs
likewise
from
the
inner
descent
in
the
fact
that
though
often
traversed
by
valleys
intersected
by
deep
gullies
and
irregular
depressions
and
covered
with
humpy
excrescences
and
craters
it
is
only
rarely
that
any
features
comparable
to
the
terraces
usually
present
on
the
inner
escarpment
can
be
traced
upon
it
elongated
depressions
of
irregular
outline
and
very
variable
in
size
and
depth
are
frequently
found
on
the
outer
slopes
of
the
border
some
of
them
consist
of
great
elliptical
or
cavities
displaying
many
expansions
and
contractions
called
pockets
and
suggesting
the
idea
that
they
were
originally
distinct
hollows
which
from
some
cause
or
other
have
coalesced
like
rows
of
inosculating
craters
while
many
of
these
features
are
so
deep
that
they
remain
visible
for
a
considerable
time
under
a
low
sun
others
though
perhaps
of
greater
extent
vanish
in
an
hour
or
so
as
in
the
case
of
the
the
ramparts
of
the
exhibit
gaps
and
are
broken
by
craters
and
depressions
but
to
a
much
less
extent
often
the
lofty
crest
surmounted
by
or
by
blunter
peaks
towering
in
some
cases
to
nearly
double
its
altitude
above
the
interior
is
perfectly
continuous
like
copernicus
or
only
interrupted
by
narrow
passes
it
is
a
suggestive
circumstance
that
gaps
other
than
valleys
are
almost
invariably
found
either
in
the
north
or
south
walls
or
in
both
and
seldom
in
other
positions
the
buttress
or
spur
is
a
feature
frequently
associated
with
the
plain
rampart
as
are
also
numbers
of
what
for
the
lack
of
a
better
name
must
be
termed
little
hillocks
which
generally
radiate
in
long
rows
from
the
outer
foot
of
the
slope
the
spurs
usually
abut
on
the
wall
and
either
spreading
out
like
the
sticks
of
a
fan
or
running
roughly
parallel
to
each
other
extend
for
long
distances
gradually
diminishing
in
height
and
width
till
they
die
out
on
the
surrounding
surface
they
have
been
compared
to
lava
streams
which
those
round
aristillus
aristoteles
and
on
the
flank
of
clavius
certainly
somewhat
resemble
though
in
the
two
former
instances
they
are
rather
comparable
to
immense
ridges
in
addition
to
the
above
the
spurs
radiating
from
the
rampart
of
condamine
and
the
long
undulating
ridges
and
rows
of
hillocks
running
from
cyrillus
over
the
eastern
of
theophilus
may
be
named
as
very
interesting
examples
neison
and
some
other
selenographers
place
in
a
distinct
class
certain
of
the
smaller
which
usually
have
a
steeper
outer
slope
and
are
supposed
to
present
clearer
indications
of
a
volcanic
origin
than
the
terming
them
under
this
generic
name
is
placed
a
vast
number
of
formations
exhibiting
a
great
difference
in
size
and
outward
characteristics
though
generally
under
moderate
magnification
of
a
circular
or
shape
their
diameter
varies
from
miles
or
more
to
and
even
less
and
their
flanks
rise
much
more
steeply
to
the
summit
which
is
seldom
very
lofty
than
those
of
the
and
fall
more
gradually
to
the
floor
there
is
no
portion
of
the
moon
in
which
they
do
not
abound
whether
it
be
on
the
ramparts
floors
and
outer
slopes
of
walled
and
ring
plains
the
summits
and
escarpments
of
mountain
ranges
amid
the
intricacies
of
the
highlands
or
on
the
grey
surface
of
the
maria
in
many
instances
they
have
a
brighter
and
newer
aspect
than
the
larger
formations
often
being
the
most
brilliant
points
on
their
walls
when
they
are
found
in
this
position
very
frequently
too
they
are
not
only
very
bright
themselves
but
stand
on
bright
areas
whose
borders
are
generally
concentric
with
them
which
shine
with
a
glistening
lustre
and
form
a
kind
of
halo
of
light
around
them
euclides
and
bessarion
a
and
the
craters
east
of
landsberg
are
especially
interesting
examples
it
seems
not
improbable
that
these
areas
may
represent
deposits
formed
by
some
kind
of
matter
ejected
from
the
craters
but
whether
of
ancient
or
modern
date
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
determine
future
observers
will
perhaps
be
in
a
better
position
to
decide
the
question
without
cavil
if
such
eruptions
should
again
take
place
like
the
larger
enclosures
these
smaller
objects
frequently
encroach
upon
each
other
overlapping
as
in
the
case
of
thebit
where
a
large
crater
which
has
interfered
with
the
continuity
of
the
east
wall
has
in
its
turn
been
disturbed
by
a
smaller
crater
on
its
own
east
wall
the
craters
in
many
cases
possibly
in
the
majority
if
we
could
detect
them
have
central
mountains
some
of
them
being
excellent
tests
for
telescopic
definition
as
for
example
the
central
peaks
of
hortensius
bessarion
and
that
of
the
small
crater
just
mentioned
on
the
east
wall
of
thebit
a
a
tendency
to
a
linear
arrangement
is
often
displayed
especially
among
the
smaller
class
as
is
also
their
occurrence
in
pairs
these
objects
plentifully
distributed
on
the
lunar
surface
are
especially
interesting
from
their
outward
resemblance
to
the
parasitic
cones
found
on
the
flanks
of
terrestrial
volcanoes
etna
for
instance
in
the
larger
examples
it
is
occasionally
possible
to
see
that
the
interiors
are
either
inverted
cones
without
a
floor
or
depressions
on
the
summit
of
the
object
frequently
however
they
are
so
small
that
the
orifice
can
only
be
detected
under
oblique
illumination
under
a
high
sun
they
generally
appear
as
white
spots
more
or
less
defined
as
on
the
floors
of
archimedes
fracastorius
plato
and
many
other
formations
which
include
a
great
number
all
of
which
are
probably
crater
cones
although
only
a
few
have
been
seen
as
such
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
in
these
situations
they
are
always
found
to
be
closely
associated
with
the
light
streaks
which
traverse
the
interior
of
the
formations
standing
either
on
their
surface
or
close
to
their
edges
the
instrumental
and
meteorological
requirements
necessary
for
a
successful
scrutiny
of
the
smallest
type
of
these
features
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
observer
in
this
country
as
they
demand
direct
observation
in
large
telescopes
under
the
best
atmospheric
conditions
some
years
ago
klein
of
cologne
called
attention
to
some
very
interesting
types
of
which
may
be
found
on
certain
dark
or
areas
on
the
moon
these
he
considers
may
probably
represent
active
volcanic
vents
and
urges
that
they
should
be
diligently
examined
and
watched
by
observers
who
possess
telescopes
adequate
to
the
task
the
most
noteworthy
examples
of
these
objects
are
in
the
following
positions
west
of
a
prominent
ridge
running
from
beaumont
to
the
west
side
of
theophilus
and
about
midway
between
these
formations
in
the
mare
vaporum
south
of
hyginus
on
the
floor
of
werner
near
the
foot
of
the
north
wall
under
the
east
wall
of
alphonsus
on
the
dusky
patch
in
the
interior
on
the
south
side
of
the
floor
of
atlas
i
have
frequently
described
elsewhere
with
considerable
detail
the
telescopic
appearance
of
these
features
under
various
phases
and
have
pointed
out
that
though
large
apertures
and
high
powers
are
needed
to
see
these
cones
to
advantage
the
dusky
areas
easily
traced
on
photograms
might
be
usefully
studied
by
observers
with
smaller
instruments
as
if
they
represent
the
from
the
which
stand
upon
them
changes
in
their
form
and
extent
could
very
possibly
be
detected
in
addition
to
those
already
referred
to
a
number
of
mysterious
dark
spots
were
discovered
by
schmidt
in
the
dusky
region
about
midway
between
copernicus
and
gambart
which
klein
describes
as
perforated
like
a
sieve
with
minute
craters
a
short
distance
of
copernicus
stands
a
bright
surrounded
by
a
grey
nimbus
which
may
be
classed
with
these
objects
it
is
well
seen
under
a
high
light
as
indeed
is
the
case
with
most
of
these
features
craterlets
to
a
great
extent
the
former
term
is
needless
and
misleading
as
the
craters
merge
by
imperceptible
gradations
into
very
minute
objects
as
small
as
half
a
mile
in
diameter
and
most
probably
if
we
could
more
accurately
estimate
their
size
still
less
the
however
has
peculiarities
which
distinguish
it
from
all
other
types
such
as
the
absence
of
a
distinguishable
rim
and
extreme
shallowness
they
appear
to
be
most
numerous
on
the
plains
and
plateaus
in
the
quadrant
and
may
be
counted
by
hundreds
under
good
atmospheric
conditions
on
the
outer
slopes
of
walter
clavius
and
other
large
enclosures
in
these
positions
they
are
often
so
closely
aggregated
that
as
nasmyth
remarks
they
remind
one
of
an
accumulation
of
froth
even
in
an
inch
reflector
i
have
frequently
seen
the
outer
slope
of
the
large
on
the
side
of
vendelinus
so
perforated
with
these
objects
that
it
resembled
pumice
or
vesicular
lava
many
of
the
little
holes
being
evidently
not
circular
but
square
shaped
and
very
irregular
the
interior
of
stadius
and
the
region
outside
abounds
in
these
minute
features
but
the
between
this
formation
and
copernicus
seems
rather
to
consist
of
a
number
of
inosculating
as
they
stand
very
evidently
on
a
raised
bank
of
some
altitude
mountain

isolated
mountains

more
massive

what
is
significant
in
that
portion
of
it
which
exhibits
few
indications
of
other
superficial
disturbances
the
most
prominently
developed
systems
the

the

it
all

appearance
of

the
former
include
many
hundred
peaks
among

blanc
rises
to
a
height
of
feet
and
a
second
some
distance
west
of
plato
to
nearly
as
great
an
altitude
while
others
ranging
from
to
feet
are
common
they
extend
in
a
direction
from
plato
to
the
caucasus
terminating
somewhat
abruptly
a
little
west
of
the
central
meridian
in
about
lat

one
of
the
most
interesting
features
associated
with
this
range
is
the
great

cuts
through

of

of

they
flank

of

rills
first
detected
by
the
hanoverian

on

discovered

very
curious

the

classed
with

it
is
an
object
of
a
very
different
kind

and

found
ten
rills

twenty
years
elapsed
before
an
addition
was
made
to
this

by

discoveries
of
gruithuisen

a
short
time
after
by
those
of
lohrmann
who
in
twelve

detected

finally
schmidt

the
significance
of
the
word
in

a
groove
or
furrow
describes
with
considerable
accuracy
the
usual
appearance
of
the
objects
to
which
it
is
applied
consisting
as
they
do
of
long
narrow
channels
with
sides
more
or
less
steep
and
sometimes
vertical
they
often
extend
for
hundreds
of
miles
in
approximately
straight
lines
over
portions
of
the
moon
surface
frequently
traversing
in
their
course
ridges
craters
and
even
more
formidable
obstacles
without
any
apparent
check
or
interruption
though
their
ends
are
sometimes
marked
by
a
mound
or
crater
their
length
ranges
from
ten
or
twelve
to
three
hundred
miles
or
more
as
in
the
great
sirsalis
rill
their
breadth
which
is
very
variable
within
certain
limits
from
less
than
half
a
mile
to
more
than
two
and
their
depth
which
must
necessarily
remain
to
a
great
extent
problematical
from
to
yards
they
exhibit
in
the
telescope
a
gradation
from
somewhat
coarse
grooves
easily
visible
at
suitable
times
in
very
moderately
sized
instruments
to
striae
so
delicate
as
to
require
the
largest
and
most
perfect
optical
means
and
the
best
atmospheric
conditions
to
be
glimpsed
at
all
viewed
under
moderate
amplification
the
majority
of
rills
resemble
deep
channels
with
roughly
parallel
sides
displaying
occasionally
local
irregularities
and
fining
off
to
invisibility
at
one
or
both
ends
but
if
critically
scrutinised
in
the
best
observing
weather
with
high
powers
the
apparent
evenness
of
their
edges
entirely
disappears
and
we
find
that
the
latter
exhibit
indentations
projections
and
little
flexures
like
the
banks
of
an
ordinary
stream
or
rivulet
or
to
use
a
very
homely
simile
the
serrated
edges
and
little
jagged
irregularities
of
a
biscuit
broken
across
in
some
cases
we
remark
crateriform
hollows
or
sudden
expansions
in
their
course
and
deep
sinuous
ravines
which
render
them
still
more
unsymmetrical
and
variable
in
breadth
with
regard
to
their
distribution
on
the
lunar
surface
they
are
found
in
almost
every
region
but
perhaps
not
so
frequently
on
the
surface
of
the
maria
as
elsewhere
though
as
in
the
case
of
the
triesnecker
and
other
systems
they
often
abound
in
the
neighbourhood
of
disturbed
regions
in
these
plains
and
in
many
cases
along
their
margins
as
for
example
the
and
the
groups
the
interior
of
walled
plains
are
frequently
intersected
by
them
as
in
gassendi
where
nearly
forty
more
or
less
delicate
examples
have
been
seen
in
hevel
where
there
is
a
very
interesting
system
of
crossed
clefts
and
within
posidonius
if
we
study
any
good
modern
lunar
map
it
is
evident
how
constantly
they
appear
near
the
borders
of
mountain
ranges
and
as
for
instance
at
the
foot
of
the
apennines
near
archimedes
aristarchus
ramsden
and
in
many
other
similar
positions
rugged
highlands
also
are
often
traversed
by
them
as
in
the
case
of
those
lying
west
of
le
monnier
and
chacornac
and
in
the
region
west
of
the
mare
humorum
it
may
be
here
remarked
however
as
a
notable
fact
that
the
neighbourhood
of
the
grandest
on
the
moon
copernicus
is
strange
to
say
devoid
of
any
features
which
can
be
classed
as
true
clefts
though
it
abounds
in
the
intricate
network
of
rills
on
the
west
of
triesnecker
when
observed
with
a
low
power
reminds
one
of
the
wrinkles
on
the
rind
of
an
orange
or
on
the
skin
of
a
withered
apple
gruithuisen
describing
the
region
between
agrippa
and
hyginus
says
that
it
has
quite
the
look
of
a
dutch
canal
map
in
the
subjoined
catalogue
many
detailed
examples
will
be
given
relating
to
the
course
of
these
mysterious
furrows
how
they
occasionally
traverse
mountain
arms
cut
through
either
completely
or
partially
as
in
ramsden
the
borders
of
and
other
enclosures
while
not
unfrequently
a
small
mound
or
similar
feature
appears
to
have
caused
them
to
swerve
suddenly
from
their
path
as
in
the
case
of
the
ariadaeus
cleft
and
in
that
of
one
member
of
the
system
of
the
actual
nature
of
the
lunar
rills
we
are
it
must
be
confessed
supremely
ignorant
with
some
of
the
early
observers
it
was
a
very
favourite
notion
that
they
are
artificial
works
constructed
presumably
by
kepler
or
by
other
intelligences
there
is
perhaps
some
excuse
to
be
made
for
the
freaks
of
an
exuberant
fancy
in
regard
to
objects
which
if
we
ignore
for
a
moment
their
enormous
dimensions
judged
by
a
terrestrial
standard
certainly
have
in
their
apparent
absence
of
any
physical
relation
to
neighbouring
objects
all
the
appearance
of
being
works
of
art
rather
than
of
nature
the
and
very
imaginative
gruithuisen
believed
that
in
some
instances
they
represent
roads
cut
through
interminable
forests
and
in
others
the
beds
of
once
mighty
rivers
his
description
of
the
triesnecker
reads
like
a
page
from
a
geographical
primer
a
portion
of
it
is
compared
to
the
river
po
and
he
traces
its
course
mile
by
mile
up
to
the
delta
at
its
place
of
disemboguement
into
the
mare
vaporum
from
the
position
of
some
rills
with
respect
to
the
contour
of
the
surrounding
country
it
is
evident
that
if
water
were
now
present
on
the
moon
they
being
situated
at
the
lowest
level
would
form
natural
channels
for
its
reception
but
the
exceptions
to
this
arrangement
are
so
numerous
and
obvious
that
the
idea
may
be
at
once
dismissed
that
there
is
any
analogy
between
them
and
our
rivers
the
eminent
selenographer
the
late
birt
compared
many
of
them
to
inverted
from
the
fact
that
as
often
as
not
they
become
broader
and
deeper
as
they
attain
a
higher
level
the
branches
resemble
rivers
more
frequently
than
the
main
channels
for
they
generally
commence
as
very
fine
grooves
and
becoming
broader
and
broader
join
them
at
an
acute
angle
an
attempt
again
has
been
made
to
compare
the
lunar
clefts
with
those
vast
gorges
the
marvellous
results
of
aqueous
action
called
canyons
which
attain
their
greatest
dimensions
in
north
america
such
as
the
great
canyon
of
the
colorado
which
is
at
least
miles
in
length
and
in
places
yards
in
depth
with
perpendicular
or
even
overhanging
sides
but
the
analogy
at
first
sight
specious
utterly
breaks
down
under
closer
examination
some
selenographers
consider
them
to
consist
of
rows
of
confluent
craters
too
minute
to
be
separately
distinguished
and
to
be
thus
due
to
some
kind
of
volcanic
action
this
is
undoubtedly
true
in
many
instances
for
almost
every
lunar
region
affords
examples
of
rows
merging
by
almost
imperceptible
gradations
into
features
and
of
considerable
size
resemble
clefts
under
low
powers
still
it
seems
probable
that
the
greater
number
of
these
features
are
immense
furrows
or
cracks
in
the
surface
and
nothing
more
for
the
higher
the
magnifying
power
employed
in
their
examination
the
less
reason
there
is
to
object
to
this
description
klein
of
cologne
believes
that
rills
of
this
class
are
due
to
the
shrinkage
of
parts
of
the
crust
and
that
they
are
not
as
a
rule
the
result
of
volcanic
causes
though
he
admits
that
there
may
be
some
which
have
a
seismic
origin
no
good
reason
has
as
yet
been
given
for
the
fact
that
they
so
frequently
cross
small
craters
and
other
objects
in
their
course
though
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
route
followed
by
a
rill
from
crater
to
crater
in
these
instances
may
be
a
line
of
least
surface
resistance
an
explanation
far
from
being
satisfactory
whether
variations
in
the
visibility
of
lunar
details
when
observed
under
apparently
similar
conditions
actually
occur
from
time
to
time
from
some
unknown
cause
is
one
of
those
vexed
questions
which
will
only
be
determined
when
the
moon
is
systematically
studied
by
experienced
observers
using
the
finest
instruments
at
exceptionally
good
stations
but
no
one
who
examines
existing
records
of
observations
of
rills
by
gruithuisen
lohrmann
madler
schmidt
and
other
observers
can
well
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
anomalies
brought
to
light
therein
point
strongly
to
the
probability
of
the
existence
of
some
agency
which
occasionally
modifies
their
appearance
or
entirely
conceals
them
from
view
the
following
is
one
illustration
out
of
many
which
might
be
quoted
at
a
point
in
its
course
nearly
due
north
of
the
agrippa
the
great
ariadaeus
cleft
sends
out
a
branch
which
runs
into
the
hyginus
cleft
reminding
one
as
klein
remarks
of
two
rivers
connected
in
the
shortest
way
by
a
canal
this
uniting
furrow
was
detected
by
gruithuisen
who
observed
it
several
times
on
some
occasions
it
appeared
perfectly
straight
at
others
very
irregular
but
what
is
very
remarkable
although
two
such
accurate
observers
as
lohrmann
and
madler
frequently
scrutinised
the
region
neither
of
them
saw
a
trace
of
this
object
and
but
for
its
rediscovery
by
schmidt
in
its
existence
would
certainly
have
been
ignored
by
selenographers
as
a
mere
figment
of
gruithuisen
too
lively
imagination
klein
has
frequently
seen
this
rill
with
great
distinctness
and
at
other
times
sought
for
it
in
vain
though
on
each
occasion
the
conditions
of
illumination
libration
and
definition
were
practically
similar
i
have
sometimes
found
this
cleft
an
easy
object
with
a
inch
achromatic
again
many
rills
described
by
madler
as
very
delicate
and
difficult
to
trace
may
now
be
easily
followed
in
common
telescopes
in
short
the
more
direct
telescopic
observations
accumulate
and
the
more
the
study
of
minute
detail
is
extended
the
stronger
becomes
the
conviction
that
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
an
appreciable
atmosphere
there
may
be
something
resembling
exhalations
from
some
parts
of
the
surface
which
from
time
to
time
are
sufficiently
dense
to
obscure
or
even
obliterate
the
region
beneath
them
if
as
seems
most
probable
these
gigantic
cracks
are
due
to
contractions
of
the
moon
surface
it
is
not
impossible
in
spite
of
the
assertions
of
the
to
the
effect
that
our
satellite
is
now
a
changeless
world
that
emanations
may
proceed
from
these
fissures
even
if
under
the
monthly
alternations
of
extreme
temperatures
surface
changes
do
not
now
occasionally
take
place
from
this
cause
also
should
this
be
so
the
appearance
of
new
rills
and
the
extension
and
modification
of
those
already
existing
may
reasonably
be
looked
for
many
instances
might
be
adduced
tending
to
confirm
this
supposition
to
one
of
which
as
coming
under
my
notice
i
will
briefly
refer
on
the
evening
of
november
when
examining
the
interior
of
the
great
mersenius
with
a
power
of
on
an
inch
reflector
in
addition
to
the
two
closely
parallel
clefts
discovered
by
schmidt
running
from
the
inner
foot
of
the
rampart
towards
the
centre
i
remarked
another
distinct
cleft
crossing
the
northern
part
of
the
floor
from
side
to
side
shortly
afterwards
gaudibert
one
of
our
most
experienced
selenographers
who
has
discovered
many
hitherto
unrecorded
clefts
having
seen
my
drawing
searched
for
this
object
and
though
the
night
was
far
from
favourable
had
distinct
though
brief
glimpses
of
it
with
the
moderate
magnifying
power
of
mersenius
is
a
formation
about
miles
in
diameter
with
a
prominently
convex
interior
containing
much
detail
which
has
received
more
than
ordinary
attention
from
observers
it
has
moreover
been
specially
mapped
by
schmidt
and
others
yet
no
trace
of
this
rill
was
noted
though
objects
much
more
minute
and
difficult
have
not
been
overlooked
does
not
an
instance
of
this
kind
raise
a
suspicion
of
recent
change
which
it
is
difficult
to
explain
away
to
see
the
lunar
clefts
to
the
best
advantage
they
must
be
looked
for
when
not
very
far
removed
from
the
terminator
as
when
so
situated
the
black
shadow
of
one
side
contrasted
with
the
usually
illuminated
opposite
flank
renders
them
more
conspicuous
than
when
they
are
viewed
under
a
higher
sun
though
as
a
rule
invisible
at
full
moon
some
of
the
coarser
clefts
as
for
example
a
portion
of
the
hyginus
furrow
and
that
north
of
birt
may
be
traced
as
delicate
white
lines
under
a
nearly
vertical
light
for
properly
observing
these
objects
a
power
of
not
less
than
on
telescopes
of
large
aperture
is
needed
and
in
studying
their
minute
and
delicate
details
we
are
perhaps
more
dependent
on
atmospheric
conditions
than
in
following
up
any
other
branch
of
observational
astronomy
few
indeed
are
the
nights
in
our
climate
at
any
rate
when
the
rough
irregular
character
of
the
steep
interior
of
even
the
coarser
examples
of
these
immense
chasms
can
be
steadily
seen
we
can
only
hope
to
obtain
a
more
perfect
insight
into
their
actual
structural
peculiarities
when
they
are
scrutinised
under
more
perfect
climatic
circumstances
than
they
have
been
hitherto
when
observing
the
hyginus
cleft
klein
noticed
that
at
one
place
the
declivities
of
the
interior
displayed
decided
differences
of
tint
at
many
points
the
reflected
sunlight
was
of
a
distinctly
yellow
hue
while
in
other
places
it
was
white
as
if
the
cliffs
were
covered
with
snow
he
compares
this
portion
of
the
rill
to
the
rhine
valley
between
bingen
and
coblentz
but
adds
that
the
latter
if
viewed
from
the
moon
would
probably
not
present
so
fresh
an
appearance
and
would
of
course
be
frequently
obscured
by
clouds
since
the
erection
of
the
great
lick
telescope
on
mount
hamilton
our
knowledge
of
the
details
of
some
of
the
lunar
clefts
has
been
greatly
increased
as
in
the
case
of
the
ariadaeus
cleft
and
many
others
professor
pickering
also
at
arequipa
has
made
at
that
ideal
astronomical
site
many
observations
which
when
published
will
throw
more
light
upon
their
peculiar
characteristics
a
few
years
ago
trouvelot
of
meudon
drew
attention
to
a
curious
appearance
which
he
noted
in
connection
with
certain
rills
when
near
the
terminator
extremely
attenuated
threads
of
light
on
their
sites
and
their
apparent
prolongations
he
observed
it
in
the
eudoxus
crossing
the
southern
side
of
the
floor
from
wall
to
wall
and
also
in
connection
with
the
prominent
cleft
running
from
the
north
side
of
burg
to
the
west
of
alexander
and
in
some
other
situations
he
terms
these
phenomena
apparent
prolongations
of
clefts
in
the
form
of
rows
of
hillocks
or
small
mounds
are
very
common
these
sudden
drops
in
the
surface
representing
local
dislocations
are
far
from
unusual
the
best
examples
being
the
straight
wall
or
railroad
west
of
birt
that
which
strikes
obliquely
across
plato
another
which
traverses
phocylides
and
a
fourth
that
has
manifestly
modified
the
mountain
arm
north
of
cichus
they
differ
from
the
terrestrial
phenomena
so
designated
in
the
fact
that
the
surface
indications
of
these
are
destroyed
by
denudation
or
masked
by
deposits
of
subsequent
date
in
many
cases
on
the
moon
though
its
course
can
not
be
traced
in
its
entirety
by
its
shadow
yet
the
existence
of
a
fault
may
be
inferred
by
the
displacement
and
fracture
of
neighbouring
objects
features
thus
designated
differing
greatly
both
in
size
and
character
are
met
with
in
almost
every
part
of
the
surface
except
on
the
grey
plains
while
the
smallest
examples
from
their
delicacy
tenuity
and
superficial
resemblance
to
rills
are
termed
the
larger
and
more
conspicuous
assume
the
appearance
of
coarse
chasms
gorges
or
depressions
between
these
two
extremes
are
many
objects
of
moderate
dimensions
winding
or
straight
ravines
and
defiles
bounded
by
steep
mountains
and
shallow
dales
flanked
by
low
rounded
heights
the
rill
valleys
are
very
numerous
only
differing
in
many
instances
from
the
true
rills
in
size
and
are
probably
due
to
the
same
cause
among
the
most
noteworthy
valleys
of
the
largest
class
must
of
course
be
placed
the
great
valley
of
the
alps
one
of
the
most
striking
objects
in
the
northern
hemisphere
which
also
includes
the
great
valley
of
ukert
the
rheita
valley
the
very
similar
chasm
west
of
reichenbach
and
the
gorge
west
of
herschel
are
also
notable
examples
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
borders
of
some
of
the
maria
especially
that
of
the
mare
crisium
and
of
many
of
the
depressed
rimless
formations
furnish
instances
of
winding
valleys
intersecting
their
borders
the
hilly
regions
likewise
often
abound
in
long
branching
defiles
bright
reference
has
already
been
made
to
the
faint
light
streaks
and
markings
often
found
on
the
floors
of
the
and
in
other
situations
and
to
the
brilliant
surrounding
some
of
the
smaller
craters
but
in
addition
to
these
many
objects
on
the
visible
surface
are
associated
with
a
much
more
remarkable
and
conspicuous
phenomenon
the
bright
rays
which
under
a
high
sun
are
seen
either
to
radiate
from
them
as
apparent
centres
to
great
distances
or
in
the
form
of
irregular
light
areas
to
environ
them
and
to
throw
out
lucid
beams
extending
occasionally
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
their
origin
the
more
striking
of
these
systems
were
recognised
and
drawn
at
a
very
early
stage
of
telescopic
observation
as
may
be
seen
if
we
consult
the
quaint
old
charts
of
hevel
riccioli
fontana
and
other
observers
of
the
seventeenth
century
where
they
are
always
prominently
though
very
inaccurately
portrayed
the
principal
are
those
of
tycho
copernicus
kepler
anaxagoras
aristarchus
olbers
byrgius
a
and
zuchius
while
autolycus
aristillus
proclus
timocharis
furnerius
a
and
menelaus
are
grouped
as
constituting
minor
systems
many
additional
centres
exist
a
list
of
which
will
be
found
in
the
appendix
the
rays
emanating
from
tycho
surpass
in
extent
and
interest
any
of
the
others
hundreds
of
distinct
light
streaks
originate
round
the
grey
margin
of
this
magnificent
object
some
of
them
extending
over
a
greater
part
of
the
moon
visible
superficies
and
radiating
in
the
words
of
professor
phillips
like
false
meridians
or
like
meridians
true
to
an
earlier
pole
of
rotation
no
systematic
attempt
has
yet
been
made
to
map
them
accurately
as
a
whole
on
a
large
scale
for
their
extreme
intricacy
and
delicacy
would
render
the
task
a
very
difficult
one
and
moreover
would
demand
a
long
course
of
observation
with
a
powerful
telescope
in
an
ideal
situation
but
professor
pickering
observing
under
these
conditions
at
arequipa
has
recently
devoted
considerable
attention
both
to
the
tycho
and
other
rays
with
especially
suggestive
and
important
results
which
may
be
briefly
summarised
as
follows
that
the
tycho
streaks
do
not
radiate
from
the
apparent
centre
of
this
formation
but
point
towards
a
multitude
of
minute
craterlets
on
its
or
northern
rims
similar
craterlets
occur
on
the
rims
of
other
great
craters
forming
speaking
generally
a
very
minute
and
brilliant
crater
is
located
at
the
end
of
the
streak
nearest
the
radiant
point
the
streak
spreading
out
and
becoming
fainter
towards
the
other
end
the
majority
of
the
streaks
appear
to
issue
from
one
or
more
of
these
minute
craters
which
rarely
exceed
a
mile
in
diameter
the
streaks
which
do
not
issue
from
minute
craters
usually
lie
upon
or
across
ridges
or
in
other
similar
exposed
situations
sometimes
apparently
coming
through
notches
in
the
mountain
walls
many
of
the
copernicus
streaks
start
from
craterlets
within
the
rim
flow
up
the
inside
and
down
the
outside
of
the
walls
kepler
includes
two
such
craterlets
but
here
the
flow
seems
to
have
been
more
uniform
over
the
edges
of
the
whole
crater
and
is
not
distinctly
divided
up
into
separate
streams
though
there
are
similar
craters
within
tycho
the
streaks
from
them
do
not
extend
far
beyond
the
walls
all
the
conspicuous
tycho
streaks
originate
outside
the
rim
the
streaks
of
copernicus
kepler
and
aristarchus
are
greyish
in
colour
and
much
less
white
than
those
associated
with
tycho
some
white
lines
extending
from
aristarchus
do
not
apparently
belong
to
the
system
in
the
case
of
craterlets
lying
between
aristarchus
and
copernicus
the
streaks
point
away
from
the
latter
there
are
no
very
long
streaks
they
vary
from
ten
to
fifty
miles
in
length
and
are
rarely
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
broad
at
the
crater
from
this
point
they
gradually
widen
out
and
become
fainter
their
width
however
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
crater
seldom
exceeds
five
miles
these
statements
especially
those
relating
to
the
length
of
the
streaks
are
utterly
opposed
to
prevailing
notions
but
professor
pickering
specifies
the
case
of
the
two
familiar
parallel
rays
extending
from
the
of
tycho
to
the
region
east
of
bullialdus
his
observations
show
that
these
streaks
originating
at
a
number
of
little
craters
situated
from
thirty
to
sixty
miles
beyond
the
confines
of
tycho
enter
a
couple
of
broad
slightly
depressed
valleys
in
these
valleys
are
found
numerous
minute
craters
of
the
kind
above
described
with
intensely
brilliant
interiors
when
the
streaks
issuing
from
those
craters
near
tycho
are
nearly
exhausted
they
are
reinforced
by
streaks
from
other
craters
which
they
encounter
upon
the
way
the
streaks
becoming
more
pronounced
at
these
points
these
streaks
are
again
reinforced
farther
out
these
parallel
rays
must
therefore
not
be
considered
as
two
streaks
but
as
two
series
of
streaks
the
components
of
which
are
placed
end
to
end
thus
according
to
professor
pickering
we
must
no
longer
regard
the
rays
emanating
from
the
tycho
region
and
other
centres
as
continuous
but
as
consisting
of
a
succession
of
short
lengths
diminishing
in
brilliancy
but
increasing
in
width
till
they
reach
the
next
crater
lying
in
their
direction
when
they
are
reinforced
and
the
same
process
of
gradual
diminution
in
brightness
and
reinforcement
goes
on
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
following
explanation
is
suggested
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
rays
the
earth
and
her
satellite
may
differ
not
so
much
as
regards
volcanic
action
as
in
the
densities
of
their
atmospheres
thus
if
the
craterlets
on
the
rim
of
tycho
were
constantly
giving
out
large
quantities
of
gas
or
steam
which
in
other
regions
was
being
constantly
absorbed
or
condensed
we
should
have
a
wind
uniformly
blowing
away
from
that
summit
in
all
directions
should
other
summits
in
its
vicinity
occasionally
give
out
gases
mixed
with
any
fine
white
powder
such
as
pumice
this
powder
would
be
carried
away
from
tycho
forming
streaks
the
difficulty
surrounding
this
very
ingenious
hypothesis
is
that
though
assuming
the
existence
of
craters
and
regions
of
condensation
there
might
be
a
more
or
less
lineal
and
streaky
deposition
of
this
white
material
over
large
areas
of
the
moon
why
should
this
deposit
be
so
definitely
arranged
and
why
should
these
active
little
craters
happen
to
lie
on
these
particular
lines
the
confused
network
of
streaks
round
copernicus
seem
to
respond
more
happily
to
the
requirements
of
professor
pickering
hypothesis
for
here
there
is
an
absence
of
that
definiteness
of
direction
so
manifestly
displayed
in
the
case
of
the
tycho
rays
and
we
can
well
imagine
that
with
an
area
of
condensation
surrounding
this
magnificent
object
beyond
the
limits
of
the
streaks
and
a
number
of
active
little
craters
on
and
about
its
rim
the
white
material
ejected
might
be
drawn
outwards
in
every
direction
by
wind
currents
which
possibly
once
existed
and
settling
down
assume
forms
such
as
we
see
nasmyth
hypothesis
attributes
the
radiating
streaks
to
cracks
in
the
lunar
globe
caused
by
the
action
of
an
upheaving
force
and
accounts
for
their
whiteness
by
the
outwelling
of
lava
from
them
which
has
spread
to
a
greater
or
less
distance
on
either
side
if
the
moon
has
been
fractured
in
this
way
we
can
easily
suppose
that
the
craters
formed
on
these
fissures
being
in
communication
with
the
interior
might
eject
some
pulverulent
white
matter
long
after
the
rest
of
the
surface
with
its
other
types
of
craters
had
attained
a
quiescent
stage
the
tycho
rays
when
viewed
under
ordinary
conditions
appear
to
extend
in
unbroken
bands
to
immense
distances
one
of
the
most
remarkable
strikes
along
the
eastern
side
of
fracastorius
across
the
mare
nectaris
to
guttemberg
while
another
more
central
extends
with
local
variations
in
brightness
through
menelaus
over
the
mare
serenitatis
nearly
to
the
limb
this
is
the
ray
that
figures
so
prominently
in
rude
woodcuts
of
the
moon
in
which
the
mare
serenitatis
traversed
by
it
is
made
to
resemble
the
greek
letter
phi
the
kepler
aristarchus
and
copernicus
systems
though
of
much
smaller
extent
are
very
noteworthy
from
the
crossing
and
apparent
interference
of
the
rays
while
those
near
byrgius
round
aristarchus
and
the
rays
from
proclus
are
equally
remarkable
nichol
found
that
the
rays
from
kepler
cut
through
rays
from
copernicus
and
aristarchus
while
rays
from
the
latter
cut
through
rays
from
the
former
he
therefore
inferred
that
their
relative
ages
stand
in
the
order
copernicus
aristarchus
kepler
as
no
branch
of
selenography
has
been
more
neglected
than
the
observation
of
these
interesting
but
enigmatical
features
one
may
hope
that
in
spite
of
the
exacting
conditions
as
to
situation
and
instrumental
requirements
necessary
for
their
successful
scrutiny
the
fairly
equipped
amateur
in
this
less
favoured
country
will
not
be
deterred
from
attempting
to
clear
up
some
of
the
doubts
and
difficulties
which
at
present
exist
as
to
their
actual
nature
the
moon
albedo
surface
brightness
sir
john
herschel
maintained
that
the
actual
illumination
of
the
lunar
surface
is
not
much
superior
to
that
of
weathered
sandstone
rock
in
full
sunshine
i
have
he
says
frequently
compared
the
moon
setting
behind
the
grey
perpendicular
facade

some

was
made
to
a
satisfactory
determination

temperature
of
the

from

he
inferred
that

about
three

subsequent

render
these

more
than
doubtful
without
it
is
admitted
that
the

make
it
probable
that
the

the

in
different

of
the

under
various
solar
altitudes
lunar
in
observing
the
moon
we
enjoy
an
advantage
of
which
we
can
not
boast
when
most
other
planetary
bodies
are
scrutinised
for
we
see
the
actual
surface
of
another
world
undimmed
by
palpable
clouds
or
exhalations
except
such
as
exist
in
the
air
above
us
and
can
gaze
on
the
marvellous
variety
of
objects
it
presents
much
as
we
contemplate
a
relief
map
of
our
own
globe
but
inasmuch
as
the
manifold
details
of
the
relief
map
require
to
be
placed
in
a
certain
light
to
be
seen
to
the
best
advantage
so
the
rugged
highlands
and
plains
of
our
satellite
as
they
pass
in
review
under
the
sun
must
be
observed
when
suitable
conditions
of
illumination
prevail
if
we
wish
to
appreciate
their
true
character
and
significance
as
a
general
rule
lunar
objects
are
best
seen
when
they
are
at
no
great
distance
from
the
terminator
or
the
line
dividing
the
illumined
from
the
unillumined
portion
of
the
spherical
surface
this
line
is
constantly
changing
its
position
with
the
sun
advancing
slowly
onwards
towards
the
east
at
a
rate
which
roughly
speaking
amounts
to
about
min
in
an
hour
or
passing
over
deg
of
lunar
longitude
in
about
hrs
mins
when
an
object
is
situated
on
this
line
the
sun
is
either
rising
or
setting
on
the
neighbouring
region
and
every
inequality
of
the
surface
is
rendered
prominent
by
its
shadow
so
that
trifling
variations
in
level
and
minor
asperities
assume
for
the
time
being
an
importance
to
which
they
have
no
claim
if
we
are
observing
an
object
at
lunar
sunrise
a
very
short
time
often
only
a
few
minutes
elapses
before
the
confusion
caused
by
the
presence
of
the
shadows
of
these
generally
unimportant
features
ceases
to
interfere
with
the
observation
and
we
can
distinguish
between
those
details
which
are
really
noteworthy
and
others
which
are
trivial
and
evanescent
every
formation
we
are
studying
should
be
observed
and
drawn
if
possible
under
many
different
conditions
of
illumination
it
ought
in
fact
to
be
examined
from
the
time
when
its
loftiest
heights
are
first
illumined
by
the
rising
sun
till
they
disappear
at
sunset
this
is
of
course
practically
impossible
in
the
course
of
one
lunation
but
by
utilising
available
opportunities
a
number
of
observations
may
be
obtained
under
various
phases
which
will
be
more
or
less
exhaustive
it
can
not
be
said
that
much
is
known
about
any
object
until
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
carry
out
this
plan
features
which
assume
a
certain
appearance
at
one
phase
frequently
turn
out
to
be
altogether
different
when
viewed
under
another
important
details
obscured
by
shadows
craters
masked
by
those
of
neighbouring
objects
or
by
the
shadows
of
their
own
rims
are
often
only
revealed
when
the
sun
has
attained
an
altitude
of
ten
degrees
or
more
in
short
there
is
scarcely
a
formation
on
the
moon
which
does
not
exemplify
the
necessity
of
noting
its
aspect
from
sunrise
to
sunset
regard
must
also
be
had
to
libration
which
affects
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
every
object
carrying
out
of
the
range
of
observation
regions
near
the
limb
at
one
time
and
at
another
bringing
into
view
others
beyond
the
limits
of
the
maps
which
represent
the
moon
in
the
mean
state
of
libration
the
area
in
fact
thus
brought
into
view
or
taken
out
of
it
is
between
and
of
the
entire
area
of
the
moon
or
about
the
part
of
the
hemisphere
turned
away
from
the
earth
it
is
convenient
to
bear
in
mind
that
we
see
an
object
under
nearly
the
same
conditions
every
or
still
more
accurately
after
the
lapse
of
fifteen
lunations
or
many
observers
avoid
the
observation
of
objects
under
a
high
light
this
however
should
never
be
neglected
when
practicable
though
in
some
cases
it
is
not
easy
to
carry
out
owing
to
the
difficulty
in
tracing
details
under
these
circumstances
although
to
observe
successfully
the
minuter
features
such
as
the
rills
and
the
smaller
craterlets
requires
instruments
of
large
aperture
located
in
favourable
situations
yet
work
of
permanent
value
may
be
accomplished
with
comparatively
humble
telescopic
means
a
inch
achromatic
or
a
reflector
of
or
inches
aperture
will
reveal
on
a
good
night
many
details
which
have
not
yet
been
recorded
and
the
possessor
of
instruments
of
this
size
will
not
be
long
in
discovering
that
the
moon
despite
of
what
is
often
said
has
not
been
so
exhaustively
surveyed
that
nothing
remains
for
him
to
do
only
experience
and
actual
trial
will
teach
the
observer
to
choose
the
particular
eyepiece
suitable
for
a
given
night
or
a
given
object
it
will
be
found
that
it
is
only
on
very
rare
occasions
that
he
can
accomplish
much
with
powers
which
perhaps
only
on
two
or
three
nights
in
a
year
in
this
climate
tell
to
great
advantage
though
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
employment
of
an
eyepiece
otherwise
unsuitable
for
the
night
will
during
a
short
spell
of
good
definition
afford
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
some
difficult
feature
and
thus
solve
a
doubtful
point
it
has
often
been
said
that
the
efficiency
of
a
telescope
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
the
man
at
the
eye
end
this
is
as
true
in
the
case
of
the
moon
as
it
is
in
other
branches
of
observational
astronomy
observers
especially
beginners
frequently
fall
into
great
error
in
failing
to
appreciate
the
true
character
of
what
they
see
in
this
way
a
shallow
surface
depression
possibly
only
a
few
feet
below
the
general
level
of
the
neighbouring
country
is
often
described
as
a
vast
gorge
because
under
very
oblique
light
it
is
filled
with
black
shadow
or
an
insignificant
hillock
is
magnified
into
a
mountain
when
similarly
viewed
hence
the
importance
just
insisted
on
of
studying
lunar
features
under
as
many
conditions
as
possible
before
finally
attempting
to
describe
them
however
indifferent
a
draughtsman
an
observer
may
be
if
he
endeavours
to
portray
what
he
sees
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
will
ultimately
attain
sufficient
skill
to
make
his
work
useful
for
future
reference
in
any
case
it
will
be
of
more
value
than
a
mere
verbal
description
without
a
sketch
doubt
and
uncertainty
invariably
attend
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
written
notes
unaccompanied
by
drawings
as
some
recent
controversies
respecting
changes
in
linne
and
elsewhere
testify
now
that
photographs
are
generally
available
to
form
the
basis
of
a
more
complete
sketch
much
of
the
difficulty
formerly
attending
the
correct
representation
of
the
outline
and
grosser
features
of
a
formation
has
been
removed
and
the
observer
can
devote
his
time
and
attention
to
the
insertion
and
description
of
less
obvious
objects
progress
of
till
within
recent
years
the
systematic
study
of
the
lunar
surface
may
be
said
to
have
been
confined
in
this
country
at
any
rate
to
a
very
limited
number
of
observers
and
except
in
rare
instances
those
who
possessed
astronomical
telescopes
only
directed
them
to
the
moon
as
a
show
object
to
excite
the
wonder
of
casual
visitors
the
publication
of
webb
celestial
objects
in
the
supposed
physical
change
in
the
crater
linne
announced
in
and
the
appearance
of
an
unrecorded
black
spot
near
hyginus
some
ten
years
later
had
the
effect
of
awakening
a
more
lively
interest
in
selenography
and
undoubtedly
combined
to
bring
about
a
change
in
this
respect
which
ultimately
resulted
in
the
number
of
amateurs
devoting
much
of
their
time
to
this
branch
of
observational
astronomy
being
notably
increased
still
large
telescopes
as
a
rule
held
aloof
for
some
unexplained
reason
or
were
only
employed
in
a
desultory
and
spasmodic
fashion
without
any
very
definite
object
when
the
council
of
the
british
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
stimulated
by
the
linne
controversy
deemed
the
moon
to
be
worthy
of
passing
attention
observations
directed
to
objects
suspected
of
change
the
phenomena
on
the
floor
of
plato
were
left
to
three
or
four
observers
under
the
able
direction
of
birt
the
largest
instruments
available
being
an
inch
reflector
and
the
crossley
refractor
of
inches
aperture
during
the
last
decade
however
all
this
has
been
changed
and
we
not
only
have
societies
such
as
the
british
astronomical
association
setting
apart
a
distinct
section
for
the
systematic
investigation
of
lunar
detail
but
some
of
the
largest
and
most
perfect
instruments
in
the
world
among
them
the
noble
refractor
on
mount
hamilton
employed
in
photographing
the
moon
or
in
scrutinising
her
manifold
features
by
direct
observation
hence
it
may
be
said
that
selenography
has
taken
a
new
and
more
promising
departure
which
among
other
results
must
lead
to
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
lunar
topography
and
settle
possibly
ere
long
the
vexed
question
of
change
without
any
residuum
of
doubt
lunar
photography
as
exemplified
by
the
marvellous
and
beautiful
pictures
produced
at
the
lick
observatory
under
the
auspices
of
holden
and
the
exquisite
enlargements
of
them
by

of

at

by
the
brothers
henry
and
at
brussels
by
prinz
point
to
the
not
far
distant
time
when
we
shall
possess
complete
photographic
maps
on
a
large
scale
of
the
whole
visible
disc
under
various
phases
of
illumination
which
will
be
of
inestimable
value
as
topographical
charts
when
this
is
accomplished
the
observer
will
have
at
his
command
faithful
representations
of
any
formation
or
of
any
given
region
he
may
require
to
utilise
for
the
study
of
the
smaller
details
by
direct
observation
desultory
and
objectless
drawings
and
notes
have
hitherto
been
more
or
less
characteristic
of
the
work
done
even
by
those
who
have
given
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
the
moon
though
these
if
duly
recorded
are
valuable
as
illustrating
the
physical
structure
the
estimated
brightness
under
various
phases
and
other
peculiarities
of
lunar
features
they
do
not
materially
forward
investigations
relating
to
the
discovery
of
present
lunar
activity
or
to
the
detection
of
actual
change
it
is
reiterated
in
many
popular
books
that
the
moon
is
a
changeless
world
and
it
is
implied
that
having
attained
a
state
when
no
further
manifestations
of
internal
or
external
forces
are
possible
it
revolves
round
the
earth
in
the
condition
for
the
most
part
of
a
globular
mass
of
vesicular
lava
or
slag
possessing
no
interest
except
as
a
notable
example
of
a
planet
in
answer
to
these
dogmatic
assertions
it
may
be
said
that
notwithstanding
the
multiplication
of
monographs
and
photographs
the
knowledge
we
possess
even
of
the
larger
and
more
prominent
objects
is
far
too
slight
to
justify
us
in
maintaining
that
changes
which
on
earth
we
should
use
a
strong
adjective
to
describe
have
not
taken
place
in
connection
with
some
of
them
in
recent
years
would
the
most
assiduous
observer
assert
that
his
knowledge
of
any
one
of
the
great
formations
in
the
quadrant
for
example
is
so
complete
that
if
a
chasm
as
big
as
the
val
del
bove
was
blown
out
from
its
flanks
or
formed
by
a
landslip
he
would
detect
the
change
in
the
appearance
of
an
area
some
three
miles
by
four
thus
brought
about
unless
he
had
previously
made
a
very
prolonged
and
exhaustive
study
of
the
object
or
again
among
formations
of
a
different
class
the
craters
and
might
not
objects
as
large
as
monte
nuovo
or
jorullo
come
into
existence
in
many
regions
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
it
would
certainly
have
needed
a
persistent
lunar
astronomer
and
one
furnished
with
a
very
perfect
telescope
to
have
noted
the
changes
that
have
occurred
within
the
old
of
somma
or
among
the
santorin
group
during
the
past
thirty
years
or
even
to
have
detected
the
effects
resulting
from
the
great
catastrophe
in
at
vesuvius
yet
these
objects
are
no
larger
than
many
which
if
they
were
situated
on
our
satellite
would
be
termed
comparatively
small
if
not
insignificant
one
of
the
principal
aims
of
lunar
research
is
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
as

the

one
qualified
to
give
an
opinion
will
admit
that
this
can
not
be
accomplished
by
roaming
at
large
over
the
whole
visible
superficies
but
only
by
confining
attention
to
selected
areas
of
limited
extent
and
recording
and
describing
every
object
visible
thereon
under
various
conditions
of
illumination
with
the
greatest
accuracy
attainable
this
plan
was
suggested
and
inaugurated
nearly
thirty
years
ago
by
birt
under
the
patronage
of
the
british
association
but
as
he
proposed
to
deal
with
the
entire
disc
in
this
way
the
magnitude
and
ambitious
character
of
the
scheme
soon
damped
the
ardour
of
those
who
at
first
supported
it
and
it
was
ultimately
abandoned
it
was
however
based
on
the
only
feasible
principle
which
as
it
seems
to
the
writer
will
not
result
in
doubt
and
confusion
now
that
photography
has
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
observer
birt
proposal
if
confined
within
narrower
limits
would
be
far
less
arduous
an
undertaking
than
before
and
might
be
easily
carried
out
a
complete
photographic
survey
of
a
few
selected
regions
as
a
basis
for
an
equally
thorough
and
exhaustive
scrutiny
by
direct
observation
would
it
is
believed
lead
to
a
much
more
satisfactory
and
hopeful
method
for
ultimately
furnishing

flanked
both

there
is
a

conspicuous
mountain
in
the
interior
of

i
have
seen
a
long
ridge
where
schmidt
shows
some
hillocks
two
fine

a
very
similar
position
on

at
the
inner
foot
of

on
several
occasions
when
observing
this

and
the
vicinity
i
have
been
struck
by
its
peculiar
colour
under

at
this

the

an
especially
interesting
object
when
observed
under
a
low
angle

its
complex
border
though
roughly
circular
displays
many
irregularities
in
outline
due
mainly
to
rows

the
best
view
of
it
is
obtained
when
the

at
this
phase
if
libration
is
favourable
the
manifold
details
of
its
very
uneven

are
best
seen
on
the

a
group
of
large
craters
associated
with
a

seen
many
more

it

only
when
the

the

this
though
only
about
miles
in
diameter
is
an
object
especially
worthy
of
examination
under
every
phase
at
sunrise
and
for
some
time
afterwards
owing
to
the
superior
altitude
of
the
section
of

a
considerable
portion
of
the

on

masked
by
its

thus
appears
to
destroy
its
continuity
on
more
than
one
occasion
friends
to
whom
i
have
shown
this
object
under
these
conditions
have
likened
it
to
a
breached
volcanic
cone
a
comparison
which
at
a
later
stage
is
seen
to
be
very
inappropriate
the

terraced

exhibits
many
spurs
and
buttresses

far
too
complicated
to
be
intelligibly
described
in
words
it
lies
on
the
side
of
the
meridian
passing
through
the
formation
and
extends
from
the
side
of
rhaeticus
to
the
lying
between
ukert
and
hyginus
on
the
birt
likened
these
rills
to
an
inverted
river
system
a
comparison
which
will
commend
itself
to
most
observers
who
have
seen
them
on
a
good
night
for
in
many
instances
they
appear
to
become
wider
and
deeper
as
they
approach
higher
ground
published
maps
are
all
more
or
less
defective
in
their
representations
of
them

as

that
portion
of
the

lying
of

deep
depression
rather
less
than
miles
across

a
low

nearly
parallel
to
the
eastern

it
approaches
hyginus
it
becomes
gradually
coarser

exhibits
many
expansions
and
contractions
the
former
in
many
cases
evidently
representing
craters
when
the
phase
is
favourable
it
can
be
followed
across
the
floor
of
hyginus

i
have
frequently
seen
the
banks
with
which
it
appears
to
be
bounded
at
any
rate
within
the
formation
standing
out

turns
somewhat
more

between
its
origin
of

discovered
with

plosel
dialyte
telescope
a
dark
apparent
depression
without
a
rim
in
the
mare
vaporum
a
few
miles
of
hyginus
which
from
twelve
years
acquaintance
with
the
region
he
was
certain
had
not
been
visible
during
that
period
on
the
announcement
of
this
discovery
in
the
fur
in
march
of
the
following
year
the
existence
of
the
object
described
by
klein
was
confirmed
and
it
was
sedulously
scrutinised
under
various
solar
altitudes
to
most
observers
it
appeared
as
an
object
with
a
somewhat
nebulous
border
standing
on
an
dusky
area
with
two
or
more
small
dark
craters
and
many
low
ridges
in
its
vicinity
a
little
of
it
stands
a
curious
spiral
mountain
called
the
schneckenberg
the
question
as
to
whether
hyginus
as
the
dusky
spot
is
called
is
a
new
object
or
not
can
not
be
definitely
determined
as
in
spite
of
a
strong
case
in
favour
of
it
being
so
there
remains
a
residuum
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
that
can
never
be
entirely
cleared
away
after
weighing
however
all
that
can
be
said
for
and
against
the
hypothesis
of

seems
to
be
the
most
probable
this
bright
crater
miles

situated
in
the

of

surrounded
by
a
very
complicated
arrangement
of
mountains
and
on

flanked
by
other
enclosures
it

its
most
noteworthy
feature
is
the
great

more
than
miles
long
which
extends
from

this
gorge
is
at

six
miles

sulpicius
another

about
miles

rising
to
a
considerable
height
above

its
shadow
under
a
low

is
prominently
jagged
on

are
two
bright
mounds
and
of
that
which
is
nearer
the
border
of

commences
a
cleft
which
following
the
curvature
of
the

terminates
at
a
point
in
long
deg
this
object
varies
considerably
in
width
and
depth
another
shorter
and
coarser
cleft
runs
of
this
across
an
irregularly
shaped
bay
or
inflexion
in
the

this
one
of
the
most
brilliant

in

about
miles

a
bright

crater
miles
in

on
the
half

and
the
largest

thereon
its

depressed
some

while
the
walls
rising
nearly
feet
above

have
peaks
both
on

about
feet
higher
the
shadows
of
these
features
noted
by
schroter
in
and
by
many
subsequent
observers
are
very
noteworthy
i
have
seen
the
shadow
of
a
third
peak
about
midway
between

one
may
faintly
imagine
the
magnificent
prospect
of

with
the

range
which
would
be
obtained
were
it
possible
to
stand
on
the
summit
of
one
of
these
elevations
it
is
doubtful
whether
bessel
has
a
central
mountain
neither
madler
nor
schmidt
have
seen
one
though
webb
noted
a
peak
on
two
occasions
i
fail
to
see
anything
within
the
crater
the
bright
streak
crossing
the
mare
from
to
passes
through
bessel
a
formation
on
the
side
of
the
mare
serenitatis
described
by
lohrmann
and
madler
as
a
deep
crater
but
which
in
was
found
by
schmidt
to
have
lost
all
the
appearance
of
one
the
announcement
of
this
apparent
change
led
to
a
critical
examination
of
the
object
by
most
of
the
leading
observers
and
to
a
controversy
which
if
it
had
no
other
result
tended
to
awaken
an
interest
in
selenography
that
has
been
maintained
ever
since
according
to
madler
the
crater
was
more
than
miles
in
diameter
in
his
time
and
very
conspicuous
under
a
low
sun
a
description
to
which
it
certainly
did
not
answer
in
or
at
any
subsequent
epoch
it
is
anything
but
an
easy
object
to
see
well
as
there
is
a
want
of
definiteness
about
it
under
the
best
conditions
though
the
minute
crater
the
low
ridges
and
the
nebulous
whiteness
described
by
schmidt
and
noted
by
webb
and
others
are
traceable
at
the
proper
phase
as
in
the
case
of
hyginus
n
there
are
still
many
sceptics
as
regards
actual
change
despite
the
records
of
lohrmann
and
madler
but
the
evidence
in
favour
of
it
seems
to
preponderate
a

its

which
scarcely
differs
from
that
of
the
surrounding
surface
render
it
difficult
to
trace
under
a
high

and
perhaps
accounts
for
the
fact
that
it
escaped
the
notice
of

though
it
is
certainly
strange
that
a

should
have
been
overlooked
while

the

at

has
been
appropriately
compared
to

it
abuts
on

projecting
westwards
considerably
diminish
the
width
of
the

south
of
this
lies
another
curved
mountain
ring
which
still
farther
narrows
it
this
curtailment
in
width
represents
the
neck
of
the
flask
and
is
apparently
about
or
miles
in
length
and
from

miles
in
breadth
forming
a
gorge
bordered
on
the
by
nearly
vertical
cliffs
towering
thousands
of

above

bottom
of

on
the
by

of
still
greater
altitude
at
the
entrance
to
the
amphitheatre
the
actual
distance
between
the
colossal
rocks
which
flank
the
defile
is
certainly
not
much
more
than
miles
from
this
standpoint
the
view
across
the
level
interior
of
the
elliptical
plain
would
be
of
extraordinary
magnificence
towards
the
but
more
than
miles
distant
the
outlook
of
an
observer
would
be
limited
by
some
of
the
loftiest
peaks
of
the
alps
whose
flanks
form
the
boundary
of
the
enclosure
through
which
however
by
at
least
three
narrow
passes
he
might
perchance
get
a
glimpse
of
the

it
is
hardly
more
than
a

wide
at
its
commencement
on
the

of

expands
rapidly
into
a
gorge
flanked
on
either
side
by
the
towering
heights
of

the

in

north
of
this

which
abounds
in
little

that
in

gruithuisen
discovered
a
very
remarkable
formation
consisting
of
a
number
of
parallel
rows
of
hills
branching
out
like
the

of
a

from

depression
between
two
long
ridges
running
from
north
to
south
the
regularly
arranged
hollows
between
the
hills
and
the
longitudinal
valley
suggested
to
his
fertile
imagination
that
he
had
at
last
found
a
veritable
city
in
the
moon
possibly
the
metropolis
of
kepler
who
were
supposed
to
dwell
on
that
hemisphere
of
our
satellite
which
faces
the
earth
at
any
rate
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
the
work
of
intelligent
beings
and
not
due
to
natural
causes
this
curious
arrangement
of
ridges
and
furrows
which
according
to
webb
measures
about
miles
both
in
length
and
breadth
is
owing
to
the
shallowness
of
the
component
hills
and
valleys
a
very
difficult
object
to
see
in
its
entirety
as
it
must
be
viewed
when
close
to
the
terminator
and
even
then
the
sun
azimuth
and
good
definition
do
not
always
combine
to
afford
a
satisfactory
glimpse
of
its

gaudibert
has
given
a

of
it
in

much
smaller

the
rough
hilly
district
about
midway
between

is
remarkable
for
its
peculiar
dusky
tone
and
for
certain
small
dark
spots
first
seen
by
schmidt
and
subsequently
carefully
observed
by
klein
the
noteworthy
region
where
these
peculiar
features
are
found
represents
an
area
of
many
thousand
square
miles
and
must
resemble
a
veritable
covered
probably
with
an
incalculable
number
of
craters
vents
cones
and
pits
filled
with
volcanic
it
is
among
details
of
this
character
that
the
true
analogues
of
some
terrestrial
volcanoes
must
be
looked
for
under
a
low
angle
of
illumination
the
surface
presents
an
extraordinarily
rough
aspect
well
worthy
of
examination
but
the
dusky
areas
and
the
black
spots
can
only
be
satisfactorily
distinguished
under
a
somewhat
high
sun
i
have
however
seen
them
fairly
well
when
the

a
noble

a
worthy
termination
of

the
best
view
of

is
obtained
under

illumination
when
the

about

a
narrow
break
in

the

seems
to
overlap

remarkable
for
the
great
width
of
its

exhibits
a
marked
departure
from
circularity
especially
on
the
where
the
wall
consists
of
two
linear
sections
with
an
intermediate
portion
where
the
crest
for
miles
or
more
bends
inwards
or
towards
the
centre
from
the
flank
of
this
formation

towards
the

if
this
magnificent
object
is
observed
when
the
morning
terminator
falls
a
little

it
affords
a
spectacle
not
easily
forgotten
i
have
often
seen
it
at
this
phase
when
its
broad
mass
of
shadow
extended
across
the
of
copernicus
some
of
the
component
craters
appearing
between
the
spires
of

representing
the
loftiest
peaks
on

there
is
a
prominent
little
crater
on
the
crest
of
the
arm
between
two
of
the
peaks
and
another
on
the
plain
to
the
west
an
inconspicuous
though
a
very
interesting
formation
miles
in
diameter
of
copernicus
with
a
border
scarcely
exceeding
feet
in
height
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
was
for
a
long
time
altogether
overlooked
by
madler
except
as
a
known
object
it
is
only
traceable
under
very
oblique
illumination
and
even
then
some
attention
is
required
before
its
very
attenuated
wall
can
be
followed
all
round
it
is
most
prominent
on
the
where
it
apparently
consists
of
a
extension
of
the
eratosthenes
and
is
associated
with
a
number
of
little
craters
and
pits
this
is
succeeded
on
the
by
a
narrow
strip
of
bright
wall
and
on
the
by
a
section
made
up
of
a
piece
of
straight
wall
and
a
strip
curving
inwards
forming
the
side
on
the
the
border
assumes
a
very
ghostly
character
and
appears
to
be
mainly
defined
by
rows
of
small
depressions
and
mounds
on
the
and
it
is
still
lower
and
narrower
so
much
so
that
it
is
only
for
an
hour
or
so
after
sunrise
or
before
sunset
that
it
can
be
traced
at
all
on
every
side
with
the
exception
of
the
curved
piece
on
the
the
wall
consists
of
linear
sections
the
interior
contains
a
great
number
of
little
craters
and
very
low
longitudinal
mounds
ten
craters
are
shown
in

and
madler
map
schmidt
only
draws
fifteen
though
in
the
text
accompanying
his

he
says
that
he
once
counted
fifty

the
monograph
published
in
the
of
the
liverpool
astronomical
society
vol
part
are
represented
they
appear
to
be
rather
more
numerous
on
the
half
of
the
floor
than
elsewhere
just
beyond
the
limits
of
the
border
on
the
is
a
bright
crater
with
a
much
larger
obscure
depression
on
the
of
it
the
former
is
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
minute
craters
and
which
are
easily
seen
under
a
low
sun
though
almost
every
trace
of
stadius
disappears
under
a
high
light
i
have
had
little
difficulty
in
seeing
portions
of
the
border
and
some
of
the
included
details
when
the
morning
terminator
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
wall
of
herodotus
and
the
site
was
traversed
by
innumerable
light
streaks
radiating
from
copernicus
at
this
phase
the
bright
crater
just
mentioned
on
the
edge
of
the
border
was
tolerably
distinct
this
is
without
question
the
grandest
object
not
only
on
the
second
quadrant
but
on
the
whole
visible
superficies
of
the
moon
it
undoubtedly
owes
its
supremacy
partly
to
its
comparative
isolation
on
the
surface
of
a
vast
plain
where
there
are
no
neighbouring
formations
to
vie
with
it
in
size
and
magnificence
but
partly
also
to
its
favourable
position
which
is
such
that
though
not
central
is
sufficiently
removed
from
the
limb
to
allow
all
its
manifold
details
to
be
critically
examined
without
much
foreshortening
there
are
some
other
formations
langrenus
and
petavius
for
example
which
if
they
were
equally
well
situated
would
probably
be
fully
as
striking
but
as
we
see
it
copernicus
is
the
monarch
of
the
lunar
schmidt
remarks
that
this
incomparable
object
combines
nearly
all
the
characteristics
of
the
other
and
that
careful
study
directed
to
its
unequalled
beauties
and
magnificent
form
is
of
much
more
value
than
that
devoted
to
a
hundred
other
objects
of
the
same
class
it
is
fully
miles
in
diameter
and
though
generally
described
as
nearly
circular
exhibits
very
distinctly
under
high
powers
a
polygonal
outline
approximating
very
closely
to
an
equilateral
hexagon
there
are
however
two
sections
of
the
crest
of
the
border
on
the
which
are
inflected
slightly
towards
the
centre
a
peculiarity
already
noticed
in
the
case
of
eratosthenes
the
walls
tolerably
uniform
in
height
are
surmounted
by
a
great
number
of
peaks
one
of
which
on
the
according
to
neison
stands
feet
above

and
a
second
on
the
opposite

is
nearly
as

both
the
inner

of

one
of

equally
interesting

the
border
is
devoid
of
detail
on
the
three
little
notches
may
be
detected
on

probably
represent
small

which
communicates
with

formation
along
the
side
of

the
great
serpentine
cleft
discovered
by
schroter
october
is
in
many
respects
the
most
interesting
object
of
its
class
it
commences
at
the
end
of
a
short
wide
valley
traversing
mountains
some
distance
of
herodotus
as
a
comparatively
delicate
cleft
after
following
a
somewhat
irregular
course
towards
the
for
about
miles
and
becoming
gradually
wider
and
deeper
it
makes
a
sudden
turn
and
runs
for
about
miles
in
a
direction
it
then
changes
its
course
as
abruptly
to
the
again
for
or
miles
once
more
turns
to
the
and
as
a
much
coarser
chasm
maintains
this
direction
for
about
miles
till
it
reaches
the
edge
of
a
great
mountain
plateau
of
aristarchus
when
it
swerves
slightly
towards
the
becoming
wider
and
wider
up
to
a
place
a
few
miles
of
herodotus
where
it
expands
into
a
broad
valley
and
then
somewhat
suddenly
contracting
in
width
and
becoming
less
coarse
enters
the
through
a
gap
in
the
wall
as
before
mentioned
i
always
find
that
portion
of
the
valley
in
the
neighbourhood
of
herodotus
more
or
less
indistinct
though
it
is
broad
and
deep
this
part
of
it

the

unrivalled
for

perhaps
received
more
attention
from

be
observed
under
many
phases
before

can
clearly
comprehend
its
distinctive

very
deficient
on

be
distinguished
by
a
faint

moreover
be
easily
traced
in
a

after
making
a
detour
towards

runs
partially
round

far
more
irregular
in

exhibiting
many
linear
sections
its
crest
on

clearly
inflected
towards
the

a
peculiarity
that
has
already
been
noticed
in
connection
with
copernicus
and
some
other
objects
on
the
inner
slope
of
this
wall
there
is
a
large
bright
crater
in
connection
with
which
have
been
detected
two
delicate
rills
extending
to
the
summit
i
have
not
seen
these
but
one
of
the
shown
by
schmidt
between
this
crater
and
the
crest
has
often
been
noted
the
wall
is
very
remarkable
it
appears
to
be
partially
wrecked
if
observed
at
an
early
stage
of
sunrise
a
great
number
of
undulating
ridges
and
rows
of
hillocks
will
be
seen
crossing
the
region
of
theophilus
they
resemble
a
consolidated
stream
of
ropy
lava
which
has
flowed
through
and
over
the
wall
and
down
the
the
arrangement
of
the
ridges
within
cyrillus
is
very
noteworthy
as
is
also
the
triple
mountain
near
the
centre
of
the
floor
the
fine
curved
cleft
thereon
traverses
the
side
sweeping
round
the
central
mountains
and
then
turning
to
the
south
i
have
only
occasionally
seen
it
in
its
entirety
there
are
also
two
oblong
dark
patches
on
the
side
of
the
interior
the
wall
of
cyrillus
is
broken
by
a
narrow
pass
opening
out
into
a
valley
situated
on
the
plateau
which
bounds
the
side
of
the
oblong
formation
lying
between
it
and
catherina
and
overlooking
a
curious
shallow
enclosure
abutting
on
the
side
of
cyrillus
the
largest
of
the
three
great
formations
a
with
a
very
irregular
outline
extending
more
than
miles
in
a
meridional
direction
and
of
still
greater
width
the
wall
is
comparatively
narrow
and
low
on
the
feet
above
the
floor
but
on
the
it
rises
to
more
than
double
this
height
and
is
broken
by
some
large
depressions
the
inner
slope
on
the
is
very
gentle
and
includes
two
bright
craters
but
exhibits
only
slight
indications
of
terraces
the
most
remarkable
features
on
an
otherwise
even
interior
are
the
large
low
narrow
ring
with
a
crater
within
it
occupying
fully
a
third
of
the
area
of
the
floor
and
a
large
on
the
side
the
interest
attaching
to
this
formation
is
not
to
be
measured
by
its
size
for
it
is
only
about
miles
in
diameter
but
by
the
remarkable
character
of
its
surroundings
its
bright
regular
wall
rising
feet
on
the
and
only
about
half
as
much
on
the
above
a
rather
dark
interior
is
everywhere
continuous
except
at
one
place
on
the
here
there
is
a
narrow
gap
flanked
on
the
by
a
somewhat
obscure
little
crater
through
which
a
curious
bent
ridge
coming
up
from
the
passes
and
extending
on
to
the
floor
expands
into
something
resembling
a
central
mountain
under
a
high
sun
madler
has
a
very
peculiar
appearance
the
lofty
wall
is
barely
perceptible
while
the
much
lower
border
is
conspicuously
brilliant
and
the
half
of
the
floor
is
dark
while
the
remainder
with
two
objects
representing
the
loftier
portions
of
the
intrusive
ridge
is
prominently
white
under
an
evening
sun
with
the
terminator
lying
some
distance
to
the
a
very
remarkable
obscure
ring
with
a
low
border
a
valley
running
round
it
on
the
side
and
two
large
central
mounds
may
be
easily
traced
this
object
is
connected
with
madler
by
what
appears
to
be
under
a
higher
sun
a
bright
marking
in
connection
with
which
i
have
often
suspected
a
delicate
cleft
between
the
bend
of
this
object
and
the
wall
of
madler
two
large
circular
dark
spots
may
be
seen
under
a
high
sun
and
on
the
surface
of
the
mare
of
it
a
great
number
of
delicate
white
spots
a
about
miles
in
diameter
on
the
side
of
the
mare
nectaris
midway
between
theophilus
and
fracastorius
with
the
side
of
which
it
is
connected
by
a
chain
of
large
depressions
its
border
is
lofty
regular
and
continuous
on
the
and
but
on
the
it
is
low
and
on
the
sinks
to
such
a
very
inconsiderable
height
that
it
is
often
scarcely
traceable
it
exhibits
two
breaks
on
the
through
one
of
which
passes
a
coarse
valley
that
ultimately
runs
on
the
side
of
the
depressions
just
referred
to
the
interior
is
pitted
with
many
craters
one
on
the
side
being
shallow
but
of
considerable
size
i
once
counted
twenty
with
a
inch
cooke
achromatic
and
sheldon
of
macclesfield
subsequently
noted
many
more
a
ridge
prominent
under
oblique
light
follows
a
winding
course
from
the
side
of
beaumont
to
the
side
of
theophilus
and
there
is
another
lower
ridge
of
it
between
them
is
included
a
region
covered
with
minute
hillocks
and
asperities
among
these
objects
are
certain
dusky
little
which
klein
of
cologne
regards
as
true
analogues
of
some
terrestrial
volcanoes
they
are
very
similar
in
character
to
those
already
alluded
to
in
the
dusky
area
between
copernicus
and
gambart
a
conspicuous
miles
in

a
mountain
mass
projecting
from
the
of
the
mare
on
which
there
is
a
peak
rising
to
more
than
feet
above
the
surface
this
great
bay
or
inflexion
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
mare
nectaris
about
miles
in
diameter
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
suggestive
examples
of
a
partially
destroyed
formation
to
be
found
on
the
visible
surface
the
section
of
the
rampart
is
practically
complete
and
unbroken
rising
at
one
peak
to
a
height
of
feet
above
the
interior
it
is
very
broad
at
its
end
and
its
inner
slope
descends
with
a
gentle
gradient
to
the
floor
towards
the
however
it
rapidly
decreases
in
width
but
apparently
not
in
altitude
till
near
its
bright
pointed
extremity
under
a
low
sun
some
long
deformed
crateriform
depressions
may
be
seen
on
the
slope
and
a
bright
little
crater
on
the
crest
of
the
border
near
its
end
the
southern
rampart
is
broken
by
three
large
craters
and
a
fine
valley
running
some
distance
in
a
direction
which
diminishes
gradually
in
width
till
it
ultimately
resembles
a
cleft
and
terminates
at
a
small
crater
the
border
is
very
lofty
and
irregular
rising
at
the
corner
of
the
large
triangular
formation
which
is
such
a
prominent
feature
upon
it
to
a
height
of
feet
and
at
a
point
on
the
to
considerably
more
than
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
former
peak
it
becomes
much
lower
and
narrower
and
is
finally
only
represented
by
a
very
attenuated
strip
of
wall
hardly
more
prominent
than
the
brighter
portions
of
the
border
of
stadius
at
sunrise
terminating
at
an
obscure
between
this
and
the
pointed
termination
of
the
border
there
is
a
wide
gap
open
to
the
north
for
a
space
of
about
miles
appearing
except
under
very
oblique
illumination
as
smooth
and
as
devoid
of
detail
as
the
grey
surface
of
the
mare
nectaris
itself
if
however
this
interval
is
observed
at
sunrise
or
sunset
it
is
seen
to
be
not
quite
so
structureless
as
it
appears
under
different
conditions
for
a
number
of
mounds
and
large
humpy
swellings
with
low
hills
and
craterlets
extend
across
it
and
occupy
a
position
which
we
are
justified
in
regarding
as
the
site
of
a
section
of
the
rampart
which
from
some
cause
or
other
has
been
completely
destroyed
and
overlaid
with
the
material
whatever
this
may
be
of
the
mare
nectaris
the
floor
of
fracastorius
is
as
regards
the
light
streaks
and
other
features
upon
it
only
second
in
interest
to
those
of

and
archimedes
and

repay
systematic
observation
between
thirty
and
forty
light
spots

been
recorded
on

at
the
edges
of
the
light
streaks

the
higher
portion
of

interior
near
the

is
a
curious
object
consisting
apparently
of
four
light
spots
arranged
in
a
square
with
a
craterlet
in
the
middle
all
of
which
undergo
as
i
have
pointed
out
elsewhere
notable
changes
of

there
are
at

two
distinct

floor
one
running
from
the
wall
towards
the

another
on

out
two
branches
towards

the
idea
